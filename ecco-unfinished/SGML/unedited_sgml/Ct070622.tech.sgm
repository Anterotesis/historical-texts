<P>_I Am &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the Nicety of
the following Subject, and the
Ill-nature of the Age, that tho'
I have <HI>Introduc'd</HI> it with all the Pro|te&s;tations
of a re&s;olv'd Caution, and of
tying my &s;elf down to all po&s;&s;ible Mode&s;ty
in the whole Work; and tho' I have <HI>con|cluded</HI>
it with due Explanations, and a free
Appeal to the mo&s;t impartial Judges, yet I
cannot but add a Word of <HI>Preface.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="4">
THE ju&s;tne&s;s of the Satyr, the loud
Calls which the Crimes (here reproved)
make for Ju&s;tice and a due Cen&s;ure, the
dreadful Ruin of the People's Morals, and
the apparent Contempt of Mode&s;ty and De|cency,
which grows &s;o vi&s;ibly upon us by
the &s;hamele&s;s Practice of what is here re|prov'd,
join all together to vindicate this
Undertaking, and to &s;how not the U&s;eful|ne&s;s
only, but the Nece&s;&s;ity of it.</P>
<P>IT is almo&s;t thirty Years &s;ince the
Author began this Piece: He has all that
Time heard, with a ju&s;t Concern, the Com|plaints
of good Men upon the hateful Sub|ect.
The Grave and the Sober, the Lovers
of Virtue and of Religion, have, with
Grief, expre&s;s'd them&s;elves upon the grow|ing
Scandal; and they have often pre&s;s'd
him to fini&s;h and bring out this Reproof;
and have join'd with his Opinion of the
Ju&s;tice of it.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="5">
HITHERTO he has been reluctant
as to the publi&s;hing it, and partly on Ac|count
of his Years, for it was long &s;ince
fini&s;hed, and partly in hopes of Reformation;
but now, de&s;pairing of Amendment, grown
OLD, and out of the reach of Scandal,
and of all the Pretences to it; <HI>Sincerely
aiming</HI> at the Reformation of the Guilty,
and <HI>de&s;pi&s;ing</HI> all unju&s;t Reproaches from a
vitious Age, he clo&s;es his Days with this
Satyr; which he is &s;o far from &s;eeing Cau&s;e
to be a&s;hamed of, that he hopes he &s;hall
not, where he is going to, Account for
it.</P>
<P>AT lea&s;t, he can Appeal to that
Judge, who he is &s;oon to come before,
that as he has done it with an upright
Intention, for the good of Mankind, &s;o he
has u&s;ed his utmo&s;t Endeavour to perform
it, in a Manner the lea&s;t liable to Re|flection,
and, in his Judgment, the mo&s;t
<PB N="vi" REF="6">
likely to an&s;wer the true End of it, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
the Reformation of the Crime. And with
this Satisfaction, he comfortably prays for
its Succe&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>THE
INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>_IT is certainly true, that Mode&s;ty
is no natural Virtue; what the
<HI>Latins</HI> call'd <HI>Pudor</HI> or <HI>Shamefaced|ne&s;s,</HI>
is the Effect of Crime, and
is always occa&s;ioned by a Con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
of Guilt, whether it be
actual Guilt, or intentional, Guilt of a Fact al|ready
committed, or Guilt of a Crime re&s;olv'd
on, 'tis much the &s;ame.</P>
<P>BEFORE <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> knew <HI>Evil</HI> as well as
<HI>Good,</HI> before they were con&s;cious of Offence,
they went naked, and blu&s;h'd not, and 'tis mo&s;t
&s;ignificantly expre&s;s'd, <HI>they knew not that they
were naked;</HI> they knew not that Nakedne&s;s was
a Turpitude, an Indecency, and therefore when
<HI>Adam</HI> gives that poor, fooli&s;h Excu&s;e for hiding
him&s;elf from the Eyes of the infinite Author
of Sight, and &s;ays, <HI>becau&s;e he was naked,</HI> Gen. iii.
10, 11. GOD asks him, <HI>Who told thee that thou
wa&s;t naked.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="10">
DOUBTLESS before the Fall, Innocence was
given to Man for a Covering, and he not only
knew not that he was naked, but he really <HI>was
not naked,</HI> though he was not clothed; he knew
not how to blu&s;h at being <HI>naked,</HI> much le&s;s why.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame Innocence is the Protection of Vir|tue
to this Day in the untaught Savages in ma|ny
Parts of the now known World, where Na|kedne&s;s
is no Offence on one &s;ide, no Snare, no
Incaentive on the other; but Cu&s;tom being the
Judge of Decency to them, takes away all Sen&s;e
of Indecency in going uncovered, whether in
whole, or in Part. See Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> upon that
Head:
<Q><L>God-like Erect, with Native Honour clad</L>
<L>In Naked Maje&s;ty&mdash;</L>
<L>So pa&s;s'd they Naked on, nor &s;hunn'd the Sight</L>
<L>Of GOD or Angel, for they thought no Ill.</L>
<BIBL><HI>Milton,</HI> Par. fol. 95.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>NOW the &s;ame Cu&s;tom in the&s;e Northern
Parts having concurr'd with the Nece&s;&s;ity of
the Climate on one Hand, and the Laws of
Religion on the other, to cloath and cover
the Body; the Breach of that Cu&s;tom would be a
Breach of Decency, and a Breach of the Laws
both of God and Man.</P>
<P>HENCE <HI>Mode&s;ty</HI> &s;ucceeds, whether as a Virtue
in it &s;elf, or as an Appendix to Virtue, we will
not di&s;pute; but where the Rules of Decency
are broken, a Sen&s;e of Shame comes in, with as
much Force as if all the Laws of God and Man
were broken at once.</P>
<P>IT may be true, that if Man had continued in
a State of un&s;potted Innocence, un&s;haken Vir|tue
had been Part of it; that as his Soul
<PB N="3" REF="11">
had been untainted with &s;o much as a Thought
of Crime, &s;o no Covering had been wanted to
any Part of his Body, other than the Severities
of Climate might make nece&s;&s;ary; but to ju|&s;tify
what has been done &s;ince, that I may take
Notice of the Manner, and put you in Mind
of the Authority of it too, we may ob&s;erve
that as his Guilt made him <HI>naked,</HI> GOD him|&s;elf
covered him with his own Hand, <HI>Gen.</HI> iii.
21. it is &s;aid po&s;itively, that <HI>GOD</HI> clothed them
with the Skins (we &s;uppo&s;e) of Bea&s;ts: <HI>Unto
Adam al&s;o and to his Wife did the</HI> LORD GOD
<HI>make Coats of Skins, and clothed them.</HI> So &s;oon
were the Creatures dedicated to the Conveni|ence,
as well as Life of Man.</P>
<P>HENCE, tho' Nakedne&s;s in a &s;tate of Innocence
had been no Offence at that time, it is other|wi&s;e
now; and we have the Sanction of Heaven
to enforce the Decency, as we have the Force
of the Sea&s;ons to urge the Nece&s;&s;ity of Clo|thing:
It were to be wi&s;h'd we had nothing to
&s;ay of the Indecency even of the Clothing, and
how we &s;tudy to go naked in our very Clothes,
and that after GOD him&s;elf put them on to co|ver
us too. <HI>But of that by it &s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>GOD having then appointed, and Nature
compelled Mankind to &s;eek Covering, all the
Pretences for going naked on that account are
at an End; a meer Chimera, an Enthu&s;ia&s;tick
Dream, &s;eldom attempted but by a Sect of
Madmen, wor&s;e than Lunatick, who, heated
with a <HI>religious Phrenzy,</HI> (the wor&s;t of all Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions)
pretend to Nakedne&s;s as the Effect of
their Innocence, at the &s;ame Time making it a
Skreen to all Manner of Lewdne&s;s and Debau|chery.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="12">
NATURE and Religion having thus introduc'd
Decency, the &s;trict and religious regard paid to
that Decency is become a <HI>Virtue;</HI> e&s;&s;ential Vir|tue,
and is &s;o in all the requi&s;ite Parts of <HI>Vir|tue;</HI>
I mean, tho&s;e which are under&s;tood as com|manded
by the <HI>Laws</HI> of <HI>GOD,</HI> or by the <HI>Laws
of NATURE;</HI> and this is MODESTY, as
it is the Subject of our pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>WE &s;ay that Mode&s;ty is the guard of Virtue;
and in &s;ome re&s;pects it is &s;o; and were Mode&s;ty
univer&s;al, Virtue would need no other Defence.
But as the World now &s;tands, &s;he is fain to fly
to other Succours, &s;uch as Laws of Men, the
Command of Religion, the Power of Rea&s;on,
and, at la&s;t, the Protection of Governours; &s;o
hard is &s;he pur&s;ued by Vice and the degenerate
Pa&s;&s;ions of Men.</P>
<P>MODESTY then, as I am to under&s;tand it
here, and to di&s;cour&s;e about it, is nothing but a
&s;trict regard to Decency, as Decency is a &s;trict
regard to Virtue, and Virtue is a &s;trict regard
to Religion; indeed they &s;eem all, in &s;ome
Sen&s;e, to be &s;ynonimous, and to mean the &s;ame
thing. It is true, Honour and Virtue may
(&s;peaking &s;trictly) be &s;aid in &s;ome Ca&s;es to be
pre&s;erved, though Decency is not &s;o much, or
equally regarded: But let all that plead the
po&s;&s;ibility of that Di&s;tinction <HI>know,</HI> that how|ever
po&s;&s;ible it may be, it is &s;o far from being
probable (that where Decency is given up Ho|nour
&s;hould or can be pre&s;erved) that they will
find it very hard to have it be believed; as they
that give up their Mode&s;ty cannot be &s;aid to
pre&s;erve Decency, &s;o they that give up Decency
will be hardly believed to pre&s;erve their Vir|tue.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="13">
HENCE <HI>Mode&s;ty</HI> is become a <HI>Virtue</HI> in it &s;elf,
and, if it be not literally and expre&s;sly all that
is under&s;tood by the Word Virtue, 'tis Virtue's
compleat Repre&s;entative, its true Image, and
they are as in&s;eparable as the Gold and the
Gli&s;tering.</P>
<P>THE Object of Mode&s;ty re&s;pects three
Things.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Mode&s;ty in Di&s;cour&s;e.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Mode&s;ty in Behaviour.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Mode&s;ty in regard to Sexes.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>1. BY <HI>Mode&s;ty in Di&s;cour&s;e</HI> I think I mu&s;t of
Nece&s;&s;ity be under&s;tood, a Decency of Expre&s;|&s;ion;
particularly, as our Di&s;cour&s;e relates to A|ctions
or Things (whether nece&s;&s;ary or acciden|tal)
that are and ought to be Matters of Secre&s;y,
Things which are to be &s;poken of with re&s;erve,
and in Terms that may give no offence to the
cha&s;te Ears and Minds of others, and yet per|haps
are of Nece&s;&s;ity to be &s;poken to. Indeed
&s;uch Things, with re&s;pect to Decency, ought
never to be &s;poken of at all, but when Nece&s;|&s;ity
urges; and it were to be wi&s;hed, that in a
Chri&s;tian and Mode&s;t Nation, where the Laws
of Decency are expre&s;sly admitted as Rules of
Life, all immode&s;t Di&s;cour&s;es were decry'd by
univer&s;al Cu&s;tom; and e&s;pecially that Printing
and Publi&s;hing &s;uch Things as are not to be
read with the like Decency, were effectually
&s;uppre&s;s'd. But as I have made that Subject a
Part of this Work, I &s;ay no more of it here.</P>
<P>2. BY <HI>Mode&s;ty in Behaviour,</HI> I under&s;tand that
which we call Decorum, Di&s;tance and Defe|rence
in Conver&s;ation, chiefly as it re&s;pects
the Di&s;tinction of Qualities in the Per&s;ons
<PB N="6" REF="14">
conver&s;ing; but that Part is not at all con|cerned
in this Di&s;cour&s;e, our pre&s;ent De&s;ign
looking quite another way.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t of the&s;e, (<HI>viz.</HI>) <HI>Mode&s;ty with re&s;pect
to Sexes,</HI> is the Subject intended in this Tract,
e&s;pecially as it is confined to this one Branch of
it, namely, the Conjugal Part of Life; the Inter|cour&s;e
between the Sexes, or the freedom of con|ver&s;ing
between a Man and his Wife; in which
many think all the Rules and Laws of Mode&s;ty
are fini&s;hed and at an end; a Mi&s;take &s;o gro&s;s,
&s;o full of fatal Mi&s;chiefs to the Publick Vir|tue,
and to the intent and meaning of Decency
in general, that it is much in a Nation &s;o every
way Virtuous as this, and where the Rules of
Virtue are enforced by whole&s;ome Laws, &s;uch a
corrupt Notion &s;hould &s;pread &s;o far, and &s;o
many Ab&s;urdities break out into Practice upon
that Subject.</P>
<P>THE Notion is, that there is no more &s;uch a
Thing as <HI>Mode&s;ty</HI> to be named between a Man
and his Wife; that as they are but one Fle&s;h,
and indeed but one Body, there's no Nakedne&s;s
between them: That were they alone Covering
would be not only needle&s;s but Non&s;ence, if
the Climate did not require it; that nothing
can be indecent, nothing improper; that there's
no Re&s;traint, and that no Law can be broken
by them, but every thing is Hand&s;ome, every
thing Hone&s;t, and every thing Mode&s;t; that
'tis a full An&s;wer to all Reproach in any Ca&s;e
that may be charg'd, to &s;ay it was my own Wife;
or it was none but my own Husband; this is
made the Covering to all manner of &s;urfeiting
Indecencies and Exce&s;&s;es; of which I am to
&s;peak at large in their Order.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="15">
IT is high time to combat this Error of Life,
and the more, becau&s;e it is grown up to a
heighth not only &s;candalous, but criminal and
offen&s;ive, and, in &s;ome things, unnatural; and
&s;till the more, becau&s;e 'tis a Mi&s;take that is
encrea&s;ing, and 'tis fear'd may go higher, till
at la&s;t it may break out into yet greater Abo|minations.</P>
<P>THE
Difficulty before me is, to know how to
reprove with Decency offences again&s;t Decency;
how to expo&s;e Mode&s;tly Things which 'tis hard|ly
Mode&s;t &s;o much as to mention, and which
mu&s;t require abundance of clean Linnen to
wrap them up in; how to &s;peak of nau&s;eous
and offen&s;ive Things, in Terms which &s;hall not
give offence, and &s;courge immode&s;t Actions with
an unblameable Mode&s;ty; that is, without run|ning
out into Expre&s;&s;ions which &s;hall offend the
mode&s;t Ears of tho&s;e that read them; this, I
&s;ay, is the only Difficulty.</P>
<P>I am in&s;ulted already on this Head by the
rude and &s;elf-guilty World; my very Title
and the bare adverti&s;ing my Book, <HI>they &s;ay,</HI> is a
Breach upon Mode&s;ty, and it offends their Ears
even before it is publi&s;hed. They not only tell
me it will be an Ob&s;cene and immode&s;t Book,
but that it is impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e:
They &s;ay, I may pretend to as much re&s;erved|ne&s;s
and darkne&s;s of Expre&s;&s;ion as I plea&s;e, and
may skulk behind a Croud, or indeed a Cloud
of Words; but my meaning will be reach'd,
and the lewd Age will make plain <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> of
it; nay, that I &s;hall make plain <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> of it my
&s;elf, before I have gone half thro' the Work.</P>
<P>OTHERS, armed with the &s;ame ill Nature,
have their Tongues poi&s;oned with another kind
of Venom, and they tell me it is an immode&s;t
<PB N="8" REF="16">
Subject; that as it cannot be handled decently,
and cannot be di&s;cours'd of mode&s;tly, &s;o it is
not intended to be &s;o, but that 'tis a meer Bait
to the Curio&s;ity of that Part of the reading
World, who&s;e Vices are prompted as much by a
pretended reproving them as by the plaine&s;t
Expre&s;&s;ions: That it forms the &s;ame Ideas in their
Minds, and they receive the Notions of Vice
in as lively a form by the very Methods tak|en
to expo&s;e and condemn the Facts, as if
tho&s;e Facts were repre&s;ented to the Opticks
in all their &s;hamele&s;s Nudities, with the
mo&s;t vitious and corrupt Dre&s;s that could be
put upon them on a Stage, or in a Ma&s;que|rade.</P>
<P>I
&s;hall an&s;wer the&s;e People be&s;t by a Silence
in my Introduction, and a &s;peaking Perfor|mance.
It is my Bu&s;ine&s;s to let them &s;ee they
are mi&s;taken, and that a truly mode&s;t De&s;ign
may be pur&s;ued with the utmo&s;t Decency, even
in treating of a Subject, in which all the vile&s;t
Breaches made upon Decency by a wicked
and hitherto unreproved Behaviour are to be
cen&s;ured and expo&s;ed: As to a vicious Mind
forming corrupt Ideas from the mo&s;t mode&s;t
Expre&s;&s;ions, I have only this to &s;ay; The
Crime of that Part is wholly their own, I am
no way concerned in it: The healing fructifying
Dews, and the gentle &s;weet refre&s;hing Showers,
which are God's Ble&s;&s;ing upon the Earth, when
they fall into the Sea are all turned Salt as the

which the Sea-Water is &s;o full of. The &s;ame
warm cheri&s;hing Beams of the Sun which rai&s;e
tho&s;e &s;weet Dews from the Earth, &s;hining upon
the &s;tagnate Waters of an unwhol&s;ome Lake or
Mar&s;h, or upon a corrupted Jakes or Dunghill,
<PB N="9" REF="17">
exhale noxious Vapours and Poi&s;ons, which
infect the Air, breeding Contagion and Di&s;|ea&s;es
in tho&s;e that breathe in it. But the Fault
is not in the Showers of refre&s;hing Rain, or in
the whole&s;ome Beams of the Sun, but in the
Salt, and in the Filth and Corruption of the
Places where they fall. And thus it &s;hall be
here; Words mode&s;tly expre&s;&s;ed can give no
immode&s;t Ideas, where the Minds of tho&s;e
that read are cha&s;te and uncorrupted. But if a
vicious Mind hears the Vice reproved, and
forms plea&s;ing Ideas of the Crime, without tak|ing
notice of the ju&s;t Reproof, the fault is in
the Depravity of the Mind, not in the needful
and ju&s;t Reprover. I &s;hall therefore take no no|tice
of that Sugge&s;tion, as what I think does
not de&s;erve the lea&s;t Regard, but go on to a
ju&s;t Cen&s;ure of the Crime, in &s;uch a manner, as,
I hope, &s;hall neither le&s;&s;en the Reproof, or ex|po&s;e
the Reprover.</P>
<P>IN order to this, I may indeed lie under &s;ome
Re&s;traints, be confined to a narrow Compa&s;s of
Words, and the Story may want in &s;ome Places
the Illu&s;tration of appo&s;ite Similies, u&s;eful Ar|guments,
and, above all, of flagrant Examples, to
&s;et off and &s;et home the Arguments that are
made u&s;e of; and this, to the great Lo&s;s of the
Author, in taking away tho&s;e Ornaments of his
Di&s;cour&s;e; but where it cannot be otherwi&s;e
the Reader mu&s;t be content to abate it.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, I pretend to &s;ay, you will not find
it a dry, a dull, or a barren Subject, for all that;
and though &s;omething may be lo&s;t, and much
left out, to pre&s;erve the Rules of Mode&s;ty,
which I could not reprove the Breaches of with
Ju&s;tice, if the Work was Criminal it &s;elf, yet
I doubt not to find you Subject of Diver&s;ion
<PB N="10" REF="18">
enough, mixed with the Gravity of the Story,
&s;o as, I hope, not to tire you with the Reading;
at the &s;ame time pre&s;erving the Cha&s;tity
of the Subject, the Authority of a Reprover,
and binding my &s;elf down with all po&s;&s;i|ble
Severity to the Laws of Decency, Mo|de&s;ty
and Virtue, which I write in the De|fence
of.</P>
<P>BUT now, while I am making the&s;e Provi|&s;o's,
pray let me be under&s;tood too with that
ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary Liberty of Speech which
&s;hall render my Di&s;cour&s;e intelligible. I am
neither going to write in an unknown Tongue,
nor in an unintelligible Stile; I am to &s;peak
&s;o as to be under&s;tood, and I will not doubt
but I &s;hall be under&s;tood; and tho&s;e who&s;e vi|tious
Appetites are under Government, &s;o as to
give them leave to reli&s;h decent Reproof for
indecent Things, may under&s;tand me without
large Explications, e&s;pecially on Occa&s;ions where
they know the Ca&s;es will not bear it.</P>
<P>THE Scripture is the Pattern of Decency,
and, (as the learned Annotator Mr. <HI>Pool,</HI> in his
<HI>Synop&s;is Criticorum,</HI> and in his Annotations al&s;o
ob&s;erves) &s;peaks of all the Indecencies of Men
with the utmo&s;t Mode&s;ty; yet neither does the
Scripture forbear to command Virtue, gives
Laws and Rules of Cha&s;tity and mode&s;t Beha|viour,
and that in very many Places, and on
all needful Occa&s;ions: Nor does the Scripture
fail to reprove the Breach of tho&s;e Laws in
the mo&s;t vehement manner, condemning the
Facts, and cen&s;uring and judging the guilty
Per&s;ons with the utmo&s;t Rigour and Severity,
as I &s;hall on many Occa&s;ions be led to ob&s;erve
as I go on. Let none therefore flatter them|&s;elves
that their Crimes &s;hall avoid the La&s;h
<PB N="11" REF="19">
of a ju&s;t Satyr in this Work, for want of Ex|pre&s;&s;ions
&s;uited to the Nature of the Reproof,
and the Vilene&s;s of the Offence. We &s;hall find
Words to expo&s;e them, without giving a Blow
to Decency in the Reproof; we &s;hall find Ways
and Means to dre&s;s up &s;urfeiting Crimes in
&s;oftening Language; &s;o that none but the
Guilty need to blu&s;h, none but the Criminals
be offended.</P>
<P>BUT the Crime mu&s;t be reproved; there's a
Nece&s;&s;ity for the Reproof as there is a Nece&s;&s;ity
of a Cure in a violent Di&s;temper. Do we
reckon it a Breach of Mode&s;ty for the Body to
be expo&s;ed in Anatomies, and publi&s;hed with
learned Lectures on every Part by the Anato|mi&s;ts?
Are not the vile&s;t and mo&s;t unnatural
of all Crimes nece&s;&s;arily brought before Courts
of Ju&s;tice, that the Criminals may be puni&s;hed
as they de&s;erve? And though it may be true,
that &s;ometimes judicial Proceedings are not ma|naged
with &s;uch Decency in tho&s;e Ca&s;es as
others think they might, and which, however,
I allow to be &s;ometimes unavoidable; ye$ not|with&s;tanding
all that can be pretended of Im|mode&s;ty
in tho&s;e Proceedings, the Puni&s;hment
of the Criminal, or his being &s;entenced mu&s;t not
be omitted, for the pre&s;erving the Mode&s;ty of
the Trial; an Offender would come well off in
many Offences, be&s;ides this I am treating of,
if he mu&s;t not be brought to Ju&s;tice, becau&s;e
the very mention of his Crime would put
criminal Ideas into the minds of tho&s;e that
hear of it.</P>
<P>LET it &s;uffice then in the Ca&s;e before us; I
am entring upon a ju&s;t and needful Cen&s;ure of
prepo&s;terous and immode&s;t Actions; I &s;hall per|form
it in as decent and re&s;erved Terms as I am
<PB N="12" REF="20">
able to do, and as a Man meaning to correct,
not encourage, Vice is able to do. If a lewd
Fancy will entertain it &s;elf with the meer Ideas
of Crime, where it is only with the utmo&s;t Seve|rity
condemned, Be the Crime to the Criminal,
I &s;ee no rea&s;on to be afraid of doing Ju&s;tice on
that Account. A Man is to be executed for
Sodomy; Nature and the Laws of God require
it; Mu&s;t not the Criminal die becau&s;e all that
&s;ee or hear of it mu&s;t immediately form Ideas
of the Crime in their Thoughts, nay, and per|haps
may think criminally of it? This would
give a loo&s;e to Wickedne&s;s indeed, and Men
might Sin with mo&s;t Freedom where their
Crimes were too vile to be puni&s;hed, becau&s;e
they were too gro&s;s to be named.</P>
<L>So when a Cloud its ha&s;ty Show'rs &s;ends down,</L>
<L>They're meant to fructify and not to drown;</L>
<L>And in a Torrent if a Drunkard &s;ink,</L>
<L>'Tis not the Flood that drowns him but the Drink.</L>

<P>BESIDES, it wou'd be a light e&s;cape; and &s;ome

way over the Author, if they could be &s;atisfied
that they had &s;inned in a manner &s;o gro&s;s that

<P>BUT to pa&s;s the&s;e and &s;ome more, for in this
Age of prepo&s;terous Crime we &s;hould never
find our Way out, &s;hould we enter into the
Labyrinth of Characters, and bring on Regi|ments
of Examples. Our pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s is
with the Offence not with the Offenders, with
the Crimes not the Criminals; if a ju&s;t Satyr on
the wicked Part will not reclaim us, I doubt the
Li&s;t of the Guilty of both Sexes, though it
would indeed be as numerous as our City train'd
Bands; would be as u&s;ele&s;s a Mu&s;ter as that at
the Artillery Ground, and find as little Refor|mation
among them.</P>
<P>AS it is in ordinary Crimes, that Men Sin on
becau&s;e they &s;corn and are a&s;hamed to Repent,
&s;o in the Ca&s;e before me, when they are
launched into the mo&s;t flagrant of all Crimes,
things &s;o odious that 'tis offen&s;ive to mode&s;t
Ears &s;o much as to hear of them, and difficult
<PB N="15" REF="23">
to a mode&s;t Pen &s;o much as to write of them;
they take hold of the helli&s;h Advantage, and
make the greatne&s;s, the &s;uperlative Blackne&s;s of
their Offences be their Protection in the com|mitting
them; as if they were out of the reach
of Reproof, becau&s;e no mode&s;t Pen can dip
in the Dirt, or rake in the Dunghil of their
Vices, without being &s;ullied and daub'd by
them; that it would be &s;candalous for any mo|de&s;t
Man &s;o much as to mention what they do
not think it &s;candalous to do. Thus the har|dened
and fearle&s;s <HI>A</HI>&mdash;<HI>C</HI>&mdash;, who
defies God and Man, laughs at Reproach, and
threatens every Reprover, impudently &s;aid to
his Pari&s;h Mini&s;ter that mode&s;tly &s;poke of his
Crimes, &startq;<HI>You may talk to me here, Doctor,</HI> at
home, <HI>but you dare not &s;peak a Word of it in
the Pulpit; I am out of your reach there; Why,
all the Women would run out of the Church, and
they'd throw Stones at you as you go along the
Street if you did but mention it.&endq;</HI></P>
<P>HAPPY Criminal! that hugs him&s;elf in being
too Vile to be reproved, or &s;o much as mode&s;t|ly
mentioned; that his Crimes cannot be ex|po&s;ed
becau&s;e mode&s;t Ears cannot bear to
hear them &s;poken of. Let the Offender, who
is fam'd for being Revengeful, and who is not
&s;o far off as not to hear of it, re&s;ent it if he
thinks fit: I am told he will &s;oon hear more of
it, where it may be &s;poken of without fear
of his Anger.</P>
<P>THIS very Ca&s;e runs parallel with what I
am now engaged in; but the Age &s;hall &s;ee the
Effect &s;hall not an&s;wer their End. Shall it be
Criminal to reprove the Offence which they
think it is not Criminal to commit? Mu&s;t we
Blu&s;h to &s;peak of what they will not Blu&s;h to
<PB N="16" REF="24">
do? And mu&s;t the mo&s;t dete&s;table Things go on
in practice, becau&s;e we dare not go on to cry
them down? God forbid we &s;hould by Silence
&s;eem to approve that Wickedne&s;s, while that Si|lence
is occa&s;ioned only becau&s;e the Wickedne&s;s
is too gro&s;s to be reproved.</P>
<P>SURE our Language is not &s;o barren of Words
as that we cannot find out proper Expre&s;&s;ions
to reprehend an impudent Generation, with|out
Breach of Decency in the Diction; or
that immode&s;t Actions may not be mode&s;tly
expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>IF corrupt Imaginations will ri&s;e up, and
Men will plea&s;e them&s;elves with the Difficulty
I am put to for Words; if they will turn my mo&s;t
re&s;erved Terms into lewd and vitious Ideas, and
debauch their Thoughts while I expo&s;e their
Debaucheries, let them go on their own Way;
let them think as wickedly as they plea&s;e, they
&s;hall owe it to them&s;elves, not to me; both
the Fire and the Tinder are all their own.
Here &s;hall be no Materials to work upon, no
Combu&s;tibles to kindle, but what they bring
with them.</P>
<P>BUT the Work mu&s;t be done in &s;pite of the
Difficulty. Shall they watch for a &s;lip of my
Pen, and take Advantage, if po&s;&s;ible, from any
mi&s;placed Word, to reprove me of Indecency
in the nece&s;&s;ary Work of reproving their
&s;hamele&s;s Immode&s;ty? Mu&s;t I be a&s;hamed to
expo&s;e the Crime which they are not a&s;hamed
to be guilty of, and blu&s;h to mention the
Things they boa&s;t of Doing? The Truth is, I
know not why I &s;hould not freely name the
Men, who in the open Coffee-hou&s;es, and in
their common wicked Di&s;cour&s;es, publickly
brag of the mo&s;t immode&s;t and &s;hamele&s;s Be|haviour,
<PB N="17" REF="25">
and vilely name them&s;elves to be
guilty of it, make &s;port of the Crimes, and
value them&s;elves in being the Criminals; but
it &s;hall not be long before I may &s;peak of it
much plainer.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, as the Offence is flagrant, is grown
&s;candalous and notorious, and that we find the
Age ripening up by it to the highe&s;t and mo&s;t
unnatural of all Crimes, to the &s;hame of Soci|ety,
and to the &s;candal even of the Prote&s;tant
Profe&s;&s;ion; I have undertaken to begin the War
again&s;t it as a Vice, and hope to make good
the Charge, though I know I do make the At|tempt
at the ri&s;que of all that a mode&s;t Writer
has to hazard.</P>
<P>HE that undertakes a Satyr again&s;t an uni|ver&s;al
Cu&s;tom, &s;hall be &s;ure to rai&s;e upon him|&s;elf
an univer&s;al Clamour; my Lord <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI>
is plain in that Ca&s;e:
<Q><L>&startq;Nor &s;hall weak Truth your Reputation &s;ave,</L>
<L>The Knaves will all agree to call you Knave.&endq;</L></Q></P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be acknowledged the Age is ripened
up in Crime to a dreadful heighth, and it is
not a light, a gentle Touch, that will bring
them to blu&s;h. The Learned and Reverend Mi|ni&s;ters,
the Good, the Pious, who would re|prove
them, are forced to content them&s;elves to
&s;it &s;till, and pray for them; and, as the Scripture
&s;ays, <HI>to mourn in Secret for their Abominations;</HI>
they cannot foul their &s;olemn Di&s;cour&s;es with
the Crimes which they have to Combat with;
the Pulpit is &s;acred to the venerable Office of a
Preacher of GOD's Word; and the Gravity
of the Place, a decent Regard to the Work,
and e&s;pecially to the A&s;&s;embly, forbids them pol|luting
<PB N="18" REF="26">
their Mouths with the filthy Behaviour
of tho&s;e they &s;ee Cau&s;e to reprove: And this
makes many a lewd and vitious Wretch go
unexpo&s;ed, at lea&s;t as he de&s;erves; and many a
&s;candalous Crime, as well as the rich and pow|erful
Criminals, go unreproved.</P>
<P>THE auxiliary Pre&s;s therefore mu&s;t come in
to &s;upply the deficiency; they may read, I
hope, what they could not hear: Nor am I
afraid of the Faces of Men, that, eminent in
Wickedne&s;s, flagrant in Lewdne&s;s, and abomi|nable
in Tongue, as well as Practice, the famous
and infamous in the wor&s;t of Vices, Sir&mdash;
<HI>P</HI>&mdash;, &s;hall here &s;ee him&s;elf marked out
for his odious Behaviour, in defiance of his
Quality or Power. He who by Office and
Authority puni&s;hes every Day le&s;s Crimes
than he commits, who &s;ins out of the reach of
Reproof from the Pulpit, becau&s;e too vile (as
well as too powerful) to be &s;poken of by a mo|de&s;t
Divine, who perhaps thinks it his Duty
rather to Pray for him, which he laughs at,
than to Reprove him, which he would &s;torm
and &s;wear at; I &s;ay, he &s;hall find what was &s;aid
in another Ca&s;e:
<Q><L>The Pre&s;s may reach him, who the Pulpit &s;corns,</L>
<L>And he who&s;e flagrant Vice the B&mdash;adorns:</L>
<L>The fearle&s;s Satyr &s;hall to Rage give vent,</L>
<L>And teach him how to Blu&s;h, tho' not Repent.</L></Q></P>
<P>IN &s;hort, 'tis a &s;trange World! and we are
grown up to a &s;trange heighth in our Notions
of Things! we have brought our &s;elves to a Con|dition
very particular to the Day, and &s;ingular

Criminals have managed them&s;elves &s;o artfully,

of Reputation, than the Innocent may reprove
them: For Example,</P>
<P>THE Crime is now le&s;s Scandal than Repen|tance,
and, as the Proverb &s;ays, 'tis a &s;hame to
Steal, but 'tis a double &s;hame to carry Home

&s;hame to Repent; nay, we go beyond all that,
'tis no &s;hame to be Wicked, but to Whine and
Repent is intolerable; and, as the late Colonel

it might be a Fault to Whore, and Drink, and
Swear, and &s;ome wor&s;e Sins of his, which he

he,</HI> (repeating the Words) nothing of a Gentle|man

too, and ought to be pre&s;erved &s;acred, not be
debauched with criminal Exce&s;&s;es of any kind;
much le&s;s &s;hould it be made a cover and skreen for
tho&s;e matrimonial Intemperances which I now
&s;peak of, and which I &s;hall prove to be not on|ly
&s;candalous to, but unworthy of Matrimony,
as a &s;acred &s;tate of Life.</P>
<P>AS it is GOD's Ordinance, and an holy Or|dinance,
&s;o 'tis an honourable State; the Apo|&s;tle
&s;ays, <HI>Marriage is honourable, Heb.</HI> xiii. 4.
But then you are to ob&s;erve al&s;o, that it is
immediately added, and the <HI>Bed undefiled.</HI> Now
this nice Term of the Bed undefiled, requires
&s;ome Explanation, and in that perhaps we may
differ. They that think the Marriage-Bed can|not
be defiled but by <HI>Adultery,</HI> will greatly dif|fer
from me; and 'tis my Bu&s;ine&s;s to prove they
are mi&s;taken, which, if I do not, I do no|thing.</P>
<P>BUT,
that I may do it with the more clear|ne&s;s,
and leave no Room for Di&s;pute, I there|fore
&s;et apart this fir&s;t Chapter to con&s;ider Ma|trimony
in general, what it is, how we ought
to under&s;tand it, and what the End and De&s;ign
of GOD's Appointment in it was, and &s;till is;
and by this, I think, I may make Way for a
more exact Ob&s;ervation of tho&s;e Duties which
<PB N="22" REF="30">
the matrimonial Vow is &s;aid to bind us to, and
expo&s;e the &s;candalous Mi&s;takes of tho&s;e who
make it a Cloke to all Licentiou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as our Mother <HI>EVE</HI> was fir&s;t form'd,
had ju&s;t found her &s;elf in Being, and though
&s;he had &s;een nothing about her, yet had a Soul
as capacious of Knowledge as the Man &s;he was
made for. The Text &s;ays, GOD <HI>brought her to
the Man,</HI> Gen. ii. 22. that is, in &s;hort, <HI>GOD mar|ried
them. Adam</HI> him&s;elf expre&s;&s;es it, cap. iii.
12. <HI>The Woman whom thou gave&s;t me. N. B.</HI> GOD
gave the Bride.</P>
<P>HENCE I ob&s;erve by the way, tho' with all
po&s;&s;ible Brevity, that they are certainly wrong
who challenge the Clergy for engro&s;&s;ing the
Office of Marrying, as if it did not belong to
them, but was a meer Civil Contract, and
therefore was no Perqui&s;ite of the Church, but
the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Magi&s;trate.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, '<HI>tis a Mi&s;take;</HI> for as it was in&s;tituted
immediately from the divine Authority, &s;o it was
&s;olemnized by him who having alone In&s;tituted
it, had a Right to perform the Ceremony; for
this Rea&s;on it is called <HI>GOD's holy Ordinance;</HI>
and though I do not think it ought to be $word$
a <HI>Sacrament,</HI> yet without doubt GOD him&s;elf
put a &s;acred Character upon it as he honoured
$span$
<PB N="23" REF="31">
Authority. The Ceremony then being truly
Religious, and an Ordinance of GOD, it goes
with GOD's other Ordinances, away to the
Prie&s;t, who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s it is to exerci&s;e all reli|gious
Offices; and this among the re&s;t.</P>
<P>ALSO here, if you will allow me to Preach,
it &s;hall be again&s;t the Plurality of Wives:
From this Pattern in Paradi&s;e <HI>Poligamy</HI> &s;eems to
be utterly condemned; and though in the Times
of After-Ignorance many Things were prac|ti&s;ed,
which, as the Text &s;ays, <HI>GOD winked at,</HI>
yet in the Beginning it was not &s;o; and we may
as well Argue for marrying two Si&s;ters, as <HI>Ja|cob,</HI>
and perhaps &s;everal others did, till it was
e&s;pecially prohibited, as for marrying many
Wives at once, which 'tis evident our Saviour
forbids, and the Argument again&s;t them are
alike, as I &s;aid above, (<HI>viz.</HI>) <HI>That in the Begin|ning
it was not &s;o.</HI></P>
<P>I know 'tis alledged, that the encrea&s;e of
Mankind, in tho&s;e early Ages of Time, made
it nece&s;&s;ary; but might it not be much more a
Rea&s;on in <HI>Adam</HI>'s Ca&s;e when he was alone?
And why did not GOD, for the immediate
Propagation of the kind, and encrea&s;e of the
World, make his Rib into half a dozen Wives
for <HI>Adam,</HI> or as many as he had pleas'd.</P>
<P>BUT 'tis evident, one Wife to one Husband
was thought be&s;t by his Maker, who knew
what was be&s;t, and mo&s;t calculated for his tem|poral
Felicity; as to the encrea&s;e of People,
'twas evident the Race &s;oon multiplied; and,
after the Interruption of the fir&s;t Growth, and
the Di&s;a&s;ter of <HI>Abel</HI>'s Death, the long Life of
the Antediluvians al&s;o con&s;idered, the Numbers
of People &s;oon encrea&s;ed, and that in a prodigious
manner; for, if you will believe the learned

Author of the <HI>Theory of the Earth,</HI> 'tis proba|ble
there were much greater Numbers of People
alive at the Deluge than ever were in the
World at any one time &s;ince, or than are now;
tho' the World is thought to be more populous
now than ever it has been &s;ince the Deluge.</P>
<P>THE Argument for the encrea&s;e of People
could not be greater &s;ince, than it was in Para|di&s;e;
and had GOD approved of it, or thought
it rea&s;onable, he would certainly have given
<HI>Adam</HI> more Wives than one at fir&s;t. Be&s;ides,
one Wife was given him as a <HI>Help meet;</HI> by
which it is evident the Original under&s;tands it
a Help &s;ufficient to him, intimating, that they
were in every Thing &s;ufficient to one another;
and not to enter into that Part of it which re|&s;pect
their Sexes, which my lewder Readers will
perhaps look for; 'Tis evident, that a &s;ingle
handed Matrimony is many Ways adapted to
the Felicity of human Life more than a &s;tate
of Poligamy; the Effect of a Plurality of
Wives having always been Family-Strife, En|vying,
and Quarrelling, between the Women
e&s;pecially, no Part of which could much add
to the Felicity of the Husband, and often did
embark the Husband in the Breach, as in the
Examples of <HI>Sarah</HI> and <HI>Hagar, Leah</HI> and <HI>Rachel,
Hannah</HI> and <HI>Penninah,</HI> and many others.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, we &s;ee the mo&s;t eminent
of the Patriarchs had but one Wife, at lea&s;t we
read of no more; even <HI>Abraham,</HI> except in the
Ca&s;e of <HI>Hagar,</HI> who was but a Concubine at
mo&s;t, had but one Wife at a Time; <HI>I&s;aac</HI> had
never any but <HI>Rebecca, Jo&s;eph, Mo&s;es, Aaron,</HI>
and &s;everal others; the gro&s;&s;er U&s;e of Wo|men
came in with <HI>David,</HI> as the &s;etting up a
Seraglio of Whores did with King <HI>Solomon;</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="37">
but, to repeat our Saviour's Words again, in
the Beginning it was not &s;o.</P>
<P>BUT I &s;hall &s;peak of that Part again in its
Cour&s;e. What I have now &s;aid is but a Di|gre&s;&s;ion
made nece&s;&s;ary as an Ob&s;ervation on
the manner of the fir&s;t Wedding; the Man and
the Woman, as I have &s;aid, were &s;ingle and &s;e|parate,
but GOD made them to a&s;&s;ociate toge|ther,
&s;o he <HI>brought the Woman to him,</HI> and gave
her to be with him, that is, as above, <HI>GOD
married them.</HI></P>
<P>GOD having thus ordained Matrimony, and
&s;olemnized the fir&s;t Nuptials in Paradi&s;e, it
cannot be denied to be, as our Office of Matri|mony
declares it, <HI>GOD's holy Ordinance.</HI> How
our Notions of it are degenerated, the Bonds of
it di&s;regarded, and the whole In&s;titution abu|&s;ed,
is the Subject of this whole Undertaking,
but e&s;pecially of this Chapter.</P>
<P>WHAT the true intent and meaning of Ma|trimony,
in its fir&s;t In&s;titution, was, and what
the Nature of that Contract points at, I &s;hall
leave in better Hands; the learned Fathers of
the Church have, in all Ages, taken Pains to
explain tho&s;e Things to you: Nor am I going
about to Preach, as a Reverend Divine lately
did to the &s;urprize of his Auditory, on <HI>Gen.</HI> iv.
ver. 1. <HI>Adam knew his Wife Eve.</HI> But there are
a great many Civil Views in the In&s;titution of
Matrimony, which the propagating of the kind
has little or no Concern in, and the Ordinance
of Matrimony &s;uffers as much by our &s;canda|lous
Notions of it, <HI>as a State of Life,</HI> as it does
in any other Part.</P>
<P>NOR is the &s;ubordination any Part of the Ca&s;e
I am upon; I am &s;o little a Friend to that
which they call Government and Obedience
<PB N="26" REF="38">
between the Man and his Wife, e&s;pecially as
&s;ome People would have it be under&s;tood, and
as the common Talk is managed when &s;uch
Things come in our way; that the Ladies will
take no Offence at me, I dare &s;ay. I don't
take the State of Matrimony to be de&s;igned as
that of Apprentices who are bound to the Family,
and that the Wife is to be us'd only as the up|per
Servant in the Hou&s;e. The great Duty be|tween
the Man and his Wife, I take to con&s;i&s;t
in that of Love, in the Government of Af|fection,
and the Obedience of a complai&s;ant,
kind, obliging Temper; the Obligation is reci|procal,
'tis drawing in an equal Yoke; Love
knows no &s;uperior or inferior, no imperious
Command on one hand, no reluctant Subjection
on the other; the End of both &s;hould be the
well-ordering their Family, the good-guiding
their Hou&s;hold and Children, educating, in|&s;tructing
and managing them with a mutual
Endeavour, and giving re&s;pectively good Ex|amples
to them, directing others in their Duty
by doing their own well, guiding them&s;elves
in every Relation, in order to the well guiding
all that are under them; filling up Life with
an equal Regard to tho&s;e above them, and
tho&s;e below them, &s;o as to be Exemplar to
all.</P>
<P>THIS is Matrimony in its ju&s;t appointed
meaning, whatever Notions our fa&s;hionable
People may have of it. What Import el&s;e can
tho&s;e Words have in them, which we find &s;o
carefully placed, and &s;o openly repeated in the
Office at the Time of Marriage, <HI>Wilt thou love
her, live with her, comfort her, honour, keep her,</HI>
and again, <HI>to love and to cheri&s;h,</HI> and afterward
'tis added, that you will do all this <HI>according
<PB N="27" REF="39">
to GOD's holy Ordinance;</HI> which, if I may ex|pound
in very plain Words, is, according to
the true intent and meaning of the fir&s;t In&s;ti|tution,
and that is in the Sen&s;e of GOD him|&s;elf,
to be a <HI>Help meet</HI> to one another.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, the Matrimonial Duty is
all reciprocal; 'tis founded in Love, 'tis per|formed
in the heighth of Affection; its mo&s;t
perfect Accompli&s;hment con&s;i&s;ts not in the
Union of the Sexes, but in the Union of the
Souls; uniting their De&s;ires, their Ends, and
con&s;equently their Endeavours, for compleating
their mutual Felicity.</P>
<P>ALL the &s;ubjection and &s;ubordination in the
World, without this mutual Affection, cannot
give one Dram of Satisfaction or Enjoyment.
How remote our Notions of Marriage in ge|neral
are to the&s;e Things, and how little the
pre&s;ent Age &s;eems to under&s;tand them, or at
lea&s;t to regard them, I need not enquire; 'tis
too vi&s;ible in almo&s;t every Family: Nor indeed
can it be otherwi&s;e, except by &s;ome rare Exam|ple
of Virtue and good Humour meeting on
both Sides, which, as Marriages are now made,
is very unlikely to happen; 'tis a Lottery of a
thou&s;and Blanks to a Prize.</P>
<P>NOT one in five hundred of tho&s;e that now
marry, really under&s;tand what they marry for;
I cannot give the detail of their general Ac|count,
and of the An&s;wers they would give to
the Que&s;tion without Blu&s;hes, not <HI>at them,</HI> but
<HI>for them;</HI> I do not mean Blu&s;hing in the Sen&s;e
that I generally take the Word in this Book,
but I mean blu&s;hing for the Folly and Igno|rance
of the People.</P>
<P>ASK the Ladies why they marry, they tell
you 'tis for a good Settlement; tho' they had
<PB N="28" REF="40">
their own Fortunes to &s;ettle on them&s;elves be|fore.
Ask the Men why they marry, it is for
the Money. How few Matches have any other
Motive except &s;uch as I mu&s;t mention here|after,
and indeed will hardly bear any mention
at all, for many known Rea&s;ons. How little is
regarded of that one e&s;&s;ential and ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary
Part of the Compo&s;ition, called Love,
without which the matrimonial State is, I
think, hardly lawful, I am &s;ure is not rational,
and, I think, can never be happy.</P>
<P>HENCE it follows, that we have &s;uch few
happy and &s;ucce&s;sful Matches. How much Ma|trimony,
how little Love; how many Coupled,
how few Join'd; in a word, how much Mar|riage,
how little Friend&s;hip. O Friend&s;hip!
thou exalted Felicity of Life, thou glorious
Incorporation of Souls, thou heavenly Image,
thou poli&s;her and fini&s;her of the brighte&s;t Part
of Mankind, how much art thou talked of,
how little under&s;tood, how much pretended to,
how little endeavoured for! Where does the
kind expecting Husband find a &s;incere Friend
in his Bo&s;om? How &s;eldom does the tender af|fectionate
Wife take a Friend into her Arms,
even though &s;he does take the Per&s;on, &s;he takes
the Man without the Husband, and the Hu&s;|band
without the Friend? Not Virtue, not
Fidelity to the Marriage Bed, not Con&s;cience
of the Conjugal Duty, not Religion, will do
it; <HI>no not RELIGION!</HI> How many Hus|bands
and Wives will go to Heaven from the
Arms of the Wives and Husbands they had no
Friend&s;hip for?</P>
<P>HOW mi&s;erably do the Pious and the Devout,
the Religious and the Con&s;ciencious live toge|ther!
the Husbands here, the Wives there, by
<PB N="29" REF="41">
jarring Tempers, di&s;cording Affections, and, in
&s;hort, meer want of Love and Friend&s;hip, grow
&s;candals to the marry'd Life, and &s;et them&s;elves
up for Beacons and Light-hou&s;es, to warn the
wandering World, and to bid them beware how
they marry without Love, how they join Hands
and not Hearts, unite Intere&s;ts, unite Sexes,
unite Families and Relatives, and yet never
unite Hearts?</P>
<P>HOW is Matrimony abu&s;ed in all the&s;e Ca&s;es
by almo&s;t all Sorts of People, who carrying a
Face of Civility and Union in the married Life,
and who, in view of the World, pa&s;s for &s;ober,
mode&s;t, grave, religious, and all that Virtue
and Hone&s;ty call for among Chri&s;tians; and
yet trace them into their Hou&s;es and Families,
their Conver&s;ation is gro&s;s, and, in a manner
debauched with undecent Language, their Way
of living all Luxury and Sloth, their Marriage
Covenants broken by Strife and Contention;
in a word, their Hou&s;es a <HI>Bedlam,</HI> and their
Marriage Bed a Scene of Lewdne&s;s and Exce&s;&s;es
not to be named.</P>
<P>IS this living together after GOD's holy Or|dinance?
Is this making the Marriage Bed a
Bed undefiled? Will they pretend there is no|thing
defiles the Marriage Bed but Whoredom,
and for&s;aking the Marriage Covenant. Let not
that Mi&s;take be their Protection in the Breach
of the Laws of Nature, and de&s;pi&s;ing all the
limitations of Decency and Mode&s;ty; there
are Laws and Limits plac'd by Nature, nay,
let me &s;ay, by the GOD of Nature, even to the
conjugal Embraces; and a due regard is to be
had, in all Ca&s;es, to tho&s;e Laws and Limits.
If I am &s;peaking to Chri&s;tians I need not ex|plain
my &s;elf; but as I am to &s;peak to &s;ome
<PB N="30" REF="42">
People who, though the World calls them
Chri&s;tians, can hardly, without blu&s;hing, call
them&s;elves &s;o, I mu&s;t be forced to &s;peak as
plainly as the Laws of Decency will allow, in
reproving their Conduct, I refer to the Parti|culars
in the following Tract, where they who
are guilty may find Room to blu&s;h.</P>
<P>IT were to be wi&s;hed, that all People that
marry were to be ask'd before-hand if they re|ally
under&s;tood what Matrimony meant, and
what the true intent of a married Life was, as
well in its In&s;titution, as in the grand De&s;ign of
Family-Felicity; the married Couple are
young, their Blood warm; the Youth, fir'd
with the blooming Beauty of his Bride, thinks
of little all the while the <HI>Apparatus</HI> of the
Wedding is in hand, nay, perhaps all the while
he is (<HI>feigning</HI>) I &s;hould &s;ay making, Love to
her, as we weakly call his Courting her, I think
we &s;hould rather call it, all the while he is
talking in Je&s;t to her; I &s;ay, all this while he
is thinking of little but getting to Bed to her.
What engages her Thoughts I &s;ay nothing to,
for Rea&s;ons given already.</P>
<P>THUS, coming together without Thought, we
are not to wonder they go on without Conduct,
that they act a thou&s;and weak and wild Things
afterwards, &s;uch as they often live to be a&s;hamed
of, and to blu&s;h at. As they allowed them|&s;elves
to think no farther than the wedding
Week, &s;o how awkwardly do they behave when
they come to the graver Part of Life? Matri|mony
is not a Branch of Life only, but 'tis a
State, 'tis a &s;ettled E&s;tabli&s;hment of Life, and an
E&s;tabli&s;hment for a continuance at lea&s;t of the
Life of one of the two. How unhappy are tho&s;e
married People, who ra&s;hly coming together, as I
<PB N="31" REF="43">
&s;aid ju&s;t now, and perhaps with mean and un|thinking
Views, I think I may &s;ay, Views un|worthy
of the Dignity and Honour of a mar|ried
State, &s;eem &s;urpri&s;ed and di&s;appointed
when they come to enter upon the &s;ub&s;equent
more weighty and &s;olid Part of the married
Life? How often do we hear them &s;ay, If I had
known what it had been to be a Wife, if I
had known what it had been to be a Husband,
and to have the Care of a Family upon me,
and a Hou&s;e-full of Children to provide for, and
take care of, I would never have married. Some
indeed Repent upon a wor&s;e Foot. But I am
&s;peaking of it now, even where the Article of
a bad Husband or a bad Wife are not con|cerned.</P>
<P>MARRIAGE
is an <HI>honourable State</HI> or Station
of Life, but it is not a thoughtle&s;s, idle, un|employed
State, even where the Concerns of the
Family are ea&s;y, where Plenty flows, and the
World &s;miles; yet a married Life has its Cares,
its Anxieties, its Embara&s;&s;ments, which the
young Lady knew nothing of in her Father's
Hou&s;e, where &s;he liv'd without Care, without
Di&s;turbance, &s;lept without Fear, and wak'd
without Sorrows. But married, &s;he is a Mi&s;tre&s;s,
&s;he is a Mother, &s;he is a Wife, every one of
which Relations has its little <HI>addenda</HI> of Incum|cumbrance,
and perhaps of Unea&s;ine&s;s too, be
her Circum&s;tances as good otherwi&s;e as &s;he can
or would &s;uppo&s;e them to be.</P>
<P>WE have an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;aying, they that marry
in ha&s;te repent at lei&s;ure. Now though my
De&s;ign is not to run down the married State,
and rai&s;e frightful Ideas in the Minds of tho&s;e
that are to enter into it, &s;o as to prevent their
marrying; yet, I hope, I may hint to them,
<PB N="32" REF="44">
that they &s;hould look before they take this
Leap in the Dark, that they &s;hould con&s;ider all
the Circum&s;tances that are before them, that
they may have no Rea&s;on to repent when they
&s;hall be &s;ure to have no Room for it.</P>
<P>NOW, it is not the Matrimony, but the abu&s;e
of Matrimony, which is our pre&s;ent Subject,
nor let the Ladies be offended, as if I was per|&s;wading
Folks not to marry at all; it is not
refu&s;ing Matrimony that I per&s;uade to in order
to prevent tho&s;e Abu&s;es, but a con&s;idering and
weighing the Circum&s;tances of Matrimony be|fore
it is con&s;ummated. I agree with the Maids
Catechi&s;e, where the fir&s;t Que&s;tion is, <HI>What is
the chief End of a Maid?</HI> and the An&s;wer is,
<HI>To be married.</HI> But I am Arguing to remove
the Occa&s;ion of tho&s;e Abu&s;es which make the
Matrimony ruinous, and a Di&s;a&s;ter both to the
Man and to the Maid.</P>
<P>THIS would &s;ecure the Affection of the Par|ties
before they marry; they would be united
before they were joined, they would be mar|ried
even before they were wedded, the Love
would be po&s;&s;e&s;s'd before the Per&s;ons, and they
would have exchanged Hearts before they ex|changed
the Words of, I, <HI>N.</HI> take thee <HI>N;</HI> in
&s;hort, Matrimony without Love is the Cart be|fore
the Hor&s;e, and Love without Matrimony
is the Hor&s;e without any Cart at all.</P>
<P>MARRYING is not &s;uch a frightful Thing
that we &s;hould be terrified at the Thoughts of
it, yet it is far from being &s;uch a trifling Thing
either that we &s;hould run Headlong or Blind|fold
into it, without &s;o much as looking before
us. 'Twas a prudent Saying of a young Lady,
who wanted neither Wit or Fortune to recom|mend
her, that marrying on the Woman's Side
<PB N="33" REF="45">
was like a Hor&s;e ru&s;hing into the Battle, who
depending upon the Hand that rules him, has
no Weapon of his own, either offen&s;ive or de|fen&s;ive;
whereas, on the Man's &s;ide, like the
Soldier, he has both Armour to pre&s;erve him|&s;elf,
and Weapons to make him be fear'd by his
Adver&s;ary.</P>
<P>I know not by what degeneracy in our Man|ners,
or corruption of Principles, it is come
to pa&s;s, but 'tis too general in practice, that
Matrimony is now looked upon only as a po|litick
Opportunity to gratify a vitious Appe|tite:
The Form, how &s;acred &s;oever graver Heads
may pretend it is in its In&s;titution, is now
become our Je&s;t, and not only ridiculed and
bantered in our Di&s;cour&s;e, for that might be
born with, but 'tis become a Je&s;t in practice;
all the &s;olemn Part is dropt out of our Thoughts,
the Money and the Maidenhead is the Sub|ject
of our Meditations; not only the divine
In&s;titution is made a Stalking-hor&s;e to the bru|tal
Appetite, but indeed the be&s;t of Women are
betrayed by it into the hands of the vile&s;t of
Men, and in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t manner abus'd; nay,
which is &s;till wor&s;e, this is done with a Banter
and a Je&s;t, all the &s;acred Obligations, the in|di&s;&s;olvable
Bands of Religion and Virtue, are
trampled under foot; the mode&s;t and mo&s;t vir|tuous
Lady is impudently defloured, and the
Night's Enjoyment boa&s;ted of the next Day in
the Arms of a Strumpet; the innocent Bride
is poi&s;oned with a Di&s;ea&s;e, and the dete&s;table
Wretch is a Bridegroom, and an Adulterer, in
the fir&s;t four and twenty Hours of his Engage|ment.</P>
<P><HI>A&mdash;B&mdash;</HI> was a Gentleman of
Figure and Fortune; in his Coach and four, and
<PB N="34" REF="46">
with a &s;uitable Equipage: He made his Addre&s;|&s;es
to a wealthy Citizen, and Propo&s;als of &s;uit|able
Settlement, for his Con&s;ent to court his
Daughter. Nothing appeared but what was fair
and honourable; he is accepted; the young
Lady, virtuous, mode&s;t, beautiful, finely bred,
in the Bloom of her Youth, Wheedled with his
Tongue, and deceived with the appearance of
a fine Gentleman, and a Lover, yields to the
Propo&s;als, and throws her &s;elf into the Arms of
the wor&s;t of Mon&s;ters.</P>
<P>THE very fir&s;t Moments of his embraces
fright her with &s;omething inexpre&s;&s;ibly nau|&s;eous
about him; yet Innocence and Virtue
had no Power to make a Judgment of Things;
but, like the cha&s;t <HI>Roman</HI> Lady, who&s;e Hu&s;|band
had a &s;tinking Breath, innocently an|&s;wered,
That &s;he thought all Men were &s;o.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, the Lady is ruined the fir&s;t Night;
the V..... boa&s;ted among his viler Com|panions,
that he had given her &s;omething that
would &s;oon di&s;po&s;e of her; and it was too true;
in le&s;s than a Month &s;he was in a Condition
not fit to be de&s;cribed, in about two more the
able&s;t Phy&s;icians &s;hook their Heads, and voted
her Incurable, in eight Months &s;he was a de|plorable
Object, and, in le&s;s than a Year, lodg'd
in her Grave; the Murtherer, for he can be no
other, putting on Black for a &s;hew; but when
charged home by the Friends of the ruin'd
Lady, an&s;wered with a kind of a laugh, that he
thought he had been cured.</P>
<P>IF this unhappy Story were a Romance, a
Fiction, contrived to illu&s;trate the Subject, I
&s;hould give it you with all its abhorred Particu|lars,
as far as decency of Language would per|mit;
that the abu&s;e of Matrimony, which is the
<PB N="35" REF="47">
Subject I am now to enter upon, may be expo|&s;ed
as it de&s;erves.</P>
<P>BUT when Facts, however flagrant, are too
near home, and the mi&s;erable Sufferers already
too much oppre&s;&s;ed with the Injury, we mu&s;t
not add to their Afflictions by too publick a u&s;e
of the Calamity to embelli&s;h our Story; the
murthered Lady re&s;ts in her Grave; we mu&s;t
leave the Offender to the &s;upreme Ju&s;tice, and
to the Reproaches of his Con&s;cience.</P>
<P>SAD Examples of conjugal Treachery might
be given of this kind; and I might make the
whole Work a Satyr upon tho&s;e, who, abu&s;ing
the Marriage Bed, have pro&s;tituted the &s;acred
In&s;titution to their Vice, and made it a cover|ing
to Crime, a &s;nare to the Per&s;on drawn into
it, and a cheat to devour their Fortunes, as well
as Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>THE Lady&mdash;, pardon my concealing
Names, is a Per&s;on of good Birth, of a Family
in good Circum&s;tances, and pa&s;s'd with all that
knew her for a Woman of Virtue. Her mode&s;t
behaviour gave &s;uch a Credit to her, and e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
her Character &s;o well, that it would
have looked like Malice, and been received in
all Company with a general di&s;gu&s;t, &s;o much
as to have drop'd a Word that look'd like De|traction,
or in the lea&s;t touch'd her Fame.</P>
<P>SHE is admired and courted by &s;everal, and,
after &s;ome time, married by a Per&s;on of good
Fortunes, and even &s;uperior Birth; a Man of
Honour and of Quality, and yet, which is now
very rare, a Man of Virtue: He is pleas'd with
his Bride to the la&s;t degree; vain of her
Beauty; boa&s;ts of her as a Prize carry'd by his
good Fortune from &s;o many Pretenders. But,
alas! what Shagreen covers the u&s;ual Smile that
<PB N="36" REF="48">
&s;at upon his always plea&s;ant Countenance!
What Torment &s;well'd his Brea&s;t, when, within
the compa&s;s of half a Year, he finds the vir|tuous
Charmer, the Mi&s;tre&s;s of his cha&s;t Af|fections,
not only with Child, but not able any
longer to conceal, that by the unalterable Laws
of Nature it could not be his.</P>
<P>HE is &s;urprized, he charges her with it, &s;he
confe&s;&s;es it with the utmo&s;t Te&s;timonies of pe|nitence
and regret for the Injury done him,
and, with the f$rce of an inimitable Conduct,
reingages him; he forgives her, but finds out
the Man, fights him, wounds him, and is killed
him&s;elf in the unequal Quarrel. Mi&s;erable
Effect of abus'd Matrimony!</P>
<P>BUT even all this is not the great Point aim'd
at in this Work: Our View is the criminal u&s;e
of the lawful Liberties of Matrimony, and
that I &s;hall come to in its Place.</P>
<P>AMONG the&s;e however this is not the
lea&s;t, and therefore proper to this Place, <HI>viz.</HI>
That we find wrong Notions of the matrimonial
Vow, wrong Thoughts of the conjugal Obliga|tion
have po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the Minds of both Men
and Women, and they marry now meerly to
gratify the &s;en&s;ual Part, without the Views
which the Nature of the Thing, called Matri|mony,
ought to give them. This is what I
call making a je&s;t of the In&s;titution, that mar|ry
in &s;port, and, like the little Children, who
not knowing what they are doing, &s;ay to one
another, Come, <HI>Let us Play</HI> at Man and
Wife.</P>
<P>THEY that make a je&s;t of marrying, gene|rally
live to be the Je&s;t both of the married
and unmarried World; when they marry in je&s;t
they come to mourn in earne&s;t; they tie them|&s;elves
<PB N="37" REF="49">
in Bonds, re&s;olving not to be bound by
the Obligation; and where is the Hone&s;ty and
Ju&s;tice of this? They that have no Sen&s;e of
the matrimonial Obligation can have no Sen&s;e
of the conjugal Duty; they marry to lie toge|ther;
and they &s;atisfy the Appetite in the Plea|&s;ures
of the Marriage Bed. But when that's
over, all the re&s;t, which they had no View of
before, is a Force, a Bondage; and they as
heartily hate the &s;tate of Life as a Slave does
his Lot in <HI>Algier</HI> or <HI>Tunis.</HI></P>
<P>LET me go on a little then to furni&s;h the
growing World with better Notions of the
Thing; I &s;ay, let me take up a little of this
Work in the needful Enquiry of what Matri|mony
is, and how we ought to under&s;tand it.</P>
<P>THE Ladies indeed run the greate&s;t Ri&s;que
in marrying, but the Men cannot be &s;aid to
run no hazard, or to have nothing to lo&s;e;
a little Con&s;ideration before-hand would le&s;&s;en
the hazard on both Sides, and not only remove
the Dangers but prepare the Minds of the mar|rying
Couple to act their Parts wi&s;ely and pru|dently,
and to &s;uit them&s;elves to the particular
Circum&s;tances of the Condition which is before
them.</P>
<P>THIS due preparation of the Mind for the
married State, would prevent all the Abu&s;es of
it which I complain of in this Book.</P>
<P>WHEN they come together affectionately,
they will live together affectionately, at lea&s;t
they will not abandon all Affection to one ano|ther
afterwards, or not &s;o &s;oon; nor will it be
&s;o likely that they &s;hould declare open War
again&s;t one another &s;o &s;oon, as when they came
together without any previous Kindne&s;s, except
only from the Lips outward.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="50">
WHEN they come together deliberately, they
will keep together deliberately; they will not
be &s;o ready to cur&s;e the ra&s;hne&s;s and hurry of
their Marriage, or be &s;o ea&s;ily di&s;appointed
in one another.</P>
<P>AGAIN, and which is e&s;pecially to the Pur|po&s;es
mentioned hereafter in this Work, when
they come together <HI>Coolly</HI> and <HI>Mode&s;tly,</HI> they
will not be &s;o apt, by immoderate and furious
Exce&s;&s;es, to di&s;honour the Marriage Bed, and
abu&s;e one another, as too many do.</P>
<P>MATRIMONY is a &s;olemn Work, 'tis pro|po&s;ed
as a &s;acred In&s;titution, and the conjugal
State is, upon all Occa&s;ions, look'd upon, by tho&s;e
that con&s;ider and under&s;tand it, as a kind of
Civil E&s;tabli&s;hment in life; to engage in it
Ra&s;hly, and without Con&s;ideration, is perfectly
incon&s;i&s;tent with the Nature of the Thing, and
with all that is propo&s;ed in it, or expected from
it, at lea&s;t by wi&s;e and &s;ober People.</P>
<P>I cannot enter here upon a De&s;cription of all
the &s;everal Incidents which render a married
Life happy or mi&s;erable; they are innumera|ble,
and too long to meddle with in a Work &s;o
&s;hort as this. But as I am moving all tho&s;e
(young People e&s;pecially) who de&s;ign to marry,
to con&s;ider &s;edately and calmly, and weigh well
the Circum&s;tances, and all the Particulars of what
they are going to engage in, as well of Per&s;ons
as Things; &s;o I mu&s;t add, that let the Circum|&s;tances
of the married Couple be what they will,
I believe it will be univer&s;ally true, that tho&s;e
Matches &s;ucceed be&s;t which are entered into
with the mo&s;t &s;erious and thorough Delibera|tion;
duly debating all the Particulars of the
Per&s;ons; &s;eriou&s;ly engaging the Affections on
both Sides, by mutual reciprocal Endearments,
<PB N="39" REF="51">
and un&s;eigned &s;incere Love, founded on real
Merit, Suitability and Virtue. The&s;e confirm
the Felicity, if they may not be &s;aid really to
con&s;titute it: Nor, in a word, is there one
Match in fifty happy and &s;ucce&s;sful without
it.</P>
<P>NOW, to come to the la&s;t Clau&s;e in the Title
of this Chapter; it is for want of the&s;e calm
deliberate Proceedings in the <HI>Apparatus</HI> of
Matrimony, for want of weighing Circu&s;tan|ces,
and &s;uiting Per&s;ons to one another, that
Matrimony is &s;o often abu&s;ed; &s;uitability of
Per&s;ons is one of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t impor|tant
Difficulties that lie before the marrying
Couple for their Con&s;ideration. The Temper
of the Per&s;on is not ea&s;ily di&s;covered, nor does
it require a little Judgment and Di&s;cretion to
dive into the Di&s;po&s;ition of the Per&s;on; look|ing
too narrowly for Defects (&s;ince all Tempers
may have Failings) may be injurious on one
hand; as covering the Infirmities which di&s;|cover
them&s;elves too evidently, may be inju|rious
on another.</P>
<P>I knew a certain Lady in the critical Time
of Cour&s;hip, mighty inqui&s;itive about the
Qualifications, the Temper, and the Merit of
the Gentleman; and it was thought &s;he &s;hewed
abundance of Prudence and Caution in her Ob|&s;ervation
of his Conduct, and her Enquiries
into his Character. It happened, one particu|lar
Per&s;on, who was very intimate in the Fa|mily
of the Gentleman, and knew him more
particularly than mo&s;t did, had &s;o much Inte|grity
as to inform the Lady's Friend who &s;he
&s;ent to enquire about him, that he was a hard
Drinker, and that particularly he was very ill-humoured
and quarrel&s;ome when in drink; tho'
<PB N="40" REF="52">
'twas allowed that he was very well tempered
when &s;ober, and, in general, had the Character
of a good-humoured Man.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems no Body el&s;e was &s;o kind, or &s;o ju&s;t
to her, or &s;o well acquainted with his Humour,
as to acquaint her of this Part, but that one
Per&s;on; and the Lady either liking the Man, or
having particularly a mind to be married, or
what el&s;e over-ruled her, I know not, but &s;he took
this Account, which was the only faithful and
&s;incere one that &s;he had given her, to be mali|cious
and fal&s;e; &s;o &s;he went on with her Affair,
as before, giving no heed to what &s;he had been
&s;o kindly inform'd of.</P>
<P>BUT a little while after, as if Providence
had directed it for her more effectual Informati|on,
and particularly that &s;he might have no
excu&s;e, and none to blame but her &s;elf; I &s;ay,
a little after this, he happens to be very
Drunk, and, in his drink, he not only takes
care to give the Lady a Vi&s;it, but goes from her
to the Hou&s;e of one of her neare&s;t Relations,
and &s;hows him&s;elf there too.</P>
<P>THE Lady &s;urpri&s;ed, not at his Vi&s;it, but at
&s;eeing him in that Condition, as &s;oon as &s;he
could decently di&s;mi&s;s him, went big with her
di&s;covery, and greatly exa&s;perated as well
as di&s;appointed, to make her Complaint, and
give her Pa&s;&s;ions vent at her Relations, who I
mentioned above. But if &s;he was vexed and
di&s;appointed before, &s;he was both angry and
a&s;hamed now, to find he had &s;o little Di&s;eretion
in his Wine, as to go and &s;how and expo&s;e him|&s;elf
there, &s;o that when &s;he &s;aw it, &s;he could
not forbear reproaching him with it, and that
in the bittere&s;t Terms imaginable.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="53">
THE Gentleman &s;tood pretty patiently a
good while, and bore it all, better than they
that knew him expected he &s;hould, con&s;idering
he was very drunk, till the Lady giving her
Pa&s;&s;ions a full vent, fell upon him in a down|right
&s;cold, and ended it with a forbidding him
to wait upon her any more, that is to &s;ay, bad
him give him&s;elf no farther trouble about her,
for &s;he had enough of him, and the like.</P>
<P>THUS far, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> he held it very well, con|&s;idering
his Condition: But when &s;he came to
that Part, he looked &s;teadily at her, and with a
&s;miling plea&s;ant Countenance, contrary to his
u&s;ual Cu&s;tom when he had been drinking, he
turns to her, Ha Madam! <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> are you &s;o
hot and in &s;uch a rage! <HI>Pray, have you been drink|ing
too?</HI> That put her quite mad; and &s;he re|viled
him, told him &s;he &s;corn'd him, and his
Que&s;ion too, that &s;he would have him be in|formed
&s;he was no &s;uch Per&s;on, and a great
deal more. No Madam! <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> are you not
in drink, and yet can be in &s;uch a Rage?
Are you &s;o Pa&s;&s;ionate as this when you are &s;o|ber?
whereas, you &s;ee, I can be &s;uch a patient
Dog when I am drunk; why then, Madam,
&s;ays he, in good Faith, I'll take you at your
word, for you are not fit to make a Wife for
me. So he takes a Gla&s;s of Wine, and drinks
to her better Fortune, bad her good buy, and
immediately, paying his Re&s;pects to the Gen|tleman
of the Hou&s;e, he walks out, and goes a|way.</P>
<P>IF
&s;he was angry before, &s;he was calm, per|fectly
calm, and &s;urprized to the la&s;t degree, to
&s;ee her &s;elf treated &s;o &s;oberly by a Man that
was hardly him&s;elf; and that &s;he was rejected
in earne&s;t, whereas &s;he had rejected him but in

a kind of a Pa&s;&s;ion, and did not intend to be
taken at her word.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, notwith&s;tanding all this, and
notwith&s;tanding &s;he &s;aw him in drink &s;everal
times after that, and &s;ometimes when he did not
pre&s;erve his Temper, as he did then, yet this Lady
married him after it all; <HI>And what followed?</HI>
As &s;he had rea&s;on to expect, &s;o it prov'd; &s;he
was as compleatly mi&s;erable in a Husband as a
married Life could well make any Woman be;
for he proved not only drunken, but a pa&s;&s;ionate
outragious Wretch in his drink, and that to her
in particular.</P>
<P>IT is true, he was very obliging and good-tempered
out of his Exce&s;&s;es; but then, as he
grew older, the Vice encrea&s;ed upon him; till
at la&s;t, &s;o little made him drunk, and he was &s;o
&s;eldom &s;ober, that &s;he had the mo&s;t Vexations,
and the lea&s;t Intervals of Quiet that ever Lady
had; and all this for want of obeying not only
the intelligence of her faithful Friend, but
even the kind di&s;covery which Providence made
to her, as it were, on purpo&s;e, and pa&s;t her
being able to doubt the truth of it; &s;o that in|deed
&s;he had no Body to blame.</P>
<P>BUT to return to the Ca&s;e, and not to in&s;i&s;t
upon the drunkenne&s;s of a particular Per&s;on,
here or there, which may be &s;aid to be an Ac|cident
to the Temper, but without this, the
di&s;cording Tempers of the Party is as great,
and as effectual a Cau&s;e of the abu&s;e of the ma|trimonial
Peace, as any thing el&s;e can be.</P>
<P>I have mentioned the &s;ad Con&s;equences of
di&s;cording Con&s;titutions, in a Chapter by it
&s;elf, and which often occa&s;ions a great abu&s;e
of the matrimonial Duty, and particularly of
the Marriage Bed; but that is not the Point I
<PB N="43" REF="59">
am upon here; the difference of Tempers is yet
a thou&s;and times wor&s;e, for this makes a conti|nued
Breach in every thing they do or &s;ay, ru|ins
the whole Family-Peace, de&s;troys the Com|fort
of Life, expels Religion and every good
thing; for, as the Scripture &s;ays, <HI>where there is
Strife and Contention, there is every evil Work.</HI></P>
<P>'TIS the horror of Matrimony when two
contrary Tempers come together, when Fire
and Tinder meet, they certainly blaze toge|ther;
when the Spark and the Gunpowder touch,
the whole Hou&s;e is blown up; 'tis great pity to
&s;ee in &s;ome Families a patient Wife and a fu|rious
Husband, or a patient &s;ober Husband, and
a termagant fiery Scold; becau&s;e there is the ut|mo&s;t
Oppre&s;&s;ion on one &s;ide, and the utmo&s;t Rage
and Violence on the other.</P>
<P>BUT to have two <HI>Devils</HI> together in one
Hou&s;e, what can be expected but Ruin and
Confu&s;ion to the whole Family? and at la&s;t
either &s;eparation or de&s;truction.</P>
<P>IT is meerly for want of a &s;uitability of Tem|per,
that the Peace of &s;o many Families is lo&s;t
and de&s;troyed, and Matrimony abu&s;ed, and that
&s;o many, once happy People, are made mi&s;e|rable.
But I &s;hall &s;ay more of this &s;till.</P>
<P>MATRIMONY is a &s;tate of Union, 'tis the
neare&s;t union that the Sexes can be placed in.
This Union is appointed in order to the mutual
felicity of the Parties; 'tis then a &s;tate that
both Parties &s;hould be particularly careful of,
and of their Conduct in, that they may make
it an&s;wer the End for which it was &s;o ap|pointed,
namely to pre&s;erve, and indeed to
procure, the mutual Happine&s;s to the Parties,
and make that Union effectual.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="60">
HOW impo&s;&s;ible do we make this to our
&s;elves, when we invert the great End and De|&s;ign
even of GOD him&s;elf, who in&s;tituted and
appointed it; and when we make the &s;acred Or|dinance
a retreat for Crime, a cover for our
Exce&s;&s;es, and a protection to the mo&s;t abomi|nable
Practices.</P>
<P>THIS is what I call abu&s;ing the &s;tate of
Matrimony as well as di&s;honouring the Con|tract.
Matrimony is not a &s;ingle Act, but it
is a Condition of Life, and therefore when
People are new-married, they are &s;aid to have
altered their Condition; it is a Series of Unity
contracted by, and &s;hould be made up of agreeing
Habits; where the Harmony is broken, the &s;tate
of Life is abu&s;ed; when the Parties cea&s;e to be
united, and to be united too in that which is
right, the Life is no more matrimonial; 'tis a
Jargon of Speech, a Word without &s;ignifica|tion,
to call it a matrimonial Life.</P>
<P>IN the Contract the Parties bind them&s;elves
to live in this Harmony and &s;tate of Union;
what el&s;e is under&s;tood by living <HI>according
to GOD's holy Ordinance.</HI> How do they live
according to a holy Ordinance, who&s;e Conver|&s;ation
even towards one another, and with one
another, pollutes and defiles the &s;tate of Life,
and would the very Ordinance too, if that were
po&s;&s;ible?</P>
<P>HOW the Conver&s;ation between a Man
and his Wife may and does pollute and de|file
the matrimonial State, (however &s;trange
&s;uch a thing may be) is the Subject of the
following Chapters, where the Affirmative will,
I doubt not, be clearly made out.</P>

and in what &s;en&s;e I under&s;tand it in the
following Work. I repeat nothing.</P>
<P>I am now to explain another Term equally
&s;ignificant, tho' little taken notice of among us,
a Word thought to be difficult, but is not diffi|cult;
ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to be under&s;tood to|wards
the right reading this Book, and parti|cularly
u&s;eful to its explanation, I mean MA|TRIMONIAL
CHASTITY; 'tis the Breach of
this Cha&s;tity that is the Subject of the whole
Work, and 'tis therefore, I &s;ay, ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to under&s;tand what it is.</P>
<P>THE exerci&s;e of lawful Enjoyments is one
of the greate&s;t Snares of Life; where Men
&s;eem to be left to their own Latitudes, 'tis too
natural to think they are not obliged to any Re|&s;traint;
but 'tis a great Mi&s;take: Chri&s;tian Li|mitation
is the true mea&s;ure of human Liberty;
where Heaven has had the goodne&s;s to leave us
without a limitation, he expects we &s;hould li|mit
our &s;elves with the more exactne&s;s; and
perhaps 'tis the intent and meaning of that
&s;eeming unlimited Liberty (for 'tis no more)
that our Virtue may have a fair Field for its
trial, and that we may more eminently &s;hew
our Chri&s;tian Temperance, in u&s;ing tho&s;e Li|berties
with the &s;ame Moderation where we
have no po&s;itive Re&s;traints impo&s;ed, as we
would others, where we are under a direct and
ab&s;olute Command.</P>
<P>BEING therefore about to reprehend the
Breaches of this Moderation, and, in a word,
to combat the Exorbitances of unlimited Life,
'tis ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to know what they are;
and to lay down, with the utmo&s;t plainne&s;s
<PB N="47" REF="63">
that decency will permit, what it is I am to
engage again&s;t, and for what Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>CHASTITY is a Virtue much talked of,
little practi&s;ed, a great Noi&s;e is made with the
word <HI>Cha&s;tity,</HI> and, on many Occa&s;ions, where
little true regard is had to the thing, and per|haps
where 'tis little under&s;tood; 'tis taken
among us for a meer Regulation of Manners,
and a kind of Government of Life. But the
definition is infinitely &s;hort of the thing it
&s;elf, which is of a high and &s;uperior kind; it
is a rectitude of Nature, an inherent Bright|ne&s;s
of the Soul, I'll give you a better de&s;crip|tion
of it pre&s;ently, and a better de&s;criber
al&s;o, for I mu&s;t &s;peak with Authority, if po&s;|&s;ible,
where I have &s;o much to &s;ay, and which
you will like &s;o little.</P>
<P>IF <HI>Cha&s;tity</HI> in general be &s;o little under|&s;tood,
the <HI>Cha&s;tity</HI> I &s;peak of is infinitely more
out of the way of your ordinary thinking: <HI>Ma|trimonial
Cha&s;tity!</HI> 'tis a new &s;trange Term, &s;aid,
one of my critical Ob&s;ervers before I publi&s;hed
this Work; you mu&s;t be &s;ure to tell us what
you mean by it, or it will not be intelligible:
What, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> are you going to lay down Rules
and Laws for the Marriage Bed! Are you going
to enclo&s;e what Heaven has left free, and pre|tending
to &s;hew us the deficiency of GOD's
Laws, &s;upply that deficiency with &s;ome wi&s;er
Rules of your own? 'Tis again&s;t Nature, as well
as again&s;t Heaven. But this Reproof is mi&s;|placed,
and the Reprover mi&s;taken. I am far
from adding to the Re&s;traints that Nature, and
the GOD of Nature have laid upon us, but am
for &s;hewing you what Re&s;traints they are; and
particularly to let you &s;ee, there are &s;ome Re|&s;traints
<PB N="48" REF="64">
where you &s;ugge&s;t, and perhaps believe,
there are really none.</P>
<P>YOU acknowledge, that <HI>Cha&s;tity</HI> in general
is a Virtue, and a Chri&s;tian Duty; and I affirm
there is a particular <HI>Cha&s;tity,</HI> that is to &s;ay, a
limited Liberty, which is to be ob&s;erved and
&s;trictly &s;ubmitted to in the conjugal State;
This I call <HI>Matrimonial Cha&s;tity,</HI> and the Breach
of this I call, as in my Title, matrimonial
Whoredom; let others call it what they will, I
can give it no other Name than what I think it
de&s;erves.</P>
<L>&startq;Tho' they're called Mi&s;&s;es which lewd Men adore,</L>
<L>I cannot guild their Crimes, a Whore's a Whore.&endq;</L>
<P>HAVING thus entered upon the difficult
Task of reproving tho&s;e criminal Practices of
Men, which are acted under the &s;helter of &s;up|po&s;ed
lawful Liberty, I mu&s;t &s;tate the due
Bounds and Extent of that Liberty, that we may
the better ground our future Cen&s;ures, and be
able to ju&s;tify the Reproof from the Rules e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
in the Foundation.</P>
<P>NOW, that I may do this with the better
Authority. I begin with quoting the late Pious
and Reverend Dr. <HI>Taylor;</HI> in his Book of <HI>Holy
Living,</HI> he has a whole Chapter upon this very
Subject, I mean of <HI>Cha&s;tity,</HI> and I cannot take
my Arguments from a better Beginning.</P>
<P>&startq;Cha&s;tity, &s;ays the Doctor, is the Circumci|&s;ion
of the Heart, the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing all irregu|lar
De&s;ires in the Matter of carnal and &s;en|&s;ual
Plea&s;ures.&endq;</P>
<P>HERE the Doctor has made a Provi&s;ion to en|counter
the merry Di&s;putants of this Age, as
pungent and as natural, as if he had been now
<PB N="49" REF="65">
alive, and knew the highth to which the corrupt
Imaginations of Men have carried tho&s;e irregular
De&s;ires: What do you pretend to call Irregular,
&s;aid a cavilling favourer of Vice to me once,
al&s;o before this Book was thought of? What
can be Irregular between a Man and his
Wife?</P>
<P>I &s;hall have more to &s;ay to that Que&s;tion in
the next Chapters, and doubt not to &s;peak to
the Conviction of rea&s;onable Creatures: As to
human Brutes I am not looking towards them,
much le&s;s talking to them in a Di&s;cour&s;e of
<HI>Cha&s;tity;</HI> let them alone to their <HI>irregular De|&s;ires,</HI>
and let the &s;ucce&s;s of tho&s;e gratify'd De|&s;ires
be their reprover; they generally end
in Repentance, or, which is wor&s;e, Self-re|proaches.
But I come back to Dr. <HI>Taylor.</HI></P>
<P>&startq;I call all tho&s;e De&s;ires irregular, &s;ays the
Reverend Doctor.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;1. THAT are not within the <HI>holy In&s;ti|tution,</HI>
or within the Protection of <HI>Mar|riage.&endq;</HI></P>
<P>&startq;2. THAT are not within the Order of Na|ture.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;3. THAT are not within the Moderation
of Chri&s;tian Mode&s;ty.&endq;</P>
<P>IN this la&s;t Head he includes (to u&s;e his own
Words) <HI>all immoderate u&s;e of permitted Beds,</HI>
which is exactly to the purpo&s;e that I am
&s;peaking of, and upon which Subject the &s;econd
Chapter of this Book is chiefly employ'd.</P>
<P>&startq;CONCERNING which, <HI>&s;ays the &s;ame worthy
Author,</HI> Judgment is to be made as concern|ing
Meats and Drinks, there being no certain
degree of frequency or intention pre&s;cribed to
<PB N="50" REF="66">
any Per&s;on, but it is to be ruled as the other
Actions of Man's Life are ruled, <HI>viz.&endq;</HI></P>
<P>&startq;1. BY the Proportion to the End.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;2. BY the Dignity of the Per&s;on as a
Chri&s;tian.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;3. BY the other Particulars, of which he
&s;peaks afterwards.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;CHASTITY (&s;ays he) is the Grace which
forbids and re&s;trains all the&s;e, keeping both
the Body and the Soul pure, in the &s;tate GOD
has placed it, whether of a &s;ingle or married
Life, 1 <HI>The&s;&s;.</HI> iv. 3, 4, 5.&endq;</P>
<P>AND now having quoted &s;o eminent an
Author as Dr. <HI>Taylor,</HI> who&s;e Works are &s;o well
known, let me put all my good Friends, <HI>who
watch for my halting,</HI> in mind, that the Doctor
having this very Article upon his Hands, and
being re&s;olved to &s;peak critically, and yet fully,
to it, he takes all due caution in the doing it,
ju&s;t as I have done. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> He cautions the
Reader again&s;t unju&s;t Cen&s;ure and Reproach.
(2.) He then fortifies him&s;elf again&s;t the
Fears of it: And, <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> &s;peaks boldly and
plainly where Duty calls upon him to do &s;o.
Ju&s;t in this manner you may expect me to
act, in that critical Article of Liberty which
is before me.</P>
<P>THE Doctor, it appears, knew how the
World was vitiated, and the Minds of Men
corrupted, even in his Day, and that it was a
mo&s;t dangerous thing to &s;peak of &s;uch things as
the&s;e in the Ears of a lewd Set of People, which
the World was then full of; That they would cor|rupt
the mo&s;t &s;anctified Advice, and in&s;ult the
Advi&s;er, and therefore as I have done here, &s;o

the devout Doctor gives caution, and enters his
Prote&s;t again&s;t mi&s;con&s;truction and mi&s;under|&s;tanding
of what he was to &s;ay; this he
does with infinite Mode&s;ty and Re&s;erve, but
ventures for all that upon the Reproof as a
nece&s;&s;ary Work; his Example is highly u&s;eful
to me in this equally nece&s;&s;ary Work, of lay|ing
open the Crimes of the pre&s;ent Age;
which, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, is much far|ther
advanced in Wickedne&s;s than the Times
the Doctor lived in. His Words are the&s;e:

<P>THUS far Dr. <HI>Taylor.</HI> He had but one Chap|ter,

of Cha&s;tity, and yet you &s;ee how wary he was,
lea&s;t the ill dige&s;ture of the Times &s;hould turn
that which he de&s;igned for the whole&s;ome Nou|ri&s;hment

purpo&s;e. How much more have I ju&s;t ground to
warn the Reader of this Work, that he may for|bear
reading it with a De&s;ign to gratify or plea&s;e
a tainted and vitiated Imagination? Let him
rather prepare to read a ju&s;t Reproof of the vi|le&s;t
Actions, with the &s;ame dete&s;tation and ab|horrence
that I write it with, and with &s;uch
clean Thoughts as becomes a Mind &s;ea&s;oned
with Virtue, awed by Religion, and prepared
by a due Reverence to the divine Command.</P>
<P>To <HI>the pure</HI> all things <HI>are pure,</HI> to <HI>the unclean</HI>
all things <HI>are unclean;</HI> they that are di&s;po&s;ed to
ridicule and make a je&s;t of the ju&s;t Satyr here
pointed at Crime, will but make a je&s;t of them|&s;elves;
&s;ince nothing can be more evident than
the Offence, nothing can be more ju&s;t than
the Reproof. If Men will defile them&s;elves, as
the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;ay, <HI>no Man can dight them.</HI> 'Tis very
<PB N="53" REF="69">
&s;trange a Man &s;hould be afraid to expo&s;e a
Crime for fear of encrea&s;ing it, as if the very
Shame &s;hould excite to the Sin.</P>
<P>BUT I mu&s;t keep to the Point, and to which
I re&s;olve to confine my &s;elf. <HI>Cha&s;tity</HI> is no po|pular
Subject, 'tis &s;o broken into upon all Hands,
and with &s;uch a Gu&s;t of general de&s;ire, that to
rake into the Filth mu&s;t be di&s;agreeable to the
generality of People; and tho' I do not let it
alone for that Rea&s;on, being not at all reluctant
to an attack upon a Crime, becau&s;e grown fla|grant
and univer&s;al, yet at pre&s;ent I am upon
another Subject; I am attacking a Crime
equally odious, but which is not equally ac|knowledged
to be a Crime, a Wickedne&s;s which
even &s;ome that pretend to Purity of Life will
not allow to be wicked.</P>
<P>SO much more is the Danger, when Men
walk among Barrels of Gunpowder, and know
it not to be Gunpowder, who &s;hall be cautious
of his Candle? It is not &s;o hard to per&s;uade
&s;uch Men to &s;hun the Evil, as to convince them
that it is an Evil; they cavil at the very Title
of this Chapter <HI>Matrimonial Cha&s;tity,</HI> 'tis Non|&s;ence,
they &s;ay, in the Nature of the thing;
Virgin Cha&s;tity indeed, and Cha&s;tity of a &s;ingle
Per&s;on, is &s;omething, and would bear to be
exhorted to; but married Cha&s;tity is what they
will by no means under&s;tand, or bear a Reproof
about.</P>
<P>BUT becau&s;e I have, as I &s;aid above, a whole
Chapter upon this very Subject, and only men|tion
it here with re&s;pect to Opinions of good
Men about it, give me leave to quote the Re|verend

<P><PB N="54" REF="70">
DR. <HI>Taylor,</HI> in his Di&s;cour&s;e of <HI>Cha&s;tity</HI> men|tioned
above, after having &s;poken of Virgin
Cha&s;tity and Vidual Cha&s;tity, comes of cour&s;e
to mention the very Thing I am now upon,
and in the very &s;ame Terms, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>MATRIMONIAL CHASTITY.</HEAD>
<P>And I choo&s;e to give it you in his own Words,
becau&s;e, before I remembered that the Doctor
had mentioned this Ca&s;e, I had fini&s;hed the
next Chapters, <HI>viz.</HI> of the Bounds and Limita|tions
which Mode&s;ty and Decency had placed
to the Liberties of the Marriage Bed, and which
the Doctor's Opinion &s;o far confirms, that I could
not but &s;ubjoin his Thoughts after my own was
gone to the Pre&s;s. The Doctor's Rules for mar|ried
Per&s;ons are thus expre&s;s'd:</P>
<P>&startq;CONCERNING married Per&s;ons, be&s;ides
the keeping their mutual Faith and Contract
with each other, the&s;e Particulars are u&s;eful
to be ob&s;erved.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;1. ALTHOUGH their mutual Endearments
are &s;afe within the Protection of Marriage,
yet they that have Wives or Husbands, mu&s;t
be as tho' they had them not; that is, they
mu&s;t have an Affection greater to each other
than they have to any Per&s;on in the World,
but not greater than they have to GOD: but
that they be ready to part with all Intere&s;t in
each other's Per&s;on, rather than &s;in again&s;t
GOD.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;IN their Permi&s;&s;ion and Licence, they mu&s;t
be &s;ure to ob&s;erve the Order of Nature, and
the Ends of GOD. <HI>He is an ill Husband, that
u&s;es his Wife as a Man treats a Harlot,</HI> having
no other End but Plea&s;ure. Concerning
<PB N="55" REF="71">
which our be&s;t Rule is, that although in this,
as in eating and drinking, there is an Appe|tite
to be &s;atisfied, which cannot be done
without plea&s;ing that de&s;ire; yet &s;ince that
de&s;ire and &s;atisfaction was intended by Nature
for other Ends, they &s;hould never be &s;eparate
from tho&s;e Ends, but always be joined with all
or one of tho&s;e Ends, <HI>with a de&s;ire of Children,
or to avoid Fornication, or to lighten and ea&s;e
the cares and &s;adne&s;&s;es of Hou&s;hold-affair, or to
endear each other;</HI> but never with a purpo&s;e,
either in act or de&s;ire to &s;eparate the &s;en&s;ua|lity
from the&s;e Ends which hallow it. <HI>Onan</HI>
did &s;eparate his Act from its proper End, and
&s;o ordered his Embraces that his Wife &s;hould
not conceive, and GOD puni&s;hed him.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;3. MARRIED Per&s;ons mu&s;t keep &s;uch mo|de&s;ty
and decency of treating each other, that
they never force them&s;elves into high and
violent Lu&s;ts, with arts and misbecoming de|vices:
always remembring that tho&s;e Mix|tures
are mo&s;t innocent which are <HI>mo&s;t &s;imple</HI>
and <HI>mo&s;t natural, mo&s;t orderly</HI> and mo&s;t &s;afe.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;4. IT is a duty of matrimonial Cha&s;tity to
be re&s;trained and temperate in the u&s;e of
their lawful Plea&s;ures: Concerning which,
although no univer&s;al Rule can antecedently
be given to all Per&s;ons, any more than to all
Bodies one proportion of Meat and Drink;
yet married Per&s;ons are to e&s;timate the degree
of their Licence according to the following
Proportions. 1. That it be moderate, &s;o as to
con&s;i&s;t with Health. 2. That it be &s;o ordered
as not to be too exten&s;ive of Time, that pre|cious
opportunity of working out our Sal|vation.
3. That when Duty is demanded it
be always payed (&s;o far as in our Powers and
<PB N="56" REF="72">
Election) according to the foregoing Mea&s;ures.
4. That it be with a temperate Affection,
without violent tran&s;porting De&s;ires, or too
&s;en&s;ual Applications. Concerning which a
Man is to make Judgment by proportion to
other Actions, and the Severities of his Reli|gion,
and the Sentences of &s;ober and wife
Per&s;ons; always remembring, that Marriage
is a Provi&s;ion for &s;upply of the natural Ne|ce&s;&s;ities
of the Body, not for the artificial and
procured Appetites of the Mind. And it is
a &s;ad truth, that many married Per&s;ons think|ing
that the Flood-gates of Liberty are &s;et
wide open without Mea&s;ures or Re&s;traints (&s;o
they fail in that Channel) have felt the final
Rewards of their Intemperance and Lu&s;t, by
their unlawful u&s;ing of lawful Permi&s;&s;ions.
Only therefore let each of them be temperate,
and both of them be mode&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>THUS far the Reverend Doctor, a Man who&s;e
Character gave him an undoubted Right to the
Title of a true &s;piritual Guide, thorowly qua|lified
in his time for a Teacher of Holy Living.</P>
<P>I add nothing, only that here is a Confirma|tion
indeed unexpected of all the Principles
which I have advanced in this Work.</P>
<P>HERE is a full Conce&s;&s;ion to the real occa&s;ion
and even nece&s;&s;ity of my pre&s;ent Undertaking;
the Doctor grants, that married Per&s;ons even at
that time thought the Flood-gates of Liberty were
&s;et open to them, and that (as I &s;aid) Mode&s;ty
and Decency was at an End after Marriage, and
there was no more Re&s;traint between a Man
and his Wife.</P>
<P>BUT you will find the Doctor quite of another
Opinion, as I al&s;o am; and I am very glad to have
&s;o unque&s;tioned an Authority for my Opinion.</P>

and &s;leeps &s;afely, <HI>and with &s;ecurity to her Virtue</HI>
with him, all the Night: And this is her Place,
her Property, her Privilege, exclu&s;ive of all
others, for he is her own, and &s;he is his; he is
the <HI>covering of the Eyes to her,</HI> and &s;he is called,
in the &s;acred Text, the <HI>Wife of his Bo&s;om;</HI> &s;he
has the only right to lodge there; it is her Re|treat,
the Repo&s;itory of her Cares, as well as of
her Delight, and of her Affection.</P>
<P>AND if it is not thus with both or either of
them, nay, if it was not thus before they mar|ried,
let them flatter them&s;elves as they plea&s;e
with the formal Marriage, or the formality of
Matrimony, I in&s;i&s;t they have violated the
Laws of GOD and Man, in their coming toge|ther;
violated their &s;olemn Oath and Covenant
to one another after coming together; and
whatever they are in the Sen&s;e of the Law,
they are really no Man and Wife at all in the
Sen&s;e which I am giving of Things: Whether
I am in the right or no, I refer to the Judg|ment
of the impartial Part of &s;ober Mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="75">
HAVING &s;aid thus much by way of ad|vance,
I think 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to take notice here
how ju&s;t it is, and indi&s;pen&s;ibly, nay, ab&s;olute|ly
nece&s;&s;ary to the Happine&s;s of a married Life,
that the Per&s;ons marrying &s;hould have not only
an Acquainiance with one another before Mar|riage,
but that they &s;hould be engaged to each
other by a &s;olid and durable Affection, profe&s;|&s;ing
to love, and not only profe&s;&s;ing but &s;in|cerely
loving one another, above all other
Per&s;ons choo&s;ing and being the real choice of
each other: This is not a &s;mall and trifling
thing, it is the chief Article of Matrimony, tho'
not included and a&s;&s;erted in the Contract, 'tis a|thing
of the utmo&s;t Con&s;equence to the future
Happine&s;s of the Parties. However, as I pur|po&s;e
to &s;peak to it again fully and at large, in
a Part by it &s;elf, I only leave it here as a
Memorandum proper to the Place, and re&s;erve
the re&s;t to what &s;hall come after. I return now
to the Ca&s;e of Matrimonial Liberty.</P>
<P>HAVING advanced thus much in favour of
the utmo&s;t Freedoms between Man and Wife,
and which I might enlarge upon, but that I
believe there is really no Occa&s;ion; I think I
grant as much in it as I need to do, in Conde|&s;cen&s;ion
to the Propo&s;ition mentioned in the
Introduction, namely, that there can be no Of|fence
between a Man and his Wife, that Mo|de&s;ty
is at an End, that 'tis cancelled by the
very nature of the Thing, that all Things are
Decent, all Things mode&s;t, all Things lawful
between a Man and his Wife; all which, in a
few Words, I deny, and in&s;i&s;t, that there are &s;e|veral
Things yet remaining, which &s;tand as
Boundaries and Limits to the Freedoms and In|timacies
that are otherwi&s;e to be allowed between
a Man and his Wife.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="76">
AND fir&s;t, I in&s;i&s;t that the&s;e limitations
of the conjugal Liberties are placed in the open
View of both the Man and his Wife, by the
Laws of Nature; &s;o that both of them are fur|ni&s;hed
with Principles of Reluctance and Aver|&s;ion,
&s;ufficient, if duly li&s;ten'd to, and if the
Laws of Nature are obeyed, to arm them again&s;t
any Breaches of tho&s;e Laws. It is evident
in many Ca&s;es, too many, had it not plea&s;ed
GOD to &s;uffer it to be &s;o, that the Laws of Na|ture
have a much &s;tronger Influence upon us
than the Laws of our Maker; and this is e&s;pe|cially
remarkable in tho&s;e Ca&s;es, where the
Laws of Nature &s;eem to give &s;ome Latitudes
which the Laws of GOD, and In&s;titutions of
his Providence, have thought fit to limit and
re&s;train. <HI>For example;</HI></P>
<P>THE Laws of Nature dictate the propagation
of Kind by the intercour&s;e of Sexes; the Laws
of GOD &s;ub&s;equent to tho&s;e of Nature, limit
and re&s;train the Particulars of this Propagation,
namely, that the Man (by Man there is to be
under&s;tood Man or Woman) &s;hould be allowed
but one Woman at a time, that they be bound
together by the &s;acred Bonds of Matrimony in|di&s;&s;olvable,
after once engaged in, and there|fore
&s;acred, and to be inviolably adhered to, and
pre&s;erved by both Parties.</P>
<P>IT is true, that there is a corrupt Prin|ciple
inbred and indwelling, taking a kind of
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, too much in Man's Nature, degene|rated
as it is by the Fall; this corrupt Prin|ciple
dictates the Propagation of the Kind, that
is, as a Law of Nature, but does it without
regard to the limitations impo&s;ed by Heaven
upon the Branches; that is to &s;ay, without
entring into the Engagements of Matrimony,
<PB N="61" REF="77">
and this makes tho&s;e Actions criminal, which
otherwi&s;e would have been lawful; makes the
Man commit a Crime in that very Action, which
done under due Regulations and Limitations,
that is to &s;ay, in Wedlock, would not only be
lawful, but his commanded Duty.</P>
<P>IT is the &s;ame afterwards; <HI>for example,</HI>
when tho&s;e Limitations are obeyed and &s;ub|mitted
to, I mean, the Limitations of Matri|mony,
there are (as I have ob&s;erved) yet
farther Limitations, which the Laws of Nature
concur with the Laws of GOD in, and which
the Man is obliged to ob&s;erve, tho' this corrupt
Principle would fain evade and avoid them;
the&s;e are &s;uch as I hinted to be contained in the
Words <HI>Decency</HI> and <HI>Mode&s;ty:</HI> Now tho' much
of the Obligation is taken off by the allowed
Intimacies between a Man and his Wife, and a
full and free Intercour&s;e of Sexes is granted; yet
I mu&s;t be pardoned the liberty of &s;aying, there
are Bounds and Limitations of Decency, Mo|de&s;ty
and Moderation, which &s;tand as a Pale
about even their matrimonial Liberties, and
&s;ay to them both, in the mid&s;t of their greate&s;t
Endearments, Hitherto &s;hall you go, <HI>and no
farther.</HI></P>
<P>AS I am &s;peaking to the married Per&s;ons
only, in this Part, I need explain my &s;elf no
farther than to &s;ay, there are Bounds and Mea|&s;ures,
Times and Sea&s;ons, which Nature and
Decency always will dictate to them, and will
regulate too, and teach them to regulate be|tween
them&s;elves their mo&s;t intimate conju|gal
Delights and Embraces: The&s;e nothing but
an Appetite criminally immoderate, and under
no Government, no not of Rea&s;on, Religion,
<PB N="62" REF="78">
Philo&s;ophy, or common Sen&s;e; will tre&s;pa&s;s or
break through.</P>
<P>I hope I have hitherto kept the Bounds of
Decency, and given no Offence, though I am
reproving one of the mo&s;t notorious Breaches
of conjugal Mode&s;ty; a thing even Nature her
&s;elf abhors, tho' Nature vitiated may be &s;aid to
be the Occa&s;ion of it; I &s;ay, Nature, under any
ju&s;t Regulation of Sen&s;e, Nature, ab&s;tracted
from criminal Habits, abhors, it; and, which is
more, Nature &s;peaks plainer in her Reproofs of
that Crime than I dare do, while the Product
of tho&s;e impure and unlawful, however matri|monial
Liberties, carry the indelible Marks of
their Parents unhappy Exce&s;&s;es and Intempe|rances
in their Faces, and on the blotch'd and
bladdred Skin of their Po&s;terity for many
Years, nay, to their dying Days. As if Nature
had declared to them, that &s;he was able to &s;hew
her Re&s;entment for the Breach of her tacit and
&s;ecret Inhibitions; and that though they broke
in upon her in &s;ecret by the power of an
inflamed and vitiated Appetite, and thought
them&s;elves out of the reach of Puni&s;hment,
yet that &s;he was able to do her &s;elf Ju&s;tice upon
them, in a manner that they could not e&s;cape,
and which &s;hould fix a la&s;ting Infamy upon
both the Offence and the Offender, by a Pu|ni&s;hment
which they &s;hould neither be able to
avoid or to conceal.</P>
<P>I need explain my &s;elf no farther, Nature
does it for me; and I have, by her Indulgence,
a full liberty to touch this tender Part with the
&s;tricte&s;t Ob&s;ervation of my own Rules, &s;ince
&s;he has &s;poken it aloud, and has made the
Crime of the Parent flagrant in the very Pic|tures
of their Po&s;terity.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="79">

making them bear the unhappy Reproach of
their Fathers and Mothers <HI>Conjugal Lewd|ne&s;s?</HI></P>
<P>I
need &s;ay no more to this, but to remind
tho&s;e that are guilty, that the more mode&s;t
Brutes of the Fore&s;t, who obey the Laws of
Sen&s;e, and follow the Dictates of meer Nature,
do not act thus: The <HI>Wild A&s;s,</HI> which the

of all the Fore&s;t, yet the Text &s;ays, <HI>in

and &s;o have all the re&s;t of the be&s;tly
Creatures, and they all ob&s;erve them &s;trictly
and &s;uitably to the Rea&s;ons of Nature, Man
and Woman only excepted.</P>
<P>THIS I call, and I think ju&s;tly too, as it re|&s;pects
one Part only, a Branch of <HI>Matrimonial
Whoredom,</HI> and thus I keep clo&s;e to my Title.</P>
<P>I could load this Part with a throng of Ex|amples,
a cloud of &s;elf-condemned Witne&s;&s;es,
and &s;ome who&s;e Stories I can the le&s;s bear to
relate without blu&s;hing, becau&s;e they are ar|rived
to &s;uch a Pitch of Wickedne&s;s as to make
it publick them&s;elves without &s;hame. But, as
I &s;aid above, Nature has printed upon the
tainted poi&s;oned Faces of their Po&s;terities, &s;uch
indelible Spots, has branded them with &s;uch

Reflection to them&s;elves, rather than Scan|dal.</P>
<P>AS
to &s;ome others, who I could mention too
both Chri&s;tian and Sirname, and who richly de|&s;erve
it; who are &s;o far from Shame, that they
make it every Day the boa&s;ts of their Coffee|hou&s;e-chat,
their Table-talk, and ordinary Con|ver&s;ation;
I leave them to the di&s;mal Time of
Reproach, when tho&s;e unhappy Children which
they now are not a&s;hamed to &s;how one another
as the Examples of their Wickedne&s;s, &s;hall
again remind them of it, and cur&s;e them to
their Faces.</P>
<P>THE Ca&s;e indeed will not bear entering far|ther
into Particulars; nor will it &s;o much as al|low
the nece&s;&s;ary Expo&s;tulations which I &s;hould
otherwi&s;e make here with tho&s;e married Chri|&s;tains,
(for &s;uch I am talking to) who I would
per&s;uade to reflect upon it; 'tis hard, that nei|ther
the Ca&s;e it&s;elf will bear an enquiring into,
nor the Per&s;ons guilty bear to be talked to.
How can any Per&s;ons who are really guilty of
this conjugal Uncleanne&s;s, reproach an Author
for the Sin of naming what they are not
a&s;hamed of doing? I look upon the Crime with
Abhorrence, and I could refer you to the
Scripture, where it is branded with a Title that
de&s;erves it; as I &s;ay, I look on the Crime with
Abhorrence, &s;o I add, that I look on the Per|&s;ons
with &s;omething beyond it, and can only
add this of them, that as they were not to be
touch'd under the Law, &s;o they are not to be
named under the Go&s;pel. GOD would not take
them for <HI>Jews</HI> till they were wa&s;h'd, and I
<PB N="65" REF="81">
&s;hall never take them for Chri&s;tians till they
reform; let them read their Reproof at large in
<HI>Levit.</HI> xv. to which I refer.</P>
<P>I cannot quit this Part without making &s;ome
Reflections upon parallel Ca&s;es. I have heard
&s;ome &s;erious and learned Divines &s;ay, that it is
a wor&s;e Crime, and de&s;erves a &s;everer Cen&s;ure
from Man, (ob&s;erve they did not &s;peak of what
either of them merited above) for a Man and
Woman under Promi&s;es of Marriage to lie to|gether
before the Marriage is compleated, than
a &s;imple or &s;ingle Fornication between two
who have no de&s;ign of Matrimony, that is in
&s;hort, between what we ordinarily call a Whore
and a Rogue; and I confe&s;s, though at fir&s;t I
he&s;itated a little at it, I am fully &s;atisfied it is
&s;o; and the Rea&s;ons the &s;aid &s;erious Divines
gave me confirm me in that Opinion.</P>
<P>FOR a Man to commit a &s;ingle Fornication, <HI>&s;ay
they,</HI> he Sins again&s;t GOD, and his own Soul,
there is no Room to deny that; the Scripture
is clear, and the Laws of GOD and Man concur
in the Cen&s;ure, as they do in the Prohibition:
But for a Man to make a Whore of the very
Woman who he intends and really de&s;igns to
make his Wife, or, in plain <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> to make a
Whore of his Wife; he defiles his own Bed,
pollutes his own Seed, &s;preads Ba&s;tardy in his
own Race, and &s;hews a mo&s;t wicked vitiated
Appetite, that could not with-hold him&s;elf
from her <HI>meerly as a Woman,</HI> till the Performance
of a lawful Marriage might make it &s;ea&s;on|able,
as well as lawful; &s;uch a Man &s;atisfies the
brutal Part at the expence of his Wife's Fame,
his Child's Legitimacy, and to the &s;candal and
offence of all good People that &s;hall hear it,
<PB N="66" REF="82">
and who cannot name it without pity, or ab|horrence,
on account of the Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>THIS is the Ca&s;e indeed, where a Man acts
&s;uch a wicked and &s;candalous Part; he appa|rently
expo&s;es and di&s;honours his Wife, as well
as him&s;elf nor is it &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that the
Woman di&s;honours her &s;elf too, or that there is
much more of the Blame lies on him than on
her; for as &s;he &s;ufficiently bears her Share of the
Reproach, &s;o &s;he bears more of the Scandal, than
the Man; nay, &s;he expo&s;es her &s;elf, not to the
World only, but to her Husband afterward;
and much might be &s;aid to that: Nor is it out
of the que&s;tion, for it is indeed a Matrimonial
Whoredom in the literal Sen&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT as &s;uch I &s;hall &s;peak of it again. I am
now naming it as it is a parallel Ca&s;e to that
I had been ju&s;t now &s;peaking of, wherein there
is a ju&s;t equality, and a proportion of Particu|lars
very appo&s;ite to one another; for here is a
horrid Complication of the like Crimes, the
Man defiles his own Bed, expo&s;es his own
Wife, contaminates and corrupts his own Blood,
&s;preads Di&s;tempers and Poi&s;on upon his own
Race, and all this from one of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Pieces
of Immode&s;ty, and wor&s;t of Brutality, that can
be expre&s;s'd in Words; an infamous kind of
eagerne&s;s or appetite, ungovernable by his Rea|&s;on,
being unable (or pretending to be &s;o at
lea&s;t) to with-hold him&s;elf from her till other
Particulars might take off the little Re&s;traints,
and leave him at liberty.</P>
<P>LET &s;uch Men go not to the Fore&s;t and the
Bea&s;ts only, for they act from a much better
Motion, but to the more rational, more mode|rate
and better governed Savages of the <HI>Indies,
Fa&s;t</HI> or <HI>We&s;t,</HI> to the Negroes of <HI>Africa,</HI> the
<PB N="67" REF="83">
<HI>Potiguara</HI>'s of <HI>Bra&s;ile,</HI> nay, to the very <HI>Hotten|tots</HI>
of <HI>Monomotapa,</HI> and the Cape of <HI>Good Hope;</HI>
they will find Rea&s;on and Nature too pre|vails
among them to act quite otherwi&s;e, and
that while Rea&s;on and Nature concur in arm|ing
them again&s;t it, &s;o they more punctually
obey the command of both, and have this hor|rid
Practice in the greate&s;t dete&s;tation. But
here, let us blu&s;h, and &s;ay no more, for no mo|de&s;t
Language can fully expre&s;s it.</P>
<P>I return to the Principle, which is the Pro|po&s;ition
in this Chapter, That there is a need|ful
Mode&s;ty and Decency requi&s;ite even be|tween
a Man and his Wife after Marriage, and
not de&s;troyed by their Matrimony. Certainly
People do not by Matrimony cea&s;e to be Men
and Women, nor do the Man and Woman cea&s;e
to be rational Creatures, much le&s;s do they cea&s;e
to be Chri&s;tians; let every marry'd Couple re|member
tho&s;e three Things, and I am fully a&s;|&s;ured
they will take care not to de&s;erve the Re|proof
of this Chapter.</P>
<P>THIS is then that Circum&s;tance in the mar|ried
State, where, I &s;ay, a Re&s;erve is placed be|tween
the Sexes, even between the Man and
his Wife; where that which we call Mode&s;ty
remains as an indelible Bond upon them both,
even after Marriage: They that &s;ay there is no
Mode&s;ty to be named after Matrimony, but that
there is a perfect unlimited and unbounded Li|berty
on both Sides, either do not know, or do
not rightly con&s;ider the Laws of Nature, the
Con&s;titution Bonds, which, as Matrimony does
not remove from the Sexes, &s;o neither does it
remove the Obligation from either Sex to regard
them. One would think indeed the Power of Na|ture
&s;hould be &s;uch, and the Sen&s;e of the&s;e things
<PB N="68" REF="84">
be &s;o plainly &s;tampt in the Minds of rea&s;ona|ble
Creatures, that there &s;hould be no need, or
indeed room for the Caution. But as the
Breach of this Law, however &s;candalous, is &s;o
vi&s;ible among us; it merits to &s;tand foremo&s;t
among the conjugal Crimes I am now to re|prove.</P>
<P>I
fore&s;ee what &s;ome of my merry Readers
will think they are to hear of next, <HI>viz.</HI> that I
&s;hall preach Lectures of matrimonial Modera|tion,
or Satyrize &s;ome of their boa&s;ted Exce&s;&s;es;
but they will be unhappily di&s;appointed, my
Care of avoiding to reprove in <HI>Words at length;</HI>
what &s;ome of them are not a&s;hamed to boa&s;t of
in <HI>Words at length,</HI> will perhaps leave &s;ome
People to go more unreproved than they de|&s;erve.</P>
<P>YET
let <HI>J&mdash;A&mdash;</HI> take a mode&s;t Hint upon
the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Indecency of that kind, which this
Part of the Town has ever &s;hown, and which he
acted in &s;ight and hearing of more of his
Friends than approved the &s;candalous Prac|tice;
when, with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Immode&s;ty, he
gave the detail of his Marriage Night's Per|formances,
to a grave and eminent Magi&s;trate
of the City upon the open <HI>Exchange,</HI> and was
hand&s;omely reproved and expo&s;ed for it, as he
de&s;erved. When Men glory in their Shame,
they make Indecencies of that which might
otherwi&s;e not be &s;uch, and they break the
Rules of Mode&s;ty without Doors, when perhaps
they did not within. But this Part of the Sa|tyr
goes no farther than the Fact, I return to
the Subject it &s;elf.</P>
<P>EVERY wi&s;e Man would act the Part of a
wi&s;e Man, were there no Law to re&s;train him.
Prudence dictates to Men of Prudence, and
<PB N="69" REF="85">
Mode&s;ty to Men of Mode&s;ty the great Law of
Matrimony is a &s;trict Union of the Per&s;ons;
this Union extends to many other Things, as
well as to the Union of Sexes, and, among the
re&s;t, there is, or &s;hould be, a Union of Kindne&s;s
moving to a gentle and tender u&s;ing one ano|ther
in Matters of Civility and Courte&s;y, as
well as in Matters of Mode&s;ty. Certainly the
Rules of Civility are not aboli&s;hed by Matri|mony;
Should not the Man and his Wife be
civil and ju&s;t to one another, becau&s;e they may
be free? That's a &s;trange Freedom that obliges
us to be rude and di&s;obliging.</P>
<P>NOW the&s;e Rules of Decency which, I &s;ay,
are not de&s;troyed by Matrimony, extend to
many things even between a Man and his
Wife, which I have not yet mentioned, and
which I have with regret ob&s;erved to be broken
into by &s;ome who had been better taught, and
who ought to have known by the Laws of
good Manners how to have acted after another
fort; the Branches I point at now may be
touch'd more clo&s;ely, and will admit of &s;peak|ing
plainer <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> than tho&s;e I have ju&s;t now
mentioned, and though the Immode&s;ty may in
many Things be as great, and that it comes
from the &s;ame corrupt, vicious Original, either
in the Man or the Woman, yet they are not
expre&s;s'd in &s;o open and &s;o &s;candalous and of|fen&s;ive
Terms.</P>
<P>THE <HI>fir&s;t Ca&s;e is,</HI> when either the Man or
Woman make injurious Reproaches upon one
another for natural or accidental Infirmities,
incapacitating them to an&s;wer and &s;atisfy mu|tual
Expectation; that is to &s;ay, to an&s;wer con|jugal
Duties; and this more e&s;pecially when
tho&s;e Infirmities have not been Ante-matrime|nial,
<PB N="70" REF="86">
not before Marriage, but occa&s;ioned by
Di&s;temper or Di&s;a&s;ter afterward, and tho&s;e Di|&s;tempers
or Di&s;a&s;ters &s;uch as are truly ca&s;ual,
and to be hone&s;tly accounted for. There mu&s;t
certainly be a great defect of Mode&s;ty in the
Man or the Woman, who can reproach the Wife
or the Husband in &s;uch a Ca&s;e as this.</P>
<P>A Lady, who&s;e Name I reflect on with di&s;dain,
but conceal it in Charity, after having had five
fine Children by her Husband, having, tho' with
Civility too, been deny'd &s;omething which &s;he
de&s;ired, and which he thought a little too ex|pen&s;ive
for his Circum&s;tances, after &s;ome warm
Words, but le&s;s criminal, turned from him with
&s;corn, and told him, he might let it alone &s;ince
he was grown &s;o &s;aving &s;he would not ac|cept
of it now, <HI>he might keep it for his next
Child.</HI></P>
<P>THE Gentleman had about two Years before
had a Fit of Sickne&s;s, which had brought him
very low, and by which he was grown a
little Paralitick, how it affected his natural
Powers, could not perhaps be under&s;tood &s;o
well by any Body as by his Wife: But &s;uppo&s;|ing
the wor&s;t, it was not without the utmo&s;t
Breach of Decency and Mode&s;ty, &s;uppo&s;ing
none to have been pre&s;ent but them&s;elves; that
&s;he could reproach him with that Part of it in
&s;uch a manner; but it was infinitely more &s;o,
and &s;he was inexcu&s;ably guilty, that &s;he did it in
the hearing of others, and with &s;ome kind of
Additions of Banter and Raillery too, which
fat very ill upon her Tongue at that time.</P>
<P>IT is true, the Folly of it retorted exceeding|ly
upon her Fame, and &s;oon got into the
Months of &s;ome of her &s;atyrical Neighbours,
who &s;ailed not to make her very angry, I had
<PB N="71" REF="87">
rather I could have &s;aid a&s;hamed, upon hearing
of it again: But it had no Effect upon her as
to her Conduct to him, nor could &s;he refrain
doubling her Reproaches between them&s;elves,
which her Husband, being a Man of Spirit,
re&s;ented to the highe&s;t Degree: This put an
end to all conjugal Kindne&s;s between them, and
ruined their Family-Peace, till &s;he at length
made him her Je&s;t, and that in Company too;
yet &s;he got nothing by him this Way neither;
for he taking the Je&s;t with a &s;mile of Contempt,
as indeed it de&s;erved, frequently an&s;wered, that
he would hire her a Journeyman, &s;ince &s;he took
&s;uch Care to let every Body know &s;he had Occa|&s;ion
for one, that if one was not enough for her,
as he thought it would not, he would provide
her two or three, that, if it were po&s;&s;ible, &s;he
might be &s;atisfied, though he very much doubt|ed
it. This was very bitter upon her, 'tis true,
but &s;he extorted it from him; indeed till he
took this Cour&s;e with her, he could by no Per|&s;ua&s;ions,
by no Arguments, nor by any Ways
that he could u&s;e, prevail with her to hold her
Tongue, nor indeed did tho&s;e Reproaches, how|ever
&s;evere, put an End to it, but they went on
continually bantering and making a Je&s;f of
one another, and &s;uch like undecent and un|kind
Things as the&s;e pa&s;s'd &s;o openly, and &s;o
often between them, that at length it occa|&s;ioned
a Separation for a time; and the Husband
being too hard for her, it ruined her Character
and Reputation, and though it did not her
Virtue, as tho&s;e believed who had Charity for
the Lady, and I, among the re&s;t, yet &s;he re|tained
the Blot of it almo&s;t as much as if &s;he
had had the guilt, and that as long as &s;he
lived.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="88">
THESE are &s;ome of the Things which Mo|de&s;ty
and Decency forbids between a Man and
his Wife; the contrary is a Debt to conjugal
Affection on one hand, and to Laws of Decency
and good Manners on the other, both which
no matrimonial Familiarities or Intimacies can
de&s;troy.</P>
<P>AND here give me leave to ob&s;erve, though
not with the &s;ame Reflection, and without any
Satyr upon the Thing as Criminal and Immo|de&s;t;
that, however the matrimonial Intimacies
between a Man and his Wife, may di&s;charge
them of much of the Bondage of Ceremony in
their Conver&s;ation, yet I can by no means
agree, that becau&s;e a Woman has given her
&s;elf up to him without any re&s;erve, all ten|derne&s;s
and regard to her as a Woman, and all
di&s;tinction in Company &s;hould be taken away;
that &s;he &s;hould have no re&s;pect &s;hown to her in
whatever Circum&s;tances &s;he is con&s;idered, but, on
the contrary, that therefore her Husband &s;hould
treat her with Rudene&s;s and Indecency, want
of Manners, and eyen of Re&s;pects ever after.
There are &s;ome remains certainly of the fir&s;t
Civilities due to the Wife after Marriage, which
were paid to her in her di&s;tant Circum&s;tances,
as a Maid, before, and in the time of Court&s;hip;
and unle&s;s the Wife her &s;elf forfeit them by
any bruti&s;h di&s;obliging Things on her Side,
they are not entirely obliterated by Matrimony,
no not to the la&s;t.</P>
<P>ON this Account, though I cannot &s;ay that a
Life of Ceremony between Man and Wife
&s;hould be recommended, yet certainly a Life
of Civility &s;hould; they &s;ay that Ceremony de|ftroys
Affection, and, in &s;ome re&s;pects, I don't
know but it may, and when we &s;ee a Man and
<PB N="73" REF="89">
his Wife, however great, always bowing and
&s;craping and &s;inking to one another, we are apt
to &s;ay there's more Manners than Affection
between them.</P>
<P>BUT on the other hand, when the Husband
and Wife are &s;o far from treating one another
with Ceremony, that they cannot keep up
common Civility, but that they treat one ano|ther
with Di&s;dain and Contempt, there's a cer|tain
lo&s;s both of Affection and good Manners
too.</P>
<P>FOR this Rea&s;on I would advi&s;e all the good
Husbands and Wives that will accept that Ad|vice,
never to mingle their Di&s;cour&s;es, e&s;pe|cially
before Company, with Raillery and Je&s;t
upon one another; when a Woman once comes
to make a Je&s;t of her Husband, &s;he is loft, &s;he
is gone; and when the Man makes a Je&s;t of his
Wife he is <HI>a going,</HI> at lea&s;t in my Opinion: I
&s;hall explain the Words <HI>gone</HI> and <HI>going</HI> pre&s;ent|ly;
when a Man makes a Je&s;t of his Wife every
Body believes he hates her; when the Woman
makes a Je&s;t of her Husband, they believe &s;he
cuckolds him.</P>
<P>AT lea&s;t 'tis a fatal Sign that all conjugal
Affection is dead and buried from between
them. I frequently vi&s;ited my Friend <HI>M</HI>&mdash;,
when his Wife and he had been married about
two Years, but I was mo&s;t irk&s;omely enter|tained
every time with his Banters and Turns
of Wit, his Sarca&s;ms, Je&s;ts, and indeed Buf|foonry,
all upon his Wife; I ob&s;erved at fir&s;t
&s;he took it well enough, and now and then
gave him a &s;mart return, which was not to his
Advantage; for &s;he had a World of Wit, but
her Mode&s;ty and Sen&s;e convinced her, without
any Bodies reproof, that it was no Part for a
<PB N="74" REF="90">
Wife to act; that her Husband was wrong in
it, and &s;ometimes that would fetch &s;ome Tears
from her: But &s;he would not imitate that in
Practice which &s;he thought &s;o ill became her
Husband, &s;o &s;he bore it all as an Afflic|tion.</P>
<P>I had in Friend&s;hip &s;everal times gently
hinted to Mr. <HI>M</HI>&mdash;, that I thought he
was too hard upon his Lady, that he knew &s;he
was a Woman of good Breeding, and had an
uncommon &s;hare both of Wit and good Hu|mour;
but he might ea&s;ily &s;ee &s;he was not plea|&s;ed
with it, and that he &s;eemed really to oppre&s;s
her with it.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, he went on, and putting one
time very hard upon &s;omething in her Beha|viour,
which he pretended not to like, though
really without Cau&s;e; &s;he coloured at his Words,
which &s;hew'd &s;he re&s;ented them, and was mov'd;
but &s;he immediately recovered her &s;elf, and
keeping back all her Re&s;entment, &s;he, with an
inexpre&s;&s;ible Goodne&s;s in her Face, and a Smile,
&s;aid to him, <HI>My Dear, you would like it in any
Body but your Wife.</HI></P>
<P>I was indeed &s;urprized at it, but her Husband
much more; and after the Conver&s;ation was
over, he came to me eager to &s;peak: Well, <HI>&s;ays
be,</HI> you heard what a Blow my Wife gave me;
I acknowledge &s;he has conquered me; I &s;hould
have really liked it if it had been any one
el&s;e, and I was entirely wrong; but I'll take
your Advice, a Man &s;hould never make a com|mon
Je&s;t of his Wife, and I'll do it no more I
a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
<P>I was mightily plea&s;ed to &s;ee the Effect it had
upon him; for this Humour of je&s;ting with his
Wife, or rather making her the con&s;tant Sub|ject
<PB N="75" REF="91">
of Ridicule and Je&s;t, came up to this at
la&s;t, that &s;he could do nothing that would plea&s;e
him; but, in &s;hort, every thing that his
Wife did was to be laught at, becau&s;e his Wife
was to be laught at.</P>
<P>THIS is the familiarity which the Proverb
&s;ays breed Contempt, and it does &s;o for Men
pre&s;ently je&s; away their Re&s;pect for their
Wives, and after that their Affection; though
Ceremony between Man and Wife le&s;&s;ens Af|fection,
or rather &s;hews it was wanting before,
yet Affection does by no means le&s;&s;en Civility,
Ceremony may le&s;&s;en Affection, but Di&s;re|&s;pect
murthers it, &s;trangles it. A Man can
never pretend to love his Wife and have no
Re&s;pect for her at the &s;ame time; that would be
to love her, and not to love her altogether,
which is incongruous in its Nature.</P>
<P>MIRTH between a Husband and Wife is
the heighth of Affection, but that's no Mirth
that is always running down, bantering and
playing the Buffoon with his Wife; a chearful
Affection is the Beauty of a conjugal State;
but what Chearfulne&s;s is there in making a Ban|ter
and Je&s;t of one another, what Mirth when
they make game, not with one another only, but
at one another.</P>
<P>IT is really an odd kind of Conver&s;ation be|tween
a Man and his Wife, when they come
into publick Company, to have them turn
their Drollery one upon another, and run out
in Banters again&s;t them&s;elves; the World will
not fail to make a Je&s;t of tho&s;e who fir&s;t make
a Je&s;t of them&s;elves, and to take all the Jokes,
Turns and Returns which they pa&s;s upon one
another, to be founded upon Fact, and that
every Je&s;t &s;o rais'd is a true Je&s;t; in &s;hort, 'tis a
<PB N="76" REF="92">
mo&s;t prepo&s;terous Piece of Folly, and de&s;erves
more Satyr than I have Room to be&s;tow
upon it here; I may &s;peak of it again in its
Place.</P>
<P>I knew a Couple of married Wits who fre|quently
je&s;ted thus with one another till they
quarrelled, and indeed, it generally ended in a
Quarrel; when it was come up to its highth,
they went to their &s;eparate A partments, and
perhaps did not &s;ee one another for &s;everal
Weeks, one living at one End of the Hou&s;e,
and the other at t'other End; half a dozen
times a Day, or more, they would &s;end Letters
to one another, filled with bantering bitter
Sarca&s;ms and Satyrs, &s;ometimes in Ver&s;e, in
Song and in Di&s;tichs, other times in Pro&s;e,
with &s;candalous Reproaches, filled with immo|de&s;t
Expre&s;&s;ions of the vile&s;t Sort, and not fit
to be repeated, unle&s;s I &s;hould break the
Rules I have pre&s;cribed both to my &s;elf and
others.</P>
<P>IN this manner they would &s;ometimes
live for a Month or two together, never &s;paring
to give the utmo&s;t Provocation, and to re|ceive
it with the extreame&s;t Indignation, till
they run one another out of Breath with their
ill U&s;age; and then, as Storms, when they have
&s;pent their Strength, and their Fury is abated;
it would gradually wear off, the Fire and Brim|&s;tone
being exhau&s;ted, they would begin to
cool again, and &s;o come with as little Cere|mony
to an Accommodation, as they had with
little Decency fallen out.</P>
<P>WHAT need is there of abundance of Di&s;|cretion
as well as Affection between a Man and
Wife, to pre&s;erve the Rules of Decency, and
to keep up the Bounds of Mode&s;ty in their
<PB N="77" REF="93">
Family-Conver&s;ation? This is a Rea&s;on why
it is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to Matrimony, that the Per|&s;ons
&s;hould be Lovers as well as Relatives,
that there &s;hould be an engaged a&s;&s;ured Affec|tion
before there be a Political Union between
them: Without this 'tis very difficult to ren|der
the married State a Scene of happy Cir|cum&s;tances,
and a Condition truly calculated
for humane Society; but of that al&s;o in its
Order, for I mu&s;t give you a whole Chapter
upon that Head.</P>
<P>JUSTICE is another of the Particulars which
Decency &s;till requires between a Man and his
Wife; he is far from acting decently with a
Wife that will not on all Occa&s;ions do her Ju&s;|tice:
To be injurious to a Wife de&s;troys all Fa|mily-Peace
between them; and whether this
Inju&s;tice be occa&s;ioned by and relating to Mat|ters
of Property? or Matters of Duty, 'tis all
the &s;ame; there is no Decency can be pre&s;erved
where Ju&s;tice is not done; if the Wife he op|pre&s;&s;ed,
if her Right and Allowances expre&s;ly
capitulated for are unju&s;tly detained from her,
or if &s;he be any way &s;tript, either of her Orna|ments,
or of her Settlements, the&s;e are inju|rious
things which de&s;troy Affection, and the
de&s;troying of Affection ruins the Peace of
the Family.</P>
<P>BUT I am a little gone beyond my Subject,
which relates only to per&s;onal Virtue, and the
Re&s;erves which Mode&s;ty &s;till makes nece&s;&s;ary
between a Man and his Wife; and there are
&s;ome Things even of that kind which &s;till re|main.
It is true, &s;ome of them are &s;uch as
cannot bear the mentioning without Breach of
the Mode&s;ty which I am &s;peaking to protect,
and breaking into tho&s;e Bounds which I re|&s;olve
<PB N="78" REF="94">
not to offend again&s;t: Other Things may
be &s;o explained as to be under&s;tood by tho&s;e,
e&s;pecially to whom they belong, for the guilty
will &s;ee the Arrow &s;hot at them which others
cannot perceive.</P>
<P>THE Indecencies and Immode&s;ties of the
Tongue de&s;erve a Place here, and I in&s;i&s;t that,
even between a Man and his Wife, there are
due Bounds to be ob&s;erved in both the&s;e, e&s;peci|ally
when they &s;peak not only to, but of one
another in the hearing of others.</P>
<P>THERE is a Mode&s;ty of the Tongue which
never for&s;akes a Woman of Virtue, no not in
her mo&s;t intimate conver&s;ing with her own
Husband, but much more at other times; all
Breaches of this kind touch even her Virtue it
&s;elf, and are Branches of that which I call
conjugal Lewdne&s;s, which is to be carefully
avoided among Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>NOR is the Man exempted from this Mode&s;ty
of the Tongue, not only with his Wife, but
e&s;pecially when of or to his Wife before Com|pany:
Nothing is more unworthy a mode&s;t
and Chri&s;tian Man than to talk lewdly of, or to
his Wife before Company; a Man ought never
to force Blu&s;hes from his Wife on account of
their own Privacies and Intimacies; this is to
make tho&s;e Things criminal which in them|&s;elves
are lawful. I know not any one Thing
that &s;its wor&s;e upon a Man's Tongue than to
laugh at, jeer, and flout his Wife with what
had pa&s;s'd between them in their retired Con|ver&s;ations,
and this before other People; 'tis
the mo&s;t odious, hateful, and, to a mode&s;t Ear,
nau&s;eous, of all Di&s;cour&s;e, and yet nothing is
more frequent, and even among People of Fi|gure
too, which, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I have often
<PB N="79" REF="95">
wondered at, con&s;idering the Pretences we now
make to polite Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>BESIDES, 'tis a Breach of Decency as it re|&s;pects
his Wife of the vile&s;t and mo&s;t &s;canda|lous
kind, and if &s;he is a mode&s;t and virtuous
Woman, as well as a good Wife, is &s;ufficient to
make her abhor his Society, and to refu&s;e to
appear in Company with him, even in his own
Hou&s;e, nay, and if continued, will not fail in
time to make her hate him, which is the wor&s;t
Condition an hone&s;t Man can ever wi&s;h to be
in with a Wife.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed 'tis a wife Man's Bu|fine&s;s
after Matrimony, by all means po&s;&s;i|ble
to pre&s;erve the Affection of his Wife en|tire,
to engro&s;s her to him, and to make and
keep him&s;elf the &s;ingle and entire Object of
her be&s;t Thoughts. If &s;he is once brought to
hate him, to have an aver&s;ion to him, to loath
and abhor him, &s;he mu&s;t have an uncom|mon
Stock of Virtue, and be more a Chri&s;tian
than he ought to expect of her, if &s;he does not
&s;ingle out &s;ome other Object of her Affection;
and can a Man think his Wife, who is thus
every Day di&s;obliged, in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t manner
ill u&s;ed, and, in &s;pite of her Re&s;entments,
expo&s;ed to be laught at by him, will long pre|&s;erve
an inviolable Affection to him; but I
may touch this again.</P>
<P>I return to the Subject. There are yet
greater Offences again&s;t Mode&s;ty than the&s;e;
As I &s;aid above, that giving unju&s;t Retorts,
and making unkind and indecent Reproaches
in ca&s;e of ca&s;ual or accidental Weakne&s;s and
Impotence, are &s;candalous Breaches of Mode|&s;ty
between a Man and his Wife. So be|&s;ides
this, there are yet a numberle&s;s Variety
<PB N="80" REF="96">
of Violences, as I may call them, committed,
likes Rapes upon Nature, in which nothing is
more frequent than for a Husband to pre&s;s a
Wife to &s;uch and &s;uch Things as Morality and
Mode&s;ty forbids.</P>
<P>THIS is highly injurious to the conjugal Af|fection,
and expo&s;es the Per&s;on guilty to a ju&s;t
Cen&s;ure, nay, even to the Cen&s;ure mentioned
of <HI>Matrimonial Whoredom:</HI> Whether the&s;e Ex|ce&s;&s;es
or Violences con&s;i&s;t in Negatives, or in
Affirmatives, they are in their kind equally cri|minal.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that Language is want|ing
here, and Words cannot fully expre&s;s the
meaning, &s;o as to pre&s;erve the Decency I pro|fe&s;s;
and I may be asked what I mean when I
cannot explain it, not for want of knowing my
own meaning, but for want of Words to expre&s;s
it; and therefore, as above, I choo&s;e to be &s;ilent,
I'll come as near the Ca&s;e as I can without giv|ing
offence, and what cannot be &s;aid with De|cency
mu&s;t be omitted; I had &s;aid, that per&s;o|nal
Weakne&s;&s;es and Infirmities on either Side
ought not to be retorted between a Man and
his Wife, much le&s;s expo&s;ed, &s;o I now &s;ay, they
much le&s;s ought to be oppre&s;s'd on that Account.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> I am &s;peaking now, not of natural and
original Impotencies, which, being before Mar|riage,
ought to have been di&s;covered, and which
our Law makes &s;ufficient to di&s;&s;olve the Con|tract,
and &s;eparate the Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>THERE has been foul Work enough made
with the&s;e Things in print by particular, lewd,
and ob&s;cene Publications, which mode&s;t Ears
are &s;ick of, and the Nation mourns for the Of|fence
of it; but my Di&s;cour&s;e looks quite ano|ther
Way.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="97">
BESIDES, our Office of Matrimony &s;o|lemnly
charges and adjures the Per&s;ons who
come to be joined together, that if they know
any &s;uch Impediments they &s;hould declare
them at that time; and, in a manner, prote&s;ts
again&s;t the Validity of the Marriage in Ca&s;e of
a failure, and therefore and from that very
Prote&s;t, &s;uch Marriages are afterwards fre|quently
made void by Parliament.</P>
<P>BUT as the Subject of my Ob&s;ervation is
more nice, &s;o it is al&s;o more mode&s;t, and may
with more decency be con&s;idered of. The In|firmities
on either Side which human Body is
&s;ubject to are many; I di&s;tingui&s;h them not here,
only that I profe&s;s to mean &s;uch Infirmities as
regard the Sexes only, Phy&s;icians, <HI>Acouchers</HI> or
Surgeons, and Anatomi&s;ts under&s;tand, and can
de&s;cribe them; 'tis none of my Bu&s;ine&s;s, much
le&s;s my De&s;ign.</P>
<P>IT frequently does, or at lea&s;t may happen,
that when a young Couple come together their
Con&s;titutions may, as too often their Tempers
may and do, differ from one another, with re|&s;pect
to the&s;e Things, to the greate&s;t Extreme;
one is weak, faint, the Spirits low, Nature un|able
to an&s;wer what is expected; <HI>another</HI> per|haps
is reduced by Child-bearing, too thick and
and too long together, by Accidents in often
hard and difficult Travels, Injuries received by
unskilful Hands, or many other Incidents
and Circum&s;tances not to be named; by the&s;e,
I &s;ay, the Per&s;on is reduced, debilitated, and
render'd unfit to give the Satisfaction which
has formerly been found: On the other hand,
the Man is reduced by a tedious, lingring de|cay,
which Phy&s;icians call a Con&s;umption; or
by other acute Di&s;tempers, which he can, as is
<PB N="82" REF="98">
&s;aid before, account for without Scandal; and
to which Men are as frequently &s;ubject, and as
much di&s;abled by them, as Women are in the
Ca&s;es mentioned ju&s;t now; &s;uch as Stone, Gout,
Palfies, Epilep&s;ies, Rheumaticks, Drop&s;ies, and
&s;uch like.</P>
<P>IF either or any of the&s;e Circum&s;tances in
Man or Woman happens, where they are joined
re&s;pectively to another that is &s;trong, ro|bu&s;t,
in perfect vigour, the Spirits high, the
Blood hot, and perhaps boiling, Nature for|ward,
and craving De&s;ire un&s;atisfied; I need
go no farther to explain it; What wretched
Work does this cau&s;e between the ill-match'd
Couple? I can openly &s;ay I know a beautiful
young Lady after bringing her Husband &s;everal
Children, yet actually de&s;troyed, I might have
&s;aid murthered, by the&s;e conjugal Violences,
to &s;ay no wor&s;e of them; and I make no di&s;|ference
'tis the &s;ame on the other Side; ma|ny
a Man &s;inks under the Weight of his own
Deficiencies; he is a&s;hamed to decline the Duty
of the Marriage-bed, di&s;dains to be thought
unable to &s;atisfy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I can go no farther, and the Reader will ex|cu&s;e
the Interruption. I refer you to a &s;tated

is among the <HI>Turks,</HI> yet the rea&s;on of the Prac|tice
is not the le&s;s or the more. The <HI>Turks</HI>
think this very Ca&s;e, whether of the Man's

is given in tho&s;e Ca&s;es, not in a ludicrous manner
with game and &s;port, and a Court, or rather
Croud, &s;tanding round, to laugh and make a je&s;t
either of one Side or other; but with a &s;olemn
Gravity, &s;uitable at lea&s;t to the Dignity of the

which both Sides pay to the Laws
them&s;elves.</P>
<P>NOR is the Method wholly <HI>Turki&s;h,</HI> and to
be objected again&s;t as a Piece of <HI>Mahometan</HI>
Original; but 'tis founded upon the antient
u&s;age of all the Ea&s;tern Countries, in who&s;e
Cu&s;toms it is to be found, though with &s;ome
Variation, even as far back as the <HI>Phenician</HI> and
<HI>Carthaginian</HI> Empires, and as the <HI>Egyptian</HI> and
<HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Government and Monarchies. Hence
the Phra&s;e made u&s;e of in the Scripture by the
Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> called <HI>Due Benevolence,</HI> on one
hand is commanded; while on the other hand
<HI>Chambering and Wantonne&s;s,</HI> which is &s;uppo&s;'d
to relate to the pretended lawful Intimacies
between a Man and his Wife are forbidden.</P>
<P>IT may be expected I &s;hould explain my
&s;elf upon tho&s;e Scripture Expre&s;&s;ions and there
is &s;ufficient room for it, and that with decency
too; but I re&s;olve not to come to the brink of
the Offence, nor &s;hall the Reader be able to
&s;ay, I go all the length I might go.</P>
<P>THE Scripture Expre&s;&s;ions are expounded by
the Reverend and Learned Annotators, and to
them I refer; and as to the Courts of Ju&s;tice
under the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> deciding &s;uch Ca&s;es as
the&s;e, where Complaints are made by either
Sex, I could give large Accounts of them, but
<PB N="84" REF="100">
they would break in upon me in the grand
Difficulty, and offend the Reader; except a
Sort who I am not at this time about to plea&s;e.
Here therefore you mu&s;t allow me to omit a
large and, in its kind, u&s;eful Part of the De|&s;ign
it &s;elf, namely, the Reproof of &s;candalous
Violences on both Sides even in the Marriage
Intimacies, which cannot be &s;poken of with
Decency, and therefore mu&s;t go unreproved.
One would hope it is a &s;ufficient Reproof to
tho&s;e who under&s;tand what I mean.</P>
<P>WE are but too forward to &s;ay, that no one
ought to prohibit what GOD has not prohibited;
that what is lawful may lawfully be done, where
Nature dictates, <HI>&s;ay they,</HI> and Heaven has not
forbid, what can be pretended, that the Rule of
Mode&s;ty is expre&s;s'd by Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> thus:
<Q>&startq;By Nature prompted, by no Law deny'd,&endq;</Q></P>
<P>THAT all things within that Compa&s;s are
to be allowed, and to re&s;train farther, is to bind
heavy Burthens, which we will not bear our
&s;elves.</P>
<P>BUT my an&s;wer is &s;hort, where-ever an
unre&s;trained Liberty &s;eems to be given, yet
we ought to remember that GOD gave his Laws
to us as to rea&s;onable Creatures, not as to
Brutes; that we are to act in no Ca&s;es out of
the Bounds of Rea&s;on and Ju&s;tice, no nor of
Mode&s;ty and Decency; if the Circum&s;tances of
it &s;eem to be left to our Di&s;cretion, that Di&s;|cretion
&s;hould be limited by our rea&s;oning
Powers; if the Man or Woman, for I &s;peak of,
and to both, will tell me, that in the Extafies
of their Pa&s;&s;ion, or Affection, or Appetite, or
call it what you will, they are at liberty to
<PB N="85" REF="101">
lay a&s;ide the u&s;e of Rea&s;on, and act unlike a
Man, or a Chri&s;tian, or even a Brute; that he
is to be a Fury, outrageous, un&s;atisfied, and
entirely out even of his own Government;
That he or &s;he is to lay a&s;ide all Con&s;iderations
for the <HI>&s;he</HI> or <HI>be</HI> they are concerned withal; all
compa&s;&s;ion for Circum&s;tances, Infirmities, Weak|ne&s;s,<HI>&amp;c.</HI> of what&s;oever kind, or proceeding
from what&s;oever Cau&s;e; that they are at liberty
thus to be furious, and to act meerly in gratifi|cation
of their own Plea&s;ures, without any
other or better Con&s;ideration, and to do what|ever
they think fit in the pur&s;uit of their pre|&s;ent
gu&s;t of Appetite, even to the ruin and
de&s;truction of the Husband or Wife; I &s;ay, if
this can be made appear to be ju&s;t, then I am
an&s;wered.</P>
<P>BUT if not, then Rea&s;on, and Mode&s;ty, and
Virtue ought to be li&s;tened to; and the cravings
of Nature, if they are extravagant, &s;hould be
governed by the Rules which Nature is &s;ub|jected
to. The thing is a Di&s;ea&s;e and a Di&s;|temper
in it &s;elf, and though it may be called
Con&s;titution and Nature, 'tis a mi&s;take; 'tis
not Con&s;titution, but a Plague in the Con&s;titu|tion;
'tis a kind of Fever or Calenture in the
Blood; 'tis, in a word, to carry it no farther, a
Frenzy in the Creature; whether in the Head
or el&s;ewhere, is not to the purpo&s;e, but &s;uch it
is; and they ought to apply to Art, I mean
Phy&s;ick, to abate the Acrimony of their Blood,
re&s;train the Exce&s;&s;es of high feeding, hard
drinking, and luxurious living; reducing
them&s;elves at lea&s;t &s;o, as to bring under the
Fle&s;h; bring Nature under the Government of
Rea&s;on, and, in &s;hort, bring the Body under the
<PB N="86" REF="102">
command of the Soul, for that is the whole
Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>I might give &s;ome Examples of this Mode|ration
as it has been happily practised among
Chri&s;tians in our Age, and that even among Men
of the highe&s;t Rank, and above the Re&s;traint of
Laws. Take one particular Relation which I
had from an unque&s;tionable Author, that is to
&s;ay, from a grave Mini&s;ter who had been con|ver&s;ant
in the very Hou&s;hold, and the Truth
of who&s;e Relation I cannot doubt. &startq;There
was a certain reigning Prince not long ago
alive in the World; I do not &s;ay there are
many &s;uch left, who after having had five
Sons, and mo&s;t of them Men of Fame as
well as high Birth, and &s;till living, had this
particular Circum&s;tance attending his Mar|riage-bed;
his Prince&s;s was reduced to &s;uch
Weakne&s;s, by frequent Child-bearing, that
&s;he was not able to receive the Embraces of
her Lord without the utmo&s;t Extremity of
Pain and Di&s;order; and it went &s;o far, that
&s;he was <HI>at la&s;t</HI> obliged to di&s;cover it to him,
but did it with &s;o much Mode&s;ty and Goodne&s;s,
that &s;he offered him to con&s;ent to his tak|ing
any other Lady, which he might approve
of to &s;upply her Place.</P>
<P>SHE in&s;i&s;ted upon the rea&s;onablene&s;s of
it, and that &s;he believed her con&s;enting to it,
and from &s;uch evident nece&s;&s;ity, might make
it lawful; nay, &s;he pre&s;s'd the Prince to it
very earne&s;tly, offering her &s;elf to find out
an agreeable Per&s;on for him, and to bring
her to him.</P>
<P>THE generous Prince received her fir&s;t De|claration;
intimating her own Weakne&s;s and
<PB N="87" REF="103">
Infirmity, with a concern of Pity and Af|fection
as became a tender Husband, which
he always had been to her, and a&s;&s;ured her
he would not oppre&s;s her, or offer any thing
to injure or di&s;order her. He &s;miled at her
Propo&s;al, but told her, No; &s;ince Providence
had thought fit to deny him the &s;atisfaction
he u&s;ed to have in the Embraces of his own
Wife, he hoped he was &s;o much of a Chri|&s;tian
as not to break GoD's Laws to gratify
natural De&s;ires; and that he had &s;o much
the Government of him&s;elf al&s;o as not to
let his Appetite get the Ma&s;tery of his Rea|&s;on;
and with this noble Re&s;olution declined
the Offer his Wife made him of another
Lady, and kept him&s;elf &s;ingle, <HI>as it may be
called,</HI> to the lady la&s;t.</P>
<P>I give this, among many Examples, wherein
conjugal Mode&s;ty has been pre&s;erved, and the
Example is moving. The Prince I mention
was in the highth of his Strength, the prime
of his Age, between the Age of thirty and
forty; &s;trong, vigorous, full of Fire in the
Field, and, in proportion, el&s;ewhere; the
Thing was an Accident, and to Nature was
doubtle&s;s a Di&s;appointment; but the Chri&s;tian
prevailed above the Youth; Rea&s;on conquered
Nature, and that Rea&s;on had the Government of
all his Inclinations.</P>
<P>CERTAINLY we are to act according to our
Rea&s;on and our Under&s;tanding in all Ca&s;es,
where the Laws either of GOD or Man leave
us at liberty; nay, tho&s;e Laws &s;eeming to
leave us at full liberty, give the &s;tronger Force
to the Government of our Rea&s;on; They
&s;eem not to &s;ay you are in this le&s;t to what
your own Will directs, but the Language of the
<PB N="88" REF="104">
Law of Nature it &s;elf, and of the &s;ub&s;equent
Laws of GOD in the &s;ame Ca&s;e is. Here you
are le&s;t to act as Rea&s;on and Religion &s;hall di|rect,
and as the Circum&s;tances that may hap|pen
&s;hall make rea&s;onable.</P>
<P>THE Exce&s;&s;es and Extremes of our Pa&s;&s;ions
are in almo&s;t all Ca&s;es the &s;candal of the
rational Life, the principal Cau&s;e of which
is, becau&s;e Rea&s;on is given to Man as a guard
to him again&s;t all the Exorbitances of Nature.
Rea&s;on is the Rule of Life to a Man, as Religi|on
is to Chri&s;tians; he that is not guided by
the la&s;t is an Infidel, as he that is not governed
by the fir&s;t is a Brute. 'Tis a &s;hame to a Man
that wears about him a Soul, to &s;ay, that he is
not guided by his Rea&s;on; as 'tis a &s;hame to a
Chri&s;tian to &s;ay, he is not guided by the Prin|ciples
and Dictates of Religion.</P>
<P>AS Rea&s;on therefore is our guide in Matters
&s;ubjected to its Laws, &s;o in this more particularly,
namely, in governing and directing our Affec|tions,
our Appetites, our Pa&s;&s;ions, and our De&s;ires:
Take it in more indifferent and ordinary Ca&s;es,
we are allowed to Eat and Drink, GOD gave
the Ble&s;&s;ings and Encrea&s;e of the Field to Man;
He is, under his Maker, the Lord of the
World, and he is left at full liberty not only
to &s;upply his Nece&s;&s;ity, his Hunger and Thir&s;t,
but he is at liberty to &s;olace him&s;elf with his
Food, and eat or drink what is mo&s;t agreeable
to his Palate: But as Rea&s;on is the guide of his
Appetite, &s;o far as to direct him how much to
eat or drink upon all Occa&s;ions, &s;o he that
gorges him&s;elf beyond what is rea&s;onable, ex|po&s;es
him&s;elf to the ju&s;t Cen&s;ure of a brutal
Appetite; thus, in all <HI>other Ca&s;es,</HI> a Man out
<PB N="89" REF="105">
of the government of his Rea&s;on is, in a word,
a Mon&s;ter rather than a Man.</P>
<P>METHINKS the mode&s;t Reader may take this
as it is intended, <HI>viz.</HI> to extend to the Exerci&s;e of
a brutal ungoverned Appetite, in any other Ca&s;e,
to which this of eating and drinking is appo&s;ite,
and may apply it &s;uitably, though Decency
forbids me to do it.</P>
<P>WE &s;hould all blu&s;h to be told, in other Ca&s;es,
that we had no Government of our &s;elves; that
we were in&s;atiably Covetous, or unboundedly
Ambitious, or Vain, and much more &s;hould
we have rea&s;on to blu&s;h, as being in&s;atiable in
any other Appetite.</P>
<P>DECENCY al&s;o puts another Difficulty upon
me here, <HI>viz.</HI> it obliges me to &s;peak of this
Article, as if the Man was the only guilty Per|&s;on,
and that the Mode&s;ty of the Woman was
a &s;ufficient re&s;traint to her upon all Occa&s;ions:
Nor will I make &s;o much as an attempt in Pre|judice
of that Charity; if it happen otherwi&s;e
on any Occa&s;ion 'tis &s;o much the wor&s;e, be|cau&s;e,
I think, of the two, the Extream on
that Side is the mo&s;t fatal, as well as &s;hame|ful.</P>
<P>THERE is a Part of this Circum&s;tance, which,
as it is nece&s;&s;ary to be mentioned, &s;o it may
be mentioned without Offence, tho' it regards
even the nice&s;t Branch of the Argument; and
that is, How fatal this Exorbitance is, when it
meets, not as it were in a kind of Conjunction,
as where neither the Man or the Woman have
the Government of them&s;elves; but where the
Extream is on one Side only, with a coldne&s;s
and indifferency equally extream on the other;
I &s;ay, this may be mentioned without offence,
becau&s;e it mu&s;t not be deny'd but there is an
<PB N="90" REF="106">
Error both ways, of which Rea&s;on as well as
Duty and Affection, are to be the Directors
and Guides: It is, no doubt, a Duty on
both Sides to yield, to plea&s;e, and oblige
one another, where no ju&s;t Objections are to be
made; and tho&s;e Husbands or Wives who de|cline
one another criminally, ought to con&s;ider
the matrimonial Vow and Duty in all its Par|ticulars;
but e&s;pecially upon the ill Con&s;e|quences
which &s;uch a Coldne&s;s may produce;
which, though not ju&s;tiable at all in the Per|&s;on
that may &s;o fly out, yet 'tis what we ought
to avoid, as we are not to lead one another into
Temptations; and this is one of the Things
which, as I &s;aid, tho&s;e Courts of particular Ju&s;|tice
take cogni&s;ance of among the <HI>Turks.</HI> But
of this more at large in its Order. I am now
chiefly talking of the Extreams of the fir&s;t
kind, and of an unre&s;trained Brutality.</P>
<P>I bury all the hate&s;ul Particulars which the&s;e
Reproofs are pointed at, in the re&s;pect I pre|&s;erve
for decency of Expre&s;&s;ion; and conclude
with &s;aying, that tho&s;e Branches of conjugal
Di&s;order are the &s;candal of the Marriage Bed;
every Chri&s;tian, as well as every prudent
and wi&s;e Man, will be a&s;hamed, to think he
&s;hould want a hint to re&s;train him&s;elf. As to
the brutal World; Men and Women who give
a loo&s;e to their De&s;ires, of whatever kind, and
hate all Mortifications; who de&s;pi&s;e Reftraint
and Rules; that &s;corn to think they want Ad|vice,
and are above Reproof; I have one Hint
more for &s;uch, and that is this, let them go on and
act with a full Gu&s;t; let them &s;train Nature to the
utmo&s;t; and let them &s;ee whether if the Laws of
GOD or Man do not re&s;train them or puni&s;h
them, Nature her &s;elf will not complain, openly
<PB N="91" REF="107">
expo&s;e them, and make them confe&s;s the Crime
when it is to be read in their Puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>WHENCE come Pal&s;ies and Epilep&s;ies, Fal|ling-Sickne&s;s,
trembling of the Joints, pale
dejected A&s;pects, Leanne&s;s, and at la&s;t Rotten|ne&s;s,
and other filthy and loath&s;ome Diftem|pers,
but from the criminal Exce&s;&s;es of their
younger times? 'Tis not enough to &s;ay that it
was lawful, and they made u&s;e of none but their
own Wives; the natural Cour&s;e of things go on
their own way; Nature's Streams flow all in the
&s;ame Channels; if the Fountain is drawn dry, if
the Vitals are exhau&s;ted, the Engines of Nature
worked with unrea&s;onable Violence, the Parts
feel the &s;ame unrea&s;onable Force, and the Con|&s;equences
will be the &s;ame, whether the Facts
were juftifiable, and lawful in them&s;elves or not.</P>
<P>THUS, as above, 'tis lawful to eat and drink;
and the Kinds and Quantities of Food which
we are to eat are perfectly left to our own Di&s;|cretion;
nay, we are left, as I have &s;aid, even
to regale and divert our &s;elves both with Eat|ing
and Drinking. But the Epicure, who gives
him&s;elf all manner of Liberties, that gives a
loo&s;e to the gu&s;t of his Appetite, that gorges
his Stomach with rich Sauces and &s;urfeiting
Dainties, that rather devours than feeds upon
what is before him, and knows no Bounds to
his eating but the meer mathematical Dimen|&s;ions
of his Bowels: What comes of him?
He &s;wells up with Fat, is over-run with Rheums,
Catarrhs, and all &s;corbutick Di&s;tempers, and at
la&s;t finks under the Weight of his own Bulk,
is choaked with the very Food he eats, and dies
in the middle of his dainty Meats: and the
Drunkard, gorged with Wine, does the &s;ame.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="108">
THUS they de&s;troy them&s;elves in the u&s;e of
lawful Things, or, if you plea&s;e, in the abu&s;e
of them; and while they plea&s;e them&s;elves
with having been doing nothing but what it
was lawful to do, they peri&s;h in the Exce&s;&s;es of
it, and murther them&s;elves by the unlawful
doing of lawful Actions.</P>
<P>IN the &s;ame manner, tho&s;e Men who pretend
there are no limitations of Mode&s;ty between
a Man and his Wife, that their Rea&s;on is
not needful to be called in to the Government
of their Appetite, but that they are at liberty
to act in all Things as meer ungoverned Na|ture,
however vitiated, &s;hall direct. What Ef|fects
do they ordinarily find of it, and where
does it end? How do we find them loaded with
Di&s;ea&s;es, contract early Infirmities? How does
exhau&s;ted Nature &s;eel the &s;ecret Defects, and
how hard do they find it to recover the Vigour
and Strength which they have pu&s;h'd to the ut|mo&s;t,
in a thoughtle&s;s Exce&s;s?</P>
<P>NAY, How often does the boiling Blood fer|ment
into Fevers, Ulcers, and the mo&s;t incura|ble
Di&s;ea&s;es? How do the vital Parts feel the
Wound, till the Dart &s;trike through the Liver,
as <HI>Solomon</HI> mo&s;t excellently de&s;cribes it; and the
di&s;mal Con&s;equences &s;eldom End but in the
Grave? Nor is that all, but the tottering Head,
the Rheums, Catarrhs, the Fluxes, Inflamma|tions,
and all the fatal Con&s;equences of an un|governed
vitiated Youth, how often and generally
do they appear &s;o openly, that'tis ea&s;y, e&s;pecially
to Men of Judgment, to read the Cau&s;e in the
Con&s;equences, the Sin in the Puni&s;hments
nay, &s;ome will tell you, that even the foul Di&s;|ea&s;e
it &s;elf, has been the Effect of immoderate
Heats and Surfeitings of the Blood, without
<PB N="93" REF="109">
what we call Contamination or Infection from
others, and where none other has been con|cerned
but the Man and his Wife &s;ingly and
alone.</P>
<P>IF I were at liberty to explain my&s;elf upon
this nau&s;eous Subject, I could, from clear and
rational Con&s;equences, convince the ungoverned
Criminal, how he lays the Foundation of the ruin
of his Conftitution, how he poi&s;ons his Blood, and
&s;preads the corrupt Seeds of Di&s;ea&s;e into the very
Veins of his Po&s;terity; but the Occa&s;ion is too foul
for my Pen: Let it &s;uffice to admoni&s;h Chriftians,
and Men of Sen&s;e, that they &s;hould remember
they are &s;o; that they have rea&s;oning Pow|ers
to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in &s;ubduing their inordinate
Heats; that they &s;hould &s;ummon Virtue and
Mode&s;ty, Rea&s;on and Chriftianity to their aid,
and act in all Things agreeable to rea&s;onable
Beings, not like enraged Lunaticks, though
they are not under the re&s;traint of Laws.</P>
<P>THEY are greatly mi&s;taken likewi&s;e who
expect I &s;hould give Rules here, and pre&s;cribe to
them what I mean by Modefty and Moderation
in &s;uch Things as the&s;e; in &s;hort, &s;uch would
plea&s;e them&s;elves if they could bring me to
enter into Particulars of any kind, on one Side
or other, for they love to dwell upon the Story.
But <HI>Verb. Sap. Sat.</HI> 'Tis enough; I have pointed

the Bounds are ea&s;ily pre&s;cribed, &s;o as a

<HI>as follows,</HI> namely,</P>

upon the &s;olemn Engagement, and
upon the Weight and Significance of the Obli|gation
on both Sides, how firm the Bond, how
indi&s;&s;olvible the mutual Ties, and how impor|tant
to the Felicity of Life it is that they &s;hould
be religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>I know too well who I am talking to, and
at what Time of Day; how the Subordina|tion
<PB N="96" REF="112">
of one Sex is laughed at and bantered, and
the Dominion of the other abu&s;ed and turned
into Tyranny, and Oppre&s;&s;ion; how the Wo|men,
in&s;tead of Submi&s;&s;ion, reign; and the Men,
in&s;tead of a Government in Love, and a &s;upe|riority
of Affection, in which that Government
&s;hould chiefly con&s;i&s;t, in&s;ult and oppre&s;s their
Wives; how the Obligation of for&s;aking all
other, is ridiculed and made a Je&s;t of, and that
of keeping your &s;elf only unto her, declared
to be a meer Church Impo&s;ition, a Piece of
Prie&s;tcraft, and unrea&s;onable.</P>
<P>Do you think, &s;ays blu&s;hing <HI>G</HI>&mdash;, to his
poor &s;ubjected but mode&s;t Wife, Do you think
that ever I intended to meddle with no more
than one Woman? No, no, I never promis'd
any &s;uch Thing; if I did I never intended to
keep to it, then he turns and &s;ings a &s;candalous
Song out of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> too gro&s;s to repeat:
<Q><L>But to live with her all a Man's Life,</L>
<L>Till &s;he grows&mdash;</L>
<L>Good faith, <HI>Mr. Par&s;on,</HI> I thank you for that,</L>
<L>I thank ye for that.</L></Q></P>
<P>AND whence comes this Contempt? I &s;ay,
it does not proceed &s;o much from the Wicked|ne&s;s,
as from the Ignorance of the Age; Ig|norance
of the real Felicity of their very Kind;
how all that can be called happy in the Life of
Man, is &s;umm'd up in the &s;tate of Marriage;
that it is the Center to which all the le&s;&s;er De|lights
of Life tend, as a Point in the Circle;
that, in &s;hort, all the extraordinary Enjoy|ments
of Life are temporary and trifling, and
con&s;i&s;t chiefly in the &s;trange and uncouth Plea|&s;ure
<PB N="97" REF="113">
which, &s;ome Men &s;ay, they find in doing
what they ought not to do; which, at be&s;t, la&s;ts
but till they are wi&s;e, and learn to know what
it is to repent. But the Plea&s;ure of a married
State con&s;i&s;ts wholly in the Beauty of the Union,
the &s;haring Comforts, the doubling all Enjoy|ments;
'tis the Settlement of Life; the Ship is
always in a Storm till it finds this &s;afe Road,
and here it comes to an Anchor: 'Tis the want
of a ta&s;te of Life makes Men de&s;pi&s;e that Part of
it which Heaven at fir&s;t con&s;tituted to compleat
the Happine&s;s of his Creatures.</P>
<P>TO argue again&s;t Marriage, becau&s;e &s;o many
Matches are unhappy, and &s;o few exemplify the
Ca&s;e as it ought to be, is only arguing the Ignorance
and Corruption of Mankind, which as it is the
Cau&s;e, &s;o it is fully di&s;covered by this unhappy
Con&s;equence. Did Men expect Happine&s;s in a
married Condition, they would Begin and End
it after another manner, prepare for it before|hand
with more nicety, and take much great|er
Thought about it before they engaged in
it.</P>
<P>POLITICK Matches are Weddings for Prin|ces,
and for Per&s;ons of high Birth, where the
meer Intere&s;ts of the Families are the Con&s;ide|ration
of the Alliance, and where it is not e&s;|&s;ential
to the Match, whether the Per&s;ons love
one another or no, at lea&s;t not &s;o e&s;&s;ential as in
Per&s;ons of a meaner degree.</P>
<P>BUT as the Per&s;ons of a lower Station are,
generally &s;peaking, much more happy in their
Marrriages, than Princes and Per&s;ons of Di&s;tin|ction;
&s;o I take much of it, if not all of it, to
con&s;i&s;t in the Advantage they have to choo&s;e
and refu&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="114">
MARRIAGES of Princes and Per&s;ons of
Rank, are rather Leagues and Treaties of Al|liance
and Confederacy than Weddings, and
they are tran&s;acted accordingly; the Lady is
courted at a Di&s;tance, viewed in Effigy by her
Picture &s;et with Diamonds, contracted by En|voys
Extraordinary, married by Proxy, and
then travels a thou&s;and Miles perhaps, or
&s;omething le&s;s, to find out her Husband.</P>
<P>THUS indeed <HI>Abraham</HI> &s;ent the Steward of
his Hou&s;hold to fetch his Son <HI>I&s;aac</HI> a Wife, a|bout
three or four hundred Miles off, and &s;he
came with the Me&s;&s;enger: But the Ca&s;e was
plain there; <HI>Rebecca</HI> &s;aw the vi&s;ible Finger of
GOD in it, and the Words of <HI>Laban</HI> her Bro|ther,
though him&s;elf an Idolater, confe&s;&s;ed it,
<HI>Gen.</HI> xxiv. 50. <HI>then Laban and Bethuel an&s;wered,
and &s;aid, the thing proceedeth from the</HI> LORD,
<HI>we cannot &s;peak unto thee bad or good;</HI> and upon
this Foundation the Lady ventured to go with
the Me&s;&s;enger.</P>
<P>BUT yet even <HI>Rebeccah</HI> her&s;elf, when &s;he
acted the like Part for her Son, and de&s;ired to
take a Wife for <HI>Jacob</HI> from the &s;ame Country;
&s;he &s;ent no Servant of the Errand, but made
him go in Per&s;on, and choo&s;e for him&s;elf, and
he did &s;o, and pitched upon his well-favoured
beautiful <HI>Rachel,</HI> had not <HI>Laban</HI> cheated him,
and laid a blear-eyed <HI>Lea</HI> in her Place.</P>
<P>AS Marriage is a &s;tate of Life in which &s;o
much of humane Felicity is really placed, and
in which Men may be &s;o compleatly happy or
mi&s;erable, it &s;eems to me the mo&s;t rational
thing in the World, that the Parties them&s;elves,
and them alone, &s;hould give the la&s;t Strokes to
its Conclu&s;ion; that they only &s;hould be left to
determine it, and that with all po&s;&s;ible Freedom,
<PB N="99" REF="115">
that they might be able to &s;ay to one another,
and that with the utmo&s;t Sincerity, at reciting
the Office of Matrimony, not <HI>I take thee,</HI> but <HI>I
choo&s;e thee;</HI> thou art my Choice; that the Man
may be able &s;ay, not only &s;he is the Wife of
my Youth, but &s;he is the Wife of my Affection;
and the Woman the &s;ame.</P>
<P>HOW little is this which is the e&s;&s;ential Part
under&s;tood in the World, how little of Love
is there to be found in Matrimony, as 'tis now
managed; and what is the Con&s;equence but un|faithful
performing the Marriage Convenants;
di&s;loyalty, breach of Faith and Honour, and
the wor&s;t Sort of Perjury on both Sides? for as
the Marriage Covenant is a &s;olemn of all Engagements
upon Earth, &s;o breaking it is the wor&s;t of Per|jury,
and ought indeed to be puni&s;hed as
&s;uch.</P>
<P>WHERE there is no Pre-engagement of the
Affection before Marriage, what can be ex|pected
after it? And what do we find comes
after it, but <HI>at be&s;t</HI> continued Jars, Quarrel|lings,
Scolding, and perhaps Fighting? never
to be abated, never to be altered, no not by
length of Time, not forty Years wedlock has
been &s;ufficient to tire out the jangling, ill|matched
Tempers; but the Evil takes Root
with Time, till the Hatred grows riveted, and
becomes natural, they even die with the per|petual
Di&s;gu&s;t upon them, and carry their
Feuds, as it were, along with them to the
Grave, as if they re&s;olved to renew the Strife
in the next World.</P>
<P>IT was a mi&s;erable Example of this which a
near Relation of mine was an Eye-witne&s;s to in
the Town of <HI>Sherborn</HI> in <HI>Dor&s;ct&s;hire,</HI> or very
<PB N="100" REF="116">
near it. A Man and his Wife had lived a
wretched, continued Life of Contention for
almo&s;t fifty Years; at length the Woman fell
&s;ick and died; while &s;he lay on her Death-bed
her Husband came up into the Chamber to &s;ee
her, as a good Husband ought; the Woman
fretful, though &s;ick, found fault with him upon
&s;ome Occa&s;ion of no great moment, and grew
angry. Pray, my Dear, &s;ays the Man, don't
quarrel to your la&s;t Moment. The Woman
flew into a Pa&s;&s;ion that he &s;hould &s;ugge&s;t it
was her la&s;t Moment, which, &s;he &s;aid, <HI>he did
not know.</HI> This put the Man into a Pa&s;&s;ion too,
and he &s;aid, <HI>ra&s;hly enough,</HI> that if it was not
her la&s;t Moment he wi&s;hed it was, or it would
be happy for him if it was, or to that purpo&s;e.
What! &s;ays &s;he, do you In&s;ult me with that,
depend upon it you &s;hall be at no Quiet on that
Account, for if ever the Dead can come to the
Quick, I'll be with thee again.</P>
<P>WHETHER &s;he kept her Word with him or
no, I know not; but 'tis certain &s;he died in
two or three Days after, nor did the Man ven|ture
to go up to vi&s;it her any more. This was
indeed carrying on what we may call an eternal
Feud, it was a mortal Breach indeed, for no|thing
ever cur'd it, and yet the Couple were
not &s;o exa&s;perated again&s;t one another, but that
they lived together, were People of good Sub|&s;tance,
and &s;ome Sen&s;e, and even too much
Wit; but married, it &s;eems, without the grand
con&s;tituting Article called mutual Affection,
which is indeed, in my Opinion, the e&s;&s;ential
Part of the Contract; the Woman profe&s;s'd &s;he
never loved him, and yet &s;he married him; the
Man declared he never asked her to love him,
or cared one Farthing whether &s;he did or no,
<PB N="101" REF="117">
&s;o he had but her Money, which was, it &s;eems,
what he took her for. Now, was this Matrimony?
No, no, it might be Marriage, but I deny that
it was Matrimony; here was nothing of <HI>GOD's
holy Ordinance,</HI> or taking one another according
to that Ordinance; it was all a contradiction of
the main De&s;ign; in &s;hort, it was a &s;omething
that wants a Name; and what can be &s;aid to
contradict me if I &s;hould call it a <HI>Matrimonial
Whoredom?</HI></P>
<P>WELL might this Couple an&s;wer or &s;ay after
the Par&s;on, I <HI>N.</HI> TAKE thee <HI>N.</HI> But they could
never have been married if the Office had run,
I <HI>N.</HI> choo&s;e thee <HI>N.</HI> out of my &s;incere Affection
to thee, and for that Rea&s;on take thee, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> What
would have become of us all if this had been
the &s;olemn Part or Oath of the Marriage Co|venant,
and that it had been taken upon Pain of
Perjury? How few are there that would dare to
be married upon that Foot?</P>
<P>SOME are of the Opinion, prudential Match|es,
as they call them, are be&s;t. They tell us,
'tis the Parents bu&s;ine&s;s to choo&s;e Wives for
their Sons, and Husbands for their Daughters;
that let them be tied together fir&s;t, they will
toy together till they love afterwards; that Pro|perty
begets Affection, and that if all other
Things hit, they may run the ri&s;que of the
Love with le&s;s incovenience.</P>
<P>BUT I mu&s;t enter my Prote&s;t here: I think
they that make a Toy of the Affection, will make
a Toy of the Matrimony; they &s;eem to know
little of the Mi&s;ery of tho&s;e Matches who
think they are to be toyed into Love after Con|&s;ummation:
how often are they cloyed with
one another's Company before the Affection
comes in? How little Force has the &s;port of Mar|riage,
<PB N="102" REF="118">
(&s;o a wi&s;e Favourer of tho&s;e prudential
Matches was plea&s;ed to call it) in to contract
Affection? I have &s;een enough of it, to make
me venture &s;aying, there is not One in Ten of
tho&s;e Kinds of Marriages that &s;ucceeds.</P>
<P>NOR is the Surface-Love, which takes &s;o
much in the World at this time, any part of
the pure, the &s;olid, the rivetted Affection,
which, I in&s;i&s;t, is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the Felicity
of a married Life. Where is the Union of the
whole De&s;ire, or even of the Soul of De&s;ire,
that which Mr. Milton &s;o very nobly expatiates
upon from <HI>Adams,</HI> Words, <HI>They &s;hall be one Fle&s;h,</HI>
Gen. xi. 24.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;And they &s;hall be one Fle&s;h, one Heart, one Soul.&endq;</Q>
Is this to be obtained after Marriage, and that
Marriage made perhaps by the choice and at the
imperious arbitrary Command of Superiors?
If not, as indeed I think it not rational to
imagine, is it &s;o &s;light a Matter, and of &s;o
little Con&s;equence, as that Matrimony &s;hould
be ventured on without a due Provi&s;ion for &s;uch
a Union? Certainly, if any Action of Life is
of Con&s;equence, 'tis that which determines the
Man for Happine&s;s or Mi&s;ery: And &s;uch is
this of Matrimony; for I think I may affirm,
Marriage without Love, is the compleate&s;t
Mi&s;ery in Life. Be&s;ides, I mu&s;t &s;ay, it is to
me utterly unlawful, and entails a Cur&s;e upon
the Per&s;ons, as being wilfully perjured, invok|ing
the Name of GOD to a Fal&s;hood, which is
one of the mo&s;t provoking Crimes that Mankind
can commit. He or &s;he who, with that &s;light
and &s;uperficial Affection, ventures into the ma|trimonial
Vow, are to me little more than legal
<PB N="103" REF="119">
Pro&s;titutes: Political Views may make a Mar|riage,
but, in the Sen&s;e of God and Nature,
'tis my Opinion they make no Matrimony.</P>
<P>NOR does all this out&s;ide, skin-deep Affec|tion,
which &s;uch Matches at fir&s;t appear with,
protect them again&s;t the Deficiencies of their
own Tempers, and the Eruptions of their Pa&s;|&s;ion;
it fortifies none again&s;t Family-Breach|es,
&s;upplies no Forces again&s;t the Attacks of
the Pa&s;&s;ions, and the Unkindne&s;&s;es which in|numerable
Circum&s;tances introduce in the &s;ub|&s;equent
Conduct of both Parties.</P>
<P>THESE Matches indeed generally produce a
great &s;how of Affection, and the Fondne&s;s of
the Honey-Moon hangs about them a great
while, on &s;ome more, &s;ome le&s;s. This I call
the Pageantry of Matrimony, and the Caval|cade
of Love. But the Strife breaks out in&s;en|&s;ibly;
the Contention, the Contradiction, and
all the little Thwartings and Wa&s;pi&s;hne&s;&s;es,
which lay the Foundation of eternal Di&s;cord;
the&s;e all, like Weeds, grow and &s;pread under
the decaying Plant called Love, till at la&s;t they
check and &s;mother it entirely, and leave the
Family a kind of Hell in Miniature.</P>
<P>A late Poet expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf upon this Sub|ject
with great Elegancy and Affluence of
Wit; whether he &s;pake feelingly or not, I
cannot &s;ay:</P>
<LG>
<L>Thus a &s;eeming happy Pair,</L>
<L>Who <HI>Hymen</HI>'s early Fetters wear;</L>
<L>In Publick fond as Turtles are.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The unwed with Envy their Care&s;&s;es view,</L>
<L>But, Oh! what would the amaz'd Beholders do?</L>
<L>If as they &s;ee their open Loves, their private</L>
<L>Feuds they knew.</L>
</LG>
<P><PB N="104" REF="120">
AND whence proceeds all this, and ten
thou&s;and times more than Heart can conceive,
or Pen &s;et down, but from the want of a &s;in|cere
rivetted Affection between them before
Matrimony? The Man that marries without it
mu&s;t be a Knave; the Woman that marries
without it mu&s;t be a Fool; and let me not give
hard Words neither, without a &s;ufficient Au|thority
for it; but I'll make it out immedi|ately.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, that Man mu&s;t be <HI>a Knave:</HI> No hone&s;t
Man will promi&s;e and engage, nay, &s;wear to
do a Thing, which he is fully re&s;olved not to
do; or which he is not &s;ure he is able to per|form,
and does not &s;incerely intend to per|form.</P>
<P>IN the Terms of the Marriage Vow, the Mi|ni&s;ter
asks the Man the&s;e conci&s;e Que&s;tions:</P>
<P><HI>Wilt thou</HI> have this Woman to be thy wedded
<HI>Wife?</HI> He an&s;wers, <HI>I Will.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wilt thou</HI> love her? <HI>I Will.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wilt thou</HI> live with her? <HI>I Will.</HI></P>
<P>THE Interrogation <HI>Wilt thou,</HI> is under&s;tood as
much as if the Mini&s;ter repeated it every time;
and though he an&s;wers with but one <HI>I Will,</HI> 'tis
as effectually under&s;tood to mean a particular
An&s;wer to every Interrogation, as if it was
repeated to them all, and the meaning is the
&s;ame; the Man can by no means come off of
it; no, nor the Woman either, for her Engage|ment
is equally firm and binding.</P>
<P>THIS <HI>I Will</HI> is not only a Promi&s;e obligatory,
a &s;olemn Engagement and Vow, but 'tis done
under the Sanction of Religion, and of an Or|dinance
of GOD; it is a &s;acred Oath, 'tis what
the Scripture calls the <HI>Oath of</HI> GOD, and the
married Man may ju&s;tly &s;ay, the <HI>Oath of</HI> GOD
<PB N="105" REF="121">
is upon him; in &s;hort, every time he &s;ays, <HI>I

as to &s;ay, BY GOD I WILL. He that
takes this &s;olemn Oath, without being &s;ure he
can &s;incerely love the Woman, and &s;o perform
the Oath, mu&s;t be a Knave, he cannot be an
hone&s;t Man; And how can he be certain, if he
did not really and &s;incerely love her before? I
think the Ca&s;e is plain, and an&s;wers for it
&s;elf.</P>
<P>AGAIN, take the Woman's Obligation; her
An&s;wers are the &s;ame to Que&s;tions not much
differing; and when the Que&s;tions are &s;umm'd
up, (I need not repeat them here) &s;he an&s;wers,
and &s;ays, or, if you will, &s;he an&s;wers and
&s;wears, as above,
<Q>I Will.</Q></P>
<P>YOU will! What will you do, Madam? Will
you live with a Man, and lie with a Man you
don't love? As I &s;aid before, that &s;uch a Lady
mu&s;t be <HI>a Fool,</HI> I &s;ay now 'tis wor&s;e; 'tis but a
kind of legal Pro&s;titution, in the plain <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
of it, too gro&s;s and wicked to expre&s;s. We mu&s;t
not &s;ay &s;he is a <HI>Whore,</HI> becau&s;e the Law makes it
a literal Contract and Marriage. But GOD forbid
I &s;hould ever &s;ay 'twill pa&s;s for Matrimony in
Heaven; the young Lady, in &s;hort, is willing, or
has a mind, or de&s;ires, (call it what you plea&s;e)
to lie with a Man; and &s;he takes a Fellow that
is ju&s;t in the &s;ame Condition, under the In|fluence
of &s;ome lewd Appetite, and he de&s;ires
to lie with a Woman. They are both willing
to gratify their vitious Part in the formality
of a legal Appointment, and &s;o they agree to
marry in form, and they are called Man and
Wife; as &s;uch &s;he throws off the Mask of
Motle&s;uy, goes into the raked Bed to him, or

and Wantonne&s;&s;es, mentioned or pointed at

not a Grain of original, cha&s;t, and ri|vetted
Love, the Glory of a Chri&s;tian Matri|mony,
and the e&s;&s;ential Happine&s;s of Life, is
to be found between them.</P>
<P>IS this Matrimony! Is this a Marriage made
in Heaven! Is this being joined together ac|cording
to GOD's holy Ordinance! Forbid it,
O Heaven! that I &s;hould call it by that honou|rable
and religious Title: On the contrary, it
merits, if I may be allowed to give my Judg|ment,
nothing le&s;s or more than the Title of a
Matrimonial Whoredom, or, at lea&s;t, of a Ma|trimonial
Pro&s;titution.</P>
<P>IT would make a Story too long for the pre|&s;ent
Work, and a little too gro&s;s for my re&s;ol|ved
Way of writing; if I &s;hould enter into
a De&s;cription of the conjugal Conver&s;ation
of two Per&s;ons, coming together upon this

promptings of the Sexes, without any previous

or exhaled, after the Fire is out, and the com|bu&s;tible
Matter that kindled it is con&s;umed;
when the Vapour is exhaled, the airy Part
&s;pent and evaporated, and the humid Part ful|ly
conden&s;ed; how coldly they meet? How
they look at one another, as a &s;urfeited, cloyed
Stomach reli&s;hes a full-&s;pread Table? How they
nau&s;eate one another as a &s;ick Body that is

gorged with Phy&s;ick, or a con&s;umptive Per&s;on
&s;ick of his Cordials.</P>
<P>HOW their very Mirth is dull and in&s;ipid,
and they are &s;o far from diverting one another,
that their Happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts very unhappily
in being as much ab&s;ent from one another as
they can. Unwarily talking once to a Gentle|woman
of my particular Acquaintance, who&s;e
Circum&s;tances in Matrimony, tho' very good,
have yet a Defect of this kind at the Bottom.
Madam, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> you are very happy in &s;o kind
a Husband, &s;o tender, &s;o obliging; pray let us
have his Company; the Gentleman was but in
the next Room; and I was for calling him in.
<HI>Let him alone,</HI> &s;ays &s;he very coldly, <HI>let him
alone, you han't &s;o much of his Company as I
have;</HI> I had rather be without him; he would
have made any Woman in <HI>England</HI> a good Hu&s;|band
but me.</P>
<P>WHY Madam, &s;aid I, does not he make you
a good Husband? We are all of Opinion he is
an extraordinary good Husband. I don't know,
<HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> it may be I an't &s;o good a Wife as I
&s;hould be. O Madam, &s;aid I, don't &s;ay &s;o; I
believe you are a very good Wife. Indeed,
&s;ays &s;he, I an't &s;o good a Wife as I &s;hould be;
we married young, and the main Ingredient was
wanting: We did as we were bid, but we were
never troubled much with the Thing called
LOVE; and I find, by &s;ad Experience, Wed|lock
is a mi&s;erable Thing without it.</P>
<P>WHY, Madam, &s;ays I, your Circum&s;tances
are good, and you live very ea&s;y on both Sides.</P>
<P>THAT'S true, &s;aid &s;he; but I tell you, the
main Ingredient is wanting. I never lov'd
him; and I always thought he never could
love me; for indeed, I never did go about to
<PB N="108" REF="124">
oblige him, becau&s;e I had never any real Value
for him.</P>
<P>THAT'S a very unhappy Ca&s;e indeed, Ma|dam,
&s;aid I.</P>
<P>SO unhappy, &s;ays &s;he, that I would never
advi&s;e any Body to marry without they know
on both Sides, how things &s;tand as to Love;
for 'tis all nothing but a Banter to talk of Hap|pine&s;s
without it; they that don't love before
they marry, will never be happy when they
are married.</P>
<P>BUT, Madam, you have been long married,
&s;aid I; methinks kind and good U&s;age on both
Sides &s;hould have made Love by this time.</P>
<P>I don't know how it may do in other Folks,
<HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> but 'tis not &s;o with me; Mr. <HI>W</HI>&mdash;is
as kind and tender of me as I can de&s;ire, and
yet I don't know what ails me, I never did,
and I never can love him; it won't do; I
would advi&s;e no Body to marry before they
Love; let them depend upon it, if they don't
Love before-hand they will never love after|ward;
it is not to be done; I have found it by
&s;ad Experience.</P>
<P>WHY, Madam, &s;ays I, the World thinks
you are a mighty happy Couple.</P>
<P>WHY then we have cheated the World, <HI>&s;ays
&s;he,</HI> as we did one another; for, I can a&s;&s;ure
you, as I &s;peak to you in Confidence, we are a
very unhappy Couple.</P>
<P>WHY, Madam, you don't Quarrel, <HI>&s;ays I.</HI></P>
<P>NO, &s;ays &s;he, never; good Manners, and good
Breeding keep us from that: But what are all
tho&s;e Negatives to make a Couple happy?
There's no Happine&s;s without Love, and that
on both Sides. Oh! &s;ays &s;he with a Sigh, and
&s;o concluded the Di&s;cour&s;e, let no Body marry
and come together without Love; 'tis nothing
<PB N="109" REF="125">
but what is not fit to name without it; 'tis all
&s;candalous and &s;hameful; and &s;o we called up
other Di&s;cour&s;e; for I had enough of it, and
the Lady fell into Tears, and yet &s;he confe&s;s'd
all the Fault was her own too.</P>
<P>AND what generally &s;peaking is the End of
&s;uch prepo&s;terous Conjunctions as this was,
but a Birth of Mon&s;ters? Pardon me, I don't
mean that the Children born between them
&s;hall be Mon&s;ters in &s;hape, imperfect, unfi|ni&s;h'd,
wanting their Limbs, or with more
Limbs than Nature directs, as in many mon|&s;trous
Births is the Ca&s;e; though I could &s;ay
&s;ome pertinent Things upon that Subject too,
if the Age could bear it: But my meaning is,
the&s;e Conjunctions generally break out in
mon&s;trous Con&s;equences; Family Confu|&s;ions,
violent Contentions, un&s;ufferable Pa&s;|&s;ions,
raging at one another in vile Lan|guage,
Quarrels, Feuds, Fightings, or at
lea&s;t In&s;ultings of one another; in all which
they act Furious, as in their original Gu&s;ts of
another kind, reproaching them&s;elves with that
very criminal Part which brought them toge|ther,
upbraiding one another with the very
Things which threw them precipitantly into
one another's Arms, from whence proceeded the
Ruin they bear. The&s;e, and a thou&s;and mon|&s;trous
Pa&s;&s;ions, ungoverned like the Fire of
their early, blind and ha&s;ty De&s;ires, are the
Effects of that prepo&s;terous Matrimony that is
contracted upon &s;uch Foundations as the&s;e.</P>
<P>HOW is it po&s;&s;ible any thing but this, or
&s;uch as this, can be the I&s;&s;ue, &s;ince when the
fir&s;t De&s;ires are gratified, Di&s;likes and Aver|&s;ions,
hateful Regret and Repentings, as na|turally
&s;ucceed &s;uch corrupt and half-born
<PB N="110" REF="126">
Love; as Hatred &s;ucceeded the &s;ame kind of
Affection in <HI>Ammon,</HI> when he had ravi&s;hed his
Si&s;ter, and which made him, <HI>as it were,</HI> kick
her down Stairs.</P>
<P>A true Affection can never be the Product of
a vitious Inclination, any more than an evil
Tree can bring forth good Fruit, 'tis contrary
to the Nature of the Work; a cha&s;t, affectionate
Embrace is quite another Thing; the one is
from Heaven formed in the Soul for the good
of Mankind, by the glorious Hand of a bene|ficent
Power, and directed for the Propagation
of a cha&s;t and virtuous Breed, fitted with in|bred
original Mode&s;ty and Principles of Virtue,
as it were, convey'd by Blood to the Honour of
the very Ordinance of Matrimony it &s;elf, and
of the primitive In&s;titution of it in Paradi&s;e:
Shall we con&s;titute a vitious or vitiated De&s;ire
in the room of Love, and a corrupt Combina|tion
of two enflamed Pieces of Pollution under
the &s;helter of legal Forms, and call this Matri|mony?
It can produce nothing but Mi&s;chief
and Confu&s;ion, the Nature of the Thing dic|tates
no other.</P>
<P>TO &s;ay Love is not e&s;&s;ential to the Form of
a Marriage, is true; but to &s;ay it is not e&s;&s;en|tial
to the Felicity of a married State, and con|&s;equently
to that which I call Matrimony, is
not true; and you may as truly &s;ay, that Peace
is not e&s;&s;ential to the good of a Family; as that
the Harmony and Conjunction of Souls are not
e&s;&s;ential to the Happine&s;s of the Per&s;ons joyn'd
together.</P>
<P>IF the Man or Woman that is to marry do
not value whether they are Happy or no, or
whether they live with the Per&s;on they are to
marry in a &s;tate of War or Peace, always Jar|ring,
<PB N="111" REF="127">
Fighting and Contending, or always
Agreeing, Uniting and Joyning in their De|&s;ires
and De&s;igns: If it is indifferent whether
they are as Doves always brooding under one
another's Wings, or <HI>Serpents</HI> hilling at and
&s;tinging one another, &s;uch may marry <HI>Blindfold,</HI>
and expect the Con&s;equences; &s;uch a Woman
may take a Man as the <HI>Sow</HI> takes the <HI>Boar</HI> in
her Sea&s;on, meerly to rai&s;e a Litter, meerly to
grati&s;y her brutal Part; and when that is gra|tify'd,
and he or &s;he perhaps &s;urfeited with the
Per&s;on, may run away to an adulterous Bar|gain
with another, for the meer gu&s;t of Vari|ety,
as is often the Ca&s;e; In &s;hort, what is
Marrying, and what is the meeting of the Sexes,
where Love and an original Affection is not
concerned? 'tis too wicked to mention, too vile
to name; to de&s;cribe it would run me into the
wor&s;t Sort of Levity; and I mu&s;t talk as vi|tiou&s;ly
as they act that do &s;o.</P>
<P>CONCEIVE of it then in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Terms
you can, in Terms &s;uited to the bea&s;tly Part,
in Terms fitted to give your Thoughts the
greate&s;t Di&s;gu&s;t, and to fill you with Dete&s;ta|tion;
for, in a word, there is nothing of De|cency
or Mode&s;ty, nothing Cha&s;t or Virtuous,
can be &s;aid about it. It is true, every Body
that does marry in this manner does not con|&s;ult
the Rea&s;on of the thing, and do not per|haps
con&s;ider what they are doing.</P>
<P>THEY do not look into the Scandal of it,
or weigh the Con&s;equences; they de&s;ire a Man;
that is indeed the Fact; 'tis in the Nature of
the Thing, and cannot be denied: But the
Lady does not con&s;ider what Con&s;equences at|tend
its being de&s;ired in &s;uch a manner; &s;he
takes the Thing as it appears; the Man offers
<PB N="112" REF="128">
to her upon honourable Terms, as they are cor|ruptly
called, that is, he will marry her; &s;he
neither enquires of her &s;elf whether he is the
Man of her Choice, whether &s;he loves him,
and upon what Rea&s;on and Foundation the
Love &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, whether upon his Per&s;on as a
Man, or his Merit as a Man of Virtue and
Sen&s;e. But &s;he ignorantly pa&s;&s;es over the&s;e
Things, and does not &s;ee that &s;he lies open to
all the Cen&s;ure, which, I &s;ay, is ju&s;tly due to
&s;uch a kind of Matrimony.</P>
<P>THIS is &s;aying as much in her Favour as
the Ca&s;e will admit, as much as indeed it is
po&s;&s;ible to &s;ay for her: But let her &s;trip the
Ca&s;e naked of all the fal&s;e Glo&s;&s;es which 'tis
perhaps covered with, and then look upon it;
or let her look into it after a Year or two,
worn out in the odd, uncouth, retrograde Wed|lock
that &s;he is engaged in, and then &s;he will
&s;ee with other Eyes; then &s;he'll &s;ee &s;he wed|ded
a worthle&s;s, &s;en&s;ele&s;s, vain and empty &s;ha|dow
of a Man, in gratification of the Humour
which &s;he was at that time in for a Bedfellow;
that &s;he has the Man, and no more, and that
now all the re&s;t is wanting; that &s;he has the
Man but not the Husband, not the Compani|on,
not the obliging, affectionate Relative that
&s;he ought to have looked for, and to have fixed
her Choice upon; and what bitter Reproaches
does &s;he load her &s;elf with when &s;he &s;ees her
&s;elf in the Arms of a Fool in&s;tead of a Man
of Sen&s;e; of a Brute and a Boar in&s;tead of a
Man of Breeding and Behayour; of a Churt
and a Fury in&s;tead of a Man of Humour and
Temper; and all this occa&s;ioned by her fol|lowing
blindly and ra&s;hly that young wanton
Inclination, which &s;he knew not how to govern.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="129">
THIS is treating the Crime with tenderne&s;s,
and the Criminal with pity, that mu&s;t be con|fe&s;s'd,
and I am very willing to do &s;o in Com|pa&s;&s;ion
to human Infirmity. But when all that
is done, I mu&s;t be allowed to &s;ay, the Fact de|&s;erves
the &s;evere&s;t Reflection, let the Ignorance
or Ra&s;hne&s;s, or whatever other Infirmity of the
Per&s;ons, be pleaded in their Excu&s;e.</P>
<P>IT may be farther &s;ugge&s;ted, that &s;ometimes
the&s;e, unhappy Con&s;equences do not follow, or,
if you plea&s;e, it is not always &s;o bad. But
this argues nothing in favour of the fal&s;e Step
taken, or the gro&s;s Conduct &s;poken of Provi|dence
may, in Compa&s;&s;ion to the Infirmities of
his Creatures, deal with them better than they
de&s;erve, and may mercifully &s;pare the Puni&s;h|ments
which they ought to expect; but this
Mercy is far from a Rea&s;on why they &s;hould
offend; on the contrary, it is the Rea&s;on why
they &s;hould not.</P>
<P>ON the other hand: Now view but the Feli|city
of a married Couple, engaged before Mar|riage,
by a mutual, a &s;incere, and well-ground|ed
Affection; who Love, and know why they do
&s;o; love upon the &s;olid Foundation of real Merit,
per&s;onal Virtue, &s;imilitude of Tempers, mu|tual
Delights; that &s;ee good Sen&s;e, good Hu|mour,
Wit, and agreeable Temper in one ano|ther,
and know it when they &s;ee it, and how
to judge of it; that make each the Object of a
reciprocal Choice, and fix all the View of their
future Felicity in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Per&s;on
&s;o loved; who&s;e Affection is founded in Ho|nour
and Virtue, their Intentions mode&s;t,
their De&s;ires cha&s;t, and their De&s;igns equally
&s;incere.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="130">
WHEN the&s;e come together, there's Matri|mony
in its Perfection; if they marry, they
can an&s;wer the Mini&s;ter, when he asks them,
Will you love him? Will you love her? The
Man can &s;ay, I will, becau&s;e I do; I will, and
&s;he is a&s;&s;ured I will; I will, for &s;he highly merits
all my Affection.</P>
<P>IT would call for a Volume, not a Page, to
de&s;cribe the Happine&s;s of this Couple. Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
does not le&s;&s;en, but highten their Enjoy|ments;
the Flame does not exhau&s;t it &s;elf by
burning, but encrea&s;es by its continuance; 'tis
young in its remote&s;t Age; Time makes no
Abatement; they are never &s;urfeited, never
&s;atiated; they enjoy all the Delights of Love
without the criminal Exce&s;&s;es; Mode&s;ty and
Decency guide their Actions, and &s;et Bounds,
not only to their Motions, but to their De|&s;ires;
and, as Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> emphatically expre&s;|&s;es
it:
<Q><L>&mdash;&startq;Shall to his Wife adhere,&endq;</L>
<L>And they &s;hall be one Fle&s;h, one Heart, one Soul.</L>
<L>Milt. Par. lib. 8. fol. 214.</L></Q></P>
<P>NOTHING criminal can creep in between,
or among the Plea&s;ures they enjoy; their De|lights
are full, yet they are cha&s;t, temperate,
con&s;tant, and, in a word, durable.</P>
<P>THEIR Children are like their Parents, as
Streams are from Fountains, formed in the
Mould of Virtue and Modefty; not Furies and
little Devils, that partake of the Rage they
were form'd in, with their Blood boiling before
it comes to the con&s;i&s;tency of its due Vigour;
but they hand down Virtue to their Po&s;terity
by the due Cour&s;e of Nature, and the Con&s;e|quence
<PB N="115" REF="131">
of due Calmne&s;s and Serenity in their
own Spirits; for it is certain, that Humour and
Temper de&s;cend in the Line of Families as
well as Di&s;ea&s;es and Di&s;temper; 'tis a ju&s;t
Encouragement to Virtue that it is &s;o, and
'tis ju&s;t to let &s;uch know it for the Encou|ragement
of their good Conduct.</P>
<P>HOW ble&s;t is the Hou&s;e where &s;uch a Couple
inhabit? and all this Difference flows meerly
from this one Branch, <HI>viz.</HI> Love before Marri|age;
Love is the con&s;tituting Quality of their
Matrimony, the Rea&s;on of it, the Foundation
on which it was built, and the Support of it
after it was built. Such Families are happy by
the meer natural Con&s;equence of Life; their
Tempers have nothing in them to form any
Di&s;cord or Strife from; they cannot Differ,
Contend; Rage, Quarrel, Reflect, Reproach,
Provoke, it is not in them; Nature has no &s;uch
thwart Lines drawn over their Con&s;titution;
they are united in Good, and can never be
united in Evil too; the&s;e Contraries would not
illu&s;trate, but de&s;troy one another; in a word,
they are all Love, and becau&s;e they are all
Love, therefore their Behaviour is all Peace;
the Calm is in the Soul, and when it is &s;o, there
can never be a Storm in the Mind; Love is
not in them a Pa&s;&s;ion but a Quality; 'tis footed
and riveted in their very Beings, they have a
Di&s;po&s;ition to it in their very Nature.</P>
<P>THIS being a &s;ettled Principle in them, both
natural and habitual, it comes of cour&s;e to
exert it &s;elf in the Article of Matrimony. I
They re&s;olve not to marry but where they are
&s;ure and fully &s;atisfy'd they can Love, that is
to &s;ay, that as they re&s;olve it to be a Duty, &s;o
they re&s;olve to practice it. 2. In order to this,
<PB N="116" REF="132">
Prudence directs them to reject every Offer where
Love does not concur with the other Circum|&s;tances,
and make the Per&s;on perfectly not a|greeable
only, but the Object of their &s;incere
and compleat Affection, and that upon good
Foundations too.</P>
<P>WHEN the&s;e Things happen, then they mar|ry
; if the Per&s;on thus marry'd meets with a
Di&s;appointment, as how often is the &s;incere&s;t
Affection abu&s;ed, be it that the Lady marries a
bad Husband, is mi&s;taken in the Object, fixes
her Mind upon an unworthy Fellow that feign|ed
Love, and Honour, and Vertue, in his Ad|dre&s;&s;es,
and proves a Hypocrite in them all;
what is the Con&s;equence? She is made mi&s;era|ble
indeed, and wretchedly &s;o; But we do not
&s;ee the Hou&s;e made a <HI>Bedlam;</HI> it is not Fire on
one Side and Tinder on the other; it is not
Sulphur and Nitre, which meeting makes
Thunder; the Brute behaves as Brutes will;
but the poor Lady mourns, &s;ees her &s;elf made
mi&s;erable by the Man &s;he loves; bears it as
Chri&s;tians bear remedile&s;s Sorrows, perhaps
pines under it and dies, as is the fate of many
a faithful, tender, affectionate Wife: And 'tis
the &s;ame thing in the Man, he takes a Lady,
in appearance good; &s;he is to him the Wife of
his Youth, of his Affection, of his fir&s;t and pu|re&s;t
Love, whom he made his Choice before
Marriage, and places his Delight in afterward:
But as none can &s;ee the In&s;ide and Soul of the
Object, &s;he proves a Piece of Froth and Va|nity;
is idle, luxurious, expenfive, thoughtle&s;s
in her Affairs, cold and indifferent in her Affe|ction,
and, at la&s;t, loo&s;e and light; and, in a
word, any thing, or every thing, that is fooli&s;h
and wicked.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="133">
IT is not ea&s;y to de&s;cribe the angui&s;h of his
Soul at the di&s;appointment: He had fixed his
Love with a firm and riveted Force as a wi&s;e
Man would and ought, long before he married
her, nay, perhaps before he courted her; he had
cho&s;en her from the beautiful, the wealthy,
the virtuous, and the good-humoured, among
whom his Circum&s;tances being good, he had
room to choo&s;e.</P>
<P>AS he loved before Marriage, he re&s;olved to
love her afterwards, becau&s;e he was &s;ure he
&s;hould; and thus he re&s;olved to make her hap|py,
and make him&s;elf happy, in having her.
But how is he di&s;appointed when he finds a
Traitor in his Bo&s;om, a Fury in his Bed, a
Serpent in his Arms, that neither loves, values
or regards him? That, after a few Years, or per|haps
Days, forgets all her Matrimonial Vows,
the ftronge&s;t Ties of the &s;olemne&s;t Oath; thinks
of nothing but Plea&s;ure and Folly, de&s;pi&s;es the
Entreaties of her Husband, and at la&s;t him&s;elf,
as a Husband; and, it may be, clo&s;es all with
running away from him, or with ruining him,
breaking both his Heart and his Fortunes to|gether.</P>
<P>THESE are &s;ome of the Di&s;a&s;ters where the
Love is on one Side without the other. What
mu&s;t then be the Con&s;equences where it is of
neither Side? How mi&s;erable, how di&s;tracted a
Family does it make! And in what wretched
Doings does it frequently End? To marry with|out
Affection! It &s;eems to be like two Bulls
chained together, that being tied &s;o clo&s;e as
that they cannot gore and kill one another, yet
are always &s;triving to do it, wi&s;hing to do it;
and, if they break the Bonds, never fail to
bring it to pa&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="134">
I cannot think, and have &s;o many Rea&s;ons
for my Opinion, I believe I &s;hall never alter
it; I &s;ay, I cannot think the Marriage can be
lawful where there was not a re&s;olved &s;ettled
Affection, &s;incerely embraced before the Matri|mony
was contracted. I will not follow Mr.
<HI>Milton,</HI> and carry it up to this, that it may be
di&s;&s;olved again upon that &s;ingle Account: No,
no, I &s;hall open no Doors to the vitiated Wi&s;hes
of the Times; where Men would have Mar|riage
be a &s;tated Contract; where as the Parties
agreement made the Bargain, &s;o the &s;ame mu|tual
Agreement might di&s;&s;olve it; where as in|&s;incere
Love joined them, a &s;incere and perfect
Hatred &s;hould part them again. This would
&s;ill the World with Confu&s;ion, would pollute
the Ordinance of Matrimony in&s;tead of keep|ing
it &s;acred as GOD's holy Ordinance; 'twould
make Marriage a Stale, a Convenience, to
gratify the &s;en&s;ual Part, and to be made u&s;e
of as a thing not to be named; and when that
wor&s;t Part of the Affections was &s;atiated, the
Parties be left to plea&s;e and grati&s;y their wick|ed
Appetite with Variety.</P>
<P>THIS is not talking like Chri&s;tians, or like
Men of Virtue, no, not like Men guided by
human Prudence, or by civil Polity, much le&s;s
Rea&s;on; for this would corrupt the Blood of
Families, level Mankind with one another,
confound Order, and, in a word, would fill the
World with Whoredom.</P>
<P>NO, no; if you will ru&s;h like the Hor&s;e in|to
the Battle; if you will be mad, and follow
ra&s;hly, and without Con&s;ideration, the raging
heat of corrupt Inclination only, and go hood|winked
and blinded, you mu&s;t take the Con&s;e|quences
to your &s;elves; if you will wed with|out
<PB N="119" REF="135">
Affection, you mu&s;t be content to live
without Affection; if you come madly together,
you mu&s;t expect to live madly together; as King
<HI>Charles</HI> &s;aid to his Brother, the Duke of <HI>York,</HI>
when he had married the Lord Chancellor's
Daughter in private, and would have di&s;owned
her in publick, you mu&s;t <HI>Drink as you Brew;</HI>
in &s;hort, the Bond is too &s;acred to be broken at
plea&s;ure; the Chain too ftrong for the two
Bulls to break; as you are once bound you
mu&s;t remain in Bonds; once in <HI>Algier,</HI> and
ever a Slave; nothing relea&s;es you but a Re|demption
by Death, on one Side or other.</P>
<P>HOW fooli&s;h then, as well as wicked and un|lawful,
is it to marry before you love? To
ru&s;h into a &s;tate of irrecoverable Life without
the only Article that can make it tolerable?
They that marry without Affection go to Sea
without a Rudder; launch into the mo&s;t dange|rous
Ocean without a Pilot, and without a
Compa&s;s: Love is the only Pilot of a married
State; without it there is nothing but Danger
in the Attempt, nothing but Ruin in the Con&s;e|quence.</P>
<P>THE dirty Part of it I have mentioned; and
I &s;till in&s;i&s;t upon it, that it is not a Matrimony
of a right kind; to me it is no Matrimony at
all, but a corrupt, ra&s;h, hot-headed (and worfe)
Bargain, made to gratify the wor&s;t Part of the
Man or Woman, to plea&s;e the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Part of
his Con&s;titution, and for nothing el&s;e. Let a

<P>SHE cannot &s;ay, &s;he marries for Mainte|nance,
for &s;he is rich, and has a plentiful
E&s;tate.</P>
<P>SHE cannot &s;ay, &s;he marries for Affection,
for &s;he declares &s;he don't love him.</P>
<P>SHE cannot &s;ay, 'tis to have Children, for
&s;he &s;ays &s;omething el&s;e to that, of which our
next Chapter &s;hall &s;peak more fully.</P>
<P>PRAY then, what do you marry this Man
for? Her An&s;wer, if &s;he will &s;peak Truth,
mu&s;t be this: Truly, becau&s;e I want to lie with
a Man. Horrid Plea! Is this a ju&s;t Rea&s;on for
Matrimony! And can it be hone&s;tly called Ma|trimony
; whatever it may be called in the
Sen&s;e of legal Forms, can it be called &s;o in the
Sen&s;e of Con&s;cience and of Honour? Is it not
much more proper to &s;ay, 'tis a Matrimonial
Whoredom?</P>
<P>I &s;ee but one An&s;wer that can be given to
this Argument, or be made a Plea for this kind
of Matrimony, and this is a coar&s;e one for
either Party, I confe&s;s; but much more &s;o for
the Ladies, <HI>viz.</HI> That Marriage is &s;aid to be
appointed to prevent Fornication; and that 'tis
a Scripture direction to marry, rather than to
burn. Let them that marry upon this Founda|tion
acknowledge it then, and tell one another
&s;o before-hand, and &s;ee how the Tale will &s;it
upon the Tongue of a young Gentleman, when
he courts a Lady, and begins to addre&s;s her
thus:</P>
<P>MADAM, I have a great de&s;ire to marry
you.</P>
<P>PRAY Sir, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> what do you de&s;ire me
for? You don't love me, I hear.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="137">
WHY, no truly, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I can't &s;ay I have
much love for you, or for any Body el&s;e.</P>
<P>WHY then do you marry, pray? <HI>&s;ays &s;he.</HI></P>
<P>WHY, Madam, to tell you the truth, <HI>&s;ays
he,</HI> I want a Woman, and I am loth to go to a
Whore; &s;o I will &s;upply my &s;elf in a lawful
way.</P>
<P>THIS would be very Impudent, you'll &s;ay,
it may be; but I mu&s;t add, 'tis hone&s;t, and
much hone&s;ter, than to &s;wear he loves her above
all the World, damns him&s;elf over and over if
he don't; tells her a thou&s;and Lies to draw her
in, and when he is married, tells her the Truth
in a Bruti&s;h and in&s;olent manner, that he never
cared one Farthing for her; that he wanted a
Woman, and took her for his Convenience; and
that now he has had his fill of her, &s;he would
greatly oblige him if &s;he would di&s;po&s;e of her
&s;elf out of his way, offering her one of his
Garters for the Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>IT would lead me into the grand Error of
Language, which I have profe&s;s'd to avoid, if I
&s;hould pretend to give this wicked, vile Part,
a full Delineation; 'tis difficult to expre&s;s &s;uch
a dirty Subject in clean Words; and therefore I
avoid giving the Ladies the Anatomy of a Cou|ple
come together without a previous Affection;
or the Di&s;cour&s;es that pa&s;s between them when
perhaps, one Side or other are di&s;appointed in
the grand Expectation. It would &s;urfeit the
Reader to hear a certain Trade&s;man's Lady call
her Husband&mdash;Dog, and ask him what he
thinks &s;he married him for? Nor &s;hould I men|tion
&s;o foul a Story, did not Mrs.&mdash;give
all her Neighbours leave to hear her &s;ay a thou|&s;and
Things, in plainer <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> to him every
Day, of a gro&s;&s;er kind.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="138">
IF the Ladies will &s;peak, the Boys and Girls
in the Street will never hold their Tongues.
When the Secrets of the Bed-Chamber become
no longer Secrets, and the Wife &s;hall publi&s;h her
own Shame, who can &s;he think will conceal it?
When &s;he cea&s;es to Blu&s;h, who will Blu&s;h for
her?</P>
<P>BUT 'tis enough; let us touch this vile Part
with as light a Stroke as po&s;&s;ible, and you mu&s;t

<P>THIS is the Effect of marrying without Af|fection,
without a &s;erious, preingaged Soul,
without mutual and unfeigned Complai&s;ance
and Delight one in another; in a word, this is
what I call <HI>Matrimonial Whoredom;</HI> if I mi&s;cal
it, let me be convinced by the better Behaviour

and of u&s;ing Means phy&s;ical
or diabolical, to prevent Conception.</HEAD>
<P>_THAT Matrimony was in&s;tituted
for the regular Propagation of
Kind, I have noted already, and
need repeat no Part of it; I only
add, that the pre&s;ent vitiated
Humour of the Times has brought
up our modern Wits to cavil at the Words <HI>regular
Propagation.</HI> They will allow it to be proper for
the Regularity; but not e&s;&s;ential to the Propa|gation,
and &s;o they would have Matrimony be
only taken for civil Regulation of Govern|ment,
appointed meerly by humane Polity, and
the Contrivance of State&s;men, to keep the
People in a kind of formal Subjection to
Con&s;titutions and Government, and to make the
Lawyers Work, to order Inheritances and Suc|ce&s;&s;ions,
as they think fit.</P>
<P>FOR, &s;ay they, in the Beginning it was not
&s;o; and then they bring us the Story of <HI>Abra|ham</HI>

Si&s;ters, and then lying with both their Maids, and
the like. The&s;e Examples, they &s;ay, prove that
<PB N="124" REF="140">
Propagation, being a general Work, ought not
to be brought into Bondage, and under the Sub|jection
of the&s;e Con&s;titution-Regularities, but
that Succe&s;&s;ions and Inheritances &s;hould be
wholly Patriarchal, the Father dividing his
Sub&s;tance among his Children, as he thinks fit;
and then they add Mr. <HI>Dryden,</HI> a leud Poet, up|on
that Subject:
<Q><L>&startq;When Man on many multiply'd his kind,</L>

<P>IF I was upon the Subject of <HI>Poligamy</HI> in this
Chapter, I &s;hould perhaps &s;ea&s;onably too, an|&s;wer
this corrupt Way of Rea&s;oning here; but
it may come in its Place; at pre&s;ent my
Thoughts and Applications are another
Way.</P>
<P>THE Laws of our Country, and the acknow|ledged
Principles of the Chri&s;tian Religion
which we profe&s;s, have united their Force to
lay us under Subjection to this Part of Con&s;ti|tution-Government,
<HI>as tho&s;e Men call it;</HI> and
be it right or wrong in its won Nature, be it
better or wor&s;e in it &s;elf, and in its Circum|&s;tances,
we are under this Regulation, born in
the reach of it, the Laws of GOD and of our
Country bind us to it, and there is no room to
make that a Pretence; the Cavil can have no
force among us in this Nation.</P>
<P>LET me explain a little upon this Subject, and
if it be too grave, I &s;hall be the &s;horter, but it is
ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to be under&s;tood: It is plain,
whatever Silence we may pretend the Scripture
has &s;hewn, our Laws have determined it to be
fixed fa&s;t upon us; no Man may have two
Wives at a time here.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="141">
1. BECAUSE the Laws of the Land forbid it,
and make it criminal.</P>
<P>2. BECAUSE both the Man and the Woman
bind them&s;elves again&s;t it by mutual Agree|ment,
and marry po&s;itively upon that Con|dition.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> THE Laws of the Land. Every Law is,
as I may &s;ay, of our own making: Every Man
is bound by the Laws of his Country, he is
bound to the Obligation, that is, to obey and
&s;ubject him&s;elf to them; and he con&s;ents in
the making to &s;ubmit to the Puni&s;hment in
Ca&s;e of a Breach of the&s;e Laws: The Parlia|ment
is a true Repre&s;entative of the whole
Country; every Subject is pre&s;ent at the mak|ing
every Law that pa&s;&s;es, though not per&s;o|nally,
yet he is pre&s;ent repre&s;entatively in his
Repre&s;entative, and actually makes every Law
that pa&s;&s;ies; he con&s;ents to it, and &s;ubmit, or
promi&s;es to &s;ubmit to it; and this makes his
Puni&s;hment ju&s;t and rational too, if he breaks
the Law, becau&s;e he fir&s;t yielded to be go|verned
by it.</P>
<P>NOW the Laws of our Country are of two
Kinds in this Ca&s;e; the Common or Statute
Law, and the Divine Law, which we call Con|&s;cience;
the fir&s;t makes what we call Con&s;ti|tution,
and is founded upon what our Le|gi&s;lature
&s;uppo&s;ed to be the meaning and de|&s;ign
of the Laws of GOD; for the legi&s;lative
Authority of our Country never are intended
to contradict either the Law of Nature or the
Divine Law.</P>
<P>AS then the Laws of our Country enjoin
it.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="142">
AS the&s;e Laws of our Country are con&s;o|nant
to, or at lea&s;t are &s;uppo&s;ed to be found|ed
upon the Laws of GOD, and the Laws of
Nature.</P>
<P>AND as we are all bound, as Members of the
Con&s;titution, to &s;ubmit to, and be governed by
the Laws of our Country.</P>
<P>AND, la&s;tly, we are bound by the Laws of
GOD, to obey the lawful Authority of that Go|vernment
and Country we live under.</P>
<P>SO by all the&s;e Obligations we are obliged
again&s;t Poligamy, and it would be a &s;inful Ex|cur&s;ion
for us to come into it.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Becau&s;e both the Man and the Wo|man
bind them&s;elves again&s;t it by mutual A|greement,
and marry po&s;itively upon that Con|dition.</P>
<P>WHAT we are mutually engaged by Contract
to perform, and which it is lawful to perform,
it is unlawful for us not to perform. It is a
Vulgar, but well-founded Proverb or proverbial
Saying, Every hone&s;t Man is as good as his
Word. Certainly a mutual Compact is mutu|ally
obliging; nor can it be pretended, that
there is any Force in it, for the Man knows he
marries upon that Condition; if not, let him
but tell his Wife he will, notwith&s;tanding his
Agreement, marry another while &s;he is living;
and let him &s;ee who will take him upon tho&s;e
Terms; if the Lady con&s;ents to it, that's ano|ther
Ca&s;e. I &s;hall then &s;ay this only,(<HI>viz.</HI>)
that he does not offend her; he commits no
Breach, no Tre&s;pa&s;s upon her; as to his di&s;|obeying
and breaking the Laws of GOD and of
his Country; let him an&s;wer for that where
tho&s;e Things are to be an&s;wered for: But as to
<PB N="127" REF="143">
his Wife, he does her no Wrong, if he takes ten
Wives together, becau&s;e &s;he con&s;ented to it,
and took him under the expre&s;s Condition.</P>
<P>THIS, I think, is a true &s;tate of the Ca&s;e,
and confirms this Point; that let us pretend to
what Excu&s;e we will for Poligamy, from the
pretended Silence of the Scripture, yet we are
effectually prohibited and fore-clo&s;ed by the
Laws of the Land, and, by our voluntary Con|&s;ent,
expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;olemne&s;t of all Oath, the
Marriage Contract.</P>
<P>BEING then under the Obligation of &s;ingle|handed
Matrimony, let us talk of it as it lies,
and go back to where we left off: This Matri|mony
is at lea&s;t the only, lawful, e&s;tabli&s;hed
and regular Means of Propagation of the Spe|cies.
All Births out of this Circle are, as it
was in the old <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution, out of GOD's
Congregation, for a Ba&s;tard was excluded to the
fourth Generation; and all our Births <HI>extra</HI> Ma|trimonial,
or, as the <HI>Scots</HI> call it, on <HI>the wrong
Side of the Blankets,</HI> are &s;purious, illegitimate,
and given up to the Reproach of Ba&s;tardy,
e&s;teemed Corrupt in Blood, and carry the Blot
or Blend in the E&s;cutcheon to the End of Time,
&s;o that the Brand is indelible; no Time, no
Merit of Per&s;ons, no Purcha&s;e of Honours or
Titles, can wipe out the remembrance of it.</P>
<P>THIS then being the Ca&s;e, I need not tell
the Ladies that this is the only Way by which
they are allowed, with Honour and Reputation,
to bring forth Children; 'tis the only Protection
to their Characters when they are with Child,
<HI>viz.</HI> That they have a Father for it; that it was
born in Wedlock; &s;uch a young Lady is big
with Child, there Scandal begins to open its
Mouth: Well, what then, &s;he is married!
<PB N="128" REF="144">
There's an immediate An&s;wer that &s;tops every
body's Mouth; and the Virtue of the Lady is no
more &s;truck at, nor can be; for 'tis the Road of
Nature, joined with the direction and limitation
of the Law, and that as well the Laws of GOD
and Man; of which at large in its Place.</P>
<P>BUT how then comes it to pa&s;s that People
marry that would have no Offspring? And
from what Principles do the&s;e People act who
marry, and tell us, they hope they &s;hall have
no Children? This is to me one of the mo&s;t
unwarrantable and prepo&s;terous Things that I
can think of in all the Articles of Matrimony;
nor can I make out; if I were to &s;et up to de|&s;end
it, I &s;ay, I could not for my Life make
it out, that there is the lea&s;t pretence in it to
Hone&s;ty, or to Mode&s;ty, nay, I would not un|dertake
to ju&s;tify the Morality of it.</P>
<P>BUT let us fir&s;t &s;ee if it can be reconciled to
<HI>Mode&s;ly;</HI> for that is the particular Point I am
upon, and whether it does not come ju&s;tly under
the Reproach of the Matrimonial Whoredom
that I am &s;peaking of.</P>
<P>IF you &s;hould come to a Lady of the great|e&s;t
Mode&s;ty and Virtue in the World, and put
it clo&s;e to her upon any weighty Part of the
Subject, as about Settlements, inheriting E|&s;tates,
and the like, &s;he would not &s;cruple, tho'
perhaps with &s;ome little Reluctance, at that
Kind of the Que&s;tion, that &s;he expects to have
Children when the Gentlemen and &s;he comes
together: Mode&s;ty obliges the Lady to &s;hun
and avoid the Di&s;cour&s;e as much as &s;he can;
but &s;he tacitly owns &s;he is to be under&s;tood &s;o
in the very Nature of the Thing; and if &s;he is
talked to among her own Sex, where &s;he could be
free, and they were &s;o weak as to ask her &s;uch a
<PB N="129" REF="145">
Que&s;tion, which I think few Women would
do, as, whether &s;he expected to have any Chil|dren?
She would &s;ay, Yes, to be &s;ure; what do
you think I marry for el&s;e?</P>
<P>NOW take a married Life, with all its <HI>Ad|denda</HI>
of Family Cares, the trouble of looking
after a Hou&s;hold, the hazard of being &s;ubject
to the Humours and Pa&s;&s;ions of a churli&s;h Man,
and particularly of being di&s;appointed, and
matching with a Tyrant, and a Family-Brute;
with &s;till the more apparent hazard of being
ruined in Fortune by his Di&s;a&s;ters if a Trade&s;|man,
by his Immoralities if a Gentleman, and
by his Vices if a Rake: I &s;ay, what Woman in
her Sen&s;es would tie her &s;elf up in the Fetters of
Matrimony, if it were not that &s;he de&s;ires to be a
Mother of Children, to multiply her Kind, and,
in &s;hort, have a Family?</P>
<P>IF &s;he did not, &s;he would be next to Lunatick
to marry, to give up her Liberty, take a Man
to call Ma&s;ter, and promi&s;e when &s;he takes
him to <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Obey</HI> him. What! give her
&s;elf away for nothing! Mortgage the Mirth, the
Freedom, the Liberty, and all the Plea&s;ures of
her Virgin-&s;tate, the Honour and Authority of
being her own, and at her own di&s;po&s;e, and all
this to be a <HI>Barren Doe,</HI> a Wife without Chil|dren;
a Di&s;honour to her Husband, and a Re|proach
to her &s;elf! Can any Woman in her
Wits do thus? It is not indeed con&s;i&s;tent with
common Sen&s;e.</P>
<P>TAKE it then on the Man's Side, 'tis the
&s;ame Thing. I have known indeed a Man pre|tend
to profe&s;s &s;uch an Aver&s;ion to Children
in the Hou&s;e, and to the Noi&s;e and Imperti|nences
of them, as he called it, that he could
not bear the Thoughts of them. But then this
<PB N="130" REF="146">
Man did not pretend to marry; and &s;o far he
was in the right; his Conduct was con|gruous,
and con&s;i&s;tent with it &s;elf, and he was
all of a Piece.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> BUT then pray note, <HI>by the way,</HI> this
Man married afterwards, and then he was ready
to hang him&s;elf that he had no Children; that
he was not like other Families; that he look'd
like a Hou&s;e that Heaven had bla&s;ted; that
others had Children enough, and &s;ome more
than they could keep, but he that had a plen|tiful
Fortune, a beautiful Woman to his Wife,
and both of them in Health, and Years &s;uitable,
&s;hould be barren.</P>
<P>AFTER &s;ome time, that, as if to puni&s;h his
unju&s;t Aver&s;ions, his Wife was with-held Chil|bearing,
&s;he brought him two Sons at a Birth;
the Man was over-joyed and thankful for
them, and the fonde&s;t Father in the World:
Thus he &s;tood reproved for his former Error,
and was a living Witne&s;s again&s;t him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Part of his Conduct was &s;candalou&s;ly
wrong, as I have &s;aid; the aver&s;ion to Chil|dren
was unnatural; but then he acted the ra|tional
Part &s;o far, that he did not marry. But
for a Man or Woman to marry, and then &s;ay,
they de&s;ire to have no Children, that is a
Piece of prepo&s;terous Non&s;ence, next to Lunacy.</P>
<P>IF <HI>A. G.</HI> a grave Je&s;ter at Matrimony, who
tells us, 'tis the only Rea&s;on he does not mar|ry,
that boa&s;ts the Ladies are every Day dying
for him, and that he would marry but that he
hates Children; I &s;ay, if he will plea&s;e to have
one of tho&s;e modern witted Ladies that de&s;ires
to marry, but would have no Children, they
may certainly marry, and yet re&s;olve upon the
whole&s;ome Negative between them for a cer|tain
<PB N="131" REF="147">
Space of Time, <HI>viz.</HI> to Number fifty, or
thereabouts; and 'tis great odds but they may
obtain the &s;eeming An&s;wer to their Reque&s;t,
and go barren to the Grave.</P>
<P>BUT if any doubt the Sincerity of the La|dies
who make tho&s;e Pretences, let the Gentle|men
who has a mind to try them effectually,
and who profe&s;&s;es to love a pretty Lady's Con|ver&s;ation,
but hates this fooli&s;h thing called
Coition, as <HI>Religio Medici</HI> calls it; I &s;ay, let
him put (<HI>Origin</HI>) upon him&s;elf, and then
Court one of tho&s;e cha&s;t Wou'd-be-barren La|dies,

My Word for them, and no venture neither,
not one of them would care to be &s;een in his

Every Body cheats me, no Body will
pay me; Mr.&mdash;has left me in good
Circum&s;tances, but 'tis all abroad in Debts

every Body impo&s;es upon me; What &s;hall I
do? I think verily, if I could but find &s;uch a

nau&s;eous Bu&s;ine&s;s of a Husband and a Bed|fellow,
and the re&s;t of it. I profe&s;s my Sto|mach
turns at the Thoughts of it; the very

quite off all my Thoughts again, &s;o that, in

<P>&startq;Oh Child, &s;ays &s;he, I have thought of

&s;ee them marry an <HI>Origin,</HI> or &s;uch a Man as
this Lady recommended to her Friend, and,
<HI>knowing him to be &s;uch,</HI> then I &s;hall no longer
doubt their Sincerity.</P>
<P>OR when one of tho&s;e Ladies, profe&s;&s;ing an
Aver&s;ion to Children, &s;hall al&s;o maintain an
<PB N="133" REF="149">
Aver&s;ion to Matrimony becau&s;e of it, and &s;hall
reject all the be&s;t Offers, the hand&s;ome&s;t Gen|tlemen,
&s;uitable Settlements, agreeable Fi|gures,
and the like, and re&s;olve the Celibacy of
her Life, purely becau&s;e &s;he would have no
Children; this indeed, however it may reflect
upon her Sen&s;e, and her Wi&s;dom, will yet re|flect
nothing upon her Virtue, or upon her Sin|cerity,
becau&s;e &s;he acts according to her profe&s;s'd
Sentiments; and all her Conduct is of a Piece.</P>
<P>BUT to pretend to all this Aver&s;ion for
Children, to nau&s;eate the Nur&s;ing, the Watch|ing,
the Squaling, the fatigue of bringing up
Children, which, as they call it, makes a Wc|man
a Slave and a Drudge all her Days; to be
perpetually exclaiming again&s;t this, and then
MARRY, what mu&s;t we call this?</P>
<P>FOR a young, hand&s;ome and agreeable Lady,
with all the Blu&s;hes and Mode&s;ty of her Vir|gin
Years about her, and under the be&s;t of E|ducation,
to marry, go naked to Bed, and re|ceive
the Man, as it were, in her Arms, and
then &s;ay, &s;he hopes &s;he &s;hall have no Children,
and &s;he de&s;ires to have no Children, this is a
language I cannot under&s;tand; it will bear no
mode&s;t Con&s;truction in my Thoughts, and, in
a word, is neither more or le&s;s than acknow|ledging
that &s;he would have the Plea&s;ure of
lying with a Man, but would not have the
lea&s;t Interruption from her u&s;ual Company
keeping; the Jollitry and Mirth of her younger
Years; that &s;he would not abate her Plea&s;ures,
&s;he would not be confined at home, or loaded
with the Cares of being a Mother.</P>
<P>IN a word, &s;he would have the U&s;e of the
Man, but &s;he would not act the Part of the
Woman; &s;he would have him be the Hu&s;|band,
<PB N="134" REF="150">
but &s;he would not be a Wife, and, if
you bear the blunt Stile that &s;ome People put
it into, &s;he would only keep a St&mdash;n.</P>
<P>THERE is indeed no di&s;&s;embling the Matter,
'tis neither better or wor&s;e; &s;he would plea&s;e
her Appetite with the bare brutal Part, but
would be freed from that which &s;he calls the
trouble of Matrimony <HI>Child-bearing;</HI> which,
by the way, the mo&s;t virtuous, mode&s;t, cha&s;t
and valuable Ladies in the World, have, in all
Ages, e&s;teemed to be the Ble&s;&s;ing of a mar|ried
Life.</P>
<P>I remember there was an Example of a Lady
in a certain neighbouring Country, who mar|ried
a Per&s;on of Quality, but conditioned with
him not to cohabit for a certain Time, I think
it was for a Year or two; and the Rea&s;on &s;he
gave for it was, that &s;he would not &s;poil her
Shape; but then, as above, &s;he conditioned not
to cohabit, and yet when &s;he did cohabit, her
Lord did not find her &s;o cha&s;t, or that her Vir|tue
was of &s;o much value to her as her Beauty;
and &s;he ventured, if Fame lies not, the &s;poil|ing
her Shapes, in an extraordinary manner,
when &s;he declined the Enjoyment of her own
Husband, and ran the ri&s;que of her &s;mall Wa&s;te
in the ordinary way. But that Part is not to
the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>IN all the Examples I have met with, where
the Conduct of the Per&s;on has been ju&s;tifiable,
they have joined to their Aver&s;ions for Child|bearing
the proper Remedies, namely, ab&s;ti|nence
from the Men; if the Lady that de&s;ires
to be no Breeder, keeps her &s;elf &s;ingle and
cha&s;t; if &s;he pre&s;erves her Virtue, and remains
unmarried, I have no more to &s;ay, let it be to
her as &s;he de&s;ires; no doubt &s;he will not be
<PB N="135" REF="151">
troubled with Children if &s;he <HI>knows not a Man;</HI>
if &s;he with-holds the Means, Nature will cer|tainly
with-hold the End, and if &s;he dies Vir|tuous,
I warrant her &s;he dies Barren.</P>
<P>BUT here is a farther, and yet more fatal
Mi&s;chief attending, and which, if the Wi&s;h is
real, as I am to &s;uppo&s;e it is, I &s;ee no room to
forbear &s;ugge&s;ting, that &s;he will certainly u&s;e
&s;ome Means to prevent it. The Truth is, there
is not much Sen&s;e in the Di&s;cour&s;e without it,
as there is no Hone&s;ty with it: For what can a
Woman &s;ay to her &s;elf that lies with a Man
every Night, and yet really wi&s;hes and de&s;ires
to have no Children? 'Tis mo&s;t natural to &s;ay,
why I mu&s;t either take &s;ome Method or other
with my &s;elf, or I &s;hall certainly be with
Child.</P>
<P>A certain Lady, not a hundred Miles from
St.<HI>Ann</HI>'s&mdash;, and who was one of the merry
Club, called, <HI>The A&s;&s;embly of Barren Does,</HI> had
an unplea&s;ant Dialogue with a Friend of hers,
who &s;he thought to be a Privy-Councellor of
Hell, but proved not quite wicked enough for
her, upon this very Subject; another Lady be|ing
pre&s;ent, who prote&s;ted again&s;t the Propo|&s;als,
though &s;he was not aver&s;e to the Thing,
for which they were propo&s;ed.</P>

your having any Children, though you
married according to GOD's holy Ordinance;
which Ordinance, as the Office of Matrimony
tells you, was appointed for that very End;
to take Medicines therefore to prevent, or to
de&s;troy that Conception, are equally wicked
in their Intention, and it is the End of every

only in the degree.</P>

<P>He would be very angry, I believe in|deed,
very angry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Well, Cou&s;in, and &s;o I will, but that
is not the Ca&s;e, I don't fear his knowing it; but
as to what you were &s;aying before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, as I &s;aid before, I &s;ay again, your
taking Phy&s;ick before-hand to prevent your be|ing

after it was formed in your Womb.</P>

<P>I can't help that, I had rather fright you

that by this Medicine you de&s;troy a younger

Why may I not take &s;omething to pre|vent
my being with Child now, when, as I tell
you, I am &s;ure I am not with Child, except for
a Night only? And why &s;hould I be with
Child ju&s;t now more than all this while?</P>
<P>HERE the Di&s;cour&s;e &s;topt a-while; and the
Cou&s;in, though &s;he had &s;aid it was again&s;t her
Con&s;cience and Judgment, was prevailed with
to tell her of a Medicine, and a devili&s;h one it
was, if &s;he had &s;et down all the Particulars.
<HI>N. B.</HI> You are to note, that it was a Medicine
indeed for the wicked Purpo&s;e; but the other
Lady that gave it her kept out the main and
mo&s;t dangerous Ingredients, and gave her, as
appeared afterwards, nothing but what, if &s;he
had been with Child, &s;he might have taken
with the greate&s;t Safety in the World. How|ever,
the other having believed &s;he had taken
<PB N="143" REF="159">
other Things, her Imagination made it work
other Effects than it would have done.</P>
<P>WHEN &s;he had taken the Medicine it made
her very &s;ick, and, in a word, &s;et her a Vomit|ing
and Purging mo&s;t violently, and that threw
her into a high Fever.</P>
<P>IN her Fever &s;he was exceedingly &s;truck in
her Con&s;cience with the Fact; and I could give
a very plea&s;ing Account from her own Mouth,
of her after Reflections upon the criminal Part,
which &s;he was then convinced of, and began
to be penitent for. But that Part is too &s;erious
for this Time of Day, and few of the Readers
of our Times may be grave enough to reli&s;h
it.</P>
<P>BUT the Story turns upon another Part, be|ing
extremely afflicted at what &s;he had done,
and having no Body to give vent to her Mind
about it, her Cou&s;in, who had unhappily given
her the Direction, being gone into the Coun|try;
I &s;ay, the want of her to vent her
Thoughts, and ea&s;e her Mind to, joined to the
Fever, made her delirious or light-headed; and
in one of her Fits of Talking &s;he knew not
what, &s;he unhappily betrayed the Secret, told
what &s;he had done to the Nur&s;e that tended
her, and &s;he had Di&s;cretion little enough to
tell it to her Husband's Mother, and &s;he to her
Son, the Lady's Husband.</P>
<P>IT moved him with a variety of Pa&s;&s;ions, as,
in particular, an Indignation at the horrid
Fact, Anger at his Wife, who, thought he loved
to an Extreme, and had never &s;hewn the lea&s;t
Unkindne&s;s to her before, yet he could not re|frain,
<HI>&s;ick as &s;he was,</HI> and even at Death's Door,
to reproach her with it, and that in the bittere&s;t
Terms, which put her into a violent Agony,
<PB N="144" REF="160">
&s;o that every one about her thought he had
killed her; and then he was as Angry with
him&s;elf at the impatience of his Temper.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, to make out the &s;hort Hi&s;tory
in a few Words, the Lady recovered, the Fever
went off, and &s;he was re&s;tored to health, but
that was not all, &s;he was re&s;tored to her Sen&s;es
in the Point in which &s;he had tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed, as I
&s;aid, upon her Mode&s;ty. But &s;he &s;uffered &s;ome
Affliction in that very Article, that &s;he had
been blamed for; &s;he lived near two Years
more with her Husband, and never was with
Child; and all the while &s;he was under the
greate&s;t Affliction for not being with Child,
much more than &s;he was before for fear of it,
and indeed with much more Foundation.</P>
<P>HER Apprehen&s;ions now were, that her Hu&s;|band
&s;hould &s;uppo&s;e either that &s;he &s;till u&s;ed
Art with her &s;elf to prevent her being with
Child, or to de&s;troy a Conception after it had
taken place, or that &s;he had injured her &s;elf
&s;ome Way or other, by what &s;he had formerly
done in &s;uch a manner, that now it was pro|bable
&s;he might never be with Child at all;
and the&s;e Thoughts, e&s;pecially the la&s;t, did
really make &s;uch an Impre&s;&s;ion upon her Hu&s;|band,
before &s;he could ea&s;ily perceive a great
alteration in his Conduct and Carriage to her,
that he was colder, and, as &s;he thought, very
much changed in his Affection to her, carried it
with indifference and flight, looked upon him|&s;elf
as greatly injured and abu&s;ed by her; fre|quently
talked as if he thought the Ends of
Matrimony being really unju&s;tly de&s;troyed by
her with de&s;ign, and wilfully, their Marriage
was void in Law, and ought to be di&s;&s;olved in
form; and once or twice, if not oftner, intimated
<PB N="145" REF="161">
TO her, that he thought of bringing it
into Parliament, in order to obtain a di&s;&s;olu|tion
of their Marriage.</P>
<P>THIS terrified her to the la&s;t Degree; &s;he
behaved her &s;elf to him with great &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion,
and indeed, more than he de&s;ired; frequently,
and on all Occa&s;ions, prote&s;ted to him with all
po&s;&s;ible &s;olemnity, that &s;he had not taken the
lea&s;t Step, or entertained a Thought of doing
&s;o, towards any thing of that kind, &s;ince her
late Fever; a&s;&s;ured him of her being fully &s;a|tisfied
that it was unlawful, and that &s;he had
committed a great Crime in what &s;he had done
before; that it was a Sin again&s;t her Hu&s;|band;
that &s;he had injured him in it, di&s;ho|noured
her &s;elf, and offended again&s;t the Laws
both of GOD and Man. He could not &s;ay
more to her than &s;he did to load her &s;elf, and
managed &s;o well, &s;o humble, upon the main
Subject, and &s;o obliging to him, that &s;he con|vinced
him of her Sincerity, and he became
fully &s;atisfied of that Part, as indeed he had
great Rea&s;on to be upon many Accounts.</P>
<P>BUT for what was pa&s;s'd, there was no An|&s;wer
to be given to it; &s;he hardly knew what
&s;he had done, and what &s;he had not done; &s;he
did not know what &s;he had taken, except the
Names of &s;ome of the Drugs, what Effect
they might have had, &s;he was as ill able to
know, as any Body el&s;e was to tell her; &s;he
might have &s;poiled her &s;elf for ought &s;he knew;
nor was &s;he able to give him any A&s;&s;urance
that it was not &s;o.</P>
<P>THIS left him very unea&s;y, and, as I &s;aid
above, he did not fail to let her know it,
which extremely afflicted her; for though, as
above, he was a very kind Husband yet it
<PB N="146" REF="162">
was a Thing &s;o very di&s;obliging, and &s;hewed &s;uch
a Contempt of him, when he was by all po&s;&s;ible
means endearing him&s;elf to her, &s;o that he re|&s;ented
it exceedingly.</P>
<P>UNDER this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Circum&s;tance of her
Affairs, and dreading the being expo&s;ed, as a|bove,
by her Husband's bringing it before the
Parliament, though he was &s;oon &s;atisfied the
Hou&s;e would not have engaged in it one Way
or other, unle&s;s it had been to vote it &s;can|dalous,
which would have done him no &s;er|vice
at all; I &s;ay, in this Di&s;tre&s;s her Cou&s;in
came to Town, and &s;he no &s;ooner heard of it,
but &s;he flies to her; and their fir&s;t Meeting
produced the following Di&s;cour&s;e:</P>

a very innocent thing; it would have done you

<P>I believe it did; for I had no &s;oon|er

<P>Yes, yes, I remember it particularly.</P>

within you, when you know how I urged
you again&s;t it &s;o earne&s;tly, and told you 'twas
wilful Murther?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but you did give me the Di|rections.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, let any Phy&s;ician &s;ee it; I'll

<P>We will go to Dr.&mdash;then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my Heart.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to this Agreement they went
to the Doctor, and he read the Particulars: He
a&s;&s;ured her, that he who gave her the Medicine
to cau&s;e Abortion, or prevent Conceptin, or
to do a breeding Woman the lea&s;t harm, de|ceived
her; for that there was nothing in it
but what a Woman with Child might freely
take without the lea&s;t Danger, and that no|thing
in the Medicine could do her the lea&s;t
Injury.</P>
<P>THIS gave the Lady her &s;elf full &s;ati&s;|faction,
and made her very ea&s;y: But &s;he did
not &s;ee any room to bring this Part about with
Mr.&mdash;her Husband, for that his Re&s;ent|ments
were run high, and he grew warm at but
the mention of the Thing; but &s;he thought to
<PB N="150" REF="166">
tell him all this Story would but lay the Weight
heavy upon her &s;elf, &s;o &s;he re&s;olved to let it
re&s;t where it was, and wait the I&s;&s;ue. And thus
&s;he wore out, as I &s;aid, above two Years, tho'
with many hard Struggles and frequent Re|proaches
from her Husband, who was extreamly
&s;oured in his Temper by it, and did not &s;tick
to u&s;e her hardly enough about it upon all Oc|ca&s;ions.</P>
<P>AT la&s;t, to her particular &s;atisfaction, and
his too, &s;he proved with Child indeed, and that
put an End to it all, for it removed the grand
&s;u&s;picion, that &s;he had poi&s;oned or vitiated her
Womb, &s;o that &s;he could never conceive, and
&s;he &s;till wi&s;hed to have no Children, which in|deed
was the rever&s;e of her Ca&s;e now; for &s;he
earne&s;tly de&s;ired to be with Child, to put an
End to all the&s;e Di&s;&s;atisfactions. And thus
ended this melancholy Affair.</P>
<P>FROM the whole Story, u&s;eful Ob&s;ervations
may be made very appo&s;ite to the Ca&s;e before
us. The wretched Humour of de&s;iring not to
be with Child, appears here in its proper light.
How direct a Crime it is in its &s;elf, is proved
from the Office of Matrimony, which is GOD'S
holy Ordinance, appointed and in&s;tituted by
him&s;elf for the regular Propagation of the Spe|cies.</P>
<P>THE Argument again&s;t taking Medicines to
prevent or de&s;troy Conception, which is the
&s;ame thing, is very ju&s;t; &s;ince, in the Nature
of the Crime, it is as much a real Murther to
de&s;troy the one as the other, as it is as much a
real Murther to kill a little Boy as a full grown
Man.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="167">
WHAT then are tho&s;e People doing who talk
of Phy&s;ick to prevent their being with Child?
It is, in &s;hort, neither more or le&s;s than a
&s;tated, premeditated Murther; and let tho&s;e
that act &s;o con&s;ider of it, and come off of the
Charge of Murtherers, if they can.</P>
<P>I could illu&s;trate this by &s;everal other Stories
or Relations of Matters of Fact, but I have not
room to &s;pare on that Head. A certain Lady of
noted Fame, is, I hear, making her &s;elf more
than ordinarily remarkable upon this very
Principle, and a&s;&s;ures the World, that &s;he not
only thinks it lawful to wi&s;h &s;he &s;hould have
no Children, but to u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible Means to
prevent it; nay, &s;he declares, as I am told,
that &s;he not only thinks it no Injury to any
Body; but that it is far from being a Crime to
de&s;troy the Birth or Embrio conceived within
her, and that &s;he has frequently done it.</P>
<P>HERE &s;he learnedly enlarges in her Di&s;cour&s;e,
(for &s;he is open enough upon that Subject) and
di&s;putes upon the Que&s;tion, Whether it is a
Sin to kill any Thing which has not a Soul?
And when &s;he thinks &s;he has conquered the
Difficulty, and has proved that every Creature
may be de&s;troyed by Man, that has not in it
a human Soul, &s;he brings it down to the Ca&s;e in
hand: She &s;ays, that it is no Offence to GOD or
Man, to de&s;troy a Cat, or Dog, or any other &s;uch
Creature, tho' it be not for Food, and tho' it be
done arbitrarily, without any provocation given
or hurt done by the Creature, but even if it were
in &s;port.</P>
<P>THEN, I &s;ay, bringing it down to the pre|&s;ent
Affair of a Child conceived in a Womb,
&s;he begins a new Enquiry, which the learned
Anatomi&s;ts, and the mo&s;t skilled in the Pro|ductions
<PB N="152" REF="168">
and Operations of Nature, have not
yet been able to determine, namely, When,
and after what particular Time, and in what
Manner the Embrio or Body of a Child con|ceived
in a Woman receives the addition of a
Soul? How the Union is made? And when the
Infu&s;ion of Soul is appointed.</P>
<P>THIS &s;he determines to be at a certain Time,
and de&s;cants critically upon it, in order to e&s;ta|bli&s;
the cur&s;ed Hypothe&s;is of her own Inven|tion,
<HI>viz.</HI> that all the while the <HI>Foetus</HI> is form|ing,
and the Embrio or Conception is proceed|ing,
even to the Moment that the Soul is infu|&s;ed,
&s;o long it is ab&s;olutely not in her Power
only, but in her Right, to kill or keep alive,
&s;ave, or de&s;troy the Thing &s;he goes with, &s;he won't
call it Child; and that therefore till then &s;he
re&s;olves to u&s;e all manner of Art; nay, &s;he does
not confine her &s;elf to human Art, to the help
of Drugs and Phy&s;icians, whether A&s;tringents,
Diureticks, Emeticks, or of whatever kind,
nay, even to Purgations, Potions, Poi&s;ons, or
any thing that Apothecaries or Druggi&s;ts can
&s;upply: But &s;he goes farther, and joins with
the Poet, nay, &s;he has the Words at her Tongue's
End from that famed Author, tho' in another
Ca&s;e,
<Q>Acheronta Movebo.</Q></P>
<P>IN <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;he tells them plainly, if Drugs
and Medicine fail her, &s;he will call to the De|vil
for help, and if Spells, Filtres, Charms,
Witchera&s;t, or all the Powers of Hell would
bring it about for her, &s;he would not &s;cruple
to make u&s;e of them for her re&s;olved Pur|po&s;e;
highly approving of that known <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Proverb, &s;uited to the ordinary Occa&s;ions only
<PB N="153" REF="169">
of u&s;ing dangerous Medicines from Quacks,
and unpracti&s;ed, unacquainted Hands; I &s;ay,
the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Proverb, (<HI>viz.</HI>)</P>
<Q>Let the Cure be wrought, though the <HI>Devil</HI> be
the Doctor.</Q>
<P>NOW this is an Example flagrant, and, as
I &s;aid, notorious, her Practice comes up to
the heighth of it, or el&s;e &s;he is le&s;s a <HI>Devil</HI>
than &s;he pretends to be, and boa&s;ts of being
much wickeder than &s;he really is; in which
Ca&s;e, I mu&s;t own my &s;elf to be of the Opinion
of the learned and witty Dr. <HI>Fuller, viz.</HI> that
he that openly profe&s;&s;es to be wickeder than
he really is in fact, is really and e&s;&s;entially,
whether in fact or no, as wicked as he pro|fe&s;&s;es
to be.</P>
<P>BUT, not to di&s;pute with this She-murtherer,
for it is not my Bu&s;ine&s;s here to decide either of
her Que&s;tions, Either when the Soul is infu&s;ed
into the Embrio in the Womb of her that is
with Child, or whether it is le&s;s criminal to
de&s;troy one than the other; I &s;ay, not to di&s;|pute
with a Murtherer, I am to go on with the
Relation, <HI>viz.</HI> that &s;he profe&s;&s;es the lawfulne&s;s,
and owns &s;he practi&s;es it, though not the la&s;t &s;o
freely as the fir&s;t. Let us enter a little into the
Circum&s;tances and Character of a Woman that
does thus; that the Picture being &s;et in a fair
View, tho&s;e who&s;e Blood is le&s;s inflamed with
the Rage of Hell, may look a little before
them, and con&s;ider, before they act the inhu|man
Part with them&s;elves, what they are do|ing
or going to do, and what they may rea|&s;onably
&s;uppo&s;e to be the Con&s;equence.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="170">
FIRST, The&s;e de&s;perate Medicines which
are u&s;ually taken for &s;uch Purpo&s;es, what are
they, and of what Kind? Have they an effect
only upon that particular Part which they are
pointed at? Are they able to confine the Opera|tion
of the Phy&s;ick to the very mathematical
Point of Situation? And &s;hall the Poi&s;ons ex|tend
no farther? Are they &s;ure they &s;hall af|fect
no Part but the Conception? Shall the
Phy&s;ick, like a Me&s;&s;enger &s;ent upon a particular
Bu&s;ine&s;s, knock at no Doors in his Journey
going or coming? Shall it affect no other
Part? Shall the murthering Dart kill ju&s;t the
Part, &s;trike a mortal Wound ju&s;t there, and no
where el&s;e, and innocently pa&s;&s;ing by every
other Place, do no more than ju&s;t the Errand
'tis &s;ent about.</P>
<P>WHAT if you &s;hould mi&s;take, and the Ap|plication
being mi&s;placed, the Arrow &s;hold
mi&s;s the Child, and kill the Mother? I have
heard of a certain Quack in this Town, and
knew him too, who profe&s;s'd to pre&s;cribe in
this very Ca&s;e; the Villain, for he mu&s;t be
no other, had his Preparations of the &s;everal
following particular Kinds, are for the &s;everal
following Operations, and accoridingly, gave
the Directions to his Patients, as follows:</P>
<P>&startq;N^o. 1. IF the Party or Woman be young with

<P>I need give no Vouchers for this Account;
there are Peple &s;till living, who &s;ent &s;everal
poor Servants to him, pretending this or that
Part to be their Ca&s;e, and craving his learned

<P>BUT I leave the Mountebank, my Bu&s;ine&s;s is
with the unhappy Ladies, who venture upon
the&s;e dark Doings, in pur&s;uit of the wicked De|&s;ign
again&s;t Child-bearing; they run great ri&s;ques
in taking &s;uch Medicines; and 'tis great odds
but that, fir&s;t or la&s;t, they Ruin them&s;elves by
it. This Wretch of a Quack could, it &s;eems,
kill the Child or the Mother, which he plea&s;ed;
and you may, by a wrong Application, do both,
kill the Child and the Mother both at once,
and &s;o be a Self-murther, and a murtherer of
your own Offspring both together; at lea&s;t, 'tis
an Article worth a little of the Lady's Thought
when &s;he goes abut &s;uch a doubtful Piece of
Work as this is; and if &s;he &s;hould come to a
Mi&s;chance, &s;he wold perhaps &s;upport the Re|proach
of it but very hardly; I mean, if
&s;he has any re&s;erves of Con&s;cience and Re|flection
about her.</P>
<P>AGAIN: If it does not reach her Life, it
goes another length without Remedy; &s;he poi|&s;ons
her Body, &s;he locks up Natue, &s;he damns
her &s;elf to a certain and eternal Barrenne&s;s for
the Time to come; and as boldly, as &s;he &s;ays,
&s;he de&s;ires it to be &s;o, does not value it, and the
like. She might con&s;ider, that it may &s;o hap|pen
that &s;he may alter her Mind; nay, &s;he
may come to the Extream the other Way, and
I have more than once, nay, very often, known
it to be &s;o.</P>
<P>NOR is it improbable but that her Mind may
be the mo&s;t likely to alter, when &s;he knows &s;he
is brought to an impo&s;&s;ibility of altering it.
Nothing is more frequent than for a Woman
to reject what &s;he may have, when &s;he may
<PB N="157" REF="173">
have it, and long and wi&s;h for it when it can
be no more obtained; the de&s;ires (of that Kind
e&s;pecially) are generally very impetuous; the
Stream runs rapid and furious; and if &s;he
&s;hould come to be as de&s;irous of Children as &s;he
may be now to de&s;troy them, 'tis odds but the
violence of that De&s;ire turns a Di&s;temper, and
that to &s;uch a degree, as may be very trou|ble&s;ome
as well as dangerous, and often proves
mortal.</P>
<P>SOLOMON &s;ays of the Grave and the Barren
Womb, <HI>that they are never &s;atisfied;</HI> they never
&s;ay, it is enough: And what an Object will
&s;uch a Woman be, and, under &s;uch Reflections,
either by her &s;elf, or by others, that torments
her &s;elf, and perhaps &s;ome Body el&s;e, to be
with Child, after &s;he has already dried up the
Juices, &s;tagnated the Blood, and fettered Na|ture,
&s;o as that no &s;uch Powers are left by which
the Operation can be performed.</P>
<P>THE Lady I mention indeed, laughs at all
the&s;e Things, and bids defiance even to GOD
and Nature, contemns Con&s;equences, and &s;corns
the &s;uppo&s;ition of a change of Mind, and a re|turn
of De&s;ires; from whence I infer only this,
<HI>viz.</HI> That &s;he knows little what Nature means;
what go on till &s;he comes to be her own Puni&s;h|ment,
her own Tormentor, and to expo&s;e her
&s;elf as much in one Extream as &s;he does now
in another; and if that &s;hould never happen, it
will be only &s;aid of her as it has been of many
a Criminal of a wor&s;e kind, <HI>viz.</HI> that &s;he died
impenitent.</P>
<P>BUT to go back from the Per&s;on to the
Thing, for Examples import nothing, but as
<PB N="158" REF="174">
they confirm the &s;ubject, the Story may plea&s;e,
but'tis the improvement of the Story, that &s;ixes
the Truth of the Argument, which it is brought
to &s;upport: This horrid Practice, I mean, of
applying to extrardinary Means to de&s;troy
the Conception, has yet many Things to be
&s;aid to it.</P>
<P>AS it poi&s;ons the Body, and, as I have
&s;aid, locks up Nature; &s;o let me remind the
Ladies who&s;e Vanity prompts them to the
Practice, e&s;pecially too if they have any &s;uch
thing as Religion about them, that 'tis a kind
of cur&s;ing their own Bodies, 'tis Bla&s;ting them|&s;elves;
and as they take upon them to do it
them&s;elves, how ju&s;t would it be, if Heaven,
taking them at their Words, lays it home far|ther
than they would wi&s;h or intend it? And
that &s;eeing they de&s;ire to bear no Fruit,
Heaven &s;hould &s;ay, in the Words of our Saviour
to the Fig-Tree, <HI>No Fruit grow on thee hencefor|ward
for ever.</HI></P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be a Temper unu&s;ually hardened,
that could bear &s;uch a Bla&s;t from above with|out
&s;ome Horror: Let any Lady, I mean Chri|&s;tian
Lady, for I direct my Speech now to &s;uch,
though they may be ignorantly or ra&s;hly
pu&s;hed on by the Folly of their Circum&s;tances;
I &s;ay, let any Chri&s;tian Lady tell me, if &s;he
&s;hould hear tho&s;e Words really and audibly
pronounced from Heaven to her, could &s;he look
up with &s;atisfaction, take it for a Ble&s;&s;ing, and
&s;ay, <HI>Amen?</HI> I cannot but hope we have very
few of the mo&s;t audacious Athei&s;ts among us,
could go the length.</P>
<P>AND now I have accidentally named that

for &s;o I under&s;tand it, however, that Lan|guage
<PB N="159" REF="175">
is pretty much unknown among us, I
could almo&s;t venture to put in a grave Word to
the Ladies that marry, and would have no
Children; tho&s;e prepo&s;terous, not unthinking
but ill-thinking Ladies, I &s;ay, that will marry
but would have no Children; as 'tis mo&s;t cer|tain
that they expo&s;e their Mode&s;ty in it, &s;o they
likewi&s;e expo&s;e their Chri&s;tianity; and let me
ask them but this &s;hort Que&s;tion; Pray, Ma|dam,
what Religion are you of?</P>
<P>BY asking after the Lady's Religion, I do
not mean whether Prote&s;tant or Papi&s;t, Church
of <HI>England Presbyterian,</HI> but whether <HI>Chri|&s;tian</HI>
or <HI>Pagan,</HI> a wor&s;hipper of GOD, or of the
Devil; of one GOD or a thou&s;and Gods, nominal
Gods; in a word, have you, Madam, any &s;uch
Thing as Religion about you? It is indeed a
Que&s;tion, which, in a Chri&s;tian Nation, &s;hould
pa&s;s for an Affront; but when People act
counter to Principle, and counter to Profe&s;&s;ion,
they open the Door to the Que&s;tion, nay, they
make it rational and nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>BUT I will &s;uppo&s;e the Lady &s;hall an&s;wer, I
am a Chri&s;tian, and a Prote&s;tant.</P>
<P>WELL, Madam, then you will allow me to
&s;ay, that &s;ometimes you pray to GOD, or, to
give it you in the Language of the Moderns,
you &s;ay your Prayers.</P>
<P>YES I do, <HI>&s;ays the Lady;</HI> and what then?</P>
<P>WHY then, Madam, you &s;uppo&s;e, or grant,
that GOD can hear you, when you &s;ay your
Prayers?</P>
<P>YES, I know he can, <HI>&s;ays &s;he;</HI> what then?</P>
<P>WHY then, Madam, you believe he will an|&s;wer
your Prayers too, and grant your Reque&s;ts
al&s;o, becau&s;e he has promi&s;ed he will, if what we
ask be agreeable to his Will, 1 <HI>John</HI> v. 14.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="176">
WELL&mdash;! And what do you gather front
all this? <HI>&s;ays the Lady.</HI></P>
<P>GATHER, Madam; why, I gather this, that
as you are a married Woman, and would fain
be Barren, and have no Children, never give
your &s;elf any trouble about Phy&s;ick, and tak|ing
Drugs to prevent Conception; but knee|down,
and very humbly and &s;incerely pray to
GOD to cur&s;e you with Barrenne&s;s: Tell him,
that you are one of his Creatures who HE, at
HIS fir&s;t Ble&s;&s;ing Mankind, had allowed to en|crea&s;e
and multiply, but that you de&s;ire no
&s;hare in that Ble&s;&s;ing; and &s;o beg, that he would
be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to bla&s;t the Child you go
with, if you are with Child, and &s;hut up your
Womb, if you are not; for that you de&s;ire none
of his Ble&s;tings of that Kind.</P>
<P>IF the Lady I have been &s;peaking to above,
is, as &s;he &s;ays, a Chri&s;tian, and prays to GOD
at any time; if &s;he knows and believes that
GOD knows her Thoughts, can hear Pray|ers,
and will grant her Reque&s;t, if it be <HI>accord|ing
to his Will;</HI> let her, I &s;ay, if &s;he can do thus
without trembling at the Thoughts of it, go to
her Knees, and pray devoutly that &s;he may
have no more Children, or no Children.</P>
<P>IF GOD is &s;o merciful to her, as to deny the
vile, wicked Reque&s;t, &s;he ought to be very
thankful that her Prayers are not heard; but
if it &s;hould be granted, &s;he mu&s;t and ought,
with the &s;ame humility, to acknowledge 'tis
righteous and ju&s;t, and that the Judgment, for
&s;uch it mu&s;t be, is of her own procuring.</P>
<P>THIS would be putting the Matter to a &s;hort
I&s;&s;ue; and we &s;hould &s;ee whether the Ladies are
&s;erious enough to carry their Folly to &s;uch a
highth, or no.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="177">
BUT there is another Length that &s;ome of
the&s;e Ladies go, and this indeed carries Things
beyond all the &s;ugge&s;tions of my Title; in&s;tead
of Matrimonial Whoredom it &s;hould be cal|led
Matrimonial Witchcraft; the Truth is, I
dare not enter into Examples here, no not
where I may have &s;ome Rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, nay,
to believe, nay, where I have been informed
it has been &s;o, becau&s;e I would not point out
any One as Criminal to &s;uch a degree, unle&s;s
the Fact was as plain, as admitted a Conviction
in the way of Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>NAY, when my Friend <HI>M&mdash;R&mdash;</HI> a&s;|&s;ured
me, that his next Neighbour Mrs. <HI>G&mdash;W&mdash;</HI>
boa&s;ted in Publick, that &s;he intended
to do &s;o and &s;o, nay, though I heard her own
&s;he had done it; yet, as the Witches in <HI>New
England</HI> went &s;o far in acknowledging their
own Guilt, and their familiarity with the
<HI>Devil,</HI> that at la&s;t they could not obtain to be
Hanged, no not upon their own Evidence, or
be believed upon their own Confe&s;&s;ion; &s;o I
cannot per&s;uade my &s;elf to tell you, that I be|lieve
Madam <HI>W&mdash;</HI> really guilty of &s;o much
Wickedne&s;s as &s;he pretends to, or that &s;he de|&s;erves
the Gallows &s;o eminently as &s;he boa&s;ts
&s;he does.</P>
<P>TO go to the Devil to prevent GOD's Ble&s;|&s;ing!
I mu&s;t confefs 'tis very audacious; and if
Providence takes no particular Notice of &s;uch,
and gives no publick Te&s;timony of Re&s;entment,
it would &s;eem very &s;trange to me; I &s;hould only
&s;ay, there is the more behind, the Wretches have
the more to expect; let 'em think of it.</P>
<P>SOME will tell us, there is nothing in it; that
really the Devil has no Power to do any thing
in it, one way or other, and that all the No|tions
<PB N="162" REF="178">
of Charm, Spell, Filtres, Magick Knots,
&amp;<HI>c.</HI> are Jugglers Tricks, and have nothing in
them; they reach the Fancy indeed, and af|fect
the Imaginations of weak, vapouri&s;h Peo|ple;
but that really the&s;e Things are out of
the Devil's way, and that he knows nothing of
the Matter, and can do nothing to help or hinder;
that the Devil has no skill in Midwifry, and
can neither tell a Woman when &s;he is with
Child, or when &s;he is not; he can no more
make her Mi&s;carry, unle&s;s it is by frighting
her, than he can make her Conceive; that 'tis
all a Cheat, contrived by a Gang of artful
Knaves to get Money, pick Pockets, and de|ceive
the ignorant Women.</P>
<P>HOW far this may be true or not, I leave to
tho&s;e that are well enough acquainted with
the <HI>Devil,</HI> to know how, and to what De|gree,
he can or does act in the&s;e Ca&s;es. But
the Crime of tho&s;e People that go to him for
his help, is the &s;ame, whether he can a&s;&s;i&s;t
them or not; with the addition of Fool, if he
cannot.</P>
<P>I might ask here, whether this Practice is
con&s;i&s;tent with Hone&s;ty? As for Religion, Mo|de&s;ty
and Reputation, that I think I have men|tioned
to &s;atisfaction; but as to the Hone&s;ty of
it, there is &s;omething more to be &s;aid: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI>
as i &s;aid above; to a Husband it cannot be
hone&s;t by any means: We'll &s;uppo&s;e the Man
to be an hone&s;t, &s;ober and religious Husband;
he married, no doubt, as Men of hone&s;t Prin|ciples,
and of the utmo&s;t Mode&s;ty, do, that is,
in view of rain&s;ing up a Family as well to inhe|rit
his E&s;tate, &s;uppo&s;ing that Part to be &s;uffi|cient,
as to pre&s;erve a Name and a Po&s;terity,
as other Gentlemen do.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="179">
FINDING his Wife barren, at fir&s;t he prays
heartily, as he may do lawfully, that he may be
fruitful, and have Children. Mark the Harmony!
he prays for having Children, and &s;he prays
again&s;t any; he looks up to Heaven to entreat
he may be ble&s;s'd and encreas'd; &s;he goes to the
Devil for help, that his Prayers may be fru|&s;trated;
he marries in expectation of Children;
&s;he marries him, but endeavours by all the hel|li&s;h,
diabolick Arts and Tricks &s;he can to pre|vent
it, and di&s;appoint him. And where is the
Hone&s;ty of all this, pray? At lea&s;t, how is &s;he
ju&s;t to her Husband?</P>
<P>IF &s;he had told him of it before Marriage,
it had altered the Ca&s;e; or if &s;he had acquainted
him with it when &s;he did thus, and he had con|&s;ented,
it had been another Thing; at lea&s;t, as
it regarded him, there had been no Inju&s;tice in
it, becau&s;e of his voluntary a&s;&s;ent to it: But
then it is fooli&s;h to &s;ugge&s;t, for no Man in his
Sen&s;es would ever agree to &s;uch a ridiculous
Propo&s;al, and therefore 'tis highly di&s;hone&s;t
and unju&s;t to her Husband.</P>
<P>IT is likewi&s;e an immoral Action in it &s;elf,
as it is incon&s;i&s;tent with the Rea&s;on and Nature
of Things, and cla&s;hes with &s;everal &s;tated Rules
of Life, which are of divine In&s;titution. But that
is not, as I &s;aid before, the proper View of this
Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>AS it is not hone&s;t or moral, &s;o, on the other
hand, it &s;eems not to con&s;i&s;t with the Character
of a mode&s;t and virtuous Woman: If a Whore
acted thus, I &s;hould not wonder at all; for her
Bu&s;ine&s;s is to conceal her immode&s;t, criminal
Conver&s;ation, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to hide her
Shame; for her to apply to Phy&s;icians and
Apothecaries, take Drops and Draughts, and
<PB N="164" REF="180">
Phy&s;ick her &s;elf from Day to Day, I &s;hould
make no Wonder at it; 'tis what her Circum|&s;tances
make not rational only but nece&s;|&s;ary.</P>
<P>BUT for an hone&s;t Woman! openly and law|fully
married! who&s;e Husband is publickly
known; who lives with, and acknowledges her
to be his Wife, and Beds with her, as we call it,
every Night; for this Woman to de&s;ire to be
Barren, much more to endeavour to prevent,
or, which is the &s;ame Thing, to de&s;troy the
Conception, bla&s;t the Fruit of her own Body,
poi&s;on her Blood, and ruin her Con&s;titution,
that &s;he may have no Children! This can have
nothing in it but Witchcraft and the Devil;
'tis &s;candalous to the la&s;t Degree; 'tis &s;eeking
the Man meerly as &s;uch, meerly for the <HI>frailer
Part,</HI> as my Lord <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> calls it, and that
brings it down to my Subject, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the Lewdne&s;s
of it, which entitles it, in my Opinion, to that
I call Matrimonial Whoredom.</P>
<P>THEY may gild it over with what Pretences
they will; they may u&s;e their Female Rheto|rick
to &s;et it off, and to cover it; &s;uch as fear of
the Dangers and Pains of a hard Travail, weak|ne&s;s
of Con&s;titution, hereditary Mi&s;carriages,
and &s;uch like. But tho&s;e Things are all an&s;wer|ed
with a Que&s;tion, Why then, Madam, did you
marry? Seeing all this was known before, they
were as &s;olid Rea&s;ons for not marrying, as they
can be now for not breeding. But the Lady,
as above, would venture all to have the u&s;e of
the Man; and as for her Rea&s;ons why &s;he
would have no Children, &s;he mu&s;t account for
them another Way.</P>
<P>HAD the Lady been with Child, and had a
dangerous Travail; had &s;he been frequently
<PB N="165" REF="181">
with Child, but always &s;ubject to Abortions, or
con&s;tant and dangerous Mi&s;carriages; had &s;he
received any hurt in the Delivery of her former
Children, which threatned Dangers if &s;he came
again; or had &s;everal other Circum&s;tances at|tended
her, le&s;s proper to mention than tho&s;e;
had &s;he been abu&s;ed by Midwives, or weaken'd
by Di&s;tempers or Di&s;a&s;ters, this would alter the
Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT the Circum&s;tance I in&s;i&s;t upon is, when
the Woman marries, takes a Man to Bed to her,
with all the Circum&s;tances that are to be under|&s;tood,
without obliging us to expre&s;s them; lives
with him, and lies with him every Night, and
yet profe&s;&s;es to de&s;ire &s;he may have no Chil|dren:
The&s;e are the Circum&s;tances I in&s;i&s;t upon,
the Aggravations of which admit no abate|ment,
and for which I do not know one mode&s;t
Word of Excu&s;e can be &s;aid. This is what I
call <HI>Conjugal Lewdne&s;s,</HI> nor can I &s;ee any thing
el&s;e in it; 'twas the plain End of her marrying;
'tis in vain to call it by other Names, and cover
it with other Excu&s;es; 'tis nothing but Whoring
under the &s;helter or cover of the Law, we may
paint it out, and dre&s;s it up as we will.</P>

the Obedience &s;eems to be more limited than in
any other, and therefore I may go farther here
than I would do in any of the Points of Subor|dination
in other Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>IT is a Maxim in Law as well as in Rea&s;on,
there is no Duty in Obeying where there is
no Authority to Command; or, if you will,
thus: There is no Obligation to Obey where
there is no Right to Command; the Parent
has, no que&s;tion, a right to Command, nay, to
goveru and over-rule the Child in all lawful
Things: But if the Parent commands the
Child to do an unlawful Action, the Child may
decline it; for a Thing cannot be lawful and
unlawful at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>IT is evident in the Ca&s;e before me, if the
Parent commands his Child to marry &s;uch or
&s;uch a Per&s;on, and the Child either cannot love
the Per&s;on, or at the &s;ame time declares he or
&s;he is engaged in Affection to another, the
<PB N="168" REF="184">
Command of the Parent cannot be lawfully
obeyed, becau&s;e it is unlawful for the Child to
marry any Per&s;on he or &s;he cannot love; nay,
the very doing it is de&s;tructive of Matrimony,
and they mu&s;t either lie one way or other, or
el&s;e they cannot obey it, for they cannot be mar|ried:
For example,</P>
<P>A Father &s;ays to his Son, I would have you
marry &s;uch a young Lady.</P>
<P>OH! Sir, &s;ays the Son, I beg of you don't
de&s;ire of it me, &s;he is a Woman that of all the
Women in the World, I would not marry upon
any Account whatever.</P>
<P>DON'T tell me you will not marry her, &s;ays
the Father, I have good Rea&s;ons for your hav|ing
her.</P>
<P>BUT, Sir, &s;ays the Son, I hope you won't
in&s;i&s;t upon it; for I can't do it.</P>
<P>WHAT do you mean? You can't do it, &s;ays
the Father angrily.</P>
<P>WHY, Sir, <HI>&s;ays the Son,</HI> I can't love her.</P>
<P>O, well; you mu&s;t venture that, &s;ays the
Father, marry her fir&s;t, and you'll love her af|terwards.</P>
<P>INDEED, I can't marry upon that Foot Sir,
<HI>&s;ays the Son,</HI> but re&s;pectfully, it would be a Sin
to marry a Woman I can't love.</P>
<P>I tell you, <HI>&s;ays the Father,</HI> I have &s;ingled her
out for you, and I expect you &s;hould have
her.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry, Sir, you &s;hould choo&s;e a Wife
for me, <HI>&s;ays the Son,</HI> and never let me know
it.</P>
<P>I think 'tis your Duty to &s;ubmit, <HI>&s;ays the
Father,</HI> as long as I think &s;he is a &s;uitable Match
for you, and for the Family.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="185">
BUT, Sir, <HI>&s;ays the Son,</HI> 'tis impo&s;&s;ible: I can
never be married to her; no Clergyman dares
marry me to her.</P>
<P>WHAT d'ye mean by that? <HI>&s;ays his Father.</HI></P>
<P>WHY, Sir, <HI>&s;ays the Son,</HI> either I mu&s;t Lie and
be For&s;worn, or he can't marry me, and I hope
you would not de&s;ire me either to Lie, or to be
Perjured.</P>
<P>DON'T tell me of Lying and Perjury, &s;ays
the pa&s;&s;ionate Father, I don't enquire into your
impertinent Cavils, I tell you, &s;he will make a
very good Wife for you, and I &s;ay, you &s;hall
have her.</P>
<P>WELL, Sir, &s;ays the Son, if you can make
any Mini&s;ter marry me to her.</P>
<P>WHAT is it you mean, &s;ays the Father,
to offer &s;uch Stuff to me? If you don't take
her, it &s;hall be wor&s;e for you; I tell you, you
&s;hall have her.</P>
<P>WHY, Sir, &s;ays the Son, when he asks me,
if I will take her? I may an&s;wer, <HI>I Will:</HI> But
when he comes to &s;ay, <HI>Wilt thou love her?</HI> I
mu&s;t &s;ay, <HI>I Will not;</HI> I mu&s;t lie, if I &s;hould
&s;ay, <HI>I Will;</HI> and if he can marry me &s;o, let
him.</P>
<P>I don't make a Je&s;t of it Son, <HI>&s;ays the Fa|ther,</HI>
I expect you go and wait upon her,
for I will have you marry her, I tell you.</P>
<P>THUS the Father laid it upon him hard; he
put it off with this a great while, that he
could not love her; but the Father in&s;i&s;ted up|on
it, and threatened to di&s;inherit him; and &s;o
he wickedly complied, married the Woman
he hated, and for&s;ook a young Lady that loved
him, and that he was in love with; and he
was unhappy, and cur&s;ed his Marriage to his
dying Day; and &s;o was the Woman he married
<PB N="170" REF="186">
al&s;o. Indeed, he did not go &s;o far as the Son
did in the Example I gave you before; he did
not marry them both, but he was very un|happy.</P>
<P>THE Limits of a Parent's Authority, in this
Ca&s;e of Matrimony, either with Son or Daugh|ter,
I think, &s;tands thus: The Negative, I think,
is theirs, e&s;pecially with a Daughter; but, I
think, the Po&s;itive is the Childrens.</P>
<P>IF the Child looks Retrograde, and would
throw her &s;elf away upon a Scoundrel, upon her
Father's Coachman, or Book-keeper, or upon
any thing unworthy of the Family and For|tune
of the Lady, much more if the Per&s;on
&s;he inclines to marry is &s;candalous, a Man of
Vice, a Man of an ill Character, a Drunkard,
a Game&s;ter, a Rake, or what el&s;e is to be called
&s;candalous, the Father, or Mother, or next
Parent or Guardian may, I believe with Ju&s;tice,
interpo&s;e their Authority, and may command
her not to take &s;uch or &s;uch a Per&s;on, the Fa|ther
may put the Negative upon her; nor is it
&s;ufficient for her to &s;ay, &s;he loves the Man, or
is in love with the Man.</P>
<P>BUT when the &s;ame Father or Parent comes
and directs her the &s;aid Daughter, and &s;ays po&s;i|tively,
you &s;hall marry &s;uch or &s;uch a Man who|ther
you love him or not; there, I think, the Ca&s;e
differs extreamly; and the young Lady telling
them, &s;he does not like the Man, that &s;he can|not
love him, and won't marry him for that
Rea&s;on, is a ju&s;tifiable Rea&s;on, and &s;he ought
not to be forced: Or, if &s;he &s;ays, that &s;he is in
love with another, and that other is not yet
di&s;covered, 'tis neverthele&s;s a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on,
and &s;he ought not to be forced; nor can the
Command of a Father or Mother, bind her to
<PB N="171" REF="187">
marry the Man &s;he cannot love, becau&s;e it
would be an unlawful Action, unju&s;t and inju|rious
both to the Man and to her &s;elf; and no
Command of a Parent can be obliging upon
her, to do an unlawful or unju&s;t Action.</P>
<P>THE Parent therefore may command her not
to marry this or that Per&s;on, but may not
command her to marry any particular Per&s;on,
who &s;he declares her &s;elf not to love; for this
would be to command her to lie, and be for|&s;worn,
in the expre&s;s Terms of the Marriage
Contract.</P>
<P>AGAIN; it were to be wi&s;hed, that every
one that marries before they fix their Affection
&s;incerely upon the Per&s;on they are to have,
would con&s;ider what I ju&s;t mentioned above,
<HI>(viz.)</HI> the Wrong they do to the Per&s;on they
take; &s;uppo&s;e it be the Woman, who, at the
Book, they promi&s;e upon Oath <HI>to love,</HI> and yet
afterwards perhaps, tell them to their Faces,
they never loved them at all: This is an irre|trievable
Injury to the Per&s;on, who perhaps
was, as it were, &s;natched out of the Arms of
tho&s;e that did love her, and of another that
would have loved her, and who perhaps &s;he
loved al&s;o, and, per&s;uaded or over-ruled by Pa|rents,
to take one who pretended as much to
love as any one, but only took her for her
Money, and venturing upon tho&s;e Preten&s;ions,
&s;he or he is now deceived and di&s;appointed, the
Wrong is irreparable; the Lady that might, if
he had let her alone, been made happy, is a|bu&s;ed,
is made mi&s;erable, is injured in the
gro&s;&s;e&s;t manner, and he had much better have
ravi&s;hed her, and been hanged, as he de&s;erved;
I mean better for her; then &s;he had been free
again, and though &s;he had been abu&s;ed, the In|jury
<PB N="172" REF="188">
had been at an End; but here &s;he is abu&s;ed'
daily, the Crime is renewed, and &s;he is made
unhappy to the End of her Life.</P>
<P>THIS marrying without Affection, or con|trary
to Inclination, has a variety of compli|cated
Mi&s;chiefs attending it, and e&s;pecially con|&s;idering
that, upon the lea&s;t di&s;agreeablene&s;s
between the Per&s;ons married, former Objects,
and former Thoughts revive in the Mind;
they are always comparing their Condition
with what it might have been, with what
others are, and with what, at lea&s;t, they fancy
others are; ever repining at what is, ever wi&s;h|ing
what can never be. Every thing they
have is di&s;agreeable and unplea&s;ant; they look
on their Life as a Slave at <HI>Algier</HI> looks upon his
Chains, they fancy them&s;elves as Per&s;ons
only bought and &s;old, as Per&s;ons committed by
Warrant, and made Pri&s;oners for Life.</P>
<P>THE State they are in is imbittered by every
Circum&s;tance, and every Circum&s;tance imbit|tered
by the want of Affection, the Thing is
bad in it &s;elf, and want of Affection makes every
Part of it wor&s;e.</P>
<P>NOR is it probable that &s;uch a Marriage
&s;hould i&s;&s;ue otherwi&s;e; I had almo&s;t &s;aid it is
not po&s;&s;ible: But the Nature of the thing di|rects
it, and the di&s;agreeablene&s;s can hardly
fail to happen, becau&s;e there is not only no
Fund of Affection to build upon, but a kind
of a pre-ingaged Aver&s;ion, which is certain to
a&s;&s;i&s;t and to render every thing wor&s;e, rather
than better.</P>
<P>I could give a long Hi&s;tory of a Family,
within the compa&s;s of my own Ob&s;ervation,
where both the Man and the Woman were thus
&s;tated; that is to &s;ay, brought together by the
<PB N="173" REF="189">
Allurement of good Circum&s;tances, and the
over-ruling Directions of their immediate Go|vernors
and Friends; when, on both Sides, their
Choice and Affections were guided, at lea&s;t a|gain&s;t
the re&s;pective Object, if not to other
Objects; and though perhaps tho&s;e other Ob|jects
were not indeed &s;o &s;uitable as to Birth
and Fortune, for this Breach happened in a Fa|mily
of &s;ome Figure, and among that we call
Quality, yet the Choice they had made for them|&s;elves
had certainly been more &s;uitable to them
as Man and Woman, and had tended infinitely
more to their &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems they had frequently Rufflings
and Rencounters, as they might be called, upon
the Subject before; and as they went upon an old
Mob Rule, <HI>That few Words among Friends</HI> were
<HI>be&s;t,</HI> and <HI>tho&s;e very &s;pitsful;</HI> &s;o if they did fall
out, it was &s;hort, but bitter; and this Battle,
which I happened to have the following Ac|count
of, and which was one of the wor&s;t they
ever had, may pa&s;s for a Specimen:</P>
<P>IT happened to be at Supper, and the Gen|tleman
had drank to his Lady with a kind of
a &s;near and a bow, and <HI>My Service to your Lady|&s;hip</HI>
(for &s;he was a Lady). <HI>Ay, ay,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>Ser|vice!

and went out of the Room; but about the
u&s;ual time of going to Bed, they came a little
to them&s;elves again, and were preparing to go
to Bed, when a few Words ri&s;ing the Wind, it
blew up into another Storm, and they fell out
more furiou&s;ly than before.</P>
<P>SHE told him, &s;he had had but two Children,
and &s;he thanked GOD they were both dead.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="193">
HE told her, he de&s;ired no more of the
Breed.</P>
<P>SHE replied, &s;he de&s;ired all the World to
take notice, that if ever &s;he was with Child
again, it would be a Ba&s;tard, and none of his.</P>
<P>HE turned round from her, and bad her turn
her back to him.</P>
<P>SHE &s;aid, with all her Heart, and did &s;o.</P>
<P>NOW cur&s;e your &s;elf, &s;aid he, if ever you
turn your Face to me again.</P>
<P>SHE &s;aid, &s;he knew a better Way for it than
that; &s;o &s;he called her Maid, took her leave of
him, and went to Bed by her &s;elf.</P>
<P>THE Next Day &s;he took her Coach, and went
to a Relation's Hou&s;e, took &s;ome Jewels with
her, and &s;ent for her Cloaths. And thus ended
a <HI>Mother-Made Match</HI> on one hand, and a
<HI>Money-Made</HI> match on the other hand; On both
hands without Affection, and where they had
been mutually pre-ingaged to other Objects:
And what was all this, pray, but a Matrimonial
Whoredom!</P>
<P>IT would take up too much of this Work, to
give the &s;hort Hi&s;tory of the remaining Life of
the&s;e two pa&s;&s;ionate married Enemies, for &s;uch
they were. As they were People of good
Fa&s;hion and Figure, they might have quarrelled
with &s;ome re&s;erve to good Manners; but, on
the contrary, &s;he pur&s;ued him with all the
&s;pite and rage of her Tongue that it was po&s;|&s;ible
for a Woman to invent; &s;aid all the Bitter
and di&s;dainful Things of him that Ill-nature
could in&s;pire her with; &s;corned all the Motions
of Friends towards a Reconciliation to him, which
at fir&s;t he was not aver&s;e to; and, at la&s;t, gave
out, that he kept a Whore, and that &s;he intend|ed
to &s;ue him to a Divorce.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="194">
IN return, after he found her ob&s;tinate, he
put all the Contempt upon her he was able, and
in all Company where he could po&s;&s;ibly come at
her; made Ballads and Songs of her; and, in a
word, they took all po&s;&s;ible Ways on both Sides
to make it impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould ever come to|gether
again.</P>
<P>AFTER &s;ome Time, he went abroad into
<HI>France,</HI> when he did the &s;pitefulle&s;t Thing that
it was po&s;&s;ible for him to do, or that, I think,
a Man could ever do by a Wife: Being, (as he
had given out) at <HI>Paris,</HI> he caus'd a Rumour to
be rais'd that he was very Sick, and a little
after that he was Dead. This he carried &s;o far,
that his Servants and Dependents, who he left
at his Hou&s;e, were all put into Mourning, and
the Lady was firmly convinced that he was
Dead; nay, he employed a &s;ubtle, managing
Fellow, to come to the Hou&s;e where the Lady
lodged, to give an Account of his Death, and
that he was at the Funeral.</P>
<P>IN a word, Things were carried &s;o far, that
the Lady was courted by another Gentleman,
and, at length, con&s;ented to be married; but
all things being prepared for the Wedding; Set|tlements
made, the very Day come, and her
Friends about her, he &s;ends a Me&s;&s;enger to
tell her, that he was coming to the Church to
&s;ee her married, that he would have remained
in his Grave a little longer, but that he was
re&s;olved &s;he &s;hould not have &s;o much Plea&s;ure
as that of one Day's Delu&s;ion; and that he
would not do the Gentleman the Injury, of let|ting
him ignorantly marry a She-Devil, as he
had done.</P>
<P>THIS was managed &s;o wickedly, and with
&s;uch a keenne&s;s and severity of Spight, that it

almo&s;t co&s;t the Lady her Life; and it might
have gone farther, for the Gentleman was a&s;|fronted
&s;o, that he demanded Satisfaction of
him, and it went up to a Challenge; but &s;ome
Friends interpo&s;ed, &s;o that they did not fight.</P>
<P>THE enraged Lady fell &s;ick with Di&s;dain;
and the Fury that this Piece of Management put
her in was &s;uch, that &s;he continued langui&s;hing
near two Years, but then recovered. A great
many Friends interpo&s;ed, if po&s;&s;ible, to reconcile
them; but there was no room for that, it was
gone too far.</P>
<P>AT length they brought it to a Truce, tho'
they could not bring it to a Peace; they brought
them to an Agreement of Civility, <HI>viz.</HI> not to
In&s;ult or Affront one another any more; and
this was all they could ever be brought to; nor
was it ea&s;y to bring them to that, &s;o exa&s;perated
were they on both sides, &s;o irreconcileably pro|voked,
e&s;pecially the Woman.</P>
<P>THIS is one Example of a Marriage by force
of Friends, and by motives of Avarice and
Pride, where the Parties were pre-ingaged by
their Affection to other Objects. I could give
many In&s;tances in their degree equally unhap|py,
though perhaps not carried on to &s;uch an
extravagant Length, but all &s;erve to convince
us, how fatal it is for Men or Women to engage
their Per&s;ons one Way, and their Affections
another.</P>
<P>CERTAINLY tho&s;e People who have the
lea&s;t value for their own Ea&s;e, that expect any
Felicity in a married Life, &s;hould think before
they take this Leap in the Dark; I &s;ay, they
&s;hould think a little, how, in the Nature of the
thing, they can expect Happine&s;s in a Woman
they do not love; and in a Woman who they
<PB N="180" REF="196">
&s;hall be tied to live with while they Love ano|ther,
and &s;hall be Night and Day wi&s;hing their
beloved <HI>Rachel</HI> were in their Arms in&s;tead of
the blear-eyed <HI>Leah,</HI> which they have taken in
her Place.</P>
<P>BUT thus it is, and that too frequently to
wonder at, that Men love the Per&s;on they do
not marry, and marry the Per&s;on they cannot
love.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Marrying one Per&s;on, and at the
&s;ame time owning them&s;elves to be in
Love with another.</HEAD>
<P>_TO Love and not to Marry, is Na|ture's
Aver&s;ion; to Marry and not
to Love, is Nature's Corruption;
the fir&s;t is Hateful, the la&s;t is re|ally
Criminal; and, as has been
&s;aid in its Place, it is, in &s;ome Re|&s;pects,
both Murther and Robbery; it makes a
Man <HI>Felo de &s;e,</HI> with re&s;pect to all the Comforts
of his Life; and it makes him a Robber to his
Wife, if &s;he be a Woman that has the misfor|tune
to Love him. And this I have &s;poken to
at large in the la&s;t Chapter.</P>
<P>BUT to marry one Woman and love another,
to marry one Man and be in love with another,
this is yet wor&s;e, tenfold wor&s;e, if that be po&s;|&s;ible!
'tis, in its kind, a meer Piece of Witch|craft;
it is a kind of civil, legal <HI>Adultry,</HI> nay, it
makes the Man or Woman be committing Adul|tery
in their Hearts every Day of their lives;
and can I be wrong therefore to &s;ay, that it may
be very well called a Matrimonial Whoredom?
if I may judge, it is one of the wor&s;t Kinds
of it too.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="198">
IT is (fir&s;t) a plain downright Crime in the
beginning of it; if both the Man and the Wo|man
are in it, they indeed cheat one another;
fir&s;t the man thinks the Woman has the wor&s;t
of it, and that he only cheats her; &s;he fancies
he has the wor&s;t of it, and that &s;he cheats him;
but, in &s;hort, 'tis a mutual Fraud, wherein
both are Cheats and both Cheated, both Deceivers
and both Deceived.</P>
<P>WHEN they come to the Book to marry,
they mutually engage what was engaged before,
like a Knave that borrows Money upon an E&s;tate
which he had mortgaged already. Mark what
a Complication of Crimes meet together in the
Church; when they come up to the Altar,
the Man plights her his Troth or Truth, that he
will love her; when he knows he cannot do it,
for that he loves another already before her.</P>
<P>THE Woman plights him her Troth, that &s;he
will love him, when, as the Lady ju&s;t now
mentioned, told Sir <HI>Thomas</HI>&mdash;, &s;he heartily
hated him from the fir&s;t time &s;he ever &s;aw him.
Here is mutual pledging the Troth to a Fal&s;|hood,
which is, in &s;hort, a premeditated Lye;
like a cold Blood murther, 'tis intended to be
done long before it is done. Here's al&s;o a &s;tated,
calm, intended Perjury; a &s;wearing to do what
they own they not only did not intend to
do, but knew beforehand they could not
do.</P>
<P>HOW many kinds of Di&s;hone&s;ty are here
mixt together? Take it in the very fir&s;t Words
of the Mini&s;ter, being as an Introduction to the
Office of Matrimony; the Mini&s;ter adjures
them, as they will an&s;wer it at the great and
dreadful Day, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> when the Secrets of all
Hearts &s;hall be revealed, that if they know
<PB N="183" REF="199">
any lawful Hindrance or Impediment why they
&s;hould not be lawfully joyned together, they
&s;hould then declare it, prote&s;ting again&s;t even
the Validity of the Marriage, in ca&s;e they
fail.</P>
<P>I Require and charge you both, (as ye will an&s;wer
at the dreadful Day of Judgment, when the
Secrets of all Hearts &s;hall be di&s;clo&s;ed) that if
either of you know any Impediment, why ye may
not be lawfully joyned together in Matrimony, ye
do now confe&s;s it. For be ye well a&s;&s;ured, that &s;o
many as are coupled together otherwi&s;e than <HI>GOD'S</HI>
Word doth allow, are not joyned together by <HI>GOD,</HI>
neither is their Matrimony lawful.</P>
<P>HEREUPON the Mini&s;ter giving them time
to an&s;wer, they are Silent; that is to &s;ay, they
declare no Impediment, which is a tacit de|claring
that they know of none; and yet, at
the &s;ame time, they know that in Con&s;cience
they have &s;ettled their Love and Affection upon
another Per&s;on; and the Man or Woman they
now marry they cannot love, and ought not on
that Account to marry, becau&s;e they Promi&s;e
what they know they &s;hall not perform.</P>
<P>HOW many times al&s;o does the Secret come
out afterwards, either unawares by them&s;elves,
or in delirious Fits, extremities of Di&s;tempers,
Dreams, talking in the Sleep, and &s;uch other
Ways, which prove however fatal to the Peace
of the Family, yet unavoidable?</P>
<P>SUCH Per&s;ons have great Rea&s;on to be &s;ure
that they do not talk in their Sleep; for what
the Mind bears &s;uch a Weight of upon it, which
indeed it is not equal to, and is not po&s;&s;ible to be
&s;upported, thought by a vigilant guarding the
<PB N="184" REF="200">
Tongue in the Day-time it &s;hall be kept in,
yet how often will it break out in a Dream,
and the Tongue betray it &s;elf in its &s;leep?</P>
<P>HOW mi&s;erable is the Lady, frequently
wi&s;hing &s;he was in the Arms of the Man &s;he
loves in&s;read of his Arms, who the is unhap|pily
tyed to? Tho&s;e ardent Wi&s;hes prompting
her De&s;ires, &s;he falls into a Slumber, and dreams
that it is really &s;o, as &s;he wi&s;hed it might
be.</P>
<P>IN the tran&s;ports of her Imagination her
waking Soul commands her Tongue, tho' the
whole Organick Body be laid a&s;leep; I &s;ay,
commands the Tongue to tell the dangerous
Truth; &s;he cries out, as in an Exta&s;y, di&s;covers
the Affection, and unhappily names the Man:
The fair&mdash;, the Toa&s;t of the Town, the
Beauty of the Beauties, had Admirers enongh,
was beloved to Madne&s;s and Di&s;$raction by a
throng of Admirers; at la&s;t, for the &s;ake of
a Settlement, a little more than ordinary large,
&s;he quits the generous <HI>Ca</HI>&mdash;, the Lord of her
Affections, the only Man in the World that had
found the Way into her Heart, and to whom
&s;he had made innumerable Vows of Fidelity;
I &s;ay, quits him with the utmo&s;t Rudene&s;s, and
throws her &s;elf at the Importunities and Com|mands
of her avaritious Parents; I &s;ay, throws
her &s;elf into the Arms of a mean, a cour&s;e, an
unbred, half-taught Citizen, the Son of a rich
overgrown Trade&s;man him&s;elf a Clown, only
that he was a Boor of Fortune, can keep her
fine, and cau&s;e her to ride in a Coach: And
what then?</P>
<P>SHE marries this Lump of unpoli&s;hed, &s;im|ple
Stuff, and they live Tolerably well for a
Time, when one Night, in a Dream, &s;he fan|cied
<PB N="185" REF="201">
her &s;elf in the Arms of her former Lover
pleas'd to a Rapture with what &s;he had &s;o long
Rea&s;on to know &s;he could never enjoy; &s;he
flies out even in her Dream to talking aloud;
and not only to talk aloud, tho' fa&s;t a&s;leep,
but gives her Tongue a lee&s;e into all the mo&s;t
dangerous Expre&s;&s;ions, that Love to the real
Ma&s;ter of her Heart, and the utmo&s;t Contempt
of her Jaylor, as &s;he call'd him, meaning her
Husband, could in&s;pire her with: Nor was this
all; for where will Misfortunes End! but in the
highth of her Exta&s;ies and with a wicked, tho'
but fancied Liberty, &s;he calls her former
Lover by his Name, and &s;o betrays her &s;elf to
her Husband, who hears him&s;elf accu&s;ed of the
wor&s;t of Crimes, treated with the wor&s;t Con|tempt,
and the greate&s;t of Indignity put upon
him, in Words at length, that can be thought
of.</P>
<P>HER Husband was not at fir&s;t well awake,
and &s;o, perhaps, was not let into the fir&s;t Part
of it; nor was he pre&s;ently capable of under|&s;tanding
what it all meant: But when he heard
him&s;elf abu&s;ed in &s;o gro&s;s a manner, it put
him into a Pa&s;&s;ion, and he replied ra&s;hly to
her, not thinking &s;he had been a&s;leep.</P>
<P>THIS replying to her, unhappily waked
her, or, at leaft &s;o much, as to put a &s;top to
her talking aloud. Her Husband was pre&s;ently
aware that his Wife was not awake, and vexed
that he waked her; he lies &s;till a little, till Sleep
overcoming her, and the plea&s;ing Ideas of her
pa&s;t Loves &s;et her to talking again; when her
Husband &s;ubtilly managing him&s;elf, &s;poke
&s;oftly at her Ear &s;everal Words agreeal$le to
what &s;he had &s;aid, and brought her by that
means (as is not impracticable) to an&s;wer &s;e|veral
<PB N="186" REF="202">
Que&s;tions, and that in &s;uch a manner, as
his Patience would bear it no longer.</P>
<P>THIS want of Temper was perhaps her Feli|city
&s;o far, as that &s;he di&s;covered no more to
him, though &s;he had di&s;covered &s;o much already,
as made an irreconcileable Breach between
them: And fir&s;t, as he was exa&s;perated to the
highe&s;t Degree by what he had heard, and
waked her in a kind of a Pa&s;&s;ion; he asked
her, what &s;he had been dreaming of?</P>
<P>SHE was not pre&s;ently come to her &s;elf e|nough
to recollect that it was all a Dream, &s;o that
&s;he made him no An&s;wer for a while; but he
repeating the Que&s;tion, it &s;oon came into her
Thoughts, that &s;he had dreamed &s;omething not
fit to tell him of; &s;o &s;he an&s;wered, &s;he had
dreamed of nothing; but he pre&s;&s;ing her with
the Que&s;tion, &s;he &s;aid, Did &s;he Dream? why,
if &s;he did, &s;he could not remember it. But
what Confu&s;ion was &s;he in, when &s;he heard him
tell her all the particulars of her Dream, as
fairly (almo&s;t) as if &s;he had told them her &s;elf?</P>
<P>HOWEVER, &s;he in&s;i&s;ted that &s;he knew no|thing
of it; that if &s;he did dream, nothing
was more frequent than for People to dream,
and forget what they dreamt of, and &s;o might
&s;he; for that &s;he knew nothing of it, at the &s;ame
time little thinking, nay, not &s;u&s;pecting what
had happened, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that &s;he had been talking in
her Sleep to her former Lover, with all po&s;&s;ible
Endearments, and had &s;poken to him of her Hu&s;|band
with the utmo&s;t Contempt; and &s;he was
confounded again to have her Husband repeat
the very Words which &s;he knew &s;he had dreamed
of.</P>
<P>BUT her Husband, who&s;e Pa&s;&s;ion drove him
beyond all Bounds, was not &s;atisfied with up|braiding
<PB N="187" REF="203">
her with the Particulars, but told
her, that &s;he had revealed them all her &s;elf in
her Sleep, and that &s;he had &s;aid &s;o and &s;o to
him, upon his making little &s;hort An&s;wers to
her; and offering &s;ome Que&s;tions, and that, in
&s;hort, &s;he had betrayed her own Intrigues; from
whence, he charged her openly with being Di&s;|hone&s;t,
and with that Per&s;on al&s;o, and that before
her Marriage to him as well as after, alledging
that it appeared from her own Mouth. Nor
was he prudent enough to conceal the Thing,
and to let it lie as a private Feud between
them&s;elves; but he told it openly and pub|lickly
among the Neighbours, and in almo&s;t
all Company. But he had the wor&s;t of the
Quarrel, though he had the better of the Fact,
and that by his want of Conduct too.</P>
<P>THE Women's Wit, they &s;ay, never fails
them at a Pinch; 'tis ea&s;y to imagine, that his
Wife was in the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion at the di&s;co|very
of the Thing as it was, and e&s;pecially
while &s;he was at a lo&s;s to know which way he
came by his Information; for though &s;he might
ea&s;ily have &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;he mu&s;t have &s;poke
aloud in her Sleep, yet as &s;he had never known
her &s;elf to do &s;o before, &s;he did not think of it
at fir&s;t, but thought he had dealt with the De|vil,
and that he mu&s;t have been with &s;ome
Conjurer, who, as &s;he had been told, could, by
the help of the Devil, fir&s;t make People dream
of what they thought fit to inject into their
Thoughts, and then tell of it to whom they
thought fit.</P>
<P>THIS filled her with Indignation at her Hu&s;|band,
for having, as &s;he affirmed, bewitched
her, and employed the Devil to betray her into
Mi&s;chief, and then betray that Mi&s;chief; and
<PB N="188" REF="204">
&s;he re&s;olved to give him a home Charge upon
the Subject, and threaten to bring him upon
the publick Stage for Inchantment and Sor|cery.</P>
<P>BUT he put a better Invention into her Head;
for unwarily he threw it out, that he heard
her talk in her Sleep, and that he ask'd her &s;uch
and &s;uch Que&s;tions, by whi&s;pering in her Ear,
and that &s;he an&s;wered &s;o and &s;o.</P>
<P>IT immediately occurred to her, that if this
was all he had for it, he was but one Affirma|tive,
and no Witne&s;s in his own Ca&s;e, and that
her Negative might go as far as his Affirmative;
that &s;he had no more to do but to deny the Fact;
that as to the Story of whi&s;pering Que&s;tions,
and her an&s;wering them, the Pretence was a No|velty;
and &s;o &s;trange, that tho' it might be true,
no Body would believe it, e&s;pecially if &s;he
firmly denied it.</P>
<P>UPON this &s;he began with him; told him,
&s;he had perceived a good while his jealous and
unea&s;y Humour, and that he had laid a great
many Plots and De&s;igns to attack her Reputation,
and all to find an Excu&s;e to ju&s;tify his ill U&s;age
of her; but that her Conduct was &s;uch before
the whole World, that no Body would believe
him; and that now he had dre&s;s'd up a Story
between the Devil and him, to fix &s;omething
upon her, if po&s;&s;ible; but that it was an evi|dent
Forgery of his own, with the help of his
Witchcraft: And as the Story was it &s;elf impro|bable,
and next to impo&s;&s;ible, &s;o &s;he declared
it was a Lie, and &s;he defied the Devil and
him, they might both do their wor&s;t.</P>
<P>SHE gave him this &s;o Roundly, and with &s;uch
A&s;&s;urance, and told it al&s;o &s;o publickly, (as he
did his Story) that the Man began to find &s;he
<PB N="189" REF="205">
had the better of him; that People began to
think her ill u&s;ed; that he was only jealous of
her, and that he had made this Story to bla&s;t
her Character, and to ju&s;tify his own Jealou&s;ies;
then as to the whi&s;pering Story, every Body
&s;aid it looked like a Forgery indeed, and no
Body believed a Word of it, for it &s;eemed impro|bable;
&s;o that the Husband began to talk le&s;s of
the Matter than before, and was &s;en&s;ible that
&s;he was too hard for him.</P>
<P>BUT the more he began to give out, the
more furiou&s;ly &s;he followed her Blow; for &s;he
not only told her Tale, as above, but &s;he em|ployed
two or three Emi&s;&s;aries to hand it about
among the Ladies at the Tea Table, and a|mong
the Go&s;&s;ips; and the Man, in a word,
got &s;uch an ill Name, that he was the Contempt
of all his Neighbours.</P>
<P>NOR did &s;he End here; but &s;he added her
former De&s;ign to the latter: And, fir&s;t, &s;he &s;e|parated
from him at home, or, as 'tis u&s;ually
expre&s;s'd, they parted Beds; in &s;hort, &s;he told
him, that it was reported there were Magicians
and Fellows that dealt with the <HI>Devil,</HI> who,
they &s;aid, by the help of Evil Spirits, could
cau&s;e People to dream what and when they
plea&s;ed, and to talk in their Sheep, and that
&s;he under&s;tood her Husband had been conver&s;ing
with &s;ome of tho&s;e cunning Men, as they call'd
them, in order to make the Experiment upon
her, by whi&s;pering Things in her Ear while
&s;he was a&s;leep, and &s;o making her Dream &s;o and
&s;o, and then report, that &s;he talked of tho&s;e
Things in her &s;leep, in order to expo&s;e her.</P>
<P>THAT therefore &s;he would lie by her &s;elf,
for &s;he would not lie in Bed with one that
would bring the Devil into the Room, to ex|po&s;e
<PB N="190" REF="206">
and betray her; that &s;he would have her
Maid lie with her every Night, that &s;he might
have good Witne&s;s of her Conduct; but that
&s;he would not tru&s;t her &s;elf any more to &s;leep
with one that would betray her to the Devil,
and then to all the World.</P>
<P>THIS &s;he not only told her Husband, but
told it to all her Friends and Tea Table Emi&s;|&s;aries;
and the Story was &s;o plau&s;ible in its
kind, and was told &s;o much to her Advantage,
that every Body ju&s;tify'd her Conduct, &s;aid
&s;he was in the right, that &s;he could do no le&s;s,
and that no Woman in her Sen&s;es would &s;leep
in Bed with a Man who was able to do &s;uch
Things as tho&s;e; and that, in &s;hort, it was all
one as to &s;leep with the Devil.</P>
<P>THE Man had no Remedy but to deny the
Charge, and to &s;ay he never had any thing to
do with the Devil, or with any &s;uch People as
Conjurers, Magicians, or any &s;uch Sort of
Folks, in his life. But all that went but a little
Way, for who would not deny it if they were
the mo&s;t guilty of any in the World; but the
Woman vouched that &s;o and &s;o he had &s;aid, and
&s;uch and &s;uch Things he had pretended; that
he could not do &s;o without the help of the Devil;
and that therefore it was not &s;afe for her, by
any means, to tru&s;t her &s;elf with him.</P>
<P>THUS the guilty Wife got the Victory over
the innocent Husband, by the meer dexterity of
her Wit, and the Conduct of her Allies, not
forgetting the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Publick Clamour;
the Man him&s;elf, at the &s;ame time, was not
famed for overmuch Sen&s;e or Conduct in this,
or other Things, and therefore was the ea&s;ier
managed by a keen witted Wife. But the Infe|rence
from the whole Di&s;cour&s;e comesin perfectly
<PB N="191" REF="207">
adapted to the Argument which it $is brought
to confirm, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that to love one Per&s;on, be
it Man or Woman, and then marry another, is
neither hone&s;t to the Per&s;on quitted, or to the
Per&s;on married, but e&s;pecially not to the la&s;t,
and more e&s;pecially not hone&s;t to the Per&s;on
her&s;elf or him&s;elf; in a word, it is not an ho|ne&s;t
Marriage; for the engaged Affection is a
ju&s;t Impediment, and ought to have been de|clared
and di&s;covered at the Book, upon the De|claration
appointed to be made by the Mini&s;ter,
as above, or before they came &s;o far.</P>
<P>AS for the Succe&s;s of &s;uch Marriages, the
Ble&s;&s;ing attending them, and what Happine&s;s
is to be expected from them, it &s;eems to be laid
open in Part, in the little Hi&s;tory ju&s;t recited;
but 'tis really vi&s;ible to common Experience in
almo&s;t every Age and Place in the World, I
mean our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> World.</P>
<P>WHAT Delight, what Complai&s;ance can
there be in that Matrimony, where the Heart
did not go with the Hand? where the Marriage
may be &s;aid to be made from the Teeth out|ward,
and no more? where the Love is fixed in
one Place, and the Bed made in another? What
is this but a fraudulent Contract, a Prote&s;ta|tion,
with a de&s;ign to deceive, which, by the
Way, is the very E&s;&s;ence of a LYE, and one of
the wor&s;t Kind too?</P>
<P>WHAT Complai&s;ance or Plea&s;ure in their
Enjoyments of any kind, between the unhappy
Couple, and how can it be called a fair Mar|riage?
Two &s;wear to love, and at the &s;ame time

Circum&s;tances enter into a horrid Slavery; the
Woman dragged by her old Grandmother, or
her thundering and threatning Parent, becau&s;e
the Mi&s;er can give her a Portion, or not give
it her, as he plea&s;es; can make her a Fortune or
a Chamber-maid, a Lady or a Shoemaker's
Wife. Under the&s;e Terrors and Obligations,
&s;he does as &s;he's bid, and marries any Body
they plea&s;e, let him have Wit, Sen&s;e and Man|ners,
or neither Wit, Sen&s;e or Manners: As &s;he
is pre-engaged, and her Affections look quite
another Way, the thoughts of this Marriage
are her Abhorrence, her Aver&s;ion, and yet &s;he
marries him. What mu&s;t we call this? Is it
Matrimony? No, no; it has nothing of Matri|mony
in it but the Form; 'tis all a Cheat;
they lie to one another when they repeat the
Words; and they both know they do &s;o, nay, they
intend to do &s;o; as to the Con&s;equence, you have
it before, between Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> and my Lady
&mdash;But as to the Fact, 'tis horrid in its
Nature; they are but two Victims, I cannot
indeed, in one Sen&s;e, call them Pro&s;titutes;
but they are pro&s;tituted by the governing Re|lations,
brought together by the arbitrary Au|thority
of tho&s;e that have the Influence over
them: Here, &s;ays the old Father with a lordly
Air to his Son, take this young Woman to
Church, and marry her; perhaps the Debate
has been between them before about loving her
or not loving her, and the young Man has
told him po&s;itively, he hates her, or that he
can't love her. But 'tis all one, the old Man
likes the Settlement, and tells him in &s;o many
Words, that if he won't take her, his Brother
&s;hall, and &s;hall have his E&s;tate too.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="209">
I could name &s;o many Examples of this kind,
and give you an Account of &s;o many Families
ruined by it, that it would tire you in the
reading. But give me leave to &s;ingle out one
for your Remark, which, though the Ca&s;e was
nearer home, you mu&s;t allow me to place at
&s;ome Di&s;tance, that the particular Families
may not be marked out and expo&s;ed. Suppo&s;e
then the Scene in <HI>France,</HI> not far from a great
City, not the greate&s;t but the greate&s;t City but
one in the Kingdom: A certain rich Merchant
had two Sons, and though he had a very great
E&s;tate, it was of his own Purcha&s;ing, &s;o that
there was no Entail upon it, and he was there|fore
at liberty to give it to which of his Sons he
plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>HIS elde&s;t Son was a young Gentleman of
good Sen&s;e, and a very agreeable Per&s;on, and
his Father had be&s;towed &s;ome Charge upon his
Education, had given him learning and good
Breeding, to qualify him, as he &s;aid, for the
Life of a Gentleman, and, as he u&s;ually ex|pre&s;&s;ed
it, to make him know how to live agree|able
to the Fortune he was able to give him;
but withal, the Father kept him pretty much
in Subjection; and the more, by making him
always &s;en&s;ible how much it was in his Power
to make him a Gentleman or a Beggar, that is
to &s;ay, to give him an E&s;tate, and make him
live like a Gentleman, or turn him loo&s;e in
the World to &s;eek his Fortune.</P>
<P>PARTICULARLY, the Father was often re|peating
to his Son, how he expected that he
&s;hould conform him&s;elf to his Meaures in tak|ing
a Wife, and that if he did not, he would ab|&s;olutely
di&s;inherit him, and give his E&s;tate to
his younger Brother.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="210">
WHETHER this ab&s;olute Declaration of the
Father, did not, in &s;ome manner, influence the
Son, &s;o as to create, with the aver&s;ion to the
Tyranny of it, a kind of di&s;like to every thing
the Father could propo&s;e, I cannot &s;ay; per|haps
there might be &s;omething of that kind in
it too, for Nature abhors Violence in Love.</P>
<P>BUT however it was, this is certain, that
when his Father propo&s;ed a Match to him, he
did it with an Air of Authority; told him, he
had pitched upon &s;uch a Family, where he
knew there was a &s;uitable Fortune; that it was
a very advantagious Alliance, and that he had
already di&s;cour&s;ed with the Lady's Father, and
he found Things were very well, and that
every Thing would be to his mind, and
therefore he would have him think of marrying
her.</P>
<P>BUT, Sir, <HI>&s;ays the Son,</HI> you will plea&s;e to let
me &s;ee the Lady, I hope.</P>
<P>WHY, &s;ays the <HI>Father,</HI> what if you &s;hould

<P>Nay, Sir, I cannot tell what to &s;ay; if

<P>UPON this, the young Man yielded, and the
Contracts being fini&s;hed, they were married by
Proxy, as great Men are; but the Con&s;equence
was, that he went to another Lady whom he
loved, and had been in love with for &s;ome
Years, and letting her know the Di&s;tre&s;s he was
in, they con&s;ulted together what to do; and
the re&s;ult was this, they went together, and
were privately married, and the Marriage fairly
con&s;ummated, at lea&s;t a Month before the other,
and confirmed by good and &s;ub&s;tantial Wit|ne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>BUT concealing it entirely from his Father,
he wickedly went and married the other Lady
too, in publick; by which indeed, he obtained
an irrever&s;ible Settlement of his Father's E&s;tate;
&s;o that when it came to a di&s;overy, his Father
could not take it away again, or di&s;inherit
him, the E&s;tate being fully and fairly &s;et|tled.</P>
<P>THE Lady was indeed gro&s;ly injured and
abu&s;ed, for though &s;he was fairly married, yet
he was not; and upon a long, and to him,
&s;hameful Hearing, in a Court of Ju&s;tice, the
fir&s;t Woman was declared his lawful Wife, only
the other being left to take her Remedy again&s;t
him at Law, which yet &s;he would not do.</P>
<P>BUT the Con&s;equence did not End here; for
the Gentleman carried it &s;o obligingly to her
who he had not loved, and managed &s;o dex|trou&s;ly,
with her who he had both loved and
married, that he brought them to con&s;ent to
Poligamy, and they both lived with him, and
<PB N="197" REF="213">
that in one Hou&s;e too; he kept them indeed
&s;eparate Apartments, and different Servants,
but they carried it very well to one another,
and lived ea&s;y, there being a plentiful Fortune
among them.</P>
<P>BUT even in this be&s;t Side of the Story,
what a Complication of Mi&s;chie&s;s was here?
Here was Matrimonial Whoredom in the very
Letter of it, and all introduced by a force upon
Affection, (1.) By the Father unju&s;tly forcing
his Son to marry a Woman he did not love. (2.)
By the Son wickedly cheating his Father in a
&s;eeming &s;candalous Compliance to get the
E&s;tate. (3.) By the Son again, ba&s;ely and injuri|ou&s;ly
marrying a virtuous Lady, impo&s;ing him|&s;elf
upon her as a &s;ingle Man, when he was
already married to another Woman. And, la&s;tly,
by living in open Adultery, and keeping them
both.</P>
<P>I could, as I have &s;aid, load you with Sto|ries
of this kind, I mean, of the forcing young
People to marry again&s;t Inclination, and con|trary
to &s;ecret Obligation, and e&s;pecially con|trary
to pre-ingaged Affections: But I mu&s;t
give you this Ob&s;ervation upon them, which,
in effect, is equal to the repeating them, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
that they would be almo&s;t every one of them
tragical; e&s;pecially if you will allow to have
the de&s;troying all the Comforts of Life, and all
the Enjoyment that could be expected in the
State of Marriage, be reckoned tragical; which
indeed I do allow, and every whit as tragical as
cutting of Throats.</P>
<P>TO cro&s;s the Affections of young People
in Marriage, e&s;pecially where the propo&s;ed
Object is not &s;candalous or extreamly de|&s;picable,
is, I think, a little &s;ynonimous to
<PB N="198" REF="214">
Murther; it is a wilful Violence upon the
Mind, and that, I think, equal or &s;uperior to a
Violence upon the Body; it is a formal Ra|vi&s;hment
upon Virtue, and that in &s;o much
the wor&s;e a manner, as it is done under the
Form of Ju&s;tice and Law, and is &s;till made
wor&s;e, in that it is without a Remedy.</P>
<P>IF Violence is offered to the Cha&s;tity of a
Woman, &s;he has her recour&s;e to the Law, and
&s;he will be redre&s;s'd as far as redre&s;s can be ob|tained.
Where the Fact is irretrievable, the
Man &s;hould be puni&s;hed, and the Woman is
protected by the Law from any farther Force
upon her for the future. But here the Woman
is put to Bed to the Man by a kind of forced
Authority of Friends; 'tis a Rape upon the
Mind; her Soul, her brighte&s;t Faculties, her
Will, her Affections are ravi&s;hed, and &s;he is
left without redre&s;s, &s;he is left in the Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the Ravi&s;her, or of him, who, by
their Order, &s;he was delivered up to, and &s;he
is bound in the Chains of the &s;ame Violence for
her whole life.</P>
<P>HORRID abu&s;e! Here is a &s;acred In&s;titution
violated, and, as I may &s;ay, prophaned; an un|ju&s;t
Violence offered to Cha&s;tity and Mode&s;ty
on one hand, and to Hone&s;ty on the other;
who marries by the importuning Authority of
the Parent, contrary to &s;olemn and &s;ecret En|gagements
pa&s;s'd to another, contrary to Incli|nation,
and contrary to pre-ingaged Affections,
and, at la&s;t, contrary to Law.</P>
<P>IS not here a Matrimonial Whoredom? I
think, if it allows any alteration in the Word,
it is for the wor&s;e, and it &s;hould rather be called
a Matrimonial Adultery. Nor is it very unu|&s;ual
for the&s;e Sorts of Matches to be pleaded as
<PB N="199" REF="215">
Excu&s;es for all the wicked Excur&s;ions which are
made after Marriage, either by one Side or
other: The Man hangs about the Woman he
loved before, follows her even after he is mar|ried
to another; tells her, &s;he is the <HI>Wife of his
Affection,</HI> the other is only his <HI>Wife in Law,</HI> and
by Form; that he &s;till faithful, and has re|&s;erved
his Heart for her, though he has given
his Hand to the other, who he is cruelly bound
to call Wife.</P>
<P>IT is not long &s;ince we had a publick Ex|ample
of this, and that in the highe&s;t Cla&s;s of
Dignity, and where the Lady in&s;i&s;ted upon her
being as lawful a Wife, and as &s;trictly Virtuous
as the fairly and openly married Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; and
even in the very Article of Death, re&s;u&s;ed to
acknowledge it a Crime. But I would not, I
&s;ay, bring Examples too near home, where they
are publickly known, nor revive the Mi&s;takes,
which &s;hould rather be buried in the Grave
with the Per&s;ons mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>FORCING to marry, is, in the plain Con&s;e|quences,
not only a forcing to Crime, but fur|ni&s;hing
an Excu&s;e to Crime; I do not &s;ay, 'tis
a ju&s;t Excu&s;e, for nothing can be a ju&s;t Excu&s;e
for an unju&s;t Action; but 'tis furni&s;hing a
plau&s;ible Pretence, to &s;uch Per&s;ons e&s;pecially,
who were but indifferently furni&s;hed with Vir|tue
before, to ju&s;tify the Excur&s;ions of their
Vice: Now as a Man who is forced by any undue
Re&s;traint to enter into Obligations of Debt,
give Bonds, Judgments, and &s;uch like Acknow|ledgments,
meerly to obtain his Liberty, &s;hall
plead that Force in Bar of any Pro&s;ecution up|on
tho&s;e Obligations; and the Law will allow
the Plea, e&s;pecially where the Debt al&s;o is
ju&s;t; &s;o the&s;e Men plead the Breach made up|on
<PB N="200" REF="216">
their Inclinations to ju&s;tify the Breaches
they make upon the lawful Re&s;traints both of
Human or Divine Laws, but with not the like
Ju&s;tice in the Plca.</P>
<P>IT was a very unhappy Dialogue between a
young Gentleman, and a neighbouring Clergy|man,
which I lately came to the knowledge of
upon this very Subject, and which being much
to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e as my pre&s;ent Argument
points out, may not be improper here.</P>
<P>THE young Gentleman had been dragged into
&s;uch a Marriage, <HI>as I have ju&s;t now mentioned,</HI> by
the po&s;itive Command and Authority of a <HI>rich
Uncle,</HI> who had a great E&s;tate to give, and who
had fixed upon his Nephew as his next Heir,
being his Brother's only Son; it &s;eems this
Uncle had declared, he would make the young
Man his Heir, if he married to his Mind.</P>
<P>THE young Gentleman was too wi&s;e not to
oblige his Uncle in every thing he could; but
in this of Love he was very unkindly cro&s;s'd
by the old Man, and indeed very unju&s;tly too.
The Ca&s;e, as I received the Account, was as
follows:</P>
<P>THERE was a young Lady in the Neighbour|hood,
who the old Man had propo&s;ed to this
Nephew to marry; and her F&s;iends being con|tent
to treat about it, the Terms of E&s;tate and
Settlements were agreed between them, and the
Writings were ordered to be drawn; for that
Lady had no incon&s;iderable Fortune neither;
in the mean time, the Gentleman was admitted
to wait upon the young Lady, (and, which does
not often fall out indeed, where the Choice is
made fir&s;t by Grandfathers and Uncles, as was
the Ca&s;e here) they agreed; liked one anothe&s;
mighty well, and it went on even to loving one
<PB N="201" REF="217">
another, and that violently. In the mean time
&s;omething pre&s;ented it &s;elf with more Fortune,
and the Uncle takes upon him to change his
Mind, impo&s;ing the change too upon his Ne|phew,
and &s;o breaks off the Match; obliging
him to go and wait upon a new Mi&s;tre&s;s, and
this without &s;o much as a Pretence of any other
Objection, than that of a larger Portion offer|ing
in another. The young Gentleman was
exceedingly di&s;gu&s;ted at the Propo&s;al, and u&s;ed
all po&s;&s;ible Arguments with his Uncle, and em|ployed
all his Friends to per&s;uade him to let
the fir&s;t Match go forward, as it had been car|ried
on &s;uch a length, that he could not go off
with Honour or Satisfaction to him&s;elf, the
young Lady and he being mutually engaged in
Affections as well as Intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>BUT the old Man was inflexible and arbi|trary,
would not hear of any Rea&s;ons, but
would be obeyed; and as for Affections, and
&s;uch trifles as the&s;e, he &s;lighted them to the la&s;t
Degree, as things of no Con&s;equence at all in
the Ca&s;e: Well, the young Gentleman had no
Remedy; he was obliged, though with infinite
Reluctance, to abandon his Mi&s;tre&s;s, a Lady of
Merit and Beauty, Fortune and good Breed|ing,
and every thing agreeable to him; and
turn his Eyes where his Uncle directed, with|out
any regard to all the&s;e, or to his own Incli|nation.
But he did not do this without ac|quainting
the Lady with the Force that was
put upon him, and letting her know his un|happy
Circum&s;tances; offering to relinqui&s;h
all the hopes of his Uncle's Fortune and Fa|vour,
and take her at all Hazards. But. her
Friends would not agree to that; nor would
&s;he con&s;ent without her Father, for then they
<PB N="202" REF="218">
might have been both Beggars. This being the
Ca&s;e, they parted, but with mutual A&s;&s;urances
however of Affection, and of a farther Union,
if the Uncle could be brought to any com|pliance.</P>
<P>BUT this was not all, for now the Uncle
propo&s;es the new Match to him, and &s;ends him
to wait upon the Lady. He had, with great
difficulty, complied with the old Gentleman in
the quitting the fir&s;t Lady, who was Mi&s;tre&s;s
of a thou&s;and good Qualities, as well as of a
good Fortune. But when he came to this new
propo&s;ed Creature, his Stomach turned at the
very Sight of her: She was not deformed in|deed,
but far from hand&s;ome; &s;he had neither
Wit or Manners, good Humour or good Breed|ing,
beauty of Body or beauty of Mind; in a
word, &s;he was every way di&s;agreeable, only that
&s;he had a va&s;t Fortune.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, the Uncle, that was as Arbi|trary
in the <HI>Negative</HI> before, was as Tyrannick
in the <HI>Affirmative</HI> now; and without troubling
you with the many Di&s;putes between the Un|cle
and the Nephew upon that Head; his En|treaties,
his humble Petitions again&s;t the
Match, declaring (as he him&s;elf &s;aid) to his
Uncle, that he had much rather be hang'd; yet
he obliged him to take her, and take her he did,
being loth to lo&s;e an E&s;tate of near Two thou|&s;and
Pounds a Year, be&s;ides Money, and, which
was wor&s;e, having no other Dependence in the
World.</P>
<P>AFTER he was married, that is to &s;ay, cou|pled,
for he often declared 'twas no lawful Mar|riage,
but a Violence upon him; he made as
bad a Husband as any woman that knows &s;he
has nothing to be beloved for, and knows the
<PB N="203" REF="219">
Man hates her when he takes her, could ex|pect:
For being thus tyed to the four Apple
Tree, married to his Aver&s;ion, and &s;eparated
from the Object of his Affection, he abandoned
him&s;elf to Company, to Wine, to Play, and at
la&s;t to Women, and all kinds of Exce&s;s.</P>
<P>A Pious and Reverend Mini&s;ter, not of his
Pari&s;h, but of a neighbouring Pari&s;h, and of
which the Gentleman was Patron, frequently
took Opportunities to talk &s;eriou&s;ly to him
upon the &s;ad Subject of his extravagant Life,
and with a Chri&s;tian plainne&s;s; tho' with decency
and re&s;pect too, e&s;pecially as he was his Patron,
he often pre&s;s'd him to take up, to reform, and,
at le&s;t, to regulate his Morals.</P>
<P>THE Gentleman took all his Admonitions
in good Part; but told him in &s;o many
Words, 'twas his Uncle had ruined him, Soul
and Body; that he had a &s;ober Education, and
was as promi&s;ing a young Fellow as any in the
Country, till his Uncle ruined him, by forcing
him to marry again&s;t his Will; Forcing him
to abandon a Lady that he loved, and who&s;e
very Example added to the Influence &s;he would
have had upon his Affections, was enough to
have kept him within Bounds all his Days; and
then he related all the Circum&s;tances of his
Match, as I have related them above.</P>
<P>IN vain the good Mini&s;ter urged the Chri|&s;tian
Arguments of Duty, the Command of
GOD, the Scandal to his Per&s;on, the Ruin of
his Fortunes, and all the other Arguments
which Religion and Rea&s;on furni&s;h &s;o fully on
&s;uch Occa&s;ions. His An&s;wer was, What can I
do; I have no Retreat, my Family is a <HI>Bedlam;</HI>
I have no Body there to receive me but a She|Devil,
always raving, and always quarrelling;
<PB N="204" REF="220">
that is neither quiet with Ma&s;ter or Servants,
or even with her &s;elf; that has not one good
Feature to render her agreeable, or one good
Humour to render her tolerable? To be at
home, &s;ays he, is odious to me, but to dwell
there is intolerable; the Family is to me an
Ho&s;pital to look into, but would be a Jayl to
be confined to. Had I married the Woman I
loved, &s;aid he, I had been as &s;ober as I had
been happy.</P>
<P>BUT, Sir, &s;ays the <HI>good Man,</HI> Religion is
not to depend upon relative Circum&s;tances, and
we are not to &s;erve GOD, as we have, or have
not a comfortable Family.</P>
<P>THAT'S true, <HI>&s;ays the Gentleman.</HI> But who
can be religious in Hell? Who can think of
GOD, or any thing that is good, when he is
bound to Conver&s;e with every thing that's
bad?</P>
<P>SUCH things are very afflicting indeed, <HI>&s;ays
the grave Divine;</HI> but Afflictions &s;hould rather

Wife will lead a Man to Heaven.</P>
<P>AND I &s;peak of it in earne&s;t, <HI>&s;ays the Gentle|man,</HI>
that mine will drive me to the Devil.</P>
<P>O, Sir, <HI>&s;ays the Mini&s;ter, being greatly troubled
to hear him talk at that rate,</HI> do not &s;ay &s;o, I be|&s;eech
you; you ought rather to con&s;ider it as
an Affliction, and humble your Mind under it.
But running out into Crime is heaping up Mi|&s;ery,
and making bad wor&s;e.</P>
<P>WHY, what can I do, Sir? <HI>&s;ays he.</HI> Who can
tye him&s;elf down to his mortal Aver&s;ion?</P>
<P>THERE are many Chri&s;tian Methods, <HI>&s;ays the
Mini&s;ter,</HI> which you may apply your &s;elf to,
<PB N="205" REF="221">
Sir, to make the Burthen lighter to you than it

<P>WHAT are they, <HI>&s;ays the Gentleman;</HI> I don't
&s;ee into it; 'tis impo&s;hble to help me, unle&s;s
&s;ome Miracle would intervene to deliver
me.</P>
<P>YES, yes, <HI>&s;ays the heavenly Coun&s;ellor,</HI> there
are Ways: Pray to GOD, as you do at Church
for your Enemies, that he would turn her
Heart.</P>
<P>TURN her! &s;ays the Gentlemen. Pray to
GOD to give me Courage to turn her out of
Doors, and take in that ble&s;&s;ed Creature I
lov'd.</P>
<P>THAT can't be now, Sir, <HI>&s;aid the Mini&s;ter,</HI>

<P>WHY then, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> laughing, &s;hall I pray to
GOD to &s;end the Devil for her.</P>
<P>THE good Man could hardly forbear &s;mil|ing
at the Expre&s;&s;ion, but recovered him|&s;elf,
and &s;aid, Your &s;mile tells me, Sir, you are

I &s;hould an&s;wer that Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>I know not what to &s;ay, it's half in Je&s;t,

cry for her.</P>
<P>SIR, &s;ays the <HI>Mini&s;ter,</HI> I beg of you let us

to pray for our wor&s;t Enemies.</P>
<P>NAY, &s;he's my wor&s;t Enemy, that's true,
<HI>&s;ays he;</HI> but I can't promi&s;e to pray for her, and
I'm &s;ure I can never forgive her.</P>
<P>WHY &s;o, Sir, <HI>&s;ays the Divine,</HI> you are &s;trictly
commanded to forgive.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="222">
BUT not to forgive her, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> becau&s;e &s;he

him.</P>
<P>BUT, Sir, <HI>&s;ays the Divine,</HI> you mi&s;take the

upon the Penalty of not being forgiven, and
in the Command the Condition of his Repent|ance
is not included.</P>
<P>I don't know, <HI>&s;ays the Gentleman,</HI> your Doc|trine
may be good, but I can't promi&s;e that I

Nature to bear the Weight; it is un&s;uffer|able.</P>
<P>BUT, Sir, <HI>&s;ays the Mini&s;ter,</HI> there is no need
to run out to Exce&s;&s;es and Immoralities, becau&s;e
of a di&s;agreeable Wife.</P>
<P>SIR, &s;ays the <HI>Gentleman,</HI> there's need to go
abroad, when a Man can't &s;tay at home.</P>
<P>I beg, Sir, <HI>&s;ays the good Reprover,</HI> you'll con|&s;ider
whether reforming your &s;elf would not re|form
your Wife.</P>
<P>I don't know as to that, <HI>&s;ays the Gentleman;</HI>

little more quiet, but not at all more happy.</P>
<P>HOW do you mean? Sir, <HI>&s;ays the Mini&s;ter,</HI> I
don't under&s;tand that.</P>
<P>WHY, what &s;ignifies reforming her, <HI>&s;ays the

as a Nun, and as holy as an Angel, it would be
the &s;ame thing; &s;he is my Aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>NOW you have di&s;covered the Matter, <HI>&s;ays

<P>No, Sir, but to make you love your Wife;

<P>YOU don't love her, <HI>&s;ays the Mini&s;ter,</HI> that's
the greate&s;t Misforuune of it all.</P>
<P>NO, no, that's true, I don't love her to be

it may Ruin you for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="224">
NAY, Sir, <HI>&s;ays the Gentleman,</HI> I have repent|ed

<P>WHY then, <HI>&s;ays the Mini&s;ter,</HI> you have ru|ined

<P>NO, no, Sir, <HI>replies he,</HI> 'twas my Uncle
ruined me; he knows it by this time; he mur|thered
me; he &s;uffers for it, I doubt not, be|fore
now. I am undone indeed, but I had no
hand in it my &s;elf.</P>
<P>BUT, Sir, <HI>&s;ays the Mini&s;ter,</HI> be plea&s;ed to
con&s;ider the manner of Life you lead now.
The&s;e Things are &s;ad, and I lament your Con|dition

for a bad Life.</P>
<P>I tell you, <HI>&s;ays the Gentleman,</HI> there's no liv|ing
a good Life with her, &s;o I &s;hould be damn'd
if I &s;tayed at home; for I mu&s;t be always fight|ing

at home with the Devil?</P>
<P>BUT, Sir, <HI>&s;ays the Mini&s;ter,</HI> even living a|broad,
as you call it, you need not live an irn|moral

<P>WHAT,

you mean, I &s;uppo&s;e that's all.</P>

<P>WHY as to that, <HI>&s;ays the Gentleman,</HI> my Uncle

<P><PB N="209" REF="225">
I don't under&s;tand how that can be, Sir, <HI>&s;ays
the good Mini&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>WHY, 'twas all Adultery; the very Mar|riage
was but a civil Whoring; 'twas all Adul|tery
from the beginning; I was a married Man
before.</P>
<P>AY, Sir, <HI>&s;ays the Mini&s;ter,</HI> there mu&s;t be
more in that then by a great deal than ever I
under&s;tood before.</P>
<P>NO, nothing more than you knew too; I
&s;ay, 'twas a Civil Adultery, a Matrimonial
Whoredom, to marry this Woman; for I be|longed
to another Woman, our Souls were mar|ried;
we were united by the &s;tricte&s;t Bonds of
Faith and Honour; 'twas all breaking into the
Rules of Ju&s;tice, and the &s;tricte&s;t Obligations
that it was po&s;&s;ible to lay upon one another;
'twas all Perjury and Adultery of the wor&s;t
Sort. That old Wretch, my Uncle, made me
an Adulterer, and 'tis but the &s;ame Sin conti|nued
in.</P>
<P>YOU really fright me, Sir, <HI>&s;ays the mini&s;ter</HI>
Why, this is a terrible Ca&s;e: How could your
Uncle force you? And why did not you declare
at the Book, as you ought to have done, that
you knew a lawful Impediment why you
&s;hould not be joined together, for that you were
firmly engaged to another, and the other to
you; I dare &s;ay no Divine of our Church would
have married you.</P>
<P>O, Sir, there was a Rea&s;on for that too, <HI>&s;ays
the Gentleman,</HI> a Rea&s;on that no Body could
with&s;tand; a Rea&s;on enforced with an E&s;tate of
two thou&s;and Pounds a Year; and the Rea&s;on
all in the Power of a Tyrant, deaf to all Rea|&s;onings
but that of Money; in &s;hort, there's
the Rea&s;on that has undone me, and that made
<PB N="210" REF="226">
an Adulterer of me. What &s;ignifies it what I do
now?</P>
<P>'TIS a di&s;mal Ca&s;e, Sir, <HI>&s;ays the Mini&s;ter;</HI>
but I be&s;eech you to con&s;ider the Crime is not
to be continued in and encrea&s;ed; and if you
&s;inned in Marrying, you have the le&s;s need to
&s;in after Marriage. All evil Cour&s;es are to be
repented of, and broken off.</P>
<P>HERE the Mini&s;ter, went on &s;erious, like
him&s;elf, and made very earne&s;t Applications to
him to change his Cour&s;e of Life. But as that
Part is remote from our pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, I omit
the repetition. Thus far is &s;uited to the Ca&s;e
before me, <HI>namely,</HI> the mi&s;erable Con&s;equences of
Marriages entered into contrary to pre-ingaged
Affections; forced Matches made by Rela|tions,
for the meer &s;ake of Money, without re|gard
to the Obligations that may be &s;ub&s;i&s;ting
at the &s;ame time, and without regard to the
Affection and Inclination of the Parties con|cerned.
Who can call &s;uch Matches lawful
Marriages? And what is the &s;ubmitting to
them le&s;s than a Matrimonial Whoredom?</P>
<P>AS to the Matrimony that pa&s;&s;es among
Princes, Kings, Emperors, and &s;uch like, as I
&s;aid at fir&s;t, they &s;eem to me to be rather Alli|ances
and Political Agreements than Marri|ages,
in which the Conjugal Affection is not
con&s;idered as a material, or not as the mo&s;t ma|terial
Part. The Love of Princes is managed
in a higher and &s;uperior Way; it &s;eems to be
a Con&s;equence of that Marriage, not a Cau&s;e or
Rea&s;on of it; and, for ought I know, as it is not
often &s;o extraordinary as in private Per&s;ons, &s;o
it is not &s;o very often quite wanting; the Dig|nity
and Quality of the Per&s;on has a great In|fluence
upon their Behaviour, and, if they re|ally
<PB N="211" REF="227">
have not abundance of Love, they often
carry it as if they had an Exce&s;s of good Hu|mour
and Complai&s;ance, which makes up a &s;ome|thing
almo&s;t equivalent to Love; and they are
not &s;o mi&s;erable in the deficiency as meaner
People are.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, they have their Unhappine&s;&s;es
too, and as they are not without their Unea&s;i|ne&s;&s;es,
when the want of a mutual Affection
breaks out, and gets the ma&s;tery of their Civi|lities;
&s;o, on the other hand, where an entire
agreeing Affection meets in Per&s;ons of that
high Rank, how &s;uperior is their Felicity to
that of other People! How glorious is their
Peace! How beautiful the conjugal Figure!
HOW happy is the Life of &s;uch a Pair! So
great an Addition is a mutual Affection to the
happine&s;s of Life, even in Per&s;ons of the
highe&s;t Rank; it adds a Lu&s;tre to their Glory,
and is, notwith&s;tanding all other good Circum|&s;tances,
the brighte&s;t Beam in all their illu&s;tri|ous
Enjoyments. Such was the Life of two
glorious Si&s;ters, the late Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and
Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> of whom it is &s;aid, and I never
heard it contradicted, that they were entire
Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of their Royal Con&s;orts Affections,
Queens of their Hearts, enjoyed a compleat
conjugal Felicity, and furni&s;hed back the &s;ame
Joy, making full Returns in kind. Nor is it
the lea&s;t Part of their Fame. But then it may
be added to both tho&s;e happy Couples, and
which yet confirms what I am arguing upon,
that they &s;aw and loved before they married.
They neither courted by Pictures, or married by
Proxy; their Princes came over hither to view,
chu&s;e, and approve, and then married the Per|&s;ons
they cho&s;e; they courted in Per&s;on, and &s;o,
<PB N="212" REF="228">
I think, all &s;hould do that expect to enjoy in
Per&s;on.</P>
<P>How happy is it, and how good has Provi|dence
been, in directing human Affairs, that
Matrimonial Love is a common Ble&s;&s;ing! that
the mo&s;t perfect Enjoyment, and that which
alone compleats all Enjoyments, and fini&s;hes the
Happine&s;s of Life, is an Enclo&s;ure laid open
by the merciful Di&s;po&s;ition of Heaven, for all
his Creatures to &s;hare of; and the meane&s;t ho|ne&s;t
Man, who is not pre&s;s'd with Poverty, is
oftentimes as compleatly happy, and always as
capable of being &s;o, as the greate&s;t Prince, I
mean, as to his conjugal Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>SUITABLE Society is a heavenly Life. Take
a view of Family Di&s;orders; Hou&s;hold Strife
and Contention, and join but to the&s;e the Ma|trimonial
Vices I &s;peak of, and you make the
Hou&s;e a Hell, where Rage and Crime con&s;titute
the Place, and where the Flame burns without
con&s;uming, though not without encrea&s;ing; and
where the Offences encrea&s;e the Puni&s;hment,
and the Puni&s;hment encrea&s;es the Offence. But
we mu&s;t proceed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of unequal, un&s;uitable, and prepo&s;terous
MARRIAGES, and the unhappy Con&s;e|quences
of them. Of the Effects they
have upon the Family conver&s;ation.
How they occa&s;ion a Matrimonial Whore|dom
many Ways. Al&s;o &s;omething of
the Marriage Covenant and Oath; and
how all the Breaches of it are a Poli|tical
and Matrimonial Whoredom, if
not a Literal Whoredom; with &s;everal
Examples.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Contract between a Man and
Woman, which we call the Mar|riage
Covenant, is mutual and re|ciprocal,
the Obligations on either
Side are equal, and the Weight
they carry with them is equally
obligatory. What Inequalities there are in the
coming together, ought to be con&s;idered be|fore-hand;
and the want of con&s;idering tho&s;e
Inequalities before-hand, is that of which I
complain: The&s;e Inequalities, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure,
<PB N="214" REF="230">
de&s;troy the End of Matrimony; and if
they do not make it void, yet they rob the Par|ties
of the &s;ocial Comfort of a married Life;
and &s;ome indeed entirely de&s;troy tho&s;e Comforts
them&s;elves.</P>
<P>IF any Man &s;hall tell me, tho&s;e Inequalities
may be made up by prudent Conduct on both
Sides; that no Man mu&s;t expect a Life of per|fect
&s;uitability; that Tempers, Opinions, Pa&s;|&s;ions,
De&s;ires, Aver&s;ions, Ends and Aims, &s;hould
all agree; and, above all, that even where they
cla&s;h and di&s;agree, yet there is no ab&s;olute nece&s;|&s;ity
that they &s;hould interrupt the felicity of Life,
make Matrimony a kind of Damnation, the
Hou&s;e a <HI>Bedlam,</HI> and the Conver&s;ation a Hell,
a State of Strife, Rage, Fury, and eternal Con|tention.
All this I grant.</P>
<P>BUT if they &s;hall add, that therefore the&s;e
things are Trifles, are of no Moment; that they
are not worth interrupting the other Views of
Matrimony, and that they are to be referred to
after Di&s;cretion on both Sides. He that &s;hall
talk thus &s;eriou&s;ly, all I can &s;ay to him is, I
am &s;orry for his Head. It is true, that Pru|dence
will go a great Way towards reconciling
un&s;uitable Things; and Chri&s;tians will learn
by the Chri&s;tian Law to abate on both Sides,
<HI>forbearing one another in love.</HI></P>
<P>NAY, I'll go farther: Continual Jarrings in
Families &s;ometimes find a Time of Truce, and
the Husband and Wife, like two Combatants,
wearied with Blows, lie &s;till and take Breath.
But alas, what is this! 'tis but to recover
Strength for a more furious Rencounter; the
lucid Intervals being over, the Fire rekindles;
the Pa&s;&s;ions break out and burn with the more
Force, the Rage is redoubled; and we may &s;ay
<PB N="215" REF="231">
of &s;uch, as the Scripture &s;ays in another Ca&s;e,
<HI>The la&s;t End of tho&s;e Families is wor&s;e than the
Beginning.</HI></P>
<P>THE Inequalities then, and un&s;uitable Things
from whence the&s;e Feuds take life, and are
kindled up to a Flame, are far from Trifles;
the Fire of hou&s;hold Strife burns <HI>to the lowe&s;t
Hell;</HI> 'tis an unquenchable Flame; 'tis kindled
in Trifles; that may be, and is often true.
But tho&s;e Trifles &s;et the Fire, and nothing but
a Wi&s;dom, more than is generally to be found
in human Nature, can extingui&s;h it.</P>
<P>THESE un&s;uitable Things then, ought with
the utmo&s;t Precaution, to be guarded again&s;t,
&s;earch'd for, &s;hunned and avoided, in our fir&s;t
Thoughts about Matrimony; e&s;pecially if we
have any Views of Felicity in a married State.
For here all future Unhappine&s;&s;es of married
Mortals begin.</P>
<P>TAKE it Matrimonially; take it as it is a
Partner&s;hip, for Matrimony it &s;elf is but a
Partner&s;hip; though 'tis not a Partner&s;hip in
Trade, 'tis what is ten thou&s;and times more
&s;olemn, 'tis a Partner&s;hip in Life; a Part|ner&s;hip
of Souls, they are embarked in the &s;ame
Ship, they go the &s;ame Voyage, and, give me
leave to &s;ay, they &s;wim, they &s;ink, they are
happy, they are mi&s;erable, they are poor, they
are rich, ju&s;t as they agree, or not agree; Love
or Hate, are united or not united; they go on
hand in hand, and have but one Fate; they ri&s;e
and fall, are ble&s;t or curs'd, nay, I believe I
might add, (with but few Exceptions) they are
&s;aved or damned together.</P>
<P>NOR let this be cen&s;ured for &s;uch an extra|vagant
Expre&s;&s;ion as it may &s;eem at fir&s;t Sight;
for if it be a nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence of Family
<PB N="216" REF="232">
Di&s;orders, that the Pa&s;&s;ions are in a general
Di&s;order on both Sides, by mutual Provocati|ons.
(And how is it po&s;&s;ible to be otherwi&s;e.)
How then can it be, but that they mu&s;t Sin to|gether,
mu&s;t provoke one another to all tho&s;e
Offences which naturally attend an enraged
Mind, an envenom'd Spirit, and a Soul imbit

bitter and cutting Reproaches, undue and in|decent

Railing and Cur&s;ing; till, in &s;hort, they
pu&s;h one another on to the Gates of Hell,
and need no Devil but their own ungoverned
Rage, to thru&s;t them in.</P>
<P>ALL this, and more, if more can be thought
of, is the Product of Inequalities in Matrimo|ny,
un&s;uitable Matches, a joyning Things to|gether
that will not, and cannot joyn; as I
&s;aid, they may be tyed together, but cannot
be joyned, joyned but cannot be united. Such
Marriages are to me little le&s;s than a Sentence
of Condemnation to a perpetual State of Mi|&s;ery.
The Man or Woman thus married, is
&s;entenced as the <HI>Romans</HI> &s;entenced <HI>Nero</HI> to die,
<HI>More Majorum,</HI> that was, to have his Head put
into a Collar of Iron, or kind of Pillory, and to
be &s;courged to Death; they are condemned to
be tyed together, and to be worry'd to Death.</P>
<P>TO marry two Per&s;ons together that are of
contrary Di&s;po&s;itions, un&s;uitable Tempers,
di&s;proportioned Years, and the like, is like the
Way of puni&s;hing Malefactors in <HI>Per&s;ia, viz.</HI>
tying the living Body to a dead Corp&s;e, till the
rotting Carca&s;s poi&s;oned the living, and then
they rotted together.</P>

from whence there is no return; nothing but
the King of Terrors can open the Jayl; and
'tis then but an even lay between the Man and
his Wife, who goes out fir&s;t; and if when the
Jaylor comes, the Devil comes with him, 'tis
but one to one who he calls for, nay, if they
have lived the Life I &s;peak of, as is very pro|bable,
they may even do what they never did,
that is to &s;ay, agree for a Moment, and go to|gether.</P>
<P>WHAT
then can the Man or Woman be &s;aid
to be doing, that ventures upon Matrimony with|out
&s;tudiou&s;ly con&s;idering and con&s;ulting the
Suitabilities that offer in the Ca&s;e, without &s;it|ting
down and judging &s;edately, at lea&s;t from
what is apparent, what may probably be the
Ca&s;e afterwards? If they are &s;en&s;ible of their
own Infirmities, let them calculate for them|&s;elves,
as doubtle&s;s any Man or Woman might
do, what will be their Ca&s;e: As every one that
looks into his own Con&s;cience may, if he will
be impartial to him&s;elf, make a Judgment of
his eternal State, &s;o every one that will look
into their own Temper, and impartially compare
it with the Circum&s;tances and Di&s;po&s;ition of
<PB N="218" REF="234">
the Per&s;on they are to be married to, may make
a tolerable Judgment of what their Condition
will be after Marriage; and accordingly they
may and ought to venture, or not to ven|ture:
A venture it is at be&s;t, becau&s;e after you
have done your utmo&s;t, you may be mi&s;taken,
may be deceived, and, after the utmo&s;t Cau|tion,
&s;ome un&s;uitable Things mu&s;t be expect|ed:
You mu&s;t expect Difficulties, and to have
many Things to &s;truggle with, an Exerci&s;e for
all your Virtue, all your Self-denial, all your
Temper; as long as Fle&s;h and Blood is a Com|po&s;ition
of Contraries and incon&s;i&s;tent Hu|mours,
there will be &s;omething always left to
try your Patience, to try your Chri&s;tianity,
and which, being con&s;idered, makes it the
more needful to u&s;e the utmo&s;t Precaution in
the Choice.</P>
<P>I am not going to give Directions here how
to &s;earch into the&s;e un&s;uitable Things, how to
judge of them, and how to di&s;tingui&s;h Tem|pers;
that would be a Work too voluminous
for this Place: But one general Caution may,
for ought I know, if well followed, be as good
as a hundred Sheets of Paper filled with Words
of le&s;s Signification. The Caution is &s;hort,
and ea&s;y to be under&s;tood; whether it be ea&s;y to
be put in Practice or no, that you mu&s;t judge
from your &s;elves. It is, in few Words, this:
<HI>Study well your own Temper fir&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>HOW &s;hall any Man or Woman know whe|tlier
the Temper of the Woman or Man they
are about to marry be &s;uitable to them, and
$$ay concur to their future Felicity, if they
do not fir&s;t know their own? I remember a Gen|tleman
of Quality and Fortune who courted
a Lady a long while, and their Fortunes and
<PB N="219" REF="235">
all other Circum&s;tances agreeing, they were at
la&s;t married; while the Matrimony was de|pending,
he happened to be talking with ano|ther
Gentleman, who was his Intimate, and
who knew the Lady; and he was congratulat|ing
him&s;elf, if I may be allowed &s;uch an Ex|pre&s;&s;ion,
upon the good Pro&s;pect of his Affairs,
and the Felicity which he promi&s;ed him&s;elf in
his Match; the Fortune, the Wit, the Beauty,
the good Humour of the Lady he was Court|ing;
to all which the other Gentleman gave
the A&s;&s;ent of his own Opinion, from a long
Acquaintance in the Lady's Family, and with
her Per&s;on.</P>
<P>BUT, after all, &s;ays the Gentleman who
courted this Lady, there's one main Thing re|mains
which I cannot come at, and upon which
almo&s;t all the re&s;t depends.</P>
<P>WHAT can that be, <HI>&s;ays the other Gentleman;</HI>
I think there's nothing in the Lady but what
may make any Gentleman happy.</P>
<P>WHY, <HI>&s;ays the fir&s;t Gentleman,</HI> I cannot learn
any thing of her Temper.</P>
<P>O, &s;ays the other, &s;he is of a very good Tem|per.</P>
<P>AY, <HI>&s;ays the fir&s;t,</HI> when &s;he is Pleas'd, &s;o,
they &s;ay, is &s;omebody el&s;e; but I want to
&s;ee her Angry. Pray, did you ever &s;ee her
Angry?</P>
<P>YES, I have &s;een her Angry too, <HI>&s;ays his
Friend.</HI></P>
<P>WELL, and how was &s;he then, <HI>&s;ays he.</HI> is
&s;he a furious little Devil when &s;he's pro|voked?</P>
<P>NAY, <HI>&s;ays his Friend,</HI> that's according as the
Provocation is. Every Body is &s;ubject to Pro|vocation,
and all People have Pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="236">
AY, <HI>&s;ays the courting Gentleman,</HI> but is &s;he
not apt to be angry, &s;oon provoked, a little Pot
&s;oon hot.</P>
<P>WHY, <HI>&s;ays his Friend,</HI> if &s;he were, &s;he is &s;oon
cold again, that I can a&s;&s;ure you, and the good
Humour returns again immediately.</P>
<P>WELL, <HI>&s;ays the fir&s;t,</HI> with a Sigh, pray GOD
&s;he be not a pa&s;&s;ionate Creature, for if &s;he is,
we &s;hall be the unhappie&s;t Couple that ever
came together.</P>
<P>WHY &s;o, <HI>&s;ays his Friend.</HI></P>
<P>WHY, <HI>&s;ays the fir&s;t Gentleman,</HI> becau&s;e I know
my own Temper too.</P>
<P>YOUR own Temper, <HI>&s;ays his Friend;</HI> why,
what is your own Temper, I &s;ee nothing in
your Temper but what the Lady may be very
happy in.</P>
<P>IT may be you don't, <HI>&s;ays the Gentleman,</HI> but
I do; I tell you, I am a pa&s;&s;ionate fiery Dog,
and I can't help it; a Word awry, the lea&s;t un|kind
or provoking &s;ets me all in a Flame im|mediately,
like the Line&s;tock to the Cannon;
I fire off as &s;oon as I am touch'd, and make a
Devili&s;h noi&s;e.</P>
<P>YOU je&s;t with your &s;elf, <HI>&s;ays his Friend;</HI> but
I don't take you to be &s;o bad as you repre&s;ent
your &s;elf.</P>
<P>THAT'S becau&s;e you don't know me &s;o well
as I know my &s;elf, <HI>&s;ays the Gentleman.</HI></P>
<P>WELL, well, <HI>&s;ays his Friend,</HI> if you are hot
together, you will cool together.</P>
<P>THAT'S &s;mall &s;atisfaction to me, <HI>&s;ays the
Gentleman,</HI> becau&s;e I can't promi&s;e it of my
Side.</P>
<P>BUT I'll promi&s;e you on her Side, <HI>&s;ays his
Friend,</HI> that one kind Word will cool her
<PB N="221" REF="237">
again immediately, and then &s;he's all Good|ne&s;s
and Sweetne&s;s in a Moment.</P>
<P>AY, &s;o a Word or two will cool me, <HI>&s;ays the
Gentleman.</HI> But who will yield to give the cool|ing
Word fir&s;t, there's the Difficulty.</P>
<P>WHY you mu&s;t, <HI>&s;ays his Friend,</HI> 'tis your
Place; 'tis the Man's Place you know, always
to &s;ubmit to his Wife.</P>
<P>I can't an&s;wer for my &s;elf, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I know I
am apt to be very hot.</P>
<P>AND what will you do them? <HI>&s;ays his Friend;</HI>
you &s;hould have confidered this before.</P>
<P>NAY, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I mu&s;t venture now, 'tis too
late to go back.</P>
<P>SO, upon the whole, they did venture; and
two Pieces of Wild-fire they were; and, in a
very few Months after their Marriage, the Ef|fects
of it appeared in a manner hardly fit to
be repeated; and all this only, becau&s;e when
it was con&s;ulted and di&s;cour&s;ed about, it was too
late to go back, &s;o that, in a word, the Gentle|man
had as good not have con&s;idered it at
all; for con&s;idering after 'tis done, is no con&s;i|derig.</P>
<P>IT is remarkable, however, in the Di&s;cour&s;e
above, that the Gentleman's Concern about the
Temper of the Lady he was going to marry,
was occa&s;ioned chiefly from a con&s;cious Know|ledge
of his own; and this was the Rea&s;on of
my telling his Story. For if we would make a
right Judgment of our own Di&s;po&s;ition fir&s;t, we
&s;hould the &s;ooner &s;ee whether we &s;hould be
&s;uitably match'd to the Per&s;on propos'd; it is
not indeed the ea&s;i&s;t thing in the World to
know the Humour and Di&s;po&s;ition of one ano|ther,
e&s;pecially not in a Month or two, of a
courting Conver&s;ation; yet as all Judgment of
<PB N="222" REF="238">
that kind &s;hould take its Ri&s;e from the Know|ledge
of our own Di&s;po&s;ition fir&s;t, it becomes
every one to &s;tudy well their own Temper, and
to learn to judge impartially of them&s;elves,
which, by the Way, is not the ea&s;ie&s;t Thing in
the World to do.</P>
<P>YOU may know whether you are of a com|plying,
yielding, abating Temper or no; whe|ther
you can bear Provocations, and make no
return till the Heat is over, and then admoni&s;h
Calmly; or whether you are full of Re&s;ent|ment,
Furious, apt to take Fire, and long a
quenching; whether you are Rough or Smooth,
Tender or Har&s;h; in a word, whether your
Temper is fit for another to bear, or able to
bear with another as unfit to be born with as
your own: From our own Tempers thus im|partially
judged of, we might very often, I do
not &s;ay always, determine and choo&s;e for our
&s;elves with Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT now, to bring this down to the Ca&s;e be|fore
me. What mu&s;t we &s;ay of that Matri|mony,
which is concluded in &s;pite of all the
Knowledge and Di&s;covery, either of the other
Per&s;ons Temper, or of our own? That is carried
on by Appetite, by the Gu&s;t of Inclination, by
a View of the Out&s;ide only, without con&s;ult|ing
any thing but the Face; without inquiring
into the Qualifications, the Temper, the Hu|mour,
the Capacities, or any of the Decora|tions
of the Mind. What is all this but a meer
vitiated De&s;ire, a Corruption, and, I may &s;ay,
a depravity of the Judgment, without Sen&s;e of
Virtue, or value for the Accompli&s;hments of
the Soul; in a word, what is it but a Matri|monial
Whoredom?</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="239">
AND what are the Con&s;equences? And how
do the&s;e Con&s;equences prove the thing? namely,
that when the corrupted Gu&s;t is &s;atiated, when the
fir&s;t Heats are over, and Souls begin to conver&s;e
together, then they begin to Repent and Repine,
they &s;ee an End of their Happine&s;s ju&s;t where
other People find the Beginning of theirs. In a
word, the Man and the Woman remains, but the
Husband and Wife are lo&s;t; the Conjunction holds,
but the Union is lo&s;t; the Marriage is fixed and
fa&s;t, but the Matrimony is gone; in a word,
there's the Whoredom without the Matrimony,
the vitious Part without the virtuous, the humid
without the &s;ublime; there's the married Cou|ple
without their Souls; their Affections are
no more united than the Poles, and like the
living and the dead Body I mentioned ju&s;t
now, they are only Bound to one another, that
at la&s;t they may Rot together.</P>
<P>HORRID Matrimony! horrid di&s;cording
Tempers, raging Pa&s;&s;ions, outrageous Words,
hot fiery Breakings out of ill-natured, bitter
and &s;candalous Reflections; the&s;e &s;um up the
Family Conver&s;ation between them: The&s;e
form the Felicity that they have to expect:
The&s;e are the Productions of hot-headed, un&s;uit|able
Wedlock; of marrying without Thought,
taking a Woman purely for a Woman, or a
Man meerly to have a Man; in a word, &s;uch
marrying is, in my Sen&s;e, no better or wor&s;e
than a Matrimonial Whoredom.</P>
<P>NOW, as I &s;aid in the Beginning of this
Chapter, the Obligations of the Marriage Co|venant
or Vow are mutual and reciprocal; the
Band is equal, the Burthen is equally divided;
And this is it that makes the di&s;cording Tem|pers,
the un&s;uitable Circum&s;tances of which $
<PB N="224" REF="240">
am now entrig upon the Particulars of, &s;o fatal:
Marriage is a Yoke, &s;o it is very well repre|&s;ented,
in which the Creatures yoked are to
draw together. If they are unequally yoked,
what is the Con&s;equence? the Plough goes not
forward, the weak Hor&s;e draws all the Load,
and is oppre&s;s'd, and, at length, both &s;ink to|gether;
the Family is confu&s;ed; the Affairs of
it are at a Stand; the Family-Peace is de&s;troy|ed;
the Intere&s;t of it neglected; and, in a
word, all goes wrong, till at la&s;t Ruin breaks
in, and both the unhappy Creatures are lo&s;t
and de&s;troyed together.</P>
<P>THIS being the Ca&s;e, the Inequalities and
Un&s;uitables of Matrimony are far from being
Trifles, that are to be di&s;regarded and ventured
on, unle&s;s by &s;uch People to whom it is in|different,
whether they live happy or no, and
that can be as happy with an un&s;uitable Match
as with a &s;uitable one. I know there are &s;uch
Kinds of People in the World, who&s;e very
Souls are indolent and a&s;leep; who receive no
Impre&s;&s;ions of Grief or Joy, Pain or Plea&s;ure
and who&s;e Minds are, as it were, perfectly pa&s;|&s;ive
in Life; unconcerned in whatever happens
to them, that neither look before them or be|hind
them, one Way or t'other, but ri&s;e in the
Morning to go to Bed at Night, ri&s;e up on pur|po&s;e
to &s;it down again, and &s;it down only to
ri&s;e up. The&s;e are indeed fit to marry in this
manner; they are the Family of the Ea&s;y
Ones, and to them 'tis all one to be happy or
unhappy, ble&s;s'd or unble&s;s'd, quiet or unquiet;
Frowns are all one to them as Smiles, and bad
Words as good; they neither Ta&s;te the &s;our or
the &s;weet; the Mu&s;ick of the Viol, or the
Scraping of a Kettle, is alike to them, and
<PB N="225" REF="241">
they di&s;tingui&s;h not between Good and Evil.
All I can &s;ay to &s;uch, is only this, that at pre|&s;ent
I am not talking of them, or to them; I
am rather directing my Speech to the rational
Part of Mankind, who aim at a Happine&s;s in
this Life, and under&s;tand what it means; who
de&s;ire to live like Men, and like Chri&s;tians,
and know how to do &s;o; and, for this very
Rea&s;on would match them&s;elves with &s;uch,
and &s;uch only, as have the like ju&s;t Notions,
and under&s;tand what a Life of Enjoyment
means, as well as them&s;elves.</P>
<P>TO the&s;e, I &s;ay again, that all Inequalities
in a &s;tate of Marriage, are as &s;o many Wounds
in the Body, which, if left to Nature, will
fe&s;ter and inflame, and, at length mortify,
and be fatal; at be&s;t they require a great deal
of Surgery, Plai&s;tering, and, perhaps, Open|ing
and Inci&s;ion, to cure and re&s;tore them;
but are abundantly better and ea&s;ier prevented
than cured, be the Skill ever &s;o great: In &s;hort,
all Inequalities are Di&s;ea&s;es in, Marriage, and
all Di&s;ea&s;es are be&s;t cured by Anticipation;
for, as the Learned &s;ay, Errors in the fir&s;t Con|coction
are not remedied in the &s;econd; but
the ill Dige&s;ture affects all the natural Opera|tions,
till at la&s;t it reaches the Blood and
animal Spirits, and there contracts Capital Di&s;|ea&s;es.</P>
<P>TO conclude: Let all tho&s;e that expect Feli|city
in the married Life, that have the lea&s;t
View beyond the &s;en&s;uality of the Brutes, and
look on any thing in Marriage beyond the
bridal Bed; I &s;ay, let them &s;tudy to Match
with proper and equal Circum&s;tances; with
Per&s;ons, as near as po&s;&s;ible, &s;uitable to them|&s;elves,
and that in all the Particulars, of which
<PB N="226" REF="242">
I &s;hall give the detail in the next Chapter.
Whether my Advice be of Weight or not, I
refer to what follows.</P>
<P>I am told, in the very Moment of writing
this Head, that to talk of Inequalities and Un|&s;uitable
Things in marrying, is too general;
that 'tis an Amu&s;ement only, and gives no
light into my Meaning. A young Man mar|ries
a Wife, his Thoughts are to be &s;ure upon
having a &s;uitable Bedfellow, a plea&s;ant, agree|able,
hand&s;ome Woman, to divert him&s;elf, and
to &s;port with. What do we tell him of Ine|qualities
and Un&s;uitablene&s;s? he knows no|thing
of it; I mu&s;t explain my &s;elf.</P>
<P>IN obedience to the Ignorance of the Ob|jector,
and &s;uppo&s;ing it the Sen&s;e of the Times,
I &s;hall explain my &s;elf accordingly: And fir&s;t,
I grant, that young Gentlemen now act ju&s;t as
the Objection is &s;tated; they marry, get a
Fortune and a Bedfellow, and that is all they
trouble them&s;elves about. The Ca&s;e is excel|lently
well expre&s;s'd by my Lord <HI>Roche&s;ter:</HI>
<Q><L>&startq;With an E&s;tate, no Wit, and a young Wife,</L>
<L>The &s;olid Comforts of a Coxcomb's Life.&endq;</L>
<L>Roch. Art. to Clo.</L></Q></P>
<P>I grant, I &s;ay, that this is much of the Ca&s;e
before me; and this is that makes &s;o much Ma|trimonial
Whoredom in the World: This is the
very E&s;&s;ence of the Crime I am reproving, namely,
that the married People look to the <HI>Coxcomb's
Comforts,</HI> not to thereal Comforts of a married Life,
to the Enjoyments of the Night, not the Enjoy|ments
of the Day; to what's pre&s;ent, not what's
to come; and while they do &s;o, no wonder we
have &s;uch dreadful Family-Doings as we have
<PB N="227" REF="243">
in the World. Such Strife, &s;uch Breaches,
&s;uch Family-Wickedne&s;s! While the End for
which they marry, and that kind of vitious
Love which brought them together la&s;ts, they
run out in their wicked Midnight Exce&s;&s;es one
Way; and when that Love is cool'd, the viti|ous
Flame quenched, the Fire extingui&s;hed,
there being no &s;olid Affection founded upon
Virtue and true Merit; they run out into their
Day-light Exce&s;&s;es another Way; I mean, jar|ring,
&s;candalous Contention and Di&s;cord.
Thus the fir&s;t Part of Life is Matrimonial
Whoredom, and the la&s;t Part Matrimonial
Madne&s;s.</P>
<P>BY all this, I think, 'tis apparent that,
next to Virtue and Religion, Suitability is the
only &s;olid Foundation on which the Conjugal
Felicity is grounded; and un&s;uitable Matches
ought to be avoided with our utmo&s;t Care.
And that I may explain my &s;elf at large, and
becau&s;e the&s;e un&s;uitable Things are too many,
and have too great Ob&s;tructions attending
them to be contained in a general Defini|tion,
and more than at fir&s;t Sight &s;eems pro|bable,
take them in the following Particulars,
all of them really incon&s;i&s;tent with the Feli|city
of Marriage.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Un&s;uitable Years.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Un&s;uitable in Quality.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Un&s;uitable E&s;tates.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Un&s;uitable Tempers.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Un&s;uitable Principles of Religion.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>OF all the&s;e I &s;hould &s;peak di&s;tinctly, and
employ di&s;tant Chapters upon &s;ome of them; nor
would it be remote to the De&s;ign of this Work to
<PB N="228" REF="244">
do &s;o upon all of them; but I &s;tudy brevity; and
I am very far from having a barren Subject be|fore
me; I have rather more Matter than can
be brought into the Compa&s;s I have pre&s;cribed
to my &s;elf; yet Things mu&s;t be explained as I
go, and e&s;pecially becau&s;e they all tend to
make the married Life unhappy, though they
may not be all equally fatal. I'll run them over
therefore, in a &s;ummary Way, for the pre&s;ent,
the Per&s;ons guilty will have room enough to
enlarge in their own Reflections &s;eparately, and
as it &s;uits their Ca&s;e; for the &s;candalous Ine|qualities
of &s;uch Marriages as I aim at, are too
many; no Man will &s;ay, there is a want of
Examples.</P>
<P>NOR are the Inequalities of Matching, as
they are now managed, e&s;pecially by the Ladies,
of &s;o light a Con&s;equence, and &s;o in&s;ignificant
as &s;ome would make them; and let but the La|dies
reflect a little upon the melancholy Cir|cum&s;tances
of &s;ome of their Sex, who warm'd
thus by the &s;ecret Heats of Nature, which they
have afterwards been &s;en&s;ible of, they have
thrown them&s;elves away in the &s;candalous man|ner
I have mentioned, with what Self-Reproaches
have they loaded them&s;elves, when they have
&s;een them&s;elves in the Arms of Scoundrels and
Brutes, who, at other times, they would have
loathed the Thoughts of, and who they live to
abhor with as compleat an Aver&s;ion, after the&s;e
unhappy Heats are cool'd, as ever they did be|fore.
But of this in its Place.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Marrying at Un&s;uitable Years.</HEAD>
<P>_IT is true, that the Laws of Matrimony
have not pre&s;cribed us to Years, ex|cept
in the Ca&s;e of Infancy and Child|hood,
and the Rea&s;ons for that are
obvious; but, as is mentioned before,
where the Laws are Silent, there the general
Rules of Rea&s;on and Religion take Place, and
are Laws to Chri&s;tians and to Men of Rea&s;on,
as is the Ca&s;e of our Limitations in Meats and
Drinks. We are not limited or directed to
what, when, or how much we &s;hall eat or
drink; but all Exce&s;&s;es in either are &s;inful; and
&s;o all &s;candalous and indecent Things among
Chri&s;tians are &s;inful and unlawful; and the
Rules of Decency and Sobriety have certainly
the Force of Laws to tho&s;e who profe&s;s them|&s;elves
Chri&s;tians, as much as if they were ex|pre&s;sly
mentioned in the Decalogue it &s;elf.</P>
<P>NOW to judge of Decency with re&s;pect to
the di&s;parity of Years in Per&s;ons marrying, I
think we need go no farther than to bring it
down to the original Word, Mode&s;ty, of which
I took notice in the Introduction; and, I think,
this may pa&s;s for a Maxim, that what can't be
Mode&s;t is not Decent; or, if you will, tran&s;|po&s;e
the Particles <HI>is</HI> and <HI>can,</HI> and read it thus:

That what is not Mode&s;t cannot be Decent.
If then Chri&s;tians are to do Things of good

Mode&s;t, are forbidden them. How the Practice
of our modern Chri&s;tians in this particular Ar|ticle

<P>IT
is the Opinion of &s;ome, that after there
is no more room to expect Children, it is not
lawful to marry. Nor are the People who are
of this Opinion, the loo&s;er or weaker Part of
Mankind; but the &s;erious, &s;olid and religious,

they ground it upon this very Text, <HI>Phil.</HI> iv.
8. <HI>of good Report;</HI> and upon comparing this
with what is expre&s;sly mentioned in the Office
of Matrimony, namely, that the principal End
of Matrimony, as an Ordinance or In&s;titution
of GOD, is for the lawful Procreation of Chil|dren.
Now to what End then, &s;ay they, is
Matrimony, when the Per&s;on, that is, the Wo|man
in particular, is pa&s;t Child-bearing? All
the re&s;t can be nothing but what is not &s;it to

that another Rea&s;on of Matrimony is to pre|vent
Fornication, <HI>Remed. Amoris.</HI></P>
<P>NOW if the married Couple are pa&s;t Chil|dren,
one would think too, it &s;hould be time for
them to quit the other Plea; and then let them
tell us, if they can without Blu&s;hes, whether
they have any Plea for Matrimony, that does
not come within my Title, <HI>viz. Conjugal Lewd|ne&s;s,</HI>
or Matrimonial Whoredom? There are
many &s;candalous Things might be &s;aid upon
this Subject, but I turn it all another Way,
and had rather mention it by Way of Que&s;tion;

let the Parties an&s;wer it, if they can, with|out
Breach of Decency. I dare &s;ay they will
find it difficult; and yet there may be more
Mode&s;ty in the An&s;wer, than there is in the
Thing it &s;elf too.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE the Lady to be about Five and
fifty; and the Que&s;tion is fir&s;t put to her, Whe|ther
&s;he has any room to expect Children, or
whether &s;he thinks it po&s;&s;ible, in the ordinary
U&s;age or Cour&s;e of Nature, that &s;he &s;hould have
any Children? And this Lady marries, whether a
younger Per&s;on than her &s;elf, or not, tho' that is
ordinarily the Ca&s;e; but &s;uppo&s;e, for the pre&s;ent,
not a young Man, becau&s;e I &s;hall &s;peak of that
Part by it &s;elf. Now what can be a lawful or
mode&s;t Rea&s;on for this Matrimony? or if we
&s;hould &s;ay to this Lady, <HI>Pray,</HI> Madam, <HI>why did
you marry?</HI> what could &s;he &s;ay.</P>
<P>TO &s;ay &s;he married in hopes of Children,
that could not be; 'tis foreclo&s;ed in the Begin|ning
of the Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>TO &s;ay &s;he married for one to look after her
Affairs, that could not be; that's foreclo&s;ed too,
by &s;uppo&s;ing her to be in good Circum&s;tances,
and to have her E&s;tate all &s;ettled and firm.</P>
<P>TO &s;ay &s;he does it to avoid Fornication, Mo|de&s;ty,
if &s;he is Mi&s;tre&s;s of any, will forbid her
talking in that manner.</P>
<P>SHE has, indeed, nothing to &s;ay, but to
Blu&s;h and look down; to acknowledge that &s;he
did it to gratify (as the Poet expre&s;&s;es it mo|de&s;tly)
a <HI>frailer Part;</HI> in &s;hort, &s;he ought to
&s;ay, that &s;he married meerly to <HI>lie with a
MAN.</HI> And is not this Matrimonial Whore|dom?
If not, what then mu&s;t it be called, and by
what Words, that will not be Criminal in them|&s;elves,
can we expre&s;s it?</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="248">
SUPPOSE the Lady to have no Occa&s;ion to
better her Fortune, her Circum&s;tances being
very good, and indeed, in &s;uch Ca&s;es they &s;el|dom
better their Fortunes, but wor&s;t them.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE her to have no want of a Steward

Rent, paid her Quaterly, or Intere&s;ts of
Stocks, or any other Certainty that takes tho&s;e

&s;candalous Things, and much dirty Pains are
taken by the guilty Ladies, to cover the Action
from the ju&s;t Reflections which the World ca&s;ts
upon them. But when they are examined to
the Bottom, 'tis evident, that, as the Prophet
<HI>I&s;aiah &s;ays, the Covering is too narrow, and the

<P>BUT to come clo&s;er to the Ca&s;e. Here is a
Lady of fifty or &s;ixty Years of Age, &s;he has
had Children in her younger Years, but has
left Bearing for ten or twenty Years, and is
pa&s;t not the Probability only, but even the
Po&s;&s;ibilty, according to Nature, of Bearing
any more. But this Woman ca&s;ting her vi|tiated
Eyes upon a young Fellow of twenty|five
or thirty Years old, perhaps her Ser|vant,
her Book-keeper, or her late Husband's
Steward, or &s;ome meaner Per&s;on, &s;he pre&s;ently
takes Care to let him know, that he may be ad|mitted,
if he will pu&s;h at it. The young Fel|low
takes the Occa&s;ion, and, making his ea&s;y
Intere&s;t, &s;he marries him.</P>
<P>IF any Man is di&s;plea&s;ed at my calling this

<P>WELL, Madam, and will your Lady&s;hip have
this young Fellow then? I profe&s;s, 'tis &s;canda|lous.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="253">
WHY, I think I mu&s;t, Cou&s;in: He is a hand|&s;ome,
jolly, brisk Fellow' <HI>&s;ays my Lady;</HI> I can|not
&s;ay but I like him.</P>
<P>NAY, if you want a brisk young Fellow,
<HI>&s;ays the Cou&s;in.</HI></P>
<P>I don't &s;ay, I want him for that. But what
would you have me take, a Skeleton?</P>
<P>THERE is a long Part of the Dialogue &s;till
behind, in which the old Lady confe&s;s'd &s;ome
Things, in Confidence to her Cou&s;in, which,
though extraordinary well to my Purpo&s;e, will
not &s;o well bear reading; and therefore I omit
them. But, in a word, the Lady took this young
Fellow, and &s;he was as Unhappy with him as
could be imagined; &s;he &s;ettled Two hundred
Pounds a Year upon him for his Life; and, in
a word, he broke her Heart; and he lived upon
it afterward, till he anticipated the Income of
it, &s;old his Life in it, &s;pent the Money, and
died in Jail; all which he richly de&s;erved, for
he was a Brute to her, however brutal her mar|rying
of him was.</P>
<P>NOW what was all this but Matrimonial
Whoredom? &s;he married him for nothing more
or le&s;s but the meer Thing called a Bedfellow;
and he took her to be her Servant, to give it no
wor&s;e a Name, and to have a Settlement of
Two hundred Pounds a Year for his Pains.</P>
<P>BUT we have gro&s;&s;er Examples than this,
and that near our own Days, and within our
own Knowledge. A certain Lady, and of a
great Fortune too, at the Age of &s;ixty-four,
not many Days ago, took into her Service, as I
may very ju&s;tly call it, a young Clergyman of
four and twenty, a hand&s;om, jolly Gentleman,
who might have had Wives enough, and &s;uit|able
<PB N="238" REF="254">
to him&s;elf, and &s;uch as might have made
him happy, having a tolerable Benefice, which
he lived comfortably upon.</P>
<P>BUT Avarice, and the View of enjoying &s;even
hundred Pounds a Year, a Coach and four, with
all the <HI>Addenda</HI> that a Man of Sen&s;e knew
well how to Comfort him&s;elf with, prevailed
with him to tye him&s;elf down to the &s;our Ap|ple
Tree, and he &s;ubmits to the &s;ervile Drudgery,
and marries her.</P>
<P>AND here the Con&s;equence fell hard on the
Man's Side. Fir&s;t, &s;he grew un&s;ufferably Cove|tous,
and &s;o Narrow, that, keeping her Revenue
in her own Hands, &s;he hardly allowed him Ex|pences
for his daily Sub&s;i&s;tence: In the next
Place, &s;he was jealous of him to a kind of Mad|ne&s;s
and Di&s;traction; and, in a word, he was
forced to threaten to leave her, and turn her
off again, before he could obtain any tolerable
U&s;age.</P>
<P>NOW what did this Lady marry for? What
retence could &s;he po&s;&s;ibly make for it, but
this Matrimonial Whoredom that I &s;peak of?
It is hardly po&s;&s;ible to a&s;&s;ign any other Rea&s;on,
at lea&s;t, that will &s;upport it &s;elf, or that any
one can defend. She lived perfectly ea&s;y, had
her Friends about her, the E&s;tate was in her
own hand, and &s;he wanted no help to look after
her Rents; for it's apparent, after her Marriage,
&s;he did it without him.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, 'tis evident the End of that &s;can|dalous
Match was vi&s;ible to the World; there
could not be one mode&s;t Word &s;aid for it; at
lea&s;t, that could carry any Weight in it;
and the Town have u&s;ed her accordingly; for
&s;he is the Reproach of all Company, the Scorn
and Scandal of her Sex, the Talk of all the
<PB N="239" REF="255">
Tea-Tables and A&s;&s;emblies round about; the poor
Drudge, who &s;he has taken into pay, is pitied
by every Body; and the Town where he lives,
it is doubted, will make a Bonfire, when &s;he is
plea&s;ed to walk off, and congratulate him by
all the Methods &s;uitable to the Sen&s;e of his De|liverance.</P>
<P>WHEN
an old Man of &s;eventy or eighty
marries a young Girl of twenty, we have ge|nerally
&s;ome Game among the common People
about it. But here there may not be &s;o much
room for Scandal, becau&s;e it has often happen|ed,
that Men have had Children at a very
great Age; and there may be extraordinary Rea|&s;ons
for them to de&s;ire Children; as particu|larly
for the enjoying E&s;tates, to which they
have no Heirs. But be the Rea&s;ons what they
will, the Thing is unque&s;tioned becau&s;e lawful,
and the having Children is po&s;&s;ible; &s;o that
the great End and Rea&s;on of Matrimony is
not de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>BUT what &s;hall we &s;ay when two antient
People, the Woman pa&s;t Children, and the Man
al&s;o: What do the&s;e join together for? And
which of the Ends of Matrimony are to be
an&s;wered in their Conjunctions? I ob&s;erve, the
World are generally reconciled to tho&s;e Matches
becau&s;e of the Parity of Circum&s;tances; and
they ordinarily expre&s;s them&s;elves thus: Well,
let them marry, there's no great di&s;proportion
in their Age; ay, ay, why &s;hould they not
marry? they are very well match'd, the Man's
almo&s;t Three&s;core, and the Woman is not much
le&s;s, they'll do very well together; &s;o there's
little or no Scandal rais'd here, I mean, in the
Mouths of the common Cen&s;urers of &s;uch
Things.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="256">
BUT I differ from the common Opinion here
exceedingly; and I mu&s;t &s;ay, that, in my Opi|nion,
this is as much or more, a Matrimonial
Whoredom than the other. The Rea&s;on is the
&s;ame; the Occa&s;ion of Matrimony is the &s;ame,
with this difference notwith&s;tanding, and to the
Di&s;advantage of the latter Ca&s;e; for that, in
the fir&s;t Ca&s;e, the lewd Part lay wholly upon
the Woman, here it lies upon them both:
where the old Lady married the young Man,
the Matrimonial Whoredom could lye only on
her Side; but here the equality of Years makes
an equality of Guilt; there was a &s;ingle Shame,
here a double; and I am much mi&s;taken, if
two being guilty makes the Offence le&s;s than
one.</P>
<P>WHAT can two People at tho&s;e Years &s;ay
for marrying, &s;eeing they know they can have
no Children? It mu&s;t be for the frailer Part,
which it is not my Bu&s;ine&s;s to name; and 'tis
only contrived, in a manner, le&s;s expo&s;ed to the
common Scandal of the Times; the Woman
has her wanton Ends an&s;wered, without the Re|proach
of taking a young Fellow to Bed to her,
on the Account mentioned before, and only is
content to &s;leep with an older Bedfellow, to
avoid the Scandal.</P>
<P>BUT there is a wor&s;e Ca&s;e in this &s;candalous
Matrimony yet behind, and this is on the
Man's Part; a flagrant Example of which take
as follows: <HI>A</HI>&mdash;<HI>B</HI>&mdash;, a grave Citizen,
and in the flouri&s;hing Part of his Years, though
not in his Prime, not a Youth, being about
Forty, buries his Wife; he has three or four
Children by his former Lady, and cares not to
have the Charge of any more, or, to u&s;e his
Words, would not wrong his Children, but has
<PB N="241" REF="257">
a kind of an Occa&s;ion, which &s;hall be namele&s;s,
and he mu&s;t marry.</P>
<P>TO an&s;wer both the&s;e Ends, and to join the
Wife and the Wicked together, he will, in the
abundance of his Prudentials, take a Wife that
&s;hall be &s;ure to be pa&s;s'd Children; &s;o gratify|ing
the Bea&s;t and the Chri&s;tian both at once.
Upon this, he &s;ingles out a grave motherly Wi|dow,
who he took to be about Five and fifty,
and indeed, by her Face, &s;he &s;eemed to be no
le&s;s.</P>
<P>THE Lady had as much Occa&s;ion for a Hu&s;|band
as Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash;had for a Wife; whether
it was upon the &s;ame Motive, Hi&s;tory is &s;ilent
in that Part, and &s;o am I; but, it &s;eems, &s;he
had been given to under&s;tand what Foot it was
Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash;married upon; and not being
willing to di&s;appoint him, or rather, not wil|ling
to lo&s;e him, &s;he call'd her &s;elf an old
Woman, and her Beauty concurring, admitted
what few Widows are pleas'd to &s;toop to, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
that &s;he was, as above, near Five and fifty.</P>
<P>BEING thus happily married, and Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash;wrapt
up in his Enjoyments, lo, to his great
di&s;appointment, the Lady proves with Child,
and, in the due Cour&s;e of Time, brings him
Twins, a fine Boy and Girl; and after all this,

<P>THIS unlook'd-for, unde&s;ired Fruitfulne&s;s,
moves him to enquire a little farther; and,
&s;earching the Regi&s;ter at the Birth of his Twins,
he finds, to his &s;urprize, that truly Fame, and
a cour&s;e Countenance, had wronged his Wife
about ten Years, and that, in&s;tead of being Five
and fifty, &s;he was not much above Four and
forty.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="258">
UNDER this Di&s;appointment, his Conti|nence
betrayed the Occa&s;ion of his Marriage;

by her, which, her Fortune being not extra|ordinary,
ruined the Fortunes of his fir&s;t Chil|dren,
who he pretended to have &s;o much Con|cern
for. This was the End of Matrimonial
Whoring with Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash;. And now he is
a&s;hamed to talk publickly of his own Shame,
as well the Rea&s;ons of his Marriage, as the Ma|nagement
of it, in which he has indeed this
Advantage of the Satyr, that his Di&s;coveries
are too gro&s;s to be de&s;cribed, as his Language is

<P>I meet with &s;o many of the&s;e Sorts of lewd

took the freedom to expo&s;tulate upon this Sub|ject

the following &s;hort Di&s;cour&s;e, according to the

<P>SAYS <HI>Tom,</HI> his grave Friend, to <HI>Jack,</HI> Pr'y|thee,

<P>Why, you run to every Hole and Cor|ner,

&s;ay, a Fortune-hunting too; that's wor&s;e.</P>

<P>Nay, that's fal&s;e too; I have indeed
talk'd of marrying, but not like that neither.</P>

<P>What do you mean by that? Explain
your &s;elf, what is it you drive at?</P>

is this: Money I would have, that's the fir&s;t
thing; but then I have Children enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>

you Money enough?</P>

<P>No, no. Look ye, <HI>Tom,</HI> I an't the
Man the World takes me for; I am well enough,
but I am far from rich; and I have &s;even Chil|dren,
you know; and that's enough to make a
rich Man die poor.</P>

<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't Halt before you're Lame; you
are worth Ten thou&s;and Pounds, at lea&s;t; every

<P>No, no, I an't &s;o rich; but if I was,

the Ends and Rea&s;ons of Matrimony is to pick
out a Wife, only for her Money? that is not
taking a Wife, <HI>Jack,</HI> 'tis Matrimonial Plunder,
'tis robbing a Woman, only within the Pale of

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>

I care not a Farthing whether I have much
Money with her, or no, if I like the Wo|man.</P>

<P>Well, now you &s;peak Bravely and

<P>Why not? pray.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you why not, if you are willing
to be &s;erious. You had a fine charming Lady,
almo&s;t twenty Years; &s;he brought you a good
Fortune, and has left you &s;even fine charming
Children; your two elde&s;t Daughters are fine
beautiful young Ladies, and Marriageable;
'twould look very hard to bring a Mother-in|law
among them all. It will make a &s;ad

<P>No, no; I won't turn them out of
Doors for her, neither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's a Je&s;t, you know better; you
mu&s;t turn them out of Doors, or they'll turn
her out of Doors, that you may depend upon;
and the la&s;t would be hard too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what Nece&s;&s;ity is there for either
of them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>The be&s;t An&s;wer to that, <HI>Jack,</HI> is;
what Nece&s;&s;ity can you have to marry at
all?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know; I have no Nece&s;&s;ity in|deed;
but I am alone, without a Wife: I want
One to guide my Hou&s;e, and govern the Fa|mily.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can that be? when you have two
young Ladies, Women grown, that are perfectly
fit for it, and &s;hew you, that they very well
under&s;tand it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's very true; but they won't be
always with me; they'll marry. One of them

Authority.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="248" REF="264">
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>How d'ye mean? You would not give
the Authority over your Children to a Wife;

Doors, or, as I &s;aid above, you mu&s;t give the
Children Authority over your Wife; and that
will never do; &s;o, in &s;hort, your Hou&s;e will be

the Family-Peace is gone, the Man's undone;

<P>Well, I mu&s;t venture it, I think; for
I mu&s;t have a Wife to direct Things; there
mu&s;t be Conver&s;ation and Confidence, and a|bundance
of Things which a Family requires,
that make a Wife ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Come, Cou&s;in, <HI>Jack,</HI> don't mince the

a <HI>Woman.</HI></P>

<P>I can't help that; I am to under&s;tand

<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, if it is not in your Head, 'tis
&s;omewhere el&s;e then, I tell you; no Body can,

Law is it again&s;t? pray.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Why, you force me to be &s;erious with
you, whether I will or no. I tell you, the Mar|riage
you propo&s;e, though it is not again&s;t the
expre&s;s Letter of the Law, 'tis again&s;t the in|tent
<PB N="249" REF="265">
and meaning of it; 'tis all Vice and Wick|edne&s;s,
and, I'am &s;ure, that is again&s;t the
meaning of all Law or Rule that a Chri&s;tian
ought to walk by.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>You &s;urprize me. Pray, explain your
&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, the Thing explains it &s;elf: To
marry a Wife on purpo&s;e to have no Children;
Why, any Body knows the meaning of that. I am
plain, and I explain my &s;elf thus: As to marry
her, to give your Children her Money, was a
Matrimonial Plunder; &s;o to marry her, to have
no Children at all, is a <HI>Matrimonial Lewdne&s;s;</HI>
'tis only a kind of legal Whoring, <HI>Jack,</HI> you
may call it what you will; I tell you, it's Vice,
under the Protection of the Church, as I &s;aid,
t'other was Robbery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very plain with me, that's true.
But, I tell you, there is no &s;uch Thing in my
Thoughts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, I tell you, whatever you may
per&s;uade me to, you will never make any Man
el&s;e believe it. The Notion of directing your
Hou&s;e, governing your Family, Conver&s;ing,
Confidence, and &s;uch Stuff as that; all the&s;e
are Pretences, and no more; the Thing is a
<HI>Woman,</HI> a <HI>Woman,</HI> I tell you, and nothing
el&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, if you will make it be &s;o whe|ther
I will or no, I can't help that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then take a Wife in the ordinary
Way of &s;uitable Years, like a Chri&s;tian.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, and fill the Hou&s;e again with
a new Family? No, that won't do at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, if you won't marry like a Chri|&s;tian,
then live unmarried like a Chri&s;tian.
Pr'ythee be a Chri&s;tian one Way or t'other.
<PB N="250" REF="266">
But to marry, and yet re&s;olve to make it
impo&s;&s;ible to have Children; there's nothing
of the Chri&s;tian in that; any more than you
may call your &s;elf a Chri&s;tian, and live like a
Heathen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very &s;evere, <HI>Tom;</HI> very rigid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>I love plain Dealing; I am for your
doing hone&s;tly, either one Way or t'other. If
you are in a &s;treight for a Woman, take one in
the Name of GOD, and in the Way which GOD
has appointed. But to pretend a thou&s;and
Things, and then marry with Views contrary,
and incon&s;i&s;tent with the Ordinance it &s;elf,
that's all Grimace; the vi&s;ible Occa&s;ion is
Lewdne&s;s; &s;candalous Lewdne&s;s, and you can|not
carry it off, let your Pretences be what they
will.</P>
<P>THIS Di&s;cour&s;e ended &s;oon after this. But
the Citizen was not &s;o convinced of the Ju&s;tice
of his Friend's Rea&s;oning, as to guide him to
the wi&s;er Medium, and not to marry at all:
But, on the contrary, he pur&s;ued the brutal
Part, took the Woman, gratified his gro&s;&s;er
Appetite, in &s;pite of Argument. In a word,
he committed the Matrimonial Abomination I
am &s;o ju&s;tly expo&s;ing. And he felt the Con&s;e|quences
of it many Ways: As, (1.) He de&s;troy|ed
his Con&s;titution, ruin'd his Health. (2.)
He was Bla&s;ted, as it were, from Heaven; for
he got a Woman of an unquiet furious Temper,
that hara&s;s'd him with her Tongue, made a
<HI>Bedlam</HI> of his Hou&s;e, and broke the Peace of his
Family. (3.) Endeavouring to oblige One that
knew not how to be obliged, he di&s;obliged all
his 'Children; provedan unkind Father, and that
dr$$e them from him, &s;ome one Way, &s;ome
<PB N="251" REF="267">
another; and, in a word, he ruined the whole
Comfort of his Life; and &s;uch is the Fruit of
Matrimonial Whoredom.</P>
<P>TO conclude. This is frequently the Occa&s;ion
of great Mi&s;chiefs in Families where it happens;
it creates con&s;tant Feuds, and, above all things,
Jealou&s;y, indeed it has a direct tendency to
it; 'tis as natural for an old Man to be jealous
of a young Wife, and an old Woman to be
jealous of a young Husband, as it is for People
to be afraid of Fire or Thieves, where there is
no Body left at home to look after the Hou&s;e.
Nor are &s;uch People at all beholden to the
World's Good-will. Nothing is more frequent
than for the People, by their common Di&s;|cour&s;e,
Flouts, Jeers, and Gibing, to promote
tho&s;e Jealou&s;ies, and (if the married Couple have
no more Wit) to rai&s;e and encrea&s;e them.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">of marrying with Inequality of Blood.</HEAD>
<P>_INEQUALITY <HI>of Blood:</HI> This is an
Article in Matrimony which they,
who would be thought to expect
any Felicity in a married Life,
ought very carefully to avoid, e&s;pe|cially
if it relates to Families al&s;o. How &s;can|dalou&s;ly
have I known a Lady treated in a
Family, though her Fortune has been the very
rai&s;ing, or at lea&s;t, re&s;toring the Circum&s;tances
of the Per&s;on who has taken her, only be|cau&s;e
&s;he has been beneath them in Degree?
That &s;he has not been of noble Blood, or of
what they call an antient Family; that &s;he has
not been what they call a Gentlewoman, and
yet they have not found any Defect either in
her Education or Behaviour? How has &s;he been
&s;corned by the Relations, and the Title been
hardly granted her, which the Lord of Nece&s;&s;ity
gives her? And all becau&s;e of what they call Me|chanick
Original. Again, Sir <HI>G</HI>&mdash;<HI>W</HI>&mdash;has
married a Lady out of a noble Family. Sir <HI>G</HI>&mdash;is
Ma&s;ter of a va&s;t Fortune, has about &s;even thou|&s;and
Pounds a Year E&s;tate, and Ca&s;h enough in
ready Money to purcha&s;e as much more. But,
alas! he is of no Family; his Father was a
Citizen, and purcha&s;hed a Coat of Arms with his
Money, but hardly can tell who his Grandfather
<PB N="253" REF="269">
was; and the Lady is taught to de&s;pi&s;e him at
that rate, that it is hardly reconcileable to her
Sen&s;e, that &s;he &s;hould ever entertain him in the
Quality of a Husband. It is true, that &s;he
had but a mean Fortune, <HI>viz.</HI> five thou&s;and
Pounds. What then? &s;he had much rather
have married a <HI>Scotch</HI> Nobleman, as &s;he could
have done, the Earl of&mdash;, though he had
not above a thou&s;and Pounds a Year. But then
&s;he had had a Man of Quality, and &s;he had had
a Coronet upon her Coach; &s;he had match'd
like her &s;elf, and mingled with noble Blood, as
&s;he ought to have done. But now &s;he is De|ba&s;ed
and Di&s;honoured, &s;he is levelled with the
Canail; the old Counte&s;s, her Lady-Mother,
con&s;idered nothing but the Money; and d&mdash;it,
&s;he had rather have been King <HI>Ch&mdash;</HI>'s
Whore, and then &s;he might have been a Duche&s;s,
and her Children had been Dukes of cour&s;e,
and had had noble Blood in their Veins by the
lowe&s;t degree, and royal Blood on the other
Side; whereas now, in &s;hort, &s;he looks upon
her &s;elf to be little better than Pro&s;tituted, and
that meerly for an E&s;tate.</P>
<P>WITH this Elevation of Pride, concerning
Blood and Family, &s;he treats her Husband with
the utmo&s;t Di&s;dain: She will have her Equi|page
by her &s;elf; &s;he will not &s;o much as give
his Liveries, but the Livery of her own Family;
&s;he won't have his Coat of Arms painted upon
her Coach, or engraven upon her Plate; much
le&s;s will &s;he &s;uffer her Coat of Arms to be
quartered with his, if &s;he could help it, on any
Occa&s;ion; and 'tis a great Mortification to her
that her elde&s;t Son, attach'd to his Father, and
honouring his Per&s;on, learns not to copy
after her; and is not a&s;hamed of the Blood of
<PB N="254" REF="270">
his Paternal Line, by whom he inherits &s;o fair
an E&s;tate.</P>
<P>MY Lady carries on her Re&s;entment &s;o far,
that &s;he won't vi&s;it her Husband's Si&s;ter, tho'
&s;he has married an Earl, becau&s;e &s;he di&s;dains to
rank below her; and as to all the re&s;t of Sir
<HI>G</HI>&mdash;'s Relations, they are looked upon as
not worth making a Bow to them, other than
&s;he would do to a Country Farmer, that comes
to her Lady&s;hip to pay his Rent.</P>
<P>AMONG her Intimates, &s;he laments her Mi&s;|fortune
that &s;he &s;hould be &s;o di&s;honoured in
her Match; wonders at her &s;elf, how &s;he &s;ub|mitted
to let &s;uch a Fellow come to Bed to her,
and is horridly provoked that &s;he has had any
Children; for the pre&s;ent &s;he has parted Beds
with him a great while; &s;o long, that &s;he thanks
GOD &s;he has forgot him in that relation; &s;he
made a Political Quarrel with him three Years
before, and &s;he &s;wore to him, he &s;hould have no
more to do with her that Way, &s;he would as
&s;oon lie with her Coachman; and &s;he has kept
her Vow mo&s;t &s;acred: And was it not for &s;ome
Conveniences of her Way of Living, Equi|pages,
the Man&s;ion Hou&s;e, which is new and
fine, and co&s;t fifty thou&s;and Pounds building,
and the like, &s;he would feign another Quarrel,
and &s;tep out of his Hou&s;e too, and then &s;he
&s;hould be my Lord&mdash;'s Daughter again,
not my Lady&mdash;, the Wife of a City Knight,
which is much at one to her, as if &s;he had been
Mrs.&mdash;, the Shop-keeper's Wife at <HI>Win|che&s;ter,</HI>
or Mrs. Any-Body; or e&s;pecially it had
been much more honourable to the Family, to
have been <HI>Lady Mayore&s;s;</HI> then, at lea&s;t, &s;he
had been Quality for a Year; and her good
<PB N="255" REF="271">
Man had been once <HI>a Lord,</HI> though his Father
had been <HI>the Lord knows who.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN &s;he talks to his Servants, that is to
&s;ay, tho&s;e that are his Servants too, &s;he taunts
them with &s;uch an Air of Haughtine&s;s, as if
they were Dogs, not Servants; while &s;he treats
her own Servants with a difference, as if they
were as much &s;uperior to his, as &s;he thinks &s;he
is to their Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>THE hone&s;t Gentleman her Husband, is a
Man of Sen&s;e and Breeding, and particularly
of abundance of Good-humour: He thought
at fir&s;t he &s;hould have been very happy in a
Wife, and he cho&s;e her for what he thought &s;he
had, (but &s;he had it not) namely, good Tem|per,
Sen&s;e and Sincerity. He could have bet|tered
his Fortune in a Wife, by thirty or forty
thou&s;and Pounds, whenever he had plea&s;ed;
&s;o that he neither married her for her Family,
or her Fortune. Tho' he was not a Lord, he
was able to buy a Lord when he plea&s;ed; and
as much de&s;pi&s;ed a Title, unle&s;s it had been by
Blood, or obtained by &s;pecial Merit, as &s;he a|dored
it, only for the meer Equipage of it. His
di&s;appointment in her Temper was a great Af|fliction
to him; and he did not fail to expo&s;tu|late
it with her, tho' with the utmo&s;t Civility.
But Pride had gotten the a&s;cendant &s;o much
over her Temper, that &s;he was re&s;olved to ruin
her Family-Peace, as it were, in meer revenge,
for her fal&s;e Step, as &s;he called it, in marrying
beneath her Quality; tho' &s;he really revenged
it only upon her &s;elf.</P>
<P>AGAIN; her Pride was attended with &s;uch
unhappy Circum&s;tances, that it expo&s;ed her
very much, and made her the common Je&s;t of
all the Families of Gentry, and even Nobility
<PB N="256" REF="272">
al&s;o, of which there are a great many in the
Country where &s;he lives: As I have &s;aid, that
Sir <HI>G</HI>&mdash;was a well-bred Gentleman, and a
Man of Sen&s;e, he was acceptable to every
Body; kept the be&s;t Company, and was very
well received in all Places; nor, however the
Lady acted, did the Nobility, even of the fir&s;t
Rank, think it below them, both to Conver&s;e
with him, and even to Vi&s;it him; which re|li&s;hed
&s;o ill with her Lady&s;hip, that &s;he could
hardly refrain her little Sarca&s;ms, even before
them; reflecting on Per&s;ons of Quality keeping
Company below them&s;elves, as &s;he call'd it,
and of the antient Nobility deba&s;ing their
Blood, by mingling with Mechanicks; that
their Ance&s;tors &s;corned to intermarry with the
Commonalty, and kept the Honour of their
Families entire and untainted.</P>
<P>SHE was roundly an&s;wered once, at her own
Table, by a certain noble Lord of an antient
Family, who told her.</P>
<P>MADAM, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> your Lady&s;hip very much
mi&s;takes the Ca&s;e. In former Days, the Nobi|lity
po&s;&s;e&s;s'd great E&s;tates, and had powerful
Dependencies; the Landed Intere&s;t was theirs,
and almo&s;t all the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was their own;
the Commons held under them either in Va&s;|&s;alage
or Villainage, either as Va&s;&s;als, Tenants,
Cottagers, or Servants; and then it was in|deed
beneath a Man of Quality to match a|mong
the Va&s;&s;als.</P>
<P>BUT then two Things are to be ob&s;erved,
which have happened in <HI>England</HI> &s;ince that
Time.</P>
<P>1. THE Commons have grown rich by In|du&s;try
and Commerce.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="273">
2. THE Nobility are become poor, or at
lea&s;t poorer; be it by Sloth and Luxury, I do
not determine.</P>
<P>THE Con&s;equence is this, that the Nobility
&s;ell their E&s;tates, and the Commons buy them:
And &s;o the Landed Intere&s;t is &s;eparated; and
the Commons po&s;&s;e&s;s, I believe, ten Parts of
twelve, hardly leaving the other two Parts of
twelve to the better guided Nobility.</P>
<P>THEN, Madam, of the&s;e whom we &s;till call
the Commons, great Numbers of them are of
noble Families; for the Gentry bringing their
Sons up to Indu&s;try and Trade, they have found
the Sweets of Commerce in &s;uch a manner,
that they have rai&s;ed innumerable Families
out of nothing; by which means it now is
come to pa&s;s, that many of our be&s;t Gentry are
embarked in Trade; and there are &s;ome as
good Families among the Trade&s;men, as mo&s;t,
out of that Cla&s;s; we often go into the City to
get Fortunes for our Sons; and many noble
Families, &s;unk by the Folly and Luxury of
their Predece&s;&s;ors, are re&s;tored, by marrying
into the Families of tho&s;e that you call Me|chanicks;
and, Madam, (added his Lord&s;hip)
the Children of tho&s;e Families, thus rai&s;ed by
their Merit, are not ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed from
&s;ome of the be&s;t Hou&s;es in the Kingdom.</P>
<P>HERE his Lord&s;hip thought he had plea&s;ed
the Lady, becau&s;e &s;he had three Sons, very fine
young Gentlemen, by Sir <HI>G</HI>&mdash;. But, far
from being plea&s;ed with his Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;he
could not forbear being almo&s;t rude to his
Lord&s;hip, and told him, &s;he thought the No|bility
could not Match &s;o among the Com|mons,
without corrupting their Blood; and that
tho&s;e that had done &s;o ought to be no more e|&s;teemed
<PB N="258" REF="274">
Gentlemen, or to rank among the an|tient
Families.</P>
<P>HIS Lord&s;hip &s;miled. Well, Madam, &s;ays
his Lord&s;hip, then you mu&s;t let the Trade&s;men
keep their Money too, as well as keep their
Daughters; and we &s;hall continue to decline
and become poor, by our riotous and extrava|gant
Living; and &s;o, in a few Ages more, the
Wealth of the Nation may be almo&s;t all in
the Hands of the trading Part of the People;
and the decayed Nobility may be as De&s;picable
as they may be Poor. Pray, <HI>added he,</HI> what would
all our noble Blood do for us without our E&s;tates?
And pray, Madam, &s;ays he, be plea&s;ed to look
into Things, and &s;ee how many noble Families
are, at this time, the Offspring of Trade;
we do not find, that their Po&s;terity are le&s;s va|lued
among the Nobility, or le&s;s de&s;erve it.
Two Dukes, adds his Lord&s;hip, are, at this
time, the Grand&s;ons, and one Nobleman, the
Son of Sir <HI>Jo&s;iah Child,</HI> who was but a Trade&s;|man;
and the noble Families of <HI>Exce&s;ter,</HI> of
<HI>On&s;low,</HI> of <HI>Ar</HI>&mdash;, of many more, are married
to the Daughters of Trade&s;men; and, on the
other hand, the Sons of Sir <HI>James Bateman,</HI> Sir
<HI>Thomas Scawen,</HI> and &s;everal others, are married
to the Daughters of our Nobility.</P>
<P>HIS Lord&s;hip was going on; but &s;he begg'd
him to &s;ay no more of that, fearing he would
have brought it down to her &s;elf at la&s;t; and
&s;o the Di&s;cour&s;e went off. But the Lady was
hand&s;omely reproved.</P>
<P>THESE are &s;ome of the Fruits of unequal
Marriages, and in which much of this Matri|monial
Whoredom may be committed; and I
call it &s;o, becau&s;e the &s;ubmitting to lie with a
Man, only on the Account of a Settlement or
<PB N="259" REF="275">
Fortune; at the &s;ame time de&s;pi&s;ing, and, in
the vile&s;t manner, contemning the Man; is a
meer &s;elling the Per&s;on for a Slave, or, though
the Words are &s;omething har&s;h, pro&s;tituting the
Per&s;on for the &s;ake of the Money. And what
is that more or le&s;s, according to my Notion,
than Matrimonial Whoredom?</P>
<P>The next Article is that of <HI>Un&s;uitable E&s;tates.</HI>
This is of the &s;ame Kind with the la&s;t, and, in
its Degree, is equally de&s;tructive; and there|fore
I join them together in the &s;ame Chapter;
the only Difference is, that the fir&s;t re&s;pects a
Per&s;on of Quality marrying a Mechanick, a
Patrician, or one of the Blood of the <HI>Patricii,</HI>
marrying a <HI>Plebeian:</HI> But this latter looks a
Stage lower, and re&s;pects only the Difference
of E&s;tates, where the Blood may be the &s;ame;
which Difference, however, is carried on by
&s;ome to greater Re&s;entments than among the
Nobility. This happens frequently among
Trade&s;men, and is di&s;tingui&s;hed by many
People, very much to their Di&s;advantage. Sir
<HI>M</HI>&mdash;<HI>G</HI>&mdash;was a City Baronet, that is, the
Son of a Money Baronet; he married a Lady,
the Daughter of a rich Citizen, not in the
Bloom of her Youth, far from Beautiful; but
then he had a va&s;t Fortune with her; all this
was well of his Side. But, what is &s;he? Why,
in the fir&s;t Place, bringing her to a level with
him&s;elf, &s;he has a great deal of Money, that
is true, and he has little or Nothing; he has
a great deal of good Manners, and good Hu|mour,
&s;he very little of either; he is Hand|&s;ome,
&s;he next Door to Frightful: She in&s;ults
him upon the Inequality of her Fortune. What
does he &s;ay to her in return? Has he nothing
to an&s;wer on his Side? Truly, no, not at fir&s;t.
<PB N="260" REF="276">
But being a Man of Breeding, as I &s;aid above,
he took it quietly, and was ea&s;y; gave her all
manner of Liberties, made no reply, gave her
not one ill Word; till, at length, being pro|voked
beyond all po&s;&s;ible Degrees of human
Patience, he re&s;olved to make her a terrible
Return; and, indeed, he was &s;orely provoked,
that he was. He fir&s;t begg'd of her to be ea&s;y
and quiet, and to u&s;e him better, and manage
her &s;elf better. She provoked him &s;o much
with her vile Reproaches and Reflections, up|on
his being a Beggar, as &s;he call'd it, and mak|ing
a Figure with her Money, that one Day it
broke out into a Flame that could not be
quenched. But it was his particular good For|tune
to have &s;everal of her own Friends to be
Witne&s;&s;es of the Provocation, and &s;o far to
ju&s;tify him, as, at lea&s;t, to witne&s;s in his Be|half,
that her Language was un&s;ufferable.</P>
<P>NOR is it to be wondered at, that when he
did break out, he did it with &s;uch a Fury that
conquered all her Re&s;i&s;tance, and that put a full
check to her Clamour; for it touch'd her in the
mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Part, namely, her Character as to
Mode&s;ty.</P>
<P>HE gave her this, even the very fir&s;t time,
in a full broad Side, as the Sailors call it, and
when, as I &s;ay, her own Relations were pre&s;ent.
But he did not do it, till &s;he had long and
very often provoked him, by reproaching him
with her Fortune, and his want of a Fortune,
and that with &s;o much Bitterne&s;s, that even
&s;ome of tho&s;e Relations of her's begg'd her to
forbear, and have done with it; and he, per|ceiving
that Relation inclined to &s;peak, with|drew,
to give her an Opportunity, which &s;he
improved, and earne&s;tly entreated her to for|bear;
<PB N="261" REF="277">
told her, it was now too late to reflect
upon tho&s;e Things; that they had Money e|nough
to make them both happy; and that, let
it be who&s;e it would before, it was a Stock in
common now, and &s;he &s;hould never make their
Lives unhappy now about the fooli&s;h Que&s;tion,
who brought it? She told her, &s;he might ea&s;ily
&s;ee her Husband was exceedingly moved with
what &s;he had &s;aid already; and that &s;he would
certainly provoke him by &s;uch outrageous U|&s;age,
to make her &s;ome bitter return; that &s;he
ought to con&s;ider &s;he was a Wife, and that it
is always in a Husband's Power to make a
Woman's Life unea&s;y to her, e&s;pecially when
he has Ju&s;tice on his Side.</P>
<P>SHE was &s;o far from being prevailed upon
by this calm and cool Rea&s;oning, that &s;he flew
out into a Pa&s;&s;ion again&s;t her Husband, though
he was not in the Room; reviled him over and
over with his living gay upon her Fortune,
while he was but a Beggar him&s;elf, and the like;
&s;o that the poor Lady, who had talked &s;o calm|ly
to her, had not room to put in a Word.</P>
<P>IN the highth of this Feud the Husband
came in again, and calmly de&s;ired her to have
done, and be quiet, and, at lea&s;t, to talk no
more of it then, when &s;he &s;eemed to be in a
Pa&s;&s;ion. But 'twas all one; &s;he run on till, in
a word, &s;he was out of Breath, and began to
have done, meerly for want of Strength, not
Rage. To proceed:</P>
<P>WELL, Madam, &s;ays he, now, I hope, 'tis
my turn to &s;peak a little; then, turning his
Speech to the Lady that had &s;poken in his Ab|&s;ence,
and to her other Relations, he gave them
a brief Account how long &s;he had treated him
in this Manner; how little Occa&s;ion he had
<PB N="262" REF="278">
given her for it; and with what Patience he
had born it: How ju&s;t it was for him to &s;ay,
that he could bear it no longer, and that he
was re&s;olved to u&s;e her as &s;he de&s;erved. Then,
turning to his Wi&s;e, who &s;till upbraided him with
marrying her for her Money: He &s;aid, 'tis very
true, Madam, I did &s;o; and who the Devil would
have married you for any thing el&s;e? He
added, that if &s;he would find any One to take
his Bargain off of his Hands, he would return
all the Money again, to be rid of her: And if
&s;he could not, &s;ince &s;he had taken him, and he
was unhappily bound to &s;tand to the Agreement,
he in&s;i&s;ted, &s;he &s;hould act the Part of a Wi&s;e,
not of a Termagant; of a Gentlewoman, not
a <HI>Billin&s;gate;</HI> and that, &s;ince &s;he had taken
him, let her Fortune be what it will, he ex|pected
to be u&s;ed as well, as if he had taken her
upon an equal Foot, otherwi&s;e he is &s;old to
her for a Slave, which he did not under&s;tand to
be in the Contract.</P>
<P>SHE revil'd him upon this, with his taking her
Money with de&s;ign to Abu&s;e her; he reproaches
her with giving him her Money and her Per&s;on
too, upon a wor&s;e Occa&s;ion; he tells her, he
could have lived without her Money better
than &s;he could live without a Man; that he
only hired him&s;elf out to her to be her Ser|vant,
(he called it by a harder Name) and that
he had earned all her Money by lying with
her, which a Porter would hardly have done
cheaper.</P>
<P>IT is true, this was Bitter: But there were
two Misfortunes, on her Side, attending it.</P>
<P>1. THAT &s;he extorted it from him. And,</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="279">
2. THAT it was true; both the&s;e joined to
excu&s;e the Knight, who otherwi&s;e, and as I
&s;aid, till by long and un&s;ufferable Taunts and
ill U&s;age, he was put a little out of him&s;elf,
was a Per&s;on of all po&s;&s;ible Temper and Man|ners.</P>
<P>THIS al&s;o brings it home to my Point,
namely, that the&s;e lewd ill-principled Matches
are often as Mi&s;erable as they are Scandalous,
as Unhappy as they are Un&s;eemly; and as
they begin in Wickedne&s;s, they end in Weak|ne&s;s;
for Crime and Shame follow one ano|ther.</P>
<P>I &s;hall, perhaps, be asked here, What this
Un&s;uitable and Unequal marrying relates to
my Title, and to the Subject I am upon, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
of Matrimonial Whoredom? And why I ram|ble
from my Text? But I &s;hall make it out,
that I am not gone from my Subject at all; be|cau&s;e
almo&s;t all tho&s;e Inequalities and Un&s;uit|able
Things, which I complain of as the Bane
of Matrimony, are generally the Con&s;equences
of tho&s;e Marriages, which are guided by the
Tail rather than the Head; forced on by the In|clination
rather than the Under&s;tanding,
pu&s;hed by the Impetuo&s;ity of the corrupt Part,
not guided by the &s;teddy Re&s;ults of Rea&s;on;
the Fruit of De&s;ire not Judgment, and with a
View to &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ure, not &s;olid Enjoy|ments.</P>
<P>THESE are the great Moving-Wheels in the
Machines of ra&s;h and unguided Love; the
Pa&s;&s;ion of Love, not the Quality, is the Weight
that makes them move; it is the Fuel of Love,
not the Flame; the Flame would be pure,
were the Materials that feed it pure: But
<PB N="264" REF="280">
when the Combu&s;tibles are nau&s;eous, the Burn|ing
&s;catters noxiou Vapours; like the Stink-Pots,
which the <HI>Turks</HI> u&s;ed to throw into Ships
when they Boarded them, which would poi&s;on
the poor Men out of their clo&s;e Quarters, and
make them run out, though they were &s;ure to
be killed.</P>
<P>SECRET, lewd and ungoverned De&s;res,
make the&s;e open and &s;candalous Doings &s;o fre|quent;
were it all done in a criminal Way, I
&s;hould take notice of it in Lump, as a Breach
of the Laws of GOD and Man; and, as the
Text &s;peaks, <HI>an Iniquity to be puni&s;hed by the
Judge,</HI> Job xxii. 28. But it is quite otherwi&s;e
here; the Fire is covered, the Stench is con|cealed,
and we have all the criminal filthy
Part acted under the di&s;gui&s;e of Virtue, and
the Protection of Law. This is the Offence,
this is the Grievance complained of; and this
the Rea&s;on why I give it the new and perhaps,
a little &s;hocking Title of Matrimonial Whore|dom.</P>
<P>THE
meaning is plain; 'tis a Breach of Law
under the Protection of the Law; 'tis a Crime,
thro' the Policy of Hell, plac'd out of the reach of
Ju&s;tice; 'tis a Sin again&s;t the meaning of Ma|trimony,
but within the Letter of it; 'tis a
Wickedne&s;s couch'd under the Name of Virtue;
'tis, in &s;hort, a Devil in Ma&s;querade, whoring
in the Vizor of Matrimony; a Sinner dre&s;s'd up
for a Saint, a foul Di&s;ea&s;e under the Term of a
Decay; 'tis Idolatry under the Cover of true
Wor&s;hip, and, as I &s;aid above, Lewdne&s;s under
the Protection of the Church.</P>
<P>WHAT Excu&s;e can it be to &s;ay, that the Law
cannot reach it? Are there not many Sins which
the Commands of GOD prohibits and forbids,
<PB N="265" REF="281">
which, notwith&s;tanding no Law can puni&s;h?
And are they le&s;s Criminal for that, or the
more? The Laws of the Land puni&s;h no Man
for Avarice, yet Covetou&s;ne&s;s is expre&s;sly for|bid
in the Scripture; and the Love of Money
is called the Root of all Evil. The Laws of
the Land take no notice of our Anger, Pa&s;&s;ion,
Fighting, Gluttony, Exce&s;s of Drink, and &s;e|veral
other Things, except Murther, Breach of
the Peace, Drunkenne&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are the Con&s;e|quences.
You may eat till you gorge your
Stomach, and de&s;troy your Life; you may SIP,
and WHET, and doze Nature, till it expires in
a Lethargick Soti&s;me; you may Rage, Storm,
and make your Hou&s;e a Hell, and the Law
takes no Cogni&s;ance of you. But no Man will
&s;ay, they are not all dete&s;table and abhorred
Crimes for all this; unbecoming a Man of
Sen&s;e, and incon&s;i&s;tent with a Man of Reli|gion.</P>
<P>THUS,
in the Ca&s;e before us, the Law is &s;i|lent,
and the Sinner &s;afe, provided you do but
marry. Let the Foundation of it be what it
will, let the Rea&s;on of it be all as gro&s;s and
corrupt as Hell; the Motive all Sulphur and
Salt, the Views as vitious and filthy as Words
can expre&s;s; that's all to be an&s;wered for &s;ome|where
el&s;e, and you take it upon your &s;elves,
&s;o you do but marry; the Law, like <HI>Gallio,</HI> the
Deputy of <HI>Achaia, cares for none of the&s;e
Things,</HI> Acts xviii. 17.</P>
<P>BUT, are they the le&s;s Criminal? Is the
lewd Part le&s;s offen&s;ive? Is the Soul le&s;s cor|rupted?
Is the Man le&s;s debauched? Not at all;
but rather the more: Nay, the Devil, I make
no que&s;tion, as he has infinitely more Advan|tage
to prompt, fails not to make u&s;e of the
<PB N="266" REF="282">
Advantage, for he's no Fool: I'll an&s;wer for
<HI>Satan</HI> &s;o far, he can hardly be ever charg'd with
mi&s;&s;ing his Opportunities, or not &s;eeing his
Times and Sea&s;ons; he never fails to break in
at every weak Place, and always knows where
tho&s;e weak Places are.</P>
<P>WE cannot doubt but the Devil, if you will
grant there is &s;uch a Thing, takes all the Advan|tage
that can be of this Part; he &s;hews the Law
protecting; and per&s;uades you, that 'tis therefore
ju&s;tifying the Fact, a Fallacy as black as him&s;elf;
he prompts the vitious Appetite, and then
&s;hews you how 'tis lawful to gratify it; he
quotes <HI>Dryden</HI> upon you, and &s;hews the Ca&s;e
of King <HI>David,</HI> and the Polygami&s;ts, for a
Parallel.</P>
<P>What can be &s;ore &s;pecious, what more ea&s;ily
gilded over? Inclination calls for it, and the
Law allows it. Under this Pretence, all the
criminal Things which the Marriage-Bed is
capable of, are ju&s;tified.</P>
<P>BUT was the true intent and meaning of
the Laws of GOD or Man impartially judged
of, or enquired into, the Ca&s;e would be quite
otherwi&s;e. GOD, <HI>forbid,</HI> we &s;hould dare to
&s;ay, that the In&s;titution of Matrimony, which
was Pure, as the In&s;titutor was Holy, could be
de&s;igned for a Pandor to our impure and corrupt
Inclinations! or that GOD's holy Ordinance can
be made a Plea for any of our unholy and vi|tious
Practices; and, above all, that they &s;hould
be made a Cover and Protection for them.</P>
<P>ALL the Heats and Fires, rais'd within us by
the Acrimony of the Blood, by the Inflamation
of the Spirits and Animal Salts, are kindled
from Hell, &s;et on Fire by the Devil, and made
to rage and boil up in the Veins, by the in|flaming
<PB N="267" REF="283">
vitiated Thoughts and Imagination,
that Imagination which GOD him&s;elf &s;ays is
Evil, and only Evil, and that continually;
and whatever the Ju&s;t and &s;erious Rea&s;onings are
which we &s;hould u&s;e upon this, and the Con&s;e|quences
we &s;hould draw; &s;urely they are not that
we &s;hould apply our &s;elves to quench this Fire
in the Lakes of <HI>Sodom,</HI> (I do not mean literally
as to <HI>Sodom</HI>) that we &s;hould &s;tudy Ways to
&s;atiate and gratify tho&s;e impure De&s;ires; and
then finding &s;ome artful Method, give a loo&s;e
to our Appetite under the Cover of a legal
Protection, &s;heltering our Wickedne&s;s under the
Letter of the Law.</P>
<P>ON the other hand; if I was to enter into
the Affirmative or Po&s;itive Part, and tell you
what you ought to do, I &s;hould &s;ay, the&s;e are
the Deeds of the Body, which you &s;hould mor|tify,
if you will expect to live, <HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 4.
the <HI>Thorns in the Fle&s;h,</HI> which you &s;hould pray
again&s;t, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> xii. 7. the Enemies you &s;hould
&s;truggle with; and this is what the Scripture
means, when it &s;peaks of our <HI>crucifying the
Fle&s;h, with its Affections and Lu&s;ts,</HI> Gal. v. 24.
But I mu&s;t not Preach. To talk Scripture to
a Man when he has a Woman in his Head, is
talking Go&s;pel to a Kettle Drum; the Noi&s;e is
too great; the Clamour of his Vices is too
loud; and he will an&s;wer coldly, as the Wi&s;e
Men of <HI>Athens</HI> an&s;wered St. <HI>Paul, We will hear
thee again of this Matter,</HI> Acts xxvii. 32. or to
put it into a kind of a Paraphra&s;e; We will
hear thee again, &s;ome time or other, when we
have nothing el&s;e to do.</P>
<P>I come therefore to &s;earch the Crime, and
fully to expo&s;e it. Your own Rea&s;on, and, if
you have any, your Religion, will in&s;truct you
<PB N="268" REF="284">
to reform it. The&s;e un&s;uitable Matches are
generally derived from the&s;e corrupt and de|praved
Principles; and the&s;e vile Appetites are
the Things that carry us on to break into all
Rules, Religious and Moral, in the pur&s;uit of
Women.</P>
<P>WHEN the Appetite governs the Man, he
breaks all the Fences, and leaps over all the
Bars that Rea&s;on and Religion have fixed in
his Way; and if he can but ju&s;tify him&s;elf, by
pretence of keeping within the Bounds of the
Law, tho' it be only the Letter of it, he trou|bles
not him&s;elf with the intent and meaning
of it.</P>
<P>HENCE all the Matrimonial Inequalities,
the marrying at un&s;uitable Years, with un&s;uit|able
Fortunes, and all the indecent and ridi|culous,
not ince&s;tuous, Matches, which we &s;ee
daily among us; &s;o that to &s;peak of un&s;uitable
Matches, is far from being out of the Way of
my Bu&s;ine&s;s, or remote from my Subject; they
are, generally &s;peaking, from the &s;ame impure
and corrupt Originals, impure Streams, from
the &s;ame poi&s;oned and corrupted Fountain.</P>
<P>THE Man is eager, urged by the Importu|nities
of his vitiated Appetite; his Head is full
of it; he runs from Place to Place to find an
Object. To &s;ay his Eyes are blinded with the
Fumes and Vapours of his fermented Blood, is
to &s;peak according to Nature, it cannot be
otherwi&s;e; as we &s;ay Love is blind, and &s;ees
no Faults, &s;o 'tis undoubted, the Pa&s;&s;ion is blind,
the Rage of the Appetite blinds the Eyes, and
he is not capable of &s;eeing even the Defects of
Nature, much le&s;s to di&s;tingui&s;h the un&s;uitable|ne&s;s
of Objects, and the inequalities of Cir|cum&s;tances;
he is &s;till farther off from &s;eeing
<PB N="269" REF="285">
the Defects of the Mind, the Un&s;uitablene&s;s
of the &s;uperiour Parts; 'tis all out of his
Way.</P>
<P>AS 'tis in the more vitious Part Men often
abandon hand&s;ome and beautiful Ladies, their
lawful Wives, and take up with the foule&s;t,
uglie&s;t, and mo&s;t di&s;agreeable Creatures, to
make their Whores; &s;o in this Humour of
marrying, meerly to quench De&s;ire, the Vapour
darkens the Eyes, the Vice clouds the Sight,
the Man or Woman takes what Offers, making
no Judgment, no Di&s;tinction of worthy or
unworthy, &s;uitable or un&s;uitable, young or
old; 'tis the Sexes that are only concerned;
'tis the Fire that is to be quench'd; neither
Rea&s;on, Religion or Reputation, are hardly
allowed to give a Vote in the Ca&s;e, nay, &s;ome|times
common Sen&s;e: And, in this Heat, I &s;ay,
mo&s;t of the unequal un&s;uitable Marriages are
made; and, what is it all? what can it be
called? Is this Matrimony! Is this being join'd
together according to GOD'S holy Ordinance,
or is it Whoring under the Mask of the holy
Ordinance! Is this a cha&s;te and honourable
Marriage! Is this the <HI>Bed unde&s;iled,</HI> or is it ra|ther
a meer Matrimonial Whoredom!</P>
<P>I might include in this &s;ame Chapter, the
un&s;uitable Tempers which often come toge|ther
on &s;uch Occa&s;ion; but as it is true, that
this is a thing not always to be avoided, and is
what too frequently happens in Marriages made
with the utmo&s;t Con&s;ideration; &s;o I &s;hall con|vince
the Reader that I am careful not to run
from the Subject in hand, by pa&s;&s;ing it over
as a thing out of my Way at pre&s;ent. It is not
always po&s;&s;ible fully to di&s;cover the Tempers
and Di&s;po&s;itions of one another before Marri|age;
<PB N="270" REF="286">
and they that make the faire&s;t and mo&s;t
diligent Inquiry, &s;hould fir&s;t be &s;ure they
know, and regulate their own Tempers, that
the Fault be not at home while they lay it
upon their Relatives. But this would require a
long Di&s;cour&s;e; I have not room for it
here.</P>
<P>UNSUITABLE Principles in Religion would
al&s;o come in here. But, I think, the People
I am de&s;cribing need not quarrel much about
that; for all Principles, all Religion, &s;eems to
be burnt up in the impure Flame, and there|fore
all Care and Concern about them dies with
it: How &s;hould that Man be &s;uppo&s;ed to think
of Religion, who, in &s;pight of Rea&s;oning, and
in a perfect neglect of a Family of &s;even
Children, could plead Nece&s;&s;ity of having a
Wife; make a thou&s;and Shifts to turn off the
&s;candalous Part, and yet in&s;i&s;t upon having
&s;uch a Wife as &s;hould bring him no Children;
that he might &s;atiate his Gu&s;t of Sen&s;uality
without the incumbrance of Procreation; con|tract
Marriage with a Bar only to the original
Rea&s;on of Marriage, and enjoy his corrupt
Plea&s;ures under the di&s;gui&s;e of GOD'S holy Or|dinance.
Could this Man be &s;uppo&s;ed to con&s;i|der
the Un&s;uitablene&s;s or Inequality of any
thing, much le&s;s the Temper or the Principles
of the Woman he married.</P>
<P>AND the Con&s;equence made it appear; for
happening to marry a Woman that had neither
good Temper, or good Principles, he ruined the
Peace of his Family, di&s;per&s;ed and di&s;obliged
his Children, thru&s;t them out of his immediate
Care, and left their Education and In&s;truction
to other Relations; in a word, he robb'd him|&s;elf
<PB N="271" REF="287">
of the Comfort of his Children, and his
Children of the Comfort of a Father.</P>
<P>AND where was the Religion of all this?
In &s;hort, what of Matrimony was in it all?
what was it but, as I &s;aid before, a poi&s;oned
Stream from a corrupted Fountain, a di&s;hone&s;t
Flame quenched in a di&s;hone&s;t Manner? And
it can be no otherwi&s;e, where the Soul is go|verned
by the Body, where the &s;piritual Part
is over-ruled by the fle&s;hly, where the &s;en&s;ual
directs the rational, as is the Ca&s;e here ex|actly;
I &s;ay, it can be no otherwi&s;e. The
Order of Things is inverted; Nature is &s;et
with her Bottom upward; Heaven is out of
the Mind, and Hell &s;eems to have taken Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<L>Nature inverted; the Infernal Fires</L>
<L>Burn inward, raging in corrupt De&s;ires:</L>
<L>Such as the &s;ulph'rous Lake from whence they came,</L>
<L>Alike the Fuel, and alike the Flame.</L>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of going to Bed under &s;olemn Promi&s;es of
MARRIAGE, and although tho&s;e Pro|mi&s;es
are after-wards performed; and of
the Scandal of a Man's making a Whore
of his own Wife.</HEAD>
<P>_I Have dwelt upon the Inequalities
of Matrimony the longer, becau&s;e
of their Variety. I come now to
&s;ingle Ca&s;es again, and I &s;hall
di&s;patch them in &s;ingle Sections
as I go. I have now before me a
very particular Ca&s;e, in which Marriage is
made a healing or protection to a &s;candalous
Crime. Promi&s;e of Marriage is Marriage in
the Ab&s;tract, &s;ay our Advocates for Lewd|ne&s;s;
and therefore for the Parties to lie toge|ther
is no Sin, provided they &s;incerely intend
to marry afterwards, and faithfully perform
it.</P>
<P>THIS is, in &s;hort, a &s;candalous Defence of
a &s;candalous Offence; 'tis the weake&s;t Way of
arguing that any Point of &s;uch Moment was
ever &s;upported by. It is &s;o far from covering
the Offence again&s;t GOD, that it does not re|compence
the Per&s;onal Injury done to Man. I
<PB N="273" REF="289">
have hinted at it already in the Chapter;
and given you there the Opinion of the be&s;t
of Men, and particularly the Cen&s;ure of the
Prote&s;tant Churches upon it, in which, as I
&s;aid, they are more &s;trict, and puni&s;h with
more Severity, than in Ca&s;es of &s;imple Forni|cation.</P>
<P>IT may be true, that Promi&s;e of Marriage
is Marriage, but it is not marrying; it may be
called Marriage, or rather a Species of Mar|riage;
and therefore our Law will oblige &s;uch
Per&s;ons to marry afterwards as well in Ca&s;es
where they have not con&s;ummated the Agree|ment,
as where they have; and will give Da|mages,
and that very con&s;iderable, in propor|tion
to the Circum&s;tances of the Parties, where
the&s;e Promi&s;es are broken; e&s;pecially where
the Per&s;on makes the Breach, by marrying
another purely in Contravention of tho&s;e
Promi&s;es. And this is all the Remedy the in|jured
Per&s;on can obtain.</P>
<P>ALSO &s;uch a Promi&s;e, e&s;pecially if made
before Witne&s;s, will be, and frequently is ad|mitted
as a lawful Ob&s;tacle or Impediment,
why a Per&s;on under &s;uch an Obligation &s;hould
not be allowed to marry any other; nay far|ther,
the Per&s;on claiming by Virtue of &s;uch a
Promi&s;e, may forbid <HI>the Bans,</HI> as we call it; or
may &s;tand forth, and &s;hew it as a Cau&s;e, even
at the very Book, why the two Per&s;ons coming
to the Book may not be lawfully joined toge|ther;
and the Mini&s;ter cannot proceed, if &s;uch
a Cau&s;e is declared, till the Matter is decided
before the proper Judges of &s;uch Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>BUT all this does not reach the Ca&s;e pro|pos'd
at all; for were Promi&s;es of Marriage thus
allowed, and lying together upon &s;uch Promi&s;es
<PB N="274" REF="290">
lawful, you would have no more Occa&s;ion of a
fair and formal E&s;pou&s;al, and we &s;hould have
very little open Marrying among us. And
what Confu&s;ion would this make in the
World? How would the &s;acred Obligations of
Marriage be enforced, Claim of Inheritances
&s;ecur'd, Legitimacy of Children clear'd up, and
Obligation of Maintenance be pre&s;erv'd? How
and where would the&s;e Promi&s;es be recorded,
when denied and revoked? How would they
be brought into Evidence, and the Offender
again&s;t them be convicted? In a word, what
Confu&s;ion would &s;uch loo&s;e coming together
make in Families, and in Succe&s;&s;ions, in divi|ding
the Patrimonies and Effects of Inte&s;tate
Parents; and on many other Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>OUR Laws have therefore carefully provided,
that Marriages &s;hould not be e&s;teemed fair and
legal, if not performed in a fair and open Man|ner,
by a Per&s;on legally qualified to perform
the Ceremony, and appointed to it by Office;
and the Government is always concerned and
careful to puni&s;h any Defect, in the Peform|ance
even of tho&s;e qualified Per&s;ons, when
they connive at any Breach upon the In&s;titution
in the Office of Matrimony; &s;uch as marrying
People clande&s;tinely, in improper Places, at un|&s;ea&s;onable
Times, and without the apparent
Con&s;ent of Parties; and though the Law is
very tender with re&s;pect to making &s;uch Mar|riages
void, yet they are much the more &s;evere
in fixing a Puni&s;hment upon the Per&s;on that
officiates, in order, if po&s;&s;ible, to prevent all
clande&s;tine and unlawful Matches.</P>
<P>THE Law then requiring an open and formal
coming together, as a ju&s;t Recognition and Ex|ecution
of all previous and private Engage|ments,
<PB N="275" REF="291">
and refu&s;ing to legitimate tho&s;e En|gagements,
however &s;olemn, and however at|te&s;ted,
&s;o as to admit them to pa&s;s for a real
and legal Marriage; at the &s;ame time forbid|ding
all Con&s;ummation of &s;uch Agreements, till
the open and appointed Form of Marriage,
&s;ettled by the Legi&s;lature, is &s;ubmitted to, and
mutually per&s;ormed. All coming together of
the Man and Woman, upon the Foot of &s;uch
private Engagements, Promi&s;es or Contracts, is
thereby declared unlawful, and is certainly &s;inful;
'tis no Marriage; the Children are Ba&s;tards; the
Man and Woman are guilty of Fornication;
the Woman, let her Quality be what it will,
is no better or other than a W&mdash;, and the
Man a&mdash;; <HI>what you plea&s;e to call him.</HI></P>
<P>BUT now, notwith&s;tanding all this, we have
an Excu&s;e ready, which is, it &s;eems, growing
Popular; at lea&s;t, it is calculated for abate|ment
of the Cen&s;ure, and alleviating the Crime
or the Guilt, and con&s;equently it is calculated
to legitimate the Practice al&s;o; that is to &s;ay;
they allow it is not &s;trictly legal; 'tis not a full
Compliance with the Laws of the Land, and
therefore they comply with that Part, and
marry afterwards.</P>
<P>IT may be &s;uppo&s;ed, the Advocates for this
Practice have ranged over all the Prote&s;tant or
even Chri&s;tian Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> to find out
&s;ome Allowance for this Wickedne&s;s in the
Practice of any other Country; and I have
traced them in the Enquiry, and can te&s;tify,
that they have but one little Corner of <HI>Europe</HI>
to fix it in, and that is, our little diminutive
would-be-Kingdom, called, <HI>The I&s;le of Man.</HI>
And here Mr. <HI>Cambden</HI> tells us, it is a Cu&s;tom,
or rather was a Cu&s;tom, that if a Woman be
<PB N="276" REF="292">
with Child, and the proper Father of the Child
marries the Woman within two Years after its
Birth, the Child &s;hall be legitimate.</P>
<P>NOW &s;uppo&s;ing this to be &s;o; 'tis to be ob|&s;erved,</P>
<P>1. THAT this was nothing but a Cu&s;tom, in
favour of the poor innocent Child, who&s;e Hard|&s;hip
was great, in &s;uffering the Reproach of a
Crime it was no Way concern'd in.</P>
<P>2. THAT this was only a Cu&s;tom in that
barbarous Corner, and before the People there
had received the Chri&s;tian Religion, or were ci|vilized
under a regular Government.</P>
<P>3. THAT it is not allowed &s;o at this time,
&s;ince the Chri&s;tian Religion is received, and
have been reformed, no not in that Country.</P>
<P>THE Advocates for it are therefore beaten
from all their Defences; and they can find the
Practice no where ju&s;tified, no where continued.
All they have left for it now is, that they will
not have it be Criminal in the Sight of Hea|ven,
no Breach upon Con&s;cience; in a word,
no Sin; And if this can be obtained, the Prac|tice
has but one Ob&s;truction more to remove,
in order to make it general, and that is, the
ri&s;que the Woman runs, from the Weakne&s;s of
the Obligation of Honour, and from the Men's
making light of the Promi&s;e, after they have
obtained the favour on her Side.</P>
<P>HENCE it &s;eems the &s;tronge&s;t tye upon
Modern Virtue, is the regard to Safety; and
the Women pay a greater Homage to that Se|$$rity
than to the Duty; to their Intere&s;t than
to their Virtue; to their Alimony than to their
Con&s;cience; and to their Pro&s;perity than to
<PB N="277" REF="293">
their Po&s;terity. Let us &s;tate this Ca&s;e a little
clearer than it &s;eems to &s;tand in your pre&s;ent
View, and &s;ee if we can bring the World to
have a right Notion of it; for at pre&s;ent, I
think, the generality of Mankind are greatly
mi&s;taken about it.</P>
<P>1. THE Obligation we are all under to the
Laws of GOD, is a Foundation-Principle, every
Chri&s;tian mu&s;t allow it; and that we ought not
to commit any Crime again&s;t Heaven, that is,
not to do any thing which he has forbidden.
He that denies Principles is not to be di&s;puted
with; and therefore I lay this down as a Fun|damental,
a Maxim, which, without begging
the Que&s;tion, I may take for granted, while I
live among Chri&s;tians, and am talking to &s;uch.</P>
<P>2. THE Obligation we are under to the
Laws of the Country, under who&s;e Government
and Protection we live, is a rational Deduction
from, and is commanded by the Laws of GOD,
<HI>viz. to be &s;ubject to the higher Powers,</HI> and in all
Things lawful to &s;ubmit to Governours.</P>
<P>3. THE Obligation we are under to our own
Character, and the regard to Reputation, are
undi&s;puted; and we ought to do <HI>what is of good
Report,</HI> &s;eeing a good Name is better than
Life.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e three e&s;tabli&s;h the Rules of Mar|riage
to be not only lawfully impo&s;ed, but ab&s;o|lutely
nece&s;&s;ary; and that they ought to be ex|actly
complied with: And all of them make it
Criminal for any Per&s;ons, that is to &s;ay, Man and
Woman, to lie togethor before; they are legally
married.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="294">
HAVING laid this down as &s;ettled and
&s;lated Preliminary; it then follows, that no
pre-exi&s;ting Engagement or Promi&s;e between
the Man and Woman, no, nor any &s;ub&s;equent
Performance of the Promi&s;e, can be &s;ub&s;tituted
in the room of Marriage, or make the coming
together (which is &s;o, as above, forbidden) be
lawful or ju&s;tifiable.</P>
<P>NOR can any &s;ub&s;equent Performance, I &s;ay,
take off the Crime or Scandal of what is pa&s;t.
It is true, a &s;ub&s;equent Marriage makes it
lawful for them to come together afterward, be|cau&s;e
it is not indeed unlawful for &s;uch to
marry. It is not unlaw&s;ul for a Man to make
his Whore his Wife, however fooli&s;h; but it is
unlawful for any Man to make his Wife his
Whore, however &s;eemingly and intentionally
Hone&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT the Promi&s;e, &s;ay they, makes the Wo|man
his Wife. I grant it does &s;o indeed, in
Point of Right, but the Form alone gives the
legal Po&s;&s;e&s;e&s;tion. Signing a Writing, and depc|&s;iting
an Earne&s;t, or part of the Money, gives
a Man a Right to the E&s;tate he has thus pur|cha&s;ed,
and he may fairly be &s;aid to have bought
the E&s;tate; but he mu&s;t have the Deeds fairly
executed, &s;ign'd, &s;eal'd and delivered, and Livery
and Sei&s;in given in Form, before he can reccive
the Rents, and before he can take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
the Land, or the Tenants own him for their
Landlord.</P>
<P>UNDER the old <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> In&s;titution, which, it
mu&s;t be allowed, was critically ju&s;t in every
Part, being in&s;tituted immediately from Hea|ven,
a Woman betrothed or e&s;pou&s;ed to a Man,
was called his Wife, yet he never <HI>knew her</HI> till
<PB N="279" REF="295">
&s;he was openly and lawfully married; that is,
till he took her in Form.</P>
<P>THE Virgin. <HI>Mary</HI> was e&s;pou&s;ed to <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI>
but &s;he was not married, or, as the Word is,
there u&s;ed, he had not <HI>taken her to him;</HI> yet &s;he
is called his Wife, and he is called her Husband,
<HI>Matth.</HI> i. 15. his Mother <HI>Mary</HI> was <HI>e&s;pou&s;ed</HI>&mdash;But
<HI>before they came together&mdash;&s;he was found

her Husband, ver. 19. <HI>Jo&s;eph her Husband be|ing
a ju&s;t Man</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>AGAIN, ver. 20. <HI>The Angel of the</HI> LORD
<HI>appeared</HI> to Jo&s;eph <HI>in a Dream, &s;aying, Fear not

ver. 24. <HI>He did as the Angel of the</HI> LORD <HI>had
bidden him, and took unto him his Wife.</HI></P>
<P>THUS the E&s;pou&s;al made the Woman a
Wife. But they were not allowed to come to|gether,
until the publick Ceremony of <HI>taking
her to him;</HI> which publick Ceremonies al&s;o are
to be &s;een at large in the <HI>Rites and Ceremonies of
the Jewi&s;h Church. Vid.</HI> Dr. <HI>Godwin.</HI></P>
<P>IN like manner, a Man and a Woman en|gaged
by Promi&s;e, are Man and Wife, <HI>in foro
Con&s;cienti$;</HI> but they are not legally Man and
Wife, till they are legally and publickly mar|ried
in due Form, as the Law requires.</P>
<P>ALL this Preliminary is made needful by the
wicked Pretence of being Man and Wife, as
they call it, in the Sight of GOD, which is a
Mi&s;take: They really are not Man and Wife
in the Sight of GOD, any other than as e|&s;pou&s;ed;
&s;o indeed they are and cannot be law|fully
&s;eparated, much le&s;s joined to any other
Per&s;on, but they are not effectual Man and
Wife in the Sight of GOD, till they are &s;o al&s;o
in the Sight of Man; till the Publick Marriage,
<PB N="280" REF="296">
<HI>which is a Part of the Ordinance it &s;elf,</HI> is per|formed,
whereby the E&s;pou&s;als are recognized,
and the Law &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>AND what is this Promi&s;e they generally
&s;peak of in &s;uch Ca&s;es? Is it not expre&s;sly &s;o
made, and do they not call it, <HI>a Promi&s;e of Mar|riage?</HI>
Is not the Woman's Excu&s;e or Plea de|livered
always in tho&s;e very Words, <HI>He pro|mi&s;ed
to marry me;</HI> at lea&s;t the&s;e are the Pro|mi&s;es
we mean, and that I am now &s;peaking
of. As to tho&s;e wicked Promi&s;es between two,
&s;o to take one another, and to live as Man and
Wife without the Ceremony, it may be called
an Agreement, but it is not a Promi&s;e of Mar|riage,
and &s;o does not relate to our pre&s;ent Di&s;|cour&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT
now, to bring it down to the Ca&s;e in
hand. Suppo&s;e here are two young People, a
Man and Woman, they treat of Marriage, the
Woman agrees, and the Man &s;olemnly pro|mi&s;es
to marry her: But, in the mean time,
the Fellow (Hell prompting, and his own
Wickedne&s;s tempting) pre&s;&s;es this Woman to
let him lie with her. His Arguments are &s;mooth
and &s;ubtle; <HI>Why &s;hould you refu&s;e?</HI> &s;ays he: <HI>We
are fairly Man and Wife already</HI> by Agreement,
(and, in the Sight of GOD, the Intention is the
&s;ame thing as the Action) <HI>there is nothing more
to be done</HI> but <HI>ju&s;t a few Words of the Par&s;on, and
the formality of repeating it in the Church, and
that we will do too as &s;oon as I can get the Licence
down,</HI> (&s;uppo&s;e it to be in the Country) or as
&s;oon as the Asking in the Church is over; and
you may take my Word, for I a&s;&s;ure you again,
<HI>I will be very hone&s;t to you,</HI> (and then perhaps he
&s;wears to it) and <HI>How can you refu&s;e me? And
then be ki&s;&s;es her,</HI> and continues urging and
<PB N="281" REF="297">
teazing her, and wheadling her to it, and perhaps
&s;he as much inclined to it as he, only moro
for waiting till Marriage than he; &s;o that the
Devil takes hold of Inclination on both Sides,
to bring about the Wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>UPON the&s;e Pre&s;&s;ings and Importunings, at
la&s;t he prevails, and &s;he complies. And what
is this to be called? The Woman will not allow
her &s;elf to be a <HI>Whore,</HI> no, by no means: Tho
Man declares 'tis no Whoredom, he &s;corns the
Thoughts of it; he abhors it. He promi&s;ed to
marry her, and he performed it, and they were
married afterwards. He did lie with her indeed,
and &s;he was with Child fir&s;t. But what then?
they were married before the Child was born;
&s;o that the Child was born in Wedlock; &s;o
that there's no harm done in all that.</P>
<P>BUT all this is wrong; 'tis all vile and abo|minable:
'Tis not only Whoring, but 'tis wor&s;e
than Whoring, or, if you plea&s;e, the wor&s;t
kind of Whoring, and that many Ways.</P>
<P>1. ON the Man's Part; here is a publick Con|fe&s;&s;ion,
that you had a wicked filthy ungo|vernable
Inclination, that could not contain
your &s;elf from a Woman for a few Days, but
mu&s;t gratify your Appetite at the expence of
Mode&s;ty, Hone&s;ty, Ju&s;tice to your Wife, Ju&s;tice
to your own Reputation, Ju&s;tice to the Child
to be born, and be&s;ides all, a Breach of the
Laws both of GOD and Man. How &s;candalous
a Piece of Conduct is it? How Bruti&s;h, unlike
a Man, and unlike a Chri&s;tian? And all this
under a Circum&s;tance &s;o ea&s;ily complied with,
under an apparent A greement for Marriage, and
even while the Preparations are making perhaps
on both Sides.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="298">
2. ON the Woman's Part; to &s;ay nothing of
the vitious and Bea&s;tly Part, and her want of
Mode&s;ty, in re&s;pect only to her Sex; yet be|&s;ides
all that, here is a Te&s;timony of mo&s;t egre|gious
Folly; a perfect neglect of her own Vir|tue,
and of her Reputation: A bandoning the fir&s;t
to gratify the Man, and ri&s;quing the la&s;t on
a bare verbal Promi&s;e, which it is not only
po&s;&s;ible he may break, and probable he will
break, but highly improbable that he &s;hould
not; nay, according to the Cu&s;tom of Men,
according to the profe&s;s'd Notion, and the com|mon
Language of the Town, &s;he ought never
to expect the performance of &s;uch a Promi&s;e.
He's a Rogue, &s;ay they, that gets a Woman
with Child before Marriage; and he's a Fool
that marries her afterwards: He's a Knave
that promi&s;es to marry her; but he's a Fool
that performs it.</P>
<P>3. TO return to the Man's Part. How ab&s;urd
a Thing is it to make a Whore of his own Wife;
to expo&s;e her for a Whore, who he propo&s;es to
embrace as an hone&s;t Woman ever after; to
draw her in to be expo&s;ed, to be flouted at, to
be je&s;ted with, and in&s;ulted all her Days, to be
the &s;corn of her Neighbours, &s;lighted and
&s;hunned by mode&s;t Women, and laughed at by
every Body; and all this to gratify a pre&s;ent
Gu&s;t of vitious De&s;ire, which, in a few Days,
would be &s;atisfied without the hazard of Repu|tation,
without Reproach, and without Re|proof?
How ridiculous does it make the Man,
and how a&s;hamed is he afterwards to think of
it, even as long as he lives? And it may be,
that very Child born, the Product of this <HI>Matri|monial
Whoredom,</HI> &s;hall live to upbraid his own
<PB N="283" REF="299">
Father with it, or perhaps do the &s;ame, and
ju&s;tify it by his Father's Example.</P>
<P>4. AGAIN, to &s;peak of it as to the Woman's
Part. How ra&s;h, how incon&s;iderate? To expo&s;e
her &s;elf to the Reproach of being <HI>a Whore,</HI>
whereas, in a few Days, &s;he might have gratify'd
both her &s;elf, and her Husband too, without any
Scandal to her Character. Now &s;he expo&s;es her
&s;elf, not only to the Reproach of all her Neigh|bours,
but to the Contempt of the Virtuous, and to
the Je&s;t of the Mob; and, which is more than all
the re&s;t, 'tis ten to one but her Husband him|&s;elf
comes to upbraid her with it, and, perhaps,
hate her for it; at lea&s;t he will be always telling
her, how hone&s;t he was to perform &s;uch a Pro|mi&s;e,
which no Body but him&s;elf would have
made good, and no Body but a Fool, that is to
&s;ay, no Body but her, would have tru&s;ted to;
and indeed, though 'tis ungenerous and unju&s;t
in him to treat her in that Manner, yet 'tis
what &s;he has a great deal of Rea&s;on to expect,
and what &s;he really de&s;erves by her Con|duct.</P>
<P><HI>R</HI>&mdash;<HI>H</HI>&mdash;, is a North Country Laird,
which is a Title there not beneath a Man of
Quality; the Lady had, it &s;eems, made a Slip
in his favour before Marriage, of what kind you
may gue&s;s: However, he healed up the &s;ore,
and married her afterwards; &s;o his Character,
as an hone&s;t Man, was &s;aved al&s;o. But how
far'd it with the Lady?</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t Place, as he carried it but very in|differently
to her as to Kindne&s;s, &s;o he never failed
to upbraid her with his extraordinary Hone&s;ty in
taking her; how ju&s;t he was, and how infinitely
obliged &s;he ought to think &s;he was to him;
<PB N="284" REF="300">
that it was what no Body but he would have
done: And if he took any thing ill from her,
though it was twenty Years after, he would not
fail to tell her, &s;he was <HI>Ingrate;</HI> that &s;he ow'd
him a Debt &s;he could never pay; and &s;o run
back the whole Story upon her; and how, if he
had not been hone&s;ter than &s;he was, he had
never taken her, and then &s;he had been un|done.</P>
<P>2. TO make the poor Lady compleatly un|happy,
he is Jealous of her to the la&s;t degree,
and treats her very hardly on that Account;
and when &s;he expo&s;tulates with him upon that
Head, and appeals to him for her Conduct ever
&s;ince Marriage, which has indeed been blame|le&s;s,
the Brute runs it all back to the fir&s;t and
only fal&s;e Step of her Life, and, with a flout
upon all her Integrity and exactne&s;s of Living,
tells her, with an old <HI>Scots</HI> Ballad at the End
of it:
<Q><L>Titty, Tatty, Kitty, Katty,</L>
<L>Fal&s;e to ea Man, fal&s;e to au Men.</L></Q>
It &s;eems, 'tis a proverbial Saying for a Man
who has married a Whore, intimating, that as
&s;he was a Whore to him, &s;o &s;he would be a Whore
to any Body el&s;e, or to every Man.</P>
<P>THUS &s;he is all her Life &s;ubject to the Re|proach;
not forty Years Wedlock, and an un|blameable
Life, will make it up; the Debt is
never paid, and yet always a paying; and all
this for a &s;hameful yielding her &s;elf up a
few Days before the Form would have &s;anctified
the Action.</P>
<P>NOR is it &s;ufficient to plead, no not to
him&s;elf, that he importuned her, or &s;urprized
<PB N="285" REF="301">
her, or drew her in; tho&s;e Things are all for|got;
or, if remember'd, amount to no Excu&s;e.
The Breach in the Woman's Virtue being once
made, he mu&s;t be a Man of uncommon Temper,
and of a great deal of good Humour, that does
not one time or other throw it in her Face, and
load her with the Reproach of it.</P>
<P>IN the next Place, the hazard on the Wo|man's
Part is unequal, extremely unequal; for
&s;he runs the hazard of Mortality. Suppo&s;e the
Man would be ju&s;t to her, and marry her; but
then, as I once knew to be the Ca&s;e, &s;uppo&s;e
he falls &s;ick and dies; the Woman is undone,
&s;he is left with Child; &s;he cannot claim the
Man, nor the Child inherit from him as a Fa|ther;
&s;he has not only no right to any Thing
he has left, but, for want of a Power to make
&s;uch a Claim, &s;he di&s;covers that &s;he is not a
legal Wife, but was his Whore; and this in
&s;pight of ten thou&s;and Promi&s;es of Marriage;
ay, though there were ten thou&s;and Witne&s;&s;es
of tho&s;e Promi&s;es. So certain is it, that no
Promi&s;es of Matrimony make a Marriage, and
that a Woman cannot expo&s;e her &s;elf with
greater Di&s;advantage, than to take Matrimony
upon tru&s;t; that all the A&s;&s;urance that it is po&s;|&s;ible
for a Man to give her, cannot be an equi|valent
to the &s;acrifice of her Virtue, be&s;ides
the ri&s;que of Mortality, <HI>as above,</HI> in which Ca&s;e
&s;he is inevitably ruin'd.</P>
<P>AND after all, what Pretence is there for
the thing, &s;ince Matrimony is the Matter treated
of? Why is not the Treaty fini&s;hed? and if the
Treaty is fini&s;hed, why in &s;uch ha&s;te for the
Con&s;ummation? or why the Con&s;ummation
without the Ceremony, or before it? Horrid un|re&s;trained
Appetite! Why mu&s;t the brutal Part
<PB N="286" REF="302">
be gratified at the Woman's Expence, and that
at an Expence &s;o very great, that nothing can
make amends for it?</P>
<P>I knew a Di&s;a&s;ter happen on the very
&s;ame Ca&s;e as this, when Mortality interpos'd;
Death &s;natch'd away the Man, in the very
critical Moment.</P>
<P>THE Ca&s;e was thus: A young Man courted
a neighbouring Maid; the Girl had a very
good Character, was not a Servant, liv'd with
her Mother, and liv'd tolerably well; but his
Circum&s;tances were the better of the two; &s;o
that it was thought to be a very good Match
for her.</P>
<P>THEIR Marriage was agreed on; and the
young Woman, at his Reque&s;t, took a
Lodging in the Town where he liv'd; &s;everal
Things for a time prevented their marrying,
and particularly the want of a Licence; but
he being, after &s;ome time, obliged to go to <HI>Lon|don,</HI>
on &s;ome particular Occa&s;ion, he promis'd
his Mi&s;tre&s;s to bring a Licence down with
him to marry her.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, in this Interval it unhappily ap|peared
that he had prevailed with her to let
him Lie with her, and the Girl proved with
Child. He was &s;o ju&s;t to her, that when he
came back from <HI>London,</HI> where he had &s;taid
&s;ome time, he brought the Licence with him,
and twice they went together to a neighbour|ing
Mini&s;ter to be married; but &s;till one Thing
or other intervened; as once they came too
late, the Canonical Hour being pa&s;t, the &s;cru|pulous
Gentleman refu&s;ted, and would not; and
the next time the Mini&s;ter was really very
ill, and could not, but appointed them to come
the next <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> that being <HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> and
<PB N="287" REF="303">
he would not fail, GOD willing, to marry
them.</P>
<P>ON the Evening of the <HI>Wedne&s;day,</HI> the
young Man was taken &s;ick, which proved to
be the Small-Pox, and, in a few Days, he died.
He declared upon his Death-bed, that &s;he was,
as he called it, his betrothed Wife; own'd the
Child to be his, obliged his Mother to take
Care of the young Woman, and of the Child,
which was as much as Providence allowed him
time to do.</P>
<P>BUT this took Wind; the young Woman
was known to be with Child, and known to be
unmarried; and &s;ome maliciou&s;ly informed the
Pari&s;h Officers of it, and they the Ju&s;tices of
the Peace, on pretence of &s;ecuring the Pari&s;h.
But the young Man's Mother an&s;wered pre|&s;ently
to the &s;atisfaction of the Pari&s;h; and
the Mini&s;ter te&s;tify'd for both the young Man
and the young Woman al&s;o, that they were
twice with him to be married; &s;o that the ho|ne&s;ty
of Intention was on both Sides apparent;
yet the young Woman was expo&s;ed by it to the
la&s;t degree.</P>
<P>WHAT Folly, as well as Wickedne&s;s, was
here? A young well-meaning Woman prevail'd
with, on the weak Pretence of being e&s;&s;entially
though not formally married; I &s;ay, prevail'd
with, to gratify the Man at the hazard, and,
as it proved, at the co&s;t or price of her Virtue
and of her Reputation; forced to acknowledge
her &s;elf a Whore, and to bring a Ba&s;tard
into the World; when, upon only waiting
a few Days, all the Scandal, all the Re|proach,
and, which is more, the Crime al&s;o
had been avoided.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="304">
HERE was Whoredom under the Protection,
or in the Colour and Di&s;gui&s;e of Matrimony!
He told her, they were married in the Sight of
Heaven; he called her his Wife, and 'twas too
evident he us'd her as &s;uch; and Heaven, in
Ju&s;tice, brought her to Shame for it. What
was this but a Matrimonial Whoredom? and
that of a fatal Kind; a Kind that has &s;o
many weak and vile Pretences for it, but yet
&s;o fair and &s;pecious, that many (till then)
innocent Women, have been impo&s;ed upon by
them, and ruined.</P>
<P>BUT that which is &s;till unaccountable in it, is,
that the Hazard is &s;o great, and the Benefit,
the Gratification, or what other ugly thing
we may call it, is &s;o very &s;mall: 'Tis like a
Man and Woman on Hor&s;eback, venturing to
ford, or rather &s;wim, a deep and rapid River,
when the Ferry-boat is ju&s;t ready on the other
Side, and may be called to them in a few Mi|nutes,
to carry them over &s;afe. There is no
common Sen&s;e, no rational Argument, in their
favour. But the Brutal Part prevails; the
Woman, abu&s;ed with fine Promi&s;es, pro&s;ti|tutes
her Honour, her Virtue, her Religion,
and her Po&s;terity, on the lighte&s;t and mo&s;t
&s;candalous Pretences that can be imagined; and
when &s;he has done, has nothing to &s;ay but old
<HI>Eve</HI>'s Plea, <HI>The Serpent beguiled me.</HI></P>
<P>I know nothing that can be &s;aid for the
Man; nothing but what is too vile for me to
mention, too gro&s;s for my Pen; and, as I &s;aid
in another Place, the Crime mu&s;t go without
its ju&s;t Cen&s;ure, only becau&s;e it is too gro&s;s
to be named. The Motives to it are &s;o wicked,
the Pretences for it &s;o foul, and there is &s;o
little to be &s;aid in Defence of it, that, in &s;hort,
<PB N="289" REF="305">
the be&s;t Thing I can add, is to &s;ay, 'tis the
wor&s;t Piece of Matrimonial Wickedne&s;s that
can be practi&s;ed; I call it Matrimonial, becau&s;e
committed under the Shelter of that &s;acred Cover|ing;
the holy Ordinance is made the di&s;gui&s;e
for it, the Woman is beguiled, under the Ma&s;que,
and on the Pretence of its being no Crime.</P>
<P>THE Man is the Deceiver; he acts the De|vil's
Part every Way, he is the Tempter, and
is a Party to the Crime: As for him&s;elf, his
Rea&s;on mu&s;t be &s;ubjected, or he could never
&s;ubmit to &s;o &s;ordid an Action; he mu&s;t be
degenerated into &s;omething below a Man; his
Appetite mu&s;t be all brutal and raging, per|fectly
out of the government of his Under|&s;tanding;
in a word, he mu&s;t be out of him|&s;elf;
the thing is &s;o contrary to Rea&s;on, that
it is indeed contrary to Nature, and to common
Sen&s;e, for a Man to defile his own Bed, corrupt
his own Race, make a Whore of his own Wife;
nothing can be more incon&s;i&s;tent with Nature,
and, as I &s;ay, with common Sen&s;e; not to &s;ay
a Word about Religion, or the Laws of GOD;
The&s;e, to the People I am &s;peaking of, are not
to be mentioned, or, in the lea&s;t, &s;uppo&s;ed to
have been thought of.</P>
<P>WHAT mu&s;t the Man or the Woman think
of them&s;elves, when, after Marriage, they
come to reflect upon this Part? What Re|proaches
will they ca&s;t upon one another?
What Comfort, as the Scripture &s;ays, can they
have <HI>in tho&s;e Things whereof they are now a|&s;hamed?</HI>
Granting for once what, however,
very &s;eldom happens, that they do not come to
Reproach one another, and Revile one ano|ther;
&s;uppo&s;e the Man good-humour'd enough
not to abu&s;e his Wife for her ea&s;y complying,
<PB N="290" REF="306">
or to be jealous of her doing the &s;ame for
others, according to the <HI>Scots</HI> Song mentioned
above: On the other hand, &s;uppo&s;e the Wo|man
does not upbraid the Man with delud|ing
her, making a thou&s;and &s;currilous Re|flections
upon him, for drawing her in by his
fair Promi&s;es, his horrid Oaths and &s;olemn
Prote&s;tations, and now to upbraid her with
yielding. Suppo&s;e, I &s;ay, the Man and the
Woman both, not &s;o ill-humour'd as to Re|proach
one another with the Crime; yet they
will deeply Reproach them&s;elves, for laying
them&s;elves &s;o open to publick Scandal, for
the &s;atisfying a meer Gu&s;t, and the prevailing
Importunities of their corrupted Appetite, when
&s;o &s;mall a Time of forbearance would have
made all &s;afe on both Sides.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, let the Self-Reproaches
on either Side be ever &s;o &s;evere; let the Repen|tance
be as &s;incere and as publick as you plea&s;e
to imagine it, the Fact is the &s;ame; and I can|not
call the Thing it &s;elf any thing more or
le&s;s than, according to my Title, a Matrimonial
Whoredom, and that in the cour&s;e&s;t Degree.</P>
<P>PERHAPS &s;ome may think my Cen&s;ure too
hard on the other Side; I mean, as to the
Man's marrying the Woman afterwards; and
that while I exclaim &s;o loudly again&s;t the Of|fence
of lying together, though under &s;acred
Promi&s;es of Matrimony, I encourage the Men
to break tho&s;e Promi&s;es, pretending, that the Of|fence
being already &s;o great, they can be no
wor&s;e; for &s;ince it does not le&s;&s;en the Crime, &s;ay
they, what &s;hould they marry the Woman for? If
&s;he mu&s;t be counted a Whore all her Days, and he
a Criminal, though he is &s;o hone&s;t as to marry
her, what &s;ignifies the Hone&s;ty? He can be
<PB N="291" REF="307">
no wor&s;e if he lets it alone? And thus
my Reproof, they &s;ay, will do more hurt than
good.</P>
<P>TO this I an&s;wer: Let the Woman then pro|vide
again&s;t that; for I &s;hall never think Pity
due to any Woman after this, who, being thus
warn'd, will let a Man lie with her up|on
Promi&s;es of After-Marriage; there can
be no wrong done to the Woman, &s;eeing &s;he
may avoid the Danger by avoiding the
Crime; and yet the Man is greatly mi&s;taken
too, who pretends, that to break his Engage|ment
with the Woman does not encrea&s;e the
Offence. If this were true, and that by per|forming
the Promi&s;e the Per&s;on was not the le&s;s
Criminal, the Offender would always take
care not to perform the Obligation; and &s;o
we &s;hould have a continual Complaint. But,
I &s;ay, let it be &s;o; nay, let the Woman take
it for granted, <HI>I am &s;ure &s;he ought to do &s;o,</HI>
that whenever &s;he yields on &s;uch Terms, &s;he
will be left in the lurch, and expo&s;ed; and this,
if any thing, would &s;hut the Door again&s;t her complying.</P>
<P>NAY, I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, the common U|&s;age
is &s;o much again&s;t her, that one would
wonder any Woman &s;hould be &s;o weak
to yield upon tho&s;e Conditions; and, to
me, it argues nece&s;&s;arily one of the&s;e two
Things.</P>
<P>1. GREAT neglect of the Con&s;equences of
Things; great Indifference not only as to her
being with Child or not with Child, taken or
refu&s;ed, married or not married; and &s;o al&s;o
with re&s;pect to her Fame and Character, whe|ther
Hone&s;t or a Whore. But,</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="308">
2. IT argues likewi&s;e a perfect Indifference
as to the Crime; and as to its being an Offence,
again&s;t GOD or Man; and &s;uch a Woman ought
not to be &s;uppo&s;ed to value the Sin of be|ing
a Whore, any more than the Scandal of
it.</P>
<P>INDEED; to be utterly thoughtle&s;s of the
Con&s;equence, and every Way as wicked as the
Man, &s;eems to be ju&s;t the Character of the Wo|man
in this particular Ca&s;e: And I mu&s;t leave it
upon her, that &s;he who thus complies, declares her
&s;elf, by the very Fact, to be utterly uncon|cerned
about her Character, whether as a Wo|man
of Virtue, or as a Chri&s;tian; and if ever
&s;he is brought to her Sen&s;es again, &s;he mu&s;t
be convinced, that &s;he de&s;erves to be &s;o un|der&s;tood.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">OF A HUSBAND KNOWING HIS WIFE AFTER CON|CEPTION,
OR AFTER SHE IS KNOWN TO BE
WITH CHILD. OF THE REASONABLENESS AND
OF THE LAWFULNESS OF IT. AND WHETHER
THIS MAY NOT COME UNDER THE JUST DENO|MINATION
OF MATRIMONIAL WHORE|DOM.</HEAD>
<P>_AS the Procreation of Children is the
only, or at lea&s;t the chief Rea&s;on of
Matrimony; &s;o when the Woman
has once conceived, it is the Opinion
of the learned and mode&s;t World,
her Husband ought to <HI>know her no more</HI> till &s;he
has brought forth, and is delivered of her Bur|then.</P>
<P>SOME will have this be called a rigid Law;
that there is nothing in the Laws of GOD to
direct &s;uch a Re&s;traint, and that therefore 'tis
what the Text calls binding <HI>heavy Burthens;</HI>
like the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> impo&s;ing Severities on others,
which they would not be bound by them&s;elves;
and, as the &s;ame Text hints, would not <HI>touch
them with one of their Fingers,</HI> that is to &s;ay,
would not ob&s;erve, or be under the Obligation of
<PB N="294" REF="310">
tho&s;e Laws which they preached up the Nece&s;&s;ity
and Duty of to the People.</P>
<P>THE Que&s;tion before me, at pre&s;ent, is not
who does, or does not obey and ob&s;erve the Rules
of Mode&s;ty, which we lay open to be their
Duty; but whether tho&s;e Rules are ju&s;t, and
&s;uch as ought to be ob&s;erved, yea or no? If
they who dictate Laws do not obey the &s;ame
Laws, be that double Guilt to them&s;elves, and
be theirs the Repentance; the Debt is no le&s;s a
Debt for its not being paid, but 'tis doubly a
Debt upon tho&s;e that in&s;truct others to pay
it. However, that's a Subject to be entered upon
by it &s;elf, our pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s is to &s;peak of
the Thing as it lies before us.</P>
<P>THE Article I have now mentioned, is not
&s;o much a Rule of Decency, as it is a Law
of Nature; the Obligation to it, is therefore
back'd with a &s;uperior Authority: It is not
founded in Cu&s;tom and Habit; it is not the
Effect of the Cur&s;e, or brought in as Mode&s;ty is,
as the Fruit of the Fall. Shame and Blu&s;hing
may be the Con&s;equence of Sin; but the Sea|&s;ons,
and the Laws of Generation, are the Off|&s;pring
of Nature; the great Parent of Life is
the director and guide of Life, and has ap|pointed
the Laws of it as a general Head of
Con&s;titutions, by which all the Creatures are
directed, and generally &s;peaking, all the
Creatures are willingly, becau&s;e naturally &s;a|tisfied
with tho&s;e Con&s;titutions, and freely|obey
them.</P>
<P>THE Brutes obey the Laws of Nature; 'tis
not a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, not a &s;ubjection, but a meer
Con&s;equence of their Life; and 'tis the man|ner
in which their natural Powers are di|rected;
'tis the Channel in which they flow;
<PB N="295" REF="311">
they know their Sea&s;ons, and they follow as
Nature leads; cha&s;te and re&s;erved when the
Streams of Nature abate, hot and furious when
the Animal Spirits return; in a word, they
come when Nature calls, and not before.</P>
<P>BUT Man! ungoverned Man! neither in|fluenced
by the Laws of GOD, or of Nature,
gives him&s;elf a loo&s;e to his corrupted De&s;ires,
and &s;ubjects Nature, Rea&s;on, and even Reli|gion
it &s;elf, to his Appetite; in &s;hort, to a cor|rupted
and depraved Appetite, a furious out|rageous
Gu&s;t; his Will governs his Under&s;tand|ing,
and his Vice governs his Will; the brutal
Part tyrannizes over the Man, and his Rea&s;on
is over-ruled by his Sen&s;e.</P>
<P>IT is ob&s;erved of the Deer, that whereas it
is a mild, quiet, gentle Creature; tame, even
by its own Di&s;po&s;ition, plea&s;ant and inoffen|&s;ive,
and this through almo&s;t all the Sea&s;ons
of the Year; yet, in its Sea&s;on, that is what
they call its Rutting-time, they are the mo&s;t
furious of all Creatures; and though they do
not, like the ravenous and voracous Kinds,
&s;uch as the Lyon or Bear, fall upon other
Creatures for their Food, and to &s;atisfy their
Hunger, which, as is ob&s;erved, is a Rea&s;on
for their being &s;o dangerous: Yet, on the other
hand, the Stag, or the Buck, at that particular
time, flies upon Man or Bea&s;t, and will kill
and trample under its Feet whatever comes
near him, or, at lea&s;t, offers to come near its
Female.</P>
<P>NO Park-Keepers, Rangers of Fore&s;ts, or
others, how bold and daring, or however fami|liar
among them, will dare to come near them
in their Rutting-time, unle&s;s very well armed
and attended; that is, with Dogs and Guns;
<PB N="296" REF="312">
even the Dogs them&s;elves, though they are
their Terror at another time, except it be the
whole Pack together, will not meddle with
them if they can help it.</P>
<P>NATURALISTS tell us, that the Blood of
the Creature at that time, is boiling hot; and
though it be not in a <HI>Fever,</HI> which, they &s;ay,
in a Dog is Madne&s;s; or in Cats, and &s;ome other
Creatures, becau&s;e it does not lie in the
Head, as it does in Dogs, and &s;&s;ch other Crea|tures
as are &s;ubject to Madne&s;s, yet that
the Spirits are in as high a ferment in the&s;e,
as tho&s;e are.</P>
<P>BE that as it will, 'tis certain this is the Work
of Nature, not a Di&s;ea&s;e upon Nature; and
when the End, which is Generation and Pro|pagation
of the Kind, is an&s;wered; when the
Sea&s;on is over, the Creature returns to its na|tural
calm and quiet; to a Di&s;po&s;ition familiar
and dome&s;tick; will come up to the Keeper,
feed out of his hand, and be as tame again
as before.</P>
<P>THIS fury of the Blood, however raging in
the Buck, I &s;ay abates with the Sea&s;on, and
he returns to be the &s;ame gentle plea&s;ant Crea|ture
he was before. But it is not &s;o with the
Man; when the fury of his Appetite, prompt|ed
by the youth of his Spirit, ri&s;es to a highth
a little more than common, it continues there;
'tis not &s;lacked by the Evacuations natural to
the Ca&s;e, but he continues a Madman &s;till, and
knows no Bounds.</P>
<P>IN vain is Rea&s;on given him, and intended
by the Giver to be the guide and the govern|er
of his Life; to be his Director, and to com|mand
his Pa&s;&s;ions and Affections; his Appetite
getting once the government, like a hard|mouth'd
<PB N="297" REF="313">
Hor&s;e, he feels no Curb, knows no
Re&s;traint, and is guided by no Reins but tho&s;e
of his enraged Will.</P>
<P>I can de&s;cribe the Article I am upon by
no Mediums but tho&s;e of Simily and Allegory.
Decency forbids me &s;peaking plainer than this.
The Man is a Fury, and knows no limits to
the Rage of his Inclination; but, pu&s;hed on by
the Heat of ungoverned Nature, and &s;uppo|&s;ing
an unlimited Liberty is given him by the
Marriage-Licence, which, by the way, is a
mi&s;take, he acts all the immode&s;t Things ima|ginable
with a &s;ugge&s;ted Impunity.</P>
<P>HENCE Sodomy it &s;elf has been not only
acted, but even ju&s;tify'd in the Marriage-Bed;
and indeed, one may be expected as well as
the other; for why may we not look for one
unnatural Exce&s;s, as well as another.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Turks,</HI> 'tis a little hard I mu&s;t be forced
to leave the Practice of Chri&s;tians, and go look
among the <HI>Turks</HI> and Infidels for Examples of
Mode&s;ty and Decency, but &s;o it is; the <HI>Turks,</HI>
I &s;ay, have brought this very Offence which
I complain of, under the Government of their
Laws; and, as I &s;aid before, it is remarkable,
and a Pattern for Chri&s;tians, that they try
tho&s;e Cau&s;es in a manner much more awful
and grave than we do.</P>
<P>NOR is the Woman under that Re&s;traint,
which they are here, where, tho' &s;he is perhaps
gro&s;ly injured, &s;he cannot do her &s;elf Ju&s;tice,
becau&s;e Mode&s;ty forbids her Tongue expre&s;&s;ing
the Particulars, and de&s;cribing the Fact. But
there, if any unlawful Violence is offered to a
Woman by her Husband, under the Liberties
of the Marriage-Bed, and &s;he finds her &s;elf &s;o
<PB N="298" REF="314">
aggrieved, as that &s;he is obliged to &s;eek redre&s;s,
&s;he proceeds thus:</P>
<P>1. SHE goes to the proper Officer, and de|mands
a Summons for her Husband to appear
before the Grand Vizier, to an&s;wer to her Com|plaint.</P>
<P>2. WHEN he appears, and &s;he is call'd in to
ju&s;tify her Charge, &s;he &s;ays not a Word; nor
is her Face unveiled, till &s;he comes to what we
call taking her Oath: But then, unveiling her
Face, &s;he &s;toops down, takes off her Slipper in
the Face of the Court, and holds it up to the
Judge (the Grand Vizier) turning it the wrong
Side upward.</P>
<P>THIS is enough to the Court, who under&s;tand
her di&s;tinctly, namely, that &s;he &s;wears upon
the <HI>Alchoran</HI> that her Husband offers unnatural
Violences to her, and that &s;he cannot live with
him upon that Account. She needs &s;ay no
more; but upon this Proce&s;s &s;he obtains a Di|vorce
again&s;t him, unle&s;s he can do one or both
of the following Things:</P>
<P>1. CLEAR him&s;elf of the Charge; or,</P>
<P>2. GIVE &s;ufficient Security for not offering
the like to her again.</P>
<P>THERE is no need to demand a farther Ex|planation
of the&s;e Things, or to ask me, what
is meant by offering unnatural Violences to a
Wife? Tho&s;e Que&s;tions aim evidently at what
I have from the Beginning prote&s;ted again&s;t;
and any ju&s;t and mode&s;t Reader will under&s;tand
what I mean by that.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="315">
IT is enough to tell you, that the very
Thing I complain of in the Head of this
Chapter is one of them: It is enough, that the
Woman has conceived, and is with Child.
What can be de&s;ired of her more, is, in the
Language of <HI>Mahometan</HI> Mode&s;ty, a Violence,
nay, an unnatural Violence; and the Woman
complains of it as highly injurious.</P>
<P>THE Woman has indeed a &s;trong and unan|&s;werable
Argument again&s;t the Man in ca&s;e of
this Complaint, which, 'tis true, we cannot
plead here; namely, that &s;he holds up two,
or three Sticks, which are given her by the Offi|cers,
intimating, that her Husband can plead
no Nece&s;&s;ity for his u&s;ing her in that manner,
for that he has one, two or three Wives be|&s;ides
her, according to the Number of Sticks
which &s;he expo&s;es, or holds up, and that there|fore
he ought to let her alone to go on in her
Pregnancy, that &s;he may bring forth a Man
Child without danger of Mi&s;carriage, which,
'tis &s;ugge&s;ted, might otherwi&s;e happen to her
by that Violence.</P>
<P>I very much doubt this will be called a new
Doctrine here; and I have been told already
(by a Man of Mode&s;ty too) upon reading it in
the Manu&s;cript, that I &s;hall never per&s;uade
Chri&s;tians to believe it Criminal, whatever
the <HI>Turks</HI> may do. But why &s;hould I &s;u&s;pect
this, where, as I &s;aid before, it is not the Law
of Matrimony, or the Law of <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Pagans</HI>
that I am mentioning, but the Law of Nature;
though Cuftom may be argued to be a Law,
or as a Law, and that in many Things. Cu&s;tom
is a Tyrant; Nature is a ju&s;t and limited Go|vernment.
Cu&s;tom is Anarchy and Confu&s;ion;
<PB N="300" REF="316">
Nature is a regulated Monarchy, and a well|e&s;tabli&s;hed
Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>BUT, to go farther; the Law I am &s;peaking
of, is Nature, &s;upported by Rea&s;on; or, if you
plea&s;e, Rea&s;on &s;upported by Nature. Rea&s;on
thinks it ju&s;t to follow where Nature leads,
and where there is no ju&s;t and rational Ob|jection
again&s;t her Dictates, becau&s;e Nature is
certainly judge of her own Con&s;titutions, and
be&s;t knows her own Actings; her Influences
run in &s;ecret Channels, which no Force ought
to ob&s;truct, and, when they do not &s;well be|yond
Bounds, ought not to be check'd and &s;top'd
up.</P>
<P>THERE are many Arguments in Philo&s;ophy,
as well as in Medicine or Phy&s;ick, why the
Cour&s;e of Nature &s;hould not be ob&s;tructed and
interrupted; and except where her Exorbi|tances
&s;eem to break out into Offence, &s;he
ought not to be re&s;trained, and even there
but gently and with good Rea&s;on, and in its
proper Time.</P>
<P>BUT Cu&s;tom pretends to govern Nature with
a kind of ab&s;olute Dominion, and to tyran|nize
over all the Laws of Rea&s;on and of Na|ture
too.</P>
<L>&startq;Cu&s;tom, which all Mankind to Slav'ry brings,</L>
<L>That dull Excu&s;e for doing &s;illy Things.&endq;</L>
<P>NOW if Cu&s;tom has &s;et up a vitious Practice,
in contradiction to Nature and Rea&s;on too,
&s;hall this be a received Law among us, who
pretend to know and practi&s;e &s;o well? Be&s;ides, as
the Devil &s;aid to the Sons of <HI>Sceva,</HI> Nature we
know, Rea&s;on we know, but who are you?
You, Cu&s;tom, you are an Invader and an U&s;ur|per;
<PB N="301" REF="317">
an Invader of Nature, and an U&s;urper of
the Throne of Rea&s;on, that &s;ets up for a Judge
of Convenience, and a Judge of Right and
Wrong, to which you have no more Claim
than you have to judge of Truth and Reli|gion.</P>
<P>IN all &s;uch Ca&s;es, it is but a ju&s;t Enquiry to
make here, What is this Cu&s;tom derived from?
And I am &s;ure, in this Ca&s;e, it mu&s;t be an|&s;wered,
this Cu&s;tom is begun in Crime; it is
derived from an Offence; and, as is the Tree,
&s;uch is the Fruit, offen&s;ive; for this Evil Tree
cannot bring forth good Fruit; it derives from
vitiated and corrupt Affections, heated Blood,
and debauch'd &s;uppre&s;s'd Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>DO Men gather Grapes of the&s;e Thorns?
Can good come out of this Evil? Corrupt Ap|petite,
unre&s;trained Will, break out in corrupt
Actions, and continued in, grow up to corrupt
Habits, and this we call Cu&s;tom; when it is
grown up to that Name, Cu&s;tom, it immedi|ately
begins to Tyrannize, and make it &s;elf
an Excu&s;e for its own Errors. In a word, Men
go on in a Cu&s;tom, becau&s;e it is a Cu&s;tom;
&s;o it gets Years on its Side, and then 'tis called
an old Cu&s;tom, an antient Cu&s;tom, which adds
Veneration to it, and, at la&s;t, an immemorial
Cu&s;tom, or, as we vulgarly expre&s;s it, <HI>a Cu&s;tom,
Time out of mind;</HI> which is &s;ufficient to make
a Law of it.</P>
<P>THIS Corruption u&s;urped upon Nature, and,
turned into Cu&s;tom, is the Thing we have to
combat with in the Article before us, in which
we have this lawful Plea to bring again&s;t it;
(<HI>viz.</HI>) That Cu&s;tom in Crime is ju&s;t as much a
Defence for it, as Antiquity, in Error, and is
indeed the &s;ame thing; and &s;o, in the Ca&s;e
<PB N="302" REF="318">
before me; for a Man to &s;ay, I have always
done &s;o, you &s;tartle me a little, 'tis true, I did not
examine into the thing, but I never made any
he&s;itation about it; 'tis a Cu&s;tom, and, I be|lieve,
every Body does it as well as we; and
therefore I cannot think 'tis a Crime; you
mu&s;t preach it down in general; when it comes
to be chang'd by other People, I'll think of
it, but, I believe, every Body does &s;o, as well
as I.</P>
<P>THESE are really dangerous, as well as
unju&s;t Arguings, and the more &s;o, becau&s;e
they are too true, and too real. But what
is then to be done? Mu&s;t Cu&s;tom, founded up|on
the mo&s;t &s;candalous Mi&s;take, take Place?
It was, in its very original, an Encroachment
upon Nature, upon Mode&s;ty, and upon Tem|perance,
and &s;hall we plead its Antiquity,
which is &s;o far from an Excu&s;e, that it is
an addition to its Crime; this is as if a con|victed
Highwaymen &s;hould plead for Mercy,
becau&s;e he had been forty Years in the Trade,
an old Offender, and long practis'd in the
Crime.</P>
<P>IF the Cu&s;tom is wicked; if it is, in its
original, a Trea&s;on again&s;t Virtue, and an En|croachment
upon Nature; will any Man plead
for the Practice, becau&s;e their Ance&s;tors were
guilty of it before them.</P>
<P>THERE is indeed a happy Article in this Argu|ment,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) that there is not one Word of Excu&s;e
for it, but this fooli&s;h Plea of its being a
Cu&s;tom; all other Arguments are again&s;t it; 'tis
evidently a Pollution in Nature, a Scandal to its
Purity, to its Virtue, to its Moderation, and
to all that can be called Prudent and Wi&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="319">
PROCREATION of the Species, and the Ge|neration
of Mankind, is the ju&s;t End of Ma|trimony;
'tis expre&s;s'd &s;o in the Office of Matri|mony,
and in the &s;acred Text, in many Places;
Now when the Woman is with Child, the End
of Matrimony is an&s;wered; the Demand is at
an End till &s;he is light again (as the Women
call it). Some would fain plead a progre&s;&s;ive
Conception, and that there is a Supply wanting
to compleat the Formation of the <HI>Foetus,</HI> and a
great deal more of that Kind.</P>
<P>BUT this is evidently a Mi&s;take, and the
contrary is manife&s;t; the Work of Conception
is hit off at once; the Materials being furni&s;h|ed,
Nature being &s;et on Work, all the forming
Parts are engaged together; they may, indeed,
be hindered and interrupted in their Opera|tion
by future Agre&s;&s;ions, and by the very
Offence which I complain of; but that any
addition can be made to the Work of Nature,
e&s;pecially in the manner, and at the di&s;tance of
Time that we &s;peak of, is gro&s;ly ab&s;urd, and
contrary to Nature.</P>
<P>THE limitation of Time when, as I &s;ay, the
Man &s;hould know his Wife no more, is plac'd
at &s;o convenient a di&s;tance, as that of her be|ing
known to be with Child. If there were
any &s;uch Thing as a &s;econd Conception, or ad|ditions
to the Work of Conception, auxiliar to
Nature; I &s;ay, if there were any &s;uch thing, as
I can by no means grant, tho' I do not di&s;pute
it here; yet 'tis evident it mu&s;t be at or about
the Beginning of the Conception, not at four
or five Months di&s;tance of Time, for then a
Woman might go with two or more Children at
once, and bring them forth four or five Months
after one another; nay, a Woman might be

always Conceiving, always Breeding, and al|ways

<P>WHETHER mu&s;t the&s;e gro&s;s Ideas lead us?

than only to appeal to Rea&s;on and Experience,
and to all the learned Anatomi&s;ts and <HI>Accouch|ers,</HI>
to judge of it.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve, when I hint the Mode&s;ty of <HI>Ma h|ometan</HI>
Nations, and other People, who, as I
have &s;aid, ab&s;tain from their Wives as &s;oon as
they have Conceived, or, to put it right, as
&s;oon as they know they are with Child; I am
an&s;wered with a kind of eagerne&s;s, that it is
ea&s;y to them, becau&s;e having Plurality of
Women, or being allowed as many Wives as
they will, they can lay by one, and take
another as they plea&s;e; &s;o that they are never
without a Wife; but as &s;oon as one is with Child,
&s;he withdraws to her Apartment, and he knows
her no more. But then he calls another to his
Bed; and as &s;he may continue four or five
Months before he can be &s;ure &s;he is with Child,
by that time the fir&s;t is &s;ure to be delivered,
and be ready for his Bed again; and &s;o of all
the Wives in their Turn. And thus the Man
is never without a Woman for his Conve|nience.</P>
<P>IF this be &s;o, all that can be &s;aid for it
is, that this is a kind of Argument in favour
of Poligamy, that is to &s;ay, that we make u&s;e
of it as &s;uch. But the <HI>Turks</HI> are very far from
giving this as a Rea&s;on for their Poligamy:
The Rea&s;on of that Practice is taken from the
<PB N="305" REF="321">
Cu&s;tom of the Patriarchs, and is made a Part
of <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Law; and if they were not &s;o
allowed the u&s;e of many Women promi&s;cuou&s;ly,
it is certain they would &s;till ab&s;tain from their
Wives, during the time of their being with
Child.</P>
<P>IT is looked upon as a prepo&s;terous Thing,
a Pollution and Impurity; nay, they take it
to be nau&s;eous and unnatural; the &s;ober
Men among them &s;peak of it with dete&s;tation,
and upbraid the Chri&s;tians with it as acting
more than Bea&s;tial, for that very few of the
brute Creatures practi&s;e it; and, if you con&s;ider
it with exactne&s;s, you will not find any of the
Brutes that will admit, much le&s;s &s;eek the Con|junction
of their Sexes after Conception: However
eager when Nature prompted, and however
loud the Female calls the Male, yet, after the
Fire of Nature is quenched, &s;he fights him, and
flies at him if he attacks her.</P>
<P>IT would be an unplea&s;ant Task, and un|&s;uitable
to the ju&s;t Re&s;traint which I have put
upon my &s;elf in the fir&s;t Undertaking of this
difficult Work, if I &s;hould pretend to enter
here into a Philo&s;ophical or Anatomical De|&s;cription
of the Rea&s;on and Nature of the
brutal Appetites; their Sea&s;ons, their Conduct
in them, and their punctual ob&s;erving the
Laws of Nature in the various Circum&s;tances
of tho&s;e Sea&s;ons; their Conception; their
bringing forth their young; their &s;uckling
and nouri&s;hing them afterwards; how regular,
how exact, and how punctual the Creatures are
to tho&s;e Sea&s;ons; and how mode&s;t and uncon|cerned
with one another when tho&s; Sea&s;ons
are pa&s;t, or in the due Intervals of them.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="322">
I &s;ay, it would be an improper Search under
the Limitations which I am otherwi&s;e bound
by; the Enquiry would be very improving,
critical and curious; and &s;uch a Thing may not
be unprofitable in Surgery and Anatomy: But,
at pre&s;ent, our Subject points another Way;
and I am rather di&s;cour&s;ing the Morality, as well
as the Mode&s;ty of it, the rational, not phy&s;ical
Foundation of it; and &s;earching into the Rea|&s;on
why we give our &s;elves &s;uch Liberties which
the Savages, and undirected Part of Mankind,
do not take.</P>
<P>AS to the weak Excu&s;e, that the <HI>Mahometan</HI>
and <HI>Pagan</HI> Nations have a Plurality of Women,
&s;o that they &s;upply Nature's demands another
Way, 'tis a mo&s;t &s;candalous Confe&s;&s;ion, that
the vitious Part of the Man is the only occa&s;ion
of the Practice; and that this is done, not that
it is &s;uppo&s;ed to be right, but becau&s;e the Power
of the Vice prevails, and the Appetite rules the
Man, the Rea&s;on, and Nature is &s;ubjected to
De&s;ire, and the pure Flame is overborn by the
impure eruption of Salt and Sulphur.</P>
<P>AND where's the Chri&s;tian all this while?
Where are the nece&s;&s;ary Mortifications of a
holy Life? Where do &s;uch mortify the Deeds
of the Body? <HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 13. How have they
<HI>crucified the Fle&s;h with its Affections and Lu&s;ts?</HI>
Gal. v. 24.</P>
<P>SHALL Chri&s;tians, that pretend to walk by
the pure Pattern of their Saviour and his Apo|&s;tles,
and by the perfect Rule of the Scripture,
at the &s;ame time plead a nece&s;&s;ity of Polluting
them&s;elves, and that in a filthy and loath&s;ome
manner; a manner which they cannot &s;peak of
without Blu&s;hes; &s;hall the&s;e plead a &s;upply of the
<PB N="307" REF="323">
Demands of Nature, and a nece&s;&s;ity for want
of a Plurality of Women?</P>
<P>HOW ought &s;uch rather to remember, that
they are Chri&s;tians, and that the double Obli|gation
lies upon them to ab&s;tain from &s;uch
Things, by how much they pretend to a great|er
As&s;li&s;tance in their Mortifications from &s;upe|rior
and invi&s;ible Helps of Religion? How
do we fee the Clergy of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church
devote them&s;elves to a perpetual Celibacy, and
enter into &s;olemn Vows of Cha&s;tity, and per|form
them too; for tho' &s;ome may offend, we
cannot, with common Ju&s;tice, charge it upon
the whole Body of the Clergy, and of the Re|ligious
People?</P>
<P>AND &s;hall Prote&s;tants only pretend to a
nece&s;&s;ity of Crime, and that they cannot re|&s;train
them&s;elves from &s;ecret Lewdne&s;s, or
keep them&s;elves from &s;hameful Pollutions,
but that they mu&s;t allow them&s;elves to act
again&s;t Nature, and again&s;t Virtue, and even
again&s;t the Stomach? This is the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Piece
of confe&s;s'd Frailty that one can meet with
any where, and nothing that I know in Story
can come up to it.</P>
<P>AS to the Ab&s;tinence of tho&s;e who, in &s;ome
Countries, are allowed a Plurality of Wives,
we are a&s;&s;ured that &s;ome, yea, many of them,
after having had the Knowledge of one of their
Women, they knew her no more, till they have
an A&s;&s;urance that &s;he has not conceived, and
that &s;he is not with Child. The Grand Seig|nior,
'tis certain, acts thus among the Ladies of
the <HI>Seraglio;</HI> and, if we may believe &s;ome who
pretend to know, lives a much more temperate
Life, nd acts with a great deal more Modera|tion
among three or four hundred Ladies, all at
<PB N="308" REF="324">
his Command, than the Gentlemen I am &s;peak|ing
of do, with one Wife, and no more.</P>
<P>IN a word; among tho&s;e People, for a Man
to know a Woman after &s;he was already with
Child, would be dete&s;table, it would be an abo|mination
to them; the Woman would refu&s;e it
with as much Re&s;olution as &s;he would a Ra|vi&s;her,
and the Man mu&s;t be abandoned to all
that was counted bruti&s;h and unclean, that
&s;hould offer it.</P>
<P>WHETHER it be &s;o among us, or how it is
received and prati&s;ed among us Chri&s;tians, I
leave to the general Opinion, and to private
Experience, not meddling with that Part, as
too gro&s;s for me; though I might give Examples
too notorious, from the Mouths of our flagrant
Friends of the unblu&s;hing Club at <HI>Tony</HI>'s&mdash;,
and from the Te&s;timony and Confe&s;&s;ion of a|bundance
of the mode&s;t Society at&mdash;'s, be|&s;ides
&s;ome of the Ladies who have intermed|dled
&s;o lately, I do not &s;ay &s;o decently, in the
Affair, as to be partly the occa&s;ion of this
very Chapter, and of all the Parts of it; of
whom my wonderful Concern for their Fame,
gives me leave to &s;ay no more. It were to be
wi&s;hed, that they would, for the future, be
as careful of their own Characters, as I
am.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry, after all I have &s;aid upon this
filthy Subject, to ob&s;erve, that here are yet
no want of Advocates to defend the Prac|tice;
though I mu&s;t add, that there is a per|fect
&s;terility of Argument, or, at lea&s;t, rea|&s;onable
Arguments, to &s;upport their Defence
of it.</P>
<P>WHAT they &s;ay amounts to &s;o little, and
that little is &s;o &s;candalous in its Nature, and
<PB N="309" REF="325">
&s;its &s;o ill upon the Tongues of Men of Virtue
and Moderation, much le&s;s Men of Chri&s;tia|nity
and Religion, that I blu&s;h for them, and
conceal it. Nothing requires a more ju&s;t and
&s;evere Cen&s;ure, except it be the Action they
would defend by it.</P>
<P>TO &s;ay they cannot refrain, is to confe&s;s a
frailty which Papi&s;ts and Popi&s;h Votaries de|&s;pi&s;e,
and pretend to make &s;light of, nay,
which <HI>Pagans</HI> and <HI>Mahometans</HI> overcome by the
Power of their Religion. The <HI>Nuns</HI> dedicated
to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and to &s;uch and &s;uch Saints, undertake
to pre&s;erve an entire Cha&s;tity; and the Reli|gious
Orders of Monks and Friars do the
&s;ame; the Clergy univer&s;sally make no Diffi|culty
of it, and this for the length of their
whole Lives. And &s;hall Prote&s;tants not be a|&s;hamed
to &s;ay they cannot&mdash;for &s;o little
a Time, and &s;o ju&s;t an Occa&s;ion? 'Tis a mo&s;t
&s;hameful Nece&s;&s;ity they are under; if the
Fact be true, they ought, as I &s;aid in another
Ca&s;e, take Phy&s;ick, u&s;e Medicine, and &s;trive
by ju&s;tifiable Methods, to abate the Acri|mony
of their Blood, bringing them&s;elves into
a Rule or Regimen of Diet, that they may re|move
the Cau&s;e, and enable them to command
their raging De&s;ires, by weakening the De&s;ire
it &s;elf.</P>
<P>NOTHING is more certain, than that luxu|rious,
living, eating and drinking, what we
call rich Diet, high Sauces, &s;trong Wines, and
other Incentives, are great Occa&s;ions of Vice;
are Provocatives, and Rai&s;ers of other and more
&s;candalous Appetites; the Blood is heated and
fired, and the Spirits are inflamed; Nature is
elevated and prompted, and then we Plead and
Argue what we ought to be a&s;hamed &s;o much
<PB N="310" REF="326">
to name, and would Blu&s;h to do it it another
time.</P>
<P>THIS Luxury is not only a Sin in its own
Nature, but it is a &s;trong Motive to other Sins;
'tis the <HI>Devil</HI> at the Elbow, prompting and ex|citing,
and we ought to avoid the Cau&s;e as we
would obey the Scripture, which &s;ays, <HI>Flee
youthful Lu&s;ts;</HI> the Rea&s;on is given in the
very &s;ame Ver&s;e, for they <HI>War again&s;t the Soul;</HI>
they rai&s;e a Tumult in the Man, they arm his
Vices again&s;t his Rea&s;on, and procure him Ene|mies,
even from within, that are too hard for
him; in &s;hort, they rai&s;e the Devil, which he
cannot lay.</P>
<P>IT is an undeniable Maxim, that a luxu|rious
Appetite in eating and drinking rai&s;es an
ungoverned Appetite in other Plea&s;ures; Na|ture
obeys its own Laws: Great takings in
mu&s;t have great goings out; gro&s;s s&s;eding, and
&s;trong rich taking in of Diet, mu&s;t have Eva|cuations
in proportion; if there is an Acrimony
in the Blood, there is a phy&s;ical Application
nece&s;&s;ary in its Cour&s;e; great Dige&s;tures mu&s;t
have &s;trong Emeticks; there mu&s;t be Evacua|tions
of one Sort or other.</P>
<P>NOW a vitiated Appetite of one kind is the
Effect of a vitiated gorging the Appetite on
the other; and the gro&s;s feeding occa&s;ions gro&s;s
De&s;ires; on the other hand, to re&s;train and
limit the Appetite in eating and drinking, is
the only Way to get a compleat Victory over
our own Corruption.</P>
<P>A mortified Mind therefore, a Soul re&s;olv'd
not to be overcome, or be <HI>drawn a&s;ide of its own
Lu&s;ts, and enticed,</HI> but re&s;olved to mortify the
Fle&s;h, with its Affections and Lu&s;ts, would
re&s;train it &s;elf voluntarily, and &s;ubdue all the Oc|ca&s;ions
<PB N="311" REF="327">
of the Crime. Certainly high feeding is
the Original of high Vices, and brings the wor&s;t
Inconveniences of this kind upon the Man.
Hence Fa&s;tings were introduced in the primi|tive
Churches, and Mortifications, in order to
bring under the Body, and bring the Fle&s;h
into Subjection; and they are practis'd among
the mo&s;t devout of the Popi&s;h Reclu&s;es to this
time, in order to enable them to re&s;train natu|ral
Inclination, and they do find them ef|fectual;
the abating the quantity of Animal
Food, the pungent Particles of which &s;harpen
the Blood, pre&s;s upon the Nerves, and give an
ungoverned Vigour to the Spirits, is certainly
the Way, and an effectual Way to reduce the
Corruptions to the Government both of Rea&s;on
and Religion.</P>
<P>IF this Devil cannot be ca&s;t out but by
<HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>Fa&s;ting,</HI> then <HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>Fa&s;ting</HI>
mu&s;t be practis'd; for the Evil Spirit mu&s;t be
ca&s;t out, and the &s;trong Man mu&s;t be di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s'd.</P>
<P>NOR is it nece&s;&s;ary upon a religious Account
only, and to reduce us to the Rank of Chri|&s;tians;
but indeed, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary in the Ca&s;e
before us, to bring us to a due Exerci&s;e of our
Rea&s;on, and to act like Men, that we may not
live like human Bea&s;ts, without all Govern|ment,
and without any Subjection to the Domi|nion
of our Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>THIS then is the true Way to take off that
pitious Plea, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That they cannot re&s;train
them&s;elves. To act rea&s;onably would be to re|&s;train
our &s;elves; and tho&s;e that really can|not
&s;o re&s;train them&s;elves, grant, that they have
not the exerci&s;e of their Rea&s;on. If due Mor|tifications
were practi&s;ed, the difficulty of re|&s;training
them&s;elves would be taken away; in
<PB N="312" REF="328">
the particular Ca&s;e I am &s;peaking of, and the
Inclination would not be able to conquer the
Aver&s;ion; for there mu&s;t certainly be &s;ome|thing
&s;hocking to Nature in the Thing it &s;elf;
and there wants nothing but a decay of the
Ferment in the Blood to make the Victory
ea&s;y, and to bring the Enemy to be &s;ubdued.</P>
<P>AND to add to this Phy&s;ical Re&s;olution the
Methods of Diet, why &s;hould not both Men
and Women tie them&s;elves by &s;olemn Vows,
Promi&s;es and religious Re&s;olutions, to keep
them&s;elves within Bounds? Perhaps then they
would a&s;&s;i&s;t one another in the Performance.
Why do not <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> as well as <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> enter
into Vows of Continence? No doubt if they
would be a&s;&s;i&s;tant to one another to break tho&s;e
Charms of Hell, tho&s;e Filtres and Bewitchings,
which are certainly the Attacks of the Devil,
they might break them.</P>
<P>DID they do this, they would fortify one
another in the Ways of Virtue; and it would
not be &s;o ea&s;y to be drawn into Crime; a three|fold
Cord is not ea&s;ily broken, and here is a
threefold Help: As, (1.) A Conviction that you
ought to perform it. (2.) A &s;olemn Vow to
engage the Performance. And, (3.) Mutual
A&s;&s;i&s;tance both in the Vow and in the Re&s;olu|tion,
to pay it.</P>
<P>I would hope, that this vile Practice is car|ried
on among us, rather for want of knowing
how offen&s;ive it is, than for want of Power to
re&s;olve a Performance, and to engage the Mind
in it Cu&s;tom has made the Vice, however
odious in it &s;elf, &s;o natural to us, that there
are thou&s;ands of People among us at this
time, who, if you &s;hould ask about it, would
<PB N="313" REF="329">
readily an&s;wer with a &s;urprize, <HI>I profe&s;s I never
thought it had been an Offence.</HI></P>
<P>MEN go into it eager, without Con&s;idera|tion.
Nature gives faint checks to the Mind;
for even Nature, left entirely to it &s;elf, would
yet have &s;ome Reluctance, and would a little
recoil at the unnatural Action. But the Men
are us'd to it; there is no expre&s;s Law again&s;t
it; they fee no notice taken of it in the Scrip|ture,
or in any &s;ub&s;equent In&s;titutions; they
are under no Reftraints of that kind; and
where &s;hould they then be re&s;trained, and by
what?</P>
<P>IGNORANCE then of the nature of the Of|fence,
renders the Man in danger of commit|ting
it. The Cu&s;tom of the Country he lives
in is a terrible Plea, and he is too apt to cleave
to it, and venture upon the Cu&s;tom; he
knows no Law again&s;t it, and therefore &s;ees
no Crime, no Breach of any Law in the com|mitting
it.</P>
<P>HOW weak is corrupted Nature not to &s;ee
the Scandal of &s;o really odious and filthy a
Practice? And how far is this Ignorance from
being an Excu&s;e? It is indeed a Sin of Igno|rance,
but then it is a criminal ignorance too,
and &s;o it makes no excu&s;e for, but aggravates the
Charge, as Murther committed in Drunken|ne&s;s
is an aggravated Murther.</P>
<P>TO be ignorant of a thing that Nature dic|tates,
is &s;hutting the Eyes again&s;t natural
Light; re&s;i&s;ting the mo&s;t powerful Motive that
can be found oppo&s;ing it. Why do not &s;uch
People open their Eyes? Nature a&s;&s;i&s;ts them to
do it; but the debauched Inclination will fully
clo&s;e them; &s;o that the Ignorance is really as
criminal as the Action.</P>

SAINT <HI>Francis,</HI> if you will believe the Writers
of his Hi&s;tory, was particularly per&s;ecuted
with wicked and raging Inclinations to Wo|men;
and the Devil, who, by the way, knows
how to prompt us in that particular Article,
where Nature is weake&s;t and mo&s;t inclined to
yield, often laid Snares for him, and would
appear to him in the &s;hape of a beautiful Lady,
or in the appearance of lewd and indecent
Ge&s;tures. But to re&s;i&s;t him, and keep down
the rebelling Vice in his Blood, he would fall

the Militia mu&s;t be rais'd to &s;uppre&s;s them;
Violence mu&s;t be &s;uppre&s;s'd, by Violence; the
Torrent mu&s;t be check'd, and the Man be re|duced
to the Government of him&s;elf, and
brought into good Order by proper Powers;
for as it is (in &s;hort) a Tumult in his Soul,
and a Rebellion again&s;t the ju&s;t Dominion of
his Rea&s;on, &s;o he mu&s;t u&s;e the means Nature

Phy&s;ick, &s;uch Ab&s;tinence, and &s;uch Mortifi|cations
as I mention, as the be&s;t Medicine for
it as a Di&s;temper.</P>
<P>I am the longer upon this Subject of Ab&s;ti|nence
and Mortification in this Place, becau&s;e
the Pretence in this Article is, the Strength of
Inclination is too great; and that we CANNOT
compleat it, tho' it ought rather to be &s;aid,
WILL NOT. Now were it really true, that
they could not reduce and conquer the Incli|nation
by the force of ordinary Re&s;olution,
then the reducing the Principle of it is the
next &s;ure and effectual Method. Water may,
if the Quantity be &s;ufficient, conquer and put
out a Fire; but removing the Combu&s;tibles,
taking away the Fewel, is a never-failing Me|thod;
the fir&s;t may do it, but the la&s;t mu&s;t do
it. No Fire burns upon it &s;elf; that which we
call Burning, is nothing but penetrating and
dividing the Particles of Matter; if the Mat|ter
be removed, there is nothing to &s;eparate,
nothing to operate upon, and the Fire goes out
of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>THE like Plea for Mortifications holds good
in mo&s;t of the other Ca&s;es I have mentioned
in this Work; for &s;hould we trace all the raging
<PB N="317" REF="333">
Exce&s;&s;es which I have touch'd at in the former
Part of this Work to their true Original, we
&s;hould find much of it owing to the Extravagan|ces
of our Living in <HI>England;</HI> I mean, as to
eating and drinking. What is the Rea&s;on we
have &s;o many People die of Fevers here more
than in any other Part of the World? and that,
every Year or two, we have what we call a
new Di&s;temper, which carries off &s;o many,
that at tho&s;e Sea&s;ons the Weekly Bills in <HI>Lon|don</HI>
ri&s;e up to &s;ix hundred or &s;even hundred a
Week? Why is the Small-Pox &s;o fatal, and par|ticularly
among the Gentry and Per&s;ons of
Di&s;tinction, but becau&s;e of the Exce&s;&s;es of eat|ing
and drinking, in which, as well as in the
Nature of what we eat and drink, we go beyond
the re&s;t of Mankind?</P>
<P>THE &s;ame Rea&s;on is to be given for other
Things; the &s;ame Exce&s;&s;es ferment the Blood,
rai&s;e the Spirits, and produce all the immo|derate
&s;candalous Things which I have been
complaining of, and which there is &s;o much
Rea&s;on to complain of among us; in which
the <HI>Turks</HI> and Savages appear to act more like
Men of Rea&s;on than we do.</P>
<P>THEIR Way of Living is not &s;o high;
their Blood does not boil with the &s;ame in|temperate
Heats, con&s;equently their Ab&s;tinence
is not &s;o much a Virtue; but I mu&s;t add too,
that our Incontinence is the more a Vice; 'tis
a Crime occa&s;ioned by a Crime; and we ought
to u&s;e Temperance first in our Diet, and then
we &s;hall, with the more ea&s;e, practice Temper|ance
in other Things.</P>
<P>THE Crime of <HI>Sodom,</HI> however unnatural
the Vices are which they practi&s;ed, is laid all
upon a Cau&s;e, which was of the &s;ame Kind with
<PB N="318" REF="334">
ours, Pride and Idlene&s;s, and Fulne&s;s of
Bread. By which I under&s;tand, that their la&s;|civious
Wickedne&s;s proceeded from their luxu|rious
Diet; Sloth and Gluttony enraged their
Blood; and they fat upon the high Places to
do Evil.</P>
<P>OUR fulne&s;s of Bread mu&s;t be acknowledg'd
to be a great A&s;&s;i&s;tant to our immoderate Appe|tite
another Way; for this high Feeding gives
high Spirits, and the&s;e prompt to all exorbitant
Crimes. Exce&s;s of the Animal Spirits fill and
fire the Blood, and when tho&s;e heats rage, then
the Head contrives Wickedne&s;s. I need not &s;peak
it plainer, the Ca&s;e is ea&s;ily under&s;tood. No
thing can bring us to a Life of Moderation in
our Plea&s;ures, like a Life of Temperance and
Moderation in eating and drinking.</P>
<P>BUT I come from the Cau&s;e to the Crime;
and mu&s;t &s;ay a Word or two more to that.</P>
<P>AMONG all the bruti&s;h Circum&s;tances of it,
this is one, that 'tis an Action &s;tript of all mo|de&s;t
Pretences, all tolerable Excu&s;es; as it is a
meer Act of Pollution, &s;o there is not one
Word to be &s;aid to extenuate it; the Man can
only &s;ay, that he does it as an Excur&s;ion of
meer &s;en&s;uality, or a gratification to the Fle&s;h.
There can be no End in it, or Rea&s;on for it,
that can be &s;o much as named without Blu&s;h|ing.
The Woman is with Child, that's &s;uppo|&s;ed.
It is known, and &s;he acknowledges it.
What then can be &s;aid on that Side? The End
of the conjugal Act is already an&s;wered;
Wherefore does he come near her? 'Tis only to
&s;atisfy the cravings of his Vice, only to gra|tify
his fraile&s;t Part, to plea&s;e him&s;elf, or, as
the Scripture &s;ays, to &s;ulfil the Lu&s;ts of the
Fle&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="335">
THIS is an End &s;o ba&s;e, &s;o mean, &s;o ab&s;urd,
that no Chri&s;tian Man can plead it in Excu&s;e;
and yet, at the &s;ame time, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to
find any other Excu&s;e for it: In &s;hort, it is a
meer &s;hamele&s;s u&s;e of a Woman, to abate the
heat of his Spirits, and cool his Blood; 'tis
making a <HI>Nece&s;&s;ary-Hou&s;e</HI> of his Wife, and no|thing
more or le&s;s; and that indeed is a &s;ordid
Thing, &s;o much as in the &s;ugge&s;tion of it; 'tis
adding Scandal to the Crime, covering it with|out
a Cover; there's no Excu&s;e can be made
for it, no tolerable Name be given to it (that
I can find at lea&s;t) but this of Matrimonial
Whoredom, according to my Title.</P>
<P>LET us then think of reforming this &s;can|dalous
Practice; let us look at it in a due Per|&s;pective,
in a clear open Light. If any one
thing can with Modefty be &s;aid in Defence of
it, let us hear it; if not, if it is to be only
confe&s;s'd as a Crime, let it be for&s;aken as a
Crime. What cannot be defended, ought to be
reformed: What every one is a&s;hamed to &s;peak
for, none &s;hould be a&s;hamed to for&s;ake.</P>
<P>I could offer &s;ome Examples upon this Sub|ject,
but they are of &s;uch a cour&s;e kind, that
it is too foul to mention; there's no entring
into the Particulars; it would offend the
Ears of all tho&s;e that have the lea&s;t Pretence
to Mode&s;ty. Some of our worthy Neighbours
will indeed, on this very Score, pa&s;s unreproved,
and the filthy Circum&s;tances not be animad|verted
upon, becau&s;e they cannot be mentioned;
but it is &s;o, it cannot be helped, &s;o they mu&s;t
e&s;cape.</P>
<P>I have the Honour to conver&s;e with &s;ome
Gentlemen &s;o ab&s;tenious, that they are able to
clear them&s;elves of this Charge; and 'tis to
<PB N="320" REF="336">
their Honour that I mention it; though, but in
general, Sir <HI>W&mdash;G&mdash;,</HI> and his Lady, have
treated one another always with &s;uch Ju&s;tice,
and with &s;uch Re&s;erve in this Ca&s;e, that as &s;oon
as ever the Lady has found her &s;elf with Child,
&s;he always lodged in Apartments by her &s;elf,
till &s;he was delivered, and the like at other Sea|&s;ons;
that no Occa&s;ion might offer, where there
was &s;o much Love, to have any exce&s;s.</P>
<P>NOR has this mode&s;t Cu&s;tom been &s;o much a
Stranger to our Ance&s;tors, as it &s;eems to have
been to us; a Truth not at all to our Advan|tage;
this was, without doubt, the Original
of that good Cu&s;tom among Per&s;ons of Qua|lity,
and of any tolerable Fortunes, to have
&s;eparate Apartments, the Gentleman's Lodg|ings
and the Lady's being &s;eparate, &s;o that,
when Decency required, they went from one
another for a while, till proper Times return|ed,
and made Lodging together rea&s;onable
again.</P>
<P>IT is true, middling Families have not this
Convenience, and cannot keep &s;eparate Lodg|ings
furni&s;hed for one another; it may be &s;aid
of &s;uch indeed, that they have the greater ex|erci&s;e
for their Virtue, becau&s;e they are obliged
always to lodge together. But how great &s;o|ever
the Exerci&s;e is, and how difficult foever
to be put in Practice, &s;till, as it is a Virtue, it
ought to be &s;trictly ob&s;erved; nor, in my
Opinion, can any Man be &s;aid to live a Life
of Virtue that neglects it.</P>
<P>THE re&s;t is all Pro&s;titution; nay, 'tis wor&s;e,
'tis unnatural, 'tis a kind of le&s;&s;er <HI>Sodomy;</HI> for,
I doubt not, but <HI>Sodom</HI>'s Sins, the Foundation
of which was laid, as I have ob&s;erved, in high
feeding, emphatically expre&s;s'd in the &s;acred
<PB N="321" REF="337">
Text by <HI>Fulne&s;s of Bread,</HI> &s;o the Con&s;equences
broke out in divers other Exce&s;&s;es, be&s;ides that
one dete&s;table Crime, which bears the Name and
Reproach of the Place to this Day. Their gor|ged
Stomachs di&s;covered them&s;elves, no doubt,
in all the Exce&s;&s;es of a provoked Appetite, and
an inflamed Blood; and it is &s;o, in like Ca&s;es,
to this Day.</P>
<P>WE have a Te&s;timony of this in all Places,
and, I may &s;ay, in all Ages of the World: The
high Feeders are the high Livers; exce&s;s of
Wine is de&s;cribed in Scripture to produce exce&s;s
of Vice, and the Fire of Nature burns in pro|portion
to the Fewel. Hence the <HI>Italians,</HI> a
Nation who revel in all the Varieties of Lux|ury,
&s;uch as rich Wines, lu&s;cious Fruits, high
Sauces, Pickles, Pre&s;erves, Sweet-meats, and
Perfumes, to an Exce&s;s. How do the helli&s;h
Fires rage in them? How do they run out to all
the Extremes of criminal. Riot, even to that
Fury of Love, called Jealou&s;y, and this often
ending in Blood? How do they dwell in Wan|tonne&s;s
and La&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s, and carry it on to
all the mo&s;t unnatural Extremes of the dead
Lake it &s;elf, and this not only now, but in the
<HI>Romans</HI> Time al&s;o it was the like.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame time the more moderate feed|ing
Nations round them, are in proportion, le&s;s
outrageous in their Vice, and whether it be
from any Principle of Virtue or no, they are
&s;o by the meer Con&s;equence of Things; they
live more &s;paringly; and their Blood is kept
lower, not always inflamed (as is the Ca&s;e in
<HI>Italy,</HI> and other Parts of the World); they are
forbid Wine, which to the&s;e Northern Climates
is the Fewel of outrageous Actions, and leads to
innumerable Crimes.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="338">
How ea&s;ily then is this &s;candalous Exce&s;s to
be cured? They have very little regard to Mo|de&s;ty,
to the demands of their Rea&s;on or of
Religion, who will not reduce them&s;elves to a
moderate Degree of Heat, in order to mortify
&s;uch criminal De&s;ires as the&s;e; if a little
abatement of Wine, or of &s;trong nouri&s;hing
and rich Diets, and feeding more &s;paringly,
would do it, they mu&s;t have no de&s;ire to live
within Bounds, like Chri&s;tians, and like Men,
who will not abate a little at the Trencher, that
they may be able to abate in another Place.</P>
<P>GLUTTONY and Drunkenne&s;s are too near
a-kin to the Debaucheries of Love, as they may
well be &s;tiled, not to be called the Parents of
the Vice. If you re&s;train the Original, you
cut off the &s;equent Crime; if the Springs are
cut off, the Streams will &s;oon fail; if the Foun|tains
are &s;topt, the Rivers will &s;oon be dry;
and they that will not &s;uffer &s;o &s;mall a Morti|fication
as the denying them&s;elves a little in
the exce&s;&s;es of the Table and the Bottle, in
order to abate &s;ome of the more criminal Ex|ce&s;&s;es
in the other Place, loudly tells us, they
are in love with the Crime, that they are
pleas'd with the Vice; and that it is not that
they cannot re&s;train them&s;elves, but that, de|lighting
in the vile Part, they don't de&s;ire to
re&s;train them&s;elves, or to be re&s;trained; that
they will not remove the Fewel, le&s;t the Fire
&s;hould abate: Thus one Exce&s;s follows another;
a Debauchery of one kind follows the Debauch|ery
of another; the Matrimonial Whoredom
follows the Drunkenne&s;s and the Gluttony, by
the &s;ame Nece&s;&s;ity, and as naturally as tho
Con&s;equence follows the Cau&s;e; the Influx oc|ca&s;ions
the Efflux, and the Man is but the
<PB N="323" REF="339">
&s;ame; he is a Voluntier in both, a willing Ser|vant
to the Devil, and de&s;ires not to be deliver|ed
from the plea&s;ing nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>I am the longer upon it here, as I &s;aid be|fore,
becau&s;e indeed 'tis the &s;ame thing in all
the other wicked things I have mentioned in
this Work. Whence comes all the indecent law|ful
Things we have been talking of, but from
this Sin of <HI>Sodom, (viz.) Fulne&s;s of Bread?</HI>
while the Stomach is gorged with animal Food,
of which no Nation in the World feeds like us;
while the Blood is filled with the&s;e pungent
Particles, and the Veins &s;welled with animal
Spirits, no wonder the &s;eminal Ve&s;&s;els are over
full, and &s;ummon the Man to a Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion or
Evacuation, even at the Price of his Virtue, of
his Con&s;cience, and of his Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>LET them that are truly de&s;irous to prevent
this unhappy eruption of Con&s;equences, begin
in the right Place; abate the fir&s;t Mi&s;chief; let
them remove the cau&s;ing Evil, and the con&s;e|quent
Evil will die of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>A Mortification of the Palate would be an
effectual Reformation upon the Life; by a
due Regimen of Diet we might bring our
&s;elves to be a reformed regular Nation; and I
&s;ee no other Way ever to bring it to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>WE are ruined in our Morals by lawful
Things; the Exce&s;&s;es in our lawful Enjoy|ments
make them criminal; even our
needful Supplies of Life are the ruin of Life.
We not only dig our Graves with our Teeth,
by mingling our Di&s;ea&s;es with our Food, nou|ri&s;hing
Di&s;temper and Life together, but we
even eat our Way into Eternity, and damn
our Souls with our Teeth; gnawing our
Way through the Doors of the Devil's Ca&s;tle
<PB N="324" REF="340">
with our Teeth. In a word, the Drunkard
may be well &s;aid to drink him&s;elf to the Devil;
the nice eating Glutton feeds and fattens him&s;elf
up for the Devil's Slaughter-hou&s;e; becau&s;e one
Vice feeds another till they are made ripe for
Hell, by the di&s;tracted U&s;e of lawful and lau|dable
Things; making lawful and even nece&s;|&s;ary
Things criminal and &s;owing the Seeds
of Vice in the ordinary Ploughings of meer
Nature.</P>
<P>HOW u&s;efully might we apply this to our
particular Friends, of whom &s;o many will
&s;trive to Blu&s;h, when they read it. <HI>A&mdash;L&mdash;,</HI>
E&s;q; had never been a Whore-ma&s;ter if
he had not din'd &s;o often at <HI>Puntack</HI>'s; nor had
good and grave Sir <HI>L&mdash;W&mdash;,</HI> vi&s;ited <HI>Tabby
R&mdash;,</HI> by Moon-light, if he had not dwelt
&s;o many dark Evenings at <HI>Brown</HI>'s; &s;o he goes
from the Bottle to the Bawdy-hou&s;e; in which
the Man may be &s;aid only to act Nature, and
pur&s;ue, as all the World does, the direct Cour&s;e
of Cau&s;e and Con&s;equence.</P>
<P>IF <HI>G&mdash;W&mdash;</HI> will cea&s;e to make his Hou&s;e
a Stews, his Marriage-Bed a Pollution, and
bring his mode&s;t Wife to a nece&s;&s;ity of turn|ing
her Slipper the wrong Side upward at him,
if he will be able to give a better Excu&s;e for his
Matrimonial Whoredom, than that he can't help
it; let him cea&s;e to eat three Hours together at
Breakfa&s;t; let him not gorge <HI>at Noon</HI> till he
falls a&s;leep at the Table, or drink <HI>at Night</HI>
till he lies under it; let him read <HI>Cornaro</HI>
of <HI>Venice,</HI> and live upon two Ounces and five
Drams a Day, and half a Pint of Wine in
three Days; I'll an&s;wer for it, his Wife &s;hall
not lock her &s;elf up for fear of coming to Bed
to a Fury, nor &s;wear the Peace again&s;t him to
<PB N="325" REF="341">
get him bound to the Behaviour of a Chri&s;tian,
for fear of being murthered in the lawful Me|thod
of Man and Wife.</P>
<P>MADMEN by Day will be Madmen by
Night; they that have no government of
them&s;elves one Way, how &s;hould they have it
another Way? I expect it will be objected here,
that the Nations which I have named, &s;uch as
the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moors,</HI> though they drink no
Wine, and do not feed, as we do, upon Fle&s;h,
yet are as wicked and vitious as other Peo|ple.</P>
<P>THAT tho&s;e Nations are vitious, may be
true; and having no Laws of Con&s;cience or
Religion to re&s;train them, they are, no doubt,
much the wor&s;e. But yet I deny one Part,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) that they are &s;o privately wicked, &s;o
<HI>(lawfully Lewd)</HI> as I call it, <HI>as we are;</HI> they have
their many Wives, as they will, but not &s;o much
conjugal Lewdne&s;s as, I believe, we have; and
I have many Rea&s;on to think &s;o.</P>
<P>THE Subject of this Chapter is indeed ONE,
but have I not given twenty In&s;tances of Ma|trimonial
Whoredom in the compa&s;s of this
Work? Is not the common ordinary Cour&s;e of
our married <HI>loo&s;e Ones,</HI> a Series of mo&s;t &s;canda|lous
Doings; &s;uch and of &s;uch a Kind, as the
<HI>Mahometans</HI> and <HI>Savages,</HI> who have no guide but
Nature, no check but the aver&s;ions of common
Sen&s;e, would abhor?</P>
<P>OF the &s;ame Nature with this, is that of a
Man coming to his Wife after Child-bearing, and
before her Body be &s;ufficiently clean&s;ed from its
natural Impurities; before the Sea&s;ons &s;et apart
for her proper Purgations are fini&s;hed. This is an
Article to be lightly touch'd too, becau&s;e (for|&s;ooth)
we will not bear to be &s;poken plainly to, of
<PB N="326" REF="342">
the Things, which we yet are openly and &s;hame|le&s;ly
guilty of.</P>
<P>THIS is one of the Breaches Mankind
make in their ordinary Practice, not upon the
Laws of Decency only, but upon the Law of
Nature; for the Separation is evidently directed
by the Law of Nature; 'tis dictated from the
fir&s;t Principles of that Knowledge which the
mo&s;t Ignorant are furni&s;hed with of them-&s;elves.</P>
<P>THE Women indeed ought to be the Con|&s;ervators
of this Law; and as they &s;eem to
have a kind of ab&s;olute Power over them&s;elves
during their ordinary Separations, they &s;eem to
be the mo&s;t chargeable with the Breach of it;
becau&s;e they are not altogether &s;o Pa&s;&s;ive at
this time as at another.</P>
<P>IF there is a Breach of Mode&s;ty here, 'tis
on her Side chiefly, and therefore the Reproof
is to her, and ought to be &s;o taken; for it is as
notorious a Charge upon her, as that of admitting
a Man, upon Promi&s;e of Matrimony, before it
was formed into a Marriage; which indeed,
tho' the aggre&s;&s;ing was chargeable upon the
Man, yet the yielding or con&s;enting which
was wholly upon the Woman's Side, and in her
Power, plainly makes her chargeable with the
Offence, makes it all her own Act and Deed;
&s;o it is here; and the therefore it is true, that the
Crime is her's, and the Reproof is upon her,
and upon her only.</P>
<P>THE Law of GOD, in the publick In&s;titu|tion
of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> OEconomy, &s;tates this Ca&s;e
with re&s;pect to the Woman's Separation after
Child-bearing in &s;uch a manner, as that tho'
the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Con&s;titutions, being aboli&s;hed, do
not &s;eem to be binding to us, yet they are cer|tainly
<PB N="327" REF="343">
a ju&s;t Rule for us to &s;tate a Chri&s;tian
Regimen or Government from; they are a good
Standard to mea&s;ure Decency and the Laws of
good Order by: They were certainly formed
upon the mo&s;t perfect Model of Ju&s;tice and
Equity, perfectly &s;uited to the Nature of the
Thing, and are binding in Decency, if they are
not ab&s;olutely &s;o in Con&s;cience, and under the
u&s;ual Penalties, as the re&s;t of GOD's Law at
that time was.</P>
<P>MOST of the &s;acred Con&s;titutions of the
<HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> State were enjoyn'd upon the &s;evere&s;t
Penalty, generally of Death; being cut off
from the Congregation of the LORD, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and
among&s;t tho&s;e Things to which tho&s;e Severities
were annexed, tho&s;e which re&s;pected Unclean|ne&s;s,
and natural or accidental Pollutions, were
&s;ome of the chief; &s;uch as having the Di&s;ea&s;e
of the Lepro&s;y, I&s;&s;ues of Blood, nay, even
eating leavened Bread in the &s;even Days of
the Pa&s;&s;over; counter&s;eiting the &s;acred Oil and
the &s;acred Per&s;ume, were puni&s;hed with Death,
<HI>that Soul was to be cut off,</HI>&amp;c. the Rea&s;on was,
becau&s;e it was a de&s;pi&s;ing the Legi&s;lator. But
when he comes to enjoyn the needful Purifi|cations,
and the particular Uncleanne&s;&s;es
which were to be purg'd by wa&s;hings and &s;epa|rations,
as al&s;o for the eating of Blood, the
Rea&s;ons are given in plain Words; GOD &s;peaks
them him&s;elf, <HI>I have &s;eparated you from other
People that ye &s;hould be mine, and ye &s;hall be holy
unto me;</HI> as in <HI>Exodus,</HI> chap. xii. and <HI>Leviticus,</HI>
chap. xv. and xvii. and &s;everal other Places.</P>
<P>NOW if the&s;e legal Purifications were ap|pointed
only that the People might be a more
exactly clean and &s;anctified People, than the
other Nations about them, the Rea&s;on holds,
<PB N="328" REF="344">
tho' the Sanction of that particular Con&s;titution
is ceas'd, as in other Ca&s;es; for example, the
Law for the Man who had tre&s;pa&s;s'd upon his
Neighbour, cheated or deceived him, was made
to appoint a Sacrifice to attone for the Crime,
and re&s;titution for the Tre&s;pa&s;s; the Crime is
&s;till the &s;ame, though the manner of making an
atonement for it is cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>THE Uncleanne&s;s is the &s;ame, whether the
Law be in force or no. By the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> In&s;titu|tion,
the Woman was to perform her Separa|tion,
or, what was then called a Purification,
a certain time; upon her bringing forth a Male
Child, &s;he performed an exact <HI>Quarentine, viz.</HI>
three and thirty Days, and &s;even Day; and
for a Female Child &s;he was obliged to perform
a double <HI>Quarentine,</HI> namely, &s;ixty and &s;ix
Days, and fourteen Days; during which time
the Man was not to be &s;uffered to come near her,
or &s;o much as to touch her, upon the &s;evere&s;t
Penalties, as above.</P>
<P>NOW, not to in&s;i&s;t upon the legal Purificati|ons
of that &s;trict Law, enjoyned from above, and
which had &s;uch &s;olid Rea&s;ons given for it; yet
the Law of Nature, upon which all that Part is
originally founded, is the &s;ame. You may &s;ay,
the neglect of it is not a mortal Sin, or that
de&s;erves Death. But you cannot &s;ay it is not
a <HI>Pudor,</HI> a &s;hameful, an immode&s;t Thing, or
that it is not loath &s;ome and odious, even in its
own Nature; for the Regulation of clean and
unclean, like right and wrong, is &s;till the &s;ame,
&s;ettled and unalterable, as Things e&s;tabli&s;hed in
the Law of Nature, which are not altered by
Cu&s;toms and Habits; whether good or evil.</P>
<P>IT is true, that our U&s;age has reduced the&s;e
Separations and Purgations of the Sex to a
<PB N="329" REF="345">
Month or thirty Days, which the Law of GOD
had fixed at &s;ix Weeks; and has made no dif|ference
in the time of the Separation between
the Circum&s;tances of a Male or Female Birth;
for all which we give phy&s;ical Rea&s;ons, &s;uch as
generally &s;atisfy our Scruples in tho&s;e Affairs;
nor is it my Bu&s;ine&s;s to di&s;pute here the Rea&s;on
and Nature of the Alteration, and whether it
is &s;ufficiently grounded. Our Phy&s;icians and
Anatomi&s;ts are be&s;t able to an&s;wer for that Part,
and, I &s;uppo&s;e, can do it.</P>
<P>BUT even, with all the abatement of Days;
and I doubt not 'tis reduced as low as it can be,
yet, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> with that abatement we find it is
not ob&s;erved; our Libertine Age breaks thro'
it all, and, if it were a Fortnight, would per|haps
do the &s;ame; and this is the Thing I com|plain
of; and for want of which Decency, or
Duty rather, People of this Age may be ju&s;tly
&s;aid to de&s;erve the Cen&s;ure which a Wife and
good Man put lately upon them, namely, that
we have not le&s;s Holine&s;s than our Ance&s;tors,
nor le&s;s Hone&s;ty, but much more; only that
he thought the Holine&s;s and the Hone&s;ty
of the Days differed, and that &s;ome Things
would pa&s;s now for Holine&s;s and for Hone&s;ty
with us; which would not pa&s;s for &s;uch with our
Ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>THIS indeed may alter the Ca&s;e very much,
and the Ages may differ in the Species when
they do not differ in the Name of the Things;
the Standard of Virtue may alter as the Stand|ard
of our Coins frequently do; but the real
thing, the Silver, and its intrin&s;ick Rate or Va|lue
alters not, 'tis always the &s;ame, and ever
will be.</P>
<P><PB N="330" REF="346">
TO bring it down to the Ca&s;e in hand.
Virtue and Mode&s;ty were Things our Ance&s;tors
had to value them&s;elves upon in a particular
manner; and indeed they had a great Share of
them, &s;uch as they might ju&s;tly value them|&s;elves
upon. Now we may boa&s;t, I hope, of Vir|tue
and Hone&s;ty, in Quantity, as much as they,
and, I believe, we do talk as loudly of it as
ever they did; but whether our Virtue and our
Hone&s;ty are of as fine a Standard or not, I dare
not enter upon a nice enquiry into that Part,
for &s;undry good Rea&s;ons, not &s;o fit perhaps to
mention, as we might wi&s;h they were.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES I am afraid there is a ba&s;er
Alloy among us, and that the Species is a little
altered (in the&s;e Ages of Mirth and good Feed|ing);
I won't venture to &s;ay it is not &s;o. But
even in the Particular before me, I have been told,
our Forefathers were &s;tricter in their adhering to
the Laws of Nature than we think our &s;elves
obliged to be; that they abhorred the Pollutions
that I complain of, and that they left us their
Po&s;terity, much a founder and healthier Gene|ration
for that very thing, perhaps, than we
may leave tho&s;e that are to come after us.</P>
<P>IT is a very unhappy Ca&s;e, that the&s;e Prac|tices
&s;hould affect Po&s;terity &s;o much as they &s;ay
they do, becau&s;e whether we con&s;ider it &s;o
much as we might do or not; I cannot doubt
but our Children will be touch'd in their
Health and Con&s;titution a little, if it be but
a little, by the corrupt Practices of this lewd
Age. What we bring upon our &s;elves is no|thing
but to our &s;elves, and we might be apt
to &s;ay, we alone &s;hould &s;uffer for it; and it
were well if it were no otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="347">
BUT to forfeit for our Po&s;terity, to entail
Di&s;ea&s;es upon the Blood of our Succe&s;&s;ors, to
&s;end them into the World with aching Heads,
rheumatick Joints, entailed Di&s;ea&s;es, inflamed
Blood, and affected Nerves, and cau&s;e them, <HI>as
we may &s;ay,</HI> to come WEEPING into the World,
and go GROANING out of it; this would give
a con&s;idering Mind a Pang of Remor&s;e, and
make us anticipate our Children's Sorrows a
little, by fighing for them &s;ometimes before
they are born.</P>
<P>LIFE at be&s;t brings Sorrows enough with it,
and we need not &s;eem to be concerned left our
Children &s;hould not have their &s;hare of them;
they will bring Evils of that kind enough
(and fa&s;t enough too) upon them&s;elves; we
have no need to &s;end them into time with an
Inheritance of crippled Joints, and aching
Bones, and take care to give them cau&s;e to
cur&s;e their Fathers and Mothers, as many do
every Day.</P>
<P>I make no doubt but the Intemperance and
Exce&s;&s;es I have &s;poken of in this Chapter, have
&s;ometimes de&s;cended from Line to Line to the
third and fourth Generation; and that many
of the Mi&s;eries of Life are owing to the in|fected
Blood of tho&s;e that went before them:
And let &s;uch People reflect &s;eriou&s;ly upon
the Number of Children born into the World
in this luxurious, intemperate vitious Age,
and in this City in particular, who die in the
very Infancy of their Life, who coming into
the World loaded with Di&s;tempers, the effect
of their Parents Intemperance and unnatu|ral
Exce&s;&s;es, &s;truggle a few Days with the un|equal
Burthen of Life, and expire under the
Weight of it.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="348">
IT is but within a few Days that I have &s;een
Examples of this kind, in Families within the
reach of a little enquiry. One has four Chil|dren
left out of twenty-four; another two out
of eighteen; another three out of twenty-two;
and &s;o of many more; whereas <HI>T&mdash;C&mdash;,</HI> a
Man of Virtue and Temperance, within the
reach of my own Acquaintance, has had thir|teen
Children, and never buried one; but at
ninety Years of Age &s;ees them all grown Men
and Women, healthy, &s;trong, fruitful, and full
of Children of their own.</P>
<P><HI>G&mdash;D&mdash;,</HI> another antient, grave, and re|ligious
Gentleman, had but four Children, his
Wife dying young, and him&s;elf living &s;ingle
afterwards to a great Age, &s;aw tho&s;e four, be|ing
all Daughters, bring forth ju&s;t eighty Chil|dren,
and had at one time One hundred and
thirteen of his Children, Grand-Children and
Great Grand-Children, dining with him at his
Table.</P>
<P>THESE are &s;ome of the Examples of Tempe|rance
and Mode&s;ty, which a&s;&s;i&s;t to a &s;trong
Con&s;titution, who&s;e Vigour extended in the
Cour&s;e of Nature, multiplies much more than
the Heats of an outrageous Flame, and leaves
a Tincture of Health and vigorous Spirits upon
their Po&s;terity; whereas a tainted Soul, cor|rupting
the Ma&s;s of Blood with Vice and
Lewdne&s;s, brings a Generation of di&s;ea&s;ed and
di&s;tempered Animals, fit to be &s;ent to an Ho&s;|pital,
Cradle and all; and calling for Phy&s;ici|ans,
and the help of Art, even before they can
be fairly &s;aid to live.</P>
<P>IT is true, I do not place this all to the Ac|count
of the two particular Branches of Intem|perance
and Exce&s;s only, which are mentioned
<PB N="333" REF="349">
in this Chapter, but to the whole practice of
immode&s;t and indedecent Actions, the product of
extravagant De&s;ires, mentioned in the Chapters
foregoing; for being now at the clo&s;e of the
Account, (and 'tis time I were, for it is a black
Account indeed) the Application refers to the
whole, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the general Immode&s;ty of the Day,
as practi&s;ed among married People, and pleaded
for, vindicated and defended, under the cover
and protection of the facred Office, and under
the pretence of being lawful, becau&s;e within
the Bounds of Matrimony.</P>
<P>NOR do I pretend that I have yet gone
through all the Branches of this dirty Practice;
the Wickedne&s;s is di&s;per&s;ed among a va&s;t vari|ety
of Cau&s;es and Circum&s;tances, as it is a|mong
abundance of People; not a Back-door,
but the courrpt Blood, the Offspring of a cor|rupt
Race &s;ally out at, and which Way &s;oever
you look, you may &s;ee daily new Indecencies,
not only acted but contrived, &s;tudied and found
out, in order to gratify the Vice, and lay us
open to the Scourage of the Satyr.</P>
<P>IT is time to combat an Evil that is thus
growing upon us, and that encroaches under the
Protection of &s;o many &s;pecious and plau&s;ible
Out&s;ides: One pleads Nature, another Law,
another Nece&s;&s;ity, all of them Things that
have their additional Pretences as hard to an|&s;wer
as the Offenders pretend they are to re|&s;i&s;t.
It is not ea&s;ie to per&s;uade them that
they offend; and if they &s;eem to be convinced
that they do, 'tis yet with &s;uch Extenuations,
&s;uch Excu&s;es, and &s;uch appararent Inclinations
to continue the Practice, that there is &s;carce
room to hope for any Amendment.</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="350">
COU'D we but conquer the avow'd open de|fending
the&s;e Practices, it would be a great
Point gain'd; Men would ca&s;e to in&s;i&s;t
upon the Ju&s;tification of it, or to boa&s;t in the
Facts: Could we but per&s;uade them not to pub|li&s;h
their own Shame, but to cea&s;e valuing
them&s;elves upon what they ought to blu&s;h at,
this would give &s;ome room to hope for a Refor|mation
of the Practice; we might promi&s;e our
&s;elves, that what they were once a&s;hamed of
they might perhaps, in time, think of reform|ing;
at lea&s;t, it wou'd be a Step towards it.
But how &s;hall we &s;uppo&s;e <HI>L</HI>&mdash;<HI>G</HI>&mdash;, of
&mdash;<HI>&s;hire,</HI> E&s;&abque; or his eminent Neighbour the
J&mdash;ce, &s;hould quit the Crimes which they
meet without fail twice a Week to contem|plate
of, committing them over again in
Imagination, lea&s;t they &s;hould not be guilty
enough, and forming and accumulated Guilt in
their Souls, a Guilt which few People are
wicked enough to under&s;tand, (<HI>viz.</HI>) once in
the Fact, and again in the Reflection; in|&s;tead
of Repentance, commiting the Crime
again in the Mind, by thinking it over with
Delight.</P>
<P>THESE are Proficients in the Art of Sin|ning,
that knowing how to offend in the mo&s;t
exqui&s;ite manner, are &s;o far from Repentance,
that, if they have any regret at all, it is that
they know not how to be wickeder than they
are, but rejoyce over the Opportunities they
have, and wi&s;h for more.</P>
<P>RATHER than not be wicked, they will run
lawful Things up to a criminal Exce&s;s, and
make them&s;elves Offenders when they need
not.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="351">
THIS is &s;uch a kind of plea&s;ure in Crime, &s;&s;ch
a fondne&s;s of doing Evil, that I am per&s;uaded
the Devil does not come up to; the Devil does
not commit Sinas a plea&s;ure, but with other and
farther Views, &s;uch as affronting GOD his &s;upreme
Governor, and who he hates on innumerable Ac|counts;
ruining Man, the &s;ubject of his Envy;
le&s;&s;ening the Authority of Heaven, and counter|acting
divine Providence; and &s;uch other hel|li&s;h
Ends and Rea&s;ons, for which he exerts
him&s;elf in Crime to the utmo&s;t; and the Plea|&s;ure
the Devil takes in Crime is no otherwi&s;e,
but more or le&s;s, as it an&s;wers &s;ome of the&s;e
helli&s;h De&s;igns, and aims at more.</P>
<P>BUT my accurate Friend the 'Squire&mdash;,
plea&s;es him&s;elf in the meer Crime, laughs in
the Satisfaction he finds in the very Enjoyment
of Vice; like a Man that would Blow up a
Hou&s;e, and the whole Family in it, for the
meer Satisfaction of hearing the Bounce; and
plea&s;e him&s;elf with it afterward, upon the
meer Plea&s;e of &s;eeing the innocent Wife and
Children fly up in the Air, and be da&s;h'd in
Pieces with the Fall.</P>
<P>THE Fact is not &s;o bloody and cruel indeed,
but the Principle is the &s;ame; he that can look
back upon a hundred Adulteries, and act them
all over again in his Imagination, with the &s;ame
Plea&s;ure as before, wi&s;hing for Occa&s;ions to
commit a hundred more. I appeal to the learned
Divines, who know what the meaning of that
Text is, <HI>has committed Adultery with her already
in his Heart,</HI> Matth. v. 28. whether &s;uch a Man
is not really, tho' not actually, guilty of three
hundred Adultreries, putting them all together.</P>
<P>IT is a particular Snare to the&s;e Men, in
the Ca&s;e I am upon, that they &s;ay the Crime
<PB N="336" REF="352">
they are thus daily committing is no Crime,
much le&s;s Adultery, and that it has a Cover
for it, which they make their Refuge, and
under the Protection of which, they run out
into all the&s;e Extravagancies with a kind of
quietne&s;s and &s;atisfaction upon their Soul, that
is not ea&s;ily to be de&s;cribed; this Covering is
the Article of Marriage, the very Thing I am
upon, and 'tis upon this very Account that this
whole Book is written.</P>
<P>IT is under the Cover of Marriage, that the&s;e
Exce&s;&s;es and Immode&s;ties are committed. But
under what Protection are they committed over
again with the Tongue, boa&s;ting and talking
lewdly of the Extravagancies they have com|mitted?
Of which I have this double Charge to
lay again&s;t them, (<HI>viz.</HI>) In the fir&s;t they &s;inn'd
with their Wives; in the &s;econd without their
Wives; nay, to carry it farther, in the fir&s;t
they &s;inn'd again&s;t Heaven, in the &s;econd a|gain&s;t
the &s;acred Ordinance of Marriage, and a|gain&s;t
the Wife al&s;o.</P>
<P>AND not to leave them room to Cavil at the
Expre&s;&s;ion, I explain and in&s;i&s;t upon it, that a
decent concealing the conjugal Freedoms be|tween
a Man and his Wife, is a Debt due to
Mode&s;ty as a Virtue, and to the Wife as &s;he is
a Woman. He that expo&s;es tho&s;e Things de|&s;erves
no more the Name of a rational Creature,
much le&s;s of a Man of Mode&s;ty, nay, hardly
of a Man. In a word, he Sins again&s;t his Wife,
and expo&s;es him&s;elf, and the la&s;t mo&s;t abomi|nably.</P>
<P>NOR will his Marriage cover either of the&s;e
Crimes, but rather aggravate them, for, as I
&s;aid, he Sins again&s;t the very Marriage it &s;elf:
Marriage is a Contract of Liberty to lawful
<PB N="337" REF="353">
Things; but Marriage is no Protection for
Crime; Marriage covers the Bed undefiled,
and makes it pure and honourable. But the
Man may pollute even his Marriage-Bed, and
when he does &s;o, he makes that criminal which
would otherwi&s;e be lawful.</P>
<P>THUS unnatural Crimes may be acted in the
Marriage-Bed; and will any Man &s;ay, it is no
Sin becau&s;e it is under the Cover of Marriage;
the Woman may be ravi&s;h'd in the Marriage|Bed,
and the Man de&s;erve the Gallows for
Crimes offer'd to his own Wife. Let &s;uch con|&s;ider
of it, le&s;t the Woman <HI>turn the Slipper up
again&s;t them,</HI> and lea&s;t they be expo&s;ed as they
de&s;erve.</P>
<P>AS Matrimony is no Protection for unnatu|ral
Vices, &s;o neither is it for indecent Exce&s;&s;es
and Immode&s;ties; and as for the Plea&s;ure they
take in the contemplation of what was crimi|nal
in the committing, as it is doubling the
Offence, &s;o it is with the addition of &s;omething
unnatural in it al&s;o. In a word, talking Lewd|ly,
according to a known Author, is infamous,
but talking lewdly of conjugal Actions is un|natural
and odious; 'tis a kind of a <HI>Sodomy</HI> of
the Tongue; 'tis a Crime that wants a Name,
but 'tis great pity it &s;hould want a Puni&s;hment.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of indecent and untimely Marriages, whe|ther

marrying Infants and Children, or mar|rying
immediately after the Death of the
Husband or Wife that went before.</HEAD>
<P>_THOUGH every Indecency is
not equally criminal, yet every
Thing &s;candalous and offen&s;ive is
really Criminal, as that which
exceeds it in Degree; and there|fore
the Article I am now upon,
though it may not be &s;o odious &s;ingly, and in it
&s;elf &s;eparately, though it is not &s;o much a Ma|trimonial
Whoredom as the pa&s;t Heads I have
mentioned, yet it is Part of the Crime, and in
the Intent and Meaning, the Per&s;ons are as re|ally
guilty as in any of the other.</P>
<P>EVERY thing comes within the Compa&s;s of
what I call Matrimonial Whoredom, wherein
the Marriage is made the meer Cover for a
wicked, ungoverned &s;en&s;ual De&s;ire. Marriage
is the Re&s;ult of a pure Flame; 'tis entring into
a &s;acred Relation with the Ends and Views
which conform to the immediate End and
Rea&s;on of the In&s;titution it &s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="355">
As it is an Ordinance of GOD, its original
is Divine, the rea&s;on of it good, the nature of
it &s;acred; and it ought to be pre&s;erved in its
Purity, not debauched by the corrupt Inclina|tions
of Men, and made a Tool to a vitious
ungoverned Appetite.</P>
<P>THIS is the Ca&s;e when any Excur&s;ions are
made out of the ordinary Road of tho&s;e two
obligatory Articles, which I mentioned at fir&s;t,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) Decency and Mode&s;ty.</P>
<P>TO ru&s;h into Matrimony as a Hor&s;e ru&s;hes
into the Battle, intimates a Fury, not a ratio|nal
&s;ober Chri&s;tian Proceeding; in a word, it
detects the Per&s;on of the Crime I have men|tioned
&s;o often, (<HI>viz.</HI>) a raging inflamed Appe|tite;
let it lie ever &s;o deep, covered with what|&s;oever
Pretences, guilded over however &s;mooth
and &s;hining, let the out&s;ide be as &s;pecious as
you will, the Poi&s;on is lodg'd within, the Ve|nom
of it works in a &s;ecret manner, till it
breaks out in Scandal and Crime.</P>
<P>TAKE it in which Sex you will, the Offence
is the &s;ame; nor do I always yield that it is
wor&s;e in the Woman than in the Man; the
Crime is the &s;ame, and the Obligation to De|cency
is equal; we may load the Woman the
harder, becau&s;e we pretend Mode&s;ty is ever
peculiar, at lea&s;t ought to be &s;o, but I do not
grant it at all. Men indeed make the bolde&s;t
Sallies, and the Men have brought them&s;elves
to a kind of allowing them&s;elves in Crime by
the Authority of Cu&s;tom; but I deny that in
the Original it ought to be &s;o.</P>
<P>A Man ought no more to &s;wear and be drunk,
quarrel and commit murther in his Rage than
a Woman; and the Offence is as great when
he does it. Cu&s;tom only has given Crime
<PB N="340" REF="356">
a more odious Title, where the Woman is the
guilty Per&s;on, becau&s;e it is not expected from
her &s;o much. But is there any Law that &s;hows
us, the Man has more indecent Liberties al|lowed
him than the Woman? Not at all; the
Obligation is the &s;ame, and the Offence the
&s;ame.</P>
<P>ALL indecent Matrimony is mutual, and
the Crime is mutual, the Scandal affects both;
the Woman is as guilty as the Man, and the
Man as the Woman. Suppo&s;e, for example, a
Man having buried his Wife, goes the next
Week, or next Month, or next Day (for 'tis
much alike) to court another Woman. This is
not unlawful, that's true, but 'tis highly inde|cent;
and where lies the Crime? In the Man,
&s;ays Cu&s;tom, becau&s;e he is the Aggre&s;&s;or: But
I deny that there is the lea&s;t Difference in that
Part, for the Woman knows it, and &s;he knows
'tis &s;candalous; Why then does &s;he come into
it? The Crime is hers as much as his. Nay, if
a Breach of Mode&s;ty is greater in the Wo|man
than in the Man, as &s;ome pretend, then
&s;he is the greate&s;t Offender here too, for the
Indecency on her Side is utterly inexcu&s;able.</P>
<P>BUT a Que&s;tion or two returns upon us
here: What is the Indecency that you &s;hould
bring it into the Rank of Matrimonial Whore|dom,
or that the Woman &s;hould be charged
with it? The Indecency is a want of re&s;pect
to the Memory of the Dead, and pray what is
the Woman concerned in that? Perhaps &s;he did
not &s;o much as know her, or had ever &s;een her
in her Life; what then is the Memory of her
to her that comes after?</P>
<P>THE next Que&s;tion is this, Breach of De|cency
is an inva&s;ion of Cu&s;tom only, and this
<PB N="341" REF="357">
Cu&s;tom is a meer Thing of Nothing, an Origi|nal
of no Authority. Matrimony as an Ordi|nance
of GOD, and as &s;acred In&s;titution, Cu|&s;tom
can have nothing to do with that; it is not
binding at all in Law, neither the Laws of GOD
or Man, and what have we to do with that? The
Man is &s;ingle, and the Woman is dead; &s;he is as
really dead as if &s;he had been in her Grave &s;e|ven
Years; nor is there the lea&s;t Injury or In|ju&s;tice
done to her; all the re&s;t is a meer Ho|mage
paid to Cu&s;tom, and which is not at all
its due.</P>
<P>I give this the greater Length becau&s;e 'tis a
popular Argument, and often brought to de|fend
the&s;e &s;udden, ha&s;ty and indecent Marriages
I &s;peak of; and likewife to let you &s;ee, that
though I &s;hould grant every Word of it, yet
my Objection again&s;t the Practice of &s;uch ha&s;ty
Marriages &s;tands good, and the Reproach is the
&s;ame.</P>
<P>FOR, 1. My Objection is not &s;o much a|gain&s;t
the Breach of a Cu&s;tom, as it is again&s;t
a Breach of Mode&s;ty; and if Cu&s;tom only has
made it &s;o, for Cu&s;tom or Crime made Mode&s;ty
a Virtue at fir&s;t, yet &s;ince it is &s;o we are
bound by it &s;o far, as we are to do every thing
which is of good Report, to avoid every thing
that gives offence, and is an occa&s;ion of Re|proach,
though it may in it &s;elf be literally
lawful.</P>
<P>2. BUT my Objection lies chiefly another
Way, and points at another thing; the ha&s;ty
and untimely, or un&s;ea&s;onable Marriages which
I complain of, and which, I &s;ay, are &s;candalous
and criminal, are &s;o, as they di&s;cover them|&s;elves
to be the Effect of a raging, ungo|verned
Appetite, a furious immode&s;t Gu&s;t of
<PB N="342" REF="358">
Sen&s;uality, a Flame of immoderate De|&s;ires.</P>
<P>AS the&s;e are Things which &s;hould be morti|fied
and re&s;trained, not indulged and gratified,
&s;o every indecent untimely Step taken in pur|&s;uit
of this corrupt and vitiated Flame, is a
Crime; and therefore I think a Marriage found|ed
upon this Foot is neither more or le&s;s than a
Matrimonial Whoredom, or at lea&s;t a Degree of
it. 'Tis a criminal Gu&s;t, giving Beginning to a
&s;candalous and indecent Action, which by that
means becomes criminal too, though otherwife
literally lawful; that is, it becomes Matter of
Scandal, and gives offence to others, which is
what, by the Scripture Rule, Chri&s;tians ought
indu&s;triou&s;ly to avoid.</P>
<P>NOW when a Woman, within a Month or
two after her Husband's Death, &s;hall receive
the Addre&s;&s;es of another, or a Man within &s;uch,
or &s;ometimes a &s;horter Time, &s;hall apply him|&s;elf
to a Woman for Matrimony; can this be
&s;uppo&s;ed to be from a mode&s;t Foundation, or
within the compa&s;s of religious Regards? It
cannot be.</P>
<P>MATRIMONY, though it is not &s;o regarded,
is really a religious, &s;acred and divine In&s;titu|tion;
it ought to be taken as &s;uch, and never
undertaken without Regard to its religious
Foundation: So far as it is made a &s;talking
Hor&s;e to a corrupt and ba&s;er De&s;ire, &s;o far as it
is made u&s;e of as a Pretence to cover the vitia|ted
Appetite, give it what fine Words you
will, and guild it over with as many fair Out|&s;ides
as you will, 'tis &s;o far turned into a Ma|trimonial
Whoredom: The Vice is at the Bot|tom,
the Matrimony is enter'd upon meerly to
gratify it, and to plea&s;e the Appetite under
<PB N="343" REF="359">
the Cover of Liberty, and under the Plea of
Law.</P>
<P>IN a Word, all &s;uch Marriages, or &s;uch Mo|tions
to Marriage, where the &s;en&s;ual Part is the
e&s;&s;ential Part, are &s;o far liable to this Charge;
when the Vice, I &s;ay, is the moving Cau&s;e,
and the Ceremony is the Tool to introduce and
colour it; that's what I call legal Wickedne&s;s;
when the Law of Matrimony is made a Key to
the Union of the Bodies more than of the Souls,
opening the Door to the in&s;atiate Appetite,
and covering the Fire of Vice under the legal
In&s;titution. This I call Matrimonial Whore|dom,
and, I think, it merits the Name very
well.</P>
<P>MATRIMONY is a cha&s;t and mode&s;t Scheme
of Living; 'tis a State, not a Circum&s;tance of
Life; the End and Meaning of it is the rai&s;|ing
Families, procreating Children, to be
brought up religiou&s;ly; 'tis an E&s;tabli&s;hment
contracted, or at lea&s;t ought to be &s;o, as an
Appointment of Heaven; and for &s;olid and
&s;ub&s;tantial Enjoyments; it is durable as Life,
and bounded only by the Duration of Life. If
it be enter'd into upon other Foundations, and
&s;o far as it is &s;o engaged in, &s;o far 'tis abu&s;ed
&s;uch are joined together indeed, but not ac|cording
to GOD'S <HI>holy Ordinance;</HI> 'tis debauch|ing
the Ordinance, corrupting the propo&s;ed
End; 'tis a good Means made u&s;e for a bad
End; and as 'tis pur&s;ued with wicked De&s;igns,
'tis &s;o far a wicked Engagement: Such do not
come together like Man and Wife, but like
W&mdash;and R&mdash;; in &s;hort, they come toge|ther
to take their Fill of Crime, and that, made
a Crime by the Manner of it, tho' not in the
Letter of it.</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="360">
As when a Set of Gentlemen make an Ap|pointment
for what they call a Drinking-bout,
they make their Agreement to meet at &s;uch a
Tavern on purpo&s;e: &startq;Tis certainly and literally
lawful for them to meet. Society, and even
Society for diver&s;ion, is lawful and good; but
this is a Meeting meerly to be drunk, meerly
to &s;atisfy the Appetite or Thir&s;t of Wine, and
with an Intention, nay, with a re&s;olved Pur|po&s;e
of being Drunk; and what is to be &s;aid
then of the Meeting it &s;elf? It was a Wicked|ne&s;s
in it &s;elf; 'twas a purpo&s;e to gratify a
vitious Appetite; and &s;o far the very Meeting
it &s;elf was a Crime; 'twas an Act of Debauch|ery;
'twas founded on a thir&s;t of Wine, and a
Thir&s;t not to be quenched but by Exce&s;s and
Intemperance.</P>
<P>THE Parallel is exactly ju&s;t, the Matrimony
contracted in the manner I &s;peak of is ju&s;t
the &s;ame; 'tis founded in Crime, the &s;en&s;ual
Part is the Foundation and Original of it; and
the Matrimony is only the help, the conveni|ence
to bring it to pa&s;s lawfully, as two re|&s;olving
to go over a River to commit a Theft;
the pa&s;&s;$ng the River, and the Robbery, is the
Intent; the Ferry-Boat is only the lawful A|&s;i&s;tant
to an unlawful Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT neither is this all, for it is criminal to
abu&s;e the Ordinance, to turn the &s;acred Ap|pointment
of Heaven to a corrupt and vile
U&s;e, making it the a&s;&s;i&s;tant to Sen&s;uality, and
to gratifying the Fle&s;h, to quenching a di&s;ho|nourable
Flame, which was very far from the
meaning or de&s;ign of the In&s;titution. That
was all pure and upright, &s;ingly and &s;imply,
hone&s;t and clean in every Part and Branch
of it, and cannot without a Crime be
<PB N="345" REF="361">
turned, and applied to gratify uncha&s;t De|&s;ires.</P>
<P>IT is greatly wanted that our Governours
and con&s;tituted Powers &s;hould take notice of
&s;uch Things, and, as far as lies in them, pre|vent
the turning and inverting the End of
the&s;e nice In&s;titutions, that they may not be
apply'd to wrong Purpo&s;es, or debauched by
Men of vitious Inclinations, to &s;uch Ends as
are &s;candalous to Religion, and to humane So|ciety.</P>
<P>'TIS true, it would be hard to make a Re|gulation
which &s;hould &s;uit to every Cir|cum&s;tance
which might happen, and to the
nature of the Thing too; yet &s;omething might
be done; for Example, I think there might be
a Law made which &s;hould limit the Rule of
Decency in the Ca&s;e of &s;econd Marriages, bind|ing
the Parties &s;urviving to a certain Time, in
which it &s;hould not be lawful for the Man or
the Woman to marry after the Death of the
Wife or Husband that went before; and if any
did marry within that Time, it &s;hould be e|&s;teemed
not only unlawful but &s;hameful and
odious, done in meer &s;en&s;uality, and to gratify
the wor&s;t Part, not the Chri&s;tian Part; it
&s;hould, in &s;hort, be a Brand of Infamy on the
Per&s;on, whether Man or Woman, either to
marry, or even to treat of, or about Marriage,
within that Time.</P>
<P>SUCH a Law would, at lea&s;t, di&s;tingui&s;h
People one from another; they would be known
and mark'd out; and if that Law was duly
and exactly executed, the Offence would, in
time, grow out of u&s;e, be really &s;candalous,
no Body would be guilty of it that had
<PB N="346" REF="362">
any Value for their own Character, becau&s;e it
would expo&s;e the Crime, as well as the Fact.</P>
<P>I grant, that the Re&s;pect to the Dead is not
the thing that makes the Crime, but that Re|&s;pect
being a Debt of Decency, why is it not
paid? Let the Rea&s;on be enquired into, the
An&s;wer mu&s;t be natural, becau&s;e the Party has
a &s;ecret Inclination to gratify, and which is to
be obliged in &s;pight of that Pretence. Now all
Matrimony that is meerly enter'd into to gra|ti&s;y
the Inclination, that is undertaken meer|ly
for the &s;en&s;ual Part, is, in my Sen&s;e, a
debauched Matrimony, becau&s;e Sen&s;uality is
not the true End and De&s;ign of the Ordinance
of Matrimony, but a Corruption of it, and an
Abu&s;e.</P>
<P>IT is for the Honour of Matrimony, and to
dignify the Ordinance in a due Manner, that
tho&s;e Things &s;hould be avoided which bring
Scandal upon it, tho' it be but in the Circum|&s;tances,
not the e&s;&s;ential Part: To &s;ee a Couple
come together meerly and openly to gratify
the vitious and Brutal Part, and &s;atisfy their
Sen&s;uality, and then take the &s;acred Name of
GOD in their Mouths, and tell us, they do
come together <HI>according</HI> tO GOD <HI>'S holy Ordi|nance.</HI>
This is making, not a Je&s;t of Religion
only, but 'tis Prophanene&s;s, 'tis turning &s;acred
Things to debauched Purpo&s;es, 'tis giving reli|gious
Titles to corrupt Undertakings, and &s;an
ctifying Crimes by the Mask of Innocence.</P>
<P>LET Prote&s;tants and Chri&s;tians, or tho&s;e who
would be e&s;teemed &s;uch, look back upon the
Purity which they profe&s;s, and no longer &s;tudy
to cover and conceal Crime under the Appear|ance
of Religion, but hone&s;tly explode the vi|tious
Part, and di&s;tingui&s;h rightly between
<PB N="347" REF="363">
Things &s;incere, and Things &s;hameful and hy|pocritical.</P>
<P>WHERE Matrimony is pretended, let it be
as it ought to be, according to its In&s;titution, <HI>ac|cording
to</HI> GOD's <HI>holy Ordinance;</HI> and as after
joining Chri&s;tians are &s;till bound by the Laws
of Decency and Mode&s;ty, let their coming to|gether
be &s;o too; let it be without the Reproach
of Crime, without the Brand of Indecent and
Immode&s;t, which are the Offspring of a mo&s;t
infamous Principle. They that fix the Blame
upon them&s;elves thus at fir&s;t, may depend that
the Brand of it, like burning in the Hand, will
be <HI>Indelible,</HI> the Blot never wears out; what|ever
their Characters are afterward, the Hi&s;tory
is told with this He&s;itation, <HI>But He</HI> or <HI>But She</HI>
did <HI>&s;o or &s;o,</HI> married in a mo&s;t &s;candalous Way,
immediately after the Death of the former
Wife or Husband; and with this Reproach
they mu&s;t be content to go on to their
Graves.</P>
<P>HOW ea&s;ily may People avoid the&s;e Re|proaches?
And how much is it every Chri&s;tian
Man's Duty to avoid them, if po&s;&s;ible? A little
mortifying of the Fle&s;h, <HI>with its Affections and
Lu&s;ts,</HI> would do it, e&s;pecially as to the reli|gious
Part; a little Prudence in re&s;training
their Inclination; a little Government of the
corrupt Flame; a little Concern for Reputa|tion,
for Character, and for the Honour of
Po&s;terity, would &s;mooth the Way; that's the
civil Part.</P>
<P>BUT wretched Conduct! How are all the&s;e
Things laugh'd at? How are all the Obligations
of Decency and Mode&s;ty forgot? When the
Vice prompts, when the &s;en&s;ual Part &s;tirs, the
Voice of Rea&s;on is drown'd and &s;till'd by the
<PB N="348" REF="364">
Clamour of the Sen&s;es; Nature rebels again&s;t
Principle, Vice gets the better of Virtue, and
the wicked Appetite &s;inks all the Re&s;olutions
of Ab&s;tinence and Moderation.</P>
<P>AND what is all this Scandal heap'd up for?
How mean, how &s;ordid a Thing, if it be con|&s;ider'd,
ab&s;tracted from that &s;pecious Pretence?
And what is the Difference betwixt this and
Whoring, if there was not this Refuge of a
&s;candalous Marriage? Would &s;uch Men &s;cruple
quenching the Flame a more irregular Way?
How long would Virtue re&s;train them, if Mo|de&s;ty
and Decency will not? How long will
they be afraid of Crime, that are not afraid
of Scandal?</P>
<P>THE Man, outrageous in his Appetite,
mu&s;t have a Relief, his &s;en&s;ual Part teazes and
importunes him: How long would he hold out
again&s;t it, if there was not this Relief under
the Colour of Law? As if the Letter of the
Law would defend him, where the E&s;&s;ence, the
intent and meaning of the Law is again&s;t
him.</P>
<P>I can never hope for &s;uch a Man, that he
would re&s;train him&s;elf for fear of the Sin, who
will not for fear of the Scandal; e&s;pecially
where the Scandal brings Crime along with it
too: 'Tis a Crime upon him&s;elf; 'tis a Sin a|gain&s;t
him&s;elf, again&s;t his Fame, and again&s;t
his Family and Po&s;terity; it lays an indelible
Blot upon them, and he Brands him&s;elf with
&s;uch a Mark of Infamy, that not only his Chil|dren
after him &s;hall bear a Share of, but &s;uch as
his Children them&s;elves &s;hall reproach him with
in their Turn, and when 'twill be too late for
him to Blu&s;h, if it &s;hould not be too late for
him to Repent of it.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="365">
NOTHING that I know of, at lea&s;t nothing
of the Kind, can be a wor&s;e Blot upon the
Character of a Chri&s;tian, than this of an un|bounded,
ungoverned Sen&s;uality, and of doing
&s;candalous Things from &s;uch a vile Principle.
The Man him&s;elf, or the Woman either, will
be as much a&s;hamed of it, and as much re|proach
them&s;elves afterwards as any Body el&s;e,
unle&s;s the Crime it &s;elf hardens them again&s;t
Shame.</P>
<P>CAPTAIN&mdash;<HI>H</HI>&mdash;, was a noted Offender
of this kind, he was a Commander of a good
Ship, and his Name is now a &s;tanding Prece|dent,
both of the Crime I am &s;peaking of, and
the Penitence; he buried a virtuous, &s;ober,
beautiful Wife, and with a Face of uncon|cerned
Levity, looks immediately round him
for another, even before his fir&s;t Wife was bu|ried.
As the Thought was &s;urprizing and im|pudent,
&s;o he could not expect any Woman of
Mode&s;ty would talk with him upon that Sub|ject;
and as he found he was abhorr'd and
&s;corn'd upon the very mention of it, he &s;eeks
out where he thought he &s;hould not be refu&s;ed;
and that Way he an&s;wered his wicked De&s;ign
immediately; for he married in two Days after
his Wife was buried.</P>
<P>IN an ill Hour, pur&s;uing his vitious Appe|tite,
he &s;ingles out a Woman, <HI>Fool as I was,</HI>
(&s;aid he afterwards). What need I have ask'd
her to marry? If it had been t'other Que&s;tion,
I need not have fear'd a Denial.</P>
<P>IN a word, he marry'd her, lov'd her, lay
with her, and hated her, and all within the
compa&s;s of a Fortnight; in another Fortnight
he went to Sea and left her, and in two Months
more, was ca&s;t away, drown'd, and &s;aw her no
<PB N="350" REF="366">
more; and the Woman marry'd again the next
Day after &s;he heard of it.</P>
<P>THE Man was always (before this Step) lov'd
and e&s;teem'd among his Friends; he pa&s;s'd till
that time for a Man of Virtue and Sobriety;
and, had he thought fit to have &s;ubdued his
vitious Appetite but one Year, or perhaps half
a Year, he had pre&s;erved that Character, and
might have had his Choice of a Wife among
the Ladies in his Neighbourhood; very few
would have refusd him. And this he acknow|ledged
in the hearing of the Per&s;on from whom
I had the Relation.</P>
<P>BUT overjoy'd with the Liberty he had up|on
the change of his Circum&s;tances; quitting a
&s;ick Companion, and left to range the World
for another, he &s;acrificed his Fame to his Sen|&s;uality,
and could not prevail with him&s;elf to
&s;tay, no not a Week; which Precipitation
made him the &s;corn of all about him; and, as
I &s;aid, in le&s;s than a Month he could have hang'd
him&s;elf with the &s;ame &s;atisfaction, compar'd
to what he had in the prepo&s;terous Step he had
taken: But it was too late to look back; he
could never retrieve it. He was indeed a Peni|tent,
as to the Folly of it; and own'd to me
per&s;onally, that it was nothing but meer Ma|trimonial
Whoredom. I u&s;e his own Words;
and it was the very fir&s;t Ca&s;e that put the Pur|po&s;e
of reproving it in this manner, into my
Thoughts.</P>
<P>THE Tragedy of this poor Gentleman was
enough to fill any Man's Mind with a ju&s;t In|dignation
at the Practice; and though we &s;ee
it often done, where perhaps the Con&s;equence is
not &s;o fatal, yet the particular Scandal of it is
not at all le&s;&s;en'd: Had he not found that fa|vourable
<PB N="351" REF="367">
Pa&s;&s;age out of Life, whether in Judg|ment
or in Mercy, GOD alone knows, I know
not what might have been his Fate; for it was
&s;uch a mortification to him to &s;ee him&s;elf &s;o
univer&s;ally de&s;pis'd upon this &s;candalous Occa|&s;ion,
and, as he him&s;elf &s;aid, to de&s;erve it too;
whereas he was, on the contrary, &s;o generally be|loved
before, that it was more than all the Phi|lo&s;ophy
he was Ma&s;ter of could &s;upport.</P>
<P>HE was indeed a <HI>Memento</HI> to his Friends,
and a Warning again&s;t Matrimonial Whore|dom
to all that knew him. I &s;ay nothing of
the Creature he took; &s;he is below our Con&s;i|deration
in the Ca&s;e, becau&s;e &s;he had no Cha|racter,
no Virtue to expo&s;e.</P>
<P>ALL the Argument this unfortunate Per&s;on
had to excu&s;e him&s;elf was, that he was loth to
go to a Whore; but he was horribly a&s;ham'd to
mention it; nor did he &s;peak &s;o but to his very
intimate Friends, of whom I was one. But he
repented heartily of that Caution, and own'd
to us, that he believ'd his Sin was as great, and
e&s;pecially, as he &s;aid, the Scandal was greater.
Nor did he think him&s;elf le&s;s guilty of Whore|dom
for the formality of the Marriage; and I
am to acknowledge that it was from this Man,
and from his Penitentials, that, as above, I had
the very Words which I make the Title of this
Work, and which I have on &s;o many Occa&s;ions
repeated, (<HI>viz.</HI>) Matrimonial Whoredom.</P>
<P>FROM this &s;ad Hi&s;tory in a Man, whom I e|&s;teemed
as a Man of Worth, and for that Rea|&s;on
e&s;teemed his Story as con&s;iderable, I might
proceed to give flagrant Examples of the like
&s;candalous Matches, and from the like unju&s;ti|fiable
Principle, but without the like penitent
<PB N="352" REF="368">
Acknowledgment; &s;uch is the famous <HI>B</HI>&mdash;
<HI>B</HI>&mdash;, of wanton Fame, who married five
Husbands in le&s;s than four Years; and impu|dently
declares, &s;he re&s;olves never to &s;tay above
a Fortnight unmarry'd at a time. But the&s;e
Examples are too mean for our mention; the
telling a &s;candalous Story of a &s;candalous Per|&s;on
is no Novelty, there's no In&s;truction in it,
nothing el&s;e is to be expected. But the prac|tice
of &s;uch things where Men pretend to un|der&s;tand
them&s;elves, to have a Sen&s;e of Repu|tation,
of Virtue, Prudence, and, above all, of
Religion; this indeed has &s;omething wonder|ful
in it, and is worth recording.</P>
<P>ANOTHER &s;candalous Piece of Matrimonial
Whoredom, and which I call untimely Marri|ages,
is that of marrying Infants and Per&s;ons
not of Ages fit for Marriage, or, as we &s;ay, not
marriageable. This has &s;omething extreamly
&s;hocking and &s;urfeiting in it, and, indeed, will
le&s;s bear a repetition, than any thing we have
&s;poken of yet; and I am harder put to it to
expre&s;s the ju&s;t Dete&s;tation of it, e&s;pecially in
the Ca&s;es which repre&s;ent them&s;elves on the
Particular before me, becau&s;e the Particulars,
and the Motives of them, can hardly be mo|de&s;tly
mentioned.</P>
<P><HI>J&mdash;M</HI>&mdash;, liv'd not twenty Miles off of
<HI>Highgate,</HI> he had two young Ladies in his
Hou&s;e, and who were bred up by him, or under
him, his own Daughter, and a little Cou&s;in his
Child's Play-fellow; his Wife died, that was the
fir&s;t opening to his Wickedne&s;s; they were
both young, his Daughter about eleven Years
old, the Cou&s;in between eleven and twelve,
from his little Cou&s;ins, being his Daughter's
Play-fellow, he wants to make her his own,
<PB N="353" REF="369">
and, in about two Years, made him&s;elf &s;o fami|liar
with her, (to de&s;cribe it no nearer) that he
dive&s;ted her of all Mode&s;ty al&s;o; but that he
might not make it a Piece of Debauchery, as
he called it, he gets a profligate Par&s;on, and
marries the Girl, him&s;elf upwards of Forty,
and the Child a little above Thirteen, which he
alledged was a marriageable Age, and before
&s;he was Fourteen &s;he was with Child by him.
Whether &s;he died in Child-bed or no, I do not
remember; but this I have heard for Truth,
that a few Years after he was under Pro&s;ecu|tion,
or at la&s;t fled the Country for a more
criminal Conver&s;ation with the t'other Child,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) his own Daughter, when, to palliate the
Matter, he would have marry'd her too; but
the De&s;ign was happily prevented. I hope no
Body would deny, but that whatever the fir&s;t
was, the la&s;t was not Matrimonial Whoredom
only, but Matrimonial Ince&s;t.</P>
<P>IT is true, the la&s;t is a &s;uperlative in Wick|edne&s;s,
and is needful to our Ca&s;e; but the
fir&s;t I take to merit very ju&s;tly the Title of
Matrimonial Whoredom, and to come within
the reach of my Text.</P>
<P>I could give a Counter-example to this in a
Woman upwards of Forty, who, having bred
up a Youth almo&s;t in Charity in her Family,
and being her &s;elf left a Widow, married the
little Boy, &s;o I call him, and did it with Cir|cum&s;tances
&s;candalous enough: The Particulars
indeed I have not at large, but at his Thir|teenth
Year &s;he married him, and before he was
Fifteen Years old, had a Child by him, and
after that three more.</P>
<P>I cannot enter into the Detail of her Story,
no not &s;o much as I have had an Account of,
<PB N="354" REF="370">
'tis too foul; I have indeed no Words for it;
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Language is not able to cover &s;uch
dirty Work, &s;o I mu&s;t leave it, as I am forced
to do &s;everal others; but you may depend up|on
it, if there is &s;uch a thing in Nature as that
I call Matrimonial Whoredom; it was here in
its highe&s;t Extent, and in the extreme of Inde|cency
and Immode&s;ty.</P>
<P>IT is true, the&s;e ought to have belonged to
the Chapter of <HI>Marriages in un&s;uitable Years;</HI>
but I rather place them here, becau&s;e I treat
the&s;e particular Articles as really criminal in
them&s;elves, and in the Nature of them; the
other might be unhappy, occa&s;ioned by the
un&s;uitable Circum&s;tances; but the&s;e were, as I
&s;ay, criminal; as <HI>Job</HI> &s;ays, they ought to have
been puni&s;hed by the Judge, they &s;tink in the
No&s;trils of all mode&s;t People, and are hateful
and odious in the Sight both of GOD and Man.</P>
<P>TO bring it to the Ca&s;e in hand: Here was
the E&s;&s;ence of Matrimonial Whoredom; the
meer incentive to this Marriage mu&s;t be the
wicked Part, the &s;atisfying the Brutal &s;en&s;ual
Appetite. What can it be le&s;s? The Office of
Matrimony was made but the Introduction, I
had almo&s;t &s;aid the U&s;her, to the Whoredom;
only that indeed the Matrimony is a pa&s;&s;ive
Circum&s;tance, not a voluntary Act; in a word,
Matrimony is abu&s;ed, and brought into it un|ju&s;tly;
and therefore, I think, they are right
in foreign Countries, where, in &s;uch Ca&s;es, the
Per&s;ons are liable to Puni&s;hment, not for the
vitious Part only, which it is hard to come at
there, as well as here; but they are liable, I &s;ay,
to Puni&s;hment, for abu&s;ing the holy Sacrament,
&s;o they call Matrimony, and making it to be a
Tool to hand them on to commit the Crime;
<PB N="355" REF="371">
this they call In&s;ulting the Church, and, in|deed,
&s;o I think it is; and they have their
Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Con&s;titutions, by which it is pu|ni&s;hable,
and the Prie&s;t is puni&s;hed al&s;o that of|ficiates
in &s;uch a Marriage.</P>
<P>BUT to quit this nau&s;eous Part as &s;oon as
we can; untimely Marriages are certainly
&s;candalous in their Nature, e&s;pecially where
the Age is unequal, where one, being young,
and &s;carce Ripe, by the ordinary Cour&s;e of
Nature, for the Marriage Bed, the other is of
full Age; 'tis not a Matrimonial Whoredom
only; 'tis, in my Opinion, a kind of a Matri|monial
Rape, becau&s;e it has &s;omething of Vio|lence
offered to Nature in it on one Side, and
&s;omething odiou&s;ly and criminally Immode&s;t,
on the other.</P>
<P>IT is true, and 'tis objected again&s;t me here,
that in other Countries it is ordinary for the
Children, e&s;pecially of great Families, to come
together young, and they have a u&s;ual Saying,
that like Fruit gathered green, and laid up,
they will ripen together; upon this Foot
they frequently marry very early, the Ladies at
eleven to twelve, and the Gentlemen at thir|teen
or fourteen; and, as it is the practice of
the Country, there's no Scandal in it.</P>
<P>I have little to &s;ay to this Practice abroad; I
know it is &s;o in <HI>Spain, Portugal,</HI> and &s;ome
other Places in the World; and there may be
natural Rea&s;ons to be given in ju&s;tification of
the Practice; &s;ome taken from the Con&s;titution
of the People, &s;ome from the Climate, &s;ome
from one Cau&s;e, &s;ome from another. Natura|li&s;ts
can &s;ay more to it than is needful here.
Man and Woman have a Vegetative, as well as
a &s;en&s;itive and rational Life; and there may
<PB N="356" REF="372">
be a phy&s;ical Rea&s;on given why Nature may
be riper in one Part of the World than in
another, and in &s;ome People &s;ooner than in
others; as it is evident the Sea&s;on for the pro|duction
of the &s;ame Fruits differ in one Place;
and in one Country from another, the Vintage
and the Corn-harve&s;t, differ in one Country
from another; here they gather in <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI>
there in <HI>October;</HI> and it may be the like in
other Things, and in Men and Women, as well
as in other Creatures, for, <HI>as I &s;aid,</HI> the vege|tative
Life obeys the Law of Nature in them,
as well as in Plants and Trees.</P>
<P>BUT 'tis enough that this is not the Cu&s;tom
in our Country, neither, perhaps, has Nature
prepared Things to have it be &s;o; and though
&s;ometimes we may see Exceptions here too, and
Contracts may be made &s;ooner, yet at &s;oonc&s;t
the Lady &s;hould be fourteen to fifteen, and the
Gentleman &s;ixteen to &s;eventeen, and even this
would be thought very &s;oon too.</P>
<P>I know, as above, it may be otherwi&s;e &s;ome|times;
but it is not looked upon as Mode&s;t or
Decent. I hear of an In&s;tance at this time of a
young Lady that is big with Child, at a little
above thirteen. But 'tis ill thought on; 'tis
made a Je&s;t of; 'tis call'd a Child with Child;
the Mother of the Girl is look'd awry upon,
and &s;poken ill of, for &s;uffering it; the young
Thing, is looked at as People look at a Sight or
Show, and as &s;omething mon&s;trous.</P>
<P>BUT what is this to the Ca&s;e in hand, where
the Couple is equal, the Matter is the le&s;s; and
if there be a Fault any where, it &s;eems to lie
upon the Parents, or the Guardians, or whoever
had the Conduct of the young People. But
this does not relate to the Ca&s;e that I am up|on;
<PB N="357" REF="373">
the two wretched Examples I have given,
and which were both within the narrow Com|pa&s;s
of my own Knowledge, are not at all ju&s;ti|fied
by the practice of other Nations; we are,
as Chri&s;tians, to be bound by the Laws of Do|cency
and Mode&s;ty, and, as Subjects of a ju&s;t
Government, by the Laws practis'd and receiv'd
in our own Country. It is the Cu&s;tom in &s;ome
Nations to go naked, and in others they cloath
&s;o light, that it is, as we &s;ay, next Door to go|ing
naked; their Cloaths being &s;o thin and light,
that all the Parts of the Body are, as it were,
de&s;cribed to the Eye, by the Garments &s;etting
&s;o clo&s;e to them; as in <HI>Italy,</HI> in <HI>Turkey</HI> and <HI>Bar|bary,</HI>
and other hot Countries: But &s;uch a Prac|tice,
though 'tis thought nothing of there,
would be thought immode&s;t here to the la&s;t
Degree, and indeed &s;candalous; and Chri&s;tians
are to cleave &s;o far to the Cu&s;tom of the
Place, as to do all Things that are of good
Report.</P>
<P>BUT I return to the Ca&s;e of untimely Mar|riages,
and I &s;hall clo&s;se it with a Story which I
have very good Authority for the Truth of,
where, though I cannot &s;ay there was any
thing of Immode&s;ty in the De&s;ign or Intention,
nor any thing Immode&s;t practis'd, or intended
to be practis'd, yet Heaven &s;eem'd to make it
an Unhappine&s;s to the Party, at lea&s;t it was a
&s;urprizing Di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>A certain antient Widow, having a tolerable
good E&s;tate, but no Children, and being up|wards
of &s;ixty Years of Age, had fixed her
Thoughts upon two young Women, which were
her Relations (Nieces I think) to leave what E|&s;tate
&s;he had to and which, divided between the
two, would have made them tolerable good For|tunes.</P>
<P><PB N="358" REF="374">
AS &s;he intended them this good Luck, &s;o 'tis
likely &s;he gave them &s;ome tolerable Additions
while &s;he was alive, as to their Education, and
perhaps to their Equipage.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, the fooli&s;h young Girls, &s;uppo|&s;ing
their Aunt had no Body el&s;e to give her
E&s;tate to, and not perhaps &s;en&s;ible of the Kind|ne&s;s
&s;hew'd them, at lea&s;t not &s;o &s;en&s;ible of it
as they ought to have been, carry'd it but
very indifferently to the old Lady; not only
&s;lighting her, and neglecting her on many Oc|ca&s;ion,
but &s;ometimes took upon them to be
&s;aucy to her; and, in a word, at length they
too plainly di&s;covered that they looked upon
the E&s;tate to be, as it were, their right, and
as if the old Lady lived too long for them;
they would be frequently talking to one ano|ther,
or to others, what they would do, and
how they would live when they came to the
E&s;tate, if the old Woman was but out of the
Way.</P>
<P>EITHER &s;ome officious People, perhaps Ser|vants,
had &s;pite enough to report this to the
old Lady, or the Nieces had the Indi&s;cretion to
let her hear &s;ome of it; the latter not very
unlikely; or &s;he gathered from the whole Te|nour
of their Conduct, that they &s;lighted her;
that they only waited the good Hour, that
what little Re&s;pect they &s;hew'd her, was evi|dently
for what they were to get by her,
and no otherwi&s;e, and that they waited with
impatience when &s;he would be plea&s;ed to walk
off: all which was indeed true in Fact.</P>
<P>AFTER the old Lady had thus taken
notice of their Conduct &s;ome time, &s;he once
took Occa&s;ion more particularly to let them
know it: She told them what &s;he had ob&s;erved,
<PB N="359" REF="375">
how unkindly they treated her, how perfectly
at liberty &s;he was to give her E&s;tate to whom
&s;he plea&s;ed, and that &s;he was not &s;o old, and
come to doat &s;o much, as to give what &s;he had
to tho&s;e that did not think it worth their while
to de&s;erve it, or that could not afford to be Civil
to her; that &s;he found they only gap'd for her
Death, and that &s;he &s;hould take care, if they
did not alter their Conduct, they &s;hould have
little enough to expect from her.</P>
<P>THIS alarm'd them a little; and if they had
been any thing but thoughtle&s;s Girls, they
would have chang'd their Methods a little. But
it wore off in a little time, and they went on
ju&s;t as they did before.</P>
<P>AT length the old Lady, thoroughly provok|ed
by their ill U&s;age, and her Re&s;entment be|ing
quickened by &s;ome particular extraordinary
Carriage, takes a &s;udden Re&s;olution to change
her way of living, leave off Hou&s;e-keeping,
and retire into the Country, to end her Days, as
&s;he called it, in Peace, and do good with what
&s;he had.</P>
<P>HER Nieces &s;oon found they had lo&s;t them|&s;elves
&s;o much with her, that they had
not Intere&s;t enough to alter her Re&s;olutions,
though they hung about her then with Tears
and Entreaties, &s;o they employ'd other Rela|tions
to intercede with her. But &s;he &s;oon
&s;topt their Mouths, with letting them know
how her Nieces had treated her, and what fair
Warning &s;he had given them, adding &s;ome par|ticular
Unkindne&s;&s;es which &s;he had met with
from them, and &s;ome Speeches which they had
been weak enough to let her overhear; upon
which to give away her E&s;tate to charitable U&s;es, or
<PB N="360" REF="376">
otherwi&s;e to di&s;po&s;e of it, &s;o that they &s;hould
never be at all better for it; and that it
was too late now to per&s;uade her, for &s;he was
fixed in her Mea&s;ures; and the Rea&s;ons being
&s;uch as could not be an&s;wered, her Neices had
nothing to do but to con&s;ider of &s;ome other
Ways to maintain them&s;elves, for &s;he had no
more to &s;ay to them.</P>
<P>THIS was di&s;mal News to the two Girls;
but they had no Remedy, &s;o they &s;hifted as
they could; we have no more to &s;ay about
them.</P>
<P>THE old Lady, according to her Re&s;olution,
as above, put off her Hou&s;e, and went into the
Country where her E&s;tate lay, and dwelt with
one of her Tenants in the Country; here &s;he
liv'd perfectly retir'd, and attended only with
one Servant; and by this Time &s;he was about
&s;ixty-five Years old, but of a &s;ound, hail Con|&s;titution,
a chearful, ea&s;y Di&s;po&s;ition, calm
Temper, and all the happy Tokens of long Life.</P>
<P>IT happened one Day, talking &s;eriou&s;ly with
her tenant, a good hone&s;t plain Man, but a
Man of Sen&s;e, and particularly of abundance
of religious Knowledge, &s;he made her Com|plaint
to him, how unkindly &s;he had been
treated by her Nieces, and how &s;he had re&s;ented
it, and was re&s;olved, as above, that none of
them &s;hould be the better for her.</P>
<P>THE good Man exhorted and per&s;uaded her
to forgive the young Women, to con&s;ider they
were young and gay, and wanted Di&s;cretion,
and that, no doubt, they would carry it other|wi&s;e
to her now, if &s;he would receive them a|gain;
he added the Command of our Saviour,
<HI>to forgive Enemies, and our offending Brother;</HI>
and &s;o pleaded often with her for the two poor
<PB N="361" REF="377">
Ca&s;t-off Girls. But he found the old Lady in|flexible;
&s;he had taken Things &s;o ill that &s;he
could not go back; &s;he would forgive them, &s;he
&s;aid, and pray for them, but &s;he would never
give her E&s;tate to them; that &s;he &s;aid &s;he was
not bound to do upon any Account whatever.
In a word, the good Man found there was no
room to &s;ay any thing farther upon that Sub|ject,
unle&s;s he would utterly di&s;oblige her,
which it was not his Bu&s;ine&s;s to do; &s;o he
meddled no more with it.</P>
<P>AFTER &s;ome time, the old Lady tells her
Tenant, &s;he wanted to &s;peak with him, and his
Wife and Daughter together; the Daughther
was, it &s;eems, a young married Woman, but a
&s;ober, grave and religious Body, like her Fa|ther;
and al&s;o of a Judgment above her Years;
and this, it &s;eems, made the old Lady take her
into the Council; the Tenant had al&s;o a Son,
but he was but a little Boy of about nine or
ten Years old.</P>
<P>AT this Meeting the old Lady tells them,
that as &s;he was now in Years, and could not
expect to live much longer, &s;he thought
it was time to &s;ettle her Affairs in the World,
and to di&s;po&s;e of what E&s;tate &s;he had to leave
behind her; that they all know how &s;he had
been treated by tho&s;e to whom &s;he had been
&s;o kind, and to whom &s;he had purpo&s;ed to be
&s;till &s;o much kinder; That they likewi&s;e knew
what her Re&s;olutions were with re&s;pect to
that; that at his Importunity however, &s;he
had &s;o far forgiven them, as to re&s;olve to give
each of them a Legacy of One hundred Pounds
to help to &s;upport them, and to te&s;tify her
Charity, notwith&s;tanding the ill U&s;age they
<PB N="362" REF="378">
had been plea&s;ed to give her; but that now
it was time for her to &s;ettle the re&s;t.</P>
<P>AFTER this Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;he told them, that
&s;he had been &s;tudying all po&s;lible Ways how
&s;he might di&s;po&s;e of the E&s;tate mo&s;t to her
&s;atisfaction; and that, upon the whole, &s;he
was re&s;olved to marry. The Tenant, a grave,
and, as I &s;aid, good Man, &s;eem'd to be greatly
di&s;ta&s;ted at that kind of Propo&s;al for &s;ettling
her E&s;tate, and the Tenant's Wife and Daugh|ter,
both began to di&s;cover their &s;urprize at it,
and a kind of nau&s;eating the Propo&s;al.</P>
<P>BUT hold, &s;ays &s;he, hear what I have far|ther
to &s;ay before you give your Opinion. My
Propo&s;al of marrying &s;hall have no Scandal in
it, I'll promi&s;e you; I &s;hall leave no room for
Reproach; and you will &s;ay &s;o, when you hear
who I have pitch'd upon for my Husband. In
&s;hort, there is a little Boy in your Town whom
I have cho&s;en for a Husband, and upon whom
I will &s;ettle my E&s;tate; and he is &s;o young,
that no Body can rai&s;e any Objection again&s;t
it; for, to be &s;ure, I &s;hall be in my Grave be|fore
he will be grown up to Man's E&s;tate; and,
giving them no time to an&s;wer, &s;he added, this
little Boy is your Son. I think, &s;ays &s;he, you
&s;ay he is not above nine or ten Years old, and
I am almo&s;t &s;eventy; and, if you give your
Con&s;ent, I'll put him to School; and after that,
if I &s;hould live &s;o long, I'll put him to 'Prentice
at <HI>London</HI> to a good Trade, and give One hun|dred
Pounds with him, and, to be &s;ure, I &s;hall
be dead before he will be out of his Time; and
then, &s;elling Part of the E&s;tate, he will have a
good Stock to &s;et up with, and the remainder
will make a good Jointure for a Wife.</P>
<P><PB N="363" REF="379">
THE Tenant was &s;trangely &s;urprized with
the Propo&s;al, and indeed was embara&s;s'd with it.
As for the Women, they were quite &s;ilenc'd.
But the good Man told her, that indeed the
Propo&s;al &s;he had made of marrying a Child,
would take away all the Scandal which he was
before concerned about on her Account; but
that it would be a &s;ad Blow to her own Rela|tions;
and tho' he knew not what to &s;ay as to
his Child, whom he would be very tender of
hurting, &s;eeing &s;he had &s;uch kind Thoughts a|bout
him, as to De&s;ign him her E&s;tate, yet he
could not &s;till but beg of her to con&s;ider very
well before &s;he Di&s;inherited her two Nieces,
and, at lea&s;t, to do &s;omething more for them.
But, in &s;hort, &s;he was immoveable as to that
Part; and, after &s;ome other Difficulties which
the old Tenant &s;tarted, for he did not &s;eem to
come very willingly into it, no not to the la&s;t,
it was however agreed on, and &s;he was married
to the Boy.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to her Propo&s;al, &s;he put him
to School, and had him made a very good
Scholar; and &s;he liv'd not only to &s;ee him
come home from the School, but to be big e|nough
to go 'Prentice, and al&s;o to &s;ee him come
out of his Time; by which time he was about
twenty-two Years of Age.</P>
<P>BUT, as I &s;aid, even this un&s;uitable Match
did not prove &s;o &s;atisfactory as might have been
expected; for it plea&s;ed GOD this Woman liv'd
to &s;uch a prodigious Age, that the little Boy
was &s;eventy-two Years of Age when he follow'd
her to the Church to bury her, and &s;he was One
hundred twenty-&s;even Years old.</P>
<P>THIS Story I had atte&s;ted to me by a Per&s;on
of an unque&s;tion'd Veracity, who told me, he
<PB N="364" REF="380">
was him&s;elf at her Funeral: She was &s;ixty-five
when &s;he marry'd him, and liv'd &s;ixty-two
Years with him; &s;he indeed made him &s;ome
Amends for the di&s;parity of Years by this,
that &s;he was a mo&s;t excellent Per&s;on, of an ini|mitable
Di&s;po&s;ition, pre&s;erv'd the Youth of her
Temper, and the Strength of her Under&s;tand|ing,
Memory and Eye-&s;ight to the la&s;t; and,
which was particularly remarkable, &s;he bred a
whole new Set of Teeth, as white as Ivory, and
as even as a Youth, after &s;he was ninety Years
old.</P>
<P>HERE was a Di&s;parity, 'tis true; but here
was none of the corrupt Part, which I have
made the Mark of my Reproof, and &s;o ju&s;tly
too. Here was no Vice, no &s;en&s;ual Part, to be
&s;o much as thought of; and yet, I &s;ay, it could
not but be a di&s;appointment to the young Man;
and &s;he would often complain to him of the
Injury &s;he did him in living &s;o long. But I
did not hear that it gave him any Unea&s;ine&s;s;
her extraodinary good Temper making him
&s;o much amends for it.</P>
<P>THERE is a Cu&s;tom of marrying Children
one to another by the Compact of their Parents,
while the &s;aid Children are very young; as has
been the Practice abroad, and as we had lately
an Example of in the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Courts,
tho' not very encouraging neither by its Suc|ce&s;s,
or fitted much for an Example.</P>
<P>THIS has its Inconveniencies in it on many
Accounts; but as they do not come within the
reach of the criminal Part, I do not &s;ay they
are concerned in the Reproof of this Satyr;
nor am I &s;peaking of &s;uch.</P>
<P>BUT &s;ince I am taking notice of the various
Sorts of untimely Marriages, and I have men|tioned
<PB N="365" REF="381">
this; I &s;hould do Ju&s;tice to the Practice
of our own Country in tho&s;e Ca&s;es, namely,
that in &s;uch Compacts of Parents they are ge|nerally
made thus, upon Condition that the
young People like one another when they are
grown up, and fit to come together.</P>
<P>THIS has both Rea&s;on and Religion in it,
and &s;eems to be founded upon the great Prin|ciple
of Liberty, both Civil and Eccle&s;ia&s;tick,
which this Nation are happy in the Enjoyment
of.</P>
<P>INDEED, it &s;eems a kind of Tyranny over
our Children, which we have no Power to ex|erci&s;e,
to anticipate their Affections, and oblige
them in their Infancy to take up with an Ob|ject
they have no liking to, and bind them
down here or there before-hand. I will not &s;ay,
but it may indeed be a kind of be&s;peaking their
Di&s;like from the natural Aver&s;ion which Men
commonly have to every Thing which is im|po&s;ed
upon them, and to that irk&s;ome Thing
call'd, <HI>Being Impo&s;ed upon.</HI></P>

and, as it were, Kidnap young Women away
into the Hands of Brutes and Sharpers, were
very &s;candalous, and it became almo&s;t dange|rous
for any one to leave a Fortune to the di&s;|po&s;al
of the Per&s;on that was to enjoy it, and
where it was &s;o left, the young Lady went al|ways
in Danger of her Life, &s;he was watch'd,
laid in wait for, and, as it were, be&s;ieged by
a continual Gang of Rogues, Cheats, Game|&s;ters,
and &s;uch like &s;tarving Crew, &s;o that &s;he
was obliged to confine her &s;elf like a Pri&s;oner
to her Chamber, be lock'd, and barr'd, and
bolted in, and have her Eyes every Moment
upon the Door, as if &s;he was afraid of Bayliffs
and Officers to arre&s;t her; or el&s;e &s;he was
&s;natch'd up, &s;eized upon, hurry'd up into a
<PB N="367" REF="383">
Coach and fix, a Fellow dre&s;s'd up in a Clergy|man's
Habit to perform the Ceremony, and a
Pi&s;tol clapt to her Brea&s;t to make her con&s;ent
to be marry'd: And thus the Work was done.
She was then carry'd to the private Lodging,
put to Bed under the &s;ame awe of Swords and
Pi&s;tols; a Fellow that &s;he never &s;aw in her Life,
and knows nothing of, comes to Bed to her,
deflowers her, or, as may be well &s;aid, ravi&s;hes
her, and the next Day &s;he is called a Wife, and
the Fortune &s;eized upon in the Name of the
Husband; and perhaps, in a few Days more,
play'd all away at the Box and the Dice, and
the Lady &s;ent home again naked, and a Beg|gar.</P>
<P>THIS was the Ca&s;e within the Times of our
Memory, till the Parliament thought fit to
make it Felony, and that without Bene&s;it of
Clergy, and till &s;ome of the&s;e Fortune Ravi&s;h|ers
have &s;ince that paid for their Succe&s;s at the
Gallows. And now, indeed, the Ladies are a
little &s;afer, and mu&s;t be attempted with a little
more Art, not taken by Storm, Sword in hand,
as Men take fortified Towns; but they mu&s;t
be brought to give a formal A&s;&s;ent by the cun|ning
of Female Agents, wheedling and delu|ding
them, and playing the Game another Way,
till they are decov'd into Wedlock; the Man
pretending him&s;elf Quality, and a Per&s;on equal
in E&s;tate; by which Craft a certain <HI>Kenti&s;h</HI>
Lady of Fortune, was mo&s;t exqui&s;itely drawn
in at once to marry a City Chimney-&s;weeper;
and was forc'd to &s;tand by it too, after &s;he came
to an under&s;tanding of the Bargain &s;he had
made; and another We&s;t Country Lady, a
Highwayman, and the like.</P>

THESE Matches, however, come within the
reach of our Complaint, and are but with too
much Ju&s;tice branded with the Charge of Ma|trimonial
Whoredom. It is true, in the&s;e Ca&s;es
it is the Money more then the Sen&s;uality, the
Fortune more than the Woman; and &s;o it
might be called Matrimonial Avarice. But as
the knowing of the Woman is the e&s;&s;ential fi|ni&s;hing
Part of the Work, and the Title or
Claim to the E&s;tate is fix'd upon a full Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion,
which they call a Con&s;ummation of the
Marriage; the Word Whoredom is not foreign
to the Charge, at lea&s;t on the Man's Side, be|cau&s;e
he lies with the Woman, not as a wedded
Wife, according to GOD'S holy Ordinance, but
meerly to entitle him to her E&s;tate, which, in
&s;hort, is perfecting the End of Matrimony,
and no Man can &s;ay, it is a legal Marriage in
the Sight of Him who&s;e appointment only can
make Matrimony lawful.</P>
<P>MARRYING Women by force, can never be
called marrying according to GOD'S holy Or|dinance;
for all Violence is unju&s;t, and all
$nju&s;tice is incon&s;i&s;tent with Holine&s;s. For
an impure and righteous De&s;ign can never be
comprehended in a holy and pure In&s;titution;
it is determined by almo&s;t all the Laws of Ma|trimony
in the World, that Marriage ought to
be the Act and Deed of both the Parties, the
Act and Deed not of their meer Compliance,
and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion by Nece$lity, but the Act of
their Minds, their free and uncon&s;trained
Choice; and if it be not &s;o, it is not really a
lawful Marriage. Marriage by con&s;traint is
like a Bond given in Pri&s;on, the Party is not
bound to the Payment: To be marry'd by force
is not to be Married, but to be taken Captive
<PB N="369" REF="385">
and ravi&s;hed, as the <HI>Turks</HI> take Slaves, and
then chu$ing them for their Beauty, &s;ingle
them out for the Seraglio, to be lain with by
the Emperor, or by the Ba&s;ha or Grand Vizier,
who&s;e Serail they are enclo&s;ed in, whenever
he plea&s;es to demand them.</P>
<P>IN a word, a forc'd Marriage is a Contra|diction
in Speech, the Terms are incon&s;i&s;tent;
'tis no Marriage at all, or, if you will call it a
Marriage, 'tis no Matrimony. How are the
Women &s;o us'd, &s;aid to take &s;uch a Man to be
their wedded Husband? The very meaning of
the Word Matrimony, in &s;everal Languages,
&s;ignifies chu&s;ing: Can a Woman be &s;aid to
chu&s;e the Man, when &s;he is dragg'd to his Bed
as a Malefactor is dragg'd to Execution, or, as
we expre&s;s it, as a Bear to the Stake? <HI>that is
to &s;ay,</HI> to the Place where he is to be Baited
with Dogs, and which he knows is to be his
Ca&s;e, and therefore hangs back till he is haul'd
along by the Ring in his No&s;e, and cannot re|&s;i&s;t
it.</P>
<P>BRING this back to our former Te&s;t: Every
Marriage where the pure and &s;imple End of
the Matrimony is not &s;uch as agrees with the
religious End of the In&s;titution, is, in Sen&s;e,
a Matrimonial Whoredom, and no other, and,
among all the re&s;t, this of forcing a Woman to
be marry'd, is one of the wor&s;t.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t be allow'd here to except Political
State Marriages, made for the Intere&s;t of Na|tions,
forming Alliances and Friend&s;hips, bind|ing
or engaging Con&s;ederacies and Leagues,
between Princes and People.</P>
<P>ALSO Family-Marriages for the pre&s;erving
E&s;tates in the Lines and Blood of Hou&s;es, keep|ing
up the Names and Relations, and the like
<PB N="370" REF="386">
prudent Ends; in which Ca&s;e, though Vio|lence
is not u&s;ed, yet 'tis generally expected
the Women &s;hould comply, and they do com|ply,
I may &s;ay they do always comply indeed.
I &s;carce remember an In&s;tance in Hi&s;tory of
any that have refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>IF there is any thing in the&s;e Matches to
the di&s;like of the Parties, they mu&s;t take it as
an Accident to the Dignity of their Birth, and
go through it as well as they can; they have
generally the State and Honour of their Birth
and Families, and the Titles they po&s;&s;e&s;s, to
make up the Deficiencies, and to be Equiva|lents
for the lo&s;s of their per&s;onal Endearments;
&s;o we have nothing to &s;ay to tho&s;e Things.
If Princes and great Per&s;ons are content to
marry on tho&s;e Conditions, they mu&s;t do as
they plea&s;e, the Con&s;equence is to them&s;elves.
We are not &s;peaking here of People under the
Influence of Politick Government, and who
move this Way or that, by Rea&s;ons of State;
but of People within the Circle of Equality
with our &s;elves, and under the Government
of Laws both of Ju&s;tice and Rea&s;on, and al&s;o of
the Con&s;titution; and to &s;uch, I think, what
I have ob&s;erved, is ju&s;t. Matrimony is a Law
of Decency, binding to Chri&s;tians, and to Peo|ple
who pretend to live and act as Chri&s;tians
do, or &s;hould do; and tho&s;e who do not proceed
in it with a due regard to Decency and Chri|&s;tianity
too, &s;hould lay a&s;ide the Name of Chri|&s;tian,
and pretend to it no more.</P>
<P>IT is true, there are various Sorts of forced
Marriages. Tho&s;e which I have named, <HI>viz.</HI> tak|ing
a Woman away by Strength, and terrifying
her afterward into Compliance, our Laws, as I
<PB N="371" REF="387">
have &s;aid, have declared again&s;t; &s;o that I need
&s;ay nothing more to them.</P>
<P>THERE is al&s;o a violence of Importunity,
and a violence of Authority; both the&s;e al&s;o
I have &s;poken to at length, as well as the Vio|lence
occa&s;ioned by the Per&s;on having it in
his or her Power to give or with-hold the For|tunes
and Portions of the Persons.</P>
<P>BUT there is yet a violence of Treachery;
and this is al&s;o a Crime which indeed ought to
be puni&s;hed by the Judge. This is generally
practis'd upon the Ladies indeed, but &s;ome|times
both Sides are engag'd, and it is done
with the utmo&s;t Cunning and Artifice: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> a
Spy, or &s;ecret Agent is plac'd in the Family, (or
as near it as may be) where the Per&s;on lives,
and who in&s;inuating into the Acquaintance of
the Lady, and perhaps into her Con&s;idence and
Favour, fails not to encroach gradually &s;o far,
as to bring the Per&s;on who de&s;ires her A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance,
or employs her for that Purpo&s;e, into the
Lady's Company; recommends him, gives his
Character, &s;ets other People to give his Cha|racter;
and thus, in a word, the Lady is SET, as
a Rook &s;ets a Cully, for a Sharper, that is to
&s;ay; for, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>PERHAPS my Readers may be too &s;ober to
under&s;tand the <HI>Newgate</HI> Language, that is &s;uit|able
to this wicked Work; namely, that the
Cully is an innocent or ignorant Per&s;on, who a
Sharper, that is a Game&s;ter, wants to draw
in to Play.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Rook</HI> is a third Per&s;on, who &s;ets him
as they call it, that is, gets into his Company,
in&s;inuates into his Society, &s;crapes Acquaint|ance
with him, and &s;o gets him to an Alehou&s;e
or Tavvern, where the Game&s;ter is &s;ure to lie
<PB N="372" REF="388">
ready, and &s;o draw the poor ignorant Man in
to play, and cheat him of his Money.</P>
<P>IN like manner the <HI>Sharper</HI> here employs
the <HI>Rook</HI> too, and who, in the&s;e Ca&s;es, is al|ways
a Woman. She is &s;ure to get acquainted
with the Lady; and, after &s;ome time, and get|ting
into her Confidence, takes care to let the
Lady know, that &s;he under&s;tands that a cer|tain
Gentleman, who lodges in &s;uch a Place, is
in Love with her; that &s;he came to under&s;tand
it by a very odd Accident; and then &s;he tells
her a formal Story, that being at &s;uch a Place a
vi&s;iting, and &s;ome Company coming in that
were Strangers, they all &s;at down to drink Tea;
that there was a young Gentleman, a pretty
mode&s;t kind of Gentleman among them, which
the Lady of the Hou&s;e call'd Cou&s;in, and that
accidentally ri&s;ing up to make Room for more
Company, the Gentleman, &s;ays the Spy, hap|pened
to be plac'd to &s;it next to me; upon
which, &s;ays &s;he, I pu&s;h'd my Chair back to &s;it
farther off.</P>
<P>BUT what do you mean, &s;ays the Lady,
(perhaps willing enough to hear of the Thing)
of being in Love with me, when he was a
Stranger to you?</P>
<P>LAW, <HI>my Dear,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, I never &s;aw the
Gentleman before in my Life. But&mdash;</P>
<P>BUT what&mdash;What makes you talk &s;uch
Stuff? &s;ays the Lady; &s;till nettled with what
&s;he had &s;aid &s;ubtilly and &s;lily before.</P>
<P>WELL, he's a clever hand&s;ome Gentleman,
that I mu&s;t needs &s;ay; and &s;o &s;he pa&s;&s;es it off,
and talks of &s;omething el&s;e to &s;ee how the Lady
would take it.</P>
<P>AS &s;he thought, &s;o it was; the Lady was
touch'd with the fir&s;t Piece of the Tale, and &s;till
<PB N="373" REF="389">
kept her original Speech in her Thoughts, that
the Gentleman was in Love with her; but be|ing
re&s;olved to put her to the Nece&s;&s;ity of ask|ing
her again, &s;he kept back a great while;
at la&s;t the Lady brought it about again, and
ask'd, Who this Gentleman was?</P>
<P>SHE an&s;wered nimbly, &s;he did not know
him; but, it &s;eems, he was one of her Ad|mirers.</P>
<P>WHAT do you mean by that? <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> I
don't know him.</P>
<P>'TIS no matter for that, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> he knows
you.</P>
<P>HOW do you know that? <HI>&s;ays the Lady,</HI> when
you &s;ay you don't know the Man.</P>
<P>O, Madam, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> I know it for all that.</P>
<P>AND thus &s;he led her on Artfully, till &s;he
found &s;he had rai&s;ed her Expectation a little;
and then &s;he told her Story thus:</P>
<P>WHY, Madam, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> as I told you, I
thru&s;t my Chair back to &s;it farther off, the Gen|tleman
being like to &s;it next me; but Madam
&mdash;, meaning the Lady at who&s;e Hou&s;e they
were, came, and thru&s;ting the Gentleman's
Chair next to mine; Come, Sir, &s;ays &s;he to
him, pray &s;it next to this Gentlewoman, &s;he
lodges in the &s;ame Hou&s;e where the Lady lives
that is your particular Favourite.</P>
<P>SAY you &s;o, <HI>&s;ays the Gentleman,</HI> with all my
Heart; I honour every Thing that is but
known to Madam&mdash;, meaning your &s;elf;
and &s;o he &s;at down.</P>
<P>WHO can that be? <HI>&s;ays the Lady.</HI></P>
<P>NAY, indeed, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> I don't know that;
but he is a very fine Gentleman, I a&s;&s;ure you;
&s;o fine a Carriage, &s;o mode&s;t, and talks &s;o
fine.</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="390">
THEN you talk'd with him, it &s;eems, <HI>&s;ays
the Lady.</HI></P>
<P>THE Company were very merry, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI>
and evey Body talk'd, But he has a World of
Wit, that's certain.</P>
<P>NAY, I know you are a good Judge, <HI>&s;ays the Lady.</HI></P>
<P>No, Madam, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> that don't follow; but
all the Company &s;aid &s;o, as well as I.</P>
<P>NOT to his Face, I hope.</P>
<P>NO, Madam; but he went away. My Lord
&mdash;fetch'd him away in his Coach and &s;ix.</P>
<P>THIS touch'd her again; and the cunning
Manager could perceive it plain enough. So
&s;he dropp'd the Di&s;cour&s;e again, and run on up|on
other Things; but upon &s;everal Turns the
Lady brought it about again: At la&s;t, &s;he was
&s;imple enough to ask her, If &s;he thought there
was any Thing in it? Which was all the Crea|ture
wanted.</P>
<P>SHE an&s;wered, yes, indeed, &s;he believed there
was, for &s;he could perceive the Gentleman was
mightily plea&s;ed when any Body did but &s;peak
of her.</P>
<P>BUT who, <HI>&s;ays the Lady,</HI> could pretend to
name me to him.</P>
<P>O, Madam, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> I doubt not he had given
Occa&s;ion enough for that before.</P>
<P>I hope you took no notice that you knew
me, <HI>&s;ays the Lady.</HI></P>
<P>NAY, Madam, how could I help that, <HI>&s;ays
&s;he,</HI> when they all told him I lodged in the
&s;ame Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>WHY, that's true indeed, <HI>&s;ays the Lady,</HI> I
didn't think of that.</P>
<P>WELL, Madam, you need not be concern'd,
<HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> I &s;aid nothing to your Di&s;advantage, I
a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
<P><PB N="375" REF="391">
THEN &s;he began to enquire into the Di&s;|cour&s;e;
and the &s;ubtil Creature took care to
tell her a thou&s;and fine Things of him, which
he never &s;aid; how he toa&s;ted her Health, and
what fine Things he &s;aid of her, when, perhaps,
not a Word was ever mentioned. But &s;he &s;aw
it work'd as &s;he would have it, till, in &s;hort,
&s;he brought her to be in Love with the Gentle|man
too, and that before &s;he had &s;een him.</P>
<P>TIME brought Things about; and the young
Lady was weak enough to go and vi&s;it the Lady
at the Hou&s;e where this Gentleman had been
&s;een, and which, it &s;eems, was but a few Doors
off; and the Spy had &s;o much Knowledge of it,
as to give the Gentleman notice, who found
Ways to get into the Company, and to make his
Acquaintance with her. And thus it began.</P>
<P>FROM this Beginning, the Manager carry'd
on all the re&s;t. The Gentleman was repre&s;ent|ed
as an Heir to a great E&s;tate, but not quite of
Age, and that if &s;he had him &s;he might depend
upon a thou&s;and a Year Jointure; and, in a
word, &s;he drew the unwary Lady into a pri|vate
Marriage, and &s;o to throw her&s;elf away
upon a young Fellow, without a Shilling in
his Pocket, and a good-for-nothing empty|headed
Fellow to boot. As good hap was, he
was not a Rake, and &s;o &s;he was le&s;s ruined
than &s;he would otherwi&s;e have been; but &s;till
&s;he was &s;o far undone, as to be able to make
no Provi&s;ion for her &s;elf but what he plea&s;ed to
do in good Nature, which was about One hun|dred
Pounds a Year; and was all &s;he could &s;ave
out of about Thirteen thou&s;and Pounds.</P>
<P>I could fill up this Account with &s;uch Matri|monial
Frauds as this, and &s;ome much more
tragical; but there is no Room for it: This
<PB N="376" REF="392">
may &s;uffice to &s;hew the Meaning of the thing;
'tis not &s;o remote from the De&s;ign as may be
&s;ugge&s;ted. Trapanning of Women is not much
better than Whoring. It is true, the Woman
is innocent, the Whoredom is on the Man's
Side only, but on his Side it is evidently &s;o,
and no otherwi&s;e; 'tis a Complication of Crime;
'tis a double Robbery, for they plunder the in|nocent
Lady of her Honour and of her E&s;tate,
both at once; not only her Money is &s;eiz'd
on, and immediately wa&s;ted, &s;quander'd, per|haps
gam'd away, or wor&s;e, but &s;he is oxpo&s;ed
to the utmo&s;t Contempt and Di&s;grace.</P>
<P>FIRST, expecting that &s;he is received into
the Arms of a Gentleman, and that &s;he takes
into her Embraces and to her Affection, a Man
of Honour and Fortune, &s;he is pro&s;tituted to a
Scoundrel, a Mechanick, or, which is infinite|ly
wor&s;e, a Rake, a debauch'd infected Carka&s;e,
who at once de&s;poils her of her &s;elf, &s;o we may
ju&s;tly call it, and communicates to her the
wor&s;t of all Contagion, a Poi&s;on in her Blood,
an impure and loath&s;ome Plague, &s;o that &s;he is
ruin'd at once in Life and E&s;tate.</P>
<P>THIS is wor&s;e than Matrimonial Whore|dom,
for it is Matrimonial Murther, and the
poor Lady is undone; &s;he is Beggar'd on one
hand, and ruin'd on the other, and is &s;oon tran&s;|pos'd
from a fine furni&s;hed Hou&s;e to an Ho&s;pital,
and from thence to the Grave, and perhaps&s;tarv'd
too, to make her Mi&s;eries more compleat.</P>
<P>THIS is a Mi&s;chief we yet want a Law for;
and, indeed, 'tis wonderful to me that we &s;hould
do &s;o. It &s;eems to me, that a Man in &s;uch Cir|cum&s;tances
merits as much the Gallows for an
attempt of that Nature, as it is po&s;&s;ible for him
to do by any other Crime he can commit. I
<PB N="377" REF="393">
would humbly recommend it to the Legi&s;lature
to think of proper Remedies for &s;o dreadful a
Mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>IT is not for me to dictate Mea&s;ures in &s;uch
Ca&s;es; 'tis enough that I repre&s;ent the Crime,
that I endeavour to dre&s;s it up in &s;uch Cloaths
as are proper to &s;et it forth in. All that is due
to a Robber, a Ravi&s;her, and a Murtherer,
&s;eems to be due to the Per&s;on that is thus guilty;
for he manife&s;tly commits all the&s;e Crimes,
and that in the mo&s;t inten&s;e Degree, 1. He is
a Robber, for he ve&s;ts him&s;elf with a legal
Claim to the Lady's E&s;tate, by a fraudulent,
&s;urreptitous and deceitful Attack, a Feint and
Di&s;gui&s;e, making him&s;elf appear to be what
he is not, and taking Po&s;&s;e&s;ion as a Robber;
being quite another Per&s;on than him he was
&s;uppo&s;ed to be.</P>
<P>2. HE is a Ravi&s;her of the wor&s;t Kind, becau&s;e
he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the Per&s;on and Honour of the Lady
by Fraud, and in a Circum&s;tance, which if &s;he
was acquainted with, &s;he would never &s;ubmit to,
but by the utmo&s;t Violence, and perhaps would
much rather chu&s;e to be murthered than to
be &s;o u&s;ed.</P>
<P>3. To conclude: He is a Murtherer, and that in
the mo&s;t horrid Method of Murther that can be
imagined. I need go no farther to de&s;cribe the
Ca&s;e, than is done in an Example given in this
very Work, <HI>Page</HI> 177. where the Tragedy was
lamentable indeed.</P>
<P>WHAT now can be e&s;teemed a Puni&s;hment
equal to this Crime? And why might it not be
called a righteous Law to puni&s;h with Death a
Man, that, deceiving a Woman in Marriage,
&s;hould bring to her a Body infected with the
foul Di&s;ea&s;e, and give it his Wife, it being
<PB N="378" REF="394">
known that he contracted the Di&s;temper before
Marriage.</P>
<P>NOR would it be &s;o hard to prove the Fact
as &s;ome may imagine; I mean, that it would
not be difficult to &s;tate in the Terms of &s;uch a
Law, certain and publik Clau&s;es, by which the
Fact &s;hould be both enquired into, and admit
a fair Proof; for &s;uch is the Nature of the Con|tagion,
that it is not ea&s;ily concealed, and the
Evidences may be made very clear; as parti|cularly
the Per&s;on's having been under Cure
before his Marriage; &s;uch a Man ought never
to dare to marry, except with the Whore who
infected him; and there indeed he ought to go,
that they may Rot together.</P>
<P>BUT for &s;uch a Man to apply to a Woman
of Virtue and Mode&s;ty; &s;ound in Body, and
and upright in her Intention, come to her
with a Contagion in his Vitals, and abu&s;e her
in &s;uch a vile, odious and abominable Kind!
As the Crime is not to be named without Abhor|rence
and Execration, &s;o the Criminal merits
to be turn'd out of humane Society, that he may
abu&s;e no more, and may be a Terror to others.</P>
<P>CERTAINLY this de&s;erves Death as much as
&s;everal Crimes, which are at this time puni&s;hed
with it, and particularly as much as Highway|Robbery,
for the Plunder is attended with infi|nitely
wor&s;e Circum&s;tances, and has many
wor&s;e Aggravations attending it.</P>
<P>I add no more. I cannot doubt but the fatal
Con&s;equences, and the frequency of this hor|rible
Crime, (and that in the&s;e Days, I believe,
more than ever) will at length awaken Ju&s;tice;
and we &s;hall, one time or other, have a &s;uitable
Law to puni&s;h it; and this, I believe, would
be the only Way to prevent it for the future.</P>

<HEAD>THE
CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>_I am now come to the Conclu&s;ion
of this Work: I had Thoughts to
have given a longer Preface to it,
intimating the true End and De&s;ign
of it: But I think 'tis better in
the Form of a Conclu&s;ion: For
when can a Work be better explain'd than after
it is done?</P>
<P>I can find but two Objections that can lie a|gain&s;t
this Undertaking, or the Performance of it;
after the &s;tricte&s;t Inquiry into every Part of it,
and, as Author, I think my &s;elf pretty clear in
them Both. Of which the impartial Reader is
to be the Judge.</P>
<P>1. WHETHER the Satyr be Ju&s;t.</P>
<P>2. WHETHER the Manner be Ju&s;tifiable.</P>
<P>IF indeed the Satyr is not ju&s;t, the Author
has done nothing, and can have nothing to &s;ay
why he &s;hould not lie under the wor&s;t of Cen|&s;ure;
but he is under no Care upon that Sub|ject:
Even the mo&s;t Innocent will hardly enter
upon the Point with me, or venture to &s;ay,
<PB N="380" REF="396">
that tho' they may be clear of it them&s;elves, that
therefore no Body is guilty; and as for the
re&s;t, tho' they are harden'd again&s;t Blu&s;hing at
it, I don't find any of them harden'd enough to
deny it.</P>
<P>WE are come to an Age, wherein 'tis not the
Mode to acknowledge and reform a Mi&s;take,
but to add a Front to the Fact, and Triumph in
the Crimes, which they &s;hould be a&s;hamed of:
It &s;eems below them to vindicate their Chara|cter,
they'll rather illu&s;trate it with the Fault
they &s;hould wipe off, and count the Shame of it
their Glory.</P>
<P>THIS happy Cu&s;tom is the Author's Vindi|cation
in this Work; for now &s;corning to deny
the Charge, or enter into an Enquiry in form,
whether <HI>guilty</HI> or not <HI>guilty;</HI> they are for giving
the Matter of Fact in Evidence, and in&s;i&s;ting
that there is no Crime in it. And thus we
join I&s;&s;ue upon the Merit of the Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>IF it be &s;o; if there is no &s;uch thing as Im|mode&s;ty
after Matrimony, and that nothing can
be indecent or unlawful between a Man and his
Wife; if Matrimonial Liberties are without
Bounds, and there are no Limitations to that
conjugal Freedom, neither by the Laws of GOD
or of Nature.</P>
<P>IF the Man cannot &s;in again&s;t his Wife, or
the Wife again&s;t her Husband; if no Exce&s;&s;es
can be complained of, and nothing can be ei|ther
out of Mea&s;ure, or out of Sea&s;on; if no
unnatural Violences can be offered, and the
Woman can have no rea&s;on to <HI>turn her Slipper
the wrong Side upward again&s;t her Husband.</HI></P>
<P>IF the Laws of Matrimony cannot be broken,
the Ends of Matrimony not defeated, the Rea|&s;on
of Matrimony not be mi&s;taken, and a
Marriage cannot be made a Ma&s;que to a Crime.</P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="397">
IN a word, if all the Complaints of this
kind are cau&s;ele&s;s and needle&s;s, and there are
neither the Crimes or the Criminals to be found,
or to be heard of among us, then indeed the
Satyr cannot be ju&s;t, and the Author de&s;erves
the Cen&s;ure of a fal&s;e Accu&s;er. Let him be
try'd by GOD, and his Country; and let the
abu&s;ed Per&s;ons who are without the Sin, throw
the fir&s;t Stone at him.</P>
<P>BUT if the Fact is to be prov'd, if the Guilt
is notorious, if he not only has pointed out the
Crime, but is ready, if called upon in a lawful
way, to point out the Criminals too, and to
convict them upon their own Evidence, and
out of their own Mouths; if they not only
daily commit tho&s;e Things, but daily boa&s;t of
them; if the Coffee-hou&s;es are witne&s;&s;es on one
Side, and the Tea-Tables blu&s;h on the other,
and lewd Dialogues on that wicked Subject cir|culate
from one to t'other; if the differing Sexes
are united in the guilt, tho' in a differing way,
and the odious Facts are become flagrant, 'tis
then high time to combate the Vice, and en|deavour
by any po&s;&s;ible Ways to bring the
World to blu&s;h for them, &s;ince they are pa&s;t
blu&s;hing for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>AS the Guilt thus legitimates the Satyr, &s;o
the Circum&s;tances of it, and the unhappy &s;tate
of Things ju&s;tifies the Author in the Method of
attacking it. The Law cannot reach it; the
Fact is not cogni&s;able in a way of Ju&s;tice; no
criminal Proce&s;s can lie in the Ca&s;e, 'tis one of
the Offences that are too vile to be hid, and yet
too &s;ecret, and too much hid, to be laid hold
of. They &s;eem to be fenced and protected by
tho&s;e very Laws that &s;hould cen&s;ure and ex|po&s;e
them; and tho' they frequently &s;ally out,
<PB N="362" REF="398">
and make criminal Excur&s;ions, yet when they
are attack'd, they retreat behind the Fences
and Fortifications of the conjugal Laws, and
the Letter of Matrimony is turn'd again&s;t the
Meaning of it, as the Cannon of a Ba&s;tion,
when the Work is taken, are turn'd again&s;t the
Town which they were mounted to defend.</P>
<P>SATYR can &s;courge where the La&s;h of the
Law cannot; the Teeth and Talons of the Pen
will bite and tear; and the Satyr has a Sting
which is made for the Correction of &s;uch Of|fences
and &s;uch Offenders as bully Ju&s;tice, and
think them&s;elves out of the reach of Pri&s;ons
and Puni&s;hments; as &s;mall Arms are of u&s;e in
Battle where the Cannon and Mortars cannot
play, and the Point of the Lance can wound
where the Balls cannot fly.</P>
<P>IF Men are fenc'd again&s;t one Thing, they
may not be fenc'd again&s;t another, and the
&s;en&s;e of Shame may re&s;train where even a
&s;en&s;e of Puni&s;hment will not. There are Crimes
which a la&s;h of the Pen reach'd when a la&s;h
at the Cart's-tail would not; and a time when
Men that have laugh'd at the Law, and ridi|culed
all its Powers, have yet been laugh'd
out of their Crimes by a ju&s;t Satyr, and brought
to the nece&s;&s;ity of hanging them&s;elves for
Shame, or reforming to prevent it.</P>
<P>IF then the Crime be evident, and yet the
Law impotent, who will contend that the
Satyr is not ju&s;t? 'Tis the only unexceptiona|ble
Ca&s;e in which not the Ju&s;tice only, but the
Nece&s;&s;ity of a Satyr, is to be in&s;i&s;ted on.</P>
<P>SOME will &s;ay, and in this particular Ca&s;e I
think they are right, that there is no &s;uch thing
as an unju&s;t Satyr; that a Satyr is never wrong,
nor can be &s;o; for that,</P>
<P><PB N="363" REF="399">
1. IF the Fact be not true, 'tis no more a
Satyr but a Slander; 'tis a LIE, and merits the
Correction of the Law.</P>
<P>2. IF the Fact be true, but is in it &s;elf no
Crime, the Satyr has no Teeth, no Claws, it
can neither Bite or Sting; and then again 'tis
no more a Satyr; it has only a kind of clo&s;e
par'd Nails with which it can &s;cratch its own
Face, and can hurt no Body el&s;e; &s;o that 'tis
no more a Satyr, nor will it bear to be call'd
by that Name. But this is out of the Way
here.</P>
<P>WE in&s;i&s;t upon the Ju&s;tice of the Satyr, as
well from the Nature of the Charge it brings,
as from the certainty of the Fact proved by
the Confe&s;&s;ion of the guilty Offenders, and the
general Te&s;timony of the Times, as above.</P>
<P>IT remains then to &s;peak of the Manner of
the Performance, and enter upon the Vindica|tion
of it, a thing much more properly under|taken,
now 'tis fini&s;h'd, than it cou'd be before
it was begun.</P>
<P>THE only Objections which can lie again&s;t
the manner, I think, come into the&s;e two. (1.)
The nece&s;&s;ity of &s;peaking a Language that is
unplea&s;ant to hear, and which, at lea&s;t, &s;eems
to tread on the brink of the &s;ame Indecency
which it reproves; AND which al&s;o the Author
has &s;ufficiently expre&s;s'd his dread of. OR, (2.)
The deficiency of the Reproof from an over|re&s;traint,
and declining to expre&s;s Things fully
on that very Account, for fear of offending one
Way, offending too much the other.</P>
<P>I have, with the utmo&s;t Care, avoided the
fir&s;t of the&s;e; I have &s;tudied to &s;hun all Inde|cency
of Expre&s;&s;ion, or &s;aying any thing that
<PB N="384" REF="400">
might offend the cha&s;te&s;t Mind, and the mo&s;t
mode&s;t Ear, allowing but ju&s;t room to mention
the Crime that is reproved, and hardly that in
&s;ome Places &s;ufficient to have it under&s;tood.</P>
<P>IF I have given the lea&s;t Cau&s;e of Complaint,
I profe&s;s it to be un&s;een and unde&s;igned; nor
upon revi&s;ing the whole Work, do I yet &s;ee
any Rea&s;on for altering or wiping out any
thing on that Account.</P>
<P>THE Scripture it &s;elf, the &s;acred Pattern of
Mode&s;ty in Expre&s;&s;ion, and which I have all
along kept in my Eye as a Director in that
particular Point, has, in many Places, been ob|liged
to &s;peak plainer than I have done in the
like Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>BUT when the Cen&s;ure is to be pa&s;s'd, there
mu&s;t be &s;o much &s;aid at lea&s;t; as may let the
Reader under&s;tand what it is we reprove, or
el&s;e we &s;peak of nothing, and to no purpo&s;e;
yet I have &s;tudied with the utmo&s;t Care to do
it, &s;o as to leave no room for Reproach. None
can find Occa&s;ion to blu&s;h here but tho&s;e that
are guilty; let them blu&s;h and reform, then the
End of the Satyr is an&s;wered.</P>
<P>AS to the &s;econd Ca&s;e; I cannot but lament
the nece&s;&s;ity I have been under to omit &s;everal
flagrant Stories, with Names and Sirnames too
attending them, good Evidence of Fact ready,
which yet I have not been able to find Words
to expre&s;s with Decency enough to bear read|ing,
or to pre&s;erve the Purity of the De&s;ign,
and the Dignity of a ju&s;t Satyr.</P>
<P>WHAT vile and perhaps unheard-of Practices
could I have expo&s;ed, could I have found Words
to dre&s;s up the Relation in? And what inimi|table
Examples have I ready to produce to &s;up|port
<PB N="385" REF="401">
the Truth of the Facts, would the Stories
but bear telling.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, 'tis &s;omething hard that Men &s;hou'd
&s;in on, only becau&s;e they cannot be mode&s;tly
reproved; that they &s;hou'd go on in &s;uperlative
Wickedne&s;s, with an Impunity only owing to
the horrid exorbitance of their Crime, too dirty
to be &s;poken of, too nau&s;eous to be mentioned.
Why has not our fruitful Inventions added
&s;ome Signals, &s;ome Figures, to &s;erve in&s;tead of
Speech, (as I have ob&s;erved the <HI>Turks</HI> do, by
turning up the Slipper) by which Signals or
Figures the filthy Part might be expre&s;&s;ed,
without fouling the Mouth, or affronting the
Ears of others.</P>
<P>BUT it is not to be done, and therefore, as
above, I have cho&s;en to leave out many long
Hi&s;tories of inexpre&s;&s;ible Lewdne&s;s, parti|cularly
under the Matrimonial Cover, and
which would have given a keener Edge to the
Satyr, and have confirmed the Nece&s;&s;ity of the
Reproof in this Ca&s;e, more than all that has
been expre&s;s'd. But, I &s;ay, it is not to be
done.</P>
<P>WHERE I have been nece&s;&s;itated to come to
the very Brink of the Fact, and to go as far as
Language would &s;uffer me; certainly I hope
for &s;o much Charity in the Reader, as to ac|knowledge
the Ju&s;tice and Nece&s;&s;ity of going
&s;o far, at the &s;ame time giving the true Rea&s;on
of my going no farther.</P>
<P>'TIS a hard&s;hip an Author is &s;eldom put to,
to be obliged to break off in the middle of his
Evidence; to omit and drop all the Illu&s;trations
of his Story, and &s;carce give you enough of the
Generals to gue&s;s at the Particulars by; but
this is my Ca&s;e, and all in obedience to that
<PB N="386" REF="402">
Mode&s;ty, the tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing upon which is the
ground of the whole Complaint. If the&s;e Men
could be talked to in their own Language; if
the odious Expre&s;&s;ions they u&s;e in their ordi|nary
Di&s;cour&s;e could be thrown in their Faces,
and they could be daub'd with their own
Dirt, it would de&s;cribe them in a more ef|fectual
manner, they would be painted in the
mo&s;t &s;uitable Colours, and dre&s;s'd up in the
Robes that would be&s;t become them; and, in
one re&s;pect, it ought to be &s;o, that every Crime
might be &s;hown as it really is.</P>
<P>IT was a Practice in &s;ome of the Nations in
the Ea&s;tern Countries, that if a Woman was
convicted of Adultery, &s;he was &s;tript &s;tark
naked, and led about the City, that &s;he might
be expo&s;ed in the &s;ame Nakedne&s;s in which &s;he
had voluntarily expo&s;ed her &s;elf, and &s;o be
puni&s;hed in the very kind of her Offence.</P>
<P>BUT this would not do in a Chri&s;tian Coun|try;
it would be it &s;elf an Offence again&s;t De|cency,
and a Breach of the very Mode&s;ty
which it was intended to puni&s;h, and therefore
it cannot be done; in like manner the Crime
I am reproving, cannot be expos'd in the lively
manner that other Offences are expos'd in; be|cau&s;e,
as I may &s;ay, we cannot &s;peak the Lan|guage:
The Dialect the&s;e People talk is a
great part of the Crime; and as it is not to be
made u&s;e of for their Reproof, &s;o we are &s;traiten'd
exceedingly in Reproving; and they triumph
over me in this very Part, that I talk in the
dark, and reprove by Allegory and Metaphor,
that People may know, or not know what I
mean, ju&s;t as it may happen.</P>
<P>THIS may, in &s;ome Sen&s;e, indeed be true,
as I have &s;aid above; but the Hard&s;hip ri&s;es
<PB N="387" REF="403">
from the black Circum&s;tances atrending the
Crimes they commit; and, of all People, they
&s;hould be the la&s;t to boa&s;t of that Advantage,
&s;eeing they mu&s;t own at the &s;ame time, 'tis be|cau&s;e
their Behaviour is &s;o much too vile to be
reproved, that it cannot be mentioned; the
Language of it is &s;o foul, that it will not read;
mode&s;t Tongues cannot &s;peak it; mode&s;t Ears
cannot hear it; like &s;ome particular Trials in
our Courts of Ju&s;tice, when they are obliged to
de&s;ire of the Women to withdraw, becau&s;e they
may be obliged to u&s;e &s;uch Expre&s;&s;ions as it is
not decent to mention before them, or mode&s;t
in them to be in the hearing of; and yet,
without which Words &s;poken in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t
and plaine&s;t manner, the Cau&s;e cannot be tried,
the Evidence be taken, or the Offender con|victed.</P>
<P>THIS is exactly the Ca&s;e; and under this
Difficulty the whole Work labours in almo&s;t
every Part. But I have taken the Part that, I
think, Religion and Decency directs; that is,
to go as far as I can, and leave Con&s;cience to
work the re&s;t its own way. I have painted out
the Crime as fairly as ju&s;tifiable Language will
allow; and where it will not, I content my &s;elf
with leaving the Guilty to judge them&s;elves by
the general Hints given them. The &s;ilent
Needle in the Compa&s;s points to the <HI>Pole,</HI> but
&s;ays no more; yet the Pilot, which knows its
meaning, &s;teers by that Direction, and brings the
Ship &s;afe into Port.</P>
<P>THE Facts are indeed notorious, and the le&s;s
plain <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> will &s;erve; the Things I reprove
are not &s;o very ab&s;tru&s;e; there are few married
People but will under&s;tand me; and all the
guilty, I am &s;ure, will read their Crimes plain
<PB N="388" REF="404">
enough, they will need no Explanations; if
they pretend to it, they will be too ea&s;ily con|futed,
by referring them to their own Prac|tice.</P>
<P>IT is true, there are &s;till &s;ome ill U&s;ages a|mong
the&s;e People, &s;ome Matrimonial Whore|doms
which are wholly omitted, which it is im|po&s;&s;ible
to mention, no not at the greate&s;t di&s;tance,
no not by Simily, Allegory, or any other Re|pre&s;entation.
They are too wicked to admit
the lea&s;t Sugge&s;tion about them, or &s;o much as
to guide the Reader to gue&s;s at them. Nor are
they a few Things which I am thus obliged to
overlook. But there is no doing it; they mu&s;t
be buried in Silence if they cannot be reprov'd,
becau&s;e they cannot be mentioned. Let the
Offenders, the guilty Per&s;ons, con&s;ider, Heaven
can find out Ways to puni&s;h them, tho' we can|not
find out Words to reprove them.</P>
<P>THAT Ju&s;tice, that brings to light the hid|den
Works of Darkne&s;s, can make the Crime
publick in the Puni&s;hment; and there it may
be read with Terror by every one that looks on
it, when their Ears will not be offended with
the De&s;cription. Nor is it an unu&s;ual Method;
Providence often thinks fit to do &s;o. Drunken|ne&s;s,
tho' in &s;ecret, is made publick by <HI>Solo|mon</HI>'s
Signals, <HI>Who has redne&s;s of eyes, who hath
wounds without cau&s;e? they that tarry long at the
Wine,</HI> &amp;c. Prov. xxiii. 29.</P>
<P>THUS it may be &s;aid again, who hath lean|ne&s;s
of Countenance, who hat rottenne&s;s of
Bones, who hath loath&s;ome Di&s;ea&s;es? Are they
not the People I &s;peak of? Let them take heed;
'tis not the Whorema&s;ter and the Strumpet a|lone
that contract Filthine&s;s and Di&s;tempers;
and 'twill be a dreadful Rebuke for a pretender
<PB N="389" REF="405">
to lawful Things, and no more, to &s;ee him&s;elf
brought to the &s;ame Di&s;tre&s;s by his Exce&s;&s;es,
that others are reduc'd by their Vices and open
Wickedne&s;&s;es, and loaded with tho&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es,
which &s;o &s;trongly intimate another kind of
Guilt, that no Body will believe him Innocent,
tho' he really be &s;o.</P>
<P>I leave it to Phy&s;icians to explain what
I &s;ay, and to tell whether there are not many
&s;candalous Di&s;ea&s;es which People bring upon
them&s;elves by their Intemperances and Ex|ce&s;&s;es,
which are &s;o near the main Contagion,
that no People will believe they are Innocent
that have them, and that yet may befal tho&s;e
who have never been guilty out of the Mar|riage
Bed.</P>
<P>LET &s;uch People reflect upon the Grief it
will be to them, to be univer&s;ally condemn'd
where they are not guilty; and to bear the
reproach of a Crime they have not committed
for the Crime which none imagine, and which
they have dwelt unreprov'd in &s;o many Years,
till they come to be a Reproof to them&s;elves,
and a Reproach to all about them.</P>
<P>I could give Examples of &s;everal who have
fatally &s;uffered in this Manner, under the
Weight of their own immoderate Practices, to
&s;ay no wor&s;e of them; and I could, I believe,
find &s;ome In&s;tances of tho&s;e who have peri&s;hed
under the Mi&s;ery, rather than di&s;cover the
Grief they lay under, lea&s;t they &s;hould be &s;up|po&s;ed
guilty of what they abhorred &s;o much as
to think of.</P>
<P>BUT how ju&s;t is divine Vengeance thus to
reprove tho&s;e Intemperances in his own Way.
which were otherwi&s;e out of the reach of hu|man
Laws, and indeed of human Eyes? And
<PB N="390" REF="406">
how &s;hould the People I &s;peak of, who&s;e Con|duct
I cannot reprove, becau&s;e too foul to be
mentioned, reflect, that Heaven can find out
Ways to make them a Puni&s;hment to them|&s;elves,
and join their Sin and their Shame to|gether?</P>
<P>I could have al&s;o given &s;ome living Examples
of the Intemperances which I have mentioned,
which have liv'd to be extreamly expo&s;ed, even
tho' they have not been &s;poken of in print; in
whom the di&s;temper'd Bodies, aching Heads, tot|tering
Joints, be&s;ides the many namele&s;s, fil|thy
and unclean Di&s;ea&s;es that have hung upon
them, have been their la&s;ting Reproof, and they
have carried the reproach of their Follies about
with them where-ever they went, till no Body
has car'd to come into their Company, and they
have been a Shame even to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>THESE Things have been the Fruit of tho&s;e
Doings, which they call lawful; their conjugal
Exce&s;&s;es, tho&s;e Liberties which they have all
along pretended Heaven allow'd them; Liberties
Nature dictated, Love prompted, and Matri|mony
made lawful; as if Heaven, Nature and
the Matrimonial Law, which is founded on the
Laws both of GOD and Nature, had directed
them to an immoderate U&s;e of the Liberties
they allow'd; which is no more true, than that
becau&s;e GOD gave the Wine (a noble Plant)
and the Juice of its Fruit, for our Comfort, and
for the &s;upport and &s;upply of the Spirits, had
allowed us to drink, and to drink it with Plea|&s;ure;
and that Nature, conforming to the Bounty
of Heaven, had given us a gu&s;t or love to the
Liquor it &s;elf; that therefore GOD and Nature
allowed us to be drunk, to drink to Exce&s;s,
<PB N="391" REF="407">
to drink away our Sen&s;e, our Under&s;tanding
and our Life, as many daily do.</P>
<P>I would conclude this with an earne&s;t and &s;e|rious
Monition to all the con&s;idering, rational
Part of Mankind, who call them&s;elves Chri|&s;tians,
and would be called &s;o, who are willing
to act as &s;uch, and to an&s;wer to them&s;elves, not
&s;uppo&s;ing they had any other Account to give
for all their Behaviour; I &s;ay, I would move them
to enter &s;o far into the Government of them&s;elves,
as becomes Men of Sen&s;e and of Virtue, to put
a due Re&s;traint upon them&s;elves in the u&s;e of
lawful Liberties, and to act, not like Madmen
and Furies, but like Men of Under&s;tanding,
to act in &s;uch a Manner, as they may not re|proach
them&s;elves hereafter with wa&s;ting their
Youth and Strength, and bringing Age and
Weakne&s;s upon them&s;elves before their Time.</P>
<P>CERTAINLY, GOD Almighty, who form'd
the Man, and who committed him, in a great
Mea&s;ure, to the Government of him&s;elf, did
not do &s;o with a general leave to live how he
plea&s;ed; did not leave him to the gu&s;t of his
Appetite, without giving the lea&s;t Limits to
him&s;elf by his Rea&s;on, but as he gave him
&s;uperior Faculties, &s;o he gave tho&s;e Faculties,
and placed them in a &s;uperiority one to another
that they might be a Check to the &s;eparate
Motions and Operations, and keep the whole
Machine in order.</P>
<P>IF the Man Breaks this Order; if he invert,
Nature; if he gives him&s;elf Liberties that
GOD and Nature intended him not, and &s;uch
as are incon&s;i&s;tent with the good Order of the
Machine, he will put the whole Fabrick out of
Tune; nor can he expect the re&s;t of the Moti|ons
can perform as they would otherwi&s;e do.</P>
<P><PB N="392" REF="408">
IF the Spring of a Watch be over &s;trained
it will cea&s;e to Draw if the Ballance be over|loaded,
the Motion &s;tops. It is the like in all
other natural Motions, and 'tis &s;o in this of
the Man. He that will put Nature out of her
proper Cour&s;e, and upon Extreams which &s;he
has not equal Powers to perform, will ruin tho&s;e
Powers which &s;he has, and, in a word, ruin the
whole Fabrick.</P>
<P>IF the Man is him&s;elf; if he is Ma&s;ter of
his Rea&s;on, and &s;ound Argument can make any
due Impre&s;&s;ion upon him, he will con&s;ider this
Part for his own &s;ake; ab&s;tracted from its being
an Offence again&s;t his Superior, the Governor of
his Life, to whom he mu&s;t Account; if, I &s;ay,
he would only con&s;ider him&s;elf, act like a ratio|nal
Creature, and &s;tudy his own Intere&s;t, it
mu&s;t move him to behave him&s;elf prudently.</P>
<P>I know nothing, no not one In&s;tance in
Life, wherein Virtue may be more truly &s;aid
to be its own Reward, than in this Particular:
Take the Ca&s;e inverted, who has length of Days,
who &s;ound Con&s;titution? who has &s;trength of
Body, agility of Limbs, who enjoys an unin|terrupted
Health, but the Temperate, the Mo|derate,
and the Virtuous? Their Vitals are not
exhau&s;ted; Nature is not oppre&s;s'd; the Vi|gour
of the Spirits expended, and the Marrow
of their Bones wa&s;ted: Their Youth has not
robbed their old Age; or their untimely Vice
diverted the Channels of Nature, and turn'd
the Water from the Mill.</P>
<P>THE Mode&s;t, the Cha&s;t, the temperate
Youth, is the hail, the chearful, and the healthy
old Man: He that lives too fa&s;t, goes to his
Grave too &s;oon; 'tis a cour&s;e, but &s;ignificant Ex|pre&s;&s;ion,
He that lives <HI>a Gallop,</HI> goes to the Devil <HI>a
<PB N="393" REF="409">
Trot.</HI> The meaning is plain; exce&s;s in Youth
anticipates old Age; they that will tear them|&s;elves
in Pieces, who can patch them up? 'Tis
in vain to fly to Art; Phy&s;ick may clean&s;e
the Blood, correct the noxious Humour, clear
the Stomach, and help the Dige&s;ture; but
Phy&s;ick cannot make the Body anew; Phy|&s;ick
cannot give a new Fund of Life, and form
Nature upon a new Foundation. Phy&s;ick can|not
re&s;tore when the Liver is wa&s;ted, when the
Lungs are &s;pit out of the Mouth by early
Catarrhs, when <HI>the Wheel is broken at the Ci&s;tern:</HI>
when, as <HI>Job</HI> &s;ays, <HI>the Reins are con&s;umed within
us,</HI> what can Phy&s;ick do for us? Art may a&s;|&s;i&s;t
Nature; but Art cannot give Youth, nor
re&s;tore that Vigour which Vice has exhau&s;ted.
When the <HI>Dart is &s;truck through the Liver,</HI>
when the Heart cea&s;es to beat Time to the
Pendulum, 'tis in vain to talk to Phy&s;icians:
As you have put your &s;elves in the Devil's
&s;tead to de&s;troy, Phy&s;icians cannot put them|&s;elves
in GOD'S &s;tead to <HI>Create:</HI> Who &s;hall &s;up|ply
in Age what the Spendthrift, the Extra|vagant
has wa&s;ted in Youth? A frugal U&s;e of an
E&s;tate pre&s;erves it for the Heirs; whereas he
that cuts the Timber down young, &s;hall have
no large high Trees to leave behind him; and he
that, without manuring and good Husbandry,
leaves the Land to be beggar'd, and plough'd out
of Heart, &s;hall be &s;ure not to keep up the Rent;
but the E&s;tate will decay, and the Heir be re|duc'd.</P>
<P>IN a Word, Temperance and Moderation
keeps Nature in a due &s;tate of Health, and lays
in an early Provi&s;ion for Time, a Stock for old
Age to live upon, hands on Vigour with the
Years, and makes Age triumph in the goodne&s;s
<PB N="394" REF="410">
of the Con&s;titution: Whereas Vice leaves
Youth groaning and mouring under Aches,
Rheumaticks and Hydrophicks before its Time,
the Joints trembling cannot &s;upport the Body,
the Nerves are innervated, the Sinews &s;hrunk;
in a Word, the Blood is poi&s;on'd, the Spirit ex|hau&s;ted,
and the whole Ma&s;s corrupted; thus the
Fabrick &s;inks like a Noble opulent City &s;wal|low'd
up in an Earthquake, there it &s;tands a &s;ad
Monument of the devouring Teeth of Crime,
and a Sacrifice to Debauchery.</P>
<P>WHENCE is it, that the Number of Phy&s;i|cians,
Apothecaries and Surgeons, are &s;o en|creas'd
among us, and e&s;pecially the latter, be|&s;ides
the innumerable Throng of Quacks, Pre|tenders
and Dealers in Plai&s;ters and Do&s;es? If
Di&s;ea&s;es were not multiply'd, the Remedies would
not crowd in upon us as they do; 'tis the Stench
of Carca&s;es that brings the <HI>Vultures</HI> about us
and our Families: As the Groans and Cries of
dying and decaying Bodies are loud among us;
&s;o Phy&s;ick is grown noi&s;y and clamorous.</P>
<P>HOW many Doctors and Surgeons, nay Apo|thecaries,
ride about in their Coaches? Perhaps,
as one cunningly alledg'd, not for the Vanity
of the Equipage, but for Expedition, and that
he might be able to make more Vi&s;its in a Day;
otherwi&s;e he could not di&s;patch his Bu&s;ine&s;s, or
&s;ee all his Patients &s;o often as they de&s;ir'd him.</P>
<P>AS our Yearly Bills are encrea&s;ed, the Phy|&s;icians
grown Rich, their Number more than
doubled, and their Equipages advanc'd in &s;uch a
Manner, Whence is it all? It cannot be all
meerly by the Encrea&s;e of People about us; tho'
that I know is alledged; there mu&s;t be &s;ome|thing
el&s;e; and the Rea&s;on is evident, our Lux|ury
is encrea&s;ed; and with our Luxury, our
<PB N="395" REF="411">
Vices, and other Extravagances, our La&s;civiou&s;|ne&s;s,
Sen&s;uality, and, in a Word, our Impu|dence,
and with all the&s;e our Di&s;tempers:
The&s;e enrich the Doctors, the&s;e call the Sur|geons
and Apothecaries about us, like the
Crows about the Carca&s;e; and they Bombard us
with the Gallipots and Gla&s;&s;es, as the <HI>Alge|rines</HI>
a&s;&s;ault a Ship with Carca&s;es and Stink|ing
Pots.</P>
<P>IF the Numbers of People are encreas'd a|bout
<HI>London,</HI> that may be &s;omething, though
'tis begging the Que&s;tion mo&s;t egregiou&s;ly to
&s;ay &s;o, as we do by Lump, that this is the only
encrea&s;e of the Mortality. Some &s;ugge&s;t &s;uch
an Encrea&s;e as amounts to a third Part of the
whole; and others will go &s;o far as to tell us
they are doubled; and this they gather (as they
&s;ay) not from the exce&s;&s;ive Numbers of Build|ings
only, but from the Throngs of People which
are to be &s;een in the Streets upon all publick
Occa&s;ions. I will readily grant both the&s;e, par|ticularly,
that there are great Numbers of new
Buildings, Streets and Squares added to the
Town, and in all the extreme Parts of it, in|deed
an innumerable Number, &s;uch as no City
in the World can &s;how the like, as at St.
<HI>Giles</HI>'s, Tyburn-Road, Ormond-Street, Hockley,
Finsbury, Spittle-Fields, Wapping, Rotherbith, &amp;c.
Nor is this all, but I allow that there is al&s;o a
prodigious Encrea&s;e in the Villages adjacent to
<HI>London,</HI> which, as they &s;ay, and in that indeed
they &s;ay true, are not only doubled, but &s;ome
of them encrea&s;ed to &s;everal Times as many Peo|ple
as formerly, &s;uch as at the new Docks near
<HI>Deptford,</HI> and at the Town of <HI>Deptford;</HI> al&s;o
at <HI>Greenwich, Clapham, Camberwell, Chel&s;ea, Ken|&s;ington,
Hamp&s;tead, Newington, Tottenham, Ed|monton,
Endfield, Bromley, Stratford, We&s;t Ham,
<PB N="396" REF="412">
Wan&s;tead, Waltham&s;tow, Low-Layton,</HI> and abun|dance
more, all who&s;e Pari&s;hes are out of
the Bills of Mortality; and were their Num|bers
added to the la&s;t yearly Bill, would make
up the Mortalities at lea&s;t to Five and thirty
thou&s;and.</P>
<P>NOW tho' all this were true, and more, yet it
does not at all account for the Grievance in our
Morals, which I have complained of; or for
the Depredations made upon Nature, and upon
Health, by our intemperate and luxurious
Living, our immoderate and &s;candalous Ex|ce&s;&s;es
in otherwi&s;e lawful and allowed Plea|&s;ures.
But let tho&s;e that que&s;tion it, look back
into the Book of Nature; and let them tell me,
whether the Numbers of the Sick too are not
encrea&s;ed in proportion, and indeed more than
in proportion, to the Number of the Dead?
And if they will not take my Opinion, let
them know the late famous Dr. <HI>Radcliffe,</HI>
and &s;everal other Phy&s;icians, gave the &s;ame
Judgment. And I am very willing to appeal
to the Learned, whether the&s;e Exce&s;&s;es I have
now mentioned, have not contributed at lea&s;t
to making the Age le&s;s &s;ound in Life, if not
&s;horter liv'd than their Ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>I will not attempt to abridge the Sovereignty
of Providence in its Government of the Earth;
or to &s;ay, that Heaven has not appointed and
limited the Time of Life to all his Creatures:
Yet I am not &s;o much a Prede&s;tinarian nei|ther,
as to pretend that Men cannot &s;horten
their Days by Luxury and Intemperance, Glut|tony,
Drunkenne&s;s, and other wor&s;e and more
criminal Exce&s;&s;es; why &s;hould we not think
that &s;uch Crimes as the&s;e entail Heaven's Cur&s;e
upon us, and bla&s;t our Breath, and &s;horten our
Time, as well as Di&s;obedience to Parents? I
<PB N="397" REF="413">
will not pre&s;ume to &s;ay, in the Words of the
Command, be <HI>Temperate,</HI> be <HI>Virtuous,</HI> be <HI>Mo|derate,
that thy Days may be long in the Land.</HI>
I acknowledge, that I have no direct Autho|rity
to add a Promi&s;e to the Exhortation; but I
may take more freedom, I believe, in the alter|native,
and &s;ay, be not Intemperate, be not Vi|cious,
Luxurious, Immoderate and Brutal, and
add, with the Wi&s;e Man, <HI>Why &s;hould'&s;t thou dye
before thy Time?</HI> Eccle&s;. vii. 17.</P>
<P>WITHOUT que&s;tion, Life may be &s;hortened
by our Wickedne&s;s. How many do we &s;ee, in
almo&s;t every weekly Bill, dead of exce&s;&s;ive
Drinking, others Duelling and Fighting;
&s;ome by one vile Exce&s;s, &s;ome by another?
Shall any Man dare to &s;ay, the&s;e did not &s;horten
their own Lives! Shall we &s;ay, they <HI>lived out
half their Days!</HI> P&s;al. lv. 23. I think it would
be affronting the Ju&s;tice of Providence, to &s;ay,
they were not &s;lain by their own Crime, cut off
by untimely Vice, or that, with <HI>David</HI>'s wicked
Men, they do not live out half their Days.</P>
<P>BUT, not to enter into Di&s;putes of Things
remote to the Ca&s;e; if Life is or is not, can
or cannot be &s;horten'd by our Intemperance
and Vice, the Comfort of Life may be le&s;&s;en'd.
Life may be made a Burthen, loath&s;ome and
uncomfortable, by loading it with Di&s;ea&s;es
and Sorrows, and by bringing complicated
Mi&s;eries upon our &s;elves in the Room of
Health and Vigour, which would otherwi&s;e be
the Lot.</P>
<P>A bright Countenance, a &s;prightly and brisk
Eye, a con&s;tant Smile, a nimble agile Body, a
clear Head, a &s;trong Memory, and clean Limbs,
the&s;e are Nature's Furniture to a Man of an
untainted Race. But how often are all the&s;e
<PB N="398" REF="414">
original Beauties, the native Attendants upon
Youth and a good Con&s;titution, made to droop
and flag, while Palene&s;s and Leanne&s;s come
into the Face, Heavine&s;s into the Heart, and
Dulne&s;s into the Head? How is the &s;hining
&s;parkling of the Eye eclip&s;ed, the Under&s;tand|ing
lo&s;t, the Memory decay'd, and the Genius
partaking of the Contagion, entirely al|tered?</P>
<P>THE <HI>Glory of a young Man is his Strength,</HI>
&s;ays <HI>Solomon,</HI> Prov. xx. 29. and one of his fir&s;t
Advices after that Expre&s;&s;ion, is, <HI>give not thy
Strength unto Women;</HI> it is ture, <HI>Solomon</HI> there
means to a &s;trange Woman, that is to &s;ay, <HI>a
Whore.</HI> But with &s;ome abatement for the Per&s;on
only, and for the Circum&s;tances &s;poken to here;
the Thing is (otherwi&s;e) the &s;ame, and the Ex|ce&s;&s;es
are in their Degree tho' perhaps not
every way as fatal.</P>
<P>IT was a late learned Phy&s;ician who &s;aid,
that the Women wearing Hoops would make
the next Age all Cripples; that drinking Tea
would make them Rheumatick; that taking
Snuff would make them Lunatick: To which it
was &s;aid, by way of Repartee, the Doctor being a
little of a Libertine, that the Levity of the
pre&s;ent Times will make the next Age Athei&s;ts;
the Cavilling at Scripture, (which is now the
grand Mode) make them Hereticks; and
the talking Non&s;en&s;e make them all Fools:
And now, I think, I may with equal Propriety
add, that the Vice of this Age will make the
next Age rotten.</P>
<P>CRIME has an unhappy propagating Qua|lity;
'tis always in progre&s;&s;ion. If one Age
talks Here&s;y, the next Age talks Bla&s;phemy:
If one Age talks Faction, the next Age talks
<PB N="399" REF="415">
Trea&s;on: If one Age talks Fooli&s;h, the next
Age talks Mad. So, in the Ca&s;e before
me, if one Generation are Immoderate, the
next are Extravagant. If one Age runs to ex|ce&s;s
in Things lawful, the next pur&s;ues the like
exce&s;&s;es in Things unlawful, or make tho&s;e
lawful Things Crimes, by tho&s;e exce&s;&s;es: If one
Age are Bea&s;ts, the next Age are Devils: To|day
Matrimonial Whoredom, To-morrow Un|bounded
Whoredom. As Vice leads, Fools fol|low;
and where mu&s;t it end but in De&s;tru|ction?</P>
<P>IT is the like in the Contamination of Blood;
the fatal Progre&s;&s;ion &s;hows it &s;elf there, as well
as in other Parts. Exce&s;&s;es weaken the Body, &s;ink
Nature, darken the Countenance, &s;tupify the
Brain; To-day they reach the Body, To-mor|row
the Soul, and, in the next Age, the
Race.</P>
<P>THE lawful Things of this Age will make
the next Age lawle&s;s; their Fathers conveyed
Blood, and they convey Poy&s;on; our Parents
handed on Health, and we Di&s;ea&s;es; our Chil|dren
are born in Palaces, and are like to die in
Ho&s;pitals. Debauchery is the Parent of Di|&s;temper;
Fire in the Blood makes a Fro&s;t in
the Brain; and be the Plea&s;ures lawful or un|lawful,
the effect of Folly is to leave a Gene|ration
of Fools.</P>
<P>IT would be happy, if after having &s;aid
thus much in general, and after having enter'd
&s;o &s;eriou&s;ly into all the Particulars by which
a lewd Generation defile and pollute the Mar|riage
Bed, and ruin both them&s;elves and their
Po&s;terity, I could propo&s;e &s;ome effectual Me|thod
for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the wicked Practices,
<PB N="400" REF="416">
and bring Mankind to live, at lea&s;t like
rea&s;onable Creatures, if not as Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>THE An&s;wer to this would be direct, if
Laws and Government were concerned in it.
But as we complain of an Evil which the
&s;en&s;e of GOD'S Laws, nor the force of human
Laws, will not reach, nothing of Force, no|thing
of putting Statutes in execution, no|thing
of the Hand of the Magi&s;trate can be
thought of u&s;e, or, if it be, will be equally
laugh'd at. Indeed, how &s;hould they that
can Argue them&s;elves out of all the Re|&s;traints
of Virtue and Religion, be expected
to be under any Re&s;traints, except tho&s;e of
Power?</P>
<P>AND this makes me have recour&s;e to Sa|tyr,
and the Reproofs and La&s;hes of the Pen.
The&s;e are the proper Weapons to combat
this Adver&s;ary: Where the Laws of GOD or
Man have no Effect, the Satyr has been
&s;ometimes known to reach the Affections and
Pa&s;&s;ions of Men; as they run in &s;everal
Channels, &s;o they are to be come at by &s;e|veral
Methods; Ways and Means for one
Thing will not be always Ways and Means
for another; as Men are wrought upon,
&s;ome by one Thing, &s;ome by another, ac|cording
to the &s;everal Tempers and Di&s;po&s;i|tions
which govern them, and in which they
act; &s;o, in general, they are mov'd, &s;ome in
one Way, &s;ome in another.</P>
<P>NATIONAL Mi&s;takes, vulgar Errors, and
even a general Practice, have been reform'd
by a ju&s;t Satyr. None of our Countrymen

that calls for Cen&s;ure among Men; I

<P>NONE but a Set of People with Faces of
Steel, who can triumph in their Victory over

Eternity, that have got the Better both of Edu|cation,

Blu&s;h for, and reprove them. This univer&s;al
Contempt of them; this general Aver&s;ion, if any
Thing on Earth can work upon them, will have
&s;ome Effect; there are few guilty Men har|den'd
again&s;t the Battery of general Clamour;
it &s;eems to be an A&s;&s;ault to be re&s;i&s;ted only
by Innocence; Crime mu&s;t certainly fall
under it; Innocence may hold up the
Head in &s;uch a Storm; but Guilt will cer|tainly
and &s;oon founder, and &s;uffer Ship|wreck.</P>
<P>INDEED, there &s;eems to be &s;ome affinity
in Crime, between the People who We are now
Cen&s;uring, and another horrid modern Genera|tion
too vile to name, and yet who &s;eems
to be &s;eeking Protection under the&s;e. There
may be indeed an e&s;&s;ential Difference; but in
what &s;mall and minute Articles does it exi&s;t?
But as the Particulars will not admit a nearer
Enquiry, I think the better Way is to reject
both with Contempt, with an Abhorrence &s;uit|able
to the vilene&s;s of the Facts, and ca&s;t
them out together.</P>
<P>THIS will aid the mode&s;t Part of the World
in their ju&s;t Oppo&s;ition to all Indecency;
and if we did nothing el&s;e, our Work would
recommend it&s;elf to that Part of Mankind
which are really mo&s;t valuable; and as for
the re&s;t, let them act as they plea&s;e, their
Approbation will add no Credit to the
Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>I have now done. I have &s;aid not all I
had to &s;ay, but all I have Room to &s;ay here;
and having brought the very Conclu&s;ion to
a Clo&s;e, I would only add one Thing by
<PB N="404" REF="420">
way of Challenge to that Part of Mankind,
who I may have touch'd in this Satyr, and
who, for ought I know, may be angry; for,
indeed, they have nothing el&s;e left for it, but
to be angry, and rail at the Reproof; ac|cording
to a known Di&s;tich u&s;ed upon a like
Occa&s;ion:
<Q><L>That Di&s;putants, when Rea&s;ons fail,</L>
<L>Have one &s;ure Refuge left, and that's to Rail.</L></Q></P>
<P>NOW in this Ca&s;e, I &s;ay, I have a fair Offer to
make to tho&s;e Gentlemen in a few Words, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>1. LET them prove that the Fact here repre|hended
is not in being; that 'tis all a Fiction or
Shadow, a Man of Straw; that there's nothing
in it, and that I am in the wrong. Or,</P>
<P>2. THAT if it is in being, that tho' the Fact
is true, and tho' &s;uch Things are done, they merit
no Satyr, that they ought not to be reproved or
expo&s;ed; I &s;ay, let them do this, and then they
&s;hall Rail their fill, and treat Me, and the Work
which I have ju&s;t now fini&s;hed, in as &s;candalous
a manner as they plea&s;e. Or,</P>
<P>3. Which I had much rather they &s;hould do,
let them REFORM; take the hint, fall under
the Reproof, and at once &s;ink the Crime.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, it &s;eems rational that one or other
of the&s;e &s;hould be done: The two fir&s;t, which
are in &s;ome re&s;pect the &s;ame, I am out of fear
of; the la&s;t &s;eems a Debt; 'tis ju&s;t I &s;hould de|mand
it; let them repel the Charge, or re|form
the Practice.</P>
<P><PB N="405" REF="421">
IF they cannot do the fir&s;t, and yet contemn
the la&s;t, I declare War again&s;t them; and if I
live to appear again in the Field, let them ex|pect
no Quarter; for the Satyr has not &s;pent all
its Artillery, or &s;hot all its Shafts. My next
Attack &s;hall be per&s;onal, and I may come to
Black Lists, Hi&s;tories of Facts, Regi&s;ters of
Time, with Name and Sirname; for no Man
&s;ure, in a Chri&s;tian Government, as this is,
need be afraid of laying Hell open, or draw|ing
the Pictures of Men when they are turn'd
Devils.</P>
<P>I might &s;ay a Word or two more with re&s;pect
to Style. I think I can have given no Offence
in Decency of Expre&s;&s;ion: If any Thing has,
notwith&s;tanding the utmo&s;t Care, &s;lipt my Pen,
let it be a Defence, that I profe&s;s it is unde|&s;ign'd;
the whole Tenour of the Work is cal|culated
to bear down Vice, vitious Practi&s;es and
vitious Language; and, I think, I may claim
a favourable Con&s;truction where there &s;eems a
Fault, if it were really a &s;lip of the Pen: I
may claim it as a Debt due to a mode&s;t Inten|tion;
declaring again, there is not one Word
willingly pa&s;s'd over that can be Cen&s;ured, as
evidently leading to or encouraging Indecency,
no not in Thought. An evil Mind may cor|rupt
the cha&s;te&s;t De&s;ign; as in reading the ex|planation
of the Words <HI>I WILL,</HI> in the Mar|riage
Covenant, which, I &s;ay, is a &s;olemn Oath,
and that as plain as if it had been expre&s;s'd, as
&s;wearing by the Name of GOD. Sure none can
be offended as if I put the &s;acred Name of GOD
into the Mouths of the Readers upon a light
Occa&s;ion, making them take the Name of GOD
in vain, or making them repeat an Oath in the
mo&s;t vulgar and cour&s;e&s;t way. But if any Man
<PB N="406" REF="422">
&s;hould be &s;o weak, not to &s;ay malicious, let
them know, that I think the Expre&s;&s;ion car|ries
with it a due reverence of the Name of
GOD; and that the Occa&s;ion is awful and &s;o|lemn;
and if I had &s;aid, <HI>So help me,</HI> GOD, it
had been the &s;ame thing: The meaning is, to
convince Men that how flight however they
pa&s;s over the Marriage Covenant, it is a &s;olemn
Appeal to GOD for the Truth of the Intention;
and a &s;olemn binding them&s;elves in his Name
and Pre&s;ence, to a &s;trict Performance of the
Conditions; and that he that breaks them breaks
a mo&s;t &s;acred Oath, and is as much Perjured as
if he had been &s;o in the ordinary Form.</P>
