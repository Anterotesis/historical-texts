<HEAD>THE LIFE
OF
CHRISTOPHER SMART.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the life of an Author &s;eldom abounds
with very intere&s;ting events, yet of tho&s;e who have
undertaken to in&s;truct or to amu&s;e mankind, &s;ome ac|count
will be expected. Biography is generally con&s;i|dered
as one of the mo&s;t entertaining &s;ubjects of Lite|rature:
but its utility may perhaps be que&s;tioned.
Concerning per&s;ons of humble and common attain|ments
we are not wont to be &s;olicitous; and the im|portant
actions of eminent characters few readers will
be able to imitate. Of the&s;e however the Hi&s;torian is
be&s;t informed, and treats them with the greate&s;t &s;atis|ction.
Yet he is &s;eldom the fir&s;t of men, who mo&s;t.
attracts the attention of the public. For, if great
talents be nece&s;&s;arily rare, the opportunities are &s;till
rarer of di&s;playing them to the world; to this a
multitude of events, who&s;e connection is impercepti|ble
<PB N="vi" REF="6">
to human eyes, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily concur. The ex|ternal
di&s;tinctions therefore between man and man are
derived le&s;s from nature than from fortune; &s;o that
mo&s;t, if not all, of tho&s;e characters which are held up
to public view, may be con&s;idered as a picture of the
human &s;pecies. To extract from Biography all its
advantages, let the writer re&s;train his fancy, and the
reader his admiration; let not the fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that
he de&s;cribes a perfect model, nor the latter forget
that he contemplates a man.</P>
<P>Mr. Christopher Smart, the Author of the follow|ing
Poems, was born at Shipbourne in Kent, the 11th
of April, 1722.</P>
<P>His Father was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an e&s;tate of about
3001. a year in that neighbourhood, and having been
originally intended for Holy Orders, had a better
ta&s;te for literature than is commonly found in country
gentlemen; a ta&s;te which, he tran&s;mitted to his Son.</P>
<P>In the beginning of his life our Author was of a
very delicate con&s;titution, having been born earlier
than the natural period; and his body being too fee|ble
to permit his indulging freely in childi&s;h amu&s;e|ments,
his mind had lei&s;ure to exerci&s;e and expand
its powers. He di&s;covered a very early ta&s;te for
$$etry; and proved when he was only four years
old, by an extemporary effu&s;ion, that even then he had
a reli&s;h for Ver&s;e and an ear for Numbers. He was
educated at Maid&s;tone, till he was $leven years old:
<PB N="vii" REF="7">
on the death of his Father, which happened at that
time, his Mother, Mrs. Winifred Smart, determined
to &s;end him to Durham, where he would have the
advantages of a good &s;chool, change of air to
&s;trengthen a weakly frame, and the notice and pro|tection
of his Father's relations. The family had
been long e&s;tabli&s;hed in that country. An ance&s;tor
of his, Mr. Peter Smart, had been a Prebendary of
Durham in the reign of Charles the fir&s;t; and for
re&s;i&s;ting innovations in the church wor&s;hip &s;uffered
con&s;iderably both in per&s;on and in property; of this
he publi&s;hed an interelling narrative in a pamphlet,
of which few copies now remain. Mr. Smart's
Grandfather married a Mi&s;s Gilpin, of the family of
the celebrated Barnard Gilpin, Rector of Houghton
le Spring. The enumeration of ance&s;itors, remark|able
only for rank or fortune, is idle o&s;tentation; but
to mention the brave and the good is a tribute due
to merit, and a favour to mankind.</P>
<P>As our Author's Father had been Steward of the
e&s;tates in Kent of Lord Barnard, afterwards Earl of
Darlington, the Son was very cordially received at
Raby Ca&s;tle, when ab&s;ent, during the holidays, from
School. In this noble family he had the honour of
making an acquaintance with the late Dutche&s;s of
Cleveland, who di&s;cerned and patronized his talents.
She allowed him forty pounds a year till her death.
In the Ode to Lord Barnard, he alludes beautifully to
<PB N="viii" REF="8">
his literary habits and to the &s;plendor of his connec|tions
at this early period of his life.</P>
<P>Mr. Smart did not continue without di&s;tinction at
Durham School; and a very learned and eminent
Divine, now living, has expre&s;&s;ed obligations to our
Author for his own fir&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful e&s;&s;ays in Latin
Ver&s;ification. The Ma&s;ter of the School at that
time was the Rev. Mr. Dongworth, an Etonian, and
&s;o eminent a &s;cholar, that in the judgment of one,
who was him&s;elf in that &s;tation, he would have ob|tained
the Ma&s;ter&s;hip of that celebrated Seminary,
had it been acce&s;&s;ible to &s;imple merit.</P>
<P>Mr. Smart was removed from this place to the
University of Cambridge, when he was &s;eventeen;
being admitted of Pembroke Hall, Oct. 30, 1739.</P>
<P>Though the favourite &s;tudies of this Seat of Learn|ing
were not congenial with his mind, yet his cla&s;&s;ical
attainments and poetical powers were &s;o eminent, as
to attract the notice of per&s;ons, not very &s;trongly pre|judiced
in favour of &s;uch accompli&s;hments. Such was
the force of his genius, and &s;uch the vivacity of his
di&s;po&s;ition, that his company was very earne&s;tly &s;oli|cited;
and to &s;uppre&s;s or with-hold our talents, when
the di&s;play of them is repaid by admiration, is com|monly
too great an effort for human prudence. He
was therefore quickly involved in habits and ex|peces,
of which he felt the con&s;equences during the
re&s;t of his life. His allowance from home was &s;canty;
<PB N="ix" REF="9">
for as his father had died &s;uddenly, and in embarra&s;&s;ed
circum&s;tances, his widowed mother had been com|pelled
to &s;ell the large&s;t portion of the e&s;tate at con&s;i|derable
lo&s;s. Our Author's chief dependance was
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance he derived from his College, and from
the Duche&s;s of Cleveland's bounty. Many di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
characters now living were notwith&s;tanding
of his intimate acquaintance; and it appears, by the
Latin invitation of a friend to &s;upper, pre&s;erved
among his works, that he knew how to reli&s;h the
Fea&s;t of Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>In the early part of his re&s;idence at Cambridge
he wrote the Tripos<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The Ver&s;es &s;o called are compo&s;itions publi&s;hed every year, when the Bachelors of Arts have compleated their de|grees. Young men of poetical talents are appointed to this employment; and on one &s;ide of their paper, the names are printed of tho&s;e &s;tudents, who at the public examination, on the occa&s;ion ju&s;t mentioned, have &s;ucceeded the be&s;t.</NOTE> Poems in the pre&s;ent Col|lection.
The&s;e ver&s;es have more &s;y&s;tem and de|&s;ign
than is generally found in the compo&s;itions of
young Academics: and it is &s;ome argument of their
being well approved, that they were all thought
worthy of a translation into Engli&s;h. He was en|couraged
by the commendations of his friends, to
offer him&s;elf a Candidate for a Univer&s;ity Scholar|&s;hip.
The yearly value of the&s;e appointments is
barely 20l.; but the election is open to the whole
Univer&s;ity under the degree of Ma&s;ter of Arts; and
<PB N="x" REF="10">
as the electors are of approved learning, and fix their
choice after the &s;tricte&s;t &s;crutiny, the honour of ob|taining
the&s;e Scholar&s;hips is con&s;iderable. It has
been &s;aid that upon this occa&s;ion he tran&s;lated Mr.
Pope's Ode on St. Cecilia's Day; but I do not find
any &s;ufficient authority for &s;uch a conjecture; which
is rendered improbable by the length and labour of
the composition. But that a &s;cholar equal to &s;uch a
work, in an impartial cla&s;&s;ical examination &s;hould &s;ur|pa&s;s
his competitors, is no matter of &s;urprize.&mdash;His
extraordinary &s;ucce&s;s in this poem, induced him to
turn his mind to eother Tran&s;lations from that fa|vourite
Bard; and he &s;eems to have written to Mr.
Pope for his approbation. He received from that
gentleman the following Letter:&mdash;</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE>&startq;TWICKENHAM, <DATE>Nov. 18th.</DATE>&endq;</DATELINE>
<SALUTE>&startq;SIR,&endq;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>&startq;I thank you for the favour of yours;&endq; I would not
give you the trouble of tran&s;lating the whole E&s;&s;ay
you mention; the two firss;t Epi&s;tles are already well
done, and if you try, I could wi&s;h it were on the la&s;t,
which is le&s;s ab&s;tracted, and more ea&s;ly falls into
poetry and common place. A few lines at the be|ginning
and the conclu&s;ion, will be &s;ufficient for a
trial whether you your&s;elf can like the ta&s;k or not.
I believe the E&s;&s;ay on Critici&s;m will in general be
the more agreeable, both to a young writer, and to
<PB N="xi" REF="11">
$he majority of readers. What made me wi&s;h the
other well done, was the want of a right under&s;tand|ing
of the &s;ubject, which appears in the foreign ver|sions,
in two Italian, two French, and one German.
$There is one indeed in Latin ver&s;e printed at Wir|femberg,
very faithful, bat inelegant; and another
in French pro&s;e; but in the&s;e the &s;pirit of Poetry is
as much lo&s;t, as the &s;en&s;e and &s;y&s;tem it&s;elf in the
others. I ought to take this opportunity of acknow|ledging
the Latin Tran&s;lation of my Ode, which you
&s;ent me, and in which I could &s;ee little or nothing to
alter, it is &s;o exact. Believe me, Sir, equally de&s;irous
of doing you any &s;ervice, and afraid of engaging you
in an art &s;o little profitable, tho' &s;o well de&s;erving, as
good poetry.&endq;</P>
<CLOSER>I am,
Your mo&s;t: obliged
and &s;incere humble &s;ervant,
<SIGNED>A. POPE.&endq;</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>I do not find that he be&s;towed any farther notice
on our Author, excepting that he received him once
very civilly at his hou&s;e; and Mr. Smart &s;eems to
have been induced by his &s;ugge&s;tion to undertake
and fini&s;h the Latin tran&s;lation of the E&s;&s;ay on Cri|tici&s;m;
with much prai&s;e from the learned, but with|out
either profit or popularity, He was admitted to
<PB N="xii" REF="12">
the Degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1743, and was
elected Fellow of Pembroke-Hall, July 3, 1745.</P>
<P>About this time he wrote a Comedy, of which no
remains have yet been found, but a few of the Songs,
and the Soliloquy of the Prince&s;s Perriwinkle, pre|&s;erved
in the Old Woman's Magazine, which is in|&s;erted
below.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>The Prince&s;s Perriwinkle &s;ola, attended by fourteca Maids of great honour.</P>
<L>Sure &s;uch a wretch as I was never born,</L>
<L>By all the world de&s;erted and forlorn;</L>
<L>This bitter-&s;weet, this honey-gall to prove,</L>
<L>And all the oil and vinegar of love.</L>
<L><HI>Pride, Love</HI> and <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> will not let me re&s;t,</L>
<L>But make a dev'li&s;h bu&s;tle in my brea&s;t.</L>
<L>To wed with Fizgig, <HI>Pride, Pride, Pride</HI> denies,</L>
<L>Put on a Spani&s;h padlock, <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> cries;</L>
<L>But tender gentle <HI>Love</HI> with every wi&s;h complies.</L>
<L><HI>Pride, Love</HI> and <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> fight till they are cloy'd,</L>
<L>And each by each in mutual wounds de&s;troy'd.</L>
<L>Thus when a Barber and a Collier fight,</L>
<L>The Barber beats the luckle&s;s Collier&mdash;white.</L>
<L>The du&s;ty Collier heaves his pond'rous &s;ack,</L>
<L>And, big with vengeance, beats the Barber&mdash;black.</L>
<L>In comes the Brickdu&s;t man, with grime o'er&s;pread,</L>
<L>And beats the Collier and the Barber&mdash;red.</L>
<L>Black, red and white in various clouds arc to&s;s'd,</L>
<L>And in the du&s;t they rai&s;e, the combatants are lo&s;t.</L>
<P>The following account of the Plot, and Dramatis Per&s;onae, in the words of an eminent per&s;on, who was an actor in it, may not be unacceptable to our readers. &startq;It was called <HI>A Trip to Cambridge,</HI> or the <HI>Grateful Fair.&endq;</HI> The bu&s;ine&s;s of the Drama was laid in bringing up an old country Baronet to admit his nephew a Fellow Commoner at one of the Col|leges; in which expedition a daughter or niece attended. In their approach to the &s;eat of the Mu&s;es, the waters from a heavy rain happened to be out at Fen&s;tanton, which gave a young &s;tudent of Emmanuel an opportunity of &s;hewing his gal|lantry as he was riding out, by jumping from his hor&s;e and plunging into the flood to re&s;cue the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed dam&s;el, who was near peri&s;hing in the &s;tream, into which &s;he had fallen from her poney, as the party travelled on hor&s;eback. The &s;wain being lucky enough to effect his purpo&s;e, of cour&s;e gained an intere&s;t in the lady's heart, and an acquaintance with the re&s;t of the family, which he did not fail to cultivate on their arrival at Cambridge, with &s;ucce&s;s as far as the fair one was concerned. To bring about the con&s;ent of the father, (or guardian, for my memory is not accurate) it was contrived to have a play acted, of which entertainment he was highly &s;ond; and the Norwich company luckily came to Cambridge ju&s;t at the time; only one of the actors had been detained on the road; and they could not perform (the play that night, unle&s;s the Baronet would con&s;ent to take a part; which, ra|ther than be di&s;appointed of his favourite amu&s;ement, he was prevailed upon to do, e&s;pecially as he was a&s;&s;ured that it would amount to nothing more than &s;ittin$ $word$ a great table, and &s;ignuing an in&s;trument, as a Ju&s;tice of Peace might &s;ign a warrant: and, having been &s;ome years of the Quorum, he felt him&s;elf quite equal to the undertaking. The under play to be acted by the Norwich company on this occa&s;ion, was the <HI>Bloody War of the King of Diamonds with the King of Spades;</HI> and the actors in it came on with their re&s;pective emblems on their &s;houlders, taken from the &s;uits of the cards they repre&s;ented. The Ba|ronet was the King of one of the parties, and in &s;igning a de|claration of war, &s;igned his con&s;ent to the marriage of his niece or daughter, and a &s;urrender of all her fortune.</P>
<P>After many di&s;appointments in attempting to get an old play-hou&s;e at Hannibun's the coach-maker's, and afterwards the Free-School in Free School-Lane, it was acted in Pem|broke College-Hall, the parlour of which made the Green Room. The Dramatis Per&s;onae, as far as I recollect them, were</P>

In 1753 he quitted College, on his marriage with
Mi&s;s Anna Maria Carnan, the daughter by a former
hu&s;band, of Mary, the wife of the late Mr. John
Newbery. He was introduced to this gentleman's
acquaintance by Dr. Burney, the celebrated and
learned author of the General Hi&s;tory of Mu&s;ic, who
&s;et for Mr. Smart &s;everal &s;ongs, and has enriched
the pre&s;ent collection with &s;ome original compo&s;itions.</P>
<P>As Mr. Smart had relinqui&s;hed his Fellow&s;hip with|out
engaging in any of the profe&s;&s;ions, he &s;eems to
have tru&s;ted for his future maintenance to his powers
as an author.&mdash;But he had either over-rated his own
abilities and per&s;everance, or the favour of the pub|lic.
&mdash;Though Mr. Newbery, to whom he was now
allied, was him&s;elf a man of genius and a liberal patron
of genius in others; yet the difficulties that had
perplexed Mr. Smart at Cambridge pur&s;ued him to
London; to which the expence of a family was &s;uper-added.
Yet &s;uch was his thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s, that he
has often, as his widow relates, invited company to
<PB N="xix" REF="19">
dinner, when no means appeared of providing a meal
for them&s;elves. About this time he wrote for the <HI>Student,</HI> or <HI>Oxford and Cambridge Mi&s;cellany;</HI> a peri|odical
work of con&s;iderable reputation, in which
many of the wits of both the Univer&s;ities di&s;played
their talents. To the <HI>Old Woman's Magazine,</HI> pub|li&s;hed
at the &s;ame period, Mr. Newbery and him&s;elf
were the chief, if not the only contributors. He
tran&s;lated al&s;o the works of Horace into Engli&s;h
pro&s;e, a ta&s;k which he has very ably executed; but
of that kind which never will be prai&s;ed in propor|tion
to the labour. By few and appo&s;ite terms
Smart has expre&s;&s;ed the &s;entiments of Horace, in an
idiom not placed very near the Roman in the table of
grammatical affinities. Of an author not among the
lea&s;t difficult, he is at once an accurate and an ele|gant
tran&s;lator; and though he engaged in the un|dertaking
when a very young man, he &s;hews the
humble&s;t attention to the language of the original,
and an ab&s;olute command ever his own.</P>
<P>He enjoyed, while thus engaged in the metropolis, the
familiar acquaintance of Dr. John&s;on, Dr. James, Dr.
Gold&s;mith, and Mr. Garrick; and indeed of mo&s;t,
who were then celebrated for genius, or for learning.
of Mr. Garrick's extreme par&s;imony much has been
told, in an occupation, where oeconomy is not u&s;ually
ranked among the virtues. To this opinion may be
oppo&s;ed the fact of his offering to Mr. Smart, when
<PB N="xx" REF="20">
under the pre&s;&s;ure of &s;evere di&s;tre&s;s, the profits of a
free benefit at Drury-Lane Theatre; an offer which
his friends did not permit him to refu&s;e. Upon this
occa&s;ion Mr. Garrick introduced on the &s;tage for
the fir&s;t time the &s;hort Drama of the <HI>Guardian;</HI> and performed in it him&s;elf the principal character.</P>
<P>Among the noble friends of Mr. Smart may be
reckoned the pre&s;ent Lord Delavai, to whom he was
private tutor in College, and who &s;nowed him upon
various occa&s;ions particular in&s;tances of regard. It
was at the reque&s;t of this Nobleman that he wrote a
Prologue and Epilogue to the Tragedy of Othello,
acted at Drury-Lane Theatre by &s;everal per&s;ons of
quality; the parts of Othello and Iago being filled by
Sir Francis Delaval and his Lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>Though the fortune as well as con&s;titution of Mr.
Smart required the utmo&s;t care, he was equally neg|ligent
in the management of both, and his various
and repeated embarra&s;&s;ments acting upon an imagi|nation
uncommonly fervid, produced temporary alie|nations
of mind; which at la&s;t were attended with
paroxy&s;ms &s;o violent and continued as to render con|finement
nece&s;&s;ary. In this melancholy &s;tate, his fa|mily,
for he had now two children, mu&s;t have been
much embarra&s;&s;ed in their circum&s;tances, but for the
kind friend&s;hip and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mr. Newbery. Many
other of Mr. Smart's acquaintance were likewi&s;e for|ward
in their &s;evices; and particulartly Dr. Samuel
<PB N="xxi" REF="21">
John&s;on, who, on the fir&s;r approaches of Mr. Smart's
malady, wrote &s;everal papers for a periodical publi|cation
in which that gentleman was concerned, to
&s;ecure his claim to a &s;hare in the profits of it. Mrs.
Smart al&s;o received from Dr. John&s;on &s;everal letters.
One of the&s;e, addre&s;&s;ed to her at Dublin, is &s;till pre|&s;erved;
and as every effu&s;ion from that celebrated
p$$n is now become intere&s;ting, it is here pre&s;emed to

<P>&startq;To enumerate the cau&s;es that have hindered me
from an&s;wering your letter would be of no u&s;e; be
a&s;&s;ured that di&s;re&s;pect had no part in the delay. I
have been always glad to he$r of you, and have not
neglected to enquire after you. I am not &s;urpri&s;ed to
hear that you are not much delighted with Ireland.
To one that has pa&s;&s;d &s;o many years in the plea&s;ures
and opulence of London, there are few places that
can give much delight; but we can never unite all
conveniences in any &s;phere; and mu&s;t only con&s;ider
which has the mo&s;t good in the whole, or more pro|perly
which has the lea&s;t evil. You have gone at the
wor&s;t time; the &s;plendor of Dublin is only to be &s;een
in a parliament winter; and even then matters will
be but little mended. I think, Madam, you may
look upon your expedition as a proper preparative to
the voyage which we have often talked of. Dublin,
though a place much wor&s;s than London, is: not &s;o
<PB N="xxii" REF="22">
bad as Iceland. You will now be hardened to all
from the &s;ight of poverty, and will be qualified to
lead us forward, when we &s;hrink at rueful &s;pectacles
of &s;moaky cottages and ragged inhabitants. One
advantage is always to be gained from the &s;ight of
poor countries; we learn lo know the comforts of our
own. I wi&s;h, however, it was in my power to make
Ireland plea&s;e you better; and whatever is in my
power you may always command. I &s;hall be glad to
hear from you the hi&s;tory of your management; whe|ther
you have a hou&s;e or a &s;hop, and what compa|nons
you have found; let me know every good and
every evil that be&s;alls you. I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t that you
don't u&s;e me as I have u&s;ed you, for we mu&s;t not
copy the faults of our friends: for my part I intend
to mend mine, and for the future to tell you more
frequently that I am, etc.</P>

<P>After an interval of little more than two years,
Mr. Smart appeared to be pretty well re&s;tored, and
was accordingly &s;et at liberty; but his mind had re|ceived
a &s;hook from which it never entirely recover|ed.
He took a plea&s;ant lodging in the neighbour|hood
of the Park; conducting his affairs for &s;ome
time with &s;ufficient prudence. He was maintained
partly by his literary occupations, and partly by the
genero&s;ity of his friends; receiving among other be|nefactions
fifty pounds a year from the Trea&s;ury; but
<PB N="xxiii" REF="23">
by who&s;e intere&s;t, as I do not certainly know, I will
not hazard a conjecture. Of the &s;tate of his mind,
and of his modes of life at this period &s;ome idea may
be formed by the following letter from Dr. Hawke&s;|worth
to Mrs. Hunter, one of his &s;i&s;ters.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>&startq;Dear Madam,&endq;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>&startq;I am afraid that you have before now &s;ecretly
accu&s;ed me, and I confe&s;s that appearances are again&s;t
me; I did not however delay to call upon Mr.
Smart, but I was unfortunate enough twice to mi&s;s him.
I was the third day of my being in town &s;eized with a
fever that was then epidemic, from which I am but
ju&s;t recovered. I have &s;ince my being in town this
&s;econd time called on my old friend, and &s;een him.
He received me with an ardour of kindne&s;s natural
to the &s;en&s;ibility of his temper, and we were &s;oon
&s;eated together by his fire &s;ide: I perceived upon his
table a quarto book, in which he had been writing, a
prayer book and a Horace: after the fir&s;t compli|ments,
I &s;aid I had been at Margate, had &s;een his
mother and his &s;i&s;ter, who expre&s;&s;ed great kindne&s;s
for him, and made me promi&s;e to come and &s;ee him;
to this he made no reply; nor did he make any en|quiry
after tho&s;e I mentioned; he did not even men|tion
the place, nor a&s;k me any que&s;tions about it, or
what carried me thither. After &s;ome pau&s;e, and &s;ome
indifferent chat, I returned to the &s;ubject, and &s;aid
that Mr. Hunter and you would be very glad to &s;ee
<PB N="xxiv" REF="24">
him in Kent: to this he replied very quick, &startq;I can|not
afford to be idle;&endq; I &s;aid he might employ his
mind as well in the country as in town, at which he
only &s;hook his head; and I intirely changed the &s;ubject.
Upon my a&s;king him when we &s;hould &s;ee the P&s;alms,
he &s;aid they were going to pre&s;s immediately: as to
his other undertakings, I found he had compleated
a tran&s;iation of Phoedrus in ver&s;e for Dod&s;ley at a
certain price, and that he is now bu&s;y in tran&s;lating
all Horace into ver&s;e, which he &s;ometimes thinks of
publi&s;hing; on his own account, and &s;ometimes of con|tra&s;ting
for it with 2 book&s;eller; I advi&s;ed him to
the latter, and he then told me he was in treaty about
it, and believed it would be a bargain: he told me
his principal motive for tran&s;lating Horace into ver&s;e,
was to &s;uper&s;ede the pro&s;e tran&s;lation which he did
for Newbery, which he &s;aid would hurt his memory.
He intends however to review that tran&s;lation, and
print it at the foot of the page in his poetical ver&s;ion,
which he propo&s;es to print in quarto with the Latin,
both in ver&s;e and pro&s;e, on the oppo&s;ite page; he
told me he once had thoughts of printing it by &s;ub&s;crip|tion,
but as he had troubled his friends already, he
was unwilling to do it again, and had been per&s;uaded
to publi&s;h it in numbers, which, though I rather di&s;|&s;uaded
him, &s;eemed at la&s;t to be the prevailing bent
of his mind: he read me &s;ome of it: it is very clo&s;e,
and his own poetical fire &s;parkles in it very fre|quently;
<PB N="xxv" REF="25">
yet, upon the whole, it will &s;carcely take
place of Francis's, and therefore, if it is not adopted'
as a &s;chool book, which perhaps may be the ca&s;e,
it will turn to little account. Upon mentioning his
pro&s;e tran&s;lation, I &s;aw his countenance kindle, and
matching up the book, &startq;what, &s;ays he, do you think
I had for this?&endq; I &s;aid I could not tell, &startq;why,
&s;ays he, with great indignation, thirteen pounds.&endq; I
expre&s;&s;ed very great a&s;toni&s;hment, which he &s;eemed
to think he &s;hould increa&s;e by adding, &startq;but, Sir, I
gave a receipt for a hundred&endq;; my a&s;toni&s;hment
however was now over, and I found that he received
only thirteen pounds becau&s;e the re&s;t had been ad|vanced
for his family; this was a tender point, and I
found means, immediately to divert him from it.</P>
<P>He is with very decent people, in a hou&s;e mo&s;t de|lighlfully
&s;ituated with a terras that overlooks. St.
James's Park, and a door into it. He was going to dine
with an old friend of my own, Mr. Richard Dalton,
who has an appointment in the King's library, and if
I had not been particularly engaged, I would have
dined with him. He had lately received a very gen|teel
letter from Dr. Lowth, and is by no means con|&s;idered
in any light that makes his company as a
gentleman, a &s;cholar, and a genius le&s;&s; de&s;irable. I
have been very particular, dear Madam, in relating
all the particulars of this conference, that you may
<PB N="xxvi" REF="26">
draw any inference, that I could draw from it, your|&s;elf.</P>
<P>&startq;I &s;hould incur my own cen&s;ure, which is le&s;s
tolerable than all others; if I did not expre&s;s my
&s;en&s;e of the civilities I received from you and Mr.
Hunter, while I was at Margate: I have Mrs.
Hawke&s;worth's expre&s;s reque&s;t in a letter now before
me to do the &s;ame on her part: if you, or any of the
family come into our part of the country, we &s;hall be
very glad to accommodate you with a table and a
bed; you will and a chearful fire &s;ide and a hearty
welcome. If in the mean time I can do you any
&s;ervice or plea&s;ura here, you will the more oblige as
you the more freely command me.</P>
<P>&startq;Our be&s;t compliments a tend you, Mr. Hunter,

<P>In the cour&s;e of a few years Mr. Smart's oeconomy
for&s;ook. him, and he was confined for debt in the
King's Bench Pri&s;on, the rules of which he afterwards
<PB N="xxvii" REF="27">
obtained by the kindne&s;s of his brother-in-law, Mr.
Thomas Carnan. He died after a &s;hort illne&s;s the
18th of May, 1770, of a di&s;order in his liver, leaving
behind him two daughters, who with his widow are
&s;ettled at Reading in Berk&s;hire, and by their prudent
management of a bu&s;ine&s;s, transferred to them by
the late Mr. John Newbery,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>The author of the&s;e pages gives his te&s;timony with pecu|liar plea&s;ure to the merits of a gentleman who&s;e friend&s;hip and civilities he experienced in early life; and who&s;e benefi|cence indeed to &s;ay nothing of his intellectual powers, &s;uf|fered no object within the &s;phere of its exertions, to be un|cheared by his kindne&s;s. The following epitaph, drawn up &s;ome years ago, but not publi&s;hed, will be a further evidence of the Author's opinion of Mr. Newbery's character. It is &s;up|po&s;ed to be written at the place where he was born and buried.</P>

<L>Rejoice,&mdash;</L>
<L>That, through Chri&s;t,</L>
<L>it is immortal!</L></NOTE> are in good cir|cum&s;tances.</P>
<P>His character, compounded like that of all human
beings, of good qualities and of defects, may ea&s;ily
be collected from this account of his life. A few of
his peculiarities remain to be mentioned.</P>
<P>Though he was a very diligent &s;tudent while at
Cambridge, he was al&s;o extremely fond of exrcie&s;e,
and of walking in particular; at which times it was
his cu&s;tom to pur&s;ae his meditations. A fullow &s;eu|dent
remembers a path worn by his con&s;tant treading
on the pavement under the Cloi&s;ters of his College.</P>
<P><PB N="xxviii" REF="28">
His piety was exemplary and fervent; it may not be
unintere&s;ting to the reader to be told, that Mr. Smart,
in compo&s;ing the religious poems, was frequently &s;o
impre&s;&s;ed with the &s;entiment of devotion, as to write
particular pa&s;&s;ages on his knees.</P>
<P>He was friendly, affectionate, and liberal to exce&s;s;
&s;o as often to give that to others, of which he was in
the utmo&s;t want him&s;elf; he was al&s;o particularly en|gaging
in conver&s;ation, when his fir&s;t &s;hyne&s;s was worn
away; which he had in common with literary men,
but in a very remarkable degree. Having under|taken</P>
<P><PB N="xxix" REF="29">
to introduce his wife to my Lord Darlington,
with whom he was well acquainted; he had no &s;ooner
mentioned her name to his Lord&s;hip, than he retreated
&s;uddenly, as if &s;tricken with a panic, from the room,
and from the hou&s;e, leaving her to follow overwhelmed
with confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>As an in&s;tance of the wit of his conver&s;ation, the
following extemporary &s;pondiac, de&s;criptive of the
three Bedels of the Univer&s;ity, who were at that time
all very fat men, is &s;till remembered by $is acade|mical
acquaintance.</P>
<P>Pinguia tergeminorum abdomina Bedellorum.</P>
<P>This line he afterwards in&s;erted in one of his
poems for the Tripos.</P>
<P>During the far greater part of his life he was
wholly inattentive to oeconomy; and by this negli|gence
lo&s;t fir&s;t his fortune and then his credit.
The civilities &s;hewn him by per&s;ons greatly his &s;u|periors
in rank and character, either induced him
to expect mines of wealth,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Modo non montes auri. TER.</NOTE> from the exertion of
his talents; or encouraged him to think him&s;elf ex|empted
from attention to common obligations. The
engagement into which he entered with Gardner
the book&s;eller, to furni&s;h papers monthly in conjunc|tion
with Mr. Rolt for the <HI>Univer&s;al Vi&s;itor,</HI> is a
memorable example of thoughtle&s;s imprudence. It
<PB N="xxx" REF="30">
was &s;ettled between the publi&s;her and the poets, that
the&s;e la&s;t &s;hould divide between them one third of the
profits of the work, and they engaged them&s;elves
moreover by a bond, not to write for ninety-nine
years to come in any other publication.</P>
<P>But his chief fault, from which mo&s;t of his other
faults proceeded, was his deviations from the rules of
&s;obriety; of which the early u&s;e of cordials in the
infirm &s;tate of his childhood and his youth, might per|haps
be one cau&s;e, and is the only extenuation.</P>
<P>Of the Odes of Smart it may be &s;aid in general,
that they are &s;pirited and poetical; it will be difficult
to find any other quality equally applicable to com|po&s;itions
very different from each other, and in many
of which oppo&s;ite characters occa&s;ionally predominate.
The Poet has followed the example of Horace, ra|ther
than that of the Grecian models, and of him he
is for the mo&s;t part <HI>doctus imitator;</HI> but in one or two
of the &s;erious poems he &s;urpri&s;es the reader with pa&s;|&s;ages
of a ludicrous ca&s;t, and deba&s;es by an impure
admixture, what otherwi&s;e would have been gold of
the &s;tandard value. The example of his model may
po&s;&s;ibly be pleaded as authority for this confu&s;ion of
&s;entiments; but be&s;ides that the blemi&s;hes of the ori|ginal
will be avoided by the judicious copyi&s;t, it may
fairly be que&s;tioned whether in any of the Odes
<PB N="xxx" REF="31">
of Horace which are confe&s;&s;edly grave, incontrover|tible
in&s;tances can be &s;hewn of low and colloquial
manners. In the page of the poet and the hi&s;torian
familiar cu&s;toms and dome&s;tic habits are rarely ex|hibited
with di&s;tinctne&s;s: in order to be under&s;tood,
they mu&s;t be &s;een; nor can we now with preci&s;ion
a&s;certain the limits between the coar&s;e and vulgar hu|mour
of ancient Rome, and that which was accounted
elegant and liberal. At any rate let us not ha&s;tily
impute a deviation from the principles of univer&s;al
ta&s;te to &s;o great a name as Horace.</P>
<P>I know not whether I &s;hall be patiently permitted
to reckon <HI>per&s;picuity</HI> among the excellencies of the
Odes of Smart; as the <HI>ob&s;cure</HI> has prevailed with
more modern and very celebrated poets, &s;anctioned
as it &s;hould &s;eem by the example of Pindar him&s;elf.
The lyre indeed of the immortal Theban may be
truly &s;aid to be <HI>vocal to the wi&s;e;</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></P>
<P>PINDAR OLYMP. 2.</P></NOTE> but its &s;trains were
al&s;o intelligible to inferior minds; for otherwi&s;e the
mixed multitudes, a&s;&s;embled at the Olympic and I&s;th|mian
games from every quarter of Greece, would not
have di&s;tingui&s;hed them with applau&s;e. Ob&s;curity,
or in other words a meaning &s;o conveyed as not to
be comprehended without painful exertion, cannot re|commend
any compo&s;ition; if it be true that we
write, as well as &s;peak, to be under&s;tood. The happy
<PB N="xxxii" REF="32">
few that can penetrate into my&s;teries, at which the un|initiated
can only wonder, will exult in their own &s;aga|city;
but they may chance to forget their author in
their admiration of them&s;elves. The meaning of Pin|dar,
as well as of Simonides, does not indeed always
appear upon the &s;urface; but the fragments of the latter
poet, &s;cattered through the works of the Greek hi&s;to|rians
and &s;cholia&s;ts, are too imperfect to make him a
pattern for imitation; and of Pindar many beauties,
once eminent and &s;plendid, lie buried under the ruins of
time. Allu&s;ions delicate and remote to eminent per|&s;ons
and di&s;tingoi&s;hed events, derive from their very
remotene&s;s their intere&s;t and beauty; but this is not
ob&s;curity; every cotemporary urder&s;tands them, who
is capable of ta&s;ting poetry. What however was
beautiful, mu&s;t quickly become unintelligible, without
any fault of its author, if the events to which it refers
be not recorded by the hi&s;torians who have descended
to after ages.</P>
<P>Even trifles become intere&s;ting and important,

We are gratified in finding by an in&s;cription in
Pau&s;anias, that Hiero, the favourite hero of Pindar,
was crowned thrice, like P&s;aumis of Camerina, in
the Olympic games; honours which his poet &s;eems
to pre&s;age in the conclu&s;ion of the Olympic Ode
in&s;cribed to him; and Homer, the mo&s;t intelligible
of poets, is not le&s;s engaging in his familiar nar|ratives;
<PB N="xxxiii" REF="33">
when he tells us, that the Oilean Ajax was
&s;horter in &s;tature than his brother, and that Uly&s;&s;es
was le&s;s dignified in his manner than Menelaus, till
he began to &s;peak.</P>
<P>As to the merit of particular Odes on our Author,
the fir&s;t, addre&s;&s;ed to <HI>Idlene&s;s,</HI> and the &s;econd, to <HI>Ethe|linda,</HI>
which was <HI>written,</HI> when he was only thirteen,
po&s;&s;e&s;s, the one the elegance of Sappho, and the other,
the &s;prightline&s;s of Anacreon; the Morning-Piece is
uniformly beautiful, and has long been admired for
its happy de&s;cription of labour; the Ode on St. Ce|cilia's
Day, inferior only to the great model by
Dryden, has none of the inequalities of his two pre|dece&s;&s;ors,
being uniformly dignified throughout; and
the Hymn to the Supreme Being, on his Recovery
from Sickne&s;s, is pious, animated, and pathetic.
The Ode on the fifth of December, being the Birth-Day
of a beautiful Young Lady, has been much ad|mired.
It was written on Mi&s;s Harriot Pratt, of
Downham in Norfolk, a lady for whom our Author
had entertained a long and un&s;ucce&s;sful pa&s;&s;ion; who
was the &s;ubiect al&s;o of the Crambo Ballad, and other
ver&s;es in&s;erted among the&s;e Poems. The Ode, of
which we are &s;peaking is indeed highly poetical; its
chief blemi&s;h is the too frequent and affected u&s;e of
alliteration.</P>
<P>The five Poems on the Divine Attributes are
<PB N="xxxiv" REF="34">
written with the &s;ublime&s;t energies of religion, and
the true enthu&s;ia&s;m of poetry; and had the pen of their
author &s;topped with, the&s;e compo&s;itions, they alone
would have given him a very di&s;tingui&s;hed rank
among the writers of ver&s;e. They are al&s;o more ac|curate
than the generality of his poems; which may
be attributed to the deference he might feel from
tho&s;e per&s;ons, who were to adjudge the prizes which
he obtained. That Mr. Seaton's donation has pro|duced
&s;o few poems of genuine merit has been a &s;ub|ject
of &s;urpri&s;e among tho&s;e, who accu&s;tomed only
to cur&s;ory contemplations on the human mind, ima|gine
that its operations may be generated by the
&s;ame methods, by which men produce improvements
in commerce, or effects in mechanics; that genius, to
appear, needs only to be invoked; and that in the
par&s;imony or kindne&s;s of patrons may be traced the
hi&s;tory of the ri&s;e and declen&s;ion of the arts.</P>
<P>To the foundation of Seaton, however we are
indebted for the poems of a <HI>Smart,</HI> a <HI>Glynn,</HI> and-a
<HI>Porteus;</HI> and if other compo&s;itions have been unno|ticed,
it has been <HI>le&s;s</HI> owing to their real inferiority,
than to the temper of mankind; who are too deeply
engaged with them&s;elves, to be&s;tow much time on the
exertions of others.</P>
<P>On the <HI>Hop Garden</HI> much commendation cannot
ju&s;tly be conferred; and the prai&s;e, which is withheld
<PB N="xxxv" REF="35">
from the poetry, will not be very chearfully lavi&s;hed
on the in&s;tructions. The Author &s;eems to have ad|dre&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf to the ta&s;k without previous informa|tion
on the art of which he treats. Poets are &s;eldom
acquainted with the detail of mechanical improve|ments;
but Hops were the production of his native
country, and therefore Hops mu&s;t be adorned by the
labours of the Mu&s;e. He&s;iod, and the Poet of Man|tua
had both probably turned up the glebe with their
own hands; but poetry was the only vehicle of in|&s;truction
in the age of the A&s;crean; who taught in &s;hort
precepts, ea&s;ily retained, like the Shepherd' of Ban|bury,
what is commonly better learnt by experience
and ob&s;ervation. But the refined &s;y&s;tem of modern
bards &s;oar far above the reach of tho&s;e for who&s;e u&s;e
we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e them intended; and we are well
contented that bread &s;hould be prepared, and a beve|rage
extracted from the apple by men who &s;eek not
wi&s;dom in the <HI>Georgia</HI> of Virgil, nor in the <HI>Cyder</HI>
of Phillips.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hilliard</HI> contains many &s;pirited lines; and
may afford entertainment to tho&s;e who care little about
the hero of the poem, or the &s;ubject of the quarrel.
Compo&s;itions of this cla&s;s, as they gratify malignity,
are u&s;ually read with great avidity on their fir&s;t ap|pearance;
but without uncommon merit they quickly
&s;ink into oblivion. Even the <HI>Dunciad</HI> is read per|haps
<PB N="xxxvi" REF="36">
with le&s;s delight than any other work of its cele|brated
author; nor &s;hould we re&s;ort at all to the
<HI>Temple of Dulne&s;s</HI> to contemplate the characters of
Curll or Theobald, could we not al&s;o fea&s;t on the
di&s;pute of the Virtuo&s;os before the throne of the Godde&s;s.</P>
<P>The <HI>Judgment of Midas</HI> is cla&s;&s;ical and elegant;
but Dramatic Pa&s;torals, even if the generally intere&s;t|ing
topic of love be &s;uperadded, will not greatly en|tertain,
without their proper embelli&s;hments, acting
and mu&s;ic. The <HI>Comus</HI> of Milton, with all its ex|cellance,
has been recommended entirely to general
reception by the aids of the &s;tage; and the <HI>Amyntas</HI>
of Ta&s;&s;o, with the exq$i&s;itely beautiful <HI>Pa&s;tor-Fido,</HI>
mu&s;t be habited in that ancient and characteri&s;tic dre&s;$,
if they return again to the admiration of the public.</P>
<P>Of the <HI>Fables</HI> and <HI>lighter Poems,</HI> the greater part
are either printed for the fir&s;t time, or collected by
the kind diligence of friends<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Among the&s;e a name that &s;hould be mentioned is that of Mr. I&s;aac Reed, the extent of who&s;e communications could be equalled only by the facility and kindne&s;s with which they were made.</NOTE> from books now &s;carcely
to be found; and from the&s;e, and the Fables in parti|cular,
we can promi&s;e our readers con&s;iderable enter-tainment.
Fable is indeed a &s;pecies of writing in-tere&s;ting
<PB N="xxxvii" REF="37">
to every rank of mankind, and to every age.
We love to be in&s;tructed while we are amu&s;ed; and
exerci&s;e our critical &s;agacity in applying the Dramatis
Per&s;onae of the narrative to our acquaintance or our
&s;elves, in exact proportion to our propen&s;ity for &s;atire,
or our de&s;ire of moral information. Rou&s;iean, from
a ju&s;t opinion that the former inclination predomi|nates,
in his famous Critique on the <HI>Fox and Crow</HI> of
La Fontaine, objects with his u&s;ual love of paradox
and his u&s;ual &s;pirit, to this cla&s;s of compo&s;itions;
but I believe he did not expect that his arguments
would prevail upon mothers to withhold from their
children the only writings that can induce them to
read. The fable in que&s;tion has certainly no merit of
the moral kind; but it delights us as a ju&s;t picture of
human life; it is a very ancient repre&s;entation of Folly
duped by Flattery; and was revived as early as the
time of Apuleius, and introduced by him into a &s;eri|ous
work with all the graces of novelty, and the
energy of invention.</P>
<P>Of the merit of the Fables before us &s;ome e&s;timate
may be made, by comparing the <HI>Pig</HI> of our Author
with the &s;ame &s;tory in Phaedius, of which it is a very
exact and beautiful tran&s;lation. If in any in&s;tances
the modern is &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by the mo&s;t charming fa|buli&s;t
of antiquity, for which perhaps the Roman is
not a little indebted to the &s;uperior force and conci&s;e|ne&s;s.
<PB N="xxxviii" REF="38">
of the language in which he wrote, in others the
original is undoubtedly rivalled, if not excelled; and
obtains at la&s;t a doubtful victory. The Poet unites
in the&s;e little compo&s;itions, the grace and ea&s;e of
Prior with the humour of Swift; and to the&s;e is &s;uper|added
a very con&s;iderable portion of poetical &s;pirit; a
quality in which many compo&s;itions-of this nature
are deficient, that have had the fortune to obtain con|&s;iderable reputation.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This is particularly the ca&s;e with re&s;pect to Gay's Fables, which are now almost wholly confined to the nur&s;ery and the &s;chool; &s;eldom recollected as poems but when forced on the memory as a ta&s;k; and &s;carcely more than a &s;ingle fable can be cited, among&s;t &s;o many favourite &s;tories, that is re|markable either for the beauty of its images, or the harmony of its numbers.</NOTE></P>
<P>I know not whether our Author, in his fable of <HI>the
Citizen and the Red Lion of Bren$ford,</HI> has not tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ed
the limits even of mythological probability.
On the productions of nature the fabuli&s;t has been
permitted to lavi&s;h the powers of &s;peech; and religi|ous &s;entiment among the ancients has co-operated
with him; for every oak had its dryad or hama|dryad;
every &s;tream and mountain its tutelary divi|nity,
and bea$ts &s;poke, if we will tru&s;t to Livy, long
after the days of <HI>Ae&s;op.</HI> But the works of art only
began to &s;hew them&s;elves, as the dominion of &s;uper|&s;tition
and ignorance di&s;appeared; and we cannot
<PB N="xxxix" REF="39">
help applying the <HI>incredulus odi</HI> of the poet to events
of which we have heard of no example.</P>
<P>Still however, the handmaid of nature may be
permitted to u&s;e &s;ome of the privileges of her mi&s;tre&s;s,
if the u&s;es them with caution and re&s;erve: we can li&s;|ten
with patience, perhaps with plea&s;ure, to the con|ver&s;ation
of <HI>the Bag-H'ig and the Tobacco-Pipe,</HI> if
the poet gives &s;pcech to his imaginary characters,
and &s;peech alone. Bat when art a&s;&s;umes the per&s;on
of nature; when the lion of the painter roars, and
&s;hakes his mane, and rea&s;ons like his archetype in the
fore&s;t; when imitation exerci&s;es functions, which it is
an indulgence to &s;uppo&s;e even in the original, the
mind rejects the fiction as improbable, and revolts
against it as ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>But after all it may favour too much of the rigour of
critici&s;m, to attempt to re&s;train by the &s;tricter rules of
art poems of who&s;e e&s;&s;ence it is to be anomalous and
excentric; ta&s;te and feeling mu&s;t at la&s;t decide the
que&s;tion; and the irregularity of the fable, intro|ducing
a dialogue between a man and a painted board,
may be forgiven for its humour.</P>
<P>Of the Latin Tran&s;lations, the fir&s;t in order as in
merit is that of <HI>Mr. Pope's Ode on St. Cecilia's
Day;</HI> and in reading the letter from him to our Au|thor,
where he &s;peaks of this performance, one cannot
help being offended at the par&s;imony of his prai&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="xl" REF="40">
The kinde&s;t apology that can be made for him is
that he had little relish for Latin poetry. Self-inte|re&s;t
however might have prompted him to more
liberal commendation of a tran&s;lator, who had enabled
his author to appear in the different countries of
Europe in attire at once elegant and appropriate. He
equals his original in the &s;ublime&s;t pa&s;&s;ages, if we ex|cept
only that one &s;o much admired by Dr. John&s;on;
and to the ballad and epigrammatic &s;tanzas gives dig|nity
and grace.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The author of the Review of Dr. Warton's E&s;&s;ay on the Writings and Genius of Pope, who is &s;aid to be Dr. John&s;on, ob&s;erves on the fir&s;t of the &s;tanzas alluded to, that though &startq;the two pa&s;&s;ions of merriment and exultation are undoubtedly different; as different as a gambol and a triumph, yet each is a &s;pecies of joy; and poetical mea&s;ures have not in any language been &s;o far refined, as to provide for the &s;ubdivi|&s;ions of pa&s;&s;ion.&endq; This is true; but it is al&s;o true, that there is a want of ta&s;te in applying any metre to &s;ubjects of dignity, which has been daba&s;ed by ludicrous and burle&s;que a&s;&s;ociations.</NOTE> The vulgar lines, which de&s;cribe
the power of Styx over the inthralled Euridice, and
the &s;uuerior power of mu&s;ic and of love, are tran&s;lated
with truth and beauty. In these inelegant deviations
from the majesty of the ode, the example of Dryden
occurred probably to his admirer; but they are faults
<PB N="xli" REF="41">
which no example can ju&s;tify. It has been objected,
and with &s;ome rea&s;on, to Smart's celebrated tran&s;la|tion,
that it exhibits a variety of metres, unauthorized
by any &s;ingle example among&s;t the Latin poets. But
had our author, too timid to pur&s;ue the rapid flights
and wild genius of his original, confined him&s;elf to
the regular recurrence of the Roman &s;tanza, his imi|tation
would not have been exact, and probably would
not have been intere&s;ting. Admiration is in works
of ta&s;te one &s;ource of our delight; and admiration is
felt in a con&s;iderable degree, when we find the poeti|cal
mea&s;ures of a dead, and of a living language ca|pable
of &s;o clo&s;e a likene&s;s. When two excellencies
cannot be united in the &s;ame effort of genius, to
choo&s;e between them is the province of di&s;cretion;
and the opinion of the public in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance
has fully ju&s;tified the choice of Smart.</P>
<P>The Tran&s;lation of Milton's <HI>L'Allegro,</HI> (the idea of
which our Author might have more happily expre&s;&s;ed
in Greek than by <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">) will probably be le&s;s
admired, as it his been done &s;ince with greater &s;uc|ce&s;s
by a cla&s;&s;ical Prelate: but I am not &s;ure that this
work is in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the public.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tripos-Poems,</HI> though written as college exer|ci&s;es
at an early age, are not wholly unworthy of this
collection; they &s;how con&s;iderable knowledge of the
Latin Tongue, at a time when the generality of &s;tu|dents
<PB N="xlii" REF="42">
are familiar only with its elements;<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The Latin Tran&s;lation of the Ballad, <HI>When Fanny Blooming Fair,</HI> was written at the age of &s;ixteen; and the Latin ver&s;es on <HI>Atrae</HI> at fourteen.</NOTE> they are
the work of a mind, attentive both to the &s;ub&s;tantial
parts and to the decorations of poetry.</P>
<P>To the labours of Smart on the <HI>E&s;&s;ay of Critici&s;m</HI>
tho&s;e per&s;ons chiefly are indebted, who being un|acquainted
with the Engli&s;h tongue, wi&s;h to &s;ee Mr.
Pope's ju&s;t rules of ta&s;te, embelli&s;hed indeed with his
powers of poetry, though appearing with le&s;s glo&s;s
and lu&s;tre through the medium of tran&s;lation. Smart
is a very diligent imitator of the epi&s;tolary &s;tyle of
Horace; and we &s;hall find him carefully following
the foot&s;teps of his ma&s;ter, where we might ofherwi&s;e
have been di&s;po&s;ed to &s;u&s;pect the purity of his lan|guage.
In the famous lines intended as an echo to
the &s;en&s;e, he has laboured through a very painful ta&s;k
with con&s;iderable dexterity; and in the beautiful pic|t$re
of the Reign of Leo, of Vida, and of the Arts,
on foreigner need regret that he is unacquainted with
Pope.</P>
<P>On the whole, if we con&s;ider that every &s;pecies of
Poetry, not even excepting the Epic, has been at|tempted
by our Author, and mo&s;t of them with emi|nent
&s;ucce&s;s, we &s;hall be inclined to admit that the
pre&s;ent collection is not excelled by many in the En|glish
<PB N="xiii" REF="43">
language; that the gay may extract amu&s;ement
from it, and the grave in&s;truction; or as all men par|take
at different &s;ea&s;ons of both the&s;e humours, that no
moments of lei&s;ure can occur to the admirer of poetry,
in which he will not be able in the&s;e volumes to gra|tify
his tafte.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Be&s;ides the works contained in this edition, our Author wrote a Poem called <HI>a Song to David,</HI> and a <HI>new Ver&s;ion of the P&s;alms:</HI> he al&s;o tran&s;lated the Works of Horace, and the Fabies of Phaedrus into Engli&s;h Metre; and ver&s;ified our Saviour's Parables. The&s;e, with two &s;mall pamphlets of Poems, were written after his confinement, and bear for the mo&s;t part melancholy proofs of the recent e&s;trangement of his mind. Such poems however have been &s;elected from his pamphlets, and in&s;erted in the pre&s;ent work, as were likely to be acceptable to the Reader.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author of the following piece has been told,
that the writing an Ode on S. Cecilia's Day, after Mr.
Dryden and Mr. Pope, would be great pre&s;umption,
which is the rea&s;on he detains the reader in this place
to make an apology, much again&s;t his will, he having
all due contempt for the impertinence of Prefaces.
In the fir&s;t place then, it will be a little hard (he
thinks) if he &s;hould be particularly mark'd out for
cen&s;ure, many others having written on the &s;ame &s;ub|ject
without any &s;uch imputations; but they (it may be)
did not live long enough to be laughed at, or, by &s;ome
lucky means or other, e&s;caped tho&s;e &s;hrewd remarks,
which, it &s;eems, are re&s;erved for him. In the &s;econd
place, this &s;ubject was not his choice, but impo&s;ed upon
him by a gentleman very eminent in the &s;cience of
Mu&s;ick, for whom he has a great friend&s;hip, and who
is, by his good &s;en&s;e and humanity, as much elevated
above the generality of mankind, as by his exqui&s;ite
art he is above mo&s;t of his profe&s;&s;ion. The reque&s;t
of a friend, undoubtedly, will be &s;neer'd at by &s;ome
as a &s;tale and antiquated apology: it is a very good
<PB REF="80">
one notwith&s;tanding, which is manife&s;t even from it's
tritene&s;s; for it can never be imagined, that &s;o many
excellent Authors, as well as bad ones, would have
made u&s;e of it, had they not been convinced of it's
cogency. As for the writer of this piece, he will re|joice
in being derided, not only for obliging his
friends, but any hone&s;t man what&s;oever, &s;o far as may
be in the power of a per&s;on of his mean abilities. He
does not pretend to equal the very wor&s;t parts of the
two celebrated performances already extant on the &s;ub|ject;
which acknowledgment alone will, with the
good-natured and judicious, acquit him of pre&s;ump|tion;
becau&s;e the&s;s pieces, however excellent upon the
whole, are not without their blemi&s;hes. There is in
them both an exact unity of de&s;ign, which though in
compo&s;itions of another nature a beauty, is an impro|priety
in the Pindaric, which &s;hould con&s;i&s;t in the ve|hemence
of &s;udden and unlook'd for tran&s;itions: hence
chiefly it derives that enthu&s;ia&s;tic fire and wildne&s;s,
which greatly di&s;tingui&s;h it from other &s;pecies of Poe&s;y.
In the fir&s;t &s;tanza of<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><L>Happy, Happy Happy pair,</L>

adapted to the maje&s;ty of an Ode, that it would make
no con&s;iderable figure in a ballad. And la&s;tly, they
both conclude with a turn which has &s;omething too
epigrammatical in it. Bating the&s;e trifles, they are in|comparably
beautiful and great; neither is there to be
found two more fini&s;hed pieces of Lyric Poetry in our
language, L'allegro and Il pen&s;ero&s;o of Milton ex|cepted,
which are the fine&s;t in any. Dryden's is

<HEAD>A
LETTER
TO A
FRIEND at the Univer&s;ity of CAMBRIDGE.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear *****,</OPENER>
<P>I AM now to acknowledge &s;everal letters, which I
lately received from you, without any return on my
part. As I have been very much hurried of late with
a multiplicity of affairs, I mu&s;t beg you will not only
be kind enough to overkook my pa&s;t omi&s;&s;ion, but to
indulge me for a little time longer. As &s;oon as I am
ma&s;ter of &s;ufficient lei&s;ure, I will give you my &s;enti|ments
without re&s;erve, concerning the affair, about
which you have thought proper to con&s;ult me; for the
pre&s;ent I de&s;ire you will con&s;ider this as a receipt for
your many favours, or a promi&s;&s;ory note to di&s;charge
my debt of friend&s;hip as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="186">
The de&s;ign and colouring of a poem, &s;uch as you
have planned, are not to be executed in a hurry, but
with &s;low and careful touches, which will give that
fini&s;hing to your piece, remarkable in every thing
that comes from your hand, and which I could wi&s;h
the precipitancy of my temper would permit me to
aim at upon all occa&s;ions. I long to &s;ee you take a
new flight to the regions of fame, not upon unequal
wings, that &s;ometimes ri&s;e to a degree of elevation,
and then fall again, but with an uniform tenour, like
the bird in VIRGIL,
<Q>&startq;Radit iter liquidum, celeres neque commovet alas.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>I have been now for about three weeks in this &s;cene
of &s;moke and du&s;t, and I think the republic of letters
&s;eems to be lamentably upon the decline in this me|tropolis.
Attornies clerks, and raw unexperienced
boys, are the chief critics we have at pre&s;ent. With
a &s;upercilious look and peremptory voice, which
they have caught from a few of their oracles, as dark
and ignorant as them&s;elves, the&s;e &s;triplings take upon
them to decide upon fable, character, language and
&s;entiment.</P>
<Q><L>&startq;Ne&s;cis, heu ne&s;cis dominae fa&s;tidia Romae;</L>
<L>Crede mil$i, nimium Martia turba &s;apit.&endq;</L></Q>
<P>With regard to writers, the town &s;warms with them,
and the aim of them all is pretty much the &s;ame, viz.
<PB N="159" REF="187">
to elevate and &s;urprize, as Mr. Bays &s;ays. At the head
of the&s;e &s;till continues the INSPECTOR. As we fre|quently
laughed together concerning this writer, when
you were la&s;t in town, I need not here give you a de|&s;cription
of his parts and genius. I remember you
expre&s;s'd great amazement at the reception his e&s;&s;ays
&s;eemed to meet with in all our coffee-hou&s;es; but you
mu&s;t con&s;ider that there are artifices to gain &s;ucce&s;s,
as well as merit to de&s;erve it. The former of the&s;e
his INSPECTORSHIP is eminently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, and
&s;ooner than fail, he will not he&s;itate, in order to make
him&s;elf talked of at any rate, to become mo&s;t glaringly
ridiculous. This an&s;wers the purpo&s;e of the book|&s;ellers,
as well perhaps as Attick wit, and hence it re|&s;ults
that they are willing to continue him in their pay.</P>
<P>In the packet, which I have &s;ent to you by the
&s;tage coach, you will find a paper called the IMPER|TINENT,
written by him&s;elf. In this curious piece he
has not &s;topped at abu&s;ing his own dear per&s;on, which
is the only &s;ubject he has not handled with his u&s;ual
malice, and the re&s;t of it is made a vehicle for invec|tive
again&s;t Mr. Fielding and me. It was u&s;hered
into the world in a pompous manner, as if intended to
be continued, but no &s;econd number was ever pub|li&s;hed,
and to &s;hew you a further in&s;tance of his fallacy,
he thence took occa&s;ion to triumph over a pretender
<PB N="160" REF="188">
to e&s;&s;ay-writing, which he would fain in&s;inuate, can|not
be executed by any one but him&s;elf.</P>
<P>This unfair dealing, &s;o unworthy a man, who a&s;|pires
to be a member of the &s;erene republic of letters,
induced me to wave for a time the de&s;ign you know
I was engaged in, in order to be&s;tow a few lines upon
this &s;cribbler, who in my eyes is a di&s;grace to literature.
In the fir&s;t heat of my poetic fury, I formed the idea
of another DUNCIAD, which I intended to call after
the mime of my hero, THE HILLIAD. The fir&s;t
book of it you will receive, among other things, by
the coach, and I &s;hall be glad to be favoured with
your opinion of it.</P>
<P>If it conduces to your entertainment, I &s;hall have
gained my end; for though I have received &s;uch pro|vocation
from this man, I believe I &s;hall never carry
it any further. I really find &s;ome involuntary &s;en&s;a|tions
of compa&s;&s;ion for him, and I cannot help think|ing,
that, if he could keep within the bounds of de|cency
and good manners, he would be a rare in&s;tance
of what may be done by a fluency of periods, without
genius, &s;en&s;e, or meaning. Though I am per&s;uaded
he is quite incorrigible, I am &s;till reluctant to publi&s;h
that piece, for I would rather be commended to po&s;|terity
by the elegant and amiable mu&s;es, than by the
&s;atyric &s;i&s;ter, politely called by an eminent author,
<HI>the lea&s;t engaging of the Nine.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="189">
On this account I &s;hall proceed no further 'till you
have favoured me with your opinion, by which I will
ab&s;olutely determine my&s;elf. I hope therefore you
will peru&s;e it as &s;oon as you can with convenience,
and return it to me by the &s;tage. You may &s;hew it
to Jack ******, and to Mr. ****.</P>

Dear *****,

</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<OPENER>DEAR SMART,</OPENER>
<P>THE peru&s;al of your poem has given me &s;o much
plea&s;ure, that I cannot po&s;tpone thanking you for it,
by the fir&s;t opportunity that has offered. I have read
it to the per&s;ons you de&s;ired I &s;hould, and they ap|prove
the de&s;ign in the highe&s;t manner. I cannot
conceive what &s;hould make you he&s;itate a moment
about the publication, and to be free with you, you
<PB N="162" REF="190">
mu&s;t not by any means &s;uppre&s;s it. When I &s;ay this,
I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee you bet|ter
employed, than in the di&s;&s;ection of an in&s;ect; but
&s;ince the work &s;hould be done by &s;ome body, and
&s;ince you have made &s;uch a progre&s;s, I mu&s;t take
the liberty to in&s;i&s;t, that you will not drop this un|dertaking.</P>
<P>To &s;peak in plain terms; I look upon it to be in|di&s;pen&s;ably
incumbent on you to bring the mi&s;creant
to poetic ju&s;tice; it is what you owe to the cau&s;e of
learning in general, to your Alma Mater, this Uni|ver&s;ity,
and, let me add, it is what you owe to your|&s;elf.
The world will ab&s;olve you from any imputa|tion
of ill-nature, when it is con&s;idered that the pen
is drawn in defence of your own character. Give me
leave upon this occa&s;ion&punc; to quote a pa&s;&s;age from the
SPECTATOR, which I think pertinent to the pre&s;ent
&s;ubject. &startq;Every hone&s;t man ought to look upon
him&s;elf as in a natural &s;tate of war with the libeller
and lampooner, and to annoy them, wherever
they fall in his way. This is but retaliating upon
them, and treating them as they treat others.&endq;</P>
<P>Thus thought the polite Mr. Addi&s;on in a ca&s;e
where he was not immediately concerned; and can
you doubt what to do, when per&s;onally attacked? As
&s;oon as the hi&s;&s;ing of the &s;nake is heard, &s;ome means
<PB N="163" REF="191">
&s;hould be devi&s;ed to cru&s;h him. The advice of VIR|GIL
is,&mdash;&startq;Cape &s;axa manu, cape robora pa&s;tor.&endq;</P>
<P>I can tell you that your friends here expect this of
you, and we are all unanimous in thinking, that a
man who has the honour of belonging to this learned
Univer&s;ity, and to whom the prize, for di&s;playing
with a ma&s;terly hand the attributes of his Maker, has
been adjudged for three years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, &s;hould not,
on any account, &s;uffer him&s;elf to be trifled with,
by &s;o frigid and empty a writer. I would have
you reflect that you launched into the world with
many circum&s;tances, that rai&s;ed a general expectation
of you, and the early approbation of &s;uch a genius as
Mr. POPE, for your elegant ver&s;ion of his ode, made
you con&s;idered as one, who might hereafter make a
figure in the literary world; and let me recommend
to you, not to let the laurel, yet green upon your
brow, be torn off by the prophane hands of an unhal|lowed
hireling. This, I think, as is ob&s;erved already,
you owe to your&s;elf, and to that Univer&s;ity which has
di&s;tingui&s;hed you with honour.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the motives of retaliation, which I have
urged for the publication of your poem, I cannot help
con&s;idering this matter in a moral light, and I mu&s;t
avow, that in my eyes it appears an action of very
great merit. If to pull off the ma&s;k from an im|po&s;tor,
<PB N="164" REF="192">
and detect him in his native colours to the
view of a long-deluded public, may be looked upon
as a &s;ervice to mankind (as it certainly is) a better
opportunity never can offer it&s;elf.</P>
<P>In my opinion the cau&s;e of literature is in imminent
danger of a total degeneracy, &s;hould this writer's
diurnal productions meet with further encouragement.
Without &s;training hard for it, I can perceive a cor|ruption
of ta&s;te diffu&s;ing it&s;elf, throughout the cities
of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter. For a clear vein of
thinking, ea&s;y natural expre&s;&s;ion, and an intelligible
&s;tile, this pretender has &s;ub&s;tituted bri&s;k que&s;tion and
an&s;wer, pert, unmeaning periods, ungrammatical con|&s;truction,
unnatural metaphors, with a profu&s;ion of
epithets, incon&s;i&s;tent for the mo&s;t part with the real
or figurative meaning of his words, and in &s;nort, all
the ma&s;culine beauties of &s;tile, are likely to be ba|ni&s;hed
from among us by the continuation of his pa|pers
for almo&s;t two years together.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, I &s;ubmit it to you, whether this may
not lead on to a total depravity of &s;en&s;e and ta&s;te.
Should the more &s;ober at our coffee-hou&s;es be daz|zzled
with fal&s;e embelli&s;hments; &s;hould boys ad|mire
this unnatural flouri&s;hing, I do not in the lea&s;t
que&s;tion, but the ri&s;ing generation will be totally in|fected
with this &s;trange motley &s;tile, and thus anti|the&s;is
<PB N="165" REF="193">
and point will be the prevailing turn of the
nation.</P>
<P>It is to prevent a contagion of this &s;ort, that HO|RACE
took the pen in hand; for this Quintilian fa|voured
the world with his excellent work. The in|genious
authors of France have always attended to
this point. Truth, they in&s;i&s;ted, is the very founda|tion
of fine writing, and that no thought can be
beautiful, which is not ju&s;t, was their con&s;tant le&s;&s;on.
To enforce this and pre&s;erve a manly way of think|ing
BOILEAU la&s;hed the &s;cribblers of his time, and
in our own country the Spectators, Tatlers, and Guar|dians
have laboured for this end. To this we owe
the Bathos, in which we find expo&s;ed, with the mo&s;t
delicate traits of &s;atire, all fal&s;e figures in writing;
and finally to this we owe the Dunciad of Mr. POPE.</P>
<P>The&s;e in&s;tances, dear Smart, are &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify
your proceeding, and let me tell you, that a cultiva|tion
of ta&s;te is a point of more moment than perhaps
may appear at fir&s;t &s;ight. In the cour&s;e of my read|ing
I have ob&s;erved that a corruption in morals has
always attended a decline of letters. Of this Mr.
POPE &s;eems to be &s;en&s;ible, and, hence we find in the
conclu&s;ion of his Dunciad, the general progre&s;s of
dulne&s;s over the land is the final coup de grace to
every thing decent, every thing laudable, elegant
and polite.</P>
<Q><PB N="166" REF="194">
<L>Religion blu&s;hing veils her &s;acred fire$,</L>
<L>And unawares morality expires.</L>
<L>Nor public fame, nor private dares to &s;hine,</L>
<L>Nor human &s;park is left, nor glymp&s;e divine.</L>
<L>Lo! thy dread empire, CHAOS! is re&s;tor'd.</L>
<L>Light dies before thy uncreating word.</L>
<L>Thy hand great ANARCH lets the curtain fall,</L>
<L>And univer&s;al darkne&s;s buries all.</L></Q>
<P>I am aware that you may an&s;wer to what has been
promi&s;ed, that the man is not of con&s;equence enough
for all this, and you may ob&s;erve to me, that at fir&s;t
&s;itting out, I my&s;elf called him by the figurative and
typical appellation of an iu&s;ect. But if an infect gets
into the &s;un&s;hine, and there blazes, &s;hines and buzzes
to the annoyance of tho&s;e, who may be ba&s;king in the
beams, it is time for the mu&s;es wing to bru&s;h the
thing away. In plain Engli&s;h, the rapidity, with
which this writer went on in his progre&s;s, was &s;o
a&s;toni&s;hing, that I really looked upon him to be re|&s;erved
for the great in&s;trument of dullne&s;s in the com|pletion
of her work, which certainly mu&s;t be accom|pli&s;hed,
unle&s;s a &s;peedy &s;top be put to that inundation
of non&s;en&s;e and immorality with which he has over|whelmed
the nation.</P>
<P>I have mentioned immorality, nor will I retract the
word. Has he not attacked, maliciou&s;ly attacked the
reputations of many gentlemen, to whom the world
has been greatly obliged?&mdash;He did not brandi&s;h his
<PB N="167" REF="195">
goo&s;e-quill for any length of time, before he di&s;|charged
a torrent of abu&s;e upon the reverend Mr.
Francis, who&s;e amiable character, and valuable tran&s;|lation
of HORACE, have endeared him both to tho&s;e,
who are, and tho&s;e who are not acquainted with him.
Even beauty and innocence were no &s;afe-guards again&s;t
his calumny, and the &s;oft-eyed virgin was by him
cruelly obliged to &s;hed the tender tear.</P>
<P>Upon the commencement of the Covent-Garden
Journal, Mr. Fielding declared an humorous war
again&s;t this writer, which was intended to be carried
with an amicable plea&s;antry, in order to contribute to
the entertainment of the town. It is recent in every
bodies memory, how the INSPECTOR behaved upon that
occa&s;ion. Con&s;cious that there was not an atom of
humour in his compo&s;ition, he had recour&s;e to his u&s;ual
&s;hifts, and in&s;tantly di&s;clo&s;ed a private conver&s;ation;
by which he reduced him&s;elf to the alternative men|tioned
by Mr. POPE; &startq;and if he lies not, mu&s;t at
lea&s;t betray.&endq; Through all Mr. Fielding's ini|mitable
comic Romances, we perceive no &s;uch thing
as per&s;onal malice, no private character dragged into
light; but every &s;troke is copied from the volume
which nature has unfolded to him; every &s;cene of life
is by him repre&s;ented in its natural colours, and every
&s;pecies of folly or humour is ridiculed with the mo&s;t
exqui&s;ite touches. A genius like this is perhaps more
<PB N="168" REF="196">
u&s;eful to mankind, than any cla&s;s of writers; he &s;erves
to di&s;pel all gloom from our minds, to work off our
ill-humours by the gay &s;en&s;ations excited by a well
directed plea&s;antry, and in a vein of mirth he leads
his readers into the knowledge of human nature; the
mo&s;t u&s;eful and plea&s;ing &s;cience we can apply to. And
yet &s;o de&s;erving an author has been mo&s;t, gro&s;sly treat|ed
by this wild E&s;&s;ayi&s;t, and, not to multiply in&s;tances,
has he not attempted to rai&s;e tumults and divi&s;ions in
our theatres, contrary to all decency and common
&s;en&s;e, and contrary to the practice of all polite writers,
who&s;e chief aim has ever been to cheri&s;h harmony
and good manners, and to diffu&s;e through all ranks
of people a ju&s;t refinement of ta&s;te in all our public
entertainments?</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations, dear Sir, prompt you to the
blow, and will ju&s;tify it when given. I believe, I
may venture to add, never had poet &s;o inviting a &s;ub|ject
for &s;atire; POPE him&s;elf had not &s;o good an hero
for his DUNCIAD. The fir&s;t Worthy who &s;at in that
throne, viz. Lewis Theobald of dull memory, em|ployed
him&s;elf in matters of &s;ome utility, and, upon
being dethroned, the per&s;on, who &s;ucceeded, was one,
who formerly had &s;ome &s;cattered rays of light; and
in mo&s;t of his comedies, though whim&s;ical and extra|vagant,
there are many &s;trokes of drollery; not to

But in the Hero of the Hilliad all the requi&s;ites
&s;eem to be united, without one &s;ingle exception. You
remember, no doubt, that in the di&s;&s;ertation prefixed
to the Dunciad the efficient qualities of an hero for
the little epic are mentioned to be vanity, impudence
and debauchery. The&s;e accompli&s;hments, I appre|hend,
are glaring in the per&s;on you have fixed upon.
As a &s;ingle and notable in&s;tance of the two fir&s;t, has
he not upon all occa&s;ions joined him&s;elf to &s;ome cele|brated
name, &s;uch as the Right Honourable the Earl
of Orrery, or &s;ome other &s;uch exalted character? I
have frequently diverted my&s;elf by comparing this
proceeding to the cruelty of a tyrant, who u&s;ed to tie
a living per&s;on to a dead carca&s;s; and as to your hero's
debauchery, there are, I am told, many plea&s;ant in|&s;tances
of it.</P>
<P>Add to the&s;e &s;everal &s;ubordinate qualifications;
&s;uch as foppery, a &s;urprizing alacrity to get into
&s;crapes, with a notable facility of extricating him&s;elf,
an amazing turn for politicks, a wonderful knowledge
of herbs, minerals and plants, and to crown all, a
comfortable &s;hare of gentle dulne&s;s. This gentle
dulne&s;s is not that impenetrable &s;tupidity, which is
remarkable in &s;ome men, but it is known by that
countenance, which Dr. Garth calls, &startq;demurely
meek, in&s;ipidly &s;erene.&endq; It is known by a bri&s;k vo|lubility
of &s;peech, a lively manner of &s;aying nothing

<L>THOU God of je&s;t, who o'er th' ambrosial bowl,</L>
<L>Giv'&s;t joy to Jove, while laughter &s;hakes the pole;</L>
<L>And thou, fair Ju&s;tice, of immortal line,</L>
<L>Hear, and a&s;&s;i&s;t the poet's grand de&s;ign,</L>
</LG>
<P><NOTE TYPE="foot"><P><HI>Thou God of je&s;t.</HI> As the de&s;ign of heroic poetry is to celebrate the virtues and noble achievements of truly great per&s;onages, and conduct them through a &s;eries of hard&s;hips to the comple|tion of their wi&s;hes, &s;o the little epic delights in repre&s;ent|ing, with an ironical drollery, the mock qualities of tho&s;e, who, for the benefit of the laughing part of mankind, are plea&s;ed to become egregiou&s;ly ridiculous, in an affected imitation of the truly renown'd worthies above-mentioned. Hence ou$ poet calls upon Momus, at the fir&s;t opening of his poem, to convert his hero into a je&s;t. So that in the pre&s;ect ca&s;e, it can|not be &s;aid, <HI>facit indignatio ver&s;um,</HI> but, iv I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>facit $$$ilatio ver&s;um;</HI> which may &s;erve to &s;hew our author's temper of mind is free from rancour, or ill-nature. Notwith &s;tanding the great incentives he has had to prompt him to this undertaking, he is not actuated by the &s;pirit of re|venge; and to check the $allies of fancy and humourous inven|tion, he further invokes the godde&s;s Themis, to admini&s;ter &s;trict, poetic ju&s;tice.</P>
<P><HI>Shakes the pole.</HI>] Several cavils have been rai&s;ed again&s;t this pa&s;&s;age. QUINRUS FLESTRIN, the unborn poet, is of opinion that it is brought in merely to eke out a ver&s;e; but though in many points I am inclined to look upon this critick as irrefra|gable, I mu&s;t beg leave at pre&s;ent to appeal from his verdict; and, tho' Horace lays it down as rule not to admire any thing, I cannot help enjoying &s;o plea&s;ing an operation of the mind upon this occa&s;ion. We are here pre&s;ented with a grand idea, no le&s;s than Jupiter &s;haking his &s;ides and the heavens at the &s;ame time. The Pagan thunderer has often been &s;aid to agitate the pole with a nod, which in my mind gives too awful an image, whereas the one in que&s;tion conveys an idea of him in good humour, and confirms what Mr. Orator Henley &s;ays in his excellent tracts, that &startq;the deity is a joyous being.&endq;</P>

<P><HI>Grafts the bays,</HI>] Much puzzle hath been occa&s;ioned among the naturali&s;ts concerning the engraftment here mentioned. HILL's natural hi&s;tory of trees and plants, vol. 52, page 336 &s;aith, it has been frequently attempted, but that the tree of dulne&s;s will not admit any &s;uch inoculation. He adds in page 339, that he him&s;elf tried the experiment for two years &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively, but that the twig of laurel, like a feather in the &s;tate of electricity, drooped and died the moment he touched it. Not|with&s;tanding this authority, it is well known that this opera|tion has been performed by &s;ome choice &s;pirits. ERASMUS in his encomium on Folly &s;hews how it may be accompli&s;hed; in our own times POPE and GARTH found means to do the &s;ame: and in the &s;equel of this work, we make no doubt but the &s;tem here-mentioned will bear &s;ome luxuriant branches, like the tree in VIRGIL,
<Q><L>Nec longum tempus, et ingens</L>
<L>Exait ad Caelum ramis felicibus arbos,</L>
<L>Miraturque novas frondes et non &s;ua Poma.</L></Q></P>

<P><HI>Poet,</HI>] QUINBUS FLESTRIN &s;aith, with his u&s;ual impor|tance, that this is the only piece of ju&s;tice done to our hero in this work. To this a&s;&s;ents the widow at Cuper's who it &s;eems is not a little proud of the &startq;words by Dr. Hill, and the mu|&s;ick by Lewis Granon, E&s;q;&endq; This opinion is further con|firmed by Major England, who admires the pretty turns on Kitty, and Kate, and Catherine and Katy, but from the&s;e ve|nerable authorities, judicious Reader, you may boldly di&s;&s;ent, <HI>meo periculo.</HI></P>
<P>MART. MAC.</P>
<P><HI>Puffer,</HI>] of this talent take a &s;pecimen. In a letter to him|&s;elf he &s;aith; &startq;you have di&s;covered many of the beauties of the ancients; they are obliged to you; we are obliged to you; were they alive they would thank you; we who are alive do thank you.&endq; His con&s;tant cu&s;tom of running on in this manner, occa&s;ioned the following epigram,
<Q><L>Hill puffs him&s;elf, forbear to chide;</L>
<L>An in&s;ect vile and mean.</L>
<L>Ma&s;t fir&s;t, he knows, be magnify'd</L>
<L>Before it can be &s;een.</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>'Pothecary, Play'r.</HI>] For both the&s;e vide WOODWARD's-letter,
Pa&s;&s;im.</P>
<P><HI>Like the huge earth.</HI>] The allu&s;ion here &s;eems to be taken from OVID, who de&s;cribes the earth fixed in the air, by its own &s;tupidity, or <HI>vis inertiae:</HI>&mdash;
<Q><L>Pendebat in aere tellu&s;</L>
<L>Ponderitus librata &s;uis.&mdash;</L></Q>
But, reader, dilate. your imagination to take in the much greater idea our poet here pre&s;ents to you. con&s;ider the immen&s;e in|anity of &s;pace, and then the comparative nothingne&s;s of the globe, and you may attain an adequate conception of our hero's reputation&punc; and the mighty b$&s;is it &s;tands upon. It is worth ob|&s;erving here that our author&punc; <HI>qua&s;i aliud agens,</HI> di&s;plays at one touch of his pen more knowledge of the planetary &s;y&s;tem, than is to be found in all the volumes of the mathematicians.</P>
<P>This note is pa$tly by Macularius, and partly by Mr. Jinkyns, fhilomath.</P>
<P><HI>Say, Mu&s;e,</HI>] Ob&s;erve, gentle reader, how tenderly our author treats his hero throughout his whole poem; he does not here impute his ridiculous conduct, and all that train of errors which have attended his con&s;ummate vanity, to his own perver&s;e in|clination, but with greater candour in&s;inuates that &s;ome Daemon, &s;oe to Hillario's repo&s;e, fir&s;t mi&s;led his youthful imagination; which is a kind of apology for his life and character. He is not the only one who has been &s;educed to his ruin in this man|ner. We read it in POPE,
<Q>Some Daemon whi&s;per'd, Vi&s;to have a lade.</Q></P>
<P>Hence then ari&s;e our hero's misfortunes; and that the Daemon above-mentioned was a $oe to truth, will appear from Hilliario's notable talent at misrepre&s;enting circum&s;tances, for which vide all the INSPECTORS.</P>
<P><HI>May that day appear,</HI>] This &s;eems to be wrote with an eye to a beautiful pa&s;&s;age in a very elegant poem;
<Q><L>Ye Gods annihilate both &s;pace and time,</L>
<L>And make two lovers happy.&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>The reque&s;t is extremely mode&s;t, and I really wonder it was never complied with; but it mu&s;t be &s;aid in favour of Mr. Smart, that he is &s;till more rea&s;onable in his demand, and it appears by the alteration in the &s;tile, that his &s;cheme may be reduced to practice though the other is mighty fine in theory. The INSPECTOR is of this opinion, and &s;o is Mon&s;ieur de Scaizau.</P>
<P><HI>A tatter'd tap$&s;try</HI>] Our Author has been extremely negligent upon this occa&s;ion, and has indolently omitted an opportunity of di&s;playing his talent for poetick imagery. HOMER has de&s;cribed ihe &s;hield of Achilles with all the art of his imagi|nation; VIRGIL has followed him in this point, and indeed both he and OVID, &s;eem to be delighted when they have ei|ther a picture to de&s;cribe, or &s;ome representation in the labours of the loom. Hence ari&s;es a double delight; we admire the work of the artificer, and the poet's account of it; and this plea&s;ure Mr. Smart might have impre&s;&s;ed upon his readers in this pa&s;&s;age, as many things were wrought into the tape&s;try here-mentioned. In one part our hero was admini&s;tering to a patient, &startq;and the fre&s;h vomit runs for ever green.&endq; The theatre at May-fair made a con&s;picuous figure in the piece&mdash;the pit &s;eemed to ri&s;e in an uproar&mdash;the gallery opened its rude throats&mdash;and apples, oranges and halfpence flew about our hero's ears.&mdash;The mall in St. James's Park was di&s;played in a beautiful Vi&s;ta, and you might perceive Hillario with his janty air waddling along.&mdash;In Mary le Bone fields, he was dancing round a glow worm, and finally the Rotunda at Ranelagh filled the eye with its magnificence, and in a corner of it &s;tood a hand&s;ome young fellow holding a per&s;onage, dre&s;&s;ed in blue &s;$$k, by the ear; &startq;the very wor&s;ted &s;till looked black and blue.&endq; There were many other curious figures, but out of a &s;hameful lazine&s;s has our poet omitted them.</P>
<P>POLYMBTIS CANTABRIGIENSIS.</P>
<P><HI>Th' a&s;toni&s;h'd hair:</HI>] This pa&s;&s;age &s;eems to be an imitation of the Sybil in the &s;ixth book of VIRGIL;
<Q><L>Subito non wiltus, non color unus</L>
<L>Nec comtae man&s;ere c$mae.&mdash;</L></Q>
and is admirably expre&s;&s;ive of the witch's prophetic fury, and u&s;hers in the prediction of Hillario's fortune with proper &s;o|lemnity.&mdash;</P>
<P>This note is by one of the Aeoli&s;ts, mentioned with honour in the Tale of a Tub.</P>
<P><HI>Be th'</HI> INSPECTOR, <HI>&amp;c</HI>] When the Di&s;temper fir&s;t raged among the horned cattle, the king and council ordered a cer|tain officer to &s;uper-intend the bea&s;ts, and to direct that &s;uch, as were found to be infected, &s;hould be knocked in the head.</P>
<P>This officer was called the INSPECTOR, and from thence I would venture to lay a wager, our hero derived his title.</P>
<P>BENTLEY, Junior.</P>
<P><HI>Beware of Iri&s;hman, &amp;c.</HI>] It extremely probable that our poet is intimately acquainted with the cla&s;&s;ics; he &s;eems fre|quently to have them in his eye, and &s;uch an air of enthu&s;ia&s;m runs through his whole &s;peech, that the learned reader may ea&s;ily perceive he has taken fire at &s;ome of the prophecies in HOMER and VIRGIL.&mdash;The whole is delivered in breaks, and unconnected tran&s;itions, which denote vehement emotions in the mind; and the hint here concerning the Iri&s;h is perfectly in the manner of all great epic poets, who generally give the reader &s;ome idea of what is to en&s;ue, without unfolding the whole. Thus we fi$d in VIRGIL,
<Q><L>$ella, horrida bella,</L>
<L>Et Tybrim multo &s;pumantem &s;anguine cerno.</L></Q>
and again,
<Q>Alius Lati. jam partus Achilles.</Q>
And in The &s;equel of this work, I believe, it will be found, that as Aeneas had another Achilles, &s;o our hero has had as formidable an adver&s;ary.</P>
<P><HI>Farewel, a long farewel,</HI>] The ingenious Mr. L&mdash;der &s;ays that the following pa&s;&s;age is taken from a work, which he intends &s;hortly to publi&s;h by &s;ub&s;cription, and he has now in the pre&s;s a pamphlet, called &startq;Mr. Smart's U&s;e and Abu&s;e of the Mo|derns.&endq; But, with his leave, this pa&s;&s;age is partly imitated from Cardinal Wol&s;ey's &s;peech, and from Othello.</P>
<P><HI>Neutral non&s;en&s;e, &amp;c.</HI> The train, here de&s;cribed, is worthy of Hillahrio, pertne&s;s, dulne&s;s, &s;candal and malice, &amp;c, being the very con&s;tituents of an hero for the mock heroic, and it is not without propriety that non&s;en&s;e is introduced with the epithet, neutral; non&s;en&s;e being like a Dutchman, not only in an un|meaning &s;tupidity, but in the art of pre&s;erving a &s;trict neu|trality. This neutrality may be aptly explained by the fol|lowing epigram,
<Q><L>Word-valiant wight, thou great he &s;hrew,</L>
<L>That wrangles to no end;</L>
<L>Since non&s;en&s;e is nor fal&s;e nor true,</L>
<L>Thou'rt no man's foe or friend&punc;</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Fal&s;hood,</HI>] Th$s lady is de&s;cribed with two books in her hand, but our author chu&s;ing to pre&s;erve a neutrality, though not a non&s;en&s;ical one, upon this occa&s;ion, the tories are at li|berty to fill up this blank with Rapin, Burnet, or any names that will-&s;it the niches; and the whigs may, if they plea&s;e, in|&s;ert Ec$ard Higgons, &amp;c. But why, exclaimeth a certain critic, &s;hould fal&s;hood be given to Hillario?&mdash;Becau&s;e, replieth Macularius, he has given many &s;pecimens of his talent that way. OUT hero took it into his he-id &s;ome time &s;ince to tell the world that he caned a gentleman, whom he called by the name of Mario; what degree of faith the town gave him upon that occa&s;ion, may be collected from the two following lines, by a certain wag who &s;hall be namele&s;s.
<Q><L>To beat one man great Hill was fated;</L>
<L>What man?&mdash;a man that he created.</L></Q>
The following epig$am may be al&s;o properly in&s;erted here.</P>
<Q><L>What H&mdash;ll one day &s;ays, he the next does deny,</L>
<L>And candidly tells us&mdash;'tis all a damn'd lye:</L>
<L>Dear Doctor&mdash;this candour from you is not wanted;</L>
<L>For why &s;hou'd you own it? 'tis taken for granted.</L></Q>
<P><HI>Crawls Flatt'ry, &amp;c.</HI>] Our hero is as remarkable for his en|comiums, where it is his intere&s;t to commend, as for his abu&s;e, where he has taken a di&s;like m&s;like; but from the latter he is ca&s;ily to be bought off, as may be &s;een in the following excellent epigram.
<Q><L>An author's writings oft reveal,</L>
<L>where now and then he takes a meal.</L>
<L>Invite him once a week to dinner,</L>
<L>He'll &s;aint you, tho' the vile&s;t &s;inner.</L>

<L>He gives you &s;oul, expre&s;&s;ion, grace.</L>
<L>Swears what you will, un&s;wears it too;</L>
<L>What will not beef and pudding do?</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Without a mu&s;e, &amp;c.</HI>] No the devil a bit!&mdash;I am the only per&s;on that can do that!&mdash;My poems, written at fifteen, were done without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any mu&s;e, and better than all Smart's poetry.&mdash;The Mu&s;es are &s;trumpets&mdash;they frequently give an intellectual <HI>gonorrhaea</HI>&mdash;Court debt not paid&mdash;I'll never be poet laureate.&mdash;Coup de grace unan&s;werable&mdash;Our foes &s;hall knuckle&mdash;five pounds to any bi&s;hop that will equal this&mdash;<HI>Gum guiacum</HI> for <HI>Latin lignum vitae.</HI>&mdash;Adam the fir&s;t Dutchman&mdash;victorious &s;troke for Old England&mdash;Tweedle-dum and Twee|dle-dee.</P>
<P>Oratory-Right-Rea&s;on-Chapel, Saturday
13th of January, and old &s;tile for ever.</P>
<P><HI>Jargon grav'd, &amp;c.</HI>] JARGON is here properly introduced graving our hero's titles, which are admirably brought into ver&s;e&punc; but the gentleman who wrote the la&s;t note, Mr. Orator H&mdash;ley, takes umbrage at this pa&s;&s;age, and exclaimeth to the following effect. &startq;Jargon is meant for me.&endq; There is more mu&s;ic in a peal of marrowbones and cleavers than in the&s;e ver&s;es.&mdash;I am a logician upon fundamentals.&mdash;Arationali&s;t,&mdash;lover of <HI>mankande,</HI> Gla&s;tonberry thorn.-r-huzza, boys.&mdash;Wit a vivacious command of all objects and ideas.&mdash;I am the only wit in Great Britain. See Oratory tracts, &amp;c. 10036.&endq;</P>
<P>Patience, good Mr. Q$ator! We are not at lei&s;ure to an&s;wer thee at pre&s;ent, but mu&s;t ob&s;erve that <HI>Jargon</HI> has done more for our hero, than ever did the &s;ociety at Bordeaux, as will ap|pear from the following extract of a letter &s;ent to MARTINUS MACULARIUS, by a fellow of that &s;ociety:</P>
<P>J$ai bitn re&ccedil;u la le$tre, dont vous m'a$ez fait l'honneur le $ame pa&s;s&eacute;.

<P>M. MACULARI$S.</P>
<P><HI>Dulne&s;s made</HI>] This pa&s;&s;age may be properly illu&s;trated by a recollection of two lines in Mr. POPE's e&s;&s;ay on critici&s;m.</P>
<Q><L>As things &s;eem large which we thro' mi&s;ts de&s;ecy,</L>
<L>Dulne&s;s is very apt to magnify.</L></Q>
<P><HI>Wooden lion roar'd.</HI>] Not the black lion in Sali&s;bury-court, Fleet-&s;treet, where the New Craft&s;man is publi&s;hed, nor yet the red lion at Brentford, but the bea&s;t of the Bedford, who may truly be &s;aid to have been alive, when animated by Ad|di&s;on and Steel, though now reduced to that &s;tate of Block|headi&s;m, which is &s;o con&s;picuous in his ma&s;ter. <HI>Ficulnus, in|utile lignum!.</HI></P>
<P>BENTLEY, junior.</P>
<P><HI>A full di&s;charge,</HI>] Reader do not turn up your no&s;e at this pa&s;&s;age! it is much more decent th$n POPE's&mdash;Recollect what SWIFT &s;ays, that a nice man has filthy ideas, and let it be con|&s;idered &s;idered this di&s;charge may have the &s;ame effect upon our hero, as a &s;imilar accident had upon a per&s;on of equal parts and genius.</P>
<Q><L>Renew'd by ordure's &s;ympathetic force,</L>
<L>As oil'd by magic juices for the cour&s;e,</L>

<P><HI>Archimedes, co</HI>] As &s;oon as the Philo&s;opher here mentioned di&s;covered the modern <HI>Save-all,</HI> and the <HI>New-invented patent black-ball,</HI> he threw down his pipe, and ran all along Piccadilly, with his &s;hirt out of his breeches, crving out like a madman, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">! which in modern Engli&s;h is, the job is done! the job is done!</P>
<P>VETUS SCHOL.</P>
<P><HI>Another Duck,</HI>] Hillario having a mind to celebrate and re|commend a genius to the world, compares him to Stephen Duck, and at the clo&s;e of a late INSPECTOR, cries$out, &startq;I have found another Duck, but who &s;hall find a Caroline?&endq;</P>
<P><HI>Print my &s;oft e&s;&s;ays,</HI>] Our hero for once has &s;poke truth of him&s;elf, for which we could produce the te&s;timonies of &s;everal per&s;ons of di&s;tinction. Bath and Tunbridgewells have upon many occa&s;ions te&s;tified their gratitude to him on this head, as his works have been always found of &s;ingular u&s;e with the waters of tho&s;e places. To this effect al&s;o &s;peaketh that excellent commedian, Mr. Henry Woodward, in an ingenious parody <HI>on bu&s;y, curious, thir&s;ty fly, &amp;c.</HI></P>

<P><HI>And now, thou Godde&s;s, &amp;c.</HI>] This invocation is perfectly in the &s;pirit of ancient poetry. If I may u&s;e Milton's words, our author here pre&s;umes into the heavens, an earthly gue&s;t, and draws empyreal air. Hence he calls upon the Godde&s;s to a&s;&s;i&s;t his &s;train, while he relates the councils of the Gods. VIRGIL, when the plot thickens upon his hands, as Mr. Byes has it, has offered up his prayers a &s;econd time to the Mu&s;e, and he &s;eems to labour under: the weight of his &s;ubject, when he cries out,
<Q><HI>Mo$us</HI> of us moveo, major rerum mihi na&s;citur ordo.</Q>
This is the ca&s;e at pre&s;ent with the writer of the HILLIAD, and this piece of$machinery will evince the ab&s;urdity of that Lucretian doctrine, which a&s;&s;erts that the Gods are wrapped up in a lazy indolence, and do not trouble them&s;elves about human affairs. The words of Lucretius are,
<Q><L>Omn$s enim per &s;e div&ucirc;m natura nece&s;&s;ee&s;t&punc;</L>
<L>Immortali a$v. &s;umma cum pace fruatur,</L>

<P>It is now recommended to the editors of the Anti-Lucretius
to make u&s;e of this in&s;tance to the contrary in the next publi|cation of that work.&mdash;</P>
<P>M. MACULARIUS.</P>
<P><HI>Incumier'd &s;pace</HI>] Jupiter's &s;peech is full of pomp and &s;o|lemnity, and is finely clo&s;ed by a de&s;cription of our hero, who is here &s;aid to take up a place in the creation to no purpo&s;e. What a different notion of the end of his exi&s;tence has Hilla|rio, from what we find delivered by the excellent Longinus in his treati&s;e on the &s;ublime. The pa&s;&s;age is admirable, tran&s;lated by the author of the plea&s;ures of imagination. &startq;The Godlike geniu&s;es of Greece were well-a&s;&s;ured that nature had not intended man for a low &s;pirited or ignoble being; but bringing us into life and the mid&s;t of this wide univer&s;e, as before a multitude a&s;&s;embled at &s;ome heroic &s;olemnity, that we might be &s;pectators of all her magnifi|cence, and candidates high in emulation for the prize of glory&punc; &s;he has therefore implanted in our &s;ouls an inextin|gui&s;hable love of every thing great and exalted, of every thing which appears divine beyond our comprehen&s;ion. Hence by the very propen&s;ity of nature we are led to ad|mire, not little &s;prings or &s;hallow rivulets, however clear and delicious, but the Nile, the Rhine, the Danube, and much more than all the Ocean.&endq;&mdash;In&s;tead of acting upon this plan, Hillario is employed in pur&s;uit of in&s;ects in Ken|&s;ington-gardens, and as this is all the gratitude he pays for the being conferred upon him, he is finely termed an In&s;olvent tenant.</P>
<P><HI>By adoptior&punc; be the fire, &amp;c.</HI>] Our hero has taken an entire letter from Sir Thomas Fnz-O&s;borne, and with inimitable effrontery publi&s;hed it in his INSPECTOR, NO. 239, as a pro|duction of his own. We are informed that having been taxed with this affair, he declares with a great deal of art, that it was given him by another per&s;on, to which all we have to &s;ay is, that, the receiver is as bad as the thief.</P>
<P>M. MACULARIUS.</P>
<P><HI>Gierious to procure.</HI>] If our author could be thought capable of punning, I &s;hould imagine that the word <HI>procure,</HI> in this place, is made u&s;e of in preference to an appellation given to our hero in the commencement of this poem, viz. a <HI>Pimp,</HI> but the reader will plea&s;e to recollect that the term <HI>Pimp</HI> is not in that pa&s;&s;age u&s;ed in its modern acceptation.</P>
<P><HI>Small was th' exertion, &amp;c</HI>] Not &s;o fa&s;t, good poet, cries out in this place, M. MACULARIUS. We do not find that HIL|LARIO, upon any occa&s;ion whatever, has been charged with &s;tealing Apollo's quiver, and certain it is, that tho&s;e arrows, which he has &s;hot at all the word, never were taken from thence. But of Mercury it is recorded by HORACE, that he really did deceive the God of wit in this manner;
<Q><L>Te boves elim ni&s;&igrave; reddidi&s;&s;es</L>
<L>Per dolum amotas, puerum minaci</L>
<L>Voce dum terret viduus pharetra</L>
<L>Ri&s;it Apollo.</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Venus next expre&s;s'd,</HI>] Venus ri&s;es in this a&s;&s;embly quite in the manner attributed to her in the ancient poets; thus we &s;ee in VIRGIL that &s;he is all mildne&s;s, and at every word breathes Ambro&s;ia;
<Q><L>&mdash;At non Venus aurea contra,</L>
<L>Pauca refert.&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>She is to &s;peak upon this occa&s;ion, as well as in the ca&s;e pro|duced from the Aeneid, in favour of a much loved &s;on, though indeed we cannot &s;ay that &s;he has been quite &s;o kind. to Hilla|rio, as formerly &s;he was to Aeneas, it being evident that &s;he has not be&s;towed upon him that lu&s;tre of youthful bloom, and that liquid radiance of the eye, which &s;he is &s;aid to have given the pious Trojan.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;L$$$enque juventae</L>
<L>Purpureum, et laetos oculis afflavit honores.</L></Q>
<P>On the contrary Venus here talks of his black &s;elf, which makes it &s;u&s;pected that &s;he reconciled her&s;elf to this hue, out of a compliment to Vulcan, of whom &s;he has frequent fa|vours to &s;olicit: and perhaps it may appear hereafter, that &s;he procured a &s;word for our hero from the cele&s;tial black|&s;mith's forge. One thing is not a little &s;urprizing, that, while Venus &s;peaks on the &s;ide of Hillario, &s;he &s;hould omit the real utility he has been of to the cau&s;e of love by his experience as an apothecary, of which he him&s;elf hath told us, &s;everal have profited; and it &s;hould be remembered at the &s;ame time, that he actually has employed his per&s;on in the &s;ervice of Venus, and has now an offspring of the amorous congre&s;s. It is moreover notorious, that having, in his elegant language, ta&s;ted of the cool &s;tream, he was ready to plunge in again, and therefore publicly &s;et him&s;elf up for a wife, and thus, became a fortune-hunter with his pen, and if he has failed in his de|&s;ign, it is becau&s;e the ladies do not approve the new &s;cheme of propagation without the knowledge of a man, which Hil|lario pretended to explain &s;o hand&s;omely in the <HI>Lucina &s;ine concubitu.</HI>&mdash;But the truth is, he never wrote a &s;yllable of this book, though he tran&s;cribed part of it, and &s;hewed it to a book&s;eller, in order to procure a higher price for his pro|ductions.</P>
<P>QUIN$US FLESTRIN.</P>
<P><HI>Diamond in an Aethiop's ear,</HI>] There is neither morality, nor integrity, nor unity, nor univer&s;ality in this poem.&mdash;The au|thor of it is a SMART; I hope to &s;ee a SMARTEAD publi&s;hed; I had my pocket picked the other day, as I was going through Paul's Church-yard, and I firmly believe it was this little au|thor, as the man who can pun, will al&s;o pick a pocket.</P>

<HI>Inanity</HI></P>
<P><HI>Inanity will ever be, &amp;c.]</HI> Our author does not here mean to li&s;t him&s;elf among the di&s;putants concerning pure &s;pace, but the doctrine he would advance, is, that nothing can come from nothing. In &s;o unbelieving an age as this, it is po&s;&s;ible this tenet may not be received, but if the reader has a mind to &s;ee it handled at large, he may find it in Rumgurtius, vol. 16, pagi$a 1001. &startq;De hac re multum et turpiter hallucinantur &s;criptores tam exteri quam dome&s;tici. Spatium enim ab|&s;olutum et relativum debe$t di&s;tingui, priu&s;quam di&s;tincta e&s;&s;e po&s;&s;unt; neque ulla alia regula ad normam rei meta|phy&s;ic&acirc; quadrabit, quam triplex con&s;ideratio de &s;ub&s;tanti&acirc; inanitatis, &s;ive entitate nihili, quae quidem con&s;ideratio tri|plex ad unam reduci pote&s;t nece&s;&s;itatem; nempe idem &s;pa|tium de quo jam &s;atis dictum e&s;t.&endq; This opinion is further corroborated by the tracts of the &s;ociety of Bourdeaux. &startq;Se|lon la di&s;tinction entre les cho&s;es, qui n'ont pas de diffe|rence, il nous faut ab&s;olument agr&eacute;er, que les id&eacute;es, qui ont frapp&eacute; l'imagination, peuvent bien &ecirc;tre effac&eacute;es, pourvu qu'on ne s'avi&s;e pas d'oublier cet e&s;pace immen&s;e, qui envi|ronne toute la nature, et le &s;y&s;t&eacute;me des &eacute;toiles.&endq; Among our countrymen, I do not know any body that has handled this &s;ubject &s;o well as the accurate Mr. Fielding, in his e&s;&s;ay upon Nothing, which the reader may find in the fir&s;t volume of his mi&s;cellanies; but with all due deference to his autho|rity, we beg leave to di&s;&s;ent from one a&s;&s;ertion in the &s;aid e&s;&s;ay; the re&s;idence of nothing might in his time have been in a critick's head, and we are apt to believe that there is a &s;omething like nothing in mo&s;t critick's heads to this day, and this fal&s;e appearance mi&s;led the excellent metaphy&s;ician ju&s;t quoted; for nothing, in its <HI>puris naturelibus,</HI> as Grave&s;end de&s;cribes it in his experimental philo&s;ophy, doe$ &s;ub&s;i&s;t no where &s;o properly at pre&s;ent as in the pericranium of our hero.</P>
<P>MART. MACULARIUS.</P>
<P><HI>Mu&s;ick &s;lows,</HI>] Per&s;ons of mo&s;t genius, &s;ays the INSPECTOR, Friday Jan. 26, Number 587, &startq;have in general been the fonde&s;t of mu&s;ick; Sir I&s;aac Newton was remarkable for his affection for harmony; he was &s;carce ever mi&s;&s;ed at the beginning of any performance, but was &s;eldom &s;een at the end of it.&endq; And indeed of this opinion is M. MACULA|RIUS; and he further adds, that if Sir I&s;aac was &s;till living it is probable he would be at the beginning of the INSPECTOR's next &s;ong at Cuper's, but that he would not be at the end of it, may be proved to a mathematical demon&s;tration, though Hillario takes &s;omuch plea&s;ure in beating time to them him&s;elf, and though he &s;o frequently exclaims, very fine!&mdash;O fine!&mdash;va&s;tly fine!&mdash;Since the lucubration of Friday Jan. 26th has been mentioned, we think proper to ob&s;erve here, that his IN|SPECTORSHIP has the mo&s;t notable talent at a motto&mdash;QUIN|BUS FLESTRIN &s;aith, &startq;he is a tartar for that,&endq; and of this, Jearned reader, take a &s;pecimen along with you. How aptly upon the &s;ubject of mu&s;ick does he bid his readers pluck grapes from the loaded vine!</P>
<Q>Carpite de plenis pendentes vitibus uvas. <HI>OVID.</HI></Q>
<P>The above-mentioned QUINBUS FLESTRIN, peremptorily &s;ays, this line has been cavilled at by &s;ome minor critics, be|cau&s;e, &startq;the grapes are &s;our;&endq; and indeed of that way of thinking is MACULARIUS, who hath been greatly a&s;toni&s;hed at the ta&s;te of Hillario, in &s;o frequently culling from Valerius Flaccus. But he is clearly of opinion, that the lines from Wel&s;tead and Dennis, are &s;elefcted with great judgment, and are hung out as proper &s;igns of what entertainment is to be furni&s;hed up to his cu&s;tomers.</P>
<P><HI>Penumbra of a thing,</HI>] Whatever mean opinion Dr. Phoebus may entertain of his terre&s;tial brother phy&s;ician and poet: on earth, Hillario is talked of in a different manner, as will ap|pear from the following parody on the lines prefixed by Mr.|DRYDEN, to Milton's Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t$.</P>

<P>&startq;SIR,&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;From a motive of gratitude, and for the &s;ake of tho&s;e of my fellow-creatures, who may unhappily be afflicted; as I have been for &s;ome time pa&s;t, I beg leave, through the channel of your paper, to communicate the di&s;order I have laboured under, and the extraordinary cure I have lately met with. I have had for many months &s;ucce&s;&s;ively a &s;low nervous fever, with a con&s;tant $lutter on my &s;pirits, attend|ed with pertinacious watchings, twitchings of the nerves, &startq;and other grievous &s;ymptoms, which reduced me to a mere &s;hadow. At length, by the interpo&s;ition of divine provi|dence, a friend who had him&s;elf experienced it, advi&s;ed me to have recour&s;e to the reading of the INSPECTORS. I ac|cordingly took one of them, and the effect it had upon me was &s;uch, that I fell into a profound &s;leep, which la&s;ted near &s;ix and thirty hours. By this I have attained a more compo&s;ed habit of body, and I now doze away almo&s;t all my time, but for fear of a lethargy, am ordered to take them in &s;maller quantities. A paragraph at a time now an&s;wers my purpo&s;e, and under heaven I owe my &s;leeping powers to the above-mentioned INSPECTORS. I look upon them to be a grand &s;oporificum mirabile, very proper to be had in all families. He makes great allowance to tho&s;e who by them to &s;ell again, or to &s;end abroad to the plantations; and the above fact I am ready to atte&s;t when|ever called upon. Given under my hand this 4th day of January, 1753.&endq;</P>

<P>M. MACULARIUS.</P>
<P><HI>The trumpet; &amp;c.]</HI> In a very plea&s;ant account of the riots in Drury-lane Play-hou&s;e, by Henry Fielding, E&s;&abque; we find the following humorous de&s;cription of our hero in the character of a trumpeter. &startq;They all ran away except the trumpeter, who having an empyema in his &s;ide, as well as &s;everal dreadful brui&s;es on his breech, was taken. When he was brought before Garrick to be examined, he &s;aid the ninnies, to whom he had the honour to be trumpeter, had re&s;ented the u&s;e made of the mon&s;ters by Garrick. That it was unfair, that it was cruel, that it was inhuman to employ a man's own &s;ubjects again&s;t him. That Rich was lawful &s;overeign over all the mon&s;ters in the uni|ver&s;e, with much more of the &s;ame kind; all which Garrick &s;eemed to think unworthy of an an&s;wer; but when the trum|peter challenged him as his acquaintance, the chief with great di&s;dain turned his back, and ordered the fellow to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with full power of trumpeting again on what &s;ide he plea&s;ed;.&endq; Hillario has &s;ince trumpeted in the cau&s;e of Pantomime, the gaudy &s;cenery of which with great judgment he di&s;mi&s;&s;es from the Opera-hou&s;e, and &s;aith, it is now fixed in its proper place in the theatre. On this occa&s;ion, MAGULARIUS cannot help exclaiming, &startq;O Shake&s;pear! O John&s;on! re&s;t, re&s;t per|turbed &s;pirits.&endq;</P>
<P><HI>Handel, Arne, and Boyce,</HI>] The fir&s;t of the&s;e gentlemen may be ju&s;tly looked upon as the Milton of mu&s;ick, and the talent$ of the two latter may not improperly be delineated by callings them the Drydens of their profe&s;&s;ion, as they not only touch the &s;trings of love with exqui&s;ite art, but al&s;o, when they plea&s;e, reach the truly &s;ublime.</P>
<P><HI>Hogarth is the Garrick, &amp;c.]</HI> The opinion which Mr. Hogarth entertains of our hero's writings, may be gue&s;s'd at, by any one who will take the plea&s;ure of looking at a print called Beer-&s;treet, in which Hillario's critique upon the Royal Soci|ety is put into a ba&s;ket directed to the trunk-maker in St. Paul's Church-yard. I &s;hall only ju&s;t ob&s;erve that the com|pliment in this pa&s;&s;age to Mr. Hogarth is reciprocal, and re|flects a lu&s;tre on Mr. Garrick, both of them having &s;imilar talents, equally capable of the highe&s;t elevation, and of repre|&s;enting the ordinary &s;cenes of life, with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite humour.</P>
<P><HI>Conclu&s;ion.]</HI> And now candid reader, MARTINUS MACU|LARIUS hath attended thee throughout the fir&s;t book of this mo&s;t delectable poem.
