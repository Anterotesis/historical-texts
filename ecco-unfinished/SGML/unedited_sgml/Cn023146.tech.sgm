<HEAD>Scotland in Danger,
OR,
A Serious Enquiry into the Dangers which SCOTLAND
has been in, is now in, or may be in &s;ince the
UNION;
With &s;ome Humble Propo&s;als for the REMEDY.</HEAD>
<P>HE that Undertakes to In&s;truct a Nation, ought to be very
well Fortified again&s;t publick Reproach. In this Wi&s;e Age
Men are apt to be ill Natur'd, when you pretend to Inform
them, and the Wi&s;dom they think they have Qualifies them
immediately to think they want no Teaching.</P>
<P>$However this may happen, Gentlemen in the North of <HI>Britain,</HI>
here is one that think$ him&s;elf Oblig'd to venture to &s;peak <HI>a Word $word$
Sea&s;on</HI> to you; he hopes you that have no Need of it, <HI>or that think you
have none, for that is almo&s;t the &s;ame thing,</HI> will bear with it for the &s;ake
of &s;ome, that having le&s;s$ Wit than you may want it.</P>
<P>He Profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf convinc'd, that what he &s;hall &s;ay is not only
Truth, but u&s;eful Truth, and as &s;uch, he hopes you will Improve it
to your own Advantage; but whether you will or no, he Acknow|ledges
him&s;elf unable to Refrain in mee$ Re&s;pect to your Welfare,
and mov'd with a Sen&s;e of your Danger.</P>
<P>And he is per&s;waded, that what he &s;hall &s;ay now, will have &s;o
much Force with it, &s;o evidently clear up his &s;incere Intentions for
your Good, and be &s;o Convincing to all your Judgments, that he
hopes for a more favourable Reception on now than ever.</P>
<P>The Title of this Paper is like a Man crying Fire in your Streets,
upon the fir&s;t Allarm, at which your immediate Inquiry is, <HI>Where&punc;
<PB N="2" REF="2" MS="Y">
where?</HI> When a Stranger comes among you and cryes out, Danger,
Danger, <HI>Scotland</HI> in Danger, he ought to be furni&s;h$ to An&s;wer your
immediate Enquiry, from whence? What is it? and what are we in
Danger from?</P>
<P>Let me therefore fir&s;t Examine the&s;e Dangers; for the Di&s;ea&s;e mu&s;t
be known before the Cure be pre&s;cribed&mdash;. The Dangers to be
hinted at may be divided
<LIST>
<ITEM>Into
<LIST>
<ITEM>Dangers pa&s;t.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Dangers pre&s;ent.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Dangers to come.</ITEM>
</LIST></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>By Dangers pa&s;t is to be Under&s;tood, <HI>&s;uch as &s;eem to be pa&s;t;</HI> for if
they were really pa&s;t, they would be no Dangers&mdash;: And yet I
&s;hall not &s;ay much to put you upon the Unea&s;ine&s;s of expecting their
Return.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> have made an Attempt upon you, and this is meant by
the <HI>Dangers pa&s;t:</HI> It is not the De&s;ign of this Paper to put you in Fear
of their Return$, but neither do I think you ought to try whether you
can Tempt them to come again or no.</P>
<P>Pray, Gentlemen, will you then look back to what prompted them
to come here before; we are told of Invitations and Per&s;onal En|couragements;
<HI>I have nothing to &s;ay</HI> to tho&s;e things, a Man can
hardly imagine any Man &s;o cruel to his Countrey, as to call in the
<HI>French;</HI> if any &s;uch thing was. I believe all Hone&s;t Men will joyn <HI>in
this Wi&s;$&punc;</HI> that it may be Detected, and the Per&s;ons brought to Ju&s;tice:
But till it is proved I &s;ay nothing$ but <HI>Curra$ Lex,</HI> the Government is
Fi&s;hing for it, let it go as it will.</P>
<P>But &s;hall I tell you, Friends and Countrey Men, very plainly, you
have all been Guilty of Inviting over the <HI>French;</HI> not that I am going
to Pannel you all now <HI>Lae&s;ae Maje&s;tatis,</HI> and call you all Traitours by
Craft; but take me right, Gentlemen, I mu&s;t &s;ay it again, you have
all been Guilty of Inviting over the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>To Explain my &s;elf and prove this, I &s;hall briefly Name particulars.
1. Your naked Po&s;ture as to Defence has been a Call to your Enemies,
who, not doubting of a &s;trong Party among you, mu&s;t needs think
the Strength you have had, was a mo&s;t contemptible thing to prevent
a Surprize: Your Unfortified Coa&s;t, your Unfurni&s;hed Forts, your Few
Forces, your Un&s;ettled Militia, the&s;e have all been &s;trong Invitations
to the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>But as the&s;e are the Effects of your yet Settling, and Un&s;ettled Infant
<PB N="3" REF="3">
State <HI>as to the Union,</HI> &s;o the Government &s;eems Vigorous in their
Application to Re&s;tore you in tho&s;e Ca&s;es to a State of Defence, and
therefore this can be no part of the Danger of Inviting the Enemy to
Return. I Wi&s;h the next Ca&s;e &s;tood as fair for a Cure.</P>
<Q><P>2. The Number and Armed Po&s;ture of your Indwelling Enemies,
from whom &s;uch an Inva&s;ion as we are Talking of is made but too
$eazible: But of this hereafter.</P>
<P>3. And which is the main Point, your Divi&s;ions at Home; your
Party Divi&s;ions, your Religious Divi&s;ions, your <HI>Jacobite</HI> Divi&s;ions,
your Popi&s;h Divi&s;ions, and at la&s;t, your Union Divi&s;ions, <HI>an
unhappy Word that is!</HI> The&s;e were, and &s;till are the Invitations to
a Foreign Enemy; the&s;e brought him Over, and the&s;e alone ca$
Endanger his Return.</P></Q>
<P>In the&s;e things I place the Dangers of <HI>Scotland</HI> pa&s;t: I &s;hall
Recapitulate them again pre&s;ently&punc; but I fir&s;t pa&s;s on to the Generals.
The <HI>Second</HI> Head is of Dangers pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The&s;e ari&s;e from a mi&s;erable Dearth of Charity and Neighbourhood,
and a &s;trange Contagion of Strife and Di&s;affection to one another,
which is &s;pread among us, and which threatens this Countrey with
innumerable Mi&s;chiefs and Di&s;orders. And this contains the Third
Head, <HI>viz.</HI> Of Dangers to come: You will Pardon me for joining
the Cau&s;es and the Con&s;equences together.</P>
<P>I have always been a Foreteller of Good from the Union, and have
put you in hopes of much upon that Head; but, Gentlemen, pray
Remember this, <HI>and bear Witne&s;s for me,</HI> I never told <HI>Britain</HI> on either
hand, North or South, that the Union would do you good <HI>whether
you would or no;</HI> that in &s;pight of Jarring Parties, Ambitious Intere&s;ts,
Unnatural Strifes, and the &s;preading Poi&s;ons of Envy, Party Malice,
and the like, the Union would make you happy.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, &s;hall I tell you a new, but plain and po&s;itive Truth, and I
lay it down as <HI>a The&s;is,</HI> which I &s;hall Enlarge upon a little hereafter:
If you will not add Peace to Union, it is impo&s;&s;ible you &s;hould Reap
any Advantage by it; if you will not joyn mutual A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and
bring an Uniting Temper and the Union together, even God him&s;elf,
<HI>I &s;peak it with an awful Concern for you,</HI> can not without Working &s;ome|thing
Miraculous, and out of the ordinary Cour&s;e of his Providence,
make the Union Effectual to you.</P>
<P>Shall I be plain, and lead you back a little by the Hand to &s;ee the want
of this Temper? What Objections any have made again&s;t the Union I have
<PB N="4" REF="4">
nothing to &s;ay to here, nor why they made them; But has there been
no Imprudence in the Manner, no Extreams in your Aver&s;ions to the
Union, and particularly in the Expre&s;&s;ions of it in Publick?</P>
<P>I &s;peak it without boa&s;ting, No Man has concern'd him&s;elf more than
the Author of this Paper to clear up the Su&s;pition Entertained among your
Brethren in <HI>England</HI> of the Presbyterians in <HI>Scotland</HI> Joining with the
<HI>French,</HI> and falling in with the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Intere&s;t, But &s;hall I ask you, Gentle|men
calmly, Did not the Warmth of &s;ome People here in Declaring them|&s;elves
even on the Newsof the <HI>French</HI> Preparations, too much a&s;&s;i&s;t your
Enemies to rai&s;e that Scandal on you? yes and too much Encourage
the <HI>French</HI> to expect it would be true; To what other purpo&s;e could
it tend, and what a Handle did you thereby give your Enemies to
attack you, how much Di&s;courage your Friends in <HI>England</HI> in their Ex|pectations
from you, and weaken their hands in helping you?</P>
<P>Shall I go further, Did not the&s;e Imprudent Excur&s;ions help to bring
forward the unhappy Difficulty of Impo&s;ing Oaths? Did not this help
to make tho&s;e A&s;&s;urances &s;eem needful, even to tho&s;e who had no
mind to put hard&s;hips upon you, and give Pretence to tho&s;e that
had?</P>
<P><HI>Abroad,</HI> The&s;e were the common Arguments about <HI>Scotland, Fir&s;t,</HI> The
Epi&s;copal and <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party, they are ready to Clo&s;e with the <HI>French,</HI>
and, (2.) As for the Presbyterian Party, they are &s;o generally Surfeited
with, and Di&s;gu&s;ted at the Union, that they will come in only to get the
Union Di&s;&s;olved, or at lea&s;t will &s;tand Neuter.</P>
<P>This was the Language both of your Friends and Enemies: It was the
Language of your Enemies as they made u&s;e of it to prompt the
<HI>French</HI> King to the Attempt, to Di&s;courage the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in their
Oppo&s;ition, and to blow up the vain Hope of their Party in <HI>England</HI> to
a&s;&s;i&s;t in your De&s;truction; and it was the Language of your Friends,
as it was the Effect of their Fears for you, the Report having been
Univer&s;al, and no Body contradicting it.</P>
<P>I can but touch the&s;e things here, perhaps I may &s;peak more largely
to them again&punc; I wi&s;h they were heartily con&s;idered among us all, not
to accu&s;e one another, and rectiminate upon one another, but to cor|rect
every Man for him&s;elf, whatever Share he has had in it.</P>
<P>And let us come now to our pre&s;ent State, The <HI>French</HI> have been at
our Doors, GOD had brought the Nation upon us threatned in the
$word$ <HI>Deut. 50, 51. A Nation from a far Countrey, of a fierce Countenance,
and who would not regard the Per&s;on of the Old, nor &s;hew Favour to the Young,
<PB N="5" REF="5">
that &s;hould eat the Fruit of our Cattel, and the Fruit of our Land, and &s;hould
leave us neither Corn nor Wine&punc; nor Oil, until he had de&s;troyed us.</HI>
But He has had Compa&s;&s;ion upon us, and &s;aved us from our Fears
and the Storm is blown over&punc; the black Cloud hovered over us,&mdash;but
the Thunder brake not upon us.</P>
<P>Some have promi&s;ed them &s;elves, that as the French have done us
no Harm, they have done us a great deal of Good, and rationally
&s;peaking, one would think it &s;hould be &s;o.</P>
<P>Could you but realize the Dangers you have e&s;caped, could you
but form Ideas of the Operation of this dreadful Phy&s;ick, had it been
admini&s;tred, me thinks it mu&s;t have an Influence upon your Judgments,
your Wi&s;hes, and your Practice.</P>
<P>Do but fancy the <HI>French</HI> Landed at <HI>Leith,</HI> with a Superior Force to
what you had here to re&s;i&s;t them; imagine the Earl of <HI>Leven</HI> retreated
with the little Army you had here towards <HI>Berwick,</HI> as in the Prudence
of a General he might be &s;uppo&s;ed to do.</P>
<P>Imagine then <HI>Edinburgh &s;urrendred</HI> to the <HI>French,</HI> which I pre&s;ume no
Man will pretend to &s;uppo&s;e could be avoided; nay, perhaps you
would have been obliged to have entreated the <HI>French</HI> to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on
to protect you from wor&s;e indwelling Enemies, and more terrible
Rabbles$</P>
<P>When the <HI>French</HI> were in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, you could not have expected le&s;s
from them than &s;uch things as the&s;e.</P>
<Q><P><HI>1&s;t.</HI> That they &s;hould &s;ummon your Magi&s;trates together, and
oblige them to proclaim their New Pretender.</P>
<P><HI>2dly.</HI> That they &s;hould then &s;ummon the Inhabitants to &s;wear Al|legiance
to him, and perhaps renounce the Revolution and Succe&s;&s;i|on
as an Equivalent for the Ab$uration.</P>
<P><HI>3dly,</HI> Make Proclamation, that all that were fled or ab&s;conded
&s;hould return to their Habitation, on pain of Con$i&s;cation of
Goods, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Le&s;s than this I am per&s;waded, no man can imagine rational, that
knows any thing of National Revolutions, what Riflings and Exactions
of Contributions might be added, I do not enquire.</P>
<P>Upon this new Oath,&mdash;what Sacrifices would have been made,
what Martyrdoms &s;uffered, what Inundation of Highlanders, what
Rabbling, what Plunder, and what Blood, I refer to your &s;edate
<PB N="6" REF="6">
Thoughts to reflect on; and I &s;hall tell you pre&s;ently what u&s;e I make
of all this. Well, this Scene of Danger is over$ behold another!</P>
<P>Now we are come to choo&s;ing a new <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament$ a Cri&s;is
which this Nation never met with before: and &s;hall I confe&s;s now,
<HI>for I would be impartial,</HI> that I think the Union will do you &s;ome
Harm here; I mean, in infecting you with the Horrid Bribeties, Parti|alities,
Envvings, and Party making practi&s;ed too much in <HI>England,</HI>
and which Hone&s;t Men have &s;truggled both in Parliament, and out of
Parliament, to re&s;train.</P>
<P>I cannot but mention it as a thing melancholly enough, to &s;ee the
Gentlemen and Noblemen of <HI>Britain</HI> making a perfect War among
them&s;elves, to obtain an Employment of Peace; a War of Families, and
a War of Intere&s;ts; what Strife, wh$ t Contention, what Envying,
Siding, and Party-making, to get into a Station, which their Country
ought to hire them to di&s;charge.</P>
<P>What can the meaning of this be, Gentlemen? That People &s;hould
&s;pend their Money, give Bribes and Rewards, and be at Expen&s;e to Sit
in a place where they cannot get one Groat Hone&s;tly by &s;itting? There
mu&s;t be &s;omething more in this than is known; this mu&s;t be &s;ome Fi|gure
in Politicks, like <HI>a Me$$$s</HI> in Speech$ in which there is more &s;igni|fied
than is expre&s;&s;ed&mdash;. And what &s;hall we &s;ay to <HI>Andrew Marvel</HI>'s
$ld Proverb, that <HI>he that B$y$ mu&s;t Sell.</HI> I will not explain it as look|ing
&s;o here; but his Meaning he explain'd publickly to be, That he
that would buy the Country to Choo&s;e him, would &s;ell the Country
when they had Cho&s;en him: Nay he went further, he &s;aid they MUST
do &s;o, that is, <HI>to get their Money again.</HI> It is indeed an unaccountable
thing, that a Man &s;hould &s;pend a Thou&s;and Pound to get leave to go
to <HI>London</HI> where he mu&s;t perhaps &s;pend 500 more&punc; meerly for the &s;er|vice
of his Country, and get nothing by it, and $word$ too in an Age,
when every body knows they have long le$t off the Folly of being
publick Spirited, as a thing ob&s;ole$e, and quite out of Fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>Hi&s;tory tells us a Story of <HI>William R$$$$,</HI> the Second King of <HI>England</HI>
from the Conque&s;t; That having an Abby to be&s;tow in Gi$$&punc; Several of
the Clergy knowing the King to be Cove$ous, bid large Sums for the
place; the King &s;eing a Monk $$and by that offered nothing, and took no
notice of it, asked him, <HI>And what wilt thou g$ve for this Abbay?</HI> Indeed
not one Peny; <HI>&s;ays the Monk,</HI> for it is again&s;t my Con&s;cience. <HI>Then,</HI>
&s;ays the King, <HI>Thou art the fitte&s;t Man to be A$$ot,</HI> and &s;o gave him the
Abby immediately.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="7">
The Application is very &s;hort Gentlemen; You have here a great
many In&s;tructors that &s;et up to teach you, and p$etend to advi&s;e you
<HI>who to choo&s;e,</HI> &s;ome one &s;ort, &s;ome another; will you but plea&s;e to take
the Moral of this Story, and you will need no bodys In&s;truction; do
but choo&s;e the Men that will not &s;pend one Peny to be cho&s;e; Men that
will not go over their Thre&s;holds to to be Cho&s;e&mdash;Men that in Con&s;ci|ence
cannot bribe, nor buy your Voices, a Man may without Hazard
pledge his Life, that &s;uch a Man will &s;erve you Impartially when he is
cho&s;en.</P>
<P>But this Bribing, Treating, making Partys and Intere&s;ts to be cho|&s;en
is a wicked <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cu&s;tom&mdash;, and what has been the end of it,
truly that <HI>England</HI> has been at the Brink of De&s;truction by Bribing
and bribed Members, when of 513 Members, 180 were Pen&s;ioners to
the King, hired to vote as he liked, and to give away the Nations Mo|ney
whenever he asked it&mdash;. This was the time when two Gentlemen
in Kent, Sir <HI>John Banks</HI> and Collonel <HI>Draper</HI> by Name, &s;pend 11000
<HI>lib.</HI> Sterling at one Election, to get into Parliament at a little Town
called <HI>Winchel&s;ea,</HI> all the Hou&s;es in which were not worth a quarter part
of the Money.</P>
<P>Now as the&s;e Men got Pen&s;ions <HI>when in,</HI> for Services they were to do;
there was &s;ome Rea&s;on to be &s;hown why they &s;hould &s;pend Money
but as the Members now cho&s;en can expect no &s;uch Clande&s;tine do|ings,
what can be the Meaning now of this unhappy Practice?</P>
<P>Shall I tell you, the de&s;ign, it is equally wicked now, and perhaps in
its kind as pernicious, <HI>viz.</HI> Supporting Parties, clubing and forming
Cla&s;&s;es, and Clans in the Hou&s;e of Commons, in which is couched the
Ruine of our Peace, the Overthrow of the Admini&s;tration, and the in|volving
us in innumerable Confu&s;ions.</P>
<P>Let but your Eyes look round you, and &s;ee, Gentlemen, what ab&s;ur|dities
begin to be practi&s;ed among you, and what a War of Intere&s;t is
here begun already, and where it will end, GOD knows.</P>
<P>Here Whigs put up Tories, and Vote again&s;t Whig$: There Tories put up Whigs,
and Vote again&s;t Tories; here Party interferes with Relation, and there with Religi|on;
Here Papi&s;ts &s;olicit for Whigs, and <HI>Jacobites</HI> take the Oath $o Vote for Revolution
Men There Epi&s;copal Men Qualifie to Vote for Presbyterians, Fathers Vote again&s;t their
Sons, and Kindred again&s;t Kindred, no Cla$s are ob&s;erved or regarded in Electing,
and Party Supercedes Relation.</P>
<P>And what does all this &s;ay to us, but progno&s;ticate a mi&s;erable &s;elf intere&s;ted
Game, pur&s;uing Parties, and &s;waying for publick Managements, not regarding the
Countreys Intere&s;t, or &s;o much as thinking of the Duty and Tru&s;t of a Repre&s;enta|tive.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="8">
Here I could open a large Scene of Dangers wor&s;e than <HI>French</HI> Inva&s;ions, or <HI>Alman|&s;a</HI>
Victories, Dangers that reach the Vitals of <HI>Britain,</HI> and threaten the Teeming Uni|on
with in&s;tant abortions; Dangers, that in Spight of all Pro&s;pect, will Defeat the
Advantages both Nations might re$p by the hearty Pur&s;uit of it, and Dangers which
threaten Our Religion, Our Liberty, Our Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, Our Commerce, and Our Po|&s;$erity.</P>
<P>In electing of Members to repre&s;ent you in Parliament, you give your hand to the
Securing or Betraying your Liberties, your Laws, your Con&s;titution, and your Na|tion.
You cannot but remember, Gentlemen, That before the Union, great Objecti|ons
were made again&s;t the Treaty, for that your Nation would be overpowered in a
<HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, Out-v$ted, and you$ L$berties in Danger, your Church and your
Con&s;titution be in danger of being &s;ubjected to the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t acq$$ e&s;ce with that Objection, if you Choo&s;e Men who will give you up to
$word$ Party in <HI>England</HI> that are for &s;ubjecting you&mdash;; But you are al&s;o to remember there
are in <HI>England</HI> a Party of Men P$$rons of Liberty, who neither will en&s;lave you, nor
be Slaves them&s;elves, who have twi&s;ted and incorporated your Liberties and their own,
$nd both with the Government and their Laws, that all will &s;tand and fall together.</P>
<P>If you choo&s;e Men that have a Sen&s;e of Liberty, a Sen&s;e of the Advantage of Laws,
and of a Government that adhere to them, and Governs by them, you will be &s;ecure
and they too; you will &s;trengthen the Hands of the Men of Truth, and enable them
to defend both you and them&s;elves: If you Ch$o&s;e Mercenarys, Enemies to the Go|vernment,
Men carele&s;s of their own Liberty, or of yours either, they will be drawn
in to join with a Party that will de&s;troy you, and you ruine both your &s;elves and your
$riends.</P>
<P>There are M$n that plea&s;e them&s;elves at railing at their Governours, and think all
Men Hone&s;t that complain of the Knav$ry of others; but this new Vi&s;o$ will detect
it &s;elf&mdash;. T$me was indeed, our Courts and $ut Kings have been our Betrayers and
Undoers; But whe$ Princes govern by Law, and abandon their Agents univer&s;ally to
Ju&s;tice, as the Queen intir$ly does, the Murmur at the Governours and the Mini&s;try,
mu&s;t be a State Trick to deceive the Innocent, and put the Face of a Patriot on the
M$$hinati$ns of a Tra$$$r.</P>
<P>All the Clamo$r at the Mini&s;try, and at Mi&s;management, have been effectually
&s;ilenced by this, where is the Man that has betrayed our Councils, neglected the pub|lick
Bu&s;ine&s;s, omitted his Duty, or mi&s;applyed the Trea&s;ure, Charge him in Parlia|ment,
and &s;ee if the Queen protects him?</P>
<P>Railing at the Court therefore, makes now no Patriot, and is no Rule to Judge by&mdash;.
But if you will choo&s;e Men to &s;erve you Hone&s;tly; let them be Men of tried Principles,
known Characters, and profes'd Concern for your Countreys L$berties&mdash;. Up&s;tarts&punc;
New Converts, Men come lately over, and perhaps hardly come over to Hone&s;t
Principles, Men known to you but by Recommendation, and perhaps but indifferent|ly
recommended either; the&s;e will never &s;ave <HI>Scotland</HI> from her pre&s;ent Dangers:
The Strife and Contention that now appears, has a Melancholly A&s;pect, and plainly
tells us the Gentlemen are pur&s;uing their Parties and their private Intere&s;ts, not the
Good of their Country; &s;uch are not likely to be Champions of <HI>Scotland</HI>'s Liberties, to
defend her again&s;t the inc$$achments of her Private Enemies, or to re&s;tore her Pro&s;pe|rity&mdash;:
And therefore while this Contention of Parties continues, I mu&s;t be excu&s;ed
to tell you very &s;eriou&s;ly, that <HI>Scotland</HI> is in manife&s;t Danger.</P>
