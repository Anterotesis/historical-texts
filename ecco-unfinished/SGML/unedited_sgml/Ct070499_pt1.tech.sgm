<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>In pre&s;enting to the Public a View of
Switzerland, a country of which &s;o much
has been already written, it may perhaps
become me to clear my&s;elf from the charge
of pre&s;umption. The de&s;criptive parts of
this journal were rapidly traced with the
ardor of a fond imagination, eager to &s;eize
the vivid colouring of the moment ere it
fled, and give permanence to the emotions
of admiration, while the &s;olemn enthu&s;ia&s;m
beat high in my bo&s;om; but when the &s;en|&s;ations
excited by tho&s;e views of maje&s;ti$
grandeur had &s;ub&s;ided, I recollected, with
regret, that the paths which I had delighted
<PB REF="4">
to tread had been trodden before; and that
the objects on which I had gazed with
a&s;toni&s;hment had been already de&s;cribed.
It is true, that the &s;ketch I have penciled of
that &s;ublime &s;cenery, however rude, will be
found to be an original drawing, copied
from nature, and not from books; yet I
&s;hould &s;carcely have pre&s;umed to obtrude
that unfini&s;hed outline on the public eye,
if the other parts of my journal offered no|thing
new to its ob&s;ervation. It is the pre|&s;ent
moral &s;ituation of Switzerland that ju&s;|tifies
the appearance of the&s;e volumes, in
which an attempt is made to trace the im|portant
effects which the French Revolution
has produced in that country, and which
are about to unfold a new aera in its hi&s;tory.
The governments of Switzerland, placed
within reach of the electrical fire of that
Revolution, fla&s;hing around all their bor|ders,
behold the &s;ubtle &s;park, which finds a
conductor in the human heart, e&s;caping be|yond
<PB REF="5">
its pre&s;cribed limits, and feel its &s;trong
concu&s;&s;ion in every agitated nerve.</P>
<P>I have endeavoured to give an additional
intere&s;t to my journal, by connecting the
view of the manners and cu&s;toms of the
Swi&s;s towns, with a comparative picture
of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of Paris; and I offer
this Work to the Public with far le&s;s hope
from the experience of its pa&s;t indulgence,
than &s;olicitude to obtain its future favor.</P>

<P>DURING the period of that new &s;pecies
of tryranny which a&s;&s;umed the name of revo|lutionary
government, I was not merely in|volved
in the common danger which threat|ened
every individual in France, but had
claims to particular pro&s;cription. It was not
only remembered by many of the &s;atellites of
Robe&s;pierre, that I had been the friend of the
<PB N="2" REF="13">
Gironde, of Madame Roland, martyred
names which it was death to pronounce,
but that I had written a work, publi&s;hed in
England, in which I had traced, without
re&s;erve, the characters of our oppre&s;&s;ors;
who&s;e ferocious purpo&s;es I had often heard
developed with the glowing eloquence of
Vergniaud, and the indignant energy of
La Source. No danger could be more im|minent
than that of living under the very
tyranny which I had the perilous honour
of having been one of the fir&s;t to deprecate,
and to proclaim.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation an opportunity pre&s;ented
it&s;elf of obtaining a pa&s;&s;port for Switzerland
&mdash;A pa&s;&s;port!&mdash;they who can judge of all
the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s that word unfolds, are not
tho&s;e who, at a &s;afe di&s;tance from the go|vernment
of Robe&s;pierre, have heard of its
terrific influence, but tho&s;e who were placed
within its &s;avage gra&s;p. Alas! at the mo|ment
<PB N="3" REF="14">
of my e&s;cape, how many, immured in
the dungeons of the tyrant, vainly wi&s;hed
to purcha&s;e, at the price of all they po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed,
the privilege of for&s;aking a country,
compo&s;ed only of executioners and of
victims!</P>
<P>The road from Paris to Ba&s;il leads for
the mo&s;t part along a level country, which
di&s;plays a picture of fertility, but few &s;cenes
of beauty or grandeur, except a branch of
the Vo&s;ges, which we traver&s;ed near Bel|fort,
and who&s;e &s;welling mountains, pre|&s;enting
faint traces of tho&s;e we were going
to contemplate, we &s;aw bounding our ho|rizon,
and &s;tretching along the plains of
Al&s;ace.</P>
<P>I found Ba&s;il crouded with &s;trangers of
all ranks, and all nations, being, at that
period, when general ho&s;tility had barred
the pa&s;&s;es from one country to another, al|mo&s;t
<PB N="4" REF="15">
the only &s;pot left open for the tran&s;|actions
of commerce, the a&s;ylum of the
fugitives, and the dawning negociations of
peace.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t view of Switzerland awakened
my enthu&s;ia&s;m mo&s;t powerfully&mdash;&startq;At
length,&endq; thought I, &startq;am I going to con|template
that intere&s;ting country, of which
I have never heard without emotion!&mdash;I
am going to gaze upon images of nature;
images of which the idea has &s;o often
&s;welled my imagination, but which my
eyes have never yet beheld.&mdash;I am going
to repo&s;e my wearied &s;pirit on tho&s;e &s;ublime
objects&mdash;to &s;ooth my de&s;ponding heart with
the hope that the moral di&s;order I have
witne&s;&s;ed &s;hall be rectified, while I gaze
on nature in all her admirable perfections;
and how delightful a tran&s;ition &s;hall I find
in the picture of &s;ocial happine&s;s which
Switzerland pre&s;ents! I &s;hall no longer &s;ee
<PB N="5" REF="16">
liberty profaned and violated; here &s;he
&s;miles upon the hills, and decorates the
vallies, and finds, in the uncorrupted &s;impli|city
of this people, a firmer barrier than in
the craggine&s;s of their rocks, or the &s;nows
of their Glaciers!&endq;</P>
<P>Such were my meditations when I fir&s;t
&s;et my foot on the &s;oil of Switzerland; the
&s;cenery of the country more than fulfilled
the glowing promi&s;e of imagination. With
re&s;pect to the character and manners of the
people, a re&s;idence of &s;everal weeks at Ba&s;il
&s;omewhat chilled my enthu&s;ia&s;m: I had
frequent opportunities of mixing in their
&s;ocieties, and di&s;cerned neither the love of
arts, of literature, of liberty, or of any
earthly good, but money&mdash;I heard of no|thing
but the comparative value of louis,
and a&s;&s;ignats; and if I had not &s;een the
Rhine rolling its turbulent waves maje&s;ti|cally
by the windows, I might have fan|cied
<PB N="6" REF="17">
my&s;elf in 'Change-alley, or the Perron
of the Palais Royal.</P>
<P>But if I was di&s;appointed, it was perhaps
my own fault, or rather the fault of former
travellers. Warmed with enthu&s;ia&s;m for
the natural beauties of the country, fancy,
which loves the dreams of happine&s;s and
perfection, has delighted to a&s;&s;ociate with
tho&s;e enchanting &s;cenes the charm of conge|nial
&s;ociety; and to connect with the &s;ub|lime
land&s;cape the higher qualities of mind.
Imagination places &s;tock-jobbers and u&s;urers
with as much reluctance amid&s;t the gran|deur
of Swi&s;s &s;cenery, as it would fill with
a mi&s;hapen Gothic image the niche of a
Grecian temple. It mu&s;t be indeed admit|ted,
that the love of gold is a ta&s;te pretty
generally diffu&s;ed throughout Europe; that
neither the inhabitants of Paris nor of Lon|don
can be taxed with any remarkable indif|ference
for riches; nor have wealthy per&s;ons
<PB N="7" REF="18">
in either of tho&s;e capitals any rea&s;on to
complain of the neglect of their fellow citi|zens.
But although the people of mo&s;t
countries are, with re&s;pect to the re&s;earches
of gain, burghers of Ba&s;il, during the hours
of the morning, the evening at lea&s;t is de|voted
to amu&s;ement, to &s;ocial plea&s;ure, to
friend&s;hip, to &s;ome object that cheers, or
&s;ooths the heart, and the projects of intere&s;t
are laid a&s;ide till the morrow. At Ba&s;il
alone, the toils of trade find no relaxation;
they begin with the day, but do not fini&s;h
at its clo&s;e; &s;ince even the hours of recrea|tion
are made &s;ub&s;ervient to the views of
intere&s;t; and the only &s;pecies of amu&s;e|ment
in which the burghers of that city in|dulge
them&s;elves, is one at which they
can arrange their commercial dealings, &s;trike
bargains, and vigorou&s;ly pur&s;ue that main
chance which appears to be, their &startq;being's
end, and aim.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="19">
With tho&s;e views, the men have formed
them&s;elves into different &s;ocieties, called
<HI>tabagies,</HI> or &s;moking-clubs, becau&s;e all the
members &s;moke mo&s;t furiou&s;ly. Each club
is compo&s;ed of nearly the &s;ame age, a cu&s;tom
to which the love of equality perhaps gave
ri&s;e, but which is ob&s;erved to be extremely
prejudicial to the manners of the young men
of Ba&s;il, by excluding all forms of deference
and politene&s;s, as well as all means of im|provement.
With re&s;pect to the&s;e things,
there is indeed nothing peculiar to the clubs
of Ba&s;il; &s;ince from Brooke's, compo&s;ed of
the honourable members of the Briti&s;h par|liament,
to the&s;e tabagies, filled with the
&s;enators of the laudable Helvetic Body, a
man who has long frequented &s;uch meetings
becomes entirely unfit for all other &s;ociety;
he &s;oon thinks it an hard&s;hip to pa&s;s an
evening el&s;ewhere, and terms all other
company con&s;traint, becau&s;e it wants the
$a&s;e of a tavern, where tumult is mi&s;taken
<PB N="9" REF="20">
for gaiety, and familiarity for friend&s;hip.
But while in other places the ta&s;te for clubs
is confined to a few per&s;ons, Ba&s;il is a
town of clubbi&s;ts, containing no le&s;s than
twelve &s;moking &s;ocieties, each compo&s;ed of
about &s;ixty members, who meet every af|ternoon
at an early hour, drink tea amid&s;t
the exhilarating fumes of tobacco, di&s;cu&s;s
the political &s;ituation, but far more indefa|tigable
the commercial affairs of the town,
calculate the gains and lo&s;&s;es of the day,
form new &s;chemes of acquiring wealth,
and &s;eparate at the hour of &s;upper before
they have &s;aid one word on any &s;ubject of
ta&s;te, or literature.</P>
<P>The ladies of Ba&s;il, abandoned by the
men, have recour&s;e to clubs al&s;o, and &s;ome|times
twenty ladies a&s;&s;emble together with|out
one man being of the party, although to
&s;uch as pre&s;ent them&s;elves, admittance, far
from being refu&s;ed, is even gratefully ac|corded;
<PB N="10" REF="21">
and &s;ometimes a &s;tranger taking
advantage of the po&s;ture of affairs at Ba&s;il,
which leads a coterie of young hand&s;ome
women to con&s;ider his company as a favour,
pays his homage to the ladies, while clouds
of other incen&s;e are ri&s;ing in every quarter
of the town from the tabagies where their
ab&s;ent hu&s;bands are convened.</P>
<P>The female &s;ocieties of Ba&s;il are formed
from infancy of children of the &s;ame age,
and of the &s;ame cla&s;s; and during their
childhood, the equality of years is &s;o &s;trictly
ob&s;erved in the&s;e &s;ocieties, that &s;i&s;ters, who&s;e
ages differ three or four years, have their
&s;eparate coteries in the &s;ame hou&s;e. There
is &s;omething &s;oothing in the idea of the&s;e
infant a&s;&s;ociations; it &s;eems forming ano|ther
barrier for our helple&s;s &s;ex, again&s;t the
future tempe&s;ts of the world; and no doubt
many a fair member of the&s;e young &s;ocie|ties,
when a&s;&s;ailed by tho&s;e &s;torms of mis|fortune,
<PB N="11" REF="22">
which often beat with the mo&s;t pi|tile&s;s
fury again&s;t hearts that can lea&s;t re&s;i&s;t
their violence, recalls with tender regret
the &s;ocial circle of her childhood; and per|haps
finds in the &s;ympathy of &s;ome female
companion, to whom &s;he is endeared by the
charm of tho&s;e early recollections, a &s;ource
of con&s;olation and relief. The young un|married
women, and the dowagers, have all
their di&s;tinct circles, &s;ometimes increa&s;ed by
the admi&s;&s;ion of &s;i&s;ters-in-law, who become
part of the family, and &s;ometimes by the
introduction of accidental acquaintances.</P>
<P>They a&s;&s;emble by invitation &s;ucce&s;&s;ively
at each other's hou&s;es, u&s;ually at three in the
afternoon; an hour which, though morn|ing
with re&s;pect to dinner, and all the bu&s;y
occupations of life at London and Paris,
finds the day far advanced at Ba&s;il; where
dinner is &s;erved, when it is noon, by the
clocks of that city, which, for &s;everal cen|turies
<PB N="12" REF="23">
pa&s;t, have kept the van-guard of
time, and for &s;ome rea&s;on, forgotten in the
lap&s;e of ages, probably becau&s;e not worth
being remembered, &s;trike twelve in defiance
of common &s;en&s;e and convenience, when the
&s;olar &s;hadow points eleven.</P>
<P>The ladies pre&s;ent them&s;elves at their co|teries
with their work-bags upon their arms,
and work and conver&s;ation begin together;
the latter turns, as in other unin&s;tructed
minds, upon the every-day go&s;&s;ip of ordi|nary
life. When the dome&s;tic detail of
hou&s;hold anecdote, and the tattle of town
&s;candal fail, they ha&s;ten to cards&mdash;what
other re&s;ource is left? Time cannot be filled
up, as it often is in mixed &s;ocieties, by the
flutter of coquetry, and the arts of affecta|tion
on one &s;ide, and by the offices of galan|try,
or the &s;tare of libertini&s;m on the other.</P>
<Q><L>&startq;Where none admire, 'tis u&s;ele&s;s to excel;</L>
<L>Where none are Beaux, 'tis vain to be a Belle.&endq;</L></Q>
<P><PB N="13" REF="24">
At the&s;e a&s;&s;emblies &s;he place of honor is
at the window, to which in every hou&s;e at
Ba&s;il convex mirrors are fixed, and give a
view of all that is pa&s;&s;ing the &s;treets to a
con&s;iderable di&s;tance. The&s;e mirrors, con|&s;ulted
every moment by the ladies of Ba&s;il,
not to view them&s;elves, but their neigh|bours,
would have furni&s;hed Thom&s;on, had
he lived in that city, with another image in
his ca&s;tle of indolence, of the means of mur|dering
time.</P>
<P>Tea is brought at four in the afternoon,
accompained by an hand&s;ome collation, con|&s;i&s;ting
of pa&s;try, fruits, creams, and &s;weet|meats,
and often of ham, and other cold
meats. This &s;ub&s;tantial kind of refre&s;h|ment
is not found unacceptable after a very
copious dinner, and with the per&s;pective of
a &s;olid &s;upper; the Swi&s;s in general being
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a mo&s;t powerful appetite, per|haps
ari&s;ing from the keenne&s;s of their
<PB N="14" REF="25">
mountain air. A dull game of commerce
drags on the lingering hours till eight in the
evening, when the ladies &s;eparate, after a
profu&s;ion of compliments, which they have

on the&s;e gala occa&s;ions, the card-party con|cludes

There is &s;omething re&s;pectable,
and even affecting in the&s;e patriarchal meet|ings;
they &s;eem a means of drawing clo&s;er
tho&s;e ties of con&s;anguinity which are the
be&s;t refuge again&s;t human ills; in which
the pure&s;t affections of the heart mingle
them&s;elves with the wants and weakne&s;s of
our nature; guiding with watchful tender|ne&s;s

<P>The public amu&s;ements of Ba&s;il were

an evil the more ea&s;ily to be
borne, as the town was then reaping an

abundant harve&s;t of gold from the calami|ties
of other countries. Once a week indeed,
the dulne&s;s of a card a&s;&s;embly was permitted
to replace that of the coteries; and an occa|&s;ional
concert harmonized the &s;oul; but
dancing was a diver&s;ion too light for the

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Comparative View of the Spirit of Commerce in France, be|fore,
and &s;ince the Revolution.&mdash;Paper Sy&s;tem.&mdash;Female
Traders and Contractors.</HEAD>
<P>IN France, a country &s;o near Switzerland
in its geographical &s;ituation, but &s;o di&s;t$$t
in the character and di&s;po&s;ition of the peo|ple,
things in this re&s;pect are managed bet|ter;
and although the French are lately be|come
in &s;ome &s;ort al&s;o a nation of u&s;urers
and &s;tock-jobbers, their mode of toiling for
wealth, and their mode of &s;pending it, are
altogether different from the plodding u&s;ages
of their neighbours.</P>
<P>The revolution which de&s;troyed monar|chy
in France, overthrew at the &s;ame time
the empire of ancient prejudices and habits.
Before that event, vanity was the govern|ing
&s;pring of French action, and the prin|cipal
aim, and aliment of that vanity, was
<PB N="18" REF="29">
rank and titles. A trader only laboured to
procure ju&s;t money enough to purcha&s;e a
charge of trea&s;urer of France, or <HI>&s;ecretaire
du roi,</HI> and when thus honourably ennobled,
con&s;idered it as beneath his dignity to con|tinue
any longer that commerce which had
&s;erved as the &s;tep-ladder to his elevation.</P>
<P>But the &s;cene is now rever&s;ed. Nobility
exi&s;ts no longer, and opinions have under|gone
as great a revolution as titles and for|tunes.
The poor are enriched; the rich
are impoveri&s;hed; labour is become nece&s;|&s;ary;
indu&s;try flouri&s;hes on the ruins of
vanity; and, as the impetuous French are
ever in extremes, their ancient di&s;dain of
mercantile occupations is &s;ucceeded by a
&s;ort of rage for commerce. To this new
fury they are animated, not only by the
call of nece&s;&s;ity, but by the de&s;ire of en|joyment.
This people, the ever ardent
lovers of plea&s;ure, pant to repair tho&s;e mo|ments
<PB N="19" REF="30">
of terror and de&s;olation which were lo&s;t
to their accu&s;tomed, their beloved gaieties.
They &s;eek amu&s;ement with new eager|ne&s;s,
and the dangers which they find at|tendant
on a revolution, only &s;erve to attach
them mote to the pre&s;ent moment, on the
Epicurean principle of uncertainty re&s;pect|ing
the future.</P>
<P>Immen&s;e commercial re&s;ources are found
in the fertility, the extent, the &s;ituation, and
the wants of the French Republic; but
nothing can be more amu&s;ing than the va|rious
whim&s;ical directions into which the
active, re&s;tle&s;s genius of the people, have
turned their pre&s;ent rage for traffic. All
gra&s;p at &s;omething &s;trange, and &s;omething
great; a new world &s;eems opening to their
view, and which all model after their own
fa&s;hion. Every man has &s;eized upon &s;ome
profound di&s;covery, &s;ome happy &s;pecula|tion,
which will infallibly pour forth an
<PB N="20" REF="31">
ever-flowing &s;tream of inexhau&s;tible wealth.
When one chimera fails, another &s;wiftly
&s;prings up; all is &startq;bubble, bubble, toil
and trouble;&endq; &s;purred by hope, or goaded
by want, every man mounts the hobby-hor&s;e
of his imagination, and whips it up
to &s;ome marvellous atchievement.</P>
<P>One citizen frames &s;toves of paper more
durable than bra&s;s or &s;teel; another erects
mills that &s;corn the aid of fire, wind, or
water; another extracts new chemical &s;ub|&s;tances,
which, when applied to commerce,
are to produce riches beyond the vi&s;ions of
the alchemi&s;ts. All announce that they
have &s;et their inventive talents upon the
anvil, merely for the good of their country;
and as the ideas which the revolution has
awakened, have given every individual in
France &s;ome floating notions of his own
importance, every man, however ignorant
or mi&s;taken, boldly brings forward his in|fallible
<PB N="21" REF="32">
plan, in&s;i&s;ts upon his right of
being heard by his fellow-citizens, and
calls upon every capitali&s;t to ha&s;ten to
him with his funds, and calculate, if he
can, the enormous ma&s;s of intere&s;t with
which the wings of every moment will be
loaded.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who decline &s;etting up as invent|ors,
and enlightening the world by di&s;co|veries,
although they refu&s;e to travel
through unknown tracts of commercial
enterprize, at lea&s;t engage in more beaten
paths of gain. Throughout the wide ex|tent
of the Republic, Gothic abbies are
transformed into manufactories, cloi&s;ters
become work-&s;hops, chapels are converted
into warehou&s;es, the rece&s;&s;es of &s;olitary
&s;uper&s;tition are invaded, and the hollow
echoes of the long-re&s;ounding ai&s;les, which
were once only re&s;pon&s;ive to the &s;olemn
&s;low-breathed chant, now repeat the rude
<PB N="22" REF="33">
di&s;&s;onance of the workman's tools. A
&s;trange confu&s;ion of images is excited in
the mind by the pre&s;ent contemplation of
the&s;e antique edifices, which imagination
has been accu&s;tomed to appropriate to con|genial
inhabitants, pacing &s;ilently along
their vaulted pa&s;&s;ages in floating garments,
in&s;tead of which you now meet the bare-armed,
brawny artificer, and all ideas of
&s;olemn &s;tillne&s;s vani&s;h amid&s;t the rude
gabble of his noi&s;y brood. No doubt an
arti&s;an is far more u&s;eful than a monk, but
he looks much le&s;s picture&s;que when placed
beneath a ruined arch, and gazed at in per|&s;pective.</P>
<P>While &s;peculators in the country are
converting abbies into manufactories, &s;pe|culators
in Paris are perhaps, on a &s;urer
principle of calculation, transforming palaces
into re&s;orts of public amu&s;ement, &s;o new,
&s;o various, and &s;o Grecian in all their plans
<PB N="23" REF="34">
and de&s;ignations, that to trace a &s;light &s;ketch
of them will require one of our whole fol|lowing
chapters.</P>
<P>The &s;y&s;tem of paper-money contributed
to cheri&s;h the new &s;pirit of &s;peculation in
France, by &s;uffering the imagination to rove
amid&s;t ideal regions of vi&s;ionary wealth.
The mo&s;t trifling purcha&s;e or tran&s;action,
at that period, had &s;omthing in it of &s;ound|ing
greatne&s;s; a pair of &s;hoes co&s;t a thou|&s;and
livres, an ell of ribband five hundred;
and as the women in France have even more
active &s;pirits than the men, every lady who
had fifty, or a hundred thou&s;and livres in
her pocket-book, con&s;idered her&s;elf as a
&s;ort of capitali&s;t; and hearing ince&s;&s;antly
from all parts, and in all directions, that
commerce was the infallible road to wealth,
immediately &s;et up with tho&s;e &s;olid funds
&s;ome &s;pecies of trade. One lady provided
<PB N="24" REF="35">
her&s;elf with a cargo of pocket handker|chiefs,
another with an a&s;&s;ortment of
&s;hoes; &s;ome &s;old tallow-candles, &s;ome
wax; &s;ome dealt in powder, and others
in &s;nuff; but all had their little traffic, all
were animated by the &s;ame re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirit of
gain. This &s;pecies of commerce, however,
was of fleeting duration. Sterne has ob|&s;erved,
that Frenchmen conceive, better than
they combine; &s;till more ju&s;tly may this
ob&s;ervation be applied to French women;
who, when they became adventurers in the
new world of traffic, exulted in the rapid
augmentation of their wealth; and were
a&s;toni&s;hed to find that the merchandize,
which was to replace the &s;tock, could no
longer be purcha&s;ed with the &s;ame capi|tal;
till at length they di&s;covered, that
their magnificent commercial profits were
a &s;ort of fairy-gold, which, when touch|ed,
turned to &s;and; and that it was not
<PB N="25" REF="36">
the merchandize which had increa&s;ed in
price, but the a&s;&s;ignats that had dimini&s;hed
in value.</P>
<P>A few of the mo&s;t beautiful, and the
mo&s;t intriguing of the fair Pari&s;ians, be|came
the agents and emi&s;&s;aries of their
friends, lovers, or hu&s;bands, in the public
offices; and the marine, the war, and the
home-departments, were filled with female
contractors and negociators, who, for the
mo&s;t part, found that republican committees
made no better defence than poli&s;hed courts,
again&s;t the formidable artillery of bright
eyes, gay &s;miles, lively &s;allies, and ani|mated
graces; artillery which French wo|men
know better how to wield, than the
women of any other country. Mini&s;ters
and commi&s;&s;aries felt the energy of argu|ments
uttered by ruby lips, and the claims
of a petition offered by a &s;oft hand, of
which the naked well-&s;haped arm was
<PB N="26" REF="37">
gracefully &s;tretched out; and, upon the
whole, the women of France, to whom,
by the Con&s;titutional Act, all rights have
been denied, find that they &s;till hold a to|lerably
de&s;potic empire over their lords and
ma&s;ters, the &s;overeign people.</P>
<P>Of a different cla&s;s from the&s;e female ne|gociators
and merchants, were tho&s;e women,
who, once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all that rank and for|tune
could be&s;tow, were now reduced to &s;up|ply
the pre&s;&s;ing wants of the moment, by a
melancholy &s;pecies of traffic; by &s;elling
various pieces of ornamental needle-work,
which they had once been taught to execute
as an amu&s;ement, or by making a profe&s;|&s;ion
of tho&s;e arts which they had once ac|quired
as the accompli&s;hments of an elegant
education. Above all, drawing has proved
an u&s;eful re&s;ource in the&s;e circum&s;tances.
Many a lady has found in her pencil, a
means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for her&s;elf and family;
<PB N="27" REF="38">
many a fini&s;hed land&s;cape, de&s;tined to grace
a cry&s;tal <HI>boudoir,</HI> or decorate a gilded pa|villion,
has &s;erved to furni&s;h the fair arti&s;t
with the cru&s;t of bread which, in &s;ome
lonely garret, &s;he moi&s;tens with her tears.

rituals.</P>
<P>During the la&s;t winter the amu&s;ements
of twenty-four theatres, which were opened
every night, were every night &s;ucceeded by
public and private balls, in &s;uch numbers,
that there were no le&s;s than two thou&s;and
ball-rooms in&s;cribed on the regi&s;ters of the

every &s;ort of amu&s;ement, in all their grada|tions,

oily lamp which lights up the &s;eventh &s;tory,
or the vaulted cellar, where the blind fidler's

to the cotillon of wooden &s;hoes.</P>
<P>The&s;e two thou&s;and ball-rooms of the
capital afford ample proof that no revolu|tion
has taken place in the manners of the
French, and that they are &s;till a dancing
nation. They have indeed of late fully de|mon&s;trated
to the world that they are capa|ble
of greater things; and that when the
energies of their &s;ouls are called forth, they
can follow Buonaparte acro&s;s the bridge of
Lodi; but when their minds return to their

The fetes of the court, it is a&s;&s;erted by
the few per&s;ons remaining in France, by
whom they were frequented, were but taw|dry
&s;plendour compared with the cla&s;&s;ical
elegance which prevails at the fetes of our
republican contractors. As a &s;pecimen of
the&s;e private balls, I &s;hall trace a &s;hort &s;ketch
of a dance lately given by one of the fur|ni&s;hers
of &s;tores for fleets and armies, in his
&s;pacious hotel, where all the furniture, in
compliance with the pre&s;ent fa&s;hion at Pa|ris,
is antique; where all that is not Greek
is Roman; where &s;tately &s;ilken beds, ma&s;&s;y
&s;ophas, worked tape&s;try, and gilt ornaments,
are thrown a&s;ide as rude Gothic magnifi|cence,
and every couch re&s;embles that of
Pericles, every chair tho&s;e of Cicero; where
every wall is fini&s;hed in arabe&s;que, like the
baths of Titus, and every table, upheld by
Ca&s;tors and Polluxes, is covered with Athe|nian
bu&s;ts and Etru&s;can va&s;es; where
that modern piece of furniture a clock is
<PB N="31" REF="42">
concealed beneath the cla&s;&s;ic bar of Phoebus,
and the dancing hours; and every chim|ney-iron
is &s;upported by a Sphinx, or a
Griffin. The dre&s;s of his female vi&s;itors
was in perfect harmony with the furniture
of his hotel; for although the Pari&s;ian
ladies are not &s;u&s;pected of any ob&s;tinate at|tachment
to Grecian modes of government,
they are mo&s;t rigid partizans of Grecian
modes of dre&s;s, adorned like the contem|poraries
of A&s;pa&s;ia&mdash;the loo&s;e light drapery,
the naked arm, the bare bo&s;om, the &s;andaled

the twi&s;ting tre&s;&s;es, all di&s;play the mo&s;t in|flexible

of Paris, in order to accommodate
him&s;elf to the cla&s;&s;ical ta&s;te of his fair cu&s;|tomers,
is provided with a variety of an|tique

<P>The fair Grecians being determined not
to injure the contour of fine forms by &s;u|perfluous
incumbrances, no fa&s;hionable
lady at Paris wears any pockets, and the
inconvenience of being without is obviated
by &s;ticking her fan in her belt, &s;liding in a
flat pur&s;e of morocco leather, only large
enough to contain a few louis, at the &s;ide of
her neck, and giving her &s;nuff-box and her
pocket-handkerchief to the care of the gen|tleman
who attends her, and to whom &s;he
applies for them whenever &s;he has occa|&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="44">
For a &s;hort time during the winter, in
defiance of fro&s;t and &s;now, the co&s;tume of
a few reigning belles was not <HI>&agrave; la grec,</HI> but
<HI>&agrave; la &s;auvage.</HI> To be dre&s;&s;ed <HI>&agrave; la &s;auvage,</HI>
was to have all that part of the frame which
was not left uncovered clad in a light dra|pery
of fle&s;h colour. The boddice under
which no linen was worn (&s;hifts being an
article of dre&s;s long &s;ince rejected at Paris,
both by the Greeks and the Savages) the
boddice was made of knitted &s;ilk, clinging
exactly to the &s;hape, which it perfectly di&s;|played;
the petticoat was on one &s;ide
twi&s;ted up by a light fe&s;toon; and the feet,
which were either bare or covered with a
&s;ilk &s;tocking of fle&s;h colour, &s;o woven as to
draw upon the toes like a glove upon the
fingers, were decorated with diamonds.
The&s;e gentle &s;avages, however, found them|&s;elves
&s;o rudely treated whenever they ap|peared,
by the &s;overeign multitude, that at
length the fa&s;hions of Otaheite were thrown
<PB N="34" REF="45">
a&s;ide, and Greece remains the &s;tanding order
of the day.</P>
<P>But to return to the contractor, and his

cotillons, which the young women of
Paris perform with a degree of perfection&mdash;
a light nymphi&s;h grace un&s;een el&s;ewhere&mdash;
and after the wal&s;e, which is now never
forgotten at a Paris ball, had proved that
the &s;teady heads of Niob&eacute;s were not to be
made giddy, the company were led to a
&s;upper furni&s;hed with Ea&s;tern magnificence,
and decorated with attic ta&s;te. After &s;up|per
the folding doors of the &s;aloon were
thrown open to a garden of con&s;iderable ex|tent,
beautifully illuminated with coloured
lamps, and its trees bending with lavi&s;h
clu&s;ters of fruits of every &s;ea&s;on, and every
climate, formed of ice, while fountains
poured forth &s;treams of orgeat, lemonade,

But while the&s;e imitators of Greece and
Rome are revelling in A&s;iatic luxury, you
hear them lamenting mo&s;t pathetically the
&s;ubver&s;ion of the ancient regime; that re|gime,
which would at lea&s;t have had thus
much of ju&s;tice, that it would have retained
the&s;e per&s;onages in the anti-chambers of the
&s;aloons they now occupy; to which anti|chambers
they would with a counter-revo|lution
mo&s;t probably return. One is obliged
to offer up an invocation to patience, when
condemned to li&s;ten to their declamations
again&s;t that new order of things to which
&s;olely they owe their elevation.</P>
<P>There is indeed one cla&s;s of per&s;ons, be|fore
who&s;e complaints of the revolution,
however bitter, the mind humbles it&s;elf in
&s;ympathetic &s;orrow. The poor <HI>rentier,</HI>

which he is forced to procure by parting, in
&s;ad gradation, with all the relicks of his
<PB N="36" REF="47">

furniture, and clothes: he indeed, if he com|plains,
is to be pitied, and if he forbears
complaint, is to be revered! But alas, there
is &s;o much of tragical detail in the pages of
the <HI>great book;</HI> a thing which has long
&s;ince been called a great evil, that we mu&s;t
give it at lea&s;t a whole chapter to it&s;elf.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that the
reign of terror has acted upon this country
like &s;ome mighty pe&s;tilence, which not only
&s;weeps away devoted millions in its fury,
but leaves an obnoxious taint upon every
object where it has pa&s;&s;ed. The reign of
terror has given a fatal wound to the ener|gies
of public &s;pirit; ordinary minds have
mi&s;taken the execrable abu&s;es of liberty for
an effect of the generous principle it&s;elf:
the victims of revolutionary government
have lifted up their complaining voice; all
the emotions of &s;ympathy, and all the feel|ings
<PB N="37" REF="48">
of indignation have been called forth;
and the partizans of the ancient regime have
left no art unpracti&s;ed, no &s;eduction un|tried,
to take advantage of the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions
in favor of their own &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have been too rapidly enrich|ed

the ob&s;curity of their origin, by mimicking
the tones of tho&s;e who have titles and honors
to regret, till ari&s;tocracy has de&s;cended &s;o

<P>THROUGH what a delicious country we
pa&s;&s;ed in travelling along the Canton of
Ba&s;il to that of Soleure! What beautiful,
what various combinations of rock, pine|clad
hills thrown together in noble ma&s;&s;es,
and richly covered with their dark-tinted
verdure; above which a bare peak &s;ome|times
lifts its &s;harp &s;piral head, as if to
give effect to the land&s;cape.</P>
<P>What grateful &s;ounds to my ear were the
murmurs of tho&s;e &s;oothing ca&s;cades, and
clear rills which had more of beauty than
<PB N="49" REF="64">
&s;ublimity, but which filled my heart with
emotion, while I con&s;idered them as the
prelude of &s;cenes, where the water-fall &s;wells
into a torrent, and where, in&s;tead of rapid
brooks, and &s;mall &s;treams, the borad lake
&s;preads its maje&s;tic expan&s;e of waters.</P>
<P>I was yet only in the ve&s;tibule of Swit|zerland,
and nature appeared to me as if
lifting up gradually the veil which con|cealed
tho&s;e mighty objects of overwhelm|ing
grandeur, which my imagination &s;prung
forward to meet with enthu&s;ia&s;tic rapture.
We pa&s;&s;ed by &s;everal country hou&s;es, with
plea&s;ure-grounds covered with verdant &s;eats,
bowers, and arbours, profanely cut into all
the mi&s;hapen forms of Gothic fury, and
where literally,
<Q><L>&startq;Grove nods at grove, each alley has a brother,</L>
<L>And half the platform ju&s;ts reflects the other.&endq;</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="65">
One might forgive a Dutchman for clip|ping
his trees, and &s;quaring his walks by
the &s;ame rule with which he cuts his ca|nals,
and digs his ditches; but here, in the
very temple of nature, where the inhabitant
has but to ca&s;t his eye around him in order
to learn all that &s;he can teach of grace and
maje&s;ty, it &s;eems difficult to avoid feeling,
that <HI>jets-d' eaux</HI> are but ludicrous mimickry
in the neighbourhood of cataracts, that
bouquets of yew, and pillars of fir, lo&s;e
much of their effect when placed beneath
hanging woods of pines, and columns of
cliffs, and that the romantic hills above are
an eternal &s;atire on the trim walks below.</P>
<P>In our way to Schaffhau&s;en, we &s;pent
&s;ome agreeable days with a &s;mall party, at
a farm-hou&s;e in the Canton of Ba&s;il, &s;ituated
in the nook of a mountain. High hills
ri&s;e &s;loping round this little white dwell|ing,
covered with fine pa&s;turage, and &s;cat|tered
<PB N="51" REF="66">
over with trees, woody cop&s;es, and
&s;wift rivulets flowing down their green
&s;ides. An Iri&s;h gentleman, who had hired
apartments in this habitation for the &s;um|mer,
and whom we went to vi&s;it, had cut
winding paths along the &s;teep hills with his
own hands, directed the fre&s;h &s;prings to
flow into cool baths, and placed Italian,
Latin, and French in&s;criptions upon the
trees, in the charming rece&s;&s;es of the hang|ing
woods.</P>
<P>When our good farmer bought his
ground, its appendages of woods, cliffs,
and rills, had probably only entered into his
&s;peculations, &s;o far as they were the means
or the impediments of culture; but an
Engli&s;h nobleman would have purcha&s;ed
them with half his fortune. During our
&s;tay in this beautiful retreat we, lived with
the farmer and his family, eat of their
<PB N="52" REF="67">
bread, drank of their cup, and found per|fect
neatne&s;s, as well as plentiful ho&s;pita|lity
at their table.</P>
<P>The farmer, a plain, hone&s;t, &s;en&s;ible
Swi&s;s, was proud of his country, and above
all, proud of his privileges, as he happened
to be a burgher of Ba&s;il. He produced a
kind of placard, which had been in his fa|mily,
he &s;aid, for ages; and we ob&s;erved
that the date was in the middle of the
fifteenth century. On this large placard
was not ill engraven all the memorable hi&s;|torical
events of Switzerland, &s;ince it began
its &s;truggles for freedom, with poetry below,
explaining more fully the atchievements
which the painting related above. Our far|mer
felt his &s;oul animated, and him&s;elf
half a warrior, while he gazed on the&s;e
glorious triumphs of his ance&s;tors. I was,
perhaps, the more &s;truck with his enthu|&s;ia&s;m,
<PB N="53" REF="68">
becau&s;e it was the fir&s;t time I had
ob&s;erved any &s;uch &s;entiment &s;ince my arri|val
in Switzerland.</P>
<P>In the commercial parts of that country,
this feeling of pride in the feats of their
progenitors is as completely extinct as the
heroic race it&s;elf, which is long &s;ince gone
to the family-vault of all the Capulets; but
in the little or ancient Cantons which were
the cradle of Swi&s;s liberty, this generous
&s;entiment is &s;till cheri&s;hed. The pea&s;ants
teach their children the oral tale of other
times, and they early imbibe with the love
of their own country an inveterate hatred
again&s;t Au&s;tria. The memory of tho&s;e va|lorous
deeds is al&s;o impre&s;&s;ed on the mind
by coar&s;e paintings, which cover the walls
of the pea&s;ants' hou&s;es, and are &s;ometimes
&s;o large as narrowly to e&s;cape the fate of
the Vicar of Wakefield's family picture.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="69">
The farmer al&s;o recounted to me &s;ome
of the ru&s;tic &s;olemnities which are practi&s;ed
in the Canton of Ba&s;il, where the pea&s;ants
crown with heaps of flowers the hive
which produces the fir&s;t &s;warm of bees;
and when the cows fir&s;t go to gra&s;s in the
&s;pring, and leave it in the autumn, a long
proce&s;&s;ion is formed of two cows abrea&s;t,
who&s;e horns are gayly decorated for the
gala, aud who are led on by two white
cows mo&s;t profu&s;ely covered with wreaths,
and ribbands of various colours. This
cu&s;tom, I am told, is as ancient as the days
of Theocritus, who talks of adorning his
favorite cow with chaplets.</P>
<P>Many a traditionary tale gives a moral in|tere&s;t
to the picture&s;que &s;cenes of this en|chanting
country. In one of our airings
on hor&s;eback, during our &s;tay at the farm|hou&s;e,
we pa&s;&s;ed through a defile, above
which ro&s;e piles of cliffs five hundred feet
<PB N="55" REF="70">
high, and on the brow of one tho&s;e tower|ing
craggs we di&s;cerned the ruins of a Go|thic
ca&s;tle, two windows of which &s;till re|main.
&startq;There,&endq; &s;aid our guide, point|ing
to the frowning &s;ummit of the rock,
&startq;&s;ome ages pa&s;t lived a tyrant: he de|lighted
in de&s;olation and death, and when|ever
any of his va&s;&s;als offended him, he or|dered
them to appear before him, and then
cau&s;ed the unhappy victims to be thrown
headlong from yonder horrible precipice
into this gulph below. Three centuries
&s;ince his va&s;&s;als had their revenge; they
armed them&s;elves, climbed up at night by
almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible paths to the ca&s;tle, which
they &s;urprized, and &s;et on fire, and the
tyrant peri&s;hed in the flames.&endq;</P>
<P>We left, with regret, the farmer's white
dwelling, and cro&s;&s;ing a part of the chain
of Jura, proceeded on our journey to Ba|den,
which is the Bath of Switzerland,
<PB N="56" REF="71">
celebrated for the virtues of its hot &s;prings,
and is much frequented in &s;ummer; but
there are no public meetings, and the com|pany
a&s;&s;ociate little together. The town is
&s;urrounded by lofty green hills; and the
Limat flows at their feet with an impetu|ous
rapidity, which &s;eems to realize the
poetical idea of living waters. We walked
along a narrow path along the edge of the
river to a limpid fountain, where the
country girls, dre&s;&s;ed in the picture&s;que
co&s;tume of the female Swi&s;s pea&s;antry,
came to draw water, and gave a more
pa&s;toral air to the &s;cene. Bidding farewel
to Badeu, where we had been received by
Mr. Barthelemy, the French Amba&s;&s;ador,
with elegant ho&s;pitality, we pur&s;ued our
cour&s;e to Zuric.</P>
<P>This neat, and chearful town, is divided
into two parts by the Limat, and delight|fully
&s;ituated on the northern extremity of
<PB N="57" REF="72">
its noble lake, which &s;preads, far as the
eye can reach, its ma&s;s of limped waters,
bounded by vine-covered hills, who&s;e &s;lopes
are thick-&s;tudded with hou&s;es and villages;
while beyond this &s;cene of picture&s;que
beauty, the Alps, covered with their eter|nal
&s;nows, ri&s;e in the di&s;tant per&s;pective,
&s;tretching towards the &s;outh-we&s;t, and
mingling their &s;ummits with the clouds.
It was not without the mo&s;t powerful emo|tion
that, for the fir&s;t time, I ca&s;t my eyes
on that &s;olemn, that maje&s;tic vi&s;ion, the
Alps!&mdash;how often had the idea of tho&s;e
&s;tupendous mountains filled my heart with
enthu&s;ia&s;tic awe!&mdash;&s;o long, &s;o eagerly, had
I de&s;ired to contemplate that &s;cene of won|ders,
that I was unable to trace when fir&s;t
the wi&s;h was awakened in my bo&s;om&mdash;it
&s;eemed from childhood to have made a part
of my exi&s;tence&mdash;I longed to bid adieu to
the gayly-peopled land&s;capes of Zuric, and
wander amid&s;t tho&s;e regions of my&s;terious
<PB N="58" REF="73">
&s;ublimity, the &s;olitudes of nature, where her
eternal laws &s;eem at all &s;ea&s;ons to forbid
more than the temporary vi&s;its of man, and
where, &s;ometimes, the dangerous pa&s;&s;es to
her frozen &s;ummits are inflexibly barred
again&s;t mortal foot&s;teps. The plea&s;ure ari&s;|ing
from the varying forms of &s;miling beauty
with which we were &s;urrounded, became a
cold &s;en&s;ation, while expectation hung upon
tho&s;e va&s;t gigantic &s;hapes, that half-&s;een
chaos which excited the &s;tronger feelings of
wonder, mingled with admiration. But I was
obliged, with whatever regret, to relinqui&s;h
for the pre&s;ent a nearer view of tho&s;e tre|mendous
objects, &s;ince private affairs left
me only &s;ufficient lei&s;ure to vi&s;it the cataract
of the Rhine before I returned to Ba&s;il;
whence, however, I &s;oothed my&s;elf with
the hope of being &s;oon able to depart
in &s;earch of the terrific &s;cenes of the Alps,
and the rich luxuriant graces of the Italian
vallies of Switzerland. In the mean time
<PB N="59" REF="74">
we pa&s;&s;ed ha&s;tily through Zuric, in our way
to Schaffhau&s;en, for although I had been
a&s;&s;ured that the cataract of the Rhine was
&startq;but a fall of water,&endq; it had excited &s;o
tormenting a curio&s;ity, that I found I &s;hould
be incapable of &s;eeing any thing el&s;e with
plea&s;ure or advantage, till I had once gazed
upon that object.</P>
<P>When we reached the &s;ummit of the hill
which leads to the fall of the Rhine, we
alighted from the carriage, and walked
down the &s;teep bank, whence I &s;aw the
river rolling turbulently over its bed of
rocks, and heard the noi&s;e of the torrent, to|wards
which we were de&s;cending, increa&s;|ing
as we drew near. My heart &s;welled
with expectation&mdash;our path, as if formed
to give the &s;cene its full effect, concealed for

reached a wooden balcony, projecting on
the edge of the water, and whence, ju&s;t

&s;heltered from the torrent, it bur&s;ts in all
its overwhelming wonders on the a&s;toni&s;h|ed

with wild impetuo&s;ity over tho&s;e
broken, unequal rocks, which, lifting up
their &s;harp points amid&s;t its &s;ea of foam,
di&s;turb its headlong cour&s;e, multiply its

a new a&s;pect&mdash;that &s;pray ri&s;ing into
clouds of vapour, and reflecting the pri&s;|matic
colours, while it di&s;per&s;es it&s;elf over
the hills&mdash;never, never can I forget the &s;en|&s;ations
of that moment! when with a &s;ort
of annihilation of &s;elf, with every pa&s;t im|pre&s;&s;ion
era&s;ed from my memory, I felt as
if my heart were bur&s;ting with emotions
too &s;trong to be &s;u&s;tained.&mdash;Oh, maje&s;tic
torrent! which ha&s;t conveyed a new image
of nature to my &s;oul, the moments I have
<PB N="61" REF="76">
pa&s;&s;ed in contemplating thy &s;ublimity will
form an epocha in my &s;hort &s;pan!&mdash;thy
cour&s;e is coeval with time, and thou wilt
ru&s;h down thy rocky walls when this bo|&s;om,
which throbs with admiration of thy
greatne&s;s, &s;hall beat no longer!</P>
<P>What an effort does it require to leave,
after a tran&s;ient glimp&s;e, a &s;cene on which,
while we meditate, we can take no account
of time! its narrow limits &s;eem too confined
for the expanded &s;pirit; &s;uch objects appear
to belong to immortality; they call the
mu&s;ing mind from all its little cares and
vanities, to higher de&s;tinies and regions,
more congenial than this world to the feel|ings
they excite. I had been often &s;um|moned
by my fellow-travellers to depart,
had often repeated &startq;but one moment
more,&endq; and many &startq;moments more&endq; had
elap&s;ed, before I could re&s;olve to tear my|&s;elf
from the balcony.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="77">
We cro&s;&s;ed the river, below the fall, in a
boat, and had lei&s;ure to ob&s;erve the &s;ur|rounding
&s;cenery. The cataract, however,
had for me a &s;ort of fa&s;cinating power,
which, if I withdrew my eyes for a mo|ment,
again fa&s;tened them on its impetuous
waters. In the back-ground of the torrent
a bare mountain lifts its head encircled with
its blue vapours; on the right ri&s;es a &s;teep
cliff, of an enormous height, covered with
wood, and upon its &s;ummit &s;tands the
Ca&s;tle of Lauffen, with its frowning towers,
and encircled with its crannied wall; on
the left, human indu&s;try has &s;eized upon a
&s;lender thread of this mighty torrent in its
fall, and made it &s;ub&s;ervient to the purpo&s;es
of commerce. Founderies, mills, and
wheels, are erected on the edge of the
river, and a portion of the va&s;t ba&s;on into
which the cataract falls is confined by a
dyke, which pre&s;erves the warehou&s;es and
the neighbouring huts from its inundations.

Sheltered within this little nook, and ac|cu&s;tomed

thundering &s;ounds which &s;eem calculated to
&s;u&s;pend all human activity in &s;olemn and
awful a&s;toni&s;hment; while the imagina|tion

uncontrolable grandeur<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Cox e&s;timates the height of the cataract of the Rhine at only fifty feet; Mon&s;. Ramond, his ele|gant French tran&s;lator, adds the following note to this ob&s;ervation:&mdash;&startq; The quantity of water, which varies according to the &s;ea&s;on, has &s;ome influence upon the height, and a con&s;iderable effect upon the a&s;pects of this fall. Tho&s;e who have &s;een it at the period when the &s;nows di&s;&s;olve, will admit that de&s;cription to be exact which Mr. Cox thinks exaggerated, and only true of remote times. I have been a&s;&s;ured that the height of the cataract, in the&s;e circum&s;tances, is not le&s;s than eighty feet. A &s;tranger can &s;carcely, with|out temerity, judge from his &s;imple ob&s;ervation, and if he does &s;o, he will be &s;ure to be below the truth. I have a&s;certained, and Mr. Cox him&s;elf makes the &s;ame remark, that it requires the eye of a Swi&s;s to judge of certain dimen&s;ions, which, exceeding all we have before &s;een, find no model of proportion in the mind. Tho&s;e who have travelled for the fir&s;t time in Switzerland, have often found, to their great &s;urpri&s;e, that in&s;tead of exaggerating the heights and the di&s;|tances, they have dimini&s;hed them one-half, or two-thirds, till long habit taught them to expand their ideas, by furni&s;hing them with fit objects of compa|ri&s;on.&endq;</NOTE>.</P>

of our Fathers.&mdash;Fa&s;hionable Devotees.&mdash;La Harpe.
&mdash;Lectures on Religion at Idalia.&mdash;De&s;ertion of the
Pro&s;elytes.&mdash;Theophilanthropi&s;m.</HEAD>
<P>WE &s;taid long enough at Zuric to vi&s;it
its fir&s;t literary ornament Lavater. It be|ing
known that he is willing to receive
&s;trangers, no traveller of any lettered curio|&s;ity
pa&s;&s;es through the town, without pay|ing
him the homage of a vi&s;it.</P>
<P>He received us in his library, which was
hung thick with portraits and engravings,
of which he has a con&s;iderable collection,
forming a complete &s;tudy of the ever vary|ing
expre&s;&s;ion of the human face divine.
Some very wi&s;e men, who admit of no
&s;cope to that faculty of the mind called
imagination, and are for ever bringing
<PB N="67" REF="86">
every theory to the &s;quare, and the com|pa&s;s,
con&s;ider his &s;y&s;tem of phy&s;iognomy as
the fanta&s;tic vi&s;ion of an heated brain; but
though it may be difficult, it is &s;urely inge|nious
and intere&s;ting to attempt reducing to
rules a &s;cience, which &s;eems to be founded
in nature. It is &s;urely curious to analy&s;e
what it is &s;o ea&s;y to feel, the charm of that
expre&s;&s;ion, which is the emanation of mo|ral
qualities; that undefinable grace which
is not beauty, but &s;omething more; with|out
which its enchantments lo&s;e their power
of fa&s;cination, and which can &s;hed an ani|mated
glow, a &s;park of divinity over the
features of deformity:
<Q><L>&startq;Mind, mind alone, bear witne&s;s earth, and heaven,</L>
<L>The living fountain in it&s;elf contains</L>
<L>Of beauteous and &s;ublime.&endq;</L></Q></P>
<P>Lavater is a venerable looking old man,
with a &s;harp long face, high features, and
a wrinkled brow: he is tall, thin, and
<PB N="68" REF="87">
intere&s;ting in his figure; when &s;erious he
has a look of melancholy, almo&s;t of in|quietude;
but when he &s;miles, his coun|tenance
becomes lighted up with an ex|pre&s;&s;ion
of &s;weetne&s;s and intelligence.</P>
<P>There is a &s;imple eloquence in his con|ver&s;ation,
an effu&s;ion of the heart extreme|ly
attractive: he &s;peaks French with &s;ome
difficulty, and whenever he is at a lo&s;s for
an expre&s;&s;ion has recour&s;e to German, which
I in vain begged a Swi&s;s gentleman, who
was of our party, to tran&s;late for me: he
told me that for the mo&s;t part the German
words Lavater employed were compound-epithets
of his own framing, which had pe|culiar
energy as he u&s;ed them, but which
would be quite vapid and &s;piritle&s;s in tran&s;|lation.</P>
<P>The great rule of moral conduct, Lava|ter
&s;aid, in his opinion, was, next to God, to
<PB N="69" REF="88">
re&s;pect time. Time, he con&s;idered as the mo&s;t
valuable of human trea&s;ures, and any wa&s;te
of it as in the highe&s;t degree immoral. He
ri&s;es every morning at the hour of five; and
though it would be agreeable to him to
breakfa&s;t immediately after ri&s;ing, makes it
an invariable rule to earn that repa&s;t by
&s;ome previous labour; &s;o that if by acci|dent
the re&s;t of the day is &s;pent to no u&s;e|ful
purpo&s;e, &s;ome portion of it may at
lea&s;t be &s;ecured beyond the interruptions of
chance.</P>
<P>Lavater gave us a mo&s;t plea&s;ing account
of morals in Zuric. He had been a
preacher of the go&s;pel, he &s;aid, in that town
thirty years; and &s;o incapable were the
citizens of any &s;pecies of corruption, that
he &s;hould have rendered him&s;elf ridiculous
had he ever during that long period preach|ed
a &s;ermon again&s;t it, &s;ince it was a
vice unknown. &startq;At what a di&s;tance,&endq;
<PB N="70" REF="89">
thought I, &startq;am I arrived from London
and Paris.&endq;</P>
<P>When we took our leave of Lavater, he
begged we would write our names and
place of abode in a book, which he appro|priates
to the u&s;e of in&s;cribing the long li&s;t
of his foreign vi&s;itors. An hour after my
return from his hou&s;e he came to pay me a
vi&s;it, which I was taught to con&s;ider as an
unu&s;ual compliment, &s;ince it is his general
rule not to return the vi&s;its of &s;trangers.
Religion was the theme of his di&s;cour&s;e,
and he talked of its plea&s;ures, its con&s;ola|tions,
and its hopes, with a &s;olemn &s;ort of
enthu&s;ia&s;tic fervor, which &s;hewed how
much his heart was intere&s;ted in the &s;ub|ject,
and how warmly his &s;en&s;ibility was
awake to devotional feelings. Although
his zeal was not without knowledge, yet it
was &s;omewhat difficult to di&s;cover what was
his &s;y&s;tem of belief: whether he was of
<PB N="71" REF="90">
Paul or Apollos, a follower of Calvin ac|cording
to the e&s;tabli&s;hed creed of the Swi&s;s
church, or whether he was not in &s;ome &s;ort
the framer of a new doctrine him&s;elf.</P>
<P>One of my fellow-travellers, who was
anxious to wre&s;t from the venerable pa&s;tor
his confe&s;&s;ion of faith, brought in review
before him the various opinions of the fa|thers,
orthodox and heretic; from Ju&s;tin
Martyr and Origin, down to the Bi&s;hop of
St. David's and Dr. Prie&s;tley. But La|vater
did not appear to have made polemics
his &s;tudy; he &s;eemed to think right and
wrong, in hi&s;torical fact, of far le&s;s im|portance
than right and wrong in religious
&s;entiment; and above all, in human action.
There was more of feeling than of logic in
his conclu&s;ions; and he appeared to have
taken le&s;s pains to examine religion, than
to apply its precepts to the regulation of
tho&s;e frailties and pa&s;&s;ions of the human
<PB N="72" REF="91">
heart, the traces of which, hidden fro$
others, he had marked with &s;uch admira|ble
accuracy in the character and expre&s;&s;ion
of outward forms. For my&s;elf, I own the
&s;olemn, meek, affectionate expre&s;&s;ion of
Lavater's pious &s;entiments, were peculiarly
&s;oothing to my feelings, after having been
&s;o long &s;tunned with the cavils of French
philo&s;ophers, or rather the impertinent
comments of their di&s;ciples, who are &s;o
proud of their &s;ceptici&s;m, that they are for
ever obtruding it in conver&s;ation. The
number of tho&s;e di&s;ciples is augmented
&s;ince the revolution, which has &s;pread far
and wide the writings of Rou&s;&s;eau and
Voltaire; and every Frenchman, after hav|ing
read tho&s;e authors, though he may nei|ther
have ta&s;te enough to admire the charms
of their genius, or virtue to feel the phi|lanthropy
of their &s;entiments, has, at lea&s;t,
acquired &s;ufficient knowledge to a&s;&s;ume the
appellation of philo&s;opher, and prove his
<PB N="73" REF="92">
claim to that title by enli&s;ting him&s;elf under
the banner of infidelity, without knowing
the u&s;e of his arms.</P>
<P>This irreverence for religion, however,
which Mr. Burke con&s;idered as one of the
primary cau&s;es of the French Revolution,
is not, as heretofore, the ton among&s;t per|&s;ons
of former rank and fa&s;hion; infidelity
has been in di&s;grace with that cla&s;s, ever
&s;ince it was profaned by the vulgar Jacobin
touch; and the only di&s;tingui&s;hed trophies
that &s;y&s;tem can now boa&s;t, are a few Anti-Newtonian
flights with re&s;pect to final
cau&s;es, from a&s;tronomic infidels. The
ari&s;tocracy were no &s;ooner convinced that
the Catholic e&s;tabli&s;hment, and above all,
the non-juring prie&s;ts were their be&s;t auxi|liaries,
than all the elegant women of Paris
became immediately devot&eacute;es, and nothing
was heard of in fa&s;hionable &s;aloons but
profe&s;&s;ions of attachment and re&s;pect <HI>&startq;pour
<PB N="74" REF="93">
la religion de nos peres;</HI>&endq; by which it was
well under&s;tood that &startq;more was meant
than met the ear,&endq; and that the&s;e &s;entiments
included the government, as well as the
creed of their fathers.</P>
<P>The great director of the con&s;ciences of
the&s;e fair converts, dre&s;t <HI>&agrave; la P&s;yche,</HI> was
Mon&s;. de la Harpe, a literary man of con|&s;iderable
infidel reputation under the old
regime; the di&s;ciple and friend of Vol|taire,
d'Alembert, Diderot, and other emi|nent
encyclypodi&s;ts, and in &s;ome &s;ort a
leader of the &s;ect after their decea&s;e, or, ac|cording
to their own creed, after their an|nihilation.
The Gamaliel of Mon&s;. La
Harpe, was Madame C&mdash;T&mdash;; it
was at her feet, in the gloom of a pri&s;on,
during the terrific tyranny of the Jacobins,
that this philo&s;opher was brought to the
knowledge and belief of Chri&s;tianity. I
have before ob&s;erved, that the noble&s;t ex|amples
<PB N="75" REF="94">
of fortitude and re&s;ignation under
&s;ufferings were, during revolutionary go|vernment,
di&s;played by women. It was,
no doubt, in the calmne&s;s and imperturba|bility
of Madame C&mdash;T&mdash;'s$ mind,
under the certain expectation of the &s;caffold,
that Mon&s;. La Harpe was fir&s;t led to ad|mire
the effects of a per&s;ua&s;ion, which her
eloquence and his own conviction made
him afterwards adopt; and of which he
became, in defiance of all his former opi|nions,
the zealous and fa&s;hionable advo|cate.</P>
<P>The cruel per&s;ecution which the Catholic
religion had &s;u&s;tained from the intolerant
Jacobins, had produced the u&s;ual effect of
per&s;ecution, that of rekindling the pious
zeal of a great portion of the people of
France. They returned to the religion of
their fathers, not from the &s;ame motives as
tho&s;e which influenced the fine ladies and
<PB N="76" REF="95">
gentlemen of Paris, becau&s;e it was con|nected
with regal government; but becau&s;e,
wearied with revolutionary calamities, they
&s;tood in need of the &s;oothing con&s;olations
of devotion; and the churches became
crouded places of re&s;ort.</P>
<P>It was not, however, in tho&s;e religious
temples that the illu&s;trious convert to the
Catholic faith, Mon&s;. La Harpe, became
a preacher of its doctrines. Like the hero
of Mr. Greaves's novel, Mon&s;. La Harpe
took courage to attack the devil in his
&s;tronge&s;t holds. Being a per&s;on of high
literary merit, he had been cho&s;en to fill
the rhetorical chair in the Lyceum. From
that place, where, a few moons before, he
had de&s;canted on the glorious conque&s;ts of
philo&s;ophy over &s;uper&s;tition, and of liberty
and the rights of man over de&s;poti&s;m and
&s;lavery; he now poured forth the recanta|tion
of his errors in &s;o eloquent and touch|ing
<PB N="77" REF="96">
a &s;train, that the neighbouring &s;quare
and &s;treets re-echoed the long and tumul|tuous
applau&s;es of his fair auditory, for the
majority were always ladies.</P>
<P>The lecturer, not &s;atisfied with the vic|tory
gained over infidelity in this &s;eat of
&s;cience, of which it had been &s;o long in
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, pur&s;ued that pernicious &s;y&s;tem
into another of its fortre&s;&s;es, the regions of
plea&s;ure. Mon&s;. La Harpe, becoming a
Catholic, was too &s;ingular an event not to
attract general notice; and as Catholici&s;m
happened to be in fa&s;hion, the proprietors
of various places of amu&s;ement thought a
few lectures from Mon&s;. La Harpe, on
&startq;the religion of our fathers,&endq; would be
no unprofitable &s;peculation. Accordingly,
the &s;plendid walks and fairy bowers of
Idalia, which, till then, had only re-echoed
the &s;ounds of gaiety and plea&s;ure, now re-&s;ounded
with the vehement imprecations of
<PB N="78" REF="97">
La Harpe again&s;t that vile revolutionary
philo&s;ophy of the Rights of Man, which
had overthrown the religion of our fathers.
Mon&s;. La Harpe continued to be the rage
in Paris, till he was &s;ucceeded by another
fa&s;hionable novelty, which happened to be
Abraham Effendi, the Turki&s;h Amba&s;&s;a|dor.
Upon Abraham Effendi's arrival, the
fa&s;hionable and butterfly-tribe for&s;ook once
more &startq;the religion of their fathers,&endq; a fa|bric
long &s;ince undermined, and now ha&s;|tening
to decay, after gilding for a moment
its venerable ruins with their glittering
wings.</P>
<P>But another &s;ect was now ari&s;ing, which
threatened more formidable danger to the
Roman Catholic religion than all the edicts
of Jabobin ferocity. Some &s;erious and well|intentioned
men, who were &s;en&s;ible that the
human mind without religion feels a void,
which &s;omething better mu&s;t be found to
<PB N="79" REF="98">
fill up than the doctrine of atoms, or the
wor&s;hip of rea&s;on, have become the founders
of a new &s;y&s;tem, which, &s;etting a&s;ide the
dogmas of the Roman Catholic creed, con|nected,
they a&s;&s;ert, with ignorance and &s;uper|&s;tition,
re&s;ts only on tho&s;e points in which
men of all religions are agreed, the moral
goverment of the world by the Supreme
Being, and the immortality of the &s;oul.
This &s;ect, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of
<HI>Theophilanthropi&s;ts,</HI> the friends of God and
man, had formed various little &s;ocieties in
Paris before their opinions were publicly
known. The &s;implicity of their wor&s;hip,
&s;omewhat re&s;embling that of the Di&s;&s;enters
in England, gained the attention of a few
lettered men, and the benevolence of their
doctrines became the public theme of pane|gyric
of a member of the Directory, Lare|velliere
Lepaux, who publi&s;hed a pamphlet,
the object of which was to rai&s;e the&s;e doc|trines
into repute, by &s;hewing the incon|&s;i&s;tency
<PB N="80" REF="99">
of the Roman Catholic religion with
liberty. This pamphlet was an&s;wered by
Gregoire, the learned and patriotic Bi&s;hop
of Blois, with much warmth, as a calumny
again&s;t the nation: &s;ince the great majority,
he a&s;&s;erted, were both Catholics and Repub|licans,
and the mo&s;t democratic governments
in Europe, the &s;maller Cantons of Switzer|land,
were &s;tedfa&s;t in that belief.</P>
<P>La Revelliere Lepaux obtained the title of
high-prie&s;t of the new &s;ect, which thus
rai&s;ed into notice became the object of vari|ous
calumnies. Some a&s;&s;erted it to be a
ne&s;t of terrori&s;ts, who, under the ma&s;k of
religion, and the liberty allowed to every
kind of wor&s;hip, met only to frame the
means of bringing round again their late
&s;y&s;tem. Others were a&s;&s;ured that this &s;ect
was nothing but a band of Athei&s;ts and
Philo&s;ophers, who a&s;&s;embled only to pro|pagate
principles which, di&s;believing them|&s;elves,
<PB N="81" REF="100">
they intended to make in&s;truments
of rooting out the Catholic faith.</P>
<P>Athei&s;ts and Jacobins perhaps mingle in
the&s;e congregations; but the ma&s;s appears
to be compo&s;ed of people of decent charac|ters
and manners, who, di&s;contented with
their former creeds, have embraced this
wor&s;hip till they are provided with a
better.</P>
<P>In their prayers they invoke the Supreme
Being as the author and governor of the
univer&s;e; they &s;ing hymns of grateful ac|knowledgment
for his bounties, and fill up
the hours of their wor&s;hip with a di&s;cour&s;e
on &s;ome moral &s;ubject, in which the obliga|tions
to maintain liberty, and keep inviolate
the laws of the Republic are never for|gotten.
The better-informed among the
Theophilanthropes are believers in Chri&s;ta|nity,
while others affect to talk with di&s;|dain
<PB N="82" REF="101">
of what they call the Chri&s;tian &s;ect:

<P>This new religious &s;ociety has the &s;up|port

its influence can be directed, without in|fringing
that impartiality in religious mat|ters
which the law requires. The mode&s;t
chambers, in which the founders of this
&s;ect fir&s;t a&s;&s;embled, are now changed for
the &s;pacious churches which can &s;carcely
hold the crowds who re&s;ort to their meet|ings.

their &s;imple rites; and as the places of both
wor&s;hips are in common, the wor&s;hippers
of both opinions often mingle together, and
learn at lea&s;t the divine le&s;&s;on of toleration.
How far the doctrines of this &s;ociety may
<PB N="83" REF="102">
contribute to add to the &s;tock of virtue in
France it is difficult to determine; but this
is certain, that the greate&s;t revolutionary
&s;inners, the Jacobins, have laid a&s;ide their
wor&s;hip of rea&s;on, and become the mo&s;t
&s;tedfa&s;t adherents to this creed; and &s;ice
the belief of immortality is the mo&s;t power|ful
motive to virtue, he who is convinced
of the exi&s;tence of the Supreme Being, and
offers up once a week his thank&s;givings to
the Giver of every good, for his loving|kindne&s;s

<P>IN our route to Schaffhau&s;en we had pa&s;&s;ed
the Haver&s;tein, a mountain which &s;erves
as a continuation of Mount Jura, and di|vides
the Canton of Ba&s;il from that of So|leure.
On the top of this mountain, which
is of difficult a&s;cent, we found a military
po&s;t, where our permi&s;&s;ions for travelling
in Switzerland were examined and enregi&s;|tered.
This pa&s;s is one of the keys of the
country, and appears, from its &s;ituation, to
be capable of being well defended again&s;t
very &s;uperior numbers; while the Canton
<PB N="86" REF="105">
of Ba&s;il, which lies at its ba&s;e, has no na|tural
&s;ecurity whatever again&s;t inva&s;ion.</P>
<P>The de&s;cent from this mountain, through
a pa&s;&s;age cut in the rock on its &s;ummit, pre|&s;ents
many points of per&s;pective which we
then thought &s;ublime, for we had not yet
gazed on tho&s;e &s;tupendous monuments, be|fore
which all other objects &s;ink into little|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>From the town of Olten, belonging to
the Canton of Soleure, and &s;ituated at the
di&s;tance of half a league from the mountain,
in a fine cultivated valley, through which
flows the Aar; we proceeded along that river
to Arau, in the Canton of Berne. A few
miles beyond we cro&s;&s;ed a river called the
Da, at Lentzburg, a &s;mall neat town in the
&s;ame Canton; at Millingen we pa&s;&s;ed the
Reu&s;s; this river, as well as the Limat,
falls into the Aar, which, thus enriched by
<PB N="87" REF="106">
the principal rivers of Switzerland, &s;wells
to a mighty volume the waters of the
Rhine.</P>
<P>The country from Olten to Schaffhau&s;en,
though full of tho&s;e beautiful land&s;capes
with which Switzerland abounds, pre&s;ents
few &s;cenes except the noble views over the
Lake of Zuric, which leave la&s;ting traces
on the memory.</P>
<P>On our return from Zuric we cro&s;&s;ed a
chain of hills on our left, and de&s;cended into
the rich vale of Bremgarten. In&s;tead of
repa&s;&s;ing the Haver&s;tein, we directed our
cour&s;e along the foot of Mount Jura, to
meet the road that leads from Soleure over
this ridge of mountains, which continues
to &s;eparate the two Cantons. At Bal&s;tal, a
little village &s;ituated at the foot of tho&s;e
mountains, we went to &s;ee a cataract, of
which we had heard a magnificent de&s;crip|tion.
<PB N="88" REF="107">
The rocky channel was bold and ro|mantic,
but the heat had dried up its wa|ters.
Our path lay through the church|yard
of the village, and we were particu|larly
&s;truck with the pious homage paid to
the memory of the dead, not only in the
gilded tomb-&s;tones and painted cro&s;&s;es,
which were &s;tuck thick over the ground;
but in the humble affection which had
given the grave it&s;elf an air of animation,
by planting the pink, the violet, and other
&s;weet-&s;cented herbs, on the green mounds,
beneath which repo&s;ed the mouldering du&s;t.
In&s;tead of the murky atmo&s;phere, and re|pul&s;ive
gloom of a receptacle of the dead,
the church-yard, placed amid&s;t wooded
rocks and pa&s;toral hills, and emitting the
&s;weet &s;ragrance of newly-&s;pringing flowers,
and the fre&s;h garlands which were hung
around the tombs, excited plea&s;ing images
of hope to the mind, and led to &s;oothing
meditation. I recollected the wi&s;h of O&s;|&s;ian,
<PB N="89" REF="108">
&startq;O, lay me, ye that &s;ee the light,
near &s;ome rock of my hills; let the thick
bazels be around, let the ru&s;tling oak be
near. Green be the place of my re&s;t; and
let the &s;ound of the di&s;tant torrent be
heard.&endq;</P>
<P>How remote from the&s;e tender cares of
mourning humanity is the treatment ob&s;erv|ed
in France towards the dead; and which
might &s;eem a relap&s;e to barbari&s;m, if we did
not find, even among the mo&s;t &s;avage na|tions,
&s;ome civilized marks of human re|verence,
&s;ome decent ceremonial paid to the
relicks of our mortal nature! It might, per|haps,
be nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;train the di&s;play of
that vanity which, before the revolution,
decked its mockery of woe with idle pomp
and pageantry; but &s;tern indeed mu&s;t be
the reformer, who admires that cold-blood|ed
philo&s;ophy which con&s;igns tho&s;e to
whom we were bound by the holie&s;t ties of
<PB N="90" REF="109">
humanity, or the deare&s;t feelings of the
heart, without regret, to the unhallowed
proces-verbal of a municipal officer, who
&s;trides away with indecent ha&s;te before the
yet un&s;tiffened corp&s;e, and, like death, the
common leveller, hurls it into the common
pit, among undi&s;tingui&s;hed heaps of dead.</P>
<P>During the epocha of the wor&s;hip of rea|&s;on,
a tacit approbation of this annihilation
of vulgar prejudices might have been wrung
from fear; &s;ince at that time, among&s;t the
well-fed mon&s;ters in the republic, death,
and the grave&mdash;
<Q><L>&mdash;&startq;Upturn'd</L>
<L>Their no&s;trils wide into the murky air,</L>
<L>Sagacious of their quarry<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Milton</NOTE>&mdash;&endq;</L></Q>
and revelled on the dead, as their pioneers,
terror, and Jacobin-government, rioted on
the living.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="110">
But when public or private &s;afety are no
longer endangered by the indulgence of
tender affections, even though equality
&s;hould be &s;ometimes wounded by the little
di&s;tinctions which they might love to con|fer
on the mouldering clay, it is &s;urely
tyranny over the mo&s;t amiable weakne&s;&s;es
of our nature to tear thus rudely from the
fond &s;urvivor that form which, a few
hours before, was folded to the heart in the
la&s;t agonies of &s;eparation, and to which it
&s;till clings with the bitterne&s;s of unavailing
regret!</P>
<P>We returned to Ba&s;il on a Sunday morn|ing,
time enough to join a throng of wor|&s;hippers
at the French Prote&s;tant church,
who&s;e re&s;pectful demeanour and devout
attention formed a &s;ingular and &s;oothing
contra&s;t to the coar&s;e impiety we had &s;o
lately witne&s;&s;ed at Paris; where we had &s;een
<PB N="92" REF="111">
altars overthrown, the &s;urplice and the
mitre transformed into capari&s;ons for hor&s;es;
had heard the commi&s;&s;aries of revolutionary
committees boa&s;t, that at their Bacchanalian
orgies their gro&s;s libations had been poured
from &s;acramental cups, and had ob&s;erved
that no political bla&s;phemy was &s;o &s;triking
to tho&s;e reformers as the &s;lighte&s;t mark of
re&s;pect for religion. The practice of &s;hut|ting
up the gates of the Swi&s;s towns, dur|ing
divine &s;ervice, to prevent the rolling of
carriages, though attended with inconveni|ence
to travellers, is &s;o far plea&s;ing, as it
con&s;ecrates one day in &s;even to relaxation
and repo&s;e. The &s;trict ob&s;ervance of this
day of re&s;t in Switzerland forms an agree|able
contra&s;t to the bu&s;y, as well as di&s;|&s;ipated
manner in which both Sunday and
Decadi are pa&s;&s;ed in France; which fe&s;ti|vals,
being ever at war with each other,
neither are celebrated with re&s;pect.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="112">
Not only are the &s;tated returns of inter|vals
of re&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for man, but the voice
of mercy calls aloud on the French legi&s;la|ture
to interpo&s;e between the re&s;tle&s;s acti|vity
or avarice of the ma&s;ter, and the bea&s;t.
Nothing is more plea&s;ing than to ob&s;erve
throughout Switzerland the care, and even
tenderne&s;s which is &s;hewn to the animal
creation; while in France they feel the pri|mary
cur&s;e of labour inflicted in all its &s;e|verity.
Sunday and Decadi, alike the load|ed
hor&s;e drags on his heavy burden; alike
the mercile&s;s la&s;h for ever re&s;ounds along
the &s;treets, and tho&s;e who&s;e nerves are not
&s;teeled again&s;t every pain but their own,
are denied the relief of knowing, that an
appointed re&s;pite from toil is the privilege
of that mi&s;erable race.</P>
<P>Among the moral diver&s;ities of Switzer|land,
none are marked with more preci&s;ion
<PB N="94" REF="113">
than their territorial belief. In a ride of
two or three hours from the Canton of
Ba&s;il into that of Soleure, and over a branch
of the Canton of Berne into that of Lucerne,
we found our&s;elves alternately on Catholic
and Prote&s;tant ground. In whatever cau&s;e
originated the&s;e whim&s;ical boundaries of
their geographical religion, which hereto|fore
lighted up &s;o often the flames of civil
di&s;&s;ention, it is &s;oothing to ob&s;erve, that
&s;ince the beginning of the pre&s;ent century,
the Swi&s;s have di&s;covered that the &s;word is
not the mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive weapon of religious
controver&s;y. Two religions, that of the
Roman church, and the a&s;&s;emblage of dog|mas
of the &s;ixteenth century, called the
Helvetic confe&s;&s;ion, are the exclu&s;ive reli|gions
of the Helvetic confederacy. Hume
has &s;omewhere ob&s;erved, that the hatred of
Polemics is mo&s;t inveterate, where the points
in di&s;pute are the lea&s;t remote; it is not
<PB N="95" REF="114">
therefore &s;urpri&s;ing that civil di&s;&s;entions in
Switzerland &s;hould have been carried to
&s;uch exce&s;s, &s;ince the faith, for which both
parties contended, is conceived in the &s;ame
&s;pirit of intolerance, and buried in the &s;ame

<P>OF the forty thou&s;and inhabitants, which
compo&s;e the population of the city and
Canton of Ba&s;il, the burghers forming the
fifth part of that number alone enjoy, or
fancy they enjoy the rights of equality.
The people of Ba&s;il are divided into two
di&s;tinct cla&s;&s;es, that of the burghers, con&s;i&s;t|ing
of eight thou&s;and per&s;ons, and that of
the other inhabitants; which la&s;t cla&s;s in|crea&s;es
<PB N="97" REF="116">
in the &s;ame proportion that the fir&s;t
dimini&s;hes from year to year, and now
amounts to about &s;even thou&s;and per&s;ons.
This latter cla&s;s is in a &s;tate of complete de|gradation,
excluded from all political rights,
can exerci&s;e no trade, and the individuals of
which it is formed are con&s;idered merely
as &s;trangers, to whom the privilege is grant|ed
of living in the town, place~d, for the
mo&s;t part, under the immediate re&s;pon&s;ibi|lity
of the manufacturer or artizan by whom
they are employed, and who is bound to
take &s;uch mea&s;ures re&s;pecting them, as &s;hall
prevent their becoming burden&s;ome to the
&s;tate.</P>
<P>When per&s;ons of this cla&s;s are born in
Ba&s;il, when even their parents have been
natives of the city for &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ge|nerations,
they acquire not one further pre|rogative
from the&s;e circum&s;tances; and the
admi&s;&s;ion of a few of the&s;e individuals to
<PB N="98" REF="117">
the rights of burghers, is always attended
with &s;o many ob&s;tacles, that the in&s;tances
in which it takes place are extremely rare.
Few of this cla&s;s attain con&s;iderable wealth,
yet the increa&s;e of their number, their per|&s;everance
in remaining in this humiliating
condition, while they are forced to &s;upport
the load of heavy taxes from which the
burghers are exempted, and receive no other
benefit from the government than per&s;onal
protection and &s;afety, prove, however,
that they at lea&s;t enjoy &s;ome advantages of
which they were not before po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and
give a &s;trong idea of the wretchedne&s;s of
their &s;ituation in the countries which they
have for&s;aken.</P>
<P>What is remarkable enough in this cele|brated
land of freedom, where the the poet
tells us, that
<Q><L>&startq;Even the pea&s;ant boa&s;ts his rights to &s;can,</L>
<L>And learns to venerate him&s;elf as man.&endq;</L></Q>
<PB N="99" REF="118">
All the pea&s;antry in the Canton of Ba&s;il,
with only the exception of the little town
of Lie&s;tal, which enjoys a few municipal
privileges, are literally &s;erfs, and annexed
to the &s;oil. In the feudal times, the&s;e peo|ple,
who belonged to their re&s;pective chiefs,
were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively &s;old, with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions
on which they were found, to the city of
Ba&s;il, then an imperial city. The&s;e Gothic
prerogatives, however, have long &s;ince been
prudently thrown into the back-ground,
and are now le&s;s likely than ever to be re|vived,
at the di&s;tance of half a mile from
the &s;houts of equality, fraternity, and the
rights of man.</P>
<P>A &s;tranger who travels through France
into Switzerland, cannot fail to ob&s;erve the
different appearance of the habitations of
the pea&s;antry of each country. The abject
condition of this cla&s;s in France, previous
<PB N="100" REF="119">
to the revolution, was one of the mo&s;t pro|minent
features of the wretchedne&s;s of the
government; and &s;ufficient time has not yet
clap&s;ed to change the external marks of
mi&s;ery. The commanding chateau &s;till
frowns in gloomy magnificence, over the
mud-walled hut, though the inhabitants are
now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of equal rights. In Switzer|land,
the pea&s;ant's habitation, however
poor, has the air of comfort and convenience.
Every wooden cottage has its garden, or
orchard, and the limpid brook running be|fore
the door of the thatch, gives the whole
an air of fre&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P>The pea&s;ants of the Canton of Ba&s;il are,
like the generality of pea&s;ants in Switzer|land,
well clothed and fed, have the liberty,
which is no &s;mall prerogative, of judging,
in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, their own di&s;putes,
without the intervention of the Bailiff,
<PB N="101" REF="120">
who&s;e trea&s;ury is too often &s;welled by the
fines of contention; and have al&s;o the pri|vilege
of bearing arms.</P>
<P>Their neighbours, the French pea&s;antry,
need no longer look upon the&s;e advantages
with the glance of envy or the &s;igh of re|gret;
&s;ince for the French hu&s;bandman,
above every other cla&s;s of Frenchmen, the
revolution hitherto has been made. While
the nobility, the clergy, the pen&s;ioners of
the &s;tate, have been ruined; while com|merce,
for a while annihilated amid&s;t the
overwhelming &s;hock of political convul|&s;ions,
is now but &s;lowly awakening once
more to life, the hu&s;bandman, emancipated
from every feudal calim, exonerated from
every &s;pecies of per&s;onal &s;ervitude, di&s;bur|thened
of every tax, and relieved from every
oppre&s;&s;ion, has, above all others, had cau&s;e
to ble&s;s the dawn of liberty. Even the
horrible tempe&s;t of revolutionary terror
<PB N="102" REF="121">
pa&s;&s;ed harmle&s;s over his head; and while
the palace was deva&s;tated, and the chateau
levelled to the ground, his cottage &s;tood
erect; amid&s;t the violation of all other po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions,
his property, with the exception
of a few revolutionary requi&s;itions, was re|&s;pected;
and, amid&s;t ho&s;ts of executioners,
his per&s;on was &s;afe. During the long
cour&s;e and va&s;t depreciation of paper-money,
the farmer paid, with the labour of a week,
the rents of the year; and was enabled, not
only to augment his &s;tock, but often be|came
him&s;elf a purcha&s;er of land. Suffi|ciently
an egoti&s;t to take every po&s;&s;ible ad|vantage
of circum&s;tances, at the &s;ame time
that he di&s;bur&s;ed his rent in paper, he &s;old
his corn only for money; while the &s;tarv|ing
proprietor of land, was compelled, like
Belvidera, to &startq;part with the antient orna|ments
of ma&s;&s;y plate,&endq; to buy the wheat
which grew on his own ground for the
&s;upport of him&s;elf and his family. With the
<PB N="103" REF="122">
return of money the landlord, indeed, has
been re&s;cued from poverty, by receiving his
revenue in &s;olid coin; which the farmers,
immen&s;ely enriched by the reign of paper,
are well enabled to pay. They at pre&s;ent
form a bold, independent cla&s;s of yeomanry,
a cla&s;s till now unknown in this country,
and their once bare-legged wives and
daughters proudly di&s;play their white
&s;tockings, rich-laced caps, &s;hining pen|dants,
and golden cro&s;&s;es, which, in the
country, &s;till continue to be worn as a badge
of their faith, as well as a decoration of
their per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The population of the Canton of Ba&s;il
being very far beyond the proportion of its
extent of territory, great numbers are em|ployed
in manufactures, particularly that of
cottons and ribbons, which are brought to
great perfection. Over the manufacturers
of the&s;e articles, the governors find it ad|vantageous
<PB N="104" REF="123">
to manife&s;t &s;ome portion of their
right of &s;overeignty; for in vain the father
of a family may cultivate his field of flax,
and prepare it for u&s;e; in vain his wife may
&s;pin, his infants turn the wheel which
winds the thread, and he him&s;elf weave the
woof; the web when woven is not at his
di&s;po&s;ition&mdash;he has no right over the pro|duce
of his labour, no power to di&s;po&s;e of
what he has acquired by the &s;weat of his
brow and the toil of his hands; he mu&s;t
carry his little &s;tock to the capital of his
Canton, and there, and only there, is per|mitted
to &s;ell it; while the burgher of the
town, who is the purcha&s;er, has previou&s;ly
arranged the price at which it &s;hall be &s;old.
A more vexatious law than this is, I be|lieve,
&s;carcely to be &s;ound in the whole code
of de&s;poti&s;m.</P>
<P>If &s;uch be the paternal care of the politi|cal
fathers of Ba&s;il over their children, it
<PB N="105" REF="124">
would be &s;uperfluous to expect from them
any marks of tender regard for tho&s;e, who,
as &s;trangers, have no claim to their protec|tion.
But again&s;t none of the family of
the human race is this republican choler &s;o
vehemently di&s;played, as again&s;t that mi&s;er|able
victim of Chri&s;tian wrath and con|tempt,
the follower of the religion of
Mo&s;es. In de&s;pite of his imputed crimes,
a dreadful legacy inherited from his ance&s;|try,
the Jew, who has found in many
countries of Europe an a&s;ylum, in France
has found a country. This de&s;pi&s;ed wan|derer
can here cling fa&s;t to his home, and
rai&s;ed from that &s;tate of humiliation into
which our Anti-Chri&s;tian barbarity had

and, proud of its privileges, grants as
a boon what ought to be conceded as a right;
but of that toleration which regards as
children of the &s;ame original, and entitled
to an equal &s;hare of his beneficence, the
profe&s;&s;ors of the primitive faith of the Pa|triarchs,
the followers of the dogmas of the
Catholic creed, and of Calvin, and the be|lievers
in the &s;imple truths of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Again&s;t this innovating principle the Ba|&s;ilians
for two centuries pa&s;t have &s;truggled
with zealous uniformity. Previous to the
French revolution, the epocha of Jewi&s;h
liberty, Gregoire, di&s;tingui&s;hed no le&s;s for
a &s;trict adherence to his own faith, than for
that large benevolence of &s;oul which hails a
brother in every religious creed, became the
avowed advocate of this per&s;ecuted race,
<PB N="107" REF="126">
and prepared their way to liberty, by incul|cating
on the minds of their per&s;ecutors
the heavenly le&s;&s;on of toleration. Even the
pale-faced cre&s;cent, catching &s;ome particles
of its divine light, has at lenght reflected its
favoring beams on the celebration of Chri&s;|tian
wor&s;hip. But in the Prote&s;tant Canton
of Ba&s;il no Catholic rites are allowed, and a
Jew is an object of uncea&s;ing abhorrence.
Not only is the re&s;idence of the&s;e elder bre|thren
of their faith forbidden by the burgh|ers
of Ba&s;il; but without the expre&s;s per|mi&s;&s;ion
of the &s;upreme magi&s;trate, or ha|zarding
the payment of a heavy fine, dur&s;t
any I&s;raeliti&s;h wanderer re&s;t within the
walls for one night his wearied head. No
act of commerce can pa&s;s between a Jew
and a Ba&s;ilian, however equal their talents
in the arts of trade, without the intervention
of a public officer in aid of the latter; and &s;o
careful is the protecting hand of govern|ment
in favor of the burgher, that no
<PB N="108" REF="127">
contract with a Jew, unle&s;s ratified by
the burgo-ma&s;ter, is binding on the be|liever.</P>
<P>It has been invidiou&s;ly &s;tated, that the
jealou&s;y of trade has &s;ugge&s;ted the&s;e prudent
precautions; but the &s;uperior attainments
of the inhabitants of Ba&s;il, in the &s;cience of
commerce, renders &s;uch a precaution un|nece&s;&s;ary.
No per&s;on of di&s;cernment will
put in competition the fine commercial in|telligence
of a burgher of Ba&s;il, with the
rude cunning of the mi&s;erable outca&s;t of his
pro&s;cription; and this zeal again&s;t Judai&s;m
mu&s;t be re&s;olved into the abhorrence with
which Ba&s;il Chri&s;tians con&s;ider this impious
&s;ect, delivered over to final reprobation. The
Jew, who does not under&s;tand the niceties
of Ba&s;il belief, might indeed rea&s;onably ex|pect
to find in a free &s;tate the privileges al|lowed
to his brethren in de&s;potic countries
by Catholic inqui&s;itors: he may perhaps be
<PB N="109" REF="128">
allowed to murmur at the detail of in|ho&s;pitality
with which he is treated at
Ba&s;il, and exclaim with the Jew of Ve|nice:</P>

the Members of the Council, and of the Profe&s;&s;ors of the
Univer&s;ity.&mdash;Ancient and Modern State of Litera|ture.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we ob&s;erve in the Canton of
Ba&s;il, which is compo&s;ed of forty thou&s;and
inhabitants, that more than thirty thou&s;and
of that number enjoy no privileges, it will
be &s;ome relief to find that liberty has taken
refuge among the remainder. The actual
number of burghers does not exceed &s;even
thou&s;and, and of the&s;e no more than three
hundred wield the &s;ceptre of government
for life, under the name of members of the
great and little councils.</P>
<P>Although, when vacancies take place, the
members of the&s;e councils are cho&s;en from
<PB N="111" REF="130">
among&s;t the burghers, they are not cho&s;en
by them. The care of the nomination falls
to the lot of the members of the councils
them&s;elves, who, knowing from experience
the fatigues and difficulties of governing,
are &s;uppo&s;ed to be better informed than the
ma&s;s of the burghers, what heads are be&s;t
organized for the duties of that important
&s;tation.</P>
<P>The right of citizen&s;hip is never ac|quired,
as in France, by re&s;idence: the am|bitious
wight who a&s;pires to this di&s;tinc|tion,
after obtaining the permi&s;&s;ion of the
grand council, mu&s;t purcha&s;e the privilege
with a large &s;um of money, unle&s;s he be|comes
enamoured of &s;ome fair daughter of
a burgher, when he is allowed to make a
compo&s;ition for his freedom by paying one
half in money, and as a compromi&s;e for
the other, taxing him&s;elf with a wife. But
though admitted to be a burgher, the privi|lege
<PB N="112" REF="131">
of being eligible to any office of the
government belongs only to his po&s;terity of
the third or fourth generation. Criminal
conviction &s;u&s;pends all civil rights, and the
crime of bankruptcy at Ba&s;il, ranked by
other governments under the cla&s;s of mis|fortunes,
attaints with the &s;ame degradation
even the highe&s;t officers of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>Le&s;t thirty-nine thou&s;and &s;even hundred
inhabitants of the Canton of Ba&s;il &s;hould
murmur at being governed by three hundred
&s;elf-elected individuals, means have been
taken to le&s;&s;en the appearance of this u&s;ur|pation
in the eyes of the people. With this
view the elections of the vacant &s;eats of go|vernment
are made by lot: when a vacancy
happens &s;ix candidates are cho&s;en by the
great council, after which tho&s;e candidates
draw lots for the place.</P>
<P>This mode of election may perhaps be
<PB N="113" REF="132">
pardonable with re&s;pect to the members of
the great and little council. Perhaps no
eminent talents are requi&s;ite to fill tho&s;e
&s;tations, or to perform the parts of burgo|ma&s;ters
or tribunes; and indeed the opinion,
that it requires little art to govern, appears to
be &s;preading &s;o generally throughout Europe,
that in many parts of it men &s;eem di&s;po&s;ed
to govern them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But what is not to be forgiven is having
adopted this mode of drawing lots to fill up
the vacant &s;eats at the univer&s;ity. Tho&s;e
&s;uperior endowments of mind, which give
the right of pre&s;iding over the re&s;earches of
&s;cience, are in all ages and nations di&s;pen&s;ed
with par&s;imony, and at Ba&s;il are probably
for the mo&s;t part di&s;pen&s;ed in vain: &s;ince
no doubt chance often bids dullne&s;s mount
the throne, while black-balled genius
&startq;wa&s;tes its talents on the de&s;art air.&endq; Of
this there is a remarkable in&s;tance on the
<PB N="114" REF="133">
records of the univer&s;ity, where tho&s;e orna|ments
of their country, the illu&s;trious ma|thematicians,
the Bernouillis, who would
have been the ornaments of any country,
after frequent rejection by black-balls, ob|tained
at length the chairs of profe&s;&s;ors of
rhetoric and botany.</P>
<P>It may indeed be now alledged in ju&s;ti|fication
of this practice, that there is little to
teach &s;ince there are few to learn: the col|leges
are without pupils, and the profe&s;&s;or|&s;hips
are merely &s;inecures. Yet Ba&s;il was
once the centre of &s;cience, the cho&s;en re&s;i|dence
of the great Era&s;mus, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
an univer&s;ity, the profe&s;&s;ors of which were
compo&s;ed of the mo&s;t enlightened men of
the age, and on which the Eulers, and the
Boehmens conferred celebrity: and we are
told by Mr. Cox, that he found &s;hop|keepers
in this city reading Virgil, Horace,
and Plutarch; from which he was, no
<PB N="115" REF="134">
doubt, well authorized to draw his conclu|&s;ion,
that there is no country in the world
where the people are &s;o happy. But what|ever
were the Halcyon days of ta&s;te and
learning at the period of Mr. Cox's vi&s;it,
it is a melancholy fact, that this literary
&s;pirit has entirely evaporated &s;ince his de|parture.
The&s;e lettered triumphs, the
&startq;tales of other times,&endq; are buried in ten|fold
gloom: the Swi&s;s them&s;elves admit,
that Ba&s;il is the Boeotia of their country,
and Horace, Virgil, and Plutarch, are now
in general di&s;repute, not only among the
&s;hopkeepers, but even among the whole&s;ale
dealers of this once cla&s;&s;ic city.</P>
<P>Science is in few countries the certain
road to wealth, but the modern rulers of
Ba&s;il &s;eem to have determined, that it &s;hall
there be the &s;ure path to poverty. Since,
while tho&s;e citizens, who&s;e knowledge ex|tends
only to the rules of arthmetic, who
<PB N="116" REF="135">
read nothing but their ledgers, and under|&s;tand
nothing but the cour&s;e of exchange,
enjoy all the lavi&s;h luxuries of affluence,
the ill-fated wight whom the love of learn|ing,
or the impul&s;e of genius leads to the
profe&s;&s;or&s;hip of a college, is forced to con|tent
him&s;elf with that narrow &s;tipend,
which, in&s;tead of keeping pace with the
increa&s;e of wealth, remains, amid&s;t its flow|ing
tide, an antique monument of the few
and &s;imple wants of early times.</P>
<P>But to have annexed poverty to letters
appears not to have been thought &s;ufficient
by that portion of the prai&s;e-worthy Helve|tic
body, which pre&s;ides over the de&s;tinies
of Ba&s;il. They have &s;tamped a mark of
di&s;grace on the brow of &s;cience; and whil&s;t
the taylor, the fi&s;herman, the &s;hoe-maker,
the boatman, all men but the man of let|ters,
can a&s;&s;ert their claims as burghers to
the public honors and dignities of the &s;tate,
<Q><PB N="117" REF="136">
&startq;And &s;aving ignorance enthrones by law;&endq;</Q>
<BIBL>POPE.</BIBL>
the profe&s;&s;ors of the univer&s;ity are excluded.
Genius is treated like other &s;trangers in the
city of Ba&s;il, and refu&s;ed all participation
in the rights and immunities of its privi|leged
burghers.</P>
<P>Even here, however, we find a cho&s;en
few have not bowed the knee to Baal, and
who cultivate letters with the ardor of ele|gant
minds; but their number is not &s;uf|ficient
to &s;ave their city from reproach, and
tho&s;e accompli&s;hed exceptions only &s;erve to
e&s;tabli&s;h the general rule, as a &s;olitary
flower on a de&s;art heath reminds the tra|veller
of the &s;urrounding barrenne&s;s. While
I recall the few men of &s;uperior intellec|tual
endowments, which Ba&s;il &s;till can
boa&s;t, the image of my venerable friend,
Colonel Frey, naturally pre&s;ents it&s;elf to
my mind: that re&s;pectable veteran in litera|ture
<PB N="118" REF="137">
as well as arms, who unites with tho&s;e
poli&s;hed manners, acquired during fifty years
of military &s;ervice in France, all the more
&s;olid attainments of learning and &s;cience: he
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a fine library, one of the few cabi|nets
of natural hi&s;tory at Ba&s;il, which, rich
in petrifications, marbles, and minerals, de|&s;erves
the attention of &s;trangers, and pa&s;&s;es
the evening of an active life in the placid
&s;atisfactions of &s;tudy. I enjoyed the ad|vantage
of his protection during my &s;tay at
Ba&s;il, and have a &s;ufficiently di&s;cerning &s;en&s;e
of merit to know how to appreciate his
friend&s;hip. Colonel Frey's &s;econd &s;on is
married to M. du F&mdash;, the romantic
hi&s;tory of who&s;e parents is &s;ketched in my
fir&s;t volume of letters on France.</P>
<P>Mr. Le Grand, member of the great
council, an ardent and enlightened friend of
the French Republic, had taught his in|fants
to li&s;p the cheri&s;hed &s;ounds of liberty,

and chaunt its favorite airs with &s;uch fond
enthu&s;ia&s;m, that his hou&s;e &s;eemed to me a

<P>Although the number of enlightened
men in Ba&s;il is very incon&s;iderable, it is ea&s;y
to perceive, that in the general re&s;urrec|tion
to liberty, which Switzerland is about
to experience, this Canton, to borrow an

<P>DURING our &s;tay at Ba&s;il, we vi&s;ited,
like other travellers, the ar&s;enal, the orna|ments

&s;words, and brea&s;t-plates, which, from their

<L>Such as no more the&s;e aged eyes &s;hall view.&endq;</L>
<BIBL>POPE'S HOMER.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>We then proceeded to the cathedral, a
fine piece of architecture, but disfigured
without by a coating of red paint: what is
mo&s;t intere&s;ting within is the tomb of
<PB N="121" REF="140">
Era&s;mus, a frugal tablet of common mar|ble
&s;tuck again&s;t the wall.</P>
<P>At the public library we were &s;hewn,
with extreme politene&s;s, the various and
valuable curio&s;ities it contains; &s;uch as the
collection of manu&s;cripts which is highly
precious, manu&s;cript letters of Era&s;mus,
the original &s;ketches of mo&s;t of the fine
pictures of Holbein, the Pa&s;&s;ion painted in
the fir&s;t &s;tyle of this ma&s;ter, and other ad|mirable
pieces worthy of the public library
and mu&s;eum of Paris.</P>
<P>We &s;aw M. Mechel's fine collection of
engravings, and we al&s;o vi&s;ited the hideous
&s;eries of figures called the Dance of Death,
and painted by Kleber, a pupil of Holbein.
After &s;eeing the&s;e, and &s;ome other le&s;s im|portant
curio&s;ities, we took leave of our
friends at Ba&s;il, in order to enjoy a nearer
view of tho&s;e &s;ublime objects, which we
<PB N="122" REF="141">
had hitherto &s;een only at a di&s;tance, lifting
their hoary heads to the heavens.</P>
<P>We cro&s;&s;ed again the Haver&s;tein, and
pa&s;&s;ed through Olten to Arbourg, a &s;mall
town on the river Aar, overlooked by a
ca&s;tle, which is the northern ba&s;tile of the
Canton of Berne for &s;tate-offenders. From
Zoffingen, a plea&s;ant and populous town
about two leagues from Arbourg, we pro|ceeded
through a delicious country of gent|ly
&s;welling hills, and finely watered mea|dows,
to Sur&s;ee, a town of the Canton of
Lucerne. Half a mile from Sur&s;ee is the
Lake of Sempach, along which we travelled
nearly the whole of its length, and which
takes its name from a little town on the
ea&s;tern &s;ide, where was fought that ever
memorable battle which gave liberty to
Switzerland. With equal contempt of their
numbers and di&s;cipline, Duke Leopold, at
the head of a formidable phalanx, and at|tended
<PB N="123" REF="142">
by the fir&s;t nobility of the empire,
attacked the little army, con&s;i&s;ting of thir|teen
hundred men of the four confederate
Cantons, Lucerne, Uri, Schweitz, and Un|derwalden.
The Swi&s;s had in vain attempt|ed
to pierce the enemy's ranks, and the fate
of war hung doubtful; when Arnold de
Wilkenreid, devoting him&s;elf, like Decius,
to certain death, after recommending his
wife and children to the care of his country,
opened the way to victory, by throwing
him&s;elf on the lances of the Au&s;trians, who,
&s;eized with a&s;toni&s;hment at this effort of
de&s;perate valour, yielded to the impetuous
torrent for which Wilkenreid had freed a
pa&s;&s;age, and fled; leaving Leopold on the
field with the flower of his army.</P>
<P>On the &s;pot where this memorable vic|tory
was gained, is built a chapel in com|memoration
of the event; in which are
&s;een the portraits of the Duke of Au&s;tria
<PB N="124" REF="143">
and his chief nobility who peri&s;hed with
him, and who&s;e bodies were tran&s;ported for
burial to &s;ome di&s;tant abbey, while the a&s;hes
of the Swi&s;s heroes yet con&s;ecrate the field
of honor where they &s;o generou&s;ly poured
out their lives. Several of the&s;e chapels,
the monuments of the piety and valour of
the early Swi&s;s, are to be &s;een in this coun|try.
As fe&s;tivals and games were in&s;tituted
among the Greeks to keep alive the heroi|cal
deeds of their ance&s;tors, &s;o the Swi&s;s,
on the anniver&s;ary of great events, were
accu&s;tomed to go in &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ion to
tho&s;e chapels, and offer up their public
than&s;givings.</P>
<P>This practice, which has been long di&s;|continued
in other parts of Switzerland, is
&s;till ob&s;erved at this chapel. Every year,
on the ninth of July, a &s;olemn ma&s;s is per|formed,

<PB N="125" REF="144">

who, according to local tradition, for it does
not appear to be recorded in any hi&s;tory,
made u&s;e of this &s;tratagem to multiply the

picture&s;que. About half a league from the
<PB N="131" REF="150">
town we cro&s;&s;ed the Emmen, near the &s;pot
where it mingles its &s;treams with the Reu&s;s,
which pours its &s;welling and limpid wa|ters
of a gra&s;&s;y hue from the lake. Lu|cerne
is divided by this river, and the lake,
into unequal portions, but the communica|tion
is rendered ea&s;y and agreeable by means
of four bridges; one of which of ordinary
con&s;truction, &s;erves for the pa&s;&s;age of car|riages,
while the other three are calculated
only for foot pa&s;&s;engers. The&s;e bridges,
one of which is &s;ix or &s;even hundred feet in
length, and another from three to four
hundred feet, pre&s;ent delightful views over
the lake to the mountains, and &s;erve as
walks to the inhabitants, who are &s;heltered
from the &s;un and rain, by a roof &s;upported
at every ten &s;teps by pillars of wood: be|tween
tho&s;e pillars pannels are fixed, paint|ed
on both &s;ides, which repre&s;ent in
&s;ome places the mo&s;t celebrated events of
their national hi&s;tory, and in others &s;crip|ture-&s;ubjects,
<PB N="132" REF="151">
and fanciful figures of poetry
and romance, &s;uch as winged dragons,
griffins, devils, and centaurs:
<Q>&startq;Mon&s;ters and Hydras, and Chimaeras dire.&endq;</Q>
<BIBL>MILTON.</BIBL></P>
<P>Some of the&s;e paintings are well exe|cuted;
but are unfavorably placed on ac|count
of the &s;hadow of the roof. One of
our Lucerne friends pointed out a piece
which repre&s;ented an execution, the in&s;tru|ment
of death re&s;embles the machine, of
which &s;uch abhorred u&s;e was made in
France during the reign of terror, and robs
of the merit of the invention a member of
the fir&s;t national a&s;&s;embly, M. Gullotin,
who&s;e name it bears.</P>
<P>As we wi&s;hed to cro&s;s the Alps without
delay, we remained but a &s;hort time at Lu|cerne,
intending on our return to take a
more detailed view of this enchanting
<PB N="133" REF="152">
country. Before our departure we made a
vi&s;it to General Pfyffer, who&s;e plan in relief
of the little Cantons is an intere&s;ting monu|ment
of topographical genius and laborious
con&s;tancy. The General related to us with
his u&s;ual affability, all the perils and diffi|culties
he had encountered in the formation
of this admirable mimick-creation of &s;ilver
torrents, mo&s;&s;y fore&s;ts, tin hou&s;es, and gla&s;s
lakes.</P>
<P>We embarked our hor&s;es, and departing
from Lucerne at an early hour of a fine
cloudle&s;s morning, began our voyage down
the lake to Altorf. The hills ri&s;ing from
the &s;hores near the town, which are but of
little elevation, are covered for the mo&s;t
part with country-hou&s;es and gardens;
and here the inhabitants, in&s;tead of warring
with nature by &s;trait lines and trimmed
trees, had aided her loveline&s;s by their ta&s;te
in di&s;po&s;ition and forbearance in ornament.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="153">
At the di&s;tance of three miles from Lu|cerne
the lake opens on both &s;ides, &s;tretch|ing
away on the left to the Canton of Zug,
and on the right to that of Underwalden.
On the one &s;ide Mount Pilate, rifing ab|rupt
from the waters, di&s;played its &s;ublime
and uncovered head: on the other the lofty
but more humble Rigi poured down its nu|merous
torrents, illuminated by the &s;un|beams,
like &s;ilvered lines in &s;wift &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion,
at which we gazed with delight, while,
we were pa&s;&s;ing along tremendous rocks,
who&s;e va&s;t &s;hadows fell black upon the
clear azure of the waters. Before us the
mountains &s;welled maje&s;tically, clothed with
a luxuriancy of trees; but as we proceeded
the rocks narrowed, and &s;eemed to forbid
our progre&s;s.</P>
<P>At this point the breadth of the lake is
very incon&s;iderable; but having pa&s;&s;ed the&s;e
&s;traights a turn of the rock di&s;covers ano|ther
<PB N="135" REF="154">
ample &s;ea, whence we di&s;cerned the
lofty hills of Uri on our right; and to
the we&s;t a con&s;iderable portion of the re|fluent
lake that wa&s;hed the rocks of Under|walden.</P>
<P>On the left, beneath the inacce&s;&s;ible and
encircling craggs of the Rigi, is &s;ituated the
independent &s;tate of Ger&s;au, where we di&s;|embarked.</P>
<P>This Republic comprehending its re|gency,
&s;ingle, double, and triple councils,
trea&s;urer, grand &s;autier, &s;ecretaries, judges,
mini&s;ters, officers, naval and military force,
and the governed of all de&s;criptions, con|tains
from nine hundred to a thou&s;and &s;ouls.
Cavalry makes no part of the &s;trength of
this territory, &s;ince the lofty ramparts of
rock, by which it is divided from the main
land, are inacce&s;&s;ible to hor&s;es. It po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es,
however, a numerous fleet of boats, which
<PB N="136" REF="155">
rode at anchor before the port, and pre|vented
for &s;ome time the entrance of our
ve&s;&s;el. Having on our landing &s;auntered
to one part of the &s;tate to take a &s;urvey of
its edifices, our ears were a&s;&s;ailed by a tu|multuous
noi&s;e, which proceeded from the
tuneful throats of a multitude a&s;&s;embled in
the church at the other end of the repub|lic,
celebrating the prai&s;es of Saints Zeno
and Bridget.</P>
<P>The chief import of this republic is raw
&s;ilk, which is manufactured for Ba&s;il and
Zurich; its exports are principally fruit and
fi&s;h, in the capture of which the fleet is em|ployed
which we &s;aw moored in the har|bour.</P>
<P>Ger&s;au allied it&s;elf to the Democratic
Cantons in the beginning of the fourteenth
century, and adopted their form of govern|ment.
The hi&s;tory of the wars and treaties,
<PB N="137" REF="156">
troubles, dome&s;tic and foreign, of this
&s;mall republic, though it make no con&s;i|derable
figure in the hi&s;tory of the world,
fills many a page in the records of the Lake
of the four Cantons.</P>
<P>The earlie&s;t warlike atchievement of Ger|&s;au
appears to have been directed again&s;t
Lucerne. Di&s;contented with a deci&s;ion
given by the Canton of Zug, as arbitrator,
in favour of the Lucernois, the Ger&s;ovians,
like Homer's heroes, began ho&s;tilities by
&s;tealing the cattle of their neighbours of
Wigis,
<Q><L>&startq;When from their fury fled the trembling &s;wains,</L>
<L>And theirs was all the plunder of the plains;</L>
<L>Fifty white flocks, full fifty herds of &s;wine,</L>
<L>As many goats, as many lowing kine.&endq;</L></Q>
<BIBL>POPE'S ILIAD, Book xi.</BIBL>
Repri&s;als were made, and the conte&s;t might
perhaps have been as bloody as that of the
<PB N="138" REF="157">
Pylian Sage with the Epian powers, had
not the allied Cantons interfered, and im|po&s;ed
a heavy retribution on the Ger&s;o|vians.</P>
<P>This republic, which is &s;aid to be the
lea&s;t in Switzerland, and perhaps in Eu|rope,
and is &s;carcely known beyond the ken
of the craggs, and the lake that &s;urround
it, far from furni&s;hing us with new themes
of the happine&s;s and &s;ecurity of &s;uch hum|ble
&s;tates, bore many marks of the vices
and defects of more exten&s;ive governments.
A few hand&s;ome man&s;ions, &s;urrounded by
wretched cabins, and infe&s;ted by beggars,
afforded no pre&s;umptive evidence of an
equal di&s;tribution of power or wealth. The
republic of Ger&s;au, however, has &s;ome|times
had the honour of holding the ba|lance
of Swi&s;s power, and is &s;aid at the
famous battle of Cappel, in which Zuin|glius
fell, to have turned the &s;cale in favour
<PB N="139" REF="158">
of the cau&s;e for which they fought, and to
have been one of the principal in&s;truments
in the pre&s;ervation of the Catholic Religion
in Switzerland.</P>
<P>After having vi&s;ited whatever was wor|thy
of notice at Ger&s;au, we reimbarked and
proceeded on our voyage. The Canton of
Schweitz lay in the direction we were &s;ail|ing,
pre&s;enting us with a fine per&s;pective
of woody and romantic country, ri&s;ing from
&s;loping hills, on the &s;ide of which the town
of Schweitz is built, into lofty fore&s;ts of
pines, which are crowned by two towering
mountains with &s;harp pointed peaks. The
town of Brunnen is the port of this Can|ton,
and the road from thence to Schweitz,
about two miles di&s;tance, is an agreeable
walk, which is u&s;ually taken by every tra|veller
who &s;ails up this lake; &s;ince few re|fu&s;e
to turn a little out of their way in order
<PB N="140" REF="159">
to tread upon the &s;pot which gives its name
to Switzerland.</P>
<P>The &s;hores of the Lake of the four Can|tons
have witne&s;&s;ed mo&s;t of the great actions
that have been performed in Switzerland;
as tho&s;e of the Mediterranean have been the
&s;cenes of whatever has mo&s;t dignified the hi&s;|tory
of the world. At Brunen, in 1315,
the treaty was confirmed between the coun|tries
of Uri, Schweitz, and Underwalden,
which a&s;&s;erted their independence. At
Grutlen, a village at the foot of the Seeli&s;|burg,
on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the lake, was
held the confederacy where the generous
de&s;ign was planned by the three heroes for
the deliverance of their country. The
chapel of William Tell, as we advanced,
pre&s;ents it&s;elf on the right, perched among
the rocks, in commemoration of his e&s;cape
from the bailiff Gei&s;ler, by leaping from
<PB N="141" REF="160">
the boat in the mid&s;t of a tempe&s;t rai&s;ed by
&s;ubterraneous winds, which often render
this navigation dangerous.</P>
<P>No place could &s;urely be found more
corre&s;pondent to a great and generous pur|po&s;e,
more worthy of an heroical and &s;ub|lime
action, than the augu&s;t and &s;olemn
&s;cenery around us. The Lake which we
had traver&s;ed nearly from we&s;t to ea&s;t,
turns direct from the point oppo&s;ite Brunen
to the &s;outh, and is &s;aid to be in this part
&s;ix or &s;even hundred feet deep. This
branch is called the Lake of Uri. Near its
entrance in&s;ulated pointed rocks of &s;ingular
form and con&s;truction ri&s;e boldly from the
water. Having pa&s;&s;ed tho&s;e precipices, we
entered into a gulph, of which the boun|daries
were awfully terrific. On each &s;ide
of the profound aby&s;s, the dark lowering
rocks ro&s;e &s;ometimes abrupt, and barren,
&s;ometimes pre&s;enting tufts of pine and
<PB N="142" REF="161">
beech between its &s;haggy ma&s;&s;es, and occa|&s;ionally
beyond the&s;e &s;avage limits of the
lake, the eye caught a glimp&s;e of moun|tains
in the lofty per&s;pective, clothed mid|way
with fore&s;ts, and ri&s;ing into peaks of
alternate pa&s;turage and craggs.</P>
<P>Beneath their inacce&s;&s;ible ramparts, who&s;e
enormous height gives an appearance of
narrowne&s;s to the lake, we &s;ailed, gazing
with that kind of rapt a&s;toni&s;hment which
fears to di&s;turb, or be di&s;turbed by the mu|tual
communication of thought. The ap|proach
of night &s;pread new forms of &s;ha|dowy
greatne&s;s over the &s;cene. We had
loitered many hours on our pa&s;&s;age, forget|ting
that the la&s;t part of our voyage was
the mo&s;t perilous. But the unruffled &s;till|ne&s;s
of the water, the delicious &s;erenity of
the evening, and the long reflected rays of
the moon from the whitened &s;ummits of the
oppo&s;ite mountains, of which we &s;ometimes
<PB N="143" REF="162">
caught a glimp&s;e, di&s;&s;ipated every idea of
danger. The only &s;ounds that broke the
awful &s;ilence were the gentle motion of the
oars of our wearied boatmen, and the toll|ing
of the di&s;tant bell from Altorf, borne
down the lake, and
<Q>&startq;Swinging &s;low with &s;ullen roar.&endq;</Q>
<BIBL>MILTON.</BIBL></P>
<P>We had pa&s;&s;ed through all the &s;oft grada|tions
of twilight, and had enjoyed the
browne&s;t horrors of evening in all their
deepening gloom, before the moon had
&s;caled the lofty &s;ummits which concealed
her from our view. At length &s;he bur&s;t
upon us in her fulle&s;t radiancy, illumining
the du&s;ky &s;ides of the cragged rocks, and
the dark foliage of the piny woods; bur|ni&s;hing
with her &s;ilver rays the &s;mooth
and limpid waters; &s;hooting her &s;hadowy
beams along the lake to the di&s;tant per&s;pec|tive
<PB N="144" REF="163">
of the mountains we had left behind;
and lighting up the whole maje&s;tic &s;cenery
with glorious and cha&s;tened lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>We reached almo&s;t with regret Fluellen,
the port whither we were bound, and
mounting our hor&s;es proceeded to Altorf,
which lies at the di&s;tance of two miles.</P>

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING our impa|tience
to climb St. Gothard, it would have
been unpardonable not to have pa&s;&s;ed a few
hours in contemplating the mo&s;t remarkable
objects at Altorf, the capital of Uri, and
the laurelled cradle of the Helvetic confede|ration.</P>
<P>Two hundred years &s;ince, the tree yet
&s;tood erect in the market-place, to which
the &s;on of William Tell was bound. On
this &s;acred &s;pot is built a kind of painted
tower, and at &s;ome little di&s;tance, where it
is &s;aid the father &s;tood, when he &s;hot the
apple from his &s;on's head, a public foun|tain
<PB N="146" REF="165">
is erected, called Tell's fountain; on
which is placed the frowning &s;tatue of this
generous deliverer of his country. There
mu&s;t &s;urely be &s;ome defect in the heart,
which feels no enthu&s;ia&s;tic glow, while we
tread over the &s;pots where tho&s;e heroes have
trod, who have &s;truggled for the liber|ties
of mankind, or bled for their rights.
Yet one of that everla&s;ting race of doubters,
who wage an eternal war with all tho&s;e
&s;ublime traditions, tho&s;e heroical &s;acrifices,
and tho&s;e deeds of greatne&s;s, which it is
delightful to believe, has de&s;troyed with a
touch of his &s;terile pen all the bright im|ages
with which imagination peoples this
&s;cene of marvels, by a&s;&s;erting in a treati&s;e,
publi&s;hed thirty years &s;ince at Berne, that
all the romantic feats of William Tell were
in far remoter times performed by Toko, a
Dane, again&s;t Harold, a king of Denmark,
in the tenth century. This cold inquirer
was probably not aware of all the di&s;agree|able
<PB N="147" REF="166">
&s;en&s;ations, which would be felt by en|thu&s;ia&s;tic
travellers, who had been wor&s;hip|ping
the &s;tatue of Tell, when they were in|formed
that their homage &s;hould be ad|dre&s;&s;ed
to Toko. It is indeed pretended that
there is an unfortunate co-incidence of cir|cum&s;tances
in the narration of the Dani&s;h
hi&s;torian, with re&s;pect to the &s;hooting at
the apple, and the &s;peech made to the
tyrant. The &s;overeign council of Berne,
however, ordered the book to be burnt, and
I feel much inclined to excu&s;e this coercive
mea&s;ure of tho&s;e pui&s;&s;ant Lords, &s;ince I
cannot but &s;hare their re&s;entment. Tell is
in England, as well as Switzerland, the
hero of our infancy; the marvellous tale of
the apple is one of our earlie&s;t le&s;&s;ons, and
who can endure to give to Toko tho&s;e tro|phies,
which he has been taught from child|hood
were the rights of Tell! The only
circum&s;tance in the Saxon's favor, or rather
that of the author who cites him; is the mo|de&s;ty
<PB N="148" REF="167">
with which he delivers his doubts:
had he lived in our days, he would, per|haps,
have allegorized William Tell and
Toko him&s;elf, with as little ceremony as
M. Dupuis, and his le&s;s learned pupils in
infidelity, have allegorized the mo&s;t &s;acred
characters of antiquity. The fanta&s;tic &s;pe|culations
of the&s;e later Pyrrhoni&s;ts have in|deed
been treated with more &s;everity than
the fable of the Hi&s;torian. The political in|fallibility
of a &s;overeign council may per|haps
be arraigned, and Rou&s;&s;eau &s;ugge&s;ts,
&startq;that burning is not an&s;wering;&endq; but who
&s;hall rai&s;e up the whim&s;ical tribe of Alle|gori&s;ts,
cru&s;hed beneath the logical wit of
the philo&s;ophical believer?</P>
<P>After leaving Altorf, we journeyed along
a valley of three leagues, through which the
Reu&s;s flows with the ordinary rapidity of a
Swi&s;s river.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="168">
About &s;ix miles from Altorf, we pa&s;&s;ed
by a chapel in a meadow; the fa&ccedil;ade of
which was decorated with a highly co|loured
painting, repre&s;enting a &s;tag-hunt,
which appeared to be a &s;ingular ornament
for a place of religious wor&s;hip. We found
upon inquiry, that this meadow was one
of the places of general a&s;&s;embly, that
it was called the Jag-Matt, or hunting mea|dow;
and that on the day of St. Mark the
whole country march to this chapel in pro|ce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The rocks, clothed at intervals with trees
of various &s;orts ro&s;e high and &s;teep on each
&s;ide of the valley, which wore a fertile and
&s;miling appearance till we came to the vil|lage
of Stag; above which the Alps fir&s;t
lift their maje&s;tic heads. Here we began to
a&s;cend that ma&s;s of mountains, which is ra|ther
the ba&s;e than the mountain it&s;elf of St.
Gothard. The road &s;uddenly becomes &s;o
<PB N="150" REF="169">
&s;teep, that it required at fir&s;t &s;ome addre&s;s
to keep a &s;eat on hor&s;eback. The river,
which glided gently through the valley on
its expanded bed, being now hemmed in by
rocks, begins to &s;truggle for its pa&s;&s;age at a
profound depth. The pine clad-hills ro&s;e
on each &s;ide to our farthe&s;t ken, down
which torrent &s;treams were ru&s;hing, and
cro&s;&s;ed our way to mingle them&s;elves with
the Reu&s;s, which continually pre&s;ented new
&s;cenes of wonder. The mountains &s;eemed
to clo&s;e upon us as we advanced, &s;ometimes
but ju&s;t &s;pace enough was left to admit the
pa&s;&s;age of the river foaming through the
rocks, which &s;eem ob&s;tinately to oppo&s;e its
pa&s;&s;age. The road lay for a con&s;iderable
length on the left &s;ide of the precipices, from
which we beheld the &s;truggles of the wa|ters,
and the tremendous &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ca&s;|cades
which they formed. An abrupt pre|cipice,
forbidding the continuance of the
road on this &s;ide, a bridge of hardy con&s;truc|tion
<PB N="151" REF="170">
led to the oppo&s;ite mountain, which is
a&s;cended, till meeting with a &s;imilar ob|&s;truction,
we cro&s;&s;ed the &s;tream again to
the left.</P>
<P>On one of the&s;e bridges, we halted to
gaze upon the &s;cene around us, and the
yawning gulph below. The depth is &s;o
tremendous, that the fir&s;t emotion, in look|ing
over the bridge is that of terror, le&s;t the
&s;ide &s;hould fall away and plunge you into
the dark aby&s;s; and it requires &s;ome reflec|tion
to calm the painful turbulence of &s;ur|prize,
and leave the mind the full indulg|ence
of the &s;en&s;ations of &s;olemn enthu&s;ia&s;tic
delight, which &s;well the heart, while we
contemplate &s;uch &s;tupendous objects.</P>
<P>The name of this bridge, in the language
of the country, is the Prie&s;t's leap; whether
the holy man leapt over the gulph, or into
it, is not remembered, but it is difficult to

&s;hudder, or fancy your&s;elf in per|fect

<P>The road up to the village of Wa&s;&s;en is
highly romantic: here the indu&s;try of men
has tamed &s;ome of tho&s;e wild torrents, of
which &s;uch numbers run idly to wa&s;te; and
&s;awing mills and other machinery owe
their impul&s;e to tho&s;e &s;wiftly de&s;cending
volumes. In this village we halted to re|po&s;e
from our fatigues, and began to feel
&s;ome of the mountain breezes which con|tra&s;ted
very agreeably with the concentrated
heat that had &s;ubdued us in the valley be|neath.
It was Sunday, the day was fine,
and the village was crouded with the moun|taineers
<PB N="153" REF="172">
who had come in to keep the fe&s;ti|val,
and practi&s;e, as they do every week in
&s;ome village of the Canton, the art of
&s;hooting at a mark, which, independent of
the amu&s;ement, is a duty impo&s;ed on every
citizen, who, under the in&s;pection of a ma|gi&s;trate,
is obliged in the cour&s;e of the year
to fire a certain number of rounds, that he
may keep his arms in order, and not forget
the means of defending his country in ca&s;e
of inva&s;ion. We could yet &s;ee no traces of
&s;now, except in the numerous torrents which
rolled down the enormous mountains, the
&s;treams of which were con&s;iderably in|crea&s;ed
from a cau&s;e that in le&s;s mountain|ous
countries would have produced an oppo|&s;ite
effect, the exce&s;&s;ive heat and dryne&s;s of
the weather, which melted the &s;nows of the
Glaciers.</P>
<P>The views around Wa&s;&s;en are a&s;toni&s;h|ing
for their variety as well as beauty. You
<PB N="154" REF="173">
perceive, however, after pa&s;&s;ing the village,
that you are advancing into a country where
man is obliged to be continually at war
with nature. On one &s;ide the mountain
was &s;tripped of its piny clothing to &s;ome
extent, di&s;covering, in&s;tead of dark green
foliage, a bare rocky and gravelly wa&s;te, in|ter&s;per&s;ed
with wrecks of trees. This, we
were told, was the ravage of an avalanche.
When whole fore&s;ts of maje&s;tic height are
&s;wept away with irre&s;i&s;tible fury, what
means of defence can human force oppo&s;e
to &s;uch mighty de&s;truction? Men, how|ever,
live tranquilly amid&s;t the danger, and
build their hou&s;es in &s;uch po&s;itions, and af|ter
&s;uch a con&s;truction, that the enemy,
even if he chances to take the direction of
their habitations, may pa&s;s over them un|hurt.</P>
<P>Rocks, for the mo&s;t part, are made their
allies again&s;t the&s;e inva&s;ions from the &s;nowy
<PB N="155" REF="174">
mountains; but even rocks, coeval with
time, often yield to the terrible deva&s;tation.
As we advanced, the country, which had
hitherto pre&s;ented &s;cenes of blended grace
and maje&s;ty, began to a&s;&s;ume an a&s;pect of
&s;avage wildne&s;s and terror. A few habita|tions
and green &s;pots amid&s;t the&s;e de&s;erts,
gave &s;till &s;ome relief to the piece; but after
pa&s;&s;ing the little village of Ge&s;tinen, and
the torrent of the Meyen which cro&s;&s;es the
road to increa&s;e the waters of the Reu&s;s, all
is tremendous and awful. Here no pines
wave their lofty heads, no mountain &s;hrubs
di&s;play their &s;imple flowrets, nor does even
a blade of weed betray the po&s;&s;ibility of ex|i&s;tence
to any thing that breathes.</P>
<P>It was now the mo&s;t luxuriant part of
&s;ummer; we had left the glowing harve&s;ts
beneath ripe for the &s;ickle, and the fruits at
two or three leagues di&s;tance hung in la|vi&s;h
clu&s;ters upon the bough; but in this
<PB N="156" REF="175">
region it not only was winter, but a winter
that &s;eemed here to have fixed its eternal
abode; for not only were there no traces of
renovation to in&s;pire hope, but the impo&s;&s;i|bility
of change was every where obdurately
marked. Immen&s;e piles of naked rock,
not le&s;s lofty than the mountains along
which we pa&s;&s;ed, ro&s;e &s;ometimes perpendi|cularly
above our heads, and &s;ometimes fall|ing
back, left between the road and their
horrid tops immen&s;e ma&s;&s;es that &s;eemed
&s;hivered from their &s;ides, forming va&s;t fields
of rock.</P>
<P>This pa&s;&s;age, which in &s;ummer is &s;uffici|ciently
terrific, becomes dangerous in win|ter
by the frequent avalanches that ru&s;h
from tho&s;e tremendous heights, and &s;o de|licately
are the&s;e me&s;&s;engers of de&s;truction
hung on the &s;ummits, that the guides and
mule-drivers tye up the bells of their cattle
to prevent the gingling, and forbid a word
<PB N="157" REF="176">
to be &s;poken by the pa&s;&s;engers, that the ava|lanche,
which waits on the mountain to
overwhelm them, may not hear them ap|proach.
Little cro&s;&s;es placed by the road
&s;ide where travellers have peri&s;hed, are me|lancholy
mementos of &s;uch mortal accidents,
again&s;t which, however, precautions are
taken, by firing mu&s;kets to &s;hake the air
and precipitate the impending avalanche.
Huge fragments of rocks &s;ometimes pre&s;ent
them&s;elves as if they threatened to ob&s;truct
the way; and we remarked one enormous
piece of beautiful granite that &s;kirted the
road, and is called the devil's &s;tone, which,
on account of &s;ome mi&s;under&s;tanding with
the people of the country, he brought down
from the mountain to de&s;troy &s;ome of the
works he had him&s;elf formerly con|&s;tructed.</P>
<P>If any &s;uper&s;tition is pardonable, it is
that of the inhabitants of this mountain,
<PB N="158" REF="177">
and had the epic poets from Homer, down
to our &s;ublime Milton, &s;een this valley of
Schellinen before they de&s;cribed their Tar|tarus
or Pandemonium, they would have
caught &s;ome new images of the &s;avage and
terrific, and their hells would have been ha|bitations
le&s;s de&s;irable.</P>
<P>The devil of this country, however,
cannot, in the e&s;timation of the rude moun|taineers,
be the &s;ame malignant mi&s;chievous
fiend which the inhabitants of plains and ci|vilized
countries make him, &s;ince, if he has
cho&s;en this chaos of nature for his habita|tion,
he has not &s;hut up his palace, like
other &s;tately monarchs, from the vulgar eye,
but, on the contrary, has unfolded the re|ce&s;&s;es
of his dwelling by opening ways,
and building bridges, which the moun|taineers
believe none but him&s;elf could have
con&s;tructed, and by which he has certainly
&startq;de&s;erved well of the country.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="178">
Nothing can be imagined more bold and
daring than the road that leads through the
valley of Schellenen to the mountain of St.
Gothard; the difficulties appear almo&s;t in|&s;urmountable;
&s;ometimes the road &s;eems
&s;o narrow between frightful precipices on
each &s;ide, that great blocks of granite are
placed on the edges as &s;afeguards to the
pa&s;&s;engers; and where the mountain forbids
all po&s;&s;ibility of pa&s;&s;age, offering an impe|netrable
rampart by its vertical abruptne&s;s,
the path juts out from the &s;ide &s;upported
by arches and pillars, which are built up
from &s;ome &s;alient points of the ma&s;s be|neath,
and &s;eems &startq;a ridge of pendant
rock over the vexed aby&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P>This road, the breadth of which differs
according to the facility of con&s;truction, is
in &s;ome places from twelve to fifteen feet
wide, and in others only ten, leaving in
general &s;pace enough for loaded mules to
<PB N="160" REF="179">
pa&s;s each other; it is paved the greate&s;t
part of the way with granite, and is com|pared,
by Mr. Raymond, to a ribband
thrown negligently over the mountains.</P>
<P>After winding for &s;ome time among
the&s;e awful &s;cenes, of which no painting
can give an adequate de&s;cription, and of
which an imagination the mo&s;t pregnant in
&s;ublime horrors could form but a very im|perfect
idea, we came within the &s;ound of
the&s;e cataracts of the Reu&s;s which an|nounced
our approach towards another ope|ration
of Satanic power, called the Devil's
Bridge. We were more &s;truck with the
augu&s;t drapery of this &s;upernatural work,
than with the work it&s;elf. It &s;eemed le&s;s
marvellous than expectation had pictured it,
and we were perhaps the more di&s;appoint|ed,
as we remembered that &startq;the wonder|ous
art pontifical,&endq; was a part of architecture
with which his infernal maje&s;ty was per|fectly
<PB N="161" REF="180">
well acquainted; and the rocks of
the valley of Schellenen were certainly as
&s;olid foundations for bridge building as
&startq;the aggregated &s;oil &s;olid, or &s;limy,&endq;
which was collected amid&s;t the wa&s;te of
chaos, and crouded drove &startq;from each &s;ide
&s;hoaling towards the mouth of hell<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t, Book x.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>On this &s;pot we loitered for &s;ome time to
contemplate the &s;tupendous and terrific &s;ce|nery.
The mountainous rocks lifted their
heads abrupt, and appeared to fix the limits
of our progre&s;s at this point, unle&s;s we
could climb the mighty torrent which was
&s;truggling impetuou&s;ly for pa&s;&s;age under
our feet, after precipitating its afflicted wa|ters
with tremendous roar in &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ca&s;|cades
over the disjointed rocks, and filling
the atmo&s;phere with its foam.</P>
<P>Separating our&s;elves with reluctance
<PB N="162" REF="181">
from the&s;e objects of overwhelming great|ne&s;s,
we turned an angle of the mountain at
the end of the bridge, and proceeded along
a way of difficult a&s;cent, which led to a
rock that &s;eemed inflexibly to bar our pa&s;|&s;age.
A bridge fa&s;tened to this rock by
iron work, and &s;u&s;pended over the torrent,
was formerly the only means of pa&s;&s;ing,
but numerous accidents led the government
to &s;eek another outlet. The rock being too
high to climb, and too weighty to remove,
the engineer took the middle way, and
bored a hole in the &s;olid ma&s;s two hundred
feet long, and about ten or twelve feet
broad and high, through which he carried
the road, The entrance into this &s;ubterra|neous
pa&s;&s;age is almo&s;t dark, and the little
light that penetrates through a crevice in the
rock, &s;erves only to make its ob&s;curity
more vi&s;ible. Filled with powerful images
of the terrible and &s;ublime, from the enor|mous
objects which I had been contemplat|ing
<PB N="163" REF="182">
for &s;ome hours pa&s;t, objects, the forms
of which were new to my imagination, it
was not without a feeling of reluctance that
I plunged into this &s;cene of night, who&s;e
thick gloom heightened every &s;en&s;ation of
terror.</P>
<P>After pa&s;&s;ing through this cavern, the
view which &s;uddenly unfolded it&s;elf ap|peared
rather a gay illu&s;ion of the fancy
than real nature. No magical wand was
ever fabled to &s;hift more in&s;tantaneou&s;ly the
&s;cene, or call up forms of more &s;triking
contra&s;t to tho&s;e on which we had gazed.
On the other &s;ide of the cavern we &s;eemed
amid&s;t the chaos or the overthrow of nature;
on this we beheld her dre&s;t in all the love|line&s;s
of infancy or renovation, with every
charm of &s;oft and tranquil beauty. The
rugged and &s;tony inter&s;tices between the
mountain and the road were here changed
into &s;mooth and verdant paths; the abrupt
<PB N="164" REF="183">
precipice and &s;hagged rock were metamor|pho&s;ed
into gently &s;loping declivities; the
barren and monotonous de&s;ert was trans|formed
into a fertile and &s;miling plain. The
long re&s;ounding cataract, &s;truggling through
the huge ma&s;&s;es of granite, here be|came
a calm and limpid current, gliding
over fine beds of &s;and with gentle mur|murs,
as if reluctant to leave that enchant|ing
abode.</P>
<P>Near the middle of this delicious valley,
called the Vale of Ur&s;eren, is the village of
In-der-Malt, which appeared to have been
lately built: behind it was a &s;mall fore&s;t of
pine trees, which are pre&s;erved with &s;o
much care as a rampart again&s;t the ava|lanches,
that the &s;acred wood was not held
more inviolate; and we were told, that the
profanation of the axe on this palladium
would be followed with the death of the
&s;acrilegious offender.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="184">
One of my fellow travellers ob&s;erved,
that this valley, which is three miles in
length, and two in breadth, had, according
to every appearance, been originally a lake;
for which he adduced many mineralogical
rea&s;ons; and that the drying up of the lake
was occa&s;ioned by &s;ome violent fraction at
the bottom of the valley, which drained the
water off from the land, leaving it in its
pre&s;ent form. Every part of the valley bore
marks of high cultivation, if that term can
be applied to the culture of meadow lands,
where we &s;aw herds of cattle grazing. One
production indeed, e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary for a
country &s;o elevated, was wanting; although
the day had $word$ uncommonly beautiful and
&s;erene, and the &s;un &s;hed its &s;ofte&s;t rays
where we entered this valley, yet the &s;nows
on the higher mountains, and our feelings,
when at the clo&s;e of the evening we reached
the village of the Ho&s;pital, at the oppo&s;ite
&s;ide of the valley, reminded us that the
<PB N="166" REF="185">
mo&s;t acceptable offering our ho&s;t could
make us was, one of tho&s;e bundles of wood
which the villagers are obliged to bring up
with great labor and expence from the
mountains beneath.</P>
<P>According to popular tradition, this val|ley
was not always &s;o unprovided with this
article of fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ity: the mountaineers
are per&s;uaded that their hills were once co|vered
with fore&s;ts, but that &s;ome magician
who dwelt higher up the mountain, or in
&s;ome other place, le&s;s a paradi&s;e than their
own, not only burnt their woods, but &s;o
bound the &s;oil with potent &s;pells, that it has
ever &s;ince been incapable of producing trees.
The magician could not have exhibited a
more mi&s;chievous &s;pecimen of his art to
the inhabitants of this valley. Time might
indeed have repaired the conflagration, but
what exorci&s;m &s;hall re&s;tore fertility to the
enchanted &s;oil! Some writers conjecture
<PB N="167" REF="186">
that the wood in this valley was con&s;umed
by accident; and that trees grew no
more on the &s;pot, becau&s;e the winds which
&s;weep irre&s;i&s;tibly over the heights tear up
the young plants before they can take root,
being un&s;heltered by old trees. The greater
part of the vallies of Switzerland, it is ob|&s;erved,
wear the &s;ame appearance; the &s;oil
occa&s;ionally gives way; the trees on the
higher ground lo&s;e their footing and &s;lide
down; tho&s;e which grow beneath them
being no longer &s;heltered are torn up by
winds; and &s;now which then accumulates
without oppo&s;ition on the heights, where
tho&s;e fore&s;ts &s;tood, melting at the return of
&s;pring, overwhelms the hills with torrents,
dragging away the vegetable earth, and
leaving the mountain a &s;keleton, unfit for
pa&s;turage, or precipitating it&s;elf in the form
of avalanches, de&s;troys every thing in its
cour&s;e&punc;</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="187">
This valley is under the protection, or
rather &s;ubject to the Canton of Uri. It for|merly
made part of the Empire, but the
Abbot of Di&s;ertis, in the Gri&s;ons, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
various &s;eignorial rights. The hou&s;e of
Au&s;tria di&s;po&s;ed of its prefecture in the
beginning of the fourteenth century, to
Henri de L'Ho&s;pital, a gentleman of Uri,
from whom it was afterwards forcibly
transferred, as hi&s;torians tell us, to Conrad
de Moos, another gentleman of the &s;ame
country. The pa&s;&s;age through this valley
had often been the &s;ubject of contention.
At one time the inhabitants, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the
Abbot, made war on their neighbours of
Uri; at another, aided by their former op|ponents
and two other neighbouring Can|tons,
they cro&s;&s;ed St. Gothard to fight with
their pre&s;ent fellow &s;ubjects, the inha|bitants
of the Levantine. Various other di&s;|putes
having ari&s;en between the inhabitants
and the Abbot, which always terminated in
<PB N="169" REF="188">
blood&s;hed, the people who had been indebt|ed
to their allies of Uri, for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance
in the pre&s;ervation of their liberties, &s;uc|ceeded
in the beginning of the fifteenth cen|tury
in a negociation with the Canton, and
relieved them&s;elves for ever of the trouble
of taking any farther care of their own
privileges, by putting them under the di|rection
of their more powerful neighbours,
with a re&s;erve, however, of municipal
rights, &s;uch as the election of their ma|gi&s;trates,
and the trial of civil and criminal
cau&s;es, &s;ubject to the revi&s;ion of the Can|ton
of Uri.</P>
<P>The valley contains two other villages,
be&s;ides the&s;e already mentioned; and they
are the highe&s;t &s;ocial habitations in Europe.
The eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs of the valley are
under the direction of the Bi&s;hop of Coire,
nor has the late revolution interrupted this
&s;piritual intercour&s;e. Formerly the inhabi|tants
<PB N="170" REF="189">
cho&s;e their prie&s;ts &s;ubject to the con|firmation
of the bi&s;hop, and the Abbot
of Di&s;entis, but of late the admini&s;trator
in holy things is a Capuchin of the Can|ton.</P>

<P>WE pa&s;&s;ed the night at the village of Ho&s;|pital,
and the next morning pur&s;ued our
journey, beginning from hence to a&s;cend
what is properly the mountain of St. Go|thard.
The &s;cene no longer exhibited the
&s;avage horrors of the chaos we had traver&s;ed
the preceding day; the road was neither
extremely rapid or dangerous; every where
we beheld vegetation, and the mountain
myrtle, the white hellebore, and other
&s;hrubs, indigenous to high regions, were in
their bloom. The Reu&s;s had now &s;unk
into a rivulet, being no longer fed, as below,
by the numerous &s;treams that a&s;&s;emble their
waters from the hills on each &s;ide Ur&s;eren;
&s;ometimes it pre&s;ented a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of fanci|ful
<PB N="172" REF="191">
ca&s;cades, acro&s;s which one might leap
without apprehen&s;ion, even if the foot
&s;hould &s;lip in the enterpri&s;e. We had been
much affected during the night with cold,
and concluded that we had more to &s;uffer
before we gained the &s;ummit; but exerci&s;e
and the enlivening &s;un-beams bani&s;hed a
&s;en&s;ation &s;o new, after having the preceding
day felt the heats of July in the valley of
Altorf.</P>
<P>We hitherto found that we had in|dulged
a vain expectation of enjoying, from
tho&s;e lofty heights, va&s;t and picture&s;que
views of the countries beneath; &s;ince we
had nearly attained what is called the top of
St. Gothard, and had yet &s;een no object that
was more remote than the di&s;tance of two
leagues. If we looked forward, there ap|peard
nothing but the mountain which we
had to climb, and which, having a&s;cended,
was &s;ucceeded by another. When we looked
<PB N="173" REF="192">
back, the mountain we had left was the
only object which pre&s;ented it&s;elf, and on
either &s;ide our view was confined by the&s;e
wooded precipices, through which, the pre|ceding
morning, we had winded our way.
Between Ur&s;eren and the &s;ummit of St. Go|thard,
amid&s;t piles of rocks which &s;eemed
to forbid all ken beyond, we were, how|ever,
gratified with one of tho&s;e bur&s;ts
through an opening to the north, which
di&s;played in rich &s;ucce&s;&s;ion the &s;ummits of
all the mountains we had pa&s;&s;ed, and others
at an immen&s;e di&s;tance, &s;ome gilded by &s;un|&s;hine,
and &s;ome enveloped by clouds rolling
like a troubled ocean far beneath.</P>
<P>Although the &s;un poured its noon-tide
rays, we perceived that we were a&s;cending
into regions of fro&s;t, from the appearance,
or rather the ab&s;ence, of vegetation. The
luxuriant pa&s;ture of the valley was &s;ucceed|ed
by a coar&s;e &s;piral gra&s;s, which now gave
<PB N="174" REF="193">
way to mo&s;s, or the bare rock, and a &s;oli|tary
and &s;tunted &s;hrub &s;ometimes protrud|ing
it&s;elf, &s;eemed to mark, not &s;o much
the barrenne&s;s of the &s;oil, as the pro&s;crip|tion
of vegetable life.</P>
<P>We at length attained the &s;ummit of St.
Gothard, and were &s;aluted on our arrival at
the convent by a courteous monk, who
came out to welcome us, and invite to take
refre&s;hments. During three or four months
in the year the&s;e Capuchins &s;pend their
time agreeably enough, and probably there
is no &s;pot half &s;o far out of the reach of the
habitable globe, where &s;o much variety of
amu&s;ement is to be found. Every &s;ucce&s;|&s;ive
gue&s;t has much to inquire or impart,
and here above the world the&s;e hermits have
many opportunities of witne&s;&s;ing the whim|&s;ies
and follies with which it abounds.
They informed us, that the day before our
arrival a numerous retinue of hor&s;es, oxen,
<PB N="175" REF="194">
mules, and other cattle, had pa&s;&s;ed in the
&s;uite of a great man, who&s;e carriage they had
dragged, by his order, from the bottom of
the mountain, that he might have the &s;ame
of cro&s;&s;ing St. Gothard in a vehicle with
wheels. As our countrymen are known to
be the only travelling philo&s;ophers, who
make experiments of this kind, the Monks
had no difficulty in conjecturing on the ap|proach
of this long proce&s;&s;ion, that if it
was not the Emperor, or the burgo-ma&s;ter
of Berne, the two greate&s;t per&s;onages they had
heard of, it mu&s;t be an Engli&s;h Lord; and
they were not mi&s;taken in their conjecture;
it proved to be an Engli&s;h Lord, who, for
the rea&s;ons above-mentioned, had run the
ri&s;k of breaking his neck in his mountain
gig, over precipices, which he might have
traver&s;ed without danger on hor&s;eback, or
if he could not ride, in a litter. A tragical
effect of this &s;ort of temerity had happened
&s;ome time before to another young Engli&s;h
<PB N="176" REF="195">
nobleman, who, although repeatedly warned
by his tutors, that if he attempted to &s;wim
down the cataracts of the Rhine, near Rhin|felden,
he would inevitably be da&s;hed to
pieces, made the fatal experiment, and
peri&s;hed with his companion on the rocks.</P>
<P>In the winter the intercour&s;e of the&s;e
fathers is confined chiefly to the muleteers,
who, at all &s;ea&s;ons, traver&s;e the&s;e mountains
in &s;pite of &s;nows and avalanches. Here the
poor traveller, beaten by the tempe&s;ts, finds
repo&s;e and nouri&s;hment; nor do the Monks
demand, even of the wealthy pa&s;&s;enger, any
recompence for the courte&s;ies they be&s;tow.
Every thing that their hou&s;e affords is &s;et
before him with cheerfulne&s;s; and he
u&s;ually returns the ho&s;pitality, by leaving
on his departure a piece of money under his
plate, in order to provide for the relief of
travellers, le&s;s fortunate than him&s;elf. But
the&s;e pious fathers chiefly maintain this be|nevolent

<P>The name of Gothard was given to this
mountain, according to hi&s;torians, before
the e&s;tabli&s;hment of Chri&s;tianity, from the
Deity wor&s;hipped there, who was &s;tiled, as
the name imports, the God of the &s;ummit,
or God over all: the canonization of the
mountain did not take place till the twelfth
century, when Pope Innocent the &s;econd
made the mountain a &s;aint, and, with ro|man
policy, chained the god of the van|qui&s;hed
faith to the car of Chri&s;tian tri|umphs.

as idolatry, yet &s;urely, if the temple, which
be&s;t delights the Supreme Being, be a tem|ple
not made with hands, that which next
to the pure and innocent heart is mo&s;t
worthy of his &s;ublimity are the &s;ummits of
tho&s;e everla&s;ting mountains, the &s;aint but
neare&s;t re&s;emblance on earth of his un|changeablene&s;s
and eternity.</P>
<P>On the top of St. Gothard, one of the
mo&s;t elevated mountains of Europe, we had
once imagined the view into Italy on one
&s;ide, and over Switzerland on the other,
would reward all our toil; but this plat|form,
&s;o rai&s;ed above the level of the earth,
is only a deep valley, when compared with
the lateral mountains, and &s;kirting-piles of
rock that bound the view to this de&s;art,
diver&s;ified only by the habitation of the
<PB N="179" REF="198">
Capuchins, and the adjoining lakes. Had
we even been able to reach any of tho&s;e
rocky &s;ummits, which lie on either &s;ide,
we &s;hould have perceived only a chaos of
rocks and mountains beneath, with clouds
floating at their ba&s;es, concealing the re&s;t
from our view, and cliffs above covered
with untrodden &s;nows; for we were not
yet in the region of Glaciers; the eternal ice
impended far beyond; and we were told
that the mineralogi&s;ts, or tho&s;e who go in
&s;earch of cry&s;tal, which is found in con|&s;iderable
quantities in tho&s;e mountains, are
the only per&s;ons who expo&s;e them&s;elves to
the danger of climbing the&s;e tremendous
precipices. At a little di&s;tance from the
Ho&s;pice, we pa&s;&s;ed three or four lakes, each
about a quarter of a mile long, and of great
depth. The&s;e lakes are the &s;ources of the
Reu&s;s and the Te&s;&s;ino; one of tho&s;e rivers
joins the Po, and flows into the Adriatic,
the other makes one of the hundred &s;treams
<PB N="180" REF="199">
that &s;well the Rhine in its progre&s;s to the
German ocean.</P>
<P>In our rambles near the convent, we &s;aw
the remains of a mighty avalanche, which
had &s;o fallen as to form a magnificent
bridge over the torrent of the Te&s;&s;ino, the
waters having hollowed it below in &s;trug|gling
for a pa&s;&s;age; but its &s;urface had yet
re&s;i&s;ted all the attacks of the &s;ummer &s;un
beams, and &s;eemed as if plea&s;ed with its
new habitation, it had there fixed its abode
for ever. We walked over this icy bridge
to the other &s;ide of the torrent, and &s;ome
of my fellow travellers amu&s;ed them&s;elves
with a diver&s;ion not very common in the
middle of July, that of throwing &s;now|balls
at each other. The temperature of this
mountain, the monk told us, was at times
various, even in the &s;ame day; but more
con&s;tant in general than in the region be|neath.
Sometimes the Italian zephyr came
<PB N="181" REF="200">
over them with its genial influence, and
conveyed a tran&s;ient &s;en&s;ation of &s;ummer:
&s;ometimes they enjoyed clear &s;un-&s;hine on
the &s;ummit, when travellers arrived from
below drenched in rain; but it appeared
from the good man's narrative, that we
mu&s;t make a winter's &s;ojourn with him to
form any adequate idea of the pelting of
the pitile&s;s &s;torm during &s;ix or &s;even
months of the year.</P>
<P>We bade adieu to this courteous monk,
promi&s;ing our&s;elves the &s;atisfaction of
&s;pending a day with him on our return,
and began to de&s;cend the mountain on the
Italian &s;ide, which, though almo&s;t verti|cally
&s;teep, is rendered practicable by a
well paved road, formed along the &s;ide of
the mountain, and which, by its frequent
returns, brings the traveller without much
inconvenience to the ba&s;e. Although the
road was good, the declivity was too great
<PB N="182" REF="201">
to admit of our tru&s;ting our&s;elves on hor&s;e|back,
e&s;pecially as our hor&s;es had not been
accu&s;tomed to travel through &s;uch moun|tainous
countries. As we loitered down the
&s;teep, the mules we had left behind at the
convent overtook us, and we admired the
firmne&s;s with which they trod under their
heavy burdens. Mean while a numerous
caravan coming from Italy had begun to
a&s;cend the &s;ame precipice; and nothing
could be more picture&s;que than the waving
picture they pre&s;ented, as they moved along
the winding path.</P>
<P>I felt &s;ome apprehen&s;ion, that the meet|ing
of &s;uch a number of mules, with their
&s;ides di&s;tended by paniers or wine-ca&s;ks, in
&s;o narrow a road, mu&s;t be fatal at lea&s;t to
one divi&s;ion, which I expected to &s;ee tumb|ling
down the precipice from the &s;hock of
the other; but the&s;e animals, as if con&s;cious
of the danger, creep to the utmo&s;t verge of
<PB N="183" REF="202">
the road on either &s;ide, and pa&s;s each other
in long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion without the &s;lighte&s;t touch.</P>
<P>After de&s;cending a con&s;iderable way, we
turned to look back on the precipices we
had pa&s;&s;ed. High in air, at a remote di&s;tance,
we beheld the Te&s;&s;ino on the &s;ummit of the
mountain, ru&s;hing as from the &s;ky over the
perpendicular rock. The eye, after lo&s;ing
it for a moment, again catches its daring
torrent, rolling over a &s;econd precipice, now
interrupted in its fall by jutting fragments,
now &s;truggling down a declivity of de|tached
ma&s;&s;es, broken into various channels.
A while it vani&s;hes behind the angles of the
neighbouring mountains, then foreing its
pa&s;&s;age through a narrow confine of &s;tu|pendous
granite beneath, dilates and throws
it&s;elf in one broad foaming &s;heet over the
humbler rocks. Again lo&s;t, you &s;ee
it no more, till it pa&s;&s;es &s;ilently near
the &s;pot whence you gaze, in &s;oft di|vided
<PB N="184" REF="203">
&s;treams, that at length, uniting, roll
down in a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of regular
ca&s;cades, but little elevated one above the
other.</P>
<P>The country around, though barren from
its height, wears all the &s;mile of vegetation;
the mountains are lofty and romantic, but
le&s;s terrific as we de&s;cend; and &s;o little
dangerous are the precipices, that while we
were winding along the road, &s;ome of our
company amu&s;ed them&s;elves by climbing
upon the &s;ummits that &s;kirted it, and joined
us at a bridge with various &s;pecimens of
beautiful &s;tones which they had picked up
in their rambles. The&s;e mountains are
rich mines for mineralogi&s;ts. We had long
phy&s;ical di&s;qui&s;itions about quartz&punc; mica,
and &s;chorl, which not being perfectly intel|ligible
to me, I continued to gaze, with un|tired
delight, on the &s;cene around me, while
the&s;e naturali&s;ts marched off to examine
<PB N="185" REF="204">
whether an adjoining mountain had mo&s;t
&s;trata of white felt-&s;par or green granite.
Without much knowledge, however, in the
&s;cience of &s;tones and rocks, the traveller
cannot but ob&s;erve with admiration the di|ver&s;ities
of the&s;e inanimate objects as he
pa&s;&s;es along the road, which, in &s;ome places,
is &s;trewed with the&s;e variegated minerals,
and becomes re&s;plendent from the &s;hivers
of &s;parkling rock that are wa&s;hed down by
the &s;treams from the &s;ummit of the moun|tain.</P>
<P>Half way between the convent and the
fir&s;t Italian village, is a bridge over the
Te&s;&s;ino, which is &s;welled by a torrent that
joins it from a neighbouring precipice,
when the river, which for &s;ome time pa&s;t
had flowed tranquilly along, as if &s;uddenly
impelled by its new companion, re-a&s;&s;umes
its character of wildne&s;s, and ru&s;hes in di&s;|order
<PB N="186" REF="205">
over the rocks. Here vegetation again
&s;truggles into life; the under &s;hrubs lift
up their meek heads, the tu&s;ted ro&s;e of the
Alps and the mountain-myrtle wa&s;te their
&s;weetne&s;s on the de&s;art &s;cene, and dwarf
larch-trees gracefully &s;kirt the path. The
rapid de&s;cent to the ba&s;e of the mountain is
highly picture&s;que, the verdant valley be|neath,
in which Airolo is placed, &s;uddenly
opened to us &s;trewn with villages, and,
when compared with the &s;olitudes we had
left, pre&s;ented a large and beautiful pro&s;|pect
of human exi&s;tence; while the gloomy
grandeur of the fore&s;ts of dark pines on
one &s;ide, and the view acro&s;s the valley of
le&s;&s;er mountains, who&s;e la&s;t &s;nows were di&s;|&s;olving
in the &s;ummer ray on the other,
form altogether a &s;cene where &s;ublimity and
grace blend in &s;olemn harmony.</P>
<P>We entered into the Levantine valley at
<PB N="187" REF="206">
Airolo, which is a con&s;iderable village, or
rather a &s;mall town at the foot of St. Go|thard,
hand&s;omely built of &s;tone, and the
chief entrepot or warehou&s;e for all goods
that pa&s;s between this part of Switzerland
and Italy.</P>
<P>The adventurous &s;pirit of commerce,
fearle&s;s of the hanging precipice, the fall|ing
avalanche, and the yawning gulph, fir&s;t
traced the daring path acro&s;s this mountain,
the highe&s;t, after Mont Blanc, in Europe,
and has thus connected, by the &s;oft ties of
civilization, two countries, between which
nature &s;eemed to have placed an in&s;ur|mountable
barrier. A &s;mart girl, the
daughter of the innkeeper at Airolo, &s;poke
of her&s;elf as one of the mountain &s;avages,
with an air &s;o gracefully coquetti&s;h, and in
&s;uch pure Italian, as convinced us that &s;he
would have been much mortified had we
affected to credit her a&s;&s;ertion. She re|minded
<PB N="188" REF="207">
me of an expre&s;&s;ion I had read in
one of Rou&s;&s;eau's unpubli&s;hed letters to the

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Valley of Levantine.&mdash;Torrents of the Te&s;&s;ino.&mdash;Har|ve&s;t-home.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER leaving Airolo, we journeyed
for &s;ome hours on a fine level road, which,
from our late perpendicular travelling, we
found a very agreeable relief. The Te&s;&s;ino
partakes al&s;o of the gentlene&s;s of the plain,
and being joined on its entrance into the
valley by the torrents that flow from the
Glaciers on the ea&s;tern &s;ide, which &s;eparate
this country from the Haut Vallais, rolls
along an ample river, and is &s;till fed in its
progre&s;s by tributary &s;treams from the lofty
mountains that divide the Levantine from
the Gri&s;ons on one &s;ide, and the valleys of
Locarno and Maggia on the other. The
ru&s;hing of waters on our right as we pa&s;&s;ed
<PB N="190" REF="209">
along, led us to penetrate through a little
grove of alder-trees to the river, where we
beheld one of the&s;e torrents paying its ho|mage
to the Te&s;&s;ino in a manner &s;ingularly
graceful. Swelled by the heat on the upper
mountains beyond its u&s;ual volume, it rol|led
impetuou&s;ly down its narrow channel,
and di&s;daining its accu&s;tomed barrier of a
rock, by which divided into two &s;treams
it flowed on each &s;ide into the river; now
ru&s;hing with a fuller tide of waters, it
bounded over the ob&s;tacle which it could
not di&s;place, and mingled it&s;elf with the
Te&s;&s;ino at an ample di&s;tance, after de&s;crib|ing
a lofty and beautifully feathered arch.
The upper part of this valley is chiefly de|voted
to pa&s;turage, but we found the pea|&s;ants
in &s;ome places drying their corn,
which operation is performed by &s;u&s;pend|ing
the &s;heafs on long poles arranged hori|zontally
above each other, and tyed to
others that are &s;tuck in the ground. There
<PB N="191" REF="210">
was a lightne&s;s and grace in the ru&s;tic move|ments
of the&s;e &s;ubject Italians, which their
ma&s;ters on the other &s;ide of St. Gothard
had not yet acquired. At the di&s;tance of
every quarter of a mile in the nooks of
mountains, and on the edge of precipices,
the white &s;pire lifts its &s;tately head, and
gives you, amid&s;t &s;cenes of &s;avage wildne&s;s,
a glimp&s;e of civilization. Secluded amid&s;t
tho&s;e alpine heights from the re&s;t of man|kind,
religion &s;eems to be the &s;ole intellec|tual
plea&s;ure of the inhabitants of the&s;e de|&s;arts,
and the &s;low &s;ounds of the frequent
bell that, amid&s;t the clefts of the rocks,
knolls to church, is heard with a &s;oothing
&s;en&s;ation by the mu&s;ing traveller, flinging
its &s;oft vibrations on the mountain echoes.</P>
<P>The clo&s;ing evening brought us to the
hou&s;e where a toll is received for pa&s;&s;age,
and which we found al&s;o a very plea&s;ant
and comfortable inn.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="211">
Having accompanied the Te&s;&s;ino &s;ince
our departure from Airolo, flowing &s;ome|times
on our right, and &s;ometimes on our
left, with a gentle and &s;teady cour&s;e; we
&s;uppo&s;ed that the youthful &s;pirit with which
it had bounded over its native regions being
now &s;obered, it would continue to pur&s;ue,
with an even current, &startq;the noi&s;ele&s;s tenor
of its way.&endq; The loud roar of many wa|ters,
as we alighted from our hor&s;es at Da|zio,
led us to catch the la&s;t lingering &s;hades
of twilight, and follow tho&s;e powerful
founds. Having advanced a few paces, we
perceived that the &s;pacious valley through
which we had travelled, was abruptly clo&s;ed
by &s;tupendous perpendicular rocks, that left
no other opening than a narrow channel
with a &s;pace gained from it by human in|du&s;try
to form a road between its ma&s;&s;y
walls and the torrent. The waters which
had begun to &s;truggle for pa&s;&s;age above a
bridge which is thrown acro&s;s the &s;tream,
<PB N="193" REF="212">
were now tortured into a thou&s;and forms.
Here a ma&s;s of rock of enormous &s;ize in
the mid&s;t of the channel rai&s;ed the river at
once from its bed, pouring it impetuou&s;ly
into a deep ba&s;on with tremendous roar;
there a rifted cleft, the only outlet to the
waters, increa&s;ed their fury, and da&s;hing
again&s;t the rocks with redoubled force, broke
the torrent into different currents, and filled
the atmo&s;phere with particles of its foam.
The enormous ma&s;&s;es of rock &s;ometimes
lifted erect their bold and &s;avage &s;hapes, and
&s;ometimes, where they had been hollowed
out to form the road, towered at an immen&s;e
height over the path and the torrent with
&s;uch threatening a&s;pect, that I could not
pa&s;s beneath without feeling an involuntary
&s;hudder, which was heightened by the ap|proaching
darkne&s;s. Below the frowning
brow of the rocks, hanging groves of pine
and fir bend maje&s;tically from the cliffs,
while the graceful larch-tree decorates the
<PB N="194" REF="213">
banks, and the weeping birch bends far
over the &s;tream and mingles its long
branches with the agitated waters. The
rapidity of the de&s;cent is communicated to
the river, and a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;weeping ca&s;|cades,
that ru&s;h in every imaginary form
down a channel, worn at a fearful depth
below the level of the road, leads to a
bridge which &s;eemed hung in air over the
gulph, but of which we could only catch
an imperfect glimp&s;e, &s;ince the la&s;t &s;hades
of evening had now fallen on the &s;cene, and
we trod back our &s;teps up the winding
brink of the torrent, not without the deepe&s;t
impre&s;&s;ions of awe &s;oftened by admiration.</P>
<P>On our return we found Dazio the re&s;i|dence
of mirth and gaiety. It was the
harve&s;t-home of the ma&s;ter of the inn, and,
as we pa&s;&s;ed to our apartments, a chorus
met our ear that &s;eemed to bur&s;t from &s;ome
throats more tuneful than tho&s;e of pea&s;ants.
<PB N="195" REF="214">
With the licence allowed to travellers, we
joined the fe&s;tive throng, and were not a
little amu&s;ed with the manner in which this
harmonious circle was compo&s;ed. The
chief of the band, and mo&s;t illu&s;trious of
the gue&s;ts, were half a dozen merry Italian
prie&s;ts, who, it was evident, from their
rubicund faces and &s;parkling looks, had
been con&s;ulting other poets than tho&s;e who&s;e
hymns were to be found in their breviaries
or ma&s;s-books. Great allowances mu&s;t be
made for national cu&s;toms, but the appear|ance
of &s;o many holy men thrilling out
amorous love-&s;ongs, and chanting baccha|nalian
glees, although with voices harmo|niou&s;ly
tuned, and con&s;iderable force of
execution, did not a little &s;urpri&s;e us, who
were accu&s;tomed to the gravity and re&s;erve
of the clerical character in other countries.
We were, however, led to &s;uppo&s;e that
the&s;e prie&s;ts had not over&s;tepped the bounds
here allowed to their profe&s;&s;ion, from the
<PB N="196" REF="215">
delighted and re&s;pectful attention with
which the ru&s;tics around li&s;tened to their
melody; nor is it probable they would
have indulged them&s;elves in this gay de|meanor,
at the ri&s;k of exciting a &s;entiment
of irreverence towards their per&s;ons.</P>
<P>In the morning we went to take another
view of this region of nature's marvels;
day-light had dimini&s;hed &s;omething of its
terror, and we &s;urveyed its &s;avage graces
with renewed a&s;toni&s;hment and rapture;
the rocky fragments now glittered in the
&s;un, and the deep blue Italian &s;ky &s;pread its
lovely canopy over this &s;cene of lavi&s;h
beauty. After pa&s;&s;ing the a&euml;rial bridge, of
which we had caught a di&s;tant glimp&s;e
the preceding evening, we journeyed down
a &s;teep but well-con&s;tructed road on the
edge of the Te&s;&s;ino, which rolled along its
narrow bed, if not with all the daring bold|ne&s;s
of its mountain cour&s;e, at lea&s;t with
<PB N="197" REF="216">
&s;ufficient turbulence to &s;eize the delighted
attention, while the unwearied eye alternate|ly
wandered from the rapid waters to the
picture&s;que drapery of their banks.</P>
<P>As we proceeded, the valley extended
it&s;elf in breadth, and admitted of various
kinds of cultivation, among&s;t which we
remarked that of the purple vines, beneath
who&s;e broad leaves and pendant clu&s;ters,
dropping from fe&s;toons arched over our
heads as we pa&s;&s;ed along the road, we found
relief from the parching heat of the mid|day
&s;un, while we looked up to the &s;nowy
mountains which bounded this &s;cene of
&s;ummer, with a feeling of &s;omething like
regret that we were out of the reach of
their frigid influence.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Government of the Levantine Valley.</HEAD>
<P>THE Levantine Valley contains &s;everal
well-built villages, and the number of inha|bitants,
who are all Italians, is computed at
about twelve thou&s;and. They have in ge|neral
a look of intelligence, and &s;omething
of mountain-independence in their manner;
but are under complete &s;ubjection to the
democracy of the Canton of Uri. The
valley is divided into eight vicinanze or di&s;|tricts,
about a league each in extent. The
village of Faido, which is &s;ituated in the
mid&s;t of the Valley, is the re&s;idence of the
bailiff or governor, who is elected to this
office by the Canton of Uri, or who, rather
agreeably to the e&s;tabli&s;hed mode of election
in the&s;e democracies, purcha&s;es the place of
his fellow citizens, who know too well the
<PB N="199" REF="218">
value of money not to make a good bargain
of their rights. Once in four years the in|habitants
of this Valley behold the cortege
of their new &s;overeign de&s;cending from St.
Gothard, perhaps with &s;omewhat of the
&s;ame &s;en&s;ations as the defencele&s;s timid bird
views the downward flight of the pouncing
hawk, darting on his prey.</P>
<P>The&s;e ru&s;tic monarchs of Uri, in coming
to govern a people, of who&s;e language,
manners and cu&s;toms they are ignorant, do
not appear to be animated by the ambition,
which led Cae&s;ar to wi&s;h rather to be the
fir&s;t man in a village than the &s;econd at
Rome. They have more &s;olid views than
tho&s;e of power; that of repleni&s;hing their
trea&s;ury, exhau&s;ted in rewards to their bro|ther
&s;overeigns for their free &s;uffrages; and
no &s;ooner are they in&s;talled at <HI>Barataria,</HI>
than fines, exactions, and rapacities of every
kind follow in their train, and every re&s;i&s;t|ance
<PB N="200" REF="219">
to lawful authority meets with condign
puni&s;hment: as the hi&s;tory of each of the&s;e
&s;ubject vallies can tell, the hearts of who&s;e
inhabitants have &s;ometimes &s;welled beyond
endurance at the extortion of their harpy
governors.</P>
<P>The people of the Valley revolted again&s;t
their &s;overeign of Uri in the beginning of
this century, and obtained certain privileges,
which their de&s;cendants, by another revolt,
thirty or forty years &s;ince, have imprudently
forfeited. Stung into di&s;obedience by &s;ome
act of procon&s;ular tyranny, they took up
arms again&s;t their &s;overeign, and put them|&s;elves
into a mo&s;t open and daring in&s;urrec|tion.
The Canton of Schweitz had, on a
former occa&s;ion, undertaken to reduce the
in&s;urgents, and had &s;ucceeded; but the pre|&s;ent
rebellion bore &s;ymptoms &s;o alarming,
that the whole of the Cantons armed to
bring the Valley to obedience. Agreeably
<PB N="201" REF="220">
to the maxims of mo&s;t governments, that
the governors are always in the right, and
the governed in the wrong, no Canton can
interfere in any di&s;putes between the &s;ove|reign
and the &s;ubjects, unle&s;s to puni&s;h the
pre&s;umption of the latter.</P>
<P>The whole Helvetic body felt the cau&s;e of
the &s;overeign of Uri to be their own, and
with heart and hand, with an alacrity
worthy of the cau&s;e, coale&s;ced together to put
a deci&s;ive &s;top to &s;uch heretical and daner|ous
preten&s;ions. Had the rebels only had
to contend with their ma&s;ters of Uri, it is
po&s;&s;ible they might have &s;haken their au|thority;
but when the in&s;urgents beheld
the cohorts of every regular government in
Switzerland pouring down from the moun|tains
in warlike array; heard the loud bla&s;t
of their trumpets, repeated by a thou&s;and
echoes amid&s;t their cliffs and rocks; &s;aw
terror in the van, and annihilation in the rear;
<PB N="202" REF="221">
they very prudently gave up a conte&s;t, which
mu&s;t have ended in their utter de&s;truc|tion.</P>
<P>The grievances of the in&s;urgents were re|dre&s;&s;ed
in the mode that might rationally be
expected: their form of government, and
all their laws were aboli&s;hed, and they were
deprived of every privilege, municipal,
civil, and judicial: the u&s;e of arms, to
which every Swi&s;s is accu&s;tomed, however
low his rank in the &s;cale of &s;ociety, was
&s;trictly forbidden, and this &s;age precaution
has perpetuated their dominion, by de&s;troy|ing,
not only the means, but the knowledge
of re&s;i&s;tance, &s;ince he who never handles
arms mu&s;t remain ignorant of the exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus the former &s;ubjects of the Levan|tine
Valley became the unre&s;i&s;ting &s;laves of
their citizen-&s;overeigns, and the bailiff of
Uri is now their &s;ole admini&s;trator, law|giver,
<PB N="203" REF="222">
and judge. No one indeed can di&s;|pute
the right of this Canton, and its allies,
to reduce the&s;e rebels to obedience, &s;ince the
charten of their &s;ervitude is clearly e&s;tabli&s;h|ed
by every document of hi&s;tory. In an|cient
times they were probably, like other
mountaineers, wild, and free: but in the
twelfth century the country belonged to
bi&s;hops, then to the chapter of Milan; and
in the fourteenth century Charles the Fourth
mortgaged his imperial prefecture for a
trfling &s;um to Conrad or John Moos; the
&s;ame per&s;onage, who had before monopo|lized
the prefecture of Ur&s;eren. The can|ons
of Milan, to rid them&s;elves of the fa|tigues
of government, gave up their eccle|&s;ia&s;tical
titles to their duke; by whom they
were tran&s;mitted in the middle of the
fifteenth century, on what conditions we
know not, to the Canton of Uri, who have
ever &s;ince prudently kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. It
therefore clearly appears, that whether go|verned
<PB N="204" REF="223">
by bi&s;hops, emperors, chapters,
canons, John Moos, dukes or democrats,
the inhabitants of the Levantine have al|ways,
&s;ince the twelfth century, been either
&s;ubjects or &s;erfs.</P>
<P>While the Canton of Uri takes care of
the civil concerns of the inhabitants of this
Valley, the archbi&s;hop of Milan admini&s;ters
to their &s;piritual nece&s;&s;ities: being judge in
all eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;putes, with the privilege
of placing his vicar general as rector in the
&s;eminary at Faido. Now, as the Archbi&s;hop
of Milan, under every political change, pre|&s;erves
the &s;anctity of his character, he mu&s;t
no doubt continue archbi&s;hop, whether it be
as Pontiff under the Emperor of Ger|many,
or as &s;imple citizen of the Ci&s;alpine
Republic. Whatever degree of fraternity,
therefore, may in future exi&s;t between this
Republic, and that of Uri, it is to be pre|&s;umed,
that no flight care will be taken by
<PB N="205" REF="224">
the latter to prevent the admi&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e
principles, which have found their way into
Lombardy, &s;ince if ever the&s;e principles
&s;hould overleap their pre&s;ent geographical
boundary, and become points of con&s;cience
with the &s;ubjects of the Valley, the Canton
of Uri will perhaps in vain apply to this re|publican

di&s;obedience.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Government of the Canton of Uri.&mdash;Origin of Swift
Freedom.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING traced this &s;hort &s;ketch of the
manner in which the democratic Cantons
of Switzerland govern their &s;ubjects, it will
perhaps be proper to relate, in a few words,
the manner in which they govern them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>The government of the Cantons of Uri,
Schweitz, and Underwalden, is &s;aid to be
democratic. The&s;e &s;tates were once, like
other parts of Switzerland, dependent on
the empire, and whether they were deemed
from their &s;ituation not worth the labour of
conque&s;t, or were comprehended in that
policy which engaged the princes of the
<PB N="207" REF="226">
empire to grant &s;pecial immunities to vari|ous
cities and di&s;tricts, the inhabitants of
the&s;e wild countries enjoyed the privilege
of chu&s;ing their own magi&s;trates, and be|ing
governed by their own laws. This li|berty,
however, was &s;ometimes re&s;trained
by the pre&s;ence of an emperor's bailiff, who
re&s;ided among&s;t them as &s;upreme judge in
criminal ca&s;es, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed other imperial
prerogatives. From &s;ome neglect of tho&s;e
governors, it happened that the Cantons
were often left to their own admini&s;tration,
and in one of the&s;e intervals we find, from
hi&s;tory, they united together in the begin|ning
of the twelfth century, in defence of
their rights, agian&s;t the unju&s;t attacks of
the monks of the famous Abbey of Ein&s;id|len.
In vain did civil power come in aid
of eccle&s;ia&s;tical thunders. Neither the ban
of the empire, nor the excommunication of
the church, could &s;hake, even in tho&s;e ages
of darkne&s;s and &s;ervitude, the intrepid minds
<PB N="208" REF="227">
of the&s;e mountaineers; and their re&s;i&s;tance
to the monks, the emperor, and the church,
was, after a &s;truggle of thirty or forty
years, crowned with &s;ucce&s;s. Their leagues,
offen&s;ive or defen&s;ive, with each other, could
not, however, pre&s;erve their independence.
In &s;pite of their petitions and remon&s;trances,
Rodolphe, Count of Hap&s;bourg, was &s;ent
in the beginning of the thirteenth century,
by the Emperor, Otho the Fourth, as im|perial
prefect; and it appears, from the
good under&s;tanding between the&s;e Cantons,
and the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of the Emperor, Frederick
the Second, that their chains were not worn
with an ill grace, nor was their a&s;&s;i&s;tance
to him in his Italian wars le&s;s chearfully
given from his being then under the &s;en|tence
of papal excommunication.</P>
<P>The death of this emperor, in the middle
of the thirteenth century, having thrown
the empire into long confu&s;ion, the inhabi|tants
<PB N="209" REF="228">
of the&s;e Cantons, in&s;tead of taking
advantage of the troubles, and regaining
their late &s;hort-lived independence, cho&s;e
for their captain-general, defender, or go|vernor,
another Rodolphe, Count of Hap&s;|bourg.
It appears, however, that the Count
performed e&s;&s;ential &s;ervices to the&s;e Can|tons,
and when he was named to the pur|ple,
confirmed or be&s;towed on them various
privileges; but during the reign of his
ambitious &s;on they obtained their indepen|dence.
Albert had &s;ucceeded in bringing
&s;everal adjoining Cantons under his domi|nion;
the town of Zurich alone re&s;i&s;ted his
&s;olicitations and menaces, and was defended,
in 1299, with valour and effect by the
Abbe&s;s, who was governe&s;s of the town,
and who di&s;dained to &s;ubmit to the Hou&s;e
of Au&s;tria. Various were the expedients
made u&s;e of by the new Emperor to engage
the inhabitants of the three Cantons to &s;ur|render
their privileges, and prucha&s;e their tran|quillity
<PB N="210" REF="229">
by obedience; and many were the
outrages to which they had &s;ubmitted from
procon&s;ular tyrants under the name of bai|liffs,
who were &s;ent among&s;t them with as
little ceremony, and with equal right, as
their own officers of the &s;ame de&s;cription
are now deputed to regulate the concerns of
their Levantine &s;ubjects. At length the
three heroes, Slauffach, Fur&s;t, and Arnold,
formed their renowned con&s;piracy again&s;t
the tyrant, and on the fir&s;t day of the year
1307, liberated their country, by &s;eizing
and &s;ending out of their territory all their
imperial governors. Their liberty was not
obtained without a &s;truggle; the battle of
Morgarten, in which the Au&s;trians were
routed by an incon&s;iderable number of
Swi&s;s, brought on the confederation at
Brunnen, and laid the foundation for the
adhe&s;ion of the other Cantons, which &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively
joined the alliance, and the &s;pirit
of freedom proved a more powerful barrier
<PB N="211" REF="230">
again&s;t the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, than even
their rocks or their mountains.</P>
<P>Each Canton, on the acqui&s;ition of its in|dependence,
cho&s;e its own form of govern|ment,
and the three Cantons who fir&s;t freed
them&s;elves from the yoke, made choice of
that in which the &s;upreme power re&s;ides
e&s;&s;entially in the people. Each individual
who has attained the age of fourteen years,
forms a member of the &s;overeignty, who meet
every year on the fir&s;t of May in a general
council of the nation, in order to form laws
and elect magi&s;trates. The executive power
is entru&s;ted to a regency, who, under this an|nual
&s;alutary in&s;pection, are no doubt careful
to admini&s;ter their government in &s;uch a
manner, as to meet their repre&s;entatives the
en&s;uing year without the dread of cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this Canton are
e&s;teemed, by early hi&s;torians, for the po|litene&s;s
<PB N="212" REF="231">
and &s;incerity of their manners to|wards
&s;trangers; but the accounts given by
later writers are very contradictory to this
ob&s;ervation. Madame de Sillery, who, af|ter
her bani&s;hment from France, re&s;ided
&s;ome months in one of the&s;e democratic
Cantons, a&s;&s;erts, that there is no other
country in the world where &s;trangers are &s;o
ill-treated. It is probable, however, that
travellers in general would meet with more
kindne&s;s than fell to the lot of Madame Sil|lery,
who had acted too di&s;tingui&s;hed a part
in the French Revolution to have any claims
to a cordial reception in the&s;e Cantons.
We were our&s;elves warned to conceal care|fully
on our journey that we had any rela|tion
with France.</P>
<P>The truth is, that the inhabitants of the
democratic Cantons of Switzerland are un|der
the dominion of a power far more ab|&s;olute
than that exerci&s;ed by the privileged
<PB N="213" REF="232">
cla&s;&s;es of the great Cantons. This power
is &s;uper&s;tition, and with the aid of this
mighty engine, which molds the pa&s;&s;ions at
will, the prie&s;ts have atchieved &s;till more
than the ari&s;tocracy, and have repre&s;ented
the French as apo&s;tates, that war not merely
with earth, but with heaven. No other part
of Switzerland is &s;o unenlightened, and
con&s;equently &s;o ho&s;tile to the &s;pirit of true
liberty, as the&s;e little Cantons, where de|mocracy
and de&s;poti&s;m march under the
&s;ame banners; for although the government
is democratic, the number of tho&s;e who have
a right to a &s;eat in the general a&s;&s;embly is
incon&s;iderable, compared with the numbers
that are excluded.</P>
<P>It is computed by a late writer, that the
population of the three Cantons of Uri,
Schweitz, and Underwalden, with the de|mocracies
of Zug and Glaris, amount to no
more than eighty-three thou&s;and &s;ouls, and
<PB N="214" REF="233">
furni&s;h only twenty thou&s;and active citi|zens;
while the countries over which they
hold &s;ole or divided authority, contain a
population of three hundred and thirty-&s;even
thou&s;and. The government, there|fore,
though democratic with re&s;pect to
tho&s;e individuals who make a part of the
&s;overeignty, is to the unprivileged inhabitants
of the Cantons, and to its &s;ubjects in the
bailiwicks, a confirmed hereditary ari&s;to|cracy;
and while in other countries the dif|ferent
cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety are &s;eparated from
each other by different habitudes, which
makes the evil of &s;ubordination le&s;s felt
here, where the reigning and the &s;ubject
cla&s;s are the equal companions of each others
childhood, the latter mu&s;t perceive with
peculiar bitterne&s;s, as they approach to
manhood, that they are de&s;tined to no &s;hare
of the boa&s;ted liberty of their country; but
that if born on the northern &s;ide of the
mountain of St. Gothard, they are &s;ub|jects,
<PB N="215" REF="234">
and if on the &s;outhern they are
&s;laves.</P>
<P>Avarice, as well as &s;uper&s;tition, has
contributed to render the people of the little
Cantons ho&s;tile to the French Revolution,
and event which has interrupted the inter|change
of tho&s;e friendly courte&s;ies which,
before that period, pa&s;&s;ed between France
and tho&s;e Cantons. We cannot be much
&s;urpri&s;ed that the ari&s;tocratical Cantons of
Switzerland felt little &s;ympathy in the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment
of French equality; but we might
perhaps have expected more congenial &s;en|timents
in governments, the exi&s;tence of
which conveys a tacit approbation at lea&s;t of
the &s;overeignty of the people, till we are
informed that France, while a monarchy,
paid a tribute to the&s;e &s;overeigns, which
the great Cantons had indignantly rejected.
Each male child of the three democratic
Cantons received from the day of its birth
<PB N="216" REF="235">
&s;ix livres annually, and the magi&s;trates were
paid in proportion. The exchange was
fair, money for friend&s;hip. The French
republicans have broken the treaty, no
more money is paid, and no more friend&s;hip
is returned; and the&s;e democrats are as
much incen&s;ed at this violation of the com|pact,
as if their own &s;ubjects had broken
their allegiance.</P>
<P>It requires no great penetration to di&s;|cover
that the abu&s;es which exi&s;t in the&s;e
Swi&s;s governments will be corrected, not
&s;o much perhaps from the &s;truggles of the
oppre&s;&s;ed, as from the conviction in tho&s;e
who govern, how much it behoves their in|tere&s;t
to loo&s;en the reins of arbitrary power.
The hi&s;tory of every country is full of ex|amples
how fatal to tyranny is the bur&s;t of
the heart that &s;wells again&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion. But
without recurring to cla&s;&s;ic &s;tory, the Swi&s;s
have only to con&s;ult their own annals, when

and they will probably reflect that the age
of heroi&s;m is not pa&s;t with that of chivalry;
but that tho&s;e who march in the &s;teps of an

Stauffaken, or a William Tell.</P>

<P>AFTER leaving the town of Faido, we
continued our route along the valley, ever
pre&s;enting &s;ome &s;cene of wild, &s;olemn, ma|je&s;tic
beauty, over which the eye wandered
with unwearied delight; of which the pic|ture
is indelibly graven on the imagination,
and which memory recals with &s;oothing
rapture; but when the pen would trace
tho&s;e images which glow upon the heart, it
is found unfaithful to the purpo&s;e! How
impo&s;&s;ible to convey an adequate idea of
tho&s;e varied, tho&s;e colo&s;&s;al regions, compar|ed
to which all other &s;cenery is tame and

and unprofitable.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="238">
The beautiful little town of Giornico,
which we pa&s;&s;ed, is famous for a victory
gained by the Swi&s;s, the latter end of the
fifteenth century, over one of the Sforzas,
duke of Milan, who, di&s;contented with the
ce&s;&s;ion made of this valley by his ance&s;tors,
came to reconquer the territory. Some of
the artillery taken in this engagement are
here pre&s;erved as trophies. When we came
to Pollezio, we were once more on even
ground. This is the la&s;t di&s;trict of the val|ley,
and compared with the upper part, is
of con&s;ider|able
breadth, bearing all the pro|ductions
of flat countries. The Te&s;&s;ino
increa&s;ed by numerous &s;treams, &s;welled by
the torrent flowing from Monte Ucello, and
no longer confined between beds of rocks
that re&s;i&s;t its impetuo&s;ity, frequently inun|dates
the lower part of this valley, called
Riviera, the Valley of the River, and which
is mar&s;hy, and unwhole&s;ome.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="239">
Further on, the waters of the Moe&s;a,
ru&s;hing in a cataract from the mountains of
the Gri&s;ons, pour them&s;elves into the Te&s;|&s;ino,
which now rolls on with gentle cour&s;e,
a broad and ample river, till it forms the
Lago Magiore. We cro&s;&s;ed the river of the
Gri&s;ons, and entered on the territory of
Bellinzone, and after pa&s;&s;ing through two
or three plea&s;ant villages, hid amid&s;t the
purple fe&s;toons, hanging from the trees ripe
for the vintage, and which had a more
picture&s;que appearance than the huge &s;tatues
of St. Chri&s;topher, with which they were
decorated by the piety of the inhabitants, we
came within &s;ight of the town.</P>
<P>Bellinzone is &s;ituated near the foot of
Mount Cenere, and is al&s;o bounded by that
chain of &s;oftened hills, which ranged in wild
di&s;order, &s;eparate the lower valley of the
Levantine from the Swi&s;s bailiwicks of
Maggia and Locarno. Three ca&s;tles, erect|ed
<PB N="221" REF="240">
on lofty heights, frown over the walls
of the city, and are &s;ucce&s;&s;ively the re&s;i|dence
of the bailiffs of the three democra|tic
Cantons of Uri, Schweitz, and Under|walden,
to which Bellinzone and its de|pendencies
are &s;ubject. We had now en|tirely
quitted every thing that was Swi&s;s,
except their dominion, and found a con&s;ide|rable
change, not only in the manners, but
in the phy&s;iognomy of the people. The
women have here the fine expre&s;&s;ion of the
Madona countenance; &s;omething of which
had fir&s;t &s;truck us at Lucerne; and in the
men, we ob&s;erved the robu&s;t form of the
mountaineer &s;oftened by a look of Italian
civilization. We were al&s;o reminded of
our approach to Italy, by a coar&s;e imitation
of its ta&s;te in the plai&s;tered piazza, the gilt
balcony, and the painted Corinthian pillars,
with which the hou&s;es were decorated. The
principal church, a building of fine con|&s;truction,
rich in ornaments, and a con&s;iderable
<PB N="222" REF="241">
number of religious edifices, give an
air of dignity to the place. After repo&s;ing
our&s;elves a &s;hort time at Bellinzone, we
ha&s;tened to Lugano, being de&s;irous to &s;ee
the ceremony of the in&s;tallation of the go|vernor,
which was to take place within a
few days.</P>
<P>Our road to this town lay acro&s;s Mount
Cenere, the la&s;t of that chain of mountains,
formerly called the Rhetian Alps, which
divide the Gri&s;ons from the Valtaline, and
other parts of Italy. Having travelled about
a league along the valley on the &s;outh of
Bellinzone, we began to climb the &s;teep
a&s;cent of Mount Cenere; and as we jour|neyed
in the mid-day &s;un, &s;hould have been
much incommoded by the heat, had not the
luxuriant branches of the che&s;nut, which
grows to a prodigious &s;ize, and in the mo&s;t
lavi&s;h profu&s;ion on this mountain, &s;pread a
friendly &s;helter over our path.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="242">
The woods of Mount Cenere, we were
told, were the haunts of robbers, who find
a refuge from ju&s;tice in their wild rece&s;&s;es,
and al&s;o from this mountain being a fron|tier,
of which the legal juri&s;diction is un|certain.
Its &s;outhern promontory &s;tretch|ing
to the river, which joins the lakes of
Lugano and Locarno, is &s;o infe&s;ted by &s;er|pents,
that at this &s;ea&s;on of the year, nei|ther
men or cattle could approach it with|out
danger. Half way up this mountain
fore&s;t, we were pre&s;ented with a noble view
over the Lago Maggiore, the great lake, to
Locarno, and &s;aw in the back-ground the
lofty mountains ri&s;ing to Glaciers, which
&s;eparate the Vallais from Italy. After a ride
of three hours, having gained the &s;ummit,
we began to de&s;cend into a lovely pa&s;toral
country, which opened to our view on the
oppo&s;ite &s;ide. The Alps were here &s;oft|ened
into hills, which, when not covered
with hanging woods, wore the appearance
<PB N="224" REF="243">
of the mo&s;t &s;miling cultivation, and di&s;|played
in beautiful &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, tho&s;e vary|ing
groupes of picture&s;que objects with
which the land&s;cape painter delights to de|corate
his &s;cene. Along this valley, called
the Valley of Agano, runs a &s;mall rivulet,
bearing away the la&s;t &s;nows from the Ga|moghera,
which lifts high in the di&s;tance
its pyramidal head, and is the central point
of the frontier mountains, &s;tretching in va|rious
directions from the Valteline, the Gri|&s;ons,
and the Italian bailiwicks: its &s;um|mit,
we were told, commands a magni|ficent
view, not only over tho&s;e moun|tainous
regions, but which, piercing beyond
them, extends as far as the city of Milan,
the cathedral of which may be &s;een from
that elevated point.</P>
<P>After a delicious ride through this roman|tic
and peopled valley, we came in view of
the lake and town of Lugano, where we
<PB N="225" REF="244">
&s;oon arrived, and were informed, that the
augu&s;t ceremony of the in&s;tallation of the
governor was to take place on the follow|ing
day. In the mean time we found, that
the magnificent and &s;overeign lords of the
the Cantons, who vi&s;it on the&s;e occa&s;ions the
chief &s;eat of ultra-montaine juri&s;diction,
had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the great apart|ments
of the principal inn, where we had
alighted, and where they were deliberating
in full a&s;&s;embly on various weighty matters
of government, and unravelling knotty
points of civil and contentions concern, to
the determination of which the ordinary
knowledge of the municipal authorities of
their jurisdiction was con&s;idered as incom|petent
or un&s;atisfactory. As this was not a
part of the ceremony which appeared the
mo&s;t intere&s;ting, we hired a felucca in or|der
to pa&s;s the remainder of the afternoon
on the lake, and view its enchanting &s;cene|ry.
The lake, which is extremely irregular,

<P>THE following day was u&s;hered in by a
concert of bells from every &s;teeple in the
town and neighbourhood. The &s;treets
were crouded with well-dre&s;&s;ed people of
both &s;exes, who had come from various
parts of the country, and beyond the lake,
to celebrate the gay fe&s;tival. After break|fa&s;t
the magnificent deputies of the laudable
Helvetic Body mar&s;halled them&s;elves in or|der,
and preceded by their heralds, &s;tand|ard-bearers,
trumpeters, and other attend|ants,
marched in proce&s;&s;ion up the hill to
the great church of St. Lugano, where
this &s;olemn ceremony was to take place.
There we found a numerous a&s;&s;emblage of
<PB N="232" REF="251">
ladies and gentlemen dre&s;&s;ed with elegance,
&s;ome of whom had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
pulpit, reading-de&s;k, and altar, and were
li&s;tening with polite attention to the un|couth
&s;ounds which i&s;&s;ued from the ai&s;le
below, and which mu&s;t have &s;eemed barbar|ous
di&s;&s;onance to the delicacy of an Italian
car. Tho&s;e inharmonious accents proceeded
from the lips of the Recorder of the baili|wick,
or the clerk of the magnificent de|putation,
who was reading, in the Swi&s;s
language, to the new &s;overeign, the laws,
cu&s;toms, and regulations, by which he was
to govern, during two years, the noble
town and di&s;trict of Lugano. For the be|nefit
of tho&s;e who were to be governed, and
that no po&s;&s;ibility of collu&s;ion might take
place, the &s;ame engagement which the new
governor had taken in German, he took
afterwards in Italian. No &s;ooner had this
double act been properly admini&s;tered, and
the people once more &s;ecure in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
<PB N="233" REF="252">
their governor, than the vaults of the church
re$ounded with the cries of <HI>Viva! Viva!</HI>
long live our gracious bailiff, and the mo&s;t
illu&s;trious deputies of the magnificent Can|tons
of Switzerland; to which affectionate
exclamation, in the &s;ilver &s;ounds of Italian,
German re&s;pon&s;es were poured forth by the
deputation, of long live the noble city and
bailiwick of Lugano!</P>
<P>That the deputation, with cordial &s;ince|rity,
&s;hould pray for long life and health to
the noble town of Lugano, was perfectly
natural; the motives to a reciprocal attach|ment,
on the part of the bailiwick, are
&s;omewhat le&s;s evident.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the &s;ixteenth cen|tury,
Maximilian Sforza, Duke of Milan,
made a donation of the territory of Lugano
to the Swi&s;s, for the aid they gave him in
driving the French out of Italy, and which
<PB N="234" REF="253">
was confirmed three years after by Francis
the Fir&s;t, when he made peace with the
Cantons, whom he had defeated at the fa|mous
battle of Marignan. As the Swi&s;s
received the gift unincumbered with any
conditions, &s;uch as privileges, rights, or
immunities, in favour of the people, &s;o they
have religiou&s;ly handed it down unchanged
to their po&s;terity. The power of the bailiff
is almo&s;t unlimited. He is the repre&s;enta|tive
and co-&s;overeign with the Cantons, the
fountain of all honor, power, and glory,
&s;ole judge in all civil and criminal matters,
but a&s;&s;i&s;ted in his important functions by a
&s;yndical, a &s;ecretarial, a lieutenant bailiff,
and other officers, &s;o that no complaint
&s;hould exi&s;t among the people of a &s;carcity
of per&s;ons to govern them.</P>
<P>The municipal regulations, however, of
the towns and villages in the bailiwicks,
are entru&s;ted to per&s;ons cho&s;en by the inha|bitants,
<PB N="235" REF="254">
but no laws are enacted that are not
in perfect accord with the will of the &s;ove|reign,
and &s;ubmitted to his &s;anction.</P>
<P>The &s;tated revenue of the&s;e bailiwicks is
unfortunately not very con&s;iderable, and the
emoluments of the bailiffs chiefly ari&s;e
from &s;peculations on the di&s;play of the
wor&s;t pa&s;&s;ions of our nature, &s;uch as fines
in criminal ca&s;es. Much cannot be &s;aid of
the paternal protection given to that &s;tate,
where the governors become rich in propor|tion
as their &s;ubjects become wicked. Such
&s;ort of financial &s;peculations, we were told,
are too frequently to be found in the hi&s;tory
of Swi&s;s procon&s;ular admini&s;tration; the la|titude
of power being almo&s;t unbounded,
and the love of money being proverbially
the &s;in which mo&s;t ea&s;ily be&s;ets tho&s;e &s;ove|reigns,
it is not &s;urprizing that the merit of
di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s &s;hould be uncommon.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="255">
&startq;The avidity of their governors,&endq; we
are informed by one of their apologi&s;ts,
&startq;when it pa&s;&s;es its <HI>ju&s;t</HI> bounds, has been
very often repre&s;&s;ed by the &s;ydictorial de|puties,
who are &s;ent to regulate the ac|counts.&endq;
What are the <HI>ju&s;t</HI> bounds of a
Swi&s;s bailiff's avidity is not preci&s;ely mark|ed,
but there is rea&s;on to believe that it is
not puni&s;hed by the&s;e fraternal deputies
with extreme &s;everity.</P>
<P>The &s;ame author laments that the inhabi|tants
of the&s;e bailiwicks are much addicted
to chicane, and that frequent law-&s;uits di&s;|turb
the peace of families. This ta&s;te for
legal contention is the more &s;ingular, as the
di&s;putants are deprived of one con&s;iderable
plea&s;ure in the controver&s;y, which is, the
knowledge of the language in which they
contend, all civil cau&s;es being tried in Ger|man.
The bailiffs, who in general are
ignorant of the Italian, are always attended
<PB N="237" REF="256">
by interpreters; but who &s;hall tran&s;late, for
the benefit of the Italian client, the wordy
war of German attornies?</P>
<P>Whatever grounds of complaint from
procon&s;ular rapacity might have exi&s;ted in
former times, we were happy to hear,
amid&s;t univer&s;al plaudits, of the return of
the golden age under the admini&s;tration of
the mo&s;t illu&s;trious Signor Don France&s;co
Saverio Zeltner, coun&s;ellor and captain of
artillery of the mo&s;t excellent city and re|public
of Soleure, who now terminates his
mo&s;t upright government of captain regent
of Lugano. The admini&s;tration of this
renewed governor was celebrated in odes,
&s;onnets, and other poetical records, which
were di&s;tributed in the church with great
profu&s;ion at the clo&s;e of the ceremonial.
No Horace or Waller could &s;tring the lyre
with fonder raptures to the glories of Au|gu&s;tus
or Cromwell, than that which bur&s;t
<PB N="238" REF="257">

immortal bailiff. The names of heroes
who lived before Agamemnon have peri&s;h|ed,
we are told, in unknown night, becau&s;e

thrice gallant Capuchin P. C. A. Griconi,
who, while others are tuning the &s;tring to
the prai&s;es of the illu&s;trious Zeltner, is
warbling, with no le&s;s harmony, the peer|le&s;s
accompli&s;hments of the mo&s;t lovely
Signora Donna Or&s;ola Zeltner, his wife:
not forgetting, in the hurry of his pinda|rics,
that the God of War had entru&s;ted to
the hu&s;band

<P>Poor is even prai&s;e like this, when com|pared

What were the di&s;tingui&s;hed acts of this
ex-bailiff, which rai&s;ed him in the &s;ongs of
his enthu&s;ia&s;tic admirers above Alexander,
or what was the triumph he had merited,
&s;uch as Athens or Sparta never witne&s;&s;ed,
we were unable to di&s;cover. Zeltner, we
under&s;tood from &s;ome of his brother depu|ties,
was a re&s;pectable captain of artillery at

<P>Having yet &s;een little more than that
part of the lake which forms the bay, on
which the town is &s;ituated, and invited by
the beautiful pro&s;pect from the terrace of
St. Lawrence, we left the noble company
<PB N="247" REF="266">
at Lugano, in the full glow of mutual
compliment and congratulation, to &s;pend
the remainder of the day in &s;ailing along
the &s;hores. The lake about half way down
divides into two branches, one of which
leads to the village of Porto, and the other
to the village called Capo di Lago, the Head
of the Lake, to which we directed our cour&s;e.
It was the fea&s;t of St. Lawrence, and the
whole country &s;eemed animated on the oc|ca&s;ion.
After vi&s;iting &s;ome of the villages
and churches in the neighbourhood, we re|turned
to Capo di Lago, where a repa&s;t was
prepared for us of fine trout ju&s;t fi&s;hed

by the &s;oft evening breeze. We had &s;ailed
in the morning down the right &s;ide of the
lake, and now returned to Lugano in the
oppo&s;ite direction along banks, where the
dark rock &s;ometimes ro&s;e abrupt, and bare
from the water; but the gay larch that had
&s;truck root in its crev$$es, &s;oftened as it
floated in the air the gloom of its &s;haggy
brow: and &s;ometimes the olive, and the
fig-tree, though not objects of graceful
<PB N="250" REF="269">
form, contra&s;ted agreeably the wildne&s;s of
the &s;cene.</P>
<P>In pa&s;&s;ing before the church of a village,
placed at &s;ome little di&s;tance on the &s;lope
ri&s;ing from the lake, and embo&s;omed among
trees, between two &s;teep mountains, we
were again &s;aluted with &s;acred &s;ong. It was
the Ve&s;peral hymn, proceeding from female
voices, flinging its &s;weet full cadence upon
the breeze, and dying along the waters.</P>
<P>Our boatmen $lackened their oars, and
catching the fond enthu&s;ia&s;m, &s;ung the cho|rus
in tones far from inharmonious, and in
which they were joined by pa&s;&s;engers of
their acquaintance, to whom, with &s;ome
confidence in our good nature, they had
given a place in our boat; while, at inter|vals,
a &s;mall company, who were &s;eated on
the edge of the water to enjoy the even|ing
<PB N="251" REF="270">
fre&s;hne&s;s, caught and prolonged the
notes.</P>
<P>Twilight had &s;pread all its doubtful
&s;hapes and mild gradations over the &s;ha|dowy
&s;cene before we reached Lugano,
where we found a numerous a&s;&s;emblage
&s;eated on the terrace, opening to the waters,
or &s;ipping lemonade in the ca&s;&s;inos: &s;ome
were chanting &s;ongs, not in honor of St.
Lawrence, but of their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, and others
forming mu&s;ical or dancing parties in the
adjoining pavilions; &s;o that the magnificent
high and mighty Lords, the Swi&s;s burge&s;&s;es,
their &s;overeigns on the other &s;ide of the
mountains, could not be more happy, with
all their power and glory, than their Italian
&s;ubjects of the charming regions around
the lake of Lugano.</P>
<P>The town of Lugano is the &s;eat of bu&s;i|ne&s;s
as well as plea&s;ure, being from the na|vigation
<PB N="252" REF="271">
of the lake, the chief entrepot of
the commerce carried on between the nor|thern
part of Italy, and the countries beyond
the Alps. There is al&s;o a printing e&s;ta|bli&s;hment
in this town, where the proprietor
of a Gazette, called The Lugano Journal,
has the boldne&s;s, under the rod of power,
to record the political events of the times
with truth and impartiality.</P>
<P>Having fini&s;hed our excur&s;ions in the en|virons
of this beautiful country, we return|ed
in a more &s;outherly direction over Mount
Cenere, towards the Lago Maggiore. The
view from the &s;ummit of the mountain,
over the exten&s;ive lake, &s;tretching to the
Borromean I&s;lands, and the fertile plains of
Lombardy, is highly magnificent. Tho&s;e
far-famed i&s;lands, we were obliged, from
political con&s;iderations, to leave unvi&s;ited,
not without a &s;igh of regret on my part,
that &s;ince Swi&s;s territory extended &s;o far be|yond
<PB N="253" REF="272">
its natural boundary the Alps, it had
not repelled the limit of the Emperor's do|minions
a little farther. At the village of
Meggedino, lying at the foot of Mount
Cenere, we took a boat, and in two hours
were conveyed acro&s;s the lake to Locarno;
which town is &s;ituated on its ea&s;tern &s;ide,
and forms a picture&s;que object beneath &s;teep
mountains.</P>
<P>This bailiwick, about fifteen miles in
length and breadth, abounding in pa&s;turage,
wines, and fruits, was given like Lugano
to the Swi&s;s Cantons by the Duke of
Milan.</P>
<P>On our landing, finding the &s;treets a de|&s;ert,
we &s;trayed through the town in &s;earch
of its inhabitants, whom we found a&s;&s;em|bled
in and around a church, preparing
them&s;elves for a &s;olemn &s;ervice, which was
to take place the following day. We ram|bled
<PB N="254" REF="273">
through the town; parts of which are
plea&s;ant, but it wears upon the whole a dull
and mona&s;tic appearance. If one may
judge from the number of churches, prie&s;ts,
and convents, compared with the number of
hou&s;es and inhabitants, there is no &s;pot
among the&s;e mountains, where a per&s;on
may e&s;cape &s;o entirely from the bu&s;tle
of this world, and find &s;o many guides
to conduct him to another. The inhabi|tants,
we were told, had lately been
increa&s;ed by a cla&s;s of unfortunate French,
who&s;e pro&s;pects were then falling fa&s;t into
the &s;hade. We &s;aw a number of them
&s;auntering idly along the walks; and as all
evils are relative, it was impo&s;&s;ible to ob|&s;erve,
without &s;ympathy, tho&s;e once gay
and gallant nobles, wearing out life in the
li&s;tle&s;s &s;olitude of Locarno.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Storm on the Lake.&mdash;Return to Bellinzone.&mdash;Vi&s;it to a
Convent.&mdash;In&s;tallation of the Bailiff of Bellinzone.</HEAD>
<P>ONE of the inconveniences of travelling
in mountainous countries, is the extreme
capriciou&s;ne&s;s of the weather. Amid&s;t
tho&s;e regions of &s;torm, the un&s;heltered tra|veller
feels the full bla&s;t as it comes fre&s;h
from the airy cavern; but no where is its
violence &s;o dangerous as on the lakes,
which, enclo&s;ed between lofty mountains,
receive the &s;trong currents of the tempe&s;tu|ous
winds in their &s;truggle through the
narrow &s;paces, and &s;uddenly rai&s;e their
troubled waters into foaming fury. The
extreme heat of the weather had long pre|&s;aged
a thunder &s;torm; but although we
&s;aw clouds at a remote di&s;tance gathering on
<PB N="256" REF="275">
the &s;ummits, we had little apprehen&s;ion on
embarking, that we &s;hould feel their di&s;|charge
before we reached the oppo&s;ite
&s;hore.</P>
<P>Our boatmen, more experienced than
our&s;elves, had warned my companions, as
I was afterwards informed, that the breeze
was on its way, and offered to return the fol|lowing
morning; but among my fellow tra|vellers
were three Engli&s;hmen, and the new&s;|papers
waited for them at Bellinzone. Storms,
when weighed again&s;t new&s;papers, were
found light in the balance, and the ve&s;&s;el
was ordered to be got ready. We had nearly
reached the middle of the lake, before the
tempe&s;t, which we &s;aw gathering thicker
on the hills, began to agitate the waters.
At fir&s;t the lightning fla&s;hing in white
fanta&s;tic &s;treaks, and the lofty thunder echo|ing
along the mountains, were objects of
plea&s;ing, though awful admiration; and we
<PB N="257" REF="276">
were indulging our&s;elves with the hope,
that the &s;torm was pa&s;&s;ing away harmle&s;s,
when a bur&s;t of wind &s;truck on the lake,
and threw the foaming waters into our
bark. It was too late to return, &s;ince the
wind ru&s;hing down the lake, which we
were cro&s;&s;ing, would have rendered retreat
as difficult as going forward.</P>
<P>The &s;torm increa&s;ed every moment, and
the boatmen attempted to make land at any
point, but their efforts were ineffectual.
Our progre&s;s was &s;o &s;low in the &s;truggle
with the waves, that we feared night would
overtake us before we could reach the
&s;hore; and every per&s;on in the boat becom|ing
&s;en&s;ible of the danger, &s;eized the oar,
and relieved each other by turns.</P>
<P>After much terror on my part, and much
labor on that of my fellow travellers, per|haps
mingled with a wi&s;h, that they had
<PB N="258" REF="277">
left Europe to its fate till the next morn|ing,
we reached a di&s;tant part of the &s;hore,
where, &s;heltered from the tempe&s;t, which
continued with unabated fury, we coa&s;ted
it back, finding it impracticable to land,
and arrived at Maggedino towards the clo&s;e
of the evening. We were &s;till nine or ten
miles di&s;tant from Bellinzone, and were
hara&s;&s;ed and fatigued; but an ob&s;tacle pre|&s;ented
it&s;elf more in&s;urmountable than the
Gazettes to our remaining in this village,
which was the want of every kind of ac|commodation,
either of food or lodging.
We recollected al&s;o, that we were at the
foot of Mount Cenere, the haunt of robbers
and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins; and there was nothing in the
looks of tho&s;e we &s;aw around us to in&s;pire
confidence. While we were deliberating
what cour&s;e we &s;hould pur&s;ue, undecided be|tween
the danger of remaining in this in&s;u|lated
&s;pot, and the inconveniences we &s;hould
&s;uffer in braving the tempe&s;t, the cea&s;ing
<PB N="259" REF="278">
of the rain decided us to go on to Bel|linzone.</P>
<P>Unacquainted with the road, and afraid
to a&s;k a guide of the &s;urly ho&s;t, we had
not proceeded far, when it became &s;o dark,
that we could perceive no object, but by
the frequent fla&s;hes of lightning darting
from the livid clouds, while &s;ometimes the
menacing roar of torrents, ru&s;hing fre&s;h
from the hills acro&s;s our way, was unheard
amid&s;t loud bur&s;ts of thunder. We were
almo&s;t in a &s;ituation of as much danger as
on the lake, &s;ince we knew, that before we
reached Bellinzone, we had a con&s;iderable
&s;tream to cro&s;s, and feared, that &s;welled by
rains from the hills, it might have become
impa&s;&s;able. In this perplexity, a friendly
light appeared at a di&s;tance, which pro|ceeded
from the window of the Cur&eacute; of an
hamlet we were approaching. He invited
us to enter, but we put his politene&s;s to no
<PB N="260" REF="279">
further te&s;t than reque&s;ting his interpo&s;ition
with &s;ome of his pari&s;hioners for a guide,
which he immediately went to a neigh|bouring
hut to procure, and under his au|&s;pices
we reached, after midnight, Bellin|zone
and the journals.</P>
<P>Bellinzone, the joint property of the Can|tons
of Uri, Schweitz, and Under-walden,
was originally, like the other Italian baili|wicks,
part of the hereditary po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of
the Duke of Milan. In the beginning of
the fifteenth century the Barons of Mi&s;a, in
the Gri&s;ons, who had won this territory
from the Milane&s;e, &s;old it to the Cantons
of Uri and Underwalden, together with the
di&s;tricts of Bolleny and Riviera, for two
thou&s;and four hundred florins. The Duke
of Milan, de&s;irous of regaining this part of
his hereditary dominions, offered to pay the
Swi&s;s the money they had advanced, but
feeling that they had made a good bargain
<PB N="261" REF="280">
with the Barons of Saxe, they were not di&s;|po&s;ed
to treat upon the &s;ame terms with the
Duke of Milan, who, after much fruitle&s;s
negociation for the purcha&s;e, concluded the
affair by &s;eizing on this important key to
his &s;tates, which he took by &s;urpri&s;e. All
the Cantons, except Berne, armed to avenge
the outrage of thus po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing him&s;elf of a
town which had been bought and paid for;
but after a fierce &s;truggle, the Swi&s;s were
obliged to relinqui&s;h the conte&s;t, and left, in
the piles of bones that adorn the chapel of
St. Paul, near Bellinzone, the &s;cene of one of
their mo&s;t celebrated battles, a monument,
not only of their heroic valour, but perhaps
al&s;o of their folly, in pa&s;&s;ing their moun|tains
to mingle in the quarrels of other
&s;tates. After this &s;evere le&s;&s;on, the Swi&s;s,
convinced that no &s;olid advantages could
re&s;ult from the conflict, however gloriou&s;ly
maintained, concluded a peace with the
Duke of Milan in 1426, by which they
<PB N="262" REF="281">
&s;urrendered all their territory on the Italian
&s;ide of the Alps, on condition of being al|lowed
certain exclu&s;ive advantages in their
commerce with the Milane&s;e &s;tates, and re|ceiving
ten times the &s;um for which they
had purcha&s;ed Bellinzone. In the beginning
of the &s;ixteenth century, during the frequent
revolutions in Lombardy, the inhabitants
revolted, and placed them&s;elves under the
protection of the three Cantons; Sforza,
Duke of Milan, and Francis the Fir&s;t,
gave up their re&s;pective claims, and the
Swi&s;s have ever &s;ince retained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
this bailiwick.</P>
<P>Bellinzone is rich in fine churches dedi|cated
to St. Peter, St. Stephen, St. Blai&s;e,
and St. Rock; here are al&s;o numerous con|vents
of Aug&s;tines, Ur&s;ulines, and Recol|lects,
which we vi&s;ited under the au&s;pices
of a very intelligent and amiable emigrant
prie&s;t. There was little to attract the no|tice
<PB N="263" REF="282">
of travellers in the&s;e calm retreats of
ignorace and devotion; though the good
monk, who &s;hewed us the trea&s;ures of his
convent, &s;ituated beyond the German gate
of Bellinzone, intreated we would con&s;ider,
with attention, a picture hanging on the
wall of a chapel, which he a&s;&s;ured us was a
piece of &s;ingular value, being a true copy of
the Virgin, executed by one of the apo&s;tles,
and which, having been lo&s;t in Turkey,
was found &s;tuck in the walls of a church at
Rome, without the aid of any vi&s;ible agent
to tran&s;port it thither. He was proceeding
with &s;tedfa&s;t gravity, to give a large detail
of the hi&s;tory for our edification, when he
under&s;tood, by the blu&s;h which aro&s;e in the
countenance of our more &s;agacious prie&s;t,
for the honor of his religion, degraded by
&s;uch fables, that the miracle was breathed
into the ear of heretics.</P>
<P>We al&s;o vi&s;ited the convent, or rather &s;e|minary,
<PB N="264" REF="283">
called the Re&s;idence, where we
were received with the mo&s;t cordial polite|ne&s;s
by the &s;uperior, a man of erudition,
with amiable manners, and a much more
agreeable countenance and figure than was
nece&s;&s;ary for a monk. In this &s;eminary
there are profe&s;&s;ors of the languages, of mo|ral
and natural philo&s;ophy, and a library,
which, con&s;idering the &s;carcity of literature
in this country, was very re&s;pectable.
Young per&s;ons are boarded and educated for
about twelve pounds a-year, and the chil|dren
of the town and neighbourhood receive
their education without any expence. This
convent has been lately founded, for the
building is &s;carcely fini&s;hed, with a part of
the &s;uperfluous wealth of the Abbey of Ein|&s;ilden;
and happy would it have been if
mona&s;tic wealth and influence had always
been employed to &s;uch u&s;eful and beneficent
purpo&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="284">
The &s;uperior, who has the title of pre|vot,
has written a manual of education for
the democratic Cantons, of which he pre|&s;ented
us with a copy. Admi&s;&s;ion to the
interior of this convent is not allowed to fe|males;
and the exception in my favour was
a privilege of no little di&s;tinction; &s;ome of
the long galleries, at the end of which we
pa&s;&s;ed, were, however, forbidden ground
to a female foot, as I perceived, by the po|lite
ob&s;ervation of the &s;uperior, that his ju|ri&s;diction
extended only to certain parts of
the hou&s;e, one of which was his own pri|vate
apartment, where we found not only
books in great profu&s;ion, but ho&s;pitable re|fre&s;hments
of every kind.</P>
<P>The admini&s;tration of this province, like
tho&s;e of Lugano and Locarno, is remitted
every two years to a new bailiff. As this event
was about to take place, we remained a few
days longer, in order to ob&s;erve whether the
<PB N="266" REF="285">
Mu&s;es of Bellinzone twined laurels round
their bailiff's brow with as lavi&s;h profu&s;ion
as tho&s;e of Lugano. The morning of this
di&s;tingui&s;hed day was &s;pent in mar&s;halling
&s;uch of the inhabitants and officers of &s;tate
as were to go out to meet the new bailiff,
and conduct him in proce&s;&s;ion to his new
government. In the evening we beheld the
augu&s;t train, glittering in long gold-laced
cloaks, mounted on fiery cour&s;ers, and pre|ceded
by trumpets, winding along the val|ley.
On their approach within &s;ight of the
town, the cannon on the ramparts of the
three ca&s;tles fired alternately a long &s;alute,
the roar of which, re-echoing amid&s;t the
mountains in a va&s;t variety of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive
&s;ounds, was by far the mo&s;t intere&s;ting part
of the ceremony.</P>
<P>The next morning, after the celebration
of ma&s;s, the new bailiff was in&s;talled
with nearly the &s;ame &s;olemnity as at Lu|gano,
<PB N="267" REF="286">
with re&s;pect to form, but with le&s;s
&s;plendor as to the effect. Few appeared to
feel any intere&s;t in the confecration, except
tho&s;e who were immediately concerned in
the di&s;tribution of the power or the profits
of this high dignity, the amount of which
la&s;t, we under&s;tood, was incon&s;iderable,
when the compliments were deducted that
are paid by the new bailiff to his brother
&s;overeigns on his nomination. Singular
anecdotes are related of the frank and un|di&s;gui&s;ed
manner in which the&s;e matters are
arranged at the place of election, and which
di&s;play the character of &startq;that fierce demo|cracy&endq;
in no very proud point of view.</P>
<P>The knowledge of tho&s;e hi&s;tories is not
lo&s;t on the people, and it is ea&s;y to perceive
that they begin to regard their bailiffs rather
as tax-gatherers, legali&s;ed to plunder them,
than upright di&s;tributors of ju&s;tice, the pre|&s;ervers
of their pro&s;perity and peace.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="287">
Of the virtues or excellencies of the new
governor nothing had yet tran&s;pired, but
we were left in no uncertainty re&s;pecting
tho&s;e of the ex-bailiff, Don France&s;co
Aloi&s;co Wir&s;ch, of the illu&s;trious Republic
of Underwald, and fir&s;t captain of the
Swi&s;s regiment of Underwald in Spain, in
who&s;e prai&s;es we found the bards of Bel|linzone
even more &s;ublimely tuneful than
the lyrics of Lugano. The poets laureat of
Captain Zeltner had only rai&s;ed him above
Alexander, and made him merely equal to
the gods, comparing the triumphs of So|leure
to tho&s;e of Athens and Sparta, and
thus bounding our imagination to the he|roes
of Greece and Macedonia; but Captain
Wir&s;ch's poet, rai&s;ed into more than Virgi|lian
rapture, with &startq;a ma&s;ter's hand and
prophet's fire,&endq; thus &s;trikes the immortal
&s;tring:</P>
<P>Exult, break forth in &s;ongs&mdash;O, Under|walden,
<PB N="269" REF="288">
for thy great &s;on returns to his na|tive
&s;hores&mdash;what an immortal &s;plendor
gracefully plays around him! alike only to
him&s;elf, &startq;none but him&s;elf can be his pa|rallel.&endq;
&mdash;The Holy Virgin de&s;cending from
heaven, the object of our adoration and
wor&s;hip, takes him by the hand, and be|&s;tows
on him a profu&s;ion of tender care&s;&s;es.
O, Underwalden, after Wir&s;ch, the object
of our idolatry, &s;end us another &s;oul of
cele&s;tial mold, for &s;ouls of cele&s;tial mold
are the prolific produce of thy happy &s;oil.</P>

<P>Such is the &s;tyle of panegyric, with
which the&s;e &s;ubtle Italians attempt to &s;often
the native hardne&s;s of their German bailiffs,
and &s;eek to wheedle &s;ucceeding governors
into courteous behaviour, by per&s;uading Mr.
Zeltner, that he is equal to the gods, from
whom he de&s;cended, and Mr. Wir&s;ch, that
he is like no one but him&s;elf, and the favo|rite

at the expence of bailiffs, we &s;hould

<P>The conquered nations of A&s;ia, we are
told by the hi&s;torians, were the fir&s;t inven|tors
of this &s;ervile mode of paneygric, and
the governors of tho&s;e provinces its fir&s;t
objects. The Roman procon&s;ul, who de|parted
a citizen from the free and equal &s;eat
of government, became at once a provincial
divinity, with altars and &s;acrifices. We
blu&s;h to hear Cicero reque&s;ting his brother
Quintius to con&s;truct a temple to his fame,
or increa&s;e the number of his &s;tatues. The
&s;ubjects of Lugano &s;ooth their conquerors
by cheaper arts, the labors of the &s;ong. The
principle of Swi&s;s government in the&s;e bai|liwicks,
is, no doubt, contrary to every in|&s;titution
of liberty; yet as in &s;ome reli|gions
the conduct of their profe&s;&s;ors is often
more humane than their creed, &s;o in the&s;e

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Hi&s;tory of an Emigrant Family.</HEAD>
<P>OUR excur&s;ions, in the neigbourhood of
Bellinzone, had more than the charms of
new and &s;ublime &s;cenery to imprint them
on my memory: a moral intere&s;t has im|pre&s;&s;ed
them on my heart. There accident
led me to the dwelling of Madame C&mdash;;
and I cannot re&s;i&s;t indulging my&s;elf by re|lating
the incident, to which I owe the few
&s;hort, but well-remembered hours, which
were gilded by the charm of her &s;ociety. I
will not name the valley, where I found
her, and by &s;o doing expo&s;e her cottage to
the profane gaze of curio&s;ity: but without
di&s;covering her abode, I may &s;afely de&s;cribe
its &s;ituation; &s;ince in that romantic country,
how many cottages are placed, like hers,
<PB N="274" REF="293">
near the &s;teep bank of a torrent &s;tream, &s;ur|rounded
by luxuriant vegetation, veiled by
fe&s;toons of vines, &s;heltered above by the
hanging woods of fir and pine, and bounded
far beyond by the bare rock, and the &s;hin|ing
Glacier.</P>
<P>In one of our rambles, at &s;ome di&s;tance
from Bellinzone, we a&s;cended a mountain,
the &s;ummit of which, we were told, com|manded
a pro&s;pect that would repay us for
the toil. The path, however, we found,
not merely &s;teep, but &s;o rugged, that before
we had a&s;cended half way, we were obliged
to alight from our hor&s;es, and the evening
being too far advanced to admit of our
reaching the &s;ummit, and returning on foot
we agreed to walk down the mountain, and
take a ride along the valley. The gentle|men,
who were with me, led their hor&s;es,
our guide had charge of mine, and I fol|lowed
them down the narrow &s;hadowy
<PB N="275" REF="294">
path, &s;ometimes loitering behind to gaze
upon the wild and romantic character of the
&s;cene around me; &s;ometimes pau&s;ing to
catch the &s;hifting lights amid&s;t the rude
foliage, till I lo&s;t &s;ight of my fellow tra|vellers,
and &s;oon after reached a &s;pot where
two paths met. I could not recollect by
which we had mounted, and after &s;ome
he&s;itation took the wrong path, ha&s;tening
my pace, though the de&s;cent was difficult,
in hopes of rejoining my fellow-travellers.
After de&s;cending a con&s;iderable time with|out
meeting any human figure, or perceiv|ing
any human habitation, I reached at
length the ba&s;e of the mountain, where I
found &s;ome &s;cattered hamlets encircled with
vineyards, and entered them in &s;earch of a
guide. But the cottagers were at their la|bours
in the valley, and the&s;e little dwell|ings
were de&s;erted of their inhabitants. The
evening was now advancing, and Bellinzone
was too di&s;tant to be reached on foot till
<PB N="276" REF="295">
late in the night. Nor was the idea of a
&s;olitary walk in darkne&s;s agreeable, in a
country often infe&s;ted by banditti, who
find a retreat amid&s;t the wild haunts of
Mount Cenere.</P>
<P>About a league from Bellinzone, we had
been &s;hewn the &s;pot where a traveller was
murdered a week before our arrival; and
we had &s;een a picture&s;que promontory of
the lovely Lake of Lugano, deformed by
the hideous &s;pectacle of two men hung in
gibbets. The character of the lower order
of people, amid&s;t tho&s;e mountains, had ap|peared
to us &s;omewhat &s;avage; and al|though
I &s;hould have felt my&s;elf perfectly
&s;afe under the &s;helter of a Swi&s;s cottage, on
the other &s;ide of the Alps, I had here no
&s;uch per&s;ua&s;ion of &s;ecurity. After &s;ome deli|beration,
I determined to wait near the cot|tages
for the return of the labourers; and if
my fellow travellers, who were doubtle&s;s in
<PB N="277" REF="296">
&s;earch of me, did not arrive before that
time, to hire an hor&s;e and guide to Bellin|zone.
I &s;at down on the fragment of a
rock, mu&s;ing on the &s;ingularity of my &s;itua|tion,
when I heard the approach of foot|&s;teps,
behind me, and turning my head,
&s;aw a lady and gentleman coming along a
narrow path, which led to the &s;pot where
I was &s;eated. I ro&s;e immediately, and ad|vanced
towards them, related my adven|ture,
and a&s;ked their advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance.
The lady, taking my hand with a &s;weet
&s;mile, and a look of benevolence, told me
how fortunate &s;he con&s;idered her&s;elf in be|ing
able to render me any &s;ervice. After
making known her name, which denoted
high nobility, this emigrant lady, for &s;uch
&s;he was, intreated me to allow her to con|duct
me to her cottage, which was within
a few paces of the &s;pot where we &s;tood;
but per&s;uaded that my fellow travellers
were in &s;earch of me, I preferred remaining
<PB N="278" REF="297">
within &s;ight of the road, and was anxious
to lo&s;e no time in taking mea&s;ures for re|turning
to Bellinzone.</P>
<P>It was agreed, that a pea&s;ant of a neigh|bouring
cottage, whom the lady told me
&s;he could &s;afely recommend, &s;hould procure
me an hor&s;e, and convey me to Bellinzone;
the gentleman regretting that illne&s;s put it
out of his power to conduct me him&s;elf;
the truth of which a&s;&s;ertion his pale coun|tenance
and emaciated figure &s;ufficiently
evinced. While we were arranging the&s;e
matters, a little ro&s;y-cheeked boy, of three
years of age, who had been &s;porting up and
down the mountain-path, as lightly as the
playful chamois, came &s;pringing to his
mama, and announced the approach of
&s;trangers. A few minutes after my fellow
travellers, who had re-a&s;cended the moun|tain
a con&s;iderable way in &s;earch of me, by
a different path from that which I had
<PB N="279" REF="298">
taken, appeared: the hor&s;es were waiting
in a little nook, at no great di&s;tance, and I
ha&s;tily took leave of my new acquaintances,
but not till the lady, who bade me fare|well,
with kind reluctance, had made me
promi&s;e to return with my friends the next
morning, to breakfa&s;t at her cottage.</P>
<P>During our ride home, and the whole of
the evening; I could think and talk of no|thing
but the charming countenance of
Madame de C&mdash;: I tried it by all the
rules of Lavater, and was probably a better
phy&s;iognomi&s;t than u&s;ual, having &s;o lately
heard the &s;ubject de&s;canted with a ma&s;ter's
art; for it is certain, that on this occa&s;ion,
my judgment was unerring.</P>
<P>The next morning we &s;et out to break|fa&s;t
at the cottage: my &s;pirits were exhila|rated
with the thoughts of vi&s;iting my
new acquaintance, and I enjoyed more than
<PB N="280" REF="299">
u&s;ually the beauties of the wild romantic
valley, along which we rode, and which
was gilded with gay &s;un&s;hine. A torrent
&s;tream rolls noi&s;ily over its &s;tony bed in the
mid&s;t of this woody vale, which is rich
with pa&s;turage, and bounded on each &s;ide
by lofty rocks and mountains, while that
chain of Glaciers, from which the Rhine
pours its &s;ource, lift their eternal &s;nows in
the di&s;tance, and cool the air in the valley.</P>
<P>Fragments of rock were &s;trewed on the
edge of our path, and on one &s;pot the
ve&s;tiges of an avalanche appeared in heaps
of ma&s;&s;y &s;tones, mingled with the ruins of
deva&s;tated cottages, and gave a &s;avage wild|ne&s;s
to the &s;cene. Soon after cro&s;&s;ing a
light arched bridge, over-grown with la|vi&s;h
folds of ivy, we reached the mountain,
at the foot of which was placed the vine|covered
cottage of Madame C&mdash;: her
&s;weet little boy &s;tood at the door, watching
<PB N="281" REF="300">
for our arrival. He danced with delight,
while we di&s;mounted; and the moment he
could reach me, gracefully ki&s;&s;ed my hand,
which is one of the fir&s;t things little French
boys are taught to do, and then galloped
away in &s;earch of his mama.</P>
<P>The cottage, which was perfectly neat,
contained a little plain furniture, two frames
filled with ornamental work, a table heaped
with drawings, and a &s;mall &s;helf, on which
a few books were ranged. Madame de
C&mdash;received us with animated plea|&s;ure,
and her hu&s;band expre&s;&s;ed as much &s;a|tisfaction
as the languor of ill health &s;eemed
to admit. Victoire, a &s;mart brown girl,
whom on a Swi&s;s mountain, or in any other
remote region, where I had met her, I
&s;hould immediately have recognized by a
gracefully familiar ea&s;e of manner, temper|ed
with the mo&s;t profound re&s;pect, for a
Pari&s;ian <HI>fille de chambre,</HI> prepared the break|fa&s;t
<PB N="282" REF="301">
fa&s;t with a light ela&s;tic &s;tep, and a look of
chearful alacrity.</P>
<P>Madame de C&mdash;'s conver&s;ation &s;hed
flowers over the repa&s;t; there was &s;omething
like enchantment in finding in a rude ham|let,
at the foot of &s;avage rocks, and untrod|den
Glaciers, the mo&s;t poli&s;hed graces of
intellectual culture; and united with a &s;u|perior
under&s;tanding, with a ta&s;te for all
that is elegant in the arts, and an enthu&s;ia&s;m
for all that is &s;ublime in nature, that cordial
warmth of manner, that fa&s;cinating frank|ne&s;s,
when the &s;oul &s;eems to hang upon the
lips, and the glowing expre&s;&s;ion of its &s;en|&s;ibility
exerts an irre&s;i&s;tible influence over
the hearts of others. Mon&s;. de C&mdash;,
an amiable and accompli&s;hed man, appeared
to be in a &s;tate of dejection, which it co&s;t
him an effort to conceal, but which his wife
was evidently at pains to cheer. After
breakfa&s;t, Madame C&mdash;propo&s;ed a walk
<PB N="283" REF="302">
amid&s;t &s;ome of the wilde&s;t haunts of that
romantic region, where &s;he told me &s;he &s;el|dom
met any human creature, and therefore
con&s;idered that portion of the valley as her
own territory.</P>
<P>Before we &s;et out, Victoire, who &s;eemed
not a little anxious to know &startq;my opinion
of things in general&endq; at Paris, was &s;o ex|tremely
voluble in her inquiries, that I
found it impo&s;&s;ible for my an&s;wers to keep
any pace with her que&s;tions. Victoire's mind
was fertile in &s;uppo&s;itions, as well as in|quiries;
&s;he &s;uppo&s;ed the mon&s;ters had, by
this time, &s;own all the Tuilleries with pota|toes,
and dug up the hou&s;es as well as the
cellars for &s;alt-petre, and made all the wo|men
wear red caps; as if it was not bad
enough to be forced to &s;tick on &agrave; cockade,
or be dragged to pri&s;on by tho&s;e horrid
<HI>&s;ans-culottes,</HI> calling them&s;elves Brutus and
Ari&s;tides. She &s;uppo&s;ed too they &s;till went
<PB N="284" REF="303">
on with their &s;aucy <HI>tutoiment</HI> and <HI>citoyenne,</HI>
to the women&mdash;&s;he did not know why the
brutes dared to call her <HI>citoyenne,</HI> &s;he, who
had lived all her life at Ver&s;ailles, and wait|ed
only on court ladies.</P>
<P>Victoire proceeded in her ob&s;ervations till
I interrupted her by remarking, that &s;he
mu&s;t no doubt find her&s;elf very happy at
&s;uch a &s;afe di&s;tance from Paris, among tho&s;e
fine mountains.&mdash;&startq;Ah, Madame,&endq; inter|rupted
Victoire, &startq;happy among the &s;a|vages
here, who can't &s;peak one word of
French!&mdash;Oh, what I would &s;ometimes
give for a walk upon the Boulevards! I am
&s;o tired of rocks and &s;nows!&mdash;if it was
not for the plea&s;ure of &s;erving my dear
lady, I believe I &s;hould go back and have
my head cut off&mdash;for I'm too well known
in Paris to e&s;cape&mdash;and yet, I mu&s;t own
the truth, I did all I could to make my
lady come away; for certainly, when all
<PB N="285" REF="304">
the <HI>haute noble&s;&s;e</HI> were gone, my lady, as I
told her, was not made to &s;tay behind&mdash;
and, indeed,&endq; added Victoire, &startq;I was
a&s;hamed my&s;elf of being &s;een in Paris, for
all the <HI>femmes de chambres</HI> of my acquaint|ance
had emigrated an age before.&endq; Upon
the whole I ob&s;erved, from Victoire's con|ver&s;ation,
that her wrath and indignation
again&s;t the Jacobins was almo&s;t entirely
confined to their <HI>gro&s;&s;i&eacute;ret&eacute;;</HI> as for their
cruelty, that &s;eemed to come within the
pale of her forgivene&s;s; but to put inno|cent
people to death, and be <HI>mal-honn&ecirc;te,
en outre,</HI> &s;he con&s;idered as quite unpardon|able.</P>
<P>After a delightful ramble amid&s;t the pic|ture&s;que
&s;cenes of that wild country, Ma|dame
C&mdash;and my&s;elf &s;eated our&s;elves on
a &s;pot of turf, and left the re&s;t of the company
to extend their walk. Here, laying a&s;ide
the tone of general conver&s;ation, Madame
<PB N="286" REF="305">
de C&mdash;related to me the particulars of
her &s;ituation, which &s;he probably &s;aw I was
anxious to know, more from a &s;entiment of
&s;ympathy, than a principle of curio&s;ity.
Nor &s;hould it be thought &s;ingular that &s;he
confided her &s;tory to a &s;tranger; even an
Engli&s;h woman, in that di&s;tant region,
&s;urrounded only by half-civilized moun|taineers,
would have felt confidence &s;pring|ing
in her bo&s;om towards a per&s;on who
could under&s;tand and pity her feelings; but
it required le&s;s than the &s;olitude of Alpine
mountains to have led Madame C&mdash;to
unfold her heart. The French are natu|rally
communicative; they neither practice,
nor comprehend, that re&s;erve which be|longs
to the Engli&s;h character, and which
&s;ometimes has its &s;ource in delicacy, &s;ome|times
in pride.</P>
<P>Whatever the French feel or &s;uffer, hope
or fear is readily imparted to the whole cir|cle
<PB N="287" REF="306">
of their &s;ociety; even per&s;onal infirmi|ties
and mental defects, of which the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or
happens to be con&s;cious, are all made
known without he&s;itation; poverty it&s;elf,
which in England we are &s;o careful to con|ceal,
co&s;ts the French no &s;uch trouble; nor
have they any idea of enduring the &s;malle&s;t
privation, in order to hide their circum|&s;tances
or make a better appearance to the
world.</P>
<P>But to return to Madame C&mdash;, who
was the daughter of a nobleman of high
rank, and who, at &s;ixteen years of age, had
married Mon&s;. C&mdash;, by whom &s;he was
pa&s;&s;ionately beloved. That Madame C&mdash;
was beloved, I could very ea&s;ily believe,
while I di&s;cerned the graces of her mind,
and beheld the fine expre&s;&s;ion of her coun|tenance,
form which &s;orrow, not time, for
&s;he was now only in her twenty-fourth
year, had &s;natched the fir&s;t fre&s;h tints of
<PB N="288" REF="307">
beauty, but had left an expre&s;&s;ion which
blended a more tender &s;entiment with ad|miration.
Mon&s;. C&mdash;, who dete&s;ted
the principles of the revolution as cordially
as mo&s;t men of the &s;ame rank, was only
prevented from emigrating when fir&s;t that
event took place, by the repre&s;entations of
his wife, who&s;e more enlarged mind exult|ed
in that change of &s;y&s;tem which &s;he dared
not openly applaud: &s;he had often wept over
the mi&s;eries of the oppre&s;&s;ed people, and was
more di&s;po&s;ed to rejoice in the amelioration
of &s;olid &s;ub&s;tantial wretchedne&s;s, than to la|ment
the ideal deprivations of greatne&s;s.
After the memorable tenth of Augu&s;t, &s;he
had no longer power, however, to re&s;train
her hu&s;band from emigrating, and con&s;ider|ing
it as her fir&s;t duty to follow his for|tunes,
and &s;hare his de&s;tiny, &s;he was only
prevented from going with him by his de|&s;ire
that &s;he &s;hould endeavour to pre&s;erve
their property, by remaining in France till
<PB N="289" REF="308">
the counter-revolution arrived, which he
was firmly per&s;uaded was at no great di&s;|&s;tance.
After making the tour of Switzer|land,
he cro&s;&s;ed the Alps with a party of
emigrants, and finding, that although the
counter-revolution was on its way, its
march was le&s;s rapid than he had expected,
determined to wait for that event at Bellin|zone.
Not long after, that ferocious ty|ranny
with its train of horrors, to which
regal de&s;poti&s;m was mild, and all its abu&s;es
light, e&s;tabli&s;hed it&s;elf in France. Madame
de C&mdash;'s corre&s;pondence became every
day more difficult and dangerous, and at
length the friend to whom his letters were
addre&s;&s;ed declared, that if this epi&s;tolary in|tercour&s;e
was continued, it would lead not
only him&s;elf, but Madame C&mdash;, to the
&s;caffold.</P>
<P>Deprived of all communication with her
hu&s;band, and a melancholy witne&s;s of
<PB N="290" REF="309">
crimes which &s;he execrated, and of mi&s;eries
which &s;he deplored, &s;he &s;oon became her|&s;elf
involved in the general calamity. All
the property of Mon&s;. C&mdash;was &s;eque&s;|tered,
and the &s;eals were placed upon every
apartment of his hotel, after a &s;trict &s;earch
had been made for Madame C&mdash;, who
e&s;caped impri&s;onment by having found a
temporary &s;helter for her&s;elf and her little
boy, in the hou&s;e of her friend. This per&s;on,
a man of &s;en&s;e and virtue, who, abhorrent
of the &s;anguinary mea&s;ures which then pre|vailed,
had, from circum&s;tances of a private
nature, &s;ome influence with one high in
power, and was ever ready to employ that
influence for the purpo&s;e of doing good, or
rather of averting evil, found means to
&s;natch Madame C&mdash;from danger, by
obtaining pa&s;&s;ports for her and Victoire, as
the wives of two Swi&s;s traders, who had
come to Paris upon affairs of commerce,
and were returning to their own country.
<PB N="291" REF="310">
Madame C&mdash;, after thanking her friend
for life, &s;ince life was then included in the
gift of a pa&s;&s;port, &s;et off in the diligence to
Ba&s;il, with her little boy in her arms, and
accompanied by Victoire.</P>
<P>During the journey Madame C&mdash;had
many alarms on account of the intemperate
re&s;entments of her waiting-woman, who,
whenever any incident happened by which
&s;he was offended, was ready to betray all.
Victoire was a&s;toni&s;hed that nobody found
out that &s;he was the <HI>femme de chambre</HI> of
the lady of a <HI>cordon rouge,</HI> and was as an|gry
at what &s;he con&s;idered as di&s;re&s;pect, to
u&s;e the words of John&s;on, as &startq;the Czar
of Mu&s;covy, when he pa&s;&s;ed through Swe|den
in di&s;gui&s;e.&endq; It required many a private
lecture, during the route, from Madame
C&mdash;, to make Victoire pre&s;erve the in|cognita;
&s;he longed to bur&s;t upon the im|pertinent
fellow-travellers, who greeted her
<PB N="292" REF="311">
with <HI>tu toi, citoyenne,</HI> and <HI>egalit&eacute;,</HI> with a
detail of all the former &s;plendour of her
lady, a large portion of which &s;he con&s;i|dered
as reflected upon her&s;elf. She owned
that &s;he was dying to tell them, that they
were not fit comany for the anti-chamber,
and that this was the fir&s;t time &s;he her&s;elf
had ever travelled in a diligence. Madame
C&mdash;promi&s;ed Victoire that &s;he &s;hould
tell all, and act the duche&s;s if &s;he plea&s;ed,
when once they had pa&s;&s;ed the frontier, but
conjured her in the mean time, if &s;he valued
her life, to be &s;ilent; this, however, did
not prevent Victoire from declaring to an
inn-keeper, who &s;he thought had u&s;ed too
familiar a tone, that &s;he would take care to
prevent Mon&s;ieur from ever employing his
hou&s;e again; upon which &s;he was heartily
abu&s;ed as the diligence drove off, and met
with the u&s;ual Jacobin reproof for making
u&s;e of that appellation, by beig told that
Mon&s;ieur was at Coblentz.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="312">
Madame C&mdash;, in &s;pite of the impru|dent
&s;allies of her waiting-woman, and
&s;ome inquiries in the artle&s;s accents of her
little boy after his papa's coach and four,
reached Ba&s;il in &s;afety, where &s;he had no
&s;ooner taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an apartment at
the inn, than Victoire endeavoured to com|pen&s;ate
her&s;elf for the re&s;traints of the
journey, by bawling out her mi&s;tre&s;s's ti|tles
to every waiter in the hou&s;e, and re|counting,
with extraordinary volubility, the
indignities they had &s;uffered on the road.
Poor Victoire, however, met with far le&s;s
&s;ympathy than &s;he expected, her mi&s;tre&s;s
having, unfortunately for the effect of her
harangues, &s;topped at the Three Kings,
which is the re&s;ort of the French Repub|licans,
in&s;tead of going to the Stork, which
is &s;upported by the French Emigrants, and
where her tales of plebeian impertinence
would have produced a becoming horror.</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="313">
After one night's repo&s;e, Madame C&mdash;
having written to announce her arrival to
her hu&s;band, and intreat him to meet her
at Lucerne, immediately proceeded thither.
Two days &s;he waited impatiently at Lu|cerne
without any tidings of Mon&s;. C&mdash;,
and fearing that her letter had mi&s;carried,
determined, without further delay, to cro&s;s
the Alps, and joyfully &s;urprize him by her
appearance at Bellinzone. As &s;he drew
near that city her heart &s;welled with al|mo&s;t
incontrolable emotion&mdash;her hu&s;band
had, in &s;ome of his fir&s;t letters to her, de|&s;cribed
the land&s;cape &s;o much in detail,
that every object &s;eemed to bring his image
more vividly to her mind. As &s;he pa&s;&s;ed
over the bridge, about a mile from the
town, and &s;aw at a little di&s;tance on the
right the Moe&s;a and the Te&s;&s;ino mingling
their &s;treams together, &s;he recollected his
having told her, that often on the &s;pot
where their waters met, he leant whole
<PB N="295" REF="314">
hours in melancholy mu&s;ing over their
blended currents. She gazed eagerly, as &s;he
approached the town, at the three frowning
ca&s;tles that crown the lofty hills, where &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively
re&s;ide the &s;overeign bailiffs of the
&s;ubject valley in which Bellinzone is
placed. Mon&s;. C&mdash;had climbed the&s;e
hills, had traced the &s;cene inclo&s;ed between
their rocky heights, and &s;tretching beyond
the romantic valley leading to the Italian
part of the Gri&s;on territory. Mad. C&mdash;
pa&s;&s;ed through the gates of Bellinzone, her
heart throbbing with tho&s;e overwhelming,
tho&s;e delicious &s;en&s;ations, which are felt
when we expect, in a few &s;hort moments,
again to behold the object of our deare&s;t
affections, after a &s;eparation embittered by
the pangs of calamity, and the apprehen|&s;ions
of danger. Tho&s;e delightful emotions
flu&s;hed her cheek with the glow of ani|mated
hope, and bathed her eyes with tho&s;e
luxurious tears, which are the attribute of
<PB N="296" REF="315">
tender happine&s;s. Madame C&mdash;, with
her little &s;uite, rode up to the inn, where her
hu&s;band lived at Bellinzone, and eagerly
looked round as &s;he di&s;mounted, in hopes
that her letters had by this time arrives,
and that the trampling of the hor&s;es feet
had led him to the door; for her heart told
her how wakefully, had he been expected,
&s;he would have li&s;tened to every &s;ound
that could denote his approach, and how
quickly &s;he would have &s;prung to welcome
him.</P>
<P>&startq;Where is Mon&s;. C&mdash;?&endq; &s;he in|quired,
with precipitation, not &s;eeing him

inn informed her, had left their hou&s;e three
months &s;ince.&mdash;&startq; Where, where is he
gone?&endq; exclaimed Madame C&mdash;, her
heart &s;ickening with di&s;appointment.&mdash;He
was gone to Con&s;tance; but this was not
all&mdash;he was gone with Madame&mdash;,
<PB N="297" REF="316">
who found Bellinzone too dull for a longer
re&s;idence. Madame C&mdash;, without utter|ing
another word, followed the inn-keeper
into the hou&s;e, but before &s;he had reached
the apartment allotted for her fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s
on the ground: &s;he was carried into her
chamber, and laid upon a bed, where, on
recovering, &s;he found Victoire anxiou&s;ly
watching at her &s;ide. The unfortunate
Madame C&mdash;was only re&s;tored to a di&s;|tracting
&s;en&s;e of mi&s;ery; of a &s;pecies of
mi&s;ery, which her feeling heart was lea&s;t
able to &s;u&s;tain, that of being for&s;aken by
him, whom &s;he loved with the mo&s;t ten|der,
the mo&s;t inviolable attachment.</P>
<P>Involved in the con&s;equences of his emi|gration,
&s;he had been forced to bid a final
adieu to her country; her country, which
&s;he believed would one day &s;hake off the
horrible tyranny under which it then groan|ed,
and which &s;he abandoned for ever with
<PB N="298" REF="317">
regret; &s;ince &s;he felt powerfully that local
attachment, which a cold &s;upercilious phi|lo&s;ophy
may call prejudice, but of which a
mind of &s;en&s;ibility is ever &s;trongly &s;u&s;cepti|ble;
in con&s;equence of his emigration &s;he
had lo&s;t all chance of retaining that ample
property, which was the &s;plendid inherit|ance
of her child: without &s;haring the in|temperate
violence of his political opinions,
&s;he had determined to &s;hare his misfor|tunes,
and &s;often that eternal exile to which
&s;he flew with reluctance, but which had
been his voluntary choice. To be for&s;aken
by him, for&s;aken at the very moment when
mutual confidence, and un&s;haken fidelity
and attachment, were the dear &s;ole refuge
left again&s;t the &s;torms of fate, was angui&s;h
in&s;upportable. How keenly did her break|ing
heart feel the &s;entiment, which our di|vine
poet has expre&s;&s;ed&mdash;</P>
<Q><PB N="299" REF="318">
<L>&startq;Had it plea&s;ed heaven</L>

<P>Madame C&mdash;knew too well the cha|racter
of the lady, who was the companion
of her hu&s;band's flight, to doubt of his in|fidelity.
Madame de&mdash;was a Pari&s;ian
lady of high rank, who had been di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
in the ancient regime for the bril|liancy
of her coteries, and the number of
her adorers. Exqui&s;itely &s;killed in all
tho&s;e meretricious arts, which too often
captivate the &s;en&s;es of the Lords of Crea|tion,
without leave of their rea&s;on, and even
in oppo&s;ition to all their better feelings,
Madame de&mdash;had for many years en|chained
<PB N="300" REF="319">
in quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion more captives
than &s;he could count at her triumphal car;
had di&s;turbed the peace of a great number
of families; had broken the heart of many
a tender female, from whom &s;he had
alienated the affections of a beloved hu&s;|band,
by tho&s;e &s;eductions which &s;pread an
aliuring drapery over the form of vice,
and render the &s;imple charms of virtuous
love in&s;ipid to the vitiated fancy. Madame
de&mdash;was publicly known to be a wo|man
of galantry, but this by no means pre|vented
her being perfectly well received
in the fir&s;t circles of fa&s;hion, where &s;he was
certain to find many who rivaled her in li|centious
di&s;po&s;itions, but none who eclip&s;ed
her in Circean graces.</P>
<P>Though her youth was now pa&s;t, her
per&s;on was &s;till attractive, and her gaiety
and wit were inexhau&s;tible. The revolu|tion
di&s;&s;olved Madame de&mdash;'s coteries,
<PB N="301" REF="320">
di&s;per&s;ed her adorers, transformed Paris
into a new region, where the altars of plea|&s;ure
were overthrown, where incen&s;e was
offered at the &s;hrine of a new godde&s;s, and
where Madame de&mdash;was &s;tunned from
morning till night with the enthu&s;ia&s;tic ac|clamations
of the vulgar, whom &s;he had
been accu&s;tomed to con&s;ider as only born for
&s;lavery and &s;ilence; and who now, lifting
up their hoar&s;e voices, for ever thundered
in her ear from every quarter the &s;ounds of
liberty, and the rights of man.</P>
<P>The morning, after the fir&s;t Federation,
di&s;gu&s;ted with that &s;pectacle of happine&s;s,
and &s;ickening at the recollection of tho&s;e
&s;houts of exultation, which aro&s;e in uni&s;on
from half a million of a&s;&s;embled people,
Madame de&mdash;ordered po&s;t-hor&s;es, and
&s;et out for London. Her chief &s;olace in
that capital con&s;i&s;ted in amu&s;ing her former
Engli&s;h acquaintances at Paris, by whom
<PB N="302" REF="321">
&s;he was well received, with &s;piteful plea|&s;antries
upon the new order of things,
fanciful definitions of liberty, and ludicrous
&s;ketches of the raw parti-coloured volun|teers,
who, &s;ince Madame de&mdash;drew
their pictures, have &s;caled the Alps, and
changed the face of Europe.</P>
<P>While that lady was enlivening the vari|ous
tea-tables where &s;he vi&s;ited, with well|turned
epigrams on democracy, &s;he was
&s;ummoned by her friends to ha&s;ten in&s;tantly
to France, in order to &s;ave her property
from confi&s;cation, and her&s;elf from being
comprized in the law, which placed tho&s;e
per&s;ons on the fatal li&s;t of emigrants, who
did not return within a &s;tated time. Madame
de&mdash;, however, with full confidence in
her own powers of extricating her&s;elf from
all &s;crapes, and overcoming all ob&s;tacles,
loitered in London till the day of grace was
pa&s;t. She at length came to Paris, and
<PB N="303" REF="322">
opened her career in that city, by playfully
je&s;ting in &s;ociety, even with per&s;ons in au|thority,
on the &s;ubject of her emigration,
the events of the revolution, and her own
patriotic principles. But the bloody arena
of revolutionary government was at that
time prepared, the victims were already
marked, the horrid forms of death were
about to be let loo&s;e, and Madame de&mdash;'s
<HI>bons-mots,</HI> which were delightful in the
&s;afe vicinity of Gro&s;venor-&s;quare, appeared
very nearly allied to madne&s;s in the neigh|bourhood
of the &s;quare of the revolution:
as the flowering foliage of the light &s;hrub,
which &s;ports gracefully with the perfumed
zephyrs in the &s;heltered valley, a&s;&s;umes a
terrific character, when it waves over an
Alpine precipice. Madame de&mdash;find|ing,
that under the fear of the guillotine,
people were entirely in&s;en&s;ible to wit; and
at length being convinced, that all her
witcheries and enchantments would be lo&s;t
<PB N="304" REF="323">
upon the fierce demagogues who were about
to &s;eize the reins of power, and that &s;he was
even in &s;ome danger of the &s;caffold, &s;et off
for Switzerland with a fal&s;e pa&s;&s;port, ac|companied
by a young nobleman, who had
al&s;o procured one for the purpo&s;e of join|ing
the army of Cond&eacute;.</P>
<P>Madame de&mdash;had not &s;ucceeded in
&s;aving her property from &s;eque&s;tration, and
her pur&s;e was but lightly furni&s;hed when
&s;he left Paris; that of her fellow-traveller,
however, was well filled, and Madame de
&mdash;was rich in &s;pells &s;o potent, that for
her
<Q><L>&startq;The royal banner, and all quality,</L>
<L>Pride, pomp, and circum&s;tance of glorious war,&endq;</L></Q>
were forgotten, till his pur&s;e became as
vacant as her own, and &s;he then &s;uffered
him to leave her at Bellinzone&punc; and ha&s;ten
to the army with funds &s;carcely &s;ufficient
<PB N="305" REF="324">
to pay the expences of his journey. During
this interregnum in Madame de&mdash;'s
conque&s;ts, Mon&s;. C&mdash;, in evil hour,
arrived.</P>
<P>He was &s;ilent, dejected, and melancholy,
which little &s;uited Madame de&mdash;'s
ta&s;te, but he was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a large
&s;um of money, a circum&s;tance which was
not ill adapted to the &s;tate of her finances.
Madame de&mdash;&s;oon transformed her&s;elf
into a
<Q><L>&startq;Pen&s;ive nun, devout and pure,</L>
<L>Sober, &s;tedfa&s;t, and demure.&endq;</L></Q></P>
<P>It was a con&s;iderable time before her ar|tillery
of wiles made any impre&s;&s;ion on
Mon&s;. C&mdash;; her pride became piqued,
as well as her intere&s;t engaged, in atchieving
this new conque&s;t; and Mon&s;. C&mdash;, after
a &s;iege of con&s;iderable length, was added to
the number of her captives.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="325">
When her dominion was &s;ecurely e&s;ta|bli&s;hed,
&s;he in&s;i&s;ted upon leaving the &s;oli|tudes
of Bellinzone, of which &s;he had long
been heartily weary, for the more congenial
region of Con&s;tance, which, for di&s;&s;ipation
and plea&s;ure, vied with the Paris of former
times; and where Mon&s;. de C&mdash;'s pur&s;e
furni&s;hed her with all the means of volup|tuous
luxury.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the unfortunate Ma|dame
C&mdash;, heedle&s;s of the remon&s;trances
of her faithful Victoire, and indifferent to
the innocent prattle and &s;weet care&s;&s;es of
her child, pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome weeks at Bellinzone
in that &s;ituation of mind, when every care,
every affection, and every thought, are ab|&s;orbed
in one deep, powerful, overwhelm|ing
&s;entiment of mi&s;ery. She was rouzed
from this inactive de&s;pondency by finding
her&s;elf menaced with an evil which &s;he had
often pitied, but once had little chance of
<PB N="307" REF="326">
ever feeling; this evil was poverty; not
that figurative poverty which pines in arti|ficial
want, but the la&s;t terrible extreme of
real mi&s;ery; mi&s;ery which weighs with its
deepe&s;t pre&s;&s;ure on a mother's heart, when
&s;he hears the complaining voice of her
child, and has no power to &s;upply its nece&s;|&s;ities.
Madame C&mdash;had left France
with a &s;um of money little more than &s;uf|ficient
to defray the expences of her jour|ney;
but &s;he felt no anxiety on this ac|count,
as &s;he was going to join her hu&s;band,
who &s;he knew was provided, at his depar|ture,
with funds which mu&s;t &s;till be more
than &s;ufficient to &s;upply all pre&s;ent exigen|cies;
and for the future &s;he looked forward
to the efforts of their friend in France, to
re&s;cue &s;omething from the wreck of their
property.</P>
<P>Since her arrival at Bellinzone, &s;he had
thought little on the &s;ubject, for amid&s;t the
<PB N="308" REF="327">
fir&s;t &s;harp pangs of wounded affection, the
lacerated heart, only awake to one &s;en&s;ation,
turns with di&s;gu&s;t from all the cares, the
anxieties, and views of ordinary life; the
world &s;eems one wide cheerle&s;s de&s;art, and
all that it contains, except the object we
have lo&s;t, has no power to excite an emo|tion
of pain or plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>From this lethargy of de&s;pair Madame
C&mdash;was awakened, by Victoire telling
her that &s;he had heard that the inn at which
they lived was extremely expen&s;ive. She
immediately &s;ent for her bill, though with|out
much alarm, &s;ince her repa&s;ts had, &s;he
thought, been too &s;imple to be co&s;tly. The
amount of the bill, however, &s;o far exceed|ed
her expectation, that when it was paid,
a few remaining livres and a few trinkets
were the &s;ole property &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Ma|dame
C&mdash;looked at her child, and felt
that &s;he had no moments to lo&s;e; &s;he de|termined
<PB N="309" REF="328">
to leave the inn immediately, and
Victoire, after &s;ome re&s;earch, hired a &s;mall
chamber, containing too wretched beds, to
which &s;he retired. here Madame C&mdash;,
who had her whole life been nur&s;ed in the
bo&s;om of affluence, &s;carcely allowing her|&s;elf
the &s;canty &s;u&s;tenance which nature re|quires
for its pre&s;ervation, bathed her child
with tears of bitterne&s;s, till &s;ometimes the
infant caught the infectious &s;orrow, and
wept becau&s;e he &s;aw her weep. Sometimes
he inquired why his mama had no dinner;
and &s;ometimes a&s;ked why, &s;ince he was a
good boy, &s;he gave him no <HI>bons-bons</HI> now?
Victoire chearfully &s;hared her lady's dry
cru&s;t, and the only point on which they
differed was, that &s;he occa&s;ionally gave vent
to a &s;harp reflection on her ma&s;ter, which
Madame C&mdash;in&s;tantly repre&s;&s;ed; upon
which Victoire u&s;ually left the room, and
indulged her feelings, as well as her loqua|city,
<PB N="310" REF="329">
by relating the &s;tory, in terms little
mea&s;ured, to the whole neighbourhood.</P>
<P>Madame C&mdash;perceived with angui&s;h,
which can be ill defined, that, notwith&s;tand|ing
all the privations maternal tenderne&s;s
could devi&s;e or practi&s;e, her little funds
were almo&s;t entirely exhau&s;ted; and &s;he had
now recour&s;e to her watch and rings, as the
la&s;t means of averting want from her
child. Victoire was forced to part with
the&s;e relicks of former &s;plendor at a price
far below their value: alas! in &s;uch &s;ort of
conventions there is u&s;ually an unequal con|flict
between rapacity and di&s;tre&s;s; but at
that period the &s;ame &s;ad nece&s;&s;ity had forced
&s;o many unfortunate fugitives to relinqui&s;h,
like Madame C&mdash;, the appendages of de|parted
opulence, that the quantity of jewel&punc;
trinkets, and watches, offered for &s;ale in
Switzerland, had naturally dimini&s;hed their
worth.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="330">
With a trembling hand Madame C&mdash;
received the produce of her la&s;t re&s;ources,
while &s;he anticipated the moment, when
they would altogether fail. The people of
the town, where &s;he had alighted, had be|fore
her arrival, di&s;patched the letter to
Mon&s;. C&mdash;, which &s;he had &s;ent him
from Ba&s;il, but &s;he had received no tidings
of him in return; it was therefore evident,
that he was unaffected by her &s;ituation, that
he was carele&s;s of her fate, that he thought
of her no more! Amid&s;t the bitterne&s;s of
of tho&s;e reflections, how eagerly would &s;he
have welcomed that death to which he
abandoned her, but that &s;he mu&s;t leave her
child to peri&s;h. She had not neglected to
inform her friend in France of her circum|&s;tances;
but her letter, which it was death
to receive, had to travel by a route &s;o cir|cuitous,
and to pa&s;s through &s;o many hands
before it reached him, that nothing could
be more uncertain than its arrival.</P>
<P><PB N="312" REF="331">
With a frame languid from &s;uffering,
and a heart de&s;olate with de&s;pair, Madame
C&mdash;was one evening &s;itting in her
wretched &s;hed, lo&s;t in gloomy meditation,
when Victoire, who had been out in &s;earch
of their little daily &s;upplies, ha&s;tily entered
the room, and told her, that having been to
pay a vi&s;it to the people of the inn, where
they had lodged, and where &s;he had been
talking of her lady's misfortunes, a per&s;on
who was pre&s;ent &s;aid, that if Madame
could embroider wai&s;tcoats, work cra|vats,
or draw land&s;capes, &s;he would un|dertake
to &s;ell them to the mi&s;tre&s;s of the
principal inn at Sur&s;ee, who made it her
bu&s;ine&s;s to di&s;po&s;e of &s;uch little &s;ort of
works, which were executed by &s;ome emi|grant
ladies who lived in that town; and
&s;he was &s;ure the &s;ame benevolent per&s;on
would do as much for Madame, when &s;he
knew her &s;tory.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="332">
Victoire had proceeded thus far, when
Madame C&mdash;threw her&s;elf on her knees,
and poured forth a &s;ervent thank&s;giving: &s;he
then folded her little boy to her bo&s;om, and
in&s;tantly di&s;patched Victoire to make known
how thankfully &s;he accepted this ble&s;&s;ed
offer. Early the next morning the nece&s;&s;ary
materials were purcha&s;ed, and Madame
C&mdash;, with eager alacrity, began her ta&s;k.
While &s;he contemplated the fir&s;t elegant
performance, which advanced rapidly be|neath
her creating hand, tears of &s;oothing
plea&s;ure, tears which it was luxury to &s;hed,
gu&s;hed from her eyes. To have the power
of applying tho&s;e accompli&s;hments, which
&s;he had only cultivated as the amu&s;ement of
a &s;olitary hour, to the dear, the precious
purpo&s;e of &s;u&s;taining her child, filled her
mind with the &s;weete&s;t &s;en&s;ations of mater|nal
tenderne&s;s&mdash;it was delight, elevated by
the noble con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of duty&mdash;it was an
effort of virtue, which, while it &s;hielded
<PB N="314" REF="333">
the object of her fond &s;olicitude from &s;uf|fering,
was interwoven with an immediate
recompen&s;e in the &s;oothing effect it pro|duced
on her own mind. Since, amid&s;t con|tinual
occupation, that gloomy de&s;ondency,
which in &s;tillne&s;s and &s;olitude brooded over
its own turbulent wretchedne&s;s, was &s;oft|ened
into milder &s;orrow, and engro&s;&s;ed by
the uncea&s;ing care of providing for her
child, the image of its father, which u&s;ed to
call forth the wild agonies of di&s;appointed
pa&s;&s;ion, but now awakened a tender melan|choly,
which re&s;ignation tempered. The
only moments which Madame C&mdash;gave
to lei&s;ure, and the indulgence of her feel|ings,
were tho&s;e of twilight, when, after
the unremitting labours of the long &s;um|mer
day, &s;he u&s;ually left her little boy to
the care of Victoire, and walking out alone
amid&s;t tho&s;e &s;cenes of &s;olemn grandeur, in|dulged
that mournful mu&s;ing, when the
mind wanders ever its vani&s;hed plea&s;ures,
<PB N="315" REF="334">
and tears, which flow without controul,
embalm the pa&s;t!</P>
<P>In one of tho&s;e &s;olitary walks, &s;eated on
the fragment of a rock, near the torrent|&s;tream,
the hoar&s;e noi&s;e of who&s;e melan|choly
waters were congenial to her medita|tions,
the chain of pen&s;ive thought was &s;ud|denly
broken by the tread of an approaching
foot&s;tep. She ca&s;t up her eyes, and be|held
Mon&s;. C&mdash;, who, pale, and tremb|ling
with emotion, threw him&s;elf at her feet,
cla&s;ped her knees in unutterable agony, and
at length told her in broken accents, that he
came not to &s;olicit her forgivene&s;s, but to
die in her pre&s;ence&mdash;that feeling he had but
a &s;hort time to live, he had ventured to be|hold
her once more, not to attempt any ex|tenuation
of his guilt, or to declare how
much he abhorred him&s;elf for the pa&s;t, but
merely to explain the appearance of that
<PB N="316" REF="335">
barbarous neglect, in which &s;he had been
left at Bellinzone.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. C&mdash;then, after execrating the
delu&s;ion, by which he had been &s;o fatally
mi&s;led, related, that having taken an excur|&s;ion
into Germany, at the period when her
letter arrived, he had only received it two
months after it was dated. Rouzed as from
an hideous dream, &s;eized with $e pangs
of remor&s;e at his own conduct, and feeling
every &s;entiment of renewed tenderne&s;s awa|kened
in his heart by the image of her
&s;ufferings, he in&s;tantly declared to Madame
&mdash;his re&s;olution to ha&s;ten to Bellinzone.
No intelligence, he perceived, could be
more agreeable to that lady, and not long
after he di&s;covered the rea&s;on, by hearing
that &s;he was gone to Vienna with a Ger|man
Count, the owner of a brilliant equi|page,
with whom &s;he became acquainted
<PB N="317" REF="336">

her to Con&s;tance. Mon&s;. C&mdash;
added, that having him&s;elf &s;et out on foot
from that city, being determined not to
&s;pend on the indulgence of a carriage the
few louis he had yet in re&s;erve, the violent
emotions of his mind, joined to exce&s;&s;ive
fatigue of body, by taking journeys too
rapid, in order to accelerate his arrival, pro|duced
a dangerous fever. At a little vil|lage-inn,
where he lay for &s;everal weeks
&s;tretched upon a &s;olitary bed of &s;ickne&s;s, he
had perhaps, he &s;aid, in &s;ome mea&s;ure
atoned for the pa&s;t, by the bitterne&s;s of his
regrets, by that angui&s;h&mdash;he was proceed|ing,
when Madame C&mdash;threw her&s;elf
upon his neck, bathed his bo&s;om with her
tears, conjured him for ever to forget the
pa&s;t, and declared, that her &s;ufferings had
already vani&s;hed in the hope of his return|ing
affection.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="337">
When Madame C&mdash;, with &s;oft per|&s;ua&s;ion,
had &s;omewhat reconciled her hu&s;|band
to him&s;elf, and a calm confidential
conver&s;ation had &s;ucceeded the tumultuous
emotions of their fir&s;t meeting, they bent
their way to the little apartment which was
now their &s;ole habitation, and which he had
not yet entered; &s;ince having learned from
the people of the hou&s;e, in Victoire's ab|&s;ence,
which path Madame C&mdash;had
taken for her evening walk, he had in&s;tantly
ha&s;tened to the &s;pot. They had &s;carcely
reached the chamber, when his little boy
&s;prung forward to meet him, clung upon
his neck, called him his dear, dear papa,
and reiterated his care&s;&s;es till Mon&s;. C&mdash;,
overcome with faintne&s;s, agitation, and fa|tigue,
&s;unk &s;en&s;ele&s;s on a chair. Madame
C&mdash;wept at ob&s;erving his emaciated
figure, and his pale and haggard look; and
Victoire, &s;he perceived, tried to &s;queeze out
a tear too, but not &s;ucceeding, all &s;he could
<PB N="319" REF="338">
do was to wipe her eyes carefully with her
handkerchief. Victoire was probably think|ing
more of the dry cru&s;ts on which &s;he
had dined occa&s;ionally, and which &s;ort of
repa&s;ts &s;he attributed to her ma&s;ter's con|duct,
than of his &s;ickly countenance. Ma|dame
C&mdash;found nothing more difficult
than to re&s;train Victoire's loquacity, who
contrived, whenever &s;he had an opportu|nity
in the cour&s;e of the evening, to relate
the hard&s;hips they had &s;uffered with a &s;pite|ful
minutene&s;s of detail&mdash;how Madame
breakfa&s;ted upon cold water in&s;tead of cof|fee,
and dined &s;ometimes upon lentil-&s;oup,
and &s;ometimes not at all; and how &s;he
gained two livres a-day by drawing and em|broidery.</P>
<P>This la&s;t intelligence was more than
Mon&s;. C&mdash;could bear; he hid his face
with his hands, &s;prung from his chair, and
walked in a di&s;ordered manner up and
<PB N="320" REF="339">
down the room. Madame angrily impo&s;ed
&s;ilence on Victoire, who, taking the hint,
declared that &s;he was <HI>au de&s;e&s;poir</HI> at having
afflicted Mon&s;ieur, for whom &s;he felt the
mo&s;t profound re&s;pect, and then left the
room, in order, probably, to talk over his
tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions to the whole neighbourhood.
She &s;taid &s;o long, that Madame C&mdash;was
forced to go in &s;earch of her, and as &s;he
approached, heard her &s;aying, &startq;to be &s;ure
I don't forget that Mon&s;ieur is a <HI>cordon
rouge</HI> after all, and therefore not made to
give an account of his actions to any body;
but then when I think of my dear lady&endq;&mdash;
here Victoire was interrupted in her unfi|ni&s;hed
&s;peech.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur had a return of his fever,
which la&s;ted &s;ome weeks; and, at
length, believing he had &s;uffered &s;uffi|cient
penance, Victoire graciou&s;ly ac|corded
him her forgivene&s;s. A &s;hort time
<PB N="321" REF="340">
after, the return of Mon&s;. C&mdash;, a letter
arrived from their friend in France, with
tidings that he had &s;ecured for Madame
C&mdash;a &s;um &s;ufficient to produce a little
revenue, which would place her out of the
reach of want, and which &s;um was depo|&s;ited
in the hands of a Swi&s;s banker. Upon
receiving this intelligence, they determined
to leave their wretched apartment, and hav|ing,
in their rambles along the wild valley
leading to the Gri&s;ons, di&s;covered a neat
vacant cottage, they hired it for the &s;um|mer;

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Vi&s;it to the Gri&s;ons.&mdash;Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion on the Revolution.</HEAD>
<P>IN one of our rides near Bellinzone, we
made an excur&s;ion along a valley belonging
to the Gri&s;ons. Fatigued with the beams of
the noon day &s;un, we looked around for the
inn of the village, and accepted the invita|tion
of a per&s;on, of whom we made the
inquiry, and over who&s;e door we &s;aw an
in&s;cription that denoted the a&s;ylum, of
which we were in &s;earch. The hour of
dinner was pa&s;t in the valley, but a plenti|ful
collation of fruits, wine, and cakes,
were &s;et before us. On our entrance we
found three or four per&s;ons in warm poli|tical
debate; but the principal di&s;putants
were a gentleman of Turin, who had lately
pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time at Paris, and a young ec|cle&s;ia&s;tic
<PB N="324" REF="343">
belonging to an adjoining village.
As the &s;ubject of di&s;pute was the revolution
which had ju&s;t then taken place in the Gri|&s;ons,
we were led to a&s;k for information
re&s;pecting it.</P>
<P>The native of Turin informed us, that
that event was nothing but the tran&s;itory
commotion of an ignorant and tumultuous
mob, that on &s;ome idle pretence had a&s;|&s;embled
together to correct abu&s;es that did
not exi&s;t, had &s;eized on the government of
the country, committed great depredations
on the property of individuals, and were on
the point of being reduced to their primi|tive
nothingne&s;s, as the good &s;en&s;e of the
country revolted again&s;t proceedings &s;o de&s;|tructive
of peace and order. The eccle&s;ia&s;tic
li&s;tened with con&s;iderable impatience to the
end of the harangue, when, with an elo|quent
volubility, that proved how ear|ne&s;tly
his heart was engaged in the cau&s;e,
<PB N="325" REF="344">
he ran over the long li&s;t of tyrannies exer|ci&s;ed
on the people by the Ari&s;tocratic go|vernments,
which had ju&s;t been overthrown.
He atte&s;ted that this tumultuous rabble was
a regular a&s;&s;embly of the repre&s;entatives of
the people deputed from each commune,
and who had met as a legal convention to re|form
in the mo&s;t con&s;titutional manner
tho&s;e abu&s;es. He a&s;&s;ured us, that &s;o far
from committing depredations on property,
perhaps the only blame to be ca&s;t on the
convention, was the lenity with which they
had treated tho&s;e offences, which had ne|ce&s;&s;itated
the change of government, &s;ince
all they had done was to order a repayment
into the public trea&s;ury from each defaulter
of the unaccounted monies; but this was
exacted in &s;uch &s;mall proportions, that the
&s;entence &s;eemed rather an invitation to of|fence
than a puni&s;hment for pa&s;t depreda|tions.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="345">
The reforms in the future admini&s;tration,
he a&s;&s;erted, were not le&s;s mild than the
lenity exerci&s;ed again&s;t the abu&s;es of the
pa&s;t. The people were relieved from the
burden of taxes that were never applied by
their former governors to the &s;ervice of the
&s;tate, and the feudal rights of the nobility
were aboli&s;hed; that with the exception of
the &s;light retributions made to the public
pur&s;e, and the lo&s;s of certain privileges, by
more equality in the regulations of com|merce,
the nobles had nothing to lament,
but a degree of influence, which they ought
never to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and were even per|mitted
to retain all the in&s;ignia of their an|cient
dominion, all the decorations of fa|mily
and title. So far, continued our eccle|&s;ia&s;tic,
was this a&s;&s;embly of the people from
being reduced to what was called primitive
nothingne&s;s, that having only before them
certain &s;imple objects of reform, in which
they were unanimous, they had adjourned
<PB N="327" REF="346">
their meeting, merely becau&s;e they had
fini&s;hed their work; and &s;o far were they
from having acted contrary to the wi&s;h of
their con&s;tituents, that he believed, except
from tho&s;e who were immediately intere&s;t|ed
in the continuance of ancient abu&s;es,
there was but one voice throughout the
whole country, that of enthu&s;ia&s;m for the
recovery of their rights, which, if again at|tacked,
all were ready to defend, or peri&s;h
in the attempt<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It appears that this young eccle&s;ia&s;tic had formed too favourable an opinion of his new governors on the other &s;ide of the mountain; and it is probable, that he and the other inhabitants of the Valley of Mi&s;ox have &s;ince changed their manner of thinking: &s;ince it is &s;aid, that the people of this valley, now the only part of the Gri&s;on dominions on the &s;outhern &s;ide of the Alps, have &s;olicited their junction to the Ci&s;alpine re|public; between which two countries are &s;ituated the Italian bailiwicks.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The reply of the Piedmonte&s;e to his an|tagoni&s;t
<PB N="328" REF="347">
was witty and &s;arca&s;tic; but it was
ea&s;y to perceive, by the triumph painted in
the countenances of the by-&s;tanders, that
the prie&s;t had echoed their own &s;entiments.
Our inn-keeper joined in the conver&s;ation,
with an authority equal to his gue&s;ts; but
though deeply intere&s;ted in the debate, was
careful to go at certain intervals with a
&s;poonful of lemonade to wet the parched
lips of a feveri&s;h infant, who lay in its
cradle in a corner of the room. Its &s;i&s;ter, a
girl of &s;ix years of age, dre&s;t in a blue bod|dice,
and &s;hort red petticoat, with her feet
and legs bare, and who&s;e cheek flu&s;hed with
the cleare&s;t bloom of health, and eye &s;park|ing
with &s;prightline&s;s, formed a &s;triking
contra&s;t to the languid look of the pale
baby, &s;tood patiently at the &s;ide of its
cradle, with a large vine-branch in her
hand, which &s;he waved backwards and for|wards
to prevent the numerous flies, that
noon brings forth in that country, from
<PB N="329" REF="348">
teizing the &s;ick child. There was &s;ome|thing
&s;o attractive in this dome&s;tic groupe,
that they often made me forget the Gri&s;on
revolution.</P>
<P>Two hours had glided away before we
thought of ordering our hor&s;es, when we
received a mo&s;t cordial invitation from a
venerable old man of the party, to pa&s;s a
few days at his dwelling, in our pa&s;&s;age
over his mountains, having heard that we
propo&s;ed returning through the Gri&s;on
country.</P>
<P>We were not a little embarra&s;&s;ed at the
mi&s;take we had made, when upon inquir|ing
what expence we had incurred, our
ho&s;t replied, that the only recompen&s;e he
de&s;ired was our &s;peedy return at an earlier
hour to dinner: when we &s;hould be re|ceived,
not as he &s;aw we &s;uppo&s;ed our|&s;elves
at an inn, but at the habitation of
<PB N="330" REF="349">
a friend, who would be thankful for the
favour. Our inn-keeper proved, on in|quiry,
to be the principal magi&s;trate of the
di&s;trict, and the in&s;cription, which we had
taken for a &s;ign, was an ornament over the
door of his hou&s;e.</P>

<P>WE did not fail, on leaving the Italian
vallies, to pa&s;s two days with our ho&s;pita|ble
ho&s;t, the greater part of which were
&s;pent in excur&s;ions among&s;t the mountains,
particularly tho&s;e of the Val Calenca, which
is one of the four di&s;tricts of this juri&s;dic|tion,
called the high juri&s;diction of the
Valley of Mi&s;ox. A rapid torrent flowing
from the Glaciers of the Bird Mountain,
runs noi&s;ily through the Valley of Valenca,
and throws it&s;elf into the Moe&s;a. We pa&s;|&s;ed
through &s;everal villages, but &s;topped to
repo&s;e our&s;elves at Santa Maria, the capital
of the Valley, where we &s;aw a magnificent
<PB N="332" REF="351">
church dedicated to the Virgin. The la&s;t
village in this di&s;trict, or the neare&s;t to the
Glaciers, is Val Bella, or the Beautiful Val|ley;
but as we were a&s;&s;ured that the place
did not at all corre&s;pond with the name, we
di&s;continued our journey thither. This
valley, &s;ituated between the mountains of
Val Bienna and tho&s;e of the Valley of Mi|&s;ox,
is exten&s;ive, but for the mo&s;t part wild
and barren; it is not ea&s;y to find a place in
the world &s;o little known to it, as this &s;e|cluded
and &s;avage nook. The ungrateful
&s;oil prompts the inhabitants to periodical
emigrations; the &s;ummer is &s;pent in the
native hut, and the winter is the &s;ea&s;on of
travel and ob&s;ervation, the expences of
which are defrayed by the produce of their
manufactures, &s;uch as ba&s;kets, pitch, grind|ing-&s;tones,
and other territorial mountain|ous
productions, which they fell in Italy.
Tho&s;e who are not engaged in commercial
projects, and the wives and children of
<PB N="333" REF="352">
tho&s;e who are, follow other &s;peculations of
profit, among which are tho&s;e of begging
and predicting the <HI>buona aventura,</HI> or tel|ting
fortunes.</P>
<P>After taking leave of our kind ho&s;t, we
proceeded on our journey along the Valley
of Mi&s;ox towards the Bernardin moun|tains.
This valley is one of the four high
juri&s;dictions below the woods, into which
the Gri&s;on league is divided. The ancient
inhabitants are known in hi&s;tory under the
general term of the Lepontii, but their de|&s;cendants
were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively &s;ubject to the
Bi&s;hop of Como, the Counts of Saxe, and
the family of the Trivulci. In the middle
of the &s;ixteenth century, the inhabitants
purcha&s;ed their freedom of this family for
twenty-five thou&s;and florins, and joined
them&s;elves to the Gri&s;on league, who have
maintained the confederacy, notwith&s;tanding
the various attempts which have been
<PB N="334" REF="353">
&s;ince made to deprive them of their li|berty.</P>
<P>The road, for &s;everal miles, is perfectly
level along the Moe&s;a, and the valley &s;uffi|ciently
exten&s;ive to admit of fine cultiva|tion,
contains a number of hand&s;ome vil|lages;
but after pa&s;&s;ing the confluence of
this &s;tream with the torrent of Calenca, the
valley becomes &s;o narrow as to admit little
more &s;pace between the mountains than for
the path and the river. Here we were once
more among rocks, torrents, and cliffs load|ed
with woods, pre&s;enting not only parts of
the mountain &s;cenery, to which we were
now accu&s;tomed, but from the great depth of
the valley clo&s;ed in by &s;urrounding moun|tains,
ca&s;ting a kind of gloomy light over the
wild land&s;cape, that &s;trongly excited in the
mind that &s;en&s;ation of melancholy which
Pope has characteri&s;ed,
<Q>&startq;Breathing a browner horror o'er the woods.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="354">
Before we came to the end of this lower
valley, where the mountain, direct in front,
lofty and abrupt, &s;eemed to preclude all
po&s;&s;ibility of proceeding, we pa&s;&s;ed for a
con&s;iderable way over a road entirely broken
up, and which di&s;played the roots of
larches, pines, and other mountain trees,
mingled with va&s;t mounds of gravelly
&s;tones and ma&s;&s;es of rock. This de&s;olation
had been cau&s;ed by a deluge from the up|per
mountains, on the &s;udden melting of
the &s;nows in the &s;pring from an ince&s;&s;ant
rain, which la&s;ted &s;everal days, accompa|nied
by gu&s;ts of warm winds, like the Si|rocco
of Italy. The openings into the
ravines of the mountains where the &s;now
had drifted, and from its ma&s;s had re&s;i&s;ted
the influence of the heat which melted the
thinner layers, &s;erved as &s;luice-gates to the
&s;ea of waters which they ingulphed. The
increa&s;ing weight of tho&s;e waters from the
melting of the &s;nows above, together with
<PB N="336" REF="355">
the decrea&s;e in the re&s;i&s;ting ma&s;s beneath,
from the heat and the rain, prepared at
length the cata&s;trophe, by the giving way
of the icy barrier.</P>
<P>Language can but feebly paint the &s;ub|lime
and terrific effects of this deluge of the
mountainous &s;ea. Had our poet, Thom&s;on,
beheld this mighty deva&s;tation, his glowing
imagination would have pre&s;ented us with
far other images than tho&s;e of
<Q><L>&startq;Herds and flocks, and travellers and &s;wains,</L>
<L>And &s;ometimes whole brigades of marching troops,</L>
<L>Or hamlets &s;leeping in the dread of night;&endq;</L></Q>
the feeble works of human art and indu&s;try
hurled beneath the &s;mothering ruins. He
would have viewed the lofty pine, the an|cient
inhabitant of the Alps, who&s;e roots
have been riveted for ages to the &s;oil, &s;wept
away, by the horrible flood, like the chaff;
the rocks, coeval with time, and which
<PB N="337" REF="356">
&s;eemed fixed on the &s;olid globe till time
&s;hall be no longer, torn from their ba&s;e
with irre&s;i&s;tible fury, and rolled, in one wild
convul&s;ive commotion, down the tremend|ous
precipices, riving up the affrighted &s;oil,
in their de&s;cent, and covering the fertile
pa&s;turage and rich champain with irrepara|ble
de&s;olation.</P>
<P>A narrow pa&s;s cut out of a fanta&s;tic
rock, hanging over the Moe&s;a, which forms
a bay in the plain, brought us to the foot
of this perpendicular mountain, down
who&s;e dark wooded and &s;haggy precipices
we heard the torrent roaring, but which
their projecting &s;ides concealed from our
view. We appeared to be inclo&s;ed between
inacce&s;&s;ible heights; there was no pa&s;&s;age
di&s;coverable like that of the cavern which
leads from the devil's bridge into the Valley
of Ur&s;eren, and it would have exerci&s;ed the
imagination, to have built even an ideal road
<PB N="338" REF="357">
by which the a&s;cent could be gained. The
mountaineers, however, had overcome the
difficulty; on that &s;ide of the mountain
which was the mo&s;t &s;loping, or rather the
lea&s;t perpendicular, a road was cut in tra|ver&s;e
directions to the end of the &s;lope,
whence it was returned in an angle, &s;uffi|ciently
broad to permit the a&s;cent of cattle,
and &s;o continued from one &s;ide to the other
&s;upported by beams of wood, either for the
pre&s;ervation of the way, or to keep the tra|veller
from &s;tumbling over the precipice,
till after laborious climbing it brings him
to the &s;ummit.</P>
<P>Like the pa&s;&s;age into the Valley of Ur|&s;eren,
the plain on the top of this moun|tain
pre&s;ented us with &s;cenes altogether dif|ferent
from tho&s;e which we had left beneath.
It is generally in the lower valleys, which
&s;erve as canals or outlets to the mountains,
that we find tho&s;e romantic and picture&s;que
<PB N="339" REF="358">
objects, on which we gaze with delight
and a&s;toni&s;hment. In the upper moun|tains,
nature has ca&s;t off the fanta&s;tic and
varied garb of rock, and cliff, and torrent,
for a robe more &s;imple and maje&s;tic; the
&s;cene takes a larger &s;weep, the fore&s;t is
more exten&s;ive, and the hills &s;well with a
more noble grace one above the other.</P>
<P>So few are the travellers who pa&s;s this
mountain, the principal pa&s;&s;ages acro&s;s the
Alps being tho&s;e of St. Gothard and Splugen,
that the vi&s;it of &s;trangers is an event of
&s;ome importance. On our approach to a
village embo&s;omed in trees, forming the
middle point of an amphitheatre of a beau|tiful
range of hills, covered with the fre&s;he&s;t
verdure, we di&s;covered our venerable friend
walking ha&s;tily towards us, with a pretty
little mountain nymph, his grand-daughter,
in one hand, and a large oaken &s;taff in the
other, which he &s;hook at us with a &s;mile
<PB N="340" REF="359">
of reproach, declaring that he had waited
dinner three hours beyond his u&s;ual time,
having had news of us early in the morn|ing,
and that he could not imagine why
we had loitered &s;o long on the way. We
found a plentiful repa&s;t prepared for us,
con&s;i&s;ting of bea&s;ts and birds of the fore&s;t,
and were informed that we &s;hould not be
&s;uffered to depart till the provi&s;ion was ex|pended,
which the hunting of the two pre|ceding
days had furni&s;hed.</P>
<P>The old man's family con&s;i&s;ted of a
daughter and her two children, the one a
youth of twenty, and the other the pretty
little mountaineer of &s;ixteen years of age,
who had come with her grandfather to meet
us; his &s;on-in-law, who was then gone on
&s;ome affairs to Chiavenna, was expected
home before our departure. We &s;pent the
remainder of the day in walking among
the&s;e romantic and pa&s;toral &s;cenes, and the
<PB N="341" REF="360">
next we made a family party up the moun|tain,
to dine in one of his &s;hepherd's huts&punc;
by the &s;ide of a fine ca&s;cade, which, having
found out my enthu&s;ia&s;m for &s;uch objects,
he told me he was &s;ure I &s;hould find worth
the toil of the vi&s;it. The torrent formed
part of a beautiful land&s;cape, and played in
&s;ucce&s;&s;ive cataracts over rocks that were
picture&s;que; but we had &s;een too much of
the Reu&s;s and the Te&s;&s;ino, to find in the&s;e
falling waters any new charm, except that
they were inclo&s;ed by green banks in&s;tead
of &s;haggy rocks.</P>
<P>The&s;e hills appeared, from their verdure,
to be in the highe&s;t &s;tate of mountainous
cultivation. The &s;pot was not &s;o elevated as
to be out of the reach of the parching &s;un|beam,
and little channels cut along the &s;ide
of the &s;lopes, drew the water away from the
idle torrent to fertilize the adjoining pa&s;|tures.
On the greater part of the&s;e hills
<PB N="342" REF="361">
the hay had already been cut. Some yet
lay on the ground, which, from the moun|tain
flowers and herbs, &s;cented the air with
the mo&s;t delicious fragrance. While the&s;e
hills are laid up for harve&s;t, the &s;hepherd
removes to the Upper Alps, a&s;cending with
his cattle to crop the herbage of tho&s;e
higher hills, as they are &s;ucce&s;&s;ively de|prived
of their &s;nows. Here he &s;pends
a &s;olitary and cheerle&s;s life through the
&s;hort &s;ummer, and returns in the autumn
to the huts in the lower vallies, where
he remains &s;hut up with his cattle to con|&s;ume
the provi&s;ion which he has prepared
for winter. The life of the &s;hepherd of the
Alps is very different from that of the &s;hep|herd
of Arcadia; but from the little inter|cour&s;e
which he holds with any &s;ociety
whatever, except the bea&s;ts which he feeds,
his wants are only tho&s;e of nature, and con|&s;equently
few: the intemperance of the
&s;ea&s;on finds him prepared to meet it without
<PB N="343" REF="362">
&s;hrinking, and the winter &s;torm flies harm|le&s;s
over his head, who&s;e phy&s;ical feelings
are hardened to the icy temperature of his
mountains, and who is accu&s;tomed to
<Q>&startq;Brea&s;t the keen air, and carol as he goes.&endq;</Q>
Sometimes indeed the patience of the &s;hep|herd
expires before the winter, when he
perceives, which &s;ometimes happens, that
his &s;tock decays fa&s;ter than the &s;ummer
approaches.</P>
<P>The&s;e pa&s;turages are not &s;ufficiently &s;teep
for avalanches, but higher up the moun|tain,
partial mi&s;chiefs are occa&s;ioned by
their de&s;cent; and &s;ometimes &s;hepherds,
huts, and cattle, are lo&s;t for a while under
immen&s;e drifts of &s;now, which the impetu|ous
winds have &s;ent in that direction. It
was difficult for us, the inhabitants of the
lower world, to conceive that the change of
<PB N="344" REF="363">
&s;ea&s;ons could make &s;o barren and cheerle&s;s
a de&s;art of &s;o beautiful and fertile a country,
as that which we beheld, &s;eated at our rural
repa&s;t before the &s;hepherd's door; around
which the cattle were browzing, or lay
ba&s;king in the noon-tide &s;un-beam. That
the &s;ummer might be pa&s;&s;ed agreeably
amid&s;t the&s;e mountains, we could ea&s;ily be|lieve;
for &s;urely there are few &s;pots on the
globe, that can boa&s;t a more boundle&s;s &s;tore
<Q><L>&startq;Of charms, which nature to her vot'ry yields;</L>
<L>The warbling woodland, and the torrent's roar,</L>
<L>The pomp of groves, and garniture of fields;</L>
<L>All that the genial ray of morning gilds,</L>
<L>And all that echoes to the &s;ong of even;</L>
<L>All that the mountain's &s;helt'ring bo&s;om &s;hields,</L>
<L>And all the dread magnificence of heaven;&endq;</L></Q>
But the winter mu&s;t indeed be gloomily
de&s;olate to tho&s;e, who, above the cla&s;s of
the pea&s;ant, and having no ta&s;te for litera|ture,
are immured in the&s;e in&s;ulated regions,
<PB N="345" REF="364">
which at that &s;ea&s;on become altogether im|pa&s;&s;able.</P>
<P>My pretty little companion an&s;wered my
que&s;tions, re&s;pecting her winter occupa|tions,
by telling me, that &s;he had returned
from &s;chool at Bellinzone the &s;ummer be|fore,
and had employed the la&s;t winter in
&s;pinning and making her grandfather a
large quantity of &s;hirts, had worked a
flowered gown for her&s;elf, and read half of
an abridgment of Guicciardini's Hi&s;tory of
the Wars of Italy, and two or three
volumes of Goldoni's Plays.</P>
<P>We bade adieu, with reluctance, to our
patriarchal ho&s;t: I could have loitered
with plea&s;ure yet a little longer in his
ho&s;pitable dwelling. How &s;oothing was
this &s;cene of tranquil plea&s;ure&mdash;how de|lightful
a tran&s;ition from the crimes of
ferocious tyranny were the pa&s;toral occupa|tions
<PB N="346" REF="365">
and guiltle&s;s manners of tho&s;e Alpine
regions! At a village, a few miles further
up the mountain, where the whole family
conducted us, we pa&s;&s;ed one more &s;ocial
hour at breakfa&s;t, and then finally taking
leave of them, impre&s;&s;ed with the mo&s;t
agreeable recollection of their &s;imple kind|ne&s;s,
we began to climb the &s;tupendous
&s;ummits of their mountains, the haunts of
eternal winter.</P>

<P>THE Alps, which we traver&s;ed in our
a&s;cent, wear, with little variation, the &s;ame
&s;miling a&s;pect as in the regions below.
When the mountaineers &s;peak of the Alps,
they do not mean tho&s;e long chains of icy
or barren mountains, to which we give that
appellation, and which, in our language,
implies height. In the mountain dialect
that term conveys the idea of fertility; and
when the inhabitants talk of the Alps,
they always mean &s;pots of mountain pa&s;tur|age.
The <HI>Glet&s;cher,</HI> the <HI>Horn,</HI> the <HI>Stork,</HI>
are denominations, by which they di&s;tin|gui&s;h
different parts of the&s;e mountains,
<PB N="348" REF="367">
and the terms of rocky or ice-covered Alps,
would to them be unintelligible.</P>
<P>Having climbed to the village of St. Ber|nardin,
and finding our&s;elves within the
influence of the Glaciers, which we &s;aw
&s;tretching far before us, we concluded, that
we had nearly reached the &s;ummit, but
learnt that we had yet a league of very
rough a&s;cent to pa&s;s over before we &s;hould
begin to de&s;cend on the other &s;ide. We
made a halt at the village of St. Bernardin,
if two or three hou&s;es, one of which is an
inn, and a little building, dignified by the
name of a chapel, can be called a village.
The country around wears a cheerle&s;s, &s;oli|tary
a&s;pect. We were not got beyond the
reach of vegetation; but it was a vegetation
that made the barrenne&s;s of the &s;oil more
vi&s;ible. The inhabitant of the Lower Alps
&s;hares no property in this &s;terile region:
the wandering &s;hepherd of the plains alone
<PB N="349" REF="368">
&s;teals the winged days of &s;ummer, to lead
over an unappropriated &s;oil his ragged and
ill-favoured flock. His mi&s;erable hut is
compo&s;ed of pieces of rock, through the cran|nies
of which the wind and the rain pour
without re&s;i&s;tance. His chief and almo&s;t
unvaried food is oatmeal and water; for
the &s;oil would reward no cultivation: bread
is the produce only of climates far below;
he is bereaved even of the mo&s;t common
enjoyments of &s;ocial life.</P>
<P>In the&s;e regions, however, we found
one inhabitant of poli&s;hed manners, and let|tered
accompli&s;hments. A bani&s;hed vicar
general of one of the principal dioce&s;es of
France was dragging on exi&s;tence amid&s;t
the&s;e inho&s;pitable climes, barred from all
communication with the world during the
long winter, and &s;upported by the mi&s;erable
endowment of the chapel, amounting to &s;ix
or &s;even louis a year, and the coar&s;e charity
<PB N="350" REF="369">
of the rude mountaineers, who were his
&s;ole a&s;&s;ociates. He told us, that his bre|viary,
his bible, and his Ovid, were his
only &s;olace; that from the one he endea|voured
to teach him&s;elf re&s;ignation to the
will of heaven, and from the other to &s;ooth
his mind, by &s;ympathizing with an exiled
fellow &s;ufferer, who, bani&s;hed from the
delights of a court to the de&s;arts of Scy|thia,
could &s;carcely have found them more
dreary than the &s;ummit of St. Bernardin.
Here al&s;o he might have exclaimed with
the poet:
<Q><L>&startq;Forced from my native &s;eats, and &s;acred home,</L>
<L>Friendle&s;s, alone, through Scythian wilds to roam;</L>
<L>With trembling knees o'er unknown hills I go,</L>
<L>Stiff with blue ice and heap'd with drifted &s;now;</L>
<L>Pale &s;uns there &s;trike their feeble rays in vain,</L>
<L>Which faintly glance again&s;t the marble plain.&endq;</L>
<BIBL>Mrs. BARBAULD.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="370">
He had been vaguely informed of the fall
of Robe&s;pierre, and the return of a milder
&s;y&s;tem; and he inquired with &s;uch &s;olici|tude
if there was no hope of his being
permitted to revi&s;it his country, that it
would have been cruel to rob his &s;orrows
of that fond illu&s;ion. We left this unfor|tunate
&s;tranger with &s;incere regret, that we
had no power to extricate him from a &s;itua|tion
which &s;eemed almo&s;t in&s;upportable.</P>
<P>We now began to &s;cale the remainder of
the mountain, and though we felt the icy
breeze from the neighbouring Glaciers, we
e&s;caped any di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ations of cold
by the frequent exerci&s;e of walking, the
road being often too &s;teep or too dangerous
to continue or hor&s;eback. We al&s;o enjoyed
the rays of a cloudle&s;s &s;un, more brilliant,
indeed, than genial, from the extreme rare|faction
of the atmo&s;phere at this elevation.
We had been told at Bellinzone that the
<PB N="352" REF="371">
mountain, for two leagues, is always co|vered
with a con&s;iderable quantity of &s;now,
but without having pa&s;&s;ed any, we attained
the &s;ummit.</P>
<P>The top of St. Bernardin affords nothing
that is &s;triking, except its de&s;olate unifor|mity;
here are no ma&s;&s;es of enormous rock,
no tremendous precipices, no yawning
cha&s;ms; no object picture&s;que or awe|ful.
The &s;torms of ages have not only
&s;tript it of the means of vegetation, by
wa&s;hing away every ve&s;tige of &s;oil, but
have humbled the rocks, if any once &s;tood
prominent, to a mode&s;t level with the wa&s;te.
The mountain &s;till ri&s;ing on the right, con|ceals
the Glaciers that &s;eparate the Gri&s;ons
from the Valt$line, but on the left the eye
wanders far over tho&s;e regions of eternal
fro&s;t, which are formed by the ea&s;tern ex|tremity
of that chain of mountains, known
to the antients under the name of the Adula.
<PB N="353" REF="372">
In the front the view extends acro&s;s the
valley of the Rhine, to the Glaciers that
&s;eparate it from the other vallies of the
Gri&s;ons. We &s;eemed within reach of tho&s;e
Glaciers which we beheld falling, like an
immen&s;e veil, down the mountain below
our pre&s;ent elevation, and were eager to
tread their glo&s;&s;y &s;urface; but were told
that a pa&s;&s;age acro&s;s from St. Bernardin was
impracticable.</P>
<P>After repo&s;ing our&s;elves on the &s;ummit,
amid&s;t this chaos of unvivified nature, we
began to de&s;cend on the northern &s;ide. The
mountains we had ju&s;t &s;caled were &s;o
abruptly thrown back, that we could di&s;|cern
no farther in a direct line before us,
than the hill which we were immediately
a&s;cending, and often believed we had at|tained
the &s;ummit before we had conquered
half the road. On the other &s;ide we were
pre&s;ented with a maje&s;tic &s;weep down the
<PB N="354" REF="373">
mountain, and along the lofty hills that in|clo&s;e
the valley of the Rhine, &s;tretching
away to the piny fore&s;ts ri&s;ing above the
Vale of Splugen. After de&s;cending a con|&s;iderable
way almo&s;t perpendicularly, but
on a firm and well-con&s;tructed road, we
came in view of that celebrated river which
we had lately beheld bearing its thundering
ma&s;s of waters to the ocean, but which,
now ju&s;t &s;pringing from its &s;ource, &s;teals
placidly along the quiet valley, &s;oft as the
fir&s;t &s;leep of infancy after it has waked to
new exi&s;tence.</P>
