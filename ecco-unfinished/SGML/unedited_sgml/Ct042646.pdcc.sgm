<HEAD>To the REVEREND D^R. DELAUNE, PRESIDENT OF St. JOHN'S College in OXFORD.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Shall not, in this Addre&s;s to you, act incon&s;i&s;tently with my profe&s;&s;ed mean opinion of our modern Dedicators and Dedications, &s;ince I de&s;ign to avoid in my &s;elf whatever gives me offence in them, I expect no <HI>Guineas,</HI> and there|fore
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
I hope you will be &s;o good as to expect no <HI>Compliments.</HI></P>
<P>What wholly prevail'd upon me to clap your venerable Name to the&s;e mi&s;|cellaneous <HI>Ba&s;tards</HI> of my brain, was this; I have had for <HI>nine</HI> or <HI>ten</HI> months many things to &s;ay unto you; and I was willing to let the world know what they were, as well as your &s;elf.</P>
<P>Lo! therefore, at your feet, Reve|rend Sir, I throw the following Col|lection of my Lucubrations, which were written (mo&s;t of 'em) within your learned Walls, and under your mo&s;t au&s;picious Government: you will find it compos'd of Poems, &s;acred and pro|phane, original, paraphra&s;ed, imita|ted, and tran&s;lated; Tales, Epigrams, Epi&s;tles, Love-ver&s;es, Elegies upon departed Friends, and Satires upon li|ving Enemies; it begins with the <HI>Cre|ation of the World,</HI> and ends with the di&s;covery of that ingenious uten&s;il, a <HI>Bottle-&s;crue.</HI></P>
<P>I humbly make it my reque&s;t that I may be read with the &s;ame candour that
<PB N="v" REF="4">
my co-temporary Authors at OXFORD have been; and that my rhimes may be equally admir'd with others that are equally dull: and I do particularly for|bid your <HI>Profe&s;&s;or</HI> in this Faculty to cri|ticize on my Works, before he has done the &s;ame ju&s;tice to his own.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e I know that he cannot forbear carping and cavilling; I de&s;ign to be even with him, and propo&s;e to e&s;tabli&s;h a very bulky Reputation upon the ruins of his: For this purpo&s;e I &s;hall &s;hortly put to the Pre&s;s &s;ome in|comparable Performances, which I have by me, of that orthodox Poet; particularly an excellent new Garland, intitled, <HI>The Hanover Turnip;</HI> a copy of Ver&s;es upon the <HI>Chevalier's Picture,</HI> and another upon the death of the <HI>young Prince,</HI> in which he proves the <HI>exit</HI> of that <HI>Whiggi&s;h</HI> young Rogue to be the greate&s;t Ble&s;&s;ing the Nation ever re|ceived; but he will be ea&s;ily forgiven this little Peccadillo by <HI>tho&s;e per&s;ons</HI> who ought to re&s;ent it, having lately experienced their good nature in a
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
much greater in&s;tance. How happy are &s;ome men, who&s;e Enemies prove their Friends! and how unhappy are o|thers, who&s;e Friends prove their Ene|mies!</P>
<P>If any per&s;on in the Univer&s;ity has any Pieces by him, that compliment the <HI>Church,</HI> or vilify the <HI>Revolution,</HI> let him direct 'em to me in my Garret at Mr. <HI>Francklin</HI>'s (not <HI>Curll</HI>'s, as &s;ome per&s;ons have &s;uppos'd) in <HI>Fleet&s;treet,</HI> and they &s;hall be faithfully in&s;erted.</P>
<P>To return to my own Labours. You will find &s;ome of 'em that make a little free with your &s;acred Order; but as every candid reader will &s;uppo&s;e that I aim at <HI>bad</HI> Clergymen only, I am &s;ure they cannot give <HI>you</HI> the lea&s;t un|ea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>This is all I &s;hall &s;ay of the follow|ing Collection; I will therefore now throw a&s;ide the Poet, and &s;peak to you in the character of an unhappy young Fellow, who has, by his erroneous Principles, fallen under your heavy Di&s;plea&s;ure, and has been <HI>expell'd</HI> from
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
your <HI>Affections,</HI> as well as your <HI>Col|lege.</HI></P>
<P>Don't think, dear Sir, that I am going to charge you with any inju&s;tice, or even unkindne&s;s to me: no; on the contrary, I have receiv'd abundance of favours from your hands, and I am re|&s;olv'd to acknowledge them.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place; if ten thou&s;and kind promi&s;es to &s;erve me to the utmo&s;t of your power; if repeated declarations of your Concern for my Welfare and Pro&s;perity, are any Obligations, how infinitely am I oblig'd to you? I don't indeed &s;ay that you ever perform'd any of tho&s;e numerous Promi&s;es, or that in any one in&s;tance you ever &s;hew'd that Concern you profe&s;s'd for me; but I dare not blame you for that; it would be wounding the whole body of <HI>great Men</HI> at once thro' your &s;ides.</P>
<P>Secondly; It was under your wi&s;e Admini&s;tration, that I fir&s;t arriv'd at any Knowledge in the world: I came to your College a raw, ignorant &s;chool|boy, and fooli&s;hly thought Mankind
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
in earne&s;t in what they profe&s;&s;ed; I took Liberty for a <HI>real</HI> Ble&s;&s;ing, and Religion for the <HI>real</HI> Wor&s;hip of God; I often remember how &s;crupulous I was in the mo&s;t <HI>common</HI> concerns of Life; with what awful dread I took an Oath, and with what tremendous veneration I receiv'd the Sacrament: but how much I am improved for the <HI>better</HI> &s;ince, let my <HI>wor&s;t</HI> Enemies bear witne&s;s.</P>
<P>I ra&s;hly judg'd of Religion by the Works it produc'd, and of its Pro|fe&s;&s;ors by the &s;anctity of their Behavi|our; but I am now convinc'd of a great Truth, namely, that Faith and a good Life are utterly independent of each other, and that a Tree may bring forth <HI>bad</HI> Fruit, without fear of being <HI>hewn down and ca&s;t into the Fire.</HI></P>
<P>It is likewi&s;e, under your excellent Admini&s;tration, that I made my &s;elf Ma&s;ter of a pipe of Tobacco, a Bottle, and a Syllogi&s;m: I got acquainted with abundance of <HI>crabbed</HI> Names and <HI>me|taphy&s;ical</HI> Gentlemen, who formerly gave me terrible apprehen&s;ions; but
<PB N="ix" REF="8">
after a little conver&s;ation with them, I found them to be very civil, harm|le&s;s Fellows, and &s;o far from having any <HI>bad</HI> meaning, that they had really <HI>no</HI> meaning at all: indeed they have been made the tools of very wicked Men, and for very wicked purpo&s;es; but &s;o have many <HI>non-meaning</HI> Blockheads as well as they.</P>
<P>To you, Sir, and to the <HI>learned old Woman, my Mother,</HI> I am al&s;o indebt|ed for the title and privileges of a <HI>Gen|tleman:</HI> when I came to the Univer&s;i|ty, I thought my &s;elf a vile <HI>Plebeian;</HI> but I am told that a liberal Education intitles me to a liberal Character, and accordingly I have now clapt on a <HI>Sword,</HI> a <HI>Tye-Wig,</HI> and a <HI>laced Hat,</HI> and keep company with the be&s;t Gentlemen in the County &mdash; Indeed I am my &s;elf, by <HI>Birth,</HI> a &s;ort of a Gentleman, for my Father was a Country <HI>Grazier,</HI> and my Grandfather, a Country <HI>Par&s;on,</HI> which is (you will &s;ay) no mean Extrac|tion; but <HI>vix ea no&s;tra voco,</HI> and methinks I would &s;et up, on a &s;tock of my own.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="9">Nor ought I to forget the good ad|vice and many kind warnings you were plea&s;ed to give me: You fairly told me beforehand, that I did not take the right way to a Fellow&s;hip in YOUR College; that, if I expected any friends there, I mu&s;t not follow my own wild opinions, nor my own hair-brain'd judgment: You told me that I had the character of a <HI>turbulent, ob&s;tinate, ma|licious, ill-natur'd</HI> Fellow; and (what is &s;till wor&s;e than all, &s;aid you) that I was inclin'd to <HI>Infidelity:</HI> upon which I &s;aid within my &s;elf, <HI>How good and joyful a thing it is for</HI> Brethren <HI>to dwell together in Unity?</HI></P>
<P>Happy had it been for me, if I had followed your advice! but in&s;tead of that, like a fool, I got a cock-hor&s;e upon Rea&s;on, and gallop'd away in romantick &s;earch of a fair Lady, called <HI>Truth,</HI> whom after many tedious jour|nies, and ob&s;tinate encounters by the way, I found at la&s;t in a large Ca&s;tle, guarded by a numerous Regiment of <HI>black</HI> Giants, who told me that &s;he was
<PB N="xi" REF="10">
their Pri&s;oner, and that it was in vain for me to attempt her re&s;cue. They told me farther, that they and their predece&s;&s;ors had kept her there for <HI>a|bove a thou&s;and years,</HI> and had levied upon Mankind immen&s;e &s;ums of Money for maintaining them in religious ig|norance; which they con&s;tantly paid with great <HI>thankfulne&s;s</HI> and <HI>humility.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e and &s;everal other &s;uch like favours have I received from <HI>You</HI> and my <HI>academical</HI> Step-mother: there are al&s;o &s;everal other things which Fle&s;h and Blood a&s;&s;ured me were very bad u&s;age; but I comforted my &s;elf under them with the thought of what a mer|ry Friend of mine &s;ays, that it is <HI>for the good of our</HI> Souls, <HI>that you u&s;e our</HI> Bodies <HI>&s;o ill:</HI> I am glad that the Par|&s;ons in this one in&s;tance come &s;o near the Almighty, whom they are hir'd to imitate, and <HI>cha&s;ten whom they love;</HI> &s;ure they mu&s;t love me dearly well! I rejoice in their kind &s;everities; for let them but &s;uffer me to make the be&s;t of
<PB N="xii" REF="11">
the <HI>next world,</HI> I care not how mi&s;era|ble they make me in <HI>this.</HI></P>
<P>You will pardon me, good Sir, if I think it nece&s;&s;ary for your Honour to mention the many heinous crimes for which I was brought to &s;hame. None were indeed publickly alledged again&s;t me at that time, becau&s;e it might as well be done afterwards; &s;ure <HI>old Eng|li&s;hmen</HI> can never forget, that there is &s;uch a thing in the world as hanging a Man fir&s;t, and trying him afterwards: &s;o far'd it with me; my Pro&s;ecutors fir&s;t proved me, by an undeniable Ar|gument, to be no Fellow of St. JOHN'S College, and then to be&mdash;the Lord knows what.</P>
<P>My Indictment, as it is collected out of the faithful Annals of common Fame, runs thus.</P>
<P><HI>Advices from</HI> OXFORD <HI>&s;ay, that on the</HI> 29th <HI>of</HI> June, 1719, <HI>one</HI> NICHOLAS AMHURST <HI>of St.</HI> JOHN <HI>'S College was ex|pell'd for the following Rea&s;ons:</HI></P>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="12"><HI>Imprimis,</HI> For loving <HI>foreign</HI> Turnips and <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Bi&s;hops.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> For believing that <HI>Steeples</HI> and <HI>Organs</HI> are not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> For Ingratitude to his Bene|factor, that &s;potle&s;s Martyr, St. WIL|LIAM LAUD.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> for <HI>Preaching</HI> without Orders, and <HI>Praying</HI> without a Commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> For lampooning <HI>Prie&s;tcraft</HI> and <HI>Petticoatcraft.</HI></P>
<Q>Quam ben&egrave; conveniunt &amp; in <HI>un&acirc; &s;ede</HI> morantur?</Q>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> For <HI>not</HI> lampooning the <HI>Go|vernment</HI> and the <HI>Revolution.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> For prying into <HI>&s;ecret Hi&s;tory.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> To prevent the &s;ame.</P>
<P>My natural Mode&s;ty will not permit me, like other Apologi&s;ts, to vindi|cate my &s;elf in any one particular; the whole Charge is &s;o artfully drawn up, that no rea&s;onable per&s;on would think
<PB N="xiv" REF="13">
ever the <HI>better</HI> of me, &s;hould I ju&s;tify my &s;elf till Doom&s;day.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash; Pudet haec opprobria nobis</L>
<L>Et dici potui&s;&s;e, &amp; non potui&s;&s;e refelli.</L></Q>
<P>I am willing to &s;ubmit to any accu|&s;ation which &s;o candid and impartial a per&s;on as <HI>common Fame</HI> &s;hall bring a|gain&s;t me; for tho' &s;he has made but a &s;curvy &s;ort of a Blade of me; yet if her Reports will be allow'd to be au|thentick, there are <HI>other Per&s;ons</HI> in the world as bad as my &s;elf.</P>
<P>And therefore, like other polite Ma|lefactors, I heartily forgive my Accu|&s;ers, and confe&s;s that I de&s;erv'd the puni&s;hment I &s;uffer'd: I am now &s;uffi|ciently convinc'd of the folly and &s;ot|ti&s;hne&s;s of Freethinking; and were it po&s;&s;ible for me to live over my days a|gain, no body &s;hould accu&s;e me of too little Faith; no, I would believe even to &s;upererogation, and make it the &s;ole bu&s;ine&s;s of my Life to bolt new My&s;te|ries out of Scripture, and new points of
<PB N="xv" REF="14">
Faith more difficult and ab&s;tru&s;e than tho&s;e already impos'd upon Mankind, to &s;hew how good a Churchman I could be, and how much I could out&s;trip even the <HI>Athana&s;ian</HI> Believers.</P>
<P>I can &s;carce forgive my &s;elf for my childi&s;h Behaviour whil&s;t I was under your Power and Di&s;po&s;al: what had I to do with the Quarrels of the Clergy, or the Authority of the Convocation, or the Divinity of your OXFORD Ladies? Blockhead as I was! Why could not I believe every thing, pay no body, and live in as much Re|putation as my Neighbours?</P>
<P>My Eyes are now open, and the &s;tu|pidity of my late Conduct glares me full in the face; I &s;ee the fool-hardi|ne&s;s of oppo&s;ing popular Arguments and e&s;tabli&s;hed Opinions; and what mortifies me mo&s;t is, that altho' I am convinc'd of an error, yet is it too late to repent.</P>
<P>Here, methinks, you interrupt me with that notable &s;aying in your mouth, <HI>nunquam &s;era e&s;t ad bonos mores via:</HI>
<PB N="xvi" REF="15">
Pho! Doctor, that's all fooli&s;h, an|tiquated &s;tuff! Our modern Ethicks &s;ay, that it is too late to repent, when it is too late to get any thing by it. Very well, &s;ay you; but pray, Sir, is not <HI>Virtue its own Reward?</HI> O fie, Doctor! wor&s;e and wor&s;e &s;till; Hunger, Thir&s;t, and Nakedne&s;s are but poor Rewards, and (in my opi|nion) wor&s;e than none at all.</P>
<P>I hope all young Men will take warn|ing from me, how they meddle with &s;piritual <HI>Edge Tools,</HI> and eccle&s;ia&s;tical <HI>Prize-fighters.</HI> Who, but a Fool or a Madman, would have his Pockets pick'd, or his Bones broken; or be turn'd out of a good Place, or into a na&s;ty Gaol merely for <HI>thinking</HI> like one <HI>in his Sen&s;es?</HI> We were &s;ome time ago a&s;&s;ured by a very great and reverend Per&s;on, that <HI>Freethinking is not now the way to Preferment:</HI> and has not he made his word good? Are not the greate&s;t Bigots and Blockheads made the great|e&s;t <HI>Plurali&s;ts?</HI> Are not the be&s;t <HI>Par&s;o|nages,</HI> and the fatte&s;t <HI>Sine Cures</HI> the Re|ward
<PB N="xvii" REF="16">
of Lazine&s;s and Ignorance? If this is not a good Argument again&s;t <HI>thinking freely,</HI> I would know what is.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, <HI>Freethinking</HI> is unfa&s;hiona|ble, and makes a Man look &s;ingular in all Company; it puts him to the con|tinual fatigue of proving white to be white, and black to be black, for which he is &s;ure to be heartily pitied and de|&s;pis'd.</P>
<P>The whole world is govern'd by a <HI>majority:</HI> A powerful Monarch thinks it a good argument for clapping up a Peace with all convenient &s;peed. The &s;ame weighty argument has induc'd many an holy Pa&s;tor to for&s;wear him&s;elf, and comply with the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of the Times. In &s;hort, it makes Kings and Parliament Men; &s;ettles Money Bills and Articles of Faith.</P>
<P>Another good argument again&s;t <HI>think|ing freely,</HI> or (which is ju&s;t the &s;ame) again&s;t <HI>thinking at all,</HI> is, that it im|pairs the Con&s;titution, debilitates the Nerves, renders the Countenance &s;al|low and wrinkled, is a great nouri&s;her
<PB N="xviii" REF="17">
of the Vapours, and very much inca|pacitates young Fellows for the &s;ociety of Ladies. This argument has of late done great &s;ervice to the Church at OXFORD.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, <HI>Freethinking</HI> is apt to make Men think contemptuou&s;ly of Excom|munication, and Ab&s;olution, and Be|nediction, and Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience, and Hereditary Right, and Per&mdash;y, and &mdash; other &s;uch like <HI>Apo&s;tolical</HI> Doctrines of the Church.</P>
<P>The&s;e few, but unan&s;werable argu|ments will, I hope, be of &s;ome u&s;e to &s;top the growing mi&s;chiefs of <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and private <HI>Enquiry;</HI> I have felt the &s;mart of them my &s;elf, and would &s;hew others the Rock upon which I &s;plit: all that I can do farther towards this pious end, is to make a publick Recantation of my Errors, which I freely do in the following words.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>Whereas I <HI>N. A.</HI> formerly Member of St. <HI>JOHN</HI>'S College in <HI>OXFORD,</HI> and now Citizen of the wide World, have, by &s;ome
<PB N="xix" REF="18">
late poi&s;onous Writings, been unwarily and fatally mi&s;led into divers heretical and damnable Opinions, incon&s;i&s;tent with the Pro&s;perity of the <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> Church of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and <HI>her vi&s;ible</HI> Governors, by pro|fe&s;&s;ing an ill-grounded Zeal for the <HI>invi|&s;ible</HI> Church and her <HI>invi&s;ible</HI> King; and whereas, in con&s;equence of this unhappy Delu&s;ion, I thought my &s;elf at liberty to make u&s;e of tho&s;e faculties and abilities which God Almighty had given me, im|piou&s;ly pre&s;uming that he had given them me for the &s;ame purpo&s;e; I do hereby publickly, &s;olemnly, and totally renounce, retract, abjure, and forever di&s;claim the afore&s;aid damnable Doctrines and Opini|ons; and I do mo&s;t humbly intreat the <HI>Con|vocation</HI> to pardon (if it be venial) this great and heinous Offence, faithfully promi&s;ing that I will for the future conform my &s;elf to all their Doctrines, Opinions, Decla|rations, Interpretations, and Deci&s;ions what&s;oever, however &s;eemingly unju&s;t in them&s;elves, or palpably contradictory to each other, in defiance of my own <HI>Rea|&s;on</HI> and <HI>private Judgment,</HI> as becomes a
<PB N="xx" REF="19">
good Churchman, and a &s;trenuous <HI>Con|tender for the Faith once delivered to the Saints.</HI></P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>N. AMHURST.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Having made this ample Recanta|tion, I expect from henceforward to be look'd upon and treated as a &s;ound <HI>Believer,</HI> and to reap all the Privileges and Advantages which belong to that glorious Character; I expect that no body will think the wor&s;e of me, if I loo&s;en a little the Reins of my Life, &s;ince I have &s;traiten'd tho&s;e of my Faith; and if I &s;hould be accidentally caught tripping in any of the modi&s;h Frail|ties of Fle&s;h and Blood, that I may be excus'd, as other great and orthodox Sinners have been, in this kind man|ner; <HI>Well, well, for all that, the young Man has &s;ound Principles, and hates the Bi&s;hop of</HI> Bangor.</P>
<P>I cannot forbear mentioning, upon this occa&s;ion, that my pre&s;ent happy Conver&s;ion is in a great mea&s;ure owing to the late ingenious Writings of the
<PB N="xxi" REF="20">
Reverend Dr. <HI>H&mdash;re,</HI> which make the deeper Impre&s;&s;ion upon me, becau&s;e he was once in the &s;ame Errors with my &s;elf, tho' he has not thought fit to re|tract them <HI>formally</HI> as I have done: but as I have now li&s;ted my &s;elf under him, I hope no body will be &s;urpriz'd if I &s;hould tack about again, provided the <HI>irre&s;i&s;tible Importunities</HI> of Self-intere&s;t and the Convocation &s;hould make it ne|ce&s;&s;ary; being convinc'd that <HI>Occa&s;ional Conformity</HI> is not a Doctrine belonging to <HI>one</HI> &s;ett of Men only, but that it is grown con&s;i&s;tent with the Characters of our be&s;t <HI>Churchmen.</HI></P>
<P>Thus have I reconcil'd my &s;elf to the Church again; and to convince you that I &s;incerely believe you enter'd un|willingly into the mea&s;ures of my Ex|clu&s;ion, give me leave to acquaint the World with what, I have heard, you were plea&s;ed to do in my favour.</P>
<P>I am informed, and pretty credibly too, that when Complaints began to multiply and grow loud again&s;t me, you did, in your great Goodne&s;s, con|de&s;cend
<PB N="xxii" REF="21">
to write a Letter to a certain reverend Relation of mine, to acquaint him with my Behaviour, and the Cha|racter I labour'd under, de&s;iring at the &s;ame time his Advice <HI>what to do with me;</HI> and that you put it in his Power to keep me in my Fellow&s;hip, or to turn me out of it. What was the Con&s;e|quence is well enough known: but I mu&s;t ob&s;erve that this Procedure was, tho' hone&s;tly and candidly de&s;igned, very incon&s;i&s;tent with Truth and Ju|&s;tice: for if, by my Conduct, I did either actually de&s;erve, or, in your Con&s;cience, &s;eem'd to de&s;erve, what I have &s;ince &s;uffer'd, I ought to &s;uffer it, whether the <HI>u&s;ual</HI> Tenderne&s;s of a near Relation interceded in my behalf or not; and, on the other &s;ide, if I did not de&s;erve it, neither ought I to have &s;uffer'd it, tho' my <HI>own Father</HI> concurr'd in the Sentence again&s;t me. But I believe you were led into this, by your unwil|lingne&s;s to di&s;oblige an old Friend who <HI>keeps a good Hou&s;e,</HI> and has <HI>good Wine</HI> in his Cellar.</P>
<P><PB N="xxiii" REF="22">I am farther informed that you have &s;ince waited upon this reverend Gen|tleman, to notify unto him what was done again&s;t me, and how loth you were to comply with it upon his account; and that you found him &s;o perfectly &s;atisfied with your Conduct, and &s;o inveterately enrag'd again&s;t me, that he declar'd in the mo&s;t ungentle manner, <HI>He car'd not what became of me.</HI> Hei mihi!</P>
<P>As you are a Per&s;on of great Can|dour, and equal Integrity, I will cha|ritably &s;uppo&s;e that you play'd no fal&s;e Play; but that you u&s;ed no unju&s;t Arts to rob me of the Affections of &s;o <HI>valuable</HI> a Friend; but that you repre&s;ented my Ca&s;e to him in the faire&s;t and mo&s;t im|partial manner: I will &s;uppo&s;e this, tho' I have been told to the contrary.</P>
<P>If you dealt hone&s;tly with me, and honourably with him, you a&s;&s;ured him that it was &s;olely on account of my obnoxious Opinions that I lo&s;t my Fel|low&s;hip; or that, if you aggravated my bad Principles with bad Practices,

<P>The pravity and &s;infulne&s;s of my Opinions I have &s;ufficiently confe&s;s'd and repented of in my Recantation; and as for Morality, I hope no body can charge me with violating that part of it which relates to <HI>Friend&s;hip, Ho|nour,</HI> and <HI>common Hone&s;ty;</HI> if I have been le&s;s careful of that, which in|jures my &s;elf only, it is a frailty that is common to Humanity, and almo&s;t in&s;eparable from it: perhaps I now and then <HI>take my Gla&s;s too freely,</HI> or <HI>ki&s;s a pretty Woman in a Corner;</HI> but I pay <HI>my Debts</HI> hone&s;tly, and <HI>defraud no body.</HI> I wi&s;h I had not, at this time, in&s;tances before my Eyes of Men mo&s;t notoriou&s;ly guilty of <HI>di&s;hone&s;t, knavi&s;h</HI> Immorality; which, in my Creed, is much the wor&s;e of the two.</P>

<P>But to return to my dear &s;elf once more. I have indeed been a very naughty Boy; but, in my Lay-Opi|nion,
<PB N="xxvi" REF="25">
I have done pretty ample Pe|nance for all my Offences: I have lo&s;t a <HI>good</HI> Fellow&s;hip, and (which was much more valuable to me) your <HI>good Opinion;</HI> my Enemies in&s;ult my Mi&s;|fortunes, and even my Friends blame my Imprudence for bringing them up|on my &s;elf; the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> look upon me as a Bigot to the <HI>wor&s;t</HI> of Principles; and the <HI>la&s;t</HI> as a Betrayer of the <HI>be&s;t,</HI> by maintaining them in too great a Lati|tude, and with too much Openne&s;s: The&s;e <HI>pity</HI> me, and tho&s;e <HI>de&s;pi&s;e</HI> me; nay (to tell you a Secret) I began to de&s;pi&s;e my &s;elf, 'till I had made <HI>my Peace</HI> again with the Church.</P>
<P>I was particularly unfortunate in the Di&s;plea&s;ure of a <HI>pretty female Relation,</HI> who (upon hearing that I was <HI>expell'd</HI> from the <HI>Univer&s;ity;</HI> for that is our Country Phra&s;e) exclaim'd with &s;ome Vehemence, that &s;he was &s;orry I &s;hould bring &s;uch a Di&s;grace upon the FAMILY! Now as I ought to be as much con|cern'd for the Honour of the AMHUR|STIAN Family as this fair Lady; I have
<PB N="xxvii" REF="26">
&s;eriou&s;ly taken it into my Con&s;idera|tion, how my <HI>Exclu&s;ion</HI> could po&s;&s;ibly bring any Di&s;grace upon it; and after Examination find quite the contrary to what this fair Kin&s;woman of mine im|plicitly alledges to be true: for</P>
<P N="1">1. The Honour of our Hou&s;e is &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed by our Predece&s;&s;ors, who (it is well known) were Heroes, and Patriots, and Lovers of their Coun|try in the wor&s;t of Times, and knock'd down Giants, and &s;lew Dragons; that it is out of the Power of any of its corrupt De&s;cendants to bring any real Di&s;grace upon it.</P>
<P N="2">2. Lord have Mercy upon many of the noble&s;t Families in <HI>England,</HI> if the Vices of the pre&s;ent Generation are any Blots to the original Stock it &s;elf.</P>
<P N="3">3. On the contrary, &s;uppo&s;ing I have degenerated from the Virtues I am Heir to; yet my <HI>Exclu&s;ion,</HI> in&s;tead of bringing a Di&s;grace upon my Family, is the be&s;t Ju&s;tification of it. I would a&s;k any rea|&s;onable Chri&s;tian, whether the Fall of the Apo&s;tate Angels brought any Di&s;|grace
<PB N="xxviii" REF="27">
upon the <HI>Angelick Family?</HI> Or whether it would not have rather &s;eem|ed a Di&s;grace to it, if they had not fell. Thus, had I continued in the high and eminent Station of a Fellow of St. JOHN'S College in OXFORD, I might indeed have brought Di&s;grace upon my Family; but being ca&s;t down from thence, into the low and grovel|ing Condition, in which I now am, it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to do it, and my <HI>worthy</HI> Relations need be under no Ap|prehen&s;ions upon my account.</P>
<P>Your Goodne&s;s, Sir, will pardon this Digre&s;&s;ion, and will not, I believe, think it wholly impertinent: but you will ob|&s;erve, how apt Authors are to contra|dict them&s;elves; I &s;et out with a&s;&s;uring you, that I would not, like other De|dicators, make you any Compliments; and yet, by confe&s;&s;ing &s;uch an heap of Iniquities, have I made you the great|e&s;t Compliment that the mo&s;t ful&s;ome Wretch in this Art could po&s;&s;ibly invent. How much ought that Man to be re|&s;pected (e&s;pecially by the <HI>Clergy</HI> and the
<PB N="xxix" REF="28">
<HI>Ladies</HI>) who remov'd &s;uch a Nui&s;ance out of a polite and chri&s;tian Society?</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t complain of one thing; whether rea&s;onably or not, let the World judge: when I was voted out of your College, and the Nui&s;ance was thereby remov'd; I thought the Re&s;ent|ments of the <HI>holy ones</HI> would have pro|ceeded no farther; I am &s;ure the Cau&s;e of Virtue and &s;ound Religion (which I was thought to offend) required no more; nor could it be of any po&s;&s;ible Advantage to the Church to de&s;cend into my private Affairs, and &s;tir up my Creditors in the Univer&s;ity to take hold of me at a Di&s;advantage, before I could get any Money return'd to pay 'em; but there are &s;ome Per&s;ons in the World, who think nothing unju&s;t or inhuman in the Pro&s;ecution of their implacable Revenge.</P>
<P>As this is a very material Circum|&s;tance of my Life, and of the temper of <HI>&s;ome others,</HI> I will give the Reader a &s;hort account of this matter truly and impartially, as I will atte&s;t it upon my

Honour or my Oath, if &s;o vile a Fel|low may be believ'd in either.</P>
<P>I was di&s;mi&s;s'd from College on <HI>Monday</HI> the 29th of <HI>June;</HI> the next Day I went fourteen or fifteen Miles into <HI>Berk&s;hire</HI> to &s;ee a Relation, where I &s;taid till the <HI>Friday</HI> following: I had before &s;ent for Money to di&s;charge all my Debts at OXFORD, being ap|priz'd of the De&s;ign of turning me out of College. On <HI>Saturday</HI> Morn|ing Mr. <HI>W.</HI> my Mercer called upon me at my Lodgings, and a&s;k'd me how long I &s;hould &s;tay in Town; I an&s;wer'd, 'till I receiv'd a Bill for Money to pay what I owed there, and no longer. He went away &s;eemingly well &s;atisy'd, and neither a&s;k'd me for Money, nor deliver'd me his Bill, nor indeed had he written it out: but when I came home to my Lodgings at Night, the Chamberlain told me that Mr. <HI>Cox</HI> the Sergeant had enquir'd for me. The next Morning I &s;ent for him, and de&s;ired to know his Bu&s;ine&s;s, and he told me he had a Writ again&s;t
<PB N="xxxi" REF="30">
me at the Suit of Mr. <HI>W.</HI> but it being <HI>Sunday</HI> did not &s;erve it. By this time I had receiv'd a Note for Money pay|able at Sight, which (as things it &s;eems were order'd) brought me Liberty a|long with it. I then waited upon Mr. <HI>W.</HI> and enquir'd of him the Rea|&s;on of &s;uch uncommon a Proceeding. In an&s;wer to which, with the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion and Marks of Sorrow, he told me that he was in&s;tigated to it by <HI>Per&s;ons of my own College,</HI> who a&s;&s;ured him, that if he ever expected his Mo|ney, he mu&s;t arre&s;t me immediately; for, &s;aid they, he will go off privately to morrow morning, will pay no bo|dy, nor will ever be heard of again, for he de&s;igns to <HI>go into the Army;</HI> which you know, Sir, at OXFORD, &s;ignifies the &s;ame as running away. I &s;hew'd him my Note, and offer'd to leave it with him, which he refu&s;ed, de&s;iring to be forgiven this ra&s;h and &s;illy Action in the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate man|ner; he profe&s;s'd that he had rather have cut off his right Hand than have
<PB N="xxxii" REF="31">
done it, and was overjoy'd that the Writ was not &s;erv'd, with much more to the &s;ame effect; and often repeated it, that he &s;hould never have done it, if <HI>&s;ome Per&s;ons of my own College</HI> had not urged him to it.</P>
<P>Herein again, Sir, I perfectly ac|quit you, well knowing that you have too much Humanity and Good-Nature to be engag'd in &s;o mean-&s;pirited an Action; your Friend&s;hip for the Re|verend Gentleman my Relation, whom I ju&s;t now mention'd, would not have &s;uffer'd you to do it, were there no other Motive: but be&s;ides that, I am confident you are too well acquaint|ed with the World, not to know that if <HI>every one</HI> were to be &s;erved in the &s;ame rigid manner, they might not come off quite &s;o well as I did.</P>
<P>Now I am making my Complaints to you, another thing comes into my Head, which I think very hard, if it be true.</P>
<P>I am told that you had Information of &s;ome of the mo&s;t material Secrets of
<PB N="xxxiii" REF="32">
my Life, from <HI>a Quarter,</HI> where you ought lea&s;t to <HI>expect,</HI> or I to <HI>fear</HI> it. I could not &s;u&s;pect the Per&s;on, I mean, to be capable of &s;uch di&s;ingenuous Dealing; neither did I &s;u&s;pect that I had any Enemy in the World, who would &s;toop &s;o low as to encourage it. But what &s;hall we &s;ay? <HI>Birds of a Fea|ther,</HI> &amp;c. &s;ays a good old Proverb.</P>
<P>It is &s;ome Con&s;olation to me under all my Misfortunes, that I am not the only Per&s;on, who has &s;uffer'd for hete|rodox Opinions in OXFORD; I have &s;een with my own Eyes many a young Fellow deny'd his <HI>Degree</HI> upon this Account; I have &s;een them hated, calumniated and in&s;ulted in the mo&s;t di&s;couraging man|ner; &s;ome have been expell'd before <HI>me,</HI> and we have one remarkable in&s;tance &s;ince, how zealous the reverend HEADS of Colleges are to pluck up <HI>Here&s;y</HI> by the Roots, and purge away the la&s;t Dregs of tho&s;e pernicious Principles which mu&s;t otherwi&s;e end in the Ruin of the <HI>be&s;t con&s;tituted Church in the World.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="xxxiv" REF="33">You, Sir, in a particular manner de|&s;erve our Thanks, for your many &s;tre|nuous Pulpit-Attacks upon tho&s;e two trouble&s;ome <HI>Here&s;iarchs, common Sen&s;e</HI> and the Bi&s;hop of <HI>B&mdash;r:</HI> I do not men|tion <HI>common Hone&s;ty,</HI> tho' he is &s;orely &s;u&s;pected of Ill-will to the Church, be|cau&s;e he has not as yet been formally excommunicated;
<Q>Quod diu multumque de&s;ideratum.</Q></P>
<P>I hope what I have &s;aid is &s;ufficient to vindicate my &s;elf from a Report, that I am the Author of a late &s;candalous Libel, called, <HI>A Letter from a Student in Grub&s;treet to a Reverend High-Prie&s;t and Head of a College in</HI> OXFORD, &amp;c. which, &s;ome People, &s;uppos'd was le|vell'd at you: I prote&s;t to you, Doctor, with one Hand laid orthodoxly upon my Heart, and both my Eyes &s;train'd up to Heav'n in a very religious manner, that <HI>I know nothing of the matter;</HI> nay, I would &s;wear it, were I not well a&s;&s;ur'd that no body will pre&s;ume to que&s;tion
<PB N="xxxv" REF="34">
the bare Word of one who liv'd <HI>three</HI> Years (under the Influence of your good Example) in a College where <HI>Lying</HI> and <HI>fal&s;e Witne&s;s</HI> are &s;o exemplarily puni&s;h'd and di&s;courag'd.</P>
<P>I am glad to hear that &s;trict Enquiry is made after the Author and Printer of that villainous Libel, and that the Pro&s;ecution of them is undertaken by &s;uch able Hands as that eminent Biblio|pole, the worthy Mr. <HI>J&mdash;h B&mdash;y&mdash;r,</HI> and the Right Reverend &mdash;</P>
<P>Let me conclude with a&s;&s;uring you that however de&s;picably you may think of me, I will &s;till retain the &s;ame good Opinion of you, that I ever had, and will not fail to pay my Re&s;pects to you whenever an Opportunity offers; nay, I will frame Opportunities on purpo&s;e, rather than be wanting in this parti|cular.</P>
<P>That you may long live a Pattern of Learning and Piety to our famous Univer&s;ity; that St. JOHN'S College may long enjoy &s;o faithful a Steward and indulgent a Father; that as a Re|ward

<L>The World, a rude, unfa&s;hion'd <HI>Embryo</HI> lay,</L>
<L>Eternal Night, without a glimp&s;e of Day,</L>
<L>Earth, &s;eas, and heaven, in one blind <HI>Chaos</HI> thrown,</L>
<L>And years, and months, and days, were names unknown,</L>
<L>'Till God mark'd out th' interminable &s;pace,</L>

<L><PB N="2" REF="39">Wide o'er the Void his genial Wings he &s;pread,</L>

<L>Let there be Light, &s;aid God; and &s;udden light</L>
