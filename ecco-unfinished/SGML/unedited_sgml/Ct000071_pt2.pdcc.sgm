<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>COn&s;idering the Proverb, That <HI>Too much Mettle is dangerous in a blind Mare</HI>; when the fam'd Author of that idoliz'd piece, <HI>CYDER, A POEM</HI>, fir&s;t mounted upon the back of <HI>Ambiti|on</HI>, his chiefe&s;t Care &s;hould have been to &s;ecure the Reins; for I remember the old Jocky <HI>Seneca</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Habet hoc vitium omnis Ambitio, non re&s;picit</HI>.</P>
<P>I do not think there is any Work ex|tant, that hath alarm'd the World more
<PB N="iv" REF="4">
than his; and bin I may &s;ay, &s;ome years, &s;o much the talk and hopes of the Pub|lick; e&s;pecially tho&s;e under his own <HI>Me|ridian</HI>; Nor indeed has it fail'd in giving great Satisfaction, being generally care&s;|&s;ed with that fondne&s;s, which almo&s;t de|&s;erves the Name of <HI>Dotage</HI>: Thoug$ the Succe&s;s is not &s;o wonderful, if we be|lieve the Poet, That
<Q>Expectation makes the Ble&s;&s;ing dear.</Q></P>
<P>And if we ob&s;erve, It had not only the Advantage of being introduc'd un|der the Umbrage of <HI>Milton</HI>; but came al&s;o flying upon the Wings of <HI>Fame</HI>&punc; not to mention the many <HI>Heroes</HI> who were &s;ummoned to defend it.</P>
<P>Wherein all its Beautys con&s;i&s;t, is not obvious, I dare pre&s;ume, to every Reader; It being in many places made Artificially dark, to prevent every com|mon Under&s;tanding from peeping into the Bottom of it; but &s;uch is the Genius of this Age, to admire <HI>Name</HI> and <HI>Novelty</HI>&punc;
<PB N="v" REF="5">
That they have now rai&s;ed the Author to the highe&s;t Cla&s;s in the <HI>Mu&s;es</HI> School; Nor will he need any future <HI>Apotheo&s;is</HI>, to immortalize his Name, as long as <HI>CY|DER A POEM</HI>, lies &s;ecurely bound in Sheeps-skin; For we may take notice, That notwith&s;tanding he falls &s;o far &s;hort, both of the <HI>Diction</HI>, and <HI>Harmony</HI> of <HI>Milton</HI>; yet he is addre&s;&s;ed with the Title of being his <HI>Poetical Son</HI>, as <HI>Milton</HI> was of <HI>Spencer</HI>, tho' there indeed the <HI>Son</HI> ex|ceeded the <HI>Father</HI>, and the Copy out|&s;hone the Original: But however, there are, I make no que&s;tion, who breaking out into Wonderful <HI>Interjections</HI>; di&s;dain not to &s;ay, he was Out-vied by them both; and this is ea&s;ily conjectur'd, when we find &s;ome Per&s;ons have &s;o far <HI>Apo&s;tatiz'd</HI> to Wor&s;hip him, as the <HI>Numen Commune</HI>, even in C&mdash;&s;ts C&mdash;ch; whil&s;t others have &s;ung his <HI>Nugae Canorae</HI> about, as the <HI>Grecians</HI> did the Works of <HI>Homer</HI>, at their Village Fea&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="6">Now I would not be thought fond of traducing his Performance, any far|ther than I could compel his Humility to acknowledge, how much he has fallen &s;hort of <HI>Milton</HI>; and what he &s;tands In|debted to <HI>Virgil</HI> for his many Embelli&s;h|ments; who has been all along the Prop of his Fancy, and whom he as carefully follows, as a Blind Man does his Dog in a String; So that <HI>Invention</HI> which is one of the greate&s;t Ble&s;&s;ings to a Poet, is not &s;o peculiarly his <HI>Talent</HI>.</P>
<P>As for the profe&s;&s;ing him&s;elf a <HI>Votary</HI> to <HI>Milton</HI>'s Mu&s;e, I greatly fear he will be Superanuated, before he can attain to his Proficiency, for by a little Compa|ri&s;on we &s;oon may find a Difference; Nor can I think the be&s;t Doctor of <HI>Mu&s;ick</HI> round the <HI>Theatre</HI>, will affirm their being tuned in <HI>&V;ni&s;on</HI>; and therefore without much Offence he may be Challeng'd in the Words of <HI>Menalcas</HI> to <HI>Damae|tas</HI>.</P>

<P>Tho' to do Ju&s;tice; a little allowance mu&s;t be made him, becau&s;e &s;ometime <HI>Milton</HI> &s;ung darkly, as it is reported, from the Name of <HI>Homer</HI>, that he did; But this our Author never was &s;o happy, to enjoy the lucid Intervals of a dark Man, and that I might &s;atisfie him I have not the lea&s;t ill Will towards his exceeding both tho&s;e Worthy Poets, if his Friends, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the <HI>Quadrangle, inter alios</HI>, a Gentleman that has an <HI>endle&s;s &s;tore of &V;niver&s;al Knowledge</HI>; approve of it for his Good, I'll &s;end him a Needle for the purpo&s;e, that he may afford us the plea|&s;ure, to hear one Tune from him, like a Blind <HI>Bull finch</HI>; and that he may not

<P>Mr. <HI>Sheepwa&s;h</HI> being one of a profound penetration ob&s;erves; That the <HI>Cut</HI> be|fore the Title Page of the <HI>Anonymous</HI> Book upon <HI>Cyder</HI>, being the very &s;ame with that placed before the &s;econd <HI>Georgic</HI> of <HI>Virgil</HI>, intimates &s;omething of a De&s;ign, that the <HI>Author</HI> would in&s;inuate his, to bear the &s;ame Name; whereas (&s;ays he) it be|ing baptized <HI>Miltonian Ver&s;e</HI>, The <HI>Sculp|ture</HI> before <HI>Paradi&s;e lo&s;t</HI> had been more proper; and then the mo&s;t Judicious Mr. <HI>Sheepwa&s;h</HI> very &s;martly took notice, That there were no <HI>Apples</HI> upon <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Trees, but <HI>Oak-Apples</HI>; Nor could I per|&s;wade, him they made the be&s;t <HI>Cyder</HI>; but however, to excu&s;e the Matter as well as I could; I inform'd him that the <HI>Author</HI>

<P>Yet I cannot but &s;ay in deference to $he Author, as being a Man of all parts $f Speech, That &s;ince he has taken &s;uch $$eat Pains to copy after <HI>Virgil</HI>, as I $ave done my &s;elf the Honour to copy $ter him, e&s;pecially his 40 and 43d $ages; That his two Books were high|$ de&s;erving the Name of <HI>Georgies</HI>; $nd if I might be thought worthy to $vi&s;e poor <HI>Jacob Ton&s;on</HI>, becau&s;e of his $eat Charge and Family, if it were $en Years before the next Edition $mes out, to have a Glorious Title

Page added to it, beginning, <HI>Two Spick and Span new Georgies, in Imitation of</HI> Virgil, <HI>Written in Miltonian Ver&s;e</HI>; and then I'll engage for the Sale.</P>
<P>But now, lea&s;t it may be thought$ flatter the Author, becau&s;e he is a Gen|tleman of &s;ome Sub&s;tance and Figure having Land within a Mile of <HI>Perna&s;|&s;us</HI>, and a great <HI>Copia Verborum</HI> of his own to Stock it; I will put down the beginning of <HI>Virgil</HI>'s two <HI>Georgie</HI>'s, and let the Learned Reader compare them with the <HI>Miltonian</HI> ones, for Example&punc; <HI>Virgil</HI> begins his Fir&s;t

<P>But certainly, after all; methinks tho&s;e Gentlemen and Ladies, are very little be|holding to him for paying his Debts of Charity, &s;ince <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Gods were the fir&s;t Motives to his Gratitude; yet I can hardly forbear thinking; that he rai&s;es <HI>Encomiums</HI> on all that Train of Nobility and Gentry, only to put him|&s;elf under their Protection, and if &s;o, he is very Extravagant; to covet &s;uch a Number of <HI>Patrons</HI>, when even <HI>Vir|gil</HI> and <HI>Horace</HI>, contented them&s;elves with but one <HI>Maecenas</HI>; I cannot but
<PB N="xii" REF="12">
take Notice of it, becau&s;e having &s;o ma|ny Friends to vi&s;it, he affords us but little of his Company in the <HI>Orchat</HI>, and and then he is in &s;uch a roving Temper, that we can hardly enjoy him above a Page or two, before he makes &s;ome other ramble, by which we may perceive the Spirit of <HI>Cyder</HI> is very <HI>Volatil</HI>; though ten to one but he justifies him&s;elf from the Authority of <HI>Homer</HI>, who takes up great part of his Second Book in flatter|ing his Country-men.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Author</HI> in his Second Book &s;till waits a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly upon <HI>Virgil</HI>; but is &s;o mannerly not to follow too clo&s;e at his Heels, for <HI>Virgil</HI> begins his Second <HI>Geor|gie</HI>:
<Q><L>Hactenus arvorum cultus, &amp; Sidera Caeli:</L>
<L>Nunc te Bacche canam&mdash;</L>

I find he is infinitely obliged to <HI>Virgil</HI>, for the mo&s;t lively Complement or Fan|cy, who &s;peaking to <HI>Bacchus</HI> says,

<P>Which is almo&s;t a literal Tran&s;lation, only <HI>mutatis mutandis</HI>; and then after tel|ing every Body, that he has &s;ent him the Book beyond Seas, which I &s;uppo&s;e the young Gentleman is to make his Companion in his Travels, as <HI>Alexander</HI> did the Works of <HI>Homer</HI>, in his long March from <HI>Macedon</HI> to <HI>India</HI>, he goes on like <HI>Virgil</HI>.</P>

I wonder any body will de|mean them&s;elves &s;o much as to conver&s;e with dirty Peo|ple that walk on Foot. A Gentleman &s;hould never be &s;een in the Street out of a Chair or a Coach; I do not mean a filthy Hackney-Coach, which is enough to make a Man that con&s;ults his Appetite, puke in a Morning; for 'tis Nicety in Ta&s;te that di&s;tingui&s;hes a Man of Parts.</P>
<P>No Per&s;on can ever lay Claim to Wit and fine think|ing, that does not lie &s;oft a Nights, wear clean Lin|nen a days, and eat with a peculiar kind of Delicacy at all times; for the&s;e things are as nece&s;&s;ary to the forming of a bright Genius, as clean Straw and Chalk are to the whitening the Fle&s;h of an <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> Calf.

<P>WHoever hath already read, or will yet give him&s;elf the Trouble of reading Sir <HI>Thomas More</HI>'s <HI>Utopia</HI>, may at once ea&s;ily under&s;tand both the Motive to the Writing of this <HI>Canto</HI>, and the Meaning or Drift of what is written, in Imitation of &s;o Great a Man, at this Juncture of Affairs.</P>
<P>The main Burden of his Book indeed &s;eems to be for taking away all <HI>Property</HI>, and levelling or laying Things in <HI>common</HI>, upon an imeginary Regulation of <HI>Govern|ment</HI>: But our <HI>Birds</HI> here &s;ing of another E&s;tabli&s;hment in <HI>Utopia</HI>, as &s;trange and wonderful; which has &s;ome|thing more of Reality in it, than mere Fancy, Fiction, or Romance.</P>
<P>He has not told us in what Part of the World his <HI>U|topia</HI> was &s;ituated; but we need not go to the <HI>Antipodes</HI>, to find whereabouts, and in what Latitude <HI>ours</HI> lies, tho' not to be found in the Map; not far from the <HI>Streights</HI> Mouth, we may imagine, or between <HI>Scylla</HI> and <HI>Charybdis</HI>.</P>
<P>'Tis natural both for Man and Bea&s;t to love his own native Country be&s;t. Ought not I to prefer my old Acquaintance, my old Friends, or even my old Shoes, (that King <HI>James</HI> the I&s;t &s;aid were ea&s;ie&s;t for his Feet) before Strangers, Sharpers, and Intruders; Hoghen-Moghens, <HI>Hugonots</HI>, and Wooden Shoe-makers? In a Word, can any one of Sen&s;e and Rea&s;on, be &s;o barba|rous to his own Bowels, as to undervalue, undermine and undo his natural-fellow-free-born Subjects, for any interloping <HI>Canary-Birds</HI>, or naturaliz'd Foreigners? I &s;o, the wi&s;e <HI>&V;topians</HI> then mu&s;t degenerate.</P>
<P>However, this is a Kind of Doggrel Poem; and ye$ I do not rival the inimitable <HI>Hudibras</HI>: But I hope i$ may pa&s;s for Burle&s;que, Trave&s;ty, or jingling Rhim$ at lea&s;t, among our native People. And &s;o fare it we$$ Good Night <HI>Country-men</HI>.</P>

<HEAD>To the READER.</HEAD>
<P>I Can neither call this Piece of <HI>Tully</HI>'s nor my own, being much altered from the Original, not only by the change of the Style, but by Addition and Sub&s;traction. I believe you will be better pleas'd, to receive it, as I did, at the fir&s;t &s;ight; for to me <HI>Cicero</HI> did not &s;o much appear to write, as <HI>Cato</HI> to &s;peak; and to do right to my Au|thor, I believe no Character of any Per&s;on was ever better drawn to the Life than this. Therefore neither con&s;ider <HI>Cicero</HI>, nor Me, but <HI>Cato</HI> him&s;elf, who being then rais'd from the Dead to &s;peak the Language of that Age and Place; neither the di|&s;tance of Place or Time makes it le&s;s po&s;&s;ible to rai&s;e him now to &s;peak ours.</P>
<P>Though I dare not compare my Copy with the Original, yet you will find it mention'd here, how much Fruits are improv'd by Grafting; and here, by grafting Ver&s;e upon Pro&s;e, &s;ome of the&s;e &s;everer Arguments may receive a more mild and plea&s;ing Ta&s;te.</P>
<P><HI>Cato</HI> &s;ays (in another Place) of him&s;elf, that he learn'd to &s;peak <HI>Greek</HI> between the Seventieth and Eightieth Year of his Age, beginning that &s;o late, he may not yet be too old to learn <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>, be|ing now between his Seventeenth and Eighteenth Hundred Year.

<P>THAT Learned Critick, the younger <HI>Scalige$</HI> comparing the two great Orators, &s;ays, tha$ nothing can be taken from <HI>Demo&s;thenes,</HI> nor added t$ <HI>Tully;</HI> and if there be any Fault in the la&s;t, it i$ the Re&s;umption, or dwelling too long upon his Argu+ments: For which rea&s;on having intended to Tran+&s;late this Piece into Pro&s;e, (where Tran&s;lation ough$ to be &s;trict) finding the Matter very proper for Ver&s;$ I took the Liberty, to leave out what was only nece&s;+&s;ary to that Age, and Place, and to take, or ad$ what was proper to this pre&s;ent Age, and Occa&s;ion; b$ laying his Sen&s;e clo&s;er, and in fewer words, accordin$ to the Style and Ear of the&s;e Times. The Three fir$$ Parts I dedicate to my old Friends, to take off tho&s;$ melancholy Reflections, which the Sen&s;e of Age, Infi$+mity, and Death may give them. The la&s;t part $word$ think nece&s;&s;ary for the Conviction of tho&s;e many, wh$ believe not, or at lea&s;t mind not the Immortality $word$ the Soul, of which the Scripture &s;peaks only po&s;itiv$+ly, as a Lawgiver, with an <HI>Ip&s;e dixit;</HI> but it may b$ they neither believe that (from which they eithe$ make Doubts, or Sport) nor tho&s;e, who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s $word$ is to interpret it, &s;uppo&s;ing they do it only for the$ own Ends: But $f a Heathen Philo&s;opher bring &s;uc$ Arguments from Rea&s;on, Nature, and Second Cau&s;e&punc; which none of our Athei&s;tical Sophi&s;ters can confut$ if they may &s;tand convinced, that there is an I$+mortality of the Soul, I hope they will &s;o weigh th$ Con&s;equences, as neither to talk, nor live as if the$ were no &s;uch Thing.</P>

<L>The Sparks of Fire did her Black Ne&s;t annoy,</L>

<HEAD>The Husband, A POEM.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>LIFE was in&s;pir'd, the fir&s;t Life was Divine,</L>
<L>Then Life divided was: The Number Two</L>
<L>Made both unequal; but the chiefe&s;t &s;ign</L>
<L>Of Duty is to think, and then to do:</L>
<L>Both which had purchas'd a perpetual Life,</L>
<L>If <HI>Adam</HI> had been equal with his Wife.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For then inferior Woman had not &s;trove</L>
<L>To tempt her Monarch: Who did thoughtle&s;s yield,</L>
<L>Seeing he had none equal nor above,</L>
<L>But his Creator, in the &s;pacious Field:</L>
<L>Thinking for any there was then no room,</L>
<L>But for him&s;elf, him&s;elf to overcome.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So did one weaker, and one far below,</L>
<L>Subvert the Folly of Man's poor Conceit:</L>
<L>For he did only Good and Evil know,</L>
<L>By Pro&s;pect, not by Burthen or by Weight:</L>
<L>Thus though no living Creature well could reach</L>
<L>His Worth, yet Woman could his Will impeach.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="442">
<L>And hence it comes that all inferior Forms,</L>
<L>Traduce the worthy Shape which is above:</L>
<L>Our Ocean is di&s;tracted, by the Storms</L>
<L>Invi&s;ible: And Luck for&s;akes true Love:</L>
<L>Thus <HI>Adam</HI> though he knew the Guilt of Sin,</L>
<L>Yet knew he not the Cur&s;e which was within.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So <HI>Adam</HI>'s Dignity was over-match'd,</L>
<L>Not match'd: And &s;o Con&s;piracies de&s;troy</L>
<L>The Cau&s;e remote; but they away are &s;natch'd</L>
<L>E'er with Succe&s;s they can the &s;ame enjoy:</L>
<L>For we deceive our Memories indeed,</L>
<L>When we deprive, we &s;till hope to &s;ucceed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor <HI>Adam</HI>'s Will may &s;imply be excus'd.</L>
<L>For he had Power to re&s;train his Will:</L>
<L>Yet Fle&s;h &s;o far his Heavenly Part abus'd,</L>
<L>To &s;hew he could not be exempt from Ill:</L>
<L>And we have taken the &s;ame Pre&s;ident,</L>
<L>That we might know by our Experiment.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From <HI>Adam</HI> we derive Infirmity,</L>
<L>And &s;omewhat more: He never knew the Name</L>
<L>Of Child but Youthful, for Minority</L>
<L>Of doubtful Practice purchas'd all his Blame:</L>
<L>But (the Compleat Man which in Figure lies,</L>
<L>Being his own) he might have Prejudice.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For if we &s;leep away the Name of Child,</L>
<L>As <HI>Adam</HI> did; and when we fir&s;t awake,</L>
<L>But at full Age, or may be truly &s;til'd</L>
<L>As perfect Men by Knowledge: this doth make</L>
<L>No full di&s;proof: For we do only gue&s;s</L>
<L>Until we try bad Luck or Happine&s;s.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Gold I may know, yet never know the Weight:</L>
<L>I may di&s;cern the dusky Colour dark,</L>
<L>In &s;ome deep Vault; but never know the Height,</L>
<L>Till I de&s;cend: I hear Tunes, not the Lark,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="443">Till I approach: So <HI>Adam</HI> he did &s;ee</L>
<L>The Colour only, not the Quantity.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Adam</HI> was fir&s;t a Man, but was alone,</L>
<L>His Marriage was a thing of Con&s;equence,</L>
<L>And better Husband than him&s;elf was none,</L>
<L>Becau&s;e the fir&s;t: All Acts were Innocence</L>
<L>Except the fir&s;t, which being &s;et a&s;ide,</L>
<L><HI>Adam</HI> (to us) might &s;oon be Stellify'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Husband, with <HI>Adam</HI> did begin to make</L>
<L>Man more &s;upreme, than Nature could devi&s;e:</L>
<L>Nature (by Approbation) doth awake</L>
<L>Fancy; but Marriage makes our Fancy wi&s;e:</L>
<L>For if it thrive, we &s;till &s;eek to pre&s;erve,</L>
<L>If it thrives ill, we &s;eek how to de&s;erve.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Election is an Optick of the Soul,</L>
<L>Which chu&s;eth Men far off, among the Croud,</L>
<L>Yes whil&s;t unknown: we cannot Choice controul,</L>
<L>Although we do ob&s;cure it with a Cloud:</L>
<L>For Mode&s;ty may blu&s;h, but never can</L>
<L>Be able to re&s;i&s;t her cho&s;en Man.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Both Sexes have their Privilege alike</L>
<L>To chu&s;e: But Woman hath Prerogative:</L>
<L>She may forbear, deny, and never &s;trike</L>
<L>Till the ju&s;t Hour, but Man doth &s;till revive.</L>
<L>Each Minute's Fancy: And at fir&s;t agree</L>
<L>To know by <HI>Di&s;tance</HI>, what the Hour will be.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>All our Election is Conditional,</L>
<L>But Dotage is Election Ab&s;olute:</L>
<L>The end of both Fruition: But withal</L>
<L>The fir&s;t is pa&s;t when we enjoy the Fruit:</L>
<L>The &s;econd never doth enough enjoy,</L>
<L>Until we do the object clean de&s;troy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Dotage is &s;ervile, doth neglect, abu&s;e,</L>
<L>And (like the Spainiel) doth become more fond&punc;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="444">A doating Husband can have no Excu&s;e,</L>

</LG>

<L>She never was well match'd that cho&s;e a Man</L>

<L>The Cau&s;e: Not of her cho&s;en Love repent.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But Friends Friend is a more deceitful Path</L>
<L>Than Dotage for a Woman to conceive:</L>
<L>Love neither Thanks nor Thoughts but Freedom hath,</L>
<L>And Love to Prai&s;es may her Will bereave,</L>
<L>Not her Affection: Dotage &s;ees her own:</L>
<L>But Objects only prais'd, are &s;eldom known.</L>

<LG>
<L>Love honours be&s;t and wor&s;t, both Rich and Poor,</L>
<L>Tawny Complection, Fair, and Swarth, and Black,</L>

<L>The &s;imple End, if but enjoy it can,</L>

<LG>
<L>Nor mu&s;t a Woman, therefore give Con&s;ent</L>
<L>To take this Man, becau&s;e &s;he cannot call</L>
<L>Another, Husband: Her Affections bent</L>
<L>With being Sun-burnt; and the very All</L>
<L>Of her Intention is a crooked Piece,</L>
<L>And only hangs about the Fle&s;h or Fleece.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Humour is Nature's own Interpreter,</L>
<L>And often doth again&s;t his Will expre&s;s,</L>
<L>Caution enough to &s;ome: Who can infer</L>
<L>Judgment, by Signs of his Un&s;teadine&s;s?</L>
<L>Safe is not &s;udden, nor is violent,</L>
<L>Degrees make perfect Love, not our intent.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="445">
<L>With Humours Melancholy hath a place,</L>

<L>Stipendious Voices ever will out-bid</L>
<L>The common Rumour, which Report is grown</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Bad Fame is Black Complection to the Eye,</L>

<L>A comely Villain pitied we e&s;py,</L>
<L>Seldom by true Love, re&s;cued from the Storm,</L>
<L>For when &s;he takes the Med'cine with the Weed,</L>
<L>That Woman only, loves a Man indeed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But your prote&s;ting Suitor runs too fa&s;t,</L>
<L>He loves the Name of Husband, not the Wife:</L>
<L>The Tongue bewrays the Judgment over-pa&s;t,</L>
<L>He doth exclude Nece&s;&s;ity in Strife:</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="449">And like (the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Captains) doth propound</L>

<L>The true be&s;t Husband never doth divide</L>
<L>Affection into Rags: But holds entire:</L>
<L>To Wife his Love is one: Nor is deny'd,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Woman's Birth, with Beauty being compar'd,</L>
<L>Is nothing to the Man: His Pedigree</L>

<L>Betwixt two Mi&s;chiefs: Honour makes up three.</L>
<L>Remove that Fame, they both are excellent,</L>
<L>Add, and it makes the Ill more Eminent.</L>

<LG>
<L>Wealth &s;he may take, but cannot chu&s;e the Wealth</L>
<L>If &s;he loves well: Nor may &s;he Wealth de&s;pi&s;e,</L>
<L>Although &s;he hath enough: The outward Stealth</L>

<L>Good Nature is with Men much better far,</L>

<LG>

<LG>
<L>THat I went to warm my &s;elf in Lady <HI>Betty</HI>'s Cham|ber, becau&s;e I was Cold,</L>
<L>And I had in a Pur&s;e, Seven Pounds and Four Shillings, (be&s;ides Farthings) in Money, and Gold:</L>
<L>So becau&s;e I had been buying things for my Lady la&s;t Night,</L>
<L>I was re&s;olv'd to tell my Money, to &s;ee if it was right.</L>
<L>Now you mu&s;t know, becau&s;e my Trunk has a very bad Lock;</L>
<L>Therefore all the Money I have, which, God knows, is a very &s;mall Stock,</L>
<L>I keep in a Pocket ty'd about my middle, next my Smock.</L>
<L>So when I put up my Pur&s;e, as God would have it, my Smock was unript;</L>
<L>And in&s;tead of putting it into my Pocket, down it &s;lipt.</L>
<L>Then the Bell rung, and I went down Stairs to put my Lady to Bed;</L>
<L>When, God knows, I thought my Money as &s;afe as my Maidenhead.</L>
<L>So when I came up again, I found my Pocket very light;</L>
<L>But when I &s;earch'd and mi&s;s'd my Pur&s;e, Lord! I thought I &s;hould have &s;unk outright:</L>
<L>Lord! <HI>Madam</HI>, &s;ays <HI>Mary</HI>, how d'ye do? Indeed, &s;ays I, never wor&s;e:</L>

<L>Nay, &s;aid I, I had it in Lady <HI>Betty</HI>'s Chamber, that's a plain Ca&s;e.</L>
<L>So <HI>Mary</HI> got me to Bed, and cover'd me up warm;</L>
<L>However, &s;he &s;tole away my Garters, that I might do my &s;elf no Harm:</L>
<L>So I tumbled and to&s;s'd all Night, as you may very well think,</L>
<L>But hardly ever &s;et my Eyes together, or &s;lept a Wink.</L>
<L>So I was dream'd, methought, that we went and &s;earch'd the Folks round,</L>

<L>So next Morning we told <HI>Whittle</HI>, and he fell a &s;wearing;</L>

<L>Now you know, of all things in the World I hate a Thief:</L>
<L>However, I was re&s;olv'd to bring the Di&s;cour&s;e &s;lily about,</L>

In the fir&s;t place, if it be objected to me, that being a <HI>Layman</HI>, I ought not to have concern'd my &s;elf with Speculations, which belong to the Profe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Divinity;</HI> I cou'd An&s;wer, that perhaps, Laymen, with equal advantages of Parts and Knowledge, are not the mo&s;t incompetent Judges of Sacred things; But in the due &s;en&s;e of my own weakne&s;s and want of Learning, I plead not this: I pretend not to make my &s;elf a Judge of Faith, in others, but only to make a Confe&s;&s;ion of my own; I lay no unhallowed hand upon the Ark; but wait on it, with the Reverence that becomes me at a di|&s;tance: In the next place I will ingeniou&s;ly confe&s;s, that the helps I have us'd in this &s;mall Treati&s;e, were many of them taken from the Works of our own Reverend Divines of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> &s;o that the Weapons with which I combat Irreligion are already con&s;ecrated; though I &s;uppo&s;e they may be taken down as lawfully as the Sword of <HI>Goliah</HI> was by <HI>David,</HI> when they are to be employed for the common Cau&s;e, again&s;t the Enemies of Piety. I intend not by this to intitle them to any of my errours; which, yet, I hope are only tho&s;e of Charity to Mankind; and &s;uch as my <HI>own</HI> charity has caus'd me to commit, that of <HI>others</HI> may mor$ ea&s;ily excu&s;e. Being naturally inclin'd to Sceptici&s;m in Philo&s;ophy, I have no rea&s;on to impo&s;e my Opinions, in a Subject which is above it But whatever they are, I &s;ubmit them with all Reverence to my Mo|ther Church, accounting them no farther mine, than as they are autho|riz'd, or at lea&s;t, uncondemn'd by her. And indeed, to &s;ecure my &s;elf on this &s;ide, I have us'd the nece&s;&s;ary Precaution, of &s;howing this Pa|per before it was publi&s;h'd to a judicious and learned Friend, a man in|defatigably zealous in the &s;ervice of the Church and State: and who&s;e Writings have highly de&s;erv'd of both. He was pleas'd to approve the body of the Di&s;cour&s;e, and I hope he is more my Friend, than to do it our of Complai&s;ance: 'Tis true he had too good a ta&s;te to like it all; and among&s;t &s;ome other faults recommended to my &s;econd view, what I have written, perhaps too boldly, on St. <HI>Athana&s;ius:</HI> which he advi&s;ed m$ wholly to omit. I am &s;en&s;ible enough that I had done more <HI>prudently</HI> to have follow'd his opinion: But then I could not have &s;atisfied m$
<PB N="5" REF="506">
&s;elf, that I had done hone&s;tly not to have written what was my own. It has always been my <HI>thought,</HI> that Heathens, who never did, nor with|out Miracle cou'd here of the Name of Chri&s;t, were yet in a po&s;&s;ibility of Salvation. Neither will it enter ea&s;ily into my belief, that before the coming of our Saviour, the whole World, excepting only the Jewi&s;h Nation, &s;hou'd lye under the inevitable nece&s;&s;ity of everla&s;ting Puni&s;h|ment, for want of that Revelation, which was confin'd to &s;o &s;mall a &s;pot of ground as that of <HI>Pale&s;tine</HI>. Among the Sons of <HI>Noah</HI> we read of one onely who was accurs'd; and if a ble&s;&s;ing in the ripene&s;s of time was re|&s;erv'd for <HI>Japhet,</HI> (of who&s;e Progeny we are,) it &s;eems unaccountable to me, why &s;o many Generations of the &s;ame Off&s;pring, as preceeded our Saviour in the Fle&s;h, &s;hou'd be all involv'd in one common condemnation, and yet that their Po&s;terity &s;hou'd be entituled to the hopes of Salvation: As if a Bill of Exclu&s;ion had pa&s;&s;ed only on the Fathers, which debarr'd not the Sons from their Succe&s;&s;ion. Or that &s;o many Ages had been <HI>de|liver'd over</HI> to Hell, and &s;o many <HI>re&s;erv'd</HI> for Heaven, and that the Devil had the fir&s;t choice, and God the next. Truly I am apt to think, that the revealed Religion which was taught by <HI>Noah</HI> to all his Sons might continue for &s;ome Ages in the whole Po&s;terity. That afterwards it was included wholly in the Family of <HI>Sem</HI> is manife&s;t: but when the Progenies of <HI>Cham</HI> and <HI>Japhet</HI> &s;warm'd into Colonies, and tho&s;e Colonies were &s;ubdivided into many others; in proce&s;s of time their De&s;cendants lost by little and little the Primitive and Purer Rites of Divine Wor|&s;hip, retaining only the notion of one Deity; to which &s;ucceeding Gene|rations added others: (for men took their Degrees in tho&s;e Ages from Conquerors to Gods.) Revelation being thus eclip&s;ed to almo&s;t all Man|kind, the light of Nature as the next in Dignity was &s;ub&s;tituted; and that is it which St. <HI>Paul</HI> concludes to be the Rule of the Heathens; and by which they are hereafter to be judg'd. If my &s;uppo&s;ition be true, then the con&s;equence which I have a&s;&s;um'd in my Poem may be al&s;o true; $amely, that Dei&s;m, or the Principles of Natural Wor&s;hip, are only the faint remnants or dying flames of reveal'd Religion in the Po&s;teri|$y of <HI>Noah</HI>. And that our Modern Philo&s;ophers, nay and &s;ome of our Philo&s;ophi&s;ing Divines have too much exalted the faculties of our Souls, when they have maintain'd that by their force mankind has been able $o find out that there is one Supreme Agent or Intellectual Being which we call God: that Prai&s;e and Prayer are his due Wor&s;hip; and the re&s;t $f tho&s;e deducements, which I am confident are the remote effects of $evelation, and unattainable by our Di&s;cour&s;e, I mean as &s;imply con&s;i|$ered, and without the benefit of Divine Illumination. So that we $ave not lifted up our &s;elves to God, by the weak Pinions of our Rea&s;on $$t he ha$ been plea&s;ed to de&s;cend to us: and what <HI>Socrates</HI> &s;aid of him, $hat <HI>Plato</HI> writ, and the re&s;t of the Heathen Philo&s;ophers of &s;everal $ations, is all no more than the Twilight of Revelation, after the Sun $word$ it was &s;et in the Race of <HI>Noah</HI>. That there is &s;omething above us, one Principle of <HI>motion,</HI> our Rea&s;on can apprehend, though it cannot
<PB N="6" REF="507">
di&s;cover what it is, by its own Virtue. And indeed it is very improba|ble, that we, who by the &s;trength of our faculties cannot enter into the knowledge of any <HI>Being,</HI> not &s;o much as of our <HI>own,</HI> &s;hould be able to find out by them, that Supreme Nature, which we cannot otherwi&s;e define, than by &s;aying it is Infinite; as if Infinite were definable, or In|finity a Subject for our narrow under&s;tanding. They who wou'd prove Religion by Rea&s;on, do but weaken the cau&s;e which they endeavour to &s;up|port: 'tis to take away the Pillar from our Faith, and to prop it only with a twig: 'tis to de&s;ign a Tower like that of <HI>Babel,</HI> which if it were po&s;&s;ible (as it is not) to reach Heaven would come to nothing by the confu&s;ion of the Workmen. For every man is Building a &s;everal way; impotently conceited of his own Model, and his own Materials&punc; Rea|&s;on is always &s;triving, and always at a lo&s;s: and of nece&s;&s;ity it mu&s;t &s;o come to pa&s;s, while 'tis exercis'd about that which is not its proper ob|ject. Let us be content at la&s;t, to know God by his own Methods; at least &s;o much of him, as he is pleas'd to reveal to us in the Sacred Scrip|tures; to apprehend them to be the Word of God, is all our Rea&s;on has to do; for all beyond it is the work of Faith, which is the Seal of Hea|ven impre&s;s'd upon our human under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>And now for what concerns the Holy Bi&s;hop <HI>Athana&s;ius,</HI> the Preface of who&s;e Creed &s;eems incon&s;i&s;tent with my opinion; which is, that Hea|thens may po&s;&s;ibly be &s;av'd; in the fir&s;t place I de&s;ire it may be con&s;ider'$ that it is the Preface only, not the Creed it &s;elf, which, (till I am bet|ter inform'd) is of too hard a dige&s;tion for my Charity. 'Tis not that I am ignorant how many &s;everal Texts of Scripture &s;eemingly &s;uppor$ that Cau&s;e: but neither am I ignorant how all tho&s;e Texts may receive a kinder, and more mollified Interpretation. Every man who is read in Church Hi&s;tory knows <HI>that</HI> Belief was drawn up after a long contestati|on with <HI>Arrius,</HI> concerning the Divinity of our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, and hi$ being one Sub&s;tance with the Father; and that thus compil'd, it was &s;ent abroad among the Chri&s;tian Churches, as a kind of Test, which who&s;o|ever took, was look'd on as an Orthodox Believer 'Tis manife&s;t from hence, that the Heathen part of the Empire was not concerned in it: for its bu&s;ine&s;s was not to di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt Pagans and Chri&s;tians, but betwixt Hereticks and true Believers. This, well con&s;ider'd, takes of the Heavy weight of Cen&s;ure, which I wou'd willingly avoid from $word$ venerable a Man; for if this Proportion, <HI>Who&s;oever will be &s;av'd,</HI> b$ re&s;trained only to tho&s;e to whom it was intended, and for whom it wa$ compo&s;ed, I mean the Chri&s;tians; then the Anathema reaches not th$ Heathens, who had never heard of Chri&s;t, and were nothing intere&s;&s;$$ in that di&s;pute. After all, I am far from blaming even that Prefator$ addition to the Creed&punc; and as far from cavelling at the continuation of it in the Liturgy of the Church; where, on the days appointed, $word$ publickly read: For, I &s;uppo&s;e, there is the &s;ame rea&s;on for it now, $word$ oppo&s;ition to the <HI>So$ini$n$,</HI> as there was then again&s;t the <HI>Arrians;</HI> th$ $word$ being a Here&s;ie which &s;eems to have been refin'd out of the other
<PB N="7" REF="508">
and with how much more plau&s;ibility of Rea&s;on it combats our Religion, with &s;o much more caution to be avoided: and therefore the prudence of our Church is to be commended, which has interpos'd her Authority for the recommendation of this Creed. Yet to &s;uch as are grounded in the true believe, tho&s;e explanatory Creeds, the <HI>Nicene</HI> and this of <HI>Athana|&s;ius</HI> might perhaps be &s;par'd: for what is &s;upernatural, will always be a My&s;tery in &s;pight of Expo&s;ition: and for my own part the plain Apo|&s;tles Creed is mo&s;t &s;uitable to my weak under&s;tanding; as the &s;imple&s;t diet $word$ the mo&s;t ea&s;ie of Dige&s;tion.</P>
<P>I have dwelt longer on this Subject than I intended; and longer than, perhaps, I ought; for having laid down, as my Foundation, that the Scripture is a Rule; that in all things needful to Salvation, it is clear, &s;ufficient, and ordain'd by God Almighty for that purpo&s;e, I have left my &s;elf no right to interpret ob&s;cure places, &s;uch as concern the po&s;&s;i|bility of eternal happine&s;s to Heathens: becau&s;e what&s;oever is ob&s;cure is concluded not nece&s;&s;ary to be known.</P>
<P>But by a&s;&s;erting the Scripture to be the Canon of our Faith, I have unavoidably created to my &s;elf two &s;orts of Enemies: The Papi&s;ts in|deed, more directly, becau&s;e they have kept the Scripture from us, what they cou'd; and have re&s;erv'd to them&s;elves a right of Interpreting what they have deliver'd under the pretence of Infallibility: and the Fana|ticks more collaterally, becau&s;e they have a&s;&s;um'd what amounts to an Infallibility, in the private Spirit: and have detorted tho&s;e Texts of Scripture, which are not nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation, to the damnable u&s;es of Sedition, di&s;turbance and de&s;truction of the Civil Government. To be|gin with the Papi&s;ts, and to &s;peak freely, I think them the le&s;s dange|rous (at lea&s;t in appearance to our pre&s;ent State) for not only the Pe|nal Laws are in Force again&s;t them, and their number is contemptible; but al&s;o their Peerage and Commons are excluded from Parliaments, and con&s;equently tho&s;e Laws in no probability of being Repeald. A General and Uninterrupted Plot of their Clergy, ever &s;ince the Reformation, I &s;uppo&s;e all Prote&s;tants believe. For 'tis not rea&s;onable to think but that &s;o many of their Orders, as were outed from their fat Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, wou'd endeavour a re-entrance again&s;t tho&s;e whom they account Hereticks. As for the late de&s;ign, Mr. <HI>Coleman's</HI> Letters, for ought I know are the be&s;t Evidence; and what they di&s;cover, without wyre-drawing their Sen&s;e, or malicious Glo&s;&s;es, all Men of rea&s;on conclude credible. If there be any thing more than this requir'd of me, I mu&s;t believe it as well as I am able, in &s;pight of the Witne&s;&s;es, and out of a decent conformity to the Votes of Parliament: For I &s;uppo&s;e the Fanaticks will not allow the private Spirit in this Ca&s;e: Here the Infallibility is at lea&s;t in one part of the Government; and our under&s;tandings as well as our wills are repre&s;ented. But to return to the Roman Catholicks, how can we be &s;e|cure from the practice of Je&s;uited Papi&s;ts in that Religion; For not two or three of that Order, as &s;ome of them would impo&s;e upon us, but a|mo&s;t the whole Body of them are of opinion, that their infallible Master
<PB N="8" REF="509">
has a right over Kings, not only in Spirituals but Temporals. Not to name <HI>Mariano. Bellarmine, Emanuel Sa, Molina, Sentaret, Simanca</HI> and at least twenty others of Foreign Countries; we can produce of our own Nation, <HI>Campian,</HI> and <HI>Doleman</HI> or <HI>Par&s;ons,</HI> be&s;ides many are nam'd whom I have not read, who all of them attest this Doctrine, that the Pope can depo&s;e and give away the Right of any Sovereign Prince, <HI>&s;$vel paulum deflexerit,</HI> if he &s;hall never &s;o little Worp: but if he once comes to be Excommunicated, then the Bond of obedience is taken off from Subjects; and they may and ought to drive him like another <HI>Nebuchad|nezzar, ex hominum Chri&s;tianorum Dominatu,</HI> from exerci&s;ing Domi|nion over Chri&s;tians: and to this they are bound by virtue of Divine Precept, and by all the tyes of Con&s;cience under no le&s;s Penalty than Damnation. If they an&s;wer me (as a Learned Prie&s;t has lately Writ|ten,) that this Doctrine of the Je&s;uites is not <HI>de fide,</HI> and that con&s;e|quently they are not oblig'd by it, they must pardon me, if I think they have &s;aid nothing to the purpo&s;e; for 'tis a Maxim in their Church&punc; where Points of Faith are not decided, and that Doctors are of contrary opinions, they may follow which part they plea&s;e: but more &s;afely the mo&s;t receiv'd and mo&s;t authoriz'd. And their Champion <HI>Bellarmine</HI> has told the World, in his Apology, that the King of <HI>England</HI> is a Va&s;&s;al to the Pope, <HI>ratione directi Domini,</HI> and that he holds in Villanage of his Roman Landlord. Which is no new claim put in for <HI>England</HI>. Our Chronicles are his Authentique Witne&s;&s;es, that, King <HI>John</HI> was depos'd by the &s;ame Plea, and <HI>Phillip Augu&s;tus</HI> admitted Tenant. And which makes the more for <HI>Bellarmine,</HI> the French King was again ejected when our King &s;ubmitted to the Church, and the Crown receiv'd under th$ &s;ordid Condition of a Va&s;&s;alage.</P>
<P>'Tis not &s;ufficient for the more moderate and well-meaning Papi&s;ts, (of which I doubt not there are many) to produce the Evidences of their Loy|alty to the late King, and to declare their Innocency in this Plot; I will grant their behaviour in the fir&s;t, to have been as Loyal and as brav$ as they de&s;ire; and will be willing to hold them excus'd as to the &s;econd&punc; (I mean when it comes to my turn, and after my betters; for 'tis a mad|ne&s;s to be &s;ober alone, while the Nation continues Drunk:) but that Sa$|ing of their Father <HI>Cre&s;.</HI> is still running in my head, that they may be di&s;pens'd with in their Obedience to an Heretick Prince, while the nece&s;|&s;ity of the times &s;hall oblige them to it: (for that (as another of them tells us,) is only the effect of Chri&s;tian Prudence) but when once they &s;hall get power to &s;hake him off, an Heretick is no lawful King, and con|&s;equently to ri&s;e again&s;t him is no Rebellion. I &s;hould be glad therefore that they wou'd follow the advice which was charitably given them $ a Reverend Prelate of our Church; namely, that they would joyn in by publick Act of di&s;owning and dete&s;ting tho&s;e Je&s;uitick Principles; an$ &s;ub&s;cribe to all Doctrines which deny the Pope's Authority of Depo&s;ing Kings, and relea&s;ing Subjects from their Oath of Allegiance: to which I &s;hould think they might ea&s;ily be induc'd, if it be true that this pre&s;e$$
<PB N="9" REF="510">
Pope has condemn'd the Doctrine of King killing (a The&s;is of the Je&s;uites) among&s;t others <HI>ex Cathedra</HI> (as they call it) or in open Con&s;i&s;tory.</P>
<P>Leaving them, therefore, in &s;o fair a way (if they plea&s;e them&s;elves) of &s;atisfying all rea&s;onable Men, of their &s;incerity and good meaning to the Government, I &s;hall make bold to con&s;ider that other extreme of our Religion, I mean the Fanaticks, or Schi&s;maticks, of the Engli&s;h Church. Since the Bible has been tran&s;lated into our Tongue, they have us'd it &s;o, as if their bu&s;ine&s;s was not to be &s;av'd, but to be damn'd by its Contents, if me con&s;ider only them, better had it been for the Engli&s;h Nation, that it had &s;till remain'd in the original Greek and Hebrew, or at lea&s;t in the hone&s;t Latin of St. <HI>Jerome,</HI> than that &s;everal Texts in it, &s;hould have been prevaricated to the de&s;truction of that Government which put it into &s;o ungrateful hands.</P>
<P>How many Here&s;ies the fir&s;t Tran&s;lation of <HI>Tyndal</HI> produce in few years, let my Lord <HI>Herbert</HI>'s Hi&s;tory of <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth inform you; In&s;omuch that for the gro&s;s errours in it, and the great mi&s;chiefs it oc|ca&s;ion'd, a Sentence pa&s;s'd on the fir&s;t Edition of the Bible, too &s;hame|ful almost to be repeated. After the &s;hort Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the Sixth (who had continued to carry on the Reformation, on other Principles than it was begun) every one knows that not only the chief Promoters of that Work, but many others, who&s;e Con&s;ciences wou'd not di&s;pence with Popery, were forc'd for fear of per&s;ecution, to change Climates: from whence returning at the beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Reign, many of them who had been in <HI>France,</HI> and at <HI>Geneva,</HI> brought back the rigid opinions and imperious di&s;cipline of <HI>Calvin,</HI> to graff upon our Reformation, which though they cunningly conceal'd at fir&s;t, (as well knowing how nau&s;eou&s;ly that Drug wou'd go down in a lawful Mo|narchy, which was pre&s;crib'd for a rebellious Common-wealth) yet they always kept it in re&s;erve; and were never wan$ing to them&s;elves either in Court or Parliament, when either they had any pro&s;pect of a nume|rous Party of Fanatick Members in the one, or the Encouragement of any Favourite in the other, who&s;e Covetou&s;ne&s;s was gaping at the Patrimo|ny of the Church. They who will con&s;ult the Works of our venerable <HI>Hooker,</HI> or the account of his Life, or more particularly the Letter writ|ten to him on his Subject, by <HI>George Cranmer,</HI> may &s;ee by what grada|tions they proceeded; from the di&s;like of Cap and Surplice, the very next step was Admonitions to the Parliament against the whole Government Eccle&s;iastical: then came out Volumes in Engli&s;h and Latin in defence of their Tenets: and immediately Practices were &s;et on foot to erect their Di&s;cipline without Authority. Tho&s;e not &s;ucceeding, Satyr and Railing was the next: And <HI>Martin Mar-Prelate</HI> (the <HI>Marvel</HI> of tho&s;e times) was the first Presbyterian Scribler, who &s;anctify'd Libels and Scurrility to the u&s;e of the Good Old Cau&s;e. Which was done (&s;ay's my Author) upon this account; that (their &s;erious Treati&s;es having been fully an&s;wered and refuted) they might compa&s;s by railing what they had lost by rea&s;on|ing; and when their Cau&s;e was &s;unk in Court and Parliament, they
<PB N="10" REF="511">
might at lea&s;t hedge in a &s;take among&s;t the Rabble: for to their igno|rance all things are Wit which are abu&s;ive; but if Church and State were made the Theme, then the Doctoral Degree of Wit was to be taken at <HI>Billing&s;gate:</HI> even the Mo&s;t Saint-like of the Party, though they dur&s;t not excu&s;e this contempt and villyfying of the Government, yet were pleas'd, and grin'd at it with a pious &s;mile; and call'd it a judgment of God again&s;t the Hierarchy. Thus Sectaries, we may &s;ee, were born with teeth, foul mouth'd and &s;currilous from their infancy: and if Spi|ritual Pride, Venome, Violence. Contempt of Superiours and Slander had been the marks of Orthodox Belief; the Presbytery and the re&s;t of our Schi&s;maticks, which are their Spawn, were always the Most vi&s;ible Church in the Chri&s;tian World.</P>
<P>'Tis true, the Government was too &s;trong at that time for a Rebelli|on; but to &s;hew what proficiency they had made in <HI>Calvin</HI>'s School, even <HI>Then</HI> their mouth's water'd at it: for two of their gifted Brotherhood (<HI>Hacket</HI> and <HI>Coppinger</HI>) as the Story tells us, got up into a Pea&s;e-Cart, and harangued the People, to di&s;po&s;e them to an In&s;urrection, and to establi&s;h the Di&s;cipline by force: &s;o that however it comes about, that now they celebrate Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Birth-night, as that of their Saint and Patrone&s;s; yet then they were for doing the work of the Lord by Arms again&s;t her; and in all probability, they wanted but a Fana|tique Lord Mayor and two Sheriffs of their Party to have compa&s;s'd it.</P>
<P>Our venerable <HI>Hooker,</HI> after many Admonitions which he had given them, toward the end of his Preface, breaks out into this Prophetick Speech, <Q>&startq;<HI>There is in every one of the&s;e Con&s;iderations mo&s;t ju&s;t cau&s;e to f$ar, le&s;t our ha&s;tine&s;s to embrace a thing of &s;o perilous con&s;e|quence</HI> (meaning the Presbyterian Di&s;cipline) <HI>&s;hould cau&s;e Po&s;teri|ty to feel tho&s;e Evils, which as yet are more ea&s;ie for us to prevent $endq;than they would be for them to remedy</HI>.</Q></P>
<P>How fatally this <HI>Ca&s;&s;andra</HI> has foretold we know too well by &s;ad ex|perience: the Seeds were &s;own in the time of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> the bloody Harve&s;t ripened in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Martyr: and becau&s;e all the Sheaves could not be carried off without &s;hedding &s;ome of the loo&s;e Grains, another Crop is too like to follow; nay I fear 'tis unavoidable, if the Conventiclers be permitted &s;till to &s;catter.</P>
<P>A man may be &s;uffer'd to quote an Adver&s;ary to our Religion, when he &s;peaks Truth: and 'tis the ob&s;ervation of <HI>Melmbourgh</HI> in his Hi&s;to|ry of Calvini&s;m, that where-ever this Di&s;cipline was planted and em|brac'd, Rebellion, Civil-War and Mi&s;ery attended it. And how in|deed &s;hould it happen otherwi&s;e? Reformation of Church and State has always been the ground of our Divi&s;ions in <HI>England</HI>. While we are Papi&s;ts, our Holy Father rid us, by pretending authority out of the Scriptures to depo&s;e Princes, when we &s;hook off his Authority, the $ect$|ries furni&s;h'd them&s;elves with the &s;ame Weapons; and out of the &s;ame Magazine, the Bible. So that the Scriptures, which are in them&s;elves the greate&s;t $word$ of Governours, as Commanding $span$
<PB N="11" REF="512">
them, are now turn'd to their de&s;truction; and never &s;ince the Refor|mation, has there wanted a Text of their interpreting to Authorize a Rebel. And 'tis to be noted by the way, that the Doctrines of King kil|ling and Depo&s;ing, which have been taken up only by the wor&s;t Party of the Papi&s;ts, the most frontle&s;s Flatterers of the Pope's Authority, have been e&s;pous'd, defended and are &s;till maintain'd by the whole body of Non-conformists and Republicans. 'Tis but dubbing them&s;elves the People of God, which 'tis the Interest of their Preachers to tell them they are and their own Intere&s;t to believe; and after that, they cannot dip into the Bible, but one Text or another will turn up for their purpo&s;e: If they are under Per&s;ecution (as they call it,) then that is a mark of their Election; of their flouri&s;h, then God works Miracles for their Deliverance, and the Saints are to po&s;&s;e&s;s the Earth.</P>
<P>They may think them&s;elves to be too roughly handled in this Paper; but I who know best how far I could have gone on this Subject, must be hold to tell them they are &s;par'd: though at the &s;ame time I am not Ig|norant that they interpret the mildne&s;s of a Writer to them, as they do the mercy of the Government; in the one they think it Fear, and con|clude it Weakne&s;s in the other. The best way for them to confute me, $word$, as I before advis'd the Papists, to di&s;claim their Principles, and re|nounce their Practices. We &s;hall all be glad to think them true Engli&s;h|men when they obey the King, and true Prote&s;tants when they conform to the Church Di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>It remains that I acquaint the Reader, that the Ver&s;es were written for an ingenious young Gentleman, my Friend; upon his Tran&s;lation of <HI>The Critical Hi&s;tory of the Old Te&s;tament,</HI> compos'd by the learned Fa|ther <HI>Simon:</HI> The Ver&s;es therefore are addre&s;&s;ed to the Tran&s;lator of that Work, and the &s;tyle of them is, what it ought to be, Epi&s;tolary.</P>
<P>If any one be &s;o lamentable a Critick as to require the Smoothne&s;s, the Numbers and the Turn of Heroick Poetry of this Poem, I mu&s;t tell him, that if he has not read <HI>Horace,</HI> I have &s;tudied him, and hope the &s;tyle of his Epi&s;tles is not ill imitated here. The Expre&s;&s;ions of a Poem, de&s;ign'd purely for in&s;truction, ought to be Plain and Natural, and yet Maje&s;tick: for here the Poet is pre&s;um'd to be a kind of Law giver, and tho&s;e three qualities which I have nam'd are proper to the Legi&s;lative &s;tyle. The Horid, Elevated and Figurative way is for the Pa&s;&s;ions; for Love and Hatred, Fear and Anger, are begotten in the Soul by &s;hewing their Ob|jects out of their true proportion, either greater than the Life, or le&s;s; but in&s;truction i$ to be given by &s;hewing them what they naturally are. A Man is to be cheated into Pa&s;&s;ion, but to be rea&s;on'd into Truth.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is &s;trange to think, in an Age &s;o addicted to the <HI>Mu&s;es,</HI> how <HI>Pa&s;toral Poetry</HI> comes to be never &s;o much as thought upon; con&s;idering e&s;pecially, that it has always been accounted the most con&s;iderable of the &s;maller Poems: <HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Spencer</HI> made $&s;e of it as a Prelude to <HI>Heroick Poetry</HI>. But I fear the Innocency of the Subject makes it &s;o little inviting at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>There is no &s;ort of Poetry, if well wrought, but gives Delight. And the <HI>Pa&s;toral</HI> perhaps may boa&s;t of this in a peculiar manner. For, as in Painting, &s;o I believe, in Poetry, the Country affords the mo&s;t entertaining Scenes, and mo&s;t delightful Pro&s;pects.</P>
<P><HI>Ga&s;&s;endus,</HI> I remember, tells us, That <HI>Peireskius</HI> was a great Lover of Mu&s;ick, e&s;pecially that of Birds; becau&s;e their Artle&s;s Strains &s;eem to have le&s;s of Pa&s;&s;ion and Vio|lence, but more of a natural Ea&s;ine&s;s, and therefore do the rather befriend Contemplation. It is after the &s;ame manner that <HI>Pa&s;toral</HI> gives a &s;weet and gentle Compo&s;ure to the Mind; whereas the <HI>Epick</HI> and <HI>Tragick</HI> Poems put the Spirits in too great a Ferment by the Vehemence of their Motions.</P>
<P>To &s;ee a &s;$ately, well built Palace &s;trikes us, indeed, with Admiration, and &s;wells the Soul, as it were, with Notions of Grandeur. But when I view a little Country Dwelling, advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated amid&s;t a beautiful Va|riety of Fields, Woods, and Rivers, I feel an un&s;peakable kind of Satisfaction, and cannot forbear wi&s;hing, that my good Fortune would place me in &s;o &s;weet a Retirement.</P>
<P><HI>Theocritus, Virgil,</HI> and <HI>Spencer,</HI> are the only Writers that &s;eeem to have hit upon the true Nature of <HI>Pa&s;toral</HI> Po$ems. So that it will be Honour &s;ufficient for me, if I hav$ not altogether fail'd in my Attempt.</P>
