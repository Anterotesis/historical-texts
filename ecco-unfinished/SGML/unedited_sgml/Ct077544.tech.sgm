<HEAD>TO THE

Lord BISHOP of Lichfield.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_YOUR Fame for that celebrated
Book, call'd the <HI>Defence of
Chri&s;tianity,</HI> is the Occa&s;ion of
this Dedication. I need not tell you,
what va&s;t Reputation you have ac|quired
by it: You have been not only
often applauded from the Pre&s;s, but
have met with large Compliments and
Thanks from your Clergy for it. And
tho' Mr. <HI>Scheme</HI> has very untowardly
written again&s;t you, yet this is <HI>&s;till</HI>
your Honour, that you are an <HI>Author,</HI>
not unworthy of his Regard and Notice.</P>
<P>I am, in Opinion with the Fathers,
again&s;t an e&s;tabli&s;h'd Hire for the
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
Prie&s;thood, thinking it of di&s;&s;ervice to
true Religion: But when I con&s;ider'd
the U&s;efulne&s;s of your Lord&s;hip's Epi&s;|copal
Riches and Honours to this Con|trover&s;y,
I almo&s;t chang'd my Mind.
Your exalted Station in the Church,
has given Credit and Authority to your
Work, which, if it had came from the
Hands of a poor Prie&s;t, had never been
&s;o much admir'd; neither would Mr.
<HI>Scheme,</HI> I believe, nor my &s;elf, have paid
&s;o many Re&s;pects to it.</P>
<P>For this Rea&s;on, I wi&s;h &s;ome more
of your <HI>Order</HI> would appear in this Con|trover&s;y,
that the World might &s;ee what
famous Men are our <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> and of
what U&s;e their <HI>Hundreds</HI> and <HI>Thou&s;ands</HI>
a Year are to the Dafence of Chri|&s;tianity;
which, if &s;uch able Hands were
not amply hired to its Support, might
be in Danger, as certainly as, that Men
of low Fortunes mu&s;t needs be Men of
poor Parts, little Learning, and &s;lender
Capacities to write in Vindication of it.</P>
<P>Some have conceiv'd Hopes that the
great <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> from his la&s;t
<PB N="v" REF="4">
Charge to his <HI>Clergy,</HI> will &s;econd you
in this Controver&s;y; if &s;o, there's no
doubt on't, but his Performance will be
commen&s;urate to his State and Revenues.
Of his Zeal in the Controver&s;y, he has
already given a notable In&s;tance, when
he pro&s;ecuted the <HI>Moderator;</HI> and I
dare &s;ay, he'll vouch&s;afe us a more re|markable
Specimen of his Knowledge
in it, as &s;oon as he can &s;pare Time for't;
and then (Oh my Fears!) he'll pay me
off for my Objection again&s;t Chri&s;t's
Re&s;urrection, which he would have
per&s;uaded the Civil Magi&s;trate to have
done for him.</P>
<P>But whether the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> of <HI>London</HI>
&s;econds you or not, it's Time, <HI>my Lord,</HI>
to expect another Volume from you, in
An&s;wer to Mr. <HI>Scheme,</HI> which, for all
the Reports that are &s;pread of your in|tended
Silence, I hope &s;oon to &s;ee pub|li&s;h'd.
What will the People &s;ay, if that
<HI>Phili&s;thin</HI> goes off, giving you the la&s;t
Blow in the Controver&s;y? Nothing le&s;s
than that he has gotten the better of the
Learned <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> of <HI>Lichfield,</HI> and has re|futed
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
Chri&s;tianity to the Conviction of
the Bi&s;hop him&s;elf, who would renounce
it too, but for the temporal Advantages
he enjoys by it.</P>
<P>Think, <HI>my Lord,</HI> on the Di&s;honour
of &s;uch Reflections, and re&s;ume Courage
again&s;t the Adver&s;ary. I look upon you
as a more &s;turdy Gladiator than for one
Cut on the Pate, to quit the Stage of
Battle. Tho' Mr. <HI>Scheme</HI> has unluckily
hit you on a &s;oft Place, and weaken'd
your Intellectuals for a while; yet he is a
generous Combatant, and gives you
Time to recover your wonted Strength
of Rea&s;on. At him again then, <HI>my Lord,</HI>
and fear not, in your Turn, to give him
&s;uch a Home-Thru&s;t, as will pierce his
unbelieving Heart.</P>
<P>And when your <HI>Lord&s;hip</HI> engages him
again from the <HI>Pre&s;s,</HI> I hope you'll be
more explicite for Liberty of Debate.
Through godly Zeal for <HI>Church,</HI> you un|happily
made a Slip, in your <HI>Dedication</HI> to
the <HI>King,</HI> on the per&s;ecuting Side of the
Question, which had lik'd to have &s;ully'd
the Glory of your whole Work. Such a
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
grand Philo&s;opher, as you are, &s;hould
tru&s;t alone to the Goodne&s;s of your
Cau&s;e, and the Strength of your Rea&s;on|ings,
in Defence of it: Such a potent
Champion for Chri&s;tianity, as you are,
&s;hould di&s;dain the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of any, but
of God, to fight for you. The U&s;e of
the Civil Sword on your Side, is not only
a Di&s;paragement to your Parts, but a
Di&s;grace to our Religion.</P>
<P>I know not what your <HI>Lord&s;hip</HI> may
think on't, but the Pro&s;ecution of the
<HI>Moderator</HI> was, in the Judgment of others,
more than of my &s;elf, &s;ome Reproach to
you: Becau&s;e of a few &s;lender Animad|ver&s;ions,
I made on your renown'd Book,
&s;ome think I &s;uffer'd a Pro&s;ecution, which
you, in Honour, &s;hould have di&s;courag'd.
I am willing to acquit you as much as
may be; and would, if I could, impute
it to your Forgetfulne&s;s, rather than your
Malice, that you &s;tep'd not between me
and Danger.</P>
<P>Whether this Di&s;cour&s;e will be accept|able
to your Lord&s;hip, is &s;omewhat un|certain;
I am afraid it will be a little
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
di&s;gu&s;tful to your nice and delicate Ta&s;te
in Theology, which reli&s;hes nothing better
than the plain and ordinary Food of the
Letter of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Miracles: But however,
you will readily interpret this <HI>Dedication</HI>
to your Honour, and if you &s;hould make
me a large pre&s;ent of Gold for it, I &s;in|cerely
a&s;&s;ure your <HI>Lord&s;hip,</HI> it will be
more than I aim'd at; neither do I de&s;ire
any other Return for it, than to be en|dulg'd
the Liberty and Plea&s;ure to pay
my cu&s;tomary Re&s;pects to your Writ|ings;
and upon proper Occa&s;ions to te&s;ti|fy
to the World, how much I am,</P>

<HEAD>A SECOND
DISCOURSE
ON THE
MIRACLES
OF OUR
SAVIOUR, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_I HERE publi&s;h another <HI>Di&s;|cour&s;e</HI>
on our Saviour's Mira|cles,
which I am not only
oblig'd to, by the Promi&s;e I
made in my former; but am encouraged to
it by the Reception which <HI>that</HI> m$t with.
If any of our <HI>Clergy</HI> were, and $e$$des
them, few or none could be offended at
my former <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e,</HI> they &s;hould have
printed their Exceptions to it, and, if po&s;|&s;ible,
<PB N="2" REF="9">
their Confutation of it, which might
perhaps have prevented me the giving
them any more Trouble of this Kind.</P>
<P>In my former <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e</HI> I fairly declar'd,
that if the <HI>Clergy</HI> could di&s;prove my Argu|ments
again&s;t the <HI>Letter,</HI> and for the <HI>Spirit</HI>
of the Miracles I there took to task, I would
not only de&s;i&s;t from the Pro&s;ecution of my
De&s;ign, but own my &s;elf an impious <HI>Infidel</HI>
and <HI>Bla&s;phemer,</HI> and de&s;erving of the
wor&s;t Puni&s;hment: But &s;ince they are all
mute and &s;ilent, even in this Cau&s;e, which
in Honour and Intere&s;t they &s;hould have
&s;poken out to, they ought not to be an|gry,
if I proceed in it. I have given
them time enough to make a Reply, if
they had been of Ability to do it: What
mu&s;t I think then upon their Silence? No|thing
le&s;s than that my Cau&s;e is impreg|nable,
and my Arguments and Authorities
in Defence of it irrefragable; and though
they don't profe&s;&s;edly yield to the Force of
them; yet they have nothing to &s;ay in A|batement
of their Strength, or it had cer|tainly
&s;een the Light before now.</P>
<P>I go on then in my undertaking to write
again&s;t the literal Story of our Saviour's
Miracles, and again&s;t the U&s;e that is
commonly made of them to prove his di|vine
Authority and Me&s;&s;ia&s;hip: And this
I do, I &s;olemnly again declare it, not for
<PB N="3" REF="10">
the Service of Infidelity, but for the Ho|nour
of the Holy Je&s;us, and to reduce the
<HI>Clergy</HI> to the good <HI>old Way,</HI> and the <HI>only
Way</HI> of proving his Me&s;&s;ia&s;hip, and that
is, by the allegorical Interpretation of the
Law and the Prophets. Therefore, with|out
any more Preamble, I re&s;ume again
the Con&s;ideration of the three Heads of
Di&s;cour&s;e, before propo&s;ed to be treated
on to this Purpo&s;e. And they are,</P>
<P>I. To &s;hew, That the Miracles of heal|ing
all manner of Bodily Di&s;ea&s;es, which
<HI>Je&s;us</HI> was ju&s;tly fam'd for, are none of
the proper Miracles of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> nei|ther
are they &s;o much as a good Proof
of his divine Authority to found a Reli|gion.</P>
<P>II. That the literal Hi&s;tory of many of
the Miracles of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> as recorded by the
<HI>Evangeli&s;ts,</HI> does imply Ab&s;urdities, Im|probabilities,
and Incredibilities; con&s;e|quently
they, either in whole or in part,
were never wrought, as they are common|ly
believed now-a-days, but are only re|lated
as prophetical and parabolical Narra|tives
of what would be my&s;teriou&s;ly, and
more wonderfully done by him.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="11">
III. To con&s;ider, what <HI>Je&s;us</HI> means,
when he appea$s to his Miracles, as to a
Te&s;timony and Witne&s;s of his divine Au|thority;
and to &s;hew that he could not
prop$$ly and ultimately refer to tho&s;e, he
then wrought in the <HI>Fle&s;h,</HI> but to tho&s;e
my&s;tical ones, which he would do in the
<HI>Spirit,</HI> of which tho&s;e wrought in the
Fle&s;h are but mere Types and Shadows.</P>
<P>I have already &s;poken, what I then
thought &s;ufficient to the fir&s;t of the&s;e
Heads; and though I could now much en|large
my Rea&s;ons, and multiply Authori|ties
upon it to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e; yet I
&s;hall not do it; but only, by Way of
Introduction to my following <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e,</HI>
&s;ay, that if it had been intended by our
Saviour, that any rational Argument for
his divine Authority and <HI>Me&s;&s;ia&s;hip</HI> &s;hould
be urged from his miraculous healing
Power; the Di&s;ea&s;es which he cured,
would have been accurately de&s;cribed, and
his Manner of Operation &s;o cautiou&s;ly ex|pre&s;s'd,
as that we might have been &s;ure
the Work was &s;upernatural, and out of
the Power of Art and Nature to perform:
But the <HI>Evangeli&s;ts</HI> have taken no &s;uch
Care in their Narrations of Chri&s;t's Mira|cles.
As for In&s;tance, <HI>Je&s;us</HI> is &s;uppo&s;ed
<PB N="5" REF="12">
often miraculou&s;ly to cure <HI>Lamene&s;s;</HI> but
there is no Account of the nature and de|gree
of Lamene&s;s he cured; nor are we
certain, whether the Skill of a <HI>Surgeon,</HI>
or Nature it &s;elf, could not have done the
Work without his Help. If the <HI>Evange|li&s;ts</HI>
had told us of Men, that wanted
one or both their Legs, (and &s;uch mi&s;e|rable
Objects of Chri&s;t's Power and Com|pa&s;&s;ion,
were undoubtedly in tho&s;e Days
as well as in ours) and how <HI>Je&s;us</HI> com|manded
Nature to extend it&s;elf to the en|tire
Reparation of &s;uch Defects; here
would have been &s;tupendous Miracles in|deed,
which no Sceptici&s;m, nor Infidelity
it&s;elf could have cavill'd at; nor could I,
nor the Fathers them&s;elves have told how
to allegorize, and make Parables of them.
But there is no <HI>&s;uch</HI> Miracle recorded of
Chri&s;t, nor any thing equal to it; &s;o far
from it, that the be&s;t and greate&s;t Miracles
of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> which mu&s;t confe&s;&s;edly be tho&s;e
related at large, (for no Body can &s;uppo&s;e
he did greater than tho&s;e more particularly
&s;pecify'd) are liable to exception, being &s;o
blindly, and lamely, and imperfectly re|ported,
as that, by Rea&s;onings upon the
Letter of the Stories of them, they may
be dwindled away, and reduced to no
Wonders, which brings me to treat again
$word$ the</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="13">
II. Second Head of my Di&s;cour&s;e, and
that is, to &s;hew, that the literal Hi&s;tory
of the Miracles of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> as recorded in
the <HI>Evangeli&s;ts,</HI> does imply Ab&s;urdities,
Improbabilities and Incredibilities; con&s;e|quently
they, in whole or in part, were
never wrought, but are only related as pa|rabolical
Narratives of what would be my|&s;teriou&s;ly,
and more wonderfully done by
him.</P>
<P>To this Purpo&s;e I, in my former Di&s;|cour&s;e,
took into Examination <HI>three</HI> of the
Miracles of Je&s;us, <HI>viz.</HI> tho&s;e, of <HI>his driv|ing
the Buyers and Sellers out of the Tem|ple;</HI>
Of <HI>his exorci&s;ing the Devils out of
the Madmen, and &s;ending them into the
Herd of Swine;</HI> and <HI>Of his Transfigu|ration
on the Mount.</HI> How well I per|form'd
on the&s;e Miracles, which have been
admired for their literal Story, let others
judge and &s;ay.</P>
<P><HI>I now will take into Con&s;ideration
three others of</HI> Je&s;us'<HI>s Miracles,</HI> viz.
<HI>tho&s;e, Of</HI> his healing a Woman that was
afflicted with an I&s;&s;ue of Blood, twelve
Years; <HI>Of</HI> his curing the Woman that
labour'd under a Spirit of Infirmity, eigh|teen
Years; <HI>and Of</HI> his telling the <HI>Sama|ritan</HI>
Woman her Fortune of having had
five Husbands, and living then in Adul|tery
<PB N="7" REF="14">
with another Man: <HI>Which are, all
three, reputedly mo&s;t miraculous and ad|mired
Stories. The two former, they &s;ay,
are Arguments of</HI> Je&s;us'<HI>s mighty Power;
and the latter, of his immen&s;e Knowledge:
But how little of certain Power and
Knowledge there is in any of them, ac|cording
to the Letter, will be &s;een in
the &s;equel of this Di&s;cour&s;e. Infidels, I
dare &s;ay, if they had not wanted Liberty,
would e'er now have facetiou&s;ly expo&s;ed
tho&s;e Stories. If I &s;natch that Work out
of their Hands, our</HI> Clergy <HI>ought to be
glad, becau&s;e what I do in it, is to the
Honour of the Holy</HI> Je&s;us, <HI>and to turn
tho&s;e pretendedly miraculous Stories into
divine My&s;teries.</HI></P>
<P>In my former Di&s;cour&s;e I gave my <HI>Rea|ders</HI>
&s;ome Rea&s;on to expect, that in <HI>this</HI>
I would treat on &s;ome of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Miracles,
which I there mentioned, <HI>viz. On his turn|ing
Water into Wine at a Marriage in</HI>
Cana <HI>of</HI> Galilee; and <HI>On his feeding of
Thou&s;ands with a few Loaves and Fi&s;hes
in the Wilderne&s;s;</HI> and <HI>On his Cure of
the Paralytick, for whom the Roof of
the Hou&s;e was broken up to let him down
into the Room where</HI> Je&s;us <HI>was,</HI> &amp;c. And
I then really did de&s;ign to &s;peak to the&s;e
Miracles, but upon Con&s;ideration, find|ing
them mo&s;t ludicrous Subjects according
<PB N="8" REF="15">
to the Letter, I forbear it at pre&s;ent, hav|ing
no Inclination to put the <HI>Clergy</HI> quite
out of all Temper. If any &s;hould &s;ay,
this is Fear and Cowardice in me, I can't
help it: But, for all that, now I have the
<HI>Clergy</HI> in a tolerable good Humour for
Liberty, I'll endeavour to keep them in
it, and not di&s;turb them by an ha&s;ty and
unnece&s;&s;ary Provocation of them. Who
knows not, that the <HI>Clergy,</HI> like an un|tamed
<HI>Colt,</HI> that I have a mind to ride, may
be apt to winch and kick, and may give
me a Fall before I come at the end of my
Journey, to the Di&s;appointment of my
Readers? They &s;hall therefore be gently
handled and &s;troak'd, till they are a little
more inur'd to the Bit and Saddle: And
for their Sakes will I po&s;tpone &s;uch Mira|cles
as are mo&s;t obnoxious to Ridicule,
and at pre&s;ent chu&s;e the afore&s;aid <HI>t$$$e,</HI>
that of almo&s;t any in the Go&s;pel may be
mo&s;t inoffen&s;ively treated on. I begin
then,</P>
<P>1. To &s;peak to that Miracle of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s
<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Matt. Ch. <HI>ix.</HI> Luke Ch. <HI>viii.</HI> Mark Ch. <HI>v.</HI></NOTE> healing a <HI>Woman di&s;ea&s;ed with an I&s;|&s;ue
of Blood, twelve Years.</HI> To plea&s;e
our <HI>Divines,</HI> I will allow as much of the
Truth of the Letter of this Story, as they
<PB N="9" REF="16">
can de&s;ire. The Fathers them&s;elves, who
are for turning the whole Hi&s;tory of <HI>Je|&s;us</HI>'s
Life into Allegory and My&s;tery,
don't deny that a Woman was cured of an
<HI>Haemorrhage,</HI> after the Manner that is
here de&s;cribed by the Evangeli&s;ts. St. <HI>Au|gu&s;tin</HI>
&s;ays<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Factum quidum e&s;t, &amp;, ita ut n$rratur, $$$$tum. <HI>In Serm.</HI> Ixxvii. <HI>Sect.</HI> $.</NOTE> of this Miracle, <HI>that it
was done, as it is related;</HI> and I have
a greater Veneration for his Authority,
than to gain&s;ay it. But for all that,
<HI>Infidels</HI> may and will take into Examina|tion
the nature of this Miracle, and if
po&s;&s;ible make little or nothing of it. And
if I do this for them, it is not to do Ser|vice
to Infidelity, but to turn Mens Heads
to the my&s;tical U&s;e of it, for which it is
recorded.</P>
<P>As there is a particular Narration of
this Miracle, among the few others, that
are &s;pecified; &s;o Rea&s;on &s;hould tell us,
that if the Letter of the Story of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s
Miracles, as our <HI>Divines</HI> hold, is only to
be regarded, this is one of the greate&s;t
that Je&s;us wrought, or it would not be
related by it&s;elf, but thrown into the
$ump of all manner of Di&s;ea&s;es, which
He heal'd. And how then &s;hall we
come to the Knowledge of the greatne&s;s
<PB N="10" REF="17">
of this Miracle? Why, there are but two
Ways to it, and they are,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> By con&s;idering the nature of the
Di&s;ea&s;e, or the lamentable Condition $word$
the Patient before Cure. And</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> By con&s;idering the Manner or
Means by which the Cure was performed.</P>
<P>If one or both of the&s;e Con&s;iderations
don't manife&s;t the Certainty of a Miracle,
<HI>Infidels</HI> may conclude there was none
in it.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> As to the nature of the Di&s;ea&s;e
of this Woman, we are much in the Dark
about it, and very uncertain of what Kind
and Degree it was. St. <HI>Matthew</HI> writing
of it, &s;ays the Woman was <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, that
is, <HI>obnoxious to bleeding;</HI> St. <HI>Mark</HI> and
St. <HI>Luke</HI> &s;ay of her, that <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">,
&s;he was in an efflux or running of
Blood. But neither one nor the other of the
<HI>Evangeli&s;ts</HI> &s;ignify of what Degree her
<HI>Haemorrhage</HI> was, nor from what part of
her Body it proceeded, nor how often or
&s;eldom &s;he was addicted to it. It might be,
for ought we know, only a little bleeding
at the No&s;e, that now and then &s;he was
&s;ubject to: Or it might be an obnoxiou&s;|ne&s;s
<PB N="11" REF="18">
to an Evacuation of Blood by Siege
or Urine: Or it was, not improbably, of
the men&s;truous Kind. Any of the&s;e might
be the Ca&s;e of this Woman for what's
written; and I don't find that any of our
<HI>Divines</HI> have determined of what &s;ort it
was. But a great Miracle is wrought,
$$ey think, in her Cure, without know|ing

could not be, nor was it po&s;&s;ible, as I
&s;uppo&s;e <HI>Phy&s;icians</HI> will agree, for Nature
to endure it &s;o long, or the Woman to
live twelve Days, much le&s;s twelve Years
under it.</P>

No more then, than &s;ome &s;light Indi&s;|po&s;ition
can rea&s;onably and naturally be
made of this Woman's Di&s;temper. And
it would be well, if Infidels would re&s;t
here with their Objections again&s;t it. But
what if they &s;hould &s;ay, that this <HI>Hae|morrhage</HI>
was rather of Advantage to the
Health of the Patient, than of Danger to
her, and that the Woman was more <HI>nice</HI>
than <HI>wi&s;e,</HI> or &s;he would never have &s;ought
&s;o much for Help and Cure of it? Some
<HI>Haemorrhages</HI> are better kept open than
&s;top'd and dry'd up; and if <HI>Infidels</HI> &s;hould
&s;ay, that <HI>this</HI> was a Pre&s;ervative of the
Life of the Woman, like an <HI>I&s;&s;ue,</HI> at which
Nature di&s;charges it&s;elf of bad Humours,
Who can contradict them? Nay, if they
&s;hould &s;ay $word$ <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Cure of this Wo|man's
<HI>Haemorrhage</HI> was a Precipitation of
her Death, for &s;he died &s;ome time after it,
rather than a Prolongation of her Life,
for &s;he lived twelve Years under it, and
was of good Strength, when &s;he applied
to our Saviour for Cure, or &s;he could ne|ver
have born the pre&s;s of the People to
come at him; Who can gain&s;ay them?
It is true &s;he was very &s;ollicitous for a
Cure, and unea&s;y under her Di&s;temper,
or &s;he would never have &s;pent all &s;he had
on <HI>Phy&s;icians;</HI> which is a Sign, &s;ome
may &s;ay, that her Di&s;ea&s;e was grievous,
<PB N="13" REF="20">
irk&s;ome, and dangerous, as well as in|cura$$e
by Art. But <HI>Infidels</HI> will &s;ay,
not $word$&punc; $or there are &s;ome &s;light cutane|ous
Di&s;tempers, &s;ometimes i&s;&s;uing with
a little purulent and bloody Matter,
that nice Women will be at a great
$$$$$ce for Relief, and are always tam|p$$$$$$
and often advi&s;ing about them,
though to no Purpo&s;e: And if they
&s;hould &s;ay that this was the wor&s;t of the
Ca&s;e of this Woman, Who can di&s;prove
it?</P>
<P>In &s;hort then here is an uncertain Di|&s;temper
both in Nature and Degree; how
then can there be any Certainty of a Mi|racle
in the Cure of it? Mr. <HI>Moore,</HI> the
<HI>Apothecary,</HI> accurately de&s;cribes the Di|&s;ea&s;es
he pretends to have cured; and he
is in the right on't &s;o to do, or he could
not recommend his Art, and aggrandize
his own Fame. So the Bodily Di&s;ea&s;e of
this Woman &s;hould have been clearly and
fully repre&s;ented to our Under&s;tanding, or
we can &s;orm no Conception of Chri&s;t's
Power in the Cure of it. And I can't
but think that the <HI>Evangeli&s;ts,</HI> e&s;pecially
St. <HI>Luke</HI> the <HI>Phy&s;ician,</HI> had made a better
Story of this Woman's Ca&s;e, if Chri&s;t's
Authority and Power had been to be urg$d
from the Letter of it. It's enough to make
us think, Chri&s;t cured no extraordinary and
<PB N="14" REF="21">
grievous Maladies, or the <HI>Evangeli&s;ts</HI>
would never have in&s;tanced in this, that
&s;o much Exception is to be made to. As
then, rea&s;onably &s;peaking, there was no
extraordinary Di&s;ea&s;e in this Woman cured,
and con&s;equently no great Miracle wrought;
&s;o let us now,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Con&s;ider the Manner of the
Cure, and whether any Miracle is to be
thence proved. <HI>The Woman &s;aid with|in
her &s;elf,</HI><NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Matt. Ch. <HI>ix.</HI> v. 21.</NOTE> <HI>that if &s;he could but touch
the Hem of Je&s;us's Garment, &s;he &s;hould
be made whole.</HI> And I can't but com|mend
her, at this di&s;tance of Time, for
the Power of her Faith, Per&s;ua&s;ion, or
Imagination in the Ca&s;e, which was a
good Preparative for Relief, and without
which, it's certain, &s;he had continued
under her Di&s;ea&s;e. The Power of Imagi|nation,
it's well known, will work Won|ders,
&s;ee Vi&s;ions, produce Mon&s;ters, and
heal Di&s;ea&s;es, as Experience and Hi&s;tory
doth te&s;tify. There being many In|&s;tances
to be given of Cures performed
by frivolous Applications, Charms, and
Spells, which are unaccountable any other
Way, than by the Imagination of the Pa|tient.
Again&s;t the Rea&s;on and Judgment
<PB N="15" REF="22">
of a <HI>Phy&s;ician,</HI> &s;ometimes the di&s;ea&s;ed
will take his own Medicines and find Be|nefit.
And I don't doubt, but Stories
may be told of Cures wrought, the Ima|gination
of the Patient helping, by as mean
a Trifle, as the Touch of Chri&s;t's Gar|ments,
and no Miracle talk'd on for it.
Even in the ordinary, natural, and ratio|nal
U&s;e of Phy&s;ick, it is requi&s;ite, that
the Patient have a good Opinion of his
<HI>Phy&s;ician</HI> and of his Medicines. A good
Heart in the Sick, tends not only to his
Support, but helps the Operation of Pre|&s;criptions.
As de&s;pair an dejection of
Mind &s;ometimes kills, where otherwi&s;e
rea&s;onably &s;peaking, proper Medicines
would cure; &s;o a good Conceit in the Pa|tient
at other times, whether the Medi|cines
be pertinent or not, is almo&s;t all
in all. And if Infidels &s;hould &s;ay that
this was the Ca&s;e of this Woman in the
Go&s;pel; if they &s;hould &s;ay as St. <HI>John of
Jeru&s;alem</HI><NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Non autem Fimbria J$&s;u, &s;ed ejus Cogitatio $am &s;alvam fecit. <HI>In Loc. Marci.</HI></NOTE> did, <HI>that her own Imagi|nation
cured her&s;elf;</HI> and &s;hould urge the
Probability of it, becau&s;e <HI>Je&s;us</HI> could do
no Cures and<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Matt. Ch. <HI>xiii.</HI> v. 58.</NOTE> Miracles again&s;t Un|belief,
Who can help it? In this Ca&s;e our
<HI>Divines</HI> mu&s;t prove, that this Woman's
<PB N="16" REF="23">
<HI>Haemorrhage</HI> was of that kind, that no
Faith nor Fancy in her&s;elf could help her
without the Divine Power; but this is impo&s;|&s;$ble
for them to do, unle&s;s there had been
a more certain De&s;cription of her Di&s;ea&s;e,
than the <HI>Evangeli&s;ts</HI> have given of it.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Divines</HI> will indeed tell us, what
I believe, that it was the Divine Power
co-operating with the Faith and Imagina|tion
of the Woman that cured her; be|cau&s;e
Je&s;us &s;ays <HI>that Virtue had gone out
of him</HI> to the healing of her: And I wi&s;h
<HI>Infidels</HI> would acquie&s;ce here, and not
&s;ay, that <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Virtue hung very loo&s;e
on him, or the Woman's Faith, like a Fa&s;|cination,
could never have extracted it a|gain&s;t
his Will and Knowledge: But what
if they &s;hould &s;ay, that <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> being &s;e|cretly
appriz'd of the Woman's Faith,
and Touch of him, took the Hint; and
to comfort and confirm her in her Conceit,
and to help the Cure forward, &s;aid, <HI>Vir|tue
was gone out of him?</HI> This would
be an untoward Sugge&s;tion, which if In|fidels
&s;hould make, our Divines mu&s;t look
for a Reply to it.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid of the <HI>Pope,</HI> when he was
la&s;t at <HI>Benevento,</HI> that he wrought three
Miracles, which our Prote&s;tant <HI>Clergy,</HI> I
dare &s;ay, believe nothing at all of. But,
for all that, it is not improbable, but that
<PB N="17" REF="24">
&s;ome di&s;ea&s;ed People, con&s;idering their
&s;uper&s;titious Veneration for the <HI>Pope,</HI> and
their Opinion of the Sanctity of the <HI>Pre&s;ent,</HI>
might be per&s;uaded of his Gift of Miracles,
and de&s;irous of his Exerci&s;e of it; and if
they fancyfully or actually received Bene|fit
by his Touch, I don't wonder, without
a Miracle. And what if we had been told
of the <HI>Popes</HI> curing an <HI>Haemorrhage</HI> like
this before us? What would <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI>
have &s;aid to it? Why, &startq;that a fooli&s;h,
credulous, and &s;uper&s;titious Woman had
fancy'd her&s;elf cured of &s;ome &s;light In|di&s;po&s;ition;
and the crafty <HI>Pope</HI> and his
Adherents, a&s;piring after popular Ap|plau&s;e,
magnified the pre&s;umed Cure
into a Miracle. If they would have us
<HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> to believe the Miracle, they
&s;hould have given us an exacter De&s;crip|tion
of her Di&s;ea&s;e, and then we could
better have judg'd of it&endq;. The Appli|cation
of &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ed Story of a Mi|racle
wrought by the <HI>Pope,</HI> is ea&s;y; and
if <HI>Infidels, Jews,</HI> and <HI>Mahometans,</HI> who
have no better Opinion of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> than we
have of the <HI>Pope,</HI> &s;hould make it, there's
no Help for it.</P>
<P>And thus have I made my De&s;cants on
this &s;uppo&s;ed Miracle before us, and ar|gued,
as much as I could, again&s;t the Mi|raculou&s;ne&s;s
of it, both from the <HI>Nature</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="25">
of the Di&s;ea&s;e, and the <HI>Manner</HI> of the
Cure of it. Whether any one &s;hall think
I have &s;aid any thing to the Purpo&s;e or
not, is all one to me. My De&s;ign in what
I have done, is not to do Service to Infi|delity,
but, upon the Command and En|couragement
of the Fathers, to turn Mens
Thoughts to the my&s;tical Meaning of the
&s;aid Miracle, which I come now to give
an Account of.</P>

them&s;elves, when they &s;peak of this Mi|racle,
about the Nature of the Di&s;ea&s;e,
literally, in this Woman, or the greatne&s;s
of the Cure of it; but alone bend their

the &s;ake of which, this Evangelical Story

<P>The <HI>twelve Years</HI> of the Woman's Af|fliction

Number of the Church's impure State for

whether &s;ome of the primitive Church
did not, by the &s;aid <HI>twelve Years</HI> of the

of the Church, &s;hould be the &s;ame
with the Woman<NOTE N="13" PLACE="foot">Revel. Chap. <HI>$word$</HI> v. 6</NOTE> in the Wilderne&s;s,
that, as St. <HI>John</HI> &s;ays, was twelve Hun|dred
and &s;ixty Days or Years th$re &s;$&s;tain|ed;
and by whom many Prote&s;tants, as
well as the Fathers, under&s;tand the Church
univer&s;al. When the &s;aid twelve Hundred
and &s;ixty Days or Years of the Church's
being in the Wilderne&s;s, did commence
or will end, is none of my Bu&s;ine&s;s to
enquire or a&s;certain. But as this Woman

Affliction, to be cured of her Di&s;ea&s;e by
<HI>Je&s;us;</HI> &s;o it is the Opinion of the Fathers,
that the Church univer&s;al, after <HI>twelve
Hundred Years</HI> of her Wilderne&s;s State,
will be purified and &s;anctified by the Gifts
of the Spirit of Chri&s;t, and enter upon a
more holy, peaceable, and happy Condition,
ab&s;olutely freed from her <HI>I&s;&s;ue of Blood,</HI>
which, through Per&s;ecution and War, &s;he
has for many Ages labour'd under. It is
not my Concern to collect all the Autho|rities
of the Fathers to this Purpo&s;e; but
only &s;ay, that if at the End of twelve Hun|dred
and &s;ixty Days or Years, the Church,
like the Woman, be not cur'd of her <HI>Hae|morrhage</HI>
and my&s;tical <HI>Wounds</HI> and <HI>Sores&punc;</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="28">
if her pre&s;ent impure and un&s;ound State
be not chang'd into an holy, healthy, and
peaceable one; many good <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> as

So the Di&s;ea&s;es of the Church in
time have increa&s;ed, for all the U&s;e &s;he
has made of her &s;piritual Phy&s;icians, <HI>th$
Clergy.</HI> In every Age has the Church
been degenerating in Morals and Principles,
as any one knows, that is able to make an
E&s;timate of Religion in times pa&s;t; and
all along have her eccle&s;ia&s;tical <HI>Quack
Doctors</HI> contributed to her ill State of
Health. As many Phy&s;icians with their
different Applications tormented the poor
Woman; &s;o our many <HI>Empericks</HI> in The|ology
with their different <HI>Schemes</HI> of
<PB N="23" REF="30">
Church Government and various <HI>Sy&s;tems</HI> of
Divinity, like &s;o many Pre&s;criptions for
Cure, have increa&s;ed the Divi&s;ions, wid|en'd
the Wounds, and inflamed the Sores
of the Church. And if the Woman's <HI>I&s;|&s;ue
of Blood</HI> be, according to the Fathers,
a particular Type of the Blood of the
Church, that is &s;hed in Per&s;ecution and
War; our Theological Pretenders to Phy|&s;ick,
have been &s;o far from providing and
pre&s;cribing a good <HI>Stiptic</HI> in this Ca&s;e,
that they have been the Occa&s;ion of the Ef|fu&s;ion
of much Chri&s;tian Blood; there hav|ing
been many a War and Per&s;ecution, that
the&s;e <HI>Inci&s;ion</HI> Doctors, who &s;hould be all
<HI>Bal&s;am,</HI> have been the Cau&s;e of.</P>
<P>The Woman <HI>&s;pent all her Living,</HI> all
her yearly Income, upon her Phy&s;icians,
and as it &s;eems to a bad Purpo&s;e; &s;o very
great and large Revenues of the Church,
are expended on her eccle&s;ia&s;tical Doctors
in &s;piritual Phy&s;ick: And to what End
and Purpo&s;e? Why, to open and widen
the bleeding Wounds of the Church,
which they &s;hould heal and &s;alve up. It
is now about <HI>twelve Hundred Years,</HI> like
the <HI>twelve Years</HI> of the Woman, that the
<HI>Clergy,</HI> our Practitioners in Theological
Phy&s;ick, have received of the Church
va&s;t Fees, Stipends and Gratuities (for be|fore
that time her <HI>Doctors</HI> pre&s;crib'd free|ly)
to take care of her Health and Wel|fare;
<PB N="24" REF="31">
but unle&s;s God provide in due time
a Medicine of his own, &s;he is likely to
continue in a di&s;ea&s;ed and &s;orowful Con|dition
for all them.</P>
<P>One would think that the Woman of
the Go&s;pel might have had more Wit than
to lay out all &s;he was worth upon <HI>Phy&s;i|cians</HI>
to no good Purpo&s;e; one would
think that after &s;ome Experience of them
In&s;ufficiency to cure her, &s;he might have
forborn feeing them, and re&s;erved the Re|mains
of her E&s;tate for better U&s;es: So
the Fees and Revenues of the Church, af|ter
due Experience of the Inability of her
&s;piritual Doctors to heal her Sores, might
have been in my Opinion better employ'd,
and the Church of Chri&s;t more out of
Danger of Wounds and Sickne&s;s, by Sin
and Error. Certain it is, that many an <HI>I&s;&s;ue
of Blood,</HI> through Per&s;ecution and War,
had been prevented; if &s;uch barbarous
and blood thir&s;ty Doctors of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical
Phy&s;ick, had never been &s;o fee'd and hired
to take care of the Welfare of the Church,
which, for all their Spiritual Medicines,
will continue in a langui&s;hing Condi|tion,
till heal'd by the Virtue and Graces
of the Spirit of Chri&s;t in his fore&s;aid ap|pointed
Time.</P>
<P>So much then to the my&s;tical Interpre|tation
of the Story of the Cure of the
<PB N="25" REF="32">
<HI>I&s;&s;ue of Blood</HI> in this Woman. Every mi|nute
Circum&s;tance of it is thus to be al|legorized,
if need was. Whether the
<HI>Clergy</HI> will like this parabolical Explica|tion
of it, I neither know nor care. They
have their Liberty with <HI>Athei&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Infi|dels</HI>
to believe as little of it as they think
fit; and I hope they'll give me leave with
the Fathers of the Church to believe as
much of it as I plea&s;e. But whether they
approve of this allegorial Interpretation
of this &s;uppo&s;ed Miracle or not; they mu&s;t

<P>After &s;uch a my&s;tical Healing of the
<HI>Haemorrhage</HI> of the Church, there's no
doubt on't, but the Story of this Woman
in the Go&s;pel will be allow'd to be typical
and emblematical. In the mean time, with|out
making a Parable of the Story of her,
I a&s;&s;ert, there is little or nothing of a
Miracle to be made of her Cure, unle&s;s
we were at a greater Certainty about the
<PB N="27" REF="34">
Nature of her Di&s;ea&s;e, and the Manner,
rationally &s;peaking, of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s healing of
it. And &s;o I pa&s;s to the Con&s;ideration
of</P>
<P>2. Another Story of a miraculous Cure
perform'd by <HI>Je&s;us</HI> on another Woman,
and that is on her, who<NOTE N="22" PLACE="foot"><HI>Luke Ch.</HI> xiii.</NOTE> <HI>had a Spi|rit
of Infirmity, eighteen Years, and was
bow'd together, and could in no wi&s;e
lift up her&s;elf&mdash;being bound of Sa|tan,</HI>
&amp;c. This too, as I &s;uppo&s;e, is with
our <HI>Divines</HI> a great Miracle, and one
of the greate&s;t that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> wrought,
or it had not been &s;pecify'd, but ca&s;t
indi&s;criminately into the Number of all
manner of Di&s;ea&s;es, which he heal'd.
And for the &s;ake of the Letter, and to
plea&s;e our <HI>Divines,</HI> whom I would not
offend wilfully, I will allow, that <HI>Je&s;us</HI>
might lay his Hands on, and &s;peak com|fortably
to &s;uch a drooping, &s;tooping, and
vaporous Woman, full of Fancies of the
<HI>Devil</HI>'s Temptation and Power over her;
and &s;he might thereupon recover, and be
afterwards of a more chearful Heart, and
erect Countenance, freed from the whim|&s;ical
Imagination of being <HI>Satan-ridden:</HI>
And what of all that? Where's the Mi|racle?
<PB N="28" REF="35">
If the Story of &s;uch a Miracle had
been related of any <HI>Impo&s;tor</HI> in Religion,
of an <HI>Arch-Heretick,</HI> or <HI>Popi&s;h Exorci&s;t,</HI>
our <HI>Divines</HI> would have flouted at it;
they would have told us, there was no|thing
&s;upernatural and uncommon in the
Event, nor any thing at all to be won|der'd
at in it. Taking the <HI>Devil</HI> out of
this Story, and there's no more in it, than
what's common for a &s;imple, melancholy,
and drooping Woman, to be chear'd and
elated upon the comfortable Advice and
Admonition of a reputedly wi&s;e and good
Man. And the putting the <HI>Devil</HI> into
the Story, in another Ca&s;e, our <HI>Divines</HI>
would have &s;aid was only the Fancy of
the Woman, or the Device of the <HI>Mira|cle-Monger,</HI>
to magnify his own Art and
Power&punc; And if <HI>Infidels, Jews,</HI> and <HI>Ma|hometans,</HI>
&s;hould &s;ay &s;o of this Story of
<HI>Je&s;us,</HI> they would be no more unrea&s;on|able
in their Conjectures and Solutions of
this Miracle, than we &s;hould have been in
another and parallel Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pope,</HI> when la&s;t at <HI>Benevento,</HI> is
&s;aid to have exorciz'd a <HI>Daemon</HI> out of a
young Maid, which our <HI>Divines</HI> no more
believe than <HI>Infidels</HI> do. But it is not at
all impo&s;&s;ible or improbable, that a young
Woman might be troubled with Vapours&punc;
and go droopingly upon it, whom the
<PB N="29" REF="36">
holy Father, of who&s;e Prayers and San|ctity
&s;he had a good Opinion, might re|lieve
with his Talk, and give another Turn
to her Thoughts and Temper: And if &s;he
$ancy'd her&s;elf before po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with a <HI>Dae|mon,</HI>
or rather, if the <HI>Pope</HI>'s Partizans per|&s;uaded
her &s;o, it's not unlikely to make a
Miracle on't. Ju&s;t &s;o may <HI>Infidels,</HI> with
their De&s;cants on this Miracle before us,
reduce and le&s;&s;en it: And what mu&s;t we
Believers do then? Why, we mu&s;t find
out a Way to a&s;certain the Truth and
Greatne&s;s of the Miracle, or give it up.
We mu&s;t determine certainly what was the
Woman's Di&s;temper, and how the Cure
of it by ordinary Means was impo&s;&s;ible, or
make no more Words about it.</P>
<P>And how can we come at the Know|ledge
of this Woman's Di&s;ea&s;e, but by
the original Words of the <HI>Evangeli&s;t.</HI>
St. <HI>Luke</HI> &s;ays, &s;he was one <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">,
<HI>that had a Spirit of Weakne&s;s,</HI>
that is, was poor-Spirited and pu&s;ilani|mous;
and if &s;he was <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>bow'd
down</HI> upon't, its no more than might be
expected of a di&s;con&s;olate, melancholy and
dejected Per&s;on. Here then is the Di&s;ea&s;e
of the Woman: If it had been wor&s;e, St.
<HI>Luke,</HI> the Phy&s;ician, if he was of Suffi|ciency
in his Art, &s;hould better have ex|pre&s;s'd
him&s;elf; &s;o as to give us another
<PB N="30" REF="37">
Conception of it. And if <HI>Satan</HI> had not
been brought into the Tale, whom it is
ea&s;y, by rea&s;oning as above, to exorci&s;e
out of it, here is a no more grievous Di|&s;temper,
than what upon the comfortable
Exhortations of a wi&s;e Man may be cu$ed.
And do what our Divines can, they can
make literally no more of this Story.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that for <HI>eighteen Years</HI> the
Woman labour'd under this Di&s;ea&s;e. And
&s;he might be <HI>hippi&s;h</HI> and <HI>drooping</HI> for a
longer time, and be no le&s;s ea&s;ily at la&s;t
cured. It's pity the <HI>Evangeli&s;t</HI> had not
told us how old this Woman was, when
the Di&s;temper fir&s;t &s;eiz'd her; then we
could have made better Conjectures about
the Nature and Cure of it. If there was
any room to &s;uppo&s;e, either from the
Words of Scripture or extra-&s;criptural Hi|&s;tory,
that &s;he was about <HI>fifty</HI> or <HI>&s;ixty,</HI>
when &s;he fir&s;t began to droop and the
<HI>Devil</HI> got upon her Back; here had been
Scope for a mo&s;t &s;tupendous Miracle; and
our <HI>Divines</HI> might have a&s;&s;erted, what
no Body could have contradicted, that <HI>Je|&s;us</HI>
had made an old Woman, who was
<HI>bow'd down,</HI> not only under the Weight
of <HI>Satan,</HI> but under the Burthen of &s;e|venty
or eighty Years, young again; and
had re&s;tored her to the Health, Vigor,
and Beauty of one of fifteen. Here would
<PB N="31" REF="38">
have been a mighty Miracle indeed. And
I don't doubt, but our <HI>Divines</HI> would
willingly get into &s;uch a Notion of this
Miracle, and would heartily e&s;pou&s;e it,
but for the Offence they mu&s;t needs give
to decrepid old Women, who may be out
of Conceit with them&s;elves upon it, as if
they carried the <HI>Devil</HI> on their Shoulders,
as the Cau&s;e of their Decripedne&s;s and
Incurvity. And &s;uch an Offence would be
of ill Con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Rea&s;onably then &s;peaking, there was
not much in the Di&s;ea&s;e and Cure of this
Woman. Excepting that Part, which <HI>Sa|tan</HI>
bears, in the Story, there is nothing
wonderful in it. And &s;uppo&s;ing <HI>Je&s;us</HI>
might exorci&s;e the <HI>Devil</HI> out of this Wo|man,
or di&s;mount him from off her
Shoulders; yet even this makes nothing
for his Divine Power and Authority, in
as much as many <HI>Exorci&s;ts</HI> among the
<HI>Jews</HI> and even among <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> if Prote|&s;tants
had not more Wit than to believe it,
could do as much. And after all, I don't
believe the <HI>Evangeli&s;t</HI> intended, that our
Saviour &s;hould be had in Admiration for
the Letter of this Miracle, or St. <HI>Luke</HI>
would accurately have de&s;cribed the Di&s;|ea&s;e,
&s;o as to put it out of the Power of
Nature and Art to heal it, and of the
Wit of <HI>Infidels</HI> to cavil at the miraculous
<PB N="32" REF="39">
Cure of it. Neither do I find that the
Fathers of the Church ever trouble them|&s;elves
about the Letter of this Story,
which is &s;ome Argument, that no great
Heed is to be given to it; but are only cu|rious
about the My&s;tery, for which this
Miracle was related, and which I come
now to give an Account of.</P>

this Part of it. <HI>Origen</HI> &s;ays, there are
&s;ome things of the Go&s;pel related as Facts,
which were not done; and I believe this
of the Ruler of the Synagogue to be one
of them. Human Nature, I think, is not
capable of &s;uch ba&s;e and unnatural Re|&s;entment.
Works of Nece&s;&s;ity, and re|qui&s;ite
Offices of Kindne&s;s and Charity to
Man and Bea&s;t, were allow'd by the Law,

that I can't but think <HI>bad,</HI> as well as <HI>good</HI>
Men, would rather glorify God, that had
given &s;uch Power unto Man, than find
fault with it. But in the My&s;tery of this
Part of the Story, there is clear Sen&s;e
and Truth. Who then is this <HI>Archi&s;y|nagogus</HI>

is the great Difficulty in the my&s;t$cal

the great Curio&s;ity of my Readers to know
how I will acco$$t for it. If the Fathers

&s;hall not recount them all here, much le&s;s

rational, and cabali&s;tical Notion of
Hell, which I have learned of the Fa|thers,
who &s;ignify, that the babyloni&s;h
<PB N="42" REF="49">

<P>And thus have I &s;poken to the Miracle
of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s healing the <HI>Woman of her Spi|rit
of Infirmity, whom Satan had bound
<PB N="47" REF="54">
and bow'd down,</HI> which, according to
the Letter, is no Miracle at all; and
&s;ome Parts of the Story are improbable
and incredible; but the my&s;tical Comple|tion
of it will be mo&s;t prodigious, and a
Demon&s;tration not only of Chri&s;t's Power
and Pre&s;ence in his Church, but of his
<HI>Me&s;&s;ia&s;hip,</HI> in as much as a va&s;t Number
of Prophecies of the <HI>Old Te&s;tament,</HI> more
than can &s;oon be collected to this Purpo&s;e,
will thereupon receive their Accompli&s;h|ment.
And &s;o I come to a</P>
<P>3. <HI>Third</HI> miraculous Story of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s,
that is of his telling (<HI>John</HI> iv.) the Wo|man
of <HI>Samaria</HI> her Fortune, <HI>of having
had five Husbands, and being then an
Adultere&s;s,</HI> &amp;c. in which there is a nota|ble
Miracle di&s;play'd, in the Opinion of
our <HI>Divines,</HI> that proves <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Omni&s;ci|ence,
or he could not &s;o have &s;earch'd
into the Heart of this Woman, and told
her &s;uch Occurrences, that concern'd her
Life pa&s;t. I thought once of tran&s;cribing
here entirely this Story; and &s;o I would,
but that it is a long one, and might have
&s;et &s;ome Readers, who are by this time
awaken'd to pry into the Ab&s;urdities of the
Letter, a laughing, before I had time my
&s;elf regularly to animadvert on it.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="55">
Whether there was any Truth at all in
the Letter of this Story, I &s;hould much
have que&s;tioned, but that &s;ome Fathers
write of it, as if they believed it literally
tho' they make a my&s;tical and allegorical
Explication of the whole and every part
of it. And I, having a &s;incere Veneration
for the Fathers, will not contradict them,
(and I hope this Conce&s;&s;ion will plea&s;e the
<HI>Clergy)</HI> but, for all that, can't like any
part of this Story literally, but could al|mo&s;t
wi&s;h, that the Fathers, for the Ho|nour
of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> had made the whole no
other than a Parable.</P>
<P>It's &s;trange, that no <HI>Jews</HI> or <HI>Infidels</HI>
have as yet ludicrou&s;ly treated this Story
to the, almo&s;t, Confutation of our Reli|gion.
If their Tongues had not been ty'd
by the afore&s;aid <HI>Satan</HI> or <HI>Adver&s;ary</HI> to
Liberty, I can't think but they mu&s;t have
made &s;ome plea&s;ant Animadver&s;ions upon
it before now. If &s;uch a broken, ellip|tical,
and ab&s;urd Tale had been told of
any other Impo&s;tor in Religion; the Wits
of our <HI>Clergy</HI> had been at Work to expo&s;e
it plentifully; and indeed there's no need
of much Wit to make this Tale nau&s;eous
and ridiculous to vulgar Under&s;tandings.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not my&s;elf here make all the Re|marks
I can to the Di&s;advantage of this
Story: I am not as yet &s;o di&s;po&s;ed to make
<PB N="49" REF="56">
Scoffers and <HI>Infidels</HI> laugh at the <HI>Clergy</HI>
for their Adherence to the Letter of it.
All I &s;hall do now, is to make my Ob&s;er|vations
on the two U&s;es, that the Clergy
very &s;eriou&s;ly put this Story to, and they
are,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> to prove the Expectation that
there was among&s;t the <HI>Samaritans,</HI> of a
<HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> to come; And</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> to prove <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Omni&s;cience,
or he could not have entered into the Heart
of the Woman, and told her, that &s;he
had had five Husbands, and was then an
Adultere&s;s. To the&s;e two Purpo&s;es, I
find this Story urged by our <HI>Divines,</HI> and
I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, as to the</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t</HI> of them; it is rightly from hence
a&s;&s;erted by the<NOTE N="46" PLACE="foot">Defence of Chri&s;tianity, <HI>p.</HI> 8.</NOTE> <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> of <HI>Lichfield</HI>
and others, that the <HI>Samaritans</HI> had an
Expectation of a <HI>Me&s;&s;iah:</HI> But why then
did not the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> and others, who are
now in Que&s;t after Arguments of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s
Me&s;&s;iah&s;hip, prove him hence to be the
<HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> becau&s;e he told the <HI>Samaritan</HI>
Woman her Fortune? If this was a real
and &s;ub&s;tantial Argument to her of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s
<HI>Me&s;&s;iah&s;hip,</HI> it ought to be urg'd by the
Clergy at this Day. The Controver&s;y
about <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Me&s;&s;iah&s;hip is now on foot;
<PB N="50" REF="57">
Why do the Advocates for it overlook this
Proof of it? Why, becau&s;e, as I &s;uppo&s;e,
they are aware, that <HI>Infidels</HI> would make
&s;port with it. But if <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s telling the
Woman her Fortune was no real and
conclu&s;ive Argument of his being the <HI>Me&s;|&s;iah;</HI>

a Fortune, as <HI>Je&s;us</HI> by Craft might come

Repre&s;entation of what would be my&s;teri|ou&s;ly
and more wonderfully done by him.</P>

Miracles, propo&s;ed to be treated on in this

general Head, which is, <HI>to con&s;ider what
Je&s;us means when he appeals to his Mi|racles
as to a Witne&s;s of his Divine Au|thority;</HI>
I mu&s;t take to Task &s;ome more
of his pretended Miracles, even till I have
not left him a good, credible and &s;ub&s;tan|tial
Miracle, according to the Letter, to
appeal to. The Con&s;equence of which
will be, that his my&s;terious Operations
<PB N="63" REF="70">
are to prove his Authority and Me&s;&s;ia&s;hip;
or we mu&s;t give up him and his Religion
for a Piece of Fraud and Impo&s;ture</P>
<P>What Miracles will be the Subject of
my next Di&s;cour&s;e, I can't certainly fore|tell,
but there are many Hi&s;torical as well
as miraculous Parts of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Life, that
according to the Letter, are to be call'd
into Que&s;tion; &s;uch as</P>
<P>The Hi&s;tory of his riding on an A&s;s to
<HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> I have given &s;ome Offence on
this Point already in my <HI>Moderator,</HI> and
ought to excu&s;e or ju&s;tify my &s;elf, by calling
the Fathers to Account for laughing at the
Letter of that Story. It was an untoward
Saying of St. <HI>Jerome,</HI> that I there cited, and
&s;uffered a Pro&s;ecution for: But it is a wor&s;e
Intimation of St. <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> who,
if there was any literal Truth in the Peo|ples
pulling off their Garments, and
Branches of Trees, and &s;trewing them in
the Way of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> will needs have it not re|&s;pectfully
but mi&s;chievou&s;ly done, to make
the Colt &s;tumble, and &s;o di&s;mount his Ri|der.
And according to him it may be q$e|&s;tioned,
whether the <HI>Ho&s;annahs</HI> of the
People were of any more Re&s;pect to <HI>Je&s;us,</HI>
than the <HI>Huzzahs</HI> of a <HI>Mob</HI> would be to
the Bi&s;hop of <HI>L&mdash;n,</HI> if to &s;hew his

upon an A&s;s, in his <HI>Pontificalibus</HI> thro$gh
<PB N="64" REF="71">
this City. But I have here a momentous
Controver&s;y to decide about the Bea&s;t <HI>Je|&s;us</HI>
rode on. St. <HI>Matthew</HI> &s;eems to &s;ay,
he rode upon both <HI>A&s;s</HI> and <HI>Colt</HI> together
St. <HI>Mark</HI> and St. <HI>Luke</HI> &s;ay, he rode upon
the <HI>Colt, on which Man never before &s;at.</HI>
The Bi&s;hop of <HI>Lichfeild</HI> &s;ays, he rode
upon the <HI>A&s;s</HI> (on which Man had before
&s;at) and the <HI>Colt</HI> ambled after. St. <HI>Cyril</HI>
and St. <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tom</HI> &s;ay, he rode upon the
<HI>Colt,</HI> and the <HI>She-A&s;s</HI> trotted after. St.
<HI>John</HI> the <HI>Evangeli&s;t</HI> &s;ays, he rode upon
a <HI>Mule,</HI> or an <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> A&s;s-like Creature of
the neuter Gender. The <HI>Jewi&s;h Cabali&s;ts</HI>
&s;ay, their <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> was to ride on a great
huge <HI>A&s;s,</HI> big enough to carry him and
all true I&s;raelites, and that the Mini&s;ters

So do the great Doctors of the World
differ! To whom I &s;hall decree the Prize
of Orthodoxy, I &s;han't foretel; but am

Our <HI>Divines,</HI> who &s;hould know

<HI>Hell-Gates</HI> upon him; I appeal to hone&s;t
plain Chri&s;tians, whether &s;uch an <HI>Herc$|lean</HI>
Labour would not have plea&s;ed them
well. Ever &s;ince I read of <HI>Martin Lu|ther</HI>'s
Conver&s;ation with the <HI>Devil,</HI> I have
had but indifferent Thoughts of his <HI>Pro|te&s;tanti&s;m;</HI>
and unle&s;s the Fathers $word$
this Story before us into My&s;tery, Allego|ry
and Cabali&s;m, I &s;hall think ill of Chri|&s;tianity.</P>
<P>I &s;hould al&s;o take into Examination the
Story of an Angel's appearing to the Shep|herds,
and &s;aying to them; <HI>Behold I
bring you Tidings of great Joy,</HI> &amp;c. If
there was any Truth literally in <HI>this</HI> Sto|ry,
and in <HI>that</HI> of a Star's appearing to
the wi&s;e Men, there mu&s;t be a great Mi|&s;take
in the Report of both of them. St.
<HI>Matthew</HI> and St. <HI>Luke</HI> have both blun|der'd.
It was the Star that appear'd to
the Shepherds by Night; and the Angel
(I &s;peak upon Rea&s;on and Authority) that
was &s;ent to the wi&s;e Men. What then
to do with the&s;e two Stories, and to &s;alve
the Credit of the <HI>Evangeli&s;ts,</HI> I knew
not, till the Fathers directed me to the
U&s;e of a mythological <HI>Metamorpho&s;is:</HI>
And then I pre&s;ently learn'd the Trick
on't, to transform Stars into Angels, and
Shepherds too, or Pa&s;tors of Chri&s;t's Flock
<PB N="67" REF="74">
(which was the Difficulty) into wi&s;e Men;
and &s;o I made one Moral or Mi&s;tery of
the two Fables.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t al&s;o &s;ome Time take to task the
Story of the <HI>many dead Bodies of the
Saints, that upon Chri&s;t's Re&s;urrection,
came out of their Graves, and appear'd
unto many;</HI> which is too imperfectly re|lated
to merit Credit. The <HI>Evangeli&s;t,</HI>
if he would have a rea&s;onable Man believe
his Story, &s;hould have told us, who tho&s;e
Saints were, and what Numbers of them;
and whether they appear'd to the converted
or unconverted <HI>Jews;</HI> whether they were
&s;ome of the Patriarchs and Prophets of old,
or &s;ome lately departed Di&s;ciples, who, for
all <HI>Je&s;us's</HI> healing Power, died in the
Time of his Mini&s;try; and whether there
were any Women among tho&s;e Saints; and
whether they appear'd naked (as <HI>Je&s;us</HI>
mode&s;tly did to <HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> unle&s;s he
&s;$ip'd him&s;elf by <HI>Stealth</HI> into the Cloths
of the Gardener, which might be the Rea&s;on
of her Mi&s;take, for &s;he &s;uppos'd &s;he &s;aw
the Gardener) and whether they return'd
again to Corruption, or a&s;cended into
Heaven. For want of the&s;e &s;pecifical Cir|cum&s;tances,
the <HI>Evangeli&s;t</HI> has told us a
Tale, that has neither Head nor Foot to it:
and unle&s;s the Fathers my&s;tically an&s;wer,
to Satisfaction, every one of the afore&s;aid
<PB N="68" REF="75">
<HI>Queries,</HI> I'll reject this Story for mere Ro|mance
and Impo&s;ture.</P>
<P>The&s;e and many other hi&s;torical and
&s;eemingly miraculous Stories of the Go&s;pel,
are &s;ome time to be taken into Con&s;idera|tion;
for I will not give this Work over,
till I have demon&s;trated beyond all Con|tradiction,
that the evangelical Writings
are but the Shadow of Divine My&s;teries;
and that literal Interpreters, whom<NOTE N="68" PLACE="foot">Ut Lex Um bram continet futurorum bono|rum, quae declarantur ab ea Lege; &s;ic etiam E|vangelium, quod vel a quibu&s;que vulgaribus intel|ligi exi&s;timatur, Umbram docet My&s;teriorum Chri&s;ti. <HI>In Praefat. ad Johan.

<HI>Origen</HI> calls <HI>vulgar Capacities,</HI> are under
a Mi&s;take, if they think, they under&s;tand
any Thing, as they ought, of the four
Go&s;pels.</P>
<P>I &s;hould conclude now, as it becomes a
<HI>Moderator,</HI> with an Addre&s;s to <HI>Infidels</HI>
and <HI>Apo&s;tates,</HI> the great Combatants in
this Controver&s;y. But I have not Room
to be as large, as I would, in my Exhor|tations
to them di&s;tinctly, &s;o I can only
de&s;ire them to continue the Controver&s;y
with Zeal and Vigour, not doubting but
it will end to the Honour of Je&s;us, the
Good of his Church, and the Happine&s;s
of Mankind. The ble&s;&s;ed Fruits of this
Controver&s;y are already &s;een and &s;elt in
<PB N="69" REF="76">
the almo&s;t Cure of a mo&s;t malignant Di|&s;temper,
call'd <HI>Bigottry,</HI> which has been
the Bane of human Society, and in Times
pa&s;t more de&s;tructive of the World than
either War or Pe&s;tilence. Go on then,
<HI>Great</HI> and <HI>Good Sirs,</HI> till the Cure is per|fected.
And as you merit Prai&s;es and Re|wards
for your &s;everal Labours; So I hope
you'll meet with them. The <HI>Nobility</HI>
and <HI>Gentry</HI> of the Kingdom, as I learn,
are &s;en&s;ibly touch'd with the U&s;efulne&s;s of
this Controver&s;y; whereupon it is to be
hoped the <HI>Legi&s;lative Authority</HI> will &s;oon
give Thanks to the great Mr. <HI>Grounds</HI> and
Mr. <HI>Scheme</HI> for their Pains in it; and not
forget to do Ju&s;tice to the <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> and <HI>Clergy</HI>
according to their Merits. But I can't &s;tay
here to talk more on this Head, being
obliged to make an Epi&s;tolary</P>
<P><HI>P. S.</HI> To Mr. <HI>T. Ray,</HI> the Author of
a <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e,</HI> call'd <HI>Our Saviour's Mira|cles
vindicated,</HI> &amp;c. As I, <HI>Sir,</HI> enter'd
the <HI>Pre&s;s,</HI> you came forth, or I might
po&s;&s;ibly have paid more of my Re&s;pects to
you another Way. But upon mature Con|&s;ideration,
I found a properer Reply could
not be made to you, than is the foregoing
Di&s;cour&s;e; which, if you are not &s;ick of
your former Performance, will find you
&s;ome more Work. And that you may
<PB N="70" REF="77">
write more pertinently again&s;t this Di&s;|cour&s;e,
than you did again&s;t my other,
I'll give you &s;ome In&s;tructions, <HI>viz.</HI> if you
think of writing to the Purpo&s;e, you mu&s;t
prove the&s;e two Things; <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> that the
Fathers did not hold the Stories of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s
Miracles to be typical and figurative; and
<HI>Secondly,</HI> that <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Miracles neither
will nor can receive a my&s;terious and more
wonderful Accompli&s;hment. But you have
not &s;aid one Syllable to either of the&s;e
Points; con&s;equently have written nothing
to the Purpo&s;e again&s;t me. As for In|&s;tance;
In the Miracle of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s <HI>driving
the Buyers and Sellers out of the Temple:</HI>
You &s;hould prove, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> that the Fathers
don't hold that Miracle to be typical of
the future Ejection of <HI>Bi&s;hops, Prie&s;ts,</HI>
and <HI>Deacons</HI> out of the Church, that
make Merchandize of the Go&s;pel: And <HI>Se|condly,</HI>
that it was impo&s;&s;ible that the Mi|racle
&s;hould receive &s;uch an Accompli&s;h|ment.
But you have done nothing of this.
So, if you &s;hould attempt again to write
again&s;t this Di&s;cour&s;e, as for In&s;tance, a|gain&s;t
my Explication of the Miracle of
<HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s healing the Woman, that <HI>had an
I&s;&s;ue of Blood;</HI> you mu&s;t prove that <HI>that</HI>
Story neither was in the Opinion of the
Fathers Typical, nor could receive a my|&s;tical
Accompli&s;hment; or you may as
<PB N="71" REF="78">
well hold your Peace. And after all, whe|ther
your Rea&s;onings for the Letter of
Chri&s;t's Miracles, are equal to mine again&s;t
it, let our Readers judge, who will ea&s;ily
di&s;cern, that you jump over my choice&s;t
Invectives again&s;t the Letter, as if you was
afraid of being touch'd by them.</P>
<P>As to your charging me fal&s;ly in one or
two Places, with Mi&s;repre&s;entations of
the Fathers, I'll expostulate that Matter
with you, when I hear that the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> of
<HI>London</HI> gives your Performance, the Repu|tation
of a &s;olid, and &s;ub&s;tantial one, by
a Change of your <HI>Cloak</HI> into a <HI>Gown,</HI>
which you &s;eem to aim at; or you had
never &s;o be&s;mear'd the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> with your
Compliments, nor had been &s;o mealy|mouth'd
as to the Point of Liberty.</P>
<P>But what need you, <HI>Sir,</HI> have told the
World, that you take me for an <HI>Unbeliev|er
of the Scriptures.</HI> If the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI>'s
wi&s;e Pro&s;ecution of me for an <HI>Infidel</HI> had
not given you the Hint, you could never
of your &s;elf have made that Di&s;covery.
And why did you not join the Fathers
with me in Unbelief? I thought I had
been of the &s;ame Faith with them. A
Man of your Penetration into another's
Principles, will, I &s;uppo&s;e, from this
pre&s;ent going Di&s;cour&s;e, conclude me to be
<PB N="72" REF="79">
a downright <HI>Athei&s;t.</HI> And what mu&s;t I do
then to clear my &s;elf!</P>
<P>If you write any more, <HI>Sir,</HI> I de&s;ire
you, without making more Ha&s;te than
good Speed, to be as expeditious as yo$
can; or you will not prevent my Pub|lication
of another Di&s;cour&s;e, like the&s;e
two, to the Honour of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> to whom
be Glory for ever and ever. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
