<HEAD>THE ELEPHANT<NOTE N="&ast;" TYPE="foot"><P>The Elephant has a long cartilaginous trunk, formed of multitudes of rings, pliant in all directions, and terminated with a &s;mall moveable hook. The no&s;trils are at the end of the trunk, which is u&s;ed, like a hand, to convey any thing in|to the mouth. This animal has no cutting teeth, but four large flat grinders in each jaw, and in the upper, two va&s;t tu&s;ks, pointing forwards, and bending a little upwards; the large&s;t of them imported into Britain are &s;even feet long, and weigh 152 pounds each. The eyes are &s;mall, and the ears long, broad and pendulous. The back is much arched. The legs are thick, and very clum&s;y and &s;hapele&s;s. The feet are undivided; but their margins are terminated by five round hoofs. The tail is like that of a hog. The colour of the &s;kin is du&s;ky, with a few &s;cattered hairs on it; <HI>Pennant's &s;ynop&s;.</HI></P>

<P>IF the human &s;pecies be excepted, the Ele|phant
is the mo&s;t re&s;pectable animal in the
world. In &s;ize he &s;urpa&s;&s;es all other terre&s;trial
creatures; and, by his intelligence, he makes as
<PB N="2" REF="5">
near an approach to man as matter can approach
&s;pirit<NOTE N="&ast;" TYPE="foot">Valet &s;en&s;u et reliqua &s;agacitate ingenii excellit elephas; <HI>Ari&s;t. Hi&s;t. anim. lib. 9. cap.</HI> 46&mdash;Elephanti &s;unt natura mites et man&s;u$ti. ut ad rationale animal proxime accedant; <HI>Strabo.</HI>&mdash;Vidi elephantos quo&s;dam qui prudentiores mihi videbantur quam quibu&s;dam in locis homines; <HI>Vartomannus, apud Ge&s;ner. cap. de Elephant$.</HI></NOTE>. Of all animated beings, the elephant,
the dog, the beaver, and the ape, have the mo&s;t
admirable in&s;tinct. But this in&s;tinct, which is
only a re&s;ult of all the animal powers, both in|ternal
and external, manife&s;ts it&s;elf by very dif|ferent
effects in each of the&s;e &s;pecies. Naturally,
and when left at full liberty, the dog is as cruel
and bloody as the wolf; but, amid&s;t all this fe|rocity
of di&s;po&s;ition, there is one flexible point
which we have cheri&s;hed. Hence the natural
di&s;po&s;itions of the dog differ not from tho&s;e of
other rapacious animals, but by this point of &s;en|&s;ibility,
which renders him &s;u&s;ceptible of affection
and attachment. It is from Nature that he de|rives
<PB N="3" REF="6">
this germ of &s;entiment, which man has
cultivated and expanded by living long and con|&s;tantly
in &s;ociety with this animal. The dog a|lone
was worthy of this di&s;tingui&s;hed regard;
for, being more &s;u&s;ceptible of foreign impre&s;&s;ions
than any other quadruped, all his relative powers
have been brought to perfection by his commerce
with man. His &s;en&s;ibility, his docility, his c$u|rage,
his talents, and even his manners, are mo|dified
and formed by the example and qualities
of his ma&s;ter. We ought not, therefore, to a|&s;cribe
to him all the powers he appears to po&s;&s;e&s;s.
His mo&s;t brilliant qualities are borrowed from
us. He has acquired more than other animals,
becau&s;e he is more capable of making acqui&s;i|tions.
In&s;tead of having a repugnance to man,
he has a natural bias in favour of the human race.
This gentle &s;entiment, which is always alive, is
demonstrated by the de&s;ire of plea&s;ing, and has
produced docility, fidelity, perpetual &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion,
and, at the &s;ame time, the degree of attention
nece&s;&s;ary for acting accordingly, and for giving
ready obedience to all the commands he re|ceives.</P>
<P>The ape, on the contrary, is as untractable as
he is extravagant. His nature, in every point,
is equally &s;tubborn. He has no relative &s;en&s;ibi|lities,
no gratitude, no recollection of good treat|ment
or of benefits received. Aver&s;e to the &s;o|ciety
of man, and to every kind of re&s;traint, he
has a violent propen&s;ity to do every thing that
<PB N="4" REF="7">
is hurtful or di&s;plea&s;ing. But the&s;e real faults
are compen&s;ated by apparent perfections. In his
external figure, he re&s;embles man: He has arms,
hands, and fingers. The u&s;e of the&s;e parts alone
renders him &s;uperior in addre&s;s to other animals;
and the relations they give him to us, in &s;imila|rity
of movements and conformity of actions,
plea&s;e and deceive us, and lead us to a&s;cribe to
internal qualities, what depends &s;olely on the
&s;tructure of his members.</P>
<P>The beaver, who&s;e individual qualities &s;eem
far inferior to tho&s;e of the dog and ape, has, not|with&s;tanding,
received from Nature a gift almo&s;t
equivalent to that of &s;peech. He makes him|&s;elf
&s;o well under&s;tood to his own &s;pecies, that
they unite in &s;ociety, act in concert, undertake
and execute large and long continued works;
and this &s;ocial attachment, as well as the re&s;ult
of their mutual intelligence, are more entitled to
our admiration than the addre&s;s of the ape, or
the fidelity of the dog.</P>
<P>Hence the genius of the dog (if I may be
permitted to profane this term) is borrowed;
the ape has only the appearance of it; and the
talents of the beaver extend no farther than to
what regards him&s;elf and his a&s;&s;ociates. But
the elephant is &s;uperior to all the three; for in
him all their mo&s;t exalted qualities are united.
In the ape, the hand is the principal organ of
addre&s;s. The trunk of the elephant affords him
the &s;ame means of addre&s;s as the ape. It &s;erves
<PB N="5" REF="8">
in&s;tead of an arm and a hand; and by it he is
enabled to rai&s;e and lay hold of &s;mall as well as
large objects, to carry them to his mouth, to
place them on his back, to embrace them fa&s;t,
or to throw them to a di&s;tance. He has, at the
&s;ame time, the docility of the dog, and, like that
animal, he is &s;u&s;ceptible of gratitude, capable of
attachment, is ea&s;ily accu&s;tomed to man, &s;ubmits
le&s;s by force than good treatment, &s;erves him
with zeal, fidelity, knowledge, &amp;c. In fine,
the elephant, like the beaver, loves the &s;ociety
of his equals, and can make him&s;elf to be under|&s;tood
by them. They are often ob&s;erved to a&s;|&s;emble
together, to di&s;per&s;e, and to act in con|cert;
and, if they receive no mutual edification,
if they carry on no common operation, it mu&s;t,
perhaps, be a&s;cribed to the want of room and of
tranquility; for men have been very antiently
multiplied in all the countries inhabited by the
elephant; he is, therefore, perpetually di&s;turb|ed,
and is no where a peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of
&s;ufficient &s;pace to e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;ecure abode. We
have &s;een, that all the&s;e advantages are nece&s;|&s;ary
to unfold the talents of the beaver, and that,
in every place frequented by men, he lo&s;es his
indu&s;try, and receives no edification from a&s;&s;o|ciating.
Every being has its relative value in
Nature. To form a ju&s;t e&s;timation of the ele|phant,
he mu&s;t be allowed to po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;agacity
of the beaver, the addre&s;s of the ape, the &s;entiment
of the dog, together with the peculiar advanta|ges
<PB N="6" REF="9">
of &s;trength, largene&s;s, and long duration of
life. Neither &s;hould we overlook his arms or
tu&s;ks, which enable him to transfix and conquer
the lion. We &s;hould al&s;o con&s;ider, that the earth
&s;hakes under his feet; that with his hand he
tears up trees<NOTE N="&ast;" TYPE="foot">Veteres probo&s;cidem elephanti manum appellaverunt.&mdash;Eadem aliquoties nummum e terra tollentem vidi, et aliquan|do detrahentem arboris ramum, quem viri viginti-quatuor fune trahentes ad humum flectere non potueramus; cum &s;olus elephas tribus vicibus motum detrahebat; <HI>Vartomannus, apud Ge&s;ner. cap. de Elephanto.</HI>&mdash;Silve&s;tres elephanti fagos, olea&s;tros, et palmas dentibus &s;ubvertunt radicitus; <HI>Oppian.</HI>&mdash;Promu&s;cis elephanti naris e&s;t qua cibum, tam &s;iccum quam humidum, ille capiat, $$que perinde ac <HI>manu</HI> admoveat.

effort. But they have greatly exaggerated his
faculties. They have, without he&s;itation, a&s;cri|bed
to him intellectual powers and moral vir|tues.

as they are extremely &s;u&s;picious and &s;en&s;ible of

travellers who frequent the countries inhabited
by elephants, kindle fires during the night, and
beat drums to prevent their approach. When
they have been once attacked by men, or have
fallen into a &s;nare, they are &s;aid never to forget

their &s;en&s;e of &s;melling is, perhaps, more perfect

mo&s;t advanced age, provided the creature enjoys

what changes may be introduced into the tem|perament

and unnatural food. They are ea&s;ily tamed, in|&s;tructed,

are &s;tronger and more intelligent than any other
animal, their &s;ervice is more ready, more exten|&s;ive,

from their &s;ituation is probably never eradicated:
For, though they feel, from time to time, the
mo&s;t lively impre&s;&s;ions of love, they neither in|termix
nor produce in a dome&s;tic &s;tate. Their
con&s;trained pa&s;&s;ion degenerates into fury. Being
unable to gratify them&s;elves without witne&s;&s;es,
they fret, lo&s;e patience, and, at la&s;t, their indig|nation
becomes &s;o violent, that the &s;tronge&s;t
<PB N="17" REF="20">
chains, and fetters of every kind, are nece&s;&s;ary
to repre&s;s their movements, and to break their
rage. Hence they differ from all other dome&s;tic
animals, who are managed by men as if they
had no will of their own. They are not of the
number of tho&s;e born &s;laves, which we propa|gate,
mutilate, or multiply, purely to an&s;wer our
own purpo&s;es. Here the individual alone is a
&s;lave. The &s;pecies remains independent, and
uniformly refu&s;es to augment the &s;tores of their
tyrants. This circum&s;tance &s;hows the elephant
to be endowed with &s;entiments &s;uperior to the
nature of common brutes. To feel the mo&s;t
ardent pa&s;&s;ion, and, at the &s;ame time, to deny
the gratification of it, to experience all the fury
of love, and not to tran&s;gre&s;s the laws of mode|&s;ty,
are, perhaps, the highe&s;t efforts of human
virtue; and yet, in the&s;e maje&s;tic animals, they
are only common and uniform exertions. The
indignation they feel, becau&s;e they cannot be
gratified in &s;ecret, becomes &s;tronger than the
pa&s;&s;ion of love, &s;u&s;pends and de&s;troys the effects
of it, and, at the &s;ame time, excites that fury,
which, during the&s;e paroxy&s;ms, renders them
more dangerous than any wild animal.</P>
<P>We are inclined, were it po&s;&s;ible, to doubt of
this fact; but all naturali&s;ts, hi&s;torians, and tra|vellers,
concur in a&s;&s;uring us, that the elephants

them &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I went to &s;ee the grand hunting of the elephants, which was performed in the following manner: The King &s;ent a great number of women into the woods; and, when the report was brought that they had di&s;covered a troop of ele|phants, he de&s;patched thirty or forty thou&s;and men, who made a large circle round the place. They po&s;ted them&s;elves in fours, at the di&s;tance of twenty or twenty-five feet from each other, and at every &s;tation they kindled a fire, which was rai&s;ed about three feet above the &s;urface of the earth. There was another circle compo&s;ed of elephants trained to war, di&s;tant from one another about a hundred or a hundred and fifty paces; and, in &s;uch places as the wild elephants might mo&s;t ea&s;ily e&s;cape, the war elephants were po&s;ted clo&s;&s;er. There were cannons in &s;everal places, which are di&s;|charged when the wild elephants attempt to force a pa&s;&s;age; for they are terrified at fire. This circle is daily dimini&s;hed, and at la&s;t becomes &s;o &s;mall, that the fires are not above five or &s;ix paces di&s;tant. As the elephants hear a great noi&s;e all round them, they dare not fly, though it is not uncommon for &s;ome of them to make their e&s;cape; for I was told that ten of them got off in one day. When the hunters want to &s;eize them, they are made to enter a place &s;urrounded with &s;takes, where there are al&s;o &s;ome trees, between which a man can ea&s;ily pa&s;s. There is another circle of war elephants and &s;oldiers, into which &s;ome men enter mounted on ele|phants, who are extremely dexterous in throwing ropes round the hind legs of the&s;e animals. When fixed in this manner, the wild elephant is put between two tame elephants, and a third one is appointed to pu&s;h him behind in &s;uch a manner as obliges him to go forward; and, when he grows mi&s;chievous, the others give him blows with their trunks. He is then led off into captivity; and the others are &s;eized in the &s;ame manner. I &s;aw ten of them taken. The King was pre|&s;ent, and gave every nece&s;&s;ary order; <HI>Relation de l'Amba&s;&s;ade de M.

In the mid&s;t of the fore&s;t, and in the
neighbourhood of places frequented by the ele|phants,
a &s;pot is cho&s;en, and &s;urrounded with
&s;trong pali&s;ades. The large&s;t trees of the wood
&s;erve as the principal &s;takes, to which are fixed
cro&s;s bars that &s;upport the other &s;takes. A large
opening is left, through which the elephant may
enter; and over this door there is a trap, or ra|ther
it receives a &s;trong bar, which is &s;hut after
the animal pa&s;&s;es. To draw him into this en|clo&s;ure,
the hunters go in que&s;t of him: They
carry along with them into the fore&s;t a tamed
female in &s;ea&s;on; and, when they imagine them|&s;elves
to be near enough to be heard, her gover|nour
makes her utter the cry of love. The wild
male in&s;tantly replies, and ha&s;tens to join her.
She is then made to march towards the enclo&s;ure,
repeating the cry from time to time. She ar|rives
fir&s;t; and the male, following her by the
&s;cent, enters by the &s;ame port. As &s;oon as he
perceives the hunters, and &s;ees him&s;elf &s;urround|ed,
<PB N="20" REF="23">
his ardour vani&s;hes, and is changed into
fury. Ropes and fetters are thrown round
his legs and trunk. Two or three tamed ele|phants,
conducted by men expert in that bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
are brought to him, and they endeavour to
fix him to one of the animals. In fine, by ad|dre&s;s,
by force, by torture and care&s;&s;es, he is
tamed in a few days. I will not enter into a
more particular detail, but content my&s;elf with
quoting from tho&s;e travellers who have been
eye-witne&s;&s;es of the hunting of elephants,
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>At a quarter of a league from Luovo, there is a kind of large amphitheatre, of a rectangular figure, &s;urrounded with high terra&s;s walls, upon which the &s;pectators are placed.

A large opening is left on the &s;ide next the fields, and, oppo&s;ite to it, next the city, there is a &s;maller one, which leads to a narrow alley, through which an elephant can pa&s;s with difficulty, and this alley terminates in a large &s;hade where the operation of taming is fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>When the day de&s;tined for the chace arrives, the hunters enter the woods, mounted on female elephants trained to this exerci&s;e. The men cover them&s;elves with leaves of trees, to prevent their being ob&s;erved by the wild elephants. When they have advanced into the fore&s;t, and think that &s;ome ele|phants may be in the neighbourhood, they make the females utter certain cries, fitted to allure the males, who in&s;tantly reply by frightful roarings. Then the hunters, when they perceive the elephants at a proper di&s;tance, return, and lead the females gently back toward the amphitheatre above de|&s;cribed. The wild elephants never fail to follow. The male, which we &s;aw tamed, entered the enclo&s;ure &s;pontaneou&s;ly a|long with the females, and the pa&s;&s;age was immediately &s;hut. The females continue their march acro&s;s the amphitheatre, and filed off one by one into the narrow alley at the o|ther end. The wild elephant, who had followed them all along, &s;topt at the entrance of this defile. Every method was tried to make him enter. The females, who were now beyond the alley, were made to cry. Some Siame&s;e irritated him, by clapping their hands, and crying <HI>pat, pat.</HI> Others teazed him with long poles armed with &s;harp points; and, when pur&s;ued, they &s;lip through between the po&s;ts, and conceal them&s;elves behind the pali&s;ade, which the elephant cannot &s;urmount. La&s;tly, after having pur&s;ued &s;everal hunters in vain, he &s;ingles out one, whom he &s;ets upon with extreme fury. This man runs into the narrow alley, and the elephant follows him. But, he no &s;ooner enters than he perceives him&s;elf to be in a &s;nare; for the man e&s;capes, and two portculli&s;es, one before and another behind, are in&s;tantly let fall; &s;o that, being unable either to advance or retreat, the animal makes the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing efforts, and rai&s;es the mo&s;t hideous cries. The hun|ters endeavour to &s;ooth him by throwing pails of water on his body, by rubbing him with leaves, by pouring oil upon his ears, and by bringing to him tamed elephants, both male and female, who care&s;s him with their trunks. They fix ropes, however, round his body and hind legs, to enable them to drag him out, and they continue to throw water on his trunk and body, in order to refre&s;h him. In fine, a tamed elephant, accu&s;tomed to in&s;truct noviciates, is made to approach him. The former is mounted by a &s;ervant, who makes the animal advance and retire, to &s;how the wild elephant that he has no|thing to fear, and that he may go out. The port is then o|pened, and he follows his neighbour to the end of the alley. When there, two elephants are tied, one to each &s;ide of him, another marches before, leads him in the way they want him to go, while a third pu&s;hes him behind with its head, till they arrive at a kind of &s;hade, where he is tied to a large poll, which turns round like the cap&s;tan of a &s;hip. There he is left till next day, to allow his rage to &s;ub&s;ide. But, while he frets around this po&s;t, a Bramin, one of tho&s;e Indian prie&s;ts who are ex|tremely numerous in Siam, dre&s;&s;ed in white, a|pproaches the a|nimal, mounted on an elephant, turns gently round him, and bedews him with a con&s;ecrated water, which the prie&s;t carries in a golden ve&s;&s;el. They believe that, by this ceremony, the elephant lo&s;es his natural ferocity, and is rendered fit for the King's &s;ervice. Next day, he walks along with his en&s;laved neighbours; and, at the end of fifteen days, he is complete|ly tamed; <HI>Premier Voyage du P. Tachard, p.</HI> 298.</P>
<P>They had no &s;ooner alighted from their hor&s;es, and mounted the elephants which were prepared for them, than the King ap|peared, accompanied with a great number of Mandarins, riding on elephants of war. They all proceeded about a league into the wood, when they arrived at the place where the wild ele|phants were enclo&s;ed. This was a &s;quare park, of three or four hundred geometrical paces, the &s;ides of which were fenced with large &s;takes; in which, however, con&s;iderable openings were left at certain di&s;tances. It contained fourteen large elephants. As &s;oon as the royal train arrived, a circle was formed, con&s;i&s;ting of a hundred war elephants, which were placed round the park to prevent the wild ones from forcing through the pali&s;ades. We were &s;tationed behind this fence, near the King. A dozen of the &s;tronge&s;t tame elephants were pu&s;hed into the park, each of them being mounted by two men, furni&s;hed with large ropes and noo&s;es, the ends of which were fixed to the elephants they rode. They fir&s;t ran again&s;t the elephant they wi&s;hed to &s;eize, who, &s;eeing him&s;elf pur&s;ued, endeavoured to force the barrier and make his e&s;cape. But the whole was blockaded by the war-elephants, who pu&s;hed him back; and, in his cour&s;e, the hunters, mounted on the tame elephants, threw their noo&s;es fo dexterou&s;ly upon the &s;pots where it behoved the animal to place his feet, that the whole were &s;eized in the &s;pace of an hour. Each elephant was then bound with ropes, and two tame ones placed on each &s;ide of him, by means of which, he is tamed in fifteen days; <HI>Idem, p.</HI> 340.</P>
<P>A few days after, we had the plea&s;ure of being pre&s;ent at the hunting of elephants. The Siame&s;e are very dexterous at this &s;pecies of hunting, which they have &s;everal modes of perform|ing. The ea&s;ie&s;t, and not the lea&s;t entertaining, is executed by means of female elephants. When a female is in &s;ea&s;on, &s;he is conducted to the fore&s;t of Luovo, Her guide rides on her back, and covers him&s;elf with leaves, to prevent his being perceived by the wild elephants. The cries of the tame female, which &s;he never fails to &s;et up upon a certain &s;ignal given by the guide, collect all the elephants within the reach of hearing, who &s;oon follow her. The guide, taking advantage of their mutual cries, returns &s;lowly toward Luovo with all his train, and enters an enclo&s;ure made of large &s;takes, about a quarter of a league from the city, and pretty near the fore&s;t. A great troop of elephants were, in this manner, brought together; but one of them only was large, and it was very difficult to &s;eize and to tame him.&mdash;The guide who conducted the female went out of the enclo&s;ure by a narrow pa&s;&s;age, in the form of an alley, and about the length of an elephant. Each end of this alley was provided with a portcullis, which was ea&s;ily rai&s;ed or let down. All the young elephants followed the female at different times. But a pa&s;&s;age &s;o narrow alarmed the large one, who always drew back. The female was made to return &s;everal times; he uni|formly followed her to the port; but, as if he &s;ore&s;aw his lo&s;s of liberty, he would never pa&s;s. Several Siame&s;e, who were in the park, then advanced, and endeavoured to force him, by goading him with &s;harp pointed poles. The elephant, being en|raged by this treatment, pur&s;ued them with &s;uch fury and quick|ne&s;s, that not one of them would have e&s;caped, had they not nimbly retired behind the &s;takes of the pali&s;ade, again&s;t which the ferocious creature broke its large tu&s;ks three or four times. In the heat of the pur&s;uit, one of tho&s;e who attacked him mo&s;t bri&s;kly, and who was mo&s;t keenly pur&s;ued, run into the alley, which the elephant entered, in order to kill him. But the ani|mal no &s;ooner fell into the &s;nare, than the Siame&s;e e&s;caped by a &s;mall pa&s;&s;age, and the two portculli&s;es were in&s;tantly let down. The elephant &s;truggled much; but he found him&s;elf obliged to remain in his pri&s;on. To appea&s;e him, they threw pailfulls of water on his body. Ropes, however, were put round his legs and neck. After being fatigued for &s;ome time, he was brought out by means of two tame elephants who drew him forward with ropes, while other two pu&s;hed him behind, till he was fixed to a large post, round which he could only turn. In an hour after, he became &s;o tractable, that a Siame&s;e mounted on his back; and next day he was let loo&s;e, and conducted to the &s;tables along with the others; <HI>Second voyage du P.

When the elephant enters, the hunters, from the top of a tree, draw up the door, by means of a rope. They then de&s;cend and &s;lay the animal with arrows.

In &s;ome places, caltrops are &s;pread on the ground, by means of which the animals fall into ditches, from whence, after being properly entangled, they are ea&s;ily drawn out. In others, a tame female is led into a narrow defile, and allures the male to approach by her cries. When he arrives, the hunt|ers &s;hut him up by barriers, which they have in readine&s;s for the purpo&s;e; and, though he finds the female on her back, he copulates with her, contrary to the practice of other quadru|peds. After this, he endeavours to retire. But, while he goes about in que&s;t of an outlet, the hunters, who are upon a wall, or &s;ome elevated &s;ituation, throw ropes and chains of different dimen&s;ions, by which they &s;o entangle his trunk and the re&s;t of his body, that they can approach him without danger; and, af|ter taking &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary precautions, they carry him off, ac|companied with two tame elephants, to &s;how him a proper ex|ample, or to cha&s;ti&s;e him if he rebels.&mdash;There are many o|ther methods of hunting elephants; for every country has its own mode; <HI>Relation d'un voyage par Thevenot, tom. 3. p.</HI> 131.&mdash;The inhabitants of Ceylon dig pretty deep ditches, which they cover with thin planks and &s;traw.

<P>After comparing the te&s;timonies of travellers
and hi&s;torians, it appears that elephants are more
<PB N="37" REF="40">
numerous and common in Africa than in A&s;ia.
They are al&s;o le&s;s &s;u&s;picious, and retire not to
&s;uch di&s;tant &s;olitudes. They &s;eem to know the
un&s;kilfulne&s;s and debility of the men who inha|bit

They treat the Negroes with
that natural and &s;upercilious indifference which
they entertain for all animals. They regard
not man as a powerful or formidable being, but
as a crafty creature, who knows only how to
lay &s;nares in their way, but who dare not attack
them face to face, and is ignorant of the art of
reducing them to &s;lavery, It is by this art alone,
which has been long known in the Ea&s;tern na|tions,
that the number of the&s;e animals has been
dimini&s;hed. The wild elephants, which the&s;e
people render dome&s;tic, become by captivity &s;o
many voluntary eunuchs, in whom the &s;ources
of generation are daily dried up. But, in
Africa, where the elephants are all free, the
&s;pecies is &s;upported, and might even increa&s;e,
though more of them were de&s;troyed; becau&s;e
every individual is con&s;tantly labouring to re|pair
the wa&s;te. I perceive no other cau&s;e to
which this difference of number can be a&s;cribed;
for it appears, from every consideration, that the
<PB N="38" REF="41">
&s;outh of India and the Ea&s;t of Africa, are the
countries mo&s;t congenial to the nature of the
elephant. He is there much larger and &s;trong|er
than in Guiney, or any other we&s;tern region
of Africa. He dreads exce&s;&s;ive heat, and never
inhabits the burning &s;ands of the de&s;ert. Nei|ther
is the &s;pecies &s;o numerous in the country of
the Negroes, as along the rivers; and they are
never found in the mountainous parts of Afri|ca.
But, in India, the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t coura|geous
of the &s;pecies, and which have the large&s;t
tu&s;ks, are called <HI>Mountain Elephants:</HI> They in|habit
the elevated parts of the country, where,
the air being more temperate, the waters le&s;s

is capable.</P>
<P>In general, the elephants of A&s;ia exceed, in
&s;ize, &s;trength, &amp;c. tho&s;e of Africa; and tho&s;e
of Ceylon, in particular, are &s;uperior to all tho&s;e

tho&s;e of India.</P>
<P>The &s;trength of the&s;e animals is proportioned
to their magnitude. The Indian elephants carry

He draws up into his trunk one hundred and fifty pounds of water, which he &s;quirts to a con&s;iderable height in the air; <HI>L'Afrique de Marmol. tom. 1. p.</HI> 58.</NOTE>. They draw
up into their trunks large quantities of water,
which they &s;quirt into the air, or all around, to

a weight of above a thou&s;and pounds on their
tu&s;ks. They u&s;e their trunk for breaking bran|ches,
and their tu&s;ks for tearing up trees. The
greatne&s;s of their &s;trength may be &s;till farther
conceived from the quickne&s;s of their move|ments,
compared with the magnitude of their
bodies. At their ordinary &s;tep, they cut as
much ground as a hor&s;e at a gentle trot; and
they run as fa&s;t as a hor&s;e can gallop: But, in
a &s;tate of liberty, they never run, unle&s;s when
enraged or terrified. Dome&s;tic elephants are
generally walked, and they perform ea&s;ily, and
without fatigue, a journey of fifteen or twenty
leagues in a day; and, when pu&s;hed, they can
travel thirty or forty leagues a-day<NOTE N="&Dagger;" TYPE="foot">When an elephant is pu&s;hed, he can perform, in one day, as much as a man generally does in &s;ix; <HI>L'Afrique de Marmol. tom. 1. p.</HI> 58.</NOTE>. Their

which co&s;t about four francs, or a hundred

They require rice well boiled, and &s;ea&s;oned with butter and &s;ugar, which is given to them in large balls. They devour daily a hundred pounds of rice, be&s;ide leaves of trees, particularly tho&s;e of the Indian fig, called <HI>bananas</HI> or <HI>plantane,</HI> which are given them by way of refre&s;hment; <HI>Voyage de Pyrard, tom. 2. p.</HI> 367.&mdash;See al&s;o, <HI>Voyages de la Boullaye-le-Gouz, p.</HI> 250;&mdash;and <HI>Recueil des voyages de la Compagnie des Indes de Hollande, tom, 1. p.</HI> 473.</NOTE>. He is generally fed with rice,
raw or boiled, and mixed with water. To keep
him in full vigour, he is &s;aid to require daily a
hundred pounds of rice, be&s;ide fre&s;h herbage to
cool him; for he is &s;ubject to be over-heated,
and mu&s;t be led to the water twice or thrice a
day for the benefit of bathing. He ea&s;ily learns
to bathe him&s;elf. He takes the water up in his
trunk, carries it to his mouth, drinks part of it,
and, by elevating his trunk, allows the remain|der
to run over every part of his body. To
<PB N="42" REF="45">
give an idea of the labour he performs, it is &s;uf|ficient
to remark, that all the tuns, &s;acks, and
bales, tran&s;ported from one place to another in
India, are carried by elephants; that they carry
burdens on their bodies, their necks, their tu&s;ks,
and even in their mouths, by giving them the
end of a rope, which they hold fa&s;t with their
teeth; that, uniting &s;agacity to &s;trength, they
never break or injure any thing committed to
their charge; that, from the margins of the wa|ters,
they put the&s;e bundles into boats without
wetting them, laying them down gently, and ar|ranging
them where they ought to be placed;
that, when di&s;po&s;ed in the places where their
ma&s;ters direct, they try with their trunk whether
the goods are properly &s;towed; and, if a tun or
ca&s;k rolls, they go, of their own accord, in que&s;t
of &s;tones to prop and render it firm.</P>
<P>When the elephant is properly managed,
though in captivity, he lives a long time; and,
it is probable, that, in a &s;tate of liberty, his life
is &s;till longer. Some authors affirm, that he

The keepers of the&s;e animals can give no other information, than that &s;uch an elephant was in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their father, grandfather, and great-grand|father; and, by computing the length of time which the&s;e people lived, it is &s;ometimes found to amount to a hundred and twenty, or a hundred and thirty years; <HI>Voyage de Taver|nier, tom. 3. p.</HI> 242.</NOTE>. I believe, that a medium between
the two extremes is the truth; and that, if cap|tive
elephants live a hundred and twenty, or a
hundred and thirty years, tho&s;e which are free,
and enjoy all the conveniencies and rights
of Nature, ought to exi&s;t at lea&s;t two hun|dred.
Be&s;ides, if they go two years with young,
and require thirty before they obtain their full
growth, we may, with &s;till more certainty, con|clude,
that their life extends beyond the period
we have affixed. But captivity abridges their
exi&s;tence le&s;s than the injuries ari&s;ing from
change of climate. Whatever care is be&s;towed
on him, the elephant lives not long in tempe|rate,
and &s;till &s;horter in cold countries. That

old, died in the month of January 1681, at the
age of &s;eventeen, and lived at Ver&s;ailles only
thirteen years, though he was &s;ed plentifully, and
managed with the greate&s;t attention. He had
daily eighty pounds of bread, twelve pints of
wine, and two pails of pottage, mixed with four
or five pounds of bread; and, every &s;econd day,
in place of pottage, he had two pails of boiled
rice, without reckoning what was given him by
vi&s;itors. He had, be&s;ides, a &s;heaf of corn every
day for his amu&s;ement; for, after eating the
ears, he made a kind of whip of the &s;traw, with
which he drove away the flies. He delighted in
breaking the &s;traw into &s;mall mor&s;els, which he
did very dexterou&s;ly with his trunk; and, as he
was daily led out to walk, he pulled and eat the
gra&s;s. The elephant which was lately at Naples,
though the heat is greater there than in France, lived
but a few years. Tho&s;e which were &s;ent to Pe|ter&s;burg,
though well &s;heltered, clothed, and
warmed with &s;toves, all died &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. Hence
we may conclude, that this animal is incapable
of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, and far le&s;s can he multiply, in
any part of Europe. But I am a&s;toni&s;hed that
the Portugue&s;e, who fir&s;t knew the value and
utility of elephants in the Ea&s;t Indies, did not
tran&s;port them to the warm climate of Bra&s;il,
where, by leaving them at liberty, they would
<PB N="45" REF="48">
probably have multiplied. The elephants are
generally a&s;h-coloured, or blacki&s;h. White ele|phants,
as formerly remarked, are extremely
rare<NOTE N="&ast;" TYPE="foot">Some per&s;ons who lived long in Pondicherry, &s;eem to doubt the exi&s;tence of white and red elephants; for they af|firm, that, in this part of India, at lea&s;t, the elephants are all black. It is true, they remark, that, when the&s;e animals are long neglected to be wa&s;hed, the du&s;t which adheres to their oily and naked &s;kin gives them the appearance of a dirty gray colour; but, when wa&s;hed with water, they become as black as formerly. I believe that black is the natural colour of elephants, and none of any other colour are to be found in tho&s;e parts of India which the&s;e people have had an oppor|tunity of &s;eeing. But, at the &s;ame time, it &s;eems not to admit of a doubt, that, in Ceylon, Siam, Pegu, Cambaya, &amp;c. &s;ome white and red elephants are accidentally to be met with. For ocular witne&s;&s;es of this fact, we might quote le Chevalier Chaumont, l'Abb&egrave; le Choi&s;y, le P. Tachard, Vander Hagen, Joo&s;t Schuten, Thevenot, Ogilvy, and other travellers of le&s;s note. Hortenfels, who has collected, in his <HI>Elephantographia,</HI> a great number of facts from different voyages, a&s;&s;ures us, that the white elephant has not only a white &s;kin, but that the hair of its tail is al&s;o white. To the&s;e te&s;timonies, we might add the authority of the antients. Aelian, lib. 3. cap. 46. mentions a &s;mall white elephant in India, and &s;eems to in&s;i|nuate that the mother was black. This variety in the colour of elephants, though rare, is certain, and very antient. It has, perhaps, proceeded from their dome&s;tic condition, to which the Indians have been long accu&s;tomed to reduce the&s;e ani|mals.</NOTE>; and authors are quoted who have &s;een
white and red elephants in different parts of In|dia,

the&s;e varieties are &s;o uncommon, that, in&s;tead of

accidental; for, if it were otherwi&s;e, we would

In fine, P. Vincent is the only author who &s;ays,
<PB N="47" REF="50">
that the white elephants are the large&s;t. P.
Tachard, on the contrary, a&s;&s;ures us, that the
King of Siam's white elephant was diminutive,
though very old. After comparing the te&s;timo|nies
of travellers with regard to the magnitude
of elephants in different climates, to me it ap|pears,
that the &s;malle&s;t are tho&s;e of the we&s;t and
north of Africa, and that the antients, who knew
only the northern part of Africa, were right in
their general a&s;&s;ertion, that the Indian elephants
were much larger than tho&s;e of Africa. But, in
the ea&s;tern regions of this quarter of the world,
of which the antients were ignorant, the ele|phants
are as large, and perhaps larger than
tho&s;e of India. In this la&s;t region, it appears,
that the elephants of Siam, Pegu, &amp;c. are larger
than tho&s;e of Ceylon; which, however, from the
unanimous te&s;timony of travellers, have more
courage and intelligence.</P>
<P>Having thus marked the principal facts with
regard to the &s;pecies, let us next examine, in
detail, the properties of the individual, his &s;en&s;es,
movements, &s;ize, &s;trength, addre&s;s, &s;agacity, &amp;c.
In proportion to the magnitude of his body,
the eyes of the elephant are very &s;mall; but
they are lively and brilliant: What di&s;tin|gui&s;hes
them from the eyes of all other animals,
is a pathetic expre&s;&s;ion of &s;entiment, and an
almo&s;t rational management of all their actions<NOTE N="&ast;" TYPE="foot">Elephantographia Chri&s;tophori Petri ab Hartenfels.</NOTE>.
He turns them &s;lowly and with mildne&s;s towards
<PB N="48" REF="51">
his ma&s;ter. When he &s;peaks, the animal re|gards
him with an eye of friend&s;hip and atten|tion,
and his penetrating a&s;pect is con&s;picuous
when he wants to anticipate the inclination of
his governour. He &s;eems to reflect, to deli|berate,
to think, and never determines till he
has &s;everal times examined, without pa&s;&s;ion or
precipitation, the &s;igns which he ought to obey.
The dog, who&s;e eyes are very expre&s;&s;ive, is too
prompt and vivacious to allow us to di&s;tingui&s;h
with ea&s;e the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;hades of his &s;en&s;ations.
But, as the elephant is naturally grave and mo|derate,
we read in his eyes, who&s;e movements
are &s;low, the order and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of his inter|nal
affections<NOTE N="&ast;" TYPE="foot">The eyes of the elephant are, proportionally, exceed|ingly &s;mall; but they are very active and lively, and they uniformly move in &s;uch a manner, as gives him the air of thought and reflection; <HI>Voyage au Indes Orientales du P. Fr. Vincent Marie de St Catherine de Sienne, p.</HI> 396.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>His ear is very good; and the external organ
of hearing, like that of &s;melling, is more re|markable
in the elephant than in any other ani|mal.
His ears are very large, and much longer,
even in proportion to his body, than tho&s;e of
the a&s;s. They lie flat on the head, like the hu|man
ears. They are commonly pendulous;
but he can rai&s;e and move them with &s;uch fa|cility,
that he u&s;es them to defend his eyes from
du&s;t and flies<NOTE N="&dagger;" TYPE="foot">The elephant has very large ears.... He perpetually moves them with much gravity, and they defend his eyes from all kinds of in&s;ects; <HI>Id. ibid......</HI> See al&s;o <HI>Les Memoires p$ur &s;ervir &agrave; l'hi&s;toire des Animaux part. 3. p.</HI> 107.</NOTE>. He delights in the &s;ound of
<PB N="49" REF="52">
musical in&s;truments, and moves in cadence to
the trumpet and tabour. His &s;en&s;e of &s;melling
is exqui&s;ite, and he is pa&s;&s;ionately fond of per|fumes
of every kind, and e&s;pecially of odorife|rous
flowers, which he gathers one by one,
makes no&s;egays of them, and, after gratifying
his no&s;e, conveys them to his mouth. The
flowers of the orange con&s;titute one of his mo&s;t
delicious mor&s;els. With his trunk he robs an
orange tree of all its verdure, eating the fruit,
the flowers, the leaves, and even the &s;mall
branches<NOTE N="&ast;" TYPE="foot">Voyage de Guin&egrave;e, par Bo&s;man, p. 243.</NOTE>. In the meadows, he &s;elects the
mo&s;t odoriferous plants; and, in the woods, he
prefers the cocoa, the banana, the palm, and the
&s;ago trees; and, as the&s;e trees are &s;oft and ten|der,
he eats not only the leaves and fruit, but
even the branches, the trunk, and the roots;
for when they are unable to pull up the trees
with their trunk, they always &s;ucceed by u&s;ing
their tu&s;ks.</P>
<P>With regard to the &s;en&s;e of touching, it is
chiefly confined to the trunk; but, in this mem|ber,
it is as delicate and di&s;tinct as in the hu|man
hand. The trunk is compo&s;ed of mem|branes,
nerves, and mu&s;cles; it is both an or|gan
of feeling and of motion. The animal can|not
only move and bend it, but he can contract,
lengthen, and turn it on all &s;ides. The ex|tremity
of the trunk terminates in a protube|rance<NOTE N="&ast;" TYPE="foot">Mem. pour &s;ervir a l'hi&s;toire des animaux, part. 3. p. 108. &amp; 140.</NOTE>
<PB N="50" REF="53">
which &s;tretches out on the upper &s;ide in
the form of a finger, by means of which the
elephant performs all that we do with our fin|gers.
He lifts from the ground the &s;malle&s;t
piece of money; he &s;elects the herbs and flowers,
and picks them up one by one; he unties the
knots of ropes, opens and &s;huts gates, by turning
the keys, or pu&s;hing back the bolts. He learns
to trace regular characters with an in&s;trument
as &s;mall as a quill<NOTE N="&dagger;" TYPE="foot">Mutianus ter Con&s;ul auctor e&s;t, aliquem ex his et litte|rarum ductus Graecarum didici&s;&s;e, &s;olitumque prae&s;cribere ejus linguae verbis: Ip&s;e ego haec &s;crip&s;i, &amp;c.; <HI>Plin.

Anim. lib. 2. cap.</HI> 11,</NOTE>. It cannot be denied that
the elephant's hand has &s;everal advantages o|ver
ours. It is equally flexible, and as dex|terous
in touching or laying hold of objects.
The&s;e operations are performed by means of
the appendix or finger, &s;ituated on the &s;uperior
part of the border that &s;urrounds the extremity
of the trunk, in the middle of which there is a
concavity in the form of a cup, and in the bottom
of the cup are the apertures of the two common
canals of &s;melling and of re&s;piration. The ele|phant,
therefore, has his no&s;e in his hand, and
is enabled to combine the power of his lungs
with the action of his fingers, and to attract
<PB N="51" REF="54">
fluids by a &s;trong &s;uction, or to rai&s;e heavy bo|dies
by applying to them the edge of his trunk,
and making a vacuum within by a vigorous in|&s;piration.</P>
<P>Hence delicacy of feeling, acutene&s;s of &s;melling,
facility of movement, and the power of &s;uction,
are united at the extremity of the elephant's no&s;e.
Of all the in&s;truments which Nature has &s;o liberally
be&s;towed on her mo&s;t favourite productions, the
trunk of the elephant is perhaps the mo&s;t com|plete
and the mo&s;t admirable. It is not only
an organic in&s;trument, but a triple &s;en&s;e, who&s;e
united functions are at once the cau&s;e, and pro|duce
the effects of that &s;agacity and tho&s;e re|markable
talents which di&s;tingui&s;h the elephant,
and exalt him above all other quadrupeds. He is
not &s;o &s;ubject, as other animals, to errors of
vi&s;ion; becau&s;e he quickly rectifies them by
the &s;en&s;e of touching; and, by u&s;ing his trunk,
as a long arm, for the purpo&s;e of touching re|mote
objects, he acquires, like man, clear ideas
of di&s;tances. But the other animals, excepting
the monkeys and others who have a kind of
arms and hands, cannot acquire ideas of di&s;tance
but by traver&s;ing &s;pace with their bodies. Of
all the &s;en&s;es, that of touching has the greate&s;t
relation to intelligence. The delicacy of touch|ing,
the flexibility of the trunk, the power of
&s;uction, the &s;en&s;e of &s;melling, and the length
of the arm, give the ideas of the &s;ub&s;tance of
bodies, of their external form, of their weight,
<PB N="52" REF="55">
of their &s;alutary or noxious qualities, and of
their di&s;tance. Thus, by the &s;ame members,
and by one &s;imultaneous act, the elephant feels,
perceives, and judges of &s;everal things at one
time. Now a multiplied &s;en&s;ation is equivalent,
in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to reflection: Though this
animal, therefore, is, like all others, deprived of
the faculty of reflecting, as his &s;en&s;ations are
combined in the &s;ame organ, contemporary, and
not &s;eparated from each other, it is not &s;urpri|&s;ing
that he &s;hould have ideas of his own, and
readily acquire tho&s;e we wi&s;h to communicate to
him. The memory of the elephant &s;hould be
more perfect than that of any other animal; for
memory depends greatly on the circum&s;tances
of actions. No &s;olitary &s;en&s;ation, however lively,
can leave any di&s;tinct or durable impre&s;&s;ion;
but &s;everal combined and contemporary &s;en&s;ations
make deep and la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ions; &s;o that, if
the elephant cannot recollect an idea by touch
alone, the adjacent and acce&s;&s;ory &s;en&s;ations of
&s;melling, and the power of &s;uction, which have
acted at the &s;ame time, aids him in recalling
the remembrance of it. In man, the be&s;t mode
of rendering the memory faithful, is to employ
&s;ucce&s;&s;ively all our &s;en&s;es in examining an ob|ject;
and it is owing to the neglect of habi|tuating
our&s;elves to the combined u&s;e of our
&s;en&s;es, that we forget mo&s;t things we ought
to remember.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="56">
But, though the elephant has more memo|ry
and intelligence than any other animal, his
brain is proportionally &s;maller than that of mo&s;t
quadrupeds<NOTE N="&ast;" TYPE="foot">Mem. pour &s;ervir &aacute; l'hi&s;t. des animaux, part. 3. p. 135.</NOTE>. I mention this fact as a proof
that the brain is not the &s;eat of &s;en&s;ation, the
<HI>&s;en&s;orium commune,</HI> which, on the contrary, re|&s;ides
in the nerves of the &s;en&s;es, and in the mem|branes
of the head. Thus the nerves di&s;tri|buted
upon the trunk of the elephant, are &s;o
numerous as to be equivalent to all tho&s;e be|&s;towed
on the re&s;t of the body. It is, there|fore,
by virtue of this &s;ingular combination of
&s;en&s;es and faculties in the trunk, that the ele|phant
excells all other animals in &s;agacity, not|with&s;tanding
the enormity of his ma&s;s, and the
di&s;proportion of his form; for the elephant is,
at the &s;ame time, a miracle of intelligence and
a mon&s;ter of matter. The thickne&s;s and inflexi|bility
of his body; the &s;hortne&s;s and &s;tiffne&s;s of
his neck; the &s;mallne&s;s and deformity of his
head; the exce&s;&s;ive largene&s;s of his ears and
no&s;e; the minutene&s;s of his eyes, mouth, genitals,
and tail; his &s;traight, clum&s;y, and almo&s;t in|flexible
limbs; the &s;hortne&s;s and &s;mallne&s;s of
his feet<NOTE N="&dagger;" TYPE="foot">The feet of every animal is proportionally larger than that of man, excepting the elephant, which is &s;till &s;maller.&mdash;The feet were &s;o &s;mall as to be hardly perceptible; becau&s;e the toes are covered with the &s;kin of the legs, which hangs down on all &s;ides as far as the ground, and appears like the trunk of a tree cut acro&s;s: <HI>Mem. pour &s;ervir &agrave; Phi&s;t. des animaux, p.</HI> 102.</NOTE>, which are hardly apparent; the thick|ne&s;s
<PB N="54" REF="57">
and callo&s;ity of his &s;kin: All the&s;e de|formities
are the more con&s;picuous and di&s;agree|able
to the eye, becau&s;e they are modelled
on a large &s;cale, and mo&s;t of them peculiar
to the elephant alone; for in no animal are
the head, the feet, the no&s;e, the ears, and the
tu&s;ks, &s;ituated like tho&s;e of the elephant.</P>
<P>From this &s;trange conformation, the animal is
&s;ubjected to &s;everal inconveniencies. He moves
his head with difficulty, and cannot turn him|&s;elf,
in order to go back, without making a cir|cuit.
The hunters who attack him behind, or
on the flanks, avoid the effects of his vengeance
by circular movements; and they have time to
renew their blows while he is turning him&s;elf
again&s;t them. His legs, the rigidity of which is
not &s;o great as that of his neck and body, bend
but &s;lowly, and with difficulty. They are &s;trong|ly
articulated to the thighs. His knee is like
that of man<NOTE N="&ast;" TYPE="foot">His knee is &s;ituated, like that of man, in the middle between the belly and the foot; &s;o that the elephant's leg is &s;imilar to a man's, both with regard to the po&s;ition of the knee and the &s;mallne&s;s of the foot, the extent of which, from the heel to the toes, is very &s;mall; <HI>Mem. pour &s;ervir a l'hi&s;t. des animaux, part. 3. p.</HI> 102.</NOTE>, and his foot is equally low; but
the latter has no extent, &s;pring, or force, and the
former is hard and rigid. As long, however, as
the elephant is young and in health, he bends
his knees to lie down, and to allow him&s;elf to be
mounted, or charged with a load. But, when
old or &s;ick, this movement becomes &s;o laborious,

if forced to lie down<NOTE N="&ast;" TYPE="foot">We learned from the people who had the charge of the elephant at Ver&s;ailles, formerly mentioned, that, the fir&s;t eight years he lived, he lay down and ro&s;e with great facility; and that, during the la&s;t five years, he did not lie down to &s;leep, but leaned again&s;t the wall of his apartment; &s;o that, if he had hap|pened to lie down when &s;ick, it would have been nece&s;&s;ary to pierce the floor above, in order to rai&s;e him with engines; <HI>Mem. pour &s;ervir &agrave; l'hi&s;t. des animaux, p.</HI> 104.</NOTE>, machines are nece&s;&s;ary
to rai&s;e him. His tu&s;ks, which, with age, be|come
enormou&s;ly heavy, and not being placed,
like the horns of other animals, in a vertical po|&s;ition,
form two long levers, which, by their al|mo&s;t
horizontal direction, fatigue the head pro|digiou&s;ly,
and make it hang down; &s;o that the
animal is &s;ometimes obliged to make holes in the
wall of his lodge to &s;upport them, and relieve
him of their weight<NOTE N="&dagger;" TYPE="foot">We &s;aw where the elephant had employed his tu&s;ks in ma|king holes in a &s;tone-pillar, which projected from the wall of his lodge, and the&s;e holes &s;upported him when &s;leeping, his tu&s;ks being put into them; <HI>Id. p.</HI> 102.</NOTE>. He has the di&s;advantage
of having the organ of &s;melling very di&s;tant from
that of ta&s;ting, and the inconvenience of not be|ing
able to &s;eize any thing on the ground with
his mouth, becau&s;e his neck is too &s;tiff and too
&s;hort to allow his head to reach the earth. He
is, therefore, obliged to lay hold of his food,
and even of his drink, with his no&s;e, and then
to convey it, not only to the entrance of his
mouth, but as far as the throat; and, when the
trunk is filled with water, he thru&s;ts the end of
<PB N="56" REF="59">
it to the very root of the tongue<NOTE N="&ast;" TYPE="foot">Mem. pour &s;ervir &agrave; l'hi&s;t. des animaux, part 3. p. 109.</NOTE>, &s;eemingly
with the intention of pu&s;hing back the epiglottis
to prevent the water, which ru&s;hes out with im|petuo&s;ity,
from entering into the larynx; for he
forces out the water by the &s;ame air which he
employed to &s;uck it up, and it ru&s;hes out of the
trunk with noi&s;e, and precipitantly enters the
gullet. The tongue, the mouth, and the lips,
are of no u&s;e to him, as in other animals, to &s;uck
or lap his drink.</P>
<P>From this de&s;cription, the &s;ingular con&s;equence
re&s;ults, that the young elephant mu&s;t &s;uck with
its no&s;e, and afterwards convey the milk to its
gullet. We are told, however, by the antients,
that he &s;ucks with his mouth, and not with his
trunk<NOTE N="&dagger;" TYPE="foot">Pullus editus ore &s;ugit, non promu&s;cide, et &s;tatim cum na|tus e&s;t cernit et ambulat; <HI>Ari&s;t. hi&s;t. anim. lib. 6. cap.</HI> 27.&mdash;Anni|culo qoidem vitulo aequalem pullum edit elephantus, qui &s;tatim, ut natus e&s;t, ore &s;ugit; <HI>Aelian. de nat. anim. lib. 6. cap.</HI> 3.</NOTE>. But there is rea&s;on to believe that they
never were witne&s;&s;es of the fact, and that they
rea&s;oned &s;olely from the analogy of other animals.
If the young elephant ever acquired the habit of
&s;ucking with his mouth, why &s;hould he lo&s;e it
during the re&s;t of his life? Why does he never
employ the mouth to &s;uck in water? Why does
he uniformly employ a double action, when a
&s;ingle one would an&s;wer the purpo&s;e? Why does
he never &s;eize any object with his mouth, ex|cept
<PB N="57" REF="60">
what is thrown into it when open<NOTE N="&ast;" TYPE="foot">Voyez les Memoires pour &s;ervir &agrave; l'hi&s;t. des Animaux, part, 3. p. 109. et 110.</NOTE>? It is,
therefore, extremely probable, that the young e|lephant
&s;ucks only with his trunk. This pre|&s;umption
is not only proved by the following
facts, but is founded on a &s;tronger analogy than
that which gave ri&s;e to the opinion of the an|tients.
We formerly remarked, that, in general
animals, at the moment of birth, can perceive
the pre&s;ence of the aliment they want by no o|ther
&s;en&s;e but that of &s;melling. The ear can
have no effect; neither can the eye; for mo&s;t
animals are blind when they begin to &s;uck. The
&s;en&s;e of touching can only convey a vague and
indi&s;criminate notion of all the parts of the mo|ther's
body, or, rather, it can indicate nothing
relative to appetite. But the &s;en&s;e of &s;melling
is alone &s;ufficient for this purpo&s;e: It is not on|ly
a &s;pecies of ta&s;te, but a fore-ta&s;te, which pre|cedes,
accompanies, and determines the other kind.
The elephant, therefore, like all other animals,
perceives, by this fore-ta&s;te, the pre&s;ence of his ali|ment:
And, as the &s;eat of &s;melling is united with
the power of &s;uction at the extremity of the trunk,
he applies it to the teat, &s;ucks the milk, and con|veys
it to the mouth to &s;atisfy his appetite. Be|&s;ides,
the two paps, as in woman, are &s;ituated on
the brea&s;t, and, the teats being very &s;mall in pro|portion
to the &s;ize of the young one's mouth,
<PB N="58" REF="61">
who&s;e neck al&s;o has little flexibility, the mother
mu&s;t have lain on her back or &s;ide to enable her
young to lay hold of the teat with its mouth;
and, even in this &s;ituation, it would have been
difficult to extract the milk, on account of the
enormous di&s;proportion between the largene&s;s of
the mouth and the &s;mallne&s;s of the teat. But
the margin of the trunk, which the animal con|tracts
at plea&s;ure, is ea&s;ily accommodated to the
teat, and enables the young elephant to &s;uck the
mother either when &s;he &s;tands or lies on her &s;ide.
Thus every circum&s;tance concurs in invalidating
the notion of the antients on this &s;ubject; for
none of them, nor even any of the moderns, al|ledge
that they ever &s;aw the elephant &s;ucking;
and I have no he&s;itation in predicting, that,
whenever &s;uch an ob&s;ervation is made, it will
appear, that he &s;ucks not with his mouth, but
with his no&s;e. I likewi&s;e imagine that the an|tients
are deceived, when they tell us, that the
elephants copulate like other quadrupeds, the
female only lowering her crupper<NOTE N="&ast;" TYPE="foot">Sub&s;idit foemina, clunibu&s;que &s;ubmi&s;&s;is, et in&s;i&s;tit pedibus ac innititur; mas &s;uperveniens comprimit, atque ita munere vene|reo fungitur; <HI>Ari&s;t. hi&s;t. anim, lib.</HI> 5. cap. 2.</NOTE>, for the more
ea&s;y reception of the male. The &s;ituation of the
parts &s;eems to render this mode of junction im|po&s;&s;ible.
The female elephant has not, like o|ther
quadrupeds, the orifice of the vagina adja|cent
to the anus; for it is &s;ituated nearly in the
middle of the belly, about two and a half, or
<PB N="59" REF="62">
three feet di&s;tant from the anus<NOTE N="&ast;" TYPE="foot">Mem. pour &s;ervir &agrave; I'hi&s;t. des animaux, part&punc; 3. p. 132.</NOTE>. On the other
hand, the male organ is by no means propor|tioned
to the magnitude of his body, nor to &s;o
long an interval, which, in the &s;ituation &s;uppo|&s;ed,
would preclude the practicability of his ap|proach.
Naturali&s;ts as well as travellers agree
in affirming, that the male organ of the elephant
exceeds not, either in length or diameter<NOTE N="&dagger;" TYPE="foot">Elephantus genitale equo &s;imile habet, &s;ed parvum nec pro corporis magnitudine. Te&s;tes idem non $oris con&s;picuos &s;ed intus circa renes conditos habet; <HI>Ari&s;t. hi&s;t. anim. lib. 2. cap. 1.&mdash;L'Afrique d'Ogilby, p. l3. et</HI> 14.</NOTE>, that
of a hor&s;e. It is, therefore, impo&s;&s;ible that he
&s;hould attain his end in the ordinary po&s;ition of

therefore, more time and conveniency for this
operation than other quadrupeds; and it is, per|haps,
for this rea&s;on, that they never copulate
but when they enjoy full liberty, and have every
nece&s;&s;ary article at their command. The female
mu&s;t not only con&s;ent, but &s;olicit the male by a

we not, therefore, conclude, that mode&s;ty is a
phy&s;ical virtue which exi&s;ts in the brute creation?
It is, at lea&s;t, like &s;oftne&s;s, moderation, and tem|perance,
a general and beautiful attribute of the
female &s;ex.</P>
<P>Thus the elephant neither &s;ucks, generates,
eats, nor drinks like other animals. The &s;ound
of his voice is likewi&s;e extremely &s;ingular. If
we believe the antients, the elephant utters two
kinds of cries, one by the trunk, which, from its
&s;inuo&s;ities and inflexions, is rough and long, like
the &s;ound of a trumpet; and another by the
mouth, which is interrupted by &s;hort pau&s;es and
har&s;h &s;ighs<NOTE N="&dagger;" TYPE="foot">Elephants citra nares ore ip &s;o vocem edit &s;pirabundam, quemadmodum cum homo &s;imul et &s;piritum reddit et loquitur, at per nares &s;imile tubarum raucitati &s;onat; <HI>Ari&s;t. hi&s;t. anim. lib.</HI> 4. cap. 9.&mdash;Citra nares ore ip&s;o &s;ternutamento &s;imilem edit &s;onum; per nares autem tubarum raucitati; <HI>Plin, hi&s;t. nat. lib</HI> 8.</NOTE>. This fact, which was advanced
<PB N="61" REF="64">
by Ari&s;totle, and afterwards repeated by natu|rali&s;ts
and travellers, is probably fal&s;e, or, at lea&s;t,
not exactly related. M. de Bu&s;&s;y denies that the
elephant utters any cry through the trunk. How|ever,
as a man, by &s;hutting his mouth clo&s;e, can
make a &s;ound through his no&s;e, the elephant,
who&s;e no&s;e is &s;o large, may produce &s;ounds in
the &s;ame manner. But, however this may be,
the cry of the elephant is heard at the di&s;tance
of more than a league, and yet it excites not
terror, like the roaring of the lion or tiger.</P>
<P>The elephant is &s;till more &s;ingular in the
&s;tructure of his feet, and the texture of his &s;kin,
which la&s;t is not, like other quadrupeds, covered
with hair, but totally bare, as if it were &s;haven.
There are only a few bri&s;tles in the fi&s;&s;ures of
the &s;kin, and the&s;e bri&s;tles are thinly &s;cattered
over the body, but very numerous on the cilia
and back of the head<NOTE N="&ast;" TYPE="foot">Memoires pour &s;ervir &agrave; l'Hi&s;toire des animaux, part. 3, p. 113.</NOTE>, in the auditory pa&s;&s;ages,
and the in&s;ides of the thighs and legs. In the
epidermis, or &s;carf &s;kin, there are two kinds of
wrinkles, the one rai&s;ed and the other depre&s;&s;ed,
which give it the appearance of being cut into
fi&s;&s;ures, re&s;embling pretty nearly the bark of an
old oak tree. In man and the other animals,
<PB N="62" REF="65">
the epidermis adheres throughout to the &s;kin;
but, in the elephant, it is only attached by &s;ome
points of in&s;ertion, like two pieces of cloth
&s;titched together. This epidermis is naturally
dry, and very &s;ubject to grow thick. It often
acquires the thickne&s;s of three or four lines, by
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive drying of different layers which are
produced one above another. It is this thicken|ing
of the &s;carf &s;kin which gives ri&s;e to the <HI>ele|phantia&s;is</HI>
or <HI>dry lepro&s;y,</HI> to which man, who&s;e
&s;kin is naked like that of the elephant, is &s;ome|times
&s;ubject. This di&s;ea&s;e is very common to
the elephant; and the Indians, to prevent it,
rub him frequently with oil, and bathe him with
water, with a view to pre&s;erve the &s;kin clean and
flexible. The &s;kin, where it is not callous, is
extremely &s;en&s;ible. In the fi&s;&s;ures, and other
places where it is neither dry nor hardened, the
elephant feels the &s;tinging of flies in &s;uch a live|ly
manner, that he not only employs his natu|ral
movements, but even the re&s;ources of his in|telligence,
to get rid of them. He &s;trikes them
with his tail, his ears, and his trunk. He con|tracts
his &s;kin, and cru&s;hes them between its
wrinkles. He drives them off with branches of
trees, or handfuls of long &s;traw. When all the&s;e
artifices are un&s;ucce&s;sful, he collects du&s;t with
his trunk, and covers all the &s;en&s;ible parts of his
&s;kin with it. He has been ob&s;erved pulverizing
him&s;elf in this manner &s;everal times in a day;
and always at the mo&s;t proper &s;ea&s;on, namely,
<PB N="63" REF="66">
after bathing<NOTE N="&ast;" TYPE="foot">I was informed that the elephant at Ver&s;ailles always rolled in the du&s;t after bathing, which he did as often as he was allowed; and it was ob&s;erved, that he threw du&s;t upon all the places which had been mi&s;&s;ed when he rolled him&s;elf, and that he drove off the flies with handfuls of &s;traw, or by throwing du&s;t with his trunk on the places where he felt him&s;elf &s;tung, there being nothing which the flies avoid &s;o much as falling du&s;t; <HI>Mem. pour &s;ervir &agrave; l'hi&s;t. des animaux, part.</HI> 3. p. 117.</NOTE>. The u&s;e of water is as nece&s;|&s;ary
to the&s;e animals as air. When free, they
never quit the banks of rivers, and often go into
the water till it reaches their belly, and in this
&s;ituation they daily &s;pend &s;everal hours. In In|dia,
where the elephants are treated in the man|ner
that be&s;t corre&s;ponds with their nature and
temperament, they are carefully bathed, and al|lowed
time and every po&s;&s;ible conveniency for
bathing them&s;elves<NOTE N="&dagger;" TYPE="foot">About eight or nine o'clock before noon, we went to the river to &s;ee the elephants belonging to the King and the Nobles bathed. The animal goes into the water till it reaches his belly, and, lying down on one &s;ide, fills his trunk &s;everal times, and throws the water upon the parts which are uncovered. The ma&s;ter then rubs off, with a kind of pumice &s;tone, all the dirt that has been collected on the creature's &s;kin. Some authors tell us, that, when the elephant lies down, he is unable to rai&s;e him&s;elf. But this a&s;&s;ertion is not founded in truth; for the ma&s;ter, after rubbing one &s;ide, de&s;ires the animal to turn to the other, which he does very quickly; and, after both &s;ides are well curried, he comes out of the river, and &s;tands &s;ome time on the bank till he dries. The ma&s;ter then brings a pot of red or yellow paint, and draws lines on the elephant's face, round the eyes, upon the brea&s;t and rump. He is next rubbed over with oil to &s;trengthen his nerves; <HI>Voyage de Tavernier, tom.</HI> 3. p. 264.</NOTE>. Their &s;kin is cleaned by
<PB N="64" REF="67">
rubbing it with a pumice &s;tone; and then they
are anointed with perfumed oils, and painted
with various colours.</P>
<P>The &s;tructure of the elephant's feet and legs
&s;till differs from that of mo&s;t other animals. The
fore legs appear to be longer than the hind legs,
and yet the former are &s;omewhat &s;horter<NOTE N="&ast;" TYPE="foot">Mem. pour &s;ervlr &agrave; l'hi&s;t. des anim. part. 3. p. 102.</NOTE>. The
hind legs are not bended in two places like tho&s;e
of the hor&s;e and ox, in whom the thigh-bone is
almo&s;t totally concealed in the buttock, the knee
is &s;ituated near the belly, and the bones of the
foot are &s;o high and &s;o long, that they appear to
con&s;titute a great part of the leg. But the foot
of the elephant is very &s;hort, and re&s;ts on the
ground. His knee, like that of man, is placed
near the middle of the leg. The &s;hort foot of
the elephant is divided into five toes, which are
&s;o covered with the &s;kin as not to be vi&s;ible.
We only &s;ee a kind of nails, the number of which
varies, though that of the toes remains always
the &s;ame. There are uniformly five toes on
each foot, and commonly five nails<NOTE N="&dagger;" TYPE="foot">The royal Academy of &s;ciences recommended to me to examine whether all the elephants had nails on their feet. I never &s;aw a &s;ingle elephant which had not five on each foot at the extremities of the five large toes. But the toes are &s;o &s;hort, that they hardly project from the foot; <HI>Premier voyage de P. Tachard, p.</HI> 273.</NOTE>; but &s;ome|times
there are only four<NOTE N="&Dagger;" TYPE="foot">All tho&s;e who have written concerning the elephant, a&s;&s;ign five nails to each foot; but, in our &s;ubject, there were only three. The &s;mall Indian elephant formerly mentioned had four nails both on the fore and hind feet. But there are uniformly five toes on each foot; <HI>Mem. pour &s;ervir &agrave; l'hi&s;t. des animaux, part.</HI> 3. p. 103.</NOTE>, or even three nails;
<PB N="65" REF="68">
and, in this ca&s;e, they corre&s;pond not exactly
with the extremities of the toes. Be&s;ides, this
variety, which has only been remarked in young
elephants brought to Europe, &s;eems to be pure|ly
accidental, and probably depends on the man|ner
the animal has been treated during the fir&s;t
years of its growth. The &s;ole of the foot is co|vered
with a kind of leather as hard as horn, and
projects outward all around. The nails con&s;i&s;t
of the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>The ears of the elephant are very long, move|able
at plea&s;ure, and &s;erve the animal as a fan.
The tail is not longer than the ears, being gene|rally
from two and a half to three feet in length.
It is thin, pointed, and garni&s;hed at the extremi|ty
with a tu$t of thick hairs, or rather threads
of a black, glo&s;&s;y, &s;olid, horny &s;ub&s;tance. This hair
or horn is as thick and &s;trong as iron-wire, and a
man cannot break it by pulling it with his hands,
though it be flexible and ela&s;tic. In fine, this
tuft of hair is greatly e&s;teemed as an ornament
by the Negro women, who are probably attach|ed
to it by &s;ome &s;uper&s;tition<NOTE N="&ast;" TYPE="foot">Merolla remarks, that many of the Pagans in the&s;e countries, and particularly the Saggas, have a devout regard for the elephant's tail. When any of their chiefs die, they pre&s;erve, in honour of him, one of the&s;e tails, to which they pay a kind of religious wor&s;hip, founded on the notion of its power. They often go a hunting solely with a view to obtain a tail of this kind. But it must be cut off with a single blow from the live animal, without which, superstition ascribes to it no virtue; Hist gen. des Voyages, par l'Abb&eacute; Prevost, tom. s. p. 79.</NOTE>. An elephant's
<PB N="66" REF="69">
tail is &s;ometimes &s;old for two or three &s;laves;
and the Negroes often hazard their lives in en|deavouring
to cut it off from the live animal.
Be&s;ide this tuft, the tail is covered, or rather
&s;trewed, through its whole extent, with bri&s;tles
as large and as hard as tho&s;e of the wild boar.
The&s;e bri&s;tles are al&s;o found on the convex part
of the trunk and the eye-brows, where they
&s;ometimes exceed a foot in length. Bri&s;tles or
hairs on the eye-lids are peculiar to man, the
monkey, and the elephant.</P>
<P>Climate, food, and &s;ituation, have a great in|fluence
on the growth and &s;ize of the elephant.
In general, &s;uch as are taken young, and reduced
to captivity, never acquire their natural dimen|&s;ions.
The large&s;t elephants of India and the
ea&s;tern parts of Africa are fourteen feet high;
the &s;malle&s;t, which are found in Senegal, and o|ther
we&s;tern regions of Africa, exceed not ten or
eleven feet; and tho&s;e which are brought young
to Europe never arrive at this height. The Ver|failles
elephant, which came from Congo<NOTE N="&ast;" TYPE="foot">Mem. pour &s;ervir &agrave; l'hi&s;t. des animaux, part. 3. p. 101.</NOTE>, at
the age of &s;even years, was not above &s;even and
a half feet high. During the thirteen years that
he lived, he acquired only one foot; &s;o that, at
the age of four, when he was tran&s;ported, he was
<PB N="67" REF="70">
only &s;ix and a half feet in height; and, as the
rate of growth always dimini&s;hes as animals ad|vance
in years, it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, that, if he
had lived thirty years, the common period when
the growth of elephants is completed, he would
have acquired more than eight feet in height.
Hence the dome&s;tic &s;tate reduces the growth of
the elephant one third, not only in height, but
in all other dimen&s;ions. The length of his body,
from the eye to the origin of the tail, is nearly
equal to his height at the withers. An Indian
elephant, therefore, of fourteen feet high, is more
than &s;even times larger and heavier than the
Ver&s;ailles elephant. By comparing the growth
of this animal to that of man, we will find, that
an infant, being commonly thirty-one inches
high, that is, one half of its height, at the age of
two years, and taking its full growth at twenty
years, the elephant, which grows till thirty, ought
to acquire the half of his height in three years.
In the &s;ame manner, if we would form a judg|ment
of the enormous ma&s;s of the elephant, we
will find, that, the volume of a man's body being
&s;uppo&s;ed to be two cubic feet and a half, the
body of an elephant of fourteen feet long, three
feet thick, and a proportional breadth, would be
fifty times as large; and, con&s;equently, that an
elephant ought to weigh as much as fifty men<NOTE N="&ast;" TYPE="foot">Peir&egrave;re, in his life of Ga&s;&s;endi, &s;ays, that an elephant which he cau&s;ed to be weighed, was three thou&s;and five hun|dred pounds. This elephant &s;eems to have been very &s;mall; for, according to the calculation I have made in the text, the dimen&s;ions of which I rather under-rated, would have weighed at lea&s;t eight thou&s;and pounds.</NOTE>.

The price of the&s;e animals augments in propor|tion

certain dimen&s;ions, the price ri&s;es like

<P>From the&s;e, and many other te&s;timonies which
might be enumerated, we may conclude, that the
ordinary &s;tature of the elephant is from ten to
eleven feet; that tho&s;e of thirteen and fourteen
are very rare; and that the &s;malle&s;t, when they
<PB N="69" REF="76">
acquire their full growth in a &s;tate of liberty, are
at lea&s;t nine feet. The&s;e enormous ma&s;&s;es of
matter fail not, however, as formerly remarked,
to move with great quickne&s;s. They are &s;up|ported
by four members, which, in&s;tead of
legs, re&s;emble ma&s;&s;y columns of fifteen or eigh|teen
inches diameter, and from five to &s;ix feet
high. The&s;e legs, therefore, are twice as long
as tho&s;e of man. Hence, though the elephant
&s;hould make but one &s;tep, while a man makes
two, it would out&s;trip him in the chace. The
ordinary walk of the elephant is not quicker
than that of a hor&s;e<NOTE N="&ast;" TYPE="foot">Notes of M. de Bu&s;&s;y, communicated by the Marquis de Montmirail.</NOTE>; but, when pu&s;hed, he a&s;|&s;umes
a kind of amble, which, in fleetne&s;s, is e|quivalent
to a gallop. He performs with prompt|ne&s;s,
and even with freedom, all direct move|ments;
but he wants facility in oblique or
retrograde motions. It is generally in narrow and
hollow places, where the elephant can hardly turn,
that the Negroes attack him, and cut off his tail,
which they value above all the re&s;t of the body.
He has great difficulty in de&s;cending &s;teep decli|vities,
and is obliged to fold his hind legs<NOTE N="&Dagger;" TYPE="foot">Notes of M. de Bu&s;&s;y.</NOTE>, that,
in going down, the anterior part of his body
may be on a level with the po&s;terior, and to
prevent being precipitated by his own weight.
He &s;wims well, though the form of his legs and
feet &s;eem to indicate the contrary. But, as the
<PB N="70" REF="77">
capacity of his brea&s;t and belly is large, as the
&s;ize of his lungs and inte&s;tines is enormous, and
as all the great parts of his body are filled with
air, or matters lighter than water, he &s;inks not &s;o
deep as other animals. He has, therefore, le&s;s
re&s;i&s;tence to overcome, and, con&s;equently, is ena|bled
to &s;wim more quickly with &s;maller efforts
of his limbs. Of cour&s;e, he is of great u&s;e in
the pa&s;&s;age of rivers. When employed on the&s;e
occa&s;ions<NOTE N="&ast;" TYPE="foot">Notes of M. de Bu&s;&s;y.</NOTE>, be&s;ide two pieces of cannon which
admit three or four pound balls, he is loaded
with great quantities of baggage, independent
of a number of men fixed to his ears and his
tail. When thus loaded, he enters the river, and
&s;wims &s;o much below the water that no part of
his body is &s;een except his trunk, which he
rai&s;es in the air for the benefit of re&s;piration.</P>
<P>Though the elephant generally feeds on herbs
and tender wood, and though prodigious quan|tities
of this aliment are nece&s;&s;ary to afford a
&s;ufficient number of organic particles to nouri&s;h
&s;o va&s;t a body, he has not &s;everal &s;tomachs, like
mo&s;t animals who live on the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tances.
He has but one &s;tomach, does not ruminate, and
is formed rather like the hor&s;e than the ox and
other ruminating animals. The want of a
paunch is &s;upplied by the largene&s;s and length
of his inte&s;tines, and particularly of the colon,
which is two or three feet in diameter by fifteen
or twenty in length. The &s;tomach is much
<PB N="71" REF="78">
&s;maller than the colon, being only three and a
half or four feet long, and only one or one and
a half in its large&s;t diameter. To fill &s;uch ca|pacious
ve&s;&s;els, it is nece&s;&s;ary that the animal,
when not furni&s;hed with nouri&s;hment more &s;ub|&s;tantial
than herbage, &s;hould eat almo&s;t perpe|tually.
Wild elephants, accordingly, are almo&s;t
continually employed tearing up trees, gather|ing
leaves, and breaking young wood; and the
dome&s;tic elephants, though &s;upplied with great
quantities of rice, fail not to collect herbs when|ever
they have an opportunity. However great
the appetite of the elephant, he eats with mode|ration,
and his ta&s;te for cleanline&s;s is &s;uperior to
the calls of hunger. His addre&s;s in &s;eparating
with his trunk the good leaves from the bad,
and the care which he takes in &s;haking them till
they are perfectly clear of in&s;ects and fand, af|ford

him to the highe&s;t marks of di&s;tinction; and
the reader will find how often I &s;hall have oc|ca&s;ion
to quote him in the &s;ub&s;equent parts of
this work. &startq;The elephant is u&s;ed in dragging
artillery over mountains; and it is on &s;uch
occa&s;ions that his &s;agacity is mo&s;t con&s;picuous.
When the oxen, yoked to a cannon, make an
effort to pull it up a declivity, the elephant
pu&s;hes the breach with his front, and, at each
effort, he &s;upports the carriage with his knee,
which he places again&s;t the wheel. He &s;eems
to under&s;tand what is &s;aid to him. When his
conductor wants him to execute any painful
labour, he explains the nature of the opera|tion,
and recites the rea&s;ons which ought to
induce him to obey. If the elephant &s;hows a
repugnance to what is exacted of him, the
<HI>Cornack,</HI> which is the name of the conductor,
promi&s;es to give him arrack, or &s;ome other
thing that he likes. But it is extremely dan|gerous
<PB N="73" REF="82">
to break any promi&s;e that is made to
him: Many cornacks have fallen victims to in|di&s;cretions
of this kind. On this &s;ubject, a fact,
which happened at Dekan, de&s;erves to be rela|ted,
and, though it has the appearance of in|credibility,
is, notwith&s;tanding, exactly true.
An elephant, out of revenge, killed his cornack.
The man's wife, who beheld the dreadful
&s;cene, took her two infants and threw them at
the feet of the enraged animal, &s;aying, <HI>Since
you have &s;lain my hu&s;band, take my life al&s;o, as
well as that of my children.</HI> The elephant in|&s;tantly
&s;topped, relented, and, as if &s;tung with
remor&s;e, took the elde&s;t boy in its trunk,
placed him on its neck, adopted him for its
cornack, and would never allow any other per|&s;on
to mount it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If the elephant is vindictive, he is not un|grateful.
A &s;oldier at Pondicherry was accu|&s;tomed
to give a certain quantity of arrack to
one of the&s;e animals every time he got his pay;
and, having one day intoxicated him&s;elf, and,
being pur&s;ued by the guard, who wanted to
put him in pri&s;on, he took refuge under the
elephant, and fell fa&s;t a&s;leep. The guard in
vain attempted to drag him from this a&s;&s;ylum;
for the elephant defended him with its trunk.
Next day, the &s;oldier having recovered from
his drunkenne&s;s, was in dreadful apprehen&s;ions
when he found him&s;elf under the belly of an
animal &s;o enormous. The elephant, which
<PB N="74" REF="83">
unque&s;tionably perceived his terror, care&s;&s;ed
him with its trunk.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The elephant is &s;ometimes &s;eized with a
kind of madne&s;s, which deprives him of all
tractability, and renders him &s;o formidable,
that it is often nece&s;&s;ary to kill him. The
people try to bind him with large iron
chains, in the hope of reclaiming him.
But, when in his ordinary &s;tate, the mo&s;t a|cute
pains will not provoke him to hurt tho&s;e
who have never injured him. An elephant,
rendered furious by the wounds it had received
at the battle of Hambour, ran about the field
making the mo&s;t hideous cries. A &s;oldier,
notwith&s;tanding the alarms of his comrades,
was unable, perhaps on account of his wounds,
to fly. The elephant approached, &s;eemed a|fraid
of trampling him under its feet, took him
up with its trunk, placed him gently on his
&s;ide, and continued its route.&endq;</P>
<P>The&s;e notes I have tran&s;cribed verbatim.
They were communicated to the Marquis de
Montmirail by M. de Bu&s;&s;y, who re&s;ided ten
years in India, and performed many important
&s;ervices to the &s;tate. He had &s;everal elephants
under his own charge, often rode upon them,
and had daily opportunities of ob&s;erving many
others, which belonged to his neighbours. Hence
the&s;e notes, as well as all the others quoted un|der
the name of M. de Bu&s;&s;y, merit every de|gree
of credit. The members of the Royal
<PB N="75" REF="84">
Academy of Sciences have al&s;o left us &s;ome facts,
which they learned from tho&s;e who had the
management of the elephant at Ver&s;ailles, and
which de&s;erve a place in this work. &startq;The ele|phant
&s;eemed to know when it was mocked
by any per&s;on; and remembered the affront
till an opportunity of revenge occurred. A
man deceived it, by pretending to throw &s;ome|thing
into its mouth: The animal gave him
&s;uch a blow with its trunk as knocked him
down, and broke two of his ribs. After which,
it trampled on him with its feet, broke one of
his leg, and, bending down on its knees, en|deavoured
to pu&s;h its tu&s;ks into his belly; but
they luckily run into the ground on each &s;ide
of his thigh, without doing him any injury.
A painter wanted to draw the animal in an
unu&s;ual attitude, with its trunk elevated, and
its mouth open. The painter's &s;ervant, to
make it remain in this po&s;ition, threw fruits
into its mouth, but generally made only a
faint of throwing them. The elephant was
enraged, and, as if it knew that the painter
was the cau&s;e of this teazing impertinence, in|&s;tead
of attacking the &s;ervant, it eyed the
ma&s;ter, and &s;quirted at him &s;uch a quantity of
water from its trunk as &s;poiled the paper on
which he was drawing.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This elephant generally made le&s;s u&s;e of its
&s;trength than its addre&s;s. With great ea&s;e
and coolne&s;s, it loo&s;ed the buckle of a large
<PB N="76" REF="85">
double leathern &s;trap, with which its leg was
fixed; and, as the dome&s;tics had wrapped the
buckle round with a &s;mall cord, and tied many
knots on it, the creature deliberately loo&s;ed
the whole, without breaking either the cord or
the &s;trap. One night, after di&s;engaging it&s;elf
in this manner from its &s;trap, it broke up the
door of its lodge with &s;uch dexterity as not to
waken the keeper. From thence it went into
&s;everal courts of the menagery, forcing open
doors, and throwing down the walls when the
doors were too narrow to let it pa&s;s. In this
manner it got acce&s;s to the apartments of o|ther
animals, and &s;o terrified them, that they
fled into the mo&s;t retired corners of the encl$|&s;ure.&endq;</P>
<P>In fine, that nothing may be omitted which
can contribute to throw light upon the natural
and acquired faculties of an animal &s;o &s;uperior
to all others, we &s;hall add &s;ome facts, extracted
from the mo&s;t re&s;pectable and un&s;u&s;picious tra|vellers.</P>
<P>&startq;Even the wild elephant,&endq; &s;ays le P. Vincent
Marie, &startq;has his virtues. He is generous and&punc;
temperate; and, when rendered dome&s;tic, he
is e&s;teemed for gentlene&s;s and fidelity to his
ma&s;ter, friend&s;hip to his governour, &amp;c. If
de&s;tined to the immediate &s;ervice of Princes,
he recogni&s;es his good fortune, and maintains
a gravity of demeanour corre&s;ponding to the
<PB N="77" REF="86">
dignity of his office. If, on the contrary, le&s;s
honourable labours are a&s;&s;igned to him, he
turns melancholy, frets, and evidently di&s;co|vers
that he is humbled and depre&s;&s;ed. In
war, during the fir&s;t on&s;et, he is fiery and
impetuous. When &s;urrounded with hunters,
he is equally brave. But, after being van|qui&s;hed,
he lo&s;es all courage. He fights with
his tu&s;ks, and dreads nothing &s;o much as to
lo&s;e his trunk, which, from its con&s;i&s;tence, is
ea&s;ily cut........ I &s;hall only add, that the
elephant is mild, attacks no per&s;on without
being injured, &s;eems to love &s;ociety, is parti|cularly
fond of children, whom he care&s;&s;es,
and appears to di&s;cern the innocence of their
manners.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The elephant,&endq; &s;ays Pyrard<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Fran&ccedil;ois Pyrard, tom. 2. p. 366.</NOTE>, &startq;is an animal
of &s;o much knowledge and judgment, that,
be&s;ide his infinite utility to man, he may be
&s;aid to enjoy a certain portion of rea&s;on. When
about to be ridden, he is &s;o obedient and well
trained, that he accommodates his behaviour
to the quality of the per&s;on he &s;erves. He
bends down, and a&s;&s;i&s;ts his ma&s;ter to mount
with his trunk....... He is &s;o tractable, that
he will perform any thing that is required of
him, provided he be treated with, gentlene&s;s...
He does every thing he is de&s;ired, care&s;&s;es

<P>&startq;The elephant,&endq; P. Philippe remarks<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Voyage d'Orient. du P, Philippe de la Tr&egrave;s-Sainte-Trinit&eacute;, p. 366.</NOTE>, &startq;makes
a near approach to the judgment and rea&s;oning
of man. When compared with the apes, they
appear to be &s;tupid and brutal animals. The
elephants are &s;o extremely mode&s;t, that they
will not copulate in the pre&s;ence of any per|&s;on;
and, if by accident, any man perceives
this operation, they infallibly re&s;ent it, &amp;c....
Their &s;alute is performed by bending the
knees, and lowering the head; and, when their
<PB N="79" REF="88">
ma&s;ter wants to mount them, they a&s;&s;i&s;t him
with great dexterity. When a wild elephant
is taken, the hunters tie his feet, and one ac|co&s;ts
and &s;alutes him, makes apologies for
binding him, prote&s;ts that no injury is meant,
tells him, that, in his former condition, he of|ten
wanted food, but that, henceforward, he
&s;hall be well treated, and that every promi&s;e
&s;hall be performed to him, &amp;c. The hunter
no &s;ooner fini&s;hes this &s;oothing harangue, than
the elephant follows him like a tamed lamb.
We mu&s;t not, however, conclude from hence,
that the elephant under&s;tands language, but
only, that, having a very &s;trong di&s;cerning
faculty, he di&s;tingui&s;hes e&s;teem from contempt,
friend&s;hip from hatred, and all the other emo|tions
which men exhibit to him; and for this
rea&s;on he is more ea&s;ily tamed by arguments
than by blows......... With his trunk he
throws &s;tones very far, and very &s;traight, and
al&s;o u&s;es it for pouring water on his body when
bathing.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Of five elephants,&endq; Tavernier remarks<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Tavernier, tom. 3. p. 238.</NOTE>,
&startq;which the hunters had taken, three e&s;caped,
though ropes and chains were thrown round
their bodies and limbs. The natives told us
the following mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing &s;tory, if it could
be credited. When an elephant, they &s;aid,
has once been caught in a pitfall, and e&s;capes
from the &s;nare, he becomes extremely diffi|dent,
<PB N="80" REF="89">
breaks off a large branch with his trunk,
and &s;trikes the ground every where before he
&s;ets down his feet, in order to di&s;cover by the
&s;ound whether there are any concealed holes
by which he may be entrapped a &s;econd time.
For this rea&s;on, the hunters who related this
&s;tory de&s;paired of being able, without much
difficulty, to retake the three elephants which
had made their e&s;cape....... Each of the
two elephants which had been &s;eized were
placed between two tames ones, and &s;urround|ed
by &s;ix men with burning torches, who
&s;poke to the animals, and, pre&s;enting food to
them, &s;aid, in their language, <HI>take this and eat
it.</HI> The food con&s;i&s;ted of &s;mall bunches of
hay, pieces of black &s;ugar, and boiled rice
mixed with pepper. When the wild elephant
refu&s;ed to do what he was ordered, the men
ordered the tame elephants to beat him, which
they performed, the one &s;triking him on the
front and head, and, if the captive animal at|tempted
to defend him&s;elf, the other &s;truck
him on the &s;ide; &s;o that the poor creature knew
not where he was, and &s;oon found him&s;elf o|bliged
to obey.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have frequently remarked,&endq; &s;ays Edward
Terry<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Voyage to the Ea&s;t Indies by Edward Terry, p. 15.</NOTE>, &startq;that the elephant performs many ac|tions
which &s;eem to proceed more from rea|&s;on
than from in&s;tinct. He does every thing
that his ma&s;ter commands: If he wants to ter|rify
<PB N="81" REF="90">
any per&s;on, he runs upon him with every
appearance of fury, and, when he comes near,
&s;tops &s;hort, without doing him the &s;malle&s;t
injury. When the ma&s;ter choo&s;es to affront
any man, he tells the elephant, who collects
water and mud with his trunk, and &s;quirts it
upon the object pointed out to him. The
trunk is compo&s;ed of cartilage, hangs between
the tu&s;ks, and is by &s;ome called his <HI>hand,</HI> be|cau&s;e,
on many occa&s;ions, it an&s;wers the &s;ame
purpo&s;es as the human hand.... The Mogul
keeps &s;ome elephants who &s;erve as execution|ers
to criminals condemned to death. When
the conductor orders one of the&s;e animals to
de&s;patch the poor criminals quickly, he tears
them to pieces in a moment with his feet.
But, if de&s;ired to torment them &s;lowly, he
breaks their bones one after another, and
makes them &s;uffer a puni&s;hment as cruel as
that of the wheel.&endq;</P>
<P>We might quote many other facts equally
curious and intere&s;ting. But we would &s;oon
exceed the limits we have pre&s;cribed to our&s;elves
in this work. We would not even have given
&s;o lo long a detail, if the elephant had not been,
in many re&s;pects, the chief animal in the brute
creation, and who, of cour&s;e, merited the great|e&s;t
attention.</P>
<P>M. Daubenton has made &s;everal u&s;eful re|marks
on the nature and qualities of ivory, and
has re&s;tored to the elephant tho&s;e prodigious
<PB N="82" REF="91">
tu&s;ks and bones which have been attributed to
the Mammouth. I acknowledge, that I was long
doubtful with regard to this point. I had often
compared the&s;e enormous bones with the &s;kele|ton
of nearly a full grown elephant pre&s;erved
in the Royal Cabinet: And as, before compo&s;ing
their hi&s;tory, I could not per&s;uade my&s;elf that
there exi&s;ted elephants &s;ix or &s;even times larger
than the one who&s;e &s;keleton I had &s;o often ex|amined,
and, as the large bones had not the
&s;ame proportions with the corre&s;ponding bones
of the elephant, I believed, with the generality
of naturali&s;ts, that the&s;e huge bones belonged to
a much larger animal, the &s;pecies of which had
been lo&s;t or annihilated. But it is certain, from
the facts formerly mentioned, that there are ele|phants
fourteen feet high, and, con&s;equently,
(as the ma&s;&s;es are as the cubes of the height), &s;ix
or &s;even times larger than that who&s;e &s;keleton
is in the Royal Cabinet, and which was not a|bove
&s;even, or &s;even and a half feet high. It is
likewi&s;e certain, that age changes the propor|tions
of bones, and that adult animals grow con|&s;iderably
thicker, though their &s;tature does not
increa&s;e. In fine, it is certain, from the te&s;timo|nies
of travellers, that there are elephants tu&s;ks,
each of which weighs more than a hundred and
twenty pounds<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Mr Eden informs us, that he mea&s;ured &s;everal elephants tu&s;ks, which he found to be nine feet long; that others were as thick as a man's thigh; and that &s;ome of them weighed ninety pounds.

From all the&s;e facts, it is ap|parent,

parent, that the prodigious bones and tu&s;ks a|bove

the &s;ame thing; but brings no proof of the fact.
M. Gmelin affirms it &s;till more po&s;itively<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>In Siberia, there are prodigious quantities of bones found in different places under the ground. This part of natural hi&s;tory is both curious and important: I have therefore col|lected all the facts I could learn upon this &s;ubject. Peter the Great, who was a patron of naturali&s;ts, gave orders to his &s;ubjects, in the year 1722, that, wherever any bones of the mammouth were di&s;covered, the other bones belonging to the animal &s;hould be diligently &s;ought for, and the whole &s;ent to Peter&s;burg. The&s;e orders were publi&s;hed in all the towns of Siberia, and, among others, in Jakutzk, where, after this pu|blication, a Slu&s;chewoi, called <HI>Wa&s;ilei Otla&s;ow,</HI> entered into a writ|ten obligation before Michaele Petrowit&s;ch I&s;mailow, captain|lieutenant of the guard, and Woywode of the place, to travel into the inferior cantons of Lena, in order to &s;earch for the bones of the mammouth; and he was de&s;patched thither on the 23d of April the &s;ame year. The following year, another ad|dre&s;&s;ed the Chancery of Jakutzk, and repre&s;ented, that he had travelled along with his &s;on toward the &s;ea, in que&s;t of the bones of the mammouth, and that, oppo&s;ite to Surjatoi No&s;s, about two hundred ver&s;ts from that place and the &s;ea, he found, in a turfy &s;oil, which is common in the&s;e di&s;tricts, the head of a mammouth with one of the horns adhering to it; and in the neighbourhood there was another horn of the &s;ame animal, which had probably fallen off while the creature was alive; that, at a little di&s;tance, they drew out of the earth another head, with the horns, of an unknown animal; that this head re&s;embled that of an ox, only it had horns above its no&s;e; that, on account of an accident which befel his eyes, he was obliged to leave the&s;e heads where they were; and that, having heard of his Maje&s;ty's orders, he now begged to be &s;ent off with his &s;on toward V&s;t-jan&s;koje, Simowie, and the &s;ea. His demand was complied with, and they were in&s;tantly de&s;patched. A third Slu&s;chewoi of Jakutzk repre&s;ented to the chancery, in 1724, that he made a voyage on the river Jelon; that he was happy enough to di&s;cover, in a &s;leep bank of this river, a fre&s;h head of the mammouth, with the horn and all its parts; that he drew it out of the earth, and left it where he could find it again; and that he begged to be &s;ent off with two men ac|cu&s;tomed to &s;uch re&s;earches. The woywode accordingly con|&s;ented. The Co&s;&s;ack &s;oon after &s;et out on his journey, and found the head and all its parts, excepting the horns; for there remained only the half of one horn, which he brought, along with the head, to the chancery of Jakutzk. Some time after, he brought two horns of the mammouth, which he al&s;o found on the river Jelon.</P>
<P>The Co&s;&s;acks of Jakutzk were extremely happy to find, un|der the pretext of going in que&s;t of the bones of the mammouth, an opportunity of making &s;uch agreeable voyages. They were furni&s;hed with five or &s;ix po&s;t hor&s;es, while one would have been &s;ufficient, and they could employ the re&s;t in carrying various articles of merchandize. Such an advantage was a great en|couragement to adventurers...... A Co&s;&s;ack of Jakutzk, called <HI>Jwan&s;ei&s;ku,</HI> petitioned the chancery to be &s;ent to the Simowies of Ala&s;ei&s;ch and Kowymi&s;ch, in que&s;t of the&s;e kind of bones, and of true cry&s;tal. He had already &s;ojourned in the&s;e places, had collected many curious objects, and actually &s;ent to Jakutzk &s;ome of the&s;e bones. Nothing &s;eemed more important than this expedition; and the Co&s;&s;ack was de&s;patch|ed on the 21&s;t day of April 1725.</P>
<P>Na&s;ar-Kole&s;chow, commi&s;&s;ary of Indigir&s;k, in the year 1723, &s;ent to Jakutzk, and from that to Irkurtzk, the bones of a &s;in|gular head, which, according to my information, was two ar&s;chines, bating three wer&s;chok, in length, one ar&s;chine high, and armed with two horns and a tu&s;k of the mammouth. This head arived at Irkutzk on the 14th day of October 1723; and I found the hi&s;tory of it in the chancery of that town. I was al&s;o a&s;&s;ured, that the &s;ame man afterwards &s;ent a horn of the mammouth.</P>
<P>The&s;e facts, collected from different &s;ources, regard, in ge|neral, the &s;ame &s;pecies of bones, namely, 1. All the bones in the Imperial cabinet of Peter&s;burg, under the name of <HI>Mammouth bones, will be &s;ound, upon examination, to have a perfect re|&s;emblance to tho&s;e of the elephant.</HI> 2. From what has been above related, it appears, that there have been found in the earth, heads of an animal totally different from an elephant, and which, particularly in the figure of the horns, re&s;embled the head of an ox more than that of an elephant. Be&s;ides, this animal could not be &s;o large as an elephant; and I have &s;een a head of it at Jakutzk, which had been &s;ent from Anadir|&s;koi-O&s;trog, and was, according to my information, perfectly &s;imilar to that found by Portn-jagin. I my&s;elf had one from Ilain&s;koi-O&s;trog, which I &s;ent to the Imperial cabinet at Pe|ter&s;burg. In fine, I learned, that, on the banks of Ni&s;chnaja-Tungu&s;ka, &s;imilar heads are not only found every where di&s;per|&s;ed, but likewi&s;e other bones which unque&s;tionably belong not to the elephant, &s;uch as &s;houlder bones, o&s;&s;a &s;acra, o&s;&s;a innominata, hip-bones, and leg-bones, which probably pertained to the &s;ame animal to which the above head ought to be attributed, and which &s;hould by no means be excluded from the ox kind. I have &s;een leg and hip-bones of this &s;pecies, concerning which I have nothing particular to remark, except that they ap|peared to be extremely &s;hort in proportion to their thickne&s;s. Thus, in Siberia, two kinds of bones are found in the earth, of which none were formerly e&s;teemed, but tho&s;e which perfectly re&s;embled the tu&s;ks of the elephant. But, after the Im|perial order, the whole began to be examined; and, as the first gave ri&s;e to the fable of the mammouth, the la&s;t have al&s;o been indi&s;criminately ranked under the &s;ame cla&s;s. Nei|ther mu&s;t we believe, with I&s;brand-Ides, and the followers of his reveries, that it is only in the mountains which extend from the river Ket to the North-ea&s;t, and, con&s;equently, likewi&s;e in the environs of Manga&s;ca and Jakutzk, where the elephants bones are to be found: For they appear not only through all Siberia, not excepting its mo&s;t &s;outhern di&s;tricts, as in the &s;upe|rior cantons of the Irti&s;ch, Toms, and Lena, but are di&s;per&s;ed in different parts of Ru&s;&s;ia, and even in many places of Ger|many, where they are called, with much propriety, by the name of <HI>fo&s;&s;il Ivory;</HI> for they have a perfect re&s;emblance to e|lephants teeth, except that they are in a corrupted &s;tate. In temperate climates, the&s;e teeth are &s;oftened and converted into fo&s;&s;il ivory; but, in countries frequently frozen, they are generally $$cund very fre&s;h. From this circum&s;tance, the fable, that tho&s;e and other bones are often found be&s;meared with blood&punc; might ea&s;ily ari&s;e. This fable has been gravely related by I&s;brand-Ides, and, after him, by Muller, (Moeurs et u&s;ages des O&s;tiaques, dans <HI>le Recueil des Voyages a$ Nord, p.</HI> 382.) who have been copied by others with equal confidence as if there had been no room for doubt: And, as one fiction begets an|other, the blood pretended to be found on tho&s;e bones has produced the notion, that the mammouth is an animal which lives in Siberia under the ground, where it &s;ometimes dies, and is buried under the rubbi&s;h. All this has been in|vented with the view to account for the blood pretended to be found on the&s;e bones. Muller gives a de&s;cription of the mam|mouth. This animal, &s;ays he, is four or five yards high, and about thirty feet long. His colour is grayi&s;h; his head is very long, and his front very broad. On each &s;ide, preci&s;ely under the eyes, there are two horns, which he can move and cro&s;s at plea&s;ure. In walking, he has the power of extending and contracting his body to a great degree. His paws, in thick|ne&s;s, re&s;emble tho&s;e of the bear. I&s;brandes-Ides is candid enough to acknowledge, that he never knew any per&s;on who had &s;een the mammouth alive........ The heads and other bones, which corre&s;pond with tho&s;e of the elephant, un|que&s;tionably once con&s;tituted real parts of that animal. To this abundance of elephants bones we cannot refu&s;e our a&s;|&s;ent; and I per&s;ume, that the elephants, to avoid de&s;truction in the great revolutions which have happened in the earth, have been driven from their native country, and di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves wherever they could find &s;afety. Their lot has been different. Some longer, and others &s;horter after their death, have been tran&s;ported to great di&s;tances by &s;ome va&s;t in|undation. Tho&s;e, on the contrary, who &s;urvived, and wan|dered far to the North, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have fallen victims to the rigours of the climate. Others, without reaching &s;o great a di&s;tance, might be drowned, or peri&s;h with fatigue..... The largene&s;s of tho&s;e bones ought not to a&s;toni&s;h us. The tu&s;ks are &s;ometimes four ar&s;chines long, and &s;ix inches in diame|ter, (M. de Strahlenberg &s;ays they have been &s;een nine inches in diameter,) and the large&s;t weigh from &s;ix to &s;even puds, I mentioned, in another place, that fre&s;h tu&s;ks have been taken from the elephant, which were ten feet long, and weighed a hundred, a hundred and forty-&s;ix, a hundred and &s;ixty, and a hundred and &s;ixty-eight pounds...... There are pieces of fo&s;&s;il ivory which are yellowi&s;h, or grow yellow in the cour&s;e of time; others are brown like coccoa nuts, and more lu&s;trous: and others of a blacki&s;h blue colour. The tu&s;ks which have not been much affected with the fro&s;t in the earth, and have remained &s;ome time expo&s;ed to the air, are &s;ubject to become more or le&s;s yellow or brown, and a&s;&s;ume other colours, according to the &s;pecies of humidity with which the air is impregnated. M. de Strahlenberg al&s;o remarks, that pieces of the&s;e corrupted teeth are &s;ometimes of a blui&s;h black colour...... For the intere&s;t of natural hi&s;tory, it were to be wished, that, with regard to the other bones found in Siberia, we knew the animal to which they belong; but there is little hope of accompli&s;hing this purpo&s;e; <HI>Relation d'un voyage a Kamt&s;chatka, bar M.

<P>From comparing the male and female ele|phants,
the former of which we &s;aw in the year
1771, and the latter in 1773, it appears, that, in
general, the parts of the female are gro&s;&s;er and
more fle&s;hy. Her ears, indeed, are proportion|ally
&s;maller than tho&s;e of the male: But her
body is more &s;wollen, her head larger, and her
members more rounded.</P>
<P>Like all other animals, the female elephant is
more gentle than the male. Our female-even
care&s;&s;ed people with whom &s;he was unacquaint|ed.
But the male is often formidable: The one
we &s;aw in 1771 was fiercer, le&s;s affectionate, and
<PB N="89" REF="102">
more ungovernable than this female. In a &s;tate
of repo&s;e, the genitals of the male appear not ex|ternally:
His belly &s;eems to be perfectly &s;mooth;
and it is only at the time of di&s;charging urine,
that the extremity of the penis comes out of the
&s;heath. This male elephant, though equally
young with the female, was, as formerly remar|ked,
more difficult to manage. He endeavoured
to lay hold of people who approached too near,
and often tore their clothes. Even his governours
were obliged to act with caution; but the female
obeyed with complacence and alacrity. The on|ly
time &s;he exhibited marks of di&s;plea&s;ure was
when her keepers forced her into a covered wag|gon,
in order to be carried from one town to an|other.
When they wanted her to enter, &s;he
refu&s;ed to advance, and they could only accom|pli&s;h
their purpo&s;e by pricking her behind. Ir|ritated
by this ill treatment, and being unable to
turn her&s;elf in her pri&s;on, &s;he had no other me|thod
of revenge but to fill her trunk with water,
and throw it in torrents upon tho&s;e who had
teazed her.</P>
<P>I remarked, in the hi&s;tory of the elephant<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See above, p. 59.</NOTE>,
that the&s;e animals probably did not copulate in
the manner of other quadrupeds; becau&s;e the
po&s;ition of the organs in both &s;exes &s;eemed to
require that the female, in order to receive the
male, &s;hould lie on her back. This conjecture
which appeared to be plau&s;ible, is not true; for
<PB N="90" REF="103">
the following te&s;timony of M. Marcel Bles, an
eye-witne&s;s, de&s;erves full credit.</P>
<P>&startq;Having perceived that the Count de Buffon,
in his excellent work, is deceived with regard
to the copulation of the elephants, I know, that,
in &s;everal parts of A&s;ia and Africa, the&s;e ani|mals,
e&s;pecially during the &s;ea&s;on of love, re|main
always in the mo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible places of
the fore&s;ts; but, in the i&s;land of Ceylon, where
I lived twelve years, the land being every where
inhabited, they cannot &s;o ea&s;ily conceal them|&s;elves;
and, having often examined them, I
perceived that the female organ is &s;ituated near|ly
under the middle of the belly, which would
lead us to think, with M. de Buffon, that the
males cannot cover the females in the manner
of other quadrupeds. However, there is only
a &s;light difference of &s;ituation. When they in|clined
to copulate, I perceived that the female
bowed down her head and neck, and leaned
her two fore legs, which were al&s;o bended, up|on
the root of a tree, as if &s;he meant to pro|&s;trate
her&s;elf on the ground; and the two hind
legs remained erect, which gave the male an
opportunity of embracing her as other quadru|peds
do. I can likewi&s;e affirm, that the fe|males
go with young about nine months.
Moreover, the elephants never copulate, unle&s;s
when in a &s;tate of freedom. In the &s;ea&s;on of
love, the males are &s;trongly chained for four
or five weeks, during which time, they di&s;|charge
<PB N="91" REF="104">
va&s;t quantities of &s;emen, and are &s;o fu|rious,
that their cornacks or governours can|not
come near them without danger. The ap|proach
of the rutting &s;ea&s;on is ea&s;ily known;
for, &s;ome days before it happens, an oily liquor
flows from a &s;mall hole on each &s;ide of the
head. The dome&s;tic female, on the&s;e occa|&s;ions,
&s;ometimes makes her e&s;cape, and joins
the wild males in the woods. Some days af|terward,
her cornack goes in que&s;t of her, and
calls her by her name till &s;he comes. She &s;ub|mits
to him with complacence, and allows her|&s;elf
to be conducted home, and &s;hut up in the
&s;table. It was from ca&s;es of this kind that it
was di&s;covered that the females bring forth a|bout
the end of nine months.&endq;</P>
<P>The fir&s;t remark, with regard to the mode of
copulating, &s;eems to be unque&s;tionable, &s;ince M.
Marcel Bles a&s;&s;ures us, that he has &s;een the ele|phants
perform the operation. But, as to the
time of ge&s;tation, which he limits to nine months,
we ought to &s;u&s;pend our judgment, becau&s;e all
travellers affirm, that the female elephant is
believed to go with young no le&s;s than two years.</P>

<HEAD>THE RHINOCEROS<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>The rhinoceros has one large horn, &s;ometimes two, pla|ced near the end of the no&s;e; it is &s;ometimes three feet and a half long, black, and &s;mooth.

The &s;kin is &s;o thick and &s;o &s;trong as to turn the edge of a &s;cymeter, and re&s;i&s;t a mu&s;ket ball. The tail is &s;lender, flatted at the end, and covered on the &s;ides with very &s;tiff, thick, black hairs. The belly hangs low. The legs are &s;hort, &s;trong, and thick.

The figure corre&s;ponds very well with mine. The a|nimal died in the pa&s;&s;age from the Ea&s;t Indies to Britain. This officer had written the following note at the bottom of the figure. &startq;His back was about &s;even feet high. His colour re&s;embled that of a hog who&s;e &s;kin is beginning to dry af|ter wallowing in the mire. He had three hoofs on each foot. The folds of his &s;kin lay backward on each other.

As this figure was commu|nicated to me by Dr Ty&s;on, I had not an opportunity of con|&s;ulting the author, whether the&s;e noxious in&s;ects, which he &s;ays take up their abode in the folds of the animal's &s;kin, were &s;een by him&s;elf, or whether he only related what had been told him by the Indians.

Mr&punc; Par&s;ons &s;aw one of two years, which was not higher than a heifer, which may be computed at about four feet. How, then, could the rhinoceros above taken notice of be only three years old, if it was &s;even feet high?</NOTE>.
<PB N="94" REF="108">
In magnitude, therefore, he makes a near ap|proach
to the elephant; and he appears to be
much le&s;s, only becau&s;e his legs are proportion|ally
&s;horter than tho&s;e of the elephant. But he
differs &s;till more from the elephant in his natu|ral
powers and intelligence; for Nature has be|&s;towed
on him nothing that elevates him above
the ordinary rank of quadrupeds. He is depri|ved
of all &s;en&s;ibility in his &s;kin; neither has he
hands to enable him to improve by the &s;en&s;e of
touching; and, in&s;tead of a trunk, he has only a
moveable lip, to which all his means of dexterity
or addre&s;s is limited. His chief &s;ources of &s;upe|riority
over other animals con&s;i&s;ts in his &s;trength,
his magnitude, and the offen&s;ive weapon on his
no&s;e, which is entirely peculiar to him. This
weapon is a very hard horn, &s;olid throughout its
whole extent, and &s;ituated more advantageou&s;ly
than the horns of ruminating animals, which de|fend
only the &s;uperior parts of the head and neck.
But the horn of the rhinoceros pre&s;erves from
in&s;ult the muzzle, the mouth, and the face. For
this rea&s;on, the tiger will rather attack the ele|phant,
who&s;e trunk he lays hold of, than the rhi|noceros,
whom he dare not face, without run|ning
the ri&s;k of having his bowels torn out; for
<PB N="95" REF="109">
the body and limbs of the rhinoceros are covered
with a &s;kin &s;o impenetrable, that he fears neither
the claws of the tiger or lion, nor the &s;word or
&s;hot of the hunter. His &s;kin is blacki&s;h,
being of the &s;ame colour, but thicker and harder than
that of the elephant, and is not &s;en&s;ible of the
&s;tinging of flies. He can neither extend nor
contract his &s;kin, which is rolled up into large
folds at the neck, the &s;houlders, and the crupper,
in order to facilitate the motion of his head and
limbs, which la&s;t are ma&s;&s;y, and terminated by
large feet, armed with three great toes. His
head is proportionally longer than that of the
elephant; but his eyes are &s;till &s;maller, and &s;el|dom
above half open. The upper lip, which
projects over the under one, is moveable, and can
be &s;tretched out about &s;ix or &s;even inches in
length; and it is terminated by a pointed appen|dix,
which gives this animal a power of collect|ing
herbage in handfuls as the elephant does with
its trunk. This mu&s;cular and flexible lip is a
kind of hand or imperfect trunk; but it enables
the creature to &s;eize any object with force, and
to feel with &s;ome dexterity. In&s;tead of tho&s;e
long ivory tu&s;ks which con&s;titute the armour of
the elephant, the rhinoceros has a formidable
horn, and two &s;trong inci&s;ive teeth in each jaw.
The&s;e teeth, of which the elephant is deprived,
are &s;ituated at a great di&s;tance from each other,
one in each angle of the jaw. The under jaw is
&s;quare before; and there are no other inci&s;ive
<PB N="96" REF="110">
teeth in the anterior part of the mouth, which is
covered by the lips. But, be&s;ide the four cut|ting
teeth in the four corners of the mouth, there
are twenty-four grinders, &s;ix on each &s;ide of the
two jaws. He holds his ears always erect: In
figure they re&s;emble tho&s;e of the hog; but they
are proportionally &s;maller. The ears are the
only parts of the body on which there are hairs,
or rather bri&s;tles. The extremity of the tail,
like that of the elephant, is garni&s;hed with a bu&s;h
of large, &s;olid, hard bri&s;tles.</P>

rhinoceros, from which I &s;hall the more willing|ly
make extracts, becau&s;e every compo&s;ition of
that gentleman merits the attention and confi|dence
of the public.</P>
<P>Though the rhinoceros was frequently exhi|bited
in the Roman &s;pectacles, from the days of
Pompey to tho&s;e of Heliogabulus; though he
has often been tran&s;ported into Europe in more
modern times; and though Bontius, Chardin,
and Kolben have drawn figures of him both in
India and Africa; yet &s;o ill was he repre&s;ented
and de&s;cribed, that he was very imperfectly
known till the errors and caprices of tho&s;e who
<PB N="97" REF="111">
had publi&s;hed figures of him were detected by
in&s;pection of the animals which arrived in Lon|don
in the years 1739 and 1741. The figure
given by Albert Durer was the fir&s;t, and the lea&s;t
conformable to Nature; yet it was copied by mo&s;t
naturali&s;ts, &s;ome of whom loaded it with pre|po&s;terous
drapery and foreign ornaments. That
of Bontius is more &s;imple and correct; but the
inferior part of the legs is improperly repre&s;ent|ed.
That of Chardin, on the contrary, gives
a pretty good idea of the feet, and the folds of
the &s;kin; but, in other re&s;pects, it has no re|&s;emblance
to the animal. That of Camerarius
is no better; neither is that drawn from the rhi|noceros
exhibited at London in the year 1685,
and which was publi&s;hed by Carwitham in the
1739. In fine, the figures on the antient pave|ment

are extremely imperfect; but they have the me|rit
of not being deformed by the imaginary or|naments
repre&s;ented in the figure drawn by Al|bert
Durer. Dr Par&s;ons has taken the trouble of
drawing this animal him&s;elf<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">One of our learned philo&s;ophers, M. de Mours, has made &s;ome remarks on this &s;ubject, which mu&s;t not be omitted. &startq;The figure,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;of the rhinoceros which Dr Par&s;ons has ad|ded to his Memoir, and which he drew from the life, is &s;o dif|ferent from that engraved at Paris in the year 1749, from a rhinoceros exhibited at the fair of Saint Germain, that it is difficult to recogni&s;e them to be the &s;ame animal. That of Dr Par&s;ons is &s;horter, and the folds of the &s;kin are fewer in number, less marked, and &s;ome of them placed in a different po&s;ition. The head, particularly, has hardly any re&s;emblance to that of the Saint-German rhinoceros. We cannot, howe|ver, entertain a doubt with regard to the accuracy of Dr Par&s;ons. The rea&s;ons of &s;uch remarkable differences mu&s;t be &s;ought for in the age and &s;ex of the two animals. That of Dr Par&s;ons was drawn from a male rhinoceros, which exceeded not the age of two years. That which I have here added, was drawn from a picture of the celebrated M. Oudry, a mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h|ed animal painter. He painted from the life, and of the na|tural &s;ize, the Saint-Germain rhinoceros, which was a female, and at lea&s;t eight years old; I &s;ay, at lead eight years; for we &s;ee, by an in&s;cription written on the bottom of a wooden print, entitled, <HI>A true portrait of a living rhinoceros exhibited at the fair of Saint-Germain in Paris,</HI> that this animal, when taken, in the 1741, in the province of A&s;&s;em, belonging to the Mo|gul, was three years old: And, eight lines lower, it is &s;aid, that the animal was only one month old when &s;ome Indians entangled it with ropes, after having &s;tain the mother by their &s;pears and darts. Hence it mu&s;t have been at lea&s;t eight years of age, and might be ten or twelve. This difference of age is probably the rea&s;on of the remarkable differences be|tween Dr Par&s;ons's figure and that of M. Oudry, who&s;e pic|ture, executed by the order of the King, was exhibited in the painter's hall. I &s;hall only remark, that M. Oudry has made the horn of his rhinoceros too long; for I examined the ani|mal with great attention, and I find that this part is better repre&s;ented in the wooden print. The horn of the pre&s;ent fi|gure was drawn after this print, and the re&s;t is copied from M. Oudry's picture. The animal which it repre&s;ents was weighed, about a year before, at Stouquart, in the dutchy of Wittemberg, and its weight was at that time five hundred pounds. It eat, according to the relation of Captain Dowe|mot Wan-dermeer, who conducted it to Europe, &s;ixty pounds of hay, and twenty pounds of bread, every day. It was very tame, and &s;urpri&s;ingly agile, con&s;idering the enormity of its ma&s;s, and its unwieldy a&s;pect.&endq; The&s;e remarks, like all tho&s;e of M. de Mours, are judicious and &s;en&s;ible. See the figure in his French tran&s;lation of the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, ann. 1743.</NOTE> in three different

the &s;ingle and double horns, as well as the tail,
from other rhinocero&s;es, who&s;e parts are pre&s;er|ved
in the cabinets of natural hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The rhinoceros which came to London in the
year 1739, was &s;ent from Bengal. Though not
above two years of age, the expence of his food
and journey amounted to near one thou&s;and
pounds Sterling. He was fed with rice, &s;ugar,
and hay. He had daily &s;even pounds of rice,
mixed with three pounds of &s;ugar, and divided
into three portions. He had likewi&s;e hay and
green herbs, which la&s;t he preferred to hay.
His drink was water, of which he took large
quantities at a time. He was of a peaceable di&s;|po&s;ition,
and allowed all parts of his body to be
touched. When hungry, or &s;truck by any per|&s;on,
he became mi&s;chievous, and, in both ca&s;es,
nothing appea&s;ed him but food. When enra|ged,
he &s;prung forward, and nimbly rai&s;ed him|&s;elf
to a great height, pu&s;hing, at the &s;ame time,
his head furiou&s;ly again&s;t the walls, which he
performed with amazing quickne&s;s, notwith|&s;tanding
his heavy a&s;pect and unwieldy ma&s;s.
I often ob&s;erved, &s;ays Dr Par&s;ons, the&s;e move|ments
produced by rage or impatience, e&s;pecial|ly
in the mornings before his rice and &s;ugar
were brought to him. The vivacity and promp|titude
of his movements, Dr Par&s;ons adds, led
<PB N="100" REF="114">
me to think, that he is altogether unconquerable,
and that he could ea&s;ily overtake any man who
&s;hould offend him.</P>
<P>This rhinoceros, at the age of two years, was
not taller than a young cow that has never pro|duced.
But his body was very long and very
thick. His head was di&s;proportionally large.
From the ears to the horn there is a concavity,
the two extremities of which, namely the upper
end of the muzzle, and the part near the ears,
are con&s;iderably rai&s;ed. The horn, which was
not yet above an inch high, was black, &s;mooth
at the top, but full of wrinkles directed back|ward
at the ba&s;e. The no&s;trils are &s;ituated ve|ry
low, being not above an inch di&s;tant from
the opening of the mouth. The under lip is
pretty &s;imilar to that of the ox; but the upper
lip has a greater re&s;emblance to that of the hor&s;e,
with this advantageous difference, that the rhi|noceros
can lengthen this lip, move it from &s;ide to &s;ide,
roll it about a &s;taff, and &s;eize with it a|ny
object he wi&s;hes to carry to his mouth. The
tongue of this young rhinoceros was &s;oft, like
that of a calf<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mo&s;t voyagers and all naturali&s;ts, both antient and mo|dern, tell us, that the tongue of the rhinoceros is very rough, and its papillae &s;o &s;harp, that, with the tongue alone, he tore the fle&s;h from a man's body even to the bones. This fact, which is every where related, appears to be very &s;u&s;picious and ill imagined; becau&s;e the rhinoceros does not eat fle&s;h, and animals, in general, which have rough tongues, are &s;el|dom carniv$r$us.</NOTE>. His eyes had no vivacity: In
<PB N="101" REF="115">
figure, they re&s;embled tho&s;e of the hog, and
were &s;ituated lower, or nearer the no&s;trils, than
in any other quadruped. His ears are large,
thin at the extremities, and contracted at their
origin by a kind of annular rugo&s;ity. The neck
is very &s;hort, and &s;urrounded with two large
folds of &s;kin. The &s;houlders are very thick,
and, at their juncture, there is another fold of
&s;kin, which de&s;cends upon the fore legs. The
body of this young rhinoceros was very thick,
and pretty much re&s;embled that of a cow about
to bring forth. Between the body and crupper
there is another fold, which de&s;cends upon the
hind legs. La&s;tly, another fold tran&s;ver&s;ely &s;ur|rounds
the inferior part of the crupper, at &s;ome
di&s;tance from the tail. The belly was large, and
hang near the ground, particularly its middle
part. The legs are round, thick, &s;trong, and
their joint bended backwards. This joint,
which, when the animal lies, is covered with a
remarkable fold of the &s;kin, appears when he
&s;tands. The tail is thin, and proportionally
&s;hort; that of the rhinoceros &s;o often mention|ed,
exceeded not &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen inches in
length. It turns a little thicker at the extremity,
which is garni&s;hed with &s;ome &s;hort, thick, hard
hairs. The form of the penis is very extraor|dinary.
It is contained in a prepuce or &s;heath,
like that of the hor&s;e; and the fir&s;t thing that
appears in the time of erection, is a &s;econd pre|puce,
of a fle&s;h-colour, from which there i&s;&s;ues
<PB N="102" REF="116">
a hollow tube, in the form of a funnel cut and
bordered &s;omewhat like a $lower de luce<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Phil. Tran&s;. No. 470. pl. 111. Edwards Gleanings.</NOTE>, and
con&s;titutes the glans and extremity of the penis.
This anomalous glans is of a paler fle&s;h-colour
than the &s;econd prepuce. In the mo&s;t vigorous
erection, the penis extends not above eight in|ches
out of the body; and it is ea&s;ily procured
by rubbing the animal with a handful of &s;traw
when he lies at his ea&s;e. The direction of this
organ is not &s;traight, but bended backward.
Hence he throws out his urine behind; and,
from this circum&s;tance, it may be inferred, that
the male covers not the female, but that they u|nite
with their cruppers to each other. The fe|male
organs are &s;ituated like tho&s;e of the cow,
and &s;he exactly re&s;embles the male in figure and
gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of body. The &s;kin is &s;o thick and im|penetrable,
that, when a man lays hold of any
of the folds, he would imagine he is touching a
wooden plank of half an inch thick. When
tanned, Dr Grew remarks, it is exce&s;&s;ively hard,
and thicker than the hide of any other terre&s;tri|al
animal. It is every where covered more or
le&s;s with incru&s;tations in the form of galls or
tubero&s;ities, which are pretty &s;mall on the top
of the neck and back, but become larger on the &s;ides.
The large&s;t are on the &s;houlders and
crupper, are &s;till pretty large on the thighs and
legs, upon which they are &s;pread all round, and
even on the feet. But, between the folds, the
<PB N="103" REF="117">
&s;kin is penetrable, delicate, and as &s;oft to the
touch as &s;ilk, while the external part of the
fold is equally hard with the re&s;t. This tender
&s;kin between the folds is of a light fle&s;h-colour;
and the &s;kin of the belly is nearly of the &s;ame
colour and con&s;i&s;tence. The&s;e galls or tubero&s;i|ties
&s;hould not be compared, as &s;ome authors
have done, to &s;cales. They are only &s;imple in|durations
of the &s;kin, without any regularity in
their figure, or &s;ymmetry in their re&s;pective po|&s;itions.
The flexibility of the &s;kin in the folds
enables the rhinoceros to move with facility his
head, neck, and members. The whole body,
except at the joints, is inflexible, and re&s;embles a
coat of mail. Dr Par&s;ons remarks, that this animal
li&s;tened with a deep and long continued atten|tion
to any kind of noi&s;e; and that, though he
was &s;leeping, eating, or obeying any other pre&s;|&s;ing
demands of nature, he rai&s;ed his head, and
li&s;tened till the noi&s;e cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>In fine, after giving this accurate de&s;cription
of the rhinoceros, Dr Par&s;ons examines whe|ther
the rhinoceros, with a double horn, exi&s;ts;
and, having compared the te&s;timonies of the an|tients
and moderns, and the remains of this va|riety
in the collections of natural objects, he,
with much probability, concludes, that the rhinoce|ro&s;es
of A&s;ia have commonly but one horn, and
that tho&s;e of Africa have generally two.</P>
<P>It is unque&s;tionably true, that &s;ome rhinoce|ro&s;es
have but one horn, and that others have
<PB N="104" REF="118">
two<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Kolben a&s;&s;erts po&s;itively, and as if he had been an eye witne&s;s, that the fir&s;t horn of the rhinoceros is upon the no&s;e, and the &s;econd upon the front, in a right line with the fir&s;t; that the latter, which is brown, never exceeds two feet in length; and that the &s;econd is yellow, and &s;eldom longer than &s;ix inches; <HI>De&s;cript. du Cap de Bonne E&s;perance, tom. 3. p.</HI> 17.&mdash;But we have already mentioned double horns, the &s;econd differing very little from the fir&s;t, which was two feet long, and both were of the &s;ame colour. Be&s;ides, it appears to be certain, that they are never at &s;uch a di&s;tance from each other, as this author has placed them; for the ba&s;es of the two horns, pre&s;erved in the cabinet of Sir Hans Sloane, were not three inches a&s;under.</NOTE>. But it is not equally certain that this
variety is con&s;tant, and depends on the climate
of Africa or India; or that this difference is alone
&s;ufficient to con&s;titute two di&s;tinct &s;pecies. It
appears that the rhinocero&s;es, with one horn,
have this excre&s;cence always longer than tho&s;e
with two. There are &s;ingle horns of three and
a half, and perhaps of above four feet in length,
by &s;ix or &s;even inches diameter at the ba&s;e. Some
double horns are two feet long<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ur&s;us cornu gemino;</HI> Martial. &s;pectac. ep. 22. Phil. Tran&s;. abrid. vol. 9. p. 100. vol. 11. p. 910. Phil.

are commonly of a brown or olive colour;
though there are in&s;tances of their being gray,

in form of a cup under the ba&s;e, by which
they are fixed to the &s;kin of the no&s;e. The re&s;t
of the horn is &s;olid and harder than common
horn. It is with this weapon that the rhinoce|ros
<PB N="105" REF="119">
is &s;aid to attack and &s;ometimes mortally
wound the large&s;t elephants, who&s;e tall legs give
the rhinoceros an opportunity of &s;triking, with
his &s;nout and horn, their bellies, where the &s;kin
is mo&s;t tender and penetrable. But, if he mi&s;&s;es
his fir&s;t blow, the elephant throws him on the
ground and kills him.</P>
<P>The horn of the rhinoceros is more e&s;teemed
by the Indians than the ivory of the elephant,
not on account of its real utility, though they make &s;everal toys of it with the chi&s;el and tur|ner's

Tho&s;e who are accu&s;tomed to hunt the rhinoceros find means, however, to de|fend them&s;elves from his fury; for he is fond of mar&s;hy grounds; they ob&s;erve when he repairs thither, and, concealing them&s;elves among the bu&s;hes oppo&s;ite to the direction of the wind, they watch till he lies down either to &s;leep or to wallow, that they may have an opportunity of &s;hooting him near the ears, where alone he can receive a mortal wound.

hunters, in&s;tead of attacking him face to face,
follow him at a di&s;tance by the tracks of his
feet, and watch till he lies down to &s;leep. We
have, in the royal cabinet, a foetus of a rhino|ceros,
which was extracted from the body of
the mother, and &s;ent to us from the i&s;land of
Java. By the memoir which accompanied this
foetus, we are informed, that twenty-eight hun|ters
having a&s;&s;embled to attack the mother, they
followed her at a di&s;tance for &s;ome days, de|taching
one or two of their number, from time

a&s;leep, and &s;ilently approached &s;o near, that the
whole twenty-eight mu&s;kets were di&s;charged at
once into the lower part of her belly.</P>
<P>From the de&s;cription given by Dr Par&s;ons, it
appears that this animal has an acute and very
attentive ear. We are likewi&s;e a&s;&s;ured that his
<PB N="113" REF="127">
&s;en&s;e of &s;melling is excellent. But it is &s;aid,
that his eyes are not good, and that he &s;ees &s;uch
objects only as are before him<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See the preceding Note.&mdash;The eyes of the rhinoceros are very &s;mall, and he &s;ees only forward. When he walks, or pur&s;ues his prey, he proceeds always in a direct line, forcing, overturning, and piercing through every ob&s;truction that falls in his way. Neither bu&s;hes, nor trees, nor thickets of brambles, nor large &s;tones, can turn him from his cour&s;e. With the horn on his no&s;e, he tears up trees, rui&s;es &s;tones high in the air, and throws them behind him to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, and with a great noi&s;e: In a word, he overthrows every ob|ject which he can lay hold of. When he is enraged, and meets with no ob&s;truction, lowering his head, he plows the ground, and throws large quantities of earth over his head. He grunts like a hog: His cry, when in a &s;tate of tranquillity, does not reach far; but, when in pur&s;uit of his prey, it may be heard at a great di&s;tance; <HI>De&s;cript. du Cape de Bonne-e&s;pe|rance, par Kolbe.</HI></NOTE>. The extreme
minutene&s;s of his eyes, their low, oblique, and
deep &s;ituation, the dullne&s;s, and the &s;mall de|gree
of motion they &s;eem to po&s;&s;e&s;s, tend to con|firm
this fact. His voice, when he is in a &s;tate
of tranquillity, is blunt, and re&s;embles the grunt|ing
of a hog; but, when enraged, it becomes
&s;harp, and is heard at a great di&s;tance. Though
he lives on vegetables only, he does not rumi|nate.
Hence it is probable, that, like the ele|phant,
he has but one &s;tomach, and capacious
bowels, which &s;upply the place of many &s;to|machs.
His con&s;umption of food, though con|&s;iderable,
is not near &s;o great as that of the ele|phant;

<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>I have &s;een a &s;econd rhinoceros, which was
lately brought to the royal menagerie. In the
month of September 1770, if the people who
conducted it can be credited, the animal was
only three months old. But, I am per&s;uaded,
that it was at lea&s;t two or three years of age;
for its body, including the head, was already
eight feet two inches long, five feet &s;ix inches
high, and eight feet two inches in circumfe|rence.
A year afterward, its body was length|ened
&s;even, inches; &s;o that, on the 28th day of
Augu&s;t 1771, it was eight feet nine inches, in|cluding
the length of the head, five feet nine
inches high, and eight feet nine inches in cir|cumference.
On the 12th day of Augu&s;t 1772,
the length of the body, comprehending the head,
was nine feet four inches, the height of the
cr$pper &s;ix feet four inches, and that of the wi|thers
only five feet eleven inches. Its &s;kin had
the colour and appearance of an old elm tree,
&s;potted in &s;ome places with black and gray, and
$word$ doubled into deep furrows, which form|$$
$word$ of &s;cales. It had only one horn, the
<PB N="115" REF="129">
colour of which was brown, and its &s;ub&s;tance &s;olid and hard. The eyes were &s;mall and pro|minent,
the ears large, and pretty &s;imilar to
tho&s;e of an a&s;s. The back, which was hollow
or depre&s;&s;ed, &s;eemed to be covered with a natu|ral
&s;addle. The legs were &s;hort and very thick.
The feet were rounded behind, and divided be|fore
into three hoofs. The tail re&s;embled that
of an ox, and was garni&s;hed with black hairs at
the extremity. The penis lay along the te&s;ti|cles,
and erected it&s;elf for the di&s;charge of urine,
which the animal threw out to a great di&s;tance.
The point of it was al&s;o very remarkable, form|ing
a cavity like the mouth of a trumpet. The
&s;heath from which it i&s;&s;ues is fle&s;hy, and of a
vermilion colour, like the penis it&s;elf. This
fle&s;hy &s;ub&s;tance which formed the fir&s;t tube,
came out of a &s;econd &s;heath compo&s;ed of &s;kin,
as in other quadrupeds. The tongue is &s;o hard
and rough, that it tears off the &s;kin of any per|&s;on
whom it licks; hence this animal eats large
thorns, without feeling any pain. The rhinoce|ros
requires one hundred and &s;ixty pounds of
food every day. His fle&s;h is much reli&s;hed by
the Indians and Africans, and e&s;pecially by the
Hottentots. If trained when young, he might
be rendered dome&s;tic, and, in this &s;tate, he would
multiply more ea&s;ily than the elephant.</P>
<P>&startq;I could never di&s;cover the rea&s;on (M. P. re|marks)
why in A&s;ia the rhinoceros is allowed
<PB N="116" REF="130">
to remain in a wild &s;tate, while in Aby&s;&s;inia
he is rendered dome&s;tic, and is employed in

<P>&startq; M. de Buffon,&endq; &s;ays Mr Bruce, &startq;conjectured
that there were, in the interior parts of Africa,
rhinocero&s;es with two horns. This conjecture
is fully verified; for all the rhinocero&s;es I &s;aw
in Aby&s;&s;inia had two horns. The fir&s;t, that is,
the one neare&s;t the no&s;e, is of the common
form; the &s;econd is &s;harp at the point, and
always &s;horter than the fir&s;t. Both &s;pring at
the &s;ame time; but the fir&s;t grows more quick|ly,
and exceeds the other in &s;ize, not only du|ring
the time of growth, but during the whole
life of the animal<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Note communicated by Mr Bruce to M. de Buffon.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>On the other hand, M. Allamand, a very able
naturali&s;t, wrote to M. Daubenton a letter, dated
at Leyden, October 31. 1766, in the following
terms:</P>
<P>&startq;I recollect a remark of M. Par&s;ons, in a
pa&s;&s;age quoted by M. de Buffon: He &s;u&s;pect|ed
that the rhinocero&s;es of A&s;ia have but one
horn, and that tho&s;e of the Cape of Good
Hope have two. I &s;u&s;pect the very oppo&s;ite:
The heads of the rhinocero&s;es which I received
from Bengal and other parts of India, had al|ways double horns, and all tho&s;e which came

chief, and perhaps the only &s;en&s;ible character by

the camel has two bunches on the back, and the
dromedary but one. The latter is al&s;o &s;omewhat
&s;maller and weaker than the camel. But both
<PB N="120" REF="135">
of them intermix and produce; and the indivi|duals

races, are the mo&s;t vigorous, and preferred to all

an effect of their &s;tructure. Independent
of the four &s;tomachs, which are common to ru|minating
animals, the camels have a fifth bag,
which &s;erves them as a re&s;ervoir for water.
This fifth &s;tomach is peculiar to the camel. It
is &s;o large as to contain a va&s;t quantity of wa|ter,
where it remains without corrupting, or
mixing with the other aliments. When the
animal is pre&s;&s;ed with thir&s;t, and has occa&s;ion
for water to macerate his dry food in rumina|ting,
he makes part of this water mount into his
<PB N="135" REF="150">
paunch, or even as high as the oe&s;ophagus, by
a &s;imple contraction of certain mu&s;cles. It is
by this &s;ingular con&s;truction that the camel is
enabled to pa&s;s &s;everal days without drinking,
and to take at a time a prodigious quantity of
water, which remains in the re&s;ervoir pure and
limpid, becau&s;e neither the liquors of the body,
nor the juices of dige&s;tion, can mix with it.</P>
<P>If we reflect on the di&s;&s;imilarities in this ani|mal
from other quadrupeds, we cannot doubt
that his nature has been con&s;iderably changed
by con&s;traint, &s;lavery, and perpetual labour. Of
all animals, the camel is the mo&s;t antient, the
complete&s;t, and the mo&s;t laborious &s;lave. He is
the mo&s;t antient &s;lave, becau&s;e he inhabits tho&s;e
climates where men were fir&s;t poli&s;hed. He is
the mo&s;t complete &s;lave, becau&s;e, in the other
&s;pecies of dome&s;tic animals, as the hor&s;e, the dog,
the ox, the &s;heep, the hog, &amp;c. we &s;till find in|dividuals
in a &s;tate of nature, and which have
never &s;ubmitted to men. But the whole &s;pecies
of the camel is en&s;laved; for none of them ex|i&s;t
in their primitive &s;tate of liberty and indepen|dence.
La&s;tly, he is the mo&s;t laborious &s;lave;
becau&s;e he has never been nouri&s;hed for pomp,
like mo&s;t hor&s;es, nor for amu&s;ement, like mo&s;t
dogs, nor for the u&s;e of the table, like the ox,
the hog, and the &s;heep; becau&s;e he has always
been made a bea&s;t of burden, whom men have
never taken the trouble of yoking in machines,
but have regarded the body of the animal as a
<PB N="136" REF="151">
living carriage, which they may load, or overload,
even during &s;leep; for, when pre&s;&s;ed, the load
is &s;ometimes not taken off, but he lies down to
&s;leep under it, with his legs folded<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In the night, the camels &s;leep on their knees, and rumi|nate what they have eaten during the day; <HI>Voyage du P. Philippe, p.</HI> 369.</NOTE>, and his
body re&s;ting on his &s;tomach. Hence they per|petually
bear the marks of &s;ervitude and pain.
Upon the under part of the brea&s;t, there is a
large callo&s;ity as hard as horn, and &s;imilar ones
on the joints of the limbs. Though the&s;e callo|&s;ities
are found on all camels, they exhibit a
proof that they are not natural, but produced by
exce&s;&s;ive con&s;traint and painful labour; for they
are often filled with pus<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Having opened the callo&s;ities on the legs to examine their &s;tructure, which is a medium between fat and ligament, we found, in a &s;mall camel, that &s;ome of them contained a collection of thick pus. The callo&s;ity on the &s;ternum was eight inches long, &s;ix broad, and two thick. In it likewi&s;e we found a great deal of pus; <HI>Mem. pour &s;ervir &agrave; l'hi&s;t. des animaux, part. 1. p.</HI> 74.</NOTE>. The brea&s;t and legs,
therefore, are deformed by callo&s;ities; the back
is &s;till more disfigured by one or two bunches.
The callo&s;ities, as well as the bunches, are per|petuated
by generation. As it is obvious, that
the fir&s;t deformity proceeds from the con&s;tant
practice of forcing the&s;e animals, from their ear|lie&s;t
age<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">As &s;oon as a camel is brought forth, his four legs are folded under his body. After which, he is covered with a cloth, which hangs down to the ground, and on the borders of which a quantity of &s;tones are laid, to prevent him from ri&s;ing, and in this po&s;ition he remains fifteen or twenty days. He is &s;erved with milk, but very &s;paringly, in order to ac|cu&s;tom him to drink little; <HI>Voyage it Tavernier, tom. 1. p.</HI> 161.</NOTE>, to lie on their &s;tomach, with their limbs
<PB N="137" REF="152">
folded under the body, and, in this &s;ituation, to
bear both the weight of their own bodies, and
that of the loads laid on their backs, we ought
to pre&s;ume that the bunch or bunches have al&s;o
originated from the unequal pre&s;&s;ure of heavy
burdens, which would naturally make the fle&s;h,
fat, and &s;kin &s;well; for the&s;e bunches are not
o&s;&s;eous, but compo&s;ed of a fle&s;hy &s;ub&s;tance &s;imi|lar
to that of a cow's udder<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The fle&s;h of the camel is in&s;ipid, e&s;pecially that of the bunch, the ta&s;te of which re&s;embles that of a fat cow's udder; <HI>L'Afrique de Marmol, tom. 1. p.</HI> 50.</NOTE>. Hence the cal|lo&s;ities
and bunches &s;hould be equally regarded
as deformities produced by continual labour and
bodily con&s;traint; and, though at fir&s;t accidental
and individual, they are now become permanent
and common to the whole &s;pecies. We may
likewi&s;e pre&s;ume, that the bag which contains
the water, and is only an appendix to the paunch,
has been produced by an unnatural exten&s;ion of
this vi&s;cus. The animal, after &s;uffering thir&s;t
for a long time, by taking at once as much, and
perhaps more water than the &s;tomach could ea|&s;ily
contain, this membrane would be gradually
extended and dilated; in the &s;ame manner as
we have &s;een the &s;tomach of a &s;heep extend in
proportion to the quantity of its aliment. In
&s;heep fed with grain, the &s;tomach is very &s;mall;
<PB N="138" REF="153">
but becomes very large in tho&s;e fed with her|bage

<P>The&s;e conjectures would be either fully con|firmed
or de&s;troyed, if we had wild camels to
compare with the dome&s;tic. But the&s;e animals
no where exi&s;t in a natural &s;tate, or, if they do,
no man has ob&s;erved or de&s;cribed them. We
ought to &s;uppo&s;e, therefore, that every thing
good and beautiful belongs to Nature, and that
whatever is defective and deformed in the&s;e ani|mals
proceeds from the labours and &s;lavery im|po&s;ed
on them by the empire of man. The&s;e
inoffen&s;ive creatures mu&s;t &s;uffer much; for they
utter the mo&s;t lamentable cries, e&s;pecially when

<P>&startq;In the country of Iman, mo&s;t of the camels
are of a middle &s;tature, and of a bright brown
colour; &s;ome of them, however, are large,
heavy, and of a deep brown colour. When
about to copulate, the female lies down on her
legs; and the people tie her fore legs to pre|vent
her from ri&s;ing. The male &s;its on his
po&s;teriors like a dog, with his two fore feet
re&s;ting on the ground. He &s;eems to be cold|er
and more indifferent than any other animal;
for he often requires to be teazed a long time
before the ardour of love is excited. When
the operation is fini&s;hed, the female is &s;udden|ly
rai&s;ed, and forced to walk. The &s;ame thing,
it is &s;aid, takes place in Me&s;opotamia, Natolia,
and probably every where el&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>I remarked, that camels had been tran&s;ported
to the Canaries, Antilles, and Peru; but that they
had not &s;ucceeded in any part of the New World.
Dr Brown, in his hi&s;tory of Jamaica, affirms, that
he &s;aw dromedaries there, which the Engli&s;h, in
former times, had tran&s;ported thither in great
numbers, and that, though they &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t, they
are of little u&s;e; becau&s;e the inhabitants are ig|norant
of the proper manner of feeding and
treating the&s;e animals. They, however, multi|ply
in all the&s;e climates, and I doubt not but
they might produce even in France. We &s;ee
from the Gazette of June 9. 1775, that M. Brin|kenof

copulate in his territories near Berlin, obtained
on the 24th day of March 1775, after a period of
twelve months, a young camel, which was healthy
and vigorous. This fact confirms what I &s;aid
concerning the production of dromedaries and
camels at Dre&s;den; and I am per&s;uaded, that, if
we had Arabian &s;ervants, who know how to
manage the&s;e animals, we might &s;oon render this
&s;pecies dome&s;tic, which I con&s;ider as the mo&s;t

has no name in the languages of the&s;e people.
Even the word <HI>Buffalo</HI> indicates a foreign ori|gin;
for it has no root either in Greek or Latin.
In a word, this animal is a native of the warm
<PB N="152" REF="169">
regions of Africa and the Indies, and was not
tran&s;ported and naturalized in Italy till about
the &s;eventh century. The moderns have im|properly
applied to him the name <HI>bubalus,</HI> which,
indeed, denotes an African animal, but very dif|ferent
from the buffalo, as might be &s;hown from
many pa&s;&s;ages of antient authors. If the buba|lus
were to be referred to a particular genus, he
would rather belong to that of the antilope than
to that of the ox. Belon, having &s;een at Cairo
a &s;mall ox with a bunch on its back, which dif|fered
from the buffalo and common ox, imagined
that it might be the bubalus of the antients.
But, if he had carefully compared the characters
given by the antients to the bubalus, with tho&s;e
of this &s;mall ox, he would have di&s;covered his
error. Be&s;ides, we are enabled to &s;peak of it
with certainty; for we have &s;een it alive; and,
after comparing the de&s;cription we have given of
it with that of Belon, we cannot he&s;itate in pro|nouncing
it to be the &s;ame animal. It was ex|hibited
at the fair of Paris in the year 1752,
under the name of <HI>Zebu,</HI> which we have adopt|ed
to denote this animal, becau&s;e it is a parti|cular
race of the ox, and not a &s;pecies of the
buffalo or bubalus.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="170">
Ari&s;totle, when treating of oxen, mentions
not the common ox, but only remarks, that, a|mong
the <HI>Arachotas</HI> in India, there are wild
oxen, which differ from the dome&s;tic kind as
much as the wild boar differs from the common
hog. But, in another place, as quoted above
in the notes, he gives a de&s;cription of a wild ox
in Poeonia, a province bordering on Macedonia,
which he calls <HI>bona&s;us.</HI> Thus the common ox
and the bona&s;us are the only animals of this kind
mentioned by Ari&s;totle; and, what, is &s;ingular,
the bona&s;us, though fully de&s;cribed by this great
philo&s;opher, was unknown to the Greek and
Latin naturali&s;ts who wrote after him; for they
have all copied him verbatim on this &s;ubject:
So that, at pre&s;ent, we only know the name <HI>bo|na&s;us,</HI>
without being able to di&s;tingui&s;h the ani|mal
to which it ought to be applied. If we
con&s;ider, however, that Ari&s;totle, when &s;peaking
of the wild oxen of temperate climates, mentions
the bona&s;us only, and that, on the contrary, the
Greeks and Latins of after ages take no notice of
the bona&s;us, but point out the&s;e wild oxen under
the appellations of <HI>urus</HI> and <HI>bi&s;on,</HI> we will be in|duced
to think that the bona&s;us mu&s;t be either
the one or the other of the&s;e animals; and, in|deed,
by comparing what Ari&s;totle has &s;aid of
the bona&s;us, with what we know concerning the
bi&s;on, it is probable that the&s;e two names denote
the &s;ame animal. The urus is fir&s;t mentioned
by Julius Cae&s;ar; Pliny and Pau&s;anias are al&s;o
<PB N="154" REF="171">
the fir&s;t who announced the bi&s;on. From the
time of Pliny, the name <HI>bubalus</HI> has been indi&s;|criminately
applied to the urus or the bi&s;on.
Confu&s;ion always augments as time advances.
To the bona&s;us, bubalus, urus, and bi&s;on, have
been added the <HI>catopleba,</HI> the <HI>thur,</HI> the bubalus
of Belon, the Scots and American bi&s;ons; and
all our naturali&s;ts have made as many different
&s;pecies as they have found names. Here truth is
&s;o environed with darkne&s;s and error, that it will
be difficult to elucidate this part of natural hi&s;to|ry,
which the contrariety of evidence, the varie|ty
of de&s;criptions, the multiplicity of denomina|tions,
the diver&s;ity of places, the differences of
languages, and the ob&s;curity of time, &s;eemed to
have condemned to perpetual darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>I &s;hall fir&s;t give my opinion on this &s;ubject,
and afterwards produce the proofs of it.</P>
<P>1. The animal we call <HI>buffalo</HI> was unknown
to the antients.</P>
<P>2. The buffalo, now dome&s;tic in Europe, is
the &s;ame as the dome&s;tic or wild buffalo of In|dia
and Africa.</P>
<P>3. The <HI>bubalus</HI> of the Greeks and Romans
is neither the buffalo nor the &s;mall ox of Belon,
but the animal de&s;cribed in the Memoirs of the
Academy of Sciences under the name of the
<HI>Barbary cow,</HI> and which we call <HI>bubalus.</HI></P>
<P>4. The &s;mall ox of Belon, which we have
&s;een, and di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name <HI>zebu,</HI> is on|ly
a variety of the common ox.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="172">
5. The <HI>bona&s;us</HI> of Ari&s;totle is the &s;ame ani|mal
with the bi&s;on of the Latins.</P>
<P>6. The <HI>bi&s;on</HI> of America might proceed ori|ginally
from the European bi&s;on.</P>
<P>7. The <HI>urus</HI> or <HI>aurochs</HI> is the &s;ame animal
with the common bull in its natural and wild
&s;tate.</P>
<P>8. The bi&s;on differs from the aurochs by
accidental varieties only; and, con&s;equently,
it is, as well as the aurochs, of the &s;ame &s;pecies
with the dome&s;tic ox; &s;o that I think I &s;hall be
able to reduce all the denominations, and all the
pretended &s;pecies both of antient and modern
naturali&s;ts, to three, namely, the ox, the buffalo,
and the bubalus.</P>
<P>Some of the propo&s;itions I am about to lay
down, will, I doubt not, appear to be mere a&s;|&s;ertions,
particularly to tho&s;e who have been ac|cu&s;tomed
to &s;tudy the nomenclators of animals,
or have attempted to give li&s;ts of them. There
are none of the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions, however, which I
am not able to prove. But, before entering in|to
critical di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, each of which requires
particular propo&s;itions, I shall relate the facts and
remarks which led me into this re&s;earch; and,
as they have &s;atisfied my&s;elf, I hope they will be
equally &s;atisfactory to others.</P>
<P>Dome&s;tic animals differ, in many re&s;pects,
from wild animals. Their nature, their &s;ize,
and their form are more fluctuating, and &s;ubject
to greater changes, e&s;pecially in the external
<PB N="156" REF="173">
parts of the body. The influence of climate,
which acts powerfully upon all Nature, exerts it|&s;elf
with greater efficacy upon captive than upon
free animals. Food prepared by the hand of
man, which is often ill cho&s;en, and &s;paringly ad|mini&s;tered,
joined to the inclemency of a foreign
&s;ky, produce, in the progre&s;s of time, alterations
&s;o deeply engraven that they become con&s;tant,
and are tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity. I pretend not
to maintain, that this general cau&s;e of change is
&s;o powerful as to alter e&s;&s;entially the nature of
beings, who&s;e con&s;titution is &s;o permanently fix|ed
as that of animals. But it transforms and
ma&s;ks their external appearance; it annihilates
&s;ome parts, and gives ri&s;e to others; it paints
them with various colours; and, by its action on
the temperament of the body, it has an influence
on the di&s;po&s;itions, in&s;tincts, and other internal
qualities. The modification of a &s;ingle part, in
a machine &s;o perfect as that of an animal's body,
is &s;ufficient to make the whole feel the effects of
the alteration. It is for this rea&s;on that our
dome&s;tic animals differ nearly as much in di&s;po|&s;itions
and in&s;tincts, as in figure, from tho&s;e who
enjoy their natural &s;tate of freedom. Of this
the &s;heep affords a &s;triking example. This &s;pe|cies,
in its pre&s;ent condition, could not exi&s;t
without the care and defence of man: It is al&s;o
much changed, and very inferior to its original
&s;pecies. But, not to depart from our chief ob|ject,
we &s;ee how many alterations the ox has
<PB N="157" REF="174">
undergone, from the combined effects of climate,
food, and management, in a wild, and in a do|me&s;tic
&s;tate.</P>
<P>The bunch which &s;ome oxen carry between
their &s;houlders, both in a dome&s;tic and wild &s;tate,
is the mo&s;t general and mo&s;t remarkable variety.
This race of oxen are denominated <HI>bi&s;ons;</HI> and,
it has been imagined, till now, that they were of
a different &s;pecies from the common ox. But,
as we are certain that the&s;e animals produce
with the common kind, and that the bunch
dimini&s;hes from the fir&s;t generation, and di&s;ap|pears
in the &s;econd or third, it is evident, that
this bunch is only an accidental and variable
character, which prevents not the bunched ox
from belonging to the &s;ame &s;pecies with our ox.
Now, in the de&s;ert parts of Europe, there were,
in antient times, wild oxen, &s;ome of them with
bunches, and others without bunches. Hence
this variety &s;eems to be natural, and to proceed
from the abundance and more &s;ub&s;tantial quality
of the food; for we remarked, when treating of
the camels, that, when meagre and ill fed, they
have not even the lea&s;t ve&s;tige of a bunch. The
ox without a bunch was called <HI>vrochs</HI> and <HI>tu|rochs</HI>
in the language of the Germans, and, in
the &s;ame language, the bunched ox was called
<HI>vi&s;en.</HI> The Romans, who knew neither of the&s;e
wild oxen till they &s;aw them in Germany, a|dopted
their German names. From <HI>vrochs</HI> they
made <HI>vrus,</HI> and from <HI>vi&s;en, bi&s;on.</HI> They never
<PB N="158" REF="175">
imagined that the wild ox de&s;cribed by Ari&s;totle,
under the name of <HI>bona&s;us,</HI> could be one or o|ther
of the&s;e oxen who&s;e names they had Lati|nized.</P>
<P>The length of the hair is another difference
between the aurochs and bi&s;on. The neck, the
&s;houlders, and the throat of the bi&s;on, are cover|ed
with very long hair. But, in the aurochs, all
the&s;e parts are covered with &s;hort hair, &s;imilar to
that on the re&s;t of the body, except the front,
which is covered with cri&s;ped hair. This diffe|rence
of the hair, however, is &s;till more acciden|tal
than that of the bunch, and depends likewi&s;e
on the food and the climate, as we have proved
under the articles Goat, Sheep, Dog, Cat, Rab|bit,
&amp;c. Thus, neither the bunch, nor the dif|ference
in the length of the hair, are &s;pecific cha|racters,
but accidental varieties only.</P>
<P>A more exten&s;ive variety than the other two
ari&s;es from the figure of the horns; to which
character naturali&s;ts have a&s;cribed more impor|tance
than it de&s;erves. They have not con&s;ider|ed,
that, in our dome&s;tic cattle, the figure, the
&s;ize, the po&s;ition, the direction, and even the
number of the horns vary &s;o greatly, that it is
impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain what is the real model of
Nature. In &s;ome cows, the horns are much
crooked, and hang &s;o low as to be almo&s;t pendu|lous;
in others, they are more erect, longer, and
more elevated. There are entire races of ewes
with &s;ometimes two, &s;ometimes four horns; and
<PB N="159" REF="176">
there are races of cows without horns. The&s;e
external, or, as they may be called, acce&s;&s;ory
parts of the body, are as fluctuating as the co|lours
of the hair, which, in dome&s;tic animals,
are varied and combined in every po&s;&s;ible man|ner.
This difference in the figure and direction
of the horns, which is &s;o frequent, ought not,
therefore, to be regarded as a di&s;tinctive character
of &s;pecies. It is, however, the only character
which our naturali&s;ts have adopted in their &s;pe|cies;
and, as Ari&s;totle, in his de&s;cription of the
bona&s;us, &s;ays, that its horns bended inwards,
they have, from this con&s;ideration alone, and
without having ever &s;een the individual, &s;epa|rated
it from the re&s;t, and made it a di&s;tinct
&s;pecies. In this variation of the horns of do|me&s;tic
animals, we have confined our remarks

<P>The mutilation of animals by ca&s;tration &s;eems
to injure the individual only, and to have no in|fluence
on the &s;pecies. It is certain, however,
that this practice re&s;trains Nature on the one
hand, and weakens her on the other. A &s;ingle
male, obliged to &s;erve thirty or forty females,
mu&s;t be enfeebled; be&s;ides, the ardour of love
is unequal. It is cool in the male, who exerts
him&s;elf beyond the bounds of Nature, and too
ardent in the female, who&s;e enjoyment is limit|ed
<PB N="160" REF="177">
to an in&s;tant. Of cour&s;e, the offspring mu&s;t
be chiefly tinctured with the feminine qualities;
more females will be produced than males; and
even the males will partake more of the mother
than the father. This is unque&s;tionably the
rea&s;on why more girls than boys are brought
forth in tho&s;e countries where the men have a
great number of wives. On the contrary, in all
countries where the men are allowed but one
wife, more males are produced than females. It
is true, that, in dome&s;tic animals, the fine&s;t males
are &s;elected to become the fathers of an offspring
&s;o numerous. The fir&s;t productions from the&s;e
males will be &s;trong and vigorous. But, in pro|portion
to the number of copies taken from the
&s;ame mould, the original impre&s;&s;ion of Nature
will be deformed, or at lea&s;t rendered le&s;s per|fect.
The race mu&s;t, therefore, degenerate and
become more feeble. This, perhaps, is the rea|&s;on
why more mon&s;ters are produced among
dome&s;tic than wild animals, where the number
of males is equal to that of the females. Be&s;ides,
when one male is obliged to &s;erve many females,
they have not the liberty of following their own
ta&s;te. They are deprived of that gaiety, and
tho&s;e &s;oft emotions which proceed from &s;ponta|neous
plea&s;ures. The fire of their love is half
extingui&s;hed; and they langui&s;h, waiting for
the cold approaches of a male whom they have
not &s;elected, who is often not accommodated to
them, and who always flatters le&s;s than one that
<PB N="161" REF="178">
is obliged to care&s;s, in order to obtain a prefe|rence.
The&s;e melancholy and ta&s;tele&s;s amours
mu&s;t give ri&s;e to productions equally di&s;mal and
in&s;ipid; beings who never have that courage,
&s;pirit, and &s;trength, which Nature can only be|&s;tow
on each &s;pecies, by leaving all the indivi|duals
in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their powers, and, a|bove
all, of the liberty of choice in the rencoun|ters
between the &s;exes. We learn from the ex|ample
of hor&s;es, that cro&s;&s;ed races are always the
mo&s;t beautiful. We ought not, therefore, to
confine our female cattle to a &s;ingle male of
their own country, who already has too much
re&s;emblance to his mother, and who, con&s;e|quently,
in&s;tead of improving, continues to de|grade
the &s;pecies. Man, in this article, prefers
his convenience to every other advantage. We
never think of improving or of embelli&s;hing
Nature; but we &s;ubmit to her operations, that
we may enjoy her in a more arbitrary man|ner.
The males con&s;titute the glory of each
&s;pecies. They have more courage, fire, and ob|&s;tinacy.
A great number of males in our flocks
would render them le&s;s tractable, and more diffi|cult
to manage. In tho&s;e &s;laves of the mo&s;t
abject kind, it is even nece&s;&s;ary to depre&s;s every
head that offers to exalt it&s;elf.</P>
<P>To the&s;e cau&s;es of degeneration in dome&s;tic
animals, we mu&s;t &s;till add another, which alone
has produced more changes than all the com|bined
force of the others; I mean, the con&s;tant
<PB N="162" REF="179">
tran&s;portation of tho&s;e animals from climate to
climate. The ox, the &s;heep, the goat, have been
carried to every habitable part of the globe.

of every climate, and have received impre&s;|&s;ions

<P>Having pointed out the general cau&s;es of the
varieties among dome&s;tic animals, I &s;hall now
exhibit the particular proofs of what I advanced
concerning the oxen and buffalos.</P>
<P>1. I remarked, <HI>That the animal we now know
by the name of buffalo, was unknown to the an|tient
Greeks and Romans.</HI> This po&s;ition is evi|dent;
for in none of their authors is there any
de&s;cription, or even name, which can be applied
to the buffalo. Be&s;ides, we learn from the an|nals
of Italy, that the fir&s;t buffalo was tran&s;port|ed
thither about the end of the &s;ixth century<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Ann. 595. Voyage de Mi&s;&s;on, tom. 3. p. 54.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>2. <HI>The buffalo, now dome&s;tic in Europe, is the
&s;ame with the wild or dome&s;tic buffalo of India
and Africa.</HI> Of this no other proof is nece&s;&s;ary
than a compari&s;on of our de&s;cription of the buf|falo,
which was made from the live animal,
with the notices given by travellers of the
buffalos in Per&s;ia<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Tavernier, tom. 1. pag. 41. et 298.</NOTE>, Mogul<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Relation de The|venot, page 11.</NOTE>, Bengal<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Voyage de l'Hullier, page 30.</NOTE>,

Hope<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">De&s;cription du cap de Bonne-e&s;perance, par Kolbe, tom. 3. p. 25.</NOTE>. It is ea&s;y to perceive, that, in all
the&s;e countries, this animal is the &s;ame, and
differs from our buffalo only by very &s;ight varieties.</P>
<P>3. <HI>The bubalus of the Greeks and Latins is
neither the buffalo, nor the &s;mall ox of Belon, but
the animal de&s;cribed in the Memoirs of the Aca|demy
of Sciences, under the name of the Barbary
Cow.</HI> The following facts will prove this po|&s;ition.
Ari&s;totle<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Genus id fibrarum cervi, damae, bubali &s;anguini dee&s;t; <HI>Ari&s;t. Hi&s;t. Anim. lib. 3. cap.</HI> 6.</NOTE> ranks the bubalus with the &s;tag
and fallow deer, and not with the ox<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Bubalis etiam caprei&s;que interdum co$nua inutilia &s;unt: Nam et&s;i contra nonnulla re&s;i&s;tant, et cornibus &s;e defendant, tamen feroces pugnace&s;que belluas fugiunt; <HI>Idem, de part, ani|mal, lib. 3. cap.</HI> 11.</NOTE>. In
another place, he mentions the bubalus along
with the roe deer; and remarks, that he makes
a bad defence with his horns, and that he flies
from all ferocious animals. Pliny<NOTE N="&Verbar;&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Germania gignit in&s;ignia boum ferorum genera, juba|tos bi&s;ontes excellentique vi et velocitate uros quibus imperi|tum vulgus <HI>bubalorum</HI> nomen impo&s;uit; cum id gignat Afri|ca; vituli potius cervive quadam &s;imilitudine; <HI>Plin.

is an African animal, which re&s;embles, in &s;ome
mea&s;ure, a calf or a &s;tag. Hence the bubalus is
a timid creature, his horns are u&s;ele&s;s to him,
and, to avoid the a&s;&s;aults of ferocious animals,
he has no other re&s;ource but flight; of cour&s;e,
he is nimble, and is related, by his figure, both
to the cow and the &s;tag. All the&s;e characters,
none of which apply to the buffalo, are com|bined
in the animal who&s;e figure was &s;ent by Ho|ratius-Fontana
to Aldrovandus<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Aldrov. de quad. bi&s;ule. p. 365.</NOTE>, and of which
the Gentlemen of the Academy<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mem. pour &s;ervir &agrave; l'hi&s;t. des animaux, part. 2. p. 24.</NOTE> have likewi&s;e
given a figure and de&s;cription, under the name
of the <HI>Barbary cow;</HI> and they agree with me in
thinking, that it is the bubalus of the antients<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">This animal &s;hould rather be regarded as the bubalus of the antients, than the &s;mall African ox de&s;cribed by Belon; <HI>Id. ibid. p.</HI> 26.</NOTE>.
The zebu, or &s;mall ox of Belon, has none of the
characters of the bubalus; for the zebu differs as
much from the bubalus as the ox from the an|tilope;
and Belon is the only naturali&s;t who re|garded
this &s;mall ox as the bubalus of the an|tients.</P>
<P>4. <HI>The &s;mall ox of Belon is only a variety of
the common ox.</HI> This may be ea&s;ily proved by
&s;imply referring to the figure of this animal
given by Belon, Pro&s;per Alpinus, and Edwards,
and to our own de&s;cription of it. We have &s;een
it alive: Its conductor told us, that it came from
<PB N="165" REF="182">
Africa, where it was called <HI>zebu;</HI> that it was do|me&s;tic, and was u&s;ed for riding. It is, indeed, a
very mild, and even a care&s;&s;ing animal. Its fi|gure,
though thick and &s;quat, is agreeable. It
has, however, &s;o perfect a re&s;emblance to the ox,
that I can give no better idea of it, than by re|marking,
that, if a hand&s;ome bull were viewed
through a gla&s;s which dimini&s;hed objects one
half, this contracted figure would be that of the
zebu.</P>
<P>The de&s;cription I made of this animal, in
the year 1752, is in&s;erted below in the note<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This &s;mall ox has a perfect re&s;emblance to that of Belon. Its crupper is round, and plumper than that of the common ox. It is &s;o gentle and familiar, that it licks the hand like a dog, and care&s;&s;es every per&s;on who approaches. It is a very beautiful animal; and its intelligence &s;eems to he equal to its docility. We were informed by its conductor, that it was brought from Africa, and that its age was twenty-one months. Its colour was white, mixed with yellow and a little red. All the legs were white. The hair on the &s;pine of the back, for about a foot wide, is black, and the tail of the &s;ame colour. In the middle of this black band, there is on the crupper a &s;mall white &s;treak, the hairs of which &s;tand erect like bri&s;tles. It had no mane, and there was very little hair on the tuft. The hair of the body is very &s;mooth and &s;hort. It was five feet &s;even inches in length, from the end of the muzzle to the origin of the tail, five feet one inch in circumference behind the fore legs, five feet &s;ix inches at the middle of the body, and five feet one inch above the hind legs. The circumference of the head, taken before the horns, was two feet ten inches, and that of the muzzle, taken behind the no&s;trils, was one foot three inches. The fi&s;&s;ure of the mouth, when &s;hut, was eleven inches. The no&s;trils were two inches long by one broad; and, from the end of the muzzle to the eye mea&s;ured ten inches. The eyes were di&s;tant from each other about &s;ix inches; and from their po&s;terior angle, to the aperture of the ears, mea&s;ured four inches. The ears were &s;ituated behind and a little to one &s;ide of the horns, and were near &s;even inches long, and nine inches in circumference at the ba&s;e. The di&s;tance between the horns was little more than four inches; they were one foot two inches in length, &s;ix inches in circumference at the ba&s;e, and, at half an inch from the points, only an inch and a half. They were of the ordinary colour of horn, and black near the extremi|ties, which were di&s;tant from each other one foot &s;even inches. The bunch, which con&s;i&s;ted entirely of fle&s;h, was &s;even inches in perpendicular height. The colour of the hair which co|vered it was blacki&s;h, and an inch and a half long. The tail, to the end of the vertebrae, was little more than two feet long; but, including the hair, which hangs down to the ground, it was two feet ten inches and a half. The longe&s;t hairs of the tail mea&s;ured one foot three inches. The te&s;ticles were a foot and a half di&s;tant from the anus. It had four paps, &s;ituated like tho&s;e of the bull.</NOTE>.
<PB N="166" REF="183">
It corre&s;ponds very well with the figure and de|&s;cription
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This is a very &s;mall bull; it is thick, fat, &s;mooth, and well &s;haped.....It was already old, though its body was not &s;o large as that of a &s;tag; but it was more &s;quat, and thicker than a roebuck, and &s;o neat and compact in all its members, that it was extremely agreeable to behold......Its feet re&s;embled tho&s;e of the ox; and its legs were &s;hort and &s;quat. Its neck is thick and &s;hort, and the dewlap very &s;mall. It has the head of an ox, and the horns ri&s;e from a bone on the top of the head. They are black, much notched, like tho&s;e of the Gazelle, or Barbary antilope, and formed like a cre&s;cent.... It has the ears of a cow; its &s;houlders are plump, and a little elevated; its tail is long, and covered with black hair. It has the appearance of an ox, only it is not &s;o tall.... We have here given a figure of it.&mdash;Belon adds, that this &s;mall ox was brought to Cairo from Azamia, a province of A&s;ia, and that it is al&s;o found in Africa; <HI>Ob&s;. de Belon, fol.</HI> 118.</NOTE> given by Belon, which I have al&s;o
<PB N="167" REF="184">
in&s;erted, that the reader may have an oportuni|ty
of comparing them. Pro&s;per Alpinus<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Pro&s;p. Alpin. Hi&s;t. Nat. Aegypt. p. 233.</NOTE>, who
de&s;cribes this animal, and gives a figure of it,
&s;ays that it is found in Egypt. His de&s;cription
agrees with mine, and al&s;o with Belon's. The
only differences between the three are in the co|lour
of the horns and hair. The zebu of Belon
was yellow on the belly, brown on the back,
and had black horns. That of Pro&s;per Alpinus
was red, marked with &s;mall &s;pots, with horns of
the ordinary colour. Ours was of a pale yel|low,
almo&s;t black on the back, with horns of
the &s;ame colour as tho&s;e of a common ox. In
the figures of Belon and Pro&s;per Alpinus, the
bunch on the back is not &s;ufficiently marked.
The oppo&s;ite error takes place in the figure
which Mr Edwards<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Nat. Hi&s;t. of Birds, p. 200.</NOTE> has lately given of this
animal, from a drawing communicated to him
by Sir Hans Sloane; for the bunch is too large.
Be&s;ides, the figure is incomplete; for it &s;eems to
have been drawn from a very young animal, who&s;e
horns were only beginning to &s;hoot. It came,
&s;ays Mr Edwards, from the Ea&s;t Indies, where
the&s;e &s;mall oxen are u&s;ed as we do hor&s;es. From
all the&s;e hints, and likewi&s;e from the varieties
in the colour, and the natural mildne&s;s of this
animal, it is apparent, that it belongs to the
bunched race of oxen, and has derived its origin
from a dome&s;tic &s;tate, in which the &s;malle&s;t in|dividuals
<PB N="168" REF="185">
have been cho&s;en for a breed; for, in
general, we find, that the bunched oxen in a
dome&s;tic &s;tate, like our own dome&s;tic kind, are
&s;maller than tho&s;e in a wild &s;tate. The&s;e facts
&s;hall afterwards be fully confirmed by the tes;ti|monies
of travellers.</P>
<P>5. <HI>The bona&s;us of Ari&s;totle is the &s;ame animal
with the bi&s;on of the Latins.</HI> This propo&s;i|tion
cannot be proved, without a critical di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion,
with which I will not fatigue the reader<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Here it is nece&s;&s;ary to compare what Ari&s;totle has &s;aid of the bona&s;us. (<HI>Hi&s;t. anim. lib. 9. cap.</HI> 45.) with what he el&s;e|where remarks, (<HI>lib. de Mirabilibus</HI>) and likewi&s;e the particu|lar pa&s;&s;ages in his <HI>hi&s;t. anim. lib 2. c. 1. &amp;</HI> 16. and al&s;o to read Ge&s;ner's di&s;&s;ertation on this &s;ubject; <HI>Hi&s;t. qua$. p.</HI> 131.</NOTE>.
Ge&s;ner, who was a man of literature as well
as a naturali&s;t, and who thought, as I do, that
the bona&s;us might probably be the bi&s;on, has
examined the notices given of the bona&s;us by
Ari&s;totle with more care than any other per&s;on;
he has, at the &s;ame time, corrected &s;everal er|roneous
expre&s;&s;ions in Theodore Gaza's tran|&s;lation;
which errors, however, have been &s;er|vilely
copied by all the &s;ucceeding naturali&s;ts.
From the&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tances, and by rejecting from
the remarks of Ari&s;totle whatever is ob&s;cure,
contradictory, or fabulous, the following &s;eems
to be the re&s;ult. The bona&s;us is a wild ox of
Poeonia, and is as large, and of the &s;ame figure
with the dome&s;tic ox. But his neck, from the
&s;houlders to the eyes, is covered with long hair,
<PB N="169" REF="186">
which is &s;ofter than the mane of a hor&s;e. He
has the voice of an ox. His horns are &s;hort,
and bended down round the ears. His legs are
covered with long hair, as &s;oft as wool; and his
tail is &s;hort in proportion to his &s;ize, though in
every other re&s;pect it is &s;imilar to that of the
ox. Like the bull, he has the habit of rai&s;ing
the du&s;t with his feet. His &s;kin his hard, and
his fle&s;h tender and good. From the&s;e charac|ters,
which are all that can be collected from
the writings of Ari&s;totle, we &s;ee how nearly
the bona&s;us approaches to the bi&s;on. Every
article, indeed, corre&s;ponds, except the form
of the horns, which, as was formerly remarked,
varies con&s;iderably in animals that belong to
the &s;ame &s;pecies. We have &s;een horns bend|ed
in the &s;ame manner, which were taken from
a bunched ox of Africa; and we &s;hall afterwards
prove, that this bunched ox is nothing but the
bi&s;on. What I now advance may likewi&s;e be
confirmed by the te&s;timonies of antient authors.
Ari&s;totle calls the bona&s;us a Poeonian ox;
and Pau&s;anias<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Pau&s;an. in Beoticis et Phocicis.</NOTE>, &s;peaking of the Poeonian bull,
&s;ays, in two different places, that the&s;e bulls are
bi&s;ons. He likewi&s;e tells us, that the Poeonian
bulls, which he &s;aw at the Roman &s;hews, had
very long hair on the brea&s;t, and about the
jaws. La&s;tly, Julius Cae&s;ar, Pliny, Pau&s;anias,
Solinus, &amp;c. when &s;peaking of wild oxen, men|tion
the aurochs and the bi&s;on, but take no no|tice
of the bona&s;us. We mu&s;t, therefore, &s;up|pose
<PB N="170" REF="187">
that, in the cour&s;e of four or five centu|ries,
the &s;pecies of bona&s;us has been lo&s;t, unle&s;s
we allow that the terms <HI>bona&s;us</HI> and <HI>bi&s;on</HI> de|note
only the &s;ame animal.</P>
<P>6. <HI>The bi&s;on of America might proceed ori|ginally
from the European bi&s;on.</HI> The founda|tion
of this opinion has already been laid in
our di&s;&s;ertation on the animals peculiar to the
two Continents<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See vol. 5. of this work.</NOTE>. It was from the experi|ments
of M. de la Nux that we derived much
information on this &s;ubject. From him we
learn, that the bi&s;ons, or bunched oxen of India
and Africa, produce with the European bulls
and cows, and that the bunch is only an acci|dental
character, which dimini&s;hes in the fir&s;t
generation, and totally di&s;appears in the &s;econd
or third. Since the Indian bi&s;ons are of the
&s;ame &s;pecies with our oxen, and, of cour&s;e,
have the &s;ame origin, is it not natural to extend
this origin to the American bi&s;on? In &s;upport
of this &s;uppo&s;ition, every thing &s;eems to concur.
The bi&s;on appears to be a native of cold and
temperate regions. His name is derived from
the German language. The antients tell us, that
he was found in that part of Germany which
borders upon Scythia<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pauci&s;&s;ima Scythia gignit animalia, inopia fructus, pauca contermina illi Germania, in&s;ignia tamen boum ferorum genera, jubatos bi&s;ontes; <HI>Plin. Hi&s;t. nat. lib. 8. cap.</HI> 15.</NOTE>; and there are &s;till bi|&s;ons in
the northern parts of Germany, in Poland,
<PB N="171" REF="188">
and in Scotland. Hence they might pa&s;s to A|merica,
or come from that country, as they are
animals common to both Continents. The on|ly
difference between the European and Ame|rican
bi&s;ons is, that the latter are &s;maller. But
even this difference is a farther proof that they
belong to the &s;ame &s;pecies; for it was former|ly
remarked, that, in general, both the dome&s;tic
and wild animals, which have &s;pontaneou&s;ly
pa&s;&s;ed, or have been tran&s;ported into America,
have uniformly dimini&s;hed in &s;ize. Be&s;ides,
all the characters, not excepting the bunch and
the long hair on the anterior parts of the body,
are the &s;ame in the American and European bi|&s;ons.
Hence the&s;e animals mu&s;t be regarded
as not only of the &s;ame &s;pecies, but as proceed|ing
from the &s;ame race<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Several per&s;ons of note have reared &s;mall oxen and wild cows, which are found in Carolina, and in other countries as far &s;outh as Pen&s;ylvania.

Their heads are &s;o &s;trong, that they overturn the pali&s;ades of their inclo&s;ures, to come at the cultivated fields, where they do much mi&s;chief; and, as &s;oon as a pa&s;&s;age is opened, they are followed by the whole flock of dome&s;tic cattle. The&s;e two kinds couple together, and have given ri&s;e to an interme|diate kind; <HI>Voyage de Pierre Kalm, p.</HI> 350.</NOTE>.</P>

by accidental varieties only; and, con&s;equently,
it is, as well as the aurochs, of the &s;ame &s;pecies
with the dome&s;tic ox.</HI> The bunch, the length
and quality of the hair, and the figure of the
horns, are the &s;ole characters by which the bi|&s;on
can be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the aurochs. But
we have &s;een the bunched oxen produce with
the common dome&s;tic kind; we likewi&s;e know,
that the length and quality of the hair, in all
animals, depend on the nature of the climate;
and we have remarked, that, in the ox, &s;heep,
and goat, the form of the horns is various and
fluctuating. The&s;e differences, therefore, are
by no means &s;ufficient to con&s;titute two di&s;tinct
&s;pecies: And, &s;ince our dome&s;tic cattle produce
with the bunched Indian oxen, they would like|wi&s;e
undoubtedly produce with the bi&s;on or
bunched ox of Europe. Among the almo&s;t in|numerable
varieties of the&s;e animals in different
<PB N="173" REF="190">
climates, there are two primitive races, both of
which have long continued in a natural &s;tate,
the bi&s;on or bunched ox, and the aurochs, or
ox without a bunch. The&s;e two races have
&s;ub&s;i&s;ted either in a wild or dome&s;tic &s;tate,
and have been diffu&s;ed, or rather tran&s;ported by
men into every climate of the globe. All the dome&s;tic
oxen without bunches have proceeded
originally from the aurochs, and all the bunch|ed
oxen have been derived from the bi&s;on. To
obtain a ju&s;t idea of the&s;e varieties, we &s;hall
give an enumeration of them as they exi&s;t in
different parts of the world.</P>
<P>To begin with the north of Europe, the &s;mall
bulls and cows of Iceland<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">I&s;landi dome&s;tica animalia habent vaccas, &s;ed multae &s;unt mutilae cornibus; <HI>Dithmar Blefken. I&s;land. pag.</HI> 49.</NOTE>, though they belong
to the &s;ame race with our oxen, are deprived of
horns. The magnitude of the&s;e animals depends
more on the abundance and quality of their pa&s;|ture,
than on the nature of the climate. The
Dutch<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">About the month of February, va&s;t numbers of meager cows are brought from Denmark, which the Dutch pea&s;ants turn into their meadows.

<PB N="174" REF="191">
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">In the Ukraine, the pa&s;ture is &s;o excellent, that the cattle are much larger than in any other part of Europe. It requires a man above the middling &s;tature to be able to lay his hand on the middle of an ox's back; <HI>Relat, de la Grande Tartarie, p.</HI> 227.</NOTE>, and are of the &s;ame race with the com|mon
kind. In Switzerland, where the tops of the
the fir&s;t mountains are covered with verdure and
flowers, and are &s;olely de&s;tined for the feeding
of cattle, the oxen are nearly double the &s;ize of
tho&s;e in France, where they are common|ly
fed upon gro&s;s herbage, which is de&s;pi&s;ed
by the hor&s;es. During winter, bad hay and
leaves are the common food of our oxen; and,
in &s;pring, when they &s;tand in need of being re|cruited,
they are excluded from the meadows.
Hence they &s;uffer more in &s;pring than in win|ter;
for they then hardly receive any thing in
the &s;table, but are conducted into the highways,
into fallow grounds, or into the woods, and are
always kept at a di&s;tance from fertile land; &s;o
that they are more fatigued than nouri&s;hed.
La&s;tly, in &s;ummer, they are permitted to go in|to
the meadows, which are then eat up, and
parched with drought. During the whole year,
therefore, the&s;e animals are never &s;ufficiently
nouri&s;hed, nor receive food agreeable to their
nature. This is the &s;ole cau&s;e which renders
them weak, and of a &s;mall &s;ize; for, in Spain,
and in &s;ome di&s;tricts of our provinces, where
the pa&s;ture is good, and re&s;erved for oxen alone,
they are much larger and &s;tronger.</P>

When one of them dies, or becomes un&s;erviceable by age, another is &s;elected from the flock to &s;ucceed him. The choice is made by one of the olde&s;t Kraals, who is &s;uppo&s;ed to di&s;tingui&s;h the animal that will be mo&s;t ea&s;ily in&s;tructed. This noviciate is a&s;&s;ociated with one of the mo&s;t exprienced backeleys, and he is taught to follow his companion either by blows, or by other means. In the night, they are tied together by the horns, and are likewi&s;e kept in the &s;ame &s;ituation during part of the day, till the young ox is completely trained to be a vigilant defender of the flock.

Hence, tho&s;e people may approach their cattle with the utmo&s;t &s;afety; for the backeleys never do them the &s;malle&s;t injury. But, if a &s;tranger, and particularly an Eu|ropean, &s;hould u&s;e the &s;ame freedom, without being ac|companied with a Hottentot, his life would be in the greate&s;t danger. The&s;e backeleys, who pa&s;ture all around, would &s;oon run upon him at full gallop, and, if not protected by the &s;hepherds, by fire-arms, or by &s;uddenly climbing a tree, his de&s;truction is inevitable. In vain would he have re|cour&s;e to &s;ticks or &s;tones: A backeley is not to be intimidated by &s;uch feeble weapons; <HI>Description du Cap de Bonne-e&s;perance, par Kolbe, part. 1. chap. 20. p.</HI> 307.</NOTE>, which they

the &s;ame &s;pecies, which, according to the differ|ences
of climate, of food, and of treatment, have
undergone the various changes above de&s;cribed.

<PB N="189" REF="208">
con&s;titution is equally adapted to the ardours of
the South, and the rigours of the North. It
appears to be very antient in all climates. It is
dome&s;tic in civilized nations, and wild in de&s;ert
countries, or among unpoli&s;hed people. From
its own re&s;ources, it &s;upports it&s;elf in a &s;tate of
nature, and never lo&s;es tho&s;e qualities which
render it &s;erviceable to man. The young wild
calves which are carried off from their mothers
in India and Africa, &s;oon become as gentle as
tho&s;e of the dome&s;tic race. This conformity in
natural di&s;po&s;itions is a &s;till farther proof of the
identity of the &s;pecies. Mildne&s;s of character in
the&s;e animals indicates a phy&s;ical flexibility in
the form of their bodies; for in every &s;pecies,
who&s;e di&s;po&s;itions are gentle, and who have been
&s;ubjected to a dome&s;tic &s;tate, there are more va|rieties
than in tho&s;e who, from an inflexibility
of temper, have remained &s;avage.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="209">
If it be a&s;ked, whether the aurochs or the
bi&s;on be the primitive race of oxen, a &s;atisfactory
an&s;wer may be obtained by drawing conclu&s;ions
from the facts already related. The bunch of
the bi&s;on, as formerly remarked, is only an ac|cidental
character, which is effaced by the com|mixture
of the two races. The aurochs, or ox
without a bunch, is, therefore, the mo&s;t power|ful
and predominant race. Were it otherwi&s;e,
the bunch, in&s;tead of di&s;appearing, would extend,
and &s;ub&s;i&s;t in all the individuals proceeding from
a mixture of the two races. Be&s;ides, this bunch
of the bi&s;on, like that of the camel, is not &s;o
much a production of nature, as an effect of la|bour,
and a badge of &s;lavery. In all ages, and
in every country, the oxen have been obliged to
carry burdens. Their backs, by con&s;tant and
often exce&s;&s;ive loads, have been deformed; and
this deformity was afterwards tran&s;mitted by ge|neration.
There remained no oxen without this
deformity, except in tho&s;e countries where
they were not employed in carrying burdens.
Throughout all Africa and the Ea&s;t, the oxen
are bunched; becau&s;e, at all periods, they have
carried loads on their &s;houlders. In Europe,
where they are only employed in the draught,
they have not undergone this deformed change,
which is probably occa&s;ioned, in the fir&s;t place,
by the compre&s;&s;ion of the loads, and, in the &s;e|cond,
by a redundance of nouri&s;hment; for it
di&s;appears when the animal is meager and ill
<PB N="191" REF="210">
fed. Dome&s;tic oxen with bunches might e&s;cape,
or be abandoned in the woods, where their po|&s;terity
would inherit the &s;ame deformity, which,
in&s;tead of di&s;appearing, would augment by the
abundance of food peculiar to all uncultivated
countries; &s;o that this &s;econdary race would
&s;pread over all the de&s;ert lands of the North and
South, and pa&s;s, like the other animals which
can &s;upport the rigours of cold, into the New
Continent. The identity of the &s;pecies of the
bi&s;on and aurochs is &s;till farther confirmed from
this circum&s;tance, that the bi&s;ons of North Ame|rica
have &s;o &s;trong an odour of mu&s;k, that they
have been called <HI>mu&s;k oxen</HI> by mo&s;t travellers<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Fifteen leagues from the river Danoi&s;e, is the river call|ed <HI>Sea-wolf,</HI> both in the neighbourhood of Hud&s;on's bay.

<P>Of all the names, therefore, prefixed to this
article, which, both by antient and modern na|turali&s;ts,
are repre&s;ented as &s;o many di&s;tinct &s;pe|cies,
there remain only the buffalo and the ox.
The&s;e two animals, though very &s;imilar, both
dome&s;tic, often living under the &s;ame roof, and
fed in the &s;ame pa&s;tures, though at liberty to in|termix,
and frequently &s;timulated to it by their
keepers, have uniformly refu&s;ed to unite. They
neither copulate nor produce together. Their
natures are more remote from each other than
that of the a&s;s and hor&s;e: They even &s;eem to
have a mutual antipathy; for we are a&s;&s;ured,
that cows will not &s;uckle young buffaloes, and
that female buffaloes refu&s;e to &s;uckle calves. The
di&s;po&s;ition of the buffalo is more ob&s;tinate and
untractable than that of the ox. He is le&s;s obe|dient,
more violent, and &s;ubject to humours more
frequent and more impetuous. All his habits
are gro&s;s and brutal. Next to the hog, he is the
dirtie&s;t of dome&s;tic animals; for nothing is more
difficult than to dre&s;s and keep him clean. His
figure is gro&s;s and forbidding. His a&s;pect is
wild and &s;tupid. He &s;tretches out his neck in
an aukward, ignoble manner, and carries his
head &s;o ungracefully, that it generally hangs
down toward the ground. He bellows hideou&s;|ly,
and with a &s;tronger and deeper tone than
that of the bull. He has meager limbs, a naked
<PB N="193" REF="212">
tail, a dark countenance, and a &s;kin as black as
his hair. He differs chiefly from the ox by this
black colour of his &s;kin: It appears under the
hair, which is not clo&s;e. His body is thicker and
&s;horter than that of the ox, his legs longer, his
head proportionally &s;maller, his horns le&s;s round,
being black and compre&s;&s;ed; and he has a tuft
of curled hair on his front. His &s;kin is al&s;o
thicker and harder than that of the ox. His
fle&s;h is black and hard, and has not only a bad
ta&s;te, but a mo&s;t di&s;agreeable odour<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In travelling from Rome to Naples, we are &s;ometimes regaled with crows and buffaloes, and are happy to find them.

of it<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In entering Per&s;ia, by the way of Armenia, the fir&s;t place worthy of notice is called the <HI>Three Churches,</HI> at the di&s;tance of three leagues from Erivan. In this country, there are va&s;t numbers of buffaloes, which &s;erve the inhabitants for plough|ing their lands. The females yield a great quantity of milk, of which butter and chee&s;e are made. Some females give daily twenty-two pints of milk; <HI>Voyage de Tavernier, liv. 1. tom. 1. p.</HI> 41.&mdash;The female buffaloes go with young twelve months, and often give twenty-two pints of milk a-day, of which &s;o great quantities of butter are made, that, in &s;ome of the villages on the Tigris, we &s;aw from twenty to twenty-five barks loaded with butter, to be &s;old along both &s;ides of the Per&s;ic Gulf; <HI>Id. ib.</HI></NOTE>. In warm countries, mo&s;t chee&s;es are
made of the buffalo's milk. The fle&s;h of young
buffaloes, though fed with milk, is not good.
The &s;kin is of more value than the re&s;t of
<PB N="194" REF="213">
the animal, the tongue of which is alone good
for eating. The &s;kin is &s;olid, pretty flexible,
and almo&s;t impenetrable. As the&s;e animals are
larger and &s;tronger than oxen, they are employ|ed
with advantage in different kinds of labour.
They are made to draw, and not to carry bur|dens.
They are directed and re&s;trained by means
of a ring pa&s;&s;ed through their no&s;e. Two buf|faloes
yoked, or rather chained, to a chariot,
draw as much as four &s;trong hor&s;es. As they
carry their neck and head low, the whole weight
of their body is employed in drawing; and their
ma&s;s much &s;urpa&s;&s;es that of a labouring hor&s;e.</P>
<P>The height and thickne&s;s of the buffalo are
&s;ufficient indications that he originated from
warm climates. The large&s;t quadrupeds are
produced in the Torrid Zone of the Old Conti|nent;
and the buffalo, in the order of magnitude,
&s;hould be ranked next to the elephant, the rhi|noceros,
and the hippopotamus. The camelo|pard
and the camel are taller, but thinner; and
the whole are equally natives of the &s;outhern
regions of A&s;ia and Africa. Buffaloes, however,
live and produce in Italy, in France, and in o|ther
temperate countries. Tho&s;e kept in the
royal menagerie have produced twice or thrice.
The female brings forth but one at a birth, and
goes with young about twelve months; which
is a &s;till farther proof of the difference of this
&s;pecies from that of the cow, who&s;e time of
ge&s;tation is only nine months. It appears, like|wi&s;e,
<PB N="195" REF="214">

The Italian buffaloes have al&s;o more hair than
tho&s;e of Egypt, and the Egyptian than tho&s;e
of India<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">At Malabar, the buffalo is larger than the ox. He is &s;haped nearly in the &s;ame manner. His head is longer and flatter.

He walks &s;lowly, and carries heavy burdens. Like the cows, they go in flocks; and their milk produces butter and chee&s;e. Their fle&s;h is good, though le&s;s delicate than that of the ox. They are excellent &s;wimmers, and traver&s;e the mo&s;t rapid rivers. We have &s;een them tamed.

rivers and exten&s;ive meadows. The&s;e wild
buffaloes go in flocks<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">There are &s;uch numbers of wild buffaloes in the Philip|pine i&s;les, that a good hunter, with a hor&s;e and a &s;pear, may kill thirty of them in a day. The Spaniards kill the buffalo for his &s;kin, and the Indians for his fle&s;h; <HI>Voyage de Gemelli Careri, tom. 5. p.</HI> 162.</NOTE>, and make great havock
in the cultivated fields. But they never attack
men, unle&s;s when they are wounded. They
are then extremely dangerous<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">We are told by the Negroes, that, when they &s;hoot at the buffaloes, without wounding them mortally, they dart with fury on the hunters, and trample them to death.....The Negroes watch where the buffaloes a&s;&s;emble in the evening, climb a large tree, from which they fire upon them, and de|&s;cend not till the animals are dead; <HI>Voyage de Bo&s;man, p.</HI> 437.</NOTE>; for they run
&s;traight upon the enemy, overturn him, and
trample him under their feet. They are, how|ever,
afraid at the &s;ight of fire<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">At the Cape of Good Hope, the buffaloes are larger than tho&s;e of Europe. ln&s;tead of being black, like the latter, they are of a dark red colour. Upon the front, there is a rude tuft of curled hair. Their whole body is well propor|tioned; and they advance their head very much forward. Their horns are very &s;hort, and hang down on the &s;ide of their neck; the tips bend inward, and nearly join. Their &s;kin is &s;o hard and firm, that it is difficult to kill them with-out a good firelock. Their fle&s;h is neither &s;o fat nor &s;o tender as that of ordinary oxen. The buffalo, at the Cape, turns furious at the &s;ight of a red gar-ment, or upon hearing a gun di&s;charged near him. On the&s;e occa&s;ions, he cries in a hide|ous manner, &s;trikes with his feet, turns up the earth, and runs with fury again&s;t the man who has &s;hot, or wears a red gar|ment. Neither fire nor water can &s;top his cour&s;e. Nothing but a high wall, or &s;ome &s;imilar ob&s;tacle, is capable of re|&s;training him; <HI>De&s;cript. de Bonne-e&s;perance, par Kolbe, tom. 3. chap. 11. p.</HI> 25.</NOTE>, and they ab|hor

a red colour. We are a&s;&s;ured by Aldrovan|dus,
and &s;everal other naturali&s;ts and travellers,
that no per&s;on dare clothe him&s;elf in red, in
countries frequented by the buffalo. I know
not whether this aver&s;ion to fire and a red colour
be general among the buffaloes; for it is only
&s;ome of our oxen which are enraged at the
&s;ight of red clothes.</P>
<P>The buffalo, like all the large animals of warm
climates, is fond of wallowing, and even of re|maining
in the water. He &s;wims well, and
boldly cro&s;&s;es the mo&s;t rapid rivers. As his legs
are longer than tho&s;e of the ox, he runs more
&s;wiftly. The Negroes of Guiney, and the In|dians
of Malabar, where the buffaloes are very
numerous, are fond of hunting them. They
never attack the&s;e animals openly, but watch
for them on the tops of trees, or lie hid in the
thickets through which the buffaloes cannot pa&s;s
on account of their horns. The&s;e people e&s;teem
the fle&s;h of the buffalo, and draw great profits
from his &s;kin and horns, which are harder and
better than tho&s;e of the ox.</P>
<P>The animal called <HI>empaca&s;&s;a</HI> or <HI>paca&s;&s;a</HI> at Con|go, though very imperfectly de&s;cribed by travel|lers,
<PB N="198" REF="217">
appears to me to be the buffalo; and the a|nimal
mentioned under the name of <HI>empabunga</HI>
or <HI>impalunca,</HI> in the &s;ame country, is, perhaps,
the bubalus, who&s;e hi&s;tory &s;hall be given along
with that of the gazelles or antelopes.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>The ox and bi&s;on are two di&s;tinct races of the
&s;ame &s;pecies. Though the bi&s;on uniformly dif|fers
from the ox by the bunch on his back, and
the length of his hair, he &s;ucceeds very well in
the I&s;le of France: His fle&s;h is much better than
that of the European oxen; and, after &s;ome ge|nerations,
his bunch vani&s;hes entirely. His hair
is &s;moother, his limbs are more &s;lender, and his
horns longer than tho&s;e of the common ox. I
&s;aw, &s;ays M. de Querho&euml;nt, bi&s;ons brought from
Madaga&s;car, which were of an a&s;toni&s;hing
&s;ize<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Note communicated by M. le Vicomte de Querho&euml;nt.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The bi&s;on, of which we here give a figure,
and which we &s;aw alive, was taken, when young,
in the fore&s;ts of the temperate parts of North
America. It was brought to Holland, and
purcha&s;ed by a Swede, who tran&s;ported it from
town to town in a large cage, where it was firm|ly
<PB N="199" REF="218">
fixed by the head with four ropes. The e|normous
mane which &s;urrounds its head is not
hair, but a flowing wool, divided into locks, like
an old fleece. This wool is very fine, as well as
that which covers the bunch, and the anterior
part of the body. The parts which appear naked
in the engraving, are only &s;o at a certain time
of the year, which is rather in &s;ummer than in
winter; for, in the month of January, all parts
of the body were almo&s;t equally covered with
a fine, clo&s;e, frizzled wool, under which the
&s;kin was of a &s;ooty colour; but, on the bunch,
and all the other parts which are covered with
longer wool, the &s;kin is tawny. This bunch,
which con&s;i&s;ts entirely of fle&s;h, varies according
to the plight of the animal. To us he appeared
to differ from the European only by the bunch
and the wool. Though under much re&s;traint,
he was not ferocious, but allowed his keepers to
touch and care&s;s him.</P>
<P>It would appear, that there were formerly bi|&s;ons
in the north of Europe. Ge&s;ner even a&s;|&s;erts,
that, in his time, they exi&s;ted in Scotland.
Having inquired into this fact, I was informed,
by letters both from Scotland and England, that
no remembrance or ve&s;tige of them could be
traced in that country. Mr Bell, in his travels
from Ru&s;&s;ia to China, mentions two &s;pecies of
oxen which he &s;aw in the northern parts of A&s;ia;
one of which was the aurochs, or wild ox, and is
<PB N="200" REF="219">
the &s;ame race with our oxen; and the other,
which we have denominated, after Gmelin, the
<HI>Tartarian,</HI> or <HI>Grunting Cow,</HI> appeared to be the
&s;ame &s;pecies with the bi&s;on. After comparing
this grunting cow with the bi&s;on, I found an
exact coincidence in all the characters, except the
grunting in&s;tead of bellowing. But I appre|hend,
that this grunting is not con&s;tant and ge|neral,
but contingent and particular, &s;imilar to
the deep interrupted voice of our bulls, which
is never fully exhibited but in the &s;ea&s;on of love.
Be&s;ides, I was informed, that the voice of the
bi&s;on, who&s;e figure I have repre&s;ented, was never
heard, and that, though con&s;iderably hurt, it did
not complain, which induced its ma&s;ter to think
that it was mute: And it is probable, that its voice
would be developed by grunting or interrupted
&s;ounds, when, in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of freedom and
in pre&s;ence of a female, the animal's &s;pirits were
excited by love.</P>
<P>It is &s;ingular, that the bi&s;ons, or bunched oxen,
who&s;e race appears to be extended, in the Old
Continent, from Madaga&s;car and the point of
Africa, and from the extremity of the Ea&s;t In|dies
as far as Siberia, and that, in the new Con|tinent,
though they are found from the country
of the Ilionois to Loui&s;iana, and even Mexico,
they &s;hould never have pa&s;&s;ed the I&s;thmus of Pa|nama;
for there are no bi&s;ons in any part of
South America, though the climate is perfectly
<PB N="201" REF="220">
agreeable to their nature, and the European oxen
have multiplied there as well as in any other
part of the globe.</P>
<P>At Madaga&s;car, the be&s;t kind of bulls and cows
were brought thither from Africa, and have a
bunch on their backs. The cows yield &s;o little
milk, that a &s;ingle Dutch cow would give &s;ix
times as much. In this i&s;land, there are wild
bi&s;ons which wander in the fore&s;ts. The fle&s;h
of the&s;e bi&s;ons is not equal to that of our oxen<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Fran&ccedil;ois le Guat, tom. 2. p. 71.</NOTE>. In the &s;outhern parts of A&s;ia, we likewi&s;e find wild oxen. The natives of Agra hunt the&s;e animals on the mountain of Nerwer, which is &s;urrounded with wood. This mountain is &s;i|tuated on the road from Surat to Golconda. The&s;e wild cattle are generally beautiful, and &s;ell very dear<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Thevenot, tom. 3. p. 113.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The zebu &s;eems to be a miniature of the bi|&s;on,
who&s;e race, as well as that of the ox, has
undergone great variations, e&s;pecially in &s;ize.
The zebu, though an original native of very
warm regions, is capable of exi&s;ting and multi|plying
in temperate climates. &startq;I &s;aw,&endq; &s;ays Mr
Colin&s;on, &startq;a great number of the&s;e animals in
the Duke of Richmond's, and al&s;o in the Duke
of Portland's parks, where they every year
bring forth calves, which are extremely beau|tiful.
The fathers and mothers were brought
<PB N="202" REF="221">
from the Ea&s;t Indies. The bunch on the
&s;houlder is twice as large in the male as in the
female, who&s;e &s;tature exceeds that of the male.
The young zebu &s;ucks its mother like other
calves; but, in our climate, the milk of the
mother &s;oon dries up, and the &s;uckling of the
young is completed by the milk of another
female. The Duke of Richmond ordered one
of the&s;e animals to be &s;lain; but its fle&s;h was
not &s;o good as that of the ox<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Letter from the late Mr. Colin&s;on to M. de Buffon, dated at London, December 30. 1764.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>Among the oxen without bunches, there are
al&s;o &s;mall individuals, which, like the zebu, may
con&s;titute a particular race. Gemelli Careri, in
his journey from I&s;pahan to Schiras, &s;aw two
&s;mall cows, which the Ba&s;haw of the province
had &s;ent to the King, and which exceeded not
the &s;ize of calves. Though fed &s;olely on &s;traw,
they were very fat<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Gemelli Careri, tom. 2, p. 338.</NOTE>. In general, it appears, that
the zebus, or &s;mall bi&s;ons, as well as our little
oxen, are more fle&s;hy and fatter than the bi&s;ons
and oxen of the common &s;ize.</P>
<P>With regard to the buffaloes, we have little to
add. It &s;hall only be remarked, that, though
they cannot u&s;e their horns, they are made to
fight lions and tigers in the Mogul's country.
The&s;e animals are very numerous in all warm
climates, e&s;pecially in mar&s;hy countries, and in
<PB N="203" REF="222">
the neighbourhood of rivers. Water, and a
moi&s;t &s;oil, &s;eem to be &s;till more nece&s;&s;ary to them
than the warmth of the climate<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">I formerly remarked, that the buffaloes might &s;ucceed in France. Attempts have lately been made to propagate them in Brandenbourg, near Berlin; <HI>Gazette de France, June</HI> 9. 1775.</NOTE>. It is for this
rea&s;on that none of them are found in Arabia,
where almo&s;t the whole country is dry. The
wild buffaloes are hunted, but with much cau|tion;
for they are exceedingly dangerous, and,
when wounded, run again&s;t men with great
fury. As to the dome&s;tic buffaloes, Niebuhr re|marks,
that, in &s;ome places, as at Ba&s;ra, it is the
practice, when milking the female, to thru&s;t the
hand, as far as the elbow, into the vagina, be|cau&s;e
this operation makes her yield a greater
quantity of milk<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">De&s;cript. de l'Arabie, par M. Niebuhr, p. 145.</NOTE>. This fact appears not to be
probable; but the female buffalo, like &s;ome of
our cows, may forcibly retain her milk; and this
gentle kind of titillation may relax the contrac|tion
of her teats.</P>
<P>At the Cape of Good Hope, the body of the
buffalo is of the &s;ame &s;ize with our ox; but he
has &s;horter legs, and a larger head. He is a
very formidable animal. He frequents the bor|ders
of the woods, and, as his &s;ight is not good,
he remains there with his head placed near the
ground, in order the better to di&s;tingui&s;h objects
among the roots of the trees. When he per|ceives
<PB N="204" REF="223">
any di&s;agreeable object near him, he
darts &s;uddenly upon it, making, at the &s;ame
time, a mo&s;t hideous bellowing; and it is very
difficult, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, to e&s;cape his fury.
He is not &s;o much to be dreaded in the open
fields. His hair is red, and black in &s;ome places.
They appear often in numerous flocks<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Note communicated by the Vicomte de Querho&euml;nt to M. de Buffon.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>THE weake&s;t &s;pecies of u&s;eful animals were

the ox, or the camel. They were likewi&s;e more
ea&s;ily tran&s;ported from one climate to another.
From this &s;ource, all the varieties among the&s;e
&s;pecies, as well as the difficulty of di&s;tingui&s;hing
the genuine &s;tock of each, have proceeded. We
formerly proved, that our dome&s;tic &s;heep, in
their pre&s;ent condition, could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t with|out
the &s;upport of man<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See above, article <HI>Sheep,</HI> vol. III.</NOTE>; from which it is ap|parent,
that Nature never produced them as
they exi&s;t at pre&s;ent, but that they have dege|nerated
under our care. We mu&s;t, therefore,
&s;earch among the wild animals for tho&s;e which
make the neare&s;t approach to them. We mu&s;t
compare them with the dome&s;tic &s;heep of foreign
countries, examine the different cau&s;es which
<PB N="207" REF="230">
might introduce changes into the &s;pecies, or
make it degenerate, and endeavour, as in the

all the&s;e pretended &s;pecies, to one primitive
race.</P>

that we mu&s;t pronounce them to
belong to the &s;ame race. Of all the dome&s;tic

&s;tate of nature. It is larger, &s;tronger, nimbler,
and, con&s;equently, more capable of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting as
a wild animal. But, as it is only found in very
warm climates, and cannot endure cold, and
as, even in its native climate, it &s;ub&s;i&s;ts not in a
wild &s;tate, but is dome&s;tic, and requires the aid
of man, it cannot be regarded as the primitive
&s;tock from which all other &s;heep have derived
their origin.</P>
<P>In con&s;idering dome&s;tic &s;heep, therefore, relative
to the order of climate, we have, 1. The northern
&s;heep with &s;everal horns, and who&s;e wool is
extremely coar&s;e. The &s;heep of Iceland, Goth|land,
Mu&s;covy<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Twenty Sile&s;ian &s;hepherds arrived at Peter&s;burg, and were afterwards &s;ent to Cazan to &s;hear the &s;heep, and to teach the Mu&s;covites the mode of preparing wool.&mdash;But this did not &s;ucceed; and the chief cau&s;e of its failure was &s;aid to be owing to the coar&s;ene&s;s of the wool, the &s;heep and goats having always intermixed and produced together; <HI>Nouv.

le&s;s &s;hort and coar&s;e, in proportion to the heat of
the climate. All the&s;e &s;heep are only varieties
of the &s;ame &s;pecies, and would unque&s;tionably
produce with each other; &s;ince we know from
experience that the he-goat, who&s;e &s;pecies is
more remote, produces with our ewes. But,
though the&s;e five or &s;ix races of dome&s;tic &s;heep
are all varieties of the &s;ame &s;pecies, entirely
occa&s;ioned by difference of climate, food, and
management; yet none of them appears to be
the primitive &s;tock or &s;ource of all the re&s;t.
None of them is &s;ufficiently &s;trong or nimble to
re&s;i&s;t the carnivorous animals, or to e&s;cape from
them by flight. All of them equally require care
and protection. Hence the whole &s;hould be re|garded
as degenerated races, formed by the hand
of man, and multiplied for his u&s;e. While he
nouri&s;hed, cultivated, and increa&s;ed the&s;e dome|&s;tic
races, he would neglect, injure, and de&s;troy
the wild race, which, being &s;trong and le&s;s trac|table,
would, of cour&s;e, be more incommodious
and le&s;s u&s;eful to him. The individuals of this
race, therefore, would be &s;mall, and limited to &s;uch
de&s;ert or thinly inhabited places as could afford
them &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Now, in the mountains of
Greece, in the i&s;land of Cyprus, Sardinia, and
Cor&s;ica, and in the de&s;erts of Tartary, we find
<PB N="216" REF="239">
the animal called <HI>mouflon,</HI> which &s;eems to be the
primitive &s;tock of all the different varieties of
&s;heep. It lives in a &s;tate of nature, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ts
and multiplies without the aid of man. It re|&s;embles,
more than any other wild animal, all
the dome&s;tic kinds, and it is &s;tronger, &s;wifter,
and more vivacious than any of them. It has
the head, front, eyes, and face of the ram. It
likewi&s;e re&s;embles him in the figure of the horns,
and in the whole habit of the body. In fine,
it produces with the dome&s;tic &s;heep<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">E&s;t et in Hi&s;pania, &s;ed maxime Cor&s;ica, non maxime ab|&s;imile pecori (&s;cilicet ovili) genus mu&s;monum, caprino villo, quam pecoris velleri propius: Quorum e genere et ovibus natos pri&s;ci umbros vocarunt; <HI>Plin. Hi&s;t. nat. lib. 8. cap.</HI> 49. From this pa&s;&s;age we learn, that the mouflon has at all times produced with the &s;heep. The antients called all the mongrel animals of this race, <HI>umbri, imbri,</HI> or <HI>ibri.</HI></NOTE>, which a|lone
is &s;ufficient to prove that it belongs to the
&s;ame &s;pecies, and is the primitive &s;tock from
which all the other varieties have originated.
The only difference between the mouflon and
our &s;heep is, that the former is covered with
hair in&s;tead of wool. Now, we have already
&s;een, that, in dome&s;tic &s;heep, wool is not an e&s;|&s;ential
character, but only a production of tem|perate
climates; &s;ince, in warm countries, the&s;e
&s;ame &s;heep lo&s;e their wool, and are covered with
hair; and, in very cold regions, their wool is as
coar&s;e as hair. Hence it is by no means &s;ur|pri&s;ing,
that the primitive wild &s;heep, which
mu&s;t have been expo&s;ed to heat and cold, and
<PB N="217" REF="240">
mu&s;t have multiplied without &s;helter in the
woods and de&s;erts, &s;hould not be covered with
wool, which it would &s;oon lo&s;e among the thickets,
and its nature would be changed by the conti|nual
action of the air and intemperance of the
&s;ea&s;ons. Be&s;ides, when the he-goat copulates
with the dome&s;tic ewe, the produce is a kind of
mouflon; for the lamb is covered with hair, and
is not an unfertile mule, but a mongrel, which
ri&s;es up toward the primitive &s;pecies, and &s;eems
to indicate that the goat and our dome&s;tic &s;heep
have &s;omething common in their origin: And,
as we know from experience, that the he-goat
ea&s;ily produces with the ewe, but that the ram
is incapable of impregnating the &s;he-goat, it is
evident, that, among the&s;e animals, while in a do|me&s;tic
&s;tate, the goat, is the predominant &s;pecies.
Thus our &s;heep is a &s;pecies much more degenerated
than that of the goat; and it is extremely probable,
that, if the &s;he-goat were &s;erved with a mouflon,
in&s;tead of a dome&s;tic ram, &s;he would produce
kids which would approach to the &s;pecies of
the goat, as the lambs produced by the he-goat
and ewe ri&s;e toward the original &s;pecies of the
ram.</P>
<P>I am aware of objections to this doctrine from
tho&s;e &s;y&s;tematic naturali&s;ts, who found all their
knowledge of natural hi&s;tory upon &s;ome particular
characters; and, therefore, &s;hall endeavour to pre|vent
them. The fir&s;t character, they will &s;ay, of
the ram, is to carry wool, and the fir&s;t character of
<PB N="218" REF="241">
the goat is to be covered with hair. The &s;econd
character of the ram is to have horns bended in
a circular form, and turned backward, and that
of the he-goat is to have them &s;traight and e|rect.
The&s;e, they will affirm, are the e&s;&s;ential
and infallible marks by which &s;heep and goats
will always be di&s;tingui&s;hed; for they mu&s;t ac|knowledge,
that every other article is common
to both. None of them have cutting teeth in the
upper jaw; but each of them has eight in the
under jaw. In both, the canine teeth are wanting;
their hoofs are equally divided, and their horns
are &s;imple and permanent. Both have their paps
&s;ituated in the region of the belly; and both
feed upon herbage. Their internal &s;tructure is
&s;till more &s;imilar; for it appears to be the very
&s;ame. The number and form of their &s;tomachs,
the &s;tructure and di&s;po&s;ition of their inte&s;tines,
the &s;ub&s;tance of the fle&s;h, the qualities of the fat
and &s;eminal liquor, the times of ge&s;tation and
growth, and the duration of their lives, are ex|actly
the &s;ame. There remain, therefore, only the
wool and the horns by which the&s;e two &s;pecies
can be di&s;tingui&s;hed. But, it has already been
&s;hown, from facts, that wool is not &s;o much a
natural &s;ub&s;tance, as a production of climate,
aided by the care of man. The &s;heep of warm
and of cold countries, and wild &s;heep, have no
wool. Be&s;ides, in very mild climates, the goats
may be &s;aid to have wool in&s;tead of hair;
for that of the Angora goat is finer than the
<PB N="219" REF="242">
wool of our wedders. This character, there|fore,
is not e&s;&s;ential, but purely accidental, and
even equivocal; for it may equally belong to
the&s;e two &s;pecies, or be wanting altogether, ac|cording
to the differences of the climates. That
of the horns appears to be &s;till le&s;s certain; for
they vary in number, &s;ize, figure, and direction.
In our dome&s;tic &s;heep, the rams have generally
horns, and the ewes have none. I have &s;een
&s;heep not only with two, but with four horns.
Tho&s;e of the North and of Iceland have &s;ometimes
eight. In warm countries, the rams have only
two &s;hort horns, and often want them, like the
ewes. In &s;ome, the horns are &s;mooth and round;
in others, they are flat and chamfered. The
points, in&s;tead of being bended backward, are
&s;ometimes turned outward, forward, &amp;c. This
character, therefore, is not more con&s;tant than
the former; and, con&s;equently, it is not &s;ufficient
to con&s;titute different &s;pecies<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Linnaeus, with great propriety, in&s;tead of &s;ix &s;pecies, has made &s;ix varieties only of dome&s;tic &s;heep. 1. <HI>Ovis ru&s;tica cornuta. 2.

without any regard to genus, but, in the do|me&s;tic
animals, on the contrary, it was nece&s;&s;ary
not only to adopt, but to increa&s;e the number
of genera; becau&s;e in Nature there exi&s;t only in|dividuals,
and &s;ucce&s;&s;ions of individuals, that is,
&s;pecies. Men have had no influence on inde|pendent
animals; but they have greatly altered
and modified the dome&s;tic kinds. We have,
therefore, e&s;tabli&s;hed phy&s;ical and real genera,
<PB N="221" REF="244">
very different from tho&s;e metaphy&s;ical and arbi|trary
ones, which have no exi&s;tence but in idea.
The&s;e phy&s;ical genera are, in reality, compo&s;ed
of all the &s;pecies, which, by our management,
have been greatly variegated and changed; and,
as all tho&s;e &s;pecies, &s;o differently modified by the
hand of man, have but one common origin in
Nature, the whole genus ought to con&s;titute but
a &s;ingle &s;pecies. In writing, for example, the
hi&s;tory of tigers, we have admitted as many &s;pe|cies
as are really found in different parts of the
earth; becau&s;e we are certain that man has ne|ver
introduced any changes among the&s;e untrac|table
and ferocious animals, who &s;ub&s;i&s;t at pre|&s;ent
in the &s;ame manner as they were originally
produced by Nature. The &s;ame remark applies
to all free and independent animals. But, in
compo&s;ing the hi&s;tory of oxen and &s;heep, we
have reduced all the varieties of the oxen to one
ox, and all the varieties of the &s;heep to one &s;heep;
becau&s;e it is equally certain that man, and not
Nature, has produced the different kinds
which we have enumerated. Every thing concurs in
&s;upporting this idea, which, though clear in it|&s;elf,
may not, perhaps, be &s;ufficiently under&s;tood.
That all the oxen produce together, we are a&s;|&s;ured
by the experiments of M. de la Nux, Ment|zelius,
and Kalm: That all the &s;heep produce
with one another, with the mouflon, and even
with the goat, I know from my own experience.
All the varieties of oxen, therefore, form but one

&s;pecies; and all the &s;heep, however numerous
their varieties, con&s;titute only another &s;pecies.</P>
<P>I am obliged, by the importance of the &s;ub|ject,
to repeat, that Nature is not to be judged
of by particular minute characters, and that by
the&s;e the differences of &s;pecies are not to be de|termined;
that methodical di&s;tributions, in&s;tead
of throwing light on the hi&s;tory of animals, ren|der
it &s;till more ob&s;cure, by a fruitle&s;s multipli|cation
of denominations, and of &s;pecies; by form|ing
arbitrary genera, which Nature never knew;
by confounding real beings with creatures of i|magination;
by giving fal&s;e ideas of the e&s;&s;ential
characteri&s;tics of &s;pecies; and by mixing or &s;e|parating
them in an arbitrary manner, without
&s;kill, and often without having examined or even
&s;een the individuals. It is for this rea&s;on that
our Nomenclators perpetually deceive them&s;elves,
and publi&s;h nearly as many errors as lines. Of
this we have already given &s;o many examples,
that nothing but the blinde&s;t and mo&s;t ob&s;tinate
prejudice can po&s;&s;ibly re&s;i&s;t the evidence they af|ford.
On this &s;ubject M. Gmelin talks very
&s;en&s;ibly, when treating of the animal under con|&s;ideration<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>&startq;The <HI>argali,</HI> or <HI>&s;tepnie-barani,</HI> which occupy,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;the &s;outhern mountains of Siberia, from the river Irtis, as far as Kamt&s;chatka, are extremely vivacious animals; and this vivacity &s;eems to exclude them from the cla&s;s of &s;heep, and to rank them with that of the &s;tags. I &s;hall here give a &s;hort de&s;cription of them, from which it will appear, that neither &s;prightline&s;s, nor inactivi|ty, neither the wool nor hair with which an animal is cover|ed, neither crooked nor &s;traight horns, neither permanent horns, nor tho&s;e which fall off annually, are marks &s;ufficient|ly characteri&s;tic to di&s;tingui&s;h cla&s;&s;es. Nature loves variety; and I am per&s;uaded, that, if we knew better how to manage our &s;en&s;es, they would often lead us to more e&s;&s;ential charac|ters, with regard to the differences of animals, than we gene|rally derive from rea&s;on, which &s;eldom apprehends tho&s;e marks but in a &s;uperficial manner. In this animal, the ex|ternal form of the head, neck, and tail, corre&s;ponds with that of the &s;tag. His vivacity al&s;o, as formerly remarked, is &s;o great, that he &s;eems to be &s;till more wild than the &s;tag. The individual I &s;aw, though reputed to be only three years old, ten men dur&s;t not attack. The large&s;t of this &s;pecies are a|bout the &s;ize of a fallow deer. The one I examined mea|&s;ured, from the ground to the top of the head, a Ru&s;&s;ian ell and a half in height. His length, from the root of the horns, was an ell and three quarters. The horns ri&s;e above and very near the eyes, and ju&s;t before the ears. They fir&s;t bend backward and then forward in a circular form. The tips turn upward and outward. The horns, from the root to the middle, are furrowed, but afterward become &s;omewhat &s;moother. It is probably from the figure of the horns that the Ru&s;&s;ians have called this animal the <HI>wild &s;heep.</HI> If we can tru&s;t the natives of the&s;e provinces, his whole &s;trength lies in his horns. They &s;ay that the rams of this &s;pecies fight by &s;triking each other with their horns; and, when any of them are knocked off, the aperture at the ba&s;e is &s;o large, that the young foxes frequently take &s;helter in the cavity. It is not difficult to e&s;timate the force nece&s;&s;ary to break off one of the&s;e horns, &s;ince they, as long as the animal lives, continue to augment both in thickne&s;s and length; and the part of the head al&s;o from which they &s;pring, becomes always harder. It is &s;aid that a well grown horn, comprehending the curvatures, mea&s;ures two ells in length; that it weighs between thirty and forty Ru&s;&s;ian pounds; and that, at the ba&s;e, it is &s;even or eight inches in diameter. The horns of the one I &s;aw were of a whiti&s;h yellow colour; but they turn browner and black|er as the animal advances in years. He carries his ears, which are pointed and tolerably large, very erect. The hoofs are divided, and the fore legs are three quarters of an ell long, and the hind legs &s;till longer. When the animal &s;tands erect on a plain, his fore legs are always fully extended and &s;traight, and tho&s;e behind are crooked; and this curvature &s;eems to dimini&s;h in proportion to the unequality of the ground over which he pa&s;&s;es. On the neck there are &s;ome pendulous folds. The colour of the body is grayi&s;h mixed with brown. Along the back, there is a yellowi&s;h or rather reddi&s;h line; and the &s;ame colour appears behind, on the in&s;ide of the legs, and on the belly, where it is a little paler. This colour continues from the beginning of Augu&s;t till the &s;pring, at the approach of which the&s;e animals ca&s;t their hair, and become every where more red. They ca&s;t their hair a &s;econd time about the end of July. This de&s;cription applies to the males. The females are always &s;maller; and though they have &s;imilar horns, they are &s;maller and thinner, and even acquire not thickne&s;s with age. The horns are nearly &s;traight, have no furrows, and much re&s;emble tho&s;e of our ca&s;trated he-goats.</P>
<P>In the internal parts, they re&s;emble other ruminating ani|mals. The &s;tomach is compo&s;ed of four different cavities, and the gall-bladder is con&s;iderably large. Their fle&s;h is good, and has nearly the &s;ame ta&s;te with that of the roebuck. The fat is delicious, according to the te&s;timony of the Kamt|&s;chatkan nations. They feed upon herbage. They couple in autumn, and bring forth one or two lambs in the &s;pring.</P>
<P>By the hair, the ta&s;te of the fle&s;h, the figure and vivacity of this animal, it belongs to the cla&s;&s; of the &s;tag. By the permanent horns, it is excluded from this cla&s;s. The circular horns give it &s;ome re&s;emblance to the &s;heep. It is di&s;tingui&s;h|ed from that animal by its vivacity and want of wool. Its hair, its abode upon high rocks, and its frequent combats, make it approach to the goats. But the crooked horns, and the want of a beard, exclude it from this cla&s;s. Should we not rather regard this animal as con&s;tituting a particular cla&s;s, and recogni&s;e it as the <HI>mu&s;imon</HI> of the antients? In a word, it has a &s;trong re&s;emblance to Pliny's de&s;cription of the mu|&s;imon, and &s;till more to that given by the learned Ge&s;ner;&endq; <HI>Relation d'un voyage par terre &agrave; Kamt&s;chatka, par Gmelin.</HI> This curious relation is written by a man of good &s;en&s;e, and much ver&s;ed in natural hi&s;tory.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>We have given the figure of a ram which was
&s;hown at the fair of St. Germain, in the year
<PB N="227" REF="254">
1774, under the name of the <HI>ram of the Cape of
Good Hope.</HI> This &s;ame ram was exhibited, the
year preceding, under the denomination of the
<HI>Mogul ram with a thick tail.</HI> But we learned
that it was purcha&s;ed at Tunis; and we think
that it is the &s;ame with the Barbary &s;heep former|ly
repre&s;ented, from which it differs only by the
&s;hortne&s;s of its tail, which is al&s;o flatter, and
broader in the upper part. The head is likewi&s;e
proportionally thicker, and re&s;embles that of the
Indian ram. The body is well covered with
wool, and the legs are &s;hort, even when com|pared
with tho&s;e of our own &s;heep. The figure
and &s;ize of the horns differ little from tho&s;e of
the Barbary &s;heep. We have called it the <HI>ram
of Tunis,</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the other; but
we are per&s;uaded that they both belong to the
&s;ame country of Barbary, and that they are very
nearly of the &s;ame race.</P>
<P>We have likewi&s;e given the figure of a ram,
which was exhibited at the fair of Saint-Germain,
in the year 1774, under the name of the <HI>mor|vant
of China.</HI> This ram is remarkable for a
kind of mane on his neck, and for long hairs
which hang down from his throat, and form a
kind of cravat. The&s;e hairs are a mixture of
red and gray, hard to the touch, and about ten
inches long. The hairs of the mane are red, not
very thick, extend as far as the middle of the
back, and are of the &s;ame colour and con&s;i&s;tence
as tho&s;e on the throat; but they are &s;horter, and
<PB N="228" REF="255">
mixed with &s;ome brown and black hairs. The
wool which covers the body is a little curled, and
&s;oft at the extremity; but, near the &s;kin of the
animal, it is &s;traight and hard: In general, it is
about three inches long, and of a bright yellow
colour. The legs are of a deep red, and the
head is &s;potted with different &s;hades of yellow.
The greate&s;t part of the tail is yellow and white,
and in figure re&s;embles that of a cow, being well
furni&s;hed with hair toward the extremity. This
ram &s;tands lower on his legs than the common
kind, and he re&s;embles the Indian ram more than
any other. His belly is very large, and not above
fourteen inches nine lines rai&s;ed from the ground.
M. de Seve, who de&s;cribed this animal, adds,
that, from the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of the belly, this ram
had the appearance of a pregnant ewe. The
horns are nearly the &s;ame with tho&s;e of our rams.
But the hoofs are not prominent, and they are
longer than tho&s;e of the Indian ram.</P>
<P>We formerly remarked, and now repeat, that
the mouflon is the primaeval &s;tock of all the o|ther
&s;heep, and that his con&s;titution is &s;ufficient|ly
robu&s;t to enable him to &s;ub&s;i&s;t in cold, tem|perate,
and warm climates. The wild rams of
Kamt&s;chatka, &s;ays M. Steller, have the air of a
goat, and the hair of a rain-deer. Their horns
are &s;o large, that &s;ome of them weigh from
twenty-five to thirty pounds. Spoons and other
uten&s;ils are made of them. The&s;e rams are as
active and nimble as roebucks. They inhabit

white, low on its legs, and had long hair di&s;po&s;ed

that it is found in the warme&s;t countries of A&s;ia.

<P>We formerly remarked, that no &s;pecies<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the article <HI>Fallow deer,</HI> vol. IV. of this work.</NOTE> made
&s;o near an approach to another, as the fallow
deer to the &s;tag. The axis, however, &s;eems to
form an intermediate &s;hade between the two.
It re&s;embles the fallow deer in the &s;ize of the
body, the length of the tail, and in a kind of li|very
which it perpetually wears: There is no
e&s;&s;ential difference but in the horns, which want
brow antlers, and re&s;emble tho&s;e of the &s;tag. The
axis, therefore, may be a variety only, and not a
different &s;pecies from that of the fallow deer;
for, though it is an original native of the warme&s;t
countries of A&s;ia, it ea&s;ily &s;ub&s;i&s;ts and multiplies
in Europe. There are flocks of them in the me|nagerie
of Paris. They produce among them|&s;elves
with equal facility as the fallow deer.
<PB N="234" REF="270">
They have never been ob&s;erved, however, to
intermix with the fallow deer, nor with the &s;tags,
which has led us to pre&s;ume that they are not a
variety either of the one or of the other, but a
di&s;tinct: intermediate &s;pecies. But, as no deci|&s;ive
experiments have been made on this &s;ubject,
as no nece&s;&s;ary means have been u&s;ed to oblige
the&s;e animals to join, we do not a&s;&s;ert po&s;itively
that they belong to different &s;pecies.</P>
<P>We have already &s;een, under the articles <HI>&s;tag</HI>
and <HI>fallow deer,</HI> how liable the&s;e animals are to
varieties, e&s;pecially in the colour of their hair.
The &s;pecies of the fallow deer and &s;tag, without
being numerous in individuals, are very much
diffu&s;ed. Both are found in either Continent,
and both are &s;ubject to a great number of varie|ties,
which &s;eem to form permanent races. The
white &s;tags, who&s;e race is very antient, &s;ince
they are mentioned by the Greeks and Romans,
and the &s;mall brown &s;tags, which we have called
<HI>Cor&s;ican &s;tags,</HI> are not the only varieties of this
&s;pecies. In Germany, there is another race,
known in that country under the name of <HI>Brand|hirtz</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Alterum cervi genus, ignotius, priore majus, pinguius, tu$ pilo den&s;ius et colore nigrius; unde Germanis a &s;emiu&s;ti ligni colore <HI>Brandhirtz</HI> nominatur: Hoc in Mi&s;enae &s;altibus Bo&euml;miae vicinis reperitur; <HI>Fabricius, apud Ge&s;ner, Hi&s;t. quad. p.</HI> 297.</NOTE>,

proper here to give the rea&s;ons which make us
think differently, and lead us to believe, that the
hippelaphus of Ari&s;totle, is the &s;ame animal with
the tragelaphus of Pliny, and that both the&s;e

But, as we formerly remarked, the buffalo and ox are two di&s;tinct &s;pecies. If the antients have be&s;towed no particular name on the buffalo, it is becau&s;e this animal was a stranger to them, becau&s;e their knowledge of him was imperfect, and they regarded him as a wild ox, which differed from the domestic ox by &s;ome &s;light varieties only.</NOTE> gives to his hippelaphus a kind of
mane upon the neck and top of the &s;houlders, a
<PB N="236" REF="272">
beard under the throat, horns to the male &s;imi|lar
to tho&s;e of the roebuck, and no horns to the
female. He &s;ays that the hippelaphus is as large
as the &s;tag, and is produced among the Arachotas,
a people of India, where there are al&s;o wild oxen,
who&s;e bodies are very robu&s;t, their &s;kin black,
their muzzle elevated, and their horns bended
more backward than tho&s;e of the dome&s;tic ox.
It mu&s;t be acknowledged, that Ari&s;totle's cha|racters
of the hippelaphus will apply almo&s;t e|qually
well to the rain deer and to the &s;tag of
Ardennes. They have both long hair upon the
neck and &s;houlders, and likewi&s;e on the throat,
which forms a kind of beard upon the gullet,
and not on the chin. But the hippelaphus, which
is only of the &s;ize of the &s;tag, differs in this par|ticular
from the rain deer, which is much larger;
but what appears to decide this que&s;tion, the rain
deer being an animal peculiar to cold countries,
never exi&s;ted among the Arachotas. This coun|try
of the Arachotas is one of the provinces
which Alexander over-ran in his expedition into
India. It is &s;ituated beyond Mount Cauca&s;us,
<PB N="237" REF="273">
between Per&s;ia and India. This warm country
never produced rain deer; for they cannot &s;ub|&s;i&s;t
in temperate countries, and are found only
in the northern regions of both Continents. The
&s;tags, on the contrary, have no particular attach|ment
to the north; for they are very numerous
both in temperate and warm climates. Hence
the hippelaphus of Ari&s;totle, which is found a|mong
the Arachotas, and in the &s;ame countries
with the buffalo, is unque&s;tionably the &s;tag of
Ardennes, and not the rain deer.</P>
<P>Now, if we compare what Pliny has &s;aid of
the tragelaphus, with what Ari&s;totle has advan|ced
concerning the hippelaphus, and both with
nature, we will perceive that the tragelaphus is
the &s;ame animal with the hippelaphus, and con|&s;equently
the &s;ame with our &s;tag of Ardennes.
Pliny remarks<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Eadem e&s;t &s;pecie (cervi videlicet) barba tantum, et ar|morum villo di&s;tans quem <HI>tragelaphon</HI> vocant, non alibi quam juxta Pha&s;in amnem, na&s;cens; <HI>Plin. Hi&s;t. Nat. lib. 8. cap.</HI> 33,</NOTE> that the tragelaphus belongs to
the &s;pecies of &s;tag, and differs from him only by
the beard and the hair on its &s;houlders. The&s;e
characters are po&s;itive, and can only apply to the
&s;tag of Ardennes; for Pliny, in another place,
mentions the rain deer under the name of <HI>Alca.</HI>
He adds, that the tragelaphus is found in the
neighbourhood of Pha&s;is, which &s;till farther a|grees
with the &s;tag, and not with the rain deer.
We may, therefore, &s;afely pronounce, that the
tragelaphus of Pliny, and the hippelaphus of A|ri&s;totle,
both denote the animal which we call
<PB N="238" REF="274">
the <HI>&s;tag of Ardennes;</HI> and that the axis of Pliny
is the animal commonly denominated the <HI>Ganges

<P>In the year 1765, the Duke of Richmond had,
in his parks, a number of that &s;pecies of the fal|low
deer, commonly known by the name of
<HI>Ganges &s;tags,</HI> and which I have called <HI>axis.</HI> Mr
Colin&s;on a&s;&s;ures me, that they propagated with
the ordinary kind of fallow deer.</P>
<P>&startq;They live &s;pontaneou&s;ly,&endq; he remarks, &startq;with
the fallow deer, and form not &s;eparate flocks.
It is more than &s;ixty years &s;ince this &s;pecies
exi&s;ted in England, where they had been tran&s;|ported
before the white and black fallow deer,
and even before the &s;tag, which la&s;t, I &s;uppo&s;e,
was brought from France; becau&s;e, previous
to that period, there were in England only the
common fallow deer, and the Scots roebuck.
But, be&s;ide this fir&s;t &s;pecies, we have now&punc; the
axis, the black, the yellow, and the white fal|low
deer. The mixture of all the&s;e colours
has produced mo&s;t beautiful varieties<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Lettre de M. Colin&s;on &agrave; M. de Buffon.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>In the year 1764, we had a male and female
Chine&s;e fallow deer at the menagerie of Ver&s;ailles.

In height, they exceeded not two feet four
inches. The body and tail were of a dark brown
colour, and the belly and limbs of a bright yel|low.
The legs were &s;hort, the horns large and
garni&s;hed with antlers. This &s;pecies, though
&s;maller than the common fallow deer, and even
than the axis, is perhaps only a variety of the
latter, though it has no white &s;pots; but, in&s;tead
of the&s;e white &s;pots, it had, in &s;ome places, large
yellow hairs, which had a con&s;iderable effect up|on
the brown colour of the body. In fine, the
colour of the female was the &s;ame as that of the
male; and, it is probable, that the race might not
only be perpetuated in France, but that it might
even intermix with the axis, e&s;pecially as both
the&s;e animals are natives of the ea&s;tern regions
of Africa.</P>

<HEAD>OF NATURE.</HEAD>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>FIRST VIEW.</HEAD>
<P>NATURE is that &s;y&s;tem of laws e&s;tabli&s;hed
by the Creator for regulating the exi&s;|tence
of bodies, and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of beings.
Nature is not a body; for this body would com|prehend
every thing. Neither is it a being;
for this being would nece&s;&s;arily be God. But
Nature may be con&s;idered as an immen&s;e living
power, which animates the univer&s;e, and which,
in &s;ubordination to the fir&s;t and &s;upreme Being,
began to act by his command, and its action is
&s;till continued by his concurrence or con&s;ent.
This power is that portion of the divine power
which manife&s;ts it&s;elf to men. It is at once the
cau&s;e and the effect, the mode and the &s;ub&s;tance,
the de&s;ign and the execution. Very different
from human art, who&s;e productions are only
dead works, Nature is her&s;elf a work perpetual|ly
alive, an active and never cea&s;ing operator,
who knows how to employ every material, and,
though always labouring on the &s;ame invariable
plan, her power, in&s;tead of being le&s;&s;ened, is
perfectly inexhau&s;tible. Time, &s;pace, and mat|ter,
are her means; the univer&s;e her object; mo|tion
and life her end.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="290">
The phaenomena of the univer&s;e are the ef|fects
of this power. The &s;prings &s;he employs
are active forces, which time and &s;pace can only
mea&s;ure and limit, but never de&s;troy; forces which
balance, mix, and oppo&s;e, without being able
to annihilate each other. Some penetrate and
tran&s;port bodies, others heat and animate them.
Attraction and impul&s;ion are the two prin|cipal
in&s;truments by which this power acts
upon brute matter. Heat and organic particles
are the active principles &s;he employs in the for|mation
and expan&s;ion of organized beings.</P>
<P>With &s;uch in&s;truments, what can limit the o|perations
of Nature? To render her omnipotent,
&s;he wants only the power of creating and an|nihilating.
But the&s;e two extremes of power
the Almighty has re&s;erved to him&s;elf alone. To
create and to annihilate, are his peculiar attri|butes.
To change, to de&s;troy, to unfold, to re|new,
to produce, are the only privileges he has
conferred on another agent. Nature, the mini|&s;ter
of his irrevocable commands, the depo&s;itary
of his immutable decrees, never deviates from
the laws he has pre&s;cribed to her. She alters no
part of his original plan; and, in all her opera|tions,
the exhibits the &s;eal of the eternal Lord
of the univer&s;e. This divine impre&s;&s;ion, this
unalterable prototype of all exi&s;tence, is the
model upon which &s;he operates; a model, all
the features of which are expre&s;&s;ed in characters
&s;o &s;trongly marked, that nothing can po&s;&s;ibly ef|face;
<PB N="251" REF="291">
a model which the number of copies or
impre&s;&s;ions, though infinite, in&s;tead of imparing,
only renews.</P>
<P>Every thing, therefore, has been created, and
nothing is annihilated. Nature vibrates between
the&s;e two extremes, without ever approaching
either the one or the other. Let us endeavour
to lay hold of her in &s;ome points of this va&s;t
&s;pace which &s;he has filled and pervaded from the
beginning of ages.</P>
<P>What an infinity of objects! an immen&s;e ma&s;s
of matter, which would have been created in vain,
if it had not been divided into portions, &s;epa|rated
from each other by &s;paces a thou&s;and times
more immen&s;e. Thou&s;ands of luminous globes,
placed at inconceivable di&s;tances, are the ba&s;es
which &s;upport the fabric of the univer&s;e; and
millions of opaque globes, which circulate round
the former, con&s;titute the moving order of its
architecture. The&s;e great ma&s;&s;es are revolved,
and carried through &s;pace, by two primitive
forces, each of which acts continually; and
their combined efforts produce the zones of the
cele&s;tial &s;pheres, and e&s;tabli&s;h, in the mid&s;t of
vacuity, fixed &s;tations and determined routes or
orbits. It is motion that gives ri&s;e to the equi|librium
of worlds, and the repo&s;e of the uni|ver&s;e.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e forces is equally divided;
the &s;econd is di&s;tributed in unequal proportions.
Every atom of matter has the &s;ame quantity of
<PB N="252" REF="292">
attractive force; and a different quantity of im|pul&s;ive
force is a&s;&s;igned to each individual globe.
Some &s;tars are fixed, and others wandering.
Some globes &s;eem to be de&s;tined for attracting,
and others for impelling, or being impelled.
There are &s;pheres which have received a com|mon
impul&s;ion in the &s;ame direction, and others
a particular impul&s;ion. Some &s;tars are &s;olitary,
and others accompanied with &s;atellites: Some
are luminous, and others opaque ma&s;&s;es. There
are planets, the different parts of which &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively
enjoy a borrowed light, and comets, which
lo&s;e them&s;elves in the profundity of &s;pace, and
return, after many ages, to receive the influence
of &s;olar heat. Some &s;uns appear and di&s;appear,
and &s;eem to be alternately kindled and extingui&s;h|ed;
others exhibit them&s;elves for once, and then
vani&s;h forever. Heaven is a country of great e|vents;
but the human eye is hardly able to per|ceive
them. A &s;un, which peri&s;hes, and de&s;troys
a world, or a &s;y&s;tem of worlds, has no other
effect on our eyes than an ignis fatuus, which
gives a tran&s;itory blaze, and appears no more.
Man, limited to the terre&s;trial atom on which
he vegetates, views this atom as a world, and
&s;ees worlds only as atoms.</P>
<P>The earth which man inhabits, hardly per|ceptable
among the other globes, and totally
invi&s;ible to the di&s;tant &s;pheres, is a million of
times &s;maller than the &s;un by which it is illumi|nated,
and a thou&s;and times &s;maller than &s;ome
ether planets, which are al&s;o &s;ubjected to the
<PB N="253" REF="293">
power of the &s;un, and obliged to circulate a|round
him. Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Earth,
Venus, Mercury, and the Sun, occupy the &s;mall
part of the heavens which we call <HI>our Univer&s;e.</HI>
All the&s;e planets with their &s;atellites, moving
with rapidity in the &s;ame direction, and nearly
in the &s;ame plane, compo&s;e a wheel of an im|men&s;e
diameter, who&s;e axis &s;upports the whole
weight, and which, by the celerity of its own
rotation, mu&s;t inflame and diffu&s;e heat and light
to every part of the circumference. As long as
the&s;e movements continue, (and they will be e|ternal,
unle&s;s the hand of the prime Mover inter|po&s;e,
and exert as much force to de&s;troy, as was
nece&s;&s;ary to create them), the &s;un will burn, and
fill all the &s;pheres of this univer&s;e with his &s;plen|dour:
And as, in a &s;y&s;tem where all bodies at|tract
each other, nothing can be lo&s;t, or remove
without returning, the quantity of matter remain|ing
always the &s;ame, this fertile &s;ource of light
and life can never be dried up or exhau&s;ted; for
the other &s;uns, which likewi&s;e dart forth their
fires continually, re&s;tore to our &s;un as much light
as they receive from him.</P>
<P>The comets, which are much more numerous
than the planets, and, like the latter, depend on
the power of the &s;un, pre&s;s al&s;o on this common
focus, and, by augmenting the weight, increa&s;e
the inflammation. They con&s;titute a part of our
univer&s;e; for, like the planets, they are &s;ubjec|ted
to the attraction of the &s;un. But, in their
<PB N="254" REF="294">
projectile or impelled motions, they have no|thing
in common, either among them&s;elves, or
with the planets. Each circulates in a different
plane; and they de&s;cribe orbits in very different
periods of time; for &s;ome perform their revolu|tions
in a few years, and others require &s;everal
centuries. The &s;un, revolving round his own
centre, remains, in other re&s;pects, perfectly at
re&s;t in the mid&s;t of the whole, and &s;erves, at the
&s;ame time, as a torch, a focus, and an axis to all
the parts of this va&s;t machine.</P>
<P>It is by his magnitude alone that the &s;un re|mains
immoveable, and regulates the motions of
the other globes. As the force of attraction is
proportioned to the ma&s;s of matter, as the &s;un
is incomparably larger than any of the comets,
and contains a thou&s;and times more matter than
the large&s;t planet, they can neither derange him,
nor dimini&s;h his influence, which, by extending
to immen&s;e di&s;tances, re&s;trains the whole, and,
at fixed periods, recalls tho&s;e which have &s;tretch|ed
farthe&s;t into the regions of &s;pace. Some of
them, when they return, make &s;o near an ap|proach
to the &s;un, that, after cooling for ages,
they undergo an inconceivable degree of heat.
They are &s;ubjected to &s;trange vici&s;&s;itudes from
the&s;e alternate extremes of heat and cold, as
well as from the inequalities of their motions,
which are &s;ometimes prodigiou&s;ly accelerated, and
at other times almo&s;t infinitely retarded. When
compared with the planets, the comets may be
<PB N="255" REF="295">
con&s;idered as worlds in di&s;order; for the orbits
of the planets are more regular, and their move|ments
more equal; their temperature is always
the &s;ame; they &s;eem to be places of repo&s;e,
where, every thing being permanent, Nature is
enabled to e&s;tabli&s;h a uniform plan of operation,
and to mature &s;ucce&s;&s;ively all her various pro|ductions.
Among the planets, that which we
inhabit &s;eems to enjoy peculiar privileges. Le&s;s
cold and le&s;s di&s;tant than Saturn, Jupiter, and
Mars, it is al&s;o not &s;o much &s;corched as Venus
and Mercury, who appear to be too near the
body of the &s;un. Be&s;ides, with what magnifi|cence
does Nature &s;hine upon the earth? A
pure light, which gradually &s;tretches from ea&s;t
to we&s;t, alternately gilds both hemi&s;pheres of
this globe. It is &s;urrounded with a light and
tran&s;parent element. A mild and fertile heat
animates and unfolds all the germs of exi&s;|tence;
and they are nouri&s;hed and &s;upported by
whole&s;ome waters. Various eminences, di&s;tribu|ted
over the &s;urface of the land, &s;top and collect
the moi&s;t vapours which float in the air, and give
ri&s;e to perpetual fountains. Immen&s;e cavities,
de&s;tined for the reception of the&s;e waters, &s;epa|rate
i&s;lands and continents. The extent of the
&s;ea is as great as that of the land. This is not
a cold and barren element. It is a new empire
equally rich, and equally peopled with the for|mer.
The limits of the waters are marked out
by the finger of God. If the &s;ea encroaches on
<PB N="256" REF="296">
the we&s;tern &s;hores, it de&s;erts tho&s;e of the ea&s;t.
This va&s;t ma&s;s of water, though naturally inac|tive,
is agitated by the influence of the cele&s;tial
bodies, which produces the regular motions of
the flux and reflux. It ri&s;es and falls with the
cour&s;e of the moon; and, when the action of the
&s;un and moon concurs, it ri&s;es &s;till higher. Both
the&s;e cau&s;es uniting during the time of the e|quinoxes,
is the rea&s;on why the tides are then
highe&s;t. This is the &s;tronge&s;t mark of our
connection with the heavens. The&s;e con&s;tant
and general movements give ri&s;e to variable and
particular motions; to tran&s;portations of earth,
which, falling to the bottom in the form of &s;e|diment,
produce mountains &s;imilar to tho&s;e on
the &s;urface of the land; to currents, which, fol|lowing
the direction of tho&s;e chains of moun|tains,
be&s;tow on them a figure who&s;e angles cor|re&s;pond,
and, running in the mid&s;t of the waves,
as waters run on the land, are really &s;ea-rivers.</P>
<P>The air, &s;till lighter and more fluid than
water, is likewi&s;e &s;ubject to a number of powers.
Continual agitations are produced in it by the
di&s;tant influence of the &s;un and moon, by the
immediate action of the &s;ea, and by the rarefac|tion
and conden&s;ation of heat and cold. The
winds are its currents. They pu&s;h and col|lect
the clouds. They produce meteors, and
tran&s;port to the arid &s;urface of i&s;lands and con|tinents
the moi&s;t vapours of the ocean. They
give ri&s;e to &s;torms, and diffu&s;e and di&s;tribute
<PB N="257" REF="297">
the fertile dew and rains. They di&s;turb the
movements of the &s;ea, agitate the waters, &s;top
or precipitate the currents, elevate the waves,
and rai&s;e tremendous tempe&s;ts: The troubled
ocean ri&s;es toward the heavens, and rolls on
with noi&s;e and violence again&s;t tho&s;e immove|able
barriers, which, with all its efforts, it can
neither de&s;troy nor &s;urmount.</P>
<P>The earth, elevated above the level of the o|cean,
is defended again&s;t its irruptions. Its &s;ur|face,
enamelled with flowers, adorned with a
verdure which is always renewing, and peo|pled
with numberle&s;s &s;pecies of animals, is a
place of perfect repo&s;e, a delightful habitation,
where man, de&s;tined to aid the intentions of Na|ture,
pre&s;ides over every other being. He a|lone
is capable of knowledge, and dignified with
the faculty of admiration: God, therefore, has
made him the &s;pectator of the univer&s;e, and the
witne&s;s of his perpetual miracles. The ray of
divinity with which he is animated, makes him
participate the my&s;teries of the Deity. It is by
this light that he thinks and reflects, that he
perceives and under&s;tands the wonderful opera|tions
of his Creator.</P>
<P>Nature is the external throne of the divine
magnificence. Man who contemplates her, ri&s;es
gradually to the internal throne of the Almighty.
Formed to adore his Creator, he has dominion
over every creature. The va&s;&s;al of heaven, the
lord of the earth, he peoples, ennobles, and
enriches this lower world. Among living be|ings,
<PB N="258" REF="298">
he e&s;tabli&s;hes order, &s;ubordination, and har|mony.
To Nature her&s;elf he even gives im|belli&s;hment,
cultivation, exten&s;ion, and poli&s;h.
He cuts down the thi&s;tle and the bramble, and
he multiplies the vine and the ro&s;e. View tho&s;e
melancholy de&s;erts where man has never re&s;i|ded.
Over-run with briers, thorns, and trees
which are deformed, broken, corrupted, the &s;eeds
that ought to renew and embelli&s;h the &s;cene
are choaked and buried in the mid&s;t of rubbi&s;h
and &s;terility. Nature, who, in other &s;ituations,
a&s;&s;umes the &s;plendour of youth, has here the ap|pearance
of old age and decrepitude. The earth,
&s;urcharged with the &s;poils of its productions, in|&s;tead
of a beautiful verdure, pre&s;ents nothing
but a di&s;ordered ma&s;s of gro&s;s herbage, and of trees
loaded with para&s;itical plants, as lichens, agarics,
and other impure fruits of corruption: All the
low grounds are occupied with putrid and &s;tag|nating
waters; the miry lands, which are nei|ther

<P>WHETHER we con&s;ider &s;ymmetry of
&s;hape, or beauty of colours, the zebra
is perhaps the mo&s;t elegant of all quadrupeds.
In this animal, the figure and gracefulne&s;s of the
hor&s;e are united with the nimblene&s;s of the &s;tag.
His robe is adorned with black and white belts
or ribbons, alternately di&s;po&s;ed, with &s;uch regu|larity
and exact proportion, that Nature &s;eems
here to have employed the rule and the compa&s;s.
The&s;e alternate bands of black and white are the
more &s;ingular, becau&s;e they are &s;traight, parallel,
and as nicely &s;eparated as tho&s;e of a &s;triped
&s;tuff. Be&s;ides, they extend not only over the
body, but the head, thighs, legs, and even the
<PB N="265" REF="305">
ears and tail; &s;o that, at a di&s;tance, the whole
body of the animal has the appearance of being
artificially adorned, in the mo&s;t elegant manner,
with ribbons. In the female, the&s;e bands are
alternately black and white, and black and yel|low
in the male. The &s;hades are always lively
and brilliant; and the hair is &s;hort, clo&s;e, and
fine, the lu&s;tre of which augments the beauty of
the colours. The zebra, in general, is &s;maller
than the hor&s;e, and larger than the a&s;s. Though
he has often been compared to the&s;e two ani|mals,
under the names of the <HI>wild hor&s;e</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Equus ferus genere &s;uo; zebra; <HI>Klein, de quad. p.</HI> 5.</NOTE>, and

&s;hould rather be regarded as their model, if in
Nature every &s;pecies were not equally original,
and had not an equal right to creation.</P>
<P>The zebra, therefore, is neither a hor&s;e nor
an a&s;s; for, though it has often been attempted,
we never learned that they intermixed and pro|duced
together. She-a&s;&s;es in &s;ea&s;on were pre|&s;ented
to the zebra which was in the menagerie
of Ver&s;ailles in the year 1761. He di&s;dained
them, or rather di&s;covered no emotion. He,
however, &s;ported with them, and even mounted
them, but without di&s;covering any de&s;ire, or ex|ternal
&s;ign. This coldne&s;s could be attributed
to no other cau&s;e than an un&s;uitablene&s;s in the
<PB N="266" REF="306">
natures of the two animals; for the zebra was
four years of age, and, in every other exerci&s;e,
was &s;prightly and vigorous.</P>
<P>The zebra is not the animal mentioned by the
antients under the name of <HI>onager.</HI> In the Le|vant,
in the ea&s;tern parts of A&s;ia, and in the
north of Africa, there is a fine race of a&s;&s;es,
which, like the mo&s;t beautiful hor&s;es, originated
in Arabia<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In Per&s;ia there are two kinds of a&s;&s;es; tho&s;e belonging to the country, which, like ours, are &s;low and &s;tupid, and u&s;ed for carrying burdens only; and the Arabian a&s;&s;es, which are extremely hand&s;ome, and the mo&s;t excellent of the &s;pecies. They have &s;mooth hair, a high head, and nimble limbs. They are u&s;ed &s;olely for riding&hellip;.Like hor&s;es, they are train|ed to amble; and their motion is extremely &s;oft, and &s;o fleet, that it requires a gallop to keep up with them; <HI>Voyage de Chardin, tom. 2. p. 27. Voyage de Tavernier, tom. 2. p.</HI> 20.</NOTE>. This race differs from the com|mon
kind by the largene&s;s of its body, the
nimblene&s;s of its limbs, and the lu&s;tre of its hair.
They are of one uniform colour, which is a
beautiful mou&s;e gray, with a black cro&s;s on the
back and &s;houlders. Sometimes their colour is
a brighter gray, with a whiti&s;h cro&s;s<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">At Ba&s;&s;ora, I &s;aw a wild a&s;s. Its figure differed not from that of the dome&s;tic kind; but its colour was brighter, and, from the head to the tail, there was a band of whiti&s;h hair&hellip;.In running, and in every other motion, it &s;eemed to be much more nimble than the common kind; <HI>Voyage de Pietra della Val$e, tom. 8. p.</HI> 49.</NOTE>. The&s;e
African and A&s;iatic a&s;&s;es<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Moors, who come to Cape-Verd to traffick, carry their baggage and wares upon a&s;&s;es. The&s;e animals were &s;o beautiful and &s;o &s;mooth &s;kinned, that it was with difficulty I could recogni&s;e them to be a&s;&s;es. Tho&s;e of Europe, I ima|gine, would be in the &s;ame condition, if their labour and the manner in which they are loaded did not greatly disfigure them. Their hair was of a beautiful, &s;hining, mou&s;e gray colour, upon which the black band along the back, and acro&s;s the &s;houlders, had a fine effect. The&s;e a&s;&s;es are a little lar|ger than ours. Their head, however, is ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hable from that of the hor&s;e, e&s;pecially the Barbary hor&s;e, which is a native of this country, and of a &s;till higher &s;tature; <HI>Voyage au Senegal, par M. Adan&s;on, p.</HI> 148.&mdash;There are great num|bers of wild a&s;&s;es in the de&s;erts of Numidia and Lybia, and the adjacent country. They are &s;o fleet, that the Barbary hor&s;es alone are able to overtake them in the cour&s;e. As &s;oon as they &s;ee a man, they &s;top, fling up their heels, and cry; and, when he is near, they run off. They are taken by various kinds of &s;nares. They go in troops to pa&s;ture and to drink. Their fle&s;h is very good; but it mu&s;t be allowed to cool two days after being roa&s;ted, on account of its &s;trong &s;mell.

The onagers differ from the do|me&s;tic
a&s;&s;es by tho&s;e qualities only which re&s;ult
from freedom and independence: They are
&s;tronger and more nimble, and they have more
courage and vivacity. The figure of their bodies
<PB N="268" REF="308">
is the &s;ame, though their hair is longer. This
difference depends likewi&s;e on their condition;
for our a&s;&s;es would have hair equally long, if
they were not &s;horn at the age of four or five
months. The hair of a colt is at fir&s;t nearly as
long as that of a young bear. The &s;kin of the
wild a&s;s is equally hard as that of the dome&s;tic
kind, and we are a&s;&s;ured that it is full of &s;mall
tubercles. The chagrin brought from the Le|vant,
which we employ for various purpo&s;es, is
&s;aid to be made of the wild a&s;s's &s;kin.</P>
<P>But, neither the onager, nor the fine a&s;&s;es of
Arabia, can be regarded as the origin of the
zebra &s;pecies, though they re&s;emble it in figure
and &s;wiftne&s;s. None of them exhibit that re|gular
variety of colours, by which the zebra is &s;o
eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed. This beautiful &s;pecies
is &s;ingular, and very remote from all other kinds.
It likewi&s;e belongs to a different climate from

Two &s;imilar a&s;&s;es, belonging to the &s;ame amba&s;&s;ador, died on the road, and he was carrying their &s;kins, together with the animal that &s;urvived, as a pre&s;ent to the Grand Seignior; <HI>Relat. d'un voyage, par Thevenot tom.

In fine, almo&s;t all tho&s;e we have &s;een in Europe
came from the Cape of Good Hope. This point
of Africa is their native climate, where they are
very numerous, and where the Dutch have ex|erted
every effort to tame and render them do|me&s;tic;
but they have not hitherto been able fully
to accompli&s;h this purpo&s;e. The zebra, which
was the &s;ubject of our de&s;cription, was extremely
wild when he arrived at the royal menagerie, and
is not yet entirely tamed. They have, however,
brought him the length of being mounted; but
it requires great precaution. Two men hold
the bridle, while a third &s;its on the animal's back.
His mouth is extremely hard: His ears are &s;o
&s;en&s;ible, that he flings whenever they are touch|ed,
and, like a vicious hor&s;e, he is re&s;tle&s;s, and as
&s;tubborn as a mule. But the wild hor&s;e and the
onager are perhaps equally untractable; and it
is extremely probable, that, if the zebra were
early accu&s;tomed to obedience, and to a dome|&s;tic
&s;tate, he would become equally gentle with
the a&s;s and hor&s;e, and might &s;upply the place of
both.</P>

<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>The a&s;s, either in a dome&s;tic or wild &s;tate, is
found in almo&s;t every warm and temperate cli|mate
of the Old Continent, and exi&s;ted not in
the New when it was fir&s;t di&s;covered. But the
&s;pecies, after being tran&s;ported thither from Eu|rope,
has now &s;ub&s;i&s;ted and multiplied greatly in
America, during more than two centuries; &s;o
that, at pre&s;ent, it is almo&s;t equally diffu&s;ed over
the four quarters of the globe. The zebra, on
the contrary, which was brought to us from the
Cape of Good Hope, &s;eems to be a &s;pecies limit|ed
to the &s;outhern regions of Africa, though
Lopez a&s;&s;erts, that the zebras are more frequent
in Barbary than in Congo, and though Dapper
relates, that troops of them are found in the
fore&s;ts of Angola.</P>
<P>This beautiful animal, which, both from the
variety of its colours and the elegance of its fi|gure,
is &s;o &s;uperior to the a&s;s, &s;eems, notwith|&s;tanding,
to be nearly of the &s;ame &s;pecies; &s;ince
mo&s;t travellers give it the name of the <HI>&s;triped a&s;s,</HI>
becau&s;e, at fir&s;t &s;ight, they were struck with
its &s;uperior re&s;emblance, both in &s;ize and figure,
to the a&s;s than to the hor&s;e; for it was not with
the &s;mall common a&s;&s;es that they compared the
zebra, but with the large&s;t and mo&s;t beautiful of
<PB N="273" REF="313">
the &s;pecies. I am &s;till inclined to think, how|ever,
that the zebra approaches nearer to the
hor&s;e than the a&s;s; for his figure is &s;o elegant,
that though, in general, he is le&s;s than the hor&s;e,
the &s;imilarities between them, in other re&s;pects,
are very apparent. To confirm this opinion, it
has been remarked, with &s;ome degree of &s;urpri&s;e,
that, in the neighbourhood of the Cape of Good
Hope, which appears to be the native country of
the true zebra, there are hor&s;es &s;potted on the
back and belly with yellow, black, red, and a|zure<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Captain Robert's voyage, tom. 1. p. 94.</NOTE>.
This particular argument is &s;upported
by the general fact, that, in all climates, the co|lour
of the hor&s;e varies more than that of the
a&s;s. We pretend not to decide this que&s;tion;
but we hope that it will &s;oon be determined. As
the Dutch have lately tran&s;ported great numbers
of the&s;e elegant animals, and have even yoked
them in the Stadtholder's chariot, it is probable
that, in a &s;hort time, we &s;hall receive informa|tion
of every thing relating to their nature. That
indu&s;trious nation cannot fail to make the&s;e a|nimals
unite among them&s;elves, and perhaps
with hor&s;es and a&s;&s;es, in order to produce direct
or ba&s;tard races. In Holland, there are &s;everal
expert naturali&s;ts who will perhaps &s;ucceed bet|ter
than we did in the multiplication of the ze|bra,
upon which only a &s;ingle experiment was
made at the royal menagerie in the year 1761.
The male, which was four years of age, di&s;dain|ed
<PB N="274" REF="314">
the &s;he-a&s;&s;es, though in &s;ea&s;on, and no more
were pre&s;ented to him. Perhaps he was al&s;o
too young. Be&s;ides, he was not rendered fami|liar
with the females, a nece&s;&s;ary preliminary
for &s;ucceeding in the union of different &s;pecies,
which Nature &s;eems to require even in the in|tercour&s;e
of individuals of the &s;ame &s;pecies.</P>
<P>The fertile mule of Tartary, called <HI>czigithai,</HI>
may perhaps be an animal of the &s;ame &s;pecies
with the zebra; for there &s;eems to be no differ|ence
between them, but in colour. Now, it is
well known, that the differences in the colour
of the hair or feathers are extremely &s;light, and
depend on the influence of the climate. The
czigithai is found in the &s;outhern parts of Sibe|ria,
in Thibet, in Dauria, and in Tartary. Ger|billon
remarks, that the&s;e animals are common
in the country of the Mongoux and Kakas;
that they differ from dome&s;tic mules; and that
they cannot be trained to bear burdens<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. gen. des Voyages, tom. 6. p. 601.</NOTE>. Mul|ler
and Gmelin a&s;&s;ure us, that they are nume|rous
in the country of the Tongu&s;ians, where
they are hunted like other game; that, in Sibe|ria,
toward Borsja, they are very plenty in dry
years; and he adds, that they re&s;emble, in fi|gure,
&s;ize, and colour, a bright bay hor&s;e, ex|cept
that they have very long ears<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Voyage de M. Muller et Gmelin, tom, 2. p. 105. 107.</NOTE>, and a tail
like that of a cow. If the&s;e travellers who ex|amined
<PB N="275" REF="315">
the czigithai had, at the &s;ame time,
compared it with the zebra, they would per|haps
have di&s;covered a greater number of rela|tions
than we are apt to imagine. In the Pe|ter&s;burg
cabinet there are &s;tuffed &s;kins both of
the zebra and czigithai. Though the&s;e &s;kins
differ in colour, they may belong to the &s;ame,
or a very neighbouring &s;pecies. Time alone
can remove or confirm the&s;e conjectures. But,
as all the other animals of Africa are likewi&s;e
found in A&s;ia, if the zebra and czigithai are not
of the &s;ame &s;pecies, the zebra alone would be an
exception to this general rule.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, if the czigithai is not the &s;ame with
the zebra, it may be the A&s;iatic animal called
<HI>onager</HI> or <HI>wild a&s;s.</HI> The onager &s;hould not
be confounded with the zebra; but I am un|certain
whether the &s;ame remark is applicable
to the onager and czigithai; for, from compa|ring
the relations of travellers, it appears, that
there are different kinds of wild a&s;&s;es, of which
the onager is the mo&s;t remarkable. Perhaps
the hor&s;e, the a&s;s, the onager, and the czigithai,
con&s;titute four di&s;tinct &s;pecies: And, on the
&s;uppo&s;ition that they are only three, it is &s;till
uncertain whether the czigithai be an onager
or a zebra. The &s;wiftne&s;&s; of the onager is
mentioned by travellers, who remark, that he
runs with &s;uch rapidity as to e&s;cape the hunters,
though mounted on hor&s;es; and they &s;ay the
&s;ame thing of the czigithai. However this
<PB N="276" REF="316">
matter &s;tands, the hor&s;e, the a&s;s, the zebra, and
the czigithai, belong to the &s;ame genus, and
con&s;titute three or four branches of the &s;ame
family: The two fir&s;t of which have long been
reduced to a dome&s;tic &s;tate; which gives us rea|&s;on
to hope, that the two la&s;t may likewi&s;e be
tamed, and prove a u&s;eful acqui&s;ition to man|kind.</P>

any exact knowledge concerning this animal
mu&s;t be brought forward to the year 1603,
when Federico Zerenghi, a &s;urgeon of Narni in
Italy, printed at Naples the hi&s;tory of two hip|popotami
which he had taken alive in a great
ditch dug on purpo&s;e in the neighbourhood of
the Nile, near Damietta. This little book was
written in Italian; and, though it be the on|ly.
<PB N="280" REF="322">
thing original we have upon this &s;ubject, it
&s;eems to have been totally neglected both by
contemporary and &s;ucceeding naturali&s;ts. The
de&s;cription it contains of the hippopotamus is, at
the &s;ame time, &s;o good, and appears &s;o worthy
of credit, that I &s;hall here give an extract and
tran&s;lation of it.</P>
<P>&startq;With a view,&endq; &s;ays Zerenghi, &startq;of obtaining
an hippopotamus, I &s;tationed men upon the
Nile, who, having &s;een two of the&s;e animals go
out of the river, made a large ditch in the way
through which they pa&s;&s;ed, and covered it with
thin planks, earth, and herbage. In the even|ing,
when returning to the river, they both fell
into the ditch. I was immediately informed
of the event, and ha&s;tened to the place along
with my Jani&s;&s;ary. We killed both the ani|mals
by pouring three &s;hot into each of their
heads from a large arquebu&s;e. They almo&s;t
in&s;tantly expired, after uttering a cry which
had more re&s;emblance to the bellowing of
a buffalo, than to the neighing of a hor&s;e.
This exploit was performed on the 20th day
of July 1600. The following day, they were
drawn out of the ditch, and carefully &s;kinned.
The one was a male, and the other a female.
I cau&s;ed their &s;kins to be &s;alted, and &s;tuffed
with the leaves of the &s;ugar cane, in order to
tran&s;port them to Cairo, where they were
&s;alted a &s;econd time with more attention and
convenience. Each &s;kin required four hun|dred
pounds of &s;alt. On my return from E|gypt,
<PB N="281" REF="323">
in 1601, I brought the&s;e &s;kins to Venice,
and from thence to Rome. I &s;howed them
to &s;everal intelligent phy&s;icians. Doctor
Jerome Aquapendente and the celebrated Al|drovandus
were the only per&s;ons who recog|ni&s;ed
them to be the &s;poils of the hippopota|mus;
and, as Aldrovandus's work was then
printing, I allowed him to draw a figure from
the &s;kin of the female, which he in&s;erted in
his book.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The &s;kin of the hippopotamus is very thick,
and very hard; it is even impenetrable, un|le&s;s
after being long &s;teeped in water. The
mouth is not, as the antients alledge, of a
middle &s;ize, but enormou&s;ly large. Neither
are his feet divided into two toes, but in|to
four. His &s;ize is not that of an a&s;s;
for he is much larger than the large&s;t hor&s;e or
buffalo. His tail re&s;embles not that of a hog,
but rather that of the tortoi&s;e, only it is in|comparably
larger. His muzzle is not turned
up, but re&s;embles that of the buffalo, and is
much larger. He has no mane, but only a
few &s;hort, &s;cattered hairs. He neighs not like
a hor&s;e; but his voice is a medium between
the bellowing of a buffalo and the neighing
of a hor&s;e. He has no tu&s;ks which protrude
out of the mouth; for, when the mouth is
&s;hut, the teeth, though extremely large, are all
concealed within the lips&hellip;&hellip; The inha|bitants

to this animal the teeth of the hor&s;e, which
would lead us to think, contrary to his own

<P>&startq;With regard to the figure of the hippopo|tamus,
it appears to be a medium between

&s;ome &s;imilarity to tho&s;e of the buffalo or hor&s;e,
though they are much longer. The colour
of the body is du&s;ky and blacki&s;h&hellip;.. We
are a&s;&s;ured that the hippopotamus produces
but one at a time; that he lives upon fi&s;hes,
crocodiles, and even cadaverous fle&s;h. He
eats, however, rice, grain, &amp;c. though, if we
con&s;ider the &s;tructure of his teeth, it would
appear that Nature had not de&s;tined him for
pa&s;ture, but for devouring other animals.&endq;</P>
<P>Zerenghi fini&s;hes his de&s;cription by inform|ing
us, that all the&s;e mea&s;ures had been taken
from the female &s;ubject, and that the male per|fectly
re&s;embled her, except that, in all his
dimen&s;ions, he was one third larger. It were to
be wi&s;hed that the figure given by Zerenghi had
been equally good as his de&s;cription: This ani|mal,
however, was not drawn from the life, but
from the &s;kin of the female. It likewi&s;e ap|pears,
that Fabius Columna took his figure from
the &s;ame &s;kin, which was pre&s;erved in &s;alt. But
Columna's de&s;cription is not equal to that of
Zerenghi; and he even merits reproach for men|tioning
only the name, and not the work, of this
author, though it was publi&s;hed three years before
his own. For example, Columna remarks, that,
in his time, (1603), Federico Zerenghi brought
from Egypt to Italy an entire hippopotamus,
pre&s;erved in &s;alt, though Zerenghi him&s;elf tells
<PB N="286" REF="328">
us, that he brought only the &s;kin. Columna makes
the body of his hippopotamus thirteen feet long<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Hippopotami a nobis con&s;pecti ac dimen&s;i corpus a capite ad caudam pedes erat tredecim, corporis latitudo five diame|ter pedes quatuor cum dimidio, eju&s;dem altitudo pedes tres cum dimidio, ut planum potius quam carino&s;um ventrem habeat: Orbis corporis quantum longitudo erat: Cr$ra e terra ad ventrem pedes tres cum dimidio: Ambitus crurum pedes tres; pes latus pedem; ungulae &s;ingulae uncias tres: caput vero latum pedes d$o cum dimidio, longum pedes tres; cra&s;&s;um ambitu pedes &s;eptem cum dimidio: Oris rictus pedem $num, &amp;c.

But this circum&s;tance will not ju&s;tify him; for the body of his hippopotamus being thirteen feet long, its circumference ought to have been only eleven feet &s;even or eight inches, and not fourteen feet.

can have no dependence, therefore, on Colum|na's
de&s;cription: Neither can he be excu&s;ed by
&s;uppo&s;ing that his de&s;cription was taken from
another &s;ubject; for it is evident, from his own

It was &s;oon brought to Cairo, where I &s;aw it in the month of February of the &s;ame year; but it was dead. This animal was of a kind of tawny colour. Behind he re&s;embled the buffalo; but his legs were &s;horter and thicker. He was as tall as a camel. His muzzle re&s;embled that of an ox; but his body was twice as large. His head was &s;imilar to that of a hor&s;e, but larger. His eyes were &s;mall, his neck very thick, his ears &s;mall, his no&s;trils very large and open, his feet very large, almo&s;t round, with four toes on each, like tho&s;e of the crocodile, and his tail &s;mall. Like the elephant, he had little or no hair on the &s;kin. In the under jaw, he had four large teeth, about half a foot in length. Two of them were crooked, and as thick as the horns of an ox. At fir&s;t, he was mi&s;taken for a &s;ea buffalo. But I, and &s;ome others, who had read de&s;crip|tions of this animal, knew it to be a &s;ea hor&s;e. It was brought dead to Cairo by the Jani&s;&s;aries, who &s;hot it on land, where it had come to feed. They poured &s;everal &s;hots into it before it fell; for, as I formerly remarked, a mu&s;ket ball hardly pierces its &s;kin. But one ball entered its jaw, and brought it to the ground. None of the&s;e animals had been &s;een at Cairo for a long time; <HI>Relat. d'un voyage du Levant, par Thevenot, tom. 1. p.</HI> 491.</NOTE>, it appears that the hippo|potamus
<PB N="288" REF="330">
is an animal who&s;e body is longer, and
as thick as that of the rhinoceros; that his legs
are much &s;horter<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The legs of the hippopotamus a$e &s;o &s;hort, that the belly of the animal, when he walks, is not more t$an four inches above the ground; <HI>$word$ des poi&s;&s;ons, p. 17.&mdash;Crura e terra ad $word$ p$des tres c$$n dimidio;</HI> Fabius Columna, p. 31. The te&s;timonies of Belon and Columna, with regard to the length of the legs, differ &s;o widely, than none of their dimensions can be adopted. It mu&s;t be remarked, that the hippopota|mus which Belon &s;aw alive, was very young and very fat; that, of cour&s;e, his belly mu&s;t have been large and pendulous; that, on the contrary, the &s;kin de&s;cribed by Columna, which was the &s;ame with that of Zerenghi, had been dried with &s;alt, and, con&s;equently, Columna could not be certain that the belly of the animal was not <HI>round,</HI> but <HI>flat.</HI> Thus the mea&s;ures of Belon are too &s;hort for an adult hippopotamus, and tho&s;e of Columna too long for a living one. Hence we may infer from both, that, in general, the belly of this ani|mal is not above a foot and a half from the ground; and that, as Zerenghi remarks, its legs exceed not two feet in length.</NOTE>; that his head is not &s;o long,

&s;u&s;picious, and, in my opinion, only proves that
this animal is common in Mo&s;ambique, and all
the ea&s;tern parts of Africa. At pre&s;ent, the hip|popotamus,

Adan&s;on<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In going up the Niger, we came to a quarter where the hippopotami or river-hor&s;es are very common. This animal, which is the large&s;t of the amphibious kind, is found only in the rivers of Africa, and in no other part of the world. He is generally &s;aid to be of the figure of an ox; and, indeed, he re&s;embles that animal more than any other. But his legs are &s;horter, and his head is enormou&s;ly large. With regard to &s;ize, the hippopotamus may be ranked after the elephant and rhinoceros. His jaws are armed with four tu&s;ks, by which he tears up the roots of trees, which &s;erve him for food. He cannot remain long under water without re&s;piring, which ob|liges him to rai&s;e his head, from time to time, above the &s;ur|face, like the crocodile; <HI>Voyage au Senegal, par M.

When pre&s;&s;ed with hunger, he comes out of the water, in which he lies always in an extended po&s;ture. When he rai&s;es his head above the water, he looks about on all &s;ides to &s;ee if there is any danger, and he &s;cents a man at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance. If he perceives any thing, he plunges again into the water, where he continues three hours without moving&hellip;. He generally weighs from two thou&s;and five hundred to three thou&s;and pounds&hellip;. The &s;ea-hor&s;e, both in colour and &s;ize, re&s;embles the rhinoceros, only his legs are &s;omewhat &s;horter. His head, as Tellez remarks, (lib. 1, chap. 8.) has a greater re&s;emblance to that of the hor&s;e, than to that of any other animal; and, from this circum&s;tance, he has derived his name. His mouth is much larger than that of the hor&s;e, and, in this re&s;pect, he approaches nearer the ox. His no&s;trils are very large; and, when he ri&s;es to the &s;urface of the river or &s;ea, he &s;quirts the water out of them. His ears and eyes are remarkably &s;mall. His legs are &s;hort, and of an equal thickne&s;s throughout. His hoofs are not divided into two, like tho&s;e of the ox, but into four parts, on each of which there are &s;piral furrows. His tail is &s;hort like that of the elephant, with a few &s;hort hairs on it; and there is no hair on the re&s;t of the body.</P>
<P>The paps of the female hang, like tho&s;e of the cow, be|tween the hind legs; but they, as well as the teats, are very &s;mall in proportion to the &s;ize of the animal. I have often &s;een the mothers &s;uckling their young, which were then as large as &s;heep&hellip; The &s;kin of the river-hor&s;e is more than an inch thick, and &s;o hard that it is difficult to kill him even with mu&s;ket balls. The Europeans always aim at his head, where the &s;kin is mo&s;t tender, and ea&s;ily pierced. This ani|mal &s;eldom receives a mortal wound in any other part of his body.</P>
<P>The teeth of the under jaw are very remarkable. They are four in number, two on each &s;ide, one of them crooked and, the other &s;traight. They are as thick as an ox's horn, about a foot and a half long, and each of them weighs twelve pounds. They are very white, and never turn yellow with age, as ivory does. Hence they are more e&s;teemed than the teeth of the elephant.</P>
<P>The fle&s;h of this animal, whether boiled or roa&s;ted, is mo&s;t delicious. It is &s;o highly valued at the Cape, as to &s;ell at twelve or fifteen pence the pound.

Kolbe is more exact than u&s;ual in his de&s;cription
of this animal; yet it is doubtful whether he
&s;aw it &s;o frequently as he in&s;inuates; for the fi|gure
he gives is &s;till wor&s;e than tho&s;e of Colum|na, Aldrovandus, and Pro&s;per Alpinus, which
were all drawn from &s;tuffed &s;kins. It is ea&s;y to
perceive, that the de&s;criptions and figures in
Kolbe's works have not been taken on the &s;pot,
nor drawn from nature. His de&s;criptions are
written from memory, and mo&s;t of the figures
have been copied from tho&s;e of other naturali&s;ts.
The figure he has given of the hippopotamus
has a great re&s;emblance to the cheropotamus of
Pro&s;per Alpinus<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Note. The figures of the cheropotami of Pro&s;per Alpi|nus, <HI>lib. 4. cop. 12. tab.</HI> 22. &s;eem to have been drawn from &s;tuffed &s;kins of hippopotami, from which the teeth appear to have been extracted.</NOTE>.</P>

Mo&s;t authors relate, that this animal is only
found in fre&s;h water lakes, and in rivers, &s;ome|times
near their mouths, but oftener at great
di&s;tances from the &s;ea. Some travellers are

&s;u&s;picious by the very evidence which Zerenghi
quotes. Be&s;ides, as the hippopotamus is of an
enormous &s;ize, like the elephant, the rhinoceros,
the whale, and all other large animals, it mu&s;t
produce but one at a time: This analogy &s;eems
to be more certain than the vague reports of travellers.</P>

<HEAD>Addition to the Article Hippopotamus, by Pro|fe&s;&s;or
Allamand, Editor of the Dutch Edition
of this Work.</HEAD>
<P>To complete the de&s;cription of the adult hip|popotamus
given by M de Buffon, nothing is
wanting but a genuine figure of the animal. M.
de Buffon, who is always original, cho&s;e not to
copy the figures publi&s;hed by different authors.
They are all too imperfect to be u&s;ed; and,
with regard to the animal it&s;elf, he could not
po&s;&s;ibly procure it. Even in its native country,
it is very rare, and too large to be tran&s;ported
without great expence and trouble. In the ca|binet
of natural curio&s;ities in the univer&s;ity of
Leyden, there is a &s;tuffed &s;kin of the hippopota|mus,
which had been &s;ent from the Cape of
Good Hope. Though it had been tran&s;mitted
to Holland more than a century ago, it has
been &s;o well preferred, that it &s;till exhibits an
exact repre&s;entation of the animal. It is &s;up|ported
by rings of iron, and by pieces of wood
of &s;uch &s;olidity, that drying has produced no
considerable alterations. As it is probably the
only &s;pecimen of the kind in Europe, I am per|&s;uaded
that all lovers of natural knowledge will
thank me for enriching the magnificent work of
M. de Buffon with an exact engraving of it.
The figure I have given repre&s;ents the ani|mal
<PB N="303" REF="345">
better than any that has hitherto been
drawn, or rather, it is the only figure we have
of it; for, in all the others, the hippopotamus is
not di&s;tingui&s;hable, if we except that to be found
in a Dutch book, concerning the Leviathan of
Holy Writ, which was copied from the &s;ame
model; but the proportions of the animal are
not accurately ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>It is unnece&s;&s;ary to add a de&s;cription of this
enormous animal, having no additions to what
has been &s;aid of it by M. de Buffon and M. Daubenton.</P>
<P>[As the figure of the young hippopotamus, in the
cabinet of the Prince of Cond&eacute;, differs from
that which M. Allamand had engraved from the
&s;tuffed &s;kin in the Leyden Cabinet, and as it has
a greater re&s;emblance to a new figure given by
Dr Klockner from another &s;kin in the Prince of
Orange's cabinet, I have here preferred the
latter; and I &s;hall add &s;ome remarks of the
&s;ame author, which were tran&s;lated from the

<HEAD>Addition to M. de Buffon's Hi&s;tory of the Hippo|potamus,
by Dr Klockner of Am&s;terdam.</HEAD>
<P>I am &s;urpri&s;ed that M. de Buffon takes no
notice of a pa&s;&s;age in Diodorus Siculus, concern|ing
the hippopotamus, e&s;pecially as this antient
<PB N="304" REF="346">
author remarks, that its voice re&s;embled the
neighing of a hor&s;e, which perhaps induced him
to give it the denomination of <HI>hippopotamus</HI> or
<HI>river-hor&s;e.</HI> M. de Buffon founded his opini|on
of this matter upon the te&s;timonies of an|tient
and modern authors. Diodorus Siculus
ought to have held the fir&s;t rank among the
former, &s;ince he not only travelled into Egypt,
but is ju&s;tly e&s;teemed to be one of the be&s;t hi|&s;torians of antiquity. The following are the
words of the pa&s;&s;age alluded to: &startq;The Nile pro|duces &s;everal animals, of which the crocodile
and hippopotamus merit particular attention.
&hellip;. The latter is five cubits in length. His
feet are cloven like tho&s;e of the ruminating
animals; and in each jaw he has three tu&s;ks
larger than tho&s;e of the wild boar. The
whole ma&s;s of his body re&s;embles that of the
elephant. His &s;kin is harder and &s;tronger
than, perhaps, that of any other animal. He
is amphibious, and remains, during the day,
under the water, where he moves and acts in
the &s;ame manner as if he were on land, which
he vi&s;its in the night, in order to feed on the
herbage of the mountains. If this animal were
more prolific, he would commit great deva&s;ta|tion
on the cultivated fields of Egypt. The
hunting of the hippopotamus requires a num|ber
of men, who endeavour to pierce him with
iron daggers. They attack him with &s;everal
boats joined together, and &s;trike with crooked
<PB N="305" REF="347">
harpoons. To &s;ome of the&s;e hooks they fix a
rope, and then leave the animal to exhau&s;t
him&s;elf with &s;truggling and the lo&s;s of blood.

<P>This is perhaps the be&s;t de&s;cription of the hip|popotamus to be found among the antients;

<HEAD>Ob&s;ervations on the mode of preparing the &s;kin of
the Hippopotamus, now in the Prince of
Orange's Cabinet, by Dr Klockner.</HEAD>
<P>I received from the Hague, in a very dry
&s;tate, the &s;kin of this hippopotamus, with the
head inclo&s;ed within it. The &s;kin had been
fir&s;t &s;alted, then dried, and afterwards the &s;kin
of a young hippopotamus, (which is likewi&s;e in
the Prince's cabinet) &s;teeped in brine, was, in a
moi&s;t &s;tate, put into the adult &s;kin. After which,
the whole was packed up in coar&s;e cloth, and
tran&s;mitted from the Cape of Good Hope to
Holland. The &s;mall &s;kin and the head, of
cour&s;e, produced a di&s;agreeable odour of rancid
grea&s;e, which attracted the in&s;ects, and they da|maged
the large &s;kin that was fir&s;t expo&s;ed to
their attacks.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="348">
When I diluted the head, it &s;welled greatly.
The opening of the mouth was more than &s;ix|teen
inches of Am&s;terdam mea&s;ure<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The Am&s;terdam foot is only ten inches five lines of the French foot.</NOTE>. The up|per
and under lips were &s;ufficiently large to co|ver
all the animal's teeth, e&s;pecially as the infe|rior
canine teeth are crooked, and &s;lip along the
curvature of the &s;uperior, in the form of &s;ciffars,
and pa&s;s into a &s;ocket formed by the &s;kin of the
lip and the gums. Between the cutting teeth
and the cylindrical grinders, as well as between
the tongue and cutting teeth, there is a &s;mooth
hard &s;kin; and the palate is full of notches or
hollows. The tongue had been cut out&hellip;..
The fle&s;h on each &s;ide of the head had al&s;o been
removed; and the fat which remained was cor|rupted.
The whole, however, was inter&s;per&s;ed
with very &s;trong mu&s;cles, and the fle&s;h about
the two lips was red and white, or of the colour
of an ox's tongue.</P>
<P>Immediately behind the inferior canine teeth,
there is a protuberance, which, when the mouth
is &s;hut, fills the &s;pace between the canine teeth
and grinders. This opening, though filled, has
contracted one half in drying, as well as the
lips.</P>
<P>Under the ears, and around the auditory pa&s;|&s;age,
which is remarkably &s;mall, as well as in
the orbits of the eyes, there was a great quantity
of fat.</P>
<P>The ears are placed upon an eminence, and
in &s;uch a manner as to form circular folds. The
<PB N="307" REF="349">
elevation of the right ear was much dimini&s;hed
in drying; but it was con&s;picuous in the left.</P>
<P>We know that the ears of the hippopotamus
are very &s;mall. But tho&s;e of our &s;ubject had
been con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed by in&s;ects. The
internal part of the ears is garni&s;hed with fine
clo&s;e hair; but there is very little hair on the
out&s;ide.</P>
<P>The eyes mu&s;t have been very &s;mall; for the
&s;ockets were uncommonly &s;mall in proportion to
the magnitude of the animal. The eyes I placed
in my &s;ubject are perhaps larger than nature;
but, when I u&s;ed &s;maller ones, they did not &s;eem
to corre&s;pond with the animal.</P>
<P>The no&s;trils &s;lope downward, and have a &s;mall
aperture. They are afterwards joined internally by
a &s;mall crooked line. When the &s;kin was
dry, it was difficult to perceive the&s;e tubes. I
enlarged them a little before the &s;kin was again
dried.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t here remark, that I only found thirty-two
teeth in this hippopotamus, which accords
not either with Zerenghi's or M. Daubenton's
de&s;criptions. The fir&s;t &s;ays, that he found forty-four
teeth in his &s;ubjects; and the &s;econd found
thirty-&s;ix in the head pre&s;erved in the Royal
Cabinet. This difference excited my attention:
But I could perceive no marks of teeth having
fallen out, except one of the cutting teeth, which
&s;eemed to have been broken. There are four
canine teeth placed perpendicularly, eight cut|ting
teeth, four in the upper jaw, which are per|pendicular,
<PB N="308" REF="350">
and four in the under jaw, placed
horizontally, as may be &s;een in the figure. Be|&s;ides,
I found two grinders in each &s;ide of the
under jaw, and three teeth, placed before the
grinders, which had the form of kayles. In
each &s;ide of the upper jaw, were three grinders,
and two of the&s;e cylindrical teeth. Between
the&s;e cylindrical teeth, there is a &s;pace of about
half an inch.</P>
<P>[I mu&s;t here remark, fays the Count de Buffon,
that the hippopotamus has commonly thirty-&s;ix
teeth, namely, four cutting teeth above, and four
below, and two canine teeth and twelve grinders
in each jaw. This ob&s;ervation has been verified
by three heads, which have long remained in
the Royal Cabinet, and by a fourth head, which
was tran&s;mitted to me, in the month of Decem|ber
1775, by M. de Sartine, &s;ecretary of &s;tate to
the marine department. The la&s;t grinder, at
the bottom of the mouth, is much thicker, broad|er,
and flatter on the edge, than the other five.
But I am inclined to think that the number of
grinders varies according to the age of the ani|mal;
and that, in&s;tead of twenty-four, we may
&s;ometimes find twenty-eight, and even thirty-two,
which, as Zerenghi remarks, would make
forty-four in all.]</P>
<P>The upper and under lips, continues Dr Klock|ner,
are garni&s;hed, at con&s;iderable di&s;tances, with
&s;mall tufts of hair, which, like pencils, proceed
from one tube. I counted about twenty of them.
<PB N="309" REF="351">
I examined a &s;ection of one of the&s;e tubes with
the micro&s;cope, and found &s;even roots i&s;&s;uing
from one tube. The&s;e &s;even roots afterwards
&s;plit, and each gave ri&s;e to &s;everal hairs, which
formed a kind of pencil.</P>
<P>On the &s;ides of the mouth, toward the lower
part, I &s;aw &s;ome fine hairs, which were placed
nearer each other than the former.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, I found here and there upon the body
&s;ome &s;cattered hairs; but there were none upon
the legs, flanks, or belly.</P>
<P>The extremity and edges of the tail were
garni&s;hed with pencils of hair, like the no&s;e;
but they were a little longer.</P>
<P>I could not di&s;cover the &s;ex of this animal.
Near the fundament there was a kind of train|gular
pinked aperture, about &s;ix inches wide,
where I imagined the organs of generation had
been &s;ituated; but, as no ve&s;tige of them re|mained,
it was impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain the &s;ex.</P>
<P>The &s;kin of the belly, near the hind legs, was
an inch and nine lines thick: Here the in&s;ects
had made a hole, which rendered it an ea&s;y
matter to mea&s;ure the thickne&s;s. The &s;ub&s;tance
of the &s;kin was white, cartilaginous, and coria|ceous;
and, at this place, it was well &s;eparated
from the fat and fle&s;h. Higher up, toward the
back, a good deal of the &s;kin had been pared off,
with a view, no doubt, to render it lighter for
carriage. It was for this rea&s;on that the &s;kin
<PB N="310" REF="352">
about the &s;pine exceeded not an inch in thick|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>The toes were furni&s;hed with nails. The &s;kin
between the toes was very wide; and I believe
that the feet of this animal, when alive, were
rather flat than round. The heel, which is
placed high and backward, appeared to be well
adapted for &s;wimming. The hoof, though thick
and hardened, was neverthele&s;s flexible.</P>
<P>The dimen&s;ions of this animal were nearly the
&s;ame with tho&s;e of Zerenghi's female hippopo|tamus,
formerly de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>I was told, that this hippopotamus had advan|ced
a great way upon land in the territories of
the Cape, and even near the place called the
<HI>Mountains of &s;now,</HI> when it was &s;hot by Charles
Marais, a pea&s;ant of French extraction. This
pea&s;ant brought the &s;kin to M. de Piettenberg,
Governour of the Cape, who tran&s;mitted it to his
Highne&s;s the Prince. I had the relation from
a nephew of C. Marais, who re&s;ides in Am&s;ter|dam.
According to the account given by this
man, who had it from the mouth of Marais, the
hippopotamus runs extremely &s;wift, both in
mar&s;hy places and on the firm ground. It is for
this rea&s;on that the pea&s;ants, though excellent
hunters, dare not fire upon him but when he is
in the water. They lie in wait for him about
&s;un&s;et, when the animal rai&s;es his head above
the water, and keeps his &s;mall ears in perpetual
agitation, in order to hear if any noi&s;e is near.
<PB N="311" REF="353">
When any object of prey appears upon the wa|ter,
he darts upon it like an arrow from a bow.
While the hippopotamus is li&s;tening in this
manner, and floating on the &s;urface of the wa|ter,
the hunters endeavour to &s;hoot him in the
head. The one who&s;e &s;kin I &s;tuffed was &s;hot
between the eye and the right ear; and the
young one, which is al&s;o in the Prince's cabinet,
had been &s;hot, or &s;truck with an harpoon, in the
brea&s;t, as appears from in&s;pection. When he
feels that he is wounded, he plunges below the
water, and walks or &s;wims till he lo&s;es both mo|tion
and life. Then, by means of about twenty
oxen, he is dragged on &s;hore and di&s;&s;ected. An
adult hippopotamus generally yields about two
thou&s;and pounds of fat, which is &s;alted and &s;ent
to the Cape, where it fells very dear. This fat
or lard is extremely good, and in reli&s;h excels
all others. When pre&s;&s;ed, it yields a mild oil,
as white as cream. In Africa, it is recommend|ed
as a &s;overeign remedy for di&s;ea&s;es of the
brea&s;t. The quantity of lard derived from an
individual, demon&s;trates that this animal is of a
&s;urpri&s;ing weight and magnitude.</P>
<P>Before fini&s;hing my remark, I &s;hall here add
&s;ome particulars, regarding the natural hi&s;tory
of the hippopotamus, which are not to be found
in the preceding de&s;cription.</P>
<P>We have &s;een, that the hippopotamus pro|bably
derived his name from the re&s;emblance of
his voice to the neighing of a hor&s;e. From the
<PB N="312" REF="354">
mo&s;t authentic accounts, however, it appears that
his cry has a greater &s;imilarity to that of the ele|phant,
or to the &s;tammering and indi&s;tinct &s;ounds
uttered by deaf per&s;ons. Be&s;ide this cry, the
hippopotamus, when a&s;leep, makes a kind of
&s;norting noi&s;e, which betrays him at a di&s;tance.
To prevent the danger ari&s;ing from this circum|&s;tance,
he generally lies among the reeds that
grow upon mar&s;hy grounds, and which it is diffi|cult
to approach.</P>
<P>I can no where find the remark of Marais,
concerning the agility of this animal, confirmed.
We are perpetually a&s;&s;ured, on the contrary, that
the hunters choo&s;e rather to attack him on land
than in the water, which indicates, that they are
not afraid of his &s;wiftne&s;s. According to other
hi&s;torians, his return to the river is cut off by trees
and ditches; because they know that he uni|formly
inclines to regain the water, where he
has no other animal to fear, rather than to fight
or fly upon land. The great &s;hark and the
crocodile avoid the hippopotamus, and dare not
engage with him.</P>
<P>The &s;kin of the hippopotamus is &s;o extreme|ly
hard on the back, the crupper, and the exter|nal
parts of the thighs and buttocks, that neither
arrows nor mu&s;ket balls can pierce it. But it
is &s;ofter and thinner on the in&s;ide of the thighs
and belly, where the hunters endeavour to &s;hoot
him, or to pierce him with a javelin. He is
extremely tenacious of life; and, therefore, they
<PB N="313" REF="355">
try to break his legs by large blunderbu&s;&s;es, char|ged
with iron wedges. When they &s;ucceed,
they are full ma&s;ters of the animal. The Ne|groes,
who attack the &s;harks and crocodiles
with long knives and javelins, are afraid of the
hippopotamus, and would perhaps never attempt
to combat him, unle&s;s they knew that they could
outrun him. They believe, however, that this
animal has a &s;tronger antipathy to the Whites
than to the Blacks.</P>
<P>The female brings forth on land, where &s;he
&s;uckles her young, and &s;oon teaches it to take
refuge in the water, when the &s;malle&s;t noi&s;e is
heard.</P>
<P>The Negroes of Angola, Congo, Elmina, and,
in general, of the whole we&s;t coa&s;t of Africa,
regard the hippopotamus as one of tho&s;e infe|rior
divinities which they call <HI>Fetiches.</HI> They
&s;cruple not, however, to eat his fle&s;h, when they
can procure it.</P>
<P>I am uncertain whether I &s;hould here quote
a pa&s;&s;age from P. Labat, where he &s;ays that the hippopotamus, who is of a very &s;anguiferous
temperament, knows how to let blood of him|&s;elf.
For this purpo&s;e, he remarks, the animal
&s;earches for a &s;harp-pointed rock, and rubs him|&s;elf
again&s;t it, till he makes a &s;ufficient aperture
for the blood to flow. To promote the flux, he
agitates his body; and, when he thinks he has
lo&s;t a &s;ufficient quantity, he rolls in the mud in
<PB N="314" REF="356">
order to &s;hut up the wound. In this &s;tory there
is nothing impo&s;&s;ible; but how could P. Labat
di&s;cover this &s;ingular operation?</P>
<P>Be&s;ide the u&s;es to which the &s;kin and teeth
of the hippopotamus are applied, we are a&s;&s;ured
that the Indian painters employ the blood of
this animal as one of their colours.</P>

<PB N="319" REF="362">
ob&s;cure intimations of the elk and rain-deer un|der
the appellations of <HI>alce, machlis,</HI> and <HI>tarandus.</HI>
The name <HI>alce,</HI> therefore, cannot be properly
con&s;idered as either Greek or Latin; but it ap|pears
to have been derived from the Celtic lan|guage,
in which the elk is called <HI>elch</HI> or <HI>elk.</HI>
The Latin name of the rain-deer is &s;till more
uncertain. Several naturali&s;ts have thought that it
was the <HI>machlis</HI> of Pliny; becau&s;e this author,
when &s;peaking of the northern animals, men|tions,
at the &s;ame time, the <HI>alce</HI> and the <HI>machlis;</HI>
the la&s;t of which, he remarks, is peculiar to
Scandinavia, and was never &s;een either at Rome,
or any part of the Roman empire. In Cae&s;ar's
Commentaries<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">E&s;t bos in Hercinia &s;ilva, cervi figura, cujus a media fronte inter aures unum cornu exi&s;tit excel&s;ius, magi&s;que di|rectum his quae nobis nota &s;unt cornibus: Ab ejus &s;ummo &s;icut palmae ramique late diffunduntur.

The rain-deer, in fact, has brow antlers which &s;eem to form an intermediate horn. His horns are divided into &s;everal branches, terminated by large palms; and the female has horns as well as the male. But the females of the elk, the &s;tag, the fallow-deer, and the roe-deer, have no horns. Hence it is apparent, that the animal here pointed out by Cae&s;ar, is the rain-deer, and not the elk; e&s;pecially as, in ano|ther place, he mentions the elk, under the name of <HI>alce,</HI> in the following terms: Sunt item in Hercinia &s;ilva quae appel|lantur <HI>Alces:</HI> Harum e&s;t con&s;imilis capris (<HI>capreis</HI>) figura et varietas pellium: Sed magnitudine paulo antecedunt mutilae quae &s;unt cornibus et crura &s;ine nodis articuli&s;que habent, ne|que quietis cau&s;a procumbunt.&mdash;His &s;unt arbores pro cubilibus: Ad eas &s;e applicant: Atque ita paulum modo reclinatae quietem capiunt: Quarum ex ve&s;tigiis cum e&s;t animadver&s;um a venatoribus quo &s;e recipere con&s;ueverint, omnes eo loco aut a radicibus &s;ubruunt aut ab&s;cindunt arbores tantum ut &s;umma &s;pecies earum &s;tantium relinquatur: Huc cum &s;e con&s;uetudine reclinaverint, infirmas arbores pondere affligunt atque una ip&s;ae concidunt; <HI>de bello Gallico, lib.</HI> 6.

All the re&s;t is intelligible; for the elk has very &s;tiff limbs, that is, their articulations are very firm and clo&s;e; and, as the antients believed, that there were animals, &s;uch as the elephant, which could neither bend their limbs nor lie down, it is not &s;urpri&s;ing that they attribute to the elk this fabulous &s;tory of the elephant.</NOTE>, however, we find a pa&s;&s;age, which
<PB N="320" REF="363">
can apply to no other animal than the rain-deer,
and &s;eems to prove that it then exi&s;ted in the
fore&s;ts of Germany; and Ga&s;ton Phaebus, fif|teen
centuries after Julius Cae&s;ar, &s;eems to &s;peak
of the rain-deer, under the name of <HI>rangier,</HI> as
an animal, which, in his time, exi&s;ted in the
fore&s;ts of France. He has even given a good
description<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>The <HI>rangier</HI> or <HI>ranglier</HI> is an animal that re&s;embles the &s;tag; but his horns are larger and much more branched. When hunted, he flies, on account of the great weight on his head. But, after running long, and doubling, he places his buttocks again&s;t a tree, to prevent any attack from behind, and bends his head toward the ground. In this &s;ituation, the dogs dare not approach him, becau&s;e his whole body is defended by his horns. If they come behind him, he &s;trikes them whith his heels. The grey-hounds and bull-dogs are ter|rified when they &s;ee his horns. The rangier is not taller than the fallow deer; but he is much thicker. When he rears his horns backward, they cover his whole body. He feeds like the &s;tag or fallow deer, and throws his dung in clu&s;ters. He lives very long. The hunters &s;hoot him with arrows, or take him with different kinds of &s;nares. He is fatter than a &s;tag. Like the fallow deer, he follows the &s;tag in the rutting &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>As to the manner of hunting the <HI>rangier</HI> or <HI>ranglier;</HI> when the hunters go in que&s;t of this animal, they &s;hould &s;eparate the dogs, to prevent his running into the thicke&s;t parts of the fore&s;t, which are inhabited by the fallow deer and roe|bucks. He &s;hould &s;pread his nets and &s;nares according to the &s;ituation of the fore&s;t, and lead his hounds through the wood. As the horns of the rangier are high and heavy, few hunters attempt to &s;eize him with hounds; <HI>La Veneric de Jacques Du|fouilloux, p.</HI> 97.</P></NOTE> of this animal, and of the manner
<PB N="321" REF="364">
of hunting him. As his de&s;cription cannot ap|ply
to the elk, and as he gives, at the &s;ame time,
the mode of hunting the &s;tag, the fallow deer,
the roebuck, the wild goat, the chamois goat,
&amp;c. it cannot be alledged, that, under the article
<HI>rangier,</HI> he meant any of the&s;e animals, or that
he had been deceived in the application of the
name. It is apparent, therefore, from the&s;e po&s;i|tive
evidences, that the rain-deer formerly exi&s;ted
in France, e&s;pecially in the mountainous parts,
&s;uch as the Pyrennees, in the neighbourhood of
which Ga&s;ton Phaebus re&s;ided, as Lord of the coun|ty
of Foix; and that, &s;ince this period, they have
been de&s;troyed, like the &s;tags, which were formerly
<PB N="322" REF="365">
common in this country, and which now exi&s;t
not in Bigore, Cou&s;erans, nor in the adjacent
provinces. It is certain that the rain-deer is
found only in more northern latitudes. But we
likewi&s;e know, that the climate of France was
formerly much moi&s;ter and colder, on account
of the many fore&s;ts and mar&s;hes which have
&s;ince been cut down and drained. From the
Emperor Julian's letter, we learn what was the
rigour of the fro&s;t at Paris in his time. The
de&s;cription he gives of the ice on the Seine is
perfectly the &s;ame with what the Canadians tell
us of the ice in the rivers of Quebec. Gaul,
under the &s;ame latitude with Canada, was, two
thou&s;and years ago, exactly what Canada is at
pre&s;ent, namely, a climate &s;ufficiently cold to
nouri&s;h animals which are now found only in
the more northern regions.</P>
<P>From all the&s;e facts, therefore, it is evident,
that the elk and the rain-deer formerly exi&s;ted
in the fore&s;ts of Gaul and Germany; and that
the pa&s;&s;ages in the Commentaries of Cae&s;ar can
apply to no other animals. In proportion as
the lands were cleared, and the waters dried up,
the temperature of the climate would become
more mild, the&s;e animals, who delight in cold,
would fir&s;t abandon the flat countries, and retire
to the &s;nowy mountains, where they &s;till &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted
in the days of Ga&s;ton de Foix. The rea|&s;on
why they are no longer found there is ob|vious: The heat of the climate has been gra|dually
<PB N="323" REF="366">
augmented by the almo&s;t total de&s;truction
of the fore&s;ts, by the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive lowering of the
mountains, by the diminution of the waters, by
the multiplication of the human race, and by
culture and improvement of every kind. It ap|pears
likewi&s;e, that Pliny has borrowed from
Cae&s;ar almo&s;t every thing he has &s;aid of the&s;e
two animals, and that he was the fir&s;t who in|troduced
confu&s;ion into their names. The <HI>alce</HI>
and the <HI>machlis</HI> he mentions at the &s;ame time;
from which we are led to conclude that the&s;e
two names denote two different animals<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Several of our mo&s;t learned naturali&s;ts, and particularly Mr Ray, have thought that the <HI>machlis,</HI> being placed &s;o near the <HI>alce,</HI> could be no other than the rain-deer. <HI>Cervus rangifer, the rain-deer; Plinio machlis; Raii &s;ynop&s;. quad. p.</HI> 88.

if we con&s;ider, 1. That he mentions the <HI>alce</HI> on|ly
once, without giving any de&s;cription of it;
2. That he alone employs the word <HI>machlis,</HI>
which is neither Greek nor Latin, but &s;eems to

have been corrupted, and tho&s;e two names mu&s;t
denote the &s;ame animal, namely the <HI>elk.</HI> The
deci&s;ion of this que&s;tion will re&s;olve another.
As the <HI>machlis</HI> is the <HI>elk,</HI> the <HI>tarandus</HI> mu&s;t be
the <HI>rain-deer.</HI> The name <HI>tarandus</HI> is found in
no other author before Pliny, and has given
ri&s;e to various interpretations. Agricola and
Elliot, however, have not he&s;itated to apply it to
the rain-deer; and, for the rea&s;on above a&s;&s;ign|ed,
we willingly &s;ub&s;cribe to their opinion. Be|&s;ides,
we &s;hould not be &s;urpri&s;ed at the &s;ilence
of the Greeks, nor at the ambiguity with which
the Latins have mentioned the&s;e animals; &s;ince
the northern regions were ab&s;olutely unknown
to the former, and the latter had all their in|formation
concerning them from the relations
of others.</P>
<P>Now, in Europe and A&s;ia, the elk is found
only on this &s;ide, and the rain-deer beyond the
Polar circle. In America, we meet with them
in lower latitudes; becau&s;e there the cold is
greater than in Europe. The rain-deer, being
able to endure the mo&s;t exce&s;&s;ive cold, is found
in Spitzbergen<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In every part of Spitzbergen, the rain-deer are found, but particularly in <HI>Rehen-feld,</HI> a place which received its name from the number of rain-deer it produces.

Both the&s;e authors, in their de&s;criptions, mention, as a peculiar character, the down with which the horns of the&s;e animals were covered. This character, however, is common to the rain-deer, the ftag, the fallow deer, and all the deer kind. This hair or down countinues on the horns during the &s;ummer-&s;ea&s;on, which is the time when they are growing, and the only time that ve&s;|&s;els can &s;ail to Greenland, It is not, therefore, &s;urpri&s;ing that, during this &s;ea&s;on, the horns of the rain-deer &s;hould be covered with down.

&s;tag; and both may be tamed; but the rain-deer
is more ea&s;ily tamed than the elk. The
latter, like the &s;tag, has never lo&s;t its liberty.
But the rain-deer has been rendered dome&s;tic by
the mo&s;t &s;tupid of the human race. The Lap|landers
have no other cattle. In this frozen
climate, which receives only the mo&s;t oblique
rays of the &s;un, where the night and the day
con&s;titute two &s;ea&s;ons, where the earth is cover|ed
with &s;now from the beginning of autumn to
the end of &s;pring, where the bramble, the juni|per,
and the mo&s;s, con&s;titute the only verdure of
the &s;ummer, man can never hope to nouri&s;h
cattle. The hor&s;e, the ox, the &s;heep, and all
our other u&s;eful animals, could never find &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence
<PB N="331" REF="374">
there, nor be able to re&s;i&s;t the rigours of
the fro&s;t. It would have been nece&s;&s;ary to &s;e|lect
from the deepe&s;t fore&s;ts tho&s;e &s;pecies of ani|mals
which are lea&s;t wild and mo&s;t profitable.
The Laplanders have actually done what we
would be obliged to do, if all our cattle were
de&s;troyed. To &s;upply their place, it would then
be nece&s;&s;ary to tame the &s;tags and roebucks of
our woods, and to render them dome&s;tic. This
end, I am per&s;uaded, might be ea&s;ily accompli&s;h|ed
and we would &s;oon derive as much benefit
from the&s;e animals, as the Laplanders do from
their rain-deer. This example &s;hould lead us
to admire the unbounded liberality of Nature.
We u&s;e not one half of the trea&s;ures &s;he pre&s;ents
to us; for her re&s;ources are inexhau&s;tible. She
has given us the hor&s;e, the ox, the &s;heep, and
other dome&s;tic animals, to &s;erve, to nouri&s;h, and
to clothe us; and &s;he has other &s;pecies &s;till in
re&s;erve, which might &s;upply the want of the
former: The&s;e we have only to &s;ubdue, and to
render them &s;ub&s;ervient to our purpo&s;es. Man
is equally ignorant of the powers of Nature, and
of his own capacity to modify and improve her
productions. In&s;tead of making new re&s;earches,
he is continually abu&s;ing the little knowledge
he has acquired.</P>
<P>By e&s;timating the advantages the Laplanders
derive from the rain-deer, we &s;hall find that this
animal is worth two or three of our dome&s;tic
animals. They u&s;e him as a hor&s;e in drawing
<PB N="332" REF="375">
&s;ledges and carriages. He is &s;o nimble and ex|peditious,
that in one day he performs with ea&s;e
a journey of thirty leagues, and runs with equal
&s;urene&s;s on the frozen &s;nows as upon the fine&s;t
downs. The milk of the female affords a more
&s;ub&s;tantial nouri&s;hment than that of the cow.
The fle&s;h of this animal is exceedingly good.
His hair makes excellent furs; and his &s;kin is
convertible into a very &s;trong and pliant leather.
Thus the rain-deer alone furni&s;hes every article
we derive from the hor&s;e, the ox, and the &s;heep.</P>
<P>The manner in which the Laplanders rear
and manage the rain-deer, merits particular at|tention.

&s;inking. &hellip;&hellip; The&s;e animals are extremely
gentle, and are kept in flocks, which bring great
profits to their owners. The milk, the &s;kin, the
&s;inews, the bones, the hoofs, the horns, the hair,
the fle&s;h, are all u&s;eful articles. The riche&s;t
Laplanders have flocks of four or five hundred;
and the poore&s;t have ten or twelve. They are
led out to pa&s;ture, and, during the night, they
are &s;hut up in inclo&s;ures, to protect them from
the wolves. When carried to another climate,
they &s;oon die. Steno Prince of Sweden &s;ent
&s;ome of them to Frederic Duke of Hol&s;tein;
and, more recently, in the year 1533, Gu&s;tavus
King of Sweden tran&s;mitted to Pru&s;&s;ia ten male
and female rain-deer, which were let loo&s;e in the
woods. They all peri&s;hed without producing,
either in the dome&s;tic or free &s;tate. &startq;I had
a great de&s;ire,&endq; &s;ays M. Regnard, &startq;to carry &s;ome
live rain-deer to France. This experiment
has been frequently tried in vain. La&s;t year,
&s;ome of them were brought to Dantzick,
where, being unable to endure the heat of that
climate, they peri&s;hed.&endq;</P>
<P>In Lapland there are both wild and dome&s;tic
rain-deer. During the rutting &s;ea&s;on, the fe|males
are let loo&s;e into the woods, where they
meet with wild males; and, as the latter are
&s;tronger and more hardy than the dome&s;tic kind,
the breed from this commixture is better adapt|ed
for drawing &s;ledges. The&s;e rain-deer are
not &s;o mild as the others; for they &s;ometimes
<PB N="334" REF="377">
not only refu&s;e to obey their ma&s;ter, but turn
again&s;t him, and &s;trike him &s;o furiou&s;ly with
their feet, that his only re&s;ource is to cover him|&s;elf
with his &s;ledge, till the rage of the animal
abates. This carriage is &s;o light, that a Lap|lander
can turn it with ea&s;e-above him&s;elf. The
bottom of it is covered with the &s;kins of young
rain-deer, the hair of which is turned backward,
to make the &s;ledge advance ea&s;ily up the moun|tains,
and prevent its recoiling. The rain-deer
is yoked by means of a collar, made of a piece
of &s;kin with the hair on it, from which a trace is
brought under the belly between the legs, and
fixed to the fore part of the &s;ledge. The only
rein u&s;ed by the Laplander is a cord tied to the
root of the animal's horn, which he &s;ometimes
lays upon the one &s;ide of its back, and &s;ometimes
on the other, according as he wants it to turn to
the right or the left. The rain-deer can travel,
in this manner, at the rate of four or five leagues
in an hour. But the quicker he goes, the mo|tion
becomes the more incommodious; and it
requires much practice to be able to &s;it in the
&s;ledge, and to prevent it from over-turning.</P>
<P>Externally, the rain-deer have many things
in common with the &s;tag; and the &s;tructure of
their internal parts is nearly the &s;ame<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vide Rangifer. anatom. Barth. Act. 1671. No. 135.</NOTE>. From
this natural conformity, many analogous habits
and &s;imilar effects re&s;ult. Like the &s;tag, the
rain-deer annually ca&s;ts his horns, and is loaded
<PB N="335" REF="378">
with fat. The rutting &s;ea&s;on of both is about
the end of September. The females of both &s;pe|cies
go eight months with young, and pro|duce
but one fawn. During the rutting &s;ea&s;on,
the males have an equally di&s;agreeable odour;
and &s;ome of the female rain-deer, as well as the
hinds, are barren<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Out of a hundred females, not above ten are barren, and, on account of their &s;terility, are called <HI>raones.</HI> The fle&s;h of the&s;e is very fat and &s;ucculent in autumn; <HI>Scheffer, p.</HI> 204.</NOTE>. The young rain-deer, like
the fawns of the &s;tag, are variou&s;ly coloured, be|ting
fir&s;t red mixed with yellow, and afterwards
become of a blacki&s;h brown colour<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The colour of their hair is blacker than that of the &s;tag&hellip;. The wild rain-deer are always &s;tronger, larger, and blacker than the dome&s;tic kind; <HI>Regnard, tom. 1. p.</HI> 108.</NOTE>. The
young follow their mothers two or three years;
and they acquire not their full growth till the
end of the fourth year. It is at this age al&s;o that
they are trained to labour. At the age of one
year, they are ca&s;trated in order to make them
tractable. The Laplanders perform this opera|tion
with their teeth. The unca&s;trated males
are fierce, and very difficult to manage; and,
therefore, are not u&s;ed for labour. To draw
their &s;ledges, the mo&s;t active and nimble geld|ings
are &s;elected, and the heavie&s;t are employed
in carrying provi&s;ions and baggage. One un|mutilated
male is kept for every five or &s;ix fe|males.
Like the &s;tags, they are tormented with
worms, in the bad &s;ea&s;on. About the end of
winter, &s;uch va&s;t numbers are engendered under
<PB N="336" REF="379">
their &s;kin, that it is as full of holes as a &s;ieve.
The&s;e holes made by the worms clo&s;e in &s;um|mer;
and it is only in autumn that the rain-deer
are killed for their fur or their hide.</P>
<P>The flocks of rain-deer require much atten|tion.
They are apt to run off, and to a&s;&s;ume
their natural liberty. They mu&s;t he followed
and narrowly watched, and never allowed to
pa&s;ture but in open places. When the flock
is numerous, the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;everal per&s;ons is
nece&s;&s;ary to keep them together, and to pur&s;ue
tho&s;e which run off. In order to di&s;tingui&s;h
them, when they wander into the woods, or
mingle with other flocks, they are all marked.
In fine, the time of the Laplanders is totally
con&s;umed in the management of their rain-deer,
which con&s;titute their whole riches, and they
know how to derive all the conveniences, or ra|ther
the nece&s;&s;ities of life from the&s;e animals.
They are covered from head to foot with their
furs, which is impenetrable either by cold or
water. This is their winter habit. In &s;ummer,
they u&s;e the &s;kins from which the hair is fallen
off. They likewi&s;e &s;pin the hair, and cover the
&s;inews they extract from the animal's body with
it. The&s;e &s;inews &s;erve them fore ropes and
thread. They eat the fle&s;h, and drink the milk,
of which la&s;t they al&s;o make very fat chee&s;e.
The milk, when churned, in&s;tead of butter, pro|duces
a kind of &s;uet. This &s;ingularity, as well
as the great extent of the horns, and the fatne&s;s of
<PB N="337" REF="380">
the animal at the commencement of the rutting
&s;ea&s;on, are &s;trong indications of a redundance of
nouri&s;hment. But we have &s;till farther proofs
that this redundance is exce&s;&s;ive, or at lea&s;t
greater than in any other &s;pecies; for it is pecu|liar
to the rain-deer alone, that the female has
horns as well as the male, and that, even when
the males are ca&s;trated, they annually &s;hed; and
renew their horns<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Uterque &s;exus cornibus e&s;t.&mdash;Ca&s;tratus quotannis cornua deponit; <HI>Linn. &s;y&s;t. nat. p.</HI> 93. It is upon the autho|rity of Linnaeus alone that I have advanced this fact, of which I am unwilling to doubt; becau&s;e, being a native of Sweden, and having travelled into Lapland, he had an op|portunity of being well informed in every article regarding the rain-deer. I acknowledge, however, that the exception is &s;ingular, as in all other animals of the deer-kind, ca&s;tration prevents the renewal of the horns. Be&s;ides, a po&s;itive te&s;ti|mony may be oppo&s;ed to Linnaeus. <HI>Ca&s;tratis rangifetris Lap|pones utuntur. Cornua ca&s;tratorum non dicidunt, el cum hir&s;uta &s;unt, &s;emper pilis luxuriant;</HI> Hulden, Rangifer. Jenae 1697. But Hulden, perhaps, advances this fa&s;t from analogy on|ly; and the authority of &s;uch a &s;killful naturali&s;t as Linnaeus is of more weight than the te&s;timonies of many people who are le&s;s informed. The known fact, that the female has horns like the male, is another exception which gives &s;upport to the fir&s;t; and it is &s;till further &s;upported by the practice a|mong the Laplanders of not cutting away the te&s;ticles, but only compre&s;&s;ing the &s;eminal ve&s;&s;els with their teeth; for, in this ca&s;e, the action of the te&s;ticles, which &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to the production of horns, is not totally destroyed, but only weakened.</NOTE>. In the &s;tag, the fallow-deer,
and the roebuck, who have undergone this opera|tion,
the horns remain always in the &s;ame condition
they were at the time of ca&s;tration. Thus, of all
other animals, the rain-deer affords the mo&s;t con|&s;picuous
<PB N="338" REF="381">
example of redundant nutritive matter;
and this effect is perhaps le&s;s owing to the na|ture
of the animal than to the quality of his
food<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See article <HI>Stag,</HI> vol. IV.</NOTE>; for the &s;ub&s;tance of the <HI>lichen,</HI> or rain-deer
liverwort, which is its only nouri&s;ment,
e&s;pecially during the winter, is &s;imilar to that of
the mu&s;hroom, very nouri&s;hing, and contains a
greater number of organic particles than the
leaves or buds of trees<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It is remarkable that, though the rain-deer eats nothing, during winter, but great quantities of this mo&s;s, he always fattens better, his &s;kin is cleaner, and his hair finer than when he feeds upon the be&s;t herbage, at which time they make a hide|ous appearance. Their being unable to enduce heat is the rea&s;on why they are better and fatter in autumn and winter, than in &s;ummer, when they have nothing but &s;inews, &s;kin, and bone; <HI>Scheffer, hi&s;t, de la Lapponie, p,</HI> 206.</NOTE>. This is the rea&s;on
why the rain-deer has larger horns and a great|er
quantity of fat than the &s;tag, and why the fe|males
and geldings are not deprived of horns: It
is al&s;o the rea&s;on why the horns of the rain-deer
are more diver&s;ified in &s;ize, figure, and number
of branches, than any other of the deer kind.
Tho&s;e males who have never been hunted or
re&s;trained, and who feed plentifully, and at their
ea&s;e, upon this &s;ub&s;tantial nouri&s;hment, have
prodigious horns, which extend backward as
far as their crupper, and forward beyond the
muzzle. The horns of the ca&s;trated males,
though &s;maller, often exceed tho&s;e of the &s;tag;
and tho&s;e of the females are &s;till &s;maller. Thus the
<PB N="339" REF="382">
horns of the rain-deer are not only &s;ubject to
variation from age, like others of the deer-kind,
but from &s;ex and ca&s;tration. The&s;e differences
are &s;o great, in the horns of different individuals,
that it is not &s;urpri&s;ing to &s;ee the de&s;criptions
given of them by authors &s;o exceedingly different.</P>
<P>Another &s;ingularity, which is common to the
rain-deer and the elk, mu&s;t not be omitted.
When the&s;e animals run, though not at full
&s;peed, their hoofs<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Rangiferum culex pipiens, oe&s;trus tarandi, tabanus, tarandi ad alpes cogunt, crepitantibus ungulis; <HI>Linn. &s;y&s;t. nat. p.</HI> 93.&mdash;The feet of the rain-deer are &s;horter and much broader than tho&s;e of the &s;tag, and re&s;emble the feet of the buffalo. The hoofs are cloven and almo&s;t round, like tho&s;e of the ox. Whether he runs or goes &s;lowly, the joints of his limbs make a great noi&s;e, like flints falling on each other, or like the breaking of nuts. This noi&s;e is heard as far as the animal can be &s;een; <HI>Scheffer, p.</HI> 202.&mdash;Fragor ac &s;trepitus pe|dum, ungularumque tantus e&s;t in celeri progre&s;&s;u, ac &s;i &s;ilices vel nuces collidantur; qualem &s;trepitum articulorum etiam in alce ob&s;ervavi.&mdash;It is remarkable in the rain-deer, that all his bones, and particularly tho&s;e of his feet, make a crackling noi&s;e, which is &s;o loud as to be heard as far as the animal can be &s;een; <HI>Regnard, tom. 1. p.</HI> 108.</NOTE>, at each movement, make
a crackling noi&s;e, as if all their limbs were di&s;|jointed.
The wolves, adverti&s;ed by this noi&s;e,
or by the odour of the animal, throw them&s;elves
in his way, and, if numerous, they &s;eize and
kill him; for a rain-deer defends him&s;elf again&s;t
the attacks of a &s;ingle wolf. For this purpo&s;e
he employs not his horns, which are more hurt|ful
than ufeful to him, but his fore-feet, which
are very &s;trong. With the&s;e he &s;trikes the wolf
<PB N="340" REF="383">
&s;o violently as to &s;tun him, or make him fly off;
and afterwards runs with a rapidity that pre|vents
all farther attacks. The <HI>ro&s;omack</HI> or <HI>glut|ton,</HI>
though not &s;o numerous, is a more dange|rous
enemy. This animal is &s;till more voraci|ous,
but not &s;o nimble as the wolf. He pur&s;ues
not the rain-deer, but lies in wait for it conceal|ed
in a tree. As &s;oon as the rain-deer comes
within his reach, he darts down upon it, fixes
upon its back with his claws; and, tearing its
head or neck with his teeth, he never quits his
&s;tation till he has cut the animal's throat. He
employs the &s;ame artifices, and carries on the
&s;ame war again&s;t the elk, which is &s;till &s;tronger
than the rain-deer<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">There is another animal, of a grayi&s;h brown colour, and about the &s;ize of a dog, which carries on a bloody war a|gain&s;t the rain-deer.

remarkable, that this animal, which is not larger
than a badger, &s;hould kill the elk, which exceeds

was nearly of the &s;ize of a &s;tag. The length
of the body was five feet and a half from
the end of the muzzle to the origin of the
tail, which was only two inches long. Be|ing
a female, it had no horns; and its neck
was only nine inches in length, and as much
in breadth. The ears were nine inches long
by four broad&hellip;.. The colour of the hair
was not much different from that of the a&s;s,
the gray colour of which &s;ometimes approaches
to that of the camel&hellip;..In other re&s;pects,
this hair differed greatly from that of the a&s;s,
which is &s;horter, and from that of the camel,
which is much finer. The length of the hair
was three inches, and equalled in thickne&s;s
the coar&s;e&s;t hair of a hor&s;e. This thickne&s;s
dimini&s;hed gradually toward the extremity,
which was very &s;harp: It dimini&s;hed like|wi&s;e
toward the root, but &s;uddenly became
like the handle of a lancet. This handle was
of a different colour from the re&s;t of the hair,
being white and diaphanous, like the bri&s;tles
of a hog&hellip;..The hair was as long as that
of a bear, but &s;traighter, thicker, &s;moother,
and all of the &s;ame kind. The upper lip was
large and detached from the gums, but by no
means &s;o large as Solinus de&s;cribed it, nor as
Pliny has repre&s;ented the animal he calls
<HI>machlis.</HI> The&s;e authors tell us, that this crea|ture
is obliged to go backward when he pa&s;|tures,
to prevent his lip from being entangled
<PB N="346" REF="389">
between his teeth. We remarked, in the di&s;|&s;ection,
that Nature had provided again&s;t this
inconveniency by the largene&s;s and &s;trength
of the mu&s;cles de&s;tined to rai&s;e the upper lip.
We likewi&s;e found the articulations of the legs
clo&s;ely embraced by ligaments, the hardne&s;s
and thickne&s;s of which might give ri&s;e to the
opinion, that the <HI>alce,</HI> after lying down, was
unable to rai&s;e him&s;elf&hellip;. His feet were
&s;imilar to tho&s;e of the &s;tag; only they were
larger, and had no other peculiarity&hellip;&hellip;.
We remarked, that the large angle of the eye
was much more &s;lit below than in the &s;tag,
the fallow deer, and the roebuck: It is &s;in|gular,
that this &s;lit was not in the direction
of the opening of the eye, but made an angle
with the line which goes from the one corner
of the eye to the other; the inferior lachrymal
gland was an inch and a half long, by &s;even
lines broad&hellip;&hellip;.. In the brain we found
a part who&s;e magnitude &s;eemed to point out
&s;ome relation to the &s;en&s;e of &s;melling, which,
according to Pau&s;anias, is more exqui&s;ite in the
elk than in any other animal; for the olfac|tory
nerves, commonly called the <HI>mammillary
proce&s;&s;es,</HI> were incomparably larger than in any
other animal we ever di&s;&s;ected, being
more than four lines in diameter&hellip;&hellip; With
regard to the lump of fle&s;h which &s;ome au|thors
have placed on his back, and others un|der
his chin, if they have not been deceived
<PB N="347" REF="390">
or too credulous, it mu&s;t be peculiar to the elks
they mention.&endq; We can add our te&s;timony
to that of the gentlemen of the Academy; for,
in the female elk we had alive, there was no
bunch either under the chin, or on the neck.
Linnaeus, however, as he lives in the country
inhabited by elks, and ought to have a more com|plete
knowledge of them than we can pretend to,
mentions this bunch on the neck, and even
makes it an e&s;&s;ential character of the elk: <HI>Alces,
cervus cornibus acaulibus palmatis, caruncula gut|turali;
Linn. Sy&s;t. Nat. p.</HI> 92. There is no o|ther
method of reconciling the a&s;&s;ertion of Lin|naeus
with our negative evidence, but by &s;up|po&s;ing
this bunch, <HI>guttural caruncle,</HI> to be pecu|liar
to the male, which we have never &s;een.
But, though this were the ca&s;e, Linnaeus ought
not to have made it an e&s;&s;ential character of the
&s;pecies, &s;ince it exi&s;ts not in the female. This
bunch may likewi&s;e be a di&s;ea&s;e, a kind of wen,
common among the elks; for, in Ge&s;ner's<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Ge&s;ner, hi&s;t. quad. p. 1. &amp; 3.</NOTE>
two figures of this animal, the fir&s;t, which wants
horns, has a large fle&s;hy bunch on the throat;
and, in the &s;econd, which repre&s;ents a male with
his horns, there is no bunch.</P>
<P>In general, the elk is much larger arid &s;tron|ger
than the &s;tag or rain-deer<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The elk exceeds the rain-deer in magnitude, being equal to the large&s;t hor&s;e. Be&s;ides, the horns of the elk are much &s;horter, about two palms broad, and have very few branches. His feet, e&s;pecially tho&s;e before, are not round, but long, and he &s;trikes with them &s;o furiou&s;ly as to kill both men and dogs. Neither does he more re&s;emable the rain-deer in the form of his head, which is longer, and his lips are large and pendu|lous. His colour is not &s;o white as that of the rain-deer, but, over the whole body, it is an ob&s;cure yellow, mixed with a cinereous gray. When he moves, he makes no noi&s;e with his joints, which is common to all rain-deer. In fine, whoever ex|amines both animals, as I have often done, will remark &s;o many differences, that he will have rea&s;on to be &s;urpri&s;ed how any man &s;hould regard them as the &s;ame &s;pecies; <HI>Scheffer, p.</HI> 310.</NOTE>. His hair is &s;o
<PB N="348" REF="391">

&s;trength, that, with the &s;ingle blow of his fore|feet,
he can &s;lay a man, or a wolf, and even
break a tree. He is hunted, however, by men
and dogs, in the &s;ame manner as the &s;tag. We
are a&s;&s;ured, that, when pur&s;ued, he often falls
down &s;uddenly<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">We had not advanced a pi&s;tol-&s;hot into the wood, when we de&s;cried an elk, which, when running before us, &s;uddenly dropped down, without being &s;o much as fired at. We a&s;ked our guide and interpreter how the animal came to fall in this manner. He replied, that it was the falling &s;ickne&s;s, to which the&s;e animals are &s;ubject, and a&s;&s;igned that as the rea|&s;on of their being named <HI>ellends,</HI> which &s;ignifies <HI>mi&s;erable</HI>&hellip; If this di&s;ea&s;e did not often bring them down, it would be difficult to &s;eize them. The Norwegian gentleman killed this elk while it was under the influence of its di&s;ea&s;e. We pur&s;ued another two hours, and would never have taken him, if he had not, like the fir&s;t, fallen down, after having killed three &s;trong dogs with his fore-feet&hellip;. This gentleman pre&s;ent|ed me with the left hind feet of the elks he had killed, and told me they were a &s;overeign remedy again&s;t the falling &s;ick|ne&s;s. To which I an&s;wered, &s;miling, that, &s;ince this foot had &s;o much virtue, I was &s;urpri&s;ed that the animal to which it belonged &s;hould ever be afflicted with the di&s;ea&s;e. The gentle|man likewi&s;e laughed, and &s;aid that I was right; that he had &s;een it administered without effect to many people who were troubled with the epilep&s;y; and that he knew, as well as I did, that it was a vulgar error; <HI>Voyage de la Martiniere, p.</HI> 10.</NOTE>, without being either &s;hot or
<PB N="349" REF="392">
wounded. From this circum&s;tance it has been
pre&s;umed that the animal is &s;ubject to the epi|lep&s;y;
and from this pre&s;umption (which is not
well founded, &s;ince fear might produce the &s;ame
effect) the ab&s;urd conclu&s;ion has been drawn,
that his hoofs have the power of curing, and
even preventing, the falling &s;ickne&s;s. This gro&s;s
prejudice has been &s;o generally diffu&s;ed, that
many people &s;till carry pieces of the elk's hoof
in the collets of their rings.</P>
<P>As the northern parts of America are very thinly
inhabited, all the animals, and particularly the
elks, are more numerous there than in the North
of Europe. The Savages are not ignorant of the
art of hunting and &s;eizing the elks<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">De&s;cript. de I'Amerique, par Denys, tom. 2. p. 425.</NOTE>. They &s;ome|times
follow the tract of the&s;e animals for &s;eve|ral
days, and, by mere per&s;everance and addre&s;s,
accompli&s;h their purpo&s;e. Their mode of hunting
in winter is particularly &s;ingular. &startq;They u&s;e,&endq;
&s;ays Denys, &startq;rackets, by means of which they
walk on the &s;now without &s;inking&hellip;. The
orignal does not make much way, becau&s;e he
&s;inks in the &s;now, which fatigues him. He
<PB N="350" REF="393">
eats only the annual &s;hoots of trees. Where
the Savages find the wood eaten in this man|ner,
they &s;oon meet with the animals, which
are never very di&s;tant, and are ea&s;ily taken,
becau&s;e they cannot run expeditiou&s;ly. They
throw darts at them, which con&s;i&s;t of large
&s;taves, pointed with a bone, which pierces like
a &s;word. When there are many orignals in a
flock, the Savages put them to flight. The
orignals, in this ca&s;e, march at one another's
tails, and make a circle &s;ometimes of more
than two leagues, and, by their frequent turn|ing
round, tread the &s;now &s;o hard, that they
no longer &s;ink in it. The Savages lie in am|bu&s;cade,
and kill the animals with darts as they
pa&s;s.&endq; From comparing this relation with tho&s;e
already quoted, it is apparent, that the American
Savage and the orignal are exact copies of the
European Laplander and the elk.</P>

<HEAD>Addition to the article Elk and Rain-deer, by
Profe&s;&s;or Allamand.</HEAD>
<P>M. de Buffon is of opinion, that the European
elk is likewi&s;e found in North America under
the appellation of <HI>Orignal.</HI> If any difference
exi&s;ts, it con&s;i&s;ts in magnitude only, which va|ries
<PB N="351" REF="394">
in proportion to climate and food. It is
not even a&s;certained which of them are large&s;t.
M. de Buffon thinks that tho&s;e of Europe are
larger than tho&s;e of America, becau&s;e all the
animals of the New Continent are &s;maller than
tho&s;e of the Old. Mo&s;t voyagers, however, re|pre&s;ent
the orignal as exceeding the elk in mag|nitude.
Mr Dudley, who &s;ent an accurate de|&s;cription
of an original to the Royal Society,
&s;ays, that the hunters killed one which was more
than ten feet high<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Phil. Tran&s;. ann. 1721. No. 368. p. 165.</NOTE>. This &s;tature would be
nece&s;&s;ary to enable the animal to carry its enor|mous
horns, which weigh one hundred and fifty,
and, if we believe La Hontan, three or four
hundred pounds.</P>
<P>The Duke of Richmond, who delights in col|lecting,
for public utility, every thing that can
contribute to improve the arts, or augment our
knowledge of Nature, has a female original in
one of his parks, which was conveyed to him
by General Carleton, Governour of Canada, in
the year 1766. It was then only one year old,
and it lived nine or ten months. Some time be|fore
it died, he cau&s;ed an exact drawing of it to
be made, which he obligingly &s;ent to me, and of
which I have given an engraving as a &s;upple|ment
to M. de Buffon's work. As this female
was very young, it exceeded not five feet in
height. The colour of the upper part of the
body was a deep brown, and that of the under
part was brighter.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="395">
I received from Canada the head of a female
orignal which was more advanced in years. Its
length, from the end of the muzzle to the ears,
is two feet three inches. Its circumference at
the ears is two feet eight inches, and, near the
mouth, one foot ten inches. The ears are nine
inches long. But, as this head is dried, the&s;e
dimen&s;ons mu&s;t be &s;maller than when the ani|mal
was alive.</P>
<P>M. de Buffon is likewi&s;e of opinion, that the
caribou of America is the rain-deer of Lapland;
and the rea&s;ons with which he &s;upports this idea
have much weight. I have given a figure of
the rain-deer, which is wanting in the Paris edi|tion.
It is a copy of that which was publi&s;hed
by Ridinger, a famous painter and engraver,
who drew it from the life. I have likewi&s;e been
obliged to the Duke of Richmond for a drawing
of the American caribou. This animal was
&s;ent to him from Canada, and it lived a long
time in his park. His horns were only begin|ning
to &s;hoot when the figure was drawn; and
it is the only true repre&s;entation we have of the
animal. By comparing it with the rain-deer,
there appears, at fir&s;t &s;ight, to be a very con&s;i|derable
difference between the two figures; but
the want of horns in the caribou greatly changes
its a&s;pect.</P>

<PB N="353" REF="396">
<HEAD>Addition by the Count de Buffon.</HEAD>
<P>I here give an engraving of a female rain-deer,
drawn from a living female in the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
of the Prince of Cond&eacute;. It was &s;ent to
him by the King of Sweden, along with two
males, one of which died on the road, and the
other lived only a &s;hort time after its arrival in
France. The female re&s;i&s;ted the effects of the
climate for a con&s;iderable time. She was of the
&s;ize of a hind; but her legs were &s;horter and
her body thicker. Her horns, like tho&s;e of the
the male, were divided into antlers, &s;ome of
which pointed forward, and others backward.
But they were &s;horter than tho&s;e of the males.
The following de&s;criptiqn of this animal was
communicated to me by M. de S&egrave;ve.</P>
<P>&startq;The length of the whole body, from the
muzzle to the anus, in a &s;uperficial line, is five
feet one inch. The height of the withers is
two feet eleven inches, and that of the crup|per
two feet eleven inches nine lines. The
hair is thick and clo&s;e, like that of the &s;tag,
the &s;horte&s;t on the body being an inch and
three lines in length. It is longer on the belly,
very &s;hort on the limbs, and very long about
the fetlock. The colour of the hair which
covers the body is a reddi&s;h brown, more or
<PB N="354" REF="397">
le&s;s deep in different parts, and &s;prinkled with
a kind of yellowi&s;h white. Upon part of the
back, the thighs, the top of the head, and
chanfrin, the hair is deeper coloured, e&s;pec|ially
above the eye-pits, which the rain-deer
has as well as the &s;tag. The circumference
of the eye is black. The muzzle is a deep
brown, and the circumference of the no&s;trils
is black. The point of the muzzle, as far as
the no&s;trils, as well as the end of the under
jaw, are of a bright white colour. The ear is
covered above with thick white hair, approach|ing
to yellow, and mixed with brown. The
in&s;ide of the ear is adorned with large white
hairs. The neck and upper part of the body,
as well as the large hairs which hang on the
brea&s;t below the neck, are of a yellowi&s;h
white colour. Upon the &s;ides, above the
belly, there is a large band, as in the gazelle.
The limbs are &s;lender in proportion to the
body; and they, as well as the thighs, are of
a deep brown, and of a dirty white colour on
the in&s;ide. The ends of the hairs which co|ver
the hoofs are likewi&s;e of a dirty white.
The feet are cloven, like tho&s;e of the &s;tag.
The two fore toes are broad and thin: The
&s;mall ones behind are long, pretty thin, and
flat on the in&s;ide. They are all extremely
black.&endq;</P>
<P>By the figure I have given, no judgment mu&s;t
be formed of the length and thickne&s;s of the
<PB N="355" REF="398">
rain-deer's horns, &s;ome of which extend back|ward
from the head as far as the crupper, and
project forward in antlers of more than a foot
long. The large fo&s;&s;il horns found in differ|ent
places, and particularly in Ireland, appear to
have belonged to the rain-deer &s;pecies. Mr
Colin&s;on informed me that he had &s;een &s;ome of
the&s;e fo&s;&s;il horns with an interval of ten feet be|tween
their extremities, and with brow-antlers,
like tho&s;e of the rain-deer.</P>
<P>It is to this &s;pecies, therefore, and not to that
of the elk, that the fo&s;&s;il bones of the animal
called <HI>mou&s;e-deer</HI> by the Briti&s;h are to be refer|red.
We mu&s;t acknowledge, however, that no
rain-deer now exi&s;t of &s;uch magnitude and
&s;trength as to carry horns &s;o long and ma&s;&s;y as
tho&s;e found in a fo&s;&s;il &s;tate in Ireland, as well
as in &s;everal other parts of Europe, and even in
North America<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In North America, we find horns which mu&s;t have be|longed to an animal of a prodigious magnitude. Similar horns are found in Ireland. They are branched, &amp;c.; <HI>Voyage de P. Kalm, tom. 2. p.</HI> 435.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, I knew only one &s;pecies of rain-deer,
to which I referred the caribou of America, and
the Greenland fallow-deer, de&s;cribed and engra|ven
by Mr Edwards: And, it is not long &s;ince I
was informed, that there were too &s;pecies, or
rather two varieties, the one much larger than
the other. The rain-deer, of which I have gi|ven
a figure, is the &s;mall kind, and probably the
<PB N="356" REF="399">
&s;ame with the Greenland fallow-deer of Mr
Edwards.</P>
<P>Some travellers tell us, that the rain-deer is
the fallow-deer of the North; that, in Green|land,
it is wild; and that the large&s;t of them
exceed not the &s;ize of a two-year old heifer<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. gen. des voyages, tom. 19. p. 37.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Pontoppidan a&s;&s;ures us, that the rain-deer pe|ri&s;h
in every part of the world; except the nor|thern
regions, where they are even obliged to
inhabit the mountains. He is le&s;s to be credit|ed
when he tells us, that their horns are move|able;
that the animal can turn them either for|ward
or backward; and that, above the eye-lids,
there is a &s;mall aperture in the &s;kin, through
which he &s;ees, when the &s;now prevents him from
opening his eyes. This la&s;t fact appears to be
imaginary, and borrowed from a practice of the
Laplanders, who cover their eyes with a piece
of &s;plit wood, to avoid the great &s;plendour of the
&s;now, which renders them blind in a few years,
if this precaution is neglected<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pont$ppidan's Nat. Hi&s;t. of Norway.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that the&s;e animals, in all their
movements, make a crackling noi&s;e: Inde|pendent
of running, even when &s;urpri&s;ed or
touched, this noi&s;e is heard. I have been a&s;|&s;ured
that the &s;ame thing happens to the elk;
but I cannot a&s;certain the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion.</P>

<PB N="357" REF="400">
<HEAD>Ob&s;ervations on the Rain-deer, by Profe&s;&s;or Cam|per
of Groningen.</HEAD>
<P>The rain-deer &s;ent to me from Lapland by the
way of Drontheim and Am&s;terdam, arrived at
Groningen the 21&s;t day of June 1771. It was
very feeble, not only on account of the heat of
the climate and the fatigue of the voyage, but
chiefly from an ulcer between the &s;econd &s;to|mach
and the diaphragm, of which it died the
next day. While it lived, it eat, with appetite,
gra&s;s, bread, and other things pre&s;ented to it,
and likewi&s;e drank pretty copiou&s;ly. It did not
die for want of nouri&s;hment; for, upon di&s;&s;ec|tion,
I found all its &s;tomachs full. Its death was
&s;low, and accompanied with convul&s;ions.</P>
<P>It was a male of four years old. In all the
bones of the &s;keleton, there were epiphy&s;es, which
proves that it had not yet acquired its full growth,
which happens not till five years of age. Hence
this animal may live at lea&s;t twenty years.</P>
<P>The colour of the body was brown, mixed
with black, yellow, and white. The hairs on
the belly, and particularly on the flanks, were
white, and brown at the points, as in other deer.
The hair on the limbs was a deep yellow; and
that on the head inclined to black. The hair
on the flanks, as well as on the neck and brea&s;t,
was long and bu&s;hy.</P>
<P><PB N="358" REF="401">
The hair which covered the body was &s;o
brittle, that, when &s;lightly pulled, it broke tran&s;|ver&s;ely.
It lay in an undulated form, and its
&s;ub&s;tance re&s;embled the pith of ru&s;hes. The
brittle part of it was white. The hair on the
head and the under part of the legs, as far as the
hoofs, had not this fragility, but, on the con|trary,
was as &s;trong as that of a cow.</P>
<P>The coronet of the hoofs was covered on all
&s;ides with very long hair. Between the toes of
the hind feet there was a broad pellicle, com|po&s;ed
of the &s;kin which covers the body, but
inter&s;per&s;ed with &s;mall glands.</P>
<P>In the hind feet, at the height of the coronets,
a kind of canal, &s;ufficient to admit a goo&s;e quill,
and filled with very long hairs, penetrated as far
as the articulation of the canon with the &s;mall
bones of the toes. I di&s;covered no &s;uch canal in
the fore feet; neither do I know the u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>The figure of this animal differed much from
that de&s;cribed by other authors, becau&s;e it was
extremely emaciated. The length of the body,
from the muzzle to the anus, was five feet, and
its height before three feet.</P>
<P>The eyes differ not from tho&s;e of the fallow-deer
or &s;tag. The pupil is tran&s;ver&s;e; and the
iris is brown, inclining to black. The eye-pits
re&s;emble tho&s;e of the &s;tag, and are filled with a
whiti&s;h, re&s;inous, and &s;omewhat tran&s;parent
matter. As in the fallow-deer, there are two
lachrymal ducts and canals. The upper eye-lid
<PB N="359" REF="402">
has very long, black <HI>cilia.</HI> It is not perfo|rated,
as &s;ome authors have fancied, but entire.
The Bi&s;hop of Pontoppidan, and, upon his au|thority,
M. Haller, have attempted to account
for this &s;uppo&s;ed perforation: They thought it
nece&s;&s;ary, in a country perpetually covered with
&s;now, to defend the animal's eyes again&s;t the
exce&s;&s;ive glare of reflected light. Man, who is
de&s;tined to live in all climates, prevents blind|ne&s;s
as much as po&s;&s;ible by veils, or &s;mall per|forated
machines, which weaken the &s;plendour
of the light. The rain-deer, who is made for
this climate alone, has no occa&s;ion for &s;uch me|chani&s;m.
But he is furni&s;hed with a nictitating
membrane, or an internal eye-lid, like the birds,
and &s;ome other quadrupeds. Neither is this
membrane perforated: It is capable of covering

<P>The no&s;e of the rain-deer is very large, like
that of the cow; and the muzzle is more or le&s;s
flat, and covered with long grayi&s;h hair, which
extends to the internal part of the no&s;tril. The
lips are likewi&s;e covered with hair, except a
&s;mall border, which is blacki&s;h, hard, and very
porous. The no&s;trils are very di&s;tant from each
other. The under lip is narrow, and the mouth
deep cut, as in the &s;heep.</P>
<P>He has eight cutting teeth in the under jaw;
but they are very &s;mall, and loo&s;ely fixed. Like
the other ruminating animals, he has no cutting
teeth in the upper jaw. But I thought I per|ceived
<PB N="360" REF="403">
tu&s;ks, though they had not yet pierced
the gums; and I ob&s;erved no &s;uch appearance
in the under jaw. Hor&s;es have tu&s;ks in both
jaws; but mares &s;eldom have any. The fallow-deer,
both males and females, &s;eldom or never
have tu&s;ks. But I lately procured the head of
a hind recently brought forth, which had a large
tu&s;k in the left &s;ide of the upper jaw: Nature
is &s;o various in this article, that no con&s;tant rule
can be e&s;tabli&s;hed. There are &s;ix grinders in
each &s;ide of both jaws, or twenty-four in all.</P>
<P>I have nothing to remark concerning the
horns; for they were only beginning to &s;hoot:
One of them was an inch and the other an
inch and a half high. Their ba&s;e was &s;ituated
nearer the occiput than the orbit of the eye.
The hair which covered them was beautifully
turned, and of a gray colour, inclining to black.
In viewing the two &s;hoots at a di&s;tance, they
had the appearance of two large mice &s;itting on
the animal's head.</P>
<P>The neck is &s;hort, and more arched than that
of the &s;heep, but le&s;s than that of the camel.
The body &s;eemed to be naturally robu&s;t. The
back is a little elevated toward the &s;houlders, and
pretty &s;traight every where el&s;e, though the ver|tebrae
are &s;omewhat arched.</P>
<P>The tail is very &s;mall, bent downward, and
garni&s;hed with long bu&s;hy hair.</P>
<P>The te&s;ticles are very &s;mall, and appear not
without the body. The penis is not large.
<PB N="361" REF="404">
The prepuce is naked, like a navel, full of
wrinkles in the in&s;ide, and covered with a cal|careous
cru&s;t.</P>
<P>The hoofs are large, long, and convex on the
out&s;ide. The &s;purs are al&s;o very long, and &s;ome
of them touch the ground when the animal
&s;tands. They were hollow, probably becau&s;e he
makes no u&s;e of them.</P>
<P>The inte&s;tines were exactly &s;imilar to tho&s;e
of the fallow-deer. There was no gall-bladder.
The kidneys were &s;mooth, and undivided. The
lungs and wind-pipe were very large.</P>
<P>The heart was of a middle &s;ize, and, like that
of the fallow-deer, contained only one &s;mall
bone. This bone &s;upported the ba&s;e of the &s;e|milunar
valve of the aorta, which is oppo&s;ed to
two others, from which the coronary arteries
of the heart derive their origin. It likewi&s;e
gives firmne&s;s to the membranous partition be|tween
the two cavities of the heart, and to the
triglochine valve of the right ventricle.</P>
<P>In this animal there is a &s;ingular pouch, very
large, membranous, and &s;ituated under the &s;kin
of the neck. It begins by a conical canal be|tween
the os hyoides and the thyroide cartilage.
This canal gradually enlarges, and is changed
into a kind of membranous &s;ac, &s;upported by
two oblong mu&s;cles, which derive their origin
from the inferior part of the os hyoides, preci&s;e|ly
where the ba&s;e, the pi&s;iform bone, and the
cornua unite.</P>
<P><PB N="362" REF="405">
This pouch opens into the larynx, under the
root of the epiglottis, by a large orifice, which
ea&s;ily admitted my finger.</P>
<P>When the animal pu&s;hed the air forcibly out
of the lungs, as in lowing, the air pa&s;&s;ed into this
pouch, &s;welled it, and nece&s;&s;arily produced a
con&s;iderable tumour, which greatly changed the
&s;ound. The two mu&s;cles drive the air out of
the pouch, when the animal cea&s;es its lowing.</P>
<P>About twenty years ago, I &s;howed a &s;imilar
pouch in &s;everal baboons and monkeys; and,

that there was a double pouch in the Ourang-outang.</P>

<P>THE Greeks, it is probable, were acquaint|ed

they have neither pointed out the&s;e animals by
particular denominations, nor by characters &s;o
<PB N="364" REF="409">
preci&s;e, as to enable us to di&s;tingui&s;h them.
They have denominated them, in general, <HI>wild
goats</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Rupicapras inter capras &s;ylve&s;tres adnumerare libet, quo|niam hoc nomen apud &s;olum Plinium legimus, et apud Grae|cos &s;impliciter <HI>ferae ca$rae</HI> dicuntur, ut conjicio: Nam et mag|nitudine et figura tum cornuum tum figura corporis ad villa|ticas proxime accedunt; <HI>Ge&s;ner. hi&s;t. quad. p.</HI> 292.</NOTE>.

Our modern naturali&s;ts, on the contra|ry,
have con&s;idered the wild and the chamois

from the common goat. There are facts and
arguments in favour of both opinions, of which
we &s;hall only give a detail, till we learn from
experience whether the&s;e animals can intermix
together, and produce fertile individuals; as this
circum&s;tance alone can determine the que&s;tion.</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="410">
The male wild goat differs from the chamois
in the length, thickne&s;s, and figure of his horns.
His body is al&s;o larger, and he is more vigorous
and &s;trong. The horns of the female wild goat
are &s;maller than tho&s;e of the male, and have a
great re&s;emblance to tho&s;e of the chamois<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Foemina in hoc genere mare &s;uo minor e&s;t, minu&s;que fu&s;ca, major Capra villatica, Rupicaprae non adeo di&s;&s;imilis: Cornua ei parva, et ea quoque Rupicaprae aut vulgaris caprae cornibus fere &s;imilia; <HI>Stumpfius apud Ge&s;ner, p.</HI> 305.</NOTE>.
Be&s;ides, the manners and di&s;po&s;itions of the&s;e
two animals are the &s;ame, and they inhabit the
&s;ame climate; only the wild goat, being &s;trong|er
and more agile, goes to the &s;ummits of the
highe&s;t mountains, while the chamois never ri&s;es

them are found in the plains. Both of them
clear roads in the &s;now, and leap from one pre|cipice

double fur, the external hair being coar&s;e, and the
internal finer and more bu&s;hy<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The chamois goat has longer legs than the dome&s;tic kind; but his hair is &s;horter. That which covers the belly and thighs is the longe&s;t, and exceeds not four inches and a half. On the back and flanks the hair is of two kinds; for, as in the beaver, be&s;ide the long external hair, there is a very &s;hort, fine hair, concealed round the roots of the longer kind. The head, the belly, and the legs, were covered with coar&s;e hair only; <HI>Mem. pour &s;ervir a I'hi&s;t. des Animaux, part. 1. p.</HI> 203.</NOTE>. Both of them

is &s;o great, and the conformity of the inter|nal

&s;imple, but permanent varieties of the &s;ame &s;pe|cies.
Be&s;ides, the wild, as well as the chamois
goats<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The inhabitants of the i&s;land of Crete might take the young of the bouc-e&s;tain (of which there are great quantities) wandering in the mountains, and feed and tame them along with the dome&s;tic kind....

We have &s;ome of them in the mountains of France, and chiefly in places full of precipices, and of difficult acce&s;s....

the &s;ame manners, go in flocks, return to the

I acknowledge, however, that this la&s;t
fact, which is the mo&s;t important of all, and
would alone decide the que&s;tion, is by no means
e&s;tabli&s;hed. We have never been able, with
certainty, to learn whether the wild and cha|mois
goats produce with the common kind<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In the compilation of natural hi&s;tory made by Me&s;&s;. Arnault de Nobleville and Salerne, it is &s;aid, (tom. 4. p. 264.) that the chamois goats are in &s;ea&s;on during almo&s;t the whole month of September; that the females go with young nine months; and that they generally bring forth in June. If the&s;e facts were true, they would demon&s;trate that the cha|mois is not the &s;ame &s;pecies with the goat, which goes with young about &s;ix months only: But I think they are &s;u&s;pi|cious, if not fal&s;e. The hunters, as appears from the pa&s;&s;ages already quoted, a&s;&s;ure us, on the contrary, that the chamois and wild goats do not come in &s;ea&s;on till the month of No|vember; and that the females bring forth in May. Thus the time of ge&s;tation, in&s;tead of being extended to nine months, &s;hould be reduced to near five, as in the dome&s;tic goat. But this matter mu&s;t be decided by experience alone.</NOTE>. We
only &s;u&s;pect this to be the ca&s;e. In this re&s;pect,
we agree with the antients; and, be&s;ides, our
<PB N="367" REF="412">
conjecture &s;eems to be founded on &s;trong ana|logies,
which are &s;eldom contradicted by expe|rience.</P>
<P>Let us, however, con&s;ider the oppo&s;ite argu|ments.
The wild and chamois goats both &s;ub|&s;i&s;t
in the &s;tate of nature, and yet they always
remain di&s;tinct. The chamois &s;ometimes mingles
&s;pontaneou&s;ly with the flocks of the dome&s;tic
kind<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Rupicaprae aliquando accedunt u&s;que ad greges capra|rum cicurum quos non refugiunt, quod non &s;aciunt ibices; <HI>Ge&s;ner, Hi&s;t. quad. p.</HI> 292.</NOTE>; but the wild goat never a&s;&s;ociates with
them, unle&s;s when tamed. The male wild goat
and the common he-goat have very long beards,
and the chamois has none. The horns of the
male and female chamois are &s;mall: Tho&s;e of
the wild he-goat are &s;o large and &s;o long<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibex egregium ut et corpulentum animal, &s;pecie fere cervina minus tamen, cruribus quidem gracilibus et capite parvo cervum exprimit.

<PB N="368" REF="413">
we could hardly imagine they belonged to an
animal of his &s;ize. The chamois &s;eems to differ
from the wild goat, and the common he-goat,
by the direction of his horns, which incline a
little forward in their inferior part, and bend
backward at the point like a hook. But, as we
remarked in the hi&s;tory of the ox and &s;heep,
the horns of dome&s;tic animals, as well as tho&s;e
$word$ wild animals living in different climates, vary
pr$digiou&s;ly. The horns of our female goat
are not entirely &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the male.
The horns of the male wild goat are not very different
from tho&s;e of our he-goat: And, as the
female wild goat approaches the dome&s;tic kind,
and even the chamois, in &s;ize, and in the &s;mall|ne&s;s
of its horns, may we not conclude, that the
males of$ the wild, chamois, and dome&s;tic goats,
are only one &s;pecies of animal, in which the
nature of the females is con&s;tant and &s;imilar a|mong
them&s;elves, but that the males are &s;ubject
to con&s;iderable variations? In this point of view,
which is not, perhaps, removed &s;o far from na|ture
as may be imagined, the wild goat would
be the original male &s;tock, and the chamois
would be the female<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The want of a beard in the chamois is a female charac|ter, which ought to be added to the others. The male cha|mois appears, as well as the female, to participate of the fe|minine qualities of the &s;he-goat. Thus it may be pre&s;umed, that the dome&s;tic he-goat would engender with the female chamois; and that, on the contrary, the male chamois could not engender with the female dome&s;tic goat. Time will verify or de&s;troy this conjecture.</NOTE>. I &s;ay, that this point
<PB N="369" REF="414">
of view is not imaginary, &s;ince we can prove
from experience, that there are animals in na|ture,
in which the female can equally &s;erve
males of different &s;pecies, and produce from
them both. The &s;heep produces with the he-goat
as well as with the ram, and always brings forth
lambs which are individuals of its own &s;pecies.
The ram, on the contrary, produces not with the
&s;he-goat. The &s;heep, therefore, may be regard|ed
as a female common to two different males;
and, con&s;equently, &s;he con&s;titutes a &s;pecies inde|pendent
of the male. The &s;ame thing will hap|pen
to the wild goat. The female alone repre|&s;ents
the primitive &s;pecies, becau&s;e her nature is
con&s;tant. The males, on the contrary, vary;
and it is extremely probable, that the dome&s;tic
&s;he-goat, which may be con&s;idered as the &s;ame
female as tho&s;e of the wild and chamois kinds,
would produce equally with the&s;e three different
males, which alone admit of varieties in &s;pecies;
and, con&s;equently, though they &s;eem to change
the unity, alter not the identity of the &s;pecies.</P>
<P>The&s;e, as well as all other po&s;&s;ible relations,
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily exi&s;t in nature. It even ap|pears,
that the females contribute more to the
&s;upport of the &s;pecies than the males; for,
though both concur in the fir&s;t formation of the
<PB N="370" REF="415">
foetus, the female, who afterwards furni&s;hes
every thing nece&s;&s;ary to its growth and nutri|tion,
modifies and a&s;&s;imilates it more to her own
nature, and mu&s;t, therefore, greatly efface the
impre&s;&s;ion of the parts derived from the male.
Thus, if we want to form a di&s;tinct judgment
of a &s;pecies, we ought to examine the females.
The male be&s;tows one half of the animated &s;ub|&s;tance:
The female gives an equal portion, and
furni&s;hes, be&s;ides, all the matter nece&s;&s;ary for
the developement of the form. A beautiful wo|man
&s;eldom fails to produce beautiful children.
The offspring of a beautiful man with an ugly
woman, are generally &s;till more ugly.</P>
<P>Hence, even in the &s;ame &s;pecies, there may
&s;ometimes be two races, the one ma&s;culine and
the other feminine, which, by both &s;ub&s;i&s;ting
and perpetuating their di&s;tinctive characters, ap|pear
to con&s;titute two different &s;pecies; and this
&s;eems to be the ca&s;e, when it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible
to fix the limits between what naturali&s;ts term
<HI>&s;pecies</HI> and <HI>variety.</HI> Let us &s;uppo&s;e, for ex|ample,
that &s;ome &s;heep were always &s;erved with
he-goats, and others with rams; after a certain
number of generations, a race would be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
among the &s;pecies of &s;heep, which would
partake greatly of the nature of the goat, and
would afterwards perpetuate its own kind; for,
though the fir&s;t produce of the he-goat would
be little removed from the mother's &s;pecies, and
would be a lamb, and not a kid; yet this lamb
<PB N="371" REF="416">
is already covered with hair, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;ome
other characters of the father. Let the&s;e fe|male
mongrels be afterwards &s;erved with a he-goat;
the produce in this &s;econd generation will
make a nearer approach to the &s;pecies of the
father, and &s;till nearer in the third, &amp;c. In this
manner, the foreign characters would &s;oon over-balance
the natural ones; and this fictitious race
might &s;upport it&s;elf, and form a variety in the
&s;pecies, the origin of which would be difficult to
trace. Now, what might ari&s;e from the influ|ence
of one &s;pecies on another, may be produced
with greater ea&s;e in the &s;ame &s;pecies. If vigo|rous
females be con&s;tantly &s;erved with feeble
males, in proce&s;s of time, a feminine race will
be e&s;tabli&s;lied; and, if very &s;trong males are ap|propriated
to females of inferior &s;trength and
vigour, a ma&s;culine race will be the re&s;ult, &s;o
different in appearance from the fir&s;t, that we
could not a&s;&s;ign to them a common origin, and,
of cour&s;e, would regard them as two di&s;tinct
&s;pecies.</P>
<P>To the&s;e general reflections, we &s;hall add &s;ome
particular facts. We are a&s;&s;ured by Linnaeus<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>Capra cornibus depre&s;&s;is, incurvis, minimis, cranio in|cumbentibus, gula barbata.

Lin|naeus, I &s;u&s;pect, has not been properly informed with regard to the country of this animal, and I believe it to be a native of Africa. My rea&s;ons are, 1. That no author mentions this &s;pecies of goat, nor even the common goat, as being ever found in America; 2. That all travellers, on the contrary, agree in a&s;&s;uring us, that there are three kinds of goats in Africa, a large, a middle, and a &s;mall kind; 3.

that he &s;aw in Holland two animals of the goat-kind,
of which the one had very &s;hort, thick
horns, lying almo&s;t flat on the &s;kull; the horns
of the other were erect, and bended backward
at the points, and its hair was &s;hort. The&s;e
animals, though they &s;eemed to be more remote
in &s;pecies than the chamois and common goat,
failed not to produce together; which demon|&s;trates
that the&s;e differences in the figure of the
horns and length of the hair, are not e&s;&s;ential
and &s;pecific characters; for, as the animals pro|duced
together, they mu&s;t be regarded as belong|ing
to the &s;ame &s;pecies. From this example, it
may be concluded, that the chamois and our
goat, who&s;e principal differences lie in the form
of the horns and the length of the hair, are pro|bably
the &s;ame &s;pecies.</P>

of the bones, it has a perfect re&s;em|blance
to the dome&s;tic he-goat; and the figure
of the under jaw is the &s;ame with that of the
wild goat. But it differs from both in the horns:
Tho&s;e of the wild goat have prominent tubercles
or knobs, and two longitudinal ridges, between
which there is a well marked anterior face:
Tho&s;e of the common he-goat have but one
ridge, and no tubercles. The horns of the ca|pricorne
have but one ridge, and no anterior
face: Though they want tubercles, they have
rugo&s;ities which are larger than tho&s;e of the he-goat.
The&s;e differences &s;eem to indicate an in|termediate
race between the wild and the do|me&s;tic

are &s;hort, and crooked at the point, like
tho&s;e of the chamois; and, at the &s;ame time,
they are compre&s;&s;ed and ringed: Hence they

us, that there are in that i&s;land, 1. The
<PB N="374" REF="419">
common dome&s;tic goat of Europe; 2. the cha|mois;
3. the wild goat. He a&s;&s;ures us, that
none of the&s;e animals are natives of America,
but have been tran&s;ported from Europe; that,
like the &s;heep, they have degenerated and be|come
&s;maller in this new country; that
the wool of the &s;heep is changed into hair as coar&s;e
as that of the goat; that the wild goat &s;eems to
be a ba&s;tard race, &amp;c. Hence we are led to
believe, that the &s;mall goat with erect horns,
and crooked at the points, which Linnaeus &s;aw
in Holland, and was &s;aid to have come from A|merica,
is the chamois of Jamaica, that is, the
European chamois degenerated and dimini&s;hed
by the climate of America; and that the wild
goat of Jamaica, called the <HI>ba&s;tard wild goat</HI>
<PB N="375" REF="420">
by Mr Brown, is our capricorne, which &s;eems
to be nothing el&s;e than the wild goat degenera|ted
by the influence of climate.</P>
<P>M. Daubenton, after &s;crupulou&s;ly examining
the relations of the chamois to the he-goat and
ram, &s;ays, in general, that it has a greater re&s;em|blance
to the he-goat than to the ram. Next to
the horns, the chief differences are found in the
figure and &s;ize of the front, which is le&s;s eleva|ted
and &s;horter, and the form of the no&s;e, which
is more contracted in the chamois than in the
he-goat; &s;o that, in the&s;e two articles, the cha|mois
re&s;embles the ram more than the he-goat.
But, by &s;uppo&s;ing, what is extremely probable,
that the chamois is a con&s;tant variety of the
&s;pecies of the he-goat, as the bull-dog and grey|hound
are con&s;tant varieties in the dog-kind, we
will perceive that the&s;e differences in the &s;ize
of the front and the po&s;ition of the no&s;e, are not
nearly &s;o great in the chamois, when compared
with the he-goat, as in the bull-dog and grey|hound,
which, however, produce together, and
certainly belong to the &s;ame &s;pecies. Be&s;ides,
as the chamois re&s;embles the he-goat in a great|er
number of characters than the ram, if he con|&s;tituted
a particular &s;pecies, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be
an intermediate one between the he-goat and
the ram. Now, we have &s;een, that the he-goat
and ewe produce together: The chamois, there|fore,
which is an intermediate &s;pecies between
the two, and, at the &s;ame time, has a greater
<PB N="376" REF="421">
number of re&s;emblances to the he-goat than to
the ram, ought to produce with the &s;he-goat, and,
con&s;equently, &s;hould be regarded as only a con|&s;tant
variety of this &s;pecies.</P>
<P>Hence, as the chamois was tran&s;ported in|to
America, where it has become &s;maller, and
produces with the &s;mall &s;he-goat of Africa, it is
more than probable that he would al&s;o pro$$e
with our &s;he-goats. The chamois, $span$
only a con&s;tant variety in the goat-gind,
like the bull-dog in the &s;pecies of dog.
On the other hand, the wild goat is unque&s;tion|ably
the primitive goat in a &s;tate of nature, and
is, with regard to the dome&s;tic goats, what the
mouflon is to the &s;heep. The wild he-goat
perfectly re&s;embles the dome&s;tic he-goat in fi|gure,
&s;tructure, habits, and di&s;po&s;itions; and
there are only two &s;light external differences be|tween
them. The horns of the wild he-goat
are larger than tho&s;e of the common he-goat.
The former have two longitudinal ridges, and
the latter but one. They have al&s;o large tran&s;|ver&s;e
protuberant rings, which mark the years of
their growth; whil&s;t tho&s;e of the dome&s;tic he-goat
have only a kind of tran&s;ver&s;e &s;triae or
furrows. The figure of their bodies is preci&s;e|ly
the &s;ame. Their internal &s;tructure is likewi&s;e
perfectly &s;imilar, with the exception of the
&s;pleen, which is oval in the wild he-goat, and
approaches nearer to the &s;pleen of the roebuck
or &s;tag, than to that of the he-goat or ram.
<PB N="377" REF="422">
This difference may proceed from the violent
exerci&s;e of the animal. The wild he-goat runs
as &s;wiftly as the &s;tag, and leaps more nimbly
than the roebuck. His &s;pleen, therefore, &s;hould
re&s;emble that of the &s;wifte&s;t running animals.
Hence this &s;light difference depends more upon
habit than nature; and it is probable, that, if
our dome&s;tic he-goat &s;hould become wild, and
were obliged to run and leap like the wild he-goat,
his &s;pleen would &s;oon a&s;&s;ume the figure
mo&s;t conformable to this exerci&s;e. With re|gard
to the difference of his horns, though very
con&s;picuous, they fail not to re&s;emble tho&s;e of the
dome&s;tic he-goat more than tho&s;e of any other
animal. Thus the wild and common he-goat
approach nearer each other, even in the form
of their horns, than any other animal; and, as
their re&s;emblance is complete in every other
article, we &s;hould conclude, that, notwith&s;tand|ing
this &s;light and &s;olitary difference, they are
both animals of the &s;ame &s;pecies.</P>
<P>The wild, the chamois, and the dome&s;tic goat
mu&s;t, therefore, be con&s;idered as the &s;ame &s;pe|cies,
the males of which have undergone great|er
variations than the females: I find, at the
&s;ame time, in the dome&s;tic kind, &s;econdary va|rieties,
which are the le&s;s equivocal, becau&s;e they
belong equally to the males and females. We
have &s;een that the goat of Angora<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See vol. III. p. 493.</NOTE>, though very
<PB N="378" REF="423">
different from ours in the hairs and horns, is ne|verthele&s;s
of the &s;ame &s;pecies. The &s;ame thing
may be &s;aid of the Juda goat, which Linnaeus has
properly con&s;idered as a variety of the dome&s;tic
&s;pecies. This goat, which is common in Gui|ney<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In Guiney there are great numbers of goats &s;imilar to tho&s;e in Europe, except that, like all the other cattle, they are very &s;mall.

be &s;aid to differ from ours only in being &s;maller,
fatter, and more &s;quat. Its fle&s;h is excellent;

the common &s;pecies. This variety of the Mam|brina

the goat of Angora; for we find goats with long

M. D.</HI></NOTE>, which the natives of the Ea&s;t prefer to
that of the cow or buffalo.</P>
<P>With regard to the &s;mall goat which Linnaeus
&s;aw alive, and which produced with the Ameri|can
chamois, it mu&s;t, as formerly remarked,
have been originally tran&s;ported from Africa;
for it &s;o &s;trongly re&s;embles the he-goat of Africa,
that it is unque&s;tionably the &s;ame &s;pecies; or, at
lea&s;t, it has &s;prung from the &s;ame &s;tock. In A|frica
it is &s;mall; and it would become &s;till le&s;s
in America; and we learn, from the te&s;timony
of travellers, that &s;heep, hogs, and goats, have
frequently, and for &s;everal ages back, been tran&s;|ported
from Africa, as well as Europe, into A|merica,
where they &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t, without any o|ther
change than a diminution of &s;ize.</P>
<P>After examining the different varieties of goats,
of which the nomenclators have made nine or
ten different &s;pecies, I am convinced that they
<PB N="380" REF="425">
ought to be reduced to one: 1. The wild he-goat
is the principal &s;tock of the &s;pecies. 2.
The capricorn is the wild he-goat degenerated
by the influence of climate. 3. The dome&s;tic
he-goat derives his origin from the wild he-goat.
4. The chamois is only a variety in the
&s;pecies of the &s;he-goat, with whom, like the wild
he-goat, he &s;hould be able to mix and produce.
5. The &s;mall goat, with erect horns, crooked at
the points, mentioned by Linnaeus, is the European
chamois dimini&s;hed by the influence of the
American climate. 6. The other &s;mall goat, with
horns lying flat on the &s;kull, and which produ|ced
with the American chamois, is the &s;ame with
the African he-goat; the fertility of the&s;e two
animals is a proof that our chamois and dome&s;|tic
goat would al&s;o produce together, and, of
cour&s;e, that they belong to the &s;ame &s;pecies. 7.
The dwarf goat, which is probably the female
of the African buck, is only, as well as the male,
a variety of the common kind. 8. The &s;ame
thing may be &s;aid of the buck and &s;he-goat of
Juda; for they are only varieties of our dome&s;tic
goat. 9. The goat of Angora, as it produces
with our goats<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See vol. III. Article Goat.</NOTE>, belongs to the &s;ame &s;pecies.
10. The Mambrina or Syrian goat, with very
long pendulous ears, is a variety of the goat of
Angora. Thus the&s;e ten animals are only different
races of the &s;ame &s;pecies, which have
<PB N="381" REF="426">
been produced by the influence of climate. <HI>Ca|prae
in multas &s;imilitudines transfigurantur,</HI> &s;ays
Pliny<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Caprae tamen in plurimas &s;imilitudines transfigurantur; &s;unt capreae, &s;unt rupicaprae, &s;unt ibices.&mdash;Sunt et origes.&mdash;Sunt et Damae et Pygargi et Strep&s;icerotes, multaque alia haud di&s;&s;imilia; <HI>lib. 8. cap.</HI> 53.</NOTE>. Indeed, from this enumeration, it is
apparent, that the goats, though e&s;&s;entially &s;i|milar
among them&s;elves, vary greatly in their
external form; and, if we comprehend, like
Pliny, under the generic name of <HI>Goats,</HI> not
only tho&s;e we have mentioned, but likewi&s;e the
roebuck, the antilopes, &amp;c. this &s;pecies would
be the mo&s;t exten&s;ive in Nature, and contain
more races and varieties than that of the dog.
But Pliny, when he joined the roebuck, anti|lopes,
&amp;c. to the &s;pecies of the goat, betrayed
his ignorance of the real di&s;tinction of &s;pecies.
The&s;e animals, though they re&s;emble the goat
in many re&s;pects, con&s;titute two different &s;pe|cies;
and we will perceive from the following
articles, how greatly the antilopes vary both in
&s;pecies and in races; and, after enumerating all
the antilopes and all the goats, we will &s;till
find other animals which participate of both.
In the whole hi&s;tory of quadrupeds, I have met
with nothing &s;o confu&s;ed, &s;o uncertain, and &s;o
ob&s;cure, as the accounts given us by naturali&s;ts
and travellers concerning the goats, the anti|lopes,
and the &s;pecies which have a relation to
them. I have exerted every effort to throw
<PB N="382" REF="427">
light upon this &s;ubject; and &s;hall not regret my
labour, if what I now write &s;hould contribute
to remove error, and to extend the views of
tho&s;e who incline to &s;tudy Nature. But to re|turn
to our &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The goats are &s;ubject to vertigos: This di&s;ea&s;e
is likewi&s;e common to the wild and chamois
goats<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In the mountains of Switzerland, the chamois or wild goats are very frequent.&mdash;The natives inform us, that the&s;e animals are &s;ubject to vertigos; and that, when attacked with this di&s;ea&s;e, they &s;ometimes come down to the meadows, and mix with the hor&s;es and cows, when they are taken with ea&s;e; <HI>Extrait du voyage de Jean-Jacques Scheuchzer; Nouvelles de la Re|publique des Lettres, p.</HI> 182.</NOTE>, as well as the inclination to climb up|on
rocks, and the habit of perpetually licking
&s;tones<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Conveniunt &s;aepe circa petras qua&s;dam areno&s;as, et are|nam inde lingunt.&mdash;Qui Alpes incolunt Helvetii hos lo|cos &s;ua lingua <HI>Fultzen</HI> tanquam &s;alarios appellant; <HI>Ge&s;ner, hi&s;t. quad. p.</HI> 292.&mdash;What is &s;ingular, in the Alps there are &s;eve|ral rocks which have been hollowed by the con&s;tant licking of the chamois goats. This licking is not occa&s;ioned, as has been alledged, by &s;alt contained in the&s;e &s;tones, which is very rarely the ca&s;e; for the rocks are porous, and compo&s;ed of grains of &s;and, which are ea&s;ily detached; and they are &s;wallowed by the animals with great avidity; <HI>Extrait de Scheuchzer, ibid. p.</HI> 185.</NOTE>, e&s;pecially tho&s;e which are impregnated
with nitre or &s;alt. In the Alps, we find rocks
hollowed with the tongues of the chamois.
They are generally compo&s;ed of tender and cal|cinable
&s;tones, in which there is always a cer|tain
quantity of nitre. The&s;e conformities in
natural di&s;po&s;itions and manners appear to be
<PB N="383" REF="428">
infallible indications of identity of &s;pecies. The
Greeks, as formerly remarked, did not divide
the&s;e three animals into three di&s;tinct kinds;
and our hunters, who probably never con&s;ulted
the Greeks, have al&s;o regarded them as the &s;ame
&s;pecies. Ga&s;ton Phaebus<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">La venerie de Ga&s;ton Phaebus, p. 68.</NOTE>, when treating of
the wild goat, points him out under the name
of the <HI>wild buck;</HI> and the chamois, which he
calls <HI>y&s;arus and &s;arris,</HI> in his e&s;timation, is only
another wild buck. I acknowledge that all the&s;e
authorities amount not to a complete proof: But,
when joined to the facts and rea&s;onings already
employed, they form &s;o &s;trong a pre&s;umption, with
regard to the unity of &s;pecies in the&s;e three ani|mals,
as leaves no room for he&s;itation.</P>
<P>The wild and chamois goats, which I con&s;i|dered,
the one as the male, and the other as the
female &s;tock of the goat-kind, are only found,
like the mouflon, which is the &s;tock of the &s;heep,
in the de&s;erts and in the highe&s;t and mo&s;t rug|ged
mountains. The Alps, the Pyrennees, the
Grecian mountains, and tho&s;e in the i&s;lands of
the Archipelago, are almo&s;t the only places where
the wild and chamois goats are to be met with.
Though both avoid heat, and inhabit the regions
of &s;now and fro&s;t; yet they equally avoid the
exce&s;&s;ive rigours of cold. In &s;ummer they dwell
on the northern &s;ides of the mountains; in win|ter,
they frequent the &s;outhern &s;ides, and de|&s;cend
<PB N="384" REF="429">
from the &s;ummits into the plains. Nei|ther
of them can &s;upport them&s;elves on &s;mooth
&s;heets of ice; but, when the ice is rendered
rough by the &s;now, they run and bound with
great firmne&s;s and agility. The chace of tho&s;e
animals<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>There are two kinds of bucks; &s;ome are called <HI>wild bucks,</HI> and others <HI>y&s;arus</HI> or <HI>&s;arris.</HI> The wild bucks are as large as a &s;tag; but, though they have as much fle&s;h, they are neither &s;o long, nor make &s;uch large bounds.

A black bar runs along their back and down the buttocks. Their belly is yellow, and their legs black, and yellow behind. Their feet, like tho&s;e of the dome&s;tic goat, are cloven; and their tracks are large, and rounder than tho&s;e of the &s;tag. The female, like that of the hind, or common &s;he-goat, produces but one at a time.</P>
<P>The bucks feed upon herbage like other cattle.&mdash;Their dung re&s;embles that of the dome&s;tic goat. They come in &s;ea&s;on about All Saints-day, and their rutting &s;ea&s;on continues a month. When that &s;ea&s;on is over, they are much emaciated; and they de&s;cend from the rocks and mountains, where they had dwelt during the &s;ummer, to the plains, in que&s;t of food. They remain at the foot of the mountains till toward Ea&s;ter, when they return to the mo&s;t elevated places they can find, and each takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his bu&s;h, like the &s;tags. The females, at this period, &s;eparate from the males, and retire near the brooks, in order to fawn, where they remain during the &s;ummer. When the bucks are thus &s;eparated from the females, e&s;pecially at the approach of the rutting &s;ea&s;on, they attack both man and bea&s;t. They al&s;o fight among them&s;elves, like the &s;tags, but in a different manner; for their quarrels are more formidable. The buck &s;trikes &s;o furiou&s;ly with his head, that he often breaks the legs of tho&s;e whom he attacks; and, if he runs a man again&s;t a tree, or throws him down on the ground, death is infalli|bly the con&s;equence. Such is the nature of the buck, that, though a &s;trong man gives him a blow on the back with a bar of iron, the animal's &s;pine is not broken. In the &s;ea&s;on of love, his neck &s;wells prodigiou&s;ly: And, though he falls from a height of ten fathoms, he receives no injury.</P>
<P>The buck called <HI>Y&s;arus</HI> is of the &s;ame figure with the pre|ceding, and is not larger than the dome&s;tic he-goat. His na|ture is the &s;ame with that of the wild buck.&mdash;Like the &s;tag, both come in &s;ea&s;on about All Saints-day, and they &s;hould be hunted till that period arrives.&mdash;When they can find no other food in winter, they eat the leaves of the pine-tree, which are always green. Their &s;kin, when pro|perly dre&s;&s;ed, is an excellent defence again&s;t the cold; for, when the hair is outmo&s;t, neither cold nor rain can pene|trate it. Their fle&s;h is not very whole&s;ome; for it produces fevers.&mdash;The hunting of the buck is not very plea&s;ant; for we can neither accompany the dogs on foot nor on hor&s;eback; <HI>Ga&s;ton Phaebus, Venerie de Du&s;oilloux, p.</HI> 68.</P></NOTE>, e&s;pecially that of the wild he-goat,

this kind of hunting. It is al&s;o &s;ometimes dange|rous:

he gives the hunter a violent blow with his
head, and often throws him over a precipice<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Ibex venatorem expectat, et &s;olicite ob&s;ervat an inter ip&s;um et rupem minimum inter&s;it &s;patium; nam &s;i vi&s;u dum|taxat intertueri (ut ita loquar) po&s;&s;it, impetu facto &s;e tran&s;|fert et venatorem impul&s;um praecipitat; <HI>Stumpfius apud Ge&s;ner, p.</HI> 305.</NOTE>.
Though not &s;o &s;trong as the wild bucks, the
chamois goats are equally active<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">M. Perroud, undertaker of the cry&s;tal mines in the Alps, brought a live chamois to Ver&s;ailles, and gave us the follow|ing excellent remarks on the nature and manners of this ani|mal. &startq;The chamois, though a wild animal, is very docile. He inhabits only the mountains and rocks. He is of the &s;ize of a dome&s;tic goat, whom he greatly re&s;embles. His vivacity is delightful, and his agility truly admirable. His hair is as &s;hort as that of a hind: In &s;pring, it is a&s;h-coloured, in &s;ummer it is yellowi&s;h, in autumn yellowi&s;h brown mixed with black, and, in winter, browni&s;h black. The chamois goats are numerous in the mountains of Upper Dauphiny, Peidmont, Savoy, Switzerland, and Germany. They are very &s;ocial among them&s;elves: We find them go|ing in pairs, or in little flocks of from three to twenty; and &s;ometimes we &s;ee from &s;ixty to a hundred of them di&s;per&s;ed in different flocks along the declivity of the &s;ame mountain. The large males keep at a di&s;tance from the re&s;t, except in the rutting &s;ea&s;on, when they join the females, and beat off all the young. At this period, their ardour is &s;till &s;tronger than that of the wild bucks. They bleat often, and run from one mountain to another. Their &s;ea&s;on of love is in the months of October and November, and they bring forth in March and April. A young female takes the male at the age of eighteen months. The females bring forth one, but rarely two, at a time. The young follow their mothers till October, if not di&s;per&s;ed by the hunters or the wolves. We are a&s;&s;ured that they live between twenty and thirty years. Their fle&s;h is very good. A fat chamois goat will yield from ten to twelve pounds of &s;u$t, which is harder and better than that of the goat. The blood of the chamois is extremely hot, and it is &s;aid to have qualities and virtues nearly equal to tho&s;e of the wild goat, and may &s;erve the &s;ame purpo&s;es; for the effects are the &s;ame, when taken in a double do&s;e. It is good again&s;t pleuri&s;ies, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the property of purifying the blood, and promoting per&s;piration. The hunters &s;ometimes mix the blood of the wild and chamois goats: At other times, they &s;ell the blood of the wild goat for that of the chamois. It is very difficult to di&s;tin|gui&s;h them; which &s;hows that the blood of the wild goat differs very little from that of the chamois. The voice of the chamois is a very low and almo&s;t imperceptible kind of bleating, re&s;embling that of a hoar&s;e dome&s;tic goat. It is by this bleating that they collect together, particularly the mo|thers and their young. But, when alarmed, or when they per|ceive their enemy, or any thing the nature of which they cannot di&s;tingui&s;h, they adverti&s;e one another by a kind of whi&s;tling noi&s;e, which I &s;hall afterwards de&s;cribe. The &s;ight of the chamois is very penetrating, and his &s;en&s;e of &s;mell|ing is acute. When he &s;ees a man di&s;tinctly, he &s;tops for &s;ome time, and flies off when he makes a nearer approach. His &s;en&s;e of hearing is equally acute as that of &s;melling; for he hears the &s;malle&s;t noi&s;e. When the wind blows in the direction between him and a man, he will perceive the &s;cent at the di&s;tance of more than half a league. Hence, when he &s;mells or hears any thing which he cannot &s;ee, he whi&s;tles or blows with &s;uch force, that the rocks and fore&s;ts re-eccho the &s;ound. If there are many of them near, they all take the alarm. This whi&s;tling is as long as the animal can blow, without taking breath. It is at fir&s;t &s;harp, and turns flat at the end. The chamois then &s;tops for a moment, looks round on all &s;ides, and begins whi&s;tling afre&s;h, which he continues from time to time. His agitation is extreme. He &s;trikes the earth with his feet. He leaps upon the highe&s;t &s;tones he can find: He again looks round, leaps from one eminence to an|other, and, when he di&s;covers any thing, he flies off. The whi&s;tling of the male is &s;harper than that of the female. This whi&s;tling is performed through the no&s;trils, and con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;trong blowing, &s;imilar to the &s;ound which a man may make by fixing his tongue to the palate, with his teeth nearly &s;hut, his lips open, and &s;omewhat extended, and blowing long and with great force. The chamois feeds on the fine&s;t herbs. He &s;elects the mo&s;t delicate parts of plants, as the flowers and the tendere&s;t buds. He is very fond of &s;ome aromatic herbs, particularly of the carline thi&s;tle and genipay, which are the hotte&s;t plants that grow in the Alps. When he eats green herbs, he drinks very little. He is very fond of the leaves and tender buds of &s;hrubs. He ruminates like the common goat. The food he u&s;es &s;eems to announce the heat of his con&s;titu|tion. This animal is admired for his large round eyes, who&s;e &s;ize corre&s;ponds with the vivacity of his di&s;po&s;ition. His head is adorned with two &s;mall horns, from half a foot to nine inches in length. Their colour is a fine black, and they are placed on the front nearly between his eyes; and, in|&s;tead of being reflected backward, like tho&s;e of other animals, they advance forward above the eyes, and bend backward at the points, which are extremely &s;harp. He adju&s;ts his ears mo&s;t beautifully to the points of his horns. Two tu&s;ts of black hair de&s;cend from his horns to the &s;ides of his face. The re&s;t of the head is of a yellowi&s;h white colour, which never changes. The horns of the chamois are u&s;ed for the heads of canes. Tho&s;e of the female are &s;maller and le&s;s crooked. The &s;kin of the chamois, when dre&s;&s;ed, is very &s;trong, nervous, and &s;upple, and makes excellent riding breeches, gloves, and ve&s;ts. Garments of this kind la&s;t long, and are of great u&s;e to manufacturers. The chamois is a native of cold countries, and always prefers rugged rocks and lofty places. They frequent the woods; but it is only tho&s;e in the higher regions of the mountains. The&s;e woods con|&s;i&s;ts of pines, larches, and beeches. The chamois goats are &s;o impatient of heat, that, in &s;ummer, they are only to be found under the &s;hades of caverns in the rocks, among ma&s;&s;es of congealed &s;now and ice, or in elevated fore&s;ts on the northern declivities of the mo&s;t &s;cabrous mountains, where the rays of the &s;un &s;eldom penetrate. They pa&s;ture in the mornings and evenings, and &s;eldom during the day. They traver&s;e the rocks and precipices with great facility, where the dogs dare not follow them. There is nothing more worthy of ad|miration than to &s;ee the&s;e animals climbing or de&s;cending inacce&s;&s;ible rocks. They neither mount nor de&s;cend perpendi|cularly, but in an oblique line. When de&s;cending, particu|larly, they throw them&s;elves down acro&s;s a rock, which is near|ly perpendicular, and of twenty or thirty feet in height, with|out having a &s;ingle prop to &s;upport their feet. In de&s;cend|ing, they &s;trike their feet three or four times again&s;t the rock, till they arrive at a proper re&s;ting-place below. The &s;pring of their tendons is &s;o great, that, when leaping about among the precipices, one would imagine they had wings in&s;tead of limbs. It has been alledged, that the chamois, in climbing and de&s;cending rocks, &s;upports him&s;elf by his horns. I have &s;een and killed many of the&s;e animals; but I never &s;aw them u&s;e their horns for this purpo&s;e; neither did I ever hear the fact &s;upported by any hunter. It is by the &s;trength and agi|lity of his limbs that the chamois is enabled to climb and de|&s;cend rocks. His legs are very free and tall; tho&s;e behind are somewhat longer, and always crooked, which favours their &s;pringing to a great di&s;tance; and, when they throw them|&s;elves from a height, the hind legs receive the &s;hock, and per|form the office of two &s;prings in breaking the fall. It is &s;aid, that, when there are numbers of chamois goats together, one is deputed to &s;tand &s;entinel, for the protection of the re&s;t. I have &s;een many flocks of them, but never ob&s;erved this part of their oeconomy. It is true, that, when there are many of them, &s;ome always watch while others eat; but I remarked nothing more &s;ingular here than what happens in a flock of &s;heep: For the fir&s;t who perceives any thing alarming, ad|verti&s;es the re&s;t, and, in an in&s;tant, the &s;ame terror is communi|cated to the whole. In great &s;nows, and during the rigour of winter, the chamois goats inhabit the lower fore&s;ts, and live upon pine leaves, the buds of trees, bu&s;hes, and &s;uch green or dry herbs as they can find by &s;cratching off the &s;now with their feet. The fore&s;ts that delight them mo&s;t, are tho&s;e which are very full of rocks and precipices. The hunting of the chamois is very difficult and laborious. The mode mo&s;t in u&s;e is to kill them by &s;urpri&s;e. The hunters con|ceal them&s;elves behind rocks or large &s;tones, taking care that the wind blows oppo&s;ite to them, and, when a favourable op|portunity occurs, &s;hoot them with mu&s;ket-balls. They are likewi&s;e hunted in the &s;ame manner as &s;tags and other ani|mals, by po&s;ting &s;ome of the hunters in narrow pa&s;&s;ages, while others beat about to rai&s;e the game. Men are prefer|able for this purpo&s;e to dogs; for dogs too quickly di&s;|per&s;e the animals, who fly off &s;uddenly to the di&s;tance of four or five leagues.&endq; See al&s;o on this &s;ubject <HI>La troi&s;ieme de&s;cript. du Voyage des Alpes de Schechuzer, p.</HI> 11.</NOTE>.

<P>We here give a figure of a Juda buck, which
appears to be different from that publi&s;hed in
the original work. M. Bourgelat had it alive,

and &s;till keeps its &s;kin in his anatomical cabinet.
It was con&s;iderably larger than the one former|ly
engraved. It was two feet nine inches long,
and one foot &s;even inches high, while the o|ther
was only twenty-four inches and a half
long, and &s;eventeen inches high. The head
and whole body were covered with large white
hairs. The points of the no&s;trils were black.
The horns nearly touch each other at the ba&s;e,

tho&s;e of the former, which the pre&s;ent one re|&s;embles

<P>We formerly mentioned Syrian goats with
pendulous ears, which were nearly of the &s;ame
&s;ize with the dome&s;tic kind, and produced with
them even in our climate. In Madaga&s;car
there is a goat con&s;iderably larger, with pen|dulous
ears &s;o long, that, when they fall down,
they cover the eyes, which obliges the animal
to move its head almo&s;t continually in throw|ing
them back. Hence, when pur&s;ued, it al|ways
endeavours to a&s;cend. This notice was
communicated to us by M. Comer&s;on; but it
is too imperfect to enable us to determine whe|ther
this goat belongs to the Syrian race with
pendulous ears, or to a different &s;pecies.</P>

The horns of this antilope are about a foot in
length. They have entire rings at their ba&s;e, and
then half rings till within a &s;mall di&s;tance from
the extremities, which are &s;mooth and pointed.
They are not only &s;urrounded with rings, but
furrowed longitudinally. The rings mark the
years of growth, and they are commonly from
twelve to thirteen in number. The antilopes
in general, and this &s;pecies in particular, have a
great re&s;emblance to the roebuck in figure, na|tural
functions, nimblene&s;s of movement, viva|city,
largene&s;s of the eyes, &amp;c. And, as the
roebuck exi&s;ts not in the countries inhabited
by the antilope, we would at fir&s;t be led to con|clude,
that it is only a degenerated roebuck, or
that the roebuck is an antilope who&s;e nature
has been changed by the effects of climate and
food. But the antilopes differ from the roebuck
in the &s;ub&s;tance of their horns. Tho&s;e of the
roebuck are a kind of &s;olid <HI>wood,</HI> which falls off
and is renewed annually, like that of the &s;tag.
The horns of the antilopes, on the contrary, are
hollow and permanent, like tho&s;e of the goat.
Be&s;ides, the roebuck has no gall-bladder. The
antilopes, as well as the roebucks, have hollows
before the eyes. They re&s;emble each other &s;till
more in the quality of the hair, in the white|ne&s;s
of the buttocks, and in the tufts on their
legs; but, in the roebuck, the&s;e tufts are on the
hind-legs, and on the fore legs of the antilopes

when it is con&s;idered that the roebuck exi&s;ts e|qually
in both Continents, and that the goats,
as well as the antilopes, are peculiar to the Old
World, we are led to think, that the goats and
antilopes are more allied to each other than they
are to the roebuck. Be&s;ides, the only characters
peculiar to the antilopes are the tran&s;ver&s;e rings

proceeds not from a difference of &s;ex; for, in
both males and females, the horns of the one
&s;pecies are round, and of the other flat. In every
other article, the re&s;emblance is complete. The
kevel, like the gazelle, has &s;hort yellow hair,
white belly and thighs, a black tail, a brown

thinner, &s;horter, and &s;moother, the rings which
encircle them being hardly perceptible. M.
Adan&s;on, who communicated to me his de&s;crip|tion
of this animal, &s;ays, that it appeared to par|take
&s;omewhat of the chamois goat, but that it
was much &s;maller, being only two feet and a
half long, and le&s;s than two feet high; that his
ears are four inches and a half in length, the tail
three inches, the horns &s;ix inches long, and on|ly
half an inch thick; that they are two inches
a&s;under at the ba&s;e, and from five to &s;ix at their
extremities; that, in&s;tead of rings, they have cir|cular
<HI>rugae,</HI> very near each other in the inferior
part, and more di&s;tant in the &s;uperior; that the&s;e
<HI>rugae,</HI> which hold the place of rings, are about
&s;ixteen in number; that the hair of this animal,
which is &s;hort, &s;hining, and clo&s;e &s;et, is yellow
on the back and flanks, white on the belly and

the in&s;ide of the thighs; that the tail is black;
and that, in the &s;ame &s;pecies, &s;ome individuals
have white &s;pots &s;cattered over their bodies
without any order.</P>
<P>The&s;e differences between the gazelle, the
kevel, and the corine, though very con&s;picuous,
&s;eem to be neither e&s;&s;ential, nor &s;ufficient to
make the&s;e animals three di&s;tinct &s;pecies. In
every other re&s;pect, they re&s;emble each other &s;o
&s;trongly, that they appear to be of the &s;ame &s;pe|cies,
varied a little by the influence of climate
and food; for the kevel and gazelle differ le&s;s
from one another than from the corine, who&s;e
horns re&s;emble not tho&s;e of the other two. But
all the three have the &s;ame natural habits; they
go in troops, a&s;&s;ociate together, and feed in the
&s;ame manner; their di&s;po&s;itions are gentle; they
are ea&s;ily accu&s;tomed to a dome&s;tic &s;tate; and
their fle&s;h makes excellent eating. We may,
therefore, conclude, that the gazelle and kevel
certainly belong to the &s;ame &s;pecies, and that it
is doubtful whether the corine be a variety only
of the &s;ame, or really con&s;titutes a di&s;tinct
&s;pecies.</P>

that it ought to be regarded as a di&s;tinct &s;pecies.
The pits below the eyes are larger in the <HI>anti|lope</HI>

fourteen inches long; and, though they al|mo&s;t

le&s;s rai&s;ed than tho&s;e of the gazelle and ke|vel;
and, what is peculiar to the <HI>antilope,</HI> its
horns have a remarkably beautiful double flexion,
which gives them the appearance of the antient
lyre. The hair of the <HI>antilope,</HI> like that of the

three varieties of the &s;ame &s;pecies; 2. That
the tzeiran, koba, and kob, are varieties of ano|ther
&s;pecies; 3. That the algazel and pa&s;an are
probably two varieties of the &s;ame &s;pecies; and
that the name of <HI>bezoar gazelle,</HI> which has been

for I &s;hall afterwards prove, that the Oriental
bezoar is not produced by the pa&s;an alone,
but by all the gazelles and goats which inhabit
the mountains of A&s;ia; 4. That the nanguers,

there are two or three varieties, have been point|ed

5. That the <HI>antilopes,</HI> which are three or four

<P>It is now ea&s;y to perceive the difficulty of ar|ranging

which are thirty in number, ten goats, twelve or
thirteen antilopes, three or four bubali, and as
many mu&s;ks. Many of them were unknown
to the naturali&s;ts, or exhibited in promi&s;cuous
groups; and the whole have been confounded
with each other by travellers. This, indeed, is
the third time I have written the hi&s;tory of

labour overbalances the produce. I have the
&s;atisfaction, however, of having made every
po&s;&s;ible u&s;e of the knowledge and materials I
could acquire.</P>
<P>With regard to the gazelles, from comparing
all that has been &s;aid of them, both by the an|tients
<PB N="417" REF="469">
and moderns, with our own experience,
we find, 1. That the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> of Ari&s;totle is not the
gazelle, but the roebuck; though the &s;ame word
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> has been employed by Aelian, not only
to denote the wild goats in general, but parti|cularly
the Lybian gazelle or Barbary antilope;
2. That the <HI>&s;trep&s;iceros</HI> of Pliny, or <HI>addax</HI> of
the Africans, is the <HI>antilope;</HI> 3. That the <HI>da|ma</HI>
of Pliny is the <HI>nanguer</HI> of Africa, and not
our fallow deer, or any other European animal;
4. That the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> of Ari&s;totle is the &s;ame with the
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> of Aelian, and the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> of the more mo|dern
Greeks; and that the Latins have u&s;ed this
word <HI>platyceros</HI> to denote the fallow deer;
&startq;animalium,&endq; &s;ays Pliny, &startq;quorundam cornua
in palmas finxit natura, digito&s;que emi&s;it ex
iis, unde <HI>platycerotas</HI> vocant;&endq; 5. That the
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> of the Greeks is probably the Egyptian
or Per&s;ian gazelle, that is, the <HI>algazel</HI> or <HI>pa&s;an.</HI>
The word <HI>pygargus</HI> is employed by Ari&s;totle
&s;olely to denote the <HI>white tailed eagle;</HI> and Pliny
has u&s;ed the &s;ame word to denote a quadruped.
Now, the etymology of <HI>pygargus</HI> indicates, 1.
An animal with white thighs, &s;uch as the roe|bucks,
or gazelles; 2. A timid animal; the an|tients,
imagining that white thighs indicated ti|midity,
a&s;cribed the intrepidity of Hercules to
his having black thighs. But, as almo&s;t all the
authors who &s;peak of the <HI>pygargus</HI> as a qua|druped,
mention likewi&s;e the roebuck, it is ob|vious,
that the name <HI>pygargus</HI> can only apply
<PB N="418" REF="470">
to &s;ome &s;pecies of gazelle different from the
<HI>dorcas Lybica,</HI> or common gazelle, and from the
<HI>&s;trep&s;iceros</HI> or <HI>antilope,</HI> which are al&s;o mentioned
by the &s;ame authors. We are, therefore, led to
conclude, that the <HI>pygargus</HI> denotes the algazel
or Egyptian gazelle, which mu&s;t have been
known to the Greeks as well as the Hebrews;
for we find the name <HI>pygargus</HI> applied, in the
Septuagint ver&s;ion<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Deutron. chap. 14.</NOTE>, to a quadruped which is rec|koned
among the pure animals who&s;e fle&s;h might
be eaten. Hence the Jews eat the <HI>pygargus,</HI> or
that &s;pecies of gazelle which is mo&s;t common in
Egypt and the adjacent countries.</P>
<P>Dr Ru&s;&s;el, in his Natural Hi&s;tory of Aleppo,
tells us, that, in the neighbourhood of that city,
there are two kinds of gazelles. The one, called
the <HI>mountain gazelle,</HI> which is the mo&s;t beauti|ful,
and who&s;e hair on the neck and back is of a
deep brown colour; the other, called <HI>the gazelle
of the plains,</HI> which is neither &s;o nimble, nor &s;o
hand&s;ome as the fir&s;t, and who&s;e hair is of a
pale colour. He adds, that the&s;e animals are &s;o
&s;wift, and run &s;o long, that the be&s;t hounds
cannot take them, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a
falcon; that, though the gazelles are meager in
winter, their fle&s;h is excellent; that, in &s;ummer,
it is loaded with fat like that of the fallow deer;
that tho&s;e fed in hou&s;es are not &s;uch good
eating as the wild ones, &amp;c. From the te&s;timo|nies

<P>This is larger, &s;wifter, and wilder, than the common rock goat, and can &s;carcely be taken without a falcon. It is met with near Aleppo. I have &s;een a variety of this, which is common in the Ea&s;t, and the horns appear different; per|haps it is a di&s;tinct &s;pecies. This animal loves the &s;moke of tobacco, and, when caught alive, will approach the pipe of the hunt&s;man, though otherwi&s;e more timid than any animal. This is perhaps the only creature, be&s;ide man, that delights in the &s;mell of a poi&s;onous and &s;tinking plant. The Arabians hunt it with a falcon (Falco gentilis, Linn.) I had an ex|cellent opportunity of &s;eeing this &s;port near Nazareth, in Ga|lilee. An Arab, mounting a &s;wift cour&s;er, held the falcon on his hand, as hunt&s;men commonly do: When we e&s;pied the rock goat, on the top of a mountain, he let loo&s;e the falcon, which flew in a direct line, like an arrow, and attacked the ani|mal, fixing the talons of one of his feet, into the cheek of the creature, and the talons of the other into its throat, extend|ing his wings obliquely over the animal; &s;preading one to|wards one of its ears, and the other to the oppo&s;ite hip. The animal, thus attacked, made a leap twice the height of a man, and freed him&s;elf from the falcon; but, being wounded, and lo&s;ing its &s;trength and &s;peed, it was again attacked by the falcon, which fixed the talons of both its feet into the throat of the animal, and held it fad, till the hunt&s;man coming up, took it alive, and cut its throat; the falcon drinking the blood, as a reward for his labour; and a young falcon, which was learning, was likewi&s;e put to the throat of the goat; by this means are young falcons taught to fix their talons in the throat of the animal, as being the propere&s;t part; for, &s;hould the falcon &s;ix them in the creature's hip, or &s;ome other part of the body, the hunt&s;man would not only lo&s;e his game, but his falcon al&s;o: For the animal, rou&s;ed by the wound, which could not prove mortal, would run to the de&s;erts, and the tops of the mountains, whither its enemy keeping its hold, would be obliged to follow; and, being &s;eparated from its ma&s;ter, mu&s;t of cour&s;e peri&s;h; <HI>Ha&s;&s;elqui&s;t, p.</HI> 190.</P></NOTE>, we learn

They generally go in &s;eparate flocks, each con&s;i&s;ting of five or &s;ix, and accompanied with a male, who is ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed by his colour. When the hunters di&s;cover one of the&s;e flocks, they endeavour to point them out to the leopard, which they keep chained in a &s;mall cart. This cunning animal does not run &s;traight upon them, but winds about, creeping and concealing him&s;elf, in order to approach and &s;urpri&s;e them; and, as he is capable of ma|king five or &s;ix bounds with inconceivable quickne&s;s, when he thinks him&s;elf near enough, he darts upon them, tears open the throat and brea&s;t, and gluts him&s;elf with their blood, heart, and liver. But, if he mi&s;&s;es his aim, which often happens, he remains fixed on the &s;pot. It would be in vain to attempt to &s;eize them by running; for they run much &s;wifter and con|tinue much longer than he can do. His ma&s;ter then comes gently up to him, flatters him, and throw pieces of fle&s;h to him. By amu&s;ing the animal in this manner, he is enabled to throw a cover over his eyes: After which, he chains him, and replaces him on the cart. In the cour&s;e of our march, one of the&s;e leopards exhibited this &s;port to us, which alarm|ed &s;everal of our people. A flock of gazelles ro&s;e in the mid&s;t of the army, and, as often happens, they accidentally pa&s;|&s;ed near the two leopards, which are commonly carried a|long on a &s;mall cart. One of them, which was not hood|winked, made &s;uch a &s;pring, that he broke his chain, and darted after them, but without effect. However, as the ga|zelles were terrified, and chaced on all &s;ides, one of them was again obliged to pa&s;s near the leopard, who, notwith&s;tanding the whole road was embara&s;&s;ed with camels and hor&s;es, and notwith&s;tanding the common notion that this animal never attacks its prey after having once mi&s;&s;ed it, he &s;prung upon, and &s;eized it; <HI>Relat. de Thevenot, tom. 3. p.</HI> 112.</NOTE>, which we have called <HI>ounce.</HI> In &s;ome

animal which produces the <HI>Oriental bezoar</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">At Golconda, the King has great &s;tore of excellent be|zoars. The mountains where the goats feed which produce the&s;e &s;tones, are about &s;even or eight days journey from Bag|nagaar. They commonly &s;ell at forty crowns a pound; and the longe&s;t kind are the be&s;t. They are likewi&s;e found in certain cows, which are much larger, though not &s;o valuable as tho&s;e produced by the goats. The bezoars extracted from a rare kind of apes, which are &s;mall and long, are in the highe&s;t e&s;timation; <HI>Voyage de Thevenot, tom. 3. p.</HI> 293.&mdash;Per|&s;ia produces finer Bezoar &s;tones than any other country of the world. They are extracted from the &s;ides of certain wild he goats, to the livers of which they are attached; <HI>Voyage de Feynes, p.</HI> 44.&mdash;The bezoar, that famous medicinal &s;tone, ought to be ranked among the number of drugs. It is a ten|der &s;tone, con|&s;i&s;ting of coats or pellicles, like an onion. It is found in the bodies of the wild and dome&s;tic goats along the gulf of Per&s;ia, in the province of Cora&s;&s;on, which is the an|tient Margiana, and is incomparably better than that brought from the kingdom of Golconda. But, as the goats were brought from a di&s;tance of three days journey, we found be|zoars in &s;ome of them only, and even that in &s;mall quantities. We pre&s;erved the&s;e goats alive fifteen days. They were fed with common green herbage; but, upon opening them, no|thing was found. I kept them during this time, in order to di&s;cover whether, as is alledged, it be a particular herb which heats the&s;e ani|mal, and produces this &s;tone in their bodies. We are told by the natives of Per&s;ia, that the more this animal pa&s;tures in parched countries, and eats dry and aromatic herbs, the bezoar is the more &s;alutary. Cora&s;&s;on and the bor|ders of the Per&s;ian gulf are the drie&s;t countries in the world. In the heart of the&s;e &s;tones, there are always pieces of brambles, or &s;ome other vegetable, that &s;erve as a nucleus, round which the humour that compo&s;es this &s;tone coagulates. It is wor|thy of remark, that, in India, the &s;he-goats produce bezoar, and that, in Per&s;ia, it is produced by the wedders and he-goats. The Per&s;ians e&s;teem their own bezoar, being hotter and better concocted, as four times more valuable than the In|dian kind. The former they &s;ell at fifty-four livres the kou|rag, which is a weight of three drachms; <HI>Voyage de Chardin, tom. 2. p.</HI> 16.&mdash;The oriental bezoar comes from a northern province of the kingdom of Golconda, and is found in the &s;tomach of &s;he-goats.&mdash;The pea&s;ants, by feeling the belly of the goat, know how many bezoars &s;he has, and &s;ell her in proportion to their number. This number they di&s;|cover, by rubbing the &s;ides of the &s;tomach with their hands in &s;uch a manner as to bring all the contents towards the middle of it, and then they feel the &s;tones di&s;tinctly.&mdash;The bezoar, like the diamond, is valued according to its &s;ize; for, if five or &s;ix bezoars weigh an ounce, they bring from fif|teen to eighteen francs. But, if one bezoar weighs an ounce, it &s;ells at one hundred francs. I &s;old one of four ounces and a half at two thou&s;and livres.&mdash;The merchants who traffic in bezoars, brought me &s;ix of the&s;e goats, which I exa|mined. It mu&s;t be acknowledged that the&s;e animals are beautiful, very tall, and have hair as fine as &s;ilk.&mdash;I was told that one of the&s;e goats had but one bezoar in its &s;to|mach, and that others had two, three, or four, which I &s;oon perceived to be true by rubbing their bellies in the manner above de&s;cribed. The&s;e &s;ix goats had &s;eventeen bezoars and a half, one of which was about the &s;ize of half a hazel nut. The in&s;ide re&s;embled the &s;oft dung of a goat. The&s;e &s;tones grow among the dung in the animal's belly. Some of the natives told me, that the bezoars were attached to the liver, and others, that they were fixed to the heart. From the&s;e vagne a&s;&s;ertions, I could not learn the truth.&mdash;With regard to the bezoar produced by the ape, it is &s;o &s;trong that two grains of it are reckoned equal to fix of that produced by the goat; but it is very rare, and is found principally in the i&s;land of Maca&s;&s;ar. This kind of bezoar is round; but the other is of different figures. The&s;e bezoars which are &s;uppo&s;ed to come from the apes, are much rarer than the o|ther kind. They are al&s;o much dearer, and in greater re|que&s;t; and, when one is found of the &s;ize of a nut, it &s;ome|times &s;ells at more than a hundred crowns; <HI>Voyage de Taver|nier, tom. 4. p.</HI> 78.</NOTE>.

But this notion of Rumphius and Seba is by
<PB N="430" REF="482">
no means well founded. We have &s;een &s;eve|ral
of the&s;e concretions, which are called <HI>ape
bezoars.</HI> But they are totally different from the
oriental bezoar, which unque&s;tionably proceeds
from a ruminating animal, and is ea&s;ily di&s;tin|gui&s;hed,
by its form and &s;ub&s;tance, from all the
other bezoars. Its common colour is a greeni&s;h
olive, and browni&s;h within. The colour of
what is called the <HI>occidental bezoar,</HI> is a faint
yellow, more or le&s;s dirty. The &s;ub&s;tance
of the former is more tender and porous,
and that of the latter, harder, drier, and more
petrified. Be&s;ides, as prodigious quantities of
the oriental bezoar were con&s;umed during the
la&s;t two or three centuries, being u&s;ed, both in
Europe and A&s;ia, in all ca&s;es where our phy&s;i|cians
<PB N="431" REF="483">
now employ cordials and antidotes again&s;t
poi&s;on, may we not pre&s;ume, from this great
con&s;umption, which &s;till continues in &s;ome de|gree,
that the bezoar proceeds from a very com|mon
animal, or rather, that it proceeds not from
one, but from &s;everal &s;pecies; and that it is
equally extracted from gazelles, goats, and wed|ders;
but that the&s;e animals can only produce
it in the climates of India and the Levant?</P>
<P>From all that has been written on this &s;ub|ject,
we have not been able to find one di&s;tinct
ob&s;ervation, nor a &s;ingle deci&s;ive argument. It
only appears, from what has been &s;aid by Mo|nard,
Garcias, Clu&s;ius, Aldrovandus, Hernandes,
&amp;c. that the oriental bezoar animal is not the
common dome&s;tic goat, but a &s;pecies of wild
goat, which they have not &s;ufficiently characte|ri&s;ed.
In the &s;ame manner, all we can collect
from Koempfer is, that the bezoar animal is a
kind of wild goat, or rather gazelle, which is e|qually
ill de&s;cribed. But, from the te&s;timonies
of Thevenot, Chardin, and Tavernier, we learn,
that this &s;tone is not &s;o often extracted from the
gazelles, as from the wedders, and the wild or
dome&s;tic goats. The&s;e travellers merit the great|er
credit, becau&s;e they were eye-witne&s;&s;es to the
facts they mention, and becau&s;e, when treating
of the bezoar, though they take no notice of the
gazelles, yet, as they were well acquainted with
the&s;e animals, and mention them in other parts
of their works<NOTE N="&ast;" TYPE="foot">Voyage de Tavernier, tom. 2. p. 26.</NOTE>, there is not the lea&s;t appearance
<PB N="432" REF="484">
of their having been deceived. We mu&s;t not,
therefore, conclude, like our antient naturali&s;ts,
that the oriental bezoar is produced &s;olely by a
particular &s;pecies of gazelle. I acknowledge, that,
after having examined not only the evidence of
travellers, but the facts them&s;elves which might
decide this que&s;tion, I am inclined to believe that
the bezoar &s;tone proceeds equally from the mo&s;t
part of ruminating animals, but more common|ly
from goats and gazelles. It is formed of con|centric
coats or &s;trata, and frequently contains
foreign &s;ub&s;tances in its centre. I endeavoured to
inve&s;tigate the nature of the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances, which
&s;erve as a nucleus to the bezoar, in order to di&s;|cover
the animal that &s;wallowed them. In the
centre of the&s;e &s;tones I found &s;mall flints, &s;tones
of plums, and of tamarinds, &s;eeds of ca&s;|&s;ia,
and e&s;pecially pieces of &s;traw and buds of
trees. Hence I could no longer he&s;itate in at|tributing
this production to animals which brou&s;e
herbage and leaves.</P>
<P>We are per&s;uaded, therefore, that the oriental
bezoar proceeds not from any one, but from a
number of different animals. Neither is it diffi|cult
to reconcile this opinion with the te&s;timo|nies
of travellers; for, though each of them
contradicts his neighbour; yet all of them make
near approaches to the truth. The bezoar was
unknown to the antient Greeks and Latins.
Galen is the fir&s;t who mentions its virtues a|gain&s;t
poi&s;on. The Arabians &s;peak of the be|zoar
<PB N="433" REF="485">
as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the &s;ame virtues. But neither
the Greeks, Latins, nor Arabians, give any pre|ci&s;e
information concerning the animals by which
it is produced. Rabi Mo&s;es, the Egyptian, only
remarks, that &s;ome people pretend that this &s;tone
is formed in the angle of the eye, and others in
the gall-bladder of the Ea&s;tern wedders. Now,
bezoars, or concretions, are actually formed
in the angles of the eyes, and in the pits be|low
the eyes of &s;tags and &s;ome other ani|mals.
But the&s;e concretions are very different
from the oriental bezoar; and all the concre|tions
in the gall-bladder con&s;i&s;t of a light, oily,
and inflammable matter, which has no re&s;em|blance
to the &s;ub&s;tance of the bezoar. Andreas
Lacuna, a Spani&s;h phy&s;ician, in his commenta|ries
on Dio&s;corides, remarks, that the oriental
bezoar is extracted from a certain &s;pecies of wild
goat in the mountains of Per&s;ia. Amatus Lu&s;i|tanus
repeats Lacuna's remark; and adds, that
this mountain goat re&s;embles the &s;tag. Monard,
who quotes all the three, a&s;&s;ures us in a more
po&s;itive manner, that this &s;tone is derived from
the internal parts of a mountain goat in India, to
which, &s;ays he, I may give the appellation of
<HI>cervi-capra;</HI> becau&s;e it partakes both of the &s;tag
and the goat, is nearly of the &s;ize and figure
of the &s;tag, and, like the goat, has &s;imple horns,
very much bended backward<NOTE N="&ast;" TYPE="foot">Lapis <HI>Bez&aacute;ar</HI> varias habet appellationes; nam Arabibits <HI>Hager</HI> dicitur, Per&s;is <HI>Bez&aacute;ar,</HI> Indis <HI>Bezar,...</HI> I&s;te lapis in in|ternis partibus cuju&s;dam animalis <HI>Capra montana</HI> appellati generatur.....

without offering any thing new. In fine,
to omit nothing relative to the hi&s;tory of this
&s;tone, Koempfer, an intelligent man, and an ex|act
ob&s;erver, tells us, that, when in the province
of Laar in Per&s;ia, he went with the natives of
the country to hunt the buck <HI>pa&s;an,</HI> which pro|duces
the bezoar; and that he &s;aw the &s;tone
extracted; and he a&s;&s;ures us, that the true ori|ental
bezoar proceeds from this animal; that the
buck <HI>ahu,</HI> of which he al&s;o gives a figure, like|wi&s;e
produces bezoar, but that it is of an inferior
quality. From the figures he has given of the
pa&s;on and ahu, we would be induced to think,
that the fir&s;t repre&s;ents the common gazelle rather
than the true pa&s;an; and, from his de&s;cription,
we &s;hould imagine his pa&s;an to be a he-goat,
and not a gazelle, becau&s;e he has given it a beard
like the goats. La&s;tly, from the name <HI>ahu,</HI>
which he gives to his other buck, as well as from
his &s;econd figure, we recogni&s;e the wild he-goat
rather than the genuine ahu, which is our tzeiran
or large gazelle. What is &s;till more &s;ingular,
Koempfer, who &s;eems willing to determine the
&s;pecies of the oriental bezoar animal, and who
a&s;&s;ures us that it is the wild buck called <HI>pa&s;an,</HI>
quotes, at the &s;ame time, a man who, he &s;ays,
is very worthy of credit, and who affirms, that
he felt the bezoars in the belly of the gazelle, at
Golconda. Thus, all the po&s;itive evidence which
can be derived from Koempfer is reduced to this,
that there are two &s;pecies of wild mountain-goats,
<PB N="437" REF="489">
the pa&s;an and ahu, which produce the bezoar in
Per&s;ia, and that in India this &s;tone is likewi&s;e
found in the gazelles. Chardin remarks, that the
oriental bezoar is found in the bucks and &s;he-goats,
both wild and dome&s;tic, along the Per&s;ic
Gulf, and in &s;everal provinces of India; but that,
in Per&s;ia, it is al&s;o extracted from the wedders.
The Dutch travellers al&s;o a&s;&s;ert<NOTE N="&ast;" TYPE="foot">In the i&s;land of Bo&s;ner, we find the famous bezoar &s;tone, which is very precious and in great reque&s;t, on account of its virtue again&s;t poi&s;on.

A conjecture has been formed, that the bezoar which proceeds from the &s;tomach of the &s;heep, and the gall-bladder &s;tone of the hog, are produced by the operation of &s;ome particu|lar herbs eaten by the&s;e animals. But they are found in all the countries of the Ea&s;t-Indies, though the&s;e animals feed promi&s;cuou&s;ly upon herbage of every kind. <HI>See Voyage de la Compagn. des Indes de Hollande, tom. 2. p.</HI> 121. and al&s;o <HI>Le Voy|age de Mandel&s;lo tom. 2. p.</HI> 364.</NOTE>, that it is pro|duced
in the &s;tomachs of &s;heep and goats. Ta|vernier,
who is &s;till more po&s;itive in favour of
the dome&s;tic goats, &s;ays, that their hair is as fine
as &s;ilk, and that, having purcha&s;ed &s;ix of the&s;e
goats alive, he extracted from them &s;eventeen
entire bezoars, and a piece of another as large
as half a filbered nut. He then adds, that there
are other bezoars &s;uppo&s;ed to proceed from apes,
who&s;e virtues are &s;till &s;tronger than tho&s;e of the
goat-bezoars; that they are al&s;o extracted from
cows; but the virtues of the&s;e are inferior, &amp;c.
What can be inferred from this variety of evi|dence
and opinions, unle&s;s it be allowed that the
<PB N="438" REF="490">
oriental bezoar proceeds not from one &s;pecies,
but from a number of different animals, and e&s;pe|cially
from the gazelles and goats?</P>
<P>With regard to the occidental bezoars, we he|&s;itate
not to pronounce, that they are produced
neither by goats nor gazelles; for it will be &s;hown,
in the &s;ub&s;equent articles, that there are neither
goats, gazelles, nor even any animal which ap|proaches
to this genus, throughout the whole
extent of the New World. In&s;tead of gazelles,
we find roebucks alone in the woods of Ameri|ca;
in&s;tead of wild goats and &s;heep, lamas and
pacos<NOTE N="&ast;" TYPE="foot"><HI>See vol. V. art.</HI> Of the animals peculiar to the New Con|tinent.</NOTE>, animals totally different, are to be
found in the mountains of Peru and Chili. The
antient Peruvians had no other cattle; and, at
the &s;ame time that the&s;e two &s;pecies were partly
reduced to a dome&s;tic &s;tate, they exi&s;ted, in &s;till
greater numbers, in their natural condition of
liberty on the mountains. The wild lamas were
called <HI>huanacus,</HI> and the pacos <HI>vicunnas,</HI> from
which has been derived the name <HI>vigogne,</HI> that
denotes the &s;ame animal with the pacos. Both
the lamas and the pacos produce bezoars; but
the dome&s;tic kind produce them more rarely than
the wild.</P>
<P>M. Daubenton, who has inve&s;tigated the na|ture
of bezoar &s;tones more clo&s;ely than any other
per&s;on, thinks that they are compo&s;ed of the
&s;ame matter as that &s;hining coloured tartar which
<PB N="439" REF="491">
adheres to the teeth of ruminating animals;
and it appears, from the numerous collection
of bezoars in the royal cabinet, that there
are e&s;&s;ential differences between the oriental
and occidental bezoars. Hence the goats of

and large &s;erpents, produce bezoars<NOTE N="&ast;" TYPE="foot">There is another &s;tone, called the <HI>&s;tone of the hooded &s;erpent,</HI> a &s;pecies of &s;erpent which has a kind of hood hanging behind its head.... and, behind this hood, the &s;tone is found, the &s;malle&s;t being as large as a hen's egg..... The&s;e &s;erpents frequent the coa&s;ts of Melinda, and the &s;tones might be brought by the Portugue&s;e &s;ailors or &s;oldiers, when they return from Mo&s;amb que; <HI>Voyage de Tavernier, tom. 4. p.</HI> 80.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="441" REF="493">
To obtain a clear idea of the&s;e concretions,
they mu&s;t be di&s;tributed into &s;everal cla&s;&s;es, re|ferring
to the animals which produce them, and
the climates and food that are favourable to their
production.</P>
<P>1. The &s;tones formed in the bladder and kid|neys
of men and other animals mu&s;t be &s;epa|rated
from the cla&s;s of bezoars, and denominated
by the appellation of <HI>calculi,</HI> their &s;ub&s;tance be|ing
totally different from that of the bezoars.
They are ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed by their weight,
their urinous odour, and their &s;tructure, which
is neither regular, nor compo&s;ed of thin con|centric
circles, like that of the bezoars.</P>
<P>2. The concretions &s;ometimes found in the
gall-bladder and liver of men and animals &s;hould
not be regarded as bezoars. They may be di|&s;tingui&s;hed
by their lightne&s;s, their colour, and
their inflammability; be&s;ides, they are not form|ed
of concentric circles round a nucleus.</P>
<P>3. The balls frequently found in the &s;tomachs
of animals, and e&s;pecially of the ruminating kinds,
are not true bezoars. The&s;e balls, which are
called <HI>Aegagropili,</HI> are compo&s;ed, internally, of
hairs &s;wallowed by the animal when licking it&s;elf,
or of hard roots which it was unable to dige&s;t;
and, externally, mo&s;t of them are covered with
a vi&s;cid &s;ub&s;tance, which has &s;ome re&s;emblance
to bezoar. Hence the <HI>aegagropili</HI> have nothing
in common with the bezoars but this external
<PB N="442" REF="494">
covering; and in&s;pection alone is &s;ufficient to
di&s;tingui&s;h the one from the other.</P>
<P>4. In temperate climates, we often find <HI>ae|gagropili</HI>
in animals, but never bezoars. Our
oxen and cows, the Alpine chamois<NOTE N="&ast;" TYPE="foot">See note at p. 439.</NOTE>, and the
Italian porcupine<NOTE N="&dagger;" TYPE="foot">We found an aegagropilus in a porcupine &s;ent us from Rome in the year 1763.</NOTE>, produce only <HI>aegagropili.</HI>
The animals of hot countries, on the contrary,
yield only bezoars. The elephant, the rhino|ceros,
the goats and gazelles of A&s;ia and Africa,
the lama of Peru, &amp;c. in&s;tead of <HI>aegagropili,</HI>
produce &s;olid bezoars, who&s;e &s;ize and con&s;i&s;tence
vary according to the animals and the climates
under which they live.</P>
<P>5. The bezoars, to which &s;o many virtues
have been a&s;cribed, are the oriental kind, and
they are produced by the goats, gazelles, and
&s;heep, that inhabit the high mountains of A&s;ia.
Bezoars of an inferior quality, which are called
<HI>occidental,</HI> proceed from the lamas and pacas
who are found in the mountains of South Ame|rica.
In fine, the goats and gazelles of Africa
likewi&s;e yield bezoars; but they are not &s;o good
as tho&s;e of A&s;ia.</P>
<P>From all the&s;e facts we may conclude, in ge|neral,
that the bezoars are only a re&s;idue of
vegetable nouri&s;hment, which exi&s;ts not in car|nivorous
animals, and is peculiar to tho&s;e who
live upon plants; that, in the &s;outhern moun|tains
of A&s;ia, the herbs being &s;tronger and more

exalted than in any other region of the world,
the bezoars, which are the re&s;idue of them, are
al&s;o &s;uperior in quality to all others; that, in
America, where the heat is le&s;s inten&s;e, and the
mountain herbs have not &s;o much &s;trength, the
bezoars which proceed from them are al&s;o great|ly
inferior; and, la&s;tly, that, in Europe, where
the herbs are feeble, and in the plains of both
continents, where they are gro&s;s, no bezoars are
produced, but only <HI>aegagropili,</HI> which contain
nothing but hairs, roots, or filaments that are
too hard to be dige&s;ted.</P>
