<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THIS Work may, perhaps, re|mind
the Reader of Two Vo|lumes
which have appeared in
the World under the &s;ame Ti|tle;
but they are de&s;ired to ob&s;erve, to
prevent Mi&s;takes, that tho&s;e Volumes en|joy
nothing of the Subject of this Work,
but the meer Title; nor is there the lea&s;t
Similitude between them.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="3">
What tho&s;e Books contain is none of our
Bu&s;ine&s;s here, and this Work will &s;peak
for it &s;elf.</P>
<P>The In&s;tructor here is the Ma&s;ter of
a Family, who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s and Duty is to
inform and confirm his Children in
right Principles; How he di&s;charges
the paternal Obligation, will appear in the
very fir&s;t Entrance: The Work has a
double A&s;pect;</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The <HI>Example</HI> from the Father <HI>in|&s;tructing:</HI>
This, indeed, is of the la&s;t Im|portance
to Parents, and Heads of Fa|milies,
as it is a Pattern pre&s;ented for
their Imitation; and &s;o it is an In&s;truction
to Fathers, as well as a Father's In&s;truc|tion
to Children: I could be glad to &s;ay
that Part was le&s;s u&s;eful than the re&s;t; but
by how much the Example is wanting, by
<PB N="v" REF="4">
&s;o much the Work will be the more va|luable.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The other Face of this Work re&s;pects
the Children <HI>In&s;tructed;</HI> and there the
Example of a &s;ober, well-taught, and re|ligiou&s;ly
educated Family is very particu|lar;
&s;hewing how receptive &s;uch are of
farther In&s;truction: Such drink in Know|ledge
as a Fi&s;h drinks in Water, <HI>viz.</HI> for
Life; receiving it as Infants &s;uck their
Mothers Milk, with Plea&s;ure and De|light.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The Children here are brought in eager
to know, willing to be in&s;tructed; de|&s;iring
their Father to inform them of the
Principles, and of the Mi&s;takes too, of
the Religious Part of the World. It is
true, that Parents are under unque&s;tioned
Obligations to teach and in&s;truct their
Children; but I will not &s;ay that no Pa|rents
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
want Helps to quicken them to the
Work, as well as to enable them to per|form
It; here we &s;hall find both.</P>
<P>Some Parents would in&s;truct their
Children; if they knew how; I doubt
more neglect it that do know how. There
&s;eems to be more Reluctance to the Work
to an&s;wer for, than Ignorance how to
perform it; e&s;pecially in this enlighten'd
Age, and this in&s;tructed Part of the
World. 'Tis hard we &s;hould prompt
Children to prompt their Parents to in|&s;truct
Them; but I believe this may pa&s;s
for a Truth in mo&s;t of our Families, that
if Children would be more bu&s;y enquiring
of their Parents, they would all be
better in&s;tructed than they are. No
Wonder whole Families are ignorant and
dark, when the Parents are as back|ward
to teach, as their Children are to
be taught.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="6">
It is a fad Reproof to a Parent,
when the want of his in&s;tructing his
Children di&s;covers it&s;elf fir&s;t to him by
their Ignorance: It was a &s;aucy, but a
melancholy Return, which I once heard a
Child make to his Father, for calling him
Fool, <HI>viz. That he &s;hould have been
wi&s;er, if</HI> his Father <HI>had taught him
better.</HI></P>
<P>The Children here are repre&s;ented in|quiring
and asking Que&s;tions, not of a
Father unable or unwilling to in&s;truct
Them, but as guiding the Father's Di&s;|cour&s;es
to that in particular which they
&s;tood mo&s;t in need of being in&s;tructed in;
&s;uch Inquiry is a Part of their own In|&s;truction,
and a Guide to their In&s;tructor
al&s;o; for they fir&s;t &s;hew the Father what
it is they &s;tand in more than ordinary Oc|ca&s;ion
of being taught, and he turns his
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
Di&s;cour&s;e accordingly; &s;o they direct him
how to in&s;truct them.</P>
<P>Thus it will always he where the
Family is compleatly in&s;tructed, and apt
for In&s;truction; and 'tis a happy Con|junction
for Improvement, where a Parent
in&s;tructing, is led by the Inquiries of his
Children to that particular Part of In|&s;truction
which they mo&s;t want.</P>
<P>The Points of In&s;truction which take
up this Work, intimate, that the Children
were not too young to be talked with upon
the mo&s;t nice and difficult Points of
Religion, and yet were not too old to he
taught; and in particular, did not think
them&s;elves too old for Teaching, or too
wi&s;e to learn.</P>
<P>'Tis one of the wor&s;t Parts of Folly,
when Children think they need no Teach|ing.
<PB N="ix" REF="8">
It is the Character of the Bruti&s;h
only, that he <HI>hates In&s;truction,</HI> Prov.
xii. 1. Nothing can be farther off from
Wi&s;dom, than he that thinks him&s;elf above
being wi&s;er. The conceited Man is ge|nerally
the ignorant Man; he that is
humble is always teachable; and he knows
very little that &s;corns to increa&s;e his
Knowledge; 'tis a prepo&s;terous Pride,
and has both the Folly and the Vice: A
Man ought no more to de&s;pi&s;e being
made wi&s;er, than he &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e his
being made richer, which very few incline
to.</P>
<P>But not to dwell upon that fa&s;hionable
Madne&s;s; the Family I am to bring up|on
the Stage, is the Rever&s;e of it: Here
is the Father ready to in&s;truct, and the
Children willing to be in&s;tructed; both
valuable Examples, and both in&s;tructive
<PB N="x" REF="9">
in their Kind, as well to Fathers as to
Children, and both intended to be &s;o.</P>
<P>I have nothing to apologize for, in the
Plainne&s;s and Deficiency of the In&s;tructi|on;
every Thing here is &s;uited to the Ca|pacity
of Children, and therein an&s;wers
the End it is de&s;igned for. There might,
no doubt, be more &s;aid to the Subject, and
farther Explanations be given of the Points
di&s;cour&s;ed of, nor does the Author think
he boa&s;ts, an &s;aying he could have &s;aid
more upon the &s;ame Heads.</P>
<P>But Nece&s;&s;ity, and the &s;everal Cir|cum&s;tances
of Things an&s;wer for him in
mo&s;t, if not all the Ca&s;es, where &s;uch
Objection would otherwi&s;e lie again&s;t
him.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Want of Room: The Work is pre&s;crib'd
in Bulk, and could not exceed, with|out
<PB N="xi" REF="10">
loading the Reader and &s;wel|ling
the Book; and this, as it is a
Limitation, he calls a <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Several Subjects nece&s;&s;ary to be
treated of, in the narrow Compa&s;s &s;o
limitted; none of which could be
more fully handled without thru&s;ting
others out.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The Nature of in&s;tructing Children
is peculiar to it&s;elf, and forbids pro|lix
Di&s;cour&s;es; We are not upon a
critical Di&s;&s;ertation, but a plain,
open, and conci&s;e Rea&s;oning; &s;uited
to the Reading of Children, and
&s;uited to the Que&s;tions which are
&s;uppo&s;ed the Children were capable of
propounding.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Hence the plaine&s;t Things are propo&s;ed,
and the plaine&s;t An&s;wers are given, with|out
<PB N="xii" REF="11">
entring into a tedious Search into. An|tiquity,
and without drawing up the
Champions and Arguments on either
Side, like Armies in <HI>Battalia.</HI></P>
<P>Capital Truths are &s;upported by the
fewe&s;t Credentials; 'tis enough to bring
good Authority for the Fundamentals or
Principles, and then &s;tand by tho&s;e
Principles as e&s;tabli&s;hed. Thus the Fa|ther
fir&s;t confirms the Divine Authority of
the Scripture, and then brings the Scrip|ture
as an undoubted Authority for what
it &s;upports.</P>
<P>As to Popery, 'tis treated, indeed, with
Ridicule and Je&s;t; but then it is not in
a Way of Buffoon and Raillery, but the
Ridicule is form'd upon its own Ab&s;urdities,
as well in Doctrine as Practice; and tho&s;e
Practices reduced into Evidence: So that
no Inju&s;tice is willingly done the Papi&s;ts,
<PB N="xiii" REF="12">
either as to their Per&s;ons or their Prin|ciples.</P>
<P>If they have expo&s;ed them&s;elves by of|fering
&s;uch gro&s;s things to the World, as
to make the very Children laugh at them;
if their Practice is loaded with innume|rable
Fripperies; if a ridiculous Pagean|try
glares in our Faces in their mo&s;t &s;o|lemn
Things; they mu&s;t bear with the
World for mobbing them off the Stage;
and if they are hi&s;s'd at, they mu&s;t be con|tent,
while they do Things that cannot he
otherwi&s;e treated.</P>
<P>There is, however, an Account given
in the Work it&s;elf, why the Father cho&s;e to
talk of Popery in &s;uch a Way; being what
&s;uited be&s;t the Method which his Apo&s;tatiz'd
Son took with his Si&s;ters, and be&s;t fur|ni&s;hed
the Children to an&s;wer him in his
own Way; yet, even the merrie&s;t Tale of
<PB N="xiv" REF="13">
them all, is vouched by ju&s;tifiable Authori|ties,
and &s;upported by authentick Hi&s;tory;
&s;o the Authors quoted are an&s;werable for
it, that 'tis no Slander.</P>
<P>The la&s;t and mo&s;t important Branch of
the Parents In&s;truction, may, perhaps, be
mo&s;t cavill'd at, as it is, indeed, a Subject,
which at pre&s;ent, is, di&s;puted in the World,
chiefly by the Help of Cavil and Cri|tici&s;m:
I &s;hall &s;ay no more than this for it;
Tho' all may not be &s;aid, that the Cau&s;e
would admit, yet nothing is &s;aid but what
is, I believe, well &s;upported by the Au|thority
of Scripture, and that Scripture
Authority made &s;o plain too, that even
the Children could not only receive it,
but receive Satisfaction by it.</P>
<P>The Arguments upon the weighty Sub|ject
of the Divinity of our Saviour, have
been &s;o long, and &s;o learnedly controverted
<PB N="xv" REF="14">
in the World, that &s;ome are apt to &s;ay,
there remains nothing to be &s;aid upon that
Point that has not been &s;aid before; but
I mu&s;t take upon me to an&s;wer in the Ne|gative,
and refer to the Work within;
where, I believe, &s;ome Arguments are
brought for the Affirmative, which how|ever
old the Di&s;pute is, and howsoever
learned the Di&s;putants, yet have never
been handled before, at lea&s;t among us.
The Author &s;ays, tho&s;e Arguments have
been convincing, nay, confirming to him|&s;elf,
and, he hopes, they may be &s;o to
others; at lea&s;t, he has done his Endea|vour,
with Diligence and Sincerity, and
hopes he may, with a compo&s;ed Mind,
expect a Ble&s;&s;ing. A MEN.</P>

<HEAD>A NEW

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<P>_A FORMER Work, which bore this
Title, has gone very &s;ucce&s;sfully thro'
tho&s;e Branches of In&s;truction, which
more e&s;pecially concern'd the fir&s;t and
younge&s;t Stages of Life, and for in|&s;tilling
the mo&s;t early Notions, of God and Religion,
into the Minds of Children not grown up.</P>
<P>But, Religious In&s;truction is never at End, till
our Children cea&s;e to be Children; nor even then,
while there is a Di&s;po&s;ition in them to be farther in|form'd:
Ma&s;ters of Families can never be too care|ful
to fortify the Minds of their Po&s;terity with good
Principles; and prepare them to encounter tho&s;e Ene|mies
of all &s;erious Religion, which they &s;hall be &s;ure
to meet with, as they grow up, in an Age &s;o bold in
Error as this is.</P>
<P>For the&s;e Rea&s;ons, I have made it my Study
for &s;everal Years, to find out &s;ome Family, if it
was po&s;&s;ible, who&s;e Example might be Hi&s;torically
recommended to the World, and where other
Parents, and other Children might have a Pattern
laid before them, a Rule to walk and act by; and
<PB N="2" REF="16">
from whom, I might take a Light to guide my &s;elf,
in the great Work of in&s;tructing Families, and that
Children might have a Standard for their Conduct
in Ages to come.</P>
<P>The Family, who I have thus made the Point in
Per&s;pective, and &s;et before you for Imitation in this
Work, are not nam'd: Decency forbids it; we &s;hould
no more publi&s;h our Prai&s;es by Name, than Re|proaches.
'Tis enough that &s;uch Families have been,
and, we may be encourag'd to believe, &s;uch may be
again; that Fathers, alike diligent in the in&s;tructing
their Children, &s;hall have the like Succe&s;s; for Chil|dren
&s;o in&s;tructed, generally make good In&s;tructors in
their Turn, and Religion is propagated in Families by
the Examples of the Teachers that went before them.</P>
<P>There dwelt in the City of <HI>London,</HI> a Per&s;on of a
middling Size, as to Figure and E&s;tate, being what we
call a Sab&s;tantial Trade&s;man, or Shopkeeper; one that
had been many Years in Bu&s;ine&s;s; and had by In|du&s;try,
and an hone&s;t Application in his way of
Trade, obtained &s;ome tolerable Share of Wealth; in
a Word, one who pa&s;s'd for a Rich Man, in propor|tion
to his Trade, which was that of an Apothecary,
and he liv'd not far from <HI>Leadenball-Street.</HI></P>
<P>He had &s;everal Children, who he had Educated
very carefully, as well with re&s;pect to their Manners
and Morals, as their Principles and Religion: And it
appear'd in their Behaviour, as Family Government
generally does: Education is an Ornament, that
&s;hines in the Children who are In&s;tructed, and
reflects back a Lu&s;tre on the Parent In&s;tructing;
and &s;o it was here, for the Parent and the Children
were Ornaments to one another; their Neighbours
valued them; the Father was re&s;pected by every
Body, as the mo&s;t known and eminent Example, for
the well Ordering, and good Government of his
Family; and the Children were ob&s;erv'd, for having
an Original Beauty upon their Appearance, a Mode&s;ty,
<PB N="3" REF="17">
Decency, and Sober Behaviour, peculiar, as it were,
to them&s;elves; which &s;hew'd they had been well
Taught, and that they had been obedient Ob&s;ervers
of their Father's good In&s;trucions.</P>
<P>This, as it gave their Father a general Character,
as I have &s;aid, &s;o it recommended the Children; the
&s;ober Families in the Neighbourhood, placed them
as Patterns for the Conduct of their own Children,
recommending the&s;e for Companions to them, and for
Examples; being always mighty well &s;atisfied, when
they &s;aw any of their own Children keep Company
with Mr.&mdash;the Apothecary's; for then they were
&s;ure to hear nothing ami&s;s; So that, in a Word, The
Children of this hone&s;t Man, had the Character of
&s;ober, well-bred, religious Youths, above all the re&s;t
of the Neighbourhood, and were beloved and
e&s;teem'd by every body on that Account.</P>
<P>Nor was this all, but his own Example &s;pread it&s;elf
among other Families; it encouraged other Ma&s;ters
of Families in the &s;ame Street, and in neighbouring
Places to do the &s;ame; and &s;everal of them &s;et about
the great and nece&s;&s;ary Work of Family In&s;truction,
by his Example.</P>
<P>The Apothecary was a Man well Educated him|&s;elf,
and particularly he had had a Religious Father;
and tho' he had not, what we call a Liberal Education,
that is, had not been bred at the Univer&s;ity; yet he had
&s;ome Learning; as, indeed, his Calling of an Apothe|cary,
in &s;ome mea&s;ure, requir'd; and this qualify'd him
&s;till the more, for the great Work of in&s;tructing his Chil|dren,
as it gave him the Knowledge, not of Religion only,
in the common and ordinary practical Parts of it: But
al&s;o, had made him Ca&s;ui&s;t enough, and able to inform
his Children, in the mo&s;t difficult and di&s;puted Arti|cles
of Religion; e&s;pecially tho&s;e Points chiefly de|bated
between the Popi&s;h, and the Reformed
Churches. And as he lived in a Time when tho&s;e
Points came more than ordinarily to be di&s;puted;
<PB N="4" REF="18">
namely, From the Time of the Re&s;toration of King
<HI>Charles</HI> II. when Popery began to be more than,
u&s;ually encourag'd, and to encroach upon this Nation;
and to the Time of King <HI>James</HI> II. when it made a
bold Pu&s;h at a Re-e&s;tabli&s;hment; So he had a more
than ordinary Occa&s;ion, to make u&s;e of his Know|ledge
and Experience in tho&s;e Controver&s;ies; to con|firm
his Children in the be&s;t Principles, and to qua|lify
them to encounter with Error, and with all the
Auxiliar Powers of Idolatry, &s;uch as Super&s;tition
Blind Zeal, Ignorance, and Ignorant Devotion; all
which were exceedingly growing, and getting Ground
upon this Nation, during that whole Interval, how|ever
long, from 1661, to 1688; that is to &s;ay&punc;
when it received that fatal Blow by the Revolution&punc;
in which the Religion, as well as Liberties of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI>
were effectually Settled and E&s;tabli&s;h'd, a$
they continue to this Day: 'Tis true, Popery begin
now, indeed, to &s;truggle again, and to gain Ground
too among us; an eminent Sign of the Decay of
Chri&s;tian Knowledge, and of reviving the loo&s;e Prin|ciples
of Ignorance and Super&s;tition among us; al$
which concurs to make the pre&s;ent Undertaking the
more u&s;eful, and even ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary among us.
But to return to my Subject;</P>
<P>The Apothecary's Cu&s;tom in his Family, and
which is very u&s;eful to de&s;cribe for the Imitation, of
others, was as follows.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. When his Children were Young, he con&s;tantly
every Day read to them Two Chapters of the
Bible in the Morning, and Two in the
Afternoon.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Which I &s;hould have mentioned fir&s;t, but that
his Reading was always fir&s;t; He con&s;tantly
call'd them all together, with his whole Hou&s;e,
Servants as well as Children, to his Family
Wor&s;hip.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="5" REF="19">
3. Every Day, for about an Hour, which was
generally after Dinner, he took Occa&s;ion to
talk familiarly to his Children upon any u&s;eful
Subject, as Things proper for Conver&s;ation pre|&s;ented;
e&s;pecially, making his Di&s;cour&s;e, at
tho&s;e Times, agreeable, plea&s;ant to his Chil|dren,
and &s;uitable to' their Under&s;tanding.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>As his Children grew up, he chang'd his Reading
the Scripture, before his Morning and Evening
Prayer, to his cau&s;ing his Children to read it them|&s;elves,
and to read &s;o in their Turns, as to be &s;ure
to have them all read alike.</P>
<P>And then, in&s;tead of his daily Di&s;cour&s;es, after
Dinner, he employ'd the Hour, for two Days only
in a Week, in Catechi&s;ing his Children, and his Ser|vants
al&s;o, that is to &s;ay, his Apprentices, and &s;uch
other as would &s;ubmit to it; tho' Servants began
even then, to be a little above &s;ubmitting to be cate|chi&s;ed,
as mo&s;t of them are &s;ince.</P>
<P>After &s;ome Years more, the Children grew too big
for the Catechi&s;e too, and being al&s;o perfect in all
the An&s;wers, not only of the particular Cate|chi&s;m,
but of all &s;uch Que&s;tions as related to the
grounding them in the Principles of Chri&s;tian Know|ledge,
then he re&s;um'd tho&s;e two Hours, or the
dining Hours of tho&s;e two Days, for his former Kind
of Di&s;cour&s;es.</P>
<P>Only 1. As they encrea&s;ed in Knowledge and
Years, &s;o he &s;uited his Lectures, or <HI>Table-Talk</HI> (as
it might be called) to their Years, carrying them on
from one Thing to another, till, in a Word, he
made them Ma&s;ters of almo&s;t all &s;orts of u&s;eful
Knowledge, and of all the needful Points of Reli|gion;
I mean, the di&s;puted Points, e&s;pecially &s;uch
as related to Idolatry, to <HI>Socinian</HI> Errors, and to all
the Modern Here&s;ies of the Times; &s;uch as to
Dei&s;m, Sceptici&s;m, and Athei&s;m, with all our
<PB N="6" REF="20">
Free-thinking Errors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Things which were but
newly &s;tarted up in the World, in his Time,
and were not grown to the flagrant Height as
we have &s;ince &s;een them come to; and which his
Succe&s;&s;ors in this happy Practice, found it much
more difficult to &s;truggle with. By this daily
Practice, con&s;cientiou&s;ly and diligently continued
his Children grew up to &s;uch a Degree of Know|ledge,
and to &s;uch a &s;olid Judgment, in all needful
Points, that they were not to be equall'd as a Fa|mily,
and were the Admiration of all that knew
them; e&s;pecially as this Degree of their Under&s;tand|ing
in the be&s;t Things, was join'd with a Degree o$
Mode&s;ty and Humility in their Behaviour, according
to the Pattern of their worthy Father, which was
admired by all People, and imitable but by very few.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Things going on with them till they came
to riper Years, they became a very happy Family&punc;
and being ble&s;s'd, and &s;ucce&s;sful too in the World&punc;
the ancient Father, grown &s;o by living near Eighty
Years of Age, died in Peace; having liv'd to &s;e$
mo&s;t of his Children well and comfortably &s;ettle$
in the World, treading happily in his own Steps&punc;
as well of Religion as Sobriety, and governing their
own Families in the &s;ame excellent Order, after hi$
Example.</P>
<P>While the pious Father was alive, it was ob&s;erv'd&punc;
that the good Order and Government of his Family
was &s;uch, that, as I have &s;aid, &s;everal other Ma&s;ter
of Families, in the Neighbourhood, &s;et up the
&s;ame, or like Family Orders, in their Hou&s;es by
his Example, and &s;ome of them would u&s;e &s;o much
Freedom with him, as to come and di&s;cour&s;e with
him, as they found Occa&s;ion, in order to have his Ad|vice
and Direction, in Ca&s;es wherein they met with
Difficulty and Ob&s;truction in the Way of their per|forming
it; &s;ome from refractory Children, &s;ome
from di&s;orderly Servants, and &s;ome from the Hin|drance
<PB N="7" REF="21">
of other Relations; &s;ome of one Kind, &s;ome
of another.</P>
<P>This good Man was always their Oracle, in tho&s;e
Difficulties, and he gave his Advice with &s;uch Ten|derne&s;s
and Concern for the Per&s;ons occa&s;ioning
tho&s;e Ob&s;tructions, he being a Man of a large
Heart, an exten&s;ive Charity, and abounding with a
Sweetne&s;s of Temper, that he never got the Ill-will
of any Body, tho' he found him&s;elf oblig'd to be,
as it were, a Coun&s;ellor again&s;t them.</P>
<P>He had put his elde&s;t Son out Apprentice to an
<HI>Italian</HI> Merchant, in the &s;ame Street, who was a
very &s;ober good Man, and had a &s;ober Family, tho'
not quite &s;o religious a Family as the Apothecary but
who, being acquainted with the Apothecary and his
Family, &s;oon follow'd the Example, at lea&s;t in &s;ome
Part of it; particularly, the Merchant kept extraordi|nary
Family-Orders, and a con&s;tant Family-Wor&s;hip,
and, which was very remarkable in a Gentleman bred
abroad, that is to &s;ay, in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> he was
a very &s;trict Ob&s;erver of the Lord's Day.</P>
<P>Nor did he &s;anctify the Day, according to our
modern Practice of keeping the Sabbath in Time of
<HI>Divine Service</HI> only, as if the Command had been
under their Correction, or that it had been worded
thus: <HI>Remember,</HI> all the Time of Divine Service, on
<HI>the Sabbath Day to keep it holy;</HI> but from the Evening
of the Sabbath there were, in his Family, vi&s;ible
Tokens of its Approach by a Kind of gradual Pre|paration.</P>
<P>It was with him as it is in the Cour&s;e of Na|ture
on the Break of Day, that as there is a
Twilight in the Morning before the Sun ri&s;es,
intimating that the Day is approaching, that the
Shades of the Night are &s;cattering; that the Peo|ple,
if they are awake, may think of getting up,
and going about their proper Calling; So on the
<HI>Saturday</HI> Evening there was an <HI>Apparatus</HI> for the
<PB N="8" REF="22">
approaching Day, a gradual cea&s;ing from Bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
laying down the daily Labour &s;ooner than
at other Times; going to Bed &s;ooner that they
might not be oblig'd to lie a Bed in the Morning
longer than u&s;ual; retiring in the Evening for &s;uita|ble
Meditations, preparatory for the Sabbath, and,
as the good Merchant him&s;elf u&s;ed to call it, getting
his Sabbath-Day Thoughts about him; and in this
Particular, the Merchant even out-did the Apothe|cary:
There were, indeed, two Things, which were
accidental to their re&s;pective Callings, which made a
Difference in the Manner of their Family-Govern|ment,
as it related to the Particular above, and yet
they were both &s;trict and religious Ob&s;ervers of
all &s;uch Duties as Con&s;cience and good Principles
requir'd.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Merchant, by the Cour&s;e of his Bu&s;ine&s;s,
being call'd out to the Exchange (for the Ex|change-Time
was then u&s;ually about One
o'Clock) could not &s;pare the Time, from the
clo&s;e of his Dinner, to &s;it, and talk, and con|ver&s;e
familiarly, with his Children, as the
other did; his Bu&s;ine&s;s nece&s;&s;arily called him
away, and he was oblig'd to attend the Call.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Apothecary, by the Cour&s;e of his Bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
being call'd, on many Occa&s;ions, to vi&s;it
his Patients, make up Medicines, and give At|tendance
on Phy&s;icians on the Sabbath Day,
all which were Works of Chri&s;tianity, and with|in
the very expre&s;s Letter of Chri&s;t's Com|mand,
who was Lord of the Sabbath; could
not be &s;o exactly and literally &s;trict in the Ob|&s;ervance
of the Day, as to &s;etting it apart for
religious Wor&s;hip, as the Merchant might be.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Now, as, I &s;ay both the&s;e were accidental to their
Bu&s;ine&s;s, and vi&s;ible Callings, &s;o they might, as
<PB N="9" REF="23">
above, cau&s;e &s;ome Difference in the Manner of
their Family Order; but they neither of them hin|dred,
but that a &s;trict Ob&s;ervance of religious Duties
was the general De&s;ign of both the Families, and of
the whole Tenour of their Practice.</P>
<P>The Apothecary's elde&s;t Son, being put an Ap|prentice
to this religious <HI>Italian</HI> Merchant, it was
little more than removing him out of one religious
Academy to another; for excepting the Difference
of the Bu&s;ine&s;s, he was &s;till under the &s;ame religious
Government, had a Ma&s;ter who carried him on to|wards
Heaven, in the &s;ame Way or Road, (as it
might be &s;aid) which he went in before; and as he
was, from his Childhood, &s;oberly and religiou&s;ly in|clin'd,
he had all po&s;&s;ible Encouragement and A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
to be &s;o &s;till.</P>
<P>In the Cour&s;e of Bu&s;ine&s;s, the Merchant &s;ent him
over into <HI>Languedoc,</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> where he had, for a
while, the Advantage of the Prote&s;tant Wor&s;hip,
the Prote&s;tant Religion having not been then for|bidden
in <HI>France;</HI> but it was &s;oon after; and there he
had the mi&s;erable Occa&s;ion of &s;eeing the Ruin and
De&s;truction of the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t in <HI>France,</HI> their
King (<HI>Lewis</HI> XIV.) having at once revoked the fa|mous
Edict of <HI>Nantes.</HI></P>
<P>On this &s;ad Occa&s;ion, he received &s;uitable Ideas
of Popi&s;h Cruelty, as by the &s;ame Means he did of
Popi&s;h Idolatry, of both which he entertain'd a ju&s;t
Abhorrence in his Mind; and from thence, though
much Art was u&s;ed with him by the Prie&s;ts at <HI>Mar|&s;eilles,</HI>
to pervert him and draw him over from the
Prote&s;tant Faith, it was all in vain; their Cruelty
had given him &s;uch an Idea of their Religion, that
he could never be prevail'd with, by their Subtilties
and fair Means; But withal, It made him &s;o unea&s;y
in his Bu&s;ine&s;s, which was then at <HI>Mar&s;illes,</HI> that
he re&s;olv'd to quit <HI>France,</HI> and accordingly he went
to <HI>Leghorn,</HI> where he lived &s;everal Years, and
<PB N="10" REF="24">
traded with good Succe&s;s, whence he afterwards re|turn'd
to <HI>England,</HI> and &s;ettled him&s;elf in <HI>London</HI>
marry'd, had no le&s;s than Seven Children, and bein$
in very good Circum&s;tances, as to E&s;tate, he left o$
Bu&s;ine&s;s, or, at lea&s;t, the greate&s;t Part of it, an$
lived private, but in very good Figure and Fa&s;h$
on, in and near the City, till he was very old.</P>
<P>This being the General Hi&s;tory of his Life, $word$
remains only to add, that after the Example of h$$
Father, and of his Ma&s;ter, he was a mo&s;t pious an$
&s;eriou&s;ly religious Per&s;on; and &s;hew'd it nor only b$
a Per&s;onal Behaviour, through the whole Series o$
a long Life, as is &s;aid above; but, particularly, i$
the well ordering, and good Government of his Fa|mily;
in&s;tructing, teaching, and educating his Chil|dren
in the Paths of Virtue and Religion; in whic$
his own Example went a great way, and kept a$
equal pace with his Influence. But in particular h$
took up the very &s;ame Method of Family Order a$
his religious Father had done before him, (<HI>viz.</HI>) t$
make him&s;elf u&s;eful and agreeable to his Children
and to bring them, by the happy Plea&s;antne&s;s of hi$
Temper, to delight in his In&s;tructions, as well as to
be better'd by them; &s;o that he made his Dictates be
as plea&s;ant as profitable, and his Children took a$
much Delight to hear him di&s;cour&s;e to them o$
&s;olid, &s;erious, and profitable Things, as others would
do in hearing a plea&s;ant Tune, &s;ung by a fine charm|ing
Voice, or a good mu&s;ical In&s;trument, touch'd
by a skilful Hand.</P>
<P>So exqui&s;ite was his Art in thus in&s;inuating him|&s;elf
into the Affections of his Children, that they de|lighted
in him, and it added to their Ta&s;te of the
good Things he di&s;cour&s;ed to them of; nor did his
Years le&s;&s;en the Affection, or render his Society le&s;s
delightful to them, for he retain'd the Youth of
his Temper, even to the la&s;t, as he did the Strength
of his Memory.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="25">
His Skill, in the Choice of a Subject, which he
di&s;cour&s;ed to them of, was no le&s;s delicate than the
exqui&s;ite Manner of his di&s;cour&s;ing; he made every|thing
plea&s;ant and agreeable, by the extraordinary
Method he took to di&s;cour&s;e of it; even the grave&s;t
and mo&s;t &s;olemn Subjects were, by his artful Man|ner,
made delightful to them to receive; and yet, at
the &s;ame Time, retained the Gravity and Solemnity
of their Nature; nor did his di&s;cour&s;ing of them
lo&s;e or le&s;&s;en the awful Reverence due to the mo&s;t
&s;acred and maje&s;tick Things; for he was far from,
treating grave and &s;erious Subjects with Levity, or
in a manner that would le&s;&s;en the Dignity and Au|thority
of Truth; but, on the other Hand, he did
not load the Subject with a heavy and trouble&s;ome
Ceremony, with dark and doubtful Expre&s;&s;ions,
like the Heathen Rites, that were made My&s;tick,
loaded with Barbari&s;ms, and uncouth horrid Ge&s;tures,
to fill the Mind with Horror, and &s;o build a Reve|rence
upon the meer Foundation of their being un|intelligible.</P>
<P>On the contrary, while he gave &s;acred Things
their ju&s;t Regard, and placed them at a due Di&s;tance
from Things ludicrous, or Things le&s;s &s;erious, he
yet endeavour'd to place them in a true Per&s;pective,
and in a Level with the Under&s;tanding; that his
Children might receive ju&s;t Ideas of them, might
compleatly under&s;tand them, and might conceive of
them as they ought to be conceived of.</P>
<P>In this Manner he went on educating and breeding,
or bringing up, his Children in the Fear and Know|ledge
of God, in the Love of Religion, and Divine
Truth, and in all the be&s;t and mo&s;t improving Parts
of Human Knowledge, that he thought &s;uitable to
make them wi&s;e and religious both together; accord|ing
to the ju&s;t Notions, and excellent Example of
his Father, and his Ma&s;ter, of which I have &s;poken
already.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="26">
Nor was his Succe&s;s le&s;s encouraging, or the
Ble&s;&s;ing of it le&s;s vi&s;ible, than that of his Father; for
his Family was a little College, where the Youth
were happily introduced, and his daily Di&s;cour&s;es to
them were like the publick Lectures in an Univer&s;ity;
&s;ometimes upon one Subject, &s;ometimes upon ano|ther;
&s;ometimes upon religious Points; and of the&s;e,
&s;ometimes the more Practical and Doctrinal Points,
at other Times Points in Controver&s;y; in all which,
he &s;tudied to make his Di&s;cour&s;es &s;hort, to bring
every Que&s;tion into a narrow Compa&s;s, and to ex|pre&s;s
every Thing in few Words, plain and intelli|gible,
&s;uited to the Capacity and Under&s;tanding of
his Children; and to increa&s;e and widen tho&s;e Ca|pacities
too, that by under&s;tanding, they made them|&s;elves
more and more capable to under&s;tand.</P>
<P>Accordingly, when he undertook that Part with
his Children, as he was forced to do, on Account of
his elde&s;t Son's being unhappily &s;educ'd; he took this
Way: He told his Children &s;o many Stories of Po|pery,
all of them true, vouched from the Papi&s;ts own
Mouths, and the Practice of their own Champions,
that they laugh'd Popery, and their Popi&s;h Bro|ther
too (who thought to convert them all) quite out
of the Family.</P>
<P>He took the &s;ame Cour&s;e with Sociniani&s;m and
other Errors, and with the like Succe&s;s: So that, in
a Word, mingling thus the &s;erious and the comick,
he &s;tript tho&s;e Errors &s;tark naked; brought his Chil|dren
to entertain &s;olid Truth, with a &s;erious and &s;o|lemn
Steadine&s;s of Re&s;olution, and hi&s;s'd their Oppo|&s;itcs
off the Stage, pelting them with their own Dirt,
&s;ti&s;ling them with their own Rubbi&s;h; till, in
&s;hort, in&s;tead of being perverted by their Brother,
they were made the happy In&s;trument of bringing him
back, to his Sen&s;es, and to receive and embrace again
the Truths, which he had &s;o unhappily for&s;aken.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="27">
But he did not confine his In&s;tructions to the&s;e
Controver&s;ies; the young Heads, who were under
his Care, required other Work al&s;o; they were to be
made wi&s;e as well as religious, and knowing of their
Way through the World, as well as the Way out of it:
'Tis true, he made Religion his fir&s;t Work, and his
chief Care, as he knew it to be their chief Concern;
but he knew a u&s;eful Variety al&s;o would make all the
re&s;t the more Entertaining; and therefore he wi&s;ely
mixt the plea&s;ant with the profitable, and not dwelling
too much upon the grave and the &s;olemn, he inter|lac'd
it with other Things (in their Kind) al&s;o nece&s;|&s;ary;
So he would talk one Day of Religion and the
Scripture, another Day of the World, and its De|&s;cription
by the Maps and Globes; one Day of Mo|ral
Subjects, another of Things Philo&s;ophical; giv|ing
them a View of natural Experiments, Di&s;co|veries,
and the like; &s;ometimes of one Thing, &s;ome|times
of another, but in all making Things ea&s;y
and natural to them, &s;o that they always under&s;tood
what he &s;aid to them, and what he talk'd of, before
he left them, whatever they did before.</P>
<P>When he di&s;cour&s;ed upon Moral Subjects, he di|ge&s;ted
all into an ea&s;y and familiar Stile, general|ly
&s;upporting his Di&s;cour&s;es with &s;ome Examples,
either within their own Knowledge, as to Per&s;ons and
Things pre&s;ent and about them, or from Books.</P>
<P>He taught them Hi&s;tory, e&s;pecially Modern Hi|&s;tory
and Geography; &s;o that when any of the great
Affairs of the World abroad came before them, he
brought the Maps of tho&s;e Parts of the World to
them, and &s;hewed them where every Thing was done;
&s;o that afterwards, if his Children, nay, his Daugh|ters
as well as Sons, read any Hi&s;tory, they would
keep the Maps and Globes before them, to ob&s;erve
which Way the &s;everal Armies march'd, where the
Towns and Cities &s;tood which were be&s;ieg'd, and how
reliev'd either by Land or Sea.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="28">
Thus he fill'd their Heads with Knowledge, &s;tor'd
their Minds with Under&s;tanding and judgment; and,
above all, fortified them in good Principles, and good
Morals, introducing them to the World with infinite
Advantage to them&s;elves; and made them &s;uperior
to all the Children of their Years that were any
where to be found.</P>
<P>When he entred upon Controver&s;ies of any Kind,
and e&s;pecially in religious Things, where the Prin|ciples
he oppos'd were erroneous and heretical; he
&s;tudied to expo&s;e tho&s;e Errors to the Under&s;tanding of
his Children, by bringing them into Story, repre|&s;enting
the Ab&s;urdity, and mo&s;t &s;candalous Parts of
them, as in Picture and Per&s;pective, Piece by Piece;
but always doing it faithfully, &s;hewing the Doctrines
and Principles ju&s;t as they were owned and practi&s;ed
by tho&s;e that profe&s;&s;ed them, and no otherwi&s;e; not
&s;hewing them by any fal&s;e Light, or cloathing them
with, any fal&s;e Glo&s;&s;es of his own.</P>
<P>Plainne&s;s was, in his Opinion, the faire&s;t Way to
deal with <HI>Errors in Religion,</HI> and the ea&s;ie&s;t Way al|&s;o
to convince any one's Judgment, that tho&s;e
Things were really Errors: And &s;o in particular,
he u&s;ed to &s;peak of the Errors of Popery, which he,
having lived Abroad and &s;een &s;o much of, was a
very good Judge of.</P>
<P>He always &s;aid, there needed no other Art to ex|po&s;e
the Errors of Popery, than to dre&s;s them up in
their own Cloaths, paint them in their own Colours,
and expre&s;s them in their own Words; then &s;etting them
before the Eyes of the weake&s;t Under&s;tanding, in the
open Day, and letting them but judge for them&s;elves:
He u&s;ed to &s;ay, that no Body would fall in Love
with the Whore of <HI>Babylon,</HI> if they were to &s;ee
her naked, wa&s;h the Paint off from her Face, and
pull the Feathers out of her Cap; that no Body
would be &s;educed with Popery, if they were to &s;ee
it &s;tript of its fal&s;e Robes, and &s;hewn by Day-light.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="29">
That the be&s;t Way, therefore, to fight the Papi&s;ts,
was to laugh at them, to expo&s;e them to the Ridicule
of the World, bring all their Trinkets and Trumpery
upon the Stage, and let the People &s;ee them.</P>
<P>Add to all that has been &s;aid, that he was a mo&s;t
kind, tender, and affectionate Father to all his Chil|dren;
&s;incerely aimed at, and faithfully pur&s;ued their
Good, both Soul and Body; and made it his whole
Study to oblige them, &s;o far as they were to be
Oblig'd by Rea&s;on and good U&s;age; But &s;till he kept
clo&s;e to the main Point, namely, that it was for their
Good, and con&s;i&s;tent with his Affection, that where
their De&s;ires might, <HI>through their Mi&s;take,</HI> tend to
their own Prejudice; there, <HI>and there only,</HI> his Duty,
even to them&s;elves, demanded, that he &s;hould re|&s;train
them; and yet, even this, he &s;hewed evidently,
he did not do without Reluctance and Unwillingne&s;s,
and where Con&s;cience, and a Sen&s;e of their Benefit
oblig'd him to do it.</P>
<P>His elde&s;t Son, bred up with all the&s;e Advan|tages,
was a very agreeable and promising Gentle|man:
He had been introduc'd into the World in
very happy and ea&s;y Circum&s;tances, and &s;o as that,
having no Occa&s;ion, as he had no Inclination, to in|gage
him&s;elf in the Hurries of Bu&s;ine&s;s, he had no|thing
before him, but to live in the Fullne&s;s of com|mon
Enjoyments, be ea&s;y, and improve both the
World and him&s;elf.</P>
<P>His Father had the Satisfaction of &s;eeing, &s;ome
Years before his Son came to a full-grown Age, or,
<HI>as we call it,</HI> to Man's E&s;tate, that his Inclinations
were &s;ober; for that Part, if well inquired into,
may generally be di&s;cover'd early, and in the fir&s;t
Steps which Youth ordinarily take after they have a
little of the Reins in their own Hands.</P>
<P>He found him inclined to Books, and applying
him&s;elf to manly, and ma&s;terly Studies, &s;uch as Hi|&s;tory,
A&s;tronomy, and &s;everal of the mo&s;t u&s;eful
<PB N="16" REF="30">
Parts of the Mathematicks; and having gone through
a Cour&s;e of Philo&s;ophy at the Univer&s;ity, he (th$
Father) found at his Return, that his Son brought
the Love of Learning with him, from, the Nur&s;er$
of it; that he gave him&s;elf very much up to the
Pur&s;uit of Knowledge, and that not &s;uperficial an$
fa&s;hionable Knowledge, but to the Study of the be
and mo&s;t valuable Things.</P>
<P>After he was a&s;&s;ured of the Solidity of his Son
Temper, his Genius for Improvement, and h$
warm. Application to the be&s;t Studies, and particu|larly
of his Virtue and Morals, he con&s;ented, the
not without great Importunity, to give him Leav$
to travel, and, as it is commonly called, to &s;ee th$
World.</P>
<P>Before he went Abroad the old Gentleman, h$
Father, endeavoured to prepare his Mind for all the
ordinary Incidents of &s;uch an Undertaking, by &s;ea|&s;onably
warning him again&s;t the &s;everal Surprize
he might be in Danger of, and the Snares of Life
as well religious as others, which u&s;ually attende$
young Gentlemen in their travelling through the
&s;everal Countries he was to go through. His Father
was no Stranger to the World, having been bre$
Abroad, as I have &s;aid, lived &s;ome Years in <HI>Langue$
dock,</HI> and at <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> and <HI>Leghoril;</HI> knowing th$
Mi&s;chiefs therefore which attended his Son, he took
the more Liberty to di&s;cour&s;e very freely with hi$
upon the Subject of Travelling, and very often too$
the nearer his Time of going away came on.</P>
<P>He told him, That he was not &s;o aver&s;e to he
Travelling, merely from his Fondne&s;s of his Compa|ny;
tho' being the elde&s;t Son he had, It was not th$
ea&s;ie&s;t Thing in the World to him to &s;end him away
nor for the Hazards of the Journey, &s;eeing the Pro|tection
of Heaven, which he hop'd would be over
him, was equally his Safeguard in all Climates and
Countries; much le&s;s was it for the Expence, being
<PB N="17" REF="31">
&s;atisfy'd that his Prudence would keep him within
the Bounds which he &s;hould con&s;ent to be pre&s;crib'd
to; but that as he had liv'd abroad him&s;elf, and had
&s;een the ruinous Con&s;equence of tho&s;e Liberties, which
our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Youth (e&s;pecially) give themselves Leave
to take, and withal the bad Principles which he
would continually conver&s;e among, he was greatly
anxious for both his Morals and his Religion.</P>
<P>He hinted to him, tho' very gently, that he had,
indeed, ob&s;erv'd with Plea&s;ure his Inclination &s;eem'd
to lead him to a Life of Virtue; but that it was not
a little Abatement of his Satisfaction, that he &s;eem'd
rather moral and &s;ober, than religious; and added,
that really it was the mo&s;t dangerous Thing in the
World for a young Gentleman, &s;ober and virtuous,
to venture into <HI>Italy,</HI> till he was thoroughly ground|ed
in Principle, and had fixt his Mind immoveably
in Matters of Religion; for that nothing was more
ordinary, than for &s;uch, either to be &s;educ'd, by the
Subtlety of the Clergy, to embrace a fal&s;e Religion,
or by the Artifice of a wor&s;e Enemy, to give up all
Religion, and &s;ink into <HI>Sceptici&s;m</HI> and <HI>Dei&s;m,</HI> or,
perhaps, <HI>Athei&s;m.</HI></P>
<P>The young Gentleman li&s;ten'd with Re&s;pect to his
Father's Di&s;crour&s;e, e&s;pecially to the fir&s;t Part; and
gave him many A&s;&s;urances, that he would have all
po&s;&s;ible Regard to his In&s;tructions, would keep with|in
the Limits, as to Expence, which he &s;hould pre|&s;cribe
him; and that he would be always bound by
his Order where-ever he went. As to the la&s;t Part,
relating to Religion, he &s;eem'd to wave it only with a
kind of common Notice, &s;ignifying, that he would
take Care of him&s;elf as much as was po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>This was not the Subject of one or two, but of
many of his Father's Di&s;cour&s;es with him; but as it
would take up too much Room in this &s;mall Tract, to
&s;et down at large all the good In&s;tructions which an
anxious and &s;eriou&s;ly religious Parent gave to a Son
<PB N="18" REF="32">
who he had &s;o much Value for, and in a Ca&s;e &s;o
very important as that of &s;ending him Abroad in the
World, &s;o neither can I wholly omit them: Take,
then, the following, as &s;ome of the mo&s;t earne&s;t,
and, perhaps, the la&s;t of his Di&s;cour&s;es, and which
I &s;et down, as it may be of U&s;e either to Fathers
on a like Occa&s;ion, or to young Gentlemen who go
Abroad and have no Fathers, or none &s;o capable, to
in&s;truct them.</P>
<DIV3 N="1">
<HEAD>DIALOGUE I.</HEAD>
<P>THE Father is to be &s;uppos'd now to be pre|vail'd
with, after many Importunities, and the
Interce&s;&s;ion of Friends, to con&s;ent to part with his
Son, tho' not without &s;ome Conditions and Limita|tions
which he had thought fit to pre&s;cribe to him
for his Conduct abroad: he had, I &s;ay, yielded to
let him travel; but before it went &s;o far as to make
any Preparation for his Journey, much le&s;s appoint|ing
him the Time when he &s;hould &s;et out, he took at
Occa&s;ion one Evening to di&s;cour&s;e with him more
&s;eriou&s;ly, and more at large upon that Subject, that
he had ever done before: The Sub&s;tance of which
Di&s;cour&s;e you may take in the following Dialogue.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Son, I find your Heart is very much
&s;et upon this Ramble; I wi&s;h it may an&s;wer your
End; but I am very full of Thoughts about it
I am not half &s;o ea&s;y in it as you are, or perhaps a
you think I am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am &s;orry to &s;ee you &s;o unea&s;y about it, Sir
I hope you &s;hall have no Cau&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="19" REF="33">
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are more Cau&s;es for a Father's Unea&s;i|ne&s;s
in it, than you perhaps can be &s;en&s;ible of; you
do not &s;ee the Dangers you are running into, it may
be, &s;o well as I do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not &s;ee any Dangers in it at all, the com|mon
Accidents of Life excepted, which we are &s;afe
from no where: You have been abroad, Sir, and
you know the Dangers there, are no more than upon
an ordinary Journey in our own Country, nor hard|ly
&s;o many; I have heard you &s;ay &s;o your&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not know but I may have been a little
too forward in talking &s;o indeed, not thinking of
what now happens to be the Ca&s;e; for I cannot &s;ay
neither, that travelling is &s;o perfectly &s;afe and free,
from Dangers abroad as it may be here: But, how|ever,
tho&s;e are not the Dangers that I am &s;peaking of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you do not mean &s;uch Dangers, Sir, that's
another Ca&s;e; indeed I &s;ee no other Dangers than are
at Home, except the Hazards of the Sea, and &s;ome|times
of Robbers, Banditti, and Highwaymen, who,
I have been told, are not apt to be &s;o generous
abroad as they are here; for &s;ometimes, it &s;eems,
they kill before they rob.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, I neither mean the Dangers of the
Sea, or of Highway Robbers; they do not al|ways
kill before they rob: I was robb'd my&s;elf in
the <HI>Lyons</HI> Coach, which they call there <HI>La Diligence,</HI>
between <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Chalons,</HI> and I receiv'd no other
Injury than the Lo&s;s of my Portmanteau, and about
&s;ixty Pi&s;toles; the Fellows were very civil to us,
give them their due.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are not always &s;o, I doubt; we had a
&s;ad Example of it upon &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentlemen in
<HI>France</HI> la&s;t Year.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true, they are not always &s;o; but it is
then chiefly when the Pa&s;&s;engers have Servants on
Hor&s;eback well arm'd, and have Fire-Arms them|&s;elves;
in which Ca&s;e they begin the Battle before
<PB N="20" REF="34">
the Plunder; or on &s;ome other particular Occa&s;ions;
what the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentlemens Ca&s;e was, I do not re|member,
but that is not the thing, <HI>I tell you,</HI> that I
mean.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then. Sir, can you be &s;o unea&s;y about?
I hope my Conduct has not been &s;uch at Home, a$
to make you fear I will go to ruin my&s;elf Abroad.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot &s;ay, neither, that my Fears are &s;o
much for you on account of your Virtue; there are
but two Things Abroad to attack your Morals, and
they are Wine or Women; the fir&s;t you will &s;ee no
Nations practi&s;e as we do here, and he that will be
&s;ober at Home, &s;eldom turns Drunkard when he
comes Abroad.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope, Sir, you have not &s;een my Inclina|tions
look that way; I mean to either Wine or
Women.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor do my Anxieties point that way neither;
indeed, Son, I am more in Pain for your Religion
than your Morals, and that for many Rea&s;ons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope I &s;hall give you no occa&s;ion, Sir, to
be afraid of me on that account neither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hall be glad to hope &s;o too, but there may
be more Dangers that Way than you are yet aware
of; becau&s;e you will have more Attempts made on
the Cha&s;tity of your Soul, than of your Body.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>What kind of Attempts, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you will &s;ee as &s;oon as you come to any
Place in <HI>Italy,</HI> or in <HI>France,</HI> or in <HI>Spain,</HI> for it is
much the &s;ame, you will there have a Specimen of
their Church Policy: And, fir&s;t, the Prie&s;ts come
immediately about you; they think it meritorious to
make a Pro&s;elyte, and they go about it in the artfulle&s;t
Manner imaginable; 'tis almo&s;t impo&s;ible to &s;u&s;pect
them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Cour&s;es will they take, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, their Art, I &s;ay, is inexpre&s;&s;ible; they
fir&s;t in&s;inuate into your Company, on pretence of
<PB N="21" REF="35">
your being a Stranger, they offer you all imaginable
Civilities, give you the utmo&s;t Re&s;pect, &s;hew you
every thing that is rare and curious, wait upon you
to your Apartments, officiou&s;ly &s;erve you with the
greate&s;t Diligence, and with &s;uch inimitable Courte&s;y,
&s;o faithful, &s;o a&s;&s;iduous, &s;o apparently di&s;intere&s;ted,
'tis impo&s;&s;ible not to be obliged by them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad to hear they will be &s;o helpful, for
as a Stranger, one cannot be unwilling to be obliged,
e&s;pecially &s;ince, Sir, you &s;ay they will do it faithfully,
and di&s;intere&s;tedly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, I &s;ay, apparently it is &s;o; nor do
I &s;ay or &s;ugge&s;t, that they have any real &s;elf-intere&s;ted
View, I mean, for Gain, to make any per&s;onal Ad|vantage
of you, or to get any thing from you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Danger can there be then, Sir, either
of them, or from them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, they will carry it farther, if you offer
them Money, they'll civilly refu&s;e it, or ask you leave
to give it to the Poor before your Face.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are they &s;afe, then, as to Cheating or Frauds?
I thought quite otherwi&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ju&s;t the contrary, and therein lies the Snare,
they will convince you, that they &s;corn to make the
lea&s;t Advantage of you that way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought they had been all Cheats and
Pick-pockets.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing like it, that is to &s;ay, the particular
Sort of them that I &s;peak of; they profe&s;s Poverty,
and a Contempt of Money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>This mu&s;t be a Cheat, that they may at the
&s;ame Time make a Prey of a Stranger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That it is a Cheat, I do not deny, and that
of the wor&s;t Kind; but their De&s;igns are of a higher
Nature than that of Money: Nay, if they find that
you really want Money, they will frequently find
ways to &s;upply you; and though they pretend to have
no Money them&s;elves, they'll bring Gentlemen to
<PB N="22" REF="36">
you that &s;hall generou&s;ly lend you, nay, perhaps, give
you Sums of Money, as it were, in compliment to
your Occa&s;ion; and they'll do it with &s;uch a Pream|ble,
&s;uch a hand&s;ome Introduction, telling you that
they find you are a Gentleman; that, perhaps, you
may be under &s;ome Di&s;appointment; that 'tis not
their Bu&s;ine&s;s to inquire into your Occa&s;ions; but beg
you will be pleas'd to accept &s;uch a Trifle; that they
&s;hould be glad to receive the &s;ame Favour, if they
were Strangers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I have known them on &s;uch
Occa&s;ions, the Prie&s;t having fir&s;t let them into the
Secret of it, put Twenty Pi&s;toles into a Gentleman's
Hand, and tell him, he &s;hould oblige them, if he
Pleas'd to accept it, as a Loan far his pre&s;ent Occa&s;ions,
and that he might return it, if he thought fit, at his
lei&s;ure; or giving his Parole, that he would give
it to the Poor, when he came into Circum&s;tances to
do it, and that he would take it for full Payment,
expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf religiou&s;ly Charitable on that ac|count.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can there be any ill De&s;ign, Sir, in &s;uch
generous Things as the&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, they'll go further, they will ask you,
What Rout you think to take in your Travels? and
whether they may be farther &s;erviceable to you? that,
if you think fit to tru&s;t them with letting them know
&s;o much of your Affairs, (which, however, they do
not de&s;ire, but for your Service) they will give you
Letters to &s;ome of their Friends in this or that
Country (&s;uch as you &s;hall mention) which &s;hall be
no Di&s;&s;ervice to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is, indeed, &s;trangely obliging; can there
be any Deceit in &s;uch Behaviour as this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, all Cheat &s;till, and the mo&s;t dan|gerous
of all Cheats: But I have not done with it,
for they will go farther than all this &s;till.</P>
</SP>
<P>If you accept of the Offer, as, indeed, who can
decline it? and tell them the next City or the next
<PB N="23" REF="37">
Province you are bonnd to; they give you Letters
of Recommendation to &s;uch a Merchant, or, per|haps
to a Per&s;on of Quality, in which they treat
you, as if you were their particular Friend, Intimate,
or even Relation; and that whatever Service they
do you, &s;hall be received as done to them&s;elves;
&s;o that you are &s;ure to be received like a Prince, and
treated with the utmo&s;t Di&s;tinction and Re&s;pect.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>What harm, is it po&s;&s;ible, there, can be in all
this, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, in the fir&s;t Place, the Prie&s;ts View is to
convince you of their Piety, Sincerity, impartial
Beneficence, general Courte&s;y, di&s;intere&s;ted Practice
in doing Good, and the like; that you, who have been
bred among Hereticks, and in Prejudices again&s;t their
Religion, and e&s;pecially again&s;t their Orders, may be
convinc'd by &s;uch undeniable Proofs, that they are
not the People that they have been repre&s;ented; that
they are not Murtherers and Thieves, but Chri&s;tians;
and that they practi&s;e the Works of Charity, and
doing Good, without Di&s;tinction, to all Men, accord|ing
to the ble&s;&s;ed Rule of the Scriptures.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, even this has no Harm in it, for
no Man can be blam'd for de&s;iring not to be mi&s;re|pre&s;ented.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, if that was all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>If the re&s;t is of the &s;ame kind, I &s;hould
think &s;till, it mu&s;t be very good.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But there is &s;till the Poi&s;on of A&s;ps under their
Lips; there is a Snare laid deep as Hell under all
this; and that not to delude your Body, or dip into
your Pur&s;e, or to make a Gain of you; as I &s;aid
before, they act above all that; but to in&s;nare the
Soul, and draw you into the Arms of their Church,
&s;o to pervert your Principles, and deceive you every
way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can they think to pervert my Principles,
by doing Good?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="24" REF="38">
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is no My&s;tery at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do nor &s;ee into it, Sir, indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that is the very Rea&s;on of my Fear; there
is the main Danger I am warning you of; for if once
you &s;ee it, the Danger is over; you know the Text,
<HI>In vain is the Net &s;pread in the Sight of the Bird.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I acknowledge, if there is a Snare in all this,
'tis very well to be forewarn'd, for there is nothing
more dangerous than a Hypocrite.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, they are not Hypocrites neither; for,
fir&s;t, their Habits tell you what they profe&s;s, and
the Artifice u&s;ed, is to wheedle you into a good Opi|nion
of their Profe&s;&s;ion; all that Part is real and above|board.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where, then, Sir, can the Danger of them
lie?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why this is the Ca&s;e; by all that officious
Kindne&s;s and Goodne&s;s, they fir&s;t make their Ac|quaintance
with you, and in&s;inuating gradually, they
form an Intere&s;t in you, upon Point of Friend&s;hip
only: In this Friend&s;hip, having a large Share in
your Conver&s;ation, they carry it with the utmo&s;t Im|partiality
between your Opinions and theirs; pretend
to value you for being true to your own Principles,
and &s;trongly in&s;i&s;t, that you cannot like them wor&s;e,
for the like Fidelity to theirs; and thus keeping things
upon a Balance, they act only the Friend&s;hip ab|&s;tracted
from Religion, for a great while.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, does this a&s;&s;i&s;t their De&s;ign, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very much; for this breaks in upon your
Prejudices again&s;t them, as a cruel, a bloody, a fal&s;e
and treacherous Generation, which yet you will be
&s;ure to find them at la&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Prejudices, I believe, Sir, are too well
rooted to be ea&s;ily removed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>If yours are, and I hope it is &s;o, yet every
one is not in the &s;ame Ca&s;e: With the&s;e they carry
on the Profe&s;&s;ion of Friend&s;hip as high as po&s;&s;ible,
<PB N="25" REF="39">
till, by innumerable Acts of Kindne&s;s and di&s;intere&s;ted
Benefactions, &s;uch as I mentioned ju&s;t now, they get
ground in&s;en&s;ibly upon you; till they bring you, fir&s;t,
into love with their Per&s;ons, and at la&s;t with their
Principles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confe&s;s, Sir, the Treatment you &s;poke of
ju&s;t now, is extraordinary, and cannot fail to oblige;
it is impo&s;&s;ible, almo&s;t, not to be in love with any
Gentleman, who &s;hould treat a Man in &s;uch a Manner
as that, and in a &s;trange Country too; but then you
&s;ay, Sir, this is not the Prie&s;t, but &s;ome other Per|&s;on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is &s;o, and a Per&s;on, to be &s;ure, of no mean
Figure, for they never want &s;uch; nor does the
Gentleman him&s;elf do it with any &s;eeret De&s;ign of
Fraud, but that I am &s;peaking of, namely, the re|ligious
Fraud; but being a Zealot too him&s;elf, and
Bigot enough to think it is meritorious, and will be
the Advantage of his Soul, to endeavour the &s;aving
of yours, he is brought in by the Prie&s;t, as I &s;aid,
to act all this upon a mere Principle of &s;upererrogating
Charity and Goodne&s;s, and therefore you are in no
Danger of any other Cheat in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>The re&s;t mu&s;t be couch'd very clo&s;e then, for
'tis cover'd with &s;o much Chri&s;tianity, and &s;o much
generous Kindne&s;s, that I confe&s;s I cannot &s;ee thro'
it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, let me go on with it then; for they will
carry it a great way farther yet, I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am, indeed, a little &s;urpriz'd with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>When you have received the Bounty offer'd
you, &s;uppo&s;ing you had Occa&s;ion of it, you can do
no le&s;s than acknowledge the generous Favour;
perhaps, Ju&s;tice will move you to offer to give a Note
under your Hand, or Acknowledgment, or Obligation
for it, or, perhaps, a Bill of Exchange, according
as your own Circum&s;tances may admit, for I am not
&s;peaking ju&s;t of Your Circum&s;tances in particular,
<PB N="26" REF="40">
but of the ordinary Ca&s;es that may happen to any
Gentleman-Stranger on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I under&s;tand it, Sir, ju&s;t as I believe you mean;
no doubt I &s;hould make &s;uch an Offer: any Man
that had a Sen&s;e of the thing, would do &s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, he is &s;ure to refu&s;e it with the &s;ame Ge|nero&s;ity,
and 'tis ten to one, but he talks to you thus:
No, Sir, no, by no means; I don't de&s;ire any Re|compence:
Our holy Religion teaches us not to give,
in order to receive again; if your Circum&s;tances re|quire
it as a Gift, there is one that will take care of my
Payment (pointing to the <HI>Padre,</HI> who, he &s;ugge&s;ts, will
record his Charity in Heaven for him) and if you are
above the want of it, Sir, I take your Word of Honour
for it, that yon will pay unto <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> to whom I
a&s;&s;ign the Loan, by giving it in his Name to &s;uch of
his poor Servants as your own Charity &s;hall direct,
and as his Grace &s;hall lay in your Way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is &s;till a Prodigy of &s;incere Charity,
and &s;eems &s;o founded on the Cnri&s;tian Doctrine, that
'tis hard, &s;o much as to &s;u&s;pect it: But pray, Sir, be
pleas'd to go on with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>When you have acquainted them where you
purpo&s;e to go next; &s;uppo&s;e you were before at <HI>Turin,</HI>
and de&s;ign next to go to <HI>Genoa,</HI> or take it where el&s;e
you will, the next Day the Gentleman is &s;ure to &s;end
the <HI>Padre</HI> or Prie&s;t to you, to de&s;ire you to dine with
him, or to meet him, in the Refectory of the Abbey,
which is as much as to &s;ay, I invite you to dine with
the Prie&s;t.</P>

<P>Nay we with Safety, eat with them in their
Religious Hou&s;es?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, they treat you there with the utmo&s;t
Civility; you have not, perhaps, all the Formalities
of a Fea&s;t; but you have what we call a Cold Treat,
with abundance of Con&s;erves, Sweetmeats, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and
the be&s;t Wine, to be &s;ure, that is in the Country:
the Gentleman gives you his Letters of Recom|mendation
<PB N="27" REF="41">
to the Eminent Per&s;on he promi&s;ed, and
you are &s;ure to have it in all the Terms of Civility
imaginable; and as to Money, 'tis a mere Letter of
Credit to you, without &s;o much as asking whether
you want it or not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is all &s;trange indeed, Sir; but does he not
tell me, that there is a borrowing Clau&s;e in the Letter,
and that 'tis, as you &s;ay, Sir, a Letter of Credit?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, not directly; but when he puts it into
your Hand, he will &s;ay, Sir, my Friend will not let
you want any thing your Occa&s;ions may call for, if
you &s;hew him this Letter; &s;o di&s;mi&s;&s;es you with all
po&s;&s;ible Civilities, de&s;iring the Favour of your Cor|re&s;pondence
in your Travels.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and then I am gone, Sir; and yet I do
not &s;ee the Harm you were plea&s;ed to &s;ay there was in
all this: Where lies the Plot of it all?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hall bring you on to it gradually, Son, as
they do: When the Gentleman has thus taken his
Leave of you, the <HI>Padre</HI> comes to you, and begs
the Favour of you, that you will take a Letter or
two from him in your Pocket; that you will permit
your Servant to deliver them when you come to
<HI>Genoa,</HI> intimating that one of them, which he &s;hews
you in particular, is to a Brother of their Order,
who, he knows, will think it a Favour, if you will ac|cept
of the u&s;ual Civilities of their Profe&s;&s;ion, and
will be &s;ure to &s;hew you all the Rarities of the Place,
and, in a Word, to pay to you all the Re&s;pect po&s;&s;ible,
as you are a Stranger. The Gentleman having di&s;|charged
his Civilities, as I told you, has taken his
Leave and is gone, and the good <HI>Padre,</HI> with, per|haps,
another, entertains you afterwards; carries you
all over the Hou&s;e, &s;hews you how religiou&s;ly they
&s;pend their Hours, and yet how agreeably they live;
and then brings you into his Cell, where he regales
you with Sweetmeats again, and Wine; then &s;hews
you his Books, if he has any, for as the Hou&s;e has a
<PB N="28" REF="42">
publick Library, the Prie&s;ts have not always many
Books of their own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>All this is very well yet, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here he takes Occa&s;ion to enter into Di&s;cour&s;e
with you upon any Subject, &s;uch as by his former
Conver&s;ation he finds mo&s;t &s;uited to your Genius,
whether of Philo&s;ophy, or Phy&s;ick, or Hi&s;tory, or
Politicks; talks of the War, if any upon the Stage,
or if not, of the la&s;t that have been, and of the In|tere&s;t
of the &s;everal Parties; &s;till avoids any Di&s;cour&s;e
of Religion; but fails not to tell you, that he &s;huns
it in good Manners to your being of a different Opini|on;
not but that he prays devoutly to <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI>
and with that he lifts up his Eyes and Hands, that
you &s;hould be in&s;pired by Divine Grace, to come in|to
the Pale of the Church, and to embrace the Ca|tholick
Faith, adding, with an Air of Affection, how
&s;en&s;ibly it touches him, that &s;o fine a Gentleman as
you, and of &s;o bright a Genius, &s;hould be &s;o long
before the heavenly Illumination &s;hould reach your
Soul; and that, however, he is a&s;&s;ur'd you &s;hall be
ble&s;s'd from Chri&s;t, with &s;aving In&s;pirations in his
due time: This is very good, you will &s;ay, in its
kind; and it is &s;o, and I may venture to &s;ay of &s;ome
of them, that they think as they &s;peak; however,
even this he brings in very &s;eldom, and never but as
if forc'd from him by the Di&s;cour&s;e you were upon,
and he always ends it with asking your Pardon for
the Excur&s;ion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I begin to ob&s;erve there is &s;ome Subtlety in
all this, Sir; but it &s;eems all to be very friendly and
&s;incere: &s;uppo&s;ing we are to grant they believe them|&s;elves
in the right Way, and in the only right Way
to Heaven, I cannot &s;ee any Evil in it yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not charge them with Evil, they compa&s;s
Sea and Land to make a Pro&s;elyte; but the Evil lies
in the Effect of it upon you, or the Per&s;on I am
&s;uppo&s;ing to be the Object; the Mi&s;chief is in the
<PB N="29" REF="43">
Danger of being &s;educ'd by this Exce&s;s of Kindne&s;s
and Charity, to enter into the Merits of their Cau&s;e,
and to commence Di&s;putes; which they always chu&s;e
to fix upon the le&s;s di&s;puted Points of Religion, en|deavouring
to let you &s;ugge&s;t that it is the &s;ame Je&s;us
they wor&s;hip, which we al&s;o acknowledge; how or|thodox
and uniform they are in their Belief of his
Deity, and their Adoration of his Per&s;on; and, at
la&s;t, what little Difference there is between us and
them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>This, Sir, is always &s;uppo&s;ing a Man will
enter into the Debate with them; not el&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very difficult to avoid it, at lea&s;t now and
then a little.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, as I &s;aid before, this is but for a
Day or two, or a Week, or as long as I &s;tay in the
Place; but the next Day or two, perhaps, I am
gone; and then there is an End of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are quite mi&s;taken; they begin the Work,
and the Compliment made you by the Gentleman,
intangles you yet farther when you come to <HI>Genoa;</HI>
for at the &s;ame time that you are loaded afre&s;h with
new Civilities from the Per&s;on you are recommended
to, he is &s;ecretly advertis'd that the Religeu&s;e have been
with you; that's enough, the Meaning is, they have
made &s;ome Progress, have Hopes from the Goodne&s;s
of your Di&s;po&s;ition to prevail; and he under&s;tands
the re&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> that he &s;hould &s;et &s;ome more upon you:
Be&s;ides this, the Letters the Prie&s;t gave you to deli|ver
to &s;ome of the Brotherhood, fail not to have
this Expre&s;&s;ion, Pray omit not to do all the good
Offices of Civility to this Gentleman, which, as he
is a Stranger and a Gentleman, Ho&s;pitality requires.
He gives you this Letter open, that you may &s;ee
what he writes; and tho' you &s;ee nothing to give
you the lea&s;t Intimation of their De&s;ign, they per|fectly
under&s;tand one another; nay, at the Place of
&s;igning the Letter, they always make the Sign of the
<PB N="30" REF="44">
Cro&s;s with the Name; and the Padre to whom it is
written knows the Meaning of it exactly, only by
ob&s;erving either the Place where it is &s;o &s;et, or the
Number of Cro&s;&s;es, or &s;ome other particular Mark
about it; as &s;uppo&s;e in&s;tead of a plain Cro&s;s thus &dagger;,
it &s;hall have the Addition only of a Dot or Speck, as
if dropt by Accident from the Pen, thus&dagger;; by that
Part of the Cro&s;s where the Speck lies, the Per&s;on
perfectly under&s;tands his Meaning, and there he
intimates that he has made &s;ome Progre&s;s and Hopes
for Succe&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>This indeed, Sir, intimates that they carry on
the &s;ame De&s;ign every where.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It does &s;o; and as they &s;uppo&s;e that the Cen|tre
of your Travel is, for &s;ome time at lea&s;t, ap|pointed
at the Vatican, this Strain of Civility never
leaves you till you come to <HI>Rome;</HI> and you are thus
recommended from City to City, and, as it were,
loaded with Kindne&s;&s;es and good Offices to the very
Place: There you are pre&s;ently &s;urrounded with
new Favours, and carry'd to all the publick Places,
&s;hew'd all the Rarities, and even the Pope him&s;elf;
and particularly you are introduc'd to &s;ome of the
Cardinals, the Favourite, in e&s;pecial Manner, by
whom you are receiv'd in a Manner &s;o obliging, that,
in a Word, 'tis no &s;mall Hazard that you are over|come
with the Care&s;&s;es and Compliments of the&s;e
People in Matters of Conver&s;ation only, and they
&s;end away many a Gentleman even pro&s;elyted by
their Favours; nor is it often that they fail to make
Impre&s;&s;ions upon tho&s;e which they attack in this
Manner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;ee into it now indeed, Sir; it is certain they
manage with a Perfection of Art and Subtlety.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Add to this, that all the while you &s;tay at
<HI>Rome,</HI> you &s;ee the Pomp and Glory of their Religi|on,
which even in it&s;elf goes a great Way, and
makes great Impre&s;&s;ion on the Mind; as no doubt
<PB N="31" REF="45">
the Magnificence and immen&s;e Riches of the Temple
of <HI>Solomon</HI> did upon the Nations adjoining to <HI>Judea,</HI>
to bring Pro&s;elytes to their Religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>That might do in tho&s;e Days, Sir, perhaps,
more than it does &s;ince.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It preys upon unin&s;tructed Minds; many are
in Love with the Pomp of Religion; and when they
are not well grounded in the Simplicity of the Go&s;pel,
are ea&s;ily drawn a&s;ide.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope there is no Danger of me, Sir, in that
Point; you have not brought me up in Ignorance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That reproaches me very &s;everely; for I have
not added &s;o much to your religious In&s;truction as I
&s;hould have done, and as I might have done, if I
had been careful of my Duty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think you have been very careful of me,
Sir; have you not given me the Advantage of a libe|ral
Education, and &s;ent me to the great Nur&s;ery of
Learning the University? Tho' it is true I want a
great deal; yet whatever I want, it is not my Fa|ther's
Fault, but my own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't &s;ay that, Son: 'Tis true, I &s;ent you to
the Univer&s;ity; but I doubt tho', we may rather call
it a Nur&s;ery of Learning than of Religion: I like
their Philo&s;ophy better than their Divinity; they
make more Scholars than Chri&s;tians.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be true that there is not &s;o much Care
of the religious Principles of the Youth who &s;tudy
there, as there might be, yet a Man may gain a
Fund of orthodox Principles there, if he will apply
to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>We won't di&s;pute that now, Son; but De|mon&s;tration
is on my Side: how many well-read
Athei&s;ts, and learned Hereticks, do we &s;ee come
fini&s;h'd in Error from the Univer&s;ities, and begin to
propagate corrupt Doctrines as &s;oon as they come
from the Schools? But that is not the Ca&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="32" REF="46">
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is it then, Sir? What would you have
me &s;ay to this Point?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is the Bottom indeed of all my Di&s;cour&s;e;
It is, in &s;hort, this, That, as I know you will not
fail to be attack'd with all po&s;&s;ible Artifice, as I have
&s;aid, in order to wheedle you out of your own Opi|nion,
or, at lea&s;t, into a good Opinion of theirs;
&s;o you, or any one el&s;e, who have any Value for
the true Religion, ought not to go abroad, till they are
thoroughly fortify'd again&s;t the Subtlety and Artifice
of the craftie&s;t People in the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>How mu&s;t any Body be thoroughly fortify'd,
Sir? It mu&s;t be a &s;pecial Work upon the Mind, and
wrought there by a &s;uperior Hand, that mu&s;t, and
only can, effectually fortify the Soul again&s;t the Delu|&s;ions
of Error.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very glad to hear you &s;ay &s;o, Son; you
are very right, and 'tis the Spirit of God alone; that,
as he is the Comforter and the Sanctifier of his Peo|ple,
&s;o is he their In&s;tructor, their Guide into all
Truth, and their Keeper in the Truth, <HI>John</HI> xvi. 13.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>This then being the Ca&s;e, what need we fear
the Delu&s;ions of Error, and the In&s;inuations of the
Prie&s;ts? I do not &s;ee what I have to do, but to be
forewarn'd, as you are pleas'd to do, and leave the
re&s;t to a higher Hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, there is more than that to be done; for
I think you huddle Things up too clo&s;e, and bring it
all into too narrow a Compa&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not under&s;tand you, Sir: If there be
any thing el&s;e, I de&s;ire to know it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is for this Rea&s;on that I de&s;ir'd to talk with
you: I &s;hall explain my&s;elf in &s;everal Particulars,
and &s;uch as I &s;hall expect you to think immediately
upon.</P>
</SP>
<P>1. No young Gentleman ought to travel into Coun|tries
of different Religions, till he is thoroughly ground|ed
in the Principles of his own.</P>
<SP>
<PB N="33" REF="47">
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how, Sir, mu&s;t I under&s;tand the Words
thoroughly grounded?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very glad you ask me that Que&s;tion. By
being thoroughly grounded in his Principles, I
mean,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That he is a compleat Convert to Religion in
general, (<HI>viz.</HI>) fully convinc'd of the Being of
God, the Object of all Religion; fully con|vinc'd
that every Man ought to be of &s;ome
Religion or other, that &s;o he may pay his
natural Homage to God, in the be&s;t Manner
he is able, and in the Way mo&s;t agreeable to
his Will, and thankfully &s;atisfied that the Re|ligion
he profe&s;&s;es is that one and only be&s;t,
which is &s;o &s;uitable to the God he is to wor|&s;hip,
and will be accepted by him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That he has &s;o well informed him&s;elf of this,
that he is able to defend the Principles he has
entertain'd, and to give an Account of his
Faith where-ever he comes, and in the Teeth
of Gain&s;ayers.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That tho' he may not be able &s;o far to ma|nage
a Di&s;pute, in Defence of his Principles,
as to overthrow all that oppo&s;e him, yet, that
he may be able &s;o to defend them, as to under|&s;tand
him&s;elf, and not to receive a Shock in
his Faith, for not being able to baffle the So|phi&s;try
of every cavilling querulous Prie&s;t that
may attack him.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>In a Word, he &s;hould be fully per&s;uaded of the
Truth of the Prote&s;tant Religion, and &s;teadily re|&s;olv'd
in the Faith of it, otherwise he ought never
to venture him&s;elf Abroad: But, take this with you
<PB N="34" REF="48">
too, that he is not to reject the Teaching, and
Guiding, of a &s;uperior Light.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot &s;ay, indeed, that I may be able to
an&s;wer and confute all the Prie&s;ts, or other Champi|ons,
of the Popi&s;h Religion; for I have never &s;et up
for a Ca&s;ui&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tho' you could not confute them, it would
be nece&s;&s;ary for you to keep them from confuting
you; for it will be very hard for you to continue of
any Opinion that you cannot defend, or not to be
of that Religion which you cannot confute.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is more, indeed, in that, Sir, than I
had yet thought of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is &s;o much in it, that I &s;hould be very
loth to give my Con&s;ent for your going abroad, till
you have taken &s;ome Steps in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>What would you plea&s;e to have me do, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, the fir&s;t Thing, I mean, as to Human
Means, is this: I would have you take &s;ome Pains
with your &s;elf, and &s;tudy, a little, the Controver&s;y
between Popery and the Prote&s;tant Religion. I
have a great many very good Tracts, in my Library,
wherein, all that has or can be &s;aid, on both Sides,
is, I believe, &s;umm'd up, and di&s;puted. Take &s;ome
Time, and make your &s;elf fully Ma&s;ter of the great
Que&s;tions between us; the Doctrine of Tran&s;ub&s;tan|tiation;
of Image-Wor&s;hip; the Ab&s;urdity of ado|ring
the Relicks of dead Saints; Human Pardons,
for Offences again&s;t Divine Power, and, which is
&s;till more ab&s;urd, buying tho&s;e Pardons for Money;
al&s;o, &s;elling Indulgences, and Licences, to &s;in
again&s;t God; a few of the&s;e will furni&s;h you, Son.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you were &s;aying, ju&s;t now, That there
is &s;ome Danger from the Pomp, and Gaiety, of Po|pery,
when we come into tho&s;e Countries, where it
is all &s;o fine, and &s;o rich.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly Son, I know it has been fatal to &s;ome
weak Heads; but, I think, a little Stock of Re|flection
<PB N="35" REF="49">
will furni&s;h you again&s;t that: I have &s;een
all the Legerdemain of the Prie&s;ts, and of their
Wor&s;hip; and, I mu&s;t &s;ay, that if the Subtlety of
the Prie&s;ts, their Sophi&s;try in Argument, and the
U&s;e they make of tho&s;e pompous Things, does not
in&s;nare and captivate the Mind, I am per&s;uaded,
very few Prote&s;tants would ever be perverted by
what they &s;hould &s;ee; for that, (I mean in their
publick Wor&s;hip) e&s;pecially, take it in the Gro&s;s, and
particularly as practi&s;ed Abroad, 'tis &s;uch a Piece of
Pageantry, &s;uch a Puppet Show of Religion, that
nothing of a well in&s;tructed Mind can be in any
Danger from the Sight of it; it would make a Man of
Sen&s;e rather de&s;pi&s;e and abhor them, e&s;pecially, when
he is, I &s;ay, prepar'd to do &s;o by proper Advices.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>What would you plea&s;e to direct me to,
Sir, in order to prepare my Thoughts beforehand,
&s;o as to make a right Judgment of the&s;e Things,
when I come to &s;ee them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad you propo&s;e the Que&s;tion in that
Manner, for this is bringing the Bu&s;ine&s;s into as
narrow a Compa&s;s as we can: I'll lay down a Scheme
for you in a few Words.</P>
<P><LIST>
<ITEM>1. Be&s;tow a little Reading upon the Original of
the Chri&s;tian Religion, and enter into the Chro|nology
of Things, from the fir&s;t planting the
Go&s;pel in the World.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Then enter di&s;tinctly into the Hi&s;tory of the
Primitive Times, and there you will &s;ee, very
clearly, 1. In what Purity the Chri&s;tian Doc|trine
was fir&s;t preach'd; what it really is, and
what the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians practis'd. 2. By what
Degrees it became corrupt; how Error, Ido|latry,
Super&s;tition, Enthu&s;ia&s;m, and the Doc|ctrine
of Devils crept in; all which were &s;up|ported,
as they were introduced, by Church
<PB N="36" REF="50">
Tyranny, and abominable Impo&s;ition, which
is the E&s;&s;ence of Popery.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Then make your &s;elf Ma&s;ter of the Prote&s;tant
Doctrine, the Principles which we profe&s;s; the
Rea&s;on and Foundation of them; how e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd
in Truth; directed by, and founded in
the Holy Scriptures; confirmed by the Writings
and Practice of the Primitive Fathers of Chri&s;ti|anity,
and &s;ealed with the Te&s;timony of their
Blood.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Then look into the Hi&s;tory of the Reforma|tion,
and &s;ee the Rea&s;on why, and the Manner
how, the fir&s;t Reformers broke off from the
<HI>Romi&s;h,</HI> which was then call'd, tho' fal&s;ly, the
univer&s;al Church.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>If you look into the&s;e four Particulars, and &s;earch
impartially into the Original of Truth, you will
find this the be&s;t Way to confirm your Principles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a Study, that requires a grave Ap|plication,
and long Time: I believe you do not
de&s;ign me, Sir, for a Clergyman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a little &s;hort upon me, <HI>Son;</HI> I do not
de&s;ign to make a Prie&s;t of you, it's true, but I
would make a Chri&s;tian of you, and every Chri&s;tian
Man ought to &s;tudy Principles: I hope you do not
think that the Study of Truth belongs only to the
Clergy, and that we are to apply to them only for
our Knowledge of it; that's Popery, indeed, in the
very Ab&s;tract.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not think we &s;hould go to them in plain
Ca&s;es, but, in di&s;puted Points, I think they, who&s;e
Bu&s;ine&s;s it is to &s;tudy tho&s;e Things, &s;hould be always
ready to in&s;truct their People.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, they &s;hould, but their People too &s;hould
endeavour to be able to judge of the In&s;tructions
<PB N="37" REF="51">
they give, as you &s;eem to do now (and a little too
far, I think,) of my plain Advices</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would not offend you, Sir: But if they are not
our Teachers in difficult Ca&s;es, what Bu&s;ine&s;s have
they with us, or we with them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, a great deal, they are Teachers, and we
ought to li&s;ten to their Teaching; but not &s;o as to
give up our Sen&s;es to their <HI>Po&s;itives,</HI> or <HI>Negatives,</HI>
and look no farther: Even our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, the
only infallible Teacher that ever was on Earth, re|fers
us even beyond him&s;elf, and bids his Di&s;ciples
&s;earch the Scriptures, <HI>For they,</HI> &s;ays our Lord, <HI>are
they which te&s;tify of me.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hould, indeed, Sir, de&s;ire to be &s;atisfied
that the Clergyman I talk with, is an hone&s;t di&s;inte|re&s;ted
Man, and then I &s;hould be apt to depend very
much upon what he &s;ays.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you are as fit to be turn'd into a Papi&s;t,
as a Popi&s;h Emi&s;&s;ary could wi&s;h to talk with, and
this is the very Thing I have been &s;peaking of. I
am very &s;orry my Di&s;cour&s;e has made no farther Im|pre&s;&s;ion
than this upon you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope, Sir, you will hear the Rea&s;ons of
what I &s;ay, before you draw &s;uch a hard Conclu&s;ion.
I think, Sir, in the fir&s;t place, an hone&s;t Man will
not impo&s;e upon any Body.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you, Son, the&s;e are hone&s;t Men; at lea&s;t
I'll &s;uppo&s;e they are, and that they do not go about
to impo&s;e upon you: they believe them&s;elves to be in
the Right, and 'tis a very hone&s;t Principle if we are
fir&s;t &s;atisfied we are right, to endeavour to bring
others to be &s;o too; why el&s;e do all People bring
up their Children in their own Way? you cannot
&s;uppo&s;e they would willingly impo&s;e upon their own
Children, and deceive them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>The&s;e are Arguments on my Side; I &s;hall
always believe I am &s;afe with &s;uch People as will not
de&s;ignedly impo&s;e upon me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="38" REF="52">
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But they may be mi&s;taken in the Articles
they per&s;uade to, and then their being hone&s;t makes
them the more dangerous, for having been impos'd on
them&s;elves, they impo&s;e upon you in mere Charity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where then &s;hall any Man be &s;afe, if he is
in Danger from hone&s;t Men?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Hone&s;t Men may not always embrace hone&s;t
Principles, they may be deceiv'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I mu&s;t be as cautious as I can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I think that &s;hews a great Indifference in the
Ca&s;e, as if it was of &s;mall Con&s;equence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>When I have done all that I can, Sir, I mu&s;t
venture it, or not go Abroad at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>You had much better not go Abroad at all,
than to go Abroad among Enemies, and be unpro|vided
for your Defence; 'tis going blindfold into a
<HI>Bear-garden.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you di&s;appoint me, Sir, in the main
Part of my Education; which depends much upon
this Propo&s;al of Travelling, and which you had al|ready
con&s;ented to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did con&s;ent to your Travelling, but hop'd
you would not have made a Difficulty of my giving
you needful Cautions to prevent the Ruin of your
Principles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not oppo&s;e being caution'd; but, Sir,
the Propo&s;al, you make, is the Work of an Age:
I ought to lock my &s;elf up in a Study &s;even Years
for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, nor one Year, nor half a Year; I
would propo&s;e but &s;ix Months for you, provided you
would give &s;ome Application to it for that &s;ix
Months, and look up to God to give A&s;&s;i&s;tance to
your Enquiries, and to add the Divine Illuminations
of his Spirit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe, the la&s;t of it &s;elf would be &s;ufficient
without the fir&s;t; the Divine Teaching is able to open
the Under&s;tanding without Study.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="39" REF="53">
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true, Son; but you really bring that
Argument as if it were to excu&s;e the Application;
I &s;hould be glad my Sugge&s;tion could be call'd un|ju&s;t;
God's Grace attends the ordinary Means, and
&s;eldom acts by Miracles: In&s;pirations are very much
cea&s;ed, if not quite.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope you may venture me, Sir, upon the
Force of the Cautions you have already given.</P>
</SP>

<P>I cannot think otherwi&s;e, unle&s;s where I &s;ee

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well! and how &s;hall you &s;ee that, but
by entering a little into the State of the Ca&s;e be|tween
them and you, between the Prote&s;tant and
the Papi&s;t? that is, the very Thing I argue upon;
that you may put your &s;elf into a Capacity to judge
whether they are wright or wrong, mi&s;taken or not
mi&s;taken.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I think I am &s;ufficiently prepar'd: I am not
an utter Stranger to the Controver&s;y.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, I &s;ee evidently, you do not lay &s;o much
Stre&s;s upon it, as I think the Ca&s;e requires; you
think there's no Danger, and that's the very E&s;&s;ence
of Danger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not &s;ay, there is no Danger, Sir; but,
as I re&s;olve to be as cautious as I can, I hope the
Danger is not &s;o great, and, I am for venturing, if
you plea&s;e, unle&s;s you positively forbid me, which,
I hope, you will not, after having promi&s;ed me.</P>

which makes me &s;till like it the wor&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would not di&s;pute with my Father; but I
mu&s;t &s;ay, I &s;ee no great Hazard in it: and it would
be unkind to put a Stop to my Travels on &s;uch a

<SP>
<PB N="40" REF="54">
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor would I di&s;pute with my Son, in a

unkind.</P>

all the Cautions I have given you, only remember,
that your Father did warn you, and u&s;ed his utmo&s;t
Endeavours to per&s;uade; I am &s;orry you will run

<P>And, I believe, when you return, you will be

<P>I do not &s;ay you &s;hould enter into any Di|&s;putes

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Son, &s;ince you treat the Subject &s;o
coldly, let me ask you a clo&s;e Que&s;tion upon the
Subject of Religion in General: You have read the
Scriptures, you have been taught the Principles of
Religion in your Catechi&s;m, you have not been edu|cated
in Athei&s;tical Notions, or bred up to a Con|tempt
of Religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't &s;hew any Contempt of Religion, Sir,
as I know of, in any of my Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but let me come to my Que&s;tion; How
do you under&s;tand Religion as it relates to the Life
of Man? Is it the chief or ultimate Concern <HI>of Life?</HI>
or is it only an Accident <HI>to Life?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is as we make it to be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is too true in Fact, but my Que&s;tion
does not relate to the Fact, but to the Right; not
what we make it, but what we ought to make it,
what it really is in its own Right, and what we
ought to e&s;teem it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think we often make more Show of Reli|gion
than we need to do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look you, Son, do not &s;huffle with the Que|&s;tion;
I am not di&s;puting with you, but &s;incerely
endeavouring to inform you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not de&s;ire to di&s;pute, and am not back|ward
to be informed, where I am ignorant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am &s;orry you are willing to appear more, ig|norant
than you are; and yet, I cannot but &s;ay, you
are in this main Point more ignorant than I thought
you had been: I will therefore turn my Que&s;tion in|to
a Propo&s;ition, and not to catechi&s;e, but to inform
you; I hope, tho' you are pa&s;t the fir&s;t, you will
allow your Father the Liberty of the la&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="42" REF="56">
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very willing, as I &s;aid before, to be
informed if I am ignorant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you are not ignorant, <HI>as I &s;aid before,</HI> i$
you are cold and indifferent, 'tis the &s;ame Thing $word$
this Ca&s;e; only that the latter is the wor&s;t; but i$
&s;hall &s;peak of that afterward: In the mean Time
take my Thoughts about Religion, thus:
<Q><P>The Belief of the Being <HI>of a God</HI> is the fir$$
Principle; 'tis the fir&s;t Truth Nature dictates$
That a Homage is due to that <HI>God,</HI> as the fir&s;$
and Supreme Power, is the next.</P>
<P>The Manner how that Homage is to be paid$
is the third; and this we call Religion.</P></Q></P>
<P>As the Supreme Power, &s;o acknowledged, is, an$
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be our ultimate End, becau&s;e h$
is and was our fir&s;t Cau&s;e; &s;o paying the Homag$
due to him, is the undoubted Debt and Duty of ou$
Nature; and con&s;equently, the performing it in $word$
right Manner, <HI>which is Religion,</HI> is, and ought to b$
the mo&s;t important Article of Life.</P>
<P>Thus, Son, by &s;hort and nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equences$
I form a Propo&s;ition, which I offer to your Rea&s;on$
deny it if you can.</P>
<P>That Religion, or the right wor&s;hipping of God,
is the mo&s;t important Article of Life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not pretend, Sir, to di&s;pute with my
Father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Son, I am not drawing you to di&s;pute&punc;
here is no Room for it; here is nothing doubtful o$
di&s;putable.</P>
</SP>
<P>If you deny my Propo&s;ition, that the right per|forming
our Homage to God is of &s;uch Importance,
you mu&s;t deny the Homage it &s;elf to be a Debt.</P>
<P>If you deny the Homage to be due, you mu&s;t
deny the Per&s;on to whom it is due to be Supreme&punc;
<PB N="43" REF="57">
for the Supreme mu&s;t claim a Right to our Submi&s;|&s;ion,
which is Homage.</P>
<P>If you deny him to be Supreme, you mu&s;t deny
him to be Prior, the fir&s;t Cau&s;e and Creator of our
Being; for whatever is before all, mu&s;t be above
all.</P>
<P>If you deny him to be the fir&s;t Cau&s;e of Being,
you mu&s;t deny him to be GOD; for, whatever is
before all Being, mu&s;t Be and Exi&s;t infinitely, and
in him&s;elf; and whatever is Infinite and Self-exi&s;tent,
mu&s;t be GOD.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I make no An&s;wer, Sir; I am to hear you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Sy&s;tem is perfect, it is a Chain of Con|&s;equences;
there is no Room for an An&s;wer, unle&s;s,
as above, you will deny Principles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope I am no Athei&s;t, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and I hope &s;o too, and I go upon that
Suppo&s;ition; let me then proceed.</P>
<Q><P>If Religion is the chief Concern of Life, the
mo&s;t important Article, and on which our
Eternal Felicity depends; then it is of the ut|mo&s;t
Con&s;equence to us, that we be thorough|ly
and rightly informed concerning this Thing
called <HI>Religion;</HI> and that more e&s;pecially, be|cau&s;e
fatal Mi&s;takes, Errors, and Here&s;ies, are
crept into the World about it, and that there
is a fal&s;e as well as a true Religion.</P>
<P>By being rightly informed concerning Religion,
I mean this &s;hort Point, <HI>viz.</HI> That when we
pay that Homage to the Great Supreme
Power, and which, as I mentioned above,
we acknowledge to be our Debt and Duty, we
&s;hould do it in &s;uch a Manner as is agreeable
to his revealed Word and Will; or, <HI>in &s;hort,</HI>
&s;o as he will be be&s;t plea&s;ed with it: And this,
whether it re&s;pects, (1.) What we are to be|lieve
<PB N="44" REF="58">
concerning him; or (2.) What we are
to do and perform in Wor&s;hipping and Obey|ing
him.</P></Q>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, we find the World infinitely divided
in their Opinions about the&s;e Things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That does not at all le&s;&s;en the Importance of
our being at a Certainty about them, but increa&s;es
it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I grant it does not le&s;&s;en it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Son; then &s;till my Propo&s;ition &s;tands
unmov'd, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that <HI>Religion</HI> is the mo&s;t impor|tant
Article of Life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, I do not pretend to oppo&s;e it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well; then my Son will allow, I hope,
that I have great Rea&s;on to lay all the Stre&s;s imagi|nable,
upon what I was per&s;uading him to, <HI>namely,</HI>
to be thoroughly fixed in his Principles, in this im|portant
Thing called RELIGION, before he ventures
Abroad among tho&s;e who, profe&s;&s;ing erroneous and
mi&s;taken Opinions them&s;elves, will u&s;e their utmo&s;t

<P>You are too many for me, Sir; I &s;aid before,
I would not di&s;pute.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, It is not that I am too many for
you; it is the Energy of this weighty Truth, <HI>That
Religion is the main Concern of Life;</HI> 'tis that which
bears down all before it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But were it le&s;s demon&s;trable, yet, your Way

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tho' that's a Compliment upon your Father,
'tis a Satyr upon your &s;elf, in the very Ca&s;e before

you, tho' in a Ca&s;e le&s;s demon&s;trable; <HI>Ware
Popery!</HI> That is the very Thing that I &s;aid above; The
Subtlety and Sophi&s;try of the Prie&s;ts may be too many

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but if then you own the Danger, and
that in a Ca&s;e of the highe&s;t Importance, why are
you inclin'd to venture? This brings me to the other

<P>That's Univer&s;ity Work too; it's too late

<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Son, if it be <HI>too late for you</HI> to e&s;tabli&s;h
your &s;elf, in Matters of the utmo&s;t Importance, it
would be much <HI>too &s;oon,</HI> I mu&s;t tell you, <HI>for me</HI> to
&s;end you Abroad into the World without it; I can|not
do it, take it as you plea&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<P>Here the Son broke off the Di&s;cour&s;e a little rude|ly,
murmuring at the Thing as unkind in general;
intimating, that he would find a Way to go Abroad
without &s;o much Ceremony: All which, the Father,
acting with Prudence, not willing to ruffle his Tem|per,
and put him upon any ra&s;h Re&s;olutions, took
no Notice of.</P>
<P>However, the &s;hort Hi&s;tory of that Part was this;
That applying him&s;elf to an Uncle, his Mother's
Brother, and to &s;ome other Relations, they over-per|&s;uaded
his Father, at length, to let him go Abroad,
which he did, tho' with great Reluctances; and
which, as he often &s;aid, with a &s;incere Sorrow after|wards,
was again&s;t the &s;tronge&s;t Conviction of his
Con&s;cience; foreboding to him&s;elf, that if ever he
went Abroad, he would come back again entirely
ruined in his Principles; and &s;o it prov'd.</P>
<P>Nor was this all, for his Son not only turn'd Pa|pi&s;t,
by a Delu&s;ion of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prie&s;t, who he
found at <HI>Chaalons</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> and who travelled with
him from thence into <HI>Italy;</HI> I &s;ay, he not only turn'd
<PB N="46" REF="61">
Papi&s;t him&s;elf, and as his Father believed, tho' he
would never acknowledge that Part, had taken Or|ders;
but after his Return, he applied him&s;elf, with
his utmo&s;t Skill and Cunning, to draw over his Two
younger Brothers, and, e&s;pecially, one of' his Si&s;ters,
to follow his Example; till his Father, after many
a &s;ore Battle with him in Argument, was oblig'd to
di&s;po&s;e him out of his Family, and almo&s;t forbid
him coming to his Hou&s;e for a Time; but he did
hot keep quite away, as you &s;hall hear in its Order.</P>
<P>After he was gone, the Father apply'd him|&s;elf,
with his utmo&s;t Diligence, to the In&s;truction of
the re&s;t of his Children, in order to fortify them
again&s;t the Attacks which their Popi&s;h Brother had
made upon their Principles; and in which, he had
Difficulty enough, tho' at length he effectually ma|&s;tered
it all.</P>
<P>When he fir&s;t &s;et about this nece&s;&s;ary Work, he
was greatly perplexed with the Ob&s;tinacy, and even
Impertinences, of his elde&s;t Son, who made it a
Piece of Con&s;cience to pervert the Family; and to
that End, his greate&s;t Application was &s;till to counter|act
all the good Foundations which his Father had
lodg'd, by his mo&s;t early In&s;tructions, in the Minds
of his Children, and to per&s;uade them into a Belief
of the contrary Doctrines, upon the Authority of
what he called an infallible Interpreter of Scripture,
namely, the <HI>Pope.</HI></P>
<P>This he did with &s;uch Subtlety and Art, and had
&s;o far in&s;inuated him&s;elf into their weaker Judg|ment,
that the Father found it very difficult to weed
out the Tares which his Son had &s;own, and found,
by &s;ad Experience, that Errors are not only &s;ooner
planted in the Minds of Men, than Truth; but that,
like Weeds in a Garden, being the Natives of the
Soil, they take a deeper Root, and are not &s;o ea&s;ily
cleared out again, as the more &s;olid Truths which
had been e&s;tabli&s;hed there before.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="62">
Upon this Account, he took Two Methods with
his Children; fir&s;t, he avoided, on all Occa&s;ions,
entring into Di&s;putes with his perverted Son, I mean
publick Di&s;putes; but knowing very well, that Po|pery
had rendred it &s;elf ridiculous for &s;ome Ages,
by entertaining the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Ab&s;urdities, and ranging
them among the <HI>Credenda,</HI> or Things to be believ'd;
and that the Prie&s;ts had carried the&s;e Things on to
&s;uch incon&s;i&s;tent, prepo&s;terous Lengths, that them|&s;elves
could not defend them; he always took his
Son by this Handle, and furni&s;hing him&s;elf from
Hi&s;tory, of which he was a complete Ma&s;ter, with
the full Relations of &s;ome of the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing
Enthu&s;ia&s;ms, and &s;urfeiting gro&s;s Pieces of Idolatry
and Popery, that he thought to his Purpo&s;e, his
Son could never propo&s;e any Thing in Di&s;cour&s;e in
Favour of any Popi&s;h Principles, but the Father
would bring in &s;ome Story or other, from good Au|thority,
which &s;hould expo&s;e, not only Popery i$
&s;elf in the gro&s;s, but &s;hould render the Practice of
tho&s;e Principles ab&s;urd and ridiculous in particular.</P>
<P>For Example: One Day, his Son pretended, at
Table, to argue upon, and defend the Supreme Au|thority
of the <HI>Pope</HI> and his Superiority, over the re&s;t
of the Clergy, as univer&s;al Bi&s;hop: His Father
heard him out, and then, not directing his Speech
to his Son, but to his other Children; <HI>Pray,</HI> &s;ays
the Father, <HI>ask your Brother,</HI> how <HI>the Pope</HI> came
by this Superiority? and how long it was before the
Church acknowledged him for <HI>univer&s;al Bi&s;hop?</HI></P>
<P>The Son, too ignorant in Hi&s;tory to deal with his
Father, told them it was always &s;o; he derived it
from St. <HI>Peter,</HI> and that he was acknowledged to be
&s;uch in all Ages: Upon this, the Father, &s;miling at
his Son's Folly, but turning to his elde&s;t Daughter,
Come, <HI>my Dear,</HI> &s;ays he, I'll tell you how this ble&s;|&s;ed
Thing, called the <HI>Pope,</HI> obtained the Title of
<HI>Univer&s;al Bi&s;hop.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="63">
In the Reign of the Emperor <HI>Mauritius,</HI> and
about 590 Years after Chri&s;t, <HI>Gregory,</HI> Sir|named
the Great, being then Bi&s;hop of <HI>Rome,</HI> there
was one <HI>Phocas,</HI> a Soldier or Centurion in the Em|peror's
Guards; a bold, bloody, and enterprizing
Fellow, but of no great Intere&s;t: This <HI>Phocas,</HI> find|ing
Things went but very indifferently at Court, that
the Factions and Parties began to cabal one again&s;t
another, and that the Emperor's Intere&s;t declined
very much, thought he might &s;et up a Party as well
as others; and filling his Head with a&s;piring Thoughts,
began to aim at the Empire.</P>
<P>In thinking of proper In&s;truments to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in
his trea&s;onable De&s;ign, it came to his Mind, that
<HI>Gregory,</HI> the Bi&s;hop <HI>Rome,</HI> had a long Time
&s;truggled for the Title of Univer&s;al Bi&s;hop; but was
always oppo&s;ed by the Emperor <HI>Mauritius,</HI> in Fa|vour
of <HI>John</HI> IV. Bi&s;hop of <HI>Con&s;tantinople:</HI> Upon this,
he propo&s;es to him&s;elf a Scheme of double Villany;
namely, of Trea&s;on and Murther; and &s;o to an&s;wer
both their De&s;igns (<HI>viz.</HI>) that <HI>Phocas</HI> &s;hould mur|ther
the Emperor <HI>Mauritius</HI> and his Son, who were
Enemies to both, and u&s;urp the Throne Imperial:
That upon this Murther, <HI>Gregory</HI> &s;hould acknow|ledge
<HI>Phocas</HI> to be Emperor, and <HI>Phocas,</HI> in return,
would acknowledge <HI>Gregory</HI> to be Univer&s;al Bi&s;hop:
And thus the Supremacy of the Pope, above the
re&s;t of the Bi&s;hops, <HI>&s;ays the Father,</HI> was fir&s;t de&s;ign'd
by a double Con&s;piracy of Trea&s;on and Murther;
and if this be the great Original they have to boa&s;t
of, let them make their be&s;t of it.</P>
<P>It is true, <HI>&s;ays the Father, Gregory</HI> did not live to
take up the Title, for he had written vehemently
again&s;t it; but <HI>Boniface</HI> the Third compleated the
Con&s;piracy, and enjoy'd the Title; and <HI>Gregory</HI> in
his Life Time congratulated the Murtherer. The
Son was horridly a&s;hamed of this Story, and would
fain have &s;ugge&s;ted that it was not true; but his Fa|ther
<PB N="50" REF="64">
offering undoubted Evidence from the mo&s;t
authentick Writers of tho&s;e Times, he had nothing
to &s;ay; and the Si&s;ter, to whom the Father directed
his Di&s;cour&s;e, laugh'd heartily at it; which provok'd
her Brother &s;o much, that he could hardly keep his
Temper with her, and the keen &s;atyrical Girl,
made the more of a Je&s;t about it.</P>
<P>This Method proving thus effectual, his Father
often took the &s;ame Cour&s;e with him; and ever,
when he had the lea&s;t Argument to bring about his
Popi&s;h Trumpery, his Father would confute him,
by telling one Story or other out of Antiquity to ex|po&s;e
it, which always brought his Brothers and Si|&s;ters
to ridicule him, and fail'd not effectually to put
an End to his Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>This, in the End, deliver'd the Family from the
importuning young Ca&s;ui&s;t; tir'd him, and made
him &s;ick of his Attempt to pro&s;elyte his Brother and
Si&s;ter; but the pious anxious Father, greatly concern'd
to &s;ee, that not only the Sophi&s;try of the Prie&s;ts
in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> had perverted and deluded his Son,
and &s;o had robbed him of his elde&s;t Comfort, but
that they had li&s;ted him a Mi&s;&s;ionary for the propaga|ting
Popery in his Family, and had &s;et him on work to
deceive the re&s;t, apply'd him&s;elf very &s;eriou&s;ly to &s;ee
that none, under his Roof, &s;hould be infected with
the Contagion; and therefore, &s;etting apart &s;ome
Time every Day for &s;o good a Work, he entered
&s;olemnly into all the Points of Prote&s;tant and Po|pi&s;h
Doctrine with them, for their fuller In&s;truction.</P>
<P>In doing this, in occurr'd to him, that the only
Way to confirm his Children in the good Principles
he had begun to in&s;till into them, would be to &s;et
Popery in a true Light; to dre&s;s it up in its own
Cloaths, and &s;hew them its Picture drawn to the
Life. That &s;o the Delu&s;ions commonly attending
Popi&s;h Councils might no more prevail on them, and
they might &s;ee what a Mon&s;ter it really was.</P>

<HEAD>DIALOGUE II.</HEAD>
<P>SOME Time after this fir&s;t Broil with the Son,
which the Father, as I have &s;aid, turned off with
a Story; and after which, the Father took all Occa|&s;ions
to talk with his Children upon the &s;ame Subject:
It happened that the &s;econd Son, a young Gentle|man
of about Eighteen Years of Age, who his Fa|ther
had carefully in&s;tructed in &s;ound Principles, fell
into a little Di&s;pute with his elde&s;t Si&s;ter, upon the
Subject of reading Romances.</P>
<P>The Father, who was not in the Room at the begin|ning
of the Debate, came in and out occa&s;ionally &s;eve|ral
Times while it la&s;ted; and at length, &s;et him&s;elf
down to hear it out: they would have &s;topp'd their
Di&s;cour&s;e upon that, but he told them he would
withdraw, rather than they &s;hould break it off, and
that he would be no more than a Hearer; for he
would not influence them in the lea&s;t on one Side or
other; or &s;peak a Word, unle&s;s, on any particular
Occa&s;ion, they ask'd his Opinion.</P>
<P>The Di&s;pute began about the Reading or not
Reading Romances, or fictitious Stories: They were
both, as well Brother as Si&s;ter, again&s;t the Reading
them as a Diver&s;ion, there being no po&s;&s;ible Plea|&s;ure
in reading a Story which we knew to be fal&s;e,
but related as if it were a Truth: But the Si&s;ter
<PB N="52" REF="66">
would have it to be, that it was not fit they &s;hould be
read at all; nay, that it was a Sin; and that, as the
making and writing them was criminal in it&s;elf, be|ing,
as &s;he explained it, what the Scripture meant by
<HI>making a Lye;</HI> &s;o no pretended U&s;e that might be
made of it, could ju&s;tify the Action: And that, if
the writing or publi&s;hing a Romance, was a Lye;
&s;o, of Con&s;equence, the reading it, that is to &s;ay, the
reading it as a Diver&s;ion, or with Delight, mu&s;t be
the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The Brother argued, That, as the End and U&s;e
of every Fable was in the Moral; &s;o a Fiction, or
what they call'd a Romance, told only with De&s;ign
to deceive the Reader, bring him to believe, that the
Fact related was true, and &s;o to plea&s;e and delight
him with a Fal&s;hood in&s;tead of a Hi&s;tory, mu&s;t be
what &s;he had call'd it, criminal and wicked, and <HI>mak|ing
a Lye;</HI> being done with a De&s;ign to deceive,
and was made &s;till more &s;o, by how much it was
more or le&s;s de&s;ign'd to deceive prejudicially, and to
the Hurt of the Per&s;on, as particularly where it was
calculated to recommend Vice, di&s;courage Virtue,
debauch the Ears and Minds of Youth, rai&s;e
loo&s;e and vain Conceptions of Things in the
Thoughts, and the like.</P>
<P>But on the contrary, where the Moral of the Tale
is duly annex'd, and the End directed right, wherein
it evidently accords; the enforcing &s;ound Truths;
making ju&s;t and &s;olid Impre&s;&s;ions on the Mind; re|commending
great and good Actions, rai&s;ing Senti|ments
of Virtue in the Soul, and filling the Mind
with ju&s;t Re&s;entments again&s;t wicked Actions of all
Kinds: He in&s;i&s;ted then, and in &s;uch Ca&s;es, Fables,
feigned Hi&s;tories, invented Tales, and even &s;uch as
we call <HI>Romances,</HI> have always been allow'd as the
mo&s;t pungent Way of writing or &s;peaking; the mo&s;t
apt to make Impre&s;&s;ions upon the Mind, and open
the Door to the ju&s;t Inferences and Improve|ment
<PB N="53" REF="67">
which was to be made of them. He added,
that for &s;ome Ages, it was the mo&s;t u&s;ual, if not the
only Way of Teaching in the World; the brighte&s;t
Part of Oratory, and was u&s;ed in Ca&s;es of the la&s;t
Moment, as the mo&s;t Per&s;ua&s;ive; that we find it fre|quent
in Scripture, as in the Speech of the wi&s;e
Woman of <HI>Tekoah</HI> to King <HI>David, 2 Sam.</HI> xiv. 4,
5, 6, 7. the like of <HI>Nathan</HI> the Prophet to the &s;ame
King <HI>David,</HI> on Occa&s;ion of the Murther of <HI>Uri$h,</HI>
and the debauching his Wife, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> xii. from the fir&s;t
to the fifth Ver&s;e: and again, the like in the Me&s;&s;age
of <HI>Joa&s;h</HI> King of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> to <HI>Amazia</HI> King of <HI>Judah,</HI>
2. <HI>Chron.</HI> xxv. 18. and &s;everal others. He went on
to the &s;everal Allu&s;ions made u&s;e of by the Prophets,
and that by the Direction of Heaven, as particularly
that of the Prophets <HI>Ezekiel, I&s;aiah, &amp;c.</HI> and
he at la&s;t in&s;tanc'd in the Parables or Hi&s;torical
Relations, left upon Record by our Saviour him&s;elf;
&s;uch as that of <HI>Dives</HI> and <HI>Lazarus,</HI> that of the Prodi|gal
Son, and e&s;pecially of the Sower, who went forth
to &s;ow, and &s;owed his Corn by the Highway Side;
and many others.</P>
<P>The Brother went a great Way farther in that
Part of his Di&s;cour&s;e, but le&s;t they &s;hould &s;eem
too large in his Allowance of Romances in General;
he forget not, however, to make a kind of Provi&s;o
at the End of his Di&s;cour&s;e, again&s;t approving of
&s;uch Fables and Romances as are u&s;ually the Pro|duct
of the pre&s;ent Age, having no &s;uch moral or
ju&s;tifiable End attending them; and to recommend
to his Si&s;ter the bringing her Ta&s;te of Things to
&s;uch a Perfection, that &s;he might be apt to judge
of Truth, and receive due Impre&s;&s;ions of Wi&s;dom
and Knowledge, tho' not dre&s;s'd up with far|fetch'd
Allu&s;ions, Allegories, and invented Stories to
enforce them; and to this Purpo&s;e, he gave her the
ju&s;t Characters of &s;everal fabulous Writings, which
were much in Vogue in the Town, and al&s;o of their
<PB N="54" REF="68">
Writers: From which Di&s;cour&s;e, they de&s;cended to
tho&s;e of Operas, Plays, Tragedies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and they
had &s;everal Di&s;cour&s;es afterwards upon the &s;ame Sub|ject,
which would be very well worth recording; but
being foreign to the pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, I lay them by
for another Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The good Father was exceedingly delighted with
the Di&s;cour&s;e, and e&s;pecially to hear his Son arguing in
&s;o &s;olid and &s;erious a Manner; but he was &s;urprized
with the &s;udden Turn of his Daughter's Wit on that
Occa&s;ion: Whether the young Lady thought her &s;elf
out-done by the &s;olid Arguments her Brother made
u&s;e of; or that &s;he rather yielded to, than differ'd from
his Opinion, but was perhaps loth to let him &s;ee it, I
know not; but &s;he &s;topt the Di&s;cour&s;e; and turning
to her Father, &s;he &s;ays, Sir, you u&s;ed to tell us &s;ome
old Stories about Popery, a hundred Times more to
the Purpo&s;e than this grave Di&s;cour&s;e; Pray, Sir,

Romances, is good, only a little too general; and my

encourage the corrupt U&s;age of the Age, in putting
Romances upon us without their Moral, and affirming
them not to be Romances: and this puts me in Mind
of a Story which may be nece&s;&s;ary for your In&s;truc|tion

upon your own Di&s;cour&s;es, and call'd them

his Que&s;tion to you.</P>

under&s;tand it to be a formal made Story in
Print, rai&s;ed out of the Invention of the Author,
and put upon the World to cheat the Readers, in
the Shape or Appearance of Hi&s;torical Truth; but
if I mu&s;t explain my Si&s;ter's Term (<HI>viz.</HI>) of <HI>roman|tick

<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I meant nothing, but that we were gotten
into a Strain of Di&s;cour&s;e above our Under&s;tanding,
at lea&s;t above mine; and I think, to talk of Things

above our Reach, with a Suppo&s;ition that we were
&s;ufficient to the Di&s;cour&s;e, is to talk <HI>Romantick.</HI></P>

this: I &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e Accounts to be both right in
their Places re&s;pectively, but how came the&s;e fictitious
Stories to be called <HI>Romances?</HI> and tho&s;e Di&s;cour&s;ing$

that; I mu&s;t con&s;ider and inquire a litttle before I
an&s;wer: let my Si&s;ter give an Account of it, perhaps
&s;he knows better than I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is no Matter for inquiring or je&s;ting with
your Si&s;ter; I'll tell you whence it comes.</P>
</SP>
<P>When the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Prie&s;ts, having &s;et up a New
Pageantry of Wor&s;hip in the Chri&s;tian Church, and
which we, for divers good Cau&s;es and Considerations
call <HI>Popery;</HI> they found it very difficult to &s;uppor$
all the gro&s;s Impo&s;itions, which they put upon Man|kind
for want of <HI>Miracles.</HI></P>
<P>Real <HI>Miracle</HI> was out of their Power; the Fal&s;e|hood
of their Faith plac'd all tho&s;e Things beyond
their Reach; but the Cau&s;e mu&s;t be upheld, <HI>fas
aut nefas;</HI> and real Miracle not being to be had,
imaginary Wonder was made u&s;e of to &s;upply:
The&s;e being atte&s;ted by the Prie&s;ts in every Place, and
&s;ome very remote from <HI>Rome;</HI> it was no Wonder,
that they were &s;wallowed greedily by the People in
tho&s;e Days, when, by long Ignorance, their Minds
were prepar'd to be impos'd upon.</P>
<P>The Accounts of the&s;e &s;uppos'd Miracles, &s;wel|ling
in Bulk, and growing too numerous to be re|tain'd
in Memory, were fir&s;t recorded by the Monks,
in their &s;everal Registers; and then brought to
<HI>Rome,</HI> to be regi&s;tered al&s;o in the Books or Records
of the <HI>Vatican.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="71">
The Books where tho&s;e lying Tales were &s;et down,
were called <HI>Legenda,</HI> and afterwards in <HI>Engli&s;h, Le|gends;</HI>
and becau&s;e they were kept, as I &s;aid, at
<HI>Rome,</HI> from whence Copies were tran&s;mitted to all
Parts of the World, they were called <HI>Roman Legends.</HI></P>
<P>The mo&s;t &s;candalous Fal&s;hoods, the mo&s;t ridiculous,
&s;imple, and impo&s;&s;ible Things, being thus put upon
the World by the Prie&s;ts; and the Belief of them im|pos'd,
on Pain of <HI>Anathema</HI> and Excommunication;
the more enlightned World began at length to open
their Eyes; nor was it the lea&s;t Step to the Reforma|tion;
for even, long before <HI>Luther,</HI> the <HI>Lollards,</HI> the
<HI>Wickliffians,</HI> the <HI>Hu&s;&s;ites,</HI> and others, who fir&s;t &s;aw
thro' tho&s;e Fables, began to expo&s;e them to the
World; thus gradually they grew into Contempt,
till at length, they became a Thing of mere Scorn;
a <HI>Roman Legend</HI> was &s;oon taken, in general, to
be a Collection of Lyes; and by Con&s;equence, any
other fal&s;e Stories put together to abu&s;e the World,
were &s;oon after e&s;teemed a <HI>Roman Legend.</HI> Hence,
the learned Part of the World, abridging the Speech
with more Propriety, call'd &s;peaking fal&s;ly, <HI>Roman|cing,</HI>
and a bold Way of advancing Fal&s;hood by
mere dint of Face, was from thence called <HI>Roman|tick;</HI>
if it was in Writing, it was called a <HI>Romantick
Style;</HI> if in Speech, a <HI>Romantick</HI> Di&s;cour&s;e, and the
like.</P>
<P>Hence, I derive the Word Romance, (<HI>viz.</HI>) from
the Practice of the <HI>Romani&s;ts,</HI> in impo&s;ing Lyes and
Fables upon the World; and I believe, without inju|ring
any one, I may venture to &s;ay, that Popery is a
<HI>Romantick Religion,</HI> and, if Opportunity offers, I
may convince you all of it, in a little Time.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;aid, my Father would find &s;omething
upon the Subject that would both in&s;truct us and
make us merry too; I never heard any Thing more
to the Purpo&s;e in my Life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="58" REF="72">
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Thing is very probable, for I have
heard, indeed, that tho&s;e Legends are a Bulk of
&s;trange and mo&s;t ridiculous Things, brought to|gether
by the Prie&s;ts, and collected from all the
Corners of the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and the farther off the better, becau&s;e
as the People are bound to believe them, &s;o, if
they would di&s;pute them, they have no Oppor|tunity
to unravel the Fraud; 'tis plac'd at &s;o re|mote
a Di&s;tance there is no &s;earching into it: Such
as the miraculous Tomb of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> in the
Kingdom of <HI>Golconda</HI> in the <HI>Indies;</HI> the Miracle
of St. <HI>Hilarion</HI> riding over the <HI>Nile</HI> upon a <HI>Cro|codile,</HI>
and many &s;uch like.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope, Sir, you will give us &s;ome particular
Stories of this Kind, at your Lei&s;ure; that we may
&s;ee a little farther into the Knavery of the Prie&s;ts,
&s;ince they are &s;o bu&s;y with us to bring us over: I wi&s;h
my Brother had heard this Story in particular.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hall give you Evidence enough of the Impu|dence
of their Legends, if that will be any Help to
you: But fir&s;t let me lay the Foundation, and tell
you how, and by what Degrees, this <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Anti|chri&s;t
&s;et her &s;elf up in Chri&s;t's Throne, and u&s;urp'd
his Authority.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wi&s;h you would, Sir; for nothing can be &s;o
&s;ure a Foundation for us to go upon, as to know the
true Hi&s;tory of Popery, and where &s;he began.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>She began indeed right; her Foundation is
built upon the Ruin of the true Chri&s;tian Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is the more likely to be Idolatrous her|&s;elf;
for the Corruption of the be&s;t Things is the
wor&s;t: Naturali&s;ts tell us, that nothing is more con|tagious
than the Plague upon a human Body, which
in it&s;elf is the mo&s;t beautiful of all God's Creatures.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know the Thing is tedious in it&s;elf,
but my Father can &s;um up the Hi&s;tory of it in a few
Words, if he plea&s;es.</P>
</SP>
<PB N="59" REF="73">
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>A few Words will not indeed de&s;cribe it; the
Hi&s;tory of a Thou&s;and Years is not ea&s;ily abridg'd,
or brought into the Compa&s;s of a Story of Ten Mi|nutes,
and now would be too long for your hearing;
but you may take it piece-meal, and I'll give it you
&s;ome and &s;ome, as I can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Brother, Sir, in&s;i&s;ts much upon it, that
the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> was at fir&s;t the true Chri&s;tian
Church, and the only true Church, and that we ac|knowledge
it to be &s;o; that it was the &s;ame that &s;uf|fer'd
all tho&s;e Severities under the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors,
which we call the Ten Per&s;ecutions, and that they
only were the true Primitive Chri&s;tians.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, he adds, that all the glorious Martyrs,
who we call the Fathers, &s;uch as St. <HI>Polycarpe,</HI> St.
<HI>Ignatius,</HI> St. <HI>Athana&s;ius,</HI> St. <HI>Cyprian,</HI> and an innu|merable
Company of Martyrs, were Members of
the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, and that &s;everal of their <HI>Popes</HI>
were Martyrs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, Son, you run too fa&s;t; you &s;hould &s;ay
Bi&s;hops of <HI>Rome,</HI> not <HI>Popes,</HI> for they were not come
to be <HI>Popes,</HI> in the Sen&s;e we now under&s;tand the
Word, for &s;everal hundred Years after the Ten Per|&s;ecutions
were over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Brother call'd them <HI>Popes,</HI> Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and &s;o all the Bi&s;hops of other Churches
were call'd <HI>Popes,</HI> till after a long Series of Trea|&s;on,
Con&s;piracy, and even War and Blood, the
Bi&s;hop of <HI>Rome</HI> a&s;&s;um'd Temporal Power, and at
la&s;t the Primacy; of which I told you the Story,
when your Brother was here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wi&s;h, Sir, you would tell us that Story over
again; it confounded our new Convert &s;o, that he
had not a Word to &s;ay; and I am per&s;uaded, it would
make any Body that was to hear it, &s;ick of Popery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why it &s;eems you remember it, Child; there's
no need to repeat it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="60" REF="74">
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, but I ha'n't all the Particulars, I would
be &s;o Mi&s;tre&s;s of the whole Story, as to be able to
tell it again in Company; for &s;ometimes we meet
with a Papi&s;t or two, and they are generally pretty
talkative, e&s;pecially the Ladies; and it would be a
rare Story to tell them, when they are in their
Altitudes, crying up the <HI>Pope,</HI> and his infallible
Authority.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you &s;hould have more of the Story,
Child, than I had Time to tell to your Brother. I
a&s;&s;ure you it is worth your hearing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, you &s;aid that the Bi&s;hops of other
Churches were call'd <HI>Popes</HI> too; I do not remember
that ever I heard that before: I thought there had
never been any <HI>Popes</HI> but the <HI>Pope</HI> of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, nor I neither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, the Word Pope was originally no
more than <HI>Papa,</HI> or Father, and to this Day, in fo|reign
Countries, all the Prie&s;ts are called <HI>Padres,</HI> that
is to &s;ay, Fathers; and as we in <HI>England</HI> call our
Bi&s;hops Right Reverend Fathers, and the Arch|bi&s;hops
the Mo&s;t Reverend Fathers, &s;o in tho&s;e Days
the Chri&s;tian Bi&s;hops were call'd Fathers, that is
Papa's, or Popes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I &s;uppo&s;e they did not u&s;e the very
&s;ame Word Pope.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes they did, the very &s;ame Word, as may
be &s;een in Hi&s;tory. <HI>Cornelius,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Rome,</HI> in
his Writings to his Brethren the Bi&s;hops of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI>
&s;peaking of St. <HI>Cyprian,</HI> calls him <HI>Pope</HI> of <HI>Carthage;
Diony&s;ius,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> Succe&s;&s;or of <HI>Atha|na&s;ius,</HI>
calls his Predece&s;&s;or <HI>Heraclias,</HI> the Ble&s;&s;ed
<HI>Pope Heraclias;</HI> and <HI>Sidonius,</HI> a famous Chri&s;tian
Father, in all his Epi&s;tles to <HI>Hilary,</HI> and other his
Contemporaries, calls all the Bi&s;hops of <HI>France, Popes;</HI>
and the Emperor <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> writing to St. <HI>Athana&s;ius,</HI>
calls him, <HI>Your Holine&s;s:</HI> So that the Stile is not at
all a Peculiar to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Rome;</HI> the Bi&s;hop of
<PB N="61" REF="75">
<HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and of <HI>Antioch,</HI> and of &s;everal other
Capital Cities, were call'd <HI>Popes,</HI> as far back as to
<HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> him&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is more indeed than I had con&s;ider'd
before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, it &s;eems we call our Bi&s;hops <HI>Popes</HI> here
in <HI>England;</HI> I never minded that before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>They would be very angry if you &s;hould call
them &s;o, for all that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if you plea&s;e, Sir, let us go back a little
to tho&s;e Times, and let us hear how long the
Church of <HI>Rome</HI> continu'd Christian; it &s;eems &s;he
was the Primitive and Only Chri&s;tian true Church
at fir&s;t; that, you &s;ay, we mu&s;t grant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis granted; and they boa&s;t much of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know they do; my Brother made a great
Blu&s;ter about it; and, in particular, that the Pro|te&s;tants
acknowledg'd it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>They have very little to boa&s;t of upon that
Account; let 'em look into the <HI>Lam.</HI> v. 16. The
<HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Church was God's pure Church many Hun|dred
Years: But what &s;ays the Prophet; <HI>The Crown
is fallen from Our Heads;</HI> WOE <HI>unto us that We have
&s;inned!</HI> They were once a flouri&s;hing Church, <HI>that
is true;</HI> but the Crown is fallen from their Heads:
The Rea&s;on is plain; they fell from their Primitive
Purity, which was their Glory, and being gradually
&s;ubjected to the Tyranny of the Clergy; they (the
Clergy) drew them from that Purity of Doctrine, to
all tho&s;e gro&s;s Ab&s;urdities and Errors, till they re|duc'd
their Primitive Purity of Principles into one
great Ma&s;s, or Bulk of Idolatry and Super&s;tition,
&s;uch as we find it to be at this Time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>But this was not all at once.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, Child; as the Church was &s;everal
Hundred Years growing under the Tyranny of the
<HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, &s;o it was &s;ome Ages flouri&s;hing
in Liberty and Pro&s;perity, under the Dominion and
<PB N="62" REF="76">
Protection of Chri&s;tian Emperors; and it was from
thence &s;everal Hundred Years in its declining State;
till it might be &s;aid to be arriv'd to the Full Per|fection
of its Decay, and to be the mere <HI>Seat of the
Bea&s;t,</HI> as de&s;crib'd in the Scripture, and as we &s;ee it
this Day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Sir, when do you reckon the Primi|tive
Church to be in its Heighth of Purity and Pro&s;pe|rity?
For certainly it was once in a mo&s;t glorious State.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, that is a difficult Thing to point out to
you; for no &s;ooner did the Church get Liberty and
Ea&s;e, and the Enemies of Religion cea&s;e to per&s;e|cute,
but Pride and Strife broke in upon its Peace
by the haughty Behaviour of the Clergy: Pro&s;perity
puff'd them up: The Emperor <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> in his
abundant Zeal for Religion, gave the Prie&s;ts &s;uch an
exce&s;&s;ive Sway in the Empire, that they knew not
how to moderate them&s;elves: In &s;hort, he forgot
that, tho' the Bi&s;hops were Chri&s;tians, and good
Chri&s;tians too, yet that they were Men al&s;o, and
&s;ubject to like Pa&s;&s;ions as other Men; and, in a
Word, he gave them &s;uch a Head, and &s;uch a Loo&s;e
to their Pride (as Prie&s;ts) and &s;et them up &s;o high,
that all the Kings of the Earth have not been able to
bring them down again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was an ill U&s;e made of the good Inten|tions
of a pious Prince; for in all the Hi&s;tories that
I have read of <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Great, they repre&s;ent
him as a wonderful Prince for his Zeal, and &s;incere Af|fection
to the Chri&s;tian Religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and they do him but Right, for it was his
Due: But I &s;ay too, it was the weake&s;t Part of
that Prince. He ador'd the Clergy; he &s;et them up
as little Idols in the Government of the Church;
who the People were not only to obey, but to re|verence,
and almo&s;t to wor&s;hip; and, at the &s;ame
Time, he forgot that they were Men, till they put
him in Mind of it by their Folly and Pride; for they
<PB N="63" REF="77">
were continually falling out and wrangling with one
another, and that chiefly for Superiority, and the
highe&s;t Places in the Synagogue; and this not only
perplex'd the Emperor, and was very grievous to
him, in the latter End of his Days, but it rai&s;ed
Sects and Divi&s;ions in the Church, and Factions, and
even Tumults in the State.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was very early to begin in that Manner,
when they were but ju&s;t got, as it were, out of the
Fire of Per&s;ecution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was &s;o; but that was not all: For it not
only brought in Divi&s;ions and Factions, but with
tho&s;e came in Errors and Here&s;ies of divers Sorts;
&s;uch as were afterwards fatal to the Church's Peace,
and &s;candalous to the very Name of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, the Church had but a very &s;hort
Space of Pro&s;perity; for <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> him&s;elf, I think,
did not reign above Two and thirty Years, and a
long Reign too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis true, her Pro&s;perity was &s;hort, if you
reckon only the Time when her Tranquillity was un|di&s;turb'd,
and her Profe&s;&s;ion uncorrupted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think &s;he could not be &s;aid to be in a State
of Pro&s;perity, when &s;he enjoy'd neither Purity in
Doctrine, or Peace in Government.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis very true; and that was indeed her Ca&s;e,
in the breaking out of the <HI>Arian</HI> Here&s;y, which
&s;hew'd it&s;elf even in the Reign of <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> him&s;elf,
the fir&s;t Chri&s;tian Emperor; and grew to &s;uch a
Heighth, and with &s;uch a &s;wift and &s;peedy Advance,
that the next Emperor, <HI>Con&s;tantius,</HI> was a profe&s;s'd
<HI>Arian,</HI> and an Encourager of all tho&s;e that had
di&s;turb'd the Church before; the Con&s;equence of
which was, that the Orthodox Profe&s;&s;ors were depo|&s;ed,
and Per&s;ecution broke out again in a lamentable
Manner: For the Chri&s;tians per&s;ecuted one another
alternatively; the <HI>Arians</HI> the Orthodox, and the
Orthodox the <HI>Arians,</HI> as Power came into their
<PB N="64" REF="78">
Hands, with almo&s;t as much Vehemence and Cruelty,
as the Heathens had before u&s;ed them all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a Confirmation of what I have often
ob&s;erv'd, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That Liberty has not always been
an Advantage to the Chri&s;tian Religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>So far from it, that, on the contrary, it &s;eems
as if God had thought fit to cau&s;e the Afflictions of
his Church to be the be&s;t Means of its E&s;tabli&s;hment;
but that's a Speculation too tedious for our brief Way
of Talking, and would require a Recapitulation of
the Hi&s;tory of the Church in all Ages, as well the
<HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> as the Chri&s;tian; for even from the Begin|ning
of an e&s;tabli&s;h'd Wor&s;hip, the Profe&s;&s;ors always
fell back from their Profe&s;&s;ion in the Times of Liber|ty
and Toleration; and return'd to humble them|&s;elves,
when under the Oppre&s;&s;ion of their Enemies,
in Captivity, and the like.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;ign'd for it? We
know it is &s;o, and even to this Day 'tis evident
among the reform'd Churches thro' all <HI>Europe;</HI> but
'tis very &s;trange that it &s;hould be &s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's likewi&s;e too long, and too melancholy
a Subject for our Way of Talking; it would be an
excellent Di&s;cour&s;e for a Fa&s;t-Day Sermon; for 'tis a
&s;uitable Subject of Humiliation to us, and all Pro|te&s;tants:
But your Father is no Mini&s;ter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think my Father is a very good Mini&s;ter
to us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>While you think &s;o, Child, I may hope for
the more Succe&s;s; but I de&s;ire to keep within the
Bounds of my Place: I may in&s;truct as a Father,
tho' not preach as a Mini&s;ter, and &s;o far I am a Mi|ni&s;ter
in my Place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>But pray, Sir, go on with the State of the
Church, where you left off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why the Di&s;turbance that <HI>Arius</HI> gave the
Church did not la&s;t long; <HI>Con&s;tantius</HI>'s Reign was
&s;hort; and <HI>Julian</HI> the Apo&s;tate, threatning the whole
<PB N="65" REF="79">
Fabrick of the Church with a Di&s;&s;olution, and the
Re&s;toration of Pagani&s;m, the Chri&s;tians began to be
a little better united; and his Reign being &s;hort, the
Orthodox Part recover'd; and tho' the Errors of
<HI>Arius</HI> continu'd, yet the Government was Orthodox,
and &s;o the Church might be &s;aid to enjoy Peace and
Liberty for a long Time.</P>
</SP>
<P>But in this Time of Liberty, the Brigues and In|trigues
of the Clergy ruin'd all another Way; for
they were continually quarrelling for Trifles, &s;uch as
the Ob&s;ervation of <HI>Ea&s;ter,</HI> the Manner of receiving
Penitents, and the like; but above all, the great
Affair of the Primacy, and who &s;hould be upper|mo&s;t;
and this agitated the Church till the Year
590, and &s;o I am come down to the Story of Pope
<HI>Gregory</HI> and the Emperor <HI>Phocas,</HI> where I left off with
your Brother.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, that's the Story that I want to hear over
again.</P>

<P>Why 'tis a Story worth hearing, e&s;pecially
for young Popi&s;h Converts, or &s;uch as are in Dan|ger
of being perverted by the Craft of the Prie&s;ts.</P>
</SP>
<P><HI>Gregory</HI> the Great was Bi&s;hop of <HI>Rome,</HI> at the
&s;ame Time that <HI>Mauritius</HI> was Emperor of <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople;</HI>
it's plain that a Conte&s;t had been car|ried
on for &s;everal Years between the Bi&s;hops of
<HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> for the Title of <HI>Univer&s;al</HI>
Bi&s;hop: But that <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> being the Capital of
the Empire, and where the Emperor kept his Re|&s;idence,
the Bi&s;hop of that City had a great Ad|vantage,
and, by rhe Favour of the Court, main|tain'd
his Primacy with Ea&s;e; &s;o that the Bi&s;hops
of <HI>Rome</HI> could not come in for &s;everal Years.</P>
<P><HI>Gregory,</HI> tho' willing enough to have been the
Head of the Church, yet finding it out of his
Reach, play'd a new Game; for, like the Fox,
becau&s;e he could not come at the Grapes, he de&s;pis'd
<PB N="66" REF="80">
'em, and &s;aid they were &s;our and unwhol&s;ome; &s;o he
not being able to obtain the Title of Univer&s;al Bi&s;hop
for him&s;elf, anathematiz'd all tho&s;e that pretended to
it; declaring it to be a mo&s;t impious Thing, unbe|coming
a Chri&s;tian Bi&s;hop, a Scandal to the Name
and Profe&s;&s;ion of the Chri&s;tian Religion, and the
like; and this he pu&s;h'd on to &s;uch a Height, that
there are &s;everal publick Acts of his now ex|tant,
which are full of the warme&s;t Expre&s;&s;ions of
Zeal again&s;t tho&s;e that &s;ought this Superiority; &s;ome
of which I'll give you in Writing, that you may be
&s;ure to remember them on all Occa&s;ions; for this
<HI>Gregory</HI> was a famous Man in the Church, and was
for many Rea&s;ons &s;til'd the <HI>Great.</HI></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is not that he, who, they &s;ay, was the la&s;t of
the good Bi&s;hops, and the fir&s;t of the bad ones?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, the &s;ame; only, that 'tis a little differing|ly
expre&s;t, for they &s;aid rather, that he was the wor&s;t
of the Good Bi&s;hops, and far from being the be&s;t
of the Bad ones: But you &s;hall have his Character
be&s;t laid before you, in the Hi&s;tory of his Conduct
in this particular Affair: The Story is pretty long,
but 'tis fit you &s;hould hear it.</P>
</SP>
<P><HI>John</HI> IV. was Bi&s;hop of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and he
being Bi&s;hop of the Imperial City, and having a par|ticular
Intere&s;t in, and Influence upon the Emperor,
began the Emulation, by in&s;i&s;ting, That the Imperi|al
City, as it had the chief Civil Magi&s;trate on Earth,
&s;o it ought to have the chief Spiritual Officer, re&s;i|ding
in it, for the Good, and for the Service of the
Church. Upon this In&s;inuation, to which he obtain|ed
the Emperor's A&s;&s;ent, he a&s;&s;umed the Title of
OECUMENICAL, that is to &s;ay, UNIVERSAL BISHOP.</P>
<P><HI>Gregory,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Rome,</HI> oppo&s;ed this U&s;urpation,
as he call'd it, with all his Might; but that Em|peror
openly taking <HI>John</HI> IV's. Party, and as 'tis
&s;ugge&s;ted, having a private Re&s;olution to humble
<PB N="67" REF="81">
<HI>Gregory</HI> upon &s;ome former Mi&s;under&s;tanding be|tween
them; <HI>Gregory</HI> &s;oon found it was in vain for
him to &s;truggle with <HI>John,</HI> in Behalf of his own See
of <HI>Rome,</HI> for the Emperor had &s;ent him a peremp|tory
Command, to &s;ubmit to POPE <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Con|&s;tantinople,</HI>
and give him the Title of <HI>OEcumenical:</HI>
I &s;ay, finding him&s;elf thus over-match'd, and that he
could not expect the Honour of being call'd Univer|&s;al,
he falls upon the Title it&s;elf, and condemns it as an
U&s;urpation; affirming, that no Chri&s;tian Bi&s;hop
ought to pre&s;ume to take &s;uch a Title upon him.</P>
<P>This is to be &s;een in &s;everal of <HI>Gregory</HI>'s Epi&s;tles,

<P>As to that, there is a great deal to be &s;aid of

let us &s;ee of what Kind it is.</P>
</SP>
<P><PB N="68" REF="82">
He was the Father of Super&s;tition, and that in
&s;uch a notorious Degree, that he is &s;aid to be the

of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church, and the Introducer of

<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The whole Office, or Eccle&s;ia&s;tical <HI>Formula,</HI>
which is now called the MASS, was of his

<ITEM>4. He &s;et up the <HI>Dedication</HI> of <HI>Churches,</HI> to the
Names and Memory of departed Saints and to

<ITEM>5. He was the mo&s;t zealous Monk-maker that

Bi&s;hop,</HI> it is true, he did not live to receive
the <HI>Diploma</HI> from the Emperor <HI>Phocas;</HI> but there is
a mo&s;t vi&s;ible Te&s;timony, how much he was of a
Turn-coat, and a Time-&s;erver in his particular Con|duct

<HI>Maurice</HI> and <HI>Phocas.</HI></P>
<P>While the Emperor <HI>Maurice</HI> or <HI>Mauritius</HI> was in

Who can think this was written by a Pope, while the

<P>A little while after this, <HI>Phocas,</HI> of whom I have

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mu&s;t take the Character of the Man, and
of the Times, and put them together: He was a
mighty good Man, as Goodne&s;s went in tho&s;e Days;
and, particularly, he was a mighty Stickler for Ce|remony
and Super&s;tition: In &s;hort, he laid the Foun|dation
on which almo&s;t all the Errors and Delu&s;ions
of Popery have been built.</P>

<P>I have enough of him; I think Popery ne|ver

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, <HI>Boniface</HI> III. fini&s;hed the Con&s;pi|racy;
for he being cho&s;en Pope while he was at
<HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> &s;o far in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the Ty|rant

<PB N="71" REF="85">

have kept the Title ever &s;ince, notwith&s;tand|ing
all the Declarations which <HI>Gregory</HI> made again&s;t
it: And thus you are come to the fir&s;t U&s;urpations
of Popery. It is a long and a di&s;mal Story, if con|&s;ider'd
in the fatal Con&s;equences of it: But at fir&s;t,

<P>But, pray Sir, where lay the <HI>Snake in the

of this Title of <HI>Univer&s;al?</HI> And what was it
to the World who enjoy'd it, whether the Bi&s;hop of
<HI>Rome</HI> or of <HI>Con&s;tantinople?</HI> I don't &s;ee much in it.</P>

<P>O! you are mi&s;taken, Child; as they boa&s;t
that Chri&s;t &s;aid to <HI>Peter,</HI> Upon <HI>this Rock</HI> will I
build my Church, meaning <HI>Peter</HI> per&s;onally; &s;o up|on
this Rock of Offence, all manner of Error, all
the abominable Cheats and horrid Idolatries of the
Papi&s;ts, have been introduced into the <HI>Roman</HI> Church
to this Day: Such as,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The <HI>Bi&s;hop of Rome</HI> being declared <HI>Univer&s;al,</HI>
became thereby &s;uperior to all the Bi&s;hops;
and the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> to all the Churches in
the World; and this brought the Eccle&s;ia&s;tick
Legi&s;lature nece&s;&s;arily into their Hands.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>Hence,</HI> all the other Bi&s;hop Succe&s;&s;ors to <HI>Bo|niface</HI>
III. a&s;&s;um'd the Right of Introducing
Rites and Modes of Wor&s;hip into the Church,
and Impo&s;ing tho&s;e Modes of Wor&s;hip upon
the People; thence began Innovations, and
teaching, for Doctrine, the Commandments of
Men.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>Hence</HI> they brought in the great Cheat of In|fallibility;
and that made them ab&s;olute Ty|rants
over the Con&s;ciences of the People: For,
if the <HI>Pope</HI> was Head, or <HI>Univer&s;al,</HI>
and al&s;o
<PB N="72" REF="86">
<HI>Infallible,</HI> it was natural that all Men ought to
&s;ubmit to him, upon Pain of Eternal Dam|nation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Upon this Doctrine of Submi&s;&s;ion to the Pope,
the whole Chri&s;tian World became Slaves to the
<HI>Roman Pontiff;</HI> and they (the Bi&s;hops of <HI>Rome</HI>)
rul'd it, indeed, with a Curb-Bridle: For,
they planted Churches, e&s;tabli&s;h'd Bi&s;hops, call'd
Councils, and di&s;&s;olv'd them at Plea&s;ure; and,
in a Word, they truly, and literally, trod upon
the Necks of Princes; Depo&s;ing, Anathemati|zing,
and even Murthering them, at Plea&s;ure;
of which our own Hi&s;tories, and the Hi&s;tories
of Neighbouring Nations, are full of terrible
Examples.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;ee a little farther into it, indeed, than I
did before; 'Tis plain, that &s;etting up as Heads,
would give them a Liberty of Tyrannizing at Plea|&s;ure;
and I &s;hall never doubt but that when the
Churchmen have Power in their Hands, they al|ways
find means to make the mo&s;t of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>From this Time Monkery was farther encou|rag'd;
it was &s;et on foot in the Church but a little
before: And, what a Ne&s;t of Villainy was built up|on
it afterwards, for the propagating of Enthu&s;ia&s;m,
and the mo&s;t horrid Delu&s;ions, I &s;hall take an Occa|&s;ion
to bring to your Remembrance as we go on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not think, Sir, we &s;hould trouble you
to look back thro' all the Particulars of a Popi&s;h
Legend of Lyes; and that you &s;hould be bound to
give us the Detail of all the Attacks which tho&s;e
Wretches have made upon the Minds of the igno|rant
People: The General Hi&s;tory of the&s;e things
will lead us to inquire into the Particulars. That I
mo&s;t wonder at, is, that &s;uch a Man as St. <HI>Gregory</HI>
&s;hould be drawn into &s;uch a Snare, as that of Setting
up the Idol of the Ma&s;s and other Trumpery; for
<PB N="73" REF="87">
he &s;eems to be the Father of Super&s;tition in the <HI>Ro|man</HI>
Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis not to be wonder'd at at all, if you con|&s;ider
the great Advantages which Churchmen made
on tho&s;e Occa&s;ions, to exalt their Power, encrea&s;e
their Gains, and give them an Influence in the
Councils of all the Courts in the World.</P>
</SP>
<P>This was not to be re&s;i&s;ted by the Clergy, however
they might pretend to Sanctity and Self-denial: By
<HI>Gregory</HI>'s Example, almo&s;t every Pope, added &s;ome|thing
New to the Lump and Formality of the Chri|&s;tian
Wor&s;hip. SABINIANUS, the worthle&s;s Succe&s;|&s;or
for of <HI>Gregory the Great,</HI> began immediately, and
brought in the U&s;e of Canonical Hours, which he
in&s;tituted in Di&s;tinction from other Times, accord|ing
to the Cu&s;tom among the <HI>Jews,</HI> of <HI>the Hour of
Prayer:</HI> He al&s;o ordained, that Tapers &s;hould be
kept continually burning upon the Altar; and yet
this Creature, of whom <HI>Plautina</HI> &s;ays, he merited
not to be remembered, held the Pontificate but
Seventeen Months and Nine Days: Had he liv'd
longer, he would have done all the Work him&s;elf.</P>
<P>His next Succe&s;&s;or, <HI>Boniface</HI> III. held it but Eight
Months and &s;ome odd Days; and yet, he e&s;tabli&s;hed
the Title of <HI>Univer&s;al Bi&s;hop</HI> upon the Chair of St.
<HI>Peter,</HI> by the Favour of the Tyrant and Murtherer
<HI>Phocas,</HI> as I have told you; and which they retain
to this Day: Thus every <HI>Pope,</HI> from this Time for|ward,
impo&s;ed &s;ome Innovation or other upon the
Church, to exalt the outward Pomp and Power of
their Wor&s;hip; till at length, it came up to the
Prodigy of Bla&s;phemy and Idolatry, which we now
call <HI>Popery.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Boniface</HI> V. ordained the Church to be a Sanctu|ary;
and that even Criminals, of the wor&s;t Kind,
&s;uch as for Murther, or Trea&s;on, or any Thing but
Sacrilege, if they fled to the Church, &s;hould not
be taken from thence by Force; an Immunity which
<PB N="74" REF="88">
the <HI>Roman</HI> Church never parted with to this Day.
It was in his Time that <HI>Mahomet</HI> began to broach
his Impo&s;ture in the World; &s;o that, in &s;hort, Po|pery
and Mahometi&s;m, are not much differing in
their Age, being almo&s;t contemporary; only that Po|pery
is the elder Error.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>What could they propo&s;e, Sir, to them&s;elves
by tho&s;e Innovations? There was nothing of Religion
in them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>The End they aimed at, is veiy plain; fir&s;t it
tended to place a particular Dignity upon the Per&s;ons
of the Prie&s;ts, to give a Superiority to them in all
Things; that &s;o the Church might be exalted up to
Heaven, that the Mitre might be &s;et above the
Crown, and the Popes, reign over all the Kings of
the Earth: In a Word, they aimed at Power; and
to give Sanction to their Authority, equal to what
the <HI>High Prie&s;t</HI> had in the old Levitical Institution,
who turned the King out of the Temple. (2.) And
in Order to this, it was needful to rea&s;&s;ume as much
of the &s;plendid Part of Religion as po&s;&s;ible, that the
Pomp and Ceremony might command the Reverence
of the People.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>But they could not bring it to pa&s;s, I &s;up|po&s;e,
Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are greatly mi&s;taken in that too, for they
did bring it to pa&s;s: Did they not obtain their End,
when, <HI>as you may &s;ee in Hi&s;tory,</HI> Kings laid their
Crowns at their Feet? and the Popes brought
Princes and Kings, nay, Emperors, to ki&s;s their
Toes, to kneel at their Foot-&s;tools, to receive their
Crowns at their Hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, indeed, they did &s;o afterwards.</P>

<P>They could never have been brought to tho&s;e

Rea&s;on, mu&s;t blu&s;h to hear them. So that, indeed,
we want nothing but to &s;et out Popery in its
proper Dre&s;s, give the World a Sight of it

them; I warrant you, we will conquer them by one
Way or other.</P>
<P>This &s;hort Di&s;cour&s;e was among them&s;elves, while
the Gentleman was receiving their Brother, and be|fore
he was come into the Room; but as he, and the
Gentleman that came with him, came forward to
pay their Civilities, they were obliged to break it off,
and fall into other Di&s;cour&s;es.</P>
<P>After &s;ome Time, and, I think, a Dinner between,
the young Gentleman begins with his Si&s;ter in je&s;t:
Well, Si&s;ter, &s;ays he, I hope you will allow me
to come and take my Leave of you, before I go to

<P>Why, Brother, what if it had been a

<SP>

<P>Your Brother is a little pa&s;&s;ionate, Madam;
let me prevail with you to abate your Warmth a
little too: he complains of &s;ome hard U&s;age in the

Account.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad he has a Gentleman of &s;o much

he has had no hard U&s;age among us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it is grating to him, to have the <HI>Catho|lick

calling it a bloody and per&s;ecuting Religion.</P>

<P>But, Madam, as I hinted too, if you look
into other Hi&s;tories, you will find, that the Primi|tive
Chri&s;tians &s;uffered Per&s;ecution from the Pagan
Government, with that glorious Con&s;tancy, as is,
to this Day, the Subject of Prai&s;es to God from all
the Catholick Church; who give Thanks for the
whole Army of Saints and Martyrs, who &s;acrificed
their Lives for the Catholick Faith.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, I have heard of that too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Well, Madam, and was not that the &s;ame
Catholick Church, which &s;till retains the glorious

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was the true Primitive Chri&s;tian Church,
Sir, planted by Chri&s;t him&s;elf and his Apo&s;tles, I

</SP>
<SP>

<P>Yes, Sir, they may be their Succe&s;&s;ors in &s;e|veral

<P>It would engage you and I into a long
Di&s;cour&s;e, if we &s;hould enquire how far this Power
of Ab&s;olution extends; and how it is given to
the Church; and I mould prove ea&s;ily that &s;o much
of it as was practis'd in the Primitive Church, was
practis'd in quite a different Manner from what the
<HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> now u&s;e it in; and that even in that Ca&s;e the

the pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, &s;uppo&s;e it were &s;o, (tho' I do
not grant it) does it follow that the Church has
Power to &s;ell tho&s;e Pardons for Money; to &s;et a

<P>No, Brother, we do not mi&s;repre&s;ent

you plea&s;e, but it is not to be contradicted: I can
prove it, not only from the Practice of your Popi&s;h

<P>Why when you are charg'd with the&s;e Ab|&s;urdities,
&s;uch as Pardons and Di&s;pen&s;ations, if you
are arguing with Men of tolerable Capacities, then
you deny the Fact, and will not own that the
Church gives out any Pardons or Indulgences or
Di&s;pen&s;ations at all: But if you talk with ignorant
and weak People, then you ju&s;tify them, and in&s;i&s;t
upon it, that &s;uch Things are lawful and u&s;eful in
the Church; that they ought to be, and a due Re|gard
ought to be paid to them. So you play Leger|demain
with the World, as be&s;t &s;erves your Oc|ca&s;ion.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>What will you prove? That the Church

the Power; I nam'd you the Commi&s;&s;ion given to
<HI>Peter.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's going from the Point, Brother;
did Chri&s;t give St. <HI>Peter</HI> Authority to &s;ell Pardons
and Di&s;pen&s;ations for Money, and in the &s;candalous
Manner we &s;peak of? And was it given like an Inhe|ritance

<P>Fir&s;t it mu&s;t be determin'd, had he Power

Power al&s;o to depute that Authority to his Suc|ce&s;&s;ors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not grant that neither; but to wave
it for the pre&s;ent: Did Chri&s;t give <HI>Peter</HI> Power to
grant me Leave to &s;in for Twenty or Thirty Years
together, and to pardon all tho&s;e Sins before-hand,
before they were committed? Had <HI>Peter</HI> this Power?
If he had, pray, when was it given him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is the very Thing his little Si&s;ter <HI>Tab.</HI>
put to him; only the Child could not put it into
&s;uch good Order and Words as you do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Si&s;ter, I think &s;he did that too; I
am &s;ure &s;he &s;poke it &s;o naturally, and in &s;uch pretty
innocent Expre&s;&s;ions, that we were all very well
plea&s;ed with her, and I am only telling her Tale

<P>You won't call that an&s;wering it, I &s;up|po&s;e,

</SP>
<SP>

<P>It is enough, Chri&s;t gave St. <HI>Peter</HI> the Power
to <HI>bind</HI> and <HI>loo&s;e,</HI> as you &s;ee in the Text; the Church
is the Interpreter of Scripture, and can alone tell
how far that Power extends; nay, the Church can
extend it as the infallible Spirit directs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is indeed Popery, in the Ab&s;tract:
You &s;ay, the Church has this Power, but you do
<PB N="93" REF="107">
not prove it; we deny it; and it lies upon you to
prove the Affirmative.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>We know it, and that's enough to us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>But we that are Prote&s;tants cannot take
Truths of that Con&s;equence upon &s;uch &s;orry Evi|dence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Evidence would you have?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Scripture: You bring Scripture to
prove that Peter had the Power to <HI>bind</HI> and <HI>loo&s;e.</HI> If
Chri&s;t had given this Power, &s;o extended, to <HI>Peter,</HI>
and whoever he &s;hould depute it to, 'tis rea&s;onable
to believe the &s;ame Scripture would have &s;aid &s;o:
But the Scripture neither gives the Power in &s;uch a

<P>Yes, only with this Difference, that your

<HI>&s;hall pa&s;s away, but my</HI> WORD &s;hall not pa&s;s away?
Luke xxi. 33. And this, I think, is the grand Di|&s;tinction
between a <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> and a <HI>Papi&s;t;</HI> namely,
the one builds his Faith on the infallible eternal
Word of GOD; and the other re&s;ts upon the San|ction
of the Church; that is to &s;ay, a Body of
mortal, fallible Men, &s;ubject to Error, and often fall|ing
into Error; differing from the great Pattern of
Truth, the ble&s;&s;ed Saviour of the World; and dif|fering
<PB N="94" REF="108">
frequently from one another, to a mo&s;t &s;can|dalous
Heighth. Let this be the Difference between
us for ever, till it &s;hall plea&s;e God to enlighten the
World, by his ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, in a more clear and
effectual Manner, &s;o as to bring all Men to the &s;aving
Knowledge of the Truth, and that this Knowledge
may <HI>fill the Earth, as the Watters cover the Sea.</HI></P>
<P>Their Di&s;cour&s;e broke off here, for the pre&s;ent,
and they parted tolerably civil; tho' the Brother
&s;eem'd to be warm to the la&s;t, and to re&s;ent his ill
Treatment, as he call'd it, in the Family; and that
he was unkindly u&s;ed by his Father: Upon which,
they had, afterwards, a Di&s;cour&s;e by it &s;elf which,
as not relating to this Subject, I omit: Only thus far
'tis nece&s;&s;ary to mention (<HI>viz.</HI>) that it produced
another Meeting among them, with &s;ome Friends
on both Sides; in which it was agreed, that their
elder Brother &s;hould write a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Letter to his
Father; and that tho&s;e Friends, with his other Brother
and Si&s;ter, &s;hould do their good Offices with their
Father, to bring about a Reconciliation.</P>
<P>It is but too ea&s;y a Work, &s;ometimes, to bring
a tender, affectionate, and religious Parent to accept
of the lea&s;t Advances made by a di&s;obliging Child,
towards an Acknowledgment and Return: Nothing
is &s;ooner impo&s;ed upon, in &s;uch Ca&s;es, than a Fa|ther
de&s;irous of his Son's Amendment; nothing wil|linger,
and apter to believe the &s;eeming Penitent
&s;incere; and this was the Ca&s;e here.</P>
<P>Upon the receiving a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Letter from his
Son, and &s;ome interpo&s;ing Friends &s;peaking to it at the
&s;ame Time, the good Gentleman, with Tears in his
Eyes, pre&s;ently forgave the former Conduct of his
Son, and con&s;ented to a Reconciliation; tho' he &s;aw,
with a &s;ad Heart, that it mu&s;t be without reclaiming
him from his Errors in Religion, which he was
oblig'd to leave to the Divine Mercy; in which, as he
&s;aid, he could do no more than pray for him.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="109">
However, when the Friends, who acted as Medi|ators
between them, came to &s;peak to him of that
Point, <HI>viz.</HI> his forewarning, or forbidding his Son
from coming to his Hou&s;e, they found it difficult to
get over it; and the Difficulty lay upon this particu|lar
Article, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Father, knowing his Son's
in&s;inuating Temper, was afraid he &s;hould delude his
Brothers and Si&s;ters, who were yet but young, and
draw them over to his Opinions; and therefore, tho'
he did at la&s;t yield to his coming to the Hou&s;e, and
conver&s;ing with the Family, and &s;ometimes to lodge
in his Hou&s;e; yet he was inflexible in this Part, that
he would not con&s;ent to it, but upon expre&s;s Con|dition,
that he &s;hould never enter into any Di&s;cour&s;es
with his Brothers and Si&s;ters, upon any religious
Points whatever; but e&s;pecially &s;uch as were in Dis|pute
between the Papi&s;ts and the Prote&s;tants, except
when his Father was pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>This Condition, the Son agreed to, tho' with &s;ome
apparent Reluctcance; and with a kind of In&s;ult, or
Triumph, as if he would in&s;inuate, that his Father
was &s;en&s;ible, that the Popi&s;h Arguments would be too
&s;trong for the Prote&s;tants; and that he &s;hould be
wanted to qua&s;h Things by his Authority, where
Rea&s;on would be defective. In &s;hort, that his Father
was &s;en&s;ible he &s;hould have the Better of them, and
therefore, was afraid to tru&s;t it to a Di&s;pute.</P>
<P>However, as this did not reach his Father's Ears,
and that he yielded to the Condition, the Recon|ciliation
was made, and he was received in the Fa|mily
again; that is to &s;ay, as a Brother and as a Son,
tho' not an Inhabitant; and his going Abroad again,
was adjourned for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>It was plain, that, however he consented to the
Condition of forbearing all religious Di&s;putes, and
In&s;inuations of Popery in the Family, he never in|tended
to be bound by, or to perform it; which,
<PB N="96" REF="110">
in the End, brought on a &s;econd Breach between his
Father and him, as you will &s;ee in the re&s;t of the Story.</P>
<P>Not his Father only, but all his Brothers and Si|&s;ters,
received him with open Arms, and gave him
innumerable Te&s;timonies of a &s;incere Affection, and
a complete Reconciliation; and they liv'd, for a
Time, in perfect Amity, forgetting all that had
pa&s;s'd, and conver&s;ing with all po&s;&s;ible Freedom and
Kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>But he could not be content with the Liberty al|low'd
him; and as he never intended to keep within
the Bounds or Limitations which were &s;et him by his
Father, &s;o he &s;oon di&s;cover'd it; for he would be
always entring into Di&s;putes with them about Reli|gion,
wheedling with the younger Children (e&s;pe|cially);
for he did not much care to engage with his
elde&s;t Prote&s;tant Brother, or with his elde&s;t Si&s;ter.</P>
<P>Al&s;o he brought his Friend often with him, the
grave Gentleman that was with him before: Their
Friend acted with the utmo&s;t Cunning, and pruden|tially
keeping him&s;elf always under a kind of Re|&s;erve
of Civility, &s;eldom offered to interpo&s;e when
they were debating, never beginning any Di&s;pute
him&s;elf, and always moderating when they were
any thing warm; for the Brother was often apt to
be hot and pa&s;&s;ionate, and then the Stranger would
always &s;eem to be again&s;t him, and &s;o bring him to
Temper again.</P>
<P>But under this cautious and re&s;erv'd Behaviour,
he had infinite Advantage, and he fail'd not to
make me of it, with the utmo&s;t Artifice, to in&s;inuate
their Popi&s;h Delu&s;ions with all the po&s;&s;ible Gildings
and Varni&s;h, that plau&s;ible Error could have Occa|&s;ion
for.</P>
<P>He took this Caution tho', that he always began
the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es with &s;ome other Subject, perfectly
remote; and generally he introduc'd them with cu|rious
Ob&s;ervations upon A&s;tronomical or Philo&s;ophi|cal
<PB N="97" REF="111">
Points, pretending to acquaint the young inqui|ring
Heads with the Motions of the Heavenly Bo|dies,
their Revolutions and Influences, always clo|&s;ing
them with hand&s;ome and ju&s;t Remarks upon
the Wi&s;dom of the Creator, and the Power and
Government of his Providence, and &s;uch &s;erious Re|flections
as tended to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s the young People
very much in his Favour, as a very good Man, and
whole Religion, <HI>be it what it would,</HI> led him to
make the belt U&s;e of every thing, and that turn'd
all his Di&s;cour&s;es to a good End.</P>
<P>Having thus in&s;inuated him&s;elf into their good
Opinion, and that upon a Foundation &s;o rea&s;onable,
he had this Advantage by it, that it added a Weight
to whatever he &s;aid upon any other Subject: By
this Artifice, he gradually brought into Di&s;cour&s;e
religious Subjects of other Kinds, and e&s;pecially
&s;uch as render'd Popery le&s;s differing from other Opi|nions;
&s;uch as the <HI>Being</HI> of a GOD, again&s;t Athei&s;ts;
the Influence and Government of his Providence in
the &s;malle&s;t Matters, in Opposition to <HI>Sceptici&s;m</HI> and
<HI>Dei&s;m;</HI> the Divinity of Chri&s;t, again&s;t the <HI>Arians</HI>
and <HI>Socinians;</HI> the Authority of Scripture, and the
like; not failing on the Occa&s;ion now and then, but
with the utmo&s;t Subtlety and Caution, to bring in
the Difficulty of under&s;tanding &s;ome particular Text
in the Scriptures, and the Nece&s;&s;ity of an infallible
Interpretation, and how the Interpretation of all
Scripture &s;hould be left to the Church, and &s;o, at
la&s;t, to the Head of the Church, the <HI>Pope.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, in &s;hort, he gave Popery a &s;ure Footing in
the Minds of the younger Children, even while they
them&s;elves knew nothing of the Matter; Nor was
their Brother's Di&s;cour&s;e with them near &s;o dan|gerous
as that of this &s;ubtle Manager; for the Bro|ther
brought in his Popery like a new Convert in|deed,
with Heat and Pa&s;&s;ion, barefac'd, and pro|fe&s;&s;edly;
but the other couched it in the mo&s;t artful
<PB N="98" REF="112">
Manner, under the Cover of tho&s;e Things in which
we all agree; leaving upon their Minds fir&s;t a kind
of favourable Impre&s;&s;ion of the Popi&s;h Religion in
general, as not differing from us &s;o much as they
had &s;uppo&s;ed, or been told it did; and as agreeing
in the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Points, and &s;o making Room
for the Reception of the erroneous Part, as Things
indifferent, or at lea&s;t not &s;o e&s;&s;ential; and which,
being to be left to the Deci&s;ion of the Church and
of the Prie&s;ts, lay upon them to defend and to
an&s;wer for, if not right: And had their Brother
acted with the &s;ame Craft as this grave Per&s;on did,
who, by the Way, was certainly a <HI>Popi&s;h Prie&s;t,</HI> and
the &s;ame who had perverted their Brother; I &s;ay,
had he acted as artfully as the Prie&s;t, they had gone
a great Way to have poi&s;on'd the whole Family, as
to Principles; and, perhaps, planted Popery too
deep for all the pious Father's Endeavours to have
rooted it out again.</P>
<P>But the Brother did not &s;ee &s;o far into Things,
as the graver Gentleman did, nor had he Patience
enough to carry it on with a &s;uitable Policy: But
his Precipitation undid the whole Work, di&s;cover'd
the Breach of his limited Agreement, and brought
his Father and him to a new Quarrel, which put
an End, for a while, to the whole De&s;ign.</P>
<P>It is true, however, this was not pre&s;ently; no,
nor did the Father immediately differ with him,
tho' he knew that he did now and then break
out of his Bounds, being 10th, if it could have
been avoided, to come to Extremities with him.
But this occa&s;ion'd other Mea&s;ures on every Side;
for the Children, e&s;pecially the elde&s;t Daughter,
who was the Champion of the Family, under her
Father, always had Recour&s;e to her Father, when
either her Brother, or that artful Gentlemen had
offer'd any thing difficult; and &s;he never fail'd to
come back fortify'd again&s;t their Sophi&s;try, and
<PB N="99" REF="113">
made able both to confirm the young Children,
and confute him; and the happy Event of this
Method we &s;hall &s;ee as we go on: In the mean
time, when her Father found his Son had been
pu&s;hing at them, I mean the re&s;t of his Children,
with his Popi&s;h Arguments, and that he &s;eem'd to
make &s;ome Impre&s;&s;ion on them, he frequently took
the Opportunity to talk with them al&s;o upon the
&s;ame Points, that he might &s;ee whether his Son's
Di&s;cour&s;e had done any Mi&s;chief, or no; and that
he might fortify them again&s;t it: And this was the
Original of the following Dialogues.</P>
</SP>
<TRAILER>The End of the Third <HI>DIALOGUE.</HI></TRAILER>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4">
<HEAD>DIALOGUE IV.</HEAD>
<P>AS I have ob&s;erv'd in the former Dialogues,
that the Father perceiv'd his Son, notwith|&s;tanding
the Injunction he had laid upon him, and
which he had voluntarily con&s;ented to, did yet
daily break his Promi&s;e, and frequently engag'd the
Children in Di&s;cour&s;es, and Sometimes in Disputes
upon the Subject of Religion; and, which was
wor&s;e, that he found tho&s;e Di&s;putes made &s;ome
dangerous Impre&s;&s;ions upon them, he re&s;olv'd upon
a very particular Method for the e&s;tabli&s;hing the
Minds of his Children in the Truth of Religion.</P>
<P>He call'd them all together one Evening, and
told them, that he found, <HI>as above,</HI> their Bro|ther,
notwith&s;tanding he had engag'd to the con|trary
was continually battering them with his
Popi&s;h Delu&s;ions; that he prompted them to Di&s;|putes
<PB N="100" REF="114">
and tedious Debates upon the Subject of his
Religion; that he had Recour&s;e every Day to his
Prie&s;ts to furni&s;h him with Sophi&s;try and Cavil, to
direct him how to puzzle them with Arguments;
and that he flatter'd him&s;elf with Succe&s;s, perhaps,
from their being unable to an&s;wer him to all his par|ticular
Fallacies and Quibbles: He told them al&s;o,
that he under&s;tood he brought a Gentleman (per|haps
a Prie&s;t, <HI>&s;ays the Father</HI>) to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his
carrying on the&s;e Disputes, which was &s;till a farther
Breach of the Terms upon which he con&s;ented to
admit him again into the Family: That he, the Fa|ther,
had Rea&s;on to re&s;ent this Conduct of his Son,
and withal he added, that he did not take it well
that they had enter'd into the&s;e Debates with him,
and had &s;uffer'd them&s;elves to be thus harra&s;s'd with
his Arguings and Di&s;putes, and had not acquainted
him with it, at the &s;ame Time they knowing it was
contrary to his Capitulation with their Brother;
and al&s;o, that it left them without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance
which he might have given them to defend them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>His elde&s;t Daughter, for to her he &s;eem'd to di|rect
his Di&s;cour&s;e, an&s;wer'd, in Behalf of the re&s;t,
That it was true, their Brother had frequently at|tack'd
them, and engag'd them in little Di&s;putes
about <HI>Popery;</HI> but that as for the Gentleman that
came with him, they mu&s;t needs &s;ay, he always be|hav'd
with &s;o much Mode&s;ty and Civility, that
there was not the lea&s;t Room to &s;u&s;pect him of any
De&s;ign; and that he often reprov'd their Brother,
and check'd him for being &s;o warm in his Di&s;cour&s;e;
that he always avoided religious Di&s;putes, but en|tertain'd
them with curious and plea&s;ant Ob&s;ervations
upon other Subjects.</P>
<P>Here her Father interrupted her a little warmly:
Other Subjects! <HI>&s;aid be,</HI> what Subject could he
di&s;cour&s;e of, that a &s;ubtle de&s;igning Head could not
<PB N="101" REF="115">
turn to pernicious Ends? But an&s;wer me this, Is the
Man a Papi&s;t, or is he not?</P>
<P>They &s;aid, they acknowledg'd he &s;eem'd to be on
that Side, but he behav'd with &s;o much <HI>Moderation,</HI>
that it was not ea&s;y to &s;ay po&s;itively whether he
was a Papi&s;t, or no.</P>
<P>Moderation! <HI>&s;ays the Father,</HI> you &s;hould &s;ay
Cunning.</P>
<P>They all &s;eem'd to take it ami&s;s, in Behalf of the
grave Gentleman, and repeating to their Father
the general Tenour of his Di&s;cour&s;es, as I have
mention'd above, in&s;i&s;ted, that he never &s;o much
as nam'd the Di&s;putes of Religion, or any thing
about it, but always &s;hun'd them: So effectually had
he blinded them by his artful engaging Manner,
chat they really did not &s;ee the Popery which lay
at the Bottom of it all.</P>
<P>Well, well, <HI>&s;ays the Father,</HI> I &s;ee he is a Papi&s;t
for all that, and I doubt not but he is a <HI>Popi&s;h
Prie&s;t</HI> too, as I told you before, and all this Smooth|ne&s;s
is but an artful Way to wheedle you into an
Opinion of his Mode&s;ty and Sincerity, that he may
find the Way into your Opinion, and add Weight
to what he may &s;ay, when he thinks fit to di&s;cover
him&s;elf more fully.</P>
<P>His Daughter &s;eem'd not to come into her Father's
bad Opinion of the Man, no more did any of the
re&s;t; but thought he wrong'd him very much in
&s;ugge&s;ting that he was a de&s;igning Man: But how|ever
&s;he &s;aid, tho' they were very &s;orry to lo&s;e him,
yet &s;eeing he, their Father, thought there was Dan|ger
in it, it was in his Power to di&s;mi&s;s both of
them again, in order to make him&s;elf ea&s;y, and
that they mould &s;ubmit to it, let it be how it
would.</P>
<P>Their Father, after &s;ome Pau&s;e, told them No,
he would not forbid their Brother, nor his Friend
coming to the Hou&s;e, no nor to go on with their
<PB N="102" REF="116">
Di&s;putings, and other Methods for carrying on
their Popi&s;h De&s;igns, for that would be to interpo&s;e
Power in&s;tead of Argument; but he would be con|tent
they &s;hould go on as they plea&s;ed, and do their
utmo&s;t for their Cau&s;e, upon Condition they (his
Children) would promi&s;e him, that every Time they
had any of the&s;e Engagements with their Brother
or his Friend, they would give him an Account of
the Points they argued upon, and, as near as they
could remember, what they had to &s;ay for them;
not that he would enter into any more Di&s;putes
with his Son, for that had been re&s;olv'd before;
but that he might, as was his Duty, and he hop'd
would be for their Benefit, give them a right Infor|mation,
arm them again&s;t Delu&s;ions and Error, and
&s;et the Que&s;tions in a true Light; that &s;o they might
judge for them&s;elves between GOD and <HI>Baal,</HI> be|tween
true Religion and Idolatry; for, <HI>&s;aid their
Fatter,</HI> I cannot &s;atisfy my&s;elf by any Means to
have my Children impos'd upon and deluded, and
not be able to open their Eyes, and give them
a true Knowledge of Things; but let me have but
Room to an&s;wer, and to inform them, and &s;et them
to rights, when they are deceiv'd, I de&s;ire no more,
let their Brother and his Prie&s;t do their wor&s;t.</P>
<P>They readily acknowledg'd that the Propo&s;al was
very rea&s;onable, and promi&s;ed accordingly that they
would give him a true Account of every Di&s;pute
that &s;hould happen among them, and, as near as
they could remember, the Arguments that were u&s;ed
to prevail upon them.</P>
<P>I matter not their Arguments, <HI>&s;ays the Father,</HI>
let me but know the Subject m Debate; I &s;hall
&s;atisfy my&s;elf with giving you a true State of the
Ca&s;e, with the Hi&s;torical Account of Facts, as they
lie, and as they are to be prov'd, and I dare ven|ture
it, that, with God's Ble&s;&s;ing, the mere Hi&s;tory
of Popery, in any Branch of it, and in any Part
<PB N="103" REF="117">
they can di&s;pute about, is enough, when rightly re|lated,
to &s;ecure any Prote&s;tant from being deluded
by them, in almo&s;t any Ca&s;e that can be disputed
upon.</P>
<P>Having thus brought his Children to con&s;ent to
his Propo&s;al, there was no Notice taken of it to the
elde&s;t Son their Popi&s;h Brother: But he came and
went, and his Friend with him; and they wrangled
and di&s;puted daily about Religion, as before; never
knowing that his Father had any Information of it;
nor did he &s;o much as &s;u&s;pect it, On the contrary,
he concluded, that if his Father had known it, he
Should &s;oon have found the Effect of his Re&s;ent|ment;
as he did at la&s;t, tho' upon a quite different
Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>As this was the State of the Ca&s;e, it could not be
long before the Brother gave an Occa&s;ion for the
Father to begin his Instructions to his Children in
the manner propo&s;ed; and the Subject, which fir&s;t
offer'd to be di&s;cours'd upon was, upon the Word
<HI>Catholick Church;</HI> which his Popi&s;h Son always took
Notice of, and laid a mighty Stre&s;s upon, in his
Di&s;cour&s;es among the other Children; telling them,
that there was but one Church of Chri&s;t in the
World, and that was the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> That
this was in ail Ages &s;aid to be the <HI>Catholick Church,</HI>
and that was to &s;ay the only and <HI>Univer&s;al Church:</HI>
He &s;pent a great deal of learned Pains to prove to
them, that the <HI>Roman</HI> Church was always call'd <HI>Ca|tholick;</HI>
and that to be Catholick &s;ignified Univer&s;al;
and that therefore the <HI>Roman</HI> Church was the Uni|ver&s;al
Church; out of which there could be no Sal|vation.</P>
<P>His Si&s;ter was a little &s;hock'd with that Part of
the Di&s;cour&s;e; and told her Father, that &s;he was &s;o.
<HI>Indeed, Sir,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>I find my Brother is always
upon the Catch with me;</HI> and it makes me &s;u&s;pect
<PB N="104" REF="118">

<P>Well, &s;uppo&s;e that; for, according to our
Principles, it is true, the Church of Chri&s;t is the
whole Body of Believers, where-ever and however
di&s;pers'd, as you &s;ay in the World, tho' we do call
every particular Society of Chri&s;tians a Church; and
&s;o does the Apo&s;tle, even when he &s;peaks but of a
Family, <HI>Phil.</HI> i. 2. <HI>To the Church in thy Hou&s;e;</HI> and
in the 2d of the <HI>Revelations,</HI> the Societies of Chri&s;t
in &s;everal Cities, are called the Churches; yet, when
we &s;peak in general of the Church, or of Chri&s;t's
Church, we mean the whole Body of Chri&s;tians in
the World, profe&s;&s;ing one Faith, united in one Hope,
believing in one and the &s;ame God, and under one
&s;upreme Government, even that of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,
who is the only Head of his Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>All this I under&s;tand, but he talks of tho&s;e
things in another, and a narrower Sen&s;e; and gives
it a particular Name.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Name, Child? I &s;uppo&s;e he calls it the
<HI>Catholick Church;</HI> does he not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what does he &s;ay he means by that?
does he not pretend, that this <HI>Catholick Church</HI> is the
Church of <HI>Rome?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="105" REF="119">
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and &s;ays, that there is no Salvation
but in that Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what does he pretend to mean by the
Word Catholick, and Catholick Church?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Sir! he &s;ays, he takes it for granted,
that we under&s;tand, that to &s;ay the Catholick
Church, is to &s;ay, the Univer&s;al Church, containing
all the whole Body of Believers in the World; and
as there are none can be &s;aved, but who believe in
Chri&s;t; &s;o there are no true Believers, but what are
within the Pale of this Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and what does he infer From hence,
then? I hope we that are Prote&s;tants are within the
Pale of this Church; for we believe in Chnri&s;t; and
&s;o there is no Harm done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, No, he will not allow that; He &s;ays,
this Catholick Church is the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> only,
and the Prote&s;tants are all Hereticks; are &s;hut out
from the Catholick Church; and therefore cannot
be &s;av'd till they return, and are received into the
Bo&s;om of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how does he prove all this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, Sir! He &s;ays &s;o many plau&s;ible things,
that we don't know how to an&s;wer; and tho' I
think he will never make a Papi&s;t of me, becau&s;e
I have &s;een &s;o many &s;imple things among them; yet
I don't know what to &s;ay for my Brothers and Si|&s;ters;
I am afraid of them; for he makes &s;trange
Impre&s;&s;ions upon them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say you &s;o! I am &s;orry to hear it: But I don't
doubt I &s;hall make all his plau&s;ible Stories appear,
as they really are, no more than Plau&s;ible and Sto|ries.
Pray call them in, and let me talk to you all
together.</P>
<P>Here his Daughter brought them all together,
and the Father, beginning where &s;he left off,
told them, he was &s;orry to hear that their
<PB N="106" REF="120">
elder Brother, who was already poi&s;on'd in
his own Principles by the Artifice of the Prie&s;ts,
&s;hould get ground among them, and pretend to
delude them into Popery; that he thought
they had been all along carefully in&s;tructed
in the Chri&s;tian Doctrines, and particularly in
Prote&s;tant Principles, in Proportion to what
their Age made them capable to receive; and
he had always, as Occa&s;ion pre&s;ented, warn'd
them again&s;t Popery, and Popi&s;h Errors, tho'
he did not fore&s;ee they would be a&s;&s;aulted thus
in their young Days, and within his own Doors
too; but &s;ince it was &s;o, and &s;eeing al&s;o they
were now all come to Years of Under&s;tanding,
to be able to judge of Things better than
they were when they were taught by their Ca|techi&s;ms,
and by the ordinary In&s;tructions of
their Mother, when &s;he was living; and by
reading Books, hearing Prote&s;tant Mini&s;ters
preach, and the like; he would take upon
him to run thro' all the Principles of Popery
with them, that is to &s;ay, tho&s;e that their Bro|ther
had in&s;i&s;ted &s;o much upon, and furni&s;h
them with &s;ufficient Arguments to prevent their
being deluded by him.</P>
<P>Then, directing his Di&s;cour&s;e to his elde&s;t Daughter,
to whom he was talking before, he repeated what
&s;he had told him, and bad the re&s;t take Notice
of it.</P>
<P>When he came to &s;peak of that Part of their
Brother's Arguments (<HI>viz.</HI>) of the Church of
<HI>Rome</HI> being the true Catholick Church, he turn'd
his Speech to them all; Thus I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;aid he,
your Brother argues, That as there is no being
&s;aved out of the Bo&s;om of Chri&s;t's Church, or,
as he calls it, the Catholick Church, &s;o the Church
of <HI>Rome</HI> being the Catholick Church, there is no
<PB N="107" REF="121">
being &s;av'd till you are reconcil'd to, and receiv'd
into the Bo&s;om of the Church of <HI>Rome:</HI> Is not this
the State of the Ca&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, &s;ays the Daughter; and &s;o they
all &s;aid too; for as the Father, I &s;ay, had turn'd his
Di&s;cour&s;e to them all, &s;o he ask'd them all the
Que&s;tion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, daughter, I &s;ee I mu&s;t take my old
Method with Popery, which I always found was
the be&s;t and mo&s;t proper Means to fence again&s;t it;
namely, to fortify your Minds in the Truth, by
&s;hewing you the Fal&s;hood and Fallacy of Popery in
general, and of all the Arguments in particular,
which the Papi&s;ts make u&s;e of to &s;upport it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I remember, Sir, you u&s;ed to tell my
Brother &s;uch black Stories of them, as made him
half di&s;tracted; for fir&s;t he was, as it were, re&s;olv'd
not to believe them, and yet, in the next Place, he
could not confute them; or deny the Matters of
Fact; and he was &s;o provok'd &s;ometimes, that we
could hear him cur&s;e us all for damn'd Hereticks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, I don't doubt that, Father and all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, good Manners made him forbear
that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not what his Manners might do to re|&s;train
him, but I am well &s;atisfy'd his Principles
would not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, he reproaches us all &s;till with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Reproach you, Child! with what?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why he &s;ays you treated the Catholick
Church with Je&s;t and Ridicule, and brought up old
Stories, in&s;tead of Arguments, again&s;t her; that
you always turn'd the Di&s;cour&s;e, which he began
with the greate&s;t Seriou&s;ne&s;s, into Banter, and end|ed
it all with telling a Tale.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Child; but could he &s;ay that I ever
told one Story of them but what was true?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, we did not come to that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="108" REF="122">
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, you &s;hall go farther with me: Did I
ever bring in any things, however ridiculous and ab|&s;urd,
but what I had their own <HI>Legends, Mi&s;&s;als,
Church-Regi&s;ters,</HI> or other authentick <HI>Books,</HI> written
by their own Authors, to &s;upport?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>We did not go &s;o far with him neither;
for we could not examine them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; but when you meet with it again, you
may ask him the Que&s;tion; I &s;uppo&s;e he will give
you Opportunity enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Yes: He is always reproaching us
with it; that this or that is one of my Father's old
Chimney-Corner Stories again&s;t the <HI>Roman</HI> Catho|licks;
and that it Is the way of the Hereticks, for
Want of Argument, to make Ballads and Songs of
the mo&s;t &s;acred things; turning it all to Banter and
Ribaldry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; but bring him clo&s;e to it: Tell him
your Father never brought any Stories, or Ballads,
or Songs, into his Di&s;cour&s;e, but what were their
own; and if they made &s;uch Stories and Ballads
them&s;elves, as expos'd them to the Je&s;t and Con|tempt
of the World, who&s;e Fault was it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>We can &s;ay that to him at any Time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I under&s;tand you, Child; you mean, I &s;up|po&s;e,
that you can &s;ay it, but that he will deny it,
and ask you to prove it: Now I will undertake to
prove it of every Thing that comes out of my
Mouth, and &s;o make you able to prove it too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hall be very glad of that; I am &s;ure,
he &s;ahll not want it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is, indeed, the ea&s;ie&s;t Thing in the World,
to expo&s;e Popery to Ridicule, from their own Books,
from the Extravagancies of their own Enthu&s;ia&s;ms,
and the Stupidity of their own Clergy; and from
thence it is, that I have always &s;aid, and repeat it
now, that the be&s;t Way to confute and confound a
Papi&s;t, and to confirm Prote&s;tants in their Abhor|rence
<PB N="109" REF="123">
of the Popi&s;h Delu&s;ions, is to do no more than
to &s;trip her naked, and hang her out in the open
Air; that by a clear and undi&s;gui&s;ed Sight of her,
every Chri&s;tian may judge for him&s;elf, which is mo&s;t
likely to be the faithful and true Spou&s;e of Chri&s;t,
the Prote&s;tant or the Popi&s;h Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, does he complain &s;o much of
being injured, and of being expos'd? If they have
expos'd them&s;elves, 'tis their own Fault.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let it turn upon that I&s;&s;ue, and let it be &s;een,
whether they are not the Publishers of their own
Shame: As to the Que&s;tion, Whether it be their
Fault, or whether it is an Infatuation from Heaven
upon them? That's a Que&s;tion of another Nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Brother pretends, 'tis the <HI>Devil</HI> who
&s;ets on the Hereticks to buffoon the Church; I u&s;e
his own Words; and to per&s;ecute the Servants of
Chri&s;t, the <HI>Pope</HI> and his Clergy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Child, whether the Church of <HI>Rome</HI>
be the Church of Chri&s;t, or the Pope and his Clergy
be the Servants of Chri&s;t, and who are the Per&s;ecu|tors,
they, or the Prote&s;tants, will be&s;t appear, as I
&s;aid, by letting them out in their own Colours, dre&s;&s;|ing
them up in their own Cloaths, and an&s;wering
them out of their own Mouths.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir, that's a Way will be the
mo&s;t &s;uited to our Capacities, and the ea&s;ie&s;t for us
to under&s;tand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us begin then, at the&s;e Two Articles;
(1.) The Meaning of the Word Catholick, and that
it &s;ignifies Universal; and that therefore, the Church
of <HI>Rome</HI> being the Catholick Church, is an Univer|&s;al
Church; tho' I &s;hall make it appear, &s;he is nei|ther
Catholick or Univer&s;al: And (2.) The Pope
being the Univer&s;al Bi&s;hop, or Supreme, and Head of
the Catholick Church; for upon the&s;e. Two
Points they build the whole Fabrick of Popery; and
<PB N="110" REF="124">
'tis upon the&s;e Two Heads, it &s;eems, that your
Brother pretends to argue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, it is &s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, pray, ask your Brother, when
you are upon tho&s;e Points again, if he remembers
one St. <HI>Pacianus,</HI> an eminent Father of their Church,
and who, in &s;ucceeding Times, was beatify'd, and
afterwards canonized?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be, he will &s;ay, he does not re|member
&s;uch a Saint.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, he will be a&s;hamed to &s;ay &s;o; for he
is one of the Saints who they pray to as an Interce&s;|&s;or,
in Spite of the Scripture, which &s;ays, there is
but one God, and one Mediator between GOD and
<HI>Man.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what if he, &s;u&s;pecting what will fol|low,
&s;hould not think fit to own him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>If he &s;hould not, bid him look in his <HI>Kalendar</HI>
for his Name; and tell him, you can find the Day
(if you look for it) when they celebrate a Ma&s;s in
Memory of him, and that you will put him in Mind
of it next Time you meet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, may we not know what this
Saint was, that we may be able to throw him into
my Brother's Way, if there is Occa&s;ion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, he was Bi&s;hop of <HI>Barcelona</HI> in <HI>Spain;</HI>
he was born in the Fourth Century, and died in the
Year 480.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But he was not called a Saint then,
I &s;uppo&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, he was beatifyed, as they call it, and
canonized many Ages after, when the Cu&s;tom of
Canonizing ancient Fathers, was brought into the
Church: and they wanted Red-letter Men to grace
the Kalendar.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e, at fir&s;t, they cho&s;e out good
Men.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="111" REF="125">
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, and the mo&s;t famous Men for their
Learning and Writings that they could find; and
therefore, I &s;aid, your Brother would not &s;ay, he
did not know St. <HI>Pacianus,</HI> for he was a very noted
Father of the Church, and was really a pious, good,
primitive, and Chri&s;tian Bi&s;hop.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if he owns him, Sir, what then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, ask him, if he will believe his
Te&s;timony.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps, he will &s;ay NO; or will decline
an&s;wering till he knows the Ca&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, he dares not &s;ay, he won't believe
the Te&s;timony of a canoniz'd Bi&s;hop of the <HI>Roman</HI>
Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what is his Te&s;timony given upon,
and in what Ca&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, this very Ca&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Mean|ing
of the Word <HI>Catholick</HI> is not Univer&s;al. The
Ca&s;e was this: This good Bi&s;hop, was a great Oppo|&s;er
of the <HI>Novatians,</HI> a Sect of Hereticks your
Brother has heard of: What they were, we may talk
of another Time; but the Bi&s;hop writing an Epi&s;tle
to <HI>Sempronianus,</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Novatians;</HI> and &s;peak|ing
there of the Name of <HI>Catholick,</HI> and of its being
given to <HI>Chri&s;t's Church,</HI> has the&s;e Words.</P>
</SP>
<P>&startq;Since the A&s;cen&s;ion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI>
notwith&s;tanding the Mi&s;&s;ion of his infallible Spi|rit,
there have appeared innumerable Sects and
Divisions in the Church, which have all been de|nominated
from the Names of their Authors; but
the Name of CATHOLICK, <HI>&s;ays the old Bi&s;hop,</HI> has
been, alone, continued in the true Church of
Chri&s;t, and that, becau&s;e &s;he is the <HI>true Church;</HI>
for the Word or Name CATHOLICK, <HI>adds be,</HI> is
by the learned Men understood to mean obedi|ent
(tho' commonly con&s;trued to mean, <HI>General,</HI> or
<HI>Univer&s;al</HI>): The true Church then, is only ho|noured
with the Title of <HI>Catholick,</HI> becau&s;e &s;he is
<PB N="112" REF="126">
the only Church, which is true and obedient to
the Commands of her Lord and Ma&s;ter, Chri&s;t:
They are <HI>Catholick</HI> becau&s;e truly Chri&s;tian, and
not Chri&s;tian unle&s;s obedient to Chri&s;t. My
Name, &s;ays the Holy Father, is Chri&s;tian, <HI>Chri&s;ti|anus
mihi nomen e&s;t, Catholicus Cognomen:</HI> My Name
is <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> my Sur-name is <HI>Catholick;</HI> for I have
vowed my Obedience to my Lord and Ma&s;ter
Chri&s;t, who&s;e Name I bear.&endq; Thus far the Bi|&s;hop:
What &s;trange Abu&s;es then, have the Papi&s;ts
put upon the Word Catholick? And how do they
fal&s;ly con&s;true it to &s;ignify Infallible and Univer&s;al?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a plain Te&s;timony again&s;t them in|deed;
I fancy, my Brother knows nothing of this
Saint <HI>Pacianus.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Or at lea&s;t, perhaps, he may know nothing
of this Epi&s;tle of his; but you may bid him look
for it among the celebrated Writings of that Saint,
and he &s;hall certainly find it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>We will certainly give it him at full Length.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, pray, when you do, ask him, if he
knows any other Title to give the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI>
in&s;tead of this of <HI>Catholick;</HI> for 'tis plain, that will
Hand them in no Stead, unle&s;s he will prove that
Church to be the mo&s;t obedient of all other
Churches, and the mo&s;t humble; and he will find
that a hard Task to do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe, Sir, he will talk no more of the
Word Catholick and Univer&s;al, after this Story is
told him; at lea&s;t, not for a while, or not in the
Sen&s;e he has done all-along: But he has another
mighty Plea in Favour of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI>
which he nails us all down with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, what's that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, he &s;ays, That we Prote&s;tants ac|knowledge
the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> was originally the
true Chri&s;tian Church, and the only true Chri&s;tian
Church in the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="113" REF="127">
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>What would he infer from thence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>No doubt, but that he would have us
tell him, why it is not &s;o now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what can be ea&s;ier to do in the World?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's what we are a little &s;hort in, and
he triumphs over us in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is only for want of knowing a little of the
Hi&s;tory of Things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true, Sir, we are not acquainted
with the Hi&s;tory of Popery; no, nor enough with
the Hi&s;tory of the Primitive Times of Christianity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Child, a little Hi&s;tory will &s;erve to ex|po&s;e
his Church, for the greate&s;t Seminary of Dege|neracy
and Apo&s;tacy, that ever was in the World;
and nothing is more wonderful in it, than that they
&s;hould de&s;ire to have any Search made into it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But is it true, that they were once the
only true Church, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, nothing like it: That the Church
of <HI>Rome</HI> was once a true Chri&s;tian Church, is mo&s;t
certain; that their Bi&s;hops were Holy Men, and ma|ny
of them &s;uffered Martyrdom for the Chri&s;tian
Faith, all this we grant; but it amounts to no
more than this, that &s;he was a Member of the Pri|mitive
Church, not that &s;he was the only Church,
or the whole Church; there is a great Difference be|tween
being A Church, and being THE Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>

<P>I tell you, Child, he was &s;o far from being

<P>That's a Mi&s;take too; for his Brother <HI>Andrew</HI>
was called at the &s;ame Time. See the Text, <HI>Matth.</HI>
iv. 19. He &s;aw them together, called them both
in the &s;ame Breath, not one after another; and they
both left their Nets together, and follow'd him toge|ther;
&s;o that there's no Seniority in that: They are,
if you will, the Two elde&s;t; but in their Call, ay,
and in their Obedience to that Call, they are Twins;
there's no Primogeniture in the Heavenly Birth

<HI>Peter.</HI></P>

<P>No, that's true, but, perhaps, it might:
However, the An&s;wer is to them all; it is in <HI>Luke</HI>

among you, let him be as the Younger; and he that is
Chiefs as he that dotb &s;erve.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then, Sir, they &s;ay Chri&s;t gave the

on Earth, &s;hall be loo&s;ed in Heaven.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is one of the grand Cheats of Popery:
'tis evident, that when Chri&s;t ask'd the Que&s;tion, in
the 15th Ver&s;e of the Chapter, <HI>But whom &s;ay ye
that I am?</HI> That he &s;poke to all the Di&s;ciples, or at
lea&s;t, to all that were pre&s;ent at that Time; &s;o by
Con&s;equence, <HI>Peter</HI> made the An&s;wer in the Name

Opening and Shutting, was likewi&s;e to them all.</P>

<P>If there be any Thing in that, 'tis to their
Di&s;advantage; for this la&s;t was the Words of Chri&s;t
after his Re&s;urrection, when he was glorify'd, as he
him&s;elf calls it, and when he breathed on them, and
&s;aid, <HI>Receive ye the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> See the 22d Ver&s;e.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, here &s;eems to be no Room for an

on many Occa&s;ions; particularly, St. <HI>Paul</HI> corrects
him, <HI>Gal,</HI> ii. 11. <HI>I wi&s;h&s;tood him to the Face, becau&s;e
be was to be blamed. Paul</HI> him&s;elf, in another Place,
&s;ays of him&s;elf, that <HI>James, Peter,</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> all of

<HI>Gal.</HI> ii. 9.</P>

<P>Tho' it was, yet, as our Saviour &s;ays, in ano|ther

different Account of him&s;elf, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> v. 1. <HI>the El|ders

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>He was &s;o far from commanding, that we
find him commanded by the re&s;t of the Di&s;ciples;
for the Apo&s;tles, which were at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> hearing
that <HI>Samaria</HI> had received the Word of God, &s;ent
<HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI> to them, <HI>Acts</HI> viii. 14. Now, had
he been Prince of the Apo&s;tles, they would not have
taken upon them, to have &s;ent him of an Errand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>That &s;eems rea&s;onable, indeed; he &s;eems
to be under Orders.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It all concurs together; if <HI>Paul</HI> was not infe|rior
to the very Chief, then, neither <HI>Peter,</HI> or any
of them, were Superior to him. If <HI>Paul</HI> might
with&s;tand him to the Face, and did charge him with
not walking according to the Truth; then <HI>Peter</HI> had
neither Superiority or Infallibility: If the Apo&s;tles
at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> had Power over <HI>Peter,</HI> to &s;end him as
a Me&s;&s;enger upon their Bu&s;ine&s;s, then he was not
their Superior.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I think, Sir, they call'd him to an
Account once, for his Conduct.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>They did &s;o, and he was fain to plead his
Cau&s;e before them, and &s;ubmit to their Judgment;
as you may &s;ee <HI>Acts</HI> xi. 2. They that were of the
Circumci&s;ion contended with him, &s;aying, <HI>Thou
wente&s;t in to Men uncircumci&s;ed, and did&s;t eat with
them.</HI> There's a down-right Charge.</P>

<P>No, no, far from an&s;wering &s;hort, as he
would have done, if he had been their Prince; He
&s;tands up, and pleads for him&s;elf, <HI>rehear&s;ing the

<P>Part of the SERMON preach'd by Dr. <HI>Smith,</HI>
at<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This <HI>Whittington-College,</HI> was a Popi&s;h Chap$ in London, belonging to a certain Religious Hou&s;e &s;ince $word$ moli&s;hed; and which &s;tood at, or in the &s;ame Place, wha$ Stands the Pari&s;h Church of St. <HI>Martin Vintry.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Whittington-College, London;</HI> in
the very Words as it was printed, <HI>Anno</HI>
1572. By <HI>E. T.</HI> an Ear-Witne&s;s.</P>
<STAGE>[I find this was a Piece of a Sermon of
Dr. <HI>Smith,</HI> preached to &s;upport the Doc|trine
of Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation; his Words are
the&s;e:]</STAGE>
<P>MY Ma&s;ters, you are in great Error con|cerning
the Ble&s;&s;ed Sacrament, and all
your Tru&s;t was in <HI>Cranmer, Ridley,</HI> and
<HI>Latimer;</HI> As for <HI>Latimer,</HI> he &s;aid, in open Di&s;pu|tation
at <HI>Oxford,</HI> that he had no Learning in
that Matter, but out of <HI>Cranmer's</HI> Book. Be|&s;ides
this, I di&s;puted with <HI>Latimer</HI> twent$
Years agon, and then he had no Learning
$s fo$ Cranmer, he &s;aid, that his Learning
came from <HI>Ridley;</HI> And as for <HI>Ridley,</HI> I di&s;put|ed
with him my &s;elf, now at <HI>Oxford,</HI> the other
Day, and I proved my Argument thus: <HI>Ill$|cui
Chri&s;tus obviavit Romae, fuit Romae;&punc; at Chri|&s;tus
obviavit Petro Romae; ergo, Petrus fuit Romae
That is,</HI> He who <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> met at <HI>Rome,</HI> was a$
<HI>Rome;</HI> but <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> met <HI>Peter</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> Ergo
<HI>Peter</HI> was at <HI>Rome.</HI> By this Argument
prove Two Things, and both &s;ingular M$|&s;teries
<PB N="123" REF="137">
of our Faith. <HI>FIRST,</HI> That <HI>Peter</HI>
was at <HI>Rome,</HI> again&s;t tho&s;e who clatter that
<HI>Peter</HI> was never at <HI>Rome. SECONDLY,</HI>
That if <HI>Peter</HI> met <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> bodily, as <HI>Abdias</HI> re|porteth,
and which I am &s;ure is true, or el&s;e
&s;uch an Ancient and Holy Father would never
have written it; then con&s;equently, he may
be as well in the Ble&s;&s;ed Sacrament as he
was met <HI>Bodily:</HI> To this <HI>Ridley</HI> &s;tood like a
Block, and &s;eeling him&s;elf convicted, an&s;wer|ed
nothing. Then, &s;aid I, <HI>Cur non re&s;pondes,
Heretice, Hereticorum Heretici&s;&s;ime?</HI> Did I not
handle him well? Then he denied the <HI>Minor,</HI>
which I proved thus: <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> met <HI>Peter</HI> going
out of <HI>Rome,</HI> and &s;aid, <HI>Good Morrow</HI> Peter,
<HI>whither goe&s;t thou? Peter</HI> an&s;wered, Good Mor|row,
good Man, whither goe&s;t thou? Then
&s;aid <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> I go to <HI>Rome</HI> to Suffer. What,
&s;aid <HI>Peter,</HI> I trow, unle&s;s I take my Marks
amis, ye be <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t:</HI> Good Lord! how do
you? I am right glad I have met you here.
Then &s;aid <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to <HI>Peter,</HI> Go back and Suffer,
or el&s;e I mu&s;t, <HI>&amp; pro te, &amp; me.</HI> When <HI>Ridley</HI>
had heard this my Proof, and <HI>Abdias</HI>'s Autho|rity,
a Doctor Antient and Irrefragable, he
an&s;wered never a Word. And thus I con|futed
<HI>Ridley,</HI> in the Audience of a Thou&s;and;
and yet you &s;ay, That <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was never Bodi|ly
on Earth &s;ince the A&s;cen&s;ion: Believe with
me, ye be in great Error; let this Argument
of mine Confound you, as it did <HI>Ridely,</HI> your
chief Champion.</P>

<P>That's true; well then, keep it for your own

it down, if I can remember it in all its Parti|culars.</P>

<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Child, I will write it down for you,

</SP>

<P>It is certainly a mo&s;t ridiculous Fable;
is it po&s;&s;ible they can impo&s;e &s;uch Things upon
the People?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, the Days of Popery were all
Days of Ignorance; I could furni&s;h you with a
great many as ridiculous, upon other Occa&s;ions.</P>

<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not wonder that the Prie&s;ts &s;hould

them.</P>

<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is &s;urprizing indeed in it&s;elf; but if
I go on, I &s;hall &s;hew you greater Abominations

about <HI>Peter</HI>'s being Bi&s;hop of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, truly, unle&s;s they can produce &s;ome
better Authority to prove it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, if his having been Bi&s;hop of <HI>Rome,</HI>
and if his Primacy, or Superiority, falls to the
Ground, I think all the Authority of the Pope
falls with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>How &s;o?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e he has no Superiority, no Keys
of Heaven, but what he derives from <HI>Peter.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="125" REF="139">
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know they call him <HI>Peter</HI>'s Succe&s;&s;or;
or he calls him&s;elf &s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and they have as little Rea&s;on for that
as for the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why is he not <HI>Peter</HI>'s Succe&s;&s;or, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, how can he be <HI>Peter's</HI> Succe&s;&s;or, if
<HI>Peter</HI> him&s;elf was never there before him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But he may pretend to be Succe&s;&s;or of St.
<HI>Peter,</HI> as an Apo&s;tle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and he does &s;o too, and therefore
exerci&s;es an Apo&s;tolick Juri&s;diction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;ee that, in &s;everal publick Acts and
Declarations, which the Pope has pa&s;s'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But we do not find that the Office of an
Apo&s;tle was ever continu'd in the Church, much
le&s;s was it made &s;ucce&s;&s;ive; the Appo&s;tles con&s;ti|tuted
no Apo&s;tles after them, but Pa&s;tors and
Teachers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I never heard indeed of any Apo|&s;tles
after them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor could the Pope &s;ucceed St. <HI>Peter</HI> as a
Bi&s;hop, becau&s;e <HI>Peter</HI> not only was not a Bi&s;hop
of <HI>Rome,</HI> but was not a Bi&s;hop at all; only an
Elder, a Servant, an Apo&s;tle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But as <HI>Peter</HI> was an Apo&s;tle, he could
make a Bi&s;hop; does not the Text &s;ay, Ordain
Elders in every City, that might be Bi&s;hops?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but then it does not appear that
ever <HI>Peter</HI> ordain'd any Elder or Bi&s;hop of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, if they cannot prove that <HI>Pe|ter</HI>
did &s;o delegate his Power to the Bi&s;hop he
&s;o made, I think they do nothing; for 'tis not
enough to &s;ay &s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I am &s;ure they can never prove it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not &s;ee then, how the Pope can be
call'd St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Succe&s;&s;or, if <HI>Peter</HI> never was in
the Place to be &s;ucceeded, and that he never de|legated
<PB N="126" REF="140">
his Power to them; yet they will have
it be &s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>They will have it be &s;o indeed, but they
make pitiful Work of it, when they go about
the Proof: Father <HI>Plautina,</HI> who is their be&s;t
Author, Mon&s;ieur <HI>Du Pin,</HI> who is the faithful
Collector of their Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Hi&s;tories and Hi|&s;torians,
both affirm, and I doubt not believe what
they &s;ay, that <HI>Peter,</HI> &s;ome Time before his Death,
con&s;ecrated <HI>Clement</HI> (now St. <HI>Clement.</HI>)</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the&s;e are Authors of Credit, Sir,
you allow that; and if they were hone&s;t Men,
they mu&s;t be allow'd in Evidence for good Wit|ne&s;&s;es;
this will go a great Way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>You urge all that can be &s;aid, Child, in
their Behalf; but then when you mention the Law
Part, I mean, that they being allow'd to be ho|ne&s;t
Men, &s;hould be receiv'd as good Witne&s;&s;es,
you &s;hould be an&s;wer'd as to one Thing, in which
your Argument is defective.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know, Sir, we are no Lawyers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true; therefore pray take the An|&s;wer
in Point of Law; a good Man, that is an
hone&s;t Man, who&s;e Character is under no Scan|dal,
is always a legal Witne&s;s; and tho&s;e being
hone&s;t Men, are therefore to be allow'd in Evi|dence
in this Ca&s;e: But then you mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h
between an hone&s;t Evidence te&s;tifying of his own
Knowledge, and the &s;ame hone&s;t Man te&s;tifying
by Report, or by <HI>Hear-&s;ay.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand that exactly, and I allow it
&s;hould be di&s;tingui&s;h'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>In Evidencing, the Di&s;tinction &s;hould be thus;
in the fir&s;t they need but affirm only; in the la&s;t they
mu&s;t bring other Evidence; or it is confe&s;&s;ing they
want it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="127" REF="141">
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is very plain. Now, Pray, Sir, do
they bring no Evidence? for I know they could not
be po&s;itive Evidences, they could affirm no Fact.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, they bring no Evidence; nor do they
offer to make Proof of the thing, only barely give
it as a thing undoubted; which is begging the Que|&s;tion
too, very gro&s;sly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's quite wrong, indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but they give the Particulars for all
that; and tell us, that when St. <HI>Peter</HI> commended
St. <HI>Clement</HI> to the Chair, and to the Government of
the Church of God, he u&s;ed the&s;e Words.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>The very Words, Sir! or only Words to
that Purpo&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, the very Numerical Words, the &s;ame
and no other, <HI>viz.</HI> 'The &s;ame Power of Binding
and Loo&s;ing I deliver to thee, which Chri&s;t left
me: Do thou, contemning and de&s;pi&s;ing all out|ward
things, promote, by Prayer and Preaching,
the Salvation of Men, as becomes a good Pa&s;tor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was excellent Advice; I doubt, the
Popes &s;ince that, have taken but &s;mall Care to ob|&s;erve
the Direction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>We may talk of that afterwards; and you
will &s;oon &s;ee, whether they have follow'd the Di|rection,
or no.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, did <HI>Clement</HI> immediately become
Bi&s;hop, Sir, upon this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, No, There the Pretence of the Succe&s;&s;i|on
meets with a terrible <HI>Knock</HI> (as we may &s;ay) in
the very Cradle: For, <HI>fir&s;t, Linus</HI> mounted the
Chair, and was Bi&s;hop 11 <HI>Years, 3 Months, 12 Days;</HI>
and next him, one <HI>Cletus</HI> &s;tepp'd in, and &s;at 12 <HI>Years,</HI>
1 <HI>Month:</HI> And then Per&s;ecution making the Chair of
<HI>Rome</HI> a dangerous Seat, and no body to be found to
venture into it, good old St. <HI>Clement,</HI> like a Hero,
and re&s;olv'd to be a Martyr, took it up; &s;o that
St. <HI>Clement</HI> was not Succe&s;&s;or to St. <HI>Peter,</HI> but to
<PB N="128" REF="142">
<HI>Cletus;</HI> and the Succe&s;&s;ion had an open Interruption
of four and twenty Years; that's the fir&s;t Flaw
in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And a very con&s;iderable Flaw too, Sir, in my
Opinion, and &s;o St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Exhortation Was wholly
neglected, at lea&s;t by that <HI>Clement,</HI> 24 Years; and
the Charge of the Church committed to others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's a &s;mall Matter with them. But this is
not all, Child; for this makes not only a Breach in
the Succe&s;&s;ion, but it makes an Ab&s;urdity in the
grand Principle of Popery; namely, the Primacy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be pleas'd to explain that Particular, Sir;
for I do not under&s;tand it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know, Child, the Pope claims to be the
Head of the Catholick Church, as he is the Succe&s;&s;or
to St. <HI>Peter.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, I under&s;tand that well enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, if <HI>Clement,</HI> or <HI>Linus</HI> and <HI>Cletus,</HI> or any
other, were admitted Bi&s;hops while <HI>Peter</HI> was &s;till
alive; then either St. <HI>Peter</HI> dive&s;ted him&s;elf of the
Authority which Chri&s;t gave him, and became &s;ubject
to &s;uch a vi&s;ible Head as him&s;elf had &s;et up, which
al&s;o (by the way) he had no Power to do; or el&s;e
there were two vi&s;ible Heads at the &s;ame; time;
which would be ab&s;urd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I under&s;tand it all now perfectly: Two
Heads at a time! to one Body too! why, 'tis making
the Church a Mon&s;ter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is: And &s;uch a Mon&s;ter as they will not
admit by any means; for this Primacy is their e&s;pe|cial
Favourite.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what do they &s;ay to it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, Nothing at all; but go on boldly with
the Affirmative; tell us it is &s;o; the Pope is St. <HI>Pe|ter</HI>'s
Succe&s;&s;or, and they are &s;ure of it; and you mu&s;t
believe it; and the Church has given you her Word
for it; and the Church being infallible, all &s;he
&s;ay$ is &s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="129" REF="143">
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is talking Folks down with great
Words.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But be&s;ides this, Child, they have put this
Very &s;acred Succe&s;&s;ion, and the Primacy that at|tended
it, upon a wrong Foot too; for if St.
<HI>Peter</HI> ordain'd and con&s;ecrated St. <HI>Clement,</HI> and gave
him, as is &s;aid above, all the Powers that Chri&s;t
gave him, (<HI>Peter</HI>) and to him, and &s;uch as he
&s;hould appoint in his Place; then St. <HI>Clement</HI> &s;hould
have appointed his next Succe&s;&s;or, in the &s;ame
Manner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And every Succe&s;&s;or &s;hould have appoint|ed
another; and &s;o on to the End.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly; how el&s;e can it be call'd a Suc|ce&s;&s;ion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And has it not been &s;o, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Far from it; for, on the contrary, the
Cardinals cho&s;e the Popes; and &s;o, as one Au|thor
&s;ays, the Bi&s;hops of <HI>Rome</HI> are rather the Suc|ce&s;&s;ors
of <HI>Simon Magus,</HI> than of St. <HI>Peter.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why of <HI>Simon Magus?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because the Cardinals have been often divided
into Factions and Parties in their Choice, often
over-aw'd by Power, brib'd by Money, &s;way'd
by Intere&s;t, bia&s;s'd by Favours, and, in a Word,
many Ways, I might &s;ay every Way, corrupted
in electing a Pope, and giving a Succe&s;&s;or to St.
<HI>Peter.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do the&s;e Things appear, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hi&s;tory is full of them, Child; nay, their
own Hi&s;tories: It would put an End to all the
other, and more needful Part of our Di&s;cour&s;es,
to pretend to give you the Particulars.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it would be very diverting, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hall give you frequent Examples of it,
in our other Di&s;cour&s;es, as we go on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, may we not know a little,
what has been the Con&s;equence of this Way of
<PB N="130" REF="144">
chu&s;ing the Succe&s;&s;or by the Cardinals; I mean
the Con&s;equences which have been evil: For other|wi&s;e,
I do not &s;ee but St. <HI>Peter</HI> might have ap|pointed
a Set of ordain'd Bi&s;hops to chu&s;e the
Succe&s;&s;or, as well as give every &s;ingle Succe&s;&s;or
the Power to ordain another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hould have &s;aid &s;o too, perhaps, if St.
<HI>Peter</HI> had done &s;o; but 'tis evident he did not;
nor do they pretend to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>If they do not pretend to it, to be &s;ure
he did not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to the Difference fir&s;t, this is one cer|tain
Difference, and which could not have hap|pen'd;
namely, that &s;ometimes the Cardinals have
been &s;o divided into Factions and Parties, that
they have cho&s;en Two or Three, nay, Four Popes
at a Time, and frequently Two.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>So the Church has been a Mon&s;ter indeed,
with Three or Four Heads on!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sometimes tho&s;e Heads have &s;o furioufly
oppos'd and acted again&s;t the true Chri&s;tian Spi|rit
of a Primitive Bi&s;hop, or Head of Chri&s;t's
Church, which was to be no Striker, not given
to filthy Lucre, and the like, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> iii. 3.
that they have pur&s;u'd one another with Sword,
Fire, and Blood; and have embroil'd, at lea&s;t,
the whole Chri&s;tian World in War and Confu&s;ion
to &s;upport them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>This indeed could not have happen'd,
if the preceding Bi&s;hop had always ordain'd one
&s;ingly to &s;ucceed him.</P>
</SP>

<LIST>
<ITEM>1. There's <HI>John</HI> XIII. <HI>Platina,</HI> their own Hi&s;to|rian,
&s;ays he had, from his Youth up, been
debauched with all Manner of Vice and
Wickedne&s;s; what Time he had to &s;pare
from his Lu&s;t, he employed more in &s;porting
than in praying; and, in a Word, that he
was the mo&s;t flagitious Rogue that ever was
before him: Pray mark he does not &s;ay, <HI>that
ever was after him.</HI> He cut off one Cardinal's
Hand; another's No&s;e; pull'd out the Eyes
of others; and the Tongues of others; com|mitted
Ince&s;t with both his Si&s;ters; drank
a Health to the Devil, call'd upon the De|vil
to &s;end him Luck at his Dice; and,
at la&s;t, he was taken and &s;tabb'd in the ve|ry
Act of Adultery. This, I hope, may
pa&s;s for <HI>One,</HI> in the Li&s;t of the <HI>Mo&s;t Holy
Fathers.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>Sylve&s;ter</HI> II. As <HI>Marcellinus</HI> &s;acrific'd to Idols,
&s;o <HI>Sylve&s;ter</HI> to the Devil. He was a Man
of great Study and Learning, but turn'd it
all to wicked Purpo&s;es; and, finally, to Ma|gick
and Conjuration; and, prompted to it
by Ambition, he &s;ought to Witchcraft and
<PB N="135" REF="149">
Sorcery; he obtain'd the Archbi&s;hoprick of
<HI>Rhemes,</HI> and then that of <HI>Ravenna,</HI> by the
A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Devil; and, at la&s;t, pu&s;h|ing
at the Triple Crown, he obtain'd it
by the Devil's Help too, but upon this ex|pre&s;s
Condition, that after his Death he &s;hould
be wholly the Devil's: It is true, he is &s;aid
to die very penitent; but that this was his
Character, to the very Time of his Death,
<HI>Platina</HI> acknowledges.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>Benedict</HI> IX. obtained the Chair by Magick,
that is by dealing with the <HI>Devil.</HI> The &s;ame
Author &s;ays, that, after a while, he was turned
out, and <HI>Sylve&s;ter</HI> III. cho&s;en; but that <HI>Bene|dict</HI>
got it again, and then &s;old it; &s;ay, &s;old
the Chair, Infallibility and all, to <HI>Gregory</HI> VI.
After his Death, he walked, as we call it, and
appeared to &s;everal, in the Shape of a terrible
Mon&s;ter. 'Tis al&s;o &s;aid, that he made Two
of his Fellow <HI>Magicians</HI> Cardinals; and that
they Three u&s;ed to meet in certain private
Places, and rai&s;e the <HI>Devil,</HI> in order to con&s;ult
with him for the carrying on the vile&s;t Things,
not fit to mention.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. <HI>Hildebrand,</HI> or Gregory III. was a Necroman|cer;
and when Pope, a Fury. He three Times
kindled War in <HI>Germany,</HI> by cur&s;ing the Em|peror
<HI>Henry</HI> IV. and declaring his Subjects ab|&s;olv'd
from their Allegiance; and was the Cau&s;e,
as Hi&s;torians relate, of the Lo&s;s of 300,000
Mens Lives; and thirteen bloody Battles which
were fought on that Occa&s;ion: Whence, he
was Sur-named <HI>Hellebrand,</HI> or the Brand of
Hell.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. <HI>Boniface</HI> VIII. got to be Pope by a Cheat;
cau&s;ing a Voice to be made thro' a Pipe, to
Pope <HI>Cele&s;tine,</HI> a harmless well-meaning Pope,
commanding him, as from Heaven, to quit the

<DIV3 N="5">
<HEAD>DIALOGUE V.</HEAD>
<P>THE Di&s;cour&s;es which happened between this
good Chri&s;tian in&s;tructing Father, and his
elde&s;t Daughter, and which are mention'd in the la&s;t
Dialogue, reli&s;hed &s;o well, and made &s;uch Impre&s;|&s;ions
upon his Children;that they, as well as him|&s;elf,
were very de&s;irous of having the agreeable
Conferences continued; and therefore, in a few
Days, the Father took Occa&s;ion to introduce the
Di&s;cour&s;e on another Occa&s;ion, which was thus:</P>
<P>Their Brother Frequently brought his Friends, as
he called them, with him to vi&s;it his Brothers and
Si&s;ters; and they always ob&s;erved, that mo&s;t times
that he did &s;o he endeavour'd to embark tho&s;e
Friends of his in the Di&s;cour&s;es which pa&s;s'd be|tween
the young Family and himfelf But one Time
in particular, his Si&s;ter happened to have a Prote|&s;tant
Mini&s;ter, and another Gentleman, at Dinner
with them; when he, with one of his Friends,
<PB N="139" REF="153">
which was, in &s;hort, a Prie&s;t, tho' he called him a
Doctor of Phy&s;ick, came to vi&s;it them.</P>
<P>After Dinner, he (the Brother) according to his
u&s;ual Manner, began to banter and je&s;t with his
Si&s;ter upon the old Subject; and &s;he being prepared,
by the Di&s;cour&s;es &s;he had had with her Father, be|gan
to je&s;t with him as fa&s;t; and particularly, &s;he,
every now and then, threw a Pope in his Way,
one of the Li&s;t; and would ask him, how he lik'd
the Picture, till her Brother began to be &s;ick of the
Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The Prote&s;tant Mini&s;ter &s;mil'd, &s;o did (the Prie&s;t)
the Doctor. The Gentleman who came with the
Prote&s;tant Mini&s;ter, was a Man of Learning, and,
as I think, a Profe&s;&s;or of Science, in one of the
Colleges at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> but whether in Orders, or
not, I do not remember; but, he was a Man of a
wonderful deal of Wit and Good-humour, had an
extraordinary Fluency of Di&s;cour&s;e, and he laugh'd
heartily in Favour of the young Lady, which, at la&s;t,
began to turn a little upon the Brother, with a kind
of Admonition, or Caution rather, that he &s;hould not
enter too far into that Part of the Cau&s;e; that he
would lo&s;e Ground by it; and that the Lives of the
Popes would not bear a Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The young Gentleman &s;aw too well, that he
&s;hould not be a Match for his Si&s;ter, and that Gen|tleman
for her A&s;&s;i&s;tance; and particularly, becau&s;e
the Gentleman had all the Stories of tho&s;e Things
at his Tongue's End; But he had &s;o much Cunning,
as to embark his Friend, the Prie&s;t and that Gentle|man,
in another Di&s;cour&s;e; in which, they di&s;puted
with much Learning on both Sides, and not a lit|tle
Art on the Prie&s;t's Side, who was a Man of
Learning; but had the wor&s;t of the Di&s;pute, as he
had, evidently, the wor&s;t of the Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>However, by this Turn, the Brother had the
happy Advantage of getting the Gentleman off of
<PB N="140" REF="154">
his Hands, and putting a Stop to his Si&s;ter's Satyri|cal
Turns, about the &s;candalous Popes; which Di&s;|cour&s;e
had almo&s;t put him into a Rage, the Evidence
of the Facts being manife&s;tly again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e Particulars being related to the Fa|ther,
the following Di&s;cour&s;e came on, <HI>thus:</HI> After
&s;he had told him, how her Brother &s;huffled off the Di&s;|cour&s;e
about the Popes, and gave her no Opportu|nity
to name them, as &s;he intended, &s;he added; And
then, Sir, our Friend Mr.&mdash;of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and
his Prie&s;t, fell into Di&s;cour&s;e; and my Brother, as
it were, li&s;tening intirely to them, and &s;eeming
plea&s;ed with their being engaged, bid us frequently
ob&s;erve, this, or that Particular, and &s;o we had no
Room to go on with the Popes.</P>
<SP>

<P>So, you have not given him their Names and
Stories as you intended.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what did the Gentleman di&s;pute of
pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, the Prie&s;t in&s;i&s;ted, that the
<HI>Roman</HI> Church was once acknowledged by the Pro|te&s;tants
them&s;elves, to be the mo&s;t true, ancient,
and only primitive Chri&s;tian Church; and being
once &s;o, &s;he could not have forfeited that glorious
Title, by any Errors or Malver&s;ation of her Mem|bers;
who, whatever they were, or whatever they
did, in Deviation from the Principles profe&s;&s;ed, the
Church could not &s;uffer any ju&s;t Cen&s;ure, unle&s;s
tho&s;e Deviations were likewi&s;e univer&s;al and general,

not degenerated.</P>

<P>I &s;uppo&s;e the Gentleman could give him an
Account of the great Defection in the <HI>Roman</HI>
Church, from the fir&s;t In&s;titution; for you &s;ay, he
had the Hi&s;tory of it by Heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and from the fir&s;t Practice too; he
was very particular.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>What could he an&s;wer to that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, he demanded an Account when,
and at what Time, tho&s;e Defections were made; un|der
who&s;e Government of the Church; and how far
the Church approved, or did not approve, in Ca&s;e
of any of the particular Deviations, which were
named.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>There was a general An&s;wer ready for that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the Gentleman had &s;o much of the
Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church at his Fingers End,
that he an&s;wered him almo&s;t to every particular
Ca&s;e locally; he is a Man of wonderful Memory.</P>

<P>Could the Prie&s;t &s;ay, there were no Defecations?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, he did not &s;ay that, but he in&s;i&s;ted
thus: If tho&s;e Things, &s;ays he, that we defend, and
that you Prote&s;tants condemn, be, indeed, Errors
and Innovations, yet they are &s;prung up in Modern
Time, &s;ince the Primitive Days of the Church,
when you acknowledge her to be Pure; &s;o that you
may certainly a&s;&s;ign the Times in particular, and
the Per&s;ons when, and by whom tho&s;e Errors and
Innovations were fir&s;t advanc'd and brought into the
Church; but this you are not able to do; <HI>Ergo,</HI>
they are not Modern Errors and Innovations, but
Primitive Truths.</P>
</SP>

<P>That Argument has a great deal of Popi&s;h

<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Why, fir&s;t,</HI> he denied that &s;uch Proof
could not be made; on the contrary, entring into

you, for &s;everal Things, which I was &s;urpriz'd to

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, 'tis a notable Point, how did it go off?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, after he had, as I &s;ay, rumag'd,
by Story, from one Age to another, and found
him Fathers and Authors for &s;everal capital Articles,
he went from them all, thus: But what, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI>
if we could not name you Time, and Place, and
Per&s;ons, for all the Errors introduc'd into your
Church; it proves nothing but the Knavery of the
Regi&s;ters and Hi&s;torians in your Church, who have
razed out of their Regi&s;ters and Writings, what|ever
might be found there to their Prejudice; and
even in many Ca&s;es, the Regi&s;ters and Writers them|&s;elves,
filling their Libraries with fal&s;e and Legen|dary
Tales of Things incon&s;i&s;tent and unju&s;t, fal&s;e
both in Fact and in Chronology.</P>

the Books, and the very Chapters and Pages.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>That was a wonderful Memory, indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But that was not all; he told him al&s;o,
that, waving all this, he in&s;i&s;ted, that his Propo&s;ition
was fal&s;e; and that bringing in a certain Proof of
Time, Place, and Per&s;on, was not always practica|ble,
and, on the other Hand, not always nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="143" REF="157">
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is certain.</P>

and yet, no Certainty left to Po&s;terity of the pre|ci&s;e
Time when it happened.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true, and e&s;pecially is &s;o here, upon
the Foot of the Craft of the Prie&s;ts, who have, as
it &s;eems he told him, raz'd &s;uch Things out of the
ancient Writings, and &s;uppre&s;t the Originals, in all
Places where they have had Power in their Hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>

Proof of the Particulars, with re&s;pect to many
more than tho&s;e which, as I &s;aid, he had mention'd
before.</P>
</SP>

<P>He might have done it in many of the mo&s;t
con&s;iderable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But he in&s;i&s;ted al&s;o, that it was needle&s;s;
that it was &s;ufficient to prove the Error it &s;elf, and
that it was an Error, and that it was practi&s;ed in
the <HI>Roman</HI> Church; which was enough to prove it an
Innovation: no Error being allowed in the Primitive
Times, when the Church was Pure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hall add al&s;o, what another learned Au|thor
&s;ays of it; that the Errors among them now,
are &s;o notorious, that 'tis fitter to redeem the Time
by amending them, than needle&s;s to &s;pend Time
in proving when they were introduced.</P>

<P>In what, Child? What would you have been

<P>I would have been glad to have &s;een a
little of the Hi&s;tory of Error; and how, and when
it was po&s;&s;ible &s;uch a Multitude of &s;candalous Things
could be introduced.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, fir&s;t, Child, I &s;hall tell you; the Prie&s;t
was cunning in beginning to put the Prote&s;tant up|on
the Proof of Things that admit no Proof; but
I will &s;et you to Rights in that, upon Two Founda|tions.</P>
</SP>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Many of their Errors may be Hi&s;torically ac|counted
for, the Time when, and Per&s;ons by
whom they were introduc'd be a&s;&s;igned, and
that's enough to prove the Charge; namely,
that they have been guilty of Innovations.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Others, who&s;e Original and Authors are not to
be found, are to be proved upon them by their
Practice; and &s;o they are lyable to being made
the Authors, even in every Age.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. As it is not po&s;&s;ible to come at the Particulars
of &s;ome, &s;o it is not nece&s;&s;ary, &s;ince the Fact,
as above, is prov'd by the &s;ub&s;equent receiving
them.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>In the Parable of the Sower, 'tis evident, that
Tares were &s;owed; for the Servants brought the
Husbandman word, that they were &s;prung up;
What does the good Man infer? An Enemy has
done this; that needs no Proof: The Ma&s;ter of the
Farm did not do it, he would never have &s;owed
Tares among his own Wheat; it mu&s;t be a Rogue,
an Enemy: <HI>An Enemy to me, to my Family, to my
Hou&s;e.</HI> This the Husbandman declares.</P>
<P>But here comes the nice Inquirer; Who did it, and
when? what Enemy was it? The An&s;wer is direct,
<HI>viz.</HI> that The Que&s;tion is impertinent; it was done,
<PB N="146" REF="160">
that appeared. The Husbandman did not do it,
that was not rational; as to the Inquiry, <HI>Who?</HI>
The Text &s;ays, 'twas done while Men &s;lept; if
they were a&s;leep, how could they &s;ee them? And if
they did not &s;ee them, how could they produce them,
or tell who they were? If the good Man had known
what Hour, &amp;c. the Thief would have come, or
the Enemy would have come and &s;own the Tares,
<HI>Matt.</HI> xxiv. 43. he would have watch'd, but he
came unawares.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>That Story an&s;wers them very directly:
Errors like the Tares, were, do doubt, &s;own in the
Dark, while Men &s;lept, and were not aware of
them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be&s;ides, Child, the Introduction of Error is
always clande&s;tine; the Nature of the Thing re|quires
it; it mu&s;t be &s;o; 'tis a Work of Darkne&s;s;
People would not receive &s;uch Things in the Light,
with their Eyes open; <HI>in vain is the Not &s;pread in
the Sight of any Bird.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true, indeed, 'tis not likely they
&s;hould bring in &s;uch Things openly, in the Face of
Authority, and of Truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Again, the Doctrine we complain of, is a
My&s;tery of Iniquity; the whole Sy&s;tem of Popery
is a dark Cloud; 'tis a cunningly devi&s;ed Fable; My|&s;teries,
you know, are Secrets wrought &s;lowly and
by Degrees, craftily and &s;ubtilly, and not ea&s;ily to
be di&s;covered. The grand Here&s;ies of the <HI>Arians,</HI>
ths <HI>Ne&s;torians,</HI> and others, which I &s;hall name to you
hereafter; the Schemes of <HI>Mabomet</HI> and <HI>Socinus,</HI>
and &s;uch as tho&s;e, were open Violences offer'd to the
Church; like a Rape upon a cha&s;te Virgin, brought
on by A&s;&s;ault, carried on by Force of Arms, and
Terror of Soldiers; innumerable Legions proclaimed
their Doctrines and Dominion, and they knock'd
down all Oppo&s;ition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="147" REF="161">
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e, that was the Rea&s;on that they
converted whole Nations at once; that is to &s;ay,
forced them to own their Doctrines.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was &s;o; the Princes and Leaders of the
barbarous Nations, when, at la&s;t, they called them|&s;elves
Chri&s;tians, were generally <HI>Arians;</HI> and even
<HI>Con&s;tantius,</HI> the Succe&s;&s;or of <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Great, was
an <HI>Asian:</HI> So that Here&s;y was fix'd by the whole

out with Force and Violence as tho&s;e did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true; Popery, like a Chronick Di&s;|ea&s;e,
began &s;ilently and &s;ecretly in the Blood, them
getting a Head, &s;preads like a Gangreen.</P>

hatching its Eggs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>The <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Apo&s;tacy, is a &s;ecret clande&s;tine

the Church.</P>
</SP>

Fever is the harde&s;t to be conquered by Remedies;
it takes Root deep, tho' gradually in the Blood.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here&s;y, like Rebellion, is an Enemy bold
and adaucious, &s;hews it&s;elf by In&s;ult and De&s;iance
in the Day-light, and brandi&s;hes the Sword in the
Teeth of Oppo&s;ition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Apo&s;tacy is a &s;ecret Trea&s;on, ma|nagged
by Fraud and Con&s;piracy, and goes on with
a con&s;tant Supply of the &s;ame Arts, till it breaks
out in a Flame of general Practice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, &s;ometimes private Opinion may have
been broach'd, without any evil Intention, but
by falling into wor&s;e Hands, have been carried on to
Extremes, &s;uch as have turn'd into avowed pernicious
Errors; and thus petty Innovations have grown up
to mon&s;trous Impo&s;itions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="148" REF="162">
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how came it to pa&s;s, that the true
Profe&s;&s;ors, who always embraced and adhered to
the Truths of Religion, did not openly oppo&s;e
tho&s;e encroaching Errors?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, that may be accounted for too; &s;uch
true Profe&s;&s;ors there have always been, nor have
they been wanting, even in tho&s;e Ca&s;es, to oppo&s;e,
as far as they were able, the&s;e Innovations; but they
have generally been over-powered, perhaps, &s;ilenc'd
by Force, and &s;o &s;unk under the Weight, and obliged
to &s;atisfy them&s;elves, mourning in &s;ecret.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, perhaps, not thinking them&s;elves
oblig'd to break off from Communion, on Account
of differing Opinions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That fatal Charity has, indeed, done great
Mi&s;chief in God's Church, fearing to break off Com|munion
with the Church, where good Men content|ing
them&s;elves with not allowing the Corruptions of
Faith, into which &s;he fell, and cleaving to the Truths
which &s;he yet retained, have made the Change of
her Principles rhe le&s;s con&s;picuous, and have helped
to conceal Error by an over-charitable, but really
criminal Silence, at petty Innovations, till they
have grown up to fatal Defections from the Truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very plain, Sir, the greate&s;t Fire
bur&s;ts out from the &s;malle&s;t Sparks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thus for Example:</P>
<P>They that innocently granted St. <HI>Peter</HI> to be
Chief among the Apo&s;tles, little dream'd of giving
the Pre-eminence to a Pope, on Pretence of be|ing
his Succe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>They that at fir&s;t vigorou&s;ly urg'd Chri&s;tians to
Acts of Charity and Piety, Di&s;tribution of Goods
to the Poor, and the like; little thought that the
Doctrine of Works &s;hould be let up equal to Faith
and Repentance, be made meritorious of Heaven,
and Means of our Ju&s;tification and Acceptance with
God.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="163">
He that fir&s;t, for mere Ornament, and for Hi|&s;torical
Memorandums, to put us in mind of the
good Lives of the Saints and Martyrs eminent in
God's Church, cau&s;ed their Pictures and Sufferings
to be repre&s;ented, and hung them up, either in
their Hou&s;es or Churches; little thought, that, like
<HI>Gideon's</HI> Ephod, the People &s;hould go a whoring
after them; that they &s;hould be made a Snare to
them, that the People &s;hould wor&s;hip them in
Breach of the Second Commandment, and that Ido|latry
&s;hould come to be decreed for an Article of
Faith.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir; and &s;o, I &s;uppo&s;e, they who, in
Te&s;timony of the Re&s;urrection, and acknowledg|ing
the Mercy of God to their departed Friends,
perhaps, wi&s;h'd well to their Souls, little thought
it would be run up by the &s;uper&s;titious Monks, to
a Praying for the Dead.</P>

Beginnings; and which, for want of being
cru&s;h'd in their Birth, have come in&s;en&s;ibly on,
till they have laid the Foundation of prodigious Ex|ce&s;&s;es;
and yet the Progre&s;s has been &s;o in&s;en&s;ibly
&s;low in its Degrees, that we cannot trace the Begin|nings
of it.</P>

<P>I'don't think 'tis very material neither, whether
I we can or no.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, the Ca&s;e is this, In the ancient Alma|nacks,
when there was not &s;o many Red-letter Day's
as there are now, the Title of the Almanack was
printed upon the Head of the Leaf in red Letters,
thus, <HI>Kalendarius;</HI> which &s;ignified that the Book
was a Kalendar, or, in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> an Almanack.</P>
<P>In Proce&s;s of Time, and the fir&s;t Almanack-Ma|ker
being dead long before, the ignorant Printers
omitted the Line, which was u&s;ually placed between
<PB N="154" REF="168">
the Word <HI>Kalendarius,</HI> and the Head of the Co|lumn,
and &s;o <HI>Kalendarius</HI> &s;tood ju&s;t in the Column
above the Word New-Year's-Day.</P>
<P>Ignorance not declining in tho&s;e early Churches,
there happened &s;ome Doubt who this <HI>Kalendarius</HI>
was; but as it could not be que&s;tioned, that he was
&s;ome great Saint, with who&s;e Wor&s;hip the New Year
began, the next Year's Printers placed an S before
it, and &s;o in a few Years more, it was received for
Canonical, that this St. <HI>Kalender,</HI> was an ancient,
eminent Servant of God, and that he was received
as &s;uch by the Church, tho' his Story was not pre|&s;erved,
or el&s;e his Name would have been in that
Manner, in the Front of the Roll of Saints and
Martyrs: And thus, accordingly, the Title of the
Almanack is converted into a Saint, with this Ab|&s;urdity
added to it, <HI>Viz,</HI> that it makes Two fir&s;t
Days in <HI>January,</HI> or Two New-Years Days.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>May I tell my Brother this for a true
Story, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Yes, that you may, I a&s;&s;ure you; I will un|dertake
to bring you good Authority for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But he won't believe it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then take another Cour&s;e; Ask him
to &s;hew you his Almanack; and when you have
look'd it out, ask him who that St. <HI>Calendarius</HI>
was.</P>

<P>Indeed, I'll give it him at large, let him

and the Saints together, as to Principals; to hear, to
deliver, and to do for them what they want; and
that I may divert you all a little, I'll &s;hew you a
Piece of an old Popi&s;h broken Engli&s;h Sermon, or
Homily; which is to be found in a Popi&s;h Book,

is to &s;ay, the Three Days before <HI>Holy Thur&s;day.</HI>
The Prie&s;t being in his <HI>Ro&s;trum,</HI> or Pulpit, be|gins
thus:</P>
</SP>
<P>GOOD friends, the&s;e three days, that

Proce&s;&s;yon, man, woman, and &s;ervant: for
wee bee all &s;inners, and none may excu&s;e them
from the Proce&s;&s;yon that may lawfully be there.
Than hee that withdraweth him&s;elf fro the
Commaundement of holy Chyrche, wilfully,
he &s;ynneth full greivou&s;ly. Fir&s;t, he &s;ynneth in
pryde, for hee is unbuxom: Al&s;o he &s;ynneth in
&s;loth, that knoweth him&s;elf in &s;ynn, and will
not do his dyligence to come out thereby; and
ryght as he withdraweth him&s;elf fro the holy
Proce&s;&s;yon, ryght &s;o wyll God put hym from
<PB N="156" REF="170">
all the Company of Heaven, and from all
the Prayers that ben done in holy Chyrch,
till he come to Amendement. Therefore all
Chry&s;ten People come togyder and pray the&s;e
thre days to all the Saintes in Heaven to pray
God for us, &amp; put away all the power of the
Fende, &amp; kepe us fro all my&s;chefe, perylles,
&amp; drede that fallen more this tyme of the yere
than any other tyme: For in this tyme fall
many grete Thondres and Lightenyngs. And
as <HI>Lyncolnience</HI> &s;aythe, There were Fendes
that fluttered in the Ayre, for fere of the bla&s;te
of Thonder, when Chry&s;t came to Hell-gates
when hee di&s;poiled Hell: So yet whan they here
the Thonder in the Ayre, they bee &s;o aga&s;t
thereof, that they fall down, and than they go
not upp agayne, tyll they have done &s;ome
cur&s;ed dede, and make Tempe&s;ts on the See,
&amp; throw downe Shyppes, &amp; make debate
among folk, &amp; make one to $lee an other, &amp;
kyndle fire to brenne hou&s;es, &amp; throw down
&s;teeples &amp; trees, &amp; cau&s;e women to over-lye
their Children, &amp; hang &amp; drown them&s;elve in
wanhope &amp; di&s;payre. Now to put away all
&s;uch mi&s;cheves and power of the Fende, holy
Chyrche hath ordained, that all Chry&s;ten peo|ple
&s;hall go on Proce&s;&s;yon, &amp; pray to God &amp;
our Lady, and to all the Saints in Heven,
for &s;uccour. Wherefore in the Proce&s;&s;yons
Belles bee rongen, Baners bee di&s;played, and
the Cro&s;s cometh after: for ryght as a Kynge
when he gooth to a Batayle his Trompetts
go before, than the Baners, &amp; than cometh
the Kinge &amp; his ho&s;t; &s;oe the Belles bee Goddes
Trompertes, the Baners cometh after, than
cometh the Cro&s;s in Chry&s;tes likene&s;s, as King
of Chry&s;ten people. And as a cur&s;ed Tyraunt
will bee fore a&s;erde and adradde whan hee
<PB N="157" REF="171">
hereth the Trompettes of a Kinge that is his
Enemy, &s;o the fende the tyraunt of Hell, is
aferd &amp; dredeth him &s;ore whan the Belles
rynge, and the Baners ben born, &amp; the
Cro&s;s with all the people come, than he
fleeth and dare not abyde, and &s;o the Pro|ce&s;&s;yon
putteth away his power. We rede
of the Cytie of <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> as the people went
in Proce&s;&s;yon for a Di&s;ea&s;e that they had got,
as they &s;onge Letany, &s;odeinly a lytell Chylde

&amp; immortalis, mi&s;erere nobis;</HI> this is to &s;aye in
Engli&s;h, Holy God, holy &s;trong God, holy
God that never &s;hall dye, have mercy on us.
And anone hee was let down agayne to the
Erth, &amp; than hee &s;onge that &s;ame &s;onge, and

<PB N="160" REF="174">
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know they make great Blu&s;ters, as you call
it, upon &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages in the Scripture; as on God's
commanding <HI>Job's</HI> Friends to go and carry their Sa|crifices
to <HI>Job,</HI> and that he &s;hould offer them up and
pray for them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, he mentioned that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that amounts to no more than this; that
it was a Praying to God for his Friends, while both
he and they were alive, and in a State of Prayer;
all one as we get Mini&s;ters to pray with us, when we
are on &s;ick Beds, or &s;end and reque&s;t the Prayers of
Fellow-Chri&s;tians a&s;&s;embled in the Church; which
is nothing at all to the Purpo&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, truly, that's quite another Thing,
than praying to them when they are in Heaven.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>E&s;pecially too, when we don't know whether
they are there or no.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I take praying to them, to be wor&s;hipping
of them; and we are forbidden to wor&s;hip any
Thing but God alone; I think they were our Sa|viour's
Words to the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Without Doubt, Praying is Wor&s;hipping, in
the highe&s;t Degree of Wor&s;hip.</P>

<P>But they come off of it, by &s;aying, they
only de&s;ire them to pray for us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But in &s;aying &s;o, they &s;peak fal&s;ely; for their
own Prayers contradict it, as I told you, in the Ca&s;e
of the praying to St. <HI>Roch:</HI> But &s;uppo&s;e that, does
not the Scripture &s;ay, there is One God, One Me|diator?
that is to &s;ay, but One Mediator, as but
One God; as if it had &s;aid, there is no more a
Multiplicity of Mediators, than of Gods: How
then can they make the Saints departed, to be Me|diators?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

I think.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be&s;ides, Child, there is another Difficulty in
the Way; and which, if they cannot remove, then
<PB N="161" REF="175">
praying to the Saints is the greate&s;t Ab&s;urdity in
Nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, what is that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, &s;uppo&s;ing the Saints they pray to, are
real Saints, and are really in Heaven, how do they
know, or can they prove from Scripture, that the
Souls of the Ble&s;&s;ed, however happy them&s;elves,
have any Knowledge, or can take any Notice of
human Affairs? Which, if they have not, and can|not,
as is very likely, then how can they know their
Wants, or hear their Petitions? And if the Saints
in Heaven cannot hear them, what Non&s;en&s;e is it
to put up Petitions to tho&s;e that can take no Cogni|zance
of them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>They &s;ay, the Saints can hear them; and
I do not doubt, but they believe they can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>They may &s;o, and believe it too; and that's
as favourable a Thing as you can &s;ay of them, in
which they are to be pitied, indeed; but they cannot
prove it, nor have they one Place of Scripture that
makes it probable, much le&s;s confirms it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>They tell us, <HI>Abraham</HI> heard <HI>Dives</HI> from
Hell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's but a Parable, Child, and is only a
beautiful Allu&s;ion, to let forth the Condition of
lo&s;t Souls, in that irrecoverable State; and if it were
Fact, it is a Vi&s;ion from the &s;ame State, tho' in dif|fering
Particulars, I mean, a State of Eternity; it
is not a praying from this State of Life, to a State of
Eternity; and take it with all the re&s;t, you &s;ee <HI>Abra|ham</HI>
rejects his Petition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true; I think that don't help 'em
at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, upon the whole, if it is bur doubtful
whether they can hear us or no, 'tis mo&s;t ab&s;urd,
to pray to them, of whom we are not certain they
can hear us; and there is &s;o much Weight in this,
that the Scripture &s;eems to be particularly careful
<PB N="162" REF="176">
to confirm our Faith in that one Thing; that if we
pray to <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> he hears us, 1 <HI>John</HI> v. 14. <HI>This
is the Confidence that we have in him, that if we ask any
thing according to his Will, he</HI> HEARETH <HI>us.</HI> And
ver. 15. <HI>And if we know that he hear us, what&s;oever
we ask, we know that we have the Petitions that we
de&s;ired of him.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is very remarkable; I know there
are many Places to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e in the Bible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would be very uncomfortable Praying, even
to God him&s;elf, if we were not well a&s;&s;ured, that
he both can and would hear us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are no A&s;&s;urances, as I remember,
that the Saints either can or will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not one; you may challenge them to &s;hew
you, where ever any of the Saints, when on Earth,
promi&s;ed their Followers to intercede for them,
when they came to Heaven, or to hear their Prayers
there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, I remember when &s;ome of their
People were hang'd here for Trea&s;on, and inten|tional
Murther, the poor ignorant Papi&s;ts came to
them into <HI>Newgate,</HI> to de&s;ire they would pray for
them, when they came to Heaven.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And they promis'd they would too; and,
perhaps, did not break their Words.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e, Sir, you mean, that they ne|ver
came there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis very doubtful, whether they did or no,
I confe&s;s, for they were hang'd for Trea&s;on and
A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, which they never repented of, nay,
declared them&s;elves not to repent of it; yet the
Papi&s;ts pray to &s;uch as them, to this Day, as Father
<HI>Garnet</HI> for Example.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, &s;uppo&s;e it was to &s;ome Saints, who
we have Rea&s;on to believe are in Heaven?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="163" REF="177">

<P>Well, &s;uppo&s;e that, there is not one Word in

<P>I believe not, indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I am very &s;ure, there is neither Precept or
Example for it in the Scripture; on the contrary,
there are &s;everal Texts which tell us, the Saints can|not
hear us, if they are in Heaven. <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;ays,
<HI>Eccl.</HI> ix. 5. <HI>The Dead know nothing at all;</HI> that is to
&s;ay, of human Affairs; it mu&s;t be &s;o under&s;tood, or
el&s;e we &s;hall run into Soul-&s;leeping Errors again. <HI>I&s;a.</HI>
lviii. 16. <HI>Abraham</HI> is &s;aid to be <HI>Ignorant of us.</HI> The
be&s;t Writers among the Popi&s;h Party, have never
yet determined this Ca&s;e, even to the Satisfaction of
their own Con&s;ciences, how the Saints know our
Wants; and they have rai&s;ed many Cavils about
the Manner, which them&s;elves have not yet an&s;wer|ed.
Ble&s;&s;ed be God, Prote&s;tants have a more &s;ure
Word of Prophe&s;y; namely, a Way revealed, of
praying to God, in the Name of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the
only Mediator and Advocate; a Way which God
has commanded, Chri&s;t him&s;elf recommended, and
both promi&s;ed to hear and an&s;wer us in: What
Need have we of more Interce&s;&s;ors, or of other Ad|vocates?
What need of praying to Man to intercede,
when the Only begotten Son of God, and, who is
in the Bo&s;om of the Father, has promi&s;ed to hear
us, and to do for us whatever we ask?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But they alledge, the Manner of their
Praying to them, is with a <HI>Salvo</HI> for all this, that
they only pray to them to pray, not to be Media|tors,
not to intercede.</P>

<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am &s;urpriz'd! Is it po&s;&s;ible that the

make the very Children of our Age mock them,

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but that is not all; but, Is it not as
wonderful, that the Prie&s;ts them&s;elves, who, if there

mu&s;t be Fools, and impo&s;ed upon, to believe the&s;e

<P>Nay, I don't know where it lies; they

<P>Dear Sir then, before we come to talk

the Ends they drive at in the&s;e Miracles, and the
Foundation and Rea&s;on of their pretending to
them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why Child, this will take up a deal of Time,

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why fir&s;t, then, Child, you are to ob&s;erve,
that it had been u&s;ual almo&s;t from the Beginning,
when any Prophet or Me&s;&s;enger of God began to
preach any new Doctrine to the World, to confirm
and &s;upport his Mi&s;&s;ion by &s;ome extraordinary Mi|racle:
It was the Cu&s;tom of the World, Mankind
expected it; nay, God him&s;elf comply'd with the

that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> him&s;elf might know that it was God that
&s;poke to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, he did &s;o, by the Fire in the
Bu&s;h, burning, but not con&s;uming; and <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> did
not que&s;tion it after this Wonder; nor did the Peo|ple

</SP>
<SP>

&s;toop'd &s;o far to the Infirmity of the Times, that he
confirm'd his Doctrine in the &s;ame Manner; as the
Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> told the <HI>Jows,</HI> in his Oration, at the

<P>After this, the Apo&s;tles did the like in all
the Places where they preach'd, as you may &s;ee <HI>Acts</HI>
ii. 43. and <HI>Acts</HI> v. 12. By the Hands of the Apo|&s;tles,
were many Signs and Wonders wrought before
the People.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, we read, Sir, of many of tho&s;e Signs
and Wonders; as <HI>Peter's</HI> rai&s;ing a Woman from the
Dead, <HI>Paul</HI>'s throwing off the Viper from his Hand,
<HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI> healing the Impotent Man, at the
beautiful Gate of the Temple.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And abundance more; nay, the Fathers of
the Primitive Church had this Power continued to
them, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, if we may believe the Hi|&s;tories
of tho&s;e Time, e&s;pecially in the Time of the
fir&s;t Ten Per&s;ecutions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then, I &s;uppo&s;e, they were not &s;o fre|quent
in exerting that Gift as the Apo&s;tles were be|fore.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, their Mode&s;ty re&s;train'd them;
but if it were nothing el&s;e, their &s;o patiently and
boldly &s;u&s;taining the Cruelties of their Tormentors,
was as evidently Miraculous as any other of the
Miracles wrought by the Apo&s;tles; and 'tis expre&s;s'd
among the Miracles of Faith in the Catalogue of
them, <HI>Heh. xi. Stopped the Months of Lyons, quenched
the Violence of Fire.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SP>
<PB N="174" REF="188">
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I &s;hould allow it does &s;o it the more
&s;trongly confirms what I &s;ay for the Primitive Chri|&s;tians,
many of them, did the &s;ame in the Time
of their Sufferings, the Fire re&s;u&s;ing to burn them,
or the wild Bea&s;ts to devour them; and that in the'
Fire, when it did burn them, they felt no Pain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>We do read &s;o, indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now from the&s;e Foundations the Papi&s;ts be|gan,
and having fal&s;e and erroneous Principles to
maintain, a Doctrine of Devils to e&s;tabli&s;h, lying Fa|bricks
to build, they had recour&s;e to lying Wonders
to enforce them; and this they have done with &s;uch
a Front, &s;uch an inimitable A&s;&s;urance, that nothing
can equal it; not the Devil him&s;elf ever put &s;o ma|ny
lying Wonders, and fal&s;e Miracles, upon the
World, in Three Thou&s;and Years before Popery,
as the Legends of the Papi&s;ts have furni&s;h'd us
with &s;ince the Year 600, or thereabouts, when their
Delu&s;ions fir&s;t took Place: And thus I have brought
down the Rea&s;on of their pretending to Mira|cles,
I hope, to your Under&s;tanding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, it is ea&s;y to under&s;tand it, as you have
&s;um'd it up; but I would fain know how, and by
what Arts they brought the deluded World to believe
them; or, as I might have expre&s;s'd it, how they
brought the People to be &s;o ea&s;ily deluded, and
to be impo&s;ed upon in &s;uch a Manner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is indeed pretty hard to account for, but
I place mo&s;t of it to the Account of the Witchcraft
of Enthu&s;ia&s;m; and I take Popery to have more En|thu&s;ia&s;m
and Agitation in it, than all the Religions
or Sects in the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, more than our <HI>John of Leyden's
Muggleton,</HI> or the <HI>French</HI> Prophets! that can ne|ver
be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I &s;ay it over again, more than all of
them, and Five Hundred more &s;uch put together,
if you could find them; ay, more than Pagani&s;m,
<PB N="175" REF="189">
and Mahometi&s;m, or Quieti&s;m, or whatever you
can think of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is new to me, indeed; I thought
they had Knavery among them, good Store; but
I thought, the Prie&s;ts had rather acted a Part, and
play'd the <HI>Faux</HI> upon us, than that they had been
really Enthu&s;ia&s;ts and po&s;&s;e&s;s'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I could give you a Li&s;t of their Enthu|&s;ia&s;ms,

<HI>Francis,</HI> St <HI>Ignatius,</HI> St. <HI>Bonaventura,</HI> St. <HI>Dominick,</HI>
and, in a Word, almo&s;t all their Saints, are emi|nent

to be found in the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some Stories, Sir, of that Kind would be
very in&s;tructing, and would do rarely well with us,
next Time we talk with our Brother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, your Brother, I think, is a little En|thu&s;ia&s;tick
him&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt &s;o, indeed, Sir, el&s;e he could ne|ver
take up with &s;uch Mimickry, as he mu&s;t needs
&s;ee among the Papi&s;ts, and as their Ma&s;s and their
Saints Wor&s;hip, is full of.</P>

<P>Does he never tell you of their Miracles?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, indeed, Sir, he is mighty full of
them; but he &s;ees we do but laugh at him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing can be a greater Te&s;timony of En|thu&s;ia&s;m,
than his embracing the Ab&s;urdities of their

Virgin, of the Cro&s;s, and the like.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, you was talking of their Saints,
I had &s;ome Opinion of their St. <HI>Francis;</HI> they &s;ay,
he was a mighty good Man, and left a great many
&s;ound Exhortations behind him, be&s;ides the &s;trict
Rules of a mortify'd Life, which they likewi&s;e &s;ay,
he practi&s;ed him&s;elf, in an extraordinary Manner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>He was only the greate&s;t Enthu&s;ia&s;t that ever
liv'd in the World: The gro&s;&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t incon&s;i&s;tent,
<PB N="176" REF="190">
and whim&s;ical of all our Sects in <HI>England,</HI> was al|ways
far beneath them, and never were able to
match their my&s;terious Follies. Not the Sweet-Singers,
not the Family of Love, not the Adamites,
that would go naked, the&mdash;s, who would eat
nothing but Roots and Vegetables, not the Anabap|ti&s;ts
of <HI>Mun&s;ter;</HI> not <HI>Knipperdolling,</HI> or <HI>Michael
Servet us,</HI> were more bla&s;phemou&s;ly Wicked, or hor|ribly
Enthu&s;ia&s;tick.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, pray, Sir, give us a Story or two.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I'll begin with St. <HI>Francis:</HI> When fir&s;t
he was converted, as he calls it, and while yet he
was an ignorant Layman, he fell to preaching Re|pentance,
to the People, in the Streets and Market|places,
till they, taking him for Lunatick, de&s;pis'd
and threw Dirt at him.</P>
</SP>
<P>Being &s;et upon by &s;ome Robbers on the Road,
when they ask'd him for his Money, he an&s;wers in
the Words of St. <HI>Peter</HI> to the impotent Man, and
&s;miling upon them, tells him, They &s;hould all live
to preach the Go&s;pel. Being then ask'd, Who he
was that dur&s;t talk &s;o to them? He an&s;wers, <HI>I am
the Preacher, the Me&s;&s;enger of the Great King, font
to go before his Face, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as he had gotten &s;ome Followers or Di&s;|ciples,
he immediately &s;et up to act like Je&s;us Chri&s;t,
and give them an Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Commi&s;&s;ion, &s;ending
them forth to preach the Go&s;pel, Go, &s;ays he, <HI>and
declare Peace to Men, preaching Repentance for the
Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins:</HI> Then, having gotten Seven &s;uch
as the&s;e, he divided the Globe into Four Parts, and
taking One of the Seven to him&s;elf, he takes One
Quarter of the World to him&s;elf, &s;ending the other
Six, Two and Two together, into the other Three
Parts of the Earth.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>This was a kind of Madne&s;s and Phrenzy,
a true Fanatici&s;m; there could be nothing of Re|ligion
in this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="177" REF="191">
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No matter for that, 'tis what his Di&s;ciples
call to this Day, an In&s;piration of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what Succe&s;s had it? If it had been
from Heaven, it mu&s;t have pro&s;per'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>If that is a Rule to judge by, indeed, it
might be from the Devil, for it came to little; fir&s;t,
for his own Part, his Quarter of the World, as a|bove,
being <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> he prepares fir&s;t to go and preach
to the <HI>Saracens</HI> in <HI>Syria;</HI> but being, by contrary
Winds in the <HI>Euxine Sea,</HI> driven back to the Mouth
of the <HI>Danuhe,</HI> and the Coa&s;t of <HI>Servia,</HI> he was
oblig'd to return to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> on Foot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did he give it over then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; he then tells his Di&s;ciples, the Spirit
has commanded him to go and convert the <HI>Numi|dians</HI>
and <HI>Miramolins,</HI> that is, in &s;hort, the <HI>Negroes</HI>
of <HI>Africa;</HI> but as this was a terrible long Journey,
and over a frightful di&s;mal Country, full of Lyons
and Tygers, and he was over-fatigu'd with the La|bour
of it, he falls &s;ick, and narrowly e&s;caping
Death, his Heart fail'd him; which, by the way,
would never have happen'd if his Call had been
from the Holy Gho&s;t; but &s;o it was, that he gave
over that Project.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e he took up &s;ome other De&s;ign
in the Room of it, perhaps, not &s;o hazardous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but every way as whim&s;ical, for his next
Undertaking was to convert the <HI>Soldan</HI> or Emperor
of <HI>Babylon.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did he go on any better with that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, he was di&s;&s;uaded from it much by his
Friends, &s;ays his Nephew <HI>Bonaventura,</HI> who writes
his Story, but all in vain; and away he goes, all
in Rags and Barefoot, with only a Loaf of Bread
in his Pouch, to travel over the De&s;arts, from <HI>Aleppo
to Babylon:</HI> When he comes to the Frontiers, he
yields him&s;elf a Pri&s;oner to the Soldiers of the fir&s;t
Garri&s;on, demanding of them to be carried to <HI>Ba|bylon,</HI>
<PB N="178" REF="192">
for that he had a Me&s;&s;age from the King of
Heaven to deliver to the <HI>Soldan.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did they carry him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but not till a great while, and fir&s;t they
&s;conrged him &s;oundly, then kept him in Pri&s;on,
and almo&s;t fami&s;h'd him; but he &s;till in&s;i&s;ting that
he was &s;ent by the God of Heaven and Earth, to
deliver a Me&s;&s;age of glad Tydings to the <HI>Soldan,</HI>
their Emperor, and that his Me&s;&s;age was of the
la&s;t Importance; and adding, that if their Empe|ror
&s;hould come to under&s;tand that they had &s;topt
an Amba&s;&s;ador coming to his Court, he would be
very much di&s;pleas'd: I &s;ay, at la&s;t they carry'd
him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, pray, was he receiv'd?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Emperor ask'd him, Who he was? and
whence he came? and particularly, What Bu&s;ine&s;s he
had with him? that is, with the <HI>Soldan.</HI> He, <HI>Fran|cis,</HI>
an&s;wered, That he was a Servant of the mo&s;t
High God, and that he was &s;ent to preach Salva|tion
to him, and to all his People.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is much the <HI>Soldan</HI> had not ask'd him,
Why the Great King that &s;ent him could not afford
his Servant better Cloaths?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>The <HI>Soldan</HI> ask'd him, What he meant by
Salvation to be preach'd? Whereupon he explains
to him the Chri&s;tian Doctrine; and offers, &s;ays
<HI>Bonaventura,</HI> (tho' I much que&s;tion the Truth
of that Part) to go of his own Accord into the
Fire, and be burned, to confirm to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis much the <HI>Soldan</HI> did not take him
at his Word, and try his Courage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, he did not, but laugh'd at him, and
the Courtiers having made &s;ufficient Game at him,
the <HI>Soldan</HI> bid 'em turn him out of Doors for a
Fool.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And &s;o he had no Succe&s;s. What did
he make no Converts at all?</P>

<P>No indeed, tho&s;e real Preachers, who were

<P>'Tis evident 'twas all what you call'd it

powerful Self-delu&s;ion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I take one Part of Enthu&s;ia&s;m to be Men mi|&s;taking
the turbulent Motions of their own Spirits, to
be the immediate Dictates of the Holy Gho&s;t; and
the Tempe&s;ts of the Brain, to be divine In&s;piration;
all which give the Per&s;on fal&s;e Notions of God,
and of Religion, mi&s;guide his Zeal, and corrupt his
Devotion; under the&s;e Delu&s;ions an Exce&s;s of
Warmth, and the De&s;ires of Service, run him upon
extravagant Undertakings, as Mi&s;&s;ions from above;
an Exce&s;s in good De&s;ires, he mi&s;takes for a
&s;acred Perfection; and the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Super&s;tition, he
accounts Meritorious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>This may well be called a Phrenzy, in|deed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But to return to their Favourite, the great
St. <HI>Francis.</HI> He was &s;uch a one in all the&s;e Ex|tremes:
Take him particularly in the meritorious
Work of Prayer: He takes it from the Command
that Men <HI>ought always to pray, and not to faint;</HI>
upon this, he undertakes it literally, like a true
Enthu&s;ia&s;t, and takes it for no &s;mall Merit to pray
continually, if not vocally, yet mentally, without
cea&s;ing.</P>
<P>In doing this, his Writer, <HI>Bonaventura,</HI> tells us,
He us'd to receive great Favours and Care&s;&s;es from
<HI>the Holy Gho&s;t;</HI> was often ravi&s;h'd in his Mind, and
wholly &s;wallow'd up in a certain wonderful Light,
internal and external al&s;o; &s;o that oftentimes, in
<PB N="180" REF="194">
the Exce&s;s of Contemplation, he would be quite
be&s;ides him&s;elf, in Raptures and Exta&s;ies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Oftentimes!</HI> I think, he &s;hould have &s;aid
<HI>always,</HI> be&s;ides him&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>In&s;omuch, &s;ays the &s;ame Author, that being
rapt up in Spirit, as it were in a Third Heaven,
as were the Apo&s;tles, and perceiving things beyond
human Sen&s;e, he was entirely ignorant of what was
doing before his Eyes. Thus, when he fir&s;t under|took
his Mi&s;&s;ion, he was &s;o taken up with the ex|alted
Notions of his great Work, that he regarded
no Human Affairs. He chang'd his gay Cloaths
with a Beggar, who he met upon the Road, and
took the Beggar's Rags in their &s;tead, and reading
that our Lord, when he &s;ent out his Di&s;ciples, charg'd
them to take neither Staff nor Scrip, he immediate|ly
put off his Shoes, laid a&s;ide his Staff, threw away
his Money, girded him&s;elf with a Rope, and went
a Begging.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think he put the Rope in the wrong
Place, it might have done as well about his Neck.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think he would have done the World a
Kindne&s;s, indeed, if he had.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And for his Money, could he not have
given it to the Poor? what need he have thrown it
away?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, to &s;uch a Degree was his Enthu&s;ia&s;m
gotten up in his Head, that he made it a Piece of
Religion, never to po&s;&s;e&s;s any thing, but to beg for
what he wanted, and keep no more of what was
given him, than ju&s;t that immediate Want required;
and this Rule he left to his Di&s;ciples.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do they follow it &s;trictly?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>They pretend to do it; but if they really
did, How came they by &s;uch magnificent Buildings,
&s;uch va&s;t Libraries of Books, and &s;uch great Tem|poralities
and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, as they had in this Nation,
<PB N="181" REF="195">
and as they &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;s in other Nations to this
Day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis all a Trick and Cheat; and, in my
Opinion, 'twas all a Piece of Hypocri&s;y from the
very Beginning, St. <HI>Francis</HI> and all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know what to &s;ay to his being a Hy|pocrite;
but certainly he was as great an Enthu&s;ia&s;t
as ever liv'd in the World; as to Money, I have
told you, he renounc'd it, he abhorr'd it, and thought
him&s;elf defil'd if he happen'd to touch it; if he
was invited to Dinner, by any Per&s;on of Quality, as
he often was, when an Opinion of his Sanctity be|gan
to make him famous, he would go, becau&s;e he
had read that Je&s;us Chri&s;t did &s;o; but before he
went, he would go from Door to Door to beg
&s;ome Pieces of dry Bread, and when he came to the
Table of the Per&s;ons that invited him, he would
ta&s;te nothing that was provided, but pull out his
Pouch, and fall to upon the Scraps he had begg'd,
and eat them, preaching all the while Repentance
and Mortification to the Company; and this Bread
he would call the Bread of Angels.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is not this part of a <HI>Voluntary Humi|lity,</HI>
which is condemned by the Apo&s;tle? <HI>Col.</HI> ii. 18.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing pleas'd him better than the Thoughts
of being a Martyr; and the Contempt the World
threw upon him, he took for a Species of Martyr|dom;
wherefore he de&s;ir'd nothing more than to be
revil'd and abus'd, and he had enough of it; for in
his own Country, he had, by his extravagant Be|haviour,
obtain'd the general Character of a Mad|man,
and &s;eldom was &s;een in the Streets without a
Rabble of Boys at his Heels, hallooing and flinging
Dirt and Stones at him: This delighted him
&s;o, that, ravi&s;h'd with Joy at the very Ignomi|ny,
he would march as it were in Triumph, ble&s;&s;ing
him&s;elf, that, as the Di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t did, he was
thought worthy to &s;uffer Shame for his Name,

<P>Not at all. How many Miracles are a&s;&s;ign'd
to the Image of the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, and in how
many Places? Particularly to name but Three, to
which Thou&s;ands of Pilgrims daily &s;lock, that is,
<HI>Notre Dame de Mount&s;erat</HI> in <HI>Catalonia; Notre Dame

<P>I have heard a great deal of that <HI>Loretta.</HI></P>

<P>Yes, it is &s;o.</P>
</SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would be a long Story, <HI>Child,</HI> to tell you;
all the Particulars, would take up a Book by it &s;elf;
but the &s;hort of the Tale is this: The Words <HI>Santa
Ca&s;a are Italian,</HI> and are as much as to &s;ay, the Holy
Clo&s;et, or Chamber. It is a &s;mall Room, about
44 Spans long, and 13 Spans broad, and 23 high;
they tell you 'twas the Room or Chamber in the
Hou&s;e of St. <HI>Ann,</HI> where the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> was born;
where &s;he lodged, and where &s;he was &s;hut in at her
Devotions, when the Angel <HI>Gabriel</HI> appear'd to her
<PB N="183" REF="197">
It is made of Cedar, and, as they pretend, was
built by St. <HI>Luke.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, was St. <HI>Luke</HI> a Carpenter then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard he was a Phy&s;ician, indeed, but
never heard he was a Joyner, or a Carver; but
they can make any thing of him for the Occa|&s;ion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>So here, I &s;uppo&s;e, the Virgin receiv'd the
Heavenly Salutation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and not that only, but <HI>here</HI> the Holy
Gho&s;t immediately over&s;hadowed her; <HI>here</HI> &s;he con|ceiv'd
of <HI>that Holy Thing,</HI> which the Text &s;ays,
<HI>Should be born of her;</HI> and to &s;um up all, <HI>here</HI> &s;he
continued, excepting when &s;he went abroad to vi|&s;it
her Cou&s;in <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> till the Time that &s;he
went with <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> her e&s;pou&s;ed Husband, towards
<HI>Bethlehem,</HI> where the Birth of Chri&s;t happen'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how can this be the Chamber? How
came it hither?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, that's the Fir&s;t of the Miracles: You are
to under&s;tand, that when the <HI>Saracens</HI> began to over|run
<HI>Judoea,</HI> and that this holy Place could no longer
be pre&s;erv'd inviolate, (it &s;eems the <HI>Romans,</HI> tho'
they were <HI>Pagans</HI> as well as the <HI>Saracens,</HI> did not
offer any Violence to it) the <HI>Turks</HI> making all
Places de&s;olate, and this among the other &s;acred Re|liques,
being in Danger; the Angels (how many,
the Legends do not agree in, for &s;ome &s;ay Two,
&s;ome Four) took up this <HI>Santa Ca&s;a,</HI> or Holy Cham|ber,
and carrying it from <HI>Nazareth,</HI> in the Air,
out of the Reach of human Power, &s;et it down the
&s;ame Day, upon a Hill or Rock, called <HI>Ter&s;atto,</HI> in
<HI>Dalmatia,</HI> near the Sea. This was the 12th of <HI>May,</HI>
1291.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps, there might be Four Angels, and
&s;o they held it up by the Four Corners.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="184" REF="198">
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Or, perhaps, like &s;pare Bearers to a Cof|fin,
Two went by its Side to relieve the other, when
they were weary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, it may be &s;o, for it was a long Jour|ney,
indeed, to go in one Day; for it's not le&s;s than
Six or Seven Hundred Miles from <HI>Nazareth</HI> to
<HI>Dalmatia.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But this was not all, for not being &s;atisfied
with the Place, and the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;triving to &s;pread
their Conque&s;ts all over that Country, the &s;ame An|gels
took it up again, and carrying it over the <HI>Adria,</HI>
that is, the <HI>Adriatick Sea,</HI> called now, <HI>The Gulph of
Tenice,</HI> they &s;et it down again, at the fir&s;t Land
they came at, being near the City of <HI>Ancona</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI>
being, perhaps, weary, and not being able to
carry it any farther; or el&s;e they would certainly
have carry'd it to <HI>Rome:</HI> Now this is not &s;o much
unlikely compar'd to the re&s;t of the Story, becau&s;e
they did not like the Place, it &s;eems, any better
than the other; for, in a little Time, they remov'd
it again, and &s;et it down where it now &s;tands, and
where the Virgin, it &s;eems, is not yet thought able
to defend her&s;elf by Miracle; and, therefore, the
Place is well &s;atify'd, and a good Garri&s;on always
kept in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, are they afraid the Place &s;hould be
carry'd back again?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, they are afraid it &s;hould be plun|der'd
by the <HI>Barbarians.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Plunder'd, of what, pray? You &s;aid, Sir,
it was only a Piece of a Hou&s;e, a Room or Cham|ber.
Is there any thing in it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>In it Child! Why yes, there is an Altar,
which, they &s;ay, was built by the Apo&s;tles; and
there's the miraculous Image, as they call it, of the
Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin; al&s;o there's the Stone, on which St.
<HI>Peter</HI> &s;aid the fir&s;t Ma&s;s; all the&s;e came over with it,
<PB N="185" REF="199">
except the Image of the Virgin, which &s;tands in a
Nich over the Chimney.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, that, indeed, they may put a great
Value on; but I fancy the <HI>Turks</HI> would not
make much of it; they would do little but kick it
about, and, it may be, burn it: I &s;uppo&s;e 'tis a
wooden one, I mean, the Image.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! You don't know what you talk of!
A wooden one! Why, her Cloaths are the Riche&s;t in
the World: She is covered over with Diamonds;
&s;he has I know not how many Crowns, &s;et with
Jewels of an immen&s;e Value, on her Head; the whole
Room is full of Trea&s;ure and Riches, without all
po&s;&s;ible E&s;timation or Account.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then the <HI>Virgin Mary</HI> was very Rich
&s;ure, and her Mother had her Hou&s;e well-&s;urni&s;h'd;
there was &s;ome Rea&s;on to bring it away from
<HI>Judoea,</HI> to a Place of Safety, if it was &s;o rich.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mi&s;take it again, Child, they brought
nothing (except the Altar and the Stone, as above)
but the naked Room, plain and homely; but of in|e&s;timable
Value, for the Remembrance of the great
Tran&s;action of the Salutation and Conception, men|tioned
above.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then how came it &s;o Rich now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, that brings me to the Point; the in|numerable
Wonders wrought here, by this miracu|lous
Image, have brought Millions to the Place: At
the Fea&s;t of the Conception and Nativity, all the
Cities and Towns round, are not able to entertain
the Pilgrims and Vi&s;itants, who come hither, to pay
their Vows, and make their Oblations; and none
comes empty-handed; Princes and Monarchs &s;end
Pre&s;ents hither, and &s;end their Petitions to her.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And &s;he hears them all, I &s;uppo&s;e.</P>
</SP>

<P>So great, that 'tis pa&s;t all De&s;cription; take
a little part of it thus: Fir&s;t there is the Image, as
above. The Mantle or Robe on it, is covered
with innumerable Jewels, as I have &s;aid; be&s;ides
which, &s;he has &s;everal others, tho' not quite &s;o
rich. The Altar is a Prodigy of Wealth, innume|rable
Lamps, Statues, Bu&s;to's, and other Figures of
ma&s;&s;y Gold, are &s;een about it: Twelve Candle&s;ticks
of Gold weighing Thirty-five Pounds each, and Thir|ty
eight of Silver, and Vermillion, hang round the
Room. 'The Trea&s;ury Chamber, which joins to it, has
Seventeen large Pre&s;&s;es, with Folding-doors, each Six
Foot high, in which are laid all the Jewels of Gold,

of the Saint, and then kneeled again, and &s;aid &s;uch

Multitude of Pilgrims kneeling on them; and they
came not from <HI>England</HI> only, but from all Parts of

and others.</P>
</SP>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That he read Le&s;&s;ons, and preach'd Sermons
to a Lamb, till the Lamb, being illuminated
by his &s;piritual Influences, kneels reverentially
down in the Time of his officiating, Bleats in
a mo&s;t humble Manner before the Image of
the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, and (to the eternal Con|viction
of all Hereticks) kneels again at the
Elevation of the Ho&s;t.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Being very Sick, and oblig'd to &s;ubmit to a
Cauteri&s;m or Burning, he thus &s;peaks to the
Fire before the Application, <HI>My Brother</HI> FIRE,
GOD <HI>has created thee beyond all other his Crea|tures,</HI>
beautiful, cha&s;te and fair, as al&s;o <HI>u&s;eful

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Take one more, however, of this &s;uper-emi|nent
Saint, you are to under&s;tand, that St. <HI>Francis</HI>
was wonderfully haunted by the <HI>Devil,</HI> for the mo&s;t
holy Men have &s;uffer'd the greate&s;t A&s;&s;aults of Sa|tan
in all Ages; but one Time in particular, the
<HI>Devil,</HI> thinking to ma&s;ter his Virtue, throws him|&s;elf
ju&s;t in St. <HI>Francis</HI>'s way, in the Shape of a
great <HI>Bag of Money,</HI> tempting him to violate his Vow
of Poverty: The Saint di&s;covers the <HI>Devil,</HI> whether
he &s;aw his cloven Foot hang out of the Bag, or by
what other Means I know not, and would not touch
<PB N="190" REF="204">
the Money; but bethinks him&s;elf of a Project to
&s;hun the Snare, and yet cheat the <HI>Devil</HI> of his Mo|ney
too; this was not to touch it him&s;elf, but
to bid one of his Di&s;ciples to take it; fir&s;t vowing
to build a Chapel and an Oratory with it; but the
<HI>Devil</HI> &s;mells out the Plot, and when the Monk came
to take up the Pur&s;e, the <HI>Devil</HI> turn'd him&s;elf into
a great Snake, and crept away; upon which, St.
<HI>Francis</HI> made that heavenly Remark, which is called
St. <HI>Francis</HI>'s Maxim to this Day, <HI>viz. That Money
is the Devil.</HI></P>
<P>Another Time the <HI>Devil</HI> got into the Saint's Pillow,
tho', by the way, other Accounts make him to &s;leep
always upon a hard Plank, and not to allow him|&s;elf
a Pillow; but it &s;eems, at this Time, he had a
Pillow, and finding the <HI>Devil</HI> was got into it, he
cau&s;es the Pillow to be violently &s;eiz'd upon, and
carry'd to a Nece&s;&s;ary Place, where, ripping up one
End of it, he &s;hook the <HI>Devil</HI> out into the Vault,
as if the <HI>Devil</HI> too, who got into the Pillow when
it was whole, could not come out without cutting it
open.</P>
<P>But of all the Impo&s;tures of his Life, that of his
<HI>Five Wounds,</HI> in Imitation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, exceeds
all the re&s;t; yet it is atte&s;ted by the Legend, and
believ'd by the People, and with that I have done
with St. <HI>Francis.</HI></P>

<P>The Tale is worth your hearing at large; but
I'll give you an Abridgement of it for your Memo|ry.
This St. <HI>Ann</HI> is &s;aid to be the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI>'s
Mother, and by Con&s;equence Grandmother, in the
Line of Nature, to Je&s;us Chri&s;t: By her Holi|ne&s;s,
and mo&s;t extraordinary Character, they would
a&s;&s;ume that the Virgin is immaculate, and born of
&s;o holy a Seed, as that &s;he had no original Cor|ruption.</P>
<P>Now a certain Female Society in <HI>France,</HI> call'd,
<HI>The Poor Maids of St.</HI> Jo&s;eph, take this St. <HI>Ann</HI> for
their Protectre&s;s, and tutelar Saint, and build and
dedicate a Chapel to her, recommending them|&s;elves
and their Chapel to the Queen Regent of
<HI>France,</HI> in a long Addre&s;s, full of a religious Rhap|&s;ody
of Expre&s;&s;ions, which to us Prote&s;tants are,
indeed, mo&s;t egregious Non&s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>After this Addre&s;s to the Queen, follows a &s;hort
Treati&s;e, call'd, <HI>The Prerogatives of St.</HI> Ann, where|in
&s;he is &s;et forth as the Wonder of Wonders
in this World. This Tract is divided into XII
Chapters, containing as follows:
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. The Silence of the Evangeli&s;ts, concerning the
Merits of St. <HI>Ann.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. The External Perfections of St. <HI>Ann.</HI></ITEM>

<ITEM><PB N="193" REF="207">
V. The Obedience of the Virgin to St. <HI>Ann,</HI> being
the Third Rea&s;on of her Prerogatives.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VI. The Glory of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, being the Fourth
Rea&s;on, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>VII. The Internal Perfections of St. <HI>Ann.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>VIII. Her Prayers.</ITEM>

<HEAD>DIALOGUE VI.</HEAD>
<P>THE good Father of this young Family, had
thus generally &s;et apart an Hour, or there|abouts,
every Afternoon, to entertain his Chil|dren
with u&s;eful and in&s;tructing Di&s;cour&s;es, &s;ui|table
to their Genius, and calculated &s;ometimes
to divert them, &s;ometimes to in&s;truct them, al|ways
to improve them: Sometimes he read u&s;eful
Books to them of Hi&s;tory, Morality, Divinity, as the
Occa&s;ion pre&s;ented; and in particular, &s;ometimes he
<PB N="197" REF="211">
explain'd to them the Errors and Here&s;ies, which
troubled the World, and gave them an Account of
the Per&s;ecutions which the Church of God had &s;uf|fer'd
in all Ages, and by whom; and the&s;e Two
la&s;t Heads nece&s;&s;arily brought him to di&s;cour&s;e of
the original Principles of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church;
and then the unhappy Apo&s;tacy of his elde&s;t Son
made that Part of his Work the more frequent, as
well as the more nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>But you mu&s;t ob&s;erve here, that the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es
about Popery, were not all together, but the In|&s;tructing
Father was oblig'd, more e&s;pecially, to
turn his Thoughts to the&s;e Things, at &s;ome of their
u&s;ual Meetings; becau&s;e of the frequent Attacks,
which his Popi&s;h Son made upon the Children, in
his ordinary Conver&s;ation with them, in which he
always in&s;inuated one or other of his Popi&s;h No|tions,
in order to wheedle with, and deceive them.</P>
<P>The Children were young, except his Second
Son, who was often from Home, and his elde&s;t
Daughter, who I gave an Account of before. His
Third Son, <HI>James,</HI> who tells you his Brother beat
him, becau&s;e he told him he pray'd to St. No|body,
was about Twelve Years old.</P>
<P>Two younger Daughters, one about 11, the other 8
Years old; &s;o that all of them were capable of en|tertaining
early Notions of the Idolatry and Ab|&s;urdity
of the Popi&s;h Religion, the Frauds of the
Prie&s;ts, the Pageantry of their Wor&s;hip, the villain|ous
Characters of their Popes, and the general
horrid Enthu&s;ia&s;ms, Forgeries, and Fal&s;hoods, pra|cti&s;ed
by their Saints, Prie&s;ts, and other Promoters
of Popi&s;h Cheats in the World.</P>
<P>As the Father thought this was a proper Time to
in&s;pire his Children with the true Principles of the
Prote&s;tant Religion, and form ju&s;t Ideas in their
Minds, of the Errors and Fal&s;hoods of Popery, and
particularly, as I &s;aid, their Brother's In&s;inuations
<PB N="198" REF="212">
made it more than ordinarily Nece&s;&s;ary at that
Time; &s;o he &s;ingled out tho&s;e Points in particular
to talk to them of, as concurred to render Popery
more than ordinarily Ridiculous, and &s;uch as &s;uited
be&s;t with their Capacities.</P>
<P>He had gone thro' tho&s;e Heads in particular,
which take up the Three la&s;t Dialogues; re&s;pecting
the Pope's Succe&s;&s;ion to St. <HI>Peter,</HI> their Invocation
of the Saints, the &s;candalous Lives of the Popes,
their lying Miracles, and I have given an Account
of the Chief of their Di&s;cour&s;es; but one main
Point remain'd, <HI>viz.</HI> That of buying and &s;elling
the Pardons, and forgiving Sins before they were
committed.</P>
<P>The Children, who had, on all Occa&s;ions, been
well in&s;tructed in the true Chri&s;tian and Prote&s;tant
Doctrine, been duly and con&s;tantly Catechis'd, and
guided to the reading the Scriptures, had all of
them a competent Knowledge of Religion, in Pro|portion
to their re&s;pective Years and Under&s;tand|ings.</P>
<P>But they were amaz'd, and next to frighted,
when their Brother talked to them of having their
Sins pardon'd by the Pope, or by Indulgences,
ganted from his Authority; and that this was drawn
from the Words of Chri&s;t him&s;elf to St. <HI>Peter,
Matt.</HI> xvi. 19. and again to the re&s;t of his Di&s;ciples,
<HI>Matt.</HI> xviii. 18. and e&s;pecially after his Re&s;urrection,
<HI>John</HI> xx. 23. The&s;e things, &s;eemingly drawn from
Scripture, a little &s;tartled the Children, till their
Father came to tell them of tho&s;e gro&s;&s;er and ab|&s;urd
Parts of Popery; &s;uch as pardoning for Money,
pardoning Sins before they were committed, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
and they were all eager to hear their Father's Opi|nion
of that Part of Popery.</P>
<P>It happen'd one Day, their Brother had talked
very warmly with them, and upon this very Subject,
in&s;i&s;ting upon the Pope's Right, as Head of Chri&s;t's
<PB N="199" REF="213">
Church, to pardon Sins, as the Apo&s;tles wrought
Miracles in the Name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and as he
had a &s;ubtle &s;mooth-tongu'd Prie&s;t with him, who
back'd his Di&s;cour&s;es, and manag'd the poor Chil|dren
&s;o, that they hardly knew what to &s;ay, their
Recour&s;e was to their Father; and the next Day,
their Father, as was his Cu&s;tom, being talking to
them, but upon &s;ome other Subject, his Daughter
began thus.</P>
<P>Sir, I &s;uppo&s;e, you know our Brother was here la&s;t
Night, and his Friend with him; and that, accord|ing
to his u&s;ual Cu&s;tom, he has been, as he calls it,
infu&s;ing good Principles into us, in order to make
us good Catholicks; and, indeed, he has run us all
a-ground almo&s;t, about the Power of the Pope to
pardon Sins; we all of us wi&s;h you would lay a&s;ide
your Di&s;cour&s;e of other Things for this Time a lit|tle,
and &s;et us to rights, about that Point; for we
are not able to an&s;wer him, and his cunning Friend
the Doctor, (a Prie&s;t, we &s;uppo&s;e he is) is too
hard for us: Tho' we don't receive his Notions, yet
we hardly know what to &s;ay, or how to an&s;wer them.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is it they aim at, Child? What do they
pretend to?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, he &s;ays, that as Chri&s;t &s;aid to
his Di&s;ciples, <HI>John</HI> xx. 23. <HI>Receive ye the Holy
Gho&s;t, who&s;e&s;oever Sins ye remit, they are remitted;</HI>
and that the Pope is the Succe&s;&s;or to that Prince of
the Apo&s;tles, that Power remains in him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do they prove it from thence? For
they may as well &s;ay, that when Chri&s;t breathed
on them, and &s;aid, <HI>Receive ye the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> that
therefore the Pope has receiv'd the Holy Gho&s;t too,
which, con&s;idering what a Li&s;t of profligate Rogues
have been Popes, as I have told you of, would be
almo&s;t bla&s;phemous to mention.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>They in&s;i&s;t upon it for all that, and that
it is no matter what they were, as Men; they had
<PB N="200" REF="214">
the Holy Spirit, and all the&s;e Rights and Powers
by Office.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>How will they reconcile it to that Text,
<HI>2 Cor.</HI> vi. 14. What <HI>Communion hath Light with
Darkne&s;s?</HI> And to <HI>P&s;alm</HI> xciv. 20. <HI>Shall the Throne
of Iniquity have Fellow&s;hip with thee, which frameth
Mi&s;chief by a Law?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then they quote the &s;ame Words of
Chri&s;t to St. <HI>Peter, Matt.</HI> xvi. 18.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what's that to the Pope?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, they challenge it for the Pope, as
St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Succe&s;&s;or.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to that, Child, I have convinc'd you, that
they cannot prove the Pope to be St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Suc|ce&s;&s;or:
But, pray, ask the Doctor, next Time your
Brother brings him, How he will prove, that &s;up|po&s;ing
Chri&s;t gave that Power to St. <HI>Peter,</HI> he gave
him Power to leave it, like an Inheritance, to his
Succe&s;&s;ors?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not think of that, indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ask him, If he told <HI>Peter,</HI> that he gave it him
<HI>to Have and to Hold,</HI> to him and his Heirs for ever?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe, he will &s;ay he did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then ask him, Why he did not as well give
him Power, by laying on his Hands, to give the Ho|ly
Gho&s;t, as St. <HI>Peter</HI> had?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>He will an&s;wer, I doubt not, that he has
that Power.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then ask him, Why he does not give it to all
the Prie&s;ts that are taken into Orders, or to every
Body el&s;e, when he plea&s;es, as they did?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt not, but he will &s;ay, he can do it
if he plea&s;es.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>He may, indeed, as well &s;ay one as t'other;
but he can prove neither of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, about &s;elling tho&s;e Pardons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay; Why did not you ask him, If Chri&s;t
gave <HI>Peter</HI> Power to &s;ell tho&s;e Pardons? And whe|ther
the Text would not read thus; Who&s;oever will
<PB N="201" REF="215">
pay you for remitting their Sins, they are remitted;
and who&s;oever hath no Money, their Sins are re|tain'd?
or thus, Who&s;e&s;oever Sins you retain, for
want of Money, they are retain'd. This would have
been a little contrary to what Chri&s;t bid <HI>John</HI>'s Me&s;|&s;engers
tell their Ma&s;ter, <HI>Matt.</HI> xi. 5. <HI>And the Poor
have the Go&s;pel preach'd to them.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>This, indeed, will pinch them; but we
could not imagine, Sir, that they &s;old their Par|dons:
Why, mu&s;t no Body have their Sins for|given,
if they want Money?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, there are &s;ome mighty Pilgrimages,
and Penances, and performings of Wor&s;hip, to &s;uch
and &s;uch Saints, vi&s;iting &s;uch and &s;uch Churches,
and the like, to which the Pope is plea&s;ed to grant
Pardons in a mo&s;t extravagant Manner; but we
will talk of that by it&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir; but about this &s;elling Pardons;
I remember, when <HI>Simon,</HI> the Sorcerer, offered the
Apo&s;tles Money for Power to give the Holy Gho&s;t,
the Apo&s;tle curs'd him heartily for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and do you think, if he had offer'd
him Money for the Power of Binding and Loo&s;ing,
Remitting and Retaining, he would not have done
the &s;ame?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't que&s;tion it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray ask the Doctor that Que&s;tion next Time
you &s;ee him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I will, or, at lea&s;t, I'll ask it my
Brother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; but Chri&s;t did not forbid <HI>Peter</HI> to
&s;ell this Power of Remitting and Retaining; and,
therefore, his Succe&s;&s;ors, the Popes, do &s;ell it; and,
'tis very plain, this very Practice has blown up
their own Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>How blown them up, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, he that commandeth Light to &s;hine
out of Darkne&s;s, brought out of this accur&s;ed wor&s;t
<PB N="202" REF="216">
Act of Simony, the greate&s;t Good that ever befel

and Re&s;toration of Go&s;pel Light.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>How did that come from this Wickedne&s;s,

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why thus, <HI>Leo</HI> X. that voluptuous, avarici|ous,
bla&s;phemous Wretch, of whom I told you,
that he call'd him&s;elf <HI>The Lyon of the Tribe of</HI> Judah:
to &s;ent his Emi&s;&s;aries in <HI>Germany,</HI> to rai&s;e Money
to &s;upport his Ba&s;tards, by &s;elling Pardons and In|dulgences
to the deluded People: The Tools he

<P>I &s;uppo&s;e, they di&s;cover'd it them&s;elves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I have read, that they were frequently heard
to boa&s;t, how they couzen'd the People of their
Money; but, however, I don't affirm that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not very unlikely. Was it not that

we gain by this Fable of</HI> JESUS?</P>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>That's the Story I am going to tell; <HI>Martin

Wickedne&s;s of this Practice; and there, my Dear,
began the Reformation; but fir&s;t, let me &s;hew you
this Hi&s;tory.</P>
</SP>
<P>In an ancient <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Book, intitled <HI>The Cu&s;toms
of</HI> LONDON, there is a Bead-roll of the <HI>Hoole</HI>
Pardons, (&s;o 'tis called) granted by the Popes; and
among the re&s;t, this Story.</P>
<P>THAT, in the Chirch of St. <HI>John La|tryneus
(I give it in the</HI> Old Engli&s;h, <HI>as it
was written</HI>) Pope <HI>Sylve&s;ter</HI> yaf (<HI>that is
gave</HI>) thereto as many yeares Pardon, as it
reyned Drops of Water the Day that Hal|lowy'd
the Chyrchs; at what Time it reyned
&s;o &s;ore, that no Man had &s;een a greater Reyne
before that Day: And when he had graunted
this, he thought in him&s;elf (<HI>as well he might</HI>)
whedyr he had &s;o much Power or not: Then
there came a Voyce fro Hevyn, and &s;aid, <HI>Syl|ve&s;ter,</HI>
Thou ha&s;t Power enough to yeve that
Pardon; and God graunted (<HI>that's added</HI>)
this much thereto, That, and a Man (<HI>or if a

lacked good to doe his Pilgrimage (<HI>that is
Money to pay his Charges</HI>) If he go fro St.
<HI>Peter</HI>'s Chirch to St. <HI>John Latrynes,</HI> he &s;hall
be Di&s;charged and have the Ab&s;olucyon of the
Promi&s;e.</P>
<P>Ble&s;&s;yd be the Modyr that beareth the Chylde
that heareth Ma&s;s on Saturdayes, at St. <HI>John
Latrynes,</HI> for he Delivereth all them that he
De&s;yreth out of Purgatory, to the Number
of 77 Soules.</P>
<P>There is the Grave that St. <HI>John</HI> lay'd him|&s;elf
in, when he &s;aid Ma&s;s, and then come a
grete Light over the Grave; and when the
Light was Gone, then find they nooting there
but Hevenly Bred. In that Grave cometh
every Night the holy Cream and Oyl, and
<PB N="204" REF="218">
he that putteth therin his Hede, hath a Hun|dred
Thou&s;and Yere of Pardon.</P>
<STAGE>[But, alas! &s;ays the Author that copied this from
the Place, Who &s;hould run his Head in a Hole
for &s;uch a Bu&s;ine&s;s, when 'twas but going to
the High Altar in the &s;ame Church, and there
it was &s;et up again&s;t the Wall, to whoever &s;aid

<P>Likewi&s;e, Mr. <HI>Weaver,</HI> in his Book of <HI>Funeral

upon the Wall in the Chancel, thus; &startq;If any &s;hall

have a general Pardon of his Sins; or if it be for
a Soul departed, the &s;ame &s;hall immediately be

<P>Now what do ye &s;ay to this? Is this a &s;ufficient

<P>It is &s;trange, indeed, they &s;hould; but a blin|ded

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a Story by it &s;elf, and a Story worth
telling too, but it is too long: The&s;e very wicked
Doings brought it about; the Reformation broke
in at this Door: This was it that <HI>Luther</HI> preached
fir&s;t again&s;t. I'll tell it you by-and-by. The very

of Fact to bring them in: In the Year 1688.
during the famous Controver&s;y about Popery, Fa|ther
<HI>Pulton,</HI> a Je&s;uit, wrote a Book, call'd, <HI>Good
Advice to the Pulpits,</HI> in which he taxes the Church
of <HI>England</HI> Mini&s;ters with making unju&s;t Reflections
upon the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> in their Sermons.</P>
<P>Among the re&s;t, he falls upon Dr. <HI>Tenni&s;on,</HI> after|wards
Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> for &s;aying, in a
Sermon, That the Pope has <HI>oftentimes</HI> granted his
Bulls for Indulgence, for many Years Sins unre|pented
of; and that <HI>it is a common Practice;</HI> which
the Je&s;uit denies to be true, and demands of the
Doctor, Who tho&s;e Popes were?</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Tenni&s;on</HI> an&s;wer'd this Book, and tells the Je|&s;uit,
that he has fal&s;ify'd his Words; that in&s;tead of
<HI>oftentimes,</HI> he only &s;aid <HI>&s;ometimes;</HI> and for its being
a Common Practice, he did not &s;ay it at all: But
in order to &s;hew how near he had been to the Truth,
if he had &s;aid &s;o, he gives &s;everal Accounts of the
Facts, as Evidences, and &s;ome of tho&s;e Accounts
will make good what I am to explain to you about
Popi&s;h Pardons, for Services perform'd, as above.

<P>I could go on to load them with ju&s;t Reproach,
for &s;uch un&s;ufferable Things, as cannot be read
without &s;ome Horror; but we have not room
to talk of all their Points, they are too many;
&s;uch as:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Celibacy of their Prie&s;ts forbidding them
to marry, and yet at the &s;ame Time licen&s;ing
them to keep Whores.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Affirming and teaching, that it is not &s;o great a
Sin for a Prie&s;t to have a Concubine, as to be
marry'd to a Wife; &s;o that, in &s;hort, there is
more Care taken that the Clergy &s;hall live
<HI>&s;ingle,</HI> than that they &s;hall live <HI>hone&s;t.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. For the Puni&s;hment of either of the&s;e, the
fir&s;t being ab&s;olutely forbidden, cannot be com|pounded
for; for if a Clergyman marries a
Wife, he is in&s;tantly depriv'd; but if he only
keeps a Concubine he is fin'd Seven Gro&s;&s;es,
that is about Ten Shillings.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Their praying in <HI>Latin,</HI> or in an unknown
Tongue; they tell us, that &s;uch as pray in <HI>La|tin,</HI>
tho' they under&s;tand not what they &s;ay,
may pray with as great Devotion, and often|times
more, than tho&s;e that pray in a Lan|guage
which they under&s;tand.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. That good Works of ju&s;tify'd Per&s;ons are not
&s;o the Gift of God, but that they do truly
merit an Increa&s;e of Grace now, and Glory
hereafter.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="220" REF="234">
6. As to Confe&s;&s;ion of Sin, 'tis an Article in their
Catechi&s;m: &startq;That tho' a Sinner be not af|fected
with &s;uch a Grief for his Sin, as may
be &s;ufficient for Pardon; yet when he has
rightly confe&s;s'd to a Prie&s;t, all his Sins are
pardon'd; and by the Power of the Pope's
Keys, an Ab&s;olution and Entrance is open'd
into Heaven.&endq;</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. That bare repeating or &s;aying over the Prayers
without minding, or &s;o much as knowing what
they &s;ay, is &s;ufficient and acceptable to God.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. Many of their Saints are canoniz'd for dete|&s;table
Villanies, Trea&s;on, and Blood, and yet
they pray to them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>9. That they pretend only to u&s;e Images as Helps
to Devotion; but on the contrary, they
actually pray to them to pardon their Sins.</ITEM>
<ITEM>10. They pray to a Crucifix, as well as to Chri&s;t
him&s;elf, and attribute as much Satisfaction to
it, as to the Blood of their Redeemer.</ITEM>

<PB N="224" REF="238">
<HEAD>DIALOGUE VII.</HEAD>
<P>THE Brother had now run his Length: he
had been a ha&s;ty Convert to Popery; and, as
&s;uch often are, was become a mighty Bigot, eaten
up with Super&s;tition and Ceremony, and, which was
&s;till wor&s;e, tho' he was not in Orders, took upon
him to be a kind of a Mi&s;&s;ionary, for the Conver|&s;ion
of his Friends, preaching Popery to them
where-ever he came.</P>
<P>This Zeal carry'd him even to Indecencies in his
Father's Family; As to his Father him&s;elf, he treat|ed
him with a kind of Di&s;tinction, as he was a Fa|ther;
and, indeed, becau&s;e his Father was a Man
of Spirit, as well as Sen&s;e, who kept him at a due
Di&s;tance, and would not take any Appearance of
Di&s;re&s;pect at his Hand, without Re&s;entment; main|taining
his ju&s;t Authority in his Family, and either
would be convers'd with as he ought to be, or not
be convers'd with at all.</P>
<P>But in the Family, and among his Brothers and
Si&s;ters, which, as I hinted at the Beginning, were
numerous, he was quite another Man, and therein,
indeed, he did not act like a true Mi&s;&s;ionary, &s;ent
to preach Religion to Infidels; who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s it is,
with all po&s;&s;ible Softne&s;s, Mildne&s;s and good U&s;age,
to in&s;inuate them&s;elves into the Favour and good
Opinion of the People.</P>
<P>But, on the contrary, more like a Crui&s;ado Man,
he be&s;ieg'd them with Power, and a&s;&s;aulted them with
Violence, a&s;&s;um'd an Authority in his Di&s;cour&s;e,
<PB N="225" REF="239">
as being the elder Brother, and as he call'd him&s;elf
Head of the Family, next to his Father, who he
treated among them with Slight and an Indifference
bordering upon Contempt.</P>
<P>In this Quality, he pretended to expect his
Words &s;hould come with the greater Force, and ex|pected
Things &s;hould be taken as Truth, upon the
Sanction of his Authority; and being impatient of
Contradiction, would fly out into a Pa&s;&s;ion, if what
he &s;aid was not receiv'd with Re&s;pect; and thus
he frequently took upon him to be angry, and
talk impertinently to his elde&s;t Si&s;ter, and even to
correct, his little Brother for being &s;aucy to him, as
he call'd it, and telling him he pray'd to St. No|body;
and at another Time, his younger Si&s;ter
telling him, a little too pertly, that he pray'd to
the <HI>Devil,</HI> he &s;ent her away crying, and &s;pit in
her Face.</P>
<P>But the Father was too many for him; for tho'
he knew that his Son came frequently among them,
and that he always lay at them to pervert them,
if po&s;&s;ible, and infu&s;e corrupt Principles into their
Minds; yet tru&s;ting to the Grace and Goodne&s;s of
God, and the early Influence which all his little
Hou&s;hold had receiv'd, he would not forbid their
conver&s;ing with him, or re&s;train his coming to
them.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame Time he fail'd not every Day to
fortify their Minds again&s;t Error, by &s;olid Argu|ments,
&s;ound Rea&s;onings, and practical Inferences,
all back'd and &s;upported by Scripture Authority,
laying &s;uch &s;olid Foundations of Truth and Reli|gion,
as all his Sophi&s;try, no nor all the Subtlety
of the Prie&s;t, which he frequently brought with
him, could never &s;hake; and yet this he did, in &s;o
&s;uitable a Manner, with &s;uch agreeable plea&s;ing
Di&s;cour&s;es, and diverting Stories, proportion'd to
the Under&s;tandings of his Children, and to their
<PB N="226" REF="240">
Youth, that in &s;hort, made them not only able to di&s;|pute
with their Brother, but to run him down, and
even make a Je&s;t of him, and of his Religion too.</P>
<P>His elde&s;t Si&s;ter, who his Father chiefly directed
his Di&s;cour&s;es to, was a young Lady of a great
deal of Vivacity, had a &s;prightly Wit, a good
Judgment above her Years, and a capacious va&s;t
Memory, &s;o that nothing was lo&s;t that her Father
&s;aid to her, nor did it want any of the Spirit and
Force, which the Father expre&s;s'd it with. On the
contrary, &s;he rather whetted and &s;harpen'd the
Edge of it, by the ready Turns of her own Saty|rical
Wit, and was often evidently too hard for
him in Argument, as well from the Goodne&s;s of
the Rea&s;oning it&s;elf, which was from her Father, as
from the particular Art &s;he had of placing every
Thing right in her Di&s;cour&s;e, and pu&s;hing him
home where &s;he had the Advantage; and this was the
Rea&s;on that he was &s;o frequently angry, and once in a
Pa&s;&s;ion, he told her, &s;he was di&s;obliging, and did not
treat him as became her, and the like; an evident
Token of his being exhau&s;ted in Argument.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Two or Three Di&s;cour&s;es they had, &s;uch
as that about praying to Saints, to Images, and
adoring Reliques of Saints, adoring the Cro&s;s,
and even Pieces of Wood, which they had Rea|&s;on
to believe was not the true Cro&s;s, and praying
to Crucifixes, and to the Figure of the Cro&s;s where|ever
they met with it; had made him very angry:
but when his Si&s;ter came to the Point of their buy|ing
and &s;elling of Pardons and Indulgences, and
e&s;pecially that of the Pope giving Pardons for Sins
before they were committed, and for Thou&s;ands
of Years to come, &s;eemed to &s;hock him a little,
and once or twice he &s;tood &s;ilent, &s;hook his Head,
and then turned his Di&s;cour&s;e to &s;omething el&s;e,
&s;o that all his Si&s;ters took Notice of it, and remem|ber'd
it afterwards, as we &s;hall hear.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="241">
But we mu&s;t bring this new Convert a little far|ther
on, where we &s;hall &s;ee him acting another Part,
at lea&s;t &s;omething more Rational.</P>
<P>As the Father of this Family had thus, I &s;ay, for|tify'd
his Children, and e&s;pecially his Daughter,
with Arguments, in an&s;wer to all the Points which
he knew their Brother and his Prie&s;t would make
u&s;e of, to deceive and impo&s;e upon them; he
made them really an Over-match for their Brother,
and he could argue upon no Point of Religion, and
e&s;pecially in his Popi&s;h way, but they were mani|fe&s;tly
too hard for him.</P>
<P>Of all the Popi&s;h Tenets, which he defended,
they pre&s;s'd him harde&s;t with tho&s;e Two:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Praying to Saints immediately, and in their
own Per&s;ons, to &s;ave and deliver them;
whereas, he affirm'd, they only pray'd to
them to intercede with Chri&s;t for them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Buying and &s;elling Pardons, and that for
Sins before they were committed, and for
many Years to come.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>He was not able to defend either of the&s;e Points,
and he was a Man of too much Sen&s;e not to know it,
and therefore, as much as he could, he &s;hunn'd med|dling
with them; but his Si&s;ter, &s;harp as Satyr it|&s;elf,
and keen and cutting in her Repartees, hung
upon them, and when he had gone off to &s;ome
other Di&s;cour&s;e, would je&s;t with him, call him back,
and &s;ay, Brother! Brother! keep to the Point;
and particularly &s;he held him &s;o hard to it, about
praying to Saints, in their own Names, (as above)
that he grew angry, and, in his Pa&s;&s;ion, told her
&s;he <HI>Lyed.</HI></P>
<P>The young Lady, with admirable Spirit, keeping
her Temper, though it rais'd &s;ome Blood in her
Face, &s;uffer'd it to rai&s;e none in her Di&s;cour&s;e;
<PB N="228" REF="242">
but &s;he ri&s;es up, and, with Smiles in her Face,
made him a Curt'&s;ey; &startq;I'm an&s;wer'd, Brother,
&s;ays &s;he; I thank GOD you are conquered, you
have no more to &s;ay; for giving the Lye is the
End of all Di&s;cour&s;e.&endq; And with that &s;he walked
gently and calmly out of the Room.</P>
<P>The Gentleman, who he call'd Doctor, and who
they &s;uppos'd to be the Prie&s;t, was with him, as he
generally was, and he greatly blam'd him, and fol|low'd
the young Lady out, intending to per&s;uade
her to come back; but &s;he was gone up into her
Chamber, where, tho' &s;he had govern'd her Tem|per
&s;o well before, &s;he could not refrain giving &s;ome
Vent to her Pa&s;&s;ions, and cry'd heartily for &s;ome
Time.</P>
<P>However, to be even with her Brother, the next
Time he came, and began to di&s;cour&s;e of Reli|gion,
&s;he told him calmly, that &s;he could not but
remember how they left off la&s;t, and that &s;he
would have no more Popery talk'd of, till tho&s;e two
Points were gone thro'.</P>
<P>Her Brother was milder than before, and told
her, he did not de&s;ign to have been &s;o plain with
her; but that &s;he took upon her to affirm Things,
which &s;he could not prove.</P>
<P>She expected he was going to ask her Pardon,
for giving her the Lye; but being di&s;appointed in
that, &s;he began to be a little warm her&s;elf, and told
him, &s;he would not give him &s;uch Language, but
that he &s;hould &s;ee pre&s;ently, whether he de&s;erv'd it
or no; and with that &s;he pulls out the Paper, which
her Father had given her, with the Prayer to St.
<HI>Ann,</HI> which, &s;he &s;aid, was Bla&s;phemous, and bid
him get off of it if he could.</P>
<P>He colour'd and blu&s;h'd, as red as Fle&s;h and Blood
could look, all the while he read it, and, at la&s;t,
throws it away in a Pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;aid it was a fal&s;e
Thing, and that it was a Heretick Forgery.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="243">
No, no, Brother, &s;ays &s;he, the Prote&s;tants &s;tand
in need of no Forgeries, to confound Popery, 'tis
done out of your own Mouths, and with that &s;he
pull'd out the Certificate of the <HI>Sorbonne</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI>
and &s;hew'd it him, both in <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>Then &s;he pull'd out more Papers, and particular|ly
that which is mention'd above, to St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI>
to give good Weather, and take away the Plague;
and with the re&s;t, &s;he had the Documents of the
Pope's Bull, for granting Ten Hundred Thou&s;and
Years of Pardon, mentioned before, and &s;he told
him, &s;he had them to &s;hew.</P>
<P>But he was &s;o confounded with the Certificate of
the <HI>Sorbonne,</HI> in Favour of that bla&s;phemous Prayer
to St. <HI>Ann,</HI> that he &s;aid not one Word, but give
the Paper to the Doctor, who al&s;o read it, and laid
it down without &s;aying any thing to it.</P>
<P>The Doctor was a Man of Temper, and had a
perfect Command of him&s;elf; and &s;eeing the young
Gentleman &s;o confounded and &s;ilent, he endeavoured
to put an End to the Di&s;cour&s;es; and turning to the
young Lady, told her, He was &s;orry to &s;ee the&s;e

broke in upon their Kindne&s;s: That he wi&s;h'd they
would rather conver&s;e upon &s;ome other Subject,

were bound to defend their Principles, and thank'd
GOD they were able to do it; That her Brother had

Side the Fal&s;hood lay, and who had &s;poken Truth,
him&s;elf or his Si&s;ter; That now &s;he was &s;atisfied, and
if her Brother thought fit, &s;he would advi&s;e him to
leave off talking of Religion, till he could defend it
better, and not be baffled by Children.</P>
<P>Her Brother was going to an&s;wer, but the Doctor
&s;eeing him mov'd, and fearing that he would be
rude to his Si&s;ter, &s;tood up, and &s;poke in <HI>Italian</HI> to
him, and begg'd him to &s;ay nothing at that Time,
and &s;o per&s;uaded him to go away: &s;o the Conver&s;a|tion
entirely broke up, and it was the la&s;t they had up|on
the&s;e Subjects; nor did he come near the Family
after it for a Month, 'till other Particulars brought
them to conver&s;e upon better Terms.</P>
<P>Some Time after this, the Brother, by &s;ome Ac|cident,
I do not remember the Particulars, had the
Misfortune to break his Leg; and though it was &s;et
again immediately, yet, he lay a long while, not only
lame, but in great Danger of a Mortification.</P>
<P>During his long Confinement, his Si&s;ter, laying
a&s;ide all the Re&s;entment that had been between 'em,
went to vi&s;it him. The fir&s;t Time &s;he came, and
being in the beginning of his Illne&s;s, he could &s;ay
little to her, nor had &s;he any Room to &s;ay any thing
to him, his Fever being very high; for the Hurt be|ing
what the Surgeons call a Compound Fracture,
that is, where the broken Bone had thru&s;t it&s;elf out
through the Fle&s;h, the Pain of it had thrown him
into a Fever.</P>
<P>However, he &s;poke to her, and de&s;ired her to
come nearer; and putting out his Hand to her, &s;he
gave him her Hand, and he holding it fa&s;t, ask'd
her Pardon for his Pa&s;&s;ion, and ill-u&s;ing her; adding
&s;ome Expre&s;&s;ions that &s;eem'd to let her know,
he had had Lei&s;ure to think a little better of tho&s;e
Things, &s;ince &s;he &s;aw him la&s;t.</P>
<P>What he &s;aid was &s;o moving, tho' but in few
Words, that, together with the dangerous Condition
<PB N="231" REF="245">
&s;he thought he was in, it threw her into Tears, and
&s;he could give him very little An&s;wer, and he per|ceived
it, &s;o he &s;aid no more, and &s;he came away
for that Time. But when &s;he came home, and as
&s;oon as &s;he could get an Opportunity to &s;ee her Fa|ther,
&s;he told him where &s;he had been; upon which,
they had the following &s;hort Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>

bring the <HI>Devil;</HI> I &s;hould know what I had to do
<PB N="233" REF="247">
when he came, but I can't imagine what can be

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pr'ythee, Child, what Things are they?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, fir&s;t, Sir, he has got a Popi&s;h
Nur&s;e, who fits up with him, and &s;he has pinn'd up
I know not how many Holy Reliques, as &s;he calls
them, about the Curtains; and upon the Table,
there is a little Silver Box, which is full of them.</P>
</SP>
<P>The old Woman &s;its by the Bed's-&s;ide in a great
Chair, and there hang Two or Three Strings of
Beads; and at the Back of the Chair, &s;he has pinn'd
up I know not how many Cro&s;&s;es; they are only Bits
of red Tape and black Tape, I &s;uppo&s;e they are to
keep the <HI>Devil</HI> off her dear Self, when &s;he &s;its
down.</P>
<P>Over the Chair, by the Bed-&s;ide, hangs a large
Picture of the Crucifixion; and a great Crucifix of
Wood, or Ivory gilded, hangs again&s;t the Bed's|head,
ju&s;t over him, and another at the Bed's|feet.</P>
<P>But while I was there, he bad them take it away;
Let me have Chri&s;t, &s;ays he aloud, without the
Cro&s;s, Chri&s;t without the Cro&s;s, repeating it aloud;
and, I thought, with &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ion: I am per&s;uaded,
Sir, he is &s;ick of Popery.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how can that be, when he has all this
Trumpery about him?</P>
</SP>

<P>He does not &s;ee them, Sir, only the Cru|cifix,
and he could bear it no longer.</P>

<SP>

<P>Was not his Doctor with him, Child, that
u&s;ed to be his Companion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, and I believe has not; for I
heard the old Woman whi&s;pering to the Maid, who
is a Popi&s;h Wench too, that her Ma&s;ter had quar|relled
with his Confe&s;&s;or, and &s;he was afraid he
would die without being confe&s;s'd, and bad her &s;end
for Father (Somebody) I could not hear his
Name.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="234" REF="248">
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, do they believe he will die?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe they do, Sir, but I mu&s;t &s;ay,
I hope they are mi&s;taken; if the Surgeons are but
Men of Skill, I hope, his Fever will go off again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>

my Mind plainly, as I think is my Duty.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>If he de&s;ires to &s;ee you, Sir, I hope you
will go.</P>

<P>Yes, if he will rid the Place of all his Po|pery.</P>

would have me &s;ay &s;o, Sir, I will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would not have you &s;ay any Thing to trou|ble

if he does not &s;peak of my coming, or de&s;ire me to
come, you need not mention it; but if he does,
you will have fair Occa&s;ion.</P>
</SP>
<P>To make this Part &s;hort; &s;he went Two or Three
Days after that, to &s;ee him again; but he was &s;o
ill, and the Surgeons were about him &s;o, that &s;he
could not &s;ee him. &s;he &s;tay'd &s;ome Time; but the
Surgeons de&s;ired that No-body &s;hould &s;ee him,
e&s;pecially not to talk to him, but that he &s;hould go to
&s;leep, if po&s;&s;ible, to compo&s;e him; for they greatly
feared a Mortification.</P>
<P>His Si&s;ter was &s;urprized a little, to find that he
had changed his Nur&s;e, and that the Popi&s;h Maid-Servant
al&s;o, was gone all of a &s;udden; and the new
Nur&s;e (who, &s;he &s;poke to, it &s;eems) took particu|lar
Care to let her under&s;tand, that &s;he was a Pro|te&s;tant,
which his Si&s;ter was very glad of.</P>
<P>The next Morning, her Brother being told &s;he
had been there the Night before, &s;ent his Servant
to tell his Si&s;ter, he had re&s;ted pretty well that Night
<PB N="235" REF="249">
after the Dre&s;&s;ing; and that he would be glad to &s;ee
her, excu&s;ing his not &s;eeing her over Night.</P>
<P>This over Civility to his Si&s;ter, join'd with her
Ob&s;ervation of the Popi&s;h Nur&s;e being gone, made
her begin to think &s;omething extraordinary was the
Matter; and her Curio&s;ity was increa&s;ed by &s;ome
Words which the Me&s;&s;enger added to one of her
Servants in the Hou&s;e (<HI>viz.</HI>) That there were
&s;trange Alterations at their Hou&s;e; &s;o &s;he ha&s;tened
away.</P>
<P>When &s;he came thither, &s;he found her Brother
much better than &s;he expected; his Pain was much
le&s;s &s;ince the opening of his Leg, and his Fever was
abated, tho' not quite gone; but, however, it was
gone out of his Head, and he was al&s;o much more
chearful than before.</P>
<P>When &s;he ask'd him how he did, he told her, He
was quite well; as well as ever he was in his Life,
and better too.</P>
<P>She was a little frighted at that; and feeling by his
Pul&s;e, that he was &s;till hot, and in a Fever, &s;he
concluded he talk'd light-headed, and that he was
in a wor&s;e Condition than before; upon which, &s;he
could not refrain Tears.</P>
<P>He perceived her Tears, but did not gue&s;s at the
Occa&s;ion; and continuing to &s;peak chearfully to her,
he wondred, a little, that &s;he did not &s;eem plea&s;ed;
and he &s;aid, What's the Matter, Si&s;ter, are you not
plea&s;ed to find me better?</P>
<P>Dear Brother, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> How can you ask me &s;uch
a Que&s;tion? If I was &s;ure you was better, I &s;hould
rejoyce.</P>
<P>How do you mean? Don't you think then that I
am better? Why, fir&s;t of all, I am ea&s;y; the Sur|geons
have loo&s;en'd the Bandage upon my Leg,
which made it &s;well and inflame, and put me to a
continued Torture, and now I am ea&s;y; and then
<PB N="236" REF="250">
he gave her an Account of what they had done,
and how much Danger he was in before.</P>
<P>This Di&s;cour&s;e was &s;o &s;edate and &s;o di&s;tinct, that
&s;he begun to be &s;atisfied; and having &s;aid &s;omething,
by which he perceived what had alarm'd her before,
he pull'd her to him, and ki&s;s'd her, and &s;aid, Dear
Si&s;ter, I am not light-headed, or delirious; and I
&s;hall &s;oon convince you of that, <HI>adds he:</HI> Do you
&s;ee no Alteration in the Hou&s;e?</P>
<P>Yes, &s;ays &s;he, I perceive you have parted with
your old Nur&s;e that you had, when I was here
before.</P>
<P>Ay, Si&s;ter, and with all her Trinkets: Dear Si|&s;ter,
adds he, &s;he is gone, and a wor&s;e Attendant
with her; I have pack'd her off, and all my Popery
along with her; ble&s;&s;ed be God, they are all gone,
I have done with them.</P>
<P>His Si&s;ter was going to an&s;wer, but was &s;o &s;ur|priz'd,
&s;he could not &s;peak; only, that &s;he &s;aid,
<HI>Have you?</HI> And bur&s;t out into Tears, much more
violently by the Force of her Joy, than &s;he had
done before for Grief.</P>
<P>But her Brother &s;eeing it, ki&s;s'd her again, and
holding her by the Hand, went on: Dear Si&s;ter,
&s;aid he, don't weep; now I am &s;ure your Tears are
of another Kind than they were before; I am not
light-headed, I knew what I &s;aid, when I told you I
was well; I am well! I am better than ever I was in
my Life! for tho' my Leg is broken, and my Fever
is &s;trong, my Heart is turn'd; God has open'd my
Eyes, Si&s;ter.</P>
<P>She could not &s;peak a Word yet; her Tears and
her &s;ecret Joy choak'd her Words, and &s;he made good
that Ver&s;e of the Poet,</P>
<P>That &s;udden Joys, like Griefs, confound at fir&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="251">
Look about you, Si&s;ter, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I ask'd you, if
you perceived no Alteration in the Hou&s;e? Don't
you &s;ee all the Popi&s;h Trade is walk'd off? They are
gone, Si&s;ter, with all their Trinkets; ble&s;&s;ed be
God, I have parted with the Idols, and with the
Idolatry too.</P>
<P>Upon this, &s;he turned her &s;elf a little, and began
to look about her; and &s;he pre&s;ently found, that
the Crucifix was gone from the Bed's-head; the
great Picture that hung over the Chair, was taken
down, and all the Reliques that hung about the
Curtains, were gone.</P>
<P>By this time, &s;he recover'd her Speech a little;
and the Nur&s;e came and gave her a Gla&s;s of Wine
and Water, which &s;he call'd for, and when &s;he had
drank it, her Brother &s;aid,</P>
<P><HI>Dear Si&s;ter,</HI> You have been a kind In&s;tructor to
me, tho' I have us'd you very ill for it; but live or
die, I will acknowledge it to you.</P>
<P><HI>Dear Brother,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, I am &s;o &s;urpriz'd with Joy,
with all you &s;ay, that I hardly know whether I am
awake, or whether it is all a Vi&s;ion, a Delu&s;ion, and
whether I am not light-headed, as I thought you
were. I am not able to tell you how it affects me;
but, in a Word, I rejoice beyond expre&s;&s;ing, I de|&s;ire
to be thankful for you.</P>
<P>Ay, &s;ays he, let us all be thankful; it's no Vi&s;ion,
Si&s;ter, nor Delu&s;ion; no, no, I have done with
Delu&s;ion, and the Deluders are fled, they are gone
together; the Night, the Darkne&s;s is fled, and the
Light has &s;hin'd into my Soul: Dear Si&s;ter, 'tis all
owing, next to God's Goodne&s;s, to you, and your
kind affectionate Di&s;cour&s;es.</P>
<P>He talk'd &s;o much, and with &s;uch Vehemence,
that it began to weaken him; and the new Nur&s;e,
that now tended him, a good elderly grave Woman,
and a good Chri&s;tian and Prote&s;tant, de&s;ir'd him
not to talk &s;o much, and &s;o warmly: And his Si&s;ter
<PB N="238" REF="252">
added, Come Brother, &s;ays &s;he, tho' I long to hear
the full Hi&s;tory of it, yet I'll wait till another
Time.</P>
<P>Well, &s;ays he, I mu&s;t have done for the pre&s;ent;
&s;o he bid the Nur&s;e give his Si&s;ter an Account of
Things: And, fir&s;t, &s;he &s;hewed her the Elbow Chair,
where all the Cro&s;&s;es had been pinn'd up, and they
were all gone; the Silver Box of Reliques al&s;o, was
gone, and the &s;everal Popi&s;h Pictures were all
gone. Three Popi&s;h Books, a P&s;alter, call'd
<HI>the Virgin</HI> Mary's <HI>P&s;alter;</HI> another, call'd, <HI>The Hours
of the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin,</HI> and a Ma&s;s-Book, he had made
them be thrown in the Fire before his Face, and
there lay &s;ome of the Remains of 'em half burnt.</P>
<P>While they were doing this, her Brother, a little
&s;pent with Talking, fell fa&s;t a&s;leep; and &s;he took the
Opportunity to ask the Nur&s;e, how all this happen'd.</P>
<P>Why, Madam, &s;ays Nur&s;e, my Ma&s;ter was &s;o
very ill, and the Pain in his Leg was &s;o great, that
every Body thought he would have died; but that
which was wor&s;e, it was plain to us all, for I was in
the Hou&s;e, &s;aid &s;he, that he was more violently
agitated in his Mind, and in greater Agonies there,
than with all the other Pains he endured.</P>
<P>That old Sorcere&s;s, <HI>&s;aid Nur&s;e, I can call her $$le&s;s,</HI>
mumbled over her <HI>Latin</HI> Prayers by him, made
Cro&s;&s;es upon him, and held up her little Crucifix $word$
him; but he thru&s;t it from him, and bad away with
her Tra&s;h, that would do him no good; at which,
&s;he was very angry. She had hung all the Curtain&punc;
with little Bits of Wood, and Bone, and Ivory, and
&s;uch Trumpery, as &s;he call'd Holy; but he knew
nothing of that.</P>
<P>Why, <HI>&s;ays the Si&s;ter,</HI> he might &s;ee them.
If he did, <HI>&s;ays Nur&s;e,</HI> he did not mind 'em.
How came he to &s;ee them at la&s;t, <HI>&s;ays his Si&s;ter?</HI>
Why, Madam, &s;ays &s;he, my Ma&s;ter grew wor&s;e
and wor&s;e, and the old Witch had &s;at up with him
<PB N="239" REF="253">
Two Nights; all which Time, &s;he had worry'd and
teiz'd him to &s;end for his Confe&s;&s;or, and to have
the <HI>Extreme Unction:</HI> &s;he call'd it by another Name
of her own, I don't know what; but he would not
hear of it, and told her he was not in &s;uch Danger.</P>
<P>But, at la&s;t, &s;he teiz'd him &s;o much, that it made
him angry; and he told her, ha&s;tily, he would have
none of it, 'twould do him no good, or 'twas
good for nothing to him, or to that Purpo&s;e; &s;o &s;he
left off, but was highly provok'd; and the next
Morning &s;he had &s;ent for a Prie&s;t without his
Knowledge.</P>
<P>When the Prie&s;t came into the Room, he was in
a great Pa&s;&s;ion at the Sight of him; and, Madam,
&s;ays Nur&s;e, tho&s;e Things did my Ma&s;ter a great deal
of Harm, and made him wor&s;e than he would be;
however, he govern'd his Pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;poke civilly
to the Prie&s;t, and told him, He could not, at that
Time, di&s;cour&s;e; that he was in Pain, but, he hop'd it
would abate, when they opened his Leg, and that he
was ju&s;t endeavouring to go to Re&s;t; but that, when
he was a little refre&s;h'd, and able to &s;ee him, he
would &s;end for him; and with this, he di&s;mi&s;s'd the
old Prie&s;t, and he went quietly away, only gave him
his Popi&s;h Ble&s;&s;ing as he went.</P>
<P>Then he did not &s;ay over any of his Mumbles to
him, did he? <HI>&s;ays the Si&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>No, Madam, <HI>&s;ays Nur&s;e,</HI> it was plain, my Ma&s;ter
did not care for them.</P>
<P>But, <HI>&s;ays the Si&s;ter,</HI> What did the old Woman
&s;ay?</P>
<P>Why, Madam, <HI>&s;ays Nur&s;e,</HI> &s;he did not perceive
my Ma&s;ter's Meaning then; &s;o &s;he took no Notice
of it; and &s;he having &s;ate up Two Nights together,
I was order'd to &s;it up the next Night, and the old
Witch went to Bed.</P>
<P>When I came to &s;it up, Madam, my Ma&s;ter call'd
me to the Bed-&s;ide, Who are you? <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> for it
<PB N="240" REF="254">
was pretty dark by the Bed-&s;ide, having only a
Watch-Light, and that at a Di&s;tance; &s;o I &s;aid, <HI>'Tis
I,</HI> Sir, <HI>do not you know me?</HI> With that he called
me by my Name; Is it you? &s;ays he, I am glad to
have you &s;it up with me, I want to &s;peak with
you.</P>
<P>And then, Madam, &s;aid &s;he, my Ma&s;ter &s;ur|priz'd
me; I knew how he had been &s;educed and
drawn away by the Prie&s;ts beyond Sea, and had been
prevail'd with to turn Papi&s;t, and there was &s;uch a
deal of &s;uper&s;titious Stuff among them here, e&s;peci|ally
the Old Woman, that I could hardly bear the
Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>But my Ma&s;ter &s;oon &s;hewed me that he was an|other
Man; told me he found Popery was a gay
Thing Abroad, and 'twas a mighty ea&s;y Way of
going on through Life, but there was nothing in it
to go through Death; it was no Religion to die
with; that it was a &s;ad Thing to return too late, and
&s;o near Death, but that he had been &s;ick of it now
two Days, and the Old Woman, &s;ays he, has &s;hew'd
me as much the Folly of it all, as any of them.</P>
<P>But has he had no Prie&s;t with him, &s;aid his
Si&s;ter?</P>
<P>Yes, Madam, &s;ays Nur&s;e; there the Light began
to &s;hine in upon him; the Prie&s;t and he fell out;
the Prie&s;t, it &s;eems, urg'd him to confe&s;s him&s;elf, as
they call it; he told him he had: The Old Woman
an&s;wered, Has! to who, I wonder? here has been
no Confe&s;&s;or with him.</P>
<P>He an&s;wered with &s;ome Anger, he &s;hould con|fe&s;s
him&s;elf no more.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>&s;ays the Prie&s;t,</HI> no Confe&s;&s;ion no Ab&s;o|lution.</P>
<P>I know it very well, <HI>&s;ays my Ma&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>However, what with the Prie&s;t, and the Old
Woman together, they made him very warm, and, as
ill as he was, he told them aloud, God alone could ab|&s;olve
<PB N="241" REF="255">
him, and he would confe&s;s him&s;elf to him
alone.</P>
<P>The Woman, though his Servant, was &s;aucy and
in&s;olent; the Prie&s;t indeed u&s;ed him better, that is,
with more Manners, but pre&s;&s;ed him earne&s;tly to
Confe&s;&s;ion, telling him that tho' God alone could
pardon, he had given Power to his Servants, for
the Comfort of the Penitent, to pronounce them
ab&s;olv'd in the Name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, provided they
made a full Confe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>He in&s;i&s;ted he would make no other Confe&s;&s;ion
for the pre&s;ent, and &s;o the Prie&s;t mode&s;tly enough
withdrew; but, adds Nur&s;e, the Old Woman has
&s;o teiz'd him Night and Day, that &s;he really has
not given him Time to re&s;t when he might have
re&s;ted; and, in a Word, has talked &s;o fooli&s;hly
too, that he has &s;een farther into the Emptine&s;s of
Popery, by her Means, than ever he did before.</P>
<P><HI>&s;ays the Si&s;ter,</HI> That is but a poor Light, to &s;ee into
Popery by Fools, and makes but few Converts.</P>
<P>No, Madam, <HI>&s;ays Nur&s;e,</HI> but Popery is a Reli|gion
for Fools, and my Ma&s;ter &s;aw by it how the
Ignorance of the People was the Support of Po|pery.</P>
<P>He knew all that before, <HI>&s;ays his Si&s;ter,</HI> and u&s;ed
to tell me there was no Need that the common
People &s;hould know any thing; 'twas enough for
them that the Prie&s;t under&s;tood how to pray for
them; that they were only to repeat the Words
in <HI>Latin,</HI> and believe they were &s;uch Prayers as they
ought to &s;ay, and that God would accept the Devo|tion
without the Words.</P>
<P>Well, Madam, but my Ma&s;ter is of another Mind
now, I a&s;&s;ure you; and he gave me a long Account
how he was drawn in; but that which I heeded
mo&s;t, was how he was brought out of it all again,
which he &s;aid was occa&s;ion'd by &s;ome Things you
<PB N="242" REF="256">
&s;aid to him and &s;hew'd him, about praying to Saint
<HI>Ann,</HI> and about the Pope's &s;elling of Pardons.</P>
<P>I remember the Pa&s;&s;age, <HI>&s;aid his Si&s;ter;</HI> but that
was a good while ago.</P>
<P>Let it be when it will, Madam, <HI>&s;ays Nur&s;e,</HI> that
gave the fir&s;t Blow to it all.</P>
<P>Well, but, <HI>&s;ays the Si&s;ter,</HI> pray go on with what
he told you that Night.</P>
<P>Why, Madam, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> he complain'd heavily
of the Old Woman dunning him to confe&s;s him&s;elf,
till at la&s;t, &s;ays he, I bid the old Fool be quiet, and
let me go to &s;leep; after which, added he, &s;he &s;at
rattling her Beads, and &s;aying <HI>Latin</HI> Prayers &s;o
loud, that tho' &s;he thought I was a&s;leep, I heard her
all the while.</P>
<P>After this, Madam, I took the Freedom to &s;ay to
my Ma&s;ter, Sir, pray, &s;eeing your Eyes are now, ble&s;&s;ed
be God, opened, and you are convinc'd of the Wick|edne&s;s
of all the&s;e Things, why do you let all the&s;e
Trinkets hang about you?</P>
<P>About me, what do you mean? <HI>&s;ays he.</HI></P>
<P>Why, Sir, &s;aid I, about your Bed, and the Cur|tains,
and almo&s;t every where.</P>
<P>I know nothing of them, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> &s;hew me &s;ome
of them.</P>
<P>So I took down two or three little dirty Bits of
Bone and Wood, and &s;hew'd them to him; <HI>Here,
Sir, &s;aid I,</HI> what are they, I be&s;eech you? I be|lieve
they are Charms, or Spells, or &s;ome &s;uch
Things; I believe &s;he is a Witch.</P>
<P>O! &s;ays he, I &s;ee, the&s;e are holy Relicks to keep
evil Spirits away.</P>
<P>I be&s;eech you, Sir, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> pray to God to keep
you from the evil Spirit, and do not deal in &s;uch
Things as the&s;e; I am afraid to touch them.</P>
<P>Take them all down, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> and do not be afraid
of them; the <HI>Devil</HI> can do nothing with them, any
more than without them.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="257">
So I took them all down, but when I came to
the Ea&s;y-Chair I was frighted; Sir, &s;ays I, pray
what is the Matter with this poor Chair?</P>
<P>Why, what ails it? <HI>&s;ays he.</HI></P>
<P>Nay, Sir, &s;ays I, 'tis all Witchcraft; why, here is
a Hundred Cro&s;&s;es upon it, they hang all over it; I
dare not &s;it in it.</P>
<P>Do not be afraid, <HI>&s;ays my Ma&s;ter,</HI> take them all
away.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, Madam, I clear'd the Room of all the
Popery, and all the Popi&s;h Pictures, by my Ma&s;ter's
particular Order, and carry'd them all into the Old
Woman's Room, where &s;he was fa&s;t a&s;leep; and
then my Ma&s;ter, tho' he was &s;pent with talking, &s;aid,
his Mind was ea&s;y, and he would go to &s;leep; and
&s;o he did, and &s;lept better than he had done in &s;e|veral
Nights for almo&s;t two Hours.</P>
<P>But, &s;ays the Si&s;ter, Pray what &s;aid the Old
Woman to all this?</P>
<P>I will tell you that by and by, <HI>&s;ays Nur&s;e,</HI> but
pray let me go through with the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Do &s;o, <HI>&s;ays the Si&s;ter,</HI> for 'tis a very plea&s;ant Story
to me, I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
<P>Why when my Ma&s;ter wak'd, I ask'd him how he
did? he told me, with &s;ome Warmth; <HI>Better,</HI> Nur&s;e,
<HI>better a great deal;</HI> not that I am in le&s;s Pain, or
that the Fever is abated, but I am better: Now,
<HI>adds he,</HI> if it be the Will of God I can dye, I have
purg'd my Hou&s;e and my Heart from Idols, and I
have been in Heaven all the while I have been
a&s;leep.</P>
<P>He had had &s;ome plea&s;ing Dream about it, I &s;up|po&s;e,
<HI>&s;ays his Si&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>Yes, he had, &s;ays &s;he, and he told me his Dream,
'tis very long, and I cannot remember it all; but
it was that the Devil held him fa&s;t with three great
Chains, till an Angel came from Heaven and de|liver'd
him, and tied the three great Chains fa&s;t about
<PB N="244" REF="258">
the Devil that he &s;hould take hold of him no more,
and then leaving the <HI>Devil</HI> chain'd to the Ground,
took him up, and carry'd him through the Air into
Heaven.</P>
<P>What a &s;trange Dream was this, <HI>&s;ays the Si&s;ter!</HI>
O my Ma&s;ter, Madam, will tell it you all, <HI>&s;ays
&s;he,</HI> there's a deal more of it.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>&s;ays the Si&s;ter,</HI> but what followed?</P>
<P>Why, Madam, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> then he order'd me to
pull out &s;uch a Drawer, and there were three or four
Books in it; he bid me bring them to him, which
I did, and he made me promi&s;e him that as &s;oon as
the Family was up, I would throw them in the Fire
and burn them all; and I faithfully perform'd it,
and brought up the Ruins of them to &s;hew him,
that he might be &s;atisfied; and my Ma&s;ter has
mended in his Health ever &s;ince; and e&s;pecially now
he is ea&s;y in his Leg, I do not doubt but he will be
well again.</P>
<P>Well, Nur&s;e, <HI>&s;aid the Si&s;ter,</HI> but what came of
the Old Woman?</P>
<P>Why, in the Morning, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> my Ma&s;ter or|der'd
me to <HI>pay her</HI> and &s;end her away, with all her
Baggage, and I did &s;o; but &s;he went away cur&s;ing
and raving, and calling me all the Hereticks, and
damn'd poy&s;on'd Hereticks, &s;he could think of; nay,
cur&s;ed my Ma&s;ter, and all the Hou&s;e, before &s;he
went.</P>
<P>But &s;he march'd off, did &s;he not? &s;ays the
Si&s;ter.</P>
<P>Yes, yes, <HI>&s;ays the Nur&s;e,</HI> &s;he went away, and I
hope my Ma&s;ter will be troubled no more with
them.</P>
<P>All this while her Brother &s;lept very found, and
Nur&s;e looking in upon him, told her, &s;he found him
in a &s;weet Sleep, and, as &s;he thought, was in a little
Sweet; &s;o the young Lady told her, &s;he would go
Home, and come again in the Evening.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="259">
My Ma&s;ter will want you, Madam, &s;ays Nur&s;e,
as &s;oon as he wakes.</P>
<P>Nur&s;e, <HI>&s;ays the Si&s;ter,</HI> this News is &s;o &s;urprizing|ly
good, and our whole Family have &s;o much Con|cern
in it, that I cannot bear my Father &s;hould not
hear it; I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, it troubles me he has been
without it &s;o long.</P>
<P>Nay, Madam, <HI>&s;ays Nur&s;e,</HI> that's true, 'tis pity my
old Ma&s;ter &s;hould not hear it; but if my Ma&s;ter
wakes, what &s;hall I &s;ay?</P>
<P>Say, Nur&s;e, <HI>&s;ays the Lady,</HI> &s;ay the Truth, ju&s;t as
I &s;ay it to you; tell him that I am gone home, to let
my Father know a Piece of News, that, I am &s;ure,
will be to him like Life from the Dead; like the Fa|ther
of the Prodigal, in the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>I will leave out the la&s;t, Madam, <HI>&s;ays Nur&s;e,</HI> if
you plea&s;e, perhaps it may trouble him.</P>
<P>Well, do then, <HI>&s;ays the Si&s;ter,</HI> tho' I don't think
'twill trouble him, to tell him how his Father will re|joice
over him.</P>
<P>After this, the Si&s;ter came away, and brought the
News to his Father; but it is not to be expre&s;s'd,
with what Tears of Joy the whole Family received
the News; with what Exta&s;ies of Joy and Thank|fulne&s;s,
his Father received it, who might well &s;ay,
<HI>This my Son was dead, and is alive again; was lo&s;t,
and is found.</HI> The Narrative of this remarkable
Return of a Penitent, is too long for this Work;
it would fill a Book by it&s;elf, and, perhaps, may,
in its Time, in order farther to &s;et out the Delu|&s;ion
of Popery.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent, I clo&s;e this Part, by adding, The
young Gentleman recovered apace; and as &s;oon as
he was well enough to be removed, his Father
caus'd him to be brought home; where he lay ill
&s;everal Months, for tho' his Leg was perfectly well,
<PB N="246" REF="260">
yet it had brought him into a declining State of
Health: But he recover'd at la&s;t thoroughly, conti|nued
a Prote&s;tant, very &s;ober and religious; and the
Father kept the Day of his Re-Conver&s;ion, as a Day
of Thank&s;giving in the Family, as long as he
lived.</P>

<HEAD>DIALOGUE I.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Succe&s;s which the good Gentle|man,
the Father of this well in&s;tructed
Family, I have been &s;peaking of, had
met with, in the Popi&s;h Controver&s;y
with his elde&s;t Son, and the good Ef|fect
it had, both upon his &s;aid Son, and all the
re&s;t of his Children, not only in&s;tructed his Family,
but it gave his Words and Di&s;cour&s;es to them a
greater Force and Energy, upon all &s;uch Occa&s;ions,
than it would otherwi&s;e have had; and had al&s;o this
particular good Effect, <HI>viz.</HI> That his Children al|ways
applyed to him, as to their Oracle, when any
religious Doubt or Di&s;pute appeared upon the Stage,
in their Time.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e Occa&s;ions, he took a particular Me|thod
of his own, which yet, will, I believe, recom|mend
it&s;elf to many other judicious and capable
Per&s;ons, who are Heads of Families; as, perhaps,
<PB N="248" REF="262">
the be&s;t and cleare&s;t Way to enforce their In&s;tructi|ons;
and this was,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. To bring all Things into as &s;hort and conci&s;e
Heads of Di&s;pute as he could, that it might be
the ea&s;ier retain'd in the Memory of his young
Audience.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. He endeavour'd to bring &s;olid and &s;ufficient
Vouchers to prove every Thing that he &s;aid,
confirming his In&s;tructions from ancient and
authentick Authors; &s;uch who&s;e Authority
could not be di&s;puted, much le&s;s deny'd, and
as much as po&s;&s;ible from the Scripture it&s;elf,
as the great Oracle of all Truth, e&s;tabli&s;h'd and
undi&s;puted in it &s;elf.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. He dige&s;ted all in a familiar Way, ea&s;y to be
receiv'd, and to be under&s;tood by the meane&s;t
Capacity.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. He brought as much of it as he could into
Story, that it might be plea&s;ant and diverting,
and con&s;equently be entertain'd by the Enqui|rers
with Plea&s;ure and Delight.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>By this happy Method of Plainne&s;s, and a plea|&s;ant
agreeable Way of Talking, he made his Family
greatly delighted in hearing his In&s;tructions, and
eagerly to receive them; &s;o that they often u&s;ed to
come and ask him Que&s;tions upon &s;uch Heads as they
found di&s;puted in the World, and to de&s;ire his
Opinion.</P>
<P>It was upon a particular Occa&s;ion that his elde&s;t
Daughter, of whom I have &s;aid &s;o much already,
begun thus with him one Day at Dinner.</P>
<P>Sir, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> you u&s;ed to relate &s;omething or
other to us that was improving and diverting too,
<PB N="249" REF="263">
and of the highe&s;t Importance; have you nothing
left in your Thoughts to encrea&s;e our little Stock
of Knowledge?</P>
<P>Truly Child, <HI>&s;ays the Father,</HI> I found &s;uch Diffi|culties
fall in my Way, in our la&s;t Di&s;cour&s;es of this
Kind, that it made me &s;ometimes wi&s;h I had never
begun them: It held me &s;o long, and was &s;o un|happily
thwarted by your Brother, that I &s;ometimes
was ready to fear I &s;hould never get thro' it, and
that I had done more Harm than Good in my
Family.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, your Succe&s;s at la&s;t was enough
to encourage you; Be&s;ides, Sir, What had you to
fear in &s;o good a Cau&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I am no Divine, no Ca&s;ui&s;t, I had not
&s;tudied the Di&s;pute other than as a private Chri&s;tian
had, and as every private Chri&s;tian ought, to fur|ni&s;h
my &s;elf with &s;o much of the Argument, on both
Sides, as &s;atisfied me in the Choice of my own
Principles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I dare &s;ay, you were not afraid my

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank God I did not fear that either your
Brother, or his Prie&s;t, or any other in Conjunction
with them, would have &s;haken my own Principles;
but I did not know how far they might, by their
Sophi&s;try and Cunning, in&s;inuate into your young
Heads. <HI>Popery</HI> propo&s;es a fine ea&s;y Way of &s;liding
into Heaven, as a Man gets into a Prince's Ap|partments,
by bribing a Page of the Pack-&s;tairs;
or into a Nobleman's Hou&s;e, by bribing the Por|ter
or Door-keeper; &s;o that after a Life led
at large, and &s;inning by Licen&s;e, a formal Con|fe&s;&s;ion,
and a bought Ab&s;olution, wipes out all the
Score, and the Offe$der goes on quietly as if he had
never &s;inned at all. I did not know what &s;uch a
Scheme of going to Heaven might do; I know it
has deluded many a well-meaning Chri&s;tian, and car|ried
<PB N="250" REF="264">
them &s;o far out of their Way, that &s;ome have
never found their Way back, and I did not know
what it might do among you.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true, but I was not always &s;o merry
as I made my &s;elf, tho' I think truly 'tis the only

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis a ridiculous Religion indeed; we

I am &s;ure we found it &s;o in the Ca&s;e of my Brother;

Day, and we hope to know the In&s;ide of it here|after
at once, by a full Di&s;covery, at one Glance,
when all Things &s;hall be reveal'd; but we would
be informed &s;omething of the Works of God on this
Side, as well tho&s;e above us, as tho&s;e about us,
which tho' we conver&s;e with every Day, we find
we know little of it.</P>

probably be their End.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, that is, indeed, what we want
to know; my Brother has told us &s;omething of
them; but he is gone now, and has &s;et us on fire
with an eager De&s;ire to know the re&s;t.</P>

I am, can teach you to know all the re&s;t.</P>

<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>The utmo&s;t Perfection of Human Knowledge

of the great Author of Nature, who has made
all tho&s;e glorious Bodies, and directs all their Mo|tions.</P>

<P>This &s;till makes us the more de&s;irous to

are not capable to under&s;tand.</P>

Ta&s;te of the&s;e Things, I hope we &s;hall make &s;uch

<SP>

<P>Yes, there is a Religious as well as a Mathe|matical
Improvement in every Part of it, and they
go on Hand in Hand, running through every Branch

perhaps Years, to go through it.</P>

<P>I am not afraid you &s;hall be weary of it, for
every new Thing you &s;ee and know will inflame

<P>Thus far they were gone in their Di&s;cour&s;e, and
the Father was telling them, by Way of Intro|duction,
that he would prepare him&s;elf again&s;t the
next Day with &s;ome u&s;eful Generals, to give them
as a Scheme of his future Di&s;cour&s;es. 1. That he
would provide a Pair of Globes for them, and
learn them the U&s;e of them, that they might &s;ee
the Motions of the Heavenly Bodies, as he explain'd
it to them. 2. And &s;ome Maps of the &s;everal Parts
of the World, in order to teach them the U&s;e of
them, and how to judge of the Situation, and &s;e|veral
Di&s;po&s;itions, of that Part of the World which
they would hear di&s;cours'd of in Conver&s;ation, that
&s;o when they heard of any of the great Tran&s;actions
of the World, Armies marching, Sieges, Battles,
and the like, they might march along with them in
the Maps, and &s;ee where every thing was doing as
it was done.</P>
<P>He was going on with tho&s;e Things, and they
were mightily delighted with the Expectation of
what they were to learn, when two Gentlemen came
in, who were very intimate in the Family, tho' not
related; one of them was a Mini&s;ter, and the other
<PB N="253" REF="267">
a Gentleman, but of Learning, as well Religious as
Human, equal to the other.</P>
<P>The&s;e falling into Conver&s;ation, with the Gentle|man
of the Hou&s;e, there happened, one Thing
drawing on another, to begin a warm Di&s;cour&s;e
upon the new unhappily reviv'd Di&s;putes, upon the
old <HI>Arian</HI> and <HI>Socinian</HI> Here&s;ies, in which the Mi|ni&s;ter,
and the Gentleman, chiefly concerned them|&s;elves;
the Father, or Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e, very
little intermedling, only now and then interpo&s;ing a
Word or two, and e&s;pecially, as Moderator, when
they began to be warm, and, as he thought, to
break in a little upon Friend&s;hip and Decency.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;ter was perfectly Orthodox in his Prin|ciples,
and &s;trict in the Practice of the Doctrines
which he taught, but in&s;i&s;ted much, in his Di&s;|cour&s;e,
upon the U&s;efulne&s;s of Practical Divinity,
rather than to run into doubtful Di&s;putations.</P>
<P>The Gentleman, as above, was Learned, Bright,
full of Knowledge, and full of Wit; conceiv'd clearly,
and expre&s;s'd his Thoughts aptly and intelligibly,
but was tainted in Principle with the new Errors,
as to the Trinity; and, withal, a little of a Dei&s;t, or
Sceptick, or Free-Thinker, call them what you will,
and when the Divine pre&s;&s;ed for a &s;erious Applica|tion
to the practical Part of Divinity, rather than
the Polemick, began to triumph over him, as if
he was baffled, and afraid to go on, at which the
Mini&s;ter defy'd his Sugge&s;tion, and challeng'd him
fairly to the Di&s;pute.</P>
<P>However they did not go far into it at that Time,
but &s;o far as to draw on a Di&s;cour&s;e between the
Father and his Family, which i&s;&s;ued in re&s;olving,
by Con&s;ent, to adjourn their Philo&s;ophy for a while,
and to de&s;ire their Father to inform them a little how
the Ca&s;e &s;tood with re&s;pect to the many Di&s;putes
that were now in the World about the great Arti|cles
of our Faith.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="268">
His Daughter, who was a Leader of the younger
Children in all their Enquiries, told him &s;he thought
they had been fully in&s;tructed in all the Principle,

in their Catechi&s;m, and by his former In&s;tructions;
but tho&s;e Gentlemen, that call them&s;elves Free.
Thinkers, &s;ays &s;he, are enough to beat us out of all
Principles, and unteach us all we have learn'd.</P>
<P>Why Child, <HI>&s;ays the Father,</HI> what do you meet
with among them that &s;hocks your Principles? what
Books have you been reading?</P>
<P>I have not read many Books, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> but we
meet with it in all our Conver&s;ation; People argue,
I think, again&s;t all the E&s;&s;ential Points of Religion,
and they &s;eem to love it.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is &s;trange they &s;hould argue and di|&s;pute

darken it, and to put out the little Light they have.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is the Effect of a Natural Reluctance,
which People have to what is good: They would be
mighty glad there was neither Heaven, or God, or
Future State; they are very unea&s;y, left the Affir|mative
&s;hould be true, becau&s;e then giving an Ac|count
to them, being judg'd and &s;entenc'd by them,
and in that State too, appears a Con&s;equence; and they
would be very glad there was nothing in that Part,
for many Rea&s;ons too evident to need a Repetition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But they &s;eem now to go upon another
Point, not &s;o openly wicked as that; they tell us, they
acknowledge a God, a Heaven, and Future State,
and all tho&s;e Things, but they have taken away all
the Terrors that &s;tuck &s;o clo&s;e to them upon tho&s;e
Accounts before; and now, upon their new Noti|ons,
they are very ea&s;y, and talk of all tho&s;e Things
as if they were &s;ettled in their Favour.</P>

<PB N="255" REF="269">

<P>Yes, they have e&s;tabli&s;h'd an entire new
Sy&s;tem of Heaven and Hell, God and Devil, all to
their full Satisfaction.</P>
<P>1. They do not, indeed, directly deny a GOD,
but they acknowledge him in &s;uch a Manner,
and bring the Deity, which they pretend to
own, under &s;uch Regulations and Re&s;trictions,
that they &s;carce allow him to be a GOD at all.
They will have him be &s;o good, &s;o merciful,
&s;o beneficent, that he cannot be Ju&s;t; They
take all Re&s;entment from him, let the Wick|edne&s;s
of Man be how great &s;oever: As to
Puni&s;hment, that they will not allow at all, they
tell us, it is not con&s;i&s;tent with the Nature of a
<HI>Deity;</HI> and all tho&s;e Things which we &s;ee ex|ecuted
by the Divine Vengeance in the World,
they call Accident, Temporary, and &s;uch like;
covering THINGS with WORDS, and amu&s;ing
us with being quite wrong, as they call it,
about Hell, and a Future State of Perdition,
which they make a Je&s;t of.</P>

<P>Well, Child, their Meaning is the &s;ame, and
they expre&s;s it much alike; but let them expre&s;s it
as they will, they aim at &s;omething, and it is indeed
too much the Way of tho&s;e People, who wi&s;h to
have Things as they repre&s;ent them; but I hope
this will not go far with you: The <HI>Being of a God</HI>
is an Original Beam of Light &s;hining into the Soul
from the fir&s;t Hour of its being able to judge and
reflect: The whole <HI>Book of Nature</HI> teaches it, and

Impurity and Corruption, without Abhorrence, and

Sinner with <HI>Re&s;entment</HI> and <HI>Di&s;plea&s;ure:</HI> How el&s;e

let it all be trac'd back to the Prophecies of Chri&s;t,

appointed it; and let them tell us whether Heaven
has no Thunders, executes no Judgments, excites
no Power in Vengeance again&s;t his offending Crea|tures:

every Thing unju&s;t, di&s;hone&s;t, di&s;honourable, or

<P>For my Part, I firmly believe the Scrip|tures
are the Word of God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that they are the Revelation of God; a
Revelation from him&s;elf, and of him&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and tho' written, or put into Writing,
by the Pens of Men, yet, that they were dictated and
directed by the immediate In&s;piration of the Spirit
of Truth, which is GOD him&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope, my Dear, I may &s;ay as our Saviour
&s;ays in another Ca&s;e to St. <HI>Peter; Fle&s;h and Blood
hath not revealed this unto thee, but my Father which
is in Heaven,</HI> Matth. xvi. 17.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But now, Sir, the&s;e People go farther,
for after they have brought in Que&s;tion the Ju&s;tice
<PB N="263" REF="277">
of God, they immediately proceed to di&s;robe him of
all his Glory.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very true, they would have a GOD with|out
a Devil, according to <HI>Epicurus;</HI> a God Wi&s;e
and Powerful, but not infinitely &s;o, not Omnipo|tent,
not Self-&s;ufficient, and All-&s;ufficient; a GOD
that having created the World (and 'tis with &s;ome
Difficulty they go &s;o far) has not Power to guide
it, but has abandoned it to the Government
of it &s;elf; to that fooli&s;h <HI>Nothing,</HI> that unexi&s;ting
Piece of Non&s;en&s;e, call'd <HI>Chance;</HI> or like the Fol|lowers
of <HI>Zeno</HI> that Dei&s;t Philo&s;opher, a God depend|ing
upon (they know not what, of a) blind De&s;tiny;
a God who not being able to break the Chain of
&s;econd Cau&s;es, is carry'd away with them him&s;elf,
being obliged to act by the Cour&s;e of natural Con&s;e|quences,
even whether he will or no.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed this is exactly their Way of
Talking.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, the Scripture expo&s;es and confutes all
the&s;e, and that not only by its absolute Divine Au|thority,
but by the convincing Force of its own
unan&s;werable Arguments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is what I would be able to an&s;wer
them with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is in nothing more clear than in this very
Thing, which they oppo&s;e, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the executing Ven|geance
upon ob&s;tinate Sinners, which they would
deny, making his Ju&s;tice cla&s;h with his Nature, <HI>which
is ever to have Mercy and to forgive.</HI></P>
</SP>
<P>Now 'tis evident in the Scriptures, that God not
only executed his terrible Vengeance upon Sinners,
and again&s;t whole Nations of Sinners, but that he
had predicted, threatned, and, as I may &s;ay, pro|mi&s;ed
to execute that Vengeance upon them, many
Years, nay, many Ages before it came to pa&s;s; and
that it has come to pa&s;s at the End of tho&s;e many
Ages, exactly to the Time when it was predicted
<PB N="264" REF="278">
and threaten'd&punc; The Scripture is full of tho&s;e
Predictions, and of $word$ Accompli&s;hment too, and
both ways they confirm their own Divine Authority,
as well as vindicate the Ju&s;tice of God, and &s;hew us
how con&s;i&s;tent it is with his Mercy and Goodne&s;s to
puni&s;h.</P>
<P>1. It confirms the Divine Authority and Original
of the Scripture, for who but GOD him&s;elf could
foretel what God him&s;elf would do? and this too,
&s;o many Years, and Ages of Years, before it came
to Pa&s;s?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Sir, give us &s;ome of tho&s;e Pre|dictions,
I &s;uppo&s;e or gue&s;s at them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Name &s;uch, <HI>my Dear,</HI> as you aim at.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, fir&s;t, the drowning of the World;
I under&s;tand it was revealed to <HI>Noah,</HI> as we find it
in the Scripture 120 Years before its Accompli&s;h|ment,
<HI>Gen.</HI> vi. 17. <HI>Behold I, even I, do bring</HI> a Flood
of Waters <HI>upon the Earth;</HI> and again, God foretels
it to <HI>Noah</HI> ju&s;t a Week before it was to happen,
<HI>Gen.</HI> vii. 4. and accordingly it did happen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is very true, and is very much to this
Purpo&s;e; &s;o al&s;o was the Bondage of the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> in
<HI>Egypt,</HI> and the driving out the <HI>Canaanites,</HI> when their
Iniquity &s;hould be come to its full Height, both
which were fulfilled even to a Day, <HI>the &s;elf-&s;ame Day,</HI>
Exod. xii. 17, 51. tho' predicted above 400 Years
before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Al&s;o the Captivity was foretold, as the Day
of God's Vengeance, many Years; (I think) above
100 Years before it came to pa&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, it was foretold (as a Thing that &s;hould
certainly fall upon them) in the Time of King <HI>He|zekiah,</HI>
I&s;aiah xxxix. 6. and again in the Prophe&s;y
of <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> Cap. xv. 4. and, which is remarkable
in the Ruins of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Nation and Church, 'tis
expre&s;sly &s;aid it was <HI>the Vengeance of God</HI> upon them
for their Sins, 2 <HI>Kings</HI> xxiv. 2, 3, 4. <HI>For the Sins of</HI>
<PB N="265" REF="279">
Mana&s;&s;eh, <HI>at the Commandment of the</HI> LORD <HI>came
this upon</HI> Judah, <HI>and for the</HI> innocent Blood <HI>that he
&s;hed, which the</HI> LORD <HI>would not pardon.</HI></P>
</SP>
<P>So that here you have God glorifying his Ju&s;tice,
and puni&s;hing his People with a terrible Judgment,
and it is expre&s;sly &s;aid to be for their Sins; and yet
the Mercy of God is Infinite &s;till, nor is it any Im|peachment
of his Mercy that he is plea&s;ed to exe|cute
even the Fiercene&s;s of his Anger upon his Ene|mies,
or that he will eternally do &s;o at the la&s;t.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are more Examples in the Scripture,
Sir, but I do not remember them now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That particular threaten'd Judgment, which
I aim'd at in the Beginning, was the De&s;truction
which came upon <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> for their rejecting of
Chri&s;t, which Chri&s;t him&s;elf predicted, and which
came to pa&s;s &s;o &s;oon, and &s;o exactly, according to
his Predictions; for the City and Temple were entire|ly
de&s;troyed within Forty Years after, and that
with &s;uch a general De&s;truction, that it might be
&s;aid of the Temple, as our Saviour predicted, <HI>There
&s;hall not be left here one Stone upon another, that &s;hall
not be thrown down,</HI> Luke xxi. 6.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was an eminent Day of Vengeance
indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and it was all for their Sin, and particu|larly
that Sin, of not <HI>knowing the Things of their Peace,</HI>
in the Day of it, <HI>that is,</HI> for rejecting Chri&s;t, and cru|cifying
the Lord of Life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what are we to conclude from the&s;e
Things, to oppo&s;e the Objectors who cavil thus at
the Scripture?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have two Things to argue from it.</P>
</SP>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That the Scripture is of Divine Original, be|cau&s;e
no Power on Earth could form Predicti|ons
of Divine Truths, which &s;hould exactly
<PB N="266" REF="280">
come to pa&s;s in that Manner, but by the In&s;pi|ration
of a Divine Power.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That it is no Impeachment of the Mercy and
Goodne&s;s of GOD, that he does let loo&s;e his
Vengeance upon ob&s;tinate and impenitent
People.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is very plain indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go back next to the Books of <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> The Pro|phe&s;ies
there are of &s;uch a Nature, the fulfilling of
them &s;o exceeding remote, and the Meaning of them
&s;o very &s;ecret, that nothing but a GOD, with whom
all Things, pa&s;t and future, are pre&s;ent, in his infi|nite
Knowledge and Wi&s;dom, could be able to di&s;|cover
them; nothing but GOD could bring Things
into Knowledge which were not to come to pa&s;s till
&s;o many Ages to come.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;e of <HI>Noah,</HI> and the Deluge, predicted
120 Years before it came to pa&s;s, you have men|tion'd
already: Come we next to <HI>Abraham;</HI> Con&s;ider
him as he was; An old Fellow of an Hundred Years
of Age, with an old Barren Wife, not le&s;s than
Ninety, and by the Cour&s;e of Nature pa&s;t Child|bearing;
behold, the&s;e two receive a Prediction from
an Angel, That they &s;hall have a Son: that from
the Loins of that Son &s;hall be produced a potent
Nation, numerous as the Stars of Heaven; that
this People &s;hall be all made Slaves for &s;everal Ages,
and that after 400 Years they &s;hall be deliver'd, and
&s;hall po&s;&s;e&s;s the Land of <HI>Canaan:</HI> How dark, how
remote, how improbable was all this? and yet every
Tittle of it is come to pa&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be&s;ides, how &s;low and backward was it
in fulfilling, how gradual and how long delay'd wa$
the Performance, as if the Promi&s;e had been for+gotten,
and the Performance neglected?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="267" REF="281">
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis very true, after this Son was born, it
was Forty Years before he married, and when he
was married, 'twas Twenty Years more before he
had a Child; <HI>Rebecca</HI> was barren Twenty Years; And
<HI>Jacob</HI> was near Forty Years more before he took a
Wife; his Father, an old Blind Man as he was, gave
away his Ble&s;&s;ing, indeed blindfold, and cau&s;ed &s;uch
a Breach between the two Sons (all the Sons he had)
that the younge&s;t was fain to run away to <HI>Padan-Aram,</HI>
and there he was Twenty Years more a poor Ser|vant,
a meer Shepherd, without Hou&s;e or Home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>So that, indeed, there was One Hundred Years
between the Promi&s;e of a Multitude, and any View
of the Family, there being only one <HI>I&s;aac</HI> and one
<HI>Jacob</HI> after him, and he but in very low Circum|&s;tances.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very true, for <HI>E&s;au,</HI> who was the Head
of the Family, and had all the E&s;tate, knew no|thing
of the Matter; he was Rich indeed, and Great,
and look'd &s;omething like being the Head of a Na|tion,
and rai&s;ing a Race; and a Race he did rai&s;e,
&s;uch a one as it was, and &s;o did <HI>I&s;hmael</HI> too, who&s;e
Race has now over-ran all the re&s;t, <HI>I mean the</HI> Turks;
but God rejected all the&s;e, and the poor Shepherd
was the Man to be rais'd up, cho&s;en to inherit the
Ble&s;&s;ing that <HI>Bethuel</HI> and <HI>Laban</HI> gave to his Mother
<HI>Rebecca,</HI> namely, To be the Mother of Thou&s;ands of
Millions, and to have his Seed po&s;&s;e&s;s the Gates of
tho&s;e that hated them; and all this, and many more
Things prophe&s;ied of them came to pa&s;s to a Tittle,
and to a Day, notwith&s;tanding all tho&s;e Delays,
notwith&s;tanding their lying, as it were, forgotten
above an Hundred Years.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then <HI>Jacob,</HI> a plain Man, a meer Shep|herd,
as you ob&s;erv'd, Sir, not given to prophe&s;y
at all, yet, when near his End, he calls his Twelve
Sons together, and, on his Death Bed, tells them
what &s;hould befall them all at the latter Days; that
<PB N="268" REF="282">
is, at the Di&s;tance of near 600 Years, and this as
punctually as if he had &s;een it all before him written
in a Book.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, he tells <HI>Judah</HI> a Race of Kings &s;hould de|&s;cend
from him, and that the Scepter &s;hould not
depart from his Family for a great while: He tells
<HI>Zebulon,</HI> that his Lot or Partition of the Land
&s;hould come out to him by the Sea-&s;ide, and &s;hould
not be far from <HI>Sidon,</HI> all which came to pa&s;s to a
Tittle.</P>
</SP>
<P>Let us &s;top here a little, for this is a remarkable
Ca&s;e; From whence had this poor old Man the
Knowledge of the&s;e Things? Was he any thing but
an old Shepherd, <HI>as you &s;aid,</HI> that lived all his Days
among the Flocks, and the Herds, and lodg'd in
his Tents? From whence could he arrive at all this
Knowledge? How &s;hould he come to know that his
Race &s;hould be &s;uch a powerful Nation? Could any
Thing human and mortal, arrive to the Knowledge
of &s;uch Things as the&s;e? No, no, nothing but
GOD could know that tho&s;e Things were to follow;
and that they were to follow is evident, for they all
came to pa&s;s ju&s;t as they were predicted: Can
any Thing Human act in this Manner! Could this
be without the Hand of GOD directing it all! it is
impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, Sir, the Prophe&s;ies of the Capti|vity,
which we nam'd la&s;t Night, are equally &s;ur|prizing
and a&s;toni&s;hing, to that we may add, the
Prediction of re&s;toring them to Liberty at the exact
End of Seventy Years.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and the very Name, Birth, and Quali|fication
of the Per&s;on, or King, that was to deliver
them, all expre&s;sly fix'd and explain'd, and even the
very Manner in which it was to be done: How ma|ny
Prophets foretel the&s;e Things, and how punctu|ally
do they come to pa&s;s?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="269" REF="283">
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed the&s;e Things do not look as if
Man could reveal and di&s;cover them, I cannot con|ceive
which way they could be predicted; it mu&s;t
be either from God or the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to that, now you have mention'd the De|vil,
it is very well worth while to ob&s;erve, that GOD
has thought fit to make the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf a Witne&s;s
to the Superiority of Scripture Predictions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>How is that, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> 'tis plain, that the Devil knows
nothing before-hand; it &s;eems very remarkable that
tho' he is an inlighten'd Seraph, an intelligent Spi|rit,
yet God has with-held from him the Knowledge
of Futurity, or taken it away from him if ever he had
it; that the whole Glory of Scripture Prophe&s;y might
naturally and nece&s;&s;arily center in him&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>So that you do not think the <HI>Devil</HI> has
any Power of Prediction, or the Knowledge of what
is to come!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, not at all; except it be that he knows
his own Fate, that he &s;hall be chain'd down at la&s;t
in the Regions of Darkne&s;s; but even of that he
does not know the Time, perhaps not the Place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But did not the <HI>Devil's</HI> Oracles predict
Things in the Time of the Pagan Idolatry?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I cannot allow that they did, they gave
out &s;ubtle, ambiguous, and doubtful An&s;wers, to
accu&s;e and delude the credulous and ignorant Peo|ple,
and this was the mo&s;t; all the re&s;t I take to
be fictitious, publi&s;h'd by the Prie&s;ts, to &s;upport
their Credit; 'twas manife&s;t, on many Occa&s;ions, and
particularly in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Julian</HI> the <HI>Apo&s;tate;</HI> he
&s;ent to all the Oracles, to all the Sooth&s;ayers, to all
the Augures, to know if his <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> War &s;hould be
pro&s;perous, and they all flatter'd him with Promi&s;es
of Victory and Glory, whereas he was kill'd in the
very fir&s;t Battle.
<PB N="270" REF="284">
Hi&s;tory informs us of a certain famous She-Magician,
who pretended that the Devil &s;poke in
her, and &s;o gave An&s;wers to all the doubtful Que&s;ti|ons
that were brought to her, and it was ob&s;erv'd
that &s;he &s;poke wonderfully of Things pa&s;t, and gave
wi&s;e Deci&s;ions in Matters of Di&s;pute; but &s;he was
always at a Lo&s;s when they enquir'd of Things to
come, and in &s;hort, to u&s;e the Words of the Au|thor

he meddled with Prophe&s;y.</HI></P>

any thing of what is doing in Heaven?</P>

&s;hould know any thing of the Coun&s;els that are tran&s;|acted
there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And this, I &s;ay, is a &s;trong Confirmation
that the Scripture is of Divine and Heavenly Ori|ginal,
&s;ince the Coun&s;els of <HI>Heaven</HI> are revealed in
it, which neither Men or <HI>Devils</HI> could ever arrive
to the Knowledge of, but from <HI>God</HI> him&s;elf, who
rules in <HI>Heaven,</HI> and who alone could reveal them.</P>

<HI>Mo&s;es, Elijah, Daniel,</HI> who the Text calls <HI>greatly
beloved,</HI> and to St. <HI>John,</HI> the <HI>beloved Di&s;ciple?</HI> and

that the <HI>Devil's</HI> Agents could never foretel

<P>Nor could they reveal <HI>Nebuchadnezzar's</HI>
Dream to him, nor read the Hand-Writing upon
the Wall to King <HI>Bel&s;hazzar;</HI> nay, they told the
King in the Ca&s;e of the fir&s;t, that it was what no
Magicians upon Earth could do, or ever were

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a particular Ca&s;e, wherein GOD ap|peared
to a wicked Man, magnifying his Power in
over-ruling what the <HI>Devil</HI> de&s;igned to do by his
Hand, and is an Argument to prove what I &s;ay,
not contradict it; for GOD reduc'd that fal&s;e Pro|phet
to the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;peaking Truth, and put
Words into his Mounth, and &s;o GOD was plea&s;ed to
<PB N="272" REF="286">
make him prophe&s;y of Chri&s;t; but it was, as he
owns, in a <HI>Trance</HI> a kind of Agitation, and he
&s;poke, by a particular In&s;piration, Things which
without it he could have known nothing of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you conclude from all this, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;ay all this confirms the Divine Authority
of the Scripture, &s;eeing as the Scripture is full of
glorious and inimitable Predictions, mo&s;t of which
are already punctually come to pa&s;s, tho' at the Di|&s;tance
of Hundreds, nay, Thou&s;ands of Years, and
that it is apparent that the <HI>Devil</HI> has no Power of
Prediction, no Fore-knowledge of Things to come;
it mu&s;t be then, that GOD alone has &s;poken in all
tho&s;e Prophe&s;ies, that the Scripture is dictated by
his immediate Spirit, and that it is really the Word
of GOD.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is an Argument indeed which I never
heard before; I always thought the <HI>Devil</HI> could tell
Folks what would come to pa&s;s, and that made me
&s;ay before, that it mu&s;t be either from GOD, or tho
<HI>Devil;</HI> I am &s;ure the <HI>Devil,</HI> and his fal&s;e pro|phets,
have always pretended to it; but I am con|vinc'd
now, and I &s;ee plainly, that, as you &s;aid, it
is not rational to think the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;hould have Cor|re&s;pondence
in <HI>Heaven,</HI> or that the Coun&s;els of Eter|nity
&s;hould be betray'd to him; it is clear to me
then, that all the Scripture Prophe&s;ies are from
<HI>Heaven.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>All from <HI>Heaven,</HI> Child! all the Voice of
GOD! GOD &s;peaking at fir&s;t, and predicting; as their
fulfilling is the Voice and Power of the &s;ame GOD
performing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what U&s;e now are we to make of the
Conclu&s;ion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>A great many Things depend upon it; <HI>for
Example,</HI> Take it in general, if the Scriptures are
really the Voice and Word of GOD, and that GOD
him&s;elf &s;peaks in them; if what is &s;aid there by the
<PB N="273" REF="287">
Mouth, or written there by the Pen of Men, or of
Man, is dictated and in&s;pired by the Holy Spirit,
and immediately from GOD, then an intire Belief
of it is ju&s;t and rea&s;onable, and is our indi&s;pen|&s;able
Duty: It is to be credited in every thing it
&s;ays, depended upon in every Promi&s;e, venerated
and trembled at in every thing it threatens, 'tis to
be receiv'd, as it indeed is, the Word of Life, the
Voice of GOD, able to make <HI>the Man of God perfect,</HI>
to make us <HI>wife to Salvation,</HI> and containing in it a
compleat Rule of Life, with every thing needful to
our eternal Felicity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that its Authority is &s;ufficient in all

<P>Yes, without doubt.</P>

this Di&s;cour&s;e, when I u&s;ed to bring a Text
of Scripture to vouch any thing I had &s;aid, would
always throw it off with Contempt, laugh at it, pre|tending
it prov'd nothing; and that it was liable to
&s;o many Exceptions it &s;elf, that it could give no
Sanction to any Opinion one Way or other.</P>
</SP>

him, becau&s;e he made him&s;elf not only equal with
God; but made him&s;elf GOD; e&s;&s;ential God.</P>
<P>Nor will that weak. Pretence &s;tand them in &s;tead
here, (<HI>viz.</HI>) Of its being meant only of their being
one in their Intere&s;t one in their Sentiments of
Things, which they call a &s;imple Union, or a mo|ral
Union; if they had under&s;tood him &s;o, they
would never have taken up Stones to &s;tone him;
for every ju&s;t and good Man de&s;ires to be united
with God.</P>
<P>It is evident they under&s;tood him of a Union in
Nature and E&s;&s;ence, nor does he blame them for
any. Mi&s;con&s;truction, plainly acknowledging that
they under&s;tood him right, ver. 36. <HI>Say ye,</HI> Thou bla&s;|&s;heme&s;t,
becau&s;e I &s;aid I am the Son of God? there he

him ju&s;t as they did.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I under&s;tand it all, Sir, perfectly; I think
'tis clear that Chri&s;t a&s;&s;erts his Divinity very expre&s;&s;ly,
and that &s;aying he is the Son of God, is plainly &s;ay|ing
he is God; but they make a great deal of Di|&s;tinction
between the Words GOD, and the <HI>Son of
GOD.</HI></P>

<P>It is evident he meant none, in this Place,
nor did the <HI>Jews</HI> under&s;tand to make any; for in
<HI>John</HI> v. 18. where they &s;ay he made him&s;elf equal
with God, it was only upon that very Expre&s;&s;ion:
<HI>He not only had broken the Sabbath, but &s;aid al&s;o, That
God was his Father, making him&s;elf equal with God.</HI></P>

<P>It is very plain, Sir, that the <HI>Jews</HI> un|der&s;tood
the Words the <HI>Son of God</HI> to <HI>mean an
E&s;&s;ential Union</HI> and Equality, and yet tho&s;e Men
will have it be that the Words God, and the Son of
God, are to be under&s;tood in the Sen&s;e of a higher
and lower.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and they found it upon tho&s;e Words,
<HI>John</HI> x. 29. and xiv. 28. <HI>My Father is greater than
I,</HI> which are evidently under&s;tood of Chri&s;t in
the Form of a Servant; and &s;uch he was in his
Humiliation, as Mediator, which 'tis plain he di|&s;tingui&s;hes
in the other Text of <HI>John</HI> v. 18. and
x. 30. In one Place he is atte&s;ting the Authority
and Dignity of his Per&s;on and in the other, he
de&s;cribes the Subordination of his Office.</P>

Chapter the xth of <HI>John,</HI> in the 25th Ver&s;e; he
de&s;cribes him&s;elf as &s;ubordinate, <HI>The Works that
I do in my Father's Name,</HI> they bear Witne&s;s of me;
that is to &s;ay, the Works which he did on Earth
he did as a Servant in his Father's Name, and in

But when he comes to te&s;tify his Divine Original,
which is quite another Point, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That he pro|ceeded
forth from God, and &s;hould return to God
again, then he &s;ays, <HI>I and my Father are one;</HI> and
adds, How can you have the Face to &s;ay I bla&s;|pheme
in &s;aying <HI>I am the Son of God?</HI> or I am equal
with God! or as the <HI>Jews</HI> &s;aid of it, that <HI>I make

What can be plainer than this Di&s;tinction, Chri&s;t
was on Earth in two Capacities? I. As an Original
Divine Being, which came <HI>forth</HI> from GOD, in
which he was of <HI>one Sub&s;tance with the Father, by
whom all Things were made;</HI> as a Me&s;&s;enger &s;ent
from God, who came hither by Divine Appoint|ment,
to fini&s;h the Work which God gave him to
do, for the Salvation of Souls, and <HI>to give his Life
a Ran&s;om for many.</HI></P>
</SP>
<P>In this Work the Text is expre&s;s, he took upon
him the <HI>Form of a Servant,</HI> he humbled <HI>him&s;elf to
Death,</HI> even <HI>the Death of the Cro&s;s;</HI> he was made a
little lower than the Angels, he was made a Cur&s;e,
made under the Law.</P>
<P>In this Capacity he might well &s;ay, <HI>My Father is
greater than I; The Cup that my Father bath given
me to drink, &s;hall I not drink it?</HI> In this Capacity
he cries out to God as for&s;aking him; in this Capa|city
he was in an Agony, &s;weat Drops of Blood,
became of no Reputation, was made Sin who knew
no Sin, and the like.</P>
<P>But when his Divine Original is the Subject, the
Scripture &s;peaks of him in another &s;ort of Stile, and
particularly he &s;peaks of him&s;elf in another Stile; he
&s;ays, <HI>Hereafter you &s;hall &s;ee the Son of Man coming in
the Clouds of Heaven;</HI> and likens his Kingdom to the
Dead hearing the Voice of the Son of God, in which,
they that hear &s;hall live.</P>
<P>It is an unaccountable A&s;&s;urance that the&s;e Men
&s;peak with, who tell us he does not declare his own
Divinity, when he &s;ays expre&s;sly, I am <HI>the Son of
God, I and my</HI> Father <HI>are ONE I proceeded forth
<PB N="284" REF="298">
and came from God,</HI> John viii. 42. <HI>I am the living
Bread which came down from</HI> Heaven, John. vi. 51.
<HI>The Father is in me and I in him,</HI> John. x. 38. and
this the <HI>Jews</HI> called his making him&s;elf one with
God, as no doubt it was, and <HI>therefore &s;ought
again to take him, but he e&s;caped out of their Hands,</HI>
John x. 39. What greater, what plainer Declara|tion
of his Godhead could be expected? and to
clo&s;e it all, when the High Prie&s;t wanting Evidence
again&s;t him adjured him to tell them if he was
the Son of the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed,</HI> declared his Godhead
before them all, I AM: See <HI>Matth.</HI> xxvi. 63, 64.
But Je&s;us held his peace. And the High Prie&s;t an|&s;wered
and &s;aid unto him, I adjure thee by the living
God, that thou tell us, whether than be the Chri&s;t the
Son of God. Je&s;us &s;aith unto him, Thou ba&s;t &s;aid:

<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not &s;ee any Weight in it, 'tis a meer Cavil;
to proceed from God, to come forth from God, to be in
God, to be the Son of God, are all &s;ynonymous, and
are only Expre&s;&s;ions of his Godhead, levelled to our
Under&s;tanding; for how would they have us to un|der&s;tand
the Words, the Son of God? Will they judge
of the Almighty after the Mea&s;ures of Human Ge|neration?
<PB N="285" REF="299">
to be a Part of infinite, is to be infinite; to
be the Son of God, begotten by the Father, is to be

adds, <HI>I and my Father are one; I am in the Fa|ther,

think they &s;hall ea&s;ily avoid the Force of all the&s;e

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>They al&s;o tell us, which I under&s;tand they
take from the <HI>Jews,</HI> That he is called the Son of
God with re&s;pect to the Dignity of his Offices, and
the Honour which God has put upon him, of being
the Advocate and Mediator between God and Man;
adding, That his miraculons Conception, by the
Operation of the Holy Gho&s;t, the extraordinary
Gift of the Spirit, which he was filled with from the
Spirit of God, al&s;o his Re&s;urrection, his A&s;cen&s;ion
into Heaven, all the&s;e having joined together, have
procured him this glorious Title of the Son of God,

Compari&s;ons, &s;uch as of Angels, Kings, Magi&s;trates,

<P>How Sir? What Difference?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, there is &s;uch a Di&s;tinction between the

gives the Title of Son of God, to tho&s;e &s;everal Sub|jects
<PB N="287" REF="301">
of it, which you mention, and when it gives the

<P><HI>Here it is, Sir.</HI> [She reads the Words thus.]
The <HI>LORD</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed me in the beginning of his way,
before his Works of old. I was &s;et up from everla&s;t|ing,
from the beginning, or ever the Earth was.
When there were no Depths, I was brought forth:
when there were no Fountains abounding with Water.
Before the Mountains were &s;ettled; before the Hills
was I brought forth: While as yet he had not made
the Earth, nor the Fields, nor the highe&s;t part of the
Du&s;t of the World. When he prepared the Heavens,
I was there: when he &s;et a Compa&s;s upon the Face of
the Depth: When he e&s;tabli&s;hed the Clouds above:
when he &s;trengthened the Fountains of the Deep: When
he gave to the Sea his Decree, that the Waters &s;hould
not pa&s;s his Commandment: when he appointed the
Foundations of the Earth: Then I was by him, as one
<PB N="288" REF="302">
brought up with him: and I was daily his Delight,
rejoycing always before him.</P>

<P>It is the Word u&s;ed in Scripture, to de&s;cribe
Eternity, and is an Evidence that Chri&s;t is a Son of

<P>Here the Son &s;poke by way of Objection, or

<P>Everla&s;ting and Eternal mu&s;t be the &s;ame
Thing, and the Words can bear no other Con&s;tru|ction;
for how can that be Everla&s;ting, that is not
Eternal? That which is Everla&s;ting had no Begin|ning,
and can have no End; if it did begin, there
was a Time when it was not; and if it could end,
there would be a Time again when it would not be,
&s;o that it cannot be Everla&s;ting; but if it be with|out
Beginning, and &s;hall have no End, it is then

that in &s;everal Places. I'll quote you but Two or

JEHOVAH <HI>reigneth.</HI> In our Tran&s;lation it is the

<P>Again, <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> tells us, Chap. vi. 1, 2, 3. <HI>I &s;aw</HI>
JEHOVAH <HI>&s;itting upon a Throne, high and lifted up,

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>How exactly one Scripture explains ano|ther!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Prophet <HI>Jeremiah</HI> calls him expre&s;ly
JEHOVAH <HI>our Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Jer.</HI> xxiii. 6. And he
has the &s;ame Title, <HI>Zach.</HI> iii. 6, 9. Now as this
Name is particular to the true GOD, Je&s;us Chri&s;t
<PB N="296" REF="310">
mu&s;t then be the True GOD; for there are not &s;e|veral

<HI>is one</HI> JEHOVAH. Or as it might be tran&s;lated, JE|HOVAH,
who is our JEHOVAH, is One JEHOVAH.
Now the Scripture giving the Name of <HI>Jehovah</HI>
both to GOD and to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and yet at the
&s;ame time declaring there is but One JEHOVAH,
Je&s;us Chri&s;t mu&s;t then be the true GOD; they can|not

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But to make this Truth, however &s;eemingly
difficult, &s;till more con&s;picuous; let me put a Que|&s;tion
for you to tho&s;e People, the An&s;wer to which,
I think, will put it out of all Doubt, that Je&s;us
Chri&s;t is not called GOD improperly, or in an indi|rect
Sen&s;e, and by Metaphor, in &s;o many Places in
Scripture, but literally and expre&s;ly; my Que&s;tion
is this, What is nece&s;&s;ary to convince any Man, that
when a Name is given to any Per&s;on, 'tis done di|rectly?
or, When may a Name be &s;aid to be given
to a Per&s;on, or a Thing, in the direct and mere li|teral
Sen&s;e of it? When they have an&s;wered this,
we &s;hall afterwards &s;ee, whether we cannot prove
that of Je&s;us Chri&s;t to be &s;o given.</P>
</SP>
<P>When one &s;ees a Statue, or Figure, or Picture
of a Man, and &s;ays, <HI>That it is a Man,</HI> and ano|ther
&s;ees that this Man has neither <HI>Fle&s;h</HI> or <HI>Bones,
Thought</HI> or <HI>Motion;</HI> that it has neither Speech or
Under&s;tanding; he pre&s;ently replies, or at lea&s;t thinks,
that 'tis improperly, and but upon &s;ome light Si|militude,
that 'tis call'd a Man.</P>
<P>But when we &s;ee that what we thought was but
an Image, is really a living Creature, bearing the
Name it repre&s;ents; that with its Figure or Appear|ance,
it &s;ees, under&s;tands, acts, &s;peaks and rea&s;ons,
<PB N="297" REF="311">
or di&s;putes upon Objects and Things; I &s;ay, when
this appears, we &s;hould take him for an Enthu&s;ia&s;t,
or a Dreamer, who &s;hould &s;ay that it was not really,
and with Propriety, to be called a Man.</P>
<P>We &s;ee appearing upon a Stage different Actors,
one repre&s;ents a private Soldier, another a Captain,
another a King; we take them all as they are (<HI>viz.</HI>)
mere Repre&s;entations; and 'tis no Delu&s;ion, the
Thing explains it&s;elf well enough.</P>
<P>But when we &s;ee a Man giving Law to a whole
Country, obey'd by the People, to whom they
pay Tribute, and to whom they pay all the Homage
which is due to a Sovereign Prince; we make not
the lea&s;t Difficulty to &s;ay and point it out to any
Body, that this is really a Sovereign Prince, an Em|peror
or King, and 'twould be fooli&s;h to the la&s;t
Degree, to ask whether it was done properly, or in a
Metaphor.</P>
<P>The Holy Scriptures, in &s;everal Places, have given
to Chri&s;t the Title of GOD, JEHOVAH, the
GOD <HI>of Ho&s;ts,</HI> the GOD of <HI>Abraham, I&s;aac,</HI>
and <HI>Jacob,</HI> and &s;everal other Titles, which are ne|ver
given to any but the <HI>true</HI> GOD; the Rea&s;on
is plain, they acknowledge that there are all the
Characters in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which belong to, and
de&s;cribe the true GOD; <HI>&s;uch as the&s;e,</HI> viz.</P>

him &s;o; for in one Place they took up Stones
to &s;tone him, <HI>ver. 33. for Bla&s;phemy, and that thou,
being a Man, make&s;t thy &s;elf</HI> GOD: And in the other,
for Bla&s;phemy, when they hurry'd him to his Cru|cifixion;
the Crimes were the &s;ame as under&s;tood by
them, and the Words were the &s;ame (<HI>viz.) That
he was the Chri&s;t the Son of the Ble&s;&s;ed;</HI> and how
<PB N="300" REF="314">
could it be Bla&s;phemy to &s;ay he was the Son of God,
if the Meaning had not been to make him&s;elf God,
I think the Thing is plain, and the Con&s;equence
natural.</P>

<P>Be&s;ides, Son, as Chri&s;t &s;ays of him&s;elf, <HI>John</HI>
x. 28. &s;peaking of Believers as of Sheep following
him, who was the good Shepherd, <HI>I give unto them eter|nal
Life: Can a Man give eternal Life!</HI> Can a Man
lay down his Life for the Sins of other Men? Can the
Life of a Man be a Ran&s;om for the World? Is there
any one Scripture that intimates a Parity? He is in|deed
called our High-Prie&s;t entering into the Holy of
Holies, by Way of Allu&s;ion to the Annual Atone|ment,
and as an Explanation of the Type and the
Thing typify'd; but it was the Divine Per&s;on of
Chri&s;t alone, which could make an Equality or Pro|portion
between the Type and the thing typify'd,
and could make the Price paid be equal to the
Purcha&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<P>Now 'tis plain, Chri&s;t &s;ays of him&s;elf, 1. <HI>Th$$
he gives eternal Life. 2. That he lays down, or gives
his Life a Ran&s;om. John</HI> iii. 17. 'Tis &s;aid, <HI>God $word$
him into the World, that the World through him might
be &s;aved.</HI> Could the World be &s;aved through the
Interce&s;&s;ion of a Man! Again, <HI>He is the Propiti$|tion
for our Sins; and not for our Sins only, but for
the Sins of the whole World, 1 John</HI> ii. 2.</P>

<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>They will allow that he might be all this&punc;
and yet be but a Man; as <HI>Aaron</HI> the High-Prie&s;t
made an Atonement by Sacrifice for the Sins of the
People.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>As tho&s;e Sacrifices were a Type of the Great
Sacrifice to be offered up, it might be adequate to the
Purpo&s;e for which they were intended; but $word$
manife&s;t they were no otherwi&s;e accepted in Atone|ment,
but as they look'd to, and cau&s;ed the <HI>I&s;raelit$</HI>
<PB N="301" REF="315">
to look to the great Propitiation, the Me&s;&s;iah which
was to come, and in the Faith of whom all the be|lieving

no other than Types of that Blood which was ap|pointed
to be the great Propitiation.</P>
</SP>

<P>Tho' this is true, and we believe it all, yet
the&s;e Men &s;ay 'tis all dark and &s;uppo&s;ititious, and
that it proves nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you what it proves; 1. It proves by the
univer&s;al Con&s;ent of the Scripture, that Chri&s;t is the
promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah; and the &s;ame Scripture proves
that the Me&s;&s;iah was to be the Son of God; nay, was
to be really and e&s;&s;entially God; this is clear by all
the Prophe&s;ies of the Old Te&s;tament, and by the
fulfilling tho&s;e Promi&s;es in the New.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>That would argue well again&s;t the <HI>Jews,</HI>
who neither believe him to be the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> or that
the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> is yet come.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would confute and confound both the Infi|del

not hardened beyond the Power of Evidence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would not be unprofitable, Sir, if we
were informed of tho&s;e Points too, for the <HI>Jews</HI>
do not allow the Godhead and Deity of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI>
any more than the Hereticks do the Divinity of
Chri&s;t, and &s;eem to go both upon the &s;ame Prin|ciple.</P>

the <HI>Arians</HI> will grant that this is he, that Chri&s;t is
the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah;</HI> but then they abate the Lu&s;tre of his
Divinity, take off the Dignity of his Per&s;on, and
look upon him to be far le&s;s in his Per&s;onal Glory,
than the <HI>Jews</HI> allow the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> &s;hall be when he

be? and how they knew there was any &s;uch Per&s;on
to come into the World?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know but one An&s;wer they have to give
to &s;uch a Que&s;tion; and that is, That all the Scrip|tures
of the Old Te&s;tament &s;peak of him, de&s;cribe
his Per&s;on and his Glory; that all the Prophets
predict his Coming; and &s;ome of them even point
out the Time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, that is their An&s;wer, and it is
a &s;ufficient An&s;wer; 'tis &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify their Ex|pectation
of &s;uch a Per&s;on, and their Faith in all
that was predicted concerning him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and our An&s;wer is taken from the
&s;ame: It is true, that the Scripture, that is, the Old
Te&s;tament, is full of the Prophe&s;ies of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI>
the De&s;cription of his Per&s;on, the pointing out the
Time, the Particulars, and the Event of his Com|ing;
and I add, there is not one of all tho&s;e Pre|dictions
but what is fulfilled in the Per&s;on and Ap|pearing
of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; all the De&s;criptions of his
Per&s;on center in the Per&s;on of Chri&s;t; and the Times,
the Particulars, and the Event of his Coming, all
meet in the appearing of Chri&s;t in the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>It is &s;o; there's not an eminent Action, or

<P>The fir&s;t of all, and which is almo&s;t as ancient as

<HI>Adam</HI> and his <HI>Wife,</HI> our fir&s;t Parents, a&s;&s;ures
them of a Remedy for their Defection, and for the

Principles of a large Tree is retained in its Fruit, yet
as it is in the Ca&s;e of the Seed or Fruit, being bu|ried
in the Earth, the Principles revive, and in the
Cour&s;e of Time, produce its Kind; &s;o God has, in
Con&s;equence of that dormant Prophe&s;y, happily
brought other Prophe&s;ies upon the Stage, which

<P>It was &s;o, indeed, <HI>Abraham</HI> had but one Son
<HI>I&s;aac,</HI> and not that till he was a Hundred Years old:
<HI>I&s;aac</HI> went Forty Years Childle&s;s; and when he had
Children, it wanted but a little that <HI>Jacob,</HI> on whom
the promi&s;ed Seed was entailed, had been murthered
by his Brother: But he e&s;caping, and the Ble&s;&s;ing
going along with <HI>Jacob,</HI> by the expre&s;s Command
of God, yet he fled into Bondage and Mi&s;ery, and
endured it Twenty Years.</P>
</SP>
<P><HI>Jacob</HI> has Twelve Sons, and yet as he po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the
Birth-right and the Promi&s;e, notwith&s;tanding he had
not the Primogeniture, but was the younge&s;t Son;
&s;o God thought fit to pa&s;s by Three of his Sons, and
fix upon <HI>Judah,</HI> the Fourth Son, to be the Source
of the Royal Seed, and the Line of the Promi&s;e.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>The&s;e are all Tokens, that however the

<P>Seventy Weeks are determined upon thy People, and

Iniquity, and, to bring in everla&s;ting Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and
to &s;eal up the Vi&s;ion and Prophecy, and to anoint the

build <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> unto the Me&s;&s;iah the Prince, &s;hall be
Seven Weeks; and Three&s;core and Two Weeks the
Street &s;hall be built again, and the Wall, even in
troublous Times. And after Three&s;core and Two
Weeks &s;hall Me&s;&s;iah be cut off, but not for him&s;elf:
And the People of the Prince that &s;hall come, &s;hall de|&s;troy
the City and the Sanctuary, and the End thereof
&s;hall be with a Flood, and unto the End of the War
De&s;olations are determined. And he &s;hall confirm the
Covenant with many for one Week: And in the mid&s;t of
the Week he &s;hall cau&s;e the Sacrifice and the Oblation to
cea&s;e, and for the over&s;preading of Abominations he
&s;hall make it de&s;olate, even until the Con&s;ummation,

how it is made out; but let me go on with the
Prophe&s;ies. In the fir&s;t Place, <HI>God,</HI> in Mercy to his
Church, and for the Support of their Faith, has
joined to tho&s;e Prophe&s;ies, which were the fir&s;t
Foundation of their Faith, a continued Chain of
Prophe&s;y, which gives a lively De&s;cription of the
Per&s;on of the Me&s;&s;iah.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why fir&s;t, <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> &s;peaks of him, as if he had
&s;een him with his Eyes; the Royal Prophet is full
of him in all his <HI>P&s;alms;</HI> and 'tis remarkable, that
almo&s;t all the Prophets mention the Me&s;&s;iah, not as
that glorious King which the <HI>Jews</HI> expected him to
be, but in the&s;e Two particular Articles, <HI>viz.</HI> that of
his Humiliation or Aba&s;ement, and that of his Suf|ferings;
this you may ob&s;erve in reading the ii,
viii, xvi, xxii, lxix, ci, cx. <HI>P&s;alms;</HI> but the liii.
Chap. of <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> is a formal Proof of this Part, where
the Me&s;&s;iah is repre&s;ented in all the Aba&s;ement of
his State of Humiliation; as al&s;o in <HI>Zech.</HI> ix. 9
there the Humiliation of the Me&s;&s;iah is fully repre|&s;ented:
This is certainly done, that in the Ages to
come, when the Church &s;hould &s;ee this great and glo|rious
Gift come to Light, yet veil'd in &s;uch a parti|cular
Manner, they might be able to &s;ay, <HI>Behold $word$
Man!</HI> This is the Holy One of God, the Me&s;&s;iah&punc;
and we cannot look for another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>The&s;e are the Advantages of great Read|ing
and long Study of the Scriptures; I never div'$
thus far into this glorious Truth; but it is a gre$
and wonderful Di&s;covery of the Glory of the <HI>Me&s;|&s;iah,</HI>
that he is &s;o perfectly de&s;crib'd, and &s;o &s;et for$$
in all the Prophets.</P>

Good, and Good Evil, make all this Light be
Darkne&s;s to them; and yet, after all this, expect
&s;till the Coming of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah;</HI> Light has come in
to their Darkne&s;s, and that Darkne&s;s comprehendeth it
not. He cried to them at his Coming, <HI>Behold me,

and bring it to their Party, but it will not do; there
is not one Text in <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> upon which they dare &s;ay
<HI>There he is:</HI> When that Evangelick Prophet de&s;cribes
the Me&s;&s;iah, chap. viii. and &s;ays, <HI>Behold a Virgin

which he calls a Me&s;&s;iah.</P>

they rate the Words of that Prophet, chap. ix. ver.
5, 6. as the Words of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> tho' there is no
Text in the whole Bible which looks more in their
Favour; becau&s;e it &s;eems to di&s;play his Power and
Grandeur, and &s;ets him not on the Throne of his
Father <HI>David</HI> only, but even on the Throne of GOD.</P>
</SP>

<P>The <HI>Jews</HI> are hardened again&s;t all kind of
Rea&s;oning; they believe nothing, no not the next
Hour what they &s;aid the Hour before; nothing, how|ever
plain, can convince them: What Shuffling do
they make with the Words of <HI>Jacob, Till Shiloh come?</HI>
Enquiring, <HI>Who is this Shilo,</HI> and what he is to be

that the &s;econd Temple &s;hould be in being at
the Time of the Me&s;&s;iah's Coming; It was built
in the Time of tho&s;e Prophets, as we may &s;ee above;
now 'tis plain that the &s;econd Temple has been de|&s;troyed
above 1600 Years, and where then is the

<P>Let the Criticks examine this Point with the

are calculated for Years: Now 70 Weeks is the Time
appointed for the Continuance of the &s;econd Tem|ple,
which is ju&s;t 490 Days, and ju&s;t &s;o many Years
was it, from the Edict of <HI>Cyrus</HI> for the Return of the

<P>Well, but look again, &s;ee the Prophet <HI>Hag|gai;</HI>
he was alive at the Building of the Second

Builders of it to encourage them, when their Hearts
failed them, and when they mourned at the Sight
of what it was like to be, compared to the fir&s;t
glorious Hou&s;e which they had &s;een; and he tells
them the Glory of this Second Temple, however
mean it appeared, &s;hould be greater than that of the
fir&s;t: See the Place, Child.</P>

<P><HI>Here it is, Sir,</HI> Haggai <HI>ii.</HI> 7, 8, 9. [She
reads the Words.] And I will &s;hake all Nations,

this Hou&s;e with Glory, &s;aith the Lord of Ho&s;ts. The
Silver is mine, and the Gold is mine, &s;aith the Lord

<P>Yes, <HI>Simeon</HI> took him in his Arms in the

declaring, <HI>That his Eyes had &s;een his Salvation,</HI> that

plain the Prophe&s;ies can never be fulfilled now, for
the &s;econd Temple is gone, nor can it be that the

Years for the Impenitence of the <HI>Jews</HI> only! It is
a prepo&s;terous thing, and ab&s;urd beyond any one's
Patience to bear, that the <HI>Jews</HI> &s;hould arrogate the
Effects of the Me&s;&s;iah's Death all to them&s;elves,
when he &s;o often has been declared to be a Propi|tiation
for the Sins of the whole World; And are
the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and all the Nations of the World, for

Church, be without Hope, and without God in the

<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is the Ca&s;e indeed; let me &s;tate it in
the mo&s;t familiar Terms po&s;&s;ible, that the very
Children may under&s;tand it: If we will but look
back a little, and marking fir&s;t the Time of the
Me&s;&s;iah's coming, as predicted in the Scripture,
and then examining the Hi&s;tory of what happened
at that Time in the World; the&s;e two Enquiries

<SP>

<P>Let us ob&s;erve it, a little critically, how the
Concurrence of the Prophets appeared, and how
Things &s;tood in the World about that Time: Ju&s;t
at the End of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Commonwealth, when
the Scepter was ju&s;t departing from <HI>Judah,</HI> while
the &s;econd Temple, though near its De&s;truction,
was yet &s;tanding, and the very Year when the
Seventy Weeks mention'd in the Prophe&s;y of <HI>Da|niel</HI>
were accompli&s;hed, namely, the 490th Year
after the Return of the Captivity, ju&s;t at that
very Time, would the <HI>Jews</HI> look back upon it,
they would find one <HI>JESUS</HI> walking up and down
in the Land of <HI>Judea;</HI> the Son of one <HI>Mary,</HI> di|rectly
de&s;cended of the Family of <HI>David,</HI> and born
at the little City of <HI>Bethlehem;</HI> his &s;aid Mother re|puted
a Virgin though e&s;pou&s;ed, and having never
known Man; all particularly predicted of the
<HI>Me&s;&s;iah.</HI></P>
</SP>
<P>This JESUS, (&s;uppo&s;ing them not to know him by
the Particulars of his Birth, and the Concurrence of
the Predictions of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI>) yet makes him&s;elf
appear to be &s;omething wonderful in his Per&s;on; by
the Holine&s;s of his Life, his Zeal for God, and
the Doctrine which he preached; his very Enemies
confe&s;&s;ing, <HI>That never Man &s;poke as he &s;poke; and
were a&s;toni&s;hed at his Doctrine, for he taught as one
having Authority.</HI></P>

<P>It is very remarkable indeed, and I never

come.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is plain tho&s;e that under&s;tood Scripture
Prophe&s;ies, knew the Time of his Coming could
not be far of, and expected it: It is &s;aid of &s;e|veral
Per&s;ons, that they waited for him; <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> of
<HI>Arimathea</HI> waited for the Kingdom of God; <HI>Simeon</HI>
waited for the Con&s;olation of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and <HI>Anna</HI>
the Prophete&s;s &s;pake of him to tho&s;e that looked

Time.</P>

with another; but I come to the Concurrence
of Particulars in the Per&s;on and Coming of Chri&s;t,
with the Predictions of the Scripture concerning the
<HI>Me&s;&s;iah.</HI> There appeared, I &s;ay, at that very
Time, one JESUS, holy in Life, wonderful in Doc|trine;
one JESUS, who&s;e Conver&s;ation was a Pat|tern
of Meekne&s;s, Patience, and Humility; one
JESUS, who&s;e whole Bu&s;ine&s;s, nay, his Meat and
Drink, was to advance the Honour of God, and
do good to all his Creatures; giving him&s;elf no Re&s;t,
but travelling from Place to Place, from Hou&s;e to
Hou&s;e, and from City to City, doing good, and
every where leaving &s;urprizing Te&s;timonies of a

<PB N="316" REF="330">
one Place he gives Sight to the Blind, and to one

a Cripple Eight and Thirty Years, he heals with a

and immediately the Man, immoveable before, and
laid at length upon his &s;orry Mattre&s;s, or perhaps
a Bundle of Straw, &s;tarts up, &s;tands upright, walks
about, and all the City of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> &s;ees him at
the Feet of his Deliverer, glorifying God for his
Recovery, and are Witne&s;&s;es of the Miracle.</P>

re&s;tored to his Mother. Another Time, coming to
<HI>Bethany,</HI> he finds his Friend <HI>Lazarus</HI> dead and bu|ried,
and all the Family in Tears; he bids them
&s;hew him where they had laid him, and though it
was in a deep Vault, a large Cave, according to
the U&s;age of the Country; Here, though he had
been dead Four Days, and was &s;uppo&s;ed to be a pu|trified
Carca&s;s, yet his Voice penetrates the Cavern:
<HI>Lazarus,</HI> COME FORTH, &s;ays the Omnipotent in car|nated

my Eyes? Can any thing but God open the Eyes
of one born Blind? Was it ever known in the

of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which are very ob&s;ervable,
and which render them more con&s;picuous than any
of tho&s;e performed by the Prophets.</P>
<P>1. 'Tis very remarkable, that to make the <HI>Jews</HI>
the more attentive to the Miracles of Je&s;us
Chri&s;t in particular, the Wi&s;dom of God
thought fit to put a kind of a Stop to the
Working of Miracles in general, for above Five
Hundred Years, immediately before Chri&s;t;
even <HI>John</HI> the Bapti&s;t wrought no Miracles,
though he was &s;o univer&s;ally received and
applauded, and all <HI>Judea</HI> ran after him;
it &s;eemed too much that the Servant, who was
&s;o near his Ma&s;ter's coming, &s;hould act in the
&s;ame Method.</P>
<P>2. The Miracles that followed after Chri&s;t's Time,
and which were done by the Apo&s;tles, were
rather the Miracles of Chri&s;t him&s;elf, than their
own, and were all acted in his Name, and by
his Power working in them.</P>
<P>Now can any one think, God would bring all
the&s;e concurring Particulars, and all the true Cha|racters
of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> to meet in one Per&s;on, and
yet this Per&s;on not to be the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah?</HI> the Time,
the Birth, the exemplary holy Life, the Wi&s;dom,
the Doctrine, the Miracles, all joining together
with the Predictions; and not one Tittle of all that
had been foretold of him failing to come exactly
and punctually to pa&s;s; and yet that this <HI>&s;hould not

be he that &s;hould come,</HI> but that we <HI>mu&s;t look for
another.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>He mu&s;t be the true Me&s;&s;iah, or one of the
greate&s;t Deceivers and Impo&s;tors that ever was in
the World; I can &s;ee no room for any thing
el&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I come therefore to the Te&s;timony he gives
of him&s;elf by Word and by Miracle. This <HI>Je&s;us</HI>
declares him&s;elf to be the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> on every Occa|&s;ion,
and in one Place tells them expre&s;sly, If ye
believe not that I am he, <HI>ye &s;hall die in your Sins.</HI>
To convince them of the Truth of it, he works
innumerable Miracles, and tho&s;e &s;uch as, it was
evident, had no Fraud or Illu&s;ion in them, and
could not be done to deceive; that had for Wit|ne&s;&s;es
only as many as the Country of <HI>Judea,</HI> and
<HI>Galilee,</HI> and all the neighbouring Provinces had In|habitants,
and yet this Man is not to be believed;
God is too jealous of his Glory to &s;et his Seal to a
Deceiver and Impo&s;tor, and that of the greate&s;t and
wor&s;t Kind, as this mu&s;t be, if it was &s;o at all,
and if Je&s;us Chri&s;t is not the true Me&s;&s;iah.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Miracles were always taken for a Confirma|tion
of the Truth of any Doctrine, and of the
Authority of the Preacher too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> is an admirable Example
of it; he was known all over <HI>Egypt</HI> to be the true
Me&s;&s;enger of God, by the Miracles which he wrought
there; nay, he was empowered to work tho&s;e Mi|racles
purely to obtain his Admittance, and to be
believed as a true Me&s;&s;enger of God, and not only
the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> but even his own People fir&s;t re|ceived
him, and acknowledg'd him as &s;uch on that
very Account: They did the &s;ame Ju&s;tice to all
the other Prophets after him on the very &s;ame Ac|count,
and according to the Degrees, and the Num|bers
of tho&s;e Miracles, they were valued and re|ceiv'd;
And is there none then but JESUS that is
<PB N="320" REF="334">
not to be believed! Certainly the <HI>Jews</HI> are very
unhappy in their particular Malice again&s;t Chri&s;t as
the Me&s;&s;iah, in that they cannot deny him this
Ju&s;tice, without openly expo&s;ing the Honour of
their own Prophets: And refu&s;ing to acknowledge
Chri&s;t to be the Me&s;&s;iah, after &s;uch an innumera|ble
Multitude of Miracles of every Kind, is a formal
Accu&s;ation of their Fore-fathers, and of the whole
<HI>I&s;raeliti&s;h</HI> Church, for having believed lightly, and
upon the Authority of &s;ome few Miracles only, all
the Patriarchs and Prophets, &s;uch as <HI>Mo&s;es, Jo|&s;hua,
Samuel,</HI> and others, to be the true Mini&s;ters
of God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, it &s;eems as if God had then dropt the
Authority or Te&s;timony of the Prophets on this
Occa&s;ion, had made tho&s;e very <HI>Jews,</HI> who are the
Subject of our Contempt, and even Judai&s;m it&s;elf,
to become the principal Rampart of the Chri&s;tian
Faith.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Deceit lay much of it in the fir&s;t Delu|&s;ion
of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Nation; they expected and
hoped for a glorious <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> a particular <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI>
or King, that &s;hould re&s;tore their Kingdom, and
&s;hould appear at the Head of a great Army; rich,
gay, potent, and victorious; that &s;hould deliver
their Country from the <HI>Roman</HI> Yoke, and make
the Name of the <HI>Jews</HI> the Terror of the World;
whereas this <HI>Je&s;us</HI> appeared in a quite contrary Fi|gure;
poor, abject, and mean, who, 'till he was
Thirty Years old, dwelt in an ob&s;cure Retreat, in
the Hou&s;e of a Carpenter, and when he came
abroad in the World, was attended only by a few
poor Fi&s;hermen of <HI>Galilee,</HI> who he gathered together
upon the Lake there. In his Behaviour, &s;o meek,
and &s;o humble, that, as the Text &s;ays, He &s;uffered
not his Voice to be heard in the Streets; and when
the People, ravi&s;hed and &s;urprized with the Power
and Energy of his Preaching, and with the Won|ders
<PB N="321" REF="335">
of his Miracles, would have made him a King,
he withdrew from them into a &s;ecret Place: His
Doctrine was the &s;ame, he preached nothing but
Repentance, Humility, Meekne&s;s, Peace, Union,
and the Love of our Enemies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>The <HI>Jews</HI> might well, indeed, be &s;tumbled
and offended, it was a great Di&s;appointment to them
to be &s;ure, and they contemned him accordingly; on
that very Account.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why &s;hould they be &s;o? Was it not the
very De&s;cription given of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> by the Pro|phets,
&s;ee <HI>I&s;aiah lii. 14. As many were a&s;tonied at
thee; (his Vi&s;age was &s;o marred more than any Man,
and his Form more than the Sons of Men.</HI>) P&s;alm
cix. 22. <HI>For I am poor and needy, and my Heart is
wounded within me.</HI> Zech. ix. 9. <HI>Rejoyce greatly, O
Daughter of</HI> Zion, <HI>&s;hout, O Daughter of</HI> Jeru&s;alem:
<HI>behold, thy King cometh unto thee: He is ju&s;t, and
having Salvation, lowly, and riding upon an A&s;s,
and upon a Colt the Foal of an A&s;s.</HI> All the&s;e Texts
the <HI>Jews</HI> had read, and many more, in their
Prophets; but they would not have them belong to
the Me&s;&s;iah, or would they own the Marks when
vi&s;ible in Je&s;us Chri&s;t; but they would have it be
that GOD &s;hould &s;end them a Saviour according to
their own Notions, rather than according to what
he him&s;elf promi&s;ed and de&s;cribed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;ee plainer into this than ever I did;
the low Condition of the Me&s;&s;iah was an Offence to
them to be &s;ure, and blinded them, and they could
not &s;ee him, or know him if they did &s;ee him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, let us take the &s;ame Method in exa|mining
the Particular of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> after his Death;
&s;ee there the Effect of their rejecting him, and how
all Things that he foretold them came to pa&s;s: He
threatened them, that for their refu&s;ing him, and
not knowing in their Days the Things of their
Peace, <HI>their Hou&s;e &s;hould be left unto them de&s;olate,</HI>
<PB N="322" REF="336">
and they &s;hould be delivered up to the Sword of
their Enemies; that <HI>Judea</HI> &s;hould be made a la|mentable
Scene of all the Horror and Mi&s;eries of
War; that <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> &s;hould be be&s;ieg'd, taken,
&s;ack'd, and demoli&s;h'd to its very Foundations;
the Temple &s;hould be overturned, and not one Stone
left upon another that &s;hould not be thrown down;
and a great many &s;uch like, all which came to
pa&s;s in le&s;s than Forty Years after the Death of
Chri&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, the Judgment of God &s;eems to pur&s;ue
them to this Day, while they are &s;cattered over the
Face of the whole Earth, and the Wrath of God
&s;eems &s;till to abide upon them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And in the mean time this <HI>Je&s;us</HI> then pa&s;&s;ing
through the State of his Humiliation, is now ex|alted,
<HI>the Stone which the Builders rejected</HI> is <HI>become
the Head of the Corner;</HI> he reigns through the whole

alone continues ob&s;tinate, according to the <HI>Pro|phe&s;ies

<P>And what do the <HI>Jews</HI> &s;ay to all this?</P>

<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, What can they &s;ay? Can they deny
that this great Event of the Calling of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI>
and the Downfal of Idolatry and Pagani&s;m, have
been noted by the Prophets as a proper Token of
the Coming of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah?</HI> that GOD promi&s;ed to
<HI>Abraham,</HI> that in his Seed, which is the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> all

read the Second <HI>P&s;alm,</HI> where God promi&s;es to the
<HI>Me&s;&s;iah, Ask of me, and I will give thee the Heathen
for thine Inheritance, and the uttermo&s;t Parts of the

which I might mention?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>That they have read all the&s;e Scriptures we
know, but do they under&s;tand them to belong to
Je&s;us Chri&s;t?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>They under&s;tand them to belong to the
<HI>Me&s;&s;iah;</HI> all their Writers acknowledge it, and
our Saviour quoting many of tho&s;e Texts to them
concerning him&s;elf, appeals to them as under&s;tand|ing
them &s;o: They told him, in one Place, That
<HI>Elias mu&s;t fir&s;t come,</HI> and he tells them <HI>Elias,</HI> which
was <HI>John</HI> the Bapti&s;t, <HI>was already come;</HI> and in
many Places 'tis evident that by the Light of Scrip|ture
Prophe&s;ies, and the Calculation of Events, they
them&s;elves believed that the Me&s;&s;iah was at Hand,
and that he was expected about that Time; but
they would not believe that this was &s;o, and this
Unbelief was their Overthrow and De&s;truction, and
is &s;o to this Day.</P>

<HEAD>DIALOGUE IV.</HEAD>
<P>THE Father, who is here called, very ju&s;t|ly,
<HI>The In&s;tructor</HI> of his <HI>Family,</HI> was very
well plea&s;ed with the Occa&s;ion which his Daughter
gave him to enter into the Di&s;pute about the
Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t being the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> as al&s;o of the
<HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> being already come; as it is oppo&s;ed to
the Ob&s;tinacy of the <HI>Jews,</HI> who expect a Me&s;&s;iah
yet to come, and deny that Je&s;us, who is alrea|dy
come, is the Me&s;&s;iah. His Daughter de&s;ired
to have the&s;e Things &s;et in a clear View to her,
not that &s;he did not already believe them, but
being acquainted with &s;ome <HI>Jews</HI> Ladies, and
having frequent Occa&s;ion to be among them, and
hear them talk of the&s;e Things, &s;he de&s;ired to make
her &s;elf Mi&s;tre&s;s of &s;uch Arguments as, on any Oc|ca&s;ion
of Di&s;cour&s;e, might be&s;t defend her own
Principles, and confute theirs; and of the &s;ame U&s;e,
I hope, it may be to others, to have the&s;e Argu|ments
repeated in this Place.</P>
<P>But their Father had another View in it al&s;o,
namely, That having been di&s;cour&s;ing before of the
Divinity of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and how evidently it ap|peared
by the Te&s;timony of the Scriptures that he
was the Son of God; and that in the full Sen&s;e
of that Expre&s;&s;ion, as he had explained it, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
That he was the Lord <HI>Jehovah;</HI> real, very God,
e&s;&s;ential and equal with his Father, and that by the
Nature of God, and all the Ideas we are able to
<PB N="325" REF="339">
form in our Minds of an infinite indivi&s;ible Being,
it can be no otherwi&s;e, but that to be the Son of
God, and to come forth from God, mu&s;t be under|&s;tood
to be the &s;ame as God.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, having been di&s;cour&s;ing of this, it occurred
mo&s;t naturally to him, that the Proof from Scrip|ture
of Chri&s;t being the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> nece&s;&s;arily carried
with it a farther and full Di&s;covery of his Divinity,
and of his eternal Power and <HI>Godhead;</HI> &s;ince many
of the Scripture Prophe&s;ies of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> evidently
demon&s;trate him to be more than Human, and
join in with the Te&s;timony of his Divinity at the
&s;ame Time that they predict his appearing upon
Earth; giving Divine Honours to his Name, to his
Per&s;on, and to his Power; te&s;tifying, as he &s;ays of
him&s;elf, that he came forth from God.</P>
<P>As this made him willing to enter into the Scrip|ture
Evidence of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> &s;o it made him al&s;o
bring back the Di&s;cour&s;e of the Me&s;&s;iah to the Per|&s;on
of Chri&s;t, as GOD, and as equal with the Father;
Accordingly he told his Daughter, at the Clo&s;e of
the former Di&s;cour&s;e, that having thus &s;ufficiently
furni&s;hed her to talk with her Acquaintances
among the <HI>Jews,</HI> and to confute all their Cavils
at the Certainty of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI>'s being come,
according to the Text, and that <HI>this was he,</HI> and
that we do not <HI>look for another;</HI> he thought it was
a very good Opportunity to furni&s;h her al&s;o, and
her Brother and Si&s;ter with Arguments to &s;trengthen
their Faith in the Dignity and Divine Glory of the
Per&s;on of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah;</HI> and to prove to her, that as
the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> was to be more than Man, his Per&s;on
Divine and Eternal, his Glory everla&s;ting, and
his Throne for ever and ever; &s;o this Chri&s;t, who
is the Me&s;&s;iah, exactly an&s;wers to all the Scripture
Prophe&s;ies of that Divinity and Glory; as he does
to tho&s;e of his Office, of his Sufferings for Sin,
<PB N="326" REF="340">
of his Humility, and of his being the King and Head
of his Church.</P>
<P>This occa&s;ion'd the following Dialogue, wherein
the good Father does not &s;o much engage with the
pre&s;ent Cavils of the Modern Di&s;putants, or their
&s;ubtle Eva&s;ions of plain Scripture, which te&s;tify the
Divinity of Chri&s;t founded on the different Read|ings
of &s;uch and &s;uch Texts, by which they &s;tudy
rather to perplex the Debate, than bring it to a Cer|tainty;
as he does by clear Rea&s;oning upon &s;uch Ex|pre&s;&s;ions
as are undi&s;puted and plain References to
Scripture Prophe&s;ies of Chri&s;t, make it plain that
as Chri&s;t mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity be the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> that
was to come, the <HI>Shiloh</HI> that was promi&s;ed, the
Seed of the Woman that was to break the Head of
the Serpent; &s;o the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> was to be the Son of
GOD, and that he that is &s;o, is GOD; that he is Eter|nal,
and Infinite, and Omni&s;cient, and Omnipotent,
that he acted on Earth with Divine Authority, a&s;&s;ert|ed
his Divine Original, and has in Scripture Divine
Honours paid him.</P>
<P>In order to introduce this great Head of Argu|ment,
he takes an Occa&s;ion one Evening, when his
Daughter &s;eemed to be bringing on &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e
of much le&s;s Con&s;equence, to turn her off from it
thus.</P>
<P>My Dear, we have di&s;cour&s;ed fully upon the
Subject of Chri&s;t being the promi&s;ed <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> and
that this <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> is really and actually COME, accord|ing
as was foretold by the Prophets, and al&s;o at the
very Time it was foretold; I hope you are able to
maintain that Cau&s;e now again&s;t your <HI>Jews</HI> Ladies
with whom you are acquainted.</P>

glorious Sen&s;e as I de&s;cribed it; &s;o that the Me&s;&s;iah

<P>And yet nothing is more plainly prophe&s;ied

expre&s;sly, 2 <HI>Col.</HI> xv. <HI>over Principalities and Powers;</HI>

not di&s;tingui&s;h his Per&s;on from his Office, as when

<P>Yes, and &s;o no doubt they would if we take
them to mean one and the &s;ame identical Per&s;on

of the Words; and &s;o Chri&s;t mu&s;t be acknowledged
to &s;peak the mo&s;t unintelligible Non&s;en&s;e, contra|dicting
him&s;elf in a manner not reconcileable by
any Con&s;truction in the World; nor is it any way
reconcileable but by this of his Divine and Human
Nature united.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>One would think this very thing &s;hould con|vince
them, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That as they allow him to be the
<HI>Son of God,</HI> (however &s;ubordinate to GOD him&s;elf) they
mu&s;t yet believe that he would neither talk fal&s;ely
or fooli&s;hly, neither talk unintelligibly or non&s;en|&s;ically,
neither with Contradiction or Ab&s;urdity,
and that therefore there mu&s;t be &s;ome higher Con|&s;truction

mu&s;t be really GOD, or the wor&s;t and vile&s;t of
Men, the greate&s;t Impo&s;tor and Bla&s;phemer; who,
being but <HI>a meer Man,</HI> yet accepted of Divine Ho|nours,
a&s;&s;umed the Divine Authority in his Actions,

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have ob&s;erved indeed that Chri&s;t there
owns him&s;elf to be the Son of GOD, that is, to be

<P>But now di&s;tingui&s;hing rightly of the two

him to &s;peak of him&s;elf, in the di|&s;tinct
Capacities of a GOD incarnated, and of a Man,
it is &s;till plainer; &s;peaking of him as real GOD, <HI>the
Creator of the World, by whom all Things were made,</HI>
John i. 3. and as <HI>real Man,</HI> the Mediator, giving his
Life a Ran&s;om for many; This Way it is all re|conciled
at once: <HI>As Man,</HI> he is the true Shepherd,
and layeth down his Life for his Sheep; <HI>As God,</HI> he
giveth eternal Life to his Sheep, and none &s;hall
pluck them out of his Hand; <HI>As Man,</HI> his Father is
greater than all; <HI>As God,</HI> he is in the Father and
the Father in him; <HI>As Man,</HI> he knoweth nothing,

<SP>
<PB N="333" REF="347">

<P>It would be endle&s;s indeed to reckon up all
the &s;everal Texts in the Scripture, which a&s;&s;ure
us of the Divinity of his Per&s;on; but this Way of
arguing from them is, in my Opinion, as convincing
as any thing can be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I will come to another Argument, and
this is drawn from the Mi&s;&s;ion of the Holy Gho&s;t:
The Godhead and Glory of Je&s;us Chri&s;t the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI>
is in nothing more manife&s;t than in &s;ending the Holy
Spirit, which he calls <HI>the Promi&s;e of the Father:</HI>
He calls it indeed the Promi&s;e of the Father, but
it was al&s;o his <HI>own Promi&s;e:</HI> In one Place he &s;ays,
<HI>The Comforter, which is the Holy Gho&s;t, whom the</HI>
FATHER <HI>will &s;end in my Name,</HI> John xiv. 26. In
another Place he &s;ays, <HI>I will &s;end him unto you,</HI> John
xvi. 7.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is evident that it was Chri&s;t who &s;ent the
Comforter, the Holy Gho&s;t, the Spirit of Truth,
according to his Promi&s;e to his Di&s;ciples.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is openly declared &s;o by St. <HI>Peter</HI> in his
Speech to the People, <HI>Acts</HI> ii. 33. &s;peaking of the
Holy Gho&s;t, <HI>He hath &s;hed forth this, which ye now
&s;ee and hear:</HI> He (that is) <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</HI> and 'tis evi|dent
it was the Con&s;equence of his Exaltation; for it
is &s;aid in another Place, <HI>The Holy Gho&s;t was not yet
given, becau&s;e Chri&s;t was not yet glorified.</HI> John vii.
39. And in another Place, <HI>If I go not away, the
Comforter will not come unto you,</HI> John xvi. 7.
Now, What Inference can the Enemy draw from
this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>They make nothing of it, or make light
of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But we &s;ee no Rea&s;on to make light of it
for all that; we have no Argument, <HI>I hope,</HI> from
their Example.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e we had, What can they &s;ay?
Could <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> as Man, &s;end the Holy Spirit of Truth
among Men? When the Holy Gho&s;t was &s;ent, and
<PB N="334" REF="348">
had de&s;cended upon them, then indeed they were
<HI>indued with Power from on high,</HI> &s;o that on whom|&s;oever
they laid Hands they received al&s;o the Holy
Gho&s;t; but the Di&s;ciples did not &s;end it: The
&s;ending the Holy Gho&s;t was certainly the immediate
Work of <HI>God,</HI> only that he was plea&s;ed to give that
heavenly Gift by the Medium of the Apo&s;tle's Be|nediction;
and therefore &s;ome have &s;aid, that the
Holy Gho&s;t was given by the Apo&s;tles laying on
of Hands, not that it was under&s;tood to be the &s;ame
Mi&s;&s;ion of the infallible Spirit as the Power from
on High which de&s;cended from Heaven upon the
Apo&s;tles them&s;elves; but that this was only a Mea|&s;ure
of Faith, which is taken there for the Spirit,
and is tran&s;lated &s;o, being the &s;ame Spirit which is
&s;aid to be in Believers to the End of the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Had it been really the Holy Gho&s;t, as it
was given to the Apo&s;tles, then all tho&s;e that re|ceived
it would have &s;poken with Tongues, ca&s;t
out <HI>Devils,</HI> healed Di&s;ea&s;es, rai&s;ed the Dead; and,
in a Word, have wrought Miracles as the Apo&s;tles
them&s;elves did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and all their Preaching would have
been the Word of God, I &s;uppo&s;e, as we believe the
other is; becau&s;e dictated by the infallible Spirit, all
which it was not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;ending of the Holy Gho&s;t was
evidently miraculous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was &s;o, but it mu&s;t be more than miracu|lous
if Chri&s;t was not of the &s;ame glorious E&s;&s;ence
with the Father; for here is nothing but Ab&s;urdity,
Je&s;us Chri&s;t is &s;aid to be conceiv'd of the Holy
Gho&s;t, and yet here he &s;ends the Holy Gho&s;t, and
indues with Power from on High.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet he is called the Son of Man.</P>

<P>How then is the &s;trange Contradiction
to be under&s;tood? The Holy Gho&s;t &s;end God,
and God &s;end the Holy Gho&s;t! or the Holy
<PB N="335" REF="349">
Gho&s;t to over&s;hadow the Virgin to produce a Man,
and then that Man promi&s;e to &s;end the Holy Gho&s;t!
and &s;o the Holy Gho&s;t is &s;aid to produce the Son,
and yet is &s;aid again, to proceed from the Father
and the Son.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is all my&s;tetious, and yet it is all a My&s;tery
reveal'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may ob&s;erve our ble&s;&s;ed Lord is all
along called <HI>the Son of God,</HI> and he owns him&s;elf to
be &s;o; now he is properly and particularly the Son
of the Holy Gho&s;t, as is plain from the Account
of his miraculous Conception; and the Scripture
&s;ays expre&s;sly, he &s;hall be called <HI>the Son of God</HI> for
that Rea&s;on; becau&s;e he was conceived of the Holy
Gho&s;t, becau&s;e the Power of the Highe&s;t over&s;ha|dowed
her, &s;o that the Holy Gho&s;t is here called the
Power of the Highe&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

and Godhead of the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is &s;o, but I am not upon that Point now;
our Lord is called <HI>the Son of</HI> GOD there, by Virtue of
his miraculous Conception, but he in&s;i&s;ts upon his
being the Son of God in his Di&s;cour&s;e with the
<HI>Jews</HI> on another and &s;till higher and more glorious
Account; namely, His being really equal with God:
<HI>John</HI> v. 18. His being really God, <HI>John</HI> x. 33.
His being <HI>in the Father, and the Father in him,</HI> John
x. 38. <HI>I and my Father</HI> are <HI>one,</HI> ver. 30. which the
<HI>Jews</HI> acknowledge was making him&s;elf God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>So that in one Place, The Holy Gho&s;t is
his Father, and in another Place, God is his
Father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, all which, by unavoidable Con&s;equence,
and Arguments not to be repelled, illu&s;trate to us
the glorious My&s;tery of the Holy Trinity&punc; The
Holy Gho&s;t is the Father of Chri&s;t, and
the Cau&s;e of the miraculous Conception; and
that Birth is thence called the Son of God;
<PB N="336" REF="350">
the &s;ame Son proceeds from God, is one with God,
is proclaimed from Heaven to be the Son of God,
promi&s;es to &s;end upon his Di&s;ciples that ble&s;&s;ed Spi|rit
of Truth of whom he was conceived; &s;o that
here God &s;ends Chri&s;t, and Chri&s;t, after he rea&s;&s;umes
his Divine Glory, &s;ends the &s;ame Holy Gho&s;t, which,
in his Conception, is called GOD.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is my&s;terious indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But all this My&s;tery is explained in a mo&s;t
&s;ublime Manner, and made ea&s;y by the right Con|ceptions
of the Humanity and Incarnation of Chri&s;t;
and di&s;tingui&s;hing between his Human and Divine
Nature; this is that which the Scripture means
by <HI>the My&s;tery of Godline&s;s,</HI> GOD <HI>manife&s;t in the
Fle&s;h.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is remarkable that this Holy Gho&s;t did
not come upon any, while Chri&s;t was upon Earth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, it is &s;aid <HI>he breathed on them,</HI> and
&s;aid, <HI>Receive ye the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> John xx. 22.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is evident there, that it is meant he gave
them, by that Breathing, a Power to receive and to
exerci&s;e the Graces of the Spirit, and therefore he
added the Power of Binding and Loo&s;ing, which he
gave to them all by that Benediction; but it is ex|pre&s;sly
&s;aid in another Place, That <HI>the Holy Gho&s;t
was not yet given, becau&s;e Chri&s;t was not yet glorified,</HI>
John vii. 29. 'Tis evident that the Holy Gho&s;t
was not given for that very Rea&s;on, becau&s;e Chri&s;t
was not glorified: This Holy Gho&s;t is again &s;poken
of in the fir&s;t Per&s;on of Chri&s;t him&s;elf, where Chri&s;t
promi&s;es the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Spirit to his People in
the Per&s;on of the Apo&s;tle; he &s;ays, <HI>Lo, I am with
you to the End of the World,</HI> by which is plainly un|der&s;tood
the Holy Gho&s;t, &s;o that the Holy Spirit
and Chri&s;t is one and the &s;ame, and the Holy Spirit
and God is the &s;ame, and CHRIST and GOD are
<HI>one: I am in the Father and the Father in me. He

that hath &s;een me, hath &s;een the Father; I give eter|nal
Life; He that hath the Son, hath Life; I am the

as the Son of GOD, is One with GOD and with
the Holy Gho&s;t, &s;ends the Holy Gho&s;t, and gives
Eternal Life. <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as the Son of Man, <HI>knows no|thing</HI>
of him&s;elf, <HI>does nothing</HI> of him&s;elf, <HI>comes not</HI>
of him&s;elf, but is &s;ent by the Father, is le&s;s than the
Father, and does the Will of his Father, keeps his
Father's Commandments, <HI>and the like:</HI> All the&s;e are
Expre&s;&s;ions which the Scripture is full of.</P>
<P><HI>Chri&s;t Incarnated,</HI> and in a State of Humiliation,
was made of no Reputation, took upon him the
Form of a Servant, and the like; <HI>Chri&s;t ri&s;en from
the Dead,</HI> gives Power to receive all the Gifts and
Graces of the Spirit; and <HI>Chri&s;t glorified,</HI> gives <HI>the
Holy Spirit</HI> it&s;elf, the &s;ame Holy Gho&s;t, of which he
him&s;elf, as to his Incarnation, was conceived, and
by which wonderful Conception he is called <HI>The Son

they are not needful to be under&s;tood, any more
than they are intelligible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it needful to believe in Chri&s;t, and not
needful to know him? Is it Chri&s;tianity to be|lieve,
and not nece&s;&s;ary to know in whom we have
believed? The Scripture &s;ays expre&s;ly, that it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to believe in Je&s;us Chri&s;t; <HI>He that believeth
on the Son hath everla&s;ting Life; he that believeth not
the Son, &s;hall not &s;ee Life, but the Wrath of GOD
abideth on him,</HI> John iii. 35. <HI>Who&s;oever believeth in
him &s;hall not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting Life,</HI> John
iii. 16. He that believeth on him is not condemned,
<PB N="338" REF="352">
he that believeth not, is condemned already; it is
nece&s;&s;ary therefore to believe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith in Chri&s;t is certainly nece&s;&s;ary; there
are abundance of Scriptures to prove that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how &s;hall we believe in him of whom
we have not heard? The Scripture was written that
we might know Chri&s;t, and that knowing, <HI>we might
believe on him; and that believing, we might have
Life thro' his Name,</HI> John xx. 31. As it is nece&s;&s;ary
to believe in Chri&s;t, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to know him, or
el&s;e 'tis not nece&s;&s;ary to have eternal Life; for this
is Life eternal to know God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who
he has &s;ent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis al&s;o certainly nece&s;&s;ary to know Chri&s;t,
or el&s;e 'tis not nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;aved.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>How then can they &s;ay, 'Tis not nece&s;&s;ary
to know what he is? Are we to believe in we know
not what, and be &s;aved by we not who?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>That would be like the <HI>Athenians,</HI> indeed, to
build Altars to the UNKNOWN GOD.</P>

<P>Are we to pray to Chri&s;t or no?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, St. <HI>Stephen</HI> pray'd to him, <HI>Lord Je|&s;us,
receive my Spirit,</HI> Acts vii. 59.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>And the Apo&s;tles, a&s;&s;embled at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI>
pray'd to him, when they ca&s;t Lots for the Choice
of an Apo&s;tle, in the Room of <HI>Judas,</HI> Acts i. 24.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, if we mu&s;t or may pray to him, How
&s;hall we do this, if we know not who he is, or what
he is? mu&s;t we pray to him, and not know whe|ther
we pray to a God or a Man? To pray to him as
a Man, would be Popery, and wor&s;e than Popery, Rob|bery,
robbing God, and the gro&s;&s;e&s;t of all Idolatry;
and yet St. <HI>Stephen</HI> and the Apo&s;tles evidently did &s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>At lea&s;t, it would be wor&s;hipping we know
not what.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is then mo&s;t ridiculous to endeavor to per|&s;uade
us, that we need not inquire into this Matter,
and need not know at whom we have believed; it
<PB N="339" REF="353">
is all one as to &s;ay, we need not know by who or by
what we are to be &s;aved, or to whom we have
committed our &s;elves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But we do know him; we know him by the
Scriptures; the <HI>Samaritans</HI> as well as the Apo&s;tles
give a Te&s;timony to him, <HI>John</HI> iv. 42. We believe
and know that this is the Chri&s;t, the Saviour of the
World: The Apo&s;tles &s;ay, We know and are &s;ure,
that thou art the Chri&s;t the Son of the Living GOD.
Chri&s;t him&s;elf declares, <HI>I am</HI> the Chri&s;t, the Son of
the Ble&s;&s;ed: And when the Women of <HI>Samaria</HI> &s;ays
to him, I know the <HI>Me&s;&s;ias</HI> cometh which is called
Chri&s;t, he an&s;wers, <HI>I that &s;peak, unto thee</HI> AM HE:
And he adds in another Place, <HI>If ye believe not that

Scripture Evidence, from his being proved to be the

called Chri&s;t? for if we allow <HI>Je&s;us</HI> to be the <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI>
the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> the Son of GOD, you mu&s;t allow him
to be of a Divine Nature and Original, to be Real

your Meaning, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>My Meaning is thus, That as I prov'd Je&s;us

which was to come into the World; all the Prophe|&s;ies
of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> meeting and being fulfilled in his

Shiftings, and &s;training the Texts: They do not de|ny
Je&s;us Chri&s;t to be the <HI>Me&s;&s;ias,</HI> but they do not
meddle with the Que&s;tion, Whether the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> was

<SP>

him only) to be given to none but to GOD his
Father.</P>

<P>Yes, <HI>believing in him;</HI> Faith is required, and
Faith <HI>in Chri&s;t,</HI> Repentance towards God, and <HI>Faith
in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t:</HI> Now, the Scripture is ex|pre&s;s,
nothing but GOD is the Object of <HI>Faith;</HI> and
therefore Je&s;us Chri&s;t may be &s;aid here to a&s;&s;ert his
own Deity, in &s;aying, <HI>Believe al&s;o in me;</HI> making
him&s;elf an Object of Faith in Conjunction with
God; and as nece&s;&s;ary for the Support of the Souls
of his Di&s;ciples as their Faith in God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is indeed implied, but not directly
expre&s;&s;ed.</P>

<SP>

<P>'Tis as plainly expre&s;&s;ed as another Text,
a <HI>Pet.</HI> i. 2. <HI>Grace and Peace be multiplied unto you,</HI>

but of both conjunctly and united.</P>

<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is generally &s;aid, that God is the only Ob|ject

</SP>
<SP>

Father; God is the Object of Faith according to
his pre&s;ent Di&s;pen&s;ation, that is, manife&s;ting him&s;elf
to us as reconciled through a Redeemer, and &s;o
God in Chri&s;t, or God and Chri&s;t, are one entire
Object of Faith: So he conjoins him&s;elf with God
in the other Text, <HI>John</HI> xii. 24. <HI>He that believes on
me, believes not on me,</HI> but <HI>on him that &s;ent me;</HI> that

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how does this come down to the Argu|ment
in Hand?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very exactly; for if Chri&s;t be a meer Crea|ture,
how can he a&s;&s;ert him&s;elf to be the Object of
our Faith in Conjunction with <HI>the eternal God?</HI> If
he were not equal with God in the <HI>Divinity of his
Nature,</HI> it would be the highe&s;t Pre&s;umption in the
World, to make him&s;elf equal to him as the Object
of Faith; yet this he does <HI>John</HI> vi. 29. <HI>This is the Work
<PB N="344" REF="358">
of God, that you believe on him whom he hath &s;ent;</HI>
be&s;ides, 'tis a differing Faith.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>How &s;o, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, 'tis one Thing to believe a Per&s;on,
and another Thing to believe on him: We believe
<HI>Peter,</HI> and believe <HI>Paul,</HI> but we are never &s;aid
to believe in <HI>Peter</HI> and in <HI>Paul;</HI> if Chri&s;t were a
mere Man, though in the highe&s;t Throne of Ho|nour
and Excellence, yet he could not be the Object
of Faith and Tru&s;t, without an Offence to God:
To believe in Chri&s;t is to rely upon and re&s;t in him
for Salvation and Pardon: This is proper to the
Deity only, and is one Flower of his Crown; nay, if
Chri&s;t were a mere Man, we are cur&s;ed of God for
tru&s;ting in him, <HI>Cur&s;ed is he that maketh Fle&s;h his
Arm,</HI> Jer. xvii. 5. but if we are ble&s;&s;ed for our
Confidence in him, then he is more than a mere
Man; <HI>P&s;alm</HI> ii. 12. Faith centres only in God, thro'
Chri&s;t: God is the only Object of our Confidence
and Faith, e&s;pecially as Faith is di&s;tingui&s;h'd here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, we are commanded to believe his Word,
and his Prophets, <HI>Believe</HI> IN GOD; &s;o &s;hall ye be

2 Chron.</HI> xx. 2.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's the very Text that confirms my Di|&s;tinction;
you are bid to believe the Prophets, that
is, to believe what they &s;ay, and no doubt it is our
Duty to do &s;o, becau&s;e they &s;peak from GOD; but
you, are commanded to believe IN GOD, not only
to believe him when he &s;peaks, whether by Pro|phets
or otherwi&s;e, but to believe <HI>in him,</HI> which is
quite another Thing; the <HI>Devils</HI> believe Chri&s;t, but

that who&s;oever believeth in him, &s;hould not peri&s;h, but

not is condemned already, becau&s;e he hath not

John the Bapti&s;t <HI>to the Divinity of Chri&s;t;</HI> He that

God is true. He that believeth not the Son, hath ever|la&s;ting

CHRIST, <HI>the</HI> SAVIOUR <HI>of the World.</HI> And again,
Thou ha&s;t the Words of Eternal Life, and we believe
and are &s;ure that thou art the Chri&s;t, the Son of the
<HI>Living God,</HI> Or, as the Words may be read, <HI>Thou art
the Chri&s;t, the Living God;</HI> John iv. 68, 69. and in|deed,
in all the&s;e Texts it might bear the &s;ame In|ference:
How could he give Eternal Life to his
Sheep, <HI>John</HI> x. 28. Give them Power to become the
Sons of God who believed on his Name, <HI>John</HI> i. 12.
Know all Things, <HI>John</HI> xvi. 30. <HI>Now are we &s;ure
that thou knowe&s;t all Things; by this we believe that
thou came&s;t forth from God;</HI> And what can it be to
come forth from God? Whatsoever is of GOD is
GOD. But there are many more Texts which con|firm
this; I need not repeat them, you will find
them in your daily Reading; as particularly that
glorious Text where Chri&s;t declares him&s;elf to be
<PB N="346" REF="360">
the <HI>Son of GOD;</HI> and demands of the Man born
blind, whether he believed <HI>on him as &s;uch,</HI> John

Text in all the Book of God, that I remember,
that directs to believe IN or ON, or IN or ON <HI>the
Name</HI> of any Per&s;on or Thing, but the Per&s;on or
Name of God and Je&s;us Chri&s;t: It is one of the
particular Characters by which Je&s;us Chri&s;t is &s;aid to
be manife&s;t as God, and which is Part of the great
My&s;tery of Godline&s;s, namely, That he was be|lieved
ON in the World, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> iii. 16.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I under&s;tand, and I am &s;atisfied it

any con&s;iderable Difference between them? becau&s;e
&s;ometimes one is u&s;ed, and &s;ometimes the other.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>None at all, Child; the Words are the &s;ame
Thing, and in all Languages are expre&s;&s;ed by the
very &s;ame Word; particularly you, Child,(&s;peaking
to his Daughter) can, read <HI>French,</HI> look ill your
<HI>French</HI> Bible, and there you will find it is expre&s;&s;ed
both Ways by the &s;ame Word, that which we call
believe <HI>on,</HI> is &s;ometimes expre&s;&s;d <HI>in;</HI> and that
which we expre&s;s <HI>in,</HI> is there expre&s;&s;ed <HI>on,</HI> as in <HI>John</HI>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, indeed, it is plain, that it is the
&s;ame Thing to believe <HI>in</HI> Chri&s;t and <HI>on</HI> Chri&s;t, and
<HI>in</HI> the Name or <HI>on</HI> the Name of Chri&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now let the Oppo&s;ers of Chri&s;ts Divinity
tell us, if we are any where directed in Scripture to
believe in Man, or in any Creature or Thing but
God, or the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and if they cannot,
then it will be hard for them to &s;ay, that this Glory
is given to another, to a Creature; God alone is the
Object of Faith and of Wor&s;hip; but both Faith
and Wor&s;hip is given to Chri&s;t, and our Lord &s;ays,
<HI>Ye believe in GOD, believe al&s;o in ME,</HI> Mat. iv. 10.
<HI>Thou &s;halt wor&s;hip the Lord thy God, and him only
&s;halt thou &s;erve. Believe in the Lord thy God, &s;o
&s;halt thou be e&s;tabli&s;hed,</HI> 2. Chron. xx. 20. The Words
are expre&s;&s;ed alike in both Texts, for that which is
explained by our Lord him&s;elf to mean <HI>him only
&s;halt thou &s;erve,</HI> is expre&s;&s;ed, <HI>Thou &s;halt &s;erve him,</HI>
in that very Text from whence it is quoted, <HI>Deut.</HI>
vi. 13. So, <HI>Believe in the Lord thy God,</HI> is certainly
intended to mean, <HI>Believe in him alone;</HI> the Words
of King <HI>Jeho&s;haphat</HI> plainly infer &s;o much; and &s;o
of many other Texts, which it would be too long
<PB N="348" REF="362">
to repeat, and yet our Lord &s;ays, <HI>You believe
GOD, believe al&s;o in ME.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is plain enough, Sir, I think; we are to
wor&s;hip God only, and to believe in God only; and
yet we are to wor&s;hip Chri&s;t, and believe in Chri&s;t
too; How can that be reconciled?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, indeed? Who then is this Me&s;&s;ias? And
who is this Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is to be wor&s;hipped
and believed in, under the &s;ame Penalties, and by
the &s;ame expre&s;s Command, as God him&s;elf is to be
wor&s;hipped and believed in?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But may the Word Faith be given to both
the &s;everal Kinds of Believing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, we are to believe the Word of God, the
Prophets and Servants of God &s;peaking from him,
and the Works of God; and that is called Faith:
But you mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h of Faith; there is an Hi|&s;torical
Faith, that is giving Credit to, or believing the
Prophets, and the Te&s;timony that God has given of
him&s;elf, and the Works of Chri&s;t; but the Believ|ing
in God and in Chri&s;t, is a Grace, a Gift, a
Power given, and planted by the Holy Spirit of
God in the Heart; By the Mouth we make Con|fe&s;&s;ion,
but <HI>with the Heart Man believeth,</HI> Rom. x.
10. And in the foregoing Ver&s;e of the &s;ame Chap|ter,
<HI>If thou &s;halt believe in thine Heart;</HI> what follows?
<HI>Thou &s;halt be &s;aved.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you make &s;everal Sorts of Faith.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not &s;everal Sorts of Faith in God; that is but
one Faith, and of one Kind; and 'tis therefore
called, <HI>The Faith of God's Elect,</HI> Titus i. 1. and
<HI>Saving Faith;</HI> the <HI>Gift of God;</HI> and <HI>Ju&s;tifying Faith;</HI>
with &s;everal other Epithets; and the whole Chri|&s;tian
Religion is called <HI>The Faith</HI> in many Texts;
whereas believing the Word of GOD, the Prophets
of GOD, and the Being of GOD, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is quite
another Thing; the <HI>Devil</HI> may be &s;aid to have this
Faith, but none have the true Saving Faith in
<PB N="349" REF="363">
Chri&s;t Je&s;us, but tho&s;e who, as the Apo&s;tle &s;ays,
<HI>Believe in him, to the Saving of the Soul.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And who are they that believe to the
Saving of the Soul?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why tho&s;e that believe in Chri&s;t, <HI>John</HI> iii. 15,
16. <HI>For who&s;oever believes in him, &s;hall not peri&s;h, but
have Everla&s;ting Life;</HI> that is, <HI>Shall be &s;aved. Be|lieve
on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and thou &s;halt be &s;aved,</HI>
Acts xvi. 31. Ye are not of them that draw back
unto Perdition, but of them which believe to the
Saving of the Soul.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing is more plainly laid down in the
Scripture, than that Faith in Chri&s;t is required, in
order to Salvation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which, I think is a glorious Te&s;timony of
his eternal Power and Godhead; he is evidently made
the Object of our Faith, and that equally as
God; believing in him is e&s;&s;ential to our Salvation,
and has the Promi&s;e of Life annexed to it: God
him&s;elf can have no more; and tho&s;e People that will
have him be &s;uperior, or &s;ubordinate to the Father,
cannot deny but that the &s;ame Reward is given to us
for believing in him, cleaving to him, confe&s;&s;ing
him before Men, and the like, as is given for our
believing in God the Father; and the Scripture
&s;ays, that all Men &s;hould honour the Son, even as
they honour the Father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how then can the&s;e Men tell us, that it
is not Chri&s;tianity for us to inquire into this great
My&s;tery, or to know whether there is an Equality of
Per&s;ons or no? it &s;eems to me, that 'tis a mo&s;t e&s;|&s;ential
Point, that we may know how to direct our
Faith, Petitions, Homage, and Wor&s;hip.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mo&s;t certainly; it is a mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Point of
Chri&s;tianity and which we ought to be rightly in|formed
of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why then do they puzzle all our Inqui|ries
into it, with &s;o many Difficulties about the
<PB N="350" REF="364">
&s;everal Readings of the Scriptures? This is to be
interpreted &s;o, and this &s;o; This is in the Original,
and this is in &s;ome Copies, and not in others?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I take all that to be the mere Effect of ob&s;ti|nate
Unbelief; which leaving the plain and undeni|able
Con&s;equences of Things, and turning or wre&s;ting
the Scriptures to their own particular Meanings,
would &s;upport Error by challenging the Truth, and
&s;eek for Shifts and Subterfuges in the different
Readings, and doubtful ambiguous Con&s;truction of
Words to avoid the Force of plain and pungent
Texts; &s;o to le&s;&s;en the Credit of them, or leave us
un&s;atisfied of the true Sen&s;e, till they can decide
tho&s;e jarring Di&s;putes, reconcile tho&s;e Readings,
and have all their Objections an&s;wered and &s;ilenced,
which may probably be never brought to pa&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is the Rea&s;on, I &s;uppo&s;e, that they call
for Meetings of learned Men to di&s;pute and di&s;|cour&s;e
the&s;e Things, to compare the Originals, and
examine into the true Sen&s;e of the Antients in tho&s;e
Things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And when will they fini&s;h the Di&s;pute? Sup|po&s;e
all the learned Men in the World were brought
together for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, they allow it them&s;elves, that the
Di&s;pute would take up a great deal of Time, per|haps
&s;ome Years, &s;ome Ages, and I believe I might
add, that they are not &s;ure it would ever be decided,
or that they &s;hould all come at la&s;t to find out the
Weighty Truth; &s;o as to have all Contradictions
&s;ilenc'd, and put to an End.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what mu&s;t become of the Chri&s;tian
World in the mean Time?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to what, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to being at a Certainty in this mighty
Que&s;tion; Mu&s;t they lie all that while in a State of
Uncertainty? Mu&s;t they never know in whom they are
to believe? And how mu&s;t all the Chri&s;tians die who
<PB N="351" REF="365">
are called away in that Time? Mu&s;t they die in a
State of Ignorance and Uncertainty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true, indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a dreadful State are we all in! Our
Altars are all in&s;cribed to the Unknown God! Re|ligion
is all a hidden My&s;tery, a univer&s;al Blank!
and the Word of GOD a mere dead Letter; its au|thentick
Verity not e&s;tabli&s;hed, the Authority of
it not acknowledged, or the Readings of it de|termined.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor do we know which is right and which is
wrong tran&s;lated, till they &s;hall determine it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD the Stumbling Blocks are all
removed, by the Promi&s;e of Chri&s;t to &s;end the Spirit
of Truth, the Comforter, to lead us into all Truth,
and to bring all Things to our Remembrance; and
that this Spirit is a truly infallible Guide and Inter|preter
of Scripture, even more infallible than the
Pope, and he will reveal Chri&s;t to us; he has &s;aid of
this Spirit, that <HI>He &s;hall take of mine, and &s;hall &s;hew
it unto you;</HI> So that 'tis plain, we do not need the&s;e
di&s;puting Gentlemens determining of the&s;e Things
&s;o much as they imagine we do; let us &s;earch the
Scripture, and &s;eek the Guidance of the Spirit to in|terpret
that Scripture, and to guide us to the Know|ledge
of Chri&s;t, and he will guide us.</P>

<P>Pray, Sir, Which are the Scriptures
which they di&s;pute?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are &s;everal; but this is one in particu|lar
which they object again&s;t, 1 <HI>John</HI> v. 7. <HI>For there
are Three that bear Record in Heaven; the</HI> Father,
<HI>the</HI> Word, <HI>and the</HI> Holy Gho&s;t, <HI>and the&s;e Three are</HI>
ONE.</P>

<P>What do they object again&s;t that, pray?</P>

re&s;i&s;t the Force of the Words, if granted to be a
real Piece of the Scripture, and &s;o be dictated by
the infallible Spirit; and therefore they would fain

<P>They do not &s;ay they are in none of them,
do they?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, they cannot &s;ay that; but becau&s;e
they are not in all of them, therefore they would de|ny
them to be authentick; that Truth, as I told you
ju&s;t now, is like a Bla&s;t of Lightning to all the Here|tical
Doctrines, which it was written again&s;t; and they
fore&s;aw it, and could bring no other Objection but to
cavil at its being Authentick, and this is but a weak
Shift indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, what Doctrines were the&s;e Words
written again&s;t?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think I told you once before; the Go&s;pel of
St. <HI>John</HI> was particularly pointed at the Errors of
Two Per&s;ons (<HI>viz.) Ebion</HI> and <HI>Cerinthus,</HI> who even
in tho&s;e early Days of the Chri&s;tian Religion, ad|vanced
this Bla&s;phemy (<HI>viz.</HI>) That they denied the
Divinity of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and allowed him to be
only a mere Man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! was it &s;o &s;oon that this Error began?
Why then 'tis very ancient.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think it was very happy that it broke out
&s;o &s;oon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why &s;o, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e the Truth had immediately &s;o glo|rious
a Defender; being one of tho&s;e on whom the
infallible Spirit was immediately &s;hed abroad, at the
fir&s;t A&s;&s;embly of the Apo&s;tles; and on who&s;e Head
the cloven Tongues re&s;ted; the &s;ame who, with
<HI>Peter,</HI> healed the impotent Man in the Porch of the
Temple; the &s;ame Di&s;ciple who leaned on the Bo|&s;om
<PB N="353" REF="367">
of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and of whom it was particular|ly
&s;aid, that JESUS loved him.</P>

<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was it that Di&s;ciple who wrote the
Epi&s;tles?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, he wrote the Go&s;pel, and the Three
Epi&s;tles, and the Revelations; and throughout his
Go&s;pel and Three Epi&s;tles, he particularly aims, in
almo&s;t every Part of them, to e&s;tabli&s;h the Dignity
and Glory of The Son of God; calls him The Son,
The Only Son, The only begotten of God, The Light,
The God, The True God, and Life Eternal; and
particularly in this fifth Chapter of his Third Epi|&s;tle,
he hath this Expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>There are Three that
bear Record in Heaven;</HI> or, as others under&s;tand
it, <HI>there are Three in Heaven that bear Record;</HI>
which, indeed, I take to be the better Reading.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold; pray, Sir, do any read it &s;o? I think
that explains the Words very much to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, the learned Annotators, both in the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and the <HI>French,</HI> allow it to read be&s;t &s;o; tho'
our vulgar Tran&s;lation is as you &s;ee.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, pray go on with your Objection

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do they prove it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>All they have to &s;ay, is, that it is not to be
found in all the Manu&s;cript Copies of this Epi&s;tle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>If they could have proved it was not in the
Original Epi&s;tle, written by the Evangeli&s;t's own

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Or in none of the fir&s;t Copies; but to &s;ay
it is not in all of them, that's &s;aying but little again&s;t
it, methinks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>They can do neither of the&s;e; I'll give you
the utmo&s;t of what they have to &s;ay:</P>
<P><PB N="354" REF="368">
1. They tell us, it is left out in <HI>&s;everal Manu&s;cripts;</HI>
that is, as I &s;aid ju&s;t now, that it is not to be
found <HI>in all of them.</HI></P>
<P>2. That &s;everal of the Fathers who wrote again&s;t
the Here&s;y of <HI>Arius,</HI> do not make u&s;e of this
Text; which, they &s;ay, being &s;o clear a Te|&s;timony
of the Divinity of Chri&s;t, they would
not have failed to have taken the Advantage of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>There &s;eems to be &s;ome Weight in tho&s;e
Things too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, Son, I think not; I think a Cau&s;e is
but very &s;orrily defended, that has nothing but &s;uch
mi&s;erable Negatives to oppo&s;e to the Evidence of a
Po&s;itive Text of Scripture. If they would &s;upport
&s;uch a Ca&s;e as this in due Form, they ought to be
able to prove, that the Expre&s;&s;ion was to be found
in but a very few Manu&s;cripts, or only in &s;uch as
were mo&s;t modern; and that the Primitive Chri|&s;tians,
and the Manu&s;cript Copies of the be&s;t and
mo&s;t ancient Authority, knew nothing of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant that, indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whereas on the contrary, this Text, in the
very expre&s;s Words of it, is to be found in a great
many, nay, in mo&s;t of the Manu&s;cript Copies that
are extant, and tho&s;e of the ancient and of the be&s;t
Authority; al&s;o they are found quoted in the Wri|tings
of the mo&s;t valuable and venerable Fathers of
Antiquity in the fir&s;t Ages of the Church: <HI>For Ex|ample,</HI>
Not to &s;peak of St. <HI>Jerome, Fulgentius,</HI> and
many others, who wrote in the fourth Century again&s;t
the Here&s;ies of <HI>Arius</HI> &s;ince the Council of <HI>Nice;</HI> but
to go back beyond them all, the famous St. <HI>Cyprian,</HI>
Bi&s;hop of <HI>Carthage,</HI> and a glorious Martyr of the
Primitive Times, who lived a little above 100 Years
after the Evangeli&s;t St. <HI>John,</HI> and who &s;uffered Mar|tyrdom
in the Year CCLVIII. after Chri&s;t; I &s;ay, St.
<PB N="355" REF="369">
<HI>Cyprian</HI> quotes this Text expre&s;ly, in his Book of
<HI>The Unity of the Church;</HI> and <HI>Tertullian,</HI> more an|cient
&s;till than he, mentions and in&s;i&s;ts upon it, in
his Book called, <HI>Adver&s;us Praxeam;</HI> or a <HI>Di&s;pute
again&s;t</HI> Praxeas.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Age did <HI>Tertullian</HI> live in?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>He flouri&s;hed about the End of the &s;ame
Century, in which St. <HI>John</HI> died, being not above
Eighty Years after the Evangeli&s;t wrote this very
Text; for <HI>Tertullian</HI> wrote his Apology for the
Chri&s;tians in the Year 199 or 200.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is truly ancient enough; do they
name one Writer of equal Antiquity or Authority,
who has taken no Notice of it; or any Manu&s;cript
Copies before their Time, in which this Ver&s;e was
not to be found?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>No, no,</HI> None at all, nor any after them for
near 200 Years: Since then, nothing can be offered
again&s;t the Credit of Two Authors of &s;uch undoubt|ed
Sincerity, and that both of them acknowledge
and quote this Text, Shall it be any ju&s;t Objection
again&s;t the Scripture, to &s;ay that &s;ome modern Wri|ters,
perhaps tainted with the Here&s;y of the <HI>Ebion|ites,</HI>
or Favourers of <HI>Arius,</HI> and of much le&s;s Re|putation,
have thought fit to omit it, or wilfully to
leave it out?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, indeed, I think 'tis of no Force at all,
if it has no better Authority than that; for this may
be no more than to &s;ay, that if <HI>Arius</HI> had written
a Comment upon this Epi&s;tle, he would have left it
out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ju&s;t thus &s;tands the Authority of this Text;
which I think is not at all &s;haken by any Sugge&s;tions
of modern Writers, while we have the Authority
of &s;uch as tho&s;e more ancient, and of &s;o much bet|ter
Fame.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, as the&s;e Men are full of Cavils, Have
they nothing to &s;ay again&s;t tho&s;e ancient Authors?
<PB N="356" REF="370">
I have heard &s;ome of them boa&s;t, that they are
able to take off the Force of all tho&s;e ancient Fa|thers
very much.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, they have abundance of Cavils upon
this Part of the Subject, and indeed have little el&s;e;
much Cavil, little Argument: Their Objections are
too many for your hearing in our ordinary Di&s;cour&s;e,
and &s;ome of them too trifling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! Sir, do not &s;ay &s;o; if they are not
too tedious for you, they cannot be &s;o for us: In|&s;truction
cannot be bought too dear; the &s;earch|ing
thus into ancient Things is out of my Reach,
but I know you will bring it all down to our Un|der&s;tanding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>The quoting tedious Things in antient Wri|ters
may be difficult and long, but the Inferences
are &s;hort, and the Conclu&s;ion from it is plain; you
will under&s;tand them readily enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope we may, Sir; if I do not, I &s;hall
ask you to explain Things as you go on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will name you &s;ome of their Objections
again&s;t the Authority of this Text.</P>
</SP>
<P>1. They tell us, as I &s;aid before, that this
Pa&s;&s;age is not in the <HI>Greek</HI> Manu&s;cripts, or Oriental
Ver&s;ions of the New Te&s;tament; but this is fully
an&s;wered by a late Learned Author, Mr. <HI>D. Martin,</HI>
who tells us tho&s;e Manu&s;cripts are erroneous in many
other places, and he gives a long Variety of Omi&s;&s;i|ons
in them, &s;o that they are not to be depended
upon one way or other; but he adds, that there is
an <HI>Armenian</HI> Ver&s;ion, re-printed at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI>
about Sixty Years ago, taken from the be&s;t Manu|&s;cript
Copies of the Ea&s;t, and which the Enemies
of this Doctrine acknowledge to be very good; and
there the Text is plainly &s;et down; &s;o that it is
found in the Copy, carefully collated with the be&s;t
Editions, and only left out in Copies which have
<PB N="357" REF="371">
left out other very material Things as well as
that.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>All this is ea&s;y: I that under&s;tand no|thing
of Antiquity, under&s;tand this well enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then they object, 1. That the Councils of
<HI>Nice</HI> and <HI>Sardica</HI> made no mention of this Text.
2. That &s;everal ancient Commentators upon Saint
<HI>John's</HI> Epi&s;tle, have pa&s;&s;ed it over in Silence, and
take no Notice at all of it. 3. That the <HI>Greek</HI>
and <HI>Latin</HI> Fathers have omitted it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not &s;ee into that; What does their
omitting it prove? Do they &s;ay any thing again&s;t it,
or do they deny it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, not a Word; they only do not mention
the Ver&s;e, when they had no Occa&s;ion for it; &s;ome
were &s;peaking upon one Subject, &s;ome of another,
and all were generally pointed at <HI>Arius,</HI> who&s;e
particular Error was denying the Divinity of Chri&s;t;
whereas this Text was particularly brought to a&s;&s;ert
the coeval Godhead of the Holy Spirit, which
<HI>Arius,</HI> at that Time, did not meddle with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it a&s;&s;erts the Godhead of Chri&s;t
too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true, and we u&s;e it upon that Ac|count,
becau&s;e our Modern Here&s;y extends to
both; but <HI>Arius</HI> was not, at lea&s;t not yet, gone
that Length that our People go.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you mentioned St. <HI>Cyprian</HI> and <HI>Ter|tullian,</HI>
who were exceeding antient, and who both
of them acknowledge this Text; I wi&s;h you would
tell us, what they have to &s;ay again&s;t them; they are
Men the Church has always had in great Venera|tion,
and if they acknowlege it, I &s;hould think the
Objections ought to be very weighty that &s;hould
&s;hake their Evidence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it ought indeed, but far from that, their
Objections are &s;o trifling, that it apparently &s;hews
<PB N="358" REF="372">
they are plung'd into inextricable Difficulty, by the
Force of tho&s;e Authors; I will mention the Objecti|ons
in &s;hort, and refer you to an Author who has
hitherto been unan&s;wered for the re&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Is that Author a Prote&s;tant or
a Roman?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would have been the &s;ame thing, <HI>for</HI> the
Roman Church (whatever they are in other Points)
are very found in this, and that univer&s;ally.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know it, and therefore I think if a Pro|te&s;tant
Divine a&s;&s;erts it, 'tis liable to the le&s;s Ex|ception;
for they tax the <HI>Romans</HI> with taking it
only upon Tru&s;t, that is implicitly, on the Faith of
the Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I need not be a&s;hamed of the Author,
it is the &s;ame I mentioned ju&s;t now, the truly Learned
and Reverend Mr. <HI>David Martin,</HI> Mini&s;ter of the
<HI>French</HI> Church at <HI>Utrecht,</HI> and who has written large
and critical Annotations upon the whole Bible,
which he publi&s;hed by Order of the States, al&s;o he
has written a <HI>critical Di&s;&s;ertation</HI> upon this very Sub|ject,
proving fully this Text of the Seventh Ver&s;e
of the Fifth Chapter of St. <HI>John</HI> to be Authentick,
which Work, I &s;ay, has never yet been an|&s;wered;
I have the Book here, and will leave it
you for your further In&s;truction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am mighty glad of &s;uch a Book, Sir;
but I beg you will plea&s;e, for our Direction (who
are Children) to read us &s;uch a Part of it as you
will direct us to look upon, &s;uitable to our Capacities,
and to this particular Ca&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will do &s;o, if you have Patience for it;
and Sum it up for you, and leave you to read it at
large, at your Lei&s;ure: Fir&s;t then, to the Objection
that the Seventh Ver&s;e is not to be found in the
<HI>Greek</HI> Manu&s;cripts of the New Te&s;tament, the Ob|jection
is laid down boldly thus:</P>
<P><PB N="359" REF="373">
&startq;That this Text is no where to be found in the
<HI>Greek</HI> Manu&s;cripts of St. <HI>John's</HI> Epi&s;tle.&endq;</P>
<P>This Author an&s;wers, (1.) That as this Pa&s;&s;age
has ever been in the <HI>Italick</HI> Ver&s;ion, even as antient
as the Fir&s;t and Second Century, the Compilers
of the &s;aid <HI>Italick</HI> Ver&s;ion mu&s;t either have put it
in of their own Heads, which is too ab&s;urd to be
advanced, and cannot be proved; <HI>or</HI> they mu&s;t
have tran&s;lated it from the <HI>Greek,</HI> in which Lan|guage
the holy Evangeli&s;t wrote it.</P>
<P>To this he adds; That St. <HI>Jerom,</HI> who lived in
the Clo&s;e of the Fourth Century, who revi&s;ed and
corrected the old <HI>Italick</HI> Copies, applied him&s;elf to
throw out the principal Faults which had &s;tolen into
the Manu&s;cripts, and this he did by &s;trictly ex|amining
the <HI>Greek</HI> Copies, and he left this Text in
his corrected Work; &s;o that it is plain (adds he)
we have the <HI>Greek</HI> Manu&s;cripts on our Side, and
tho&s;e the mo&s;t Ancient.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>You need not &s;ay this Author has not been
an&s;wered; What an&s;wer it it po&s;&s;ible to give to &s;uch
Rea&s;oning?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, hear him a little further however.</P>
<P>&startq;If, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> when the <HI>African</HI> Bi&s;hops drew up
their famous Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith, the Pa&s;&s;age of
St. <HI>John,</HI> which holds &s;o con&s;iderable a Place
there, had not been in the <HI>Greek</HI> Copies of the
New Te&s;tament, they could not have urged it,
without a &s;evere Cen&s;ure: The <HI>Arians,</HI> who un|der&s;tood
<HI>Greek</HI> too well to be impo&s;ed upon, would
have exclaimed loudly, that they had quoted
Scripture which was not to be found in their
Bibles.&endq;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be &s;ure they would; I think, nothing
can be plainer than that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has another Pa&s;&s;age as clear as that, taken
from one R. <HI>Simon</HI> a Learned Man, but a great
Oppo&s;er of this Text, and one, &s;ays he, from who&s;e
<PB N="360" REF="374">
Writings <HI>the&s;e Clamours principally</HI> proceed. This
Author wrote a Book called <HI>A Critical Hi&s;tory of the
New Te&s;tament,</HI> in which he has the&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>In one Place he &s;ays, <HI>&startq;This Pa&s;&s;age is in very
few</HI> Greek <HI>Manu&s;cripts.&endq;</HI></P>
<P>In another, <HI>It is not in the Generality of the Greek
Copies.&endq;</HI></P>
<P>In a Third, <HI>It is only in the mo&s;t modern</HI> Greek
<HI>Copies.&endq;</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then, it &s;eems, he owns that it is in &s;ome
of them, though but in <HI>a Few.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and that (<HI>&s;ays Mr.</HI> Martin <HI>very well</HI>)
is a full An&s;wer to tho&s;e who a&s;&s;ert peremptorily,
That it is in none of 'em; and then he adds the&s;e
&s;ignificant Words:</P>
<P>&startq;What Mr. <HI>Simon</HI> &s;ays, that 'tis only in the
mo&s;t modern Manu&s;cripts, would do him no Ser|vice
<HI>&s;hould we grant it;</HI> but, on the contrary, 'tis
certain the Text is found in Manu&s;cripts of the
highe&s;t Antiquity.&endq;</P>
<P>After this he goes on to prove his A&s;&s;ertion, and
does it mo&s;t unan&s;werably, as you will &s;ee in Four
Pages together, <HI>viz.</HI> Page 54, 55, 56, 57. But one
Example is very particular: About 300 Years ago
(<HI>&s;ays he) Laurentius Vallo,</HI> a Nobleman of <HI>Rome,</HI>
and of va&s;t Learning for the Time he lived in, was
the fir&s;t who made Enquiry after the <HI>Greek</HI> Manu|&s;cripts
of the New Te&s;tament. He got into his
Hands Seven, a Number at that Time very con&s;i|derable:
The Pa&s;&s;age of St. <HI>John</HI> was in all the
Seven; &s;ome of tho&s;e Manu&s;cripts were of Four or
Five hundred Years &s;tanding, which, added to the
Three hundred Years pa&s;t &s;ince, amount to, at lea&s;t,
Seven or Eight hundred Years, &s;o that the <HI>Greek</HI>
Manu&s;cripts, in which the above-named Mr. <HI>Simon</HI>
&s;ays it is wanting, is more modern than tho&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think there is no need of any more Evi|dence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="361" REF="375">
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But he brings a great many more <HI>for all that,</HI>
&s;uch as <HI>Era&s;mus, Edward Ley,</HI> a Learned Oppo&s;er
of <HI>Era&s;mus,</HI> Cardinal <HI>Cajetan,</HI> Cardinal <HI>Ximenes,
R. Stephens,</HI> the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Louvain,</HI> Father <HI>Ame|lotte,</HI>
and &s;everal more be&s;ides, all referring to divers
ancient Manu&s;cripts of the <HI>Greek</HI> New Te&s;tament,
which have all of them this Clau&s;e; and he tells us
where tho&s;e Manu&s;cripts are to be found, as parti|cularly
in the <HI>French</HI> King's Library, and the King
of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia's</HI> Library at <HI>Berlin;</HI> in the <HI>Vatican</HI> Li|brary,
and &s;everal others, for which, I &s;ay, I refer
you to the Book it&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think we need not enquire any farther
into that, 'tis too plain for any thing that can be
offer'd to overthrow it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis evident the Ver&s;e is in the mo&s;t authen|tick
<HI>Greek</HI> Copies, even back to Per&s;ons almo&s;t con|temporary
with the fir&s;t Pen-man, the ble&s;&s;ed Evan|geli&s;t
him&s;elf; Now if it is in the fir&s;t Copies, it will
pa&s;s for &s;ufficient Evidence that it was in the Ori|ginal,
and if in the Original, it is Canonical Scrip|ture,
and that's enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what have they to &s;ay again&s;t <HI>Tertullian,</HI>
and St. <HI>Cyprian?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly nothing; nothing of Weight, or that is
material, 'tis all but mi&s;erable Cavilling: They pre|tend
that <HI>Tertullian</HI> does not quote the Text, only
&s;peaking upon the Subject of the Trinity recites
the Words, <HI>The&s;e Three are One,</HI> as his own Words,
and not as a Quotation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But where had he the Words then? And
how came he to &s;peak ju&s;t the &s;ame Words? And
how do they prove he did not refer to them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Reverend Author, who&s;e Book I have
here undertaken to defend <HI>Tertullian</HI> by, &s;hews
that it was ordinary to repeat Texts of Scripture,
without quoting or referring to Chapter and Ver&s;e,
and he gives two Examples, exactly agreeing with
<PB N="362" REF="376">
<HI>Tertullian,</HI> one from St. <HI>Cyprian,</HI> and the other from
<HI>Gregory Nazianzen,</HI> but I refer you to the Place,
<HI>Pages</HI> 49, 50.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what do they &s;ay again&s;t St. <HI>Cyprian?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly as little, and Mr. <HI>Martin</HI> confutes that
little too, very plain, and, as I think, unan&s;werably,
Pages 44, 45.</P>
<P>1. They would have it that St. <HI>Cyprian's</HI> Works,
as we have them, are altered in &s;everal Places.</P>
<P>2. They &s;ay the holy Martyr's Words relate to
the next Ver&s;e of St. <HI>John, The Spirit, the Water,
and the Blood.</HI></P>
<P>To both the&s;e, I &s;ay, he gives clear An&s;wers:
To the Fir&s;t he &s;ays, If it were &s;o, it does not ap|pear
that this Part was ever altered in the lea&s;t, and
that there was no Manu&s;cript of St. <HI>Cyprian</HI> to be
produced which has not the very Words, without
any Alteration at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, if they cannot prove that this Pa&s;&s;age
was altered, 'tis nothing at all to the Purpo&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to the Second, 'tis a meer Fallacy, and
Mr. <HI>Martin</HI> proves it to be &s;o, and brings &s;everal
Evidences to prove that St. <HI>Cyprian</HI> meant this very
Ver&s;e, and no other; one of the&s;e is <HI>Fulgentius</HI> Bi|&s;hop
of <HI>Ru&s;pe,</HI> who, writing again&s;t the <HI>Arians,</HI>
quotes St. <HI>Cyprian</HI> at large: His Words are the&s;e;
&startq;This the ble&s;&s;ed Martyr St. <HI>Cyprian</HI> has withal ac|knowledged,
writing in his Epi&s;tle concerning the
Unity of the Church thus, <HI>It is written of the FA|THER,
the SON, and the</HI> HOLY GHOST, <HI>that the&s;e
Three are One.&endq;</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think, Sir, we need no farther Rea&s;on|ing
upon it, the Words were certainly St. <HI>John's,</HI>
and are a Part of the Word of God, there is no
room to deny it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you &s;aid &s;omething, Sir, of another
Text in this latter Epi&s;tle, wherein the &s;ame Saint
<HI>John</HI> a&s;&s;erts the Godhead of Chri&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="363" REF="377">
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did &s;o, and it is a very remarkable Place,
'tis in the 20th Ver&s;e of the &s;ame Chapter, the
Words are the&s;e; <HI>We are in him that is true,</HI> even
<HI>in his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t: This is the</HI> TRUE GOD, and
<HI>Eternal Life.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does the Text intend, or are we to under|&s;tand
it, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the True God, and
Eternal Life?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think it is clear that we &s;hould under&s;tand it
&s;o; but to give you a better Authority than mine, if
your Si&s;ter will look into her <HI>French</HI> Bible, &s;he will
find it tran&s;lated thus, <HI>Even in his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t:</HI>
Making a Stop there, he, as it were, begins again
thus; <HI>He is the True God,</HI> and <HI>Eternal Life.</HI></P>

<P>It is &s;o indeed.</P>

thus; <HI>Son fils</HI> JESU CHRIST;
<HI>il e&s;t le Vrai</HI> DIEU &amp; <HI>la Vie
Eternalle.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But to confirm it &s;till farther, and in which
both Tran&s;lations agree, he is in the &s;ame Ver&s;e
called the Truth, or <HI>him that is True,</HI> where God is
fir&s;t called <HI>Him that is True,</HI> and then Je&s;us Chri&s;t
is called by the &s;ame Title; &s;ee the Text: <HI>We
know the Son of</HI> GOD <HI>is come,</HI> and <HI>hath given us an
Under&s;tanding,</HI> that we may know <HI>Him that is True:</HI>
Note, that is to know GOD, as the next Words will
prove, <HI>viz. And we are in him that is True;</HI> even,
(or, as the <HI>French</HI> read it, THAT IS TO SAY) <HI>in his
Son</HI> JESUS CHIST HE <HI>is, or</HI> WHO <HI>is, the True</HI> GOD,
and <HI>Life Eternal.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am &s;urprized at this Explanation,
but 'tis plain the <HI>French</HI> Tran&s;lators do read it
&s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, I think, our Tran&s;lation is as plain,
that Ju&s;us Chri&s;t is here called <HI>Him that is True,</HI>
ju&s;t as GOD is called <HI>Him that is True,</HI> the very &s;ame

becau&s;e the very Nature of the Thing is again&s;t
them, if the Scripture is to be &s;earched, and the
Scriptures do &s;ufficiently te&s;tify of Chri&s;t, as our Sa|viour

good Spirit of Truth, the Guide and Comforter of
his People, who our ble&s;&s;ed Lord promi&s;ed to &s;end,

&s;till in the Dark, and has not led us at all into the

his Word, that the Promi&s;e of the Father is

<P>Till the&s;e learned Ca&s;ui&s;ts have met from
all Parts of the World, have con&s;ulted all the differ|ing
Opinions, compared the differing Readings of
every di&s;puted Text, and a&s;certained tho&s;e Things
which, it &s;hould &s;eem, the infallible Spirit of God
either could not, or, at lea&s;t, has not thought fit

that this ble&s;&s;ed Spirit may fully and e&s;&s;entially re|veal
Chri&s;t to us; which Prayer, &s;incerely put up
in the Name of Chri&s;t, and in the Faith of the Pro|mi&s;e
which our ble&s;&s;ed Lord made to us, That he
would <HI>&s;end his Spirit to us,</HI> that it &s;hould <HI>be with us
to the End of the World,</HI> we may &s;afely depend

<HEAD>The CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>THE anxious Parent of this well in&s;tructed
Family, having ended the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es; and,
as he had Rea&s;on to believe, with Succe&s;s, he left the
Book of the Reverend Mr. <HI>David Martin</HI> with them,
for their farther Direction; folding down the
Leaves at the proper Places, which he had recom|mended
to their Reading.</P>
<P>When he was going away, he recollected that he
had made a &s;erious Poem upon the very Subject
which he had been di&s;cour&s;ing of (<HI>viz.</HI>) The Deity
of Chri&s;t; and pulling it out of his Pocket, he read
it to them, being in Blank Ver&s;e, after the Manner
of Mr. <HI>Milton.</HI></P>
<P>His Children were &s;o plea&s;ed with it, that they
begg'd him to leave that with them too, for their
more lei&s;urely Reading, which accordingly he did,
and I have therefore in&s;erted it here, as a Conclu&s;ion
to the Work, as follows.</P>
