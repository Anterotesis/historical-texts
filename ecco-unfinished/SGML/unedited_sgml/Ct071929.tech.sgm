<HEAD>A Fourth ESSAY
At Removing
National Prejudices.</HEAD>
<P>I Had not proceeded to di&s;cour&s;e any further on the Sub|ject
of the Union, tho' I have had the Honour to have
my la&s;t E&s;&s;ay received with an Approbation I could not
expect, had I not found the Objections &s;o many, &s;o ill ground|ed,
and &s;ome of them &s;o injurious to Truth, that I thought
it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay &s;omething to them.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry to &s;ee <HI>Scotland</HI> impo&s;ed upon, and well-mean|ing
People po&s;&s;e&s;t with Prejudices by things, which really are
put upon them by the Enemies of their general Peace; and
in which not <HI>England</HI> only but them&s;elves are daily ill
treated.</P>
<P>For this rea&s;on I am once more in Print on this Subject,
and beg to be heard with patience, in order to remove Pre|judices;
and as I &s;hall endeavour to merit a favourable
Cen&s;ure, while I pur&s;ue Truth, &s;o I &s;hall ask no favour if I
for&s;ake it.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t E&s;&s;ay I laid down four Heads, in which the &s;e|veral
&s;ub&s;tantial Parts of the Union between the two King|doms
con&s;i&s;t; and <HI>as I &s;tudy Brevity,</HI> I only repeat here the
Heads, and how far I have proceeded to con&s;ider them apart.
<LIST>
<PB N="4" REF="3">
<HEAD>The Heads are,</HEAD>
<ITEM>1. Trade.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Religion.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Civil Government: In which I reckon is
contain'd Succe&s;&s;ion, which I call the 4th.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I have touch'd at the fir&s;t, fini&s;h'd what I have to &s;ay on
the &s;econd, and by the nece&s;&s;ity of the Scheme come now to
&s;ay &s;omething to the la&s;t.</P>
<P>The end of that E&s;&s;ay is to remove the radicated Prejudices
of both Nations again&s;t the Union of the Kingdoms on all
the&s;e Heads.</P>
<P>My whole De&s;ign is, to handle it like a Subject of U|NION;
to treat of Peace with Pa&s;&s;ion, is one of the mo&s;t
ridiculous things in my apprehen&s;ion in the World, incon&s;i|&s;tent
with its Nature, and perfectly contrary to the De&s;ign:
And I am very &s;orry to &s;ee any Author of a contrary Opi|nion.</P>
<P>I would have <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England</HI> agree like Nations that
may differ, and differ like Nations that may agree: Calm
Rea&s;oning is the be&s;t Step to right Di&s;cerning, and nothing
but want of Temper can make our Di&s;agreement fatal.</P>
<P>Not that I can &s;ugge&s;t &s;uch weak things of either Nation,
as to think this Treaty can fall; and I own to &s;ee &s;uch Pru|dence
of Method, Fairne&s;s of Debate, Lea&s;ure and Caution
in Proceeding here, as I cannot think any thing can mi&s;car|ry
in &s;uch hands, which &s;hall conduce to the Nations Bene|fit
in particular, and the whole I&s;land's Satisfaction.</P>
<P>As for the Imprudence of the Street, 'tis none of my Bu&s;i|ne&s;s;
I pity the poor ignorant People, who&s;e eyes are not
always open to their own Happine&s;s: I hope they will not pro|voke
the Government to any Severities; and if they have
but patience, I doubt not, but like &s;ome of their Brethren in
<HI>England,</HI> they will be made happy again&s;t their wills.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4">
I find, as I come to remove Prejudices, I &s;hall meet with
&s;ome of the Popular Objections, which in Print have &s;allyed
out from <HI>England</HI> hither; and if I attempt to overturn them, I
hope I &s;hall meet with no wor&s;e Treatment, than I give; and I
freely remit my Method, as well as my Opinion, to the Pub|lick
Cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Head I am now upon, is, That of Civil Govern|ment;
in which I am to Examine a little the Terms of the Uni|on,
the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of it, the Advantages to both Nations,
and the Objections again&s;t it.</P>
<P>By the Union, the Civil Affairs as to Government in
<HI>Britain,</HI> are to be Devolved upon one and the &s;ame Re|pre&s;entative,
for the true end of all Government, the <HI>Public
Good,</HI>&mdash;And as the Nation is to be United into One, their
Public Good mu&s;t have an Equal and Impartial Re&s;pect to
all the parts, or it cea&s;es to be Con&s;onant to its Name, the
<HI>Public Good.</HI></P>
<P>And here I meet with a great deal of Cavil, from &s;e|veral
Authors, and particularly from a Book &s;aid to be
wrote by one Mr. <HI>H</HI>&mdash;s, again&s;t the Notion of the two
Kingdoms becoming One; I &s;hall not enter the Li&s;t with a
Man of Mr. <HI>H&mdash;ges</HI> Voluminous Character, nor Direct this
Tract as a Di&s;pute again&s;t any Body; but it &s;eems needful to
me to Examine here, whether both are not a little mi&s;taken
in their Notions, of the two Kingdoms being brought to be
one Nation, having one Intere&s;t, one Heart, and one Inclina|tion,
<HI>Enquiry Pag:</HI> 25.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>H</HI>&mdash;s, in his Reflection on this, &s;ays the Author of
the <HI>Enquiry,</HI> In&s;inuates by it, &startq;That a Total Coalition of
the two Kingdoms, &s;hall certainly Annihilate and put an
end to their different National Intere&s;ts, and Con&s;olidate
them into one Common Intere&s;t of both, <HI>p: 3. par:</HI> 5. to go
one with this, he &s;tates the Controver&s;ie thus; that the <HI>Enquiry</HI>
Affirms, <HI>That by a Coalition their different Intere&s;ts are to
<PB N="6" REF="5">
become one, without Di&s;tinction.</HI>&endq; And on the contrary, Mr.
<HI>H&mdash;s,</HI> &startq;That no Coalition, nor any other po&s;&s;ible means,
can ever Unite all their di&s;tinct National Intere&s;ts INTO
ONE Common Intere&s;t, without Di&s;tinction.&endq;</P>
<P>I mu&s;t Confe&s;s, this &s;eems to me, to be the mo&s;t trifling
Di&s;pute that ever I have met with, between any Men of
Con&s;ideration in this Nation; and its evident to me, that
both their A&s;&s;ertions are equally true, both Erroneous,
and yet both Reconcilable to one another, and particularly
both Motives to, and Explications of the Union; and a &s;mall
attempt to enter into the nature of the thing, will bring both
the&s;e Gentlemen to be of the &s;ame mind; and both their Ar|guments
may, if the Gentlemen them&s;elves plea&s;e, be Recon|ciled
in that one main thing THE UNION.</P>
<P>The Union of the Kingdoms, its true, does not re&s;olve all
their National Intere&s;ts into <HI>One and the &s;ame,</HI> either Mathe|matically
and Numerically one, or Nationally one, and &s;o if
the Enquiry be made to &s;peak Literally <HI>he is wrong,</HI> for Ex|ample,
there is not an Onene&s;s in their Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Intere&s;ts,
as the two Churches, who&s;e Rights are &s;everal, and their In|tere&s;ts
&s;everal and re&s;erv'd: There is not an Onene&s;s in their
re&s;pective Admini&s;trations of Ju&s;tice, which in re&s;pect to the
&s;everal Nations, are different in Manner, in Place, and in all
the Methods of Admini&s;tration, and &s;o of the &s;everal other in|&s;tances,
of which Mr. <HI>Hodges</HI> is very bountiful in the particu|lars,
I mu&s;t own, <HI>I</HI> think to very little purpo&s;e, becau&s;e real|ly
'tis a Nicety of no manner of &s;ignification.</P>
<P>But if, Gentlemen, there be an Union, and a Samene&s;s in
the General Intere&s;ts of the Nations, with re&s;pect to the&s;e ve|ry
heads, <HI>I</HI> think 'tis plain, there is <HI>an Onene&s;s of Intere&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>For Example, there is not an Onene&s;s of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Inter|e&s;ts,
as to the re&s;pective Principles of the Churches, as <HI>Epi&s;|copel</HI>
and <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> but there is an Onene&s;s of their General
<PB N="7" REF="6">
Intere&s;ts <HI>as Prote&s;tant;</HI> and it will for ever Unite their Inter|e&s;ts,
&s;o as to make them one Body, with one general Inter|e&s;t,
again&s;t all &s;orts of Super&s;tition, Athei&s;m, Idolatry, Popery,
Heatheni&s;m, and the like Common Enemies of the Prote&s;tant
Religion; and their different Intere&s;ts, as Epi&s;copal and Pre&s;|byterian
being re&s;erv'd, will have no influence, <HI>I am &s;ure need
not, nor ought not,</HI> to interrupt their General Intere&s;t, Mutual
Defence and Protection again&s;t tho&s;e Common Enemies.</P>
<P>Thus for a further Example, their different Admini&s;trations
of Ju&s;tice, are re&s;erv'd out of this Onene&s;s, and it is the Inte|re&s;t
of both Nations, that they be admini&s;tred in their own
&s;eparate manner, in their re&s;pective Kingdoms, by their pro|per
Judges, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And what Ob&s;truction is this to the <HI>Onene&s;s
of the General, viz.</HI> That Ju&s;tice be equally and effectually
admini&s;tred? <HI>This is the general Intere&s;t of the Whole,</HI> and
becomes &s;o by the Union, and is no more interrupted by the
Coalition, than the re&s;pective Privileges of &s;everal Burroughs
and Corporations in <HI>England,</HI> who Hang and Draw within
them&s;elves, and who re&s;erve to them&s;elves to be exempt from
coming to <HI>London</HI> to the Sovereign Courts, or have Judges of
their Own, as in <HI>Wales, Chester, Durham,</HI> and the like, hin|der,
that <HI>England</HI> has all their National Intere&s;ts <HI>&V;nited into
One.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The End of all is,</HI> That Ju&s;tice be impartially admini&s;tred,
and the Re&s;erve of Places or Per&s;ons makes no manner of
Breach in the <HI>&V;nity of Intere&s;ts,</HI> and this I think, will bring
Mr. <HI>H&mdash;s</HI> and the Enquirer together, to mean the &s;ame
thing, or be both mi&s;taken: <HI>Let them make the Choice.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>H&mdash;s</HI> to make good his Point like other Di&s;pu|tants,
when they have weak Arguments, runs into one of
the wor&s;t &s;ort of Unhappine&s;&s;es that a Man who claims fair
Arguing can fall into, and that is, want of Truth&mdash;and to
make good a weak A&s;&s;ertion, a&s;&s;umes a fal&s;e one. I am &s;orry
<PB N="8" REF="7">
to &s;ay a thing &s;o &s;evere of a Gentleman, I am a Stranger
to, and who once de&s;erv'd well of this Kingdom; but 'twill
be my Station in this E&s;&s;ay, to oppo&s;e nothing but direct Pre|&s;umptions
and A&s;&s;ertions without Truth.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. He affirms, That whatever Agreement is now concluded
between the two Kingdoms, will never be binding to the
New Parliament.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That the two Kingdoms effectually &s;ubject them&s;elves to
the New Parliament, all the Conditions &s;tipulated on ei|ther
&s;ide to the contrary in any wi&s;e notwith&s;tanding.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The&s;e are hard things to alledge again&s;t a whole Nation,
and can have no Ground but a radicated Prejudice. The
Parliament of <HI>Britain</HI> are &s;trangely repre&s;ented here, and I
think I need &s;ay no more, than what I have &s;aid already.</P>
<P>The Foundation of that Parliament, is, this Treaty; to &s;ay,
They will not be bound by it, is to &s;ay, they will pull them|&s;elves
up by the Roots: they dye when the Union receives a|ny
mortal Wound, and this Con&s;titution Doctrine, over|throws
all the Notions of what the Parliament may do again&s;t
you.</P>
<P>They can not infringe one Article of the Union; they can
not put a Que&s;tion in the Hou&s;e upon any one Article.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen have in&s;inuated here, That they may think
fit to bring <HI>Epi&s;copacy</HI> into <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>I take upon me to affirm, They cannot put that Que&s;tion in
the Hou&s;e.&mdash;If any Man &s;hould move it, they can not enter
on the Debate; they &s;hake their own Foundation in the very
Thought; every Motion is an Earthquake under the Pillars
of the Hou&s;e, and the moment they &s;hould do it, they like
<HI>Sam&s;on</HI> pull the Hou&s;e down upon their own Heads.</P>
<P>The Parliament of <HI>Britain,</HI> cannot enter into an Enquiry
whether they are a Parliament or no; for their being a Par|liament,
only gives them power to be there. Now, how
<PB N="9" REF="8">
will they come to be a Parliament?&mdash;and enquiring into this,
will bring me to another Ab&s;urdity of Mr. <HI>H&mdash;s, viz.</HI> That
this Union is an entire di&s;&s;olving the Con&s;titution of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
and &s;urrendring it bound Hand and Foot into the ab&s;olute
Di&s;po&s;e of the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> This is &s;uch a Contradiction, and &s;o
plainly clear'd by the Treaty, that no Man can think &s;o
roughly, but he that on purpo&s;e &s;huts his eyes again&s;t his Rea|&s;on
I'll &s;tate it by way of Que&s;tion and An&s;wer; the Cate|chi&s;m
is &s;hort, let no man be loth to learn it.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is it constitutes the Parliament of <HI>Britain?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The &V;nion. <HI>Let any Man give another An&s;wer to it if he can.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How is it con&s;tituted?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By Treaty <HI>between two Nations by their Heads and Repre|&s;entatives,</HI>
viz. <HI>the Queen and Parliament of each Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How do they bring it to pa&s;s?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By mutually di&s;&s;olving their re&s;pective Con&s;titutions, and
forming one general Con&s;titution upon a Treaty of Equalities
and Equivalents; the Stipulations of which Treaty are agreed
to be the Con&s;tituent Part of the &s;ub&s;equent Body.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> &V;pon what Right doth the pre&s;ent re&s;pective Parliaments depend?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The Natural Right of the Free-holders of both King|doms,
which entitules them by the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Lands
to have the free Exerci&s;e and Power of making the Laws by
which they are to be governed.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Does this new Con&s;titution de&s;troy that Right?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Not at all, but re&s;erving that Right, which indeed it
cannot de&s;troy, agrees to limit the Exerci&s;e of it by &s;uch and
&s;uch Forms, and on &s;uch and &s;uch Conditions, which Con|ditions
are the Limitations of the Power of the new Parlia|ment,
as being the Act and Deed of the old Parliaments,
who&s;e Con&s;titution was founded on Original Right.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9">
I think this Connexion is plain and very ju&s;t; and as it
will admit no Objection, &s;o it however brings me to the next
Thing of Cour&s;e, which the other Gentlemen are driven to
by the nece&s;&s;ity of the Argument.</P>
<P>And that is, That the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and
by con&s;equence of <HI>England</HI> too, have not a Power to go into
this Union&mdash;And <HI>H&mdash;s</HI> &s;ays p. 62. &startq;That 'tis not in the
Power of the <HI>Scots</HI> Government to conclude &s;uch an Union
without a manife&s;t Violation of Tru&s;t, and without doing
a manife&s;t Act of Inju&s;tice, Oppre&s;&s;ion and U&s;urpation a|gain&s;t
the Fundamental Rights and Liberties of this free
Nation.&endq;</P>
<P>This is Pleading to the Juri&s;diction of a Court, which in
all Ages all Courts of Ju&s;tice, tho Inferiour far to Parliament,
do not allow; and the Parliament or Government of <HI>Scot|land</HI>
needs not at all, that I &s;hould defend or explain what
they have or have not power to do.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall &s;peak two things here&mdash;<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> How ab&s;urdly
do the&s;e Men argue! They will not allow the Parliament of
<HI>Scotland</HI> can break into the Con&s;titution, or meddle with
Fundamentals; and yet they will have it be, that the Parlia|ment
of <HI>Britain</HI> &s;hall have Power to undo its own Foundation,
and break the Articles of Union, by which it is to have its
Being. This is not fair Dealing at all.</P>
<P>But a little help will reconcile all this: It is mo&s;t true, and
I grant it readily, That the Government of no Nation can
take away the Original Right of the People; and I am per|&s;waded
the Parliament will not take it ill, if I &s;ay, they can|not
make a Law, that the Free-holders of <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hall not
have a Right to be governed by their own Laws, that is a
Voice in the making them, by Repre&s;entatives, and enjoy the
Liberty of their Per&s;ons, Property of their Lands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10">
But &s;hall it therefore follow, they &s;hall not have Power to
determine the Circum&s;tances of the&s;e things, which are the
Con&s;equences of a Repre&s;entative; as how many they &s;hall be
repre&s;ented by, who has a Right to be repre&s;ented, and who
not, and the like?</P>
<P>To bring this home, 'tis not in the Power of Parliament to
di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s any Free-holder, without Conviction of a Crime
committed of his Right of being repre&s;ented; and yet
'tis in the Power of Parliament to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s all the
Burghs, Towns, Cities and Corporations in <HI>Britain,</HI> of their
Right of being repre&s;ented at all.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;on is plain; the Right of a Free-holder is an Ori|ginal,
'tis claim'd by his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which is to be trac'd
back to God Almighty's fir&s;t Donation, when he gave Man
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Earth to him and his Heirs, and bid him po&s;|&s;e&s;s
and &s;ubdue it <HI>Gen.</HI> 1&punc; that is, Govern it; from whence
'tis ea&s;y to deduce the Right of all Government in the World,
to depend upon the Legal Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;olid, <HI>Anglico,</HI> the
Free-hold&mdash;If any &s;ingle Man was able to purcha&s;e, and
had purcha&s;ed all the Land in <HI>Scotland,</HI> he would be King by
Divine Right; he would be him&s;elf the whole Parliament by
Natural Con&s;equence, and the whole Power of Legi&s;lature
would be in him&s;elf.</P>
<P>But the Right of the Towns and Corporations is a conce|ded
Right granted to them either by the Cu&s;tom of the Nati|on,
permitting the Monarch, or by Gift of the Free-holders,
which Gift may be re&s;um'd by the &s;ame Parliamentary Au|thority.</P>
<P>And there are In&s;tances of this in memory, when the Par|liament
of <HI>England</HI> have &s;u&s;pended a Town from &s;ending
Repre&s;entatives for a whole Se&s;&s;ion; as the Town of <HI>Maid|&s;tone,
Anno</HI> 1704, the Town of&mdash;in the &s;ame Year;
and a Debate long in the Hou&s;e, and I think a Bill brought
<PB N="12" REF="11">
$nto the Hou&s;e once about the Year 1697, to deprive the
Burrough of <HI>Stockbridge</HI> of their Claim of being repre&s;ented in
Parliament.</P>
<P>As then the Parliament have Power to take away the Right
of Towns, they have a Right al&s;o to pre&s;cribe the Number
of Per&s;ons by whom the Free-holders are to be repre&s;ented;
and if this be not &s;o, I de&s;ire to know, how the Number
came at fir&s;t to be &s;ettled.</P>
<P>But to go further, I would ask, If the Parliament have
not power to divide one County into two or more, when too
large, or join them when too &s;mall? If this be doubted, I
could give &s;everal In&s;tances of it in <HI>England,</HI> as of <HI>Richmond|&s;hire,</HI>
which is now join'd to <HI>York-&s;hire,</HI> and only repre&s;ented
by the two <HI>York-&s;hire</HI> Members.</P>
<P>If any Man &s;hall doubt, whether the Free-holders are
fairly repre&s;ented when their Number is reduc'd. I &s;hall
an&s;wer, 'Tis not the fewne&s;s of Per&s;ons cho&s;en, which deno|minate
a Repre&s;entative&mdash;but the freedom of Choice: If
every Free-holder has his Voice in the Election, he is as du|ly
repre&s;ented in two, as two hundred; And <HI>York-&s;hire,</HI>
which is twenty times as large as <HI>Rutland-&s;hire</HI> in <HI>England,</HI>
choo&s;es but two Knights of the Shire, and is as compleatly re|pre&s;ented
as the other.</P>
<P>Thus 'tis plain, the Parliament mu&s;t be allowed to judge
of the Circum&s;tances of that Right, which they cannot di&s;|&s;olve.</P>
<P>And this brings me to that Great Que&s;tion, on which this
whole Affair turns; and for want of examining which right|ly,
much of this Clamour among us is unhappily rai&s;ed, <HI>viz.</HI>
Whether this Union is a Limiting the Circum&s;tances of
Native Right, or a compleat Di&s;&s;olution overturning and re|&s;igning
the Native Right it &s;elf?</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="12">
Mr. <HI>Hodge</HI> affirms in a multitude of Places, and with
unu&s;ual A&s;&s;urance, That to Incorporate with <HI>England,</HI> is a
compleat re&s;igning up the National Freedom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> Pag.
63, 58, 62, 16. and in divers other Places; and to Illu&s;trate
it when he would fain bring it to interfere with the National
Covenant he brings this admirable Simily &s;utable to his u&s;ual
way of Arguing.</P>
<P>He alleges, That taking a National Oath, obliges the
&startq;<HI>Scots</HI> to keep them&s;elves a di&s;tinct Nation, and after quib|ling
with the Word, <HI>National,</HI> he puts a Ca&s;e, Whether a
Man bound by Oath to the well Managing his Affairs, or
about &s;omething relating to the Management of his own
Affairs, can without fal&s;ifying his Oath, quite the Manage|ment
of his own Affairs, and commit them wholly to the
di&s;po&s;al of another?&endq;</P>
<P>Now, I'll appeal to all the World, whether he had not
more exactly &s;uted the Purpo&s;e, if he had thought fit, to have
&s;tated it thus, Whether a Man bound by Oath to the be&s;t
Management of his Affairs, may not without fal&s;ifying that
Oath, join with another for his Help and A&s;&s;i&s;tance, in order
to the better Management of tho&s;e Affairs?</P>
<P>To &s;ay, 'tis re&s;igning his Intere&s;t to the ab&s;olute Di&s;po&s;al
of the other, becau&s;e Govern'd by a Majority, is fir&s;t, Fal&s;e in
Fact; &s;econdly, Lame in Argument.&mdash;'Tis fal&s;e in Fact,
in the Ca&s;e before us; for where there is a Treaty and &s;tipu|lated
Conditions, there can be no ab&s;olute Di&s;po&s;al, 'tis a
Contradiction, and nothing can bring that Article to bear,
but &s;aying, <HI>The Major Part may Tyrannize.</HI> 'Tis therefore
Lame in Argument, for if we are arguing the Legal Founda|tion,
'tis no Argument at all to &s;ay, That Foundation may
be illegally broken, but it can not be legally broken: The
Parliament of <HI>Britain,</HI> is to be &s;aid, not to be able to do
what they cannot legally do.&mdash;If Mr. <HI>Hodge</HI> re&s;olves to have
<PB N="14" REF="13">
it &s;o, that they &s;hall be all Thieves, Robbers, and meer Mo&s;s
Troopers, <HI>I cannot help that;</HI> he &s;hall have it &s;o if he will,
and then indeed they are not fit to be United with at all, and
his <HI>Foederal &V;nion</HI> will be as Lame as t'other; But I appeal
to all judicious Men, whether in Point of Argument, 'tis not
to be allow'd to &s;ay, They cannot do, what they cannot
legally do, what they cannot do without Inva&s;ion, Oppre&s;|&s;ion,
and Tyranny?</P>
<P>Three Men go in Partner&s;hip in Trade, they draw up Ar|ticles,
Incorporate their Stocks and proceed to Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>'Tis conditioned between them, that Majority of
their Voices, &s;hall in all things decide any Di&s;pute, and
Govern in the di&s;po&s;ing their Stock, and carrying on their
Trade.</P>
<P>Now, does this give any Two of the Partners a Power to
Vote, that the Third &s;hall leave his Stock to them, and have
no &s;hare of the Trade? this would be Robbery and Cheat,
and the Man would Plead his Articles.&mdash;The meaning of
the Partner&s;hip is overthrown, which was for mutual Profit,
not to Cheat one another, the Articles are broke, and the
Man has a Right to &s;et up by him&s;elf as he was before.</P>
<P>All the Error therefore of the&s;e People, ari&s;es from this
Notion, that the Original Right of the Free-holder, to be
repre&s;ented, is given up, which is manife&s;tly Fal&s;e, it being
retain'd in all its Exerci&s;e, only the Circum&s;tance of the Re|pre&s;entative
altered, which by Mr. <HI>H&mdash;s</HI> Rule, mu&s;t be
committed to the Parliament by their Con&s;tituents, &s;ince (as
he &s;ays) <HI>The Con&s;tituent cannot Limit or Re&s;train his Repre&s;en|tative,
but hands him all the Power he him&s;elf enjoys.</HI> P. 62.</P>
<P>The Treaty of Union between the Nations, is of mutual
Incorporation, Coalition and Conjunction, which is a Com|munication
of Privileges, Advantages, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The true mean|ing
is, not that one &s;hould be Slaves to the other; &s;hould
<PB N="15" REF="14">
<HI>England,</HI> under the Shelter of a Majority of Voices, attempt the
En&s;laving <HI>Scotland,</HI> and a&s;&s;ault the Articles of Stipulation, In|vade
the Treaty, and break in upon the Conditions by Vio|lence.&mdash;The
Con&s;equence is plain, the Partnerships is
broke, the Union is di&s;&s;olv'd of Cour&s;e, and the Invaders be|come
Tyrants and Oppre&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>To Argue then, that it is po&s;&s;ible, is not to the pur|po&s;e,
I have &s;poken to it already in the la&s;t E&s;&s;ay, and it needs
not to be repeated; The Que&s;tion is, Whether it can be le|gally
done?</P>
<P>As to the Arguments brought to prove it probable, that
<HI>England</HI> &s;hould impo&s;e upon <HI>Scotland;</HI> what I have hitherto
&s;een, are very &s;trange Ones, and &s;uch as I am loth to repeat,
they are &s;o un&s;utable to two Si&s;ter Nations Treating of Union,
that I really wonder at the Gentlemen that publi&s;h them.</P>
<P>Such as,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That <HI>England</HI> will be bound by no Conditions.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That the Parliament of <HI>Britain,</HI> will &s;ubject you with|out
any regard to the Treaty.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That two e&s;tablish'd Churches are Incon&s;i&s;tent:</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. That <HI>England</HI> is a Nation too Wicked to join with, and
that you will take upon you the Guilt of their Natio|nal
Crimes.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. That if you agree to Equivalents, they will Cheat you,
for they will never pay you the Money&mdash;and the
like.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>To &s;upport the&s;e mo&s;t abominable Practices, they advance
horrid Forgeries, plain and ea&s;ie to be Contradicted.</P>
<P>For Example, Mr. <HI>Hodges</HI> p. 60. affirms, &startq;That the Sa|cramental
Te&s;t, is that whereby all People are to qualify
them&s;elves for making them capable to be Members of Par|liament,&endq;
according to the Law of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>And to Exaggerate this, he goes on; &startq;This Law &s;o re|maining
unaltered, the fir&s;t thing the <HI>Scots</HI> Members are
<PB N="16" REF="15">
pre&s;ented with at their coming up to their New Parliament
is the Sacramental Te&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If they take it, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> What becomes of the Kirk of <HI>Scot|land?</HI>&endq;
If they refu&s;e it, who mu&s;t &s;upply their Places?</P>
<P>Had the Gentleman wrote this in <HI>Scotland,</HI> where he might
have wanted Information, either from Men or Books, he
might have made &s;ome tolerable Excu&s;e for thus impo&s;ing
upon the World; and a Man would have been apt to have
pa&s;t it over lightly: but to write this at <HI>London,</HI> and pre|tend
to be acquainted there, to pretend to give Characters of
the Place, the People, and their Sins, and yet fall into a Sin,
few there but him&s;elf would be Guilty of.&mdash;What &s;hall I &s;ay,
for &s;uch a Man?&mdash;'Tis an ungrateful Office to be always
raking in the <HI>Lay-&s;talls</HI> of Mens Extravagancies; and I do
not love the Employment; But who can help detecting a
thing, when he tells a Tale, a Man may feel with his foot, and
brings &s;uch open Fal&s;ities upon the Stage of the World, that
the Children in the very Street can contradict?</P>
<P>To &s;ay, the Members of Parliament take the Te&s;t, 'tis all
one as to &s;ay, the Tide flows into <HI>Edinburgh</HI> Ca&s;tle, or a Fleet
of Sheep &s;ail'd over <HI>Coldingham</HI> Muir, 'tis what was never
heard of in <HI>England;</HI> and if I &s;hould tell in <HI>England,</HI> that &s;uch
a thing had been Printed and Publi&s;hed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> they
would be very hard to believe me.</P>
<P>On the other hand, 'tis horribly treating <HI>Scotland</HI> her &s;elf,
and impo&s;ing upon the Gentlemen there in a manner they
ought to take very ill.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I take it upon me to &s;ay, 'Tis utterly Fal&s;e, and
God knows the Author's de&s;ign in a&s;&s;erting it; there is no
&s;uch Law in <HI>England,</HI> as requires the Members of Parliament
to take the Sacramental Te&s;t, nor ever was; and I dare under|take
to Name to this Author, &s;everal Gentlemen in <HI>England,</HI>
in every Se&s;&s;ion, that have been Members of Parliament that
<PB N="17" REF="16">
never took the Sacrament in the Church of <HI>England</HI> in their
Lives: And <HI>Alderman Love,</HI> who &s;erv'd about 20 years for
the City of <HI>London;</HI> and al&s;o was in the Hou&s;e when that
Act was made, is one of them.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;ure your &s;elves Gentlemen, there neither is, nor ever
was any &s;uch thing in the Hou&s;e, and I tru&s;t never will.&mdash;And
'tis plain, when in but two Parliaments ago, one <HI>Are&s;|dale</HI>
a Quaker, was cho&s;en a Member for the Burgh of <HI>High|wickham,</HI>
he came to the Hou&s;e, but refu&s;ed to take the Oath,
as a thing again&s;t his Principle; and it was Debated in the
Hou&s;e, whether his Affirmation could be taken in &s;tead
of his Oath, but pa&s;t in the Negative. Now Gentle|men,
had it been a refu&s;al of the Sacramental Te&s;t, it would
never have admitted a Debate in the Hou&s;e, whether he
&s;hould have been receiv'd without it, for they could not
have done it.</P>
<P>This is one of the Forgeries impo&s;ed upon <HI>Scotland,</HI> by the
Enemies of her Tranquillity, and a certain Demon&s;tration,
that they &s;uffer a Famine of Argument, and are forc'd to
have recour&s;e to a Refuge, that no Man of Honour can bear
the Thought of.</P>
<P>Then Gentlemen, you mu&s;t not Unite with us, for we are
a Wicked Notorious People, <HI>Sodom</HI> was a Fool to us, and
GOD will plague you for our National Sins.</P>
<P>This is a horrid Bla&s;phemous Sugge&s;tion upon the Divine
and Immutable Ju&s;tice, as well as an unaccountable Reflecti|on
upon <HI>England;</HI> and this, as it is Extravagant in it &s;elf, I
beg the Reader to take notice, how Unhappily, I mean, as to
his own Reputation, the Author has founded his Argument
here.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. He believes it, becau&s;e he heard a Godly Man there
Confe&s;s it in his Prayer.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="18" REF="17">

no manner of &s;en&s;ible Alteration in <HI>England.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>As to what a Mini&s;ter in his Warmth of Confe&s;&s;ion, about
National Crimes, might &s;ay, 'tis but a &s;orry Foundation, as
to Argument: But I'll lay it more fairly down, and I'll con|fe&s;s
for <HI>England,</HI> that 'tis a Sinful Nation, and perhaps there
are Greater Sins there, than here. I'll grant it, whether &s;o or
no; I believe both have yet cau&s;e enough to lay by the Pha|ri&s;aical
Method of <HI>&s;tand off, I am more Holy than thou,</HI> and ap|ply
our &s;elves to General, National, and Per&s;onal Reforma|tion.</P>
<P>But give me leave to Detect the Author of this Libel, for
I can call it no other, in One thing as to Reformation.</P>
<P><HI>England,</HI> Bad as &s;he is, is yet a Reforming Nation, and I
prove it by the very thing this Author accu&s;es her of&mdash;The
Work of Reformation has made more Progre&s;s in <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
from the Court, even to the Street, than I believe any
Nation in the World can parallel in &s;uch a time, and in &s;uch
Circum&s;tances: Let any Man look back to the days of K. <HI>Ch.</HI>
the 2d. when Rampant Vice ouer-run that Court; when all
&s;ort of Lewdne&s;s &s;pread the Face of Authority; let them view
the Royal Example of the late Glorious Pair K. <HI>William</HI> and
Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> how Vice learnt to Blu&s;h, and being Bani&s;h'd
from Court by the Royal Example, Virtue and Good Man|ners
became the Mode there: Let them look into the Ex|amples
now Reigning, and tell me what Crime is Encourag|ed
by Her Maje&s;ty: Is it nothing to Dethrone the Devil, and
Depo&s;e his reigning Agents? di&s;arm the Factors of Hell, and
Bani&s;h rampant Vice?&mdash;Let them look at what Strength,
Crime was arriv'd to in <HI>England,</HI> by the help of &s;ome Mo|narchs;
<PB N="19" REF="18">
<HI>Scotland ought not to blame</HI> England <HI>for,</HI> and com|pare
what &s;he is, to what she was.</P>
<P>Let this Gentleman plea&s;e <HI>Next</HI> to look back to the late
General Bent of the Land, to Univer&s;al Drunkne&s;s, when a Per|&s;on
of Quality would like no Servant, nor a Servant like a
Ma&s;ter, that would not be Drunk; when a Man would not
think him&s;elf Welcome at my Hou&s;e, if I did not make him
Drunk, nor believe I thought my &s;elf Welcome at his, if he
did not make me Drunk.</P>
<P>If the&s;e Vices are in their extremes Dethron'd, then <HI>England</HI>
is in the right Way; and 'tis hoped by an Union, you will
help us forward to Reformation.</P>
<P>The Societies for Reformation, which this Gentleman
Scandalizes, are another Proof of his Ignorance of <HI>England,</HI>
and his Inju&s;tice to that Nation; the Advances they have
made, <HI>Are not &s;en&s;ible,</HI> &s;ays he. I a&s;&s;ure you, they are very
Sen&s;ible to every one that plea&s;es to Examine what Havock
they have made with Street-lewdne&s;s; how they have rooted
out the Stews and Fountains of Publick Vice; How they
have erected Charity Schools, and cau&s;ed Numbers of Va|grant
and Poor Children, who would have been left to the
Street, and to all manner of Vice, and perhaps &s;ome to the
Gallows, to be taught better Manners and Religion, in&s;truct|ed,
and <HI>in Contradiction to Mr.</HI> Hodges <HI>A&s;&s;ertion, CATE|CHISED;</HI>
in &s;hort, well brought up, carefully put out to
Trades, and Great Sums of Money applyed to do it, and &s;o
at la&s;t introduc'd into the World in a Religious and &s;ober
manner, and &s;aved from Ruine, Soul and Body. And I do
a&s;&s;ure him, there are above 1500 of the&s;e Children now un|der
their Care in <HI>London</HI> only, Cloth'd, Taught, Catechi&s;ed,
and In&s;tructed at their Charge.</P>
<P>I could fill a large Hi&s;tory of the Progre&s;s of this Society,
and of the perpetual Methods they take, both with Poor and
Rich, to Di&s;countenance all kinds of Vice; and how really it
<PB N="20" REF="19">
does Di&s;countenance it, to the Honour of the Prote&s;tant Re|ligion,
and the Glory of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation in particular;
but this is enough <HI>to detect a Slanderer.</HI></P>
<P>I might &s;earch Hi&s;tory a little, and re-mind you, how that
when K. <HI>Charles</HI> propo&s;ed this very Union, in the year 1669,
The Duke of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> in his Speech, told the Parliament, That
the King had now offered them a Treaty; and in de&s;cribing
what kind of Treaty it was, he tells them, &startq;That the many
Meetings on former Treaties, produc'd no Effect, unle&s;s it were
a Conviction of the Difficulty, if not impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;etting
it in any other way,&endq; than by a nearer and compleat &V;nion
of the two Kingdoms, Hi&s;tory of <HI>England,</HI> Vol. 3. Fol. 275, 276.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry to &s;ee &s;uch a general Rumage made for Rea&s;ons,
why the Union &s;hould not be made: But I confe&s;s, I am
glade to &s;ee the Objectors driven to <HI>&s;uch Shifts for Argument,</HI>
that they mu&s;t make u&s;e of Forgery, Fal&s;ity, Slander, and
Reproach.&mdash;I am &s;ure, the&s;e things will go but a little
way with Wi&s;e Men: The Nature of a Fal&s;ity is to expo&s;e
it &s;elf, and at la&s;t its Author, and always leaves the Cau&s;e
<HI>'tis brought to Defend,</HI> wor&s;e than it found it.</P>
<P>It remains to enquire,&mdash;What are the &s;everal
Intere&s;ts that Pre&s;s this Union? And where had the
fir&s;t Thoughts its Birth, who are they &s;eek it, and for
what De&s;ign? Becau&s;e 'tis alledged, that 'tis propo&s;ed by
no Body that are Friends to <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>But I &s;hall go no further back for it, than King <HI>William;</HI> and
here I &s;hall ob&s;erve, <HI>England</HI> never propo&s;ed it to you, but
when &s;he her &s;elf was under the Be&s;t, the Wi&s;e&s;t, and the
mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Conduct that ever &s;he was in, as in the days
of King <HI>Edward</HI> 6. and King <HI>William;</HI> when ever we have
been under the Eruption of Popery and Tyranny we never
inclined to Unite with you; but when ever Love, Charity&punc;
and Moderation prevail'd, we have always inclin'd to Peace
and Coalitions.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="20">
I doubt, tho&s;e Gentlemen, who charge this as a Plot in
<HI>England,</HI> to devour <HI>Scotland,</HI> forget, that in the Revolution
the E&s;tates of <HI>Scotland</HI> were the fir&s;t and earne&s;t Movers of
the very manner of the Union, as now treated of. Tho&s;e
very Gentlemen that under the Influence of that Glorious
Head King <HI>William</HI> had their eyes open to the Nations true
Intere&s;t, that re&s;tor'd the Liberty and Religion of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
that &s;aw clearly the Intere&s;t both of the Church and State;
tho&s;e very Men in their Letter to King <HI>William,</HI> were the fir&s;t
that (His Maje&s;ty having in his fir&s;t Letter mentioned it
in general) de&s;cended to de&s;cribe, what &s;ort of an Union
was be&s;t for this Nation, and tell the King they &s;hould be
glad of an Union, provided it were &s;o and &s;o.</P>
<P>And I cannot but look back to this Circum&s;tance, to open
the eyes of &s;ome Gentlemen who are too forward to &s;ay, It
was never propos'd by tho&s;e that wi&s;h'd well to <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>King <HI>William</HI> was the fir&s;t Propo&s;er of it in our time, and
that in his very fir&s;t Letter to the Convention of E&s;tates of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> and the fir&s;t Letter of the E&s;tates to His Maje&s;ty,
<HI>then not received King of</HI> Scotland, declares an Union to be

in their &s;econd Letter, when the Crown of <HI>Scotland</HI> was offer|ed
to King <HI>William,</HI> the E&s;tates have this Expre&s;&s;ion:</P>
<P>&startq;We are mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible of Your Maje&s;ty's Kindne&s;s and

what Face now can the&s;e Men call this a Contrivance of the
Enemies of <HI>Scotland?</HI> I am per&s;waded the Author is a great|er
Enemy to <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England</HI> in this Particular, than any
of tho&s;e Noble Patriots of their Country were, who at the
Revolution made that Offer.</P>
<P>It is plain, no other &V;nion than this is practicable between
the Nations: They talk of their Federal &V;nion; and this Au|thor
&s;ays, He can offer one, but re&s;erves it <HI>in petto</HI>&mdash;The
Wi&s;dom of both Nations have determin'd this to be not the
be&s;t, but the only foot to make a &s;afe Treaty upon: And I
mu&s;t own upon the &s;tricte&s;t Examination I can make, I &s;ee
neither Safety, Advantage or Satisfaction in any of their o|ther
Propo&s;als to either Nation.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. H.</HI> ... gives us a Li&s;t, as he calls it, of one and twen|ty
interfeiring Intere&s;ts, in oppo&s;ition of the Enquirer's, &s;aying,
We &s;hould have but one Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>To me this is mo&s;t &s;trange Cavilling: I'll allow him dif|ferent
Intere&s;ts; and yet I may affirm for the other &s;ide,
there may be but one National Intere&s;t: And I can give him
innumerable interfereing Intere&s;ts in one Part of <HI>England,</HI> with
another, and yet <HI>England</HI> may be &s;aid to have but one Nati|onal
Intere&s;t, which the whole is &s;ub&s;ervient to.&mdash;</P>
<P>Now 'tis a Que&s;tion I have often put in private Conver&s;a|tion,
and could never yet get an An&s;wer to.&mdash;Is there any
One National Intere&s;t in <HI>England</HI> or in <HI>Scotland,</HI> that is incon|&s;i&s;tent
with another National Intere&s;t in the other Kingdom;
and that <HI>being &s;o,</HI> makes the Union nece&s;&s;arily impracticable
without one Side or other being oppre&s;t?</P>
<P>Let me pur&s;ue this Enquiry, for much will depend upon
it to di&s;&s;olve the Probabilities a&s;&s;um'd by the&s;e Authors a|gain&s;t
the Parliament of <HI>Britain</HI> pre&s;erving the Union.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="22">
Pray, Gentlemen, let me enquire into this Head, Why the
Parliament of <HI>Britain</HI> &s;hould oppre&s;s <HI>Scotland,</HI> and in what?
Which are the National Intere&s;ts that will cla&s;h and prompt
the Parliament to be partial, and oppre&s;s you?</P>
<P>The Church Intere&s;ts cannot be the thing, for they are re&s;|pectively
&s;ecur'd, or will be &s;o in the Body of the Treaty,
which Treaty <HI>as before</HI> the Parliament cannot touch, nor
put a Que&s;tion about.</P>
<P>As to the Laws, they are re&s;erv'd in each Country, and,
the Courts of Ju&s;tice already &s;ettled, are to remain &s;o.</P>
<P>To &s;ay, The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Lawyers will be for bringing up all
your Suits at Law to <HI>London,</HI> to bring them Bu&s;ine&s;s, is an
Ab&s;urdity in the Nature of it, and not worth notice. 'Tis
plain, the Law in <HI>England</HI> is not brought to the Lawyers, but
the Lawyers are fain to turn itenerat, and ride a Cau&s;e job|bing
over the whole Nation; the Judges go Circuites, and
Ju&s;tice is carried home to every Man's door: no Man is
bound to &s;ue or be &s;ued, plead or be impleaded, but in the
County where he lives; no Man &s;hall be tried for Murther,
but in the County where the Fact was committed. And a
famous Robber not now 3 Months &s;ince, obtaining to be tried
at the Old Bayly for a Robbery, was found guilty of the
Robbery, but as committed in the County of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and ef|cap'd
the Gallows by it, becau&s;e a Jury in <HI>Middle&s;ex</HI> could
not condemn him for a Crime committed out of the County;
and they could not carry him down into <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> becau&s;e the
Law &s;ays, <HI>No Man &s;hall be tried twice for the &s;ame Fact.</HI></P>
<P>Shall then the <HI>English</HI> in meer &s;pleen to the <HI>Scots</HI> alter the
whole Scheme of Ju&s;tice? and when the Judges come down
quite to <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> to do Ju&s;tice, fetch the <HI>Scots</HI> up to <HI>London,</HI>
on purpo&s;e to be vexatious&mdash;What &s;ort of Sugge&s;tions are
the&s;e? At be&s;t, were you entirely &s;ubjected, we &s;hould &s;end

our Judges to your &s;everal Towns, as in <HI>England;</HI> or make
Judges on purpo&s;e for you, as in <HI>Wales.</HI> But <HI>England</HI> is fully
&s;atisfied and plea&s;ed to re&s;erve to you all your own Courts
and Methods of Ju&s;tice; and it can never be her National
Intere&s;t to alter it.</P>
<P>Where then are the&s;e interfeiring Intere&s;ts? they mu&s;t
lie in Trade &s;ure, or I know not where we &s;hall find them?
And I would be glad to know of the wi&s;e&s;t Objector, in
what part of Trade <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England</HI> can have <HI>as Nations</HI>
any interfeiring Intere&s;ts? I know, in <HI>England</HI> 'tis objected,
you will run into their Woollen Manufactures, and &s;o I be|lieve
you will, to buy them: But I appeal to common know|ledge,
Gentlemen, whether there is in <HI>Scotland</HI> the lea&s;t pro|pen&s;ity
that way, I mean as to a General Trade.</P>
<P>And the Rea&s;on is plain, You have no occa&s;ion for it, if
you can fall in to make your own Cloths well and good, and
you will never trouble your &s;elves &s;o much as to do that, for
you have better things before you.</P>
<P>The Linnen Manufacture on Shoar, your Fi&s;hing at Sea,
and your Plantation Trade beyond Sea, are Oceans of Wealth
you will &s;wim in, and cannot launch out too far, and in none
of the&s;e will you interfere with <HI>England,</HI> or <HI>England</HI> with you.&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>England</HI> will help you in them all, and your Wealth will
circulate thro' their hands&mdash;They immediately lo&s;e 17000 <HI>per
Annum</HI> by you in one Article, the Duty upon your Linnen, you
carry all your Linnen into their Ports <HI>free,</HI> when all other Lin|nen
pays 12, 10, 16 <HI>per Cent</HI> Duty; and' tis your own faults,
if your Linnen Trade does not employ your whole Kingdom,
as the Woollen Trade does <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Not a Nation in the World imports &s;o much Linnen of all
&s;orts as <HI>England;</HI> and if <HI>Scotland</HI> fall heartily to work upon
it, and by Directions learn to imitate the &s;everal kinds now
in u&s;e. The <HI>Dutch</HI> may have other Rea&s;ons to be again&s;t the
<PB N="25" REF="24">
Union, than the Damage of their Fi&s;hery: <HI>Scotland</HI> may with
ea&s;e Vent a Million <HI>per Annum</HI> in <HI>England</HI> in their Linnen
Manufacture.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament may renew the Duty, &s;ay the
&s;ame Gentlemen Objectors.</P>
<P>That cannot be without breach of the Union, for all Cu|&s;toms
are to be taken off between the Nations, and a free
Communication of Trade: If therefore a Tax be laid on Lin|nen,
it mu&s;t be upon all Linnen made in <HI>England;</HI> for it was
never known, that any Manufacture was tax'd in one Place,
and let free in another.</P>
<P>I cannot imagine therefore one Article, in which the Ge|neral
Intere&s;t of the two Kingdoms can cla&s;h with one ano|ther.
Let's view the &s;everal Channels of their Trade.</P>
<P><HI>England</HI> abounds in Woollen Manufactures, and the <HI>Scots</HI>
want them: <HI>Scotland</HI> abounds in Linnen, and <HI>England</HI> wants
that: <HI>Scotland</HI> has the Fund of the Fi&s;hery, the Fi&s;h, the Men,
the Harbours, the Nets; and <HI>England</HI> has thir&s;ted to fall into
that Trade for &s;everal Ages; they cannot cla&s;h there.</P>
<P><HI>Scotland</HI> has Wool, <HI>England</HI> buys all the Wool in the World,
if they'll bring it thither: <HI>Scotland</HI> has Corn, <HI>England</HI> buys
a prodigious Quantity, and &s;ends it Abroad again.</P>
<P><HI>Scotland</HI> has Coal, <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> will be &s;orry, but the <HI>Scots</HI>
Coal will never want a Market at <HI>London,</HI> while the Ladies
keep Fires in their Nur&s;eries and Chambers.</P>
<P>In all this I cannot &s;ee the lea&s;t probability of a Cla&s;h be|tween
the two Nations. And I would be glad to have any
of the Gentlemen on the other &s;ide tell us one Head of Trade,
in which it is morally probable, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Scots</HI> &s;hould
di&s;agree, interfere, or be jealous of one another. If then their
Intere&s;t agree, how can they differ? Intere&s;t reconciles all
the Enmities in the World; and no Nation but ours act
<PB N="26" REF="25">
again&s;t their Intere&s;t. If it be our mutual Intere&s;t to agree, I
cannot &s;ee why we &s;hould differ.</P>
<P>But then the&s;e Gentlemen come with a weighty Objection
again&s;t the number of the Repre&s;entatives; and the Author
of the State of the Controver&s;y, the Ob&s;ervations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and
Mr. <HI>Hodges,</HI> are all exceeding turbulent on that Head.</P>
<P>One &s;ays, 'Tis &s;ubjecting <HI>Scotland</HI> to the <HI>English</HI> Nation;
Others &s;ay, 'Tis &s;ubjecting the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> to Epi&s;co|pacy;
Others, That 'tis no &s;ufficient &s;ecurity to you. And
Mr. <HI>Hodges</HI> is very learned upon the Inequality of the Propor|tion,
and &s;ays, <HI>Scotland</HI> is not fairly repre&s;ented. My An|&s;wer
&s;hall be brief on this head, becau&s;e I think 'tis an&s;wered
in it &s;elf.</P>
<P>As to &s;ubjecting <HI>Scotland</HI> in Church and State to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Nation, I think I have an&s;wer'd it in entring before on the
nature of the Treaty, and the nature of the &s;ub&s;equent Par|liament,
in which every thing for the Safety and Liberty of
<HI>Scotland</HI> that can be demanded, is re&s;erv'd out of the Power
of Parliament; and this I undertake to join I&s;&s;ue upon when
they plea&s;e, and to defend: For where there are Conditions,
there can be no &s;ubjecting a Nation, or any Surrender of Right,
as is vainly alleg'd, they are Contradictions in their nature:
<HI>England</HI> &s;ubjects them&s;elves to the Crown, and yet <HI>England</HI>
is called a free Nation, and is &s;o: 'Tis on Condition to be go|verned
&s;o and &s;o, and the Crown is bound by it: Does <HI>En|gland</HI>
&s;urrender their Liberties, is &s;he not tenacious of them to
the la&s;t degree? How ab&s;urd is this way of Arguing?</P>
<P>That a Treaty is no &s;ufficient Security, I have fully an|&s;wer'd,
in that it cannot be broken by the Parliament, with|out
di&s;&s;olving them&s;elves, and de&s;troying all manner of Right
and regard to Ju&s;tice in their own Nation as well as in this.</P>
<P>As to the Proportion of Members, about which Mr. <HI>H&mdash;s</HI>
is &s;o very particular, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to examine a little in|to
it.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="26">
I &s;hall not enter into the Enquiry, Whether Payment of
Taxes, and the mea&s;ure of Wealth in a Nation be the be&s;t
way of determining this Matter, or no? Let Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> and
him alone to fight out that Affair, tho' as the Power of a Na|tion
is now more con&s;i&s;tent in its Wealth than People. Much
more might be &s;aid on that Head.</P>
<P>Nor will I deny, but even in <HI>England,</HI> that Part of our Re|pre&s;entative,
which relates to Burrows, is not &s;o well poized
as to <HI>England</HI> it &s;elf, as I wi&s;h it were, the Fate of Towns
Trade, and differing Providences having alter'd the Face of
that Nation very much &s;ince the la&s;t Settlement of their Re|pre&s;entative.</P>
<P>But I'll go back beyond this; Mr. <HI>H&mdash;s</HI> and I agree, That
the Inheritance carries with it the Right of being repre&s;ented,
that is of being governed by Laws of our own making; and
that this is a Right, the Heretors, or as I call them, Free-hol|ders,
cannot be dive&s;ted of, no, nor can dive&s;t them&s;elves of;
and that they are not at all dive&s;ted of it in this Parliament,
I have already prov'd.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now prove, That on this Foundation neither Lords
nor Commons in <HI>Scotland</HI> receive any real Injury in the pro|portioned
Number now &s;peaking of, and that there is no bet|ter
or more rational way of Judging.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hodges</HI> has to my hand own'd, That a Free-holder is
not to be reckon'd by the Value or by the Rent of his Free-hold
at all, but by the Poll; and a Free-holder of 40 <HI>l. per
Annum</HI> by that Law mu&s;t have as much Right to a Voice in
choo&s;ing a Repre&s;entative, as he that has 40000 <HI>l. per Ann&punc;</HI> and
in <HI>England</HI> it is &s;o.</P>
<P>Now I'll take it either way, and let any Gentleman make
an E&s;timate, either of the Value of the Free-holds, or of their
number of Free-holders in <HI>England</HI> or in <HI>Scotland;</HI> and I un|dertake
to prove, that the Repre&s;entative allotted in the
<PB N="28" REF="27">
Parliament of <HI>Britain</HI> is a full Proportion, and rather over
than under.</P>
<P>Now becau&s;e in both Kingdoms the Nobility and Knights
of the Shire are the only Repre&s;entative of the Free-hold; and
the Members of Corporations are not concern'd in it; yet as
the &s;everal Burghs or Corporations are by Grant from the
Free-hold, they may be con&s;ider'd together, as repre&s;enting
Per&s;ons qualified to be Free-holders by their Wealth, and
&s;erviceable to it by their Commerce.</P>
<P>Take then the Knights of Shires in <HI>Scotland</HI> again&s;t the
Knights of Shires in <HI>England,</HI> or take the whole 45, as if
cho&s;en by the Heretors in <HI>Scotland,</HI> againct the 513, as if
cho&s;en by the Free-holders in <HI>England,</HI> and it will appear the
Proportion is every way to the Advantage of <HI>Scotland</HI>&mdash;And
if the&s;e Gentlemen will tell us, which Handle they will take
it by, they are welcome to make the Calculate as &s;oon as they
plea&s;e.</P>
<P>The Annual rents in <HI>England</HI> are &s;uppo&s;ed to make 12 Mil|lions,
of which I account 5 Millions <HI>Sterling</HI> to be free-hold:
The number of Free-holders in <HI>England</HI> may be gue&s;t at by
examining the Poll, where we have found the Counties of
<HI>Suffolk, Kent, E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and &s;everal others, have often poll'd near
6000 Free-holders each, and <HI>York-&s;hire,</HI> as I have heard, 19000.
As to the Value of Free-holds or Numbers of Free-holders
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> I leave that to the Calculation of others.</P>
<P>And if then by either the Value of Free hold, or the number
of Free-holders in <HI>Britain,</HI> the Proportion for <HI>Scotland</HI> is ju&s;t, I
can &s;ee no room for all the Objections now made again&s;t the
Repre&s;entative, as proportioned by the Union. Indeed Mr.
<HI>Hodges</HI> his Propo&s;ition of &s;tating the Free-hold of Under&s;tand|ing,
and Choo&s;ing by the Stock of Brains, is a thing I dare not
enter into the Calculation of; I leave it to him: Nor &s;hall I
debate the Influence the Ladies have in the Union, with him;
the&s;e Matters are fit to be merry about when the Union is
over.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="28">
But &s;etting his Je&s;ts a&s;ide, I pre&s;ume to affirm, he &s;hall not
find a more &s;utable way to Determine the Proportion, than
what I have now &s;tated.</P>
<P>As to the Nobility&mdash;they are in this Sence only Capital
Free-holders, and their Original Honour began in their Ex|traordinary
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and 'tis an Honour to their Lord|&s;hips,
with their Blood to have continued tho&s;e Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.
I need therefore add nothing but this, the Proportion is the
&s;ame way to be tryed, their Lord&s;hips repre&s;ent them&s;elves,
and being by this Calculate, only re&s;train'd in Number, the
Method of determining it being left to their Lord&s;hips, their
Hereditary Honour of &s;itting in the Parliament is pre&s;um'd,
and their Lord&s;hips are compleatly repre&s;ented, when they
are not there; And withal, in lieu of the &s;mall Interruption,
the Nece&s;&s;ity of the Treaty gives them: They are as an E|quivalent
in Honour regal'd with being Univer&s;ally admit|ted
Peers of <HI>England,</HI> as well as <HI>Scotland,</HI> or in the Words of
the Treaty, Peers of <HI>Britain</HI>&mdash;the whole Nobility of the
I&s;land forming the Greate&s;t, and mo&s;t Illu&s;trious Body in the
World,</P>
<P>And I am per&s;waded, their Lord&s;hips are not &s;o Sen&s;ible
of any Di&s;honour put upon them in this Treaty, as the&s;e Gen|tlemen
Authors would per&s;wade them to be.</P>
<P>The next Head re&s;pects Equalities and Equivalents, and
this puts me back to &s;peak a little more of Taxes and Trade.</P>
<P>I cannot but wonder at the Weakne&s;s of the Objections
rai&s;ed again&s;t this Union upon the&s;e Accounts, in which to
me they &s;eem to have &s;o ill a Foundation, that either the
People who rai&s;e them, do not under&s;tand them; or if they
do, they are very forward Men, to think, that others can be
impo&s;ed upon by Arguments, &s;o ea&s;ily over-thrown.</P>
<P>I &s;hall name a few of the&s;e Scruples, for Objections I cannot
call them, and &s;peak &s;hortly to them.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="29">
1. They tell us, The Lands will &s;ink in Value, a My&s;tery
form'd in the Heads of &s;ome, that certainly have no Concern
in the Lands, or do not under&s;tand them: And I'll only
An&s;wer it by one Note. Suppo&s;ing the Lands were not to
be Improv'd in their Value at all&mdash;the very Security of the
Title of Land in <HI>Scotland,</HI> a Thing &s;orely wanted in <HI>England,</HI>
will immediately upon an Union, rai&s;e the Values of Land, at
lea&s;t two years Purcha&s;e; and I prove it by the We&s;t-riding of
<HI>York-&s;hire,</HI> the only County in <HI>England,</HI> that has obtain'd a Re|gi&s;ter,
&s;ince which, and in about Eight or Nine Years,
the Lands in that Divi&s;ion, are advanc'd near Five Years Pur|cha&s;e
in the Value, only for the Security of a Title.</P>
<P>This is ju&s;t like Telling the Soldiers, They &s;hall be the
wor&s;e for the &V;nion, and &s;hall be all &s;ent to the We&s;t-<HI>Indies;</HI>
whereas, fir&s;t, they have an immediate Advantage of <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI>
Pay; and they that &s;uppo&s;e them to be &s;ent to our We&s;t-<HI>Indies,</HI>
mu&s;t allow the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to have a Great Confidence
in the <HI>Scots,</HI> immediately to give them Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their
Rich Colonies.</P>
<P>And yet, if I were to talk to the hone&s;t Soldiery of <HI>Scotland,</HI> I
could tell them, The &V;nion will help them to &s;uch a thing in
<HI>Britain,</HI> as they are unacquainted with in <HI>Scotland,</HI> I mean
Liberty; and this Liberty is &s;uch, as even a Soldier can|not
be li&s;ted but by his own Con&s;ent, and even when he is
li&s;ted, &s;hall not be forced out of his Native Country, without
the &s;ame free Con&s;ent,&mdash;from whence I could enlarge upon
the Ble&s;&s;ing of Liberty, and what Advantages <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hould
reap by it, but I wave that here.</P>
<P>The&s;e things I take to be meer Sugge&s;tions rai&s;ed for other
and &s;ecret Ends: I &s;hall leave them therefore, and proceed
to others of more Moment.</P>
<P>2. That in the Salt Tax, the Draw-back allowed, is not E|quivalent
to the Duty paid, and therefore the Remainder
<PB N="31" REF="30">
will be a Tax upon, and con&s;equently a Di&s;couragement to
the Fi&s;hing Trade, by hindering the Exportation.</P>
<Q>To this I An&s;wer, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The Intent and Meaning of the
Act of Parliament in <HI>England,</HI> before this &V;nion was
brought upon the Stage, was, and &s;till is, That the full
Duty of Forreign Salt, &s;hould be drawn back&mdash;<HI>That
I am po&s;itive in. Secondly,</HI> The Method taken
for the doing it, &s;o well An&s;wers the Meaning, that
there have been Complaints in <HI>England,</HI> that the Mer|chants
got Money by the Draw-back, and thereby im|po&s;ed
upon the Government: And I am very &s;ure,
that in the We&s;t of <HI>England,</HI> where our chief Her|ring
Fishing lies, the Merchants own them&s;elves to be
no Lo&s;ers by it.</Q>
<P>But to come to the Method, the Forreign Salt pays to
the Crown 6. 8 <HI>d. per</HI> Bu&s;hel, 84 <HI>l.</HI> weight to the Bu&s;hel, now
it being impo&s;&s;ible to come to a Certainty, how much Salt
was again exported in every re&s;pective quantity and kind of
Fi&s;h, &s;o as to make the Draw-back exact upon the Mea&s;ure:
It was agreed, to allow the Merchant &s;uch a Draw-back
upon the quantity of Fi&s;h of &s;everal &s;orts, as by Computa|tion
amounted to the full Value of the Tax laid on the Salt
u&s;ed in curing the &s;aid Fi&s;h.</P>
<P>Now, if this be an Equivalent in <HI>England,</HI> as 'tis evident,
and the Merchants no where complain, the Objectors would
do well,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. To &s;hew that it is not an Equivalent in <HI>Scotland.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. To &s;tate the particular Quantities of Salt u&s;ed
in the re&s;pective kinds, and placing the Draw-back
again&s;t the Duty, &s;how us the exact Difference
and let the Nation &s;ee the Deficiency.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>But while none of this is &s;een, and only a pre&s;umptive Ob|jection
offered, That it is not a &s;ufficient Draw-back; I think,
<PB N="32" REF="31">
'tis worth no further Notice: However, to &s;peak more par|ticularly
to the Ca&s;e, than I think it requires, I only hint a
Que&s;tion for the Gentlemen to An&s;wer, if they think Con|venient.</P>
<P>The Draw-back, as I remember, is 8 6 <HI>d.</HI> on every Barrel
of White Herring and 6. 8 <HI>d.</HI> on every Barrel of Red
Herring, containing 1000 Fi&s;h.&mdash;Now, as here is no
occa&s;ion to make Calculations on Proportion of Mea&s;ures;
let any Man but make publick, whether the 1000 Herring in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;hall take up more Salt than 1000 Herring in <HI>Eng|land;</HI>
and if &s;o, I'll grant it may be as they object, and on
proof, they may at any time claim a larger Allowance, tho'
the &V;nion be pa&s;t: For as by the Union, they are to have
<HI>EQ&V;AL ENCOURAGEMENTS;</HI> and the meaning of the
Act is, That the whole Duty &s;hall be drawn back, they can
never be denyed &s;o fair a Claim, when it is made out: But
I dare &s;ay, no Man will ever enter upon that Calculation, or
can hope to make out &s;uch a thing.</P>
<P>But then they &s;ay, The great Stocks to be employ'd in the
Salt, <HI>will ruin the Trade;</HI> and yet they know, that on Impor|tation
of Salt, they that want Stocks may give Bond for the
Duty, they that pay it down have 5 <HI>per Cent</HI> for prompt Pay|ment,
which is a Con&s;ideration for the Disbur&s;e, or will pay
Intere&s;t to borrow it.</P>
<P>With the &s;ame Succe&s;s they object the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cure their
Fi&s;h with their own Salt.</P>
<P>By this they mu&s;t mean the Rock-Salt, or el&s;e it is not true
in Fact; and if they mean the Rock, then 'tis again&s;t them,
for <HI>Scotland</HI> will have the &s;ame Salt cheaper than any Town
in <HI>England,</HI> where they Cure Fi&s;h, can have it.</P>
<P>The Rock-Salt is &s;hipped at <HI>Leverpool</HI> and <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> the fir&s;t
and neare&s;t Town to it in <HI>England,</HI> where they Cure any
Fi&s;h, is <HI>Biddiford;</HI> here they mu&s;t fetch their Coals from
<PB N="33" REF="32">
<HI>Wales</HI> by Sea, and pay 5 <HI>&s;h. per</HI> Chalder, Duty on them to
boil this Salt with; at <HI>Fowy</HI> 'tis &s;till wor&s;e; at <HI>Falmouth, Pen|&s;ance,</HI>
and all the Towns about the Lands-End of <HI>England</HI>
&s;till wor&s;e; whereas <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hall bring the Rock-Salt in 3
days Sail from <HI>Leverpool</HI> to the <HI>Clyd,</HI> then boil it with their
own Coal, which pays no Tax: And thus if the Rock-Salt
will Cure the Fi&s;h, <HI>Scotland</HI> may have it 20 <HI>per Cent</HI> cheaper
than <HI>England;</HI> and all the Quarrel at Foreign Salt dyes to
their own Advantage.</P>
<P>The next Article is the Exci&s;e, wherein Men alarm them|&s;elves
with Notions, That the &s;mall Ale &s;old here at 1 <HI>d.</HI> the
Choppin by Retail, &s;hall be Taxt after the Union, equally
with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Beer or Ale, &s;old for 3 <HI>d:</HI> and 4 <HI>d.</HI> the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
Quart.</P>
<P>By my Calculation, the State of this Di&s;pute lyes thus, and
I doubt not will admit of a fair Explanation before the Union
be concluded.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Beer and Ale is &s;old to the Retailer in <HI>England</HI>
from 20 to 25 <HI>&s;h. per</HI> Barrel of 36 Gallons, tho' Gauged in the
Tax at 34, which is &s;o much Lo&s;s to the Brewer.</P>
<P>The &s;mall Beer is &s;old at 10 to 12 <HI>&s;h.</HI> the &s;ame Barrel, and
<HI>England</HI> knows no &s;orts between the&s;e two; nor is there any
Rate of Exci&s;e between them; one paying 4 <HI>&s;h. 9 d.</HI> the other
1 <HI>&s;h. 3 d. per</HI> Barrel, rebating for leakage 2 &frac12; Barrels in 23.</P>
<P>To bring this to a Proportion, I make it out, that the 2 <HI>d.</HI>
Ale in <HI>Scotland</HI> is Sold for very little, if any thing more, than
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;mall Beer, and can be rated at but very little
more than the Exci&s;e of &s;mall Beer.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Barrel of 36 Gallons in &s;mall Beer is Sold for
10 or 12 <HI>&s;h. Engli&s;h</HI> Money&mdash;The <HI>Scots 2 d.</HI> Ale is Sold to
the Retailer in <HI>Scotland</HI> at a Mark <HI>Scots per</HI> Gallon, which is
13 <HI>d. &frac13; Engli&s;h;</HI> &s;o that the <HI>Scots</HI> Ale is Sold for 13. 4 &frac13; <HI>Sterl.
<PB N="34" REF="33">
per</HI> Barrel <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mea&s;ure at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and in &s;ome Places
cheaper.</P>
<P>Now all the Que&s;tion turns upon this Nicety, Whether 3. 5.
6 <HI>d.</HI> Duty &s;hall be demanded of the <HI>Scots</HI> for the difference of
1 <HI>&s;h. 4 &frac13; per</HI> Barrel in the Price or Value of the Drink?</P>
<P>It is plain, in <HI>England</HI> the &s;trong Beer payes no more than
4 <HI>&s;h. 9 d.</HI> tho' it be made of double &s;trength, and &s;hould &s;ell
for double Price.</P>
<P>By the &s;ame Proportion all Beer or Ale, tho' &s;omething a|bove
the Rate of &s;mall Beer, ought not to pay as &s;trong Beer,
unle&s;s it bears &s;ome Proportion to the Price, and Goodne&s;s of
Strong.&mdash;This is &s;o evident, that one Clau&s;e in an Act of
Parliament here to explain it and &s;tate the Proportion, will
make it effectually ea&s;y; nor will <HI>England</HI> &s;cruple a thing of
&s;o much Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Either you will have the Beer pay as &s;mall Beer in <HI>England</HI>
pays, which is neare&s;t the due Proportion; or you will have
a Middle rate &s;tated, proportioned to its advance in Value
above the &s;mall Beer.</P>
<P>The Act of Parliament in <HI>England</HI> confines the Word &s;mall
Beer to be 6 <HI>&s;h.</HI> Beer, and yet 'tis &s;old for 12, and the Exci&s;e
not rai&s;ed; and it cannot be feared that it &s;hould be called
&s;trong Beer in <HI>Scotland</HI> for &s;o &s;mall a difference.</P>
<P>Again, take it another way, it &s;ells for le&s;s than the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
$mall Beer, as follows.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;mall Beer at 12 &s;h. <HI>per</HI> Barrel, take the Exci&s;e
off, fells to the Brewer for 10 <HI>sh. 9 d.</HI>&mdash;The <HI>Scots</HI> Ale
pays 2 <HI>d. per</HI> Gallon <HI>Scots</HI> Mea&s;ure, which is 2 <HI>&s;h. per</HI> Barrel;
and is therefore neat to the Brewer 11. 4 <HI>d.</HI> Out of which they
pay to the City of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> another Duty of 1. 4 <HI>d. per</HI> Bar|rel;
which reduces it to 10 <HI>&s;h. per</HI> Barrel; if in the Country,
the City-Tax is not paid, then the Ale is &s;old cheaper: So
that every way the Brewer in <HI>Scotland</HI> has very little, if any
<PB N="35" REF="34">
thing more for his Ale, than the Brewer in <HI>England</HI> has for
the &s;mall Beer.</P>
<P>It cannot therefore pay as &s;trong Beer; that would be ex|pre&s;ly
again&s;t the Treaty of Equality.&mdash;It mu&s;t either then
be brought to an exact Calculation, or a Clau&s;e may be form'd
to allow the Brewer in <HI>Scotland</HI> to brew his Ale into &s;trong
and &s;mall, as in <HI>England,</HI> and then reduce them into one Head
of middling Ale by a mixture, the &s;aid mixture to be re&s;train'd
by Act of Parliament, and to be done in the pre&s;ence of the
Officer, he being obliged on notice to attend.</P>
<P>This I humbly conceive to be the middle way, and the
only method to do Ju&s;tice on both &s;ides, and make both Par|ties
ea&s;y, which is the true End of the Union.</P>
<P>There is indeed a certain Gentleman, who has printed,
<HI>Con&s;iderations, &amp;c: upon Trade in Ca&s;e of the &V;nion;</HI> and he
makes large Demands: <HI>As</HI> Fir&s;t, &startq;That the Draw-back upon
Fi&s;h &s;hould be con&s;iderably more than the Value of the Salt.&endq;</P>
<P>This is an admirable Equality, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, and is all
one with a good bounty on the Export of Fi&s;h, and de&s;erves
no other Reply.</P>
<P>On Exci&s;es he demands, That you &s;hould have Draw-backs,
as he calls them, <HI>tho' that is Non-&s;ence, no Duty being
fir&s;t paid,</HI> &startq;on Bear, Pea&s;e and Oats, as well as on Barley, Rye
and Wheat.&endq;</P>
<P>As to their Bear, 'tis plain it is the &s;ame kind as Barley;
and they have a Bounty of 2 <HI>&s;h. 6 d. per</HI> Quarter for it upon Ex|portation;
for Pea&s;e and Oats they need no Bounty to export
them: For <HI>England</HI> wants them, and will take off the great|te&s;t
Quantity they can &s;pare; and it would be Non-&s;ence to
give a Bounty to export that Abroad, which we always want
at Home.</P>
<P>Then he demands Liberty &startq;to export the Woollen Manufa|ctures,
Linen, &amp; other Branches of Improvement of <HI>Scotland.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="35">
This is a very weak Demand. Since you enjoy it by the
very Nature of the thing, and by the Terms of the Union,
no Tax can be laid on the Woollen Manufactures in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
of any &s;ort, unle&s;s at the &s;ame time the &s;ame Tax be laid on
the Woollen Manufactures in <HI>England;</HI> otherwi&s;e how have
the Subjects equal Privileges and equal Taxes?</P>
<P>All the&s;e things are trifling, and of no Con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Then he objects again&s;t the Article of Shipping, but for|gets
that it is not denied for <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships to bring from <HI>Holland</HI>
or <HI>Germany</HI> any Goods to you what&s;oever; and there are e|nough
of them, without letting the <HI>Dutch</HI> into our Trade, and
make them Carriers to <HI>Britain,</HI> when our own Ships and
Sailers want Encouragement.</P>
<P>Then he wants <HI>a Port in</HI> Scotland <HI>to import</HI> Iri&s;h <HI>Wool.</HI>
There is no need to condition in the Treaty for it; you may on
Demand have as many as you plea&s;e, and <HI>England</HI> might
have more if they wanted it, the Re&s;traint being de&s;ign'd for
the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> not the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>So all the&s;e mighty Demands are over; I come next to
their Calculations on the Equivalent, and its being repaid in
11 years: Suppo&s;e I &s;hould allow it to be &s;o&mdash;I &s;ee no Ar|gument
to be drawn from it: they are Equivalents to one
another; <HI>England</HI> gives the Money as an Equivalent to the
Cu&s;toms, and <HI>Scotland</HI> pays the Cu&s;toms as an Equivalent to
the Money. The nece&s;&s;ity of one is the Rea&s;on of the other;
and if the Cu&s;toms did not pay it again, I would ask, <HI>Why is
it advanc'd at all?</HI> But &s;till the Calculation is Suppo&s;itious as
to time al&s;o; and it may be 100 Years or more, for any thing
appears in this Calculation; and if it may be a long time,
then the Con&s;ideration for a Ri&s;que of its Certainty is worth
more than Common Intere&s;t, &s;ince if the Cu&s;toms of <HI>Scotland</HI>
do not encrea&s;e, and if as &s;ome &s;ugge&s;t, Trade &s;hould decline
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> they may perhaps be never repaid at all.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="36">
If the Cu&s;toms do increa&s;e, the Trade increa&s;es, and then the
Union helps you to that Increa&s;e; and &s;o the &s;ooner 'tis paid
<HI>the more you get by the &V;nion;</HI> and the longer 'tis a paying, the
greater the hazard to <HI>England</HI> is in advancing their ready Mo|ney;
and this I think is all can be made of their nice Calcu|lations;
of which I &s;hall &s;peak more largely by and by.</P>
<P>But then &s;ays this wi&s;e Gentleman, All Endeavours &s;hould
be u&s;ed to free us of the Exci&s;e upon Beer and Ale. A very
good Project indeed; and yet you would in the <HI>Fir&s;t place,</HI> re|ceive
above 304066 lib. as an Equivalent for that Exci&s;e. And
<HI>Secondly,</HI> You agree to come to an Equality of Taxes; &s;o
I think there's an End of that Demand.</P>
<P>Another Objection this Author rai&s;es, is about <HI>England</HI>'s be|ing
tied up in Trades by Incorporated Companies&mdash;which is
brought to argue again&s;t di&s;&s;olving the <HI>African</HI> Company here.</P>
<P>Now, as the <HI>African</HI> Company here, neither is, nor in my
Opinion ever was in pro&s;pect of Succe&s;s, or worth any Man's
notice as to <HI>Scotland</HI> in Trade, ab&s;tracted from the A&s;&s;i&s;tance
and Corre&s;pondence from <HI>England for the Vent of their Returns;</HI>
and that it &s;ignifies not two Farthings whether di&s;&s;olv'd or no,
farther than to prevent a new Set of Interlopers with <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Stocks under the <HI>Scots</HI> Title. So as to other Companies in
<HI>England,</HI> the Sugge&s;tion is fal&s;ly &s;tated: For <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> there is
no Exclu&s;ive Company in <HI>England</HI> but that of the <HI>Ea&s;t India,</HI>
and that the <HI>Scots</HI> have equal Right to be concerned in, by
purcha&s;ing the Stock as any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men have.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Guinea Trade,</HI> upon paying 10 <HI>per Cent.</HI> to the
Company, any Body may Trade; and their Factories, Co|lonies
and Forts, being their Settlement under cover of which
you mu&s;t carry on that Trade, 'tis worth the payment to
obtain the Privilege.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turky, Hamburgh,</HI> and <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> Companies, require only
certain &s;mall Mulcts to maintain their Con&s;uls, Re&s;idents, and
<PB N="38" REF="37">
Amba&s;&s;adors; and a &s;mall Fine at taking up the Freedoms
and the Advantages in the&s;e Ca&s;es, as to the &s;afety of Effects
and &s;ecurity of the Commerce abroad, are the Intere&s;t of all
the Traders; &s;o that any Man, <HI>Scots</HI> Man or others, on the&s;e
&s;mall Payments, may be admitted to a Freedom in the Com|pany,
and con&s;equently into the Trade equally with <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Men.</P>
<P>I think I have left none of the Objections unan&s;wered <HI>that
bear any weight in them;</HI> the Duties on Dales and Iron are of no
value to merit an Alteration, you may have great Quantities
of Iron from <HI>England.</HI> As to the Duty on Flax, if it
were to pay 3 lib. <HI>per</HI> 100, in&s;tead of 3 &s;h. it would be the
better for <HI>Scotland,</HI> where they have Land enough and Hands
enough, and ought to plant it them&s;elves; e&s;pecially &s;ince 'tis
apparent, that when they do plant it, their Land produces
better and finer than any they bring from Abroad.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Newfoundland</HI> Fi&s;hing, I have this to &s;ay, that he
does not &s;tate the Fact right, which I am willing to call <HI>IG|NORANCE</HI>
rather than any thing el&s;e. <HI>Fir&s;t, England</HI> has
no Colony now on <HI>Newfoundland</HI> at all; the place is hardly ha|bitable,
the &s;mall Colony they had, never con&s;i&s;ted of 200 Fami|lies,
the Export thither are Trifles, and never were of any
Con&s;ideration, the Trade of <HI>Newfoundland</HI> is carried on
by another Method, the Mercat lies between the <HI>Curers</HI>
and the <HI>Sackers,</HI> Terms I find this Gentleman does not under|&s;tand;
the Mercat is the Exchange of <HI>London,</HI> the Bargains
are tran&s;acted there, and all the re&s;t is done <HI>&s;uper altum mare</HI>
without any Concern on Shore; the re&s;t is needle&s;s to enlarge
upon. The <HI>Sackers</HI> go on to <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Italy;</HI> the <HI>Curers</HI> come
home to <HI>England;</HI> and as to the Colony, it is of very little
Con&s;ideration in this Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>But not to enlarge, I offer my &s;elf before any indifferent
Judger to prove, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That the <HI>Newfoundland</HI> Trade does
<PB N="39" REF="38">
not interfier with the <HI>Scots</HI> Fi&s;hery. <HI>Secondly,</HI> That it cannot
be the Intere&s;t of <HI>England</HI> to prefer it to the <HI>Scots.</HI> And <HI>Third|ly.</HI>
If it was wholly Ingro&s;t by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> it would &s;till in|crea&s;e
the <HI>Scots</HI> Trade for the Cod Fi&s;hing&mdash;but tho&s;e things
are too long to enter upon here.</P>
<P>I return to the Calculations of the Equivalent, and the Pre|&s;umption
of its being quickly repaid: And here I humbly re|commend
to the&s;e <HI>Sons of Numbers and Fractions,</HI> to an&s;wer
the&s;e few Queries to the World, and tell us how they came
to be &s;o forgetful as to leave them out.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. How much of the Cu&s;toms (which by the Equality
they &s;ay they are to come into, and which mu&s;t be the
Sum to refound the&s;e Equivalents, and help to &s;horten
the time)&mdash;is to expire at the end of 3 years after
the Union?</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Whether if the Sum that expires makes up 733 l. in eve|ry
Thou&s;and, or near Three-Fourths of the Sum: How
they came to want their Spectacles, and put that in for
11 years which is to continue but for three; and which
by con&s;equence may make that Equivalent 30 years in
repaying?</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. What Equivalent <HI>Scotland</HI> pays to <HI>England</HI> for the imme|diate
Lo&s;s of at lea&s;t 30000 <HI>per annnm,</HI> which <HI>England</HI>
now receives in Cu&s;toms from <HI>Scotland,</HI> and throws up
at one Ca&s;t by the Union?</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. If they plea&s;e to add that 30000 to the Equivalent, How
many Years it will be then in paying to <HI>England?</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. What the Proportion of <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hall be towards the
Support of the Civil Government all that while? And if
all the Revenues be appropriated to Equivalents, as by
the&s;e Calculaters, it &s;eems to be; whether the Trea&s;ure
of <HI>Britain</HI> mu&s;t not de&s;ray that Charge, while the&s;e E|quivalents
are a paying?</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="40" REF="39">
6. Whether <HI>Scotland</HI> pays all this while any Share to
1300000 lib. <HI>per annum</HI> or thereabouts, the ordinary
expen&s;e of the Royal Navy of <HI>Britain,</HI> and its Appendi|ces
for the Defence of our Trade, maintaining our Coa&s;ts,
Colonies, and Sovereignty of the Seas; in the Advan|tages
of which &s;he will have her &s;hare?</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>When the&s;e Gentlemen have added the&s;e things to their
long Rolls of Figures, and brought the Repayment of Equi|valents
to a head, I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee whether that Fund
&s;hall be made good in this Century or the next.</P>
<P>I had not purpo&s;ed to have entred into this Debate, and had
fini&s;hed this Tract before the&s;e Objections appeared, but I
could not pa&s;s them over. And tho' I had made a Calculati|on
of the Ballances of Trade between <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England</HI>
after the Union, I thought it better to lay by that Calculation,
than omit removing &s;uch Objections as the&s;e; which, however
weak in their Nature, have a mi&s;chievous Tendency to the
keeping alive the unrea&s;onable Prejudices of &s;ome People, a|gain&s;t
what I believe they will at la&s;t &s;ee to be their own
Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>I &s;hall abridge the Heads I had form'd my Calculations in
Trade upon, to as &s;hort a Form as the room I have for it will

<P>Upon the&s;e Heads of Trade fairly &s;tated and Calculated by

&s;uppo&s;ing <HI>Scotland</HI> will apply Her &s;elf to improving and en|crea&s;ing

<P>From hence I pre&s;ume to affirm, that <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hall have the
Ballance of Trade on her &s;ide, above 300000 <HI>l. &s;terl: per Annum.</HI></P>
<P>Nor am I afraid to &s;ay this, with re&s;pect to <HI>England,</HI> be|ing

<P>And this, becau&s;e this Gain is not tran&s;mitted from the

<P>And in this very thing is the Doctrine of a Subjection to <HI>Eng|land</HI>
entirely Overthrown. 'Tis not a &s;ubjecting, but a Com|municating
of Privileges and Intere&s;ts; and to confirm my
Opinion, I de&s;ire no better an Authority, than the example
of the <HI>Romans</HI> and <HI>Sabines</HI> Recorded by <HI>Titus Liv$us,</HI> and
<PB N="42" REF="41">
Quoted again by a famous Author on this very Subject of
Nations Uniting.</P>
<P>&mdash;<HI>quando uniantur duo populi non amittentur jura, &s;ed

and they became one Common-wealth. This is true al&s;o of
Kingdoms, when they are join'd together, not meerly by a
Confederation, or in their having the &s;ame King, but by a
Coalition or real Union. <HI>Grotius de jure Bel: &amp; Pac: Lib. Cap.</HI> 9.
I think I &s;hall need to add nothing to this Quotation about
the Nations being &s;ubjected, nor need I enter upon the ab|&s;urd
Sugge&s;tion, that <HI>England</HI> will or can, after the Union,
&s;ubvert and de&s;troy the Liberty and Privileges of <HI>Scotland;</HI>
but I &s;hall crave leave to tell a &s;hort Story, and therewith
conclude this Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>About the Year in the Reign of <HI>James</HI> IV. of <HI>Scot|land,</HI>
and ju&s;t about the time of his Marriage with <HI>Margaret</HI>
of <HI>England,</HI> Daughter to <HI>Henry</HI> VII. a Woman brought forth
a &s;trange Mon&s;ter at or near the City of <HI>Gla&s;gow;</HI> it was from
the Navel downward <HI>a Man-Child,</HI> one and entire in &s;hape.</P>
<P>It &s;tood upon the &s;ame Feet, had the &s;ame Ve&s;&s;els of Ex|pul&s;ion;
and every part of the Foundation was regular.</P>
<P>But from the Belly upwards it was two di&s;tinct Creatures,
divided in Parts, had two Head, two perfect and &s;eparated
Bodies, and receiv'd its Nouri&s;hment two ways, tho' it void|ed
but by the &s;ame; and which was yet more wonderful, it
had a Divi&s;ion of Souls, two Hearts, &s;eparate and &s;ometimes
oppo&s;ite Wills, Pa&s;&s;ions and Affections; and this &s;o appa|rent,
<PB N="43" REF="42">
that &s;ometimes one &s;ide would quarrel with its Neigh|bour,
and almo&s;t fight.</P>
<P>The Hi&s;torical Part of this Mon&s;ter is atte&s;ted to my hand
by <HI>Buchanan,</HI> and in particular in <HI>Drummond</HI>'s Hi&s;tory of the
Five <HI>James</HI>'s, P. 203. The Creature was brought up at the
King's Charge, and lived 28 Years.</P>
<P>From this &s;trange Story I pre&s;ume to argue a little about
this Union, to which it &s;eems to me a very natural Allegory.</P>
<P>Here are two Nations; they are already tyed together in
all the Foundation-Parts; they &s;tand upon the &s;ame Legs, go
with the &s;ame Feet, and are in&s;eparably join'd in tho&s;e Parts
which are the Support and Strength of the Body; but they
are divided in their upper Parts, have two Con&s;titutions,
two Dige&s;tures, two Wills, and <HI>too much</HI> oppo&s;ite Inclina|tions.</P>
<P>Now
&s;uppo&s;e when this Mon&s;ter was plea&s;ed to be angry
with it &s;elf, or one Part, according to Mr. <HI>Hodges</HI> Interfer'd
with the other, a Man had come and whi&s;pering to one of
the Heads, &s;hould tell it, He would direct it how it &s;hould ef|fectually
&s;ubdue the other, and de&s;troy it; and the thing
&s;hould be &s;o fooli&s;h as to hearken to its own Pa&s;&s;ion, and the
malicious Propo&s;al; What would be the Con&s;equence? would
it not be, that being unable to &s;eparate it &s;elf from that Part
which it had ruin'd, the Mortality of the other would de&s;cend
to the Parts that were e&s;&s;ential to both, and communicating
Corruption to them; the Contagion would a&s;cend, the
whole mu&s;t die, and the Wretch become <HI>Felo de &s;e?</HI></P>
<P>The Application of this is too plain to need the lea&s;t Illu|&s;tration
from me; I leave it to the Con&s;ideration of all <HI>Britain,</HI>
but e&s;pecially I recommend it to tho&s;e that think <HI>England</HI>
when united, can &s;trive to cru&s;h <HI>Scotland,</HI> when &s;he is a Part of
her &s;elf, without feeling the mortal Effects of it, to her own
Pro&s;perity.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>The Sum of this Matter is in &s;hort, to the People of both Na|tions,
to excite them to Union in General. I have nothing to do
with the Terms of it, neither do I enter on the Particulars: If
there be any thing in them to be Objected again&s;t, to be explain'd
or amended, Why do not the&s;e Gentlemen Authors, (for to
them I &s;peak) propo&s;e their Amendments? To Cavil in General,
is ar$a$gning the Sen&s;e of both Kingdoms, that an Incorporate
Union is not nece&s;&s;ary at all.</P>
<P><HI>Scotland</HI> will de&s;ire nothing Unrea&s;onable, <HI>England</HI> will deny no|thing
Rea&s;onable, and &s;mall Explanations on the Articles, will
make all the ju&s;t Objections reconcilable.</P>
<P>If I might entreat the Writers again&s;t it, to do one thing, I
&s;hould take it as a Favour. I am per&s;waded, <HI>Scotland</HI> needs no
Repre&s;entation but Truth, nor de&s;ires any: I would beg the Gentle|men,
to make no A&s;&s;ertions, but what may be ju&s;tified; No
Calculations, but what will bear to be examined, to make no
Sugge&s;tions but what are Probable, nor E&s;timates, but what are
Rational. In all which Articles, the Authors I have &s;poken to, are
plea&s;ed to be Extravagant.</P>
<P>Here is now another Paper abroad, Entitled, <HI>A &s;hort View of
Trade and Taxes.</HI> I wi&s;h that Gentleman would Examin, whether
he is not fallen into the &s;ame Fault: Whether it be true that
<HI>England</HI> has erected any Companies that will re&s;trict the Branches
of the Trade of <HI>Scotland:</HI> Whether his Calculations on Trade,
Cu&s;toms, Taxes and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Debts, are not intollerably Erroneous,
and Suppo&s;itions; And whether his Con&s;iderations on the Mer|chants,
Barons, Burge&s;&s;es, and Mechanicks, are not again&s;t all manner
of probability.</P>
<P>The Treaters have form'd an Union, lyable I believe, to as few Exceptions,
and wanting as few Explanations, as any Set of Men in the World could have
done in that time.&mdash;And I cannot but ob&s;erve, That even the&s;e Gentlemen
that enjoy Places and Salaries here, which mu&s;t cea&s;e by the Union, appear as
forward for it as others. Tho&s;e that have always appeared for the Liberty of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> and &s;uffer'd under <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Inva&s;ions are for it; and I think 'tis for their
Honour, and they need nothing to recommend them and their Families to Po|&s;terity,
when the Fruit of this Union &s;hall be more vi&s;ible, than to have it Wrote
on their Grave Stones and Monuments, <HI>That they zealou&s;ly promoted the &V;nion of</HI>
Britain.</P>
