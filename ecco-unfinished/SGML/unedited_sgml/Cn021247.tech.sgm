<HEAD>ARGUMENT
Introductory to the
OPERA of SEMELE.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s Amour with <HI>Europa,</HI> the Daughter
of <HI>Agenor,</HI> King of <HI>Phoenicia,</HI> he again incen&s;es
<HI>Juno</HI> by a new Affair in the &s;ame Family; <HI>viz.</HI>
with <HI>Semele,</HI> Niece to <HI>Europa,</HI> and Daughter to <HI>Cadmus</HI>
King of <HI>Thebes. Semele</HI> is on the Point of Marriage with
<HI>Athamas;</HI> which Marriage is about to be &s;olemniz'd in the
Temple of <HI>Juno,</HI> Godde&s;s of Marriages, when <HI>Jupiter</HI> by
ill Omens interrupts the Ceremony; and afterward tran|&s;ports
<HI>Semele</HI> to a private Abode prepar'd for her. <HI>Juno,</HI>
after many Contrivances, at length a&s;&s;umes the Shape and
Voice of <HI>Ino,</HI> Si&s;ter to <HI>Semele;</HI> by the Help of which Di&s;|gui&s;e
and artful In&s;inuations, &s;he prevails with her to make
a Reque&s;t to <HI>Jupiter,</HI> which being granted mu&s;t end in her
utter Ruin.</P>
<P>This Fable is related in <HI>Ovid. Metam. L.</HI> 3. but there
<HI>Juno</HI> is &s;aid to impo&s;e on <HI>Semele</HI> in the Shape of an old
Woman, her Nur&s;e. 'Tis hoped, the Liberty taken in &s;ub|&s;tituting
<HI>Ino</HI> in&s;tead of the old Woman will be excus'd: It
was done, becau&s;e <HI>Ino</HI> is interwoven in the De&s;ign by her
Love of <HI>Athamas;</HI> to whom &s;he was marry'd, according
to <HI>Ovid;</HI> and, becau&s;e her Character bears a Proportion
with the Dignity of the other Per&s;ons repre&s;ented. This
Rea&s;on, it is pre&s;umed, may be allowed in a Thing intirely
fictitious; and more e&s;pecially being repre&s;ented under the
Title of an <HI>Opera,</HI> where greater Ab&s;urdities are every
Day excus'd.</P>
<P><PB REF="11">
It was not thought requi&s;ite to have any Regard either to
Rhyme or Equality of Mea&s;ure, in the Lines of that Part
of the Dialogue which was de&s;ign'd for the <HI>Recitative Style</HI>
in Mu&s;ic. For as that Style in Mu&s;ic is not confin'd to the
&s;trict Ob&s;ervation of <HI>Time</HI> and <HI>Mea&s;ure,</HI> which is requir'd
in the Compo&s;ition of <HI>Airs</HI> and <HI>Sonata's,</HI> &s;o neither is it
nece&s;&s;ary that the &s;ame Exactne&s;s in Numbers, Rhymes, or
Mea&s;ure, &s;hould be ob&s;erved in Words de&s;ign'd to be &s;et in
that Manner, which mu&s;t ever be ob&s;erved in the Formation
of <HI>Odes</HI> and <HI>Sonnets.</HI> For what they call <HI>Recitative</HI> in
Mu&s;ic, is only a more tuneable Speaking, it is a kind of Pro&s;e
in Mu&s;ic; its Beauty con&s;i&s;ts in coming near Nature, and in
improving the natural Accents of Words by more Pathetic
or Emphatical Tones.</P>

<L>Vi&s;its the Springs, and hovers round the Grove.</L>

<Q><HI>Hector's</HI> Body (after he was &s;lain) remain'd &s;till in the
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Achilles;</HI> for which <HI>Priam</HI> made great La|mentation.
<HI>Jupiter</HI> had Pity on him, and &s;ent <HI>Iris</HI> to
comfort him, and direct him after what Manner he &s;hould
go to <HI>Archilles</HI>'s Tent; and how he &s;hould there ran&s;om
the Body of his Son. <HI>Priam</HI> accordingly orders his Cha|riot
to be got ready, and preparing rich Pre&s;ents for
<HI>Achilles,</HI> &s;ets forward to the <HI>Grecian</HI> Camp, accompa|ni$d
by no Body but his Herald <HI>Idaeus. Mercury,</HI> at
<HI>Jupiter's</HI> Command, meets him by the Way, in the Figure
of a young <HI>Grecian,</HI> and, after bemoaning his Misfor|t$nes,
undertakes to drive his Chariot, unob&s;erv'd, thro'
the Guards, and to the Door of <HI>Achilles</HI>'s Tent; which
having perform'd, he di&s;cover'd him&s;elf a God, and giving

<L><HI>Priam,</HI> un&s;een by the&s;e, his Way pur&s;u'd,</L>

<HEAD>The Eleventh Satire of JUVENAL.</HEAD>

<HEAD>The ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<Q>The De&s;ign of this Satire is to expo&s;e and reprehend all Man|ner
of Intemperance and Debauchery; but more particu|larly
that exorbitant Luxury u&s;ed by the <HI>Romans,</HI> in
their Fea&s;ting. The Poet draws the Occa&s;ion from an
Invitation, which he here makes to his Friend, to dine
with him; very artfully preparing him, with what he
was to expect from his Treat, by beginning the Satire
with a particular Invective again&s;t the Vanity and
Folly of &s;ome Per&s;ons, who having but mean Fortunes in
the World, attempted to live up to the Height of Men of
great E&s;tates and Quality. He &s;hews us, the mi&s;erable
End of &s;uch Spend-thrifts and Gluttons; with the Man|ner
and Cour&s;es, which they took to bring them&s;elves to
it; advi&s;ing Men to live within Bounds, and to propor|tion
their Inclinations to the Extent of their Fortune. He
gives his Friend a Bill of Fare, of the Entertainment he
has provided for him; and from thence he takes Occa&s;ion
to reflect upon the Temperance and Frugality of the
greate&s;t Men, in former Ages: To which he oppo&s;es the
Riot and Intemperance of the pre&s;ent; attributing to the
latter a vi&s;ible Rem&s;&s;ne&s;s, in the Care of Heaven over the
<HI>Roman</HI> State. He in&s;tances &s;ome lewd Practices at
Fea&s;ts, and by the bye, touches the Nobility, with making
Vice and Debauchery con&s;i&s;t with their principal Plea&s;ures.
<PB N="84" REF="82">
He concludes with a repeated Invitation to his Friend;
advi&s;ing him (in one particular &s;omewhat freely) to a

<L>Happy her future Days! which are de&s;ign'd</L>
<L>Alone to paint the Beauties of the Mind.</L>
<L>By ju&s;t Originals to draw with Care,</L>
<L>And copy from the Court a faultle&s;s Fair:</L>
<L>Such Labours with Succe&s;s her Hopes may crown,</L>

<L>Whence we derive whatever we po&s;&s;e&s;s,</L>
<L>By foreign Conque&s;t, or dome&s;tic Peace.</L>
<L>Then <HI>Britain,</HI> then thy dawn of Bli&s;s begun:</L>

<L>Then was it doom'd who&s;e Councils &s;hou'd &s;ucceed;</L>
<L>And by who&s;e Arm the Chri&s;tian World be freed;</L>

<HEAD>A
DISCOURSE
ON THE
PINDARIQUE ODE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Ode is an Attempt towards re&s;toring the
Regularity of the ancient Lyric Poetry, which &s;eems
to be altogether forgotten or unknown by our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Writers.</P>
<P>There is nothing more frequent among us, than a &s;ort of
Poems intitled Pindarique Odes; pretending to be written
in Imitation of the Manner and Stile of <HI>Pindar,</HI> and yet I
do not know that there is to this Day extant in our Lan|guage,
one Ode contriv'd after his Model. What <HI>Idea</HI> can
an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Reader have of <HI>Pindar</HI> (to who&s;e Mouth, when
a Child, the Bees<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Pau&s;an, Boeotic.</NOTE> brought their Honey, in Omen of the
future Sweetne&s;s and Melody of his Songs) when he &s;hall
&s;he &s;uch rumbling and grating Papers of Ver&s;es, pretending
to be Copies of his Works?</P>
<P>The Character of the&s;e late Pindariques, is, a Bundle of
rambling incoherent Thoughts, expre&s;s'd in a like Parcel of
irregular Stanza's, which al&s;o con&s;i&s;t of &s;uch another Com|plication
of di&s;proportion'd, uncertain and perplex'd Ver&s;es
and Rhymes. And I appeal to any Reader, if this is not
the Condition in which the&s;e Titular Odes appear.</P>
<P>On the contrary, there is nothing more regular than the
Od$s of <HI>Pindar,</HI> both as to the exact Ob&s;ervation of the
Mea&s;ures and Numbers of his Stanza's and Ver&s;es, and the
perpetual Coherence of his Thoughts. For tho' his Digre&s;|&s;ions
are frequent, and his Tran&s;itions &s;udden, yet is there
ever &s;ome &s;ecret Connexion, which tho' not always appearing
to the Eye, never fails to communicate it&s;elf to the Under|&s;tanding
of the Reader.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="147">
The Liberty which he took in his Numbers, and which
h$$ been &s;o<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">For certainly they have utterly mi&s;under&s;tood <HI>$word$,</HI> L. $. <HI>Ode</HI> 2. who have apply'd <HI>numeri&s;&abque; fertur $word$ &s;$lutis,</HI> to all the Odes of <HI>Pindar;</HI> which, there, $$pre&s;ly relates only to his Dithyrambicks, and which $re all intirely lo&s;t. Nothing is plainer, than the Sen&s;e of <HI>H$race</HI> in that Place. He &s;ays, <HI>Pindar</HI> de&s;erves the Laurel, let him write of what, or in what manner &s;o|$$$r, <HI>viz.</HI> fir&s;t, whether he writes <HI>Dithyrambicks,</HI> which <HI>$word$ through the Bounds pre&s;crib'd to other Odes;</HI> Or, &s;e|$$$dly, whether he writes of Gods and Heroes, their $word$ Atchievements, <HI>&amp;c,</HI> Or, thirdly, whether he &s;$ngs of the Victors in the <HI>Grecian</HI> Games: Or, la&s;tly, whether he &s;ings in Honour of the Dead, and writes I leg$e$, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> mi&s;under&s;tood and mi&s;apply'd by his pretended
Imitat$rs, was only in varying the Stanza's in different
Odes; but in each particular Ode they are ever corre&s;pon|dent
one to another in their Turns, and according to the Or|der
of the Ode.</P>
<P>All the Odes of <HI>Pindar</HI> which remain to us, are Songs
of Triumph, Victory of Succe&s;s in the <HI>Grecian</HI> Games:
$hey were &s;ung by a Chorus, and adapted to the <HI>Lyre,</HI> and
&s;ometimes to the <HI>Lyre</HI> and<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Pind. Olymp. 10. <HI>and</HI> Horace L. 4. Ode 1. mi&s;tis C$$minibus non &s;ine fi$$ula, <HI>and</HI> L. 3. Ode 19. cur pendet tacita fi&s;tula c$m Lyra?</NOTE> <HI>Pipe;</HI> they con&s;i&s;ted oftene&s;t

See <HI>Era&s;. Schmid. $word$&punc;</HI> in <HI>Olymp. &amp; de C$rmin. Lyri$.</HI></NOTE> Left. The &s;econd Stanza
<PB N="151" REF="148">
was call'd the <HI>Anti&s;troph&eacute;,</HI> from the Contraver&s;ion of the
<HI>Chorus;</HI> the Singers, in performing that, turning from the
left Hand to the Right, contrary always to their Motion in
the <HI>Stroph&eacute;.</HI> The Third Stanza was called the <HI>Epode,</HI>
(it may be as being the After-&s;ong) which they &s;ung in the
Middle, neither turning to one Hand nor the other.</P>
<P>What the Origin was of the&s;e different Motions and
Stations in &s;inging their Odes, is not our pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s to
enquire. Some have thought that by the Contrariety of the
<HI>Stroph&eacute;</HI> and <HI>Anti&s;troph&eacute;</HI> they intended to repre&s;ent the Con|tra-rotation
of the <HI>Primum Mobile,</HI> in re&s;pect of the <HI>Secunda
Mobilia;</HI> and that by their &s;tanding &s;till at the <HI>Epode,</HI> they
meant to &s;ignify the Stability of the Earth.<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Pind. Schol. &amp; Schmid. <HI>ibid.</HI></NOTE> Others
a&s;cribe the In&s;titution to <HI>The&s;eus,</HI> who thereby expre&s;&s;ed the
Windings and Turnings of the Labyrinth, in celebrating his
Return from thence.</P>
<P>The Method ob&s;erv'd in the Compo&s;ition of the&s;e Odes,
was therefore as followes. The Poet having made Choice
of a certain Number of Ver&s;es to con&s;$itute his <HI>Stroph&eacute;</HI> or
fir&s;t <HI>Stanza,</HI> was oblig'd to ob&s;erve the &s;ame in his <HI>Anti|&s;troph&eacute;,</HI>
or &s;econd <HI>Stanza;</HI> and which accordingly perpe|tually
agreed whenever repeated, both in Number of Ver&s;es
and Quantity of Feet: He was then again at Liberty to
make a new Choice for his third <HI>Stanza,</HI> or <HI>Epode;</HI> where,
accordingly, he diver&s;if$'d his Numbers, as his Ear or Fancy
led him; compo&s;ing that <HI>Stanza</HI> of more or fewer Ver&s;es
than the former, and tho&s;e Ver&s;es of different Mea&s;ures and
Quantities, for the greater Variety of Harmony, and En|tertainment
of the Ear.</P>
<P>But then this <HI>Epode</HI> being thus form'd he was &s;trictly
oblig'd to the &s;ame<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Vid. Jul. Scal. Poetic. ad Fin. Cap. $7. l. 3.</NOTE> Mea&s;ure as often as he &s;hould repeat it
in the Order of his Ode, &s;o that every <HI>Epode</HI> in the &s;ame
Ode is eternally the &s;ame in Mea&s;ure and Quantity, in re&s;pect
to it&s;elf; as is al&s;o every <HI>Stroph&eacute;</HI> and <HI>Anti&s;troph&eacute;,</HI> in
re&s;pect to each other.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lyrick</HI> Poet <HI>Ste&s;ichorus</HI> (whom<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Longin. de Sub. c. 13.</NOTE> Longinus
reckons among&s;t the able&s;t Imitators of <HI>Homer,</HI>

and of whom<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Quint. In&s;t. l. 10. c. 1.</NOTE> Quintilian &s;ays, that if he could have
kept within Bounds, he would have been neare&s;t of any
Body, in Merit, to <HI>Homer</HI>) was, if not the Inventer of
this Order in the Ode, yet &s;o &s;trict an Ob&s;erver of it in his
Compo&s;itions, that the Three <HI>Stanza's</HI> of <HI>Ste&s;ichorus</HI> be|c$$e
a common Proverb to expre&s;s a thing univer&s;ally

$word$ one had a mind to reproach another with exce&s;&s;ive Igno|r$$$$,
he could not do it more effectually than by telling him,
<HI>he did not &s;o much as know the Three Stanza's of</HI> Ste|$$
$word$ that is, did not know that an Ode ought to con|$$$$
of a <HI>Stroph&eacute;,</HI> an <HI>Anti&s;troph&eacute;,</HI> and an <HI>Epode.</HI> If
$word$ &s;uch a Mark of Ignorance among them, I am &s;ure
$word$ have been pretty long liable to the &s;ame Reproof; I mean,
$word$ to re&s;pect of our Imitations of the Odes of <HI>Pindar.</HI></P>
<P>My $word$ is not to make a long Preface to a &s;hort Ode,
nor to $nter upon a Di&s;&s;ertation of Lyric Poetry in general:
$span$ much I thought proper to &s;ay, for the Information
of th$&s;e Readers who&s;e Cour&s;e of Study has not led 'em into
&s;uch Enquiries.</P>
<P>I hope I &s;hall not be &s;o mi&s;under&s;tood, as to have it
thought that I pretend to give an exact Copy of <HI>Pindar</HI> in
this en&s;uing Ode; or that I look upon it as a Pattern for
his Imitat$rs for the future: Far from &s;uch Thoughts, I
have only given an In&s;tance of what is practicable, and am
&s;en&s;ible that I am as di&s;tant from the Force and Elevation of
<HI>Pindar,</HI> as others have hitherto been from the Harmony
and Regularity of his Numbers.</P>
<P>Ag$ in, we having no <HI>Chorus</HI> to &s;ing our Odes, the Titles,
as well as U&s;e of <HI>Stroph&eacute;, Anti&s;troph&eacute;,</HI> and <HI>Epode,</HI> are
ob&s;olete and impertinent; And certainly there may be very
good <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Odes, without the Di&s;tinction of <HI>Greek</HI> Ap|pellations
to their <HI>Stanza's.</HI> That I have mention'd 'em
$ere, and ob&s;erv'd the Order of 'em in the en&s;uing Ode, is
therefore only the more intelligibly to explain the extraordi|nary
Regularity of the Compo&s;ition of tho&s;e Odes, which
<PB N="153" REF="150">
have been repre&s;ented to us hitherto, as the mo&s;t confus'd
Structures in Nature.</P>
<P>However, though there be no Nece&s;&s;ity that our Triumphal
Odes &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of the Three aforemention'd <HI>Stanza's;</HI>
yet if the Reader can ob&s;erve that the great Variation of
the Numbers in the Third <HI>Stanza</HI> (call it <HI>Epode,</HI> or what
you plea&s;e) has a plea&s;ing Effect in the Ode, and makes
him return to the Fir&s;t and Second <HI>Stanzas,</HI> with more
Appetite, than he could do if always cloy'd with the &s;am$
Quantities and Mea&s;ures, I cannot &s;ee why &s;ome U&s;e may
not be made of <HI>Pindar</HI>'s Example, to the great Improvement
of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ode. There is certainly a Plea&s;ure in be|holding
any Thing that has Art and Difficulty in the Con|trivance;
e&s;pecially, if it appears &s;o carefully executed
that the Difficulty does not &s;hew it&s;elf, 'till it is &s;ought for;
and that the &s;eeming Ea&s;ine&s;s of the Work, fir&s;t &s;ets us upon
the Enquiry. Nothing can be call'd beautiful without Propor|tion.
When Symmetry and Harmony are wanting, neither
the Eye nor the Ear can be pleas'd. Therefore certainly
<HI>Poetry,</HI> which includes Painting and Mu&s;ic, &s;hould not be
de&s;titute of 'em; and of all <HI>Poetry,</HI> e&s;pecially the <HI>Ode,</HI>
who&s;e End and E&s;&s;ence is Harmony.</P>
<P><HI>Mr.</HI> Cowely, <HI>in his Preface to his Pindarique Odes,
&s;peaking of the Mu&s;ic of Numbers&punc; &s;ays</HI> which &s;ometimes
(e&s;pecially in Songs and Odes) almo&s;t without any thing
el&s;e makes an excellent Poet.</P>
<P>Having mention'd Mr. <HI>Cowley,</HI> it may very well be
expected, that &s;omething &s;hould be &s;aid of him, at a Tim:
when the Imitation of <HI>Pindar</HI> is the Theme of our Di&s;cour&s;e.
But there is that great Deference due to the Memory, great
Parts, and Learning of that Gentleman, that I think no|thing
&s;hould be objected to the Latitude he has taken in his
Pindarique Odes. The Beauty of his Ver&s;es, are an Atone|ment
for the Irregularity of his <HI>Stanza's;</HI> and though he
did not imitate <HI>Pindar</HI> in the Strictne&s;s of his Numbers, he
has very often happily copy'd him in the Force of his Figures,
and Sublimity of his Sile and Sentiments.</P>
<P>Yet I mu&s;t beg leave to add, that I believe tho&s;e irregular
Odes of Mr. <HI>Cowley,</HI> may have been the principal though
innocent Occa&s;ion, of &s;o many deformed Poems &s;ince, which
in&s;tead of being true Pictures of <HI>Pindar,</HI> have (to u&s;e the
<PB N="154" REF="151">
<HI>Italian</HI> Painters Term) being only <HI>Caricaturas</HI> of him, Re|&s;emblances
that for the mo&s;t part have been either horrid or
ridiculous.</P>
<P>For my own part, I frankly own my Error, in having
heretofore mi&s;-call'd a few irregular <HI>Stanza</HI>'s a Pindarique
Ode; and po&s;&s;ibly, if others who have been under the &s;ame
Mi&s;take, would ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;s the Truth, they might
o$$n, that never having con&s;ulted <HI>Pindar</HI> him&s;elf, they took
all his Irregularity upon tru&s;t; and finding their Account
in the great Ea&s;e with which they could produce Odes with|out
being oblig'd either to Mea&s;ure or De&s;ign, remain'd &s;a|$$sfy$d;
and it may be were not altogether unwilling to
neglect being und$ceiv'd.</P>
<P>Though there be little (if any thing) le&s;t of <HI>Orpheus</HI>
but his Name, yet if<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Boectic. <HI>pag.</HI> 588.</NOTE> <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> was well inform'd, we
may be a&s;&s;ur'd that <HI>Brevity</HI> was a Beauty which he mo&s;t
indu&s;$riou&s;ly labour'd to pre&s;erve in his <HI>Hymns,</HI> notwith|&s;tanding,
as the &s;ame Author reports, that they were but
&s;aw in Number.</P>
<P>The Shortne&s;s of the following Ode will, I hope, atone
for the Length of the Preface, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure for the
Defects which may be found in it. It con&s;i&s;ts of the &s;ame
Number of <HI>Stanzas</HI> with that beautiful Ode of <HI>Pindar</HI>
which is the fir&s;t of his <HI>Pythicks;</HI> and though I was
unable to imitate him in any other Beauty, I re&s;olv'd to en|deavour
to copy his Brevity, and take the Advantage of a
Remarke he has made in the la&s;t <HI>Stroph&eacute;</HI> of the &s;ame Ode,
which takes in the Paraphra&s;e of <HI>Sudorius.</HI></P>

<HEAD>To the Reader of the en&s;uing HYMN.</HEAD>
<P>OF the three greater Hymns of <HI>Homer, viz.</HI> one to
<HI>Apollo,</HI> one to <HI>Mercury,</HI> and one to <HI>Venus,</HI> this to
<HI>Venus,</HI> is the &s;horte&s;t; it is al&s;o the mo&s;t &s;imple in its De&s;ign,

Digre&s;&s;ions both Geographical and Mythological, and contain
many Allu&s;ions to ancient cu&s;toms and Hi&s;tory, which with|out
a Commentary could not well be under&s;tood by the gene|rality
of Readers. The&s;e Con&s;iderations determin'd me to
acquie&s;ce in the Tran&s;lation of this Hymn; tho' I had once
entertain'd Thoughts of turning 'em all three into <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Ver&s;e.</P>
<P>As I had often read them all with extraordinary Plea&s;ure;
I could not avoid &s;ometimes reflecting on the Cen&s;ures of &s;ome
Grammarians, who have deny'd or at lea&s;t doubted them to
be genuine.</P>
<P>A Poem which is good in it&s;elf, cannot really lo&s;e any
thing of its Value, tho' it &s;hould appear, upo$ a &s;trict En|quiry,
not to be the Work of &s;o eminent an Author, as him,
to whom it was fir&s;t imputed. But all Truth is &s;o amiable
in it&s;elf that even where it is of lea&s;t Importance there is a
Plea&s;ure in the Search after it, and a Satisfaction in the
Vindication of it.</P>
<P>Tho' the Beauties of this en&s;uing Poem, in the Original
want not even the Name of <HI>Homer</HI> to recom$$nd 'em, and
<PB N="174" REF="171">
much le&s;s does that mighty Name &s;tand in need of their Re|putation,
yet, if they are his, 'tis an Inju&s;tice to him to a|&s;crib$

'$m of the Authority due to them, and to leave 'em to
make their Way thro' bad Iudgments, purely by their own
Merit.</P>
<P>I will not trouble the Reader with the Enquiry my Curio|&s;ity
led me to make in this Matter; I will only give him one
Rea&s;on, of many, why the&s;e Hymns may be receiv'd for ge|nuine.
The mo&s;t &s;u&s;pected of 'em all, is that to <HI>Apollo.</HI> (As

it legitimate, to ob&s;erve that <HI>Lucretius</HI> thought it not

of his own admirable Poem.)</P>

The Youth readily demanded of her the la&s;t Favour, which &s;he as readily promis'd; and according to Agree|ment, &s;ent a Bee to &s;ummon him at the Time when he might be happy: But the young Man happening to be gaming at Dice when the Bee came, was &s;o offended with its b$zzing that he gave it ill Words, and chid it from him: this Reception of her Amba&s;&s;dor &s;o enraged the Nymph, that in Revenge &s;he render'd him impo|tent.
