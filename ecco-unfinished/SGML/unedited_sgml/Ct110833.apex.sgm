<P>THE original plan of this work propo&s;ed no more than. that each volume &s;hould contain a narrative of tho&s;e events which di&s;tingui&s;h its own Year. But, becau&s;e we have entered upon our undertaking in the heat of an almo&s;t general and very important war, I thought it would not be unnece&s;&s;ary or di&s;agreeable to look a little farther back. It would be difficult, perfectly to under&s;tand the operations of the &s;everal powers at war, during the la&s;t year, without reviewing the tran&s;actions of the pre|ceding years; nor would it be ea&s;y to enter into the &s;pirit of the&s;e with|out examining the cau&s;es which
<PB N="2" REF="12">
more nearly or remotely operated to produce tho&s;e troubles that have in|volved &s;o many parts of the world in one common di&s;traction.</P>
<P>The war in which all parties and intere&s;ts &s;eem now to be &s;o perfectly blended, aro&s;e from cau&s;es which originally had not the lea&s;t connec|tion: the uncertain limits of the Engli&s;h and French territories in America; and the mutual claims of the hou&s;es of Au&s;tria and Brande|bourg on the dutchy of Sile&s;ia. It is no wonder that the two former powers &s;eizing on a country in which they con&s;idered the right of the na|tural inhabitants as nothing, &s;hould find it a very difficult matter to &s;ettle their own. For a long time neither of the&s;e powers were &s;ufficiently ac|quainted with the geography of A|merica, to enable them to a&s;certain the limits of their &s;everal preten&s;ions with any tolerable exactne&s;s; nor, indeed, were the&s;e matters deemed of &s;ufficient moment to call for a very laborious di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. At the treaty of Utrecht, whil&s;t &s;o many more important intere&s;ts, or what then &s;eemed more important, were di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, the limits of Nova Scotia, then called Acadia, were expre&s;&s;ed only in general terms, and left to be put on a more certain footing by &s;ub&s;equent negotiations. The&s;e ne|gotiations pur&s;ued with no vigour, and drawn out into an exce&s;&s;ive length, &s;eemed only to increa&s;e the former confu&s;ion. After the acce&s;|&s;ion of the pre&s;ent Royal Family, a French: connection, perhaps nece&s;|&s;ary from the circum&s;tances of the time, and afterwards a certain ne|gligence of all affairs but tho&s;e of our dome&s;tic polity, &s;uffered this important point to vani&s;h almo&s;t wholly out of our con&s;ideration. During this interval, our colonies on the continent of North America, extended them&s;elves on every &s;ide. Whil&s;t agriculture and the maritime commerce flouri&s;hed on their coa&s;ts, the Indian trade drew &s;everal of our wandering dealers far into the inland country, and beyond the great mountains. Here they found them|&s;elves in a delightful climate, in a &s;oil abundantly fruitful, and watered with many fair and navigable rivers. The&s;e advantages, joined to tho&s;e of the Indian trade, appeared to com|pen&s;ate for its remotene&s;s from the &s;ea. It was judged, that as the fir&s;t &s;ettlers on the coa&s;t, we had a good right to the inland country; and, if &s;o, to the navigation of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, which opened another door to the ocean. With the&s;e views, a com|pany of merchants and planters, ob|tained a charter for a con&s;iderable tract of land near the River Ohio, on the we&s;tern &s;ide of the Allegeney mountains, but within the province of Virginia; and the adventurers began to &s;ettle pur&s;uant to the terms of their patent.</P>
<P>Now began to &s;hoot forth the &s;eeds of another di&s;pute, which had long lain unob&s;erved, but which proved altogether as thorney and in|tricate as that concerning the limits of Acadia. The French pretending to have fir&s;t di&s;covered the mouths of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, claimed the whole ad|jacent country, towards New Mexico on the ea&s;t, quite to the Apalachian or Allegeney mountains on the we&s;t. They drove off the new &s;ettlers, and built a &s;trong fort called du Que&s;ne, on the forks of the River Mononga|hela; a &s;ituation which commanded the entrance into all the country on the Ohio and Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi.</P>
<P>The reader will ob&s;erve, that I do not pretend to decide con|cerning the right of either nation in this conte&s;t. It is evident e|nough, that the con&s;ideration of
<PB N="3" REF="13">
the right had much le&s;s influence on both parties, than the con&s;ideration of conveniency. Should the French be able to unite Canada to their co|lonies at the mouth of Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi by a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all that va&s;t country which lies between them, the En|gli&s;h colonies mu&s;t lo&s;e all &s;hare in the Indian trade in time of peace; and in time of war be expo&s;ed to continual dangers, or to the ruin|ou&s;ly chargeable defence of a fron|tier more than 1500 miles in length. If on the contrary, the French &s;hould fail to make good the&s;e claims on the Ohio, and tho&s;e on Nova Scotia, their two colonies entirely di&s;united, and the entrance into one &s;hut up for the winter &s;ea&s;on by fro&s;t, and the entrance into the other difficult in all &s;ea&s;ons by the banks at the mouth of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, mu&s;t certainly lo&s;e all their value to France, and in their fall involve much of the for|tune of their great &s;ettlements in the We&s;t Indies.</P>
<P>Both nations being fully per&s;uaded of this, no longer looked on the affair of the Ohio as a matter of indiffe|rence. They prepared to cut the gordian knot of the long and intri|cate negotiation by the &s;word. Ships were fitted out, and &s;ome troops &s;ilently &s;ent off from Bre&s;t. General Braddock &s;ailed to Virginia with a|bout 1500 regular troops; 24 men of war under the <NOTE PLACE="marg">1755.</NOTE> Admirals Bo&s;cawen and Mo&s;tyn were ordered to America, to inter|cept the French &s;upplies. Orders were &s;ent to our colonies to arm; and three operations were actually undertaken, one again&s;t Fort du Que&s;ne under Braddock; the other two again&s;t the French forts in No|va Scotia, and the fort of Crown Point on the frontiers of New York. The two courts in the mean time breathed nothing but peace, and ex|changed reciprocal profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip and good will, which de|ceived neither party.</P>
<P>They who are of opinion that the pa&s;&s;ions and characters of the ruling men, influence all public concerns as much as the public intere&s;ts them&s;elves, thought they &s;aw other cau&s;es operating to ha&s;ten this breach. On the death of a great Mini&s;ter, which happened &s;ome time before, the admini&s;tration was new mould|ed. Some per&s;ons then taken in, were con&s;idered as belonging to a party not perfectly united with the remains of the old admini&s;tration. It was thought, that the leading man of this party propo&s;ed to work out the old &s;ervants of the crown, in order to make way for a more uni|form &s;y&s;tem. As long as peace &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, government is &s;upported by it&s;elf; and any change is difficult. But the conduct of a war, is a thing critical to a mini&s;try. The leader of this party, therefore, con&s;cious of his own talents, which all men ac|knowledged to be con&s;picuous, and of his connexions which were con&s;i|derable, warmly pu&s;hed on a war, &s;econded by the fairne&s;s of the pub|lic motives, and the general voice of the people. In this war his friends relied that things mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;o embarra&s;&s;ed, that the old party would find them&s;elves obliged to re|tire, and to leave the &s;tage clear for them to &s;erve their country accord|ing to their own plans, and on their own terms. This de&s;ign was be|lieved to be pu&s;hed forward by ano|ther great man of that party, who had played a game nearly of the &s;ame kind before, and in whom an advanced age had not abated any thing of his natural fire and love of violent councils.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="14">
Things came to a cri&s;is by the taking of two French men of war by the Admirals Bo&s;|cawen <NOTE PLACE="marg">June 10.</NOTE> and Mo&s;tyn. The operations by land were carried on with vigour; but whether conducted with equal judgment, we &s;tand too near the time to decide. However, the French fort at <NOTE PLACE="marg">June 16.</NOTE> Beau&s;ejour was taken, and &s;oon after tho&s;e on St. John's river were abandoned; by which we re|mained ma&s;ters of all Nova Scotia. The principal expedition was that again&s;t Fort du Que&s;ne, under Ge|neral Braddock. That General a|bounding too much in his own &s;en&s;e for the degree of military knowledge he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, commanding in a country which he did not know, and carrying on a &s;pecies of war in which he had no experience, &s;uffered him|&s;elf, when he had advanced within 10 miles of Fort du Que&s;ne, to be &s;urpri&s;ed by an ambu&s;cade of French and Indians. His army was &s;eized with a panic from <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 9.</NOTE> the unu&s;ual appearance, and horrid cries of the &s;avages; they fled in confu&s;ion; they were totally de|feated with a con&s;iderable &s;laughter, e&s;pecially of their officers. The Ge|neral him&s;elf, after having five hor&s;es killed under him, was mortally wounded; wiping away all the er|rors of his conduct by an honourable death for his country.</P>
<P>The nation was &s;omething con|&s;oled for this lo&s;s in the &s;ignal advan|tage gain'd by General John&s;on, who commanded the expediti|on de&s;igned again&s;t Crown <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sep. 7.</NOTE> Point. He was attacked in his in|trenchments by the French General Die&s;kau; but the a&s;&s;ailants wanting cannon, and firing from too great a di&s;tance, were totally defeated, and Die&s;kau him&s;elf was made pri&s;oner. This victory, tho' very honourable for Mr. John&s;on and the provincial troops under his command, yet, as it was gained late in the &s;ea&s;on, and as the army was in no very good condition, it had no con&s;equences. On the whole, we &s;eemed, after al|lowing for this victory, and for the di&s;lodgement of the French from Nova Scotia, to have had the wor&s;t part in the campaign; con&s;idering the &s;anguine expectations which had been formed, and the great &s;uperio|rity of &s;trength which we exerted, or were able to have exerted, in that part of the world.</P>
<P>During this &s;ummer, our court took a re&s;olution not to wait the precarious operation of our arms in America for redre&s;s of the grievances complained of, but to &s;trike &s;uch a blow as would at once put a &s;ecuri|ty into our hands, for the evacuat|ing the places the enemy had forti|fied in our territories, and di&s;able them in the two mo&s;t material points, the re&s;ources of their trade, and their &s;eamen. Their merchant &s;hips were every where attacked, as if war had been actually declared, and va&s;t numbers brought into our ports. The French made all Eu|rope re&s;ound with complaints of what they called a proceeding &s;o un|ju&s;t, and a violation of the law of nations &s;o flagrant and unprecedent|ed. But, whether it was that they were really in no condition to act, or that they intended to influence the other courts in their favour, by a &s;hew of extraordinary moderation, they contented them&s;elves with this, and neither declared war, nor made any &s;ort of repri&s;al for &s;eve|ral months after. At length <NOTE PLACE="marg">1756.</NOTE> they began to act; &s;everal bodies of troops moved to the coa&s;ts of Picar|dy, Normandy and Britany; and all things threatened an inva&s;ion on &s;ome part of this kingdom.

&s;hadow of this &s;tratagem, they got ready in the harbour of Toulon a fleet of twelve men of war of the line, with the utmo&s;t expe|dition, which convoyed an <NOTE PLACE="marg">April 18.</NOTE> army of about 11,000 men, under command of the Duke de Richlieu, to the i&s;land of Minorca.</P>
<P>In a few days they opened trenches before St. Phillp's fort. <NOTE PLACE="marg">April 25.</NOTE></P>
<P>This was done whil&s;t the nation trembled under a &s;hameful panic, too public to be concealed, too fa|tal in its con&s;equences to be ever forgotten. The real inva&s;ion did not le&s;&s;en our fears of the imaginary one; it threw us into a confu&s;ion that &s;uffered us to be &s;en&s;ible of no|thing but our own weakne&s;s. We did not look upon our&s;elves &s;uffici|ently &s;ecured by the arrival of the Hanoverian and He&s;&s;ian troops, which the &s;ame weakne&s;s had in|duced us to call to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The mini&s;try &s;eemed to have been infected with the common terror; for though they had very early no|tice of the French de&s;igns, &s;uch was the apprehen&s;ion of the inva&s;ion, or &s;uch the ill-contrived di&s;po&s;ition of our navy, that Admiral Byng was not di&s;patched to the Mediterranean before the 5th of April, and then with a &s;quadron of no more than 10 &s;hips of the line.</P>
<P>The engagement with the French fleet under M. Gali&s;&s;oniere; the retreat of Byng by which <NOTE PLACE="marg">May 12.</NOTE> the garri&s;on of fort St. was cut off from all hopes of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Philip</NOTE> relief; the &s;urrender of that garri&s;on after nine weeks <NOTE PLACE="marg">June 29.</NOTE> open trenches; the &s;enti|ments of the court and the pub|lic, on the different merits of the governor and the admiral; the op|po&s;ition of &s;ome, who thought the one too highly honoured, and the other too &s;everely cen&s;ured, and the mea&s;ures which rather indignation at our lo&s;&s;es and di&s;graces, than a cool &s;en&s;e of things obliged us to take, are known to all the world. Our affairs were in &s;uch a condition that we were driven to the expedient of a court martial to revive the Briti&s;h &s;pirit, and to the unfortunate nece&s;|&s;ity of &s;hedding the blood of an Admiral, a per&s;on of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 14. 1757.</NOTE> a noble family, as a &s;acrifice to the di&s;cipline of our navy.</P>
<P>From this melancholy picture, let us turn our eyes another way, and review the &s;teps by which this war came to involve the re&s;t of the con|tending powers. The French, a|mong&s;t the other plans they formed for di&s;tre&s;&s;ing our affairs, made no &s;ecret of their de&s;ign of attacking his Maje&s;ty's German dominions. The&s;e countries evidently had no &s;ort of connexion with the matters which gave ri&s;e to the war. But being un|der a Sovereign &s;o remarkably affec|tionate to his native country; they judged he might be terrified into a relaxation of his rights in America, to pre&s;erve Hanover from the cala|mities with which it was threatened. Their politics, however, in this in|&s;tance proved as un&s;ucce&s;sful as they were unju&s;t. No motion was made towards an abatement in our claims with regard to America; his Ma|je&s;ty took other methods for the pre&s;ervation of the peace of Ger|many. His Briti&s;h &s;ubjects by their repre&s;entatives, not more generou&s;ly than rea&s;onably, re&s;olved to defend the Hanoverians if attacked in their quarrel. To an&s;wer this purpo&s;e; the mini&s;try entered into a &s;ub&s;idy treaty with the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, in virtue of which &s;he was to hold 55,000 men in readine&s;s to be &s;ent on a requi&s;ition wherever the Briti&s;h &s;ervice required.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="17">
The alliance with Ru&s;&s;ia was cho|&s;en for rea&s;ons which were then &s;ufficiently plau&s;ible; though it is to be hoped they can never &s;ub&s;i&s;t a|gain. The long ill under&s;tanding be|tween the King of Pru&s;&s;ia and our court, and his clo&s;e connexion with that of Ver&s;ailles, rai&s;ed no ill|grounded apprehen&s;ions that he might be induced to act a dangerous part on this occa&s;ion. Ru&s;&s;ia was therefore a proper ally, who had both a political and per&s;onal enmity to this monarch, and who would be &s;ure to employ a great power with great vi|gour in &s;uch a cau&s;e. But this &s;y|&s;tem was in a &s;hort time totally re|ver&s;ed. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia had been too well appri&s;ed of the clo&s;e conjunction of the courts of Peter&s;|burg and Vienna, and of the real motive to that conjunction, to have the lea&s;t de&s;ign of embroiling him&s;elf with England. Matters were there|fore very &s;oon explained, and the treaty between his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty and this court, to keep all foreigners out of the Empire, was &s;igned at London in January 1756. The&s;e treaties were cen&s;ured as incon&s;i&s;tent with each other; but in reality they were con&s;i&s;tent enough, aiming pre|ci&s;ely at the &s;ame object, to oppo&s;e the &s;chemes meditated by France for di&s;turbing the affairs of Germany.</P>
<P>If reflecting on the &s;entiments of the&s;e courts, there was &s;omething unexpected in the alliance between Great Britain and Pru&s;&s;ia; it was &s;oon followed by another alliance of a nature infinitely more &s;urpri&s;ing. The Empre&s;s Queen of Hungary, finding England in no di&s;po&s;ition to co-operate in her de&s;igns, had re|cour&s;e to other mea&s;ures. The hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, which had formerly united Europe to pre&s;erve her from the power of France, now entered her&s;elf into the mo&s;t intimate union with that power. By this extraor|dinary revolution, the whole political &s;y&s;tem of Europe a&s;&s;umed a new face; it was indeed a revolution &s;o extraordinary, that we &s;hall be ju&s;ti|fied if we interrupt the cour&s;e of this narrative, to look back at the cau&s;es which produced it.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e of Brandenbourg, a little more than two centuries ago, was in a very humble condition. But by the part &s;he took in the refor|mation, which put into her hands the e&s;tates of the Teutonic order; by a marriage from which &s;he acquir|ed the dutchy of Cleves; and by an uncommon &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of able Princes who carefully improved eve|ry turn in the affairs of Germany to their advantage, &s;he rai&s;ed her&s;elf by degrees to a con&s;iderable &s;tate, to an electorate, and at la&s;t to a royalty, not only in name but in power. The late King of Pru&s;&s;ia, in order to &s;trengthen this power, though he pa&s;t almo&s;t his whole reign in the mo&s;t profound peace, gave his whole attention to his army; frugal in all other re&s;pects, in this alone he was expen&s;ive; it was his bu|&s;ine&s;s, and what was perhaps of greater moment, it was his only di|ver&s;ion. Thus in a reign apparently inactive, there was always kept up an army of near 100,000 men, in as much exerci&s;e as they could have in peace, and formed with the mo&s;t per|fect di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>When his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty came to the throne, he immediately &s;hew|ed a di&s;po&s;ition of employing ef|fectually that military force which his father had &s;pent his life only in forming and training. He managed his di&s;pute with the Bi&s;hop of Liege by the &s;ummary method of force; and &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to carry all things with &s;o high an hand, as made him indeed much re&s;pected, but
<PB N="7" REF="18">
much dreaded too by the Princes of the Empire, who &s;aw that there was another power to be feared in Ger|many, be&s;ides that of Au&s;tria. But the&s;e were &s;mall matters, rather &s;igns of the di&s;po&s;ition of this Prince, than exertions of it. He meditated much greater things; and only wait|ed an opportunity to make good the antient claims of his family on the mo&s;t con&s;iderable part of the dutchy of Sile&s;ia. The right to that dutchy had been a very intricate affair; but the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria availing her&s;elf of the greatne&s;s of her power, and of a di&s;&s;en&s;ion between the Elector Frederick II. and his &s;on, prevail|ed with the Elector to give up that right for an equivalent; then &s;he per&s;uaded his &s;on to confirm the treaty; and at the &s;ame time for a trivial con&s;ideration to give up the equivalent it&s;elf. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia, not thinking him&s;elf bound by the&s;e acts, though con|firmed by a long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, took advantage of his own power and the embarra&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, to re&s;ume what their power and the embarra&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances of his family had formerly deprived him of. For im|mediately on the death of Charles the 6th, when the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 1740.</NOTE> Au&s;trian greatne&s;s &s;eemed irrecoverably lo&s;t, he entered into Sile&s;ia, and made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the whole country with little oppo&s;ition. Then uniting with the French and Bavarians, he &s;ecured his conque&s;ts by two deci&s;ive vic|tories, and by a treaty which yielded him the <NOTE PLACE="marg">June 11, 1742.</NOTE> greate&s;t and be&s;t part of Sile&s;ia and the whole county of Glatz. But the cau&s;e of the Emperor which the <NOTE PLACE="marg">June 2, 1744.</NOTE> King of Pru&s;&s;ia had em|braced, &s;oon cau&s;ed a renewal of ho&s;tilities; the Queen of Hungary &s;aw her&s;elf defeated in three pitched battles; her new ally the King of Poland, driven from his German do|minions, and the King of Pru&s;&s;ia en|tering Dre&s;den in triumph, where he gave the law in a treaty, by which Sile&s;ia was once more <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 1745.</NOTE> &s;olemnly confirmed to him: in return to which he guarantied to the Queen of Hungary the re&s;t of her dominions.</P>
<P>The Queen of Hungary could not ea&s;ily lo&s;e the memory of the wound &s;he had received in the lo&s;s of one of the fine&s;t and riche&s;t parts of all her dominions. Sile&s;ia, which &s;he had ju&s;t yielded, extends in length 200 miles along the cour&s;e of the large and navigable river Oder. A country of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite fertili|ty and highe&s;t cultivation; abound|ing with men, abounding with valu|able manufactures, and yielding a clear yearly revenue of 800,000 pounds &s;terling. The peace was hardly concluded by which &s;he re|&s;igned this valuable territory, than &s;he &s;et on foot practices for recover|ing it. She entered into a treaty with the court of Peter&s;bourg, of an innocent and &s;imply defen|&s;ive nature, &s;o far as ap|peared <NOTE PLACE="marg">May 22, 1746.</NOTE> to the public; but &s;ix &s;ecret and &s;eparate articles were added to it; one of which pro|vides, that in ca&s;e his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty &s;hould attack her maje&s;ty the Em|pre&s;s Queen; or the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;|&s;ia, or even the republick of Poland, that this attack &s;hould be con&s;idered as a breach of the treaty of Dre&s;den; that the right of the Empre&s;s Queen to Sile&s;ia ceded by that treaty &s;hould revive; and that the contracting powers &s;hould mutually furni&s;h an army of 60,000 men to re-inve&s;t the Empre&s;s Queen with that dutchy.</P>
<P>To this &s;o extraordinary a treaty, the King of Poland was invited to
<PB N="8" REF="19">
accede; and he did &s;o far accede to it, as to &s;hew he perfectly agreed in his &s;entiments with the&s;e courts. But his &s;ituation in the jaws of a formidable enemy, and the experi|ence of pa&s;&s;ed misfortunes, had ren|dered him &s;o wary, that he declined &s;igning the tre&aacute;ty; but &s;till, with the con&s;ent of the parties concerned, whom he fully convinced of his re|&s;olution to co-operate in all their mea&s;ures. He de&s;ired and they a|greed, that in the &s;ucce&s;s of their arms he &s;hould have a &s;hare in the &s;poil, on the footing of a treaty for the eventual partition of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's do|minions <NOTE PLACE="marg">May 18, 1745.</NOTE> made in the la&s;t war. On the&s;e conditions the King of Poland without actually &s;igning, was under&s;tood, and received as a party to the treaty of Peter&s;bourg.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the&s;e mea&s;ures, all &s;ort of means were employed to embroil the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's affairs in the north, and particularly to render him per&s;onall $$odious to the Czarina. When their machinations had taken full effect, and Ru&s;&s;ia was fixed in an unalterable enmity to that monarch, preparations of magazines and armies were made in Bohemia and Moravia; and the King of Poland, under pretence of a military amu&s;ement, drew toge|ther about 16000 men, with which he occupied the &s;trong and impor|tant po&s;t of Pirna. The Queen of Hungary &s;aw that &s;he &s;tood in need of yet &s;tronger &s;upports than the&s;e in the arduous bu&s;ine&s;s &s;he had un|dertaken. She found that Great-Britain, which had often done &s;o much for her di&s;tre&s;s, would do little for her ambition: &s;he therefore had recour&s;e to France, who joyfully ac|cepting an alliance, that promi&s;ed to confound the whole Germanic body, concluded a treaty with the Empre&s;s at Ver&s;ailles the 1&s;t of May 1756, a remarkable aera in the po|litical hi&s;tory of Europe.</P>
<P>The &s;ecret articles of the treaty of Peter&s;bourg, the fountain of the pre|&s;ent troubles, and the &s;teps taken to put that treaty in execution though formed and carried on with as much &s;ecrecy as earne&s;tne&s;s, could not e&s;|cape the vigilance of his Pru&s;&s;ian ma|je&s;ty, who watched all their motions, and had perfect intelligence of their mo&s;t hidden de&s;igns. When, there|fore, he perceived that by the breach between England and France, the Empre&s;s Queen would take advan|tage of the&s;e troubles to avail her|&s;elf of her alliances and her arma|ments; he ordered his mini&s;ter at Vienna to demand a clear explica|tion, and proper a&s;&s;urances concern|ing the preparations he &s;aw making: and receiving only a dry and equi|vocal an&s;wer, that the Empre&s;s had taken mea&s;ures for her own &s;ecurity and that of her allies and friends, the King believed him&s;elf no longer bound to pre&s;erve any terms; a dangerous war was to be kept out of his own territories at any rate; and being always in perfect readine&s;s for action, he fell upon Saxony with a con&s;iderable army.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t the King of Pru&s;&s;ia &s;eemed only to demand a free pa&s;|&s;age for his troops, and an <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 29.</NOTE> ob&s;ervance of the neutrality profe&s;|&s;ed by the King of Poland; but as he had very good rea&s;ons to di&s;tru&s;t &s;uch a neutrality, he demanded as a &s;ecurity, that the Saxon troops &s;hould quit the &s;trong po&s;t they oc|cupied, and di&s;per&s;e them&s;elves immediately. This demand was re|fu&s;ed, and the King of Pru&s;&s;ia in con&s;equence of that refu&s;al, imme|diately formed a &s;ort of blockade about the Saxon camp at Pirna, with a view to reduce it by famine,
<PB N="9" REF="20">
&s;ince its inacce&s;&s;ible &s;ituation render|ed an attack unadvi&s;eable. There were in Bohemia two Au&s;trian ar|mies under M. Brown and M. Picolo|mini; to keep the&s;e in awe, M. Schwerin had entered Bohemia from the county of Glatz; and M. Keith had penetrated into that kingdom on the &s;ide of Mi&s;nia. But the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, not entirely confiding in the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions; and &s;till apprehen&s;ive that M. Brown might be able to con|vey &s;ome relief to the Saxons, re|&s;olved to bring him to an action, to the &s;ucce&s;s of which he knew his own pre&s;ence would greatly contri|bute. He therefore left the blockade of the Saxon army, joined his forces under Keith, and engaged the Au&s;trians at Lowo&s;itz. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 1.</NOTE> Here he obtained a victory, which though it was not undi&s;puted with regard to the field of battle, yet with regard to the con&s;equences it was as deci&s;ive as could be wi&s;hed. M. Brown found it impracticable to relieve the Saxons, notwith&s;tanding the judicious efforts he made for that purpo&s;e; and that army, after a vain attempt to retire from their difficult po&s;t, which had one fault, that it was as difficult to leave it as to force it, were obliged to &s;urrender pri&s;oners of war. The King of Poland quitted his German domini|ons; and the Pru&s;&s;ians took up their winter quarters in Saxony, &s;eized upon the revenues, levied exorbitant contributions, and obliged the coun|try to furni&s;h recruits. This un|happy people &s;aw their country ex|hau&s;ted, and forced to bear the bur|then of a war again&s;t it&s;elf. It was then, that the King of Pru&s;&s;ia con|&s;ulting the rules of policy, more than tho&s;e of politene&s;s, made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the archives at Dre&s;den, in doing which &s;ome roughne&s;s was u&s;ed towards the Queen; but he made him&s;elf amends for the clamour in|du&s;triou&s;ly rai&s;ed on this pretence, by acquiring the originals of the&s;e pieces, which evinced to the world the reality of the de&s;ign again&s;t him, and which therefore in a great mea&s;ure ju&s;tified the means he had taken to come at them, as well as the extraordinary &s;everities he u&s;ed towards the unfor|tunate Saxons.</P>

<P>WHILST the King of Pru&s;&s;ia pa&s;&s;ed the winter in the mo&s;t vigorous preparations for carrying on the war, his ally Great Britain pre&s;ented a very different face of things. The lo&s;s of Minorca plunged the people into the utmo&s;t grief mixed with &s;hame, for &s;uch a blot on the national honour, and with indignation not only again&s;t tho&s;e who had acted weakly, but tho&s;e who had provided in&s;ufficient|ly for the relief of that important po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The public re&s;entment, which at fir&s;t &s;eemed to have no other object than Byng, was &s;oon turned again&s;t the mini&s;try. The clamour in parliament was great; without doors it was exce&s;&s;ive. Ad|dre&s;&s;es praying a &s;trict enquiry into the cau&s;e of our misfortunes, were pre&s;ented from all parts of the king|dom. The mini&s;try, notwith&s;tand|ing this general di&s;content, had a

real &s;trength; and they might have &s;tood, had they agreed among&s;t them|&s;elves. The commons could not be brought to any angry votes; and the re&s;ult of the enquiry into the lo&s;s of Minorca, was as favourable as they could have wi&s;hed. But Mr. F&mdash;thought it not advi&s;eable to bear a large proportion of the odium cau&s;ed by coun&s;els, in which he had little &s;hare. Perhaps, he thought this embarra&s;&s;ment, a &s;ituation not un|favourable to the arrangement he had always aimed at; he therefore &s;uddenly threw up an employment, which he hoped to re&s;ume augment|ed with greater power.</P>
<P>On the removal of this principal prop, the whole &s;tructure of the mi|ni&s;try fell to pieces. The D. of N. the Ld. Ch. the fir&s;t lord of the ad|miralty re&s;igned; and the chiefs of the party by who&s;e manoeuvres they were di&s;placed, naturally &s;uc|ceeded to the management <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 4. 1756.</NOTE> of affairs. They who had re&s;igned gave them no apparent op|po&s;ition in parliament; but whether it was, that the new mini&s;try were them&s;elves too fre&s;h from oppo&s;ition, and &s;ome of them too full of the po|pular manners that introduced them to court to be perfectly agreeable in the clo&s;et, or that they had made their bottom too narrow, after hold|ing their employments for &s;ome months, to the great concern of the public, they in their turn were obliged to quit their po&s;ts. Thus was the helm of go|vernment <NOTE PLACE="marg">April 5. 1757.</NOTE> a &s;econd time a|bandoned. The ca&s;e of the King and the nation was at that juncture truly deplorable. We were without any ally who could do us the lea&s;t &s;ervice, engaged in a war hitherto un&s;ucce&s;sful, with the mo&s;t formid|able power in Europe; we almo&s;t de&s;paired of our military virtue; public &s;pirit appeared utterly extin|gui&s;hed, whil&s;t the rage of faction burned with the utmo&s;t violence; our operations were totally &s;u&s;pend|ed; and having no mini&s;try e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, we had no plan to follow.</P>
<P>Three factions divided the ruling men of the nation, for the gro&s;s of the people &s;eemed to have no fur|ther views than a redre&s;s of their grievances, by whatever means that could be brought about; the fir&s;t of the&s;e factions was compo&s;ed of tho&s;e who had grown to place and power, or had formed their con|nexions under the old mini&s;try. They were &s;ome of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable per&s;ons in the nation, and had un|doubtedly the greate&s;t parliamentary intere&s;t. They had at the &s;ame time another intere&s;t hardly le&s;s con&s;ider|able, that of the monied people; but in &s;ome points, and the&s;e ma|terial too, they were weak. They were not at all popular; a matter of great con&s;ideration in a government like ours; and they were &s;uppo&s;ed by the gro&s;s of the people, not to be under the direction of great poli|tical abilities.</P>
<P>The &s;econd faction, though not &s;u&s;pected of the want of &s;ufficient ability, was yet more unpopular than the former; they had not at|tempted to pre&s;erve even the appea|rances e&s;&s;ential to popularity; and to them the more e&s;&s;ential, as their parliamentary &s;trength was, how|ever re&s;pectable, much inferior to the fir&s;t. If their influence at one court was able to ballance that of the old mini&s;try, by means of a then powerful connection, that very con|nection made them far wor&s;e at ano|ther court, and wor&s;e with the ge|nerality of the people, who enter|tained or pretended at lea&s;t to enter|tain, &s;u&s;picions of a nature the more dangerous, as they were only drop|ped
<PB N="11" REF="22">
in hints and whi&s;pers, and never could come to a full and open expla|nation.</P>
<P>The third party, had little par|liamentary and le&s;s court influence; but they had a prodigious populari|ty, which &s;upplied every other de|fect. The abilities of their leader were of the mo&s;t &s;hining kind; his application equal to his abilities; his di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s was confe&s;&s;ed by his enemies; and though it would have &s;hined in the days of heroi&s;m, was now the more valued, and &s;et off to the greater advantage by the general &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s which prevailed among the men of bu&s;ine&s;s. The nation repo&s;ed the mo&s;t perfect obedience in his integrity and love to his country. This party, con&s;cious where its &s;trength lay, cultivated with great care the popularity which was the ba&s;is of their power; even perhaps &s;o as to impair on &s;ome occa&s;ions the dignity of government.</P>
<P>The&s;e three factions differed from each other extremely with regard to power, the grand object of all fac|tions. But in the general &s;cheme of their politics, the two fir&s;t were pretty much agreed. Looking on France as the mo&s;t con&s;tant and mo&s;t dangerous enemy of Great Britain, they dreaded the increa&s;e of her power and influence among the neighbouring nations as the greate&s;t of all evils. To prevent &s;o danger|ous an aggrandi&s;ement, they thought it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve a con&s;tant attention to the ballance of power, and to &s;eek our particular &s;afety and liberty in the general &s;afe|ty and liberty of Europe. A clo&s;e connection was therefore to be kept up with the powers of the conti|nent, not only by continual negoti|ations, but by large &s;ub&s;idies, and even by a&s;&s;i&s;ting them with our troops if the occa&s;ion &s;hould require &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance. For this purpo&s;e, as well as to &s;ecure the more effectual|ly our pre&s;ent happy e&s;tabli&s;hment, a con&s;iderable regular land force ought to be con&s;tantly maintained. Our navy, they thought, ought by no means to be neglected; but it was only to be cultivated and em|ployed &s;ub&s;erviently to the more comprehen&s;ive continental &s;y&s;tem. The&s;e parties were far from being friends to arbitrary power, or in any &s;ort aver&s;e to parliaments; they loved the con&s;titution; but they were for pre&s;erving the authority of govern|ment entire, and in its utmo&s;t lawful force. To make government more ea&s;y, knowing that many would di|&s;turb it, from di&s;affection or di&s;gu&s;t, or mi&s;taken notions of liberty, they thought it ju&s;t to rule men by their in|tere&s;ts if they could not by their vir|tues, and they had long been in the practice of procuring a majority in parliament, by the di&s;tribution of the numerous lucrative places and em|ployments which our con&s;titution leaves in the di&s;po&s;al of the Crown. Several believed that no other method was practicable, con&s;idering the nature of mankind, and our particular form of government.</P>
<P>But the third and popular party, was influenced by different principles. They looked indeed on the power of France in the &s;ame light with the two former, and were of the &s;ame opinion concerning the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;etting bounds to it. In the means of attaining this end they differed. Our &s;ituation they thought dictated a narrower, but a more natural, a &s;afer, and a le&s;s expen&s;ive plan of politics, than that which had been adopted by the other party. We ought never to forget, &s;aid they, that we are an i&s;land: and that this cir|cum&s;tance &s;o favourable both to our political and to our civil liberty, pre|&s;cribes
<PB N="12" REF="23">
to us a conduct very different from that of every other nation. Our natural &s;trength is a maritime &s;trength, as trade is our natural employment; the&s;e mu&s;t always go hand in hand, and they mutually &s;upport each other. But, if turning our back to our real intere&s;ts, and abandoning our natural element, we enter that inextricable labyrinth of continental politicks; if we make our&s;elves par|ties in every controver&s;y; if we ex|hau&s;t our wealth in purcha&s;ing the u&s;ele&s;s and precarious friend&s;hip of every petty prince or &s;tate; if we wa&s;te the blood of our people in all the quarrels that may ari&s;e on the continent; &s;o far from going in the right way to reduce France, that we attack her on the &s;trong &s;ide, and only de&s;troy our&s;elves by our ill judged efforts again&s;t the enemy. That we can have nothing to fear from the &s;uperiority of France on the continent, whil&s;t we pre&s;erve our &s;uperiority at &s;ea; that we can always cut the &s;inews of the enemy's &s;trength by de&s;troying their traffic; that to fear an inva&s;ion from a power weak in its marine, is the idle&s;t of all fears; that in ca&s;e an inva&s;ion were po&s;&s;ible, a well trained national militia, &s;upplying by their zeal the defects of their di&s;|cipline, would prove our be&s;t pro|tection; that a &s;tanding army is in whatever &s;hape dangerous to free|dom; and that a government like ours, connected by its very e&s;&s;ence with the liberty of the &s;ubject, can never be in want of the &s;upports of de&s;potic power. As little is parlia|mentary influence nece&s;&s;ary. A go|vernment plea&s;ing to the people, as every good government mu&s;t be, can never be generally oppo&s;ed; and men need no bribes to per&s;uade them to their duty.</P>
<P>The&s;e notions, &s;o oppo&s;ite in their extreams, might be reconciled in a medium, and u&s;ed to temper each other. For as, on one hand, it would be very ab&s;urd to make no &s;ort of advantage of our in&s;ular &s;ituation, but to engage in all the bu&s;ine&s;s of the continent without re&s;erve, and to plunge our&s;elves into real evils out of dread of po&s;&s;ible mi&s;chiefs; &s;o on the other hand, to think our&s;elves wholly unconcerned in the fortunes of our neighbours on the continent, or to think of aiding them in any ca&s;e, only by the way of diver&s;ion with our fleets, would be a way of proceeding, &s;till more extravagant than the former. If &s;uch notions were reduced to practice, we might &s;oon lo&s;e all the&s;e advantages derived from a &s;ituation which we abu&s;ed.</P>
<P>The rea&s;onablene&s;s of &s;uch a tem|perament, could not be perceived during the ferment of that time, in which the&s;e topics were bandied to and fro with infinite heat. The re|&s;ignation, or rather deprivation, of the popular mini&s;try, only increa&s;ed their popularity, and the general di&s;content; the people could not believe that good mea&s;ures could be pur&s;ued, when tho&s;e, in whom alone they confided, were not employed; almo&s;t all the corporations of the kingdom pre&s;ented the deprived mini&s;ters with their freedom, and addre&s;&s;ed them in the warme&s;t man|ner, te&s;tifying the mo&s;t entire ap|probation of their conduct, and the &s;incere&s;t concern to &s;ee them out of employment.</P>
<P>This conflict between an old e&s;ta|bli&s;hed intere&s;t, and the torrent of popularity, continued for a long time, and the nation was almo&s;t ruined by it. It is not ea&s;y, nor perhaps quite proper, to attempt to trace the &s;teps by which &s;o happy a coalition, as we have &s;een take place, was brought about. But it was formed in &s;uch
<PB N="13" REF="24">
manner, has held together with &s;uch &s;olidity, and produced &s;uch excel|lent effects, as I believe the mo&s;t &s;anguine could not <NOTE PLACE="marg">June 29. 1757.</NOTE> have hop'd for at that time. Mr. P. was again re&s;tored to the of|fice of &s;ecretary of &s;tate, the D. of N. was placed at the head of the trea&s;ury, Mr. F. was appointed pay|ma&s;ter of the forces. This arrange|ment, which gave very general &s;atis|faction, was however di&s;liked by tho&s;e, whom their violent attach|ment to their party had in&s;pired with a narrow and exclu&s;ive &s;pirit. It was the be&s;t mea&s;ure, becau&s;e it was an healing mea&s;ure; and it was little le&s;s than impo&s;&s;ible for any particular party to carry on public bu&s;ine&s;s on its &s;ingle bottom.</P>
<P>It was high time that our dome&s;tic di&s;&s;entions &s;hould be compos'd at la&s;t. From every quarter of the world, in which we had any concern, we heard of nothing but <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 14. 1756.</NOTE> lo&s;&s;es and calamities. In America we lo&s;t the Fort of O&s;wego. That fort, &s;ituated at the mouth of the Onondaga river, commanded a commodious harbour on the Lake Ontario. It was built by General Shirley, and de&s;igned to cover the country of the Five Nations; to &s;ecure the Indian trade; to interrupt the communication between the French northern and &s;outhern e&s;tabli&s;h|ments; and to open a way to our arms to attack the forts of Frontenac and Niagara. For the&s;e purpo&s;es, &s;ome frigates had been fitted out for crui&s;ing, and a number of boats prepared for the tran&s;portation of troops; but they all fell to the ene|my with the fort, where 100 pieces of cannon were, and a con&s;i|derable quantity of provi&s;ion. 1600 men were made pri&s;oners of war. The place made but a trifling re&s;i&s;t|ance, &s;carce holding out three days; the attempts to relieve it were too late. The French demoli&s;hed the fort.</P>
<P>Our lo&s;&s;es were not confin'd to A|merica. The E. India company recei|ved a blow, which would have &s;haken an e&s;tabli&s;hment of le&s;s &s;trength to its foundations. The news of the war between France and Eng|land had not yet reached India, but a new and very formidable enemy was rai&s;ed up in that quarter. The Nabob of Bengal (the Nabobs are a &s;pecies of viceroys to the Grand Mo|gul, grown almo&s;t independent in their &s;everal provinces,) irritated at the protection given to one of his &s;ubjects in the Engli&s;h fort of Cal|cutta, and, as it is &s;aid, at the refu|&s;al of &s;ome duties to which he claim|ed a right, levied a great army, and laid &s;iege to that place. The Gover|nor, terrified by the numbers of the enemy, abandoned the fort with &s;e|veral of the principal per&s;ons in the &s;ettlement, who &s;aved them&s;elves with their mo&s;t valuable effects on board the &s;hips.</P>
<P>Thus de&s;erted, Mr. Hollwel, the &s;econd in command, bravely held the place to the la&s;t extremity, with a few gallant friends, and the re|mains of a feeble garri&s;on. A very noble defence was in&s;ufficient to keep an untenable place, or to affect an ungenerous enemy. The fort was taken, and the gar|ri&s;on <NOTE PLACE="marg">June 26.</NOTE> being made pri&s;oners, were thru&s;t into a narrow dun|geon. Hollwel, with a few others, came out alive, to paint a &s;cene of the mo&s;t cruel di&s;tre&s;s which perhaps human nature ever &s;uffered. The Ea&s;t India company lo&s;t their princi|pal &s;ettlement in Bengal, and a fort, which &s;ecured to them the mo&s;t va|luable part of their trade.</P>
<P>In the &s;pace of this unfortunate year, we were &s;tripped of Minorca
<PB N="14" REF="25">
and O&s;wego; we apprehended an inva&s;ton of Great Britain it&s;elf: our councils were torn to pieces by fac|tions; and our military fame was every where in contempt. Amid&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 13.</NOTE> the&s;e lo&s;&s;es, we con&s;idered as &s;ome advantage the re|duction of the principal fort of An|gria, a piratical prince, who had been many years trouble&s;ome to the Engli&s;h trade in the Ea&s;t Indies. This &s;ervice was performed by Ad|miral Wat&s;on in the beginning of the year.</P>

<P>WHAT turn the Engli&s;h poli|tics were like to take in the year 1757, &s;eemed for &s;ome time uncertain. The new mini&s;try did not &s;eem well e&s;tabli&s;hed; nor was it well known, whether they would pur&s;ue the plans and pre&s;erve the connections of the old. Abroad, every thing was prepared for open|ing the campaign with the utmo&s;t eclat. All Europe was in motion.</P>
<P>France, in order to demon&s;trate to the Queen of Hungary, the advan|tageous choice &s;he had made in con|necting her&s;elf with the hou&s;e of Bourbon, formed two great armies. The fir&s;t was compo&s;ed of near 80,000 men, the flower of the French troops, attended with a va&s;t artillery, and commanded by M. de Etrees, a General of the be&s;t e&s;ta|bli&s;hed reputation &s;he had in her &s;ervice. Under him &s;erved M. de Contades, M. Chevert, and the Count de St. Germain, all officers of high character, and all fit to com|mand in chief, if M. de Etrees had not been appointed to that emi|nence. This formidable army pa&s;|&s;ed the Rhine, and marched by We&s;tphalia, in order to invade the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's dominions in qua|lity of allies to the Empre&s;s Queen, and guardians of the liberties of the Empire, and to no other in|tent, as it was pretended; but in re|ality, with a view to reduce Hano|ver al&s;o. They judged that their ope|rations again&s;t the King of Pru&s;&s;ia might be executed, and their &s;cheme to drive the King of England into &s;ome conce&s;&s;ions with regard to A|merica, might be compleated by one and the &s;ame blow. The &s;econd army was commanded by the Prince de Soubi&s;e; it con&s;i&s;ted of about 25,000 men. This army was de|&s;tined to &s;trengthen the Imperial army of execution; but before it had pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine, it made it&s;elf ma&s;ter of Cleves, Meurs and Gueldres, whil&s;t a detachment from d' Etrees's army &s;eized upon the town of Emb|den, and whatever el&s;e belonged to Pru&s;&s;ia in Ea&s;t Frie&s;land.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the King of Pru&s;&s;ia had entered Saxony in the beginning of the preceding &s;ummer, proce&s;s was commenced again&s;t him in the Em|peror's Aulic council, and before the diet of the Empire. It is not difficult to conceive how the affair mu&s;t have been decided; when tho&s;e who feared the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, be|lieved they had a fair opportunity to reduce him: and when tho&s;e who feared the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, were, by that very fear, obliged to
<PB N="15" REF="26">
&s;upport the power they dreaded: accu&s;tomed as they were to the in|fluence of a family in which the Empire had &s;o long been in a man|ner hereditary; and overawed by the appearance of a confederacy, the mo&s;t formidable the world had ever yet &s;een. Accordingly the King of Pru&s;&s;ia was condemned for contu|macy; and the Fi&s;cal had orders to notify to him that he was put under the ban of the Empire, and adjudged fallen from all the dignities and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions which he held under it. The circles of the Empire were ordered to furni&s;h their contingents of men and money to put this &s;entence in execution; but the contingents were collected &s;lowly, the troops were badly compo&s;ed, and probably this army had never been able to act, if it had not been for the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance afforded under the Prince de Soubi&s;e.</P>
<P>The Au&s;trians who were princi|pals in the quarrel, were not behind their auxiliaries in the greatne&s;s of their preparations; they made the mo&s;t &s;trenuous efforts, by which they a&s;&s;embled a body of upwards of 100,000 men in Bohemia, and committed the command to Prince Charles of Lorrain, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by M. Brown. In the north all things threatened the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. The Czarina, true to her re&s;entments and her engagements, had &s;ent a body of 60,000 men commanded by M. Apraxin, who were in full march to invade the ducal Pru&s;&s;ia, whil&s;t a a &s;trong fleet was equipped in the Baltick, to co-operate with that ar|my. Although the King of Swe|den was allied in blood and inclinati|on to his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty, yet the jealou&s;y which the Senate entertained of their &s;overeign; the hope of re|covering their ancient profe&s;&s;ions in Pomerania by means of the pre&s;ent troubles, and in fine their old attach|ment to France newly cemented by intrigues and &s;ub&s;idies, made their ill inclinations to the cau&s;e of Pru&s;&s;ia more than &s;u&s;picious. Hitherto in|deed nothing more than the tendency of their councils was fully known. The Duke of Mecklenbourg took the &s;ame party, and agreed to join the Swedi&s;h army when it &s;hould be a&s;&s;embled, with 6000 men; a pro|ceeding which he has &s;ince had rea|&s;on to repent bitterly. Thus were the forces of five mighty &s;tates <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Au&s;tria, Ru&s;&s;ia, France, Sweden, the Empire.</NOTE>, each of which had in their turn been a terror to all Europe, united to re|duce the heir of the Marqui&s;&s;es of Brandenbourg; and in &s;uch a point of danger and glory, had the great and formidable abilities of his Pru&s;|&s;ian maje&s;ty placed him, with lit|tle, in compari&s;on, that could en|able him to &s;u&s;tain the violence of &s;o many &s;hocks, except what tho&s;e abilities &s;upplied. But his a&s;toni&s;hing oeconomy, the incom|parable order of his finances, the di&s;cipline of his armies beyond all prai&s;e, a &s;agacity that fore&s;aw every thing, a vigilance that attended every thing, a con&s;tancy that no labour could &s;ubdue, a courage that no danger could di&s;may, an intultive glance that catches the deci&s;ive mo|ment, all the&s;e &s;eemed to form a &s;ort of ballance to the va&s;t weight again&s;t him, turned the wi&s;hes of his friends into hopes, and made them depend upon re&s;ources that are not within the power of calculation.</P>
<P>The only army that appeared in his favour was a body of between 30 and 40,000 Hanoverians and He&s;&s;ians, who with &s;ome reinforce|ments of his own troops, formed an
<PB N="16" REF="27">
army of ob&s;ervation, commanded by his Royal Highne&s;s the Duke of Cumberland; this army was po&s;ted on the We&s;er, to watch the motions of M. d'Etrees. The va&s;t and un|wieldy body of the French, encum|bered as the French armies always are by an immen&s;e baggage and an innumerable multitude of mouths without hands, made a very &s;low progre&s;s through the rough and barren country that lies between the Rhine and the We&s;er. All the abi|lities of the French general were employed in finding &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for his troops. His Royal Highne&s;s on the other hand, di&s;played great a|bilities in throwing all po&s;&s;ible im|pediments in his way. But when the&s;e impediments were removed by the &s;uperiority of numbers, the Hanoverian army gradually gave way, yielding to that &s;uperiority, and the French troops pa&s;&s;ed the We&s;er without oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>In the mean time, his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty being determined according to his maxim, to lay the cloth as far from home as po&s;&s;ible; made his di&s;po&s;itions for carrying the war in|to Bohemia as &s;peedily as the &s;ea&s;on would admit. Three great bodies of his troops entered into that kingdom by three very different ways, but nearly at the &s;ame time. M. Schwerin penetrated into it from Sile&s;ia. The Prince of Bevern en|tered with the corps under his com|mand from Lu&s;atia, and defeated as a preliminary to a more deci&s;ive victory, a body of 28,000 Au&s;trians who oppo&s;ed him. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Apr. 21.</NOTE> The King him&s;elf prepared to enter Bohemia at a great di&s;tance from the corps commanded by the&s;e generals; and as he &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to march towards Egra, the enemy imagined he intended to execute &s;ome de&s;ign di&s;tinct from the object of his other armies. With this idea they de|tached a body of 20,000 men, to ob&s;erve his motions. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia finding that this feint had all its effect, made a &s;udden and ma&s;|terly movement to his left, by which he cut off all communication be|tween that detachment and the main army of the Au&s;trians. Spirited with this advantage, he pu&s;hed on|wards with the utmo&s;t rapidity to Prague, where he joined the corps under the Prince of Bevern and M. Schwerin, who had advanced with inconceivable diligence to meet him. Never were operations executed with more judgment, celerity and &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The Au&s;trian army was little &s;hort of 100,000 men, and the &s;ituation of their <NOTE PLACE="marg">May 6.</NOTE> camp, fortified by every advantage of nature, and every contrivance of art, &s;uch as on common occa&s;i|ons might ju&s;tly be con&s;idered as impregnable; but the Pru&s;&s;ians, be|ing nearly as numerous as the ene|my, in&s;pired by a &s;ociety of danger with their King, and filled with that noble enthu&s;ia&s;m, which, whil&s;t it urges to daring enterpri&s;es, almo&s;t en&s;ures their &s;ucce&s;s, pa&s;&s;ed mo|ra&s;&s;es, climbed precipices, faced batteries, and after a bloody and ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, totally defeated the Au&s;trians. They took their camp, military che&s;t, cannon, all the trophies of a complete victory. The lo&s;s on the &s;ide of the vic|tor, as well as the vanqui&s;hed, was very great; but both &s;ides had yet a greater lo&s;s in the death of two of the be&s;t Generals in Europe. M. Schwerin was killed at the age of eighty-two, with the colonel's &s;tandard in his hand at the head of his regiment. M. Brown received a wound, which, from the chagrin he &s;uffered rather than from its own nature, proved mortal.</P>

About 40,000 of the Au&s;trian ar|my took refuge in Prague. The re&s;t fled different ways. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia lo&s;t no time to inve&s;t the place, and to cut off all &s;uccours. If on one hand &s;uch an immen&s;e garri&s;on made an attack unadvi&s;ea|ble, on the other that formidable number it&s;elf &s;eemed to make the reduction of the place by famine the more certain. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia not relying &s;olely on this, prepared to bombard the town. On the 29th of May, at midnight, after a mo&s;t dreadful &s;torm of rain and thunder, as if it were to di&s;play how much more ruinous the malice of men may be, than the greate&s;t terrors of nature, on the &s;ignal of a rocket, four batteries, which di&s;|charged every twenty-four hours two hundred and eighty-eight bombs, be&s;ides a va&s;t multitude of red hot balls, began to pour de&s;truction on that unfortunate city, which was &s;oon in flames in every part. The garri&s;on made a vigorous defence, and one well conducted and de&s;pe|rate &s;ally: but they were repul&s;ed with great lo&s;s. The principal ma|gi&s;trates, burghers, and clergy, &s;ee|ing their city on the point of being reduced to an heap of rubbi&s;h, made the mo&s;t moving &s;upplications to the commander to li&s;ten to terms. The commander was deaf to their prayers. Twelve thou&s;and of the mo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s mouths were driven out of the city. The Pru&s;&s;ians forced them in again. The affairs of the Empre&s;s &s;eemed verging to inevitable de&s;truction; a whole army was upon the point of &s;urrendering pri&s;oners of war; the capital of Bohemia on the point of being taken, and with it all the re&s;t of that flouri&s;hing kingdom. The &s;anguine friends of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia began to compute the di&s;tance to Vienna.</P>
<P>In this de&s;perate &s;ituation of af|fairs, Leopold Count Daun entered on the &s;tage, and began to turn the fortune of the war. This General never had commanded in chief be|fore; but he was formed, by a long cour&s;e of experience in various parts of Europe, under the greate&s;t Gene|rals and in the mo&s;t illu&s;trious &s;cenes of action. Though of a very noble family, he had without the lea&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance from court favour, ri&s;en in&s;en&s;ibly by the &s;low gradation of mere merit, with much e&s;teem and without any noi&s;e. This General arrived within a few miles of Prague, the day after the great battle. He collected the fugitive parties of the Au&s;trian army, and retired to a po&s;t of great &s;trength, from whence he fed the troops in Prague with hopes of relief. But as no man better un|der&s;tood the &s;uperiority of the Pru&s;|&s;ian troops, and as he was &s;en&s;ible of the impre&s;&s;ion which the late defeat had left upon his men, he carefully avoided to precipitate mat|ters by an ha&s;ty action. He knew that the &s;ituation he had cho&s;en would embarra&s;s the Pru&s;&s;ians; that a large party of their army mu&s;t be always employed to watch him; that this would weaken their efforts again&s;t the great body &s;hut up in Prague, whil&s;t his own forces gained time to recover their &s;pirits, and to increa&s;e in &s;trength by the daily &s;uccours, which his court exerted all their powers to &s;end him: with the&s;e ideas he waited in his entrenched camp at Colin, to act as events &s;hould direct.</P>
<P>The King of Pru&s;&s;ia was not le&s;s &s;en&s;ible than Count Daun of the ef|fect of this conduct. He determin|ed at all adventures to di&s;lodge him from the po&s;t he held; but whether it was that the King feared to weak|en his army, which had actually an
<PB N="18" REF="29">
army to be&s;iege, or whether he was blinded by a train of uniform &s;uc|ce&s;s, which made him believe his arms irre&s;i&s;tible under every di&s;ad|vantage, or whatever were his mo|tives or nece&s;&s;ities, the whole army employed in this undertaking, in|cluding the Prince of Bevern's corps, did not exceed 32,000 men, caval|ry and infantry; and with the&s;e he was to attack 60,000 men, in one of the &s;tronge&s;t &s;itu|ations <NOTE PLACE="marg">June 18.</NOTE> which could be cho&s;en, and defended by a va&s;t train of artillery. Whatever the mo&s;t impetuous and well regulated courage, whatever an ardor in&s;pired by the remem|brance of &s;o many victories could do towards overcoming every kind of di&s;advantage, was done by the Pru&s;&s;ians on this occa&s;ion. They returned to the attack &s;even times: in none of their victorious battles had their bravery been more con|&s;picuous. Both the King's bro|thers were in the field; and they did every thing that could be ex|pected from the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's brothers. The King him&s;elf at the head of his cavalry, made one furious and concluding charge. E|very thing was tried, and every thing was un&s;ucce&s;sful. The want of a &s;ufficiently numerous infantry, in a ground where his cavalry could not &s;upport them, the want of an e|qual artillery, the advantageous &s;itu|ation of the enemy, their numbers, their bravery, their General, obliged the King of Pru&s;&s;ia to quit the field. What his lo&s;s was is not &s;o certain; it was undoubtedly great in the ac|tion, but &s;till greater by de&s;ertions, and the innumerable ill con&s;equences that follow a defeat.</P>
<P>Though the King of Pru&s;&s;ia was defeated in this battle, and though he brought on his defeat, in a great mea|&s;ure, by &s;ome errors of his own, yet whatever &s;mall blemi&s;h his military &s;kill might have &s;uffered, his repu|tation was rai&s;ed higher than ever, in the opinion of all judicious men, by the noble and candid manner in which he acknowledged his mi&s;|take, by the firmne&s;s with which he bore his misfortune, and by tho&s;e a&s;toni&s;hing &s;trokes of genius and heroi&s;m, by which he retriev|ed his lo&s;s. The &s;miles of fortune make conquerors; it is her malice which di&s;covers heroes.</P>

<P>NEVER was the old ob&s;erva|tion, <HI>une bataille perdue a un mauvais cu,</HI> more verified than in the con&s;equences of the unfortunate battle of Colin. Though the King retired unpur&s;ued by his enemies, he was obliged to rejoin his own army before Prague without delay, and to rai&s;e the blockade of that place. The impri&s;oned Au&s;trians with joy received Count Daun their deliverer, and their united forces became greatly &s;uperior to the Pru&s;&s;ians. The King was in a &s;hort time obliged to evacuate Bohemia, and take refuge in Saxony. The
<PB N="19" REF="30">
Au&s;trians hara&s;&s;ed him as much as po&s;&s;ible; but their armies, notwith|&s;tanding their great &s;uperiority, were not in a condition from their late &s;uf|ferings to make any deci&s;ive attempt upon him, as the frontiers of Saxony a|bound with &s;ituations ea&s;ily defended.</P>
<P>The King of Pru&s;&s;ia's misfortunes now poured in upon him at once, and from every quarter. The army commanded by the Duke of Cum|berland, who continually retired be|fore the French, after they had pa&s;&s;ed the We&s;er, came however to a re&s;o|lution to make a &s;tand at Ha&s;tenbeck, within a few miles of Hammelen, where it was judged that the &s;uperior numbers of the enemy might be the lea&s;t prejudicial; but notwith&s;tand|ing the advantage of the &s;ituation, the bravery of the Hanoverians, and the conduct of the Duke, the allied army was driven from the field of battle, and retreated towards Stade. By taking this route <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 25.</NOTE> his Royal Highne&s;s was driven into a &s;ort of <HI>cul de &s;ac.</HI> Unable by his &s;itu|ation to retire, or by his &s;trength to advance, he was compelled to &s;ign the remarkable capitulation of Clo&s;ter-&s;even, by which <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sep. 8.</NOTE> Hanoverians laid down their <NOTE PLACE="marg">38000</NOTE> arms, and were di&s;per&s;ed into diffe|rent quarters of cantonment. The French army had a little be|fore this changed its com|mander. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 6.</NOTE> D'Etrees, the favourite of all the military men, was removed from the command, which was con|ferred on the Duke de Richlieu, who excelled him and all mankind in the profe&s;&s;ion of a courtier. The Ha|noverians were now quite &s;ubdued, and all the French force, let loo&s;e by this treaty, was ready to fall in upon the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's domi|nions.</P>
<P>An enterprize was concerted in England again&s;t the coa&s;t of France, to make a diver&s;ion in his favour, by drawing a part of the French army to the defence of their own country. England propo&s;ed to com|pa&s;s another great de&s;ign, and which &s;he had equally at heart, by the ex|pedition, which was to give an effectual blow to the marine of France. The de&s;tination of this ar|mament was kept a profound &s;e|cret, and whil&s;t it exerci&s;ed the pe|netration of all the politicians of Eu|rope, it filled France with the mo&s;t &s;erious alarms. The Engli&s;h fleet at la&s;t appeared before Roch|fort. Some time was &s;pent <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sep. 21.</NOTE> before it could be re&s;olved what plan was to be followed in the attack; at la&s;t it was re&s;olved to &s;ecure the &s;mall i&s;le of Aix, from whence &s;ome ob|&s;truction was apprehended to their landing. The i&s;land was &s;oon redu|ced; but as a good deal of time was con&s;umed in the&s;e deliberations and actions, the militia of the country had time to gather, and there was an appearance of two camps on the &s;hore. The commanders now took into con&s;ideration the badne&s;s of the coa&s;t, the danger of landing, the time the enemy had to put the place in &s;uch a po&s;ture of defence, as might make any &s;udden attempt, or <HI>coup de main,</HI> un&s;ucce&s;sful: in con&s;equence of the&s;e deliberations, they unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved to return without making <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sep. 29.</NOTE> any attempt. The di&s;appoint|ment of the nation was equal to the &s;anguine hopes we had con|ceived; nothing could exceed the general di&s;content. The mi|litary men blamed the plan of the expedition. The Mini&s;ters, and with them the public voice, ex|claimed at the execution. A <HI>court of enquiry,</HI> of officers of reputation, cen&s;ured the commander; a <HI>court|martial,</HI> of officers of reputation,
<PB N="20" REF="31">
acquitted him. The expedition &s;erv|ed only in England to increa&s;e and imbitter our di&s;&s;entions, and to turn our attention to vain di&s;putes. It did nothing towards relieving the King of Pru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>The Ru&s;&s;ians, who had made for a long time a dilatory march, and &s;eemed uncertain of their own re&s;o|lutions, all at once ha&s;tened their motions. They entered the Ducal Pru&s;&s;ia under M. Apraxin and Ge|neral Fermer, and marked their progre&s;s by a thou&s;and inhuman cruelties. A large body of Au&s;tri|ans entered Sile&s;ia, and penetrated as far as Bre&s;lau. Then they made a turn backwards, and laid &s;iege to the important fortre&s;s of Schweid|nitz, ju&s;tly con&s;idered as the key of that dutchy, which was the cau&s;e of the war. Another body enter|ed Lu&s;atia, and made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Zittau. Twenty-two thou&s;and Swedes pierced into the Pru&s;&s;ian Pomerania, took the towns of Anclam and Demmein, and laid the whole country under contribu|tion. Richlieu, freed from all op|po&s;ition on the &s;ide of Hanover, made his way into Halber&s;tad, and the old marche of Brandenburg, fir&s;t exacting contributions, and then plundering the towns. The army of the Empire, reinforced by that of Prince de Soubi&s;e, after many delays, was at la&s;t on full march to enter Saxony; this left the Au&s;trians at liberty to turn the greate&s;t part of their forces to the reduction of Sile&s;ia. General Haddick pierced through Lu&s;atia, pa&s;&s;ed by the Pru&s;&s;ian armies, and, &s;uddenly pre|&s;enting him&s;elf before the gates of Berlin, laid the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's capital under contribution; and though he retired on the approach of a body of Pru&s;&s;ians, yet he &s;till kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his former po&s;t, in order to interrupt the communica|tion of the King with Sile&s;ia. The fate which &s;eemed to have threat|ened the Empre&s;s &s;ome months ago, was now looked upon as the cer|tain lot of her antagoni&s;t. All his endeavours to retrieve his affairs had hitherto been equally brave and un&s;ucce&s;sful. General Lehwald had orders at any hazard to engage the Ru&s;&s;ians: with thirty thou&s;and he attacked double that number &s;trongly entrenched, at a place called Norkitten; but <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 30.</NOTE> after &s;everal of tho&s;e won|derful efforts, which the Pru&s;&s;ians alone know how to make, he was compelled to retire; but he retired in excellent order, without being pur&s;ued, having killed five times more of the enemy, than he had lo&s;t of his own men, and more for|midable after his defeat, than the Ru&s;&s;ians after their victory. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia exerted him&s;elf upon every &s;ide; his enemies almo&s;t al|ways fled before him; but whil&s;t he pur&s;ued one body, another gained in &s;ome other part upon him, and the winter came on fa&s;t, as his &s;trength decayed, and his adver&s;aries mul|tiplied from every quarter. The following letter, which appeared in the public papers about this time, paints the condition of that di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed monarch, in &s;o full a man|ner, that I &s;hall attempt no other de|&s;cription of it.</P>
<P>"Many per&s;ons, who &s;aw the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, when he pa&s;&s;ed lately through Leip&s;ic, cannot expre&s;s how much he is altered. They &s;ay he is &s;o much worn away, that they &s;carce knew him. This, indeed, is not to be wondered at; he hath not a body of iron, like Charles XII. and he endures as great fa|tigues as he did. He is as much on hor&s;eback as Charles was, and
<PB N="21" REF="32">
often lies upon the ground. His inward &s;ufferings cannot be le&s;s than his outward: let us ca&s;t our eyes on a map of the Pru&s;&s;ian domi|nions; and mea&s;ure what he hath left of the many fair po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions he had in the month of April la&s;t, of which a &s;pace of &s;even months hath &s;tript him. Whence can he have men? he is &s;hut out from the Empire; and from whence can be draw money? the dutchy of Guel|ders, the dutchy of Cleves, the principality of Moers, the county of Lingen, the county of Lip&s;tadt, the principality of Minden, Ea&s;t-Frie&s;land, Embden, and its infant company, part of the archbi&s;hop|rick of Magdeburgh, &s;ome other parts of the marche, Ducal Pomera|nia, a great part of Sile&s;ia, a great part of the kingdom of Pru&s;&s;ia, Berlin it&s;elf, almo&s;t all his domi|nions, in &s;hort, are either taken from him, or laid under contribu|tion, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by his enemies, who collect the publick revenues, fatten on the contributions, and with the money which they draw from the electorate of Hanover, and other conque&s;ts defray the ex|pences of the war. This picture certainly differs greatly from that which the King of Pru&s;&s;ia might have &s;ketched out, the day he took arms to enter Saxony. Add to this the Duke of Cumberland's conven|tion, which deprived him of all his allies, and left him without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance whatever, excepting four or five hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, which the Briti&s;h parlia|ment may give him.

<P>THIS was the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's &s;ituation, when the will of Providence, and his own wonder|ful abilities, as wonderfully chang|ed the &s;cene. His maje&s;ty deferred to bring on a deci&s;ive action, di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed as his affairs were, until the approach of winter; had he march|ed to attack the Imperial army, whil&s;t it was at a con&s;iderable di|&s;tance, he mu&s;t either have left Saxony expo&s;ed to the in&s;ults of the Au&s;trian parties, or have greatly weakened his own forces employed in the principal action. He therefore &s;uffered the army of the Empire to advance to the frontiers of Mi&s;nia, and even to threaten the &s;iege of Leip&s;ic, before he began to act again&s;t them: he however moved towards them, leaving an army in Lu&s;atia to ob&s;erve the Au&s;tri|ans. On his fir&s;t motions, the enemy retired with precipitation. But when they had reinforced them&s;elves with numbers and courage &s;ufficient to per|&s;uade them to advance, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia in his turn retired. His re&s;o|lution &s;eemed to have been to fight as near Mi&s;nia as po&s;&s;ible, and as deep in the winter as he conveniently might; for if he &s;hould have the good for|tune to &s;ucceed again&s;t the Imperial army, &s;uch a blow, at &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on, would effectually di&s;able them from acting any thing to his prejudice, for that year at lea&s;t; but if, on the contrary, he &s;hould fail, Saxony
<PB N="22" REF="33">
was at hand, in which it would prove difficult for the enemy to make any impre&s;&s;ion whil&s;t the winter continued. As for the time to be lo&s;t by following this plan, and the advantage it would afford the Au&s;trians in their de&s;igns on Sile&s;ia, they were not to be com|pared with the advantages which the King received from it. He knew that Schweidnitz was &s;trong, and excellently provided; the Prince of Bevern was &s;trongly po&s;ted near it to ob&s;truct the enemy's ope|rations; the winter would lean hea|vier on the be&s;iegers; and on the whole, he had rea&s;on to tru&s;t that his troops, animated by his own pre&s;ence and example, would prove far &s;uperior to the enemy, in endur|ing all the hard&s;hips of a winter cam|paign.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time &s;pent in various movements, between the allied army of the Imperiali&s;ts and French on one &s;ide, and the Pru&s;|&s;ians on the other, the King re&s;olv|ed to give battle to his enemies, who were now advanced to the confines of Mi&s;nia. On the 24th of October, the King had taken his re&s;olution; at that time his ar|my happened to be divided into &s;everal corps, &s;ome of them at a di&s;tance of no le&s;s than twenty leagues a&s;under; yet &s;uch were the &s;pirit and excellent di&s;po&s;ition of the Pru&s;&s;ians, that the junction of all the&s;e corps was fully effected on the 27th, and the King advanced towards the enemy. The enemy fell back at his approach, and repa&s;&s;ed the Sala; they were followed clo&s;e. The two armies met near the village of Ro&s;bach. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 5.</NOTE></P>
<P>The united army, commanded by the Prince of Saxe Hilburghau&s;en and the Prince of Soubi&s;e, was 50,000 men compleat. But the troops of the Circles were new rai&s;ed, and many of them not well affected to the &s;ervice, nor to their French allies. The Pru&s;&s;ians did not amount to 25,000; but then they were Pru&s;&s;ians, and led on by the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. As &s;oon as the armies were formed, and the battle going to begin, which was to de|cide the fate of &s;o many nations, and to determine between force and virtue, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia addre&s;&s;ed his troops nearly in the following words.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;My dear friends, the hour is come, in which all that is, and all that ought to be dear to us, depends upon the &s;words which are now drawn for the battle. Time permits me to &s;ay but lit|tle; nor is there occa&s;ion to &s;ay much. You know that there is no labour, no hunger, no cold, no watching, no danger, that I have not &s;hared with you hither|to; and you now &s;ee me ready to lay down my life with you, and for you. All I a&s;k, is the &s;ame pledge of fidelity and af|fection that I give. And let me add, not as an incitement to your courage, but as a te&s;timony of my own gratitude, that from this hour, until you go into quarters, your pay &s;hall be dou|ble. Acquit your&s;elves like men, and put your confidence in God.&endq;</Q> The effect of this &s;peech was &s;uch as cannot be de&s;cribed. The general emotion bur&s;t in an univer&s;al &s;hout, and the looks and demeanor of the men were animat|ed to a &s;ort of heroic phren&s;y. In this di&s;po&s;ition, which progno&s;ti|cated the &s;ucce&s;s, the engagement began.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the action, the French cavalry came on with great &s;pirit, but they were repul&s;ed;
<PB N="23" REF="34">
&s;ome regiments having gained an e|minence defended them&s;elves brave|ly, but in the end they were to|tally routed. The infantry, both French and Imperiali&s;ts, made but a faint re&s;i&s;tance. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia in per&s;on expo&s;ed to the hotte&s;t fire, led on his troops; the enemy gave way in every part; they were &s;eized with a panic, and fled in the utmo&s;t di&s;order. They left 3000 men dead on the field of battle; 63 pieces of can|non, many colours. Eight French Generals, 250 officers of different ranks, and 6000 private men were taken. Night alone &s;aved from total de&s;truction the &s;cattered re|mains of an army that in the morn|ing was &s;o numerous and &s;o for|midable.</P>
<P>I have not undertaken on this, nor &s;hall I undertake upon any o|ther occa&s;ion, in the&s;e prelimina|ry chapters, to enter into the de|tail of all the various manoeuvres of every battle; they are matters little under&s;tood by, and little in|tere&s;ting to, the generality of rea|ders. Be&s;ides the accounts are &s;ome|times inaccurate, and &s;eldom or never con&s;i&s;tent with each other.</P>
<P>The glorious &s;ucce&s;s of the battle of Ro&s;bach, was &s;uch as hardly wanted to be improved; the enemy was left totally incapable of action. The King was &s;et free on that &s;ide; but it was a freedom which gave him no re&s;pite from his labours; it only gave him an opportunity of undergoing new labours in another part. The Au&s;trians had a va&s;t force, and had now begun to make a proportionable progre&s;s in Sile&s;ia. The dependence which the King had upon the fidelity of his Generals there, &s;eemed &s;haken by &s;omething which then appeared, and &s;till &s;eems ambiguous in their conduct. The Au&s;trians after a &s;iege from the 27th of October to the 11th of November, carried on under infinite difficulties and with a prodigious lo&s;s, had re|duced Schweidnitz, and obliged the Pru&s;&s;ian garri&s;on of 4000 men to &s;urrender pri&s;oners of war. Soon after, as they had intelligence of the victory of Ro&s;bach, and knew that the King of Pru&s;&s;ia was on full march to the relief of Sile&s;ia, the Au&s;trians re&s;olved to lo&s;e no time to attack the Prince of Bevern in his &s;trong camp under the walls of Bre&s;lau. A treble &s;uperiority incited them to this attempt. They attacked the Prince's army with great re&s;olution, and their attack was &s;u&s;|tained with amazing in|trepidity. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 22.</NOTE> The &s;laughter of the Au&s;|trians was prodigious. A great part of their army had retired from the field of battle, and the re&s;t were pre|paring to retire; when all at once the Pru&s;&s;ian Generals unexpectedly took the &s;ame re&s;olution. A part of their army had &s;uffered a great deal in the engagement. They became appre|hen&s;ive of a total defeat in ca&s;e their intrenchments &s;hould be forced in any part. With the&s;e ideas they retreat|ed from the &s;trong po&s;t they occu|pied, and retired behind the Oder. The Au&s;trians returning, with a&s;to|ni&s;hment &s;aw them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the field of battle, which they had but ju&s;t been obliged to relinqui&s;h. What is remarkable, and what gave ri&s;e to many conjectures, the Prince of Bevern going to reconnoitre with|out e&s;cort, and attended only by a groom, was taken two days after the battle by an advanced party of Croats, a &s;mall body of whom had cro&s;&s;ed the Oder.</P>
<P>This advantage, though dearly bought, was immediately followed with many others. Bre&s;lau the capital of Sile&s;ia imme|diately <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 24.</NOTE>
<PB N="24" REF="35">
&s;urrendered, where, as well as at Schweidnitz, they found va&s;t &s;tores of provi&s;ion, ammunition and money. All Sile&s;ia was on the point of falling into their hands. Fortune &s;eems every where to have thrown the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's affairs into di&s;|traction, in order to rai&s;e, and as it were to round his glory in e&s;tabli&s;h|ing them; and to have been even &s;o jealous of his honour as not to per|mit his own excellent generals and incomparable troops to triumph any where but in his own pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>The King immediately after the battle of Ro&s;bach, with tho&s;e troops which he had a few days before col|lected from places an hundred miles di&s;tant from each other, began a march of upwards of two hundred more, and led them from engaging one &s;uperior army, to engage ano|ther &s;till more &s;uperior; from dan|ger to hard&s;hip, and from hard&s;hip to renewed danger. In a mo&s;t ra|pid march he pa&s;&s;ed through Thu|ringia, through Mi&s;nia, through Lu&s;atia, in &s;pite of the efforts of the Generals Haddick and Mar&s;hal, who were po&s;ted in Lu&s;atia to ob|&s;truct him; and entering Sile&s;ia arrived the 2d of December at Parchwitz upon the Oder. Here he was joined by the Prince of Bevern's corps who cro&s;&s;ed that river to meet him.</P>
<P>About this time an incident hap|pened which was very remarkable; one of the&s;e agreeable adventures that relieve the mind amid&s;t the per|petual horror that attends a narra|tive of battles and blood&s;hed. The garri&s;on of Schweidnitz had &s;een, with the greate&s;t reluctance, the capitulation which bound their hands from the &s;ervice of their King and country. Whil&s;t the Au&s;trians were conducting them to pri&s;on, on their route they chanced to hear of the victory their ma&s;ter had gained at Ro&s;bach; animated with this news, they unanimou&s;ly ro&s;e upon the e&s;cort which conducted them, and which happened not to be very &s;trong, and entirely di&s;per&s;ed it. Thus freed, they marched on not very certain of their way, in hope to rejoin &s;ome corps of the Pru&s;&s;ian troops. The &s;ame fortune which freed them, led them directly to the army commanded by the King him|&s;elf, which was ha&s;tening to their relief. Great was the joy on both &s;ides at this unexpected meeting, for the pri&s;oners had heard nothing of his maje&s;ty's march. This little in|cident, whil&s;t it added a con&s;iderable &s;trength to the army, added like|wi&s;e to its &s;pirit, and &s;eemed an hap|py omen of &s;ucce&s;s in the future engagement.</P>
<P>As his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty approach|ed to Bre&s;lau, the Au&s;trians con|&s;iding in their &s;uperiority, abandon|ed their &s;trong camp (the &s;ame which had been, occupied by the Prince of Bevern) and re&s;olved to give the King battle. He was marching with the utmo&s;t diligence <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 5.</NOTE> not to di&s;appoint them; and they met near the village of Leuthen. The ground which the Au&s;trians occupied was very advantageous, and every advantage of the &s;itu|ation was improved to the utmo&s;t, by the diligence and &s;kill of Count Daun; who remembering that he was the only General who had ever carried the field from the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, knew better than any body how difficult it was to ob|tain &s;uch a victory. All the di&s;|po&s;itions were made accordingly; the ground they occupied was a plain, except that in &s;ome parts it had &s;mall eminences; the&s;e they &s;ur|rounded with artillery; the ground was al&s;o inter&s;per&s;ed with thickets,
<PB N="25" REF="36">
which they &s;ought to turn to their advantage. On their right and left were hills on which they planted batteries of cannon. The ground in their front was inter&s;ected by many cau&s;eways; and to make the whole more impracticable, the Au&s;trians had felled a va&s;t many trees, and &s;cattered them in the way. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia was not terrified with this &s;ituation, nor with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that above 70,000 excellent troops, commanded by Count Daun, were &s;o po&s;ted. The Pru&s;&s;ians, who did not exceed, as it is &s;aid, 36,000 men, attacked them with their u&s;ual re&s;olution. It was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible, at the beginning of the engagement, for the Pru&s;&s;ian hor&s;e to act, on account of the im|pediments we have ju&s;t mentioned, but a mo&s;t judicious di&s;po&s;ition of the King him&s;elf overcame that di&s;|advantage; he had in his fir&s;t di&s;|po&s;itions placed four battalions be|hind the cavalry of his right wing, fore&s;eeing that General Nada&s;ti, who was placed with a corps de re&s;erve on the enemy's left, de&s;igned to take him in flank. It happened as he had fore&s;een; that General's hor&s;e attacked the King's right wing with great fury; but he was received with &s;o &s;evere a fire from the four battali|ons, that he was obliged to retire in di&s;order. Then the Kings flank well covered and &s;upported was enabled to act with &s;uch order and vigour, that the enemy's right was obliged to give way. The Pru&s;&s;ian artillery, which was incomparably &s;erved, and &s;ilenced that of the enemy, con|curred to maintain the King's in|fantry, and to enable them to act in grounds where their hor&s;e could give them but little a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The Au&s;trians made a gallant re&s;i&s;tance during the whole battle. The panic of the enemy did nor here, as at Ro&s;|bach, do half the bu&s;ine&s;s; every foot of ground was well di&s;puted. The Au&s;trians rallied all their forces about Leuthen, which was defended upon all &s;ides with intrenchments and redoubts. After reiterated attacks made with the utmo&s;t impetuo&s;ity, and &s;u&s;tained with great firmne&s;s, the Pru&s;&s;ians ma&s;tered the po&s;t; then the Au&s;trians fled on all parts; they were entirely routed. The King pur&s;ued them to Li&s;&s;a. 6000 of the Au&s;trians were &s;lain, 15,000 were made pri|&s;oners; and an immen&s;e artillery, up|wards of 200 pieces of cannon, were taken.</P>
<P>This great and deci&s;ive action was fought on the very &s;ame day of the the next month after the no le&s;s im|portant and deci&s;ive battle of Ro&s;|bach. The con&s;equences that fol|lowed the action of Leuthen, declar|ed the entirene&s;s of the victory. Notwith&s;tanding the rigour of the &s;ea&s;on, the &s;iege of Bre&s;lau was im|mediately undertaken, and pro&s;e|cuted with &s;uch &s;pirit, that by the 29th of December it &s;urrendered; and with it &s;urrendered the garri&s;on of 13,000 men pri&s;oners of war; the blockade of Schweidnitz was formed as clo&s;ely as the inclemency of the winter would permit; whil&s;t the Pru&s;&s;ian parties not only repo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed tho&s;e parts of Sile&s;ia which belonged to the King, but penetrating into the Au&s;trian divi&s;ion, reduced Ja|gerndorf, Troppau, and Tet&s;chen, and left to the Empre&s;s Queen, ex|cept a forlorn garri&s;on in Schweid|nitz, no &s;ort of footing in that country, in which a few days before &s;he reckoned her dominion perfectly e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>

<P>AS the misfortunes of his Pru&s;|&s;ian Maje&s;ty, after the battle of Colin, came on him all at once, &s;o his &s;ucce&s;&s;es, after his victories at Ro&s;bach and Li&s;&s;a, flowed upon him all at once likewi&s;e, and in a full tide. The Ru&s;&s;ians, though they had repul&s;ed General Lehwald, &s;uf|fered &s;o much in that action, and their barbarous method of making war had &s;o de&s;troyed the country, that they &s;eemed to them&s;elves to have no way of &s;afety left but in re|tiring out of the Pru&s;&s;ian territories. This extraordinary retreat of &s;o great an army, and &s;o lately victori|ous, and &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a good &s;ea|port in the country, could &s;carcely be accounted for on tho&s;e motives we have a&s;&s;igned, and a&s;toni&s;hed all Eu|rope, whil&s;t it left Gen. Lehwald at liberty to turn his arms into Pome|rania again&s;t the Swedes. The Swedes on this occa&s;ion did nothing worthy of their ancient military &s;ame; but every where retiring, left the Pru&s;&s;ians an ea&s;y conque&s;t, not only of the Pru&s;&s;ian but of eve|ry part of the Swedi&s;h Pomerania, excepting the port of Stral&s;und; they left their allies of Mecklenbourg quite expo&s;ed to all the re&s;entment of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, who cha&s;ti&s;ed them with the mo&s;t &s;evere contri|butions and levies. The French, who had been ravaging the old marche of Brandenburg, evacuated that country immediately after the battle of Ro&s;bach. But one of the greate&s;t revolutions of fortune in the war, and one of the mo&s;t glori|ous and important con&s;equences of that victory, was, that the Hanove|rian troops were enabled to re&s;ume their arms.</P>
<P>From the moment the capitula|tion of Clo&s;ter-&s;even was &s;igned, the Duke de Richlieu, who came to the command only to reap the ad|vantage, and fully the honour of an|other's conque&s;t, &s;eemed to think of nothing but how to repair, from the plunder of the unhappy Ha|noverians, the fortune which he had &s;hattered by a thou&s;and vices. The mo&s;t exorbitant contributions were levied with the mo&s;t inflexible &s;e|verity; every exaction, which was &s;ubmitted to, only produced a new one &s;till more extravagant; and all the orderly methods of plunder did not exempt them from the pillage, licentiou&s;ne&s;s, and in&s;olence of the French &s;oldiery. However, in ju|&s;tice to merit, we mu&s;t except from this general charge the conduct of the Duke de Randan, Governor of Hanover for the French; who &s;aved the capital of the electorate from utter ruin by the &s;trictne&s;s of all his di&s;cipline, by the prudence, the ju|&s;tice and moderation of all his con|duct; a conduct which does more real honour to his name, than the mo&s;t &s;plendid victories.</P>
<P>The Duke de Richlieu's rapaci|ou&s;ne&s;s and oppre&s;&s;ion, whil&s;t they leaned &s;o heavily on the conquered people, did the conquering army no kind of &s;ervice. Intent only on plunder, which he did not confine to the enemy, he relaxed every part of military di&s;cipline; and that numerous army which M. d' Etrees

had &s;u&s;tained, and brought in health and &s;pirits through the di&s;mal de|&s;arts of We&s;tphalia, under all the oppo&s;ition of a &s;kilful adver&s;ary, were now, in full peace, in the quiet po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of a conquered and plentiful country, reduced in their numbers, decayed in their health and their &s;pirits, without cloaths, without &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, without order, without arms. In this condition they began at la&s;t to perceive that the Hanove|rians, with the yoke of the capitula|tion about their necks, were &s;till formidable. As they had broke almo&s;t every article of that treaty, they made no &s;cruple to add another breach in order to &s;ecure them in all the re&s;t. They attempted ac|tually to take their arms from the Hanoverian and He&s;&s;ian troops. The&s;e gallant troops, who had with a &s;ilent grief and indignation &s;een the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of their ruined country, were ravi&s;hed to find that the vic|tory at Ro&s;bach encouraged their &s;overeign to re&s;ent at la&s;t this and all the other indignities they had &s;uf|fered. They began to collect and to act, and under the command of the gallant Prince Ferdinand of Brun&s;wick, reinforced with a body of Pru&s;&s;ian troops, they broke from their confinement. They reduced the town of Harburg, and laid clo&s;e &s;iege to the ca&s;tle, which it mu&s;t be owned was defended very brave|ly. In all other re&s;pects the French did not &s;eem in a condition to main|tain their ground any where. Tho&s;e troops, which a few months before had &s;o &s;ubmitted as to make it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to declare that they were <HI>not pri&s;oners of war</HI> in order to explain their condition, were now on the point of pu&s;hing their adver&s;aries to almo&s;t the &s;ame &s;treights. Such was the force of French military di&s;|cipline, and &s;uch the triumphs of Voltaire's hero.</P>
<P>The King of Pru&s;&s;ia now &s;aw the full effect of his coun&s;els and his labours. His dominions were freed; his allies were enabled to a&s;&s;i&s;t him; and his enemies defeated, broken, and flying every where before him. In what light po&s;terity will view the&s;e things is uncertain; we, under who&s;e eyes, as we may &s;ay, they were atchieved, &s;carcely believed what we had &s;een. And perhaps in all the records of time, the compa&s;s of a &s;ingle year, on the &s;cene of a &s;ingle country, never contained &s;o many &s;triking events, never di&s;play|ed &s;o many revolutions of fortune; revolutions not only beyond what might have been expected, but far beyond what the mo&s;t &s;agacious fore&s;ight, rea&s;oning from experience, and the nature of things, could po&s;|&s;ibly have imagined. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia at fir&s;t triumphant: the whole power of the Au&s;trians to|tally defeated; their hopes utterly ruined: then their affairs &s;uddenly re|e&s;tabli&s;hed, their armies victori|ous, and the King of Pru&s;&s;ia in his turn hurled down; defeated; aban|doned by his allies; &s;urrounded by his enemies; on the very edge of de&s;pair: then all at once rai&s;ed be|yond all hope, he &s;ees the united Au&s;train, Imperial, and French power levelled with the ground. 40,000 Hanoverians, a whole army, &s;ubmit to 80,000 French, and are only <HI>not</HI> pri&s;oners of war. The French are peaceable ma&s;ters of all the country between the We&s;er and the Elbe: anon, the&s;e &s;ubdued Hanoverians re&s;ume their arms; they recover their country, and the French in a little time think them|&s;elves not &s;ecure to the ea&s;tward of the Rhine. 500,000 men in action. Six pitched battles fought. Three great armies annihilated. The French army reduced and vanqui&s;h|ed

<P>WITH regard to the part we had in the tran&s;actions of this year, though it was not &s;o full of &s;triking events, nor does it af|ford &s;uch a &s;plendid &s;ubject for nar|rative, yet it is as intere&s;ting to an Engli&s;h reader, and may perhaps prove more in&s;tructive; as it &s;hews us in &s;o &s;trong a light, the mi&s;erable con&s;equences of our political divi&s;i|ons, which produced a general un|&s;teadine&s;s in all our pur&s;uits, and infu&s;ed a languor and inactivity into all our military operations. For, whil&s;t our commanders abroad knew not who were to reward their &s;ervices or puni&s;h their neglects, and were not a&s;&s;ured in what light even the be&s;t of their actions would be con|&s;idered, (having rea&s;on to apprehend that they might not be judged of as they were in them&s;elves, but as their appearances might an&s;wer the end of &s;ome ruling faction;) they naturally wanted that firm|ne&s;s and that enterprizing re|&s;olution, without which the be&s;t ca|pacity, and intentions the mo&s;t hone&s;t, can do nothing in war. The attachment of mo&s;t men to their parties, weakened their affection to their country. It has been imagined that mini&s;ters did not always wi&s;h &s;ucce&s;s even to their own &s;chemes, le&s;t obnoxious men &s;hould acquire credit by the execution of them; as it was &s;u&s;pected that officers even at the expence of their own reputation, did not exert their faculties to the ut|mo&s;t, le&s;t a di&s;agreeable mini&s;terial &s;y&s;tem &s;hould e&s;tabli&s;h the credit of its coun&s;els by the vigour of their operations. For my own part, I think that the&s;e refinements, in which there is often as much malice di&s;|covered as penetration, have car|ried the matter infinitely too far. But certain it is, that the &s;pirit of per&s;onal parties and attachments, never carried to greater lengths than at that time, proved of very bad con&s;equence, if it had no other ef|fect than to rai&s;e and to give a colour to &s;uch &s;u&s;picions as we have ju&s;t mentioned. Whatever was the cau&s;e, it is mo&s;t certain, that our &s;ucce&s;s in America this year, no more an&s;wered to the greatne&s;s of our preparations and our hopes than it did in the two preceding.</P>
<P>The attack upon Crown Point, which had been a principal object of our attention in the beginning, &s;eemed at this time to be laid a&s;ide; and an expedition to Loui&s;bourg, un|doubtedly a more con&s;iderable ob|ject in it&s;elf, &s;upplied its place. Lord Loudon was to command the
<PB N="29" REF="41">
land forces in this expedition; Ad|miral Holborn the navy. The for|mer left New York with a body of 6000 men, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 9.</NOTE> &s;ailed to Halifax, where he was joined by the latter, who had &s;ailed from Corke on the 7th of May with a con&s;iderable fleet, and much the &s;ame number of land forces, which his lord&s;hip had brought from New York. When the united armies and fleets were on the point of departing for Loui&s;bourg, news arrived at Halifax, that the Bre&s;t fleet con&s;i&s;t|ing of &s;eventeen &s;hips of the line be|&s;ides frigates, with great &s;upplies of military &s;tores, provi&s;ions, and men, were arrived at the harbour which they were preparing to attack. This news immediately &s;u&s;pended their preparations Councils of war were held one after another. The re&s;ult of the whole was, that as the place was &s;o well reinforced, the fleet of the French rather &s;uperior to our navy, and the &s;ea&s;on &s;o far advan|ced, it was the more prudent cour&s;e to defer the enterpri&s;e to a more favourable opportunity. This re&s;olution &s;eems to have been the mo&s;t eligible in their circum&s;tances, becau&s;e the council of war was al|mo&s;t unanimous in it.</P>
<P>Lord London returned to New-York, and the Admiral now freed from the care of the tran&s;ports &s;et &s;ail for Loui&s;bourg, in hopes as it was &s;aid, of drawing the French fleet to an engagement. But upon what grounds this hope was conceived, I confe&s;s I cannot &s;ee; as it could not be imagined, that the French fleet having no &s;ort of occa&s;ion to fight in order to protect Loui&s;bourg, would chu&s;e out of a bravado to bring on an unnece&s;&s;ary battle. However it was, the Engli&s;h &s;quadron continued to cruize off that harbour until the 25th of September, when they were overtaken by a terrible &s;torm, in which one of our &s;hips was lo&s;t, eleven di&s;ma&s;ted, and the re&s;t re|turned to England in a very &s;hat|tered condition. This was the end of the expedition to Loui&s;bourg from which &s;o much was expected. But it was not the wor&s;t con&s;equence which attended it.</P>
<P>Since O&s;wego had been taken, the French remained entirely ma&s;ters of all the lakes, and we could do nothing to ob&s;truct their collecting the Indians from all parts, and ob|liging them to act in their favour. But our apprehen&s;ions, (or what &s;hall they be called?) did more in favour of the French than their con|que&s;ts. Not &s;atisfied with the lo&s;s of that important fortre&s;s, we our|&s;elves abandoned to the mercy of the enemy all the country of the Five Nations, the only body of Indians who pre&s;erved even the ap|pearance of friend&s;hip to us. The forts we had at the Great carrying Place were demoli&s;hed; Wood Creek was indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;topped up and filled with logs; by which it became evident to all tho&s;e who knew that country, that our com|munication with our allied Indians was totally cut off; and what was wor&s;e, our whole frontier left per|fectly uncovered to the irruption of the enemies &s;avages, who &s;oon a|vailed them&s;elves of our errors. For after the removal of the&s;e barriers, and the taking of fort William-Henry, of which we &s;hall &s;peak pre&s;ently, they de&s;troyed with fire and &s;word the fine &s;ettlements which we po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed on the Mohawks river and on tho&s;e grounds called the German flats. Thus with a va&s;t increa&s;e of our forces, and the cleare&s;t &s;uperi|ority over the enemy, we only a|bandoned our allies, expo&s;ed our people, and relinqui&s;hed a large and valuable tract of country. The
<PB N="30" REF="42">
French &s;oon made us feel effectually the want of what we had lo&s;t, and what we had thrown away.</P>
<P>A con&s;iderable fort called Fort William-Henry, had been built on the &s;outhern edge of the Lake George, in order to command that lake, and to cover our frontiers; a garri&s;on of 2500 men defended it. General Webb with about 4000 men was po&s;ted at no great di&s;tance. No &s;ooner had the French learned that my Lord Loudon with the body of the army was gone on the Loui&s;|bourg expedition, than they pre|pared to take advantage of his ab|&s;ence. They drew together all the forces which they had at Crown-Point, Ticonderoga, and the adja|cent po&s;ts; they added a con&s;ider|able body of Canadians, and a greater number of Indians than they had ever yet employed; the whole made near 8000 men. With the&s;e and a very good artillery, Mon&s;ieur Montcalm prepared to be|&s;iege Fort William-Henry. It is &s;aid that the advances of this commander were not made with &s;o much &s;ecrecy as to prevent General Webb from having early intelligence of his mo|tions; but unfortunately no credit being given to this intelligence, or|ders were not &s;ent to collect the militia in &s;ufficient time, which in conjunction with his own forces, and with tho&s;e in the fort, had either obliged the French to relinqui&s;h their attempt, or to have made it a very great hazard. But the &s;iege being now regularly formed, and the be&s;iegers meeting but lit|tle <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 3.</NOTE> oppo&s;ition from within, and no di&s;turbance at all from with|out, the place was in &s;ix <NOTE PLACE="marg">9th.</NOTE> days &s;urrendered by the advice of General Webb; who&s;e intercepted letter M. Montcalm &s;ent into the fort.</P>
<P>The garri&s;on marched out with their arms, and engaged not to &s;erve during eighteen months. The French &s;avages paid no regard to the capi|tulation, but falling upon our men as they marched out, dragged away the little effects they had left, hawl|ing the Indians and Blacks in our &s;ervice out of their ranks, &s;calping &s;ome, carrying off others, and com|mitting a thou&s;and outrages and barbarities, from which the French commander endeavoured in vain to re&s;train them. All this was &s;uffered by 2000 men with arms in their hands, from a di&s;orderly crew of &s;avages. However the greate&s;t part of our men, though in a bad condition, got to Fort Edward, &s;ome by flight; &s;ome having &s;urrendered them&s;elves to the French, were by them &s;ent home &s;afe. The enemy demoli&s;hed the fort, carried off the provi&s;ion, ammunition, artillery, and the ve&s;&s;els which we had prepared on the lake, and departed with|out attempting any thing further. Neither was any thing further at|tempted on our &s;ide. And thus was fini&s;hed the third campaign in North-America, where we had actually near 20,000 regular troops, a great number of provincial forces, and a great naval power of upwards of twenty &s;hips of the line.</P>
<P>A war between the maritime powers is felt in all parts of the world. Not content with inflam|ing Europe and America, the di&s;&s;en|tions of the French and Engli&s;h pur&s;ued the tracks of their com|merce, and the Ganges felt the fa|tal effects of a quarrel on the Ohio. But here the &s;cene is changed great|ly to the advantage of our nation; the bravery of Admiral Wat&s;on and Colonel Clive, re-e&s;tabli&s;hed the military honour of the Engli&s;h, which was &s;inking there as it had done in all other places. Admiral Wat&s;on

Ani|mated with revenge at the affecting &s;ight of this place, our &s;hips and land forces attacked it with &s;o much &s;pirit, that the Indians &s;urrendered it on the &s;ame day it was approach|ed. A few days after Hugly, &s;itu|ated higher up on the Ganges, was reduced with as little difficulty.</P>
<P>The Nabob, who &s;aw that the tor|rent of the Engli&s;h valour could not be re&s;i&s;ted by &s;uch feeble dams as forts defended by Indians, drew down a whole army con&s;i&s;ting of 10,000 hor&s;e, and 12,000 foot, to drive them from their conque&s;ts. In|finitely inferior as our troops were in number, they did not he|&s;itate to attack the Nabob's <NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 5.</NOTE> army. Though our forces did not entirely rout the Indians, yet they made a great &s;laughter among&s;t them; and they had &s;o much the advantage of the field, that the Nabob was in a &s;hort time <NOTE PLACE="marg">9th.</NOTE> glad to conclude a treaty of peace, by which the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-India company was re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in all its antient privileges; an immunity from all taxes was granted, and a re&s;titution promi&s;ed for all that the trade had &s;uffered in the taking of Calcutta.</P>
<P>When all ob&s;truction on the &s;ide of the Indians was removed, and the company's officers had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their antient e&s;tabli&s;h|ments, the Admiral turned his arms again&s;t the French. He re&s;olved to attack Chandenagore, &s;ituated &s;ome|what higher on the river than Cal|cutta; a place of con&s;iderable &s;trength and the principal &s;ettlement of the French in that part of the Ea&s;t-Indies. In this expedition Colonel Clive commanded 700 Europeans and 1600 Black &s;oldiers. The Admirals Wat&s;on and Pocock commanded the fleet, if it may be called a fleet which con&s;i&s;ted of no more than three &s;hips of the line, the Kent, the Tyger, and the Sali&s;|bury. The French prepared in the be&s;t manner they could to receive them, and &s;unk &s;everal large ve&s;&s;els both above and below their fort; but the Admiral having by carefully &s;ounding found a &s;afe pa&s;&s;age with|out being driven to the nece&s;&s;ity of weighing up any of the &s;hips, made &s;o &s;evere a fire upon the fort, in which he was &s;econded by Colonel Clive's batteries on the &s;hore, that the place capitulated in <NOTE PLACE="marg">May 24.</NOTE> le&s;s than three hours. 500 Europe|ans and 700 Blacks &s;urrendered pri|&s;oners of war; 183 pieces of cannon were found in the place, be&s;ides a con&s;iderable value in goods and money. Four forts co&s;t our troops no more than four days to reduce them.</P>
<P>The judicious timeing of the&s;e &s;everal operations, as well as tho&s;e which followed, was not le&s;s laud|able than the gallant &s;pirit with which they were executed. Before the French were alarmed, care was taken to repo&s;&s;e&s;s all the po&s;ts we formerly held; to humble the Na|bob by &s;ome effectual blow; and by a treaty to tie up his hands from act|ing

again&s;t us. This Prince had &s;hewed him&s;elf from the moment of his &s;igning that treaty, very little inclined to abide by the &s;tipulations he had made. He indeed promi&s;ed abundantly, but always deferred the performance upon &s;uch frivolous pretences, as evidently demon&s;trated his ill intentions. The Engli&s;h commanders under&s;tood this pro|ceeding perfectly well; but they re&s;olved to di&s;&s;emble their &s;en&s;e of it, until they had broken the French power in this province, which they had greater rea&s;on to dread, &s;mall as it was, than all the armies of the Nabob. When they had fully accompli&s;hed this by the taking of Chandenagore, they deli|berated whether they ought not to recommence ho&s;tilities with the In|dians. A re&s;olution in the affirma|tive had been attended with great difficulty and danger, if a mo&s;t for|tunate incident had not helped to en|&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The Nabob Suraja Doula, the &s;ame who had the la&s;t year taken Calcutta, had &s;hewn to his own &s;ub|jects the &s;ame violent and perfidious &s;pirit, which formerly and &s;till di&s;tre&s;|&s;ed the Engli&s;h. His Generals were mo&s;tly di&s;contented, and &s;ome of them entered into a con&s;piracy again&s;t him. Jaffier Ali Cawn one of his principal officers, a man of great power and intere&s;t, was at the head of this con&s;piracy. As &s;oon as their de&s;igns were ripened, they communicated them to the Engli&s;h government in Calcutta, praying their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The chiefs there did not he&s;itate long what party they &s;hould take; they entered into a treaty with Jaffier Ali Cawn and the con&s;pirators; and in con&s;equence of this treaty, our troops immediately took the field under Colonel Clive. The Ad|miral undertook to garri&s;on the fort of Chandenagore with his &s;eamen, in order to leave the greater number of land forces for the expedition. A detachment of fifty &s;eamen with their officers were added to &s;erve as gunners. A twenty gun &s;hip was &s;tationed above Hugly, in order to pre&s;erve a com|munication between Colonel Clive and the Admiral.</P>
<P>Their preliminary mea&s;ures being thus judiciou&s;ly taken, they advanced up the river, and in a few days brought the Nabob's army of about 20,000 men, exclu&s;ive of tho&s;e who favoured the con&s;pirators, to an ac|tion, which was deci&s;ive in favour of the Engli&s;h. Two <NOTE PLACE="marg">June 22.</NOTE> con&s;iderable bodies commanded by Jaffier and Roy Dolub remained inactive in the engagement. The Nabob &s;eeing him&s;elf ruined by the treachery of his officers and the cowardice of his troops, fled with the few who continued faithful to him.</P>
<P>Jaffier Ali Cawn now de|clared him&s;elf openly; and <NOTE PLACE="marg">26.</NOTE> entering Muxadavat the capital of the province with an army of his friends and victorious allies, he was placed by Colonel Clive in the antient &s;eat of the Nabobs, and received the homage of all ranks of people as Suba of Bengal, Bahar and Orixa. The depo&s;ed Nabob was &s;oon after made pri&s;oner, and put to death in his pri&s;on by the conqueror. In about thirteen days this great revolution was accompli&s;hed; and with le&s;s force and trouble than often is required to take a petty village in Germany, was transferred the government of a va&s;t kingdom, yielding in its di|men&s;ions to few in Europe, but to none in the fertility of its &s;oil, the number of its inhabitants, and the richne&s;s of its commerce. By the alliance with the new Nabob, and by the reduction of Chandenagore, the French were entirely driven out
<PB N="33" REF="45">
of Bengal and all its dependencies. This was one of the articles of the treaty. By the other articles, a perpetual alliance offen&s;ive and de|fen&s;ive was made between the par|ties. The territories of the com|pany were enlarged, and upwards of two millions &s;terling was &s;tipu|lated to be paid as an indemnifica|tion to the Ea&s;t-India company, and the &s;ufferers in the taking of Cal|cutta. The new Nabob full of gratitude to tho&s;e to whom he owed his dignity, gave, be&s;ides the above large &s;ums, about 600, 000 pounds, as a gratuity to the &s;ea &s;quadron and the troops. However &s;hort of ex|pectation our enterpri&s;es in America fell this year, tho&s;e in the Ea&s;t-In|dies greatly exceeded every thing we could hope from the forces which were employed. And it may be doubted whether all the great powers engaged in the pre&s;ent bloody wars in Europe, in which &s;uch torrents of blood are &s;pilled, and &s;o many millions of trea&s;ure are wa&s;ted, will in the conclu&s;ion reap among&s;t them &s;o much &s;olid profit as the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-India company did with a handful of men in a &s;hort campaign. The joy of the nation at the&s;e &s;ignal &s;ucce&s;&s;es, was not a little damped by the death of Admiral Wat&s;on, who lo&s;t his life by the unwhole|&s;omene&s;s <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 16.</NOTE> of the country, in which he had e&s;tabli&s;hed a great and la&s;t|ing reputation.

<P>ALL the blood&s;hed of the la&s;t campaign in <NOTE PLACE="marg">1758.</NOTE> Germany, and tho&s;e lo&s;&s;es which both the victorious and vanqui&s;hed felt &s;o very &s;everely, produced no overtures towards peace from any of the powers at war. And perhaps nothing &s;o &s;ingular ever happened, as that &s;o many &s;tates, united, if not again&s;t their real intere&s;ts, yet a|gain&s;t all their former habits of con|nection, full of &s;o many occa&s;ions of jealou&s;y, abounding with matter of complaint again&s;t each other, and even involved in misfortunes which u&s;ually de&s;troy a mutual confidence, that not one of the&s;e powers either from fear, or hope, or wearine&s;s, or levity, de&s;i&s;ted from their ho&s;tilities again&s;t the King of Pru&s;&s;ia; nor did that monarch acquire one ally more by the admiration of his &s;ucce&s;&s;es, than he had formerly gained thro' compa&s;&s;ion to his misfortunes. All the confederates pre&s;erved the &s;ame attachment to each other, to him the &s;ame animo&s;ity. It is equally a mat|ter of great admiration, how the re&s;ources even of the&s;e great &s;tates, could keep pace with their ambition, and in a very few months &s;upply the place of great armies almo&s;t wholly de&s;troyed. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia by his victories had added to his natu|ral re&s;ources. The&s;e re&s;ources were more con&s;iderable than is commonly imagined; and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Saxony which yielded him great &s;upplies, &s;aved his own revenue. He was indeed not quite &s;o fre&s;h as at the beginning of the war; but then the condition of the enemy was

in many re&s;pects far wor&s;e that his. His troops had be&s;ides acquired a high reputation and a clear &s;upe|riority over all others. The con|&s;ideration, however, of an army greatly hara&s;&s;ed, and a mo&s;t &s;evere winter obliged him to re&s;train his ardor, and to attempt nothing a|gain&s;t the Au&s;trians in the months of January, February, and March. The &s;ame inaction owing to much the &s;ame cau&s;es, prevailed among&s;t the Hanoverians for a little time: but having been reinforced about the middle of February by a body of Pru&s;&s;ian hor&s;e, they put their whole army once more in motion.</P>
<P>The Duke de Richlieu had been recalled, and the Count of Clermont now commanded the French troops. This was their third commander in chief within the &s;pace of a year; a circum&s;tance alone &s;ufficient to &s;hew the un&s;teadine&s;s of their councils, and the irregularity of their o|perations. In effect, they every where retreated before the Hanove|rians, who&s;e main body marched on the right to the country of Bremen; whil&s;t a &s;econd body under General Za&s;trow kept on the left towards Gif|forn. They pu&s;hed the French from po&s;t to po&s;t. They obliged them to evacuate Otter&s;berg, Bremen, and Werden. The ca&s;tle of Rotter&s;|berg was taken in &s;ix hours. A con|&s;iderable detachment under Count Chabot was po&s;ted at Hoya, a &s;trong fort upon the We&s;er, and a place of &s;uch con&s;equence that Prince Ferdinand re&s;olved to di&s;lodge the enemy from it. He appointed for that &s;ervice the hereditary Prince of Brun&s;wick, with four battalions of foot and &s;ome light hor&s;e. This Prince, not twenty years of age, had already entered into the cour&s;e of glory under the au&s;pices of his uncle, and full of ardor to &s;ignalize him&s;elf, with joy embraced the occa&s;ion: and here he gave an earne&s;t of his fame, in one of the mo&s;t lively and be&s;t conducted actions in the war. The fir&s;t fruits of this young hero were &s;uch as would have done honour to the maturity of the mo&s;t expe|rienced &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>The Prince had a broad and deep river to pa&s;s. He had no means of tran&s;porting his <NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 23.</NOTE> men, but a &s;ingle float; &s;o that a long time mu&s;t be &s;pent in getting them over: what was wor&s;t, be|fore half his troops were pa&s;&s;ed, a &s;trong wind aro&s;e, which rendered the float un&s;erviceable, and entire|ly cut off all communication be|tween the Prince and the mo&s;t con&s;iderable number of his party, whil&s;t the party he was going to attack was &s;uperior to him, had his whole body been together. In this exigence the Prince came to a re&s;olution worthy of him&s;elf. He re&s;olved not to &s;pend any time in attempts to bring over the re&s;t of his troops, much le&s;s to make any attempt to return to them; but to urge on boldly, in &s;uch a manner as to po&s;&s;e&s;s the enemy with an opinion of his &s;trength, and to at|tack them bri&s;kly before they could be undeceived. Therefore, between 4 and 5 o'clock in the morning, they marched with the utmo&s;t &s;peed di|rectly to the Town of Hoya. When they were approached within a mile and an half of the place, another accident was on the point of de|feating the whole enterpri&s;e. Their detachment fired by mi&s;take upon four of the enemies dragoons, who were patrolling; the firing was caught from one to another, and at la&s;t became general. This &s;eemed more than enough to di&s;cover their motions and alarm the enemy. But the &s;ame &s;pirit influenced the con|duct
<PB N="35" REF="47">
of every part of this affair; a bold countenance became nece&s;&s;ary, and it was a&s;&s;umed; they marched with the utmo&s;t diligence to the town, and encountered the enemy at the bridge; a fierce fire, well &s;upported on either &s;ide, en&s;ued. The ground was &s;uch, that the Prince could not bring up his whole detachment equally. Sen&s;ible of this di&s;advantage, he formed a de&s;ign to overcome it, as judicious as it was re|&s;olute, which was to turn the enemy by attacking them in the rear; to ex|ecute this de&s;ign, it was nece&s;&s;ary to make a circuit about the twon. Eve|ry thing &s;ucceeded: the attack on the enemy's rear was made with bayonets fixed; a terrible &s;laughter en&s;ued. The French abandoned the bridge, and fled in confu&s;ion: The Prince having cleared the town of the ene|my, joined the party he had left. The Count de Chabot threw him|&s;elf, with two battalions, into the ca&s;tle, with a re&s;olution to maintain him&s;elf there; but, in a little time, he capitulated, &s;urrendering the place, his &s;tores, and magazines, his troops being permitted to march out. The Prince, who had no artillery, and who, on account of the bad|ne&s;s of the roads, de&s;paired of bring|ing up heavy cannon, &s;uffered them to depart. Six hundred and &s;even|ty men were made pri&s;oners in the action, and a place of much impor|tance, and which opened a pa&s;&s;age over the We&s;er, &s;ecured to the Ha|noverians, with the lo&s;s of le&s;s than 100 men killed and wounded. I have dwelt on this action, and de&s;cribed it as particularly as I could, though nothing deci&s;ive in it&s;elf, becau&s;e it is not in pitched battles between great armies, where the mo&s;t mo&s;terly &s;trokes of conduct are always di&s;|played; the&s;e le&s;&s;er affairs frequent|ly call for as much or more of &s;aga|city, re&s;olution, and pre&s;ence of mind, in the commander; yet are they often &s;lightly pa&s;&s;ed by, as mat|ters of no con&s;equence, by the ge|nerality of people, who rather con|&s;ider the greatne&s;s of the event, than the &s;pirit of the action.</P>
<P>Prince Ferdinand continued to advance, with his right on one &s;ide of the We&s;er, and his left on the other; the French continued to re|tire, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ively abandoned all the places they had occupied in the electorate, except Minden. A gar|ri&s;on of 4000 men defended that place; but it was clo&s;ely inve&s;ted, and in nine days the whole garri&s;on &s;urrendered pri&s;o|ners <NOTE PLACE="marg">March 14.</NOTE> of war. Several &s;kir|mi&s;hes happened between the ad|vanced parties of the Hanoverian army and the French, always to the advantage of the former. The wretched condition of the French troops is hardly to be de&s;cribed or imagined: officers and &s;oldiers in|volved in one common di&s;tre&s;s; the officers forgot their rank, and the &s;oldiers their obedience; full ho&s;pitals, and empty magazines; a rigorous &s;ea&s;on, and bad covering; their baggage &s;eized or abandoned, and the hu&s;&s;ars and hunters of the allied army continually hara&s;&s;ing, pillaging, and cutting them off. It was no alleviation to their mi&s;e|ry, that the inhabitants of the country, which they abandoned, were reduced to the &s;ame extremi|ties. The &s;avage behaviour of &s;ome of their corps at their depar|ture, took away all compa&s;&s;ion for their &s;ufferings: but this was not univer&s;al. The Duke de Randan, who commanded in Hanover, quit|ted the place with the &s;ame virtue, that he had &s;o long held it. Re|&s;entment had no more power to per&s;uade him to act with rigour, in
<PB N="36" REF="48">
the adver&s;e turn of the French af|fairs, than the pride of conque&s;t had in their pro&s;perity. When he had orders to evacuate the place, there were very con&s;iderable magazines of corn and forage, ama&s;&s;ed for the u&s;e of the army; he had full time to burn them, and he had prece|dents enough to have ju&s;tified the action; but he left the whole in the hands of the magi&s;trates, to be gra|tuitou&s;ly di&s;tributed to the poor: he employed all his vigilance to prevent the lea&s;t di&s;order among&s;t his troops, and was him&s;elf the la&s;t man that marched out of the town. This be|haviour, which did &s;uch honour to his name and country, has made his memory for ever dear to the Hano|verians, drew tears of love and gra|titude from his enemies, and acknow|ledgements from the generous Prince again&s;t whom he &s;erved.</P>
<P>The French, through extreme dif|ficulties, marched towards the Rhine in three columns. The &s;everal &s;cat|tered bodies, which had united at Mun&s;ter, formed the right. The body which came from Paderborn, and which was commanded by the Prince of Clermont in per&s;on, march|ed in the middle. The forces which had occupied He&s;&s;e were on the left. In this order they reached the Rhine, which they all pa&s;&s;ed, except a body under Count Clermont, who &s;till re|mained at We&s;el, and re&s;olved to maintain that po&s;t. The French army, which about four months before had pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine in numbers, and in a condition to make the mo&s;t power|ful enemies tremble, without any ad|ver&s;e &s;troke of war what&s;oever, by a fate almo&s;t unparalleled, now re|pa&s;&s;ed it like fugitives, in a condition the mo&s;t deplorable, reduced to le&s;s than half their original number, and clo&s;ely pur&s;ued by the enemy, which they had obliged to lay down their arms.</P>
<P>The &s;ame ill fortune, and the &s;ame de&s;pair of their affairs, followed them every where. On the arrival of a &s;mall Engli&s;h &s;quadron, commanded by Commodore Holmes, before Emb|den, and their taking an ad|vantageous &s;ituation, which <NOTE PLACE="marg">March 18.</NOTE> cut off the communication between the town and the mouth of the river Ems; the French garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting of 4000 <NOTE PLACE="marg">19.</NOTE> men, immediately evacuated the place. As &s;oon as Mr. Holmes di&s;|covered their de&s;ign, and that they were tran&s;porting their artillery and baggage up the river, he ordered out a few armed boats to pur&s;ue them. The&s;e took &s;ome of the enemy's ve&s;|&s;els, in which were the &s;on of an of|ficer of di&s;tinction, and a con&s;iderable &s;um of money. The Commodore without delay re&s;tored the &s;on to his father, and offered to return the mo|ney, on receiving the officer's word of honour, that it was his private property. This affair is mentioned, not only to do ju&s;tice to the judicious conduct by which a place of &s;o much con&s;ideration was &s;o ea&s;ily carried, but al&s;o to that genero&s;ity of &s;pirit, which &s;o nobly di&s;tingui&s;hes almo&s;t all tho&s;e, who hold any rank in our &s;ervice.</P>

<P>WHILST the French arms &s;uffered &s;uch di&s;graces a|broad, they endeavoured by an al|teration of their councils at home, to re&s;tore their credit. Their mini&s;ters had been long the &s;port of female ca|price; it was their power of plea&s;ing a mi&s;tre&s;s who governed their King, that alone qualified them to &s;erve their country. Some of the mo&s;t able men were turned out of their employ|ments with di&s;grace; others retir|ed from the publick &s;ervice with indignation; a certain low cha|racter had for a long time appeared in all the proceedings of France, both within and without. Even in their dome&s;tic di&s;putes, and where &s;omething of a free and manly &s;pirit appeared, this &s;pirit evapo|rated, and &s;pent it&s;elf upon un|worthy and de&s;picable objects. The&s;e conte&s;ts which involved the church, the law, and the crown, weakened them all; and the &s;tate felt all the ill effects of di&s;union of its orders, without &s;eeing an augmentation of power thrown in|to the &s;cale of any. But now taught by their misfortunes and di&s;graces, they were obliged to an alteration in their conduct: they were obliged to call men to the public &s;ervice upon public prin|ciples; at a time indeed, when in many re&s;pects things could only be altered not mended; and wi&s;e and able mini&s;ters could do little more by their penetration and public &s;pirit, than to &s;ee and lament the ruin, cau&s;ed by the want of tho&s;e virtues in their predece&s;&s;ors. The Duke de Bellei&s;le, known to all Europe for his great abilities, and his great exploits, was at length placed at the head of the military department, as Secretary at war.</P>
<P>There appeared in the common prints a &s;peech, &s;aid to be made by that nobleman in council; which, if it be not authentic, contains at lea&s;t &s;uch &s;entiments, as would come not unnaturally from a French patriot, and one who had &s;erved his King and country with honour during better times.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;I know, &s;aid he, the &s;tate of our armies. It gives me great grief, and no le&s;s indignation: for be&s;ides the real evil of the di&s;order in it&s;elf, the di&s;grace and infamy which it reflects on our government, and on the whole nation, is &s;till more to be apprehended. The choice of of|ficers ought to be made with ma|ture deliberation. I know but too well to what length the want of di&s;cipline, pillaging and robbing have been carried on by the officers and common men, after the example &s;et them by their generals. It mortifies me to think I am a Frenchman; my principles are known to be very different from tho&s;e which are now followed. I had the &s;atisfaction to retain the e&s;teem, the friend&s;hip and the con&s;ide|ration, of all the princes, noble|men,
<PB N="38" REF="50">
and even all the com|mon people in all parts of Ger|many where I command the King's forces. They lived there in the mid&s;t of abundance; eve|ry one was plea&s;ed; it fills my &s;oul with angui&s;h, to find that at pre&s;ent the French are held in execration; that every body is di&s;pirited and that many offi|cers publicly &s;ay things that are criminal and highly puni&s;hable. The evil is &s;o great that it de|mands immediate redre&s;s. I can ea&s;ily judge, by what pa&s;&s;es in my own brea&s;t, of what our ge|nerals feel from the &s;peeches they mu&s;t daily hear in Ger|many, concerning our conduct; which indeed would lo&s;e much to be compared with that of our allies. I mu&s;t particularly com|plain of the delays and irregu|larity of the po&s;ts; a &s;ervice which is very ill provided for. I am likewi&s;e di&s;plea&s;ed with the negligence of our generals in returning an&s;wers; which is a manife&s;t breach of their duty. Had I commanded the army, a thou&s;and things which are done, would not have been done; and others, which are neglected, would have been executed. I would have multiplied my com|munications; I would have had &s;trong po&s;ts on the right, on the left, and in the center, lined with troops. I would have had ma|gazines in every place. The quiet and &s;atisfaction of the country &s;hould have been equal to their pre&s;ent di&s;&s;affection, at being hara&s;&s;ed and plundered; and we &s;hould have been as much beloved, as we are at pre&s;ent abhored. The con&s;e|quences are too apparent to need being mentioned. I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t on the&s;e things, becau&s;e late re|dre&s;s is better than the continua|tion of the evil.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>M. de Bellei&s;le being e&s;tabli&s;hed in his office, turned all his attenti|on to the cure of the evils, which he lamented; and exerted all the power that remained in the nation, to put their army in Germany once more upon a re&s;pectable footing. The expedition into Germany was originally a mea&s;ure as contrary to the true intere&s;ts of France, as it was ju&s;tice and equity; but having adopted that mea&s;ure, the con&s;equences which aro&s;e &s;eemed to demand that it &s;hould be pur|&s;ued with vigour. Therefore the connection with the Empre&s;s Queen was drawn clo&s;er than ever, and nothing was omitted to give a greater &s;trength, and a better or|der to the army on the Rhine. But the&s;e endeavours which &s;train|ed all the &s;inews of France, already too much weakened by the almo&s;t total ruin of &s;everal e&s;&s;ential bran|ches of their trade, drew away all the recources nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport their navy. It was then in a &s;uf|ficiently bad condition, from a want of &s;eamen and &s;tores; and there were no means found, or little attention u&s;ed, to re&s;tore it: &s;o that from a deficiency in the ma|rine, it &s;eemed to be equally im|practicable to feed the war in A|merica, or to pre&s;erve the coa&s;t of France it&s;elf from in&s;ults. Such was the condition of our enemies, at the opening of the campaign of 1758.</P>
<P>As to England, far from being exhau&s;ted by the war, or di&s;pirited by our ill &s;ucce&s;s, our hopes ro&s;e from our di&s;appointments, and our re&s;ources &s;eemed to be augmented by our expences; with &s;uch ea&s;e and alacrity were the nece&s;&s;ary &s;up|granted
<PB N="39" REF="51">
and rai&s;ed. Many errors and many abu&s;es which the war di&s;covered without making fatal, were corrected. The &s;pirit of our officers was revived by fear or by &s;hame. Our trade was well pro|tected by the &s;uperiority, and pru|dent di&s;tribution of our naval force. The revenue was frugally manag|ed, and the whole &s;tate well ce|mented and bound together in all its parts, by the union of the admi|ni&s;tration, by the patrioti&s;m which animated it, and by the entire confidence which the people had in the pre&s;iding abilities and inten|tions. As France per&s;i&s;ted in her attachment to the enemies of his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty, Great Britain en|tered into &s;till clo&s;er engagements with that monarch, the lu&s;tre of who&s;e virtues, &s;et off by his late wonderful &s;ucce&s;&s;es, quite turned our eyes from the objections which were rai&s;ed again&s;t the con&s;i&s;tency of that alliance with our intere&s;ts. How far it is con&s;i&s;tent with them, is, I think, a much more difficult point to &s;ettle, than the adherents to either party &s;eem willing to allow. But it ought to be con|&s;idered, that the circum&s;tances of affairs in the beginning of the war, hardly admitted of any other choice; it had been the height of madne&s;s to have been on ill terms with his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty at that time; and it was impo&s;&s;ible to have kept good terms with him, without being on very bad ones with Vienna. Things were in an ill &s;ituation; and the ballance of Germany was in dan|ger of being over&s;et, what party &s;oever &s;hould prevail. It was im|po&s;&s;ible that England could have &s;tood neuter in this conte&s;t: if &s;he had, France would not have imi|tated her moderation; &s;he would gladly have joined with the King of Pru&s;&s;ia to di&s;tre&s;s Hanover, and reduce Au&s;tria. The&s;e two powers &s;o exerted, would doubtle&s;s com|pa&s;s their end, unle&s;s we interpo&s;ed to prevent it; and we mu&s;t &s;ooner or latter have interpo&s;ed, unle&s;s we were re&s;olved tamely to &s;ee France and her allies giving laws to the continent. In a word, France would certainly have joined with one par|ty or the other, and the party which &s;he joined, would certainly, by that union, prove dangerous to the com|mon liberty, and mu&s;t therefore be oppo&s;ed by us; we mu&s;t have been in &s;pite of us engaged in the troubles of Germany, as we ever have been, and ever &s;hall be, as long as we are a people of con&s;ideration in Europe. The al|liance with Pru&s;&s;ia was pointed out to us by the circum&s;tance of his acting on the defen&s;ive. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia meditated no con|que&s;ts. But her Imperial maje&s;ty indi&s;putably aimed at the recovery of Sile&s;ia, which was to di&s;turb the &s;ettled order of things; and this de&s;ign was the only cau&s;e of the troubles in that part of the world. I am &s;en&s;ible that this is notwith|&s;tanding all that may be &s;aid, a que&s;tion of &s;ome intricacy, and re|quires a con&s;ideration of many more particulars, than the brevity of our de&s;ign will allow. But whether we cho&s;e our party in this al|liance judiciou&s;ly or not, we have, I imagine, very great rea&s;on to be plea&s;ed with a mea&s;ure, which has induced France to engage &s;o deep|ly in the affairs of Germany, at &s;o ruinous an expence of her blood and trea&s;ure. Our mini&s;try was at this time fully convinced of the prudence of the choice that had been made, and re&s;olved to &s;up|port his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty, and the army under Prince Ferdinand, in the

mo&s;t effectual manner; 100,000 l. was voted for the Hanoverian and He&s;&s;ian forces; and a convention between the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, and his Britannic maje&s;ty, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ap. 11.</NOTE> was &s;igned at London, whereby the King of Great Britain engages to pay his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty the &s;um of 670,000 pounds &s;terling; and each of the contracting powers en|gage to conclude no peace with|out the participation of the other.</P>
<P>The northern courts made no alteration in their &s;y&s;tem. In Swe|den, &s;ome real plots to di&s;turb the e&s;tabli&s;hed con&s;titution ended in the ruin of their contrivers; &s;ome ficti|tious plots were &s;et on foot to give a &s;anction to mea&s;ures again&s;t the crown party, which an&s;wered their ends; and, as the ruling power continued the &s;ame, and the inter|nal di&s;&s;en&s;ions the &s;ame, the ho&s;ti|lities again&s;t the King of Pru&s;&s;ia were re&s;olved with the former ani|mo&s;ity, but promi&s;ed to be pur&s;ued with the former languor. In Ru&s;|&s;ia, the Empre&s;s did not think her intentions well &s;econded by her mini&s;ters. The great delays, and the unaccountable retreat in the la&s;t campaign, gave ground to &s;u&s;|pect, that &s;he had been betrayed by her mini&s;ters, or her generals. M. Apraxin was removed from the command, and was put under arre&s;t. He ju&s;tified his conduct by expre&s;s orders from Count Be&s;tuchef. Be&s;|tuchef was removed from his office, and put under arre&s;t al&s;o. Count Woronzoff &s;uceeded Be&s;tuchef in his employment, and the Generals Brown and Fermor took the com|mand of the army in the place of Apraxin.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the &s;ea&s;on permitted the King of Pru&s;&s;ia to re|commence his operations, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ap. 3.</NOTE> he laid &s;iege to Schweidnitz, and pu&s;hed it with &s;o much vigour, that the place &s;urrendered in thirteen days. The garri|&s;on <NOTE PLACE="marg">16.</NOTE> reduced by &s;ickne&s;s during the blockade, and by their lo&s;&s;es during the &s;iege, from &s;even to little more than three thou&s;and men, yielded them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war. By this &s;troke, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia left his enemies no footing in any part of his dominions. His next con&s;i|deration was how to guard again&s;t their future attempts, and at the &s;ame time to make a vigorous at|tack upon &s;ome part of the Au&s;trian territories. His forces were well &s;tationed for both the&s;e purpo&s;es; for be&s;ides the troops which Count Dohna commanded on the &s;ide of Pomerania, a con&s;iderable body was po&s;ted between Wohlau and Glogau, in order to cover Sile&s;ia from the fury of the Ru&s;&s;ians, in ca&s;e they &s;hould make their inroad that way. An army, in a little time after was formed in Saxony, com|manded by his brother Prince Henry, which con&s;i&s;ted of thirty battalions, and forty-five &s;quadrons. It was de&s;tined to make head again&s;t the army of the Empire, which by amazing efforts made during the winter, and by the junction of a large body of Au&s;trians, was now in a condition to act again. A ready communication was kept up between all the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's armies, by a proper choice of po&s;ts.</P>
<P>The King re&s;olved to make Mo|ravia the theatre of the war this year. Moravia was fre&s;h ground; a country as yet untouched by the ravages of war. If he &s;hould &s;uc|ceed in his operations in this coun|try, his &s;ucce&s;&s;es by opening to him the neare&s;t road to Vienna, mu&s;t prove more deci&s;ive than they could any where el&s;e. If he &s;hould
<PB N="41" REF="53">
fail, the Au&s;trians were at a di&s;|tance from the center of his affairs, and would find it difficult to im|prove their advantages to his ruin. After the reduction of Schweidnitz, the King ordered two bodies of his troops to po&s;t them&s;elves in &s;uch a manner, as to make it appear that he intended to carry the war into Bohemia. Whil&s;t he drew away the enemies attention from the real objects by the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions, the main of his army, by a very rapid march, entered <NOTE PLACE="marg">May 3.</NOTE> into Moravia in two columns, and made them&s;elves ma&s;ters, in a &s;hort time and with little or no oppo&s;i|tion, of all the po&s;ts nece&s;&s;ary to cover the troops to be employed in the &s;iege of Olmutz. On the 27th of May the trenches were opened before that city.</P>
<P>M. Daun was no &s;ooner appri&s;ed of the King's march towards Mo|ravia, than he took his route through Bohemia to that province. Notwith&s;tanding that the Empre&s;s Queen omitted no po&s;&s;ible endea|vours to a&s;&s;emble a ju&s;t army a|gain&s;t the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, though &s;he had for that purpo&s;e exhau&s;ted the Milane&s;e and Tu&s;cany, and &s;wept up the la&s;t recruits in her Danubian territories, M. Daun was not yet in a condition to give the King of Pru&s;&s;ia battle; neither did his character lead him to tru&s;t that to fortune, which he might en&s;ure, though more &s;lowly, by conduct. This wi&s;e General took his po&s;ts from Gewics to Lit|tau, in a mountainous country, in a &s;ituation where it was impo&s;&s;ible to attack him. He had the fertile country of Bohemia, from whence he readily and certainly drew &s;up|plies, at his rear. He was from his po&s;ition at the &s;ame time enabled to hara&s;s the Pru&s;&s;ian army before Olmutz, and to intercept the con|voys which were brought to them from Sile&s;ia.</P>
<P>Olmutz, by the extent of its works, and other advantageous circum&s;tances, is a city which it is very difficult compleatly to inve&s;t. So that &s;ome of the King's po&s;ts being nece&s;&s;arily weakened by oc|cupying &s;o great an extent of country, were attacked by Daun's detachments from time to time, with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that abundant &s;uc|cours both of men and ammunition were thrown into the place. The&s;e attacks were always made by night, and very few nights pa&s;&s;ed with|out &s;ome attack. The &s;ucce&s;s was various. But the operations of the &s;iege were greatly di&s;turbed by the&s;e continual alarms. Be&s;ides it is &s;aid that the Au&s;trians, before the King's inva&s;ion of this province, had de|&s;troyed all the forage in the neigh|bourhood of Olmutz. The hor&s;e were obliged to forage at a great di&s;tance, which hara&s;&s;ed them ex|treamly. M. Daun took advan|tage of all the&s;e circum&s;tances. It was in vain that the King of Pru&s;|&s;ia endeavoured by all the arts of a great commander to provoke or entice him to an engagement. He profited of the advantages he had made, without being tempted by them to throw out of his hands the &s;ecure game he was playing.</P>
<P>The great object of M. Daun was the Pru&s;&s;ian convoys. On re|ceiving advice that a large and impor|tant one was to leave Troppau on the 25th of June, he took mea&s;ures to intercept it. He ordered Gene|ral Jahnus, who was at Muglitz on the left, to advance towards Bahrn, and a detachment which was at Prerau at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance to the right, to march to Stadt-Leibe; &s;o that the&s;e two corps &s;hould on
<PB N="42" REF="54">
different &s;ides attack the convoy at one and the &s;ame time. To further the execution of this project M. Daun him&s;elf approached the Pru&s;|&s;ian army, and directed all his mo|tions as if he intended to give them battle. However, the King was too great a ma&s;ter in the game of gene|ral&s;hip, which was now playing, to be deceived by this feint. He de|tached a con&s;iderable party under General Ziethen, to &s;upport his con|voy, which was already about 7000 &s;trong. Before this detachment could come up, the convoy was attacked, but the Au&s;trians were repul&s;ed. But M. Daun, who provided for every thing, quickly reinforced his parties who renewed the engagement the next day. They fir&s;t &s;uffered the head of the convoy to go unmo|le&s;ted; but as the center was &s;till em|barra&s;&s;ed in a dangerous defile, they ea&s;ily cut off the head from the re&s;t, and then they attacked the center with the greate&s;t fury. The Pru&s;&s;ians made as good a re&s;i&s;tance as the na|ture of the ground would &s;uffer. Ge|neral Ziethen did every thing which could be expected from an accom|pli&s;hed officer; but in the end they were entirely routed; all the wag|gons in that divi&s;ion were taken; the rear was pu&s;hed back towards Trop|pau; the head alone with great diffi|culty arrived at the Pru&s;&s;ian camp.</P>
<P>This was a fatal &s;troke, becau&s;e it came at a time when it was im|po&s;&s;ible to repair it. The &s;iege of Olmutz had been all along attended with great difficulties; and now the news which every day arrived of the nearer and nearer approach of the Ru&s;&s;ians, called the King loudly to the defence of his own dominions. Already the Co&s;&s;acks and Calmucks made incur&s;ions into Sile&s;ia, and by their ravages and cruelties, an|nounced the approach of the great army. The &s;iege mu&s;t be rai&s;ed; Moravia mu&s;t be abandoned; Mar|&s;hal Daun mu&s;t have the honour of freeing his country, and driving a|way &s;uch an adver&s;ary as the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, from a conque&s;t deemed certain; all was performed without a battle, by a &s;eries of the mo&s;t refined and vigorous manoeuvres that ever were put in practice.</P>
<P>When the King of Pru&s;&s;ia &s;aw that the unpro&s;perous &s;ituation of his affairs obliged him to retreat; he took a Re&s;olution, &s;uch as a vic|tory in&s;pires in others. He took advantage even of the excellent movement of M. Daun, by which that able general had advanced his quarters to Poznitz, and placed him&s;elf &s;o as to &s;upport Olmutz in the mo&s;t effectual manner; by this movement, however, he was obliged to uncover the frontiers of Bohemia. The King of Pru&s;|&s;ia, whom nothing could e&s;cape, was &s;en&s;ible of this advantage, and therefore, in&s;tead of falling back upon Sile&s;ia, which &s;tep would im|mediately have drawn the Au&s;trian army into his dominions, he deter|mined to retreat from one part of the enemies territories into another. The day before the &s;iege was rai&s;ed the firing of the Pru&s;&s;ians continued as bri&s;k as ever, and &s;hewed no &s;ort of &s;ign of an intention to depart; but in the night the whole army took the road to Bo|hemia <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 1.</NOTE> in two columns, and gained an entire march upon the Au&s;trians. So that notwith&s;tanding the utmo&s;t efforts which the enemy could make to overtake and hara&s;s the King upon his march, he advanced into Bohemia with little mole&s;tation, &s;eized upon a large magazine at Leutomi&s;&s;el, defeated &s;ome corps of Au&s;trians who had attempted to di&s;turb him in his progre&s;s, and
<PB N="43" REF="55">
arrived at Konig&s;gratz, one of the mo&s;t important po&s;ts in Bohemia, with all his &s;ick and wounded, with all his heavy baggage, all his heavy artillery, and military &s;tores compleat. This place he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed after driving from it a body of 7000 Au&s;trians who were entrenched there. He immedi|ately laid this city and &s;everal other di&s;tricts under contribution; but his plan not admitting any further ope|rations on that &s;ide, he took no o|ther advantage from this momentous po&s;t. He &s;oon re-entered Sile&s;ia, and marched with the mo&s;t amazing diligence to encounter the Ru&s;&s;ians, who had at this time united their di|vided corps under Brown and Fer|mor, and fixed the long fluctuating plan of their operations, by entering the New Marche of Brandenburgh and laying &s;iege to Cu&s;trin. The reduction of this place could leave them but a few days march to Ber|lin; Count Dohna was not in a condition to oppo&s;e their progre&s;s, the King was &s;till at a great di&s;tance. But it is nece&s;&s;ary to break our narrative of his affairs, however intere&s;ting, to take a view of the operations of the armies on the Rhine. We leave the King of Pru&s;|&s;ia in full march, to give one body of his enemies battle, after execut|ing a retreat from the other, in a manner that did his military genius the greate&s;t honour. So that on the whole, it is difficult to &s;ay, which gained the greate&s;t glory, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia by his retreat, or M. Daun by the mea&s;ures which obliged him to it.</P>

<P>PRINCE Ferdinand had it not in his power to cut off the re|treat of the French over the Rhine; but he pre&s;&s;ed them clo&s;ely, and prepared him&s;elf to cro&s;s that river in pur&s;uit of them. His de&s;ign was to carry the war beyond the Mae&s;e, and thereby oblige the Prince de Soubi&s;e to abandon the enterpri&s;e he was preparing again&s;t He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el. His Highne&s;s executed the pa&s;&s;age of the Rhine at Herven with the corps immediately <NOTE PLACE="marg">June 1.</NOTE> under his command; then he &s;ent the bridge with which he &s;erved him|&s;elf &s;o well up the river to Rees; the re&s;t of the troops pa&s;&s;ed there; the whole army were over before the 7th of June. The flattery of the la&s;t age &s;aw with a&s;toni&s;hment a pa&s;&s;age of the Rhine by a French monarch, unoppo&s;ed, at the head of a mighty army. We &s;aw that river pa&s;&s;ed by the enemies of France, in the pre&s;ence of an army of 50,000 of that nation; it was an action which did not need the exagge|rations of rhetoric.</P>
<P>The French army retired as the Prince advanced, and took an ad|vantageous camp which threatened to retard the operations of the allies. Their right was under Rheinberg; but the Prince by his well judged motions turned their left flank to|wards the convent of Campe, by which the French found them&s;elves obliged to quit their advantageous po&s;t, and to retire into Meurs. They &s;till kept towards the Rhine. The Prince advanced on the &s;ide of the Mae&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="56">
It was evident, that whil&s;t the French continued only to retire, it would prove impo&s;&s;ible for them to hinder the allies from executing the plan they propo&s;ed. They therefore thought it advi&s;eable to change their countenance. They had fallen back as far as Nuys; they now returned on their &s;teps, and advan|ced as far as Crevelt, within a few miles of Prince Ferdinand's camp. The Prince made the di&s;po&s;itions for a battle, with his u&s;ual vigour and prudence. He carefully recon|noitred the &s;ituation of the enemy. He found that their right was at a village called Vi&s;chelon; their left extended towards Anrath, where it was covered with a wood: Crevelt, which was in the front of their right, was occupied by a party of their troops. His Highne&s;s re&s;olved upon three attacks. The fir&s;t and real attack was on the flank of the enemies left wing; the other two were de&s;igned to divert their atten|tion, and prevent their &s;uccouring the object of his principal attack; for which purpo&s;e he recommended to his generals to make the be&s;t u&s;e of their heavy artillery, and not to advance too far unle&s;s they were per|fectly a&s;&s;ured of the &s;ucce&s;s of the main operation.</P>
<P>Having made the&s;e wi&s;e di&s;po&s;i|tions, and perfectly learned the be&s;t routes by which <NOTE PLACE="marg">June 23.</NOTE> the enemy might be approached, his Highne&s;s put him&s;elf at the head of the grenadiers of his right wing, and advanced on the &s;ide of Anrath in two columns. A cannonading violent and well &s;upported opened the ac|tion. The Hanoverian artillery was greatly &s;uperior to that of the French; but though the French lo&s;t many men, they lo&s;t no ground in this way, and their po&s;ition in the wood made a clo&s;e attack ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary. The hereditary Prince of Brun&s;wick put him&s;elf at the head of the fir&s;t line of foot, and with his u&s;ual &s;pirit, advanced with the whole front directly to the wood. Here a furious fire of &s;mall arms commenced, which continued with|out the &s;malle&s;t intermi&s;&s;ion for two hours and an half. All the Ha|noverian battalions threw them&s;elves into the wood. Two ditches well lined with infantry were oppo&s;ed to their fury. They were forced one after another. The enemies batta|lions were pu&s;hed back, they were entirely broken, and fled out of the wood in a di&s;order which was irre|parable. Their cavalry, who kept the be&s;t countenance po&s;&s;ible, in &s;pite of the terrible fire of the Hanoverian artillery, and in &s;pite of the vigo|rous attempts of the Hanoverian hor&s;e, who had by this time found means to gain the plain, covered the retreat of their &s;cattered infantry, and &s;aved them from utter ruin. The right wing and the center, though they &s;uffered grievou&s;ly by the can|nonading, were no where broken, but retreated towards Nuys in the mo&s;t perfect order.</P>
<P>Seven thou&s;and of their be&s;t troops were killed, wounded, and taken pri&s;oners; but there was nothing in this battle &s;o grievous to France, and &s;o affecting even to the enemy, as the fate of the Count de Gi&s;ors. This young nobleman, the only &s;on of the Duke de Bellei&s;le, not above twenty-five years of age, newly married to the heire&s;s of an illu&s;trious hou&s;e; him&s;elf the la&s;t hope of a mo&s;t noble family, was mortally wounded at the head of his regiment, which he brought up with the mo&s;t heroic courage, and in&s;pired by his example to make
<PB N="45" REF="57">
incredible efforts. He had been educated with all the care an excel|lent father could be&s;tow on a &s;on of an uncommon genius, who was alone able to &s;upport the reputation of his family. To the pure&s;t morals he had united the polite&s;t manners; he had made a great proficiency in learning; he knew many branches of it, and loved all; he had &s;een every part of Europe, and read courts and nations with a di&s;cerning eye; and wanting nothing to fulfil all hope, and to make him a perfect and la&s;ting ornament and &s;upport to his country, but a knowledge in the military art; he entered that cour&s;e of glory and danger, and fell in his fir&s;t campaign. The unhappy father and mini&s;ter &s;aw his pri|vate misfortunes keep pace with the public calamities, and the tears of his family mingled with tho&s;e of his country.</P>
<P>Prince Ferdinand gained a victory at Crevelt, which did the great|e&s;t honour to his military capa|city and to the bravery of his troops. But it was a victory neither entire nor deci&s;ive. The French army on their own frontiers was quickly and &s;trong|ly reinforced: &s;o that they were not only in a condition in &s;ome &s;ort to make head again&s;t the allies, but were enabled to detach a con&s;iderable rein|forcement to the army of the Prince de Soubi&s;e on the other &s;ide of the Rhine.</P>
<P>Although the Prince had rea&s;on to imagine that he &s;hould not be able to keep his ground on this &s;ide of the Rhine for any con&s;iderable time, this did not hinder him from improving to the utmo&s;t the ad|vantage he had obtained. Whil&s;t the French di&s;abled by their late defeat, were in no condition to oppo&s;e him, he pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine with a large detachment, and ap|peared on the 28th of June be|fore Du&s;&s;eldorp, a city advantage|ou&s;ly &s;ituated on the river, and belonging to the Elector Palatine. A &s;evere bombardment obliged it to capitulate on the 7th of July. The garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting of 2000 men, marched out with the honours of war. Prince Ferdinand placed here three battalions of Hanove|rians, and threw a bridge of boats acro&s;s the river; by that means he multiplied his po&s;ts and com|munications on both &s;ides of the Rhine; and threw a new and no &s;mall impediment in the way of the French, to retard their progre&s;s, in ca&s;e he &s;hould find him&s;elf compelled to retire. After this, the army of the allies and that of France, &s;pent &s;everal days in mak|ing various marches and counter|marches, as if they both pro|po&s;ed to bring on an action, to which however, it does not appear that either party was very &s;trongly inclined.</P>
<P>Prince Ferdinand &s;till retained his hopes that the Prince of Y&s;en|burg, who commanded the He&s;&s;ian troops, would find the Prince of Soubi&s;e employment for &s;ome time. He had originally laid his plan in &s;uch a manner, that by pa&s;&s;ing the Mae&s;e and transferring the &s;eat of war into the enemies country, he might draw the French from the Rhine, and perhaps oblige the Prince of Soubi&s;e to come to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the main army under M. de Contades, who commanded in the room of Count Clermont, being now the fourth commander of the French troops &s;ince they en|tered Germany. But whil&s;t Prince Ferdinand plea&s;ed him&s;elf with tho&s;e hopes, and &s;till continued to act as far as circum&s;tances would ad|mit, in pur&s;uance of this plan he
<PB N="46" REF="58">
received an account which di&s;con|certed all his mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>The Duke de Broglio &s;upport|ed by the corps of the Prince de Soubi&s;e, with a much &s;uperior force, attacked and defeated the He&s;&s;ian army of &s;even <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 23.</NOTE> thou&s;and men near Sanger&s;hau&s;en. This opened to them the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the We&s;er. They might act in We&s;tphalia, on which &s;ide &s;o ever they plea&s;ed, and it was to be feared, that if they availed them|&s;elves of the advantages they had, they might be able to intercept the Briti&s;h troops. The&s;e troops having been landed at Embden, were now on their march under the command of the Duke of Marlborough to reinforce the al|lied army. The Prince in this &s;ituation of affairs, had no option left but an engagement with the French army or a retreat over the Rhine. The former was not ea&s;y to compa&s;s, as the French indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly declined a battle, and it be|came extremely dangerous to re|main long in a po&s;ition with the enemies army on his left, and the &s;trong fortre&s;s of Gueldre on his right. In this &s;ituation his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence became every day more difficult. To repa&s;s the Rhine, had its difficulties too; the roads which led to that ri|ver were rendered almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able by the heavy rains; the river it&s;elf was &s;o &s;welled with them, that the bridge at Rees had been for &s;ome time u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>The&s;e di&s;agreeable circum&s;tances of the allied army did not e&s;cape the penetration of Mon&s;ieur de Chevert, one of the able&s;t com|manders among the French. He formed a plan upon them, which if it had &s;ucceeded, mu&s;t have put the allies into the greate&s;t perplexity. This general had &s;ome time before pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine, with an intention of making him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Du&s;&s;eldorp, and he had prepared all things with great ability for that enterpri&s;e. The rains unu&s;ually heavy for that &s;ea&s;on, and &s;ome other cro&s;s accidents, had fru&s;trated his inten|tions. But perceiving that the &s;ame accidents which defeated his de&s;ign proved al&s;o unfavourable to the enemy, he re&s;olved to turn his di&s;appointment into an advan|tage, and from the ruins of his fir&s;t project to build another of yet greater importance. Baron Im|hoff was po&s;ted to the right of the Rhine in a &s;trong &s;ituation near Meer. He was to cover the bridge at Rees; to &s;ecure a con&s;iderable magazine; and to keep open com|munication between the Engli&s;h reinforcements and the main army. The plan of Mon&s;ieur Chevert was to di&s;lodge Imhoff, to burn the bridge at Rees, to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the magazine, and to ren|der the junction of the Engli&s;h troops with the Hanoverians im|practicable. To execute this judi|cious &s;cheme, he united &s;everal de|tachments from the garri&s;on of We|&s;el, to a con&s;iderable corps which he intended to have employed in the &s;iege of Du&s;&s;eldorp. The whole made near 12,000 men. The troops under Imhoff were but &s;ix battalions; and four &s;quadrons, hard|ly 3000 in all.</P>
<P>When that general was ap|pri&s;ed of the de&s;igns and motions of the French, he &s;aw it was in vain to expect &s;uccours from the army of Prince Ferdinand. The &s;well of the river had rendered all relief impo&s;&s;ible; all his hopes were therefore in his own genius and the bravery of his troops. He con&s;idered that though the
<PB N="47" REF="59">
po&s;t he occupied was &s;ufficiently &s;trong, the enemy might make them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Rees, by turning his camp, and thus exe|cute one of the principal parts of their de&s;ign; he con&s;idered the great difference between attacking and being attacked; he con&s;idered the effect of an attempt altogether unexpected by the enemy; he there|fore took the re&s;olution of abandon|ing his po&s;t, and going out to meet them. Perceiving that the French were marching into diffi|cult ground, he did not lo&s;e a mo|ment <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 5.</NOTE> to begin the action. He ordered a &s;mall party, which he had po&s;ted in a little coppice, to fall upon the ene|mies left, which he ob&s;erved to be uncovered; and appointed the fire of this party, as a &s;ignal for all the re&s;t to advance, and make the on|&s;et with bayonets fixed. The French thus vigorou&s;ly and unex|pectedly attacked, fell into confu|&s;ion; their courage ill &s;econded the wi&s;dom of their general; they did not &s;tand half an hour; they left on the field of battle, eleven pie|ces of cannon, many pri&s;oners, and much baggage to the Hanoverians, who drove them under the cannon of We&s;el.</P>
<P>This &s;ignal advantage over &s;uch a prodigious &s;uperiority was not more gallantly obtained, than well pur&s;ued and improved. Imhoff &s;aw that the rains had increa&s;ed to &s;uch a degree, as to leave no hopes for the allied army to pa&s;s by the bridge at Rees. Having taken proper care of his magazines, he quitted his po&s;t at Meer, and being reinforced by &s;ome parties, who pa&s;&s;ed the river in boats, he march|ed with the utmo&s;t diligence to|wards the $oute of the Engli&s;h forces, and happily effected a junc|tion, which had hitherto been at|tended with &s;o many difficulties.</P>
<P>Prince Ferdinand in his retreat met with no ob&s;truction, but ju&s;t what was &s;ufficient to di&s;play more fully the gallantry of his officers, and the &s;pirit of his troops. A town called Wachtendonck was on his left, as he retreated; this place, though not fortified, is a po&s;t of much importance, and being an i&s;land &s;urrounded by the river Ni|ers, is extremely difficult of acce&s;s. The French had thrown a body of troops into this place. The here|ditary Prince, the fir&s;t in every ac|tive &s;ervice, was employed to force it. The bridge on his approach had been drawn up. The Prince &s;eeing that if he attempted to get down this bridge, the enemy would gain time to recollect them&s;elves, threw him&s;elf into the river; his grenadiers, animated by &s;o gallant an example, plunged in after him, and furiou&s;ly attacking the enemy with their bayonets, in a few mi|nutes drove them from that po&s;t. This advantage, joined to that gained by General Imhoff, and the uncommon re&s;olution which ap|peared in both the&s;e actions, awed the French. They found that their troops, raw, undi&s;ciplined, and little fit for hard &s;ervice, were not to be relied upon; and they feared to bring on an action, which by being deci&s;ive again&s;t them might draw on the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences. So that the Prince repa&s;&s;ed the Rhine in a mo&s;t excellent order, even with le&s;s trouble than he had at fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ed it; and indeed with little mole&s;tation, but what he met with from the weather. Such exce&s;|&s;ive rains had fallen, that he in vain attempted a pa&s;&s;age at Rhineberg
<PB N="48" REF="60">
or at his bridge of Rees; he effected it a little lower <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 9. and 10.</NOTE> at a place called Griethuy|&s;en.</P>
<P>Although Prince Ferdinand was obliged to pa&s;s the Rhine, and to act more upon the defen&s;ive for the future; yet his vigorous conduct in the beginning was very glorious to him, and very advantageous to the common cau&s;e. The French &s;uf|fered greatly in their military repu|tation; the Hanoverians had gain|ed a &s;uperiority over them, and now &s;o much of the campaign was wa&s;ted, that notwith&s;tanding the greatne&s;s of their numbers, it was not probable that they would find them&s;elves able to make any con&s;i|derable progre&s;s in their de&s;igns again&s;t the King's electoral domi|nions for this year. The advan|tage gained by Broglio and Sou|bi&s;e was not attended with the con&s;equences, which might have been apprehended. Prince Y&s;en|burg kept &s;o good a countenance in a &s;trong po&s;t he had cho&s;en, that the French did not choo&s;e to at|tack him again; and &s;ince Prince Ferdinand had repa&s;&s;ed the Rhine, he might always be well &s;up|ported.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. <HI>Retreat from Bohemia. Mea&s;ures of Count Daun. Battle of Cu&s;trin. King of Pru&s;&s;ia marches into Saxony, and joins Prince Henry.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BY the retreat of the Pru&s;&s;ians from Moravia, the war had a&s;&s;umed a new face. The generals who conducted it had changed hands. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia was obliged to act upon the defen&s;ive; M. Daun was now in a condition of di&s;playing his talents in an of|fen&s;ive war. The affairs of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia were &s;carce ever in a more critical &s;ituation than at that time. The Ru&s;&s;ians &s;eemed at fir&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to enter into Si|le&s;ia; but now they had united their &s;everal disjointed corps, pene|trated into the New Marche of Brandenburgh, and having com|menced the &s;iege of Cu&s;trin, a place that threatened them with no great oppo&s;ition, they were arrived within a few days march of Berlin. Count Dohna po&s;ted with a great|ly inferior force at Frankfort on the Oder, watched without being able to ob&s;truct their progre&s;s. In Po|merania, the Generals Weedel and Manteufel oppo&s;ed almo&s;t the &s;ame ineffectual efforts to the arms of Sweden. The army of the Empire, and a con&s;iderable body of Au&s;tri|ans under General Haddick, ad|vanced into Saxony, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them&s;elves by degrees of tho&s;e &s;trong po&s;ts, which compo&s;e the frontiers of Mi&s;nia, they continually &s;treightened the quarters of Prince Henry. That Prince was &s;trongly encamped at Dippol&s;walde, with about 20,000 men, in order to cover Dre&s;den, and command the cour&s;e of the Elbe. Thus circum&s;tanced, the King could not find his account in remaining long in Bohemia, where it was impo&s;&s;ible to effect any thing deci&s;ive. Every thing depended upon his being able to drive the Ru&s;&s;ians out of his territories, who with a mighty force ruined every place they arrived at, and &s;eemed not only to make war again&s;t him, but again&s;t human nature it&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="61">
M. Daun was &s;oon appri&s;ed of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's intentions: but he con&s;idered that if he was to pur|&s;ue the King into Sile&s;ia, he mu&s;t encounter with difficulties almo&s;t in&s;uperable; &s;everal &s;trong places &s;tood in his way, and it would prove ea&s;y for the Pru&s;&s;ian troops left for the defence of that dutchy, to take an advantageous camp un|der one of tho&s;e places, and thus oblige them to wa&s;te unprofitably the time, which might be employ|ed in the execution of more judi|cious projects. Be&s;ides that in this manner of proceeding he could ne|ver act in concert, nor pre&s;erve any effectual communication with the &s;everal bodies of his allies. To pu&s;h forward with his whole force directly to Berlin, could at be&s;t be regarded as a <HI>coup de main,</HI> which could prove nothing deci&s;ive in the campaign, even &s;uppo&s;ing the project &s;hould &s;ucceed; but it was rather probable that it would not &s;ucceed, as the King of Pru&s;|&s;ia might clear his hands of the Ru&s;&s;ians before the army of M. Daun could, for want of &s;ub&s;i&s;|tance arrive in the Lower Lu&s;atia. Every con&s;ideration therefore point|ed out the relief of Saxony as the great object of the Au&s;trian opera|tions. It was an object apparently to be compa&s;&s;ed with greater ea&s;e, and if compa&s;&s;ed, productive of more &s;olid advantages than any other. The army of the Empire already &s;uperior to that of Prince Henry could co-operate in the de|&s;ign, and the recovery of Saxony once affected, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia would &s;ee him&s;elf entirely dive&s;ted of one of the principal re&s;our&s;es he had to rely upon in the war, for money, provi&s;ions, and forage; whil&s;t his hereditary dominions &s;tripped of this &s;trong barrier de|fencele&s;s in them&s;elves, and a&s;&s;aulted on three &s;ides by powerful armies, could &s;carce find them employment to the end of the campaign.</P>
<P>M. Daun having re&s;olved upon his plan of operations &s;uffered the King of Pru&s;&s;ia to continue his march towards the Ru&s;&s;ians, with|out any mole&s;tation: he contented him&s;elf with leaving a con&s;ider|able body of troops under the Ge|nerals Har&s;ch, and de Ville, on the &s;outhern frontiers of Sile&s;ia, in order to form &s;ome enterpri&s;e on that &s;ide, which might draw the attention and forces of the Pru&s;&s;ians as far as po&s;&s;ible from the great ob|ject of his operations. When he had made the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions he march|ed towards Saxony, through the country of Lu&s;atia, by Zittau, Gorlitz, and Bautzen. His fir&s;t project was bold. He propo&s;ed to cro&s;s the Elbe at Mei&s;&s;en; by which the communication between Dre&s;den and Leip&s;ic would be cut off at one &s;troke. Then he propo&s;ed to attack Prince Henry in his camp at Sedlitz, whil&s;t the army of the Em|pire fell upon him in another quarter. Thus the Prince was to be put be|tween two fires, and his retreat un|to Dre&s;den to be rendered impracti|cable; but upon mature con&s;idera|tion, this project was laid a&s;ide. M. Daun reflected that the for|tre&s;s of Sonne&s;tein, of which he was not yet in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, would prove no &s;mall impe|diment <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 3.</NOTE> to his de&s;igns. He con&s;idered that the po&s;ition of Prince Henry op|po&s;ite to the army of the Empire was too advantageous, to make an attack upon him advi&s;eable: and unle&s;s the Prince could be induced to attack the Imperiali&s;ts fir&s;t, a point not to be expected in his circum&s;tances, he might always find it ea&s;y to throw him&s;elf into Dre&s;den, and by pro|per
<PB N="50" REF="62">
motions to pre&s;erve a free-com|munication with the King. M. Daun was obliged to renounce his fir&s;t de|&s;ign, but he was left at full liberty to form and to execute &s;uch other plans for the relief of Saxony as his prudence could &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P>About that time the Imperial court elated with their recent &s;uc|ce&s;s, began to &s;hew with what moderation they were likely to behave if it continued and in|crea&s;ed. They entirely threw off all the little appearance of re&s;pect they had hitherto retained for the King of Great Britain, and &s;eve|ral other of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable Princes and per&s;ons of the Empire. They made the abu&s;e of their au|thority go hand in hand with the &s;ucce&s;s of their arms. On the 21&s;t of Augu&s;t a conclu&s;um of the Aulic council was i&s;&s;ued again&s;t the King of Great Britain, as E|lector of Hanover, again&s;t the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el, again&s;t Prince Ferdinand of Brun&s;wick, the Count of Lippe Buckebourg, and in general again&s;t all the ad|herents to the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, threatening them with penalties in dignity, per&s;on and e&s;tate. In con|&s;equence of this decree, letters a|vocatory were i&s;&s;ued, notifying to the &s;overeign Princes, that if they did not within a limited time di&s;|per&s;e their armies, break off their connection with the King of Pru&s;|&s;ia, pay their quota of Roman months, and &s;end their contingents to the army of execution, they were to be put under the ban of the Empire. To all other per&s;ons who held any dignity in the Empire, orders were given and penalties were threatened &s;uitable to their condition. They in &s;hort went all lengths but that of actually and formally putting them under the ban, which they would not have failed to do, if their &s;ucce&s;s had an&s;wered its beginnings. So little regard had the court of Vienna to former &s;ervices of the mo&s;t intere&s;t|ing nature; and &s;o entirely did &s;he &s;eem to forget that &s;he owed to the King of Great Britain, not only that power which &s;he now unju&s;tly and ungratefully turned a|gain&s;t him, but almo&s;t the very be|ing of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. So entirely did &s;he forget that this Monarch had expended his trea|&s;ures, employed his armies, and even expo&s;ed his per&s;on in her cau&s;e, when it was not only abandoned, but attacked by almo&s;t all the re&s;t of Europe. However the violent proceedings of the Aulic council, drew no one State or per&s;on from the Kings of Great Britain and Pru&s;&s;ia; they rather had a contrary effect, in rou&s;ing the whole Evan|gelic body to a &s;en&s;e of their own danger. Much le&s;s were they able to &s;top the progre&s;s of the al|lied arms.</P>
<P>The King of Pru&s;&s;ia conducted his retreat out of Bohemia in ad|mirable order. The Generals Jah|nus and Laudohn for &s;everal days hung upon his rear with two &s;trong bodies. They took advantageous po&s;ts, &s;ometimes on one &s;ide, &s;ome|times on the other, &s;ometimes to|gether, &s;ometimes &s;eparately, and threw all po&s;&s;ible impediments in his way. But the vigour of the Pru&s;|&s;ians drove them with lo&s;s from every po&s;t. So that by the 6th of Augu&s;t, they were obliged entirely to de&s;i&s;t from their pur&s;uit. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia freed from this mole&s;tation marched with the utmo&s;t diligence by Wi&s;oca, Politz, Land&s;hut, and arriv|ed on the 20th on Franckfort on the Oder. Here he joined the troops under Count Dohna. The army
<PB N="51" REF="63">
was now in a condition to act, and they did not lo&s;e <NOTE PLACE="marg">22d.</NOTE> a moment's time to march again&s;t the enemy. All their vigour and expedition was not more than ne|ce&s;&s;ary. The Ru&s;&s;ians had be|&s;ieged Cu&s;trin from the 15th. Though the&s;e people &s;carcely e|merged from barbari&s;m, had not the mo&s;t perfect &s;kill in operations of this nature, they &s;upplied that deficiency by a ferocity that &s;crupled nothing, by numbers who&s;e lives they did not regard, and by a mo&s;t formidable artillery, which rudely but furiou&s;ly managed, only &s;pread the more general and indi&s;crimi|nate de&s;truction. In effect, they threw &s;uch a multitude of bombs and red hot balls into that un|fortunate city, that in a &s;hort time, it was on fire in every quarter. Of the wretched inhabitants &s;ome were burned, &s;ome buried in the ruins, &s;ome killed by the balls that fell like hail in the &s;treets: the &s;urvi|ving majority &s;afe neither with|in nor without their hou&s;es, aban|doned their homes and their &s;ub|&s;tance, and fled, many of them al|mo&s;t naked, out of the city on the &s;ide which was not inve&s;ted. Never was beheld a more de|plorable &s;pectacle; nor was it ea&s;y to &s;ay which formed the more wretched appearance, tho&s;e who peri&s;hed, or tho&s;e who e&s;caped. Meanwhile the Governor, firm in his courage and fidelity, did every thing for the defence of the walls and ruins of the place; but the walls built in the old manner did not promi&s;e a &s;ucce&s;sful defence; the enemy had po&s;ted them&s;elves in the &s;uburbs, and in the firing of the town, the principal maga|zine of the be&s;ieged was blown up.</P>
<P>The protector and avenger of his dominions, was now however at hand. On the 23d, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's whole army pa&s;&s;ed the Oder at Glu&s;tebi&s;&s;el, about twenty Engli&s;h miles to the north-ea&s;t of Cu&s;trin. The Ru&s;&s;ians on the fir&s;t notice of his approach, broke up the &s;iege of that place, and march|ed towards the villages of Zwicker and Zorndorff. It was the King's intention to wind round the left flank of their army, and to take them in the rear, by which he hoped to throw them into con|fu&s;ion. But in this he found him|&s;elf di&s;appointed. The Ru&s;&s;ian Generals had fore&s;een his purpo&s;e and made excellent di&s;po&s;itions. As the ground did not admit them to extend greatly in length, they threw them&s;elves into a &s;quare body compo&s;ed of four lines, forming a front almo&s;t equal on every &s;ide, and on every &s;ide &s;urrounded by cannon and chevaux de frize. In this formidable di&s;po|&s;ition they waited the attack of the Pru&s;&s;ians.</P>
<P>It was on the 25th of Augu&s;t that the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, after a march of 56 days, from the mid&s;t of Mo|ravia, brought his army in pre&s;ence of the Ru&s;&s;ians. The king had ne|ver been per&s;onally engaged with that enemy before. His troops had never obtained any advan|tage over them. The whole for|tune of the war depended upon the event of this day. The Pru&s;&s;i|ans were now in the clo&s;e&s;t &s;en&s;e to fight for their country, which was ready to fall under one of the &s;evere&s;t &s;courges with which Pro|vidence has cha&s;ti&s;ed a nation. Nothing was wanting which could in&s;pire the &s;oldier with revenge. Every where the marks of the
<PB N="52" REF="64">
enemies cruelty were before their eyes; the country de&s;olated on every &s;ide, and the villages in &s;lames all round the field of battle.</P>
<P>At nine o'clock in the morn|ing the battle began by a fire of cannon and mortars which rained on the right wing of the Ru&s;&s;ians without the lea&s;t inter|mi&s;&s;ion for near two hours. No|thing could exceed the havock made by this terrible fire, nor the con&s;tancy with which the Mu&s;|covite foot, raw and unexperi|enced, &s;u&s;tained a &s;laughter that would have confounded and di&s;|per&s;ed the compleate&s;t veterans. They fell in their ranks; new regiments &s;till pre&s;&s;ed forward to fill their places, and to &s;upply new &s;laughter. When the fir&s;t line had fired away all their charges, they ru&s;hed forward on the Pru&s;&s;i|ans. That firm body of the Pru&s;&s;ian infantry which had often &s;tood, and often given &s;o many terrible &s;hocks, by one of tho&s;e unaccountable movements of the human mind, that render every thing in war &s;o precarious, gave way in the pre&s;ence of their So|vereign, and when they had in a manner &s;ecured the victory, retired in di&s;order before the half broken battalions of the Mu&s;covites. Had the Ru&s;&s;ian officers known how to profit of this di&s;order; had they immediately thrown in their hor&s;e with vigour to compleat it, and entirely break that body; this had probably been the la&s;t day of the Pru&s;&s;ian greatne&s;s. The king was not &s;o negligent. For ju&s;t in this anxious moment, whil&s;t the battle was yet in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, by a very rapid and ma&s;terly motion, he brought all the cavalry of his right to the center, which with General Sodlitz at their head, bur&s;ting in upon the Ru&s;&s;ian foot, uncovered by their hor&s;e, and di&s;|ordered even by their advantage, they pu&s;hed them back with a mo&s;t mi&s;erable &s;laughter The repul&s;ed battalions of Pru&s;&s;ia had time to recollect, and to form them&s;elves; and now returning to the on&s;et with a rage exa&s;perated by their late di&s;grace, they en|tirely turned the balance of the &s;ight. The Ru&s;&s;ians were thrown into the mo&s;t horrible confu&s;ion. The wind blew the du&s;t and &s;moke full in their faces. They no longer di&s;tingui&s;hed friends or enemies. They fired upon each other. In this di&s;traction they plundered their own baggage which &s;tood between the lines, and intoxicated them&s;elves with brandy. Orders were now no more heard or obeyed. The ranks fell in upon one another; and being crammed together in a narrow &s;pace, every &s;hot di&s;|charged by the Pru&s;&s;ians had its full effect; whil&s;t the Ru&s;&s;ians kept up only a &s;cattered fire, without direction or effect, and quite over the heads of their ene|mies. It was now no longer battle, but a horrid and undi&s;|tingui&s;hing carnage. Yet &s;till, (which is a wonderful circum&s;tance) the Ru&s;&s;ians thus di&s;tracted and &s;laughtered, kept their ground. The action continued without in|termi&s;&s;ion from nine in the morn|ing until &s;even at night. At la&s;t the night it&s;elf, the fatigue of the Pru&s;&s;ians, and a judicious attack on their right wing, which drew their attention on that &s;ide, gave the Ru&s;&s;ian army &s;ome re&s;pite to re|cover their order, and an oppor|tunity of retiring a little from the &s;cene of their di&s;a&s;ter. On their &s;ide near 10,000 fell upon

the &s;pot; they had more than 10,000 wounded, mo&s;t of them mortally; 939 officers, not in|cluding the inferior, were killed wounded and taken pri&s;oners; of two particular regiments con&s;i&s;ting before the battle of 4595 effective men, only 1475 were left; their whole lo&s;s on this bloody day was 21,529 men. That of the Pru&s;|&s;ians in every way did not amount to 2000.</P>
<P>The Gazettes of both parties warmly di&s;puted the vain honour of the field of battle. On the mo&s;t diligent enquiry, it appears that both parties &s;pent the night on or very near the place of action. But this is an affair of little con&s;equence. The Pru&s;|&s;ians had all the fruits, and mo&s;t of the proofs of a victory the mo&s;t complete and deci&s;ive. A va&s;t train of artillery taken, the military che&s;t, a number of pri|&s;oners, many of them officers of high rank; the retreat of the Ru&s;&s;ian army, the next and the fol|lowing days; their General Fer|mor's reque&s;t for leave to bury the dead; their incapacity to advance or form any new enterpri&s;e; the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's unmole&s;ted opera|tions again&s;t his other enemies; all the&s;e form the mo&s;t clear and cer|tain demon&s;tration of a victory in all the points, for which a victory is de&s;irable.</P>
<P>Nothing le&s;s indeed, than a very compleat victory could have done any e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to the King's affairs at that time, when four armies of his enemies were making their way to one common center, and threatened to unite in the heart of Brandenburg. The King renewed the attack on the Ru&s;&s;ians the next morning. The event of the la&s;t day had &s;hewed them, that there was no way of &s;afety but in a retreat, and in ef|fect they retreated before the Pru&s;&s;ians as far as Land&s;perg on the frontiers of Poland. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia was convinced that their late check mu&s;t wholly di&s;able them from attempting any thing material again&s;t his dominions on that &s;ide; and he &s;aw clearly that whatever he might hope to gain by improving his advantage a|gain&s;t the Ru&s;&s;ians, he mu&s;t lo&s;e far more by allowing his other ene|mies to make a progre&s;s on the &s;ide of Saxony. He &s;atisfied him|&s;elf therefore, with leaving a &s;mall body of troops under Count Dohna, to ob&s;erve the motions of the Mu&s;|covite army; and marched with the greate&s;t part of his forces and the utmo&s;t expedition to the relief of Prince Henry.</P>
<P>M. Daun having laid a&s;ide his fir&s;t project for pa&s;&s;ing the Elbe at Mei&s;&s;en, enterpri&s;ed nothing new on the &s;ide of Saxony for &s;ome days; he contented him&s;elf with taking a po&s;ition at Stolpen to the Ea&s;tward of the Elbe, by which, whil&s;t he pre&s;erved to him&s;elf an ea&s;y communication with the army of the Empire, he interrupted the communication between Bautzen and Dre&s;den; he favoured the o|perations of General Laudohn, who had advanced through the Lower Lu&s;atia to the confines of Branden|burgh; and by drawing the at|tention of the Pru&s;&s;ian forces which were left in Sile&s;ia to the northward of that dutchy, he facilitated the progre&s;s of the arms of the Generals Harach and de Ville in the &s;outhern parts. Admirable di&s;po&s;itions with|out que&s;tion, if the time had not called for more vigorous mea&s;ures, and if the re&s;cue of Saxony from the King of Pru&s;&s;ia had not been
<PB N="54" REF="66">
the great object of the campaign! It is not impo&s;&s;ible that the court of Vienna had &s;till &s;uch an hankering after Sile&s;ia, as induced them to &s;lacken their efforts on the &s;ide of Saxony, in hope, that if M. Daun could protract the operations there, &s;o as to find full employment for the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, their other forces might reduce Sile&s;ia with great facility; and thus perhaps by aiming at two &s;uch difficult objects at once, as it generally happens, they lo&s;t them both. Upon any other &s;uppo&s;ition, it is not very ea&s;y to account for the &s;eeming inactivity of M. Daun, whil&s;t he had &s;o fair a game in his hands. However advantageou&s;ly Prince Henry might have cho&s;en his po&s;t, or however &s;trongly he might have &s;ecured it, yet, the prodigious &s;uperiority of the combined armies &s;eems to have more than over-ba|lanced that advantage, and to have ju&s;tified, nay, to have demanded &s;ome bold and deci&s;ive attempt.</P>
<P>In fact, this appeared at length to be the Mar&s;hal's own opinion. For when the &s;trong fortre&s;s of Sonne&s;tein mo&s;t unac|countably &s;urrendered, with a gar|ri&s;on of 1400 men, to the Au&s;trian General Mac-Guire after the re&s;i&s;tance of no more <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 5.</NOTE> than a &s;ingle day; M. Daun pro|po&s;ed that the Prince of Deux-Ponts &s;hould attack Prince Henry, whil&s;t the grand army of the Au&s;|trians laying bridges between two fires, at a &s;mall di&s;tance from each other, &s;hould pa&s;s the Elbe, and falling at the &s;ame time on the Pru&s;&s;ians, &s;e|cond <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 10.</NOTE> the attack of the Imperiali&s;ts, and cut off the retreat of their ene|mies towards Dre&s;den. This was to bring matters to a &s;peedy de|ci&s;ion. But now the King of Pru&s;|&s;ia by the mo&s;t rapid marches had reached the frontiers of Saxony. The whole de&s;ign was di&s;concert|ed; and far from being able to di&s;|lodge Prince Henry, they found them&s;elves utterly unable to pre|vent the King his brother from joining him, with <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 11.</NOTE> his whole army. On his approach General Laudohn abandoned his ad|vantages in the Lower Lu&s;atia, and fell back upon M. Daun; who him|&s;elf retired from the neighbourhood of Dre&s;den and fell back as far as Zittau. The army of the Empire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;trong po&s;t of Pirna, which the Saxons had oc|cupied in the beginning of the war, kept their ground; but did not undertake any thing. Thus in fifteen days the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, by his unparallelled &s;pirit, dili|gence, and magnanimity, fought, and defeated a &s;uperior body of his enemies, in one extremity of his dominions, and baffled without fighting another &s;uperior body in the other extremity.</P>
<P>The&s;e advantages, glorious as they were, were not the only ones which followed the victory at Zorndorf. The Swedes who di|rected their motions by tho&s;e of their Ru&s;&s;ian allies, ha&s;tened their operations when that army had ad|vanced into Brandenburgh. Ge|neral Wedel was detached from Saxony, to &s;top their progre&s;s; and the Prince of Bevern, now Go|vernor of Stein, gave them &s;ome oppo&s;ition. All this, however, had proved ineffectual, if the news of the defeat of the Ru&s;&s;ians had not alarmed the Swedes in &s;uch a man|ner, as to make them return with more expedition than they had advanced. Tho' the King of Pru&s;|&s;ia's affairs began to put on a bet|ter appearance by the&s;e efforts, the
<PB N="55" REF="67">
fortune of the war &s;till hung in a very dubious &s;cale. The enemy was &s;till &s;uperior. The Swedes and Ru&s;&s;ians had &s;till &s;ome foot|ing in his dominions. The Au|&s;trians and Imperiali&s;ts were yet in Saxony; and if the King's ar|mies had it in their power to take &s;trong &s;ituations; the enemy had the &s;ame advantages. The con|dition of things was extremely critical, and the lea&s;t error or mi&s;|fortune threatened &s;till to plunge the King of Pru&s;&s;ia into an aby&s;s of calamities.</P>

<P>THE operations of the armies in We&s;tphalia, &s;eemed for a long time to langui&s;h. The grand army of the French under M. de Contades, was wholly unable to drive Prince Ferdinand from the po&s;ts which he had cho&s;en &s;o ju|diciou&s;ly along the Lippe. The other divi&s;ion of the French for|ces under the Prince de Soubi&s;e, had made no great progre&s;s on the &s;ide of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el, again&s;t the Prince I&s;enburg, who &s;till kept his ground in that principality, in or|der to protect the cour&s;e of the We&s;er, and to cover the electo|rate. The French were &s;en&s;ible that an attack on the principal army of the allies, would prove a very dangerous attempt, in which even if they &s;hould have &s;ome &s;uc|ce&s;s, their progre&s;s into the King's electoral dominions mu&s;t be very &s;low and difficult. But as the body of the allies employed in He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el was far the weake&s;t, and as an advantage on that &s;ide promi&s;ed them the command of the We&s;er, and a better pa&s;&s;age into the heart of the enemies coun|try, they determined to make an attempt there. To further this de&s;ign, a con&s;iderable detachment was made from the army of M. de Contades, which increa&s;ed the Prince of Soubi&s;e's corps to at lea&s;t 30,000 men. Prince Ferdinand, who was &s;ufficiently aware of the enemies plan, had &s;ome time be|fore &s;ent General Oberg with a &s;trong reinforcement to join the Prince I&s;enburg; but notwith&s;tand|ing this reinforcement, the whole force of the allies in He&s;&s;e did not exceed 15000. This body was at|tacked by the French at Lanwerenhagen, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 30.</NOTE> their great &s;uperiority, e&s;pecially in point of cavalry, obliged the allies to retire with the lo&s;s of about 1500 men. The allies unable to keep the field, had however &s;ome woods in their rear which covered their re|treat, and they pre&s;erved &s;o good a countenance as prevented their defeat from becoming total.</P>
<P>Great con&s;equences might have been apprehended from this affair.
<PB N="56" REF="68">
But the vigilance of Prince Ferdi|nand, who had e&s;tabli&s;hed the mo&s;t ready communications all along the Lippe, &s;uffered the victorious army to reap but little advantage from their victory. That accompli&s;hed General advanced with the utmo&s;t expedition towards Rheda, and the Prince I&s;enburg having fallen back upon him, they joined in &s;uch a manner as perfectly to &s;ecure the We&s;er, without lo&s;ing any thing on the &s;ide of the Rhine. And al|though the&s;e nece&s;&s;ary motions, in &s;ome &s;ort uncovered the electorate, &s;o as to lay it open to the incur&s;ions of the enemies light troops, who penetrated even to the gates of Ha|nover; yet the French were not in a condition to e&s;tabli&s;h any con&s;iderable body, or to take any po&s;t of moment in that part.</P>
<P>During this time, the armies of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia and M. Daun, made no very remarkable move|ments. The Mar&s;hal kept his ad|vantageous camp at Stolpen, by which he pre&s;erved a communica|tion with the army of the Em|pire. The army was &s;ecured by its inacce&s;&s;ible &s;ituation, but it enterpri&s;ed nothing of con&s;equence. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia on the other hand, having taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the important po&s;t of Bautzen, which lies &s;o opportunely for com|manding at once both Mi$$$a and Lu&s;atia, extended his $Word$ wing to Hohkirch. By this $Span$ he pre&s;erved a $Span$ with the army of his $Span$ Henry, he protected $Span$ from the incur&s;ions of $Span$, and at the &s;ame $Span$ he &s;ecured the&s;e intere&s;ting $Span$, he was better &s;ituated $Span$ throwing &s;uccours into Sile&s;$a, that he c$$ld be any where el&s;e con|&s;i&s;tently with his general plan. The two armies kept the mo&s;t watch|ful eye upon each others motions. The principal aim of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, &s;eemed to have been the preventing M. Daun from commu|nicating with Bohemia. The great intention of M. Daun was to cut off the King from Sile&s;ia. Things were &s;o ballanced, that it did not &s;eem po&s;&s;ible by mere &s;kill in marches and po&s;itions to an&s;wer the&s;e ends very fully: therefore a battle &s;eemed inevitable. But it &s;eemed too that con&s;idering the &s;itua|tions of both armies, a battle could not be attempted without extreme danger to the party who &s;hould be|gin the attack.</P>
<P>M. Daun &s;aw that if any more time was lo&s;t without action, the very &s;ea&s;on mu&s;t oblige him to evacuate Saxony, and thus give up all the fruits of the campaign. He came to a re&s;olution of giving the King of Pru&s;&s;ia battle. But even in the vigour of this re&s;olution, appeared the extreme caution which characteri&s;es that able General. Having communicated his de&s;ign to the Prince of Deux-Ponts, and &s;ettled mea&s;ures with him, he march|ed in the dead of a very dark night, in three columns, towards the right of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's camp. Notwith&s;tanding the dark|ne&s;s of the night, notwith|&s;tanding the nece&s;&s;ary di|vi&s;ion <NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 14.</NOTE> of the Au&s;trian army, the greatne&s;s of their numbers, and the length of way they had to march, yet &s;uch was the wi&s;e conduct and great good fortune of this de&s;ign, that they all arrived at the &s;ame time at the Pru&s;&s;ian camp, none having lo&s;t their way, without di&s;|covery, without confu&s;ion, and be|gan the attack with the utmo&s;t regularity and re&s;olution at 5 o'clock in the morning.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="69">
How the King's out guards were kept &s;o as to make &s;uch a &s;ur|pri&s;e practicable, is hard to &s;ay. It is hard to accu&s;e the vigilance of &s;o able a commander, or the attention of &s;o many fini&s;hed officers as &s;erved under him. To &s;peak of treachery is a way of accounting for misfortunes, more common than rea&s;onable. However it was, the Pru&s;&s;ians had not time to &s;trike their tents, when they found the enemy in the mid&s;t of the camp, and an impetuous attack already begun. Scarce had the battle be|gan, when a defeat &s;eemed cer|tain; not &s;o much from the con|fu&s;ion of the troops, as the irre|parable lo&s;s of two officers in the highe&s;t command, and of the greate&s;t merit. M. Keith received two mu&s;quet balls, and fell dead upon the &s;pot. Prince Francis of Brun&s;wick had his head &s;hot off by a cannon ball as he mounted his hor&s;e. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia had then the whole of affairs to &s;u&s;tain alone, at the time when he mo&s;t wanted a&s;&s;i&s;tance. But his pre&s;ence of mind, his firmne&s;s, his activity, remedied in &s;ome mea&s;ure the effects of this unfore&s;een at|tack, and the lo&s;&s;es and di&s;orders it had occa&s;ioned; he was every where pre&s;ent, and in&s;pired his troops with an ardor like his own. The King ordered &s;ome detach|ments from his left, to reinforce his right wing; but in the moment the Orders were received, the left it&s;elf was furiou&s;ly attacked. General Retzow who commanded in that quarter, with difficulty repul&s;ed the Au&s;trians, and was not able to af|ford any con&s;iderable a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the right, which was alone obliged to &s;upport the whole weight of the grand attack.</P>
<P>The Au&s;trians in the beginning of the engagement had beaten them out of the village of Hoh|kirchen; as the fate of the day depended upon that po&s;t, the hot|te&s;t of the di&s;pute was there. The Pru&s;&s;ians made three bloody and un&s;ucce&s;sful attacks on the vil|lage; on the fourth they carried it; but the Au&s;trians pouring con|tinually fre&s;h troops upon that &s;pot, drove them out at length after reiterated efforts, and a prodigious &s;laughter on all &s;ides. Then the King de&s;pairing of the fortune of that field, ordered a retreat; his troops which had been &s;uddenly attacked in a dark night by &s;uperior numbers, and had run to arms &s;ome half naked, and all in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion, had notwith&s;tand|ing made a mo&s;t vigorous re&s;i&s;tance, and maintained the fight for near five hours. They made their re|treat in good order without being pur&s;ued, &s;upported by the good countenance of their cavalry, and the fire of a numerous and well &s;erved artillery, which was placed in the center of their camp. They lo&s;t in this bloody action at lea&s;t 7000 men, killed, wounded and pri&s;oners, together with many cannon. The Au&s;trian account allowed their own lo&s;s in killed and wounded to amount to near 5000.</P>
<P>The King of Pru&s;&s;ia, in re|tiring from Hohkirchen, in fact only altered the po&s;ition of his right wing, which fell back as far as Wei&s;&s;enberg. His left &s;till re|mained at Bautzen. This po&s;ition was nearly as good as the former. The great lo&s;s, was the lo&s;s of reputation which always attends a defeat, and the lo&s;s of two great Generals which attended this in particular. M. Keith was a Scotchman born. He engaged with his brother the Lord Mar&s;hal in the Rebellion of 1715.
<PB N="58" REF="70">
Being obliged to relinqui&s;h his country on this occa&s;ion, he en|tered into the troops of Spain, and afterwards pa&s;&s;ing into Ru&s;&s;ia, he obtained a con&s;iderable com|mand, and performed many &s;ignal &s;ervices in their wars with Turky and Sweden; and &s;erved them al&s;o in peace by &s;everal emba&s;&s;ies. But finding the honours of that country no better than a &s;plendid &s;ervitude, and not meeting with tho&s;e rewards, which his long and faithful &s;ervices de&s;erved, he left that court for one where merit is better known and better re|warded; and having been employ|ed &s;ince the beginning of the war in a di&s;tingui&s;hed command in the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's armies, he fell at la&s;t in a &s;ervice that was worthy of him.</P>
<P>If the King of Pru&s;&s;ia lo&s;t &s;ome $$outation in &s;uffering him&s;elf to $$ &s;urpri&s;ed in this affair; he fully retrieved it by his extra|ordinary conduct in the cour&s;e of the action, and his admirable efforts after it. On the whole, per|haps, when all circum&s;tances are con&s;idered, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia will appear greater in this defeat, than in any victory he ever yet obtained. The wing of his army that was attacked, was &s;urpri&s;ed at a di&s;tance from him, the two Generals that commanded it &s;lain in the fir&s;t on&s;et, his other prin|cipal Generals wounded, the whole wing in confu&s;ion without a lea|der; to come, in the&s;e de&s;perate circum&s;tances, in ha&s;te from ano|ther quarter; to recover all; twice to repul&s;e the enemy, and at la&s;t to retire, overborn only by numbers and fatigue, without being pur&s;ued, is &s;uch an in&s;tance of great General&s;hip, as perhaps has never been exceeded.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e things were do|ing in Saxony, the Ru&s;&s;ians made no farther attempts on the &s;ide of Brandenburgh; they remained in their camp near Land&s;perg, until the 21&s;t of September; when after &s;everal feigned motions, made to cover their real de&s;ign, they began their retreat towards Po|merania, where they arrived on the 26th.</P>
<P>It was impo&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould keep their ground in that province during the winter, un|le&s;s they could &s;ecure &s;ome &s;ea|port, from whence they might be &s;upplied with provi&s;ions. The little town of Colberg was very opportune for that purpo&s;e, as it is a &s;ea-port on the Baltick, and &s;o meanly fortified, that the re|duction of it appeared to be as ea&s;y as expedient. On the third of October, they formed the &s;iege of this incon&s;iderable place, with a body of 15000 men. But &s;uch was the bravery of Major Heydon the Governor; and &s;uch the inca|pacity of the Ru&s;&s;ians for opera|tions of this nature, that this little town, defended only by a ram|part, without any outwork, and lined with a very feeble garri&s;on, held out again&s;t the repeated at|tacks of the enemy twenty-&s;ix days, and then obliged them to rai&s;e the &s;iege, without any <NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 29.</NOTE> &s;uccours what&s;oever from without. This was the la&s;t enterpri&s;e of the Ru&s;&s;ians. Their va&s;t army retired with di&s;grace, fir&s;t from Branden|burgh, and then from Pomerania; not having been able to ma&s;ter one place of &s;trength in either country; but having de&s;troyed with the mo&s;t &s;avage barbarity in both the open towns and defencele&s;s villages; leaving as &s;trong impre&s;&s;ions of con|tempt
<PB N="59" REF="71">
for the incapacity, as of hor|ror for their cruelty.</P>
<P>After the defeat which the King received at Hohkirchen, he omitted no mea&s;ures to prevent the enemy from making any material advan|tage of it. He perceived clearly, that the advantage they propo&s;ed to derive from it, was to cover the operations of their armies in Sile&s;ia; and that they had no longer any &s;e|rious de&s;ign upon Saxony during this campaign. The King therefore, made no &s;cruple to reinforce his army by con&s;iderable detachments from that of Prince Henry, which were brought up by that Prince him&s;elf. And as he &s;aw that Nei&s;s, the &s;iege of which had been already formed and pro&s;ecuted with great vigour, mu&s;t certainly &s;urrender if it were not &s;peedily &s;uccoured, he re&s;olved to march into Sile&s;ia.</P>
<P>To the execution of this de&s;ign the greate&s;t difficulties &s;tarted up+on all &s;ides. The army of M. Daun lately victorious, had no other bu&s;i|ne&s;s than to intercept him. To fight was dubious; to avoid it hard. If he could even avoid a battle, he had much to apprehend from the efforts of the enemy to hara&s;s him on his march. If he &s;hould be &s;o happy as to e&s;cape or to conquer the&s;e difficulties, yet his march en|tirely uncovered Saxony, and aban|doned that mo&s;t intere&s;ting po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, very poorly defended, to all the force of two powerful armies.</P>
<P>On the other hand, if the con|&s;ideration of Saxony &s;hould detain him in his pre&s;ent &s;ituation, Sile&s;ia ran the &s;ame ri&s;que, and the &s;ame or greater di&s;advantages mu&s;t en&s;ue to his affairs, by &s;uffering the Au&s;|trians to obtain a footing there. This dilemma, which would have rendered a meaner genius entirely inactive, and hindered him from taking any re&s;olution, only obliged the King of Pru&s;&s;ia to take his re|&s;olution with the greater &s;peed, and to execute it with the greater vigour.</P>
<P>On the 24th of November at night he quitted his camp at Do|bre&s;chutz, and making a great com|pa&s;s, he arrived, without any ob|&s;truction from the enemy, in the plain of Gorlitz. A body of the Au&s;trians had in vain endeavoured to &s;ecure this po&s;t before him; tho&s;e that arrived were defeated, with the lo&s;s of eight hundred men. By this happy march, all the advantages of M. Daun's &s;tudied po&s;ition, of all the fruits his boa&s;ted victory at Hohkir|chen, were lo&s;t in a moment, and an open pa&s;&s;age to Sile&s;ia lay before the King. He pur&s;ued his march with the greate&s;t diligence. General Laudohn, with 24,000 men, was &s;ent to pur&s;ue him. That active General continually hara&s;&s;ed his rear Guard; but the King continued his march without interruption, and &s;uffered him to take many little advantages, rather than by delay|ing to conte&s;t &s;mall matters, to en|danger a de&s;ign, which might be de|ci&s;ive of the whole campaign.</P>
<P>On the other hand, Daun, not content with the ob&s;tacles which General Laudohn threw in the King's way, &s;ent a large body of hor&s;e and foot by another rout to reinforce the army which under the Generals Har&s;ch and De Ville had formed the &s;iege of Nei&s;s, and the blockade of Co&s;el. But he per|ceived that all the&s;e mea&s;ures would probably prove ineffectual, as his principal project, which was to co|ver Sile&s;ia, had been defeated. He therefore turned his views towards Saxony and &s;atisfying him&s;elf with detaching General Laudohn, which might create an opinion that the

whole Au&s;trian army pur&s;ued, he followed the king no farther than Gorlitz; which place he immediate|ly quitted, and having by forced marches gained the Elbe, he pa&s;&s;ed that river at Pirna, and ad|vanced <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 6.</NOTE> towards Dre&s;den. At the &s;ame time the army of the Em|pire, by its motions having obliged the Pru&s;&s;ian army then extremely weakened by the detachments that had been drawn from it, to retire from its po&s;t before Dre&s;den, &s;ome miles to the we&s;tward of that city, cut off their communica|tion with Leip&s;ic, whil&s;t M. Daun attempted to cut off their commu|nication with Dre&s;den; but they found means to throw them&s;elves into that city, and afterwards to retire to the other &s;ide of the Elbe. The Au&s;trians and Imperiali&s;ts be|gan at once to inve&s;t tho&s;e two im|portant places; another party ad|vanced towards Torgau, and at|tempted that town. It &s;eemed ut|terly impo&s;&s;ible to prevent the Au&s;|trians from becoming ma&s;ters of Saxony, who in a manner covered the whole country with their forces.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia drew nearer and nearer to Nei&s;s. The &s;iege of that fortre&s;s was commenced on the 4th of Au|gu&s;t; on the 3d of October it was completely inve&s;ted; and the place was pu&s;hed on one &s;ide with the greate&s;t vigour, and on the other maintained with the mo&s;t con&s;um|mate &s;kill and bravery, until the approach of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia obliged the Au&s;trians, on the 1&s;t of November, to rai&s;e the &s;iege, leaving a con&s;iderable quantity of military &s;tores behind them. The &s;ame terror obliged the parties em|ployed in the blockade of Co&s;el, to leave that place at liberty, and to fall back, together with the ar|mies of the Generals Har&s;ch and De Ville, into Bohemia, and the Au&s;trian Sile&s;ia.</P>
<P>The King of Pru&s;&s;ia, when he had thus by the report of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 9.</NOTE> his march, without fighting, driven his enemies out of Sile&s;ia, lo&s;t not a moment to return by the &s;ame route, and with the &s;ame expedi|tion to the relief of Saxony. Two bodies of his troops had moved for the &s;ame purpo&s;e out of Pomera|nia, one under Count Dohna, and one under General Wedel. The corps under Wedel had thrown it&s;elf into Torgau, repul&s;ed the Au&s;trians, who had attempted that place, and pur&s;ued them as far as Eulenburg. The grand operation of the Au&s;trians was again&s;t Dre&s;|den. M. Daun, with an army of 60,000 men, came before that city, on the very day on which the King of Pru&s;&s;ia began his march to op|po&s;e him, &s;o that he might well imagine his &s;ucce&s;s certain again&s;t a place meanly fortified, and de|fended only by 12000 men. The &s;ame day he began to cannonade it, and his light troops, &s;upported by the grenadiers of the army, made a &s;harp attack upon the &s;uburbs. The Governor Count Schmettau &s;aw that from the weakne&s;s of the &s;uburbs it would prove impo&s;&s;ible for him to prevent the enemy from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them&s;elves of them by a <HI>coup de main,</HI> and if they &s;ucceeded in this attempt the great height of the hou&s;es, being &s;ix or &s;even &s;tories, and entirely commanding the ramparts, would render the reduction of the body of the place equally ea&s;y and certain. The&s;e con&s;iderations deter|mined him to &s;et the&s;e &s;uburbs on fire.</P>
<P>It is well known that the &s;uburbs of Dre&s;den compo&s;e one of the &s;ine&s;t towns in Europe, and are
<PB N="61" REF="73">
greatly &s;uperior to that which lies within the walls. Here the mo&s;t wealthy part of the inhabitants re|&s;ide, and here are carried on tho&s;e &s;everal curious manufactures for which Dre&s;den is &s;o famous. Count Daun fore&s;aw this con&s;equence of his attempt. He endeavoured to intimidate the Governor from this mea&s;ure, to which he knew the cruel rea&s;on of war would naturally lead him, by threatening to make him per&s;onally an&s;werable for the &s;teps he &s;hould take; but Count Schmettau an&s;wered with the firm|ne&s;s that became a man of honour and a &s;oldier, that he would an|&s;wer whatever he &s;hould do, and would not only burn the &s;uburbs, in ca&s;e M. Daun advanced, but would likewi&s;e defend the city it|&s;elf &s;treet by &s;treet, and at la&s;t even the ca&s;tle, which was the royal re|&s;idence, if he &s;hould be driven to it. When the magi&s;trates were ap|prized of this re&s;olution, they fell at the feet of Count Schmettau, and implored him to change his mind, and to have mercy on that devoted part of their city. The part of the royal family, who remained in Dre&s;den, joined their &s;upplications to tho&s;e of the magi&s;trates; they prayed him to &s;pare that la&s;t refuge of di&s;tre&s;&s;ed royalty, and to allow at lea&s;t a &s;ecure re&s;idence to tho&s;e, who had been deprived of every thing el&s;e. All entreaties were vain. Schmettau continued firm in his re|&s;olution. He told them that their &s;afety depended on them&s;elves, and on M. Daun; that if he made no attempts, the &s;uburbs &s;hould be &s;till &s;ecure; but that if he took any farther &s;teps, the nece&s;&s;ity of his ma&s;ter's &s;ervice, and his own ho|nour, would compel him to act very di&s;agreeable to the lenity of his di&s;po&s;ition. The Magi&s;trates retired in de&s;pair. Combu&s;tibles were laid in all the hou&s;es.</P>
<P>At three o'clock next morning, the &s;ignal for fir|ing <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 10.</NOTE> the &s;uburbs was given, and in a moment a place &s;o late|ly the &s;eat of ea&s;e and luxury, flouri&s;hing in traffick, in plea&s;ures, and ingenious arts, was all in flames. A calamity &s;o dreadful needs no high colouring. However, as little mi&s;chief attended &s;uch a combu&s;tion, as the nature of the thing could admit. Very few lo&s;t their lives; but many their whole &s;ub&s;tance. When this was done, the Pru&s;&s;ian troops abandoned the flaming &s;uburbs, and retired in good order into the city.</P>
<P>M. Daun &s;aw this fire, which, whil&s;t it laid wa&s;te the capital of his ally, made it more difficult for him to force it, he &s;ent in &s;ome empty threats to the Governor. But the Saxon mini&s;ter at Rati&s;bon, made grievous complaints to the Diet, of what he repre&s;ented as the mo&s;t unparalleled act of wanton and un|provoked cruelty, that had ever been committed. The emi&s;&s;aries of the court of Vienna &s;pread the &s;ame complaints; and they made no &s;cruple to invent, and to alter facts in &s;uch a manner as to move the greate&s;t pity towards the &s;uffer|ers, and the greate&s;t indignation again&s;t the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. All the&s;e, however, were in a &s;hort time abundantly confuted, by the authentick certificates of the ma|gi&s;trates of Dre&s;den, and of tho&s;e officers of the court, who were per|fectly acquainted with the tran&s;ac|tion. By the&s;e certificates it ap|pears, that only two hundred and fifty hou&s;es were con&s;umed. Tho' this was a terrible calamity, it was nothing to the accounts given in the gazettes of the Au&s;trian faction.
<PB N="62" REF="74">
By the&s;e certificates it appears al&s;o, that the people were not &s;urpri&s;ed, but had &s;ufficient notice of the Go|vernor's intentions, to enable them to provide for their &s;afety. In a word, all the charges of cruelty again&s;t the Pru&s;&s;ian commander, and &s;oldiery were fully over|thrown.</P>
<P>This fire made a <HI>coup de main</HI> im|practicable; regular operations de|manded time, and the King of Pru&s;&s;ia was now in full march to|wards Saxony. M. Daun retired from before the place on the 17th. The King after cro&s;&s;ing Lu&s;atia, pa&s;&s;ing the Elbe and joining his troops under Count Dohna and General Wedel, arrived trium|phantly at Drefden on the 20th. The armies of M. Daun and the Empire gave way towards Bohe|mia, into which kingdom they &s;oon after finally retreated, without enterpri&s;ing any thing further. Six &s;ieges were rai&s;ed almo&s;t at the &s;ame time; that of Colberg, car|ried on by General Palmbach, un|der the orders of Mar&s;hal Fermor; that of Nei&s;s, by M: de Har&s;ch; that of Co&s;el; that of Dre&s;den by Mar&s;hal Daun; the blockade of Torgau by M. Haddic; and that of Leip&s;ick by the prince of Deux-Ponts.</P>
<P>About the time that the Au&s;trians retired into winter quarters, the French did the &s;ame; and the Ha|noverians permitted them to do it without mole&s;tation, the &s;ea&s;on be|ing too far advanced, and their army perhaps not of &s;ufficient &s;trength for offen&s;ive operations; and Prince Ferdinand kept the field no longer. The Briti&s;h troops had no occa&s;ion of &s;ignalizing their bravery during this year; but without a battle the nation &s;uffer|ed a very con&s;iderable lo&s;s, and was touched with a very deep and general &s;orrow. The Duke of Marlborough died in Mun&s;ter, the 20th of October, of a fever, con|tracted by the fatigues of the cam|paign. Never did the Nation lo&s;e in one man, a temper more candid and benevolent, manners more a|miable and open, a more primitive integrity, a more exalted genero&s;ity, a more warm and feeling heart. He left all the enjoyments, which an ample fortune and an high rank could be&s;tow in the publick eye; and which every milder virtue, every di&s;po&s;ition to make and to be made happy, could give in a dome&s;|tic life: he left the&s;e for the &s;ervice of his country, and died for its de|fence, as he had lived for its ornament and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>If we compare the events of this year with tho&s;e of the la&s;t, we &s;hall find in the actions of the pre&s;ent year, perhaps &s;omething le&s;s of that a&s;toni&s;hing eclat; fewer battles; not &s;o many nor &s;o &s;triking revolu|tions of fortune; but we may di&s;|cover upon all &s;ides far greater ma|nagement, and a more &s;tudied and refined conduct; more artful move|ments, a more judicious choice of po&s;ts, more quick and vigorous marches. If in the la&s;t year, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia was the hero of the imagination, he is this year the hero of the judgment; and we have, I think, rea&s;on to admire him upon ju&s;ter principles. Obliged to evacuate Moravia, he throws him|&s;elf into Bohemia, and executes a re|treat with all the &s;pirit of an inva&s;ion. He marches more than an hundred miles through an enemy's country, followed and hara&s;&s;ed by large armies, who are unable to obtain any advantage over him. Gaining at length his own territories, he engages the va&s;t army of the Ru&s;|&s;ians
<PB N="63" REF="75">
and defeats it. He is un|able to follow his blow, but he di&s;ables them from &s;triking any blow again&s;t that part of his do|minions, which he is obliged to leave. Whil&s;t he is engaged with the Ru&s;&s;ians on the frontiers of Poland, the Au&s;trians and Imperia|li&s;ts enter Saxony. Before they can do any thing deci&s;ive, the King is him&s;elf &s;uddenly in Saxony, and by his pre&s;ence, at once di&s;con|certs all their projects. The &s;cene is again changed, they &s;urpri&s;e him in his camp at Hohkirchen, two of his Generals are killed, his army defeated, his camp is taken. They attack Sile&s;ia with a formidable army. Notwith&s;tanding his late defeat; notwith&s;tanding the great &s;uperiority of his ene|mies; notwith&s;tanding the advan|tage of their po&s;ts; he makes an amazing &s;weep about all their forces, eludes their vigilance, renders their po&s;itions unprofitable; and march|ing with an a&s;toni&s;hing rapidity into the remote&s;t parts of Sile&s;ia, obliges the Au&s;trian armies to re|tire with precipitation out of that province. Then he flies to the relief of Saxony, which his enemies had again profited of his ab&s;ence to invade; and again by the &s;ame rapid and well conducted march, he obliges them to abandon their prize. Defeated by the Au|&s;trians he acquired by his conduct all the advantages of the mo&s;t compleat victory. He guarded all his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in &s;uch a manner, as to enable them all to endure his ab|&s;ence for &s;ome &s;hort time; and he conducted his marches with &s;uch &s;pirit, as did not make it nece&s;&s;ary to them to hold out any longer; he made twice the circuit of his domi|nions, and in their turn he relieved them all.</P>
<P>Nor was the conduct of Prince Ferdinand of Brun&s;wick le&s;s wor|thy of admiration. Placed at the head of a body of troops, who were but lately obliged to lay down their arms, he found the enemy in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole open country, and of all the &s;trong places in it. Commencing the cam|paign in the mid&s;t of a &s;evere win|ter, without any place of &s;trength in his hands, he drove the enemy from all tho&s;e they held. He obliged them to repa&s;s the Rhine, he followed and defeated them in a pitched battle. Being after|wards obliged by the great force of France on its own frontier, and the numerous armies they had in different places, to repa&s;s the Rhine; he defended Lippe a|gain&s;t numbers greatly &s;uperior, and though they defeated a part of his army, they were not able to turn their victory to the lea&s;t ad|vantage. Prince Ferdinand's cam|paign may well pa&s;s for a perfect mo|del of defen&s;ive operations.</P>
<P>The Au&s;trians, in taking win|ter quarters, di&s;po&s;ed their forces &s;o as to form a chain of an a|mazing length, from the frontiers of Moravia pa&s;&s;ing through Bohemia, all along the &s;kirts of Sile&s;ia and the borders of Saxony. There the Imperial army joined this chain, and continued it through Thuringia and Franconia, where it was united to the quarters of the Prince De Soubi&s;e. The&s;e troops had fallen back from He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el, finding them&s;elves unable to maintain their ground in the landgraviate. The Prince de Soubi&s;e's cantonments extended we&s;tward along the cour&s;e of the Maine and Lahn, to meet tho&s;e of the M. de Contades which &s;tretched to the Rhine, and continued the chain beyond it quite to the
<PB N="64" REF="76">
Mae&s;e, &s;o as to command the whole cour&s;e of the Rhine, on both &s;ides, both upward and downward. Prince Ferdinand was unable to extend him&s;elf to &s;uch a length; and e&s;pecially found it impracti|cable to e&s;tabli&s;h quarters on the other &s;ide of the Rhine; but he di&s;po&s;ed his troops in the mo&s;t ad|vantageous manner in the bi&s;hoprics of Mun&s;ter, Paderborn, and Hilde|&s;heim, and in the landgraviate of He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el. The &s;everal bodies may all unite with ea&s;e, and &s;up|port each other. To pre&s;erve a communication between this and the Pru&s;&s;ian army, as well as to break &s;ome part of that formidable chain of the enemy, the King &s;ent &s;ome bodies of his troops into Thuringia, who di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the army of the Empire of &s;everal of their po&s;ts there, and they now threaten to pe|netrate &s;till farther.</P>
<P>The King of Pru&s;&s;ia, when he had a &s;econd time driven the Au&s;tri|ans and Imperiali&s;ts out of Saxony, re&s;olved to keep no mea&s;ures with that unhappy country. He declar|ed that he was re&s;olved no longer to con&s;ider it as a depo&s;it, but as a country which he had twice &s;ub|dued by his arms. He therefore ordered tho&s;e of the King of Po|land's privy council, who &s;till re|mained at Dre&s;den to retire at a very &s;hort warning. But if the King of Pru&s;&s;ia had a right, as perhaps he had, to con&s;ider Saxony as a lawful conque&s;t, he certainly &s;eem|ed not to con&s;ider the people as &s;ubjects, when he continued to ex|act the mo&s;t &s;evere contributions; and in a manner too very little be|coming a lawful &s;overeign; for he &s;urrounded the exchange with &s;ol|diers, and confining the merchants in narrow lodgings on &s;traw beds, he obliged them by extreme &s;uf|fering, to draw bills on their fo|reign corre&s;pondents for very large &s;ums. This city had been quite exhau&s;ted by former payments, and had not long before &s;uffered mili|tary execution. An enemy that acted thus, had acted &s;everely; but when a country is entirely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by any power, and claim|ed as a conque&s;t, the rights of war &s;eem to cea&s;e; and the people have a claim to be governed in &s;uch a manner as becomes a ju&s;t Prince; e&s;pecially when no extreme nece&s;&s;ity in his affairs compels him to the&s;e rigorous cour&s;es. To re|taliate on the&s;e mi&s;erable people &s;ome part of the cruelties committed by the Ru&s;&s;ians on his dominions &s;eems to be very unrea&s;onable, as it is but too obvious, that the barbarity of that people could not be re|&s;trained, however it might be exa&s;|perated by the total de&s;truction of Saxony. Such retaliations are odious and cruel. We heartily wi&s;h we could prai&s;e the King of Pru&s;&s;ia as much for his temperate u&s;e of his conque&s;t, as for tho&s;e wonderful and heroic qualities by which he obtained it. We might be con|&s;idered as partial in our account, if we had omitted to take notice of what is alledged again&s;t the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, when we have &s;poken &s;o fully of the outrages committed by his enemies. It is now time to turn our eyes from this great theatre to|wards le&s;&s;er events, but &s;uch as will employ us altogether as agreeably; the operations of the Briti&s;h fleets and armies in Europe and America again&s;t the French.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. <HI>The burning of the &s;hips at St. Maloes. Taking of Cherbourg. Defeat at St. Cas. Operations in America. Siege and taking of Loui&s;bourg. Engli&s;h army defeated at Ticonderoga. They take Frontenac. The French aban|don Fort du Que&s;ne. Conclu&s;ion of the annals of the year</HI> 1758.</HEAD>
<P>IN the beginning of this year, the good condition of our navy and our army; the &s;pirit and popularity of the mini&s;try; the wi&s;e choice of commanders, in contempt of vul|gar and trivial maxims; the preva|lence of the contrary to all the&s;e among&s;t the enemy; gave us the be&s;t grounded hopes of a vigorous and &s;ucce&s;sful campaign. Concerning the theatre of our operations there was &s;ome doubt. It was the opinion of &s;ome, that our pu&s;h in Europe &s;hould be made on the &s;ide of Germany; and that we ought to &s;trengthen the army of Prince Fer|dinand with &s;uch a re&s;pectable bo|dy of troops, as might enable that fini&s;hed commander to exert all his talents, and improve to the utmo&s;t the advantages he had already obtain|ed over the French. They imagin|ed, that if an early and con&s;ider|able reinforcement were &s;ent to the Prince, whil&s;t the French army was yet in a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed condition, and if in this condition that &s;hould receive any con&s;iderable blow, they would find it extremely difficult to retrieve it: and receiving this blow, on the frontier of their own territories, the Prince might carry the war into France it&s;elf; and thus very proba|bly bring matters to a &s;peedy deci|&s;ion. That in pur&s;uing this plan a diver&s;ion on the coa&s;t of France was by no means excluded: and that on the contrary it mu&s;t, on this plan, be attended with con&s;equences infinitely more important than it could other|wi&s;e; that otherwi&s;e, France might laugh at the little de&s;ultory efforts of an handful of men, who were to be embarked and di&s;embarked with great difficulty and hazard, and which would always be obliged to fly at the fir&s;t approach of an ene|my. That whil&s;t the French had only an army, greatly inferior in number to engage on the &s;ide of Germany, they would always find them&s;elves well able to act abroad, and defend them&s;elves at home.</P>
<P>On the other hand it was &s;trong|ly urged, that we ought to make the de&s;truction of the French ma|rine our great object, and to con&s;i|der all continental operations only in a &s;econdary light. That in &s;end|ing a large body of Engli&s;h troops to the King's army on the Rhine, we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily weaken our ef|forts in America, and on the coa&s;t of France; and by drawing away all our forces, we mu&s;t &s;hake that internal &s;ecurity, which invigorated all our operations abroad. That whil&s;t we maintained an army of 50,000 foreigners in Germany, it would be the greate&s;t imprudence to &s;end al&s;o a large body of our own national troops into the &s;ame country, and by that means not only &s;quander away our men, but employ almo&s;t every penny granted for the land &s;ervice, out of Great Britain; a method which could not fail of exhau&s;ting us in a very &s;hort time. That the force already in Germany was &s;ufficient to keep the French engaged, and that the propo&s;ed expeditions to France
<PB N="66" REF="78">
would, by attacking the coa&s;t, now in one part, now in another, and keeping all parts in continual alarms, nece&s;&s;arily detain a very con&s;iderable part of their forces at home, and thus make a powerful diver&s;ion, whil&s;t it was pur&s;uing what ought to be the grand perpe|tual object of all our operations, the de&s;truction of the French mari|time power.</P>
<P>The latter opinion prevailed; but it was however &s;o far modified by the arguments on the other &s;ide, that after &s;ome time a few regiments were &s;ent into Germany, as we have before related. The&s;e and better rea&s;ons, no doubt, de|termined the operations on the coa&s;t of France; but whil&s;t the ne|ce&s;&s;ary preparations were making, their de&s;tination was kept an invio|lable &s;ecret; and now, as they had the year before, in&s;pired France with no little terror. Two &s;qua|drons, by the latter end of May, were in readine&s;s for &s;ailing. The greater under Lord An&s;on, the &s;maller under Commodore Howe, which was &s;o de&s;igned to convoy the tran&s;ports, and to favour the landing and reimbarkment. The land forces con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ixteen bat|talions, and nine troops of light hor&s;e: they were commanded by the late Duke of Marlborough.</P>
<P>They &s;ailed from Port&s;|mouth; but as &s;oon as the <NOTE PLACE="marg">June 1.</NOTE> fleet &s;et &s;ail, the &s;quadron of my Lord An&s;on &s;eparated from the re&s;t, and bore off to the Bay of Bi&s;cay, in order to &s;pread the alarm more widely, and to ob&s;erve the French &s;quadron in Bre&s;t. The other part of the fleet, which was commanded by Commodore Howe, with the tran&s;ports, arrived without any ac|cident in Cancalle Bay, at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the city of St. Maloes. Here the troops landed without oppo&s;ition, and having for|tified a po&s;t near Cancalle, <NOTE PLACE="marg">5th.</NOTE> (a po&s;t by nature well fitted for de|fence) for the &s;ecurity of their re|treat, they marched in two columns to St. Maloes. When the army ar|rived there it was &s;oon vi&s;ible, that the town, &s;trongly &s;ituated on a pen|in&s;ula, communicating with the main land only by a long and narrow cau&s;eway, was by no means a pro|per object of a <HI>coup de main;</HI> and though for want of outworks, it was ill qualified to &s;u&s;tain a regular &s;iege; yet our forces were, for want of &s;trength and artillery &s;ufficient, altogether as ill qualified for &s;uch an operation. They were therefore contented with &s;etting fire to about an hundred &s;ail of &s;hipping, many of them privateers, <NOTE PLACE="marg">8th.</NOTE> which lay under the cannon of the town, and to &s;everal magazines filled with naval &s;tores. The da|mage was very con&s;iderable; yet, what is to be remarked, the enemy did not fire a &s;ingle &s;hot on the de|tachment employed in this &s;ervice: Having nothing more to do on this &s;ide, they retired to Cancalle; and reimbarked with as little oppo&s;ition as they met <NOTE PLACE="marg">12th.</NOTE> with at landing; the land and &s;ea commanders having made all the di&s;po&s;itions with great judge|ment.</P>
<P>Before the fleet returned, they reconnoitred the town of Gran|ville on the coa&s;t of Normandy; but finding that a large body of troops were encamped in the neighbourhood, they made no at|tempt there. From thence they moved towards Cherbourg, and made the proper di&s;po&s;itions for landing near that place; but a hard gale blowing in to the &s;hore, and the tran&s;ports beginning to fall
<PB N="67" REF="79">
&s;oul on each other, it became ex|tremely hazardous to attempt land|ing. Be&s;ides, the provi&s;ion was near exhau&s;ted, and the &s;oldiers by being &s;o long cooped up in the tran&s;ports, were grown &s;ickly. It became highly nece&s;&s;ary to return home; and they arrived at St. Helen's on the 29th of June.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s of this expedition, by which the French &s;uffered large|ly, with &s;carce any lo&s;s on our &s;ide, though it &s;ufficiently an&s;wer|ed the intention of the armament, fell &s;omewhat &s;hort of the expec|tations of the public, who had formed much greater hopes, than it was po&s;&s;ible for the nature of &s;uch enterpri&s;es to fulfil. However, their hopes were again revived; by &s;eeing that every thing was pre|pared for another expedition, and that our armies and fleets were to be kept in con&s;tant action dur|ing the &s;ummer. The time was now come when we were to turn the tables upon France, and to retaliate by real attacks, the terrors which had been rai&s;ed by her me|naces of an inva&s;ion. The Duke of Marborough had now taken the command of the Engli&s;h forces in Germany; and General Bligh &s;uc|ceeded him in this command. Prince Edward re&s;olved to go upon the ex|pedition, and to form him&s;elf for the &s;ervice of his country under &s;o brave and able a commander as Howe. It is ea&s;y to imagine, how much the &s;pirit, the pre&s;ence and example of the gallant young Prince, who went with the utmo&s;t chearfulne&s;s through all the detail of a mid&s;hipman's duty, in&s;pired both in the &s;eamen and the troops.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t, the fleet &s;et &s;ail from St. Helen's. In a few days they came to anchor before Cher|bourg. The French had drawn a line &s;trengthened by forts, along the mo&s;t probable places for land|ing. They had drawn down three regiments of regular troops, and a con&s;iderable body of militia to the &s;hore, and had in all appear|ance threatened a very re&s;olute oppo&s;ition to the de&s;cent of the Engli&s;h forces. But the Commo|dore di&s;po&s;ed the men of war and bomb ketches &s;o judiciou&s;ly, and made &s;o &s;harp a fire upon the enemy, that they never ventured out of their entrenchments; &s;o that the landing was ef|fected <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 6.</NOTE> in excellent order, and with very little lo&s;s. The French who made &s;o poor an oppo&s;ition to the landing, had &s;till many ad|vantages from the nature of the ground which they occupied; but they neglected them all; and aban|doning by a mo&s;t &s;hameful de&s;pair their forts and lines on the coa&s;t, they &s;uffered the Engli&s;h to enter Cherbourg the day after the land|ing, without throwing the lea&s;t ob|&s;tacle in their way. It mu&s;t be remembered too, that the whole number of the Engli&s;h forces on this expedition was rather &s;hort of 6000 men.</P>
<P>Cherburg is on the land &s;ide an open town; neither is it very &s;trongly defended towards the &s;ea. The harbour is naturally bad. But the place is well &s;ituated, in the mid&s;t of the channel, for protecting the French, and annoying the Eng|li&s;h commerce in time of war, and perhaps for facilitating an in|va&s;ion on England it&s;elf. Mon&s;ieur Belidor the famous engineer, had demon&s;trated its importance, and propo&s;ed a plan for the improve|ment and defence of the harbour as well as for the fortifications of the town. This plan was approved
<PB N="68" REF="80">
and partly put in execution by the building of a mole, digging a ba&s;on and making &s;luices and flood gates with excellent materials and a va&s;t expence. The work had been for a con&s;iderable time di&s;|continued; but in this expedition, that work of &s;o great ingenuity, charge, and labour, was totally de&s;troyed. Whil&s;t our humanity re|grets the unhappy nece&s;&s;ity of war, we cannot help thinking that the Engli&s;h nation was freed by the &s;ucce&s;s of this expedition, from what might one day be cau&s;e of no trivial alarms.</P>
<P>When this work of dectruction was over, all the ve&s;&s;els in the harbour burned, and ho&s;tages ta|ken for the contributions levied on <NOTE PLACE="marg">16th.</NOTE> the town, the forces reim|barked, with great &s;peed and &s;afety without any interruption from the enemy, and with the &s;ame expedition, care and conduct, as they had been fir&s;t landed; the army having continued ten days unmole&s;t|ed in France.</P>
<P>The nation exulted greatly in this advantage, e&s;pecially as it almo&s;t accompanied the news of our glorious &s;ucce&s;&s;es in America. Nothing was omitted to give the action its utmo&s;t eclat; the bra&s;s cannon and mortars taken at Cher|bourg, were drawn from Ken&s;ing|ton to the tower, quite through the city, in great pomp and or|der, adorned with &s;tream|ers, attended by guards, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 16.</NOTE> drums, mu&s;ic, and whatever el&s;e might draw the attention of the vul|gar. They who cen&s;ured this pro|ce&s;&s;ion as too o&s;tentatious, did not con&s;ider, how forcibly things of this nature &s;trike upon ordinary minds, and how greatly they contri|bute to keep the people in good hu|mour to &s;upport the many charges and lo&s;&s;es that are incident to the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful war.</P>
<P>The fleet when it left Cher|bourg, was driven to the coa&s;t of England; but the troops were not di&s;embarked; it was re&s;olved, that the coa&s;t of France &s;hould have no re&s;pite; and accordingly they &s;ailed towards St. Maloes, and landed in the bay of St. Lunar at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the town of St. Maloes. This choice of a place for landing, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have &s;urpri&s;ed all tho&s;e who remembered upon what rea&s;ons the attempt a|gain&s;t that place had been &s;o re|cently laid a&s;ide. There was no other object of &s;ufficient con&s;ide|ration near it. The town was at lea&s;t in as good a po&s;ture of de|fence as it had been then; and the force which was to attack it had &s;ince then been con&s;iderably le&s;&s;ened. There is undoubtedly &s;omething very unaccountable, as well in the choice as in the whole conduct of this affair. The per|&s;ons in the principal commands, &s;hifted the blame from one to another. There is nothing more remote from our de&s;ign, than to &s;et up for judges in matters of this nature; or ungenerou&s;ly to lean on any officer, who meaning well to the &s;ervice of his country, by &s;ome misfortune or mi&s;take fails in &s;uch hazardous and intricate enterpri&s;es. We &s;hall be &s;atisfied with relating the facts as they hap|pened.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the troops were landed in the bay of St. Lunar, it became evident that the de&s;ign again&s;t St. Maloes was utterly im|practicable. Other projects were then propo&s;ed, but they all &s;eemed equally liable to objection. Whil&s;t they debated concerning a plan for their operations, the fleet was in
<PB N="69" REF="81">
the greate&s;t danger. The bay of St. Lunar is extremely rocky; and the experience of the people of the country, together with what he &s;aw him&s;elf, convinced the Commodore that it was impo&s;&s;ible to remain any longer in this road with tolerable &s;afety. Therefore he moved up to the bay of St. Cas, about three leagues to the we&s;tward.</P>
<P>The fleet was &s;eparated from the land forces; but it was &s;till ea&s;y to pre&s;erve a communication between them; and as no attack was yet apprehended, they made no &s;cruple to penetrate farther in|to the country. In two days they arrived at the village of Matig|non, having had &s;everal &s;kirmi&s;hes with &s;mall bodies of the enemy, who from time to time appeared on their flanks, and who always di&s;appeared when they were bri&s;kly encountered. By this time the Duke d'Aiguillon, Governor of Britanny, was advanced within &s;ix miles of the Engli&s;h army, with a body of twelve battalions and &s;ix &s;quadrons of regular troops, and two regiments of militia. This deter|mined the council of war to re|treat; they wanted but three miles to the bay of St. Cas. But in this little march a con&s;iderable time was con&s;umed, and the French army was clo&s;e upon them before they could be completely reim|barked. A very &s;teep hill formed a &s;ort of amphitheatre about the bay of St. Cas, where the em|barkation was making; but before the la&s;t divi&s;ion, which con&s;i&s;ted of all the grenadiers of the army, and the fir&s;t regiment of guards, could get off, the French had marched down this hill, through an hollow way, and formed them|&s;elves in a long line again&s;t the few Engli&s;h troops that remained. There remained in this exigency only the expedient of a&s;&s;uming a bold coun|tenance, and attacking them with vigour. The bravery of our troops on this de&s;perate occa&s;ion, was wor|thy of a better fortune. The &s;hips and frigates &s;econded their efforts, and made a &s;evere fire upon the enemy. All was to no purpo&s;e; their ammunition was at la&s;t &s;pent; the enemies numbers prevailed; our little body attempted to re|treat, but they fell into confu&s;ion, they broke, an horrible &s;laughter fol|lowed, many ran into the water and met their fate in that element. The &s;hore was covered with dead bodies. General Dury was drown|ed. Sir John Armitage a young vo|lunteer of great fortune and hopes, was &s;hot through the head. Seve|ral officers, men of large fortune and con&s;ideration, fell. At length the firing of the frigates cea&s;ed, and the French immediately gave quarter. About 400 were made pri&s;oners, 600 were killed and wounded.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this carnage, in the mid&s;t of a fire that &s;tag|gered the brave&s;t &s;eamen who ma|naged the boats, Commodore Howe exhibited a noble example of in|trepidity and fortitude, by order|ing him&s;elf to be rowed in his own boat through the thicke&s;t of the fire, to encourage all that were engaged in that &s;ervice, and to bring off as many men as his ve&s;&s;el could carry.</P>
<P>This affair di&s;pirited the people of England, and elated the people of France far more than an affair of &s;o little con&s;equence ought to have done. It was in fact no more than the cutting off a rear guard. There is often more blood&s;hed in &s;kirmi&s;hes in Germany, which make no figure in the Gazettes. And
<PB N="70" REF="82">
certainly, if our expeditions to the coa&s;t of France were planned with any judgment, on our part we had rather rea&s;on to congratulate our|&s;elves that we were able to land three times on that coa&s;t, with &s;o incon|&s;iderable a lo&s;s. The French in|deed had rea&s;on to magnify this lo&s;s; and they did greatly magnify it in order to con&s;ole their people, who had &s;een their trade &s;uffer &s;o much, and their country &s;o long in&s;ulted with impunity.</P>
<P>Whatever our &s;ucce&s;&s;es were on the coa&s;t of France, they did not affect us in the &s;ame manner with tho&s;e which we had in A|merica. From this part of the world we had long been &s;trangers to any thing, but delays, misfor|tunes, di&s;appointments, and di&s;graces. But the &s;pirit which had been rou&s;ed at home, diffu&s;ed it&s;elf into all parts of the world where we had any concern, and invigorated all our operations.</P>
<P>Admiral Bo&s;cawen with a power|ful fleet of men of war and &s;e|veral tran&s;ports &s;ailed for Halifax from England Feb. the 19th. He had the chief command in the ex|pedition again&s;t Loui&s;bourg, and in particular the direction of the na|val operations. General Amher&s;t, from who&s;e character great things were expected, and who ju&s;tified the&s;e expectations, was to com|mand the land forces. The&s;e a|mounted to about 14000 men, in|cluding &s;ome light troops, fitted for the peculiar &s;ervice of the country. The whole fleet con&s;i&s;ting of 151 &s;hips, &s;et &s;ail from the harbour of Halifax. On the &s;econd of June they appeared before Loui&s;bourg. They were &s;ix days on the coa&s;t be|fore a landing was found practicable; &s;uch a prodigious &s;urf &s;welled all along the &s;hore, that no boat could po&s;&s;ibly live near it. The French not tru&s;ting to this ob&s;tacle, had drawn entrenchments in every part where it might be po&s;&s;ible to land, &s;upported them with bat|teries in convenient places, and lined them with numerous in|fantry. At length the &s;urf though violent, at be&s;t, was ob&s;erved to be &s;omewhat abated, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">June 8.</NOTE> the Admiral and General did not lo&s;e a moment to avail them&s;elves of this fir&s;t opportunity of land|ing; they made all their di&s;po|&s;itions for it with the highe&s;t judge|ment. They ordered the frigates towards the enemies right and left, to rake them on their flanks. Then the troops were di&s;po&s;ed for landing in three divi&s;ions. That on the left was commanded by Ge|neral Wolfe, and was de&s;tined to the real attack. The divi&s;ions in the center to the right, were only de&s;igned for feigned attacks, to draw the enemies attention to all parts, and to di&s;tract their defence.</P>
<P>When the fire of the frigates continued about a quarter of an hour, General Wolfe's divi&s;ion moved towards the land; the enemy re&s;erved their &s;hot until the boats were near in &s;hore, and then directed the whole fire of their cannon and mu&s;quetry upon them. The &s;urf aided their fire. Many of the boats over&s;et, many were broke to pieces, the men jumped into the water, &s;ome were killed, &s;ome drowned; the re&s;t &s;up|ported and encouraged in all diffi|culties, by the example, &s;pirit, and conduct of their truly gallant com|mander, gained the &s;hore, took po&s;t, fell upon the enemy with &s;uch order and re&s;olution, that they &s;oon obliged them to fly in confu&s;ion. As &s;oon as this po&s;t was made good, the center moved towards
<PB N="71" REF="83">
the left, and the right followed the center, &s;o that the landing was compleated, though not without much time and trouble, in an ex|cellent order, and with little lo&s;s.</P>
<P>The operations of a &s;iege are too minute and intere&s;ting to make a detail of them agreeable to readers, who are not conver&s;ant in the art military. The operations a|gain&s;t Loui&s;bourg for &s;everal days went on very &s;lowly, owing en|tirely to the prodigious &s;urf and the rough weather which made it extremely difficult to land the ar|tillery, &s;tores, and in&s;truments to be employed in the &s;iege; however, the excellent conduct of the Ge|nerals Amher&s;t and Wolfe, by de|grees overcame all the difficulties of the weather, which was ex|tremely unfavourable, the ground which was rugged in &s;ome places and boggy in others, and the re|&s;i&s;tance of the garri&s;on which was con&s;iderable. The French had five men of war of the line in the harbour, who could bring all their guns to bear upon the approaches of the Engli&s;h troops. The fir&s;t thing done was to &s;ecure a point called the light-hou&s;e battery, from whence they might play upon the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, and on the batteries on the other &s;ide of the harbour. General Wolfe performed this &s;er|vice with his u&s;ual vigour and celeri|ty, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this <NOTE PLACE="marg">12th.</NOTE> and all the other po&s;ts in that quarter. His fire from this po&s;t on the 25th &s;ilenced the i&s;land battery, which was that mo&s;t immediately oppo&s;ed to his; but the &s;hips &s;till continued to bear upon him until the 21&s;t of the following month, when one of them blew up, and communicating the fire to two others, they al&s;o were in a &s;hort time con&s;umed to the water edge. This was a lo&s;s not to be repaired; the approaches drew near the covered way, and things were in a good condition for making a lodgement in it; the enemies fire was con&s;iderably &s;lackened: the town was con&s;umed to the ground in many places, and the works had &s;uffered much in all. Yet the enemy &s;till delaying to &s;urrender, gave occa&s;ion to add one brave action to the others, which had been di&s;played during the cour&s;e of this &s;iege. The ad|miral, who had all along done every thing po&s;&s;ible to &s;econd the efforts of the land forces, notwith|&s;tanding the &s;everity of the weather, re&s;olved on a &s;troke, which by being deci&s;ive of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the harbour, might make the re|duction of the town a matter of little difficulty. He re&s;olved to &s;end in a detachment of 600 &s;ea|men in boats, to take or burn the two &s;hips of the line which remain|ed, and if he &s;hould &s;ucceed in this, he propo&s;ed the next day to &s;end in &s;ome of his own great &s;hips, who might batter the town on the &s;ide of the harbour. This was not more wi&s;ely planned by the Admiral, than gallantly and &s;ucce&s;sfully executed by Captain Laforey. In &s;pite of the fire from the &s;hips and the batteries, he made him&s;elf <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 25.</NOTE> ma&s;ter of both the&s;e &s;hips; one he towed off, the other, as &s;he ran a|ground, was &s;et on fire.</P>
<P>This &s;troke, in &s;upport of the &s;pi|rited advances of the land forces, was conclu&s;ive The <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 26.</NOTE> town &s;urrendered the next day. The garri&s;on were pri&s;oners of war, and amounted with the irregulars and &s;eamen to 5637.</P>

The taking of Loui&s;bourg was an event the mo&s;t de&s;ired by all our colonies; that harbour had always been a receptacle convenient to the enemies privateers, who infe&s;ted the Engli&s;h trade in North America. It was the mo&s;t effectual blow which France had received from the commencement of the war. By the taking of Loui&s;bourg, &s;he lo&s;t the only place from whence &s;he could carry on the cod fi&s;hery; and the only place &s;he had in a convenient &s;ituation for the rein|forcements that were &s;ent to &s;up|port the war in the other parts of America; and with Loui&s;bourg fell the i&s;land of St. John's, and whatever other inferior &s;tations they had for carrying on the fi&s;h|ery towards Ga&s;pe&s;ie and the bay De Chaleurs, which our &s;hips &s;oon after this event entirely de&s;troyed. It is incredible how much this &s;ucce&s;s in America, joined to the &s;pirit of our other mea&s;ures, ope|rated to rai&s;e our military reputa|tion in Europe, and to &s;ink that of France, and con&s;equently how much it influenced our mo&s;t e&s;|&s;ential intere&s;ts and tho&s;e of our allies.</P>
<P>The plan of our operations in America were, however, by no means confined &s;olely to this ob|ject, important as it was. Two other attempts were propo&s;ed: the fir&s;t attempt was with a great force to drive the French from Ticonde|roga and Crown Point; in which, if we could &s;ucceed, the enemy would lo&s;e tho&s;e po&s;ts from which they were in the be&s;t condition to mole&s;t our colonies, and by lo&s;ing them, would lay open an ea&s;y road into the very heart of their &s;ettlements in Canada. The &s;econd attempt was to be made with a con&s;iderable, though an inferior force, from Pen&s;ylvania again&s;t Fort du Que&s;ne: The &s;uc|ce&s;s of this attempt would e&s;tabli&s;h us in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Ohio, and break off the connexion between Canada and Loui&s;iana.</P>
<P>General Abercrombie, command|er in chief of our forces in America, conducted the fir&s;t of tho&s;e expe|ditions. He embarked upon Lake George with near 16000 troops, regulars and provincials, and a nu|merous artillery on the 5th of July; and after a pro&s;perous navi|gation, arrived the next day at the place where it had been propo&s;ed to make the landing. They landed without oppo&s;ition. The enemies advanced guards fled at their ap|proach. The Engli&s;h army pro|ceeded in four columns to Ticon|deroga. As the country through which their march lay is difficult and woody, and the guides which conducted the march to this un|known country, were extremely un&s;kilful, the troops were bewilder|ed, the columns broke and fell in upon one another. Whil&s;t they marched on in this alarming di&s;|order, the advanced guard of the French, who had lately fled before them, was bewildered in the &s;ame manner; and in the &s;ame di&s;order fell in with our forces. A &s;kir|mi&s;h en&s;ued, in which this party was quickly defeated with the lo&s;s of near 300 killed and 148 pri|&s;oners. The lo&s;s on the Engli&s;h &s;ide was incon&s;iderable in numbers; but great in con&s;equence. Lord Howe was killed. This gallant man, from the moment he landed in America, had wi&s;ely conformed and made his regiment conform to the kind of &s;ervice which the country required. He did not &s;uf|fer any under him to encumber them&s;elves with &s;uperfluous bag|gage;

he him&s;elf &s;et the example, and fared like a common &s;oldier. The fir&s;t to encounter danger, to endure hunger, to &s;upport fatigue; rigid in his di&s;cipline, but ea&s;y in his manners, his officers and &s;ol|diers readily obeyed the com|mander, becau&s;e they loved the man; and now at the moment when &s;uch abilities, and &s;uch an example were the mo&s;t wanted, was fatally lo&s;t a life which was long enough for his honour but not for his country.

<P>Excepting this lo&s;s, the army had hitherto proceeded &s;ucce&s;sfully. In a little time they appeared before Ticonderoga. This is a ve|ry <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 8.</NOTE> important po&s;t, and as &s;trongly &s;ecured. The fort is &s;itu|ated on a tongue of land between Lake George and a narrow gut, which communicates with the Lake Champlain. On three &s;ides it is &s;urrounded with water; and for a good part of the fourth it has a dangerous mora&s;s in front; where that failed, the French had made a very &s;trong line upwards of eight feet high, defended by cannon, and &s;ecured by 4 or 5000 men. A great fall of trees with their branches outward, was &s;pread before the entrenchment for about an hundred yards.</P>
<P>The General cau&s;ed the ground to be reconnoitred; and the en|gineer made &s;o favourable a report of the weakne&s;s of the retrench|ment, that it appeared practicable to force it by mu&s;quetry alone. A fatal re&s;olution was taken, in con&s;equence of this report, not to wait the arrival of the artillery, which on account of the badne&s;s of the ground, could not be ea&s;ily brought up, but to attack the enemy without lo&s;s of time. They were confirmed in this precipitate re&s;olution, by a rumour that a body of 3000 men were on their march to join the French at Ticonderoga, and very &s;hortly expected to arrive.</P>
<P>When the attack began, the difficulty of the ground and the &s;trength of the enemies lines which had been &s;o little fore&s;een, was but too &s;everely felt. Although the troops behaved with the utmo&s;t &s;pirit and gallantry, they &s;uf|fered &s;o terribly in their approaches, and made &s;o little impre&s;&s;ion on the entrenchment, that the Gene|ral &s;eeing their reiterated and ob|&s;tinate efforts fail of &s;ucce&s;s, being

upwards of four hours expo&s;ed to a mo&s;t terrible fire, thought it nece&s;&s;ary to order a retreat, to &s;ave the remains of the army. Near 2000 of our men were killed, wounded and taken pri&s;oners; the number of the taken being very incon&s;iderable. This precipitat eat|tack, was followed by a retreat as precipitate; in&s;omuch that our army gained their former camp to the &s;outhward of Lake <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 9.</NOTE> George, the evening after the action.</P>
<P>To repair the misfortune of this bloody defeat, General Aber|crombie detached Colonel Brad|&s;treet with about 3000 provincials again&s;t Fort Frontenac. The Co|lonel with great prudence and vigour, &s;urmounting great diffi|culties, brought his army to O&s;|wego, where he embarked on the Lake Ontario, and arrived at Frontenac the 25th of Augu&s;t. This fort &s;tands at the commu|nication of Lake Ontario with the river St. Lawrence, the entrance into which river it in &s;ome manner commands. However, for a po&s;t of &s;uch moment, it was poorly fortified, and poorly garri&s;oned. It was taken without the lo&s;s of a man on our &s;ide, in le&s;s <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 27.</NOTE> than two days after it had been attacked. The garri&s;on con|&s;i&s;ting of 130 men were made pri|&s;oners; nine armed &s;loops were taken and burned; and a large quantity of provi&s;ions ama&s;&s;ed there for the u&s;e of their garri&s;ons to the &s;outhward, was de&s;troyed. The Fort was demoli&s;hed. Colonel Brad&s;treet having performed this important &s;ervice, returned. Many were of opinion, that &s;o fine a po&s;t ought to have been kept and &s;trongly garri&s;oned; others thought that it would be impo&s;&s;ible to pre|&s;erve a place at &s;uch a di&s;tance from our own e&s;tabli&s;hments.</P>
<P>It is very po&s;&s;ible, that the &s;uc|ce&s;s of Colonel Brad&s;treet greatly facilitated that of the expedition under General Forbes. The Ge|neral had had a very tedious and trouble&s;ome march, through a coun|try almo&s;t impracticable, very little known, and continually hara&s;&s;ed on his route by the enemies In|dians. An advanced guard of this army, con&s;i&s;ting of about 800 men under Major Grant, had mo&s;t unaccountably advanced clo&s;e to Fort du Que&s;ne, with a de&s;ign as it &s;hould &s;eem of reduc|ing the place by a <HI>coup de main;</HI> but the garri&s;on &s;uddenly &s;allying out and attacking them warmly on all &s;ides, killed and made pri|&s;oners many of this party, and di&s;per&s;ed the re&s;t. This was how|ever their la&s;t &s;ucce&s;s; for the body of the army being conducted with greater &s;kill and circum&s;pec|tion, baffled all their attempts; &s;o that the French being convinc|ed by &s;everal &s;kirmi&s;hes that all their efforts to &s;urprize the troops, or interrupt their communication were to no purpo&s;e, and being con&s;cious that their fort was not tenable again&s;t a regular attack, they wi&s;ely abandoned the place after de&s;troying their <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 24.</NOTE> works; and fell down the Ohio, to the number of 4 or 500 men, towards their more &s;outhern &s;ettle|ments. General Forbes once more erected the Engli&s;h flag on Fort du Que&s;ne. Without <NOTE PLACE="marg">25th.</NOTE> any re&s;i&s;tance we became ma&s;ters in the third year after the com|mencement of ho&s;tilities of that fortre&s;s, the contention for which had kindled up the flames of &s;o general and de&s;tructive a war. This place with its ma&s;ters has changed
<PB N="75" REF="87">
its name, and is called Pitt&s;burg, with a propriety which does not need to be pointed out.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the unhappy affair at Ticonderoga, the cam|paign of 1758 in America was very advantageous, and very ho|nourable to the Engli&s;h intere&s;t. Loui&s;bourg, St. John's, Frontenac, and du Que&s;ne reduced, remove from our colonies all terror of the Indian incur&s;ions, draw from the French tho&s;e u&s;eful allies, free our frontiers from the yoke of their enemies forts, make their &s;upplies difficult, their communications pre|carious, and all their defen&s;ive or offen&s;ive operations uneffective; whil&s;t their country uncovered of its principal bulwarks, lies open to the heart, and affords the mo&s;t plea|&s;ing pro&s;pects of &s;ucce&s;s to the vigo|rous mea&s;ures which we may be a&s;|&s;ured will be taken in the next cam|paign. General Amher&s;t is now commander.</P>
<P>It would be doing great inju|&s;tice to the &s;pirit and conduct of the mini&s;try, not to ob&s;erve, that they omitted to di&s;tre&s;s the enemy in no part, and that their plans of operation were as exten&s;ive as they were vigorous.</P>
<P>Two &s;hips of the line with &s;ome frigates, were <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 9.</NOTE> &s;ent early in the &s;pring to the coa&s;t of Africa, to drive the French from their &s;ettlements there. They en|tered the river Senegal, and in &s;pite of the ob&s;truction of a dan|gerous bar, which the &s;hips of war could not pa&s;s, they obliged the French fort <NOTE PLACE="marg">May 1.</NOTE> which commands the river to &s;ur|render. And on the 29th of De|cember following, Commodore Kep|pel, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome troops under the command of Lieu|tenant-Colonel Worge, made him|&s;elf ma&s;ter of the i&s;land of Goree and its forts; the garri&s;on &s;urren|dering at di&s;cretion to his Maje&s;ty's &s;quadron. By the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es, we have taken from the enemy one of the mo&s;t valuable branches of their commerce, and one of the mo&s;t capable of abundant improve|ment <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The river Senga, or Senegal, is one of tho&s;e channels of the river Niger, by which it is &s;uppo&s;ed to di&s;charge its waters into the Atlantic ocean: The river Niger, according to the be&s;t maps, ri&s;es in the ea&s;t of Africa; and after a cour&s;e of 300 miles, nearly due we&s;t, divides into three branches, the mo&s;t northerly of which is the Senegal, as above; the middle is the Gambia, or Gambra; and the mo&s;t &s;outhern Rio Grande. Senegal empties it&s;elf into the Atlantic ocean in 16&deg; north lat. The entrance of it is guarded by &s;everal forts, the principal of which is Fort Lewis, built on an i&s;land of the &s;ame name. It is a quadrangular fort, with two ba&s;tions, and of no incon&s;iderable &s;trength. At the mouth of the river is a bar; the be&s;t &s;ea&s;on for pa&s;&s;ing it, is from March to Augu&s;t, or September, or rather from April to July, becau&s;e the tides are then highe&s;t. The Engli&s;h had formerly &s;ettlements here, out of which they were driven by the French, who have engro&s;&s;ed the whole trade from Cape Blanco to the river Gambia, which is near 500 miles. The Dutch were the fir&s;t who &s;ettled Senegal, and built two forts. The French made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of them in 1678. In 1692 the Engli&s;h &s;eized them; but next year the French retook them, and have kept them ever &s;ince. They built Fort Lewis in 1692, and have beyond it a multitude of other &s;ettlements, extending 200 leagues up the river. The principal commodities which the French import from this &s;ettlement are, that valu|able article gum &s;enega, hides, bees-wax, elephants teeth, cotton, gold du&s;t, negro &s;laves, o&s;trich feathers, ambergris, indigo, and civet.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent we are obliged to buy all our gum &s;enega of the Dutch, who purcha&s;e it from the French; and they &s;et what price they plea&s;e on it. But as the trade to Africa is now open, by this important acqui&s;ition, the price of this valuable drug, which is &s;o much u&s;ed in &s;everal of our manufactures, will be much reduced.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="88">
From the Ea&s;t Indies we have this year heard nothing remarkable. It does not &s;eem that the French, notwith&s;tanding the great &s;truggle they made to &s;end out a &s;trong ar|mament under General Lally, have been in a condition to enterpri&s;e any thing. It is &s;aid, and proba|bly with good foundation, that the greate&s;t part of that force was dwindled away with &s;ickne&s;s during the voyage. Our naval force was exerted with &s;pirit and effect in the Mediterreanean. The French found that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mi|norca could not drive us from the dominion of the Mediterranean, where Admiral O&s;born gave the enemies maritime &s;trength &s;uch blows, as they mu&s;t long feel, and which merited him the greate&s;t of all honours, to be joined with the conquerors of Loui&s;bourg, in the thanks of the repre&s;entative body of their country.</P>
<P>The coming year &s;eems big with great events. In Germany the af|fairs of the rival powers of Pru&s;&s;ia and Au&s;tria, appear to be more nearly ballanced than at any time &s;ince the beginning of the war. Their force is as great as ever, and their animo&s;ity is no way le&s;|&s;ened. Great &s;teps are taken to a&s;|&s;emble powerful armies on the Rhine; whil&s;t Great Britain has &s;ent out two con&s;iderable armaments, one to the We&s;t Indies, the other to A|frica; the &s;ucce&s;s of which mu&s;t go a great way towards determining the i&s;&s;ue of the war. Other great preparations are al&s;o making on the part of Great Britain. In the mean time, the Dutch enraged at the captures of their &s;hips, make com|plaints, and threaten armaments. The death of the Prince&s;s of O|range, which happened at a mo&s;t critical juncture, adds more per|plexity to affairs in that quarter. If we look to the &s;outhward, the clouds &s;eem gathering there al&s;o. The imminent death of the King of Spain, will be an event fruitful of troubles. In this affair the King of Sardinia, the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, and the hou&s;e of Bourbon, will find them&s;elves concerned; to &s;ay nothing of the maritime powers. In a word, the flame of war threatens to &s;pread in every part of Europe.</P>

<P>WHOEVER reflects up|on the conclu&s;ion of the &s;everal campaigns &s;ince the year 1755, will ea&s;ily perceive that at the end of the la&s;t, the fortune of the &s;everal powers at war &s;eem|ed more nearly upon a ballance, than it had been at the clo&s;e of any of the former. That campaign was rather le&s;s bloody, than that which immediately preceded it; and it was not concluded with any action of &s;uch an eclat, as could greatly rai&s;e, or depre&s;s the hopes of any of the contending parties. All par|ties became more cautious; becau&s;e it became every day more evident, that the fortune of war was not to be decided by any &s;ingle &s;troke, however con&s;iderable. The prize was re&s;erved for the player of the &s;kilful game; for the mo&s;t attentive patience: for the greate&s;t depth of re&s;ources. An equality of this kind &s;eemed at la&s;t to promi&s;e Eu|rope &s;ome repo&s;e. All &s;ides might now give and receive honourable and equitable terms; and peace
<PB N="78" REF="90">
might be &s;ettled on that footing, on which it has been u&s;ually made, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, in our part of the world. But the great de&s;igns entertained by each power; re|venge imbittered by the blows which all had felt in their turns, the con&s;ideration of the va&s;t ex|pences that fell upon all, and which a peace at that time would have made fruitle&s;s; even the hopes a|ri&s;ing from the equivocal appear|ances of the la&s;t campaign, e&s;tranged every court from the di&s;po&s;ition to peace. In&s;omuch that there were no terms directly offered by any of the belligerent powers; nor did any of the neutral interpo&s;e their mediation. Be&s;ides the&s;e, another cau&s;e operated powerfully; a great event was hourly expected about this time; an event which threatned to involve the Southern parts of Europe in the calamities of that war, that had &s;o long wa&s;ted the Northern; and which, whenever it &s;hould take place, threatned to render the politi|cal &s;y&s;tem infinitely more intricate, and probably to give the war quite a new turn.</P>
<P>The late King of Spain, by the force of a conjugal affection, rarely &s;een in that dignity, &s;ince the death of his Queen had been given up to a melancholy, which preyed upon his health and affected his under&s;tand|ing. His death, or incapacity, ap|peated inevitable within a &s;hort time. The King of Naples, Don Carlos, was next in the order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. In the treaty of Aix la Chapelle. it had been agreed, that the dutchies of Parma. Placentia and Gua&s;talla, &s;hould be re&s;tored to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, in ca&s;e Don Carlos &s;hould ever come to the crown of Spain. The&s;e countries were at the end of that war, in the hands of the Empre&s;s Queen, or her allies. Her imperial Maje&s;ty had &s;et up a claim to the re|ver&s;ion of the&s;e dutchies, on the extinction of i&s;&s;ue male in the hou&s;e of Farne&s;e. But the ambition of the Queen of Spain to make all her children Sovereigns, put powerful bars in her way to it. This ambi|tion was one of the cau&s;es which made the la&s;t &s;o general a war. The peace of Aix la Chapelle, which put a period to that war, after &s;ettling the&s;e conte&s;ted dutchies as an e&s;ta|bli&s;hment for Don Philip &s;econd &s;on to the King of Spain, provided, that whenever the event, which we have mentioned above, &s;hould take place, that is to &s;ay, the acce&s;&s;ion of Don Carlos to the crown of Spain, then the Kingdom of Naples and Sicily &s;hould pa&s;s to the In|fant Don Philip, and the dutchies which formed his e&s;tabli&s;hment &s;hould revert to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria.</P>
<P>The King of Naples, not with|out rea&s;on, looked upon this article of the treaty of Aix la Chapelle, as injurious to his rights; accordingly he never acceded to it. No method in this ca&s;e could be &s;een, which might prevent matters from com|ing to extremities, except the &s;itua|tion of the Empre&s;s, engaged as &s;he was with a powerful adver&s;ary, who kept her forces &s;trained to their utmo&s;t pitch. She was in no condition to engage in a new war, however intere&s;ting the object might be. Her ally France, who &s;o inef|fectually a&s;&s;i&s;ted her in Germany, could not probably a&s;&s;i&s;t her with more effect in Italy; &s;he therefore &s;eemed to have no other part left, than to acquie&s;ce for the pre&s;ent, and wait in &s;ilence a more favoura|ble opportunity to a&s;&s;ert her claims. The event of the King of Spain's death has &s;ince happened. It has
<PB N="79" REF="91">
produced none of tho&s;e immediate effects which were apprehended; and this probably proceeded from the cau&s;e which we have ju&s;t now hinted. A dead calm at pre&s;ent broods over Italy. But in this tranquillity and &s;ilence there are materials gathering, which may on no very di&s;tant period bur&s;t in a terrible tempe&s;t over that delight|ful country. They are very near|ly the &s;ame that produced the la&s;t troubles there, and may not only revive them, but &s;pread the horrors of war once more over all Europe.</P>
<P>Such were the inclinations of the powers at war at the opening of this year; their &s;trength &s;eemed al&s;o very entire; in particular, the re&s;ources of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia ap|peared a&s;toni&s;hing, after the great blows he had &s;uffered; and after the advantages he had gained, but gained at &s;o high a price. He was &s;till able to &s;hew him&s;elf the father and benefactor, as well as the pro|tector of his people. In the mid&s;t of the devouring wa&s;te of &s;uch an expen&s;ive war, from the funds of his oeconomy he was enabled to remit the taxes to tho&s;e parts of his dominions, which had &s;uffer|ed from the Ru&s;&s;ian barbarity; he even advanced money to tho&s;e which had &s;uffered the mo&s;t con&s;i|derably.</P>
<P>To take a nearer view of his &s;ituation, we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the whole kingdom of Pru&s;&s;ia &s;till re|mained in the hands of the Mu&s;|covites. The dutchy of Cleves, together with his other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions on the Rhine, could yield him nothing; they were held by the French; but in the&s;e re&s;pects, his &s;ituation was not wor&s;e than it had been, almo&s;t from the beginning of the war. He had to ballance the&s;e lo&s;&s;es, the rich country of Saxony, which he had twice in one campaign wre&s;ted from the hands of the Au&s;trians. Add to this, the renewal of the &s;ub&s;idy treaty with Great Britain, on the advantageous terms of the former year. The&s;e were undoubtedly great &s;upports; and the King &s;eemed as entire in power, and more advanced in repu|tation than ever.</P>
<P>But to a more critical examina|tion, things had an a&s;pect not quite &s;o favourable. This appearance was rather &s;pecious than entirely &s;olid; and whil&s;t all without looked full and fair, within there was a decay of &s;ub&s;tance, and an hol|lowne&s;s that rung at the &s;lighte&s;t touch. That incomparable body of troops, which at the beginning of the war had given him &s;o great a &s;uperiority, no longer exi&s;ted in the &s;ame per&s;ons. If his troops derived advantages from a long &s;eries of ac|tive &s;ervice, the&s;e advantages were equally on the &s;ide of the enemy. His army had known what it is to be beaten; and it is no wonder, if a &s;ort of wearine&s;s and de&s;pair be|gan to creep upon them, after &s;uch an infinite train of unrewarded fa|tigues, when they &s;aw that &s;o many wonderful exploits had not yet end|ed the war in their favour. Many of his be&s;t generals had been killed in battle, or died, or had retired, or were di&s;graced. The hoards which he had ama&s;&s;ed before the war, by this time mu&s;t have been entirely &s;pent; his dominions mu&s;t have been greatly exhau&s;ted, both of men and money. Saxony could no longer yield &s;uch &s;upplies, as formerly. The indigence of the &s;ubdued inhabitants, &s;et bounds to the rapacity of the conqueror. The &s;ub&s;idy of Great Britain did a great deal; but it could not &s;up|ply the deficiencies on this, and on
<PB N="80" REF="92">
every other &s;ide. The&s;e circum|&s;tances, probably, made the King of Pru&s;&s;ia more cautious and dilatory than u&s;ual.</P>
<P>The court of Vienna had as great burthens to &s;u&s;tain as the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, and &s;he had &s;uffer|ed much greater blows. That pow|er has a &s;trength, &s;omewhat unac|countable and peculiar to her&s;elf. More deficient in pecuniary funds, than any other great power in Eu|rope, &s;he is better able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and to do con&s;iderable things with|out them. For by a long habit, the whole &s;tate is formed to its ne|ce&s;&s;ities; and the &s;ubject is more ready to &s;upply free quarter, and to endure military licence than any other. The country is abundantly fruitful in all its parts. And whil&s;t the war is carried on near home, an arbitrary government, operating on &s;o exten&s;ive an object, can hardly fail of &s;uch re&s;ources, as mu&s;t &s;erve an Au&s;trian army; which is &s;till paid, in a great mea&s;ure, as Tacitus de&s;cribes the troops of the ancient Germans to have been; <HI>they have a plentiful table in lieu of pay.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Nam epulae, et quanquam incompti, largi tamen apparatus pro &s;tipendio cedunt.</HI> Tacit. de moribus Germ. &sect;. 14.</NOTE></P>
<P>And indeed it mu&s;t be owned, that there is no Sovereign, who is more highly honoured in his domi|nions, or obeyed with a greater mixture of love and reverence, by all his &s;ubjects, than her Imperial Maje&s;ty. So that having a very am|ple power, very willing obedience, a large territory and many men, not &s;ufficiently employed in the arts of peace, it perhaps may be gue&s;|&s;ed, in what manner &s;he has been able to &s;upply her many and great lo&s;&s;es, and to continue a war, like the pre&s;ent, better than &s;tates more abundant in money. She is be&s;ides, and this is a matter of no &s;mall con|&s;equence, &s;upported by the coun|tenance, the authority, and the forces of the Empire. And &s;he has for her allies the fir&s;t, and mo&s;t formidable names in Euorpe. In the wars which this power carried on in the la&s;t, and in this century, though u&s;ually not very &s;ucce&s;sful, &s;he has always been the la&s;t to de|&s;ire a peace; though frequently &s;low in her operations, &s;he makes amends by an extraordinary per|&s;everance.</P>
<P>This &s;lowne&s;s could not e&s;cape general ob&s;ervation, in the actions of the la&s;t year. That the Au&s;trians did not play with &s;ufficient &s;pirit, the great game which was in their hands, after the battle of Hohkir|chen and the entry of the Ru&s;&s;ians into the New Marche of Branden|burgh, &s;eems hardly di&s;putable. Per|haps it was that the court of Vienna, by an error common to many courts, but particularly &s;o to this, and often fatal to it, interfered too much and too minutely, in the operations of the campaign.</P>
<P>It is not impo&s;&s;ible that the cha|racter of Mar&s;hal Dawn him&s;elf, might have had &s;ome &s;hare in this inactivity; a character almo&s;t in all things the direct rever&s;e of that of his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty. He &s;aw that the King, active, re&s;olute and ad|venturous, wa&s;ted him&s;elf even by that activity and &s;pirit, to which he owed his mo&s;t brilliant &s;ucce&s;&s;es. Should the Au&s;trians carry on the war in the &s;ame &s;pirit, they might &s;uffer in the &s;ame manner, without being ever able to equal, much le&s;s to exceed that great Monarch, in a &s;tile of action peculiarly his own. Daun therefore by principle, &s;eems to have kept his army from coming to action, in order to oppo&s;e a &s;trength entire, and recruited by a long re&s;t, to that of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, wa&s;ted by the efforts it was obliged to make, ince&s;&s;antly and on
<PB N="81" REF="93">
every &s;ide. His de&s;ign &s;eemed to be, that the i&s;&s;ue of the war &s;hould rather ari&s;e from the general re&s;ult and concurrence of all the opera|tions, gradually producing a &s;olid though a &s;low advantage, than from the effect of a bold, quick, and ma&s;terly &s;troke. In fact, the Au&s;|trians felt all the benefits, and all the inconveniencies which u&s;ually attend this &s;ort of conduct, a con|duct which probably lo&s;t them Sax|ony in the la&s;t campaign, and which has &s;ecured them the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what they now hold in that country. The Au&s;trians and Pru&s;&s;ians watched the time and one another, and came very late to action.</P>
<P>The court of Peter&s;burg &s;till ad|hered to its old &s;y&s;tem, in &s;pite of the late ill &s;ucce&s;s of her arms, and all the efforts of the Briti&s;h mini&s;|ter, to withdraw her from her al|liance. If &s;he had &s;ome lo&s;s of men, it was the lea&s;t lo&s;s &s;he could feel: and &s;he thought that whil&s;t the war was carried on at the expence of o|thers, the reduction of &s;o near, &s;o dreaded, and &s;o hated a rival as the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, and the opportu|nity of the forming her troops to &s;ervice, and perfecting her officers, were objects of con&s;equence enough to keep her clo&s;ely attached to her fir&s;t &s;entiments.</P>
<P>The Swedes pre&s;erved likewi&s;e the &s;ame connexion; but they continued as before, an incon&s;iderable, and in|glorious part of the war.</P>
<P>Holland pre&s;erved her neutrali|ty; but it was a neutrality little re&s;pected, and indeed in it&s;elf lit|tle re&s;pectable. Divided in her councils, attentive only to private intere&s;ts, &s;he di&s;gu&s;ted the Engli&s;h, and neither plea&s;ed nor &s;erved the French. For &s;ome of the &s;ubjects of that republic had carried on the trade of France in their bottoms, which &s;ubjected them to frequent captures from the Engli&s;h men of war and privateers. This produced loud complaints in Holland, and warm remon&s;trances to the court of London. The&s;e complaints met with little attention, being in many re&s;pects but indifferently founded. The affair was drawn out in length, until the di&s;pute was ex|tingui&s;hed by the de&s;truction of its object; &s;ome of the French colonies were reduced, and the trade in the others, grown too &s;mall and too ha|zardous to be continued longer with any hope of advantage.</P>
<P>The affairs of France and Eng|land were partly connected with the general &s;y&s;tem, and partly di|&s;tinct and independent. France perceived that the &s;trength of the Engli&s;h, and the exertion of that &s;trength, increa&s;ed continually in America; &s;he knew from the na|tural inferiority of her colonies, and the feeble &s;tate of her navy, that &s;he could not in rea&s;on hope for great &s;ucce&s;s in that quarter; for which rea&s;on, although &s;he &s;ent a fleet under Mon&s;. Bompart into the We&s;t Indies, and &s;ome men of war, with as many &s;tore and tran&s;port &s;hips as &s;he could &s;teal out of the river St. Lawrence, her great efforts were to be made in Europe; &s;he had two objects, the recovery of Hanover, and the inva&s;ion of the&s;e i&s;lands; in either of which if &s;he &s;ucceeded, there could be no doubt, but that it would prove a &s;ufficient ballance for all that &s;he had &s;uffered, or had to apprehend in any other part of the world.</P>
<P>With regard to the fir&s;t object, though it was difficult to attain it, and though if it &s;hould be attained, it did not promi&s;e to an&s;wer her purpo&s;es &s;o well as the latter, yet it was upon that &s;he chiefly depended.

Hitherto indeed the &s;ucce&s;s which France had in Germany, was not at all proportioned to the prodigious efforts which &s;he made; &s;he began to find her&s;elf much exhau&s;ted. The wants of the French obliged them to pay little re&s;pect to neutral, or even to friendly powers; &s;o that the e&s;teem and a&s;&s;i&s;tance which they had in Germany, dimini&s;hed con|tinually. They eat up the country, and &s;eized on &s;uch towns as were convenient to them, without any cere|mony: yet freed from all the&s;e re|&s;traints, their army had made very little progre&s;s; their generals had not di&s;played any great abilities, and their army, in it&s;elf very badly compo&s;ed, was deficient in di&s;cipline, to a degree which is &s;carcely credible. They kept neither guards nor po&s;ts, nor centinels; a great part of their troops wandered from the camp into the neighbouring towns, and returned drunk. Their councils of war were held in a tu|multuous and di&s;orderly manner; and all their de&s;igns were perfectly known in the camp of the allies, where a very different picture was exhibited, with regard to regularity and caution.</P>
<P>The French troops have &s;everal e&s;&s;ential defects in their con&s;titution, which prevent them from equalling tho&s;e of Germany, and other nations. Several regiments are in a manner he|reditary in great families, who placed at their fir&s;t out&s;et at a very high point of military rank, think it un|nece&s;&s;ary to attain the qualifications, which lead others to it &s;tep by &s;tep. As to the re&s;t of the officers, as their pay is &s;mall and their hopes little, few &s;tudy the art military, as a pro|fe&s;&s;ion: they &s;erve becau&s;e it is the fa&s;hion to do &s;o, and that it is thought nece&s;&s;ary to a gentleman. Thus they di&s;patch their bu&s;ine&s;s as a di&s;|agreeable ta&s;k; and having little to lo&s;e in the &s;ervice, it is almo&s;t im|po&s;&s;ible to pre&s;erve a due &s;ubordina|tion. The common men are little more than abject va&s;&s;als, and there|fore want that high &s;pirit which in their gentry makes &s;ome amends for the want of knowledge and a&s;&s;i|duity. And as they are corrupted by the example of their &s;uperiors, &s;o by their negligence they are left without any re&s;traint. The officers do not chu&s;e to incur the ill will of their men, or to give them&s;elves trouble, by exerci&s;ing that whol&s;ome &s;everity in which the health and vi|gour of military di&s;cipline con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P>The German common people are indeed in a &s;till lower &s;tate of va&s;&s;al|age than the French, and might therefore be &s;uppo&s;ed naturally, no better &s;oldiers; but their bodies are more robu&s;t and hardy; their treat|ment is &s;evere and rigorous, their &s;ubordination is mo&s;t exact, which makes their di&s;cipline perfect; and Germany is &s;o habituated to war, that all the people may be &s;aid to be born &s;oldiers. The&s;e things give the Germans a great &s;uperiority over the French; a &s;uperiority which was more vi&s;ible in this, than in any for|mer war.</P>
<P>The&s;e defects in their army were increa&s;ed by the low &s;tate of their finances, which cau&s;ed their troops to be very ill paid. The French court made &s;ome attempts to keep up their credit, by changing their former methods of rai&s;ing money. Mr. Silhoute was made comptroller of the finances, and the farmers general were removed from their former employment of finding the &s;upplies. New methods were devi&s;ed, which might &s;tave off the entire ruin of their finances, until their armies in Germany could &s;trike &s;ome effec|tive blow, or their project of an in|va&s;ion, which quieted the minds of
<PB N="83" REF="95">
the people in &s;ome degree, &s;hould be put in execution.</P>
<P>With regard to the latter project, France had formerly found that the bare report of &s;uch a de&s;ign had &s;erved many material purpo&s;es; but in England things had &s;ince then, been greatly changed. The threats of an inva&s;ion increa&s;ed our internal &s;trength, without rai&s;ing any apprehen&s;ions; they in a great mea&s;ure executed the militia act, which hardly any thing el&s;e could have put in execution; they in|crea&s;ed the regular troops, both in their number and their &s;pecies. England for the fir&s;t time &s;aw light hor&s;e and light foot. There reign|ed in both hou&s;es the mo&s;t per|fect and unprecedented union. A|mong the great men there was no difference that could in the lea&s;t af|fect the conduct of the war. The di&s;pute concerning the preference of the continental and the marine &s;y&s;tem, was entirely &s;ilenced; be|cau&s;e a &s;y&s;tem took place which comprehended both, and operated in both as fully as the warme&s;t ad|vocates of either could de&s;ire. Ne|ver did England keep a greater number of land forces on foot, on the continent of Europe, in Eng|land, in America, when &s;he turned all her power to her land forces on|ly. Never did &s;he cover the &s;eas with &s;uch formidable fleets, when her navy alone engaged her atten|tion. Such is the effect when pow|er and patrioti&s;m unite; when <HI>li|berty and order ki&s;s;</HI> and when a nation &s;its with a happy &s;ecurity un|der the &s;hade of abilities which &s;he has tried, and virtues in which &s;he dares to con&s;ide.</P>

<P>THE &s;eizing of Francfort in the la&s;t year, by a mo&s;t fla|grant violation of the liberties of the Empire, had given the French and their allies the mo&s;t material ad|vantage they had acquired in the campaign; for it &s;ecured to them the cour&s;e of the Maine, and the Rhine, and made it ea&s;y to them to receive every kind of reinforcement and &s;upply. It &s;ecured likewi&s;e that communication between them, the Imperial, and the Au&s;trian armies, and formed that chain, from which they derived no &s;mall benefit of mutual &s;uccour and concurrence in their operations. Much depended upon their being di&s;lodged from that po&s;t; as well with regard to the fortune of his Britannic Maje&s;ty's army, as to that of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. Such a &s;troke mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily have the greate&s;t influence on the events of the whole en&s;uing campaign. Prince Ferdinand, &s;en|&s;ible of this, as &s;oon as the &s;ea&s;on permitted him to enter upon action, drew his troops out of their canton|ments; and at the head of thirty thou&s;and men, prepared to di&s;lodge them, before they could receive the &s;upplies, of which they were in daily expectation. The re&s;t of his army, con&s;i&s;ting of about ten or twelve thou&s;and men, were left to guard the electorate, and to watch the bi&s;hoprick of Mun&s;ter. Some detachments of Hanoverians and Pru&s;&s;ians had, in the latter end of February, driven the Imperiali&s;ts
<PB N="84" REF="96">
and Au&s;trians from the po&s;ts, which they occupied at Erfurth and Ei&s;i|nach, and &s;ome places in the coun|try of He&s;&s;e; this drew a &s;trong body of the enemy into that part, which pu&s;hed them back; but the hereditary Prince of Brun&s;wick, who led the army of the allies through ways, before deemed im|pa&s;&s;able to an army, defeated them in &s;ome &s;evere &s;kirmi&s;hes; &s;everal places of importance were taken; &s;everal' whole battalions were made pri&s;oners, with their officers. The French, alarmed at the vivacity of this beginning, judged it but the prelude to &s;omething more deci&s;ive. Accordingly the Duke of Broglio took an advantageous po&s;t, near Bergen, at a village between Franc|fort and Hannau, which it was nece&s;&s;ary that the allies &s;hould ma&s;|ter, before they could penetrate to his line. This place he had made his right, and &s;ecured his flanks and center in &s;uch a manner, that the attack could only be made at that village.</P>
<P>In this di&s;po&s;ition was the French army when the allies approached; they formed them&s;elves under an emi|nence, and began the attack on the vil|lage of Bergen, between nine and ten in the morning with great intrepidity. They were received with a very &s;e|vere fire, which the enemy had pre|pared for them; they made three at|tacks in the &s;pace of about two hours, and were every time repul&s;ed.</P>
<P>Prince Ferdinand now ob&s;erved that the enemy &s;till kept a good countenance in their po&s;t, and that his own troops began to fall into &s;ome di&s;order. This able general, who never ri&s;ques his fortune on a &s;ingle throw, began to think of a retreat, whil&s;t his lo&s;s was yet in|con&s;iderable, and the di&s;order of his men ea&s;ily to be repaired. But a retreat in the face of a victorious enemy, was hazardous; and the day was not yet above half &s;pent. In this exigence he made &s;uch movements, as &s;trongly indicated a de&s;ign of falling once more upon the village, in the enemy's right, and of making at the &s;ame time a new attack upon their left. The&s;e appearances were farther counte|nanced by a cannonade, on both the&s;e po&s;ts, &s;upported with an un|common fury. The French, de|ceived by the&s;e manoeuvres, kept clo&s;e in their po&s;ts; they expected a new and a lively attack every moment; they returned the can|nonade as bri&s;kly as they could; and in this po&s;ture things continu|ed until night came on, when the Prince made an ea&s;y retreat, with|out di&s;order, or mole&s;tation, and halted at Windeken.</P>
<P>In this action the lo&s;s of the allies was about two thou&s;and in every way; that of the French was by no means le&s;s con&s;iderable. The allies indeed &s;uffered nothing in their reputation; their countenance through the whole action having been excellent. Prince Ferdinand gained as much honour, and di&s;|played as much &s;kill, as could have been obtained, or &s;hewn upon a more fortunate occa&s;ion. The event however was, in its con&s;equences, far from indifferent; for the allies having mi&s;&s;ed this blow, the French &s;till kept Francfort, and all advan|tages which they drew from that &s;ituation; they had time and means to receive their reinforcements; and they acquired in a &s;hort &s;pace &s;uch a &s;uperiority, as obliged Prince Fer|dinand to content him&s;elf with act|ing on the defen&s;ive, for a long time after.</P>
<P>The advantages which would have
<PB N="85" REF="97">
a ri&s;en from another i&s;&s;ue of that bat|tle appeared more fully, from the operations which were carrying on on the &s;ide of Bohemia, and which probably were de&s;igned to concur with tho&s;e of the Prince, in &s;ome grand and comprehen&s;ive &s;cheme. There is no doubt, that the army of the allies, and tho&s;e of his Pru&s;|&s;ian Maje&s;ty, had determined to act in concert, and had &s;ettled &s;ome plan for that purpo&s;e: and though it &s;hould not be di&s;covered with equal certainty, what that plan was, it may not however be unplea&s;ant to trace it; as far at lea&s;t, as a rea&s;onable conjecture, guided by the lights de|rived from the tendency of each ope|ration, may lead us. For if we &s;uc|ceed at all, in &s;uch an attempt, it diffu&s;es a wonderful clearne&s;s over the whole narrative.</P>
<P>It is not impo&s;&s;ible then, that it was de&s;igned in the fir&s;t place, to keep the Ru&s;&s;ians at a di&s;tance, un|til the latter end of the &s;ummer, by the de&s;truction of their magazines in Poland. That on the other &s;ide Prince Ferdinand &s;hould attempt to drive the French towards the Rhine, and to get between them and the army of the empire; which having thus lo&s;t its communication with the French, Prince Henry &s;hould ru&s;h out of Saxony, and fall upon them in Bohemia and Franconia, and cut off al&s;o their communication with the great body of the Au&s;trians. Then the Imperiali&s;ts would find them&s;elves &s;ituated between two ho&s;tile and &s;uperior armies; whil&s;t in Bohemia, Mar&s;hal Daun would be either obliged to try his fortune &s;ingle handed, with the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, or totally to abandon that kingdom, into which it was in the power of the Pru&s;&s;ians to enter, in oppo&s;ite parts at once.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t part of this plan was executed with great &s;pirit and &s;uc|ce&s;s. So early as the 23rd of Fe|bruary the Pru&s;&s;ian general Wo|ber&s;now marched into Poland, from Glogau in Sile&s;ia, with forty-&s;ix &s;quadrons, and twenty-nine batta|lions, where they routed &s;ome bo|dies of Co&s;&s;acks; and after having de&s;troyed &s;everal immen&s;e maga|zines, particularly one at Po&s;en, &s;aid to be &s;ufficient for the &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence of fifty thou&s;and men for three months, they returned without any lo&s;s into Sile&s;ia, on the 18th of April.</P>
<P>As for the &s;econd Act of this mi|litary drama, it was executed with as great &s;ucce&s;s, and with &s;ome ad|vantages more &s;triking than the fir&s;t. Prince Henry commanded the Pru&s;|&s;ian troops in Saxony, which the public accounts called forty thou|&s;and men. He had certain intelli|gence, that &s;ome movements, which had purpo&s;ely been made by the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, had drawn the greate&s;t part of the Au&s;trian troops, which had been po&s;ted as a watch upon Saxony, towards the frontiers of Sile&s;ia. He immediately took ad|vantage of this opening, and entered Bohemia in two columns: one marched towards Peter&s;|wade; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ap. 15.</NOTE> the other, which was com|manded by General Hul&s;en, made its way by Pa&s;berg and Commot|tau. The fir&s;t penetrated as far as Lobo&s;chutz and Leitmeritz, the en|emy flying before them, and every where abandoning or burning the va&s;t magazines which they had a|ma&s;&s;ed in all tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>The body under General Hul&s;en did as much &s;ervice, and it had a more active employment. The pa&s;s of Pa&s;berg, &s;trong in it &s;elf, was defended by a con&s;iderable body of Au&s;trians. General Hul&s;en having conducted his cavalry by ano|ther way, &s;o as to fall directly on their
<PB N="86" REF="98">
rear attacked them with his infan|try in front, and drove them out of all their intrenchments; one gene|ral, fifty one officers, and no le&s;s than two thou&s;and private men, were made pri&s;oners on this occa|&s;ion. The Pru&s;&s;ians lo&s;t but &s;eventy men killed and wounded. They re|turned into Saxony with ho&s;tages for the contributi|ons <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ap 22.</NOTE> they had exacted.</P>
<P>After this fatiguing expedition, the Prince gave his troops a few days to re&s;t, and then led them once more to action. He directed his march through the Voigtland, towards the army of the Empire; they entered Franconia by the way of Hoff; they attacked General Macguire, who commanded a body of Au&s;trians and Imperiali&s;ts. Here they were bravely re&s;i&s;ted for the whole day; but the numbers and &s;pirit of the Pru&s;&s;ians prevailing, Macguire gladly took advantage of the night to make a retreat, having lo&s;t about five hundred men. A few &s;kirmi&s;hes more decided the fate of Franconia. The army of the Em|pire retreated, as the Pru&s;&s;ians ad|vanced, and abandoned the rich bi&s;hoprics of Bamberg and Wurtz|burg to contribution. The town of Bamberg &s;urrender|ed upon terms; but <NOTE PLACE="marg">May 16.</NOTE> &s;ome confu&s;ion happening before the capitulation was compleatly fini&s;hed, a party of Croats came to blows with a party of Pru&s;&s;ians, who had by this time po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one of the gates; this was re&s;ented as an infringement of the capitulation. A pretence was given to plunder the place; it was given up to pillage, by order of the commanders, for two days, in a very unrelenting and licentious manner. This produced loud and ju&s;t complaints again&s;t the Pru&s;&s;ians, and in due time a &s;evere retaliation.</P>
<P>Prince Henry had pu&s;hed back the army of the Empire, as far as Nuremberg; he had di&s;abled a great part of the circle of Fran|conia from giving them a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and thus far he had accompli&s;hed the objects of his expedition. But as that part of the plan, which Prince Ferdinand was to have ex|ecuted, had failed, it was impo&s;|&s;ible on one hand to hinder the French army from &s;uccouring that of the Empire, or on the other, to prevent a body of Au&s;trians from availing them&s;elves of his ab&s;ence, to penetrate into Saxony. In the&s;e circum&s;tances any farther &s;tay in Franconia was u&s;ele&s;s, and might be dangerous. His army, loaded with booty and contribution, re|turned to their old &s;ituation. The Au&s;trians retired into Bohemia at their approach.</P>
<P>Appearances were hitherto favour|able enough to the Pru&s;&s;ians; how|ever none of the great ends propo|&s;ed by the general plan were fully an&s;wered. The Ru&s;&s;ians, notwith|&s;tanding the de&s;truction of their ma|gazines, continued their march to|wards Sile&s;ia. Count Dohna, who had rai&s;ed great contributions and levies in the dutchy of Mecklenburg, was preparing to oppo&s;e them on the &s;ide of Brandenburgh; other parties under other commanders, were po&s;t|ed at tho&s;e places where their irrup|tion was the mo&s;t apprehended. The approach of this army brought things nearer and nearer to a cri&s;is. The eyes of all Europe were fixed with anxiety and expectation on their progre&s;s. It appeared the more formidable, becau&s;e the pro|gre&s;s of the French arms was very rapid after the battle of Bergen.</P>
<P>Prince Ferdinand finding that another attack was not advi&s;eable, retreated continually. The French
<PB N="87" REF="99">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of He&s;&s;e with|out oppo&s;ition; they met as little in making their way through the bi&s;hopric of Paderborn; and whil&s;t their grand army, under Mar&s;hal de Contades, pu&s;hed the allies in that quarter and on the &s;ide of He&s;&s;e, M. d'Armentieres was po&s;ted by We|&s;el, to advance on that &s;ide as oc|ca&s;ion &s;hould require. The condi|tion of the allied army was ex|tremely dubious; whil&s;t the French increa&s;ed in their numbers and &s;pi|rit. Their new &s;ucce&s;s gave them rea&s;on to hope for a campaign as for|tunate as that of 1757.</P>

<P>GREAT Britain was not con|tent with the efforts which &s;he had made in Germany: America, the intere&s;ts of which had given ri&s;e to the war, was the object which principally engaged her attention. This was indeed the proper object of her natural &s;trength, and by her &s;uc|ce&s;s in this quarter, &s;he mo&s;t effectu|ally laid the ax to the root of the enemy's naval power, and cut away one great part of the re&s;ources which fed the war. A &s;quadron of nine &s;hips of the line, with &s;ixty tran&s;|ports, containing &s;ix regiments <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 1758.</NOTE> of foot, in the end of the la&s;t year, &s;ailed for the We&s;t Indies, in or|der to attack and reduce the French Caribbee i&s;lands. General Hop&s;on commanded the land forces; the fleet in the expedition was to be under the orders of Commodore Moore, then in the We&s;t Indies.</P>
<P>Their fir&s;t object was Martinico, the fir&s;t in reputation of the French Caribbees, the &s;eat of government, the center of all the trade which France carries on with tho&s;e i&s;lands; &s;trong both by nature and art. This i&s;land lies in the 15th degree N. lat. The &s;hore is on every &s;ide indented with very deep bays, which they call Cul de Sacs, and the &s;ands, only di&s;|coverable at low water, form in ma|ny places a hidden, and almo&s;t in|&s;urmountable barrier. A lofty ridge of almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able mountains, runs north we&s;t and &s;outh ea&s;t quite through the i&s;land; all the &s;pace on both &s;ides is inter&s;ected at incon&s;i|derable di&s;tances with deep gullies, through which the water pours down in the rainy &s;ea&s;ons, with great impetuo&s;ity. In other re|&s;pects, the i&s;land is plea&s;ant and fruitful; well watered, and well cul|tivated, abounding with plantations and villages all along the &s;ea coa&s;t. The two principal places are St. Pierre, and Port Royal; both towns con&s;iderable in this part of the world, for their magnitude, trade and &s;trength.</P>
<P>By this &s;hort de&s;cription may be di&s;cerned, how de&s;irable &s;uch a conque&s;t was, and the difficulties which naturally oppo&s;ed them&s;elves to it. They were the greater, becau&s;e at this time there was in the i&s;land a con&s;iderable number of regular troops. They have at all times a numerous and well armed militia, not contemp|tible for their di&s;cipline, and
<PB N="88" REF="100">
well &s;uited to the &s;ervice of the country; add to this, that they can bring into the field a large body of negroes, habituated to arms, and in general well affected to the intere&s;ts of their ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h forces landed with|out oppo&s;ition, on the we&s;t &s;ide of Port Royal <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 6.</NOTE> harbour, after the men of war had driven the enemy from their bat|teries and entrenchments. But on their landing, they found that the nature of the country proved a greater ob&s;truction to their progre&s;s, than the &s;trength of the enemy. The&s;e profound gullies, inclo&s;ed by &s;teep, and almo&s;t perpendicular precipices, proved an un&s;urmount|able ob&s;tacle to the regular march of the troops, or the conveyance of cannon. The enemy had broken up the roads; and five miles of &s;uch roads, and through &s;uch an im|practicable country, were to be pa&s;|&s;ed, before Port Royal could be at|tacked by land. The commander, therefore, of the forces, judged the difficulties on the land-&s;ide in&s;ur|mountable; the naval commander held it impo&s;&s;ible to put the cannon a&s;hore nearer to the &s;ort. Some jea|lou&s;y &s;eems to have ari&s;en. The re|&s;ult of the whole was, that the forces were reimbarked on the day of their landing.</P>
<P>Very little was done at Port Roy|al; but it was hoped, that more would be done at St. Pierre. They accordingly &s;et &s;ail for that place; but when they had arrived before it, and examined the coa&s;t, new difficulties aro&s;e, which <NOTE PLACE="marg">19.</NOTE> produced a new deliberation. They determined that the fort could not be reduced, without &s;uch detriment to the troops and the &s;hipping, that they could afterwards make little u&s;e of their &s;ucce&s;s; and in this they had probably good rea&s;on. The conduct of the officers afterwards plainly demon&s;trated, that no mean views had any influence on their councils; they agreed to abandon their enterprize again&s;t Martinico. But having been foiled in this their fir&s;t attempt, they re&s;olved not to return with the di&s;grace of having done nothing worthy of the great|ne&s;s of the armament, and the ex|pectation of their country. They con&s;idered, that the i&s;land of Gua|daloupe was an object, though not of &s;uch an eclat, of full as much real con&s;equence as Martinico; and they knew, that it was neither &s;o &s;trong in troops or fortifications. Their fir&s;t failure might lead to an advantage, as con&s;iderable as that which they had mi&s;&s;ed. In pur&s;u|ance of the&s;e re&s;olutions, they &s;et &s;ail for Guadaloupe.</P>
<P>This i&s;land is called Guadaloupe, from a re&s;emblance which it bears to a chain of mountains of the &s;ame name in Old Spain. To &s;peak with exactne&s;s, Guadaloupe is rather to be con&s;idered as two i&s;lands, divided from each other by a &s;mall arm of the &s;ea, or &s;alt-wa|ter river, not above three hundred feet over where it is wide&s;t. One of the&s;e i&s;lands is called the Grand Terre; the other more particularly and by di&s;tinction, Guadaloupe; they are together in circuit about ninety leagues. The fir&s;t is nearly de&s;titute of fre&s;h water, and not perfectly cultivated; but it is other|wi&s;e with Guadaloupe. No part of the world is furni&s;hed with more or better. No le&s;s than fifty rivers, in that &s;mall circuit, throw them&s;elves into the &s;ea; many navigable by boats, for two, &s;ome even for three leagues into the country. Not to
<PB N="89" REF="101">
mention the numberle&s;s &s;prings which ri&s;e among the rocks, and, after a thou&s;and beautiful meanders, lo&s;e them&s;elves in the larger &s;treams. The fir&s;t accounts which we have of that country, are lavi&s;h in the de|&s;cription of its beauties; and the late&s;t agree with them, that no part of the We&s;t Indies, perhaps of the world, affords more agreeable and romantic &s;cenes. It is full of high mountains; one of which towers far above the re&s;t, and is a volcano, continually emitting &s;moke and fire. From hence they have con&s;iderable quantities of &s;ulphur. They have al&s;o hot baths, fit for all the medi|cinal purpo&s;es in which &s;uch wa|ters are u&s;ed. The land in the valleys is extremely fertile; it pro|duces the u&s;ual We&s;t India commo|dities, &s;ugar, indigo, coffee, cotton, and ginger: the mountains abound with game: &s;o that there is nothing in the i&s;land wanting, for the con|venience and delight of life, in an air more temperate and &s;alubrious than is commonly breathed between the tropics.</P>
<P>The French began to plant colo|nies in this i&s;land as early as the year 1632. But for a long time this, together with all their other colo|nies, continued in a langui&s;hing con|dition. It was in the beginning of the pre&s;ent century, that they be|gan to emerge. After the peace of Utrecht had given France time to breathe, &s;he turned her attention &s;trongly to the&s;e i&s;lands; Guada|loupe partook however le&s;s of this care than Martinico; and yet, by its natural advantages, it does not fall &s;hort of that i&s;land, either in the quantity, or the goodne&s;s of its produce; if it does not greatly ex|ceed it in both; as it certainly does in its capacity to receive all &s;orts of improvement. The importance of this i&s;land, until its late conque&s;t, was very little known in England. The rea&s;on was this. By an old regulation, the people of Guada|loupe were forbid to trade directly with Europe, but were obliged to &s;end all their produce to Martinico, from whence al&s;o they had all their European commodities. A &s;trange regulation, to be continued in an age &s;o enlightened as this, by a nation &s;o enlightened as France.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h made attempts upon this i&s;land in 1691, and 1703; but they were neither powerful enough, nor conducted with &s;ufficient abi|lity to produce any permanent ef|fect; the troops wa&s;ted the country, and retired with their booty. But on the occa&s;ion, of which we are going to &s;peak, they were more able, &s;trong, and fortunate.</P>
<P>On the 23d of January the fleet came before the town of Ba&s;&s;e Terre, the capital of the i&s;land; a place of con&s;iderable extent, large trade, and defended by a &s;trong fortre&s;s. This fortre&s;s, in the opinion of the chief engineer, was not to be redu|ced by the &s;hipping. But Commo|dore Moore, notwith&s;tanding this opinion, brought four men of war to bear upon the citadel; the re&s;t were di&s;po&s;ed again&s;t the town, and the batteries which ob&s;tructed the landing. About nine in the morn|ing a fire from all &s;ides began, which continued with the utmo&s;t fury un|til night, when the citadel, and all the batteries, were effectually &s;ilen|ced. During this cannonade the bombs, that were continually &s;how|ered upon the town, &s;et it on fire in &s;everal places. It burned without interruption the whole of this and the following day; when it was al|mo&s;t totally reduced to a&s;hes. The lo&s;s was prodigious from the num|ber of warehou&s;es in the town, full of rich, but combu&s;tible materials. Nothing could be more &s;triking,
<PB N="90" REF="102">
than the horror of the &s;pectacle, from the mutual and unremitted fire of &s;o many great &s;hips and batteries, heightened with a long line of flames, which extended a|long the &s;hore, and formed the back ground of this terrible picture.</P>
<P>In this lively engagement, our lo&s;s was very incon&s;iderable. The next day the forces landed with|out oppo&s;ition, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 24.</NOTE> citadel. Notwith&s;tanding this &s;uc|ce&s;s, the i&s;land was far from being reduced. The country is rugged and mountainous, and abounded with pa&s;&s;es and defiles, of a difficult and dangerous nature. The inha|bitants had retired with their armed negroes into the mountains; and all &s;eemed prepared to defend their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions bravely, and to the la&s;t extremities.</P>
<P>General Hop&s;on died on the 27th of February, and General Barrington &s;ucceeded him. He em|barked part of his forces for the Grand Terre, where Colonel Crump attacked and reduced the towns of St. Anne, and St. Francois; whil&s;t this attack diverted the enemy's at|tention, the General fell upon the &s;trong po&s;t of Go&s;ier, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of it; and thus the Grand Terre was in a manner reduced, and di&s;abled from &s;ending any relief to the other part.</P>
<P>There is a con&s;iderable moun|tain, not far from the town of Ba&s;&s;e Terre, called Dos d'A&s;ne, or the A&s;&s;es' Back; thither a great part of the enemy had retired. It is a po&s;t of great &s;trength, and great importance, as it keeps a watch upon the town, and at the &s;ame time forms the only communication there is between that town, and the Capes Terre, the plaine&s;t, plea&s;ante&s;t, and mo&s;t fruitful part of the whole i&s;land. It was not judged practicable to break into it by this way; and all the re&s;t of Guadaloupe was in the enemy's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Therefore a plan was formed for another operation, by which it was propo&s;ed to &s;urprize Petit Boutg, Goyave, and St. Ma|ry's, and by that way to march into Capes Terre, which might be ea&s;i|ly reduced. But this de&s;ign failing, it was nece&s;&s;ary to attempt tho&s;e places by plain force. Col. Clave|ring and Col. Crump landed near Arnonville, and attacked the ene|my, &s;trongly intrenched at a po&s;t, &s;trong by nature, called Le Corne. This was forced; another intrench|ment at Petit Bourg had the &s;ame fate; a third near St. Mary's yield|ed in the &s;ame manner. An open|ing being at la&s;t made into the Capes Terre, the inhabitants &s;aw, that the be&s;t part of the country was on the point of being given up to fire and &s;word; they came in and capitulated; their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and their civil and religious liber|berties were granted to them. <NOTE PLACE="marg">May 1.</NOTE></P>
<P>Three &s;mall i&s;lands, near Guada|loupe, De&s;eada, Santos and Pe|tite Terre, &s;urrendered a few <NOTE PLACE="marg">9th.</NOTE> days after, and on the &s;ame terms.</P>
<P>This capitulation was hardly &s;ign|ed, when the French &s;quadron un|der M. Bompart appeared before the i&s;land, and landed at St. Anne's, in the Grand Terre, the General of the French Caribbees, with &s;ix hundred regular troops, two thou|&s;and buccaneers, and a large quan|tity of arms and ammunition. The capitulation was made at the mo&s;t critical time; for had this reinforce|ment arrived but a day &s;ooner, the whole expedition had probably been lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Thus came into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Great Britain, this valuable i&s;land, after a campaign of near three
<PB N="91" REF="103">
months, in which the Engli&s;h troops behaved with a firmne&s;s, courage and per&s;everance, that ought never to be forgotten. Intolerable heat, continual fatigue, the air of an un|accu&s;tomed climate, a country full of lofty mountains and &s;teep preci|pices, po&s;ts &s;trong by nature and by art, defended by men who fought for every thing that was dear to them; all the&s;e difficulties only increa&s;ed the ardour of our forces, who thought nothing impo&s;&s;ible under commanders, who were not more di&s;tingui&s;hed for their intre|pidity and &s;kill, than their zeal for the &s;ervice of their country, and the perfect harmony and good un|der&s;tanding that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them. There is nothing perhaps &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to in&s;pire confidence into the &s;oldier, as to ob&s;erve that the of|ficers have a perfect confidence in one another.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t not be omitted, that many of the inhabitants exerted them|&s;elves very gallantly in the defence of their country. A woman, a con|&s;iderable planter in the i&s;land, parti|cularly di&s;tingui&s;hed her&s;elf; &s;he was called <HI>Madam Ducharmey:</HI> this a|mazon put her&s;elf at the head of her &s;ervants and &s;laves, and acquitted her&s;elf in a manner not inferior to the brave&s;t men.</P>
<P>Soon after the reduction of Guadaloupe, the i&s;land <NOTE PLACE="marg">May 26.</NOTE> of Marigalante &s;urrendered it&s;elf upon terms &s;imilar to tho&s;e which were granted to the former i&s;land. This is a &s;mall place, but the conque&s;t is of con&s;equence, as the French by this are left no foot|ing in the Leeward i&s;lands: Mar|tinico is one of tho&s;e to the wind|ward. The&s;e beginnings were hap|py omens to the &s;ucce&s;s of the more important undertaking, which was to be carried on in another part of America. The reputation of our arms there, except in the reduction of Loui&s;bourg, had hitherto not been very great. But other com|manders were now appointed, and other maxims prevailed. However, we po&s;tpone the narrative of the&s;e very intere&s;ting events, to con&s;ider tho&s;e which intervened on the con|tinent of Europe, in which too we are to &s;ee our arms no le&s;s di&s;tin|gui&s;hed; and to behold England emerging from the rubbi&s;h of low principles and timid conduct, once more become the pride and terror of Europe, and acting in a manner not unworthy the mo&s;t illu&s;trious periods of her hi&s;tory.</P>

<P>WE left the army of Prince Ferdinand upon the retreat, ever &s;ince the battle of Bergen. The French advanced with great vivaci|ty; their light troops made incur|&s;ions almo&s;t to the gates of Ha|nover. The Prince &s;till continued to retire, but he left garri&s;ons in Lip&s;tadt, Ritberg, Mun&s;ter and Minden, in order to retard the
<PB N="92" REF="104">
enemy's progre&s;s: their principal de&s;ign &s;eemed to be to cut off his retreat to the We&s;er, to which he kept very clo&s;e, as he knew the in|finite con&s;equence of that commu|nication. However, if the enemy failed to compa&s;s that object, all the precautions of the Prince prov|ed al&s;o ineffectual to retard the pro|gre&s;s of their arms. Ritberg was &s;urpri&s;ed, Lip&s;tadt was blockaded, Minden, was taken by a&s;&s;ault, where a garri&s;on of 1500 men were made pri&s;oners, and where immen&s;e ma|gazines fell into their hands. D' Armentieres advanced again&s;t Mun|&s;ter; he attempted to take the place by a coup de main. Though foiled in this attempt with con&s;i|derable lo&s;s, he did not de&s;i&s;t; he drew up his cannon from We&s;el, and after a &s;hort <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 25.</NOTE> &s;iege, made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the city; the garri&s;on of 4000 men became his pri&s;oners. Nothing &s;eemed able to with&s;tand the ra|pid torrent with which the French over-ran the whole country; they no longer hoped, the conque&s;t of Hanover; it was with them an ab|&s;olute certainty. Elated with the fair appearance of their fortune, they kept no bounds The French mini|&s;ter, the Duke of Bellei&s;le, in his letters to the Mar&s;hal Contades, &s;peaks only of the means of &s;ecuring their con|que&s;t, and preventing another ex|pul&s;ion from Hanover; and for this end propo&s;ed the mo&s;t cruel and un|warrantable expedients. Nor was there le&s;s dread and dejection vi&s;ible on the &s;ide of the allies, than pride and confidence on that of the French. The archives and mo&s;t valuable moveables were &s;ent off from Hano|ver to Stade. All things &s;eemed ha&s;tening to the &s;ame po&s;ture which drew on the famous capitulation of Clo&s;ter Seven.</P>
<P>In this general gloom that over|&s;pread the fortune of the allies, the Prince kept him&s;elf unmoved and attentive to his de&s;igns. He did not &s;uffer him&s;elf to be di&s;concerted by blows, which he had probably fore|&s;een, and the ill con&s;equences of which he knew how to prevent. The body of the French army after the taking of Minden, had po&s;ted them&s;elves near that city, to which the right of their army extended; their left was protected by a very &s;teep hill; in their front was a large mora&s;s; and a rivulet covered their rear. Nothing could be more ad|vantageous than this &s;ituation; and whil&s;t they continued in it, nothing could be enterprized again&s;t them. The army of the allies after a con|tinued retreat, began at la&s;t to ad|vance, and fixed their camp altoge|ther as advantageou&s;ly at Peter&s;ha|gen, a place about three leagues from the enemy.</P>
<P>Things were brought to that pa&s;s, that nothing but a battle could hinder the French from taking winter quarters in the electorate. There was no po&s;&s;ibility of at|tacking them with any hope of &s;ucce&s;s in the camp which they then occupied. The point was to draw them from that po&s;t into the plain; but the movements ne|ce&s;&s;ary to effect this were extreme|ly hazardous to an inferior army, in fight of the enemy. The ope|rations of Prince Ferdinand, on this occa&s;ion, di&s;played &s;o pene|trating and uncommon a genius, &s;uch a guarded boldne&s;s, &s;uch a certainty of the grounds he went upon, &s;uch a perfect po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him&s;elf, that perhaps there is no in&s;tance in hi&s;tory of general&s;hip &s;o compleat and fini&s;hed; for which rea&s;on we &s;hall endeavour from the be&s;t lights we have, to draw out at length the &s;everal parts that con|to
<PB N="93" REF="105">
form this remarkable piece; we could indeed wi&s;h that the authentick accounts of &s;o very memorable an event, had been more clear and explicit; but we mu&s;t content our&s;elves with the ma|terials we have.</P>
<P>On the 29th of July, Prince Fer|dinand for&s;ook his camp on the We&s;er, and marched towards Hil|len, a village con&s;iderably to his right, with the greate&s;t part of his army: However he took care to leave on the brink of that river, a body under General Wangenheim; which extended to the town of Thornhau&s;en, where they were intrenched, and &s;upported by a con&s;iderable artillery. He had the day before detached the He|reditary Prince of Brun&s;wick, <NOTE PLACE="marg">July, 28.</NOTE> with 6000 men, to make a compa&s;s towards the enemy's left flank, and to po&s;t him&s;elf in &s;uch a manner, as to cut off the commu|nication of their convoys from Pader|born.</P>
<P>The French were not inat|tentive to the&s;e movements; their Generals immediately held a coun|cil of war; and the re&s;ult was, that they gave completely into the &s;nare that was laid for them. They &s;aw, as they imagined, the allied army divided and disjointed; and now the happy moment pre&s;ented it&s;elf, for the attack of General Wangen|heim, who they knew was not &s;trong, and who &s;eemed at a great di&s;tance from the re&s;t of the army, &s;o that it appeared impo&s;&s;ible that he could be relieved. This body being routed, as it ea&s;ily might, it was obvious that they &s;hould then be able to place them&s;elves be|tween Prince Ferdinand's army and the We&s;et, and cut off his commu|nication with that river; the great object at which they aimed, through the whole campaign, and in which was involved the certain de&s;truction of the allies.</P>
<P>Full of the&s;e ideas they left their advantageous po&s;t, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 1.</NOTE> in eight columns pa&s;&s;ed the mora&s;s in their front, and advanced into the plain. The Duke of Broglio was to lead the attack, by falling upon that body that lay near the river, which &s;eemed to pre&s;ent him an a&s;&s;ured and ea&s;y victory. He marched on, therefore, with great confidence; but as &s;oon as he had gained an e|minence which lay along his front, he was &s;truck with the utmo&s;t &s;ur|prize, when, in&s;tead of a few po&s;ts weakly guarded, he beheld the whole army of the allies drawn up in excellent order, extending from the banks of the We&s;er, quite to the mora&s;s, in the front of the late French camp. This was a &s;troke entirely unexpected: they believed the Prince to have been at Hillen; but he had marched up, and the whole army was joined in the night. This di&s;covery for a while put a &s;top to the motions of the French; they were hemmed in between the allies, the mora&s;s and the river. Their &s;ituation was di&s;agreeable, but it was now impo&s;&s;ible to recede.</P>
<P>The allies, finding the French &s;lower than they expected, began to advance, and threatened the e|nemy's center. This was compo&s;ed almo&s;t wholly of hor&s;e; but it was the flower of their cavalry, who anticipated the &s;hock of the al|lies, and began the engagement. The brunt of the battle was almo&s;t wholly &s;u&s;tained by the Engli&s;h infantry, and &s;ome corps of Hanoverians, which &s;tood the reiterated charges of &s;o many bo|dies of hor&s;e, the &s;trength and glory of the French armies, with a re&s;olution, &s;teadine&s;s, and expert|ne&s;s in their manoeuvre, which was
<PB N="94" REF="106">
never exceeded, perhaps never e|qualled. They cut to pieces or en|tirely routed the&s;e bodies. Two brigades of foot attempted to &s;up|port them, but they vani&s;hed before the Engli&s;h infantry. Waldgrave's and King&s;ley's regiments di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in a particular manner this day; nor were their command|ers le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed. The enemy's hor&s;e which compo&s;ed their center being entirely di&s;comfited, and their right, which attacked Wangenheim, having made no &s;ort of impre&s;&s;ion, they thought of nothing but a re|treat.</P>
<P>At this point of time the Prince &s;ent orders to Ld. George Sackville, who commanded the whole Briti&s;h, and &s;everal brigades of the German cavalry to advance. That cavalry formed the right wing of the allies, extended to the mora&s;s, and if it could have charged at the in&s;tant of the enemy's retreat, &s;uch a &s;hock at that time, and in that &s;ituation, would in all probability have left the French without an army in Ger|many. But the orders were not &s;ufficiently preci&s;e, or they were not &s;ufficiently under&s;tood by the Engli&s;h commander; &s;o that there was &s;ome delay in waiting for an explanation. The critical minute pa&s;&s;ed away; the Briti&s;h cavalry lo&s;t their &s;hare in the glory of the action; and the French retreated in &s;ome order, favoured by the &s;pirited and well-judged efforts of the Duke of Broglio, and the advantages which the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Minden gave them.</P>
<P>What is remarkable, the French attributed their misfortune in this battle to the &s;ame error in their di&s;po&s;ition, which lo&s;t them the battle of Blenheim; that of com|po&s;ing their center almo&s;t wholly of cavalry, without any proper &s;up|port of foot.</P>
<P>The battle was over; but then it was that the effects of Prince Ferdi|nand's admirable di&s;po&s;itions ap|peared in their full lu&s;tre. The French not having been mole&s;ted by the Briti&s;h cavalry in their re|treat, had an opportunity of re|gaining their former advantageous po&s;t. They had, indeed, lo&s;t the honour of the day, and mi&s;&s;ed the &s;troke which they had meditated. They had likewi&s;e lo&s;t a great num|ber of men. But all the&s;e lo&s;&s;es and di&s;graces might be repaired, and there &s;eemed nothing deci&s;ive in the day of Minden. It had cer|tainly happened, as it then ap|peared, if the Prince who fore&s;ee|ing this, and neglecting nothing which could be provided, had not formed the plan of detaching away the Hereditary Prince in the man|ner already related. At five in the morning of that day, this young hero attacked a large body of the French under the Duke de Bri&s;ac; this body, though po&s;ted in a mo&s;t advantageous manner, he entirely defeated, and obliged them to take refuge in Minden. The news of this blow came with an ill omen to M. de Contades, in the in&s;tant when the Engli&s;h infantry began to engage his center. The enemy him&s;elf could not help admiring the dexterity of the &s;troke under which he &s;unk: and full of a&s;toni&s;hment at a con|duct at once &s;o daring and judicious, paid the ju&s;t applau&s;e to a Ge|neral, who could detach with &s;ecu|rity &s;o large a body from his army, when he was going to attack an e|nemy already much &s;uperior to him in numbers.</P>
<P>This happy &s;troke decided the affair, all the pa&s;&s;es through which
<PB N="95" REF="107">
the French could draw &s;uccour or provi&s;ion, were &s;eized. They re|linqui&s;hed their &s;trong po&s;t; they fled through Minden, and pa&s;&s;ing the We&s;er, retreated to the ea&s;t|ward of that river; thus lo&s;ing all the advantages which they had made in the campaign, and forced to retreat through a country dif|ferent from that through which they had advanced, and in which they had taken no mea&s;ures to pro|cure &s;ub&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of the French in this action amounted to about &s;even thou|&s;and men killed, wounded and pri|&s;oners; among whom were many officers of con&s;iderable rank. The lo&s;s of the allies was not more than two thou&s;and. The Engli&s;h as they gained the greate&s;t glory, &s;o they were the greate&s;t &s;ufferers. Twelve hundred of the killed and wounded were of that nation. The Prince on the day after the battle paid the due honours to the&s;e illu&s;trious corps, as well as to &s;everal of the Hanoverians who had behaved in the &s;ame gallant manner. He did ju&s;tice to the merit of the officers; he di&s;tingui&s;hed their names; and even particulari&s;ed &s;o low as cap|tains. To &s;ome in the mo&s;t o|bliging manner he &s;ent con&s;iderable pre&s;ents; and he omitted nothing to &s;hew that he knew what it is to be well &s;erved, and how to en|courage the troops and officers to do their duty with &s;pirit and cheer|fulne&s;s.</P>
<P>Although the Engli&s;h had the greate&s;t &s;hare in the honour of this &s;ignal day, and that the Prince ac|knowledged their merit in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, yet a cloud was ca&s;t over their triumph. There were &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions in the orders for the rejoicing, which were &s;uppo&s;ed to convey a very &s;evere reflection on Lord G. S. commander in chief of the Engli&s;h forces. The Prince re|quired with an empha&s;is, which &s;eemed particularly pointed, that his orders by his aids de camps for the future &s;hould be more ex|actly obeyed. In a manner &s;till le&s;s to be mi&s;under&s;tood, he expre&s;&s;ed his concern that the Marquis of Granby had not had the com|mand of the Briti&s;h cavalry. Had he commanded, his highne&s;s made no doubt that the &s;ucce&s;s of the day had been much more compleat and brilliant. The &s;evere in&s;inua|tion concerning the di&s;obedience to orders, and the invidious compli|ment to a &s;ubordinate officer, were clear declarations.</P>
<P>The news of a victory &s;o glorious to our troops, and of a cen&s;ure &s;o di&s;graceful to their commander, came at once to England. In propor|tion to the joy which filled all hearts, in proportion to their opinion of the great general to whom they owed &s;o &s;ea&s;onable an advantage, was their indignation again&s;t the unfortunate commander to whom it was attri|buted that this advantage was not greater. The public as u&s;ual judged definitively upon the fir&s;t charge. They never pardon a general who&s;e error it is to fall &s;hort. In vain they are prayed to &s;u&s;pend their judg|ment, and to wait for a full di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion; the matter is already decid|ed; they have a fact again&s;t an offi|cer, and they look upon all rea&s;on|ing in his favour, not &s;o much a defence of his conduct, as the exer|tion of eloquence and artifice to pal|liate a neglect of duty. This indeed makes the ca&s;e of officers particularly hard; but then it always &s;hews them what they have to do.</P>
<P>The merits of the matter are
<PB N="96" REF="108">
&s;till regarded in the &s;ame light by the public. But the heat, the ea|gerne&s;s, and curio&s;ity of the fir&s;t movements being over, the matter will be heard, whenever it comes to be again di&s;cu&s;&s;ed with le&s;s attention, but with le&s;s pa&s;&s;ion too. It is not for us to deliver any opinion in &s;o nice a controver&s;y. We have in points of le&s;s moment hitherto de|clined it; and we &s;hall always de|cline it until the proper judges be|fore whom it probably will come, &s;hall have taught us what to think. There is indeed no doubt that if the cavalry of the allies right wing, &s;i|tuated as it was, had been brought to act at the critical time when it had orders to move, the battle of Min|den had proved as deci&s;ive as that of Hoc&s;tet. But whether it was a fault in the giving or the delivering of the orders, or whether it was &s;ome mi&s;|apprehen&s;ion in him who received them, we cannot but &s;incerely pity a commander of &s;uch admirable ta|lents, who by the error or the mis|fortune of a moment, lo&s;t an op|portunity that would have ranked him for ever with the Marlboroughs and the Brun&s;wicks.</P>
<P>A few days after the battle his lord&s;hip re&s;igned his command and returned to London. He was but a few days in London when he was deprived of all his military em|ployments. The Marquis of Gran|by, whom the opinion of Prince Ferdinand, and the de&s;ires of the whole army had pointed out, &s;uc|ceeded him in his command. A generous and ardent courage, an affability of manners that flowed from no artifice, a manly freedom and openne&s;s of &s;oul, a chearful and unre&s;erved conver&s;ation, a mu|nificence that knew no bounds, &s;o many qualities of the man and of the &s;oldier, endeared him to the whole army, and rendered Engli&s;h and foreigners, his inferiors, his e|quals and his &s;uperior in command, unanimous in his favour.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e changes were mak|ing, Prince Ferdinand lo&s;t no time to improve his victory, by the pur|&s;uit of the French who retired in the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s. The allies were not indeed able to overtake the main body of their army, but they hara&s;&s;ed them extremely, and the French were obliged to &s;acrifice a great part of their army piece|meal to pre&s;erve the re&s;t entire. The nece&s;&s;ity of providing &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence drove them towards Ca&s;&s;el. The Prince pur&s;ued them, obliged them to evacuate that place, and once more freed that poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed country from the French tyranny. The ca&s;tle of Ziegenhayn after an hour's defence gave the allies about four hundred pri&s;oners. After this the Heredi|tary <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug 23.</NOTE> Prince of Brun&s;wick, equally con&s;picuous in the greater and the le&s;&s;er operations of war, made a private march at night in or|der <NOTE PLACE="marg">27.</NOTE> to &s;urprize a corps of French irregulars commanded by the fa|mous partizan Fi&s;cher, which were po&s;ted at Wetter, where it was convenient for the allies to en|camp. This corps he entirely rout|ed, killing a great number and taking four hundred. The French threw a garri&s;on into Marpurg, in hopes of putting &s;ome &s;top to the rapid career of the allies. In effect this did prove an ob&s;tacle for &s;ome days, but at length the ca&s;tle &s;urren|dered, and the garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ting of between eight <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 11.</NOTE> and nine hundred men became pri|&s;oners of war.</P>
<P>Here a bound was &s;et of the pro|gre&s;s

of the allied arms. Not that they were &s;topped by any con&s;ider|able ob&s;truction from the main body of the French in that quarter, but from &s;ome effects in another quar|ter of the un&s;ucce&s;sful beginning of the campaign, from which the bat|tle of Minden had not yet perfectly di&s;engaged them. Mun&s;ter was &s;till behind them, and &s;till in the hands of the enemy, who had a power|ful garri&s;on in that city. M. de Contades, who even after his de|feat exceeded the allies in numbers, and had now no further view of an offen&s;ive campaign, &s;ent a &s;trong body under d'Armentieres, which was reinforced by &s;ome troops from the Lower Rhine, to near fifteen thou&s;and men, to cover that place. Prince Ferdinand had before detach|ed General Imhoff from Ca&s;&s;el in order to reduce it. On the ap|proach of d'Armentieres, Imhoff was obliged to rai&s;e the &s;iege. But <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 6.</NOTE> being &s;oon after reinforced, the French commander re|tired in his turn towards We&s;el, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of which place has all a|long proved of infinite importance to the French in all their operations. The &s;iege of Mun&s;ter was again re&s;umed, but the bu&s;ine&s;s threaten|ed to be difficult and tedious. This however was the only rub which the allies encountered. In all other re&s;pects they were perfectly fortu|nate. They had driven their e|nemy two hundred miles before them, and at the end of the cam|paign, after all their efforts, and all their &s;anguine hopes of conque&s;t, &s;et them down ju&s;t where they had begun it.</P>
<P>The event of the battle of Min|den, and the &s;ub&s;equent misfortunes of the French arms, threw Ver|&s;ailles into the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion. The news of that defeat arrived ju&s;t as the King was taking hor&s;e to hunt. He retired &s;ilent and deject|ed into the apartment of Madam de Pompadour, and for &s;ome time &s;aw none of his mini&s;ters. The Duke of Broglio and M. de Contades mu|tually accu&s;ed each other, for the ill conduct of that day. The public acquitted Broglio. Bellei&s;le and his general Contades lo&s;t all reputation: but the duke &s;till pre&s;erved his em|ployment and a con&s;iderable part of his influence at court.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the fir&s;t confu&s;ion and &s;urprize of &s;o unexpected an event was a little abated; it was re&s;olved to &s;end reinforcements to their ar|my in Germany, and at the &s;ame time to &s;end thither &s;ome officer of experience and authority, who might judge, and compo&s;e, if po&s;|&s;ible, the differences which &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ed between the commanders; as well as to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the deliberations for retrieving their affairs. Pub|lic misfortunes call great men from their ob&s;curity. M. de Etrees was cho&s;en on this occa&s;ion, and in|ve&s;ted with an authority which he unwillingly accepted. When he arrived at the French camp, he could not avoid <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 25.</NOTE> a &s;igh on viewing of the ruins of that army, which had triumphed under his command at Ha&s;tenbeck. However, his behaviour to M. de Contades was polite and generous. The old Marechal told him that he was not come to take his com|mand, but to &s;erve under him; and whil&s;t he a&s;&s;i&s;ted him with his advice, he would receive his or|ders.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the French endeavoured to piece up their broken fortune in Germany, they made &s;ome &s;how
<PB N="98" REF="111">
of pu&s;hing the other part of their &s;cheme with vigour. All their ports were full of the preparations for an inva&s;ion of the Briti&s;h dominions. Men of war, tran&s;ports and flat|bottomed boats, now almo&s;t a word of ridicule, were prepared with great diligence. They talked of a triple embarkation. M. Thurot was to command a &s;mall &s;quadron and &s;everal tran&s;ports from Dun|kirk, which it was believed were intended for Scotland. This man from a ma&s;ter of a merchant &s;hip became a captain of a privateer, in which capacity he greatly annoyed the Engli&s;h trade, and acquired a reputation. At a time when France does not abound with great men, his &s;ervices in this way and his da|ring &s;pirit, recommended him to a command in the King's &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign again&s;t England, as the voyage hither is the &s;horte&s;t, was to be attempted from Havre, and &s;ome other ports of Normandy, in flat-bottomed boats. The third embarkation, which was &s;uppo&s;ed again&s;t Ireland, was to be made from Vannes in the Lower Brit|tany, where a large body of troops was a&s;&s;embled, commanded by the Duke d'Aiguillon governor of that province. This embarkation was to be covered by the fleet under M. de Conflans, which was preparing with great diligence in Bre&s;t. Had this de&s;ign been &s;uch as it was repre|&s;ented, and had it been put into execution, there is no doubt but &s;uch an attempt upon both king|doms, at three different places at once, mu&s;t have thrown the whole into no &s;mall confu&s;ion. But ex|cellent mea&s;ures were taken on the part of England to fru&s;trate their de&s;igns, whatever they might have been.</P>
<P>A &s;quadron under Commodore Boys was &s;tationed before Dun|kirk. Admiral Rodney was &s;ent to bombard Havre, which &s;ervice he performed with &s;ucce&s;s. Admiral Hawke blocked up the harbour of Bre&s;t with a &s;trong &s;quadron, whil&s;t a le&s;&s;er kept a watch upon that of Vannes. The&s;e precautions were continued the whole &s;ummer, during which time the French pro|ceeded rather &s;lowly, but after the battle of Minden had de&s;troyed their hopes in Germany, they turn|ed to this object with the greater attention. What i&s;&s;ue it had we &s;hall relate in its proper place. But their fir&s;t attempts on the ocean proved as un&s;ucce&s;sful as their arms on land.</P>
<P>A great fleet was equipped at Toulon, which &s;ome de&s;tined for America, whil&s;t others believed it was de&s;igned to unite it&s;elf with that of Bre&s;t to favour the inva&s;ion. Admiral Bo&s;cawen who command|ed in the Mediterranean, blocked up this &s;quadron, until &s;ome unfa|vourable weather and the foulne&s;s of his &s;hips obliged him to return to Gibraltar to refit. The French took this opportunity to &s;ail out, and they pro|ceeded <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 14.</NOTE> with great diligence to the &s;treights.</P>
<P>They had arrived very near Gi|braltar before the admiral had no|tice of their approach; but not|with&s;tanding that our &s;hips were not perfectly prepared to &s;ail, the admi|ral u&s;ed &s;uch great expedition that in two hours after the account arrived the Engli&s;h fleet was out at &s;ea.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h fleet was compo&s;ed of fourteen &s;hips of the line be&s;ides frigates. The enemy had twelve of the line. They were &s;uperior in the bulk of their &s;hips and in the
<PB N="99" REF="112">
number of men, if they were inferior in the number of ve&s;&s;els; and it is the opinion of many per&s;ons of judg|ment, that if they had formed a line of battle, and fought Mr. Bof|cawen in order, they might very well have hoped for a better i&s;&s;ue of this matter than they found. But the evil genius of France operating on the cowardice or incapacity of their commander, induced them to &s;eparate their fleet and fly. The Engli&s;h &s;hips were newly refitted; they proved better &s;ailors; and the men, animated with the &s;pirited example of their Admiral, en|gaged the French &s;hips as they could overtake them; and they overtook &s;ome of them off Cape Lagos in Portugal. A bri&s;k eagage|ment en&s;ued. Two of the enemy's &s;hips, the Ocean and the Redoubt|able, were run on &s;hore and burn|ed. The fir&s;t was the &s;hip of M. de la Clue, the French Admiral, who e&s;caped to land; but being grie|vou&s;ly wounded, and, as it is &s;aid, having lo&s;t both his legs, he died &s;oon after. Two other capital &s;hips, the Centaure and Mode&s;te, were taken.</P>
<P>The &s;cattered remains of their fleet with difficulty got into the harbour of Cadiz, where they were &s;oon after blocked up, and where they &s;till remain. This action hap|pened on the 18th of Augu&s;t; and it gave a great eclat to the Briti&s;h arms, which, in the &s;ame month, had triumphed &s;o &s;ignally both by &s;ea and land.</P>

<P>AS the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's victory at Ro&s;bach had given the Hanoverians an opportunity to free their country, it might be ex|pected that the affair at Minden would have &s;erved to free his Pru&s;|&s;ian Maje&s;ty from &s;ome of the nu|merous armies that oppre&s;&s;ed him. But as this battle was fought in the middle of the &s;ea&s;on for action, and as Mun&s;ter &s;till continued in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the French, Prince Ferdinand could not venture at that time, to make any detachment from his army in the King's favour, without ri&s;quing all the advantages which he had obtained from his victory. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia was therefore left alone to &s;truggle with Au&s;trians, Ru&s;&s;ians, Imperiali&s;ts and Swedes</P>
<P>The Ru&s;&s;ians, who&s;e motions go|verned tho&s;e of all the other armies, left their camp at Po&s;na in Poland, and quitting the Vi&s;tula, drew near to the banks of the Oder. They were under the command of a Ru&s;&s;ian nobleman, Count Soltikoff. Count Dohna, who had been order|ed to oppo&s;e them, &s;aw that their numbers were too con&s;iderable, and their po&s;ts too &s;trong to be attack|ed with any pro&s;pect of advantage, &s;o that he contented him&s;elf with ob&s;erving their motions, and ha|ra&s;&s;ing their march. This conduct &s;eemed more dilatory and timid than the circum&s;tances, or the in|clinations
<PB N="100" REF="113">
of the King could bear. He is &s;aid to have reproached that General in &s;o &s;evere a manner, for a conduct in which he was in all pro|bability very ju&s;tifiable, that he took the fir&s;t opportunity to re&s;ign his command, and, under a pretence of recovering his health, retired to Berlin. The King immediately put General Wedel into his place, with po&s;itive orders to engage the Ru&s;|&s;ian army at all events. To enable him to obey his commands, he re|inforced him with &s;everal detach|ments from his own army. The po&s;itivene&s;s of the King's orders on this occa&s;ion may perhaps be cen|&s;ured; but it mu&s;t be owned, that the time required a cour&s;e next to de&s;perate. His hereditary domi|nions were in the utmo&s;t danger, and nothing but &s;ome great and fortunate &s;troke could effectually prevent the junction of the Au&s;trian and Ru&s;&s;ian armies, an event which, of all others, he had the greate&s;t rea|&s;on to dread.</P>
<P>Fortified in &s;ome mea&s;ure by the reinforcements he had received, and in con&s;equence of his orders, Ge|neral Wedel re&s;olved to attack the Ru&s;&s;ians on their march. They <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 23.</NOTE> had got to Zulichau and directed their cour&s;e to Cro&s;&s;en in Sile&s;ia, to get before the Pru&s;&s;ian army, and to make good the pa&s;&s;age of the Oder. The &s;itu|ation of the Ru&s;&s;ians was very ad|vantageous; po&s;ted upon eminen|ces, defended by a powerful artil|lery, and near &s;eventy thou&s;and &s;trong. The Pru&s;&s;ian army fell &s;hort of thirty thou&s;and; and they had greater di&s;advantages than their inferiority of number to get over. They had a bridge to pa&s;s, and &s;uch a narrow defile to &s;truggle through, that &s;carce a third of a battalion could march in front. The ground was &s;uch, that the cavalry could not &s;upport their infantry. Yet with all the&s;e difficulties the attack was long and re&s;olute. But this re&s;olution made their repul&s;e, which all the&s;e di&s;advantages had rendered inevitable, far more bloody and di&s;tre&s;sful. Four thou&s;and &s;e|ven hundred were killed or pri|&s;oners: the wounded came to three thou&s;and. General Wober&s;now, an officer of great ability, was killed, and General Manteuffel was wounded. The Pru&s;&s;ians were obliged to re|tire, but they were not pur&s;ued, and they pa&s;&s;ed the Oder without mo|le&s;tation. The Ru&s;&s;ians &s;eized upon the towns of Cro&s;&s;en and Frankfort on the Oder.</P>
<P>The King of Pru&s;&s;ia, &s;ince the be|ginning of the war, had never hi|therto obtained an advantage where he was not per&s;onally pre&s;ent. His pre&s;ence now became more nece&s;&s;a|ry than ever. Since the action at Zulichau, the Ru&s;&s;ians had pene|trated a con&s;iderable way into his territories, and had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the important city of Frankfort upon the Oder. He therefore marched with ten thou&s;and of his be&s;t troops, to join the broken army of Wedel, in order to drive this formidable and determined enemy from his country. Prince Henry command|ed the remainder of his army, which was too well po&s;ted to fear any in|&s;ult during his ab&s;ence. The eyes of all were fixed upon his march, and his &s;oldiers, who remembered Zorndorf, eagerly longed to try their &s;trength once more with the &s;ame antagoni&s;ts.</P>
<P>M. Daun was not unappri&s;ed of the motions of the Ru&s;&s;ians, or the de&s;igns of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. He knew that the great fault of the
<PB N="101" REF="114">
Ru&s;&s;ian troops, was the want of a regular and firm cavalry, which might be depended upon in a day of action. This defect was a prin|cipal cau&s;e of their misfortune at Zorndorf in the la&s;t year; a mi&s;|fortune which di&s;concerted all the operations of that campaign. As this was the only want which the Ru&s;&s;ians were under, &s;o it was that which Daun was be&s;t able to &s;upply at a &s;hort warning. With this view he &s;elected about twelve thou&s;and of his hor&s;e, and there is no better hor&s;e than that of the Au&s;trians, which with about eight thou&s;and foot he placed under the command of General Laudon, one of the a|ble&s;t officers in that &s;ervice. This body was divided into two columns, one of which marched through Si|le&s;ia, and the other through Lu|&s;atia. By extreme good fortune and conduct with little lo&s;s or oppo|&s;ition, they both joined the Ru&s;&s;ian army, and were received with tran|&s;ports of joy.</P>
<P>In the mean time the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, who was unable to prevent <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 4.</NOTE> this &s;troke, joined General Wedel at Muhlro&s;e, and took upon him the command of the united armies. But &s;till finding him|&s;elf too weak for the deci&s;ive action he was preparing to attempt, he re|called Gen. Finck, whom he had &s;ent &s;ome time before into Saxony with nine thou&s;and men, in order to oppo&s;e the Imperiali&s;ts in that coun|try. With the&s;e reinforcements he was not able to rai&s;e his army to fifty thou&s;and compleat. That of the Ru&s;&s;ians &s;ince the junction of Laudon, was upwards of ninety thou&s;and. They had be&s;ides taken a po&s;t which they had &s;o &s;trongly entrenched, and defended with &s;uch a prodigious number of cannon, that it was extremely difficult and hazardous to attempt them, yet un|der the&s;e accumulated di&s;advanta|ges, it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould fight. The detachments from Count Daun's army already menaced Berlin; Saxony which he was obliged to leave expo&s;ed, had become a prey to the Imperiali&s;ts; and the Ru&s;&s;ians united with the Au&s;trians encamped before his eyes in Sile&s;ia, the be&s;t and riche&s;t part of his dominions. In &s;hort, his for|mer reputation, his pre&s;ent difficul|ties, his future hopes, every mo|tive of honour and of &s;afety de|manded an engagement; the cam|paign ha&s;ted to a deci&s;ion, and it was evident that nothing farther could be done by marches and choice of po&s;ts. The &s;anguine tem|per of other generals has often obli|ged them to fight under di&s;advan|tages; but the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's cir|cum&s;tances were &s;uch, that from the multitude of his enemies, he was neither able to con&s;ult times nor &s;ituations. Ra&s;hne&s;s could hardly dictate, any thing which in his con|dition, would not have been recom|mended by prudence.</P>
<P>When the attack was re&s;olved, the King's troops <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 12.</NOTE> put them&s;elves in motion at two in the morning, and having formed them&s;elves in a wood, advanced to|wards the enemy. It was near e|leven before the action began. The principal effort of the King of Pru&s;|&s;ia was again&s;t the left wing of the Ru&s;&s;ian army. He began ac|cording to their u&s;ual method, with a fierce cannonade, which hav|ing had the effect he de&s;ired from it, he attacked that wing with &s;everal battalions di&s;po&s;ed in columns.</P>
<P>The Ru&s;&s;ian entrenchments were forced with great &s;laughter. Se|venty-two pieces of cannon were
<PB N="102" REF="115">
taken. But &s;till there was a defile to be pa&s;&s;ed, and &s;everal redoubts to be ma&s;tered which covered the village of Cunner&s;dorf. The&s;e were attacked with the &s;ame re&s;olution, and taken one after another. The enemy made another &s;tand at the village, and endeavoured to pre|&s;erve their ground there, by pu&s;h|ing forward &s;everal battalions of hor&s;e and foot; but their re&s;i&s;tance there proved not more effectual than it had done every where el&s;e; they were driven from po&s;t to po&s;t quite to the la&s;t redoubts. For up|wards of &s;ix hours Fortune favour|ed the Pru&s;&s;ians, who every where broke the enemy with an unparal|lelled &s;laughter. They had driven them from almo&s;t all the ground which they had occupied before the battle, they had taken more than half their artillery; &s;carce any thing &s;eemed wanting to the mo&s;t com|plete deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>The King in tho&s;e circum&s;tances wrote a billet to the Queen to this effect, <Q>&startq;Madam, we have beat the Ru&s;&s;ians from their entrench|ments. In two hours expect to hear of a glorious victory.&endq;</Q> This news arrived at Berlin, ju&s;t as the po&s;t was going out, and the friends of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia throughout Europe, exulted in a certain and conclu&s;ive victory. Mean time For|tune was preparing for him a terrible rever&s;e.</P>
<P>The enemy, defeated in almo&s;t every quarter, found their left wing &s;hattered as it was, to be more en|tire than any other part of the army. Count Soltikoff therefore a&s;&s;embled the remains of his right, and ga|thering as many as he could from the center, reinforced that wing, and made a &s;tand at a redoubt which had been erected on an advanta|geous eminence, in a place called <HI>the Jews burying ground.</HI> Nothing was wanting to fini&s;h matters in fa|vour of the King, but to drive the Ru&s;&s;ians from this their la&s;t hope. But this enterprize was difficult. It is confidently &s;aid, that the Pru&s;|&s;ian generals were unanimous in opinion, that they &s;hould not en|deavour at that time to pu&s;h any further the advantages they had obtained. They repre&s;ented to the King, that the enemy was &s;till ve|ry numerous, their artillery con&s;i|derable, and the po&s;t which they occupied of great &s;trength; that his brave troops who had been en|gaged for &s;o long a time, in the &s;e|vere&s;t action perhaps ever known, and in one of the hotte&s;t days ever felt, were too much exhau&s;ted for a new attempt; an attempt of &s;uch extreme difficulty as might daunt even troops that were quite fre&s;h. That the advantage he gained would be as deci&s;ive in its con&s;e|quences as that at Zorndorf; and whil&s;t the enemy filled the gazettes of their party, with frivolous di&s;|putes of the field of battle, he would be reaping as he did then, all the ef|fects of an unque&s;tioned victory. That the enemy would be obliged to retire immediately into Poland, and to leave him at liberty to act in other quarters, where his pre&s;ence was full as nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The&s;e rea&s;ons were very cogent; and for a few moments they &s;eemed to have &s;ome weight with the King. But his character &s;oon determined him to a contrary re&s;olution. He could not bear to be a conqueror by halves. One effort more was a|lone wanting to that victory, which would free him for ever from the adver&s;ary, which had leaned heavi|e&s;t on him during the whole war.</P>
<P>Once more he put all to the ha|zard.
<PB N="103" REF="116">
His infantry &s;till re&s;olute and &s;upported by their late &s;ucce&s;s, were readily brought to act again. They drew on their bodies fainting with heat and labour to a new attack. But the enterprize was beyond their &s;trength. The &s;ituation of the ene|my was impregnable; and their ar|tillery which began to be &s;uperior to that of the Pru&s;&s;ians, on account of the difficulty of the ground, which made it impo&s;&s;ible for the latter to bring up any other than a few &s;mall pieces, repul&s;ed the&s;e feeble batta|lions with a great &s;laughter. With an a&s;toni&s;hing, perhaps with a blame|able per&s;everance, the Pru&s;&s;ian in|fantry was brought to a &s;econd at|tack, and were a &s;econd time re|pul&s;ed, and with a lo&s;s greater than at fir&s;t. The&s;e efforts being un&s;uc|ce&s;sful, the affair was put to the ca|valry. They made redoubled but u&s;ele&s;s attacks; the hor&s;es were &s;pent as well as tho&s;e they carried.</P>
<P>It was ju&s;t at that time when the Pru&s;&s;ian hor&s;e was wa&s;ted by the&s;e un&s;ucce&s;sful efforts, that the greate&s;t part of the Ru&s;&s;ian, and the whole body of the Au&s;trian cavalry, which had been hitherto quite inactive, and which was therefore quite fre&s;h, ru&s;hed down upon them, broke them to pieces, forced them back up|on their foot, and threw the whole into irreparable di&s;order. The whole army was &s;eized with a panic; and in a few minutes tho&s;e troops &s;o lately victorious and irre&s;i&s;table, were total|ly di&s;per&s;ed and defeated. The King did every thing to re&s;tore the field, hazarding his per&s;on even be|yond his former daring, and prodi|gal of a life which he &s;eemed to think ought not to be &s;eparated from conque&s;t. Thrice he led on his troops to the charge; two hor&s;es were killed under him; &s;everal balls were in his cloaths, The ef|forts of &s;kill, courage and de&s;pair were made, and proved ineffectual; a &s;ingle error outweighed them all. Scarcely a general, hardly an infe|rior officer in the army was without &s;ome wound. That of General Seidlitz was particularly unfortunate; for to that wound the failure of the hor&s;e which he commanded was principally attributed. It was to the &s;pirit and conduct of this able officer, that a great part of the &s;ucce&s;s at Zorndorf was owing, in the la&s;t cam|paign. Is is known, that if it had not been for a &s;ea&s;onable movement of the hor&s;e, the whole Pru&s;&s;ian army had then been in great danger of a defeat.</P>
<P>The night and the prudent u&s;e of &s;ome eminences, which were de|fended as well as circum&s;tances would admit, pre&s;erved the Pru&s;&s;ian army from total de&s;truction. However, their lo&s;s was far greater than any which they had &s;u&s;tained from the beginning of the war. All their cannon was taken. The killed, wounded and pri&s;oners, by the mo&s;t favourable accounts were near twen|ty thou&s;and. General Putkammer was killed on the &s;pot. The&s;e ge|nerals who&s;e names are &s;o di&s;tingui&s;h|ed in this war, Itzenplitz, Hul&s;en, Finck, Wedel, and Seidlitz, were among the wounded; as was the Prince of Wurtenburg, and five ma|jor generals. The enemy could not have fewer than ten thou&s;and killed on their &s;ide. For hardly ever was a more bloody battle.</P>
<P>When the King of Pru&s;&s;ia found him&s;elf obliged to quit the field, he &s;ent another di&s;patch to the Queen expre&s;&s;ed in this manner, <Q>&startq;Re|move from Berlin with the roy|al family. Let the archives be
<PB N="104" REF="117">
carried to Potzdam. The town may make conditions with the enemy.&endq;</Q> We &s;hould in vain at|tempt to draw the picture of the court and city, on the receipt of &s;uch news in the mid&s;t of the joy, which they indulged for that which they had received but a few hours before. The terror was increa&s;ed by the in|di&s;tinct relation that &s;oon followed, which gave them only to under&s;tand that their army was totally routed; that there was no account of the King, and that a Ru&s;&s;ian army was advancing to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their city.</P>
<P>The day after the battle the King of Pru&s;&s;ia repa&s;&s;ed the Oder, and encamped at Retwein. From thence he moved to Fu&s;tenwalde, and placed him&s;elf in &s;uch a manner that the Ru&s;&s;ians did not venture to make any attempt upon Berlin. He continually watched their army; a part of which in&s;tead of turning to|wards Brandenburgh marched into Lu&s;atia, where it joined that of the Au&s;trians. Here the victorious Ge|neral Soltikoff, for the fir&s;t time, met M. Daun, and amid&s;t rejoicings and congratulations, con&s;ulted about the mea&s;ures for improving their &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The Ru&s;&s;ian and Au&s;trian armies thus united, &s;carce &s;eemed from their &s;trength and their victories to have any other deliberation left, than of what part of the Pru&s;&s;ian dominions they &s;hould take imme|diate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The King was twice defeated with a va&s;t lo&s;s. He was cut off from all communication with the army of his brother Prince Henry; yet to the a&s;toni&s;hment of all the world, the &s;uperior, the victorious and united army acted upon the defen&s;ive, and were cur|bed in all their motions, and fru&s;|trated in all their de&s;igns by the in|ferior, the beaten and divided. Nothing ever &s;hewed the genius of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia more fully than his conduct after the battle of Cunner&s;dorf. In a few days after &s;o terrible a defeat, every thing was in order in his camp. He &s;up|plied the lo&s;s of his artillery from his &s;tores in Berlin. He recalled Ge|neral Klei&s;t with about five thou|&s;and men from Pomerania; in pre|&s;ence of two &s;uch armies as tho&s;e of M. Daun and Count Soltikoff, he detached &s;ix thou&s;and men from his &s;mall body, to the relief of Saxony, where the army of the Empire had availed it&s;elf of his ab&s;ence to reduce the whole coun|try. Hall, Wittemberg, Leip&s;ic, Torgan, and at la&s;t Dre&s;den it&s;elf had opened their gates to the Im|periali&s;ts. With the remainder of his troops he put him&s;elf between the Ru&s;&s;ians and Great Glogau, co|vered that city which was the ob|ject of the enemy's de&s;igns, and &s;aw them &s;oon after, notwith&s;tand|ing their two victories, obliged to return again into Poland; and to leave him free for the re&s;t of the campaign.</P>
<P>What was done by the King of Pru&s;&s;ia &s;ince that time, will be the &s;ubject of another chapter; after we have related the proceedings of the Engli&s;h and French in America, to which the order of time directs our pre&s;ent attention. But we cannot di&s;mi&s;s the affairs of Germany, in which two &s;uch battles as tho&s;e of Minden and Cunner&s;dorf were fought, with events &s;o different for the common cau&s;e, without ob&s;erving &s;omething concerning the two gene|rals who conducted them.</P>
<P>They are certainly in reputation the fir&s;t in Europe, which probably
<PB N="105" REF="118">
never produced two greater men; Tho' they differ as much in their cha|racters, and in the kind of talents they po&s;&s;e&s;s, as they agree in the greatne&s;s of their abilities for war. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia, rapid, vehe|ment, impatient, often gives deci|&s;ive blows; but he often mi&s;&s;es his &s;troke, and wounds him&s;elf. Prince Ferdinand is cool, deliberate, ex|act, and guarded; he &s;ees every po&s;&s;ible advantage, he takes it at the moment, pur&s;ues it as far as it will go; but never attempts to pu&s;h it further. Nothing in the man di&s;turbs the commander. In him we do not &s;ee a per&s;on who is a great &s;oldier; it is the idea of a perfect General; it is a general in the ab&s;tract. Fer|dinand &s;uffers his temper to be gui|ded by his bu&s;ine&s;s. He never pre|cipitates matters; he takes them in their order and their cour&s;e, and tru&s;ts nothing to fortune. The King on the other hand leads, and even forces circum&s;tances; he does not endeavour to remove but to over|leap ob&s;tacles; he puts all to the ri&s;que; and by &s;uffering Fortune to play her part in his de&s;igns, he ac|quires a &s;plendor and eclat in his actions, which mere wi&s;dom could never give him. Prince Ferdinand is famous for never committing a fault. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia is above all the world, in repairing tho&s;e he has committed. Like &s;ome of the great ma&s;ters in writing, whenever he makes or &s;eems to make a mi&s;|take, it is a &s;ignal to the ob&s;erver, to prepare for &s;ome great and ad|mirable &s;troke of &s;pirit and conduct. His errors &s;eem to be &s;purs to his abilities. He commits an error, he repairs it; he errs again; and a|gain a&s;toni&s;hes us by his manner of e&s;caping. We &s;hould often con|demn the commander, but that we are always forced to admire the hero.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. <HI>Plan of the campaign in North America. Three expeditions. Ticonderoga and Crown Point abandoned. Col Town&s;hend killed. Expedition to Nia|gara. Col. Prideaux killed. Sir William John&s;on defeats the French. Takes Fort Niagara. Con&s;equen&ccedil;es of this.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE theatre of our operations in America is of &s;uch a va&s;t extent, that if we had per&s;evered in the cour&s;e we pur&s;ued for &s;ome time, in attacking but one place at once, the war would inevitably be &s;pun out to an extreme length, without bringing on any thing de|ci&s;ive; and it would have rendered our natural &s;uperiority of little u&s;e, by &s;uffering the French to collect, as they had hitherto done, their &s;trength into one &s;ingle point, which enabled them to contend with us, with a force &s;ufficient for the &s;er|vice in that country. This year a|nother method was followed. It was propo&s;ed to attack the French in all their &s;trong po&s;ts at once; to fall as nearly as po&s;&s;ible at the &s;ame time upon Crown Point, Niagara, and the forts to the &s;outh of Lake Erie, whil&s;t a great naval armament, and a con&s;iderable body of land|forces &s;hould attempt Quebec, by the River St. Lawrence.</P>
<P>This plan was very advi&s;able, as it tended to weaken by di&s;tracting the re&s;i&s;tance of the enemy, and whil&s;t we adhered to it, it was clearly impo&s;&s;ible for the French to main|tain their ground in any of tho&s;e
<PB N="106" REF="119">
places which were attacked, with|out very weakly defending, or even de&s;erting &s;ome of the others; and if, by the means of &s;uch diver&s;ions, any one of tho&s;e places &s;hould fall into our hands, the campaign could not be &s;aid to be &s;pent to no pur|po&s;e. But be&s;ides the end in di&s;|tracting the enemy's defence, there was another propo&s;ed of no le&s;s con|&s;equence; which was to make a concurrence in all the various ope|rations, &s;o that whil&s;t they divided the enemy, they might mutually &s;up|port one another.</P>
<P>General Amher&s;t, who commands the American forces in chief, with the mo&s;t con&s;iderable body, amount|ing, in regulars and provincials, to about twelve thou&s;and men, was to attack Ticonderoga and Crown Point by Lake George; the re|duction of tho&s;e forts would natu|rally lay open the Lake Champlain, where, having e&s;tabli&s;hed a &s;ufficient naval force, he was by the River Sorel, which forms the communi|cation between this Lake and the great River St. Lawrence, to pro|ceed directly to Quebec, the capital of Canada. Here he was to make a junction with General Wolfe and Admiral Saunders, who, having en|tered the River St. Lawrence at the oppo&s;ite quarter, would probably have commenced the &s;iege of Que|bec, by the time that General Am|her&s;t might find it practicable to join them. It was not doubted that if this junction could be affected, the reduction of that city would fol|low of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The third of the grand operations was again&s;t the fort, near the Falls of Niagara; a place of very great con&s;equence both in war and in peace. The reduction of this was committed to Brigadier General Prideaux, under whom Sir William John&s;on commanded the provinci|als of New York, and &s;everal Indi|ans of the Five Nations, who were engaged in our &s;ervice by the credit that gentleman has obtained among their tribes.</P>
<P>The object of this operation lay too remote from the others, to ex|pect, with any great confidence, that they could be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by its &s;ucce&s;s in any other manner than by weak|ening the enemy's forces. However it was hoped, that if they &s;hould be fortunate enough to take Niagara, early in the &s;ea&s;on, the troops might be embarked on the Lake Ontario, and finding no longer any ob&s;truction from Fort Fronte|nac, which was de&s;troyed la&s;t year, might fall down the River St. Law|rence, and po&s;&s;ibly either make them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Montreal, or by their approach at lea&s;t, draw &s;uch a force to that part, as greatly to facilitate our de&s;igns upon Quebec and Crown Point. But if this &s;cheme, in addition to its own end, &s;hould not facilitate either of the other two capital undertakings, it would probably, as it was the mo&s;t im|portant place the French had in that part of the world, draw all the troops they had upon the lakes to at|tempt its relief, which would leave the forts on tho&s;e lakes expo&s;ed to a fourth though inferior expedition, which was made again&s;t them under General Stanwix. In reality, it af|terwards had that effect.</P>
<P>The army under General Am|her&s;t was the fir&s;t in motion. The Lake George, or, as the French call it, Lake Sacrament, is a long, but, in proportion, narrow water, about forty miles in length, and enclo&s;ed on either &s;ide with mar|&s;hy grounds. This communicates
<PB N="107" REF="120">
by another long and very narrow &s;treight with Lake Champlain. This &s;treight is &s;ecured at each &s;ide by a fort; that to the &s;ide of Lake George is called Ticonderoga; that to the Champlain Lake is called Fort Frederick, or Crown Point; both extremely &s;trong in their &s;i|tuation; and the former of which had repul&s;ed our troops with a very con&s;iderable &s;laughter, as has been related among&s;t the events of the la&s;t year.</P>
<P>Amher&s;t after he had pa&s;&s;ed Lake George, arrived with very little oppo&s;ition from the enemy before Ticonderoga; at fir&s;t the French made &s;ome appearance, as if they meant to defend the place; but as they knew the &s;trength of our forces, as they &s;aw that the preparations for the attack were making with as much judgment as vigour, and as the enterprize which was preparing again&s;t Quebec did not leave them a force &s;o con&s;ider|able as they had there in the pre|ceding campaign, they abandoned their fort in the night, having da|maged <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 7.</NOTE> it as much as they could, and retired to Crown Point.</P>
<P>General Amher&s;t immediately &s;et him&s;elf about repairing the fortifi|cations of this po&s;t, which effectu|ally &s;ecured the Lake George; covered our colonies, and was of &s;uch va&s;t importance to enable him to pu&s;h forward his offen|&s;ive operations, or to favour his retreat in ca&s;e of a rever&s;e of for|tune. The only lo&s;s of any con|&s;equence which the Engli&s;h army &s;uffered, in making this valuable acqui&s;ition, was the death of Col. Town&s;end, who was killed in re|connoitring by a &s;hot from the fort. The &s;teady bravery, the promi&s;ing genius, and the agreeable manners of this officer, cau&s;ed this lo&s;s to be con&s;idered as a very great one. They compared this melancholy e|vent with the death of Lord Howe; they remembered how much the&s;e young &s;oldiers re&s;embled each other, both in their virtues and in the circum&s;tances of their fate. Both dear to the troops, and having both lo&s;t their lives on an expedition a|gain&s;t this place.</P>
<P>Although the general had rea&s;on to imagine, that the &s;ame rea&s;ons which had induced the enemy to abandon their fort and lines at Ti|conderoga, would per&s;uade them al&s;o to relinqui&s;h Crown Point; he took all his mea&s;ures with the &s;ame care, as if he expected an ob&s;tinate defence at the fort, and an attempt to &s;urprize him on his march. He re|membered how fatal &s;ecurity had proved to us in that part of the world upon many occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>The French abandoned the fort as it had been fore&s;een. The ge|neral retired with about three thou|&s;and five hundred men to the bot|tom of Lake Champlain, and po&s;ted him&s;elf at the i&s;land called I&s;le du Noix. He was &s;till pretty &s;trong on the lake, having &s;everal armed boats and &s;loops, with which he hoped to prevent the progre&s;s of the Engli&s;h into the interior parts of Canada. Amher&s;t as &s;oon as he had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Crown Point, u&s;ed every <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 14.</NOTE> endeavour to attain a naval &s;uperi|ority on the lake, and in the mean time began to fortify this po&s;t as he had that at Ticonderoga. To this time the French were actually e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in the heart of our territo|ries; &s;o that during a war of three years, we had in effect been only acting on the defen&s;ive. It was on the day on which Mr. Amher&s;t took
<PB N="108" REF="121">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Crown Point, that he received the agreeable news of the reduction of Niagara by the troops under Sir William John&s;on; and he had the plea&s;ure and encourage|ment of &s;eeing two of the great ob|jects of the campaign accompli&s;hed, whil&s;t he prepared him&s;elf to co-o|perate in the accompli&s;hment of the third, which was to be deci&s;ive of the whole. The body which had been appointed for Niagara under General Prideaux, without any ac|cident arrived at the fort, which lies at the bottom of the lake to|wards the &s;outh-we&s;t.</P>
<P>This is without exception the mo&s;t important po&s;t in America, and &s;ecures the greate&s;t number of com|munications. For it is &s;ituated at the very entrance of a &s;treight, by which the Lake Ontario is joined to that of Erie, which is connected with the other three great &s;eas of fre&s;h water, by the cour&s;e of the va&s;t river St. Laurence, which runs through them all, and carries off their &s;uperfluous waters to the ocean. A little above the fort is the cataract of Niagara, which is e&s;teemed the mo&s;t remarkable in the world, for the quantity of wa|ter and the greatne&s;s of the fall. This fall would interrupt the com|merce between the lakes, but for a road which the French have made up the hilly country that lies by the &s;treight; &s;o that there is here a good carrying-place, and not very tedious; for after a portage of about eight miles you reimbark again, and proceed without any interrupti|on to the Lake Erie.</P>
<P>As the great communication of tho&s;e who go by water is along this &s;treight, and carrying place, &s;o tho&s;e who travel by land are obliged to cro&s;s it. The lakes are &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, that without a &s;omewhat hazardous voyage, the Indians cannot any o|therwi&s;e pa&s;s from the north-we&s;t to the &s;outh-ea&s;t parts of North-Ame|rica for many hundred miles. The fort of Niagara thus naturally com|mands all the Five Nations, and all tho&s;e Indian tribes that lie to the northward of the lakes, as well as tho&s;e that are &s;cattered along the banks of the Ohio, Ouabache and Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, and according as it is po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Engli&s;h or the French, connects or disjoints the colonies of Canada and Loui&s;iana, protects or lays open our own, and is in all re&s;pects of &s;o much con&s;equence, that it was the opinion of per&s;ons the mo&s;t conver&s;ant in American bu&s;ine&s;s, that this attempt ought to have been made much earlier; and that if &s;uch an attempt made at &s;uch a time had &s;ucceeded, it would have contributed very much to the &s;ecu|rity of tho&s;e parts of our colonies which were the mo&s;t expo&s;ed, and would have at the &s;ame time greatly facilitated all our offen&s;ive mea&s;ures, and &s;hortened the war.</P>
<P>From the time that the French were acquainted with this place, they were fully po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with an o|pinion of its importance, both with regard to commerce and to domi|nion They made &s;everal attempts to e&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves here; but the Indians, who &s;eemed more &s;en&s;ible of the con&s;equences than we were, con&s;tantly oppo&s;ed it. They obli|ged them to relinqui&s;h a fort which they had built, and guarded this &s;pot for a long time with a very &s;e|vere and prudent jealou&s;y.</P>
<P>But whil&s;t we neglected, confi|ding in our &s;trength, to cultivate the Indians, and the French &s;en&s;ible of their weakne&s;s, omitted no endea|vour to gain the&s;e &s;avage people to
<PB N="109" REF="122">
their intere&s;ts, and they prevailed at la&s;t, under the name of a trading hou&s;e, to erect a &s;trong fort at the mouth of the &s;treight, on the very be&s;t harbour, not only on this but on any of the lakes; an harbour which is &s;afe from every wind, and open for the whole year. A French officer, an able and enterpri&s;ing man, had been a pri&s;oner among the Iroquois for a long time, and having, according to their cu&s;tom, been naturali&s;ed, he grew extreme|ly popular among&s;t them, and at la&s;t acquired his liberty. He com|municated to the then governor of Canada, the plan of an e&s;tabli&s;h|ment at Niagara, and he him&s;elf undertook to execute it. He re|turned among&s;t the Iroquois, and pretending great love for their na|tion, which was now his own, told them that he would gladly come to make frequent vi&s;its to his brethren; but it was proper for that purpo&s;e, that they &s;hould allow him to build an hou&s;e, where he might live at ea&s;e, and according to his own manner: at the &s;ame time he pro|po&s;ed to them advantages in trade from this e&s;tabli&s;hment. A reque&s;t which &s;eemed a compliment to tho&s;e to whom it was made, was readily granted. The hou&s;e was built. By degrees this hou&s;e ex|tended it&s;elf; it was &s;trengthened by various additions; and it grew at la&s;t to a regular fortre&s;s, which has ever &s;ince awed the Five Nations, and checked our colonies.</P>
<P>The &s;iege of this place had not been long formed <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 20.</NOTE> before general Prideaux was killed in the trenches by the bur&s;ting of a cohorn. As &s;oon as this accident happened, which threatened to throw a damp on the operations, an expre&s;s was &s;ent to General Am|her&s;t, who always attentive to the &s;ervice, lo&s;t no time to &s;end an officer of character to command in his place. But the command which in the interim devolved upon Sir William John&s;on, could not have been better be&s;towed. He omitted nothing to continue the vigorous mea&s;ures of the late general, and added to them every thing his own genius could &s;ugge&s;t. Re&s;pected by the regular troops, dear to the provincials, almo&s;t adored by the Indians, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that genius for acquiring popularity among&s;t all kinds of men, and that ver&s;atile di&s;po&s;ition, which we &s;o &s;eldom &s;ee united with di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s and integrity, he employed tho&s;e talents &s;olely for the benefit of his country. The troops remembering that it was under that general, the fir&s;t advantage had been obtained over the French, pu&s;hed on the &s;iege with &s;o much alacrity, that in a few days they had brought their approaches within an hundred yards of the covered way.</P>
<P>The French were alarmed at the imminent danger of this intere&s;ting place. They therefore collected all the regular troops and provincials, which they could draw from all their po&s;ts about the lakes, and to tho&s;e joined a large body of &s;avages, in order to give the Engli&s;h battle, and to rai&s;e the &s;iege. They amount|ed in all to 1700 men.</P>
<P>When General John&s;on was ap|prized of their approach, he order|ed his light in&s;antry, &s;upported by &s;ome grenadiers and regular foot, to take po&s;t on the road to his left, by which the French were to take their route. He placed his Indians on his flanks. Whil&s;t he took mea|&s;ures to receive the French, who came to relieve the place, he po&s;ted
<PB N="110" REF="123">
a &s;trong body in &s;uch a manner, as to &s;ecure his trenches from any at|tempt of the garri&s;on during an engagement.</P>
<P>In this di&s;po&s;ition he waited to receive the ene|my. <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 1.</NOTE> At nine in the morning the engagement began by a violent and horrid &s;cream of the enemies &s;avages, according to their barba|rous cu&s;tom. It was this &s;cream, perhaps the mo&s;t horrid &s;ound that can, be imagined, which is &s;aid to have &s;truck a panick into the troops of General Braddock, and was one of the principal cau&s;es of that de|feat, by which our endeavours in America were &s;o long fru&s;trated; but on this occa&s;ion it had no effect. The enemy was &s;o well received by the troops in front, and by the Indians on their flanks, that in le&s;s than an hour's time their whole army was ruined. The pur&s;uit was hot and bloody; and it continued for five miles. Seventeen officers were made pri&s;oners, among whom were the fir&s;t and &s;econd in com|mand.</P>
<P>This action was fought in &s;ight of the fort; and <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 25.</NOTE> it was no &s;ooner concluded in favour of our troops, than the general &s;ummoned the garri&s;on to &s;urrender; &s;ending in a li&s;t of the pri&s;oners, and remon&s;trating on the ill effects of their holding out longer, particularly with regard to the Indians. The capitulation was &s;igned that night. The garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting of about 600 men, &s;ur|rendered pri&s;oners of war, and were conducted to New-York. The fort and &s;tores were given up to the Engli&s;h troops.</P>
<P>This was the &s;econd very im|portant &s;ervice performed by Ge|neral John&s;on in this war, and a &s;econd time he had the good fortune to make the commander in chief of the enemy his pri|&s;oner. It mu&s;t not be omitted to the honour of this gentleman, that though he was not regularly bred a &s;oldier, the mo&s;t compleat officer could not have made more excellent di&s;po&s;itions for the battle, or have conducted the &s;iege from the beginning to the end, with a more cool and &s;teady re&s;olution, or with a more compleat knowledge of all the nece&s;&s;ary manoeuvres of war. The taking of Niagara broke off effectually that communication, &s;o much talked of and &s;o much dreaded, between Canada and Loui&s;iana, and by this &s;troke, one of the capital political de&s;igns of the French, which gave occa|&s;ion to the pre&s;ent war, was de|feated in its direct and immediate object.</P>

<P>THE con&s;equences which at|tended the reduction of the fort of Niagara, as well as tho&s;e upon Lake Champlain, were very intere&s;ting; but the great and cen|tral operation to which all the re&s;t tended, and to which even tho&s;e were to be only &s;ub&s;ervient, was that again&s;t Quebec, the capital of Canada; and as this was to be the deci&s;ive &s;troke, it was proper that the greate&s;t force &s;hould have been employed again&s;t it. If we reckon the maritime force, there is no doubt that we employed a greater number of men again&s;t Quebec, than again&s;t the Champlain forts; but the land forces, from &s;ome cau&s;e, fell much &s;hort of the num|ber originally propo&s;ed, for they did not exceed 7000 men, regu|lars and provincials, though the original plan intended 9000 for that expedition, independent of the junction of tho&s;e under General Amher&s;t, who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance on the occa&s;ion was taken for granted. In this expedition General Wolfe com|manded the land forces. The fleet was under Admiral Saunders.</P>
<P>The whole embarkation <NOTE PLACE="marg">26th.</NOTE> arrived in the latter end of June at the I&s;le of Orleans, a few leagues from Quebec, without any accident what&s;oever, notwith&s;tand|ing the ill fame of the river St. Laurence, and the reports of its dangerous navigation, probably &s;pread for political purpo&s;es. They landed upon the I&s;le of Orleans, which is formed by the branches of the river St. Laurence. This i&s;land is about twenty miles in length, and &s;even or eight in breadth, highly cultivated, and affording every kind of refre&s;hment to the &s;oldiers and &s;ailors after their tedious voyage.</P>
<P>As this i&s;land extends quite up to the ba&s;on of Quebec, it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to po&s;&s;e&s;s it in order to act again&s;t the town; for the mo&s;t we&s;terly point of this i&s;land ad|vances towards an high point of land on the continent, called Point Levi. Both of the&s;e &s;hut up the view of the northern and &s;outhern channel, which environ the i&s;le of Orleans, &s;o that the harbour of Quebec appears to be a ba&s;on land|locked upon all &s;ides. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of both the&s;e points were nece&s;&s;ary, as they might be employed either with great advantage again&s;t the town, or much to the annoyance of the be&s;iegers; for whil&s;t the enemy continued ma&s;ters of tho&s;e, it was impo&s;&s;ible for a &s;hip to lie in the harbour of Quebec. When the&s;e po&s;ts were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, which was done with little difficulty, the harbour and town of Quebec ap|peared full to the view, at once a tempting and a di&s;couraging &s;ight.
<PB N="112" REF="125">
For no place &s;eems po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of greater benefits of nature; nor none of which nature &s;eems more to have con&s;ulted the defence.</P>
<P>Quebec, &s;ays F. Charlevoix, can boa&s;t of a fre&s;h water harbour, ca|pable of containing an hundred men of war of the line, at one hun|dred and twenty leagues di&s;tance from the &s;ea. It lies on the mo&s;t navigable river in the univer&s;e. The river St. Laurence up to the I&s;le of Orleans, that is for about a hun|dred and twelve leagues from its mouth, is no where le&s;s than from four to five leagues broad; but above that i&s;le it narrows, &s;o that before Quebec it is not above a mile over. Hence this place got the name of Quebeis or Quebec, which, in the Algonquin tongue, &s;ignifies a &s;trait.</P>
<P>The city is the &s;eat of the go|vernor and the intendant, and the &s;upreme tribunals of ju&s;tice for all the French North America; it is al&s;o an epi&s;copal &s;ee, and a place of con&s;iderable trade. It is large in extent, and elegant in many of its buildings both public and pri|vate. It con&s;i&s;ts of an upper and lower town; the lower, which is narrow, is built upon a &s;trand, at the foot of a lofty rock, upon which the upper town &s;tands. This rock extends it&s;elf, and continues with a bold and &s;teep front, we&s;tward along the river St. Laurence for a con&s;iderable way. Another river from the north-we&s;t, called St. Charles, falls here into the former, wa&s;hing the foot of the rock on which Quebec &s;tands; the point on which the town is built thus be|comes a &s;ort of penin&s;ula by the junction of the&s;e rivers; &s;o that whoever attacks Quebec, mu&s;t ei|their make his approaches above the town, and overcome the precipice which I have mentioned, or cro&s;s the river St. Charles, and attempt it upon that &s;ide. The former of tho&s;e methods mu&s;t appear to a prudent commander wholly unad|vi&s;eable, and the latter extremely difficult. If the former method &s;hould be attempted they would have that dangerous precipice to overcome, defended by the enemies whole force, which the attack would draw to this quarter. On the other hand the country from the river St. Charles to the northward, for more than five miles, is ex|tremely rough, broken and diffi|cult, full of rivulets, gullies, and ravines, and &s;o continues to the river of Montmorenci, which flows by the foot of a &s;teep and woody hill. On the &s;ide of the river St. Laurence is a bank of &s;and of great extent, which prohibits the ap|proach of any con&s;iderable ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>In this advantageous &s;ituation was the French army po&s;ted, upon what was deemed the only ac|ce&s;&s;ible &s;ide of Quebec, all along from the river St. Charles to that of Montmorenci, entrenched at every attackable &s;pot, with the river and &s;andbank above-mention|ed in their front, and thick impe|netrable woods upon their rear. It is impo&s;&s;ible to imagine a &s;tronger po&s;t; a po&s;t at once more defen&s;ible in it&s;elf, or better calculated for &s;uc|couring the city, on which &s;ide &s;oever it &s;hould be attacked. Thus po&s;ted, they greatly exceeded in number the be&s;iegers, being about ten thou&s;and men, under an able, and hitherto fortunate commander, M. de Montcalm, who, though he was &s;uperior in number to the En|gli&s;h, re&s;olved to ri&s;que nothing, and wi&s;ely relied on the natural &s;trength of the country.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="126">
When Wolfe &s;aw the &s;ituation of the town, the nature of the country, the number of the troops, and their po&s;ition, though of a &s;anguine tem|per and highly adventurous, he began to de&s;pair; but, however another commander might have thought in|action in &s;uch circum&s;tances ju&s;tified to him&s;elf, or even to the world, by &s;uch &s;trong appearances, Wolfe re|&s;olved to leave nothing unattempted, but amid&s;t the choice of difficulties which lay before him, to pitch upon tho&s;e where the valour of his troops might be employed with the be&s;t pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he had &s;ecured the we&s;t point of the i&s;le of Orleans, and that of Levi, he erected batteries there of cannon and mortars, on the high ground, from the point of Levi, which looks towards the town; the&s;e fired continually upon the place; Admiral Saunders was &s;tationed be|low in the north channel of the i&s;le of Orleans, oppo&s;ite to Montmorenci; Admiral Holmes was &s;tationed a|bove the town, at once to di&s;tract the enemies attention, and to prevent any attempts from the enemy again&s;t the batteries that played upon the town.</P>
<P>After this wi&s;e di&s;po&s;ition was made of the fleet, General Wolfe cau&s;ed the troops to be tran&s;ported over the north channel of the river St. Lau|rence, to the north-ea&s;t of Montmo|renci, with a view of pa&s;&s;ing that ri|ver, and bringing the enemy to an engagement. Some heights which commanded the enemies intrench|ments, and a ford above, and another below the falls, encouraged him to this attempt; but, upon reconnoitring the ground, the oppo&s;ite &s;hore was found &s;o &s;teep and woody, that he could not hope to put his de&s;ign in execution, which was by moving to|wards the enemies flank, to draw them to an engagement. To bring the French to an action was his &s;ingle ob|ject. He had found that any attempts to a&s;&s;ault the city would prove to no purpo&s;e, whil&s;t the fleet could only batter the lower town, and mu&s;t &s;uf|fer greatly by the cannon and bombs of the upper, whil&s;t they were em|ployed in this ineffectual &s;ervice; for after the reduction of the lower town, the pa&s;&s;ages to the upper were ex|tremely &s;teep, and moreover &s;o well entrenched, that this advantage would prove little towards the reduction of the place.</P>
<P>The only point left therefore, was by every means to entice or force the enemy to an engagement; and to this end no means were omitted, by &s;ending detachments up the ri|ver, and by every appearance of a de&s;ign to attack the town on that &s;ide. But the Marquis de Montcalm, in chu&s;ing his po&s;t, was well ap|pri&s;ed of its importance. He knew &s;ufficiently the nature of the coun|try up the river, and he tru&s;ted to it; and therefore kept him&s;elf clo&s;e|ly in his po&s;t, di&s;po&s;ing his parties of &s;avages, in which he was very &s;trong, in &s;uch a manner, as to make any attempt upon him by &s;urprize ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible. In the mean time, from the town, fire&s;hips and boats were let down the &s;tream to de&s;troy the &s;hipping, which, as they almo&s;t wholly filled the channel, were greatly endangered. But by the extraordinary &s;kill and vigilance of Admiral Saunders, every ve&s;&s;el of this kind &s;ent again&s;t them was towed a&s;hore without doing the lea&s;t mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>The general finding that all his efforts to decoy the enemy to an en|gagement had proved un&s;ucce&s;sful, and, &s;en&s;ible that they de&s;ired no|thing more than to act defen&s;ively,
<PB N="114" REF="127">
until the &s;ea&s;on it&s;elf &s;hould fight for them and oblige the Engli&s;h to re|tire, he came at la&s;t, in &s;pite of all difficulties, to the re&s;olution of at|tacking them in their entrenchments on the &s;ide of Montmorenci. The place where the attack was to be made, was cho&s;en with great judge|ment, as the only place thereabouts in which the artillery could be brought into u&s;e; as there, and there only, the greate&s;t part, or even the whole of the troops, might act at once, and that there the retreat in ca&s;e of a repul&s;e was &s;ecure, at lea&s;t for a certain time of the tide. Having determined upon the place where the attack was to be, which was at the mouth of the river Mont|morenci, the be&s;t di&s;po&s;itions for it <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 30.</NOTE> were made, both on the part of the admiral and of the general. But notwith&s;tanding that the whole was conducted with equal vigour and prudence, it was totally defeated by one of tho&s;e ac|cidents which &s;o frequently interpo&s;e to the di&s;grace of human wi&s;dom, and which demon&s;trates that &s;he is far from being the &s;ole arbitre&s;s of war.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h grenadiers, who led the attack, had orders, immediately after their landing, to form them|&s;elves on the beach; but in&s;tead of forming them&s;elves as they were di|rected, from the hurry and noi&s;e of their landing, or from an ill-govern|ed ardor, they ru&s;hed impetuou&s;ly towards the enemies entrenchments in the utmo&s;t di&s;order and confu&s;ion, without waiting for the corps which were to &s;u&s;tain them, and join in the attack. In this di&s;order, they were met by a violent and &s;teady fire from the entrenchments, by which they were thrown into more confu|&s;ion, and obliged them to &s;helter them&s;elves behind a redoubt, which the French had abandoned on their approach.</P>
<P>The general perceiving that it was impo&s;&s;ible for the&s;e grenadiers to form under &s;o &s;evere a fire, that the night drew on, a violent tempe&s;t was gathering, and the tide began to make, &s;aw clearly that he had no|thing further left, than to order a retreat, with as little di&s;advantage as po&s;&s;ible. He therefore called off tho&s;e troops, and having formed them behind Brigadier Monkton's corps, which was on the beach in excellent order, the whole repa&s;&s;ed the river without mole&s;tation, the general expo&s;ing his per&s;on with that intrepidity, which di&s;tingui&s;hed him both during the attack, and the re|treat.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s in this check was not incon&s;iderable; and the event on the whole was &s;uch, as to di&s;cou|rage any further attempts upon that &s;ide. They returned to the old mea&s;ures. The general again &s;ent &s;ome bodies above the town, and &s;ome men of war &s;ailed up the &s;tream for more than twelve leagues. They received intelligence that the enemy had ama&s;&s;ed &s;ome magazines of provi&s;ions in the interior country, and they propo&s;ed by getting be|tween them and the town, to draw the French army from their entrench|ments, to the long-de&s;ired engage|ment; but if they failed to compa&s;s this, they might at lea&s;t de&s;troy the &s;hips of war which the enemy had in the river, and help to open a com|munication between them and Gene|ral Amher&s;t, on whom their la&s;t ex|pectations were fixed, and who, they flattered them&s;elves, was on his march to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>But though they &s;ucceeded in de|&s;troying &s;ome of the enemies maga|zines, there was nothing of great mo|ment
<PB N="115" REF="128">
in this. They could not come near the men of war. However they received intelligence from &s;ome pri&s;oners, of the &s;ucce&s;s of Sir Wil|liam John&s;on again&s;t Niagara; they learned likewi&s;e, that the French had &s;moothed the difficulties in the way of General Amher&s;t, by abandoning Crown Point and Ticonderoga. But this intelligence, otherwi&s;e &s;o plea&s;|ing, brought them no pro&s;pect of the approach of any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from that quarter. The &s;ea&s;on wa&s;ted apace. The general fell violently ill, con&s;umed by care, watching, and a fatigue, too great to be &s;upported by a delicate con&s;titution, and a body unequal to that vigorous and enterpri&s;ing &s;oul that it lodged. It was not enough for him to e&s;cape from &s;o great an expedition uncon|demned and unapplauded; to be pitied, was he thought but a milder cen&s;ure; and he knew that no mili|tary conduct can &s;hine, unle&s;s it be gilded with &s;ucce&s;s. His own high notions, the public hope, the good &s;ucce&s;s of other commanders, all turned inward upon him, op|pre&s;&s;ed his &s;pirits, and converted di&s;appointment into di&s;ea&s;e. As &s;oon as he had a little recovered, he di&s;|patched an expre&s;s with an account of his proceedings to England, writ|ten indeed in the &s;tile of de&s;ponden|cy, but with &s;uch per&s;picuity, clear|ne&s;s, and elegance, as would have ranked him among our be&s;t writers, if his military exploits had not placed him among our greate&s;t com|manders.</P>
<P>He re&s;olved, when he &s;ent away his account, to continue the cam|paign to the la&s;t po&s;&s;ible moment; and after a deliberation with his offi|cers, determined, that any further attempts at Montmorenci were to little purpo&s;e, and that their princi|pal operations &s;hould be above the town, in order, if po&s;&s;ible, to draw the enemy to an action. But the de&s;ign of Wolfe was deeper, and more particularly directed than it had been before. The camp at Mont|morenci was broke up, and the troops were conveyed to the &s;outh|ea&s;t of the river, and encamped at Point Levi. The &s;quadron under Admiral Holmes made movements up the river for &s;everal days &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively, in order to draw the enemies attention as far from the town as po&s;&s;ible. This &s;ucceeded in &s;ome mea&s;ure; for, though it could not per&s;uade the Marquis de Montcalm to quit his po&s;t, it induced him to detach M. de Bougainville with 1500 men to watch their motions, and to proceed along the we&s;tern &s;hore of the river, whil&s;t the Engli&s;h army di|rected its march the &s;ame way on the ea&s;tern bank.</P>
<P>When General Wolfe &s;aw that matters were ripe for action, he or|dered the &s;hips under Admiral Saun|ders to make a feint, as if they pro|po&s;ed to attack the French in their entrenchments, on the Beauport &s;hore below the town, and by their motions to give this feint all the appearance of a reality which it po&s;&s;ibly could have. This di&s;po&s;ition being made below the town, the general em|barked his forces about one in the morning, and with Admiral Holmes's divi&s;ion went three leagues further up the river than the intended place of his landing, in order to amu&s;e the enemy, and conceal his real de&s;ign. Then he put them into boats, and fell down &s;ilently with the tide, un|ob&s;erved by the French centinels po&s;ted along the &s;hore. The rapi|dity of the current carried the&s;e boats a little below the intended place of attack. The &s;hips followed
<PB N="116" REF="129">
them, and arrived ju&s;t at the time which had been concerted to cover their landing. Con&s;idering the dark|ne&s;s of the night, and the rapidity of the current, this was a very critical operation, and it required excellent heads both on the part of the marine, and the land &s;ervice, to pre&s;erve a communication, and to prevent a di&s;covery and confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>As the troops could not land at the &s;pot propo&s;ed, when they were put on &s;hore an hill appeared before them extremely high and &s;teep in its a&s;cent; a little path winded up this a&s;cent, &s;o narrow that two could not go abrea&s;t. Even this path was in|trenched, and a captain's guard de|fended it. The&s;e difficulties did not abate the hopes of the general, or the ardor of the troops. The light infantry under Colonel Howe laying hold of &s;tumps and boughs of trees, pulled them&s;elves up, di&s;lodged the guards, and cleared the path; and then all the troops &s;urmounting every difficulty, gained the top of the hill, and as fa&s;t as they a&s;cended formed them&s;elves, &s;o that they were all in order of battle at day break.</P>
<P>Montcalm when he heard that the Engli&s;h had a&s;cended the hill, and were formed on <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 13.</NOTE> the high ground at the back of the town, &s;carcely credited the intelli|gence, and &s;till believed it to be a feint to induce him to abandon that &s;trong po&s;t, which had been the ob|ject of all the real attempts that had been made &s;ince the beginning of the campaign. But he was &s;oon, and fatally for him, undeceived. He &s;aw clearly that the Engli&s;h fleet and army were in &s;uch a &s;ituation, that the upper and lower town might be attacked in concert, and that nothing but a battle could po&s;&s;ibly &s;ave it. Accordingly he determined to give them battle, and quitting Beauport pa&s;&s;ed the river St. Charles, and formed his troops oppo&s;ite to ours.</P>
<P>He filled the bu&s;hes that were in his front with detachments of Indians and his be&s;t mark&s;men, to the num|ber of about 1500; his regular forces formed his left; his right was compo&s;ed of the troops of the colony, &s;upported by two battalions of regu|lars. The re&s;t of the Indians and Canadians extended on that &s;ide, and attempted to outflank the left of the Engli&s;h, which was formed to pre|vent that de&s;ign, in a manner which the military men call <HI>Potence;</HI> that is, in a body which pre&s;ents two faces to the enemy. Here Brigadier General Town&s;hend commanded &s;ix regiments, and the Loui&s;bourg gre|nadiers were di&s;po&s;ed in a line to the right of this body, extending to the river. A regiment was drawn up behind the right for a re&s;erve. It was formed in eight &s;ubdivi&s;ions with large intervals. The light in|fantry under Colonel Howe protected the rear and the left. The di&s;po&s;i|tions on both &s;ides were judicious, and the engagement on both &s;ides began with &s;pirit.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h troops were exhorted to re&s;erve their fire; and they bore that of the enemies light troops in front, which was galling, though ir|regular, with the utmo&s;t patience and good order, waiting for the main body of the enemy, which advanced fa&s;t upon them. At forty yards di&s;tance our troops gave their fire, which took place in its full extent, and made a terrible havoc among the French. It was &s;upported with as much vivacity as it was begun, and the enemy every where yielded to it; but ju&s;t in the moment when the fortune of the field began to declare it&s;elf, General Wolfe, in who&s;e life every thing &s;eemed in|cluded,
<PB REF="130" MS="Y">

fell: General Monkton, the next to him in command, fell im|mediately after, and both were con|veyed out of the line; the com|mand now devolved on General Town&s;hend. It was at a very critical time. For, though the enemy be|gan to fall back, and were much broken, the lo&s;s of the two generals was a very di&s;couraging circum&s;tance, and it required great temper and great exertions to &s;upport the advan|tages that had been gained, and to pu&s;h them to their proper extent. General Town&s;hend &s;hewed him&s;elf equal to &s;o arduous a duty; the troops pre&s;erved their &s;pirit, and each corps &s;eemed to exert it&s;elf with a view to its peculiar character. The grenadiers with their bayonets, the Highlanders with their broad &s;words, and the re&s;t of the forces, with a &s;teady and continued fire, drove the enemy in great di&s;order from every po&s;t, and compleated their defeat. During the whole action, Colonel Howe with his light infantry covered the left wing in &s;uch a manner, as entirely to fru&s;trate the attempts of the enemies Indians and Canadians upon that flank.</P>
<P>The field now &s;eemed to be com|pleatly decided, when a new enemy appeared, which threatened to bring on a fre&s;h engagement, and to put all again to the hazard. M. de Bougainville, whom the feigned movements of the Engli&s;h troops had drawn up the river, turned back on di&s;covering their real de&s;ign, and now appeared on the rear of the army, with a body of 2000 men. But fortunately the main body of the French was by this time &s;o broken and di&s;per&s;ed, that the general was able to e&s;tabli&s;h his rear, and to turn &s;uch an oppo&s;ition on that &s;ide, that the enemy retired after a very feeble attempt.</P>
<P>In this deci&s;ive action our troops lo&s;t about 500 men; on the &s;ide of the enemy at lea&s;t 1500 were killed. But however glorious this victory was, and however important in its con&s;equences, it mu&s;t be admitted that it was very dearly bought. Soldiers may be rai&s;ed; officers will be formed by experience; but the lo&s;s of a genius in war, is a lo&s;s which we know not how to repair. The death of Wolfe was indeed grievous to his country, but to him&s;elf the mo&s;t happy that can be imagined; and the mo&s;t to be envied by all tho&s;e who have a true reli&s;h for mi|litary glory. Unindebted to family, or connections, un&s;upported by in|trigue or faction, he had accom|pli&s;hed the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of life at a time, when others are only begin|ning to appear; and at the age of thirty-five, without feeling the weak|ne&s;s of age or the vici&s;&s;itude of for|tune, having &s;atisfied his hone&s;t am|bition, having compleated his cha|racter, having fulfilled the expecta|tions of his country, he fell at the head of his conquering troops, and expired in the arms of victory.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances that attended the death of &s;uch a per&s;on, are too intere&s;ting to be pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence, and they were indeed &s;uch as &s;poke the whole tenor of his life. He fir&s;t received a wound in the head; but, that he might not di&s;courage his troops, he wrapped it up in his kandkerchief, and en|couraged his men to advance; &s;oon after he received another ball in his belly; this al&s;o he di&s;&s;embled, and exerted him&s;elf as before; when he received a third in his brea&s;t, under which he at la&s;t &s;unk, and &s;uffered him&s;elf, unwillingly, to be carried behind the ranks. As he lay &s;trug|gling with the angui&s;h and weakne&s;s
<PB N="118" REF="132">
of three grievous wounds, he &s;eemed only &s;ollicitous about the fortune of the battle. He begged one, who attended him, to &s;upport him to view the Field; but as he found that the approach of death had dimmed and confu&s;ed his &s;ight, he de&s;ired an officer, who was by him, to give him an account of what he &s;aw. The officer an&s;wered, that the enemy &s;eemed broken; he repeated his que&s;tion a few minutes after with much anxiety, when he was told that the enemy was totally routed, and that they fled in all parts. Then, &s;aid he, "I am &s;atisfied;" and imme|diately he expired.</P>
<P>Without the &s;ame advantages, the enemy al&s;o had an heavy lo&s;s in this battle, which, no doubt, contri|buted to their defeat. M. de Mont|calm, commander in chief, was kil|led on the &s;pot; an officer who had done the highe&s;t &s;ervices to his coun|try throughout the whole American war, and perfectly &s;upported his re|putation in this la&s;t &s;cene of it, hav|ing made the mo&s;t perfect di&s;po&s;itions that human prudence could &s;ugge&s;t, both before the battle and in the en|gagement. It is &s;omething remark|able that in both armies, the fir&s;t in command &s;hould be killed, and the &s;econd dangerou&s;ly wounded. But General Monkton happily recovered, the French officer died a little after the battle.</P>
<P>Five days after the action, the enemy &s;eeing that the communica|tion <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 18.</NOTE> between the town and the army was cut off, and that the Engli&s;h fleet and troops were preparing with all vi|gour for a &s;iege, &s;urrendered the city of Quebec upon terms of ho|nour to the garri&s;on, and advantage to the inhabitants, who were pre|&s;erved in the free exerci&s;e of their religion, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their civil rights, until a general peace &s;hould decide their future condition. The fortifications of the city were in tolerable order; the hou&s;es almo&s;t totally demoli&s;hed. A garri&s;on of 5000 men under General Murray, were put into the place, with a plen|ty of provi&s;ions and ammunition for the winter. The fleet &s;ailed to Eng|land &s;oon after, fearing le&s;t the &s;etting in of the fro&s;ts &s;hould lock them up in the river St. Laurence.</P>
<P>Thus the capital of French A|merica was rendered to the Engli&s;h, after a mo&s;t &s;evere campaign of near three months; and perhaps, if the whole be con&s;idered, there never was an enterpri&s;e of &s;uch difficulty carried on with a more gallant per&s;everance, or accompli&s;hed with more vigour and ability. A city &s;trong in &s;itua|tion and fortifications, was to be at|tacked. An army greatly &s;uperior in number to the be&s;iegers, was po&s;ted under the walls of that city in an impregnable &s;ituation. That army was to be forced to a battle a|gain&s;t the inclinations of a wi&s;e and cautious commander. A theatre of more than five leagues was to be fil|led, and operations of that extent to be carried on in the eye of the &s;uperior army, by le&s;s than 7000 men. In this conte&s;t with &s;o many difficulties, one may &s;ay with nature it&s;elf, the genius of the commander &s;hewed it&s;elf &s;uperior to every thing. All the di&s;po&s;itions to that daring but judicious attempt, near Sillery, which at la&s;t drew Montcalm from his entrenchments, were &s;o many ma&s;ter pieces in the art of war. But it is certain, that the&s;e things, not|with&s;tanding the extraordinary abi|lities of the general, could never have been compa&s;&s;ed, had not the marine co-operated with an unani|mity,
<PB N="119" REF="133">
diligence, and &s;kill, which never could have taken place, but from that perfect love to their country, that animated all tho&s;e that were concerned in this expe|dition. Here was no murmuring nor di&s;content, nor ab&s;urd jealou|&s;y; no mean competition between the land and &s;ea-&s;ervice; but the mo&s;t zealous endeavours to &s;econd each others efforts, and the mo&s;t generous inclinations on each &s;ide, to give a due prai&s;e to their mutual &s;ervices.</P>
<P>When the news of this deci&s;ive action arrived in England, we all remember, though it is very diffi|cult to de&s;cribe, the various and mixed emotions with which every one was affected. But two days before this came, was received the expre&s;s which General Wolfe had &s;ent off after the affair of Montmo|renci. When, the general doubted, the public thought they had rea&s;on to de&s;pair. But whil&s;t this gloom was fre&s;h and in the mid&s;t of the general de&s;pondency, a &s;econd ex|pre&s;s arrives, and brings all at once an account of the victory, the taking of Quebec, and the death of Gene|ral Wolfe. The effect of &s;o joyful news, immediately on &s;uch a dejec|tion, and then the mixture of grief and pity, which attended the public congratulations and applau&s;es, was very &s;ingular and affecting. The &s;ort of mourning triumph, that ma|nife&s;ted it&s;elf on that occa&s;ion, did equal honour to the memory of the general, and to the humanity of the nation.</P>
<P>A little circum&s;tance was talked of at that time, and it de&s;erves to be recorded, as it &s;hews a finene&s;s of &s;entiment, and a ju&s;tne&s;s of thinking, in the lower kind of people, that is rarely met with even among&s;t per&s;ons of education. The mother of General Wolfe was an object marked out for pity by great and peculiar di&s;tre&s;s; the pub|lic wound pierced her mind with a particular affliction, who had expe|rienced the dutiful &s;on, the ami|able dome&s;tic character, whil&s;t the world admired the accompli&s;hed officer. Within a few months &s;he had lo&s;t her hu&s;band; &s;he now lo&s;t this &s;on, her only child. The po|pulace of the village where &s;he lived unanimou&s;ly agreed to admit no illuminations or firings, or any other &s;ign of rejoycing what&s;oever near her hou&s;e, le&s;t they &s;hould &s;eem by an ill-timed triumph, to in&s;ult over her grief. There was a ju&s;tne&s;s in this, and whoever knows the people, knows that they made no &s;mall &s;acrifice on this oc|ca&s;ion.</P>
<P>The nation, which never &s;uffers any public &s;ervice to pa&s;s unre|warded, proceeded to honour the merits of the living and of the dead. The mini&s;ter him&s;elf made the motion for this purpo&s;e in the hou&s;e of commons, and all the force of eloquence was di&s;|played in &s;etting off the&s;e &s;ervices in their proper light. A magnifi|cent monument was voted for the decea&s;ed general in We&s;tmin&s;ter Ab|bey; the living generals and admi|rals received the greate&s;t of honours, the thanks of their country, by their repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>It is not known with certainty in what manner the French di&s;|po&s;ed of the remainder of their army after the battle of Quebec. It is probable that they retired to|wards Montreal and Trois Rivieres, the only places of any con&s;equence which they have left in Canada. In order to deprive them of &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence
<PB N="120" REF="134">
in any attempt they might be induced to make towards the recovery of Quebec in the winter, the country along the river was laid wa&s;te for a very con&s;iderable extent. A mea&s;ure, which for the &s;ake of humanity, we could have wi&s;hed not to have been found ne|ce&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the operations were thus &s;ucce&s;sfully carried on in the river St. Laurence, General Amher&s;t was not wanting in his endeavours on the &s;ide of Lake Champlain. Though the retreat of the French from Crown Point and Ticonderoga had left him entirely ma&s;ter of Lake George, he found that the command of Lake Champlain was &s;till an ob|ject of &s;ome difficulty. Mr. Bourle|maque, who commanded in that part, had retired to the I&s;le de Noix, at the bottom of the lake, where he had three thou&s;and five hundred men &s;trongly entrenched; he had like|wi&s;e four &s;tout armed &s;loops, by which he could ea&s;ily defeat any at|tempt by boats.</P>
<P>General Amher&s;t found it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to attain a naval &s;uperiority upon the Champlain, before he could hope to pu&s;h his operations any further; but this was a work of &s;o much time, that it made it ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to attain the great end of the campaign, the communication with General Wolfe, who was left in the man|ner we have &s;een to the exertion of his &s;ingle &s;trength. The naval preparations were not perfectly ac|compli&s;hed before the 10th of October. They con&s;i&s;ted of a great radeau, eighty four feet in length, and twenty in breadth, which car|ried &s;ix twenty-four pounders; the re&s;t con&s;i&s;ted of a brigantine and a &s;loop.</P>
<P>Covered by the&s;e the army was embarked in <NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 11.</NOTE> boats in a mo&s;t excellent di&s;po&s;ition, and proceeded a con&s;iderable way upon the lake; but as the &s;ea&s;on was far advanced, and the wea|ther growing cold and tempe&s;tuous, he judged it highly dangerous to venture his troops much upon the water in open batteaux; for the waves run as high on this lake as at &s;ea in an hard gale of wind. Be&s;ides, he could not hope at this advanced &s;ea&s;on to act at &s;uch a di&s;tance as the I&s;le de Noix with any effect; he therefore wi&s;ely po&s;tponed his opera|tions on that &s;ide to another year, and contented him&s;elf for the pre|&s;ent with the efforts of his little ma|rine, which exerted it&s;elf with great activity; they blocked up two of the enemies &s;tronge&s;t ve&s;&s;els in a bay, but the French a|bandoned them in the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 15.</NOTE> night, and &s;unk them in a deep wa|ter, the crews making their e&s;cape; the&s;e they were in hopes to weigh up. The French appearing no where to oppo&s;e them, the arm|ed &s;loops returned to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 21.</NOTE> Crown Point &s;oon after the troops, which were di&s;po&s;ed in winter quarters.</P>
<P>The memorable and vigorous campaign of 1759, which made full amends for the inactivity of the former, was thus happily clo&s;ed. By the taking of Niagara, Ticon|deroga, and above all Quebec, the French, in the little remaining part of Canada, are inve&s;ted upon every &s;ide. The troops which they have under Mr. Levy at Montreal, and tho&s;e under Mr. Bourlemaque at I&s;le de Noix, can neither be re|cruited with men, nor properly &s;upplied with military &s;tores, all communication with France being cut off. So that in the opening of

the next campaign, if they are at|tacked with vigour from the &s;ide of Quebec, whil&s;t General Amher&s;t advances with his body by Lake Champlain, of which he has now the entire dominion, the re&s;i&s;tance will be no more than &s;ufficient to give reputation to the conque&s;t; and it will depend more upon our own &s;entiments of convenience what part of North America we &s;hall leave to France, than to any efforts they may make in that part of the world; happy if our Eu|ropean &s;y&s;tem &s;hould &s;o far concur, as to leave us free to conclude a peace in America upon its own me|rits.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. <HI>Prince Henry's march into Saxony. General Vehla defeated. King of Pru&s;&s;ia enters Saxony. Pru&s;&s;ians defeated at Maxen. Again defeated at Mei&s;&s;en. M. Daun occupies the camp at Pirna. Mun&s;ter &s;urrenders to the allies. Hereditary Prince of Brun&s;wick defeats the Duke of Wurtemburg at Fulda. March of the Hereditary Prince of Brun&s;wick to Saxony.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE took notice, in the preced|ing part of our narrative, of that movement of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, by which he got between the Ru&s;&s;ians and Great Glogau, and thereby baffled their de&s;ign upon that important place. This move|ment, at once daring, prudent and nece&s;&s;ary, hindered the Ru&s;|&s;ians from taking winter quarters in his dominions; but at the &s;ame time it unavoidably cut off all com|munication with the army of Prince Henry.</P>
<P>That Prince, &s;eeing that he could not &s;econd the operations of the King, his brother, on the &s;ide of Sile&s;ia, contrived another expedient of co-operating with him, which was immediately to direct his march towards Saxony. There was no object, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of which was more intere&s;ting; on that account it was very proper; but this march an&s;wered al&s;o another end; for it drew the attention of M. Daun to the &s;ide of Saxony, and di&s;abled him from a&s;&s;i&s;ting the de&s;igns of the Ru&s;&s;ians again&s;t Glogau, either with his whole army, or with any con&s;iderable detachment from it. The whole country of Lu&s;atia, through which this projected march lay, was in a manner over&s;pread with the enemy. M. Daun, with the main army of the Au&s;trians, lay at a place called Sorau, oppo&s;ite to the Prince's camp. Five bodies of Ru&s;&s;ians occupied as many ad|vantageous po&s;ts between the Bober and the Nei&s;s. General Laudohn po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the whole country along the Spree, with &s;everal Au&s;trian corps. To get round M. Daun, it was nece&s;&s;ary to make a va&s;t circuit, and to march between the Au&s;trian and Ru&s;&s;ian armies for more than &s;ixty Engli&s;h miles.</P>
<P>Before the Prince entered upon this arduous de&s;ign, by &s;everal bold movements he obliged M. Daun to retreat from Sorau to Gor|litz, and from Gorlitz as far as Bautzen, keeping him&s;elf as much as po&s;&s;ible between the Prince and Saxony. But his Royal Highne&s;s, having perceived the direction in which M. Daun was moving, made
<PB N="122" REF="138">
a compa&s;s to the northward of the Au&s;trians, into the Lower Lu&s;atia, pa&s;&s;ed the Nei&s;s at Rothenburg, and marching with the utmo&s;t expedi|tion arrived at Hoyers Werda in two days from his leaving his po&s;ts near Zittau. This <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 25.</NOTE> rapid march brought them quite un|expected upon a body of five or &s;ix thou&s;and Au&s;trian irregulars, com|manded by General Vehla, who were &s;ituated in all &s;ecurity behind the town. They were routed with no &s;mall &s;laughter. Having di&s;|lodged this corps, the Prince's army had lei&s;ure to repo&s;e them&s;elves af|ter &s;uch a fatiguing march, for two days; and then continued their pro|gre&s;s towards the Elbe, which river they cro&s;&s;ed at Torgau, hav|ing received notice that M. Daun <NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 2.</NOTE> had cro&s;&s;ed it before them near Dre&s;den. Thus was the grand theatre of the war once more trans|ferred into Saxony, and that mi&s;era|ble country, continually hara&s;&s;ed, continually to&s;&s;ed from hand to hand, the &s;port of violence and fortune, &s;uffered equal di&s;tre&s;&s;es from its deli|verers and its enemies.</P>
<P>The Pru&s;&s;ian army, from the be|ginning of this war, has been par|ticularly di&s;tingui&s;hed for its marches; and there is certainly nothing in all the various operations of war, which more particularly di&s;tingui&s;hes good troops, and able and &s;pirited leaders. But this march of Prince Henry, over &s;uch a tract of country, almo&s;t every where occupied by the enemy, in &s;o &s;hort a time, and with &s;o little lo&s;s, is perhaps one of the mo&s;t ex|traordinary, and the be&s;t conducted, of the marches that have been made by the Pru&s;&s;ian, or any other army.</P>
<P>This fortunate &s;troke, together with the retreat of the Ru&s;&s;ians, afforded &s;ome hope, that notwith|&s;tanding his repeated di&s;a&s;ters, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia might &s;till conclude the campaign to his advantage. The detachments under Finck and Wun&s;ch had no &s;ooner entered Mi&s;nia, than they attained a &s;uperio|rity over the united armies of Au|&s;tria and the empire; all the places which in &s;o &s;hort a time they had &s;eized, in as &s;hort a time were re|duced to the obedience of their for|mer ma&s;ters. Wun&s;ch had engaged their army, and defeated one of its wings. This victory gave them the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every thing to the gates of Dre&s;den, the only town which remained to the enemy of all tho&s;e they had taken. They found them|&s;elves unable to prevent Prince Henry from pa&s;&s;ing the Elbe; they found them&s;elves unable to prevent Gene|ral Hul&s;en from coming to his re|lief with a con&s;iderable detach|ment; they found them&s;elves un|able to prevent the King from joining him&s;elf to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 12.</NOTE> tho&s;e; when, after obliging the Ru&s;|&s;ians to evacuate Sile&s;ia, he marched to their relief, leaving General It|zenplitz, with a part of his army, to keep the Ru&s;&s;ians from availing them&s;elves of his ab&s;ence. On this the army of the empire retired. M. Daun fell back towards Dre&s;den. All the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's po&s;ts were left unmole&s;ted, and after all his lo&s;&s;es, and all his nece&s;&s;ary detach|ments, he &s;till &s;aw him&s;elf at the head of a gallant army of &s;ixty thou&s;and men, in high &s;pirits, and ready to execute the mo&s;t de&s;perate of his orders, notwith&s;tanding the advanced &s;ea&s;on, and the great ex|tremity of the cold.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="139">
It is true, that M. Daun was &s;u|perior to him in numbers, and yet more &s;o in &s;ituation. He could at any time take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fa|mous camp at Pirna, where he could not be attacked with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s; but then the freezing of the Elbe, the &s;now on the mountains which divide Bohemia from Saxony, and the continual mole&s;tations which might be expected from the Pru&s;&s;ian parties, made this &s;ituation as dan|gerous, in &s;ome re&s;pects, as it was de&s;irable in others.</P>
<P>It was the opinion of many, that the&s;e advantages on the &s;ide of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, well pur&s;ued with|out aiming at more, would in a &s;hort time infallibly have obliged M. Daun to relinqui&s;h his &s;trong po&s;t, and to retire into Bohemia, abandoning Dre&s;den, and with it all the fruits of his victorious campaign. But the King, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by an idea of the ill &s;ituation of the Au&s;trians, thought that advantages of greater moment, and more deci&s;ive, might be drawn from it. He knew, that the pa&s;&s;es into Bohemia were &s;o dif|ficult, that by &s;ome po&s;ts properly cho&s;en and &s;trongly guarded, the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the Au&s;trians might be made impracticable, and that even their retreat rendered &s;o difficult, that M. Daun would find him&s;elf compelled to fight at a di&s;advantage, and to put to the hazard of the field, all that his caution and prudence had been &s;o long and &s;o painfully procuring.</P>
<P>Upon this plan the King, having obliged M. Daun to retreat as far as Plauen, advanced him&s;elf as far as Ke&s;&s;eldorf; and ordered General Finck, with a &s;trong corps, to turn the Au&s;trians, and &s;eize the defiles of Maxen and Ottendorf, through which alone it &s;eemed po&s;&s;ible for the Au&s;trians to communicate with Bohemia. This was &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully executed, that there appeared no doubt that the King had effectual|ly &s;ecured one of his principal ob|jects, and had placed Daun between two fires.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the Pru&s;&s;ians enjoyed this &s;ecurity, M. Daun, who was aware of their de&s;ign, had &s;o occupied all the eminences about this rough and dangerous place, and all the pa&s;&s;es into it, that the Pru&s;&s;ians were hard|ly attacked, when their defeat &s;eem|ed inevitable. It is probable that they had got too far into the&s;e defiles, and had not taken proper mea&s;ures to &s;ecure a retreat, or any &s;ort of com|munication with the grand army. They became too late &s;en&s;ible of their &s;ituation, and they made, for a whole day, the mo&s;t intrepid efforts to di&s;engage them&s;elves from it; but they were foiled in every attempt, with con&s;iderable lo&s;s of men, and of the mo&s;t part of their artillery.</P>
<P>Night put a &s;top to the engage|ment; the Au&s;trians employed it ef|fectually, to entangle the Pru&s;&s;ians, by guarding with double &s;trength and vigilance, every avenue thro' which it was po&s;&s;ible for them to e&s;cape. So that when the morning appeared, they &s;aw the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 26.</NOTE> hills covered upon every &s;ide with great bodies of their enemies, and every defile pre&s;ented a wall of bayonets, through which it was im|po&s;&s;ible to penetrate. Thus galled with the lo&s;&s;es of the preceding day, in which it is &s;aid they had exhau&s;t|ed almo&s;t all their ammunition, &s;tripped of the greate&s;t part of their cannon, &s;urrounded by the enemy on all quarters, no re&s;ource, no pro|&s;pect of relief appearing, the army lo&s;t all hope, and all &s;pirit. To make any efforts in this condition,
<PB N="124" REF="140">
General Finck thought would only be to throw away unprofitably the lives of many brave men, which might be re&s;erved for a more hopeful occa&s;ion; he therefore, notwith&s;tand|ing the known rigour of his ma&s;ter, the apparent &s;hame of the thing, and the thou&s;and circum&s;tances of em|barra&s;ment that mu&s;t have ari&s;en to a man of honour at &s;uch a juncture, came to a re&s;olution of &s;urrendering the whole army pri&s;oners of war. Nineteen battalions and thirty-five &s;quadrons, compo&s;ing near twenty thou&s;and men by the Au&s;trian ac|count, above twelve by the Pru&s;&s;ian confe&s;&s;ion, &s;ixty-four pieces of can|non, many &s;tandards and colours were taken on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>It was unque&s;tionably the greate&s;t blow which the Pru&s;&s;ians had felt from the beginning of the war; con&s;idering the critical time, the numbers taken, and the lo&s;s of re|putation, which aro&s;e from the man|ner in which they were taken. It is no wonder, that &s;uch an extraordina|ry advantage, thus cheaply obtained, &s;hould greatly have elevated the friends of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. They had put the cheat upon the Pru&s;|&s;ians, they had caught their enemy in the very trap which they had laid, as they thought, with &s;uch addre&s;s for them. They had now received a full indemnification for the cap|ture of the Saxon army, which had &s;urrendered in much the &s;ame man|ner, and very near this place, in the year 1756.</P>
<P>The King of Pru&s;&s;ia had not time to recover from this &s;troke, under which he was yet &s;taggering, when he received another blow, and a &s;e|vere one. General Durceke was po&s;ted at the right of the Elbe, op|po&s;ite to Mei&s;&s;en; but on <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 4.</NOTE> the approach of a large bo|dy of Au&s;trians, they prepared to re|treat over the river into that place into which they thought their re|treat &s;ecure; but having been obli|ged by an hard fro&s;t to withdraw their bridge of boats, a thaw &s;uper|vening, when they attempted to lay a bridge of pontoons, &s;o many great fragments of ice floated in the river, that they found it impractica|ble; they were therefore under the nece&s;&s;ity of pa&s;&s;ing over their army in boats. Whil&s;t they &s;truggled with the&s;e difficulties, their rear guard was attacked by the Au&s;trians with great fury, and all the men that compo&s;ed it, together with the Ge|neral, were killed or made pri&s;oners. The lo&s;s of the Pru&s;&s;ians on this oc|ca&s;ion is &s;aid to have been three thou|&s;and killed and taken; and this &s;e|cond &s;urprize brought a new di&s;cre|dit, as well as a great detriment to the Pru&s;&s;ian arms.</P>
<P>M. Daun was not &s;o carried away with this flood of &s;ucce&s;s, as to de|part in the lea&s;t degree from his u&s;ual cautious management. Two advantages were now obtained, which, with a very few efforts, might be improved, to the entire de&s;truc|tion of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. At lea&s;t, many Generals would have thought &s;o; but M. Daun thought that the &s;ame conduct, which, with no ri&s;que, and with little lo&s;s, had reduced the King &s;o low, was the mo&s;t likely, if pur&s;ued, to bring on his entire ruin. He re&s;olved to give that monarch no &s;ort of chance to recover his fortune; Daun, after the two great victories of the Ru&s;|&s;ians his allies, after the two great victories he had him&s;elf newly ob|tained, retired behind Dre&s;den; and as if he had been beaten, as often as he was victorious, he took re&s;uge in the impregnable camp at Pirna,
<PB N="125" REF="141">
having &s;o di&s;po&s;ed matters, that the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, now too weak to &s;end out any great detachments, could not prevent his communication with Bohemia.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the King of Pru&s;&s;ia carried on his un&s;ucce&s;sful campaign in Saxony, through all the rigours of the &s;evere&s;t winter for many years felt in Europe; the army of the allies kept the field with better fortune. It is true, things had been &s;o di&s;po&s;ed by the ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;|tance of Mun&s;ter, and the reinforce|ments which arrived in the French army, that Prince Ferdinand did not find him&s;elf in a condition to force them to a deci&s;ive action; and there|fore the &s;ituation of the two armies had continued much the &s;ame for a con&s;iderable time. At length Mun&s;ter, after a &s;eries of opera|tions, &s;ometimes a &s;iege, &s;ometimes a blockade, now broken off, and now re&s;umed, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 20.</NOTE> at la&s;t &s;urrendered, and the garri&s;on capitulated for their liberty.</P>
<P>Not long after this, the Hereditary Prince of Brun&s;wick, all who&s;e en|terpri&s;es are di&s;tingui&s;hed with a pe|culiar eclat and &s;plendor, that mark them for his own, performed a &s;er|vice that curbed the French, even more than the lo&s;s of Mun&s;ter. Prince Charles of Bevern was al&s;o engaged in this de&s;ign.</P>
<P>The Duke of Wurtemburg had renewed his treaty of &s;ub&s;idy with France, and having recruited and augmented his troops, he lay at Fulda, a great way to the right of the French army. The Here|ditary Prince formed a de&s;ign to attack him at that di&s;tance.</P>
<P>On the 28th of November, taking a &s;mall, but well cho&s;en corps of hor&s;e and foot, and di&s;engaging them from their baggage, he arriv|ed in two days at Fulda, where the Wurtemburgers enjoyed them&s;elves in full &s;ecurity. A <HI>feu de joye</HI> had been ordered for that day; the troops were all in their be&s;t cloaths; the Duke had invited all the ladies in the town to his table, and to a ball, which he intended to have given that very day; but the Hereditary Prince di&s;concerted their mea&s;ures, both of war and diver&s;ion. A large party of the Wurtemburg troops were po&s;ted in a plain before the town. The Hereditary Prince fell upon them unawares in their front and flank, and drove them in|to the town, into which he clo&s;ely pur&s;ued them. Here they made &s;ome appearance of maintaining their ground for &s;ome minutes, but they were &s;oon drove out on the other &s;ide, and hotly pur&s;ued by the Prince of Brun&s;wick; without the town they were met by Prince Charles of Bevern who had made a compa&s;s about the place, and attack|ed them vigorou&s;ly as &s;oon as they had got out of it. Four battalions made &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance, and were all cut to pieces or made pri&s;oners; the re&s;t, with the Duke him&s;elf cover|ed by the re&s;i&s;tance of the&s;e bat|talions, made a &s;hift to e&s;cape. Above a thou&s;and pri&s;oners were made no this occa&s;ion; and the Prince returned to the camp of the allies, after having effectually di&s;|abled this corps from performing any thing con&s;iderable; and this ac|tion was of the greate&s;t con&s;equence, as, by the di&s;po&s;ition of that corps at Fulda, there was an appearance as if the French meant to form a communication with the army of the Empire, for the mutual exten&s;ion and &s;ecurity of their winter quarters.</P>
<P>This enterpri&s;e was only the per|lude to another, which promi&s;ed to be much more exten&s;ive in its con&s;e|quences.
<PB N="126" REF="142">
The &s;ea&s;on was now grown too &s;evere to &s;uffer the allies to pu&s;h any further the advantages they had obtained over the French; at the &s;ame time it di&s;abled the French from attempting any thing con&s;iderable again&s;t them. Be&s;ides the&s;e advantages of the &s;ea&s;on, by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing Mun&s;ter, the allies were no longer obliged to keep &s;o large a body of men in We&s;tphalia. The&s;e were the con&s;iderations which &s;uffered Prince Ferdinand to turn his eyes to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;tate of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's affairs. After the two great blows which that monarch had &s;uffered, there was no hope of di&s;|lodging M. Duan with his &s;ingle force; and he was utterly unable to avail him&s;elf as heretofore, of the rigour of the &s;ea&s;on, to &s;trike a deci&s;ive blow. Prince Firdinand, di&s;tant as he was from his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed ally, and &s;o near to an enemy &s;uperior in numbers, did not he&s;itate to &s;end him &s;uccours, to enable him, if po&s;&s;ible, to make a final effort. He detached there|fore 12,000 of his be&s;t men, and placed them under the command of the Hereditary Prince, with who&s;e vigour and diligence he was perfect|ly acquainted, and under whom he knew the &s;oldiers would endure any hard&s;hip with chearfulne&s;s. They marched from Kor&s;dorff, and in the depth of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 11.</NOTE> late &s;evere &s;ea&s;on, without lo&s;ing a man by &s;ickne&s;s or de&s;ertion, in fif|teen days, marched near three hun|der miles, and joined the King of Pru&s;&s;ia at Freybourg.</P>
<P>This junction rai&s;ed for a while the &s;pirits and hopes of the Pru&s;&s;ian army, but, in effect, it did more honour to the abilities of the Here|ditary Prince, than &s;ervice to the King. The &s;ea&s;on which fought equally again&s;t all &s;ides, the inacce&s;|&s;ible camp at Pirna, and the caution of M. Daun, rendered it impo&s;&s;ible to the King, notwith&s;tanding this re|inforcement, to make any attempt. So that after &s;everal movements in hopes of bringing the Au&s;trains to an engagement, he was obliged at length to de&s;i&s;t, and to &s;uffer the &s;hattered remains of his army to repo&s;e in winter quarters, after the fruitle&s;s fatigues of &s;o long, &s;o labo|rious, and &s;o bloody a campaign.</P>
<P>The King of Pru&s;&s;ia did not derive the benefits that were expected from this detachment; the French had no &s;ooner notice of it, than they at|tempted to avail them&s;elves of the weakne&s;s it cau&s;ed in the allied army. The Duke of Broglio was now at the head of the French troops; he had lately returned from Ver&s;ailles, having ruined the cha|racter of M. de Contades, e&s;tabli&s;h|ed his own, removed his rival, and, in &s;pite of &s;eniority, had acquired the mar&s;hal's &s;taff, and the command of the army. He thought he had now an opportuinty for an action of eclat to di&s;tingui&s;h his entrance into command. He attempted to attack Prince Ferdinand by &s;ur|pri&s;e. But finding him <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 24.</NOTE> perfectly prepared, and all his po&s;ts well guarded, he thought it mo&s;t prudent to retire to his former quar|ters; and with this abortive attempt clo&s;ed the operations of the German campaign, from whence France had entertained &s;uch &s;anguine hopes; leaving to Prince Ferdinand the glory of taking Mun&s;ter in the pre&s;ence of one of their armies, and of &s;ecuring his own po&s;ts again&s;t all their efforts, after he had, from an inferior num|ber, detached 12,000 men three hundred miles from his camp.</P>

Conclu&s;ion of the annals of</HI> 1759.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;everity of the winter could not put a &s;top to the operations of the land armies; it had no more effect upon the opera|tions at &s;ea, which went on with vigour, in &s;pite of the inclemency of the &s;ea&s;on. The inva&s;ion projected by France, which the engagement off Cape Lagos had retarded, was by no means laid a&s;ide.</P>
<P>The preparations for a naval equipment in the harbour of Bre&s;t, and for tran&s;porting a body of forces from Vannes, went on continually. The winter did not delay the&s;e pre|parations, becau&s;e it was hoped that in that &s;ea&s;on, the Briti&s;h fleet might be obliged to take refuge in their own harbours; and thus might afford on opportunity for the French fleet to come out unoppo&s;ed, and to execute the object of their de&s;tination before the Briti&s;h navy could be in readine&s;s to encounter them.</P>
<P>In fact, they were not wholly di&s;|appointed in their expectations. A violent &s;torm forced Sir Edward Hawke to quit his &s;tation off Bre&s;t. He came with his whole fleet to an|chor in Torbay.</P>
<P>The French fleet avail|ed it&s;elf of his ab&s;ence <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 14.</NOTE> to put to &s;ea. The whole Engli&s;h nation was alarmed; but it was an alarm which produced no hurry or di&s;turbance, but vigorous, cool, and &s;ettled methods for defence.</P>
<P>And now the event of the whole war was put to the i&s;&s;ue; for upon the good or ill &s;ucce&s;s of this &s;troke every thing depended. Admiral Hawke lo&s;t not <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 14.</NOTE> a moment's time to put again to &s;ea, and to &s;eek the French fleet. Both &s;quadrons put to &s;ea on the &s;ame day; Sir Edward Hawke from Torbay, M. de Conflans from Bre&s;t. There was a difference of but one &s;hip of the line in their forces.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible here to pa&s;s over the gallant behaviour of one of our Admirals, as it helps to mark the ge|nius and &s;pirit of this happy time, and as this is one of the fine&s;t in&s;tances of it. Admiral Saunders came into port from his Quebec expedition im|mediately after Hawke had &s;ailed. After &s;uch a long voyage and &s;o &s;e|vere a campaign, unbroken by fa|tigue, and &s;till in&s;atiated with glory, he determined immediately to &s;et &s;ail again, and partake the honour and danger of the coming engagement. For this purpo&s;e no time was to be lo&s;t, and he had no orders. But he thought the exigences of his country &s;ufficient orders; and he knew that at this time the letter of military di&s;|cipline would never be &s;et again&s;t its &s;pirit. He therefore &s;et &s;ail without waiting for orders with ten &s;hips; but fortune did not favour the gene|ro&s;ity of his intentions, and he did not join the Briti&s;h fleet time enough for the engagement.</P>
<P>As Sir Edward Hawke conclud|ed that the fir&s;t rendezvous of the enemy's fleet would be at Quiberon,
<PB N="128" REF="144">
he directed his cour&s;e with all dili|gence for that bay. But here again fortune for a while &s;eemed to declare for the French; for a &s;trong wind blown in an ea&s;terly point, drove the Engli&s;h fleet a great way to the we&s;t|ward; but at length it became more favourable, and bore them in directly to the &s;hore. About eight o'clock the headmo&s;t &s;hips di&s;covered the ene|my bearing to the northward, between the i&s;land of Bellei&s;le and the main land of France.</P>
<P>Hawke &s;aw at la&s;t what he had &s;o long, and &s;o ardently wi&s;hed for, (though hitherto in vain) the enemy in his reach. But yet there were &s;uch difficulties in his way, as would have checked a very cautious com|mander, or perhaps any commander in circum&s;tances le&s;s critical to the publick &s;afety. On the &s;lighte&s;t in|&s;pection of the chart it will appear, that all this &s;ea is &s;own thick with &s;ands and &s;hoals, and &s;hallows and rocks; our pilots were by no means well acquainted with it; and the wind blew little le&s;s than 2 violent &s;torm, and the waves ran mountain high. In the&s;e circum&s;tances they were to attack a very &s;trong &s;qua|dron of the enemy on their own coa&s;t, with which they were perfect|ly acquainted. All the&s;e difficulties only animated the Engli&s;h Admiral. In one of the fine&s;t &s;hips in the world, commanding the flower of the Briti&s;h navy, and &s;econded by &s;ome of the mo&s;t tried and brave&s;t officers in the &s;ervice; and above all not dubious of him&s;elf. He order|ed the &s;hips neare&s;t the enemy im|mediately to cha&s;e, and, by engag|ing them, to give time for the re&s;t of the fleet to come up.</P>
<P>M. Conflans had two choices, ei|ther to fly, or to &s;tand and fight it out. But he followed neither per|fectly; for &s;ome time he appeared as if he meant to fight; but after giving the Briti&s;h &s;hips time to come near him, when it was too late, he crouded all the &s;ail he could carry; at the &s;ame time he &s;hewed an atten|tion to keep all his &s;quadron toge|ther.</P>
<P>At half an hour after two, the ac|tion began with great fury. In two hours the enemy had lo&s;t three &s;hips of the line, one &s;truck, two were &s;unk outright. Hawke ordered his &s;hip to re&s;erve her fire, to pa&s;s by all the others, and to be laid along &s;ide of the Soleil Royal, the be&s;t &s;hip in the French navy, and commanded by M. de Conflans; the ma&s;ter re|mon&s;trated on the almo&s;t inevitable danger of the coa&s;t. Hawke an|&s;wered, <Q>&startq;You have done your duty in this remon&s;trance; now obey my orders, and lay me along &s;ide the French Admiral.&endq;</Q> A French &s;hip of 70 guns generou&s;ly put him|&s;elf between them; Hawke was obliged to be&s;tow here the fire he had re&s;erved for a greater occa&s;ion, and at one broad&s;ide &s;unk her to the bottom. The headmo&s;t of the Engli&s;h &s;hips fired on the enemy as they came up to them, and then pa&s;t on to others, leaving tho&s;e behind to improve their &s;ucce&s;s, and de&s;troy or take them; and by this method they had got up quite to the van of the enemy, and would have totally de&s;troyed their fleet, had not night interpo&s;ed to &s;ave them. Before night came on, the enemy's fleet was much di&s;per&s;ed; but in the eagerne&s;s of the pur&s;uit, two of the Engli&s;h &s;hips unfortunately run up|on a &s;and, called the Four, and were lo&s;t. The enemy fled in to their own coa&s;t. Seven &s;hips of the line threw overboard all their guns, and e&s;caped into the River Villaine;
<PB N="129" REF="145">
about as many more got out to &s;ea, and made for other ports.</P>
<P>Nothing could be conceived more dreadful than the night which &s;uc|ceeded this action. A violent &s;torm blew all night long. It was a pitchy darkne&s;s; a dangerous coa&s;t &s;ur|rounded them on almo&s;t all &s;ides. A continual firing of di&s;tre&s;s guns was heard, without knowing whether they came from friend or enemy; and on account of the badne&s;s of the coa&s;t and the darkne&s;s of the night, our people were equally unable to venture to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>When morning came on, they found the French Admiral had run his &s;hip, and another called the Heros, on &s;hore; the fir&s;t was &s;et on fire by the enemy, the other by our &s;eamen. Thus concluded this remarkable action, in which the French had four capital &s;hips de|&s;troyed, one taken, and the whole of their formidable navy, in which con&s;i&s;ted the la&s;t hope of their ma|rine, &s;hattered, di&s;armed, and di&s;|per&s;ed. The long threatened inva|&s;ion which was to repair their lo&s;&s;es in every part of the world, was di&s;|&s;ipated, and the credit of their arms broken along with their forces. The behaviour of the Engli&s;h cap|tains and &s;eamen, on the contrary, added as much to the glory of the Briti&s;h arms, as to the &s;afety of their country. Perhaps there never was a naval engagement of &s;uch extent, in which no captain was accu&s;ed, nor even in any degree &s;u&s;pected of mi&s;behaviour or cowardice; in which tho&s;e who engaged, and tho&s;e who did not, gave proofs that they were equally ardent in the &s;ervice of their country.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who think &s;uch matters de&s;erving of their notice, have ob|&s;erved, that this deci&s;ive naval en|gagement, the &s;urrender of the Pru&s;|&s;ian troops at Maxen, and the taking of Mun&s;ter, happened on the &s;ame day, the 20th of November.</P>
<P>This was the conclu&s;ion of the French affairs in Europe. The i&s;|&s;ue of the campaign in America had not been more favourable to them. Although the events in the Ea&s;t In|dies belong properly to the la&s;t year, yet, as the accounts did not arrive until this, and that the actions there were of great importance, and equal|ly fortunate on our &s;ide, it is proper that we &s;hould take &s;ome notice of them here.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h had by no means that &s;uperiority over the French in the Ea&s;t Indies, which they had in America. It was here the French &s;eemed to have made tho&s;e efforts, by which they hoped in &s;ome degree to ballance their lo&s;&s;es in other parts. They had a very &s;trong &s;quadron un|der Mon&s;. d'Ache in tho&s;e &s;eas. M. de Lally, an officer of credit, and of greater rank than had u&s;ually been &s;ent on that &s;ervice, commanded a body of 2000 Europeans, a great ar|my, in a country where the name of an European is it&s;elf a &s;trength. In the beginning, their &s;ucce&s;s &s;eemed proportioned to their forces; they took the fort and city of St. David's. But in a very &s;hort time the ill &s;tar of France, which in no part of the world &s;ets well on their affairs, be|gan to influence them here. M. d'Ache, in two naval engagements, was wor&s;ted, and prevented from co|operating with the land forces for the re&s;t of the campaign. And had the &s;pirit and conduct of Admiral Pococke been as well &s;econded by &s;ome of his captains, as it was by others, there is great rea&s;on to be|lieve, that the French naval power had been as effectually de&s;troy|ed
<PB N="130" REF="146">
in tho&s;e &s;eas, as it has been in tho&s;e of Europe.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e checks, it was nece&s;&s;ary that M. Lally &s;hould act. But it was not only the di&s;|grace of the French fleet, but an ex|treme want of money which delay|ed his operations. A Prince of the country, the King of Tanjour, ap|peared the only re&s;ource which was open. To this Prince he applied for a con&s;iderable &s;um of money, which being re&s;olutely refu&s;ed, he carried the war into his dominions, and laid &s;iege to his capital city. But after lying &s;everal days before it, and after having even made a practicable breach, the &s;kill of &s;ome Engli&s;h gunners, the want of provi|&s;ions and ammunition, and the di&s;|orders which reigned in his army, obliged him to return without the money, and with the mortification of being beaten from a place, only for|tified after the Indian manner.</P>
<P>This failure in their pecuniary expectations, and their repul&s;e from an Indian town, were bad encourage|ments to the undertaking of an en|terprize again&s;t an European ene|my, and a fortification in &s;ome de|gree regular. But having &s;eized upon a Dutch ve&s;&s;el, as it is thought much with its own con&s;ent, which contained a large trea&s;ure, they &s;et out at length to be&s;iege Madra&s;s. But here their &s;ucce&s;s was no better than at Tanjour, tho' their &s;trength was greater, and their efforts much more ob&s;tinate.</P>
<P>Colonel draper and Major Brere|ton defended the place with the utmo&s;t &s;kill and bravery. Mr. Pi|got likewi&s;e with equal genero&s;ity and prudence, &s;econded their endea|vours, by the &s;upplies of &s;tores and ammunition, which were admirably di&s;tributed, and co-operated with the military with a firmne&s;s and in|trepidity, by which he obtained an honour equal to any in the defence of the place. Whil&s;t the town was defended with great &s;pirit within; parties were continually &s;ent out, which &s;o infe&s;ted the roads through which the enemy's convoys were to pa&s;s, that their army in the trenches was infinitely weakened by the de|tachments which they were obliged to &s;end out. After a &s;iege of more than two months, they were obliged to abandon their enterprize, and by that means renounce for ever all tho&s;e &s;anguine hopes, which they had entertained from the forces in this part of the world. The Eng|li&s;h, on the contrary, went on from &s;ucce&s;s to &s;ucce&s;s. Whil&s;t they de|feated the French on the Ea&s;tern coa&s;t of the great penin&s;ula of India, on the we&s;tern they took the great and opulent city of Surat from the powers of the country, with very little lo&s;s.</P>
<P>General Lally left Madra&s;s in the utmo&s;t tran&s;ports of rage and de&s;pair, which a man of honour and ability in his profe&s;&s;ion can feel, who is ill &s;econded by his troops, neglected by tho&s;e who ought to &s;upport him, and cheated by the villainy of con|tracters, and of all tho&s;e who turn war into a low traffick. His letter is a &s;trong and very &s;triking picture of the&s;e agitations; and certainly it is worthy of remark, that every where there &s;hould appear &s;omething more unaccountably wrong and weak in the management of the French, than has been in the conduct of that or almo&s;t any other nation at any time. It &s;eems to argue an e&s;&s;ential and radical fault in &s;ome &s;uperior part of their government, more ea&s;ily in|deed vi&s;ible in its con&s;equences, than di&s;coverable in its cau&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="147">
In Europe they rececived offers of peace from the Kings of Great Britain and Pru&s;&s;ia. But as they did not expect, from their &s;ituation, very advantageous or honourable terms, they re&s;olved to act, in one in&s;tance, the Roman part, and &s;till hold out, determined to hazard the la&s;t extremities; perhaps, hoping &s;omething favourable from the for|tune of their allies, &s;ince their own had de&s;erted them; and re&s;olving to contract their plan, and to make one &s;trong effort in one part, rather than unprofitably to wa&s;te their &s;trength upon &s;everal inferior ob|jects. This effort could be made with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s only in Germany. But the &s;upplies ne|ce&s;&s;ary for this great charge, were difficult to a nation, who&s;e trade was wholly de&s;troyed. On this oc|ca&s;ion they did not &s;cruple to break in upon the public faith, and to find &s;upplies for one year in an expedient, that &s;truck at the &s;ources of all future credit. They &s;topped the payment on many public bills and funds <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The French court have &s;topt payment of the following public debts, viz. 1. The three kinds of rents created on the po&s;ts. 2. Tho&s;e con&s;tituted upon the che&s;t of redemptions. 3. The coupons of bills on the &s;ame che&s;t. 4. Tho&s;e of the two royal lotteries. 5.

The King threw in his own plate into the public &s;tock as an example, and a reque&s;t that others &s;hould contribute in the &s;ame manner from their private fortune, to the nece&s;&s;ities of the &s;tate; tho' &s;everal of the nobility, and many churches and convents &s;ent in their plate, there was yet a general back|wardne&s;s to give into this method of &s;upply, and to tru&s;t the public with &s;o con&s;iderable part of their &s;ub|&s;tance at the in&s;tant when they &s;aw it &s;o notoriou&s;ly break its faith in other particulars.</P>
<P>However, the&s;e re&s;ources, &s;uch as they are, will enable them to keep the war on foot. They turn their whole attention to Germany, where they have very greatly augmented their army, and placed it under a general, from whom they have &s;ome hopes, after their repeated di&s;appoint|ments, and the frequent changes they have made. They propo&s;e al|&s;o another army under the Prince de Soubi&s;e; if they can compa&s;s this latter project, as it is believed they may, the &s;y&s;tem of Germany is &s;till in very imminent danger. For not|with&s;tanding the tried goodne&s;s of our troops, and the admirable com|mander at the head of them, it is certain, even with any reinforce|ments we may be able to &s;end, we &s;hall find it very difficult to con|tend with two armies, &s;uppo&s;ing that we &s;hall have no other than French armies to contend with, and that the King of Pru&s;&s;ia &s;hould be able, as he has hitherto been, to find employ|ment for the many, the powerful, and the implacable enemies that &s;ur|round him.</P>
<P>It is certain he is much reduced; and that his re&s;ources are nearly ex|hau&s;ted.
<PB N="132" REF="148">
The&s;e are facts which cannot be concealed; and yet &s;ome glimmering of hopes may be &s;till pre&s;erved, when we con&s;ider the admirable talents for war and go|vernment, which that monarch po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es; and when we con&s;ider even the events of the la&s;t (to him) un|fortunate campaign; where after having &s;uffered four capital defeats, and having obtained no one con&s;ider|able advantage, he has yet continued in &s;ome &s;ort &s;uperior in the field; the enemy has not been able to make the lea&s;t impre&s;&s;ion upon his dominions; and he has, at la&s;t, more than divided Saxony with them; the city of Dre&s;den is all that they po&s;&s;e&s;s in that country, and the acqui&s;ition of which has been the only fruit of four campaigns, and four victories in one campaign, and the efforts of the united forces of Au&s;tria, Ru&s;&s;ia, and the Empire, to &s;ay nothing of France and Sweden.</P>
<P>As for Great Britain, &s;he has only to fear from her connections. In no one year &s;ince &s;he was a nation, has &s;he been favoured with &s;o many &s;ucce&s;&s;es, both by &s;ea and land, and in every quarter of the globe; nor have her officers, both by &s;ea and land, ever done more honour to their country, by their &s;kill and bravery. And with regard to the in|ternal admini&s;tration, it &s;uffices to &s;ay, that whil&s;t France became bank|rupt, without delay or murmuring there has been more than &s;ix millions borrowed in England at a very ea&s;y rate; and that the intere&s;t on this immen&s;e &s;um has been made good by a &s;ingle tax upon malt, which will &s;carce be felt by the people. By this the re&s;ources of England may be imagined; e&s;pecially if we con&s;ider, that highly as we are taxed for the nece&s;&s;ary charges of the war; we have not been prevented from great and expen&s;ive voluntary exertions of public &s;pirit and bene|ficence. The cities of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter, and after their ex|ample other towns, made a large &s;ub&s;cription for enli&s;ting &s;oldiers. Sub|&s;criptions were al&s;o carried on to a great amount, for cloathing the ene|mies pri&s;oners, abandoned through the neglect or poverty of their &s;ove|reign; and for admini&s;tering to the relief of the families of tho&s;e who had fallen in the battles of Quebec and Minden. Thus actuated by the warme&s;t patrioti&s;m, which far from extingui&s;hing, &s;eemed to kindle a beneficence towards our enemies in their di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>The condition of Europe, which all people thought would have been decided in this campaign, is nearly as dubious as ever; and the difficulties which oppo&s;e them|&s;elves to a peace are rather aug|mented than dimini&s;hed. Here then we clo&s;e the &s;cene, and conclude the events of the pre&s;ent year; in the next we hope, notwith&s;tanding appearances, after &s;o many &s;cenes of horror, to have the more plea&s;ing ta&s;k of relating the &s;teps taken to a general peace, on terms as par|ticularly advantageous to our own country, as the mixed intere&s;ts of Europe, and the various fortunes of the powers embarked in the &s;ame cau&s;e, will admit.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>Nothing decided in the war. State of the &s;everal powers concerned. Great Britain and Pru&s;&s;ia propo&s;e an accommodation. Difficulties in concluding a peace. The condition and hopes of France. Demands on the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. Treaty &s;aid to be between Ru&s;&s;ia and Au&s;tria.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IF all the wars which have ha|ra&s;&s;ed Europe for more than a century had not proved it, the events of the la&s;t campaigns mu&s;t have &s;atisfied every thinking man, that victories do not decide the fate of nations. Four mo&s;t bloody, and to all appearance mo&s;t ruinous de|feats, which he &s;uffered in that year, had de&s;poiled the king of Pru&s;&s;ia of no more than a &s;ingle town. After the&s;e accumulated blows he &s;till found him&s;elf in a condition to make good his winter|quarters; to cover his dominions; and to tempt the favour of fortune in another campaign.</P>
<P>To carry our attention a little further back; who could have ima|gined, that when the French had compelled the Hanoverian troops to lay down their arms, when they had thru&s;t them into a defencele&s;s corner, had bound them down with the yoke of a &s;trict and &s;evere capi|tulation, and had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves of every place which could boa&s;t the &s;malle&s;t &s;hare of &s;trength in the king's German dominions, that in a few months they &s;hould find
<PB N="134" REF="150">
them&s;elves compelled to fly before their captives; and after having &s;uf|fered a con&s;iderable defeat, &s;hould be pu&s;hed back almo&s;t on their own territories.</P>
<P>On the other hand, it might have been &s;uppo&s;ed that the effects of the&s;e advantages under the management of a very great commander, who was be&s;ides largely reinforced, could have been fru&s;trated only by the lo&s;s of &s;ome great battle. But the fact was otherwi&s;e. The Hano|verians, without any adver&s;e &s;troke in that campaign, were obliged to repa&s;s the Rhine and the Lippe; and &s;ince that time, fortune having decided nothing by the events of five years war, has given to Prince Ferdinand the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a great part of We&s;tphalia in the manner of a conquered country; and yet &s;ees him abandoning He&s;&s;e, and with dif|ficulty covering the borders of Ha|nover.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the victory of Crevelt could not enable the Duke of Brun&s;|wick to defend the Rhine. The battle of Bergen did not give M. Broglio an entrance into Hanover. The great victory of Minden did not drive the French from the Maine. We have &s;een armies, after complete victory, obliged to act as if they had been defeated; and after a defeat, taking an offen&s;ive part with &s;ucce&s;s, and reaping all the fruits of victory.</P>
<P>The&s;e reflections are &s;till more &s;trongly enforced by the fortune of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. Covered with the laurels of Lowo&s;itz, Prague, Ro&s;bach and Li&s;&s;a, when he began after &s;o many compleat triumphs, to pur&s;ue his advantages, and to improve &s;ucce&s;s into conque&s;t, the &s;cene was &s;uddenly altered. As &s;oon as he attempted to penetrate with effect into the enemies coun|try, without having &s;uffered any very &s;ignal blow, without any con|&s;iderable mi&s;take committed upon his &s;ide, Fortune, who hath as it were attached her&s;elf to the defen|&s;ive, immediately for&s;ook him. He was not able to take a &s;ingle place. And tho&s;e advantages which at other times and &s;ituations, would have laid the foundation of la&s;ting empire, have in his ca&s;e only pro|tracted a &s;evere de&s;tiny, which &s;ome think in the end inevitable; but which as many, as great, and as en|tire victories &s;ince obtained over his forces, have not been yet able to bring upon him.</P>
<P>The ballance of power, the pride of modern policy, and originally invented to pre&s;erve the general peace as well as freedom of Eu|rope, has openly pre&s;erved its liberty. It has been the original of innume|rable and fruitle&s;s wars. That Po|litical torture by which powers are to be enlarged or abridged, accord|ing to a &s;tandard, perhaps not $$$y accurately imagined, ever has been, and it is to be feared will always continue a cau&s;e of infinite conten|tion and blood&s;hed. The foreign amba&s;&s;adors con&s;tantly re&s;iding in all courts, the negotiations ince&s;|&s;antly carrying on, &s;pread both con|federacies and quarrels &s;o wide, that whenever ho&s;tilities commence, the theatre of war is always of a prodigi|ous extent. All parties in tho&s;e dif|fu&s;ive operations, have of nece&s;&s;ity their &s;trong and weak &s;ides. What they gain in one part is lo&s;t in ano|ther; and in conclu&s;ion, their af|fairs become &s;o ballanced, that all the powers concerned are certain to lo&s;e a great deal; the mo&s;t fortu|nate acquire little; and what they do acquire is never in any rea|&s;onable proportion to charge and lo&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="151">
Frequent experience of this might prove one of the &s;tronge&s;t grounds for a la&s;ting peace in Eu|rope. But that &s;pirit of intrigue, which is the political di&s;temper of the time, that anxious fore&s;ight which forms the character of all the pre&s;ent courts, prevent the &s;alutary effects which might re&s;ult from this experience. The&s;e mo|dern treaties of peace, the fruits not of moderation but nece&s;&s;ity; tho&s;e engagements contracted when all the parties are wearied and none &s;atisfied, where none can properly be called conquerors or conquered, where after having &s;ought in vain to compel, they are content to over|reach, teem in the very moment they are formed, and from the very act of forming them, with the &s;eeds of new di&s;&s;entions, more implacable animo&s;ities, and more cruel wars. For if to forward the work of peace, any member in the&s;e alliances &s;hould acquire a ce&s;&s;ion of any importance in its favour, this afterwards be|comes a ground for another alli|ance, and for new intrigues to deprive them of their acqui&s;ition. To &s;ettle the peace of Germany, Sile&s;ia was yielded in 1745 to the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, and that ce&s;&s;ion gave occa&s;ion for the war of 1756.</P>
<P>The kings of Great Britain and Pru&s;&s;ia cho&s;e the moment of &s;uc|ce&s;s, to propo&s;e an accommodation; and they de&s;ired that the oppo&s;ite powers &s;hould concur with them in nominating &s;ome place for a con|gre&s;s. Some &s;poke of Leip&s;ic, as a means of indemnification to that un|fortunate city; the States General would have given a town of theirs; King Stani&s;&s;aus offered Nancy, his capital: but the time of peace was not yet come. The two kings made a di&s;play of moderation; and they had rea&s;on to think that if their propo&s;als &s;hould be accepted (which probably they did not then expect) they mu&s;t naturally take the lead in that negotiation, and mu&s;t give the whole a turn to their ad|vantage. But the adver&s;e alliance unanimou&s;ly rejected their offers, and the refu&s;al of &s;ome of its mem|bers was couched in terms &s;ufficient|ly haughty.</P>
<P>To &s;peak impartially, they could not at that time have accepted pro|po&s;itions for peace. France had &s;uffered in every quarter: in her pre&s;ent condition &s;he could &s;carcely look for very favourable terms. As they had now abandoned in de&s;pair all attempts by &s;ea, and con&s;equent|ly all efforts in North America and both the Indies, all their hopes were centered in Germany. Hither|to their fortune in that country had not been very encouraging. But &s;till, in that country lay their be&s;t and indeed their only pro&s;pect. The &s;trength and per&s;everance of the two empre&s;&s;es, the wa&s;ted condition of the K of Pru&s;&s;ia, the enormous expence the German war to England, which mu&s;t gradually exhau&s;t the re&s;ources of her credit, and with them the patience of an incon&s;tant people, had in&s;pired with no &s;mall hope. All the&s;e con&s;iderations confirmed their re&s;olution of hearkening to no terms, until by acquiring &s;uperiori|ty, or at lea&s;t an equality, they might be a&s;&s;ured of procuring &s;uch as were not very di&s;advantageous or humiliating.</P>
<P>The empre&s;s queen upon her part had a moral certainty, that &s;he could not procure, by a treaty propo&s;ed at &s;uch a juncture, tho&s;e objects for which &s;he had begun, and with &s;uch &s;teadine&s;s in every fortune had car|ried on the war. In reality, her circum&s;tances then were and they &s;till continue very intricate and em|barra&s;&s;ed.
<PB N="136" REF="152">
It was nece&s;&s;ary that &s;he &s;hould have allies of great power; but if they have done her great &s;ervices, they have formed high preten&s;ions; indeed &s;o high, that if &s;he and her allies cannot ab&s;o|lutely pre&s;cribe the terms of peace, it is impo&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould all be in any degree &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>Her &s;ituation in this re&s;pect has pu&s;hed <HI>ad internecionem,</HI> the war between her and the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. Even the ce&s;&s;ion of all Sile&s;ia in her favour, cannot procure a peace for that monarch. The Ru&s;&s;ians will never let loo&s;e their hold of the ducal Pru&s;&s;ia; a country conquered by their own arms, a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion which rendered the king mo&s;t formidable to them, and which is their &s;ole in|demnification for what they have expended in a war entered into for other views than tho&s;e of glory, or even of revenge. It has been confidently a&s;&s;erted, that the em|pre&s;s queen of Hungary has actu|ally guarantied the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that country to its conquerors. This is indeed a very extraordinary &s;tep, and the fact is not &s;ufficiently authenti|cated. But the report is not alto|gether improbable. We may be &s;ure that if &s;uch a guarantee has been made, it has been entered in|to upon &s;ome reciprocal engagement of equal force, and for an object equally important.</P>
<P>Nothing but the la&s;t de&s;perate nece&s;&s;ity, nothing in &s;hort but being conquered in the mo&s;t ab&s;olute &s;en&s;e, will ever induce the King of Pru&s;&s;ia to &s;ubmit to both the&s;e ce&s;|&s;ions. By &s;uch a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, be&s;ide being de&s;poiled of that conque&s;t, which is the great glory of his reign, and con&s;titutes the firme&s;t &s;upport of his revenue, he will &s;ee his hereditary dominions curtailed of another province from whence he derives his royal title, and what makes it of infinitely greater im|portance in his eyes, the be&s;t com|mercial part of his territories, and that only part of his territories, by which he could have hoped to be|come in any degree a maritime power.</P>
<P>But tho' it were po&s;&s;ible that his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty could be brought to &s;ubmit to the&s;e humiliating terms, a great deal &s;till remains to be ad|ju&s;ted. There are other demands, which though not &s;o high in their nature, nor &s;o &s;trongly enforced, are notwith&s;tanding con&s;iderable, and cannot with any decency be totally neglected. What is the na|ture of the bargain between the Empre&s;s and the Senate of Sweden, has not yet been made publick. Be it what it will, this is probably the lea&s;t perplexing part of the whole.</P>
<P>But &s;ome indemnification for the King of Poland, on who&s;e domini|ons the greate&s;t calamities of the war have fallen, &s;eems ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; and on what principle can Au&s;tria ever expect an ally, if &s;he &s;hould &s;ecure all the benefits of the pacification to her&s;elf, and leave to her confederates nothing but the &s;ufferings of a war in which they were involved purely in her quarrel?</P>
<P>This variety of demands, all to be &s;atisfied out of the dominions of a &s;ingle prince, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily per|plex the work of peace with almo&s;t in&s;urmountable difficulties. It ought not indeed to be concealed, that there are circum&s;tances which feem to lead to &s;ome &s;olution of this em|barra&s;&s;ment. But if they are atten|tively con&s;idered, they will, I be|lieve, be rather found to increa&s;e it.</P>
<P>Great Britain has had remarkable &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t France at &s;ea, in America and in the Indies. On the continent of Europe, her for|tune
<PB N="137" REF="153">
is even at this day, tolerably ballanced: the two weak parts, therefore, in the oppo&s;ite alliances, (I &s;peak only with regard to the events of the pre&s;ent war) are France and Pru&s;&s;ia. As therefore France will expect &s;ome ce&s;&s;ions from Great Britain, it is rea&s;onable that they &s;hould be bought by &s;ome moderation of the rigorous terms which otherwi&s;e would have been impo&s;ed on Pru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>All the &s;acrifices to peace mu&s;t be made out of the advantage ac|quired by Au&s;tria and Great Britain. But when Great Britain &s;hall have con&s;ented to &s;ome conce&s;&s;ions, to forward this great work, what re|turn can the Empre&s;s Queen make, but an abatement of her demands upon Sile&s;ia? That is, by giving up that grand, favourite, and indeed to her &s;ole object, for which &s;he has brought upon her|&s;elf an heavy war, di&s;gu&s;ted her ancient and natural allies, and pur|cha&s;ed the aid of her natural ene|my, at the price of places which the be&s;t blood of Europe has been &s;o often &s;hed to pre&s;erve in her fa|mily. To all who con&s;ider the cha|racter of that court, it will appear very plainly that &s;he will hazard almo&s;t any thing, and even ri&s;que tho&s;e con&s;equences to which her imprudent alliance with France has expo&s;ed her, rather than accept a peace which mu&s;t deprive her or her hopes of Sile&s;ia.</P>
<P>When the&s;e things are weighed, it will not appear wonderful that there have been &s;o few &s;erious over|tures for peace; and that the longer the war continues, the greater diffi|culties &s;eem to oppo&s;e them&s;elves to any conclu&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>The only hope that remains of any happy conclu&s;ion, is that &s;ome of the great members of the al|liance, wearied and exhau&s;ted, will at length fly off, and thereby throw the re&s;t into &s;uch confu&s;ion, that a peace will be &s;uddenly huddled up; and all difficulties not removed, but forgotten, by not allowing time to weigh and &s;tudy what may be gained or lo&s;t. This mu&s;t produce a &s;y&s;tem of pacification, the nature of which it is impo&s;&s;ible to fore&s;ee; becau&s;e it cannot be &s;aid upon which &s;ide this defection will begin; but prin|cipally becau&s;e the war &s;till con|tinues, in the event of which, in &s;pite of all that can be conjectured from the &s;trength and pre&s;ent con|dition of the powers concerned, for|tune will have &s;o large a &s;hare. But we may predict without ra&s;h|ne&s;s, that the fir&s;t overtures will be between Great Britain and France: for they never think of peace in Germany.</P>

<P>THIS was the po&s;ture of Eu|rope at the clo&s;e of the cam|paign of 1759. And all thoughts of peace being entirely removed, the war was pro&s;ecuted in this part of the world with the utmo&s;t vigour as &s;oon as the &s;ea&s;on permitted them to recommence operations.</P>
<P>But in America, the &s;everity of winter was not able wholly to inter|rupt the progre&s;s of the war. Ca|nada had been &s;uppo&s;ed conquered,
<PB N="138" REF="154">
by the taking of Quebec. Indeed without the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that place, it had been impo&s;&s;ible to reduce that country; but &s;till a great deal re|mained to compleat the advantage to which the taking of Quebec had only given an opening. The French troops after their defeat, had retired into the heart of their country. And the Engli&s;h navy having provided the town &s;ufficiently with military &s;tores and provi&s;ions, &s;et &s;ail, fearing le&s;t they &s;hould be overtaken by the fro&s;t. Ten battalions, two companies of the artillery, one of American wood|rangers, in all about 7000 men, formed the garri&s;on which was left in Quebec to command Canada during the winter, and to facilitate the en|tire reduction of that province in the en&s;uing campaign. They were un|der the orders of Gen. Murray.</P>
<P>As the river St. Laurence is com|monly &s;hut up by ice, for the greater part of the winter, all communication with Europe was cut off. The con|quering army was therefore &s;ubject to be inve&s;ted in Quebec. The French commander M. Levi, was &s;en&s;ible of this advantage; and he &s;aw that it was the only re&s;ource by which he could have any chance of pre&s;erving Canada. He accordingly prepared to make u&s;e of this la&s;t, and only opportunity; and he was not with|out &s;ome pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>He knew that the fortifications of Quebec were weak and incomplete, without any kind of outwork; that the town was almo&s;t a general ruin, &s;ince the late &s;iege; and that the Engli&s;h garri&s;on had been much en|feebled, and greatly reduced in their numbers by the &s;curvy. He knew al&s;o, that by &s;ome misfortune, no provi&s;ion had been made to prevent his attaining a &s;uperiority on the ri|ver; as no ve&s;&s;els had been left, on a &s;uppo&s;ition, that they could not be u&s;eful in winter.</P>
<P>The winter had pa&s;&s;ed in &s;kir|mi&s;hes always terminating in fa|vour of the Engli&s;h, by which they enlarged the &s;phere of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. M. Levi had indeed propo&s;ed, during the rigour of the &s;ea&s;on, to attempt the place by a coup de main; and had made pre|parations for that purpo&s;e. But the activity of the garri&s;on was &s;uch; and all the outpo&s;ts &s;o well &s;ecured, that he thought it more prudent to abandon that de&s;ign, and to po&s;t|pone his operations, to the opening of the &s;pring, when a regular &s;iege might be formed.</P>
<P>The forces which &s;till remained in Canada, were not unequal to the attempt. Ten battalions of re|gular troops, amounting to near five thou&s;and men; 6000 of the experienced militia of Canada; a|bout 300 &s;avages. This was the force which M. Levi had collected at Montreal, and with which he took the field on the 17th of April, 1760.</P>
<P>His provi&s;ions, ammunition, and heavy baggage, fell down the river St. Laurence, under the convoy of &s;ix frigates from 44 to 26 guns. By this &s;quadron, which there was no|thing to oppo&s;e, he acquired the undi&s;puted command of the river, a point of the greate&s;t importance to the whole de&s;ign. In ten days march, the French army arrived at the heights of Abraham three miles from Quebec.</P>
<P>When Gen. Murray perceived the approach of the enemy, he had two parties to take, either to keep within the town, and confiding in his troops, which though weak as an army, were &s;trong as a garri&s;on, to &s;u&s;tain the &s;iege to the utmo&s;t extremity; or to march out, and by trying the fortune of the field, to avoid the tedious hard&s;hips of a
<PB N="139" REF="155">
&s;iege, in a place which &s;eemed to him &s;carcely tenable.</P>
<P>He re&s;olved on the latter party. But when he came to review his ability for this undertaking, he could po&s;&s;ibly draw into the field no more than three thou&s;and men. However he was not frighted by the enemies great &s;uperiority. He determined to engage; and he grounded his re&s;olution on the fol|lowing rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, that his army, notwith|&s;tanding its inferiority, was in the habit of beating the enemy. That they had a fine train of field artil|lery; that to &s;hut them&s;elves up at once within the walls, was putting all upon the &s;ingle chance of hold|ing out for a con&s;iderable time a wretched fortification; a chance which an action in the field could hardly alter, at the &s;ame time that it gave an additional one, and per|haps a better; and in fine, that if the event was not pro&s;perous, he might, after holding out to the la&s;t extremity, retreat, with what &s;hould remain of the garri&s;on, to the i&s;le of Orleans or Coudres, and there wait for reinforcements.</P>
<P>It is not ea&s;y to comprehend the prudence of engaging in the open field, an army four times &s;uperior; e&s;pecially when the weaker army had it in their power to keep upon the defen&s;ive in a &s;trong po&s;t; and Quebec may well be con&s;idered at lea&s;t as a &s;trong retrenchment. It is as hard to under&s;tand how the chance of holding out a fortre&s;s, &s;hould not be le&s;&s;ened after a defeat of the troops, which compo&s;e the garri&s;on, who mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;uffer by &s;uch an event, both in numbers and in &s;pirit; it is equally difficult to con|ceive how the remains of that gar|ri&s;on, which &s;hould be driven from Quebec, could have &s;afely retreated to the i&s;le of Orelans or Coudres, or have remained in either of the&s;e places, with any tolerable &s;ecurity, whil&s;t the enemy were, as they were, confe&s;&s;edly ma&s;ters of the river. The&s;e are matters not &s;o ea&s;ily com|prehended by tho&s;e who are at a di&s;|tance from the &s;cene of action; there circum&s;tances may have given the&s;e rea&s;ons their due weight; and they had the greater influence from the character of the general; a man of the mo&s;t ardent and intrepid courage, pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;irous of glory, and emulous of the reputa|tion Wolfe had acquired. He knew that a bold and &s;ucce&s;sful &s;troke, and well pur&s;ued, might &s;o di&s;|able the enemy who were in no likelihood of receiving &s;peedy or con&s;iderable &s;uccours from France, that the way to conque&s;t would lie plain and open before him; and he might expect the honour of the to|tal reduction of Canada, before the arrival of the re&s;t of the king's forces to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Thus depending on fortune, on the tried goodne&s;s of his troops, and his own courage to animate them, he marched out of the city, and de&s;cended from the heights of Abra|ham with the army mentioned above, and twenty field pieces. The right and left of the enemy's van po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of &s;ome &s;mall woody eminences: the main army marched by the road of St. Foix; and formed them&s;elves under the &s;helter of the woods. Whil&s;t the body of the enemies army was yet unformed, the Engli&s;h troops attacked their van, both on the right and left, with the utmo&s;t impetuo&s;ity, and drove them from the eminences, though they were well maintained; the advan|ced po&s;ts of the French center gave way, without a blow, and fell back upon their main army.</P>

Hitherto the fortune of the field was favourable to the Engli&s;h; but now the advantages they had ob|tained brought them full on the main army of the French, which formed in columns, and advanced with great rapidity to &s;upport their broken vanguard The fire became very hot, and &s;topped the progre&s;s of our troops; whil&s;t tho&s;e of the enemy having &s;upported their center, wheeled round the flanks of the Briti&s;h army to the left and right, and formed a &s;emi circle, which threatened to clo&s;e upon our rear. Proper movements were made to protect the flanks, but it was evi|dent the army was in the greate&s;t danger, not only of a defeat, but of &s;eeing it&s;elf &s;urrounded, and its retreat to Quebec intirely inter|cepted. Near one thou&s;and men, &s;oldiers and officers, (a third of the army), had been by this time killed and wounded. Nothing could be now thought of but as &s;peedy a re|treat as po&s;&s;ible; and in this there were difficulties, which nothing but the bravery of the &s;oldiery and the &s;kill and &s;pirit of the officers could overcome. They gained Quebec with little lo&s;s in the pur&s;uit; but they were obliged to leave their cannon, which they could not bring off, on account of the wreaths of &s;now, which even in this advanced &s;ea&s;on, and in the temperate lati|tude of 47, &s;till lay upon the ground. The French lo&s;t at lea&s;t 2000 in the action.</P>
<P>When the account of this victory arrived in Europe, the French were for a while infinitely elated. The blow was &s;en&s;ibly felt in England. Our &s;anguine hopes were at once &s;unk. If Quebec was lo&s;t, it was evident that the greate&s;t difficulties mu&s;t have ari&s;en to our affairs in America; and the reduction of Canada mu&s;t become the work of more than one campaign. Nobody imagined that the town could hold out long after &s;uch a defeat; and the fleet &s;ent from Europe to reinforce the place was then at a great di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s all things were pre|pared at Quebec for a vigorous de|fence. The late check he had re|ceived, only rou&s;ed the governor to more &s;trenuous efforts. He knew that the lo&s;s of the place would be attributed to the temerity of his councils; he was &s;en&s;ible that in proportion to the honours paid by the public to tho&s;e who had con|quered Quebec, would their indig|nation fall upon tho&s;e by whom it &s;hould happen to be lo&s;t; and that in general nothing makes a wor&s;e figure, than a ra&s;hne&s;s which is not fortunate. The&s;e thoughts were perpetual &s;tings to a mind like his, pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;irous of glory; and that very di&s;po&s;ition which led him to fight un&s;ucce&s;sfully with a weak army, gave him activity and &s;ucce&s;s in the defence of a weak fortifica|tion.</P>
<P>The French, who&s;e whole hope of &s;ucce&s;s depended on perfecting their work before a Briti&s;h &s;quadron could arrive, lo&s;t not a moment's time to improve their victory. They opened trenches before the town the very night of the battle. But it was the 11th of May before they could bring two batteries to play upon the fortifications. They were greatly deficient in this re&s;pect. Their accounts &s;ay, they had no more than twelve pieces of iron artillery, which carried twelve pound balls. The Engli&s;h train, was without compari&s;on, &s;uperior. Be|fore the French had opened their batteries, 132 pieces of cannon were placed on the ramparts. The fire of the be&s;iegers was therefore
<PB N="141" REF="157">
always &s;lack, interrupted, and of little effect.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the weakne&s;s of the enemies fire, the &s;uperiority of the Engli&s;h artillery, and the re&s;olu|tion of the governor and garri&s;on, the relief of the place depended en|tirely on the early arrival of the Briti&s;h fleet, which was looked out for every hour with the mo&s;t anxious expectation. Had any French &s;hips of force come before the Engli&s;h, it was the general opinion that the place mu&s;t inevitably have fallen into their hands.</P>
<P>On the 9th of May, to the great joy of the garri&s;on, an Engli&s;h fri|gate anchored in the ba&s;on and brought them an account that the Briti&s;h &s;quadron commanded by Lord Colville, was then in the river. On the 15th, a &s;hip of the line and a frigate arrived; the next morning the two frigates were &s;ent to attack the French &s;quadron above the town. They executed their commi&s;&s;ion &s;o well, that in a moment all the French ve&s;&s;els of whatever kind were di&s;|per&s;ed, and the greate&s;t part de&s;troy|ed or taken.</P>
<P>M. Levi, who had the mortifi|cation to behold from the eminences this action, which at one &s;troke put an end to all the hopes he had conceived from his late victory, was per&s;uaded that the&s;e frigates by the boldne&s;s of their manner, mu&s;t have been the vanguard of a con&s;iderable reinforcement; and that too clo&s;e at hand: he therefore rai&s;ed the &s;iege in the utmo&s;t hurry and precipitation, leaving behind all his artillery, and a great part of his ammunition and baggage, although Lord Colville, with the re&s;t of the &s;quadron, did not arrive at Quebec until two days after.</P>
<P>Thus was fortunately pre&s;erved from the mo&s;t imminent danger, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable place we had taken in the war; and that which gave us the mo&s;t deci&s;ive advantage. The triumph of the French, and the anxiety of England, were but &s;hort. The account of the &s;iege, and the rai&s;ing of it, followed clo&s;e on the heels of each other. And there was nothing now to cloud the pro&s;pect of the certain reduction of Canada, by the united efforts of three Engli&s;h armies, who by different routs were moving to attack tho&s;e parts of it which &s;till remained to France. In the mean time that haughty power was obliged to &s;it the impotent &s;pec|tator of the ruin of her colonies, with|out being able to &s;end them the &s;mal|le&s;t &s;uccour. It was then &s;he found what it was to be inferior at &s;ea.</P>

<P>A Winter remarkably &s;evere &s;uc|ceeded the bloody campaign of 1758. At Bareith in the night of the 16th of December, the cold was in&s;upportable. Reaumur's ther|mometer was &s;unk to 15, which is
<PB N="142" REF="158">
preci&s;ely the &s;ame degree it fell to in 1709. A year like this di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the inten&s;ene&s;s of the cold, and the fury of war. Birds dropped dead in their flight. At Leip&s;ic ten centinels were frozen to death. An infectious di&s;ea&s;e which began in the armies, diffu&s;ed it&s;elf among the inhabitants of Saxony, and made a dreadful havock. A pe&s;tilential contagion raged among the cattle. Famine was &s;oon added to the re&s;t of their calamities; and every mi&s;ery that can afflict man|kind, was poured out upon that unfortunate people with the mo&s;t liberal mea&s;ure. There was no pro&s;|pect of an alleviation of the&s;e di&s;|tre&s;&s;es. On the contrary, the &s;uf|ferings of the people only made their &s;overeigns more earne&s;t for revenge; and out of the general want a re|&s;ource aro&s;e to their armies, who were the more readily recruited, becau&s;e the &s;canty pay and &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence of a &s;oldier, became an ob|ject of envy to the wretched pea&s;an|try in mo&s;t of the&s;e countries; and death &s;eemed more honourable and le&s;s certain by the &s;word, than by penury and di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>France and England vied in their endeavours to augment their forces in Germany. M. Broglio had now the command of the grand army, and the &s;ole conduct of the general plan of operations. He had early in this year, been honoured with the &s;taff of a mar&s;hal of France. And nothing was omitted to give lu&s;tre to his command, and to furni&s;h him with every means of exerting his talents. His corps was augment|ed to near 100,000 effective men. Thirty thou&s;and drawn out of their quarters in Du&s;&s;eldorp, Cleves, Co|logn and We&s;el, and compleated by draughts from France, formed a &s;eparate army on the Rhine, under the Count de St. Germain. This di&s;po&s;ition was made not only to divide the attention of the allied ar|my; but to prevent the ill con&s;e|quences of the mi&s;under&s;tanding which was known to &s;ub&s;i&s;t between this general and the Duke de Broglio. The third army propo&s;ed at the clo&s;e of the foregoing campaign did not appear.</P>
<P>On the &s;ide of England, the pre|parations were not le&s;s con&s;iderable in proportion to her ability for that kind of war. Six regiments of foot commanded by Major Ge|neral Gri&s;&s;in, were forthwith &s;ent to reinforce the allied army. El|liot's regiment of light hor&s;e &s;oon followed them. At the opening of this campaign, we had in Ger|many twelve regiments of heavy, and one of light hor&s;e; and twelve regiments, with two Highland bat|talions of foot; the whole amount|ing to about 22000 men. In the cour&s;e of the &s;ummer, they were further reinforced to near 25000. Such a number of Briti&s;h troops, &s;erving in one army, had not been &s;een on the continent, for two hundred years pa&s;t. The al|lied army indeed fell &s;hort of the French in numbers; but they ex|ceeded it in the quality of the troops. Tho&s;e newly arrived from England were fre&s;h but not undi&s;|ciplined; the old were indeed har|ra&s;&s;ed, but they had been accu&s;tom|ed to victory.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the year, the death of the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el had ex|cited <NOTE PLACE="marg">31 J$n.</NOTE> &s;ome apprehen&s;ions; the di&s;|po&s;itions of the &s;ucce&s;&s;or were un|certain; and his withdrawing him|&s;elf from the cau&s;e of the allies would have made a breach in their
<PB N="143" REF="159">
army, that it would have proved al|mo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to &s;top. But the&s;e fears were &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated. The new Landgrave among the very fir&s;t acts of his government, gave the &s;trong|e&s;t proofs of his &s;teady adherence to the &s;y&s;tem of his father, and even agreed to add con&s;iderably to the He&s;&s;ian troops in the pay of Great Britain; &s;o that all things promi&s;ed as favourably to the allies, as from that irremediable inferiority in num|ber could have been expected.</P>
<P>The king of Pru&s;&s;ia was under far greater difficulties; he had felt the heavie&s;t blows, and was mo&s;t &s;canted in the means of healing them.</P>
<P>His lo&s;&s;es were not to be reckoned by the men killed and pri&s;oners, but by armies de&s;troyed or taken. Forty generals had died, or were &s;lain in his &s;ervice, &s;ince the fir&s;t of October 1756 exclu&s;ive of tho&s;e who had been wounded, di&s;abled or made pri&s;oners. And this alone would have been a lo&s;s not to be repaired, if the&s;e murdering wars which cut off &s;o many experienced officers, did not at the &s;ame time, form &s;o many more to &s;upply their places. The king had renewed his alliance on the former terms with Great Britain. By his indefatigable indu&s;try, no gaps were &s;een in his armies. But they were no longer the &s;ame troops, and if the King of Pru&s;&s;ia had formerly the merit of ably commanding the mo&s;t excellent armies; he was now to fill up the mo&s;t remarkable deficiency on the part of his troops by his own he|roi&s;m; and to undertake far more arduous enterprizes, than his fir&s;t, with in&s;initely weaker in&s;truments. His affairs wore a bad a&s;pect in the opening of the former year. In this they &s;eemed altogether de&s;perate.</P>
<P>The Ru&s;&s;ians had &s;uffered; but they were &s;ufficiently reinforced. The Swedes who had been generally obliged to give ground in the winter, had in that of 1759 the advantage in &s;everal &s;mart &s;kirmi&s;hes, and had even taken pri&s;oner the Pru&s;&s;ian general Manteuffel. As to the Au|&s;trians, victorious for a whole cam|paign almo&s;t without fighting, their armies and magazines were full, their corps compleat, their men fre&s;h, vigorous, and full of re&s;olu|tion. Several &s;kirmi&s;hes of con&s;e|quence had been fought during the ce&s;&s;ation of the great operations; and they were generally to their ad|vantage.</P>
<P>The King of Pru&s;&s;ia was &s;en&s;ible, that in this, as in the former cam|paigns, he &s;hould be attacked by four armies; and that his dominions would be inve&s;ted upon every &s;ide. As the&s;e operations were very ex|ten&s;ive and complicated, to enable the reader to form an idea of the campaign, it will not be ami&s;s to &s;ay &s;omething of the ground the king had to defend, which is circum|&s;tanced in this manner.</P>
<P>To the north is Pomerania. This country is very open; and it is de|fended on that part on which the Swedes generally act, with but few and tho&s;e mean fortifications, An|clam, Demmein and Pa&s;&s;ewalk. But then the Swedi&s;h army is not nume|rous, and if they &s;hould attempt to penetrate far into the country, they mu&s;t leave Stetin, in which there is always a &s;trong garri&s;on behind them to their left, which would render their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence difficult and their retreat in ca&s;e of any mi&s;|fortune, extremely hazardous; and they have not &s;ufficient &s;trength to ma&s;ter this place by a regular &s;iege. This has always proved a check to
<PB N="144" REF="160">
the progre&s;s of that army, even when they have been otherwi&s;e &s;uc|ce&s;sful.</P>
<P>This &s;ame country to the ea&s;tward of the Oder, is one great object of the Ru&s;&s;ian de&s;igns. Its chief &s;trength in this quarter is the town of Colberg; a place they have frequently attempted, but always without &s;ucce&s;s. And their failure, in this in&s;tance, has been the main cau&s;e why they have never been able to take winter quarters in the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's dominions, or even during the campaign, to make any con&s;iderable impre&s;&s;ion upon Pomerania. For they can have no communication with their own country by &s;ea, for want of this port. On their rear, lies the exten|&s;ive and inho&s;pitable de&s;ert of Wal|dow; and this with the uncertain di&s;po&s;ition of the city of Dantzick, renders their &s;upplies of provi&s;ion from Poland difficult and precarious. Neither is it po&s;&s;ible in the&s;e circum|&s;tances, to unite their forces with tho&s;e of Sweden acting in the &s;ame country. The Oder flows be|tween them; which is &s;o command|ed by the city of Stetin, as to make all communication between the&s;e armies in a great mea&s;ure impracti|cable. In&s;omuch that on the &s;ide of Pomerania, the force of the&s;e two powers is compelled to act &s;eparate|ly, without concert, and therefore weakly and ineffectually.</P>
<P>To the we&s;tward the King of Pru&s;&s;ia is &s;ufficiently covered by the city of Magdebourg, the &s;tronge&s;t place in his dominions, and in that part of Germany. Here are his greate&s;t magazines, and his princi|pal founderies; and this is the re|po&s;itory of whatever he finds nece&s;|&s;ary to place out of the reach of &s;ud|den in&s;ult.</P>
<P>To the &s;outhward he is obliged to defend Saxony and Sile&s;ia. Both of the&s;e countries on their frontiers towards Bohemia, ri&s;e into very rough, broken, and mountainous grounds, abounding in advanta|geous po&s;ts and &s;trong &s;ituations. Lu&s;atia lies between them; a level &s;andy plain, (inter&s;per&s;ed with pine|woods,) extending without any ob|&s;tacle to the very gates of Berlin. Through this country the king's communication between Sile&s;ia and Saxony mu&s;t be kept up, and there|fore it has been from the beginning of this war, the great &s;cene of tho&s;e remarkable marches and counter|marches, by which his Pru&s;&s;ian ma|je&s;ty has acquired &s;o great a repu|tation; and al&s;o of tho&s;e bold and &s;udden attempts which have di&s;tin|gui&s;hed &s;ome of the generals of the adver&s;e party. As an army cannot be advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted in this ter|ritory, it has not been u&s;ual for a con|&s;iderable body to remain there long; and it is particularly unfavourable to defen&s;ive operations. This coun|try may be con&s;idered as the cur|tain, and the frontiers of Saxony and Sile&s;ia as the ba&s;tions, that flank the &s;ort of fortification, which the king is to maintain.</P>
<P>No part of that monarch's terri|tories are naturally more defencele&s;s than the ea&s;tern; at the &s;ame time that it is attacked by the mo&s;t pow|erful of his enemies. A country al|together &s;andy and level, extends along both &s;ides of the Oder, from the northern frontier of Sile&s;ia, until it meets Pomerania a country of the &s;ame kind. There is no re&s;pect|able fortification on this &s;ide; and the river Warta that falls here into the Oder, makes the tran&s;port of provi&s;ions, and con&s;equently the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the armies that act again&s;t him more ea&s;y.</P>
<P>As to Sile&s;ia, it is covered on the
<PB N="145" REF="161">
Bohemian &s;ide with mountains, and it contains places of &s;uch &s;trength as to be above the nece&s;&s;ity of yield|ing to the fir&s;t army that appears before them. Indeed it is to be re|marked that &s;uch a degree of &s;trength &s;eems &s;ufficient for the kind of &s;er|vice which has di&s;tingui&s;hed this war. Never was a war of &s;uch a length and extent, in which fewer &s;ieges of con&s;equence have been formed; and the late &s;ervice which affords &s;o large a field for experience in every other &s;pecies of military operations, affords very little matter of improvement in the art of reducing or defending &s;trong places.</P>
<P>The King of Pru&s;&s;ia's de&s;ign &s;eems to have been to &s;ave him&s;elf as much as po&s;&s;ible to the end of the campaign; the only time when his &s;ucce&s;s might be deci&s;ive, and his ill-fortune not ruinous. He therefore formed a defen&s;ive plan. In pur|&s;uance of this he withdrew his out|po&s;ts from Freyberg, and drawing a chain of cantonments from the fo|re&s;t of Tharandt on his right to the Elbe, he took a mo&s;t advantageous camp between that river and the Multa; &s;trongly entrenching it where it had not been previou&s;ly fortified by nature; and furni&s;hed it with &s;o numerous an artillery, that they rec|koned in their front only 250 pieces of cannon.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation he covered the mo&s;t material parts of Saxony, kept the attention of M. Daun's army en|gaged, and was enabled to &s;end out reinforcements to Prince Henry, or el&s;ewhere, as occa&s;ion &s;hould require, without expo&s;ing one part whil&s;t he defended another.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the king's army defended his conque&s;ts in Mi&s;nia, Prince Henry had a&s;&s;embled an army about Frank|fort on the Oder, and took various po&s;itions about that place and Cro&s;|&s;en. In this po&s;ition, he command|ed three principal communications, in &s;uch a manner as to protect at once Sile&s;ia, the New Marche of Brandenburgh, and the avenues to Berlin; all which were threatened by &s;everal bodies of the enemy. General Fouquet had e&s;tabli&s;hed his quarters near the county of Glatz, and whil&s;t he covered that &s;ide of Sile&s;ia communicated with Prince Henry, and was &s;o di&s;po&s;ed as to &s;end to or receive &s;uccours from him, as either party &s;hould happen to be pre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>M. Daun, as &s;oon as he &s;aw that the King of Pru&s;&s;ia had fortified him&s;elf in his po&s;t, he too buried him&s;elf in entrenchments, and kept the mo&s;t attentive eye upon all his maje&s;ty's motions. Whil&s;t he con|fined him&s;elf in this po&s;ition, in or|der to tie down the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, general Laudohn, with a &s;trong but light and di&s;incumbered army, moved from the camp he had occupied du|ring the winter in Bohemia, and pre|&s;enting him&s;elf alternately on the &s;ide of Lu&s;atia, and on the frontiers of Sile&s;ia, threatened &s;ometimes to pe|netrate to Berlin, &s;ometimes by a bold &s;troke to effect a junction with the Ru&s;&s;ians, and attack Prince Henry, &s;ometimes to &s;it down before Glatz, Schweidnitz, or Bre&s;lau; and thus the alarm was &s;pread upon every &s;ide, not knowing where the &s;torm would fall.</P>
<P>At length he declared him&s;elf. Having by &s;everal feints per&s;uaded General Fouquet that his inten|tions were again&s;t Schweidnitz, that general marched thither a con|&s;iderable body of his troops, and left Glatz uncovered. As &s;oon as Laudohn perceived this movement, he on his &s;ide made another, and
<PB N="146" REF="162">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of Land&s;hut; and when he had taken Land&s;hut, he pretended a de&s;ign of &s;ecuring this po&s;t by leaving a &s;mall body of troops there. This feint al&s;o &s;uc|ceeded, and drew General Fouquet from Schweidnitz back again to Land&s;hut. He drove the Au&s;trians from that place without difficulty; but in the mean time Laudohn made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of &s;everal important pa&s;&s;es, by which he was in &s;ome &s;ort enabled to &s;urround the corps of Ge|neral Fouquet.</P>
<P>That commander finding him&s;elf in tho&s;e dangerous circum&s;tances, had nothing left but to fortify his po&s;t, formerly made a very &s;trong one, with additional works; which he did with &s;uch effect, that it had more the re&s;emblance of a regular Fortification than an entrenchment. However, the army he commanded was far from numerous; and he was obliged to weaken it &s;till farther by a detachment of 2000 men, to pre|&s;erve, if po&s;&s;ible, a communication with Schweidnitz.</P>
<P>Laudohn longed to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf by &s;ome capital &s;troke; and he had now by a &s;eries of very artful movements procured a mo&s;t favourable opportunity. Fir&s;t, therefore, he &s;hut up with great dexterity the pa&s;&s;es on every &s;ide, and rendered his adver&s;ary's retreat impracticable. Then he began an <NOTE PLACE="marg">June 23.</NOTE> attack on the Pru&s;&s;ian en|trenchments in the dead of the night in three different places. The &s;ignal for the a&s;&s;ault was given by four hawbitzers fired in the air. The Au&s;trians ru&s;hed to the attack with uncommon fury, and maintained it with &s;o &s;teady a re&s;olution, that in three quarters of an hour the two &s;tronge&s;t entrench|ments were carried, and the line of communication forced. The Pru&s;&s;ians at day-break found them|&s;elves pu&s;hed back from hill to hill, and line to line, to their la&s;t en|trenchments. Their re&s;i&s;tance was all along brave, and their retreat re|gular. The enemy purcha&s;ed every advantage at the deare&s;t rate; but at la&s;t pre&s;&s;ed upon every &s;ide, worn down by a terrible &s;laughter, their general di&s;abled by two mortal wounds, at eight in the morning the remnant of the army threw down their arms, and &s;urrendered on the field of battle.</P>
<P>On the &s;ide of the vanqui&s;hed, the &s;lain were about 4000. The pri&s;oners were, one general of foot, namely General Fouquet; two ma|jor generals; four colonels; two hundred and thirteen officers of the inferior ranks; and upwards of 7000 private &s;oldiers, fifty-eight pieces of artillery, with a number of colours. Never was a more entire and deci|&s;ive victory. The whole army, ge|neral, officers, every thing was de|&s;troyed. Scarce three hundred of the body intrenched by Land&s;hut e&s;caped. The corps alone which was to pre&s;erve the communication, together with &s;ome bodies of cavalry who had not been engaged, with difficulty got into Schweidnitz, where they expected every moment to be be&s;ieged. This advantage co&s;t the Au&s;trians above 12000 men killed and wounded.</P>

<P>THIS victory was pur&s;ued with as much rapidity as it was obtained with courage and addre&s;s. Baron Loudohn immediately turned back from Land&s;hut, and fell like a &s;torm upon Glatz. Glatz con&s;i&s;ts of two fortre&s;&s;es, the old and the new. The old was taken by &s;torm; the new &s;urrendered at di&s;cretion. Two thou&s;and brave men and &s;ome good works could not defend it again&s;t the impetuo&s;ity of the Au&s;|trians. One hundred and one pieces of bra&s;s cannon were taken. Im|men&s;e magazines of provi&s;ion and military &s;tores piled up in this fron|tier place to favour in better times an irruption into Bohemia, fell into the hands of the conqueror. Every thing gave way. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Glatz laid all Sile&s;ia open, and the Au&s;trians might turn their arms upon any &s;ide without the lea&s;t danger to the freedom of their re|treat. Neither was there any &s;ort of army to give the lea&s;t ob&s;truction. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia held down by M. Daun, was in Saxony. Prince Henry was al&s;o at a great di&s;tance towards Cu&s;trin. If that Prince at|tempted to move to the relief of Si|le&s;ia, he laid open Brandenburgh, and even Berlin it&s;elf to the irrup|tions of the Ru&s;&s;ians. If he re|mained in his po&s;t, Sile&s;ia was in|evitably lo&s;t. Even his &s;peedie&s;t march &s;eemed by no means a cer|tain way to relieve it. The king was yet further di&s;tant; and any motion of his threatened to &s;hake and unhinge the whole &s;cheme of his defence; expo&s;ing at once Saxony and Berlin. The lo&s;s of his third army, &s;mall as that army was, laid him under difficulties that &s;eemed in&s;uperable.</P>
<P>Favoured by the&s;e circum&s;tances, Laudohn had only to chu&s;e what direction he &s;hould give his arms. Sile&s;ia, as has been ob&s;erved, lay open before him. He had threatened Schweidnitz; but he &s;aw that Bre&s;|lau was a place of greater con&s;e|quence, much more ea&s;ily reduced, and that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it facilitat|ed a junction with the Ru&s;&s;ians; a point on which the ultimate im|provement of his victory wholly de|pended. The place be&s;ides is of &s;o great extent, and the works of &s;o little comparative &s;trength, that he had no &s;mall hopes of ma&s;tering it before Prince Henry could come, if he &s;hould at all attempt to come to its relief.</P>
<P>He therefore delayed no longer than the march of his heavy artille|ry and the nece&s;&s;ary preparatives required, to lay &s;iege to the capi|tal of Sile&s;ia, of who&s;e &s;afety the mo&s;t &s;anguine friends of his Pru&s;|&s;ian maje&s;ty began to de&s;pair.</P>
<P>But in the interval between the battle of Land&s;hut and the com|mencement of the &s;iege of Bre&s;|lau, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia was not
<PB N="148" REF="164">
idle. His thoughts were continu|ally employed to repair this di&s;a&s;|ter; all ordinary re&s;ources were impracticable or ineffectual. His genius alone could enter the li&s;ts with his ill fortune. Placing there|fore his hopes in him&s;elf, he aimed by a daring and unexpected &s;troke, to draw even from &s;o &s;evere a mis|fortune &s;ome new and more bril|liant advantages.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of the plan he had laid, he di&s;po&s;ed all <NOTE PLACE="marg">2d July.</NOTE> things for a march towards Sile|&s;ia, and had pa&s;&s;ed the Elbe and penetrated through a woody coun|try without oppo&s;ition; had the enemy been appri&s;ed of his march as early as he began it, it had been attended with great and un|&s;urmountable difficulties. Mar&s;hal Daun no &s;ooner had advice of his march, than he al&s;o immediately moved with the utmo&s;t expedition at the head of his main army to|wards Sile&s;ia, leaving the army of the Empire, and a body under Ge|neral Lacy, to awe Saxony in his ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>The two armies continued their out through Lu&s;atia; that of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia a little to the northward, that of Mar&s;hal Daun to the &s;outhward; both apparently pu&s;hing towards the &s;ame object, and with equal eagerne&s;s. But as the army of the mar&s;hal had rather the &s;horter cut to make, and as he moved with far greater and more unaffected diligence, he got very con&s;iderably the &s;tart of the king. When his maje&s;ty was ap|pri&s;ed that Mar&s;hal Daun had <NOTE PLACE="marg">8th July.</NOTE> gained full two days march upon him; that he had actually arrived at Gotlitz, and was pu&s;hing by forced marches to Lauban; his great pur|po&s;e was obtained. Immediately he &s;truck into Mar&s;hal Daun's track, but wheeled into the oppo&s;ite direction, repa&s;&s;ed the Spree near Bautzen, and whil&s;t every one imagined him on the frontiers of Sile&s;ia, he &s;uddenly &s;prung up like a mine before Dre&s;|den. The army of the Empire re|tired. Lacy's corps was obliged to &s;hift its &s;ituation. The Pru&s;&s;ian generals Hul&s;en and Ziethen, who had probably been prepared to act in concert with the king, joined him before that place, and knowing there was <NOTE PLACE="marg">13th July.</NOTE> no room for delay, began the &s;iege with the utmo&s;t vigour.</P>
<P>Then was this mo&s;t unfortunate city a third time expo&s;ed to the fury of war. The inhabitants &s;uf|fered in their habitations for the weakne&s;s of the works; and there were armies both without and with|in of &s;uch mutual and determined rage, and &s;o carele&s;s of all things but their enmity, that they little &s;crupled to &s;trike at each other through the bodies of the &s;uffering Saxons. All Europe had now its eyes turned to the event of this ma&s;terly manoeuvre; and certainly through the whole cour&s;e of this eventful war, nothing appeared more worthy of regard, nor at any time had there been exhibited a piece of general&s;hip more compleat, than the conduct of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's march.</P>
<P>Since Dre&s;den had fallen into the hands of the Au&s;trians, it had been &s;trengthened with the addi|tion of &s;everal new works. The burning of the &s;uburb by the Pru&s;|&s;ians, in order to keep them out, became an advantage to them when they came to po&s;&s;e&s;s the town. In &s;hort, the place was ren|dered in all re&s;pects more defen&s;i|ble than formerly. It had al&s;o a
<PB N="149" REF="165">
very large garri&s;on under General Macguire, an officer of courage and experience, who re&s;olved to main|tain it to the la&s;t extremity: when he was &s;ummoned to &s;urrender, he made an&s;wer, "That it was im|po&s;&s;ible the king could have been appri&s;ed with his being entru&s;ted with the command of that capital; otherwi&s;e &s;o great a captain as his maje&s;ty would not make &s;uch a propo&s;al to an officer of his &s;tand|ing: that he would defend him&s;elf to the la&s;t man; and wait whatever the king &s;hould think proper to at|tempt."</P>
<P>Both parties being therefore in|&s;pired with the utmo&s;t re&s;olution, the one to attack, the other to de|fend, the &s;iege was pu&s;hed on by every method of force and addre&s;s; there was &s;carce any intermi&s;&s;ion of a&s;&s;aults, &s;urprizes, coup de mains, &s;allies, and all kinds of actions u&s;ed on &s;uch occa&s;ions; and all the mo&s;t vigorous in their way. In the mean time three batteries of cannon and mortars played continually, but with much greater damage to the buildings than effect on the forti|fications.</P>
<P>Mar&s;hal Daun was in Sile&s;ia when he heard all at once of the deceit put upon him by the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, of his return to Saxony, of the &s;iege, and the extreme dan|ger of Dre&s;den. His return was as rapid as his march had been. On the 19th he appeared within a league of Dre&s;den. His approach only cau&s;ed the Pru&s;&s;ians to re|double their efforts; that day they had received reinforcements of hea|vy cannon and mortars, and bat|tered the place with new fury. The cathedral church, the new &s;quare, &s;everal principal &s;treets, &s;ome pa|laces, the noble manufactory of porcelain, were all entirely reduced to a&s;hes.</P>
<P>The &s;iege continued till the 22d. The night of the 21 &s;t M. Daun had thrown &s;ixteen battalions into Dre&s;|den. It was in vain to continue any longer the pretence of be&s;ieging a whole army within the town, whil&s;t at the &s;ame time there was another army to reinforce it without. The king withdrew his forces without mole&s;tation from the &s;uburbs, tho' there were three con&s;iderable armies of the enemy in the neighbourhood, be&s;ides that which was within the walls.</P>
<P>Thus ended, without the &s;uc|ce&s;s &s;o ma&s;terly a proceeding de|&s;erved, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's fa|mous &s;tratagem. But the want of &s;ucce&s;s can detract nothing from the merit of the mea&s;ure. By drawing Mar&s;hal Daun from Saxony to Sile&s;ia, he gained the u&s;e of eight days, free of ob&s;truction from the enemy's grand army; eight days at a time when hours and even moments were critical. In this time he had certainly a chance at lea&s;t of reduc|ing Dre&s;den; and by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that place he would have found him&s;elf infinitely better able to car|ry his arms to the defence of every part of his territories for the pre&s;ent, and for the future would have that great place of retreat in ca&s;e of any misfortune. If he failed in this at|tempt his affairs were preci&s;ely in their former condition; and he could not &s;uffer in reputation by having made it.</P>
<P>As the King of Pru&s;&s;ia could not be blamed for the &s;peedy return of Mar&s;hal Daun, and the con&s;e|quences of that return; &s;o neither in effect could the mar&s;hal &s;uffer any ju&s;t imputation in having been deceived by the king's march. He
<PB N="150" REF="166">
knew that there were very plau|&s;ible motives to call, and even to pre&s;s him to move that way. He knew that if the king &s;hould get into Sile&s;ia without any oppo&s;ition from him, Laudohn might not only be deprived of all the advantages he could hope for from his late victory, but by being attacked by the united armies of the king and his brother, would run the ri&s;que of a defeat that might fully revenge that of Land&s;hut.</P>
<P>Whatever the merit of either of the commanders might be on this occa&s;ion, it is certain that Laudohn met no con&s;iderable ob&s;truction.</P>
<P>He appeared before Bre&s;law the 30th of July; the following day the town was compleatly inve&s;ted; and on the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t they had erected their batteries of cannon and mortars.</P>
<P>But Laudohn, who &s;aw all things prepared for an ob&s;tinate defence, did not wholly tru&s;t to his military manoeuvres. He &s;ent a letter to the governor Count Tavenzien, to in|timidate him by the di&s;play of his &s;trength. He &s;et forth, that his forces con&s;i&s;ted of 50 battalions and 80 &s;quadrons; that the Ru&s;|&s;ian army of 75,000 men were within three days march; that it was in vain for the governor to ex|pect &s;uccour from the King of Pru&s;|&s;ia, who was then at the other &s;ide of the Elbe; that it was &s;till more vain to look for relief from Prince Henry, who could &s;carce hope to &s;tand his own ground again&s;t the grand army of the Ru&s;&s;ians; that in ca&s;e of ob&s;tinacy he could expect no rea&s;onable terms; and that the&s;e were the la&s;t that &s;hould be offered. Moreover he reminded him, that the place was a mercantile town, not a fortre&s;s; and that he could not defend it without contravening the laws of war.</P>
<P>The&s;e rules, by which honour is reduced to act, not by its own feelings, but according to intrin&s;ical circum|&s;tances; rules by which they have attempted to determine exactly and mechanically that nice&s;t of all lines which di&s;criminates courage from ra&s;hne&s;s, form one of the &s;tronge&s;t in|&s;tances of the great difference between the ancient and modern methods and ideas of war. In the ancient times, a brave commander would have an|&s;wered this threatning me&s;&s;age in ge|neral terms of defiance. But Count Tavenzien re&s;pected the&s;e imaginary laws. He took care to prove that in defending the town, he did not in|fringe them; and &s;poke as Laudohn had done in the character of a mili|tary juri&s;con&s;ult, as well as a &s;oldier; he gave for reply, "That the town of Bre&s;law being &s;urrounded with works and wet ditches, was to be con&s;idered as a place of &s;trength, and not &s;imply as a mercantile town. That the Au&s;trians them&s;elves de|fended it as &s;uch in 1757, after the battle of Li&s;&s;a. That the king had commanded him to defend it to the la&s;t extremity, that therefore Gene|ral Laudohn might &s;ee it was not from humour he had refu&s;ed to li&s;ten to his &s;ummons. That he was not frighted with the general's threats to de&s;troy the town; for he was not entru&s;ted with the care of the hou&s;es, but the fortications."</P>
<P>Laudohn had al&s;o &s;ent in a memo|rial in the &s;ame menacing &s;tile, where he thought it might have a greater effect, to the civil magi&s;trates, hop|ing that the ruin with which the town was threatened, might induce them to join with the inhabitants, to per&s;uade the governor to a &s;peedy &s;urrender.</P>
<P>All the&s;e menacing mea&s;ures &s;eemed to argue a fear in Baron Laudohn, that the Ru&s;&s;ians were not
<PB N="151" REF="167">
&s;o near as he pretended, and that the town might po&s;&s;ibly be relieved before their arrival. However he &s;hewed them, at nine of the very evening of the me&s;&s;age, that his threats were not vain, by a terrible di&s;charge of mortars and red hot balls that fell in an uninterrupted &s;hower upon the city until mid|night. During this fierce bombard|ment, that made a dreadful havock in the town, he attempted the out|works by a&s;&s;ault. His Croats at|tacked the covered way in many places at once, with the u&s;ual im|petuo&s;ity of tho&s;e brave irregulars; but they were received and repul&s;ed with re&s;olution equal to their own, and with more &s;teadine&s;s.</P>
<P>The operation of this dreadful night, having made no impre&s;&s;ion on the inflexible determination of the governor, Baron Laudohn had once more recour&s;e to negotiation. He now changed his &s;tile, and held out the mo&s;t flattering propo&s;itions; offering to grant him what capitula|tion he &s;hould think proper to a&s;k, and even to leave him&s;elf to draw up the articles. The governor replied that the firing the town had made no change in his re&s;olution; that he would wait with firmne&s;s for the enemy upon the ramparts; but that he could not help ob&s;erving, it was contrary to the laws of arms to be|gin the &s;iege of a fortre&s;s, by ruin|ing its inhabitants. The me&s;&s;enger made an&s;wer, that the trenches would be &s;oon opened. The go|vernor &s;aid, it was what he had long expected.</P>
<P>The Au&s;trians, foiled in their hopes from treaty, continued to bat|ter the town, and made &s;everal at|tempts upon the outworks for three days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. They found every po&s;t bravely defended; the Ru&s;&s;ian army did not appear, but they now began to perceive the approach of another army le&s;s agreeable; that of Prince Henry; which having marched with the utmo&s;t diligence from Great Glogau, now came fa&s;t upon him; and on the 5th of Au|gu&s;t, reached within a few miles of the town.</P>
<P>Laudohn did not think it expedient to put the advantage he had gained, and tho&s;e which he had yet to ex|pect from the management of time, to the i&s;&s;ue of a battle; he therefore decamped and made his retreat in good order, but with &s;ufficient quick|ne&s;s; having procured from this en|terpri&s;e only the wretched &s;atis|faction of reducing a great part of the city to a heap of rubbi&s;h, and of having revenged upon Bre&s;law &s;ome part of the &s;ufferings of Dre&s;den.</P>

<P>THE French and allied armies had been reinforced in the manner we have already mentioned. But the vigour of their operations did not altogether corre&s;ponded with what might have been expected from their &s;trength and mutual ani|mo&s;ity. The campaign, at lea&s;t in any effective manner, opened late. A country which had been &s;o long
<PB N="152" REF="168">
the theatre of &s;o ruinous a war, had been too much wa&s;ted to make the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and con&s;equently the free motion of the armies ea&s;y. The winter had been &s;evere and long; and it was not until the green forage appeared plentifully above ground, that tho&s;e great bodies of cavalry, which make &s;o large a part in our modern armies, were in a condition to act. The &s;ufferings of the Engli&s;h hor&s;e, from a want of dry forage, during a great part of the winter and the &s;pring had been extreme; this obliged them to fall much further back from the French cantonments; and to mole&s;t them le&s;s than they otherwi&s;e would have done. It was be&s;ides a lo&s;s, that at the opening of the campaign, they had not &s;o exten&s;ive a tract between them and Hanover; which by an artful choice of po&s;ts might have been yielded &s;tep by &s;tep, and the campaign &s;o managed and &s;pun out, that the &s;ea&s;on of action mu&s;t-have expired, before the French could have reaped any deci&s;ive advantage from their &s;uperiority.</P>
<P>Although the French were during the winter &s;upplied far better than the allies with all nece&s;&s;aries by the command of the Maine, the Mo&s;elle and the Rhine; and that the countries at their back had been much le&s;s con&s;umed by the war; yet the &s;ame difficulties embarra&s;&s;ed them as &s;oon as they thought of taking the field, and quitting their advantageous cantonments. There|fore there was a &s;lowne&s;s in the prin|cipal armies upon both parts, until the middle of &s;ummer.</P>
<P>Not however, but that &s;ome|thing was attempted in this interval, by le&s;&s;er parties. On the &s;ide of the Rhine, &s;ome actions happened between the army of St. Germain, and the corps of General Sporken, who was po&s;ted at Dulmen, to ob|&s;erve the French in that quarter. Dulmen formed the right flank of the chain of cantonments made by the allied army, which extended its left to the &s;outh-ea&s;t frontiers of the country of He&s;&s;e, above an hundred and fifty miles di&s;tant. The Here|ditary Prince who was on that wing, exerted, as much as circum&s;tances would permit, his u&s;ual activity and enterprize. He threw him&s;elf into the di&s;trict of Fulda; he laid it un|der an heavy contribution, and broke up &s;everal French corps that were po&s;ted there.</P>
<P>The&s;e actions decided nothing. The French army &s;uperior in num|ber, and in &s;ituation, advanced; and the allies, who &s;eemed to have cho&s;en the defen&s;ive, gradually re|tired. In effect, if the French had pur&s;ued their original plan, it would have proved almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for the allied army to maintain its ground. If St. Germain, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of Cleves, We&s;el, and Du&s;|&s;eldorp, had advanced on the &s;ide of Mun&s;ter; and M. Broglio mov|ing forward through the country of He&s;&s;e, had made a &s;trong de|tachment to the ea&s;tward of the We&s;er, whil&s;t with his main body he engaged the attention of Prince Ferdinand, the allies would &s;hortly have found them&s;elves enclo&s;ed up|on three &s;ides; and nothing could have extricated them but a capital victory obtained under every di&s;ad|vantage.</P>
<P>The French army was &s;ufficient|ly numerous for the&s;e operations. But it was &s;u&s;pected that the jealou|&s;y which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between M. de St. Germain and the Duke of Brog|lio prevented their being carried in|to execution. This mi&s;under&s;tand|ing
<PB N="153" REF="169">
daily increa&s;ed. In&s;omuch, that M. Broglio thought fit to order the corps of St. Germain to unite it&s;elf with the grand army. The count, who could not brook obe|dience to a younger officer, and one be&s;ides with whom he was not on the be&s;t terms, retired from the &s;ervice. He had only &s;erved before upon con|dition <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 23</NOTE> of commanding an army en|tirely di&s;tinct, and under his own particular orders. This difference deprived France of one of its mo&s;t able generals, and di&s;concerted one of its mo&s;t promi&s;ed &s;chemes of operation.</P>
<P>Before this mi&s;under&s;tanding had produced the&s;e effects, the affairs of the French went on with all imagi|nable pro&s;perity. The principal army not retarding it&s;elf, by con|&s;ideration of the places of &s;trength which the allies po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in their front, the ca&s;tles of Marburg and Dillenbourg, pu&s;hed forward into the landgraviate of He&s;&s;e, leaving detachments to reduce tho&s;e for|tre&s;&s;es. The fir&s;t of which &s;urren|dered on the 30th of June, the latter held out to the 16th of July; but the garri&s;ons of both &s;urrendered pri&s;oners of war.</P>
<P>In the mean time whil&s;t M. Broglio advanced on <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 10.</NOTE> the &s;ide of He&s;&s;e; the corps of St. Germain had penetrated through the dutchy of We&s;tphalia, and the two armies joined near a place cal|led Corbach. The allied army had fallen back from the po&s;t they occu|pied at Fritzlar, and were retreat|ing towards the river Dymel. As yet they had received no advice of the dreaded junction of the French armies; but as it was ima|gined that the corps of St. Ger|main only moved that way, and the vanguard only of that corps could be arrived at Corbach, which could not be e&s;timated at more than 10,000 foot, and 17 &s;quadrons at the utmo&s;t, the Hereditary Prince formed a &s;cheme of attacking and driving them from that po&s;t.</P>
<P>When he had begun the attack, contrary to his expectation he found the enemy already formed; but it was now impo&s;&s;ible to recede. The action grew every moment more furious and bloody. The French &s;tood their ground with firmne&s;s, and the main army being extremely near, in&s;tead of being wa&s;ted in the action, they grew more numerous by the reinforcements that were con|tinually &s;ent.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation it was nece&s;&s;ary that the prince &s;hould make as &s;peedy a retreat as po&s;&s;ible; but the difficulty of drawing out of the field in the middle of the day, before an enemy quite fre&s;h, and every in|&s;tant reinforced, may be ea&s;ily ima|gined. To compleat this difficul|ty, &s;ome bodies of the German troops both hor&s;e and foot fell into great confu&s;ion. The enemy &s;aw it at the fir&s;t glance, and to in|crea&s;e it to the utmo&s;t di&s;order, pu&s;hed forward upon them with a numerous artillery and a large body of cavalry. The allied army &s;eem|ed to be in the way of inevitable ruin.</P>
<P>In this exigence the Heredi|tary Prince, as his la&s;t re&s;ource, put him&s;elf at the head of a &s;quadron of Bland's and Howard's regiments of dragoons. By the&s;e the uncom|mon heroi&s;m of their young lead|er was perfectly &s;econded. They charged the enemy with the utmo&s;t fury, &s;topped the career of their victorious hor&s;e; and enabled the allied battalions to make an undi&s;turb|ed retreat.</P>
<P>The Hereditary Prince was wound|ed
<PB N="154" REF="170">
in this action; about 900 men were killed, wounded, or pri&s;oners, fifteen pieces of cannon, the whole of the artillery, was left to the ene|my, but &s;till in their circum&s;tances to have avoided a total defeat, was in &s;ome &s;ort victory. The well|timed impetuo&s;ity of the Hereditary Prince, and the &s;pirit of the Engli&s;h hor&s;e, could not be too highly prai&s;ed. The prince retired to the main army of the allies, who had now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of the &s;trong po&s;t of Saxenhau&s;en: whil&s;t the French continued oppo&s;ite to them in the no le&s;s &s;trong po&s;t of Corbach, which they had acquired by their victory; and here for &s;ome time they watched each other.</P>
<P>The Hereditary Prince &s;uffered more by this check than from the wounds he had received. His mind, forgetful of his pain and weakne&s;s, only brooding over his defeat, &s;eek|ing out with anxiety an opportuni|ty of revenging his lo&s;s by &s;ome bold, &s;ignal, and unexpected &s;troke again&s;t the enemy. It was not long before an opportunity pre&s;ented it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Advice had been received, that among the detachments which the French employed to reduce tho&s;e fortre&s;&s;es which the allies had gar|ri&s;oned on their retreat, there was one very con&s;iderable, formed of French and Saxons, under Mon&s;. Glaubitz, moving towards Ziegen|hagen, a place of importance in the landgraviate of He&s;&s;e. The Here|ditary Prince undertook to relieve it, and for <NOTE PLACE="marg">14 July.</NOTE> that purpo&s;e &s;elected &s;ix batta|lious of the German troops, two brigades of hunters, a regi|ment of hu&s;&s;ars, and Elliot's light dragoons. Although this la&s;t corps was but ju&s;t arrived, had been newly rai&s;ed, and had never &s;een any kind of &s;ervice, the prince was &s;o well plea&s;ed with their coun|tenance, that he cho&s;e them pre|ferably to all others for this difficult enterprize and the event proved that he was not mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Glaubitz remained in the mo&s;t perfect &s;ecurity; he was under no &s;ort of apprehen&s;ion of being mole&s;ted by a detachment of an army at &s;ixty miles di&s;tance, under the eye, and as it were guard of a &s;uperior body which demanded all its attention; when on a &s;udden he found him&s;elf attacked with the <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 16.</NOTE> utmo&s;t violence. The Hereditary Prince having reconnoitred his po|&s;ition, made a detour of two leagues through woods and mountains, fell upon his left, whil&s;t the re&s;t of his troops climbed the mountains on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, and ru&s;hed with the &s;ame &s;pirit upon the right.</P>
<P>Glaubitz had &s;carce time to form his troops; and they were only formed to be immediately broken. They retired with precipitation, leaving their camp and all it con|tained to the enemy. The prince had &s;o di&s;po&s;ed his cavalry as to cut off the retreat of &s;ome; but the mo&s;t con&s;iderable part gained ground upon him. On this occa|&s;ion he relied entirely on Elliot's hor&s;e, as it was altogether impo&s;|&s;ible for the infantry, already hara&s;|&s;ed by the action, and a mo&s;t fa|tiguing forced march of two days, to follow them. At the head of this hor&s;e he overtook the fugitives as they came out of a wood, charg|ed and broke through them five different times, &s;eparated a body of 500 from the re&s;t, &s;urrounded them and obliged them to throw down their arms. Having routed this, with the like rapidity, he flew to
<PB N="155" REF="171">
another body who had taken po&s;t near a wood, &s;urrounded them in the &s;ame manner; &s;ummoned and re|ceived them all pri&s;oners of war. A regiment of the enemy's hu&s;&s;ars was entirely cut to pieces. Nothing was wanting to compleat his victory. Elliot's light hor&s;e, proud to be led on by the prince him&s;elf, and worthy of that honour, had the greate&s;t &s;hare of the glory and &s;uf|ferings of that day. So young a corps had never &s;o eminently di|&s;tingui&s;hed it&s;elf. No more than 79 of the allies were killed in this action, but of the&s;e 71 were of this &s;ingle regiment.</P>
<P>The numbers of the enemy kil|led is not known, but for a time the &s;laughter was terrible. General Glaubitz him&s;elf was made pri&s;oner, together with the Prince of Anhalt. There were be&s;ides 177 officers, and 2482 private men. A greater num|ber of pri&s;oners could &s;carcely be expected from a victory in a general engagement. The trophies were nine pair of colours, and &s;ix pieces of cannon. In all the <HI>Petite Guerre</HI> of this campaign, (and the campaign between the French and the allies was almo&s;t wholly made up of &s;uch,) this was by far the mo&s;t brilliant action; and alone might have e&s;tabli&s;hed the reputation of the Hereditary Prince, if any thing had been wanting to e&s;tabli&s;h him the fir&s;t man of his age, in that &s;pe|cies of war. He returned to the camp of Saxenhau&s;en, without mo|le&s;tation, having fully revenged the affair at Corbach.</P>
<P>Prince Ferdinand did not remain long after this action in his camp at Saxenhau&s;en. By &s;o advanced a po&s;ition, the landgraviate, and even Hanover, lay too open to the enemies incur&s;ions. He therefore took his camp at a place called Kal|le, in a &s;ituation nearer to Ca&s;&s;el. On this M. Broglio formed a plan, which the greatne&s;s of his army in &s;ome &s;ort enabled him to execute. The Chevalier de Muy, who com|manded in the room of the Count St. Germain, was ordered to cro&s;s the Dymel at Statbergen, with his re&s;erve, con&s;i&s;ting of 35,000 men, in order to cut off the al|lies from their communication with We&s;tphalia. Whil&s;t the re&s;t of the French, dividing them&s;elves into two bodies, moved, the main army under M. Broglio towards Duke Ferdinand's camp at Kalle, the re|&s;erve under Prince Xavier of Saxony towards Ca&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>The&s;e important movements o|bliged Prince Ferdinand to &s;et him|&s;elf al&s;o in motion; and as he was not in a condition to make detach|ments of &s;ufficient &s;trength, he cro&s;|&s;ed the Dymel with his grand army, in order to fight the chevalier de Muy.</P>
<P>His &s;erene highne&s;s formed his main body on the heights of Corbach, and moved <NOTE PLACE="marg">31 July.</NOTE> towards the enemy, who were ad|vantageou&s;ly po&s;ted near War|bourg; in the mean time the Hereditary Prince with two co|lumns wheeled round the enemies left, and began a vigorous attack at once upon that flank, and upon their rear. The French command|er poured reinforcements on that quarter. An hot engagement was there maintained with equal ob&s;ti|nacy for near four hours. Whil&s;t this combat continued with uncer|tain fortune on the left, Prince Fer|dinand cau&s;ed &s;ome bodies to file off towards the French bridges on the Dymel to their right, by which he propo&s;ed to attack al&s;o on that &s;ide, and intercept them on their re|treat;
<PB N="156" REF="172">
at the &s;ame time the main of his army advanced with the utmo&s;t expedition to charge the enemy in front.</P>
<P>The French now &s;aw them&s;elves in the mo&s;t imminent danger of being &s;urrounded. Already their left, attacked in flank and rear by the Hereditary Prince, began to give way: his fire became every moment &s;uperior; and the earlie&s;t retreat was the &s;afe&s;t.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Prince Ferdinand per|ceived the enemy to retire, he &s;aw it was ab&s;olutely in vain to think of bringing his infantry upon their front. The Engli&s;h cavalry al&s;o, upon which he chiefly confided, was too di&s;tant to give almo&s;t any hope that they could be made to act. But the Engli&s;h cavalry out-did his ex|pectations, and indeed all former examples. They con&s;idered them|&s;elves as defrauded of their &s;hare of the glory of Minden: and they panted for an occa&s;ion of &s;ignalizing their courage; and their command|ers, Lord Granby and Mo&s;tyn, for|warded their ardour, knowing that great actions are commonly tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ions of ordinary rules.</P>
<P>They came up five miles on a full trot, (the Germans called it a gallop) without being blown, with|out the lea&s;t confu&s;ion or di&s;order, and attacked the enemies cavalry and infantry &s;everal times. The great|e&s;t part of the enemies hor&s;e fell back and did not &s;tand the charge. The Engli&s;h artillery were brought up with the &s;ame &s;urprizing quick|ne&s;s, and employed with the &s;ame powerful effect. Captain Phillips had done more with artillery than had been thought po&s;&s;ible at Min|den; and he exceeded it at War|bourg. The Engli&s;h foot vied with the cavalty and artillery, and made &s;uch earne&s;t efforts to come to action, that in &s;training their pa&s;&s;age thro' mora&s;&s;y ground and in burning weather, &s;everal &s;oldiers dropped down on their march. But they were too late to engage, and proba|bly in their wa&s;ted condition it was well that it &s;o happened.</P>
<P>The French made a precipitate retreat towards Statberg; &s;everal were drowned in pa&s;&s;ing the Dymel; 1500 were left on the field of battle; as many were made pri|&s;oners. Ten pieces of cannon were taken; but they con&s;oled them|&s;elves in having lo&s;t no colours. The lo&s;s of the allied army in gene|ral has not been, that I can find, publi&s;hed. That of the Engli&s;h in killed, wounded, and mi&s;&s;ing, was 590, but then the battle lay chiefly on them, and the killed in|cluded in that number were but about 130.</P>
<P>So brilliant a &s;ucce&s;s following clo&s;e on the heels of the former, rai&s;ed the reputation of the allied arms. As con&s;iderable an advan|tage might have well been expected from it; but according to the u&s;ual play of fortune in this war, the fir&s;t account that followed the de|feat of &s;o large a part of the French army, was, that with a rapid and unre&s;i&s;ted tide of &s;ucce&s;s, they had reduced Ca&s;&s;el, Eimbach, and Zie|genhayn; by which they became ma&s;ters of the whole landgraviate of He&s;&s;e; that they had pu&s;hed into the king's territories, &s;eized upon Gottingen and Munden, and threa|tened Hanover it&s;elf. In &s;hort, al|mo&s;t the wor&s;t con&s;equences which could have ari&s;en from a defeat fol|lowed a victory; and whil&s;t in Eng|land we gave a loo&s;e to our joy on the &s;ucce&s;s of our arms, the French were taking the mo&s;t important places of our allies.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="173">
The fact was that Prince Ferdi|nand mu&s;t have been &s;en&s;ible, that in quitting his camp at Kalle and taking po&s;t to the northward of the Dymel, he in a great mea&s;ure laid open Ca&s;&s;el and the whole territory of He&s;&s;e to the French; nay, that by this movement nothing was left to hinder their entering the Ha|noverian dominions on the right of the We&s;er. But notwith&s;tanding the&s;e ri&s;ques, the &s;tep he took was prudent, and even nece&s;&s;ary. Had he &s;uffered the progre&s;s of the Che|valier de Muy, on the Dymel; had he permitted him to &s;trengthen his po&s;ts upon that river, his communi|cation with We&s;tphalia had been ine|vitably cut off, and of cour&s;e his &s;phere of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence greatly &s;treigh|tened. It would have had a wor&s;e effect. For he mu&s;t have entirely lo&s;t the command of the We&s;er, without which he could not have &s;tood his ground a moment; and he would on that lo&s;s have found him|&s;elf compelled to retire into the heart of Hanover, where he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;ari|ly be &s;treightened in his winter canton|ments, and where a blow of any con&s;e|quence mu&s;t be deci&s;ive again&s;t him.</P>
<P>He therefore fought the battle of Warbourg though he lo&s;t all He&s;&s;e by his victory; and he would not quit his po&s;ts on the Dymel, though he &s;aw Gottingen and Mun|den in the hands of the French. He was not to be frighted from his &s;teady and well cho&s;en plan, by vain rumours or threatening ap|pearances. He was by no means in a condition to make large detach|ments; it was therefore nece&s;&s;ary to &s;acrifice &s;omething; and he made the &s;malle&s;t &s;acrifice that cir|cum&s;tances would admit. For he fore&s;aw that the French army whil&s;t he kept his po&s;ition on the Dymel, could not po&s;&s;ibly take up their quarters in Hanover, or even act there in any con&s;iderable body, and for any con&s;iderable time, without &s;ubjecting them&s;elves to the &s;ame or greater inconveniencies than tho&s;e to which he would have been him&s;elf liable, had he in de|fending He&s;&s;e &s;uffered them to oc|cupy tho&s;e critical po&s;ts on the Dymel. He knew farther, that it would prove extremely dangerous for them to hazard them&s;elves be|yond Gottingen; and that it would be more difficult for the French army to &s;upport them&s;elves in that advanced po&s;t, than for him to annoy them there.</P>
<P>It is po&s;&s;ible that rea&s;ons &s;ome|what like the foregoing, together with others probably far more co|gent, might have determined that great commander to this conduct. But whil&s;t he &s;ecured that middle communication, and acted upon the defen&s;ive plan, the troops were not idle; his detachments acted in many parts with &s;pirit and effect. But we mu&s;t defer for a while the narrative of the&s;e actions, being called from this part of the theatre to the ea&s;tern parts of Germany, where a|bout this time &s;cenes of greater eclat were opened.</P>

<P>FROM the time that the King of Pru&s;&s;ia found him&s;elf com|pelled to rai&s;e the &s;iege of Dre&s;den, it was evident that he could have no hope of acting in Saxony to any good purpo&s;e. The bu&s;y part of the campaign came on fa&s;t. Though Prince Henry had obliged Laudohn to retire from Bre&s;law; that gene|ral, able, and lately victorious, was &s;till formidable; he kept Nei&s;&s;e and Schweidnitz blocked up; and waited to effect a junction with the Ru&s;&s;ians, by which he pro|po&s;ed to give the final blow to the king's power in Sile&s;ia. The Ru&s;&s;ians had now actually arrived in the frontier parts of that province, and wanted but a very few days ea&s;y march to compleat that fatal and long dreaded junction. At the &s;ame time another body of Ru&s;&s;ians had penetrated into Pomerania; laid all the defencele&s;s parts under con|tribution; and threatened the &s;iege of Colberg. The Swedi&s;h army, &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t of 22,000 men, com|menced al&s;o, tho' with le&s;s vigour, their operations. In all that country the King of Pru&s;&s;ia had not 5000 men to oppo&s;e them.</P>
<P>In the&s;e circum&s;tances a plan of mere defence would have proved altogether without effect. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia had but two armies; and it was nece&s;&s;ary that one of them, at lea&s;t, &s;hould make the mo&s;t rapid and &s;udden movements to op|po&s;e &s;o many combinations. On the &s;ide of Sile&s;ia the danger &s;eem|ed mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing, and accordingly he marched to its relief; advanced near two hun|dred <NOTE PLACE="marg">30th July.</NOTE> miles, and left Mar&s;hal Daun, who had con&s;iderably the &s;tart, far behind him. This march would have been thought an a&s;toni&s;hing exploit in a partizan at the head of a &s;mall and di&s;encumbered corps: but that a numerous army, clogged with its artillery, with a|bove two thou&s;and waggons, &s;hould in that time traver&s;e &s;uch a &s;pace, &s;hould pa&s;s the Elbe, the Spree, the Nei&s;&s;e, the Quei&s;s, and the Bober, five con&s;iderable rivers; that they &s;hould effect all this, with one army of the enemy on one &s;ide of its flanks, another behind, and with a third in its front (the actual po&s;ition of the Au&s;trians in Lu|&s;atia) was an action re&s;erved for, and only to be expected from the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. The attempt it&s;elf could have been ju&s;tified only by nece&s;&s;ity; and the nece&s;&s;ity was urgent. The Ru&s;&s;ians approached. M. Daun fol|lowed towards Sile&s;ia; and the king could hardly promi&s;e him&s;elf &s;ucce&s;s, but from a march of &s;uch ra|pidity, as might enable him to try his fortune with General Laudohn, before the triple junction he apprehended had made his enemies irre&s;i&s;tible.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="175">
But notwith&s;tanding the hopes conceived from this march, before the king could come to an action three bodies of Au&s;trians had joined, Laudohn's, Daun's, and Lacy's; and extending them&s;elves along the Kat&s;bach, a river which falls into the Oder, occupied all the ground from Parchwitz to Co&s;&s;endau, a &s;pace of little le&s;s than thirty Eng|li&s;h miles. But in this extent, their po&s;ts were every where &s;trong, and their communications ea&s;y. The king's camp was at Lignitz. It was in vain that for &s;everal days he at|tempted, by various devices, to de|tach one body of the enemy from the re&s;t, or to turn their flanks and attack them at di&s;advantage. The nature of the ground or the &s;kill of the oppo&s;ite generals always di&s;ap|pointed him.</P>
<P>At length M. Daun took him&s;elf the offen&s;ive party. The advan|tage of his &s;ituation, and the &s;u|periority of his numbers, prevailed over his cautious nature to ri&s;que an attack. It was therefore re&s;olved, after the &s;ituation of Lignitz had been well reconnoitred, all circum|&s;tances maturely weighed, and the de&s;ign communicated to the other generals, to attempt the King of Pru&s;&s;ia in his camp, with the united &s;trength of the three armies. To en&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s beyond a doubt, it was determined that this attempt &s;hould be made by &s;urprize, and therefore in the night. M. Daun remembered the bad guard which had been kept by the Pru&s;&s;ians; and the advantage, which in the year 1758 he derived from a night attack at the battle of Hohkirchen.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this plan the whole army, as &s;oon as it &s;hould begin to grow dark, was to march from their &s;everal po&s;ts to &s;uch &s;itu|ations as were marked out for each corps; they were to &s;trike their tents, but yet to keep up the fires in their camps, and to have the drums beat the tattoo as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>Some time after Mar&s;hal Daun had begun to move, to his a&s;toni&s;h|ment the patroles he had &s;ent out returned with the account, that they had met no out-po&s;ts. As &s;oon as day broke and the army had ad|vanced, their apprehen&s;ions were confirmed. They were di&s;appoint|ed in their de&s;ign, there was no enemy in the camp; but when they ca&s;t their eyes from thence, they could perceive at a di&s;tance the ri&s;ing of a thick &s;moke, which left them no room to doubt that their fortune was then on the point of deci&s;ion, by a part of their forces only, and that the king and Baron Laudohn were on that moment hotly engaged; Daun could only look on and wait the event.</P>
<P>On the 13th of July the king was in his camp at Lignitz, when he received advice that the Ru&s;&s;ian army of 24,000 men, under Count Czernichew, had thrown bridges o|ver the Oder, at a place called Au|ras, and that they were to pa&s;s the river on that very day. He &s;u&s;pect|ed al&s;o, that the enemy had formed the de&s;ign of a general attack. Troops which have been a long time op|po&s;ed to each other can reciprocally gue&s;s at each other's de&s;igns; the method u&s;ed by the enemies ge|nerals grows familiar, and the lea&s;t motion they make di&s;clo&s;es their de&s;igns.</P>
<P>This is the account the Pru&s;&s;ians gave of the means by which they came to a knowledge of M. Daun's projects. The Au&s;trians attributed this di&s;covery, not to the Pru&s;&s;ian &s;a|gacity, but to intelligence given by de&s;erters.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="176">
Whatever the means were by which the King of Pru&s;&s;ia became &s;u&s;picious of this de&s;ign, it is cer|tain, that he took the mo&s;t early, the mo&s;t vigorous, and the mo&s;t effective mea&s;ures to defeat it. He thoroughly &s;en&s;ible of the danger he ran of being &s;urrounded, if he continued in his po&s;t at Lig|nitz; out of that very de&s;ign, which was calculated for his ruin, his genius drew a new means of &s;afety. He &s;aw at a glance, that the plan which the enemy had formed to &s;urround him, at the &s;ame time, nece&s;&s;arily divided their own armies. And this divi&s;ion was the great object he had pur&s;ued &s;o long, and thro' &s;uch di&s;couraging di&s;appointments. His only bu&s;ine&s;s was to prevent their reuniting in a general attack upon his quarters. Therefore in the very evening calcu|lated for the attempt on his camp, he quitted it with as much privacy as the enemy had propo&s;ed to attack it, marched and took an advantageous po&s;t on the way through which Lau|dohn was to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>And now the deci&s;ive hour ap|proached, in which he was to put to the ri&s;que as great a &s;take as had been play'd for &s;ince the begin|ning of the war. No vulgar ad|vantage would &s;uffice in his &s;itua|tion, and that very &s;ituation in &s;ome &s;ort di&s;abled him from attain|ing a great one. After four bloody campaigns, and the vici&s;&s;itudes of a &s;ucce&s;s in all its changes exhau&s;ting, his old corps was nearly annihilated. Tho&s;e who &s;ucceeded to their places, had &s;carcely &s;een the brilliant times of the king's fortune; and they in|herited neither the &s;evere di&s;cipline, nor the undaunted &s;pirit of the fir&s;t companions of his hopes; they were new to &s;ervice, yet di&s;pirited with defeats. The king him&s;elf gave life to the whole, he alone was to rectify a thou&s;and faults, and to &s;up|ply a thou&s;and deficiencies.</P>
<P>The po&s;t which he cho&s;e, was &s;uch, as whil&s;t it &s;topped the progre&s;s of Laudohn in front, if Daun &s;hould attempt his rear, would from the nature of the ground lay him under great difficulties. This rear he fur|ther &s;trengthened with &s;everal bat|teries. As &s;oon as his army was drawn up, he divided it, leaving his right on the ground, where it had been formed to ob&s;erve Mar&s;hal Daun and to maintain that po&s;t; whil&s;t with his left he turned in order to fall upon the corps under Laudohn. No di&s;po&s;itions could have been made with a more perfect &s;kill.</P>
<P>Meantime Laudohn was advancing fa&s;t to the &s;nare which had been laid for him. Already he had pa&s;&s;ed the Kat&s;bach, and was moving towards Lignitz, full of the hopes of no &s;mall &s;hare in the glory of giving the final blow to the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, and had advanced as far as the vil|lage of P&s;affendorf, when by three in the morning, the day-light began to dawn; a thick fog that had covered all the adjoining grounds &s;uddenly cleared up, and like the opening of a great &s;cene di&s;clo&s;ed at once the whole Pru&s;&s;ian army, regularly em|battled, advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted, fur|ni&s;hed with a dreadful and well|placed artillery.</P>
<P>He was now come full upon his enemy. It <NOTE PLACE="marg">15th Aug.</NOTE> was impo&s;&s;ible to recede; the &s;ur|prize he intended was turned upon him&s;elf. But this able general, though &s;urprized, was not di&s;or|dered. The be&s;t di&s;po&s;itions were made that the time would admit; a &s;harp and ob&s;tinate combat began; which continued without giving way on either &s;ide, until &s;ix. The King
<PB N="161" REF="177">
of Pru&s;&s;ia exerted him&s;elf with in|credible diligence to pre&s;erve an uni|form &s;trength in every part of his line, and hazarded his own life with a daring, which nothing but his &s;ituation could excu&s;e from te|merity. His cloaths were &s;hot through in &s;everal places, his hor&s;e was killed under him. But all the&s;e troubles and dangers were fully compen&s;ated by the efforts of his troops, who maintained &s;o &s;teady a fire, and pu&s;hed the Au&s;trians with &s;o much ardour, that they at la&s;t gave ground, and retreated with precipitation, though not without &s;ome order, towards the Kat&s;bach.</P>
<P>The king pur&s;ued them to this river, and no further. His advan|tage as it was gained by the mo&s;t vigorous &s;teps, &s;o bounds were &s;et to the ardour of improving it with the mo&s;t guarded caution. He feared if he pur&s;ued his &s;ucce&s;s too far, it might disjoin the part of the army engaged from that which he had left to ob&s;erve M. Daun; and perhaps give that general an opportunity of taking a &s;evere revenge on the right, for the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es of the left. Notwith&s;tanding this re&s;erve of the king, (a re&s;erve, the want of which was formerly the only failing in his military charac|ter, but which his misfortunes had now perfectly taught him,) notwith|&s;tanding, I &s;ay he did not pu&s;h his good fortune again&s;t Baron Laudohn to the utmo&s;t, the victory was com|pleat, glorious, and adorned with all the trophies. By their own confe&s;|&s;ion, the Au&s;trians lo&s;t upwards of 6000 men, killed, wounded and pri|&s;oners. The Pru&s;&s;ians made it a|mount, and not without probability, to 10,000. Among the pri&s;oners, were two generals, and 84 officers; 82 pieces of cannon and 23 pair of colours were taken. On the &s;ide of the conquerors, five hundred were killed, and 1200 wounded.</P>
<P>With regard to Sile&s;ia, the victory near Lignitz produced &s;ome mo&s;t immediate, and mo&s;t u&s;eful effects. Although M. Daun, not di&s;pirited with his late mi&s;adventure, and only &s;ollicitous to repair his lo&s;s, had detached a &s;trong corps under Prince Lowen&s;tein, and Gen. Beck to &s;trenghthen the Ru&s;&s;ians and en|courage them to advance, Count Czernichew was &s;o intimidated with the late defeat of the Au&s;trians, that he repa&s;&s;ed the Oder by the &s;ame bridges on which he had lately cro&s;&s;ed it.</P>
<P>Thus one great end of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's march was obtained. He prevented the dreaded junction of tho&s;e two powers. In the other part of his de&s;ign, he did not &s;o perfectly &s;ucceed. M. Daun &s;ince the action of P&s;affendorf, could in|deed make no progre&s;s in Sile&s;ia; but on the other hand, the king was not able entirely to drive him out of that province. The Au&s;trians even after their defeat, far &s;uperior to the king, had been be&s;ides largely reinforced. The empre&s;s exerted all her power, to remove the ill effect this late check might have had on the reputation of her arms; at the &s;ame time that &s;he augmented her troops, &s;he com|forted and encouraged Baron Lau|dohn, and by a very generous and gracious letter let him &s;ee, that &s;he was not a &s;overeign, in who&s;e mind a late misfortune cancels the memory of pa&s;t &s;ervices. In the prai&s;es which this letter be&s;towed on Laudohn, &s;everal were of opinion, was couched an indirect cen&s;ure on the conduct of Count Daun, the &s;lowne&s;s of who&s;e temper &s;o ill
<PB N="162" REF="178">
agreed with the ardour of her am|bition, and with the&s;e great hopes, which the number of her forces, and the &s;trength of her alliance had encouraged her to entertain.</P>
<P>The king after this victory joined his brother Prince Henry at New|marcke. One part of that prince's army under Gen. Goltze had pa&s;&s;ed the Oder to ob&s;erve the Ru&s;&s;ians, who &s;ince the repa&s;&s;ing that river, &s;eemed to direct their motions north|ward. The king being &s;trengthened by this junction, and having his communication with Bre&s;law clear, marched again&s;t Daun, who had begun to form the blockade of Schweidnitz, fell upon a corps under Gen. Beck; made two battalions of Croats pri&s;oners, di&s;per&s;ed &s;everal &s;quadrons, and by this lively affair obliged the enemy's grand army to rai&s;e the blockade, and by a pre|cipitate retreat, to take refuge in the mountains of Land&s;hut.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t his maje&s;ty was thus ex|erting the mo&s;t heroic efforts in de|fence of Sile&s;ia; Gen. Hul&s;en, who commanded for him in Saxony, &s;e|conded his endeavours in that quar|ter with uncommon bravery and &s;ucce&s;s. The army of the empire had formed a de&s;ign of cutting him off from Torgau. To fru&s;trate their intentions, that general quitted his camp at Mei&s;&s;en, and marched to Strehla. The enemy divided into two bodies; one attacked an advan|ced po&s;t about a cannon &s;hot from his camp upon every &s;ide, with the greate&s;t fury from day break to &s;ix <NOTE PLACE="marg">20 Aug.</NOTE> in the morning, whil&s;t ano|ther corps was &s;o placed as to keep his camp in awe, and to prevent his attempting any thing for the relief of the advanced po&s;t. Gen. Hul&s;en &s;aw that unle&s;s he could &s;peedily do &s;omething for its &s;uc|cour, that body mu&s;t inevitably pe|ri&s;h. He therefore in this exigency, gave orders to his cavalry to make a circuit round an height; and to charge if po&s;&s;ible the enemies flank. This order was executed with the utmo&s;t promptitude and &s;pirit. The Imperiali&s;ts were charged on their flank; their battalions and hor&s;e were thrown upon one another in confu&s;ion, and 41 officers and 1200 men were made pri&s;oners. The lo&s;s of the Pru&s;&s;ians was incon&s;ide|rable. Gen. Hul&s;en by this ad|vantage, was enabled to encamp under Torgau, while he retreated through an apprehen&s;ion, as the grand army of the Imperiali&s;ts was coming up, that he might be cut off from his communication with the Elbe. This retreat made the Au&s;trians magnify the affair into a victory on their &s;ide; but the cir|cum&s;tances render the Pru&s;&s;ian ac|count much more probable.</P>
<P>Fortune &s;eemed once more to have &s;miled, after a long interval of gloom on the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's af|fairs; and the reputation of his arms began to revive. But the vic|tories he obtained, though glorious, were deci&s;ive of little more than the field upon which they were fought. They were far from ha|ing lowered the power of the enemy to an equality with his. And the movements he made to gain tho&s;e advantages, and to pro|tect one part of his dominions ne|ce&s;&s;arily expo&s;ed the re&s;t. The enemy was able to detach without end; and whil&s;t bodies of Ru&s;&s;ians traver&s;ed the Lower Sile&s;ia, &s;everal corps of Au&s;trians &s;coured Lu&s;atia; and thus together they broke off all regular communication between the king's army and his hereditary do|minions, and of cour&s;e between him

and his general Hul&s;en, who with very unequal forces was &s;truggling to &s;ecure Saxony; a country in which there are towns indeed forti|fied; but fortified for the greater part in &s;uch a manner, as to be little more than &s;nares for increa&s;ing the number of pri&s;oners, by betraying defencele&s;s garri&s;ons into the hands of an enemy &s;uperior in the field.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation, the king is &s;aid to have wrote a letter to the cele|brated <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">Author of the Jewi&s;h Spy, &amp;c. and now re&s;ident at Berlin.</NOTE> Marq. d'Argens, very pathetick, and very de&s;criptive of his condition, and of his frame of mind under tho&s;e pre&s;&s;ures.

<P>WE leave the King of Pru&s;&s;ia to the&s;e thoughts, in order to return to the armies on the We&s;er. Pr. Ferdinand was not mi&s;taken, in imagining that Gottingen would prove the utmo&s;t bound of the French progre&s;s into Hanover. After they had &s;ecured that place with a &s;trong garri&s;on, the grand army of M. Broglio moved towards the re&s;erve which had been defeated, and pitch|ed his camp at Dierenberg, a place
<PB N="165" REF="182">
within a &s;mall di&s;tance of the allies, who ever &s;ince the battle continued to occupy Warbourg, the Dymel running between the two armies. In this &s;ituation they continued for a|bout a month.</P>
<P>The Hereditary Prince, who was ever in motion, and continually hovering now on one &s;ide, now on the other of the French camp, in one of his excur&s;ions had perceived that the French, according to their u&s;ual negligence, were not very exact in their out-po&s;ts and pa|trols. He had al&s;o received intel|ligence, that they had thrown a corps of hor&s;e and foot, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ome|thing more than two thou&s;and men, into the town of Zierenberg, a place &s;urrounded with &s;ome damaged walls.</P>
<P>From the&s;e lights, he re&s;olved upon the &s;urprize of this body, and accordingly made his di&s;po&s;itions for this bold attempt, in the man|ner following; fir&s;t, he ordered a body of his light troops to turn the town of Zierenberg, and to take po&s;t between it and Darien|berg, in order to intercept any that &s;hould attempt pa&s;&s;ing to the camp of the enemy. Next he po&s;ted at proper di&s;tances eight &s;quadrons of dragoons, two batta|lions of grendadiers, and one regi|ment of foot, on the road between his own camp and the place which was to be attacked, with a view to cover his retreat, in ca&s;e he &s;hould be repul&s;ed and pur&s;ued. With the re&s;t of his foot, con&s;i&s;ting for the greater part of Engli&s;h, he marched with the utmo&s;t caution and diligence towards the town.</P>
<P>When they had arri|ved within two miles, <NOTE PLACE="marg">5th Sept.</NOTE> they divided into three bodies, which took three different routs, by which the place was compleatly &s;urrounded. At eight in the evening, they &s;et out from Warbourg, and came before this place at two the following morning. Notwith&s;tand|ing the precautions taken, the trampling of the troops over the gardens gave the alarm to a guard of the enemies dragoons, who im|mediately began to fire. Strict or|ders had been given to proceed with as little alarm as po&s;&s;ible, and to re&s;erve their fire; and &s;uch was the deliberate courage, &s;uch the perfect di&s;cipline of the Engli&s;h grenadiers, that they &s;u&s;tained this fire, pu&s;hed on with bayonets, drove back the enemies piquets, killed the guard at the gate, and entered the town along with the fu|gitives, without the lea&s;t noi&s;e, hurry, or confu&s;ion. Never was &s;urprize more compleat.</P>
<P>The column of the Engli&s;h gre|nadiers having forced the gate, advanced regularly with their bay|onets fixed, and without fiting a mu&s;|quet, by the two &s;treets that led to the church-yard, (which being the only open part of the town, &s;erved the French as a place of arms,) killing or taking a great number of tho&s;e who ran from the hou&s;es towards this rendezvous; and thus they ad|vanced with the greate&s;t order and the mo&s;t profound &s;ilence, until they reached the church-yard. The night night was &s;o dark that they formed by the &s;ide of the French, who for a while took them to be their own pic|quets that had a&s;&s;embled; but they were &s;oon undeceived; a fierce en|counter with bayonets en&s;ued, in which the French were quickly ob|liged to give way.</P>
<P>Two regiments of the enemies dra|goons
<PB N="166" REF="183">
endeavoured to fly to the gate that led to their camp; but they found it occupied by 400 grenadiers, who drove them back with their bay|onets; forced from hence, they fled to another gate; there they were repul&s;ed with a &s;harp fire of &s;mall arms. Then they were compelled to &s;eparate; and flying at random as fortune and the night directed, made their e&s;cape at the &s;everal breaches of the wall. The prince was ma&s;ter of the place in about an hour; but the nearne&s;s of the French camp and the approach of day prevented as long a continuance in the place as he wi&s;hed for reaping the full fruits of his vic|tory; therefore about three o'clock he began his retreat, carrying off 2 pieces of cannon, 36 officers, and between 4 and 500 private men. The &s;laughter of the enemy was con&s;iderable. The prince reached his camp without the lea&s;t mole&s;ta|tion in his retreat.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider the difficulty of this attempt, very few have been bolder; if we examine the di&s;|po&s;itions, none could be conducted with greater wi&s;dom; if we attend to the behaviour of the troops, we &s;hall no where find an example of more exact obedience, di&s;cipline and courage. To attack &s;o large a body of the enemy, &s;o &s;trongly po&s;ted, within a little league of their grand camp, to march &s;o far in that critical &s;ituation, and in a very dark night, to divide into &s;o many parts, yet to act with &s;o much order and &s;o entire a concert, was certainly an exploit of the very fir&s;t rank; and though not of any great importance in its con&s;equences, is &s;o admirable in its conduct and execution, that it well de&s;erves to be told at the length we have given it. This added greatly to the reputa|tion of the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers as troops, and no le&s;s to their honour as men, by the humanity they &s;hewed to their pri&s;oners, and the generous &s;entiments of the common &s;ort with regard to money; as there were &s;everal noble in&s;tances that night of their refu&s;ing to take any thing from their pri&s;oners, who had offered them their pur&s;es. They lo&s;t but ten men.</P>
<P>From this time the operations of the two armies, which for a time &s;eemed to langui&s;h, were renewed with fre&s;h vigour. Prince Fer|dinand perceived, that whil&s;t the French communication with the Rhine and with Frankfort on the Maine continued open, it mu&s;t prove to little purpo&s;e to attempt any thing either for the relief of Gottingen or Ca&s;&s;el. Their progre&s;s indeed into Hanover had been checked; but whil&s;t ever they continued in &s;o advanced a po&s;ition, it was evi|dently impo&s;&s;ible to prevent their making very ruinous inroads into that country. To force them to a battle again&s;t their inclination, would be difficult, and the attempt it&s;elf dangerous. There remained but one method, which was to make fre|quent and &s;trong detachments into the &s;outhern parts of He&s;&s;e and Wet|teravia, and thus render precarious the French communication with the Rhine and Maine, from whence they drew the greate&s;t part of their &s;up|plies of all kinds.</P>
<P>With this intention, he detached General Bulow at the head of a &s;trong corps, who pu&s;hed forward toward Marpurg, &s;urprized the town, de&s;troyed the French ovens, with &s;e|veral hundred waggons of flour, and carried off a con&s;iderable quantity of cloathing and military &s;tores. In the mean time, his light troops &s;cour|ed the country in &s;uch a manner
<PB N="167" REF="184">
as for a while an&s;wered the great end of the expedition in breaking the French comunication with Frankfort. Proceeding on this plan he made a further movement towards Fran|kenau, which, at length, nece&s;&s;itat|ed the French general Stainville, who commanded in tho&s;e parts, to quit his po&s;ition, and endeavour to &s;top the progre&s;s of this detachment. He came up with their rear as they were pa&s;|&s;ing <NOTE PLACE="marg">13 Sept.</NOTE> the river Orche, and falling upon them at this di&s;advantage with &s;uperior numbers and great fury, he entirely routed the rear; and took &s;ome men and a very great number of hor&s;es.</P>
<P>It was to be apprehended that he might have pur&s;ued this advantage, to the entire ruin of M. Bulow's de|tachment; if the Hereditary Prince by a forced march of five German miles had not arrived time enough to &s;upport him. On the prince's arrival M. Stainville fell back, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;trong po&s;t in which it was in vain to attack him.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e mea&s;ures were tak|ing with mixed &s;ucce&s;s for di&s;quiet|ing the French, and interrupting their communication to the &s;outh|ward of their quarters, like move|ments were made to the northward, to oblige them, if po&s;&s;ible, to relin|qui&s;h their hold on Gottingen. But General Wangenheim, who with that de&s;ign had cro&s;&s;ed the We&s;er, and in the beginning had proceeded with no &s;mall expectations; but at length he received a &s;evere <NOTE PLACE="marg">19. Sept.</NOTE> check, which forced him to repa&s;s the river with &s;ome pre|cipitation. However the&s;e frequent detachments an&s;wered &s;o well the end of hara&s;&s;ing the French, that on the 20th they retired from Im|menhau&s;en, and fell back upon Ca&s;|&s;el where they began to entrench them&s;elves. Prince Ferdinand followed them clo&s;e; and the better to ob&s;erve their motions, fixed his quarters as near as he could to tho&s;e of the enemy.</P>
<P>But whil&s;t the grand armies thus watched each other, the Eyes of Europe were drawn to a different quarter, by a movement equally a|&s;toni&s;hing for its rapidity and my&s;te|rious for its de&s;ign. The Heredi|tary Prince of Brun&s;wick, whom we have &s;een but a few days before in the furthe&s;t part of He&s;&s;e, &s;uddenly appeared on the frontiers of the United Provinces, with an army of twenty battalions and ten &s;quadrons. One detachment of his troops which had proceeded on the &s;ide of Du&s;&s;el|dorp, pa&s;&s;es the Rhine above Roe|root; another which had marched through Mun&s;ter, pa&s;&s;es it nearly about the &s;ame time, but a great di&s;tance below, at Rhees; the&s;e two detachments move to meet each other, and as they proceed, &s;eize all the French po&s;ts along the Rhine; the enemy's guards are every where taken or abandon their redoubts. This puts into their po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion a number of boats, by which they are enabled to tran&s;port all the re&s;t of the troops which are in|tended to act upon the left of the Rhine. Then they proceed without delay or oppo&s;ition directly to Cleves; the garri&s;on <NOTE PLACE="marg">3d Oct.</NOTE> takes refuge in the ca&s;tle, which is vigorou&s;ly attacked, and in three days &s;urrenders 500 men pri&s;oners of war. Whil&s;t this was performed by one body, another had laid &s;iege to We&s;el, and battered the place with &s;o much fury, that the reduc|tion of it appeared certain; and with it the entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Lower Rhine almo&s;t from Du&s;&s;eldorp to Cleves.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="185">
The &s;ecrecy, and the rapidity of the march, together with the vigour of the &s;ub&s;equent operations, were &s;uch as might be expected from the character of the Hereditary Prince; but on what de&s;ign this rapid march was made, and the&s;e vigorous &s;teps ta|ken at that particular time, gave room for a great deal of rea&s;oning. During a good part of the &s;ummer, very great preparations had been made in Eng|land for a conjunct expedition; a powerful fleet was in readine&s;s; and they had embarked a large train of field and battering artillery, a con|&s;iderable body of foot, and a regi|ment of light hor&s;e.</P>
<P>As this armament was &s;uppo&s;ed in readine&s;s to &s;ail about the time of the Hereditary Prince's march to the Rhine, conjecture united the&s;e two de&s;igns together, and &s;uppo&s;ed the fleet at Port&s;mouth and the army in We&s;tphalia, were to act on the &s;ame plan. On this &s;uppo&s;ition it was judged that the &s;torm would proba|bly fall on the Au&s;trian Netherlands; and that O&s;tend, which the Em|pre&s;s &s;o unpolitically for her&s;elf, and &s;o ungratefully to her former friends, had given into the hands of France, would be the fir&s;t object of tho&s;e forces which were to unite from &s;uch a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>This de&s;ign of the expedition from Port&s;mouth has, we under|&s;tand, been formally di&s;avowed. Whether in &s;trictne&s;s, not being a principal in the war, with her im|perial maje&s;ty, England ought to have made &s;uch an attempt, though O&s;tend was defended by a French garri&s;on, we &s;hall not take upon us to determine; but without the aid of &s;uch con&s;iderations, it is evi|dent there were &s;ufficient objections to it from the &s;ide of mere prudence. Almo&s;t in&s;uperable difficulties oc|curred in &s;uch a &s;cheme; and it would &s;carcely appear to mo&s;t men advi&s;eable to add a Flemi&s;h to our German war.</P>
<P>But we think it po&s;&s;ible to give &s;ome rea&s;onable account of the ex|pedition of the Hereditary Prince, independent of any connection with the Briti&s;h armament. For a con&s;i|derable time the French had &s;eemed re&s;olved to re&s;ume their former plan of an army on the Lower Rhine; &s;uch motions were made as &s;trongly indicated that this de&s;ign would &s;hort|ly be put in execution; and the allied army had every thing to fear from it. For as the French were checked from proceeding to the complete conque&s;t of the electorate by the allied army on the Dymel, if this army &s;hould it&s;elf be &s;o check|ed, by one of the enemy advancing from the Lower Rhine, there would be then nothing to hinder M. Broglio from &s;ending forward &s;o &s;trong a re|&s;erve as might finally reduce Hanover. In the&s;e circum&s;tances nothing but a very deci&s;ive victory could po&s;&s;ibly &s;ave the allied army, thus &s;urround|ed and deprived of its &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, from peri&s;hing in the mo&s;t mi&s;erable, or &s;urrendering in the mo&s;t &s;hameful manner.</P>
<P>There was one &s;tep only which might with certainty prevent this de&s;ign, and even in &s;ome mea&s;ure turn it upon the enemy; the tak|ing Cleves and Wefel into the hands of the allies. This would not only defeat the &s;cheme of the French for acting on the Lower Rhine, but greatly embarra&s;s their operations in every other quar|ter. Even the attempt, though it &s;hould not be attempted with &s;ucce&s;s, would nece&s;&s;arily draw the attention of the French that way, and thus &s;ave Hanover at lea&s;t for one
<PB N="169" REF="186">
campaign. This alone had been a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for the march. But had the Briti&s;h armament at the &s;ame time been intended for &s;ome part of the coa&s;t of France, or had England politically kept up &s;uch a rumour, when &s;he had in reality a more remote object for her ar|mament; in either of the&s;e ca&s;es it would undoubtedly have co-operat|ed with the Hereditary Prince's de|&s;igns, by detaining a greater body of the French troops at home to defend their own coa&s;ts.</P>
<P>We do not pretend to penetrate into all the motives. But it is evi|dent, that in the German enter|pri&s;e every thing depended on the celerity of the operations. The &s;iege of We&s;el was carried on with great vigour, by that part of the prince's army which was on the right of the Rhine, whil&s;t the prince covered it on the left. But before the enemy could di&s;turb him, nature declared again&s;t his &s;ucce&s;s by the fall of immen&s;e rains, which &s;welled the Rhine and Lippe to &s;uch a degree as greatly inter|rupted the progre&s;s of the &s;iege, having rendered the roads of We&s;t|phalia impa&s;&s;able, and therefore prevented the arrival of the&s;e rein|forcements which were intended to pu&s;h the &s;iege with the greater ef|fect. The&s;e rains al&s;o made it very difficult for the prince to pre|&s;erve his communication with the be&s;iegers, which however he made a &s;hift to keep open by one bridge above and another below the town.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the French with all the expedition they could u&s;e, had collected an army under M. de Ca&s;tries of thirty battalions and thirty-eight &s;quadrons, partly from the great army in He&s;&s;e, partly from the Low Countries. This body advanced as far as Rheinberg, and after a &s;trenuous re&s;i&s;tance drove out a detachment of the allies which had been po&s;ted there. From thence they marched by their left, and en|camped behind the convent of Campen. The Hereditary Prince now &s;aw at the &s;ame time the &s;ea|&s;on and a &s;uperior army acting a|gain&s;t him; to fight this enemy, fully prepared to receive him, with the troops which he could &s;pare from the &s;iege, might be a de&s;perate at|tempt. To break up the &s;iege would have of it&s;elf an&s;wered the intention of the enemies march. There was no medium but a &s;ur|prize; which was re&s;olved, and all the di&s;po&s;itions for it made with the judgment by which the great prince who commanded is di&s;tin|gui&s;hed upon &s;uch difficult occa|&s;ions. This attempt became the more nece&s;&s;ary, and the le&s;s time was to be lo&s;t in making it, as intelligence had been received that the French army was &s;hortly to be augmented by powerful reinforce|ments. The prince began his march at ten in the evening.</P>
<P>To reach the enemies camp, it was nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;lodge Fi&s;cher's corps of irregulars, who had occupied the convent of Campen in their front. This produced &s;ome &s;hot, and this &s;hot alarmed the <NOTE PLACE="marg">16th Oct.</NOTE> whole French army, which immedi|ately got under arms and po&s;ted them&s;elves in a wood. The allied troops pu&s;hed forward, twice repul|&s;ed the French, and with the mo&s;t noble per&s;everance reiterated their attacks on the wood, and kept up a terrible and well &s;upplied fire for &s;ix|teen hours without intermi&s;&s;ion, that is from five in the morning to the &s;ame evening at nine. There have been few examples of &s;o ob&s;tinate a combat. But at length finding night approach, the troops hara&s;&s;ed, their
<PB N="170" REF="187">
ammunition &s;pent, and all hopes vain of di&s;lodging a &s;uperior ene|my from an advantageous po&s;t, the Hereditary Prince having had an hor&s;e killed under him, and being him&s;elf wounded, was with regret compelled to retire. Eleven hundred and &s;eventy of the allies were killed and wounded in this bloody action; about 500 were made pri|&s;oners. The lo&s;s of the French was far greater; but they had the field.</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion, the Engli&s;h na|tion regretted the lo&s;s of one of its mo&s;t &s;hining ornaments in the death of Lord Downe, who whil&s;t his grateful &s;overeign was de&s;tining him to higher honours, received a mortal wound in this battle. He was a per&s;on of free and plea&s;ure|able life; but of an excellent un|der&s;tanding, amiable manners, and the mo&s;t intrepid courage. In the beginning of this war he had a con|&s;iderable &s;hare in rou&s;ing a martial &s;pirit among&s;t the young people of rank in England, and having long &s;hewed them by a gallant example how to fight, he at la&s;t by a melan|choly one, &s;hewed them how to die for their country.</P>
<P>As the Briti&s;h troops had been the greate&s;t &s;ufferers in this as well as in mo&s;t other actions of the campaign, great murmurs were rai&s;ed again&s;t the commander of the allied army, as if upon all occa&s;ions, even the mo&s;t trivial, he had wantonly expo&s;ed the lives of the Briti&s;h, in order to pre&s;erve tho&s;e of the German &s;oldi|ery. Some carried this complaint to a ridiculous length. But could it with rea&s;on have been expected, that where 25,000 Engli&s;h had &s;erv|ed for a whole campaign, were en|gaged in five &s;harp encounters (&s;ome of them a &s;ort of pitched battles) in all which they acquired the whole glory, that they &s;hould lo&s;e a &s;maller number than 265 killed and 870 wounded, which is the whole of their lo&s;s in all the encoun|ters of this campaign? It is true, the life of a man is a &s;acred thing, and of value to his country. But in &s;ome circum&s;tances it is ridiculous for a nation to think of &s;paring even a greater effu&s;ion of blood to acquire reputation to their arms, and experi|ence to the troops and the officers. The Engli&s;h de&s;ired the po&s;t of honour with equal &s;pirit and wi&s;|dom, they were entitled to it, they had it, and they purcha&s;ed it more cheaply, than on the whole might have been expected. Neither was their blood lavi&s;hed on every trivial occa&s;ion, as had been fal&s;ely &s;ug|ge&s;ted. The only affairs in which they &s;uffered any thing worth no|tice, were tho&s;e of Warbourg and Campen; both actions of the highe&s;t con&s;equence.</P>
<P>After the di&s;appointment and lo&s;s the Hereditary Prince had &s;uffered in the late engagement, he was &s;en&s;ible that a &s;iege could no longer be carried on with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, in &s;ight of an army &s;o much &s;uperior; the Rhine every day &s;welled more and more, and his communication with the troops be|fore We&s;el became ever hour more difficult. Be&s;ides, as the whole country was by this time overflowed, his men mu&s;t have been expo&s;ed to the greate&s;t hard&s;hips and the mo&s;t fatal di&s;tempers. The&s;e con&s;idera|tions determined him to repa&s;s the Rhine without delay. Notwith|&s;tanding the extreme nearne&s;s of the French army, the late repul&s;e the prince had met, and the great &s;well of the waters, &s;uch was the impre&s;|&s;ion he had le&s;t on the enemy, and the excellence of his di&s;po|&s;itions, that they did not even at|tempt
<PB N="171" REF="188">
to di&s;tre&s;s his rear; and he pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine without the lea&s;t mole&s;tation, not only under the eye, but as it were within the gra&s;p of a &s;uperior French army.</P>
<P>From this the operations of the armies became gradually more lan|guid; for as nothing deci&s;ive hap|pened on either &s;ide during the whole campaign, it was impo&s;&s;ible to think at this advanced &s;ea&s;on of undertaking any very &s;ignal enter|pri&s;e. As if by common con&s;ent they began to move towards winter quarters. So that whatever hap|pened after this was not connected with the general plan of the cam|paign; and were the &s;udden acts of detached parties who attempted &s;ome advantages of &s;urprize. Of the&s;e we &s;hall take &s;ome notice before we conclude, but we pa&s;s them by at pre&s;ent; the attention of all men being at this time more engaged by an event of the greate&s;t importance, and which many were of opinion would make no &s;mall change in the nature of the war, and above all in the general &s;y&s;tem of pacification. This was the death of George II. king of Great Britain.</P>
<P>He died &s;uddenly in his palace at Ken&s;ington in the 77th year of his age and 33d of his reign. The immediate cau&s;e of his death was the rupture of the &s;ub&s;tance of the right ventricle of his heart, by which the circulation was &s;topped in an in&s;tant. This was preceded by no &s;ort of apparent illne&s;s. His ma|je&s;ty enjoyed an uncommon degree of health and &s;trength for that age; but it was believed that he had &s;uffered, by expo&s;ing him&s;elf too much to the cold, in reviewing &s;ome troops that were to be em|barked for the expedition. He had been extremely &s;ollicitous about the fortune of this expedition. He had been no le&s;s anxious for the fate of the enterprize under the Hereditary Prince, an account of the ill &s;ucce&s;s of which he had received, though it was not at that time made public. This was believed to have touched him deeply, and to have been one of the cau&s;es of a death &s;o afflicting to all his people.</P>
<P>When future hi&s;torians come to &s;peak of his late maje&s;ty, they will find both in his fortune and his virtue, abundant matter for ju&s;t and un&s;u&s;pected panegyric. None of his predece&s;&s;ors in the throne of England lived to &s;o great an age; few of them enjoyed &s;o long a reign. And this long cour&s;e was di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by circum&s;tances of peculiar felicity, whether we con&s;ider him in the public or the private character. His &s;ubjects, allowing for one &s;hort and as it were momentary cloud, en|joyed perpetual peace at home, and abroad on many occa&s;ions acquired great glory. There was to the la&s;t a con&s;iderable increa&s;e in their agriculture, their commerce, and their manufactures, which were daily improving under the internal tranquillity they enjoyed, and the wi&s;e regulations that were made in every &s;e&s;&s;ion of his parliaments. By a wonderful happine&s;s, he left the&s;e improvements no way checked, but rather forwarded, in one of the mo&s;t general and wa&s;teful wars that has raged in the world for many cen|turies.</P>
<P>He lived entirely to extingui&s;h party and the &s;pirit of party in his kingdoms; it was not till the clo&s;e of his reign, that his family might have been con&s;idered as firmly and immovably &s;eated on the throne; but he, having baffled all the pri|vate machinations of his enemies
<PB N="172" REF="189">
policy, &s;ubdued at length the utmo&s;t effort of their force: and though on that menacing occa&s;ion, he ex|perienced in the fulle&s;t mea&s;ure the affection of his people, yet the com|pletion of this great &s;ervice to his family, he owed &s;olely to the capa|city and bravery of his own &s;on.</P>
<P>He lived with his queen in that kind of harmony and confidence, that is &s;een between the be&s;t &s;uited couples in private life. He had a numerous i&s;&s;ue, in which he had great cau&s;e of &s;atisfaction, and very little of di&s;quiet, but what was the almo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of a life protracted to a late period. He &s;urvived &s;everal of his children. He had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee in his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or, what is very rare, the mo&s;t affectionate obedience, the mo&s;t du|tiful acquie&s;cence in his will; and what is no le&s;s rare, contrary to the fortune of mo&s;t old kings, he never po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed more perfectly the love of his &s;ubjects than in the la&s;t years of his life. And he died at the very point of time when the terror of his arms, the power of his kingdoms and the wi&s;dom of his government, were all rai&s;ed to almo&s;t as high a pitch as they could po&s;&s;ibly arrive at; they were indeed at that height of pro&s;|perity and glory, as never had been exceeded in the reign of the mo&s;t fortunate of his predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>His parts were not lively or bril|liant; but the whole of his conduct demon&s;trates that he had a judg|ment both &s;olid and comprehen&s;ive. He under&s;tood the intere&s;ts of the other &s;overeigns of Europe; and was particularly &s;killed in all the re|ce&s;&s;es of that political labyrinth, the &s;y&s;tem of Germany; of the liber|ties of which he was through his whole life a mo&s;t zealous a&s;&s;ertor. In the year 1741, he took up arms, and even ri&s;qued his own per&s;on, when by the projected di&s;member|ment of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, they were in danger of falling a &s;acrifice to a French faction. He afterwards re&s;i&s;ted with equal firmne&s;s that very hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, which he had ex|po&s;ed his life to defend, when the li|berties of the empire were threat|ened from that quarter.</P>
<P>The acqui&s;itions of his father, were by him confirmed, improved and enlarged. He was enabled by his oeconomy always to keep up a con&s;iderable body of troops in Ha|nover; by which means, when the war broke out, there was a di&s;ci|plined force ready to oppo&s;e the common enemy; and we do not hazard any thing in a&s;&s;erting, that if it had not been for the prudent fore&s;ight of that mea&s;ure, the army which has &s;ince been formed, and the great things which have &s;ince been done, could never have had exi&s;tence. So that if we only exa|mine what he has done in Germany, when we reflect what enemies &s;e|cret and declared he had at different times to manage and to fight in that country, he mu&s;t in every fair judg|ment be allowed the greate&s;t prince of his family.</P>
<P>He was in his temper &s;udden and violent; but this, though it influ|enced his behaviour, made no im|pre&s;&s;ion on his conduct, which was always &s;ufficiently deliberate and at|tentive to his own intere&s;ts and tho&s;e of his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>He was plain and direct in his in|tentions; true to his word; &s;teady in his favour and protection to his &s;ervants, and never changed them willingly; this appeared clearly in tho&s;e who &s;erved more immediately on his per&s;on, whom he &s;carce ever removed; but they grew old along with him, or died in their places. But having been in a &s;ort compelled
<PB N="173" REF="190">
by a violent faction, to relinqui&s;h a mini&s;ter for whom he had great affec|tion, and in whom he repo&s;ed an un|limited confidence, it afterwards be|came a matter of more indifference to him by whom he was &s;erved in the affairs of his government.</P>
<P>He was merciful in his di&s;po&s;ition, but not to &s;uch a degree as in any &s;ort to encourage offences again&s;t his government. On the &s;uppre&s;|&s;ion of the rebellion in 1746, he be|haved without any remarkable di&s;|play either of &s;everity or clemency. Many were pardoned, many puni&s;h|ed; and this, perhaps, is the mo&s;t proper conduct on &s;uch occa&s;ions, where offended maje&s;ty requires victims, ju&s;tice examples, and hu|manity pardons. But though the law in many in&s;tances had its free cour&s;e, the exce&s;&s;es committed in the rage of war, were by him neither command|ed nor approved. After that rebel|lion had been &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, he retain|ed no bitter remembrance of it, either to the country in which it un|fortunately began, or even to many of the per&s;ons who were actually concerned in it.</P>
<P>As he came into England in a riper age, and of con&s;equence never had been able to attain a perfect knowledge of the force and beauties of our language, he never &s;hewed a &s;ufficient regard to the Engli&s;h li|terature, which in his reign did not flouri&s;h: and this mu&s;t be con&s;ider|ed as the greate&s;t, or rather the only blemi&s;h that lay upon his go|vernment.</P>
<P>He has been cen&s;ured, as a little too attentive to money; and per|haps in &s;ome minute things this cen|&s;ure was not wholly without founda|tion. But there are two con&s;iderations which greatly enervate this objecti|on to his character. Fir&s;t, that this di&s;po&s;ition never &s;hewed it&s;elf in one rapacious act; and 2dly, that it never influenced his conduct on any impor|tant occa&s;ion. For it is now well known that he &s;hewed no improper par&s;imony, when this war broke out. In fact, he expended &s;o much on that occa&s;ion; that on his decea&s;e, his private wealth was found to be far inferior to what had commonly been imagined.</P>
<P>Though it is true, that during his whole life, he had &s;hewn a re|markable affection to his Hanove|rian &s;ubjects, yet the la&s;t act of it demon&s;trated that they were far from engro&s;&s;ing the whole of his re|gard; and that in reality his Ger|man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions held no other place in his con&s;ideration than what their relative importance to the re&s;t of his dominions naturally claimed. For when that truly &s;evere trial came, in which the intere&s;ts of England and Hanover were &s;eparated, when a war began for an object wholly foreign to that country, a war in which Hanover mu&s;t &s;uffer much, and could hope no advantage, even there his maje&s;ty did not he&s;itate a moment to expo&s;e his German dominions to almo&s;t inevitable ruin, rather than make or even propo&s;e the &s;malle&s;t abatement from the immen&s;ity of the Engli&s;h rights in America. A conduct that more than wipes off every &s;u&s;picion of an improper partiality; and which &s;urely ought never to be mentioned without the highe&s;t gratitude to the memory of that magnanimous monarch.</P>
<P>If the authors of the&s;e &s;heets were equal to &s;uch a de&s;ign, it would perhaps be impo&s;&s;ible to exhibit a more plea&s;ing picture than that which might be formed from a ju&s;t view of his late maje&s;ty's conduct, to the&s;e two &s;o differently con&s;tituted parts of his dominions. His virtue was
<PB N="174" REF="191">
proved by two of the greate&s;t trials to which the nature of man is liable; the tru&s;t of ab&s;olute and unbounded power; and the mo&s;t exalted &s;tation limited by the &s;tricte&s;t laws. For the&s;e two &s;o very different &s;itua|tions, very different and almo&s;t oppo&s;ite tempers and talents have been always thought nece&s;&s;ary. But that king had a mind per|fectly adapted to both; for whil&s;t in England he kept the liberties of his people inviolate, and like a wi&s;e magi&s;trate, was &s;atisfied to make his authority co-operate with law, and his will freely &s;ub|&s;ervient to the wi&s;dom of ages, in Hanover like an indulgent father, act|ing only from the &s;entiments of a pa|ternal heart, his affection and his equity &s;upplied the want of law and con&s;titution. He has indeed left to his illu&s;trious &s;ucce&s;&s;or, an admir|able example; which he not only promi&s;es to follow, but in many re&s;pects to exceed; and his &s;ub|jects take the greater intere&s;t in his virtues, as they look upon them as more peculiarly their own; and they now boa&s;t of a prince, who neither has, nor can have any partiality but the be&s;t, and who is in birth as well as inclination Briti&s;h.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty came to the throne and had met his parliament, <NOTE PLACE="marg">18 Nov.</NOTE> he in the mo&s;t public and &s;o|lemn manner confirmed the hopes of his allies, and gave the mo&s;t un|doubted a&s;&s;urances of his re&s;olution to continue the war on the former plan, and with the former vigour; and he found his parliament no ways changed in their re&s;olution of &s;up|porting it with the &s;ame liberality and &s;pirit. In&s;omuch that as there was no apparent change either in the &s;y&s;tem of the alliance, in the di&s;po&s;ition of the king, or in that of the nation, or in the general plan of the war, we have only to pa&s;s again to the tran&s;|actions of the continent, thinking it unnece&s;&s;ary to apologize to our rea|ders for having been diverted from the cour&s;e of the narrative for a &s;hort time, by an event of &s;uch melan|choly importance to Great Britain and to all Europe.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians and Au&s;trians enter Brandenburg. General Hul&s;en retreats from Saxony to Berlin. Evacuates it. The city capitulates. Berlin de&s;cribed King's palaces plundered. Enemy retires out of Brandenburg after having pillaged it.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE King of Pru&s;&s;ia's letter, with which we clo&s;ed the 6th chapter, exhibited a true picture of that monarch's apprehen&s;ions; the events which immediately fol|lowed proved that the&s;e apprehen|&s;ions were but too well grounded. The victory near Lignitz, indeed, gave &s;ome relief to Sile&s;ia; but whil&s;t the enemy had &s;o many and &s;o numerous armies in the field, even &s;hame independent of their in|tere&s;t exacted from them &s;ome &s;troke of con&s;equence.</P>
<P>The late manoeuvres had nece&s;|&s;arily drawn the King of Pru&s;&s;ia in|to the &s;outhern parts of Sile&s;ia, and con&s;equently to a great di&s;tance from Brandenburg, with which country his communication was much interrupted, or rather wholly cut off. The Ru&s;&s;ian army, which after it had repa&s;&s;ed the Oder at Auras, began to move out of Sile&s;ia,
<PB N="175" REF="192">
pu&s;hed forward a powerful detach|ment under Count Czernichew to|wards the March of Brandenburg. A body of 15000 Au&s;trians under the Generals Lacy and Brentano from the army of Count Daun, and the whole united corps of Au&s;trians and Imperiali&s;ts which acted in Saxony, began their march in con|cert with the Ru&s;&s;ians, and propo&s;ed to unite at the gates of Berlin. The&s;e armies amounted to forty thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>General Hul&s;en, who was altoge|ther too weak to oppo&s;e the Imperi|ali&s;ts in Mi&s;nia, fell back upon Ber|lin. General Werner who had lately been &s;ent into Pomerania, re|turned with incredible &s;peed and joined the troops under Hul&s;en; but when they viewed their com|bined &s;trength, they found it con|&s;i&s;ted of no more than 15 or 16000 men, a force far too weak to op|po&s;e to tho&s;e powerful armies that were marching again&s;t them. Whol|ly unable to protect a place of &s;uch immen&s;e extent, and &s;uch imper|fect fortification, they &s;aw that to attempt a defence, would be only to involve the troops in the inevit|able fate that waited the city, with|out being able to add any thing ef|fectual to its &s;ecurity; therefore after having defended it again&s;t the advanced guard of the Ru&s;&s;ians un|der Tottleben, who attacked the gates and bombarded the town, when they found the grand armies advancing; they made their retreat; leaving only three weak battalions in the place, to enable it to make &s;ome &s;ort of capitulation with the enemy.</P>
<P>Berlin is compo&s;ed of five towns, which have &s;tretched to each other and grown into one va&s;t city upon the banks of the river Spree. It has been augmented to this gran|deur, by having long been the re|&s;idence of the electors of Branden|burg and kings of Pau&s;&s;ia, who as they have enlarged their dominions by inheritance, force, or policy, have all contributed &s;omething to the grandeur and magnificence of this their capital. The &s;ituation of the town on &s;o noble and navigable a river as the Spree, communicating on one &s;ide with the Oder, by a canal (the mo&s;t princely work of her &s;overeigns) and on the other falling into the Elbe, has added not a little to its extent and opulence; but that which has contributed mo&s;t of all, has been the reception of the French refugees, to which this city has always been a mo&s;t a&s;&s;ured and favourable a&s;ylum, as it has al&s;o been to tho&s;e prote&s;tants who have been per&s;ecuted in any part of Germany; and the pre&s;ent king by enlarging his plan, and imparting an extent of toleration unknown to his predece&s;|&s;ors, has al&s;o introduced Roman catholics, whom he has encouraged by &s;uffering them to build a mo&s;t magnificent church in the heart of Berlin. By this means he has brought the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite factions to concur in promoting the gran|deur of his royal re&s;idence. From the&s;e cau&s;es Berlin is become one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable cities in Eu|rope; va&s;t in its extent; con&s;ider|able in its commerce; and magni|ficent beyond mo&s;t others in its pub|lic and private buildings, and the regular di&s;tribution of the &s;treets in the new town. It had long been the &s;eat of the greate&s;t military arrange|ments in the world; and it was made by the pre&s;ent king the &s;eat of arts and &s;ciences, and the place of re&s;ort
<PB N="176" REF="193">
of ingenious men, in every &s;cience, in every art, and from every quarter.</P>
<P>Such is Berlin, which at this time being de&s;erted by the greate&s;t part of its garri&s;on, was abandoned to the mercy of a mighty army of Au&s;trians, Ru&s;&s;ians, Saxons and Im|periali&s;ts, animated by revenge; exa&s;perated by injuries; and in&s;ti|gated by avarice. Nothing could exceed the terror and con&s;ternation of the inhabitants on this occa&s;ion. They were acquainted with the &s;a|vage character of one part of the enemy, and with the violent ani|mo&s;ity of the re&s;t; and they knew that they did not want pretences for colouring their &s;everities, with the appearance of a ju&s;t retaliation.</P>
<P>In the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions of the in|habitants, the enemy approached. The garri&s;on immediately propo&s;ed to capitulate. With re&s;pect to them, the terms were &s;hort; they were made pri&s;oners of war. But with regard to the inhabitants, where the great danger lay, the conditions were more tolerable than they ex|pected; they were promi&s;ed the free exerci&s;e of their religion; and an immunity from violence to their goods and per&s;ons. It was al&s;o agreed that the Ru&s;&s;ian irregulars &s;hould not enter the town; and that the king's palace &s;hould be inviola|ble. The&s;e on the whole, were favourable terms; and they were granted principally on the mediation of the foreign mini&s;ters re&s;iding in Berlin, who interpo&s;ed their good offices with great zeal and humanity. The difficulty was, how to &s;ecure the ob&s;ervance of them.</P>
<P>The&s;e conditions being made, the army of the allied <NOTE PLACE="marg">9th Oct.</NOTE> powers entered the town; totally de|&s;troyed the magazines, an&s;enals, and founderies, &s;eized an immen&s;e quan|tity of military &s;tores, and a number of cannon and arms; called fir&s;t for the immediate payment of 800,000 guilders, and then laid on a con|tribution of 1,900,000 German crowns: not &s;atisfied with this, many irregularities were committed by the &s;oldiery; but on the whole, though &s;ome &s;hocking actions were committed, a far more exact di&s;ci|pline was ob&s;erved than from &s;uch troops could have been expected upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion, where there was every incentive which could work upon the licence of a con|quering army. Their officers no doubt with great difficulty pre&s;erved even that degree of order.</P>
<P>But though their behaviour was tolerable, with regard to the private inhabitants, there was &s;omething &s;hocking and ungenerous in their treatment of the king's palaces. The apartments of the royal ca&s;tle of Charlottenburgh were entirely plun|dered, the precious furniture &s;poil|ed, the pictures defaced, without even &s;paring the antique &s;tatues col|lected by Cardinal Polignac, which had been purcha&s;ed by the hou&s;e of Brandenburg. The ca&s;tle of Schon|hou&s;en, belonging to the queen, and that of Fredericksfeld, belong|ing to the margrave Charles, were al&s;o plundered.</P>
<P>The palace of Pot&s;dam, the fa|mous Sans-&s;ouci, had a better fate; Prince E&s;terha&s;i commanded there; it was pre&s;erved from the &s;malle&s;t violation. The prince on viewing the palace only a&s;ked which picture of the king re&s;embled him mo&s;t, and being informed, de&s;ired that he might have leave to take it, toge|ther with two German flutes which the king u&s;ed, to keep them, he

&s;aid, in memory of his maje&s;ty. This was a &s;ort of taking very dif|ferent from pillage.</P>
<P>They &s;taid in the city four days, but hearing that the king, apprehen|&s;ive of this &s;troke, was moving to the relief of his capital, they quit|ted it on the 13th of October; and having wa&s;ted the whole country round for a va&s;t extent, and driven away all the cattle and hor&s;es they could find, retreated by different routs out of Brandenburg, leaving the people &s;till trembling under the alarm, and hardly yet certain of their &s;afety.</P>
<P>We do by no means undertake to authenticate the ravages which the Pru&s;&s;ian accounts charged upon the Au&s;trians and their allies, in this in|cur&s;ion; nor whether they may not have been in general much exag|gerated, or in &s;ome ca&s;es ab&s;olutely feigned. We have abundant rea|&s;on to &s;u&s;pect the exact veracity of many pieces of that nature which have been publi&s;hed on all &s;ides; and which are but too frequently a &s;ort of &s;tate libels, where the powers at war, not content to de|&s;troy each other in the field, pur&s;ue their adver&s;aries reputation, and en|deavour mutually to paint each other as mon&s;ters equally devoid of ju&s;tice and compa&s;&s;ion. Indeed if we were to give credit to all the writings of this kind that have ap|peared, it were hard to &s;ay which of the parties have by their con|duct brought the greate&s;t di&s;grace upon human nature. It is, how|ever, certain, that the country of Brandenburg &s;uffered more &s;everely on this occa&s;ion than the city of Berlin. An ill di&s;ciplined army is al|ways mo&s;t furious in its retreat, and the country had made no condi|tions.</P>

<P>THE King of Pru&s;&s;ia at la&s;t &s;aw his capital taken by his mo&s;t cruel enemies, and put to ran&s;om; his native country was wa&s;ted; they took up their quarters in his palaces: but this was far from the whole of his misfortunes. When Gen. Hul&s;en marched to cover Brandenburg, there remained no Pru&s;&s;ian army in Saxony. So that the Imperial army on their return from Berlin, within a &s;hort time, and with little oppo&s;ition, made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Leip|&s;ick, Torgau, Mei&s;&s;en, and at la&s;t of Wittemberg; in which city they took the grand magazine of the Pru&s;&s;ians immen&s;ely &s;tored. The king was now totally <NOTE PLACE="marg">15 Oct.</NOTE> driven out of Saxony, in which he had no longer a &s;ingle place.</P>
<P>M. Stainville with a detachment of Broglio's army, as &s;oon as Wan|genheim had been obliged to repa&s;s the We&s;er (as we have related in the &s;eventh chapter) pu&s;hed into the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's dominions on that &s;ide, and laid the city and dutchy of Halber&s;tadt under contribution. In the ea&s;tern Pomerania, the Ru&s;&s;ians had inve&s;ted Colberg both by land
<PB N="178" REF="195">
and &s;ea, and pre&s;&s;ed that city with a clo&s;e and unremitted &s;iege. The king could &s;carcely hope to relieve it. In the we&s;tern Pomerania, the Swedes urged forward with uncom|mon vigour, hoping to partake in the plunder of Berlin; and they advanced with &s;ucce&s;s. In Sile&s;ia, the king had no &s;ooner began his march to the northward, than Baron Laudohn profited of his ab&s;ence to ru&s;h again into that country, and to inve&s;t the &s;trong and important for|tre&s;s of Co&s;el. Whil&s;t the king's dominions were thus attacked in &s;o many parts, he was him&s;elf attend|ed every &s;tep of his march by the &s;uperior army of Count Daun, who moved along with him and watch|ed him with the mo&s;t attentive vi|gilance. His condition &s;eemed ex|tremely to re&s;emble that to which he had been reduced in the autumn immediately preceding the battle of Rosbach. In Sile&s;ia, his condition was at that time wor&s;e; but he was then in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Saxony, of which in this campaign he was wholly de|prived.</P>
<P>Saxony was, however, &s;till his great object, and knowing that the enemy had evacuated Brandenburg on his approach, he left that coun|try on his right, and continued his march to the Elbe, which he pa&s;s'd on the 25th of October. M. Daun pa&s;&s;ed it the &s;ame day. The two champions were to engage once more for the &s;o often contended prize; but now every di&s;advantage was on the &s;ide of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, who had no longer any place of &s;trength in that country, and all the magazines he had ama&s;&s;ed were in the hands of the enemy. But being joined by his generals Hul&s;en and P. Eugene of Wirtemberg, with the corps under their command, he advanced up the Elbe, whil&s;t M. Daun fell back to cover Leip&s;ic and Torgau; but finding the Pru&s;&s;ians directed their march towards the Elbe, he encamped within reach of Torgau, one part of his army ex|tending to the Elbe, by which he was covered on that &s;ide, and whil&s;t he was protected on every other quarter by ponds, hills, and woods, it was impo&s;&s;ible to chu&s;e a more advantageous &s;ituation, in which above 80,000 men were po&s;ted with every precaution that could be taken by a weak army in the mo&s;t unlucky po&s;ition.</P>
<P>The King of Pru&s;&s;ia was ex|tremely &s;en&s;ible of the &s;trength, the advantageous po&s;ture, and the pre|cautions of M. Daun; he could have no hope of drawing that wary commander from his po&s;t; and yet he &s;aw a nece&s;&s;ity of fighting him even there. The winter was now far advanced. His troops were ex|tremely hara&s;&s;ed by &s;uch long and rapid marches: and he had no place for their winter-quarters but his own country, already wa&s;ted by the ene|mies incur&s;ions; and here &s;treighten|ed for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, cut off from all power of recruiting, he was to ex|pect to be attacked, as it were, in a narrow corner by the combined force of &s;o many powerful and ex|a&s;perated enemies.</P>
<P>In the&s;e circum&s;tances he was re|&s;olved to come to a battle. He cau&s;ed his army to be informed that he was to lead them to a mo&s;t de&s;|perate attempt, that his affairs re|quired it, and that he was deter|mined to conquer or die in the ex|pected engagement. They unani|mou&s;ly an&s;wered, that they would die along with him.</P>
<P>Animated by this decla|ration he began his march; <NOTE PLACE="marg">3d Nov.</NOTE>
<PB N="179" REF="196">
but having taken a re&s;olution as dar|ing as could be dictated by de&s;pair, he made all the di&s;po&s;itions with as much &s;kill and care as could be &s;ug|ge&s;ted by the mo&s;t guarded pru|dence. He divided his army into three columns; General Hul&s;en with one was to take po&s;t in a wood that lay on the left of the Au&s;trian army, and had orders not to move until he found the re&s;t of the Pru&s;&s;ians en|gaged. General Ziethen was to charge on the right; the great at|tack in front was to be made by the king in per&s;on. The king had di&s;po&s;ed his force in &s;uch a man|ner, that either his right or left mu&s;t take the enemy in rear and clo&s;e them in, &s;o as to di&s;able them from undertaking any thing again&s;t the part where he intended to effect his principal attack. This was the king's di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>M. Daun as &s;oon as he perceived that the King of Pru&s;&s;ia was &s;erious in his re&s;olution of fighting, to pre|vent confu&s;ion, &s;ent all his baggage over the Elbe, acro&s;s which he threw three bridges to be ready in ca&s;e a re|treat &s;hould be found nece&s;&s;ary. At the &s;ame time he cau&s;ed Torgau to be evacuated. And then extending his fir&s;t line to a village called Zinne on the left, he &s;tretched it to another called Gro&s;witz on the right; &s;up|porting the right of his &s;econd line, upon the Elbe.</P>
<P>In this di&s;po&s;ition he was found when about two o'clock in the afternoon, the King began his attack, and was received with the fire of two hundred pieces of cannon, which were di&s;po&s;ed along the Au&s;trian front. Three times the Pru&s;&s;ians were led on; they per&s;evered in their attacks with uncommon re&s;olution, but were every time repul&s;ed and broken with a mo&s;t terrible &s;laughter. The king at length ordered a fre&s;h body of his cavalry to advance, which at fir&s;t compelled the Au&s;trians to give way; but as fre&s;h reinforce|ments were continually poured on that part, this cavalry was in its turn obliged to fall back, and the battle &s;till remained at lea&s;t du|bious, or rather inclined again&s;t the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, who&s;e troops, as they had made a&s;toni&s;hing efforts, &s;o they &s;uffered beyond all de&s;crip|tion. But whil&s;t the Pru&s;&s;ians &s;u&s;tain|ed them&s;elves in that quarter with &s;uch extreme difficulty, General Zie|then, with the right wing took the enemy in the rear, repul&s;ed them and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of &s;ome emi|nences which commanded the whole Au&s;trian army. Encouraged by this &s;ucce&s;s the Pru&s;&s;ian infantry once more advanced, ma&s;tered &s;everal of the enemy's intrenchments, and made way for a new attack of their cavalry, which broke in with irre&s;i&s;|tible impetuo&s;ity upon the Au&s;trians, and threw &s;everal bodies of them in|to irreparable di&s;order. It was now about nine o'clock, the two armies were involved in a pitchy dark|ne&s;s; yet the fire continued with|out intermi&s;&s;ion, and the battalions with a blind rage di&s;charged at each other without di&s;tingui&s;hing friend or foe.</P>
<P>M. Daun did every thing in the di&s;po&s;ition and the action, that be|came his high character. But he was obliged to yield to the mi|raculous fortune of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. He received a dangerous wound on the thigh, and was car|ried from the field, which probably di&s;heartened the troops, and ha&s;|tened the defeat. The command then fell on the Count O'Donnel, who finding a great part of his
<PB N="180" REF="197">
troops in di&s;order, the night ad|vanced, and the enemy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of eminences which commanded his camp, and of which it was vain to think of di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them, order|ed a retreat, which was conducted in this darkne&s;s and acro&s;s the Elbe with wonderful order; none were lo&s;t in pa&s;&s;ing the bridges, and far the greater part of their artillery was pre&s;erved. The Pru&s;&s;ians re|mained ma&s;ters of this well-fought and bloody field. The darkne&s;s hindered them from mole&s;ting the enemies retreat or improving their victory, which they bought at the expence of ten thou&s;and killed and wounded, and about three thou&s;and pri&s;oners. But even with this lo&s;s, the advantage was well purcha&s;ed: it was a nece&s;&s;ary and a glorious victory. It re-e&s;tabli&s;hed the re|putation of their arms; it &s;ecured their winter-quarters; and gave them again the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a great part of Saxony.</P>
<P>Probably of all the King of Pru&s;|&s;ia's battles, this was the mo&s;t im|portant; and it was that in the con|duct of which he &s;hewed the great|e&s;t &s;kill, intrepidity, and per&s;eve|rance. His troops behaved with a firmne&s;s which would have done honour to tho&s;e which he formerly led into Bohemia. In this action where they were to &s;urmount every ob&s;tacle and encounter every diffi|culty and danger in order to attack &s;o great and excellent an army as the Au&s;trian, under &s;uch an ac|compli&s;hed commander as M. Daun, their number did not exceed fifty thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of the Au&s;trians was very great; the number killed and wounded is not indeed accurately known. Probably it did not much, if at all exceed the lo&s;s on the &s;ide of the victorious army; but the pri&s;oners were far more numerous, two hundred and &s;ixteeen officers of the Au&s;trians were taken, among whom were four generals, together with eight thou&s;and of the common &s;ort. The king in this battle, in which he every moment expo&s;ed his life to the greate&s;t dangers, received a &s;light contu&s;ion in his brea&s;t by a mu&s;ket &s;hot.</P>
<P>The Au&s;trians di&s;puted the victo|ry in the Gazettes. But the King of Pru&s;&s;ia reaped all the fruits of it; he recovered all Saxony except Drefden; it had been the ex|tremity of ra&s;hne&s;s to have com|menced the &s;iege of that place in the depth of winter, and in the &s;ight of an army &s;trongly po&s;ted, and which though it had been beaten continued after its defeat, more nu|merous than his own. His troops had already &s;u&s;tained fatigues almo&s;t be|yond human &s;trength; and the mo&s;t prudent part now left was to per|mit them to enjoy a little repo&s;e; and in the interval of action to prepare, by employing the means his victory had put into his hands, for the arduous work of the en&s;uing campaign.</P>
<P>Indeed the face of the Pru&s;&s;ian af|fairs had been prodigiou&s;ly changed &s;ince the day in which their enemies had entered Berlin. It was ob&s;erved that the taking of that city had been before this ominous to the Au&s;trian cau&s;e: and that General Haddick's expedition again&s;t it in 1757, had been followed by the victories of Ro&s;bach and Li&s;&s;a, as this irruption was by that of Tor|gau. There was &s;ome difference between the former victories and the latter. But the Pru&s;&s;ians drew motives of con&s;olation and hope from the&s;e coincidences. There was al&s;o &s;omething &s;olid in the ad|vantages
<PB N="181" REF="198">
they had acquired. After the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's march had delivered Berlin, General Werner marched into Pomerania; and on his approach, together with that of Win|ter, the Ru&s;&s;ians rai&s;ed the &s;iege of Colberg, (which they had kept &s;o long blocked up by &s;ea and land) and then retired into Poland, not having been able to effect in Pomerania by the operations of the whole year, more than the deva&s;tation of the open country. Then Werner having freed the Ea&s;tern, flew to the relief of the We&s;tern Pomerania, where the &s;uc|ce&s;s was as rapid, and more brilliant. He defeated a body of Swedes which was po&s;ted near Pa&s;&s;ewalk, compel|led them to retire with the lo&s;s of a thou&s;and men, in killed and pri|&s;oners; and pur&s;uing his advantage with &s;pirit, the Swedes were at length compelled to evacuate the Pru&s;&s;ian Pomerania, and to fall back upon Stral&s;und.</P>
<P>All the armies of the Ru&s;&s;ians at length quitted the king's territories. General Laudohn abruptly rai&s;ed the blockade of Co&s;el; and afterwards abandoning Land&s;hut, he retired in|to the Au&s;trian Sile&s;ia, and left all the Pru&s;&s;ian part in quiet. M. Daun after the battle of Torgau, &s;eeing the King of Pru&s;&s;ia at|tempt nothing again&s;t Dre&s;den, placed one part of his army in that city, and cantoned the re&s;t in tho&s;e &s;trong po&s;ts which lie to the &s;outh and we&s;t of it, by which he com|manded the Elbe and kept open his communication with Bohemia. The army of the empire retired into Fran|conia, and placed its head quarters at Bamberg.</P>
<P>The King of Pru&s;&s;ia omitted nothing to re-e&s;tabli&s;h his affairs; and the recovery of Saxony gave him great opportunities for that purpo&s;e. We may judge of the importance of that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by the re&s;ources he was able to draw from it. He demanded of the circle of Leip&s;ick for the contributions of the en&s;uing year, two millions of crowns, exclu&s;ive of the ordinary revenue, together with a va&s;t quantity of forage and provi&s;ion. From all the other parts of Mi&s;|nia which he held he exacted in the &s;ame proportion. He compel|led them al&s;o to &s;upply a va&s;t num|ber of recruits: his demand was twenty thou&s;and; and though it be certain that they could not &s;upply &s;o many, yet he was enabled by the re|cruits furni&s;hed by Saxony alone, entirely to fill up the breaches which the battle of Torgau had made in his battalions. He drew al&s;o va&s;t re&s;ources from the duchy of Meck|lenburgh, which he taxed at &s;ome millions of crowns, an immen&s;e quantity of provi&s;ion, and a great number of recruits. The&s;e he in|&s;i&s;ted either on receiving immediately, or that the duke &s;hould enter his troops into the Pru&s;&s;ian &s;ervice. It is &s;aid that his maje&s;ty then made &s;ome &s;ort of treaty or compo&s;ition with the duke, who&s;e condition has been from the beginning of the war, the wor&s;t that can be imagined. For his &s;ituation is &s;uch, ju&s;t behind the Pru&s;&s;ian dominions, and out of all po&s;&s;ibility of communication with the grand armies of his allies, that he cannot be benefited by any advantages which they ac|quire; on the contrary, he &s;uffers almo&s;t equally, whether the King of Pru&s;&s;ia be victorious or defeated; and his dominions mu&s;t furni&s;h the means of improving the king's victories, and repairing his lo&s;&s;es. If the King of Pru&s;&s;ia has made a treaty with this prince, there is no doubt
<PB N="182" REF="199">
that it is almo&s;t wholly in his maje&s;ty's favour, and that he has taken care that he &s;hall not draw much le&s;s pro|fit from the Duke of Mecklenburg as an ally, than he had derived from him as an enemy.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, with regard to ex|tent of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the King of Pru&s;|&s;ia is much in the &s;ame &s;ituation in which he was left at the clo&s;ing the foregoing campaign; but in all other re&s;pects his condition is infinitely pre|ferable. He had then indeed the &s;ame po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Saxony; but he clo&s;ed that campaign with the lo&s;s of two battles, de&s;tructive in them|&s;elves, and di&s;graceful in their cir|cum&s;tances: he clo&s;ed this by a mo&s;t beneficial and mo&s;t glorious victory, by which the reputation of his arms, greatly tarni&s;hed, was re&s;tored to its former brightne&s;s, and which in its con&s;equences has given him as fair a pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s as he can have, whil&s;t the alliance again&s;t him is not in the lea&s;t degree weakened by the falling off of the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable member, or the abatement of the &s;malle&s;t degree of their animo&s;ity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. <HI>The Allies rai&s;e the &s;iege of Gottingen. Winter quarters and &s;ufferings of the Briti&s;h troops. Popular debates in England concerning the German war.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE allied army in We&s;tpha|lia after their failure on the lower Rhine, turned their attention to the ea&s;tward of the We&s;er, and made a vigorous attempt upon Got|tingen, which from the 22d of No|vember, until the 12th of the fol|lowing month, they kept blockaded. But the French made a brave de|fence, and having taken a &s;trong po&s;t of the allies in a fally, they compelled them to rai&s;e the block|ade. They were before heartily weary of it, having &s;uffered incre|dible hard&s;hips, both in this and all the other &s;ervices of the cam|paign, in which they had &s;o often traver&s;ed that great tract of coun|try which lies between the Maine, the We&s;er, and the Rhine: and though the winter continued very temperate and open, &s;uch unu&s;ual rains had fallen, that the waters were every where out, and the roads &s;o damag|ed, that their provi&s;ions could &s;carce|ly arrive, or their communication be pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>At length therefore, they &s;ub|mitted to go into winter quarters, leaving the French in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of He&s;&s;e, and the whole country ea&s;t|ward of the We&s;er to the frontiers of the electorate: by which they communicated with the Au&s;trians and Imperiali&s;ts, and prevented the &s;uccours with which the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, after the battle of Torgau, had intended to reinforce the al|lied army. The Engli&s;h troops were cantoned for the winter, in the bi&s;hopric of Paderborn; and Lord Granby e&s;tabli&s;hed his head|quarters in the city of that name. But the&s;e quarters proved a very in|different place of repo&s;e for the Briti&s;h troops, worn out with the fatigues of &s;o labourious a campaign, partly from the natural penury of the country; and partly from the va&s;t numbers to be &s;upported, at a time when the &s;phere of their &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence was extremely &s;treightened; and even that narrow &s;phere ex|hau&s;ted by having been four years
<PB N="183" REF="200">
the &s;eat of war. This &s;carcity was increa&s;ed by the difficulty of the roads, and probably in &s;ome de|gree by the avarice of contractors, over whom, &s;everal were of opini|on, as &s;trict a watch had not been kept, as is at all times nece&s;&s;ary for that &s;ort of people.</P>
<P>But whatever were the cau&s;es of this &s;carcity; it was bitterly felt by the troops, and was accompanied by di&s;ea&s;es which thinned them ex|tremely. This rai&s;ed a general di&s;|content in the army, which was &s;peedily communicated to England, where the people during the pre|ceding year, not having been &s;truck with tho&s;e brilliant advantages which di&s;tingui&s;h an offen&s;ive cam|paign, did not confine their com|plaints to the conduct of the war, but began to fall into an almo&s;t ge|neral di&s;like of the very &s;y&s;tem upon which it was pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>Much of the old di&s;pute between the naval and continental &s;chemes was renewed; and enforced with many additional topics. The al|liances of the war in Germany were &s;everely critici&s;ed. "We are pur|&s;uing, &s;aid they, a &s;y&s;tem, by which we mu&s;t certainly lo&s;e all the ad|vantages which we acquired for the &s;hort time we followed one that was more national, and &s;uitable to our circum&s;tances; a &s;y&s;tem of all others the mo&s;t ab&s;urd; a &s;y&s;tem in which defeats are attended with their u&s;ual fatal effects, and in which even victory it&s;elf cannot &s;ave us from ruin. We will not enter, &s;aid they, into that long and vainly agitated que&s;tion, Whether we ought to take any part in the differences which may ari&s;e between the powers on the continent? This di&s;qui&s;ition is foreign to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e; and it is be&s;ides of too vague and general a nature to admit any pre|ci&s;e determination; but this un|doubtedly may be a&s;&s;erted, that we can never, con&s;i&s;tently with com|mon prudence, engage in a conti|nental war again&s;t France, without a concurrence in our favour of the other powers on the continent. This was the continental &s;cheme of the great King William; and this principle the foundation of the grand alliance which he projected, and at the head of which, in de|fence of the liberties of Europe, he made the mo&s;t augu&s;t appearance to which human nature can be rai&s;|ed. It was on this principle, that in conjunction with half Europe, we carried on the war with &s;o much honour and &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t France, under the Duke of Marlbo|rough. But to engage in a conti|nental war with that power, not only una&s;&s;i&s;ted but oppo&s;ed by the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e &s;tates with whom we were then combined, is an attempt never to be ju&s;tified by any comparative calculation of the populou&s;ne&s;s, the revenues, or the general &s;trength of the two nations. It is a de&s;perate &s;truggle, which mu&s;t finally end in our ruin.</P>
<P>But what is the &s;cene which we have cho&s;en for this &s;truggle? We have cho&s;en Germany; the very &s;pot of all others which the French, if they had their choice, would have pointed out to us. By mak|ing Germany the theatre of war, they &s;ee that country wa&s;ted and de&s;troyed, the &s;trength of which has always proved the greate&s;t bul|wark again&s;t their overbearing am|bition. They &s;ee the &s;words of the Germans, from one end to the other of that va&s;t and populous country, turned again&s;t each other; and they &s;ee with joy the Engli&s;h, who&s;e in|tere&s;t
<PB N="184" REF="201">
it is to &s;ave them as much as po&s;&s;ible, co-operating with her blood and her trea&s;ures, to com|pleat the di&s;union, and con&s;equent|ly the de&s;olation of Germany. In a war in that country France has many advantages: &s;he &s;upports her armies in a great degree by pillag|ing tho&s;e whom in every re&s;pect it is her intere&s;t to weaken. She is not very remote from her own frontiers, from whence &s;he is ea&s;ily provided, ea&s;ily recruited; and by means of which a great part of the public money is expended in the country where it is rai&s;ed. Is &s;he un&s;ucce&s;sful? &s;he is brought thereby but the nearer to her fron|tier, &s;upports her troops with &s;till the greater facility, and exhau&s;ts &s;till le&s;s the natural wealth of her people. Even &s;uppo&s;e the French army dri|ven into France; even then the&s;e advantages on her &s;ide are increa&s;ed; and very obvious circum&s;tances ren|der it impo&s;&s;ible for the allied ar|my to pu&s;h their &s;ucce&s;s on the Ger|man frontiers of France to any de|ci&s;ive con&s;equence.</P>
<P>But to the Engli&s;h, every thing is unfavourable in &s;uch a war; their greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;es will only carry them to greater di&s;tance from their re&s;ources, and every &s;tep of their pro|gre&s;s mu&s;t make the tran&s;port of pro|vi&s;ion, artillery, ammunition, and the infinite impediments of a large army more difficult, and in the end altogether impracticable. This is not &s;peculation; the events which followed the battle of Cre|velt have proved it. Prince Fer|dinand, victorious in that action, was obliged, rather from the diffi|culty of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, than the &s;uperi|ority of the enemy, to repa&s;s the Rhine, and to bring back to Ger|many that war with which he threatned France. It is thus, that upon this plan, victory it&s;elf cannot &s;ave us, and that all our &s;ucce&s;&s;es &s;erve only to accumulate new di&s;|tre&s;&s;es, new difficulties, new charges. Whil&s;t France, who has only con|tracted her expences by the lo&s;s of her navy, encourages us to enter deeper and deeper into the inextri|cable toils of a German war, in which we wa&s;te our &s;trength only to entangle our&s;elves further. She holds the &s;trings, and can never be tired out at this game. From all this ari&s;es an expence unknown even in thought to our forefathers, and which the &s;ingle revenue of Eng|land is by no means able to bear. The allies, if they de&s;erve the name, &s;upply not the &s;malle&s;t part of it. The Hanoverians and He&s;&s;ians con|tribute to our &s;ervice only by en|abling us to protract &s;till longer our efforts in a &s;y&s;tem, in which nothing can &s;o effectually &s;erve us as being defeated as early as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>As to the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, what we pay to that monarch, may ra|ther be con&s;idered as tribute than &s;ub&s;idy; &s;ince we receive nothing in return: and that far from being able to afford any relief to our ar|mies, he is &s;carcely in a condition to &s;upport him&s;elf. So that this al|liance is wor&s;e than the former, as it is an heavy charge compen&s;ated not only with no real, but even with no apparent or &s;hewy advan|tage. Indeed, he is an ally the la&s;t in the world we ought to have cho&s;en, on account of his long con|nection with our wor&s;t enemies, the mean and the ho&s;tile &s;entiments he has always entertained towards us, the injuries he has done us, and the general lightne&s;s of his faith with re|gard to his former allies. We re|gard him, it is true, as the protec|tor of the prote&s;tant religion; but how lightly he thinks of all religi|on
<PB N="185" REF="202">
his writings te&s;tify; and what mi&s;chiefs he has done the prote&s;|tant cau&s;e in particular, this war will be a la&s;ting memorial. When he entered Saxony, a prote&s;tant country, he found that religion no ways mole&s;ted in tho&s;e places, where it had been e&s;tabli&s;hed or tolerated by the treaty of We&s;t|phlia. Even in the popi&s;h do|mmions the per&s;ecution began to lo&s;e &s;omething of its edge, when he under the name of its protector, brought upon it as great a calamity as its mo&s;t determined enemies could have wi&s;hed; by dividing the re|formed &s;tates of the empire, and &s;etting prote&s;tants to cut the throats of prote&s;tants, whil&s;t all the popi&s;h powers have been forced into a &s;trict confederacy.</P>
<P>Had we kept our&s;elves clear of this ruinous &s;y&s;tem; and in&s;tead of engaging France on her &s;trong &s;ide, attacked and vanqui&s;hed her colonies, one after another, we might without exhau&s;ting our own &s;trength have gradually wa&s;ted away the principal re&s;ources of her trade, and whil&s;t we continued this me|thod, have as little rea&s;on to grow tired of a war (the whole funds of which would be &s;pent at home) as France has to grow weary in the pre|&s;ent manner of carrying it on. If the powers on the continent were left without our interpo&s;ition to do their own bu&s;ine&s;s, they would pro|bably better under&s;tand and better defend their own rights. At wor&s;t let France enter, let them conquer, let them po&s;&s;e&s;s Hanover; there is no mi&s;chief they can do that country greater than it &s;uffers by the pre&s;ent war; and we not exhau&s;ting our|&s;elves by a fruitle&s;s defence, &s;hould in the end by the entire po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the French colonies, be able, be&s;ides the &s;ecurity of our own ju&s;t claims, to re&s;tore the Hanoverian dominions to their lawful &s;overeign, and even to procure &s;ome indemni|fication for what they might have &s;uffered in our quarrel."</P>
<P>This is pretty nearly the &s;ub|&s;tance of what was urged again&s;t the German &s;y&s;tem; and the argument was conducted with great ma|nagement and addre&s;s, and inter|&s;per&s;ed with a number of topics well calculated to &s;pread di&s;content, and to place in an odious light every &s;tep taken in tho&s;e alliances and in that war. Many, however, &s;trongly adhered to that method, and they an&s;wered "That the be&s;t rea&s;ons on the other &s;ide were more &s;pecious than &s;olid; and that the chief writings again&s;t our German connections were declamations ra|ther than arguments. That the complaint of the expence of this war was in &s;ome mea&s;ure ju&s;t; but if the advantage was in any degree equivalent, the expence was incur|red to good purpo&s;e. That France by engaging &s;o heartily as &s;he has done in the German war, has drawn away &s;o much of her attention and her revenue from her navy, that it enabled us to give &s;uch a blow to her maritime &s;trength, as po&s;&s;ibly &s;he may never be able to recover. Her engagement in the German war, has likewi&s;e drawn her from the defence of her colonies, by which means we have conquered &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. It has withdrawn her from the protection of her trade, by which it is entirely de&s;troyed, whil&s;t that of England has never in the profounde&s;t peace been in &s;o flouri&s;h|ing a condition. So that by em|barking in this German war, France has &s;uffered her&s;elf to be
<PB N="186" REF="203">
undone, &s;o far as regards her par|ticular and immediate quarrel with England. But has &s;he had in Ger|many &s;uch &s;ucce&s;&s;es as will counter|ballance this lo&s;s? Far from it. At this moment &s;he is infinitely le&s;s ad|vanced than &s;he was the year &s;he en|tered Germany, after having &s;pent &s;uch immen&s;e &s;ums of money, and lo&s;t by the &s;word, by di&s;ea&s;e, and by de&s;ertion, at lea&s;t 100,000 of her people.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the account &s;tands thus with regard to England; deeply embarked as &s;he has been in this German war, in her particular quarrel with France, &s;he has been carried along with an almo&s;t unin|terrupted tide of &s;ucce&s;s. She has taken many of the French colonies; &s;he has de&s;troyed their navy and their trade, and having in&s;ulted the enemies coa&s;ts, has ruined an har|bour which might one day prove very obnoxious to us. Then how &s;tands the account in Germany? The French have been there frequently defeated; Hanover has been recover|ed and protected; the K. of Pru&s;&s;ia has been pre&s;erved &s;o long at lea&s;t from the rage of his enemies, and in general the liberty of Germany has been hitherto &s;ecured. So that if we have incurred a great expence, we have done by it infinitely more than France has done at an ex|pence much greater than ours. For the advocates who declaim again&s;t the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, &s;eem to have forgot that the charge of the French army mu&s;t exceed ours, as the num|ber of their troops to be paid, ex|ceeds the difference between French and Engli&s;h pay. Tho&s;e on the Engli&s;h e&s;tabli&s;hment in Germany, have at no time exceeded 25000 and the re&s;t of the confederates &s;erve very nearly on the &s;ame terms with the French. Not to mention the &s;ub&s;idies &s;o greatly &s;uperior to ours, which that power pays to &s;tates from whom &s;he has not a &s;ingle regiment to augment her armies. Thus although by our victories France is relieved from the charge of her navy, and that of the defence of &s;ome of her mo&s;t con&s;iderable colonies, the German war alone has brought her finances to a di&s;tre&s;s of which the whole world has been witne&s;s. And nothing le&s;s could have happened; the expence how|ever contracted was &s;till enormous; and the re&s;ource of every war, trade, was almo&s;t wholly de&s;troyed. In England, the expence was al&s;o undoubtedly great: but then, the old trade &s;till remained to &s;upply it, and new channels were opened. Had we lain by and tamely beheld Germany in part po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and the re&s;t compelled to receive laws from France, the war there would &s;oon have been brought to an end; and France, &s;trengthened by victory, by conque&s;t and alliance, would have the whole force and whole revenue of her mighty monarchy free to act again&s;t us alone.</P>
<P>They argued further, that com|mon faith obliged us to an adhe|rence to our engagements both with Hanover nnd Pru&s;&s;ia; and that the pleaded incapacity to a&s;&s;i&s;t them ari&s;ing from the greatne&s;s of the charge could not excu&s;e us; be|cau&s;e the incapacity was not real; and if the expence were inconveni|ent, we ought to have looked to that when we contracted our en|gagements. That it was not true, that we received no advantage from our alliance with the King of Pru&s;&s;ia; for if it be once admitted, that we entered with any rea&s;on in|to the German war (which they &s;up|po&s;ed
<PB N="187" REF="204">
proved) then the King of Pru&s;&s;ia has been very materially &s;er|viceable to us; becau&s;e it was his victory at Rosbach, and the rein|forcement from his troops, which has enabled us to do all that has &s;ince been atchieved. In the like man|ner, if the &s;upport of the prote&s;tant religion be any part of our care, that religion mu&s;t &s;uffer eminently by the ruin of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia; for though the writings attributed to his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty be &s;uch, as if really his, reflect on account of their impiety great di&s;grace on his character as a man, yet as a king, in his public and political capacity, he is the natural protector of the prote&s;tant religion in Germany; and it will always be his intere&s;t to defend it."</P>
<P>We &s;hall not pre&s;ume to deter|mine, which party has the right &s;ide of this que&s;tion; it was once undoubtedly a que&s;tion very fit to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed with great care; but having cho&s;en our party, it is at pre&s;ent little more than a matter of political &s;peculation.</P>

<P>BEfore we re&s;ume the account of the war in America, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to take &s;ome notice of the attempt of the celebrated Thurot. It happened much earlier in the year, than the events which we have ju&s;t related. But to avoid breaking the thread of the more important events in Germany, we have re&s;erved it for this place.</P>
<P>The reader will remember, that in the French &s;cheme for invading the&s;e i&s;lands, (which was de&s;cribed as it then appeared to us in the 4th chapter of the annals of 1759.) a &s;mall &s;quadron was prepared at Dunkirk, under Mon&s;ieur Thurot, the de&s;tination of which mo&s;t people at that time imagined to have been for Scotland. But, it has &s;ince ap|peared, that this little &s;quadron was intended to make a diver&s;ion on the north coa&s;t of Ireland, whil&s;t the grand fleet under Mon&s;ieur de Con|flans, made the principal de&s;cent in &s;ome of the &s;outhern parts of that kingdom. The manner in which the latter and principal part of this project failed, has already been re|lated among the tran&s;actions of that year. It remains now to give &s;ome account of the part in which Thurot was concerned.</P>
<P>His &s;quadron, con&s;i&s;ting of five frigates, on board of which were 1270 land &s;oldiers, &s;ailed from the port of Dunkirk on the 5th of Oc|tober 1759. They had been blocked up until that time by an Engli&s;h fleet; but under favour of an hazy night, they put out to &s;ea, and ar|rived at Gottenburg in Sweden ten days after. From thence they made to Bergen in Norway. In the&s;e voyages, the men were reduced by &s;ickne&s;s, and the ve&s;&s;els them&s;elves
<PB N="188" REF="205">
had &s;o &s;uffered by &s;torms, that they were obliged to &s;end one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of them back to France. It was not until the 5th of Decem|ber, that they were able to &s;ail di|rectly for their place of de&s;tination. But their old ill fortune pur&s;ued them with fre&s;h di&s;appointments. For near three months they beat backward and forward among&s;t the we&s;tern i&s;les of Scotland, having in vain attempted a convenient land|ing near Derry. In this tedious in|terval they &s;uffered every po&s;&s;ible hard&s;hip. Their men were thinned and di&s;heartened. Another of their &s;hips was &s;eparated from them, of which they never heard more. The now remaining three were extreme|ly &s;hattered, and their crews &s;uf|fered extremely by famine. This obliged them to put into the i&s;le of Ilay; where they re|fitted <NOTE PLACE="marg">16 Feb.</NOTE> and took in &s;ome cattle and provi&s;ions, which were liberally paid for by the generous adventurer who commanded, and who behaved in all re&s;pects with his u&s;ual courte&s;y and humanity.</P>
<P>Here they heard for the fir&s;t time of the defeat of Conflans's &s;quadron. This was a circum&s;tance of great di&s;couragement. But as Thurot could not be &s;ure that this intelli|gence was not given to deceive him; he per&s;i&s;ted in his re&s;olution to &s;ail for Ireland. Indeed he had &s;carce|ly any other choice; for he was &s;o poorly victualled, that he could not hope without &s;ome refre&s;hment, to get back to France. And he was further urged on by his love of glory, no &s;mall &s;hare of which he was cer|tain to add to his character, if he could &s;trike a blow of never &s;o little importance on the coa&s;t of Ireland; For by this he might make &s;ome ap|pearance of having revenged the many in&s;ults which had been offered to the coa&s;t of France.</P>
<P>Full of the&s;e ideas, he arrived be|fore the town of Carrickfergus on the 28th of February; and landed his troops, now reduced to about 600 men, the day following. They were augmented by draughts from his &s;eamen to near a thou&s;and. The&s;e he formed on the beach, and moved to the attack of the town. Carrickfergus is &s;urrounded by an old wall ruinous in many places. Colonel Jennings commanded a|bout four companies in the town, mo&s;tly of new rai&s;ed men, extreme|ly ill provided with ammunition, and no way prepared for this at|tack, which they had not the &s;mall|e&s;t rea&s;on to expect. However, they &s;hut the gates, &s;ent off the French pri&s;oners to Belfa&s;t, and took all the mea&s;ures their circum&s;tances would admit. The enemy advanc|ed and attacked the gates. There was no cannon; but the gates were defended with effect by mu&s;quet &s;hot, until the ammunition was &s;pent. Then the garri&s;on retired into the ca&s;tle, which having a breach in the wall near 50 feet in extent, was no ways tenable. They there|fore &s;urrendered pri&s;oners of war with terms of &s;afety for the town.</P>
<P>Thurot as &s;oon as he was ma&s;ter of Carrickfergus, i&s;&s;ued orders to Bel|fa&s;t to &s;end him a quantity of wine and provi&s;ion; he made the &s;ame demand to the magi&s;trates of Car|rickfergus, which they having im|prudently refu&s;ed to comply with, the town was plundered. Thurot having victualled, and gained as much reputation by this action as could be expected from a fleet which was no more than a &s;ort of wreck of the grand enterpri&s;e, &s;et &s;ail for France. But he had not left
<PB N="189" REF="206">
the bay of Carrickfergus many hours, when near the coa&s;t of the I&s;le of Man, he perceived three &s;ail that bore down upon him. The&s;e were three Engli&s;h frigates which happened to be in the harbour of Kin&s;ale, when Thurot made his de&s;cent; the duke of Bedford, lord lieutenant, di&s;patch|ed orders to the commander of the frigates to go in que&s;t of the French armament. The Engli&s;h frigates were one of 36 guns commanded by Capt. Elliot; and two of thirty-two.</P>
<P>Such was their diligence and &s;uc|ce&s;s, that they overtook Thurot's &s;quadron before they could get out of the Iri&s;h &s;ea. They were ex|actly three frigates to three. The French &s;hips were much the larger, and their men much more numer|ous; but both &s;hips and men were in a bad condition. A &s;harp and clo&s;e engagement began. None of the French could po&s;&s;ibly e&s;cape, and they mu&s;t take or be taken. Thurot did all that could be expected from the intrepidity of his character; he fought his &s;hip until &s;he had her hold almo&s;t filled with water, and her decks covered with dead bodies. At length he was killed. The crew of his &s;hip, and by her example tho&s;e of the other two, di&s;pirited by this blow, and pre&s;&s;ed with un|common alacrity by the &s;ignal bra|very of Captain Elliot, and tho&s;e who commanded under him, &s;truck, and were carried into Ram|&s;ay Bay in the I&s;le of Man. Even this incon&s;iderable action ad|ded to the glory of the Engli&s;h arms. None had been better con|ducted, or fought with greater re&s;o|lution. This &s;ole in&s;ult on our coa&s;ts was &s;everely puni&s;hed; and not a ve&s;&s;el concerned in it e&s;caped. The public indeed lamented the death of the brave Thurot, who even whil&s;t he commanded a pri|vateer, fought le&s;s for plunder than honour; who&s;e behaviour was on all occa&s;ions full of humanity and genero&s;ity; and who&s;e undaunted courage rai&s;ed him to rank, and merited di&s;tinction. His death &s;ecured the glory he always &s;ought: he did not live to be brought a pri|&s;onet into England; or to hear in France tho&s;e malignant critici&s;ms, which &s;o often attend unfortunate bravery. This was the fate of the la&s;t remaining branch of that grand armament, which had &s;o long been the hope of France, the alarm of England, and the object of general attention to all Europe.</P>
<P>In America, the French had no great rea&s;on to boa&s;t of their &s;uc|ce&s;s. The action of Sillery only gained them, by an immen&s;e effu&s;ion of their blood, a victory which was attended with no advantageous con&s;equences. Vaudreuil the go|vernor of Canada, after Levy had been compelled to rai&s;e the &s;iege of Quebec, fixed his head-quarters at Montreal, to make if po&s;&s;ible a la&s;t &s;tand in that place; for which purpo&s;e he carried in all his po&s;ts; and here he collected the whole re|gular force that remained in Canada. At the &s;ame time he &s;ought to keep up the &s;pirits of the people by va|rious rumours and devices, by which he practi&s;ed on their credu|lity; one of the&s;e artifices is curi|ous enough; the reader will find it among the &s;tate papers. But Mon&s;ieur Vaudreuil's greate&s;t hope, was not in his artifices, nor his force, but in the &s;ituation of Ca|nada, which is much harder to be entered, than when the enemy has entered it, to be conquered. On the &s;ide where the mo&s;t con&s;iderable part of the Briti&s;h force was to act
<PB N="190" REF="207">
it is covered with va&s;t impenetrable woods, mora&s;&s;es, and mountains; the only tolerable entrance to an army, is by the river St. Laurence; and the navigation of this river is rendered extremely difficult and hazardous by the number of &s;hal|lows, rifts and falls, that lye be|tween the di&s;charge of Ontario and the i&s;le of Montreal. Vaudreuil was in expectation, that the pre|parations nece&s;&s;ary for conduct|ing an army thro' &s;uch a long and difficult way, would nece&s;&s;arily con|&s;ume &s;o much of the &s;ummer, as not to leave &s;ufficient time for the operations ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to reduce the remainder of Canada. He did not apprehend much danger from the garri&s;on of Quebec, which had been weakened by its defeat in the &s;pring. The&s;e con&s;iderations gave him &s;ome confidence that he might protract the war &s;omewhat longer, and another year might po&s;&s;ibly give fortune an opportunity to take &s;ome turn in his favour.</P>
<P>But Mr. Amher&s;t, who&s;e calm and &s;teady re&s;olution no dif|ficulties could overcome, was tak|ing the mo&s;t effectual mea&s;ures to defeat his expectations. His plan was di&s;po&s;ed in this manner. Brigadier General Murray had or|ders to advance towards Montreal, on his &s;ide, with all the troops which could be &s;pared from the garri&s;on of Quebec. Colonel Haviland &s;ail|ed from Crown Point, and took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the I&s;le au Noix, which had been abandoned by the enemy on the 28th of Augu&s;t, and from thence had orders to proceed di|rectly to the city of Montreal. His own army, con&s;i&s;ting of about 10,000 men, he propo&s;ed to tran&s;|port by the way of Lake Ontario into the river St. Laurence. Thus he propo&s;ed entirely to &s;urround the la&s;t place of importance which the enemy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and by the motion of the three armies, in three &s;uch different routs, to render it impo&s;&s;ible for them to form an ef|fectual oppo&s;ition to any of his corps.</P>
<P>Having laid this general plan, he left Shenectady on <NOTE PLACE="marg">21. June.</NOTE> the frontiers of New York, and pa&s;|&s;ed up the Mohawks river and down that of the Oneidas, to O&s;wego, where he arrived on the 9th of July. The army he had collected there, con&s;i&s;ted of about 10,000 men, re|gulars and provincials. Sir William John&s;on brought a thou&s;and &s;avages of the Iroquois or five nations; the greate&s;t number of that race of men which was ever &s;een in arms in the cau&s;e of England.</P>
<P>It was a matter of the greate&s;t difficulty to tran&s;port &s;o numerous an army, the whole of its artillery, its ammunition, and all its provi|&s;ion, over the expan&s;e of that va&s;t lake in open boats and gallies; it required the greate&s;t caution and the exacte&s;t order, le&s;t they &s;hould fall foul upon one another, le&s;t they &s;hould be driven out too far to gain the land on the fir&s;t threatening of a &s;torm, or le&s;t they &s;hould come too near the &s;hore. But all the di&s;po&s;itions were made in the mo&s;t admirable method, and with that regularity of military arrangement, which makes &s;o con&s;iderable a part of the character of that able com|mander. So that the whole army embarked on the 10th of Augu&s;t. A detachment had been &s;ent &s;ome days before to clear the pa&s;&s;age of the river St. Laurence of any ob|&s;truction, and to find the be&s;t pa&s;&s;age for the ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>On the 27th he had entered that
<PB N="191" REF="208">
river, taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Swegatchie, and made all di&s;po&s;itions for the at|tack of L'I&s;le Royale, a fort lower down in the river which command|ed it, and by this command is the mo&s;t important po&s;t, and as it were the key of Canada. The troops and boats were &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, that the i&s;le was completely inve&s;ted, and the garri&s;on was left no means of e&s;|cape. The batteries were then rai&s;ed and opened, and after two days &s;harp firing, the fort &s;urrendered. <NOTE PLACE="marg">25 Aug.</NOTE></P>
<P>This being a po&s;t of importance both to command Lake Ontario and to cover our frontier, the ge|neral &s;pent &s;ome days here in order to repair the fort, and at the &s;ame time to fit out his ve&s;&s;els, and to prepare all things for pa&s;&s;ing his troops down the river, the mo&s;t dangerous part of which he was now to encounter, as all the rapids lie between this place and Montreal; but notwith&s;tanding all precautions near ninety men were drowned in pa&s;&s;ing the&s;e dangerous falls, and a great number of ve&s;&s;els broke to pieces. This lo&s;s from &s;o large an embarkation, in &s;uch circum&s;tances, is to be regarded as very incon&s;ider|able. At length, after a tedious, fatiguing and dangerous voyage of <NOTE PLACE="marg">6 Sept.</NOTE> two months and &s;eventeen days &s;ince they left Senec|tady, the Engli&s;h &s;aw to their great joy, the i&s;le of Montreal, the object of their ardent wi&s;hes, and the pe|riod of their labours.</P>
<P>They were immediately landed in the be&s;t order; and all di&s;po&s;itions were made for attacking the place. So excellently was this plan con|certed, and &s;o faithfully executed, that General Murray landed from Quebec that very day; and Col. Haviland with his army from I&s;le au Noix the day following.</P>
<P>Montreal is the &s;econd place in Canada for extent, building, traffick, and &s;trength. Its middle &s;ituation between the lakes and Quebec, hath made it the &s;taple of the Indian trade; but the fortifications before this war were mean and incon&s;i|derable; &s;omething has been &s;ince added; but nothing made the taking of it an enterpri&s;e of difficulty, except that here was collected the whole regular, and no &s;mall part of the provincial, force which remain|ed in Canada. However, by the di&s;po&s;itions which at once brought again&s;t them three armies, the greate&s;t part and the flower of the Briti&s;h troops in America, Mon&s;. Vaudreuil &s;aw him&s;elf entirely en|clo&s;ed; he de&s;paired of defending the place; and therefore &s;urrendered the garri&s;on of Montreal as <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They were not in &s;trictne&s;s pri&s;oners; but &s;ent to France with condition not to &s;erve during the war. The conditions may be &s;een more at large among the State Papers.</NOTE> pri&s;o|ners of war, and the inhabitants of his government as &s;ubjects to the King of Great Britain on the 8th of Sep|tember 1760.</P>
<P>And thus in the &s;ixth year of the war, and after the mo&s;t &s;e|vere &s;truggles, was the va&s;t country of Canada reduced to the king's obedience. In this time &s;ix battles had been fought, the fortune of which was equally divided; in three the French had been victorious; in three the Engli&s;h. The fir&s;t of tho&s;e in which the French had the better, was fought in the meadows near Fort du Que&s;ne, where General Braddock was killed; the other at Ticonderoga, where General Aber|crombie commanded; the third at
<PB N="192" REF="209">
Sillery, where General Murray was repul&s;ed. The victories of the Engli&s;h were, 1&s;t. that near Crown Point, where General John&s;on com|manded, and Die&s;kau was made pri|&s;oner; the 2d near Niagara, where General John&s;on al&s;o commanded; and the 3d and principal near Quebec, where Wolfe gained the victory and lo&s;t his life. From the Engli&s;h two forts had been taken, O&s;wego and Fort William-Henry. The Engli&s;h on their &s;ide took three cities; Loui&s;bourg, Quebec and Montreal; and five principal forts, which commanded as many im|portant communications, Beau&s;e|jour, Niagara, Frontenac, Ticon|deroga, Crown Point, and I&s;le-Royal; be&s;ides &s;ome others of in|ferior con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Taking the whole war in A|merica into one view, Canada had been defended with bravery and conduct &s;ufficient to crown the ge|nerals Wolfe and Amher&s;t, and the admirals Bo&s;cawen and Saunders, who finally reduced it, with the greate&s;t glory. And without que&s;tion, the conduct of General Amher&s;t in his la&s;t expedition, by which he obliged Montreal to &s;urrender without a blow, and finally conquered Ca|nada without effu&s;ion of blood, de&s;erves every honour and every recompence a grateful people can be&s;tow. The humanity with which he behaved to the conquered both French and Indians, though the one had perpetrated, and the other at lea&s;t connived at the mo&s;t hor|rid cruelties on the Engli&s;h pri|&s;oners, adds a high lu&s;tre to his conque&s;t. His troops &s;et not one hou&s;e on fire, not one habitation was plundered, not one man was killed (except in the attack of I&s;le-Royal). None was more di&s;tin|gui&s;hed in this re&s;pect than Sir William John&s;on; he led into Ca|nada an army of a thou&s;and of the fierce&s;t and mo&s;t cruel &s;avages which are bred in America, without doing the &s;malle&s;t damage to the country, or offering the &s;lighte&s;t injury to the per&s;ons of the inhabitants. To ef|fect this he was obliged to exert the mo&s;t unwearied endeavours, and the whole of tho&s;e uncommon ta|lents which give him &s;uch power over the minds of all &s;orts of men. The great victories by which he has advanced the intere&s;t of the na|tion, have done him le&s;s honour than this conduct, by which he has &s;o greatly advanced its character for humanity and moderation. It were to be wi&s;hed that the &s;ame might be &s;aid of the army, which marched from Quebec; who finding that the inhabitants in &s;ome parts were out in arms, were under a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;etting fire to the villages; the ten|derne&s;s of Gen. Murray's nature re|volted when the giving &s;uch orders became a nece&s;&s;ary part of his duty. In the cour&s;e of this &s;um|mer, Lord Byron with three <NOTE PLACE="marg">9 July.</NOTE> of his maje&s;ty's &s;hips de&s;troyed a &s;et|tlement of French, where none had ever been &s;u&s;pected, in the Bay de Chaleurs. There he al&s;o took three frigates; and about twenty &s;ail of ve&s;&s;els which contained a reinforcement of troops and military &s;tores for the relief of Montreal; but when they had received intelli|gence that Lord Colville's fleet had got into the river before them, and of cour&s;e entirely commanded it, they di&s;embarked in this place to at|tempt, if po&s;&s;ible, a way to their principal army by land. But they were di&s;covered; the whole arma|ment was taken; and the whole de|&s;ign di&s;concerted.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="210">
Before we take our leave of the American affairs of this year, we ought to make &s;ome mention of a war with the &s;avage Indians, which broke out on the back &s;ettlements of our &s;outhern colonies. The Che|rokees, one of the mo&s;t numerous and powerful nations of the&s;e bar|barians, had in the beginning, and during the greate&s;t part of the pro|gre&s;s of the war, appeared to be heartily engaged in our intere&s;ts; at their de&s;ire a fort had been built in their country called Fort Loudon, from the then commander in chief of the Briti&s;h forces in America. Some parties of them had appeared in our favour on the la&s;t expedition again&s;t Fort du Que&s;ne. But it is thought that on that occa&s;ion they received &s;ome in&s;ults, and had been treated in general with a neglect which made the deepe&s;t impre&s;&s;ion on the minds of &s;o vindictive a peo|ple. The&s;e di&s;contents were fo|mented by the French, who hoped to cau&s;e a diver&s;ion of a part of our forces in this quarter. At length they commenced ho&s;tilities in their u&s;ual manner, by cruel ravages and murders on the frontier of their neighbouring provinces. And there was very great rea&s;on to apprehend that the &s;ame artifices of the enemy, and the &s;ame opinion of ill u&s;age, would draw the neighbouring and powerful nation of the Creeks into the like mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>Mr. Lyttleton, who was then go|vernor of Carolina, having in vain endeavoured to pacify them, took the re&s;olution of march|ing with all the force, re|gular <NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 1759</NOTE> and provincial, which he could rai&s;e, into the Cherokee country. This army in all did not exceed 1100 men, but it was conducted with &s;uch &s;pirit and di&s;patch by Go|vernor Lyttleton, that in a very &s;hort time, he marched 300 miles through the va&s;t de&s;ert which lies between the Indian ca&s;tle of Keeowee and Charles-town. He was advanced into their country before they had made preparations to receive him. They &s;aw their towns in ca&s;e of ob|&s;tinacy on the point of being deliver|ed to fire and &s;word. They there|fore de&s;ired a conference, in which they acknowledged them&s;elves to blame; and con&s;ented to &s;uch a trea|ty of peace as the gover|nor was plea&s;ed to dictate. <NOTE PLACE="marg">26th Dec.</NOTE> They gave up the per&s;ons guilty of the mo&s;t flagrant murders, and put into his hands twenty-two ho&s;tages, as a &s;ecurity for their adherence to the treaty.</P>
<P>The governor had all imaginable rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied with the effect his expedition had produced; and having as every body believed ef|fectually cha&s;ti&s;ed the former in&s;o|lence of the enemy, and &s;ecured the future tranquillity of the &s;outhern provinces, he returned to Charles-town. But the&s;e perfidious bar|barians, equally regardle&s;s of their faith, and of the &s;afety of their countrymen, who&s;e lives were pledg|ed for their fidelity, broke out as &s;oon as the army was removed, into their former ravages; blocked up Fort Loudon, which &s;tands in the middle of their country, and made &s;ome attempts on Fort Edward, which lies nearer to the &s;ettlements. Their total want of &s;kill in carry|ing on &s;ieges prevented them from any hope of ma&s;tering the&s;e places, otherwi&s;e than by treachery or fa|mine. They failed in the fir&s;t in|&s;tance; and the la&s;t required time.</P>
<P>The imminent danger of two Engli&s;h garri&s;ons, and that whole tract of our colonies, being made known to General Amher&s;t, he de|tached Colonel Montgomery to
<PB N="194" REF="211">
their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, with a regiment of Highlanders, a battalion of the Royal Americans, a body of grenadiers, and the provincial troops. He marched into the ene|mies country. He made war upon the Indians after their own manner. No other would have been effectual. He burned E&s;tatoe the capital of the Lower Cherokees, con&s;i&s;ting of two hundred hou&s;es, an Indian town of the very fir&s;t magnitude; and then proceeded to the &s;ame ex|ecution on all the towns and villages of that di&s;trict of the Cherokees, which were numerous, populous, and wealthy. The inhabitants ge|nerally fled on the approach of our troops; &s;ome however were burned in their hou&s;es, and &s;ome women and children were made pri&s;on|ers.</P>
<P>This univer&s;al de&s;truction of the lower &s;ettlements being compleated, Colonel Montgomery pa&s;&s;ed on to the middle Cherokees: but as the army march|ed <NOTE PLACE="marg">27 June.</NOTE> through a dangerous ground, favourable to the Indian method of fighting, they were &s;udden|ly attacked upon all &s;ides by this &s;avage enemy, with the greate&s;t fu|ry, and with the u&s;ual horrible &s;creams and outcries. The troops were &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed with a view of this kind of war, that they &s;tood the charge with firmne&s;s; they were not intimidated with the covered fire, or the &s;creams of the &s;avages. The fight was long and well main|tained on both &s;ides. But at length the Indians fled. A neighbouring town (one of the mo&s;t con&s;i|derable) was entered that night. The enemy made &s;ome attempt to mole&s;t them; but to little purpo&s;e. The Engli&s;h lo&s;t in this action 20 killed, and about 80 wounded. The Cherokees had near forty killed. The number of the wounded is not known.</P>
<P>Though Colonel Montgomery was victorious on this occa&s;ion; yet it was nece&s;&s;ary to retreat on ac|count of his wounded, for whom he had no place of &s;afety. For if he &s;hould attempt to proceed, he had to apprehend frequent &s;kirmi&s;hes as he advanced, and the number of wounded together with the dif|ficulty of his march, would be hour|ly increa&s;ed. This retreat was cer|tainly nece&s;&s;ary. But when Colo|nel Montgomery had arrived at Fort St. George, he di&s;covered part of his orders, which threw the whole country into con&s;ternation; which was, that when he had <HI>cha&s;|ti&s;ed</HI> the enemy, he was to return to New-York with the troops un|der his command, and rejoin the grand army. The&s;e orders without delay he obeyed; not however with &s;uch rigour, but that the earne&s;t en|treaties of the province prevailed on him to leave about 400 men for their protection.</P>
<P>Carolina and the neighbouring colonies was again expo&s;ed to the fury of a &s;avage enemy, not &s;o much weakened as exa&s;perated by their late &s;ufferings; the fate of the garri&s;on of Fort London was but too certain. For &s;everal months they had &s;uffered a clo&s;e block|ade; at length, &s;eeing no hope of relief their provi&s;ions being total|ly con&s;umed and the ene|my &s;hewing &s;ome pacific di&s;|po&s;itions, <NOTE PLACE="marg">7. Aug.</NOTE> they were induced to &s;ur|render upon honourable conditions.</P>
<P>But the enemy, equally regard|le&s;s of faith and humanity, fell upon them in their march, butcher|ed all the officers but one, killed &s;everal of the private &s;oldiers, and carried the re&s;t into an horrible cap|tivity. The&s;e outrages on the &s;outh|ern
<PB N="195" REF="212">
colonies threw &s;ome damp on the joy which was felt over the Engli&s;h America, on the entire conque&s;t of Canada.</P>
<P>In Europe the fortune of the campaign was nearly ballanced. In America, except this incon&s;iderable &s;avage war, it was entirely tri|umphant. In the Ea&s;t-Indies al&s;o we gained glory and new advantages. After the rai&s;ing the &s;iege of Fort St. George, in February 1759, the Engli&s;h army took the field under Major Brere|ton, <NOTE PLACE="marg">16th April, 1759.</NOTE> and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves of the important town and fort of Conjiveram. About the &s;ame time the city of Ma&s;ulipatam was &s;tormed and taken by Major Ford. By the&s;e &s;trokes the French trade on the coa&s;t of Coromandel was confined to Pondicherry and a few incon&s;iderable places. And the traffick of the whole &s;hore for an extent of 800 miles of a populous and manufacturing country, was en|tirely in the hands of the Engli&s;h company. This coa&s;t joins to the rich province of Bengal; out of which al&s;o the French were entirely driven by the heroic actions of Co|lonel Clive.</P>
<P>Encouraged by the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es, a body of about 1200 men, Europeans and Seapoys, under the command of Major Brereton, advanced further, and attempted to di&s;lodge an army of French and their confederate Indians, encamped under the cannon of a fort of that country con&s;truction. The acqui&s;ition of that place had been a valuable advantage. But here our army was ob|liged <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept.</NOTE> to retire, with a lo&s;s of between three and four hundred killed and wounded.</P>
<P>General Lally animated with this and &s;ome &s;lighter advantages, threat|ened the &s;iege of Trichenopoly, and the French affairs &s;eemed again to revive. But it was only a momen|tary gleam. To check his progre&s;s, Colonel Coote at the head of the greate&s;t body he could draw together on that coa&s;t, inve&s;ted Wandewa&s;h, took the place in three days, and made the garri&s;on pri|&s;oners of war. From <NOTE PLACE="marg">30th Nov.</NOTE> thence he pa&s;&s;ed with rapidity to Ca|rongoly; the &s;iege of which town he pre&s;&s;ed with &s;uch diligence, that in four days from the opening his bat|teries, be obliged the gar|ri&s;on to march out. <NOTE PLACE="marg">10 Dec.</NOTE></P>
<P>This progre&s;s alarmed General Lally; he called large detachments in from every &s;ide; and knowing the importance of Wandewa&s;h, made all his efforts to recover it. He pu&s;hed forward the &s;iege with the utmo&s;t vigour; hoping to take the town before Colonel Coote could arrive to its relief. But the colonel marched with equal dili|gence; and arrived about the time when the French <NOTE PLACE="marg">22d July 1760.</NOTE> had made a practicable breach. His army con&s;i&s;ted of 1700 Europeans, and about 3000 black troops. Lally's amounted to 2200 Europeans, and between 9 and 10,000 blacks. The engagement was long and ob&s;tinate; but at length, the French gave way. It was a total rout; they abandoned their camp, their cannon, and all the im|plements of the &s;iege. They left a thou&s;and killed and wounded on the field of battle. Among the pri&s;o|ners were Brigadier General Bu&s;&s;y; the Chevalier Godeville, quarter|ma&s;ter general; Lieutenant Colonel Murphy, and eleven inferior offi|cers, who were all wounded. Lally fled with his broken troops in de&s;pair to Pondicherry.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="213">
Of the Engli&s;h in this action near 200 were killed and wounded; in particular the death of the gallant Major Brereton was much regret|ed. Of the blacks about 70 were wounded and &s;lain.</P>
<P>Except the battle of Pai&s;&s;y, fol|lowed by the revolution in Bengal, this action was the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in its con&s;equences, of any in which our troops had ever been engaged in India. This was fought in part a|gain&s;t European troops headed by an able general. The di&s;po&s;itions for the battle, and the conduct of Co|lonel Coote in the engagement, me|rit every honour.</P>
<P>This victory was pur&s;ued with a &s;pirit equal to that by which it was won. Chittiput was taken in a few days after; and the army al|lowing it&s;elf no repo&s;e, marched directly from thence to Arcot, the capital of this immen&s;e province. The &s;iege was opened on the fifth of February, and the fort &s;urrendered on the tenth; near 300 Europeans were made pri&s;oners of war.</P>
<P>At &s;ea Admiral Pocock &s;econded the extraordinary efforts of Colonel Coote with his own u&s;ual &s;kill and intrepidity. Again he en|gaged the fleet of Mon|&s;ieur d' <NOTE PLACE="marg">4th Sept. 1759.</NOTE> Ache, a brave commander, who has in &s;ome de|gree &s;upported the declining repu|tation of the French marine; but though &s;uperior in the number of his &s;hips, and more than in that proportion &s;uperior in guns and men, he was obliged after upwards of two hours &s;evere and bloody con|flict to give way before Admiral Po|cock, and to take &s;helter under the forts of Pondicherry. During this engagement eight of the Engli&s;h &s;hips &s;tood the fire of the whole French fleet, which con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ix|teen &s;ail. The &s;hips were great|ly &s;hattered; five hundred and &s;ixty of our &s;quadron were killed and wounded; and on the &s;ide of the French the lo&s;s was not le&s;s than a thou&s;and. Admiral Pocock imme|diately got him&s;elf again in a fighting condition, and braved the French fleet before Pondicherry, who lay under their cannon, and refu&s;ed a new engagement.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved that hi|&s;tory can hardly produce an in&s;tance of two &s;quadrons fighting three pitched battles, under the &s;ame com|manders, in eighteen months, with|out the lo&s;s of a &s;hip on either &s;ide. After this engagement Admiral Corni&s;h arrived on the coa&s;t of Co|romandel and joined Pocock, by which we attained &s;o decided a &s;u|periority in &s;trength, as we had be|fore in courage and ability, that the French no longer appeared in tho&s;e &s;eas. Mo&s;t of their &s;hips went off, as it was thought, to Mauritius. Then the French affairs went rapidly to ruin. On the fifth of April the im|portant fortre&s;s of Caracal &s;urrender|ed to the &s;ea and land forces under Admiral Corni&s;h and Major Monk|ton. By the taking of this and two other places of le&s;&s;er con&s;ideration, the French were actually reduced to the &s;ingle port of Pondicherry; which was when the&s;e accounts came away, clo&s;ely blocked up by land and &s;ea. The &s;tronge&s;t hopes are conceived that this capital of the French India power and commerce will &s;hortly be brought into our po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion; and with the&s;e plea&s;ing hopes we conclude the hi&s;tory of the war of 1760.</P>

Difficulties in the negotiation. De&s;ign of the campaign in He&s;&s;e, and of the expedition to Bellei&s;le.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AFTER a general war of five years, carried on with the greate&s;t effu&s;ion of blood, and the mo&s;t extraordinary expence ever known to attend a war of that continuance, it was hoped that, if the animo&s;ity of the belligerent powers was not abated, at lea&s;t a great part of the fuel of di&s;cord had been con&s;umed; and that the time was arrived for giving peace to Europe. Some propo&s;itions for that purpo&s;e had been made in the clo&s;e of the year 1759. Tho&s;e, who rather wi&s;hed for peace, than very attentively con&s;idered the proba|bility of effecting it, &s;eemed to think it might then have been expected. But whil&s;t the public was flattered with the&s;e hopes, the &s;ituation of affairs would not &s;uffer us to believe that they had any &s;olid foundation. We accordingly ventured to point out the difficulties which then ob|&s;tructed any &s;cheme for peace And as the&s;e difficulties were &s;uch, as did not attend that particular conjuncture only, but mu&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;t
<PB N="198" REF="215">
as long as the fortune of war con|tinued in the &s;ame train, we were from the beginning apprehen&s;ive that the new negotiation which we have &s;ince &s;een opened, and for &s;ome time carried on with &s;uch plea&s;ing appearances, might in the i&s;&s;ue be attended with no better &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>There are indeed but two &s;itua|tions in which peace can be very rationally expected. The fir&s;t &s;itua|tion is that of <HI>equality;</HI> and this is, either where nothing is gained on any &s;ide; &s;o that when ever mutual wearine&s;s, and unprofitable ho&s;ti|lities have calmed the ardor of the warring powers, no intricate points intervene to fru&s;trate the fir&s;t pa|cific di&s;po&s;ition; or it may be where the lo&s;&s;es are &s;o equal, that ex|changes may ea&s;ily be made, or the parties may re&s;t mutually &s;atisfied with their advantage over each other.</P>
<P>The &s;econd &s;ituation is that of <HI>nece&s;&s;ity;</HI> where one of the parties is &s;o entirely broken and reduced, as to &s;ubmit to receive conditions on the footing of conque&s;t, and to pur|cha&s;e repo&s;e by humiliating and en|feebling conce&s;&s;ions. A peace up|on this latter ba&s;is is always the grand popular object. In every war we flatter our&s;elves with the hope of it, again&s;t an experience almo&s;t uniform. In fact, it is to the la&s;t degree difficult to reduce any of the great powers of Europe to this di&s;graceful nece&s;&s;ity. For to reduce any one of them to this &s;tate of &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion, you mu&s;t, in a manner, re|duce all of them to it. The war, if it continues, draws &s;tate after &s;tate into its vortex, until all Europe is involved. A &s;ort of ballance is then produced, and the peace of conque&s;t becomes impracticable.</P>
<P>It would prove of the utmo&s;t mo|ment to the tranquility of mankind that this point were &s;ufficiently re|garded, and that they would wil|lingly adopt that &s;y&s;tem of equality, to which &s;ooner or later, with more or fewer &s;truggles, they are &s;o often compelled to &s;ubmit. When, &s;el|dom, a treaty is concluded on other terms, as the King of Pru&s;&s;ia has found by &s;evere experience, and as we ob&s;erved on a former occa&s;ion, is only a &s;hort ce&s;&s;ation, and not a perfect peace. But it mu&s;t be ac|knowledged that this &s;ituation, the mo&s;t coincident with their true in|tere&s;t, is at the &s;ame time the mo&s;t contradictory to the pa&s;&s;ions and prejudices of nations. It appears hard to lo&s;e upon every &s;ide every object of the war. A peace on this foundation will be cen&s;ured, but it is the be&s;t, on the &s;ame principle that the &s;horte&s;t follies are the be&s;t; and that no injured pride is left to brood over a future war. Contrary to the opinion of the warm patriots on all &s;ides, we therefore imagined that the year &s;eventeen hundred and fifty-eight, in the clo&s;e of the third campaign, was the happy moment for negotiation. At this time, however, no propo&s;itions had been made. The propo&s;itions of &s;eventeen hundred and fifty-nine were but &s;lightly regarded, and ob|viou&s;ly could end in nothing. But in the beginning of the year, of which we are now going to treat, the &s;cene of negotiation was open|ed with far greater &s;olemnity and parade; and as it was carried on with great diligence, it nece&s;&s;arily makes a principal part of the hi&s;tory of this year. It is indeed &s;ome|what fortunate both for the writers and the readers of the&s;e events that this treaty has intervened. The
<PB N="199" REF="216">
narrative otherwi&s;e had proved ex|tremely barren and unentertaining, For though the animo&s;ity of the bel|ligerent powers was not, as we ob&s;erved, abated, their efforts, how|ever, had con&s;iderably &s;lackened, and their operations began gradu|ally to degenerate into the Petite|guerre. Tho&s;e va&s;t events that a&s;toni&s;h the mind, or hold it in a plea&s;ing &s;u&s;pence; tho&s;e important battles and &s;ieges; tho&s;e rapid and well-conducted marches, and tho&s;e lively enterprizes which di&s;tingui&s;h the former years, except in a very few in&s;tances, &s;carce make any part of the hi&s;tory before us. But tho' the operations of the field had fallen into a &s;tate of languor, the cabinet became full of bu&s;ine&s;s, and nego|tiation flouri&s;hed. In this &s;itua|tion candour obliges us to acquaint our readers that we are &s;till more liable to mi&s;takes, than when we attempt to de&s;cribe the tran&s;actions of the campaign. It very frequent|ly happens, that the accounts of the military operations come authenti|cated from the hands of tho&s;e great generals who have conducted them, and when we have allowed for the partiality of the account, there is nothing to be detracted from them for want of &s;ufficient information. Even in the ca&s;e of partiality, we are often able to correct the mi&s;re|pre&s;entation or over-charge of one of the parties by that of the other. The&s;e things are done in the eye of the world. But the motives either to peace or war, and the &s;teps taken in a negotiation, are all behind the curtain. They do not appear for a long time, and &s;ometimes they never appear completely. There is however, an advantage in the pre|&s;ent conjuncture. For one of the powers at war, in order to ju&s;tify to its &s;ubjects and to the world, its part in the continuance of a war &s;o fatal to both, has publi&s;hed an ac|count of the late negotiation; art|ful indeed, and probably in &s;ome re&s;pects unfair; but containing at the &s;ame time many valuable and illu&s;trating pieces, the authenticity of which is not di&s;puted. The point in &s;uch ca&s;es to be dreaded is not the publication of fal&s;e pieces, but the concealment of &s;everal that are real and important. The public information is probably rather in|compleat, than untrue. We wait with impatience for that full and authentic narrative of &s;o important a negotiation, which undoubtedly our court propo&s;es to publi&s;h. We have delayed the &s;etting out our work the longer, in hopes of its appearance, by which we might have been able to perfect and cor|rect our account of this tran&s;action. The account of the Spani&s;h nego|tiation has appeared late, but we have not failed to make u&s;e of it. At pre&s;ent we engage in our work, under tho&s;e difficulties, which it is ju&s;t the reader &s;hould know and al|low for. In the &s;ucceeding year we &s;hall take care to profit of whatever further lights may be imparted.</P>
<P>Very early in this year 1761, the courts of Peter&s;burgh, Vienna, France, Sweden and Poland, agreed &s;everally and jointly to offer pro|po&s;als towards renewing that nego|tiation for peace, which had abrupt|ly been broken off in the clo&s;e of the year 1759. France was the principal and fir&s;t mover; for as it was her ambition which had made the war &s;o general, and her revenue which in a great mea&s;ure &s;upported it; the former being now humbled by a &s;eries of unfortunate events, and the latter reduced by mo&s;t enor|mous
<PB N="200" REF="217">
expences, &s;he began at length to relent, and apparently to de&s;ire peace in earne&s;t. The other mem|bers of the grand alliance could not decently, nor &s;afely oppo&s;e the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions of France. The court of Sweden in particular was given to under&s;tand, that the ex|hau&s;ted condition of France was the true motive of her moderation; that in fact, &s;he was not able any longer to furni&s;h the &s;tipulated &s;ub&s;idies, nor to adhere to the letter of her engagements with her allies. The&s;e circum&s;tances, which &s;he was neither able, nor &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to con|ceal, formed the &s;ure&s;t guaranty of her &s;incerity.</P>
<P>The five parties to the war on that &s;ide, made as many declara|tions, which were &s;igned at Paris on the 25th of March, and deliver|ed at London on the 31&s;t of the &s;ame month. The counter decla|ration of Great Britain and Pru&s;&s;ia appeared on the 3d of April. Aug&s;|burg, as the &s;ituation mo&s;t commo|dious for the powers at war, was appointed for the congre&s;s.</P>
<P>Lord Egremont, Lord Stormont amba&s;&s;ador in Poland, and general Yorke our amba&s;&s;ador in Holland, were nominated as the Engli&s;h plenipotentiaries. On the part of France, the count de Choi&s;eul was appointed. Aug&s;burg now became the centre of attention to all Europe, and each court prepared every thing towards this important meeting which it could furni&s;h of &s;plendor for the di&s;play of its dignity, and of ability for the &s;upport of its intere&s;t. The public conver&s;ation was for a while diverted from &s;cenes of horror, blood&s;hed, and pillage; and every mind was employed more agreeably on the public &s;cene of magnificence, and the private game of policy, which was to en&s;ue.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, it was unani|mou&s;ly agreed, in order that a ne|gotiation, in it&s;elf &s;ufficiently intri|cate, &s;hould be the le&s;s embarra&s;&s;ed, to admit to the treaty none but the parties principally concerned, to|gether with their allies.</P>
<P>Although this exclu&s;ion of the neutral intere&s;ts tended greatly to di&s;embarra&s;s and &s;implify the nego|tiation, yet &s;uch was the variety of &s;eparate and independent matters, which &s;till remained to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, that it became advi&s;eable to make a further &s;eparation, if they hoped to treat upon them with any tole|rable ea&s;e, or with any pro&s;pect of coming to a &s;peedy deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e it was nece&s;&s;ary to bring back the motives to the war to their fir&s;t principles; and to di&s;engage tho&s;e &s;everal intere&s;ts which originally, and in their own nature had no connection, from that ma&s;s, in which mutual injuries and a common animo&s;ity had blended and confounded them. This pro|po&s;ition came fir&s;t from France, and it was an early and happy omen of her inclination to peace.</P>
<P>The war, which was truly and originally German, evidently had but a &s;ingle, though this a very dif|ficult object, to determine the fate of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia. So many powers were concerned in this de|termination, and their views of ag|grandi&s;ement, indemnification, and revenge, &s;o various and difficult to be reconciled, that this alone &s;eem|ed matter enough for a &s;eparate and very arduous negotiation. In effect all the powers of the north were concerned in it. For this rea|&s;on, the other great object of the
<PB N="201" REF="218">
general war, the limits of America, which by that &s;trange chain of ho&s;tile connections, which even unites the various independent quarrels and enmities of Europe, had been mixed with the German di&s;putes, was again &s;et upon its proper and peculiar ba&s;is; and whil&s;t the truly German intere&s;ts were handled at Aug&s;burg, it was propo&s;ed to treat on this head &s;epa|rately in London and in Paris. For this purpo&s;e, mini&s;ters were mu|tually &s;ent from tho&s;e courts; Mr. Stanley on the part of England; and Mr. Bu&s;&s;y on that of France.</P>
<P>This propo&s;ition was al&s;o exceed|ingly prudent; for there is no doubt that if the&s;e potentates could &s;ettle their claims to their mutual &s;atis|faction; and &s;hould carry to Aug&s;|burg the &s;ame candour and good faith, and the &s;ame &s;incere de&s;ire of peace, their influence mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily tend to in&s;pire principles of moderation into the re&s;t, and mu&s;t contribute largely to accelerate the great work of pacification.</P>
<P>Things were thus &s;et upon the be&s;t footing po&s;&s;ible, and the nego|tiation &s;eemed to be in the happie&s;t train that could be wi&s;hed. But unfortunately the plan and di&s;po|&s;ition of the treaty was much more ea&s;ily adju&s;ted, than the matter and the &s;ub&s;tance. It was very obvious, that France, if &s;he was willing even to pretend to a de&s;ire of peace, could &s;carce avoid making conce&s;|&s;ions, which to her were &s;ufficiently mortifying. The moment her pro|per quarrel came to be &s;eparated from the general cau&s;e, &s;he had every di&s;advantage in the negotia|tion, becau&s;e &s;he had &s;uffered every di&s;a&s;ter in the war. On the &s;ide of Germany indeed &s;he had acted with &s;ucce&s;s; but even there the advan|tages &s;he had acquired were &s;till precarious, as the chance of war was &s;till open: no propo&s;ition for a ce&s;&s;ation of arms having been ad|mitted. As &s;he knew therefore, that great &s;acrifices might be expect|ed from her, &s;he did not &s;o finally re&s;t her hopes upon the negotiation, as not to look out for another re|&s;ource; and this rendered on her part the whole proceeding le&s;s effec|tive and le&s;s &s;incere.</P>
<P>The re&s;ource &s;he &s;ought was in Spain, who &s;he hoped could not look with indifference on the humi|liation of the principal branch of the hou&s;e of Bourbon. Hitherto indeed the king of Spain had ob|&s;erved a tolerably exact Neutrality in his conduct, and in his decla|rations had &s;pared no expre&s;&s;ions of good will and friend&s;hip to our court. He &s;eemed to be wholly intent on the internal oeconomy of his dominions, on the improvement of their long neglected police, on the advancement of their commerce, and the regulation of the finances. But notwith&s;tanding the&s;e dome&s;tic attentions, the French mini&s;try did not de&s;pair of drawing his regards abroad. They thought that the offers which France in her pre&s;ent circum&s;tances would find her&s;elf obliged to make, mu&s;t extremely alarm all good Spaniards, who could not &s;ee without the mo&s;t &s;erious apprehen&s;ions, the French power wholly annihilated in America. By this event, their colonies, though &s;o much &s;uperior to all others in opulence and extent, mu&s;t in a manner lie at the mercy of Eng|land: no power being in any &s;ort able to afford them a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or to hold the ballance between them and the power of England. At this time indeed, the French court had not ab&s;olutely &s;ucceeded in her de|&s;igns
<PB N="202" REF="219">
at Madrid: but &s;he was in hopes, that every &s;tep &s;he took in the treaty, and every conce&s;&s;ion &s;he &s;hould make, would prove a fre&s;h incentive to the jealou&s;ies and ap|prehen&s;ions of Spain. Thus in effect all the motions which France &s;eemingly made towards peace were in reality &s;o many &s;teps towards a new war; and whil&s;t at London &s;he breathed nothing but modera|tion, and the mo&s;t earne&s;t de&s;ire of putting a period to the calamities of Europe, at Madrid &s;he was taking the mo&s;t vigorous mea&s;ures for &s;preading them further, and continuing them longer.</P>
<P>On the &s;ide of England, though there was far more good faith in the public procedure, there were al&s;o, it mu&s;t be admitted, many circum&s;tances which co-operated to retard the peace. The great and almo&s;t unparallelled &s;ucce&s;s which attended our arms in this war, had rai&s;ed a proportionable expectation, and in&s;pired very high thoughts in|to the minds of the people. They thought it unrea&s;onable to make almo&s;t any conce&s;&s;ions to a nation who&s;e ambition and violence they had always found to corre&s;pond with its power, and whom they now con&s;idered as lying at their mercy. That this was the time for reducing France, which if we let pa&s;s, we could never hope again to recover. In the&s;e &s;entiments it mu&s;t have fared ill with that admi|ni&s;tration, who &s;hould make a &s;acri|fice of any of tho&s;e objects on which the people had &s;et their hearts.</P>
<P>On the other hand, it could not have e&s;caped them, that the &s;itua|tion of affairs in Germany, how|ever they might be artificially &s;e|parated in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily have an influence on the final determination of the treaty. They &s;aw, that after a &s;evere &s;trug|gle of five years, the affairs of our neare&s;t allies were only not ruined. To &s;ay nothing of the condition of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, the whole country of He&s;&s;e was in the actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of France; they likewi&s;e held the county of Hanau; and by their occupation of Gottingen, the Hanoverian territory lay open to their arms. If this quarrel &s;hould be con&s;idered as a cau&s;e not &s;trictly Engli&s;h (though the French in their memorials contended it was), yet certainly the He&s;&s;ians, and princi|pally the Hanoverians, were allies of &s;o near a connection, and had done and &s;uffered &s;o much in the common cau&s;e, that it mu&s;t have appeared &s;hocking to all Europe, if &s;olely attentive to our own pecu|liar advantages, we &s;hould patch up a peace without any provi&s;ion in their favour: and it was very evi|dent, that this provi&s;ion could not be made in the &s;ituation in which the la&s;t campaign had left them, unle&s;s our government purcha&s;ed it at a price that would be very grudg|ingly paid by the Engli&s;h &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>The mini&s;try, perplexed between the natural expectations of their country, and the rea&s;onable ex|pectations of their allies, mu&s;t have found it not a little difficult to know what party they ought to take. In order to reconcile, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the&s;e contradic|tory de&s;ires, the only &s;olution which could be found was to pu&s;h the war with the utmo&s;t vigour; and in the mean time not to hurry the nego|tiation; in hopes that during its progre&s;s things might take &s;uch a turn, as to enable them to purcha&s;e peace for their allies out of the ac|qui&s;itions they &s;hould have made
<PB N="203" REF="220">
after the commencement of the treaty, and without being obliged to have recour&s;e to their conque&s;ts, previous to that aera. On this footing they propo&s;ed to &s;atisfy the de|mands of the public faith, and at the &s;ame time to pre&s;erve the repu|tation which was &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to their affairs at home. Accordingly the duke of Brun&s;wick was to pro|&s;ecute with the utmo&s;t vigour, the operations which he had begun in the depth of winter; and an ex|pedition, the object of which was then &s;ecret, was prepared with equal diligence in England.</P>
<P>In the&s;e equivocal di&s;po&s;itions, and in this odd mixture of ho&s;tile and pacificmea&s;ures, began the year 1761, a year more remarkable, perhaps, than any of tho&s;e we have hitherto de&s;cribed, for events which will be radically deci&s;ive of the future pro&s;|perity or mi&s;ery of Europe, but le&s;s for tho&s;e matters by which the ima|gination of the reader is commonly affected. Having in this chapter laid down, as far as we can con|jecture, the political motives for the uncommon effort which was made in Germany, in our next chapter we &s;hall give an account of the mi|litary plan of this effort, the exe|cution and the &s;ucce&s;s of it.</P>

<P>AT the clo&s;e of the la&s;t cam|paign, the French had the entire and undi&s;turbed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole territory of He&s;&s;e: a country tolerably provided, and which contains many tenable places. Some of the&s;e they had &s;trengthen|ed with additional works; and they had ama&s;&s;ed immen&s;e magazines in the mo&s;t convenient &s;ituations. This was their condition in the front of their winter cantonments. On their left they had driven the allies from the Lower Rhine, where they kept a con&s;iderable body of troops, which &s;treightened our quarters, and checked our efforts on that &s;ide. On their right they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the town of Gottingen, in which they had placed a very &s;trong gar|ri&s;on; and thus they &s;hut us up on this quarter al&s;o, whil&s;t the king's German dominions lay entirely open to their enterprizes.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider the &s;ituation of the French armies, they will pre|&s;ent us with the idea of an immen&s;e cre&s;cent, the two advanced points of which were at Gottingen and We&s;el and the body extended in He&s;&s;e: &s;o that being perfectly well provided with magazines, and ma&s;ter of all the proper communications nece&s;|&s;ary for their current &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, with &s;trong places in their rear, and in both their flanks; in the next campaign they had only to advance their &s;everal po&s;ts in a manner to enclo&s;e the allied army, which, without &s;ome &s;ignal &s;ucce&s;s (from their numbers and &s;ituation, hardly to be expected) would find it|&s;elf
<PB N="204" REF="221">
entirely incapable of making any &s;tand again&s;t them.</P>
<P>Prince Ferdinand was very &s;en|&s;ible of the&s;e inconveniencies of his &s;ituation, and of the advantages the enemy had over him. It was ex|tremely difficult to &s;ettle a plan for action; but no action could be at|tended with much wor&s;e con&s;e|quences, than inactivity in a bad condition. He knew from expe|rience, that the French were ill qualified for winter operations in Germany, and that his own &s;oldiers, be&s;ides their &s;uperior hardine&s;s, and their being inured to the rigour of the climate, could &s;uffer but little more from field &s;ervice, e&s;pecially if attended with &s;ucce&s;s, than they mu&s;t endure from the badne&s;s of their winter quarters. It is true that there was &s;omething di&s;courag|ing in the attack of a very &s;uperior body of the enemy, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every advantage again&s;t him: but it was clear, that this &s;uperiority, and the&s;e advantages would not le&s;&s;en as the &s;ummer approached. It was clear, that every &s;tep the enemy gained on him, would render his defence weaker and his re&s;ources more &s;canty; and that if the enemy found them&s;elves in a condition to commence this campaign where they had concluded the la&s;t, and that no|thing &s;hould hinder their proceeding in the earlie&s;t &s;ea&s;on, he could never rea&s;onably hope to protract the war to another year. For to &s;peak the truth, this was the utmo&s;t, which in his circum&s;tances he could pro|mi&s;e him&s;elf from the mo&s;t judi|cious &s;cheme of conduct.</P>
<P>Having therefore re&s;olved to act, he lo&s;t no time to act with vigour. He appointed three places of ren|dezvous on the Dymel, the Rhine, and in Saverland. His army a&s;|&s;embled on the 9th of February, without &s;uffering the enemy to have any previous notice of their inten|tions. The next day the troops halted, and the duke communicat|ed to his generals the di&s;po&s;ition he had made for the motions of the whole.</P>
<P>The centre was led by his &s;erene highne&s;s in per&s;on; it penetrated directly into He&s;&s;e, and marching by Zierenberg and Durenberg, made its way towards Ca&s;&s;el. The right and left of the army were each at a very con&s;iderable di&s;tance from this body; but they were &s;o di&s;po&s;ed as fully to co-operate in the general plan of operation, which was very exten&s;ive. The heredi|tary prince commanded on the right: he marched by Stadbergen for Mengeringhau&s;en; and leaving the country of He&s;&s;e to the Ea&s;t|ward, as the alarm was to be as &s;udden, and as widely diffu&s;ed as po&s;&s;ible, he pu&s;hed forward with the utmo&s;t expedition into the heart of the French quarters. Gen. Sporcken commanded a corps at a greater di&s;tance to the left, and penetrated into Thuringia, by Du|der&s;tadt and Heiligen&s;tadt. The de&s;ign of this movement was to break the communication of the French with the army of the empire, to open one for our&s;elves with the Pru&s;&s;ians, and to cut off all inter|cour&s;e between the grand army of the enemy, and their garri&s;on at Gottingen.</P>
<P>By this &s;udden, exten&s;ive, and vigorous attack, the French were thrown into the utmo&s;t con&s;terna|tion: they retreated, or rather fled upon ever &s;ide. It could &s;carcely have been imagined, that this was the &s;ame army which had but ju&s;t clo&s;ed the campaign with &s;o much
<PB N="205" REF="222">
&s;ucce&s;s. Such has been the &s;port of fortune in this war, even beyond all former examples of her caprice, that the in&s;tances are numerous of inferior and beaten armies, without any apparent change in their cir|cum&s;tances, driving the conquerors before them. So remarkable was the revolution of fortune at this time, that it is highly credible if the French had had their quarters in an open country, their army had been totally de&s;troyed: but happily for them, they had very &s;ufficient means of &s;ecuring their retreat. For as the allies advanced, they were obliged to leave Ca&s;&s;el and Gottin|gen at their backs; into the former of which the enemy had thrown a garri&s;on equal to a moderate army; and in the latter they had &s;even or eight thou&s;and men. Beyond the&s;e again were Fritzlar, Ziegenhayn, and Marpurg, places of a tolerable degree of &s;trength and well gar|ri&s;oned, be&s;ides &s;ome other inferior po&s;ts.</P>
<P>The hereditary prince, who&s;e party was the mo&s;t advanced, &s;truck the fir&s;t blow, by an attempt to &s;ur|prize Fritzlar. He had received advice that it was not prepared to receive him. He accordingly took only a few battalions and no can|non, in hopes of being able to carry that place at once. But un|fortunately he was deceived in his intelligence. The garri&s;on was prepared and re&s;olute, and though the hereditary prince attacked it with his u&s;ual &s;pirit, he was obliged for that time to de&s;i&s;t, and to draw off with no incon&s;iderable lo&s;s.</P>
<P>About this time, Marpurg was attempted in the &s;ame manner, and with no better &s;ucce&s;s. General Breidenback, an Hanoverian of|ficer, of great bravery; experience and reputation, who commanded there, lo&s;t his life in the attack. The&s;e two &s;evere checks at the entrance into action, did not, however, di&s;courage either the parties that &s;uffered them, or the re&s;t of the army. They advanced as expeditiou&s;ly, and with more caution. Cannon and mortar were brought before Fritzlar, which, after a defence that was rather made for the credit of the com|mander, than from any hope of &s;aving the place, <NOTE PLACE="marg">15 Feb.</NOTE> &s;urrendered on honourable terms. A large magazine was found here. The marquis of Granby was employ|ed, with &s;ucce&s;s in reducing the forts and ca&s;tles in this neighbourhood. The allied army re&s;olutely advanc|ed, and as they advanced, the French continually retired, aban|doning po&s;t after po&s;t, and fell back almo&s;t to the Maine. They fired their magazines as they retreated; but the allies pur&s;ued with &s;o much rapidity, that they &s;aved five capi|tal &s;tores; one of which contained no le&s;s than eighty thou&s;and &s;acks of meal, fifty thou&s;and &s;acks of oats, and a million of rations of hay, a very &s;mall part of which had been de&s;troyed. The&s;e were ac|qui&s;itions of the utmo&s;t advantage, as they wonderfully facilitated the progre&s;s of the army; which as it advanced, &s;till found its &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; provi&s;ion was al&s;o thereby made for the cavalry, which otherwi&s;e, it could never have been &s;upplied with in &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on, and at &s;uch a va&s;t di&s;tance from our original quarters.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this &s;ucce&s;s in front, it was not here the grand object of our operations lay. Ca&s;&s;el was to be reduced. The French had in that town a garri&s;on of
<PB N="206" REF="223">
&s;eventeen battalions, be&s;ides &s;ome other corps, under the command of the count de Broglio; and there was no doubt, that he would de|fend the place to the utmo&s;t. The fortifications of Ca&s;&s;el are mo&s;tly in the old manner; they con&s;i&s;t of very high, but &s;trong walls. Some works indeed had been newly add|ed; but the great hope of the ene|my was in the &s;trength of the gar|ri&s;on and the rigour of the &s;ea&s;on. The &s;iege of this place was not to be delayed; however it was nece&s;|&s;ary prevou&s;ly to clear all the ad|jacent country of the enemy, and to cut off the communication of the garri&s;on with their grand army.</P>
<P>Therefore when mar&s;hal Broglio had been driven quite out of He&s;&s;e, and had retreated towards Frank|fort, prince Ferdinand cea&s;ed to advance; and having ordered two bodies to the blockade of Marpurg and Ziegenhayn, which &s;till ob&s;ti|nately held out, he formed that part of the army which was with him into a chain of cantonments, making a front towards the enemy which extended from the river Lahn to the river Ohm, and from the Ohm to the Fulda; thus he propo&s;ed to watch the motions of Mar&s;hal Broglio's army, to cover the &s;iege of Ca&s;&s;el, and the blockades of the two fortre&s;&s;es ju&s;t mentioned. The &s;iege of Ca&s;&s;el was carried on by the count of Lippe Schaumburg, a &s;overeign prince of the empire, re|puted one of the able&s;t engineers in Europe: His management of the artillery at Thornhau&s;en was a prin|cipal cau&s;e in the acqui&s;ition of that great victory; and it was not doubt|ed that his abilities would be ex|erted as effectively at Ca&s;&s;el. Tren|ches were opened on the fir&s;t of March. All eyes were now directed to this point; for on the &s;ucce&s;s of this &s;troke depended the whole for|tune of the campaign. It was very apparent that if Ca&s;&s;el and its garri&s;on &s;hould fall into the hands of the allies, Gottingen and the inferior places mu&s;t inevitably fall along with it; and this misfortune would be more than equivalent to the lo&s;s of a great battle.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the war was thus carried on in He&s;&s;e, M. Sporken who com|manded the detachment to the left, on the &s;ide of Saxony, advanced with an intrepidity equal to the re&s;t; he was &s;oon joined by a corps of Pru&s;&s;ians, and the united army lo&s;t no time to clear the Werra and the Un&s;trut of the bodies of French and Saxons which ocupied the mo&s;t important po&s;ts upon the&s;e ri|vers. As the&s;e bodies were ad|vantageou&s;ly po&s;ted, and could be &s;upported on one &s;ide by the gar|ri&s;on of Gottingen, and on the other, as they promi&s;ed them&s;elves, by the army of the empire, they maintained their ground; and this &s;oon brought on a &s;harp action. The allies attacked a large body advantage|ou&s;ly <NOTE PLACE="marg">14th Feb.</NOTE> po&s;ted at Langen&s;altze upon the Un&s;trut; the event was en|tirely favourable. Three whole bat|talions of Saxons were made pri|&s;oners by the Pru&s;&s;ians; M. de Sporcken took two battalions. The enemy's lo&s;s was computed at five thou&s;and men; &s;everal pieces of cannon were al&s;o taken, and a large magazine was abandoned. This blow was well followed; one body of the combined army pu&s;hed to Ei&s;e|nach and Gotha, whil&s;t another by forced marches got forward to Ful|da; the French gave way on their right, and the army of the empire on the left; the latter fell back to
<PB N="207" REF="224">
Bamberg, totally abandoning a very large tract of country.</P>
<P>Hitherto the affairs of the allies proceeded almo&s;t in an uninter|rupted cour&s;e of pro&s;perity. It was indeed a degree of pro&s;perity altogether a&s;toni&s;hing, and which as at fir&s;t it could &s;carcely have been expected, &s;o there was no rea&s;on to imagine it would have any long continuance. For the al|lies on the &s;ide of Saxony, where M. Sporcken acted, in proportion as their activity and &s;ucce&s;s carried them forward, left the countries on their rear more and more un|covered, and expo&s;ed, without any or with a very in&s;ufficient defence, to the attempts of the powerful garri&s;on of Gottingen. The count de Vaux, who commanded that garri&s;on, is a very able and enter|pri&s;ing officer. And he no &s;ooner perceived, that the allies were wholly intent upon driving their enemies from the Werra and Un|&s;trut, and on pu&s;hing the advan|tages they had acquired to the ut|mo&s;t, than he marched out of Got|tingen with a &s;trong detachment, attacked and routed an Hanoverian convoy, fell upon the town of Du|der&s;tadt with the utmo&s;t violence; and though he failed in his fir&s;t at|tempt, he repeated it with &s;o much &s;pirit, that at length he carried that town, and afterwards &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable places near it. By the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es he prevented M. de Sporcken's corps from return|ing by the way they had advanced, and indeed ab&s;olutely di&s;qualified them from acting &s;eperately from their main army; to which &s;oon after the&s;e events, they were o|bliged to join them&s;elves. This junction now became nece&s;&s;ary on another account.</P>
<P>Mar&s;hal Broglio towards the clo&s;e of the la&s;t campaign had been obliged, by the enterpri&s;es of the hereditary prince, to detach from his army in He&s;&s;e a large body to the Lower Rhine. He now found it equally proper to recall this body together with further reinforce|ments, in order to maintain his ground in the country northward of the Maine, where he was clo&s;e|ly pre&s;&s;ed by the allies, and which he mu&s;t be compelled &s;hamefully to relinqui&s;h, if Ca&s;&s;el was not relieved in time. Sen&s;ible of this, with whatever difficulty, he called in his mo&s;t di&s;tant po&s;ts, embodied his army, in&s;pired them with new &s;pirits, and made them capable, by a more exact order in their di&s;ci|pline and a great &s;uperiority in their numbers, of attempting &s;omething con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the hopes of the allies depended on the effect of their fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion; they were obliged to attempt too many ob|jects at the &s;ame time, and the&s;e too arduous for the number of which their army con&s;i&s;ted. For it was nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould keep one army, and that no &s;mall one, employed on the &s;iege of Ca&s;&s;el; a|nother was occupied in the blockade of Ziegenhayn; a third was em|ployed to the ea&s;tward of the Ful|da; and &s;till a fourth was nece&s;&s;ary to cover and &s;u&s;tain all the&s;e vari|ous operations, and to oppo&s;e it&s;elf to the attempts of mar&s;hal Broglio. It was but too plain, that when the whole of the French force was col|lected in one point, it could never be re&s;i&s;ted by a part only of the al|lied army; if they &s;hould attempt to draw away any of the &s;eparate corps from the critical &s;ervice upon which it was employed, the entire
<PB N="208" REF="225">
purpo&s;e of their labours was given up. In a word, prince Ferdinand had three &s;trong po&s;ts of the enemy on his rear, and their grand army now perfectly united on his front, and his &s;ituation, which was far from advantageous, obliged him to call in M. Sporcken's body which had effected its purpo&s;e and could be&s;t be &s;pared. However the prince kept his po&s;ition as long as po&s;&s;ible; and the &s;iege was carried on with as much vigour as a winter operation, and the &s;pirited defence of a great garri&s;on ably commanded, would admit.</P>
<P>But mar&s;hal Broglio, as &s;oon as he had collected his army, advanc|ed without delay. He cau&s;ed the troops under the hereditary prince to be attacked near the village of Stangerode, in the neighbourhood of Grunberg, where he was advanc|ed in front of the before-mentioned line of the allied army. The at|tack was made by the enemies dragoons, the very fir&s;t &s;hock of which broke the whole foot, con|&s;i&s;ting of nine regiments, Hanove|rians, He&s;&s;ians, and Brun&s;wickers. The French on this occa&s;ion made two thou&s;and pri&s;oners, and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of &s;everal trophies of victory; few were killed or wounded on either &s;ide.</P>
<P>After this blow the allied army could no longer think of making head again&s;t the French, or of maintaining their ground in He&s;&s;e. They broke up the blockade of Zie|genhayn; and &s;oon after rai&s;ed the &s;iege of Ca&s;&s;el, after twenty-&s;even days open trenches. They evacuat|ed the whole country of He&s;&s;e, re|tiring behind the Dymel, and fall|ing back nearly to the quarters they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed before this undertaking.</P>
<P>Thus ended an expedition which was carried on again&s;t many diffi|culties, with much &s;pirit, and which at fir&s;t excited great hopes. It failed indeed in &s;ome of its objects; but it produced its effect in the to|tal of the operations of the year. The French, by the de&s;truction or &s;eizure of &s;o many of their princi|pal magazines, were for a long time di&s;abled from taking any advantage of their &s;ucce&s;&s;es in the preceding campaign, or from their late victo|ry. It was not until the &s;ea&s;on was a good deal advanced that they were in a condition to act. This ce&s;&s;ation was not dearly bought even by the lo&s;s we &s;u&s;tained at Stangerode, and the extreme hard|&s;hips the troops had endured dur|ing the whole &s;ervice; for circum|&s;tanced as both armies were at their quitting the field, without this &s;ea|&s;onable check it is probable we &s;hould have at this day no footing in Germany. Both armies as it were by con&s;ent lay quiet in their winter quarters. During their in|action, the negotiation at London and Paris, who&s;e commencement we have related in the fir&s;t chapter, was pur&s;ued without interruption.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. <HI>The negotiation continued. Propo&s;ition of</HI> uti po&s;&s;idetis. <HI>Debate con|cerning the periods. Bellei&s;le de&s;cribed. Engli&s;h repul&s;ed at Lochma|ria bay. They make good their landing. Palais be&s;ieged. Town a|bandoned. Citadel capitulates.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that after the judicious &s;eparations which had been made of the intere&s;ts of the &s;everal powers at war, there &s;till remained a &s;ufficient fund of in|tricacy and altercation in each par|ticular di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. In order there|fore to make the way to peace as &s;mooth as po&s;&s;ible, it was re&s;olved previou&s;ly to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;ome certain and &s;imple points that might &s;erve to direct and keep &s;teady the whole negotiation. The&s;e points were but two; indeed they were &s;o in&s;epa|rably connected with each other, that they &s;eem rather members of the &s;ame propo&s;ition than &s;eparate articles. The fir&s;t was, <HI>that the two crowns &s;hall remain in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on of what they have conquered one from the other.</HI> The &s;econd im|ported that, <HI>the &s;ituation in which they &s;hall &s;tand at certain periods, &s;hall be the po&s;ition to &s;erve as a ba&s;is for the treaty which may be negotiated between the two powers.</HI></P>
<P>As France was known to have had the wor&s;t in the war, a propo|&s;ition of <HI>&s;tatu quo,</HI> coming from her, mu&s;t have appeared an in&s;tance of moderation, altogether &s;urprizing to our mini&s;ters. It is certain, that had peace been concluded at that in&s;tant, and upon the &s;ole founda|tion of this article, England would then have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the conque&s;ts &s;he had made, every one of which was in a very high degree advan|tageous to her commerce and her power, and none of which could be con&s;idered as a &s;ubject of future di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. On the other hand, France continuing in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the places &s;he had conquered, would have acquired no advantage that could at all countervail the expence of keeping them; at the &s;ame time that &s;he would be expo&s;ed to end|le&s;s altercations, and would afford matter of the highe&s;t jealou&s;y, in|dignation, and di&s;content, even to her neare&s;t allies. This ba&s;is being therefore &s;ettled, although it was evident, that the treaty could not re&s;t upon this ba&s;is &s;olely, England had certainly a great &s;uperiority in the negotiation, and might rational|ly expect (when they &s;hould come to talk of re&s;titutions) to purcha&s;e the evacuation of the French conque&s;ts in Germany, at a much &s;maller price than their apparent magnitude might &s;eem to demand. However the&s;e were &s;till a matter of &s;o much anxiety, and the nature of the pre|ci&s;e &s;tipulations were &s;till &s;o uncer|tain, that the negotiation, though it proceeded with &s;trong appearance of a de&s;ire for peace, met with very frequent checks and delays. Both parties were indeed unanimous in the article of <HI>uti po&s;&s;idetis;</HI> than which, it mu&s;t be admitted, there could not be a better ground to treat upon. But as the war &s;till continued, and whil&s;t it continued might make a daily alteration in the fortune of the contracting pow|ers, it was nece&s;&s;ary to fix upon &s;ome epochas to which this po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ory article &s;hould refer.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="227">
The French on this head pro|po&s;ed, <HI>that the &s;ituation in which they &s;hall &s;tand on the</HI> fir&s;t of Sep|tember in the year 1761 <HI>in the Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> on the fir&s;t of July in the &s;ame year <HI>in the We&s;t Indies and in Africa, and on</HI> the fir&s;t of May following <HI>in Europe, &s;hould be the po&s;ition, which &s;hould &s;erve as a ba&s;is to the treaty which may be negotiated between the two powers.</HI> They added further, that as the&s;e epochas might &s;eem too near or too di&s;tant for the intere&s;t of Great Britain, they were extremely wil|ling to enter into a negotiation up|on that object.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h mini&s;try received this propo&s;ition with le&s;s &s;atisfac|tion than its apparent fairne&s;s de|&s;erved. They entirely rejected the French epochas; and declared that they could not admit, without pre|judice to them&s;elves, any other e|pochas than tho&s;e which <HI>have re|ference to the day of &s;igning the treaty of peace.</HI> Had this re&s;olu|tion been &s;trictly adhered to, it was evident that the negotiation was that moment at an end. For though what was a&s;&s;erted in the French me|morial in reply to this declaration, <HI>(that the ba&s;is of the propo&s;ition of</HI> uti po&s;&s;idetis <HI>was nece&s;&s;arily connect|ed with the particular epochas pro|po&s;ed)</HI> is by no means to be admit|ted; it is on the other hand not ea|&s;y to deny the validity of their &s;ub+&s;equent a&s;&s;ertion, "that if not the&s;e, at lea&s;t <HI>&s;ome</HI> certain periods during the war ought to be fixed; and that the <HI>uti po&s;&s;idetis</HI> could not rea|&s;onably have reference only to the time of &s;igning the treaty of peace." For if the contrary principle were once admitted, it would become difficult to know, or even with pro|bability to gue&s;s, at the nature or the value of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions which by &s;uch an article &s;hould be mutu|ally given away. And if the&s;e difficulties occurred in the &s;impli|city of a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ory article, they mu&s;t be increa&s;ed tenfold upon every other, and mu&s;t come to &s;uch an height as to preclude all po&s;&s;ibility of negotiation on things of &s;o intricate a nature as exchan|ges and equivalents. The French in their memorial in&s;i&s;ted &s;o &s;trong|ly on the propriety of e&s;tabli&s;hing the&s;e periods, that they threatened to recal the whole propo&s;ition if they were not agreed to.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t doubtle&s;s appear at fir&s;t view &s;urprizing, to &s;ee France, who&s;e actual &s;ituation was very in|different, contending for a near period, and England, who&s;e affairs were at that time apparently in a pro&s;perous &s;ituation, po&s;tponing the <HI>uti po&s;&s;idetis</HI> to one more re|mote. But the truth is, that in that particular neither party con|&s;ulted their pre&s;ent condition. They acted wholly on fore&s;ight. For though the Engli&s;h, on the 25th of March, when this propo&s;ition was made, were carrying on the &s;iege of Ca&s;&s;el, and the other &s;trong places in He&s;&s;e, and the enemy had no army in that country to oppo&s;e them, it was notwith&s;tanding evi|dent that from the &s;low progre&s;s of tho&s;e &s;ieges, and from the ala|crity of mar&s;hal Broglio in collect|ing his troops, they mu&s;t be &s;hortly obliged to abandon the enterprize; it was evident that France mu&s;t be rein&s;tated in the ab&s;olute po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her former conque&s;ts long be|fore the epocha of the fir&s;t of May, the period which they fixed for Europe. Both courts were fully apprized of this. It was therefore
<PB N="211" REF="228">
the intere&s;t of France to offer and of England to reject this near period; e&s;pecially as the fate of the de&s;ign on the coa&s;t of France was then depending, and our ad|mini&s;tration &s;eemed to have con|ceived no mean hopes of its &s;uc|ce&s;s, and no &s;mall opinion of its importance in the negotiation.</P>
<P>The fleet employed in this ex|pedition &s;ailed from Spithead on the 29th of March, and it was &s;oon di&s;covered that Bellei&s;le was the object.</P>
<P>Bellei&s;le, the large&s;t of all the European i&s;lands belonging to the French king, is between 12 and 13 leagues in circumference.</P>
<P>The i&s;land originally belonged to the earl of Cornouaille, but has been &s;ince yielded to the king: it contains only one little city, cal|led Le Palais, three country towns, 103 villages, and about 5000 in|habitants.</P>
<P>The town of Palais takes its name from a ca&s;tle, belonging to the duke de Bellei&s;le, in its neighbour|hood, which is now converted into a citadel, which is a regular and &s;trong fortification, fronting the &s;ea, compo&s;ed principally of horn|work, and is provided with two dry ditches, the one next the counter&s;carp, and the other &s;o contrived as to &s;ecure the interior fortifications. This citadel is di|vided from the large&s;t part of the town by an inlet of the &s;ea, over which there is a bridge of com|munication; from the other part of the town, and which is mo&s;t inhabited, it is only divided by its own fortifications, and a glacis. There are three nominal har|bours in this i&s;land, Palais, Sauzon and Goulfard; every one of which labours under &s;ome capital defect, either in being expo&s;ed, &s;hallow, or dangerous at the entrance. The only branch of trade car|ried on here is the curing pil|chards.</P>
<P>From this &s;tate of the i&s;land, poor in it&s;elf, capable of little im|provement, and &s;o ill circum|&s;tanced in point of harbours, a &s;ort of a di&s;like to the expedition began to ari&s;e. Several did not &s;ee of what con&s;iderable &s;ervice &s;uch a conque&s;t could be of to England in time of peace, or of what pre|judice to the enemy in time of war. They fore&s;aw that it could not be taken without con&s;iderable lo&s;s, or kept without con&s;iderable expence; and on the whole they apprehended that when exchanges came to be made, France would lay no great &s;tre&s;s upon it. On the other hand it was urged, that though the harbours were bad, yet &s;mall privateers might i&s;&s;ue from thence, greatly to the mo|le&s;tation of the French coa&s;ting trade; and that the fleet of England might ride between it and the con|tinent in a well protected road. They imagined the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this i&s;land, if not of great detri|ment to the intere&s;t of France, would be a grievous wound to her pride; and that tho&s;e circum|&s;tances which had formerly indu|ced her to expend money on the fortifications there, and on the ap|prehen&s;ion of an inva&s;ion to fill them with a powerful garri&s;on, would likewi&s;e per&s;uade her to &s;et a value on the place when it came to be e&s;timated in the treaty.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t they rea&s;oned in this man|ner in England, the fleet under the command of commodore Keppel, and the land forces under gene|ral Hodg&s;on, arrived before Bellei&s;le
<PB N="212" REF="229">
on the 7th of April, and on the 8th agreed to attempt a landing on the &s;outh-ea&s;t of the i&s;land in a &s;andy bay near Lochmaria point. Here the enemy were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a little fort; they had more|over entrenched them&s;elves on an hill exce&s;&s;ively &s;teep, and the foot of which was &s;carped away. The attempt was made in three places with great re&s;olution; a few grenadiers got on &s;hore, and form|ed them&s;elves; but as they were not &s;upported, they were for the greater part made pri&s;oners. The re&s;t of the army, after &s;everal very brave and repeated efforts, being wholly unable to force the enemies lines, or make good their land|ing, were obliged to retire with lo&s;s; what added to the di&s;a&s;ter was, that &s;everal of the flat bot|tomed ve&s;&s;els were de&s;troyed or damaged in an hard gale which followed on our retiring from the &s;hore. This made the pro&s;pect of any future attempt more unplea|&s;ing even than the fir&s;t. In this attack we lo&s;t in killed, wounded and pri&s;oners, near five hundred men.</P>
<P>Neither commanders nor &s;ol|diers were however di&s;pirited by this mortifying repul&s;e. They re|&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, not to return without effect, and then determin|ed diligently to &s;earch the whole coa&s;t, in order to find a place more favourable for another at|tack. The view indeed was not encouraging. The i&s;land is na|turally a fortification; and what nature had left undone to make it &s;uch, had been amply &s;upplied by art.</P>
<P>It was a long time after this fir&s;t failure before the weather would give our commanders an opportunity of a &s;econd trial; however they per&s;i&s;ted with the utmo&s;t &s;teadine&s;s, and found at length a convenient &s;ituation. Not that it was a part of the coa&s;t le&s;s &s;trong than the re&s;t; on the con|trary, they built their principal hopes on the exce&s;&s;ive &s;teepne&s;s and difficulty of the rocks, which had rendered the enemy rather le&s;s at|tentive on this quarter. This ar|duous attempt was made at a bold rocky &s;hore, near the above-men|tioned point of Lochmaria. Be|&s;ides the principal attack, two feints were made at the &s;ame time to di|&s;tract the enemy, whil&s;t the men of war directed their fire with great judgment and effect on the hills. The&s;e manoeuvres gave bri|gadier general Lambert with an handful of men, an opportunity of climbing up a very &s;teep rock, without mole&s;tation. This little body having thus pro&s;perou&s;ly gained the top of the hill, form|ed them&s;elves in good order, and without de|lay. <NOTE PLACE="marg">April 25.</NOTE> They were immediately at|tacked by three hundred of the French, but they maintained their advantage with re&s;olution until the whole corps of brigadier Lam|bert, which now had a&s;cended in the &s;ame manner, arrived to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and repul&s;ed the enemy.</P>
<P>The landing of all the forces was made good in a &s;hort time af|ter. The lo&s;s in this daring and &s;ucce&s;sful attempt, was incon&s;i|derable. In one or two places the enemy &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to make &s;ome &s;tand; but the body of light hor&s;e, which was embarked in this expedition, &s;oon drove them to the town, and laid all quite open to the intrenchments before it. The great
<PB N="213" REF="230">
difficulty now con&s;i&s;ted in bringing forward the cannon, which were fir&s;t to be dragged up the rocks, and afterwards, for two leagues, along a very rugged and broken road. This nece&s;&s;arily took up &s;ome time. However the &s;iege was commenced with vigour: and the garri&s;on, commanded by the chevalier de St. Croix, a brave and experienced officer, threatened on their &s;ide a long and ob&s;tinate de|fence. Nothing in fact was defici|ent on either part. The enemy made &s;ome &s;allies; one of them with con&s;iderable effect. Major gen. Crawford was made pri&s;oner on this occa&s;ion. But our troops were only animated by the&s;e checks. A furious attack was made upon the enemies lines which covered the town, and they were carried without much lo&s;s; principally by the uncommon intrepidity of a company of marines which had been but newly rai&s;ed. No action of greater &s;pirit and gallantry had been performed during the whole war.</P>
<P>The town was now entirely a|bandoned, and the defence con|fined to the citadel. It was obvi|ous, that as our fleet prevented all communication with the conti|nent, and thereby cut off all hope of relief, the place mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be reduced; but the chevalier de St. Croix was re&s;olved to provide for his own honour, when he could not for the pre&s;ervation of the place entru&s;ted to him, and, &s;ince he could not maintain it, to &s;ell it as dear as po&s;&s;ible. Ac|cordingly there was no mention of yielding, until the 7th of June, when there was no longer the &s;lighte&s;t pro&s;pect of &s;uccout, and the place was by no means &s;afely tenable. Then he capitulated, and the garri&s;on marched out with the honours of war.</P>
<P>Thus was the i&s;land of Belle|i&s;le reduced under the Engli&s;h government, after a defence of two months. In this expedition we had about eighteen hundred men killed and wounded. The lo&s;s mo&s;t regretted was, that of Sir William Peere Williams, a young gentleman of great talents and ex|pectations, and who had made a di&s;tingui&s;hed figure in parliament. He had but newly entered into the &s;ervice. He was &s;hot in the night, by having carele&s;sly approached too near a centinel of the enemy. He was the third gentleman of fa|&s;hion whom in this war, the love of enterprize had brought to an honourable death in the&s;e expedi|tions to the coa&s;t of France.</P>
<P>Whatever difference of opinion might have been entertained con|cerning the value of this conque&s;t, or the price which was paid for it, the rejoicing in London was great and &s;incere. The general and the land and &s;ea officers employed in the expedition were the &s;ubject of very ju&s;t applau&s;e, who with &s;o no|ble a per&s;everance had &s;truggled with, and had overcome &s;uch great difficulties, and who had the &s;pirit, after &s;uch a di&s;a&s;ter on their out|&s;et, to renew an attack under cir|cum&s;tances nearly as unfavourable as tho&s;e by which they had been at fir&s;t foiled. The city of London addre&s;&s;ed the King on the occa|&s;ion. And it was generally expec|ted that this new proof of our &s;uperiority mu&s;t influence the ne|gotiation in our favour. Some however were of opinion, that it
<PB N="214" REF="231">
would rather exa&s;perate the French, and irritate their pride to renew the&s;e efforts which their misfor|tunes had &s;lackened when they &s;aw us in the mid&s;t of a treaty making attempts, and carrying places in Old France, and as it were, in the pre&s;ence of that haughty court. However as there was nothing done that was not &s;trictly ju&s;tifiable, no complaint was made, and the trea|ty proceeded, to all appearance with as much good humour as before.</P>

Engli&s;h an&s;wer to the French memorial.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that though the courts of London and Ver|&s;ailles treated &s;eparately, it was hi|therto by no means propo&s;ed, that this &s;eparate di&s;cu&s;&s;ion &s;hould lead to a &s;eparate peace. It was no more than a previous arrangement for the removal of tho&s;e difficul|ties, which might prevent the peace of France with England from be|ing united with the general peace of Europe. But in proportion as the treaty advanced, it became obvious, that the &s;ettling of any terms, which had no reference to the &s;ignature of &s;omething obli|gatory between the two crowns, could at be&s;t be only void and illu|&s;ory, and might in the end even prove the &s;ource of dangerous and captious altercations. The Engli&s;h mini&s;ter therefore, before he would agree to that definitively upon any point, and particularly upon the epochas, in&s;i&s;ted upon two preliminary conditions.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, that every thing, which &s;hould be happily adju&s;ted between the two crowns in relation to their particular war, &s;hall be made obliga|tory, final, and conclu&s;ive, indepen|dent of the fate of the negotiation of Aug&s;burg.</P>
<P>Secondly, that the definitive trea|ty of peace between Great Britain and France, or preliminary articles to that end, &s;hall be &s;igned and ra|tified between the date of that me|morial and the fir&s;t of the follow|ing Augu&s;t.</P>
<P>If the&s;e conditions were accept|ed, then England on her part con|&s;ented to name determinate epo|chas, to which the <HI>uti po&s;&s;idetis</HI> &s;hould refer; the fir&s;t of July for Europe; the fir&s;t of September for Africa and America; and the fir&s;t of November for the Ea&s;t Indies. The French mini&s;try without con|te&s;ting the epochas them&s;elves, com|plained of the conditions; of the fir&s;t, becau&s;e they &s;aid it departed from the letter and &s;pirit of the memorial of the 26th of March, which was the foundation of the whole treaty; of the &s;econd, on ac|count of the extreme &s;hortne&s;s of the time allotted for the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of &s;ome difficult and momentous points; and the adju&s;tment of mat|ters which regarded a war extend|ed over the four quarters of the
<PB N="215" REF="232">
globe; for the memorial which contained tho&s;e conditions, was dated on the 17th, and was not received at Paris until the end of June, &s;o that little more than a month was left to obtain the con|&s;ent of the court of Vienna to a &s;eparate treaty, to &s;ettle the terms of this treaty, and finally, to ratify it.</P>
<P>If a very uncommon good under|&s;tanding had not &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between her imperial maje&s;ty and the king of France, it mu&s;t have been very difficult to have received this con|&s;ent. But in fact it was immedi|ately received, and upon one very &s;hort and apparently rea&s;onable con|dition, "That nothing might be &s;tipulated to the prejudice of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria." But when this condition came to be explained, as we &s;hall &s;ee pre&s;ently, it was &s;o far from facilitating, that it created new ob&s;tacles to the peace. How|ever, this acquie&s;cence of the prin|cipal of her allies, enabled France to accept of the fir&s;t condition with|out re&s;erve; and to the la&s;t &s;he ver|bally, though not in the cleare&s;t terms, agreed al&s;o.</P>
<P>Things &s;eemed for the pre&s;ent in the be&s;t &s;ituation, which in this &s;tage of the treaty could be ex|pected. The ba&s;is of the nego|tiation was &s;olidly e&s;tabli&s;hed. The article <HI>uti po&s;&s;idetis,</HI> &s;ince the taking Bellei&s;le, was a matter of le&s;s diffi|culty, and the epochas were in ge|neral &s;ettled in &s;uch a manner, as to coincide with the de&s;igns and de&s;ires of both parties. The treaty was confined to the two powers, and it was to be perfectly definitive as to them. A time for concluding it, was al&s;o in a great mea&s;ure &s;et|tled; a circum&s;tance, which if it did not admit &s;ufficient lei&s;ure for accurate di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, cut off however the opportunities of chicane, and &s;eemed to be the mo&s;t &s;uitable to a candid proceeding, and a &s;incere de&s;ire of peace.</P>
<P>The foundation being thus laid, the &s;uper&s;tructure was the next con|&s;ideration. This &s;uper&s;tructure con|&s;i&s;ted in the adju&s;tment of tho&s;e compen&s;ations which were to be made for the reciprocal conque&s;ts (and here the difficulty lay) of the two powers; a punctilio of honour might have intervened at the very fir&s;t &s;etting out, extremely pernici|ous to the &s;alutary work in hand; from which party the fir&s;t propo&s;ition &s;hould proceed? But in this re&s;pect France gave way, and that conce&s;&s;ion afforded no incon&s;iderable proof of her pacific intentions.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t apprize the reader that we do not mean to enter exactly into the whole detail of this nego|tiation, nor undertake preci&s;ely to de&s;cribe all the turns that were taken in it. This, we imagine, would prove a tedious and unac|ceptable performance. We &s;hall attach our&s;elves to the capital ob|jects which were contended for in this game of policy: We &s;hall en|deavour to point out the matters which fir&s;t ob&s;tructed, and then finally broke off the treaty; and we &s;hall re&s;t on the&s;e things in &s;uch a manner, as &s;eems to us fitte&s;t for marking out the true &s;pirit of the negotiating powers. Our own ob|&s;ervations &s;hall be very &s;paringly interpo&s;ed. We are hi&s;torians, and not advocates.</P>
<P>The <HI>uti po&s;&s;idetis</HI> being &s;ettled as the ba&s;is of the treaty, nothing could rea&s;onably be claimed by either party, that was not to be counterpoi&s;ed by &s;ome equivalent from the other; and con&s;equently
<PB N="216" REF="233">
it was nece&s;&s;ary to adju&s;t and value their &s;everal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, preten&s;ions and demands. There were &s;ix principal objects in this negotia|tion. Fir&s;t, the limits of the two crowns in North America. Se|condly, the conque&s;ts of Great Britain in the We&s;t-Indies, (toge|ther with the Neutral I&s;lands there.) Thirdly, our conque&s;ts in Africa and in India. Fourthly, the ad|ju&s;tment of the particular affair be|tween the Engli&s;h and French in Germany. Fifthly, the conduct which the two crowns were to hold with regard to their re&s;pective al|lies in Germany. And la&s;tly, the re&s;titution of the captures made by England, previous to the declara|tion of war.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t of the&s;e articles, France propo&s;ed to cede and gua|ranty all Canada to England; &s;ti|pulating only that the free and pub|lick exerci&s;e of the Roman Catho|lick religion &s;hould be permitted under the Engli&s;h government, and that tho&s;e of the old French colo|ni&s;ts who cho&s;e to retire might have leave to tran&s;port them&s;elves from thence, and take away or di&s;|po&s;e of their effects. In compen|&s;ation for this, they required a con|firmation of the privilege of what fi&s;hing they enjoyed on the coa&s;t of Newfoundland, under the treaty of Utrecht; and that this fi&s;hery might be carried on with advantage, they likewi&s;e required the re&s;titution of the i&s;le of Cape Breton, excluding them&s;elves in return from erecting on that i&s;land any kind of fortifica|tion what&s;oever.</P>
<P>The affairs in the we&s;t Indies, which makes the &s;econd capital ob|ject, they propo&s;ed to &s;ettle in this manner. They offered to exchange Minorca for Guadaloupe and Mari|galante; and as to the four Neu|tral I&s;lands, they in&s;i&s;ted that two of them, Dominica and St. Vincent, were held by their natural inhabi|tants the Carribees, under the pro|tection of France, and that they ought &s;till to remain in the &s;ame condition. With regard to the two others, they propo&s;ed to make a fair divi&s;ion; that St. Lucia &s;hould remain to France, and that England &s;hould enter into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Tobago. On this head it is &s;uf|ficient to ob&s;erve, that in the opi|nion of &s;ome people, our mini&s;try did not, in this treaty, &s;et the ju&s;t value on the acqui&s;ition they had made; when they looked upon Canada as the great and leading object, and only con&s;idered Guada|loupe and Marigalante in a &s;econ|dary and &s;ubordinate light. This is a que&s;tion of difficulty, and has been much agitated. Tho&s;e who dread a fre&s;h American war from the ambition of France, and were &s;truck with the idea of extended empire, preferred the former con|que&s;t; tho&s;e who &s;olely con&s;idered our intere&s;t as a commercial peo|ple, were generally in favour of the latter.</P>
<P>On the &s;ide of Africa, France &s;atisfied her&s;elf with demanding either the &s;ettlement at Senegal, or the i&s;le of Goree: for which (to|gether with the re&s;toration of Belle|i&s;le) they con&s;ented to evacuate Gottingen, He&s;&s;e and Hanau, and to draw off their army to the Maine and the Rhine. This was certain|ly a full equivalent. But with regard to the Ea&s;t Indies, they had no tolerable equivalent to offer. They expatiated much in their memorial upon the di&s;advantages which mu&s;t ari&s;e to the companies of the two nations, from their entertaining
<PB N="217" REF="234">
views of conque&s;t, &s;o contrary to the true &s;pirit, and the real intere&s;t of the&s;e trading e&s;tabli&s;hments; and they concluded by propo&s;ing the treaty, formerly &s;ettled between the fieurs Godcheau and Saunders, as a ba&s;is for the re|e&s;tabli&s;hment of peace in A&s;ia. It mu&s;t be re|marked, that this treaty had been concluded at a time when the affairs of France in the Ea&s;t Indies made a figure very different from their pre&s;ent &s;ituation; and therefore it &s;eemed unfair to make this treaty a &s;tandard under circum&s;tances al|together inapplicable.</P>
<P>The war, which has been &s;o long, with &s;o much blood&s;hed and &s;o fruitle&s;ly carried on in We&s;tpha|lia, the French &s;trenuou&s;ly contend|ed, was from the time of (what they called) the breach of capitula|tion of Clo&s;ter-Seven, a war pure|ly Engli&s;h; and therefore that their conque&s;ts in that part of Germany, formed a proper compen&s;ation for the Engli&s;h conque&s;ts in the other quarters of the world. Our mini|&s;ters did not attempt formally to refute this a&s;&s;ertion; they rather &s;eemed to admit it; and they agreed accordingly to receive the evacuation of the&s;e places as an equivalent for ce&s;&s;ions to be made on the footing we have already mentioned. On this point there was little difficulty.</P>
<P>The intricate and knotty part was on what we have &s;tated as the fifth object; the conduct of the two crowns with regard to their allies. Here was a real, a capital difficulty. From the beginning of the negotia|tion, England had declared that they would inviolably pre&s;erve their faith to the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, and would act &s;trenuou&s;ly in his &s;upport. This picqued the French mini&s;ters; who, in their turn, thought them|&s;elves bound to make a declaration equally &s;trong in favour of the em|pre&s;s; and they had, moreover, re|cently conditioned with the court of Vienna, to admit nothing in the treaty to her di&s;advantage; words of great latitude. However, in this difficulty, they found out a &s;olution, which it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed, had a very fair and capti|vating appearance. They propo&s;ed that both armies in Germany &s;hould ob&s;erve an exact neutrality; and &s;hould be reciprocally bound to af|ford no &s;ort of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, nor to give no &s;ort of offence to the allies of either of the parties. And they propo&s;ed further, that as armies in this &s;tate of inert neutrality mu&s;t be a dead and u&s;ele&s;s expence to the power who maintains them, the French king, from the time his Britannic maje&s;ty recalled the Eng|li&s;h forces from Germany, would cau&s;e double the number of French forces from the armies of the Up|per and Lower Rhine to return in|to France; and that no French troops &s;hould remain in Germany but in proportion to tho&s;e which the king of England &s;hould keep in his pay. It might certainly be urged in confirmation of the pro|priety of this offer, that in reality the&s;e armies, whil&s;t they continued in action, though they worried each other abundantly, afforded no kind of a&s;&s;i&s;tance to their allies, and therefore, when they came mutual|ly to entertain pacific &s;entiments concerning their own particular quarrel, and were to give an ex|ample of moderation to the re&s;t of Europe, there &s;eemed to be no rea&s;on why they &s;hould make ef|forts in favour of any ally which they had not made, or been able to
<PB N="218" REF="235">
make in the hotte&s;t time of ho&s;ti|lity.</P>
<P>The la&s;t article had its difficulties al&s;o. The French in&s;i&s;ted, as a point from which they were re|&s;olved never to recede, upon the re&s;titution of the captures made be|fore the declaration of war. This demand, they were of opinion, was grounded on the cleare&s;t principles of the law of nations, and the mo&s;t expre&s;s &s;tipulation of treaties. With|out entering into the&s;e various ar|guments with which this po&s;ition might be maintained and attacked, it appeared to many that the ho|nour of both nations was almo&s;t equally concerned, the one to claim, the other as re&s;olutely to refu&s;e this re&s;titution.</P>
<P>On the whole, the&s;e propo&s;als, which the French &s;ent to London in a memorial of the 15th of July, formed, though in &s;ome re&s;pects undoubtedly exceptionable, a very agreeable plan for a treaty of peace. A better could not have been ex|pected in the fir&s;t project of an ene|my, and it might be hoped, that a negotiation thus favourably be|gun, could not fail of adju&s;ting ea&s;ily whatever appeared wrong, or &s;upplying whatever was defective in this fir&s;t draught of the propo&s;itions. But fatally for the repo&s;e of man|kind, in the very in&s;tant that this fair propo&s;al was made, at the very moment when the&s;e &s;trong demon|&s;trations were given, an act was done which blew up at one explo|&s;ion, the whole ba&s;is of the treaty that had been long and carefully laying, &s;cattered the materials which had been &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly collected, and &s;o cautiou&s;ly arranged, and in|&s;tead of extingui&s;hing, &s;pread the flames of war more widely, and made them rage with new fury. From this time forward all the tran&s;action was full of animo&s;ity, re&s;entment and mi&s;tru&s;t. The rea|der has been apprized of the mea|&s;ures which France had been inva|riably pur&s;uing at the court of Ma|drid, and the arguments &s;he em|ployed to infu&s;e a jealou&s;y into that court. Hitherto however, there was no appearance that the&s;e mea|&s;ures had any effect; but to the infi|nite &s;urprize and indignation of the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter, together with the memorial which contained the above recited propo&s;itions, Mr. Bu&s;&s;y, the French agent, delivered a private memorial, &s;ignifying, that in order to e&s;tabli&s;h the peace upon &s;olid foundations, not to be &s;haken by the conte&s;ted intere&s;ts of a third power, the king of Spain might be invited to accede to guaranty the treaty, and that to prevent the differences which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between Great Britain and this monarchy from being a means of producing a fre&s;h war in Europe, with the con|&s;ent and communication of his Ca|tholic maje&s;ty, he propo&s;es, that in this negotiation, the three points which had been di&s;puted between the crowns of England and Spain, might be finally &s;ettled. Fir&s;t, the re&s;titution of &s;ome captures made upon the Spani&s;h flag. Secondly, the privilege of the Spani&s;h nation to fi&s;h on the banks of Newfound|land. Thirdly, the demolition of the Engli&s;h &s;ettlements made on the Spani&s;h territories in the bay of Honduras.</P>
<P>It may be ea&s;ily imagined, from the character of the then &s;ecretary of &s;tate, in what manner he receiv|ed the&s;e propo&s;als: he rejected with the utmo&s;t &s;corn, the offer of nego|tiating, through an enemy humbled, and almo&s;t at his feet, the di&s;putes
<PB N="219" REF="236">
of his nation, with a power ac|tually in friend&s;hip with us. He called upon the Spani&s;h mini&s;ter to di&s;avow the propo&s;itions, which had been &s;aid to be made with the know|ledge of his court. He returned as wholly inadmi&s;&s;ible this offen&s;ive memorial, declaring, that it would be looked upon as an affront to the dignity of his ma&s;ter, and incompa|tible with the &s;incerity of the nego|tiation, to make any further men|tion of &s;uch a circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>And now he prepared, without delay, an an&s;wer to the principal memorial, in a &s;tile rather dictated by the circum&s;tances which accom|panied that paper, and which &s;uf|ficiently indicated the de&s;igns of France, than what the propo&s;itions them&s;elves &s;trictly de&s;erved. In|deed, as he had by this time con|ceived an incurable &s;u&s;picion of the &s;incerity of France in the whole proceeding, it would not have been prudent to have made tho&s;e ad|vances, which on a &s;uppo&s;ition of good faith and pacific intentions, might po&s;&s;ibly have been advi&s;e|able; for though both powers had over and over declared, that their re&s;pective propo&s;itions, if the treaty &s;hould by any accident be broken off, would be con&s;idered as re|tracted or never made; yet it is certain, that things once &s;ettled and agreed to, unavoidably &s;tamp their own impre&s;&s;ion upon any future negotiation, relative to the &s;ame &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Mr. Pitt's an&s;wer, which is dated on the 29th of July, agrees to the re&s;titution of Guadaloupe, Marigalante and Bellei&s;le, on the compen&s;ations propo&s;ed by France. It agrees al&s;o to receive Canada, but without any new limits or any exception what&s;oever; and it adds to the French offer of all Canada, "its appurtenances." It admits the propo&s;al of the partition of the Neutral I&s;lands. It rejects the French demand of Cape Breton, or of any other i&s;land in the gulph or river of St. Lawrence; or of any power of fi&s;hing in that river, in that gulph, or on tho&s;e coa&s;ts; and it allows the privilege of fi&s;hing on the banks of Newfoundland, only on con&s;ideration of the demolition of Dunkirk. But the propo&s;ed re|&s;titution either of Senegal or Goree is utterly refu&s;ed. The German neutrality is rejected with di&s;dain; and it is declared that Great Britain is unalterably re&s;olved to &s;upport the king of Pru&s;&s;ia with efficacy and good faith. In addition to the of|fer made to evacuate He&s;&s;e, &amp;c. it is in&s;i&s;ted that the French &s;hall make a general evacuation of all her conque&s;ts in We&s;tphalia, and all its countries, including its con|que&s;ts from the king of Pru&s;&s;ia on the Rhine, though France had be|fore declared, that they were con|quered for the queen of Hungary, that they were actually governed in her name, and that &s;he could not, con&s;i&s;tently with good faith, agree to deliver them to the king of Pru&s;&s;ia. The treaty between Saunders and Godcheau was not admitted as a proper ba&s;is for a treaty relative to the Ea&s;t Indies. But it was agreed, that the two companies &s;hould negotiate con|cerning their re&s;pective intere&s;ts, as the king of Great Britain could not di&s;po&s;e of the rights of the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t India company with|out their con&s;ent. As to the re&s;ti|tution of the captures before the war, this was mo&s;t po&s;itively re|fu&s;ed.</P>
<P>In this period we leave the ne|gotiation
<PB N="220" REF="237">
to follow the motions of the armies in Germany. It is cer|tain, that the di&s;po&s;itions of the two courts grew daily more unfa|vourable: their confidence in each other, and their mutual good-will wore away; and it was to be fear|ed, that this negotiation, if it broke off in an un&s;atisfactory manner, mu&s;t leave impre&s;&s;ions on the minds of the two nations of &s;uch a nature, as might cau&s;e them to wi&s;h they had never en|gaged in it.</P>

<P>ALthough the great purpo&s;e of the early and &s;trenuous effort made by the allies was not fully an&s;wered, it neverthele&s;s produced, as we have before ob&s;erved, a very con&s;iderable and u&s;eful effect. The de&s;truction of the French magazines retarded their operation in &s;uch a manner, that the greate&s;t part of the month of June was &s;pent be|fore their armies found them&s;elves in a condition to act. But as &s;oon as they had taken proper mea&s;ures for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, the prince of Soubi&s;e cau&s;ed his troops to pa&s;s the Rhine, and to advance on the &s;ide of Mun&s;ter, not far from which city the hereditary prince of Brun&s;|wick was po&s;ted to oppo&s;e him. Mar&s;hal Broglio a&s;&s;embled the forces under his command at Ca&s;&s;el, and moved towards the Dymel, in or|der to effect a junction with the body under the prince of Soubi&s;e. They made no doubt that their conjoined &s;trength would &s;oon at|tain a decided &s;uperiority over the allies, who had ended their late enterprize with a lo&s;s which was con&s;iderable, and which in their circum&s;tances, they could not well bear, nor ea&s;ily &s;upply.</P>
<P>The&s;e hopes were &s;upported by the &s;ucce&s;s of their fir&s;t encounter. General Sporcken with a &s;trong de|tachment had been po&s;ted in an ad|vantageous &s;ituation on the Dymel, and in the front of the allied army. On the approach of Mar&s;hal Broglio, he attempted to retire with all that expedition which hsi infe|riority made nece&s;&s;ary. But the French came upon him with &s;uch rapidity, that <NOTE PLACE="marg">29th June.</NOTE> they overtook and attacked his rear, which was in&s;tantly routed; they took eight hundred pri&s;oners, nineteen pieces of cannon, four hundred hor&s;es, and upwards of an hundred and &s;eventy waggons. The &s;ame day they pa&s;&s;ed the Dy|mel; and whil&s;t prince Ferdinand, di&s;couraged by this check, fell back to the Lippe, they made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of War|burg, <NOTE PLACE="marg">2d July.</NOTE> Dringleburg, and Paderborn.</P>
<P>The allies, however, &s;oon reco|vered their &s;pirits; and the main
<PB N="221" REF="238">
body of their army being well &s;e|cured, they &s;ent out &s;everal detach|ments. Their &s;mall bodies were conducted by general Luckner, and other able partizans, who under|took &s;everal bold and very di&s;tant enterprizes, attacked the enemy where they were lea&s;t upon their guard, routed their convoys, de|&s;troyed &s;everal of their magazines, carriages and hor&s;es, and carried off their prey even from the gates of Ca&s;&s;el. The&s;e lively actions &s;eemed a prelude to &s;ome more im|portant and deci&s;ive attempt.</P>
<P>The French became &s;en&s;ible that a &s;troke of &s;ome importance was expected from the greatne&s;s of their force, and that it was not for the credit of their arms only, but for their &s;ecurity from the minute, but continual and galling attempts of parties from the allied army.</P>
<P>For &s;ome time prince Ferdinand had been po&s;ted to the &s;outh of the Lippe, between Ham and Lip&s;tadt. This po&s;ition he took, in all pro|bability, becau&s;e M. Broglio had, by occupying the places on the Dy|mel, got between him and Hano|ver. Therefore he judged it expe|dient for him in his turn to get be|tween the prince de Soubi&s;e and the Rhine. In this &s;ituation, if the enemy attempted any movement to|wards the king's dominions, he was ready to fall directly on the places they occupied by that river, which, in the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, were full as important to them as the Hanoverian territory was to us. Thus whil&s;t he &s;eemed to retire from that territory, and in a man|ner to abandon it, he in reality provided with the greater effect for its &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>Mar&s;hal Broglio, when he had re&s;olved on the attack of the allied army, united his troops to tho&s;e of the prince de Soubi&s;e, at a place called Soe&s;t, between Lip&s;tadt and Ham. On the other hand, as &s;oon as the general of the allies was ap|prized of their intention he po&s;ted his army in a very &s;trong and ad|vantageous manner.</P>
<P>The river Ae&s;t runs for a con&s;i|derable way, almo&s;t parallel to the Lippe, from which it is not di&s;tant in &s;ome places, much more than half a mile. The high road from Lip|&s;tadt to Ham pa&s;&s;es between the&s;e rivers; and it was of the utmo&s;t moment to prince Ferdinand to &s;e|cure that important communication, by which alone he could hope an advantageous retreat, or in any de|gree propo&s;e to command the ad|jacent country. With a view there|fore to protect that communica|tion, he e&s;tabli&s;hed his left wing on the I&s;thmus between the rivers. The left extremity of that wing under general Wutgenau, leaning to the Lippe, by which it was per|fectly &s;ecured, as the right was &s;upported by the village of Kirch Denkern, &s;ituated immediately on the Ae&s;t. The marquis of Granby commanded in that wing, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of lieutenant gen. Howard and the prince of Anhalt, who were po&s;ted towards the above-mention|ed village.</P>
<P>At that village, another river cal|led the Saltzbach, &s;mall, but very deep, joins the Ae&s;t almo&s;t in a right angle. Behind this river on a con&s;iderable eminence was placed the centre, commanded by general Conway; and on a con|tinuation of the &s;ame eminence, the right wing, under the here|ditary prince, &s;tretched out to|wards the village of Werle, and it was well defended on the flank by
<PB N="222" REF="239">
rugged, bu&s;hy, and almo&s;t imprac|ticable ground. Nothing could be more advantageous than this di&s;|po&s;ition of the army, by which the whole centre and right wing were covered in front by a river, and the left &s;upported by rivers on both its flanks. In the left indeed, was the &s;trength and flower of the army; the count of Lippe had placed al&s;o in this wing, the greate&s;t part of the artillery, as he knew that it defended the mo&s;t important &s;itua|tion, was the mo&s;t expo&s;ed in front, and con&s;equently would be the ob|ject of the enemy's mo&s;t con&s;ider|able efforts.</P>
<P>He was not mi&s;taken in his con|jecture. On the 15th of July, in the evening, a very furious attack was made on lord Granby's po&s;ts, which was &s;u&s;tained for a long time with all the intrepidity and firmne&s;s, which Briti&s;h troops always exert, and which that gallant officer knows &s;o well how to in&s;pire. The di&s;po&s;ition we have ju&s;t mentioned, was not then compleated; &s;o that they had the whole torrent of that impetuo&s;ity, which di&s;tingui&s;hes the French in their fir&s;t attacks, to re|&s;i&s;t for &s;ome hours, until Wutgenau, according to the plan originally projected, arrived to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and then with efforts united and redoubled in a long and ob&s;tinate combat, which continued until it was quite dark, they repul&s;ed the French, and drove them into the woods.</P>
<P>By the next morning, the di&s;po&s;ition of the al|lies <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 16th.</NOTE> was perfected; and it was evi|dent that the French, far from be|ing di&s;mayed by their misfortune, were preparing for a more general and better &s;u&s;tained attack than the former. M. Broglio commanded again&s;t our left, which, as on the preceding day, was the principal object of the enemy. The prince de Soubi&s;e led their centre and their left. The engagement began at three in the morning, and it was a &s;evere and continued fire for up|wards of five hours, before the lea&s;t effect could be perceived on either &s;ide. The weight of the attack this day lay on Wutgenau's corps, which &s;upported it with a degree of bravery, that rivalled the &s;tand which had been lately made by the Briti&s;h forces. But about nine, the prince di&s;covered that the enemy were preparing to erect batteries on an eminence, in the front of the marquis of Granby's camp, which he had not been able to enclo&s;e within his lines. Sen&s;ible of the pre&s;&s;ing nece&s;&s;ity there was of pre|venting the enemy from &s;eizing on an eminence, from whence they might cruelly gall his army, he called in a re&s;erve, which had been placed at the other &s;ide of the Lippe under general Sporcken. Strength|ened by this &s;upply, and encouraged by the irre&s;olution which now be|gan to appear in the motions of the enemy, he commanded the troops which were neare&s;t at hand to ad|vance upon them.</P>
<P>This movement was deci&s;ive, the enemy gave way, fell into di&s;or|der, and retired with precipitation. Their centre and left, which had not been able to pa&s;s the Saltzbach, after a long and ineffectual can|nonade, retired with the re&s;t, and covered their retreat; &s;o that fa|voured by this circum&s;tance, and the clo&s;ene&s;s of the country, which was full of hedges, they marched off in tolerable order, and were pur&s;ued but a little way. How|ever, their lo&s;s was con&s;iderable:
<PB N="223" REF="240">
the regiment of Rouge, con&s;i&s;ting of four battalions, with its cannon and colours, was entirely taken by the &s;ingle battalion of Maxwell. Their whole lo&s;s in killed, wound|ed, and pri&s;oners, has been e&s;ti|mated at five thou&s;and. The allies had about three hundred killed, a thou&s;and wounded, and about two hundred pri&s;oners. This action was the climax of the campaign of 1761, in We&s;tphalia; it did the greate&s;t honour to the wi&s;dom of the accompli&s;hed commander in the di&s;po&s;ition, and to the bravery of the troops in the combat; but it was far from deci&s;ive. Notwith&s;tanding the lo&s;s the French &s;uffered, they were &s;till much &s;uperior, in their numbers. On this misfortune the old ill under&s;tanding between Sou|bi&s;e and Broglio broke out with fre&s;h animo&s;ity. Narratives, me|morials, and replies, conceived with great bitterne&s;s, were mutually re|mitted from both mar&s;hals to their court. Mar&s;hal Broglio alledged, that his misfortune was owing to the prince de Soubi&s;e's delay, who did not begin the attack till it was too late for him to continue it; the prince de Soubi&s;e, on the other hand, &s;ugge&s;ted, that Broglio be|gan his attack earlier than the time that had been fixed, in hopes of forcing the allies without Sou|bi&s;e's a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and when he found that point lo&s;t, obliged Soubi&s;e to retreat, that he might not have the honour of recovering it.</P>
<P>The allies after this battle kept their ground for &s;ome time, whil&s;t the French retreated. It is impo&s;|&s;ible regularly to account for all the unexpected turns which have happened, perhaps, more in this campaign, than in any of the for|mer. It is enough to know that the original &s;uperiority of the French, together with their oppor|tunity of continual reinforcement, may very tolerably explain the rea|&s;on of the advantages which they &s;o often obtained after very con&s;i|derable defeats. This is a point which it is nece&s;&s;ary the reader &s;hould continually keep in his mind during the whole narration of this &s;trange war. After their late lo&s;s and retreat, the French &s;oon ad|vanced again. The party under the prince de Soubi&s;e pa&s;&s;ed the Lippe, and made di&s;po&s;itions for the &s;iege of Mun&s;ter, whil&s;t mar&s;hal Broglio's army turned off on the other &s;ide, cro&s;&s;ed the We&s;er, and threatened to fall in upon Hanover.</P>
<P>This divi&s;ion of the enemy com|pelled prince Ferdinand, though little in a condition for it, to di|vide his army al&s;o. The heredita|ry prince po&s;ted him&s;elf to cover Mun&s;ter; whil&s;t prince Ferdinand continued in the country towards the We&s;er, to ob&s;erve the motions of mar&s;hal Broglio.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e various po&s;itions were mutually taken, as the armies were continually moving near each other, a number of very &s;harp &s;kir|mi&s;hes en&s;ued. Mar&s;hal Broglio cautiou&s;ly avoided a battle when|ever he &s;aw that the duke of Brun&s;|wick, by calling together his troops, had prepared for, and was de|&s;irous of it; &s;o that there was no way left, but if po&s;&s;ible, to check his motions, and wear down his force, by reiterated le&s;&s;er actions. The&s;e actions were almo&s;t always to the advantage of our troops. In one of them however, the young prince Henry of Brun&s;wick was mortally wounded; and the whole army &s;aw with <NOTE PLACE="marg">July 20th.</NOTE> regret, the di&s;appointment of &s;uch
<PB N="224" REF="241">
great hopes as were formed from the ri&s;ing gallantry of a prince, who &s;o nobly &s;upported the martial &s;pirit of his family, and had fallen whil&s;t he was emulating the heroic actions of his brother the hereditary prince and his uncle Ferdinand.</P>
<P>On the &s;ide of We&s;tphalia, the prince de Soubi&s;e per&s;evered, not|with&s;tanding &s;ome checks, in his de&s;ign of laying &s;iege to Mun&s;ter; there was great rea&s;on to apprehend that he might &s;ucceed in that en|terprize, as it was always in mar&s;hal Broglio's power, by taking &s;ome &s;teps on the &s;ide of Hanover, to make it nece&s;&s;ary to draw away the greate&s;t part of the force de&s;tined to the &s;uccour of Mun&s;ter. He therefore began to make the pre|vious arrangements at Dor&s;ten. The hereditary prince, who knew that he was continually liable to be called off, took the fir&s;t opportunity of attacking this place. A battalion of French <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 30.</NOTE> troops formed its garri&s;on, and made a brave defence, but it was a&s;&s;aulted with &s;o much re&s;olution and per&s;everance, that they were obliged to &s;urrender pri&s;oners of war. The prince totally de&s;troyed the ovens which were e&s;tabli&s;hed here, and by this means not only fru&s;trated their de&s;ign of be&s;ieging Mun&s;ter, but compelled them for a time, to retire from the Lippe.</P>
<P>As to prince Ferdinand, he &s;aw clearly, that the intentions of mar|&s;hal Broglio were to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of his maje&s;ty's, and the duke of Brun&s;wick's territories. To attempt to follow him, and to beat him from thence, would only be irrecoverably to transfer the &s;eat of war into tho&s;e countries, and whol|ly to abandon We&s;tphalia to the enemy. Diver&s;ion therefore, and not direct oppo&s;ition, became his object. He re&s;olved, that as often as he perceived Mar&s;hal Broglio's making any progre&s;s on the &s;u&s;pected quarter, he &s;hould throw him&s;elf as far into He&s;&s;e as the enemy had advanced towards Hanover, and by &s;topping their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, oblige them to quit their enterprize. This plan at fir&s;t &s;ucceeded to his wi&s;hes, and drew back mar&s;hal Broglio into He&s;&s;e, upon who&s;e approach prince Ferdi|nand retired to his old quarters at Paderborn, and was ready for a new movement as <NOTE PLACE="marg">19th Oct.</NOTE> &s;oon as Broglio &s;hould return to the execution of his former de&s;ign.</P>
<P>Accordingly he &s;oon returned to the We&s;er. Then the hereditary prince, who had by this time re|joined the grand army, advanced into He&s;&s;e, and pu&s;hed to the far|the&s;t extremities of that country, even as far as Fritzlar; but though he &s;ucceeded &s;o far in his attempts as to de&s;troy all the le&s;&s;er magazines which he found in the open coun|try; yet as all the fortre&s;&s;es were in the hands of the enemy, as the garri&s;ons had been newly reinforced and the grand magazines were well &s;ecured in tho&s;e places, he kept his ground in his advanced po|&s;ition.</P>
<P>It was on this occa&s;ion principal|ly that prince Ferdinand found the di&s;advantage of not being able to form two armies, which might act &s;eparately. For on one hand, mar|&s;hal Broglio, when he had perfectly &s;ecured his po&s;ts in He&s;&s;e, took a &s;ituation in which he watched all the motions of prince Ferdinand, and kept him&s;elf in readine&s;s to fall back into He&s;&s;e, or to advance into Hanover, as might be&s;t agree with his de&s;igns. From hence he
<PB N="225" REF="242">
&s;ent out &s;ome powerful detachments which acted with great effect One of the&s;e detachments entered the Harts Fore&s;t (the remains of the great Hercynian, &s;o famous among the antients) and be&s;ieged the &s;trong ca&s;tle of Schartsfelts, which they took and demoli&s;hed. Then they laid the whole tract of country under &s;evere contribution. Ano|ther, and &s;till more powerful de|tachment under prince Xavier of Saxony appeared before Wolfen|buttel, a con&s;iderable city, and &s;trongly &s;ituated, as it is wholly &s;urrounded by <NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 5th.</NOTE> the Ocker. But the French, as they knew that the town is mo&s;tly built of wood, commenced their operations with a very fierce bom|bardment. This had &s;uch an effect, that the re&s;i&s;tance of the place was not proportioned to its &s;trength; in five days it &s;urrendered, and was &s;ubject, like the re&s;t, to a grievous contribution.</P>
<P>Flu&s;hed with this &s;ucce&s;s, the French followed their blow, and advanced, keeping &s;till the cour&s;e of the Ocker, to Brun&s;wick; and began al&s;o to inve&s;t that city. The reigning prince, unable to protect his &s;ubjects, or to &s;ecure his per&s;on in his dominions, fled to Hamburgh, where he met the landgrave of He&s;&s;e, whom the rage of war had in the &s;ame manner driven from his territories. This free city now be|came a place of general refuge, and enriched it&s;elf by the calamities, as it had in better times done by the pro&s;perity of Germany. It was lately computed, that the &s;trangers there had increa&s;ed to forty thou|&s;and, among&s;t whom they could reckon two &s;overeign princes, and &s;everal other per&s;ons of the fir&s;t di|&s;tinction.</P>
<P>This rapid and unre&s;i&s;ted pro|gre&s;s of the French to the ea&s;tward of the We&s;er, was to the highe&s;t degree alarming. Prince Ferdinand with all the expedition in his power, detached the hereditary prince to the relief of Brun&s;wick. This mea&s;ure fortunately &s;aved that very important place. This active commander compelled the enemy not only to rai&s;e the &s;iege of Brun&s;|wick, but to abandon Wolfenbuttel, and to make a precipitate retreat with the lo&s;s of &s;ome of their can|non, and upwards of a thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t Broglio's detachments proceeded thus in di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the country to the ea&s;tward of the We&s;er, the prince of Soubi&s;e, who by the removal of the hereditary prince of Brun&s;wick to another quarter, &s;aw no longer any thing capable of oppo&s;ing him, &s;pread his army by detachments over all We&s;tphalia, and ravaged it in the mo&s;t cruel manner. They took O&s;nabrug; and becau&s;e the contri|butions were not immediately paid, they gave up the place to be pil|laged by their troops, who rifled the mi&s;erable inhabitants without mercy. Another body pu&s;hed as far as Embden. This important town was immediately &s;urrendered by the garri&s;on (two Engli&s;h com|panies of invalids) at the de&s;ire of the timid inhabitants, and the pro|mi&s;e of favourable treatment: not|with&s;tanding this capitulation, and the merit of &s;o ea&s;y a &s;urrender, the town, as well as the whole country of Ea&s;t-Frie&s;land, was laid under a ruinous contribution. But their ex|orbitances grew to &s;uch an ex|tremity, that the boors were at length compelled to ri&s;e, and with
<PB N="226" REF="243">
&s;uch arms as a &s;udden rage &s;upplied them, to drive the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ors out of their country.</P>
<P>A more con&s;iderable corps com|manded by the prince de Conde, laid &s;iege to Meppen, a place on the Ems, of &s;ome <NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 3d.</NOTE> con&s;equence, and where we had &s;ome magazines. In three days it was reduced, and the garri&s;on of five hundred men were made pri|&s;oners of war.</P>
<P>The city of Bremen was defended by a weak garri&s;on. This was a place of far greater moment than Mep|pen, the allies having ama&s;&s;ed there immen&s;e magazines, as it was a great and trading town, advan|tageou&s;ly &s;ituated on the river We|&s;er; and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this place mu&s;t undoubtedly have given to the French the command of that river, through which the allies derived all their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. If the Engli&s;h had lo&s;t Bremen, they mu&s;t have &s;een them&s;elves inve&s;ted and locked up in a barren country, in the heart of Germany, &s;urrounded by their ene|mies, and deprived of every re|&s;ource. Fortunately the inhabi|tants of this city proved as brave as tho&s;e of Embden were timid. They were exa&s;perated by the ex|ample of the French rigour, which they had &s;een on every &s;ide of them. They therefore joined the garri&s;on, in&s;tead of di&s;couraging them in the defence of the place. The French were obliged to retire precipitately; and a &s;trong reinforcement was thrown into Bremen, to &s;ecure that very important city from the like enterprizes for the future.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the two French armies in this manner ravaged all the country held by the allies, prince Ferdinand, who &s;aw the rage of war &s;pread all around him, with his u&s;ual firmne&s;s, kept that central po&s;ition which he had taken &s;oon after the battle of Kirch Denkern; no movements of the enemy could terrify or allure him from it. He had &s;ettled his head quarters at Buhne, and his army extended from thence towards Hammelen. Po&s;ted in this manner, he &s;ecured the cour&s;e of the We&s;er, by preventing the enemy from making them&s;elves ma&s;ters either of Hammelen or Minden; he lay in the be&s;t &s;ituation in which it was po&s;&s;ible to place a &s;ingle army, that was to act again&s;t two; and know|ing that he could not follow their movements with the body of his army, without hazarding the king's electoral dominions, and indeed every object of the war, he con|tended him&s;elf with &s;ending out &s;uch detachments as he could &s;pare, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to the relief of the places which were attacked. He &s;aw that the winter approached, which had always been a circum|&s;tance favourable to him; and it was evident that whil&s;t he continued with his main body immoveably fixed as it was, and his detachments active on every &s;ide, it was im|po&s;&s;ible for the enemy to keep any of tho&s;e places, they had &s;eized in their incur&s;ions.</P>

<P>UNTIL this year the opera|tions of the Pru&s;&s;ian armies took the lead in intere&s;t and import|ance before all the other events of the war. The firmne&s;s and acti|vity of their illu&s;trious monarch, the number and animo&s;ity of his enemies, the blows that he gave, and tho&s;e that he &s;uffered, his di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing and terrible falls, his amaz|ing and almo&s;t miraculous recove|ries, kept all eyes fixed on his moti|ons, as the great centre of public at|tention. Undoubtedly nothing that has ever been acted on the &s;cene of human affairs, attracted the minds of men to it with greater ju&s;tice; none perhaps afforded at once more entertainment to the imagination, and furni&s;hed more copious mate|rials for political and military in|&s;truction; and probably, therefore, this part of all our modern hi&s;tory, will be the mo&s;t carefully &s;tudied by po&s;terity, when it comes to be pro|perly known, and worthily written.</P>
<P>To judge of the importance of this branch of the general war, it will be proper to recollect that, be|&s;ides a number of &s;ieges which were pro&s;ecuted, together with innume|rable and bloody &s;kirmi&s;hes, no le&s;s than nineteen pitched battles, or capital actions, have been &s;ought on his part &s;ince the clo&s;e of the year 1756, when the king of Pru&s;&s;ia fir&s;t &s;eized upon Saxony, and made an irruption into Bohemia. In eleven of the&s;e battles, the King or his generals were defeated. He was victorious only in eight. Ten of them were fought under his own command; and &s;even out of the eight victories which were gained, were obtained by him&s;elf in per&s;on; of the eleven defeats, he was pre&s;ent only at three.</P>
<P>From the&s;e circum&s;tances &s;ome judgment may be formed of the ac|tive and enterprizing character of this monarch, and of the amazing re&s;ource he had prepared, or form|ed, or &s;eized, and in &s;ome in&s;tances, one may &s;ay, almo&s;t created. We have ob&s;erved that the la&s;t campaign had ended more to his advantage, than the one preceding had done; for tho&s;e two great victories of Lig|nitz, and Torgau, with which he then ended his operations, had not only re&s;cued his affairs in Sile&s;ia and Saxony from impending de&s;truction, but had enlarged his field for re|cruiting, and prepared him, to all appearance, for more early and vi|gorous action, than could have been expected in mo&s;t of the preceding campaigns. But every one was &s;urprized to ob&s;erve, that this year he had totally altered the &s;y&s;tem of his conduct. An inactivity and languor was diffu&s;ed over all his proceedings. He &s;eemed to have adopted the caution and &s;lowne&s;s which had been &s;o long oppo&s;ed to
<PB N="228" REF="245">
his vivacity by M. Daun. The &s;ummer was almo&s;t wholly &s;pent, and the King of Pru&s;&s;ia had &s;carce|ly been mentioned.</P>
<P>It was not &s;u&s;pected that the pro|po&s;ed negotiation at Aug&s;burg could have had much, if any influence up|on his method of proceeding. No particular propo&s;als had been made concerning his affairs, nor indeed any other marks of a pacific di&s;po|&s;ition towards him &s;hewn, except what were contained in tho&s;e ge|neral declarations, which a regard to common decency had exacted. It mu&s;t have added to the anx|iety of his &s;ituation, that Great Britain and France were at that time engaged in a &s;eparate treaty, in which the latter power was in a condition to make &s;o many flat|tering offers in relation to Germa|ny, that he might well have dread|ed the withdrawing of that a&s;&s;i&s;tance which had hitherto been his great &s;upport again&s;t all attacks, and his final re&s;ource in all his di&s;tre&s;&s;es. Perhaps he was well a&s;&s;ured, that the faith of Great Britain was proof again&s;t every offer, however allur|ing; in fact it proved to be &s;o; for in rejecting the German neutrality, which the French propo&s;ed in the late negotiation, our country af|forded as convincing a proof of an un&s;hakeable public faith, as any people had ever given to their allies.</P>
<P>However, whil&s;t this point re|mained in any degree of &s;u&s;pence, it would have appeared natural, that the King of Pru&s;&s;ia &s;hould make &s;ome uncommon exertions to con|firm the faith of his allies, as well as to put him&s;elf upon a more re|&s;pectable footing at the en&s;uing congre&s;s. It is, notwith&s;tanding certain, that he contented him&s;elf with acting wholly upon the defen|&s;ive; a conduct, which perhaps his circum&s;tances had rendered ab&s;o|lutely unavoidable. Prince Henry commanded an army in Saxony, which entrenched it&s;elf &s;trongly un|der Leip&s;ic. M. Daun continued near Dre&s;den; and the&s;e two ar|mies did no more than watch each other during the campaign. The King was al&s;o entrenched in a very &s;trong po&s;ition in Upper Sile&s;ia, not far from Schweidnitz, whil&s;t the fortre&s;&s;es in the lower part of that country were filled with &s;uch garri|&s;ons, as put them out of the reach of any &s;udden in&s;ult.</P>
<P>This po&s;ition was pointed out by the motions and apparent de&s;igns of his enemies. The Ru&s;&s;ian army was this year, as well as in the for|mer, divided into two &s;trong bo|dies; one of which, led by Tot|tleben, directed its march towards Pomerania: and the other under M. Butterlin, entered into the Up|per Sile&s;ia, advancing towards Bre|&s;lau. Baron Laudohn entered that province in the part oppo&s;ite to them, and they propo&s;ed to unite their armies, in order to attack the King, or to take Bre&s;lau or Sch|weidnitz in his pre&s;ence. The remarkable drought in the begin|ning of the &s;ea&s;on, which had great|ly lowered the Oder, facilitated their junction. The Ru&s;&s;ians &s;pread them&s;elves over all the open coun|try of Sile&s;ia; and exacted heavy contributions. A body of them appeared before Bre|&s;lau, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 1.</NOTE> and began to cannonade the town from &s;even batteries. Lau|dohn exerted the whole of his &s;kill to draw the King from his po&s;t, and to engage him in a di&s;advan|tageous action. Sometimes he ad|vanced, as if he meant to join the Ru&s;&s;ians: &s;ometimes his motions
<PB N="229" REF="246">
indicated a de&s;ign on Schweidnitz; the&s;e attempts failing, he turned off and made a feint as if he propo&s;ed to fall upon the Lower Sile&s;ia, in hopes that he might at lea&s;t oblige the king of Pru&s;&s;ia to detach and di|vide his forces; but the king con|tinued immoveable in his po&s;t.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e various movements were making with little effect, on the &s;ide of Sile&s;ia, the other grand divi&s;ion of the Ru&s;&s;ians ad|vanced without oppo&s;ition into Po|merania; and it was expected that their proceedings would be attended with greater effect &s;ince the removal of Tottleben, and the appointment of general Romanzow to the com|mand. Tottleben had been long &s;u&s;pected, and, it is &s;aid, at length convicted, of a &s;ecret corre&s;pon|dence with the king of Pru&s;&s;ia. The &s;ituation of this Monarch oblig|ed him to fight with every &s;ort of weapon; and Tottleben, a &s;oldier of fortune, without any national at|tachment or particular allegiance, was a fit object for the king of Pru&s;&s;ia's pecuniary &s;tratagems. He did not &s;ucceed &s;o well in the at|tempts of the &s;ame kind which he is &s;aid to have made upon Laudohn. Every circum&s;tance concurred to render the method of corruption le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful in that quarter.</P>
<P>Colberg, regularly be&s;ieged, or clo&s;ely &s;treightened every campaign, &s;ince the Ru&s;&s;ions made them|&s;elves ma&s;ters of the kingdom of Pru&s;&s;ia, was now a&s;&s;aulted with greater and more determined force than ever. A &s;trong fleet, con&s;i&s;ting of forty &s;ail of all kinds, blockaded it by &s;ea, whil&s;t the army of ge|neral Romanzow formed the &s;iege by land. On the other hand, the place threatened a defence worthy of its former efforts. This city was from the beginning of the war of greater &s;trength than it had com|monly been repre&s;ented; every at|tempt of the Ru&s;&s;ians, by demon|&s;trating where any weakne&s;s lay, taught the Pru&s;&s;ians, who were fully &s;en&s;ible of its importance, in what part and in what manner it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to add to its works; and they had omitted no opportunity. In addition to this defence, the prince of Wurtenburg was &s;trongly en|trenched under the cannon of the town, with a body of &s;ix or &s;even thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>The king of Pru&s;&s;ia was extreme|ly alarmed at the danger of this momentous po&s;t, the key of his do|minions to the north, from the re|lief of which he was removed, and, as it were, chained down, at &s;uch an immen&s;e di&s;tance. Though Laudohn and Butturlin found abund|ant employment for all his forces, he re&s;olved to &s;end a con&s;iderable detachment under general Platen to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Colberg. The fer|tility of his genius propo&s;ed two ends from this &s;ingle expedient. He ordered Platen to direct his march through Poland, and to de|&s;troy the Ru&s;&s;ian magazines, which had been ama&s;&s;ed on the frontiers of that kingdom, and from which their army in Sile&s;ia drew its whole &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. This &s;ervice might, he hoped, be performed without any con&s;iderable interruption to the pro|gre&s;s of the detachment towards Colberg. The event was entirely an&s;werable to his wi&s;hes. General Platen ruined three principal ma|gazines of the enemy. He attack|ed a great convoy of their waggons; de&s;troyed 500, and burned or di&s;|per&s;ed the provi&s;ions they carried. Four thou&s;and men who protected this convoy were, for the greater
<PB N="230" REF="247">
part, killed or made pri&s;oners. Ge|neral Platen, after this u&s;eful and brilliant exploit, pur&s;ued his march with the utmo&s;t diligence to Pome|rania.</P>
<P>Intelligence of this blow was no &s;ooner received by the Ru&s;&s;ians in Sile&s;ia, than they were &s;truck with the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation. They had lately effected one of their pur|po&s;es <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 25th.</NOTE> by their junction with the Au&s;trians; but this &s;troke compelled them at once to &s;ever this union, &s;o lately and with &s;uch difficulty compa&s;&s;ed, to drop all their de&s;igns upon Bre&s;lau, to re|pa&s;s the Oder, and to retire without delay into Poland, le&s;t their re|maining magazines &s;hould &s;hare the &s;ame fate with the three above|mentioned, and their future &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence be thereby rendered wholly precarious.</P>
<P>So unfortunately circum&s;tanced were the affairs of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, that his wi&s;e&s;t &s;chemes and happie&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;es could hardly an|&s;wer any other end than to vary the &s;cene of his di&s;tre&s;s. The &s;torm which had been diverted from Si|le&s;ia by general Platen's expedition, was only removed from thence to be di&s;charged with irre&s;i&s;tible fury on Colberg. The Ru&s;&s;ians, when they &s;aw that the mea&s;ures the king had taken, rendered the completion of both their de&s;igns impracticable, re&s;olved at all adventures to &s;ecure one of them. Colberg was the ob|ject of their choice, not only as the place furthe&s;t from &s;uccour but as the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it would be an advantage fitte&s;t for an&s;wering tho&s;e ends which were more nearly and properly Ru&s;&s;ian. M. Butturlin, therefore, as &s;oon as he had e&s;ta|bli&s;hed his convoys, directed his cour&s;e towards Pomerania, and be|ing ma&s;ter of Lan&s;perg, he &s;ent de|tachments from thence, that cruelly wa&s;ted all the adjoining Marche of Brandenburg, without at the &s;ame time diverting him&s;elf by the&s;e ra|vages from his main intention.</P>
<P>A force of Ru&s;&s;ians was by this time a&s;&s;embled in Pomerania, to which it was impo&s;&s;ible for the king of Pru&s;&s;ia to oppo&s;e any thing that was in any degree able to contend with them in the field; of cour&s;e he could not promi&s;e him&s;elf that imme|diate rai&s;ing the &s;iege could be the ef|fect of the&s;e &s;uccours. All he could do was to &s;end another detachment to that part, under general Knob|lock; and hoped that by the union of the&s;e &s;everal &s;mall corps, and by their intercepting or at lea&s;t di&s;tre&s;|&s;ing the Ru&s;&s;ian convoys of provi|&s;ion, the place might be enabled to hold out, until the &s;evere &s;etting in of winter &s;hould render the opera|tions of a &s;iege impracticable.</P>
<P>He was providing in this manner, and &s;tudying new methods for the relief of Colberg, to the danger of which place his whole attention was drawn, when an event happened ju&s;t by him, and, as it were, under his eye, almo&s;t as di&s;tre&s;&s;ing as the taking of Colberg would have proved, and &s;o much the more di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing, as it was entirely unex|pected.</P>
<P>On the retreat of the Ru&s;&s;ians un|der Butturlin, the king of Pru&s;&s;ia imagined him&s;elf at liberty. He found a want of provi&s;ions in his &s;trong camp near Schweidnitz, and to be the more ea&s;ily &s;upplied, he approached nearer to the Oder. He was &s;o little in fear of the ene|my, that on making this movement, he drafted 4000 men from the gar|ri&s;on of Schweidnitz: he thought that the preparations nece&s;&s;ary to a
<PB N="231" REF="248">
&s;iege would give him &s;ufficient no|tice, and &s;ufficient lei&s;ure to provide for the &s;afety of that important place, from which after all, he had removed but to a very &s;mall di&s;|tance. Laudohn, who through the whole campaign had watched the king with a mo&s;t diligent and pene|trating a&s;&s;iduity, and hitherto had found no part open and unguarded, thought in this in&s;tant he perceived an advantage. It was indeed an advantage which would never have appeared as &s;uch, but to a general as re&s;olute as &s;agacious. He re|&s;olved to attempt this &s;trong place, by a <HI>coup de main.</HI> On the 1&s;t of October at three in the morning, the a&s;&s;ault began. An attack was made at the &s;ame time on all the four outworks, which the troops, ordered on this important enterprize approached with &s;o much precau|tion, that they were not perceived by the garri&s;on. They &s;caled all the four at the &s;ame time; and the troops which defended them had &s;carce time to fire a few cannon &s;hot. On the &s;ide of the a&s;&s;ailants, not a gun was di&s;charged: but in one of tho&s;e out-works the fire of the &s;mall-arms &s;et fire to a powder magazine, which blew up, and on this occa&s;ion about 300 of the Au&s;|trians, and about the &s;ame number of the Pru&s;&s;ians were killed. As &s;oon as the outworks were carried, they prepared to a&s;&s;ault the body of the place, which they entered by bur&s;ting open the gates, and at day|break they found them&s;elves ma&s;|ters of the town, after firing a few &s;hot. Five battalions, making about 3000 men, and lieutenant-general Za&s;trow, governor of the fortre&s;s, were made pri&s;oners. The con|querors found here a great number of cannon, and a large magazine of meal. Their lo&s;s in the whole of this bold and fortunate undertaking amounted, by their accounts, to no more than 600 men.</P>
<P>In a manner &s;o unexpected, and, con&s;idering the nature of the fortifi|cations, &s;o unprecedented, Schweid|nitz fell for a &s;econd time in this war into the hands of the Au&s;trians; and that city, which in the year 1758 had co&s;t the Pru&s;&s;ians a block|ade of &s;ome months, and a &s;iege of thirteen days open trenches to re|cover it, was again lo&s;t in a few hours, and with a very incon&s;idera|ble damage to tho&s;e who undertook this daring enterprize.</P>
<P>The king of Pru&s;&s;ia felt this grievous blow to the quick. By their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Schweidnitz he &s;aw the Au&s;trians enabled to winter in Sile&s;ia; he &s;aw that, whil&s;t they held this place, he could po&s;&s;ibly make no motion for the relief of any other part of his dominions without expo&s;ing Bre&s;lau, and along with it the whole of Upper Sile&s;ia, to a cer|tain and irrecoverable conque&s;t. In the fir&s;t agitations produced by &s;o extraordinary and affecting a di&s;a&s;|ter, he was di&s;po&s;ed to attribute this misfortune to the treachery of the governor, but he was too generous to harbour &s;uch a &s;u&s;picion, for any time, again&s;t an officer who had hi|therto &s;erved him with fidelity, and who might have been &s;urprized with an attack of &s;o uncommon a nature, and which the king him&s;elf had as little &s;u&s;pected as the governor. He immediately recovered his temper, and &s;aid with a &s;mile, <Q>&startq;It is a fatal blow; we mu&s;t endeavour to re|medy it.&endq;</Q> He wrote to general Za&s;trow who commanded there, <Q>&startq;We may now &s;ay, what Francis I. of France wrote to his mother after the battle of Pavia, <HI>We have</HI>
<PB N="232" REF="249">
<HI>lo&s;t all except our honour.</HI> As I cannot comprehend what hath happened to you, I &s;hall &s;u&s;pend my judgment; the thing is very extraordinary.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>Schweidnitz was lo&s;t &s;uddenly; but Colberg made a mo&s;t ob&s;tinate and noble defence. At length, however, the garri&s;on began to be &s;orely di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for provi&s;ions. Ge|neral Platen quitted the entrench|ments, which he had maintained in conjunction with the prince of Wur|tenburg, in order to cover the re|inforcements, which the numerous and &s;trong detachments of the Ru&s;&s;ians, who over&s;pread the whole country, had hitherto kept at a di&s;|tance. But he had the misfortune to meet an infinitely &s;uperior body of the enemy, to be beaten, and to lo&s;e part of his convoy; and it was with difficulty he e&s;caped with the remainder to Stetin.</P>
<P>The other (general Knoblock) had e&s;tabli&s;hed him&s;elf at Treptow, which was to &s;erve as a re&s;ting place for the convoys; but as general Platen had been repul&s;ed, in the manner we have ju&s;t &s;een, Roman|zow advanced with a large force to Treptow. Knoblock, hopele&s;s of a&s;&s;i&s;tance in a town which had &s;carcely any walls, and inve&s;ted by a body &s;o va&s;tly &s;uperior, yet made a vigorous and gallant defence for five days; he was at length compelled to &s;urrender him&s;elf and his body of about 2000 men pri&s;oners of war.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ive di&s;a&s;ters were oc|ca&s;ioned by the nece&s;&s;ity there was for revictualling Colberg, co&s;t what it would, and, for that end, of di&s;|per&s;ing the Pru&s;&s;ian troops in the face of a Ru&s;&s;ian army of 50,000 men. This revictualling in the&s;e circum&s;tances could not be effected without a &s;ingular piece of good for|tune; and, in order to get into the way of this good fortune, every ri&s;que was to be run.</P>
<P>The&s;e advantages over Platen and Knoblock rai&s;ed the &s;pirits of the Ru&s;&s;ians, and enabled them to con|tend with the extreme rigour of the &s;ea&s;on in that northern latitude; they pu&s;hed the &s;iege with redoubled efforts. All hope of a &s;upply from the land was ab&s;olutely at an end; and though the Ru&s;&s;ian fleet had been by a violent &s;torm driven off the coa&s;t, the &s;uccour from the &s;ea was too precarious to be depend|ed on. In this de&s;perate &s;ituation the prince of Wurtenburg became apprehen&s;ive, le&s;t his army, which had been unable to relieve the town, by delaying any longer under its walls would only &s;hare its fate, and that famine might al&s;o oblige him to &s;urrender. He therefore re&s;olved, whil&s;t his men retained their vigour, to break through a part of the Ru&s;&s;ian army, and to leave Colberg to make the be&s;t terms its circum&s;tances would admit. This de&s;ign he accompli&s;hed happily, and with little or no lo&s;s.</P>
<P>And now Colberg, hopele&s;s of all relief, the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 16th.</NOTE> garri&s;on exhau&s;ted, provi&s;ion low, the fortifications in many places bat|tered to pieces, after a long &s;iege of near &s;ix months, &s;urrendered to the Ru&s;&s;ians. The governor and the garri&s;on were made pri&s;oners of war. This place was defended by the gallant <HI>Heyde,</HI> who to this time had maintained it &s;ucce&s;sfully again&s;t all the efforts of the Ru&s;&s;ians dur|ing the war; and as he was di&s;|tingui&s;hed by the king his ma&s;ter for his merit in the &s;ucce&s;sful defence of it, he had likewi&s;e as full a&s;&s;urances of his favours after having on the late occa&s;ion conducted him&s;elf with his former bravery, though it was
<PB N="233" REF="250">
not with the former good for|tune.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of two &s;uch places as Schweidnitz and Colberg, at the two extremities of his dominions, were deci&s;ive again&s;t the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. It was now impo&s;&s;ible for him to make any movement by which the enemy could not profit to his al|mo&s;t certain de&s;truction. To form &s;ieges, with an army like his, infe|rior in the field, was impo&s;&s;ible. The Ru&s;&s;ians, by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing Col|berg, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed every thing. They were ma&s;ters of the Baltick; and they now acquired a port, by which their armies could be well provided, without the nece&s;&s;ity of tedious, un|certain, and expen&s;ive convoys from Poland. The road lay almo&s;t open into the heart of Brandenburg. Stetin alone &s;tood in their way; but it was obvious that nothing but the advanced &s;ea&s;on could &s;ave Stetin from the fate of Colberg. The Ru&s;&s;ians, now for the fir&s;t time, took up their winter quarters in Pomerania.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that this whole year pa&s;t without a regular battle between the King of Pru&s;&s;ia and any of his enemies, yet none of the mo&s;t unfortunate of his campaigns had been &s;o ruinous to him. He had &s;uffered four terrible defeats, with|out having ballanced them with a &s;ingle advantage of con&s;equence in the compaign of 1759. Yet in the&s;e circum&s;tances it is almo&s;t in|credible how little he really lo&s;t. He was able to take the field again the en&s;uing year in a very re&s;pect|able manner, and to make head again&s;t his enemies. In that year he lo&s;t a whole army near Land&s;hut; &s;till he was far from broken. Af|terwards in that &s;ame campaign, he gave his enemies two &s;ignal defeats, and ended his operations advantage|ou&s;ly, and with great glory. But in the year, of which we now write, without &s;uffering any con&s;iderable blow in the field, without any &s;triking efforts on any &s;ide, his power has gradually crumbled a|way. The mo&s;t calamitous de|feats could not &s;ink him lower. And in the &s;ituation in which he &s;tood after the taking of Colberg, we may &s;afely &s;ay, that there was &s;carcely a po&s;&s;ibility that he could be pre&s;erved from de&s;truction by any thing that lay within the reach of human endeavours.</P>

<P>AFTER having been &s;o long detained on the theatre of war, it is time we &s;hould return to take a view of the negotiation for putting an end to the mi&s;eries it oc|ca&s;ioned. In reality the view, even of this &s;cene, was very gloomy and unpromi&s;ing. The confidence and good humour of the two courts being &s;ubverted, all that followed was rather an altercation than a treaty. It is true, that papers pa&s;t backward and forward; and the preten&s;ions of each party, the points they agreed to cede, and tho&s;e which they were determined to adhere to, grew more di&s;tinct and explicit. But all that cordiality was
<PB N="234" REF="251">
vani&s;hed, which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to|wards &s;moothing and clearing a road, which a long ho&s;tility had broken up, and &s;o many intricate topics had contributed to embarra&s;s.</P>
<P>Without involving our&s;elves in the detail of the &s;everal memorials which were delivered in, and with|out referring numerically to the &s;e|veral articles, it will be &s;ufficient that we briefly &s;tate tho&s;e points which were, or &s;eemed to be, in a fair' way of adju&s;tment between England and France; and after|wards tho&s;e on which it &s;hould ap|pear that the negotiation broke off.</P>
<P>After &s;ome di&s;cu&s;&s;ions concern|ing its proper limits, it was agreed, that all Canada &s;hould be ceded to the Engli&s;h. This ce&s;&s;ion compre|hended, on one &s;ide, all the i&s;|lands and countries adjoining to the gulph of St. Laurence On the other, it took in all the great lakes, and the whole cour&s;e of the Ohio, to its di&s;charge into the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi. A territory &s;ufficient for the ba&s;is of a great empire.</P>
<P>In drawing this line of divi&s;ion, another que&s;tion aro&s;e concerning the bounds of Loui&s;iana, and the &s;tate of the intermediate Indian na|tion between the lakes and the Mi&s;|&s;i&s;ippi, who inhabit, or are rather &s;cattered over an immen&s;e country, that lies along the back of our co|lonies all the way from Pen&s;ylvania to Georgia. It was therefore very proper that &s;omething definitive &s;hould be &s;ettled on this article, as it might otherwi&s;e ea&s;ily be made productive of a new war. England propo&s;ed that all tho&s;e nations &s;hould continue, as &s;he contended they had heretofore been, under the protection of Great Britain, with|out &s;aying any thing preci&s;e as to the dominion of the &s;oil.</P>
<P>France controverted this propo|&s;ition; &s;he on her part propo&s;ed to divide the&s;e nations; that tho&s;e to the northward of the line drawn to a&s;certain the limits of Canada &s;hould be independent, under the protection of England, but that tho&s;e, which were to the &s;outhward, &s;hould enjoy the &s;ame independence, under the protection of France. Nothing was perfectly &s;ettled in relation to this point; but it does not &s;eem as if there could have been any material di&s;agreement up|on it, had the other matters in de|bate been adju&s;ted to their mutual &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>The African conte&s;t &s;eemed to have been attended with &s;till le&s;s difficulty. The French con&s;ented to give up both Senegal and Goree, provided Anamaboo and Acra were guarantied to them.</P>
<P>The momentous que&s;tion of the fi&s;hery was likewi&s;e determined. The French gave up their claim to Cape Breton and St. John's, and were &s;atisfied to receive the little i&s;land of St. Pierre on the coa&s;t of Newfoundland; but even this they were to receive on conditions &s;uffi|ciently humiliating. They were to erect no &s;ort of fortification, nor to keep up any military e&s;tabli&s;hment there. An Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;ary was to re&s;ide on the i&s;land, in order to &s;ee that the&s;e &s;tipulations were adhered to. As to the re&s;t, the French were to have the &s;ame privileges on the coa&s;t of Newfoundland, checked with the &s;ame re&s;trictions, which before the war they had enjoyed un|der the 15th article of the treaty of Utrecht. In conformity to another article of that treaty, and in com|pen&s;ation for the privilege of the fi&s;hery, they con&s;ented that Dun|kirk &s;hould be demoli&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="252">
Concerning the i&s;lands of Gua|daloupe, Marigalante, Minorca, and Bellei&s;le, no great controver&s;y had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted from the beginning. It had all along been agreed, that the&s;e conque&s;ts &s;hould be recipro|cally re&s;tored. Neither did the French &s;cruple to adopt our propo|&s;al concerning the affairs of the Ea&s;t Indies, nor to make &s;atisfactory de|clarations concerning O&s;tend and Neuport.</P>
<P>So many delicate and intere&s;ting points were &s;ettled, that it does not at fir&s;t appear what it was that could have retarded the peace. A di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the &s;eparate intere&s;ts of two powers only, that are in ear|ne&s;t to agree, may be &s;ettled with|out any very con&s;iderable difficul|ty. The hard and almo&s;t inextri|cable part of the knot, is that wherein the cro&s;s concerns and in|tere&s;ts of allies intervene. There were two points upon which, if we may form a judgment from appear|ances, this negotiation unfortunate|ly broke off. The fir&s;t was upon the manner in which England and France might be at liberty to a&s;&s;i&s;t their re&s;pective allies; and on the re&s;titution of We&s;el, Gueldres, and &s;uch other places as the French had conquered from his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t member of this prin|cipal point, the repeated propo&s;als of France for a neutrality in Ger|many had been uniformly and po|&s;itively rejected by our admini&s;tra|tion. They were con&s;idered as &s;o many attacks upon national integri|ty. This &s;cheme therefore not being admitted, they would or could come to no agreement, and &s;carcely to an intelligible explanation either of the mode or the quantity of the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance which they &s;hould be at li|berty mutually to impart to their German allies, or of the place in which &s;uch &s;uccours &s;hould be em|ployed. As to We&s;el and Gueldres, the French ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed to re&s;tore tho&s;e places. They de|clared that &s;uch a ce&s;&s;ion would be directly again&s;t the faith by which they were bound to the empre&s;s queen of Hungary, for whom they in&s;i&s;ted that the&s;e places had been conquered, and in who&s;e name alone they were governed, though they had been reduced by the French arms, and were at that moment held by French garri&s;ons.</P>
<P>As to the &s;econd point, namely, the re&s;titution of captures made previous to the declaration of war, the negotiating powers were equally po&s;itive, the one to demand, the other to refu&s;e it. The Engli&s;h argu|ed that this claim had no &s;ort of foun|dation in the law of nations, nei|ther was it grounded on any parti|cular convention. That the right of all ho&s;tile operations re&s;ults, not from a formal declaration of war, but from the ho&s;tilities which the aggre&s;&s;or has fir&s;t offered; that the contrary of this propo&s;ition is at lea&s;t extremely conte&s;tible; and &s;ince it can by no means be clearly e&s;tabli&s;hed, it follows that the de|tainment of tho&s;e captures mu&s;t be con&s;idered, on the &s;ide of Eng|land, as part of the <HI>uti po&s;&s;idetis,</HI> ori|ginally propo&s;ed as the ba&s;is of this treaty.</P>
<P>France, on the other hand, &s;eem|ed as fully convinced of the ju&s;tice of her preten&s;ions, and &s;he deemed the arguments with which &s;he &s;up|ported them to be &s;o unan&s;werable, that &s;he offered to &s;ubmit them to the ju&s;tice of the Engli&s;h tribunals. They urged that this claim of re&s;ti|tution was founded on the law of
<PB N="236" REF="253">
nations, and upon particular con|vention; on particular conven|tion; by the 19th article of the peace of Utrecht; and by the &s;e|cond article of the treaty of com|merce; and that this was &s;trength|ened by the 3d article of the treaty of Aix la Chapelle, which renews and confirms tho&s;e articles in the preceding treaties.</P>
<P>By the&s;e articles a protection is allowed to the re&s;pective &s;ubjects who may have &s;hips in the ports of either of the powers, becau&s;e hav|ing no opportunity of knowing that a rupture is fallen out, they &s;ailed under the &s;ecurity of peace and un|der the &s;aith of treaties. By a pa|rity of rea&s;oning, the &s;hips not actu|ally in tho&s;e ports ought to enjoy the &s;ame &s;ecurity; el&s;e, as they are included in the &s;ame parity of cir|cum&s;tances, it would follow, con|trary to the principles of humanity and right rea&s;on, that the &s;ove|reigns had provided for the pre&s;er|vation of one part of their &s;ubjects from the mi&s;eries of a &s;udden rup|ture, to which they expo&s;e the re&s;t. The particular conventions of the&s;e treaties, they &s;aid, had their foun|dation in general equity and the law of nations; &s;ince, as it is im|practicable for belligerent &s;tates to agree among&s;t them&s;elves which is the aggre&s;&s;or, it is proper that the &s;ubjects &s;hould receive previous no|tice of the rupture, in order that they may be able di&s;tinctly to know when they are, or are not in &s;ecu|rity, or when they may, or may not rely on the treaties which &s;ub|&s;i&s;t between their &s;overeigns.</P>
<P>The&s;e topics were as u&s;ual, ban|died to and fro with great heat and little effect; and as in &s;uch di&s;cu&s;&s;i|ons the arguments on both &s;ides are plau&s;ible, and there can be no authori&s;ed judge, the weight of the &s;everal preten&s;ions commonly depends upon the power of the par|ties to enforce them. On the&s;e two points therefore, the renunciation of German alliances, and the re&s;ti|tution of captures, the negotiation from the beginning was at a &s;tand; and on the&s;e at length, to all ap|pearance, it finally broke off.</P>
<P>Not but we are fully &s;atisfied that the di&s;agreement even on the&s;e points might have been only the o&s;|ten&s;ible cau&s;e of the rupture. The true cau&s;e of the breach &s;eems to have been the un&s;ea&s;onable inter|po&s;ition of the Spani&s;h claims. For could France be &s;uppo&s;ed in good earne&s;t to de&s;ire peace, that is, to de&s;ire &s;uch a rea&s;onable peace as her circum&s;tances might demand, when &s;he officiou&s;ly mingled with our particular debate, the affairs of a foreign and neutral power, which had not the &s;malle&s;t connection with tho&s;e that were at this time proper|ly under deliberation? It was ridi|culous to urge, that this was done from a prudent fore&s;ight, and to prevent a future war, which the&s;e di&s;putes might po&s;&s;ibly occa&s;ion. The bu&s;ine&s;s was to put an end to the war which then actually &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ed; and nothing could be farther from a&s;&s;i&s;ting this de&s;ign than to in|crea&s;e the &s;ubjects of debate. France mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of the weight of this argument, who her&s;elf propo&s;|ed in the very beginning of this treaty, as means almo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for carrying it on with effect, that their particular di&s;pute &s;hould be &s;eparated from tho&s;e of their Ger|man allies, with which it certainly had a more natural connection than with tho&s;e that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between England and Spain; as all the for|mer parties were then engaged di|rectly
<PB N="237" REF="254">
or indirectly in the war, to which Spain had then no manner of relation.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h mini&s;try finding the French immoveable on the two ca|pital points above-mentioned, and having no opinion of the &s;incerity of their procedure, &s;ent directions to Mr. Stanley to return to England, and to de&s;ire that M. Bu&s;&s;y &s;hould, on the part of his court, receive the &s;ame orders. <NOTE PLACE="marg">20th Sept.</NOTE> An end was thus put to this negoti|ation, (from which Europe had conceived &s;uch &s;anguine hopes of the alleviation of its mi&s;eries) after it had continued near &s;ix months. So far indeed was it from producing the happy effects that were propo&s;|ed from it, &s;o far was it from appea&s;|ing the animo&s;ities of the powers originally engaged, or from extin|gui&s;hing the old war, that the par|ties &s;eparated with intentions more ho&s;tile, and opinions more adver&s;e than ever; and the war was &s;oon &s;pread to a much greater extent by the taking in of a new party, and may po&s;&s;ibly &s;pread, &s;till more widely, by laying open new &s;ources of contention which may gradually draw in other powers, and finally involve every part of Europe. It was al&s;o a means of producing changes in England, which at a time of le&s;s tranquility, and in cir|cum&s;tances of le&s;s internal &s;trength, might have been productive of the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences. But the&s;e matters are re&s;erved for the &s;ubject of the en&s;uing chapter.</P>

<P>AS nothing could have been more unprecedented, &s;o no|thing was more alarming than the proceeding of the court of Spain in the negotiation. It was altogether extraordinary to &s;ee a propo&s;al for accommodating di&s;putes that &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted between friends, coming thro' the channel of an enemy. It was extremely &s;ingular to &s;ee points of &s;uch con&s;equence formally commu|nicated and propo&s;ed for delibera|tion by a French agent, commi&s;&s;ion|ed only to negotiate a particular and di&s;tinct bu&s;ine&s;s, when the Spa|niards had an amba&s;&s;ador re&s;iding in London, from whom no &s;ort of intimation had been previou&s;ly re|ceived of &s;uch a de&s;ign.</P>
<P>That propo&s;al not only marked out a want of &s;incerity on the part of France, but it manife&s;ted &s;o &s;trange and irregular a partiality on the part of Spain, that it would very little have become the dignity of the King of Great Britain, or his attention to the &s;afety of his &s;ub|jects, to let it pa&s;s without a full and &s;atisfactory explanation. Ac|cordingly the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador was called upon to di&s;avow this ir|regular procedure; but he returned
<PB N="238" REF="255">
a verbal, and &s;oon after was autho|ri&s;ed by his court to return, a writ|ten an&s;wer in which he openly a|vowed and ju&s;tified the &s;tep taken by the French agent, as entirely agreeable to the &s;entiments of his ma&s;ter. He declared that the Kings of France and Spain were united not only by the ties of blood, but by a mutual intere&s;t. He applauded the humanity and greatne&s;s of mind which his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian maje&s;ty demon&s;trated in the propo&s;ition that was complained of. He in&s;i&s;t|ed much on the &s;incere de&s;ire of peace, the only motive which in|fluenced the conduct of the two mo|narchs; and he added, haughtily, that if his ma&s;ter had been govern|ed by any other principles, "his Catholic maje&s;ty giving full &s;cope to his greatne&s;s, would have &s;poken from him&s;elf, and as became his dignity."</P>
<P>It appeared evidently from the whole of this paper, that the court of Spain was regularly, as a &s;ort of party, appri&s;ed of ever &s;tep that was taken in the negotiation; that her judgment was appealed to up|on every point, and her authority called in aid to force the acceptance of the terms which were offered by France; in a word, that there was a perfect union of affections, intere&s;ts, and councils between the&s;e two courts; and the mini&s;ter of the former, &s;o far from denying or palliating this conduct, &s;eemed to glory in it.</P>
<P>Mr. Pitt who then took the lead in the mini&s;try, was fully &s;atisfied the intentions of Spain were by no means equivocal, and that this partiality, which they &s;trongly avowed not only by declarations, but by facts, would drive them into all the mea|&s;ures of France. That a war on that account was ab&s;olutely inevitable; and if, for the pre&s;ent moment, the Spaniards rather delayed their de|claration of war, than laid a&s;ide their ho&s;tile intentions, it was in order to &s;trike the blow at their own time, and with the greater ef|fect; that therefore their rea&s;ons for delaying to act were the very motives, which ought to induce us to act with the utmo&s;t &s;peed, and utmo&s;t vigour. That we ought to con&s;ider the eva&s;ions of that court as a refu&s;al of &s;atisfaction, and that refu&s;al, as a declaration of war. That we ought from prudence as well as from &s;pirit to &s;ecure our|&s;elves the fir&s;t blow; and to be practically convinced, that the early and effective mea&s;ures, which had &s;o large a &s;hare in reducing France to this dependence upon Spain, would al&s;o be the fitte&s;t for deter|ring or di&s;abling Spain from afford|ing any protection to France. That, to carry on this war with vigour, it was only nece&s;&s;ary to continue our pre&s;ent efforts; no new arma|ment would be nece&s;&s;ary; and that, if any war could provide its own re|&s;ources, it mu&s;t be a war with Spain. That their flota had not yet arrived, and that the taking of it, would at once di&s;able theirs and &s;trengthen our hands. This procedure &s;o &s;uit|ed to the dignity of the nation, and the in&s;ults it had received, would be a le&s;&s;on to Spain, and to every other power, how they &s;hould pre|&s;ume to dictate in our affairs, and to intermeddle with a menacing medi|ation, and an officiou&s;ne&s;s as in&s;i|dious as it was audacious. That he would allow our enemies, whe|ther &s;ecret or declared, no time to think and recollect them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;entiments, &s;o agreeable to the re&s;olute and enterpri&s;ing cha|racter
<PB N="239" REF="256">
of this mini&s;ter, appeared &s;hocking to almo&s;t all the re&s;t of his collegues. They admitted that we ought not to be terrified from the a&s;&s;ertions of our ju&s;t demands, by the menaces of any power. They owned that Spain had taken a very extraordinary and very unju&s;ti|fiable &s;tep; but that we ought to ad|mit and even to wi&s;h for, an expla|nation; this court, upon a &s;ober yet &s;pirited remon&s;trance, might recall that ra&s;h propo&s;ition into which they had been perhaps unwarily &s;e|duced by the artifices of France; that to &s;hun war upon a ju&s;t oc|ca&s;ion was cowardice, but to pro|voke or court it was madne&s;s. And, if to court a war was not in ge|neral a very wi&s;e mea&s;ure, to de&s;ire it with Spain, if po&s;&s;ibly it could be avoided, was to overturn the mo&s;t fundamental principles of the po|licy of both nations. That this de&s;ire of adding war to war, and enemy to enemy, whil&s;t we had our hands already as full as they could hold, and whil&s;t all our faculties were &s;trained to the utmo&s;t pitch, was ill to calculate the national &s;trength of our country, which, however great, had its limits, and was not able to contend with all the world; that whil&s;t we were call|ing for new enemies, no mention was made of new allies, nor indeed of any new re&s;ource what&s;oever. To plunge into &s;uch mea&s;ures, in the manner propo&s;ed, and upon no better grounds, could not fail to &s;candalize and to alarm all Europe; and we could po&s;&s;ibly derive no ad|vantage from this precipitate con|duct, which would not be more than counter-balanced by the jealou&s;y and terror it would nece&s;&s;arily create in every nation near us. As to the &s;eizure of the flota, it was not to be reckoned upon, as at the very time of that deliberation it might be ex|pected to be &s;afe in its harbour; and perhaps if we could &s;ucceed in &s;eizing it, we might perform a &s;er|vice not very agreeable to neutral nations, and as little advantageous to our own commerce. If Spain, blind to her true intere&s;ts, and mi&s;|led by French councils, &s;hould give in a more deci&s;ive manner into the de&s;igns of that court, and ob&s;tinately refu&s;e a rea&s;onable &s;ati&s;|faction, it would be then the true time to declare war, when all the neighbouring and impartial powers were convinced that we acted with as much temper as re&s;olution, and when every thinking man at home &s;hould be &s;atisfied that he was not hurried into the hazards and ex|pences of war, from an idea of chi|merical heroi&s;m, but from inevitable nece&s;&s;ity; and that in &s;uch a ca&s;e we might depend upon the utmo&s;t &s;upport which the nation could give to an admini&s;tration that depended upon its &s;trength, and yet dreaded to wa&s;te it wantonly, or to employ it unju&s;tly. The mini&s;ter, warmed by this oppo&s;ition, declared that, <Q>&startq;This was the time for humbling the whole hou&s;e of Bourbon; that if this opportunity were let &s;lip, it might never be recovered; and if he could not prevail in this in|&s;tance, he was re&s;olved that this was the la&s;t time he would &s;it in that council. He thanked the mini&s;ters of the late king for their &s;upport; &s;aid he was him&s;elf called to the mini&s;try by the voice of the people, to whom he con&s;idered him&s;elf as accounta|ble for his conduct; and that he would no longer remain in a &s;itu|ation which made him re&s;pon&s;i|ble for mea&s;ures he was no longer allowed to guide.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="257">
The noble lord, who pre&s;ided in this council, to whom years have added the wi&s;dom of experience, without abating the vigour and fire of youth; and who was him&s;elf as bold a mini&s;ter as ever directed the affairs of this nation, made him this reply. <Q>&startq;I find the gentleman is determined to leave us, nor can I &s;ay I am &s;orry for it, &s;ince he would otherwi&s;e have certain|ly compelled us to leave him; but, if he be re&s;olved to a&s;&s;ume the right of advi&s;ing his maje&s;ty, and directing the operations of the war, to what purpo&s;e are we called to this council? When he talks of being re&s;pon&s;ible to the people, he talks the language of the hou&s;e of commons, and for|gets, that at this board, he is only re&s;pon&s;ible to the king. How|ever, though he may po&s;&s;ibly have convinced him&s;elf of his infallibi|lity, &s;till it remains that we &s;hould be equally convinced before we can re&s;ign our under&s;tanding to his direction, or join with him in the mea&s;ure he propo&s;es.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>On the divi&s;ion, the mini&s;ter him&s;elf, and a noble lord clo&s;ely connected with him, were the only voices in favour of the immediate declaration of war; the re&s;t of the board were unanimou&s;ly again&s;t it.</P>
<P>The reader will ob&s;erve that to|gether with tho&s;e matters, which have been publi&s;hed, relative to this very important deliberation, with &s;ome appearance of authenticity, we have added &s;uch arguments as have been agitated among the peo|ple; a liberty nece&s;&s;ary to place the matter in its full light.</P>
<P>Mr. Pitt and lord Temple, ad|hering to their fir&s;t opinion, and having delivered their rea&s;ons in writing, re&s;igned their employ|ments. This re&s;ignation &s;eemed equal to a revolution in the &s;tate. An univer&s;al alarm was &s;pread; a thou&s;and rumours flew abroad, and the fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;tions were, that this great mini&s;ter, endeavouring to avail him&s;elf by his firmne&s;s in negotia|tion of the advantages he had ac|quired by his vigour in war, was oppo&s;ed by the whole council, who were re&s;olved to have a peace at any rate, and that this oppo&s;ition had driven him to re&s;ign the &s;eals. But the true cau&s;e of the re&s;ignation very &s;oon came out; and on this point a violent conflict en&s;ued, in which the popular cau&s;e was wor&s;e &s;u&s;|tained, and the mini&s;terial better, (that is, with greater effect) than is u&s;ual in &s;uch di&s;cu&s;&s;ions. Some cir|cum&s;tances contributed not a little to this &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>When Mr. Pitt re&s;igned the &s;eals, the great per&s;on to whom they were delivered received them with ea&s;e and firmne&s;s, without reque&s;ting that he &s;hould re&s;ume his office. His maje&s;ty expre&s;&s;ed his concern for the lo&s;s of &s;o able a &s;ervant; and to &s;hew the favourable &s;en&s;e he entertained of his &s;ervices, he made him a mo&s;t gracious and unlimited offer of any rewards in the power of the crown to be&s;tow. His maje&s;ty at the &s;ame time expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf not only &s;atisfied with the opinion of the majority of his council, but declared he would have found him|&s;elf under the greate&s;t difficulty how to have acted, had that council con|curred as fully in &s;upporting the mea&s;ure propo&s;ed by Mr. Pitt, as they had done in rejecting it. A &s;entiment (in the light in which his maje&s;ty con&s;idered this mea&s;ure) grounded upon the firme&s;t principles of integrity and honour, and which mu&s;t rai&s;e the highe&s;t veneration for

<PB N="241" REF="259">
his royal character not only among his own &s;ubjects, but among&s;t all nations, when they &s;ee a power which has &s;o little to fear from any human effort, &s;o very fearful of the lea&s;t infringement of the &s;tricte&s;t and mo&s;t critical rules of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Mr. Pitt was &s;en&s;ibly touched with the grandeur and conde&s;cen|&s;ion of this proceeding. `I confe&s;s, Sir, I had but too much rea&s;on to expect your maje&s;ty's di&s;plea&s;ure. I did not come prepared for this ex|ceeding goodne&s;s. Pardon me, Sir,&mdash;it overpowers, it oppre&s;&s;es me.' He bur&s;t into tears.</P>
<P>We are far from an attempt to add any colouring to &s;o exqui&s;itely affecting a picture. We are indeed far from being able to do ju&s;tice to perhaps one of the mo&s;t pathetic and elevated &s;cenes which could po&s;&s;ibly be di&s;played, the parting of &s;uch a prince, and &s;uch a mi|ni&s;ter.</P>
<P>The next day a pen&s;ion of three thou&s;and pounds a year was &s;ettled on Mr. Pitt for three lives, and at the &s;ame time a title was conferred upon his lady and her i&s;&s;ue; a pen|&s;ion the be&s;t be&s;towed, and a nobi|lity the mo&s;t honourably acquir|ed, and mo&s;t truly merited. Im|mediately the Gazette gave notice to the public of all the&s;e tran&s;ac|tions. The re&s;ignation made the fir&s;t article; the honours and re|wards the next; and they were fol|lowed by a letter from our amba&s;|&s;ador in Spain, containing an ac|count of the favourable and pacific language of that court, and of the &s;trong a&s;&s;urance they gave of a de|&s;ire to accommodate all differences in an amicable manner.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be owned that this ma|noeuvre was very &s;kilfully executed. For it at once gave the people to un|der&s;tand the true motive to the re|&s;ignation; the in&s;ufficiency of that motive, and the graciou&s;ne&s;s of the K. notwith&s;tanding the abrupt de|parture of his mini&s;ter. If after this the late mini&s;ter &s;hould chu&s;e to enter into oppo&s;ition, he mu&s;t go into it loaded and oppre&s;&s;ed with the imputation of the blacke&s;t ingratitude: if on the other hand he &s;hould retire from bu&s;ine&s;s, or &s;hould concur in &s;upport of that ad|mini&s;tration which he had left, be|cau&s;e he di&s;approved its mea&s;ures, his acquie&s;cence would be attribut|ed by the multitude to a bargain for his for&s;aking the public, and that the title and the pen&s;ion were the con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the barriers that were oppo&s;ed again&s;t that torrent of po|pular rage, which it was appre|hended would proceed from this re&s;ignation. And the truth is, they an&s;wered their end perfectly: this torrent for &s;ome time was beaten back, almo&s;t diverted into an op|po&s;ite cour&s;e; and when afterwards it returned to tho&s;e objects, again&s;t which it was originally directed, and where it was mo&s;t dreaded, it was no longer that impetuous and irre&s;i&s;tible tide, which in the year 1757 had borne down every thing before it; it was weakened, divid|ed, and ineffective.</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion the clamorous and inferior members of each party went lengths, which undoubtedly were neither authori&s;ed nor ap|proved by their leaders. The friends of Mr. Pitt rai&s;ed the mo&s;t violent clamours for di&s;placing a mini&s;ter, who&s;e mea&s;ures had rai&s;ed the nation from the mo&s;t abject &s;tate, to the highe&s;t pinacle of glory. <Q>They &s;aid, that &startq;he was in fact di&s;placed, when he was com|pelled

to re&s;ign, by not being &s;uffered to carry into execution tho&s;e mea&s;ures which he knew to be nece&s;&s;ary to the honour and &s;afety of his country. That the check which this mini&s;ter had received, would mo&s;t un&s;ea&s;on|ably revive the drooping hopes of France, &s;unk by the vigour of our military operations, and the firm|ne&s;s of our councils under his admini&s;tration, and would &s;hew Spain with what impunity &s;he might in&s;ult the honour of the Briti&s;h crown, and violate the property of its &s;ubjects. They reckoned up the di&s;graces which the nation had &s;uffered before Mr. Pitt had entered into the management of affairs, and the victories and conque&s;ts which were the fruit of his councils.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the&s;e rea&s;on|ings, addre&s;&s;es, re&s;olutions and in|&s;tructions were &s;et on foot in the great corporations; and it was be|lieved that the example would be followed, as on a former occa&s;ion of the &s;ame kind, by all the other cities and boroughs of the king|dom. But the progre&s;s of this mea&s;ure, though commenced with much alacrity, was &s;low and lan|guid; a few only of the corpora|tions entered into it, and &s;ome even of the&s;e few in a manner le&s;s warm than was expected. A &s;trenuous defence was made on the part of the remaining mini&s;try.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Was it ever heard, &s;aid they, that a &s;overeign has been cen&s;ured for li&s;tening to the whole body of his council, in preference to the particular opinions of a &s;ingle man? On the contrary, this un|controuled &s;way of a &s;ingle mini|&s;ter has been often thought dan|gerous, and was always odious in our free con&s;titution; and is the more ju&s;tly to be di&s;liked, as per|haps incon&s;i&s;tent with the true &s;pirit, either of ab&s;olute monar|chy, or of limited government. Let the merit of this mini&s;ter be what it will, &s;hall his ma&s;ter therefore be forced to receive him upon any terms? Mu&s;t his prince, to gratify his ambitious views, or if you plea&s;e, his virtu|ous intentions, di&s;mi&s;s his whole council, and annihilate his pre|rogative as a king, his rea&s;on and judgment as a man? Was it ever heard before, that a coun|&s;ellor has profe&s;&s;ed without any re&s;erve or any ma&s;k, that becau&s;e he could not guide in government, he would not co-operate? This has unque&s;tionably been the true motive for the conduct of many mini&s;ters, but never was the avowed motive until this occa&s;ion. Mr. Pitt has had the free&s;t &s;cope for the exertion of his genius; he was, perhaps, the only Engli&s;h mini&s;ter that never met with the &s;lighte&s;t oppo&s;ition; he has had the trea&s;ures and the forces of the nation at his mo&s;t ab&s;olute command; let him, in his turn, do that ju&s;tice that has been done to him; let him, if the favours of the crown con&s;titute no obli|gation, be bound at lea&s;t by the rules of equity; and if he will not partake in the conduct of the pre&s;ent mo&s;t intricate and diffi|cult bu&s;ine&s;s of admini&s;tration, let him not render it &s;till more intricate and more difficult by his oppo&s;ition; and let him not &s;tudy to find a ju&s;tification of his mea|&s;ures, from the ill &s;ucce&s;s of tho&s;e whom he has left, when that ill &s;ucce&s;s will be owing to his own devices.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>Thus far the points &s;eem to have been urged with propriety and
<PB N="243" REF="261">
weight. A torrent, however, of low and illiberal abu&s;e was al&s;o poured out on this occa&s;ion. His whole life, public and private, was &s;crutinized with the utmo&s;t maligni|ty, to furni&s;h matter of calumny a|gain&s;t him. The &s;ucce&s;&s;es of his ad|mini&s;tration were depreciated; his faults were mon&s;trou&s;ly exaggerated, and the rewards and honours &s;o ju&s;t|ly conferred on him by his &s;overeign, were by every trick of wit, ridicule, and buffoonery, converted into mat|ter of degradation and di&s;grace.</P>
<P>Without pre&s;uming to take any part in a controver&s;y, which (how|ever unequally) divided the royal council, or without entering into the &s;entiments of any faction, which we have always &s;hunned, we may affirm with truth and impartiality, that no man was ever better fitted than Mr. Pitt, to be the mini&s;ter in a great and powerful nation, or better qualified to carry that power and greatne&s;s to their utmo&s;t limits. There was in all his de&s;igns a mag|nitude, and even a va&s;tne&s;s, which was not ea&s;ily comprehended by every mind, and which nothing but &s;ucce&s;s could have made to appear rea&s;onable. If he was &s;ometimes incorrect, he was never vulgar.</P>
<P>His power, as it was not acquir|ed, &s;o neither was it exerci&s;ed in an ordinary manner. With very little parliamentary, and with le&s;s court influence, he &s;wayed both at court and in parliament with an authority unknown before, to the be&s;t &s;upported mini&s;ters. He was called to the mini&s;try by the voice of the people; and what is more rare, he held it with that approbation; and under him for the fir&s;t time, admi|ni&s;tration and popularity were &s;een united. Under him Great Britain carried on the mo&s;t important war in which &s;he ever was engaged, alone and una&s;&s;i&s;ted, with greater &s;plendour, and with more &s;ucce&s;s than &s;he had ever enjoyed at the head of the mo&s;t powerful alliances. Alone this i&s;land &s;eemed to ballance the re&s;t of Europe.</P>
<P>In the conduct of the war he ne|ver &s;uffered the enemy to breathe, but overwhelmed them with re-iter|ated blows, and kept up the alarm in every quarter. If one of his ex|peditions was not &s;o well calculated or &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully executed, amends were made by another, and by a third. The &s;pirit of the nation once rou&s;ed, was not &s;uffered for a moment to &s;ub&s;ide; and the French, dazzled, as it were, by the multi|tude and celerity of his enterprizes, &s;eemed to have lo&s;t all power of re&s;i&s;tance. In &s;hort, he revived the military genius of our people; he &s;upported our allies; he extended our trade; he rai&s;ed our reputation; he augmented our dominions; and on his departure from admini&s;tra|tion, left the nation in no other danger than that which ever mu&s;t attend exorbitant power, and the temptation which may be, to the in|vidious exertion of it. Happy it had been for him, for his &s;overeign, and his country, if a temper le&s;s au&s;tere, and a di&s;po&s;ition more practicable, more compliant, and conciliating, had been joined to his other great virtues. The want of the&s;e qualities di&s;abled him from acting any otherwi&s;e than alone: it prevented our enjoying the joint fruit of the wi&s;dom of many able men, who might mutually have tempered, and mutually forwarded each other; and finally, which was not the meane&s;t lo&s;s, it deprived us of his own immediate &s;ervices.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="262">
Tho&s;e who cen&s;ured his political conduct the mo&s;t &s;everely, could rai&s;e but few exceptions to it; none of them &s;ingly and perhaps, the whole united, of no great weight again&s;t a per&s;on long engaged in &s;o great a &s;cene of action.</P>
<P>Whether the part, which under his admini&s;tration we rather conti|nued to act than newly took, with regard to the affairs of Germany, be for the real intere&s;t of Great Britain, is a que&s;tion of the utmo&s;t difficulty, and which perhaps will never admit a &s;atisfactory &s;olution. To condemn him on this head we mu&s;t be &s;ure of this &s;olution. It has been ob&s;erved in favour of that conte&s;ted mea&s;ure, that France de|mon&s;trated, through the whole pro|gre&s;s of the late treaty, the mo&s;t earne&s;t de&s;ire, that we &s;hould aban|don the German connection; no trifling argument, that our enemy did not look upon it to be extreme|ly prejudicial to our intere&s;ts. If he has carried on that war at a va&s;t expence, a prodigious &s;tand has been made again&s;t the entire power of France; had le&s;s been expended, the whole expence might have been lo&s;t. How far this part of his con|duct was agreeable to his former declarations, is a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion which can avail but little. He found the nation engaged in the&s;e affairs; it was more ea&s;y to pu&s;h them for|ward, than to extricate him&s;elf from them; as he proceeded, he di&s;cover|ed by experience the advantages of that plan of action, and his opinion was changed.</P>
<P>But even admitting, that, to at|tain the ends of oppo&s;ition, he had once fallen upon popular topics, which even then he knew were not tenable, it can form but a very &s;mall blemi&s;h in a public character, how|ever wrong it may be by application to the &s;trict rules of morality. Ill would it fare with &s;tate&s;men if this &s;ort of con&s;i&s;tency were to be expect|ed from the mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent of them.</P>
<P>With regard to the pen&s;ion and title, it is a &s;hame that any defence &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary. What eye cannot di&s;tingui&s;h, at the fir&s;t glance, the difference between this and the exceptionable ca&s;e of titles and pen&s;ions? What Briton, with the &s;malle&s;t &s;en&s;e of honour and grati|tude, but mu&s;t blu&s;h for his coun|try, if &s;uch a man retired unreward|ed from the public &s;ervice, let the motives to that retirement be what they would? It was not po&s;&s;ible that his &s;overeign could let his emi|nent &s;ervices pa&s;s unrequited; the &s;um that was given was undoubted|ly inadequate to his merits; and the quantum was rather regulated by the moderation of the great mind that received it, than by the libe|rality of that which be&s;towed it.</P>
<P>The conduct of Mr. Pitt when the parliament met, in which he made his own ju&s;tification, without impeaching the conduct of any of his collegues, or talking one mea&s;ure that might &s;eem to ari&s;e from di&s;|gu&s;t or oppo&s;ition, has &s;et a &s;eal upon his character.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. <HI>Di&s;pute with Spain. Repre&s;entation of the earl of Bri&s;tol. Di&s;po&s;ition of the court of Madrid. Treaty between France and Spain. England de&s;ires a communication. Court of Spain refu&s;es. The mini&s;ters mu|tually withdraw. A rupture.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE unfortunate intervention of Spain in the late negotia|tion, rai&s;ed &s;o many difficulties, and created &s;o much mi&s;chief both abroad and at home, that it becomes an aera in this hi&s;tory, and it is nece&s;|&s;ary we &s;hould pur&s;ue that object from the point at which we left it, to its final and fatal determination.</P>
<P>The an&s;wer which had been re|ceived from the Spani&s;h mini&s;ter in London was far from being &s;atisfac|tory to our court. Orders were im|mediately given to the earl of Bri|&s;tol, our amba&s;&s;ador in Spain, to re|mon&s;trate with energy and firmne&s;s on &s;o extraordinary a proceeding; to adhere to the negative put upon the Spani&s;h preten&s;ions to fi&s;h at Newfoundland; to re&s;t the article of di&s;puted captures, on the ju&s;tice of our tribunals; to continue the former profe&s;&s;ions of our de&s;ire of an amicable adju&s;tment of the log|wood di&s;pute; and of our willing|ne&s;s to cau&s;e the &s;ettlements on the coa&s;t of Honduras to be evacuated, as &s;oon as ever his Catholick maje&s;ty &s;hould &s;ugge&s;t a method for our en|joyment of that traffic to which we had a right by treaty, and which was further confirmed to us by re|peated promi&s;es from that court.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time that the earl of Bri&s;tol was authori&s;ed to proceed with that &s;pirit, which the offended dignity of our court required, and to bring Spain to a categorical and &s;atisfactory declaration, concerning her final intentions; yet if he per|ceived on her part any intention to di&s;avow or even to explain away this offen&s;ive tran&s;action, he was readily to accept it, and to afford to that court as hand&s;ome a retreat as po&s;&s;ible. The letter which con|veyed the&s;e in&s;tructions was written by Mr. Pitt, and dated on the 28th of July, a few days after the fatal memorial had been delivered by Mr. Bu&s;&s;y.</P>
<P>The earl of Bri&s;tol punctually obeyed tho&s;e orders. He found general Wall, the Spani&s;h mini&s;ter, much in cold blood, and in very equivocal di&s;po&s;itions. He heard with great patience the proper and energetic repre&s;entation that had been very ably made by the earl of Bri&s;tol. He applauded the king of Great Britain's magnanimity in not &s;uffering France as a tribunal, to be appealed to in his di&s;putes with Spain; and declared, that in the pro|po&s;ition which had been made with the con&s;ent of his court, things were not con&s;idered in that light; a&s;ked whether it could be imagined in Eng|land, that the Catholick king was &s;eeking to provoke us in our pre&s;ent mo&s;t flouri&s;hing and mo&s;t exalted &s;ituation, and after &s;uch a &s;eries of pro&s;perous events as no &s;ingle nation had ever met with? He valued, and reciprocally returned, our fre|quent profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip, and our de&s;ire of amicable adju&s;tment. But the&s;e favourable demon&s;trations were accompanied with &s;ome cir|cum&s;tances, that had a very menac|ing
<PB N="246" REF="264">
appearance. For, in the fir&s;t place, he declared, that at that time the utmo&s;t harmony &s;ub&s;i&s;ted be|tween the courts of France and Spain; that in con&s;equence of their perfect agreement, there was a mu|tual unre&s;erved communication of every &s;tep taken in their &s;everal ne|gotiations with England; that France had even offered to a&s;&s;i&s;t Spain, in ca&s;e the di&s;cu&s;&s;ions &s;he had with us &s;hould grow into a rupture; and that this offer was con&s;idered in a friendly light. Such an intimate union of a third power with one of the parties at war, forebodes no long duration to its friend&s;hip, or even to its neutrality with the other. If Spain ju&s;tified the proceedings of France, and owned her&s;elf concern|ed in them, it was but one, and that a &s;hort, &s;tep, to a junction with her.</P>
<P>As to the three matters in di&s;pute, the Spani&s;h mini&s;ter re&s;olutely ad|hered to them all; and as to the la&s;t (that of the logwood) he ob&s;erved, that Great Britain had offered them nothing, but what they had long &s;ince been tired of, treaty and negotiation; that this matter had been already fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed; and that on this head Spain had given the mo&s;t convincing proofs of her de&s;ire to be on the be&s;t terms with England; for in the beginning of this war, before England had grown terrible by her &s;ucce&s;&s;es, when their American governors had endeavoured to di&s;lodge the Eng|li&s;h from &s;ome new e&s;tabli&s;hments on the coa&s;t of Honduras, they had at the complaint of our court, in order to take away all cau&s;e of mi&s;|tru&s;t, ordered the governors to de|&s;i&s;t from &s;o ju&s;tifiable an enterprize. That on the offer of England on this occa&s;ion to &s;ettle matters in an amicable manner, they chearfully agreed to that method. But that &s;ix years had elap&s;ed without their receiving the lea&s;t &s;atisfaction. They even alledged that the Eng|li&s;h encroachments on their coa&s;ts in that time increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>In this manner the Spaniards vin|dicated the form and the matter of their proceeding: they &s;hewed no &s;ort of di&s;po&s;ition to relax from their claims; but at the &s;ame time they no longer in&s;i&s;ted on blending toge|ther the &s;everal di&s;cu&s;&s;ions; and they profe&s;&s;ed, in general, though not in very warm terms, a de&s;ire of continuing in amity with us. With regard to the matter in di&s;pute, the preten&s;ions of both powers &s;tood in this po&s;ture throughout this whole di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; except that they were urged with more or le&s;s a&s;perity, according to the fluctuating di&s;po&s;i|tion of the court of Spain, which &s;eemed to re&s;t upon no &s;ure and &s;et|tled principles. There were pro|bably two factions in her councils, who as they alternately prevailed, changed the language and counte|nance of the Spani&s;h mini&s;ter. However, for &s;ome time the a&s;pect of things continued on the whole to be rather favourable: and even an expre&s;s declaration was at length made, that Spain had been, at no time, more intent on cultivating a good corre&s;pondence with us. But &s;till the French intere&s;t &s;ilently gain|ed ground at Madrid; the confi|dental communications of that court with Spain; her affected moderation in the treaty; the dangerous great|ne&s;s of England: the common in|tere&s;t of the hou&s;e of Bourbon, every part of which mu&s;t &s;uffer, both in its dignity and &s;afety, by allowing the principal of its branches to be pruned to the quick; the&s;e points were urged with continual &s;ollici|tation;
<PB N="247" REF="265">
and they a&s;&s;ured the Spa|niards that even the &s;igning an al|liance between the &s;overeigns of the two nations, would intimidate Eng|land, already exhau&s;ted by the war, and apprehen&s;ive of lo&s;ing the va|luable commerce &s;he carried on with Spain.</P>
<P>The&s;e arguments and &s;ugge&s;tions at length prevailed, and a treaty was &s;igned between the two courts, the purpo&s;e of which was to pre|&s;erve from oppre&s;&s;ion and to main|tain the intere&s;ts of the hou&s;e of Bourbon. This alliance was of a nature the more dangerous, as it turned upon family not national in|tere&s;t, and becau&s;e not &s;tating ex|actly its objects, it might be made ju&s;t of what extent they plea&s;ed. We make no mention of any other treaty than this, of it&s;elf &s;ufficiently alarming, becau&s;e whatever &s;u&s;|picions may be entertained, there is no certainty that any other has been concluded between tho&s;e powers.</P>
<P>France had obtained in this trea|ty almo&s;t all that &s;he aimed at; by it &s;he entered into the clo&s;e&s;t connecti|on with Spain; this connection did not indeed &s;eem directly and of ne|ce&s;&s;ity to conclude a breach with Eng|land; it led to it however, almo&s;t inevitably. At fir&s;t the whole tran&s;|action was kept a profound &s;ecret; the inferiority of the marine of Spain, and the precariou&s;ne&s;s of their &s;upplies from America, in ca&s;e they came to a pre&s;ent rupture with England, obliged them to this tem|porary re&s;erve. France took care that this treaty &s;hould not tran&s;pire until the negotiation was broken off; and Spain, whil&s;t &s;he was under the&s;e apprehen&s;ions, exhibited tho&s;e occa&s;ional proofs of a pacific di&s;po|&s;ition, which we have ju&s;t now &s;een. But as &s;oon as France had lo&s;t all hopes of concluding the negotiation in the manner &s;he had wi&s;hed, and had failed in the u&s;e &s;he made of the intervention of the claims of Spain, &s;he circulated with great indu&s;try a report, that Spain would immediate|ly declare again&s;t Great Britain, in con&s;equence of a treaty lately con|cluded among the Bourbon courts.</P>
<P>England found that tho&s;e boats of the French were too confidently made, and too generally believed, to be altogether without foundation. In con&s;equence of the&s;e apprehen|&s;ions, orders were &s;ent to Spain, to demand in the mo&s;t moderate terms, but in a manner not to be evaded, a communication of this treaty, or at lea&s;t a di&s;avowal that it contained any thing to the prejudice of Great Britain. But before the&s;e orders could reach Spain, lord Bri&s;tol had him&s;elf received intelligence of the treaty, and of the hopes, which the French made no &s;ecret of their de|riving from that &s;ource. He there|fore thought him&s;elf under a nece&s;|&s;ity of de&s;iring &s;atisfaction from the Spani&s;h &s;ecretary of &s;tate concern|ing it.</P>
<P>Upon this application there ap|peared on a &s;udden &s;uch a change in the countenance, language, and &s;entiments of that mini&s;ter, as indi|cated but too fully the ju&s;tne&s;s of the &s;u&s;picions that were entertained. The Spani&s;h flota was now &s;afely arrived with a very rich cargo; the French arms had made a con&s;ider|able progre&s;s in the king's electoral dominions; the &s;ucce&s;s of the Im|perial arms was no le&s;s &s;triking; the rea&s;ons for their former &s;hew of moderation no longer exi&s;ted. They therefore gave a loo&s;e to tho&s;e movements which they had hitherto concealed. M. Wall, evading a
<PB N="248" REF="266">
direct an&s;wer, entered into a long and bitter complaint, not only of the treatment which Spain had re|ceived from us, but of the haughti|ne&s;s of our late proceedings with France; that it was time for them to open their eyes, and not to &s;uffer a neighbour, an ally, a relation, and a friend, any longer to run the ri&s;que of receiving &s;uch rigid laws as were pre&s;cribed by an in&s;ulting conqueror; that we were intoxicated with our &s;ucce&s;&s;es; and a continued &s;eries of victories had elated us &s;o far, as to make us reject the rea&s;onable con|ce&s;&s;ions offered by France. This re|fu&s;al made it evident, that our de|&s;ign in ruining the French power, was the more ea&s;ily to cru&s;h Spain; that we propo&s;ed entirely to cha&s;e the French from all their colonies in America, to have the ea&s;ier ta&s;k in &s;eizing on the Spani&s;h dominions in tho&s;e parts, thereby to &s;atisfy to the utmo&s;t our ambition, and to gratify our boundle&s;s thir&s;t of con|que&s;t; therefore he would him&s;elf be the man to advi&s;e the king of Spain, that &s;ince his dominions were to be overwhelmed, at lea&s;t that they &s;hould be &s;eized with arms in his &s;ubjects hands, and not to con|tinue the pa&s;&s;ive victim he had hitherto appeared in the eyes of the world.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, though a&s;toni&s;hed at &s;o extraordinary a change of &s;tile, replied with cool|ne&s;s to the invectives, and with firm|ne&s;s to the menaces of the Spani&s;h mini&s;ter; he obviated the objec|tions which had been made, and &s;upported our preten&s;ions; after an&s;wering in the be&s;t manner to what M. Wall had urged, he return|ed to his fir&s;t demand, an explanation concerning the treaty; as often as a direct an&s;wer was evaded, the &s;ame que&s;tion was again put; and at length the only reply was, that the king of Spain had thought proper to <HI>renew his family compacts;</HI> and then Mr. Wall, as if he had gone farther than he was authori&s;ed, &s;ud|denly turned the di&s;cour&s;e, and no farther &s;atisfaction could be ob|tained.</P>
<P>This revolution in the appear|ances of things in Spain, was too in|tere&s;ting not to be immediately com|municated. Our mini&s;try &s;aw evi|dently, that the moderation they had hitherto di&s;played, might be at|tributed to fear, and that the lan|guage of the court of Spain would permit no doubt of their ho&s;tile intentions. Orders were therefore given to the earl of Bri&s;tol, con|formable to the dignity of the na|tion, and the ju&s;tice of our claim. He was ordered to renew his in|&s;tances concerning the treaty; to demand an explanation with a proper firmne&s;s, but without the mixture of any thing which might irritate; and to &s;ignify, that a pe|remptory refu&s;al to communicate the treaty, or to di&s;avow an inten|tion to take part with our enemies, would be con&s;idered as an aggre&s;|&s;ion on the part of Spain, and an ab&s;olute declaration of war.</P>
<P>Things were now brought to a &s;ingle and preci&s;e point. The demand was made in the terms of the order. Then it was that the pride of Spain entirely threw off the remainder of that ma&s;k, which her policy had per&s;uaded her to a&s;&s;ume; the &s;ecretary, M. Wall, replied, <Q>&startq;That the &s;pirit of haughtine&s;s and of di&s;cord, which dic|tated <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 10th.</NOTE> this incon&s;iderate &s;tep, and which for the misfortune of mankind &s;till reigns &s;o much in
<PB N="249" REF="267">
the Briti&s;h government, is what has made the declaration of war, and attacked the King's dignity; and that the Earl of Bri&s;tol might return when and in what man|ner was convenient to him.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>The Earl of Bri&s;tol parted from Madrid the 17th of December; and thus was brought on a rupture which has prodigiou&s;ly extended the operations, and con&s;equently the mi&s;eries of war, and threatens to protract them to a very long duration. Europe, unfortunately found her&s;elf plunged into the gulph of a new war, at the time &s;he hoped to emerge from the old one, and by the very means which were u&s;ed to draw her out of it. A point of honour alone &s;eemed to have been the la&s;t and immediate cau&s;e of the breach; but whoever has diligently attended to the Spa|ni&s;h affairs from the memorial pre|&s;ented by Bu&s;&s;y to the final an&s;wer delivered by Wall, will &s;ee that the motives were, however ill under|&s;tood, of a much more &s;erious and important nature.</P>
<P>As the two powers had now come to extremities, and the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador had departed from Ma|drid, the Spani&s;h mini&s;ter al&s;o quit|ted London; but before his de|parture he left a paper, in the na|ture of a manife&s;to, of very little importance in point of argument, but filled with invectives, charging the war on the haughtine&s;s of the late Engli&s;h mini&s;ter, and on the little re&s;pect with which his court had been treated, both during the admini&s;tration of that mini&s;ter, and &s;ince his re&s;ignation. That had the purport of the treaty been de&s;ired in a manner le&s;s offen&s;ive to the dignity of his ma&s;ter, it might as ea&s;ily have been obtained, as it could have been ju&s;tified; for the treaty, which was believed to have been &s;igned on the 15th of Augu&s;t, contained only a reciprocal gua|ranty of the dominions of the &s;e|veral branches of the hou&s;e of Bourbon, but with this particu|lar re&s;triction, that it &s;hould on|ly extend to the dominions which &s;hall remain to France after the pre&s;ent war.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be remarked that, this paper, whil&s;t it pretends to &s;et forth the purport of a treaty dated the 15th of Augu&s;t, does not deny the exi&s;tence of any other treaty, which might more offen&s;ively con|cern the intere&s;t of Great Britain. It was however an&s;wered in every article with the utmo&s;t moderation, per&s;picuity and force, in a memorial of lord Egremont. Here we clo&s;e the Spani&s;h tran&s;action; as this is the whole of what belongs proper|ly to the year we treat of. All that remains for us to do, is to touch upon the affairs of the Ea&s;t Indies and America.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. <HI>Blockade of Pondicherry. Di&s;tre&s;s of the French. Fleet di&s;per&s;ed in a &s;torm. Fleet returns. Town &s;urrenders. Mabie taken. Enterpri&s;es of Mr. Law. Mogul's army defeated by Major Carnac. Nabob of Bengal depo&s;ed. Coa&s;t of Sumatra ravaged by the count d' E&s;taing. Dominica taken by lord Rollo and Sir James Douglas.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AFTER the defeat of the French near Wandewa&s;h, the taking of the city of Arcot, and the reduction of the fortre&s;&s;es of Chitteput and Carrical, Pondicherry was the only &s;pace of con&s;equence which remained to our enemies in India. This town, beautifully built, &s;trongly fortified, and four leagues in circuit, &s;eemed rather the capital of a kingdom, than a trading e&s;tabli&s;hment. It is &s;ituated on the coa&s;t of Malabar, about for|ty miles from our &s;ettlement at Ma|dra&s;s, which in the days of its pro&s;perity it rivalled, if not exceed|ed in trade, opulence and &s;plendor; and it &s;till remained the depo&s;itory of whatever wealth was left to the French, after the rever&s;e of their fortune in war.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the fortre&s;&s;es adjacent to this important place had been reduced, and the inland country brought perfectly to our intere&s;ts by the total expul&s;ion of the French, the blockade of Pondicherry was commenced by the land forces un|der colonel Coote, and the marine under admiral Stevens. A regular &s;iege was at that time impracticable on account of the periodical rains, which were daily expected; and even under more favourable cir|cum&s;tances it would have proved a ta&s;k of infinite difficulty to attempt by any army that could be &s;up|ported in India, the taking of a place &s;o &s;trongly fortified, defended by a good garri&s;on, and by an officer able and re&s;olute, and who&s;e pride and ob&s;tinacy, &s;o prejudicial on all other occa&s;ions, would have made him, as in effect they did make him, per&s;evere to the very la&s;t moment, in the defence of the la&s;t &s;take, which the French had left in India.</P>
<P>The blockade being therefore cho&s;en as the mo&s;t eligible for the time, was continued with the be&s;t di&s;po&s;itions, and the mo&s;t extraordi|nary patience on both &s;ides, for full &s;even months. In this time the garri|&s;on and inhabitants &s;uffered &s;orely by famine. Col. Coote, in order to aug|ment their di&s;tre&s;s, erected bat|teries at a di&s;tance, not with a view of ruining the walls, but to harra&s;s the enemy by an encrea&s;e of garri&s;on duty.</P>
<P>At length when the weather ap|peared &s;ettled, four batteries were rai&s;ed at &s;ome di&s;tance to enfilade the &s;treets of Pondicherry, whil&s;t others were advanced nearer in or|der to play upon the works. The&s;e operations, though the &s;iege was not yet formally undertaken, com|menced on the 26th of November, 1760, but as the &s;ea&s;on of the rains and winds was not yet quite over, much was &s;uffered from &s;torms, which ruined the batteries and ap|proaches. They were however al|ways repaired with the utmo&s;t alacri|ty and &s;peed, and the &s;iege &s;uffered no intermi&s;&s;ion. So that the be&s;ieged, who eagerly expected the arrival of their fleet to their relief, were re|duced
<PB N="251" REF="269">
to the mo&s;t extreme di&s;tre&s;s. They lived on camels, elephants, dogs, and cats. The extreme &s;car|city and dearne&s;s even of this wretched provi&s;ion, increa&s;ed their mi&s;ery. Sixteen roupies (half crowns) had been paid for the fle&s;h of a dog.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this di&s;tre&s;s their hopes were &s;uddenly revived, and tho&s;e of the be&s;iegers, notwith&s;tand|ing the progre&s;s they had made, almo&s;t totally depre&s;&s;ed. On the fir&s;t of January 1761, one of tho&s;e terrible &s;torms, &s;o frequent in the Indian &s;ea, and &s;o ruinous, drove the Engli&s;h &s;quadron from before Pondicherry. Two &s;hips of the line were wrecked, and their crews, with the exception of two or three men, entirely peri&s;hed. Two others of the &s;ame cla&s;s were driven a&s;hore, and beat to pieces. The men fortu|nately e&s;caped. The real damage which our fleet &s;u&s;tained on this oc|ca&s;ion, together with the idea of a far greater, &s;ugge&s;ted by their own de&s;ires, and ju&s;tified by the violence of the &s;torm, elevated to the highe&s;t pitch the &s;pirits of the garri&s;on, &s;unk by di&s;ea&s;e, famine, fatigue, and an uninterrupted train of ad|ver&s;e fortune. General Lally &s;eeing the port clear, &s;ent an expre&s;s without delay to the French agent in the neighbouring neutral &s;ettle|ments, that this was the time to throw in &s;uccours; he &s;eemed &s;an|guine and full of vigour. The let|ter, which was intercepted, is print|ed below <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Tran&s;lation of an intercepted letter from general Lally to M. Raymond, French re&s;ident at Pullicat, dated Pondicherry the 2d of January 1761.</P>
<Q>	
<P>Mr. RAYMOND,</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h &s;quadron is no more, Sir; out of the twelve &s;hips they had in our road, &s;even are lo&s;t, crews and all; the four others di&s;ma&s;ted; and it appears there is no more than one frigate that hath e&s;caped; therefore don't lo&s;e an in&s;tant to &s;end us chelingoes upon chelingoes loaded with rice; the Dutch have nothing to fear now; be&s;ides (according to the law of nations) they are only to &s;end us no provi&s;ions them&s;elves, and we are no more blocked up by &s;ea.</P>
<P>The &s;aving of Pondicherry hath been in your power once already; if you mi&s;s the pre&s;ent opportunity, it will be entirely your fault; do not forget al&s;o &s;ome &s;mall chelingoes: offer great rewards: I expect &s;eventeen thou&s;and Morattoes within the&s;e four days. In &s;hort, ri&s;que all, attempt all, force all, and &s;end us &s;ome rice, &s;hould it be but half a gar&s;e at a time. Signed, LALLY.</P></Q></NOTE>, as it may tend to fur|ni&s;h &s;ome idea of the character of this &s;ingular man.</P>
<P>But admiral Stevens, and tho&s;e who commanded under him, exert|ing them&s;elves with unparalleled diligence and celerity, appeared again before Pondicherry in le&s;s than four days after the &s;torm, with eleven &s;hips of the line and one fri|gate, and the blockade was as com|pleat as ever. No &s;uccours had been thrown in, and admiral Stevens in order to prevent the ill impre&s;&s;ion which the late di&s;a&s;ter might have occa&s;ioned, &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the neighbouring Dutch and Dani&s;h &s;et|tlements, of the good condition and &s;trength of the remainder of his fleet, and a&s;&s;ured them he would make prize of &s;uch ve&s;&s;els as he found infringing the neutrality by attempting to &s;upply the enemy.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="270">
Notwith&s;tanding this mortifying di&s;appointment, M. Lally made no propo&s;al to &s;urrender. The &s;iege was carried on with redoubled ala|crity; and at length a large battery being advanced within four hundred and fifty yards of the rampart, a breach being effected, and not more than one day's provi&s;ion of any kind remaining, a &s;ignal was made for a ce&s;&s;ation; the principal of the Je|&s;uits, together with two civilians came out, and offered terms of ca|pitulation. The governor pre&s;erv|ing all his haughtine&s;s, which nei|ther his errors nor misfortunes could in the lea&s;t abate, declined to offer any terms; he &s;ent out a paper full of invec|tives <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 15th.</NOTE> again&s;t the Engli&s;h, for the breach of treaties relative to India; he alledged that tho&s;e breaches di&s;|qualified him from propo&s;ing any terms; and in con&s;equence he ra|ther &s;uffered our troops to take po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place, than formally &s;urrendered it. As the governor re|fu&s;ed to capitulate, the propo&s;al of the inhabitants was little regarded, and the city of Pondicherry, with a garri&s;on of about fourteen hundred European &s;oldiers, a va&s;t quantity of military &s;tores, and great riches; was given up at di&s;cretion to our victorious arms.</P>
<P>Nothing can be &s;aid too highly of the conduct, per&s;everance, and unanimity of the land and &s;ea &s;er|vices during a tedious &s;iege and blockade of eight months, in a climate &s;o unfavourable to all mili|tary operations. Colonel Coote gave the final blow to the French power in India; he was now undi&s;|puted ma&s;ter of the rich coa&s;t of Coromandel; the French power was wholly extirpated; the neutral na|tions were contemptible; the prin|ces of the country con&s;idered us with an aweful regard, and nothing but a little French &s;ettlement on the coa&s;t of Malabar, called Mahie, (and which was &s;oon after reduced) oppo&s;ed our commanding the whole trade of the va&s;t penin&s;ula of India from the Ganges to the Indies, the mo&s;t exten&s;ive and profitable &s;phere of commerce in the world.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t every thing was giving way to our arms in the &s;outhern parts of this penin&s;ula, the affairs of France, which in Bengal had been to all appearance totally &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed, ro&s;e up again for a mo|ment from a quarter, and in a manner, which was little expected. After the taking of Chandenagore by admiral Wat&s;on in the year 1757, Mr. Law, (nephew to that Law who had made him&s;elf &s;o well known by the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi Scheme) put him&s;elf at the head of a party of French fugitives, which was augmented from time to time to about two hundred men. With this &s;mall party he threw him&s;elf into the heart of the country, and joining him&s;elf &s;ometimes to one, &s;ometimes to another of the na|tive princes, as his intere&s;t led him; he rendered him&s;elf con&s;ider|able by &s;everal &s;triking &s;ervices, and &s;upported the credit of his little corps with a very high reputation.</P>
<P>The Great Mogul having &s;ome time &s;ince been depo&s;ed by an ir|ruption of the Marattas, and dying &s;oon after, one of his &s;ons, Sha Zaddah, a&s;&s;umed the title, and was &s;upported by &s;ome of the provinces of that exten&s;ive and di&s;united em|pire; he was oppo&s;ed by others; and though he was at the head of a royal army of his native &s;ubjects, &s;uch is the &s;tate of the military in that part of the world, that he con|&s;idered
<PB N="253" REF="271">
an handful of European fu|gitives, as an acqui&s;ition of the greate&s;t importance, and &s;uch as might turn the ballance again&s;t any weight of Indians, which might be thrown into the oppo&s;ite &s;cale. In fact, it was to Mr. Law he at|tributed the reduction of &s;everal con&s;iderable provinces to his obe|dience.</P>
<P>Elated with the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es, Law per&s;uaded him to turn his arms again&s;t Bengal, which had not ac|knowledged him; it was a rich and flouri&s;hing country, and the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, would undoubtedly contribute more than all the re&s;t to &s;et him on the throne of the Mo|guls. Here, unfortunately for him the evil genius of Law impelled him to encounter again with tho&s;e arms, by which the intere&s;t of his country had been before ruined in this part of the world, and which indeed were tho&s;e only, from which he had a great deal to fear. Sha Zaddah entered the kingdom of Bengal at the head of an army of 80,000 In|dians, and &s;omething more than 200 French.</P>
<P>The French &s;upport was more prejudicial to his title in the eyes of the Engli&s;h, than any other ob|jection, and as they were now be|come the arbiters of crowns in the Ea&s;t, they joined the Nabob of Bengal to oppo&s;e his progre&s;s. About 20,000 blacks &s;upported by 500 Engli&s;h &s;oldiers, formed the army again&s;t him. A major (major Carnac) commanded that body, which engaged, and totally routed an army of four&s;core thou&s;and men, commanded by the Mogul in per|&s;on. That prince was taken pri|&s;oner; Mr, Law was al&s;o taken, and the party of French adven|tures di&s;per&s;ed for ever. It is not yet known with certainty, in what manner they mean to di&s;po&s;e of their captive monarch. It was &s;ome heightening to the &s;atisfaction of this great event, that it happen|ed on the &s;ame day in which the French agreed to the &s;urrender of Pondicherry.</P>
<P>A little before this, Jaffier Ali Cawn, the Nabob who, in 1757, had been placed in that dignity by general Clive, notwith&s;tanding the terrifying example of his predece&s;|&s;or, by his weakne&s;s and mis|government, drew on him&s;elf the hatred of his &s;ubjects, and lo&s;t the protection of the Engli&s;h. But as his ambition was the feeble&s;t of his pa&s;&s;ions, he con&s;ented quietly to quit the throne. The revolution was effected without blood&s;hed, his &s;on|in-law was appointed in his room; and as the whole tran&s;action was with the con&s;ent and co-operation of the Engli&s;h governor Van&s;ittart, the old privileges of the company were confirmed, and new were ac|quired: the Engli&s;h in Bengal were become nece&s;&s;ary to the government of that country, and every change produces &s;omething to their advan|tage.</P>
<P>It is certain, that the period of this war in the Ea&s;t Indies, has been marked by as many &s;triking events, uncommon circum&s;tances, and &s;ingular rever&s;es of fortune, as any that have happened from the time of our knowledge of this part of the world. We are &s;orry that the accounts we have hitherto had are &s;o broken and imperfect, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to treat of them in a manner in the lea&s;t &s;uitable to their dignity and importance. Here we only touch them &s;lightly.</P>
<P>It can hardly be &s;aid, that this &s;eries of pro&s;perity was interrupted
<PB N="254" REF="272">
by the &s;ucce&s;sful attempts of the count d'E&s;taign. This lively ad|venturer, with the command of no more than two ordinary frigates, had in October 1759, taken and de&s;troyed the Engli&s;h &s;ettlement of Bender-Aba&s;&s;i, on the Per&s;iangulph; he then &s;truck over to the i&s;land of Sumatra, where we carry on our mo&s;t con&s;iderable commerce in pep|per; and before the end of the fol|lowing April, reduced Bencoolen, the principal &s;ettlement, and all the re&s;t of our forts and factories on that i&s;land, which made a defence altogether as unworthy of the re&s;t of our conduct in India, as that of the count d'E&s;taign was &s;uperior to the efforts of his countrymen in that quarter. This bold adventurer, however, could not derive &s;o much honour from the vigour of his en|terprize, as di&s;grace from having made them again&s;t the mo&s;t &s;acred law of arms: if what is &s;aid is true, that he was at the very time a pri&s;oner upon parole.</P>
<P>In America the i&s;land of Domi|nica, one of tho&s;e i&s;lands called Neutral, but which the French had fortified and &s;ettled, was reduced by a &s;mall armament under lord Rollo and Sir James Douglas. North America was perfectly quiet|ed by a peace with the Cherokees. Colonel Grant reduced them to this nece&s;&s;ity, by penetrating with great courage and per&s;everance into their country, and de&s;troying fifteen of their towns, and almo&s;t their whole harve&s;t.</P>
