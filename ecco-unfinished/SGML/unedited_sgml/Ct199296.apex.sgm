<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Hi&s;tory of this <HI>Beautiful Lady,</HI> is to &s;peak for it&s;elf: If it is not as Beautiful as the Lady her&s;elf is reported to be; if it is not as diverting as the Reader can de&s;ire, and much more than he can rea&s;onably expect; and if all the mo&s;t diverting Parts of it are not a|dapted to the In&s;truction and Improvement of the Reader, the <HI>Relator &s;ays,</HI> it mu&s;t be from the Defect of his Performance; dre&s;&s;ing up the Story in wor&s;e Cloaths than the <HI>Lady,</HI> who&s;e Words he &s;peaks, prepar'd it for the World.</P>
<P>He takes the Liberty to &s;ay, that this <HI>Story</HI> differs from mo&s;t of the modern Performances of this Kind, tho' &s;ome of them have met with a very good Reception in the World: <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> It differs from them in this great and e&s;&s;ential Article, <HI>Namely,</HI> that the Foundation of this<HI><PB REF="4"></HI>is laid in Truth of <HI>Fact;</HI> and &s;o the Work is not a Story, but a Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The Scene is laid &s;o near the Place where the main Part of it was tran&s;acted, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to conceal Names and Per&s;ons; le&s;t what cannot be yet entirely forgot in that Part of the Town, &s;hou'd be remember'd, and the Facts trac'd back too plainly, by the many People yet living, who wou'd know the Per&s;ons by the Particulars.</P>
<P>It is not always nece&s;&s;ary that the Names of Per&s;ons &s;hou'd be di&s;cover'd, tho' the Hi&s;tory may be many Ways u&s;eful; and if we &s;hou'd be always oblig'd to name the Per&s;ons, or not to relate the Story, the Con&s;equence might be only this, that many a plea&s;ant and delightful Hi&s;tory wou'd be buried in the Dark, and the World be depriv'd both of the Plea&s;ure and the Profit of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Writer &s;ays,</HI> He was particularly ac|quainted with this Lady's fir&s;t Husband, <HI>the Brewer,</HI> and with his Father; and al&s;o, with his bad Circum&s;tances; and knows that fir&s;t Part of the Story to be Truth.</P>
<P>This may, he hopes, be a Pledge for the Credit of the re&s;t, tho' the latter Part of her Hi&s;tory lay abroad, and cou'd not &s;o well be vouch'd as the Fir&s;t; yet, as &s;he has told it her|&s;elf, we have the le&s;s Rea&s;on to que&s;tion the Truth of that Part al&s;o.</P>
<P>In the Manner &s;he has told the Story, it is evident &s;he does not in&s;i&s;t upon her Ju&s;tification<HI><PB REF="5"></HI>in any one Part of it; much le&s;s does &s;he recom|mend her Conduct, or indeed, any Part of it, except her Repentance to our Imitation: On the contrary, &s;he makes frequent Excur&s;ions, in a ju&s;t cen&s;uring and condemning her own Practice: How often does &s;he approach her&s;elf in the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate Manner; and guide us to ju&s;t Re|flections in the like Ca&s;es?</P>
<P>It is true, She met with unexpected Succe&s;s in all her wicked Cour&s;es; but even in the high|e&s;t Elevations of her Pro&s;perity, &s;he makes fre|quent Acknowledgments, that the Plea&s;ure of her Wickedne&s;s was not worth the Repentance; and that all the Satisfaction &s;he had, all the Joy in the View of her Pro&s;perity, no, nor all the Wealth &s;he rowl'd in; the Gayety of her Ap|pearance; the Equipages, and the Honours, &s;he was attended with, cou'd quiet her Mind, a|bate the Reproaches of her Con&s;cience, or pro|cure her an Hour's Sleep, when ju&s;t Reflections kept her waking.</P>
<P>The noble Inferences that are drawn from this one Part, are worth all the re&s;t of the Story, and abundantly ju&s;tify (as they are the profe&s;s'd De&s;ign of) the Publication.</P>
<P>If there are any Parts in her Story, which being oblig'd to relate a wicked Action, &s;eem to de&s;cribe it too plainly, <HI>the Writer &s;ays,</HI> all imaginable Care has been taken to keep clear of Indecencies, and immode&s;t Expre&s;&s;ions; and 'tis hop'd you will find nothing to prompt a vicious<HI><PB REF="6"></HI>Mind, but every-where much to di&s;courage and expo&s;e it.</P>
<P>Scenes of Crime can &s;carce be repre&s;ented in &s;uch a Manner, but &s;ome may make a criminal U&s;e of them; but when Vice is painted in its Low-priz'd Colours, 'tis not to make People in love with it, but to expo&s;e it; and if the Reader makes a wrong U&s;e of the Figures, the Wicked|ne&s;s is his own.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, the Advantages of the pre&s;ent Work are &s;o great, and the virtuous Rea|der has room for &s;o much Improvement, that we make no Que&s;tion, the Story, however meanly told, will find a Pa&s;&s;age to his be&s;t Hours; and be read both with Profit and Delight.</P>

<HEAD><HI>ROXANA:</HI> OR, THE FORTUNATE MISTRESS.</HEAD>
<P>I Was born, as my Friends told me, at the City of <HI>Poictiers,</HI> in the Province, or County of <HI>Poictou,</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> from whence I was brought to <HI>England</HI> by my Parents, who fled for their Religion about the Year 1683, when the Prote&s;|tants were bani&s;hed from <HI>France</HI> by the Cruelty of their Per&s;ecutors.</P>
<P>I, who knew little or nothing of what I was brought over hither for, was well enough plea&s;ed with being here; <HI>London,</HI> a large and gay City, took with me mighty well, who, from my being a Child, loved a Crowd, and to &s;ee a great-many fine Folks.</P>
<P>I retained nothing of <HI>France,</HI> but the Language: My Father and Mother being People of better Fa&s;hion, than ordinarily the People called Refugees at that Time were; and having fled early, while it was ea&s;y to &s;e|ure their Effects, had, before their coming over, re|mitted
<PB N="10" REF="8">
con&s;iderable Sums of Money, or, as I remem|ber, a con&s;iderable Value in <HI>French</HI> Brandy, Paper, and other Goods; and the&s;e &s;elling very much to Advan|tage here, my Father was in very good Circum&s;tances at his coming over, &s;o that he was far from applying to the re&s;t of our Nation that were here, for Counte|nance and Relief: On the contrary, he had his Door continually throng'd with mi&s;erable Objects of the Poor &s;tarving Creatures, who at that Time fled hither for Shelter on Account of Con&s;cience, or &s;omething el&s;e.</P>
<P>I have indeed, heard my Father &s;ay, That he was pe&s;ter'd with a great many of tho&s;e, who, for any Re|ligion they had, might even have &s;tay'd where they were, but who flock'd over hither in Droves, for what they call in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> a Lively hood; hearing with what open Arms the Refugees were received in <HI>England,</HI> and how they &s;ell readily into Bu&s;ine&s;s, being by the chari|table A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the People of <HI>London,</HI> encouraged to Work in their Manufactures, in <HI>Spittle-fields, Canter|bury,</HI> and other Places; and that they had a much bet|ter Price for their Work, than in <HI>France,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>My Father, I &s;ay, told me, That he was more pe&s;|ter'd with the Clamours of the&s;e People, than of tho&s;e who were truly Refugees, and fled in Di&s;tre&s;s, meerly for Con&s;cience.</P>
<P>I was about ten Years old when I was brought over hither, where, as I have &s;aid, my Father liv'd in very good Circum&s;tances, and died in about eleven Years more; in which Time, as I had accompli&s;h'd my&s;elf for the &s;ociable Part of the World, &s;o I had acquainted my&s;elf with &s;ome of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Neighbours, as is the Cu&s;tom in <HI>London;</HI> and as, while I was young, I had pick'd up three or four Play-fellows and Companions, &s;uitable to my Years; &s;o as we grew bigger, we learnt to call one another Intimates and Friends; and this for|warded very much the fini&s;hing me for Conver&s;ation, and the World.</P>
<P>I went to <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Schools, and being young, I learnt the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue perfectly well, with all the Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> young Women; &s;o that I retained no|thing
<PB N="11" REF="9">
of the <HI>French,</HI> but the Speech; nor did I &s;o much as keep any Remains of the <HI>French</HI> Language tagg'd to my Way of Speaking, as mo&s;t Foreigners do, but &s;poke what we call Natural <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> as if I had been born here.</P>
<P>Being to give my own Character, I mu&s;t be excus'd to give it as impartially as po&s;&s;ible, and as if I was &s;peaking of another Per&s;on; and the Sequel will lead you to judge whether I flatter my &s;elf or no.</P>
<P>I was (&s;peaking of my&s;elf as about fourteen Years of Age) tall, and very well made; &s;harp as a Hawk in Matters of common Knowledge; quick and &s;mart in Di&s;cour&s;e; apt to be &s;atyrical; full of Repartee, and a little too forward in Conver&s;ation; or, as we call it in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> Bold, though perfectly Mode&s;t in my Behavi|our. Being <HI>French</HI> born, I danced, as &s;ome &s;ay, natu|rally, loved it extreamly, and &s;ung well al&s;o, and &s;o well, that, as you will hear, it was afterwards &s;ome Advantage to me: With all the&s;e Things, I wanted neither Wit, Beauty, or Money. In this Manner I &s;et out into the World, having all the Advantages that any young Woman cou'd de&s;ire, to recommend me to others, and form a Pro&s;pect of happy Living to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>At about fifteen Years of Age, my Father gave me as he called it in <HI>French,</HI> 25000 Li$res, that is to &s;ay, two thou&s;and Pounds Portion, and married me to an eminent Brewer in the City; <HI>Pardon me if I conceal his Name, for though he was the Foundation of my Ruin, I cannot take &s;o &s;evere a Revenge upon him.</HI></P>
<P>With this Thing called a Husband, I lived eight Years in good Fa&s;hion, and for &s;ome Part of the Time, kept a Coach, that is to &s;ay, a Kind of mock Coach; for all the Week the Hor&s;es were kept at Work in the Dray-carts, but on Sunday I had the Privilege to go abroad in my Chariot, either to Church, or other|ways, as my Husband and I could agree about it; which, by the way, was not very often: But of that hereafter.</P>
<P>Before I proceed in the Hi&s;tory of the marry'd Part
<PB N="12" REF="10">
of my Life, you mu&s;t allow me to give as impartial an Account of my Husband, as I have done of my &s;elf: He was a jolly, hand&s;ome Fellow, as any Woman need wi&s;h for a Companion; tall and well made; rather a little too large, but not &s;o as to be ungenteel; he dan|ced well, which, I think, was the fir&s;t Thing that brought us together: He had an old Father, who ma|naged the Bu&s;ine&s;s carefully, &s;o that he had little of that Part lay on him, but now and then to appear, and &s;how him&s;elf; and he took the Advantage of it, for he troubled him&s;elf very little about it, but went abroad, kept Company, hunted much, and loved it exceedingly.</P>
<P>After I have told you that he was a hand&s;ome Man, and a good Sport&s;man, I have, indeed, &s;aid all; and unhappy was I, like other young People of our Sex, I cho&s;e him for being a hand&s;ome, jolly Fellow, as I have &s;aid; for he was otherwi&s;e a weak, empty-head|ed, untaught Creature, as any Woman could ever de|&s;ire to be coupled with: And here I mu&s;t take the Li|berty, whatever I have to reproach my&s;elf with in my after Conduct, to turn to my Fellow-Creatures, the young Ladies of this Country, and &s;peak to them, by Way of Precaution, If you have any Regard to your future Happine&s;s; any View of living comfortably with a Husband; any Hope of pre&s;erving your Fortunes, or re&s;toring them after any Di&s;a&s;ter; Never, Ladies, mar|ry a Fool; any Husband rather than a Fool; with &s;ome other Husbands you may be unhappy, but with a Fool you will be mi&s;erable; with another Husband you <HI>may,</HI> I &s;ay, be unhappy, but with a Fool you <HI>mu&s;t;</HI> nay, if he would, he cannot make you ea&s;y; every Thing he does is &s;o awkard, every Thing he &s;ays is &s;o empty, a Woman of any Sen&s;e cannot but be &s;urfeited, and &s;ick of him twenty Times a Day: What is more &s;hocking, than for a Woman to bring a hand&s;ome, comely Fellow of a Husband, into Company, and then be obliged to blu&s;h for him every Time &s;he hears him &s;peak? To hear other Gentlemen talk Sen&s;e, and he able to &s;ay nothing? And &s;o look like a Fool, or,
<PB N="13" REF="11">
which is wor&s;e, hear him talk Non&s;en&s;e, and laugh'd at for a Fool.</P>
<P>In the next Place, there are &s;o many Sorts of Fools, &s;uch an infinite Variety of Fools, and &s;o hard it is to know the wor&s;t of the Kind, that I am obliged to &s;ay, no Fool, Ladies, at all, no kind of Fool, whether a mad Fool, or a &s;ober Fool, a wi&s;e Fool, or a &s;illy Fool; take any Thing but a Fool; nay, be any thing, be even an old Maid, the wor&s;t of Nature's Cur&s;es, ra|ther than take up with a Fool.</P>
<P>But to leave this a while, for I &s;hall have Occa&s;ion to &s;peak of it again; my Ca&s;e was particularly hard, for I had a Variety of fooli&s;h Things complicated in this unhappy Match.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> and which, I confe&s;s, is very un&s;ufferable, he was a conceited Fool. <HI>Tout Opiniatre,</HI> every Thing he &s;aid, was right, was be&s;t, and was to the Purpo&s;e, whoever was in Company, and whatever was advanced by others, though with the greate&s;t Mode&s;ty imagina|ble; and yet when he came to defend what he had &s;aid, by Argument and Rea&s;on, he would do it &s;o weakly, &s;o emptily, and &s;o nothing to the Purpo&s;e, that it was enough to make any Body that heard him, &s;ick and a&s;hamed of him.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> he was po&s;itive and ob&s;tinate, and the mo&s;t po&s;itive in the mo&s;t &s;imple and incon&s;9&s;tent Things, &s;uch as were intollerable to bear.</P>
<P>The&s;e two Articles, if there had been no more, qualified him to be a mo&s;t unbearable Creature for a Husband; and &s;o it may be &s;uppo&s;ed at fir&s;t Sight, what a kind of Life I led with him: However, I did as well as I could, and held my Tongue, which was the only Victory I gained over him; for when he would talk after his own empty rattling Way with me, and I would not an&s;wer, or enter into Di&s;cour&s;e with him on the Point he was upon, he would ri&s;e up in the greate&s;t Pa&s;&s;ion imaginable, and go away; which was the cheape&s;t Way I had to be delivered.</P>
<P>I could enlarge here much, upon the Method I took to make my Life pa&s;&s;able and ea&s;y with the mo&s;t in|corrigible
<PB N="14" REF="12">
Temper in the World; but it is too long, and the Articles too trifling: I &s;hall mention &s;ome of them as the Circum&s;tances I am to relate, &s;hall nece&s;&s;a|rily bring them in.</P>
<P>After I had been married about four Years, my own Father died, my Mother having been dead before. He liked my Match &s;o ill, and &s;aw &s;o little Room to to be &s;atisfy'd with the Conduct of my Husband, that though he left me 5000 Livres, and more at his Death, yet he left it in the Hands of my Elder Brother, who running on too ra&s;hly in his Adventures, as a Mer|chant, failed, and lo&s;t not only what he had, but what he had for me too; as you &s;hall hear pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>Thus I lo&s;t the la&s;t Gift of my Father's Bounty by having a Husband not fit to be tru&s;ted with it; there's one of the Benefits of marrying a Fool.</P>
<P>Within two Years after my own Father's Death, my Husband's Father al&s;o died, and, as I thought, left him a con&s;iderable Addition to his E&s;tate, the whole Trade of the Brewhou&s;e, which was a very good one, being now his own.</P>
<P>But this Addition to his Stock was his Ruin, for he had no Genius to Bu&s;ine&s;s; he had no Knowledge of his Accounts; he bu&s;tled a little about it indeed, at fir&s;t, and put on a Face of Bu&s;ine&s;s, but he &s;oon grew &s;lack; it was below him to in&s;pect his Books, he com|mitted all that to his Clerks and Book keepers; and while he &s;ound Money in Ca&s;h to pay the Malt-man, and the Exci&s;e, and put &s;ome in his Pocket, he was perfectly ea&s;y and indolent, let the main Chance go how it would.</P>
<P>I fore&s;aw the Con&s;equence of this, and attempted &s;e|veral Times to per&s;wade him to apply him&s;elf to his Bu&s;ine&s;s; I put him in Mind how his Cu&s;tomers com|plained of the Neglect of his Servants on one Hand, and how abundance broke in his Debt, on the other Hand, for want of the Clerk's Care to &s;ecure him, and the like; but he thru&s;t me by; either with hard Words, or fraudulently, with repre&s;enting the Ca&s;es otherwi&s;e than they were.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="13">
However, to cut &s;hort a dull Story, which ought not to be long, he began to find his Trade &s;unk, his Stock declined, and that, in &s;hort, he could not carry on his Bu&s;ine&s;s, and once or twice his Brewing Uten|&s;ils were extended for the Exci&s;e; and the la&s;t Time he was put to great Extremities to clear them.</P>
<P>This alarm'd him, and he re&s;olved to lay down his Trade; which, indeed, I was not &s;orry for; fore&s;ee|ing that if he did not lay it down in Time, he would be forced to do it another Way, namely, as a Bankrupt. Al&s;o I was willing he &s;hould draw out while he had &s;omething left, le&s;t I &s;hould come to be &s;tript at Home, and be turned out of Doors with my Children; for I had now five Children by him; the only Work (per|haps) that Fools are good for.</P>
<P>I thought my&s;elf happy when he got another Man to take his Brew hou&s;e clear off his Hands; for pay|ing down a large Sum of Money, my Husband found him&s;elf a clear Man, all his Debts paid, and with be|tween two and three thou&s;and Pounds in his Pocket; and being now obliged to remove from the Brewhou&s;e, we took a Hou&s;e at&mdash;, a Village about two Miles out of Town; and happy I thought my&s;elf, all Things con&s;idered, that I was got off clear, upon &s;o good Terms; and had my hand&s;ome Fellow had but one Cap full of Wit, I had been &s;till well enough.</P>
<P>I propo&s;ed to him either to buy &s;ome Place with the Money, or with Part of it, and offer'd to join my Part to it, which was then in Being, and might have been &s;ecured; &s;o we might have lived tollerably, at lea&s;t, during his Life. But as it is the Part of a Fool to be void of Coun&s;el, &s;o he neglected it, lived on as he did before, kept his Hor&s;es and Men, rid every Day out to the Fore&s;t a Hunting, and nothing was done all this while; but the Money decrea&s;ed apace, and I thought I &s;aw my Ruin ha&s;tening on, without any po&s;&s;ible Way to prevent it.</P>
<P>I was not wanting with all that Per&s;wa&s;ions and Entreaties could perform, but it was all fruitle&s;s; re|pre&s;enting to him how fa&s;t our Money wa&s;ted, and
<PB N="16" REF="14">
what would be our Condition when it was gone, made no Impre&s;&s;ion on him; but like one &s;tupid, he went on, not valuing all that Tears and Lamentations could be &s;uppos'd to do; nor did he abate his Figure or E|quipage, his Hor&s;es or Servants, even to the la&s;t; till he had not a hundred Pounds left in the whole World.</P>
<P>It was not above three Years that all the Ready-Money was thus &s;pending off; yet he &s;pent it as I may &s;ay, fooli&s;hly too, for he kept no valuable Com|pany neither; but generally with Hunt&s;men and Hor&s;e-Cour&s;ers, and Men meaner than him&s;elf, which is another Con&s;equence of a Man's being a Fool; &s;uch can never take Delight in Men more wi&s;e and capable than them&s;elves; and that makes them conver&s;e with Scoundrels, drink Belch with Porters, and keep Com|pany always below them&s;elves.</P>
<P>This was my wretched Condition, when one Morn|ing my Husband told me, he was &s;en&s;ible he was come to a mi&s;erable Condition, and he would go and &s;eek his Fortune &s;omewhere or other; he had &s;aid &s;ome|thing to that Purpo&s;e &s;everal Times before that, upon my pre&s;&s;ing him to con&s;ider his Circum&s;tances, and the Circum&s;tances of his Family, before it &s;hould be too late: But as I found he had no Meaning in any Thing of that Kind, as indeed, he had not much in any Thing he ever &s;aid; &s;o I thought they were but Words of Cour&s;e now: When he &s;aid he wou'd be gone, I us'd to wi&s;h &s;ecretly, and even &s;ay in my Thoughts, <HI>I wi&s;h you wou'd, for if you go on thus, you will &s;tarve us all.</HI></P>
<P>He &s;taid, however, at Home all that Day, and lay at home that Night; early the next Morning he gets out of Bed, goes to a Window which look'd out to|wards the Stables, and &s;ounds his <HI>French</HI> Horn, as he call'd it; which was his u&s;ual Signal to call his Men to go out a hunting.</P>
<P>It was about the latter-End of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> and &s;o was light yet at five a-Clock, and it was about that Time that I heard him and his two Men go out and &s;hut the
<PB N="17" REF="15">
Yard-Gates after them. He &s;aid nothing to me more than as u&s;ual when he us'd to go out upon his Sport; neither did I ri&s;e, or &s;ay any Thing to him that was material, but went to-&s;leep again after he was gone, for two Hours, or thereabouts.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be a little &s;urprizing to the Reader to tell him at once, that after this, I never &s;aw my Husband more; but to go farther, I not only never &s;aw him more, but I never heard from him, or of him, neither of any or either of his two Servants, or of the Hor&s;es, either what became of them, where, or which Way they went, or what they did, or intended to do, no more than if the Ground had open'd and &s;wallow'd them all up, and no-body had known it; except as hereafter.</P>
<P>I was not, for the fir&s;t Night or two, at all &s;ur|priz'd, no nor very much the fir&s;t Week or two, be|lieving that if any Thing Evil had befallen them, I &s;hould &s;oon enough have heard of that; and al&s;o know|ing that he had two Servants and three Hor&s;es with him, it would be the &s;trange&s;t Thing in the World that any Thing could befal them all, but that I mu&s;t &s;ome Time or other hear of them.</P>
<P>But you will ea&s;ily allow, that as Time run on a Week, two Weeks, a Month, two Months, and &s;o on I was dreadfully frighted at la&s;t, and the more when I look'd into my own Circum&s;tances, and con&s;ider'd the Condition in which I was left; with five Children, and not one farthing Sub&s;i&s;tance for them, other than about &s;eventy Pounds in Money, and what few Things of Value I had about me, which, tho' con&s;iderable in them&s;elves, were yet nothing to feed a Family, and for a Length of Time too.</P>
<P>What to do I knew not, nor to whom to have Re|cour&s;e; to keep in the Hou&s;e where I was, I could not, the Rent being too great; and to leave it without his Order, if my Husband &s;hould return, I could not think of that neither; &s;o that I continued extremely perplex'd, melancholly, and di&s;courag'd, to the la&s;t Degree.</P>

I remain'd in this dejected Condition near a Twelve-month. My Husband had two Si&s;ters, who were married, and liv'd very well, and &s;ome other near Re|lations that I knew of, and I hop'd would do &s;ome|thing for me; and I frequently &s;ent to the&s;e, to know if they could give me any Account of my vagrant Creature; but they all declar'd to me in an&s;wer, that they knew nothing about him; and after frequent &s;end|ing, began to think me trouble&s;ome, and to let me know they thought &s;o too, by their treating my Maid with very &s;light and unhand&s;ome Returns to her En|quiries.</P>
<P>This grated hard, and added to my Affliction, but I had no Recour&s;e but to my Tears, for I had not a Friend of my own left me in the World: I &s;hould have ob&s;erv'd, that it was about half a Year before this Elope|ment of my Husband, that the Di&s;a&s;ter I mention'd above befel my Brother; who broke, and that in &s;uch bad Circum&s;tances, that I had the Mortification to hear not only that he was in Pri&s;on, but that there would be little or nothing to be had by Way of Compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Misfortunes &s;eldom come alone: This was the Fore-runner of my Husband's Flight; and as my Expec|tations were cut off on that Side, my Husband gone, and my Family of Children on my Hands, and no|thing to &s;ub&s;i&s;t them, my Condition was the mo&s;t deplorable that Words can expre&s;s.</P>
<P>I had &s;ome Plate and &s;ome Jewels, as might be &s;uppo&s;ed, my Fortune and former Circum&s;tances con|&s;ider'd; and my Husband, who had never &s;taid to be di&s;tre&s;s'd, had not been put to the Nece&s;&s;ity of rifling me, as Husbands u&s;ually do in &s;uch Ca&s;es: But as I had &s;een an End of all the Ready Money, during the long Time I had liv'd in a State of Expectation for my Husband, &s;o I began to make away one Thing after another, till tho&s;e few Things of Value which I had, began to le&s;&s;en apace, and I &s;aw nothing but Mi&s;ery and the utmo&s;t Di&s;tre&s;s before me, even to have my Children &s;tarve before my Face. I leave any one that is a Mother of Children, and has liv'd in

Plenty and good Fa&s;hion, to con&s;ider and reflect, what mu&s;t be my Condition; As to my Husband, I had now no Hope or Expectation of &s;eeing him any more; and, indeed, if I had, he was the Man, of all the Men in the World, the lea&s;t able to help me, or to have turn'd his Hand to the gaining one Shilling to|wards le&s;&s;ening our Di&s;tre&s;s; he neither had the Ca|pacity or the Inclination; he could have been no Clerk, for he &s;carce wrote a legible Hand; he was &s;o far from being able to write Sen&s;e, that he could not make Sen&s;e of what others wrote; he was &s;o far from under&s;tanding good <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that he could not &s;pell good <HI>Engli&s;h:</HI> To be out of all Bu&s;ine&s;s was his Delight; and he would &s;tand leaning again&s;t a Po&s;t for half an Hour together, with a Pipe in his Mouth, with all the Tranquillity in the World, &s;moaking, <HI>like</HI> Dryden's <HI>Countryman that whi&s;tled as he went for Want of Thought,</HI> and this even when his Family was, as it were &s;tarving, that little he had wa&s;ting, and that we were all bleeding to Death; he not knowing, and as little con&s;idering, where to get another Shilling when the la&s;t was &s;pent.</P>
<P>This being his Temper, and the Extent of his Ca|pacity, I confe&s;s I did not &s;ee &s;o much Lo&s;s in his parting with me, as at fir&s;t I thought I did; tho' it was hard and cruel, to the la&s;t Degree in him, not giving me the lea&s;t Notice of his De&s;ign; and, indeed, that which I was mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;h'd at, wa, that &s;eeing he mu&s;t certainly have intended this Excur&s;ion &s;ome few Moments at lea&s;t, before he put it in Practice, yet he did not come and take what little Stock of Mo|ney we had left; or at lea&s;t, a Share of it, to bear his Expence for a little while, but he did not; and I am morally certain he had not five Guineas with him in the World, when he went away: All that I cou'd come to the Knowledge of, about him was, that he left his Hunting-Horn, which he call'd the <HI>French</HI> Horn, in the Stable, and his Hunting Saddle, went away in a hand&s;ome Furniture, as they call it, which he u&s;ed &s;ometimes to travel with; having an

embroidered Hou&s;ing a Ca&s;e of Pi&s;tols, and other Things belonging to them; and one of his Servants had another Saddle with Pi&s;tols, though plain; and the other a long Gun; &s;o that they did not go out as Sport&s;men, but rather as Travellers: What Part of the World they went to, I never heard for many Years.</P>
<P>As I have &s;aid, I &s;ent to his Relations, but they &s;ent me &s;hort and &s;urly An&s;wers; nor did any one of them offer to come to &s;ee me, or to &s;ee the Children, or &s;o much as to enquire after them, well perceiving that I was in a Condition that was likely to be &s;oon trouble&s;ome to them: But it was no Time now to dally with them, or with the World; I left off &s;ending to them, and went my&s;elf among them; laid my Cir|cum&s;tances open to them, told them my whole Ca&s;e, and the Condition I was reduc'd to, begg'd they would advi&s;e me what Cour&s;e to take, laid my&s;elf as low as they could de&s;ire, and intreated them to con&s;ider that I was not in a Condition to help my&s;elf, and that without &s;ome A&s;&s;i&s;tance, we mu&s;t all inevitably peri&s;h: I told them, that if I had had but one Child or two Children, I would have done my Endeavour to have work'd for them with my Needle, and &s;hould only have come to them to beg them to help me to &s;ome Work, that I might get our Bread by my Labour; but to think of one &s;ingle Woman not bred to work, and at a Lo&s;s where to get Employment, to get the Bread of five Children, that was not po&s;&s;ible, &s;ome of my Children being young too, and none of them big enough to help one another.</P>
<P>It was all one, I receiv'd not one Farthing of A&s;|&s;i&s;tance from any Body, was hardly ask'd to &s;it down at the two Si&s;ters Hou&s;es, nor offer'd to eat or drink at two more near Relations. The Fifth, an ancient Gentlewoman, Aunt-in-Law to my Husband, a Widow, and the lea&s;t able al&s;o of any of the re&s;t, did, indeed, ask me to &s;it down, gave me a Dinner, and refre&s;h'd me with a kinder Treatment than any of the re&s;t; but added the melancholly Part, <HI>viz.</HI> That &s;he would have
<PB N="21" REF="19">
help'd me, but that, indeed, &s;he was not able; which, however, I was &s;atisfied was very true.</P>
<P>Here I reliev'd my&s;elf with the con&s;tant A&s;&s;i&s;tant of the Afflicted, I mean Tears; for, relating to her how I was received by the other of my Husband's Relations, it made me built into Tears, and I cry'd vehemently for a great while together, till I made the good old Gentlewoman cry too &s;everal Times.</P>
<P>However, I came home from them all without any Relief, and went on at Home till I was reduc'd to &s;uch inexpre&s;&s;ible Di&s;tre&s;s, that it is not to be de&s;scrib'd: I had been &s;everal Times after this at the old Aunt's; for I prevail'd with her to promi&s;e me to go and talk with the other Relations; at lea&s;t, that, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;he could bring &s;ome of them to take off the Children, or to contribute &s;omething towards their Maintenance; and, to do her Ju&s;tice, &s;he did u&s;e her Endeavour with them, but all was to no Purpo&s;e, they would do no|thing, at lea&s;t that Way: I think, with much Entreaty, $he obtain'd by a kind of Collection among them all, about eleven or twelve Shillings in Money; which, $ho' it was a Pre&s;ent Comfort, was yet not to be nam'd as capable to deliver me from any Part of the Load that lay upon me.</P>
<P>There was a poor Woman that had been a kind of a Dependant upon our Family, and who I had often, a|mong the re&s;t of the Relations, been very kind to; my Maid put it into my Head one Morning to &s;end to his poor Woman and to &s;ee whether &s;he might not be $ble to help, in this dreadful Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t remember it here, to the Prai&s;e of this poor Girl my Maid, that tho' I was not able to give her any Wages, and had told her &s;o, nay I was not able $o pay her the Wages that I was in Arrears to her, yet he would not leave me; nay, and as long as &s;he had any Money, when I had none, &s;he would help me $ut of her own; for which, tho' I acknowledg'd her Kindne&s;s and Fidelity, yet it was but a bad Coin that he was paid in at la&s;t, as will appear in its Place.</P>
<P><HI>AMY,</HI> (for that was her Name) put it into my Thoughts to &s;end for this poor Woman to come to me,
<PB N="22" REF="20">
for I was now in great Di&s;tre&s;s, and I re&s;olv'd to do &s;o; but ju&s;t the very Morning that I intended it, the old Aunt, with the poor Woman in her Company, came to &s;ee me; the good old Gentlewoman was, it &s;eems, heartily concern'd for me, and had been talking again among tho&s;e People, to &s;ee what &s;he could do for me; but to very little Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>You &s;hall judge a little of my pre&s;ent Di&s;tre&s;s by the Po&s;ture &s;he found me in: I had five little Children, the elde&s;t was under ten Years old, and I had not one Shilling in the Hou&s;e to buy them Victuals, but had &s;ent <HI>Amy</HI> out with a Silver Spoon, to &s;ell it, and bring home &s;omething from the Butcher's; and I was in a Parlour, &s;itting on the Ground, with a great Heap of old Rags, Linnen, and other Things about me, look|ing them over, to &s;ee if I had any Thing among them that would Sell or Pawn for a little Money, and had been crying ready to bur&s;t my&s;elf, to think what I &s;hould do next.</P>
<P>At this Juncture they knock'd at the Door, I thought it had been <HI>Amy,</HI> &s;o I did not ri&s;e up, but one of the Children open'd the Door, and they came directly into the Room where I was, and where they found me in that Po&s;ture, and crying vehemently, as above; I was &s;urpriz'd at their coming, you may be &s;ure, e&s;pe|cially &s;eeing the Per&s;on I had but ju&s;t before re&s;olv'd to &s;end for: But when they &s;aw me; how I look'd, for my Eyes were &s;well'd with crying, and what a Condition I was in as to the Hou&s;e, and the Heaps of Things that were about me, and e&s;pecially when I told them what I was doing, and on what Occa&s;ion, they &s;at down like <HI>Job</HI>'s three Comforters, and &s;aid not one Word to me for a great while, but both of them cry'd as fa&s;t, and as heartily as I did.</P>
<P>The Truth was, there was no need of much Di&s;|cour&s;e in the Ca&s;e, the Thing &s;poke it&s;elf; they &s;aw me in Rags and Dirt; who was but a little before riding in my Coach; thin, and looking almo&s;t like one &s;tarv'd, who was before fat and beautiful: The Hou&s;e that was before hand&s;omely furni&s;h'd with Pictures and Ornaments, Cabinets, Peir-Gla&s;&s;es, and every thing &s;uitable, was
<PB N="23" REF="21">
now &s;tripp'd, and naked, mo&s;t of the Goods having been &s;eiz'd by the Landlord for Rent, or &s;old to buy Nece&s;&s;aries; in a Word, all was Mi&s;ery and Di&s;tre&s;s, the Face of Ruin was every where to be &s;een; we had eaten up almo&s;t every Thing, and little remain'd, unle&s;s, like one of the pitiful Women of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> I &s;hould eat up my very Children them&s;elves.</P>
<P>After the&s;e two good Creatures had &s;at, as I &s;ay, in Silence &s;ome Time, and had then look'd about them, my Maid <HI>Amy</HI> came in, and brought with her a &s;mall Brea&s;t of Mutton, and two great Bunches of Turnips, which &s;he intended to &s;tew for our Dinner; As for me, my Heart was &s;o overwhelm'd at &s;eeing the&s;e two Friends, for &s;uch they were, tho' poor, and at their &s;eeing me in &s;uch a Condition, that I fell into another violent Fit of Crying; &s;o that in &s;hort, I could not &s;peak to them again for a great while longer.</P>
<P>During my being in &s;uch an Agony, they went to my Maid <HI>Amy</HI> at another Part of the &s;ame Room, and talk'd with her: <HI>Amy</HI> told them all my Circum&s;tances, and &s;et them forth in &s;uch moving Terms, and &s;o to the Life, that I could not upon any Terms have done it like her my&s;elf, and in a Word, affected them both with it in &s;uch a Manner, that the old Aunt came to me, and tho' hardly able to &s;peak for Tears: Look ye, Cou&s;in, &s;aid &s;he, in a few Words, Things mu&s;t not &s;tand thus; &s;ome Cour&s;e mu&s;t be taken, and that forth|with; pray where were the&s;e Children born? I told her the Pari&s;h where we liv'd before, that four of them were born there; and one in the Hou&s;e where I now was, where the Landlord, after having &s;eiz'd my Goods for the Rent pa&s;t, not then knowing my Circum&s;tan|ces, had now given me leave to live for a whole Year more without any Rent, being moved with Compa&s;&s;ion; but that this Year was now almo&s;t expir'd.</P>
<P>Upon hearing this Account, they came to this Re|&s;olution: That the Children &s;hould be all carried by them to the Door of one of the Relations mention'd above, and be &s;et down there by the Maid <HI>Amy,</HI> and that I, the Mother, &s;hould remove for &s;ome Days, &s;hut up the Doors, and be gone; that the People &s;hould be
<PB N="24" REF="22">
told, That if they did not think &s;it to take &s;ome Care of the Children, they might &s;end for the Church-War|dens if they thought that better; for that they were born in that Pari&s;h, and there they mu&s;t be provided for; as for the other Child which was born in the Pari&s;h of&mdash;, that was already taken care of by the Pari&s;h-Officers there; for, indeed, they were &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the Di&s;tre&s;s of the Family, that they had at fir&s;t Word, done what was their Part to do.</P>
<P>This was what the&s;e good Women propos'd, and bade me leave the re&s;t to them. I was at fir&s;t, &s;adly afflicted at the Thoughts of parting with my Children, and e&s;pecially at that terrible Thing, their being taken into the Pari&s;h-keeping; and then a hundred terrible Things came into my Thoughts; <HI>viz.</HI> of Pari&s;h-Chil|dren being &s;tarv'd at Nur&s;e: of their being ruin'd, let grow crooked, lam'd, and the like, for want of being taken care of; and this &s;unk my very Heart within me.</P>
<P>But the Mi&s;ery of my own Circum&s;tances hardened my Heart again&s;t my own Fle&s;h and Blood; and when I con&s;ider'd they mu&s;t inevitably be &s;tarv'd, and I too, if I continued to keep them about me, I began to be reconcil'd to parting with them all, any how, and any where, that I might be freed from the dreadful Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of &s;eeing them all peri&s;h, and peri&s;hing with them my&s;elf: So I agreed to go away out of the Hou&s;e, and leave the Management of the whole Matter to my Maid <HI>Amy,</HI> and to them, and accordingly I did &s;o; and the &s;ame Afternoon they carred them all away to one of their <HI>Aunts.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Amy,</HI> a re&s;olute Girl, knock'd at the Door, with the Children all with her, and bade the Elde&s;t, as &s;oon as the Door was open run in, and the re&s;t after her: She &s;et them all down at the Door before &s;he knock'd, and when &s;he knock'd, &s;he &s;taid till a Maid Servant came to the Door; Sweetheart, &s;aid &s;he, pray go in and tell your Mi&s;tre&s;s, here are her little Cou&s;ins come to &s;ee her from&mdash;, naming the Town where we liv'd, at which the Maid offer'd to go back: Here Child, &s;ays <HI>Amy,</HI> take one of them in your Hand, and

I'll bring the re&s;t; &s;o &s;he gives her the lea&s;t, and the Wench goes in mighty innocently, with the little one in her Hand, upon which <HI>Amy</HI> turns the re&s;t in after her, &s;huts the Door &s;oftly, and marches off as fa&s;t as &s;he cou'd.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t in the Interval of this, and even while the Maid and her Mi&s;tre&s;s' were quarrelling, for the Mi&s;tre&s;s rav'd and &s;colded at her like a Mad-woman, and had order'd her to go and &s;top the Maid <HI>Amy,</HI> and turn all the Chil|dren out of the Doors again; but &s;he had been at the Door, and <HI>Amy</HI> was gone, and the Wench was out of her Wits, and the Mi&s;tre&s;s too: I &s;ay, ju&s;t at this Juncture came the poor old Woman, not the Aunt, but the other of the two that had been with me, and knocks at the Door; the Aunt did not go, becau&s;e &s;he had pretended to advocate for me, and they would have &s;u&s;pected her of &s;ome Contrivance; but as for the other Woman, they did not &s;o much as know that &s;he had kept up any Corre&s;pondence with me.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> and &s;he had concerted this between them, and it was well enough contriv'd that they did &s;o. When &s;he came into the Hou&s;e, the Mi&s;tre&s;s was &s;uming and rag|ing like one di&s;tracted, and calling the Maid all the fooli&s;h Jades and Sluts that &s;he could think of, and that &s;he would take the Children and turn them all out into the Streets. The good poor Woman &s;eeing her in &s;uch a Pa&s;&s;ion, turn'd about as if &s;he would be gone a|gain, and &s;aid, Madam, I'll come again another Time, I &s;ee you are engag'd. No, no, Mrs&mdash;, &s;ays the Mi&s;tre&s;s, I am not much engag'd, &s;it down: This &s;en&s;e|le&s;s Creature here has brought in my Fool of a Bro|ther's whole Hou&s;e of Children upon me, and tells me, that a Wench brought them to the Door, and thru$ them in, and bade her carry them to me; but it &s;hall be no Di&s;turbance to me, for I have order'd them to be &s;et in the Street, without the Door, and &s;o let the Church-Wardens take care of them, or el&s;e make this dull Jade carry 'em back to&mdash;again, and let her that brought them into the World, look after them if &s;he will; what does &s;he &s;end her Brats to me for?</P>

The la&s;t, indeed, had been the be&s;t of the two, &s;ays the poor Woman, if it had been to be done, and that brings me to tell you my Errand, and the Occa&s;ion of my coming, for I came on purpo&s;e about this very Bu|&s;ine&s;s, and to have prevented this being put upon you, if I cou'd; but I &s;ee I am come too late.</P>

<P>I knock'd at the Door, but no-body came, till at la&s;t &s;ome of the Neighbours Servants call'd to me, and &s;aid, There's no-body lives there, Mi&s;tre&s;s, what do you knock for?

<P>Out of Doors! <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> what with all her Children, poor Lambs, what is become of them? Why truly, nothing wor&s;e, <HI>&s;aid they,</HI> can come to them than &s;tay|ing here, for they were almo&s;t &s;tarv'd with Hunger; &s;o the Neighbours &s;eeing the poor Lady in &s;uch Di&s;tre&s;s, for &s;he &s;tood crying, and wringing her Hands over her Children like one di&s;tracted, &s;ent for the Church-War|dens to take care of the Children; and they, when they came, took the younge&s;t, which was born in this Pari&s;h, and have got it a very good Nur&s;e, and tak|en Care of it; but as for the other four, they had &s;ent them away to &s;ome of their Father's Relations, who were very &s;ub&s;tantial People, and who be&s;ides that, liv'd in the Pari&s;h where they were born.</P>

<P>This was all acted to the Life by this good, kind, poor Creature; for tho' her De&s;ign was perfectly good and charitable, yet there was not one Word of it true in Fact: For I was not turn'd out of Doors by the Landlord, nor gone di&s;tracted; it was true, indeed, that at parting with my poor Children, I fainted, and was like one Mad when I came to my&s;elf and found they were gone; but I remain'd in the Hou&s;e a good while after that; as you &s;hall hear.</P>

<P>Prithee what need they cry at our Door? <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> 'tis the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Pari&s;h to provide for them, they &s;han't cry at our Door; if they do, I'll give them nothing: Wont you, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> but I will; remember that dreadful Scripture is directly again&s;t us, <HI>Prov.</HI> xxi. 13. <HI>Who&s;e &s;toppeth his Ears at the Cry of the Poor, he al&s;o &s;hall cry him&s;elf, but &s;hall not be heard.</HI></P>

Well, well, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> you mu&s;t do what you will, be|cau&s;e you pretend to be Ma&s;ter; but if I had my Will, I would &s;end them where they ought to to be &s;en, I would &s;end them from whence they came.</P>
<P>Then the poor Woman put in, and &s;aid, But, Ma|dam, that is &s;ending them to &s;tarve indeed; for the Pari&s;h has no Obligation to take Care of them, and &s;o they would lie and peri&s;h in the Street.</P>
<P>Or be &s;ent back again, &s;ays the Husband, to our Pari&s;h in a Cripple-cart, by the Ju&s;tice's Warrant, and &s;o expo&s;e us and all the Relations to the la&s;t Degree, among our Neighbours, and among tho&s;e who knew the good old Gentleman their Grandfather, who liv'd and flouri&s;hed in this Pari&s;h &s;o many Years, and was &s;o well belov'd among all People, and de&s;erved it &s;o well.</P>
<P>I don't value that one Farthing, not I, &s;ays the Wife, I'll keep none of them.</P>
<P>Well, my Dear, &s;ays her Husband, but I value it, for I won't have &s;uch a Blot lie upon the Family, and upon your Children; he was a worthy, ancient, and good Man, and his Name is re&s;pected among all his Neighbours; it will be a Reproach to you, that are his Daughter, and to our Children, that are his Grand-Children, that we &s;hould let your Brother's Children peri&s;h, or come to be a Charge to the Publick, in the very Place where your Family once flouri&s;hed: Come, &s;ay no more, I will &s;ee what can be done.</P>
<P>Upon this, he &s;ends and gathers all the Relations to|gether at a Tavern hard by, and &s;ent for the four little Children that they might &s;ee them; and they all, at fir&s;t Word, agreed to have them taken Care of; and becau&s;e his Wife was &s;o furious that &s;he would not &s;uf|fer one of them to be kept at Home, they agreed to keep them all together for a while; &s;o they committed them to the poor Woman that had managed the Affair for them, and enter'd into Obligations to one another to &s;upply the needful Sums for their Maintenance; and not to have one &s;eparated from the re&s;t, they &s;ent for the younge&s;t from the Pari&s;h where it was taken in, and had them all brought up together.</P>

I would take up too long a Part of this Story to give a particular Account with what a charitable Tenderne&s;s this good Per&s;on, who was but an Uncle in law to them, managed that Affair; how careful he was of them; went con&s;tantly to &s;ee them, and to &s;ee that they were well provided for, cloathed, put to School, and at la&s;t put out in the World for their Advantage; but 'tis enough to &s;ay he acted more like a Father to them, than an Uncle-in-law, though all along much again&s;t his Wives Con&s;ent, who was of a Di&s;po&s;ition not &s;o tender and compa&s;&s;ionate as her Husband</P>
<P>You may believe I heard this with the &s;ame Plea&s;ure which I now feel at the relating it again; for I was terribly frighted at the Apprehen&s;ions of my Children being brought to Mi&s;ery and Di&s;tre&s;s, as tho&s;e mu&s;t be who have no Friends, but are left to Pari&s;h Benevolence.</P>
<P>I was now, however, entring on a new Scene of Life; I had a great Hou&s;e upon my Hands, and &s;ome Furniture left in it, but I was no more able to main|tain my&s;elf and my Maid <HI>Amy</HI> in it, than I was my five Children; nor had I any Thing to &s;ub&s;i&s;t with, but what I might get by working, and that was not a Town where much Work was to be had.</P>
<P>My Landlord had been very kind indeed, after he came to know my Circum&s;tances, though before I was acquainted with that Part, he had gone &s;o far as to &s;eize my Goods, and to carry &s;ome of them off too.</P>
<P>But I had liv'd three Quarters of a Year in his Hou&s;e after that, and had paid him no Rent, and which was wor&s;e, I was in no Condition to pay him any; how|ever, I ob&s;erved he came oftner to &s;ee me, look'd kind|er upon me, and &s;poke more friendly to me, than he us'd to do; particularly the la&s;t two or three Times he had been there, he ob&s;erved, he &s;aid, how poorly I lived, how low I was reduced, and the like; told me it grieved him for my &s;ake; and the la&s;t Time of all he was kinder &s;till, told me he came to dine with me, and that I &s;hould give him leave to treat me; &s;o he called my Maid <HI>Amy,</HI> and &s;ent her out to buy a Joint of Meat; he told her what &s;he &s;hould buy; but naming two or three Things, either of which &s;he might take,
<PB N="31" REF="29">
the Maid, a cunning Wench, and faithful to me, as the Skin to my Back, did not buy any Thing out right, but brought the Butcher along with her, with both the Things that &s;he had cho&s;en, for him to plea&s;e him&s;elf; the one was a large very good Leg of Veal; the other a Piece of the Fore-ribs of Roa&s;ting beef; he look'd at them, but bade me cha$fer with the Butcher for him, and I did &s;o, and came back to him, and told him what the Butcher demanded for either of them, and what each of them came to; &s;o he pulls out 11 <HI>s.</HI> and 3 <HI>d.</HI> which they came to together, and bade me take them both; the re&s;t, he &s;aid, would &s;erve another Time.</P>
<P>I was &s;urpriz'd, you may be &s;ure, at the Bounty of a Man that had but a little while ago been my Terror, and had torn the Goods out of my Hou&s;e, like a Fury; but I con&s;idered that my Di&s;tre&s;&s;es had mollified his Temper, and that he had afterwards been &s;o compa&s;|&s;ionate as to give me Leave to live Rent-free in the Hou&s;e a whole Year.</P>
<P>But now he put on the Face, not of a Man of Com|pa&s;&s;ion only, but of a Man of Friend&s;hip and Kindne&s;s, and this was &s;o unexpected, that it was &s;urprizing: We chatted together, and were, as I may call it, chearful, which was more than I could &s;ay I had been for three Years before; he &s;ent for Wine and Beer too, for I had none; poor <HI>Amy</HI> and I had drank nothing but Water for many Weeks, and indeed, I have often wonder'd at the faithful Temper of the poor Girl; for which I but ill requited her at la&s;t.</P>
<P>When <HI>Amy</HI> was come with the Wine, he made her fill a Gla&s;s to him, and with the Gla&s;s in his Hand, he came to me and ki&s;s'd me, which I was, I confe&s;s, a little &s;urpriz'd at, but more at what followed; for he told me, That as the &s;ad Condition which I was redu|ced to, had made him pity me, &s;o my Conduct in it, and the Courage I bore it with, had given him a more than ordinary Re&s;pect for me, and made him very thoughtful for my good; that he was re&s;olved for the pre&s;ent to do &s;omething to relieve me, and to employ
<PB N="32" REF="30">
his Thoughts in the mean Time, to &s;ee if he could, for the future, put me into a Way to &s;upport my&s;elf.</P>
<P>While he found me change Colour, and look &s;ur|priz'd at his Di&s;cour&s;e, for &s;o I did to be &s;ure, he turns to my Maid <HI>Amy,</HI> and looking at her, he &s;ays to me, I &s;ay all this, Madam, before your Maid, becau&s;e both &s;he and you &s;hall know that I have no ill De&s;ign, and that I have, in meer Kindne&s;s, re&s;olved to do &s;ome|thing for you, if I can; and as I have been a Witne&s;s of the uncommon Hone&s;ty and Fidelity of Mrs. <HI>Amy</HI> here, to you in all your Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, I know &s;he may be tru&s;ted with &s;o hone&s;t a De&s;ign as mine is; for I a&s;&s;ure you, I bear a proportion'd Regard to your Maid too, for her Affection to you.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> made him a Curt'&s;y, and the poor Girl look'd &s;o confounded with Joy, that &s;he could not &s;peak, but her Colour came and went, and every now and then &s;he blu&s;h'd as red as Scarlet, and the next Minute look'd as pale as Death: Well, having &s;aid this, he &s;ate down, made me &s;it down, and then drank to me, and made me drink two Gla&s;&s;es of Wine together; for, &s;ays he, you have Need of it, and &s;o indeed I had: When he had done &s;o, Come <HI>Amy,</HI> &s;ays he, with your Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es's Leave, you &s;hall have a Gla&s;s too, &s;o he made her drink two Gla&s;&s;es al&s;o; and then ri&s;ing up, And now, <HI>Amy,</HI> &s;ays he, go and get Dinner; and you, Madam, &s;ays he to me, go up and dre&s;s you, and come down and &s;mile and be merry; adding, I'll make you ea&s;y, if I can; and in the mean Time, he &s;aid, he would walk in the Garden.</P>
<P>When he was gone, <HI>Amy</HI> changed her Countenance indeed, and looked as merry as ever &s;he did in her Life; Dear Madam, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> what does this Gentleman mean? Nay, <HI>Amy, &s;aid I,</HI> he means to do us Good, you &s;ee, don't he? I know no other Meaning he can have, for he can get nothing by me: I warrant you, Madam, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> he'll ask you a Favour by and by: No, no, you are mi&s;taken, <HI>Amy,</HI> I dare &s;ay, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> you heard what he &s;aid, didn't you?

what he will do after Dinner: Well, well, <HI>Amy, &s;ays I,</HI> you have hard Thoughts of him, I cannot be of your Opinion; I don't &s;ee any Thing in him yet that looks like it: As to that, Madam, <HI>&s;ays</HI> Amy, I don't &s;ee any Thing of it yet neither; but what &s;hould move a Gen|tleman to take Pity of us, as he does? Nay, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> that's a hard Thing too, that we &s;hould judge a Man to be wicked becau&s;e he's charitable; and vicious becau&s;e he's kind; O Madam, <HI>&s;ays</HI> Amy, there's abundance of Charity begins in that Vice, and he is not &s;o unac|quainted with Things, as not to know, that Poverty is the &s;tronge&s;t Incentive; a Temptation, again&s;t which no Virtue is powerful enough to &s;tand out; he knows your Condition as well as you do: Well, and what then? Why then he knows too that you are young and hand|&s;ome, and he has the &s;ure&s;t Bait in the World to take you with.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>Amy, &s;aid I,</HI> but he may find him&s;elf mi&s;tak|en too in &s;uch a Thing as that: Why, Madam, <HI>&s;ays</HI> Amy, I hope you won't deny him, if he &s;hould of|fer it.</P>
<P>What d'ye mean by that, <HI>Hu&s;&s;y, &s;aid I?</HI> No, I'd &s;tarve fir&s;t.</P>
<P>I hope not, Madam, I hope you would be wi&s;er; I'm &s;ure if he will &s;et you up, as he talks of, you ought to deny him nothing; and you will &s;tarve if you do not con&s;ent, that's certain.</P>
<P>What, con&s;ent to lye with him for Bread? <HI>Amy, &s;aid. I,</HI> how can you talk &s;o?</P>
<P>Nay, Madam, <HI>&s;ays</HI> Amy, I don't think you wou'd for any Thing el&s;e; it would not be lawful for any thing el&s;e, but for Bread, Madam; why no body can &s;tarve, there's no bearing that, I'm &s;ure.</P>
<P>Ay, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> but if he would give me an E&s;tate to live on, he &s;hould not lye with me, I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
<P>Why look you, Madam, if he would but give you enough to live ea&s;y upon, he &s;hould lye with me for it with all my Heart.</P>
<P>That's a Token, <HI>Amy,</HI> of inimitable Kindne&s;s to me, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> and I know how to value it; but there's more Friend&s;hip than Hone&s;ty in it, <HI>Amy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="32">
O Madam, <HI>&s;ays</HI> Amy, I'd do any Thing to get you out of this &s;ad Condition; as to Hone&s;ty, I think Ho|ne&s;ty is out of the Que&s;tion, when &s;tarving is the Ca&s;e; are not we almo&s;t &s;tarved to Death?</P>
<P>I am indeed, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> and thou art for my Sake; but to be a Whore, <HI>Amy!&mdash;</HI>and there I &s;topt.</P>
<P>Dear Madam, <HI>&s;ays</HI> Amy, if I will &s;tarve for your Sake, I will be a Whore, or any Thing, for your Sake; why, I would die for you, if I were put to it.</P>
<P>Why that's an Exce&s;s of Affection, <HI>Amy,</HI> &s;aid I, I never met with before; I wi&s;h I may be ever in a Con|dition to make you &s;ome Returns &s;uitable: But how|ever, <HI>Amy,</HI> you &s;hall not be a Whore to him, to oblige him to be kind to me; no, <HI>Amy,</HI> nor I won't be a Whore to him, if he would give me much more than he is able to give me, or do for me.</P>
<P>Why, Madam, <HI>&s;ays</HI> Amy, I don't &s;ay I will go and ask him; but, I &s;ay, if he &s;hould promi&s;e to do &s;o and &s;o for you, and the Condition was &s;uch, that he would not &s;erve you unle&s;s I would let him lye with me, he &s;hould lye with me as often as he would, rather than you &s;hould not have his A&s;&s;i&s;tance; but this is but Talk, Ma|dam, I don't &s;ee any need of &s;uch Di&s;cour&s;e, and you are of Opinion that there will be no Need of it.</P>
<P>Indeed &s;o I am, <HI>Amy;</HI> but, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> if there was, I tell you again, I'd die before I would con&s;ent, or before you &s;hould con&s;ent for my Sake.</P>
<P>Hitherto I had not only pre&s;erv'd the Virtue it&s;elf, but the virtuous Inclination and Re&s;olution; and had I kept my&s;elf there, I had been happy, tho' I had pe|ri&s;h'd of meer Hunger; for, without Que&s;tion, a Wo|man ought rather to die than to pro&s;titute her Virtue and Honour, let the Temptation be what it will.</P>
<P>But to return to my Story; he walk'd about the Gar|den, which was, indeed, all in Di&s;order, and over-run with Weeds, becau&s;e I had not been able to hire a Gar|dener to do any Thing to it, no not &s;o much as to dig up Ground enough to &s;ow a few Turnips and Carrots for Family-u&s;e. After he had view'd it, he came in, and &s;ent <HI>Amy</HI> to fetch a poor Man, a Gardener, that us'd to help our Man-&s;ervant, and carry'd him into the Gar|den,
<PB N="35" REF="33">
and ordered him to do &s;everal Things in it, to put it into a little Order; and this took him up near an Hour.</P>
<P>By this Time I had dre&s;s'd me as well as I could, for tho' I had good Linnen left &s;till, yet I had but a poor Head-dre&s;s, and no Knots, but old Fragments; no Neck-lace, no Ear-rings; all tho&s;e Things were gone long ago for meer Bread.</P>
<P>However, I was tight and clean, and in better Plight than he had &s;een me in a great while, and he look'd ex|treamly pleas'd to &s;ee me &s;o; for he &s;aid I look'd &s;o di&s;|con&s;olate and &s;o afflicted before, that it griev'd him to &s;ee me; and he bid me pluck up a good Heart, for he hop'd to be in a Condition to live in the World, and be beholden to nobody.</P>
<P>I told him that was impo&s;&s;ible, for I mu&s;t be behold|en to him for it, for all the Friends I had in the World would not, nor could not do &s;o much for me as that he &s;poke of. Well, Widow, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> &s;o he call'd me, and &s;o indeed I was in the wor&s;e Sen&s;e that de&s;olate Word could be us'd in, if you are beholden to me, you &s;hall be beholden to nobody el&s;e.</P>
<P>By this Time Dinner was ready, and <HI>Amy</HI> came in to lay the Cloth, and indeed it was happy there was none to dine but he and I, for I had but &s;ix Plates left in the Hou&s;e, and but two Di&s;hes; however, he knew how Things were, and bid me make no Scruple about bringing out what I had, he hop'd to &s;ee me in a better Plight; he did not come, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> to be entertained, but to entertain me, and comfort and encourage me: Thus he went on, &s;peaking &s;o chearfully to me, and &s;uch chearful Things, that it was a Cordial to my very Soul to hear him &s;peak.</P>
<P>Well, we went to Dinner, I am &s;ure I had not eat a good Meal hardly in a Twelvemonth, at lea&s;t, not of &s;uch a Joint of Meat as the Loin of Veal was. I eat in|deed very heartily, and &s;o did he, and he made me drink three or four Gla&s;&s;es of Wine, &s;o that, in &s;hort, my Spirits were lifted up to a Degree I had not been us'd to, and I was not only chearful, but merry, and &s;o he pre&s;s'd me to be.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="34">
I told him, I had a great deal of Rea&s;on to be merry, &s;eeing he had been &s;o kind to me, and had given me Hopes of recovering me from the wor&s;t Circum&s;tances that ever Woman of any Sort of Fortune was &s;unk in|to; that he could not but believe that what he had &s;aid to me was like Life from the Dead; that it was like re|covering one &s;ick from the Brink of the Grave; how I &s;hould ever make him a Return any Way &s;uitable, was what I had not yet had Time to think of; I could only &s;ay, that I &s;hould never forget it while I had Life, and &s;hould be always ready to acknowledge it.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, that was all he de&s;ired of me, that his Re|ward would be the Satisfaction of having re&s;cued me from Mi&s;ery; that he found he was obliging one that knew what Gratitude meant; that he would make it his Bu&s;ine&s;s to make me compleatly ea&s;y, fir&s;t or la&s;t, if it lay in his Power; and in the mean Time, he bid me con&s;ider of any Thing that I thought he might do for me, for my Advantage, and in Order to make me per|fectly ea&s;y.</P>
<P>After we had talked thus, he bid me be chearful; Come, &s;ays he, lay a&s;ide the&s;e melancholy Things, and let us be merry: <HI>Amy</HI> waited at the Table, and &s;he &s;mil'd and laugh'd, and was &s;o merry &s;he could hardly contain it, for the Girl lov'd me to an Exce&s;s, hardly to be de&s;cribed; and it was &s;uch an unexpected Thing to hear any one talk to her Mi&s;tre&s;s, that the Wench was be&s;ides her&s;elf almo&s;t, and as &s;oon as Dinner was over, <HI>Amy</HI> went up Stairs, and put on her be&s;t Clothes too, and came down dre&s;s'd like a Gentlewoman.</P>
<P>We &s;at together talking of a thou&s;and Things, of what had been, and what was to be, all the re&s;t of the Day, and in the Evening he took his Leave of me, with a thou&s;and Expre&s;&s;ions of Kindne&s;s and Tender|ne&s;s, and true Affection to me, but offer'd not the lea&s;t of what my Maid <HI>Amy</HI> had &s;ugge&s;ted.</P>
<P>At his going away, he took me in his Arms, prote&s;t|ed an hone&s;t Kindne&s;s to me; &s;aid a thou&s;and kind Things to me, which I cannot now recollect; and after ki&s;&s;ing me twenty Times, or thereabouts, put a Guinea into my Hand; which, he &s;aid, was for my pre&s;ent

<P>When he was gone, Well, <HI>Amy, &s;aid I,</HI> are you con|vinced now that he is an hone&s;t as well as a true Friend, and that there has been nothing, not the lea&s;t Appear|ance of any thing of what you imagin'd in his Behaviour: Yes, &s;ays <HI>Amy,</HI> I am, but I admire at it; he is &s;uch a Friend as the World, &s;ure, has not Abundance of to &s;hew.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> he is &s;uch a Friend as I have long wanted, and as I have as much Need of as any Creature in the World has, or ever had; and, in &s;hort, I was &s;o overcome with the Comfort of it, that I &s;at down and cry'd for Joy a good-while, as I had formerly cry'd for Sorrow. <HI>Amy</HI> and I went to Bed that Night (for <HI>Amy</HI> lay with me) pretty early, but lay chatting almo&s;t all Night about it, and the Girl was &s;o tran&s;ported, that &s;he got up two or three Times in the Night, and danc'd about the Room in her Shift; in &s;hort, the Girl was half di&s;tracted with the Joy of it; a Te&s;timony &s;till of her violent Affection for her Mi&s;tre&s;s, in which no Servant ever went beyond her.</P>
<P>We heard no more of him for two Days, but the third Day he came again; then he told me, with the &s;ame Kindne&s;s, that he had ordered me a Supply of Hou&s;hold-Goods for the furni&s;hing the Hou&s;e; that in particular, he had &s;ent me back all the Goods that he had &s;eized for Rent, which con&s;i&s;ted, indeed, of the be&s;t of my former Furniture; and now, &s;ays he, I'll tell you what I have had in my Head for you, for your pre&s;ent Supply, and that is, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> that the Hou&s;e being well furni&s;hed, you &s;hall let it out to Lodgings for the Sum|mer-Gentry, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> by which you will ea&s;ily get a good comfortable Sub&s;i&s;tance, e&s;pecially &s;eeing you &s;hall pay me no Rent for two Years, nor after neither, unle&s;s you can afford it.</P>
<P>This was the fir&s;t View I had of living comfortably indeed, and it was a very probable Way, I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s; &s;eeing we had very good Conveniencies, &s;ix Rooms on a Floor, and three Stories high: While he was lay|ing down the Scheme of my Management, came a Cart to the Door with a Load of Goods, and an Uphol&s;ter|er's

<P>Nay, <HI>Amy, &s;ays I,</HI> if I cou'd take him fairly, you may be &s;ure I'd take him above all the Men in the World; it turn'd the very Heart within me, when I heard him &s;ay he lov'd me; how could it do otherwi&s;e! when you know what a Condition I was in before, de&s;pis'd, and trampled on by all the World; I cou'd have took him in my Arms, and ki&s;s'd him as freely as he did me, if it had not been for Shame.</P>

<P>In this I was a double Offender, whatever he was; for I was re&s;olved to commit the Crime, knowing and owning it to be a Crime; he, if it was true as he &s;aid, was fully per&s;waded it was lawful, and in that Per&s;wa&s;i|on he took the Mea&s;ures, and u&s;ed all the Circumlocuti|ons which I am going to &s;peak of.</P>

He &s;aid, No, but on the contrary, he would take it as a Mark of the great|e&s;t Kindne&s;s I could &s;how him; then he went on to give Rea&s;ons why there was no Occa&s;ion to u&s;e the ordinary Ceremony of Delay; or to wait a rea&s;onable Time of Court&s;hip, which was only to avoid Scandal; but, as this was private, it had nothing of that Nature in it; that he had been courting me &s;ome Time, by the be&s;t of Court&s;hip, <HI>viz.</HI> doing Acts of Kindene&s;s to me; and that he had given Te&s;timonies of his &s;incere Affection to me, by Deeds, not by flattering Tri&s;les, and the u&s;ual Court&s;hip of Words, which were often found to have very little Meaning; that he took me not as a Mi&s;tre&s;s, but as his Wi&s;e; and prote&s;ted, it was clear to him he might lawfully do it, and that I was perfectly at Liberty; and a&s;&s;ured me by all that it was po&s;&s;ible for an hone&s;t Man to &s;ay, that he would treat me as his Wi&s;e, as long as he lived; in a Word, he conquer'd all the little Re&s;i&s;tance I intended to make; he prote&s;ted he loved me above all the World, and begg'd I would for once believe him; that he had ne|ver deceiv'd me, and never would, but would make it his Study to make my Life comfortable and happy, and to make me forget the Mi&s;ery I had gone through: I

Mu&s;t I depend upon your Promi&s;e? Why then, &s;aid I, upon the Faith of that Promi&s;e, and in the Sen&s;e of that inexpre&s;&s;ible Kindne&s;s you have &s;hown me, you &s;hall be obliged, and I will be wholly yours to the End of my Life: and with that, I took his Hand which held me by the Hand, and gave it a Ki&s;s.</P>
<P>And thus in Gratitude for the Favours I receiv'd from a Man, was all Sen&s;e of Religion, and Duty to God, all Regard to Virtue and Honour, given up at once, and we were to call one another Man and Wife, who in the Sen&s;e of the Laws, both of God and our Country, were no more than two Adulterers, in &s;hort, a Whore and a Rogue; nor, as I have &s;aid above, was my Con&s;cience &s;ilent in it, though, it &s;eems, his was; for I &s;inn'd with open Eyes, and thereby had a double Guilt upon me; as I always &s;aid his Notions were of another kind, and he either was before of the Opini|on, or argued him&s;elf into it now, that we were both free, and might lawfully marry.</P>
<P>But I was quite of another Side, nay, and my Judg|ment was right, but my Circum&s;tances were my Temp|tation; the Terrors behind me look'd blacker than the Terrors before me; and the dreadful Argument of wanting Bread, and being run into the horrible Di&s;tre&s;|&s;es I was in before, ma&s;ter'd all my Re&s;olution, and I gave my&s;elf up as above.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the Evening we &s;pent very agreeably to me; he was perfectly good-humour'd, and was at that Time very merry; then he made <HI>Amy</HI> dance with him, and I told him I would put <HI>Amy</HI> to Bed to him. <HI>Amy</HI> &s;aid, with all her Heart, &s;he never had been a Bride in her Life; in &s;hort, he made the Girl &s;o merry, that had he not been to lye with me the &s;ame Night, I be|lieve he would have played the Fool with <HI>Amy</HI> for half an Hour, and the Girl would no more have refu&s;ed him than I intended to do; yet before, I had always found her a very mode&s;t Wench, as any I ever &s;aw in all my

Life; but, in &s;hort, the Mirth of that Night, and a few more &s;uch afterwards, ruined the Girl's Mode&s;ty for ever, as &s;hall appear by and by, in its Place.</P>
<P>So far does fooling and toying &s;ometimes go, that I know nothing a young Woman has to be more cautious of; &s;o far had this innocent Girl gone in je&s;ting be|tween her and I, and in talking that &s;he would let him lye with her, if he would but be kinder to me, that at la&s;t &s;he let him lye with her in earne&s;t; and &s;o empty was I now of all Principle, that I encouraged the do|ing it almo&s;t before my Face.</P>
<P>I &s;ay but too ju&s;tly, that I was empty of Principle, becau&s;e, as above, I had yielded to him, not as deluded to believe it lawful, but as overcome by his Kindne&s;s, and terrify'd at the Fear of my own Mi&s;ery if he &s;hould leave me; &s;o with my Eyes open, and with my Con|&s;cience, as I may &s;ay, awake, I &s;inn'd, knowing it to be a Sin, but having no Power to re&s;i&s;t; when this had thus made a Hole in my Heart, and I was come to &s;uch a Height, as to tran&s;gre&s;s again&s;t the Light of my own Con&s;cience, I was then fit for any Wickedne&s;s, and Con&s;cience left off &s;peaking, where it found it could not be heard.</P>
<P>But to return to our Story; having con&s;ented, as a|bove, to his Propo&s;al, we had not much more to do; he gave me my Writings, and the Bond for my Main|tenance during his Life, and for 500 <HI>l.</HI> after his Death; and &s;o far was he from abating his Affection to me af|terwards, that two Years after we were thus, as he call'd it, marry'd, he made his Will, and gave me a thou|&s;and Pounds more, and all my Hou&s;hold &s;tuff, Plate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which was con&s;iderable too.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> put us to Bed, and my new Friend, I cannot call him Husband, was &s;o well plea&s;ed with <HI>Amy</HI> for her Fidelity and Kindne&s;s to me, that he paid her all the Arrear of her Wages that I ow'd her, and gave her five Guineas over, and had it gone no farther, <HI>Amy</HI> had richly de&s;erved what &s;he had, for never was a Maid &s;o true to a Mi&s;tre&s;s in &s;uch dreadful Circum&s;tances as I was in; nor was what followed more her own Fault

<P>We liv'd, &s;urely, the mo&s;t agreeable Life, the grand Exception only excepted, that ever two lived together; he was the mo&s;t obliging gentlemanly Man, and the mo&s;t tender of me, that ever Woman gave her&s;elf up to; nor was there ever the lea&s;t Interruption to our mutual Kindne&s;s, no, not to the la&s;t Day of his Life: But I mu&s;t b$ing <HI>Amy</HI>'s Di&s;a&s;ter in at once, that I may have done with her.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was dre&s;&s;ing me one Morning, for now I had two Maids, and <HI>Amy</HI> was my Chamber-Maid. Dear Ma|dam, <HI>&s;ays</HI> Amy, what a'n't you with Child yet? No, <HI>Amy,</HI> &s;ays I, nor any Sign of it: Law, Madam, <HI>&s;ays</HI> Amy, what have you been doing? Why you have been married a Year and a half, I warrant you, Ma&s;ter would have got me with Child twice in that Time: It may be &s;o, <HI>Amy,</HI> &s;ays I, let him try, can't you: No, <HI>&s;ays</HI> Amy, you'll &s;orbid it now; before I told you he &s;hould with all my Heart, but I won't now, now he's all your own: O, <HI>&s;ays I, Amy,</HI> I'll freely give you my Con&s;ent, it will be nothing at all to me; nay, I'll put you to Bed to him my&s;elf one Night or other, if you are willing: No, Madam, no, <HI>&s;ays Amy,</HI> not now he's yours.</P>
<P>Why you Fool you, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> don't I tell you I'll put you to Bed to him my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Nay, nay, <HI>&s;ays</HI> Amy, if you put me to Bed to him, that is another Ca&s;e; I believe I &s;hall not ri&s;e again very &s;oon.</P>
<P>I'll venture that, <HI>Amy,</HI> &s;ays I.</P>
<P>After Supper, that Night, and before we were ri&s;en from the Table, <HI>I &s;aid to him, Amy</HI> being by, Hark ye, Mr.&mdash;, Do you know that you are to lye with <HI>Amy</HI> to Night? No, not I, <HI>&s;ays he;</HI> but turns to <HI>Amy,</HI> Is it &s;o, <HI>Amy,</HI> &s;ays he? No, Sir, <HI>&s;ays &s;he;</HI> Nay, don't

&s;ay no, you Fool; did not I promi&s;e to put you to B$i to him? But the Girl &s;aid No &s;till, and it pa&s;s'd off.</P>
<P>At Night, when we came to go to Bed, <HI>Amy</HI> came into the Chamber to undre&s;s me, and her Ma&s;ter &s;lipt into Bed fir&s;t; then I began, and told him all that <HI>A|my</HI> had &s;aid about my not being with Child, and of her being with Child twice in that Time: Ay, Mrs. <HI>Amy, &s;ays he,</HI> I believe &s;o too, come hither, and we'll try; but <HI>Amy</HI> did not go: Go, you Fool, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> can't you, I freely give you both Leave; but <HI>Amy</HI> would not go: Nay, you Whore, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> you &s;aid, if I would put you to Bed, you would with all your Heart. And with that, I &s;at her down, pull'd off her Stockings and Shoes, and all her Cloaths, Piece by Piece, and led her to the Bed to him; <HI>Here,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>try what you can do with your Maid</HI> Amy: She pull'd back a little, would not let me pull off her Cloaths at fir&s;t, but it was hot Weather, and &s;he had not many Cloaths on, and par|ticularly no Stays on; and at la&s;t, when &s;he &s;aw I was in earne&s;t, &s;he let me do what I would; &s;o I &s;airly &s;tript her, and then I threw open the Bed, and thru&s;t her in.</P>
<P>I need &s;ay no more; this is enough to convince any Body that I did not think him my Husband, and that I had ca&s;t off all Principle, and all Mode&s;ty, and had effectually &s;tifled Con&s;cience.</P>
<P><HI>Amy,</HI> I dare &s;ay, began now to repent, and would &s;ain have got out of Bed again; but he &s;aid to her, Nay, <HI>Amy,</HI> you &s;ee your Mi&s;tre&s;s has put you to Bed, 'tis all her doing, you mu&s;t blame her; &s;o he held her fa&s;t, and the Wench being naked in the Bed with him, 'twas too late to look back, &s;o &s;he lay &s;till and let him do what he would with her.</P>
<P>Had I look'd upon my&s;elf as a Wife, you cannot &s;up|po&s;e I would have been willing to have let my Hus|band lye with my Maid, much le&s;s before my Face, for I &s;tood by all the while; but as I thought my&s;elf a Whore, I cannot &s;ay but that it was &s;omething de&s;ign|ed in my Thoughts, that my Maid &s;hould be a Whore too, and &s;hould not reproach me with it.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="51">
<HI>Amy,</HI> however, le&s;s vicious than I, was grievou&s;ly out of Sorts the next Morning, and cryed and took on mo&s;t vehemently; that &s;he was ruin'd and undone, and there was no paci&s;ying her; &s;he was a Whore, a Slut, and &s;he was undone! undone! and cry'd almo&s;t all Day; I did all I could to paci&s;y her: A Whore, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> well, and am not I a Whore as well as you? No, no, <HI>&s;ays</HI> Amy, no, you are not, for you are married; not I, <HI>Amy,</HI> &s;ays I, I do not pretend to it; he may marry you to Morrow if he will, for any Thing I could do to hinder it, I am not marry'd; I do not look up|on it as any Thing: Well, all did not pacify <HI>Amy,</HI> but &s;he cryed two or three Days about it; but it wore off by Degrees.</P>
<P>But the Ca&s;e differ'd between <HI>Amy</HI> and her Ma&s;ter, exceedingly; for <HI>Amy</HI> retain'd the &s;ame kind Temper &s;he always had; but on the contrary, he was quite al|tered, for he hated her heartily, and could, I believe, have killed her after it, and he told me &s;o, for he thought this a vile Action; whereas what he and I had done he was perfectly ea&s;y in, thought it ju&s;t, and e&s;|teem'd me as much his Wife as if we had been mar|ry'd from our Youth, and had neither of us known a|ny other; nay, he lov'd me, I believe, as entirely as if I had been the Wife of his Youth; nay, he told me it was true, in one Sen&s;e, that he had two Wives, but that I was the Wife of his Affection, the other, the Wife of his Aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>I was extreamly concern'd at the Aver&s;ion he had taken to my Maid <HI>Amy,</HI> and us'd my utmo&s;t Skill to get it alter'd; for tho' he had, indeed, debauch'd the Wench, I knew that I was the principal Occa&s;ion of it; and as he was the be&s;t humour'd Man in the World, I never gave him over till I prevail'd with him to be ea&s;y with her, and as I was now become the Devil's Agent, to make others as wicked as my&s;elf, I brought him to lye with her again &s;everal Times after that, till at la&s;t, as the poor Girl &s;aid, &s;o it happen'd, and &s;he was really with Child.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="52">
She was terribly concern'd at it, and &s;o was he too: Come, my Dear, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> when <HI>Rachael</HI> put her Hand|maid to Bed to <HI>Jacoh,</HI> &s;he took the Children as her own; don't be unea&s;y, I'll take the Child as my own; had not I a Hand in the Frolick of putting her to Bed to you? It was my Fault as much as yours; &s;o I call'd <HI>Amy,</HI> and encourag'd her too, and told her that I would take Care of the Child and her too, and added the &s;ame Argument to her; for, <HI>&s;ays I, Amy,</HI> it was all my Fault; did not I drag your Cloaths off your Back, and put you to Bed to him: Thus I that had, indeed, been the Cau&s;e of all the Wickedne&s;s between them, en|couraged them both, when they had any Remor&s;e a|bout it, and rather prompted them to go on with it, than to repent of it.</P>
<P>When <HI>Amy</HI> grew big, &s;he went to a Place I had pro|vided for her, and the Neighbours knew nothing but that <HI>Amy</HI> and I was parted. She had a fine Child in|deed, a Daughter, and we had it nurs'd, and <HI>Amy</HI> came again in about half a Year, to live with her old Mi&s;tre&s;s; but neither my Gentleman, or <HI>Amy</HI> either, car'd for playing that Game over again; for as he &s;aid, the Jade might bring him a Hou&s;e full of Children to keep.</P>
<P>We liv'd as merrily, and as happily after this, as could be expected, con&s;idering our Circum&s;tances; I mean as to the pretended Marriage, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and as to that my Gentleman had not the lea&s;t Concern about him for it; but as much as I was harden'd, and that was as much as, I believe, ever any wicked Creature was, yet I could not help it, there was, and would be, Hours of Intervals, and of dark Reflections which came invo|luntarily in, and thru&s;t in Sighs into the middle of all my Songs; and there would be, &s;ometimes, a Heavine&s;s of Heart, which intermingled it&s;elf with all my Joy, and which wou'd often fetch a Tear from my Eye; and let others pretend what they will, I believe it impo&s;&s;ible to be otherwi&s;e with any-body; there can be no &s;ub|&s;tantial Satisfaction in a Life of known Wickedne&s;s; Con&s;cience will, and does, often break in upon them
<PB N="55" REF="53">
at particular Times, let them do what they can to pre|vent it.</P>
<P>But I am not to preach, but to relate, and whatever loo&s;e Reflections were, and how often &s;oever tho&s;e dark Intervals came on, I did my utmo&s;t to conceal them from him; ay, and to &s;uppre&s;s and &s;mother them too in my&s;elf, and to outward Appearance we liv'd as chear|fully, and as agreeably, as it was po&s;&s;ible for any Cou|ple in the World to live.</P>
<P>After I had thus liv'd with him &s;omething above two Years, truly, I found my&s;elf with Child too; my Gen|tleman was mightily pleas'd at it, and nothing could be kinder than he was in the Preparations he made for me, and for my Lying in, which was, however, very private, becau&s;e I car'd for as little Company as po&s;&s;i|ble; nor had I kept up my neighbourly Acquaintance; &s;o that I had no-body to invite upon &s;uch an Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I was brought to-bed very well, (of a Daughter too, as well as <HI>Amy)</HI> but the Child died at about &s;ix Weeks old, &s;o all that Work was to do over again, that is to &s;ay, the Charge, the Expence, the Travel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The next Year I made him amends, and brought him a Son, to his great Satisfaction; it was a charming Child, and did very well: After this, my Husband, as he called him&s;elf, came to me one Evening, and told me, he had a very difficult Thing happen'd to him, which he knew not what to do in, or how to re|&s;olve about, unle&s;s I would make him ea&s;y; this was, that his Occa&s;ions requir'd him to go over to <HI>France</HI> for about two Months.</P>
<P>Well, my Dear, &s;ays I, and how &s;hall I make you ea&s;y?</P>
<P>Why, by con&s;enting to let me go, &s;ays he, upon which Condition, I'll tell you the Occa&s;ion of my go|ing, that you may judge of the Nece&s;&s;ity there is for it on my Side; then to make me ea&s;y in his going, he told me, he would make his Will before he went, which &s;hould be to my full Satisfaction.</P>
<P>I told him the la&s;t Part was &s;o kind, that I could not decline the fir&s;t Part, unle&s;s he would give me
<PB N="56" REF="54">
Leave to add, that if it was not for putting him to an extraordinary Expence, I would go over along with him.</P>
<P>He was &s;o plea&s;ed with this Offer, that he told me, he would give me full Satisfaction for it, and accept of it too; &s;o he took me to <HI>London</HI> with him the next Day, and there he made his Will, and &s;hew'd it to me, and &s;eal'd it before proper Witne&s;&s;es, and then gave it to me to keep: In this Will he gave a thou&s;and Pounds to a Per&s;on that we both knew very well, in Tru&s;t, to pay it, with the Intere&s;t from the Time of his Decea&s;e, to me, or my A&s;&s;igns; then he will'd the Payment of my Jointure, as he call'd it, <HI>viz.</HI> his Bond of a Hun|dred Pounds, after his Death; al&s;o he gave me all my Hou&s;hold-&s;tuff, Plate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This was a mo&s;t engaging Thing for a Man to do to one under my Circum&s;tances; and it would have been hard, as I told him, to deny him any Thing, or to refu&s;e to go with him any where; &s;o we &s;ettled every Thing as well as we cou'd; left <HI>Amy</HI> in Charge with the Hou&s;e; and for his other Bu&s;ine&s;s, which was in Jewels, he had two Men he entru&s;ted, whom he had good Security for, and who managed for him, and corre&s;ponded with him.</P>
<P>Things being thus concerted, we went away to <HI>France,</HI> arriv'd &s;afe at <HI>Calais,</HI> and by ea&s;y Journeys, came in eight Days more to <HI>Paris,</HI> where we lodg'd in the Hou&s;e of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchant of his Acquain|tance, and was very courteou&s;ly entertain'd.</P>
<P>My Gentleman's Bu&s;ine&s;s was with &s;ome Per&s;ons of the fir&s;t Rank, and to whom he had &s;old &s;ome Jewels of very good Value, and receiv'd a great Sum of Mo|ney in Specie, and, as he told me privately, he gain'd 3000 Pi&s;toles by his Bargain, but would not &s;uffer the mo&s;t intimate Friend he had there, to know what he had receiv'd; for it is not &s;o &s;afe a Thing in <HI>Paris,</HI> to have a great Sum of Money in keeping, as it might be in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>We made this Journey much longer than we intend|ed; and my Gentleman &s;ent for one of his Managers

in <HI>London,</HI> to come over to us to <HI>Paris</HI> with &s;ome Dia|monds, and &s;ent him back to <HI>London</HI> again to fetch more; then other Bu&s;ine&s;s fell into his Hands &s;o unex|pectedly, that I began to think we &s;hould take up our con&s;tant Re&s;idence there, which I was not very aver&s;e to, it being my Native Country, and I &s;poke the Lan|guage perfectly well; &s;o we took a good Hou&s;e in <HI>Pa|ris,</HI> and lived very well there; and I &s;ent for <HI>Amy</HI> to come over to me, for I lived gallantly, and my Gen|tleman was two or three Times going to keep me a Coach, but I declined it, e&s;pecially at <HI>Paris;</HI> but as they have tho&s;e Conveniencies by the Day there, at a certain Rate, I had an Equipage provided for me whenever I plea&s;ed, and I lived here in a very good Figure, and might have lived higher if I plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>But in the middle of all this Felicity, a dreadful Di&s;a&s;ter befel me, which entirely unhing'd all my Af|fairs, and threw me back into the &s;ame State of Life that I was in before; with this one happy Exception however, that whereas before I was poor, even to Mi&s;ery, now I was not only provided for, but very rich.</P>
<P>My Gentleman had the Name in <HI>Paris,</HI> for a very rich Man, and indeed, he was &s;o, though not &s;o im|men&s;ely rich as People imagin'd; but that which was fatal to him, was, that he generally carried a &s;hagreen Ca&s;e in his Pocket, e&s;pecially when he went to Court, or to the Hou&s;es of any of the Princes of the Blood, in which he had Jewels of very great Value.</P>
<P>It happen'd one Day, that being to go to <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> to wait upon the Prince of&mdash;, he came up into my Chamber in the Morning, and laid out his Jewel|ca&s;e, becau&s;e he was not going to &s;how any Jewels, but to get a Foreign Bill accepted, which he had received from <HI>Am&s;terdam;</HI> &s;o when he gave me the Ca&s;e, he &s;aid, my Dear, I think I need not carry this with me, becau&s;e, it may be, I may not come back till Night, and it is too much to venture; I return'd, then my Dear, you &s;ha'n't go; Why? &s;ays he; becau&s;e as they are too much for you, &s;o you are too much for me to

venture; and you &s;hall not go, unle&s;s you will pro|mi&s;e me not to &s;tay &s;o as to come back in the Night.</P>
<P>I hope there's no Danger, &s;aid he, &s;eeing I have no|thing about me of any Value; and therefore, le&s;t I &s;hould, take that too, &s;ays he, and gives me his Gold Watch, and a rich Diamond, which he had in a Ring, and always wore on his Finger.</P>
<P>Well, but my Dear, &s;ays I, you make me more un|ca&s;y now, than before; for if you apprehend no Dan|ger, why do you u&s;e this Caution? and if you appre|hend there is Danger, why do you go at all?</P>
<P>There is no Danger, &s;ays he, if I do not &s;tay late, and I do not de&s;ign to do &s;o.</P>
<P>Well, but promi&s;e me then, that you won't, &s;ays I, or el&s;e I cannot let you go.</P>
<P>I wont, indeed, my Dear, &s;ays he, unle&s;s I am oblig'd to it; I a&s;&s;ure you I do not intend it; but if I &s;hou'd, I am not worth robbing now; for I have no|thing about me, but about &s;ix Pi&s;toles in my little Pur&s;e, and that Ring, &s;howing me a &s;mall Diamond Ring, worth about ten or twelve Pi&s;toles, which he put upon his Finger, in the Room of the rich one he u&s;ually wore.</P>
<P>I &s;till pre&s;s'd him not to &s;tay late, and he &s;aid he wou'd not; but if I am kept late, &s;ays he, beyond my Expectation, I'll &s;tay all Night, and come next Mor|ning: This &s;eem'd a very good Caution; but &s;till my Mind was very unea&s;y about him, and I told him &s;o, and entreated him not to go; I told him, I did not know what might be the Rea&s;on, but that I had a &s;trange Terror upon my Mind, about his going, and that, if he did go, I was per&s;waded &s;ome Harm wou'd attend him; he &s;mil'd, and return'd, Well, my Dear, if it &s;hould be &s;o, you are now richly provided for; all that I have here, I give to you; and with that, he takes up the Casket, or Ca&s;e, Here, &s;ays he, hold your Hand, there is a good E&s;tate for you, in this Ca&s;e; if any Thing happens to me, 'tis all your own, I give it you for your&s;elf; and with that, he put the Casket, the fine Ring, and his Gold Watch, all into

my Hands, and the Key of his Scrutore be&s;ides, adding, and in my Scruture there is &s;ome Money, 'tis all your own.</P>
<P>I &s;tar'd at him, as if I was frighted, for I thought all his Face look'd like a Death's-Head; and then, immediately, I thought I perceiv'd his Head all bloody; and then his Cloaths look'd bloody too; and immedi|ately it all went off, and he look'd as he really did; im|mediately I fell a crying, and hung about him, my Dear, &s;aid I, I am frighted to Death; you &s;hall not go, depend upon it, &s;ome Mi&s;chief will befal you; I did not tell him how my vapouri&s;h Fancy had repre&s;ented him to me, that I thought was not proper; be&s;ides, he wou'd only have laugh'd at me, and wou'd have gone away with a Je&s;t about it: But I pre&s;s'd him &s;eriou&s;ly not to go that Day, or if he did, to promi&s;e me to come Home to <HI>Paris</HI> again by Day-light: He look'd a little graver then, than he did before; told me, he was not apprehen&s;ive of the lea&s;t Danger; but if there was, he wou'd either take Care to come in the Day, or, as he had &s;aid before, wou'd &s;tay all Night.</P>
<P>But all the&s;e Promi&s;es came to nothing; for he was &s;et upon in the open Day, and robb'd, by three Men on Hor&s;eback, mask'd, as he went; and one of them, who, it &s;eems, ri&s;ted him, while the re&s;t &s;tood to &s;top the Coach, &s;tabb'd him into the Body with a Sword, &s;o that he died immediately: He had a Footman be|hind the Coach, whom they knock'd down with the Stock, or But-end of a Carabine: They were &s;uppos'd to kill him, becau&s;e of the Di&s;appointment they met with, in not getting his Ca&s;e, or Casket of Diamonds, which they knew he carry'd about him; and this was &s;uppos'd, becau&s;e after they had kill'd him, they made the Coachman drive out of the Road, a long Way over the Heath, till they came to a convenient Place, where they pull'd him out of the Coach, and &s;earch'd his Cloaths more narrowly, than they cou'd do while he was alive.</P>
<P>But they found nothing but his little Ring, &s;ix Pi|&s;toles, and the Value of about &s;even Livres in &s;mall Moneys.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="58">
This was a dreadful Blow to me; tho' I cannot &s;ay I was &s;o &s;urpriz'd as I &s;hould otherwi&s;e have been; for all the while he was gone, my Mind was oppre&s;s'd with the Weight of my own Thoughts; and I was as &s;ure that I &s;hould never &s;ee him any more, that I think nothing could be like it; the Impre&s;&s;ion was &s;o &s;trong, that, I think, nothing could make &s;o deep a Wound, that was imaginary; and I was &s;o dejected, and di&s;con|&s;olate, that when I receiv'd the News of his Di&s;a&s;ter, there was no Room for any extraordinary Alteration in me: I had cry'd all that Day, eat nothing, and only waited, as I might &s;ay, to receive the di&s;mal News, which I had brought to me about five a Clock in the Afternoon.</P>
<P>I was in a &s;trange Country; and tho' I had a pretty many Acquaintances, had but very few Friends that I could con&s;ult on this Occa&s;ion; all po&s;&s;ible Enquiry was made after the Rogues, that had been thus barbarous, but nothing could be heard of them; nor was it po&s;&s;ible, that the Footman could make any Di&s;covery of them, by his De&s;cription; for they knock'd him down im|mediately, &s;o that he knew nothing of what was done afterwards; the Coachman was the only Man that cou'd &s;ay any Thing, and all his Account amounted to no more than this, that one of them had Soldiers Cloaths, but he cou'd not remember the Particulars of his mount|ing, &s;o as to know what Regiment he belong'd to; and as to their Faces, that he could know nothing of, be|cau&s;e they had all of them Masks on.</P>
<P>I had him buried as decently as the Place would permit a prote&s;tant Stranger to be buried, and made &s;ome of the Scruples and Difficulties on that Account, ea&s;y, by the Help of Money to a certain Per&s;on, who went impudently to the Curate of the Pari&s;h St. <HI>Sal|pitius,</HI> in <HI>Paris,</HI> and told him, that the Gentleman that was kill'd, was a Catholick; that the Thieves had taken from him a Cro&s;s of Gold, &s;et with Diamonds, worth 6000 Livres; that his Widow was a Catholick, and had &s;ent by him 60 Crowns to the Church of&mdash;, for Ma&s;&s;es to be &s;aid for the Repo&s;e of his Soul: Upon

all which, <HI>tho' not one Word of it was true,</HI> he was bu|ried with all the Ceremonies of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church.</P>
<P>I think I almo&s;t cry'd my &s;elf to Death for him; for I abandon'd my&s;elf to all the Exce&s;&s;es of Grief; and indeed, I lov'd him to a Degree inexpre&s;&s;ible; and con&s;idering what Kindne&s;s he had &s;hewn me at fir&s;t, and how tenderly he had us'd me to the la&s;t, what cou'd I do Ie&s;s?</P>
<P>Then the Manner of his Death was terrible and fright|ful to me, and above all, the &s;trange Notices I had of it; I had never pretended to the Second-Sight, or any Thing of the Kind; but certainly, if any one ever had &s;uch a Thing, I had it at this Time; for I &s;aw him as plainly in all tho&s;e terrible Shapes, as above, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> as a Skeleton, not dead only, but rotten and wa&s;ted; <HI>Se|condly,</HI> as kill'd, and his Face bloody; and <HI>Thirdly,</HI> his Cloaths bloody; and all within the Space of one Minute, or indeed, of a very few Moments.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things amaz'd me, and I was a good-while as one &s;tupid; however, after &s;ome Time, I began to recover and look into my Affairs; I had the Satisfaction not to be left in Di&s;tre&s;s, or in Danger of Poverty; on the contrary, be&s;ides what he had put into my Hands fairly, in his Life-Time, which amounted to a very con&s;iderable Value, I found above &s;even Hundred Pi|&s;toles in Gold, in his Scrutore; of which he had given me the Key; and I found foreign Bills accepted, for about 12000 Livres: &s;o that, in a Word, I found my|&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of almo&s;t ten Thou&s;and Pounds Sterling, in a very few Days after the Di&s;a&s;ter.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Thing I did upon this Occa&s;ion, was, to &s;end a Letter to my Maid, as I &s;till call'd her, <HI>Amy;</HI> wherein I gave her an Account of my Di&s;a&s;ter; how my Husband, as &s;he call'd him <HI>(for I never call'd him &s;o)</HI> was murther'd; and as I did not know how his Re|lations, or his Wife's Friends, might act upon this Oc|ca&s;ion, I order'd her to convey away all the Plate, Lin|nen, and other Things of Value, and to &s;ecure them in a Per&s;on's Hands that I directed her to, and then to &s;ell, or di&s;po&s;e the Furniture of the Hou&s;e, if &s;he could; and &s;o, without acquainting any-body with the Rea&s;on

of her going, withdraw; &s;ending Notice to his Head Manager at <HI>London,</HI> that the Hou&s;e was quitted by the Tenant, and they might come and take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it for the Executors: <HI>Amy</HI> was &s;o dext'rous, and did her Work &s;o nimbly, that &s;he gutted the Hou&s;e, and &s;ent the Key to the &s;aid Manager, almo&s;t as &s;oon as he had Notice of the Misfortune that befel their Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Upon their receiving the &s;urprizing News of his Death, the Head Manager came over to <HI>Paris,</HI> and came to the Hou&s;e; I made no Scruple of calling my|&s;elf Madam&mdash;, the Widow of Mon&s;ieur&mdash;, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Jeweller; and as I &s;poke <HI>French</HI> naturally, I did not let him know but that I was his Wife, mar|ried in <HI>France,</HI> and that I had not heard that he had any Wife in <HI>England;</HI> but pretended to be &s;urpriz'd, and exclaim again&s;t him for &s;o ba&s;e an Action; and that I had good Friends in <HI>Poictou,</HI> where I was born, who would take Care to have Ju&s;tice done me in <HI>England,</HI> out of his E&s;tate.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have ob&s;erv'd, that as &s;oon as the News was publick, of a Man being murder'd, and that he was a Jeweller, Fame did me the Favour as to publi&s;h pre|&s;ently, that he was robb'd of his Casket of Jewels, which he always carry'd about him. I confirm'd this, among my daily Lamentations for his Di&s;a&s;ter, and added, that he had with him a fine Diamond Ring, which he was known to wear frequently about him, valued at 100 Pi&s;toles, a Gold Watch, and a great Quantity of Diamonds of ine&s;timable Value, in his Casket; which-Jewels he was carrying to the Prince of&mdash;, to &s;how &s;ome of them to him; and the Prince own'd, that he had &s;poken to him to bring &s;ome &s;uch Jewels, to let him &s;ee them. But I &s;orely repented this Part afterward, as you &s;hall hear.</P>
<P>This Rumour put an End to all Enquiry after his Jewels, his Ring, or his Watch; and as for the 700 Pi&s;toles, that I &s;ecur'd: For the Bills which were in Hand, I own'd I had them; but that, as <HI>I &s;aid,</HI> I brought my Husband 30000 Livres Portion, I claim'd the &s;aid Bills, which came to not above 12000 Livres, for my <HI>Amende;</HI> and this, with the Plate, and the Hou|&s;hold-Stuff,

was the principal of all his E&s;tate which they could come at; as to the Foreign-Bill, which he was going to <HI>Ver&s;ailles</HI> to get accepted, it was really lo&s;t with him; but his Manager, who had remitted the Bill to him, by Way of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> bringing over the &s;econd Bill, the Money was &s;av'd, as they call'd it, which would, otherwi&s;e, have been al&s;o gone; the Thieves who robb'd and murther'd him, were, to be &s;ure, afraid to &s;end any body to get the Bill accepted; for that would undoubtedly have di&s;cover'd them.</P>
<P>By this Time my Maid <HI>Amy</HI> was arriv'd, and &s;he gave me an Account of her Management, and how &s;he had &s;ecur'd every thing, and that &s;he had quitted the Hou&s;e, and &s;ent the Key to the Head-Manager of his Bu&s;ine&s;s; and let me know how much &s;he had made of every Thing, very punctually and hone&s;tly.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have ob&s;erv'd in the Account of his dwelling with me &s;o long at&mdash;, that he never pa&s;s'd for any Thing there, but a Lodger in the Hou&s;e; and tho' he was Landlord, that did not alter the Ca&s;e; &s;o that at his Death, <HI>Amy</HI> coming to quit the Hou&s;e, and give them the Key, there was no Affinity between that, and the Ca&s;e of their Ma&s;ter, who was newly kill'd.</P>
<P>I got good Advice at <HI>Paris,</HI> from an eminent Lawyer, a Coun&s;ellor of the Parliament there, and laying my Ca&s;e before him, he directed me to make a Proce&s;s in Dower upon the E&s;tate, for making good my new Fortune upon Matrimony, which accordingly I did; and, upon the whole, the Manager went back to <HI>Eng|land,</HI> well &s;atisfied, that he had gotten the unaccepted Bills of Exchange, which was for 2500l. with &s;ome other things, which together, amounted to 17000 Li|vies; and thus I got rid of him.</P>

Accident, which he made a long Story of, had pre|vented him.</P>
<P>By the Concour&s;e of Ladies and others, that thus came to vi&s;it me, I began to be much known; and as I did not forget to &s;et my&s;elf out with all po&s;&s;ible Ad|vantage, con&s;idering the Dre&s;s of a Widow, which in tho&s;e Days was a mo&s;t frightful Thing; I &s;ay, as I did thus from my own Vanity, for I was not ignorant that I was very hand&s;ome; I &s;ay, on this Account, I was &s;oon made very publick, and was known by the Name of <HI>La Belle veufeu de Poictou;</HI> or, the pretty Widow of <HI>Poictou:</HI> As I was very well plea&s;ed to &s;ee my&s;elf thus hand&s;omely us'd in my Affliction, it &s;oon dry'd up all my Tears; and tho' I appear'd as a Widow, yet, as we &s;ay in <HI>England,</HI> it was of a Widow comforted: I took Care to let the Ladies &s;ee, that I knew how to receive them; that I was not at a Lo&s;s how to behave to any of them; and in &s;hort, I began to be very po|pular there; but I had an Occa&s;ion afterwards, which made me decline that Kind of Management, as you &s;hall hear pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>About four Days after I had receiv'd the Compli|ments of Condolance from the Prince&mdash;, the &s;ame Gentleman he had &s;ent before, came to tell me, that his Highne&s;s was coming to give me a Vi&s;it; I was indeed &s;urpriz'd at that, and perfectly at a Lo&s;s how to behave: However, as there was no Remedy, I prepar'd to receive him as well as I cou'd; it was not many Minutes after, but he was at the Door, and came in, introduc'd by his own Gentleman, as above, and after by my Woman <HI>Amy.</HI></P>
<P>He treated me with abundance of Civility, and con|dol'd hand&s;omely the Lo&s;s of my Husband, and like|wi&s;e the Manner of it; he told me, he under&s;tood he was coming to <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> to him&s;elf, to &s;hew him &s;ome Jewels; that it was true, that he had di&s;cours'd with him about Jewels, but could not imagine how any Villains &s;hou'd hear of his coming at that Time with them; that he had not order'd him to attend with them at <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> but told him, that he would come to <HI>Paris</HI> by &s;uch a Day, &s;o that he was no Way acce&s;&s;ary to

<P>You may be &s;ure I behav'd with a due Sen&s;e of &s;o much Goodne&s;s, and offer'd to kneel to ki&s;s his Hand, but he took me up, and &s;aluted me, and &s;at down a|gain, <HI>(tho' before, he made as if he was going away,)</HI> making me &s;it down by him.</P>
<P>He then began to talk with me more familiarly; told me, he hop'd I was not left in bad Circum&s;tances; that Mr.&mdash;was reputed to be very rich, and that he had gain'd lately great Sums by &s;ome Jewels; and he hop'd, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> that I had &s;till a Fortune agreeable to the Condition I had liv'd in before.</P>
<P>I reply'd, with &s;ome Tears, which, I confe&s;s, were a little forc'd, that I believ'd if Mr.&mdash;had liv'd, we &s;hou'd have been out of Danger of Want; but that it was impo&s;&s;ible to e&s;timate the Lo&s;s which I had &s;u&s;|tain'd, be&s;ides that of the Life of my Husband; that by the Opinion of tho&s;e that knew &s;omething of his Affairs, and of what Value the Jewels were which he intended to have &s;hown to <HI>his Highne&s;s,</HI> he could not have le&s;s about him, than the Value of a hundred Thou&s;and Li|$$es; that it was a fatal Blow to me, and to his whole Fa|mily, e&s;pecially that they &s;hould be lo&s;t in &s;uch a Manner.</P>

<P>He &s;aid &s;ome very kind Things to me after this, and &s;at down with me, for an Hour, or more; when get|ting-up, and calling his Gentleman, by his Name, he threw open the Door, <HI>Au Boir, &s;ays he;</HI> upon which, his Gentleman immediately brought up a little Table, cover'd with a fine damask Cloth, the Table no bigger than he cou'd bring in his two Hands; but upon it, was &s;et two Decanters, one of Champaign, and the other of Water, &s;ix &s;ilver Plates, and a Service of fine Sweet-Meats in fine <HI>China</HI> Di&s;hes, on a Sett of Rings &s;tanding up about twenty Inches high, one above another; below, was three roa&s;ted Partriges, and a Quail; as &s;oon as his Gentleman had &s;et it all down, he order'd him to with|draw; now, <HI>&s;ays the Prince,</HI> I intend to &s;up with you.</P>
<P>When he &s;ent away his Gentleman, I &s;tood up and of|fer'd to wait on his Highne&s;s while he eat, but he po&s;i|tively refu&s;ed, and told me no, to-morrow you &s;hall be the Widow of Mon&s;ieur&mdash;, the Jeweller, but to Night you &s;hall be my Mi&s;tre&s;s; therefore &s;it here, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> and eat with me, or I will get up and &s;erve.</P>

I would then have call'd up my Woman <HI>Amy,</HI> but I thought that would not be proper neither; &s;o I made my Excu&s;e, that &s;ince his Highne&s;s would not let his own Servant wait, I would not pre&s;ume to let my Woman come up; but if he would plea&s;e to let me wait, it would be my Honour to fill his Highne&s;s's Wine; but, as before, he would by no Means allow me; &s;o we &s;at and eat together.</P>
<P>Now, Madam, <HI>&s;ays the Prince,</HI> give me Leave to lay a&s;ide my Character; let us talk together with the Freedom of Equals; my Quality &s;ets me at a Di&s;tance from you, and makes you ceremonious; your Beauty ex|alts you to more than an Equality, I mu&s;t then treat you as Lovers do their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, but I cannot &s;peak the Language; 'tis enough to tell you how agreeable you are to me; how I am &s;urprized at your Beauty, and re|&s;olve to make you happy, and to be happy with you.</P>
<P>I knew not what to &s;ay to him a good while, but blu&s;h'd, and looking up towards him, &s;aid I was already made happy, in the Favour of a Per&s;on of &s;uch Rank; and had nothing to ask of his Highne&s;s, but that he would believe me infinitely obliged.</P>
<P>After he had eaten, he pour'd the Sweet-meats into my Lap; and the Wine being out, he called his Gentle|man again to take away the Table, who, at fir&s;t, only took the Cloth and the Remains of what was to eat, a|way; and laying another Cloth &s;et the Table on one Side of the Room, with a noble Service of Plate upon it, worth, at lea&s;t, 200 Pi&s;toles; then having &s;et the two Decanters again upon the Table, fill'd, as before, he withdrew, for I found the Fellow under&s;tood his Bu|&s;ine&s;s very well, and his Lord's Bu&s;ine&s;s too.</P>
<P>About half an Hour after, the Prince told me, that I offer'd to wait a little before; that if I would now take $he Trouble, he would give me leave to give him &s;ome Wine; &s;o I went to the Table, filled a Gla&s;s of Wine, $nd brought it to him on a fine Salver, which the Gla&s;&s;es $tood on, and brought the Bottle or Decanter for Water $n my other Hand, to mix it as he thought fit.</P>
<P>He &s;miled, and bid me look on that Salver, which I lid, and admir'd it much, for it was a very fine one in|deed:

You may &s;ee, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I re&s;olve to have more of your Company, for my Servant &s;hall leave you that Plate for my U&s;e: I told him, I believed his Highne&s;s would not take it ill, that I was not furni&s;hed fit to en|tertain a Per&s;on of his Rank; and that I would take great Care of it, and value my&s;elf infinitely upon the Honour of his Highne&s;s's Vi&s;it.</P>
<P>It now began to grow late, and he began to take No|tice of it; but, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I cannot leave you; have you not a &s;pare Lodging for one Night? I told him I had but a homely Lodging to entertain &s;uch a Gue&s;t; he &s;aid &s;omething exceeding kind on that Head, but not &s;it to repeat; adding, that my Company would make him amends.</P>
<P>About Midnight he &s;ent his Gentleman of an Errand, after telling him aloud that he intended to &s;tay here all Night; in a little Time his Gentleman brought him a Night-gown, Slippers, two Caps, a Neck-cloth and Shirt, which he gave me to carry into his Chamber, and &s;ent his Man Home; and then turning to me, &s;aid, I &s;hould do him the Honour to be his Chamberlain of the Hou&s;hold, and his Dre&s;&s;er al&s;o.

<P>About One in the Morning, while his Gentleman was yet with him, I begg'd Leave to withdraw, &s;up|po&s;ing he would go to Bed; but he took the Hint, and &s;aid I am not going to Bed yet; pray let me &s;ee you a|gain.</P>
<P>I took this Time to undre&s;s me, and to come in a new Dre&s;s, which was, in a Manner, <HI>une Di&s;habile,</HI> but &s;o fine, and all about me &s;o clean and &s;o agreeable, that he &s;eemed &s;urpri&s;ed: I thought, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> you could not have dre&s;s'd to more Advantage than you had done before; but now, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> you charm me a thou&s;and times more, if that be po&s;&s;ible.</P>

and with that, he took me in his Arms,&mdash;I can go no other in the Particulars of what pa&s;&s;ed at that Time; $ended in this, in &s;hort, I lay with him all Night.</P>
<P>I have given you the whole Detail of this Story, to by it down as a black Scheme of the Way, how un|happy Women are ruined by great Men; for, tho' Po|$erty and Want is an irre&s;i&s;tible Temptation to the Poor, $$anity and great Things are as irre&s;i&s;tible to others; $ be courted by a Prince, and by a Prince who was fir&s;t $ Benefactor, then an Admirer; to be called hand&s;ome, he &s;ine&s;t Woman in <HI>France,</HI> and to be treated as a Wo|man &s;it for the Bed of a Prince; the&s;e are Things, a Woman mu&s;t have no Vanity in her, nay, no Corrupti|on in her, that is not overcome by it; and my Ca&s;e $as &s;uch, that, as before, I had enough of both.</P>
<P>I had now no Poverty attending me; on the contra|ry, I was Mi&s;tre&s;s of ten thou&s;and Pounds before the $rince did any Thing for me; had I been Mi&s;tre&s;s of $y Re&s;olution; had I been le&s;s obliging, and rejected $e fir&s;t Attack, all had been &s;afe; but my Virtue was $$&s;t before, and the Devil, who had found the Way to $eak in upon me by one Temptation, ea&s;ily ma&s;tered $e now by another; and I gave my&s;elf up to a Per&s;on, tho, tho' a Man of high Dignity, was yet the mo&s;t $mpting and obliging that ever I met with in my Life.</P>
<P>I had the &s;ame Particular to in&s;i&s;t upon here with the $rince, that I had with my Gentleman before; I he&s;i|$$ted much at con&s;enting, at fir&s;t asking; but the Prince $ld me, Princes did not court like other Men; that $$ey brought more powerful Arguments, and he very $ettily added that they were &s;ooner repul&s;ed than other $en, and ought to be &s;ooner complyed with; intimat|ing, tho' very genteely, that after a Woman had po&s;i|$ely refu&s;ed him once, he could not, like other Men, $ait with Importunities and Stratagems, and laying $ng Sieges; but as &s;uch Men as he &s;tormed warmly, &s;o, $ repul&s;ed, they made no &s;econd Attacks; and indeed, was but rea&s;onable; for as it was below their Rank $ be long battering a Woman's Con&s;tancy, &s;o they ran eater Hazards in being expo&s;ed in their Amours, than her Men did.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="70">
I took this for a &s;atisfactory An&s;wer, and told to Highne&s;s, that I had the &s;ame Thoughts, in Re&s;pect to the Manner of his Attacks, for that his Per&s;on and his Arguments were irre&s;i&s;tible; that a Per&s;on of his Rank, and a Munificence &s;o unbounded, could not be with|&s;tood; that no Virtue was Proof again&s;t him, except &s;uch as was able too to &s;uffer Martyrdom; that I thought it impo&s;&s;ible I could be overcome, but that now I found it was impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould not be overcome; that it much Goodne&s;s, join'd with &s;o much Greatne&s;s, would have conquer'd a Saint; and that I confe&s;s'd he had the Victory over me, by a Merit infinitely &s;uperior to the Conque&s;t he had made.</P>
<P>He made me a mo&s;t obliging An&s;wer; told me A|bundance of fine Things, which &s;till flattered my Va|nity, till at la&s;t I began to have Pride enough to believe him, and fancy'd my&s;elf a fit Mi&s;tre&s;s for a Prince.</P>
<P>As I had thus given the Prince the la&s;t Favour, and he had all the Freedom with me that it was po&s;&s;ible for me to grant, &s;o he gave me Leave to u&s;e as much Free|dom with him another Way, and that was to have ever$ Thing of him I thought fit to command; and yet I did not ask of him with an Air of Avarice, as if I was greedily making a Penny of him; but I manag'd him with &s;uch Art, that he generally anticipated my De|mands; he only reque&s;ted of me that I would not thank of taking another Hou&s;e, as I had intimated to hi$ Highne&s;s that I had intended, not thinking it good e|nough to receive his Vi&s;its in; but he &s;aid my Ho$$ was the mo&s;t convenient that could po&s;&s;ibly be &s;ound a all <HI>Paris</HI> for an Amour, e&s;pecially for him; having a Way out into three Streets, and not overlook'd by any Neighbours, &s;o that he could pa&s;s and repa&s;s without Ob|&s;ervation; for one of the Back-ways opened into a nar|row dark Alley, which Alley was a Thorough-fate, $or Pa&s;&s;age out of one Street into another; and any Per&s;on that went in or out by the Door had no more to do but to &s;ee that there was nobody following him in the Alley, before he went in at the Door: This Reque&s;t I know was rea&s;onable, and therefore I a&s;&s;ur'd him I would not

change my Dwelling, &s;eeing his Highne&s;s did not think it too mean for me to receive him in.</P>
<P>He al&s;o de&s;ired me that I would not take any more Servants, or &s;et up any Equipage, at lea&s;t, for the pre|&s;ent; for that it would then be immediately concluded I had been left very rich, and then I &s;hould be thronged with the Impertinence of Admirers, who would be at|tracted by the Money as well as by the Beauty of a young Widow, and he &s;hould be frequently interrupted in his Vi&s;its; or that the World would conclude I was maintained by &s;omebody, and would be inde&s;atigable to find out the Per&s;on; &s;o that he &s;hould have Spies peep|ing at him, every Time he went out or in, which it would be impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;appoint; and that he &s;hould pre&s;ently have it talked over all the Toilets in <HI>Paris,</HI> that the Prince de&mdash;had got the Jeweller's Widow for a Mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>This was too ju&s;t to oppo&s;e; and I made no Scruple to tell his Highne&s;s, that &s;ince he had &s;toop'd &s;o low as to make me his own, he ought to have all the Satisfac|tion in the World, that I was all his own; that I would take all the Mea&s;ures he &s;hould plea&s;e to direct me, to avoid the impertinent Attacks of others; and that, if he thought fit, I would be wholly within Doors, and have it given out, that I was obliged to go to <HI>England</HI> to &s;ol|licite my Affairs there, after my Husband's Misfortune; and that I was not expected there again for at lea&s;t a Year or two: This he lik'd very well; only, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> that he would by no Means have me confin'd; that it would injure my Health; and that I &s;hould then take a Country-hou&s;e in &s;ome Village, a good Way off from the City, where it &s;hould not be known who I was; and that I &s;hould be there &s;ometimes to divert me.</P>
<P>I made no Scruple of the Confinement, and told his Highne&s;s no Place could be a Confinement, where I had &s;uch a Vi&s;itor; and &s;o I put off the Country-hou&s;e, which would have been to remove my&s;elf farther from him, and have le&s;s of his Company; &s;o I made the Hou&s;e be, as it were, &s;hut up; <HI>Amy</HI> indeed appeared; and when any of the Neighbours and Servants enquir'd, he an&s;wered in broken <HI>French,</HI> that I was gone to <HI>Eng|land,</HI>

to look after my Affairs; which pre&s;ently went current thro' the Streets about us: For, you are to note, that the People of <HI>Paris,</HI> e&s;pecially the Women, are the mo&s;t bu&s;y and impertinent Enquirers into the Conduct of their Neighbours, e&s;pecially that of a &s;ingle Woman, that are in the World; tho' there are no greater Intriguers in the Univer&s;e then them&s;elves; and perhaps that may be the Rea&s;on of it; for $Word$ an old, but a &s;ure Rule; that</P>

<P>Never Woman, in &s;uch a Station, liv'd a Fortnight in &s;o compleat a Fullne&s;s of human Delight; for to have the entire Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one of the mo&s;t accompli&s;h'd Princes in the World, and of the polite&s;t, be&s;t bred Man; to conver&s;e with him all Day, and, as he pro|fe&s;s'd, charm him all Night; what could be more in|expre&s;&s;ibly plea&s;ing, and e&s;pecially, to a Woman of a va&s;t deal of Pride, as I was?</P>
<P>To fini&s;h the Felicity of this Part, I mu&s;t not forget, that the Devil had play'd a new Game with me, and prevail'd with me to &s;atisfy my&s;elf with this Amour, as a lawful Thing; that a Prince of &s;uch Grandear, and Maje&s;ty; &s;o infinitely &s;uperior to me; and one who had made &s;uch an Introduction by an unparallel'd Boun|ty, I could not re&s;i&s;t; and therefore, that it was very lawful for me to do it, being at that Time perfectly

My Lord, &s;aid I, after &s;ome little Check, for I cou'd not &s;peak pre&s;ently, I be&s;eech you to believe me, they are not Tears of Sorrow, but Tears of Joy; it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to &s;ee my&s;elf &s;natch'd from the Mi&s;ery I was fallen into, and at once to be in the Arms of a Prince of &s;uch Goodne&s;s, &s;uch immen&s;e Bounty, and be treated in &s;uch a Manner; 'tis not po&s;&s;ible, my Lord, &s;aid I, to contain the Satisfaction of it; and it will break out in an Exce&s;s in &s;ome Mea&s;ure propor|tion'd to your immen&s;e Bounty, and to the Affection which your Highne&s;s treats me with, who am &s;o infi|nitely below you.</P>
<P>It wou'd look a little too much like a Romance here, to repeat all the kind Things he &s;aid to me, on that Occa&s;ion; but I can't omit one Pa&s;&s;age; as he &s;aw the Tears drop down my Cheek, he pulls out a fine Cam|brick Handkerchief, and was going to wipe the Tears off, but check'd his Hand, as if he was afraid to deface &s;omething; I &s;ay, he check'd his Hand, and to&s;s'd the

<P>He appear'd &s;urpriz'd, more than ever, and &s;wore, which was the fir&s;t Time that I had heard him &s;wear, from my fir&s;t knowing him, that he cou'd not have believed there was any &s;uch Skin, without Paint, in the World: <HI>Well, my Lord,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>your Highne&s;s &s;hall have a farther Demon&s;tration than this; as to that which you are pleas'd to accept for Beauty, that it is the meer Work of Nature;</HI> and with that I &s;tept to the Door, and rung a little Bell, for my Woman <HI>Amy,</HI> and bace her bring me a Cup-full of hot Water, which &s;he did; and when it was come, I de&s;ir'd his Highne&s;s to $Word$ if it was warm; which he did, and I immediately wa&s;h'd my Face all over with it, before him; this was, indeed, more than Satisfaction, that is to &s;ay, than believing, for it was an undeniable Demon&s;tration, and he ki$$'d my Cheeks and Brea&s;ts a thou&s;and Times, with Ex|pre&s;&s;ions of the greate&s;t Surprize imaginable.</P>
<P>Nor was I a very indifferent Figure as to Shape; tho' I had two-Children by my Gentleman, and fix by my true Husband, I &s;ay I was no de pi$able Shape; and my Prince (I mu&s;t be allowed the Vanity to call him &s;o) was taking his View of me as I walked from one End of the Room to the other; at la&s;t he leads me to the darke&s;t Part of the Room, and &s;tanding behind me bid me hold up my Head, when putting both his Hands round my Neck, as if he was &s;panning my Neck, to &s;ee how &s;mall it was, for it was long and &s;mall; he held my Neck &s;o long and &s;o hard in his Hand that I complained he hurt me a little; what he did it for, I knew not, nor had I the lea&s;t Su&s;picion

<P>I love, Child, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> to &s;ee every Thing &s;uitable; a fine Gown and Petticoat; a fine lac'd Head; a fine Face and Neck and no Necklace, would not have made the Object perfect: But why that Blu&s;h, my Dear, <HI>&s;ays the Prince?</HI> My Lord, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> all your Gifts call for Blu&s;hes; but above all, I blu&s;h to receive what I am &s;o ill a le to merit, and may become &s;o ill al&s;o.</P>

<P>I could not, in the Height of all this fine Doings, I &s;ay, I could not be without &s;ome ju&s;t Reflection, tho' Con&s;cience was, as I &s;aid, dumb as to any Di&s;turbance it gave me in my Wickedne&s;s; my Vanity was fed up to &s;uch a Height, that I had no Room to give Way to &s;uch Reflections.</P>

<P>I, that knew what this Carca&s;s of mine had been but a few Years before; how overwhelmed with Grief, drowned in Tears, frighted with the Pro&s;pect of Beg|gary, and &s;urrounded with Rags, and fatherle&s;s chil|dren, that was pawning and &s;elling the Rags that co|vered me, for a Dinner, and &s;at on the Ground de pair|ing of Help, and expecting to be &s;tarved, till my Chil|dren were &s;natch'd from me, to be kept by the Pari&s;h; I, that was after this, a Whore for Bread, and abandoning Con&s;cience and Virtue, lived with another Woman's Husband; I, that was depi&s;ed by all my Relations, and my Husbands too; I, that was left &s;o entirely de&s;olate, $$endle&s;s and helple&s;s, that I knew not how to get the lea&s;t Help to keep me from &s;tarving; that I &s;hould be care&s;s'd by a Prince, for the Honour of having the &s;can|dulous U&s;e of my pro&s;tituted Body, common before to his Inferiors, and perhaps would not have denied one of his Footmen but a little while before, if I could have got my Bread by it.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, I could not but reflect upon the Brutality and Blindne&s;s of Mankind; that becau&s;e Nature had given me a good Skin, and &s;ome agreeable Features, &s;hould &s;uffer that Beauty to be &s;uch a Bait to Appetite, as to do &s;uch fordid unaccountable Things, to obtain the Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of it.</P>

<P>O! could we hear now the Reproaches this great Man afterwards loaded him&s;elf with, when he grew weary of this admir'd Creature, and became &s;ick of his Vice! how profitable would the Report of them be to the Reader of this Story; but had he him&s;elf al&s;o known the dirty Hi&s;tory of my Actings upon the Stage of Life, that little Time I had been in the World, how much more &s;evere would tho&s;e Reproaches have been upon him|&s;elf; but I &s;hall come to this again.</P>
<P>I lived in this gay Sort of Retirement almo&s;t three Years, in which Time, no Amour of &s;uch a kind, &s;ure, was ever carry'd up &s;o high; the Prince knew no Bounds to his Munificence; he could give me nothing, either for my wearing or u&s;ing, or eating or drinking, more than he had done from the Begininng.</P>
<P>His Pre&s;ents were, after that, in Gold, and very fre|quent and large; often an hundred Pa&s;toles, never le&s;s than fifty at a Time; and I mu&s;t do my&s;elf the Ju&s;tice, that I &s;eemed rather backward to receive, than craving and encroaching; not that I had not an avaricious Tem|per; nor was it that I did not fore&s;ee that this was my Harve&s;t, in which I was to gather up, and that it would not la&s;t long; but it was, that really his Bounty always anticipated my Expectations, and even my Wi&s;hes; and he gave me Money &s;o fa&s;t, that he rather poured it in upon me than left me Room to ask it; &s;o that before I could &s;pend fifty Pi&s;toles, I had always an hundred to make it up.</P>
<P>After I had been near a Year and half in his Arms, as above, or thereabouts, I proved with Child; I did not take any Notice of it to him, till I was &s;atisfy'd that I was not deceived; when one Morning early, when we were in Bed together, I &s;aid to him, my Lord, I doubt your Highne&s;s never gives your&s;elf Leave to think what the Ca&s;e &s;hould be, if I &s;hould have the Honour to be with Child by you: Why, my Dear, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> we are able to keep it if &s;uch a Thing &s;hould happen; I hope you are not concern'd about that: No, my Lord, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> I &s;hould think my&s;elf very happy, if I could bring

<P>He profe&s;s'd him&s;elf overjoyed at the Di&s;covery, but told me that now it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for me to quit the Confinement, which, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> I had &s;uffered for his Sake, and to take a Hou&s;e &s;omewhere in the Country, in Order for Health, as well as for Privacy, again&s;t my Lying-in: This was quite out of my Way; but the Prince, who was a Man of Plea&s;ure, had, it &s;eems, &s;everal Retreats of this Kind, which he had made U&s;e of, I &s;uppo&s;e, upon like Occa&s;ions; and &s;o leaving it, as it were, to his Gentleman, he provided a very convenient Hou&s;e, about four Miles South of <HI>Pa|ris,</HI> at the Village of&mdash;, where I had very a|greeable Lodgings, good Gardens, and all Things very ea&s;y to my Content; but one Thing did not plea&s;e me at all, <HI>viz.</HI> that an old Woman was provided, and put into the Hou&s;e to furni&s;h every Thing nece&s;&s;ary to my Lying-in, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t at my Travel.</P>
<P>I did not like this old Woman at all; &s;he look'd &s;o like a Spy upon me, or (as &s;ometimes I was frighted to imagine) like one &s;et privately to di&s;patch me out of the World, as might be&s;t &s;uit with the Circum&s;tance of my Lying-in; and when his Highne&s;s came the next Time to &s;ee me, which was not many Days, I expo&s;tu|ated a little on the Subject of the old Woman; and by the Management of my Tongue, as well as by the Strength of Rea&s;oning, I convinced him that it would not be at all convenient; that it would be the greater Ri&s;que on his Side; and that fir&s;t or la&s;t it would cer|tainly expo&s;e him, and me al&s;o; I a&s;&s;ured him that my

<P>This Di&s;cour&s;e fully &s;atisfy'd him, &s;o that he or|der'd his Gentleman to di&s;mi&s;s the old Woman $Word$ &s;ame Day; and without any Difficulty, I &s;ent my Maid <HI>Amy</HI> to <HI>Calais,</HI> and thence to <HI>Dover,</HI> where &s;he got an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Midwife, and an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nur&s;e, to come over on Purpo&s;e to attend an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Lady of Quality, as they &s;til'd me, for four Months certain: The Mid|wi&s;e, <HI>Amy</HI> had agreed to pay a hundred Guineas to, and bear her Charges to <HI>Paris,</HI> and back again to <HI>De|ver;</HI> the poor Woman that was to be my Nur&s;e, had twenty Pounds, and the &s;ame Terms for Charges, as the other.</P>
<P>I was very ea&s;y when <HI>Amy</HI> return'd, and the more, becau&s;e &s;he brought with the Midwi&s;e, a good Mother|ly Sort of Woman, who was to be her A&s;&s;i&s;tant, and would be very helpful on Occa&s;ion; and be&s;poke a Man midwi&s;e at <HI>Paris</HI> too, if there &s;hould be any Ne|ce&s;&s;ity for his Help: Having thus made Provi&s;ion for every Thing, the <HI>Count,</HI> for &s;o we all call'd him in pub|lic, came as often to &s;ee me as I could expect, and continued exceeding kind, as he had always been. One Day, conver&s;ing together, upon the Subject of my be|ing with Child, I told him how all Things were in or|der; but that I had a &s;trange Apprehen&s;ion that I &s;hould die with that Child: He &s;mil'd, <HI>So all the Ladies &s;ay,</HI> my Dear, &s;ays he, <HI>when they are with Child.</HI> Well, however, my Lord, &s;aid I, it is but ju&s;t, that Care &s;hou'd be taken, that what you have be&s;tow'd in your Exce&s;s of Bounty upon me, &s;hould not be lo&s;t; and

upon this, I pull'd a Paper out of my Bo&s;om, &s;olded up, but not &s;ealed, and read it to him: Wherein I had left Order, that all the Plate and Jewels, and fine Fur|niture, which his Highne&s;s had given me, &s;hould be re&s;tor'd to him by my Woman, and the Keys be im|mediately deliver'd to his Gentleman, in Ca&s;e of Di&s;a&s;ter.</P>
<P>Then I recommended my Woman <HI>Amy</HI> to his Fa|vour for a hundred Pi&s;toles, on Condition &s;he gave the Keys up, as above, to his Gentleman, and his Gentleman's Receipt for them; when he &s;aw this, <HI>My dear Child,</HI> &s;aid he, and took me in his Arms, <HI>What, have you been making your Will, and di&s;po&s;ing your Ef|fects?

<P>I cou'd &s;ee he took this very well: <HI>I have for&s;aken all the Ladies in</HI> Paris, &s;ays he, <HI>for you; and I have liv'd every Day &s;ince I knew you, to &s;ee that you know how to merit all that a Man of Honour can do for you; be ea&s;y, Child, I hope you &s;hall not die, and all you have is your own, to do what with it you plea&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>I was then within about two Months of my Time, and that &s;oon wore off; when I found my Time was come, it fell out very happily, that he was in the Hou&s;e, and I entreated he would continue a few Hours in the Hou&s;e, which he agreed to; they call'd his Highne&s;s to come into the Room, if he pleas'd, as I had offer'd, and as I de&s;ir'd him, and I &s;ent Word, I would make as few Cries as po&s;&s;ible, to prevent di&s;turb|ing him; he came into the Room once, and call'd to me to be of good Courage, it wou'd &s;oon be over, and then he withdrew again; and in about half an

Hour more, <HI>Amy</HI> carried him the News, that I was deliver'd, and had brought him a charming Boy; he gave her ten Pi&s;toles for her News, &s;tay'd till they had adju&s;ted Things about me, and then came into the Room again, chear'd me and &s;poke kindly to me, and look'd on the Child, then withdrew, and came again the next Day, to vi&s;it me.</P>
<P>Since this, and when I have look'd back upon the&s;e Things with Eyes unpo&s;&s;e&s;s'd with Crime, when the wicked Part has appeared in its clearer Light, and I have &s;een it in its own Colours; when no more blinded with the glittering Appearances, which at that Time deluded me, and, as in like Ca&s;es, if I may gue&s;s at others by my&s;elf, too much po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the Mind; I &s;ay, &s;ince this, I have often wonder'd, with what Plea&s;ure, or Satisfaction, the Prince cou'd look upon the poor innocent Infant; which tho' his own, and that he might that Way have &s;ome Attachment in his Affec|tions to it, yet mu&s;t always afterwards be a Remem|brancer to him of his mo&s;t early Crime; and which was wor&s;e, mu&s;t bear upon it&s;elf, unmerited, an eter|nal Mark of Infamy, which &s;hould be &s;poken of, upon all Occa&s;ions, to its Reproach, from the Folly of its Father, and Wickedne&s;s of its Mother.</P>
<P>Great Men are, indeed, deliver'd from the Burthen of their Natural Children, or Ba&s;tards, as to their Maintenance: This is the main Affliction in other Ca|&s;es, where there is not Sub&s;tance &s;ufficient, without breaking into the Fortunes of the Family; in tho&s;e Ca&s;es, either a Man's legitimate Children &s;uffer, which is very unnatural; or the unfortunate Mother of that illegitimate Birth, has a dreadful Affliction, either of being turn'd off with her Child, and be left to &s;tarve, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or of &s;eeing the poor Infant pack'd off with a Piece of Money, to &s;ome of tho&s;e She-butchers, who take Children off of their Hands, as 'tis call'd; that is to &s;ay, &s;tarve them, and, in a Word, murder them.</P>
<P>Great Men, I &s;ay, are deliver'd from this Burthen, becau&s;e they are always furni&s;h'd to &s;upply the Expence of their out-of-the-Way Off-&s;pring, by making little

A&s;&s;ignments upon the Bank of <HI>Lyons,</HI> or the Town-Hou&s;e of <HI>Paris,</HI> and &s;ettling tho&s;e Sums, to be receiv'd for the Maintenance of &s;uch Expence as they &s;ee Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus, in the Ca&s;e of this Child of mine, while he and I convers'd, there was no need to make any Ap|pointment, as an Appenage, or Maintenance for the Child, or its Nur&s;e; for he &s;upplied me more than &s;uf|ficiently for all tho&s;e Things; but afterward, when Time, and a particular Circum&s;tance, put an End to our con|ver&s;ing together; as $uch Things always meet with a Period, and generally break off abruptly; I &s;ay, after that, I found he appointed the Children a &s;ettled Al|lowance, by an A&s;&s;ignment of annual Rent, upon the Bank of <HI>Lyons,</HI> which was &s;ufficient for bringing them hand&s;omely, tho' privately, up in the World; and that not in a Manner unworthy of their Father's Blood, tho' I came to be &s;unk and forgotten in the Ca&s;e: nor did the Children ever know any thing of their Mother, to this Day, other than as you may have an Account hereafter.</P>
<P>But to look back to the particular Ob&s;ervation I was making, which I hope may be of U&s;e to tho&s;e who read my Story; I &s;ay, it was &s;omething wonderful to me, to &s;ee this Per&s;on &s;o exceedingly delighted at the Birth of this Child, and &s;o pleas'd with it; for he would &s;it and look at it, and with an Air of Seriou&s;ne&s;s &s;ometimes, a great while together; and particularly, I ob&s;erv'd, he lov'd to look at it when it was a &s;leep.</P>
<P>It was, indeed, a lovely charming Child, and had a certain Vivacity in its Countenance, that is far from being common to all Children &s;o young; and he would often &s;ay to me, that he believed there was &s;omething $xtraordinary in the Child, and he did not doubt but $e would come to be a great Man.</P>
<P>I could never hear him &s;ay &s;o, but tho' &s;ecretly it $eas'd me, yet it &s;o clo&s;ely touch'd me another Way, $hat I could not refrain Sighing, and &s;ometimes Tears; $nd one Time, in particular, it &s;o affected me, that I $ould not conceal it from him; but when he &s;aw Tears $n down my Face, there was no concealing the Occa|$$on from him; he was too importunate to be deny'd, a Thing of that Moment; &s;o I frankly an&s;wer'd, it
<PB N="88" REF="86">
&s;en&s;ibly affects me, MY LORD, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> that whatever the Merit of this little Creature may be, he mu&s;t always have a Bend on his Arms; the Di&s;a&s;ter of his Birth will be always, not a Blot only to his Honour, but a Bar to his Fortunes in the World; our Affection will be ever his Affliction, and his Mother's Crime be the Son's Re|proach; the Blot can never be wip'd out by the mo&s;t glorious Actions; nay, if it lives to rai&s;e a Family, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> the Infamy mu&s;t de&s;cend even to its innocent Po|&s;terity.</P>
<P>He took the Thought, and &s;ometimes told me after|wards, that it made a deeper Impre&s;&s;ion on him, than he di&s;cover'd to me at that Time; but for the pre&s;ent, he put it off, with telling me, the&s;e Things could not be help'd; that they &s;erv'd for a Spur to the Spirits of brave Men; in&s;pir'd them with the Principles of Gal|lantry, and prompted them to brave Actions; that tho' it might be true, that the Mention of Illegitimacy might attend the Name, yet that per&s;onal Virtue plac'd a Man of Honour above the Reproach of his Birth; that as he had no Share in the Offence, he would have no Concern at the Blot; when having by his own Merit plac'd him&s;elf out of the reach of Scandal, his Fame &s;hou'd drown the Memory of his Beginning.</P>
<P>That as it was u&s;ual for Men of Quality to make &s;uch little E&s;capes, &s;o the Number of their natural Chil|dren were &s;o great, and they generally took &s;uch good Care of their Education, that &s;ome of the greate&s;t Men in the World had a Bend in their Coats of Arms, and that it was of no Con&s;equence to them, e&s;pecially when their Fame began to ri&s;e upon the Ba&s;is of their acquir'd Merit; and upon this, he began to reckon up to me &s;ome of the greate&s;t Families in <HI>France,</HI> and in <HI>England</HI> al&s;o.</P>
<P>This carry'd off our Di&s;cour&s;e for a Time; but I went farther with him once, removing the Di&s;cour&s;e from the Part attending our Children, to the Reproach which tho&s;e Children would be apt to throw upon us, their Originals; and when &s;peaking a little too feeling|ly on the Subject, he began to receive the Impre&s;&s;ion a little deeper than I wi&s;h'd he had done; at la&s;t he

told me, I had almo&s;t acted the Confe&s;&s;or to him; that I might, perhaps, preach a more dangerous Doctrine to him than we &s;hou'd either of us like, or than I was aw$re of; for, <HI>my Dear, &s;ays he,</HI> if once we come to talk of Repentance, we mu&s;t talk of parting.</P>
<P>If Tears were in my Eyes before, they flow'd too fa&s;t now to be retrain'd, and I gave him but too much Satisfaction by my Looks, that I had yet no Reflections upon my Mind, &s;trong enough to go that Length, and that I could no more think of parting, than he could.</P>
<P>He &s;aid a great many kind Things, which were Great, like him&s;elf, and extenuating our Crime, in|timated to me, that he cou'd no more part with me, than I cou'd with him; &s;o we both, as I may &s;ay, even again&s;t our Light, and again&s;t our Conviction, concluded to SIN ON; indeed, his Affection to the Child was one great Tye to him, for he was extremely fond of it.</P>
<P>This Child liv'd to be a con&s;iderable Man. He was fir&s;t, an Officer of the Guard <HI>du Corps</HI> of <HI>France;</HI> and afterwards Colonel of a Regiment of Dragoons, in <HI>Italy;</HI> and on many extraordinary Occa&s;ions, &s;hew'd that he was not unworthy &s;uch a Father, but many Ways de|&s;erving a legitimate Birth, and a better Mother: Of which hereafter.</P>
<P>I think I may &s;ay now, that I liv'd indeed like a Queen; or if you will have me confe&s;s, that my Con|dition had &s;till the Reproach of <HI>a Whore,</HI> I may &s;ay, I was &s;ure, the Queen of Whores; for no Woman was $ver more valued, or more care&s;s'd by a Per&s;on of &s;uch Quality, only in the Station of a Mi&s;tre&s;s; I had, indeed, $$e De&s;iciency, which Women in &s;uch Circum&s;tances $$$dom are chargeable with; namely. I crav'd nothing $$ him; I never ask'd him for any Thing in my Life; $or &s;uffer'd my&s;elf to be made u&s;e of, as is too much the Cu&s;tom of Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, to ask Favours for others; $$ Bounty always prevented me in the fir&s;t, and my $Word$ concealing my&s;elf, in the la&s;t; which was no le&s;s $$ my Convenience, than his.</P>
<P>The only Favour I ever ask'd of him, was, for his $entleman, whom he had all along intru&s;ted with the $$tiet of our Affair, and who had once &s;o much of|fended

him, by &s;ome Omi&s;&s;ions in his Duty, that he found it very hard to make his Peace; he came and laid his Ca&s;e before my Woman <HI>Amy,</HI> and begg'd her to &s;peak to me, to interceed for him; which I did, and on my Account, he was receiv'd again, and pardon'd; for which, the grateful Dog requited me, by getting to Bed to his Benefactre&s;s <HI>Amy;</HI> at which I was very angry; but <HI>Amy</HI> generou&s;ly acknowledg'd, that it was her Fault as much as his; that &s;he lov'd the Fellow &s;o much, that &s;he believ'd, if he had not ask'd her, &s;he &s;hould have ask'd him; I &s;ay, this pacify'd me, and I only obtain'd of her, that &s;he &s;hould not let him know that I knew it.</P>
<P>I might have inter&s;pers'd this Part of my Story with a great many plea&s;ant Parts, and Di&s;cour&s;es, which hap|pen'd between my Maid <HI>Amy,</HI> and I; but I omit them, on Account of my own Story, which has been &s;o ex|traordinary: However, I mu&s;t mention &s;omething as to <HI>Amy</HI> and her Gentleman.

<P>On that Account, indeed, as I &s;aid above, I could not find in my Heart to be angry with <HI>Amy;</HI> I was in|deed afraid the Girl would have been with Child $$, but that did not happen, and &s;o there was no Hurt done; for <HI>Amy</HI> had been han&s;ell'd before, as well as her Mi|&s;tre&s;s, and by the &s;ame Party too, as you have heard.</P>

After I was up again, and my Child provided with a good Nur&s;e, and withal, Winter coming on, it was proper to think of coming to <HI>Paris</HI> again, which I did; $ut as I had now a Coach and Hor&s;es, and &s;ome Ser|vants to attend me, by my Lord's Allowance, I took the Liberty to have them come to <HI>Paris</HI> &s;ometimes, and &s;o to take a Tour into the Garden of the <HI>Thuilleries,</HI> and the other plea&s;ant Places of the City. It happen'd one Day, that my Prince (if I may call him &s;o) had a Mind to give me &s;ome Diver&s;ion, and to take the Air with me; but that he might do it, and not be publickly known, he comes to me in a Coach of the Count <HI>de&mdash;,</HI> a great Officer of the Court, attended by his Liveries al&s;o; &s;o that, in a Word, it was impo&s;&s;ible to gue&s;s by the Equipage, who I was, or who I belong'd to; al&s;o, that I might be the more effectually conceal'd, he order'd me to be taken up at a Mantua-Maker's Hou&s;e, where he &s;ometimes came, whether upon other Amours, or not, was no Bu&s;ine&s;s of mine to enquire: I knew nothing whither he intended to carry me; but when he was in the Coach with me, he told me, he had order'd his Servants to go to court with me, and he would &s;hew me &s;ome of the <HI>Beau Monde;</HI> I told him, I $$'d not where I went, while I had the Honour to have him with me; &s;o he carried me to the fine Palace of <HI>Meudon,</HI> where the <HI>Dauphine</HI> then was, and where $$ had &s;ome particular Intimacy with one of the <HI>Dau|phine</HI>'s Dome&s;ticks, who procur'd a Retreat for me in his $$dgings, while we &s;tay'd there; which was three or four Days.</P>
<P>While I was there, the KING happen'd to come thi|ther from <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> and making but a &s;hort Stay, vi|$$ Madam the <HI>Dauphine&s;s,</HI> who was then living.

<P>I cou'd not be deceiv'd; I pa&s;s'd &s;o near him, that I almo&s;t bru&s;h'd him with my Cloaths, and look'd him full in the Face; but having my Fan before my Face, &s;o that he cou'd not know me; however, I knew him per|fectly well, and I heard him &s;peak, which was a &s;econd Way of knowing him; be&s;ides, <HI>being, you may be &s;ur$ a&s;toni&s;h'd and &s;urpriz'd at &s;uch a Sight,</HI> I turn'd about after I had pa&s;s'd him &s;ome Steps, and pretending to ask the Lady that was with me, &s;ome Que&s;tions, I &s;tood as if I had view'd the Great Hall, the outer Guard-Chamber, and &s;ome other Things: but I did it to take a full View of his Dre&s;s, that I might farther inform my&s;elf.</P>

<P>Two Days after this, we return'd for <HI>Paris,</HI> when I $ook Occa&s;ion to &s;peak to my Lord, that I heard the <HI>$$n. d'arms</HI> were to be in the City the next Week, and that I &s;hould be charm'd with &s;eeing them march, if they came in a Body: He was &s;o obliging in &s;uch Things, that I need but ju&s;t name a Thing of that Kind, and it was done; &s;o he order'd his Gentleman (I &s;hou'd now $all him <HI>Amy</HI>'s <HI>Gentleman)</HI> to get me a Place in a cer|tain Hou&s;e, where I might &s;ee them march.</P>

<P><HI>Amy</HI> then &s;eeing him &s;o perfectly deluded, made a $Word$ and lamentable Out-cry, how &s;he had been delud|$d away, to marry a poor Footman; for he is no wor&s;e, $Word$ better, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> tho' he calls him&s;elf a Lord's Gentle|m$n; and here, <HI>&s;ays</HI> Amy, he has dragg'd me over in|$o a &s;trange Country, to make a Beggar of me; and $hen &s;he falls a howling again, and &s;niveling; which, $y the Way, was all Hypocri&s;y, but acted &s;o to the $ife, as perfectly deceived him, and he gave entire Cre|$$t to every Word of it.</P>

<P>Upon the whole of the Di&s;cour&s;e, <HI>Amy</HI> got out of him what Condition he was in, and how he liv'd, upon her Pro|mi&s;e to him, that if ever &s;he came to <HI>England,</HI> and &s;hou'd &s;ee her Mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;he &s;hould not let her know that he was a|live: Alas!

on my Account; well, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> my poor Mi&s;tre&s;s has had the Lo&s;s, tho' &s;he knows nothing of it; O dear! how happy it would have been; to be &s;ure, Sir, you would have help'd her all you could; <HI>Ay,</HI> &s;ays he, Amy, <HI>&s;o I would with all my Heart; and even as I am, I would &s;end her &s;ome Relief, if I thought &s;he wanted it; only, that then letting her know I was alive, might do her &s;ome Prejudice, in Ca&s;e of her &s;ettling, or marrying any Body.</HI></P>
<P>Alas! <HI>&s;ays</HI> Amy, marry! who will marry her in the poor Condition &s;he is in? And &s;o their Di&s;cour&s;e ended for that Time.</P>
<P>All this was meer Talk on both Sides, and Words of Cour&s;e; for on farther Enquiry, <HI>Amy</HI> found that he had no &s;uch Offer of a Lieutenant's Commi&s;&s;ion, or a|ny Thing like it; and that he rambled in his Di&s;cour&s;e from one Thing to another: But of that in its Place.</P>
<P>You may be &s;ure, that this Di&s;cour&s;e, as <HI>Amy</HI> at fir&s;t related it, was moving, to the la&s;t Degree, upon me; and I was once going to have &s;ent him the 8000 Livres, to purcha&s;e the Commi&s;&s;ion he had &s;poken of; but as I knew his Character better than any Body, I was wil|ling to &s;earch a little farther into it; and &s;o I &s;et <HI>Amy</HI> to enquire of &s;ome other of the Troop, to &s;ee what Character he had, and whether there was any Thing in the Story of a Lieutenant's Commi&s;&s;ion, or no.</P>
<P>But <HI>Amy</HI> &s;oon came into a better Under&s;tanding of him; for &s;he pre&s;ently learnt that he had a mo&s;t &s;coun|drel Character, that there was nothing of Weight in any Thing he &s;aid; but that he was, in &s;hort, a meer Sharper; one that would &s;tick at nothing to get Mo|ney, and there was no depending on any Thing he &s;aid; and that, more e&s;pecially, about the Lieutenant's Commi&s;&s;ion, &s;he under&s;tood, that there was nothing at all in it; but they told her, how he had often made u&s;e of <HI>that Sham,</HI> to borrow Money, and move Gen|tlemen to pity him, and lend him Money, in Hopes to get him Preferment; that he had reported, that he had a Wife and five Children in <HI>England,</HI> whom he main|tain'd out of his Pay; and by the&s;e Shifts had run in|to
<PB N="100" REF="98">
Debt in &s;everal Places; and upon &s;everal Complaints for &s;uch Things, he had been threatned to be turn'd out of the <HI>Gensd'arms;</HI> and that, in &s;hort, he was not to be believ'd in any Thing he &s;aid, or tru&s;ted on any Account.</P>
<P>Upon this Information, <HI>Amy</HI> began to cool in her farther meddling with him; and told me, it was not &s;afe for me to attempt doing him any Good, unle&s;s I re&s;olved to put him upon Su&s;picions and Enquiries, which might be to my Ruin, in the Condition I was now in.</P>
<P>I was &s;oon confirmed in this Part of his Character; for the next Time that <HI>Amy</HI> came to talk with him, he di&s;cover'd him&s;elf more effectually; for while &s;he had put him in Hopes of procuring One to advance the Money for the Lieutenant's Commi&s;&s;ion for him, upon ea&s;y Conditions, he by Degrees, dropt the Di&s;cour&s;e, then pretended it was too late, and that he could not get it; and then de&s;cended to a&s;k poor <HI>Amy</HI> to lend him 500 Pi&s;toles.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> pretended Poverty; that her Circum&s;tances were but mean; and that &s;he cou'd not rai&s;e &s;uch a Sum; and this &s;he did, to try him to the utmo&s;t; he de&s;cended to 300, then to 100, then to 50, and then to a Pi&s;tole, which &s;he lent him, and he never inten|ding to pay it, play'd out of her Sight, as much as he cou'd. Being &s;atisfied that he was the &s;ame worthle&s;s Thing he had ever been, I threw off all Thoughts of him; whereas, had he been a Man of any Sen&s;e, and of any Principle of Honour, I had it in my Thoughts to retire to <HI>England</HI> again, &s;end for him over, and have liv'd hone&s;tly with him: But as a Fool is the wor&s;t of Husbands to do a Woman Good, &s;o a Fool is the wor&s;t Husband a Woman can do Good to: I wou'd willingly have done him Good, but he was not quali|fied to receive it, or make the be&s;t U&s;e of it: had I &s;ent him ten thou&s;and Crowns, in&s;tead of eight thou|&s;and Livres, and &s;ent it with expre&s;s Condition, that he &s;hould immediately have bought him&s;elf the Com|mi&s;&s;ion he talk'd of, with Part of the Money, and
<PB N="101" REF="99">
have &s;ent &s;ome of it to relieve the Nece&s;&s;ities of his poor mi&s;erable Wife at <HI>London,</HI> and to prevent his Children to be kept by the Pari&s;h, it was evident, he wou'd have been &s;till but a private Trooper, and his Wife and Children &s;hould &s;till have &s;tarv'd at <HI>London,</HI> or been kept of meer Charity, as, for ought he knew, they then were.</P>
<P>Seeing therefore, no Remedy, I was oblig'd to with|draw my Hand from him, that had been my fir&s;t De|&s;troyer, and re&s;erve the A&s;&s;i&s;tance that I intended to have given him, for another more de&s;irable Opportunity; all that I had now to do, was to keep my&s;elf out of his Sight, which was not very difficult for me to do, con&s;idering in what Station he liv'd.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> and I had &s;everal Con&s;ultations then, upon the main Que&s;tion, namely, how to be &s;ure never to chop upon him again, by Chance, and &s;o be &s;urpriz'd into a Di&s;covery; which would have been a fatal Di&s;covery indeed: <HI>Amy</HI> propos'd, that we &s;hould always take Care to know where the <HI>Gens d'arms</HI> were quarter'd, and thereby effectually avoid them; and this was one Way.</P>
<P>But this was not &s;o as to be fully to my Satisfaction; no ordinary Way of enquiring where the <HI>Gensd'arms</HI> were quarter'd, was &s;ufficient to me; but I found out a Fellow, who was compleatly qualified for the Work of a Spy, (for <HI>France</HI> has Plenty of &s;uch People,) this Man I employ'd to be a con&s;tant and particular Atten|dant upon his Per&s;on and Motions; and he was e&s;peci|ally employ'd, and order'd to haunt him as a Gho&s;t; that he &s;hould &s;carce let him be ever out of his Sight; he perform'd this to a Nicety, and fail'd not to give me a perfect Journal of all his Motions, from Day to Day; and whether for his Plea&s;ures, or his Bu&s;ine&s;s, was al|ways at his Heels.</P>
<P>This was &s;omewhat expen&s;ive, and &s;uch a Fellow merited to be well paid; but he did his Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o ex|qui&s;itely punctual, that this poor Man &s;carce went out of the Hou&s;e, without my knowing the Way he went,
<PB N="102" REF="100">
the Company he kept, when he went Abroad, and when he &s;tay'd at Home.</P>
<P>By this extraordinary Conduct I made my&s;elf &s;afe, and &s;o went out in Publick, or &s;tay'd at Home, as I found he was, or was not, in a Po&s;&s;iblity of being at <HI>Paris,</HI> at <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> or any Place I had Occa&s;ion to be at. This though it was very chargeable, yet as I found it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, &s;o I took no Thought about the Expence of it; for I knew I cou'd not purcha&s;e my Safety too dear.</P>
<P>By this Management I found an Opportunity to &s;ee what a mo&s;t in&s;ignificant, unthinking Life the poor indolent Wretch, who by his unactive Temper had at fir&s;t been my Ruin, now liv'd; how he only ro&s;e in the Morning, to go to-Bed at Night; that &s;aving the ne|ce&s;&s;ary Motion of the Troops, which he was oblig'd to attend, he was a meer motionle&s;s Animal, of no Con|&s;equence in the World; that he &s;eem'd to be one, who, tho' he was indeed alive, had no manner of Bu|&s;ine&s;s in Life, but to &s;tay to be call'd out of it; he nei|ther kept any Company, minded any Sport, play'd at any Game, or indeed, did any Thing of Moment; but, in &s;hort, &s;aunter'd about, like one, that it was not two Livres Value whether he was dead or alive; that when he was gone, would leave no Remembrance behind him that ever he was here; that if ever he did any Thing in the World to be talk'd of, it was, only to get five Beggars, and &s;tarve his Wife: the Journal of his Life, which I had con&s;tantly &s;ent me every Week, was the lea&s;t &s;ignificant of any Thing of its Kind, that was ever &s;een; as it had really nothing of Earne&s;t in it, &s;o it wou'd make no Je&s;t, to relate it; it was not important enough, &s;o much as to make the Reader merry withal; and for that Rea&s;on I omit it.</P>
<P>Yet this Nothing-doing Wretch was I oblig'd to watch and guard again&s;t, as again&s;t the only Thing that was capable of doing me Hurt in the World. I was to &s;hun him, as we would &s;hun a Spectre, or even the Devil, if he was actually in our Way; and it co&s;t me after the Rate of a 150 Livres a Month, and very
<PB N="103" REF="101">
cheap too, to have this Creature con&s;tantly kept in View; that is to &s;ay, my Spy undertook never to let him be out of his Sight an Hour, but &s;o as that he cou'd give an Account of him; which was much the ea&s;ier to be done, con&s;idering his Way of Living; for he was &s;ure, that for whole Weeks together, he wou'd be ten Hours of the Day half a&s;leep on a Bench at the Tavern Door where he quarter'd, or drunk within the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Tho' this wicked Life he led, &s;ometimes mov'd me to pity him, and to wonder how &s;o well bred gentle|manly a Man as he once was, could degenerate into &s;uch an u&s;ele&s;s Thing as he now appear'd; yet, at the &s;ame Time, it gave me mo&s;t contemptible Thoughts of him, and made me often &s;ay, I was a Warning for all the Ladies of <HI>Europe,</HI> again&s;t marrying of Fools; a Man of Sen&s;e falls in the World, and gets up again, and a Woman has &s;ome Chance for her&s;elf; but with a Fool! once fall, and ever undone; once in the Ditch, and die in the Ditch; once poor, and &s;ure to &s;tarve.</P>
<P>But 'tis Time to have done with him; once I had nothing to hope for, but to &s;ee him again; now my only Felicity was, if po&s;&s;ible, never to &s;ee him, and, above all, to keep him from &s;eeing me; which, as a|bove, I took effectual Care of.</P>
<P>I was now return'd to <HI>Paris;</HI> my little <HI>Son of Honour,</HI> as I call'd him, was left at&mdash;, where my la&s;t Coun|try Seat then was, and I came to <HI>Paris,</HI> at the Prince's Reque&s;t; thither he came to me as &s;oon as I arriv'd, and told me, he came to give me Joy of my Return, and to make his Acknowledgments, for that I had given him a Son: I thought indeed, he had been go|ing to give me a Pre&s;ent, and &s;o he did the next Day, but in what he &s;aid then, he je&s;ted with me: He gave me his Company all the Evening; Supp'd with me a|bout Midnight, and did me the Honour, as I then call'd it, to lodge me in his Arms all the Night, tel|$ing me, in je&s;t, that the be&s;t Thanks for a Son born, was giving the Pledge for another.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="102">
But as I hinted, &s;o it was, the next Morning he laid me down, on my Toilet, a Pur&s;e with 300 Pi&s;toles: I &s;aw him lay it down, and under&s;tood what he meant, but I took no Notice of it, till I came to it (as it were) ca&s;ually; then I gave a great Cry-out, and fell a &s;cold|ing in my Way, for he gave me all po&s;&s;ible Freedom of Speech on &s;uch Occa&s;ions: I told him, he was un|kind; that he would never give me an Opportunity to ask him for any Thing; and that he forc'd me to blu&s;h, by being too much oblig'd, and the like; all which I knew was very agreeable to him; for as he was boun|tiful beyond Mea&s;ure, &s;o he was infinitely oblig'd by my being &s;o backward to ask any Favours; and I was even with him, for I never ask'd him for a Far|thing in my Life.</P>
<P>Upon this rallying him, he told me, I had either perfectly &s;tudied the Art of Humour, or el&s;e, what was the greate&s;t Difficulty to others, was natural to me; adding, That nothing cou'd be more obliging to a Man of Honour, than not to be &s;olliciting and craving.</P>
<P>I told him, nothing cou'd be craving upon him; that he left no Room for it; that I hop'd he did not give, meerly to avoid the Trouble of being impor|tun'd; I told him, he might depend upon it, that I &s;hould be reduced very low indeed, before I offer'd to di&s;turb him that Way.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, a Man of Honour ought always to know what he ought to do; and as he did nothing but what he knew was rea&s;onable, he gave me Leave to be free with him, if I wanted any Thing; that he had too much Value for me, to deny me any Thing, if I ask'd; but that it was infinitely agreeable to him to hear me &s;ay, that what he did, was to my Satisfaction.</P>
<P>We &s;train'd Compliments thus a great while, and as he had me in his Arms mo&s;t Part of the Time, &s;o upon all my Expre&s;&s;ions of his Bounty to me, he put a Stop to me with his Ki&s;&s;es, and wou'd admit me to go on no farther.</P>
<P>I &s;hould in this Place mention, that this Prince was not a Subject of <HI>France,</HI> tho' at that Time he re&s;ided at
<PB N="105" REF="103">
<HI>Paris,</HI> and was much at Court, where, I &s;uppo&s;e, he had or expected &s;ome con&s;iderable Employment: But I mention it on this Account; that a few Days after this, he came to me, and told me, he was come to bring me not the mo&s;t welcome News that ever I heard from him in his Life; I look'd at him, a little &s;ur|priz'd; but he return'd, Do not be unea&s;y, it is as un|plea&s;ant to me, as to you, but I come to con&s;ult with you about it, and &s;ee if it cannot be made a little ea&s;y to us both.</P>
<P>I &s;eem'd &s;till more concern'd, and &s;urpriz'd; at la&s;t he &s;aid, it was, that he believ'd he &s;hould be oblig'd to go into <HI>Italy,</HI> which tho' otherwi&s;e it was very agree|able to him, yet his parting with me, made it a very dull Thing but to think of.</P>
<P>I &s;at mute, as one Thunder-&s;truck, for a good while; and it pre&s;ently occur'd to me, that I was going to lo&s;e him, which, indeed, I cou'd but ill bear the Thoughts of; and as he told me, I turn'd pale: What's the Mat|ter? &s;aid he, ha&s;tily; I have &s;urpriz'd you indeed; and &s;tepping to the Side-board, fills a Dram of Cordial-Water, (which was of his own bringing) and comes to me, Be not &s;urpriz'd, &s;aid he, I'll go no-where without you; adding &s;everal other Things &s;o kind, as nothing could exceed it.</P>
<P>I might, indeed, turn pale, for I was very much &s;urpriz'd at fir&s;t, believing that this was, as it often happens in &s;uch Ca&s;es, only a Project to drop me, and break off an Amour, which he had now carried on &s;o long; and a thou&s;and Thoughts whirl'd about my Head in the few Moments while I was kept in &s;u&s;|pence; (for they were but a few) I &s;ay, I was indeed &s;urpriz'd, and might, perhaps, look pale; but I was not in any Danger of fainting, that I knew of.</P>
<P>However, it not a little plea&s;ed me, to &s;ee him &s;o concerned and anxious about me; but I &s;topped a little, when he put the Cordial to my Mouth, and taking the Gla&s;s in my Hand, <HI>I &s;aid,</HI> my Lord, your Words are $nfinitely more of a Cordial to me than this Citron; for $s nothing can be a greater Affliction than to lo&s;e you,
<PB N="106" REF="104">
&s;o nothing can be a greater Satisfaction than the A&s;|&s;urance, that I &s;hall not have that Misfortune.</P>
<P>He made me &s;it down, and &s;at down by me, and after &s;aying a thou&s;and kind Things to me; he turns upon me, with a Smile, why, will you venture your&s;elf to <HI>Italy</HI> with me? <HI>&s;ays he;</HI> I &s;topy'd a-while, and then an&s;wer'd, that I wonder'd he would ask me that Que&s;|tion; for I would go any where in the World, or all over the World, wherever he &s;hou'd de&s;ire me, and give me the Felicity of his Company.</P>
<P>Then he enter'd into a long Account of the Occa&s;ion of his Journey, and how the King had engag'd him to go, and &s;ome other Circum&s;tances, which are not proper to enter into here; it being by no means proper to &s;ay any thing, that might lead the Reader into the lea&s;t Gue&s;s at the Per&s;on.</P>
<P>But to cut &s;hort this Part of the Story, and the Hi&s;|tory of our Journey, and Stay abroad, which would almo&s;t &s;ill up a Volume of it&s;elf, I &s;ay, we &s;pent all that Evening in chearful Con&s;ultations about the Man|ner of our Travelling; the Equipage and Figure he &s;hou'd go in; and in what Manner I &s;hou'd go: Seve|ral Ways were propos'd, but none &s;eem'd fea&s;ible; till, at la&s;t, I told him, I thought it would be &s;o trouble|&s;ome, &s;o expen&s;ive, and &s;o publick, that it wou'd he many Ways inconvenient to him; and tho' it was a kind of Death to me to lo&s;e him, yet that rather than &s;o very much perplex his Affairs, I wou'd &s;ubmit to any Thing.</P>
<P>At the next Vi&s;it I fill'd his Head with the &s;ame Difficulties, and then, at la&s;t, came over him with a Propo&s;al, that I wou'd &s;tay in <HI>Paris,</HI> or where el&s;e he &s;hou'd direct; and when I heard of his &s;afe Arrival, wou'd come away by my&s;elf, and place my&s;elf as near him as I cou'd.</P>
<P>This gave him no Satisfaction at all; nor wou'd he hear any more of it; but if I dur&s;t venture my&s;elf as he call'd it, &s;uch a Journey, he wou'd not lo&s;e the Satis|faction of my Company; and as for the Expence, tha$ was not to be nam'd, neither indeed was there room to name it; for I &s;ound, that he travell'd at the KING'S
<PB N="107" REF="105">
Expence, as well for him&s;elf, as for all his Equipage; being upon a Piece of &s;ecret Service of the la&s;t Im|portance.</P>
<P>But after &s;everal Debates between our&s;elves, he came to this Re&s;olution, <HI>viz.</HI> that he would travel <HI>Incognito,</HI> and &s;o he &s;hou'd avoid all publick Notice, either of him|&s;elf, or who went with him; and that then he &s;hou'd not only carry me with him, but have a perfect Lei&s;ure of enjoying my agreeable Company, <HI>(as he was pleas'd to call it)</HI> all the Way.</P>
<P>This was &s;o obliging, that nothing cou'd be more; &s;o upon this Foot, he immediately &s;et to Work to pre|pare Things for his Journey; and by his Directions, &s;o did I too: But now I had a terrible Difficulty upon me, and which Way to get over it, I knew not; and that was, in what Manner to take Care of what I had to leave behind me; I was rich, as I have &s;aid, very rich, and what to do with it, I knew not, nor who to leave in Tru&s;t, I knew not; I had no-body but <HI>Amy</HI> in the World, and to travel without <HI>Amy,</HI> was very uncomfort|able; or to leave all I had in the World with her, and if &s;he mi&s;carried, be ruin'd at once, was &s;till a frightful Thought; for <HI>Amy</HI> might die, and who&s;e Hands Things might fall into, I knew not: This gave me great Un|ea&s;ine&s;s, and I knew not what to do; for I could not mention it to the Prince, le&s;t he &s;hould &s;ee that I was richer than he thought I was.</P>
<P>But the Prince made all this ea&s;y to me; for in con|certing Mea&s;ures for our Journey, he &s;tarted the Thing him&s;elf, and ask'd me merrily one Evening, who I wou'd tru&s;t with all my Wealth, in my Ab&s;ence?</P>
<P>My Wealth, my Lord, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> except what I owe to your Goodne&s;s, is but &s;mall; but yet, that little I have, I confe&s;s, cau&s;es &s;ome Thoughtfulne&s;s; becau&s;e I have no Acquaintance in <HI>Paris,</HI> that I dare tru&s;t with it, nor any-body but my Woman, to leave in the Hou&s;e; and how to do without her upon the Road, I do not well know.</P>
<P>As to the Road, be not concern'd, <HI>&s;ays the Prince,</HI> I'll provide you Servants to your Mind; and as for your Woman, if you can tru&s;t her, leave her here, and I'll
<PB N="108" REF="106">
put you in a Way how to &s;ecure Things, as well as if you were at Home: I bow'd, and told him, I cou'd not be put into better Hands than his own, and that therefore, I wou'd govern all my Mea&s;ures by his Di|rections; &s;o we talk'd no more of it that Night.</P>
<P>The next Day he &s;ent me in a great Iron Che&s;t, &s;o large, that it was as much as &s;ix lu&s;ty Fellows could get up the Steps, into the Hou&s;e; and in this I put, indeed, all my Wealth; and for my Safety, he order'd a good hone&s;t ancient Man and his Wife to be in the Hou&s;e with her, to keep her Company, and a Maid-Servant, and Boy; &s;o that there was a good Family, and <HI>Amy</HI> was Madam, the Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Things being thus &s;ecur'd, we &s;et out <HI>Incog,</HI> as he call|ed it; but we had two Coaches and &s;ix Hor&s;es; two Chai|&s;es; and about eight Men-Servants on Hor&s;eback, all very well arm'd.</P>
<P>Never was Woman better us'd in this World, that went upon no other Account than I did; I had three Women-Servants to wait on me, one whereof was an old Madam&mdash;, who thoroughly under&s;tood her Bu&s;ine&s;s, and manag'd every Thing, as if &s;he had been <HI>Mayer Domo;</HI> &s;o I had no Trouble; they had one Coach to them&s;elves, and the Prince and I in the other; only that &s;ometimes, where he knew it nece&s;&s;ary, I went into their Coach; and one particular Gentleman of the Retinue rode with him.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;ay no more of the Journey, than that when we came to tho&s;e frightful Mountains the <HI>Alps,</HI> there was no travelling in our Coaches, &s;o he order'd a Hor&s;e-Litter, but carried by Mules, to be provided for me, and him&s;elf went on Hor&s;eback; the Coaches went &s;ome other Way back to <HI>Lyons;</HI> then we had Coaches hir'd at <HI>Turin,</HI> which met us at <HI>Su&s;a;</HI> &s;o that we were ac|commodated again, and went by ea&s;y Journeys after|wards to <HI>Rome,</HI> where his Bu&s;ine&s;s, <HI>whatever it was</HI> call'd him to &s;tay &s;ome Time; and from thence to <HI>Venite.</HI></P>
<P>He was as good as his Word indeed, for I had the Plea&s;ure of his Company, and in a Word, engro&s;s'd his Conver&s;ation almo&s;t all the Way: He took Delight in &s;howing me every Thing that was to be &s;een, and
<PB N="109" REF="107">
particularly, in telling me &s;omething of the Hi&s;tory of every Thing he &s;how'd me.</P>
<P>What valuable Pains were here thrown away upon one, whom he was &s;ure, at la&s;t, to abandon with Re|gret! How below him&s;elf, did a Man of Quality, and of a thou&s;and Accompli&s;hments, behave in all this! 'Tis one of my Rea&s;ons for entring into this Part, which otherwi&s;e wou'd not be worth relating: Had I been a Daughter, or a Wife, of whom it might be &s;aid, that he had a ju&s;t Concern in their In&s;truction or Improve|ment, it had been an admirable Step; but all this to a Whore! to one whom he carried with him upon no Ac|count, that could be rationally agrecable; and none but to gratify the meane&s;t of human Frailties: This was the Wonder of it.</P>
<P>But &s;uch is the Power of a vicious Inclination; Whor|ing was, in a Word, his darling Crime; the wor&s;t Excur&s;ion he made; for he was otherwi&s;e, one of the mo&s;t excellent Per&s;ons in the World; no Pa&s;&s;ions; no furious Excur&s;ions; no oftentatious Pride; the mo&s;t humble, courteous, affable Per&s;on in the World; not an Oath, not an indecent Word, or the lea&s;t Blemi&s;h in Behaviour, was to be &s;een in all his Conver&s;ation, ex|cept as before excepted; and it has given me Occa&s;ion for many dark Reflections &s;ince, to look back and think, that I &s;hould be the Snare of &s;uch a Per&s;on's Life; that I &s;hould influence him to &s;o much Wick|edne&s;s; and that I &s;hould be the In&s;trument in the Hand of the Devil, to do him &s;o much Prejudice.</P>
<P>We were near two Years upon this <HI>Grand Tour,</HI> as it may be call'd, during mo&s;t of which I re&s;ided at <HI>Rome,</HI> or at <HI>Venice,</HI> having only been twice at <HI>Florence,</HI> and once at <HI>Naples:</HI> I made &s;ome very diverting and u&s;eful Ob&s;ervations in all the&s;e Places; and particularly of the Conduct of the Ladies; for I had Opportunity to con|ver&s;e very much among them, by the Help of the old Witch that travell'd with us; &s;he had been at <HI>Naples,</HI> and at <HI>Venice,</HI> and had liv'd in the former &s;everal Years, where, as I found, &s;he had liv'd but a loo&s;e Life, as indeed the Women of <HI>Naples</HI> generally do; and,
<PB N="110" REF="108">
in &s;hort, I found &s;he was fully acquainted with all the intriguing Arts of that Part of the World.</P>
<P>Here my Lord bought me a little female <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Slave, who being taken at Sea by a <HI>Malthe&s;e</HI> Man of War, was brought in there; and of her I learnt the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Lan|guage, their Way of Dre&s;&s;ing, and Dancing, and &s;ome <HI>Turki&s;h,</HI> or rather <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> Songs, of which I made U&s;e, to my Advantage, on an extraordinary Occa&s;ion, &s;ome Years after, as you &s;hall hear in its Place. I need not &s;ay I learnt <HI>Italian</HI> too, for I got pretty well Mi&s;tre&s;s of that, before I had been there a Year; and as I had Lei&s;ure enough, and lov'd the Language, I read all the <HI>Italian</HI> Books I cou'd come at.</P>
<P>I began to be &s;o in Love with <HI>Italy,</HI> e&s;pecially with <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Venice,</HI> that I cou'd have been very well &s;a|tisfied to have &s;ent for <HI>Amy,</HI> and have taken up my Re|&s;idence there for Life.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Rome,</HI> I did not like it at all: The Swarms of Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks of all Kinds, on one &s;ide, and the &s;coun|drel Rabbles of the common People, on the other, make <HI>Rome</HI> the unplea&s;ante&s;t Place in the World to live in; the innumerable Number of Valets, Lacqueys, and other Servants, is &s;uch, that they us'd to &s;ay, that there are very few of the common People in <HI>Rome,</HI> but what have been Footmen, or Porters, or Grooms to Cardinals, or foreign Amba&s;&s;adors: In a Word, they have an Air of &s;harping and couzening, quarrelling and &s;colding, upon their general Behaviour; and when I was there, the Footmen made &s;uch a Broil between two great Fa|milies in <HI>Rome,</HI> about which of their Coaches (the Ladies being in the Coaches on either &s;ide) &s;hou'd give Way to t'other, that there was above thirty People wounded on both Sides, five or &s;ix kill'd outright, and both the La|dies frighted almo&s;t to Death.</P>
<P>But I have no Mind to write the Hi&s;tory of my Tra|vels on this Side of the World, at lea&s;t, not now; it would be too full of Variety.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not, however, omit, that the Prince continued in all this Journey, the mo&s;t kind, obliging Per&s;on to me in the World; and &s;o con&s;tant, that tho' we were in a Country, where 'tis well known all Manner of
<PB N="111" REF="109">
Liberties are taken, I am yet well a&s;&s;ur'd, he neither took the Liberty he knew he might have, or &s;o much as de&s;ir'd it.</P>
<P>I have often thought of this noble Per&s;on, on that Account; had he been but half &s;o true, &s;o faithful and con&s;tant to the be&s;t Lady in the World, I mean his Prince&s;s, how glorious a Virtue had it been in him? and how free had he been from tho&s;e ju&s;t Reflections which touch'd him, in her Behalf, when it was too late.</P>
<P>We had &s;ome very agreeable Conver&s;ations upon this Subject; and once he told me, with a kind of more than ordinary Concern upon his Thoughts, that he was great|ly beholden to me for taking this hazardous and difficult Journey, for that I had kept him hone&s;t: I look'd up in his Face, and colour'd as red as Fire: Well, well, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> do not let that &s;urprize you; I do &s;ay, you have kept me hone&s;t: My Lord, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> 'tis not for me to explain your Words, but I wi&s;h I cou'd turn 'em my own Way; I hope, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> and believe we are both as hone&s;t as we can be, in our Circum&s;tances; ay, ay, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> and hone&s;ter than I doubt I &s;hou'd have been, if you had not been with me; I cannot &s;ay but if you had not been here, I &s;hould have wandered among the gay World here, in <HI>Naples,</HI> and in <HI>Venice</HI> too; for 'tis not &s;uch a Crime here, as 'tis in other Places; but I prote&s;t, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I have not touch'd a Woman in <HI>Italy,</HI> but your|&s;elf; and more than that, I have not &s;o much as had any De&s;ire to it; &s;o that, I &s;ay, you have kept me hone&s;t.</P>
<P>I was &s;ilent, and was glad that he interrupted me, or kept me from &s;peaking, with ki&s;&s;ing me, for really I knew not what to &s;ay: I was once going to &s;ay, that if his Lady, the Prince&s;s, had been with him, &s;he wou'd, doubtle&s;s, have had the &s;ame Influence upon his Virtue, with infinitely more Advantage to him; but I con&s;ider'd this might give him Offence; and be&s;ides, &s;uch Things might have been dangerous to the Circum&s;tance I &s;tood in, &s;o it pa&s;s'd off: But I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I &s;aw that he was quite another Man, as to Women, than I under|&s;tood he had always been before; and it was a particular
<PB N="112" REF="110">
Satisfaction to me, that I was thereby convinc'd that what he &s;aid, was true, and that he was, as I may &s;ay, <HI>all my own.</HI></P>
<P>I was with Child again in this Journey, and lay-in at <HI>Venice,</HI> but was not &s;o happy as before. I brought him another Son, and a very fine Boy it was, but it liv'd not above two Months; nor, after the fir&s;t Touches of Affection (which are u&s;ual, I believe, to all Mother) were over, was I &s;orry the Child did not live, the ne|ce&s;&s;ary Difficulties attending it in our travelling being con&s;ider'd.</P>
<P>After the&s;e &s;everal Perambulations, my Lord told me, his Bu&s;ine&s;s began to clo&s;e, and we wou'd think of re|turning to <HI>France;</HI> which I was very glad of, but prin|cipally on Account of my Trea&s;ure I had there, which, as you have heard, was very con&s;iderable: It is true, I had Letters very frequently from my Maid <HI>Amy,</HI> with Accounts that every Thing was very &s;afe, and that was very much to my Satisfaction: However, as the Prince's Negotiations were at an End, and he was ob|lig'd to return, I was very glad to go; &s;o we return'd from <HI>Venice</HI> to <HI>Turin;</HI> and in the Way, I &s;aw the famous City of <HI>Milan;</HI> from <HI>Turin,</HI> we went over the Mountains again, as before, and our Coaches met us at <HI>P$nt a Voi&s;in,</HI> between <HI>Chamberry</HI> and <HI>Lyons;</HI> and &s;o by ea$y Journeys, we arriv'd &s;afely at <HI>Paris,</HI> having been ab&s;ent about two Years, wanting about eleven Days, as abore.</P>
<P>I found the little Family ju&s;t as we left them; and <HI>Amy</HI> cry'd for Joy, when &s;he &s;aw me, and I almo&s;t did the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The Prince took his Leave of me the Night before; for as he told me, he knew he &s;hou'd be met upon the Road by &s;everal Per&s;ons of Quality, and perhaps, by the Prince&s;s her&s;elf; &s;o we lay at two different Inns that Night, le&s;t &s;ome &s;hou'd come quite to the Place, as in|deed it happen'd.</P>
<P>After this, I &s;aw him not for above twenty Days, being taken-up in his Family, and al&s;o with Bu&s;ine&s;s; but he &s;ent me his Gentleman, to tell me the Rea&s;on of it; and bid me not be unea&s;y; and that &s;atisfied me effectually.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="111">
In all this Affluence of my good Fortune, I did not forget that I had been Rich and Poor once already, al|ternately; and that I ought to know, that the Cir|cum&s;tances I was now in, were not to be expected to la&s;t always; that I had one Child, and expected ano|ther: and if I bred often, it wou'd &s;omething impair me in the great Article that &s;upported my Intere&s;t, I mean, what he call'd Beauty; that as that declin'd, I might expect the Fire wou'd abate, and the Warmth with which I was now &s;o ca$re&s;s'd, wou'd cool, and in Time, like the other Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of great Men, I might be dropt again; and that, therefore, it was my Bu&s;ine&s;s to take Care that I &s;hou'd fall as &s;oftly as I cou'd.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, I did not forget, therefore, to make as good Provi&s;ion for my&s;elf, as if I had had nothing to have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted on, but what I now gain'd; whereas I had not le&s;s than ten thou&s;and Pounds, as I &s;aid above, which I had ama&s;s'd, or &s;ecur'd rather, out of the Ruins of my faithful Friend, the Jeweller; and which, he little think|ing of what was &s;o near him when he went out, told me, tho' in a kind of a Je&s;t, was all my own, if he was knock'd o'th' Head; and which upon that Title, I took Care to pre&s;erve.</P>
<P>My greate&s;t Difficulty now, was, how to &s;ecure my Wealth, and to keep what I had got; for I had greatly added to this Wealth, by the generous Bounty of the Prince&mdash;, and the more, by the private re|$r'd Manner of Living, which he rather de&s;ir'd for Pri|vacy, than Par&s;imony; for he &s;upply'd me for a more magnificent Way of Life than I de&s;ir'd, if it had been $roper.</P>
<P>I &s;hall cut &s;hort the Hi&s;tory of this pro&s;perous Wick|$dne&s;s, with telling you I brought him a third Son, within little more than eleven Months after our Return $om <HI>Italy;</HI> that now I liv'd a little more openly, and $ent by a particular Name which he gave me abroad; at which I mu&s;t omit: <HI>viz.</HI> the Counte&s;s <HI>de&mdash;,</HI> and $d Coaches and Servants, &s;uitable to the Quality he $d given me the Appearance of; and which is more $an u&s;ually happens in &s;uch Ca&s;es, this held eight Years $m the Beginning; during which Time, as I had
<PB N="114" REF="112">
been very faithful to him, &s;o, I mu&s;t &s;ay, as above that I believe he was &s;o &s;eparated to me, that whereas he u&s;ually had two or three Women, which he kept privately, he had not in all that Time meddled with any of them, but that I had &s;o perfectly engro&s;s'd him, that he dropt them all; not, perhaps, that he &s;av'd much by it, for I was a very chargeable Mi&s;tre&s;s to him, that I mu&s;t acknowledge; but it was all owing to his particular Affection to me, not to my Extravagance; for, as I &s;aid, he never gave me leave to ask him for any Thing, but pour'd in his Favours and Pre&s;ents fa&s;ter than I expected, and &s;o fa&s;t, as I could not have the A&s;&s;urance to make the lea&s;t Mention of de&s;iring more.</P>
<P>Nor do I &s;peak this of my own Gue&s;s, I mean, about his Con&s;tancy to me, and his quitting all other Women; but the old <HI>Harradan,</HI> as I may call her, whom he made the Guide of our travelling, and who was a &s;trange old Creature, told me a thou&s;and Stories of his Gallantry, as &s;he call'd it, and how, as he had no le&s;s than three Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es at one Time, and, as I found, all of her procuring, he had of a Sudden, dropt them all, and that he was entirely lo&s;t to both her and them; that they did believe he had fallen into &s;ome new Hands, but &s;he could never hear who, or where, till he &s;ent for her to go this Journey; and then the old Hag complimented me upon his Choice, That &s;he did not wonder I had &s;o engro&s;s'd him; &s;o much Beauty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and there &s;he &s;topt.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I found by her, what was, you may be &s;ure, to my particular Satisfaction, <HI>viz.</HI> that as above, I had him all my own.</P>
<P>But the highe&s;t Tide has its Ebb; and in all Things of this Kind, there is a Reflux which &s;ometimes al&s;o is more impetuou&s;ly violent than the fir&s;t Aggre&s;&s;ion: My Prince was a Man of a va&s;t Fortune, tho' no Sove|reign, and therefore there was no Probability that the Expence of keeping a Mi&s;tre&s;s could be injurious to him, as to his E&s;tate; he had al&s;o &s;everal Employ|ments, both out of <HI>France,</HI> as well as in it; for, as above, I &s;ay, he was not a Subject of <HI>France,</HI> tho' he liv'd in that Court: he had a Prince&s;s, a Wife, with
<PB N="115" REF="113">
whom he had lived &s;everal Years, and a Woman <HI>(&s;o the Voice of Fame reported)</HI> the mo&s;t valuable of her Sex; of Birth equal to him, if not &s;uperior, and of Fortune proportionable; but in Beauty, Wit, and a thou&s;and good Qualities, &s;uperior not to mo&s;t Women, but even to all her Sex; and as to her Virtue, the Character which was mo&s;t ju&s;tly her due, was that of, not only the be&s;t of Prince&s;&s;es, but even the be&s;t of Women.</P>
<P>They liv'd in the utmo&s;t Harmony, as with &s;uch a Prince&s;s it was impo&s;&s;ible to be otherwi&s;e; but yet the Prince&s;s was not in&s;en&s;ible that her Lord had his <HI>Foible&s;s,</HI> that he did make &s;ome Excur&s;ions; and particularly, that he had one Favourite Mi&s;tre&s;s which &s;ometimes engro&s;s'd him more than &s;he (the Prince&s;s) cou'd wi&s;h, or be ea&s;ily &s;atisfied with: However, &s;he was &s;o good, &s;o generous, &s;o truly kind a Wife, that &s;he never gave him any Unea&s;ine&s;s on this Account; except &s;o much as mu&s;t ari&s;e from his Sen&s;e of her bearing the Affront of it with &s;uch Patience, and &s;uch a profound Re&s;pect for him, as was in it&s;elf enough to have reform'd him, and did &s;ometimes &s;hock his generous Mind, &s;o as to keep him at Home, as I may call it, a great while to|gether; and it was not long before I not only perceiv'd it by his Ab&s;ence, but really got a Knowledge of the Rea&s;on of it, and once or twice he even acknowledg'd it to me.</P>
<P>It was a Point that lay not in me to manage; I made kind of Motion, once or twice, to him, to leave me, and keep him&s;elf to her, as he ought by the Laws and $ites of Matrimony to do, and argu'd the Genero&s;ity $f the Prince&s;s to him, to per&s;wade him; but I was a $ypocrite; for had I prevail'd with him really to be $$ne&s;t, I had lo&s;t him, which I could not bear the thoughts of; and he might ea&s;ily &s;ee I was not in $ne&s;t. One Time in particular, when I took upon to talk at this rate, I found when I argued &s;o much the Virtue and Honour, the Birth, and above all, generous U&s;age he found in the Per&s;on of the Prin|$$$ with Re&s;pect to his private Amours, and how it
<PB N="116" REF="114">
&s;hould prevail upon him, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I found it began to af|fect him, and he return'd, <HI>And do you indeed,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>per&s;wade me to leave you? Would you have me think you &s;incere?</HI> I look'd up in his Face, &s;miling, <HI>Not for any other Favourite,</HI> my Lord, &s;aid I; <HI>that wou'd break my Heart;</HI> but <HI>for Madam, the Prince&s;s!</HI> &s;aid I, and then I could &s;ay no more, Tears follow'd. and I &s;at &s;ilent a while: Well, &s;aid he, if ever I do leave you, it &s;hall be on the virtuous Account; it &s;hall be for the Prince&s;s, I a&s;&s;ure you it &s;hall be for no other Woman; <HI>That's enough, my Lord,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>There I ought to &s;ubmit; and while I am a&s;&s;ured it &s;hall be for no other Mi&s;tre&s;s, I pro|mi&s;e your Highne&s;s, I will not repine;</HI> or that, if I do, <HI>it &s;hall be a &s;ilent Grief, it &s;hall not interrupt your Felicity.</HI></P>
<P>All this while I &s;aid I knew not what, and &s;aid what I was no more able to do, than he was able to leave me: which, at that Time, he own'd he cou'd not do, no, not for the Prince&s;s her&s;elf.</P>
<P>But another Turn of Affairs determin'd this Matter, for the Prince&s;s was taken very ill, and in the Opinion of all her Phy&s;icians, very dangerou&s;ly &s;o. In her Sick|ne&s;s &s;he de&s;ir'd to &s;peak with her Lord, and to take her Leave of him: At this grievous Parting, &s;he &s;aid &s;o ma$$ pa&s;&s;ionate kind Things to him; lamented that &s;he $$ left him no Children, (&s;he had had three, but they were dead) hinted to him, that it was one of the chief Things which gave her Satisfaction in Death, as to this World, that &s;he &s;hould leave him Room to have Heirs to his Family, by &s;ome Prince&s;s that &s;hould &s;upply her Place; with all Humility, but with a Chri&s;tian Earne&s;tne&s;s, recommended to him to do Ju&s;tice to &s;uch Prince&s;s, whoever it &s;hould be, from whom, to be &s;ure, he would expect Ju&s;tice; that is to &s;ay, to keep to her &s;ingly, according to the &s;olemne&s;t Part of the Marriage-covenant; humbly ask'd his High|ne&s;s Pardon, if &s;he had any way offended him; and appealing to Heaven, before who&s;e Tribunal &s;he was to appear, that &s;he had never violated her Honour, or her Duty to him; and praying to Je&s;us, and the
<PB N="117" REF="115">
Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, for his Highne&s;s; and thus with the mo&s;t moving, and mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate Expre&s;&s;ions of her Affection to him, took her la&s;t Leave of him, and died the next Day.</P>
<P>This Di&s;cour&s;e from a Prince&s;s &s;o valuable in her&s;elf, and &s;o dear to him, and the Lo&s;s of her following &s;o immediately after, made &s;uch deep Impre&s;&s;ions on him, that he look'd back with Dete&s;tation upon the former Part of his Life; grew melancholy and re&s;erv'd; chang|ed his Society, and much of the general Conduct of his Life; re&s;olv'd on a Life regulated mo&s;t &s;trictly by the Rules of Virtue, and Piety; and in a Word, was quite another Man.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Part of his Reformation was a Storm upon me; for, about ten Days after the Prince&s;s's Funeral, he &s;ent a Me&s;&s;age to me by his Gentleman, intimating, tho' in very civil Terms, and with a &s;hort Preamble, or Introduction, that he de&s;ir'd I would not take it ill that he was oblig'd to let me know, that he could &s;ee me no more: His Gentleman told me a long Story of the new Regulation of Life his Lord had taken up, and that he had been &s;o afflicted for the Lo&s;s of his Prince&s;s, that he thought it would either &s;horten his Life, or he wou'd retire into &s;ome Religious Hou&s;e, to and his Days in Solitude.</P>
<P>I need not direct any body to &s;uppo&s;e how I receiv'd this News; I was indeed exceedingly &s;urpriz'd at it, and had much ado to &s;upport my&s;elf, when the fir&s;t Part of it was deliver'd; tho' the Gentleman deliver'd his Errand with great Re&s;pect, and with all the Regard $o me that he was able, and with a great deal of Ce|remony; al&s;o telling me how much he was concern'd $o bring me &s;uch a Me&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>But when I heard the Particulars of the Story at $rge, and e&s;pecially that of the Lady's Di&s;cour&s;e to the $ince, a little before her Death, I was fully &s;atisfied; knew very well he had done nothing but what any $an mu&s;t do, that had a true Sen&s;e upon him of the $$&s;tice of the Prince&s;s's Di&s;cour&s;e to him, and of the $ece&s;&s;ity there was of his altering his Cour&s;e of Life,

if he intended to be either a Chri&s;tian or an hone&s;t Man: I &s;ay, when I heard this, I was perfectly ea&s;y; I confe&s;s it was a Circum&s;tance that it might be rea&s;on|ably expected &s;hould have wrought &s;omething al&s;o up|on me; I that had &s;o much to reflect upon more than the Prince; that had now no more Temptation of Po|verty, or of the powerful Motive, which <HI>Amy</HI> u&s;ed with me, namely, <HI>comply and live; deny and &s;tarve;</HI> I &s;ay, I that had no Poverty to introduce Vice, but was grown not only well &s;upply'd, but rich, and not only rich, but was very rich; in a Word, richer than I knew how to think of; for the Truth of it was, that thinking of it &s;ometimes almo&s;t di&s;tracted me, for Want of knowing how to di&s;po&s;e of it, and for Fear of lo&s;ing it all again by &s;ome Cheat or Trick, not knowing any Body that I could commit the Tru&s;t of it to.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, I &s;hould add at the Clo&s;e of this Affair, that the Prince did not, as I may &s;ay, turn me off rudely, and with Di&s;gu&s;t; but with all the Decency and Good|ne&s;s peculiar to him&s;elf, and that could con&s;i&s;t with a Man reformed, and &s;truck with the Sen&s;e of his hav|ing abus'd &s;o good a Lady as his late Prince&s;s had been; nor did he &s;end me away empty, but did every Thing like him&s;elf; and in particular, ordered his Gentleman to pay the Rent of the Hou&s;e, and all the Expence of his two Sons; and to tell me how they were taken Care of, and where; and al&s;o that I might at all times in&s;pect the U&s;age they had, and if I di&s;lik'd any Thing it &s;hould be rectify'd; and having thus fini&s;hed every Thing, he retir'd into <HI>Lorrain,</HI> or &s;omewhere that Way, where he had an E&s;tate, and I never heard o$ him more, I mean, not as a Mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Now I was at Liberty to go to any Part of the World, and take Care of my Money my&s;elf. The fir&s;t Thing that I re&s;olved to do, was to go directly to <HI>England,</HI> for there, I thought, being among my Country folks, (for I e&s;teemed my&s;elf an <HI>Engli&s;h-Wo+man,</HI> tho' I was born in <HI>France)</HI> for there, I &s;ay, thought I could better manage Things than in <HI>France</HI>

at lea&s;t, that I would be in le&s;s Danger of being cir|cumvented and deceived; but how to get away with &s;uch a Trea&s;ure as I had with me, was a difficult Point, and what I was greatly at a Lo&s;s about.</P>
<P>There was a <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant in <HI>Paris,</HI> that was a Per&s;on of great Reputation for a Man of Sub&s;tance and of Hone&s;ty, but I had no Manner of Acquaintance with him, nor did I know how to get acquainted with him, &s;o as to di&s;cover my Circum&s;tances to him; but at la&s;t I employed my Maid <HI>Amy,</HI> &s;uch I mu&s;t be allowed to call her, (notwith&s;tanding what has been &s;aid of her) becau&s;e &s;he was in the Place of a Maid-&s;ervant; I &s;ay, I employed my Maid <HI>Amy</HI> to go to him, and &s;he got a Recommendation to him from &s;omebody el&s;e, I knew not who; &s;o that &s;he got Acce&s;s to him well enough.</P>
<P>But now was my Ca&s;e as bad as before; for when I came to him, what could I do? I had Money and Jew|els to a va&s;t Value, and I might leave all tho&s;e with him; that I might indeed do; and &s;o I might with &s;e|veral other Merchants in <HI>Paris,</HI> who would give me Bills for it payable at <HI>London,</HI> but then I ran a Hazard of my Money; and I had no Body at <HI>London</HI> to &s;end the Bills to, and &s;o to &s;tay till I had an Account that they were accepted; for I had not one Friend in <HI>Lon|don,</HI> that I could have Recour&s;e to, &s;o that indeed I knew not what to do.</P>
<P>In this Ca&s;e I had no Remedy, but that I mu&s;t tru&s;t &s;omebody; &s;o I &s;ent <HI>Amy</HI> to this <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant, as I &s;aid above. He was a little &s;urprized when <HI>Amy</HI> came to him, and talk'd to him of remitting a Sum of about 12000 Pi&s;toles to <HI>England,</HI> and began to think &s;he came to put &s;ome Cheat upon him; but when he found that <HI>Amy</HI> was but a Servant, and that I came to him my&s;elf, the Ca&s;e was alter'd pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>When I came to him my&s;elf, I pre&s;ently &s;aw &s;uch a Plainne&s;s in his Dealing, and &s;uch Hone&s;ty in his Coun|tenance, that I made no Scruple to tell him my whole Story, <HI>viz.</HI> That I was a Widow; that I had &s;ome Jewels to di&s;po&s;e of, and al&s;o &s;ome Money, which I had a Mind to &s;end to <HI>England,</HI> and to follow there

my&s;elf; but being but a Woman, and having no Cor|re&s;pondence in <HI>London,</HI> or any where el&s;e, I knew not what to do, or how to &s;ecure my Effects.</P>
<P>He dealt very candidly with me, and advi&s;ed me, when he knew my Ca&s;e &s;o particularly, to take Bills upon <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> and to go that Way to <HI>England;</HI> for that I might lodge my Trea&s;ure in the Bank there, in the mo&s;t &s;ecure Manner in the World; and that there he could recommend me to a Man who perfectly under|&s;tood Jewels, and would deal faithfully with me in the di&s;po&s;ing them.</P>
<P>I thank'd him, but &s;crupled very much the travel|ling &s;o far in a &s;trange Country, and e&s;pecially with &s;uch a Trea&s;ure about me; that whether known or concealed I did not know how to venture with it: Then he told me he would try to di&s;po&s;e of them there, that is, at <HI>Paris,</HI> and convert them into Money, and &s;o get me Bills for the whole; and in a few Days he brought a <HI>Jew</HI> to me who pretended to buy the Jewels.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the <HI>Jew</HI> &s;aw the Jewels, I &s;aw my Fol|ly; and it was ten thou&s;and to one but I had been ra|ined, and perhaps put to Death in as cruel a Manner as po&s;&s;ible; and I was put in &s;uch a Fright by it, that I was once upon the Point of flying for my Life, and leaving the Jewels and Money too, in the Hands of the <HI>Dutchman,</HI> without any Bills or any Thing el&s;e. The Ca&s;e was thus:</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the <HI>Jew</HI> &s;aw the Jewels, he falls a job|bering in <HI>Dutch</HI> or <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> to the Merchant, and I could pre&s;ently perceive that they were in &s;ome great Surprize both of them. The <HI>Jew</HI> held up his Hands, look'd at me with &s;ome Horror, then talked <HI>Dutch</HI> again, and put him&s;elf into a thou&s;and Shapes, twi&s;t|ing his Body, and wringing up his Face this Way and that Way, in his Di&s;cour&s;e; &s;tamping with his Feet, and throwing abroad his Hands, as if he was not in a Rage only, but in a meer Fury. Then he would turn, and give a Look at me, like the Devil. I thought I ne|ver &s;aw any Thing &s;o frightful in my Life.</P>

<P>No, no, Madam, <HI>&s;ays the</HI> Dutchman, very kindly, you mu&s;t not go, all our Di&s;cour&s;e was about you, and your Jewels, and you &s;hall hear it pre&s;ently, it con|cerns you very much, I a&s;&s;ure you: Concern me, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> what can it concern me &s;o much, as to put this Gen|tleman into &s;uch Agonies, and what makes him give me &s;uch Devil's Looks as he does? Why, he looks as if he would devour me.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jew</HI> under&s;tood me pre&s;ently, continuing in a kind of Rage, and &s;poke in <HI>French,</HI> Yes, Madam, it does concern you very much, very much, very much, re|peating the Words, &s;haking his Head; and then turn|ing to the <HI>Dutchman,</HI> Sir, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> pray tell her what is the Ca&s;e; no, <HI>&s;ays the Merchant,</HI> not yet, let us talk a little farther of it by our&s;elves; upon which, they withdrew into another Room, where &s;till they talk'd very high, but in a Language I did not under&s;tand: I began to be a little &s;urpri&s;ed at what the <HI>Jew</HI> had &s;aid, you may be &s;ure, and eager to know what he meant, and was very impatient till the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant came back, and that &s;o impatient, that I called one of his Servants to let him know, I de&s;ired to &s;peak with him; when he came in, I asked his Pardon for being &s;o im|patient, but told him I could not be ea&s;y, till he had told me what the Meaning of all this was: Why Ma|dam, <HI>&s;ays the Dutch Merchant,</HI> in &s;hort, the Meaning is, what I am &s;urpri&s;ed at too: This Man is a <HI>Jew,</HI> and under&s;tands Jewels perfectly well, and that was the Rea&s;on I &s;ent for him, to di&s;po&s;e of them to him for you; but as &s;oon as he &s;aw them, he knew the Jewels very di&s;tinctly, and flying out in a Pa&s;&s;ion, as you &s;ee $e did, told me, in &s;hort, that they were the very Par|$el of Jewels which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Jeweller had about him,

who was robb'd going to <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> (about eight Years ago) to &s;hew them the Prince <HI>d'&mdash;,</HI> and that it was for the&s;e very Jewels that the poor Gentleman was mur|dered; and he is in all this Agony to make me a&s;k you, how you came by them; and he &s;ays, you ought to be charged with the Robbery and Murder, and put to the Que&s;tion, to di&s;cover who were the Per&s;ons that did it, that they might be brought to Ju&s;tice: While he &s;aid this, the <HI>Jew</HI> came impudently back into the Room without calling, which a little &s;urpri&s;ed me again.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant &s;poke pretty good <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and he knew that the <HI>Jew</HI> did not under&s;tand <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> at all; &s;o he told me the latter Part, when the <HI>Jew</HI> came into the Room, in <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> at which I &s;mil'd, which put the <HI>Jew</HI> into his mad Fit again, and &s;haking his Head, and making his Devil's Faces again, he &s;eemed to threaten me for Laughing; &s;aying in <HI>French,</HI> This was an Affair I &s;hould have little Rea&s;on to laugh at, and the like; at this, I laugh'd again, and flouted him, let|ting him &s;ee that I &s;corn'd him; and turning to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant, <HI>Sir,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>That tho&s;e Jewels were be|longing to Mr.&mdash;, the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Jeweller,</HI> nam|ing his Name readily, <HI>in that,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>this Per&s;on is right, but that I &s;hould be que&s;tioned</HI> how I came to have them, <HI>is a Token of his Ignorance; which,</HI> however, <HI>he might have manag'd with a little more good Manners, till I had told him who I am; and both he and you too will be more ea&s;y in that Part, when I &s;hould tell you that I am the unhappy Widow of that Mr.&mdash;, who was &s;o bar|barou&s;ly murdered going to</HI> Ver&s;ailles; <HI>and that he was not robb'd of tho&s;e Jewels, but of others; Mr.&mdash;having left tho&s;e behind him with me, le&s;t he &s;hould be robb'd; had I,</HI> Sir, <HI>come otherwi&s;e by them, I &s;hould not have been weak enough to have expo&s;ed them to Sale here, where the Thing was done, but have carried them far|ther off.</HI></P>
<P>This was an agreeable Surpri&s;e to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Mer|chant, who being an hone&s;t Man him&s;elf, believed e|very Thing I &s;aid, which indeed being all really and literally true, except the Deficiency of my Marriage,

I &s;poke with &s;uch an unconcerned Ea&s;ine&s;s, that it might plainly be &s;een that I had no Guilt upon me, as the <HI>Jew</HI> &s;ugge&s;ted.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jew</HI> was confounded when he heard that I was the <HI>Jeweller's</HI> Wife; but as I had rai&s;ed his Pa&s;&s;ion, with &s;aying he look'd at me with a Devil's Face, he &s;tudied Mi&s;chief in his Heart, and an&s;wer'd, <HI>That &s;hould not &s;erve my Turn;</HI> &s;o called the <HI>Dutchman</HI> out again, when he told him that he re&s;olved to pro&s;ecute this Mat|ter farther.</P>
<P>There was one kind Chance in this Affair, which indeed, was my Deliverance, and that was, that the Fool could not re&s;train his Pa&s;&s;ion, but mu&s;t let it fly to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant; to whom, when they withdrew a &s;econd Time, as above, he told that he would bring a Proce&s;s again&s;t me for the Murther; and that it &s;hould co&s;t me dear, for u&s;ing him at that rate; and <HI>away he went,</HI> de&s;iring the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant to tell him when I wou'd be there again: Had he &s;u&s;pected that the <HI>Dutch|man</HI> wou'd have communicated the Particulars to me, he wou'd never have been &s;o fooli&s;h as to have men|tion'd that Part to him,</P>
<P>But the Malice of his Thoughts anticipated him, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant was &s;o good, as to give me an Account of his De&s;ign, which indeed was wicked enough in its Nature; but to me it would have been wor&s;e, than otherwi&s;e it wou'd to another; for upon Examination, I cou'd not have prov'd my&s;elf to be the Wi&s;e of the Jeweller, &s;o the Su&s;picion might have been carried on with the better Face; and then I &s;hou'd al&s;o have brought all his Relations in <HI>England</HI> upon me; who finding by the Proceedings, that I was not his Wife, but a Mi&s;tre&s;s, or in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> a Whore, wou'd immediately have laid Claim to the Jewels, as I had own'd them to be his.</P>
<P>This Thought immediately ru&s;h'd into my Head, as &s;oon as the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant had told me, what wicked Things were in the Head of that cur&s;ed <HI>Jew;</HI> and the Villain (for &s;o I mu&s;t call him) convinc'd the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant that he was in earne&s;t, by an Expre&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="124" REF="122">
which &s;hewed the re&s;t of his De&s;ign, and that was a Plot to get the re&s;t of the Jewels into his Hand.</P>
<P>When fir&s;t he hinted to the <HI>Dutchman,</HI> that the Jew|els were &s;uch a Man's, meaning my Husband's, he made wonderful Explanations on Account of their having been concealed &s;o long; where mu&s;t they have lain? And what was the Woman that brought them? And that &s;he, meaning me, ought to be immediately apprehended, and put into the Hands of Ju&s;tice; and this was the Time that, as I &s;aid, he made &s;uch horrid Ge&s;tures, and look'd at me &s;o like a Devil.</P>
<P>The Merchant hearing him talk at that Rate, and &s;eeing him in earne&s;t, &s;aid to him, Hold your Tongue a little, this is a Thing of Con&s;equence; if it be &s;o, let you and I go into the next Room and con&s;ider of it there; and &s;o they withdrew, and left me.</P>
<P>Here, as before, I was unea&s;y, and called him out, and having heard how it was, gave him that An&s;wer, <HI>that I was his Wife,</HI> or Widow, which the malicious <HI>Jew</HI> &s;aid <HI>&s;hould not &s;erve my Turn;</HI> and then it was, that the <HI>Dutchman</HI> called him out again; and in this Time of his withdrawing, the Merchant finding, as a|bove, that he was really in earne&s;t, counterfeited a little to be of his Mind, and entered into Propo&s;als with him for the Thing it&s;elf.</P>
<P>In this they agreed to go to an Advocate or Council, for Directions how to proceed, and to meet again the next Day, again&s;t which Time the Merchant was to ap|point me to come again with the Jewels, in Order to &s;ell them: <HI>No,</HI> &s;ays the Merchant, <HI>I will go farther with her than &s;o; I will de&s;ire her to leave the Jewels with me, to &s;hew to another Per&s;on, in order to get the better Price for them: That's right,</HI> &s;ays the <HI>Jew, and I'll engage &s;he &s;hall never be Mi&s;tre&s;s of them again; they &s;hall either be &s;eiz'd by us,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>in the King's Name, or &s;he &s;hall be glad to give them up to us, to prevent her being put to the Torture.</HI></P>

<P>I told him if I was &s;ure to have Ju&s;tice I would not fear all that &s;uch a Rogue could do to me; but how &s;uch Things were carried on in <HI>France</HI> I knew not. I told him the greate&s;t Difficulty would be to prove our Marriage, for that it was done in <HI>England,</HI> and in a remote Part of <HI>England</HI> too, and which was wor&s;e, it would be hard to produce authentic Vouchers of it, becau&s;e we were mar|ried in Private: <HI>But as to the Death of your Husband, Madam, what can be &s;aid to that?</HI> &s;aid he; <HI>Nay,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>what can they &s;ay to it?</HI> In <HI>England,</HI> added I, if they would offer &s;uch an Injury to any one, they mu&s;t prove the Fact, or give ju&s;t Rea&s;on for their Su&s;picions; that my Husband was murdered, that every one knows; but that he was robb'd, or of what, or how much, that none knows, no, not my&s;elf; and why was I not que&s;tion'd for it then? I have liv'd in <HI>Paris</HI> ever &s;ince, liv'd publickly, and no Man had yet the Impudence to &s;ugge&s;t &s;uch a Thing of me.</P>
<P>I am fully &s;atisfied of that, <HI>&s;ays the Merchant;</HI> but as this is a Rogue, who will &s;tick at nothing, what can we &s;ay? And who knows what he may &s;wear? Suppo&s;e he &s;hould &s;wear that he knows your Husband had tho&s;e particular Jewels with him the Morning when he went out, and that he &s;hewed them to him, to con&s;ider their Value, and what Price he &s;hould ask the Prince <HI>de&mdash;</HI>for them.</P>
<P>Nay, by the &s;ame Rule, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> he may &s;wear, that I murder'd my Husband, if he finds it for his Turn: That's true, &s;aid he; and if he &s;hou'd, I do not &s;ee what cou'd &s;ave you; but, added he, I have found out his more immediate De&s;ign; his De&s;ign is to have you carried to the <HI>Chatellette,</HI> that the Su&s;picion may appear ju&s;t; and then to get the Jewels out of your Hands, if po&s;&s;ible; then, at la&s;t, to drop the Pro&s;ecution, on your con&s;enting to quit the Jewels to him; and how
<PB N="126" REF="124">
you will do to avoid this, is the Que&s;tion, which I would have you con&s;ider of.</P>
<P>My Misfortune, Sir, &s;aid I, is, that I have no Time to con&s;ider, and I have no Per&s;on to con&s;ider with, or ad|vi&s;e about it; I find, that Innocence may be oppre&s;s'd by &s;uch an impudent Fellow as this; he that does not value a Perjury, has any Man's Life at his Mercy; but Sir, &s;aid I, is the Ju&s;tice &s;uch here, that while I may be in the Hands of the Publick, and under Pro&s;ecution, he may get hold of my Effects, and get my Jewels into his Hands?</P>
<P>I don't know, &s;ays he, what may be done in that Ca&s;e; but if not he, if the Court of Ju&s;tice &s;hou'd get hold of them, I do not know but you may find it as difficult to get them out of their Hands again, and, at lea&s;t, it may co&s;t you half as much as they are worth; &s;o I think it would be a much better Way, to prevent their coming at them at all.</P>
<P>But what Cour&s;e can I take to do that, &s;ays I, now they have got Notice that I have them? If they get me into their Hands, they will oblige me to produce them, or perhaps, &s;entence me to Pri&s;on till I do.</P>
<P>Nay, &s;ays he, as this Brute &s;ays too, put you to the Que&s;tion, that is to the Torture, on Pretence of making you confe&s;s who were the Murderers of your Husband.</P>
<P>Confe&s;s! &s;aid I, how can I confe&s;s what I know no|thing of?</P>
<P>If they come to have you to the Rack, &s;aid he, they will make you confe&s;s you did it your&s;elf, whether you did it or no, and then you are ca&s;t.</P>

<P>This was too kind an Offer for me, as Things &s;tood, not to be accepted and be thankful for; and as to going away I had prepared every Thing for parting, &s;o that I had little to do but to go back, to take two or three Boxes and Bundles and &s;uch Things, and my Maid <HI>Amy,</HI> and be gone.</P>
<P>Then the Merchant told me the Mea&s;ures he had re|&s;olyed to take to delude the <HI>Jew,</HI> while I made my E&s;|cape, which were very well contriv'd indeed. FIRST, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> when he comes to morrow I &s;hall tell him that I pro|po&s;ed to you to leave the Jewels with me, as we agreed, but that you &s;aid you would come and bring them in the Afternoon, &s;o that we mu&s;t &s;tay for you till four o'Clock; but then, at that Time, I will &s;hew a Letter from you, as if ju&s;t come in, wherein you &s;hall excu&s;e your not coming, for that &s;ome Company came to vi&s;it you, and prevented you; but that you de&s;ire me to take Care that the Gentleman be ready to buy your Jewels; and that you will come to morrow at the &s;ame Hour, without fail.</P>
<P>When to morrow is come, we &s;hall wait at the Time, but you not appearing, I &s;hall &s;eem mo&s;t di&s;&s;atisfied, and wonder what can be the Rea&s;on, and &s;o we &s;hall agree

<P>I could not but approve all his Mea&s;ures, &s;eeing they were &s;o well contriv'd, and in &s;o friendly a Manner, for my Benefit; and as he &s;eem'd to be &s;o very &s;incere, I re&s;olv'd to put my Life in his Hands. Immediately I went to my Lodgings, and &s;ent away <HI>Amy</HI> with &s;uch Bundles as I had prepared for my Travelling; I al&s;o &s;ent &s;everal Parcels of my fine Furniture to the Mer|chant's Hou&s;e to be laid up for me, and bringing the Key of the Lodgings with me, I came back to his Hou&s;e. Here we fini&s;hed our Matters of Money, and I deliver|ed into his Hand &s;even thou&s;and eight hundred Pi&s;toles in Bills and Money, a Copy of an A&s;&s;ignment on the Town-Hou&s;e of <HI>Paris</HI> for 4000 Pi&s;toles at 3 per <HI>Cent.</HI> Intere&s;t atte&s;ted, and a Procuration for receiving the In|tere&s;t half-yearly; but the Original I kept my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I could have tru&s;ted all I had with him, for he was perfectly hone&s;t, and had not the lea&s;t View of doing me any Wrong; indeed after it was &s;o apparent that he had, as it were, &s;av'd my Life, or at lea&s;t, &s;av'd me from being expo&s;ed and ruin'd; I &s;ay, after this how could I doubt him in any Thing?</P>
<P>When I came to him, he had every Thing ready I wanted, and as he had propo&s;ed; as to my Money, he gave me fir&s;t of all an accepted Bill, payable at <HI>Rotter|dam,</HI> for 4000 Pi&s;toles, and drawn from <HI>Genoa</HI> upon a Merchant at <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> payable to a Merchant at <HI>Paris,</HI>

<P>And now <HI>Amy</HI> and I were at Lei&s;ure to look upon the Mi&s;chiefs that we had e&s;cap'd; and had I had any Re|ligion, or any Sen&s;e of a &s;upreme Power managing, di|recting, and governing in both Cau&s;es and Events in this World, &s;uch a Ca&s;e as this wou'd have given any body Room to have been very thankful to the Power who had not only put &s;uch a Trea&s;ure into my Hand, but given me &s;uch an E&s;cape from the Ruin that threatned $ne; but I had none of tho&s;e Things about me; I had indeed, a grateful Sen&s;e upon my Mind of the generous Friend&s;hip of my Deliverer, the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant, by whom I was &s;o faithfully &s;erv'd, and by whom, as far $s relates to &s;econd Cau&s;es, I was pre&s;erv'd from De|&s;truction.</P>

<P>I was not quite a Stranger to the Sea, having come from <HI>Rochelle</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> when I was a Child, and gone from <HI>London,</HI> by the River <HI>Thames,</HI> to <HI>France</HI> af|terward, as I have &s;aid: But I began to be alarm'd $$ little with the terrible Clamour of the Men over my Head, for I had never been in a Storm, and &s;o had ne|ver &s;een the like, or heard it; and once, offering to look out at the Door of the Steerage, as they call'd it, it &s;truck me with &s;uch Horror, the Darkne&s;s, the Fierce|ne&s;s of the Wind, the dreadful Height of the Waves, and the Hurry the <HI>Dutch</HI> Sailors were in, who&s;e Lan|guage I did not under&s;tand one Word of, neither when they curs'd, or when they pray'd; I &s;ay, all the&s;e Things together, fill'd me with Terror; and, in &s;hort, I began to be very much frighted.</P>
<P>When I was come back into the great Cabbin there &s;at <HI>Amy,</HI> who was very Sea-&s;ick, and I had a little be|fore given her a Sup of Cordial waters, to help her Sto|mach: When <HI>Amy</HI> &s;aw me come back, and &s;i$ down without &s;peaking, for &s;o I did, &s;he look'd two or three Times up at me; at la&s;t &s;he came running to me, Dear Madam! &s;ays &s;he, what is the Matter? what makes you look &s;o pale? why, you a'nt well, what is the Matter? I &s;aid nothing &s;till, but held up my Hands two or three Times. <HI>Amy</HI> doubled her importunities; upon that, I &s;aid no more, but, <HI>&s;tep to the Steerage Door,</HI>
<PB N="132" REF="130">
<HI>and look out, as I did;</HI> &s;o &s;he went away immediately, and look'd too, as I had bidden her; but the poor Girl came back again in the greate&s;t Amazement and Hor|ror, that ever I &s;aw any poor Creature in, wringing her Hands, and crying out &s;he was undone! &s;he was undone! &s;he &s;hould be drown'd! they were all lo&s;t! Thus &s;he ran about the Cabbin like a mad Thing, and as perfectly out of her Sen&s;es, as any one in &s;uch a Ca&s;e cou'd be &s;uppos'd to be.</P>
<P>I was frighted my&s;elf; but when I &s;aw the Girl in &s;uch a terrible Agony, it brought me a little to my&s;elf, and I began to talk to her, and put her in a little Hope; I told her, there was many a Ship in a Storm, that was not ca&s;t away; and I hop'd we &s;hould not be drown'd; that it was true, the Storm was very dreadful, but I did not &s;ee that the Seamen were &s;o much con|cern'd as we were; and &s;o I talk'd to her as well as I $Word$, tho' my Heart was full enough of it, as well as <HI>Amy</HI>'s, and Death began to &s;tare in my Face, ay, and &s;omething el&s;e too, that is to &s;ay, Con&s;cience, and my Mind was very much di&s;turb'd, but I had no body to comfort me.</P>
<P>But <HI>Amy</HI> being in &s;o much wor&s;e a Condition, that is to &s;ay, &s;o much more terrify'd at the Storm, than I was, I had &s;omething to do to comfort her; &s;he was, as I have &s;aid, like one di&s;tracted, and went raving about the Cabbin, crying out &s;he was undone! undone! &s;he &s;hou'd be drown'd, and the like; and at la&s;t, the Ship giving a Jerk, by the Force, I &s;uppo&s;e, of &s;ome violent Wave, it threw poor <HI>Amy</HI> quite down, for &s;he was weak enough before with being Sea-&s;ick, and as it threw her forward, the poor Girl &s;truck her Head again&s;t the Bulk-head, as the Seamen call it, of the Cabbin, and laid her as dead as a Stone, upon the Floor, or Deck, that is to &s;ay, &s;he was &s;o to all Ap|pearance.</P>
<P>I cry'd out for Help; but it had been all one to have cry'd out on the Top of a Mountain, where no|body had been within five Miles of me; for the Sea|men were &s;o engag'd, and made &s;o much Noi&s;e, that
<PB N="133" REF="131">
no body heard me or came near me. I open'd the Great-Cabbin Door, and look'd into the Steerage, to cry for Help, but there, to encrea&s;e my Fright, was two Sea|men on their Knees, at Prayers, and only one Man who &s;teer'd, and he made a groaning Noi&s;e too, which I took to be &s;aying his Prayers, but it &s;eems it was an|&s;wering to tho&s;e above, when they call'd to him to tell him which Way to &s;teer</P>
<P>Here was no Help for me, or for poor <HI>Amy,</HI> and there &s;he lay &s;till &s;o, and in luch a Condition, that I did not know whether &s;he was dead or alive. In this Fright I went to her, and lifted her a little way up, &s;etting her on the Deck with her Back to the Boards of the Bulk-head, and I got a little Bottle out of my Pocket, and I held it to her No&s;e, and rubb'd her Temples, and what el&s;e I could do, but &s;till <HI>Amy</HI> &s;hew'd no Signs of Life, till I felt for her Pul&s;e, but could hardly di&s;tingui&s;h her to be alive; however, after a great while, &s;he began to revive, and in about half an Hour &s;he came to her&s;elf but remember'd nothing at fir&s;t of what had happen'd to her, for a good while more.</P>
<P>When &s;he recover'd more fully, &s;he ask'd me where &s;he was? I told her, &s;he was in the Ship yet, but God knows how long it might be; Why, Madam, &s;ays &s;he, is not the Storm over? <HI>No, no,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>Amy; why, Madam,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>it was calm ju&s;t now,</HI> (meaning when &s;he was in the &s;wooning Fit, occa&s;ion'd by her Fall) <HI>Calm,</HI> Amy, <HI>&s;ays I, 'tis far from being calm; it may be calm by and by, when we are all drown'd, and gone to</HI> HEAVEN.</P>
<P>HEAVEN! Madam, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> what makes you talk &s;o? HEAVEN!

Nay, I am guilty of my own Sin, and thine too: Then it came to my Remembrance, that I had not only been the &s;ame with <HI>Amy,</HI> but that I had been the Devil's In&s;trument, to make her wicked; that I had &s;tripp'd her, and pro&s;tituted her to the very Man that I had been naught with my&s;elf; that &s;he had but follow'd me; I had been her wicked Example; and I had led her into all; and that as we had &s;inn'd toge|ther, now we were likely to &s;ink together.</P>
<P>All this repeated it&s;elf to my Thoughts at that very Moment; and every one of <HI>Amy</HI>'s Cries &s;ounded thus in my Ears: I am the wicked Cau&s;e of it all; I have been thy Ruin, <HI>Amy,</HI> I have brought thee to this, and now thou art to &s;uffer for the Sin I have entic'd thee to; and if thou art lo&s;t for ever, <HI>what mu&s;t I be?</HI> what mu&s;t be my Portion?</P>
<P>It is true, this Difference was between us, that I &s;aid all the&s;e Things within my&s;elf, and &s;igh'd, and mourn|ed inwardly; but <HI>Amy,</HI> as her Temper was more vio|lent, &s;poke aloud, and cry'd, and call'd out aloud, like one in an Agony,</P>
<P>I had but &s;mall Encouragement to give her, and in|deed, cou'd &s;ay but very little; but I got her to com|po&s;e her&s;elf a little, and not let any of the People of the Ship under&s;tand what &s;he meant, or what &s;he &s;aid; but even in her greate&s;t Compo&s;ure, &s;he continued to expre&s;s her&s;elf with the utmo&s;t Dread and Terror, on Account of the wicked Life &s;he had liv'd; and crying out, &s;he &s;hould be damn'd, and the like; which was very terrible to me, who knew what Condition I was in my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e &s;erious Con&s;iderations, I was very peni|tent too, for my former Sins, and cry'd out, tho' &s;oft|ly, two or three Times, <HI>Lord have Mercy upon me;</HI> to

this, I added abundance of Re&s;olutions, of what a Life I would live, if it &s;hould plea&s;e God but to &s;pare my Life but this one Time; how I would live a &s;ingle and a virtuous Life, and &s;pend a great deal of what I had thus wickedly got, in Acts of Charity, and doing Good.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e dreadful Apprehen&s;ions, I look'd back on the Life I had led with the utmo&s;t Contempt and Abhorrence. I blu&s;h'd, and wonder'd at my&s;elf, how I cou'd act thus; how I cou'd dive&s;t my&s;elf of Mode&s;ty and Honour, and pro&s;titute my&s;elf for Gain; and I thought, if ever it &s;hould plea&s;e God to &s;pare me this one Time from Death, it wou'd not be po&s;&s;ible that I &s;hould be the &s;ame Creature again.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> went farther; &s;he pray'd, &s;he re&s;olv'd, &s;he vow'd to lead a new Life, if God wou'd &s;pare her but this Time; It now began to be Day-light, for the Storm held all Night long, and it was &s;ome Comfort to &s;ee the Light of another Day, which indeed, none of us expected; but the Sea went Mountains high, and the Noi&s;e of the Water was as frightful to us, as the Sight of the Waves; nor was any Land to be &s;een, nor did the Seamen know whereabout they were. At la&s;t, to our great Joy, they made Land, which was in <HI>England,</HI> and on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Suffolk;</HI> and the Ship be|ing in the utmo&s;t Di&s;tre&s;s, they ran for the Shore, at all Hazards, and with great Difficulty, got into <HI>Har|wich,</HI> where they were &s;afe, as to the Danger of Death; but the Ship was &s;o full of Water, and &s;o much damag|ed, that if they had not laid her on Shore the &s;ame Day, &s;he wou'd have &s;unk before Night, according to the Opinion of the Seamen, and of the Workmen on Shore too, who were hir'd to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in &s;topping their Leaks.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was reviv'd as &s;oon as &s;he heard they had e&s;py'd Land, and went out upon the Deck, but &s;oon came in again to me, <HI>O Madam,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>there's the Land in|deed, to be &s;een, it $ooks like a Ridge of Clouds, and may be all a Cloud for ought I know, but if it be Land, 'tis a great Way off; and the Sea is in &s;uch a Combu&s;tion, we</HI>

<P>I had conceiv'd &s;ome Hope, that if they &s;aw Land, we &s;hould be deliver'd; and I told her, &s;he did not un|der&s;tand Things of that Nature; that &s;he might be &s;ure if they &s;aw Land, they would go directly towards it, and wou'd make into &s;ome Harbour, but it was, as <HI>Amy</HI> &s;aid, a frightful Di&s;tance to it: The Land look'd like Clouds, and the Sea went as high as Mountains, &s;o that no Hope appear'd in the &s;eeing the Land; but we were in Fear of Foundring, before we cou'd reach it; this made <HI>Amy</HI> &s;o de&s;ponding &s;till; but as the Wind, which blew from the Ea&s;t, or that Way, drove us furiou&s;ly towards the Land; &s;o when, about half an Hour after, I &s;tept to the Steerage-door, and look'd out, I &s;aw the Land much nearer than <HI>Amy</HI> repre&s;ented it; &s;o I went in, and encourag'd <HI>Amy</HI> again, and in|deed was encourag'd my&s;elf.</P>
<P>In about an Hour, or &s;omething more, we &s;ee, to our infinite Satisfaction, the open Harbour of <HI>Harwich,</HI> and the Ve&s;&s;el &s;tanding directly towards it, and in a few Minutes more, the Ship was in &s;mooth Water, to our inexpre&s;&s;ible Comfort; and thus I had, tho' a|gain&s;t my Will, and contrary to my true Intere&s;t, what I wi&s;h'd for, to be driven away to <HI>England,</HI> though it was by a Storm.</P>
<P>Nor did this Incident do either <HI>Amy</HI> or me much Ser|vice; for the Danger being over, the Fears of Death vani&s;h'd with it; ay, and our Fear of what was be|yond Death al&s;o; our Sen&s;e of the Life we had liv'd went off, and with our return to Life, our wicked Ta&s;te of Life return'd, and we were both the &s;ame as before, if not wor&s;e: So certain it is, that the Repen|tance which is brought about by the meer Apprehen|&s;ions of Death, wears off as tho&s;e Apprehen&s;ions wear off; and Death-bed Repentance, or Storm-Repentance, which is much the &s;ame, is &s;eldom true.</P>

However, I do not tell you that this was all at once neither; the Fright we had at Sea la&s;ted a little while afterwards, at lea&s;t, the Impre&s;&s;ion was not quite blown off as &s;oon as the Storm; e&s;pecially poor <HI>Amy,</HI> as &s;oon as &s;he &s;et her Foot on Shore, &s;he fell flat upon the Ground and ki&s;s'd it, and gave God Thanks for her Deliver|ance from the Sea; and turning to me when &s;he got up, I hope, Madam, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> you will never go upon the Sea again.</P>
<P>I know not what ail'd me, not I; but <HI>Amy</HI> was much more penitent at Sea, and much more &s;en&s;ible of her Deliverance when &s;he landed, and was &s;afe, than I was; I was in a kind of Stupidity, I know not well what to call it; I had a Mind full of Horror in the Time of the Storm, and &s;aw Death before me as plainly as <HI>Amy,</HI> but my Thoughts got no Vent, as <HI>Amy</HI>'s did; I had a &s;ilent &s;ullen kind of Grief, which could not break out either in Words or Tears, and which was therefore much the wor&s;e to bear.</P>
<P>I had a Terror upon me for my wicked Life pa&s;t, and firmly believed I was going to the Bottom, launching into Death, where I was to give an Account of all my pa&s;t Actions; and in this State and on that Account, I look'd back upon my Wickedne&s;s with Abhorrence, as I have &s;aid above; but I had no Sen&s;e of Repentance, from the true Motive of Repentance, I &s;aw nothing of the Cor|ruption of Nature, the Sin of my Life, as an Offence again&s;t God, as a Thing odious to the Holine&s;s of his Being, as a|ba&s;ing his Mercy, and de&s;pi&s;ing his Goodne&s;s; in &s;hort, I had no thorow effectual Repentance, no Sight of my Sins in their proper Shape, no View of a Redeemer, or Hope in him: I had only &s;uch a Repentance as a Criminal has at the Place of Execution, who is &s;orry, not that he has com|mitted the Crime, as it is a Crime, but &s;orry <HI>that he is to be hang'd for it.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, <HI>Amy</HI>'s Repentance wore off too, as well as mine, but not &s;o &s;oon; however, we were both very grave for a Time.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we could get a Boat from the Town, we went on Shore, and immediately went to a Public-hou&s;e in the Town of <HI>Harwich;</HI> where we were to con&s;ider
<PB N="138" REF="136">
&s;eriou&s;ly what was to be done, and whether we &s;hould go up to <HI>London,</HI> or &s;tay till the Ship was refitted, which, they &s;aid, would be a Fortnight, and then go for <HI>Hol|land,</HI> as we intended, and as Bu&s;ine&s;s required.</P>
<P>Rea&s;on directed that I &s;hould go to <HI>Holland,</HI> for there I had all my Money to receive, and there I had Per&s;ons of good Reputation and Character to apply to, having Letters to them from the hone&s;t <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant at <HI>Pa|ris,</HI> and they might perhaps give me a Recommendati|on again to Merchants in <HI>London,</HI> and &s;o I &s;hould get ac|quainted with &s;ome People of Figure, which was what I loved; whereas now I knew not one Creature in the whole City of <HI>London,</HI> or any where el&s;e, that I could go and make my&s;elf known to: Upon the&s;e Con&s;idera|tions, I re&s;olved to go to <HI>Holland</HI> whatever came on it.</P>
<P>But <HI>Amy</HI> cry'd and trembled, and was ready to fall into Fits, when I did but mention going upon the Sea again, and begg'd of me not to go, or if I would go, that I would leave her behind, tho' I was to &s;end her a begging. The People in the Inn laugh'd at her, and je&s;ted with her, ask'd her if &s;he had any Sins to con|fe&s;s, that &s;he was a&s;ham'd &s;hould be heard of? And that &s;he was troubled with an evil Con&s;cience; told her if &s;he came to Sea, and to be in a Storm, if &s;he had lain with her Ma&s;ter, &s;he would certainly tell her Mi&s;tre&s;s of it; and that it was a common Thing for poor Maids to con|fe&s;s all the young Men they had lain with; that there was one poor Girl that went over with her Mi&s;tre&s;s, who&s;e Husband was a&mdash;r, in&mdash;, in the City of <HI>London,</HI> who confe&s;s'd, in the Terror of a Storm, that &s;he had lain with her Ma&s;ter and all the Apprentices &s;o often, and in &s;uch and &s;uch Places, and made the poor Mi&s;tre&s;s, when &s;he return'd to <HI>London,</HI> fly at her Hus|band, and make &s;uch a Stir as was indeed the Ruin of the whole Family. <HI>Amy</HI> could bear all that well enough; for tho' &s;he had indeed lain with her Ma&s;ter, it was with her Mi&s;tre&s;s's Knowledge and Con&s;ent, and which was wor&s;e, was her Mi&s;tre&s;s's own doing. <HI>I record it to the Reproach of my own Vice,</HI> and to expo&s;e the Exce&s;&s;es of &s;uch Wickedne&s;s, as they de&s;erve to be expo&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="137">
I thought <HI>Amy</HI>'s Fear would have been over by that Time the Ship would be gotten ready, but I found the Girl was rather wor&s;e and wor&s;e; and when I came to the Point that we mu&s;t go on Board or lo&s;e the Pa&s;&s;age, <HI>Amy</HI> was &s;o terrified that &s;he fell into Fits, &s;o the Ship went away without us.</P>
<P>But my going being ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, as above, I was obliged to go in the Packet-Boat &s;ome time after, and leave <HI>Amy</HI> behind at <HI>Harwich,</HI> but with Directions to go to <HI>London,</HI> and &s;tay there to receive Letters and Orders from me what to do. Now I was become from a Lady of Plea&s;ure a Woman of Bu&s;ine&s;s, and of great Bu&s;ine&s;s too, I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
<P>I got me a Servant at <HI>Harwich</HI> to go over with me, who had been at <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> knew the Place and &s;poke the Language, which was a great Help to me, and a|way I went. I had a very quick Pa&s;&s;age and plea&s;ant Weather, and coming to <HI>Rotterdam</HI> &s;oon found out the Merchant to whom I was recommended, who received me with extraordinary Re&s;pect; and fir&s;t he acknow|ledged the accepted Bill for 4000 Pi&s;toles, which he af|terwards paid punctually; other Bills that I had al&s;o pay|able at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> he procured to be received for me; and whereas one of the Bills for a thou&s;and two hundred Crowns was prote&s;ted at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> he paid it me him|self, for the Honour of the Endor&s;er, as he call'd it, which was my Friend, the Merchant at <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>There I entered into a Negociation by his Means for my Jewels, and he brought me &s;everal Jewellers to look $n them, and particularly one to value them, and to tell me what every Particular was worth: This was a Man who had great Skill in Jewels, but did not trade at that Time, and he was de&s;ired by the Gentleman that I was with, to &s;ee that I might not be impo&s;ed upon.</P>
<P>All this Work took me up near half a Year, and by $anaging my Bu&s;ine&s;s thus my&s;elf, and having large $ums to do with, I became as expert in it as any She-Merchant of them all; I had Credit in the Bank for a $$rge Sum of Money, and Bills and Notes for much $ore.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="138">
After I had been here about three Months, my Maid <HI>Amy</HI> writes me Word, that &s;he had received a Letter from her Friend, as &s;he called him, that, <HI>by the W$y,</HI> was the Prince's Gentleman, that had been <HI>Amy</HI>'s extra|ordinary Friend indeed; for <HI>Amy</HI> owned to me he had lain with her a hundred Times, that is to &s;ay, as often as he plea&s;ed; and perhaps in the eight Years which that Affair la&s;ted, it might be a great deal oftner: T$$s was what &s;he called her Friend, whom &s;he corre&s;ponded with upon this particular Subject; and among other Things &s;ent her this particular News, that my extra|ordinary Friend my real Husband, who rode in the $Word$ <HI>d'arms,</HI> was dead, that he was killed in a Rencounter, as they call it, or accidental Scuffle among the $Word$; and &s;o the Jade congratulated me upon my being now a real free Woman; and now, Madam, <HI>&s;ays $Word$, at the End of her Letter,</HI> you have nothing to do but to come hither and &s;et up a Coach, and a good Equipage, and if Beauty and a good Fortune won't make you a Dutche&s;s, nothing will; <HI>but I had not fix'd my Mea|&s;ures as yet.</HI> I had no Inclination to be a Wife again, I had had &s;uch bad Luck with my fir&s;t Husband, I hated the Thoughts of it. I found that a Wife is treated with Indifference, a Mi&s;tre&s;s with a &s;trong Pa&s;&s;ion; a Wife is look'd upon as but an Upper-&s;ervant, a Mi&s;tre&s;s is a So|vereign; a Wife mu&s;t give up all &s;he has, have every Re&s;erve &s;he makes for her&s;elf be thought hard of, and be upbraided with her very Pin-money; whereas a Mi|&s;tre&s;s makes the Saying true, <HI>that what the Man has,</HI> is hers, and <HI>what &s;he has,</HI> is her own; the Wife bears a thou&s;and In&s;ults, and is forc'd to &s;it &s;till and bear it, or part and be undone; a Mi&s;tre&s;s in&s;ulted helps her&s;elf im|mediately, and takes another.</P>
<P>The&s;e were my wicked Arguments for Whoring, for I never &s;et again&s;t them the Difference another Way, I may &s;ay, every other Way; <HI>how that,</HI> FIRST, A Wife appears boldly and honourably with her Husband, lives at Home and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es his Hou&s;e, his Servants, h$ S|quipages, and has a Right to them all, and to call them her own; entertains his Friends, owns his Children, and has the Return of Duty and Affection from them, as

they are here her own, and claims upon his E&s;tate, by the Cu&s;tom of <HI>England,</HI> if he dies and leaves her a Wi|dow.</P>
<P>The Whore &s;culks about in Lodgings, is vi&s;ited in the dark; di&s;own'd upon all Occa&s;ions before God and Man; is maintain'd indeed, for a Time, but is certain|ly condemn'd to be abandon'd at la&s;t, and left to the Mi&s;eries of Fate, and her own ju&s;t Di&s;a&s;ter: If &s;he has any Children, her Endeavour is to get rid of them, and not maintain them; and if &s;he lives, &s;he is certain to &s;ee them all hate her, and be a&s;hamed of her; while the Vice rages, and the Man is in the Devil's Hand, <HI>&s;he has him;</HI> and while &s;he has him, &s;he makes <HI>a Prey of him;</HI> but if he happens to fall &s;ick, if any Di&s;a&s;ter befals him, the Cau&s;e of all lies upon her; he is &s;ure to lay all his Misfortunes at her Door; and if once he comes to Re|pentance, or makes but one Step towards a Reformation, he begins with her, leaves her, u&s;es her as &s;he de&s;erves, hates her, abhors her, and <HI>&s;ees her no more;</HI> and that with this never-failing Addition, namely, That the more &s;incere and unfeigned his Repentance is, the more earn|e&s;tly he looks up, and the more effectually he looks in, the more his Aver&s;ion to her encrea&s;es, and he cur&s;es her from the Bottom of his Soul; nay, it mu&s;t be from a kind of Exce&s;s of Charity, if he &s;o much as wi&s;hes God may forgive her.</P>
<P>The oppo&s;ite Circum&s;tances of a <HI>Wife</HI> and <HI>Whore,</HI> are &s;uch and &s;o many, and I have &s;ince &s;een the Difference with &s;uch Eyes as I could dwell upon the Subject a great while, but my Bu&s;ine&s;s is Hi&s;tory; I had a long Scene of Folly yet to run over; perhaps the Moral of all my Story may bring me back again to this Part, and if it does, I &s;hall &s;peak of it fully.</P>
<P>While I continued in <HI>Holland</HI> I received &s;everal Letters from my Friend, (&s;o I had good Rea&s;on to call him) the Merchant in <HI>Paris,</HI> in which he gave me a farther Ac|count of the Conduct of that Rogue, the <HI>Jew,</HI> and $ow he acted after I was gone; how impatient he was while the &s;aid Merchant kept him in Su&s;pen&s;e, expecting we to come again; and how he raged when he found came no more.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="140">
It &s;eems, after he found I did not come, he found out by his unwearied Enquiry, where I had lived; and that I had been kept as a Mi&s;tre&s;s to &s;ome great Per&s;on, but he could never learn by whom, except that, he learnt the Colour of his Livery. In Pur&s;uit of this Enquiry he gue&s;s'd at the right Per&s;on, but could not make it out, or offer any po&s;itive Proof of it; but he found out the Prince's Gentleman, and talked &s;o &s;aucily to him of it, that the Gentleman treated him, as the <HI>French</HI> call it, <HI>au Coup de Batton;</HI> that is to &s;ay, can'd him very &s;e|verely, as he de&s;erv'd; and that not &s;atisfying him, or curing his In&s;olence, he was met one Night late upon the <HI>Pont Neuf,</HI> in <HI>Paris</HI> by two Men, who mufling him up in a great Cloak, carried him into a more private Place, and cut off both his Ears, telling him, it was for talking impudently of his Superiors; adding that he &s;hould take Care to govern his Tongue better, and be|have with more Manners, or the next Time they would cut his Tongue out of his Head.</P>
<P>This put a Check to his Saucine&s;s that Way; but he comes back to the Merchant, and threatned to begin a Proce&s;s again&s;t him, for corre&s;ponding with me, and being acce&s;&s;ary to the Murder of the Jeweller, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Merchant found by his Di&s;cour&s;e, that he &s;up|po&s;ed I was protected by the &s;aid Prince <HI>de&mdash;,</HI> nay, the Rogue &s;aid, he was &s;ure I was in his Lodgings at <HI>Ver&s;ailles; for he never had &s;o much as the lea&s;t Intima|tion of the Way I was really gone;</HI> but that I was there he was certain, and certain that the Merchant was pri|vy to it. The Merchant bid him Defiance; however, he gave him a great deal of Trouble, and put him to a great Charge, and had like to have brought him in for a Party to my E&s;cape, in which Ca&s;e he would have been oblig'd to have produced me, and that in the Penalty of &s;ome capital Sum of Money.</P>
<P>But the Merchant was too many for him another Way; for he brought an Information again&s;t him for a Cheat; wherein laying down the whole Fact, how he intended fal&s;ly to accu&s;e the Widow of the Jeweller for the &s;up|po&s;ed Murther of her Husband; that he did it purely to get the Jewels from her; and that he offered to bring
<PB N="143" REF="141">
him <HI>[the Merchant]</HI> in, to be confederate with him, and to &s;hare the Jewels between them; proving al&s;o his De|&s;ign to get the Jewels into his Hands, and then to have drop'd the Pro&s;ecution, upon Condition of my quitting the Jewels to him. Upon this Charge he got him laid by the Heels, &s;o he was &s;ent to the <HI>Concergerie,</HI> that is to &s;ay, to <HI>Bridewell,</HI> and the Merchant clear'd. He got out of Jail in a little while, tho' not without the Help of Money, and continued teizing the Merchant a long while, and at la&s;t threatned to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate and murder him; &s;o the Merchant, who having buried his Wife a|bout two Months before, was now a &s;ingle Man, and not knowing what &s;uch a Villain might do, thought fit to quit <HI>Paris,</HI> and came away to <HI>Holland</HI> al&s;o.</P>
<P>It is mo&s;t certain, that &s;peaking of Originals, I was the Source and Spring of all that Trouble and Vexati|on to this hone&s;t Gentleman; and as it was afterwards in my Power to have made him full Satisfaction, and did not, I cannot &s;ay but I added Ingratitude to all the re&s;t of my Follies; but of that I &s;hall give a fuller Ac|count pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>I was &s;urpri&s;ed one Morning, when being at the Mer|chant's Hou&s;e, whom he had recommended me to in <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> and being bu&s;y in his Compting-hou&s;e, ma|naging my Bills, and preparing to write a Letter to him to <HI>Paris,</HI> I heard a Noi&s;e of Hor&s;es at the Door, which is not very common in a City where every Body pa&s;&s;es by Water; but he had, it &s;eems, ferry'd over the <HI>Maez</HI> from <HI>William&s;tadt,</HI> and &s;o came to the very Door; and I looking towards the Door, upon hearing the Hor&s;es, &s;aw a Gentleman alight and come in at the Gate. I knew nothing, and expected nothing to be &s;ure of the Per&s;on; but, as I &s;ay, was &s;urprized, and indeed, more than ordinarily &s;urprized, when coming nearer to me, I &s;aw it was my Merchant of <HI>Paris,</HI> my Benefactor, and $ndeed my Deliverer.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s it was an agreeable Surprize to me, and I was exceeding glad to &s;ee him, who was &s;o honourable and $o kind to me, and who indeed had &s;av'd my Life. As $pon as he &s;aw me, he run to me, took me in his Arms, $nd ki&s;s'd me with a Freedom that he never offered to

take with me before: <HI>Dear Madam&mdash;,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>am glad to &s;ee you &s;afe in this Country, if you had &s;taid two Days longer in</HI> Paris <HI>you had been undone.</HI> I was &s;o glad to &s;ee him, that I could not &s;peak a good while, and I bur&s;t out into Tears without &s;peaking a Word for a Minute, but I recovered that Di&s;order, and &s;aid, <HI>The more, Sir, is my Obligation to you that &s;av'd my Life;</HI> and added, <HI>I am glad to &s;ee you here, that I may con&s;i|der how to ballance an Account, in which I am &s;o much your Debtor.</HI></P>
<P>You and I will adju&s;t that Matter ea&s;ily, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> now we are &s;o near together; pray where do you lodge? <HI>&s;ays he.</HI></P>
<P>In a very hone&s;t good Hou&s;e, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> where that Gentleman, your Friend, recommended me, pointing to the Merchant in who&s;e Hou&s;e we then were.</P>
<P>And where you may lodge too, Sir, <HI>&s;ays the Gentle|man,</HI> if it &s;uits with your Bu&s;ine&s;s, and your other Con|veniency.</P>
<P>With all my Heart, <HI>&s;ays he;</HI> then Madam, <HI>adds he,</HI> turning to me, I &s;hall be near you, and have Time to tell you a Story, which will be very long, and yet ma|ny Ways very plea&s;ant to you, how trouble&s;ome that devili&s;h Fellow, the <HI>Jew,</HI> has been to me on your Ac|count, and what a helli&s;h Snare he had laid for you, if he could have found you.</P>
<P>I &s;hall have Lei&s;ure too, Sir, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> to tell you all my Adventures &s;ince that; which have not been a few, I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, he took up his Lodgings in the &s;ame Hou&s;e where I lodg'd, and the Room he lay in opened. as he was wi&s;hing it would, ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to my Lodging|room, &s;o we could almo&s;t call out of Bed to one another, and I was not at all &s;hy of him on that Score, for I be|lieved him perfectly hone&s;t, and &s;o indeed he was; and if he had not, that Article was at pre&s;ent no Part of my Concern.</P>
<P>It was not till two or three Days, and after his fir&s;t Hurries of Bu&s;ine&s;s were over, that we began to enter into the Hi&s;tory of our Affairs on every Side, but when we began, it took up all our Conver&s;ation for almo&s;t a
<PB N="145" REF="143">
Fortnight. Fir&s;t I gave him a particular Account of e|very Thing that happened material upon my Voyage, and how we were driven into <HI>Harwich</HI> by a very terri|ble Storm, how I had left my Woman behind me, &s;o frighted with the Danger &s;he had been in, that &s;he dur&s;t not venture to &s;et her Foot into a Ship again any more, and that I had not come my&s;elf, if the Bills I had of him had not been payable in <HI>Holland;</HI> but that Money, he might &s;ee, would make a Woman go any where.</P>
<P>He &s;eem'd to laugh at all our womani&s;h Fears upon the Occa&s;ion of the Storm; telling me it was nothing but what was very ordinary in tho&s;e Seas; but that they had Harbours on every Coa&s;t &s;o near, that they were &s;eldom in Danger of being lo&s;t indeed; for, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> if they cannot fetch one Coa&s;t, they can always &s;tand away for another, and run afore it, <HI>as he called it,</HI> for one Side or other. But when I came to tell him what a crazy Ship it was, and how, even when they got into <HI>Har|wich,</HI> and into &s;mooth Water, they were fain to run the Ship on Shore, or &s;he would have &s;unk in the very Harbour; and when I told him that when I looked out at the Cabbin-door, I &s;aw the <HI>Dutchmen,</HI> one upon his Knees here, and another there at their Prayers, then in|deed he acknowledg'd I had Rea&s;on to be alarm'd; but &s;miling, <HI>he added,</HI> but you, Madam, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> are &s;o good a Lady, and &s;o pious, you would but have gone to Heaven a little the &s;ooner, the Difference had not been much to you.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, when he &s;aid this, it made all the Blood turn in my Veins, and I thought I &s;hould have fainted; poor Gentleman! thought I, you know little of me; what would I give to be indeed what you really think me to be! He perceived the Di&s;order, but &s;aid nothing till I &s;poke; when &s;haking my Head, <HI>O Sir,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>Death in any Shape has &s;ome Terror in it;</HI> but in the frightful Figure of a Storm at Sea, and a &s;inking Ship, it comes with a double, a treble, and indeed an inex|pre&s;&s;ible Horror; and if I were that Saint you think me to be, which (God knows) I am not, 'tis &s;till very di&s;|$mal; I de&s;ire to die in a Calm, if I can.

Di&s;cour&s;e, between &s;erious Reflection and Compliment, but I had too much Guilt to reli&s;h it as it was meant, &s;o I turn'd it off to &s;omething el&s;e, and talk'd of the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity I had on me to come to <HI>Holland;</HI> but I wi&s;h'd my&s;elf &s;afe on Shore in <HI>England</HI> again.</P>
<P>He told me he was glad I had &s;uch an Obligation up|on me to come over into <HI>Holland</HI> however; but hinted, that he was &s;o intere&s;ted in my Welfare, and be&s;ides, had &s;uch farther De&s;igns upon me, that if I had not &s;o happily been found in <HI>Holland,</HI> he was re&s;olved to have gone to <HI>England</HI> to &s;ee me; and that it was one of the principal Rea&s;ons of his leaving <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>I told him I was extremely obliged to him for &s;o far intere&s;ting him&s;elf in my Affairs; but that I had been &s;o far his Debtor before that I knew not how any Thing could encrea&s;e the Debt; for I ow'd my Life to him al|ready, and I could not be in Debt for any Thing more valuable than that.</P>
<P>He an&s;wer'd in the mo&s;t obliging Manner po&s;&s;ible, that he would put it in my Power to pay that Debt, and all the Obligations be&s;ides, that ever he had, or &s;hould be able to lay upon me.</P>
<P>I began to under&s;tand him now, and to &s;ee plainly, that he re&s;olved <HI>to make Love to me;</HI> but I would by no Means &s;eem to take the Hint, and be&s;ides I knew that he had a Wife with him in <HI>Paris;</HI> and I had, <HI>ju&s;t then, at lea&s;t,</HI> no Gu&s;t to any more intriguing; however, he &s;urpriz'd me into a &s;udden Notice of the Thing a little while after, by &s;aying &s;omething in his Di&s;cour&s;e, that he did, <HI>as he &s;aid,</HI> in his Wife's Days.

No, Madam, indeed, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> my Wife died the Beginning of <HI>September</HI> la&s;t; which, it &s;eems, was but a little after I came away.</P>
<P>We liv'd in the &s;ame Hou&s;e all this while; and as we lodg'd not far off from one another, Opportunities were not wanting of as near an Acquaintance as we might de|&s;ire; nor have &s;uch Opportunities the lea&s;t Agency in vicious Minds, to bring to pa&s;s even what they might not intend at fir&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="145">
However, tho' he courted &s;o much at a Di&s;tance, yet his Preten&s;ions were very honourable; and as I had be|fore found him a mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted Friend, and perfectly hone&s;t in his Dealings, even when I tru&s;ted him with all I had; &s;o now I found him &s;trictly virtuous, till I made him otherwi&s;e my&s;elf, even almo&s;t whether he would or no, as you &s;hall hear.</P>
<P>It was not long after our former Di&s;cour&s;e, when he repeated what he had in&s;inuated before, namely, that he had yet a De&s;ign to lay before me, which, if I would agree to his Propo&s;als, would more than ballance all Ac|counts between us. I told him I could not rea&s;onably deny him any Thing; and <HI>except one Thing, which I hop'd and believed he would not think of,</HI> I &s;hould think my&s;elf very ungrateful if I did not do every Thing for him that lay in my Power.</P>
<P>He told me what he &s;hould de&s;ire of me would be fully in my Power to grant, or el&s;e he &s;hould be very unfriendly to offer it, and &s;till, all this while, he de|clin'd making the Propo&s;al, <HI>as he call'd it,</HI> and &s;o, for that Time, we ended our Di&s;cour&s;e, turning it off to other Things; &s;o that, <HI>in &s;hort,</HI> I began to think he might have met with &s;ome Di&s;a&s;ter in his Bu&s;ine&s;s, and might have come away from <HI>Paris</HI> in &s;ome Di&s;credit; or had had &s;ome Blow on his Affairs in general; and as really I had Kindne&s;s enough to have parted with a good Sum to have helped him, and was in Gratitude bound to have done &s;o, <HI>he having &s;o effectually &s;aved</HI> to me <HI>all I had;</HI> &s;o I re&s;olved to make him the Offer, the fir&s;t Time I had an Opportunity, which two or three Days after offered it&s;elf very much to my Satisfaction.</P>
<P>He had told me at large, <HI>tho' on &s;everal Occa&s;ions,</HI> the Treatment he had met with from the <HI>Jew,</HI> and what Expence he had put him to; how at Length he had ca&s;t him, as above, and had recovered good Damage of him, but that the Rogue was unable to make him any Repa|ration; he had told me al&s;o, how the Prince <HI>d'&mdash;</HI>'s Gentleman had re&s;ented his Treatment of his Ma&s;ter; and how he had cau&s;ed him to be u&s;ed upon the <HI>Pont Neuf,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>as I have mention'd above;</HI> which I laugh'd at mo&s;t heartily.</P>

It is pity, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> that I &s;hould &s;it her and make that Gentleman no Amends; if you would direct me, Sir, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> how to do it, I would make him a hand&s;ome Pre&s;ent, and acknowledge the Ju&s;tice he had done to me, as well as to the Prince, his Ma&s;ter. He &s;aid he would do what I directed in it; &s;o I told him I would &s;end him 500 Crowns; <HI>That's too much,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>for you are but half intere&s;ted in the U&s;age of the</HI> Jew; <HI>it was on his Ma&s;ter's Account he corrected him, not on yours.</HI> Well, however, we were obliged to do nothing in it, for nei|ther of us knew how to direct a Letter to him, or to di|rect any Body to him; &s;o I told him I would leave it till I came to <HI>England,</HI> for that my Woman <HI>Amy</HI> cor|re&s;ponded with him, and that he had made Love to her.</P>
<P>Well, but Sir, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> as in Requital for his generous Concern for me, I am careful to think of him; it is but ju&s;t, that what Expence you have been obliged to be at, which was all on my Account, &s;hould be repaid you; and therefore, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> let me &s;ee<HI>&mdash;and there I pau&s;ed,</HI> and began to reckon up what I had ob&s;erved from his own Di&s;cour&s;e, it had co&s;t him in the &s;everal Di&s;putes and Hearings which he had with that <HI>Dog</HI> of a <HI>Jew,</HI> and I ca&s;t them up at &s;omething above 2130 Crowns; &s;o I pull'd out &s;ome Bills which I had upon a Merchant in <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> and a particular Account in Bank, and was looking on them, in Order to give them to him.</P>
<P>When he &s;eeing evidently what I was going about, in|terrupted me with &s;ome Warmth, and told me he would have nothing of me on that Account, and de&s;ired I would not pull out my Bills and Papers on that Score; that he had not told me the Story on that Account, or with any &s;uch View; that it had been his Misfortune fir&s;t to bring <HI>that ugly Rogue</HI> to me, which, tho' it was with a good De&s;ign, yet he would puni&s;h him&s;elf with the Expence he had been at, for his being &s;o unlucky to me; that I could not think &s;o hard of him, as to &s;up|po&s;e he would take Money of me, <HI>a Widow,</HI> for &s;erv|ing me, and doing Acts of Kindne&s;s to me in a &s;trange Country, and in Di&s;tre&s;s too; but, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> he would
<PB N="149" REF="147">
repeat what he had &s;aid before, that he kept me for a deeper Reckoning, and that, as he had told me, he would put me into a Po&s;ture to even all that Favour, as I called it, <HI>at once,</HI> &s;o we &s;hould talk it over another Time, and ballance all together.</P>
<P>Now I expected it would come out, but &s;till he put it off, as before, from whence I concluded it could not be Matter <HI>of Love,</HI> for that tho&s;e Things are not u&s;ually de|layed in &s;uch a Manner, and therefore it mu&s;t be Mat|ter of Money; upon which Thought I broke the Silence, and told him that as he knew I had, by Obligation, more Kindne&s;s for him than to deny any Favour to him that I could grant, and that he &s;eem'd backward to mention his Ca&s;e; I begg'd Leave of him to allow me to ask him, whether any Thing lay upon his Mind, with Re&s;pect to his Bu&s;ine&s;s and Effects in the World? that if it did, he knew what I had in the World as well as I did; and that if he wanted Money, I would let him have any Sum for his Occa&s;ion, as far as five or &s;ix thou&s;and Pi&s;toles, and he &s;hould pay me as his own Affairs would permit; and that if he never paid me, I would a&s;&s;ure him, that I would never give him any Trouble for it.</P>
<P>He ro&s;e up with Ceremony, and gave me Thanks in Terms that &s;ufficiently told me he had been bred among People more polite, and more courteous than is e&s;teemed the ordinary U&s;age of the <HI>Dutch;</HI> and after his Compli|ment was over he came nearer to me, and told me that he was obliged to a&s;&s;ure me, tho' with repeated Ac|knowledgments of my kind Offer, that he was not in any Want of Money; that he had met with no Unea&s;ine&s;s in any of his Affairs, no not of any Kind whatever, ex|cept that of the Lo&s;s of his Wife and one of his Chil|dren, which indeed had troubled him much; but that this was no Part of what he had to offer to me, and by granting which, I &s;hould ballance all Obligations; but that, in &s;hort, it was that &s;eeing Providence had (as it were for that Purpo&s;e) taken his Wife from him, I would make up the Lo&s;s to him; and with that he held me fa&s;t in his Arms, and ki&s;&s;ing me, would not give me Leave to &s;ay No, and hardly to breathe.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="148">
At length, having got Room to &s;peak, I told him, that, as I had &s;aid before, I could deny him but one Thing in the World, I was very &s;orry he &s;hould pro|po&s;e that Thing only that I cou'd not grant.</P>
<P>I cou'd not but &s;mile however, to my&s;elf, that he &s;hou'd make &s;o many Circles, and round about Mo|tions, to come at a Di&s;cour&s;e which had no &s;uch Rari|ty at the Bottom of it, if he had known all: But there was another Rea&s;on why I re&s;olv'd not to have him, when, at the &s;ame Time, if he had courted me in a Manner le&s;s hone&s;t or virtuous, I believe I &s;hou'd not have denied him; but I &s;hall come to that Part pre|&s;ently.</P>
<P>He was, as I have &s;aid, long a bringing it out, but when he had brought it out, he pur&s;ued it with &s;uch Impor|tunities, as wou'd admit of no Denial, <HI>at lea&s;t he intend|ed they &s;hou'd not;</HI> but I re&s;i&s;ted them ob&s;tinately, and yet with Expre&s;&s;ions of the utmo&s;t Kindne&s;s and Re&s;pect for him that cou'd be imagin'd; often telling him, there was nothing el&s;e in the World that I cou'd deny him, and &s;hewing him all the Re&s;pect, and upon all Occa&s;ions treating him with Intimacy and Freedom, as if he had been my Brother.</P>
<P>He tried all the Ways imaginable to bring his De&s;ign to pa&s;s, but I was inflexible; at la&s;t, he thought of a Way, which, he flatter'd him&s;elf, wou'd not fail; nor would he have been mi&s;taken perhaps, in any other Wo|man in the World, but me; this was, to try if he cou'd take me at an Advantage, and get to Bed to me, and then, <HI>as was mo&s;t rational to think,</HI> I &s;hould willing|ly enough marry him afterwards.</P>
<P>We were &s;o intimate together, that nothing but Man and Wi&s;e could, or at lea&s;t ought to be, more; but &s;till our Freedoms kept within the Bounds of Mode&s;ty and Decency: But one Evening, above all the re&s;t, we were very merry, and I fancy'd he pu&s;h'd the Mirth to watch for his Advantage; and I re&s;olved that I wou'd, at lea&s;t, feign to be as merry as he; and that, in &s;hort, if he offer'd any Thing, he &s;hould have his Will ea&s;ily enough.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="149">
About one a Clock in the Morning, for &s;o long we &s;at up together, I &s;aid, <HI>Come,</HI> 'tis one a Clock, <HI>I mu&s;t go to Bed; Well,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I'll go with you;</HI> No, No, &s;ays I, <HI>go to your own Chamber;</HI> he &s;aid he wou'd go to Bed with me: <HI>Nay,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>if you will,</HI> I don't know what to &s;ay; <HI>if I can't help it, you mu&s;t:</HI> However, I got from him, left him, and went into my Chamber, but did not &s;hut the Door, and as he cou'd ea&s;ily &s;ee that I was undre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf, he &s;teps to his own Room, which was but on the &s;ame Floor, and in a few Mi|nutes undre&s;&s;es him&s;elf al&s;o, and returns to my Door in his Gown and Slippers.</P>
<P>I thought he had been gone indeed, and &s;o that he had been in je&s;t; and by the Way, thought either he had no Mind to the Thing, or that he never intended it; &s;o I &s;hut my Door, that is, latch'd it, for I &s;eldom lock'd or bolted it, and went to Bed. I had not been in Bed a Minute, but he comes in his Gown, to the Door, and opens it a little Way, but not enough to come in, or look in, and &s;ays &s;oftly, What are you really gone to Bed? <HI>Yes, yes,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>get you gone:</HI> No indeed, &s;ays he, <HI>I &s;hall not begone, you gave me Leave before to come to Bed, and you &s;han't &s;ay get you gone now:</HI> So he comes into my Room, and then turns about, and fa&s;tens the Door, and immediately comes to the Bed-&s;ide to me: I pretended to &s;cold and &s;truggle, and bid him begone, with more Warmth than before; but it was all one; he had not a Rag of Cloaths on, but his Gown and Slippers, and Shirt, &s;o he throws off his Gown, and throws open the Bed, and came in at once.</P>
<P>I made a &s;eeming Re&s;i&s;tance, but it was no more in|deed; for, as above, I re&s;olv'd from the Beginning, he &s;hould ly with me if he wou'd, and for the re&s;t, I left it to come after.</P>
<P>Well, he lay with me that Night, and the two next, and very merry we were all the three Days between; but the third Night he began to be a little more grave: Now, my Dear, &s;ays he, tho' I have pu&s;h'd this Mat|ter farther than ever I intended; or than, I believe,
<PB N="152" REF="150">
you expected from me, who never made any Pretences to you but what were very hone&s;t; yet to heal it all up, and let you &s;ee how &s;incerely I meant at fir&s;t, and how hone&s;t I will ever be to you, I am ready to marry you &s;till, and de&s;ire you to let it be done to Morrow morn|ing; and I will give you the &s;ame fair Conditions of Marriage as I wou'd have done before.</P>
<P>This, it mu&s;t be own'd, was a Te&s;timony that he was very hone&s;t, and that he lov'd me &s;incerely; but I con&s;trued it quite another Way, namely, that he aim'd at the Money: But how &s;urpriz'd did he look! and how he was confounded, when he found me receive his Propo&s;al with Coldne&s;s and Indifference! and &s;till tell him, that it was the only Thing I cou'd not grant!</P>
<P>He was a&s;toni&s;h'd! What not take me now! &s;ays he, when I have been a-Bed with you! I an&s;wer'd coldly, tho' re&s;pectfully &s;till, <HI>It is true,</HI> to my Shame be it &s;poken, &s;ays I, <HI>that you have taken me by Surprize, and have had your Will of me; but I hope you will not take it ill that I cannot con&s;ent to marry, for all that; if I am with Child,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>Care mu&s;t be taken to manage that as you &s;hall direct; I hope you won't expo&s;e me, for my having expos'd my&s;elf to you, but I cannot go any far|ther;</HI> and at that Point I &s;tood, and wou'd hear of no Matrimony, by any Means.</P>
<P>Now becau&s;e this may &s;eem a little odd, I &s;hall &s;tate the Matter clearly, as I under&s;tood it my&s;elf. I knew that while I was a Mi&s;tre&s;s, it is cu&s;tomary for the Per|&s;on kept, to receive from them that keep; but if I &s;hould be a Wife, all I had then, was given up to the Husband, and I was thenceforth to be under his Au|thority only; and as I had Money enough, and need|ed not fear being what they call <HI>a ca&s;t-off Mi&s;tre&s;s,</HI> &s;o I had no need to give him twenty thou&s;and Pounds to mar|ry me, which had been buying my Lodging too dear a great deal.</P>
<P>Thus his Project of coming to Bed to me, was a Bite upon him&s;elf, while he intended it for a Bite upon me; and he was no nearer his Aim of marrying me, than he was before; all his Arguments he could urge
<PB N="153" REF="151">
upon the Subject of Matrimony, were at an End, for I po&s;itively declin'd marrying him; and as he had refus'd the thou&s;and Pi&s;toles which I had offer'd him in Com|pen&s;ation for his Expences and Lo&s;s, at <HI>Paris,</HI> with the <HI>Jew,</HI> and had done it upon the Hopes he had of mar|rying me; &s;o when he found his Way difficult &s;till, he was amaz'd, and I had &s;ome Rea&s;on to believe, repented that he had refus'd the Money.</P>
<P>But thus it is when Men run into wicked Mea&s;ures, to bring their De&s;igns about. I that was infinitely oblig'd to him before, began to talk to him, as if I had ballanc'd Accounts with him now; and that the Favour of Lying with a Whore was equal, not to the thou&s;and Pi&s;toles only, but to all the Debt I ow'd him, for &s;aving my Life, and all my Effects.</P>
<P>But he drew him&s;elf into it, and tho' it was a dear Bargain, yet it was a Bargain of his own making; he cou'd not &s;ay I had trick'd him into it; but as he pro|jected and drew me in to ly with him, depending that it was a &s;ure Game in order to a Marriage, &s;o I grant|ed him the Favour, as he call'd it, to ballance the Ac|count of Favours receiv'd from him, and keep the thou&s;and Pi&s;toles with a good Grace.</P>
<P>He was extreamly di&s;appointed in this Article, and knew not how to manage for a great while; and as I dare &s;ay, if he had not expected to have made it an Earne&s;t for marrying me, he would never have attempt|ed me the other Way; &s;o, I believ'd, if it had not been for the Money, which he knew I had, he would never have de&s;ir'd to marry me after he had lain with me: For, where is the Man that cares to marry a Whore, tho' of his own making? And as I knew him to be no Fool, &s;o I did him no Wrong, when I &s;uppos'd that, but for the Money, he wou'd not have had any Thoughts of me that Way; e&s;pecially after my yeilding as I had done; in which it is to be remember'd, that I made no Capitula|tion for marrying him, when I yielded to him, but let him do ju&s;t what he pleas'd, without any previous Bargain.</P>
<P>Well, hitherto we went upon Gue&s;&s;es at one ano|ther's De&s;igns; but as he continued to importune me to
<PB N="154" REF="152">
marry, tho' he had lain with me, and &s;till did ly with me as often as he pleas'd, and I continued to refu&s;e to mar|ry him, tho' I let him ly with me whenever he de&s;ir'd it; I &s;ay, as the&s;e two Circum&s;tances made up our Con|ver&s;ation, it cou'd not continue long thus, but we mu&s;t come to an Explanation.</P>
<P>One Morning, in the middle of our unlawful Free|doms, that is to &s;ay, when we were in Bed together; he &s;igh'd, and told me, he de&s;ir'd my Leave to ask me one Que&s;tion, and that I wou'd give him an An|&s;wer to it, with the &s;ame ingenuous Freedom and Ho|ne&s;ty, that I had us'd to treat him with: I told him I wou'd: Why then his Que&s;tion was, why I wou'd not marry him, &s;eeing I allow'd him all the Freedom of a Husband? <HI>Or, &s;ays he,</HI> my Dear, <HI>&s;ince you have been &s;o kind as to take me to your Bed, why will you not make me your own, and take me for good and all,</HI> that we may enjoy our&s;elves, <HI>without any Reproach to one another.</HI></P>
<P>I told him, that as I confe&s;s'd it was the only thing I cou'd not comply with him in, &s;o it was the only Thing in all my Actions, that I cou'd not give him a Rea&s;on for; that it was true, I had let him come to Bed to me, which was &s;uppos'd to be the greate&s;t Fa|vour a Woman could grant; but it was evident, and he might &s;ee it, that as I was &s;en&s;ible of the Obliga|tion I was under to him, for &s;aving me from the wor&s;t Circum&s;tance it was po&s;&s;ible for me to be brought to, I could deny him nothing; and if I had had any greater Favour to yield him, I &s;hou'd have done it, <HI>that of Matrimony only excepted,</HI> and he could not but &s;ee that I lov'd him to an extraordinary Degree, in every Part of my Behaviour to him; but that as to marrying, which was giving up my Liberty, it was what once he knew I had done, and he had &s;een how it had hurried me up and down in the World, and what it had ex|pos'd me to; that I had an Aver&s;ion to it, and de|&s;ir'd he wou'd not in&s;i&s;t upon it; he might ea&s;ily &s;ee I had no Aver&s;ion to him; and that if I was with Child by him, he &s;hou'd &s;ee a Te&s;timony of my Kindne&s;s to the Father, for that I would &s;ettle all I had in the World upon the Child.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="153">
He was mute a good while; at la&s;t, &s;ays he, Come, my Dear, you are the fir&s;t Woman in the World that ever lay with a Man, and then refus'd to marry him, and therefore there mu&s;t be &s;ome other Rea&s;on for your Refu&s;al; and I have therefore one other Reque&s;t, and that is, If I gue&s;s at the true Rea&s;on, and remove the Objection, will you then yield to me? I told him, if he remov'd the Objection, I mu&s;t need comply, for I &s;hou'd certainly do every Thing that I had no Objec|tion again&s;t.</P>
<P>Why then, my Dear, it mu&s;t be, that either you are already engag'd, and marry'd to &s;ome other Man, or you are not willing to di&s;po&s;e of your Money to me, and expect to advance your&s;elf higher with your For|tune. Now, if it be the fir&s;t of the&s;e, my Mouth will be &s;topp'd, and I have no more to &s;ay; but if it be the la&s;t, I am prepar'd effectually to remove the Objection, and an&s;wer all you can &s;ay on that Subject.</P>
<P>I took him up &s;hort at the fir&s;t of the&s;e; telling him, He mu&s;t have ba&s;e Thoughts of me indeed, to think that I could yield to him in &s;uch a Manner as I had done, and continue it with &s;o much Freedom, as he found I did, if I had a Husband, or were engag'd to any other Man; and that he might depend upon it, that was not my Ca&s;e, nor any Part of my Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Why then, &s;aid he, as to the other, I have an Of|fer to make to you, that &s;hall take off all the Objec|tion, <HI>viz.</HI> That I will not touch one Pi&s;tole of your E&s;tate, more, than &s;hall be with your own voluntary Con&s;ent, neither now, or at any other Time, but you &s;hall &s;ettle it as you plea&s;e for your Life, and upon who you plea&s;e after your Death; that I &s;hould &s;ee he was able to maintain me without it; and that it was not for that, that he follow'd me from <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>I was indeed &s;urpriz'd at that Part of his Offer, and he might ea&s;ily perceive it; it was not only what I did not expect, but it was what I knew not what An&s;wer to make to: He had indeed, remov'd my principal Objection, nay, all my Objections, and it was not po&s;&s;ible for me to give any An&s;wer; for if upon &s;o ge|nerous

an Offer I &s;hou'd agree with him, I then did as good as confe&s;s, that it was upon the Account of my Money that I refus'd him; and that though I cou'd give up my Virtue, and expo&s;e my&s;elf, yet I wou'd not give up my Money, which, tho' it was true, yet was really too gro&s;s for me to acknowledge, and I cou'd not pretend to marry him upon that Principle neither; then as to having him, and make over all my E&s;tate out of his Hands, &s;o as not to give him the Manage|ment of what I had, I thought it would be not only a little gothick and inhuman, but would be always a Foundation of Unkindne&s;s between us, and render us &s;u&s;pected one to another; &s;o that upon the whole, I was oblig'd to give a new Turn to it, and talk upon a kind of an elevated Strain, which really was not in my Thoughts at fir&s;t, at all; for I own, as above, the di|ve&s;ting my&s;elf of my E&s;tate, and putting my Money out of my Hand, was the Sum of the Matter, that made me refu&s;e to marry; but, I &s;ay, I gave it a new Turn upon this Occa&s;ion, as follows:</P>
<P>I told him, I had, perhaps, differing Notions of Matrimony, from what the receiv'd Cu&s;tom had given us of it; that I thought a Woman was a free Agent, as well as a Man, and was born free, and cou'd &s;he ma|nage her&s;elf &s;uitably, might enjoy that Liberty to as much Purpo&s;e as the Men do; that the Laws of Ma|trimony were indeed otherwi&s;e, and Mankind at this Time acted quite upon other Principles; and tho&s;e &s;uch, that a Woman gave her&s;elf entirely away from her&s;elf, in Marriage, and capitulated only to be, at be&s;t, but an upper Servant, and from the Time &s;he took the Man, &s;he was no better or wor&s;e than the Servant among the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> who had his Ears bor'd, that is, nail'd to the Door Po&s;t; who by that Act, gave him&s;elf up to be a Servant during Life.</P>
<P>That the very Nature of the Marriage Contract was, in &s;hort, nothing but giving up Liberty, E&s;tate, Au|thority, and every Thing, to the Man, and the Wo|man was indeed, a meer Woman ever after, that is to &s;ay, a Slave.</P>

<P>But he &s;hook his Head, and &s;aid, Where had I liv'd? and what dreadful Families had I liv'd among, that had frighted me into &s;uch terrible Apprehen&s;ions of Things? that the&s;e Things indeed, might happen where Men run into hazardous Things in Trade, and without Prudence, or due Con&s;ideration, launch'd their Fortunes in a Degree beyond their Strength, gra&s;ping at Adventures beyond their Stocks, and the like: but that, as he was &s;tated in the World, if I wou'd embark with him, he had a Fortune equal with mine; that together, we &s;hould have no Occa&s;ion of engaging in Bu&s;ine&s;s any more; but that in any Part of the World where I had a Mind to live, whether <HI>England, France, Holland,</HI> or where I would, we might &s;ettle, and live as happily as the World could make any one live; that if I de&s;ir'd the Management of our E&s;tate, when put together, if I wou'd not tru&s;t him with mine, he wou'd tru&s;t me with his; that we wou'd be upon one Bottom, and I &s;hou'd &s;teer: Ay, &s;ays I, you'll allow me to &s;teer, that is, hold the Helm, but you'll conn the Ship, <HI>as they call it;</HI> that is, as at Sea, a Boy &s;erves to &s;tand at the Helm, but he that gives him the Orders, is Pilot.</P>

<P>Well, he did not give it over yet, but came to the &s;erious Part, and there he thought he &s;hould be too ma|ny for me; he fir&s;t hinted, that Marriage was decreed by Heaven; that it was the fix'd State of Life, which God had appointed for Man's Felicity, and for e&s;ta|bli&s;hing a legal Po&s;terity; that there cou'd be no legal Claim of E&s;tates by Inheritance, but by Children born in Wedlock; that all the re&s;t was &s;unk under Scandal and Illegitimacy; and very well he talk'd upon that Subject, indeed.</P>
<P>But it wou'd not do; I took him &s;hort there; Look you, Sir, &s;aid I, you have an Advantage of me there indeed, in my particular Ca&s;e; but it wou'd not be ge|nerous to make u&s;e of it; I readily grant, that it were better for me to have marry'd you, than to admit you to the Liberty I have given you; but as I cou'd not reconcile my Judgment to Marriage, for the Rea&s;ons above, and had Kindne&s;s enough for you, and Obliga|tion too much on me, to re&s;i&s;t you, I &s;uffer'd your Rudene&s;s, and gave up my Virtue; but I have two Things before me to heal up that Breach of Honour, without that de&s;perate one of Marriage; and tho&s;e are, Repentance for what is pa&s;t, and putting an End to it for Time to come.</P>
<P>He &s;eem'd to be concern'd, to think that I &s;hou'd take him in that Manner; he a&s;&s;ured me that I mi&s;|under&s;tood him; that he had more Manners, as well

as more Kindne&s;s for me; and more Ju&s;tice than to re|proach me with what he had been the Aggre&s;&s;or in, and had &s;urpriz'd me into; that what he &s;poke, refer'd to my Words above, that the Woman, if &s;he thought fit, might entertain a Man, as the Man did a Mi&s;tre&s;s; and that I &s;eem'd to mention that Way of Living as ju&s;tify|able, and &s;etting it as a lawful Thing, and in the Place of Matrimony.</P>
<P>Well, we &s;trained &s;ome Compliments upon tho&s;e Points not worth repeating; and I added, I &s;uppo&s;ed when he got to Bed to me, he thought him&s;elf &s;ure of me; and indeed, in the ordinary Cour&s;e of Things, af|ter he had lain with me he ought to think &s;o; but that, upon the &s;ame Foot of Argument which I had di&s;cours'd with him upon, it was ju&s;t the contrary; and when a Woman had been weak enough to yield up the la&s;t Point before Wedlock, it would be adding one Weakne&s;s to another, to take the Man afterwards, to pin down the Shame of it upon her&s;elf all the Days of her Life, and bind her&s;elf to live all her Time with the only Man that could upbraid her with it; that in yielding at fir&s;t, &s;he mu&s;t be a Fool, but to take the Man, is to be &s;ure to be call'd a Fool; that to re&s;i&s;t a Man, is to act with Courage and Vigour, and to ca&s;t off the Reproach, which, in the Cour&s;e of Things, drops out of Know|ledge, and dies; the Man goes one Way, and the Wo|man another, as Fate, and the Circum&s;tances of Living direct; and if they keep one another's Council, the Folly is heard no more of; but to take the Man, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> is the mo&s;t prepo&s;terous Thing in Nature, and (&s;av|ing your Pre&s;ence) is to befoul one's &s;elf, and live al|ways in the Smell of it; <HI>No, no,</HI> added I, after a Man has lain with me, <HI>as a Mi&s;tre&s;s,</HI> he ought never to ly with me <HI>as a Wife;</HI> that's not only pre&s;erving the Crime in Memory, but it is recording it in the Family; if the Woman marries the Man afterwards, &s;he beats the Re|proach of it to the la&s;t Hour; if her Husband is not a Man of a hundred thou&s;and, he &s;ometime or other up|braids her with it; if he has Children, they fail not one Way or other to hear of it; if the Children are virtu|ous, they do their Mother the Ju&s;tice to hate her for it;

if they are wicked, they give her the Mortification of doing the like, and giving her for the Example. On the other Hand, if the Man and the Woman part, there is an End of the Crime, and an End of the Clamour; Time wears out the Memory of it; or a Woman may remove but a few Streets, and &s;he &s;oon out-lives it, and hears no more of it.</P>
<P>He was confounded at this Di&s;cour&s;e, and told me he could not &s;ay but that I was right in the Main; that as to that Part relating to managing E&s;tates, it was argu|ing <HI>a la Chavalier;</HI> it was in &s;ome Sen&s;e right, if the Women were able to carry it on &s;o, but that in general, the Sex were not capable of it; their Heads were not turned for it, and they had better chu&s;e a Per&s;on capable and hone&s;t, that knew how to do them Ju&s;tice, as Wo|men, as well as to love them; and that then the Trouble was all taken off of their Hands.</P>
<P>I told him it was a dear Way of purcha&s;ing their Ea&s;e; for very often when the Trouble was taken off of their Hands, &s;o was their Money too; and that I thought it was far &s;afer for the Sex not to be afraid of the Trouble, but to be really afraid of their Money; and that if no Body was tru&s;ted, no Body would be deceiv|ed; and the Staff in their own Hands, was the be&s;t Secu|rity in the World.</P>
<P>He reply'd that I had &s;tarted a new Thing in the World; that however I might &s;upport it by &s;ubtle Rea|&s;oning, yet it was a Way of arguing that was contrary to the general Practice, and that he confe&s;s'd he was much di&s;appointed in it; that had he known I would have made &s;uch an U&s;e of it, he would never have at|tempted what he did, which he had no wicked De&s;ign in, re&s;olving to make me Reparation, and that he was very &s;orry he had been &s;o unhappy; that he was very &s;ure he &s;hould never upbraid me with it hereafter, and had &s;o good an Opinion of me as to believe I did not &s;u&s;|pect him; but &s;eeing I was po&s;itive in refu&s;ing him, not|with&s;tanding what had pa&s;s'd, he had nothing to do but to &s;ecure me from Reproach, by going back again to <HI>Paris,</HI> that &s;o, according to my own Way of arguing,
<PB N="163" REF="161">
it might die out of Memory, and I might never meet with it again to my Di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>I was not plea&s;ed with this Part at all, for I had no Mind to let him go neither; and yet I had no Mind to give him &s;uch Hold of me as he would have had; and thus I was in a kind of Su&s;pen&s;e, irre&s;olute, and doubt|ful what Cour&s;e to take.</P>
<P>I was in the Hou&s;e with him, as I have ob&s;erved, and I &s;aw evidently that he was preparing to go back to <HI>Paris;</HI> and particularly, I found he was remitting Mo|ney to <HI>Paris,</HI> which was, as I under&s;tood afterwards, to pay for &s;ome Wines which he had given Order to have bought for him at <HI>Troyes</HI> in <HI>Champagne;</HI> and I knew not what cour&s;e to take; and be&s;ides that, I was very loth to part with him; I found al&s;o that I was with Child by him, which was what I had not yet told him of; and &s;ometimes I thought not to tell him of it at all; but I was in a &s;trange Place, and had no Acquaintance, tho' I had a great deal of Sub&s;tance, which, indeed, having no Friends there, was the more dangerous to me.</P>
<P>This obliged me to take him one Morning, when I &s;aw him, as I thought, a little anxious about his going, and irre&s;olute; <HI>&s;ays I</HI> to him, <HI>I fancy you can hardly find in your Heart to leave me now.</HI> The more <HI>unkind is it in you,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>&s;everely unkind, to refu&s;e a Man that knows not how to part with you.</HI></P>
<P>I am &s;o far from being unkind to you, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> that I will go over all the World with you, if you de&s;ir'd me, except to <HI>Paris,</HI> where you know I can't go.</P>
<P>It is Pity &s;o much Love, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> on both Sides &s;hould ever &s;eparate.</P>
<P>Why then, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> do you go away from me?</P>
<P>Becau&s;e, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> you won't take me.</P>
<P>But if I won't take you, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> you may take me any where, but to <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>He was very loth to go any where, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> without me; but he mu&s;t go to <HI>Paris,</HI> or to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI></P>
<P>I told him I did not u&s;e to court, but I dur&s;t venture my&s;elf to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> with him, if there was a Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of his going.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="162">
He told me, God be thank'd, he was in no Nece&s;&s;ity of going any where, but that he had a tempting Invi|tation to go to the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>I an&s;wer'd, I would &s;ay nothing to that; but that I de&s;ired he would go any where but to <HI>Paris;</HI> becau&s;e there he knew I mu&s;t not go.</P>
<P>He &s;aid he had no Remedy, but to go where I could not go; for he could not bear to &s;ee me, if he mu&s;t not have me.</P>
<P>I told him, that was the unkinde&s;t Thing he could &s;ay of me, and that I ought to take it very ill, &s;eeing I knew how very well to oblige him to &s;tay, without yielding to what he knew I could not yield to.</P>
<P>This amazed him, and he told me I was plea&s;ed to be my&s;terious; but, that he was &s;ure it was in no Body's Power to hinder him going, if he re&s;olv'd upon it, ex|cept me; who had Influence enough upon him to make him do any Thing.</P>
<P>Yes, <HI>I told him,</HI> I could hinder him, becau&s;e I knew he could no more do an unkind Thing by me than he could do an unju&s;t one; and to put him out of his Pain, I told him I was with Child.</P>
<P>He came to me, and taking me in his Arms, and ki&s;&s;ing me a thou&s;and Times almo&s;t, &s;aid, Why would I be &s;o unkind, not tell him that before?</P>
<P>I told him, <HI>'twas hard,</HI> that to have him &s;tay, I &s;hould be forc'd to do as Criminals do to avoid the Gal|lows, <HI>plead my Belly;</HI> and that I thought I had given him Te&s;timonies enough of an Affection equal to that of a Wife, if I had not only lain with him, been with Child by him, &s;hewn my&s;elf unwilling to part with him, but offer'd to go to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> with him; and ex|cept one Thing that I could not grant, what could he ask more?</P>
<P>He &s;tood mute a good while, but afterwards told me, he had a great deal more to &s;ay, if I could a&s;&s;ure him, that I would not take ill whatever Freedom he might u&s;e with me in his Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>I told him that he might u&s;e any Freedom in Words with me; for a Woman who had given Leave to &s;uch
<PB N="165" REF="163">
other Freedoms, as I had done, had left her&s;elf no Room $o take any Thing ill, let it be what it would.</P>
<P>Why then, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> I hope you believe, Madam, I was born a Chri&s;tian, and that I have &s;ome Sen&s;e of &s;a|$red Things upon my Mind; when I fir&s;t broke in up|on my own Virtue, and a&s;&s;aulted yours; when I &s;ur|prized, and, as it were, forc'd you to that which nei|ther you intended, or I de&s;ign'd but a few Hours before, $t was upon a Pre&s;umption that you would certainly mar|$y me, if once I could go that Length with you; and it was with an hone&s;t Re&s;olution to make you my Wife.</P>
<P>But I have been &s;urprized with &s;uch a Denial, that $o Woman in &s;uch Circum&s;tances ever gave to a Man; for certainly it was never known that any Woman re|fu&s;ed to marry a Man that had fir&s;t lain with her, much $e&s;s a Man that had gotten her with $Span$ $pon different Notions from all the $Span$ $ou rea&s;on upon it &s;o &s;trongly, that a Man $Span$ $y what to an&s;wer, yet I mu&s;t own, there is $Span$ it &s;hocking to Nature, and &s;omething very $Span$ your&s;elf; but above all, it is unkind to the $Span$ $et unborn; who, if we marry, will come into the World with Advantage enough, but if not, is ruined be|fore it is born; mu&s;t bear the eternal Reproach of what $t is not guilty of; mu&s;t be branded from its Cradle with a Mark of Infamy; be loaded with the Crimes and Follies of its Parents, and &s;uffer for Sins that it never committed: This I take to be very hard, and indeed cruel to the poor Infant not yet born, who you cannot think of with any Patience, if you have the common Affection of a Mother, and not do that for it, which $hould at once place it on a Level with the re&s;t of the World, and not leave it to cur&s;e its Parents for what al|&s;o we ought to be a&s;ham'd of: I cannot therefore, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> $at beg and intreat you, as you are a Chri&s;tian, and a $$other, not to let the innocent Lamb you go with be ruined before it is born, and leave it to cur&s;e and $eproach us hereafter, for what may be &s;o ea&s;ily a|voided.</P>

<P>If ever any Man in the World was truly valuable for the &s;tricte&s;t Hone&s;ty of Intention, <HI>this was the Man;</HI> and if ever a Woman in her Sen&s;es rejected a Man of Merit on &s;o trivial and frivolous a Pretence, <HI>I was the Woman;</HI> but &s;urely it was the mo&s;t prepo&s;terous Thing that ever Woman did.</P>
<P>He would have taken me as a Wife, but would not en|tertain me as a Whore; was ever Woman angry with any Gentleman on that Head? and was ever Woman &s;o &s;tu|pid to chu&s;e to be a Whore, where &s;he might have been an hone&s;t Wife?

<P>I &s;aw he &s;poke this with a di&s;turb'd Mind, and that $t was with &s;ome Difficulty that he re&s;trained his Pa&s;|&s;ion; &s;o I declin'd any farther Di&s;cour&s;e upon it; only &s;aid, I hop'd he would con&s;ider of it: <HI>O Madam,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>do not bid me con&s;ider,</HI> 'tis <HI>for you to con&s;ider;</HI> and with that he went out of the Room, in a &s;trange kind of Confu&s;ion, as was ea&s;y to be &s;een in his Counte|nance.</P>
<P>If I had not been one of the fooli&s;he&s;t as well as wickede&s;t Creatures upon Earth, I could never have $cted thus. I had one of the hone&s;te&s;t compleate&s;t Gen|tlemen upon Earth, at my Hand; he had in one Sen&s;e $av'd my Life, but had &s;av'd that Life from Ruin in a mo&s;t remarkable Manner; he lov'd me even to De&s;trac|tion, and had come from <HI>Paris</HI> to <HI>Rotterdam</HI> on Pur|po&s;e to &s;eek me; he had offer'd me Marriage, even
<PB N="168" REF="166">
after I was with Child by him, and had offered to quit all his Preten&s;ions to my E&s;tate, and give it up to my own Management, having a plentiful E&s;tate of his own: Here I might have &s;ettled my&s;elf out of the Reach even of Di&s;a&s;ter it&s;elf; his E&s;tate and mine would have purcha&s;ed even then above two thou&s;and Pounds a Year, and I might have liv'd like a Queen, nay, far more happy than a Queen; and which was above all, I had now an Opportunity to have quitted a Life of Crime and De|bauchery, which I had been given up to for &s;everal Years, and to have &s;at down quiet in Plenty and Ho|nour, and to have &s;et my&s;elf apart to the Great Work, which I have &s;ince &s;een &s;o much Nece&s;&s;ity of, and Oc|ca&s;ion for; I mean that of Repentance.</P>
<P>But my Mea&s;ure of Wickedne&s;s was not yet full; I continued ob&s;tinate again&s;t Matrimony, and yet I could not bear the Thoughts of his going away neither. As to the Child I was not very anxious about it; I told him, I would promi&s;e him that it &s;hould never come to him to upbraid him with its being illegitimate; that if it was a Boy I would breed it up like the Son of a Gentleman, and u&s;e it well for his Sake; and after a little more &s;uch Talk as this, and &s;eeing him re&s;olved to go, I retir'd, but could not help letting him &s;ee the Tears run down my Cheeks; he came to me, and ki&s;s'd me, entreated me, conjur'd me by the Kindne&s;s he had &s;hewn me in my Di&s;tre&s;s; by the Ju&s;tice had done me in my Bills and Money-affairs; by the Re&s;pect which made him refu&s;e a thou&s;and Pi&s;toles from me for his Expences with that Traytor, the <HI>Jew;</HI> by the Pledge of our Misfortunes, <HI>&s;o he call'd it,</HI> which I carry'd with me; and by all the &s;incere&s;t Affection could propo&s;e to do, that I would not drive him away.</P>
<P>But it would not; I was &s;tupid and &s;en&s;ele&s;s, deaf to all his Importunities, and continued &s;o to the la&s;t; &s;o we parted, only de&s;iring me to promi&s;e that I would write him Word when I was delivered, and how he might give me an An&s;wer; and this I engaged my Word I would do; and upon his de&s;iring to be inform'd which Way I intended to di&s;po&s;e of my&s;elf, I told him I re|&s;olved to go directly to <HI>England,</HI> and to <HI>London,</HI> where
<PB N="169" REF="167">
I propo&s;ed to ly in; but &s;ince he re&s;olved to leave me, I told him I &s;uppo&s;ed it would be of no Con&s;equence to him, what became of me.</P>
<P>He lay in his Lodgings that Night, but went away early in the Morning, leaving me a Letter, in which he repeated all he had &s;aid; recommended the Care of the Child, and de&s;ired of me that as he had remitted to me the Offer of a thou&s;and Pi&s;toles, which I would have given him for the Recompen&s;e of his Charges and Trouble with the <HI>Jew,</HI> and had given it me back; &s;o he de&s;ir'd I would allow him to oblige me to &s;et a|part that thou&s;and Pi&s;toles with its Improvement for the Child, and for its Education; earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ing me to &s;ecure that little Portion for the abandon'd Orphan, when I &s;hould think fit, <HI>as he was &s;ure I wou'd,</HI> to throw away the re&s;t upon &s;omething as worthle&s;s as my &s;incere Friend at <HI>Paris;</HI> he concluded with moving me to reflect with the &s;ame Regret as he did, on our Follies we had committed together; ask'd me Forgivene&s;s for being the Aggre&s;&s;or in the Fact; and forgave me every Thing, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> but the Cruelty of refu&s;ing him, which be own'd he could not forgive me &s;o heartily as he &s;hou'd do, becau&s;e he was &s;atisfied it was an Injury to my&s;elf, would be an Introduction to my Ruin, and that I would &s;eriou&s;ly repent of it; he foretold &s;ome fatal Things, which, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> he was well a&s;&s;ured I &s;hould fall into; and that, at la&s;t I &s;hould be ruined by a bad Husband; bid me be the more wary, that I might render him a fal&s;e Prophet; but to remember, that if ever I came in|to Di&s;tre&s;s, I had a fa&s;t Friend at <HI>Paris,</HI> who would not upbraid me with the unkind Things pa&s;t, but would be always ready to return me Good for Evil.</P>
<P>This Letter &s;tunn'd me, I could not think it po&s;&s;ible for any one, that had not dealt with the Devil, to write &s;uch a Letter; for he &s;poke of &s;ome particular Things which afterwards were to befal me, with &s;uch an A&s;&s;u|rance, that it frighted me before-hand; and when tho&s;e Things did come to pa&s;s, I was per&s;waded he had &s;ome more than human Knowledge; in a Word, his Advices to me to repent, were very affectionate; his Warnings of Evil to happen to me, were very kind; and his Pro|mi&s;es

of A&s;&s;i&s;tance, if I wanted him, were &s;o generous, that I have &s;eldom &s;een the like; and tho' I did not at fir&s;t &s;et much by that Part, becau&s;e I look'd upon them as what might not happen, and as what was improbable to happen at that Time; yet all the re&s;t of his Letter was &s;o moving, that it left me very melancholly, and I cry'd four and twenty Hours after almo&s;t without cea&s;ing about it; and yet even all this while, whatever it was that bewitch'd me, I had not one &s;erious Wi&s;h that I had taken him; I wi&s;h'd heartily indeed that I could have kept him with me, but I had a mortal Aver|&s;ion to marrying him, or indeed, any Body el&s;e; but form'd a thou&s;and wild Notions in my Head, that I was yet gay enough, and young and hand&s;ome enough to plea&s;e a Man of Quality; and that I would try my Fortune at <HI>London,</HI> come of it what would.</P>
<P>Thus blinded by my own Vanity, I threw away the only Opportunity I then had, to have effectually &s;ettled my Fortunes, and &s;ecur'd them for this World; and I am a Memorial to all that &s;hall read my Story, a &s;tand|ing Monument of the Madne&s;s and Di&s;traction which Pride and Infatuations from Hell runs us into, how $ll our Pa&s;&s;ions guide us, and how dangerou&s;ly we act, when we follow the Dictates of an ambitious Mind.</P>
<P>I was rich, beautiful and agreeable, and not yet old; I had known &s;omething of the Influence I had had up|on the Fancies of Men, even of the highe&s;t Rank; I never forgot that the Prince <HI>de&mdash;</HI>had &s;aid with an Exta&s;y, that I was the fine&s;t Woman in <HI>France.</HI> I knew I could make a Figure at <HI>London,</HI> and how well I could grace that Figure. I was not at a Lo&s;s how to behave, and having already been ador'd by Princes, I thought of nothing le&s;s than of being Mi&s;tre&s;s to the King him&s;elf: But I go back to my immediate Circum&s;tances at that Time.</P>
<P>I got over the Ab&s;ence of my hone&s;t Merchant but &s;lowly at fir&s;t; it was with infinite Regret that I let him go at all; and when I read the Letter he left, I was quite confounded; as &s;oon as he was out of Call, and irrecoverable, I would have given half I had in the World for him back again; my Notions of Things
<PB N="171" REF="169">
chang'd in an In&s;tant, and I called my&s;elf a thou&s;and Fools, for ca&s;ting my&s;elf upon a Life of Scandal and Hazard; when after the Shipwreck of Virtue, Honour and Principle, and &s;ailing at the utmo&s;t Ri&s;que in the &s;tormy Seas of Crime, and abominable Levity, I had a &s;afe Harbour pre&s;ented, and no Heart to ca&s;t Anchor in it.</P>
<P>His Predictions terrify'd me, his Promi&s;es of Kind|ne&s;s if I came to Di&s;tre&s;s, melted me into Tears, but frighted me with the Apprehen&s;ions of ever coming into &s;uch Di&s;tre&s;s, and fill'd my Head with a thou&s;and Anxi|eties and Thoughts, how it &s;hould be po&s;&s;ible for me, who had now &s;uch a Fortune, to &s;ink again into Mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Then the dreadful Scene of my Life, when I was left with my five Children, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as I have related, repre|&s;ented it&s;elf again to me, and I &s;at con&s;idering what Mea&s;ures I might take to bring my&s;elf to &s;uch a State of De&s;olation again, and how I &s;hould act to avoid it.</P>
<P>But the&s;e Things wore off gradually; as to my Friend, the Merchant, he was gone, and gone irrecoverably, for I dur&s;t not follow him to <HI>Paris,</HI> for the Rea&s;ons mentioned above; again, I was afraid to write to him to return, le&s;t he &s;hould have refu&s;ed, as I verily be|liev'd he would; &s;o I &s;at and cry'd intollerably for &s;ome Weeks; but I &s;ay, it wore off gradually; and as I had a pretty deal of Bu&s;ine&s;s for managing my Effects, the Hurry of that particular Part &s;erv'd to divert my Thoughts, and in Part to wear out the Impre&s;&s;ions which had been made upon my Mind.</P>
<P>I had &s;old my Jewels, all but the fine Diamond Ring, which my Gentleman the Jeweller, us'd to wear, and this, at proper Times, I wore my&s;elf; as al&s;o the Dia|mond Necklace, which the Prince had given me, and a Pair of extraordinary Ear-rings worth about 600 Pi|&s;toles; the other, which was a fine Casket, he left with me at his going to <HI>Ver&s;ailles,,</HI> and a &s;mall Ca&s;e with &s;ome Rubies and Emeralds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I &s;ay, I &s;old them at the <HI>Hague</HI> for 7600 Pi&s;toles; I had received all the Bills which the Merchant had help'd me to at <HI>Paris,</HI> and
<PB N="172" REF="170">
with the Money I brought with me, they made up 13900 Pi&s;toles more; &s;o that I had in Ready-money, and in Account in the Bank of <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> above one and twen|ty thou&s;and Pi&s;toles, be&s;ides Jewels; and how to get this Trea&s;ure to <HI>England</HI> was my next Care.</P>
<P>The Bu&s;ine&s;s I had had now with a great many Peo|ple, for receiving &s;uch large Sums, and &s;elling Jewels of &s;uch con&s;iderable Value, gave me Opportunity to know and conver&s;e with &s;everal of the be&s;t Merchants of the Place; &s;o that I wanted no Direction now how to get my Money remitted to <HI>England;</HI> applying therefore to &s;everal Merchants, that I might neither ri&s;que it all on the Credit of one Merchant, nor &s;uffer any &s;ingle Man to know the Quantity of Money I had; I &s;ay, ap|plying my&s;elf to &s;everal Merchants I got Bills of Ex|change payable at <HI>London</HI> for all my Money; the fir&s;t Bills I took with me, the &s;econd Bills I left in Tru&s;t, (in Ca&s;e of any Di&s;a&s;ter at Sea) in the Hands of the fir&s;t Merchant, him to whom I was recommended by my Friend from <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus &s;pent nine Months in <HI>Holland,</HI> refu&s;ed the be&s;t Offer ever Woman in my Circum&s;tances had, parted unkindly, and indeed barbarou&s;ly with the be&s;t Friend, and hone&s;te&s;t Man in the World, got all my Money in my Pocket, and a Ba&s;tard in my Belly, I took Shipping at the <HI>Briel</HI> in the Packet-boat, and arrived &s;afe at <HI>Harwich,</HI> where my Woman <HI>Amy</HI> was come, by my Direction, to meet me.</P>
<P>I would willingly have given ten thou&s;and Pounds of my Money to have been rid of the Burthen I had in my Belly, as above; but it could not be, &s;o I was obliged to bear with that Part, and get rid of it by the ordina|ry Method of Patience, and a hard Travel.</P>
<P>I was above the contemptible U&s;age that Women in my Circum&s;tances oftentimes meet with. I had con&s;i|dered all that fully; and having &s;ent <HI>Amy</HI> before|hand, and remitted her Money to do it, &s;he had taken me a very hand&s;ome Hou&s;e in<HI>&mdash;Street,</HI> ne$r <HI>Charing-Cro&s;s;</HI> had hir'd me two Maids and a Foot|man, whom &s;he had put in a good Livery; and having hir'd a Gla&s;s-Coach and four Hor&s;es, &s;he came with them
<PB N="173" REF="171">
and the Man-Servant to <HI>Harwich</HI> to meet me, and had been there near a Week before I came; &s;o I had no|thing to do but to go away to <HI>London</HI> to my own Hou&s;e, where I arriv'd in very good Health, and pa&s;s'd for a <HI>French</HI> Lady, by the Title of&mdash;.</P>
<P>My fir&s;t Bu&s;ine&s;s was, to get all my Bills accepted; which, to cut the Story &s;hort, were all both accepted, and currently paid; and I then re&s;olv'd to take me a Country-Lodging &s;omewhere near the Town, to be <HI>In|cognito,</HI> till I was brought to Bed; which, appearing in &s;uch a Figure, and having &s;uch an Equipage, I ea&s;ily manag'd without any Body's offering the u&s;ual In&s;ults of Pari&s;h-Enquiries. I did not appear in my new Hou&s;e for &s;ome Time; and afterwards I thought fit, for par|ticular Rea&s;ons to quit that Hou&s;e, and not come to it at all, but take hand&s;ome large Apartments in the <HI>Pall|mall,</HI> in a Hou&s;e, out of which was a private Door into the King's Garden, by Permi&s;&s;ion of the chief Garden|er, who had liv'd in the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I had now all my Effects &s;ecur'd; but my Money be|ing my great Concern at that Time, I found it a Dif|ficulty how to di&s;po&s;e of it, &s;o as to bring me in an an|nual Intere&s;t; however, in &s;ome Time I got a &s;ub&s;tan|tial &s;afe Mortgage for 14000 <HI>l.</HI> by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the famous Sir <HI>Robert Clayton,</HI> for which I had an E&s;|tate of 1800 Pounds a Year bound to me; and had 700 Pounds per <HI>Annum</HI> Intere&s;t for it.</P>
<P>This, with &s;ome other Securities, made me a very hand&s;ome E&s;tate of above a thou&s;and Pounds a Year; enough, one would think, to keep any Woman in <HI>Eng|land</HI> from being a Whore.</P>
<P>I lay in at&mdash;, about four Miles from <HI>London,</HI> and brought a fine Boy into the World; and according to my Promi&s;e, &s;ent an Account of it to my Friend at <HI>Paris,</HI> the Father of it; and in the Letter told him how &s;orry I was for his going away, and did as good as intimate that if he would come once more to &s;ee me I &s;hould u&s;e him better than I had gone. He gave me a very kind and obliging An&s;wer, but took not the lea&s;t Notice of what I had &s;aid <HI>of his coming over,</HI> &s;o I found
<PB N="174" REF="172">
my Intere&s;t lo&s;t there for ever. He gave me Joy of the Child, and hinted that he hop'd I would make good what he had begg'd for the poor Infant, as I had pro|mi&s;ed; and I &s;ent him Word again that I would &s;end his Order to a Title; and &s;uch a Fool, and &s;o weak I was in this la&s;t Letter, notwith&s;tanding what I have &s;aid of his not taking Notice of my Invitation, as to a$k his Pardon almo&s;t for the U&s;age I gave him at <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> and &s;toop'd &s;o low as to expo&s;tulate with him for not taking Notice of my inviting him to come to me again, as I had done; and which was &s;till more, went &s;o far as to make a &s;econd Sort of an Offer to him, telling him almo&s;t in plain Words that if he would come over now I would have him; but he never gave me the lea&s;t Reply to it at all, which was as ab&s;olute a Denial to me as he was ever able to give; &s;o I &s;at down, I cannot &s;ay contented, but vex'd heartily that I had made the Offer at all, for he had, as I may &s;ay, his full Revenge of me, in &s;corning to an&s;wer, and to let me twice ask that of him, which he with &s;o much Importunity begg'd of me before.</P>
<P>I was now up again, and &s;oon came to my City Lodg|ing in the <HI>Pall-mall,</HI> and here I began to make a Fi|gure &s;uitable to my E&s;tate, which was very great; and and I &s;hall give you an Account of my Equipage in a few Words, and of my&s;elf too.</P>
<P>I paid 60 <HI>l.</HI> a Year for my new Apartments, for I took them by the Year, but then they were hand&s;ome Lodgings indeed, and very richly furni&s;hed. I kept my own Servants to clean and look after them, found my own Kitchen-ware and Firing; my Equipage was hand|&s;ome but not very large; I had a Coach, a Coachman, a Footman, my Woman <HI>Amy,</HI> whom I now dre&s;s'd like a Gentlewoman, and made her my Companion, and three Maids, and thus I liv'd for a Time. I dre&s;s'd to the Height of every Mode, went extremely rich in Cloaths, and as for Jewels, I wanted none; I gave a very good Livery lac'd with Silver, and as rich as any Body below the Nobility could be &s;een with; and thus I appeared, leaving the World to gue&s;s who or what I was, without offering to put my&s;elf forward.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="173">
I walk'd &s;ometimes in the <HI>Mall</HI> with my Woman <HI>A|my,</HI> but I kept no Company, and made no Acquaint|ances, only made as gay a Shew as I was able to do, and that upon all Occa&s;ions; I found however the World was not altogether &s;o unconcern'd about me as I &s;eem'd to be about them; and fir&s;t I under&s;tood that the Neighbours began to be mighty inqui&s;itive about me; as who I was? and what my Circum&s;tances were?</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was the only Per&s;on that could an&s;wer their Cu|rio&s;ity, or give any Account of me, and &s;he a tatling Wom$n and a true Go&s;&s;ip, took Care to do that with all the Art that &s;he was Mi&s;tre&s;s of; &s;he let them know that I was the Widow of a Per&s;on of Quality in <HI>France,</HI> that I was very rich, that I came over hither to look af|ter an E&s;tate that fell to me by &s;ome of my Relations who died here, that I was worth 40000 <HI>l.</HI> all in my own Hands, <HI>and the like.</HI></P>
<P>This was all wrong in <HI>Amy,</HI> and in me too, tho' we did not &s;ee it at fir&s;t, for this recommended me indeed to tho&s;e Sort of Gentlemen they call <HI>Fortune-hunters,</HI> and who always be&s;ieg'd Ladies, <HI>as they call it,</HI> on Pur|po&s;e to take them Pri&s;oners, <HI>as I called it,</HI> that is to &s;ay, to marry the Women, and have the &s;pending of their Money. But if I was wrong in refu&s;ing the honourable Propo&s;als of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant, who offered me the Di&s;po&s;al of my whole E&s;tate, and had as much of his own to maintain me with; I was right now in refu&s;ing tho&s;e Offers which came generally from Gentlemen of good Families and good E&s;tates, but who living to the Extent of them, were always needy and nece&s;&s;itous, and want|ed a Sum of Money to make them&s;elves ea&s;y, <HI>as they call it,</HI> that is to &s;ay, to pay off Incumbrances, Si&s;ters Portions, <HI>and the like;</HI> and then the Woman is Pri&s;oner for Life, and may live as they plea&s;e to give her Leave. This Life I had &s;een into clearly enough, and therefore $ was not to be catch'd that Way; however, as I &s;aid, the Reputation of my Money brought &s;everal of tho&s;e Sort of Gentry about me, and they found Means, by one Stratagem or other, to get Acce&s;s to my Lady&s;hip; but, in &s;hort, I an&s;wered them all well enough; <HI>that I $ved &s;ingle, and was happy;</HI> that <HI>as I had no Occa&s;ion</HI>

<P>As I have mentioned Sir <HI>Robert Clayton,</HI> with whom I had the good Fortune to become acquainted, on Ac|count of the Mortgage which he help'd me to, it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to take Notice, that I had much Advantage in my ordinary Affairs, by his Advice, and therefore I cal|led it my good Fortune; for as he paid me &s;o con&s;idera|ble an annual Income as 700 <HI>l.</HI> a Year, &s;o I am to ac|knowledge my&s;elf much a Debtor, not only to the Ju&s;|tice of his Dealings with me, but to the Prudence and Conduct which he guided me to, by his Advice, for the Management of my E&s;tate; and as he found I was not inclin'd to marry, he frequently took Occa&s;ion to hint how &s;oon I might rai&s;e my Fortune to a prodigious Height, if I would but order my Family-Oeconomy &s;o far within my Revenue as to lay up every Year &s;ome|thing to add to the Capital.</P>
<P>I was convinc'd of the Truth of what he &s;aid, and a|greed to the Advantages of it; you are to take it as you go, that Sir <HI>Robert</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed by my own Di&s;cour&s;e, and e&s;pecially by my Woman <HI>Amy,</HI> that I had 2000 <HI>l.</HI> a Year Income; he judged, as he &s;aid, by my Way of Living, that I could not &s;pend above one thou&s;and; and &s;o, he added, I might prudently lay by 1000 <HI>l.</HI> every Year to add to the Capital; and by adding every Year the ad|ditional Intere&s;t or Income of the Money to the Capital, he prov'd to me, that in ten Years I &s;hould double the 1000 <HI>l.</HI> per <HI>Annum,</HI> that I laid by; and he drew me out a Table, as he call'd it, of the Increa&s;e for me to judge by; and by which, he &s;aid, if the Gentlemen of <HI>Eng|land</HI> would but act &s;o, every Family of them would en|crea&s;e their Fortunes to a great Degree, ju&s;t as Merchants

<P>As Sir <HI>Robert</HI> frequently vi&s;ited me, and was (if I may &s;ay &s;o from his own Mouth) very well plea&s;ed with my Way of conver&s;ing with him, for he knew nothing, nor &s;o much as gue&s;s'd at what I had been; I &s;ay, as he came often to &s;ee me, &s;o he always entertained me with this Scheme of Frugality; and one Time he brought another Paper, wherein he &s;hew'd me much to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e as the former, to what Degree I &s;hould encrea&s;e my E&s;tate, if I would come into his Method of contract|ing my Expences; and by this Scheme of his, it ap|peared, that laying up a thou&s;and Pounds a Year, and every Year adding the Intere&s;t to it, I &s;hould in twelve Years Time have in Bank one and twenty thou&s;and, and fifty eight Pounds, after which I might lay up two thou|&s;and Pounds a Year.</P>
<P>I objected that I was a young Woman, that I had been $$'d to live plentifully, and with a good Appearance, and that I knew not how to be a Mi&s;er.</P>
<P>He told me that if I thought I had enough, it was well; but if I de&s;ir'd to have more, this was the Way, that in another twelve Years, I &s;hould be too rich, &s;o that I &s;hould not know what to do with it.</P>
<P>Ay Sir, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> you are contriving how to make me $Span$ old Woman, but that won't an&s;wer my End; I had rather have 20000 <HI>l.</HI> now than 60000 <HI>l.</HI> when I am fifty Years old.</P>
<P><HI>Then, Madam,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I &s;uppo&s;e your Honour has no Children?</HI></P>
<P><HI>None, Sir</HI> Robert, &s;aid I, <HI>but what are provided for:</HI> &s;o I left him in the dark, as much as I found him. How|ever, I con&s;ider'd his Scheme very well, tho' I &s;aid no more to him at that Time, and I re&s;olved, tho' I would make a very good Figure, I &s;ay, I re&s;olved to abate a $iule of my Expence, and draw in, live clo&s;er, and &s;ave $omething, if not &s;o much as he propos'd to me. It was near the End of the Year that Sir <HI>Robert</HI> made this
<PB N="178" REF="176">
Propo&s;al to me, and when the Year was up, I went to his Hou&s;e in the City, and there I told him, I came to thank him for his Scheme of Frugality; that I had been &s;tudying much upon it; and tho' I had not been able to mortify my&s;elf &s;o much as to lay up a thou&s;and Pounds a Year: yet, as I had not come to him for my Intere&s;t half yearly, as was u&s;ual, I was now come to let him know, that I had re&s;olv'd to lay up that &s;even hundred Pounds a Year, and, never u&s;e a Penny of it, de&s;iring him to help me to put it out to Advantage.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Robert,</HI> a Man thorowly vers'd in Arts of impro|ving Money, but thorowly hone&s;t, &s;aid to me, Madam, I am glad you approve of the Method that I propos'd to you; but you have begun wrong; you &s;hou'd have come for your Intere&s;t at the half Year, and then you had had the Money to put out; now you have lo&s;t half a Year's Intere&s;t of 350 <HI>l.</HI> which is 9 <HI>l.</HI> for I had but 5 <HI>per Cent.</HI> on the Mortgage.</P>
<P>Well, well, Sir, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> can you put this out for me now?</P>
<P>Let it lie, Madam, &s;ays he, till the next Year, and then I'll put out your 1400 <HI>l.</HI> together, and in the mean Time I'll pay you Intere&s;t for the <HI>700 l</HI> &s;o he gave me his Bill for the Money which he told me &s;hould be no le&s;s than 6 <HI>l. per Cent.</HI> Sir <HI>Robert Clayton</HI>'s Bill was what no body wou'd refu&s;e; &s;o I thank'd him, and let it lie; and next Year I did the &s;ame, and the third Year Sir <HI>Robert</HI> got me a good Mortga$e for 2200 <HI>l.</HI> at 6 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Intere&s;t: So I had 132 <HI>l.</HI> a Year added to my Income, which was a very &s;atisfying Article.</P>
<P>But I return to my Hi&s;tory: As I have &s;aid, I found that my Mea&s;ures were all wrong, the Po&s;ture I &s;et up in, expos'd me to innumerable Vi&s;iters of the Kind I have mention'd above; I was cry'd up for a va&s;t For|tune, and one that Sir <HI>Robert Clayton</HI> manag'd for; and Sir <HI>Robert Clayton</HI> was courted for me, as much as I was for my&s;elf: But I had given Sir <HI>Robert</HI> his Cue; I had told him my Opinion of Matrimony, in ju&s;t the &s;ame Terms as I had done my Merchant, and he came
<PB N="179" REF="177">
into it pre&s;ently; he own'd that my Ob&s;ervation was ju&s;t, and that if I valued my Liberty, as I knew my Fortune, and that it was in my own Hands, I was to blame, if I gave it away to any one.</P>
<P>But Sir <HI>Robert</HI> knew nothing of my De&s;ign; that I aim'd at being a kept Mi&s;tre&s;s, and to have a hand&s;ome Maintenance; and that I was &s;till for getting Money, and laying it up too, as much as he cou'd de&s;ire me, only by a wor&s;e Way.</P>
<P>However, Sir <HI>Robert</HI> came &s;eriou&s;ly to me one Day, and told me, he had an Offer of Matrimony to make to me, that was beyond all that he had heard had of|fer'd them&s;elves, and this was a Merchant; Sir <HI>Robert</HI> and I agreed exactly in our Notions of a Merchant: Sir <HI>Robert</HI> &s;aid, and I found it to be true, that a true b$ed Merchant is the be&s;t Gentleman in the Nation: that in Knowledge, in Manners, in Judgment of things, the Merchant out did many of the Nobility; that hav|ing once ma&s;ter'd the World, and being above the De|mand of Bu&s;ine&s;s, tho' no real E&s;tate, they were then $$perior to mo&s;t Gentlemen, even in E&s;tate; that a Merchant in fle&s;h Bu&s;ine&s;s, and a capital Stock, is able to &s;pend more Money than a Gentleman of <HI>5000l.</HI> a Year E&s;tate; that while a Merchant &s;pent, he only &s;pent what he got, and not that; and that he laid up great Sums every Year.</P>
<P>That an E&s;tate is a Pond; but that a Trade was a Spring; that if the fir&s;t is once mortgag'd, it &s;eldom gets clear, but embarra&s;s'd the Per&s;on for ever; but the Merchant had his E&s;tate continually flowing; and open this, he nam'd me Merchants who liv'd in more real Splendor, and &s;pent more Money than mo&s;t of the Noblemen in <HI>England</HI> cou'd &s;ingly expend, and that they full grew immen&s;ely rich.</P>
<P>He went on to tell me, that even the Trad&s;emen in <HI>London,</HI> &s;peaking of the better Sort of Trades, cou'd &s;pend more Money in their Families, and give better Fortunes to their Children, than, generally &s;peaking, the Gentry of <HI>England</HI> from a <HI>1000l.</HI> a Year down|ward, cou'd do, and yet grow rich too.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="178">
The Up&s;hot of all this was, to recommend to me, rather the be&s;towing my Fortune upon &s;ome eminent Merchant, who liv'd already in the fir&s;t Figure of a Merchant, and who not being in Want or Scarcity of Money, but having a flouri&s;hing Bu&s;ine&s;s, and a flow|ing Ca&s;h, wou'd at the fir&s;t Word, &s;ettle all my For|tune on my&s;elf and Children, and maintain me like a Queen.</P>
<P>This was certainly right; and had I taken his Ad|vice, I had really been happy; but my Heart was bent upon an Independency of Fortune; and I told him, I knew no State of Matrimony, but what was, at be&s;t, a State of Inferiority, if not of Bondage; that I had no Notion of it; that I liv'd a Life of ab&s;olute Liberty now; was free as I was born, and having a plentiful Fortune, I did not under&s;tand what Coherence the Words <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Obey</HI> had with the Liberty of a <HI>F$ee Woman;</HI> that I knew no Rea&s;on the Men had to engro&s;s the whole Liberty of the Race, and make the Women, notwith&s;tanding any De&s;parity of Fortune, be &s;ubject to the Laws of Marriage, of their own making; that it was my Misfortune to be a Woman, but I was re|&s;olv'd it &s;hould not be made wor&s;e by the Sex; and &s;ee|ing Liberty &s;eem'd to be the Men's Property, I wou'd be a <HI>Man Woman;</HI> for as I was born free, I wou'd die &s;o</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Robert</HI> &s;mil'd, and told me, I talk'd a kind of <HI>Amaz$$ian</HI> Language; that he found few Women of my Mind, or that if they were, they wanted Re&s;olution to go on with it; that notwith&s;tanding all my Notions, which he could not but &s;ay had once &s;ome Weight in them, yet he under&s;tood I had broke in upon them, and had been marry'd. I an&s;wer'd, I had &s;o, but he did not hear me &s;ay, that I had any Encouragement from what was pa&s;t, to make a &s;econd Venture; that I'was got well out of the Toil, and if I came in again I &s;hould have no body to blame but my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Robert</HI> laugh'd heartily at me, but gave over of|fering any more Arguments, only told me, he had pointed me out for &s;ome of the be&s;t Merchants in <HI>Lon|don,</HI>
<PB N="181" REF="179">
but &s;ince I forbad him, he wou'd give me no Di&s;|turbance of that Kind; he applauded my Way of ma|naging my Money, and told me, I &s;hou'd &s;oon be mon&s;trous rich; but he neither knew, or mi&s;tru&s;ted, that with all this Wealth, I was yet a Whore, and was not aver&s;e to adding to my E&s;tate at the farther Expence of my Virtue.</P>
<P>But to go on with my Story as to my Way of living; I found, as above, that my living as I did wou'd not an&s;wer; that it only brought the <HI>Fortune-hunters</HI> and Bites about me, as I have &s;aid before, to make a Prey of me and my Money; and in &s;hort, I was harra&s;s'd with Lovers, <HI>Beaux,</HI> and <HI>Fops</HI> of Quality, in abundance; but it wou'd not do, I aim'd at other Things, and was po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with &s;o vain an Opinion of my own Beauty, that nothing le&s;s than a KING him&s;elf was in my Eye; and this Vanity was rais'd by &s;ome Words let fall by a Per&s;on I convers'd with, who was, perhaps, likely enough to have brought &s;uch a Thing to pa&s;s, had it been &s;ooner; <HI>but that Game began to be pretty well over at Court:</HI> However, the having mention'd &s;uch a thing, it &s;eems, a little too publickly, it brought abundance of People about me, upon a wicked Account too.</P>
<P>And now I began to act in a new Sphere; the Court was exceeding gay $nd fine, tho' fuller of Men than of Women, the Queen not affecting to be very much in publick; on the other Hand, it is no Slander upon the Courtiers, to &s;ay, they were as wicked as any body in Rea&s;on cou'd de&s;ire them: The KING had &s;everal Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, who were prodigious &s;ine, and there was a glorious Show on that Side indeed: If the Sovereign give him&s;elf a Loo&s;e, it cou'd not be expected the re&s;t of the Court &s;hou'd be all Saints; &s;o far was it from that though I wou'd not make it wor&s;e than it was, that a Woman that had any Thing agreeable in her Ap|pearance, cou'd never want Followers.</P>
<P>I &s;oon found my&s;elf throng'd with Admirers, and I receiv'd Vi&s;its from &s;ome Per&s;ons of very great Figure, who always introduc'd them&s;elves by the help of an old Lady or two, who were now become my Intimates;
<PB N="182" REF="180">
and one of them, I under&s;tood afterwards, was &s;et to work on purpo&s;e to get into my Favour, in order to in|troduce what follow'd.</P>
<P>The Conver&s;ation we had, was generally courtly, but civil, at length, &s;ome Gentlemen propos'd to Play, and made, what they call'd, a Party; this it &s;eems, was a Contrivance of one of my Female Hangers-on, <HI>for, as I &s;aid, I had two of them,</HI> who thought this was the Way to introduce People as often as &s;he pleas'd, and &s;o indeed, it was, They play'd high, and &s;tay'd late, but begg'd my Pardon, only ask'd Leave to make an Appointment for the next Night. I was as gay, and as well pleas'd as any of them, and one Night told one of the Gentlemen, my Lord&mdash;, that &s;eeing they were doing me the Honour of diverting them&s;elves at my Apartment, and de&s;ir'd to be there &s;ometimes, I did not keep a Gaming Table, but I wou'd give them a little Ball the next Day, if they pleas'd; which they accepted very willingly.</P>
<P>Accordingly in the Evening the Gentlemen began to come, where I let them &s;ee, that I under&s;tood very well what &s;uch Things meant: I had a large Di$e|ing Room in my Apartments, with five other Rooms in the &s;ame Floor, all which I made Drawing Rooms for the Occa&s;ion, having all the Beds taken down for the Day; in three of the&s;e I had Tables plac'd, co|ver'd with Wine and Sweet-meats; the fourth had a green Table for Play, and the fifth was my own Room, where I &s;at, and where I receiv'd all the Company that came to pay their Compliments to me: I was dre&s;s'd, you may be &s;ure to all the Advantage po&s;&s;ible, and had all the Jewels on, that I was Mi&s;tre&s;s of: My Lord&mdash;, to whom I made the Invitation, &s;ent me a Sett of fine Mu&s;ick from the Play-Hou&s;e, and the La|dies danc'd, and we began to be very merry; when about eleven a Clock, I had Notice given me, that there were &s;ome Gentlemen coming in Ma&s;querade.</P>
<P>I &s;eem'd a little &s;urpriz'd, and began to apprehend &s;ome Di&s;turbance; when my Lord&mdash;perceiving it, &s;poke to me to be ea&s;y, for that there was a Party of
<PB N="183" REF="181">
the Guards at the Door, which &s;hou'd be ready to pre|vent any Rudene&s;s; and another Gentleman gave me a Hint, as if the KING was among the Ma&s;ks; I colour|ed as red as Blood it&s;elf cou'd make a Face look, and expre&s;s'd a great Surprize; however, there was no go|ing back; &s;o I kept my Station in my Drawing-room, but with the Folding doors wide open.</P>
<P>A while after, the Masks came in, and began with a Dance <HI>a la Comique,</HI> performing wonderfully indeed: while they were dancing, I withdrew, and left a Lady to an&s;wer for me, that I wou'd return immediately; in le&s;s than half an Hour I return'd, dre&s;s'd in the Habit of <HI>a Turki&s;h Prince&s;s;</HI> the Habit I got at <HI>Leghorn,</HI> when my <HI>Foreign Prince</HI> bought me a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Slave, as I have &s;a$d, the <HI>Ma$the&s;e</HI> Man of War had, it &s;eems, taken a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;el going from <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> to <HI>Alexandria,</HI> in which were &s;ome Ladies bound for <HI>Grand Cairo</HI> in <HI>Egypt;</HI> and as the Ladies were made Slaves, &s;o their fine Cloaths were thus expos'd; and with this <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Slave, I bought the rich Cloaths too: The Dre&s;s was extraordinary fine indeed, I had bought it as a Curio&s;i|ty, having never &s;een the like; the Robe was a fine <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> Dama&s;k; the Ground white, and the Flowers blue and gold, and the Train held five Yards; the Dre&s;s under it, was a Ve&s;t of the &s;ame, embroider'd with Gold, and &s;et with &s;ome Pearl in the Work, and &s;ome <HI>Turquois</HI> Stones; to the Ve&s;t, was a Girdle five or &s;ix Inches wide, after the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Mode; and on both Ends where it join'd, or hook'd, was &s;et with Diamonds for eight Inches either Way, only they were not true Diamonds; but no body knew that but my&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Turban, or Head-Dre&s;s, had a Pinacle on the Top, but not above five Inches, with a Piece of loo&s;e Sarcenet hanging from it; and on the Front, ju&s;t over the Forehead, was a good Jewel, which I had added to it.</P>
<P>This Habit, as above, co&s;t me about &s;ixty Pi&s;toles in <HI>Italy,</HI> but co&s;t much more in the Country from whence it came; and little did I think, when I bought
<PB N="184" REF="182">
it, that I &s;hou'd put it to &s;uch a U&s;e as this; tho' I had dre&s;s'd my&s;elf in it many Times, by the help of my little <HI>Turk,</HI> and afterwards between <HI>Amy</HI> and I, only to &s;ee how I look'd in it: I had &s;ent her up before, to get it ready, and when I came up, I had nothing to do but to &s;lip it on, and was down in my Drawing-Room in a little more than a quarter of an Hour. When I came there, the Room was full of Company, but I order'd the Folding-Doors to be &s;hut for a Minute or two, till I had receiv'd the Compliments of the Ladies that were in the Room, and had given them a full View of my Dre&s;s.</P>
<P>But my Lord&mdash;, who happen'd to be in the Room, &s;lipp'd out at another Door, and brought back with him one of the Ma&s;ks, a tall well-&s;hap'd Per&s;on, but who had no Name, being all ma&s;k'd, nor would it have been allow'd to ask any Per&s;on's Name on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion; the Per&s;on &s;poke in <HI>French</HI> to me, that it was the fine&s;t Dre&s;s he had ever &s;een; and ask'd me, if he &s;hou'd have the Honour to dance with me? I bow'd, as giving my Con&s;ent, but &s;aid, As I had been a <HI>Mahometan,</HI> I cou'd not dance after the Manner of this Country; I &s;uppos'd their Mu&s;ick wou'd not play <HI>a la More&s;que:</HI> he an&s;wer'd merrily, I had a Chri&s;tian's Face, and he'd venture it, that I cou'd dance like a Chri&s;tian; adding, that &s;o much Beauty cou'd not be <HI>Mahometan:</HI> immediately the Folding-doors were flung open, and he led me into the Room: The Company were under the greate&s;t Surprize imaginable; the ve|ry Mu&s;ick &s;topp'd a while to gaze; for the Dre&s;s was indeed exceedingly &s;urprizing, perfectly new, very agreeable, and wonderful rich.</P>
<P>The Gentleman, whoever he was, for I never knew, led me only a Courant, and then ask'd me, if I had a Mind to dance an Antick, that is to &s;ay, whether I wou'd dance the Antick as they had danc'd in Ma&s;que|rade, or any Thing by my&s;elf; I told him any Thing el&s;e rather, if he pleas'd; &s;o we danc'd only two <HI>French</HI> Dances, and he led me to the Drawing-room Door, when he retir'd to the re&s;t of the Ma&s;ks: When he left
<PB N="185" REF="183">
me at the Drawing-room Door, I did not go in, as he thought I wou'd have done, but turn'd about, and &s;how'd my&s;elf to the whole Room, and calling my Wo|man to me, gave her &s;ome Directions to the Mu&s;ick, by which the Company pre&s;ently under&s;tood that I would give them a Dance by my&s;elf: Immediately all the Hou&s;e ro&s;e up, and paid me a kind of a Compliment, by removing back every Way to make me Room, for the Place was exceeding full; the Mu&s;ick did not at fir&s;t hit the Tune that I directed, which was a <HI>French</HI> Tune, &s;o I was forc'd to &s;end my Woman to them a|gain, &s;tanding all this while at my Drawing-room Door; but as &s;oon as my Woman &s;poke to them again, they play'd it right; and I, to let them &s;ee it was &s;o, &s;tepp'd forward to the middle of the Room; then they began it again, and I danc'd by my&s;elf a Figure which I learnt in <HI>France,</HI> when the Prince <HI>de&mdash;</HI>de&s;ir'd I wou'd dance for his Diver&s;ion; it was indeed, a very fine Figure, invented by a famous Ma&s;ter at <HI>Paris,</HI> for a Lady or Gentleman to dance &s;ingle; but being per|fectly new, it pleas'd the Company exceedingly, and they all thought it had been <HI>Turki&s;h;</HI> nay, one Gen|man had the Folly to expo&s;e him&s;elf &s;o much as to &s;ay, and I think &s;wore too, that he had &s;een it danc'd at <HI>Con&s;tantinop'e;</HI> which was ridiculous enough.</P>
<P>At the fini&s;hing the Dance, the Company clapp'd, and almo&s;t &s;houted; and one of the Gentlemen cry'd out, <HI>Roxana! Roxana!</HI> by&mdash;, with an Oath; upon which fooli&s;h Accident I had the Name of <HI>Roxana</HI> pre&s;ently fix'd upon me all over the Court End of the Town, as effectually as if I had been Chri&s;ten'd <HI>Roxana.</HI> I had, it &s;eems, the Felicity of plea&s;ing every Body that Night, to an Extreme; and my Ball, but e&s;peci|cially my Dre&s;s, was the Chat of the Town for that Week, and &s;o the Name <HI>Roxana</HI> was the Toa&s;t at and about the Court; no other Health was to be nam'd with it.</P>
<P>Now Things began to work as I wou'd have them, and I began to be very popular, as much as I cou'd de&s;ire: The Ball held till (as well as I was pleas'd with the Show) I was &s;ick of the Night; the Gentle|men
<PB N="186" REF="184">
mask'd went off about three a Clock in the Morn|ing, the other Gentlemen &s;at down to Play; the Mu&s;ick held it out; and &s;ome of the Ladies were dancing at Six in the Morning.</P>
<P>But I was mighty eager to know who it was that danc'd with me; &s;ome of the Lords went &s;o far as to tell me, I was very much honour'd in my Compa|ny; one of them &s;poke &s;o broad, as almo&s;t to &s;ay is was the KING, but I was convinc'd afterwards, it was not; and another reply'd, If he had been his Maje&s;ty, he &s;hou'd have thought it no Di&s;honour to lead up a <HI>Roxana;</HI> but to this Hour I never knew po&s;itively who it was; and by his Behaviour I thought he was too young, His Maje&s;ty being at that Time in an Age that might be di&s;cover'd from a young Per&s;on, even in his Dancing.</P>
<P>Be that as it wou'd, I had 500 Guineas &s;ent me the next Morning, and the Me&s;&s;enger was order'd to tell me, that the Per&s;ons who &s;ent it, de&s;ir'd a Ball again at my Lodgings on the next <HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> but that they wou'd have my Leave to give the Entertainment them|&s;elves: I was mighty well pleas'd with this (to be &s;ure) but very inqui&s;itive to know who the Money came from; but the Me&s;&s;enger was &s;ilent as Death as to that Point; and bowing always at my Enquiries, begg'd me to ask no Que&s;tions which he cou'd not give an obliging An&s;wer to.</P>
<P>I forgot to mention that the Gentlemen that play'd, gave an hundred Guineas to the Box, as they call'd it, and at the End of their Play, they ask'd for my Gentle|woman of the Bed Chamber, as they call'd her, (Mrs. <HI>Amy,</HI> for&s;ooth) and gave it her; and gave twenty Gui|neas more among the Servants.</P>
<P>This magnificent Doings equally both pleas'd and &s;urpriz'd me, and I hardly knew where I was: but e&s;pecially, that Notion of the KING being the Per&s;on that danc'd with me, puff'd me up to that Degree, that I not only did not know any-body el&s;e, but indeed, was very far from knowing my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I had now the next <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> out to provide for the like
<PB N="187" REF="185">
Company; but alas! it was all taken out of my Hand; three Gentlemen, who yet were, it &s;eems, but Servants, came on the <HI>Saturday,</HI> and bringing &s;ufficient Te&s;timo|nies that they were right, for one was the &s;ame who brought the five hundred Guineas; I &s;ay, three of them came, and brought Bottles of all Sorts of Wines, and Hampers of Sweet-meats to &s;uch a Quantity, it appear|ed they de&s;ign'd to hold the Trade on more than once, and that they would furni&s;h every Thing to a Pro|fu&s;ion.</P>
<P>However, as I found a Deficiency in two Things, I made Provi&s;ion of about twelve Dozen of fine Dama&s;k Napkins, with Table cloaths of the &s;ame, &s;ufficient to cover all the Tables, with three Table-cloaths upon every Table, and Side-boards in Proportion; I al&s;o bought a hand&s;ome Quantity of Plate, nece&s;&s;ary to have &s;erv'd all the Side-boards, but the Gentlemen would not &s;uffer any of it to be us'd, telling me, they had bought fine <HI>China</HI> Di&s;hes and Plates for the whole Service, and that in &s;uch publick Places they cou'd not be an&s;werable for the Plate; &s;o it was &s;et all up in a large Gla&s;s-Cupboard in the Room I &s;at in, where it made a very good Show indeed.</P>
<P>On <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> there came &s;uch an Appearance of Gentle|men and Ladies, that my Apartments were by no Means able to receive them; and tho&s;e who in particu|lar appear'd as Principals, gave Order below, to let no more Company come up; the Street was full of Coach|es with Coronets, and fine Gla&s;s Chairs; and in &s;hort, it was impo&s;&s;ible to receive the Company. I kept my little Room, as before, and the Dancers fill'd the great Room; all the Drawing-Rooms al&s;o were fill'd, and three Rooms below Stairs, which were not mine.</P>
<P>It was very well that there was a &s;trong Party of the Guards brought to keep the Door, for without that, $he$e had been &s;uch a promi&s;cuous Crowd, and &s;ome of them &s;candalous too, that we &s;hou'd have been all Di&s;|order and Confu&s;ion; but the three Head Servants ma|nag'd all that, and had a Word to admit all the Com|pany by.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="186">
It was uncertain to me, and is to this Day, who it was that danc'd with me the <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> before, when the Ball was my own; but that the K&mdash;was at this A&s;|&s;embly, was out of Que&s;tion with me, by Cir|cum&s;tances that I &s;uppo&s;e I could not be deceived in; and particularly, that there were five Per&s;ons who were not mask'd, three of them had blue Gar|ters, and they appeared not to me till I came out to dance.</P>
<P>This Meeting was manag'd ju&s;t as the fir&s;t, tho' with much more Magnificence, becau&s;e of the Company. I plac'd my&s;elf (exceedingly rich in Cloaths and Jewels) in the middle of my little Room, as before, and made my Compliment to all the Company, as they pa&s;s'd me, as I did before; but my Lord&mdash;, who had &s;poken openly to me the fir&s;t Night, came to me, and unmask|ing told me the Company had order'd him to tell me, they hop'd they &s;hould &s;ee me in the Dre&s;s I had ap|peared in the fir&s;t Day, which had been &s;o acceptable, that it had been the Occa&s;ion of this new Meeting; and Madam, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> there are &s;ome in this A&s;&s;embly, who it is worth your while to oblige.</P>
<P>I bow'd to my Lord&mdash;, and immediately with|drew. While I was above, a dre&s;&s;ing in my new Habit, two Ladies, perfectly unknown to me, were convey'd into my Apartment below, by the Order of a noble Per|&s;on, who, with his whole Family had been in <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> and here indeed I thought I &s;hould have been out-done, or perhaps baulk'd.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e Ladies was dre&s;s'd mo&s;t exqui&s;itely fine indeed, in the Habit of a Virgin Lady of Quality of <HI>Georgia,</HI> and the other in the &s;ame Habit of <HI>Armenia,</HI> with each of them a Woman-&s;lave to attend them.</P>
<P>The Ladies had their Petticoats &s;hort to their Ancles, but pleated all round, and before them &s;hort Aprons, but of the fine&s;t Point that could be &s;een, their Gown, were made with long antic Sleeves hanging down behind, and a Train let down; they had no Jewels, but their Heads and Brea&s;ts were dre&s;s'd up with Flowers, and they both came in veil'd.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="187">
Their Slaves were <HI>bare-headed,</HI> but their long black Hair was breeded in Locks hanging down behind to their Wa&s;tes, and tied up with Ribbons; they were $dre&s;s'd exceeding rich, and were as beautiful as their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es; for none of them had any Masks on. They waited in my Room till I came down, and all paid their Re&s;pects to me after the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Manner, and &s;at down on a <HI>Safra,</HI> that is to &s;ay, almo&s;t cro&s;s-legg'd on a Couch made up of Cu&s;hions laid on the Ground.</P>
<P>This was admirably fine, and I was indeed &s;tartled at $t. They made their Compliment to me in <HI>French,</HI> and I reply'd in the &s;ame Language. When the Doors were opened, they walked into the Dancing-room, and danc'd &s;uch a Dance as indeed no Body there had ever &s;een, and to an In&s;trument like a Guittar, with a &s;mall low &s;ound|ing Trumpet, which indeed was very fine, and which my Lord&mdash;had provided.</P>
<P>They danc'd three Times all alone, for no Body in|$$ed could dance with them. The Novelty plea&s;ed truly, but yet there was &s;omething wild and <HI>Bizarre</HI> in $t, becau&s;e they really acted to the Life the barbarous Country whence they came; but as mine had the <HI>French</HI> Behaviour under the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Dre&s;s, it was every Way $s new, and plea&s;ed much better indeed.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as they had &s;hewn their <HI>Georgian</HI> and <HI>Armeni|$n</HI> Shapes, and danc'd, as I have &s;aid, three Times, $hey withdrew, paid their Compliment to me, (for I $as Queen of the Day) and went off to undre&s;s.</P>
<P>Some Gentlemen then danc'd with Ladies all in $lasks, and when they &s;topp'd, no Body ro&s;e up to $ance, but all call'd out <HI>Roxana, Roxana;</HI> in the In|$erval, my Lord&mdash;had brought another mask'd Per&s;on into my Room, whom I knew not, only that I $ould di&s;cern it was not the &s;ame Per&s;on that led me out before. This noble Per&s;on (for I afterwards under&s;tood $t was the Duke of&mdash;) after a &s;hort Compliment, $ed me out into the middle of the Room.</P>
<P>I was dre&s;s'd in the &s;ame Ve&s;t and Girdle, as before; $ut the Robe had a Mantle over it, which is u&s;ual in $he <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Habit, and it was of Crim&s;on and of Green, $he Green brocaded with Gold; and my <HI>Tyhiaai,</HI> or
<PB N="190" REF="188">
<HI>Head-dre&s;s,</HI> vary'd a little from that I had before, as it &s;tood higher, and had &s;ome Jewels about the ri&s;ing Part, which made it look like a Turban crown'd.</P>
<P>I had no Mask, neither did I paint, and yet I had the Day of all the Ladies that appear'd at the Ball, I mean, of tho&s;e that appeared with Faces on; as for tho&s;e mask'd, nothing could be &s;aid of them, no doubt there might be many finer than I was; it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;s'd that the Habit was infinitely advantageous to me, and every Body look'd at me with a kind of Plea&s;ure, which gave me great Advantage too.</P>
<P>After I had danc'd with that noble Per&s;on, I did not offer to dance by my&s;elf, as I had before; but they all call'd out <HI>Roxana</HI> again; and two of the Gentlemen came into the Drawing-room, to intreat me to give them the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Dance, which I yielded to readily, &s;o I came out and danc'd ju&s;t as at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>While I was dancing, I perceiv'd five Per&s;ons &s;tand|ing all together, and among them one only with his Hat on; it was an immediate Hint to me who it was, and had at fir&s;t almo&s;t put me into &s;ome Di&s;order; but I went on, receiv'd the Applau&s;e of the Hou&s;e, as be|fore, and retir'd into my own Room; when I was there the five Gentlemen came cro&s;s the Room to my Side, and coming in, followed by a Throng of great Per&s;ons, the Per&s;on with his Hat on, &s;aid, Madam <HI>Roxana,</HI> you <HI>perform to Admiration.</HI> I was prepar'd, and offer'd to kneel to ki&s;s his Hand, but he declin'd it, and &s;aluted me, and &s;o pa&s;&s;ing back again thro' the great Room, went away.</P>
<P>I do not &s;ay here who this was, but I &s;ay, I came af|terwards to know &s;omething more plainly. I would have withdrawn, and di&s;rob'd, being &s;omewhat too $Word$ in that Dre&s;s, unlac'd and open-brea&s;ted, as if I had been in my Shift; but it could not be, and I was ob|lig'd to dance afterwards with &s;ix or eight Gentlemen, mo&s;t, if not all of them, of the fir&s;t Rank; and I was told afterwards, that one of them was the D&mdash;of <HI>M&mdash;th.</HI></P>
<P>About two or three o'Clock in the Morning the Com|pany began to decrea&s;e, the Number of Women e&s;peci|cially
<PB N="191" REF="189">
dropp'd away Home, &s;ome and &s;ome at a Time; $nd the Gentlemen retired down Stairs, where they un|$$sk'd and went to Play.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> waited at the Room where they played, &s;at up $ll Night to attend them, and in the Morning when $hey broke up they &s;wept the Box into her Lap, when $he counted out to me &s;ixty two Guineas and a half; and $e other Servants got very well too. <HI>Amy</HI> came to me then they were all gone, <HI>Law&mdash;Madam,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Amy,</HI> with a long gaping Cry, <HI>what &s;hall I do with all this $oney?</HI> And indeed the poor Creature was half mad $ith Joy.</P>
<P>I was now in my Element; I was as much talk'd of $s any Body could de&s;ire, and I did not doubt but &s;ome|thing or other would come of it, but the Report of my $eing &s;o rich rather was a Baulk to my View than any $hing el&s;e, for the Gentlemen that would perhaps have $een: routle&s;ome enough otherwi&s;e, &s;eem'd to be kept $Word$; for <HI>Roxana</HI> was too high for them.</P>
<P>There is a Scene which came in here, which I mu&s;t over from human Eyes or Ears; for three Years and a|$$t a Month <HI>Roxana</HI> lived retir'd, having been oblig'd $$ make an Excur&s;ion in a Manner, and with a Per&s;on $hich Duty and private Vows obliges her not to reveal, $$ lea&s;t, not yet.</P>
<P>At the End of this Time I appeared again; but I $uit add, that as I had in this Time of Retreat, <HI>made $ay,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;&s;o I did not come abroad again with $e &s;ame Lu&s;tre, or &s;hine with &s;o much Advantage as $efore; for as &s;ome People had got at lea&s;t a Su&s;picion $$ where I had been, and who had had me all the while, began to be public that <HI>Roxana</HI> was, in &s;hort, a meer <HI>Roxana,</HI> neither better nor wor&s;e, and not that Woman Honour and Virtue that was at fir&s;t &s;uppos'd.</P>
<P>You are now to &s;uppo&s;e me about &s;even Years come Town, and that I had not only &s;uffered the old Re|$$nue, which I hinted was manag'd by Sir <HI>Robert Clay|$$,</HI> to grow, as was mentioned before; but I had laid $ an incredible Wealth, the Time con&s;idered; and had $et had the lea&s;t Thought of reforming, I had all the $portunity to do it with Advantage that ever Woman
<PB N="192" REF="190">
had; for the common Vice of all Whores, I mean Money was out of the Que&s;tion, nay, even Avarice it|&s;elf &s;eem'd to be glutted; for, including what I had &s;av'd in re&s;erving the Intere&s;t of 14000 <HI>l.</HI> which, as a|bove, I had left to grow; and including &s;ome very good Pre&s;ents I had made to me in meer Compliment, upon the&s;e &s;hining ma&s;querading Meetings, which I held up for about two Years, and what I made of three Years of the mo&s;t glorious Retreat, <HI>as I call it,</HI> that ever Wo|man had, I had fully doubled my fir&s;t Sub&s;tance, and had near 5000 Pounds in Money, which I kept at Home; be&s;ides Abundance of Plate and Jewels, which I had either given me, or had bought to &s;et my&s;elf out for public Days.</P>
<P>In a Word, I had now five and thirty thou&s;and Pounds E&s;tate; and as I found Ways to live without wa&s;ting either Principal or Intere&s;t, I laid up 2000 <HI>l.</HI> every Year at lea&s;t out of the meer Intere&s;t, adding it to the Prin|cipal; and thus I went on.</P>
<P>After the End of what I call my Retreat, and out of which I brought a great deal of Money, I appeared a|gain, but I &s;eem'd like an old Piece of Plate that had been hoarded up &s;ome Years, and comes out tarni&s;h'd and di&s;colour'd; &s;o I came out blown, and look'd like <HI>a ca&s;t-off Mi&s;tre&s;s,</HI> nor indeed was I any better; tho' I was not at all impair'd in Beauty, except that I was a little fatter than I was formerly, and always granting that I was four Years older.</P>
<P>However, I pre&s;erv'd the Youth of my Temper; wa$ always bright, plea&s;ant in Company, and agreeable to every Body, or el&s;e every Body flatter'd me; and in this Condition I came abroad to the World again; and tho' I was not &s;o popular as before, and indeed did not &s;eek it, becau&s;e I knew it could not be; yet I was fa$ from being without Company, and that of the greate$$ Quality, <HI>of Subjects I mean,</HI> who frequently vi&s;ited me$ and &s;ometimes we had Meetings for Mirth and Play a$ my Apartments, where I &s;ail'd not to divert them in th$ mo&s;t agreeable Manner po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Nor could any of them make the lea&s;t particular Ap|plication to me from the Notion they had of my exce$|five
<PB N="193" REF="191">
Wealth, which, as they thought, plac'd me above the Meanne&s;s of a Maintenance, and &s;o left no Room to come ea&s;ily about me.</P>
<P>But at la&s;t I was very hand&s;omely attack'd by a Per|&s;on of Honour, and (which recommended him particu|larly to me) a Per&s;on of a very great E&s;tate; he made a long Introduction to me upon the Subject of my Wealth. Ignorant Creature! <HI>&s;aid I to my&s;elf,</HI> con&s;idering him as a LORD, was there ever Woman in the World that could &s;toop to the Ba&s;ene&s;s of being a Whore, and was above taking the Reward of her Vice! <HI>No, no, depend upon it, if your Lord&s;hip obtains any Thing of me you mu&s;t pay for it; and the Notion of my being &s;o rich &s;erves only to make it co&s;t you the dearer, &s;eeing you cannot offer a &s;mall Matter to a Woman of</HI> 2000 l. <HI>a Year E&s;tate.</HI></P>
<P>After he had harrangu'd upon that Subject a good while, and had a&s;&s;ur'd me he had no De&s;ign upon me, that he did not come to make a Prize of me, or to pick my Pocket, which (by the Way) I was in no Fear of, for I took too much Care of my Money, to part with any of it that Way; he then turn'd his Di&s;cour&s;e to the Subject of Love; a Point &s;o ridiculous to me, without the main Thing, I mean the Money, that I had no Pa|tience to hear him make &s;o long a Story of it.</P>
<P>I receiv'd him civilly, and let him &s;ee I could bear to hear a wicked Propo&s;al, without being affronted, and yet I was not to be brought into it too ea&s;ily. He vi&s;it|ed me a long while, and in &s;hort courted me as clo&s;ely and a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly, as if he had been wooing me to Matri|mony; he made me &s;everal valuable Pre&s;ents, which I &s;uffer'd my&s;elf to be prevail'd with to accept, but not without great Difficulty.</P>
<P>Gradually I &s;uffer'd all his other Importunities, and when he made a Propo&s;al of a Compliment, or Appoint|ment to me for a Settlement, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> That tho' I was rich, yet there was not the le&s;s due from him to acknow|ledge the Favours he received; and that if I was to be his I &s;hould not live at my own Expence, <HI>co&s;t what it would.</HI> I told him I was far from being extravagant, and yet I did not live at the Expence of le&s;s than 500 <HI>l.</HI> a Year out of my own Pocket; that however, I was
<PB N="194" REF="192">
not covetous of &s;ettled Allowances, for I look'd upon that as a kind of <HI>Golden Chain,</HI> &s;omething like Matri|mony; that tho' I knew how to be true to a Man of Honour, as I knew his Lord&s;hip to be, yet I had a kind of Aver&s;ion to the Bonds; and tho' I was not &s;o rich as the World talk'd me up to be, yet I was not &s;o poor as to bind my&s;elf to Hard&s;hips for a Pen&s;ion.</P>
<P>He told me he expected to make my Life perfectly ea&s;y, and intended it &s;o; that he knew of no Bondage there could be in a private Engagement between us; that the Bonds of Honour he knew I would be ty'd by, and think them no Burthen, and for other Obligations, he &s;corn'd to expect any Thing from me, but what he knew, as a Woman of Honour, I could grant; then as to Maintenance he told me he would &s;oon &s;hew me that he valued me infinitely above 500 <HI>l.</HI> a Year; and upon this Foot we began.</P>
<P>I &s;eem'd kinder to him after this Di&s;cour&s;e; and as Time and private Conver&s;ation made us very intimate, we began to come nearer to the main Article, <HI>namely,</HI> the 500 <HI>l.</HI> a Year; he offer'd that at fir&s;t Word, and to ac|knowledge it as an infinite Favour to have it be accepted of; and I, that thought it was too much by all the Mo|ney, &s;uffer'd my&s;elf to be ma&s;ter'd or prevail'd with to yield, even on but a bare Engagement upon Parole.</P>
<P>When he had obtained his End that Way, I told him my Mind: Now you &s;ee, my Lord, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> how weak|ly I have acted, <HI>namely,</HI> to yield to you without any Ca|pitulation, or any Thing &s;ecur'd to me, but that which you may cea&s;e to allow when you plea&s;e; if I am the le&s;s valued for &s;uch a Confidence, I &s;hall be injur'd in a Man|ner that I will endeavour not to de&s;erve.</P>
<P>He told me that he would make it evident to me, that he did not &s;eek me by Way of Bargain, as &s;uch Things were often done; that as I had treated him with a ge|nerous Confidence, &s;o I &s;hould find I was in the Hands of a Man of Honour, and one that knew how to value the Obligation; and upon this he pull'd out a Gold|&s;mith's Bill for 300 <HI>l.</HI> which, putting it into my Hand, he &s;aid he gave me as a Pledge, that I &s;hould not be
<PB N="195" REF="193">
a Lo&s;er by my not having made a Bargain with him.</P>
<P>This was engaging indeed, and gave me a good Idea of our future Corre&s;pondence; and, in &s;hort, as I could not re&s;rain treating him with more Kindne&s;s than I had done before, &s;o one Thing begeting another, I gave him &s;everal Te&s;timonies that I was entirely his own by Inclination, as well as by the common Obligation of a Mi&s;tre&s;s; and this plea&s;ed him exceedingly.</P>
<P>Soon after this private Engagement, I began to con|&s;ider whether it were not more &s;uitable to the Manner of Life I now led, to be a little le&s;s public; and as I told my Lord it would rid me of the Importunities of others, and of continual Vi&s;its from a Sort of People who he knew of, and who, by the Way, having now got the Notion of me which I really de&s;erved, began to talk of the old Game, Love and Gallantry, and to offer at what was rude enough; Things as nau&s;eous to me now as if I had been married, and as virtuous as other Folks: The Vi&s;its of the&s;e People began indeed to be unea&s;y to me, and particularly, as they were always very tedious and impertinent; nor could my Lord&mdash;be plea&s;ed with them at all, if they had gone on. It would be di|verting to &s;et down here in what Manner I repuls'd tho&s;e Sort of People; how in &s;ome I re&s;ented it as an Affront, and told them, that I was &s;orry they &s;hould oblige me to vindicate my&s;elf from the Scandal of &s;uch Sugge&s;ti|ons, by telling them, that <HI>I could &s;ee them no more,</HI> and by de&s;iring them not to give them&s;elves the Trouble of vi&s;iting me, who (tho' I was not willing to be uncivil) yet thought my&s;elf obliged never to receive a Vi&s;it from any Gentleman after he had made &s;uch Propo&s;als at tho&s;e to me: But the&s;e Things would be too tedious to bring in here; it was on this Account I propo&s;ed to his Lord&s;hip my taking new Lodgings for Privacy; be|&s;ides, I con&s;idered that as I might live very hand&s;omely, and yet not &s;o publickly, &s;o I needed not &s;pend &s;o much Money by a great deal; and if I made 500 <HI>l.</HI> a Year of this generous Per&s;on, it was more than I had Occa&s;ion for.</P>
<P>My Lord came readily into this Propo&s;al, and went farther than I expected; for he found out a Lodging
<PB N="196" REF="194">
for me in a very hand&s;ome Hou&s;e, where yet he was not known; I &s;uppo&s;e he had employed &s;omebody to find it out for him; and where he had a convenient Way to come into the Garden by a Door that opened into the Park, a Thing very rarely allowed in tho&s;e Times.</P>
<P>By this Key he could come in at what Time of Night or Day he plea&s;ed; and as we had al&s;o a little Door in the lower Part of the Hou&s;e, which was always left up|on the Lock, and his was the Ma&s;ter-Key, &s;o if it was twelve, one, or two o' Clock in the Morning, he could come directly into my Bed-chamber. <HI>N. B.</HI> I was not afraid I &s;hould be found a Bed with any Body el&s;e, for, in a Word, I conver&s;ed with no Body at all.</P>
<P>It happened plea&s;antly enough one Night; his Lord|&s;hip had &s;taid late, and I not expecting him that Night, had taken <HI>Amy</HI> to Bed with me, and when my Lord came into the Chamber we were both fa&s;t a&s;leep, I think it was near three o' Clock when he came in, and a little merry, but not at all fuddl'd, or what they call in Drink; and he came at once into the Room.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was frighted out of her Wits, and cry'd cut. <HI>I &s;aid calmly,</HI> indeed my Lord I did not expect you to Night, and we have been a little frighted to Night with Fire. O! <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I &s;ee you have got a Bed-fellow with you; I began to make an Apology, <HI>No, no, &s;ays my Lord,</HI> you need no Excu&s;e, 'tis not a Man-bed-fellow I &s;ee; but then talking merrily enough, he catch'd his Words back; but hark ye, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> now I think on't, how &s;hall I be &s;atisfied it is not a Man-bed-fellow? O, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> I dare &s;ay your Lord&s;hip is &s;atisfy'd 'tis poor <HI>A|my;</HI> yes, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> 'tis Mrs. <HI>Amy,</HI> but how do I know what <HI>Amy</HI> is? It may be Mr. <HI>Amy,</HI> for ought I know; I hope you'll give me Leave to be &s;atisfy'd: I told him, Yes, by all Means I would have his Lord&s;hip &s;atisfied, but I &s;uppo&s;ed he knew who &s;he was.</P>
<P>Well, he fell foul of poor <HI>Amy,</HI> and indeed I thought once he would have carryed the Je&s;t on before my Face, as was once done in a like Ca&s;e; but his Lord&s;hip was not &s;o hot neither; but he would know whether <HI>Amy</HI> was Mr. <HI>Amy</HI> or Mrs. <HI>Amy,</HI> and &s;o I &s;uppo&s;e he did;
<PB N="197" REF="195">
and then being &s;atisfy'd in that doubtful Ca&s;e, he walk|ed to the farther End of the Room, and went into a little Clo&s;er and &s;at down.</P>
<P>In the mean Time <HI>Amy</HI> and I got up, and I bid her run and make the Bed in another Chamber for my Lord, and I gave her Sheets to put into it; which &s;he did im|mediately, and I put my Lord to Bed there; and when I had done, at his De&s;ire, went to Bed to him. I was backward at fir&s;t to come to Bed to him, and made my Excu&s;e, becau&s;e I had been in Bed with <HI>Amy,</HI> and had not &s;hifted me, but he was pa&s;t tho&s;e Niceties at that Time; and as long as he was &s;ure it was Mrs. <HI>Amy,</HI> and not Mr. <HI>Amy,</HI> he was very well &s;atisfied, and &s;o the Je&s;t pa&s;s'd over; but <HI>Amy</HI> appeared no more all that Night, or the next Day, and when &s;he did my Lord was &s;o merry with her upon his <HI>Eclairci&s;&s;ment,</HI> as he call'd it, that <HI>Amy</HI> did not know what to do with her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Not that <HI>Amy</HI> was &s;uch a Nice Lady in the main, if &s;he had been fairly dealt with, as has appeared in the former Part of this Work; but now &s;he was &s;urpriz'd, and a little hurried, that &s;he &s;carce knew where &s;he was; and be&s;ides, &s;he was, as to his Lord&s;hip, as nice a Lady as any in the World, and for any Thing he knew of her, &s;he appeared as &s;uch. The re&s;t was to us only that knew of it.</P>
<P>I held this wicked Scene of Life out eight Years, rec|koning from my fir&s;t coming to <HI>England;</HI> and tho' my Lord found no Fault, yet I found, without much exa|mining, that any one who look'd in my. Face might &s;ee I was above twenty Years old, and yet without flatter|ing my&s;elf, I carried my Age, which was above fifty, very well too.</P>
<P>I may venture to &s;ay that no Woman ever liv'd a Life like me, of &s;ix and twenty Years of Wickedne&s;s, without the lea&s;t Signals of Remor&s;e, without any Signs of Re|pentance, or without &s;o much as a Wi&s;h to put an End to it; I had &s;o long habituated my&s;elf to a Life of Vice, that really it appeared to be no Vice to me. I went on &s;mooth and plea&s;ant, I wallow'd in Wealth, and $t &s;low'd in upon me at &s;uch a Rate, having taken the $rugal Mea&s;ures that the good Knight directed, that
<PB N="198" REF="196">
I had at the End of the eight Years two thou&s;and eight hundred Pounds coming yearly in, of which I did not &s;pend one Penny, being maintain'd by my Allowance from my Lord&mdash;, and more than maintain'd by above 200 <HI>l.</HI> per <HI>Annum;</HI> for tho' he did not contract for 500 <HI>l.</HI> a Year, as I made dumb Signs to have it be, yet he gave me Money &s;o often, and that in &s;uch large Parcels, that I had &s;eldom &s;o little as &s;even or eight hun|dred Pounds a Year of him, one Year with another.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t go back here, after telling openly the wicked Things I did to mention &s;omething, which however, had the Face of doing Good; I remembered that when I went from <HI>England,</HI> which was fifteen Years before, I had left five little Children, turn'd out, as it were, to the wide World, and the Charity of their Father's Rela|tions; the elde&s;t was not &s;ix Years old, for we had not been marry'd full &s;even Years when their Father went away.</P>
<P>After my coming to <HI>England,</HI> I was greatly de&s;irous to hear how Things &s;tood with them; and whether they were all alive or not, and in what Manner they had been maintain'd; and yet I re&s;olved not to di&s;cover my&s;elf to them in the lea&s;t; or to let any of the People that had the breeding of them up know that there was &s;uch a Body left in the World as their Mother.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was the only Body I could tru&s;t with &s;uch a Com|mi&s;&s;ion, and I &s;ent her into <HI>Spittle-fields,</HI> to the old Aunt, and to the poor Woman that were &s;o in&s;trumental in di&s;po&s;ing the Relations to take &s;ome Care of the Chil|dren, but they were both gone, dead and buried &s;ome Years. The next Enquiry &s;he made was at the Hou&s;e where &s;he carry'd the poor Children, and turn'd them in at the Door; when &s;he came there &s;he found the Hou&s;e inhabited by other People, &s;o that &s;he could make little or nothing of her Enquiries, and came back with an An&s;wer, that indeed was no An&s;wer to me, for it gave me no Satisfaction at all. I &s;ent her back to en|quire in the Neighbourhood, what was become of the Family that liv'd in that Hou&s;e? and if they were re|moved, where they lived? and what Circum&s;tances they were in? and withal, if &s;he could, what became of the
<PB N="199" REF="197">
poor Children, and how they liv'd, and where? how they had been treated? <HI>and the like.</HI></P>
<P>She brought me back Word upon this &s;econd going, that &s;he heard as to the Family, that the Husband, who, tho' but Uncle-in-Law to the Children had yet been kinde&s;t to them, was dead; and that the Widow was left but in mean Circum&s;tances, that is to &s;ay, &s;he did not want, but that &s;he was not &s;o well in the World as &s;he was thought to be when her Husband was alive.</P>
<P>That as to the poor Children, two of them, it &s;eems, had been kept by her, that is to &s;ay, by her Husband, while he liv'd, for that it was again&s;t her Will, that we all knew; but the hone&s;t Neighbours pitied the poor Children, <HI>they &s;aid,</HI> heartily; for that their Aunt us'd them barbarou&s;ly, and made them little better than Ser|vants in the Hou&s;e, to wait upon her and her Children, and &s;carce allow'd them Cloaths fit to wear.</P>
<P>The&s;e were, it &s;eems, my elde&s;t and third, which were Daughters; the &s;econd was a Son, the fourth a Daughter, and the younge&s;t a Son.</P>
<P>To fini&s;h the melancholly Part of this Hi&s;tory of my two unhappy Girls, &s;he brought me Word that &s;o &s;oon as they were able to go out, and get any Work, they went from her; and &s;ome &s;aid &s;he had turned them out of Doors; but it &s;eems &s;he had not done &s;o, but &s;he us'd them &s;o cruelly that they left her; and one of them went to Service to a Neighbour's a little Way off, who knew her, an hone&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial Weaver's Wife, to whom &s;he was Chamber-maid, and in a little Time &s;he took her Si&s;ter out of the <HI>Bridewell</HI> of her Aunt's Hou&s;e, and got her a Place too.</P>
<P>This was all melancholly and dull. I &s;ent her then to the Weaver's Hou&s;e, where the elde&s;t had liv'd, but found that her Mi&s;tre&s;s being dead, &s;he was gone and no Body knew there whither &s;he went, only that they $heard &s;he had liv'd with a great Lady at the other End of the Town; but they did not know who that Lady was.</P>
<P>The&s;e Enquiries took us up three or four Weeks, and I was not one Jot the better for it, for I could hear no|thing to my Satisfaction. I &s;ent her next to find out the
<PB N="200" REF="198">
hone&s;t Man, who, as in the Beginning of my Story I ob&s;erved made them be entertained, and cau&s;ed the younge&s;t to be fetch'd from the Town where we liv'd, and where the Pari&s;h-Officers had taken Care of them. This Gentleman was &s;till alive; and there &s;he heard that my younge&s;t Daughter and elde&s;t Son was dead al|&s;o; but that my younge&s;t Son was alive, and was at that Time about &s;eventeen Years old, and that he was put out Apprentice by the Kindne&s;s and Charity of his Uncle, but to a mean Trade, at which he was obliged to work very hard.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was &s;o curious in this Part, that &s;he went imme|diately to &s;ee him, and found him all dirty, and hard at Work; &s;he had no Remembrance at all of the Youth, for &s;he had not &s;een him &s;ince he was about two Years old; and it was evident he could have no Know|ledge of her.</P>
<P>However, &s;he talked with him, and found him a good &s;en&s;ible mannerly Youth; that he knew little of the Story of his Father or Mother, and had no View of any Thing, but to work hard for his Living; and &s;he did not think fit to put any great Things into his Head, le&s;t it &s;hould take him off of his Bu&s;ine&s;s, and perhaps make him turn giddy-headed, and be good for nothing; but &s;he went and found out that kind Man, his Benefactor, who had put him out; and finding him a plain well-meaning, hone&s;t, and kind-hearted Man, &s;he opened her Tale to him the ea&s;ier: She made a long Story, how &s;he had a prodigious Kindne&s;s for the Child, becau&s;e &s;he had the &s;ame for his Father and Mother; told him that &s;he was the Servant-maid that brought all of them to their Aunt's Door, and run away and left them; that their poor Mother wanted Bread, and what came of her after &s;he would have been glad to know; &s;he added, that her Circum&s;tances had happened to mend in the World; and that, as &s;he was in Condition, &s;o &s;he was di&s;po&s;ed to &s;hew &s;ome Kinnde&s;s to the Children, if &s;he could find them out.</P>
<P>He received her with all the Civility that &s;o kind a Propo&s;al demanded; gave her an Account what he had done for the Child, how he had maintain'd him, fe$
<PB N="201" REF="199">
and cloath'd him, put him to School, and at la&s;t, put him out to a Trade; &s;he &s;aid, he had indeed been a Fa|ther to the Child; but Sir, &s;ays &s;he, 'tis a very labo|rious hard-working Trade, and he is but a thin weak Boy; that's true, &s;ays he, but the Boy cho&s;e the Trade, and I a&s;&s;ure you, I gave 20 <HI>l.</HI> with him, and am to find him Cloaths all his Apprentice&s;hip; and as to its being a hard Trade, &s;ays he, that's the Fate of his Circum&s;tances, poor Boy; I cou'd not well do better for him.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, as you did all for him in Charity, &s;ays &s;he, it was exceeding well; but as my Re&s;olution is to do &s;omething for him, I de&s;ire you will, if po&s;&s;ible, take him away again from that Place, where he works &s;o hard, for I cannot bear to &s;ee the Child work &s;o very hard for his Bread, and I will do &s;omething for him, that &s;hall make him live without &s;uch hard Labour.</P>
<P>He &s;mil'd at that; I can indeed, &s;ays he, take him away, but then I mu&s;t lo&s;e my 20 <HI>l.</HI> that I gave with him.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Amy,</HI> I'll enable you to lo&s;e that 20 <HI>l.</HI> immediately, and &s;o &s;he put her Hand in her Pocket, and pulls out her Pur&s;e.</P>
<P>He begun to be a little amaz'd at her, and look'd her hard in the Face, and that &s;o very much, that &s;he took Notice of it, and &s;aid, Sir, I fancy by your looking at me, you think you know me, but I am a&s;|&s;ured you do not, for I never &s;aw your Face before; I think you have done enough for the Child, and that you ought to be acknowledg'd as a Father to him, but you ought not to lo&s;e by your Kindne&s;s to him, more than the Kindne&s;s of bringing him up obliges you to; and therefore there's the twenty Pounds, added &s;he, and pray let him be &s;etch'd away.</P>
<P>Well, Madam, &s;ays he, I will thank you for the Boy, as well as for my&s;elf; but will you plea&s;e to tell me what I mu&s;t do with him.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;ays <HI>Amy,</HI> as you have been &s;o kind to keep him &s;o many Years, I beg you will take him home again one Year more, and I'll bring you an hundred
<PB N="202" REF="200">
Pounds more, which I will de&s;ire you to lay out in Schooling and Cloaths for him, and to pay you for his Board; perhaps I may put him in a Condition to re|turn your Kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>He look'd pleas'd, but &s;urpriz'd very much, and enquir'd of <HI>Amy,</HI> but with very great Re&s;pect, what he &s;hould go to School to learn? and what Trade &s;he would plea&s;e to put him out to?</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> &s;aid, he &s;hould put him to learn a little <HI>Latin,</HI> and then Merchants Accounts, and to write a good Hand, for &s;he would have him be put to a <HI>Turky</HI> Merchant.</P>
<P>Madam, &s;ays he, I am glad for his &s;ake, to hear you talk &s;o; but do you know that a <HI>Turkey</HI> Merchant will not take him under 4 or 500 Pounds.</P>
<P>Yes, Sir, &s;ays <HI>Amy,</HI> I know it very well.</P>
<P>And, &s;ays he, that it will require as many thou&s;ands to &s;et him up.</P>
<P>Yes, Sir, &s;ays <HI>Amy,</HI> I know that very well too; and re&s;olving to talk very big, &s;he added, I have no Child|dren of my own, and I re&s;olve to make him my Heir; and if ten thou&s;and Pounds be requir'd to &s;et him up, he &s;hall not want it; I was but his Mother's Servant when he was born, and I mourn'd heartily for the Di&s;|after of the Family; and I always &s;aid, if ever I was worth any Thing in the World, I wou'd take the Child for my own, and I'll be as good as my Word now, tho' I did not then fore&s;ee that it wou'd be with me, as it has been &s;ince: And &s;o <HI>Amy</HI> told him a long Story how &s;he was troubled for me; and what &s;he wou'd give to hear whether I was dead or alive, and what Circum&s;tances I was in; that if &s;he cou'd but find me, if I was ever &s;o poor, &s;he wou'd take Care of me, and make a Gen|tlewoman of me again.</P>
<P>He told her, that as to the Child's Mother, &s;he had been reduc'd to the la&s;t Extremity, and was oblig'd (as he &s;uppos'd &s;he knew) to &s;end the Children all among her Husband's Friends; and if it had not been for him, they had been all &s;ent to the Pari&s;h; but that he oblig'd the other Relations to &s;hare the Charge among them;
<PB N="203" REF="201">
that he had taken two, whereof he had lo&s;t the elde&s;t, who died of the Small-Pox; but that he had been as careful of this, as of his own, and had made very little Difference in their breeding up; only that when he came to put him out, he thought it be&s;t for the Boy, to put him to a Trade which he might &s;et up in with|out a Stock, for otherwi&s;e his Time wou'd be lo&s;t; and that as to his Mother, he had never been able to hear one Word of her, no, not tho' he had made the utmo&s;t Enquiry after her; that there went a Report, that &s;he had drowned her&s;elf; but that he cou'd never meet with any body that cou'd give him a certain Account of it.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> counterfeited a Cry for her poor Mi&s;tre&s;s; told him, &s;he wou'd give any Thing in the World to &s;ee her, if &s;he was alive; and a great deal more &s;uch like Talk they had about that; then they return'd to &s;peak of the Boy.</P>
<P>He enquired of her, why &s;he did not &s;eek after the Child before, that he might have been brought up from a younger Age, &s;uitable to what &s;he de&s;ign'd to do for him.</P>
<P>She told him, &s;he had been out of <HI>England,</HI> and was but newly return'd from the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI> That &s;he had been out of <HI>England,</HI> and was but newly return'd, was true, but the latter was fal&s;e, and was put in to blind him, and to provide again&s;t farther Enquiries; for it was not a &s;trange Thing for young Women to go away poor to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> and come Home va&s;tly rich; &s;o &s;he went on with Directions about him, and both agreed in this, that the Boy &s;hould by no Means be told what was intended for him, but only that he &s;hould be taken home again to his Uncle's, that his Uncle thought the Trade too hard for him, and the like.</P>
<P>About three Days after this, <HI>Amy</HI> goes again, and carry'd him the hundred Pounds &s;he promis'd him, but then <HI>Amy</HI> made quite another Figure than &s;he did be|fore; for &s;he went in my Coach, with two Footmen after her, and dre&s;s'd very fine al&s;o, with Jewels and a Gold Watch; and there was indeed, no great Difficul|ty
<PB N="204" REF="202">
to make <HI>Amy</HI> look like a Lady, for &s;he was a very hand&s;ome well-&s;hap'd Woman, and genteel enough; the Coachmen and Servants were particularly order'd to &s;how her the &s;ame Re&s;pect as they wou'd to me, and to call her Madam <HI>Collins,</HI> if they were ask'd any Que&s;tions about her.</P>
<P>When the Gentleman &s;aw what a Figure &s;he made, it added to the former Surprize, and he entertain'd her in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful Manner po&s;&s;ible; congratulated her Advancement in Fortune, and particularly rejoic'd that it &s;hould fall to the poor Child's Lot to be &s;o pro|vided for, contrary to all Expectation.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>Amy</HI> talk'd big, but very free and familiar; told them &s;he had no Pride in her good Fortune; (that was true enough, for to give <HI>Amy</HI> her due, &s;he was far from it, and was as good humour'd a Creature as ever liv'd) that &s;he was the &s;ame as ever, and that &s;he al|ways lov'd this Boy, and was re&s;olv'd to do &s;omething extraordinary for him.</P>
<P>Then &s;he pull'd out her Money, and paid him down an hundred and twenty Pounds, which, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he gave him, that he might be &s;ure he &s;hould be no Lo&s;er by taking him Home again, and that &s;he would come and &s;ee him again, and talk farther about Things with him, that &s;o all might be &s;ettled for him, in &s;uch a Manner, as the Accidents, &s;uch as Mortality, or any Thing el&s;e, &s;hould make no Alteration to the Child's Prejudice.</P>
<P>At this Meeting, the Uncle brought his Wife out, a good motherly, comely, grave Woman, who &s;poke very tenderly of the Youth, and as it appear'd, had been very good to him, tho' &s;he had &s;everal Children of her own: After a long Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;he put in a Word of her own, Madam, &s;ays &s;he, I am heartily glad of the good Intentions you have for this poor Orphan, and $Span$ &s;incerely in it for his &s;ake; but Madam, you know, (I &s;uppo&s;e) that there are two Si&s;ters alive too, may we not &s;peak a Word for them? <HI>poor Girls, &s;ay &s;he,</HI> they have not been &s;o kindly us'd, as he has, and are turn'd out to the wide World.</P>
<P>Where are they, Madam? <HI>&s;ays Amy,</HI></P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="203">
Poor Creatures, <HI>&s;ays the Gentlewoman,</HI> they are out at Service; no Body knows where but them&s;elves; their Ca&s;e is very hard.</P>
<P>Well, Madam, &s;ays <HI>Amy,</HI> tho', if I cou'd but find them, I wou'd a&s;&s;i&s;t them; yet my Concern is for my Boy, as I call him, and I will put him in a Condition to take care of his Si&s;ters.</P>
<P>But, Madam, &s;ays the good compa&s;&s;ionate Creature, he may not be &s;o charitable perhaps, by his own Incli|nation, for Brothers are not Fathers; and they have been cruelly us'd already, poor Girls; we have often reliev'd them, both with Victuals and Cloaths too, even while they were pretended to be kept by their barbarous Aunt.</P>
<P>Well, Madam, &s;ays <HI>Amy,</HI> what can I do for them; they are gone, it &s;eems, and cannot be heard of? When I &s;ee them, 'tis Time enough.</P>
<P>She pre&s;s'd <HI>Amy</HI> then, to oblige their Brother, out of the plentiful Fortune he was like to have to do &s;omething for his Si&s;ters, when he &s;hould be able.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> &s;poke coldly of that &s;till, but &s;aid, &s;he would con&s;ider of it; and &s;o they parted for that Time; they had &s;everal Meetings after this, for <HI>Amy</HI> went to &s;ee her adopted Son, and order'd his Schooling, Cloaths, and other Things, but enjoin'd them not to tell the young Man any Thing, but that they thought the Trade he was at, too hard for him, and they wou'd keep him at Home a little longer, and give him &s;ome Schooling, to fit him for better Bu&s;ine&s;s; and <HI>Amy</HI> appear'd to him as &s;he did before, only as one that had known his Mo|ther, and had &s;ome Kindne&s;s for him.</P>
<P>Thus this Matter pa&s;s'd on for near a Twelve-month, when it happen'd, that one of my Maid Servants hav|ing ask'd <HI>Amy</HI> Leave, for <HI>Amy</HI> was Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Ser|vants, and took and put out &s;uch as &s;he pleas'd; I &s;ay, having ask'd Leave to go into the City, to &s;ee &s;ome Friends, came Home crying bitterly, and in a mo&s;t grievous Agony &s;he was, and continued &s;o &s;everal Days, till <HI>Amy</HI> perceiving the Exce&s;s, and that the
<PB N="206" REF="204">
Maid wou'd certainly cry her&s;elf &s;ick; &s;he took an Opportunity with her, and examin'd her about it.</P>
<P>The Maid told her a long Story, that &s;he had been to &s;ee her Brother, the only Brother &s;he had in the World; and that &s;he knew he was put out Apprentice to a&mdash;; but there had come a Lady in a Coach to his Uncle&mdash;, who had brought him up, and made him take him Home again; and &s;o the Wench run on with the whole Story, ju&s;t as 'tis told above, till &s;he came to that Part that belonged to her&s;elf; and there, &s;ays &s;he, I had not let them know where I liv'd, and the Lady wou'd have taken me, and they &s;ay, wou'd have provided for me too, as &s;he had done for my Bro|ther, but no Body cou'd tell where to find me, and &s;o I have lo&s;t it all, and all the Hopes of being any thing but a poor Servant all my Days; and then the Girl fell a crying.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> &s;aid, what's all this Story? who cou'd this La|dy be? it mu&s;t be &s;ome Trick &s;ure: No, &s;he &s;aid, 'twas not a Trick, for &s;he had made them take her Bro|ther Home from Apprentice, and bought him new Cloaths, and put him to have more Learning; and the Gentlewoman &s;aid &s;he wou'd make him her Heir.</P>
<P>Her Heir! &s;ays <HI>Amy;</HI> what does that amount to; it may be &s;he had nothing to leave him; &s;he might make any body her Heir.</P>
<P>No, no, &s;ays the Girl, &s;he came in a fine Coach and Hor&s;es, and I don't know how many Footmen to at|tend her, and brought a great Bag of Gold, and gave it to my Uncle&mdash;, he that brought up my Brother, to buy him Cloaths, and to pay for his Schooling and Board.</P>
<P>He that brought up your Brother? &s;ays <HI>Amy;</HI> why, did not he bring you up too, as well as your Brother? Pray who brought you up then?</P>
<P>Here the poor Girl told a melancholy Story, how an Aunt had brought up her and her Si&s;ter, and how barbarou&s;ly &s;he had us'd them, as we have heard.</P>
<P>By this Time <HI>Amy</HI> had her Head full enough, and her Heart too; and did not know how to hold it, $Word$ what to do, for &s;he was &s;atisfied that this was no other
<PB N="207" REF="205">
than my own Daughter; for &s;he told her all the Hi&s;to|ry of her Father and Mother; and how &s;he was carried by their Maid to her Aunt's Door, ju&s;t as is related in the beginning of my Story.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> did not tell me this Story for a great while, nor did &s;he well know what Cour&s;e to take in it; but as &s;he had Authority to manage every Thing in the Fa|mily, &s;he took Occa&s;ion &s;ome Time after, without letting me know any Thing of it, to find &s;ome Fault with the Maid, and turn her away.</P>
<P>Her Rea&s;ons were good, tho' at fir&s;t I was not pleas'd when I heard of it, but I was convinc'd afterwards, that &s;he was in the right; for if &s;he had told me of it, I &s;hou'd have been in great Perplexity between the Dif|ficulty of concealing my&s;elf from my own Child, and the Inconvenience of having my Way of Living be known among my fir&s;t Husband's Relations, and even to my Husband him&s;elf; for as to his being dead at <HI>Paris, Amy</HI> &s;eeing me re&s;olv'd again&s;t marrying any more, had told me, that &s;he had form'd that Story only to make me ea&s;y, when I was in <HI>Holland,</HI> if any thing &s;hould offer to my liking.</P>
<P>However, I was too tender a Mother &s;till, notwith|&s;tanding what I had done, to let this poor Girl go about the World drudging, as it were for Bread, and &s;laving at the Fire, and in the Kitchin, as a Cook Maid; be&s;ides it came into my Head, that &s;he might, perhaps, marry &s;ome poor Devil of a Footman, or a Coachman, or &s;ome &s;uch Thing, and be undone that Way, or, which was wor&s;e, be drawn in to lie with &s;ome of that cour&s;e cur&s;ed Kind, and be with Child, and be utterly ruin'd that Way; and in the mid&s;t of all my Pro&s;perity this gave me great Unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>As to &s;ending <HI>Amy</HI> to her, there was no doing that now; for as &s;he had been Servant in the Hou&s;e, &s;he knew <HI>Amy,</HI> as well as <HI>Amy</HI> knew me; and no doubt, tho' I was much out of her Sight, yet &s;he might have had the Curio&s;ity to have peep'd at me, and &s;een me enough to know me again, if I had di&s;cover'd my&s;elf to her;
<PB N="208" REF="206">
&s;o that, in &s;hort, there was nothing to be done that Way.</P>
<P>However, <HI>Amy,</HI> a diligent indefatigable Creature, found out another Woman, and gave her her Errand, and &s;ent her to the hone&s;t Man's Hou&s;e in <HI>Spittle-Fields,</HI> whither &s;he &s;uppos'd the Girl wou'd go, after &s;he was out of her Place; and bade her talk with her, and tell her at a Di&s;tance, that as &s;omething had been done for her Bro|ther, &s;o &s;omething wou'd be done for her too; and that &s;he &s;hou'd not be di&s;couraged, &s;he carried her <HI>20l.</HI> to buy her Cloaths, and bid her not go to Service any more, but think of other Things; that &s;he &s;hou'd take a Lodg|ing in &s;ome good Family, and that &s;he &s;hou'd &s;oon hear further.</P>
<P>The Girl was overjoy'd with this News, you may be &s;ure, and at fir&s;t a little too much elevated with it, and dre&s;s'd her&s;elf very hand&s;omely indeed, and as &s;oon as &s;he had done &s;o, came and paid a Vi&s;it to Madam <HI>Amy,</HI> to let her &s;ee how fine &s;he was: <HI>Amy</HI> congratu|lated her, and wi&s;h'd it might be all as &s;he expected; but admoni&s;h'd her not to be elevated with it too much; told her, Humility was the be&s;t Ornament of a Gen|tlewoman; and a great deal of good Advice &s;he gave her, but di&s;cover'd nothing.</P>
<P>All this was acted in the fir&s;t Years of my &s;etting up my new Figure here in Town, and while the Ma&s;ks and Balls were in Agitation; and <HI>Amy</HI> carried the Affair of &s;etting out my Son into the World, which we were a&s;|&s;i&s;ted in by the &s;age Advice of my faithful Coun&s;ellor Sir <HI>Robert Clayton,</HI> who procur'd us a Ma&s;ter for him, by whom he was afterwards &s;ent Abroad to <HI>Italy,</HI> as you &s;hall hear in its Place; and <HI>Amy</HI> managed my Daughter too very well, tho' by a third hand.</P>
<P>My Amour with my Lord&mdash;began now to draw to an end, and indeed notwith&s;tanding his Money, it had la&s;ted &s;o long, that I was much more &s;ick of his Lord&s;hip, than he cou'd be of me; he grew old, and fretful, and captious, and I mu&s;t add, which made the Vice it&s;elf begin to grow &s;urfeiting and nauceous to me, he grew wor&s;e and wickeder the older he grew, and
<PB N="209" REF="207">
that to &s;uch Degree, as is not fit to write of, and made me &s;o weary of him, that upon one of his capricious Humours, which he often took Occa&s;ion to trouble me with, I took Occa&s;ion to be much le&s;s complai&s;ant to him than I us'd to be; and as I knew him to be ha&s;ty, I fir&s;t took Care to put him into a little Pa&s;&s;ion, and then to re&s;ent it, and this brought us to Words, in which I told him, I thought he grew &s;ick of me; and he an&s;wer'd, in a heat, that truly &s;o he was. I an&s;wer'd, that I found his Lord&s;hip was endeavouring to make me &s;ick too; that I had met with &s;everal &s;uch Rubs from him of late; and that he did not u&s;e me as he was won't to do; and I begg'd his Lord&s;hip, he wou'd make him&s;elf ea&s;y: This I &s;poke with an Air of Coldne&s;s and Indifference, &s;uch as I knew he could not bear; but I did not downright quarrel with him, and tell him I was &s;ick of him too, and de&s;ire him to quit me, for I knew that wou'd come of it&s;elf; be&s;ides, I had receiv'd a great deal of hand&s;ome U&s;age from him, and I was loth to have the Breach be on my Side, that he might not be able to &s;ay I was ungrateful.</P>
<P>But he put the Occa&s;ion into my Hands, for he came no more to me for two Months; indeed I expected a Fit of Ab&s;ence, for &s;uch I had had &s;everal Times be|fore, but not for above a Fortnight or three Weeks at mo&s;t: But after I had &s;taid a Month, which was lon|ger than ever he kept away yet, I took a new Method with him, for I was re&s;olv'd now it &s;hou'd be in my Power to continue, or not, as I thought fit. At the End of a Month therefore, I remov'd, and took Lodg|ings at <HI>Ken&s;ington Gravil Pits,</HI> and that Part next to the Road to <HI>Acton,</HI> and left no Body in my Lodgings but <HI>Amy</HI> and the Footman, with proper In&s;tructions how to behave, when his Lord&s;hip being come to him&s;elf, &s;hou'd think fit to come again, which I knew he wou'd.</P>
<P>About the End of two Months, he came in the Dusk of the Evening, as u&s;ual; the Footman an&s;wer'd him, and told him, his Lady was not at home, but there was Mrs. <HI>Amy</HI> above; &s;o he did not order her to be call'd down, but went up Stairs into the Dining Room,
<PB N="210" REF="208">
and Mrs. <HI>Amy</HI> came to him; he ask'd where I was? My Lord, &s;aid &s;he, my Mi&s;tre&s;s has been remov'd a a good while from hence, and lives at <HI>Ken&s;ington:</HI> Ay, Mrs. <HI>Amy!</HI> how come you to be here then! My Lord, &s;aid &s;he, we are here till the Quarter-Day, be|cau&s;e the Goods are not remov'd, and to give An&s;wer, if any comes to ask for my Lady: Well, and what An&s;wer are you to give to me? Indeed, my Lord, &s;ays <HI>Amy,</HI> I have no particular An&s;wer to your Lord|&s;hip, but to tell you, and every body el&s;e, where my Lady lives, that they may not think &s;he's run away, No, Mrs. <HI>Amy,</HI> &s;ays he, I don't think &s;he's run away, but indeed, I can't go after her &s;o far as that. <HI>Amy</HI> &s;aid nothing to that, but made a Curt'&s;y, and &s;aid, &s;he be|liev'd I wou'd be there again for a Week or two, in a little Time: How little time, Mrs. <HI>Amy? &s;ays my Lord:</HI> She comes next <HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Amy:</HI> Very well, <HI>&s;ays my Lord,</HI> I will call and &s;ee her then; and &s;o he went away.</P>
<P>Accordingly I came on the <HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> and &s;taid a Fort|night, but he came not; &s;o I went back to <HI>Ken&s;ington,</HI> and after that, I had very few of his Lord&s;hip's Vi&s;its, which I was very glad of, and in a little Time after was more glad of it, than I was at fir&s;t, and upon a far better Account too.</P>
<P>For now I began not to be &s;ick of his Lord&s;hip only, but really I began to be &s;ick of the Vice; and as I had good Lei&s;ure now to divert and enjoy my&s;elf in the World, as much as it was po&s;&s;ible for any Woman to do, that ever liv'd in it; &s;o I found that my Judgment began to prevail upon me to fix my Delight upon nobler Objects than I had formerly done; and the very beginning of this brought &s;ome ju&s;t Reflections upon me, relating to Things pa&s;t, and to the former Manner of my living; and tho' there was not the lea&s;t Hint in all this, from what may be call'd Religion or Con&s;cience, and far from any Thing of Repentance, or any Thing that was a-kin to it, e&s;pecially at fir&s;t; yet the Sen&s;e of Things, and the Knowledge I had of the World, and the va&s;t Variety of Scenes that I had acted my Part in,
<PB N="211" REF="209">
began to work upon my Sen&s;es, and it came &s;o very &s;trong upon my Mind one Morning, when I had been lying awake &s;ome Time in my Bed, as if &s;omebody had ask'd me the Que&s;tion, <HI>What was I a Whore for now?</HI> It occurr'd naturally upon this Enquiry, that at fir&s;t I yielded to the Importunity of my Circum&s;tances, the Mi&s;ery of which, the Devil di&s;mally aggravated, to draw me to comply; for I confe&s;s I had &s;trong natural Aver&s;ions to the Crime at fir&s;t, partly owing to a virtu|ous Education, and partly to a Sen&s;e of Religion; but the Devil, and that greater Devil of Poverty prevail'd; and the Per&s;on who laid Siege to me, did it in &s;uch an obliging, and I may almo&s;t &s;ay, irre&s;i&s;tible Manner, all &s;till manag'd by the evil Spirit, for I mu&s;t be allowed to believe, that he has a Share in all &s;uch Things, if not the whole Management of them: But, I &s;ay, it was carried on by that Per&s;on, in &s;uch an irre&s;i&s;tible Man|ner, that (as I &s;aid) when I related the Fact, there was no with&s;tanding it: The&s;e Circum&s;tances, I &s;ay, the Devil manag'd, not only to bring me to comply, but he continued them as Arguments to fortify my Mind a|gain&s;t all Reflection, and to keep me in that horrid Cour&s;e I had engaged in, as if it were hone&s;t and lawful.</P>
<P>But not to dwell upon that now; this was a Pretence and here was &s;omething to be &s;aid, tho' I acknowledge, it ought not to have been &s;ufficient to me at all; but, I &s;ay, to leave that, all this was out of Doors; the De|vil him&s;elf could not form one Argument, or put one Rea&s;on into my Head <HI>now,</HI> that could &s;erve for an An|&s;wer, no, not &s;o much as a pretended An&s;wer to this Que&s;tion, <HI>Why I &s;hould be a Whore now?</HI></P>
<P>It had for a while been a little kind of Excu&s;e to me, that I was engaged with this wicked old Lord, and that I could not in Honour for&s;ake him; but how fooli&s;h and ab&s;urd did it look to repeat the Word <HI>Honour</HI> on &s;o vile an Occa&s;ion? as if a Woman &s;hould pro&s;titute her Ho|nour in Point of Honour; horrid Incon&s;i&s;tency! Honour call'd upon me to dete&s;t the Crime and the Man too, and to have re&s;i&s;ted all the Attacks which from the Be|ginning had been made upon my Virtue; and Honour,
<PB N="212" REF="210">
had it been con&s;ulted, would have pre&s;erved me hone&s;t from the Beginning.</P>
<P>For HONESTY and HONOUR are the &s;ame.</P>
<P>This, however, &s;hews us with what faint Excu&s;es, and with what Trifles we pretend to &s;atisfy our&s;elves, and &s;uppre&s;s the Attempts of Con&s;cience in the Pur&s;uit of a|greeable Crime, and in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing tho&s;e Plea&s;ures which we are loth to part with.</P>
<P>But this Objection would now &s;erve no longer; for my Lord had, in &s;ome Sort, broke his Engagements <HI>(I won't call it Honour again)</HI> with me, and had &s;o far &s;lighted me as fairly to ju&s;tify my entire quitting of him now; and &s;o, as the Objection was fully an&s;wered, the Que&s;ti|on remained &s;till unan&s;wered, <HI>Why am I a Whore now?</HI> Nor indeed had I any Thing to &s;ay for my&s;elf, <HI>even to my&s;elf;</HI> I could not without blu&s;hing, as wicked as I was, an&s;wer, that I lov'd it for the Sake of the Vice, and that I delighted in being a Whore, <HI>as &s;uch;</HI> I &s;ay, I could not &s;ay this, even to my&s;elf, <HI>and all alone,</HI> nor in|deed would it have been true. I was never able in Ju&s;|tice, and with Truth, to &s;ay I was &s;o wicked as that; but as Nece&s;&s;ity fir&s;t debauched me, and Poverty made me a Whore at the Beginning; &s;o Exce&s;s of Avance for getting Money, and Exce&s;s of Vanity, continued me in the Crime, not being able to re&s;i&s;t the Flatteries of great Per&s;ons; being call'd the fine&s;t Woman in <HI>France;</HI> be|ing care&s;s'd by a Prince; and afterwards I had Pride e|nough to expect, and Folly enough to believe, tho' in|deed without Ground, by a great Monarch: The&s;e were my Baits, the&s;e the Chains by which the Devil held me bound; and by which I was indeed too fa&s;t held for any Rea&s;oning that I was then Mi&s;tre&s;s of to deliver me from.</P>
<P>But this was all over now; Avarice could have no Pretence; I was out of the Reach of all that Fate could do to reduce me; now I was &s;o far from Poor, or the Danger of it, that I had fifty thou&s;and Pounds in my Pocket at lea&s;t; nay, I had the Income of fifty thou|&s;and Pounds; for I had 2500 <HI>l.</HI> a Year coming in upon
<PB N="213" REF="211">
very good Land-&s;ecurity, be&s;ides three or four thou&s;and Pounds in Money, which I kept by me for ordinary Oc|ca&s;ions, and be&s;ides Jewels and Plate, and Goods, which were worth near 5600 <HI>l.</HI> more; the&s;e put together, when I ruminated on it all in my Thoughts, as you may be &s;ure I did often, added Weight &s;till to the Que&s;tion, as above, and it &s;ounded continually in my Head, what's next? <HI>What am I a Whore for now?</HI></P>
<P>It is true, this was, as I &s;ay, &s;eldom out of my Thoughts, but yet it made no Impre&s;&s;ions upon me of that Kind which might be expected from a Reflection of &s;o important a Nature, and which had &s;o much of Sub|&s;tance and Seriou&s;ne&s;s in it.</P>
<P>But however, it was not without &s;ome little Con&s;e|quences, even at that Time, and which gave a little Turn to my Way of Living at fir&s;t, as you &s;hall hear in its Place.</P>
<P>But one particular Thing interven'd be&s;ides this, which gave me &s;ome Unea&s;ine&s;s at this Time, and made Way for other Things that followed. I have mentioned in &s;everal little Digre&s;&s;ions, the Concern I had upon me for my Children, and in what Manner I had directed that Affair; I mu&s;t go on a little with that Part, in order to bring the &s;ub&s;equent Parts of my Story together.</P>
<P>My Boy, the only Son I had left, that I had a legal Right to call Son, was, <HI>as I have &s;aid,</HI> re&s;cued from the un|happy Circum&s;tances of being Apprentice to a Mechanic, and was brought up upon a new Foot; but tho' this was infinitely to his Advantage, yet it put him back near three Years in his coming into the World, for he had been near a Year at the Drudgery he was fir&s;t put to, and it took up two Years more to form him for what he had Hopes given him he &s;hould hereafter be, &s;o that he was full nineteen Years old, or rather twenty Years, be|fore he came to be put out as I intended; at the End of which Time I put him to a very flouri&s;hing <HI>Italian</HI> Mer|chant, and he again &s;ent him to <HI>Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> in the I&s;land of <HI>Sicily;</HI> and a little before the Juncture I am now &s;peak|ing of, I had Letters from him, that is to &s;ay, Mrs. <HI>A|my</HI> had Letters from him, intimating that he was out of his Time, and that he had an Opportunity to be taken
<PB N="214" REF="212">
into an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hou&s;e there, on very good Terms, if his Support from hence might an&s;wer what he was bid to hope for; and &s;o begg'd that what would be done for him might be &s;o ordered that he might have it for his pre&s;ent Advancement, referring for the Particulars to his Ma&s;ter, the Merchant in <HI>London,</HI> whom he had been put Apprentice to here; who, to cut the Story &s;hort, gave &s;uch a &s;atisfactory Account of it, and of my young Man, to my &s;teddy and faithful Coun&s;ellor Sir <HI>Robert Clayton,</HI> that I made no Scruple to pay 4000 <HI>l.</HI> which was 1000 <HI>l.</HI> more than he demanded, or rather propo&s;ed, that he might have Encouragement to enter into the World bet|ter than he expected.</P>
<P>His Ma&s;ter remitted the Money very faithfully to him, and finding by Sir <HI>Robert Clayton,</HI> that the young Gen|tleman, for &s;o he call'd him, was well &s;upported, wrote &s;uch Letters on his Account, as gave him a Credit a$ <HI>Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> equal in Value to the Money it&s;elf.</P>
<P>I could not dige&s;t it very well, that I &s;hould all this while conceal my&s;elf thus from my own Child, and make all this Favour due, in his Opinion, to a Stranger and yet I could not find in my Heart to let my Son know what a Mother he had, and what a Life &s;he liv'd; when at the &s;ame Time that he mu&s;t think him&s;elf infinitely obliged to me, he mu&s;t be oblig'd, if he was a Man of Virtue, to hate his Mother, and abhor the Way of Liv+ing, by which all the Bounty he enjoyed was rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>This is the Rea&s;on of mentioning this Part of my Son'$ Story, which is otherwi&s;e no Ways concerned in my Hi+&s;tory, but as it put me upon thinking how to put an End to that wicked Cour&s;e I was in, that my own Child, when he &s;hould afterwards come to <HI>England</HI> in a good Figure and with the Appearance of a Merchant, &s;hould not be a&s;ham'd to own me.</P>
<P>But there was another Difficulty, which lay heavie upon me a great deal, and that was, my Daughter$ who, as before, I had relieved by the Hands of another In&s;trument, which <HI>Amy</HI> had procur'd: The Girl, as $ have mentioned, was directed to put her&s;elf into a good Garb, take Lodgings, and entertain a Maid to wait up+on her, and to give her&s;elf &s;ome Breeding, that is to &s;ay
<PB N="215" REF="213">
$o learn to dance, and fit her&s;elf to appear as a Gentle|woman; being made to hope, that &s;he &s;hould, &s;ometime or other, find that &s;he &s;hould be put into a Condition to &s;upport her Character, and to make her&s;elf amends for all her former Troubles; &s;he was only charged not to be drawn into Matrimony, till &s;he was &s;ecur'd of a For|tune that might a&s;&s;i&s;t to di&s;po&s;e of her&s;elf &s;uitable not to what &s;he then was, but what &s;he was to be.</P>
<P>The Girl was too &s;en&s;ible of her Circum&s;tances, not to give all po&s;&s;ible Satisfaction of that Kind, and indeed &s;he was Mi&s;tre&s;s of too much Under&s;tanding, not to &s;ee how much &s;he &s;hould be oblig'd to that Part for her own Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>It was not long after this, but being well equipped, and in every Thing well &s;et out, as &s;he was directed, he came, as I have related above, and paid a Vi&s;it to Mrs. <HI>Amy,</HI> and to tell her of her good Fortune. <HI>Amy</HI> $$etended to be much &s;urpriz'd at the Alteration, and $erjoy'd for her Sake, and began to treat her very well, $ntertain'd her hand&s;omely, and when &s;he would have $one away, pretended to ask my Leave, and &s;ent my Coach Home with her; and in &s;hort, learning from her where &s;he lodg'd, which was in the City, <HI>Amy</HI> promis'd $o return her Vi&s;it, and did &s;o; and in a Word, <HI>Amy</HI> $nd SUSAN (for &s;he was my own Name) began an $$timate Acquaintance together.</P>
<P>There was an inexpre&s;&s;ible Difficulty in the poor Girl's $ay, or el&s;e I &s;hould not have been able to have for|$$$ di&s;covering my&s;elf to her, and this was, her hav|$$g been a Servant in my particular Family; and I could $$ no Means think of ever letting the Children know $hat a kind of Creature they ow'd their Being to, or $$ving them an Occa&s;ion to upbraid their Mother with $$r &s;candalous Life, much le&s;s to ju&s;tify the like Practice $$om my Example.</P>
<P>Thus it was with me; and thus, no doubt, con&s;ider|$$g Parents always find it, that their own Children are Re&s;traint to them in their wor&s;t Cour&s;es, when the $a&s;e of a &s;uperior Power has not the &s;ame Influence: $$ <HI>of that hereafter.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="214">
There happened however, one good Circum&s;tance the Ca&s;e of this poor Girl, which brought about a Di&s;+covery &s;ooner than otherwi&s;e it would have been; and i was thus: After &s;he and <HI>Amy</HI> had been intimate for &s;ome Time, and had exchang'd &s;everal Vi&s;its, the Girl now grown a Woman, talking to <HI>Amy</HI> of the gay Thing that us'd to fall out when &s;he was Servant in my Family &s;poke of it with a kind of Concern, that &s;he could no$ &s;ee <HI>[me]</HI> her Lady; and at la&s;t &s;he adds, <HI>'twas very &s;trange, Madam,</HI> &s;ay &s;he to <HI>Amy,</HI> but tho' I lived nea$ two Years in the Hou&s;e, I never &s;aw my Mi&s;tre&s;s in my Life, except it was that public Night when &s;he danc'd in the fine <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Habit, and then &s;he was &s;o di&s;guis'd that I knew nothing of her afterwards.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was glad to hear this; but as &s;he was a cunning Girl from the Beginning, &s;he was not to be bit, and $Word$ &s;he laid no Stre&s;s upon that at fir&s;t, but gave me a$ Account of it; and, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, it gave me a &s;e+cret Joy, to think that I was not known to her; an$ that, by Virtue of that only Accident, I might, who other Circum&s;tances made Room for it, di&s;cover my&s;e$$ to her, and let her know &s;he had a Mother in a Cond$+tion fit to be own'd.</P>
<P>It was a dreadful Re&s;traint to me before, and this ga$$ me &s;ome very &s;ad Reflections, and made way for t$ great Que&s;tion I have mentioned above; and by he much the Circum&s;tance was bitter to me, by &s;o much the more agreeable it was, to under&s;tand that the $Word$ had never &s;een me, and con&s;equently, did not know $$ again, if &s;he was to be told who I was.</P>
<P>However, the next Time &s;he came to vi&s;it <HI>Amy,</HI> I w$$ re&s;olved to put it to a Tryal, and to come into the Roo$ and let her &s;ee me, and to &s;ee by that, whether $$ knew me or no; but <HI>Amy</HI> put me by, le&s;t indeed, as th$ was Rea&s;on enough to que&s;tion, I &s;hould not be able contain, or forbear di&s;covering my&s;elf to her; &s;o it w$$ off for that Time.</P>
<P>But both the&s;e Circum&s;tances, and that is the Rea$ of my mentioning them, brought me to con&s;ider of Life I liv'd, and to re&s;olve to put my&s;elf into &s;ome$+gure of Life, in which I might not be &s;candalous to

<P>There was another Daughter I had, which, with all our Enquiries we could not hear of, high nor low, for &s;everal Years after the fir&s;t. But I return to my own Story.</P>
<P>Being now in Part remov'd from my old Station, I &s;eem'd to be in a fair Way of retiring from my old Ac|quaintances, and con&s;equently from the vile abomi|nable Trade I had driven &s;o long; &s;o that the Door &s;eem'd to be, as it were, particularly opened to my Re|formation, if I had any Mind to it in earne&s;t; but for all that, &s;ome of my old Friends, as I us'd to call them, enquir'd me out, and came to vi&s;it me at <HI>Ken&s;ington,</HI> and that more frequently than I wi&s;h'd they would do; but it being once known where I was, there was no avoiding it, unle&s;s I would have downright refu&s;ed and affronted them; and I was not yet in earne&s;t enough with my Re&s;olutions to go that Length.</P>
<P>The be&s;t of it was, my old lewd Favourite, whom I now heartily hated, entirely dropt me; he came once to vi&s;it me, but I cau&s;ed <HI>Amy</HI> to deny me, and &s;ay I was gone out; &s;he did it &s;o oddly too, that when his Lord|&s;hip went away, he &s;aid coldly to her, Well, well, Mrs. <HI>Amy,</HI> I find your Mi&s;tre&s;s does not de&s;ire to be &s;een; tell her I won't trouble her <HI>any more,</HI> repeating the Words <HI>any more</HI> two or three Times over, ju&s;t at his going away.</P>
<P>I reflected a little on it at fir&s;t, as unkind to him, hav|ing had &s;o many con&s;iderable Pre&s;ents from him, but, <HI>as I have &s;aid,</HI> I was &s;ick of him, and that on &s;ome Accounts, which if I cou'd &s;uffer my&s;elf to publi&s;h them, wou'd fully ju&s;tify my Conduct; but that Part of the Story will not bear telling; &s;o I mu&s;t leave it, and proceed.</P>
<P>I had begun a little, <HI>as I have &s;aid above,</HI> to reflect upon my Manner of Living, and to think of putting a new Face upon it; and nothing mov'd me to it more than the Con&s;ideration of my having three Children, who were now grown up; and yet, that while I was in that Station of Life, I could not conver&s;e with them, or
<PB N="218" REF="216">
make my&s;elf known to them; and this gave me a great deal of Unea&s;ine&s;s; at la&s;t I enter'd into Talk on this Part of it with my Woman <HI>Amy.</HI></P>
<P>We liv'd at <HI>Ken&s;ington, as I have &s;aid,</HI> and though I had done with my old wicked L&mdash;, as above, yet I was frequently vi&s;ited, <HI>as I &s;aid,</HI> by &s;ome others, &s;o that, in a Word, I began to be known in the Town, not by my Name only, but my Character too, which was wor&s;e.</P>
<P>It was one Morning when <HI>Amy</HI> was in Bed with me, and I had &s;ome of my dulle&s;t Thoughts about me, that <HI>Amy</HI> hearing me &s;igh pretty often, ask'd me if I was not well? Yes, <HI>Amy,</HI> I am well enough, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> but my Mind is oppre&s;s'd with heavy Thoughts, and has been &s;o a good while; and then I told her how it griev'd me that I could not make my&s;elf known to my own Children, or form any Acquaintances in the World: Why &s;o? <HI>&s;ays</HI> Amy; Why prithee, <HI>Amy, &s;ays I,</HI> what will my Children &s;ay to them&s;elves, and to one another, when they find their Mother, however rich &s;he may be, is at be&s;t but a Whore, a common Whore? And as for Acquaintance, prithee <HI>Amy,</HI> what &s;ober Lady, or what Family of any Character will vi&s;it or be acquainted with a Whore?</P>
<P>Why, all that's true, Madam, <HI>&s;ays</HI> Amy; but how can it be remedy'd now? 'Tis true, <HI>Amy, &s;aid I,</HI> the Thing cannot be remedy'd now, but the Scandal of it, I fancy, may be thrown off.</P>
<P>Truly, &s;ays <HI>Amy,</HI> I don't &s;ee how, unle&s;s you will go abroad again, and live in &s;ome other Nation, where no Body has known us, or &s;een us, &s;o that they cannot &s;ay they ever &s;aw us before.</P>
<P>That very Thought of <HI>Amy</HI> put what follows into my Head; and I returned, Why <HI>Amy, &s;ays I,</HI> is it not po&s;&s;ible for me to &s;hift my Being, from this Part of the Town, and go and live in another Part of the City, or another Part of the Country, and be as entirely con|ceal'd as if I had never been known?</P>
<P>Yes, <HI>&s;ays</HI> Amy, I believe it might; but then you mu&s;t put off all your Equipages, and Servants, Coaches
<PB N="219" REF="217">
and Hor&s;es; change your Liveries, nay, your own Cloaths, and if it was po&s;&s;ible your very Face.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> and that's the Way, <HI>Amy,</HI> and that I'll do, and that forthwith; for I am not able to live in this Manner any longer: <HI>Amy</HI> came into this with a kind of Plea&s;ure particular to her&s;elf, that is to &s;ay, with an Eagerne&s;s not to be re&s;i&s;ted; for <HI>Amy</HI> was apt to be precipitant in her Motions, and was for doing it imme|diately: Well, <HI>&s;ays I, Amy,</HI> as &s;oon as you will, but what Cour&s;e mu&s;t we take to do it? we cannot put off Servants and Coach and Hor&s;es, and every Thing, leave off Hou&s;e-keeping, and transform our&s;elves into a new Shape, all in a Moment; Servants mu&s;t have Warn|ing, and the Goods mu&s;t be &s;old off, and a thou&s;and Things, and this began to perplex us, and in particular, took us up two or three Days Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, <HI>Amy,</HI> who was a clever Manager in &s;uch Ca&s;es, came to me with a Scheme, as &s;he call'd it; I have found it out, Madam, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> I have found a Scheme how you &s;hall, if you have a Mind to it, begin and fi|ni&s;h a perfect entire Change of your Figure and Circum|&s;tances, in one Day; and &s;hall be as much unknown, Madam, in twenty four Hours, as you would be in &s;o many Years.</P>
<P>Come, <HI>Amy, &s;ays I,</HI> let us hear it, for you plea&s;e me mightily with the Thoughts of it. Why then, <HI>&s;ays</HI> A|my, let me go into the City this Afternoon, and I'll en|quire out &s;ome hone&s;t, plain, &s;ober Family, where I will take Lodgings for you, as for a Country-Gentle|woman that de&s;ires to be in <HI>London</HI> for about half a Year, and to board your&s;elf and a Kin&s;woman, that is half a Servant, half a Companion, meaning my&s;elf; and &s;o agree with them by the Month.</P>
<P>To this Lodging (if I hit upon one to your Mind) you may go to Morrow Morning in a Hackney-Coach, with no Body but me, and leave &s;uch Cloaths and Lin|nen as you think fit; but to be &s;ure, the plaine&s;t you have, and then you are remov'd at once, you need ne|ver &s;o much as &s;et your Foot in this Hou&s;e again, (mean|ing where we then were) or &s;ee any Body belonging to it; in the mean Time I'll let the Servants know, that
<PB N="220" REF="218">
you are going over to <HI>Holland</HI> upon extraordinary Bu&s;i+ne&s;s, and will leave off your Equipages, and &s;o I'll give them Warning, or, if they will accept of it, give them a Month's Wages; then I will &s;ell off your Furniture as well as I can; as to your Coach, it is but having it new painted, and the Lining chang'd, and getting new Harne&s;s and Hammer-cloths, and you may keep it &s;till, or di&s;po&s;e of it as you think fit; and only take Care to let this Lodging be in &s;ome remote Part of the Town, and you may be as perfectly unknown, as if you had never been in <HI>England</HI> in your Life.</P>
<P>This was <HI>Amy</HI>'s Scheme; and it pleas'd me &s;o well, that I re&s;olved not only to let her go, but was re&s;olved to go with her my&s;elf; but <HI>Amy</HI> put me off of that, be|cau&s;e, <HI>&s;he &s;aid,</HI> &s;he &s;hould have Occa&s;ion to hurry up and down &s;o long, that if I was with her, it would ra|ther hinder than farther her; &s;o I wav'd it.</P>
<P>In a Word, <HI>Amy</HI> went, and was gone five long Hours; but when &s;he came back, I could &s;ee by her Counte|nance, that her Succe&s;s had been &s;uitable to her Pains; for &s;he came laughing and gaping, O Madam! <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> I have plea&s;ed you to the Life; and with that, &s;he tells me how &s;he had fix'd upon a Hou&s;e in a Court in the <HI>Minories;</HI> that &s;he was directed to it meerly by Accident; that it was a Female Family, the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e being gone to <HI>New-England;</HI> and that the Woman had four Children, kept two Maids, and liv'd very hand|&s;omely, but wanted Company to divert her; and that on that very Account, &s;he had agreed to take Boarders.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> agreed for a good hand&s;ome Price, becau&s;e &s;he was re&s;olved I &s;hould be us'd well; &s;o &s;he bargain'd to give her 35 <HI>l.</HI> for the half Year, and 50 <HI>l.</HI> if we took a Maid, leaving that to my Choice; and that we might be &s;atisfy'd we &s;hould meet with nothing very gay, the People were QUAKERS, and I lik'd them the better.</P>
<P>I was &s;o plea&s;ed that I re&s;olved to go with <HI>Amy</HI> the next Day to &s;ee the Lodgings, and to &s;ee the Woman of the Hou&s;e, and &s;ee how I lik'd them; but if I was pleas'd with the General, I was much more pleas'd with the Par|ticulars; for the Gentlewoman, I mu&s;t call her &s;o, tho' &s;he was a QUAKER, was a mo&s;t courteous, obliging,
<PB N="221" REF="219">
mannerly Per&s;on; perfectly well-bred, and perfectly well-humour'd, and in &s;hort, the mo&s;t agreeable Con|ver&s;ation that ever I met with; and which was worth all, &s;o grave, and yet &s;o plea&s;ant and &s;o merry, that 'tis &s;carce po&s;&s;ible for me to expre&s;s how I was plea&s;ed and delighted with her Company; and particularly, I was &s;o plea&s;ed that I would go away no more; &s;o I e'en took up my Lodging there the very fir&s;t Night.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, tho' it took up <HI>Amy</HI> almo&s;t a Month &s;o entirely, to put off all the Appearances of Hou&s;e-keeping, as above, it need take me up no Time to relate it; 'tis enough to &s;ay, that <HI>Amy</HI> quitted all that Part of the World, and came Pack and Package to me, and here we took up our Abode.</P>
<P>I was now in a perfect Retreat indeed; remote from the Eyes of all that ever had &s;een me, and as much out of the Way of being ever &s;een or heard of by any of the Gang that us'd to follow me, as if I had been among the Mountains in <HI>Lanca&s;hire;</HI> for when did a blue Gar|ter, or a Coach-and-&s;ix come into a little narrow Pa&s;&s;age in the <HI>Minories</HI> or <HI>Goodman's-Fields?</HI> And as there was no Fear of them, &s;o really I had no De&s;ire to &s;ee them, or &s;o much as to hear from them any more as long as I lived.</P>
<P>I &s;eem'd in a little Hurry while <HI>Amy</HI> came and went &s;o every Day at fir&s;t; but when that was over I lived here perfectly retired, and with a mo&s;t plea&s;ant and a|greeable Lady; I mu&s;t call her &s;o, for tho' a QUAKER, &s;he had a full Share of good Breeding &s;ufficient to her, if &s;he had been a Dutche&s;s; in a Word, &s;he was the mo&s;t agreeable Creature in her Conver&s;ation, <HI>as I &s;aid before,</HI> that ever I met with.</P>
<P>I pretended, after I had been there &s;ome Time, to be extremely in Love with the Dre&s;s of the QUAKERS, and this plea&s;ed her &s;o much, that &s;he would needs dre&s;s me up one Day in a Suit of her own Cloaths; but my real De&s;ign was, to &s;ee whether it would pa&s;s upon me for a Di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was &s;truck with the Novelty, tho' I had not mentioned my De&s;ign to her, and when the QUAKER was gone out of the Room, <HI>&s;ays</HI> Amy, I gue&s;s your
<PB N="222" REF="220">
Meaning; it is a perfect Di&s;gui&s;e to you; why you look quite another Body, I &s;hould not have known you my|&s;elf; nay, <HI>&s;ays</HI> Amy, more than that, it makes you look ten Years younger than you did.</P>
<P>Nothing could plea&s;e me better than that; and when <HI>Amy</HI> repeated it, I was &s;o fond of it, that I ask'd my QUAKER, (I won't call her Landlady, 'tis indeed too coar&s;e a Word for her, and &s;he de&s;erv'd a much better; I &s;ay, I ask'd her if &s;he would &s;ell it; I told her I was &s;o fond of it, that I would give her enough to bay he$ a better Suit; &s;he declined it at fir&s;t, but I &s;oon perceiv'd that it was chiefly in good Manners, becau&s;e I &s;hould not di&s;honour my&s;elf, as &s;he call'd it, to put on her old Cloaths; but if I pleas'd to accept of them, &s;he would give me them for my Dre&s;&s;ing-cloaths, and go with me, and buy a Suit for me, that might be better worth my wearing.</P>
<P>But as I conver&s;ed in a very frank open Manner with her, I bid her do the like with me; that I made no Scru|ples of &s;uch Things; but that if &s;he would let me have them, I would &s;atisfy her; &s;o &s;he let me know what they co&s;t, and to make her Amends, I gave her three Guineas more than they co&s;t her.</P>
<P>This good (tho' unhappy) QUAKER had the Misfor|tune to have had a bad Husband, and he was gone be|yond Sea; &s;he had a good Hou&s;e and well furni&s;hed, and had &s;ome Jointure of her own E&s;tate, which &s;upported her and her Children, &s;o that &s;he did not want; but &s;he was not at all above &s;uch a Help, as my being there was to her; &s;o &s;he was as glad of me, as I was of her.</P>
<P>However, as I knew there was no Way to fix this new Acquaintance, like making my&s;elf a Friend to her, I began with making her &s;ome hand&s;ome Pre&s;ents, and the like, to her Children. And fir&s;t, opening my Bundies one Day in my Chamber, I heard her in another Room, and call'd her in with a kind of familiar Way; there I &s;hew'd her &s;ome of my fine Cloaths, and having among the re&s;t of my Things a Piece of very fine new Holland, which I had bought a little before, worth about <HI>9s.</HI> an Ell, I pull'd it out, <HI>Here, my Friend,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>I will make you</HI>
<PB N="223" REF="221">
<HI>a Pre&s;ent, if you will accept of it;</HI> and with that I laid the Piece of Holland in her Lap.</P>
<P>I could &s;ee &s;he was &s;urprized, and that &s;he could hard|ly &s;peak; <HI>What do&s;t thou mean?</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>indeed I can|not have the Face to accept &s;o fine a Pre&s;ent as this;</HI> ad|ding, <HI>'Tis fit for thy own U&s;e, but 'tis above my Wear indeed.</HI> I thought &s;he had meant &s;he mu&s;t not wear it &s;o fine, becau&s;e &s;he was a QUAKER; &s;o I return'd, Why, do not you Quakers wear fine Linnen neither? Yes, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> we wear fine Linnen when we can afford it, but this is too good for me. However, I made her take it, and &s;he was very thankful too; but my End was an&s;wered another Way, for by this I engaged her &s;o, that as I found her a Woman of Under&s;tanding, and of Hone&s;ty too, I might, upon any Occa&s;ion, have a Confidence in her, which was indeed, what I very much wanted.</P>
<P>By accu&s;toming my&s;elf to conver&s;e with her, I had not only learn'd to dre&s;s like a QUAKER, but &s;o us'd my&s;elf to THEE and THOU, that I talk'd like a QUAKER too, as ready and naturally as if I had been born among them; and, in a Word, I pa&s;s'd for a QUAKER among all People that did not know me. I went but little abroad, but I had been &s;o us'd to a Coach, that I knew not how well to go without one; be&s;ides, I thought it would be a farther Di&s;gui&s;e to me, &s;o I told my Quaker-Friend one Day, that I thought I lived too clo&s;e, that I wanted A$r; &s;he propos'd taking a Hackney-Coach &s;ometimes, or a Boat; but I told her I had always had a Coach of my own till now, and I could find in my Heart to have one again.</P>
<P>She &s;eem'd to think it &s;trange at fir&s;t, con&s;idering how clo&s;e I liv'd, but had not nothing to &s;ay when &s;he found I did not value the Expence; &s;o in &s;hort, I re&s;olved I would have a Coach. When we came to talk of Equipages, &s;he extoll'd the having all Things plain, I &s;aid &s;o too; &s;o I left it to her Direction, and a Coach Maker was &s;ent for, and he provided me a plain Coach, no gilding or painting, lin'd with a light grey Cloath, and my Coachman had a Coat of the &s;ame, and no Lace on his Hat.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="222">
When all was ready, I dre&s;s'd my&s;elf in the Dre&s;s I bought of her, <HI>and &s;aid,</HI> Come, I'll be a QUAKER to Day, and you and I'll go abroad, which we did; and there was not a QUAKER in the Town that look'd le&s;s like a Counterfeit than I did. But all this was my par|ticular Plot to be the more compleatly concealed, and that I might depend upon being not known, and yet need not be confin'd like a Pri&s;oner, and be always in Fear: &s;o that all the re&s;t was Grimace.</P>
<P>We lived there very ea&s;y and quiet, and yet I cannot &s;ay I was &s;o in my Mind; I was like a Fi&s;h out of Wa|ter; I was as gay, and as young in my Di&s;po&s;ition, as I was at five and twenty; and as I had always been courted, flatter'd, and us'd to love it, &s;o I mi&s;s'd it in my Conver&s;ation; and this put me many Times upon lock|ing back upon Things pa&s;t.</P>
<P>I had very few Moments in my Life, which in their Reflection, afforded me any Thing but Regret; but of all the fooli&s;h Actions I had to look back upon in my Life, none look'd &s;o prepo&s;terous, and &s;o like Di&s;tracti|on, nor left &s;o much Melancholy on my Mind, as my parting with my Friend, the <HI>Merchant of Paris,</HI> and the refu&s;ing him upon &s;uch honourable and ju&s;t Corditi|ons as he had offered; and tho' on his ju&s;t (which I cal|led unkind) rejecting my Invitation to come to him a|gain, I had look'd on him with &s;ome Di&s;gu&s;t, yet now my Mind run upon him continually, and the ridiculous Conduct of my refu&s;ing him, and I could never be &s;atis|fy'd about him; I flatter'd my&s;elf, that if I could &s;ee him, I could yet ma&s;ter him, and that he would pre|&s;ently forget all that had pa&s;s'd, that might be thought unkind; but as there was no Room to imagine any Thing like that to be po&s;&s;ible, I threw tho&s;e Thoughts off again as much as I could.</P>
<P>However, they continually return'd, and I had no Re&s;t Night or Day, for thinking of him, whom I had forgot above eleven Years. I told <HI>Amy</HI> of it, and we talk'd it over &s;ometimes in Bed, almo&s;t whole Nights together. At la&s;t <HI>Amy</HI> &s;tarted a Thing of her own Head, which put it in a Way of Management, tho' a wild one too. <HI>You are &s;o unea&s;y, Madam,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>about</HI>

<P>Not for ten thou&s;and Pounds, &s;aid I; no, nor if you met him in the Street, not to offer to &s;peak to him on my Account: No, &s;ays <HI>Amy,</HI> I wou'd not &s;peak to him at all, or if I did, I warrant you it &s;hall not look to be upon your Account; I'll only enquire after him, and if he is in Being, you &s;hall hear of him, if not, you &s;hall hear of him &s;till, and that may be enough.</P>

<P><HI>Amy</HI> promis'd me all that I de&s;ir'd; and, in a Word, to cut the Story &s;hort, I let her go; but ty'd her up to &s;o many Particulars, that it was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible her going cou'd &s;ignify any Thing; and had &s;he intended to ob&s;erve them, &s;he might as well have &s;taid at home $t have gone; for I charg'd her, if &s;he came to &s;ee him, &s;he &s;hou'd not &s;o much as take Notice that &s;he knew him again; and if he &s;poke to her, &s;he &s;hould tell him, the was come away from me a great many Years ago, and knew nothing what was become of me; that &s;he had been come over to <HI>France</HI> &s;ix Years ago, and was marry'd there, and liv'd at <HI>Calais,</HI> or to that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> promis'd me nothing indeed, for, as &s;he &s;aid, it was impo&s;&s;ible for her to re&s;olve what wou'd be fit to do, or not to do, till &s;he was there upon the Spot, and had found out the Gentleman, or heard of him; but that then, if I wou'd tru&s;t her, as I had always done, &s;he wou'd an&s;wer for it, that &s;he wou'd do nothing but what &s;hou'd be for my Intere&s;t, and what &s;he wou'd hope I &s;hou'd be very well pleas'd with.</P>
<P>With this general Commi&s;&s;ion, <HI>Amy,</HI> notwith&s;tand|ing &s;he had been &s;o frighted at the Sea, ventur'd her $$rea&s;s once more by Water, and away &s;he goes to <HI>France;</HI> &s;he had &s;our Articles of Confidence in Charge to enquire after, for me, and as I found by her, &s;he had one for her&s;elf; I &s;ay, &s;our for me, becau&s;e tho'

<PB N="227" REF="225">
great Enquiry after me; that he (his Gentleman) had made all the Search he had been able, for me; but that he cou'd not hear of me; that he believ'd if his Lord had known I had been in <HI>England,</HI> he wou'd have gone over to me; but that, after long Enquiry, he was oblig'd to give it over; but that he verily be|liev'd, if he cou'd have found me, he wou'd have mar|ried me; and that he was extremely concern'd that he cou'd hear nothing of me.</P>
<P>I was not at all &s;atisfy'd with <HI>Amy</HI>'s Account, but order'd her to go to <HI>Roan</HI> her&s;elf; which &s;he did, and there with much Difficulty, (the Per&s;on &s;he was directed to being dead) I &s;ay, with much Difficulty, &s;he came to be inform'd, that my Merchant had liv'd there two Years, or &s;omething more; but that having met with a very great Misfortune, he had gone back to <HI>Holland,</HI> as the <HI>French</HI> Merchant &s;aid, where he &s;taid two Years; but with this Addition, <HI>viz.</HI> that he came back again to <HI>Roan,</HI> and liv'd in good Reputation there another Year; and afterwards, he was gone to <HI>England;</HI> and that he liv'd in <HI>London:</HI> But <HI>Amy</HI> cou'd by no Means learn how to write to him there, till by great Accident, an old <HI>Dutch</HI> Skipper, who had formerly &s;erv'd him, coming to <HI>Roan, Amy</HI> was told of it; and he told her, that he lodg'd in St. <HI>Laurence Pountn$y's Lane,</HI> in <HI>Lon|don;</HI> but was to be &s;een every Day upon the <HI>Exchange,</HI> in the <HI>French</HI> Walk.</P>
<P>This <HI>Amy</HI> thought it was Time enough to tell me of, when &s;he came over; and be&s;ides &s;he did not find this <HI>Dutch</HI> Skipper, till &s;he had &s;pent four or five Months, and been again at <HI>Paris,</HI> and then come back to <HI>Roan</HI> for farther Information: But in the mean Time &s;he wrote me from <HI>Paris,</HI> that he was not to be found by any Means; that he had been gone from <HI>Pa|ris</HI> &s;even or eight Years; that &s;he was told he had liv'd at <HI>Roan,</HI> and &s;he was a going thither to enquire, but that &s;he had heard afterward, that he was gone al&s;o from thence to <HI>Holland,</HI> &s;o &s;he did not go.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="226">
This, I &s;ay, was <HI>Amy</HI>'s fir&s;t Account; and I not &s;a|tisfy'd with it, had &s;ent her an Order to go to <HI>Roan,</HI> to enquire there al&s;o, as above.</P>
<P>While this was negociating, and I receiv'd the&s;e Ac|counts from <HI>Amy</HI> at &s;everal Times, a &s;trange Adventure happen'd to me, which I mu&s;t mention ju&s;t here; I had been Abroad to take the Air, as u&s;ual, with my QUAK|ER, as far as <HI>Epping Forre&s;t,</HI> and we were driving back towards <HI>London;</HI> when on the Road between <HI>Bow</HI> and <HI>Mile-End,</HI> two Gentlemen on Hor&s;eback came riding by, having overtaken the Coach, and pa&s;s'd it, and went forwards towards <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>They did not ride apace, tho' they pa&s;s'd the Coach, for we went very &s;oftly, nor did they look into the Coach at all, but rode &s;ide by &s;ide, earne&s;tly talking to one another, and inclining their Faces &s;ide-ways a lit|tle towards one another, he that went neare&s;t the Coach, with his Face from it, and he that was farthe&s;t from the Coach, with his Face towards it, and pa&s;&s;ing in the very next Tract to the Coach, I cou'd hear them talk <HI>Dutch</HI> very di&s;tinctly; but it is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the Confu&s;ion I was in, when I plainly &s;aw that the farthe&s;t of the two, him who&s;e Face look'd towards the Coach, was my Friend, the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant of <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>If it had been po&s;&s;ible to conceal my Di&s;order from my Friend, the QUAKER, I would have done it, but I found &s;he was too well acquainted with &s;uch Things, not to take the Hint; do&s;t thou under&s;tand <HI>Dutch? &s;aid &s;he; Why? &s;aid I; Why, &s;ays &s;he,</HI> 'tis ea&s;y to &s;uppo&s;e that thou art a little concern'd at &s;omewhat tho&s;e Men &s;ay; I &s;uppo&s;e they are talking of thee. Indeed my good Friend, &s;aid I, thou art mi&s;taken this Time, for I know very well what they are talking of, but 'ts all about Ships and Trading Affairs: Well, &s;ays &s;he, then one of them is a Man Friend of thine, or &s;ome|what is the Ca&s;e; for tho' thy Tongue will not confe&s;s it, thy Face does.</P>
<P>I was going to have told a bold Lye, and &s;aid, I knew nothing of them, but I found it was impo&s;&s;ible to conceal it, &s;o I &s;aid, indeed, I think I kn$w the
<PB N="229" REF="227">
farthe&s;t of them; but I have neither &s;poken to him, or &s;o much as &s;een him for above 11 Years: Well then, &s;ays &s;he, Thou ha&s;t &s;een him with more than common Eyes, when thou did'&s;t &s;ee him; or el&s;e &s;eeing him now would not be &s;uch a Surprize to thee: Indeed, &s;aid I, 'tis true I am a little &s;urpriz'd at &s;eeing him ju&s;t now, for I thought he had been in quite another Part of the World; and I can a&s;&s;ure you, I never &s;aw him in <HI>England</HI> in my Life: Well then, 'tis the more likely he is come over now on purpo&s;e to &s;eek thee: No, no, &s;aid I, Knight Errantry is over, Women are not &s;o hard to come at, that Men &s;hould not be able to plea&s;e them&s;elves without running from one Kingdom to an|other: Well, well, &s;ays &s;he, I would have him &s;ee thee for all that, as plainly as thou ha&s;t &s;een him; No, but he &s;han't, &s;ays I, for I am &s;ure he don't know me in this Dre&s;s, and I'll take Care he &s;han't &s;ee my Face, if I can help it; &s;o I held up my Fan before my Face, and &s;he &s;aw me re&s;olute in that, &s;o &s;he pre&s;s'd me no farther.</P>
<P>We had &s;everal Di&s;cour&s;es upon the Subject, but &s;till I let her know I was re&s;olv'd he &s;hould not know me; but, at la&s;t, I confe&s;s'd &s;o much, that tho' I would not let him know who I was, or where I liv'd, I did not care if I knew where he liv'd, and how I might enquire about him: She took the Hint imme|diately, and her Servant being behind the Coach, &s;he call'd him to the Coach-&s;ide, and bade him keep his Eye upon that Gentleman, and as &s;oon as the Coach came to the End of <HI>White Chapple,</HI> he &s;hould get down, and follow him clo&s;ely, &s;o as to &s;ee where he put up his Hor&s;e, and then to go into the Inn, and enquire, if he could, who he was, and where he liv'd.</P>
<P>The Fellow follow'd diligently to the Gate of an Inn in <HI>Bi&s;hopgate Street,</HI> and &s;eeing him go in, made no doubt but he had him fa&s;t, but was confounded, when upon Enquiry he found the Inn was a Thorow|fare into another Street, and that the two Gentlemen had only rode thorow the Inn, as the Way to the Street
<PB N="230" REF="228">
where they were going, and &s;o, in &s;hort, came back no wi&s;er than he went.</P>
<P>My kind QUAKER was more vex'd at the Di&s;ap|pointment, at lea&s;t apparently &s;o, than I was; and asking the Fellow, if he was &s;ure he knew the Gen|tleman again if he &s;aw him; the Fellow &s;aid, he had follow'd him &s;o clo&s;e, and took &s;o much Notice of him, in order to do his Errand as it ought to be done, that he was very &s;ure he &s;hould know him again; and that be&s;ides, he was &s;ure he &s;hould know his Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>This Part was, indeed, likely enough; and the kind QUAKER, without telling me any Thing of the Matter, caus'd her Man to place him&s;elf ju&s;t at the Corner of <HI>Whitechapple Church Wall</HI> every <HI>Saturday</HI> in the Afternoon, that being the Day when the Citizens chiefly ride Abroad to take the Air; and there to watch all the Afternoon, and look for him.</P>
<P>It was not till the fifth <HI>Saturday,</HI> that her Man came, with a great deal of Joy, and gave her an Account, that he had found out the Gentleman; that he was a <HI>Dutchman,</HI> but a <HI>French</HI> Merchant; that he came from <HI>Roan,</HI> and his Name was&mdash;, and that he lodg'd at Mr.&mdash;on <HI>Laurence Pountney's Hill:</HI> I was &s;urpriz'd, you may be &s;ure, when &s;he came and told me one Evening, all the Particulars, except that of hav|ing &s;et her Man to watch: I have found out thy <HI>Dutch</HI> Friend, &s;ays &s;he, and can tell THEE how to find him too; I colour'd again as red as Fire: Then THOU ha&s;t dealt with the Evil One, Friend, <HI>&s;aid I very g$avely:</HI> No, no, &s;ays &s;he, I have no Familiar; but I tell thee, I have found him for thee, and his Name is &s;o and &s;o; and he lives as above recited.</P>
<P>I was &s;urpriz'd again at this, not being able to ima|gine how &s;he &s;hou'd come to know all this: However, to put me out of Pain, &s;he told me what &s;he had done; well, &s;aid I, thou art very kind, but this is not worth thy Pains; for I know it, 'tis only to &s;atisfy my Curi|o&s;ity, for I &s;hall not &s;end to him upon any Account: Be that as thou wilt, &s;ays &s;he; be&s;ides, added &s;he, thou art in the right to &s;ay &s;o to me; for why &s;hou'd I be
<PB N="231" REF="229">
tru&s;ted with it? tho' if I were, I a&s;&s;ure thee, I &s;hou'd not betray thee: That is very kind, &s;aid I, and I be|lieve thee; and a&s;&s;ure thy&s;elf, if I do &s;end to him, thou &s;halt know it, and be tru&s;ted with it too</P>
<P>During this Interval of five Weeks, I &s;uffer'd a hun|dred thou&s;and Perplexitie of Mind. I was thorowly convinc'd I was right as to the Per&s;on, that it was the Man; I knew him &s;o well, and &s;aw him &s;o plain, I cou'd not be deceiv'd: I drove out again in the Coach, (on Pretence of Air) almo&s;t every Day, in hopes of &s;ee|ing him gain, but was never &s;o lucky as to &s;ee him; and now I had made the Di&s;covery, I was as far to &s;eek what Mea&s;ures to take, as I was before.</P>
<P>To &s;end to him, or &s;peak to him fir&s;t if I &s;hou'd &s;ee him, &s;o as to be known to him, that I re&s;olv'd not to do, if I dy'd for it; to watch him about hi Lodging, that was as much below my Spirit as the other; &s;o that, in a Word, I was at a perfect Lo&s;s how to act, or what to do.</P>
<P>At length came <HI>Amy</HI>'s Letter, with the la&s;t Account which &s;he had at <HI>Roan,</HI> from the <HI>Dutch</HI> Skipper, which confirming the other, left me out of Doubt that this was my Man; but &s;till, no human Invention cou'd bring me to the Speech of him, in &s;uch a Manner as wou'd &s;uit with my Re&s;olutions; for, after all, how did I know what his Circum&s;tances were? whether marry'd or &s;ingle? and if he had a Wife, I knew he was &s;o hone&s;t a Man, he wou'd not &s;o much as conver&s;e with me, or &s;o much as know me, if he met me in the Street.</P>
<P>In the next Place, as he had entirely neglected me, which, in &s;hort, is the wor&s;t Way of &s;lighting a Wo|man, and had given no An&s;wer to my Letters, I did not know but he might be the &s;ame Man &s;till; &s;o I re|&s;olv'd, that I cou'd do nothing in it, unle&s;s &s;ome fairer Opportunity pre&s;ented, which might make my Way clearer to me; for I was determin'd he &s;hou'd have no Room to put any more Slights upon me</P>
<P>In the&s;e Thoughts I pa&s;s'd away near three Months: till at la&s;t, (being impatient) I re&s;olv'd to &s;end for
<PB N="232" REF="230">
<HI>Amy</HI> to come over, and tell her how Things &s;tood, and that I wou'd do nothing till &s;he came. <HI>Amy</HI> in An&s;wer &s;ent me Word, &s;he wou'd come away with all &s;peed, but begg'd of me, that I wou'd enter into no Engage|ment with him, or any body, till &s;he arriv'd: $ut &s;till keeping me in the dark, as to the Thing it&s;elf, which &s;he had to &s;ay, at which I was heartily vex'd for many Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>But while all the&s;e Things were tran&s;acting, and Letters and An&s;wers pa&s;s'd between <HI>Amy</HI> and I a little &s;lower than u&s;ual, at which I was not &s;o well pleas'd $, I us'd to be with <HI>Amy</HI>'s Di&s;patch; I &s;ay, in this Time the following Scene open'd.</P>
<P>It was one Afternoon, about &s;our a Clock, my Friendly QUAKER and I &s;itting in her Chamber $p Stairs, and very chear&s;ul, chatting together, (for &s;he was the be&s;t Company in the World) when &s;omebody ringing ha&s;tily at the Door, and no Servant ju&s;t then in the Way, &s;he ran down her&s;elf, to the Door: $hen a Gentleman appears with a Footman attending, and ma|king &s;ome Apologies, which &s;he did not thorowly un|der&s;tand, he &s;peaking but broken <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> he ask'd to &s;peak with me, by the very &s;ame Name that I went by in her Hou&s;e; which, by the Way, was not the Name that he had known me by.</P>
<P>She, with very civil Language, in her Way, brought him into a very hand&s;ome Parlour below Stairs, and &s;aid, &s;he wou'd go and &s;ee whether the Per&s;on who lodg'd in her Hou&s;e own'd that Name, and he &s;hou'd hear &s;arther.</P>
<P>I was a little &s;urpriz'd, even before I knew any Thing of who it was, my Mind foreboding the Thing as it happen'd; <HI>(whence that ari&s;es, let the Naturali&s;ts explain to us)</HI> but I was frighted, and ready to die, when my QUAKER came up all gay, and crowing; <HI>There,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>is the</HI> Dutch French <HI>Merchant come to &s;ee thee:</HI> I cou'd not &s;peak one Word to her, nor &s;tir off of my Chair, but &s;at as motionle&s;s as a Statue: She talk'd a thou&s;and plea&s;ant Things to me, but they made no Impre&s;&s;ion on me; at la&s;t &s;he pull'd me, and teiz'd me,
<PB N="233" REF="231">
<HI>Come, come,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>be thy&s;elf, and rouze up,</HI> I mu&s;t go down again to him; what &s;hall I &s;ay to him? &s;ay, &s;aid I, that you have no &s;uch body in the Hou&s;e. That I cannot do, &s;ays &s;he, becau&s;e it is not the Truth; be|&s;ides, I have own'd thou art above; <HI>Come, come, go down with me;</HI> not for a thou&s;and Guineas, &s;aid I; well, &s;ays &s;he, I'll go and tell him thou wilt come quickly; &s;o, without giving me Time to an&s;wer her, away &s;he goes.</P>
<P>A Million of Thoughts circulated in my Head while &s;he was gone, and what to do I cou'd not tell; I &s;aw no Remedy but I mu&s;t &s;peak with him, but wou'd have given 500 <HI>l.</HI> to have &s;hun'd it; yet had I &s;hun'd it, perhaps then I wou'd have given 500 <HI>l.</HI> again, that I had &s;een him; Thus fluctuating and uncon|cluding were my Thoughts; what I &s;o earne&s;tly de|&s;ir'd, I declin'd when it offer'd it&s;elf; and what now I pretended to decline, was nothing but what I had been at the Expence of 40 or 50 <HI>l.</HI> to &s;end <HI>Amy</HI> to <HI>France</HI> for; and even without any View, or indeed, any ra|tional Expectation of bringing it to pa&s;s; and what, for half a Year before, I was &s;o unea&s;y about, that I cou'd not be quiet Night or Day, till <HI>Amy</HI> propos'd to go over to enquire after him: In &s;hort, my Thoughts were all confus'd, and in the utmo&s;t Di&s;order. I had once refus'd and rejected him, and I repented it hearti|ly; then I had taken ill his Silence, and in my Mind rejected him again, but had repented that too. Now I had &s;toop'd &s;o low as to &s;end after him into <HI>France,</HI> which if he had known, perhaps, he had never come after me; and &s;hou'd I reject him a third Time! On the other Hand, he had repented too in his Turn, per|haps, and not knowing how I had acted, either in &s;tooping to &s;end in Search after him, or in the wicked|er Part of my Life, was come over hither to &s;eck me again; and I might take him perhaps, with the &s;ame Advantages as I might have done before, and wou'd I now be backward to &s;ee him! Well, while I was in this Hurry, my Friend the QUAKER, comes up again, and perceiving the Confu&s;ion I was in, &s;he runs to her
<PB N="234" REF="232">
Clo&s;et, and &s;etch'd me a little plea&s;ant Cordial, but I would not ta&s;te it: <HI>O,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>I under&s;tand thee, be not unea&s;y, I'll give thee &s;omething &s;hall take off all the Smell of it; if he ki&s;&s;es thee a thou&s;and Times, he &s;hall be no wi&s;er;</HI> I thought with my&s;elf, Thou art perfectly ac|quainted with Affairs of this Nature, I think you mu&s;t govern me now, &s;o I began to incline to go down with her; upon that, I took the Cordial, and &s;he gave me a kind of &s;picey Pre&s;erve after it, who&s;e Flavour was &s;o &s;trong, and yet &s;o deliciou&s;ly plea&s;ant, that it wou'd cheat the nice&s;t Smelling, and it left not the lea&s;t Taint of the Cordial on the Breath.</P>
<P>Well, after this, (tho' with &s;ome He&s;itation &s;till) I went down a Pair of Back-&s;tairs with her, and into a Dining-room, next to the Parlour in which he was; but there I halted, and de&s;ir'd &s;he wou'd let me con&s;i|der of it a little: Well, do &s;o, &s;ays &s;he, and left me with more Readine&s;s than &s;he did before; <HI>do, con&s;ider and I'll come to thee again.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' I hung back with an Awkardne&s;s that was real|ly unfeign'd, yet when &s;he &s;o readily left me, I thought it was not &s;o kind, and I began to think &s;he &s;hould have pre&s;s'd me &s;till on to it; &s;o fooli&s;hly backward are we to the Thing, which of all the World we mo&s;t de&s;ire; mocking our&s;elves with a feign'd Re$uctance when the Negative &s;hou'd be Death to us; but &s;he was too cunning for me for while I, as it were, blam'd her in my Mind, for not carrying me to him, tho' a$ the &s;ame Time I appear'd backward to &s;ee him; on a &s;udden &s;he unlocks the Folding Doors, which look'd into the next Parlour, and throwing them open, <HI>There</HI> &s;ays &s;he, (u&s;hering him in) <HI>is the &s;ame Per&s;on who, &s;uppo&s;e, thou enquire&s;t for;</HI> and the &s;ame Moment, with a kind of Decency &s;he retir'd, and that &s;o &s;wift, tha$ &s;he wou'd not give us leave hardly to know which Way &s;he went.</P>
<P>I &s;tood up, but was confounded with a &s;udden En+quiry in my Thoughts, how I &s;hou'd receive him and with a Re&s;olution as &s;wift as Lightning, in An+&s;wer to it, &s;aid to my&s;elf, It &s;hall be COLDLY; fo$
<PB N="235" REF="233">
on a &s;udden, I put on an Air of Stiffne&s;s and Ceremony $e$d held it for about two Minutes; but it was with great Difficulty.</P>
<P>He re&s;trained him&s;elf too, on the other Hand, came towards me gravely, and &s;aluted me in Form; but it was, it &s;eems, upon his &s;uppo&s;ing the QUAKER was be|hind him, whereas &s;he, <HI>as I &s;aid,</HI> under&s;tood Things too well, and had retir'd, as if &s;he had vani&s;hed, that he might have full Freedom; for, <HI>as &s;he &s;aid after|wards,</HI> &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed we had &s;een one another before, tho' $t might have been a great a while ago.</P>
<P>Whatever Stiffne&s;s I had put on my Behaviour to him, $$ was &s;urprized in my Mind, and angry at his, and be|gan to wonder what kind of a ceremonious Meeting it $as to be. However, after he perceived the Woman was gone, he made a Kind of a He&s;itation, looking a $ittle round him; <HI>Indeed,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>I thought the Gentle|woman was not withdrawn,</HI> and with that he took me $n his Arms, and ki&s;s'd me three or four Times; but I $hat was prejudic'd to the la&s;t Degree with the Coldne&s;s $f his fir&s;t Salutes, when I did not know the Cau&s;e of $$, could not be thorowly clear'd of the Prejudice, tho' $Word$ did know the Cau&s;e; and thought that even his Return, and taking me in his Arms, did not &s;eem to $ave the &s;ame Ardour with which he us'd to receive me, $nd this made me behave to him awkardly, <HI>and I know $t how,</HI> for a good while; <HI>but this by the Way</HI></P>
<P>He began with a kind of an Exta$y upon the Subject $f his finding me out; how it was po&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould $ave been four Years in <HI>England,</HI> and h$d us'd all the Ways imaginable, and could never &s;o much as have the $a&s;t Intimation of me, or of any one like me; and that was now above two Years that he had de&s;pair'd of it, $$d had given over all Enquiry; and that now he $ould chop upon me, as it were, unlook'd and un&s;ought $r.</P>
<P>I could ea&s;ily have accounted for his not finding me, I had but &s;et down the Detail of my real Retirement; $t I gave it a new, and indeed a truly hypocritical $urn. I told him that any one that knew the Manner Life I led, might account for his not finding me; that
<PB N="236" REF="234">

<P>I could not hear this without being &s;en&s;ibly touched with it; I was a&s;hamed that he &s;hould &s;hew that he had more real Affection for the Child, tho' he had never &s;een it in his Life, than I that bore it; for indeed I did not love the Child, nor love to &s;ee it; and tho' I had pro|vided for it, yet I did it by <HI>Amy</HI>'s Hand, and had not &s;een it above twice in four Years; being privately re|&s;olved that when it grew up, it &s;hould not be able to call me Mother.</P>

<P>He thank'd me for my Kindne&s;s to the Child, with a Tenderne&s;s which &s;hewed the Sincerity of all he had &s;aid before; and which encrea&s;ed the Regret with which, <HI>as I &s;aid,</HI> I look'd back on the little Affection I had &s;hew'd to the poor Child. He told me he did not de&s;ire to take him from me, but &s;o as to introduce him into the World as his own; which he could &s;till do, having liv'd ab&s;ent from his other Children (for he had two Sons and a Daughter which were brought up at <HI>Nimeguen</HI> in <HI>Hol|land,</HI> with a Si&s;ter of his) &s;o long, that he might very well &s;end another Son of ten Years old to be bred up with them; and &s;uppo&s;e his Mother to be dead or alive, as he found Occa&s;ion; and that as I had re&s;olved to do &s;o hand&s;omely for the Child, he would add to it &s;omething con&s;iderable, tho' having had &s;ome great Di&s;appoint|ments, <HI>(repeating the Words)</HI> he could not do for it as he would otherwi&s;e have done.</P>
<P>I then thought my&s;elf obliged to take Notice of his having &s;o often mentioned his having <HI>met with Di&s;ap|pointments;</HI> I told him I was very &s;orry to hear he had met with any Thing afflicting to him in the World; that I would not have any Thing belonging to me add to his Lo&s;s, or weaken him in what he might do for his other Children; and that I would not agree to his having the Child away, <HI>tho' the Propo&s;al was infinitely to the Child's Advantage,</HI> unle&s;s he would promi&s;e me, that the whole Expence &s;hould be mine; and that if he did not think <HI>5000l.</HI> enough for the Child, I would give it more.</P>
<P>We had &s;o much Di&s;cour&s;e upon this, <HI>and the old Af|fairs,</HI> that it took up all our Time at his fir&s;t Vi&s;it; I was a little importunate with him to tell me how he came to find me out, but he put it off for that Time; and only obtaining my Leave to vi&s;it me again, he went away; and indeed my Heart was &s;o full of what he had &s;aid already, that I was glad when he went away; &s;ome|times I was full of Tenderne&s;s and Affection for him,

<P>At other Times I con&s;idered the Wealth I was Mi|&s;tre&s;s of; that I was able to live like a Prince&s;s, tho' not a Prince&s;s; and that my Merchant <HI>(for he had told me all the Affair of his Misfortunes)</HI> was far from being poor, or even mean; that together, we were able to make up an E&s;tate of between three and four thou&s;and Pounds a Year, which was in it&s;elf equal to &s;ome Princes abroad. But tho' this was true, yet the Name of <HI>Prince&s;s,</HI> and the Flutter of it, <HI>in a Word,</HI> the Pride weighed them down; and all the&s;e Arguings generally ended to the Di&s;advantage of my Merchant; &s;o that, <HI>in &s;hort,</HI> I re|&s;olved to drop him, and give him a final An&s;wer at his next coming; <HI>namely,</HI> That &s;omething had happened in my Affairs, which had cau&s;ed me to alter my Mea|&s;ures unexpectedly; and, <HI>in a Word,</HI> to de&s;ire him to trouble him&s;elf no farther.</P>
<P>I think verily this rude Treatment of him, was for &s;ome Time, the Effect of a violent Fermentation in my Blood; for the very Motion which the &s;teddy Contem|plation of my fancy'd Greatne&s;s had put my Spirits into, had thrown me into a kind of Fever, and I &s;carce knew what I did.</P>
<P>I have wondered &s;ince that it did not make me mad; nor do I now think it &s;trange to hear of tho&s;e, who have
<PB N="247" REF="245">
been quite <HI>Lunatic</HI> with their Pride; that fancy'd them|&s;elves Queens and Empre&s;&s;es, and have made their At|tendants &s;erve them upon the Knee, given Vi&s;itors their Hand to ki&s;s, <HI>and the like;</HI> for certainly, if Pride will not turn the Brain, nothing can.</P>
<P>However, the next Time my Gentleman came, I had not Courage enough, <HI>or not Ill-nature enough,</HI> to treat him in the rude Manner I had re&s;olved to do, and it was very well I did not; for &s;oon after I had another Let|ter from <HI>Amy,</HI> in which was the mortifying News, and indeed &s;urprizing to me, that my Prince <HI>(as I with a &s;ecret Plea&s;ure had called him)</HI> was very much hurt by a Brui&s;e he had received in hunting and engaging with a wild Boar; a cruel and de&s;perate Sport, which the Noblemen of <HI>Germany,</HI> it &s;eems, much delight in.</P>
<P>This alarm'd me indeed, and the more, becau&s;e <HI>Amy</HI> wrote me Word, that his Gentleman was gone away expre&s;s to him, not without Apprehen&s;ions, that he &s;hould find his Ma&s;ter was dead, before his coming Home; but that he <HI>[the Gentleman]</HI> had promi&s;ed her, that &s;o &s;oon as he arrived he would &s;end back the &s;ame Courier to her, with an Account of his Ma&s;ter's Health, and of the main Affair; and that he had oblig'd <HI>Amy</HI> to &s;tay at <HI>Paris</HI> fourteen Days for his Return; &s;he having promis'd him before to make it her Bu&s;ine&s;s to go to <HI>England,</HI> and to find me out for his Lord, if he &s;ent her &s;uch Orders; and he was to &s;end her a Bill for fifty Pi|&s;toles for her Journey. So <HI>Amy</HI> told me &s;he waited for the An&s;wer.</P>
<P>This was a Blow to me &s;everal Ways; for <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> I was in a State of Uncertainty as to his Per&s;on, whether he was alive or dead; and I was not unconcerned in that Part, I a&s;&s;ure you; for I had an inexpre&s;&s;ible Affection remaining for his Per&s;on, be&s;ides the Degree to which it was reviv'd by the View of a firmer Intere&s;t in him; <HI>but this was not all,</HI> for in lo&s;ing him I for ever lo&s;t the Pro&s;pect of all the Gaiety and Glory, that had made &s;uch an Impre&s;&s;ion upon my Imagination.</P>
<P>In this State of Uncertainty, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> by <HI>Amy</HI>'s Let|ter, I was like &s;till to remain another Fortnight; and
<PB N="248" REF="246">
had I now continued the Re&s;olution of u&s;ing my Mer|chant in the rude Manner I once intended, I had made perhaps a &s;orry Piece of Work of it indeed, and it was very well my Heart fail'd me, <HI>as it did.</HI></P>
<P>However, I treated him with a great many Shuffles, and feigned Stories to keep him off from any clo&s;er Con|ferences than we had already had, that I might act af|terwards as Occa&s;ion might offer, one Way or other: But that which mortify'd me mo&s;t, was, that <HI>Amy</HI> did not write, tho' the fourteen Days was expired. At la&s;t, to my great Surprize, when I was with the utmo&s;t Im|patience, looking out at the Window, expecting the Po&s;t-man, that u&s;ually brought the Foreign Letters; <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> I was agreeably &s;urprized to &s;ee a Coach come to the Yard-Gate where we lived, and my Woman <HI>Amy</HI> a|light out of it, and come towards the Door, having the Coachman bringing &s;everal Bundles after her.</P>
<P>I flew like Lightning down Stairs to &s;peak to her; but was &s;oon damp'd with her News. Is the Prince a|live or dead, <HI>Amy? &s;ays I:</HI> She &s;poke coldly and &s;light|ly: <HI>He is alive, Madam,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>but it is not much Matter, I had as lieu he had been dead.</HI> So we went up Stairs again to my Chamber, and there we began a &s;e|rious Di&s;cour&s;e of the whole Matter.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>&s;he told me a long Story</HI> of his being hurt by a Wild-boar, and of the Condition he was reduced to, &s;o that every one expected he &s;hould die, the Angui&s;h of the Wound having thrown him into a Fever, with A|bundance of Circum&s;tances too long to relate here, how he recovered of that extreme Danger, but continued ve|ry weak, how the Gentleman had been <HI>Homme de Pa|role,</HI> and had &s;ent back the Courier as punctually as if it had been to the KING, that he had given a long Ac|count of his Lord, and of his Illne&s;s and Recovery; but the Sum of the Matter, <HI>as to me,</HI> was, That as to the Lady, his Lord was turned Penitent, was under &s;ome Vows for his Recovery, and could not think any more on that Affair; and e&s;pecially, the Lady being gone, and that it had not been offer'd to her, &s;o there was no Breach of Honour, but that his Lord was &s;en&s;ible of the good Of|fices
<PB N="249" REF="247">
of Mrs. <HI>Amy,</HI> and had &s;ent her the fifty Pi&s;toles for her Trouble, as if &s;he had really gone the Journey.</P>
<P>I was, I confe&s;s, hardly able to bear the fir&s;t Sur|prize of this Di&s;appointment; <HI>Amy,</HI> &s;aw it, and gapes out, (as was her Way) Law'd Madam! never be con|cern'd at it; you &s;ee he is gotten among the Prie&s;ts; and I &s;uppo&s;e, they have &s;aucily impos'd &s;ome Pennance upon him; and it may be, &s;ent him of an Errand bare|foot to &s;ome <HI>Madonna</HI> or <HI>No&s;terdame</HI> or other; and he is off of his Amours for the pre&s;ent; I'll warrant you, he'll be as wicked again as ever he was, when he is got thorow well, and gets but out of their Hands a|gain, I hate this out-o'-Sea&s;on Repentance; what Oc|ca&s;ion had he, in his Repentance, to be off of taking a good Wife? I &s;hou'd have been glad to &s;ee you have been a Prince&s;s, and all that; but if it can't be, never afflict your&s;elf; you are rich enough to be a Prince&s;s to your&s;elf; you don't want him, that's the be&s;t of it.</P>
<P>Well, I cry'd for all that, and was heartily vex'd, and that a great while; but as <HI>Amy</HI> was always at my Elbow, and always jogging it out of my Head, with her Mirth, and her Wit, it wore off again.</P>
<P>Then I told <HI>Amy</HI> all the Story of my Merchant, and how he had found me out, when I was in &s;uch a Con|cern to find him; how it was true, that he lodg'd in St. <HI>Lawrence Pountney's Lane;</HI> and how I had had all the Story of his Misfortunes, which &s;he had heard of, in which he had lo&s;t above 8000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling; and that he had told me frankly of it, before &s;he had &s;ent me any Account of it, or, at lea&s;t, before I had taken any No|tice that I had heard of it.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was very joyful at that Part. Well, Madam then, &s;ays <HI>Amy,</HI> what need you value the Story of the Prince? and going I know not whither into <HI>Germany,</HI> to lay your Bones in another World, and learn the De|vil's Language, call'd HIGH-DUTCH? You are better here by half, &s;ays <HI>Amy:</HI> Law'd Madam, &s;ays &s;he, why are you not as rich as <HI>Cra&s;&s;us?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="248">
Well, it was a great while &s;till, before I cou'd bring my&s;elf off of this fancy'd Sovereignty; and I that was &s;o willing once to be Mi&s;tre&s;s to a KING, was now ten thou&s;and Times more fond of being Wife to a Prince.</P>
<P>So fa&s;t a Hold has Pride and Ambition upon our Minds, that when once it gets Admi&s;&s;ion, nothing is &s;o chimerical, but under this Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion we can form <HI>Ideas</HI> of in our Fancy, and reallize to our Imagination: Nothing can be &s;o ridiculous as the &s;imple Steps we take in &s;uch Ca&s;es; a Man or a Woman becomes a meer <HI>Malade Imaginaire,</HI> and I believe, may as ea&s;ily die with Grief, or run mad with Joy, (as the Affair in his Fancy appears right or wrong) as if all was real, and actually under the Management of the Per&s;on.</P>
<P>I had indeed, two A&s;&s;i&s;tants to deliver me from this Snare, and the&s;e were, <HI>fir&s;t, Amy,</HI> who knew my Di&s;|ea&s;e, but was able to do nothing as to the Remedy; the <HI>&s;econd,</HI> the Merchant, who really brought the Remedy, but knew nothing of the Di&s;temper.</P>
<P>I remember, when all the&s;e Di&s;orders were upon my Thoughts, in one of the Vi&s;its my Friend the Merchant made me, he took Notice, that he perceiv'd I was un|der &s;ome unu&s;ual Di&s;order; he believ'd, he &s;aid, that my Di&s;temper, whatever it was, lay much in my Head, and it being Summer Weather, and very hot, propos'd to me to go a little Way into the Air.</P>
<P>I &s;tarted at his Expre&s;&s;ion; what &s;ays I, do you think then, that I am craz'd? you &s;hou'd then propo&s;e a Mad-Hou&s;e for my Cure: No, no, &s;ays he, I do not mean any Thing like that, I hope the Head may be di&s;tem|per'd, and not the Brain: Well, I was too &s;en&s;ible that he was right, for I knew I had acted a &s;trange wild kind of Part with him; but he in&s;i&s;ted upon it, and pre$$d me to go into the Country: I took him &s;hort again, What need you, &s;ays I, &s;end me out of your Way? It is in your Power to be le&s;s troubled with me, and with le&s;s Inconvenience to us both.</P>
<P>He took that ill, and told me I us'd to have a better Opinion of his Sincerity; and de&s;ir'd to know what he
<PB N="251" REF="249">
had done to forfeit my Charity: I mention this, only to let you &s;ee how far I had gone in my Mea&s;ures of quitting him, that is to &s;ay, how near I was of &s;hew|ing him how ba&s;e, ungrateful, and how vilely I cou'd act: But I found I had carried the Je&s;t far enough, and that a little Matter might have made him &s;ick of me again, as he was before; &s;o I began, by little and little, to change my Way of talking to him, and to come to Di&s;cour&s;e to the Purpo&s;e again, as we had done before.</P>
<P>A while after this, when we were very merry, and talking familiarly together, he call'd me with an Air of particular Satisfaction, <HI>his Prince&s;s.</HI> I colour'd at the Word, <HI>for it indeed touch'd me to the quick;</HI> but he knew nothing of the Rea&s;on of my being touch'd with it: What d'ye mean by that, &s;aid I? Nay, &s;ays he, I mean nothing, but that you are a Prince&s;s to me: Well, &s;ays I, as to that, I am content; and yet I cou'd tell you, I might have been a Prince&s;s if I wou'd have quitted you, and believe I cou'd be &s;o &s;till: It is not in my Power to make you a Prince&s;s, &s;ays he, but I can ea&s;ily make you a Lady, here in <HI>England,</HI> and a Counte&s;s too, if you will go out of it.</P>
<P>I heard both with a great deal of Satisfaction, for my Pride remain'd, tho' it had been baulk'd, and I thought with my&s;elf, that this Propo&s;al wou'd make &s;ome Amends for the Lo&s;s of the Title that had &s;o tickl'd my Imagination another Way; and I was impatient to un|der&s;tand what he meant; but I wou'd not ask him by any Means; &s;o it pa&s;s'd off for that Time.</P>
<P>When he was gone, I told <HI>Amy</HI> what he had &s;aid, and <HI>Amy</HI> was as impatient to know the Manner how it cou'd be, as I was; but the next Time, (perfectly unexpected to me) he told me, that he had accidental|ly mention'd a Thing to me, la&s;t Time he was with me, having not the lea&s;t Thought of the Thing it&s;elf; but not knowing but &s;uch a Thing might be of &s;ome Weight to me, and that it might bring me Re&s;pect among People where I might appear, he had thought &s;ince of it, and was re&s;olv'd to ask me about it.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="250">
I made light of it, and told him, that as he knew I had cho&s;en a retir'd Life, it was of no Value to me to be call'd LADY, or COUNTESS either; but that if he intended to drag me, as I might call it, into the World again, perhaps it might be agreeable to him; but, be&s;ides that, I cou'd not judge of the Thing, be|cau&s;e I did not under&s;tand how either of them was to be done.</P>
<P>He told me, that Money purchas'd Titles of Honour in almo&s;t all Parts of the World; tho' Money cou'd not give Principles of Honour, they mu&s;t come by Birth and Blood; that however, Titles &s;ometimes a&s;&s;i&s;t to elevate the Soul, and to infu&s;e generous Principles into the Mind, and e&s;pecially, where there was a good Foundation laid in the Per&s;ons; that he hop'd, we &s;hou'd neither of us misbehave, if we came to it; and that as we knew how to wear a Title without undue Elevations, &s;o it might &s;it as well upon us, as on ano|ther; that as to <HI>England,</HI> he had nothing to do, but to get an Act of Naturalization in his Favour, and he knew where to purcha&s;e a Patent for BARONET, that is to &s;ay, to have the Honour and Title transferr'd to him; but if I intended to go Abroad with him, he had a Nephew, the Son of his Elder Brother, who had the Title of COUNT; with the E&s;tate annex'd, which was but &s;mall; and that he had frequently offer'd to make it over to him for a thou&s;and Pi&s;toles, which was not a great deal of Money; and con&s;idering it was in the Fa|mily already, he wou'd, upon my being willing, pur|cha&s;e it immediately.</P>
<P>I told him, I lik'd the la&s;t be&s;t; but then, I wou'd not let him buy it, unle&s;s he wou'd let me pay the thou&s;and Pi&s;toles: No, no, &s;ays he, I refus'd a thou&s;and Pi&s;toles that I had more Right to have accepted than that, and you &s;hall not be at &s;o much Expence now: Yes, &s;ays I, you did refu&s;e it, and perhaps, repented it afterwards: I never complain'd, &s;ays he; but I did, &s;ays I, and often repented it for you: I do not under|&s;tand you, &s;ays he: Why, &s;ays I, I repented that I
<PB N="253" REF="251">
&s;uffer'd you to refu&s;e it: Well, well, &s;aid he, we may talk of that hereafter, when you &s;hall re&s;olve which Part of the World you will make your &s;ettled Re&s;idence in: Here he talk'd very hand&s;omely to me, and for a good while together; how it had been his Lot to live all his Days out of his Native Country, and to be often &s;hifting and changing the Situation of his Affairs; and that I my&s;elf had not always had a fix'd Abode, but that now, as neither of us was very young, he fancy'd I wou'd be for taking up our Abode, where, if po&s;&s;ible, we might remove no more; that as to his Part, he was of that Opinion entirely, only with this Exception, that the Choice of the Place &s;hould be mine; for, that all Places in the World were alike to him, only with this &s;ingle Addition, namely, that I was with him.</P>
<P>I heard him with a great deal of Plea&s;ure, as well for his being willing to give me the Choice, as for that I re&s;olv'd to live Abroad, for the Rea&s;on I have men|tion'd already, <HI>namely,</HI> le&s;t I &s;hould at any Time be known in <HI>England,</HI> and all that Story of <HI>Roxana,</HI> and the Balls, &s;hou'd come out; as al&s;o I was not a little tickl'd with the Satisfaction of being &s;till a <HI>Counte&s;s,</HI> tho' I cou'd not be a <HI>Prince&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>I told <HI>A$y</HI> all this Story, for &s;he was &s;till my Privy-Coun&s;ellor; but when I ask'd her Opinion, &s;he made me laugh heartily: <HI>Now, which of the two &s;hall I take,</HI> Amy? <HI>&s;aid I;</HI> &s;hall I be a Lady, <HI>that is,</HI> a Baronet's Lady in <HI>England,</HI> or a Counte&s;s in <HI>Holland?</HI> the ready witted Jade, that knew the Pride of my Temper too, almo&s;t as well as I did my&s;elf, an&s;wer'd, (without He|&s;itation) <HI>Both, Madam;</HI> which of them! &s;ays &s;he, (re|peating the Words) why not both of them? and then you will be really a <HI>Prince&s;s;</HI> for &s;ure, to be a Lady in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and a Counte&s;s in <HI>Dutch,</HI> may make a Prince&s;s in <HI>High Dutch:</HI> Upon the whole, tho' <HI>Amy</HI> was in je&s;t, &s;he put the Thought into my Head, and I re&s;olv'd, that, in &s;hort, I wou'd be both of them; which I ma|nag'd as you &s;hall hear.</P>

<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I &s;eem'd to re&s;olve that I wou'd live and &s;ettle in <HI>England,</HI> only with this Condition, <HI>namely,</HI> that I wou'd not live in <HI>London.</HI> I pretended that it wou'd choak me up; that I wanted Breath when I was in <HI>London;</HI> but that any where el&s;e I wou'd be &s;atisfied; and then I ask'd him, whether any Sea-Port Town in <HI>England</HI> wou'd not &s;uit him? becau&s;e I knew, tho' he &s;eem'd to leave off, he wou'd always love to be among Bu&s;ine&s;s, and conver&s;ing with Men of Bu&s;ine&s;s; and I nam'd &s;everal Places, either neare&s;t for Bu&s;ine&s;s with <HI>France,</HI> or with <HI>Holland;</HI> as <HI>Dover,</HI> or <HI>Southampton</HI> for the <HI>fir&s;t;</HI> and <HI>Ip&s;wich,</HI> or <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> or <HI>Hull</HI> for the <HI>la&s;t;</HI> but I took Care that we wou'd re&s;olve upon no|thing; only by this it &s;eem'd to be certain, that we &s;hou'd live in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>It was Time now, to bring Things to a Conclu&s;ion, and &s;o in about &s;ix Weeks Time more, we &s;ettled all our Preliminaries; and among the re&s;t, he let me know, that he &s;hould have the Bill for his <HI>Naturalization</HI> pa&s;s'd Time enough; &s;o that he wou'd be, (as he call'd it) an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> before we marry'd: That was &s;oon per|fected, the Parliament being then &s;itting, and &s;everal other Foreigners joining in the &s;aid Bill, to &s;ave the Expence.</P>
<P>It was not above three or four Days after, but that, without giving me the lea&s;t Notice that he had &s;o much as been about the Patent for <HI>Baronet,</HI> he brought it me in a fine embroider'd bag; and &s;aluting me by the Name of my Lady&mdash;(joining his own Sirname to it) pre&s;ented it to me, with his Picture &s;et with Diamonds; and at the &s;ame Time, gave me a Brea&s;t Jewel worth a thou&s;and Pi&s;toles, and the next Morning we were mar|ry'd: Thus I put an End to all the intriguing Part of my Life; a Life full of pro&s;perous Wickedne&s;s; the Reflections upon which, were &s;o much the more afflic|ting, as the Time had been &s;pent in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Crimes, which the more I look'd back upon, the more black and horrid they appear'd, effectually drinking up all the Comfort and Satisfaction which I might otherwi&s;e

<P>The fir&s;t Satisfaction, however, that I took in the new Condition I was in, was in reflecting, that at length the Life of Crime was over; and that I was like a Pa&s;&s;enger coming back from the <HI>Indies,</HI> who having, after may Years Fatigue and Hurry in Bu&s;ine&s;s, got|ten a good E&s;tate, with innumerable Difficulties and Hazards, is arriv'd &s;afe at <HI>London</HI> with all his Effects, and has the Plea&s;ure of &s;aying, he &s;hall never venture upon the Seas any more.</P>

<P>This was all Je&s;t and Allegory; but it was all true, in the Moral of the Fable, as you &s;hall hear in its Place: We were very merry the re&s;t of the Day, but without any Noi&s;e, or Clutter; for he brought not one of his Acquaintance, or Friends, either <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> or Foreign|er: The hone&s;t QUAKER provided us a very noble Dinner indeed, con&s;idering how few we were to eat it; and every Day that Week &s;he did the like, and wou'd, at la&s;t, have it be all at her own Charge, which I was utterly aver&s;e to; <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> becau&s;e I knew her Circum|&s;tances not to be very great, tho' not very low; <HI>and next,</HI> becau&s;e &s;he had been &s;o true a Friend, and &s;o chearful a Comforter to me, ay, and Coun&s;ellor too, in all this Affair, that I had re&s;olv'd to make her a Pre&s;ent, that &s;hou'd be &s;ome Help to her when all was over.</P>
<P>But to return to the Circum&s;tances of our Wedding; after being very merry, as I have told you, <HI>Amy</HI> and the QUAKER, put us to Bed, and the hone&s;t QUAKER little thinking we had been a Bed together eleven Years be|fore; nay, that was a Secret which, as it happen'd, <HI>Amy</HI> her&s;elf did not know: <HI>Amy</HI> grinn'd, and made Faces, as if &s;he had been pleas'd; but it came out in &s;o many Words, when he was not by; the Sum of her mumbling and muttering was, that this &s;hou'd have been done ten or a dozen Years before; that it wou'd fignify little now; that was to &s;ay, in &s;hort, that her Mi&s;tre&s;s was pretty near Fifty, and too old to have

any Children. I chid her, the QUAKER laugh'd, com|plimented me upon my not being &s;o old as <HI>Amy</HI> pre|tended, that I cou'd not be above Forty, and might have a Hou&s;e full of Children yet; but <HI>Amy</HI> and I too, knew better than &s;he, how it was, for, in &s;hort, I was old enough to have done breeding, however I look'd; but I made her hold her Tongue.</P>
<P>In the Morning my QUAKER Landlady came and vi|&s;ited us, before we were up, and made us eat Cakes, and drink Chocolate in Bed; and then left us again, and bid us take a Nap upon it, which I believe we did; in &s;hort, &s;he treated us &s;o hand&s;omly, and with &s;uch an agreeable Chearfulne&s;s, as well as Plenty, as made it appear to me, that QUAKERS may, and that this QUAKER did, under&s;tand good Manners, as well as any other People.</P>
<P>I re&s;i&s;ted her Offer, <HI>however,</HI> of treating us for the the whole Week; and I oppos'd it &s;o long, that I &s;aw evidently that &s;he took it ill, and wou'd have thought her&s;elf &s;lighted, if we had not accepted it; &s;o I &s;aid no more, but let her go on, only told her, I wou'd be even with her, and &s;o I was: However, for that Week &s;he treated us, as &s;he &s;aid &s;he wou'd, and did it &s;o very fine, and with &s;uch a Profu&s;ion of all Sorts of good Things, that the greate&s;t Burthen to her was, how to di&s;po&s;e of Things that were left; for &s;he never let any Thing, how dainty, or however large, be &s;o much as &s;een twice among us.</P>
<P>I had &s;ome Servants indeed, which help'd her off a little; that is to &s;ay, two Maids, for <HI>Amy</HI> was now a Woman of Bu&s;ine&s;s, not a Servant, and eat always with us; I had al&s;o a Coachman, and a Boy; my QUAKER had a Man Servant too, but had but one Maid; but &s;he borrow'd two more of &s;ome of her Friends, for the Occa&s;ion, and had a Man Cook for dre&s;&s;ing the Vic|tuals.</P>
<P>She was only at a Lo&s;s for Plate, which &s;he gave me a Whi&s;per of; and I made <HI>Amy</HI> fetch a large &s;trong Box, which I had lodg'd in a &s;afe Hand, in which was
<PB N="258" REF="256">
all the fine Plate, which I had provided on a wor&s;e Oc|ca&s;ion, as is mention'd before, and I put it into the QUAKER's Hand, obliging her not to u&s;e it as mine, but as her own, for a Rea&s;on I &s;hall mention pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>I was now my Lady&mdash;, and I mu&s;t own, I was exceedingly pleas'd with it, 'twas &s;o Big, and &s;o Great to hear my&s;elf call'd <HI>Her Lady&s;hip,</HI> and <HI>Your Lady&s;hip,</HI> and the like, that I was like the <HI>Indian</HI> King at <HI>Vir|ginia,</HI> who having a Hou&s;e built for him by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and a Lock put upon the Door, wou'd &s;it whole Days together, with the Key in his Hand, locking and un|locking, and double locking the Door, with an unac|countable Plea&s;ure at the Novelty; &s;o I cou'd have &s;at a whole Day together, to hear <HI>Amy</HI> talk to me, and call me <HI>Your Lady&s;hip</HI> at every Word; but after a while the Novelty wore off, and the Pride of it abated, till at la&s;t, truly, I wanted the other Title as much as I did that of <HI>Lady&s;hip</HI> before.</P>
<P>We liv'd this Week in all the innocent Mirth imagi|nable, and our good humour'd QUAKER was &s;o plea|&s;ant in her Way, that it was particularly entertaining to us. We had no Mu&s;ick at all, or Dancing; only I now and then &s;ung a <HI>French</HI> Song to divert my Spou&s;e, who de&s;ir'd it, and the Privacy of our Mirth greatly added to the Plea&s;ure of it. I did not make many Cloaths for my Wedding, having always a great many rich Cloaths by me, which with a little altering for the Fa&s;hion, were perfectly new: The next Day he pre&s;s'd me to dre&s;s, tho' we had no Company; at la&s;t, je&s;ting with him, I told him, I believ'd I was able to dre&s;s me &s;o, in one kind of Dre&s;s that I had by me, that he wou'd not know his Wife when he &s;aw her, e&s;pecially if any Body el&s;e was by: <HI>No!</HI> he &s;aid, <HI>that was impe&s;|&s;ible;</HI> and he long'd to &s;ee that Dre&s;s. I told him, I wou'd dre&s;s me in it, if he wou'd promi&s;e me never to de&s;ire me to appear in it before Company; he pro|mis'd he wou'd not, but wanted to know why too; as Husbands, you know, are inqui&s;itive Creatures, and love to enquire after any Thing they think is kept from
<PB N="259" REF="257">
them; but I had an An&s;wer ready for him; becau&s;e, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> it is not a decent Dre&s;s in this Country, and would not look mode&s;t; neither, indeed, would it, for it was but one Degree off from appearing in one's Shift; but was the u&s;ual Wear in the Country where they were u&s;ed. He was &s;atisfy'd with my An&s;wer, and gave me his Promi&s;e never to ask me to be &s;een in it before Com|pany. I then withdrew, taking only <HI>Amy</HI> and the QUAKER with me; and <HI>Amy</HI> dre&s;s'd me in my old <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Habit which I danc'd in formerly, <HI>&amp;c. as be|fore.</HI> The QUAKER was charmed with the Dre&s;s, <HI>and merrily &s;aid.</HI> That if &s;uch a Dre&s;s &s;hould come to be worn here, &s;he &s;hould not know what to do, &s;he &s;hould be tempted not to dre&s;s in the QUAKERS Way any more.</P>
<P>When all the Dre&s;s was put on, I loaded it with Jew|els, and in particular, I plac'd the large Brea&s;t-Jewel which he had given me of a thou&s;and Pi&s;toles, upon the Front of the <HI>Tyhaia,</HI> or Head-dre&s;s, where it made a mo&s;t glorious Shew indeed. I had my own Diamond-Necklace on, and my Hair was <HI>Tout Brilliant,</HI> all glit|tering with Jewels.</P>
<P>His Picture &s;et with Diamonds, I had plac'd &s;titch'd to my Ve&s;t, ju&s;t, <HI>as might be &s;uppo&s;ed,</HI> upon my Heart, (which is the Compliment in &s;uch Ca&s;es among the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> People) and all being open at the Brea&s;t, there was no Room for any Thing of a Jewel there. In this Figure, <HI>Amy</HI> holding the Train of my Robe, I came down to him. He was &s;urprized, and perfectly a&s;to|ni&s;hed. He knew me, <HI>to be &s;ure,</HI> becau&s;e I had pre|pared, and becau&s;e I had prepared him, and becau&s;e there was no Body el&s;e there, but the QUAKER and <HI>Amy,</HI> but he by no Means knew <HI>Amy,</HI> for &s;he had dre&s;s'd her&s;elf in the Habit of a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Slave, being the Garb of my little <HI>Turk,</HI> which I had at <HI>Naples, as I have &s;aid;</HI> &s;he had her Neck and Arms bare, was bare-headed, and her Hair breeded in a long To&s;&s;el hanging down her Back; but the Jade could neither hold her Countenance, or her chattering Tongue, &s;o as to be concealed long.</P>

Well, he was &s;o charm'd with this Dre&s;s that he would have me &s;it and dine in it; but it was &s;o thin, and &s;o open before, and the Weather being al&s;o &s;harp, that I was afraid of taking Cold; however the Fire be|ing enlarged, and the Doors kept &s;hut, I &s;at to oblige him; and he profe&s;s'd he never &s;aw &s;o fine a Dre&s;s in his Life. I afterwards told him that my Husband <HI>(&s;o he called the Jeweller that was killed)</HI> bought it for me at <HI>Leghorn,</HI> with a young <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Slave which I parted with at <HI>Paris;</HI> and that it was by the Help of that Slave that I learned how to dre&s;s in it, and how every Thing was to be worn, and many of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Cu&s;toms al&s;o, with &s;ome of their Language. This Story agreeing with the Fact, only changing the Per&s;on, was very natural, and &s;o it went off with him; but there was good Rea&s;on why I &s;hould not receive any Company in this Dre&s;s, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> not in <HI>England; I need not repeat it, you will hear more of it.</HI></P>
<P>But when I came abroad I frequently put it on, and upon two or three Occa&s;ions danc'd in it, but always at his Reque&s;t.</P>
<P>We continued at the QUAKER'S Lodgings for above a Year; for now making as tho' it was difficult to deter|mine where to &s;ettle in <HI>England</HI> to his Satisfaction, un|le&s;s in <HI>London,</HI> which was not to mine, I pretended to make him an Offer, that to oblige him, I began to in|cline to go and live abroad with him; that I knew no|thing could be more agreeable to him, and that as to me, every Place was alike; that as I had lived abroad without a Husband &s;o many Years, it could be no Bur|then to me to live abroad again, <HI>e&s;pecially with him.</HI> Then we fell to &s;training our Courte&s;ies upon one another; he told me he was perfectly ea&s;y at living in <HI>England,</HI> and had &s;quar'd all his Affairs accordingly; for that, as he had told me he intended to give over all Bu&s;ine&s;s in the World, as well the Care of managing it, as the Concern about it, &s;eeing we were both in Condition, neither to want it, or to have it be worth our while; &s;o I might &s;ee it was his Intention, by his getting him&s;elf naturaliz'd, and getting the Patent of Baronet, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
<PB N="261" REF="259">
Well, for all that, I told him I accepted his Compli|ment, but I could not but know that his native Country, where his Children were breeding up, mu&s;t be mo&s;t a|greeable to him, and that if I was of &s;uch Value to him, I would be there then to enhan&s;e the Rate of his Satis|faction; that wherever he was would be a Home to me, and any Place in the World would be <HI>England</HI> to me, if he was with me; and thus, <HI>in &s;hort,</HI> I brought him to give me leave to oblige him with going to live abroad; when in Truth, I could not have been perfectly ea&s;y at living in <HI>England,</HI> unle&s;s I had kept con&s;tantly within Doors; le&s;t &s;ome Time or other the di&s;&s;olute Life I had lived here &s;hould have come to be known, and all tho&s;e wicked Things have been known too, which I now be|gan to be very much a&s;ham'd of.</P>
<P>When we clo&s;ed up our Wedding-week, in which our QUAKER had been &s;o very hand&s;ome to us, I told him how much I thought we were obliged to her for her ge|nerous Carriage to us, how &s;he had acted the kinde&s;t Part thro' the whole, and how faithful a Friend &s;he had been to me upon all Occa&s;ions; and then letting him know a little of her Family Unhappine&s;&s;es, I propo&s;ed, that I thought I not only ought to be grateful to her, but really to do &s;omething extraordinary for her, to|wards making her ea&s;y in her Affairs. <HI>And I added,</HI> that I had no Hangers-on that &s;hould trouble him, that there was no Body belong'd to me but what was thorow|ly provided for; and that if I did &s;omething for this ho|ne&s;t Woman, that was con&s;iderable, it &s;hould be the la&s;t Gift I would give to any Body in the World, but <HI>Amy;</HI> and as for her, we were not a going to turn her a|drift, but whenever any Thing offered for her, we would do as we &s;aw Cau&s;e; that, <HI>in the mean Time, Amy</HI> was not poor, that &s;he had &s;aved together between &s;even and eight hundred Pounds; <HI>by the Way, I did not tell him how, and by what wicked Ways &s;he had got it;</HI> but <HI>that &s;he had it;</HI> and that was enough to let him know &s;he would never be in Want of us.</P>
<P>My Spou&s;e was exceedingly plea&s;ed with my Di&s;|cour&s;e about the QUAKER, made a kind of a Speech to
<PB N="262" REF="260">
me upon the Subject of Gratitude, <HI>told me,</HI> it was one of the brighte&s;t Parts of a Gentlewoman, that it was &s;o twi&s;ted with Hone&s;ty, <HI>nay,</HI> and even with Religion too, that he que&s;tioned whether either of them could be found, where Gratitude was not to be found; that in this Act there was not only Gratitude but Charity; and that to make the Charity &s;till more Chri&s;tian-like, the Object too had real Merit to attract it; he therefore agreed to the Thing with all his Heart, only would have had me let him pay it out of his Effects.</P>
<P>I told him, <HI>as for that,</HI> I did not de&s;ign, <HI>whatever I had &s;aid formerly,</HI> that we &s;hould have <HI>two Pockets;</HI> and that tho' I had talked to him of being a free Wo|man, and an Independant, <HI>and the like,</HI> and he had of|fered and promi&s;ed that I &s;hould keep all my own E&s;|tate in my own Hands; yet, that &s;ince I had taken him, I would even do as other <HI>hone&s;t Wives</HI> did, where I thought fit to give my&s;elf, I &s;hould give what I had too; that if I re&s;erved any Thing it &s;hould be only in Ca&s;e of Mortality, and that I might give it to his Children af|terwards, <HI>as my own Gift;</HI> and that, <HI>in &s;hort,</HI> if he thought fit to join Stocks, we &s;hould &s;ee to morrow Morn|ing, what Strength we could both make up in the World, and bringing it all together, con&s;ider before we re&s;olved upon the Place of removing, how we &s;hould di&s;|po&s;e of what we had, as well as of our&s;elves. This Di&s;cour&s;e was too obliging, and he too much a Man of Sen&s;e not to receive it, as it was meant; <HI>he only an&s;wer|ed,</HI> We would do in that, as we &s;hould both agree; but the Thing under our pre&s;ent Care, was to &s;hew not Gra|titude only, but Charity and Affection too, to our kind Friend the QUAKER; and the fir&s;t Word he &s;poke of, was to &s;ettle a thou&s;and Pounds upon her, <HI>for her Life, that is to &s;ay,</HI> &s;ixty Pounds a Year; but in &s;uch a Manner as not to be in the Power of any Per&s;on to reach, but her&s;elf. This was a great Thing, and indeed &s;hewed the generous Principles of my Husband, and for that Rea&s;on I men|tion it; but I thought that a little too much too, and particularly, becau&s;e I had another Thing in View for her, about the Plate; &s;o I told him I thought if he gave

her a Pur&s;e with a hundred Guineas as a Pre&s;ent <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> and then made her a Compliment of 40 <HI>l. per Annum</HI> for her Life, &s;ecured any &s;uch Way as &s;he &s;hould de&s;ire, it would be very hand&s;ome.</P>
<P>He agreed to that; and the &s;ame Day in the Even|ing, when we were ju&s;t going to Bed, he took my QUAKER by the Hand, and with a Ki&s;s, told her, that we had been very kindly treated by her from the Be|ginning of this Affair, and his Wife before, as &s;he <HI>(mean|ing me)</HI> had informed him; and that he thought him|&s;elf bound to let her &s;ee that &s;he had obliged Friends who knew how to be grateful; that for his Part of the Ob|ligation, he de&s;ired &s;he would accept of <HI>that,</HI> for an Acknowledgement in Part only, <HI>(putting the Gold into her Hand)</HI> and that his Wife would talk with her about what farther he had to &s;ay to her; and upon that, not giving her Time hardly to &s;ay <HI>thank ye,</HI> away he went up Stairs into our Bed-chamber, leaving her confu&s;ed, and not knowing what to &s;ay.</P>
<P>When he was gone, &s;he began to make very hand|&s;ome and obliging Repre&s;entations of her good Will to us both, but that it was without Expectation of Reward; that I had given her &s;everal valuable Pre&s;ents before, <HI>and &s;o indeed I had;</HI> for, be&s;ides the Piece of Linnen which I given her <HI>at fir&s;t,</HI> I had given her a Suit of Damask <HI>Table-linnen,</HI> of the Linnen I bought for my Balls, <HI>viz.</HI> Three Table-cloths, and three dozen of Napkins; and at another Time I gave her a little Necklace of Gold-Beads, <HI>and the like;</HI> but this is <HI>by the Way;</HI> but &s;he mentioned them, <HI>I &s;ay;</HI> and how &s;he was obliged by me on many other Occa&s;ions; that &s;he was not in Con|dition to &s;hew her Gratitude any other Way, not being able to make a &s;uitable Return; and that now we took from her all Opportunity to ballance my former Friend|&s;hip, and left her more in Debt than &s;he was before: She &s;poke this in a very good kind of a Manner, <HI>in her own Way,</HI> but which was very agreeable indeed, and had as much apparent Sincerity, and I verily believe as real as was po&s;&s;ible to be expre&s;s'd; but I put a Stop to it, and bid her &s;ay no more, but accept of what my

Spou&s;e had given her, which was but in Part, as &s;he had heard him &s;ay; <HI>and put it up,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>and come and &s;it down here, and give me Leave to &s;ay &s;omething el&s;e to you on the &s;ame Head, which my Spou&s;e and I have &s;ettled between our&s;elves in your Behalf.</HI> What do&s;t Thee mean, <HI>&s;ays &s;he?</HI> and blu&s;h'd, and look'd &s;urprized, but did not &s;tir.

<P>Let no Reader wonder at my extraordinary Concern for this poor Woman; or at my giving my Bounty to her a Place in this Account.

<P>But &s;he came to her&s;elf at la&s;t, and began to &s;ay &s;ome very good Things in Return for my Kindne&s;s; I would not let her go on, but <HI>told her</HI> I had more to &s;ay to her &s;till than all this, but that I would let it alone till an|other Time; my Meaning was about the Box of Plate, good Part of which I gave her, and &s;ome I gave to <HI>A|my,</HI> for I had &s;o much Plate, and &s;ome &s;o large, that I thought if I let my Husband &s;ee it, he might be apt to wonder what Occa&s;ion I could ever have for &s;o much, and for Plate of &s;uch a kind too; as particularly, a great Ci&s;tern for Bottles, which co&s;t a hundred and twenty Pounds, and &s;ome large Candle&s;ticks, too big for any ordinary U&s;e. The&s;e I cau&s;ed <HI>Amy</HI> to &s;ell; <HI>in &s;hort, Amy</HI> &s;old above three hundred Pounds-worth of Plate; what I gave the QUAKER, was worth above &s;ixty Pounds, and I gave <HI>Amy</HI> above thirty Pounds-worth, and yet I had a great deal left for my Husband.</P>
<P>Nor did our Kindne&s;s to the QUAKER end with the forty Pounds a Year, for we were always, while we &s;tayed with her, which was above ten Months, giving her one good Thing or another; and, <HI>in a Word,</HI> in|&s;tead of lodging with her, &s;he boarded with us, for I
<PB N="267" REF="265">
kept the Hou&s;e, and &s;he and all her Family eat and drank with us, and yet we paid her the Rent of the Hou&s;e too; <HI>in &s;hort,</HI> I remembered <HI>my Widowhood,</HI> and I made this Widow's Heart glad many a Day the more upon that Account.</P>
<P>And now my Spou&s;e and I began to think of going over to <HI>Holland,</HI> where I had propo&s;ed to him to live, and in order to &s;ettle all the Preliminaries of our future Manner of Living, I began to draw in my Effects, &s;o as to have them all at Command, upon whatever Occa&s;ion we thought fit; after which, one Morning I called my Spou&s;e up to me; hark ye, Sir, <HI>&s;aid I to him,</HI> I have two very weighty Que&s;tions to ask of you; I do not know what An&s;wer you will give to the fir&s;t, but I doubt you will be able to give but a &s;orry An&s;wer to the other, and yet, <HI>I a&s;&s;ure you,</HI> it is of the la&s;t Importance to your|&s;elf, and towards the future Part of your Life, where|ever it is to be.</P>
<P>He did not &s;eem to be much alarm'd, becau&s;e he could &s;ee I was &s;peaking in a kind of merry Way, <HI>Let's hear your Que&s;tions,</HI> my Dear, <HI>&s;ays he, and I'll give the be&s;t An&s;wer I can to them.</HI> Why fir&s;t, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. You have married a Wife here, made her a Lady, and put her in Expectation of being &s;omething el&s;e &s;till, when &s;he comes abroad; pray have you ex|amined whether you are able to &s;upply all her extra|vagant Demands when &s;he comes abroad; and main|tain an expen&s;ive <HI>Engli&s;hwoman</HI> in all her Pride and Vanity? <HI>In &s;hort,</HI> have you enquired whether you are able to keep her?</P>
<P N="2">II. You have married a Wife here, and given her a great many fine Things, and you maintain her like a Prince&s;s, and &s;ometimes call her &s;o; pray what Portion have you had with her? what Fortune has &s;he been to you? and where does her E&s;tate$ly, that you keep her &s;o fine? I am afraid you keep her in a Figure a great deal above her E&s;tate, at lea&s;t, above all that you have &s;een of it yet? Are
<PB N="268" REF="266">
you &s;ure you ha'n't got a Bite? and that you have not made a Beggar a Lady?</P>
<P>Well, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> have you any more Que&s;tions to ask? let's have them all together, perhaps they may be all an|&s;wered in a few Words, as well as the&s;e two. No, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> the&s;e are the two grand Que&s;tions, at lea&s;t, for the pre&s;ent. Why then, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I'll an&s;wer you in a few Words, That I am fully Ma&s;ter of my own Circum|&s;tances, and without farther Enquiry, can let my Wife, you &s;peak of, know, that as I have made her a Lady, I can maintain her as a Lady, wherever &s;he goes with me; and this, whether I have one Pi&s;tole of her Portion, or whether &s;he has any Portion or no: And as I have not enquired whether &s;he has any Portion or not, &s;o &s;he &s;hall not have the le&s;s Re&s;pect &s;hewed her from me, or be obliged to live meaner, or be any Ways &s;traitned on that Account; on the contrary, if &s;he goes abroad to live with me in my own Country, I will make her more than a Lady, and &s;upport the Expence of it too, with|out meddling with any Thing &s;he has; and this I &s;up|po&s;e, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> contains an An&s;wer to both your Que&s;ti|ons together.</P>
<P>He &s;poke this with a great deal more Earne&s;tne&s;s in his Countenance, than I had when I propo&s;ed my Que&s;|tions; and &s;aid a great many kind Things upon it, as the Con&s;equence of former Di&s;cour&s;es, &s;o that I was obliged to be in earne&s;t too. My Dear, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> I was but in je&s;t in my Que&s;tions; but they were propo&s;ed to introduce what I am going to &s;ay to you in earne&s;t; <HI>namely,</HI> that if I am to go abroad, 'tis Time I &s;hould let you know how Things &s;tand, and what I have to bring you with your Wife; how it is to be di&s;po&s;ed and &s;ecured, <HI>and the like;</HI> and therefore come, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> &s;it down, and let me &s;hew you your Bargain here; I hope you will find that you have not got a Wife without a Fortune.</P>
<P>He told me then, that &s;ince he found I was in earne&s;t, he de&s;ired that I would adjourn it till to morrow, and then we would do as the poor People do after they mar|ry,
<PB N="269" REF="267">
feel in their Pockets, and &s;ee how much Money they can bring together in the World; well, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> with all my Heart; and &s;o we ended our Talk for that Time.</P>
<P>As this was in the Morning, my Spou&s;e went out af|ter Dinner to his Gold&s;mith's, <HI>as he &s;aid,</HI> and about three Hours after returns with a Porter and two large Boxes with him; and his Servant brought another Box, which I ob&s;erved was almo&s;t as heavy as the two that the Porter brought, and made the poor Fellow &s;weat heartily; he di&s;mi&s;s'd the Porter, and in a little while after went out again with his Man, and returning at Night, brought another Porter with more Boxes and Bundles, and all was carried up, and put into a Chamber next to our Bed-chamber; and in the Morning he call'd for a pretty large round Table, and began to un|pack.</P>
<P>When the Boxes were opened, I found they were chiefly full of Books, and Papers, and Parchments, <HI>I mean,</HI> Books of Accompts, and Writings, <HI>and &s;uch Things,</HI> as were in them&s;elves of no Moment to me, be|cau&s;e I under&s;tood them not; but I perceived he took them all out, and &s;pread them about him upon the Ta|ble and Chairs, and began to be very bu&s;y with them; &s;o I withdrew and left him; and he was indeed &s;o bu&s;y among them, that he never mi&s;s'd me, till I had been gone a good while; but when he had gone thro' all his Papers, and come to open a little Box, he called for me again; Now, <HI>&s;ays be,</HI> and called me <HI>his Counte&s;s,</HI> I am ready to an&s;wer your fir&s;t Que&s;tion; if you will &s;it down till I have opened this Box, we will &s;ee how it &s;tands.</P>
<P>So we opened the Box; there was in it indeed what I did not expect, for I thought he had &s;unk his E&s;tate ra|ther than rai&s;ed it; but he produced me in Gold&s;miths Bills, and Stock in the <HI>Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-India-Company,</HI> a|bout &s;ixteen thou&s;and Pounds Sterling; then he gave in|to my Hands nine A&s;&s;ignments upon the Bank of <HI>Lyons in France,</HI> and two upon the Rents of the Town-hou&s;e in <HI>Paris,</HI> amounting in the whole to 5800 Crowns <HI>per</HI>
<PB N="270" REF="268">
<HI>Annum,</HI> or annual Rent, as 'tis called there; and la&s;tly, the Sum of 30000 Rixdollars in the Bank of <HI>Am&s;terdam;</HI> be&s;ides &s;ome Jewels and Gold in the Box, to the Value of about 15 or 1600 <HI>l.</HI> among which was a very good Necklace of Pearl, of about 200 <HI>l.</HI> Value; and that he pulled out, and tied about my Neck, telling me that &s;hould not be reckoned into the Account.</P>
<P>I was equally plea&s;ed and &s;urprized, and it was with an inexpre&s;&s;ible Joy that I &s;aw him &s;o rich. You might well tell me, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> that you were able to make me a Counte&s;s, and maintain me as &s;uch: In &s;hort, he was immen&s;ely rich; for be&s;ides all this, he &s;hewed me, which was the Rea&s;ons of his being &s;o bu&s;y among the Books, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> he &s;hewed me &s;everal Adventures he had abroad, in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of his Merchandize; as particu|larly, an eight Share in an <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Ship then abroad; an Account-Courant with a Merchant at <HI>Cadiz</HI> in <HI>Spain;</HI> about 3000 <HI>l.</HI> lent upon <HI>Bottomree,</HI> upon Ships gone to the <HI>Indies;</HI> and a large Cargo of Goods in a Merchant's Hands for Sale at <HI>Lisbon</HI> in <HI>Portugal;</HI> &s;o that in his Books there was about 12000 <HI>l.</HI> more; all which put together, made about 27000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling, and 1320 <HI>l.</HI> a Year.</P>
<P>I &s;tood amazed at this Account, as well I might, and &s;aid nothing to him for a good while, and the rather, becau&s;e I &s;aw him &s;till bu&s;y looking over his Books. Af|ter a while as I was going to expre&s;s my Wonder; hold, my Dear, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> this is not all neither; then he pull'd me out &s;ome old Seals, and &s;mall Parchment Rolls, which I did not under&s;tand; but he told me they were a Right of Rever&s;ion which he had to a paternal E&s;tate in his Family, and a Mortgage of 14000 Rixdollars, which he had upon it, in the Hands of the pre&s;ent Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or; &s;o that was about 3000 <HI>l.</HI> more.</P>
<P>But now hold again, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> for I mu&s;t pay my Debts out of all this, and they are very great, I a&s;&s;ure you; and the fir&s;t, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> was a black Article of 8000 Pi&s;|toles, which he had a Law-&s;uit about at <HI>Paris,</HI> but had it awarded again&s;t him, which was the Lo&s;s he had told me of, and which made him leave <HI>Paris</HI> in Di&s;gu&s;t;
<PB N="271" REF="269">
that in other Accounts he ow'd about 5300 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling; but after all this, upon the whole, he had &s;till 17000 <HI>l.</HI> clear Stock in Money, and 1320 <HI>l.</HI> a Year in Rent.</P>
<P>After &s;ome Pau&s;e, it came to my Turn to &s;peak. Well, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> 'tis very hard a Gentleman with &s;uch a Fortune as this &s;hould come over to <HI>England,</HI> and marry a Wife with nothing; it &s;hall never, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> be &s;aid; but what I have, I'll bring into the public Stock; &s;o I began to produce.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I pull'd out the Mortgage which good Sir <HI>Ro|bert</HI> had procur'd for me, the annual Rent 700 <HI>l. per A$num;</HI> the principle Money 14000 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I pull'd out another Mortgage upon Land, procured by the &s;ame faithful Friend, which at three Times had advanced 12000 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> I pull'd him out a Parcel of little Securities, procur'd by &s;everal Hands, by Fee-farm Rents, and &s;uch petty Mortgages as tho&s;e Times afforded, amount|ing to 10800 <HI>l.</HI> principle Money, and paying &s;ix hun|dred and thirty &s;ix Pounds a Year, &s;o that in the whole there was 2056 <HI>l.</HI> a Year ready Money, con&s;tantly com|ing in.</P>
<P>When I had &s;hewn him all the&s;e, I laid them upon the Table, and bade him take them, that he might be able to give me an An&s;wer to the <HI>&s;econd Que&s;tion.</HI> viz. <HI>What Fortune he had with his Wife?</HI> and laugh'd a little at it.</P>
<P>He look'd at them a while, and then handed them all back again to me; I will not touch them, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> nor one of them, till they are all &s;ettled in Tru&s;tees Hands, for your own U&s;e, and the Management wholly your own.</P>
<P>I cannot omit what happened to me while all this was acting, tho' it was chearful Work in the Main, yet I tembled every Joint of me, wor&s;e for ought I know, than ever <HI>Bel&s;hazzer</HI> did at the Hand-writing on the Wall, and the Occa&s;ion was every Way as ju&s;t. <HI>Un|happy Wretch,</HI> &s;aid I to my&s;elf, <HI>&s;hall my ill-got Wealth, the Product of</HI> pro&s;perous Lu&s;t, <HI>and of a vile and vicious Life</HI> of Whoredom and Adultery, <HI>be intermingled with the hone&s;t well-gotten E&s;tate of this innocent Gentleman,</HI>

<HI>to be a Moth and a Catterpiller among it, and bring the Judgments of Heaven upon him, and upon what he has for my Sake! Shall my Wickedne&s;s bla&s;t his Comforts!

<P>This is the true Rea&s;on why I have been &s;o particular in the Account of my va&s;t acquir'd Stock; and how his E&s;tate, which was perhaps the Product of many Years fortunate Indu&s;try; and which was equal, if not &s;upe|rior, to mine, at be&s;t, was <HI>at my Reque&s;t,</HI> kept apart from mine, <HI>as is mentioned above.</HI></P>
<P>I have told you how he gave back all my Writings into my own Hands again. Well. <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> &s;eeing you will have it be kept apart, <HI>it &s;hall be &s;o,</HI> upon one Con|dition, which I have to propo&s;e, and no other. And what is the Condition, <HI>&s;ays he?</HI> Why, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> all the Pretence I can have for the making over my own E&s;tate to me, is, that in Ca&s;e of your Mortality, I may have it re&s;erved for me, if I out-live you; well, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> that is true. But then, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> the annual Income is always re|ceived by the Husband, during his Life, as 'tis &s;uppos'd for the mutual Sub&s;i&s;tance of the Family; now, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> here is 2000 <HI>l.</HI> a Year, which I believe is as much as we &s;hall &s;pend, and I de&s;ire none of it may be &s;aved; and all the Income of your own E&s;tate, the Intere&s;t of the 17000 <HI>l.</HI> and the 1320 <HI>l.</HI> a Year may be con&s;tantly laid by for the Encrea&s;e of your E&s;tate; and &s;o, <HI>added,</HI> I, by joining the Intere&s;t every Year to the Capital, you will perhaps grow as rich as you would do if you were to trade with it all, if you were obliged to keep Hou&s;e out of it too.</P>
<P>He lik'd the Propo&s;al very well, and &s;aid it &s;hould be &s;o; and this Way I, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, &s;atisfied my&s;elf, that I &s;hould not bring my Husband under the Bla&s;t of a ju&s;t Providence, for mingling my cur&s;ed ill-gotten Wealth with his hone&s;t E&s;tate. This was occa&s;ioned by the Reflections which, at &s;ome certain Intervals of Time, came into my Thoughts of the Ju&s;tice of Heaven, which I had Rea&s;on to expect would &s;ometime or other &s;till
<PB N="273" REF="271">
fall upon me or my Effects, for the dreadful Life I had liv'd.</P>
<P>And let no Body conclude from the &s;trange Succe&s;s I met with in all my wicked Doings, and the va&s;t E&s;tate which I had rais'd by it, that therefore I either was hap|py or ea&s;y: No, no, there was a Dart &s;truck into the Liver; there was a &s;ecret Hell within, even all the while, when our Joy was at the highe&s;t; but more e&s;|pecially now, after it was all over, and when accord|ing to all Appearance, I was one of the happie&s;t Wo|men upon Earth, all this while, I &s;ay, I had &s;uch a con&s;tant Terror upon my Mind, as gave me every now and then very terrible Shocks, and which made me expect &s;omething very frightful upon every Accident of Life.</P>
<P><HI>In a Word,</HI> it never Lightn'd or Thunder'd, but I ex|pected the next Fla&s;h wou'd penetrate my Vitals, and melt the Sword <HI>[Soul]</HI> in this Scabbard of Fle&s;h; it never blew a Storm of Wind, but I expected the Fall of &s;ome Stack of Chimneys, of &s;ome Part of the Hou&s;e wou'd bury me in its Ruins; and &s;o of other Things.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall perhaps, have Occa&s;ion to &s;peak of all the&s;e Things again by and by; the Ca&s;e before us was in a Manner &s;ettled; we had full four thou&s;and Pounds <HI>per Annum</HI> for our future Sub&s;i&s;tance, be&s;ides a va&s;t Sum in Jewels and Plate; and be&s;ides this, I had about eight thou&s;and Pounds re&s;erv'd in Money, which I kept back from him, to provide for my two Daughters, of whom I have yet much to &s;ay.</P>
<P>With this E&s;tate, &s;ettl'd as you have heard, and with the be&s;t Husband in the World, I left <HI>England</HI> again; I had not only in human Prudence, and by the Na|ture of the Thing, being now marry'd and &s;ettl'd in &s;o glorious a Manner, I &s;ay, I had not only abandon'd all the gay and wicked Cour&s;e which I had gone thro|row before, but I began to look back upon it with that Horror, and that Dete&s;tation, which is the certain Companion, if not the Fore-runner, of Repentance.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="272">
Sometimes the Wonders of my pre&s;ent Circum&s;tan|ces wou'd work upon me, and I &s;hou'd have &s;ome Rap|tures upon my Soul, upon the Subject of my coming &s;o &s;moothly out of the Arms of Hell, that I was not in|gulph'd in Ruin, as mo&s;t who lead &s;uch Lives are, fir&s;t or la&s;t; but this was a Flight too high for me; I was not come to that Repentance that is rais'd from a Sen&s;e of Heaven's Goodne&s;s; I repented of the Crime, but it was of another and lower kind of Repentance, and rather mov'd by my Fears of Vengeance, than from a Sen&s;e of being &s;par'd from being puni&s;h'd, and landed &s;afe after a Storm.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Thing which happened after our coming to the <HI>Hague,</HI> (where we lodg'd for a while) was, that my Spou&s;e &s;aluted me one Morning with the Title of <HI>Counte&s;s,</HI> as he &s;aid he intended to do, by having the Inheritance to which the Honour was annex'd, made over to him. It is true, it was a Rever&s;ion, but it &s;oon fell, and in the mean Time, as all the Brothers of a <HI>Count</HI> are call'd <HI>Counts,</HI> &s;o I had the Title by Courte&s;y, about three Years before I had it in reallity.</P>
<P>I was agreeably &s;urpriz'd at this coming &s;o &s;oon, and wou'd have had my Spou&s;e have taken the Money which it co&s;t him, out of my Stock, but he laughed at me, and went on.</P>
<P>I was now in the Height of my Glory and Pro&s;peri|ty, and I was call'd the <HI>Counte&s;s de&mdash;;</HI> for I had obtain'd that unlook'd for, which I &s;ecretly aim'd at, and was really the main Rea&s;on of my coming Abroad: I took now more Servants, liv'd in a kind of Magni|ficence that I had not been acquainted with, was call'd <HI>Your Honour</HI> at every Word, and had a <HI>Coronet</HI> behind my Coach; tho' at the &s;ame Time I knew little or no|thing of my new Pedigree.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Thing that my Spou&s;e took upon him to manage, was to declare our&s;elves marry'd eleven Years before our arriving in <HI>Holland;</HI> and con&s;equently to acknowledge our little Son, who was yet in <HI>England,</HI> to be legitimate; order him to be brought over, and
<PB N="275" REF="273">
added to his Family, and acknowledge him to be our own.</P>
<P>This was done by giving Notice to his People at <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> where his Children (which were two Sons and a Daughter) were brought up; that he was come over from <HI>England;</HI> and that he was arriv'd at the <HI>Hague,</HI> with his Wife, and &s;hou'd re&s;ide there &s;ome Time; and that he wou'd have his two Sons brought down to &s;ee him, which accordingly was done, and where I entertain'd them with all the Kindne&s;s and Tenderne&s;s that they cou'd expect from their Mother-in-Law; and who pretended to be &s;o ever &s;ince they were two or three Years old.</P>
<P>This, &s;uppo&s;ing us to have been &s;o long marry'd, was not difficult at all, in a Country where we had been &s;een together about that Time, <HI>viz.</HI> eleven Years and a half before; and where we had never been &s;een afterwards, till we now return'd together; this being &s;een together, was al&s;o openly own'd, and acknow|ledg'd of Cour&s;e, by our Friend, the Merchant at <HI>Rot|terdam;</HI> and al&s;o by the People in the Hou&s;e where we both lodg'd, in the &s;ame City, and where our fir&s;t In|timacies began, and who, as it happen'd, were all a|live; and therefore to make it the more publick, we made a Tour to <HI>Rotterdam</HI> again, lodg'd in the &s;ame Hou&s;e, and was vi&s;ited there by our Friend, the Mer|chant; and afterwards invited frequently to his Hou&s;e, where he treated us very hand&s;omely</P>
<P>This Conduct of my Spou&s;e, and which he manag'd very cleverly, was indeed a Te&s;timony of a wonder|ful Degree of Hone&s;ty and Affection to our little Son; for it was done purely for the Sake of the Child.</P>
<P>I call it an hone&s;t Affection, becau&s;e it was from a Principle of Hone&s;ty that he &s;o earne&s;tly concern'd him|&s;elf, to prevent the Scandal which wou'd otherwi&s;e have fallen upon the Child, who was it&s;elf innocent; and as it was from this Principle of Ju&s;tice that he &s;o earne&s;tly &s;ollicited me, and conjur'd me by the natural Affections of a Mother, to marry him, when it was
<PB N="276" REF="274">
yet young within me, and unborn, that the Child might not &s;uffer for the Sin of its Father and Mother; &s;o tho' at the &s;ame Time, he really loved me very well, yet I had rea&s;on to believe, that it was from this Prin|ciple of Ju&s;tice to the Child, that he came to <HI>England</HI> again to &s;eek me, with De&s;ign to marry me, and, as he call'd it, &s;ave the innocent Lamb from an Infamy wor&s;e than Death.</P>
<P>It is with a ju&s;t Reproach to my&s;elf, that I mu&s;t re|peat it again, that I had not the &s;ame Concern for it, tho' it was the Child of my own Body; nor had I ever the hearty affectionate Love to the Child, that he had. What the Rea&s;on of it was, I cannot tell; and indeed, I had &s;hown a general Neglect of the Child, thro' all the gay Years of my <HI>London</HI> Revels; except that I &s;ent <HI>Amy</HI> to look upon it now and then, and to pay for its Nur&s;ing; as for me, I &s;carce &s;aw it four Times in the fir&s;t four Years of its Life, and often wi&s;h'd it wou'd go out of the World; whereas a Son which I had by the Jeweller, I took a different Care of, and &s;hew'd a dif|ferent Concern for, tho' I did not let him know me; for I provided very well for him, had him put out very well to School; and when he came to Years fit for it, let him go over with a Per&s;on of Hone&s;ty and good Bu&s;ine&s;s, to the <HI>Indies;</HI> and after he had liv'd there &s;ome Time, and began to act for him&s;elf, &s;ent him over the Value of 2000 <HI>l.</HI> at &s;everal Times, with which he traded, and grew rich; and, as 'tis to be hop'd, may at la&s;t come over again with forty or fifty thou&s;and Pounds in his Pocket, as many do who have not &s;uch Encouragement at their Beginning.</P>
<P>I al&s;o &s;ent him over a Wife, a beautiful young La|dy, well-bred, an exeeeding good natur'd plea&s;ant Crea|ture; but the nice young Fellow did not like her, and had the Impupence to write to me, <HI>that is, to the Per&s;on I employ'd to corre&s;pond with him,</HI> to &s;end him another; and promis'd, that he wou'd marry her I had &s;ent him to a Friend of his, who lik'd her better than he did; but I took it &s;o ill, that I wou'd not &s;end him another,

and withal, &s;topp'd another Article of 1000 <HI>l.</HI> which I had appointed to &s;end him: He con&s;ider'd of it after|wards, and offer'd to take her; but then truly &s;he took &s;o ill the fir&s;t Affront he put upon her, that &s;he wou'd not have him, and I &s;ent him Word, I thought &s;he was very much in the right: However, after courting her two Years, and &s;ome Friends interpo&s;ing, &s;he took him, and made him an excellent Wi&s;e, as I knew &s;he wou'd; but I never &s;ent him the thou&s;and Pound Car|goe, &s;o that he lo&s;t that Money for mi&s;u&s;ing me, and took the Lady at la&s;t without it.</P>
<P>My new Spou&s;e and I liv'd a very regular contem|plative Life, and in it&s;elf certainly a Life fill'd with all human Felicity: But if I look'd upon my pre&s;ent Si|tuation with Satisfaction, as I certainly did, &s;o in Pro|portion I on all Occa&s;ions look'd back on former Things with Dete&s;tation, and with the utmo&s;t Affliction; and now indeed, and not till now, tho&s;e Reflections began to prey upon my Comforts, and le&s;&s;en the Sweets of my other Enjoyments: They might be &s;aid to have gnaw'd a Hole in my Heart before; but now they made a Hole quite thro' it; now they eat into all my plea&s;ant Things; made bitter every Sweet, and mix'd my Sighs with every Smile.</P>
<P>Not all the Affluence of a plentiful Fortune; not a hundred thou&s;and Pounds E&s;tate; (for between us we had litt$e le&s;s) not Honour and Titles, Attendants and Equipages; in a Word, not all the Things we call Plea&s;ure, cou'd give me any reli&s;h, or &s;weeten the Ta&s;te of Things to me; at lea&s;t, not &s;o much, but I grew &s;ad, heavy, pen&s;ive, and melancholy; &s;lept little, and eat little; dream'd continually of the mo&s;t frightful and terrible Things imaginable: Nothing but Apparitions of Devils and Mon&s;ters; falling into Gulphs, and off from &s;teep and high Precipices, and the like; &s;o that in the Morning, when I &s;hou'd ri&s;e, and be refre&s;h'd with the Ble&s;&s;ing of Re&s;t, I was Hagridden with Frights, and terrible Things, form'd meerly in the Imagination; and was either tir'd, and wanted Sleep, or over-run

with Vapours, and not fit for conver&s;ing with my Fa|mily, or any one el&s;e.</P>
<P>My Husband, the tendere&s;t Creature in the World, and particularly &s;o to me, was in great Concern for me, and did every Thing that lay in his Power, to comfort and re&s;tore me; &s;trove to rea&s;on me out of it; then tried all the Ways po&s;&s;ible to divert me; but it was all to no purpo&s;e, or to but very little.</P>
<P>My only Relief was, &s;ometimes to unbo&s;om my&s;elf to poor <HI>Amy,</HI> when &s;he and I were alone; and &s;he did all &s;he cou'd to comfort me, but all was to little Effect there; for tho' <HI>Amy</HI> was the better Penitent before, when we had been in the Storm; <HI>Amy</HI> was ju&s;t where &s;he us'd to be, <HI>now,</HI> a wild, gay, loo&s;e Wretch, and not much the graver for her Age; for <HI>Amy</HI> was between forty and fifty by this Time too.</P>
<P>But to go on with my own Story; as I had no Com|forter, &s;o I had no Coun&s;ellor; it was well, as I often thought, that I was not a <HI>Roman Catholick;</HI> for what a Piece of Work &s;hou'd I have made, to have gone to a Prie&s;t with &s;uch an Hi&s;tory as I had to tell him? and what Pennance wou'd any <HI>Father-Confe&s;&s;or</HI> have oblig'd me to perform? e&s;pecially if he had been hone&s;t and true to his Office.</P>
<P>However, as I had none of the recour&s;e, &s;o I had none of the Ab&s;olution, by which the Criminal con|fe&s;&s;ing, goes away comforted; but I went about with a Heart loaded with Crime, and altogether in the dark, as to what I was to do; and in this Con|dition I langui&s;h'd near two Years; I may well call it langui&s;hing, for if Providence had not reliev'd me, I &s;hou'd have died in little Time: <HI>But of that hereafter.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t now go back to another Scene, and join it to this End of my Story, which will compleat all my Con|cern with <HI>England,</HI> at lea&s;t, all that I &s;hall bring into this Account.

But I have not gone thorow the Story of my two Daughters: I was &s;o in Danger of being known by one of them, that I dur&s;t not &s;ee her, &s;o as to let her know who I was; and for the other, I cou'd not well know how to &s;ee her, and own her, and let her &s;ee me, be|cau&s;e &s;he mu&s;t then know that I wou'd not let her Si&s;ter know me, which wou'd look &s;trange; &s;o that upon the whole, I re&s;olv'd to &s;ee neither of them at all, but <HI>Amy</HI> manag'd all that for me; and when &s;he had made Gentlewomen of them both, by giving them a good tho' late Education, &s;he had like to have blown up the whole Ca&s;e, and her&s;elf and me too, by an unhappy Di&s;covery of her&s;elf to the la&s;t of them, that is, to her who was our Cookmaid, and who, as I &s;aid before, <HI>Amy</HI> had been oblig'd to turn away, for fear of the very Di&s;covery which now happen'd: I have ob&s;erv'd al|ready in what Manner <HI>Amy</HI> manag'd her by a third Per|&s;on; and how the Girl, when &s;he was &s;et up for a La|dy as above, came and vi&s;ited <HI>Amy</HI> at my Lodgings; after which, <HI>Amy</HI> going, as was her Cu&s;tom, to &s;ee the Girl's Brother (my Son) at the hone&s;t Man's Hou&s;e in <HI>Spittle Fields;</HI> both the Girls were there, meerly by accident, at the &s;ame Time, and the other Girl una|wares di&s;cover'd the Secret, <HI>namely,</HI> that this was the Lady that had done all this for them.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was greatly &s;urpriz'd at it, but as &s;he &s;aw there was no Remedy, &s;he made a Je&s;t of it; and &s;o after that, convers'd openly, being &s;till &s;atisfied that neither of them cou'd make much of it, as long as they knew nothing of me: So &s;he took them together one Time, and told them the Hi&s;tory, as &s;he call'd it, of their Mother; beginning at the mi&s;erable carrying them to their Aunt's; &s;he own'd &s;he was not their Mother her&s;elf, but de&s;crib'd her to them: However, when &s;he &s;aid &s;he was not their Mother, one of them expre&s;s'd her&s;elf very much &s;urpriz'd, for the Girl had taken up a &s;trong Fancy that <HI>Amy</HI> was really her Mother; and that &s;he had for &s;ome particular Rea&s;ons, conceal'd it from her, and therefore when &s;he told her frankly that &s;he was not

her Mother, the Girl fell a crying, and <HI>Amy</HI> had much ado to keep Life in her: This was the Girl who was at fir&s;t my Cookmaid in the <HI>Pallmall.</HI> When <HI>Amy</HI> had brought her to again a little, and &s;he had recover'd her fir&s;t Di&s;order, <HI>Amy</HI> ask'd what ail'd her? the poor Girl hung about her, and ki&s;s'd her, and was in &s;uch a Pa&s;&s;ion &s;till, tho' &s;he was a great Wench of nineteen or twenty Years old, that &s;he cou'd not be brought to &s;peak a great while; at la&s;t, having recover'd her Speech, &s;he &s;aid &s;till, <HI>But O do not &s;ay you a'n't my Mo|ther! I'm &s;ure you are my Mother;</HI> and then the Girl cry'd again like to kill her&s;elf: <HI>Amy</HI> could not tell what to do with her a good while; &s;he was loth to &s;ay again, &s;he was not her Mother, becau&s;e &s;he wou'd not throw her into a Fit of crying again; but &s;he went round about a little with her: Why Child, &s;ays &s;he, why wou'd you have me be your Mother? If it be becau&s;e I am &s;o kind to you, be ea&s;y, my Dear, &s;ays <HI>Amy,</HI> I'il be as kind to you &s;till, as if I was your Mother.</P>
<P>Ay but, &s;ays the Girl, I am &s;ure you are my Mother too; and what have I done that you won't own me, and that you will not be call'd my Mother? tho' I am poor, you have made me a Gentlewoman, &s;ays &s;he, and I won't do any Thing to di&s;grace you; be&s;ides, adds &s;he, I can keep a Secret too, e&s;pecially for my own Mother, &s;ure; then &s;he calls <HI>Amy</HI> her Dear Mo|ther, and hung about her Neck again, crying &s;till vehemently.</P>
<P>This la&s;t Part of the Girl's Words alarm'd <HI>Amy,</HI> and, as &s;he told me, frighted her terrible; nay, &s;he was &s;o con&s;ounded with it, that &s;he was not able to govern her&s;elf, or to conceal her Di&s;order from the Girl her|&s;elf, <HI>as you &s;hall hear: Amy</HI> was at a full Stop, and confus'd to the la&s;t Degree; and the Girl a &s;harp Jade, turn'd it upon her: My Dear Mother, &s;ays &s;he, do not be unea&s;y about it; I know it all; but do not be unea&s;y, I won't let my Si&s;ter know a Word of it, or my Bro|ther either, without you give me leave, but don't di&s;|own me now you have found me; don't hide your&s;elf

<P>I think the Girl's mad, <HI>&s;ays Amy,</HI> why Child, I tell thee, if I was thy Mother I wou'd not di&s;own thee; don't you &s;ee I am as kind to you as if I was your Mo|ther? <HI>Amy</HI> might as well have &s;ung a Song to a Kettle-Drum, as talk to her: Yes, &s;ays the Girl, you are ve|ry good to me indeed; and that was enough to make any Body believe &s;he was her Mother too; but however, that was not the Ca&s;e, &s;he had other Rea&s;ons to believe, and to know that &s;he was her Mother, and it was a &s;ad Thing &s;he wou'd not let her call her Mother, who was her own Child.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was &s;o Heart-full with the Di&s;turbance of it, that &s;he did not enter farther with her into the Enquiry, as &s;he wou'd otherwi&s;e have done, I mean, as to what made the Girl &s;o po&s;itive, but comes away, and tells me the whole Story.</P>
<P>I was Thunder &s;truck with the Story at fir&s;t, and much more afterwards, <HI>as you &s;hall hear;</HI> but, I &s;ay, I was Thunder-&s;truck at fir&s;t, and amaz'd, and &s;aid to <HI>Amy,</HI> There mu&s;t be &s;omething or other in it more than we know of; but having examin'd farther into it, I found the Girl had no Notion of any Body, but of <HI>Amy,</HI> and glad I was that I was not concern'd in the Pretence, and that the Girl had no Notion of me in it: But even this Ea&s;ine&s;s did not continue long, for the next Time <HI>Amy</HI> went to &s;ee her, &s;he was the &s;ame Thing, and ra|ther more violent with <HI>Amy</HI> than &s;he was before: <HI>Amy</HI> endeavour'd to pacify her by all the Ways imaginable; <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> &s;he told her, &s;he took it ill that &s;he wou'd not be|lieve her; and told her, if &s;he wou'd not give over &s;uch a fooli&s;h Whim&s;y, &s;he wou'd leave her to the wide World, as &s;he found her.</P>
<P>This put the Girl into Fits, and &s;he cry'd ready to kill her&s;elf, and hung about <HI>Amy</HI> again, like a Child: Why, <HI>&s;ays Amy,</HI> why can you not be ea&s;y with me then, and compo&s;e your&s;elf, and let me go on to do you good, and &s;how you Kindne&s;s, as I wou'd do, and as I intend to do?

would not tell you &s;o? What Whim&s;y is this that po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es your Mind? <HI>&s;ays Amy:</HI> Well, the Girl told her in a few Words, but tho&s;e few &s;uch as frighted <HI>Amy</HI> out of her Wits, and me too: That &s;he knew well enough how it was; I know &s;ays &s;he, when you left&mdash;, <HI>naming the Village,</HI> where I liv'd when my Father went away from us all, that you went over to <HI>France,</HI> I know that too, and who you went with, <HI>&s;ays the Girl;</HI> did not my Lady <HI>Roxana</HI> come back again with you? I know it all well enough, tho' I was but a Child, I have heard it all.&mdash;And thus &s;he run on with &s;uch Di&s;|cour&s;e, as put <HI>Amy</HI> out of all Temper again; and &s;he rav'd at her like a <HI>Bedlam,</HI> and told her, &s;he wou'd never come near her any more; &s;he might go a begging again if &s;he wou'd; &s;he'd have nothing to do with her: The Girl, a pa&s;&s;ionate Wench, <HI>told her,</HI> &s;he knew the wor&s;t of it, &s;he cou'd go to Service again, and if &s;he wou'd not own her own Child, &s;he mu&s;t do as &s;he plea&s;ed: then &s;he fell into a Pa&s;&s;ion of crying again, as if &s;he wou'd kill her&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>In &s;hort,</HI> this Girl's Conduct terrify'd <HI>Amy</HI> to the la&s;t Degree, and me too, and was it not that we knew the Girl was quite wrong in &s;ome Things, &s;he was yet &s;o right in &s;ome other, that it gave me a great deal of Per|plexity; but that which put <HI>Amy</HI> the mo&s;t to it, was, that the Girl <HI>(my Daughter)</HI> told her, that &s;he, <HI>(mean|ing me her Mother)</HI> had gone away with the <HI>Jeweller,</HI> and into <HI>France</HI> too; &s;he did not call him <HI>the Jeweller,</HI> but with the Landlord of the Hou&s;e; who, after her Mother fell into Di&s;tre&s;s, and that <HI>Amy</HI> had taken all the Children from her, made much of her, and after|wards marry'd her.</P>
<P><HI>In &s;hort,</HI> it was plain the Girl had but a broken Ac|count of things, but yet, that &s;he had receiv'd &s;ome Ac|counts that had a Reallity in the Bottom of them; &s;o that it &s;eems our fir&s;t Mea&s;ures, and the Amour with the <HI>Jew|eller,</HI> were not &s;o conceal'd as I thought they had been; and it &s;eems came in a broken Manner to my Si&s;ter in Law, who <HI>Amy</HI> carry'd the Children to, and &s;he made &s;ome Bu&s;tle, it &s;eems, about it; but as good Luck was,

it was too late, and I was remov'd, and gone, none knew whither; or el&s;e &s;he wou'd have &s;ent all the Chil|dren home to me again, to be &s;ure.</P>
<P>This we pick'd out of the Girl's Di&s;cour&s;e, that is to &s;ay, <HI>Amy</HI> did at &s;everal Times; but it all con&s;i&s;ted of broken Fragments of Stories, &s;uch as the Girl her&s;elf had heard &s;o long ago, that &s;he her&s;elf cou'd make very little of it; only that in the Main, that her Mother had play'd the Whore; had gone away with the Gentleman that was Landlord of the Hou&s;e; that he married her; that &s;he went into <HI>France.</HI> And as &s;he had learn'd in my Family, where &s;he was a Servant, that Mrs. <HI>Amy</HI> and her Lady <HI>Roxana</HI> had been in <HI>France</HI> together; &s;o &s;he put all the&s;e Things together, and joining them with the great Kindne&s;s that <HI>Amy</HI> now &s;hew'd her, po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the Creature that <HI>Amy</HI> was really her Mother; nor was it po&s;&s;ible for <HI>Amy</HI> to conquer it for a long Time.</P>
<P>But this, after I had &s;earch'd into it as far as by <HI>Amy's</HI> Relation.

<P>The poor Girl cry'd mo&s;t lamentably, but would not be beaten out of it &s;till; but that which dum-founded <HI>A|my</HI> more than all the re&s;t, was, that when &s;he had rated the poor Girl a long Time, and could not beat her out of it, and had, <HI>as I have ob&s;erved,</HI> threatned to leave her, the Girl kept to what &s;he had &s;aid before, and put this Turn to it again; that &s;he was &s;ure, if <HI>A|my</HI> wa'n't, my Lady <HI>Roxana</HI> was, her Mother, and that &s;he would go find her out; <HI>adding,</HI> that &s;he made
<PB N="286" REF="284">
no Doubt but that &s;he could do it, for &s;he knew where to enquire the Name of her new Husband.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> came Home with this Piece of News in her Mouth to me. I could ea&s;ily perceive when &s;he came in that &s;he was mad in her Mind, and in a Rage at &s;ome|thing or other, and was in great Pain to get it out; for when &s;he came fir&s;t in my Husband was in the Room. However, <HI>Amy</HI> going up to undre&s;s her, I &s;oon made an Excu&s;e to follow her, and coming into the Room; what the D&mdash;l is the Matter, <HI>Amy? &s;ays I,</HI> I am &s;ure you have &s;ome bad News. News, <HI>&s;ays Amy, aloud,</HI> ay, &s;o I have; I think the D&mdash;l is in that young Wench, &s;he will ruin us all, and her&s;elf too, there is no quieting her: So &s;he went on and told me all the Particulars; but &s;ure nothing was &s;o a&s;toni&s;hed as I was, when &s;he told me that the Girl knew I was married, that &s;he knew my Husband's Name, and would endeavour to find me out. I thought I &s;hould have &s;unk down at the very Words. In the middle of all my Amazement, <HI>Amy</HI> &s;tarts up, and runs about the Room like a di&s;tracted Bo|dy, I'll put an End to it, that I will, I cannot bear it, I mu&s;t murther her, I'll kill her B&mdash;, <HI>and &s;wears by her Maker in the mo&s;t &s;erious Tone in the World;</HI> and then repeated it over three or four Times, walking to and again in the Room; I will, in &s;hort, I will kill her, if there was not another Wench in the World.</P>
<P>Prithee hold thy Tongue, <HI>Amy, &s;ays I,</HI> why thou art mad; ay, &s;o I am, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> &s;tark-mad, but I'll be the Death of her for all that, and then I &s;hall be &s;ober a|gain. But you &s;han't, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> you &s;han't hurt a Hair of her Head; why you ought to be hanged for what you have done already; for having re&s;olved on it, is doing it, as to the Guilt of the Fact; you are a Murtherer already, as much as if you had done it already.</P>
<P>I know that, <HI>&s;ays Amy,</HI> and it can be no wor&s;e; I'll put you out of your Pain, and her too, &s;he &s;hall never challenge you for her Mother in this World, whatever &s;he may in the next. Well, well, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> be quiet, and do not talk thus, I can't bear it; &s;o &s;he grew a little &s;oberer after a while.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="285">
I mu&s;t acknowledge the Notion of being di&s;covered carried with it &s;o many frightful Ideas, and hurried my Thoughts &s;o much, that I was &s;care my&s;elf, any more than <HI>Amy,</HI> &s;o dreadful a Thing is a Load of Guilt upon the Mind.</P>
<P>And yet when <HI>Amy</HI> began the &s;econd Time, to talk thus abominably of killing the poor Child, of murther|ing her, and &s;wore by her Maker that &s;he would, &s;o that I began to &s;ee that &s;he was in earne&s;t, I was far|ther terrify'd a great deal, and it help'd to bring me to my&s;elf again in other Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>We laid our Head together then, to &s;ee if it was po&s;|&s;ible to di&s;cover by what Means &s;he had learned to talk &s;o, and how &s;he <HI>(I mean my Girl)</HI> came to know that her Mother had married a Husband; but it would not do, the Girl would acknowledge nothing, and gave but a very imperfect Account of Things &s;till, being di&s;gu&s;t|ed to the la&s;t Degree with <HI>Amy</HI>'s leaving her &s;o abruptly as &s;he did.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>Amy</HI> went to the Hou&s;e where the Boy was, but it was all one; there they had only heard a confus'd Story of the Lady <HI>&s;omebody,</HI> they knew not who, which this &s;ame Wench had told them, but they gave no Heed to it at all. <HI>Amy</HI> told them how fooli&s;hly the Girl had acted, and how &s;he had carried on the Whim&s;y &s;o far, in Spight of all they could &s;ay to her; that &s;he had tak|en it &s;o ill, &s;he would &s;ee her no more, and &s;o &s;he might e'en go to Service again if &s;he would, for &s;he <HI>(Amy)</HI> would have nothing to do with her, unle&s;s &s;he humbled her&s;elf, and changed her Note, and that quickly too.</P>
<P>The good old Gentleman, who had been the Bene|factor to them all, was greatly concerned at it, and the good Woman his Wife was grieved beyond all expre&s;|&s;ing, and begg'd her Lady&s;hip, <HI>meaning</HI> Amy, not to $re&s;ent it; they promi&s;ed too they would talk with her about it; and the old Gentlewoman added, <HI>with &s;ome A&s;toni&s;hment,</HI> &s;ure &s;he cannot be &s;uch a Fool but &s;he will be prevailed with to hold her Tongue, when &s;he has it from your own Mouth that you are not her Mother, and &s;ees that it di&s;obliges your Lady&s;hip to have her in&s;i&s;t
<PB N="288" REF="286">
uqon it; and &s;o <HI>Amy</HI> came away with &s;ome Expectation that it would be &s;topped here.</P>
<P>But the Girl was &s;uch a Fool for all that, and per&s;i&s;t|ed in it ob&s;tinately, notwith&s;tanding all they could &s;ay to her; nay, her Si&s;ter begg'd and intreated her not to play the Fool, for that it would ruin her too; and that the Lady <HI>(meaning</HI> Amy) would abandon them both.</P>
<P>Well, notwith&s;tanding this, &s;he in&s;i&s;ted, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> upon it, and which was wor&s;e, the longer it la&s;ted, the more &s;he began to drop <HI>Amy</HI>'s Lady&s;hip, and would have it that the Lady <HI>Roxana</HI> was her Mother, and that &s;he had made &s;ome Enquiries about it, and did not doubt but &s;he &s;hould find her out.</P>
<P>When it was come to this, and we found there was nothing to be done with the Girl, but that &s;he was &s;o ob&s;tinately bent upon the Search after me, that &s;he ven|tur'd to forfeit all &s;he had in View; <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> when I found it was come to this, I began to be more &s;erious in my Preparations of my going beyond Sea; and particularly, it gave me &s;ome Rea&s;on to fear that there was &s;omething in it; but the following Accident put me be&s;ide all my Mea&s;ures, and &s;truck me into the greate&s;t Confu&s;ion that ever I was in, in my Life.</P>
<P>I was &s;o near going abroad, that my Spou&s;e and I had taken Mea&s;ures for our going off; and becau&s;e I would be &s;ure not to go too public, but &s;o as to take a|way all Po&s;&s;ibility of being &s;een, I had made &s;ome Ex|ception to my Spou&s;e again&s;t goint in the ordinary pub|lic Pa&s;&s;age-Boats. My Pretence to him, was, the pro|mi&s;cuous Crowds in tho&s;e Ve&s;&s;els, want of Convenience, <HI>and the like;</HI> &s;o he took the Hint, and found me out an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchant-Ship, which was bound for <HI>Rotter|dam,</HI> and getting &s;oon acquainted with the Ma&s;ter, he hired his whole Ship, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> his Great-Cabbin, for I do not mean his Ship for Freight. So that we had all the Conveniencies po&s;&s;ible for our Pa&s;&s;age; and all Things being near ready, he brought Home the Cap|tain one Day to Dinner with him, that I might &s;ee him, and be acquainted a little with him; &s;o we came, after Dinner, to talk of the Ship, and the Conveniencies on
<PB N="289" REF="287">
Board, and the Captain pre&s;s'd me earne&s;tly to come on Board, and &s;ee the Ship, intimating, that he would treat us as well as he could; and in Di&s;cour&s;e I happened to &s;ay, I hop'd he had no other Pa&s;&s;engers; <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> No, he had not; but, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> his Wife had courted him a good while to let her go over to <HI>Holland</HI> with him, for he always us'd that Trade, but he never could think of venturing all he had in one Bottom; but if I went with him, he thought to take her and her Kin&s;woman along with him this Voyage, that they might both wait upon me; <HI>and &s;o added,</HI> that if we would do him the Ho|nour to dine on Board the next Day, he would bring his Wife on Board, the better to make us welcome.</P>
<P>Who could have believed the Devil had any Snare at the Bottom of all this? or that I was in any Danger on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion, &s;o remote and out of the Way as this was? But the Event was the odde&s;t that could be thought of: As it happened, <HI>Amy</HI> was not at Home when we ac|cepted this Invitation, and &s;o &s;he was left out of the Company; but in&s;tead of <HI>Amy,</HI> we took our hone&s;t, good-humoured, never-to-be-omitted Friend the QUAK|ER, one of the be&s;t Creatures that ever liv'd, &s;ure; and who, be&s;ides a thou&s;and good Qualities unmix'd with one bad one, was particularly excellent for being the be&s;t Company in the World; tho' I think I had carried <HI>Amy</HI> too, if &s;he had not been engaged in this unhappy Girl's Affair; for on a &s;udden the Girl was lo&s;t, and no News was to be heard of her, and <HI>Amy</HI> had hunted her to every Place &s;he could think of, that it was likely to find her in, but all the News &s;he could hear of her, was, That &s;he was gone to an old Comrade's Hou&s;e of hers, whom &s;he call'd Si&s;ter, and who was married to a Ma&s;|ter of a Ship at <HI>Redriff,</HI> and even this the Jade never told me. It &s;eems when this Girl was directed by <HI>Amy</HI> to get her &s;ome Breeding, go to the Boarding-School, <HI>and the like,</HI> &s;he was recommended to a Boarding-School at <HI>Camberwell,</HI> and there &s;he contracted an Acquaint|ance with a young Lady <HI>(&s;o they are all called)</HI> her Bed|fellow, that they called Si&s;ters, and promi&s;ed never to break off their Acquaintance.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="288">
But judge you what an unaccountable Surprize I mu&s;t be in when I came on Board the Ship, and was brought into the Captain's Cabbin, or, <HI>what they call it,</HI> the Great-Cabbin of the Ship, to &s;ee his Lady or Wife, and another young Per&s;on with her, who, when I came to &s;ee her near-hand, was my old Cook-maid in the <HI>Pall|mall,</HI> and as appeared by the Sequel of the Story, was neither more or le&s;s than my own Daughter; that I knew her was out of Doubt; for tho' &s;he had not had Oppor|tunity to &s;ee me very often, yet I had often &s;een her, <HI>as I mu&s;t needs,</HI> being in my own Family &s;o long.</P>
<P>If ever I had need of Courage, and a full Pre&s;ence of Mind, it was now; it was the only valuable Secret in the World to me, all depended upon this Occa&s;ion; if the Girl knew me, I was undone; and to di&s;cover any Surprize or Di&s;order, had been to make her know me, or gue&s;s it, and di&s;cover her&s;elf.</P>
<P>I was once going to feign a &s;wooning and fainting a|way, and &s;o falling on the Ground, or Floor, put them all into a Hurry and Fright, and by that Means get an Opportunity to be continually holding &s;omething to my No&s;e to &s;mell to, and &s;o hold my Hand or my Hand|kerchief, or both, before my Mouth; then pretend I could not bear the Smell of the Ship, or the Clo&s;ene&s;s of the Cabbin; but that would have been only to re|move into a clearer Air upon the Quarter-deck, where we &s;hould with it, have had a clearer Light too; and if I had pretended the Smell of the Ship, it would have &s;erved only to have carried us all on Sh$re to the Captain's Hou&s;e, which was hard by; for the Ship lay &s;o clo&s;e to the Shore, that we only walked over a Plank to go on Board, and over another Ship which lay with|in her; &s;o this not appearing &s;ea&s;ible, and the Thought not being two Minutes old, there was no Time; for the two Ladies ro&s;e up, and we &s;aluted, &s;o that I was bound to come &s;o near <HI>my Girl,</HI> as to ki&s;s her, which I would not have done, had it been po&s;&s;ible to have avoided it; but there was no Room to e&s;cape.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="289">
I cannot but take Notice here, that notwith&s;tanding there was a &s;ecret Horror upon my Mind, and I was ready to &s;ink when I came clo&s;e to her to &s;alute her; yet it was a &s;ecret inconceivable Plea&s;ure to me when I ki&s;s'd her, to know that I ki&s;s'd my own Child, my own Fle&s;h and Blood, born of my Body, and who I had never ki&s;s'd &s;ince I took the fatal Farewel of them all, with a Million of Tears, and a Heart almo&s;t dead with Grief, when <HI>Amy</HI> and the good Woman took them all away, and went with them to <HI>Spittle fields.</HI> No Pen can de&s;cribe, no Words can expre&s;s, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> the &s;trange Impre&s;&s;ion which this Thing made upon my Spirits, I felt &s;omething &s;hoot thro' my Blood, my Heart fluttered, my Head fla&s;h'd, and was dizzy, and all within me, <HI>as I thought,</HI> turned about, and much ado I had not to abandon my&s;elf to an Exce&s;s of Pa&s;&s;ion at the fir&s;t Sight of her, much more when my Lips touched her Face; I thought I mu&s;t have taken her in my Arms, and ki&s;s'd her again a thou&s;and Times, whether I would or no.</P>
<P>But I rouz'd up my Judgment, and &s;hook it off, and with infinite Unea&s;ine&s;s in my Mind I &s;at down: You will not wonder, if upon this Surprize I was not con|ver&s;ible for &s;ome Minutes, and that the Di&s;order had al|mo&s;t di&s;covered it&s;elf. I had a Complication of &s;evere Things upon me, I could not conceal my Di&s;order with|out the utmo&s;t Difficulty, and yet upon my concealing it depended the whole of my Pro&s;perity, &s;o I u&s;ed all Manner of Violence with my &s;elf to prevent the Mi&s;chief which was at the Door.</P>
<P>Well, I &s;aluted her; but as I went fir&s;t forward to the Captain's Lady, who was at the farther End of the Cabbin, towards the Light, I had the Occa&s;ion offered to &s;tand with my Back to the Light, when I turned a|bout to her, who &s;tood more on my Left-hand, &s;o that &s;he had not a fair Sight of me, tho' I was &s;o near her. I trembled, and knew neither what I did or &s;aid, I was in the utmo&s;t Extremity, between &s;o many particular Circum&s;tances as lay upon me, for I was to conceal my Di&s;order from every Body, at the utmo&s;t Peril, and at the &s;ame Time expected every Body would di&s;cern it;
<PB N="292" REF="290">
I was to expect &s;he would di&s;cover that &s;he knew me; and yet was, by all Means po&s;&s;ible, to prevent it. I was to conceal my&s;elf, if po&s;&s;ible, and yet had not the lea&s;t Room to do any Thing towards it; <HI>in &s;hort,</HI> there was no Retreat, no &s;hifting any Thing off, no avoiding or preventing her having a full Sight of me, nor was there any counterfeiting my Voice, for then my Husband would have perceived it; <HI>in &s;hort,</HI> there was not the lea&s;t Circum&s;tance that offered me any A&s;&s;i&s;tance, or any favourable Thing to help me in this Exigence.</P>
<P>After I had been upon the Rack for near half an Hour, during which I appeared &s;tiff and re&s;erved, and a little too formal, my Spou&s;e and the Captain fell into Di&s;|cour&s;es about the Ship and the Sea, and Bu&s;ine&s;s remote from us Women; and by and by the Captain carried him out upon the Quarter-deck, and left us all by our|&s;elves in the Great-Cabbin: Then we began to be a little freer one with another, and I began to be a little re|viv'd by a &s;udden Fancy of my own, <HI>namely,</HI> I thought I perceived that the Girl did not know me; and the chief Rea&s;on of my having &s;uch a Notion, was, becau&s;e I did not perceive the lea&s;t Di&s;order in her Countenance, or the lea&s;t Change in her Carriage, no Confu&s;ion no He|&s;itation in her Di&s;cour&s;e; <HI>nor,</HI> which I had my Eye par|ticularly upon, did I ob&s;erve that &s;he fix'd her Eyes much upon me, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> not &s;ingling me out to look &s;teddily at me, as I thought would have been the Ca&s;e; but that &s;he rather &s;ingled out my Friend the QUAKER, and chatted with her on &s;everal Things; but I ob&s;erved too, that it was all about indifferent Matters.</P>
<P>This greatly encouraged me, and I began to be a little chearful; but I was knock'd down again as with a Thunder-Clap, when turning to the Captain's Wife, and di&s;cour&s;ing of me, <HI>&s;he &s;aid to her,</HI> Si&s;ter, I cannot but think <HI>(my Lady)</HI> to be very much like &s;uch a Per&s;on, <HI>then &s;he nam'd the Per&s;on;</HI> and the Captain's Wife &s;aid, <HI>&s;he thought &s;o too;</HI> the Girl replied again, <HI>&s;he was &s;ure &s;he had &s;een me before, but &s;he could not recollect where;</HI> I an&s;wered, (tho' her Speech was not directed to me)
<PB N="293" REF="291">
<HI>That I fancy'd &s;he had not &s;een me before in</HI> England, but ask'd if &s;he had lived in <HI>Holland,</HI> She &s;aid, <HI>No, no, &s;he had never been out of</HI> England; and I added, <HI>That &s;he could not then have known me in</HI> England, <HI>unle&s;s it was very lately, for I had liv'd at</HI> Rotterdam <HI>a great while.</HI> This carried me out of that Part of the Broil, pretty well; and to make it go off the better, when a little <HI>Dutch</HI> Boy came into the Cabbin, who belong'd to the Captain, and who I ea&s;ily perceiv'd to be <HI>Dutch,</HI> I je&s;ted, and talk'd <HI>Dutch</HI> to him, and was merry about the Boy, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> as merry as the Con&s;ternation I was &s;till in would let me be.</P>
<P>However, I began to be thorowly convinced by this Time, that the Girl did not know me, which was an in&s;inite Satisfaction to me; or, <HI>at lea&s;t,</HI> that tho' &s;he had &s;ome Notion of me, yet that &s;he did not think any Thing about my being who I was, and which perhaps, &s;he would have been as glad to have known, as I would have been &s;urpriz'd if &s;he had; indeed it was evident that had &s;he &s;u&s;pected any Thing of the Truth, &s;he would not have been able to have conceal'd it.</P>
<P>Thus this Meeting went off, and, <HI>you may be &s;ure,</HI> I was re&s;olved, if once I got off of it, &s;he &s;hould never &s;ee me again, to revive her Fancy; but I was mi&s;taken there too, <HI>as you &s;hall hear.</HI> After we had been on Board, the Captain's Lady carried us Home to her Hou&s;e, which was but ju&s;t on Shore, and treated us there again very hand&s;omely, and made us promi&s;e that we would come again and &s;ee her before we went, to concert our Af|fairs for the Voyage, <HI>and the like;</HI> for &s;he a&s;&s;ured ns, that both &s;he and her Si&s;ter went the Voyage at that Time, for our Company; and I thought to my&s;elf, <HI>Then you'll never go the Voyage at all;</HI> for I &s;aw from that Moment, that it would be no Way convenient for <HI>my Lady&s;hip</HI> to go with them; for that frequent Con|ver&s;ation might bring me to her Mind, and &s;he would certainly claim her Kindred to me in a few Days, as in|deed would have been the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>It is hardly po&s;&s;ible for me to conceive what would have been our Part in this Affair, had my Woman <HI>Amy</HI>
<PB N="294" REF="292">
gone with me on Board this Ship, it had certainly blown up the whole Affair, and I mu&s;t for ever after have been this Girl's Va&s;&s;al, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> have let her into the Secret, and tru&s;ted to her keeping it too, or have been expo&s;ed and undone. <HI>The very Thought filled me with Horror.</HI></P>
<P>But I was not &s;o unhappy neither, as it &s;ell out, for <HI>Amy</HI> was not with us, and that was my Deliverance in|deed; yet we had another Chance to get over &s;oill. As I re&s;olved to put off the Voyage, &s;o I re&s;olved to put off the Vi&s;it, <HI>you may be &s;ure;</HI> going upon this Principle <HI>namely,</HI> that I was fix'd in it, that the Girl had &s;een her la&s;t of me, and &s;hould never &s;ee me more.</P>
<P>However, to bring my&s;elf well off, and withal to &s;ee (if I could) a little farther into the Matter, I &s;ent my Friend the QUAKER, to the Captain's Lady, to make the Vi&s;it promi&s;ed, and to make my Excu&s;e that I could not po&s;&s;ibly wait on her, for that I was very much out of Order; and in the End of the Di&s;cour&s;e, I bade her in&s;inuate to them, that &s;he was afraid I &s;hould not be able to get ready to go the Voyage, &s;o &s;oon as the Cap|tain would be obliged to go; and that perhaps we might put it off to his next Voyage: I did not let the QUAKER into any other Rea&s;on for it, than that I was indi&s;po&s;ed; and not knowing what other Face to put upon that Part, I made her believe that I thought I was a breed|ing.</P>
<P>It was ea&s;y to put that into her Head, and &s;he of Cour&s;e hinted to the Captain's Lady, that &s;he found me &s;o very ill, that &s;he was afraid I would mi&s;carry, and then, <HI>to be &s;ure,</HI> I could not think of going.</P>
<P>She went, and &s;he manag'd that Part very dexterou&s;ly, <HI>as I knew &s;he would,</HI> tho' &s;he knew not a Word of the grand Rea&s;on of my Indi&s;po&s;ition; but I was all &s;unk, and dead-hearted again, when &s;he told me, She could not under&s;tand the Meaning of one Thing in her Vi&s;it, <HI>namely,</HI> That the young Woman, <HI>as &s;he call'd her,</HI> that was with the Captain's Lady, and who &s;he call'd Si&s;ter, was mo&s;t impertinently inqui&s;itive into Things; as who I was? how long I had been in <HI>England?</HI> Where I had
<PB N="295" REF="293">
liv'd? <HI>and the like;</HI> and that, <HI>above all the re&s;t,</HI> &s;he en|quir'd if I did not live once at the other End of the Town.</P>
<P>I thought her Enquiries &s;o out of the Way, <HI>&s;ays the ho|ne&s;t</HI> QUAKER, that I gave her not the lea&s;t Satisfaction; but as I &s;aw by <HI>thy</HI> An&s;wers on Board the Ship, when &s;he talk'd of <HI>thee,</HI> that <HI>thou</HI> did'&s;t not incline to let her be acqu inted with <HI>thee,</HI> &s;o I was re&s;olved that &s;he &s;hould not be much the wi&s;er for me; and when &s;he ask'd me if <HI>thou</HI> ever liv'd'&s;t <HI>here</HI> or <HI>there,</HI> I always &s;aid <HI>No;</HI> but that <HI>thou</HI> wa&s;t a <HI>Dutch</HI> Lady, and was going Home a|gain to <HI>thy</HI> Family, and liv'd abroad.</P>
<P>I thank'd her very heartily for that Part, and indeed, &s;he &s;erv'd me in it, more than I let her know &s;he did; <HI>in a Word,</HI> &s;he thwarted the Girl &s;o cleverly, that if &s;he had known the whole Affair, &s;he could not have done it better.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t acknowledge, all this put me upon the Rack again, and I was quite di&s;courag'd, not at all doubting but that the Jade had a right Scent of Things, and that &s;he knew and remembered my Face, but had artfully conceal'd her Knowledge of me, till &s;he might perhaps, do it more to my Di&s;advantage: I told all this to <HI>Amy, for &s;he was all the Relief I had:</HI> The poor Soul <HI>(Amy)</HI> was ready to hang her&s;elf, that, <HI>as &s;he &s;aid,</HI> &s;he had been the Occa&s;ion of it all; and that if I was ruin'd, <HI>(which was the Word I always us'd to her)</HI> &s;he had ruin'd me; and &s;he tormented her&s;elf about it &s;o much, that I was &s;ometimes fain to comfort her and my&s;elf too.</P>
<P>What <HI>Amy</HI> vex'd her&s;elf at, was chiefly, that &s;he &s;hould be &s;urprized &s;o by the Girl, <HI>as &s;he called her,</HI> I mean &s;urprized into a Di&s;covery of her&s;elf to the Girl; which indeed was a fal&s;e Step of <HI>Amy</HI>'s, and &s;o I had often told her, but 'twas to no Purpo&s;e to talk of that now, the Bu&s;ine&s;s was, how to get clear of the Girl's Su&s;picions, and of the Girl too, for it look'd more threatning every Day than other; and if I was unea&s;y at what <HI>Amy</HI> had told me of her rambling and rattling to her, <HI>(Amy)</HI> I had a thou&s;and Times as much Rea&s;on to be unea&s;y <HI>now,</HI>
<PB N="296" REF="294">
when &s;he had chopp'd upon me &s;o unhappily as this; and not only had &s;een my Face, but knew too where I liv'd, what Name I went by, <HI>and the like.</HI></P>
<P>And I am not come to the wor&s;t of it yet neither; for a few Days after my Friend the QUAKER had made her Vi&s;it, and excu&s;ed me on the Account of my Indi&s;|po&s;ition, as if they had done it in over and above Kind|ne&s;s, becau&s;e they had been told I was not well, they comes both directly to my Lodgings, to vi&s;it me; the Captain's Wife, and my Daughter, <HI>(who &s;he called Si&s;|ter)</HI> and the Captain to &s;hew them the Place; the Cap|tain only brought them to the Door, put them in, and went away upon &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Had not the kind QUAKER, in a lucky Moment, come running in before them, they had not only clapp'd in upon me, in the Parlour, <HI>as it had been a Surprize,</HI> but which would have been a thou&s;and Times wor&s;e, had &s;een <HI>Amy</HI> with me; I think if that had happened, I had had no Remedy, but to take the Girl by her&s;elf, and have made my&s;elf known to her, which would have been all Di&s;traction.</P>
<P>But the QUAKER, a lucky Creature to me, happened to &s;ee them come to the Door, before they rung the Bell, and in&s;tead of going to let them in, came running in, with &s;ome Confu&s;ion in her Countenance, and told me who was a coming; at which, <HI>Amy</HI> run fir&s;t, and I af|ter her, and bid the QUAKER come up as &s;oon as &s;he had let them in.</P>
<P>I was going to bid her deny me, but it came into my Thoughts, that having been repre&s;ented &s;o much cut of Order, it would have look'd very odd; be&s;ides, I knew the hone&s;t QUAKER, tho' &s;he would do any Thing el&s;e for me, would not LYE for me, and it would have been hard to have de&s;ir'd it of her.</P>
<P>After &s;he had let them in, and brought them into the Parlour, &s;he came up to <HI>Amy</HI> and I, who were hardly out of the Fright, and yet were congratulating one an|other, that <HI>Amy</HI> was not &s;urpriz'd again.</P>
<P>They paid their Vi&s;it in Form, and I received them as formally; but took Occa&s;ion two or three Times to
<PB N="297" REF="295">
Kint, that I was &s;o ill that I was afraid I &s;hou'd not be able to go to <HI>Holland,</HI> at lea&s;t, not &s;o &s;oon as the Cap|tain mu&s;t go off; and made my Compliment, how &s;or|ry I was to be di&s;appointed of the Advantage of their Company and A&s;ti&s;tance in the Voyage; and &s;ometimes I talk'd as if I thought I might &s;tay till the Captain return'd, and wou'd be ready to go again; then the QUAKER put in, That then I might be too far gone, <HI>meaning with Child,</HI> that I &s;hou'd not venture at all; and then <HI>(as if &s;he &s;hou'd be pleas'd with it) added,</HI> She hop'd I wou'd &s;tay and lye in at her Hou&s;e; &s;o as this carried its own Face with it, 'twas well enough.</P>
<P>But it was now high Time to talk of this to my Husband, which however, was not the greate&s;t Dif|ficulty before me: For after this and other Chat had taken up &s;ome Time, the young Fool began her Tat|tle again; and two or three Times &s;he brought it in, That I was &s;o like a Lady that &s;he had the Honour to know at the other End of the Town, that &s;he cou'd not put the Lady out of her Mind, when I was by, and once or twice I fancy'd the Girl was ready to cry, by and by &s;he was at it again; and at la&s;t, I plainly few Tears in her Eyes; upon which, <HI>I ask'd her if the lady was dead, becau&s;e &s;he &s;eem'd to be in &s;ome Concern for her;</HI> &s;he made me much ea&s;ier by her An&s;wer, than ever &s;he did before: <HI>She &s;aid, She did not really know, but &s;he believ'd &s;he was dead.</HI></P>
<P>This, I &s;ay, a little reliev'd my Thoughts, but I was &s;oon down again; for after &s;ome Time, the Jude began to grow Talkative; and as it was plain, that &s;he had told all that her Head cou'd retain of <HI>Roxana,</HI> and the Days of Joy which I had &s;pent at that Part of the Town, another Accident had like to have blown us all up again.</P>
<P>I was in a kind of <HI>Di&s;habille</HI> when they came, hav|ing on a loo&s;e Robe, like a Morning Gown, but much after the <HI>Italian</HI> Way; and I had not alter'd it when I went up, only dre&s;s'd my Head a little; and as I had
<PB N="298" REF="296">
been repre&s;ented as having been lately very ill, &s;o the Dre&s;s was becoming enough for a Chamber.</P>
<P>This Morning Ve&s;t, or Robe, call it as you plea&s;e, was more &s;hap'd to the Body, than we wear them &s;ince, &s;howing the Body in its true Shape, and perhaps, a little too plainly, if it had been to be worn where any Men were to come; but among our&s;elves it was well enough, e&s;pecially for hot Weather; the Colour was green, figur'd; and the Stuff a <HI>French</HI> Damask, very rich.</P>
<P>This Gown, or Ve&s;t, put the Girl's Tongue a run|ning again, and her Si&s;ter, as &s;he call'd her, prompted it; for as they both admir'd my Ve&s;t, and were ta|ken up much about the Beauty of the Dre&s;s, the char|ming Damask, the noble Trimming, and the like; my Girl puts in a Word to the Si&s;ter, <HI>(Captain's Wife)</HI> This is ju&s;t &s;uch a Thing as I told you, &s;ays &s;he, the Lady danc'd in: What, <HI>&s;ays the Captain's Wife,</HI> the Lady <HI>Roxana</HI> that you told me of? O! that's a charming Story, &s;ays &s;he, tell it my Lady; I cou'd not avoid &s;aying &s;o too, tho' from my Soul I wi&s;h'd her in Hea|ven for but naming it, nay, I won't &s;ay but if &s;he had been carried t'other Way, it had been much at one to me, if I cou'd but have been rid of her, and her Sto|ry too; for when &s;he came to de&s;cribe the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Dre&s;s, it was impo&s;iible but the QUAKER, who was a &s;harp pe|netrating Creature, &s;hou'd receive the Impre&s;&s;ion in a more dangerous Manner, than the Girl; only that in|deed, &s;he was not &s;o dangerous a Per&s;on; for if the had; known it all, I cou'd more freely have tru&s;ted her,; than I cou'd the Girl, by a great deal, nay, I &s;hou'd; have been perfectly ea&s;y in her.</P>
<P>However, <HI>as I have &s;aid,</HI> her Talk made me dread|fully unea'y, and the more when the Captain's Wife mention'd but the Name of <HI>Raxana;</HI> what my Fa$e; might do towards betraying me, I know not, becau&s;e; I cou'd not &s;ee my&s;elf, but my Heart beat as if it wou'd have jump'd out at my Mouth; and my Pa&s;&s;ion was &s;o great, that for want of Vent, I thought I &s;hou'd have
<PB N="299" REF="297">
bur&s;t: <HI>In a Word,</HI> I was in a kind of a &s;ilent Rage; for the Force I was under of re&s;training my Pa&s;&s;ion was &s;uch, as I never felt the like of: I had no Vent, no Body to open my&s;elf to, or to make a Complaint to for my Relief; I dur&s;t not leave the Room by any means, then &s;he wou'd have told all the Story in my Ab&s;ence, and I &s;hou'd have been perpetually unea&s;y to know what &s;he had &s;aid; &s;o that, in a Word, I was oblig'd to &s;it and hear her tell all the Story of <HI>Roxana,</HI> that is to &s;ay, of my&s;elf, and not know at the &s;ame Time, whether &s;he was in earne&s;t or in je&s;t, whether &s;he knew me or no; or, in &s;hort, whether I was to be expos'd, or not expos'd.</P>
<P>She began only in general, with telling where &s;he liv'd, what a Place &s;he had of it, how gallant a Company her Lady had always had in the Hou&s;e; how they u&s;ed to &s;it up all Night in the Hou&s;e, gaming and dancing; what a fine Lady her Mi&s;tre&s;s was, and what a va&s;t deal of Money the upper Servants got; as for her, &s;he &s;aid, her whole Bu&s;ine&s;s was in the next Hou&s;e, &s;o that &s;he got but little, except one Night, that there was twenty Guineas given to be divided among the Ser|vants, when, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he got two Guineas and a half for her Share.</P>
<P>She went on, and told them, how many Servants there was, and how they were order'd; but, &s;he &s;aid, there was one Mrs. <HI>Amy,</HI> who was over them all; and that &s;he being the Lady's Favourite, got a great deal; &s;he did not know, &s;he &s;aid, whether <HI>Amy</HI> was her Chri&s;tian Name, or her Sirname, but &s;he &s;uppos'd it was her Sirname; that they were told, &s;he got three|&s;core Pieces of Gold at one Time, being the &s;ame Night that the re&s;t of the Servants had twenty Guineas divided among them.</P>
<P>I put in at that Word, and &s;aid, 'twas a va&s;t deal to give away; why, &s;ays I, 'twas a Portion for a Ser|vant: O Madam! &s;ays &s;he, it was nothing to what &s;he got afterwards; we that were Servants, hated her heartily for it, that is to &s;ay, we wi&s;h'd it had been our Lot, in her &s;tead: <HI>Then I &s;aid again,</HI> Why, it was
<PB N="300" REF="298">
enough to get her a good Husband, and &s;ettle her in the World, if &s;he had Sen&s;e to manage it: So it might, to be &s;ure, Madam, &s;ays &s;he; for we were told, &s;he laid up above 500 <HI>l.</HI> But, I &s;uppo&s;e, Mrs. <HI>Amy</HI> was too &s;en&s;ible that her Character wou'd require a good Portion to put her off.</P>
<P>O, &s;aid I, if that was the Ca&s;e, it was another Thing.</P>
<P>Nay, &s;ays &s;he, I don't know, but they talk'd very much of a young Lord that was very great with her.</P>
<P>And pray what came of her at la&s;t? &s;aid I; for I was willing to hear a little <HI>(&s;eeing &s;he wou'd talk of it)</HI> what &s;he had to &s;ay, as well of <HI>Amy,</HI> as of my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I don't know, Madam, &s;aid &s;he, I never heard of her &s;or &s;everal Years, till the other Day, I happen'd to &s;ee her.</P>
<P>Did you indeed! &s;ays I; <HI>(and made mighty &s;trange of it)</HI> what, and in Rags, it may be, &s;aid I, that's of|ten the End of &s;uch Creatures.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t the contrary, Madam, &s;ays &s;he, She came to vi&s;it an Acquaintance of mine, little thinking, I &s;up|po&s;e, to &s;ee me, and, I a&s;&s;ure you, &s;he came in her Coach.</P>
<P>In her Coach! &s;aid I, upon my Word &s;he had made her Market then; I &s;uppo&s;e <HI>&s;he made Hay while the &s;hone;</HI> was &s;he marry'd, pray?</P>
<P>I believe &s;he had been marry'd, Madam, &s;ays &s;he, but it &s;eems &s;he had been at the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> and if &s;he was marry'd, it was there, to be &s;ure; I think &s;he &s;aid &s;he had good luck in the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>That is, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;aid I, had buried her Husband there.</P>
<P>I under&s;tand it &s;o, Madam, &s;ays &s;he, and that &s;he had got his E&s;tate.</P>
<P>Was that her good Luck? &s;aid I, it might be good to her, as to the Money indeed, but it was but the Part of a Jade, to call it good Luck.</P>
<P>Thus far our Di&s;cour&s;e of Mrs. <HI>Amy</HI> went, and no farther, for &s;he knew no more of her; but then the
<PB N="301" REF="299">
QUAKER unhappily, tho' unde&s;ignedly, put in a Que&s;|tion, which the hone&s;t good humour'd Creature wou'd have been far from doing, if &s;he had known that I car|ry'd on the Di&s;cour&s;e of <HI>Amy,</HI> on purpo&s;e to drop <HI>Rox|ana</HI> out of the Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>But I was not to be made ea&s;y too &s;oon: The QUAK|ER put in, But I think thou &s;aid'&s;t, &s;omething was be|hind of thy Mi&s;tre&s;s; what did&s;t thou call her, <HI>Roxana,</HI> was it not? Pray what became of her?</P>
<P>Ay, ay, <HI>Roxana,</HI> &s;ays the Captain's Wife; pray Si&s;ter let's hear the Story of <HI>Roxana;</HI> it will divert my Lady, I'm &s;ure.</P>
<P>That's a damn'd Lye, &s;aid I to my&s;elf; if you knew how little 'twou'd divert me, you wou'd have too much Advantage over me: Well, I &s;aw no Remedy, but the Story mu&s;t come on, &s;o I prepar'd to hear the wor&s;t of it.</P>
<P><HI>Roxana!</HI> &s;ays &s;he, I know not what to &s;ay of her; &s;he was &s;o much above us, and &s;o &s;eldom &s;een, that we cou'd know little of her but by Report, but we did &s;ometimes &s;ee her too; &s;he was a charming Wo|man indeed; and the Footmen us'd to &s;ay, that &s;he was to be &s;ent for to Court.</P>
<P>To Court, &s;aid I, why &s;he was at Court, w'an't &s;he? the <HI>Pallmall</HI> is not far from <HI>Whitehall.</HI></P>
<P>Yes, Madam, &s;ays I, but I mean another Way.</P>
<P>I under&s;tand thee, &s;ays the QUAKER; Thou mean|e&s;t, I &s;uppo&s;e, to be Mi&s;tre&s;s to the KING; yes, Madam, &s;ays &s;he.</P>
<P>I cannot help confe&s;&s;ing what a Re&s;erve of Pride &s;till was left in me; and tho' I dreaded the Sequel of the Story, yet when &s;he talk'd how hand&s;ome and how fine a Lady this <HI>Roxana</HI> was, I cou'd not help being pleas'd and tickled with it, and put in Que&s;tions two or three Times, of how hand&s;ome &s;he was? and was &s;he really &s;o fine a Woman as they talk'd of, and the like, on purpo&s;e to hear her repeat what the People's Opinion of me was, and how I had behav'd.</P>

<P>Yes, yes, Madam, &s;ays &s;he, I have &s;een her &s;everal Times in her <HI>Di&s;habille:</HI> and I can a&s;&s;ure you, &s;he was a very fine Woman; and that which was more &s;till, every body &s;aid &s;he did not paint.</P>
<P>This was &s;till agreeable to me one Way; but there was a devili&s;h Sting in the Tail of it all, and this la&s;t Article was one; wherein &s;he &s;aid, &s;he had &s;een me &s;e|veral Times in my <HI>Di&s;habille:</HI> This put me in Mind, that then &s;he mu&s;t certainly know me, and it wou'd come out at la&s;t; which was Death to me but to think of.</P>
<P>Well, but Si&s;ter, &s;ays the Captain's Wife, tell my Lady about the Ball, that's the be&s;t of all the Story; and of <HI>Roxana</HI>'s dancing in a fine Outlandi&s;h Dre&s;s.</P>
<P>That's one of the brighte&s;t Parts of her Story indeed, &s;ays the Girl; the Ca&s;e was this: We had Balls and Meetings in her Lady&s;hip's Apartments, every Weel$ almo&s;t; but one Time my Lady invited all the Nobles to come &s;uch a Time, and &s;he wou'd give them a Ball; and there was a va&s;t Crowd indeed, &s;ays &s;he.</P>
<P>I think you &s;aid, the KING was there, Si&s;ter, didn't you?</P>
<P>No, Madam, &s;ays &s;he, that was the &s;econd Time, when they &s;aid the KING had heard how finely are <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Lady danc'd, and that he was there to &s;ee her; but the KING, if His Maje&s;ty was there, came di&s;guis'd</P>
<P>That is what they call <HI>Incog.</HI> &s;ays my Friend the QUAKER; thou can'&s;t not think the KING wou'd di&s;|gui&s;e him&s;elf; yes, &s;ays the Girl, it was &s;o, he did not come in Public, with his Guards, but we all knew which was the KING well enough, that is to &s;ay, which they &s;aid was the KING.</P>
<P>Well, &s;ays the Captain's Wi&s;e, about the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Dre&s;s; pray let us hear that: Why, &s;ays &s;he, my La|dy &s;at in a fine little Drawing-Room, which open'd

<P>Here &s;he went on to de&s;cribe the Dre&s;s, as I have done already; but did it &s;o exactly, that I was &s;urpriz'd at the Manner of her telling it; there was not a Circum|&s;tance of it left out.</P>
<P>I was now under a new Perplexity; for this young Slut gave &s;o compleat an Account of every Thing in the Dre&s;s, that my Friend the QUAKER colour'd at it, and look'd two or three Times at me, to &s;ee if I did not do &s;o too; for (as &s;he told me afterwards) &s;he im|mediately perceiv'd it was the &s;ame Dre&s;s that &s;he had &s;een me have on, as I have &s;aid before: However, as &s;he &s;aw I took no Notice of it, &s;he kept her Thoughts private to her&s;elf; and I did &s;o too, as well as I cou'd.</P>
<P>I put in two or three Times, that &s;he had a good Memory, that cou'd be &s;o particular in every Part of &s;uch a Thing.</P>
<P>O Madam! &s;ays &s;he, we that were Servants, &s;tood by our&s;elves in a Corner, but &s;o as we cou'd &s;ee more than &s;ome Strangers; be&s;ides, &s;ays &s;he, it was all our Conver&s;ation for &s;everal Days in the Family, and what one did not ob&s;erve, another did: Why, &s;ays I to her, this was no <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Dre&s;s; only, I &s;uppo&s;e, your Lady was &s;ome <HI>French</HI> Comedian, that is to &s;ay, a Stage <HI>Amazon,</HI> that put on a counterfeit Dre&s;s to plea&s;e the Company, &s;uch as they us'd in the Play of <HI>Tamerlane,</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> or &s;ome &s;uch.</P>

<P>In a Word, I was &s;ick of the Di&s;cour&s;e, and en|deavour'd many Ways to put an End to it, but it was impo&s;&s;ible; for the Captain's Wife, who call'd her Si&s;ter, prompted her, and pre&s;s'd her to tell it, mo&s;t ignorantly thinking, that it wou'd be a plea&s;ant Tale to all of us.</P>

<PB N="305" REF="303">
&s;hort, her Lady kept little le&s;s than a Gaming Ordina|ry; or, <HI>as it wou'd be call'd in the Times &s;ince that,</HI> an A&s;&s;embly for Gallantry and Play.</P>
<P>All this while I was very unea&s;y, as I &s;aid before, and yet the whole Story went off again without any Di&s;covery, only that I &s;eem'd a little concern'd, that &s;he &s;hou'd liken me to this gay Lady, who&s;e Character I pretended to run down very much, even upon the Foot of her own Relation.</P>
<P>But I was not at the End of my Mortifications yet neither; for now my innocent QUAKER threw out an unhappy Expre&s;&s;ion, which put me upon the Tenters again: <HI>Says &s;he to me,</HI> this Lady's Habit, I fancy, is ju&s;t &s;uch a one as thine, by the De&s;cription of it; <HI>and then turning to the Captain's Wife,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>I fancy,</HI> my Friend has a finer <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> or <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Dre&s;s, a great deal: O! &s;ays the Girl, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to be finer; my Lady's, &s;ays &s;he, was all cover'd with Gold, and Diamonds; her Hair and Head-Dre&s;s, I forgot the Name they gave it, &s;aid &s;he, &s;hone like Stars, there was &s;o many Jewels in it.</P>
<P>I never wi&s;h'd my good Friend the QUAKER out of my Company before now; but indeed, I wou'd have given &s;ome Guineas to have been rid of her ju&s;t now; for beginning to be curious in the comparing the two Dre&s;&s;es, &s;he innocently began a De&s;cription of mine; and nothing terrify'd me &s;o much, as the Apprehen&s;ion le&s;t &s;he &s;hou'd importune me to &s;how it, which I was re|&s;olv'd I wou'd never agree to.</P>
<P>But before it came to this, &s;he pre&s;s'd my Girl to de|&s;cribe the <HI>Tyhaia,</HI> or Head-dre&s;s; which &s;he did &s;o cle|verly, that the QUAKER cou'd not help &s;aying, mine was ju&s;t &s;uch a one; and after &s;everal other Similitudes, all very vexatious to me, out comes the kind Motion to me, <HI>to let the Ladies &s;ee my Dre&s;s;</HI> and they join'd their eager De&s;ires of it even to Importunity.</P>
<P>I de&s;ir'd to be excus'd, tho' I had little to &s;ay at fir&s;t why I declin'd it; but at la&s;t, it came into my Head to &s;ay, <HI>It was pack'd up with my other Cloaths that I had lea&s;t Occa&s;ion for, in order to be &s;ent on board</HI>
<PB N="306" REF="304">
<HI>the Captain's Ship;</HI> but that if we liv'd to come to <HI>Holland</HI> together, (which, by the Way, I re&s;olv'd &s;hould never happen) then, <HI>I told them,</HI> at unpacking my Cloaths, they &s;hou'd &s;ee me dre&s;s'd in it; but they mu&s;t not ex|pect I &s;hou'd dance in it, like the Lady <HI>Roxana,</HI> in all her fine Things.</P>
<P>This carry'd it off pretty well; and getting over this, got over mo&s;t of the re&s;t, and I began to be ea&s;y again; and, in a Word, that I may di&s;mi&s;s the Story too, as &s;oon as may be, I got rid at la&s;t, of my Vi&s;itors, who I had wi&s;h'd gone two Hours &s;ooner than they intend|ed it.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they were gone, I run up to <HI>Amy,</HI> and gave Vent to my Pa&s;&s;ions, by telling her the whole Sto|ry, and letting her &s;ee what Mi&s;chiefs one fal&s;e Step of hers had like, unluckily, to have involv'd us all in, more perhaps, than we cou'd ever have liv'd to get through: <HI>Amy</HI> was &s;en&s;ible of it enough, and was ju&s;t giving her Wrath a Vent another Way, <HI>viz.</HI> by calling the poor Girl all the damn'd Jades and Fools, <HI>(and &s;ome|times wor&s;e Names)</HI> that &s;he cou'd think of; in the mid|dle of which, up comes my hone&s;t good QUAKER, and put an End to our Di&s;cour&s;e: The QUAKER came in &s;miling, (for &s;he was always &s;oberly chearful) <HI>Well, &s;ays &s;he, Thou art deliver'd at la&s;t; I come to joy thee of it; I perceiv'd thou wert tir'd grievou&s;ly of thy Vi&s;itors.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Indeed,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>&s;o I was;</HI> that fooli&s;h young Girl held us all in a <HI>Canterbury Story,</HI> I thought &s;he wou'd never have done with it: Why truly, I thought &s;he was very careful to let thee know &s;he was but a Cookmaid: Ay, &s;ays I, and at a Gaming Hou&s;e, or Gaming Or|dinary, and at t'other end of the Town too; all which <HI>(by the Way)</HI> &s;he might know, wou'd add very little to her Good Name among us Citizens.</P>
<P>I can't think, <HI>&s;ays the</HI> QUAKER, but &s;he had &s;ome other Drift in that long Di&s;cour&s;e; there's &s;omething el&s;e in her Head, &s;ays &s;he, I am &s;atisfy'd of that: <HI>Thought I,</HI> are you &s;atisfy'd of it? I am &s;ure I am the le&s;s &s;atisfy'd for that; at lea&s;t, 'tis but &s;mall Satisfaction to me, to hear you &s;ay &s;o: What can this be? &s;ays I,
<PB N="307" REF="305">
and when will my Unea&s;ine&s;&s;es have an End? <HI>But this was &s;ilent, and to my&s;elf, you may be &s;ure:</HI> But in An|&s;wer to my Friend the QUAKER, I return'd, by asking her a Que&s;tion or two about it: As what &s;he thought was in it? and why &s;he thought there was any Thing in it? For, &s;ays I, &s;he can have nothing in it relating to me.</P>
<P>Nay, &s;ays the kind QUAKER, if &s;he had any View towards thee, that's no Bu&s;ine&s;s of mine; and I &s;hou'd be far from de&s;iring thee to inform me.</P>
<P>This alarm'd me again; not that I feared tru&s;ting the good humour'd Creature with it, if there had been any Thing of ju&s;t Su&s;picion in her; but this Affair was a Se|cret I car'd not to communicate to any body: However, I &s;ay, this alarm'd me a little; for as I had conceal'd every Thing from her, I was willing to do &s;o &s;till; but as &s;he cou'd not but gather up abundance of Things from the Girl's Di&s;cour&s;e, which look'd towards me, &s;o &s;he was too penetrating to be put off with &s;uch An&s;wers, as might &s;top another's Mouth: Only there was this double Felicity in it; <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> That &s;he was not inqui&s;itive to know, or find any Thing out; and not dangerous, if &s;he had known the whole Story: But, as I &s;ay, &s;he cou'd not but gather up &s;everal Circum&s;tances from the Girl's Di&s;cour&s;e; as particularly, the Name of <HI>Amy;</HI> and the &s;everal De&s;criptions of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Dre&s;s, which my Friend the QUAKER had &s;een, and taken &s;o much Notice of, <HI>as I have &s;aid before.</HI></P>
<P>As for that, I might have turn'd it off by je&s;ting with <HI>Amy,</HI> and asking her who &s;he liv'd with before &s;he came to live with me? But that would not do; for we had un|happily anticipated that Way of talking, by having of|ten talk'd how long <HI>Amy</HI> had liv'd with me; and which was &s;till wor&s;e, by having own'd formerly, that I had had Lodgings in the <HI>Pallmall;</HI> &s;o that all the&s;e Things corre&s;ponded too well. There was only one Thing that help'd me out with the QUAKER, and that was the Girl's having reported how rich Mrs. <HI>Amy</HI> was grown, and that &s;he kept her Coach; now as there might be many more Mrs. <HI>Amy</HI>'s be&s;ides mine, &s;o it was not like|ly
<PB N="308" REF="306">
to be my <HI>Amy,</HI> becau&s;e &s;he was far from &s;uch a Figure as keeping her Coach; and this carried it off from the Su&s;picions, which the good friendly QUAKER might have in her Head.</P>
<P>But as to what &s;he imagined the Girl had in her Head, there lay more real Difficulty in that Part, a great deal; and I was alarm'd at it very much; for my Friend the QUAKER told me, She ob&s;erved that the Girl was in a great Pa&s;&s;ion when &s;he talk'd of the Ha|bit, and more when I had been importun'd to &s;hew her mine, but declin'd it. <HI>She &s;aid,</HI> She &s;everal Times per|ceived her to be in Di&s;order, and to re&s;train her&s;elf with great Difficulty; and once or twice &s;he muttered to her|&s;elf, that <HI>&s;he had found it out;</HI> or, that <HI>&s;he would find it out,</HI> &s;he could not tell whether; and that &s;he often &s;aw Tears in her Eyes; that when I &s;aid my Suit of <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Cloaths was put up, but that &s;he &s;hould &s;ee it when we arrived in <HI>Holland,</HI> &s;he heard her &s;ay &s;oftly, <HI>She would go over on Purpo&s;e then.</HI></P>
<P>After &s;he had ended her Ob&s;ervations, <HI>I added,</HI> I ob|&s;erved too, that the Girl talk'd and look'd oddly, and that &s;he was very inqui&s;itive, but I could not imagine what it was &s;he aim'd at: Aim'd at, <HI>&s;ays the</HI> QUAKER, 'tis plain to me what &s;he aims at; &s;he believes that thou art the &s;ame Lady <HI>Roxana</HI> that danc'd in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Ve&s;t, but &s;he is not certain. Does &s;he believe &s;o! <HI>&s;ays I;</HI> If I had thought that, I would have put her out of her Pain. Believe &s;o! <HI>&s;ays the</HI> QUAKER, Yes; and I be|gan to believe &s;o too, and &s;hould have believed &s;o &s;till, if thou had'&s;t not &s;atisfied me to the contrary, by <HI>thy</HI> taking no Notice of it, and by what thou ha&s;t &s;aid &s;ince. Should you have believ'd &s;o? <HI>&s;aid I, warmly,</HI> I am ve|ry &s;orry for that; why, would you have taken me for an <HI>Actre&s;s,</HI> or a <HI>French Stage-player?</HI> No, <HI>&s;ays the good kind Creature, thou</HI> carrie&s;t it too far; as &s;oon as thou made&s;t <HI>thy</HI> Reflections upon her, I knew it could not be; but who could think any other, when &s;he de&s;crib'd the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Dre&s;s which <HI>thou</HI> ha&s;t here, with the Head-tire and Jewels; and when &s;he nam'd thy Maid <HI>Amy</HI> too, and &s;everal other Circum&s;tances concurring? I &s;hould
<PB N="309" REF="307">
certainly have behaved it, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> if <HI>thou</HI> had&s;t not contradicted it; but as &s;oon as I heard <HI>thee</HI> &s;peak, I con|cluded it was otherwi&s;e. That was very kind, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> and I am obliged to you for doing me &s;o much Ju&s;tice; 'tis more, it &s;eems, than that young talking Creature does. Nay, <HI>&s;ays the</HI> QUAKER, indeed &s;he does not do <HI>thee</HI> Ju&s;tice; for &s;he as certainly believes it &s;till, as ever &s;he did. Does &s;he, <HI>&s;aid I?</HI> Ay, <HI>&s;ays the</HI> QUAKER, and I warrant <HI>thee</HI> &s;he'll make <HI>thee</HI> another $Word$ about it. Will &s;he, <HI>&s;ays I?</HI> then I believe I &s;hall downright affront her. No, <HI>thou</HI> &s;halt not affront her, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> (full of her good Humour and Temper) I'll take that Part off thy Hands, for I'll affront her for thee, and not let her &s;ee <HI>thee.</HI> I thought that was a very kind Offer, but was at a Lo&s;s how &s;he would be able to do it; and the Thought of &s;eeing her again half di&s;tracted me, not knowing what Temper &s;he would come in, much le&s;s what Manner to receive her in; but my fa&s;t Friend and con&s;tant Comforter, the QUAKER, <HI>&s;aid,</HI> &s;he perceived the Girl was impertinent, and that I had no Inclination to conver&s;e with her; and &s;he was re&s;olved I &s;hould not be troubled with her. But I &s;hall have Occa&s;ion to &s;ay more of this pre&s;ently; for this Girl went further yet than I thought &s;he had.</P>
<P>It was now Time, <HI>as I &s;aid before,</HI> to take Mea&s;ures with my Husband, in Order to put off my Voyage; &s;o I &s;ell into Talk with him one Morning as he was dre&s;|&s;ing, and while I was in Bed; I pretended I was very ill; and as I had but too ea&s;y a Way to impo&s;e upon him, becau&s;e he &s;o ab&s;olutely believed every Thing I &s;aid; &s;o I manag'd my Di&s;cour&s;e &s;o, as that he &s;hould under&s;tand by it, I was a breeding, tho' I did not tell him &s;o.</P>
<P>However, I brought it about &s;o hand&s;omely, that be|fore he went out of the Room, he came and &s;at down by my Bed-&s;ide, and began to talk very &s;eriou&s;ly to me upon the Subject of my being &s;o every Day ill; and that, as he hop'd I was with Child, he would have me con&s;ider well of it, whether I had not be&s;t alter my Thoughts of the Voyage to <HI>Holland;</HI> for that being Sea-&s;ick, and
<PB N="310" REF="308">
which was wor&s;e, if a Storm &s;hould happen, might be very dangerous to me. And after &s;aying Abundance of the kinde&s;t Things that the kinde&s;t of Husbands in the World could &s;ay, he concluded, That it was his Re|que&s;t to me, that I would not think any more of going, till after all &s;hould be over; but that I would, <HI>on the con|trary,</HI> prepare to ly in where I was, and where I knew as well as he, I could be very well provided, and very well a&s;&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>This was ju&s;t what I wanted; for I had, <HI>as you have heard,</HI> a thou&s;and good Rea&s;ons why I &s;hould put off the Voyage, <HI>e&s;pecially</HI> with that Creature in Company, but I had a Mind the putting it off &s;hould be at his Mo|tion, not my own; and he came into it of him&s;elf, ju&s;t as I would have had it. This gave me an Opportuni|ty to hang back a little, and to &s;eem as if I was unwill|ing: <HI>I told him,</HI> I could not abide to put him to Diffi|culties and Perplexities in his Bu&s;ine&s;s; that now he had hir'd the Great-Cabbin in the Ship, <HI>and perhaps,</HI> paid &s;ome of the Money, and, <HI>it may be,</HI> taken Freight for Goods; and to make him break it all off again, would be a needle&s;s Charge to him, <HI>or perhaps,</HI> a Damage to the Captain.</P>
<P>As to that, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> it was not to be nam'd, and he would not allow it to be any Con&s;ideration at all; that he could ea&s;ily pacify the Captain of the Ship, by tel|ling him the Rea&s;on of it; and that if he did make him &s;ome Satisfaction for the Di&s;appointment, it &s;hould not be much.</P>
<P>But my Dear, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> you ha'n't heard me &s;ay I am with Child, neither can I &s;ay &s;o; and if it &s;hould not be &s;o at la&s;t, then I &s;hall have made a &s;ine Piece of Work of it indeed; be&s;ides, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> the two Ladies, the Cap|tain's Wife, and her Si&s;ter, they depend upon our going over, and have made great Preparations, and all in Com|pliment to me; what mu&s;t I &s;ay to them?</P>
<P>Well, my Dear, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> if you &s;hould not be with Child, tho' I hope you are, yet there is no Harm done; the &s;taying three or four Months longer in <HI>England</HI> will be no Damage to me, and we can go when we plea&s;e,
<PB N="311" REF="309">
when we are &s;ure you are not with Child, or when it ap|pearing that you are with Child, you &s;hall be down and up again; and as for the Captain's Wife and Si&s;ter, leave that Part to me, I'll an&s;wer for it, there &s;hall be no Quarrel rai&s;ed upon that Subject, I'll make your Ex|cu&s;e to them by the Captain him&s;elf; &s;o all will be well enough there, I warrant you.</P>
<P>This was as much as I could de&s;ire; and thus it re&s;ted for a while. I had indeed &s;ome anxious Thoughts about this impertinent Girl, but believed that putting off the Voyage would have put an End to it all; &s;o I began to be pretty ea&s;y; but I found my&s;elf mi&s;taken, for I was brought to the Point of De&s;truction by her again, and that in the mo&s;t unaccountable Manner imaginable.</P>
<P>My Husband, as he and I had agreed, meeting the Captain of the Ship, took the Freedom to tell him, That he was afraid he mu&s;t di&s;appoint him, for that &s;omething had fallen out, which had obliged him to al|ter his Mea&s;ures, and that his Family could not be ready to go Time enough for him.</P>
<P>I know the Occa&s;ion, Sir, <HI>&s;ays the Captain;</HI> I hear your Lady has got a Daughter more than &s;he expected; I give you Joy of it. What do you mean by that? <HI>&s;ays my Spou&s;e.</HI> Nay, nothing, <HI>&s;ays the Captain,</HI> but what I hear the Women tattle over the Tea-table. I know no|thing, but that you don't go the Voyage upon it, which I am &s;orry for; but you know your own Affairs, <HI>added the Captain,</HI> that is no Bu&s;ine&s;s mine.</P>
<P>Well but, <HI>&s;ays my Husband,</HI> I mu&s;t make you &s;ome Satisfaction for the Di&s;appointment, and &s;o he pulls out his Money. No, no, <HI>&s;ays the Captain,</HI> and &s;o they fell to &s;training their Compliments one upon another; but, <HI>in &s;hort,</HI> my Spou&s;e gave him three or four Guineas, and made him take it; and &s;o the fir&s;t Di&s;cour&s;e went off again, and they had no more of it.</P>
<P>But it did not go off &s;o ea&s;ily with me; for now, <HI>in a Word,</HI> the Clouds began to thicken about me, and I had Alarms on every Side. My Husband told me what the Captain had &s;aid; but very happily took it, that the Captain had brought a Talc by Halves, and
<PB N="312" REF="310">
having heard it one Way, had told it another; and that neither could he under&s;tand the Captain, neither did the Captain under&s;tand him&s;elf; &s;o he contented him&s;elf to tell me, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> Word for Word, as the Captain de|livered it.</P>
<P>How I kept my Husband from di&s;covering my Di&s;order, <HI>you &s;hall hear pre&s;ently;</HI> but let it &s;uffice to &s;ay ju&s;t now, that if my Husband did not under&s;tand the Captain, nor the Captain under&s;tand him&s;elf, yet I under&s;tood them both very well; and to tell the Truth it was a wor&s;e Shock than ever I had had yet. Invention &s;upplied me indeed with a &s;udden Motion to avoid &s;hewing my Sur|prize; for as my Spou&s;e and I was &s;itting by a little Table near the Fire, I reach'd out my Hand, as if I had in|tended to take a Spoon which lay on the other Side, and threw one of the Candles off of the Table; and then &s;natching it up, &s;tarted up upon my Feet, and &s;toop'd to the Lap of my Gown, and took it in my Hand; O! <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> my Gown's &s;poil'd, the Candle has grea&s;ed it prodigiou&s;ly. This furni&s;hed me with an Excu&s;e to my Spou&s;e, to break off the Di&s;cour&s;e for the pre&s;ent, and call <HI>Amy</HI> down; and <HI>Amy</HI> not coming pre&s;ently, <HI>I &s;aid to him,</HI> My Dear, I mu&s;t run up Stairs, and put it off, and let <HI>Amy</HI> clean it a little; &s;o my Husband ro&s;e up too, and went into a Clo&s;et, where he kept his Papers and Books, and fetch'd a Book out, and &s;at down by him|&s;elf to read.</P>
<P>Glad I was that I had got away; and up I run to <HI>A|my,</HI> who, as it happened, was alone; O <HI>Amy! &s;ays I,</HI> we are all utterly undone; and with that, I bur&s;t out a crying, and could not &s;peak a Word for a great while.</P>
<P>I cannot help &s;aying, that &s;ome very good Reflections offer'd them&s;elves upon this Head; it pre&s;ently occurr'd, What a glorious Te&s;timony it is to the Ju&s;tice of Provi|dence, and to the Concern Providence has in guiding all the Affairs of Men, <HI>(even the lea&s;t, as well as the greate&s;t)</HI> that the mo&s;t &s;ecret Crimes are, by the mo&s;t unfore&s;een Accidents, brought to light, and di&s;cover'd.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="311">
Another Reflection was, How ju&s;t it is, that Sin and Shame follow one another &s;o con&s;tantly at the Heels, that they are not like Attendants only, but like Cau&s;e and Con&s;equence, nece&s;&s;arily connected one with another; that the Crime going before, the Scandal is certain to follow; and that 'tis not in the Power of human Na|ture to conceal the fir&s;t, or avoid the la&s;t.</P>
<P>What &s;hall I do? <HI>Amy,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>as &s;oon as I could &s;peak,</HI> and what will become of me? And then I cried again &s;o vehemently that I could &s;ay no more a great while. <HI>Amy</HI> was frighted almo&s;t out of her Wits, but knew no|thing what the Matter was; but &s;he begg'd to know, and per&s;waded me to compo&s;e my&s;elf, and not cry &s;o. Why, Madam, if my Ma&s;ter &s;hould come up now, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> he will &s;ee what a Di&s;order you are in; he will know you have been crying, and then he will want to knows the Cau&s;e of it; with that I broke out again, O! he knows it already, <HI>Amy,</HI> &s;ays I, he knows all! 'tis all di&s;covered! and we are undone! <HI>Amy</HI> was Thunder|&s;truck now indeed. Nay, <HI>&s;ays</HI> Amy, if that be true, we are undone indeed; but that can never be; that's impo&s;&s;ible, I am &s;ure.</P>
<P>No, no, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> 'tis far from impo&s;&s;ible, for I te'l you 'tis &s;o; and by this Time being a little recovered, I told her what Di&s;cour&s;e my Husband and the Captain had had together, and what the Captain had &s;aid. This put <HI>Amy</HI> into &s;uch a Hurry, that &s;he cry'd, &s;he rav'd, &s;he &s;wore and curs'd like a mad Thing; then &s;he upbraided me, that I would not let her kill the Girl when &s;he would have done it, and that it was all my own doing, <HI>and the like.</HI> Well however, I was not for killing the Girl yet, I could not bear the Thoughts of that nei|ther.</P>
<P>We &s;pent half an Hour in the&s;e Extravagancies, and brought nothing out of them neither; for indeed we could do nothing or &s;ay nothing that was to the Pur|po&s;e; for if any Thing was to come cut-of-the-Way, there was no hindering it, nor Help for it; &s;o after thus giving Vent to my&s;elf by crying, I began to reflect how I had left my Spou&s;e below, and what I had pretended
<PB N="314" REF="312">
to come up for; &s;o I changed my Gown that I pre|tended the Candle fell upon, and put on another, and went down.</P>
<P>When I had been down a good while, and found my Spou&s;e did not fall into the Story again, as I expected, I took Heart and called for it. My Dear, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> the Fall of the Candle put you out of your Hi&s;tory, won't you go on with it? What Hi&s;tory? <HI>&s;ays he.</HI> Why, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> about the Captain. O! <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I had done with it, I know no more than the Captain told a broken Piece of News that he had heard by Halves, and told more by Halves than he heard it; <HI>namely,</HI> of your being with Child, and that you could not go the Voyage.</P>
<P>I perceiv'd my Husband enter'd not into the Thing at all, but took it for a Story, which being told two or three Times over, was puzzl'd, and come to nothing; and that all that was meant by it was, what he knew, or thought he knew already, <HI>viz.</HI> that I was with Child, which he wi&s;h'd might be true.</P>
<P>His Ignorance was a Cordial to my Soul; and I curs'd them in my Thoughts, that &s;hould ever undeceive him; and as I &s;aw him willing to have the Story end there, as not worth being farther mentioned, I clos'd it too; <HI>and &s;aid,</HI> I &s;uppos'd the Captain had it from his Wife; &s;he might have found &s;omebody el&s;e to make her Remarks upon, and &s;o it pa&s;s'd off with my Husband well enough, and I was &s;till &s;afe there, where I thought my&s;elf in mo&s;t Danger; but I had two Unea&s;ine&s;&s;es &s;till; the fir&s;t was, le&s;t the Captain and my Spou&s;e &s;hould meet again, and enter into farther Di&s;cour&s;e about it; and the &s;econd was, le&s;t the bu&s;y impertinent Girl &s;hould come again, and when &s;he came how to prevent her &s;ee|ing <HI>Amy,</HI> which was an Article as material as any of the re&s;t; for &s;eeing <HI>Amy</HI> would have been as fatal to me as her knowing all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t of the&s;e, I knew the Captain could not &s;tay in Town above a Week; but that his Ship being already full of Goods, and fallen down the River, he mu&s;t &s;oon follow; &s;o I contriv'd to carry my Husband
<PB N="315" REF="313">
&s;omewhere out of Town for a few Days, that they might be &s;ure not to meet.</P>
<P>My greate&s;t Concern was, where we &s;hould go; at la&s;t I fix'd upon <HI>North-Hall;</HI> not, <HI>I &s;aid,</HI> that I would drink the Waters, but that I thought the Air was good, and might be for my Advantage. He, who did every Thing upon the Foundation of obliging me, readily came into it, and the Coach was appointed to be ready the next Morning; but as we were &s;ettling Matters, he put in an ugly Word that thwarted all my De&s;ign; and that was, That he had rather I would &s;tay till After|noon, for that he &s;hould &s;peak to the Captain next Morn|ing, if he could, to give him &s;ome Letters; which he could do, and be back again about twelve o' Clock.</P>
<P><HI>I &s;aid, Ay, by all Means;</HI> but it was a Cheat on him, and my Voice and my Heart differ'd; for I re&s;olved, <HI>if po&s;&s;ible,</HI> he &s;hould not come near the Captain, nor &s;ee him, whatever came of it.</P>
<P>In the Evening therefore, a little before we went to Bed, I pretended to have altered my Mind, and that I would not go to <HI>North-Hall,</HI> but I had a Mind to go an|other Way, <HI>but I told him,</HI> I was afraid his Bu&s;ine&s;s would not permit him; he wanted to know where it was? <HI>I told him, &s;miling,</HI> I would not tell him, le&s;t it &s;hould oblige him to hinder his Bu&s;ine&s;s. <HI>He an&s;wered,</HI> with the &s;ame Temper, <HI>but with infinitely more Sinceri|ty,</HI> That he had no Bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;o much Con&s;equence, as to hinder him going with me any where that I had a Mind to go: <HI>Yes,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>you want to &s;peak with the Captain before he goes away.</HI> Why that's true, <HI>&s;ays he, &s;o I do,</HI> and paus'd a while; and <HI>then added,</HI> But I'll write a Note to a Man that does Bu&s;ine&s;s for me, to go to him; 'tis only to get &s;ome Bills of Loading &s;ign'd, and he can do it. When I &s;aw I had gain'd my Point, I &s;eem'd to hang back a little; my Dear, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> don't hinder an Hour's Bu&s;ine&s;s for me; I can put it off for a Week or two, rather than you &s;hall do your&s;elf any Pre|judice. No, no, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> you &s;hall not put it off an Hour for me, for I can do my Bu&s;ine&s;s by Proxy with any Body, <HI>but my</HI> WIFE; <HI>and then he took me in his</HI>

<HI>Arms and ki&s;s'd me.</HI> How did my Blood flu&s;h up into my Face! when I reflected how &s;incerely, how affectionate|ly this good-humour'd Gentleman embrac'd the mo&s;t cur&s;ed Piece of Hypocri&s;y that ever came into the Arms of an hone&s;t Man? His was all Tenderne&s;s, all Kind|ne&s;s, and the utmo&s;t Sincerity; mine all Grimace and Deceit, a Piece of meer Menage, and fram'd Conduct to conceal a pa&s;s'd Life of Wickedne&s;s, and prevent his di&s;covering that he had in his Arms a She-Devil, who&s;e whole Conver&s;ation for twenty five Years had been black as Hell, a Complication of Crime; and for which, had he been let into it, he mu&s;t have abhor'd me, and the very Mention of my Name. But there was no Help for me in it; all I had to &s;atisfy my&s;elf was, that it was my Bu&s;ine&s;s to be what I was, and conceal what I had been; that all the Satisfaction I could make him, was to live virtuou&s;ly for the Time to come, not being able to retrieve what had been in Time pa&s;t; and this I re|&s;olv'd upon, tho' had the great Temptation offered, as it did afterwards, I had Rea&s;on to que&s;tion my Stabili|ty. <HI>But of that hereafter.</HI></P>
<P>After my Husband had kindly thus given up his Mea|&s;ures to mine, we re&s;olved to &s;et out in the Morning early. <HI>I told him,</HI> that my Project, <HI>if he lik'd it,</HI> was, to go to <HI>Tunbridge;</HI> and he, being entirely pa&s;&s;ive in the Thing, agreed to it with the greate&s;t Willingne&s;s; <HI>but &s;aid,</HI> If I had not nam'd <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> he would have nam'd <HI>Newmarket; (there being a great Court there, and Abundance of fine Things to be &s;een)</HI> I offer'd him another Piece of Hypocri&s;y here, for I pretended to be willing to go thither, <HI>as the Place of his Choice,</HI> but in|deed I would not have gone for a thou&s;and Pounds; for the COURT being there at that Time, I dur&s;t not run the Hazard of being known at a Place where there were &s;o many Eyes that had &s;een me before. So that, <HI>after &s;ome Time,</HI> I told my Husband, that I thought <HI>New|market</HI> was &s;o full of People at that Time, that we &s;hould get no Accommodation; that &s;eeing the COURT and the Crowd was no Entertainment to me, unle&s;s as it might be &s;o to him, that if he thought fit, we would
<PB N="317" REF="315">
rather put it off to another Time; and that if, when he went to <HI>Holland,</HI> we &s;hould go by <HI>Harwich,</HI> we might take a Round by <HI>Newmarket</HI> and <HI>Bury,</HI> and &s;o come to <HI>Ip&s;wich,</HI> and go from thence to the Sea &s;ide. He was ea&s;ily put off from this, as he was from any Thing el&s;e, that I did not approve; and &s;o with all imagina|ble Facility he appointed to be ready early in the Morn|ing to go with me for <HI>Tunbridge.</HI></P>
<P>I had a double De&s;ign in this, <HI>viz. Fir&s;t,</HI> To get a|way my Spou&s;e from &s;eeing the Captain any more; and <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> To be out of the Way my&s;elf, in Ca&s;e this impertinent Girl, who was now my Plague, &s;hould offer to come again, as my Friend the QUAKER be|lieved &s;he would, and as indeed happened within two or three Days afterwards.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;ecur'd my going away the next Day, I had nothing to do but to furni&s;h my faithful Agent, the QUAKER, with &s;ome In&s;tructions what to &s;ay to this Tormentor, (for &s;uch &s;he prov'd afterwards) and how to manage her, if &s;he made any more Vi&s;its than ordinary.</P>
<P>I had a great Mind to leave. <HI>Amy</HI> behind too, as an A&s;&s;i&s;tant, becau&s;e &s;he under&s;tood &s;o perfectly well, what to advi&s;e upon any Emergence; and <HI>Amy</HI> importun'd me to do &s;o; but I know not what &s;ecret Impul&s;e pre|vail'd over my. Thoughts again&s;t it, I could not do it, for fear the wicked Jade &s;hould make her away, which my very Soul abhor'd the Thoughts of; which how|ever, <HI>Amy</HI> found Means to bring to pa&s;s afterwards, as I may in Time relate more particularly.</P>
<P>It is true, I wanted as much to be delivered from her as ever a &s;ick Man did from a Third-day Ague; and had &s;he dropp'd into the Grave by any fair Way, <HI>as I may call it,</HI> I mean, had &s;he died of any ordinary Di&s;|temper, I &s;hould have &s;hed but very &s;ew Tears for her. But I was not arrived to &s;uch a Pitch of ob&s;tinate Wick|edne&s;s, as to commit Murther, e&s;pecially &s;uch as to murder my own Child, or &s;o much as to harbour a Thought &s;o barbarous in my Mind. But, <HI>as I &s;aid,</HI>
<PB N="318" REF="316">
<HI>Amy</HI> effected all afterwards, without my Knowledge, for which I gave her my hearty Cur&s;e, tho' I could do little more; for to have fallen upon <HI>Amy,</HI> had been to have murdered my&s;elf. But this Tragedy requires a longer Story than I have Room for here. <HI>I return to my Journey.</HI></P>
<P>My dear Friend the QUAKER was kind, and yet ho|ne&s;t, and would do any Thing that was ju&s;t and up|right, to &s;erve me, but nothing wicked or di&s;honour|able; that &s;he might be able to &s;ay boldly to the Crea|ture, if &s;he came, &s;he did not know where I was gone, &s;he de&s;ired I would not let her know; and to make her Ignorance the more ab&s;olutely &s;afe to her&s;elf, and like|wi&s;e to me, I allowed her to &s;ay, that &s;he heard us talk of going to <HI>Newmarket,</HI> &amp;c. She lik'd that Part, and I left all the re&s;t to her to act as &s;he thought &s;it, only charg'd her, that if the Girl entered into the Story of the <HI>Pallmall,</HI> &s;he &s;hould not entertain much Talk about it; but let her under&s;tand, that we all thought &s;he &s;poke of it a little too particularly; and that the Lady <HI>(mean|ing me)</HI> took it a little ill, to be &s;o likened to a public Mi&s;tre&s;s, or a Stage-player, <HI>and the like;</HI> and &s;o to bring her, if po&s;&s;ible, to &s;ay no more of it. How|ever, tho' I did not tell my Friend the QUAKER how to write to me, or where I was, yet I left a &s;ealed Pa|per with her Maid to give her, in which I gave her a Direction how to write to <HI>Amy,</HI> and &s;o in Effect to my|&s;elf.</P>
<P>It was but a few Days after I was gone, but the im|patient Girl came to my Lodgings on Pretence to &s;ee how I did, and to hear if I intended to go the Voyage, <HI>and the like.</HI> My tru&s;ty Agent was at Home, and re|ceived her coldly at the Door; <HI>but told her,</HI> That the Lady, <HI>which &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he meant,</HI> was <HI>gone from her Hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>This was a full Stop to all &s;he could &s;ay for a good while; but as &s;he &s;tood mu&s;ing &s;ome Time at the Door, con&s;idering what to begin a Talk upon, &s;he perceived my Friend the QUAKER look'd a little unea&s;y, as if
<PB N="319" REF="317">
&s;he wanted to go in and &s;hut the Door, which &s;tung her to the Quick; and the wary QUAKER had not &s;o much as asked her to come in; for &s;eeing her alone &s;he ex|pected &s;he would be very impertinent; and concluded, that I did not care how coldly &s;he received her.</P>
<P>But &s;he was not to be put off &s;o. <HI>She &s;aid,</HI> if the Lady&mdash;was not to be &s;poke with, &s;he de&s;ired to &s;peak two or three Words with her, <HI>meaning my Friend the</HI> QUAKER. Upon that the QUAKER civilly, but coldly, a&s;k'd her to walk in, which was what &s;he wanted. <HI>No e,</HI> She did not carry her into her be&s;t Parlour, <HI>as formerly,</HI> but into a little outer Room, where the Ser|vants u&s;ually waited.</P>
<P>By the fir&s;t of her Di&s;cour&s;e &s;he did not &s;tick to in&s;i|nuate, as if &s;he believed I was in the Hou&s;e, but was unwilling to be &s;een; and pre&s;s'd earne&s;tly that &s;he might &s;peak but two Words with me; to which &s;he added earne&s;t Entreaties, and at la&s;t Tears.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry, <HI>&s;ays my good Crcature the</HI> QUAKER, <HI>thou</HI> ha&s;t &s;o ill an Opinion of me, as to think I would tell <HI>thee</HI> an Untruth, <HI>and &s;ay,</HI> that the Lady&mdash;was gone from my Hou&s;e, if &s;he was not?

<P><HI>She &s;aid little to that,</HI> but &s;aid, it was Bu&s;ine&s;s of the utmo&s;t Importance, that &s;he de&s;ired to &s;peak with me about; <HI>and then cry'd again very much.</HI></P>

<P>Why truly, <HI>&s;ays the</HI> QUAKER, <HI>with a very happy Turn of Wit,</HI> I do not like to be examin'd; but le&s;t <HI>thou</HI> &s;hould'&s;t take up any Mi&s;takes, by Rea&s;on of my Back|wardne&s;s to &s;peak, I will an&s;wer <HI>thee</HI> for once, That what her Woman's Name is, I know not; but they call her <HI>Cherry.</HI></P>
<Q>N. B. <HI>My Husband gave her that Name in Je&s;t, on our Wedding day, and we had called her by it ever after; &s;o that &s;he &s;poke literally true at that Time.</HI></Q>
<P><HI>The Girl reply'd very mode&s;tly,</HI> That &s;he was &s;orry if &s;he gave her any Offence in asking; that &s;he did not de&s;ign to be rude to her, or pretend to examine her; but that &s;he was in &s;uch an Agony at this Di&s;a&s;ter, that &s;he knew not what &s;he did or &s;aid; and that &s;he &s;hould be very &s;orry to di&s;oblige her, but begg'd of her again, as &s;he was a Chri&s;tian and a Woman, and had been a Mother of Children, that &s;he would take Pity on her, and, <HI>if po&s;&s;ible,</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;t her, &s;o that &s;he might but come to me, and &s;peak a few Words to me.</P>
<P>The tender-hearted QUAKER told me, the Girl &s;poke this with &s;uch moving Eloquence, that it forc'd Tears from her; but &s;he was oblig'd to &s;ay, That &s;he neither knew where I was gone, or how to write to me; but that if &s;he did ever &s;ee me again, &s;he would not fail to give me an Account of all we had &s;aid to her, or that &s;he &s;hould yet think fit to &s;ay; and to take my An&s;wer to it, if I thought fit to give any.</P>
<P>Then the QUAKER took the Freedom to ask a few Particulars about this wonderful Story, <HI>as &s;he called it;</HI> at which, the Girl beginning at the fir&s;t Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of my

<P>My good Friend the QUAKER, tho' terribly &s;hock'd at the Story, and not well knowing what to &s;ay, yet was too much my Friend to &s;eem convinc'd in a Thing, which, if it was true, &s;he could &s;ee plainly I had a Mind &s;hould not be known; &s;o &s;he turn'd her Di&s;cour&s;e to ar|gue the Girl out of it: She in&s;i&s;ted upon the &s;lender E|vidence &s;he had of the Fact it&s;elf, and the Rudene&s;s of claiming &s;o near a Relation of one &s;o much above her, and of who&s;e Concern in it &s;he had no Knowledge, <HI>at lea&s;t,</HI> no &s;ufficient Proof; that as the Lady at her Hou&s;e was a Per&s;on above any Di&s;gui&s;es, &s;o &s;he could not be|lieve that &s;he would deny her being her Daughter, if &s;he was really her Mother; that &s;he was able &s;uffici|ently to have provided for her, if &s;he had not a Mind to have her known; and therefore, &s;eeing &s;he had heard all &s;he had &s;aid of the Lady <HI>Roxana,</HI> and was &s;o far from owning her&s;elf to be the Per&s;on, that &s;he had cen|&s;ur'd that &s;ham Lady as a Cheat, and Common Woman; and that 'twas certain &s;he could never be brought to own a Name and Character &s;he had &s;o ju&s;tly expos'd.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide, &s;he told her, that her Lodger, meaning me, was not a Sham Lady, but the real Wife of a Knight Baronet; and that &s;he knew her to be hone&s;tly &s;uch, and far above &s;uch a Per&s;on as &s;he had de&s;crib'd: <HI>She then added,</HI> that &s;he had another Rea&s;on why it was not very po&s;&s;ible to be true, <HI>and that is, &s;ays &s;he,</HI> Thy Age is in the Way; for thou acknowledge&s;t, that thou art four and twenty Years old; and that thou wa&s;t the

<P>But this was all nothing: She cou'd be &s;atisfy'd with nothing but &s;eeing me; but the QUAKER defended her|&s;elf very well, and in&s;i&s;ted on it, that &s;he cou'd not give her any Account of me; and finding her &s;till importunate, &s;he affected at la&s;t, being a little di&s;gu&s;ted that &s;he &s;hou'd not believe her, and added, That indeed, if &s;he had known where I was gone, &s;he wou'd not have given any one an Account of it, unle&s;s I had given her Orders to do &s;o; but &s;eeing &s;he has not acquainted me, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> where &s;he is gone, 'tis an Intimation to me, &s;he was not de&s;irous it &s;hou'd be publickly known; and with this &s;he ro&s;e up, which was as plain a de&s;iring her to ri&s;e up too, and be gone, as cou'd be expre&s;s'd, ex|cept the downright &s;howing her the Door.</P>
<P>Well, the Girl rejected all this, <HI>and told her,</HI> She cou'd not indeed expect that &s;he (the QUAKER) &s;hou'd be affected with the Story &s;he had told her, however mo|ving; or that &s;he &s;hou'd take any Pity on her: That it was her Misfortune, that when &s;he was at the Hou&s;e before, and in the Room with me, &s;he did not beg to &s;peak a Word with me in private, or throw her&s;elf upon the Floor at my Feet, and claim what the Affection of a Mother wou'd have done for her; but &s;ince &s;he had &s;lipp'd her Opportunity, &s;he wou'd wait for another; that &s;he found by her <HI>the Quaker</HI>'s) Talk, that &s;he had not quite left her Lodgings, but was gone into the Coun|try, <HI>&s;he &s;uppos'd,</HI> for the Air; and &s;he was re&s;olv'd &s;he wou'd take &s;o much <HI>Knight-Errantry</HI> upon her, that &s;he
<PB N="324" REF="322">
wou'd vi&s;it all the Airing-Places in the Nation, and even all the Kingdom over, ay, and <HI>Holland</HI> too, but &s;he wou'd find me; for &s;he was &s;atisfy'd the cou'd &s;o con|vince me that &s;he was my own Child, that I wou'd not deny it; and &s;he was &s;ure I was &s;o tender and compa&s;|&s;ionate, I wou'd not let her peri&s;h after I was convinc'd that &s;he was my own Fle&s;h and Blood; and in &s;aying &s;he wou'd vi&s;it all the Airing-Places in <HI>England,</HI> &s;he re|ckon'd them all up by Name, and began with <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> the very Place I was gone to; then reckoning up <HI>Ep&s;om, North-hall, Barnet, Newmarket, Bury,</HI> and at la&s;t, the <HI>Bath:</HI> and with this &s;he took her Leave.</P>
<P>My faithful Agent the QUAKER, fail'd not to write to me immediately; but as &s;he was a cunning, as well as an hone&s;t Woman, it pre&s;ently occurr'd to her, that this was a Story, which, whether true or fal&s;e, was not very fit to come to my Husband's Knowledge; that as &s;he did not know what I might have been, or might have been cali'd in former Times, and how far there might have been &s;omething or nothing in it, &s;o &s;he thought if it was a Secret, I ought to have the telling it my&s;elf; and if it was not, it might as well be publick a&s;terwards, as now; and that, at lea&s;t, &s;he ought to leave it where &s;he found it, and not hand it forwards to any body without my Con&s;ent: The&s;e prudent Mea&s;ures were inexpre&s;&s;ibly kind, as well as &s;ea&s;onable; for it had been likely enough that her Letter might have come publickly to me, and tho' my Husband wou'd not have open'd it, yet it wou'd have look'd a little odd that I &s;hou'd conceal its Contents from him, when I had pre|tended &s;o much to communicate all my Affairs.</P>
<P>In Con&s;equence of this wi&s;e Caution, my good Friend only wrote me in few Words, That the impertinent young Woman had been with her, as &s;he expected &s;he wou'd; and that &s;he thought it wou'd be very convenient that, if I cou'd &s;pare <HI>Cherry,</HI> I wou'd &s;end her up, (meaning <HI>Amy)</HI> becau&s;e &s;he found there might be &s;ome Occa&s;ion for her.</P>
<P>As it happen'd, this Letter was enclos'd to <HI>Amy</HI> her|&s;elf, and not &s;ent by the Way I had at fir&s;t order'd; but
<PB N="325" REF="323">
it came &s;afe to my Hands; and tho' I was alarm'd a lit|tle at it, yet I was not acquainted with the Danger I was in of an immediate Vi&s;it from this teizing Creature, till afterwards; and I run a greater Ri&s;que indeed, than ordi|ry, in that I did not &s;end <HI>Amy</HI> up under fourteen Days, believing my&s;elf as much concealed at <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> as if I had been at <HI>Vienna.</HI></P>
<P>But the Concern my faithful SPY, <HI>(for &s;uch my</HI> QUAKER <HI>was now, upon the meer foot of her own Sa|gacity)</HI> I &s;ay, her Concern for me, was my Safety in this Exigence, when I was, as it were, keeping no Guard for my&s;elf; for finding <HI>Amy</HI> not come up, and that &s;he did not know how &s;oon this wild Thing might put her de&s;ign'd Ramble in Practice, &s;he &s;ent a Me&s;|&s;enger to the Captain's Wife's Hou&s;e, where &s;he lodg'd, to tell her that &s;he wanted to &s;peak with her: She was at the Heels of the Me&s;&s;enger, and came eager for &s;ome News; and hop'd, &s;he &s;aid the Lady (meaning me) had been come to Town.</P>
<P>The QUAKER, with as much Caution as &s;he was Mi&s;tre&s;s of, not to tell a downright Lye, made her be|lieve &s;he expected to hear of me very quickly; and fre|quently by the by, &s;peaking of being Abroad to take the Air, talk'd of the Country about <HI>Bury,</HI> how plea&s;ant it was, how whole&s;ome, and how fine an Air; how the <HI>Downs</HI> about <HI>Newmarket</HI> were exceeding fine; and what a va&s;t deal of Company there was, now the Court was there; till at la&s;t, the Girl began to conclude, that <HI>my Lady&s;hip</HI> was gone thither; for, &s;he &s;aid, She knew I lov'd to &s;ee a great deal of Company.</P>
<P>Nay, <HI>&s;ays my Friend,</HI> thou take&s;t me wrong, I did not &s;ugge&s;t, &s;ays &s;he, that the Per&s;on thou enquir'&s;t after is gone thither, neither do I believe &s;he is, I a&s;&s;ure thee: Well, the Girl &s;mil'd, and let her know, that &s;he be|liev'd it for all that; &s;o, to clench it fa&s;t, Verily, <HI>&s;ays &s;he, with great Seriou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> thou do&s;t not do well, for thou &s;u&s;pecte&s;t every Thing, and believe&s;t nothing: I &s;peak &s;olemnly to thee, that I do not believe they are gone that Way; &s;o if thou give&s;t thy&s;elf the Trouble to go that Way, and art di&s;appointed, do not &s;ay that I
<PB N="326" REF="324">
have deceiv'd thee: She knew well enough, that if this did abate her Su&s;picion, it wou'd not remove it; and that it wou'd do little more than amu&s;e her; but by this &s;he kept her in &s;u&s;pence till <HI>Amy</HI> came up, and that was enough.</P>
<P>When <HI>Amy</HI> came up, &s;he was quite confounded, to hear the Relation which the QUAKER gave her, and found Means to acquaint me of it; only letting me know, to my great Satisfaction, that &s;he wou'd not come to <HI>Tunbridge</HI> fir&s;t; but that &s;he wou'd certainly go to <HI>New|market</HI> or <HI>Bury</HI> fir&s;t.</P>
<P>However, it gave me very great Unea&s;ine&s;s; for as &s;he re&s;olv'd to ramble in &s;earch after me, over the whole Country, I was &s;afe no where, no, not in <HI>Holland</HI> it&s;elf; &s;o indeed, I did not know what to do with her: and thus I had a <HI>Bitter</HI> in all my <HI>Sweet,</HI> for I was continu|ally perplexed with this Hu&s;&s;y, and thought &s;he haunted me like an Evil Spirit.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, <HI>Amy</HI> was next Door to &s;tark-mad about her; &s;he dur&s;t not &s;ee her at my Lodgings, for her Life; and &s;he went Days without Number, to <HI>Spit|tle-Fields,</HI> where &s;he us'd to come, and to her former Lodging, and cou'd never meet with her; at length, &s;he took up a mad Re&s;olution, that &s;he wou'd go direct|ly to the Captain's Hou&s;e in <HI>Redriff,</HI> and &s;peak with her; it was a mad Step, that's true, but, as <HI>Amy</HI> &s;aid, &s;he was mad, &s;o nothing &s;he cou'd do cou'd be otherwi&s;e: For if <HI>Amy</HI> had found her at <HI>Redriff,</HI> &s;he <HI>(the Girl)</HI> wou'd have concluded pre&s;ently, that the QUAKER had given her Notice, and &s;o that we were all of a Knot, and that, in &s;hort, all &s;he had &s;aid was right: But as it happen'd, things came to hit better than we expected; for that <HI>Amy</HI> going out of a Coach, to take Water at <HI>Tower-Wharf,</HI> meets the Girl ju&s;t come on Shore, hav|ing cro&s;s'd the Water from <HI>Redriff: Amy</HI> made as if &s;he wou'd have pa&s;s'd by her, tho' they met &s;o full that &s;he did not pretend &s;he did not &s;ee her, for &s;he look'd fairly upon her fir&s;t, but then turning her Head away, with a Slight, offer'd to go from her; but the Girl &s;topp'd, and &s;poke fir&s;t, and made &s;ome Manners to her.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="325">
<HI>Amy</HI> &s;poke coldly to her, and a little angry, and after &s;ome Words, &s;tanding in the Street, or Pa&s;&s;age, <HI>the Girl &s;aying,</HI> &s;he &s;eemed to be angry, and wou'd not have &s;poken to her: <HI>Why, &s;ays</HI> Amy, <HI>How can you ex|pect I &s;hou'd have any more to &s;ay to you, after I had done &s;o much for you, and you have behav'd &s;o to me?</HI> The Girl &s;eem'd to take no Notice of that now, but an|&s;wer'd, <HI>I was going to wait on you now:</HI> Wait on me! <HI>&s;ays Amy,</HI> What do you mean by that? Why, <HI>&s;ays &s;he a|gain, with a kind of Familiarity,</HI> I was going to your Lodgings.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was provok'd to the la&s;t Degree at her; and yet &s;he thought it was not her Time to re&s;ent, becau&s;e &s;he had a more fatal and wicked De&s;ign in her Head, a|gain&s;t her; which indeed, I never knew till after it was executed, nor dur&s;t <HI>Amy</HI> ever communicate it to me; for as I had always expre&s;s'd my&s;elf vehemently again&s;t hurt|ing a Hair of her Head, &s;o &s;he was re&s;olv'd to take her own Mea&s;ures without con&s;ulting me any more.</P>
<P>In order to this, <HI>Amy</HI> gave her good Words, and con|cealed her Re&s;entment as much as &s;he cou'd; and when &s;he talk'd of going to her Lodging, <HI>Amy</HI> &s;miled, and &s;aid nothing, but call'd for a Pair of Oars to go to <HI>Greenwich;</HI> and ask'd her, &s;eeing &s;he &s;aid &s;he was going to her Lodging, to go along with her, for &s;he was going Home, and was all alone.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> did this with &s;uch a Stock of A&s;&s;urance, that the Girl was confounded, and knew not what to &s;ay; but the more &s;he he&s;itated, the more <HI>Amy</HI> pre&s;s'd her to go; and talking very kindly to her, <HI>told her,</HI> If &s;he did not go to &s;ee her Lodgings, &s;he might go to keep her Company, and &s;he wou'd pay a Boat to bring her back again; &s;o, <HI>in a Word, Amy</HI> prevailed on her to go into the Boat with her, and carry'd her down to <HI>Greenwich.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis certain <HI>Amy</HI> had no more Bu&s;ine&s;s at <HI>Greenwich</HI> than I had; nor was &s;he going thither; but we were all hamper'd to the la&s;t Degree, with the Impertinence of this Creature; and in particular, I was horribly per|plexed with it.</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="326">
As they were in the Boat, <HI>Amy</HI> began to reproach her with Ingratitude, in treating her &s;o rudely, who had done &s;o much for her, and been &s;o kind to her; and to ask her what &s;he had got by it? or what &s;he expect|ed to get? Then came in my Share, the Lady <HI>Roxana. Amy</HI> je&s;ted with that, and banter'd her a little; <HI>and ask'd her,</HI> if &s;he had found her yet?</P>
<P>But <HI>Amy</HI> was both &s;urpriz'd and enrag'd, when the Girl told her roundly, That &s;he thank'd her for what &s;he had done for her; but that &s;he wou'd not have her think &s;he was &s;o ignorant, as not to know that what &s;he <HI>[Amy]</HI> had done, was by her Mother's Order; and who &s;he was beholden to for it: That &s;he cou'd never make In&s;truments pa&s;s for Principals, and pay the Debt to the Agent, when the Obligation was all to the Ori|ginal: That &s;he knew well enough who &s;he was, and who &s;he was employ'd by: That &s;he knew the Lady&mdash;very well, <HI>(naming the Name that I now went by)</HI> which was my Husband's true Name, and by which &s;he might know whether &s;he had found out her Mother or no.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> wi&s;h'd her at the Bottom of the <HI>Thames;</HI> and had there been no Watermen in the Boat, and no body in &s;ight, <HI>&s;he &s;wore to me,</HI> &s;he wou'd have thrown her into the River: I was horribly di&s;turb'd when &s;he told me this Story, and began to think this wou'd, at la&s;t, all end in my Ruin; but when <HI>Amy</HI> &s;poke of throwing her into the River, and drowning her, I was &s;o pro|vok'd at her, that all my Rage turn'd again&s;t <HI>Amy,</HI> and I fell thorowly out with her: I had now kept <HI>Amy</HI> al|mo&s;t thirty Years, and found her, on all Occa&s;ions, the faithfulle&s;t Creature to me, that ever Woman had; <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> faithful to me; for however wicked &s;he was, &s;till &s;he was true to me; and even this Rage of hers was all upon my Account, and for fear any Mi&s;chief &s;hou'd befal me.</P>
<P>But be that how it wou'd, I cou'd not bear the Men|tion of her Murthering the poor Girl, and it put me &s;o be&s;ide my&s;elf, that I ro&s;e up in a Rage, and bade her get out of my Sight, and out of my Hou&s;e; told her, I had kept her too long, and that I wou'd never &s;ee

her Face more. I had before told her, That &s;he was a Murtherer, and a bloody minded Creature; that &s;he cou'd not but know that I cou'd not bear the Thought of it, much le&s;s the Mention of it; and that it was the impu|dente&s;t Thing that ever was known, to make &s;uch a Propo&s;al to me, when &s;he knew that I was really the Mother of this Girl, and that &s;he was my own Child; that it was wicked enough in her, but that &s;he mu&s;t con|clude I was ten Times wickeder than her&s;elf, if I cou'd come into it: That the Girl was in the right, and I had nothing to blame her for; but that it was owing to the Wickedne&s;s of my Life, that made it nece&s;&s;ary for me to keep her from a Di&s;covery; but that I wou'd not murther my Child, tho' I was otherwi&s;e to be ruined by it: <HI>Amy</HI> reply'd &s;omewhat rough and &s;hort, Would I not, but &s;he wou'd, &s;he &s;aid, if &s;he had an Opportu|nity: and upon the&s;e Words it was that I bade her get out of my Sight, and out of my Hou&s;e; and it went &s;o far, that <HI>Amy</HI> pack'd up her Auls, and march'd off, and was gone for almo&s;t good and all: <HI>But of that in its Order; I mu&s;t go back to the Relation of the Voyage which they made to</HI> Greenwich <HI>together.</HI></P>
<P>They held on the Wrangle all the Way by Water; the Girl in&s;i&s;ted upon her knowing that I was her Mo|ther, and told her all the Hi&s;tory of my Life in the <HI>Pall|mall,</HI> as well after her being turn'd away, as before; and of my Marriage &s;ince, and which was wor&s;e, not only who my pre&s;ent Husband was, but where he had lived, <HI>viz.</HI> at <HI>Roan</HI> in <HI>France.</HI> She knew nothing of <HI>Pa|ris,</HI> or of where we were going to live, <HI>Namely,</HI> at <HI>Nim|guen; but told her in &s;o many Words,</HI> That if &s;he could not find me here, &s;he would go to <HI>Holland</HI> after me.</P>
<P>They landed at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> and <HI>Amy</HI> carried her into the Park with her, and they walk'd above two Hours there, in the farthe&s;t and remote&s;t Walks.; which <HI>Amy</HI> did, becau&s;e as they talk'd with great Heat, it was ap|parent they were quarrelling, and the People took No|tice of it.</P>
<P>They walk'd till they came almo&s;t to the Wilderne&s;s, at the <HI>South</HI> &s;ide of the Park; but the Girl perceiving</P>

<HI>Amy</HI> offer'd to go there, among the Woods, and Trees, &s;topp'd &s;hort there, and wou'd go no farther; but &s;aid, She wou'd not go in there.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> &s;mil'd, and ask'd her what was the Matter? <HI>She replied &s;hort,</HI> She did not know where &s;he was, nor where &s;he was going to carry her, and &s;he wou'd go no farther; and without any more Ceremony, turns back, and walks apace away from her: <HI>Amy</HI> own'd &s;he was &s;ur|priz'd, and came back too, and call'd to her; upon which the Girl &s;topt, and <HI>Amy</HI> coming up to her, ask'd her, what &s;he meant?</P>
<P>The Girl boldly reply'd, She did not know but &s;he might murther her; and that, in &s;hort, &s;he wou'd not tru&s;t her&s;elf with her; and never wou'd come into her Company again alone.</P>
<P>It was very provoking, but however, <HI>Amy</HI> kept her Temper, with much Difficulty, and bore it, knowing that much might depend upon it; &s;o &s;he mock'd her fooli&s;h Jealou&s;y, and told her &s;he need not be unea&s;y for her, &s;he wou'd do her no Harm, and wou'd have done her Good, if &s;he wou'd have let her; but &s;ince &s;he was of &s;uch a re&s;ractory Humour, &s;he &s;hou'd not trouble her&s;elf, for &s;he &s;hou'd never come into her Company again; and that neither &s;he, or her Brother, or Si&s;ter, &s;hou'd ever hear from her, or &s;ee her any more; and &s;o &s;he &s;hou'd have the Satisfaction of being the Ruin of her Brother and Si&s;ter, as well as of her&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Girl &s;eem'd a little mollified at that, <HI>and &s;aid</HI> That for her&s;elf, &s;he knew the wor&s;t of it, &s;he cou'd &s;eek her Fortune; but 'twas hard her Brother and Si&s;ter &s;hou'd &s;uffer on her Score; and &s;aid &s;omething that was tender, and well enough, on that Account: <HI>But Amy told her,</HI> It was for her to take that into Con&s;ideration for &s;he wou'd let her &s;ee that it was all her own; that &s;he wou'd have done them all Good, but that having been us'd thus, &s;he wou'd do no more for any of them; and that &s;he &s;hou'd; not need to be afraid to come into he$ Company again, for &s;he wou'd never give her Occa|&s;ion for, it any more; <HI>this, by the Way,</HI> was fal&s;e in the Girl

too, for &s;he did venture into <HI>Amy's</HI> Company again after that, once too much, <HI>as I &s;hall relate by it&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>They grew cooler however, afterwards, and <HI>Amy</HI> carry'd her into a Hou&s;e at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> where &s;he was acquainted, and took an Occa&s;ion to leave the Girl in a Room a while, to &s;peak to the People in the Hou&s;e, and &s;o prepare them to own her as a Lodger in the Hou&s;e; and then going in to her again, told her, There &s;he lodg'd, if &s;he had a Mind to find her out; or if any body el&s;e had any Thing to &s;ay to her; and &s;o <HI>Amy</HI> di&s;|mi&s;s'd her, and got rid of her again; and finding an empty Hackney Coach in the Town, came away by Land to <HI>London,</HI> and the Girl going down to the Wa|ter-&s;ide, came by Boat.</P>
<P>This Conver&s;ation did not an&s;wer <HI>Amy's</HI> End at-all, becau&s;e it did not &s;ecure the Girl from pur&s;uing her De&s;ign of hunting me out; and tho' my indefatigable Friend the QUAKER amus'd her three or four Days, yet I had &s;uch Notice of it at la&s;t, that I thought fit to come away from <HI>Tunbridge</HI> upon it, and where to go I knew not; but, in &s;hort, I went to a little Village upon <HI>Epping-Forre&s;t,</HI> call'd <HI>Woodford,</HI> and took Lodgings in a Private Hou&s;e, where I liv'd retir'd about fix Weeks, till I thought &s;he might be tir'd of her Search, and have given me over.</P>
<P>Here I receiv'd an Account from my tru&s;ty QUAKER, that the Wench had really been at <HI>Tubridge,</HI> had found out my Lodgings, and had told her Tale there in a mo&s;t di&s;mal Tone; that &s;he had follow'd us as &s;he thought, to <HI>London;</HI> but the QUAKER had an&s;wer'd her, That &s;he knew nothing of it, which was indeed true; and had admoni&s;hed her to be ea&s;y, and not to hunt af|ter People of &s;uch Fa&s;hion as we were, as if we were Thieves; that &s;he might be a&s;&s;ured, that &s;ince I was not willing to &s;ee her, I wou'd not be forced to do it; and treating me thus wou'd effectually di&s;oblige me: And with &s;uch Di&s;cour&s;es as the&s;e &s;he quieted her; and <HI>&s;he (the</HI> QUAKER) <HI>added,</HI> that &s;he hoped I &s;hould not be troubled much more with her.</P>

<P>When I had her, I dur&s;t ask her no Que&s;tions, nor hardly knew which End of the Bu&s;ine&s;s to begin to talk of; but of her own Accord &s;he told me, that the Girl had been three or four Times haunting her for News from me; and that &s;he had been &s;o trouble&s;ome, that &s;he had been obliged to &s;hew her&s;elf a little angry with her, and, <HI>at la&s;t, told her plainly,</HI> that &s;he need give her&s;elf no Trouble in &s;earching after me, by her Means; for &s;he <HI>(the</HI> QUAKER) would not tell her, if &s;he knew; upon which &s;he refrain'd a while. But on the other Hand, <HI>&s;he told me,</HI> it was not &s;afe for me to &s;end my Coach for her to come in; for &s;he had &s;ome Rea&s;on to believe, that &s;he <HI>(my Daughter)</HI> watch'd her Door Night and Day, nay, and watch'd her too every Time &s;he went in and out; for &s;he was &s;o bent upon a Di&s;covery, that &s;he &s;pared no Pains; and &s;he believed &s;he had taken a Lodging ve|ry near their Hou&s;e for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="333" REF="331">
I could hardly give her a Hearing of all this, for my Eagerne&s;s to ask for <HI>Amy;</HI> but I was confounded when &s;he told me &s;he had heard nothing of her; 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the anxious Thoughts that rowl'd about in my Mind, and continually perplexed me about her; par|ticularly, I reproach'd my&s;elf with my Ra&s;hne&s;s in turn|ing away &s;o faithful a Creature, that for &s;o many Years had not only been a Servant, but an Agent; and not only an Agent, but a Friend, and a faithful Friend too.</P>
<P>Then I con&s;ider'd too, that <HI>Amy</HI> knew all the Secret Hi&s;tory of my Life, had been in all the Intrigues of it, and been a Party in both Evil and Good, and at be&s;t, there was no Policy in it; that as it was very ungene|rous and unkind, to run Things to &s;uch an Extremity with her, and for an Occa&s;ion too, in which all the Fault &s;he was guilty of, was owing to her Exce&s;s of Care for my Safety; &s;o it mu&s;t be only her &s;teddy Kind|ne&s;s to me, and an Exce&s;s of generous Friend&s;hip for me, that &s;hould keep her from ill-u&s;ing me in Return for it; which ill-u&s;ing me was enough in her Power, and might be my utter Undoing.</P>
<P>The&s;e Thoughts perplex'd me exceedingly, and what Cour&s;e to take, I really did not know. I began indeed to give <HI>Amy</HI> quite over, for &s;he had now been gone a|bove a Fortnight; and as &s;he had taken away all her Cloaths, and her Money too, <HI>which was not a little,</HI> and &s;o had no Occa&s;ion of that kind to come any more, &s;o &s;he had not left any Word where &s;he was gone, or to which Part of the World I might &s;end to hear of her.</P>
<P>And I was troubled on another Account too, <HI>viz.</HI> That my Spou&s;e and I too had re&s;olved to do very hand|&s;omely for <HI>Amy,</HI> without con&s;idering what &s;he might have got another Way at all; but we had &s;aid nothing of it to her; and &s;o I thought, as &s;he had not known what was likely to fall in her Way, &s;he had not the In|fluence of that Expectation to make her come back.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, the Perplexity of this Girl, who hunted me, as if, <HI>like a Hound,</HI> &s;he had had a hot Scent, but was now at a Fault; <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> that Perplexity, and
<PB N="334" REF="332">
this other Part, of <HI>Amy</HI> being gone, i&s;&s;ued in this, I re|&s;olved to be gone, and go over to <HI>Holland;</HI> there I be|lieved I &s;hould be at re&s;t. So I took Occa&s;ion one Day to tell my Spou&s;e, that I was afraid he might take it ill that I had amus'd him thus long, and that, <HI>at la&s;t,</HI> I doubted I was not with Child; and that &s;ince it was &s;o, our Things being pack'd up, and all in Order for going to <HI>Holland,</HI> I would go away now, when he pleas'd.</P>
<P>My Spou&s;e, who was perfectly ea&s;y, whether in go|ing or &s;taying, left it all entirely to me; &s;o I con&s;ider'd of it, and began to prepare again for my Voyage; but alas! I was irre&s;olute to the la&s;t Degree. I was, for Want of <HI>Amy,</HI> de&s;titute; I had lo&s;t my Right-hand, &s;he was my Steward, gather'd in my Rents, <HI>I mean my In|tere&s;t-money,</HI> and kept my Accompts, and, <HI>in a Word</HI> did all my Bu&s;ine&s;s, and without her indeed I knew not how to go away, or how to &s;tay. But an Accident thru&s;t it&s;elf in here, and that even in <HI>Amy</HI>'s Conduct too which frighted me away, and without her too in the ut|mo&s;t Horror and Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>I have related how my faithful Friend the QUAKER was come to me, and what Account &s;he gave me of he being continually haunted by my Daughter; and that <HI>as &s;he &s;aid,</HI> &s;he watch'd her very Door, Night and Day <HI>the Truth was,</HI> &s;he had &s;et a SPY to watch &s;o effectually that <HI>&s;he (the Quaker)</HI> neither went in or out, but <HI>&s;he</HI> had Notice of it.</P>
<P>This was too evident, when the next Morning after &s;he came to me, <HI>(for I kept her all Night)</HI> to my un|&s;peakable Surprize, I &s;aw a Hackney-Coach &s;top at the Door where I lodg'd, and &s;aw her <HI>(my Daughter)</HI> in the Coach all alone. It was a very good Chance in the middle of a bad one, that my Husband had taken out the Coach that very Morning, and was gone to <HI>London</HI> as for me, I had neither Life or Soul left in me, I was &s;o confounded, I knew not what to do or to &s;ay.</P>
<P>My <HI>happy Vi&s;itor</HI> had more Pre&s;ence of Mind than $$ <HI>and ask'd me,</HI> if I had made no Acquaintance among the Neighbours? <HI>I told her,</HI> Yes, there was a Lady lodg'd two Doors off, that I was very intimate with; but ha&s;$
<PB N="335" REF="333">
ha&s;t <HI>thou</HI> no Way out backward to go to her? <HI>&s;ays &s;he.</HI> Now it happened there was a Back-Door in the Garden, by which we u&s;ually went and come to and from the Hou&s;e; &s;o I told her of it. <HI>Well, well,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>go out and make a Vi&s;it then, and leave the re&s;t to me.</HI> A|way I run, told the Lady, <HI>(for I was very free there)</HI> that I was a Widow to Day, my Spou&s;e being gone to <HI>London,</HI> &s;o I came not to vi&s;it her, but to dwell with her that Day; becau&s;e al&s;o, our Landlady had got Strang|ers from <HI>London.</HI> So having fram'd this orderly LYE, I pull'd &s;ome Work out of my Pocket, <HI>and added,</HI> I did not come to be idle.</P>
<P>As I went out one Way, my Friend the QUAKER went the other, to receive this unwelcome Gue&s;t. The Girl made but little Ceremony; but having bid the Coachman ring at the Gate, gets down out of the Coach, and comes to the Door; a Country-Girl going to the Door, (belonging to the Hou&s;e) for the QUAKER forbid any of my Maids going. <HI>Madam</HI> ask'd for my QUAKER by Name, and the Girl ask'd her to walk in.</P>
<P>Upon this, my QUAKER &s;eeing there was no hang|ing-back, goes to her immediately, but put on all the Gravity upon her Countenance that &s;he was Mi&s;tre&s;s of; and that was not a little indeed.</P>
<P>When <HI>&s;he (the</HI> QUAKER) came into the Room, <HI>(for they had &s;hewed my Daughter into a little Parlour)</HI> &s;he kept her grave Countenance, but &s;aid not a Word; nor did my <HI>Daughter</HI> &s;peak a good while; but after &s;ome Time, my <HI>Girl</HI> began, <HI>and &s;aid,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e you know me, Madam.</P>

<P>Here the Girl importun'd her again, with the utmo&s;t Earne&s;tne&s;s, and cry'd bitterly; in&s;omuch, that my
<PB N="337" REF="335">
poor QUAKER was &s;oftened with it, and began to per|&s;wade me to con&s;ider of it, and, if it might con&s;i&s;t with my Affairs, to &s;ee her, and hear what &s;he had to &s;ay; but this was afterwards. <HI>I return to the Di&s;cour&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>The QUAKER was perplex'd with her a long Time; &s;he talk'd of &s;ending back the Coach, and lying in the Town all Night. This my Friend knew would be ve|ry unea&s;y to me, but &s;he dur&s;t not &s;peak a Word again&s;t it; but on a &s;udden Thought, &s;he offered a bold Stroke, which, tho' dangerous if it had happened wrong, had its de&s;ired Effect.</P>
<P><HI>She told her,</HI> That as for di&s;mi&s;&s;ing her Coach, that was as &s;he plea&s;ed; &s;he believed, &s;he would not ea&s;ily get a Lodging in the Town; but that as &s;he was in a &s;trange Place, &s;he wou'd &s;o much befriend her, that &s;he wou'd &s;peak to the People of the Hou&s;e, that if they had Room, &s;he might have a Lodging there for one Night, rather than be forced back to <HI>London,</HI> before &s;he was free to go.</P>
<P>This was a cunning, tho' a dangerous Step, and it &s;ucceeded accordingly, for it amus'd the Creature en|tirely, and &s;he pre&s;ently concluded, that really I cou'd not be there then; otherwi&s;e &s;he wou'd never have ask'd her to lie in the Hou&s;e: So &s;he grew cold again pre&s;ent|ly, as to her lodging there; and &s;aid, No, &s;ince it was &s;o, &s;he wou'd go back that Afternoon, but &s;he would come again in two or three Days, and &s;earch that, and all the Towns round, in an effectual Manner, if &s;he &s;taid a Week or two to do it; for in &s;hort, if I was in <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Holland,</HI> &s;he wou'd find me.</P>
<P>In Truth, &s;ays the QUAKER, thou wilt make me very hurtful to <HI>thee</HI> then: Why &s;o, <HI>&s;ays &s;he?</HI> Becau&s;e wherever I go, <HI>thou</HI> wilt put <HI>thy&s;elf</HI> to great Expence, and the Country to a great deal of unnece&s;&s;ary Trouble. Not unnece&s;&s;ary, <HI>&s;ays &s;he.</HI> Yes truly, <HI>&s;ays the</HI> QUAKER, it mu&s;t be unnece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e it will be to no Purpo&s;e; I think I mu&s;t abide in my own Hou&s;e, to &s;ave <HI>thee</HI> that Charge and Trouble.</P>
<P>She &s;aid little to that, except that, <HI>&s;he &s;aid,</HI> &s;he would give her as little Trouble as po&s;&s;ible; but &s;he was afraid
<PB N="338" REF="336">
&s;he &s;hould &s;ometimes be unea&s;y to her, which &s;he hop'd &s;he would excu&s;e. My QUAKER <HI>told her,</HI> She would much rather excu&s;e her, if &s;he would forbear; for that, if &s;he would believe her, &s;he would a&s;&s;ure her, &s;he &s;hould never get any Intelligence of me, by her.</P>
<P>That &s;et her into Tears again; but after a while re|covering her&s;elf, <HI>&s;he told her,</HI> Perhaps &s;he might be mi&s;|taken; and &s;he <HI>(the</HI> QUAKER) &s;hould watch her&s;elf, ve|ry narrowly; or &s;he might one Time or another get &s;ome Intelligence from her, whether &s;he would or no; and &s;he was &s;atisfy'd &s;he had gain'd &s;ome of her by this Journey; for that if I was not in the Hou&s;e, I was not far off; and if I did not remove very quickly, &s;he would find me out. Very well, <HI>&s;ays my</HI> QUAKER; then if the Lady is not willing to &s;ee <HI>thee, thou</HI> give&s;t me No|tice to tell her, that &s;he may get out of <HI>thy</HI> Way.</P>
<P>She flew out in a Rage at that, <HI>and told my Friend,</HI> that if &s;he did, a Cur&s;e would follow her, and her Children after her; and denounc'd &s;uch horrid Things upon her, as frighted the poor tender-hearted QUAKER &s;trangely, and put her more out of Temper than ever I &s;aw her be|fore; &s;o that &s;he re&s;olved to go Home the next Morn|ing; and I, that was ten times more unea&s;y than &s;he, re|&s;olved to follow her, and go to <HI>London</HI> too; which how|ever, upon &s;econd Thoughts, I did not; but took effec|tual Mea&s;ures not to be &s;een or own'd, if &s;he came any more; but I heard no more of her for &s;ome Time.</P>
<P>I &s;tayed there about a Fortnight, and in all that Time I heard no more of her, or of my QUAKER about her; but after about two Days more, I had a Letter from my QUAKER, intimating, that &s;he had &s;omething of Mo|ment to &s;ay, that &s;he could not communicate by a Let|ter, but wi&s;h'd I would give my&s;elf the Trouble to come up; directing me to come with the Coach into <HI>Good|man's-fields,</HI> and then walk to her Back-door on Foot, which being left upon on Purpo&s;e, the watchful Lady, if &s;he had any Spies, could not well &s;ee me.</P>
<P>My Thoughts had for &s;o long Time been kept, as it were, waking, that almo&s;t every Thing gave me the Alarm, and this e&s;pecially, &s;o that I was very unea&s;y;
<PB N="339" REF="337">
but I could not bring Matters to bear, to make my com|ing to <HI>London</HI> &s;o clear to my Husband as I would have done; for he lik'd the Place, and had a Mind, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> to &s;tay a little longer, if it was not again&s;t my Inclina|tion; &s;o I wrote my Friend the QUAKER Word, <HI>That I could not come to Torvn yet;</HI> and that be&s;ides, I could not think of being there under Spies, and afraid to look out of Doors; and &s;o, <HI>in &s;hort,</HI> I put off going for near a Fortnight more.</P>
<P>At the End of that Time &s;he wrote again, <HI>in which &s;he told me,</HI> That &s;he had not lately &s;een the <HI>impertinent Vi&s;itor,</HI> which had been &s;o trouble&s;ome; but that &s;he had &s;een my <HI>tru&s;ty Agent Amy,</HI> who told her &s;he had cry'd for &s;ix Weeks without Intermi&s;&s;ion; that <HI>Amy</HI> had given her an Account how trouble&s;ome the Creature had been, and to what Straights and Perplexities I was driven, by her hunting after, and following me from Place to Place. Upon which, <HI>Amy</HI> had &s;aid, That notwith|&s;tanding I was angry with her, and had us'd her &s;o hard|ly, for &s;aying &s;omething about her of the &s;ame kind; yet there was an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ecuring her, and removing her out of the Way; and that, <HI>in &s;hort,</HI> with|out asking my Leave, or any Body's Leave, &s;he would take Care &s;he &s;hould trouble her Mi&s;tre&s;s <HI>(meaning me)</HI> no more; and that after <HI>Amy</HI> had &s;aid &s;o, &s;he had in|deed never heard any more of the Girl; &s;o that &s;he &s;up|po&s;ed <HI>Amy</HI> had manag'd it &s;o well, as to put an End to it.</P>
<P>The innocent well-meaning Creature, my QUAKER, who was all Kindne&s;s and Goodne&s;s in her&s;elf, <HI>and parti|cularly to me,</HI> &s;aw nothing in this, but &s;he thought <HI>Amy</HI> had found &s;ome Way to per&s;wade her to be quiet and ea&s;y, and to give over teizing and following me, and rejoic'd in it for my Sake; as &s;he thought nothing of a|ny Evil her&s;elf, &s;o &s;he &s;u&s;pected none in any Body el&s;e, and was exceeding glad of having &s;uch good News to write to me. But my Thoughts of it run otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>I was &s;truck, as with a Bla&s;t from Heaven, at the reading her Letter; I fell into a Fit of trembling from Head to Foot, and I ran raving about the Room like a
<PB N="340" REF="338">
mad Woman; I had no Body to &s;peak a Word to, to give Vent to my Pa&s;&s;ion; nor did I &s;peak a Word for a good while, till after it had almo&s;t overcome me. I threw my&s;elf upon the Bed, and cry'd out, <HI>Lord be mer|ciful to me, &s;he has murdered my Child,</HI> and with that, a Flood of Tears bur&s;t out, and I cry'd vehemently for above an Hour.</P>
<P>My Husband was very happily gone out a hunting, &s;o that I had the Opportunity of being alone, and to give my Pa&s;&s;ions &s;ome Vent, by which I a little recovered my&s;elf. But after my Crying was over, then I fell in a new Rage at <HI>Amy,</HI> I called her a thou&s;and Devils, and Mon&s;ters, and hard-hearted Tygers; I reproach'd her with her knowing that I abhor'd it, and had let her know it &s;ufficiently, in that I had, <HI>as it were,</HI> kick'd her out of Doors, after &s;o many Years Friend&s;hip and Service, only for naming it to me.</P>
<P>Well, after &s;ome Time my Spou&s;e came in from his Sport, and I put on the be&s;t Looks I could to deceive him; but he did not take &s;o little Notice of me, as not to &s;ee I had been crying, and that &s;omething troubled me; and he pre&s;s'd me to tell him; I &s;eem'd to bring it out with Reluctance, <HI>but told him,</HI> My Backwardne&s;s was more becau&s;e I was a&s;hamed that &s;uch a Trifle &s;hould have any Effect upon me than for any Weight that was in it. So <HI>I told him,</HI> I had been vexing my|&s;elf about my Woman <HI>Amy</HI>'s not coming again; that &s;he might have known me better than not to believe I &s;hould have been Friends with her again, <HI>and the like;</HI> and that, <HI>in &s;hort,</HI> I had lo&s;t the be&s;t Servant by Ra&s;h|ne&s;s that ever Woman had.</P>
<P>Well, well, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> if that be all your Grief, I hope you will &s;oon &s;hake it off; I'll warrant you, in a little while we &s;hall hear of Mrs <HI>Amy</HI> again; and &s;o it went off for that Time. But it did not go off with me; for I was unea&s;y, and terrify'd to the la&s;t Degree, and want|ed to get &s;ome farther Account of the Thing. So I went to my &s;ure and certain Comforter the QUAKER, and there I had the whole Story of it; and the good in|nocent

QUAKER gave me Joy of my being rid of &s;uch an un&s;ufferable Tormentor.</P>
<P>Rid of her!

No, no, made her away! <HI>Amy</HI> didn't talk like that; I dare &s;ay, thou may'&s;t be ea&s;y in that, <HI>Amy</HI> has nothing of that in her Head, I dare &s;ay, &s;ays &s;he, and &s;o threw it, as it were, out of my Thoughts.</P>
<P>But it wou'd not do; it run in my Head continually, Night and Day I cou'd think of nothing el&s;e; and it fix'd &s;uch a Horror of the Fact upon my Spirits, and &s;uch a Dete&s;tation of <HI>Amy,</HI> whom I look'd upon as the Murderer, that, as for her, I believe, if I cou'd have &s;een her, I &s;hou'd certainly have &s;ent her to <HI>Newgate,</HI> or to a wor&s;e Place, upon Su&s;picion; indeed, I think I I cou'd have kill'd her with my own Hands.</P>
<P>As for the poor Girl her&s;elf, &s;he was ever before my Eyes; I &s;aw her by Night, and by Day; &s;he haunted my Imagination, if &s;he did not haunt the Hou&s;e; my Fancy &s;how'd her me in a hundred Shapes and Po&s;tures; &s;leeping or waking, &s;he was with me. Sometimes I thought I &s;aw her with her Throat cut, &s;ometimes with her Head cut, and her Brains knock'd out, other Times hang'd up upon a Beam, another Time drown'd in the Great Pond at <HI>Camberwell.</HI> And all the&s;e Appearances were terrifying to the la&s;t Degree; and that which was &s;till wor&s;e, I cou'd really hear nothing of her: I &s;ent to the Captain's Wife in <HI>Redriff, and &s;he an&s;wer'd me,</HI> She was gone to her Relations in <HI>Spittle-Fields,</HI> I &s;ent thi|ther, <HI>and they &s;aid,</HI> &s;he was there about three Weeks ago; but that &s;he went out in a Coach with the Gentle|woman that us'd to be &s;o kind to her, but whither &s;he was gone, they knew not; for &s;he had not been there &s;ince. I &s;ent back the Me&s;&s;enger for a De&s;cription of the Woman &s;he went out with; and they de&s;crib'd her &s;o perfectly, that I knew it to be <HI>Amy,</HI> and none but <HI>Amy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="340">
<HI>I &s;ent her Word again,</HI> That Mrs. <HI>Amy,</HI> who &s;he went out with, left her in two or three Hours; and that they &s;hou'd &s;earch for her, for I had Rea&s;on to fear &s;he was murder'd. This frighted them all intollerably; they believ'd <HI>Amy</HI> had carry'd her to pay her a Sum of Mo|ney, and that &s;omebody had watch'd her after her hav|ing receiv'd it, and had robb'd and murder'd her.</P>
<P>I believ'd nothing of that Part, but I believ'd as it was, That whatever was done, <HI>Amy</HI> had done it; and that, in &s;hort, <HI>Amy</HI> had made her away; and I believ'd it the more, becau&s;e <HI>Amy</HI> came no more near me, but confirm'd her Guilt by her Ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I mourn'd thus for her, for above a Month; but finding <HI>Amy</HI> &s;till not come near me, and that I mu&s;t put my Affairs in a Po&s;ture that I might go to <HI>Holland,</HI> I open'd all my Affairs to my dear tru&s;ty Friend, the QUAKER, and placed her, in Matters of Tru&s;t, in the Room of <HI>Amy,</HI> and with a heavy, bleed|ing Heart for my poor Girl, I embark'd with my Spou&s;e, and all our Equipage and Goods, on board ano|ther <HI>Holland Trader,</HI> not a Packet Boat, and went over to <HI>Holland;</HI> where I arrived, as I have &s;aid.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t put in a Caution however here, that you mu&s;t not under&s;tand me as if I let my Friend the QUAKER into any Part of the Secret Hi&s;tory of my former Life; nor did I commit the Grand re&s;erv'd Article of all, $t her, <HI>viz.</HI> that I was really the Girl's Mother, and the Lady <HI>Roxana;</HI> there was no need of that Part being ex|pos'd; and it was always a Maxim with me, <HI>That Se|crets &s;hou'd never be open'd, without evident Utility.</HI> It could be of no manner of U&s;e to me, or her, to commu|nicate that Part to her; be&s;ides, &s;he was too hone&s;t her&s;elf, to make it &s;afe to me, for tho' &s;he lov'd me &s;incerely, and it was plain, by many Circum&s;tances, that &s;he did &s;o, yet &s;he would not <HI>Lye</HI> for me upon Occa&s;ion, as <HI>Amy</HI> wou'd, and therefore it was not advi&s;able on any Terms to communicate that Part; for if the Girl or any one el&s;e, &s;hould have come to her afterwards, and put it home to her, Whether &s;he knew that I was the Girl's Mother or not; or was the &s;ame as the Lady <HI>Roxana,</HI> or
<PB N="343" REF="341">
not, &s;he either wou'd not have denied it, or would have done it with &s;o ill a Grace, &s;uch Blu&s;hing, &s;uch He&s;i|tations, and Fadl$rings in her An&s;wers, as wou'd have put the Matter out of doubt, and betray'd her&s;elf and the Secret too.</P>
<P>For this Rea&s;on, I &s;ay, I did not di&s;cover any thing of that kind to her; but I plac'd her, as I have &s;aid, in <HI>Amy</HI>'s &s;tead, in the other Affairs of receiving Money, Intere&s;ts, Rents, and the like, and &s;he was as faithful as <HI>Amy</HI> could be, and as diligent.</P>
<P>But there fell out a great Difficulty here, which I knew not how to get over; and this was, how to con|vey the u&s;ual Supply, or Provi&s;ion and Money, to the Uncle and the other Si&s;ter, who depended, e&s;pecially the Si&s;ter, upon the &s;aid Supply, for her Support; and indeed, tho' <HI>Amy</HI> had &s;aid ra&s;hly, that &s;he wou'd not take any more Notice of the Si&s;ter, and wou'd leave her to peri&s;h, as above, yet it was neither in my Na|ture, or <HI>Amy</HI>'s either, much le&s;s was it my De&s;ign; and therefore I re&s;olv'd to leave the Management of what I had re&s;erv'd for that Work, with my faithful QUA|KER, but how to direct her to manage them, was the great Difficulty.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> had told them in &s;o many Words, That &s;he was not their Mother, but that &s;he was the Maid <HI>Amy,</HI> that carried them to their Aunt's; that &s;he and their Mo|ther went over to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> to &s;eek their Fortune, and that there good Things had befallen them; and that their Mother was very rich and happy; that &s;he <HI>(Amy)</HI> had married in the <HI>Indies,</HI> but being now a Widow, and re&s;olving to come over to <HI>England,</HI> their Mother had obliged her to enquire them out, and do for them as &s;he had done; and that now &s;he was re&s;olved to go back to the <HI>Indies</HI> again; but that &s;he had Orders to do very hand&s;omely by them; and, <HI>in a Word,</HI> told them, She had 2000 <HI>l.</HI> a-piece for them, upon Condition that they proved &s;ober, and married &s;uitably to them&s;elves, and did not throw them&s;elves away up|on Scoundrels.</P>
<P>The good Family in who&s;e Care they had been, I had re&s;olved to take more than ordinary Notice of; and
<PB N="344" REF="342">
<HI>Amy,</HI> by my Order, had acquainted them with it, and obliged my Daughters to promi&s;e to &s;ubmit to their Government, as formerly, and to be ruled by the ho|ne&s;t Man, as by a Father and Coun&s;ellor; and engaged him to treat them as his Children; and to oblige him effectually to take Care of them, and to make his old Age comfortable both to him and his Wife, who had been &s;o good to the Orphans, I had ordered her to &s;et|tle the other 2000 <HI>l. that is to &s;ay,</HI> the Intere&s;t of it, which was 120 <HI>l.</HI> a Year, upon them, to be theirs for both their Lives; but to come to my two Daughters after them. This was &s;o ju&s;t, and was &s;o prudently managed by <HI>Amy,</HI> that nothing &s;he ever did for me, plea&s;ed me better. And in this Po&s;ture, leaving my two Daughters with their ancient Friend, and &s;o coming away to me, <HI>(as they thought to the</HI> Ea&s;t-Indies) &s;he had prepared every Thing in order to her going over with me to <HI>Holland;</HI> and in this Po&s;ture that Matter &s;tood when that unhappy Girl, <HI>who I have &s;aid &s;o much of,</HI> broke in upon all our Mea&s;ures, <HI>as you have heard;</HI> and by an Ob&s;tinacy never to be conquer'd or pacify'd, either with Threats or Per&s;wa&s;ions, pur&s;ued her Search after me <HI>(her Mother) as I have &s;aid,</HI> till &s;he brought me even to the Brink of De&s;truction, and wou'd, in all Probability, have traced me out at la&s;t, if <HI>Amy</HI> had not by the Violence of her Pa&s;&s;ion, and by a Way which I had no Knowledge of, and indeed abhor'd, put a Stop to her; of which I can|not enter into the Particulars here.</P>
<P>However, notwith&s;tanding this, I could not think of going away, and leaving this Work &s;o unfini&s;hed as <HI>Amy</HI> had threatned to do, and for the Folly of one Child, to leave the other to &s;tarve; or to &s;top my determined Bounty to the Good Family I have mentioned. So, <HI>in a Word,</HI> I committed the fini&s;hing it all to my faith|ful Friend the QUAKER, to whom I communicated as much of the old Story as was needful to empower her to perform what <HI>Amy</HI> had promi&s;ed; and to make her talk &s;o much to the Purpo&s;e, as one employed more remotely than <HI>Amy</HI> had been, needed to do.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="343">
To this Purpo&s;e, &s;he had fir&s;t of all a full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Money; and went fir&s;t to the hone&s;t Man and his Wife, and &s;ettled all the Matter with them; when &s;he talk'd of Mrs. <HI>Amy,</HI> &s;he talk'd of her as one that had been empower'd by the Mother of the Girls, in the <HI>In|dies,</HI> but was obliged to go back to the <HI>Indies,</HI> and had &s;ettled all &s;ooner, if &s;he had not been hinder'd by the ob&s;ti|nate Humour of the other Daughter; that &s;he had left In|&s;tructions with her for the re&s;t; but that the other had affronted her &s;o much, that &s;he was gone away without doing any Thing for her; and that now, if any Thing was done, it mu&s;t be by fre&s;h Orders from the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI></P>
<P>I need not &s;ay how punctually my new Agent acted; but which was more, &s;he brought the old Man and his Wife, and my other Daughter, &s;everal Times to her Hou&s;e, by which I had an Opportunity, <HI>being there on|ly as a Lodger, and a Stranger,</HI> to &s;ee my other Girl, which I had never done before, &s;ince &s;he was a little Child.</P>
<P>The Day I contriv'd to &s;ee them, I was dre&s;s'd up in a Quaker's Habit, and look'd &s;o like a Quaker, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for them, who had never &s;een me before, to &s;uppo&s;e I had never been any Thing el&s;e; al&s;o my Way of talking was &s;uitable enough to it, for I had learned that long before.</P>
<P>I have not Time here to take Notice what a Surprize it was to me to &s;ee my Child, how it work'd upon my Affections; with what infinite Struggle I ma&s;ter'd a &s;trong Inclination that I had to di&s;cover my&s;elf to her; how the Girl was the very Counterpart of my&s;elf, on|ly much hand&s;omer; and how &s;weetly and mode&s;tly &s;he behav'd; how on that Occa&s;ion I re&s;olv'd to do more for her, than I had appointed by <HI>Amy, and the like.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis enough to mention here, that as the &s;ettling this Affair made Way for my going on Board, notwith&s;tand|ing the Ab&s;ence of my old Agent <HI>Amy;</HI> &s;o however, I left &s;ome Hints for <HI>Amy</HI> too, for I did not yet de&s;pair of my hearing from her; and that if my good QUAKER
<PB N="346" REF="344">
&s;hould ever &s;ee her again, &s;he &s;hould let her &s;ee them; wherein particularly ordering her to leave the Affair of <HI>Spittle-fields</HI> ju&s;t as I had done, in the Hands of my Friend, &s;he &s;hould come away to me, upon this Condi|tion neverthele&s;s, that &s;he gave full Satisfaction to my Friend the QUAKER, that &s;he had not murdered my Child; for if &s;he had, <HI>I told her,</HI> I would never &s;ee her Face more. But, notwith&s;tanding this, &s;he came over afterwards, without giving my Friend any of that Satis|faction, or any Account that &s;he intended to come over.</P>
<P>I can &s;ay no more now, but that, <HI>as above,</HI> being ar|rived in <HI>Holland,</HI> with my Spou&s;e and his Son, <HI>formerly mentioned,</HI> I appeared there with all the Splendor and Equipage &s;uitable to our new Pro&s;pect, <HI>as I have already ob&s;erved.</HI></P>
<P>Here, after &s;ome Years of Flouri&s;hing, and outward|ly happy Circum&s;tances, I fell into a dreadful Cour&s;e of Calamities, and <HI>Amy</HI> al&s;o; the very Rever&s;e of our former good Days; the Bla&s;t of Heaven &s;eem'd to fol|low the Injury done the poor Girl, by us both; and I was brought &s;o low again, that my Repentance &s;eem'd to be only the Con&s;equence of my Mi&s;ery, as my Mi|&s;ery was of my Crime.</P>
