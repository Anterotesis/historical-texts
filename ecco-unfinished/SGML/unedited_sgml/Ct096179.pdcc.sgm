<L>Smit with the love of Song my youth e&s;&s;ay'd,</L>

<HEAD>The ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CARACTACUS,</HI> King of the <HI>Silures,</HI> having been defeated by <HI>OSTORIUS,</HI> the <HI>Roman</HI> Praefect, his Queen taken pri&s;oner, and his Son (as it is &s;uppo&s;ed) either &s;lain or fled, retired with his only Daughter, and took &s;anctuary among&s;t the <HI>DRUIDS</HI> in <HI>Mona. OSTORIUS,</HI> after the battle, leaving garri&s;ons in the conquered country, marched to &s;ubdue the northern part of <HI>Britain,</HI> and led his troops to the frontiers of the <HI>Brigantes,</HI> then governed by <HI>CARTISMANDUA</HI>. This Queen, dreading the victorious enemy, made a truce with him; one of the conditions of which was, that &s;he &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t the <HI>Romans</HI> in &s;ecuring the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> King, that he might be carried to <HI>Rome</HI> to grace the triumph of <HI>CLAUDIUS</HI>. She accordingly gave up her two Sons as Ho&s;tages, to be &s;ent them&s;elves to <HI>Rome,</HI> in ca&s;e they did not &s;educe <HI>CARACTACUS</HI> from his Sanc|tuary, to which place they were to be accompanied by <HI>AULUS DIDIUS,</HI> and a &s;ufficient force, to effect that de&s;ign.</P>
<P>The Drama opens on their arrival in the con&s;ecrated grove, a little before midnight, and about the time when the <HI>DRUIDS,</HI> who form the <HI>CHORUS,</HI> were preparing the ceremonial of <HI>CARACTACUS</HI>'s admi&s;&s;ion into their order. The two Princes are &s;eized as &s;pies, and the incidents, con&s;equent upon this, form what is called the <HI>EPISODE</HI> of the piece. The <HI>EXODE,</HI> or <HI>CATASTROPHE,</HI> is prepared by the coming of <HI>ARVIRAGUS</HI> the King's &s;on, who, having e&s;caped with life in the late battle, had employed the inter|mediate time in privately collecting his Father's &s;cattered forces, to put him again in a condition of facing the enemy. His bravery, in defending his Father and the <HI>DRUIDS,</HI> occa&s;ions the <HI>PERIPETIA,</HI> or change of fortune; and his death, with the final captivity of <HI>CARACTACUS,</HI> con|cludes the Tragedy.</P>

<P>Had I $ntended to give an exact copy of the an|tient Drama, your objections to the pre&s;ent Poem would be unan&s;werable. But my de&s;ign was much le&s;s confined. I meant only to pur&s;ue the antient me|thod, &s;o far as it is probable a Greek Poet, were he alive, would now do, in order to adapt him&s;elf to the genius of our times, and the character of our Trage|dy. According to this notion, every thing was to be al|lowed to the pre&s;ent ta&s;te, which nature and Ari&s;totle could po&s;&s;ibly di&s;pen&s;e with; and nothing of intrigue or refinement was to be admitted, at which antient judgment could rea&s;onably take offence. Good &s;en&s;e, as well as antiquity, pre&s;cribed an adherence to the three great Unities; the&s;e therefore were &s;trictly ob|&s;erved. But on the other hand, to follow the mo|dern ma&s;ters in tho&s;e re&s;pects wherein they had not &s;o faultily deviated from their predece&s;&s;ors, a &s;tory was
<PB N="294" REF="290">
cho&s;en, in which the tender rather than the noble pa&s;&s;ions were predominant, and in which even love had the principal &s;hare. Characters too were drawn as nearly approaching to private ones, as Tragic dig|nity would permit; and affections rai&s;ed rather from the impul&s;e of common humanity, than the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of royalty and the fate of kingdoms. Be&s;ide this, for the &s;ake of natural embelli&s;hment, and to reconcile mere modern readers to that &s;implicity of fable, in which I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to copy the Antients, I contrived to lay the &s;cene in an old romantic fore&s;t. For, by this means, I was enabled to enliven the Poem by various touches of pa&s;toral de&s;cription; not affectedly brought in from the &s;tore-hou&s;e of a pictu|re&s;que imagination, but nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ulting from the &s;cenery of the place it&s;elf: A beauty &s;o extremly &s;trik|ing in the COMUS of Milton, and the AS YOU LIKE IT of Shake&s;peare; and of which the Greek Mu&s;e (though fond of rural Imagery) has afforded few ex|amples, be&s;ides that admirable one in the PHILOCTE|TES of Sophocles.</P>
<P>By this idea I could wi&s;h you to regulate your cri|tici&s;m. I need not, I think, ob&s;erve to you that the&s;e deviations from the practice of the Antients may be rea&s;onably defended. For we were long &s;ince agreed, that where Love does not degenerate into epi&s;odical gallantry, but makes the foundation of the di&s;tre&s;s, it is, from the univer&s;ality of its influence, a pa&s;&s;ion very proper for Tragedy. And I have &s;een you too much moved at the repre&s;entation of &s;ome of our be&s;t Tragedies of private &s;tory, to believe you will con|demn me for making the other deviation.</P>

<P>I AM glad, you approve the method, I have taken, of &s;oftening the rigor of the old Drama. If I have, indeed, &s;oftened it &s;ufficiently for the modern ta&s;te, without parting with any of the e&s;&s;entials of the Greek method, I have obtained my purpo&s;e: which was to obviate &s;ome of the popular objections made to the antient form of Tragedy. For the cur|rent Opinion, you know, is, that by the &s;trict adhe|rence to the Unities, it re&s;trains the genius of the Poet; by the &s;implicity of its conduct, it dimini&s;hes the pathos of the fable; and, by the admi&s;&s;ion of a continued chorus, prevents that agreable embarra&s;s, which awakens our attention, and intere&s;ts our pa&s;|&s;ions.</P>
<P>The univer&s;al veneration, which we pay to the name of Shake&s;peare, at the &s;ame time that it has improved our reli&s;h for the higher beauties of Poetry, has un|doubtedly been the ground-work of all this fal&s;e criti|ci&s;m. That di&s;regard, which, in compliance merely with the ta&s;te of the times, he &s;hewed of all the ne|ce&s;&s;ary rules of the Drama, hath &s;ince been con&s;idered as a characteri&s;tic of his va&s;t and original genius; and con|&s;equently &s;et up as a model for &s;ucceding writers. Hence M. Voltaire remarks very ju&s;tly,
<Q>&startq;que le merite de cet auteur a perdu le Theatre Anglois. Le tems, qui &s;eul fait la reputation des hommes, rend &agrave; la &endq;fin leurs defauts re&s;pectables.</Q></P>
<P>Yet, notwith&s;tanding the ab&s;urdity of this low &s;u|per&s;tition, the notion is &s;o popular among&s;t Engli&s;h|men,
<PB N="296" REF="292">
that I fear it will never be entirely di&s;credited, till a poet ri&s;es up among&s;t us with a genius as eleva|ted and daring as Shake&s;peare's, and a judgment as &s;ober and cha&s;ti&s;ed as Racine's. But as it &s;eems too long to wait for this prodigy, it will not &s;urely be improper for any one of common talents, who would entertain the public without indulging its caprice, to take the be&s;t models of antiquity for his guides; and to adapt tho&s;e models, as near as may be, to the man|ners and ta&s;te of his own times. Unle&s;s he do both, he will, in effect, do nothing. For it cannot be doubted, that the many gro&s;s faults of our &s;tage are owing to the complai&s;ance and &s;ervility, with which the ordinary run of writers have ever humoured that illiterate, whim&s;ical, or corrupted age, in which it was their misfortune to be born.</P>
<P>Milton, you will tell me, is a noble exception to this ob&s;ervation. He is &s;o, and would have been a nobler, had he not run into the contrary extreme. The contempt in which, perhaps with ju&s;tice, he held the age he lived in, prevented him from conde&s;cend|ing either to amu&s;e or in&s;truct it. He had, before, given to his unworthy Countrymen the noble&s;t Poem that genius, conducted by antient art, could produce; and he had &s;een them receive it with di&s;regard, if not with di&s;like. Con&s;cious therefore of his own dignity, and of their demerit, he looked to po&s;terity, only for his reward, and to po&s;terity only directed his future labours. Hence it was perhaps, that he formed his SAMPSON AGONISTES on a model more &s;imple and &s;evere than Athens her&s;elf would have demanded; and took Ae&s;chylus for his ma&s;ter rather than So|phocles
<PB N="297" REF="293">
or Euripides: intending by this conduct to put as great a di&s;tance as po&s;&s;ible between him&s;elf and his contemporary writers; and to make his work (as he him&s;elf &s;aid) <HI>much different from what among&s;t them pa&s;&s;ed for the be&s;t</HI>. The &s;ucce&s;s of the Poem was, ac|cordingly, what one would have expected. The age, it appeared in, treated it with total neglect; neither hath that po&s;terity, to which he appealed, and which has done ju&s;tice to mo&s;t of his other writings, as yet given to this excellent piece its full mea&s;ure of po|pular and univer&s;al fame. Perhaps, in your clo&s;et, and that of a few more, who unaffectedly admire genuine nature and antient &s;implicity, the Agoni&s;tes may hold a di&s;tingui&s;hed rank. Yet, &s;urely, we can|not &s;ay (in Hamlet's phra&s;e) "<HI>that it plea&s;es the Mil|lion; it is &s;till Caviar to the general</HI>."</P>
<P>Hence, I think, I may conclude, that unle&s;s one would be content with a very late and very learned po&s;terity, Milton's conduct in this point &s;hould not be followed. A Writer of tragedy mu&s;t certainly adapt him&s;elf more to the general ta&s;te; becau&s;e the Dra|matic, of all kinds of Poetry, ought to be mo&s;t uni|ver&s;ally reli&s;hed and under&s;tood. The Lyric Mu&s;e addre&s;&s;es her&s;elf to the imagination of a reader; the Didactic to his judgment; but the Tragic &s;trikes di|rectly on his pa&s;&s;ions. Few men have a &s;trength of imagination capable of pur&s;uing the flights of Pin|dar; many have not a clearne&s;s of apprehen&s;ion &s;uited to the rea&s;onings of Lucretius and Pope: But every man has pa&s;&s;ions to be excited; and every man feels them excited by Shake&s;peare.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="294">But, though Tragedy be thus chiefly directed to the heart, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that it will &s;eldom attain its end without the concurrent approbation of the judgment. And to procure this, the artificial con|&s;truction of the fable goes a great way. In France, the excellence of their &s;everal poets is chiefly mea&s;ured by this &s;tandard. And among&s;t our own writers, if you except Shake&s;peare (who indeed ought, for his other virtues, to be exempt from common rules) you will find, that the mo&s;t regular of their compo&s;itions is generally reckoned their <HI>Chef d'oeuvre</HI>, witne&s;s the <HI>All for Love</HI> of Dryden, the <HI>Venice pre&s;erved</HI> of Ot|way, and the <HI>Jane Shore</HI> of Rowe.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;cheme, you propo&s;ed in your la&s;t, is I own practicable enough. Undoubtedly, mo&s;t part of the Dialogue of the Chorus might be put into the mouth of an Emma or Matilda, who, with &s;ome little &s;hew of &s;i&s;terly concernment, might be ea|&s;ily made to claim kindred with Earl Athelwold. Nay, by the addition of a few unnece&s;&s;ary inci|dents, which would co&s;t me no more than they are worth in contriving, and an unmeaning per&s;onage or two, who would be as little expence in creating, I believe I could quickly make the whole tolera|bly fit for an Engli&s;h Audience.</P>
<P>But for all this I cannot per&s;uade my&s;elf to en|ter upon the ta&s;k. I have, I know not how (like many of my betters) contracted a kind of
<PB N="299" REF="295">
veneration for the old Chorus; and am willing to think it e&s;&s;ential to the Tragic Drama. You &s;hall hear the rea&s;ons that incline me to this judgment. They re&s;pect the <HI>Poet</HI> and the <HI>Audience</HI>.</P>
<P>It is agreed, I think, on all hands, that in the conduct of a fable, the admi&s;&s;ion of a Chorus lays a nece&s;&s;ary re&s;traint on the <HI>Poet</HI>. The two Unities of time and place, are e&s;teemed by &s;ome of le&s;s con&s;equence in our modern Tragedy, than the third Unity of Action; but admit a Chorus, and you mu&s;t, of nece&s;&s;ity, re&s;tore them to tho&s;e equal rights, which they antiently enjoyed, and yet claim, by the Charter of Ari&s;totle. For the difference, which the u&s;e of the Chorus makes, is this: The modern Drama contents it&s;elf with a fact <HI>repre&s;ented</HI>; the antient requires it to be <HI>repre&s;ented before Spectators</HI>. Now as it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the&s;e Spectators &s;hould accompany the chief per&s;onages into private apartments, one &s;ingle Scene, or <HI>unity of Place</HI>, becomes &s;trictly nece&s;&s;ary. And as the&s;e Spectators are a&s;&s;embled on purpo&s;e to ob&s;erve and bear a part in the action, the <HI>time</HI> of that action becomes, of cour&s;e, that of the &s;pectacle or repre&s;entation it&s;elf; it being unrea&s;onable to make the Spectators attend &s;o long, as the Poet, in bring|ing about his Cata&s;trophe, may require. And this is u&s;ually the practice of the antient Stage. The mo|dern, on the contrary, regards very little the&s;e two capital re&s;traints; and its difu&s;e of the Chorus helps greatly to conceal the ab&s;urdity. For the Poet, with|out offending &s;o much again&s;t the laws of probabi|lity, may lead his per&s;onages from one part to ano|ther of the &s;ame palace or city, when they have only
<PB N="300" REF="296">
a paultry Servant or in&s;ignificant Confidant to attend them. He may think him&s;elf at liberty to &s;pend two or three days, months, or even years, in com|pleating his &s;tory; to clear the &s;tage at the end, or, if he plea&s;es, in the middle of every act: and, be|ing under no controul of the Chorus, he can break the continuity of the Drama, ju&s;t where he thinks it convenient; and, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a bri&s;k fugue and a good violin, can per&s;uade his audience, that as much time has elap&s;ed as his Hero's, or rather his own di&s;tre&s;s, may demand.</P>
<P>Hence it is, that &s;ecret intrigues become (as Mr. Dryden gravely calls them) the <HI>beauties of our modern Stage</HI>. Hence it is, that Incidents, and Bu&s;tle, and <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s</HI>, &s;upply the place of Simplicity, Nature, and Pathos: A happy change, perhaps, for the ge|nerality of writers, who might otherwi&s;e find it im|po&s;&s;ible to fill <HI>cette longue carriere de cinq actes</HI>, which a Writer, &s;ufficiently experienced in the&s;e matters, &s;ays, <HI>e&s;t &s;i prodigieu&s;ement difficile &agrave; remplir &s;ans E|pi&s;odes</HI>.</P>
<P>But, whatever the&s;e Play-makers may have gained by rejecting the Chorus, the true Poet has lo&s;t con|&s;iderably by it. For he has lo&s;t a graceful and natural re&s;ource to the embelli&s;hments of Pictu|re&s;que De&s;cription, &s;ublime allegory, and whatever el&s;e comes under the denomination of <HI>pure Poetry</HI>. Shake&s;peare, indeed, had the power of introducing this naturally, and, what is mo&s;t &s;trange, of joining it with <HI>pure Pa&s;&s;ion</HI>. But I make no doubt, if we had a Tragedy of his formed on the Greek model, we &s;hould find in it more frequent, if not nobler in|&s;tances
<PB N="301" REF="297">
of his high Poetical capacity, than in any &s;ingle compo&s;ition he has left us. I think you have a proof of this in tho&s;e parts of his hi&s;torical plays, which are called Chorus's, and written in the com|mon Dialogue metre. And your imagination will ea&s;ily conceive, how fine an ode the de&s;cription of the night preceding the battle of Agincourt, would have made in his hands; and what additional grace it would receive from that form of compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>With the means of introducing Poetry naturally is lo&s;t, al&s;o, the opportunity of conveying moral reflections with grace and propriety. But this comes more properly under con&s;ideration, when I give you my thoughts on the advantage the audience received from a well-conducted Chorus.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="4" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<P>IN my la&s;t I took no notice of that &s;uperior pomp and maje&s;ty, which the Chorus nece&s;&s;arily added to the &s;cene of the Drama. I made no remarks on the agreable variety it introduced into the ver&s;ifi|cation and metre; nor &s;hewed how, by uniting the harmony of the Lyre to the pomp of the Bu&s;kin, mu&s;ic became intimately connected with it, and fur|ni&s;hed it with all its additional graces. The&s;e and many other advantages I might have in&s;i&s;ted upon, had I thought them &s;o material as the two I men|tioned; the latter of which, namely, its being a pro|per vehicle for moral and &s;entiment, is &s;o material,
<PB N="302" REF="298">
that I think nothing can po&s;&s;ibly atone for the lo&s;s of it.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e parts of the Drama, where the judgment of a mixt audience is mo&s;t liable to be mi&s;led by what pa&s;&s;es before its view, the chief actors are ge|nerally too much agitated by the furious pa&s;&s;ions, or too much attached by the tender ones, to think coolly, and impre&s;s on the &s;pectators a moral &s;enti|ment properly. A Confidant or Servant has &s;eldom &s;en&s;e enough to do it, never dignity enough to make it regarded. In&s;tead therefore of the&s;e, the Antients were provided with a band of di&s;tingui&s;hed per&s;ons, not merely capable of &s;eeing and hearing, but of arguing, advi&s;ing, and reflecting; from the leader of which a moral &s;entiment never came unnaturally, but &s;uitably and gracefully; and from the troop it|&s;elf, a poetical flow of tender commi&s;eration, of reli|gious &s;upplication, or of virtuous triumph, was ever ready to heighten the pathos, to in&s;pire a reverential awe of the Deity, and to advance the cau&s;e of <HI>hone&s;ty</HI> and of truth.</P>
<P>If you a&s;k me, how it augmented the pathetic, I cannot give you a better an&s;wer than the <HI>Abb&eacute; Vatry</HI> has done in his di&s;&s;ertation on the &s;ubject, publi&s;hed in the <HI>Memoirs de l'Acad. des In&s;er. &amp;c.</HI>
<Q>&startq;It ef|fected this (&s;ays he) both in its <HI>odes</HI> and <HI>dialogue</HI>. The wonderful power of Mu&s;ic and the Dance is univer&s;ally allowed. And, as the&s;e were always <HI>accompaniments</HI> to the Odes, there is no doubt but they contributed greatly to move the pa&s;&s;ions. It was nece&s;&s;ary that there &s;hould be odes or intermedes, but it was al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary, that the&s;e
<PB N="303" REF="299">
intermedes &s;hould not &s;uffer the minds of the Au|dience to cool, but, on the contrary, &s;hould &s;up|port and fortify tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which the previous &s;cenes had already excited. Nothing imaginable could produce this effect better, than the choral &s;ongs and dances, which filled the mind with ideas corre&s;ponding to the &s;ubject, and never failed to add new force to the &s;entiments of the principal per&s;onages. In the Dialogue al&s;o, the Chorus &s;erved to move the pa&s;&s;ions, by &s;hewing to the &s;pectators other &s;pectators &s;trongly affected by the action. A &s;pectacle of &s;uch a kind as is fitted to excite in us the pa&s;&s;ions of <HI>Terror</HI>, and <HI>Pity</HI>, will not of it&s;elf &s;o &s;trongly affect us, as when we &s;ee others, al&s;o, affected by it. The paint|ers have generally under&s;tood this &s;ecret, and have had recour&s;e to an expedient, &s;imilar to that of the Chorus of the poets. Not content with the &s;imple repre&s;entation of an hi&s;torical event, they have al&s;o added groups of a&s;&s;i&s;tant figures, and expre&s;t in their faces the different pa&s;&s;ions, they would have their picture excite. Nay they &s;ometimes inli&s;t into their &s;ervice even irrational animals. In the <HI>&s;laughter of the Innocents</HI>, le Brun was not &s;atisfied with expre&s;&s;ing all the hor|ror, of which the &s;ubject is naturally capable, he has al&s;o painted two hor&s;es with their hair &s;tanding on end, and &s;tarting back, as afraid to trample upon the bleeding infants. This is an artifice which has often been employed, and which has always &s;ucceeded. A good poet &s;hould do the &s;ame; and Iphigenia &s;hould not be &s;uf|fered
<PB N="304" REF="300">
to appear on the Theatre, without being accompanied with per&s;ons capable of feeling her &endq;misfortunes.</Q></P>
<P>Had this ingenious Abb&eacute; &s;een the famous Belli|&s;arius of Vandyke, I am apt to believe he would have thought it a much more noble illu&s;tration of the matter. The Soldier in that piece, though &s;o much condemned by our modern Profe&s;&s;ors of <HI>Vert&ucirc;</HI> for being, as they &s;ay, the principal Figure, is the very thing which rai&s;es this picture from a &s;imple Portrait (which it mu&s;t otherwi&s;e have been) to the fine&s;t moral painting; and in Greece would have placed the painter among&s;t that cla&s;s of Arti&s;ts, which they e&s;teemed the noble&s;t, the &EEgr;&THgr;&Ogr;&Ggr;&Rgr;&Agr;&PHgr;&Ogr;&Igr;. The greate&s;t Tragic Poet could not have rai&s;ed a more exqui&s;ite di&s;tre&s;s than this judicious painter has done by the attitude of that Soldier; as well as by the &s;ubordinate figures, which, with great propriety, are female ones; nothing being &s;o likely to rai&s;e in a military mind that mixture of pity and di&s;dain, which he wanted to expre&s;s, as to &s;ee &s;uch a hero relieved by charity, and that too the charity of girls and old women.</P>
<P>But, returning to my &s;ubject, I will ju&s;t ob&s;erve to you, that if it be proper to a&s;&s;i&s;t an audience in reli&s;hing the pathetic, by &s;hewing an imitation of that pathos in the Chorus, it is much more &s;o to in&s;truct them how to be affected properly, with the characters and actions which are repre&s;ented in the cour&s;e of the Drama. The character of PIERRE in <HI>Venice pre&s;erved</HI>, when left entirely to the judg|ment of the audience, is perhaps one of the mo&s;t
<PB N="305" REF="301">
improper for public view, that ever was produced on any &s;tage. It is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible, but &s;ome part of the &s;pectators &s;hould go from the repre&s;entation with very fal&s;e and immoral impre&s;&s;ions. But had the Tragedy been written on the antient plan; had Pierre's character been drawn ju&s;t as it is, and &s;ome few alterations made in Jaffier's, I know no two characters more capable of doing &s;ervice in a mo|ral view, when ju&s;tly animadverted upon by the Cho|rus. I don't &s;ay, I would have tru&s;ted Otway with the writing of it.</P>
<P>To have done, and to relea&s;e you. Bad characters become on this plan as harmle&s;s in the hands of the Poet, as the Hi&s;torian; and good ones become infi|nitely more u&s;eful, by how much the Poetic is more forcible than the Hi&s;torical mode of in&s;truction.</P>

<P>THE rea&s;on, why in a former Letter you ad|vi&s;ed me to alter the Chorus, is made very apparent in your la&s;t. For, by per&s;uading me to get the Odes &s;et to mu&s;ic, and to ri&s;k the Play on the &s;tage, I under&s;tand only that you are willing, any how, to make it a more profitable work for me, than it can po&s;&s;ibly be by means of the pre&s;s alone.</P>
<P>Yet certainly, Sir, one &s;ingle reflection on our Bri|ti&s;h pit will make you change your &s;entiments ef|fectually. Think only on the trial made by M. Ra|cine, in a nation much before ours, in a ta&s;te for pro|bability and decorum in Theatrical diver&s;ions. In his
<PB N="306" REF="302">
two la&s;t Tragedies, you know, he has fully &s;ucceeded in the very thing I aimed at; and has adapted a noble imitation of antient &s;implicity to the ta&s;te of his own times: particularly in his <HI>Athalia</HI>, a poem in which the mo&s;t &s;uperb and augu&s;t &s;pectacle, the mo&s;t inte|re&s;ting event, and the mo&s;t &s;ublime flow of in&s;pired Poetry, are all nobly and naturally united. Yet I am told, that neither that, nor the <HI>E&s;ther</HI>, retains its Chorus, when repre&s;ented on the French Theatre.</P>
<P>To what is this owing? To the refinement mo&s;t cer|tainly of our modern mu&s;ic. This art is now carried to &s;uch a pitch of perfection, or if you will of corruption, which makes it utterly incapable of being an adjunct to Poetry. <HI>Il y a grand apparence, que les progr&egrave;s que vous avez faits dans la mu&s;ique, ont nui enfin &agrave; ceux de la veri|table Tragedie. C'e&s;t un talent, qui a fait tort &agrave; un autre</HI>; &s;ays M. Voltaire with his u&s;ual ta&s;te and judgment. Our different cadences, our divi&s;ions, variations, re|petitions, without which modern mu&s;ic cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t, are entirely improper for the expre&s;&s;ion of poetry, and were &s;carce known to the Antients.</P>
<P>But could this be managed, the additional ex|pence nece&s;&s;arily attendant on &s;uch a performance, would make the matter impracticable. This Mr. Dryden fore&s;aw long ago. The pa&s;&s;age is curious.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;A new Theatre, much more ample and much deeper, mu&s;t be made for that purpo&s;e; be&s;ides the co&s;t of &s;ometimes forty or fifty habits: which is an expence too large to be &s;upplied by a compa|ny of actors. It is true, I &s;hould not be &s;orry to &s;ee a <HI>Chorus</HI> on a Theatre, more than as large and as deep again as ours; built and adorned at a
<PB N="307" REF="303">
King's charges; and on that condition, and another, which is, that my hands were not bound behind me, as now they are, I &s;hould not de&s;pair of mak|ing &s;uch <HI>a Tragedy</HI> as might be both <HI>in&s;tructive</HI> and &endq;<HI>delightful</HI> according to the <HI>manner</HI> of the Grecians.</Q>
What he means by having <HI>his hands bound</HI>, I imagine, is, that he was either engaged to his &s;ub&s;cribers for a Tran&s;lation of Virgil, or to the manager of the Thea|tre for &s;o many plays a &s;ea&s;on. This &s;uffrage of Mr. Dryden is, however, very appo&s;ite to the pre&s;ent point. It &s;erves, al&s;o, to vindicate my de&s;ign of imitating the Greek Drama. For if he, who was &s;o prejudiced to the modern &s;tage, as to think intrigue a capital beauty in it; if he, I &s;ay, owns that the grand &s;ecret <HI>prode&s;&s;e et delectare</HI> was the characteri&s;tic of the Greek Drama only, nothing can better ju&s;tify my pre&s;ent attempt than the approbation he gives to it in this pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>Having now &s;ettled with you all matters of general critici&s;m, I hope in your next you will give me your objections to <HI>&s;cenes, &s;peeches, images</HI>, &amp;c. And be a&s;&s;ured I &s;hall treat your judgment in the&s;e matters with greater deference, than I have done in what re|lated to the Stage and the Chorus.</P>

<P>* The above quotations, from antient authors, are here thrown together, in order to &s;upport and explain &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in the Drama of CARACTACUS, that re&s;pect the manners of the Druids; and which, the general account of their cu&s;toms, to be found in our hi&s;tories of Britain, does not include.</P>

<P>In the minute de&s;cription which Pliny gives us of the ceremony of gathering the mi&s;letoe, he tells us, they &s;acrificed two white bulls. See Pliny's Natural Hi&s;tory, l. xvi. c. 44. which Drayton, in his Po|lyolbion, thus ver&s;ifies.</P>

<P>The ovum anguinum, or &s;erpent's egg; a famous Druidical amulet, thus circum&s;tantially de&s;cribed by Pliny.&mdash;Praeterea e&s;t ovorum genus in magna Gal|liarum fama, omi&s;&s;um Graecis. Angues innumeri ae&s;tate convoluti, &s;alivis faucium corporumque &s;pumis artifici complexu glomerantur; Anguinum appellatur.

<P>There are remains of this &s;uper&s;tition &s;till, both in the northern and we&s;tern parts of our i&s;land. For Lhwyd, the author of the Archeologia, writes thus to Rowland; &s;ee Mona Antiqua, p. 338.
<Q>&startq;The Druid doctrine about the <HI>Glain Neidr</HI>, obtains very much through all Scotland, as well lowlands as highlands; but there is not a word of it in this kingdom (Ireland);
<PB N="314" REF="308">
where, as there are no &s;nakes, they could not pro|pagate it. Be&s;ides &s;nake-&s;tones, the highlanders have their &s;nail-&s;tones, paddock-&s;tones, &amp;c. to all which they attribute their &s;everal virtues, and wear &endq;them as amulets.</Q>
And in another letter he writes,
<Q>&startq;The Corni&s;h retain variety of charms, and have &s;till, towards the land's end, the amulet of Maen Magal, and Glain Neidr, which latter they call a Milpreu, or Melpreu, and have a charm for the &s;nake to make it, when they have found one a&s;leep, and &endq;&s;truck a hazel wand in the center of her &s;pires.</Q></P>

<P>The few and imperfect accounts antiquity gives us of ceremonies, &amp;c which are unque&s;tionably Druidi|cal, makes it nece&s;&s;ary in this, and in other places of the Drama, to have recour&s;e to Tacitus's account of the Germans, among&s;t whom, if there were really no e&s;tabli&s;hed Druids, there was certainly a great corre|&s;pondency, in religious opinions, with the Gauls and Britons. The pa&s;&s;age here alluded to is taken from his 10th chapter. Proprium gentis, equorumque quo|que prae&s;agia ac monitus experiri. Publice aluntur ii&s;dem nemoribus ac lucis, candidi &amp; nullo mortali opere contacti, quos pre&s;&s;os &s;acro curru, &s;acerdos ac rex, vel princeps civitatis comitantur, hinnitus &amp; fre|mitus ob&s;ervant, nec ulli au&s;picio major fides non &s;o|lum apud plebem, &s;ed apud proceres, apud &s;acerdotes.</P>

<P>This is meant to de&s;cribe the rocking-&s;tone, of which there are &s;everal &s;till to be &s;een in Wales, Corn|wall, and Derby&s;hire. They are univer&s;ally &s;uppo&s;ed, by antiquarians, to be Druid monuments; and Mr. Toland thinks,
<Q>&startq;that the Druids made the people be|lieve that they only could move them, and that by a miracle, by which they condemned or acquitted the accu&s;ed, and often brought criminals to confe&s;s &endq;what could in no other way be extorted from them.</Q>
It was this conjecture which gave the hint for this piece of machinery. The reader may find a de&s;cription of one of the&s;e rocking-&s;tones in Camden's Britannia, in his account of Pembroke&s;hire; and al&s;o &s;everal in Bor|la&s;e's hi&s;tory of Cornwall.</P>

<P>This account is taken from what hi&s;tory tells us did really happen &s;ome years after, when the groves of Mona were de&s;troyed by Suetonius Paulinus. Igitur Monam in&s;ulam incolis validam, &amp; receptaculum per|fugarum aggredi parat, nave&s;que fabricatur plano alveo, adver&s;us breve litus &amp; incertum. Sic Pedes; equites vado &s;ecuti, aut altiores inter undas, adnantes equis tran&s;mi&s;ere.

<P>The Druids did not really wor&s;hip the divinity under any &s;ymbol. But this is put intentionally into the mouth of the Roman, as mi&s;taking the rude &s;tones placed round the grove, for idols. Thus Lucan in his beautiful de&s;cription of a Druid grove,
