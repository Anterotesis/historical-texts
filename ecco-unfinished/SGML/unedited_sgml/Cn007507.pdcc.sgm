<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>A</HI> Generous Nature &s;uffers no Misfortune el&s;e, with &s;uch &s;evere <HI>Reluctance,</HI> as ari&s;es from an Obligation to pur&s;ue the little Arts of <HI>Flattery,</HI> which <HI>Cu&s;tom,</HI> now-adays, has render'd <HI>nece&s;|&s;ary,</HI> in Addre&s;&s;es to the <HI>Powerful</HI>.</P>
<P>I, therefore, who have no Reli&s;h for <HI>Ambition;</HI> who neither court, nor <HI>wou'd</HI> enjoy, the Pomp of Grandeur; and who, amid&s;t the gaudie&s;t Attributes of Power, &s;ee nothing, worth my <HI>Envy,</HI> or my <HI>Wi&s;hes,</HI> but the &s;till-neglected Means of making <HI>Merit,</HI> happy, and di&s;tingui&s;hable; I, who have no Views, in Writings of this Nature, but the Plea&s;ure they afford me, can, with ea&s;e, pa&s;s by the Great in <HI>Title,</HI> and addre&s;s my Application to the Great in <HI>Knowledge:</HI> Men, who, through the Gloom of Fortune's <HI>Shade,</HI> &s;hine out, to the impartial Eye, with native Lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>I chu&s;e out <HI>you,</HI> among the Kindred of the Mu&s;es, as you are their <HI>genuine</HI> Offspring: Men, who wou'd teach the World the Force of <HI>Rea&s;on;</HI> and give <HI>Plea&s;ure,</HI> only to in&s;inuate <HI>In&s;truction</HI>: Who wou'd &s;upport the Antient Dignity of your Profe&s;&s;ion; and behold, with <HI>Scorn,</HI> the <HI>Pro&s;titution</HI> of an Art, de&s;ign'd for <HI>Great,</HI> and <HI>Godlike</HI> &V;&s;es.</P>
<P>To know you for &s;evere, and watchful <HI>Criticks,</HI> does not fright <HI>me</HI> from acknowledging your Worth. I &s;ee, and own, the Great, the Noble <HI>U&s;efulne&s;s</HI> of your Profe&s;&s;ion. Why has not the <HI>blind</HI> Godde&s;s thrown your <HI>Lots,</HI> as high, above the <HI>Grovellers</HI> of <HI>Par|na&s;&s;us,</HI>
<PB N="vi" REF="4">
as we confe&s;s your <HI>Under&s;tandings?</HI> In &s;pite of all the little, empty Differences, Forms, and Circum&s;tances, of <HI>Condition,</HI> I look, with Plea&s;ure, over Crouds of <HI>Titles,</HI> up to your Perfections; and behold you plac'd, even <HI>now,</HI> where length of <HI>Time,</HI> and just <HI>Po&s;terity,</HI> &s;hall fix your <HI>Memories</HI>.</P>
<P>You therefore, who are able to do Ju&s;tice, both ways, who can di&s;tingui&s;h <HI>Excellencies,</HI> and detect <HI>Ab&s;urdity;</HI> You be&s;t <HI>de&s;erve</HI> the Labour of the <HI>Mu&s;es:</HI> And, to <HI>you,</HI> and <HI>not</HI> your <HI>Patrons,</HI> I a&s;cri$e this Tragedy.</P>
<P>There is, I find, a great Misfortune, which attends the Repre|&s;entation of a Play, who&s;e <HI>Plot</HI> has any ju&s;t Connexion, or <HI>Depen|dency</HI> of <HI>Scene</HI>. Our general Audiences con&s;i&s;t of Men, who&s;e Heads are bent a very different Way from what is nece&s;&s;ary for a <HI>Ta&s;te</HI> of <HI>Poetry</HI>. And, being never <HI>moved</HI> by the affected, vi|cious, and unnatural <HI>Tone</HI> of <HI>Voice,</HI> &s;o common, on our Stages; They &s;ink in&s;en&s;ibly, from that <HI>Attention,</HI> into which <HI>judicious</HI> Actors forcibly attract us; And, by that Means, lo&s;e the <HI>Thread</HI> of the De&s;ign: and, con&s;equently, all the <HI>Reli&s;h</HI> of the Entertain|ment.</P>
<P>I need not tell you, that, without Attention, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for any Play to <HI>&s;trike</HI>. Now, where it does not <HI>&s;trike,</HI> 'tis as impo&s;|&s;ible to <HI>plea&s;e</HI>: And, if it does not <HI>plea&s;e,</HI> it never can <HI>in&s;truct</HI>. So, here, we find the very <HI>End</HI> of all <HI>Dramatic</HI> Poetry <HI>de&s;troyed,</HI> by that one fundamental <HI>Evil</HI> of a Players <HI>Ignorance</HI>. I might, more ju&s;tly, call it <HI>Ob&s;tinacy</HI>. They cannot, if they think at all, but know what is <HI>Natural,</HI> from what is <HI>Mon&s;trous</HI>: But they are &s;o accu&s;tom'd to a horrible, <HI>Theatric,</HI> way of &s;peaking, that, ex|cept in Mr. <HI>Booth,</HI> who is, indeed, a ju&s;t and excellent Trage|dian, you &s;hall never $ear &s;o much as an Endeavour, at tho&s;e thril|ling <HI>Breaks,</HI> and <HI>Changes</HI> of the <HI>Voice;</HI> the only po&s;&s;ible Ex|pre&s;&s;ion of our Pa&s;&s;ions, in their Variations and Degrees, and, which &s;o &s;en&s;ibly alarm the Soul, and challenge the <HI>Attention</HI> of an Audience. If <HI>Grief,</HI> which claims a <HI>low,</HI> and <HI>broken</HI> Voice, is
<PB N="vii" REF="5">
utter'd in the Thunder of a <HI>Rant,</HI> what Mark has <HI>Rage</HI> to be di|&s;tingui&s;hed by? Our Actors &s;hou'd indu&s;triou&s;ly forget <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> and the <HI>Spectators;</HI> and put on the <HI>Nature,</HI> with the <HI>Dre&s;s,</HI> of every Character they repre&s;ent. They &s;hou'd not <HI>act,</HI> but really <HI>be,</HI> the <HI>happy,</HI> or the <HI>wretched,</HI> which we are to think 'em.</P>
<P>You will &s;ay, a <HI>perfect Actor</HI> is a Wonder, we mu&s;t rather <HI>wi&s;h,</HI> than <HI>hope</HI> for: But, to &s;hew, by what we <HI>have,</HI> what 'tis, we &s;hou'd <HI>de&s;ire,</HI> he mu&s;t, at once, be furni&s;hed, with the &s;everal Ex|cellences following. The Face, and Stature, and no more, of Mr. <HI>Leigh,</HI> at the <HI>New</HI> Hou&s;e. The genteel Turn, and Softne&s;s of Addre&s;s, of Mr. <HI>Wilks,</HI> together with his brisk, and lively Spirit. The Maje&s;ty of Mr. <HI>Keene</HI>. The A&s;&s;urance of Mr. <HI>Cib|ber</HI>. And, to crown all the&s;e, Mr. <HI>Booth</HI>'s &s;weet <HI>Voice,</HI> ju&s;t <HI>Accent,</HI> and <HI>Solemnity</HI> of &V;tterance: And add to <HI>all,</HI> a Frequen|cy, and Aptne&s;s, of expre&s;&s;ive <HI>Ge&s;ture</HI>: with a Vi&s;age, capable of putting on at Will, the Lines, and Marks of every Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>As I am writing to &s;uch perfect Judges of the <HI>Drama,</HI> I look upon my &s;elf oblig'd to tell you, that I have endeavour'd to ob&s;erve the <HI>Rules,</HI> with all the nece&s;&s;ary <HI>&s;trictne&s;s</HI>. And yet, at the &s;ame Time, indulge the Common Ta&s;te, for <HI>Fullne&s;s</HI> of <HI>De&s;ign;</HI> and <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> as our Players call it.</P>
<P>This <HI>New</HI> E&s;&s;ay to reconcile the <HI>Antient,</HI> and the <HI>Modern</HI> Plans of Tragedy (the first Endeavour of the Kind) may, po&s;&s;ibly de|&s;erve Improvement, from &s;ome future Imitator. Tho' I wou'd not, with the famous Mr. <HI>Bays,</HI> affirm the <HI>End,</HI> and &s;ole De&s;ign of Tragic Writing, to be, as he expre&s;&s;es it, to <HI>Elevate</HI> and <HI>Surprize,</HI> yet I will offer it to your Deci&s;ion, whether <HI>Admiration,</HI> tho' mo&s;t pro|perly the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the <HI>Epic</HI> Poem, may not merit to be added as a <HI>Third Requi&s;ite,</HI> to the Pre&s;ent <HI>Movers</HI> of the Tragic Mu&s;e, which, &s;peaking &s;trictly, &s;tands confin'd to Terror, and Compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I wou'd not, here, he under&s;tood to mean, that <HI>barren</HI> Kind of <HI>Admiration,</HI> which ari&s;es from Perplexity of <HI>Plot,</HI> producd from
<PB N="viii" REF="6">
huddled Heaps of Incidents, not naturally <HI>bringing on,</HI> and <HI>fol|lowing</HI> each other; but that juster Pa&s;&s;ion, which we feel, from a Reflection on the strange <HI>Degrees,</HI> and various <HI>Means,</HI> whereby the <HI>Vices</HI> we correct in Tragedy, <HI>draw down</HI> upon a guilty Head, the very Ills, and Mi&s;eries, they were committed to <HI>avoid</HI>.</P>
<P>As this new Specimen of Tragedy is built, perhaps, upon the mo&s;t Variety of Turns, and has a deeper and a more &s;urprizing Plot, than any Play which has been publi&s;h'd, that I know of, in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue; and yet is written with a &s;trict Ob&s;ervance of <HI>Dramatic Rule:</HI> And &s;ince it will appear, that notwith&s;tanding this Re&s;pect which I have paid the <HI>Laws</HI> of <HI>Poetry,</HI> I have found room for <HI>Topical</HI> Reflection, large <HI>De&s;cription, Love, War, Show,</HI> and <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion:</HI> So I would, at lea&s;t, propo&s;e it to the Enemies of <HI>Criti|ci&s;m,</HI> as a Proof (however otherwi&s;e imperfect) that <HI>Order</HI> does not, as they frequently object, confine the Ranges of a Poet's Fancy: But may, on the contrary, collect, make apt, and add to the delight of all tho&s;e &s;catter'd <HI>random Beauties,</HI> which our <HI>Tragic Libertines</HI> have been &s;o fond of.</P>
<P>The <HI>Moral</HI> I &s;ate down to write upon was, to expo&s;e the dange|rous Con&s;equences of our giving way to <HI>Rage,</HI> and Ra&s;hne&s;s of Deter|mination: Teaching, thence, how nece&s;&s;ary 'tis, to hold a &s;teddy Rein upon our Pa&s;&s;ions; and con&s;ent to no <HI>fir&s;t Ill,</HI> tho' with intent to guard again&s;t a threatening <HI>Greater</HI>.</P>
<P>That I might be at Liberty to form the proper <HI>Incidents</HI> with le&s;s Confinment to my Fancy, I re&s;olved to chu&s;e no noted Character of <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI>. Our di&s;tance <HI>from,</HI> and dark Ideas <HI>of,</HI> the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Nation, and her Borders, tempted me to fix my Scene in &s;o <HI>remote</HI> a Situation. The <HI>Fable</HI> is fictitious; and the Characters are all imaginary, even to the very Names, excepting only <HI>Uncham,</HI> com|mon to the Emperors of <HI>China,</HI> as at <HI>Rome,</HI> the <HI>Cae&s;ars</HI>. The <HI>Manners,</HI> and the <HI>Sentiments,</HI> are <HI>proper,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> to produce the &s;everal <HI>Ends,</HI> which form the Bu&s;ine&s;s of each Character. The <HI>Language</HI> is not labour'd, nor too low,: But &s;uch as I conceive
<PB N="ix" REF="7">
might rea&s;onably be expected, from the Per&s;ons we &s;uppo&s;e to <HI>utter</HI> it. The common <HI>Tin&s;el</HI>-Ware, of <HI>Simile</HI> and <HI>Metaphor,</HI> I have little dealt in, unle&s;s when I attempt <HI>De&s;cription:</HI> There, you know, they are not only <HI>natural,</HI> but <HI>requi&s;ite</HI>. As to the De&s;crip|tions them&s;elves, tho' very frequent in this Tragedy, you will not think they are too many, if you find, they are well touch'd, and in|troduced &s;o <HI>aptly,</HI> as to be <HI>nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> as well as <HI>ornamental,</HI> to the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Play.</P>
<P>The <HI>Decoration,</HI> which, however &s;lighted, or ill-under&s;tood, among us, is a <HI>fifth E&s;&s;ential:</HI> And without it, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible but that the fine&s;t Tragedy mu&s;t be <HI>maim'd,</HI> and strain on <HI>Probability,</HI> to this I paid a very great regard, in the Contrivance of the Play: And all the <HI>Dre&s;&s;es</HI> and the <HI>Scenes,</HI> were <HI>new:</HI> And &s;uch, who &s;aw 'em, in the Repre&s;entation, will confe&s;s them <HI>not unplea&s;ing,</HI> and extreme|ly differing from any thing which has been lately &s;een upon the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Stages.</P>
<P>The <HI>Unities</HI> I have pre&s;erv'd unbroken, every where. The <HI>Action</HI> you will find is <HI>&s;ingle</HI> and <HI>entire</HI>. The <HI>Place</HI> confin'd to <HI>one</HI> Town only; And the <HI>Time</HI> within the compa&s;s of a <HI>natural Day,</HI> even at the utmo&s;t.</P>
<P>I will enlarge on nothing further, but to wi&s;h, That as on <HI>Tue&s;|day next,</HI> the <HI>6</HI>th of <HI>March,</HI> they act <HI>this Tragedy</HI> for Mrs. <HI>Ro|ger</HI>'s <HI>Benefit;</HI> who does &s;o well and &s;o agreeably perform a chief Part in it; the <HI>Readers</HI> of <HI>both Sexes,</HI> into who&s;e Hands, before that Day, the Play &s;hall fall, would give them&s;elves the Plea&s;ure to ob|&s;erve, with what a graceful Ea&s;ine&s;s &s;he enters into the true <HI>mean|ing</HI> of her Character; and pay her the <HI>Applau&s;es,</HI> which her great Experience of the Stage, and artful Application to its Bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;o ju&s;tly merit, from a knowing Audience.</P>
