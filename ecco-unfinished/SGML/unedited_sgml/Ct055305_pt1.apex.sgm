<HEAD>TO THE PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>IF the author of the Complete Hi&s;tory of England may be allowed to judge from the extraordinary demand for his work, and the &s;entiments of many per&s;ons, for who&s;e opinions he has the utmo&s;t deference, this addition will be favourably received, and in|deed required by his readers, as a completion of the original plan.</P>
<P>In this ta&s;k he has engaged with the greater alacrity, as the &s;ubject teems with incidents and events which the hi&s;torian can record with plea&s;ure, and the reader peru&s;e with pe|culiar &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>The latter part of what has been offered to the public exhibits an unplea&s;ing ti&s;&s;ue of mi&s;|conduct and mi&s;carriage; at home, an ad|mini&s;tration without vigour; abroad, a war without &s;ucce&s;s: in a word, a people groan|ing under the double pre&s;&s;ure of internal di&s;|content and external di&s;honour. In the period that remains to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, the &s;cene is agreeably changed, and pre&s;ents &s;uch a for|tunate a&s;&s;emblage of objects as never occur|red in any other aera of Engli&s;h hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The views of the crown are at length re|conciled to the de&s;ires of the people. We

&s;ee, for the fir&s;t time, a mini&s;ter in full po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of popularity, requiring infinitely greater &s;ub&s;idies than ever were exacted under any former reign, &s;ince the beginning of the mo|narchy; and the &s;ubjects paying them with chearfulne&s;s, becau&s;e they confide in the inte|grity of the admini&s;tration, and know tho&s;e liberal aids will be expended for the honour and advantage of the commonwealth. We have al&s;o lived to &s;ee the fallacy of a perni|cious and &s;purious maxim, adopted by &s;ome late mini&s;ters, that the machine of govern|ment could not be properly moved, unle&s;s the wheels were &s;meared with corruption.</P>
<P>Our military operations are now planned with &s;o much wi&s;dom and &s;agacity, and exe|cuted with &s;uch &s;pirit, as revive the lu&s;tre of pa&s;t ages; and the glory of our late conque&s;ts even rivals the renown of tho&s;e heroic at|chievements which dignify and adorn the an|cient annals of Great Britain. We behold valour tutored by conduct, &s;entiment united with courage, and the godlike virtues of hu|manity &s;hining in the mid&s;t of &s;laughter and de&s;olation. What is &s;till more extraordinary, and above all other circum&s;tances redounds to the honour of our national councils, we feel none of tho&s;e rude tempe&s;ts that are rai&s;ed by the furious breath of war. Notwith&s;tand|ing all the ho&s;tile efforts of the&punc; mo&s;t formi|dable enemy, which Di&s;cord could have
<PB N="v" REF="50">
armed again&s;t this i&s;land, we enjoy the ble&s;&s;|ings of &s;ecurity and repo&s;e&punc; as if we were hedged around by &s;ome Divinity; and our commerce flouri&s;hes undi&s;turbed as in the bo&s;om of peace.</P>
<P>Themes like the&s;e cannot fail to warm the heart, and animate the pen of the hi&s;torian&punc; who glows with the love of his country. Yet he will carefully avoid the imputation of en|thu&s;ia&s;m. In the mid&s;t of his tran&s;ports he hopes to remember his duty, and check the exuberance of zeal with the rigid &s;everity of hi&s;torical truth.</P>
<P>This is the guiding &s;tar by which he hath hitherto &s;teered his dangerous cour&s;e; the &s;tar who&s;e chearing radiance has conducted him &s;afe through the rocks of prejudice and the tides of faction. Guiltle&s;s of all connexions that might be &s;uppo&s;ed to affect his candour&punc; and endanger his integrity, he is determined to proceed with that fearle&s;s &s;pirit of inde|pendence, by which he flatters him&s;elf the former part of the work hath been remark|ably di&s;tingui&s;hed. Equally incapable of &s;er|vile complai&s;ance to power, and implicit at|tachment to particular &s;y&s;tems, he will prai&s;e without re&s;erve, and blame without appre|hen&s;ion, as often as virtue merits his applau&s;e or vice provokes his cen&s;ure; and the reader &s;hall have no ju&s;t cau&s;e to tax him with having concealed any important blemi&s;h or
<PB N="vi" REF="60">
defect even in the mo&s;t &s;hining character, &s;o far as it falls within the province of hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>He takes this opportunity of expre&s;&s;ing his warme&s;t acknowledgments to tho&s;e gentle|men who have contributed their advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance towards the execution of this de|&s;ign; and as he is provided with authentic materials for that purpo&s;e, he doubts not but that he &s;hall be able to pre&s;erve the favour of the public, which he &s;hall always a&s;&s;idu|ou&s;ly cultivate, in pre&s;enting it with the &s;equel of a work, which hath &s;urmounted every &s;pecies of oppo&s;ition, and acquired &s;ome degree of credit, though unowned by patronage, and un&s;u&s;tained by party.</P>
<P>N. B. As many anonymous writers have been hired to abu&s;e this work in printed papers and pamphlets, the author takes this opportunity of declaring, that if any per&s;on of character in the Republic of Letters &s;hall think proper to cen&s;ure this hi&s;tory in print, and &s;et his name to his animadver&s;ions, he (the author) will an&s;wer them to the be&s;t of his power; but it cannot be expected that he &s;hould employ his time in di&s;puting with ob&s;cure, mercenary, and de&s;perate &s;cribblers, who en|li&s;t them&s;elves under the banners of malicious intere&s;ted calumny, and may be &s;aid to &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon the wages of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748. Reflec|tions on thepeace.</NOTE> THE peace of Aix-la&punc;Chapelle, however un&s;table or inglorious it might appear to tho&s;e few who under&s;tood the intere&s;ts, and felt for the honour of their country, was neverthele&s;s not unwelcome to the nation in general. The Bri|ti&s;h mini&s;try will always find it more difficult to &s;atisfy the people at the end of a &s;ucce&s;sful cam|paign, than at the conclu&s;ion of an unfortunate war. The Engli&s;h are impatient of mi&s;carriage and di&s;appointment, and too apt to be intoxicated with victory. At this period they were tired of the burthens, and &s;ick of the di&s;graces, to which they had been expo&s;ed in the cour&s;e of &s;even tedious campaigns. They had &s;uffered con&s;iderable lo&s;&s;es and interruption in the article of commerce, which was the &s;ource of their national opulence and power&punc; they knew it would of nece&s;&s;ity be clogged with
<PB N="8" REF="80">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> additional duties, for the maintenance of a con|tinental war, and the &s;upport of foreign &s;ub&s;idia|ries; and they drew very faint pre&s;ages of future &s;ucce&s;s either from the conduct of their allies, or the capacity of their commanders.</P>
<P>To a people influenced by the&s;e con&s;iderations, the re&s;toration of a free trade, the re&s;pite from that anxiety and &s;u&s;pence which the pro&s;ecution of a war never fails to engender, and the pro&s;pect of &s;peedy deliverance from di&s;couraging re&s;traint and op|pre&s;&s;ive impo&s;itions, were advantages that &s;weet|ened the bitter draught of a di&s;honourable treaty, and induced the majority of the nation to acquie&s;ce in the peace, not barely without murmuring, but even with &s;ome degree of &s;atisfaction and applau&s;e.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The ad|$erents of the prince of Wales join the oppo|&s;ition in parlia|ment.</NOTE> Immediately after the exchange of ratifications at Aix-la-Chapelle the armies were broke up: the allies in the Netherlands withdrew their &s;everal pro|portions of troops; the French began to evacuate Flanders: and the Engli&s;h forces were reimbarked for their own country. His Britannic maje&s;ty re|turned from his German dominions in November, having landed near Margate in Kent, after a danger|our pa&s;&s;age; and on the twenty-ninth of the &s;ame month he opened the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament. By this time the mi&s;under&s;tanding between the two fir&s;t per&s;onages of the royal family had been en|crea&s;ed by a fre&s;h acce&s;&s;ion of matter. The prince of Wales had held a court of &s;tannery, or what is called a parliament, in quality of duke of Cornwall; and revived &s;ome claims attached to that dignity, which, had they been admitted, would have greatly augmented his influence among the Corni&s;h bo|roughs.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="90">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> The&s;e efforts arou&s;ed the jealou&s;y of the admi|ni&s;tration, which had always con&s;idered thm as an intere&s;t wholly depending upon the crown; and therefore the preten&s;ions of his royal highne&s;s were oppo&s;ed by the whole weight of the mini&s;try. His adherents re&s;enting the&s;e ho&s;tilities as an injury to their royal ma&s;ter, immediately joined the remnant of the former oppo&s;ition in parliament, and re|&s;olved to counteract all the mini&s;terial mea&s;ures that &s;hould fall under their cognizance; at lea&s;t, they determined to &s;eize every opportunity of thwart|ing the &s;ervants of the crown, in every &s;cheme or propo&s;al that had not an evident tendency to the advantage of the nation.</P>
<P>This band of auxiliaries was headed by the earl of E&mdash;t, Dr. Lee, and Mr. N&mdash;t. The fir&s;t po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;pecies of eloquence rather plau&s;ible than powerful: he &s;poke with fluency and fire: his &s;pirit was bold and enterpri&s;ing, his apprehen&s;ion quick, and his repartee &s;evere. Dr. Lee was a man of exten&s;ive erudition and irreproachable morals, parti|cularly ver&s;ed in the civil law, which he profe&s;&s;ed, and perfectly well acquainted with the con&s;titution of his country. Mr. N&mdash;t was an orator of mid|dling abilities, who harangued upon all &s;ubjects in|di&s;criminately, and &s;upplied with confidence what he wanted in capacity: he had been at &s;ome pains to &s;tudy the bu&s;ine&s;s of the hou&s;e, as well as to under&s;tand the machine of government; and was tolerably well heard, as he generally &s;poke with an appearance of good humour, and hazarded every whim&s;ical idea as it ro&s;e in his imagination. But Lord Bolingbroke is &s;aid to have been the chief &s;pring which, in &s;ecret, actuated the delibera|tions
<PB N="10" REF="100">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> of the prince's court. That nobleman, &s;eemingly &s;eque&s;tered from the tumults of a pub|lic life, re&s;ided in the neighbourhood of London, at Batter&s;ea, where he was vi&s;ited like a &s;ainted &s;hrine by all the di&s;tingui&s;hed votaries of wit, elo|quence, and political ambition. There he was cul|tivated and admired for the elegance of his man|ners, and the charms of his conver&s;ation. The prince's curio&s;ity was fir&s;t captivated by his cha|racter, and his e&s;teem was afterwards &s;ecured by the irre&s;i&s;tible addre&s;s of that extraordinary per|&s;onage, who continued in a regular progre&s;&s;ion to in&s;inuate him&s;elf &s;till farther and farther into the good graces of his royal patron. How far the conduct of his royal highne&s;s was influenced by the private advice of this nobleman, we &s;hall not pretend to determine: but, certain it is, the friends of the mini&s;try propagated a report, that he was the dictator of tho&s;e mea&s;ures which the prince adopted; and that, under the &s;pecious pretext of attachment to the heir-apparent of the crown, he concealed his real aim, which was to perpetuate the breach in the royal family. Whatever his &s;en|timents and motives might have been, this was no other than a revival of the old mini&s;terial clamour, importing, that a man cannot be well affected to the king, if he pretends to cen&s;ure any mea&s;ure of the admini&s;tration.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of the mi|ni&s;try.</NOTE> The weight which the oppo&s;ition derived from the&s;e new confederates in the hou&s;e of commons, was &s;till greatly overballanced by the power, in|fluence, and ability, that &s;u&s;tained every mini&s;terial project. Mr. Pelham, who chiefly managed the helm of affairs, was generally e&s;teemed as a man of
<PB N="11" REF="110">
hone&s;ty and candour, actuated by a &s;incere love for<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> his country, though he had been educated in er|roneous principles of government, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure obliged to pro&s;ecute a fatal &s;y&s;tem, which de&s;cended to him by inheritance.</P>
<P>At this time he numbered Mr. Pitt among his fellow-mini&s;ters, and was moreover &s;upported by many other individuals of di&s;tingui&s;hed abilities; among whom the fir&s;t place, in point of genius, was due to Mr. M&mdash;, who executed the office of &s;ollicitor-general. This gentleman, the &s;on of a noble family in North Britain, had rai&s;ed him&s;elf to great eminence at the bar, by the mo&s;t keen intuitive &s;pirit of apprehen&s;ion, that &s;eemed to &s;eize every object at fir&s;t glance, an innate &s;agacity that &s;aved the trouble of inten&s;e application, and an irre&s;i&s;tible &s;tream of eloquence, that flowed pure and cla&s;&s;ical, &s;trong and copious, reflecting, in the mo&s;t con&s;picuous point of view, the &s;ubjects over which it rolled, and &s;weeping before it all the &s;lime of formal he&s;itation, and all the intangling weeds of chicanery.</P>
<P>Yet the &s;ervants of the crown were not &s;o im|plicitly attached to the fir&s;t mini&s;ter as to acquie&s;ce in all his plans, and dedicate their time and talents to the &s;upport of every court-mea&s;ure indi&s;crimi|nately. This was one material point in which Mr. Pelham deviated from the maxims of his prede|ce&s;&s;or, who admitted of no contradiction from any of his adherents or fellow-&s;ervants, but in&s;i&s;ted upon their &s;acrificing their whole perception and faculties to his conduct and di&s;po&s;al. That &s;ordid deference to a mini&s;ter no longer characteri&s;ed the &s;ubordinate in&s;truments of the admini&s;tration.
<PB N="12" REF="120">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> It was not unu&s;ual to &s;ee the great officers of the government divided in a parliamentary debate, and to hear the &s;ecretary at war oppo&s;ing with great vehemence a clau&s;e &s;ugge&s;ted by the chancellor of the exchequer.</P>
<P>After all, if we coolly con&s;ider tho&s;e arguments which have been bandied about, and retorted with &s;uch eagerne&s;s and acrimony in the hou&s;e of com|mons, and dive&s;t them of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ionate tropes and declamatory metaphors which the &s;pirit of op|po&s;ition alone had produced, we &s;hall find very little left for the &s;ubject of di&s;pute, and &s;ometimes be puzzled to di&s;cover any material &s;ource of di&s;|agreement.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Se&s;&s;ion opened.</NOTE> In the month of November his maje&s;ty opened the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament with a &s;peech, importing, That the definitive treaty of peace was at length &s;igned by all the parties concerned; That he had made the mo&s;t effectual provi&s;ion for &s;ecuring the rights and intere&s;ts of his own &s;ubjects; and pro|cured for his allies the be&s;t conditions, which, in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of affairs, could be obtained. He &s;aid, he had found a general good di&s;po&s;ition in all parties to bring the negotiation to a happy conclu&s;ion; and ob&s;erved, that we might promi&s;e our&s;elves a long enjoyment of the ble&s;&s;ings of peace. Finally, after having remarked that times of tranquillity were the proper &s;ea&s;ons for le&s;&s;en|ing the national debt, and &s;trengthening the king|dom again&s;t future events, he recommended to the commons the improvement of the public reve|nue, the maintenance of a con&s;iderable naval force, the advancement of commerce, and the cultivation of the arts of peace.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="130">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748&punc;</NOTE> This &s;peech, as u&s;ual, was ecchoed back by an addre&s;s to the throne from both hou&s;es, contain|ing general expre&s;&s;ions of the warme&s;t loyalty and gratitude to his maje&s;ty, and implying the mo&s;t perfect &s;atisfaction and acquie&s;cence in the articles of the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Debate on the addre&s;s&punc;</NOTE> The members in the oppo&s;ition, according to cu&s;tom, cavilled at the nature of this addre&s;s. They ob&s;erved, that the late pacification was the wor&s;t and mo&s;t inglorious of all the bad treaties to which the Engli&s;h nation had ever &s;ub&s;cribed: that it was equally di&s;graceful, indefinite, and ab&s;urd: They &s;aid the Briti&s;h navy had gained &s;uch an a&s;cendency over the French at &s;ea, that the &s;ources of their wealth were already choaked up; that the &s;iege of Mae&s;tricht would have employed their arms in the Low Countries till the arrival of the Ru&s;&s;ians; and that the acce&s;&s;ion of the&s;e auxilia|ries would have thrown the &s;uperiority into the &s;cale of the allies. They did not fail to take no|tice, that the mo&s;t important and original object of the war was left wholly undecided; and they de|mon&s;trated the ab&s;urdity of their promi&s;ing, in the addre&s;s, to make good &s;uch engagements as his maje&s;ty had entered into with his allies&punc; before they knew what tho&s;e engagements were.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to the&s;e objections the mini&s;ters re|plied, That the peace was in it&s;elf rather better than could be expected; and that the &s;malle&s;t delay might have proved fatal to the liberties of Europe. They affirmed, that the Dutch were upon the point of concluding a neutrality, in con&s;equence of which their troops would have been withdrawn from the allied army; and, in that ca&s;e, even the
<PB N="14" REF="140">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> addition of the Ru&s;&s;ian auxiliaries would not have rendered it a match for the enemy. They a&s;&s;erted, That if the war had been prolonged another year, the national credit of Great Britain mu&s;t have been intirely ruined, ina&s;much as many of the public funds had in the preceding &s;ea&s;on &s;unk below par, &s;o that the mini&s;try had begun to de&s;pair of &s;eeing the money paid in on the new &s;ub&s;cription.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the re&s;toration of Cape Breton, the limits of Nova Scotia, and the right of navi|gating without &s;earch in the American &s;eas, which right had been left une&s;tabli&s;hed in the treaty; they declared, That the fir&s;t was an unnece&s;&s;ary expence, of no con&s;equence to Great Britain; and that the other two were points in di&s;pute, to be amicably &s;ettled in private conferences by commi&s;|&s;aries duly authori&s;ed; but by no means articles to be e&s;tabli&s;hed by a general treaty.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h mini&s;try, in the cour&s;e of their par|liamentary conte&s;ts, have generally injured their own projects, by attempting to prove po&s;itions in|di&s;creetly urged in the face of common &s;en&s;e and under&s;tanding. Had they re&s;ted their defence of the treaty upon the imminent danger to which the States of the United Provinces were expo&s;ed, and the certain pro&s;pect of their being obliged to withdraw their forces from the general confederacy, the plea would have been perhaps univer&s;ally ad|mitted; or, at lea&s;t, it would have &s;erved as a plau&s;ible excu&s;e for clo&s;ing with certain propo&s;als, which, in other circum&s;tances, ought to have been rejected with di&s;dain. But, in pre&s;uming to offer &s;uch an outrage to the under&s;tanding of the people, as that of declaring, that the di&s;putes which pro|duced
<PB N="15" REF="150">
the war were not the objects to be di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> in the treaty of peace; and that the national credit of Great Britain would not probably &s;uf|fice to animate the operations of another cam|paign; they expo&s;ed them&s;elves to the cen&s;ure and the ridicule of all the world, and even invalidated the credit which their other allegations had a right to acquire.</P>
<P>If the public credit had run any ri&s;que, or un|dergone the &s;malle&s;t &s;hock, this misfortune was not owing to the war, but to the &s;hameful practices of the mini&s;ters them&s;elves, who endeavoured to make a job of the &s;ub&s;cription, for the benefit of their favourites and under&s;trappers. As in every former expedient of this kind the &s;ub&s;cription had &s;old for a con&s;iderable premium, they concluded that this would meet with the &s;ame eager reception; and in this hope parcelled out the greater part of it among their friends and adherents, though few of them had credit &s;ufficient to borrow money for the fir&s;t payment of the large &s;ums for which they were allowed to &s;ub&s;cribe: a circum&s;tance of which tho&s;e who were really moneyed men took the advantage. They were determined again&s;t &s;ubmitting to the tyranny of this mini&s;terial job; and they re&s;trained their impatience to purcha&s;e, well knowing that the &s;ub&s;cription would fall to a con&s;iderable di&s;count. The difficulty, therefore, that threatened to clog the operations of government, was owing to a &s;can|dalous &s;pirit of monopoly and oppre&s;&s;ion in the members of the admini&s;tration, not to the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the public, which we have lived to &s;ee in a flou|ri&s;hing condition, under the load of much greater incumbrances.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="160">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748. Supplies granted.</NOTE> What the oppo&s;ition wanted in &s;trength, it en|deavoured to make up with &s;pirit and per&s;everance. Every mini&s;terial motion and mea&s;ure was can|va&s;&s;ed, &s;ifted, and impugned with uncommon art and vivacity: but all this little availed again&s;t the &s;ingle article of &s;uperior number; and accord|ingly this was the &s;ource of certain triumph in all debates, in which the &s;ervants of the crown were united. The nation had rea&s;on to expect an im|mediate mitigation in the article of annual expence, con&s;idering the number of troops and &s;hips of war which had been reduced at the ratification of the treaty: but they were di&s;agreeably undeceived in finding them&s;elves again loaded with very extraor|dinary impo&s;itions, for the payment of a va&s;t debt which the government had contracted in the cour&s;e of the war, notwith&s;tanding the incredible aids granted in parliament.</P>
<P>Four points of con&s;ideration did the committee of &s;upply e&s;tabli&s;h, in their deliberations concern|ing the &s;ums nece&s;&s;ary to be rai&s;ed; namely, for fulfilling the engagements which the parliament had entered into with his maje&s;ty, and the &s;ervices undertaken for the &s;ucce&s;s of the war; for di&s;|charging debts contracted by the government; for making good deficiencies; and for defraying the current expence of the year.</P>
<P>It appeared, that the nation owed four and forty thou&s;and pounds to the elector of Bavaria; above thirty thou&s;and to the duke of Brun&s;wic; the like &s;um to the landgrave of He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el; and near nine thou&s;and pounds to the elector of Mentz. The queen of Hungary claimed an arrear of one hun|dred thou&s;and pounds. The city of Gla&s;gow, in
<PB N="17" REF="170">
North Britain, pre&s;ented a petition, praying to be<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748&punc;</NOTE> reimbur&s;ed in the &s;um of ten thou&s;and pounds, ex|torted from that corporation by the &s;on of the Pre|tender, during the rebellion. One hundred and twelve thou&s;and pounds were owing to the forces in North America and the Ea&s;t Indies; be&s;ides near half a million due on extraordinary expence incurred by the land forces in America, Flanders, and North Britain, the office of ordnance, and other &s;ervices of the la&s;t year, to which the par|liamentary provi&s;ion did not extend. The re|maining debt of the ordnance amounted to above two hundred and thirty thou&s;and pounds: but the navy bills could not be di&s;charged for le&s;s than four millions. The addition of two millions three hun|dred and &s;eventy four thou&s;and three hundred thir|ty-three pounds fifteen &s;hillings and two pence, were required for the current &s;ervice of the year. In a word, the whole annual &s;upply exceeded eight millions &s;terling; a &s;um at which the whole nation expre&s;&s;ed equal a&s;toni&s;hment and di&s;gu&s;t. It was charged upon the duties on malt, mum, cyder, and perry, the land-tax at four &s;hillings in the pound, annuities on the &s;inking fund, an applica|tion of one million from that depo&s;it, and a loan of the like &s;um to be charged on the fir&s;t aids of next &s;e&s;&s;ion. The number of &s;eamen was reduced to &s;eventeen thou&s;and, and that of the land forces to eighteen thou&s;and eight hundred and fifty-&s;even, including guards and garri&s;ons.</P>

The fir&s;t, under the title of a bill for amending, explaining, and reducing into one act of parlia|ment the laws relating to the navy, was calculated &s;olely with a view of &s;ubjecting half-pay officers to martial law: a de&s;ign which not only furni&s;hed the oppo&s;ition with a plau&s;ible handle for accu&s;ing the mini&s;ters, as intending to encroach upon the con|&s;titution, in order to extend the influence of the crown; but al&s;o alarmed the &s;ea-officers to &s;uch a degree, that they a&s;&s;embled to a con&s;iderable num|ber, with a view to deliberate upon the proper means for defending their privileges and liberties from inva&s;ion.</P>
<P>The re&s;ult of their con&s;ultations was a petition to the hou&s;e of commons, &s;ub&s;cribed by three ad|mirals and forty-&s;even captains, not members of parliament, importing, That the bill in agitation contained &s;everal clau&s;es tending to the injury and di&s;honour of all naval officers, as well as to the detriment of his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice; and that the laws already in force had been always found effectual for &s;ecuring the &s;ervice of officers on half-pay, upon the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing occa&s;ions: they therefore hoped, that they &s;hould not be &s;ubjected to new hard&s;hips and di&s;couragements; and begged to be heard by their coun&s;el, before the committee of the whole hou&s;e, touching &s;uch parts of the bill as they ap|prehended would be injurious to them&s;elves and the other officers of his maje&s;ty's navy. This petition was pre&s;ented to the hou&s;e by Sir John Nor|ris, and the motion for its being read was &s;econd|ed

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> by Sir Peter Warren, who&s;e character was uni|ver&s;ally e&s;teemed and beloved in the nation.</P>
<P>This mea&s;ure had like to have produced very &s;erious con&s;equences. Many commanders and &s;ub|al$erns had repaired to the board of admiralty, and threatened, in plain terms, to throw up their com|mi&s;&s;ions, in ca&s;e the bill &s;hould pa&s;s into a law; and a general ferment was begun among all the &s;ubordinate members of the navy. A motion was made, That the petitioners, according to their re|que&s;t, &s;hould be heard by their coun&s;el; and this propo&s;al was &s;trongly urged by the fir&s;t orators of the antimini&s;terial a&s;&s;ociation: but the mini&s;ter, confiding in his own &s;trength, reinforced by the abilities of Mr. Pitt, Mr. Lyttleton, and Mr. Fox the &s;ecretary at war, &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed the mo|tion, which, upon a divi&s;ion, was thrown out by a great majority.</P>
<P>The &s;everal articles of the bill were afterwards &s;eparately debated with great warmth; and al|though Mr. Pelham had, with the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted air of candour, repeatedly declared that he required no &s;upport, even from his own adherents, but that which might ari&s;e from rea&s;on unre&s;trained, and full conviction, he, on this occa&s;ion, reaped all the fruit of their zeal and attachment which could be expected from the mo&s;t implicit complai&s;ance. Some plau&s;ible amendments of the mo&s;t exception|able clau&s;es were offered, particularly of that which impo&s;ed an oath upon the members of every court-martial, importing, that they &s;hould not, on any ac|count, di&s;clo&s;e the opinions or tran&s;actions of any &s;uch tribunal. This was con&s;idered as a &s;anction under which any court-martial might commit the mo&s;t fla|grant
<PB N="21" REF="210">
acts of inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion, which even<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> the parliament it&s;elf could not redre&s;s, becau&s;e it would be impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain the truth, eternally &s;ealed up by this ab&s;urd obligation. The amendment propo&s;ed was, that the member of a court-martial might reveal the tran&s;actions and opinions of it, in all ca&s;es wherein the courts of ju&s;tice, as the law now &s;tands, have a right to interfere, if required thereto by either hou&s;e of parliament: a very rea|&s;onable mitigation, which however was rejected by the majority. Neverthele&s;s, the &s;u&s;picion of an in|tended encroachment had rai&s;ed &s;uch a clamour without doors, and diffu&s;ed the odium of this mea|&s;ure &s;o generally, that the mini&s;ter thought proper to drop the projected article of war, &s;ubjecting the reformed officers of the navy to the juri&s;diction of courts martial; and the bill being al&s;o &s;oftened in other particulars, during its pa&s;&s;age through the upper hou&s;e, at length received the royal a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Objecti|ons to the mutiny-bill.</NOTE> The flame which this act had kindled, was rather encrea&s;ed than abated at the appearance of a new mutiny-bill, replete with divers innovations, tend|ing to augment the influence of the crown, as well as the authority and power of a military juri&s;dic|tion. All the articles of war e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;ince the reign of the &s;econd Charles, were &s;ubmitted to the in&s;pection of the commons; and in the&s;e appeared a gradual &s;pirit of encroachment, almo&s;t imper|ceptibly deviating from the civil in&s;titutes of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, towards the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a military dominion. By this new bill a power was ve&s;ted in any commander in chief to revi&s;e and cor|rect any legal &s;entence of a court-martial, by which the members of &s;uch a court, corre&s;ponding with
<PB N="22" REF="220">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> the nature of a civil jury, were rendered ab&s;olutely u&s;ele&s;s, and the commander in a great mea&s;ure ab|&s;olute; for he had not only the power of &s;ummoning &s;uch officers as he might choo&s;e to fit on any trial, a prerogative unknown to any civil court of judica|ture: but he was al&s;o at liberty to review and alter the &s;entence; &s;o that a man was &s;ubject to two trials for the &s;ame offence, and the commander in chief was judge both of the guilt and the puni&s;h|ment. By the final clau&s;e of this bill, the martial law was extended to all officers on half-pay; and the &s;ame argument, which had been urged again&s;t this article in the navy-bill, were now repeated and reinforced with redoubled fervour. Many rea&s;ons were offered to prove that the half-pay was allotted as a recompence for pa&s;t &s;ervice; and the opponents of the bill affirmed, that &s;uch an article, by aug|menting the dependents of the crown, might be very dangerous to the con&s;titution. On the other hand, the parti&s;ans of the mini&s;try a&s;&s;erted that the half-pay was granted as a retaining fee; and that originally all tho&s;e who enjoyed this indulgence, were deemed to be in actual &s;ervice, con&s;equently &s;ubject to martial law. Mr. P&mdash;, who at this time exerci&s;ed the office of payma&s;ter general with a rigour of integrity unknown to the mo&s;t di&s;inte|re&s;ted of all his predece&s;&s;ors in that department e&s;|pou&s;ed the clau&s;e in di&s;pute, as a nece&s;&s;ary exten|&s;ion of military di&s;cipline which could never be at|tended with any bad con&s;equence to the liberty of the nation. The remarks which he made on this occa&s;ion implied an opinion that our liberties wholly exi&s;ted in dependence upon the direction of the &s;o|vereign, and the virtue of the army. "To that
<PB N="23" REF="230">
virtue, &s;aid he, we tru&s;t even at this hour, &s;mall<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> as our army is&mdash;to that virtue we mu&s;t have tru&s;ted had this bill been modelled as its warme&s;t oppo&s;ers could have wi&s;hed; and without this virtue, &s;hould the lords, the commons, and the people of Eng|land intrench them&s;elves behind parchment up to the teeth, the &s;word will find a pa&s;&s;age to the vitals of the con&s;titution." This being the ca&s;e, vain, fruitle&s;s, and unnece&s;&s;ary, mu&s;t tho&s;e precautions be, which are &s;o carefully tran&s;mitted from one &s;e&s;&s;ion to another, in order to re&s;train the military power within the con&s;titutional pale of parliament. At any rate, it cannot &s;urely be advi&s;able to e&s;ta|bli&s;h &s;uch new regulations as may po&s;&s;ibly be produc|tive of prejudice to national liberty, unle&s;s the want of them had been proved detrimental to the &s;er|vice of the public.</P>
<P>All the di&s;puted articles of the bill being &s;u&s;|tained on the &s;houlders of a great majority, it was conveyed to the upper hou&s;e, where it excited an|other violent conte&s;t. Upon the que&s;tion whether officers on half-pay had not been &s;ubject to martial law, the judges were con&s;ulted and divided in their &s;entiments. The earl of Bath declared his opinion, that the martial-law did not extend to reformed of|ficers; and opened all the &s;luices of his antient elo|quence. He admitted a ca&s;e which was urged of &s;even officers on half pay, who, being taken in ac|tual rebellion at Pre&s;ton, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifteen, had been executed on the &s;pot by martial law, in con&s;equence of the king's expre&s;s order. He candidly owned, that he him&s;elf was &s;ecretary at war at that period: that he had approved of this order, and even tran&s;|mitted it to general Carpenter, who commanded at
<PB N="24" REF="240">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> Pre&s;ton; but now his opinion was entirely changed. He ob&s;erved that when the forementioned rebel|lion fir&s;t broke out, the hou&s;e pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the king, de&s;iring his maje&s;ty would be plea&s;ed to employ all half-pay officers, and gratify them with whole pay; and indeed all &s;uch officers were voted on whole pay, by the hou&s;e of commons. They were afterwards appri&s;ed of this vote, by an adverti&s;ement in the Gazette, and ordered to hold them&s;elves in readine&s;s for repairing to &s;uch places as &s;hould be appointed; and finally commanded to repair by &s;uch a day to tho&s;e places, on pain of be|ing &s;truck off the li&s;t of half-pay. The&s;e precau|tions would have been unnece&s;&s;ary had they been deemed &s;ubject to martial law; and the penalty for non-obedience would not have been merely a privation of their pen&s;ions, but they would have fallen under the puni&s;hment of death as de&s;erters from the &s;ervice. His lord&s;hip di&s;tingui&s;hed, with great propriety and preci&s;ion, between a &s;tep which had been precipitately taken in a violent cri&s;is, when the public was heated with apprehen&s;ion and re&s;ent|ment, and a &s;olemn law concerted at lei&s;ure, during the mo&s;t profound tranquillity. Notwith&s;tanding the &s;pirited oppo&s;ition of this nobleman, and &s;ome attempts to in&s;ert additional clau&s;es, the bill having undergone a few incon&s;iderable amendments, pa&s;&s;ed by virtue of a very con&s;iderable majority.</P>
<P>Immediately after the mutiny bill had pa&s;&s;ed the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bill for limiting the term of a &s;ol|dier's &s;er|vice.</NOTE> lower hou&s;e, another fruitle&s;s effort was made by the oppo&s;ition. The danger of a &s;tanding army, on who&s;e virtue the con&s;titution of Great Britain &s;eemed to depend, did not &s;ail to alarm the minds of many who were zealou&s;ly attached to the liber|ties of their country, and gave birth to a &s;cheme,
<PB N="25" REF="250">
which, if executed, would have enabled the legi|&s;lature<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> to e&s;tabli&s;h a militia that mu&s;t have an|&s;wered many national purpo&s;es, and acted as a con|&s;titutional bulwark again&s;t the exce&s;&s;es and ambi|tion of a military &s;tanding force, under the imme|diate influence of the government. The &s;cheme which patrioti&s;m conceived, was, in all probability, adopted by party. A motion was made, and a bill brought in, limiting the time beyond which no &s;oldier, or non commi&s;&s;ioned officer &s;hould be compelled to continue in the &s;ervice. Had this limitation taken place, &s;uch a rotation of &s;oldiers would have en&s;ued among the common people, that in a few years every pea&s;ant, labourer, and inferior trade&s;man in the kingdom, would have under&s;tood the exerci&s;e of arms; and perhaps the people in general would have concluded, that a &s;tanding army was altogether unnece&s;&s;ary. A pro|ject of this nature could not, for obvious rea&s;ons, be agreeable to the admini&s;tration, and therefore the bill was rendered abortive; for, after having been twice read, it was po&s;tponed from time to time until the parliament was prorogued, and never ap|peared in the &s;equel.</P>
<P>Such were the chief &s;ubjects of debate between the mini&s;try and the oppo&s;ition, compo&s;ed, as we have already ob&s;erved, of the prince's &s;ervants and the remains of the country party, this la&s;t being headed by lord Strange, &s;on of the earl of Derby, and Sir Francis Da&s;hwood; the former a noble|man of di&s;tingui&s;hed abilities, keen, penetrating, eloquent, and &s;agacious; the other frank, &s;pirited, and &s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be owned, however, for the honour of the mini&s;try, that, if they carried a few unpopular
<PB N="26" REF="260">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> mea&s;ures with a high hand, they &s;eemed earne&s;tly de&s;irous of making amends to the nation, by pro|moting divers regulations for the benefit and im|provement of commerce, which actually took place in the en&s;uing &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament. One of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mea&s;ures taken with re|&s;pect to the Afri|can trade.</NOTE> principal objects of this nature, which fell under their cognizance, was the trade to the coa&s;t of Guinea; a very important branch of traffic, whe|ther con&s;idered as a market for Briti&s;h manufac|tures, or as the &s;ource that &s;upplied the Engli&s;h plantations with negroes. This was originally mo|nopolized by a joint-&s;tock company, which had from time to time derived con&s;iderable &s;ums from the legi&s;lature, for enabling them the better to &s;upport certain forts or ca&s;tles on the coa&s;t of Afri|ca, to facilitate the commerce and protect the mer|chants. In the &s;equel, however, the exclu&s;ive pri|vilege having been judged prejudicial to the na|tional trade, the coa&s;t was laid open to all Briti&s;h &s;ubjects indi&s;criminately, upon condition that they &s;hould pay a certain duty towards defraying the ex|pence of the forts and factories.</P>
<P>This expedient did not an&s;wer the purpo&s;es for which it had been contrived. The &s;eparate traders, in&s;tead of receiving any benefit from the protection of the company, indu&s;triou&s;ly avoided their ca&s;tles, as the receptacles of tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion. The company, whether from the mi&s;conduct or knavery of their directors, contracted &s;uch a load of debts as their &s;tock was unable to di&s;charge. They &s;eemed to neglect the traffic, and allowed the ca&s;|tles to decay. In a word, their credit being ex|hau&s;ted, and their creditors growing clamourous, they pre&s;ented a petition to the hou&s;e of commons,
<PB N="27" REF="270">
di&s;clo&s;ing their di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and imploring &s;uch a&s;|&s;i&s;tance<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> as &s;hould enable them not only to pay their debts, but al&s;o to maintain the forts in a de|fen&s;ible condition. This petition, recommended to the hou&s;e in a me&s;&s;age from his maje&s;ty, was cor|roborated by another in behalf of the company's creditors. Divers merchants of London, intere&s;ted in the trade of Africa, and the Briti&s;h plantations of America, petitioned the hou&s;e, that as the Afri|can trade was of the utmo&s;t importance to the na|tion, and could not be &s;upported without forts and &s;ettlements, &s;ome effectual means &s;hould be &s;pee|dily taken for protecting and extending this va|luable branch of commerce. A fourth was of|fered by the merchants of Liverpool, repre&s;enting, that the &s;ecurity and protection of the trade to Africa mu&s;t always principally depend upon his maje&s;ty's &s;hips of war, properly &s;tationed on that coa&s;t, and &s;ea&s;onably relieved; and that &s;uch forts and &s;ettlements as might be judged nece&s;&s;ary for marks of &s;overeignty and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, would prove a nui&s;ance and a burthen to the trade, &s;hould they remain in the hands of any joint-&s;tock company, who&s;e private intere&s;t always had been, and ever would be, found incompatible with the intere&s;t of the &s;eparate and open trader. They therefore prayed, that the &s;aid forts might either be taken into his maje&s;ty's immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and &s;up|ported by the public, or committed to the mer|chants trading on that coa&s;t, in &s;uch a manner as the hou&s;e &s;hould judge expedient, without ve&s;ting in them any other advantage or right to the com|merce, but what &s;hould be common to all his ma|je&s;ty's &s;ubjects.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="280">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> This remon&s;trance was &s;ucceeded by another, to the &s;ame effect, from the ma&s;ter, wardens, a&s;&s;i&s;t|ants, and commonalty of the &s;ociety of merchant-adventurers within the city of Bri&s;tol.</P>
<P>All the&s;e petitions were referred to a committee appointed to deliberate on this &s;ubject; and they agreed to certain re&s;olutions, importing, That the trade to Africa &s;hould be free and open; That the Briti&s;h forts and &s;ettlements on that coa&s;t ought to be maintained and put under proper direction; and, That, in order to carry on the African trade in the mo&s;t beneficial manner to the&s;e kingdoms, all the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects trading to Africa &s;hould be united in one open company, without any joint-&s;tock, or power to trade as a corporation. A bill was immediately founded on the&s;e re&s;olutions, which alarmed the company to &s;uch a degree, that they had recour&s;e to another petition, demon|&s;trating their right to the coa&s;t of Africa, and ex|pre&s;&s;ing their reliance on the ju&s;tice of the hou&s;e, that they &s;hould not be deprived of their property without an adequate con&s;ideration. In a few days a &s;econd addre&s;s was offered by their creditors, complaining of the company's mi&s;management, promi&s;ing to &s;urrender their right, as the wi&s;dom of parliament &s;hould pre&s;cribe; praying, that their debts might be inquired into; and that the equi|valent, to be granted for the company's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, might be &s;ecured and applied, in the fir&s;t place, for their benefit. The commons, in con&s;equence of this petition, ordered the company to produce a li&s;t of their debts, together with a copy of their charter, and two remon&s;trances which their credi|tors had pre&s;ented to them before this application

to parliament. A committee of the whole hou&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> having deliberated on the&s;e papers and petitions, and heard the company by their coun&s;el, re&s;olved to give them a rea&s;onable compen&s;ation for their charter, lands, forts, &s;ettlements, &s;laves, and ef|fects, to be, in the fir&s;t place, applied towards the payment of their creditors. A bill being formed accordingly, pa&s;&s;ed through the commons, and was conveyed to the upper hou&s;e, where a great many objections were &s;tarted; and for the pre&s;ent it was dropped, until a plan more exceptionable &s;hould be concerted. In the mean time their lord&s;hips addre&s;&s;ed his maje&s;ty, That the lords commi&s;&s;ioners for trade and plantations might be directed to pre|pare a &s;cheme on this &s;ubject to be laid before both hou&s;es of parliament at the beginning of next &s;e&s;|&s;ion; That in&s;tant orders &s;hould be given for pre|&s;erving and &s;ecuring the forts and &s;ettlements on the coa&s;t of Guinea belonging to Great Britain; and, That proper per&s;ons &s;hould be appointed to examine into the condition of tho&s;e forts, as well as of the military &s;tores, &s;laves, and ve&s;&s;els belonging to the African company, &s;o as to make a faithful report of the&s;e particulars, with all po&s;&s;ible expe|dition.</P>

It was &s;ugge&s;ted, that the company had long ago enriched them&s;elves by their exclu&s;ive privilege; that they employed no more than four annual &s;hips; that, contrary to an expre&s;s injunc|tion in their charter, they di&s;couraged all attempts to di&s;cover a north-we&s;t pa&s;&s;age to the Ea&s;t-Indies; that they dealt cruelly and perfidiou&s;ly with the poor Indians, who never traded with them, except when compelled by nece&s;&s;ity, &s;o that the be&s;t part of the fur-trade had devolved to the enemies of Great Britain; and that their exclu&s;ive patent re|&s;tricted to very narrow limits a branch of com|merce, which might be cultivated to a prodiglous extent, as well as to the infinite advantage of Great Britain.</P>
<P>Petitions, that the trade of Hud&s;on's bay might be laid open, were pre&s;ented to the hou&s;e by mer|chants of London, Great Yarmouth, and Wolver|hampton; and a committee was appointed to delibe|rate upon the &s;ubject. On the other hand, the com|pany exerted them&s;elves in petitions, and private applications for their own pre&s;ervation. The com|mittee examined papers and records; and the re|port was taken into con&s;ideration by the whole hou&s;e. Many evidences were interrogated, and elaborate &s;peeches made, on both &s;ides of the que&s;|tion.

This, however, was but an indifferent excu&s;e, provided the trade was really capable of con&s;iderable exten&s;ion: for the company, having already enriched them&s;elves by their charter, had no right to demand an in|demnification; and the expence of maintaining the forts, being trifling in it&s;elf, would have been am|ply refunded by the augmentation of the na|tional commerce.</P>

So little was the intere&s;t of his family con&s;idered in this negotiation, that the contracting powers agreed, without re&s;erve, to a literal in&s;ertion of the fifth article of the quadruple alliance; by which it was &s;tipulated, That neither the pretender nor any of his de&s;cendants &s;hould be allowed to re&s;ide within the territories belonging to any of the &s;ub|&s;cribing parties. At the &s;ame time the plenipo|tentiaries of France promi&s;ed to tho&s;e of Great Britain, that prince Edward &s;hould be immediately obliged to quit the dominions of his mo&s;t chri&s;tian maje&s;ty.

The re|gency having complied in this particular with the earne&s;t reque&s;t of his mo&s;t chri&s;tian maje&s;ty, Mr. Burnaby, the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter to the Helvetic Body, took the alarm, and pre&s;ented the magi&s;tracy of Fribourg with a remon&s;trance, couched in &s;uch terms as gave offence to that regency, and drew

In vain had the French king exerted his influence in procuring this retreat for the young pretender, who, being pre&s;&s;ed with repeated me&s;&s;ages to withdraw, per|&s;i&s;ted in refu&s;ing to quit the place, to which he had been &s;o cordially invited by his cou&s;in the king of France; and where (he &s;aid) that monarch had &s;olemnly promi&s;ed, on the word of a king, that he would never for&s;ake him in his di&s;tre&s;s, nor aban|don the intere&s;ts of his family.</P>
<P>Louis was not a little perplexed at this ob&s;tinacy of prince Edward, which was the more vexatious as that youth appeared to be the darling of the Pari&s;ians; who not only admired him for his ac|compli&s;hments, and pitied him for his &s;ufferings, but al&s;o revered him as a young hero lineally de|&s;cended from their renowned fourth Henry.</P>
<P>At length the two Engli&s;h noblemen arriving at Paris, as ho&s;tages for performance of the treaty, and &s;eeing him appear at all public &s;pectacles, complained of this circum&s;tance as an in&s;ult offered to their &s;overeign, and even as an infringement of the treaty &s;o lately concluded. The French king, after &s;ome he&s;itation between punctilio and convenience, re&s;olved to employ violence upon the per&s;on of this trouble&s;ome &s;tranger, &s;ince milder remon&s;trances had not been able to influence his conduct: but this re&s;olution was not taken till the return of a courier whom he di&s;patched to the Chevalier de St. George; who, being thus in|formed of his &s;on's deportment, wrote a letter to him, laying &s;trong injunctions upon him to yield to the nece&s;&s;ity of the times, and acquie&s;ce with a good grace in the &s;tipulations which his cou&s;in of

<P>Edward, far from complying with this advice and injunction, &s;ignified his re&s;olution to remain in Paris; and even declared, that he would pi&s;tol any man who &s;hould pre&s;ume to lay violent hands on his per&s;on. In con&s;equence of this bold decla|ration, an extraordinary council was held at Ver|&s;ailles, where it was determined to arre&s;t him with|out further delay, and the whole plan of this en|terprize was finally adju&s;ted. The &s;ame evening, the prince entering the narrow lane that leads to the opera, the barrier was immediately &s;hut, and the &s;erjeant of the guard called "To arms." Then mon&s;ieur de Vaudreuil, exempt of the French guards, advancing to Edward, "Prince, (&s;aid he) I ar$e&s;t you in the king's name, by virtue of this order." At that in&s;tant he was &s;urrounded by four grenadiers, in order to prevent any mi&s;chief he might have done with a ca&s;e of pocket-pi&s;tols which he always carried about with him; and a guard was placed on all the avenues and doors of the opera-hou&s;e, left any tumult &s;hould have en&s;ued, among the populace. The&s;e precautions being taken, Vaudreuil, with an e&s;corte, conducted the pri&s;oner through the garden of the Palais Royal to a hou&s;e where the duke de Biron waited, with a coach and &s;ix, to convey him to the ca&s;tle of Vincennes, whi|ther he was immediately accompanied by a detach|ment from the regiment of French guards, under the command of that nobleman. He had not re|mained above three days in this confinement when he gave the French mini&s;try to under&s;tand, that he would conform him&s;elf to the king's intentions;
<PB N="48" REF="490">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> and was immediately enlarged, upon giving his word and honour that he would, without delay, re|tire from the dominions of France. Accordingly he &s;et out in four days from Fountainbleau, at|tended by three officers, who conducted him as far as Pont-Beauvoi&s;in on the frontiers, where they took their leave of him, and returned to Ver&s;ailles. He proceeded for &s;ome time in the road to Cham|berri; but &s;oon returned into the French domi|nions, and, pa&s;&s;ing through Dauphine, repaired to Avignon, where he was received with extraordi|nary honours by the pope's legate.</P>
<P>In the mean time his arre&s;t excited great mur|murings at Paris; the inhabitants of which blamed, without &s;cruple, their king's conduct in this in|&s;tance, as a &s;candalous breach of ho&s;pitality, as well as a mean proof of conde&s;cen&s;ion to the king of England; and many &s;evere pa&s;quinades, relating to this tran&s;action, were fixed up in the mo&s;t pub|lic places of that metropolis.</P>

He now wrote a letter to his uncle the king of Great Britain, complaining of the in&s;ults and menaces which had been offered by the Czarina to Sweden; declaring; that he was bound by a defen&s;ive alliance, to which France had acceded, to defend the government at pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hed in Sweden; and that he would not &s;it &s;till and tamely &s;ee that kingdom attacked by any power what&s;oever, without acting up to his engagements: finally, he intreated his Britannic maje&s;ty to interpo&s;e his good offices, in conjunction with France and him, to compromi&s;e the di&s;putes which threatened to embroil the northern parts of Europe.</P>
<P>By this time the Ru&s;&s;ian army had approached the frontiers of Finland: the Swedes had a&s;&s;embled their troops, repleni&s;hed their magazines, and re|paired their marine; and the king of Denmark, jealous of the Czarina's de&s;igns, with regard to the dutchy of Sle&s;wic, which was conte&s;ted with him by the prince &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Ru&s;&s;ia, kept his army and navy on the mo&s;t re&s;pectable footing.</P>

He reformed the laws of Brandenburg, and re&s;cued the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice from the frauds of chicanery.

Even all the conde&s;cen&s;ion of tho&s;e who di&s;grace them&s;elves with the title of allies to the&s;e mi&s;creants, is not al|ways &s;ufficient to re&s;train them from acts of cru|elty and rapine.</P>
<P>At this very period four crui&s;ers from Algiers made a capture of an Engli&s;h packet-boat, in her voyage from Li&s;bon, and conveyed her to their city, where &s;he was plundered of money and effects to the amount of one hundred thou&s;and pounds, and afterwards di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.

<P>Britain, mean while, was altogether barren of events which might de&s;erve a place in a general hi&s;tory.

But Mr. Pelham, who &s;u&s;tained the whole weight of the debate on the &s;ide of the admini&s;tra|tion, an&s;wered every objection with equal candour and ability: and if he failed in proving that the terms of peace were as favourable as could be ex|pected, con&s;idering the unfortunate events of the war, and the &s;ituation of the contending powers, $e at lea&s;t demon&s;trated, that it would be the in|tere&s;t of the kingdom to acquie&s;ce for the pre&s;ent in the treaty which had been concluded, and en|deavour to remedy its imperfections by &s;ub&s;equent conventions, amicably opened among tho&s;e powers between whom any cau&s;e of di&s;pute remained.

He reminded them, that a parliament of Great Britain had once voted "no peace, while any part of the We&s;t Indies &s;hould remain in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Spani&s;h king," yet a train of inci|dents, which they could not po&s;&s;ibly fore&s;ee, after|wards

We &s;hall always, however, except the efforts that were made for reducing the number of land-forces to fifteen thou&s;and, and maintaining a greater number of &s;eamen than the mini&s;try propo&s;ed. On the&s;e con&s;titutional points the earl of Egmont, and the other chiefs of the oppo&s;ition, expatiated with all the energy of eloquence; which, however, was fru&s;trated by the power of &s;uperior number. Ten thou&s;and &s;eamen were voted for the &s;ervice of the en&s;uing year, notwith&s;tanding his maje&s;ty's injunc|tion to maintain a con&s;iderable navy; and the number of land-forces continued at eighteen thou|&s;and eight hundred and fifty-&s;even. The &s;ums granted for making good his maje&s;ty's engage|ments with the electors of Bavaria and Mentz, and the duke of Brun&s;wic-Wolfenbuttle, amounted to fifty-three thou&s;and two hundred and twenty-five pounds &s;terling. The &s;ervices done by the colo|nies in North America, during the war, were gra|tified with the &s;um of one hundred twenty-two thou&s;and two hundred forty-&s;ix pounds. The ex|pence incurred by the new colony of Nova Scotia exceeded &s;eventy-&s;ix thou&s;and pounds.

It was not very much for the honour of the oppo|&s;ition, that &s;ome of its leading members endea|voured to impede this great machine of civil oeco|nomy, by taking opportunities of affirming in par|liament, in oppo&s;ition to his maje&s;ty's &s;peech, that the nation, far from being in a flouri&s;hing condi|tion, was almo&s;t intirely exhau&s;ted; that com|merce drooped and declined; that public credit &s;tood tottering on the brink of ruin; and that all the treaties lately concluded among the different

powers of Europe, were, in effect, di&s;advantageous<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1749.</NOTE> and prejudicial to the intere&s;ts of Great Britain. In an&s;wer to the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions, Mr. Pelham under|took to prove, from the regi&s;ter of exports and im|ports, that the commerce of the kingdom was more exten&s;ive at this than at any former period; and that the public credit was &s;trong enough to admit of an experiment, which he would not pre|&s;ume to hazard, except upon a moral certainty of its being firmly rooted, beyond the power of acci|dent and faction to &s;hake or overturn. He de|clared, that his de&s;ign of reducing the intere&s;t upon the funds, was the re&s;ult of the love he bore his country, and an opinion that it was the duty of the &s;ervants of the crown to ea&s;e the burthens of the people. He &s;aid, he had conferred on this &s;ubject with per&s;ons of the mo&s;t approved know|ledge, and undoubted experience; and cho&s;e to promulgate the method propo&s;ed for alleviating the load of the national debt, that the public, in knowing the particulars of the &s;cheme, might have time to con&s;ider them at lei&s;ure, and &s;tart &s;uch ob|jections as &s;hould occur to their reflection, before it might be too late to adopt amendments. He ob&s;erved, that nothing could more clearly demon|&s;trate the vigour of public credit, and the aug|mentation of national commerce, than the price of &s;tock, which had within three years ri&s;en to a very con&s;iderable increa&s;e; and the duties on im|ports, which in nine months had added one million to the &s;inking fond, notwith&s;tanding a very extra|ordinary &s;um which had been payed as bounties for exported corn.

His plan was accord|ingly communicated, canva&s;&s;ed, and approved in the hou&s;e of commons, and an act pa&s;&s;ed for re|ducing the intere&s;t of the funds which con&s;titute the intere&s;t of the national debt.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The bill pa&s;&s;es through both hou&s;es.</NOTE> The re&s;olutions of the commons on this head were printed by authority in the London Gazette, importing, That tho&s;e who were, or &s;hould be, proprietors of any part of the public debt, re|deemable by law, incurred before Michaelmas, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and forty|nine, carrying an intere&s;t of four per centum per annum, who &s;hould, on or before the twenty-eighth day of February in that year, &s;ub&s;cribe their names, &s;ignifying their con&s;ent to accept of an in|tere&s;t of three pounds per centum, to commence from the twenty-fifth day of December in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-&s;even, &s;ubject to the &s;ame provi&s;ions, notices and clau&s;es, of re|demption, to which their re&s;pective &s;ums, at four per centum, were then liable; &s;hould, in lieu of their pre&s;ent intere&s;t, be intitled to four per cen|tum, till the twenty fifth day of December in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty; and after that day, to three pounds ten &s;hillings per centum per annum, till the twenty-fifth day of De|cember one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-&s;even; and no part of that debt, except what was due to the Ea&s;t India company, &s;hould be redeem|able

For this purpo&s;e his maje&s;ty was enabled to borrow of any per&s;on or per&s;ons, bodies politic or corporate, any &s;um or &s;ums of money, not exceeding that part of the na|tional debt which might remain un&s;ub&s;cribed, to be charged on the &s;inking fund, upon any terms not exceeding the rate of intere&s;t in the aforegoing propo&s;al.</P>
<P>All the duties appropriated to the payment of the intere&s;t were &s;till continued, and the &s;urplus of the&s;e incorporated with the &s;inking fund for the di&s;charge of the principal. Books were opened for the &s;ub&s;cription at the Exchequer, the bank of England, and the South-&s;ea&punc;hou&s;e; and copies of the&s;e re&s;olutions tran&s;mitted to the directors of all the monied corporations.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of this act, for the reduction of the intere&s;t, the greater part of the creditors com|plied with the terms propo&s;ed, and &s;ub&s;cribed their re&s;pective annuities before the end of February; but the three great companies at fir&s;t kept aloof, and refu&s;ed to &s;ub&s;cribe any part of their capital.</P>
<P>About the middle of March the commons or|dered the proper officers to lay before them an ac|count of the &s;ums which had been &s;ub&s;cribed, and the&s;e were taken into con&s;ideration by a com|mittee of the whole hou&s;e.

With re&s;pect to the proprietors of the &s;tock or capital belonging to the three great companies, he a&s;&s;erted, that many of them would willingly have &s;ub&s;cribed their pro|perties within the time limited; but were nece&s;&s;a|rily excluded by the majority on the ballot: and as it was equally impo&s;&s;ible to know tho&s;e who were again&s;t the que&s;tion on the ballot, he thought that &s;ome tenderne&s;s was due even to the proprietors of tho&s;e three companies: his opinion therefore was, that they and the complying annuitants &s;hould be indulged with further time to compleat their &s;ub&s;cription; but, in order to pre&s;erve the autho|rity of parliament, and the re&s;pect due to that au|gu&s;t a&s;&s;embly, they ought not to be gratified with &s;uch advantageous terms as were allowed to the annuitants, who at fir&s;t chearfully complied with the propo&s;als offered by the legi&s;lature.

The propo&s;al being approved, a bill was framed for this pur|po&s;e, as well as for redeeming &s;uch annuities as &s;hould not be &s;ub&s;cribed. It pa&s;&s;ed through both hou&s;es, and was enacted into a law, after having received an additional clau&s;e, impowering the Ea&s;t India company, in ca&s;e they &s;hould &s;ub&s;cribe all their &s;tock bearing an intere&s;t of four per cen|tum, to borrow, with the con&s;ent of the board of trea&s;ury, any &s;ums not exceeding four millions two hundred thou&s;and pounds, after the &s;everal rates of intere&s;t before propo&s;ed to be paid by the pub|lic, and one million more at three per centum per annum. They were al&s;o ve&s;ted with a power to rai&s;e money by bonds, as formerly; yet &s;o as the whole, including the annuities, &s;hould not exceed what they were by former acts impowered to bor|row.</P>
<P>The objections to the execution of this project, which by many were deemed in&s;urmountable, in|tirely vani&s;hed before the fortitude, per&s;everance&punc; and caution of the mini&s;ter; who had &s;ecured&punc; among the moneyed men of the nation, the pro|mi&s;e of &s;uch &s;ums as would have been &s;ufficient to pay off the capital belonging to tho&s;e creditors who might refu&s;e to accept the intere&s;t thus re|duced.</P>
<P>The &s;econd &s;ub&s;cription had the de&s;ired effect. The three great companies acquie&s;ced, and their example was followed by the other &s;crupulous an|nuitants:

Colonel George Town&s;hend, &s;on of the lord vi&s;count Town&s;hend, who had equally di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his civil and military accompli&s;hments, propo&s;ed another clau&s;e for preventing any non-commi&s;&s;ioned offi|cer's being broke, or reduced into the ranks; or any &s;oldier's being puni&s;hed, but by the &s;entence of a court martial.

<PB N="67" REF="680">
warm debate was the con&s;equence of this motion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1750.</NOTE> which however was over-ruled by the majority.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A bill for encou|raging the import of iron from America.</NOTE> Among other regulations made in the cour&s;e of this &s;e&s;&s;ion, for the encouragement of the Briti&s;h manufactures, a large duty was laid upon Iri&s;h &s;ail-cloth, which, being &s;old at an under-price, was found to interf$re with the &s;ame &s;pecies of commo|dity fabricated in the i&s;land of Great Britain; and, for the further benefit of this la&s;t, the bounty upon the exportation of it, which had been deducted from a defective fund, was now made payable out of the cu&s;toms. This mea&s;ure, however, was not of &s;uch importance to the nation as the act which they pa&s;&s;ed for encouraging the importation of pig and bar iron from the Briti&s;h colonies in North America.</P>
<P>Every well&punc;wi&s;her to his country reflected with concern on the nature of the Briti&s;h trade with Sweden, from which kingdom the &s;ubjects of his Britannic maje&s;ty imported more iron and &s;teel than it &s;upplied for all the other countries in Eu|rope. For this article they payed a very great bal|lance in ready money, which the Swedes again ex|pended in purcha&s;ing from the French, and other mercantile powers, tho&s;e nece&s;&s;aries and &s;uperflui|ties with which they might have been as cheaply furni&s;hed by Great Britain. In the mean time, the Engli&s;h colonies in America were re&s;tricted by &s;evere duties from making advantage of their own produce, in exchanging their iron for &s;uch com|modities as they were under the nece&s;&s;ity of pro|curing from their mother-country. Such re&s;tric|tion was not only a cruel grievance upon our own &s;ettlements, but al&s;o attended with manife&s;t preju|dice
<PB N="68" REF="690">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1750.</NOTE> to the intere&s;t of Great Britain, annually drained of great &s;ums, in favour of an ungrateful nation from which no part of them returned; whereas the iron imported from America mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity come in exchange for our own manufac|tures.</P>
<P>The commons having appointed a day for taking this affair into con&s;ideration, carefully examined into the &s;tate of the Briti&s;h commerce carried on with Sweden, as well as into the accounts of iron imported from the plantations in America; and the committee of the whole hou&s;e having re&s;olved, That the duties on American pig and bar iron &s;hould be removed, a bill was brought in for that purpo&s;e, containing a clau&s;e, however, to prevent his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects from making &s;teel, and e&s;ta|bli&s;hing mills for &s;litting and rolling iron within the Briti&s;h colonies of America; this precaution being taken, that the coloni&s;ts might not interfere with the manufactures of their mother-country.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t remarkable circum&s;tance attending the progre&s;s of this bill, which made its way thro' both hou&s;es, and obtained the royal a&s;&s;ent, was the number of contradictory petitions in favour and in prejudice of it, while it remained under con&s;idera|tion. The tanners of leather, in and about the town of Sheffield in York&s;hire, repre&s;ented, That if the bill &s;hould pa&s;s, the Engli&s;h iron would be under&s;old; con&s;equently a great number of fur|naces and forges would be di&s;continued: in that ca&s;e the woods, u&s;ed for fuel, would &s;tand uncut, and the tanners be deprived of oak-bark &s;ufficient for the continuance and &s;upport of their occupa|tion. They neverthele&s;s owned, that &s;hould the
<PB N="69" REF="700">
duty be removed from pig iron only, no &s;uch con|&s;equence<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1750.</NOTE> could be apprehended; becau&s;e, &s;hould the number of furnaces be le&s;&s;ened, that of forges would be increa&s;ed. This was likewi&s;e the plea urged in divers remon&s;trances by ma&s;ters of iron-works, gentlemen, and freeholders, who had tracts of woodland in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The owners, pro|prietors, and farmers of furnaces and iron-forges, belonging to Sheffield and its neighbourhood, en|larged upon the great expence they had incurred in erecting and &s;upporting iron-works, by means of which great numbers of his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects were comfortably &s;upported. They expre&s;&s;ed their apprehen&s;ion, that &s;hould the bill pa&s;s into a law, it could not in any degree le&s;&s;en the con&s;umption of Swedi&s;h iron, which was u&s;ed for purpo&s;es which neither the American nor Briti&s;h iron would an&s;wer: but that the propo&s;ed encouragement, con&s;idering the plenty and cheapne&s;s of wood in America, would enable the colonies to under$ell the Briti&s;h iron; a branch of traffic which would be totally de&s;troyed, to the ruin of many thou&s;and labourers, who would be compelled to &s;eek their livelihood in foreign countries. They likewi&s;e &s;ugge&s;ted, that if all the iron manufacturers of Great Britain &s;hould be obliged to depend upon a &s;upply of iron from the plantations, which mu&s;t ever be rendered precarious by the hazard of the &s;eas and the enemy, the manufactures would pro|bably decay for want of materials, and many thou|&s;and families be reduced to want and mi&s;ery. On the other hand, the ironmongers and &s;miths be|longing to the flouri&s;hing town of Birmingham in Warwick&s;hire, pre&s;ented a petition, declaring, that
<PB N="70" REF="710">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1750.</NOTE> the bill would be of great benefit to the trade of the nation, as it would enable the coloni&s;ts to make larger returns of their own produce, and encourage them to take a greater quantity of the Briti&s;h manufactures. They affirmed, that all the iron-works in the i&s;land of Great Britain did not &s;upply half the quantity of that metal &s;ufficient to carry on the manufacture; that if this deficiency could be &s;upplied from the colonies in America, the importation would cea&s;e, and con&s;iderable &s;ums of money be &s;aved to the nation. They ob&s;erved, that the importation of iron from America could no more affect the iron&punc;works and freeholders of the kingdom, than the like quantity imported from any other country: but they prayed, that the people of America might be re&s;trained from erect|ing &s;litting or rolling mills, or forges for plating iron, as they would interfere with the manufac|tures of Great Britain.</P>
<P>Many remon&s;trances to the &s;ame effect were pre&s;ented from different parts of the kingdom; and it appeared, upon the mo&s;t exact inquiry, that the encouragement of American iron would prove extremely beneficial to the kingdom, as it had been found, upon trial, applicable to all the u&s;es of Swedi&s;h iron, and as good in every re&s;pect as the produce of that country.</P>

Corre&s;ponding chambers were propo&s;ed to be erected in remote parts of North Britain, for taking in &s;ub&s;criptions, and pro&s;ecuting the trade, under the directions of the company at London; and the nation in general &s;eemed eager to di&s;pute this branch of commerce with the &s;ubjects of Hol|land, whom they con&s;idered as ungrateful inter|lopers. In the hou&s;e of peers, however, the bill met with a formidable oppo&s;ition from the earl of Winchel&s;ea and lord Sandys, who ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, That it was a crude indige&s;ted &s;cheme, which, in the execution, would never an&s;wer the expectations of the people: That in contending with the Dutch, who are the patterns of unwearied indu&s;try, and the mo&s;t rigid oeconomy, nothing could be more ab&s;urd than a joint &s;tock company, which is al|ways clogged with extraordinary expence; and the re&s;olution of fitting out ve&s;&s;els at the port of Lon|don, where all &s;orts of materials, labour, and &s;ea-men, are &s;o much dearer than in any other part of the united kingdom, exclu&s;ive of the great di&s;tance and dangerous voyage between the me|tropolis and the Sound of Bra&s;&s;a in Shetland, the rendezvous at which all the herring-bu&s;&s;es were

The&s;e objections were an&s;wered by the duke of Argyle and the earl of Granville, who &s;eemed to think that this branch of trade could not be fairly &s;et on foot, without &s;uch a con&s;iderable &s;um of money as no &s;ingle individual would care to advance; that a joint-&s;tock company would be able to pro&s;ecute the fi&s;hery at a &s;maller expence than that which particular traders mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily incur: that the pre&s;ent &s;pirit of the nation, which was eagerly bent upon trying the experiment, ought not to be baulked by delay, le&s;t it &s;hould evaporate; and that though the plan was not un|exceptionable, the defects of it might in the &s;equel be remedied by the legi&s;lature.

The &s;hock extended through the cities of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter, and was felt on both &s;ides of the river Thames, from Green|wich to the We&s;tward of London; but not percep|tible at any con&s;iderable di&s;tance.</P>
<P>On the very &s;ame day of the next month, be|tween five and &s;ix o'clock in the morning, the in|habitants of the metropolis were again affrighted by a &s;econd &s;hock more violent than the fir&s;t, and abundantly more alarming, as it waked the greater part of the people from their repo&s;e. It was pre|ceded by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of thick low fla&s;hes of light|ning, and a rumbling noi&s;e, like that of a heavy carriage rolling over a hollow pavement. The &s;hock it&s;elf con&s;i&s;ted of repeated vibrations, which la&s;ted &s;ome &s;econds, and violently &s;hook every hou&s;e from top to bottom. Again the chairs rocked, the &s;helves clattered, the &s;mall bells rung, and in &s;ome places public clocks were heard to &s;trike.

The circum|&s;tance, however, did not fail to make a deep im|pre&s;&s;ion upon ignorant, weak, and &s;uper&s;titious minds, which were the more affected by the con&s;i|deration that the two &s;hocks were periodical; that the &s;econd, which happened exactly one month af|ter the fir&s;t, had been the more violent; and that the next, increa&s;ing in proportion, might be at|tended

This<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1750.</NOTE> general notion was confirmed, and indeed propa|gated among all ranks of people, by the admoni|tions of a fanatic &s;oldier, who publickly preached up repentance, and boldly prophe&s;ied that the next &s;hock would happen on the &s;ame day of April, and totally de&s;troy the cities of London and We&s;tmin|&s;ter. Con&s;idering the infectious nature of fear and &s;uper&s;tition, and the emphatic manner in which the imagination had been prepared and prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, it is no wonder that the effu&s;ions of this illi|terate enthu&s;ia&s;t &s;hould have contributed in a great mea&s;ure to augment the general terror. The churches were crowded with penitent &s;inners: the &s;ons of riot and profligacy were overawed into &s;o|briety and decorum. The &s;treets no longer re|&s;ounded with execrations, or the noi&s;e of brutal li|centiou&s;ne&s;s; and the hand of charity was liberally opened. Tho&s;e whom fortune had enabled to re|tire from the devoted city, fled to the country with hurry and precipitation, in&s;omuch that the high|ways were encumbered with hor&s;es and carriages. Many who had, in the beginning, combated the&s;e groundle&s;s fears with the weapons of rea&s;on and ri|dicule, began in&s;en&s;ibly to imbibe the contagion, and felt their hearts fail, in proportion as the hour of probation approached: even &s;cience and philo|&s;ophy were not proof again&s;t the unaccountable effects of this communication. In after-ages it will hardly be believed, that on the evening of the eighth day of April, the open fields, that &s;kirt the metropolis, were filled with an incredible num|ber of people, a&s;&s;embled in chairs, in chai&s;es, and coaches, as well on foot, who waited in the

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plan for electing the a$ch|duke Jo|&s;eph king of the Romans.</NOTE> The attention of his Britannic maje&s;ty was not wholly engro&s;&s;ed by the di&s;putes between Ru&s;&s;ia and Sweden.

His fir&s;t and principal aim was, in conjunction with the court of Vienna, to take &s;uch mea&s;ures as would &s;ecure the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the imperial dignity to the archduke Jo&s;eph, elde&s;t &s;on and heir of the reign|ing emperor. As the previous &s;tep to that eleva|tion, it was propo&s;ed to elect this young prince king of the Romans; and for this purpo&s;e it was nece&s;&s;ary to procure a majority not only of the electors, but al&s;o in the diet of the empire, through which the propo&s;al mu&s;t have pa&s;&s;ed. No &s;tone was left unturned to reconcile this expedient to the German princes. Sub&s;idies were offered by the maritime powers of England and the States Ge|neral to the electors of Mentz and Cologne; and a treaty of the &s;ame nature was concluded with the elector of Bavaria, who, in con&s;ideration of an an|nual &s;ub&s;idy, amounting to forty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, two thirds of which to be payed by Bri|tain, and the re&s;t by the States General, engaged to keep in readine&s;s a body of &s;ix thou&s;and in|fantry, as auxiliaries to the Maritime Powers, tho' not to act again&s;t the emperor or empire; and to

<P>In order to render the king of Poland, elector of Saxony, propitious to this de&s;ign, he was ac|commodated with the loan of a very con&s;iderable &s;um, upon the mortgage of certain bailiwicks and lord&s;hips belonging to the Saxon dominions.</P>
<P>Thus a majority of the electors were &s;ecured, and &s;uch foundations laid for the &s;ucce&s;s of this project, that it was generally believed it would be accompli&s;hed in his Britannic maje&s;ty's next vi&s;it to his German dominions. Hopes (it was &s;aid) were given to the king of Sweden, that his concurrence would be gratified by erecting the hou&s;e of He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el, of which he was head, into a tenth electo|rate. Arguments of an intere&s;ting nature were u&s;ed with the king of Pru&s;&s;ia and the elector Pala|tine, that, if po&s;&s;ible, the diet might unanimou&s;ly approve of this mea&s;ure, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for e&s;tabli&s;h|ing the peace of the empire, and preventing &s;uch troubles as aro&s;e from a di&s;puted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion at the death of the &s;ixth Charles.

This monarch had &s;et him&s;elf up as a ballance to the power of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, which had long a&s;pired to ab&s;olute dominion over its co e&s;tates, and endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h an hereditary right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the empire: he therefore employed all his influence to fru&s;trate the mea&s;ure propo&s;ed, either actuated by a &s;pirit of pure patrioti&s;m, or

In order to di&s;cu&s;s tho&s;e points between the two nations, which had not been &s;ettled by the treaty of Aix-la&punc;Chapelle, conferences were al&s;o begun at Madrid, and carried on by Mr. Keene, plenipotentiary of his Britannic maje&s;ty, and Don Jo&s;eph de Carvajal and Lanca&s;tro, the Spani&s;h king's mini&s;ter. At length a treaty was concluded on the&s;e conditions: The king of Spain engaged to pay, in three months, to the South-&s;ea company of England one hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, as an indemnification for all claims upon his crown, by virtue of the A&s;&s;iento. In other re&s;pects, the

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1750.</NOTE> trade and navigation of the Engli&s;h to the ports of Spain were regulated by former treaties. It was &s;tipulated, That they &s;hould pay no other duties than tho&s;e that were exacted of them in the reign of Charles II. of Spain: That they &s;hould be treated on the footing of the mo&s;t favoured na|tions, and continue to enjoy the privilege of taking &s;alt at the i&s;land of Tortuga. But there was no article re&s;tricting the Spani&s;h guarda-co&s;tas from &s;earching the Brit &s;h ve&s;&s;els on the high &s;eas; al|though, as we have already ob&s;erved, this in&s;olent prerogative, a&s;&s;umed without right, and exerci&s;ed without humanity&punc; was, in effect, the original and &s;ole cau&s;e of the la&s;t rupture, which had been at|tended with &s;uch enormous expence to the nation. It mu&s;t be owned, however, that his Catholic ma|je&s;ty was at this period extremely well di&s;po&s;ed to live upon good terms with Great Britain. He was re&s;olved to indulge his people with the ble&s;&s;ings of peace, to propagate a &s;pirit of indu&s;try throughout his dominions, and in particular to encourage com|merce, which he fore&s;aw would prove a much more certain and inexhau&s;tible &s;ource of wealth, power, and influence, than all the trea&s;ures he could drain from the mines of Mexico and Peru. His re&s;olu|tions on this intere&s;ting &s;ubject were chiefly di|rected by Don Ricardo Wall, who now acted as his mini&s;ter at London; a gentleman who had di&s;|tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the field as well as in the cabinet, and p &s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the joint qualifications of a general and a &s;tate&s;man. He had, by virtue of a pa&s;&s;port, come over privately to England before the peace, in order to pave the way for the treaty, by a &s;ecret negotiation with the Engli&s;h mini&s;ters;
<PB N="87" REF="880">
but immediately after the peace was proclaimed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1750.</NOTE> he appeared in the character of amba&s;&s;ador. He was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the mo&s;t in&s;inuating addre&s;s, &s;hrewd, penetrating, and inqui&s;itive. While he re&s;ided in London, he &s;pared no pains in learning the nature of tho&s;e manufactures, and that com|merce, by which Great Britain had been &s;o re|markably aggrandized; and on his return to Spain, where in a little time he was placed at the helm of affairs, he turned the knowledge he had thus ac|quired to the advantage of his country. He not only promoted the u&s;eful arts within the kingdom of Spain, but demon&s;trated the infinite advantage that would accrue from an active trade, which the Spaniards had for many ages neglected; and in a few years their &s;hips were &s;een to &s;warm in all the commercial ports of Europe.</P>
<P>Of other foreign events, which di&s;tingui&s;hed this &s;ummer,' the mo&s;t remarkable was the death of John king of Portugal, who perfectly under&s;tood and &s;teadily pur&s;ued the true intere&s;t of his coun|try, and in whom many princely qualities were deba&s;ed by a cruel &s;pirit of bigotry and &s;uper&s;ti|tion. He was &s;ucceeded by his elde&s;t &s;on Jo&s;eph, who, if he has fallen &s;hort of his father in &s;ome re|&s;pects, cannot be ju&s;tly charged with having inhe|rited this paternal weakne&s;s.</P>

He told them, That, in conjunction with the Empre&s;s-queen and the States General, he had concluded a treaty with the elector of Bavaria; and was em|ployed in taking &s;uch further mea&s;ures as might be&s;t tend to &s;trengthen and &s;ecure the tranquillity of the empire, &s;upport its &s;y&s;tem, and timely anti|cipate &s;uch events as had been found by experience to endanger the common cau&s;e, involve Europe in the calamities of war, and occa&s;ion the lo&s;s of much blood and trea&s;ure to the&s;e kingdoms. He pro|mi&s;ed, That both the&s;e treaties &s;hould be &s;ubjected to their peru&s;al: he gave them to under&s;tand, That he had received from all the other contracting powers in the definitive treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, the mo&s;t full and clear declarations of their re&s;olu|tion to pre&s;erve the general peace; and that he had taken care to con&s;olidate the ties of union and friend&s;hip between him and his allies, the better to &s;ecure their mutual intere&s;ts, maintain the peace already &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, and prevent the occa&s;ion of any future rupture. Finally, he recommended unani|mity, the improvement of commerce, and the ef|fectual &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of &s;uch outrages and violences as are incon&s;i&s;tent with good order and govern|ment, and endanger the lives and properties of the &s;ubject, who&s;e happine&s;s and flouri&s;hing condition he had intirely at heart.</P>

They ob&s;erved, That nothing could be more prepo&s;terous than a blind approba|tion of mea&s;ures which they did not know: That nothing could be more ridiculous than their con|gratulations on the pre&s;ent happy tranquillity, when almo&s;t every day's news-papers informed them of &s;ome Briti&s;h &s;hip's being &s;eized by the Spaniards, or &s;ome new attack made by the French on our infant colony in Nova Scotia. With re&s;pect to the continent of Europe, they affirmed, That the tranquillity of Germany would have been upon a much more &s;olid foundation, had England never interpo&s;ed in the affairs of the Empire: in that ca&s;e the princes would of them&s;elves have &s;upported the con&s;titution of their own country: That the election of an infant for king of the Romans, was much more likely to di&s;turb than e&s;tabli&s;h the tranquillity of Europe; becau&s;e it would help to overturn the con&s;titution of the Empire, by ren|dering the imperial dignity hereditary in one hou&s;e, in&s;tead of being the re&s;ult of a free election. They took notice, that the con&s;titution had provided vicars to govern the Empire during the vacancy of the imperial throne; but had made no provi|&s;ion of regents, protectors, or guardians for a mi|nor emperor, becau&s;e it never was &s;uppo&s;ed that a minor would be cho&s;en. They inveighed again&s;t the late treaty with Spain; in which, they &s;aid, the mini&s;try, for the paultry &s;um of one hundred thou|&s;and pounds, had given up the claims of the South-&s;ea
<PB N="90" REF="910">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1750.</NOTE> company, and other Briti&s;h merchants, who had &s;uffered from depredations to the amount of one million three hundred thou&s;and pounds; and ba$t$red away the freedom of our trade and navi|gation, by leaving untouched that prerogative which the Spaniards have a&s;&s;umed of &s;earching the Briti&s;h &s;h ps in the open &s;eas&punc; and confiscating them, &s;hould they find on board the l$a&s;t particle of what they call contraband merchandize. They produced an in&s;tance of an Engli&s;h &s;hip, lately driven by &s;tre&s;s of weather into one of the ports of the Spani&s;h We&s;t Indies, where &s;he was &s;earched, &s;eized, and condemned under this pretence. They recapitulated the conduct of the French, who, in the mid&s;t of their declarations of peace and mode|ration, were &s;t$$l employed in fortifying their &s;ettle|ments on the neutral i&s;lands, as well as in harra&s;&s;ing and incroaching upon our plantations in North America. They exclaimed again&s;t the treaty of &s;ub&s;idy with the elector of Bavaria, or any other prince, in time of peace; ob&s;erving, that for &s;ome years the nation had payed &s;uch pen&s;ions to the Danes and the He&s;&s;ians; but, in the cour&s;e of the late war, the former abandoned our intere&s;ts, and the latter actually took arms again&s;t Great Britain. Finally, they affirmed, that the &s;ub&s;idy was greater than the nation could &s;pare; for, unle$s the land-tax &s;hould be continued at four &s;hillings in the pound, they could not afford a &s;hilling to any prince in Germany, without encroaching upon the &s;inking fund. "At &s;uch a juncture (&s;aid a certain member will any gentleman pre&s;ume to propo&s;e the continuation of &s;uch an impo&s;ition on the land-$older, for the &s;ake of b$$b$ng the princes of Ger|many

<P>Again&s;t the&s;e objections the motion was &s;up|ported by Mr. William Pitt, at this time an advo|cate for the mini&s;try. He ob&s;erved, That the ad|dre&s;s was no more than the u&s;ual compliment to the throne, which did not imply an obligation on the parliament to approve of mea&s;ures which they might find cau&s;e to cen&s;ure upon further inquiry. He &s;aid, the trivial di&s;putes &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between this nation and the Spaniards, or $rench, would &s;oon be terminated amicably, and could never af|fect the general tranquillity of Europe, which was to be e&s;tabli&s;hed upon a firm alliance between his maje&s;ty and &s;uch a confederacy upon the continent, as would be an over-match for the hou&s;e of Bour|bon. He expatiated upon his maje&s;ty's wi&s;dom in taking off from the French intere&s;t &s;uch a power|ful prince as the elector of Bavaria, and concert|ing other &s;alutary mea&s;ures for pre&s;erving the bal|lance or power on the continent. He de&s;ended the articles of the late treaty with Spain; ob&s;erving, that what remained of the A&s;&s;iento-contract was a matter of very little con&s;equence to the South-&s;ea company; that the demands of this company, and other Briti&s;h merchants, were all cancelled by the rupture with Spain, and more than recompen&s;ed to the nation by a great ballance of captures during

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1750.</NOTE> the war, as well as by the great traffick carried on with the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements in the We&s;t Indies, after it had been laid open by the demolition of their fortre&s;&s;es. He a&s;&s;erted, that by this treaty the court of Spain had made many important con|ce&s;&s;ions: they had conde&s;cended to pay a great &s;um to the South&punc;&s;ea company: they had con|&s;ented to the re e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Briti&s;h trade in Spain, upon a very advantageous and &s;olid foot|ing, by agreeing that the &s;ubjects of Great Britain &s;hould pay no other duties on merchandize than tho&s;e exacted of his catholic maje&s;ty's own &s;ub|jects, and to aboli&s;h all the innovations that had been introduced into the commerce. He affirmed, that the article of No Search was a &s;tipulation which it would have been ridiculous to in&s;i&s;t upon; and thought proper to obviate a reproach which he fore&s;aw the oppo&s;ition would throw upon him, from the circum&s;tance of his having&punc; upon a former occa&s;ion, heartily concurred in a motion for an ad|dre&s;s, That no treaty of peace with Spain &s;hould be admitted, unle&s;s &s;uch a &s;tipulation &s;hould be fir&s;t obtained as a preliminary. He owned he had &s;trenuou&s;ly contended for &s;uch a motion, becau&s;e at that time, being very young and &s;anguine, he thought it right and rea&s;onable: but he was now ten years older, had con&s;idered matters more cooly, and was convinced that the privilege of No Search, with re&s;pect to Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els &s;ailing near the Ame|rican &s;hore&punc; would never be obtained, unle&s;s Spain &s;hould be brought &s;o low as to acquie&s;ce in any terms we as victors might propo&s;e. He likewi&s;e &s;ignified his conviction, that all addre&s;&s;es from the hou&s;e of commons, during the cour&s;e of a war, for
<PB N="93" REF="940">
pre&s;cribing terms of peace, were in them&s;elves ridi|culous;<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1750.</NOTE> and that every &s;uch addre&s;s was an en|croachment on the king's prerogative, which had always been attended with unlucky con&s;equences.</P>
<P>How far the&s;e arguments are &s;atisfactory, con|clu&s;ive, and con&s;i&s;tent, we &s;hall leave to the rea|der's determination. Certain it is, they were adopted by the majority, and the addre&s;s was pre|&s;ented without further oppo&s;ition.</P>

When a motion was made for reducing the number of &s;eamen to eight thou|&s;and, Mr. W. Pitt, Mr. Lyttleton, and Mr. G.

The na|tion could not but be afflicted at &s;eeing a prince of &s;uch expectations ravi&s;hed from their hopes; and their grief was the better founded, as the king had already attained to an advanced age, and the heir-apparent George, now prince of Wales, was a minor.</P>

<P>This bill did not pa&s;s through the lower hou&s;e without violent debate and bitter &s;arca&s;ms.

Some of the members ventured even to in&s;inuate the danger of leaving at the head of a large &s;tand|ing army a prince of the blood, ve&s;ted with a &s;hare of the regency, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great per&s;onal in|fluence, the darling of the &s;oldiery, brave, popular, and enterpri&s;ing; &s;uppo&s;ed not wholly devoid of ambition, and not at all remarkable for any &s;ymp|toms of extraordinary affection towards the per&s;on of the heir-apparent. The hi&s;tory of England was ran&s;acked for invidious in&s;tances of royal uncles and regents, who had injured the &s;overeigns, and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed the government, by their pride, cruelty, and ambition.

The abovementioned paper, which had been con|veyed by letter to the majority of both hou&s;es, was in the month of January communicated to the lords by the duke of Marlborough, who moved for re|&s;olutions again&s;t it as a &s;editious libel, and that the concurrence of the commons might be de&s;ired.

We have already ob&s;erved, that a majority appearing on the poll for lord Trent|ham, the adherents of the other candidate, Sir George Vandeput, demanded a &s;crutiny, which was granted by the high bailiff of We&s;tmin&s;ter, the returning officer. During this tedious inve&s;ti|gation, which rolled chiefly on the qualification of voters, he acted with &s;uch addre&s;s and &s;eeming candour as gave intire &s;atisfaction to both parties, until at length he determined in favour of his lord|&s;hip, whom he returned as duly elected. Tho&s;e who &s;tiled them&s;elves the independent electors, did not acquie&s;ce in this determination without cla|mour, reproach, menaces, and riot. They taxed Mr. Leigh the high bailiff with partiality and in|ju&s;tice: they loudly affirmed, that mini&s;terial in|fluence had been u&s;ed in the mo&s;t &s;candalous man|ner; and, finally, joined Sir George Vandeput in a

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1751.</NOTE> petition to the lower hou&s;e, complaining of an undue election and return of a member for the city of We&s;tmin&s;ter. The commons, in&s;tead of inquiring into the merits of the&s;e petitions, ordered them to lie upon the table; and, without any com|plaint from any per&s;on whatever, a motion was made, that Leigh the high bailiff &s;hould attend the hou&s;e immediately, in order to make them ac|quainted with what he had done in pur&s;uance to the directions he had formerly received from that hou&s;e, touching the execution of the writ for elect|ing a new member to repre&s;ent the city of We&s;t|min&s;ter. As this motion had been preconcerted, Leigh was attending in the lobby, and imme|diately called into the hou&s;e to be examined on this &s;ubject. Having, in the cour&s;e of his examina|tion, alledged, that the election had been pro|tracted by affected delays, he was a&s;ked by whom, and by what means; but, before he could an&s;wer, the earl of Egmont, interpo&s;ing, objected to the que&s;tion as improper, and moved for the order of the day. A debate immediately en&s;ued, in which the impropriety of the que&s;tion was demon&s;trated by Mr. Henley, now lord&punc;keeper, Dr. Lee, and &s;ome others, the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible and moderate members of the hou&s;e: but they were oppo&s;ed with great vio|lence by the lord vi&s;count Coke, Henry Fox, E&s;q; Sir William Yonge, colonel Lyttleton, and the weight of the mini&s;try; &s;o that the motion for the order of the day was carried in the negative, and the high bailiff required to an&s;wer the que&s;tion. Thus inter|rogated, he declared, that he had been impeded in the &s;crutiny, and mal-treated, by Mr. Crowle, who had acted as coun&s;el for Sir George Vandeput, by the

honourable Alexander Murray, brother to lord Eli|bank,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1751.</NOTE> and one Gib&s;on, an uphol&s;terer, who had been very active, zealous, and turbulent in his en|deavours to promote the intere&s;t of Sir George Vandeput, or rather to thwart the preten&s;ions of the other candidate, who was &s;uppo&s;ed to be coun|tenanced by the mini&s;try. The&s;e three per&s;ons, thus accu&s;ed, were brought to the bar of the hou&s;e, notwith&s;tanding the &s;trenuous remon&s;trances of &s;e|veral members, who oppo&s;ed this method of pro|ceeding as a &s;pecies of oppre&s;&s;ion equally arbitrary and ab&s;urd. They ob&s;erved, that, as no complaint had been preferred, they had no right to take cog|nizance of the affair: that if any undue influence had been u&s;ed, it would naturally appear when the merits of the election &s;hould fall under their in|quiry: that a complaint having been lodged al|ready again&s;t the returning officer, it was their duty to inve&s;tigate his conduct, and puni&s;h him, if he &s;hould be found delinquent; but that nothing could be more flagrantly unju&s;t, and apparently partial, than their neglecting the petitions of the other candidate and electors, and encouraging the high bailiff, who &s;tood charged with iniquity, to recriminate upon his accu&s;ers, that they might be di&s;abled from giving evidence on the inquiry into the merits of the election. What difference is it to the &s;ubject, whether he is oppre&s;&s;ed by an arbitrary prince, or by the de&s;potic in&s;olence of a mini&s;terial majority?</P>
<P>Mr. Crowle alledged, in his own vindication, that he had been employed as a coun&s;el by the electors of We&s;tmin&s;ter, and attended the &s;crutiny in that character; that after the high bailiff had,

Some evidences being examined again&s;t him, declared he had not only protracted the &s;cru|tiny, but al&s;o &s;poken di&s;re&s;pectful words of the honourable hou&s;e of commons: he was therefore reprimanded on his knees by the &s;peaker, and di&s;|charged.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. Mur|ray &s;ent pri&s;oner to New|gate.</NOTE> Mr. Murray being charged with having uttered &s;ome threatening and affrontive expre&s;&s;ions, the hou&s;e adjourned the con&s;ideration of this affair for &s;ome days, at the expiration of which Mr. Murray was to be heard by his coun&s;el: but, in the mean time, they ordered him to be taken into cu&s;tody by the &s;erjeant at arms attending the hou&s;e. This &s;tep, however, was not taken without a warm op|po&s;ition by &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;edate and intelligent members of the hou&s;e, who con&s;idered it as a cruel act of oppre&s;&s;ion. They ob&s;erved, that in ca&s;es of breach of privilege, no per&s;on complained of was ever taken into cu&s;tody, until after he had been &s;ully heard in his defence: that this was literally prejudging the cau&s;e before it had been examined; and the oppre&s;&s;ion was the greater as the alledged offence con&s;i&s;ted intirely of words, of which no complaint or information had been made for above eight months after the &s;uppo&s;ed offence had been committed; and, even then, not till an accu&s;ation had been lodged again&s;t the informant, upon the

trial of which accu&s;ation the per&s;ons informed<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1751.</NOTE> again&s;t might very probably be the mo&s;t material witne&s;&s;es. They ob&s;erved, that in one of the high|e&s;t offences which can be committed by words, namely, that of denying the king's right to the crown, or renouncing the Trinity, the information mu&s;t be brought in three or four days after the words are &s;poken; the words mu&s;t be proved to have been &s;poken maliciou&s;ly, directly, and ad|vi&s;edly, and the pro&s;ecution mu&s;t commence in three months after the information. The&s;e &s;ug|ge&s;tions made no more impre&s;&s;ion than if they had been uttered in the de&s;ert. Tho&s;e who were &s;e|cure in their number a&s;&s;erted, that the hou&s;e of commons was not re&s;tricted by the forms of pro|ceeding at common law; and that it was nece&s;&s;ary to vindicate their own honour and dignity, by making examples of tho&s;e who &s;eemed to hold them in contempt. Mr. Murray was committed to the cu&s;tody of the &s;erjeant at arms, and found bail; and Gib&s;on was &s;ent pri&s;oner to Newgate, from whence he was in a few days relea&s;ed, upon pre&s;enting an humble petition, profe&s;&s;ing his &s;or|row for having incurred the di&s;plea&s;ure of the hou&s;e; to the bar of which he was brought, and received a reprimand on his knees from the &s;peaker.</P>
<P>In the mean time, divers witne&s;&s;es being exa|mined before the hou&s;e, declared, That Mr. Mur|ray had been &s;een, about the time of the return of a member for We&s;tmin&s;ter, heading and exciting a tumult to acts of violence again&s;t the high bai|liff.

Then, in the clo&s;e of another vio|lent debate, they re&s;olved, That he &s;hould be brought to the bar of the hou&s;e, to receive that &s;en|tence on his knees. He accordingly appeared, and being directed by the &s;peaker to kneel, refu&s;ed to comply. He knew that he could not be di&s;|charged from Newgate during the &s;e&s;&s;ion, without petitioning, acknowledging his offence, and making &s;uch conce&s;&s;ions as he thought would imply a con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt: he con&s;idered this whole tran&s;|action as an oppre&s;&s;ive exertion of arbitrary power, and, being apprized of the extent of their autho|rity, determined to bear the brunt of their indigna|tion, rather than make &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions which he deemed beneath the dignity of his character. When he refu&s;ed to humble him&s;elf, the whole hou&s;e was in commotion: he was no &s;ooner re|moved from the bar than they re&s;olved, That his having, in a mo&s;t in&s;olent and audacious manner, refu&s;ed to be on his knees at the bar of that hou&s;e, in con&s;equence of their former re&s;olution, was an high and mo&s;t dangerous contempt of the autho|rity and privilege of the commons: it was therefore ordered, that he &s;hould be committed clo&s;e pri|&s;oner to Newgate, debarred the u&s;e of pen, ink, and paper; and that no per&s;on &s;hould have acce&s;s to him, without the leave of the hou&s;e.

<P>Mr. Murray being taken dangerou&s;ly ill in New|gate, application was made to the commons, by &s;ome of his relations, that he might be removed to a more convenient &s;ituation; and his phy&s;ician, being examined, gave it as his opinion, that he was in|fected with the gaol di&s;temper. Upon this repre|&s;entation the hou&s;e agreed, that the &s;peaker &s;hould i&s;&s;ue a warrant for removing him from Newgate to the cu&s;tody of the &s;erjeant at arms; but this favour he refu&s;ed to accept, and expre&s;&s;ed the warme&s;t re&s;entment again&s;t tho&s;e relations who had applied to the commons in his behalf. Thus he remained &s;eque&s;tered, even from his own brother and &s;i&s;ter, under the di&s;plea&s;ure of the commons of England, who conde&s;cended &s;o far as to make re&s;olutions touching the phy&s;ician, apothecary, and nur&s;e who attended this pri&s;oner. But the prorogation of parliament having put an end to their authority for that &s;e&s;&s;ion, Mr. Murray was di&s;charged of cour&s;e, and conducted by the &s;heriffs from Newgate to his own hou&s;e in proce&s;&s;ion, with flags and &s;treamers exhibiting the emblems of liberty.</P>

<P>This reply he circulated among the electors, and in particular tran&s;mitted it to the king of Great Britain, de&s;iring they would deliberate maturely on this &s;ubject, and confer together in a body as well as in private, that they might proceed according to the antient cu&s;tom of the electoral college, and take &s;uch mea&s;ures as &s;hould be judged expedient for the honour and advantage of the community.</P>
<P>This circular letter was an&s;wered both by the king of England and the elector of Bavaria, who demon&s;trated, that it was the privilege of the elec|toral college only, without any participation of the other princes of the Empire, to elect a king of the Romans during the life of the emperor, in order

to maintain the peace and pre&s;erve the liberties of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1751.</NOTE> Germany; and that the neglect of this wi&s;e pre|caution hath produced bloody wars, and many fatal con&s;equences to the Empire. They ob&s;erved, that nothing could more contribute to the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the public tranquillity than this mea&s;ure, &s;o ardently de&s;ired by the majority of the German princes; and that, although the archduke Jo&s;eph wanted a few years of being of age, and it might po&s;&s;ibly happen that the reigning Emperor &s;hould die during that prince's minority, it would be much le&s;s prejudicial to the Empire to have a minor chief, than to &s;ee the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion altogether un|&s;ettled.</P>
<P>To the &s;ame purpo&s;e his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty re|ceived a declaration from the elector of Mentz; and under&s;tanding that this prince, as arch-chan|cellor of the Empire, intended to convoke an electoral diet, in order to propo&s;e the election of the king of the Romans, he wrote an elaborate letter to his electoral highne&s;s, explaining, at more length, his rea&s;ons for po&s;tponing the election. He quoted that &s;entence of the treaty of We&s;tpha|lia which expre&s;ly declares, that the election of a king of the Romans &s;hall be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed and ordained by the common con&s;ent of the &s;tates of the Em|pire; and therefore he could not conceive what right the electoral college had to arrogate this pri|vilege to them&s;elves, excluding the other &s;tates of the Empire. He ob&s;erved, that the Imperial capi|tulations, which were the only laws of the Empire that treated of this &s;ubject, mentioned only three ca&s;es in which it was lawful to proceed to &s;uch an election; namely, the Emperor's leaving and long

He affirmed, that none of the&s;e motives at pre&s;ent exi&s;ted: that, in ca&s;e the Imperial crown &s;hould devolve to a minor, many mi&s;chiefs and di&s;orders mu&s;t en&s;ue, as the con&s;titu|tions of the Empire have e&s;tabli&s;hed no regula|tions nor regency in that event: that an election of this nature, carried on under the power, influence, and authority of the head of the Empire, would &s;trike at the fundamental privileges of the princes and &s;tates; con&s;equently in time overturn the con|&s;titution of the Empire, which, from being an elective dignity, conferred by the free and inde|pendent &s;uffrages of the electoral college and &s;tates of Germany, under certain capitulations, obliging the prince thus cho&s;en to govern according to law, would become an hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, perpe|tuated in one family, which, of cour&s;e, mu&s;t be aggrandized to the prejudice of its co-e&s;tates, and the ruin of the Germanic liberties.</P>
<P>In a word, all Germany in general, and Ratisbon in particular, was filled with writings, publi&s;hed on both &s;ides: by the Emperor, and his adherents, to demon&s;trate, that the election of a king of the Romans, during the life of the Emperor, had often happened; and at this pre&s;ent time was nece&s;&s;ary, and would be advantageous to the Empire: while the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, and his friends, laboured to prove, that &s;uch an election, at the pre&s;ent junc|ture, would be ill timed, irregular, and of danger|ous con&s;equence. Perhaps, if the truth was known,

this enterpri&s;ing prince had projected &s;ome great<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1751&punc;</NOTE> &s;cheme, with the execution of which this propo&s;ed e&s;tabli&s;hment would have interfered.

Their joint endeavours were &s;o effectual, that the elector of Cologne renounced his &s;ub&s;idiary treaty with the $span$ and once more threw him&s;elf into the arms of France. The elector Palatine, being &s;ollicited by the Empre&s;s-queen and his Bri|tannic maje&s;ty to co-operate with their views, in|&s;i&s;ted, as a preliminary article, upon being indem|nified by the court of Vienna for the ravages com|mitted in his territories by the Au&s;trian troops, during the cour&s;e of the la&s;t war: the king of Po|land, elector of Saxony, made the &s;ame demand of the like indemnification, which was granted by the mediation of king George; and then he &s;ub&s;cribed to a &s;ub&s;idy-treaty, obliging him&s;elf to furni&s;h a body of &s;ix thou&s;and auxiliaries, in ca&s;e they &s;hould be required by the Maritime Powers; and to act, as elector, in concert with the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, in every thing relating to the welfare of his country, that &s;hould &s;quare with the fundamental laws of the Empire.</P>
<P>The courts of London and Vienna had this election &s;o much at heart, that they &s;ounded almo&s;t all the powers of Europe, to know how they &s;tood affected towards the mea&s;ure propo&s;ed.

Nothing could be more &s;alutary than the purpo&s;es of the&s;e regulations. The &s;uburbs of the metropolis abounded with an incredible number of public hou&s;es, that continu|ally re&s;ounded with the noi&s;e of riot and intempe|rance: they were the haunts of idlene&s;s, fraud, and rapine; and the &s;eminaries of drunkenne&s;s, debauchery, extravagance, and every vice incident to human nature: yet the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the&s;e re|ceptacles of infamy was attended with an inconve|nience, which, in &s;ome ca&s;es, aro&s;e even to a degree of oppre&s;&s;ion.

<P>The law relating to the Highlands of Scotland was well calculated for promoting, among the in|habitants of that country, &s;uch a &s;pirit of indu&s;try

It was al&s;o provided, that no lea&s;e &s;hould be granted for a longer term than twenty-one years; and that the le&s;&s;ees &s;hould not pay above three-fourths of the annual value.</P>
<P>Although the&s;e forfeited e&s;tates were generally encumbered with claims beyond their real value, and the act directed that they &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed of by public &s;ale; yet, as they lay in the mo&s;t di&s;|affected parts of the Highlands, it was thought ne|ce&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould remain in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the crown, becau&s;e, in ca&s;e of their being publicly &s;old, they might be purcha&s;ed in tru&s;t for the fami|lies of the per&s;ons by whom they were forfeited, and thus the &s;pirit of di&s;affection would &s;till &s;ur|vive. A valuation, therefore, was made by the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion in Scotland, at the joint &s;uit of the crown and the creditors; and the value being a&s;|certained, the ju&s;t claimants were, to that amount, paid out of the next aids granted by parliament.</P>

What, for ex|ample, can be more repugnant to the fundamental principles of ju&s;tice, as well as to the &s;agacity of civil regulation, than the undi&s;tingui&s;hing in&s;titu|tion which decrees the &s;ame penalty again&s;t the felon who robs his neighbour of five &s;hillings, and the execrable homicide who murders his benefac|tor?

This objection, however, was a meer conjecture, un&s;upported by evidence and expe|rience, and not very plau&s;ible in point of probabi|lity.

Though formerly countenanced, and even treated as a &s;overeign prince by the Briti&s;h mini|&s;try, he was now reduced to the forlorn condition of a confined debtor; and, to the reproach of this kingdom, died in pri&s;on, &s;urrounded with all the mi&s;ery of indigence, and overwhelmed with the infirmities of old age.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t remarkable circum&s;tance of the parliamentary tran&s;actions that di&s;tingui&s;hed this &s;e&s;&s;ion, was a motion made in both hou&s;es for an addre&s;s to the king, be&s;eeching his maje&s;ty, That, in time of public tranquillity, he would be graci|ou&s;ly plea&s;ed to avoid entering into &s;ub&s;idiary trea|ties with foreign princes, which are &s;o burthen&s;ome to this nation.

The&s;e devolved to the king of Pru&s;&s;ia with this incum|brance, and he continued to pay the intere&s;t punc|tually till this juncture, when the payment was &s;topped; and he publi&s;hed a paper, intituled, An Expo&s;ition of the Motives which influenced his Conduct on this Occa&s;ion. In his memorial to the mini&s;try of Great Britain he alledged, That eigh|teen Pru&s;&s;ian &s;hips, and thirty-three neutral ve&s;&s;els, in which the &s;ubjects of Pru&s;&s;ia were concerned, had been unju&s;tly &s;eized by Engli&s;h privateers: his account of damages amounted to a very con&s;i|derable &s;um; and he demanded, in the mo&s;t dog|matic terms, that the affair &s;hould be finally di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed in the term of three months from the date of his remon&s;trance. The Expo&s;ition and Memo|rial were &s;ubjected to the examination of the able&s;t civilians in England, who refuted ever article of the charge with equal preci&s;ion and per&s;picuity. They proved, that captures by &s;ea fell properly un|der the cognizance of tho&s;e powers under who&s;e juri&s;diction the &s;eizures were made; and, therefore, his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty could not, con&s;i&s;tent with the law of nations, determine the&s;e di&s;putes in his own tribunals.

They wound up their chain of rea&s;oning by ob&s;erving, that, according to agreement with the Emperor, the whole of this loan &s;hould have been repayed in the year one thou|&s;and &s;even hundred and forty-five; whereas the complaints &s;pecified in the Pru&s;&s;ian memorial were founded on facts po&s;terior to that period.</P>

<P>The court of Vienna, and the Maritime Powers, finding him thus ob&s;tinately attached to his own intere&s;t, re&s;olved to bring him over to their views at any rate, and commenced a negotiation with him, which produced a formal treaty.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bill for prevent|ing the plunder|ing of &s;hip|wrecked ve&s;&s;els.</NOTE> In order the more effectually to repre&s;s the bar|barous practice of plundering &s;hips, which have the misfortune to &s;uffer &s;hipwreck; a practice which prevailed upon many different parts of the Briti&s;h coa&s;t, to the di&s;grace of the nation, and the &s;candal of human nature; a bill was prepared, containing clau&s;es to enforce the laws again&s;t &s;uch &s;avage delinquents, who prowl along the &s;hore, like hungry wolves, in hope of preying upon their fellow-creatures; and certain provi&s;ions for the relief of the unhappy &s;ufferers. By this new law the clerk of the peace, in the county where the crime &s;hall be committed, is obliged, upon re|ceiving proper information, to pro&s;ecute the of|fenders at the expence of the county. It was like|wi&s;e propo&s;ed, that in ca&s;e no pro&s;ecution of this nature &s;hould be commenced within a certain limited time, after the information &s;hould have been legally given, in that ca&s;e the county might be &s;ued by the per&s;on who had &s;u&s;tained the da|mage, and obliged to indemnify him for his lo&s;s: but this clau&s;e was rejected by the majority; and the bill, having made its way through both hou&s;es, received the royal a&s;&s;ent.</P>

A bill was accordingly brought in, importing, That intere&s;t, after the rate of three per centum, &s;hould be allowed upon every debenture for the bounty on the exportation of corn, payable by the general receiver or ca&s;hier of the cu&s;toms, until the principal could be di&s;charged out of &s;uch cu&s;toms or duties as are appropriated for the payment of this bounty. This premium on the exportation of corn ought not to be grant|ed, except when the lowne&s;s of the market-price in Great Britain proves that there is a &s;uperabundance in the kingdom; otherwi&s;e the exporter will find his account in depriving our own labourers of their bread, in order to &s;upply our rivals at an ea&s;ier rate: for example, &s;uppo&s;e wheat in England &s;hould &s;ell for twenty &s;hillings a quarter, the merchant might export it to France, and afford it to the people of that kingdom for eighteen &s;hillings, becau&s;e the bounty on exportation would, even at that rate, afford him a con&s;iderable advantage.</P>

Such a mea&s;ure had been twice before propo&s;ed without &s;ucce&s;s; but now it was adopted without oppo&s;ition. A bill was immediately introduced; and, notwith&s;tanding all the intere&s;t and efforts of the Turkey company, who petitioned the hou&s;e again&s;t it, and were heard by their coun&s;el, it pa&s;&s;ed through both hou&s;es, and received the royal &s;anc|tion. By this regulation any Briti&s;h &s;ubject may obtain the freedom of the Turkey company, by paying or tendering a fine of twenty pounds; and all the members are &s;ecured from the tyranny of oppre&s;&s;ive bye-laws, contrived by any monopo|lizing cabal. This indulgence, however, and even all the encouragement which the legi&s;lature can be&s;tow, will never retrieve the trade of Turkey or the Levant, while the heavy load of taxes di&s;ables the manufacturer from affording his commodity &s;o cheap as it can be &s;upplied by our rivals in com|merce, who neither groan under &s;uch burthens, nor pay &s;uch a price for labour.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Naturali|zation of the Jews.</NOTE> But this &s;e&s;&s;ion was chiefly di&s;tingui&s;hed by an act for naturalizing Jews, and a bill for the better pre|venting clande&s;tine mar$iages. The fir&s;t of the&s;e, which pa&s;&s;ed without much oppo&s;ition in the hou&s;e of lords, from whence it de&s;cended to the commons, was intituled, "An Act to permit Per&s;ons profe&s;&s;|ing the Jewi&s;h religion to be naturalized by Parlia|ment, and for other Purpo&s;es therein mentioned." It was &s;upported by &s;ome petitions of merchants and manufacturers, who, upon examination, ap|peared to be Jews, or their dependants; and coun|tenanced by the mini&s;try, who thought they fore|&s;aw, in the con&s;equences of &s;uch a naturalization, a great acce&s;&s;ion to the moneyed intere&s;t, and a con|&s;iderable increa&s;e of their own influence among the individuals of that community. They boldly af|firmed, that &s;uch a law would greatly conduce to the advantage of the nation; that it would encou|rage per&s;ons of wealth to remove with their effects from foreign parts into Great Britain, increa&s;e the commerce and the credit of the kingdom, and &s;et a laudable example of indu&s;try, temperance, and frugality. Such, however, were not the &s;enti|ments of the lord-mayor, aldermen, and commons of the city of London in common council a&s;&s;em|bled, who, in a petition to parliament, expre&s;&s;ed their apprehen&s;ion that the bill, if pa&s;&s;ed into a law, would tend greatly to the di&s;honour of the chri&s;tian religion, endanger the excellent con&s;titu|tion, and be highly prejudicial to the intere&s;t and trade of the kingdom in general, and of the city of
<PB N="143" REF="1450">
London in particular. To the &s;ame purpo&s;e an|other<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> petition was next day pre&s;ented to the hou&s;e, &s;ub&s;cribed by merchants and traders of the city of London; who, among other allegations, ob&s;erved, that the con&s;equences of &s;uch a naturalization would greatly affect their trade and commerce with foreign nations, particularly with Spain and Portugal. Coun&s;el was heard, evidence examined, and the bill produced violent debates, in which there &s;eemed to be more pa&s;&s;ion than patrioti&s;m, more declamation than argument.</P>
<P>The adver&s;aries of the bill affirmed, that &s;uch a naturalization would deluge the kingdom with brokers, u&s;urers, and beggars; that the rich Jews, under the &s;hadow of this indulgence, would pur|cha&s;e lands, and even advow&s;ons; &s;o as not only to acquire an intere&s;t in the legi&s;lature, but al&s;o to influence the con&s;titution of the church of Chri&s;t, to which they were the inveterate and pro|fe&s;&s;ed enemies: that the lower cla&s;s of that nation, when thus admitted to the right of deni&s;ons, would interfere with the indu&s;trious natives, who earn their livelihood by their labour; and by dint of the mo&s;t par&s;imonious frugality, to which the Engli&s;h are &s;trangers, work at an under-price; &s;o as not only to &s;hare, but even in a manner to exclude them from all employment: that &s;uch an adoption of vagrant Jews into the community, from all parts of the world, would rob the real &s;ubjects of their birthright, di&s;grace the character of the nation, ex|po&s;e them&s;elves to the mo&s;t di&s;honourable partici|pation and intru&s;ion, endanger the con&s;titution both in church and &s;tate, and be an indelible reproach upon the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of the country. Some

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> of the&s;e orators &s;eemed tran&s;ported even to a degree of enthu&s;ia&s;m. They progno&s;ticated that the Jews would multiply &s;o much in number, engro&s;s &s;uch wealth, and acquire &s;o great power and influence in Great Britain, that their per&s;ons would be revered, their cu&s;toms imitated, and Judai&s;m become the fa&s;hionable religion of the Engli&s;h. Finally, they affirmed that &s;uch an act was directly flying in the face of the prophecy, which declares, that the Jews &s;hall be a &s;cattered people, without country or fixed habitation, until they &s;hall be converted from their infidelity, and gathered together in the land of their forefathers. The&s;e arguments and appre|hen&s;ions, which were in reality frivolous and chi|merical, being indu&s;triou&s;ly circulated among the vulgar, naturally prejudiced again&s;t the Jewi&s;h peo|ple, excited &s;uch a ferment throughout the nation, as ought to have deterred the mini&s;try from the pro&s;ecution of &s;uch an unpopular mea&s;ure; which, however, they had courage enough to maintain again&s;t all oppo&s;ition. The bill pa&s;&s;ed the ordeal of both hou&s;es, and his maje&s;ty vouch&s;afed the royal &s;anction to this law in favour of the Hebrew nation. The truth is, it might have increa&s;ed the wealth, and extended the commerce of Great Britain, had it been agreeable to the people; and as the natu|ralized Jews would &s;till have been excluded from all civil and military offices, as well as from other privileges enjoyed by their chri&s;tian brethren, in all probability, they would have gradually for&s;aken their own unprofitable and ob&s;tinate infidelity, opened their eyes to the &s;hining truths of the go&s;|pel, and joined their fellow-&s;ubjects in embracing the doctrines of Chri&s;tianity. But no mini&s;try

ought to ri&s;k an experiment, how plau&s;ible &s;oever<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753&punc;</NOTE> it may be, if they find it, as this was, an object of the people's unconquerable aver&s;ion. What render|ed this unpopular mea&s;ure the more impolitic, was the un&s;ea&s;onable juncture at which it was carried into execution; that is, at the eve of a general elec|tion for a new parliament; when a mini&s;ter ought carefully to avoid every &s;tep which may give um|brage to the body of the people. The earl of Eg&mdash;t, who argued again&s;t the bill with equal power and vivacity, in de&s;cribing the effect it might have upon that occa&s;ion, "I am amazed, (&s;aid he) that this con&s;ideration makes no impre&s;|&s;ion.&mdash;When that day, which is not far off, &s;hall arrive, I &s;hall not &s;ear to &s;et my foot upon any ground of election in the kingdom, in oppo&s;ition to any one man among you, or any new Chri&s;tian who has voted or appeared in favour of this natu|ralization."</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar$$$ge$ act.</NOTE> Another bill, tran&s;mitted from the upper-hou&s;e, met with a reception equally unfavourable among the commons, though it was &s;u&s;tained on the &s;houlders of the majority, and thus forced its way to the throne, where it obtained the royal appro|bation. The practice of &s;olemnizing clande&s;tine marriages, &s;o prejudicial to the peace of families, and &s;o often productive of mi&s;ery to the parties them&s;elves thus united, was an evil that prevailed to &s;uch a degree, as claimed the attention of the legi&s;lature. The &s;ons and daughters of great and opulent families, before they had acquired know|ledge and experience, or attained to the years of di&s;cretion, were every day &s;educed in their affec|tions, and inveigled into matches big with infamy
<PB N="146" REF="1480">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> and ruin; and the&s;e were greatly facilitated by the opportunities that occurred of being united in|&s;tantaneou&s;ly by the ceremony of marriage, in the fir&s;t tran&s;port of pa&s;&s;ion, before the de&s;tined victim had time to cool or deliberate on the &s;ubject. For this pernicious purpo&s;e there was a band of profligate mi&s;creants, the refu&s;e of the clergy, dead to every &s;entiment of virtue, abandoned to all &s;en&s;e of decency and decorum, for the mo&s;t part pri&s;oners for debt or delinquency, and indeed the very outca&s;ts of human &s;ociety, who hovered about the verge of the Fleet-pri&s;on to intercept cu&s;tomers, plying like porters for employment, and performed the ceremony of marriage without li|cence or que&s;tion; in cellars, garrets, or alehou&s;es, to the &s;candal of religion, and the di&s;grace of that order which they profe&s;&s;ed. The ea&s;e with which this eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;anction was obtained, and the vicious di&s;po&s;ition of tho&s;e wretches, open to the practices of fraud and corruption, were productive of polygamy, indigence, conjugal infidelity, pro|&s;titution, and every cur&s;e that could imbitter the married &s;tate.</P>
<P>A remarkable ca&s;e of this nature having fallen under the cognizance of the peers, in an appeal from an inferior tribunal, that hou&s;e ordered the judges to prepare a new bill for preventing &s;uch abu&s;es; and one was accordingly framed, under the au&s;pices of lord H&mdash;, at that time lord high chancellor of England. In order to antici|pate the bad effects of clande&s;tine marriages, this new &s;tatute enacted, That the banns &s;hould be re|gularly publi&s;hed, three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Sundays, in the church of the pari&s;h where the parties dwell:

<P>The bill, when fir&s;t con&s;idered in the lower hou&s;e, gave ri&s;e to a variety of debates; in which the members appeared to be divided rather accord|ing
<PB N="148" REF="1510">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> to their real &s;entiments, than by the rules of any political di&s;tinction: for &s;ome principal &s;ervants of the government freely differed in opinion from the mini&s;ter, who countenanced the bill; while, on the other hand, he was, on this occa&s;ion, &s;upported by certain chiefs of the oppo&s;ition, and the di&s;putes were maintained with extraordinary eagerne&s;s and warmth. The principal objections imported, that &s;uch re&s;trictions on marriage would damp the &s;pi|rit of love and propagation; promote mercenary matches, to the ruin of dome&s;tic happine&s;s, as well as to the prejudice of po&s;terity and population; impede the circulation of property, by pre&s;erving the wealth of the kingdom among a kind of ari&s;to|cracy of opulent families, who would always inter|marry within their own pale; &s;ubject the poor to many inconveniences, and extraordinary expence, from the nature of the forms to be ob&s;erved; and throw an additional power into the hands of the chancellor. They affirmed, that no human power had a right to di&s;&s;olve a vow &s;olemnly made in the fight of heaven; and that, in proportion as the bill prevented clande&s;tine marriages it would en|courage fornication and debauchery, ina&s;much as the parties re&s;trained from indulging their mutual pa&s;&s;ions in an honourable manner, would be tempt|ed to gratify them by &s;tealth, at the hazard of their reputation. In a word, they fore&s;aw a great num|ber of evils in the train of this bill, which have not yet been realized. On the other &s;ide, its advo|cates endeavoured to refute the&s;e arguments, and &s;ome of them &s;poke with great &s;trength and preci|&s;ion. The bill underwent a great number of alte|rations and amendments, which were not effected

<P>Certain it is, the abu&s;e of clande&s;tine marriage might have been removed upon much ea&s;ier terms than tho&s;e impo&s;ed upon the &s;ubject by this bill&punc; which, after all, hath been found ineffectual, as it may be ea&s;ily eluded by a &s;hort voyage to the con|tinent, or a moderate journey to North Britain, where the indi&s;&s;oluble knot may be tied without &s;cruple or interruption.</P>

and certainly determine whether a general naturali|zation<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> would be advantageous or prejudicial to the community; that it would decide what number of men might, on any &s;udden emergency, be levied for the defence of the kingdom; and whether the nation is gainer or lo&s;er by &s;ending its natives to &s;ettle, and our troops to defend di&s;tant colonies; that it would be the means of e&s;tabli&s;hing a local admini&s;tration of civil government, or a police upon certain fixed principles, the want of which hath been long a reproach to the nation, a &s;ecurity to vice, and an encouragement to idlene&s;s; that in many ca&s;es, where all other evidence is wanting, it would enable &s;uitors to recover their right in courts of ju&s;tice, facilitate an equal and equitable a&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ment in rai&s;ing the pre&s;ent taxes, and laying future impo&s;itions; &s;pecify the lineal de&s;cents, relations, and alliances of families; lighten the intolerable bur|thens incurred, by the public, from innumerable and ab&s;urd regulations relating to the poor; pro|vide for them by a more equal exertion of huma|nity, and effectually &s;creen them from all ri&s;que of peri&s;hing by hunger, cold, cruelty, and oppre&s;&s;ion. Whether &s;uch a law would have an&s;wered the &s;an|guine expectations of its patron, we &s;hall not pre|tend to determine; though, in our opinion, it mu&s;t have been attended with very &s;alutary con&s;e|quences, particularly in re&s;training the hand of robbery and violence, in detecting fraud, bridling the ferocity of a licentious people, and e&s;tabli&s;hing a happy &s;y&s;tem of order and &s;ubordination.

<P>The genius of the Engli&s;h people is perhaps in|compatible with a &s;tate of perfect tranquillity: if it is not ruffled by foreign provocations, or agitated by unpopular mea&s;ures of dome&s;tic admini&s;tration, it will undergo temporary fermentations from the turbulent ingredients inherent in its own con&s;titu|tion. Tumults are excited, and factions kindled into rage and inveteracy, by incidents of the mo&s;t frivolous nature. At this juncture the metropolis of England was divided and di&s;compo&s;ed, in a &s;ur|pri&s;ing manner, by a di&s;pute in it&s;elf of &s;o little con&s;equence to the community, that it could not de&s;erve a place in a general hi&s;tory, if it did not &s;erve to convey a characteri&s;tic idea of the Eng|li&s;h<NOTE PLACE="marg">Remark|able &s;tory of Eliza|beth Canning.</NOTE> nation.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the year an ob&s;cure dam&s;el, of low degree, who&s;e name was Elizabeth Can|ning, promulgated a report, which, in a little time, attracted the attention of the public. She affirmed, that on the fir&s;t day of the new year, at night, &s;he was &s;eized under Bedlam-wall by two ruffians, who, having &s;tripped her of her upper-apparel, &s;ecured

Here &s;he remained a whole month, without any other &s;u&s;tenance than a few &s;tale cru&s;ts of bread, and about a gallon of water; till at length &s;he forced her way through a window, and ran home to her mother's hou&s;e, almo&s;t naked, in the night of the twenty-ninth of January.</P>
<P>This &s;tory, improbable and un&s;upported, ope|rated &s;o &s;trongly on the pa&s;&s;ions of the people in the neighbourhood of Aldermanbury, where Can|ning's mother lived, and particularly among fana|tics of all denominations, that they rai&s;ed volun|tary contributions with &s;urpri&s;ing eagerne&s;s, in order to bring the &s;uppo&s;ed delinquents to ju&s;tice. Warrants were granted for apprehending Wells, who kept the hou&s;e at Enfield-wa&s;h, and her ac|complices, the &s;ervant-maid, who&s;e name was Vir|tue Hall, and one Squires, an old gip&s;ey-woman, who was charged by Canning with having robbed her of her &s;tays. Wells, tho' acquitted of the felony, was puni&s;hed as a bawd. Hall turned evidence for Canning, but afterwards recanted; and Squires, the gip&s;ey, was convicted of the robbery, altho' &s;he pro|duced undoubted evidence to prove that &s;he was at Abbot&s;bury in Dor&s;et&s;hire that very night in which the felony was &s;aid to be committed; and Can|ning and her friends fell into divers contradictions during the cour&s;e of the trial&punc; By this time the

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the common people in her favour had ri&s;en to &s;uch a pitch of enthu&s;ia&s;m, that the mo&s;t palpable truths, which appeared on the other &s;ide, had no other effect than that of exa&s;perating them to the mo&s;t dangerous degree of rage and revenge. Some of the witne&s;&s;es for Squires, tho' per&s;ons of unblemi&s;hed character, were &s;o intimi|dated that they dur&s;t not enter the court; and tho&s;e who had re&s;olution enough to give evidence in her behalf, ran the ri&s;que of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination from the vul|gar that &s;urrounded the place. On this occa&s;ion Sir Cri&s;pe Ga&s;coyne, lord-mayor of London, be|haved with that laudable courage and humanity which ought ever to di&s;tingui&s;h the chief magi|&s;trate of &s;uch a metropolis. Con&s;idering the im|probability of the charge, the heat, partiality, and blind enthu&s;ia&s;m with which it was pro&s;ecuted, and being convinced of the old woman's innocence by a great number of affidavits, voluntarily &s;ent up from the country by per&s;ons of unque&s;tionable cre|dit, he, in conjunction with &s;ome other worthy citizens, re&s;olved to oppo&s;e the torrent of vulgar prejudice. Application was made to the throne for mercy: the ca&s;e was referred to the attorney and &s;ollicitor-general, who, having examined the evidences on both &s;ides, made their report in fa|vour of Squires to the king and council; and this poor old creature was indulged with his maje&s;ty's pardon.</P>
<P>This affair was now &s;welled up into &s;uch a fac|tion as divided the greater part of the kingdom, including the rich as well as the poor, the high as well as the humble. Pamphlets and pa&s;quinades were publi&s;hed on both &s;ides of the di&s;pute, which

became the general topic of conver&s;ation in all a&s;|&s;emblies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753</NOTE> and people of all ranks e&s;pou&s;ed one or other party with as much warmth and animo&s;ity as had ever inflamed the Whig and Tories, even, at the mo&s;t rancorous period of their oppo&s;ition. Sub|&s;criptions were opened, and large &s;ums levied, on one &s;ide to pro&s;ecute for perjury the per&s;ons on who&s;e evidence the pardon had been granted. On the other hand, tho&s;e who had intere&s;ted them|&s;elves for the gip&s;ey re&s;olved to &s;upport her wit|ne&s;&s;es, and, if po&s;&s;ible, detect the impo&s;ture of Canning. Bills of perjury were preferred on both &s;ides. The evidences for Squires were tried and acquitted: at fir&s;t Canning ab&s;conded; but after|wards &s;urrendered, to take her trial; and being, after a long hearing, found guilty, was tran&s;ported to the Briti&s;h colonies. The zeal of her friends, however, &s;eemed to be inflamed by her conviction: and tho&s;e who carried on the pro&s;ecution again&s;t her were in&s;ulted, even to the danger of their lives. They &s;upplied her with nece&s;&s;aries of all &s;orts, payed for her tran&s;portation in a private &s;hip, where &s;he enjoyed all the comforts and conve|niencies that could be afforded in that &s;ituation, and furni&s;hed her with &s;uch recommendations as &s;ecured to her a very agreeable reception in New England.</P>

<PB REF="1610">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> where he was dangerou&s;ly wounded, found means to e&s;cape to the continent. His brother, the doc|tor, had accompanied him in all his expeditions, tho' not in a military capacity, and was included with him in the act of attainder pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t tho&s;e who had been concerned in the rebellion. Notwith&s;tanding the imminent danger attending &s;uch an attempt, he returned privately to Scot|land, in order (as it was reported) to recover a &s;um of money belonging to the pretender, which had been embezzled by his adherents in that country. Whatever may have been his inducement to revi&s;it his native country under &s;uch a predicament, cer|tain it is, he was di&s;covered, apprehended, conduct|ed to London, confined in the Tower, examined by the privy-council, and produced in the court of King's Bench; where his identity being proved by &s;everal witne&s;&s;es, he received &s;entence of death, and was executed at Tyburn. The terror and re&s;ent|ment of the people, occa&s;ioned by the rebellion, having by this time &s;ub&s;ided, their humane pa&s;&s;ions did not fail to operate in favour of this unfortunate gentlemen: their pity was mingled with e&s;teem, ari&s;ing from his per&s;onal character, which was alto|gether unblemi&s;hed, and his deportment on this oc|ca&s;ion, which they could not help admiring as the &s;tandard of manly fortitude and decorum. The populace, tho' not very &s;ubject to tender emotions, were moved to compa&s;&s;ion, and even to tears, by his behaviour at the place of execution. And many &s;incere well-wi&s;hers to the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment thought that the &s;acrifice of this victim at &s;uch a juncture could not redound either to its honour or &s;ecurity.</P>

The price of provi&s;ion, and bread in par|ticular, being rai&s;ed to an exorbitant rate, in con|&s;equence of an ab&s;urd exportation of corn, for the &s;ake of the bounty, a formidable body of colliers and other labouring people rai&s;ed an in&s;urrection at Bri&s;tol, began to plunder the corn ve&s;&s;els in the harbour, and commit &s;uch outrages in the city, that the magi&s;trates were obliged to have recour&s;e to the military power. A troop of dragoons were &s;ent to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and the in&s;urgents were quelled, though not without &s;ome blood&s;hed. Commotions of the &s;ame kind were excited in York&s;hire, Manche&s;ter, and &s;everal other places in the northern counties: at Leeds, a detachment of the king's troops were obliged in their own defence to fire upon the rioters, eight or nine of whom were killed upon the &s;pot; and indeed &s;o little care had been taken to re&s;train the licentious in&s;olence of the vulgar by proper laws and regulations, duly executed under the eye of civil magi&s;tracy, that a military power was found ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to maintain the peace of the kingdom.</P>

The parliament having cau&s;ed divers eccle&s;ia&s;tics to be apprehended for having refu&s;ed to admini&s;ter the &s;acraments to per&s;ons in extremity, who refu&s;ed to &s;ub&s;cribe to

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> the bull unigenitus, all of them declared they acted according to the direction of the archbi&s;hop of Paris. Application being made to this haughty prelate, he treated the deputies of the parliament with the mo&s;t &s;upercilious contempt, and even &s;eemed to brave the power and authority of that body. They, on the other hand, proceeded to take cognizance of the recu&s;ant clergy, until their &s;overeign ordered them to de&s;i&s;t. Then they pre|&s;ented remon&s;trances to his maje&s;ty, reminding him of their privileges and the duty of their &s;ta|tion, which obliged them to do ju&s;tice on all delin|quents.</P>
<P>In the mean time they continued to perform their functions, and even commenced a pro&s;ecution again&s;t the bi&s;hop of Orleans, whom they &s;um|moned to attend their tribunal. Next day they received from Ver&s;ailles a lettre de cachet, accom|panied by letters patent, commanding them to &s;u&s;|pend all pro&s;ecutions relating to the refu&s;al of the &s;acraments; and ordering the letters patent to be regi&s;tered. In&s;tead of obeying the&s;e commands, they pre&s;ented new remon&s;trances, for an&s;wers to which they were referred to the king's former declarations. In con&s;equence of this intimation, they had &s;pirit enough to re&s;olve, "That whereas certain evil minded per&s;ons had prevented truth from reaching the throne, the chambers remained a&s;&s;embled, and all other bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould be &s;u&s;|pended." The affair was now become very &s;erious. His maje&s;ty, by fre&s;h letters patent, renewed his orders, and commanded them to proceed with their ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s, on pain of incurring his di&s;plea|&s;ure. They forthwith came to another re&s;olution,
<PB N="161" REF="1640">
importing, that they could not obey this injunction<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> without a breach of their duty and their oath. Next day letters de cachet were i&s;&s;ued, bani&s;hing to different parts of the kingdom all the members except tho&s;e of the great chamber, which the court did not find more tractable than their brethren. They forthwith re&s;olved to abide by the two re&s;o|lutions mentioned above; and, as an in&s;tance of their un&s;haken fortitude, ordered an eccle&s;ia&s;tic to be taken into cu&s;tody for refu&s;ing the &s;acraments. This &s;pirited mea&s;ure involved them in the fate of the re&s;t; for they were al&s;o exiled from Paris, the citizens of which did not fail to extol their con|duct with the loude&s;t encomiums, and at the &s;ame time to expre&s;s their re&s;entment again&s;t the clergy, who could not &s;tir abroad without being expo&s;ed to violence or in&s;ult. The example of the parlia|ment of Paris was followed by that of Rouen, which had courage enough to i&s;&s;ue orders for ap|prehending the bi&s;hop of Evreux, becau&s;e he had refu&s;ed to appear when &s;ummoned to their tribu|nal. Their decrees on this occa&s;ion being an|nulled by the king's council of &s;tate, they pre&s;ented a bold remon&s;trance; which, however, had no other effect than that of exa&s;perating the mini&s;try. A grand deputation being ordered to attend the king, they were commanded to de&s;i&s;t from intermeddling in di&s;putes relating to the refu&s;al of the &s;acraments, and to regi&s;ter this injunction. At their return they had recour&s;e to a new remon&s;trance; and one of their principal coun&s;ellors, who had &s;poken freely in the debates on this &s;ubject, was arre&s;ted by a party of dragoons, who carried him pri&s;oner to the ca&s;tle of Dourlens. In a word, the body of

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> the people declared for the parliament, in oppo|&s;ition to eccle&s;ia&s;tical tyranny; and had they not been overawed by a formidable &s;tanding army, would certainly have taken up arms in defence of their liberties: while the monarch weakly &s;uffered him&s;elf to be governed by prie&s;tly delu&s;ions; and, &s;ecure in his military appointments, &s;eemed to &s;et the re&s;t of his &s;ubjects at defiance. Apprehen&s;ive, however, that the&s;e di&s;putes would put an entire &s;top to the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, he, by letters patent, e&s;tabli&s;hed a royal chamber for the pro&s;e|cution of &s;uits civil and criminal, which was opened with a &s;olemn ma&s;s performed in the queen's chapel at the Louvre, where all the mem|bers a&s;&s;i&s;ted. On this occa&s;ion another difficulty occurred. The letters patent con&s;tituting this new court ought to have been regi&s;tered by the par|liament, which was now no more. To remedy this defect, application was made to the inferior court of the Chatelet; which refu&s;ing to regi&s;ter them, one of its members was committed to the Ba&s;tile, and another ab&s;conded. Intimidated by this ex|ertion of de&s;potic power, they allowed the king's officers to enter the letters in their regi&s;ter; but afterwards adopted more vigorous re&s;olutions. The lieutenant civil appearing in their court, all the coun&s;ellors ro&s;e up and retired, leaving him alone, and on the table an arret, importing, That whereas the confinement of one of their members, the per&s;ecution of another, who dur&s;t not appear, and the pre&s;ent calamities of the nation, gave them ju&s;t apprehen&s;ion for their own per&s;ons, they had, after mature deliberation, thought proper to re|tire.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> To explain the &s;en&s;e of France, touching the bounds of Acadia in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred, the Briti&s;h commi&s;&s;aries produced a pro|po&s;al of the French amba&s;&s;ador, then re&s;iding in Great Britain, to re&s;train the limits of that country to the river St. George. They al&s;o in&s;tanced the &s;urrender of Port-Royal in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and ten, in which Acadia is de|&s;cribed with the &s;ame limits with which France had received it in the years one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and thirty-two, and one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and &s;ixty-&s;even. And further, to a&s;certain the &s;en&s;e of both crowns, even at the treaty of Utrecht it|&s;elf, they produced the queen of Great Britain's in&s;tructions to her amba&s;&s;adors, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and eleven, in which they were directed to in&s;i&s;t, "That his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian maje&s;ty &s;hould quit all claim or title, by virtue of any former treaty, or otherwi&s;e, to the country called Nova Scotia, and expre&s;ly to Port-Royal, otherwi&s;e Annapolis Royal." To the&s;e they added a manife&s;t demon&s;tration, founded on indi&s;putable facts, proving, that the recital of the &s;everal &s;orts of right which France have ever pretended to this country, and a &s;pecification of both terms, Aca|dia, or Nova Scotia, were intended by Great Bri|tain to obviate all doubts which had ever been made concerning the limits of Acadia, and to com|prehend, with more certainty, all that country which France had ever received as &s;uch: finally, to &s;pecify what France con&s;idered as Acadia, dur|ing the treaty, they referred to the offers of that crown in the year one thou&s;and &s;even &punc;hundred and twelve, in which &s;he propo&s;ed to re&s;train the

<P>From all the&s;e facts it plainly appears, that Great Britain demanded nothing but what the fair con|&s;truction of the words of the treaty of Utrecht ne|ce&s;&s;arily implies; and that it is impo&s;&s;ible for any thing to have more evident marks of candour and fairne&s;s in it, than the demand of the Engli&s;h on this occa&s;ion. From the variety of evidence brought in &s;upport of this claim, it evidently re|&s;ults, that the Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;aries a&s;&s;igned no limits as the ancient limits of Acadia, but tho&s;e which France her&s;elf determined to be &s;uch in the year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and thirty two; and which &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in con&s;equence of that deter|mination, till the year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and fifty-four: that in one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and &s;ixty-two France claimed, and received in one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and &s;ixty-nine, the country which Great Britain now claims as Acadia, re&s;tored to France by the treaty of Breda under that general denomination: that France never con&s;idered Aca|dia as having any other limits than tho&s;e which were a&s;&s;igned to it from the year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and thirty-two, to the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and ten; and that, by the treaty of Utrecht, &s;he engaged to transfer that very &s;ame country, as Acadia, which France has always a&s;|&s;erted and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and Great Britain now claims, as &s;uch.</P>
<P>Should the crown of France, therefore, be ever willing to decide what are the antient limits of Aca|dia,
<PB N="171" REF="1740">
by her own declarations &s;o frequently made in<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> like di&s;cu&s;&s;ions upon the &s;ame point, by her po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions of this country for almo&s;t a century, and by her de&s;cription of Acadia, during the negociation of that very treaty upon which this doubt is rai&s;ed, &s;he cannot but admit the claim of Great-Britain to be conformable to the treaty of Utrecht, and to the de&s;cription of the country transferred to Great Britain by the twelfth article of that treaty. There is a con&s;i&s;tency in the claim of the Engli&s;h, and a compleatne&s;s in the evidence brought in &s;upport of it, which is &s;eldom &s;een in di&s;cu&s;&s;ions of this &s;ort; for it rarely happens, in di&s;putes of &s;uch a nature between two crowns, that either of them can &s;afe|ly offer to have its preten&s;ions decided by the known and repeated declarations, or the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the other.</P>
<P>To an&s;wer the force of this detail of conclu&s;ive hi&s;torical facts, and give a new turn to the real que&s;tion in di&s;pute, the French commi&s;&s;aries, in their memorial laid it down, as a di&s;tinction made by the treaty of Utrecht, that the antient limits of Acadia, referred to by that treaty, are different from any with which that country may have pa&s;&s;ed under the treaties of St. Germain's and Breda; and then endeavoured to &s;hew, upon the te&s;timonies of maps and hi&s;torians, that Acadia and its limits were antiently confined to the &s;outh-ea&s;tern part of the penin&s;ula. In &s;upport of this &s;y&s;tem, the French commi&s;&s;aries had recour&s;e to antient maps and hi&s;torians, who, as they a&s;&s;erted, had ever con|fined Acadia to the limits they a&s;&s;igned. They al|ledged, that tho&s;e commi&s;&s;ions of the French go|vernment over Acadia, which the Engli&s;h cited as
<PB N="172" REF="1750">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> evidences of the limits they claimed, were given as comm&s;&s;ioners over Acadia and the country around it, and not over Acadia only: that the whole of the country claimed by the Engli&s;h, as Acadia, could not po&s;&s;ibly be &s;uppo&s;ed ever to have been con&s;idered as &s;uch, becau&s;e many parts of that ter|ritory always did, and &s;till do, pre&s;erve particular and di&s;tinct names. They affirmed New France to be a province in it&s;elf; and argued, that many parts of what we claim as Acadia, can never have been in Acadia, becau&s;e hi&s;torians and the French commi&s;&s;ions of government expre&s;ly place them in New France. They a&s;&s;erted, that no evidence can be drawn of the opinion of any crown, with re&s;pect to the limits of any country, from its declaration during the negotiation of a treaty; and, in the end, relying on maps and hi&s;torians for their an|tient limits of Acadia, they pretended that the ex|pre&s;s re&s;titution of St. Germain's, and the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion taken by France in con&s;equence of the treaty of Breda, after a long di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the limits, and the declaration of France during the negociation of the treaty of Utrecht, were foreign to the point in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>In refutation of the&s;e maxims, the Engli&s;h com|mi&s;&s;aries proved, from an examination of the maps and hi&s;torians cited by the French in &s;upport of their &s;y&s;tem, that if this que&s;tion was to be decided upon the authorities which they them&s;elves allowed to belong, and to be applicable, to this di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, the limits which they a&s;&s;igned were utterly incon|&s;i&s;tent with the be&s;t maps of all countries, which are authorities in point for almo&s;t every part of the claim of Great Britain. They &s;hewed, that the

French hi&s;torians Champlain and Denys, and par|ticularly<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> this la&s;t, with his commi&s;&s;ion in the year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and fifty-five, a&s;&s;igned the &s;ame northern and we&s;tern limits to Acadia which they did; and that E&s;carbot, another of their hi&s;torians, as far as any evidence can be drawn from his writings, agrees intirely with the former two. They ob&s;erved&punc; that all the&s;e evidences fall in with and confirm the better authorities of trea|ties, and the &s;everal tran&s;actions between the two crowns for near a century pa&s;t; and that the French commi&s;&s;aries, by deviating from treaties, and the late proceedings of the two crowns, to ancient hi&s;torians and maps, only made a tran&s;ition from an authentic to an in&s;ufficient &s;ort of evidence; and led the Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;aries into an inquiry, which proved, that both the proper and the im|proper, the regular and the foreign evidence, upon which this matter had been re&s;ted, equally con|futed the limits alledged by the French commi&s;&s;a|ries as the antient limits of Acadia.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambiti|ous &s;chemes of the French in North America.</NOTE> While the Briti&s;h mini&s;try depended upon the &s;ucce&s;s of the conferences between the commi&s;&s;a|ries of the two crowns at Paris, the French were actually employed in executing their plans of en|croachment upon the Briti&s;h colonies in North America. Their &s;cheme was to engro&s;s the whole-fur-trade of that continent; and they had already made great progre&s;s in extending a chain of forts, connecting their &s;ettlements on the river Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi with their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Canada, along the great lakes of Erie and Ontario, which la&s;t i&s;&s;ues in the river St. Laurence.

Their commercial &s;pirit did not keep pace with the gigantic &s;trides of their ambition: they could not &s;upply all tho&s;e Indians with the ne|ce&s;&s;aries they wanted, &s;o that many of the natives had recour&s;e to the Engli&s;h &s;ettlements; and this commerce produced a connection, in con&s;equence of which the Briti&s;h adventurers ventured to travel with merchandize as far as the banks of the river Ohio, that runs into the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, a great way the other fide of the Apalachean mountains, be|yond which none of our coloni&s;ts had attempted to penetrate.</P>
<P>The tract of country lying along the Ohio is &s;o fertile, plea&s;ant, and inviting, and the Indians, called Twightees, who inhabit tho&s;e delightful plains, were &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed towards a clo&s;e alli|ance with the Engli&s;h, that as far back as the year one thou&s;and &s;even handred and &s;ixteen, Mr. Spot&s;wood, governor of Virginia, propo&s;ed a plan for erecting a company to &s;ettle &s;uch lands upon this river as &s;hould be ceded to them by treaty with the natives; but the de&s;ign was at that time fru&s;trated, partly by the indolence and timidity of the Briti&s;h mini&s;try, who were afraid of giving umbrage to the French, and partly by the jealou|&s;ies and divi&s;ions &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the different colonies of Great Britain. The very &s;ame circum|&s;tances encouraged the French to proceed in their project of inva&s;ion. At length, they penetrated from the banks of the river St. Laurence, acro&s;s

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ri&s;e and conduct of the Ohio company.</NOTE> Governor Spot&s;wood's &s;cheme for an Ohio com|pany was revived immediately after the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, when certain merchants of Lon|don, who traded to Maryland and Virginia, peti|tioned the government of this &s;ubject, and were indulged not only with a grant of a great tract of ground to the &s;outhward of Pen&s;ylvania, which they promi&s;ed to &s;ettle; but al&s;o with an exclu&s;ive privilege of trading with the Indians on the banks of the river Ohio. This de&s;ign no &s;ooner tran&s;|pired, than the French governor of Canada took the alarm, and wrote letters to the governors of New York and Pen&s;ylvania, giving them to un|der&s;tand, that as the Engli&s;h inland traders had encroached on the French territories and privi|leges by trading with the Indians under the pro|tection of his &s;overeign, he would &s;eize them wherever they could be found, if they did not im|mediately de&s;i&s;t from that illicit practice. No re|gard being paid to this intimation, he next year cau&s;ed three Briti&s;h traders to be arre&s;ted. Their effects were confi&s;cated, and they them&s;elves con|veyed to Quebec, from whence they were &s;ent pri&s;oners to Rochelle in France, and there detained in confinement.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> the court of Ver&s;ailles promi&s;ed to tran&s;mit orders to the French governors in America to u&s;e all their endeavours for preventing any di&s;putes that might have a tendency to alter the good cor|re&s;pondence e&s;tabli&s;hed between the two nations; in all probability, the directions given were the very rever&s;e of the&s;e profe&s;&s;ions: for the French commanders, parti&s;ans, and agents in America, took every &s;tep their bu&s;y genius could &s;ugge&s;t, to &s;trengthen their own power, and weaken the in|fluence of the Engli&s;h, by embroiling them with the Indian nations. This ta&s;k they found the more ea&s;y, as the natives had taken offence again&s;t the Engli&s;h, when they under&s;tood that their lands were given away without their knowledge, and that there was a de&s;ign to build forts in their coun|try, without their con&s;ent and concurrence. In|deed the per&s;on whom the new company employed to &s;urvey the banks of the Ohio, concealed his de|&s;ign &s;o carefully, and behaved in other re&s;pects in &s;uch a dark my&s;terious manner, as could not fail to arou&s;e the jealou&s;y of a people naturally inqui&s;i|tive, and very much addicted to &s;u&s;picion. How the company propo&s;ed to &s;ettle this acqui&s;ition in de&s;pite of the native po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, it is not ea&s;y to conceive: and &s;till more unaccountable that they &s;hould have neglected the natives, who&s;e con&s;ent and a&s;&s;i&s;tance they might have procured at a very &s;mall expence.

To this &s;pirited in|timation the officer replied, That it was not his province to &s;pecify the evidence, and demon&s;trate the right of the king his ma&s;ter to the lands &s;ituated on the river Ohio; but he would tran&s;mit the let|ter to the marquis du Que&s;ne, and act according to the an&s;wer he &s;hould receive from that noble|man.

Mr. Dinwiddie ex|pected no other reply, and therefore had pro|jected a fort to be erected near the forks of the river. The province undertook to defray the ex|pence, and the &s;tores for that purpo&s;e were already provided; but, by &s;ome fatal over&s;ight, the con|currence of the Indians was neither obtained nor &s;olicited, and therefore they looked upon this mea|&s;ure with an evil eye, as a manife&s;t inva&s;ion of their property.</P>

As the&s;e &s;culking parties of Indians were generally directed and headed by French com|manders, repeated complaints were made to the governor of Loui&s;bourg, who &s;till an&s;wered that his juri&s;diction did not extend over the Indians, and that their French conductors were cho&s;en from the inhabitants of Annapolis, who thought proper to remain in that country after it was ceded to the Engli&s;h, and were in fact the &s;ubjects of Great Britain.

La Corne with &s;ome regular troops and a body of militia to for|tify a po&s;t on the bay of Chignecto, on pretence that this and a great part of the penin&s;ula belonged to his government. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this po&s;t not only &s;ecured to the Indians of the continent a free entrance into the peniu&s;ula, and a &s;afe retreat in ca&s;e of pur&s;uit; but al&s;o encouraged the French inhabitants of Annapolis to ri&s;e in open rebellion again&s;t the Engli&s;h government.</P>

Major Lawrence, being unable to cope with him in the field, demanded an interview, at which he de&s;ired to know for what cau&s;e the French inhabitants of Nova Scotia had &s;haken off their allegiance to the crown of Great Britain, and violated the neutrality which they had hitherto affected to profe&s;s. The French officer, without pretending to account for their behaviour, gave him to under&s;tand in general terms, that he had orders to defend his po&s;t, and the&s;e orders he was determined to obey.

He had by this time erected a fort, which he denominated Beau Sejour; and now the Engli&s;h built another on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river, which was called after its founder St. Laurence. This being provided with a good garri&s;on, &s;erved as a check upon the French, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure re&s;trained the incur&s;ions of their barbarians.

<P>The naturalization-bill, now devoted as a &s;acri|fice to the re&s;entment of the people, contained a clau&s;e di&s;abling all naturalized Jews from pur|cha&s;ing, inheriting, or receiving any advow&s;on or pre&s;entation, or right to any eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefice or promotion, &s;chool, ho&s;pital, or donative; and by the fir&s;t draught of the bill, which his grace now pre&s;ented, it was intended that this clau&s;e &s;hould not be repealed.

<P>In the lower hou&s;e the members of both parties &s;eemed to vie with each other in demon&s;trations of aver&s;ion to this unpopular act. On the very fir&s;t day of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, immediately after the motion for an addre&s;s to his maje&s;ty, Sir James Da&s;hwood, an eminent leader in the oppo&s;ition, gave the com|mons to under&s;tand, that he had a motion of very great importance to make, which would require the attention of every member, as &s;oon as the mo|tion for the addre&s;s &s;hould be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed: he there|fore de&s;ired they would not quit the hou&s;e, until he &s;hould have an opportunity to explain his pro|po&s;al. Accordingly they had no &s;ooner agreed to the motion for an addre&s;s of thanks to his maje&s;ty, than he &s;tood up again; and having expatiated upon the ju&s;t and general indignation which the act of the preceding &s;e&s;&s;ion, in favour of the Jews, had rai&s;ed among the people, he moved to order, that the hou&s;e &s;hould be called over on Tue&s;day the fourth day of December, for taking that act into con&s;ideration: but being given to under&s;tand, that it was not u&s;ual to appoint a call of the hou&s;e for any particular purpo&s;e, he agreed that the mo|tion

&s;hould be general. It was &s;econded by lord<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> Parker, his oppo&s;ite in political intere&s;ts: the hou&s;e agreed to it without oppo&s;ition, and the call was ordered accordingly. They were anticipated how|ever by the lords, who framed and tran&s;mitted to them a bill on the &s;ame &s;ubject. To the purport of it the commons made no objection; for every member, having the fear of the general election before his eyes, carefully avoided every expre&s;&s;ion which could give umbrage to his con&s;tituents: but violent oppo&s;ition was made to the preamble, which ran in the following &s;train: "Whereas an act of parliament was made and pa&s;&s;ed in the twenty-fifth year of his maje&s;ty's reign, intituled, An act to permit per&s;ons profe&s;&s;ing the Jewi&s;h religion to be naturalized by parliament, and for other pur|po&s;es therein mentioned; and whereas occa&s;ion has been taken, from the &s;aid act, to rai&s;e di&s;contents and di&s;quiets in the minds of his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, be it enacted, &amp;c." This introduction was con&s;i|dered as an unju&s;t reflection upon the body of the people in general, and in particular upon tho&s;e who had oppo&s;ed the bill in the cour&s;e of the pre|ceding &s;e&s;&s;ion. Sir Roger Newdigate therefore moved, that the expre&s;&s;ion &s;hould be varied to this effect: "Whereas great di&s;contents and di&s;quie|tudes had from the &s;ad act ari&s;en." The con&s;e|quence of this motion was an ob&s;tinate debate, in which it was &s;upported by the earl of Eg&mdash;t, and divers other able orators; but Mr. Pelham and Mr. P&mdash;were numbered among its oponents. The que&s;tion being put for the propo&s;ed alteration, it was of cour&s;e carried in the negative: the bill, after the third reading, pa&s;&s;ed nemine contradi|cente,

It was moved therefore in the lower hou&s;e, that part of this former act might be read: then the &s;ame member made a motion for an addre&s;s to his ma|je&s;ty, de&s;iring, that the hou&s;e might have the pe|ru&s;al of the li&s;ts tran&s;mitted from the American co|lonies to the commi&s;&s;ioners for trade and planta|tions, containing the names of all &s;uch per&s;ons pro|fe&s;&s;ing the Jewi&s;h religion as had intitled them|&s;elves to the benefit of the &s;aid act &s;ince the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and forty.</P>
<P>The&s;e li&s;ts were accordingly pre&s;ented, and left upon the table for the peru&s;al of the members: but as this act contained no limitation of time within which the benefit of it &s;hould be claimed, and as this claim was attended with a good deal of trouble and &s;ome expence, very few per&s;ons had availed them&s;elves of it in that period.

Divers other alterations were made, of le&s;s importance to the public. Sir George Lyttleton was appointed cofferer, and the earl of Hill&s;borough comptroller of the hou&s;hold. Mr. George Greenville, bro|ther to earl Temple, became trea&s;urer of the navy; and Mr. Charles Town&s;hend, of whom we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak in the &s;equel, took place as a commi&s;&s;ioner at the board of admiralty, in the room of lord Barrington, made ma&s;ter of the wardrobe. Lord Hardwicke, the chancellor, was promoted to the dignity of earl.

commons in Ireland, on the almo&s;t forgotten &s;ub|jects<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> of privilege and prerogative. The commons<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;putes in the par|liament of Ireland, concern|ing prero|gative and privile ge.</NOTE> conceived they had an undoubted right to apply the &s;urplus of their revenue towards national pur|po&s;es, without the con&s;ent of their &s;overeign; and accordingly, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hun|dred and forty-nine, prepared a bill with this pre|amble: "Whereas on the twenty fifth day of March la&s;t a con&s;iderable ballance remained in the hands of the vice-trea&s;urers or receivers-general of the kingdom, or their deputy or deputies, unap|plied; and it will be for your maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, and for the ea&s;e of your faithful &s;ubjects in this kingdom, that &s;o much thereof as can be conve|niently &s;pared &s;hould be payed, agreeable to your maje&s;ty's mo&s;t gracious intentions, in di&s;charge of part of the national debt."</P>
<P>This appropriation gave great offence to the ad|vocates for prerogative in England, who affirmed, that the commons had no right to apply any part of the unappropriated revenue, nor even to take any &s;uch affair into con&s;ideration, without the pre|vious con&s;ent of the crown, expre&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t explicit terms. It was in con&s;equence of this doc|trine, that the duke of Dor&s;et, lord lieutenant of Ireland, told them in the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, held in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-one, he was commanded by the king to ac|quaint them, that his maje&s;ty, ever attentive to the ea&s;e and happine&s;s of his &s;ubjects, would gra|ciou&s;ly con&s;ent, and recommended it to them, that &s;uch a part of the money then remaining in his trea&s;ury, as &s;hould be thought con&s;i&s;tent with

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> the public &s;ervice, $e applied towards the further reduction of the national debt.</P>
<P>This declaration alarmed the commons, zealous as they were for the pre&s;ervation of their privileges, and in their addre&s;s of thanks, which, like that of the parliament of Great-Britain, u&s;ed always to eccho back the words of the &s;peech, they made no mention of his maje&s;ty's con&s;ent; but only ac|knowledged his gracious attention to their ea&s;e and happine&s;s, in recommending to them the application of the &s;urplus. They accordingly re&s;olved to apply one hundred and twenty thou&s;and pounds of that overplus towards a di&s;charge of the national debt; and in the preamble of the bill, framed for this purpo&s;e, made no mention of his maje&s;ty's con&s;ent, though before they had acknowledged his good|ne&s;s in recommending this application.</P>
<P>The mini&s;try in England were highly offended at this purpo&s;ed omi&s;&s;ion, which they con&s;trued into a wilful encroachment on the prerogative; and the bill was &s;ent back with an alteration in the pre|amble, &s;ignifying his maje&s;ty's con&s;ent as well as recommendation.</P>
<P>The Iri&s;h hou&s;e of commons being at that time deeply engaged in a minute inquiry into the con|duct of a gentleman, a &s;$$$ant to the crown, and a member of their own hou&s;e, accu&s;ed of having mi&s;applied a large &s;um of money with which he had been intru&s;ted, for rebuilding or $word$ the barracks, were n$w u$w$l$ing to $word$ them|&s;elves fur$her with the government, until his affair &s;hould be $word$ They therefore pa&s;&s;ed the bill with the alteration, and proceeded with their in|quiry.
<PB N="197" REF="2040">
The per&s;on was convicted of having mi&s;|applied<NOTE PLACE="marg">An: 1754.</NOTE> the public money, and ordered to make the barracks fit for the reception and accommoda|tion of the troops, at his own expence. They did not, however, neglect to a&s;&s;ert what they thought their rights and privileges, when the next oppor|tunity occurred.</P>
<P>The duke of Dor&s;et, when he opened the &s;e&s;&s;ion of this year, repeated the expre&s;&s;ion of his maje&s;ty's gracious con&s;ent, in mentioning the &s;urplus of the public money. They again omitted that word in their addre&s;s; and re&s;olved, in their bill of appli|cation, not only to &s;ink this odious term, but like|wi&s;e to abate in their com$la$$ance to the crown, by leaving out that expre&s;&s;ion of grateful acknow|ledgment, which had met with &s;uch a cold recep|tion above.</P>
<P>By this time the conte&s;t had kindled up two violent factions, and diffu&s;ed a general &s;pirit of re&s;entment through the whole Iri&s;h nation. The committee who prepared the bill, in&s;tead of in&s;ert|ing the u&s;ual compliments in the preamble, men|tioned nothing but a recital of facts, and &s;ent it over in a very plain dre&s;s, quite de&s;titute of all em|broidery. The mini&s;try, intent upon vindicating the prerogative from &s;uch an unmannerly attack, filled up the omi&s;&s;ions of the committee, and &s;ent it back with this alteration: "And your maje&s;ty, ever attentive to the ea&s;e and happine&s;s of your faithful &s;ubjects, has been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to &s;ig|nify that you would con&s;ent, and to recommend it to us, that &s;o much of the money remaining in your maje&s;ty's trea&s;ury as &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary, be applied to the di&s;charge of the national debt, or

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> &s;uch part thereof as &s;hould be thought expedient by parliament." This then being the cri&s;is, which was to determine a con&s;titutional point of &s;uch im|portance, namely, whether the people in parlia|ment a&s;&s;embled have a right to deliberate upon, and vote the application of any part of the unap|propriated revenue, without the previous con&s;ent of the crown; tho&s;e who were the mo&s;t zealou&s;ly attached to the liberties of their country, re&s;olved to exert th m&s;elves in oppo&s;ing what they con|ceived to be a violation of the&s;e liberties; and the bill, with its alterations, was rejected by a majority of five voices. The &s;ucce&s;s of their endeavours was celebrated with the mo&s;t extravagant $word$ as a triumph of patrioti&s;m over the arts of $word$ corruption; and, on the other hand, all the &s;ervants of the crown, who had joined the po$ular cry on this occa&s;ion, were in a little time $word$ from their employments.</P>
<P>The rejection of the bill was a great di&s;appoint|ment the creditors of the public, and the circu|lation of ca&s;h was almo&s;t &s;tagnated. The&s;e cala|mi$$es were imputed to arbitrary de&s;igns in the government; and the people began to be inflamed with an enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;pirit of independency, which might have produced mi&s;chievous effects, had not a$$ful &s;t$$s been taken to bring over the dema|gog$es, and thus divert the &s;tream of popular cla|mour f om the mini&s;try to tho&s;e very individuals who had been the idols of popular veneration.

<P>That the reader may have a clear and di&s;tinct idea of the&s;e tran&s;actions, we &s;hall exhibit a &s;hort &s;ketch of the Engli&s;h forts and &s;ettlements in that remote country. The fir&s;t of the&s;e we &s;hall men|tion is Surat, in the province &s;o called, &s;ituated between the twenty-fir&s;t and twenty &s;econd de|grees of north-latitude: from hence the penin&s;ula &s;tretches into the Indian ocean, as far as the lati|tude of eight north, ending in a point at Cape Comorin, which is the &s;outhern extremity.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Account of the Engli&s;h &s;ettle|ments along the coa&s;ts of Malabar and Co|roman|del.</NOTE> The next Engli&s;h &s;ettlement to Surat, on the coa&s;t of the penin&s;ula, is Bombay, in the kingdom of Decan, a &s;mall i&s;land, with a very convenient harbour, about five and forty leagues to the &s;outh of Surat. The town is very populous: but the &s;oil is barren and the climate unhealthy; and the commerce was rendered very precarious by the neighbourhood of the famous cor&s;air Angria, un|til his port of Geriah was taken, and his fortifica|tions demoli&s;hed. The Engli&s;h company likewi&s;e carry on &s;ome traffic at Dabul, about forty leagues farther to the &s;outh, in the province of Cuncan. In the &s;ame &s;outherly progre&s;&s;ion, towards the point of the penin&s;ula, we arrive at Carwar, in the lati|tude of fifteen degrees, where there is a &s;mall fort and factory belonging to the company, &s;tanding on the &s;outh &s;ide of a bay, with a river capable of
<PB N="201" REF="2090">
receiving &s;hips of pretty large burthen. The cli|mate<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> here is remarkably &s;alubrious; the country abounds with provi&s;ions of all &s;orts, and the be&s;t pepper of India grows in this neighbourhood.</P>
<P>The next Engli&s;h &s;ettlement we find at Til|lechery, where the company has erected a fort, to defend their commerce of pepper and cardamoms from the in&s;ults of the rajah, who governs this part of Malabar. Hither the Engli&s;h trade was removed from Calicut, a large town, that &s;tands fifteen leagues to the &s;outhward of Tillechery, and was as well frequented as any port on the coa&s;t of the Indian penin&s;ula.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t &s;outherly &s;ettlement which the Eng|li&s;h po&s;&s;e&s;s on the Malabar coa&s;t is that of Anjengo, between the eighth and ninth degrees of latitude. It is defended by a regular fort, &s;ituated on a broad river which falls into the &s;ea, and would be very commodious for trade, were not the water on the bar too &s;hallow to admit &s;hips of con&s;iderable bur|then.</P>
<P>Then turning the cape, and pa&s;&s;ing through the &s;trait of Chilao, formed by the i&s;land of Ceylon, we arrive on the coa&s;t of Coromandel, which forms the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the i&s;thmus. Pro&s;ecuting our cour&s;e in a northern direction, the fir&s;t Engli&s;h factory we reach is that of Fort St. David's, formerly called Tegapatan, &s;ituated in the latitude of eleven de|grees forty minutes north, within the kingdoms of Gingi. It was, about &s;ix and twenty years ago, &s;old by a Marahatta prince to the Ea&s;t India com|pany, and, next to Bombay, is the mo&s;t con&s;ider|able &s;ettlement we have yet mentioned. Its terri|tory extends about eight miles along the coa&s;t, and
<PB N="202" REF="2100">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> half that &s;pace up the country, which is delight|fully watered by a variety of rivers: the &s;oil is fer|tile, and the climate healthy. The fort is regular, well provided with cannon, ammunition, and a numerous garri&s;on, which is the more nece&s;&s;ary on account of the neighbourhood of the French &s;et|tlement at Pondicherry. The trade con&s;i&s;ts in long cloths of different colours, &s;allampores, morees, dimitties, ginghams, and &s;uccatoons.</P>
<P>But the chief &s;ettlement belonging to the com|pany on this coa&s;t is that of Madra&s;s, or Fort St. George, &s;tanding farther to the northward, be|tween the thirteenth and fourteenth degrees of lati|tude, and not a great way from the diamond mines of Golconda. It is &s;eated on a flat, barren, &s;corch|ing &s;and, &s;o near the &s;ea, that, in bad weather, the walls are endangered by the mighty &s;urges rolled in from the ocean. As the &s;oil is barren, the cli|mate is &s;o inten&s;ely hot, that it would be altogether uninhabitable, were not the heat mitigated by the &s;ea-breezes. On the land &s;ide it is defended by a &s;alt-water river, which, while it contributes to the &s;ecurity of the place, robs the inhabitants of one great comfort, by ob&s;tructing the &s;prings of fre&s;h water. The fort is a regular &s;quare, the town &s;ur|rounded with walls well mounted with artillery, and the place, including the Black Town, is very populous. Madra&s;s, with &s;everal villages in the neighbourhood, was purcha&s;ed of the king of Gol|conda, before the Mogul became &s;overeign of this country. The governor of this place is not only pre&s;ident of Fort St. George, but al&s;o of all the other &s;ettlements on the coa&s;ts of Malabar and Co|romandel as far as the i&s;land of Sumatra. He lives

in great pomp, having inferior judges who pa&s;s<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> &s;entence of death occa&s;ionally on malefactors of any nation, except the &s;ubjects of Great Britain. All the company's affairs are directed by him and his council, who are inve&s;ted with the power of inflicting corporal puni&s;hment, &s;hort of life and member, upon &s;uch Europeans as are in the &s;er|vice, and di&s;po&s;e of all places of tru&s;t and profit. By virtue of an act pa&s;&s;ed in the cour&s;e of this very &s;e&s;&s;ion, the military officers belonging to the com|pany were permitted to hold courts-martial, and puni&s;h their &s;oldiers according to the degree of their delinquency. In a word, Madra&s;s is of the utmo&s;t importance to the company for its &s;trength, wealth, and the great returns it makes in calicoes and mu&s;lins.</P>
<P>Towards the latter end of the la&s;t century the Engli&s;h company had a flouri&s;hing factory at Ma&s;|&s;ulipatam, &s;tanding on the north &s;ide of the river Nagundi, which &s;eparates the provinces of Gol|conda and Bi&s;nagar, in the latitude of &s;ixteen de|grees and thirty minutes; but now there is no Eu|ropean &s;ettlement here, except a Dutch factory, maintained for carrying on the chintz commerce.</P>
<P>At Vi&s;igapatam, &s;ituated &s;till farther to the northward, the Engli&s;h po&s;&s;e&s;s a factory, regularly fortified, on the &s;ide of a river, which, however, a dangerous bar has rendered unfit for navigation. The adjacent country affords cotton cloths, and the be&s;t &s;triped mu&s;lins of India. It is chiefly for the u&s;e of this &s;ettlement, that the company maintains a factory at Ganjam, the mo&s;t ea&s;tern town in the province or kingdom of Golcon|da, &s;ituated in a country abounding with rice
<PB N="204" REF="2120">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> and &s;ugar canes. Still farther to the north coa&s;t, in the latitude of twenty-two degrees, the company maintains a factory at Bala&s;ore, which was formerly very con&s;iderable; but hath been of little con&s;e|quence &s;ince the navigation of the river Huguely was improved. At this place every European &s;hip bound for Bengal and the Ganges takes in a pilot. The climate is not counted very &s;alubrious; but the adjacent country is fruitful to admiration, and here are con&s;iderable manufactures of cotton and &s;ilk. Without &s;kilful pilots, the Engli&s;h would find it very difficult to navigate the different chan|nels through which the river Ganges di&s;charges it|&s;elf into the &s;ea at the bottom of the bay of Ben|gal. On the &s;outhern branch is a town called Pi|pely, where there was formerly an Engli&s;h fac|tory: but this was removed to Huguely, one hun|dred and &s;ixty miles farther up the river; a place which, together with the company's &s;ettlement at Calcutta, were the emporiums of their commerce for the whole kingdom of Bengal. Indeed Huguely is now abandoned by the Engli&s;h, and their whole trade centers at Calcutta or Fort William, which is a regular fortification, containing lodgings for the factors and writers, &s;tore-hou&s;es for the com|pany's merchandize, and magazines for their am|munition. As for the governor's hou&s;e, which likewi&s;e &s;tands within the fort, it is one of the mo&s;t regular &s;tructures in all India. Be&s;ides the&s;e &s;ettlements along the &s;ea-coa&s;t of the penin&s;ula, and on the banks of the Ganges, the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-In|dia company po&s;&s;e&s;s certain inland factories and po&s;ts for the convenience and defence of their com|merce, either purcha&s;ed of the nabobs and rajahs,

or conquered in the cour&s;e of the war. As the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> operations we propo&s;e to record, were confined to the coa&s;ts of Malabar and Coromandel, or the in|terior countries which form the penin&s;ula intra Gangem, it will be unnece&s;&s;ary to de&s;cribe the fac|tory at Bencoolen on the i&s;land of Sumatra, or any &s;ettlement which the Engli&s;h po&s;&s;e&s;s in other parts of the Ea&s;t Indies.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;pute about the govern|ment of Arcot.</NOTE> In order to under&s;tand the military tran&s;actions of the Engli&s;h company in India, the reader will take notice, that immediately after the peace of Aix la Chapelle, Mon&s;ieur du Pleix, who com|manded for the French in that country, began by his intrigues to &s;ow the &s;eeds of di&s;&s;en&s;ion among the nabobs, that he might be the better able to fi&s;h in troubled waters. Sundah Saheb, nabob of Arcot, having been depo&s;ed by the great Mogul, who placed Anawerde Khan in his room, he re|&s;olved to recover his government by force, and had recour&s;e to the French general at Pondicherry, who reinforced him with two thou&s;and &s;ipoys, or &s;ol|diers of the country, &s;ixty kafres, and four hun|dred and twenty French troops, on condition that if he proved &s;ucce&s;sful in his enterprize, he &s;hould cede to the French the town of Velur in the neigh|bourhood of Pondicherry, with its dependencies, con&s;i&s;ting of forty-five villages. Thus reinforced, he defeated his rival Anawerde Khan, who lo&s;t his life in the engagement, rea&s;&s;umed the government of Arcot, and punctually performed the condi|tions which had been &s;tipulated by his French allies.</P>

In con&s;equence of the&s;e repre&s;entations, he received another &s;trong rein|forcement under the command of captain Cope; but nothing of importance was attempted, and the Engli&s;h auxiliaries retired. Then Mahommed was attacked by the enemy, who obtained over him a complete victory. Finding it impo&s;&s;ible to main|tain his footing by his own &s;trength, he entered into a clo&s;e alliance with the Engli&s;h, and ceded to them &s;ome commercial points, which had been long in di&s;pute. Then they detached captain Cope to put Tiruchirapalli in a po&s;ture of defence; while captain Gingen, a Swi&s;s officer, marched at the head of four hundred Europeans to the nabob's a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The two armies being pretty equal in &s;trength, lay encamped in &s;ight of each other a whole month; during which nothing happened but a few &s;kirmi&s;hes, which generally terminated to the advantage of the Engli&s;h auxiliaries.</P>
<P>In order to make a diver&s;ion, and divide the French forces, the company re&s;olved to &s;end a de|tachment into the province of Arcot; and this was

the fir&s;t occa&s;ion upon which the extraordinary ta|lents<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> of Mr. Clive were di&s;played. He had entered into the &s;ervice of the Ea&s;t India company as a writer, and was con&s;idered as a per&s;on very indif|ferently qualified for &s;ucceeding in any civil &s;ta|tion of life. He now offered his &s;ervice in a mili|tary capacity, and actually began his march to Ar|cot, at the head of two hundred and ten Europeans.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. Clive takes po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of Arcot, in which he is be|&s;ieged.</NOTE> Such was the re&s;olution, &s;ecrecy, and di&s;patch with which he conducted this enterprize, that the enemy knew nothing of his motions until he was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the capital, which he took without oppo&s;ition. The inhabitants, expecting to be plundered, offered him a large &s;um to &s;pare their city; but they derived their &s;ecurity from the ge|nero&s;ity and di&s;cretion of the conqueror. He re|fu&s;ed the profered ran&s;om, and i&s;&s;ued a proclama|tion, intimating, That tho&s;e who were willing to remain in their hou&s;es &s;hould be protected from in&s;ult and injury, and the re&s;t have leave to retire with all their effects, except provi&s;ions, for which he promi&s;ed to pay the full value. By this &s;age conduct he conciliated the affections of the people &s;o intirely, that even tho&s;e who quitted the place &s;upplied him with exact intelligence of the enemy's de&s;igns, when he was be&s;ieged in the &s;equel. The town was in a little time inve&s;ted by the French nabob, Sundah Saheb, at the head of a numerous army, and the operations of the &s;iege were con|ducted by European engineers.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He de|feats the enemy in the plains of Arani, and ob|tains a &s;e|cond com|plete vic|tory over them at Koveri|pauk.</NOTE> This gailant Engli&s;hman, not contented with the reputation he had acquired from his noble de|fence, was no &s;ooner reinforced by a detachment under captain Kirkpatrick, than he marched in pur&s;uit of the enemy, whom he overtook in the plains of Arani. There, on the third day of De|cember, he attacked them with irre&s;i&s;tible impe|tuo&s;ity; and, after an ob&s;tinate di&s;pute, obtained a complete victory at a very &s;mall expence. The cities of Arani and Kajevaran &s;urrendered to the terror of his name, rather than to the force of his arms; and he returned to Fort St. David's in tri|umph. He had enjoyed a very few weeks of re|po&s;e, when he was &s;ummoned to the field by fre&s;h incur&s;ions of the enemy.

Though they were ad|vantageou&s;ly po&s;ted and intrenched, and the day

It was now dark, and the battle doubtful, when Mr. Clive &s;ent round a detachment to fall on the rear of the French battery. This attack was executed with great re&s;olution, while the Engli&s;h in front entered the intrenchments with their bayonets fix|ed; and, though very little tinctured with di&s;ci|pline, di&s;played the &s;pirit and activity of hardy veterans. This double attack di&s;concerted the enemy in &s;uch a manner, that they &s;oon de&s;i&s;ted from all oppo&s;ition. A con&s;iderable carnage en|&s;ued; yet the greater part of the enemy, both hor&s;e and foot, &s;aved them&s;elves by flight, under cover of the darkne&s;s. The French, to a man, threw down their arms, and &s;urrendered them&s;elves pri|&s;oners of war; and all the cannon and baggage fell into the hands of the victor.</P>
<P>The province of Arcot being thus cleared of the enemy, Mr. Clive with his forces returned to Fort St. David's, where he found major Laurence ju&s;t arrived from England, to take upon him the com|mand of the troops in the company's &s;ervice.

From hence he detached Mr. Clive with four hundred Euro|pean &s;oldiers, a few Marahatta hor&s;e, and a body of &s;ipoys, to cut off the enemy's retreat to Pondi|cherry. In the cour&s;e of this expedition he di&s;|lodged a &s;trong body of the foe po&s;ted at Samea|varem, and obliged Sundah Saheb to throw a body of troops into a &s;trong fortified temple upon

He found that officer in|trenched in a village, from whence he drove him with precipitation, and made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the French cannon. The enemy attempted to &s;ave them&s;elves in a neighbouring fort; but the gates being &s;hut again&s;t them by the governor, who was apprehen&s;ive that they would be followed pell-mell by the Engli&s;h, Mr. Clive attacked them with great fury, and made a con&s;iderable &s;laughter: but his humanity being &s;hocked at this carnage, he &s;ent a flag of truce to the vanqui&s;hed with terms of capi|tulation, which they readily embraced.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A general view of the Briti&s;h colonies in North America.</NOTE> As this war may be termed a native of America, and the principal &s;cenes of it have been acted on that continent, we &s;hall, for the information of the reader, &s;ketch out the &s;ituation of the Briti&s;h colo|nies as they border on each other, and extend along the &s;ea-coa&s;t from the gulph of St. Laurence as far &s;outh as the country of Florida. We &s;hall enume|rate the Indian nations that lie &s;cattered about their confines, and delineate the manner in which the French have hemmed them in by a &s;urpri&s;ing line of fortifications. Should we comprehend Hud|&s;on's bay, with the adjacent countries, and the banks of Newfoundland, in this geographical de|tail, we might affirm that Great Britain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a territory, along the &s;ea-coa&s;t, extending &s;eventeen hundred miles in a direct line, from the &s;ixtieth to the thirty-fir&s;t degree of northern latitude: but as the&s;e two countries have not yet been concerned in the pre&s;ent di&s;pute, we &s;hall advance from the northward to the &s;outhern &s;ide of the gulph of St. Laurence; and beginning with Acadie, or Nova Scotia, de&s;cribe our &s;ettlements as they lie in a &s;outherly direction as far as the gulph of Florida.</P>

The French who had no legal claim to any lands on the &s;outh &s;ide of this river, have neverthele&s;s, with an in&s;olence of ambition peculiar to them&s;elves, not only extended their forts from the &s;ource of the St. Laurence, through an im|men&s;e tract of country as far as the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, which di&s;embogues it&s;elf into the gulph of Florida; but al&s;o, by a &s;eries of unparalleled encroachments, have endeavoured to contract the Engli&s;h colonies within &s;uch narrow limits as will cut off almo&s;t one half of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.</P>

<P>New Hamp&s;hire, the mo&s;t northern of the four, is the lea&s;t populous; perhaps becau&s;e it is a royal government, the crown having the nomination of all the officers of ju&s;tice, the militia, and the mem|bers of the council.</P>

The coloni&s;ts, who cultivate the country, are hardy, indu&s;trious, and generally &s;ub&s;tantial; and the inferior people among them manufacture both linen and woollen cloth for their own wearing. The commodities in which they trade are wheat, flour, barley, oats, Indian corn, peas, beef, pork, chee&s;e, butter, cyder, beer, flax, hemp, lin&s;eed oil, furs and deer-&s;kins, &s;taves, lum|ber, and iron.

This noble bay is about eighteen miles broad for a con&s;iderable &s;pace, and &s;even at its narrowe&s;t part, yielding generally nine fathoms depth of water; on both &s;ides it receives many navigable rivers, tho&s;e on the Virginia &s;ide being known by the names of James river, York river, the Rappahannock and Potowmack. This country, e&s;pecially towards the &s;ea, lies very low and &s;wampy, and the &s;oil is ex|tremely fertile. The air and weather are variable; the heats of &s;ummer exce&s;&s;ive; the fro&s;ts of winter &s;udden and inten&s;ely cold; &s;o that, upon the whole, the climate is neither very agreeable nor healthy, the people being particularly &s;ubject to agues and pleuritic di&s;orders.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> The country of Carolina is divided into two go|vernments, of which the mo&s;t northern is the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable. The climate in both is the &s;ame, as well as the &s;oil: the fir&s;t is warm, though not unhealthy; the la&s;t extremely fertile, yielding every thing in plenty which is produced in Virgi|nia, be&s;ides abundance of excellent oranges, and &s;ome commodities which are not found to the north|ward. North Carolina, though not &s;o opulent, is more populous than the &s;outhern part. The chief town, called Edenton, is no better than a trifling village; but the pre&s;ent governor has projected another capital farther &s;outh, upon the river Neus. The coloni&s;ts of North Carolina carry on a con|&s;iderable traffick in tar, pitch, turpentine, &s;taves, &s;hingles, lumber, corn, peas, pork and beef, to|bacco, deer-&s;kins, indigo, wheat, rice, bees-w ax, tallow, bacon, and hog's lard, cotton, and &s;quared timber, live cattle, with the &s;kins of beaver, ra|coon, fox, minx, wild cat, and otter. South Ca|rolina is much better cultivated; the people are more civilized, and the commerce more important. The capital of this province, called Charles-town, is finely &s;ituated at the confluence of two navigable rivers, having the advantage of a commodious harbour. The town, which, for &s;ize, beauty, and commerce, may be deemed one of the fir&s;t in North America, contains about eight hundred hou&s;es well built; and is regularly fortified.

<P>The government of England having received nothing but eva&s;ive an&s;wers from the court of France, rouching the complaints that were made of the encroachments in America, di&s;patched orders to all the governors of that country to repel force by force, and drive the French from their &s;ettle|ments on the river Ohio. Accordingly the pro|vinces of Virginia and Pen&s;ylvania took this im|portant affair into their con&s;ideration; but, while they deliberated, the French vigorou&s;ly pro&s;ecuted their de&s;igns on the other &s;ide of the mountains.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The French &s;urpri&s;e Logs-town on the river Ohio.</NOTE> They &s;urpri&s;ed Logs-town, which the Virginians had built upon the Ohio; made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the Block-hou&s;e and Truck&punc;hou&s;e, where they found &s;kins and other commodities to the amount of twenty thou&s;and pounds, and de&s;troyed all the Briti&s;h traders, except two who found means to e&s;cape. At the &s;ame time M. de Contrecoeur, with a thou&s;and men and eighteen pieces of can|non, arrived in three hundred canoes from Venan|go, a fort they had rai&s;ed on the banks of the Ohio, and reduced by &s;urprize a Briti&s;h fort which the Virginians had built on the forks of the Mo|nangahela, that runs into the &s;ame river.</P>
<P>The&s;e ho&s;tilities were followed by divers &s;kir|mi&s;hes between the people of the two nations, which were fought with various &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>At length the governors of the Engli&s;h &s;ettle|ments received orders from England to form a political con&s;ederacy, for their mutual defence: and the governor of New York was directed to confer with the chiefs of the Six Nations, with a

The truth is, the French had artfully weaned them from their attachment to the &s;ubjects of Great Bri|tain. Neverthele&s;s, they accepted the pre&s;ents, renewed their treaties with the king of England, and even demanded his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in driving the French from the po&s;ts and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions they had u&s;urped within the Indian territories.</P>
<P>It was in con&s;equence of the mea&s;ures here taken, that colonel Wa&s;hington was detached from Virginia with four hundred men, and occupied a po&s;t on the banks of the river Ohio, where he threw up &s;ome works, and erected a kind of an oc|ca&s;ional fort, in hope of being able to defend him|&s;elf in that &s;ituation, until he &s;hould be joined by a reinforcement from New York, which however did not arrive. While he remained in this &s;itua|tion, De Viller, a French commander, at the head of nine hundred men, being on his march to di&s;|lodge Wa&s;hington, detached one Jamonville, an inferior officer, with a &s;mall party, and a formal &s;ummons to Wa&s;hington, requiring him to quit the fort, which he pretended was built on ground belonging to the French, or their allies. So little regard was payed to this intimation, that the Eng|li&s;h fell upon this party, and, as the French af|firm,

<P>This event was no &s;ooner known in England, than the Briti&s;h amba&s;&s;ador at Paris received direc|tions to complain of it to the French mini&s;try as an open violation of the peace; but this repre&s;en|tation had no effect.</P>
<P>Both nations by this time fore&s;aw that a rupture would be inevitable, and each re&s;olved to make &s;uitable preparations.

In his endeavours to check this traffic, which he deemed &s;o detrimental to his &s;ubjects, he inflicted hard&s;hips on the Briti&s;h merchants &s;ettled at Lisbon: &s;ome were impri&s;on|ed on frivolous pretences; others deprived of their property, and obliged to quit the kingdom. He in&s;i&s;ted upon laying an impo&s;ition of two per cen|tum on all the Portugue&s;e gold that &s;hould be ex|ported; but the profits of the trade would not bear &s;uch an exaction. Mean while, there being a

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bri|ti&s;h par|liament opened.</NOTE> On the fourteenth day of November the king of Great Britain opened the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament with an harangue, which intimated nothing of an approaching rupture.

He declared his principal view &s;hould be to &s;trengthen the foundation, and &s;ecure the duration of a general peace; to improve the pre&s;ent advantages of it for promoting the trade of his good &s;ubjects, and protecting tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions which con&s;tituted one great &s;ource of their wealth and commerce. Finally, he exhorted them to compleat their plan for appropriating the forfeited e&s;tates in the Highlands to the &s;ervice of the public. He probably avoided mentioning the encroachments of France, that he might &s;upply no handle for debates on the addre&s;s, which was car|ried in both hou&s;es almo&s;t without oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The government &s;eemed determined to humble the in&s;olence of the French councils; and this di&s;|po&s;ition was &s;o agreeable to the people in general, that they begrudged no expence, and heartily con|curred with the demands of the mini&s;try.</P>

In the cour&s;e of this di&s;|pute, the &s;trength and influence of what they

The candidates &s;u&s;|tained on the &s;houlders of the old intere&s;t, were the lord vi&s;count Wenman, and Sir James Da&s;h|wood; and their competitors, whom the new in|tere&s;t &s;upported, and of con&s;equence the mini&s;try countenanced, were lord Parker and Sir Edward Turner. Never was any contention of this kind maintained with more &s;pirit and animo&s;ity, or car|ried on at a greater expence. One would have imagined that each &s;ide con&s;idered it as a di&s;pute which mu&s;t have determined, whether the nation &s;hould enjoy its antient liberty, or tamely &s;ubmit to the fetters of corruption. Noblemen and gen|tlemen, clergymen and ladies, employed all their talents and indu&s;try in canva&s;&s;ing for either &s;ide, throughout every town&s;hip and village in the county. Scandal emptied her whole quiver of in&s;inuation, calumny, and lampoon; corruption was not remi&s;s in promi&s;es and pre&s;ents: hou&s;es of entertainment were opened; and nothing was for &s;ome time to be &s;een but &s;cenes of tumult, riot, and intoxication. The revenue of many an independent prince on the continent would not have been &s;ufficient to afford &s;uch &s;ums of money as were expended in the cour&s;e of this di&s;pute. At length they proceeded to election, and the &s;heriff made a double return of all the four candidates, &s;o that not one of them could &s;it, and the county remained without a repre&s;entative until this ambi|guous affair could be decided in the hou&s;e of com|mons. About the middle of November petitions being pre&s;ented by the four candidates, as well as

The coun&s;el for lord Wenman and Sir J $$s Da&s;hwood alledg$d, that they had the majority of votes upon the poll; and this circum|&s;tance was admitted by the coun&s;el on the other &s;ide: then they proceeded to prove by evidence, that, after clo&s;ing the poll, the &s;heriff declared the majority of votes to be in favour of the&s;e two candidates, and adjourned the court from the twenty-third day of April to the eighth of May; &s;o that the &s;crutiny demanded, and granted on the behalf of lord Parker and Sir Edward Turner could not be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed before the la&s;t day of the month, when the writ was returnable: that the &s;crutiny did not begin 'till the ninth day of May, when the time was protracted by di&s;putes about the manner in which it &s;hould be carried on; that lord Parker and Sir Edward Turner were allowd to object, through the whole poll, to the votes on the other $i$e, on pretence that their competi|tors &s;hould be permitted to an&s;wer the&s;e objections, and in their turn, object through the whole poll to the voters for lord Parker and Sir Edward Tur|ner, who &s;hould, in the la&s;t place, have leave to an&s;wer: that lord Wenman and Sir James Da&s;h|wood had di&s;approved of this method, becau&s;e they apprehended it might induce their competi|tors to make &s;uch a number of frivolous objections, that they &s;hould not have time to an&s;wer one half of them, much le&s;s to make objections of their own before the writ &s;hould be returned: that, they

The proof being exhibited, the coun&s;el in&s;i&s;ted, that, as they had e&s;tabli&s;hed a majority on the poll, and demon&s;trated that this majority neither was nor could be overthrown by &s;uch an unfini&s;hed &s;crutiny, it was incumbent on the other &s;ide to proceed upon the merits of the election, by en|deavouring to overthrow that majority of which their clients were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. A que&s;tion in the hou&s;e being carried to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, lord Wenman and Sir James Da&s;hwood objected to five hundred and thirty voters on the other &s;ide, whom they propo&s;ed to di&s;qualify. Their coun&s;el exa|mined &s;everal witne&s;&s;es, to prove the partiality of the &s;heriff in favour of lord Parker and Sir Ed|ward Turner, and to detect the&s;e candidates in the practice of bribery; for which purpo&s;e they produced a letter in their own hand-writing. They afterwards proceeded to di&s;qualify particular votes, and &s;ummed up their evidence on the twenty-fir&s;t day of January. Then the coun&s;el for the other &s;ide began to refute the charge of partiality and corruption; and to an&s;wer the ob|jections that had been made to particular voters. They produced evidence to prove, that cu&s;toma|ry freeholds, or cu&s;tomary holdings, had voted at elections in the counties of Glamorgan, Mon|mouth, Glouce&s;ter, Wells, and Hereford; and that the cu&s;tomary tenants of the manor of Wode|&s;tock,
<PB N="240" REF="2490">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> in Oxford&s;hire, had been reputed capable of voting, and even voted at elections for that county. In a word, they continued to examine evidences, argue and refute, prove and di&s;prove, until the twenty-third day of April, when, after &s;ome warm debates and divi&s;ions in the hou&s;e, lord Parker and Sir Edward Turner were declared duly elected; and the clerk of the crown was or|dered to amend the return, by erazing the names of lord Wenman and Sir James Da&s;hwood. Many who pre&s;umed to think for them&s;elves, without recollecting the power and influence of the admi|ni&s;tration, were a&s;toni&s;hed at the i&s;&s;ue of this di&s;|pute; which, however, might have ea&s;ily been fore&s;een; ina&s;much as, during the cour&s;e of the proceedings, mo&s;t, if not all, of the many que&s;tions debated in the hou&s;e, were determined by a great majority in favour of the new intere&s;t. A great number of copy-holders had been admitted to vote at this election, and the &s;heriff incurred no cen&s;ure for allowing them to take the oath appointed by law to be taken by freeholders: neverthele&s;s the commons carefully avoided determining the que|&s;tion, Whether copy-holders, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the yearly value of forty &s;hillings, clear of all deduc|tions, have not a right to vote for knights to re|pre&s;ent the &s;hire within which their copy-hold e&s;tates are &s;ituated? This point being left doubt|ful by the legi&s;lature, puts it often in the power of the &s;heriff to return which of the candidates he plea&s;es to &s;upport; for, if the majority of the voting copy-holders adheres to the intere&s;ts of his favourites, he will admit their votes both on the poll and the &s;crutiny: whereas, &s;hould they be

On this occa&s;ion he him&s;elf was &s;o far impo&s;ed upon by the in&s;tructions he had received, that he believed the profe&s;&s;ions of his court were &s;incere, and &s;eriou&s;ly endeavoured to prevent a rupture between the two nations. At length, however, their preparations were &s;o notorious, that he began to &s;u&s;pect the con&s;equence; and the Engli&s;h mini&s;try produced &s;uch proofs of their in|&s;incerity and double dealing, that he &s;eemed to be &s;truck with a&s;toni&s;hment and chag$in. He re|paired to France, and upbraided the mini&s;try of Ver&s;ailles for having made him the tool of their di&s;&s;imulation.

<P>Though the taking of the&s;e &s;hips, from which the commencement of the war may in fact be dated, fell greatly &s;hort of what was hoped for from this expedition; yet, when the news of it reached England, it was of infinite &s;ervice to the public credit of every kind, and animated the whole na|tion, who now &s;aw plainly that the government was determined to keep no f$rther mea&s;ures with the French, but ju&s;tly to repel force by force, and put a &s;top to their &s;ending more men and arms to invade the property of the Engli&s;h in Ameri|ca, as they had hitherto done with impunity. The French, who, for &s;ome time, did not even at|tempt to make repri&s;als on our &s;hipping, would gladly have cho&s;en to avoid a war at that time, and to have continued extending their incroachments on our &s;ettlements, till they had executed their grand plan of &s;ecuring a communication from the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ipi to Canada by a line of forts, many of which they had already erected, and had al&s;o de|&s;troyed one of our's on the Ohio; whil&s;t they en|deavoured to amu&s;e us with fruitle&s;s negociations about the boundaries of Nova-Scotia.</P>

The re&s;olution of making them was the effect of mature deliberation in the Engli&s;h council. The va&s;t increa&s;e of the French marine of late years, which, in all probabi|lity, would &s;oon be employed again&s;t Great Britain, very properly occa&s;ioned an order for making re|pri&s;als<NOTE PLACE="marg">Orders for mak|ing gene|ral repri|&s;als upon the French.</NOTE> general in Europe as well as in America; and that all the French &s;hips, whether outward or homeward bound, &s;hould be &s;topt and brought in|to Briti&s;h ports.

<P>To give the greater &s;pirit to the Engli&s;h &s;ailors, and to encourage the workmen in the dock yards, his royal highne&s;s the duke of Cumberland went this &s;ummer to Port&s;mouth, where he was received with the greate&s;t honours; and the lord An&s;on, with other lords of the admiralty, vi&s;ited that place, and &s;everal other parts of the kingdom, in order to forward the maritime preparations.</P>

Their outward|bound merchant &s;hips were in&s;ured at the rate of thirty per cent. whil&s;t the Engli&s;h paid no more than

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> the common in&s;urance. This intolerable burden was felt by all degrees of people among&s;t them: their mini&s;try was publicly reviled, even by their parliaments; and the French name, from being the terror, began to be the contempt of Europe. Their unea&s;ine&s;s was al&s;o not a little heightened by new broils between their king and the parliament of Paris, occa&s;ioned by the ob&s;tinacy of the clergy of that kingdom, who &s;eemed determined to &s;up|port the church, in all events, again&s;t the &s;ecular tribunals, and, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to enforce the ob&s;ervance of the bull Unigenitus, which had long been the occa&s;ion of &s;o many di&s;putes among them. However, the parliament continuing firm, and the French king approving of its conduct, the eccle&s;ia&s;tics thought proper to &s;ubmit for the pre&s;ent; and, in their general a&s;&s;embly this year, granted him a free gift of &s;ixteen millions of li|$res, which he demanded of them; a greater &s;um than they had ever given before, even in time of war.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of the Eng|li&s;h in America.</NOTE> In the beginning of this year the a&s;&s;embly of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's Bay in New England pa&s;&s;ed an act, prohibiting all corre&s;pondence with the French at Loui&s;burg; and early in the &s;pring they rai&s;ed a body of troops, which was tran&s;ported to Nova Scotia, to a&s;&s;i&s;t lieutenant-governor Laurence in driving the French from the incroachments they had made upon that province.</P>
<P>Accordingly, towards the end of May, the go|vernor &s;ent a large detachment of troops, under the command of lieutenant-colonel Monkton, upon this &s;ervice; and three frigates and a &s;loop were di&s;patched up the bay of Fundy, under the com|mand

of captain Rous, to give their a&s;&s;i&s;tance by<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> &s;ea. The troops, upon their arrival at the river Ma&s;&s;agua&s;h, found the pa&s;&s;age &s;topt by a large number of regular forces, rebel neutrals, or Aca|dians, and Indians, four hundred and fifty of whom were po&s;ted in a block-hou&s;e, with cannon mount|ed on their &s;ide of the river; and the re&s;t were po&s;ted within a &s;trong brea&s;t-work of timber, thrown up by way of outwork to the block-hou&s;e. The Engli&s;h provincials attacked this place with &s;uch &s;pirit, that, in an hour's time, the enemy were obliged to fly, and leave them in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the brea&s;t-work; whereupon the garri&s;on in the block-hou&s;e de&s;erted it, and left the pa&s;&s;age of the river free. From thence colonel Monkton ad|vanced<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beau-&s;e|jour taken by colonel Monkton.</NOTE> to the French fort of Beau-&s;ejour, which he inve&s;ted, as far at lea&s;t as the &s;mall number of his troops would permit, on the twelfth of June; and, after four days bombardment, he obliged it to &s;urrender, though the French had twenty-&s;ix pieces of cannon mounted, and plenty of ammunition, and the Engli&s;h had not yet placed a &s;ingle can|non upon their batteries. The garri&s;on was &s;ent to Loui&s;bourg, on condition of not bearing arms in America for the &s;pace of &s;ix months; and the Aca|dians, who had joined the French, were pardoned, in con&s;ideration of their having been forced into that &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Colonel Monkton, after putting a garri&s;on into this place, and changing its name into that of Cum|berland. the next day attacked and reduced the other French fort upon the river Ga&s;pereau, which runs into bay Verte; where he likewi&s;e found a large quantity of provi&s;ions and &s;tores of all kinds,

He then di&s;armed the&s;e la&s;t, to the number of fifteen thou&s;and: and, in the mean time, captain Rous with his &s;hips &s;ailed to the mouth of the river St. John, to attack the new fort the French had erected there; but they &s;aved him that trouble, by abandoning it upon his appearance, after bur&s;ting their cannon, blowing up their magazine, and de&s;troying, as far as they had time, all the works they had lately rai&s;ed. The Engli&s;h had but twenty men killed, and about the &s;ame number wounded, in the whole of this expe|dition, the &s;ucce&s;s of which &s;ecured the tranquillity of Nova Scotia.</P>
<P>While the New Englanders were thus employed in reducing the French in Nova Scotia, prepara|tions were made in Virginia for attacking them upon the Ohio. A fort was built, which was like|wi&s;e called Fort Cumberland, and a camp formed, at Wills's Creek; and, on the fourteenth of Ja|nuary<NOTE PLACE="marg">General Brad|dock's un|fortunate expedi|tion.</NOTE> of this year, major-general Braddock, with colonel Dunbar's and colonel Halket's regiments of foot, &s;ailed from Cork in Ireland for Virginia, where they all landed &s;afe before the end of February. This general might con&s;equently have entered up|on action early in the &s;pring, had he not been un|fortunately delayed by the Virginian contractors for the army, who, when he was ready to march, had neither provided a &s;ufficient quantity of provi&s;ions for his troops, nor a competent number of carriages for his army.</P>
<P>This accident was fore&s;een by almo&s;t every per&s;on who knew any thing of our plantations upon the
<PB N="255" REF="2650">
continent of America: for the people of Virginia,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755&punc;</NOTE> who think of no produce but their tobacco, and do not rai&s;e corn enough even for their own &s;ub|&s;i&s;tance, being, by the nature of their country, well provided with the conveniency of water-con|veyance, have but few wheel-carriages, or bea&s;ts of burden; whereas Pen&s;ylvania, which abounds in corn, and mo&s;t other &s;orts of provi&s;ions, has but little water-carriage, e&s;pecially in its we&s;tern &s;ettlements, where its inhabitants have great numbers of carts, waggons, and hor&s;es. Mr. Braddock &s;hould therefore certainly, in point of prudence, have landed in Pen&s;ylvania: the con|tract for &s;upplying his troops &s;hould have been made with &s;ome of the chief planters there, who could ea&s;ily have performed their engagements; and if his camp had been formed near Frank's-town, or &s;omewhere upon the &s;outh-we&s;t borders of that province, he would not have had eighty miles to march from thence to Fort Du Que&s;ne, in&s;tead of an hundred and thirty miles that he had to advance from Wills's Creek, where he did encamp, through roads neither better nor more practicable than the other would have been. This error, in the very beginning of the expedition, whether ow|ing to an injudicious preference fondly given to the Virginians in the lucrative job of &s;upplying the&s;e troops, or to any other cau&s;e, delayed the march of the army for &s;ome weeks, during which it was in the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s for nece&s;&s;aries of all kinds; and would probably have defeated the expedition intirely for that &s;ummer, had not the contractors found means to procure &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the back-&s;ettlements of Pen&s;ylvania. But even when
<PB N="256" REF="2660">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> the&s;e &s;upplies did arrive, they con&s;i&s;ted of only fif|teen waggons, and an hundred draught hor&s;es, in|&s;tead of an hundred and fifty waggons and three hundred hor&s;es, which the Virginian contractors had engaged to furni&s;h, and the provi&s;ions were &s;o bad that they could not be u&s;ed. However, &s;ome gentlemen in Pen&s;ylvania, being applied to in this exigency, amply made up for the&s;e deficiencies, and the troops were by this means &s;upplied with every thing they wanted.</P>
<P>Another, and &s;till more fatal, error was com|mitted in the choice of the commander for this ex|pedition. Major-general Braddock, who was ap|pointed to it, was undoubtedly a man of courage, and expert in all the punctilios of a review, hav|ing been brought up in the Engli&s;h guards; but he was naturally very haughty, po&s;itive, and diffi|cult of acce&s;s; qualities ill &s;uited to the temper of the people among&s;t whom he was to command. His extreme &s;everity in matters of di&s;cipline had always made his &s;oldiers di&s;like him; and the &s;trict military education in which he had been trained from his youth, and which he prided him&s;elf on &s;trictly following, made him hold the American militia in great contempt, becau&s;e they could not go through their exerci&s;e with the &s;ame dexterity and regularity as a regiment of guards in Hyde-Park, little knowing, or indeed being able to form any idea of the difference between the European manner of fighting, and an American expedition through woods, de&s;erts, and mora&s;&s;es. Before he left England, he received, in the hand-writing of colonel Napier, a &s;et of in&s;tructions from the duke of Cumberland, which did honour to the military
<PB N="257" REF="2670">
&s;kill of that prince. By the&s;e in&s;tructions, the at|tempt<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> upon Niagara was, in a great mea&s;ure, re|ferred to him; and the reduction of Crown-Point was to be left chiefly to the provincial forces. But, above all, his royal highne&s;s, both verbally and in this writing, frequently cautioned him carefully to beware of an ambu&s;h or &s;urprize. In&s;tead of regard|ing this &s;ulutary caution, his conceit of his own abilities made him di&s;dain to a&s;k the opinion of any under his command; and the Indians, who would have been his &s;afe&s;t guards again&s;t his danger in particular, were &s;o di&s;gu&s;ted by the haughtine&s;s of his behaviour, that mo&s;t of them for&s;ook his ban|ners.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His in|cautious march towards Fort Du Que&s;ne.</NOTE> Under the&s;e di&s;advantages he began his march from Fort Cumberland on the tenth of June, at the head of about two thou&s;and two hundred men, for the Meadows, where colonel Wa&s;hington was defeated the year before. Upon his arrival there, he was informed, that the French at Fort Du Que&s;ne, which had lately been built on the &s;ame river, near its confluence with the Monangahela, expected a reinforcement of five hundred regular troops: therefore, that he might march with the greater di&s;patch, he left colonel Dunbar, with eight hun|dred men, to bring up the provi&s;ions, &s;tores, and heavy baggage, as fa&s;t as the nature of the &s;ervice would permit; and with the other twelve hundred, together with ten pieces of cannon, and the nece&s;|&s;ary ammunition and provi&s;ions, he marched on with &s;o much expedition, that he &s;eldom took any time to reconnoitre the woods or thickets he was to pa&s;s through; as if the nearer he approached the enemy, the farther he was removed from danger.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="2680">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> On the eighth of July, he encamped within ten miles of fort Du Que&s;ne; and though colonel Dun|bar was then near forty miles behind him, and his officers, particularly Sir Peter Halket, earne&s;tly in|treated him to proceed with caution, and to em|ploy the friendly Indians that were with him, by way of advanced guard, in ca&s;e of ambu&s;cades; yet he re&s;umed his march the next day, without &s;o much as endeavouring to get any intelligence of the &s;ituation or di&s;po&s;ition of the enemy, or even &s;ending out any &s;couts to vi&s;it the woods and thickets then on both &s;ides of him, as well as in his front. With this carle&s;&s;ne&s;s he was advancing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He falls into an ambu&s;|cade.</NOTE> when, about noon, he was &s;aluted with a general fire upon his front, and all along his left flank, from an enemy &s;o artfully concealed behind the trees and bu&s;hes that not a man of them could be &s;een, and who had cunningly given the whole army time to enter the defile before they began to fire. The van-guard immediately fell back upon the main body, and in an in&s;tant the pannic and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is de|feated.</NOTE> confu&s;ion, particularly of the regulars, became ge|neral; &s;o that mo&s;t of them fled with great precipi|tation, notwith&s;tanding all that their officers, &s;ome of whom behaved very gallantly, could do to &s;top their career. As to Braddock him&s;elf, he di&s;covered at once the greate&s;t intrepidity, and the highe&s;t im|prudence; for, in&s;tead of ordering a retreat till he could &s;cour the thickets and bu&s;hes from whence the fire came, with grape-&s;hot from the ten pieces of cannon he had with him, or ordering flanking par|ties of his Indians to advance again&s;t the enemy, he ob&s;tinately continued upon the &s;pot where he was and gave orders for the few brave officers and men who remained with him, to form regularly and
<PB N="259" REF="2690">
advance. While this was doing, his men fell thick<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> about him, and almo&s;t all his officers were &s;ingled out, one after another, and killed or wounded; for the Indians, who always take aim when they fire, and aim chiefly at the officers, di&s;tingui&s;hed them by their dre&s;s. At la&s;t the general, who&s;e ob&s;tinacy &s;eemed to increa&s;e with the danger, after having had five hor&s;es &s;hot under him, received him&s;elf a mu&s;ket-&s;hot thro' the right arm and lungs, of which he died four days after, having been car|ried off the field by the bravery of lieutenant colonel<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is killed.</NOTE> Gage, and another of his officers. When he drop|ped, the confu&s;ion of the few that remained, turned into a downright and very di&s;orderly flight, though no enemy appeared, or attempted to attack them. All the artillery, ammunition, and baggage of the army were left to the enemy, and among the re&s;t the general's cabinet, with all his letters and in|&s;tructions, which the French court afterwards made great u&s;e of in their printed memorials or manife&s;|toes. But what was very extraordinary, the pro|vincial militia, &s;o much de&s;pi&s;ed by the general, that he made them march always in the rear, not only were le&s;s affected with the pannic, and pre&s;erved their order better than the regular troops, though the enemy's fire fell as heavy upon them as upon any of the re&s;t, but even offered to cover the fugi|tives: and when the latter refu&s;ed to &s;tand their ground, &s;aying, that though they were willing to advance again&s;t an open enemy, they would not ru&s;h blindly on again&s;t brakes and bu&s;hes that were lined with un&s;een de&s;truction; the former alone bravely formed, and advanced again&s;t the In|dians: to which gallantry it was owing that the regulars were not all cut off. The lo&s;s of the Eng|li&s;h
<PB N="260" REF="2700">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> in this unhappy affair amounted to &s;even hun|dred men. Their officers, in particular, &s;uffered much more than in the ordinary proportion of battles in Europe. Sir Peter Halket fell by the very fir&s;t fire, at the head of his regiment; and the general's &s;ecretary, &s;on to governor Shirley, was killed &s;oon after. Neither the number of men which the enemy had in this engagement, nor the lo&s;s which they &s;u&s;tained, could be &s;o much as gue&s;&s;ed at: but the French afterwards gave out that their number did not, in the whole, exceed four hun|dred men, mo&s;tly Indians; and that their lo&s;s was quite incon&s;iderable, as it probably was, becau&s;e they lay concealed in &s;uch a manner that the Eng|li&s;h knew not whither to point their mu&s;kets. The pannic of the&s;e la&s;t continued &s;o long, that they never &s;topped till they met the rear divi&s;ion; and even then they infected tho&s;e troops with their ter|rors; &s;o that the army retreated without &s;topping, till they reached fort Cumberland, though the ene|my did not &s;o much as attempt to pur&s;ue, nor ever appeared in &s;ight, either in the battle, or after the defeat.

<P>The former of the&s;e expeditions was appointed to be executed under the command of colonel, now general John&s;on, a native of Ireland, who had long re&s;ided upon the Mohock river, in the we&s;tern parts of New York, where he had acquired a con&s;iderable e&s;tate, and was univer&s;ally beloved, not only by the inhabitants, but al&s;o by the neighbouring Indians, who&s;e language he had learnt, and who&s;e affections he had gained by his humanity towards them.

<P>The rendezvous of the troops for both the&s;e ex|peditions was appointed to be at Albany, where mo&s;t of them arrived before the end of June: but the artillery, battoes, provi&s;ions, and other nece&s;&s;a|ries for the attempt upon Crown-Point, could not be prepared until the eighth of Augu&s;t, when general John&s;on &s;et out with them from Albany for the Carrying-place, from Hud&s;on's river to lake George, where the troops had already arrived, under the command of major-general Lyman, and con&s;i&s;ted of between five and &s;ix thou&s;and men, be&s;ides Indians, rai&s;ed by the governments of Bo&s;|ton, Connecticut, New Hamp&s;hire, Rhode I&s;land, and New York.

Whil&s;t he was thus en|camped, &s;ome of his Indian &s;couts&punc; of which he took care to &s;end out numbers along both &s;ides, and to the farther end of Lake George, brought him intelligence that a con&s;iderable number of the enemy were then on their march from Ticonde|roga, by the way of the &s;outh Bay, towards the fortified encampment, &s;ince called Fort Edward, which general Lyman had built at the Carrying-place, and in which four or five hundred of the New Hamp&s;hite and New York men had been left as a garri&s;on.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Where he is attack|ed by the French</NOTE> The re&s;olution of the council being unanimou&s;|ly agreed to, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning a thou&s;and men, with upwards of two hundred Indians, were detached under the com|mand of colonel Williams: but they had not been gone two hours when tho&s;e in the camp begun to hear a clo&s;e firing, at about three or four miles di&s;|tance, as they judged: as it approached nearer and nearer, they rightly &s;uppo&s;ed that their detach|ment was overpowered, and retreating towards the camp; which was &s;oon confirmed by &s;ome fugi|tives, and pre&s;ently after by whole companies, who fled back in great confu&s;ion.

<P>The French, who&s;e numbers, at the beginning of this engagement, amounted to about two thou|&s;and men, including two hundred grenadiers, eight hundred Canadians, and the re&s;t Indians of different nations, had between &s;even and eight hundred men killed, and thirty taken pri&s;oners: among the&s;e la&s;t was baron Die&s;kau him&s;elf, who was found at a little di&s;tance from the field of battle dangerou&s;ly wounded, and leaning on the &s;tump of a tree for his &s;upport. The Engli&s;h lo&s;t about two hundred men, and tho&s;e chiefly of the detachment under colonel Williams; for they had very few either killed or wounded in the attack upon their camp, and not any of di&s;tinction, except colonel Titcomb killed, and the general him&s;elf and major Nichols wounded. Among the &s;lain of the detachment, which would probably have been almo&s;t intirely cut off, had not lieutenant&punc;colonel Cole been &s;ent out from the camp with three hun|dred men, with which he &s;topt the enemy's pur&s;uit, and covered the retreat of his friends, were colonel Williams, major A&s;hley, &s;ix captains, and &s;everal &s;ubalterns, be&s;ides private men; and the Indians reckoned that they had lo&s;t forty men, be&s;ides the brave old Hendrick, the Mohock Sachem, or chief captain.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> for it could neither have proceeded farther, nor have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted where it was, and he might have found an opportunity to attack it with great advan|tage in its retreat. But when he was within four or five miles of that fort, his people were informed that there were &s;everal cannon there, and none at the camp; upon which they all de&s;ired to be led on to this la&s;t, which he the more readily con&s;ented to, as he him&s;elf had been told by an Engli&s;h pri|&s;oner, who had left this camp but a few days be|fore, that it was quite defencele&s;s, being without any lines, and de&s;titute of cannon; which, in effect, was true at that time; for the cannon did not ar|rive, nor was the brea&s;t-work erected, till about two days before the engagement. To this mi&s;in|formation, therefore, mu&s;t be imputed this &s;tep, which would otherwi&s;e be incon&s;i&s;tent with the ge|nerally allowed character and abilities of baron Die&s;kau.

This<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bravery of captain M`Gin|nes.</NOTE> party fell in with between three and four hun|dred men of Die&s;kau's troops, near the &s;pot where colonel Williams had been defeated the day before: but M`Ginnes, having timely notice by

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;crip|tion of Fort O&s;|wego.</NOTE> O&s;wego lies on the &s;outh-ea&s;t &s;ide of the lake Ontario, near three hundred miles almo&s;t due-we&s;t from Albany in New York. The way to it from thence, though long and tedious, is the more con|venient, as the far greate&s;t part of it admits of water-carriage, by what the inhabitants call bat|toes, which is a kind of light flat-bottomed boat, wide&s;t in the middle, and pointed at each end, of about fifteen hundred weight burden, and ma|naged by two men, called battoe-men, with pad|dles and &s;etting-poles, the rivers being in many places too narrow to admit of oars. From Albany to the village of Shenectady, whch is &s;ixteen miles, is a good waggon-road. From thence to the little Falls in the Mohock river, being &s;ixty-five miles, the pa&s;&s;age is by water-carriage up that river, and con&s;equently again&s;t the &s;tream, which in many places is &s;omewhat rapid, and in others &s;o &s;hallow, that, when the river is low, the watermen are obliged to get out, and draw their battoes over the rifts. At the little Falls is a po&s;tage, or land-carriage, for about a mile, over a ground &s;o mar&s;hy, that it will not bear any wheel-carriage: but a colony of Germans, &s;ettled there, attend with &s;ledges, on which they draw the loaded battoes to the next place of embarkation upon the &s;ame river.
<PB N="271" REF="2810">
From thence they proceed by water up that river,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> for fifty miles, to the Carrying-place, near the head of it, where there is another po&s;tage, the length of which depends upon the dryne&s;s or wetne&s;s of the &s;ea&s;on, but is generally above &s;ix or eight miles over in the &s;ummer months. Here the battoes are again carried upon &s;ledges, till they come to a nar|row river called Wood's Creek, down which they are wafted on a gentle &s;tream, for about forty miles, into the lake Oneyada, which &s;tretches from ea&s;t to we&s;t about thirty miles, and is pa&s;&s;ed with great ea&s;e and &s;afety in calm weather. At the we&s;tern end of this lake is the river Onondaga, which after a cour&s;e of between twenty and thirty miles, unites with the river Cayuga, or Seneca, and their united &s;tream runs into the lake Ontario, at the place where O&s;wego-fort is &s;ituated. But this river is &s;o rapid as to be &s;ometimes dangerous, be&s;ides its being full of rifts and rocks; and about twelve miles on this &s;ide of O&s;wego there is a fall of eleven feet perpendicular, where there is con&s;e|quently a po&s;tage, which, however, does not ex|ceed forty yards.

There is a commu|nication between this lake and that of the Hurons by the river Tana&s;uate, from whence it is a land-carriage of &s;ix or eight leagues to the river To|ronto, which falls into it. The French have two forts of con&s;equence on this lake; Frontignac,

The court of Vienna, who&s;e favourite mea&s;ure this was, began to li&s;ten to D'Aubeterre's in&s;inuations, and, by degrees, entered into nego|tiations with him, which, in the end, were pro|ductive of that unnatural confederacy between the Empre&s;s-queen and the king of France; of which farther notice will be taken in the occurrences of the next year, when the treaty between them, into which they afterwards found means &s;ecretly to bring the empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, was concluded at Ver|&s;ailles.</P>
<P>As it could not be doubted, even at the time of his Britannic maje&s;ty's &s;etting out for his German dominions, that the French would endeavour to invade Hanover, in ca&s;e of a war between England and them, which &s;eemed not only unavoidable, but near at hand; it was natural, that his maje&s;ty &s;hould endeavour to defend his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions by the mo&s;t powerful alliances he could form on the continent. To this end, during his &s;tay at Hano|ver,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Treaty of the king of Great Britain with the landgrave of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el.</NOTE> he concluded, on the eighteenth of June, a treaty with the landgrave of He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el, by which his &s;erene highne&s;s engaged to hold in readine&s;s, during four years, for his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, a body of eight thou&s;and men, to be employed, if re|quired, upon the continent, or in Britain or Ire|land;

The king, on his &s;ide, promi&s;ed to pay to the landgrave, for the&s;e &s;uccours, eighty crowns banco, by way of levy-money, for every trooper or dragoon duly armed and mounted, and thirty crowns banco for every foot-&s;oldier; the crown to be reckoned at fifty-three &s;ols of Holland, or at four &s;hillings and nine pence three farthings Engli&s;h money: and al&s;o to pay to his &s;erene highne&s;s, for the eight thou&s;and men, an annual &s;ub&s;idy of an hundred and fifty thou&s;and crowns banco, during the four years, to commence from the day of &s;igning the treaty; which &s;ub&s;idy was to be increa&s;ed to three hundred thou&s;and crowns yearly, from the time of requiring the troops, to the time of their entering into Briti&s;h pay; and in ca&s;e of their being di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed, the &s;aid &s;ub&s;idy of three hundred thou&s;and crowns was then to revive, and be continued during the re&s;idue of the term: but if twelve thou|&s;and men were demanded and furni&s;hed, the &s;ub|&s;idy was then to be increa&s;ed in proportion: and in ca&s;e the king of Great Britain &s;hould at any time think $it to &s;end back the&s;e troops, before the ex|piration of the treaty, notice thereof was to be given to his &s;erene highne&s;s three months before-hand; one month's pay was to be allowed them

<P>Another treaty was begun with Ru&s;&s;ia about the &s;ame time; but this did not take effect during his maje&s;ty's re&s;idence at Hanover: that others were not concluded was the mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing, as our &s;ub|&s;idy treaty with Saxony had then expired, and that with Bavaria was near expiring; and as the &s;e|curing of the&s;e two princes in our intere&s;t was at lea&s;t as nece&s;&s;ary towards forming a &s;ufficient con|federacy upon the continent for the defence of Hanover, as it was to &s;ecure the landgrave of He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el. If the rea&s;on of their not being engaged, and no other &s;eems &s;o probable, was, that they re|fu&s;ed to renew their treaties with England upon any terms, all that can be &s;aid is, that they were guilty of flagrant ingratitude, as they had both received a &s;ub&s;idy from this kingdom for many years in time of peace, when they neither were nor could be of any &s;ervice to the intere&s;t of Great Britain.</P>

<P>It mu&s;t, however, be confe&s;&s;ed, that the words and &s;tipulation in the above recited clau&s;e, in the &s;eventh article of the treaty of Great Britain with Ru&s;&s;ia, could not but be looked upon as a menace levelled at the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, who, having &s;ome<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spirited declara|tion of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, in con&s;e|quence of our treaty with Ru&s;|&s;ia.</NOTE> time after found means to procure a copy of this treaty, and &s;eeing it in that light, boldly declared, by his mini&s;ters at all the courts of Europe, that he would oppo&s;e with his utmo&s;t force the entrance of any foreign troops into the empire, under any pretence whatever. This declaration was particu|larly di&s;plea&s;ing to the French, who had already marched large bodies of troops towards the fron|tiers of the empire, and erected &s;everal great ma|gazines in We&s;tphalia, with the permi&s;&s;ion of the elector of Cologne, for which our mini&s;ter at his court was, in Augu&s;t, ordered to withdraw from thence without taking leave.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> as this declaration of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia was noti|fied to the court of Ver&s;ailles, they &s;ent an amba&s;|&s;ador extraordinary, the duke de Nivernois, to Berlin, to try to pur&s;uade his maje&s;ty to retract his declaration, and enter into a new alliance with them. His Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty received this amba&s;&s;a|dor in &s;uch a manner, as &s;eemed to denote a di&s;po|&s;ition to agree to every thing he had to propo&s;e. This awakened in England a jealou&s;y that his decla|ration alone was not to be relied on, but that it was nece&s;&s;ary to bring him under &s;ome more &s;olemn engagement; e&s;pecially as the French had by this time a numerous army near the Lower Rhine, with magazines provided for their march all the way to Hanover; and if the king of Pru&s;&s;ia &s;uffered them to pa&s;s through his dominions, that electorate mu&s;t be &s;wallowed up before the Ru&s;&s;ian auxili|aries could po&s;&s;ibly be brought thither, or any army be formed for protecting it. For this rea&s;on<NOTE PLACE="marg">A treaty between England and Pru&s;|&s;ia begun.</NOTE> a negotiation was &s;et on foot by Great Britain at Ber|lin; but as it was not concluded before the beginning of the next year, we &s;hall defer entering into the par|ticulars of it, till we come to that period.</P>

When the news of this great calamity fir&s;t reached England, it was feared le&s;t the con&s;e|quences of it might affect our public credit, con|&s;idering the va&s;t intere&s;t which the Engli&s;h mer|chants had in the Portugue&s;e trade: but, fortu|nately, it afterwards proved incon&s;iderable, in com|pari&s;on of what had been apprehended; the quar|ter in which the Engli&s;h chiefly lived, and where they had their warehou&s;es, having &s;uffered the lea&s;t of any part of the city; and mo&s;t of the Eng|li&s;h merchants then re&s;iding there, together with their families, being at their country hou&s;es, to avoid the in&s;ults to which they might have been expo&s;ed from the Portugue&s;e populace, during the celebration of their Auto da fe, which was kept that very day.

But what entirely completed the ruin of this then mo&s;t opulent capital of the Portugue&s;e dominions, was a devouring conflagration, partly fortuitous or natural, but chiefly occa&s;ioned by a &s;et of imp ous villains, who, unawed by the tremendous &s;cene at that very in&s;tant pa&s;&s;ing before their eyes, with a wickedne&s;s &s;carcely to be credited, &s;et fire even to the falling edifices in different parts of the city, to increa&s;e the general confu&s;ion, that they might have the better opportunity to rob and plunder their already de&s;olated fellow-citizens. Out of three hundred and fifty thou&s;and inhabitants, which Lisbon was then &s;uppo&s;ed to contain, about ten thou&s;and peri&s;hed by this calamity; and the &s;urvi|vors, deprived of their habitations, and de&s;titute even of the nece&s;&s;aries of life, were forced to &s;eek for &s;helter in the open fields.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Letter from M.

He complained of the in&s;ult which had been offered to his ma&s;ter's flag, in attacking and taking two of his &s;hips in the open &s;ea, without any pre|vious declaration of war; as al&s;o by committing depredations on the commerce of his mo&s;t Chri&s;|tian maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, in contempt of the law of nations, the faith of treaties, and the u&s;ages e&s;tabli&s;hed among civilized nations. He &s;aid, the &s;entiments and character of his Britannic maje&s;ty gave the king his ma&s;ter room to expect, that, at his return to London, he would di&s;avow the con|duct of his admiralty; but &s;eeing that, in&s;tead of puni&s;hing, he rather encouraged tho&s;e who had been guilty of &s;uch depredations, his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian maje&s;ty would be deemed deficient in what he owed to his own glory, the dignity of his crown,
<PB N="305" REF="3170">
and the defence of his people, if he deferred any<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> longer demanding a &s;ignal reparation for the out|rage done to the French flag, and the damage &s;u&s;|tained by his &s;ubjects. He therefore demanded immediate and full re&s;titution of all the French &s;hips, which, contrary to law and decorum, had been taken by the Engli&s;h navy, together with all the officers, &s;oldiers, mariners, guns, &s;tores, and merchandize. He declared, that &s;hould this re&s;ti|tution be made, he &s;hould be willing to engage in a negotiation for what further &s;atisfaction he might claim, and continue de&s;irous to &s;ee the differences relating to America determined by a &s;olid and equitable accommodation: but if, contrary to all hopes, the&s;e demands &s;hould be rejected, he would con&s;ider &s;uch a denial of ju&s;tice as the mo&s;t authen|tic declaration of war, and as a formed de&s;ign in the court of London to di&s;turb the peace of Eu|rope.</P>
<P>To this peremptory remon&s;trance the Briti&s;h &s;ecretary was directed to an&s;wer, That though the king of England would readily con&s;ent to an equit|able and &s;olid accommodation, he would not com|ply with the demand of immediate and full re&s;titu|tion as a preliminary condition; for his maje&s;ty had taken no &s;teps but &s;uch as were rendered ju&s;t and indi&s;pen&s;ible by the ho&s;tilities which the French began in time of profound peace, and a proper regard for his own honour, the rights and po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions of his crown, and the &s;ecurity of his king|doms.</P>
<P>Without all doubt the late tran&s;actions had af|forded &s;pecious arguments for both nations to im|peach the conduct of each other. The French

They likewi&s;e inveighed again&s;t the capture of their &s;hips, before any declaration of war, as flagrant acts of piracy; and &s;ome neu|tral powers of Europe &s;eemed to con&s;ider them in the &s;ame point of view.</P>
<P>It was certainly high time to check the in&s;olence of the French by force of arms, and &s;urely this might have been as effectually and expeditiou&s;ly exerted under the u&s;ual &s;anction of a formal decla|ration; the omi&s;&s;ion of which expo&s;ed the admi|ni&s;tration to the cen&s;ure of our neighbours, and fixed the imputation of fraud and free-booting on the beginning of the war. The mini&s;try was &s;aid to have delayed the ceremony of denouncing war from political con&s;iderations, &s;uppo&s;ing that, &s;hould the French be provoked into the fir&s;t declaration of this kind, the powers of Europe would con&s;ider his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian maje&s;ty as the aggre&s;&s;or, and Great Britain would reap all the fruits of the defen|five alliances in which &s;he had engaged. But nothing could be more weak and frivolous than &s;uch a conjecture; the aggre&s;&s;or is he who fir&s;t violates the peace; and every ally will interpret the aggre&s;&s;ion according to his own intere&s;t and convenience. The admini&s;tration maintained the appearance of candour in the mid&s;t of their ho&s;tilities. The merchant &s;hips, of which a great num|ber had been taken from the French, were not &s;old

In this particular, however, it was p$y that a little common &s;en&s;e had not been blended with their honourable intention. Great part of the cargoes con&s;i&s;ted of fi&s;h, and other peri&s;hable com|modities, which were left to $ot and putre&s;y, and afterwards thrown overboard to prevent contagion; &s;o that the owners and captors were equally di&s;ap|pointed, and the value of them lo&s;t to both na|tions.</P>
<P>The court of Ver&s;ailles, while they pre&s;ented re|mon&s;trances which they knew would prove inef|fectual, and exclaimed again&s;t the conduct of Great Britain with all the arts of calumny and exaggera|tion at every court in Chri&s;tendom, continued ne|verthele&s;s to make &s;uch preparations as denoted a de&s;ign to pro&s;ecute the war with uncommon vigour. They began to repair and fortify Dunkirk: orders were publi&s;hed, that all Briti&s;h &s;ubjects &s;hould quit the dominions of France: many Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;els were &s;eized in different ports of that kingdom, and their crews &s;ent to pri&s;on. At the &s;ame time an<NOTE PLACE="marg">The French threaten Great Bri|tain with an inva|&s;ion.</NOTE> edict was i&s;&s;ued, inviting the French &s;ubjects to equip privateers, offering a premium of forty livres for every gun, and as much for every man they &s;hould take from the enemy; and promi&s;ing that, in ca&s;e a peace &s;hould be &s;peedily concluded, the king would purcha&s;e the privateers at prime co&s;t.

Mon&s;ieur d'Affry, the French king's mini&s;ter at the Hague, having received intimation of this de|mand, produced a counter memorial from his ma&s;ter, charging the Engli&s;h as the aggre&s;&s;ors, and giving the States General plainly to under|&s;tand, that &s;hould they grant the &s;uccours de|manded by Great Britain, he would con&s;ider their compliance as an act of ho&s;tility again&s;t him&s;elf. The Dutch, though divided among them&s;elves by faction, were unanimou&s;ly aver&s;e to any mea&s;ure that might involve them in the approaching war. Their commerce was in a great mea&s;ure decayed, and their finances were too much exhau&s;ted to ad|mit of an immediate augmentation of their forces, which for many other rea&s;ons they &s;trove to avoid. They fore&s;aw a great increa&s;e of trade in their ad|hering to a punctual neutrality: they were afraid of the French by land, and jealous of the Engli&s;h by &s;ea; and perhaps enjoyed the pro&s;pect of &s;eeing the&s;e two proud and powerful nations humble and impoveri&s;h each other. Certain it is, the States General protracted their an&s;wer to Mr. Yorke's
<PB N="309" REF="3210">
memorial by &s;uch affected delays, that the court of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> London perceived their intention, and in order to avoid the mortification of a flat denial, the king or|dered his re&s;ident to acquaint the prince&s;s regent, that he would not in&s;i&s;t upon his demand. The States, thus freed from their perplexity, at length de|livered an an&s;wer to Mr. Yorke, in which they ex|patiated on the difficulties they were laid under, and thanked his Britannic maje&s;ty for having freed them by his declaration from that embarra&s;&s;ment into which they were thrown by his fir&s;t demand and the counter memorial of the French mini&s;ter. The real &s;entiments of tho&s;e people, however, more plainly appeared in the previous re&s;olution delivered to the &s;tates of Holland by the towns of Am&s;terdam, Dort, Haerlem, Gouda, Rotterdam, and Enckhuy&s;en, declaring flatly that England was uncontrovertibly the aggre&s;&s;or in Europe, by &s;eizing a con&s;iderable number of French ve&s;&s;els; that the threatened inva&s;ion of Great Britain did not affect the republic's guarantee of the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, ina&s;much as it was only intended to ob|tain reparation for the injury &s;u&s;tained by the &s;ub|jects of his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian maje&s;ty; finally, that the &s;uccours demanded could be of no advantage to the king of England, as it appeared by the declaration of his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian maje&s;ty, that their granting the&s;e &s;uccours would immediately lay them under a nece&s;&s;ity of demanding, in their turn, a&s;&s;i&s;tance from Great Britain. From this way of arguing, the Engli&s;h may perceive what they have to expect in ca&s;es of emergency from the friend&s;hip of their neare&s;t allies, who mu&s;t always be furni&s;hed with the &s;ame excu&s;e whenever they find it convenient

Such a con&s;ide|ration, joined to other concurring motives, ought to induce the Briti&s;h legi&s;lature to withdraw its de|pendence from all foreign connexions, and provide &s;uch a con&s;titutional force within it&s;elf, as will be fully &s;ufficient to baffle all the efforts of an external enemy. The apprehen&s;ions and di&s;traction of the people at this juncture plainly evinced the expedi|ency of &s;uch a national force: but different parties were divided in their opinions about the nature of &s;uch a provi&s;ion. Some of the warme&s;t friends of their country propo&s;ed a well-regulated militia, as an in&s;titution that would effectually an&s;wer the pur|po&s;e of defending a wide extended &s;ea-coa&s;t from inva&s;ion; while on the other hand, this propo&s;al was ridiculed and refuted as impracticable or u&s;ele&s;s by all the retainers to the court, and all the officers of the &s;tanding army. In the mean time, as the experiment could not be immediately tried, and the pre&s;ent juncture demanded &s;ome in&s;tant deter|mination, recour&s;e was had to a foreign remedy.</P>

<PB N="311" REF="3230">
for putting his kingdom in a po&s;ture of defence:<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> that, in order further to &s;trengthen him&s;elf, he had made a requi&s;ition of a body of He&s;&s;ian troops, pur|&s;uant to the late treaty, to be forthwith brought over, and for that purpo&s;e ordered tran&s;ports to be prepared: that he doubted not of being enabled and &s;upported by his parliament in taking all &s;uch mea&s;ures as might be conducive to an end &s;o e&s;&s;en|tial to the honour of his crown, the pre&s;ervation of the prote&s;tant religion, and the laws and liberties of the&s;e kingdoms.

<P>Even this precaution was not thought &s;ufficient to &s;ecure the i&s;land, and quiet the terrors of the people. In a few days Mr. Fox, the new mini&s;ter, encouraged by the unanimity which had appeared &s;o con&s;picuous in the motions for the late ad|dre&s;&s;es, ventured to move again, in the hou&s;e of commons, that another addre&s;s &s;hould be pre&s;ented to the king, be&s;eeching his maje&s;ty, that for the more effectual defence of this i&s;land, and for the better &s;ecurity of the religion and liberties of his &s;ubjects, again&s;t the threatened attack by a foreign enemy, he would be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to order twelve battalions of his electoral troops, together with the u&s;ual detachment of artillery, to be forth|with brought into this kingdom. There was a con&s;iderable party in the hou&s;e, to whom &s;uch a

As the fears of an inva&s;ion &s;ub|&s;ided in the minds of the people, their antipathy to the&s;e foreign auxiliaries emerged. They were be|held with the eyes of jealou&s;y, &s;u&s;picion, and di&s;|dain. They were treated with contempt, re&s;erve, and rigour. The mini&s;try was execrated for hav|ing reduced the nation to &s;uch a low circum&s;tance of di&s;grace, as that they &s;hould owe their &s;ecurity to German mercenaries.

In a word, the doubts and &s;u&s;picions of a people naturally blunt and jealous, were in|flamed to &s;uch a degree of animo&s;ity, that nothing would have re&s;trained them from violent acts of outrage, but the mo&s;t orderly, mode&s;t, and in|offen|&s;ive

<P>Under the cloak of an invading armament, which engro&s;&s;ed the attention of the Briti&s;h nation, the French were actually employed in preparations for an expedition, which &s;ucceeded according to their wi&s;h. In the beginning of the year advice was received that a French &s;quadron would &s;oon be in a condition to $ail from Toulon: this was after|wards<NOTE PLACE="marg">French prepara|tions at Toulon.</NOTE> confirmed by repeated intelligence not only from foreign gazettes, but al&s;o from Engli&s;h mi|ni&s;ters and con&s;uls re&s;iding in Spain and Italy. They affirmed that the Toulon &s;quadron con&s;i&s;ted of twelve or fifteen &s;hips of the line, with a great number of tran&s;ports; that they were &s;upplied with provi&s;ion for two months only, con&s;equently could not be intended for America; and that &s;trong bodies of troops were on their march from different parts of the French dominions to Dauphin&eacute; and Provence&punc; in order to be embarked. Notwith|&s;tanding the&s;e particulars of information, which plainly pointed out Minorca as the object of their expedition; notwith&s;tanding the exten&s;ive and im|portant commerce carried on by the &s;ubjects of Great Britain in the Mediterranean; no care was taken to &s;end thither a &s;quadron of &s;hips capable to protect the trade, and fru&s;trate the de&s;igns of the enemy. That great province was left to a few incon&s;iderable &s;hips and frigates, which could &s;erve no other purpo&s;e than that of carrying intelligence from port to port, and enriching their com|manders by making prize of merchant ve&s;&s;els.

His zeal for the honour and &s;ervice of his country immediately triumph|ed over the calls of tenderne&s;s and of nature. He expended a con&s;iderable &s;um of money in purcha&s;ing timber for the platforms, and other nece&s;&s;a|ries for the garri&s;on; hired a &s;hip for tran&s;porting them thi|ther; and tearing him&s;elf from his wife and children, thus left among &s;trangers in a foreign country, embarked again for Mino$$a, where he knew he would be in a peculiar man|ner expo&s;ed to all the dangers of a furious &s;iege.

His behaviour was &s;o acceptable to his &s;overeign, that when he returned to Eng|land he was preferred to the rank of colonel in the guards.

He ob&s;erved, that &s;uch engineers and artillery-men in Gibraltar, as had been at Minorca, were of opinion, that it would be impo&s;&s;ible to throw any number of men into St. Philip's, if the French had erected batteries on the two &s;hores near the entrance of the harbour, &s;o as to bar all pa&s;&s;age up to the &s;ally port of the for|tre&s;s; and with this opinion he &s;ignified the con|currence of his own &s;entiments.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> The fir&s;t part of this letter was a downright im|peachment of the mini&s;try, for having delayed the expedition, for having &s;ent out &s;hips unfit for &s;er|vice, and for having neglected the magazines and wharfs at Gibraltar. In the latter part he &s;eemed to prepare them for the &s;ub&s;equent account of his mi&s;conduct and mi&s;carriage.

<P>This admiral, being &s;trengthened by Mr. Edge|cumbe, and reinforced by a detachment from the garri&s;on, &s;et &s;ail from Gibraltar on the eighth day of May, and was joined off Majorca by his ma|je&s;ty's &s;hip the Phoenix, under the command of captain Hervey, who confirmed the intelligence he had already received, touching the &s;trength and de&s;tination of the French &s;quadron. When he ap|proached Minorca, he de&s;cried the Briti&s;h colours &s;till flying at the ca&s;tle of St. Philip's, and &s;everal bomb batteries playing upon it from different quarters, where the French banners were di&s;played.

Before this attempt could

be made, the French fleet appearing to the &s;outh|ea&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> and the wind blowing &s;trong off &s;hore, he re|called<NOTE PLACE="marg">Falls in with the French fleet off Minorca.</NOTE> the &s;hips, and formed the line of battle. About &s;ix o'clock in the evening the enemy, to the number of &s;eventeen &s;hips, thirteen of which ap|peared to be very large, advanced in order; but about &s;even tacked, with a view to gain the weather|gage. Mr. Byng, in order to pre&s;erve that ad|vantage, as well as to make &s;ure of the land-wind in the morning, followed their example, being then about five leagues from Cape Mola.</P>
<P>At day-light the enemy could not be de&s;cribed; but two tartanes appearing clo&s;e to the rear of the Engli&s;h &s;quadron, they were immediately chaced by &s;ignal. One e&s;caped; and the other being taken, was found to have on board two French captains, two lieutenants, and about one hundred private &s;oldiers, part of &s;ix hundred who had been &s;ent out in tartanes the preceding day, to reinforce the enemy's &s;quadron. This &s;oon re-appearing, the line of battle was formed on each &s;ide; and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Engage|ment with La Gali&s;|&s;ionere.</NOTE> about two o'clock admiral Byng threw out a &s;ignal to bear away two points from the wind, and en|gage. At this time his di&s;tance from the enemy was &s;o great, that rear-admiral We&s;t, perceiving it impo&s;&s;ible to comply with both orders, bore away with his divi&s;ion &s;even points from the wind, and, clo&s;ing down upon the enemy, attacked them with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, that the &s;hips which oppo&s;ed him were in a little time driven out of the line. Had he been properly &s;u&s;tained by the van, in all probability the Briti&s;h fleet would have obtained a complete victory: but the other divi&s;ion did not bear down, and the enemy's centre keeping their
<PB N="320" REF="3320">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> &s;tation, rear-admiral We&s;t could not pur&s;ue his advantage without running the ri&s;que of &s;eeing his communication with the re&s;t of the line intirely cut off.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the action the Intrepid, in Mr. Byng's divi&s;ion, was &s;o di&s;abled in her rigging, that &s;he could not be managed, and drove on the &s;hip that was next in po&s;ition: a circum&s;tance which obliged &s;everal others to throw all a&punc;back, in order to avoid confu&s;ion, and for &s;ome time re|tarded the action. Certain it is, that Mr. Byng, though accommodated with a noble &s;hip of ninety guns, made little or no u&s;e of his artillery; but kept aloof, either from an over&s;trained ob&s;ervance of di&s;cipline, or timidity. When his captain ex|horted him to bear down upon the enemy, he very coolly replied, that he would avoid the error of admiral Matthews, who, in his engagement with the French and Spani&s;h &s;quadrons off Toulon, during the preceding war, had broke the line by his own precipitation, and expo&s;ed him&s;elf &s;ingly to a fire that he could not &s;u&s;tain. Mr. Byng, on the contrary, was determined again&s;t acting, except with the line intire; and, on pretence of rectifying the di&s;order which had happened among &s;ome of the &s;hips, he&s;itated &s;o long, and kept at &s;uch a wary di&s;tance, that he never was properly engaged, though he received &s;ome few &s;hots in his hull. Mr. de la Gali&s;&s;ionere &s;eemed equally aver&s;e to the continuance of the battle: part of his &s;quadron had been fairly obliged to quit the line; and tho' he was rather &s;uperior to the Engli&s;h in number of men and weight of metal, he did not chu&s;e to abide the con&s;equence of a clo&s;er fight with an enemy,
<PB N="321" REF="3330">
&s;o expert in naval operations: he therefore took<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> advantage of Mr. Byng's he&s;itation, and edged away with an ea&s;y &s;ail to join his van, which had been di&s;comfited. The Engli&s;h admiral gave chace; but the French &s;hips being clean, he could not come up and clo&s;e them again, &s;o they retired at their lei&s;ure. Then he put his &s;quadron on the other tack, in order to keep the wind of the enemy; and next morning they were altogether out of &s;ight.</P>
<P>While, with the re&s;t of his fleet, he lay to, at the di&s;tance of ten leagues from Mahon, he de|tached crui&s;ers to look for &s;ome mi&s;&s;ing &s;hips, which joined him accordingly, and made an inqui|ry into the condition of the &s;quadron. The num|ber of killed amounted to forty two, including captain Andrews of the Defiance, and about one hundred and &s;ixty&punc;eight were wounded. Three of the capital &s;hips were &s;o damaged in their ma&s;ts, that they could not keep the &s;ea, with any regard to their &s;afety: a great number of the &s;eamen were ill, and there was no ve&s;&s;el which could be con|verted into an ho&s;pital for the &s;ick and wounded. In this &s;ituation Mr. Byng called a council of war, at which the land officers were pre&s;ent. He re|pre&s;ented to them, that he was much inferior to the enemy in weight of metal and numbers of men; that they had the advantage of &s;ending their wounded to Minorca, from whence at the &s;ame time they were refre&s;hed and reinforced occa&s;ional|ly; that, in his opinion, it was impracticable to relieve St. Philip's fort, and therefore they ought to make the be&s;t of their way back to Gibraltar, which might require immediate protection. They
<PB N="322" REF="3340">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> unanimou&s;ly concurred with his &s;entiments, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. Byng returns to Gibraltar.</NOTE> thither he directed his cour&s;e accordingly. How he came to be &s;o well acquainted with the imprac|ticability of relieving general Blakeney, it is not ea&s;y to determine, ina&s;much as no experiment was made for that purpo&s;e. Indeed, the neglect of &s;uch a trial &s;eems to have been the lea&s;t excu&s;eable part of his conduct; for it afterwards appeared, that the officers and &s;oldiers belonging to the gar|ri&s;on might have heen landed at the &s;ally-port, without running any great ri&s;que; and a gentle|man, then in the fort, actually pa&s;&s;ed and repa&s;&s;ed in a boat, unhurt by any of the enemy's batteries.</P>
<P>Mr. Byng's letter to the admiralty, containing a detail of this action, is &s;aid to have arrived &s;ome days before it was made public; and when it ap|peared was curtailed of divers expre&s;&s;ions and whole paragraphs, which either tended to his own ju&s;tifi|cation, or implied a cen&s;ure on the conduct of his &s;uperiors. Whatever u&s;e might have been made of this letter while it remained a &s;ecret to the pub|lic, we &s;hall not pretend to explain: but &s;ure it is, that on the &s;ixteenth day of June, Sir Edward Hawke and admiral Saunders &s;ailed from Spithead to Gibraltar, to &s;uper&s;ede the admirals Byng and We&s;t, in their commands of the Mediterranean &s;quadron; and Mr. Byng's letter was not publi&s;hed till the twenty &s;ixth day of the &s;ame month, when it produced all the effect which that gentleman's<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ferment of the people at home.</NOTE> bittere&s;t enemies could have de&s;ired. The popu|lace took fire like a train of the mo&s;t ha&s;ty com|bu&s;tibles, and broke out in &s;uch a clamour of rage and indignation again&s;t the devoted admiral, as could not have been exceeded, if he had lo&s;t the
<PB N="323" REF="3350">
whole navy of England, and left the coa&s;ts of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> kingdom naked to inva&s;ion. This animo&s;ity was carefully fomented and maintained by artful emi&s;|&s;aries, who mingled with all public a&s;&s;emblies, from the drawing&punc;room at St. James's to the mob at Charing-cro&s;s. They expatiated upon the in&s;o|lence, the folly, the cowardice, and mi&s;conduct of the unhappy admiral. They even pre&s;umed to make their &s;overeign in &s;ome mea&s;ure an in&s;trument of their calumny&punc; by &s;ugge&s;ting that his maje&s;ty had progno&s;ticated Byng's mi&s;behaviour from the contents of his fir&s;t letter dated at Gibraltar. They ridiculed and refuted the rea&s;ons he had given for returning to that fortre&s;s, after his &s;candalous ren|counter with the French &s;quadron; and, in order to exa&s;perate them to the mo&s;t implacable re&s;entment, they exaggerated the terrible con&s;equences of lo&s;ing Minorca, which mu&s;t now be &s;ubdued through his treachery, or want of re&s;olution. In a word, he was devoted as the &s;cape goat of the m&mdash;y, to who&s;e &s;upine negligence, ignorance, and mi&s;con|duct the lo&s;s of that important fortre&s;s was un|doubtedly owing. Byng's mi&s;carriage was thrown out like a barrel to the whale, in order to engage the attention of the people, that it might not be attracted by the real cau&s;e of the national misfor|tune. In order to keep up the flame which had been kindled again&s;t the admiral, recour&s;e was had to the lowe&s;t artifices. Agents were employed to vilify his per&s;on in all public places of vulgar re|&s;ort; and mobs were hired at different parts of the capital to hang and burn him in effigie.</P>

By the &s;ame con|veyance<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ad|miral &s;u|per&s;eded, and &s;ent home a pri&s;oner.</NOTE> a letter from the &s;ecretary of the admiralty was tran&s;mitted to Mr. Byng, giving him notice that he was recalled. To this intimation he re|plied in &s;uch a manner as denoted a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having done his duty, and a laudable de&s;ire to vindicate his own conduct. His an&s;wer contained a further account of the engagement in which he was &s;uppo&s;ed to have mi&s;behaved, intermixed with &s;ome puerile calculations of the enemy's &s;uperiority in weight of metal, which &s;erved no other purpo&s;e than that of expo&s;ing his character &s;till more to ri|dicule and abu&s;e; and he was again &s;o impolitic as to hazard certain expre&s;&s;ions, which added fre&s;h fuel to the re&s;entment of his enemies. Directions were immediately di&s;patched to Sir Edward Hawke that Byng &s;hould be &s;ent home in arre&s;t: and an order to the &s;ame purpo&s;e was lodged at every port in the kingdom: precautions, which however unne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure the per&s;on of a man who longed ardently to ju&s;tify his character by a public trial, were yet productive of con&s;iderable effect in aug|menting the popular odium.</P>

The armament of Toulon, con&s;i&s;ting of the fleet commanded by Mr. de la Gali&s;&s;oniere, and the troops under the duke de Richelieu, arrived on the eighteenth day of April at the port of Ciudadella, on that part of the i&s;land oppo&s;ite to Mahon, or St. Philip's, and immediately began to di&s;embark their forces.</P>
<P>Two days before they reached the i&s;land, gene|ral Blakeney had by a packet-boat received cer|tain intelligence of their approach, and begun to make preparations for the defence of the ca&s;tle. The fort which he commanded was very exten&s;ive, &s;urrounded with numerous redoubts, ravelings, and other outworks; and provided with &s;ubterranean galleries, mines, and traver&s;es, cut out of the &s;olid rock with incredible labour. Upon the whole, this was one of the be&s;t fortified places in Europe, well &s;upplied with artillery, ammunition, and pro|vi&s;ion; and, without all doubt, might have &s;u&s;|tained the mo&s;t de&s;perate &s;iege, had it been de|fended by a numerous garri&s;on, conducted by able engineers, under the eye and au&s;pices of an active and &s;kilful commander. All the&s;e advantages, however, did not concur on this occa&s;ion. The number of troops in Minorca did not exceed four regiments, whereas the nature of the works re|quired at lea&s;t double the number; and, even of the&s;e, above forty officers were ab&s;ent. The chief
<PB N="326" REF="3390">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> engineer was rendered lame by the gout, and the general him&s;elf oppre&s;&s;ed with the infirmities of old age. The natives of the i&s;land might have been &s;erviceable as pioneers, or day labourers; but, from their hatred to the prote&s;tant religion, they were generally aver&s;e to the Engli&s;h govern|ment&punc; although they had lived happily and grown wealthy under its influence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Precauti|ons taken by gene|ral Brake|ney.</NOTE> The governor ordered his officers to beat up for volunteers in the adjacent town of St. Philip's; but few or none would inli&s;t under his banners, and it &s;eems $e would not venture to compel them into the &s;ervice. He recalled all his advanced parties; and, in particular, a company po&s;ted at Fornelles, where a &s;mall redoubt had been rai&s;ed, and five companies at Ciudadella, a po&s;t fortified with two pieces of cannon, which were now with|drawn as &s;oon as the enemy began to di&s;embark their forces. At the &s;ame time Major Cunning|ham was detached with a party to break down the bridges, and break up the roads, between that place and St Philip's; but the ta&s;k of de&s;troying the roads could not be performed in &s;uch a hurry, on account of the hard rock which runs along the &s;urface of the ground through this whole i&s;land; nor was there time to demoli&s;h the town of St. Philip's, which &s;tood &s;o near the fort, that the enemy could not fail to take advantage of its neighbourhood. The &s;treets &s;erved them for trenches, which otherwi&s;e could not have been dug through the &s;olid rock. Here they made a lodgment clo&s;e to the works; here they found convenient barra$ks and quarters of refre&s;hment, ma&s;ks for their batteries, and an effectual cover for
<PB N="327" REF="3400">
their mortars and bombardiers. The general has<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> been blamed for leaving the town &s;tanding; but if we con&s;ider his uncertainty concerning the de&s;ti|nation of the French armament, the odious nature of &s;uch a precaution, which could not fail to exa&s;|perate the inhabitants, and the impo&s;&s;ibility of executing &s;uch a &s;cheme after the fir&s;t appearance of the enemy, he will be found excu&s;eable, if not altogether blamele&s;s. Some hou&s;es and windmills were actually demoli&s;hed, &s;o as to clear the e&s;pla|nade and the approaches. All the wine in the cel|lars of St. Philip's town was de&s;troyed, and the butts were carried into the ca&s;tle, where they might &s;erve for gabions and traver&s;es. Five and twenty Minorquin bakers were hired, and a large number of cattle brought into the fort, for the benefit of the garri&s;on. The ports were walled up, the po&s;ts a&s;&s;igned, the centinels placed, and all the different guards appointed. Commodore Edgecumbe, who then anchored in the harbour of Mahon, clo&s;e un|der the walls of the ca&s;tle, &s;ailed away with his little &s;quadron, con&s;i&s;ting of the Che&s;terfield, Prin|ce&s;s Loui&s;a, Portland, and Dolphin, after having left all his marines, a detachment from Gibraltar, the whole crew of the Porcupine &s;loop, and the greater part of the Dolphin's, as a reinforcement to the fort, under the immediate direction and command of captain Scroop of the Dolphin, who with great gallantry, offered him&s;elf for this &s;evere duty, and bravely &s;ignalized him&s;elf during the whole &s;iege.</P>
<P>The French admiral might have certainly blocked up this harbour in &s;uch a manner as would have prevented the e&s;cape of the&s;e &s;hips, and divers
<PB N="328" REF="3410">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> other rich merchant-ve&s;&s;els, which happened then to be at Mahon; but, in all probability, they pur|po&s;ely allowed them to abandon the place, which, on any emergency, or a&s;&s;ault, their crews and offi|cers would have con&s;iderably reinforced.</P>
<P>The enemy were perfectly acquainted with the great extent of the works, and the weakne&s;s of the garri&s;on; from which circum&s;tances they derived the mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes that the place might be &s;uddenly taken, without the trouble of a regular &s;iege.</P>
<P>After Mr. Edgecumbe had &s;ailed for Gibraltar, and general Blakeney had ordered a &s;loop to be &s;unk in the channel that leads to the harbour, the French &s;quadron made its appearance at this part of the i&s;land; but, without having attempted any thing again&s;t the fort, fell to leeward of Cape Mola. Next day they came in &s;ight again; but &s;oon bore away, and never afterwards, during the whole cour&s;e of the &s;iege, approached &s;o near as to give the garri&s;on the lea&s;t di&s;turbance.</P>
<P>On the twenty &s;econd day of April the governor &s;ent a d ummer to the French general with a let|ter, de&s;iring to know his rea&s;ons for invading the i&s;land. To this an an&s;wer was returned by the duke de Richelieu, declaring he was come with in|tent on to reduce the i&s;land under the dominion of his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian maje&s;ty, by way of retaliation for the conduct of his ma&s;ter, who had &s;eized and detained the &s;hips belonging to the king of France and his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>If we may judge from the fir&s;t operations of this nobleman, he was but indifferently provided with engineers: for, in&s;tead of beginning his ap|proaches

on the &s;ide of St. Philip's town, clo&s;e by<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> the outworks, where he might have been &s;creened<NOTE PLACE="marg">Com|mence|ment of the &s;iege.</NOTE> from the fire of the garri&s;on, his batteries were erected at Cape Mola, on the other &s;ide of the har|bour, where they were more expo&s;ed, their fire much le&s;s effectual, and indeed at too great a di&s;|tance to be of any &s;ervice. The fire of St. Philip's was &s;o &s;evere, and the cannon &s;o well &s;erved on this quarter, that in a little time the enemy thought proper to change their plan of attack, and advance on the &s;ide of St. Philip's town, which ought to have been the fir&s;t object of their con&s;ideration, e&s;pecially as they could find little or no earth to fill their gabions, and open their trenches in the u&s;ual form.</P>
<P>On the twelfth of May, about nine at night, they opened two bomb batteries, near the place where the wind-mills had been de&s;troyed; and from that period an ince&s;&s;ant fire was kept up, on both &s;ides, from mortars and cannon, the French continuing to rai&s;e new batteries in every &s;ituation from whence they could annoy the be&s;ieged.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Eng|li&s;h &s;qua|dron ap|pears.</NOTE> On the &s;eventeenth day of the month the garri|&s;on were tran&s;ported with joy at &s;ight of the Bri|ti&s;h &s;quadron, commanded by admiral Byng; and Mr. Boyd, commi&s;&s;ary of the &s;tores, ventured to embark in a &s;mall boat with &s;ix oars, which pa&s;&s;ed from St. Stephen's cove, a creek on the we&s;t &s;ide of the fortification, through a &s;hower of cannon and mu&s;quetry from the enemy's po&s;t on the other &s;ide, and actually reached the open &s;ea, his de&s;ign being to join the &s;quadron; but this being at a great di&s;tance, &s;tretching away to the &s;outhward, and Mr. Boyd perceiving him&s;elf chaced by two
<PB N="330" REF="3430">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> of the enemy's light ve&s;&s;els, he returned by the &s;ame route to the garri&s;on, without having &s;u&s;tain|ed the lea&s;t damage. A circum&s;tance which plainly confutes the notion of Mr. Byng, that it was impracticable to open a communication with the garri&s;on of St. Philip's.</P>
<P>Next day the hopes of the be&s;ieged, which had progno&s;ticated a naval victory to the Briti&s;h &s;qua|dron, a &s;peedy relief to them&s;elves, and no le&s;s than captivity to the a&s;&s;ailants, were con&s;iderably damped by the appearance of the French fleet, which quietly returned to their &s;tation off the har|bour of Mahon. That &s;ame evening they were told by a de&s;erter, that the Engli&s;h fleet had been wor&s;ted in an engagement by Mr. de la Gali&s;&s;o|niere; and this information was &s;oon confirmed by a general di&s;charge, or Feu de joie, through the whole French camp, to celebrate the victory they pretended to have obtained.</P>
<P>How little &s;oever they had rea&s;on to boa&s;t of any advantage in the action, the retreat of the Eng|li&s;h &s;quadron was undoubtedly equivalent to a vic|tory: for had Mr. Byng acquired and maintained the &s;uperiority at &s;ea, the French forces, which had been di&s;embarked in Minorca, would, in all proba|bility, have been obliged to &s;urrender pri&s;oners of war to his Britannic maje&s;ty. The ca&s;e was now much altered in their favour: their &s;quadron crui&s;ed about the i&s;land without mole&s;tation: and they daily received&punc; by means of their tran&s;ports, reinforcements of men and ammunition, as well as con&s;tant &s;upplies of provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h garri&s;on, however mortified at finding them&s;elves thus abandoned, re&s;olved to ac|quit
<PB N="331" REF="3440">
them&s;elves with gallantry in the defence of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> place, not without &s;ome remaining hope that the Engli&s;h &s;quadron would be reinforced, and return to their relief.</P>
<P>In the mean time, they &s;u&s;tained and retorted the enemy's fire with undaunted re&s;olution. They remounted cannon, the carriages of which had been di&s;abled: they removed them occa&s;ionally to places from whence it was judged they could do the greate&s;t execution: they repaired breaches, re&s;tored merlons, and laboured with &s;urpri&s;ing alacrity, even when they were &s;urrounded by the numerous batteries of the foe; when their em|bra&s;ures, and even the parapets, were demoli&s;hed, and they &s;tood expo&s;ed not only to the cannon and mortars, but al&s;o to the mu&s;quetry, which fired upon them, without cea&s;ing, from the windows of the hou&s;es in the town of St. Philip. By this time they were inve&s;ted with an army of twenty thou|&s;and men, and plyed ince&s;&s;antly from &s;ixty-two battering-cannon, twenty-one mortars, and four howitzers, be&s;ides the &s;mall arms: neverthele&s;s, the lo&s;s of men within the fortre&s;s was very incon|&s;iderable, the garri&s;on being mo&s;tly &s;ecured in the &s;ubterranean works, which were impenetrable to &s;hells or &s;hot. By the twenty-&s;eventh day of June<NOTE PLACE="marg">General attack of the works.</NOTE> they had made a practicable breach in one of the ravelins, and damaged the other outworks to &s;uch a degree, that they determined this night to give a general a&s;&s;ault. Accordingly, between the hours of ten and eleven, they advanced to the attack from all quarters on the land-&s;ide. At the &s;ame time a &s;trong detachment, in armed boats, at|tempted to force the harbour, and penetrate into
<PB N="332" REF="3450">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> the creek, called St. Stephen's cove, to &s;torm Fort Charles, and &s;econd the attack upon Fort Marlbo|rough on the farther &s;ide of the creek, the mo&s;t detached of all the outworks. The enemy ad|vanced with great intrepidity, and their com|mander, the duke de Richelieu, is &s;aid to have led them up to the works in per&s;on.</P>
<P>Such an a&s;&s;ault could not but be attended with great &s;laughter: they were mowed down, as they approached, with grape-&s;hot and mu&s;quetry; and &s;everal mines were &s;prung with great effect, &s;o that the glacis was almo&s;t covered with the dying and the dead. Neverthele&s;s, they per&s;evered with un|common re&s;olution; and, though repul&s;ed on every other &s;ide, at length made a lodgement in the Queen's redoubt, which had been greatly damaged by their cannon. Whether their &s;ucce&s;s in this quarter was owing to the weakne&s;s of the place, or to the timidity of the defenders, certain it is, the enemy were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion before it was known to the officers of the garri&s;on: for lieutenant-colonel Jeffries, the &s;econd in command, who had acquit|ted him&s;elf &s;ince the beginning of the &s;iege with equal courage, &s;kill, and activity, in his vi&s;itation of this po&s;t, was &s;uddenly &s;urrounded and taken by a file of French grenadiers, at a time when he never dreamed they had made a lodgement. Ma|jor Cunningham, who accompanied him, met with a &s;everer fate, though he e&s;caped captivity: he was run through the right arm with a bayonet, and the piece being di&s;charged at the &s;ame time, &s;hattered the bones of his hand in &s;uch a manner, that he was maimed for life. In this &s;hocking condition he retired behind a traver&s;e, and was carried home
<PB N="333" REF="3460">
to his quarters. Thus the governor was deprived<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> of his two principal a&s;&s;i&s;tants, one being taken, and the other di&s;abled.</P>
<P>The enemy having made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of An&s;truther's and the Queen's redoubts, from which perhaps they might have been di&s;lodged, had a vigorous effort been made for that purpo&s;e, before they had lei&s;ure to &s;ecure them&s;elves, the duke de Richelieu ordered a parley to be beat, in order to obtain permi&s;&s;ion to bury the dead, and remove the wounded. This reque&s;t was granted with more humanity than di&s;cretion, ina&s;much as the enemy took this opportunity to throw a reinforcement of men privately into the places where the lodgements had been made, and the&s;e penetrated into the gal|lery of the mines, which communicated with all the other outworks.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The gar|ri&s;on ca|pitulates.</NOTE> During this &s;hort ce&s;&s;ation, general Blakeney &s;ummoned a council of war, to deliberate upon the &s;tate of the fort and garri&s;on; and the majority de|clared for a capitulation. The works were in many places ruined; the body of the ca&s;tle was &s;hattered; many guns were di&s;mounted, the embra&s;ures and parapets demoli&s;hed, the pali&s;adoes broke in pieces, the garri&s;on exhau&s;ted with hard duty and ince&s;&s;ant watching, and the enemy in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;ub|terranean communications. Be&s;ides, the governor had received information from pri&s;oners, that the duke de Richelieu was alarmed by a report that the mar&s;hal duke de Bellei&s;le would be &s;ent to &s;u|per&s;ede him in the command, and for that rea&s;on would hazard another de&s;perate a&s;&s;ault, which it was the opinion of the majority the garri&s;on could not &s;u&s;tain. The&s;e con&s;iderations, added to the
<PB N="334" REF="3470">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> de&s;pair of being relieved, induced him to demand a capitulation. But this mea&s;ure was not taken with the unanimous con&s;ent of the council. Some of|ficers ob&s;erved, that the garri&s;on was very little di|mini&s;hed, and &s;till in good &s;pirits: that no breach was made in the body of the ca&s;tle, nor a &s;ingle cannon erected to batter in breach: that the lo&s;s of an outwork was never deemed a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for &s;urrendering &s;uch a fortre&s;s: that the counter|&s;carp was not yet taken, nor, on account of the rocky &s;oil, could be taken, except by a&s;&s;ault, which would co&s;t the enemy a greater number than they had lo&s;t in their late attempt: that they could not attack the ditch, or batter in breach, before the counter&s;carp &s;hould be taken, and even then they mu&s;t have recour&s;e to galleries before they could pa&s;s the fo&s;&s;e, which was furni&s;hed with mines and countermines: finally, they &s;ugge&s;ted that in all probability the Briti&s;h &s;quadron would be reinforced, and &s;ail back to their relief; or if it &s;hould not re|turn, it was the duty of the governor to defend the place to extremity, without having any regard to the con&s;equences. The&s;e remarks being over ruled, the chamade was beat, a conference en&s;ued, and very honourable conditions were granted to the garri&s;on, in con&s;ideration of the gallant defence they had made. This it mu&s;t be owned was vigo|rous while it la&s;ted, as the French general was &s;aid to have lo&s;t five thou&s;and men in the &s;iege; whereas the lo&s;s of the garri&s;on, which at fir&s;t fell &s;hort of three thou&s;and men, did not exceed one hundred. The capitulation imported that the garri&s;on &s;hould march out with all the honours of war, and be con|veyed by &s;ea to Gibraltar. The French were put
<PB N="335" REF="3480">
in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one gate, as well as Fort Charles<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> and Marlborough redoubt: but the Engli&s;h troops remained in the other works till the &s;eventh day of July, when they embarked. In the mean time reciprocal civilities pa&s;&s;ed between the commanders and officers of both nations.</P>
<P>The articles of capitulation were no &s;ooner ex|ecuted than mon&s;ieur de la Gali&s;&s;oniere &s;ailed back to Toulon, with all the prizes which had lain at anchor in the harbour of Mahon &s;ince the fort of St. Philip was fir&s;t inve&s;ted. In all probability the &s;afety of him&s;elf and his whole &s;quadron was owing to this expeditious retreat; for in a few days after the &s;urrender of the fort, Sir Edward Hawke's fleet, augmented by five &s;hips of the line, which had<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Edw&punc; Hawke &s;ails to Minorca.</NOTE> been &s;ent from England, when the fir&s;t tidings ar|rived of Minorca's being invaded, now made its appearance off the i&s;land: but by this time Gali&s;|&s;oniere was retired, and the Engli&s;h admiral had the mortification to &s;ee the French colours flying upon St. Philip's Ca&s;tle. What perhaps chagrined this gallant officer &s;till more, he was not provided with frigates, &s;loops, and &s;mall craft to crui&s;e around the i&s;land, and intercept the &s;upplies which were daily &s;ent to the enemy. Had he reached Minorca &s;ooner he might have di&s;comfited the French &s;quadron; but he could not have rai&s;ed the &s;iege of St. Philip's, becau&s;e the duke de Richelieu had received his rein|forcements, and &s;uch a train of artillery as no forti|fication could long with&s;tand. Indeed, if the gar|ri&s;on had been con&s;iderably reinforced, and the communication with it opened by &s;ea, the defence would have been protracted, and &s;o many vigorous &s;allies might have been made, that the a&s;&s;ailants
<PB N="336" REF="3490">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> would have had cau&s;e to repent of their enter|prize.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rejoic|ings in France, and cla|mour in England.</NOTE> When the news of this conque&s;t was brought to Ver&s;ailles, by the count of Egmont, whom the duke de Richelieu had di&s;patched for that purpo&s;e, the people of France were tran&s;ported with the mo&s;t extravagant joy. Nothing was &s;een but tri|umphs and proce&s;&s;ions; nothing heard but an|thems, congratulations, and hyperbolical enco|miums upon the conqueror of Minorca, who was celebrated in a thou&s;and poems, and &s;tudied ora|tions; while the conduct of the Engli&s;h was vili|fied and ridiculed in ballads, farces, and pa&s;qui|nades. Nothing more argues the degeneracy of a warlike nation than the pride of &s;uch mean triumph for an advantage which, in more vigorous times, would &s;carce have been di&s;tingui&s;hed by the ceremo|ny of a Te Deum Laudamus. Nor is this childi&s;h exultation, that di&s;graces the laurels of victory, confined to the kingdom of France. Truth obliges us to own, that even the &s;ubjects of Great Britain are apt to be elevated by &s;ucce&s;s into an illiberal in&s;olence of &s;elf-applau&s;e, and contemptuous com|pari&s;on. This mu&s;t be condemned as a proof of unmanly arrogance, and ab&s;urd &s;elf&punc;conceit, by all tho&s;e who coolly reflect, that the events of war ge|nerally, if not always, depend upon the genius or mi&s;conduct of one individual.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of Minorca was &s;everely felt in Eng|land, as a national di&s;grace; but, in&s;tead of pro|ducing dejection and de&s;pondence, it excited an univer&s;al clamour of rage and re&s;entment, not only again&s;t Mr. Byng, who had retreated from the French &s;quadron; but al&s;o in reproach of the ad|mini&s;tration,
<PB N="337" REF="3500">
which was taxed with having ne|glected<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> the &s;ecurity of Minorca. Nay, &s;ome po|liticians were inflamed into a &s;u&s;picion, that this important place had been negatively betrayed into the hands of the enemy, that, in ca&s;e the arms of Great Britain &s;hould pro&s;per in other parts of the world, the French king might have &s;ome &s;ort of equivalent to re&s;tore for the conque&s;ts which &s;hould be abandoned at the peace. This notion, how|ever, &s;eems to have been conceived from preju|dice and party, which now began to appear with the mo&s;t acrimonious a&s;pect, not only throughout the united kingdoms in general, but even in the &s;&mdash;n's councils.</P>
<P>Sir Edward Hawke, being di&s;appointed in his hope of encountering la Gali&s;&s;oniere, and relieving the Engli&s;h garri&s;on of St. Philip's, at lea&s;t a&s;&s;erted the empire of Great Britain in the Mediterra$ean, by annoying the commerce of the enemy, and blocking up their &s;quadron in the harbour of Tou|lon. Under&s;tanding that the Au&s;trian govern|ment at Leghorn had detained an Engli&s;h priva|teer, and impri&s;oned the captain, on pretence that he had violated the neutrality of the port, he de|tached two &s;hips of war to in&s;i&s;t, in a peremptory manner, on the relea&s;e of the &s;hip, effects, crew, and captain; and they thought proper to comply with his demand, even without waiting for orders from the court of Vienna. The per&s;on in who&s;e behalf the admiral thus interpo&s;ed, was one Fortu|natus Wright, a native of Liverpool; who, though a &s;tranger to a &s;ea-life, had, in the la&s;t war, equip|ped a privateer, and di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in &s;uch a manner, by his uncommon vigilance and valour,
<PB N="338" REF="3510">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> that, if he had been indulged with a command<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gallantry of For|tunatus Wright.</NOTE> &s;uitable to his genius, he would have de&s;erved as honourable a place in the annals of the navy, as that which the French have be&s;towed upon their boa&s;ted Gue Trouin, Du Bart, and Thurot. An uncommon exertion of &s;pirit was the occa&s;ion of his being detained at this juncture. While he lay at anchor in the harbour of Leghorn, commander of the St. George privateer of Liverpool, a &s;mall &s;hip of twelve guns and eighty men, a large French xebeque, mounted with &s;ixteen cannon, and nearly three times the number of his complement, cho&s;e her &s;tation in view of the harbour, in order to inter|rupt the Briti&s;h commerce.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I wrote to you by general Stewart: if that order is not complied with, then you are now to make a detachment of 700 men out of your own re|giment and Gui&s;e's; and al&s;o another detachment out of Pulteney's and Panmure's re|giments, and &s;end them on board the $leet for the relief of Mahon. But if that order has been complied with, then you are to make only one de|tachment of 700 men, to be commanded by another lieu|t$nant colonel and major, and to &s;end it to Mahon; and you are al&s;o to detain all &s;uch emp|ty ve&s;&s;els as &s;hall come into your harbour, and keep them in readine&s;s for any farther tran&s;portation of troops. I have al&s;o his royal highne&s;s the duke of Cumberland's commands to de&s;ire, that you will keep your garri&s;on as alert as po&s;&s;ible&punc; during this critical time, and give &s;uch other a&s;&s;i&s;tance as may be in your power for the relief of Minorca; taking care, however, not to fatigue or en|danger your own garri&s;on.</P>

Mr. F&mdash;ke alledged in his own defence, that the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> orders were confu&s;ed and contradictory, and im|plied a di&s;cretionary power: that the whole number of his garri&s;on did not exceed two thou&s;and &s;ix hun|dred men, after he had &s;pared two hundred and &s;eventy-five to the &s;hips commanded by Mr. Edg|cumbe: that the ordinary duty of the garri&s;on re|quiring eight hundred men, the whole number was not &s;ufficient for three reliefs: that, if he had detach|ed a battalion on board the fleet, he &s;hould not have had above two reliefs, at a time when he believed the place was in danger of being attacked, for good rea&s;ons which he did not think him&s;elf at liberty to
<PB N="352" REF="3650">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> mention: that his orders being doubtful, he held a council of war, which was of opinion, that as undoubted intelligence was received of the French army's being landed in Minorca to the number of between thirteen and &s;ixteen thou&s;and men, and that a French &s;quadron of &s;ixteen &s;hips were &s;tation|ed off the harbour, the &s;ending a detachment equal to a battalion from Gibraltar would be an ineffectual &s;upply for the relief of the place, and a weakening of the garri&s;on from which they mu&s;t be &s;ent. He ob&s;erved that &s;uppo&s;ing the orders to have been po|&s;itive, and &s;even hundred men detached to Minorca, the number remaining at Gibraltar would not have exceeded one thou&s;and five hundred and fifty-&s;ix; a deduction of &s;even hundred more, according to the order of May the twelfth, would have left a remainder of eight hundred and fifty-&s;ix: that the men daily on duty in the garri&s;on, including ar|tificers and labourers in the king's works, amount|ed to eight hundred and thirty-nine; &s;o that if he had complied with the orders as they arrived, he would not have had more than &s;eventeen men over and above the number nece&s;&s;ary for the daily work of the garri&s;on: thus the important fortre&s;s of Gibraltar mu&s;t, at this critical conjuncture, have been left almo&s;t naked and defencele&s;s to the at|tempts of the enemy; and had tho&s;e detachments been actually &s;ent aboard, it afterwards appeared that they could not have been landed on the i&s;land of Minorca. The order tran&s;mitted to general F&mdash;ke to detain all empty ve&s;&s;els, for a farther tran&s;portation of troops, &s;eems to have been &s;uper|fluous; for it can hardly be &s;uppo&s;ed he could have occa&s;ion for them, unle&s;s to embark the whole

garri&s;on, and abandon the place. It &s;eems likewi&s;e<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> to have been unnece&s;&s;ary to exhort the general to keep his garri&s;on as alert as po&s;&s;ible, during that critical time; ina&s;much as it would have been im|po&s;&s;ible for the men to have enjoyed the lea&s;t re|po&s;e or intermi&s;&s;ion of duty, had the orders been punctually and literally obeyed. What other a&s;|&s;i&s;tance it might have been in the governor's power to give for the relief of Minorca, or in what manner he could avoid fatiguing his garri&s;on, while there was an impo&s;&s;ibility of relieving the guards, it is not ea&s;y to comprehend. Be that as it may, when the trial was fini&s;hed, and the que&s;tion put to ac|quit or &s;u&s;pend for one year, the court was equally divided; and in &s;uch ca&s;es the ca&s;ting vote being ve&s;ted in the pre&s;ident, he threw it into the &s;cale again&s;t the pri&s;oner, whom his maje&s;ty thought fit to di&s;mi&s;s from his &s;ervice.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of America.</NOTE> The expectation of the public was now eagerly turned towards America, the chief if not the &s;ole &s;cene of our military operations. On the twenty-fifth day of June, Mr. Abercrombie arrived at Al|bany, the frontier of New York, and a&s;&s;umed the command of the forces there a&s;&s;embled, con&s;i&s;ting of two regiments which had &s;erved under Brad|dock, two battalions rai&s;ed in America, two regi|ments now tran&s;ported from England, four inde|pendent companies which had been many years maintained in New York, the New Jer&s;ey regiment, four companies levied in North Carolina, and a body of provincial forces rai&s;ed by the government of New England. Tho&s;e to the &s;outhward, includ|ing Pen&s;ylvania, Maryland, and Virginia, had not yet determined on any regular plan of operation,
<PB N="354" REF="3670">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> and were moreover hard pre&s;&s;ed in defending their we&s;tern frontier from the French and Indians, who, in &s;culking parties, made &s;udden irruptions upon their unguarded &s;ettlements, burning, plundering, and ma&s;&s;acring with the mo&s;t &s;avage inhumanity. As for South Carolina, the proportion of Negro|&s;laves to the number of white inhabitants, was &s;o great in that colony, that the government could not, with any regard to the &s;afety of the province, &s;pare any reinforcement for the general enterprize. The plan of this undertaking had been &s;ettled the pre|ceding year in a council of war held at New York. Here it was re&s;olved to attack the fort of Niagara, &s;ituated between the lakes Ontario and Erie, in order to cut off the communication between Ca|nada and Loui&s;iana, and prevent the French from &s;upporting their new fortre&s;&s;es on the Ohio; to reduce Ticonderago and Crown-Point, &s;o that the frontier of New York might be delivered from the danger of an inva&s;ion, and Great Britain become ma&s;ter of the lake Champlain, over which the forces might be tran&s;ported in any future attempt; to be&s;iege Fort Du Que&s;ne upon the Ohio; and to detach a body of troops, by the river Kennebec, to alarm the capital of Canada. This plan was too exten&s;ive for the number of troops which had been prepared: the &s;ea&s;on was too far advanced before the regiments arrived from England, the different colonies were divided in their opinions, and Mr. Abercrombie po&s;tponed the execution of any im|portant &s;cheme till the arrival of lord Loudon, who was daily expected. The rea&s;ons that delayed the reinforcement, and detained his lord&s;hip &s;o long, we do not pretend to explain; though we may be
<PB N="355" REF="3680">
allowed to ob&s;erve, that many fair opportunities<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> have been lo&s;t by the neglect and procra&s;tination of an Engli&s;h mini&s;try. Certain it is, the unac|countable delay of this armament rendered it u&s;e|le&s;s for a whole year, afforded time and lei&s;ure to the enemy to take their precautions again&s;t any &s;ub&s;equent attack, and, in the mean time, to pro|ceed unmole&s;ted in di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the Briti&s;h &s;ettle|ments.</P>
<P>Even before this period, they had attacked and reduced a &s;mall po&s;t in the country of the Five Na|tions, occupied by twenty-five Engli&s;hmen, who were cruelly butchered to a man, in the mid&s;t of tho&s;e Indians whom Great Britain had long num|bered among her allies.</P>
<P>Soon after this expedition, having received intel|ligence that a con&s;iderable convoy of provi&s;ions and &s;tores, for the garri&s;on at O&s;wego, would in a little time &s;et out from Schenectady, and be con|veyed in battoes up the river Onondaga, they formed an ambu&s;cade among the woods and thickets on the north &s;ide of that river; but, un|der&s;tanding the convoy had pa&s;&s;ed before they reached the place, they re&s;olved to wait the return of the detachment. Their de&s;ign, however, was<NOTE PLACE="marg">A body of Frenchre|pul&s;ed by col. Brad|&s;treet on the river Ononda|ga.</NOTE> fru&s;trated by the vigilance and valour of colonel Brad&s;treet, who expected &s;uch an attempt, and had taken his mea&s;ures accordingly. On the third day of July, while he &s;temmed the &s;tream of the river, with his battoes formed into three divi&s;ions, they were &s;aluted with the Indian war-whoop, and a ge|neral di&s;charge of mu&s;quetry from the north-&s;hore. Brad&s;treet immediately ordered his men to land on the oppo&s;ite bank, and with a few of the foremo&s;t
<PB N="356" REF="3690">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;mall i&s;land, where he was forthwith attacked by a party of the enemy, who had forded the river for that purpo&s;e; but the&s;e were &s;oon repul&s;ed. Another body having pa&s;&s;ed a mile higher, he advanced to them at the head of two hundred men, and fell upon them, &s;word in hand, with &s;uch vigour, that many were killed on the &s;pot, and the re&s;t driven into the river with &s;uch precipitation, that a con&s;iderable number of them was drowned. Having received informa|tion that a third body of them had pa&s;&s;ed at a ford &s;till higher, he marched thither without he&s;itation, and pur&s;ued them to the other &s;ide, where they were entirely routed and di&s;per&s;ed. In this action, which la&s;ted near three hours, about &s;eventy of the battoe-men were killed or wounded: but the ene|my lo&s;t double the number killed, and above &s;e|venty taken pri&s;oners. In all probability the whole detachment of French, amounting to &s;even hundred men, would have been cut off, had not a heavy rain interpo&s;ed, and di&s;abled colonel Brad&s;treet from following his blow; for that &s;ame night he was joined by captain Patten, with his grenadiers, in his march from Oneida to O&s;wego, and next morn|ing reinforced with two hundred men, detached to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the garri&s;on of O&s;wego: but by this time the rivulets were &s;o &s;welled by the rain, that it was found impracticable to pur&s;ue the enemy through the woods and thickets.</P>
<P>Patten and his grenadiers accompanied the de|tachment to O&s;wego, while Brad&s;treet pur&s;ued his voyage to Schenectady; from whence he repaired to Albany, and communicated to general Aber|crombie the intelligence he had received from the

pri&s;oners, importing, that a large body of the ene|my<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> were encamped on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the lake Ontario, provided with artillery, and all other im|plements, to be&s;iege the fort of O&s;wego.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this information, major-gene|ral Webb was ordered to hold him&s;elf in readine&s;s to march with one regiment to the relief of that garri&s;on; but, before they could be provided with nece&s;&s;aries, the earl of Loudon arrived at the head-quarters<NOTE PLACE="marg">The earl of Lou|don ar|rives at New York.</NOTE> at Albany, on the twenty-ninth day of July. The army at this time is &s;aid to have con|&s;i&s;ted of regular troops to the number of two thou|&s;and &s;ix hundred, about &s;even thou&s;and provin|cials, &s;uppo&s;ed to be in readine&s;s to march from Fort William Henry, under the command of gene|ral Win&s;low, over and above a con&s;iderable num|ber of battoe-men at Albany and Schenectady. The garri&s;on at O&s;wego amounted to fourteen-hun|dred &s;oldiers, be&s;ides three hundred workmen and &s;ailors, either in the fort, or po&s;ted in &s;mall parties between the fort and a place called Burnet's field, to &s;ecure a &s;afe pa&s;&s;age through the country of the Six Nations, upon who&s;e friend&s;hip there was no lon|ger any reliance. By the be&s;t accounts received of the enemy's force, they had about three thou&s;and men at Crown Point and Ticonderago upon the lake Champlain: but their chief &s;trength was collected upon the banks of the lake Ontario, where their purpo&s;e undoubtedly was to reduce the Engli&s;h fort at O&s;wego. The immediate object, therefore, of lord Loudon's attention was the relief of this place: but his de&s;ign was &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed by the province of New York, and other northern governments, who were much more intent upon
<PB N="358" REF="3720">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> the reduction of Crown-Point, and the &s;ecurity of their own frontiers, which they apprehended was connected with this conque&s;t. They in&s;i&s;ted upon Win&s;low's being joined by &s;ome regiments of re|gular troops before he &s;hould march again&s;t this fortre&s;s; and &s;tipulated, that a body of re&s;erve &s;hould be detained at Albany, for the defence of that frontier, in ca&s;e Win&s;low &s;hould fail in his en|terprize, and be defeated. At length they agreed, that the regiment which Mr. Abercrombie had de&s;tined for that purpo&s;e, &s;hould be detached to the relief of O&s;wego; and on the twelfth day of Augu&s;t major-general Webb began his march with it from Albany: but on his arrival at the Carrying-place, between the Mohock's river and Wood's creek, he received the di&s;agreeable news that O&s;we|go was taken, and the garri&s;on made pri&s;oners of war. Mr. Webb, apprehending him&s;elf in danger of being attacked by the be&s;ieging army, began immediately to render the creek impa&s;&s;able, even to canoes, by felling trees, and throwing them into the &s;tream; while the enemy, ignorant of his numbers, and apprehen&s;ive of a like vi&s;itation from him, took the very &s;ame method of preventing his approach: in con&s;equence of this apprehen&s;ion, he was permitted to retire unmole&s;ted.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of the two &s;mall forts, called Ontario and O&s;wego, was a con&s;iderable national misfor|tune. They were erected on the &s;outh &s;ide of the great lake Ontario, &s;tanding on oppo&s;ite &s;ides, at the mouth of the Onondago river, that di&s;charges it&s;elf into the lake, and con&s;tituted a po&s;t of great importance, where ve&s;&s;els had been built, to crui&s;e upon the lake, which is a kind of inland &s;ea, and
<PB N="359" REF="3730">
interrupt the commerce as well as the motions and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> de&s;igns of the enemy. The garri&s;on, as we have already ob&s;erved, con&s;i&s;ted of fourteen hundred men, chiefly militia and new-rai&s;ed recruits, under the command of lieutenant-colonel Mercer, an of|ficer of courage and experience: but the &s;ituation of the forts was very ill cho&s;en; the materials mo&s;t|ly timber, or logs of wood; the defences wretch|edly contrived, and unfini&s;hed; and, in a word, the place altogether untenable again&s;t any regular approach. Such were the forts which the enemy wi&s;ely re&s;olved to reduce. Being under no appre|hen&s;ion for Crown-Point, they a&s;&s;embled a body of troops, con&s;i&s;ting of thirteen hundred regulars, &s;eventeen hundred Canadians, and a con&s;iderable number of Indian auxiliaries, under the command of the marquis de Montcalm, a vigilant and enter|pri&s;ing officer, to whom the conduct of the &s;iege was intru&s;ted by the marquis de Vaudrueil, gover|nor and lieutenant-general of New France. The fir&s;t &s;tep taken by Montcalm was to block up O&s;|wego by water with two large armed ve&s;&s;els, and po&s;t a &s;trong body of Canadians on the road be|tween Albany and the forts, to cut off all commu|nication of &s;uccour and intelligence. In the mean time, he embarked his artillery and &s;tores upon the lake, and landed them in the bay of Nixouri, the place of general rendezvous. At another creek, within half a league of O&s;wego, he erected a bat|tery for the protection of his ve&s;&s;els; and on the twelfth day of Augu&s;t, at midnight, after his di&s;|po&s;itions had been made, he opened the trenches before Fort Ontario. The garri&s;on, having fired away all their &s;hells and ammunition, &s;piked up the
<PB N="360" REF="3740">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> cannon, and, de&s;erting the fort, retired next day acro&s;s the river into O&s;wego, which was even more expo&s;ed than the other, e&s;pecially when the enemy had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Ontario, from whence they immediately began to fire without intermi&s;&s;ion. Colonel Mercer being, on the thirteenth, killed by a cannon-ball, the fort de&s;titute of all cover, the officers divided in opinion, and the garri&s;on in con|fu&s;ion, they next day demanded a capitulation, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">O&s;wego reduced by the enemy.</NOTE> &s;urrendered pri&s;oners of war, on condition, that they &s;hould be exempted from plunder, conducted to Montreal, and treated with humanity. The&s;e conditions, however, the marquis did not punc|tually ob&s;erve. The Briti&s;h officers and &s;oldiers were in&s;ulted by the &s;avage Indians, who robbed them of their cloaths and baggage, ma&s;&s;acred &s;everal men as they &s;tood defencele&s;s on the pa|rade, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated lieutenant De la Court as he lay wounded in his tent, under the protection of a French officer, and barbarou&s;ly &s;calped all the &s;ick people in the ho&s;pital: finally, Montcalm, in direct violation of the articles, as well as in contempt of common humanity, delivered up above twenty men of the garri&s;on to the Indians, in lieu of the &s;ame number they had lo&s;t during the &s;iege; and, in all probability, the&s;e mi&s;erable captives were put to death by tho&s;e barbarians with the mo&s;t excru|ciating tortures, according to the execrable cu&s;tom of the country.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who countenance the perpetration of cruel|ties, at which human nature &s;hudders with horror, ought to be branded as infamous to all po&s;terity Such, however, are the trophies that, in the cour&s;e of the American war, have di&s;tingui&s;hed the ope|rations

<P>The pri&s;oners taken at O&s;wego, after having been thus barbarou&s;ly treated, were conveyed in battoes to Montreal, where they had no rea&s;on to complain of their reception; and, before the end of the year, they were exchanged. The victors immediately demoli&s;hed the two forts (if they de|&s;erved that denomination), in which they found one hundred and twenty-one pieces of artillery, fourteen mortars, with a great quantity of ammu|nition, warlike &s;tores, and provi&s;ion, be&s;ides two &s;loops and two hundred battoes, which likewi&s;e fell into their hands. Such an important magazine, depo&s;ited in a place altogether indefen&s;ible, and without the reach of immediate &s;uccour, was a fla|grant proof of egregious folly, temerity, and mi&s;|conduct.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Further proceed|ings in America.</NOTE> The earl of Loudon, finding the &s;ea&s;on too far advanced to admit of any enterprize again&s;t the enemy, exerted all his endeavours in making pre|parations for an early campaign in the &s;pring, in &s;ecuring the frontiers of the Engli&s;h colonies, in forming an uniform plan of action, and promoting a &s;pirit of harmony among the different govern|ments, which had been long divided by jarring in|tere&s;ts, and other &s;ources of di&s;&s;ention.</P>
<P>Mean while, the forts Edward and William Henry were put in a proper po&s;ture of defence, and &s;ecured with numerous garri&s;ons; and the forces put into winter-quarters at Albany, where comfortable barracks were built for that pur|po&s;e.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> Fort Granville, on the confines of Pen&s;ylvania, an incon&s;iderable blockhou&s;e, was &s;urpri&s;ed by a party of French and Indians, who made the garri|&s;on pri&s;oners, con&s;i&s;ting of two and twenty &s;oldiers, with a few women and children. The&s;e they load|ed with flour and provi&s;ion, and drove into capti|vity; but the fort they reduced to a&s;hes.</P>
<P>Many &s;hocking murders were perpetrated upon defencele&s;s people, without di&s;tinction of age or &s;ex, in different parts of the frontiers: but the&s;e outrages were in &s;ome mea&s;ure ballanced by the advantages re&s;ulting from a treaty of peace, which the governor of Pen&s;ylvania concluded with the Delaware Indians, a powerful tribe that dwell upon the river Sa&s;quehanna, forming, as it were, a line along the &s;outhern &s;kirts of the province. At the &s;ame time the governor of Virginia &s;ecured the friend&s;hip and alliance of the Cherokees and Ca|tawbas, two powerful nations adjoining to that co|lony, who were able to bring three thou&s;and fight|ing men into the field.

Major Laurence, who now enjoyed the chief com|mand of the Engli&s;h forces, obtained divers ad|vantages over the enemy; and pro&s;ecuted his &s;uc|ce&s;s with &s;uch vigour, as, in all probability, would in a little time have terminated the war according to his own wi&s;h, when the progre&s;s of his arms was interrupted and &s;u&s;pended by an unfortunate event

The go|vernor, intimidated by the number and power of the enemy, abandoned the fort, and with &s;ome principal per&s;ons re&s;iding in the &s;ettlement, took refuge on board a &s;hip in the river, carrying along with them their mo&s;t valuable effects and the books of the company.

Then he was obliged to &s;ubmit; and the &s;uba, or viceroy, promi&s;ed, on the word of a &s;oldier, that no injury &s;hould be done to him or his garri&s;on.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, they were all driven, to the number of one hundred and forty &s;ix per&s;ons of both &s;exes, into a place called the black-hole pri&s;on, a cube of
<PB N="365" REF="3790">
about eighteen feet, walled up to the ea&s;tward and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> &s;outhward, the only quarters from which they could<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deplo|rable fate of tho&s;e who pe|ri&s;hed in the dun|geon.</NOTE> expect the lea&s;t refre&s;hing air, and open to the we&s;tward by two windows &s;trongly barred with iron, through which there was no perceptible cir|culation. The humane reader will conceive with horror the mi&s;erable &s;ituation to which they mu&s;t have been reduced, when thus &s;tewed up in a clo&s;e &s;ultry night under &s;uch a climate as that of Bengal, e&s;pecially when he reflects that many of them were wounded, and all of them fatigued with hard duty. Tran&s;ported with rage to find them&s;elves thus bar|barou&s;ly cooped up in a place where they mu&s;t be expo&s;ed to &s;uffocation, tho&s;e haple&s;s victims endea|voured to force open the door, that they might ru&s;h upon the &s;words of the barbarians by whom they were &s;urrounded: but all their efforts were ineffectual; the door was made to open inwards, and being once &s;hut upon them, the crowd pre&s;&s;ed upon it &s;o &s;trongly as to render all their endeavours abortive: then they were overwhelmed with di|&s;traction and de&s;pair. Mr. Holwell, who had placed him&s;elf at one of the windows, acco&s;ted a Jem|mautdaar, or &s;erjeant of the Indian guard, and having endeavoured to excite his compa&s;&s;ion, by drawing a pathetic picture of their &s;ufferings, pro|mi&s;ed to gratify him with a thou&s;and rupees in the morning if he could find means to remove one half of them into a &s;eparate apartment. The &s;oldier, allured by the promi&s;e of &s;uch a reward, a&s;&s;ured him he would do his endeavour for their relief, and retired for that purpo&s;e; but in a few minutes re|turned, and told him that the &s;uba, by who&s;e order alone &s;uch a &s;tep could be taken, was a&s;leep, and
<PB N="366" REF="3800">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> no per&s;on dur&s;t di&s;turb his repo&s;e. By this time a profu&s;e &s;weat had broke out on every individual, and this was attended with an in&s;atiable thir&s;t, which became the more intolerable as the body was drained of its moi&s;ture. In vain tho&s;e mi&s;e|rable objects &s;tripped them&s;elves of their cloaths, &s;quatted down on their hams, and fanned the air with their hats to produce a refre&s;hing undulation. Many were unable to ri&s;e again from this po&s;ture, but falling down were trod to death or &s;uff$cated. The dreadful &s;ymptom of thir&s;t was now accom|panied with a d$fficulty of re&s;piration, and every in|dividual ga&s;ped for breath. Their de&s;pair became outrageous: again they attempted to force the door, and provoke the guard to fire upon them by exe|cration and abu&s;e. The cry of "Water! Water!" i&s;&s;ued from every mouth. Even the Jemmautdaar was moved to compa&s;&s;ion at their di&s;tre&s;s. He or|dered his &s;oldiers to bring &s;ome &s;kins of water, which &s;erved only to enrage the appetite and in|crea&s;e the general agitation. There was no other way of conveying it through the windows but by hats, and this was rendered ineffectual by the eager|ne&s;s and tran&s;ports of the wretched pri&s;oners, who at &s;ight of it &s;truggled and raved even into fits of delirium. In con&s;equence of the&s;e conte&s;ts, very little reached tho&s;e that &s;tood neare&s;t the windows, while the re&s;t at the farther end of the pri&s;on were totally excluded from all relief, and continued calling upon their friends for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and con|juring them by all the tender&punc; ties of pity and af|fection. To tho&s;e who were indulged, it proved pernicious; for, in&s;tead of allaying their thir&s;t, it enraged their impatience for more. The confu|&s;ion
<PB N="367" REF="3810">
became general and horrid: all was clamour<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> and conte&s;t: tho&s;e who were at a di&s;tance endea|voured to force their pa&s;&s;age to the window, and the weak were pre&s;&s;ed down to the ground, never to ri&s;e again. The inhuman ruffians without, de|rived entertainment from their mi&s;ery: they &s;up|plied the pri&s;oners with more water, and held up lights clo&s;e to the bars, that they might enjoy the inhuman plea&s;ure of &s;eeing them fight for the bane|ful indulgence. Mr. Holwell, &s;eeing all his parti|cular friends lying dead around him, and trampled upon by the living, finding him&s;elf wedged up &s;o clo&s;e as to be deprived of all motion, begged, as the la&s;t in&s;tance of their regard, that they would remove the pre&s;&s;ure, and allow him to retire from the window, that he might die in quiet. Even in tho&s;e dreadful circum&s;tances, which might be &s;up|po&s;ed to have levelled all di&s;tinction, the poor deli|rious wretches manife&s;ted a re&s;pect for his rank and character. They forthwith gave way, and he forced his pa&s;&s;age into the center of the place, which was not crowded &s;o much; becau&s;e, by this time, about one third of the number had peri&s;hed, and lay in little compa&s;s on the floor, while the re&s;t &s;till crowded to both windows. He retired to a platform at the farther end of the room, and, lying down upon &s;ome of his dead friends, recommended his &s;oul to heaven. Here his thir&s;t grew in&s;up|portable: his difficulty in breathing increa&s;ed, and he was &s;eized with a &s;trong palpitation. The&s;e violent &s;ymptoms, which he could not bear, urged him to make another effort: he forced his way back to the window, and cried aloud, "Water! for God's &s;ake!" He had been &s;uppo&s;ed already
<PB N="368" REF="3820">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> dead by his wretched companions; but finding him &s;till alive, they exhibited another extraordinary proof of tenderne&s;s and regard to his per&s;on: "Give him water," they cried; nor would one of them attempt to touch it until he had drank. He now breathed more freely, and the palpitation cea&s;ed: but finding him&s;elf &s;till more thir&s;ty after drinking, he ab&s;tained from water, and moi&s;tened his mouth from time to time by &s;ucking the per|&s;piration from his &s;hirt-&s;leeves <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In his de&s;pair of obtain|ing water, this unhappy gen|tleman had attempted to drink his own urine; but found it intolerably bitter; whereas the moi&s;ture that flowed from the pores of his body was &s;oft, plea&s;ant, and refre&s;hing.</NOTE>. The mi&s;erable pri&s;oners, perceiving that water rather aggravated than relieved their di&s;tre&s;s, grew clamorous for air, and repeated their in&s;ults to the guard, loading the &s;uba and his governor with the mo&s;t virulent reproach. From railing, they had recour&s;e to prayer, be&s;eeching heaven to put an end to their mi&s;ery. They now began to drop on all hands; but then a &s;team aro&s;e from the living, and the dead, as pungent and volatile as &s;pirit of hart&s;|horn; &s;o that all who could not approach the win|dows were &s;uffocated. Mr. Holwell, being weary of life, retired once more to the platform, and &s;tretched him&s;elf by the reverend Mr. Jervas Bel|lamy, who, together with his &s;on, a lieutenant, lay dead in each other's embrace. In this &s;ituation he was &s;oon deprived of &s;en&s;e, and lay to all ap|pearance dead till day broke, when his body was di&s;covered, and removed by his &s;urviving friends to one of the windows, where the fre&s;h air revived him, and he was re&s;tored to his &s;ight and &s;en&s;es.

The &s;uba, at la&s;t, being informed that the greater<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> part of the pri&s;oners were &s;uffocated, inquired if the chief was alive; and being an&s;wered in the af|firmative, &s;ent an order for their immediate relea&s;e, when no more than twenty-three &s;urvived of an hundred and forty-&s;ix who had entered alive.</P>

He had received intimation, that there was a con&s;iderable trea&s;ure &s;ecreted in the fort, and that Mr. Holwell knew the place where it was depo|&s;ited. That gentleman, who, with his &s;urviving companions, had been &s;eized with a putrid fever, immediately upon their relea&s;e, was dragged in that condition before the inhuman &s;uba, who que&s;tioned him about the trea&s;ure, which exi&s;ted no where but in his own imagination; and would give no credit to his prote&s;tations, when he &s;olemnly de|clared he knew of no &s;uch depo&s;it. Mr. Holwell and three of his friends were loaded with fetters, and conveyed three miles to the Indian camp, where they lay all night, expo&s;ed to a &s;evere rain: next morning they were brought back to town, &s;till manacled, under the &s;corching beams of a &s;un inten&s;ely hot; and mu&s;t infallibly have expired, had not nature expelled the fever in large painful boils, that covered almo&s;t the whole body.

At Muxadabad they were led through the city in chains, as a &s;pectacle to the inhabitants, lodged in an open &s;table, and

At length the &s;uba's grandmother interpo&s;ed her mediation in their behalf; and as that prince was by this time convinced that there was no trea&s;ure concealed at Calcutta, he ordered them to be &s;et at liberty. When &s;ome of his &s;ycophants oppo&s;ed this indulgence, repre&s;enting that Mr. Holwell had &s;till enough left to pay a con&s;iderable ran&s;om, he replied with &s;ome marks of compunction and gene|ro&s;ity, "If he has any thing left, let him keep it: his &s;ufferings have been great: he &s;hall have his liberty." Mr. Holwell and his friends were no &s;ooner unfettered, than they took water for the Dutch Tank&s;all or mint, in the neighbourhood of the city, where they were received with great ten|derne&s;s and humanity.

<P>By the reduction of Calcutta, the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-India company's affairs were &s;o much embroiled in that part of the world, that perhaps nothing could have retrieved them but the interpo&s;ition of a na|tional force and the good fortune of a Clive, who&s;e enterprizes were always crowned with &s;ucce&s;s. In con&s;equence of the company's repre&s;entations to the government, a &s;mall &s;quadron of large &s;hips was &s;ent to the Ea&s;t-Indies, under the command of ad|miral Wat&s;on; and in the cour&s;e of this year ar|rived at Fort St. David's. The governor of that fortre&s;s having received intelligence that Tullagee Angria, a piratical prince in the neighbourhood of Bombay, was on the eve of concluding a treaty with the nation of the Marahattas, which might

He was in the fourth generation from the fir&s;t freebooter, who rendered him&s;elf independent, and lived like a &s;overeign prince po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of exten&s;ive territories. The un|dertaking again&s;t Angria was originally concerted with the Marahattas, who likewi&s;e equipped an armament both by &s;ea and land again&s;t Geriah; but they acted entirely on their own &s;core: and in the reduction of the place gave no manner of a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance to the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>Admiral Wat&s;on &s;ailed from the coa&s;t of Coro|mandel to Bombay, where his &s;quadron was cleaned and refitted; and having procured proper intelli|gence with re&s;pect to the harbour and fort of Ge|riah, determined, with the advice of a council of war to proceed on the expedition without delay. Being joined by a divi&s;ion of &s;hips, fitted out at the company's expence, having on board a body of troops commanded by colonel Clive, he &s;ailed on the &s;eventh day of February, and found in the neighbourhood of Geriah the Marahatta fleet, con|&s;i&s;ting of four grabs and forty &s;maller ve&s;&s;els, called gallivats, lying to the northward of the place, in a creek called Rajipore; and a land-army of hor&s;e and foot, amounting to &s;even or eight thou&s;and men, the whole commanded by Rhamagee Punt,
<PB N="372" REF="3860">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> who had already taken one &s;mall fort, and was ac|tually treating about the &s;urrender of Geriah. Angria him&s;elf had quitted the place; but his wife and family remained under the protection of his brother-in-law; who, being &s;ummoned to &s;urren|der, by a me&s;&s;age from the admiral, replied, that he would defend the place to the la&s;t extremity. In con&s;equence of this refu&s;al the whole Engli&s;h fleet, in two divi&s;ions, &s;ailed on the twelfth day of Fe|bruary into the harbour, and &s;u&s;tained a warm fire from the enemy's batteries as they pa&s;&s;ed, as well as from the grabs po&s;ted in the harbour for this purpo&s;e: this, however, was &s;oon &s;ilenced after the &s;hips were brought to their &s;tations, &s;o as to re|turn the &s;alutation. Between the hours of four and five in the afternoon, a &s;hell being thrown into one of Angria's armed ve&s;&s;els, &s;et her on fire; and the flames communicating to the re&s;t, they were all de&s;troyed: between &s;ix and &s;even the fort was &s;et on fire by another &s;hell; and &s;oon after the firing cea&s;ed on both &s;ides. The admiral &s;u&s;pecting that the governor of the place would &s;urrender it to the Marahattas rather than to the Engli&s;h, di&s;|embarked all the trooops under Mr. Clive, that he might be at hand in ca&s;e of emergency to take po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion. In the mean time the fort was bom|barded: the line of battle &s;hips were warped near enough to batter in breach; and then the admiral &s;ent an officer with a flag of truce to the governor, requiring him to &s;urrender. His propo&s;al being again rejected, the Engli&s;h &s;hips renewed their fire next day with redoubled vigour. About one o'clock the magazine of the fort blew up, and at four the garri&s;on hung out a white flag for capitu|lation.
<PB N="373" REF="3870">
The parley that en&s;ued, proving ineffec|tual,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> the engagement began again, and continued till fifteen minutes after five; when the white flag was again di&s;played, and now the governor &s;ub|mitted to the terms which were impo&s;ed. An|gria's flag was immedlately hauled down; and two Engli&s;h captains taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fort with a detachment, forthwith hoi&s;ted the Briti&s;h en&s;ign. In this place, which was reduced with very incon|&s;iderable<NOTE PLACE="marg">His fort of Geriah attacked and taken by admi|ral Wat|&s;on and Mr. Clive.</NOTE> lo&s;s, the conquerors found above two hundred cannon, &s;ix bra&s;s mortars, a large quan|tity of ammunition, with money and effects to the value of one hundred and thirty thou&s;and pounds. The fleet which was de&s;troyed, con&s;i&s;ted of eight grabs, one &s;hip fini&s;hed, two upon the &s;tocks, and a good number of gallivats. Among the pri&s;oners the admiral found Angria's wife, children, and mother, towards whom he demeaned him&s;elf with great humanity. Three hundred European fol|diers, and as many &s;ipoys were left to guard the fort; and four of the company's armed ve&s;&s;els re|mained in the harbour for the defence of the place, which was extremely well &s;ituated for commerce <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When the admiral entered their apartment, the whole fa|mily &s;hedding floods of tears fell with their faces to the ground; from which being rai&s;ed, the mother of Angria told him, in a piteous tone, the people had no king, &s;he no &s;on, her daughter no hu&s;|band, their children no father. The admiral replying, "they mu&s;t look upon him as their father and their friend;" the younge&s;t boy, about &s;ix years of age, &s;eized him by the hand, and &s;obbing exclaimed, "then you &s;hall be my fa|ther." Mr. Wat&s;on was &s;o affected with this pathetic ad|dre&s;s, that the tears trickled down his cheeks, while he a&s;|&s;ured them they might depend upon his protection and friend|&s;hip.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The admiral and Mr. Clive &s;ailed back to Ma|dra&s;s in triumph, and there another plan was

In October they &s;et &s;ail again for the bottom of the bay; and about the beginning of December arrived at Bala|&s;ore in the kingdom of Bengal. Having cro&s;&s;ed the Braces, they proceeded up the river Ganges as far as Falta, where they found governor Drake and the other per&s;ons who had e&s;caped on board of the &s;hips when Calcutta was inve&s;ted. Colonel Clive was di&s;embarked with his forces to attack the fort of Bu&s;budgia by land, while the admiral bat|tered it by &s;ea: but the place being ill provided with cannon, did not hold out above an hour after the firing began. This conque&s;t being atchieved at a very ea&s;y purcha&s;e, two of the great &s;hips an|chored between Tanna fort and a battery on the other &s;ide of the river, which were abandoned be|fore one &s;hot was di&s;charged again&s;t either; thus the pa&s;&s;age was laid open to Calcutta, the reduc|tion of which we &s;hall record among the tran&s;ac|tions of the en&s;uing year.</P>

<PB N="375" REF="3890">
by which he was at all acce&s;&s;ible to the efforts of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> the enemy, who he fore&s;aw would not fail to annoy him through that avenue. He at that time &s;tood upon indifferent terms with the k&mdash;of P&mdash;, who was con&s;idered as a partizan and ally of France; and he knew that the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria alone would not be &s;ufficient to &s;upport him again&s;t two &s;uch powerful antagoni&s;ts. In this emer|gency he had recour&s;e to the empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, who, in con&s;equence of a large &s;ub&s;idy granted by England, engaged to furni&s;h a &s;trong body of forces for the defence of H&mdash;r. His P&mdash;n maje&s;ty, &s;tartled at the conditions of this treaty, took an opportunity to declare that he would not &s;uffer foreign forces of any nation to enter the em|pire, either as principals or auxiliaries: a declara|tion which probably flowed from a jealou&s;y and aver&s;ion he had conceived to the court of Peter&s;|burg, as well as to a re&s;olution he had formed of &s;triking &s;ome great &s;troke in Germany, without any ri&s;que of being re&s;tricted or controuled. He knew he &s;hould give umbrage to the French king, who had already made preparations for penetrating into We&s;tphalia: but he took it for granted he &s;hould be able to exchange his connexions with France for an alliance with Great Britain, which would be much le&s;s trouble&s;ome, and much more productive of advantage: indeed &s;uch an alliance was the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of his declaration. Had his B&mdash;c m&mdash;y made a requi&s;ition of the Ru&s;&s;ian auxiliaries, he mu&s;t have expo&s;ed him|&s;elf to the re&s;entment of a warlike monarch, that hovered on the &s;kirts of his electorate at the head of one hundred and fifty thou&s;and men, and could

As for the Empre&s;s queen, her attention was engro&s;&s;ed by &s;chemes for her intere&s;t or pre&s;ervation; and her hands &s;o full that &s;he either could not, or would not fulfil the engagements &s;he had contracted with her former and firme&s;t allies. In the&s;e circum&s;tances the k&mdash;g of E&mdash;d &s;ought and obtained the alliance of P&mdash;a, which, to the be&s;t of our comprehen|&s;ion, has intailed upon G&mdash;B&mdash;n the enormous burthen of extravagant &s;ub&s;idies, together with the intolerable expence of a continental war, without being productive of one advantage either po&s;itive or negative to E&mdash;d or H&mdash;r. On the con|trary, this connexion threw the Empre&s;s queen into the arms of France, who&s;e friend&s;hip &s;he has bought at the expence of the Barrier in the Nether|lands, acquired with infinite labour, by the blood and trea&s;ure of the maritime powers: it has given birth to a confederacy of de&s;potic princes; &s;uffi|cient, if their joint force was fully exerted, to overthrow the liberties of all the free &s;tates in Eu|rope; and, after all, H&mdash;r has been over-run, and &s;ubdued by the enemy; and the k&mdash;g of P&mdash;a put to the ban of the Empire. All the&s;e con&s;e|quences are, we apprehend, fairly deducible from the re&s;olution which his P&mdash;n m&mdash;y took, at this juncture, to precipitate a war with the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria.</P>
<P>The apparent motives that prompted him to this mea&s;ure, we &s;hall pre&s;ently explain. In the mean

<P>At the &s;ame time intrigues were begun by the French emi&s;&s;aries in the &s;enate of Sweden, in order to kindle up a war between that nation and Pru&s;&s;ia; and their endeavours &s;ucceeded in the &s;equel, even contrary to the inclination of their &s;overeign.

<P>The cry of religion was no impolitic mea&s;ure; but it no longer produced the &s;ame effect as in times pa&s;t.

It ap|pears, however, that the count de Bruhl, prime mini&s;ter and favourite of the king of Poland, had in conjunction with &s;ome of the Au&s;trian mini&s;ters, carried on certain &s;candalous intrigues, in order to embroil the king of Pru&s;&s;ia with the empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, between whom a mi&s;under&s;tanding had long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted.</P>

<P>This an&s;wer, though &s;eemingly explicit, was not deemed &s;ufficiently categorical, or at lea&s;t not &s;uit|able to the purpo&s;es of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, who, by his re&s;ident at Vienna, once more declared, that if the Empre&s;s-queen would &s;ign a po&s;itive a&s;|&s;urance that &s;he would not attack his Pru&s;&s;ian ma|je&s;ty either this year or the next, he would directly withdraw his troops, and let things be re&s;tored to their former footing. This demand was evaded, on pretence that &s;uch an a&s;&s;urance could not be more binding than the &s;olemn treaty by which he was al|ready &s;ecured; a treaty which the Empre&s;s-queen had no intention to violate. But before an an&s;wer could be delivered, the king had actually invaded<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pru&s;|&s;ian army enters Saxony, and pub|li&s;hes a mani|fe&s;to.</NOTE> Saxony, and publi&s;hed his declaration again&s;t the court of Vienna. The court of Vienna believ|ing that the king of Pru&s;&s;ia was bent upon em|ploying his arms &s;omewhere; being piqued at the dictatorial manner in which his demands were conveyed; unwilling to lay them&s;elves under far|ther re&s;trictions; apprehen&s;ive of giving umbrage to their allies; and confident of having provided for their own &s;ecurity; re&s;olved to run the ri&s;que of his re&s;entment, not without hope of being indemnified in the cour&s;e of the war for that part of Sile&s;ia which the queen had been obliged to cede in the treaty of Bre&s;lau.</P>
<P>Both &s;ides being thus prepared, and perhaps equally eager for action, the king of Pru&s;&s;ia would no longer &s;u&s;pend his operations; and the &s;torm fir&s;t fell upon Saxony. He re&s;olved to penetrate through this country into Bohemia, and even to

Be&s;ides, he had rea&s;on to believe the king of Poland, elector of Saxony, was connected with the Czarina and the Empre&s;s-queen: therefore he thought it would be impolitic to leave that prince in any condi|tion to give him the lea&s;t di&s;turbance. His army entered the Saxon territory towards the latter end of Augu&s;t; when he publi&s;hed a decla|ration, importing that the unju&s;t conduct and dan|gerous views of the court of Vienna again&s;t his ma|je&s;ty's dominions, laid him under the nece&s;&s;ity of taking proper mea&s;ures for protecting his territo|ries and &s;ubjects: that for this purpo&s;e he could not forbear taking the di&s;agreeable re&s;olution to en|ter with his troops the hereditary dominions of his maje&s;ty the king of Poland, elector of Saxony: but he prote&s;ted before God and man, that on ac|count of his per&s;onal e&s;teem and friend&s;hip for that prince, he would not have proceeded to this extre|mity, had he not been forced to it by the laws of war, the fatality of the pre&s;ent conjuncture, and the nece&s;&s;ity of providing for the defence and &s;e|curity of his &s;ubjects. He reminded the public of the tenderne&s;s with which he had treated the elec|tor of Saxony, during the campaign of the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and forty&punc;four; and of the bad con&s;equences re&s;ulting to that monarch from his engagements with the enemies of Pru&s;&s;ia. He declared that the apprehen&s;ions of being expo&s;ed again to &s;uch enterprizes, had obliged him to take tho&s;e precautions which prudence dictated: but he prote&s;ted, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, that he had

But the&s;e were formalities which did not at all &s;uit with his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty's di&s;po&s;ition or de&s;ign. Even be|fore this requi&s;ition was made, a body of his troops, amounting to fifteen thou&s;and, under the command of prince Ferdinand, brother to the Duke of Brun&s;|wic,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince Ferdinand takes po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of Leip&s;ic.</NOTE> took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Leip&s;ic on the twentieth day of September.

That &s;ame evening notice was given to the corporation of merchants, that their deputies &s;hould pay all taxes and cu&s;toms to the king of Pru&s;&s;ia: then he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e and exci&s;e|office,

On the twenty-ninth day of September he formed his troops in two columns, and in the evening arrived with his van at Welmina, from when$e he &s;aw the Au&s;trian army po&s;ted with its right at Lowo&s;chutz, and its left towards the Egra. Having occupied with &s;ix battalions a hollow way, and &s;ome ri&s;ing grounds, which commanded the town of Lowo|&s;chutz, he remained all night under arms at Wel|mina; and on the fir&s;t day of October, early in the morning, formed his whole army in order of battle; the fir&s;t line, con&s;i&s;ting of the infantry, occupying two hi ls, and a bottom betwixt them; the &s;econd line being formed of &s;ome battalions, and the third compo&s;ed of the whole cavalry. The Au&s;trian ge|neral had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Lowo&s;chutz with a great body of infantry, and placed a battery of cannon in the front of the town: he had formed his cavalry chequerwi&s;e, in a line between Lowo|&s;chutz and the village of San&s;chitz; and po&s;ted about two thou&s;and Croats and irregulars in the<NOTE PLACE="marg">and he fights the battle of Lowo|&s;chutz.</NOTE> vineyards and avenues on his right. The morn|ing was darkened with a thick fog, which vani&s;hed about &s;even: then the Pru&s;&s;ian cavalry advanced to attack the enemy's hor&s;e; but received &s;uch a fire from the irregulars, po&s;ted in vineyards, and
<PB N="391" REF="4050">
ditches, as well as from a numerous artillery, that<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> they were obliged to retire for protection to the rear of the Pru&s;&s;ian infantry and cannon. There being formed, and led back to the charge, they made an impre&s;&s;ion on the Au&s;trian cavalry, and drove the irregulars and other bodies of infantry from the ditches, de&s;iles, and vineyards which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed: but they &s;uffered &s;o &s;everely in this dan|gerous &s;ervice, that the king ordered them to re|a&s;cend the hill, and take po&s;t again behind the in|fantry, from whence they no more advanced. In the mean time a furious cannonading was main|tained on both &s;ides, with con&s;iderable effect. At length the left of the Pru&s;&s;ian infantry was ordered to attack the town of Lowo&s;chutz in flank; but met with a very warm reception, and, in all like|lihood, would have mi&s;carried, had not veldt-marechal Keith headed them in per&s;on: when he drew his &s;word, and told them he would lead them on, he was given to under&s;tand, that all their pow|der and &s;hot was exhau&s;ted: he turned imme|diately to them with a chearful countenance, &s;aid he was very glad they had no more ammunition, being well a&s;&s;ured the enemy would not with&s;tand them at pu&s;h of bayonet: &s;o &s;aying, he advanced at their head, and driving the Au&s;trians from Lowo|&s;chutz, &s;et the &s;uburbs on fire. Their infantry had been already obliged to quit the eminen$e on the right, and now their whole army retired to Budin, on the other &s;ide of the Egra. Some pri|&s;oners, colours, and pieces of cannon, were taken on both &s;ides; and the lo&s;s of each might amount to two thou&s;and five hundred killed and wounded: &s;o that, on the whole, it was a drawn battle, though
<PB N="392" REF="4060">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> both generals claimed the victory. The detail of the action, publi&s;hed at Berlin, declares, that the king of Pru&s;&s;ia not only gained the battle, but that &s;ame day e&s;tabli&s;hed his head-quarters at Lowo|&s;chutz: whereas the Au&s;trian gazette affirms, that the marechal count Brown obliged his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty to retire, and remained all night on the field of battle; but next day, finding his troops in want of water, he repaired to the camp of Budin. If the battle was at all deci&s;ive, the advantage cer|tainly fell to the Au&s;trians; for his Pru&s;&s;ian ma|je&s;ty, who, in all probability, had hoped to winter at Prague, was obliged, by the oppo&s;ition he met with, to re&s;ign this plan, and retreat before winter into the electorate of Saxony.</P>
<P>The Pru&s;&s;ian army having rejoined that body which had been left to block up the Saxons at Pirna, his Poli&s;h maje&s;ty and his troops were re|duced to &s;uch extremity of want, that it became indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary either to attempt an e&s;cape, or &s;urrender to the king of Pru&s;&s;ia. The former part of the alternative was cho&s;en, and the plan concerted with count Brown, the Au&s;trian general, who, in order to facilitate the execution, advanced privately with a body of troops to Lichtendorf, near Schandau; but the junction could not be ef|fected. On the fourteenth day of October the Saxons threw a bridge of boats over the Elbe near Konig&s;tein, to which ca&s;tle they removed all their artillery: then &s;triking their tents in the night, pa&s;&s;ed the river undi&s;covered by the enemy. They continued to retreat with all po&s;&s;ible expedition; but, the roads were &s;o bad, they made little pro|g$e&s;s. Next day, when part of them had ad|vanced

<P>In this deplorable condition they remained, when the king of Poland, from the fortre&s;s of Konig|&s;tein, &s;ent a letter to his general the veldt-marechal count Rutow&s;ki, ve&s;ting him with full and di&s;cre|tionary power to &s;urrender, or take &s;uch other mea&s;ures as he &s;hould judge mo&s;t conducive to the pre&s;ervation of the officers and &s;oldiers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The letter was to the fol|lowing effect:

<P>The king of Poland, being thus deprived of his electoral dominions, his troops, arms, artillery, and ammunition, thought it high time to provide for his own &s;afety, and retired with all expedition to Poland. His Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty cantoned his forces in the neighbourhood of Seidlitz, and along the Elbe towards Dre&s;den. His other army, which had entered Bohemia under the command of the count de Schwerin, retired to the confines of the county of Glatz, where they were di&s;tributed in quarters of cantonment; &s;o that this &s;hort cam|paign was fini&s;hed by the beginning of November.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">King of Poland's memorial to the States General.</NOTE> The king of Poland, in his di&s;tre&s;s, did not fail to implore the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and mediation of neutral powers. His mini&s;ter at the Hague pre&s;ented a memorial to the States General, complaining, that the inva&s;ion of Saxony was one of the&s;e attacks again&s;t the law of nations, which, from the great re&s;pect due to this law, demanded the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of every power intere&s;ted in the pre&s;ervation of its own liberty and independency. He ob&s;erved, that, from the fir&s;t glimp&s;e of mi&s;under&s;tanding between the courts of Vienna and Berlin, he had expre&s;ly enjoined his mini&s;ters at all the courts of Europe to declare, that it was his firm re&s;olution, in the pre&s;ent conjuncture of affairs, to ob&s;erve the &s;trict|e&s;t neutrality. He repre&s;ented that a free and neutral &s;tate had been, in the mid&s;t of peace, in|vaded by an enemy who di&s;gui&s;ed him&s;elf under

the ma&s;que of friend&s;hip, without alledging the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> lea&s;t complaint, or any preten&s;ion what&s;oever; but founding him&s;elf &s;olely on his own convenience, made him&s;elf ma&s;ter, by armed force, of all the ci|ties and towns of the electorate, di&s;mantling &s;ome, and fortifying others: that he had di&s;armed the burghers; carried off the magi&s;trates as ho&s;tages for the payment of unju&s;t and enormous contribu|tions of provi&s;ions and forage; &s;eized the coffers, confi&s;cated the revenues of the electorate, broke open the ar&s;enals, and tran&s;ported the arms and artillery to his own town of Magdeburg; aboli&s;hed the privy-council, and, in&s;tead of the lawful go|vernment, e&s;tabli&s;hed a directory, which acknow|ledged no other law but his own arbitrary will. He gave them to under&s;tand, that all the&s;e pro|ceedings were no other than preliminaries to the unheard&punc;of treatment which was re&s;erved for a queen, who&s;e virtues ought to have commanded re&s;pect, even from her enemies: that, from the hands of that augu&s;t prince&s;s, the archives of the &s;tate were forced away by menaces and violences, notwith&s;tanding the &s;ecurity which her maje&s;ty had promi&s;ed her&s;elf under the protection of all laws, human and divine; and notwith&s;tanding the re|peated a&s;&s;urances given by the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, that not only her per&s;on, and the place of her re&s;i|dence, &s;hould be ab&s;olutely &s;afe, but that even the Pru&s;&s;ian garri&s;on &s;hould be under her direction. He ob&s;erved, that a prince who declared him&s;elf protector of the prote&s;tant religion had begun the war, by cru&s;hing the very &s;tate to which that very religion owes its e&s;tabli&s;hment, and the pre&s;erva|tion of its mo&s;t invaluable rights: that he had
<PB N="396" REF="4100">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> broke through the mo&s;t re&s;pectable laws which con&s;titute the union of the Germanic body, under colour of a defence which the Empire &s;tood in no need of, except again&s;t him&s;elf: that the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, while he in&s;i&s;ts on having entered Saxony as a friend, demands his army, the admini&s;tration of his dominions, and, in a word, the &s;acrifice of his whole electorate; and that the Pru&s;&s;ian direc|tory, in the declaration of motives, publi&s;hed un|der the no&s;e of a prince to whom friend&s;hip was pretended, thought it &s;uperfluous to alledge even any pretext, to colour the u&s;urpation of his terri|tories and revenues.</P>
<P>Though this was certainly the ca&s;e, in his Pru&s;|&s;ian maje&s;ty's fir&s;t expo&s;ition of motives, the omi&s;|&s;ion was afterwards &s;upplied in a &s;ub&s;equent me|morial to the States General; in which he charged the king of Poland, as an accomplice in, if not an acce&s;&s;ory to the treaty of Peter&s;burg; and even taxed him with having agreed to a partition of &s;ome Pru&s;&s;ian territories, when they &s;hould be con|quered. This treaty of partition, however, ap|pears to have been made in time of actual war, be|fore all cau&s;e of di&s;pute was removed by the peace of Dre&s;den.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Imperial decrees publi&s;hed again&s;t the king of Pru&s;&s;ia.</NOTE> While the Au&s;trian and Pru&s;&s;ian armies were in the field, their re&s;pective mini&s;ters were not idle at Rati&s;bon, where three Imperial decrees were publi&s;hed again&s;t his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty: the fir&s;t, &s;ummoning that prince to withdraw his troops from the electorate of Saxony; the &s;econd, commanding all the va&s;&s;als of the empire employed by the king of Pru&s;&s;ia to quit that &s;ervice immediately; and the third, forbidding the members of the Empire

The French mini&s;ter declared to the dyet, that the proceedings of his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty having di&s;clo&s;ed to the world the project concerted be|tween that prince and the king of England, to ex|cite in the Empire a religious war, which might be favourable to their particular views, his mo&s;t Chri&s;|tian maje&s;ty, in con&s;equence of his engagements with the Empre&s;s-queen, and many other princes of the Empire, being re&s;olved to &s;uccour them in the mo&s;t efficacious manner, would forth with &s;end &s;uch a number of troops to their aid, as might be thought nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve the liberty of the Germanic body.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the Pru&s;&s;ian mini&s;ter a&s;&s;ured the dyet, that his ma&s;ter would very &s;oon produce the proofs that were come to his hands of the plan concerted by the courts of Vienna and Dre&s;den, for the &s;ubver&s;ion of his electoral hou&s;e, and for impo&s;ing upon him a yoke, which &s;eemed to threaten the whole Empire.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Declara|tions of different powers.</NOTE> About the &s;ame time the Ru&s;&s;ian re&s;ident at the Hague communicated to the States General a de|claration from his mi&s;tre&s;s, importing, that her Imperial majecty having &s;een a memorial pre&s;ented at the court of Vienna by the king of Pru&s;&s;ia's en|voy extraordinary, was thereby convinced that his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty's intention was to attack the ter|ritories of the Empre&s;s-queen; in which ca&s;e, &s;he (the Czarina) was inevitably obliged to &s;uccour her ally with all her forces; for which end &s;he had or|dered all her troops in Livonia to be forth with a&s;|&s;embled on the frontiers, and hold them&s;elves in

The mini&s;ters of the Empre&s;s-queen, both at the Hague and at London, delivered memorials to the States Gene|ral and his Britannic maje&s;ty, demanding the &s;uc|cours which the&s;e two powers were bound to af|ford the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria by the treaty of Aix-la&punc; Chapelle; but their high mightine&s;&s;es kept warily aloof by dint of eva&s;ion, and the king of Great Britain was far otherwi&s;e engaged.</P>
<P>The inva&s;ion of Saxony had well nigh produced tragedies in the royal family of France. The dau|phine&s;s, who was far advanced in her pregnancy, no &s;ooner learned the di&s;tre&s;sful circum&s;tances of her parents, the king and queen of Poland, than &s;he was &s;eized with violent fits, which occa&s;ioned a mi&s;carriage, and brought her life into the mo&s;t imminent danger.</P>
<P>The Pru&s;&s;ian mini&s;ter was immediately ordered to quit Ver&s;ailles; and directions were di&s;patched to the French mini&s;ter at Berlin, to retire from that court without taking leave. Finally, the em|peror of Germany concluded a new convention with the French king, regulating the &s;uccours to be derived from that quarter: he claimed in all the u&s;ual forms, the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Germanic body as guaranty of the pragmatic &s;anction and treaty of Dre&s;den; and Sweden was al&s;o addre&s;&s;ed on the &s;ame &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The king of Pru&s;&s;ia did not pa&s;&s;ively bear all the imputations that were fixed upon his conduct. His mini&s;ter at the Hague pre&s;ented a memorial
<PB N="399" REF="4130">
in an&s;wer to that of the Saxon re&s;ident, in which<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756. His Pru&s;|&s;ian ma|je&s;ty's an|&s;wer to the Saxon memo|rial.</NOTE> he accu&s;ed the court of Dre&s;den of having adopted every part of the &s;cheme which his enemies had formed for his de&s;truction. He affirmed that the Saxon mini&s;ters had, in all the courts of Europe, played off every engine of unwarrantable politics, in order to pave the way for the execution of their project: that they had endeavoured to give an odious turn to his mo&s;t innocent actions: that they had &s;pared neither malicious in&s;inuations, nor even the mo&s;t atrocious calumnies, to alienate all the world from his maje&s;ty, and rai&s;e up enemies again&s;t him every where. He &s;aid he had received inform|ation that the court of Saxony intended to let his troops pa&s;s freely, and afterwards wait for events of which they might avail them&s;elves, either by joining his enemies, or making a diver&s;ion in his dominions: that in &s;uch a &s;ituation he could not avoid having recour&s;e to the only means which were left him for preventing his inevitable ruin, by putting it out of the power of Saxony to encrea&s;e the number of his enemies. He a&s;&s;erted that all the mea&s;ures he had pur&s;ued in that electorate were but the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences of the fir&s;t re|&s;olution he was forced to take for his own pre&s;er|vation: that he had done nothing but deprived the court of Saxony of the means of hurting him; and this had been done with all po&s;&s;ible moderation: that the country enjoyed all the &s;ecurity and all the quiet which could be expected in the very mid&s;t of peace, the Pru&s;&s;ian troops ob&s;erving the mo&s;t exact di&s;cipline: that all due re&s;pect was &s;hewn to the queen of Poland, who had been prevailed upon by the mo&s;t &s;uitable repre&s;entations, to &s;uffer &s;ome

Accordingly the&s;e two powers did, in fact, conclude a defen&s;ive alliance at Peter&s;burg in the cour&s;e of the en&s;uing year: but the body or o&s;ten&s;ible part of this treaty was compo&s;ed meerly with a view to conceal from the knowledge of the public, &s;ix &s;ecret articles, the fourth of which was levelled &s;ingly again&s;t Pru&s;&s;ia, according to the exact copy of it, which appeared among the docu|ments.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> again&s;t the court of Vienna; but he in|&s;i&s;ted, that even in this ca&s;e the king of Poland could have no right to make conque&s;ts on his Pru&s;|&s;ian maje&s;ty. He likewi&s;e acknowledged that the court of Saxony had not yet acceded in form to the treaty of Peter&s;burg; but he ob&s;erved, its al|lies were given to under&s;tand again and again, that it was ready to accede without re&s;triction, whenever this could be done without ri&s;que; and the advan|tages to be gained &s;hould be &s;ecured in its favour: circum&s;tances proved by divers authentic docu|ments, particularly by a letter from count Fleming to count de Bruhl, informing him that count Uhlefield had charged him to repre&s;ent afre&s;h to h s court, that they could not take too &s;ecure mea|&s;ures again&s;t the ambitious views of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia; that Saxony in particular, ought to be cautious, as being the mo&s;t expo&s;ed: that it was of the highe&s;t importance to &s;trengthen their old en|gagements upon the footing propo&s;ed by the late count de Harrach in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and forty five; a &s;tep which might be taken on occa&s;ion of his Poli&s;h maje&s;ty's acce&s;&s;ion to the treaty of Peter&s;burg. The an&s;wer of count Bruhl to this di&s;patch imported, that the king of Poland was not aver&s;e to treat in the utmo&s;t &s;e|crecy with the court of Vienna, about &s;uccours, by private and confidential declarations relating to the fourth &s;ecret article of the treaty of Peter&s;burg, on condition of rea&s;onable terms and advantages, which in this ca&s;e ought to be granted to his ma|je&s;ty. He quoted other di&s;patches to prove the un|willingne&s;s of his Poli&s;h maje&s;ty to declare him&s;elf, until the king of Pru&s;&s;ia &s;hould be attacked, and
<PB N="405" REF="4190">
his forces divided; and that this &s;cruple was ad|mitted<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> by the allies of Saxony. From the&s;e pre|mi&s;es he deduced this inference, that the court of Dre&s;den, without having acceded in form to the treaty of Peter&s;burg, was not le&s;s an accomplice in the dangerous de&s;igns which the court of Vienna had grounded upon this treaty; and that having been di&s;pen&s;ed with from a formal concurrence, it had only waited for that moment when it might, without running any great ri&s;que, concur in effect, and &s;hare the &s;poils of its neighbour. In expecta|tion of this period, he &s;aid the Au&s;trian and Saxon mini&s;ters laboured in concert and underhand with the more ardour, to bring the Ca&s;us Foederis into exi&s;tence; for it being laid down as a principle in the treaty, that any war whatever between him and Ru&s;&s;ia, would authori&s;e the Empre&s;s-queen to re|take Sile&s;ia, there was nothing more to be done but to kindle &s;uch a war; for which purpo&s;e no method was found more proper than that of em|broiling the king with the empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia; and to provoke that prince&s;s, with all &s;orts of fal&s;e in|&s;inuations, impo&s;tures, and the mo&s;t atrocious ca|lumnies, in laying to his maje&s;ty's charge a variety of de&s;igns, &s;ometimes again&s;t Ru&s;&s;ia, and even the per&s;on of the Czarina; &s;ometimes views upon Poland, and &s;ometimes intrigues in Sweden. By the&s;e and other &s;uch contrivances, he affirmed they had kind|led the animo&s;ity of the Empre&s;s to &s;uch a degree, that in a couucil held in the month of October, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty three, &s;he had re&s;olved to attack the king of Pru&s;&s;ia with|out any further di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, whether he &s;hould fall upon any of the allies of Ru&s;&s;ia, or one of them

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> &s;hould begin with him: a re&s;olution which for that time was fru&s;trated by their want of &s;eamen and magazines; but the preparations were continued, under pretence of keeping them&s;elves in a condi|tion to fulfil their engagements contracted in the la&s;t &s;ub&s;idiary convention with England; and when all were fini&s;hed, the &s;torm would fall on the king of Pru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarks on th$$e piece$.</NOTE> This is the &s;ub&s;tance of that famous memorial publi&s;hed by his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty, to which the ju&s;tifying pieces or authentic documents were an|nexed; and to which a circum&s;tantial an&s;wer was exhibited by the parti&s;ans of her Imperial maje&s;ty. Specious rea&s;ons may, doubtle&s;s, be adduced on either &s;ide of almo&s;t any di&s;pute, by writers of in|genuity: but, in examining this conte&s;t, it mu&s;t be allowed that both &s;ides adopted illicit practices. The Empre&s;s-queen and the elector of Saxony had certainly a right to form defen&s;ive treaties for their own pre&s;ervation; and without all doubt, it was their intere&s;t and their duty to &s;ecure them&s;elves from the enterprizes of &s;uch a formidable neigh|bour: but at the &s;ame time the contracting parties &s;eem to have carried their views much farther than defen&s;ive mea&s;ures. Perhaps the court of Vienna con&s;idered the ce&s;&s;ion of Sile&s;ia as a circum&s;tance altogether compul&s;ive, and therefore not binding again&s;t the rights of natural equity. She did not at all doubt that the king of Pru&s;&s;ia would be tempted by his ambition and great warlike power, to take &s;ome &s;tep which might be ju&s;tly interpreted into an infraction of the treaty of Dre&s;den; and in that ca&s;e &s;he was determined to avail her&s;elf of the confederacy &s;he had formed, that &s;he might re|trieve
<PB N="407" REF="4210">
the countries &s;he had lo&s;t by the unfortunate<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> events of the la&s;t war, as well as bridle the dange|rous power and di&s;po&s;ition of the Pru&s;&s;ian mo|narch: and in all probability, the king of Poland, over and above the &s;ame con&s;ideration, was de&s;irous of &s;ome indemnification for the la&s;t irruption in$o his electoral dominions, and the great &s;ums he had paid for the &s;ub&s;equent peace. Whether they were authori&s;ed by the law of nature and nations to make repri&s;als by an actual partition of the coun|tries they might conquer, &s;uppo&s;ing him to be the aggre&s;&s;or, we &s;hall not pretend to determine: but it does not at all appear that his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty's danger was &s;uch as intitled him to take tho&s;e vio|lent &s;teps which he now attempted to ju&s;tify. By this time the flame of war was kindled up to a blaze that &s;oon filled the empire with ruin and de|&s;olation; and the king of P$u&s;&s;ia had drawn upon him&s;elf the re&s;entment of the three greate&s;t powers in Europe, who laid a&s;ide their former animo&s;ities, and every con&s;ideration of that balance, which it had co&s;t &s;uch blood and trea&s;ure to pre&s;erve, in or|der to con&s;pire his de&s;truction. The king him|&s;elf could not but fore&s;ee this confederacy, and know the power it might exert: but probably he confided &s;o much in the number, the valour and di&s;cipline of his troops; in the &s;kill of his officers; in his own conduct and activity; that he hoped to cru&s;h the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria by one rapid endeavour at the latter end of the &s;ea&s;on, or at lea&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h him&s;elf in Bohemia, before her allies could move to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. In this hope, however, he was di&s;appointed by the vigilance of the Au&s;trian coun|cils. He found the Empre&s;s-queen in a condition
<PB N="408" REF="4220">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> to make head again&s;t him in every avenue to her dominions; and in a fair way of being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the circles of the empire. He &s;aw him&s;elf threat|ened with the vengeance of the Ru&s;&s;ian empre&s;s, and the &s;word of France gleaming over his head, without any pro&s;pect of a&s;&s;i&s;tance but that which he might derive from his alliance with Great Britain. Thus the k&mdash;of E&mdash;d exchanged the alliance of R&mdash;, which was his &s;ub&s;idiary, and the friend|&s;hip of the Empre&s;s-queen, his old and natural ally, for a new connexion with his P&mdash;n maje&s;ty, who could neither act as an auxiliary to G&mdash;B&mdash;n, nor as a protector to H&mdash;r; and for this connec|tion, the advantage of which was merely nega|tive, &s;uch a price was paid by E&mdash;d, as had never been given by any other potentate of Europe, even for &s;ervices of the greate&s;t importance.</P>

The king being again brought over to the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;ide of the di&s;pute, received a brief from the pope, laying it down as a funda|mental article, that who&s;oever refu&s;es to &s;ubmit to the bull Unigenitus is in the way to damnation: and certain ca&s;es are &s;pecified in which the &s;a|craments are to be denied. The parliament of Paris, con&s;idering this brief or bull as a direct attack upon the rights of the Gall$can church, i&s;&s;ued an arret or decree &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the &s;aid bull; re&s;erving to them&s;elves the right of providing again&s;t the in|conveniencies with which it might be attended; as well as the privilege to maintain in their full force the prerogatives of the crown, the power and ju|ri&s;diction of the bi&s;hops, the liberties of the Gallican church, and the cu&s;toms of the realm. The king, di&s;&s;atis&s;ied with their interpo&s;ition, declared his de|&s;ign to hold a bed of ju&s;tice in per&s;on at the pa|lace. Accordingly, on the twelfth day of Novem|ber, the whole body of his guards, amounting to ten thou&s;and men, took po&s;t in the city of Paris: and next day the king repaired with the u&s;ual cere|mony to the palace where the bed of ju&s;tice was held: among other regulations, an edict was i&s;&s;ued for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the fourth and fifth cham|bers of inque&s;ts, the members of which had re|markably di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by their oppo|&s;ition to the bull Unigenitus.</P>

He &s;aid an adequate and firm defence at home &s;hould maintain the chief place in his thoughts; and in this great view he had nothing &s;o much at heart, as to remove all grounds of di&s;&s;atisfaction from his people: for this end, he recommended to the care and diligence of the parliament the framing of a national militia, planned and regu|lated with equal regard to the ju&s;t rights of his crown and people; an in&s;titution which might be|come one good re&s;ource in times of general dan|ger.

<P>The commons would have &s;till improved their humanity, had they contrived and e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;ome effectual method to puni&s;h tho&s;e unfeeling villains, who, by engro&s;&s;ing and hoarding up great quanti|ties of grain, had created this artificial &s;carcity, and deprived their fellow-creatures of bread, with a view to their own private advantage.

The hou&s;e would not lend a deaf ear to a remon&s;trance in which the revenue was concerned. The mem|bers appointed to prepare the bill, immediately re|ceived in&s;tructions to make provi&s;ion in it to re|&s;train, for a limited time, the di&s;tilling of barley, malt, and all grain what&s;oever. The bill was framed accordingly; but did not pa&s;s without &s;tre|nuous oppo&s;ition. To this prohibition it was ob|jected, that there are always large quantities of wheat and barley in the kingdom &s;o much da|maged, as to be unfit for any u&s;e but the di&s;tillery; con&s;equently a re&s;triction of this nature would ruin many farmers&punc; and others employed in the trade of malting, Particular intere&s;ts, however, mu&s;t often be &s;acrificed to the welfare of the communi|ty; and the pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s prevailed over the pro|&s;pect of this di&s;advantage. If they had allowed any &s;ort of grain to be di&s;tilled, it would have been impo&s;&s;ible to prevent the di&s;tilling of every kind. The prohibition was limited to two months; but at the expiration of that term, the &s;carcity &s;till con|tinuing,

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Act for importing American iron, duty free.</NOTE> Such are the connexions, dependencies, and re|lations &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the mechanical arts, agriculture, and manufactures of Great Britain, that it requires &s;tudy, deliberation, and enquiry in the legi&s;lature to di&s;cern and di&s;tingui&s;h the whole &s;cope and con&s;equences of many projects offered for the benefit of the commonwealth.

They affirmed that bar iron, im|ported from North America, would an&s;wer the &s;ame purpo&s;es; and the importation of it tend not

only to the great advantage of the kingdom, by<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> increa&s;ing its &s;hipping and navigation; but al&s;o to the benefit of the Briti&s;h colonies: that, by an act pa&s;&s;ed in the twenty third year of his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty's reign, the importation of bar iron from America into the port of London duty free, was permitted: but its being carried coa&s;tways, or farther by land than ten miles, had been prohi|bited; &s;o that &s;everal very con&s;iderable manufac|turing towns were deprived of the u&s;e of American iron, and the out-ports prevented from employ|ing it in their export commerce: they reque&s;ted, therefore, that bar iron might be imported from North America into Great Britain, duty free, by all his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects. This reque&s;t being re|inforced by many other petitions from different parts of the kingdom, other cla&s;&s;es of men, who thought their &s;everal intere&s;ts would be affected by &s;uch a mea&s;ure, took the alarm; and, in divers counter petitions, &s;pecified many ill con&s;equences which they alledged would ari&s;e from its being enacted into a law.

They a&s;&s;erted, that neither the American iron, nor any that had yet been found in Great Britain, was &s;o proper for convert|ing into Steel, as that which comes from Sweden, particularly that &s;ort called, ore ground; but as there are mines in the northern parts of Britain, nearly in the &s;ame latitude with tho&s;e of Sweden, furni&s;hed with &s;ufficient quantities of wood, and rivers for mills and engines, it was hardly to be doubted but that people would find metal of the &s;ame quality, and, in a few years, be able to pre|vent the nece&s;&s;ity of importing iron either from Sweden or Ru&s;&s;ia. They inferred, that American
<PB N="449" REF="4640">
iron could never interfere with that which Great<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> Britain imported from Sweden, becau&s;e it was not fit for edge-tools, anchors, chain-plates, and other particulars nece&s;&s;ary in &s;hip-building; nor dimi|ni&s;h the importation of Ru&s;&s;ia iron, which was not only harder than the American and Briti&s;h, but al&s;o could be afforded cheaper than that brought from our own plantations, even though the duty of this la&s;t &s;hould be removed. The importation of American iron, therefore, duty free, could in|terfere with no other &s;ort but that produced in Britain, with which, by means of this advantage, it would cla&s;h &s;o much, as to put a &s;top in a little time to all the iron works now carried on in the kingdom, and reduce to beggary a great number of families whom they &s;upport. To the&s;e objec|tions the favourers of the bill &s;ollicited, replied, that when a manufacture is much more valuable than the rough materials, and the&s;e cannot be pro|duced at home in &s;ufficient quantities, and at &s;uch a price as is con&s;i&s;tent with the pre&s;ervation of the manufacture, it is the intere&s;t of the legi&s;lature to admit a free importation of the&s;e materials, even from foreign countries, although it &s;hould put an end to the production of that material in this i&s;land: that as the neighbours of Great Britain are now more attentive than ever to their commercial intere&s;ts, and endeavouring to manufacture their rough materials at home, this nation mu&s;t take every method for lowering the price of materials, otherwi&s;e in a few years it will lo&s;e the manufac|ture; and, in&s;tead of &s;upplying other countries, be furni&s;hed by them with all the fine toys and uten&s;ils made of &s;teel and iron: that being in danger of

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> lo&s;ing not only the manufacture but the produce of iron, unle&s;s it can be procured at a cheaper rate than that for which it is &s;old at pre&s;ent; the only way of attaining this end, is by dimini&s;hing the duty payable upon the importation of foreign iron, or by rendering it nece&s;&s;ary for the undertakers of the iron mines in Great Britain to &s;ell their pro|duce cheaper than it has been for &s;ome years af|forded: that the mo&s;t effectual method for this pur|po&s;e is to rai&s;e up a rival, by permitting a free im|portation of all &s;orrs of iron from the American plantations: that American iron can never be &s;old &s;o cheap as that of Britain can be afforded; for, in the colonies, labour of all kinds is much dearer than in England: if a man employs his own &s;laves, he mu&s;t reckon in his charge a great deal more than the common intere&s;t of their purcha&s;e money, becau&s;e when one of them dies or e&s;capes from his ma&s;ter, he lo&s;es both intere&s;t and princi|pal: that the common intere&s;t of money in the plantations is con&s;iderably higher than in England, con&s;equently no man in that country will employ his money in any branch of trade by which he can|not gain con&s;iderably more per centum than is ex|pected in Great Britain, where the intere&s;t is low, and profit moderate; a circum&s;tance which will always give a great advantage to the Briti&s;h miner, who likewi&s;e enjoys an exemption from freight and in&s;urance, which lie heavy upon the American ad|venturer, e&s;pecially in time of war. With re&s;pect to the apprehen&s;ion of the leather tanners, they ob&s;erved, that as the coppices generally grew on barren lands, not fit for tillage, and improved the pa&s;turage, no proprietor would be at the expence

of grubbing up the wood to &s;poil the pa&s;ture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> as he could make no other u&s;e of the land on which it was produced. The wood mu&s;t be always worth &s;omething, e&s;pecially in counties where there is not plenty of coal, and the timber trees would produce con&s;iderable advantage: therefore, if there was not one iron mine in Great Britain, no coppices would be grubbed up, unle&s;s it grew on a rich &s;oil which would produce corn in&s;tead of cord|wood; con&s;equently the tanners have nothing to fear, e&s;pecially as planting hath become a prevail|ing ta&s;te among the landholders of the i&s;land. The committee appointed to prepare the bill, &s;e|riou&s;ly weighed and canva&s;&s;ed the&s;e arguments, examined di&s;puted facts, and in&s;pected papers and accounts relating to the produce, importation, and manufactory of iron.

In con&s;equence of this remon|&s;trance, a clau&s;e was added to the bill, repealing &s;o much of the act of Henry the Eighth as pro|hibited the conver&s;ion of coppice or underwoods into pa&s;ture or tillage; then it pa&s;&s;ed through both hou&s;es, and received the royal &s;anction. As there was not time, after this affair came upon the carpet, to obtain any new account from America, and as it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to know the quan|tities of iron made in that country, the hou&s;e pre|&s;ented an addre&s;s to his maje&s;ty, de&s;iring he would be plea&s;ed to give directions, that there &s;hould be laid before them, in the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, an account of the quantity of iron made in the American colonies, from Chri&s;tmas in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and forty-nine, to the fifth day of January, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-&s;ix, each year being di&s;tin|gui&s;hed.</P>
<P>From this important object, the parliament con|verted its attention to a regulation of a much more private nature.

For this purpo&s;e they were impowered to &s;end for per&s;ons, papers, and records; and it was re&s;olved that all who attended the committee &s;hould have voices. Having inquired into the cau&s;es of the late &s;carcity, they agreed to &s;everal re&s;olutions, and a bill was brought in to explain and amend the laws again&s;t regrators, fore&s;tallers, and engro&s;&s;ers of corn. The committee al&s;o re|ceived in&s;tructions to inquire into the abu&s;es of millers, mealmen, and bakers, with regard to bread, and to con&s;ider of proper methods to pre|vent them in the &s;equel; but no further progre&s;s was made in this important affair, which was the more intere&s;ting, as the lives of individuals, in a great mea&s;ure, depended upon a &s;peedy reforma|tion: for the millers and bakers were &s;aid to have adulterated their flour with common whiting, lime, bone-a&s;hes, allum, and other ingredients pernici|ous to the human con&s;titution; a con&s;ummation of villainy for which no adequate puni&s;hment could be inflicted.

By addre&s;&s;es to the king, una|nimou&s;ly voted, the commons reque&s;ted that his maje&s;ty would give directions for laying before them copies of all the letters and papers, con|taining any intelligence received by the &s;ecretaries of &s;tate, the commi&s;&s;ioners of the admiralty, or any others of his maje&s;ty's mini&s;ters, in relation to the equipment of the French fleet at Toulon, or the de&s;igns of the French on Minorca, or any other of his maje&s;ty's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Europe, &s;ince the fir&s;t day of January, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-five, to the fir&s;t day of la&s;t Au|gu&s;t.

In a word, they required the in&s;pection of all papers which could, in any man|ner, tend to explain the lo&s;s of Minorca, and the mi&s;carriage of Mr. Byng's &s;quadron. His maje&s;ty complied with every article of their reque&s;ts: the papers were pre&s;ented to the hou&s;e, ordered to lie upon the table for the peru&s;al of the members, and finally referred to the con&s;ideration of a committee of the who'e hou&s;e.</P>

Indeed many di&s;cerning per&s;ons, without doors, began to de&s;pair of &s;eeing the my&s;tery unfolded, as &s;oon as the inquiry was undertaken by a com|mittee of the whole hou&s;e. They ob&s;erved that an affair of &s;uch a dark, intricate, and &s;u&s;picious nature, ought to have been referred to a &s;elect and &s;ecret committee, cho&s;en by ballot, impowered to &s;end for per&s;ons, papers, and records; and to exa|mine witne&s;&s;es in the mo&s;t &s;olemn and deliberate manner: that the names of the committee ought to have been publi&s;hed for the &s;atisfaction of the people, who could have judged with &s;ome cer|tainty whether the inquiry would be carried on

with &s;uch impartiality as the national misfortune<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757&punc;</NOTE> required. They &s;u&s;pected that this reference to a committee of the whole hou&s;e, was a m&mdash;l con|trivance to prevent a regular and minute inve&s;ti|gation; to introduce confu&s;ion and conte&s;t; to puzzle, perplex, and ob$mbrate; to teaze, fa|tigue, and di&s;gu&s;t the inquirers, that the exami|nation might be hurried over in a &s;uperficial and perfunctory manner; and the m&mdash;y, from this anarchy and confu&s;ion of materials, half explored and undige&s;ted, derive a general parliamentary ap|probation, to which they might appeal from the accu&s;ations of the people. A &s;elect committee would have probably examined &s;ome of the clerks of the re&s;pective offices, that they might certainly know whether any letters or papers had been &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed; whether the extracts had been faithfully made; and whether there might not be papers of intelligence, which, tho' proper to be &s;ubmitted to a &s;elect and &s;ecret committee, could not con&s;i&s;tently with the honour of the nation, be communicated to a committee of the whole hou&s;e. Indeed it does not appear that the m&mdash;rs had any foreign intelli|gence or corre&s;pondents that could be much de|pended upon, in any matter of national impor|tance; and no evidence was examined on this oc|ca&s;ion: a circum&s;tance the le&s;s to be regretted, as in times pa&s;t evil mini&s;ters have generally found means to render &s;uch inquiries ineffectual; and the &s;ame arts would, at any rate, have operated with the &s;ame efficacy, had a &s;ecret committee been employed at this juncture.</P>
<P>Be that as it may, &s;everal re&s;olutions were re|ported from the committee, though &s;ome of them

<P>By the former it appeared to the committee, that his maje&s;ty, from the twenty-&s;eventh day of Au|gu&s;t, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-five, to the twentieth day of April in the &s;uc|ceeding year, received &s;uch repeated and concur|rent intelligence, as gave ju&s;t rea&s;on to believe that the French king intended to invade his domi|nions of Great Britain or Ireland.</P>
<P>In the latter they declared their opinion, that no greater number of &s;hips of war could be &s;ent into the Mediterranean, than were actually &s;ent thither under the command of admiral Byng; nor any greater reinforcement than the regiment which was &s;ent, and the detachment, equal to a battalion, which was ordered to the relief of Fort St. Philip, con&s;i&s;tently with the &s;tate of the navy, and the va|rious &s;ervices e&s;&s;ential to the &s;afety of his maje&s;ty's dominions, and the intere&s;ts of his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t have been &s;omething more powerful than ordinary conviction that &s;ugge&s;ted the&s;e opi|nions. Whatever reports might have been circu|lated by the French mini&s;try, in order to amu&s;e, intimidate, and detach the attention of the Engli&s;h government from America and the Mediterranean, where they really intended to exert them&s;elves; yet the circum&s;tances of the two nations being con|&s;idered, one would think there could have been no ju&s;t grounds to f$ar an inva&s;ion of Great Britain or Ireland, e&s;pecially when other intelligence &s;eemed to point out much more probable &s;cenes of action.

The number of &s;hips of war in actual commi&s;&s;ion, amounted to two hundred and fifty, having on board fifty thou&s;and &s;eamen and marines. Intelligence and repeated information of the French de&s;ign upon Minorca had been con|veyed to the m&mdash;y of England, about &s;ix months before it was put in execution. Is it credible, that in all this time the nation could not equip or &s;pare above eleven &s;hips of the line and &s;ix frigates, to &s;ave the important i&s;land of Minorca? Is it ea&s;y to conceive, that from a &s;tanding army of fifty thou|&s;and men, one regiment of troops could not have been detached to reinforce a garri&s;on, well known to be in&s;ufficient for the works it was de&s;tined to defend? To per&s;ons of common intellects it ap|peared, that intelligence of the armament at Tou|lon was conveyed to the admiralty as early as the month of September, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-five, with expre&s;s notice that it would con&s;i&s;t of twelve &s;hips of the line; that the de&s;ign again&s;t Minorca was communicated as early as the twenty-&s;eventh day of Augu&s;t, by con&s;ul Banks of Carthagena; confirmed by letters from con&s;ul Berttes at Genoa, dated on the &s;even|teenth and twenty-&s;ixth of January, and received by Mr. Fox, &s;ecretary of &s;tate, on the fourth and eleventh of February; as well as by many &s;ub&s;e|quent intimations; that, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e re|peated advices, even after ho&s;tilities had com|menced in Europe, when the garri&s;on of Minorca amounted to no more than four incomplete regi|ments, and one company of artillery, forty&punc;two officers being ab&s;ent, and the place otherwi&s;e

<P>Spani&s;h-town, otherwi&s;e called St. Jago de la Vega, the old capital, was an incon&s;iderable inland place of no &s;ecurity, trade, or importance; where|as King&s;ton was the center of commerce, &s;ituated on the &s;ide of a fine harbour filled with &s;hips, well &s;ecured from the in&s;ults of an enemy, large, weal|thy, and flouri&s;hing. Here the merchants dwell, and &s;hip the greate&s;t part of the &s;ugars that grow upon the i&s;land. They found it extremely incon|venient and expen&s;ive to take out their clearances at Spani&s;h-town, which &s;tands at a con&s;iderable di&s;|tance; and the &s;ame inconvenience and expence being felt by the re&s;t of the inhabitants, who had occa&s;ion to pro&s;ecute &s;uits at law, or attend the a&s;|&s;embly of the i&s;land, they joined in repre&s;entations to the governor, reque&s;ting, that, in con&s;ideration of the&s;e inconveniences, added to that of the weak|ne&s;s of Spani&s;h town and the importance of King|&s;ton, the &s;eat of government might be removed. He complied with their reque&s;t, and in &s;o doing intailed upon him&s;elf the hatred and re&s;entment of certain powerful planters, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed e&s;tates in

<P>In the two &s;e&s;&s;ions preceding this year, the affair had been brought into the hou&s;e of commons, where this governor's character was painted in frightful colours, and divers papers relating to the di&s;pute were examined. Mr. Knowles having by this time returned to England, the &s;ubject of his admini&s;tration was revived, and referred to a com|mittee of the whole hou&s;e.</P>
<P>In the mean time petitions were pre&s;ented by &s;everal merchants of London and Liverpool, con|cerned in the trade to Jamaica, alledging, that the removal of the public courts, offices, and records of the i&s;land of Jamaica to King&s;ton, and fixing the &s;eat of government there, had been productive of many important advantages, by rendering the &s;trength of the i&s;land more formidable, the pro|perty of the traders and inhabitants more &s;ecure, and the pro&s;ecution of all commercial bu&s;ine&s;s more expeditious and le&s;s expen&s;ive than formerly; therefore praying, that the purpo&s;es of the act, pa&s;&s;ed in Jamaica for that end might be carried into effectual execution, in &s;uch manner as the hou&s;e &s;hould think proper.</P>

It might be fortified at a very &s;mall expence, &s;o as to be quite &s;ecure from any attempts of the enemy, and rendered by far the mo&s;t u&s;eful harbour in the kingdom for fleets, crui&s;ers, trading &s;hips, and packet-boats, bound to and from the we&s;tward; for from hence they may put to &s;ea almo&s;t with any wind, and even at low water: they may wea|ther Scilly and Cape Clear when no ve&s;&s;el can &s;tir from the Briti&s;h channel, or out of the French ports of Bre&s;t and Rochfort; and as a po&s;t can travel from hence in three days to London, it might be|come the center of very u&s;eful &s;ea intelligence. A petition from &s;everal merchants in London, was pre|&s;ented, and recommended to the hou&s;e in a me&s;|&s;age from the king, &s;pecifying the advantages of this harbour, and the &s;mall expence at which it might be fortified; and praying that the hou&s;e would take this important &s;ubject into con&s;idera|tion.

At length, the report being made to the hou&s;e by Mr. Charles Town&s;hend, they unanimou&s;ly agreed to an addre&s;s, repre&s;enting to his maje&s;ty, that many great lo&s;&s;es had been &s;u&s;tained by the trade of the kingdom, in time of war, from the want of a &s;afe harbour on the we&s;tern coa&s;t of the i&s;land, for the reception and protection of merchant &s;hips,

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial of admiral Byng.</NOTE> Of all the tran&s;actions that di&s;tingui&s;hed this year, the mo&s;t extraordinary was the &s;entence exe|cuted on admiral Byng, the &s;on of that great officer who had acquired &s;uch honour by his naval exploits in the preceding reign, and was ennobled for his &s;ervices by the title of lord vi&s;count Torrington. His &s;econd &s;on, John Byng, had, from his earlie&s;t youth, been trained to his father's profe&s;&s;ion; and was generally e&s;teemed one of the be&s;t officers in the navy, when he embarked in that expedition to Minorca which covered his character with di&s;grace, and even expo&s;ed him to all the horrors of an igno|minious death. On the twenty-eighth day of De|cember his trial began before a court-martial, held on board of the &s;hip St. George in the harbour of Port&s;mouth, to which place Mr. Byng had been conveyed from Greenwich by a party of hor&s;e|guards, and in&s;ulted by the populace in every town and village through which he pa&s;&s;ed. The court having proceeded to examine the evidences for the crown and the pri&s;oner, from day to day, in the cour&s;e of a long &s;itting, agreed unanimou&s;ly to thir|ty &s;even re&s;olutions, implying their opinion, that
<PB N="471" REF="4860">
admiral Byng, during the engagement between the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> Briti&s;h and French fleets on the twentieth day of May la&s;t, did not do his utmo&s;t endeavour to take, &s;eize, and de&s;troy the &s;hips of the French king, which it was his duty to have engaged; and to a&s;|&s;i&s;t &s;uch of his maje&s;ty's &s;hips as were engaged, which it was his duty to have a&s;&s;i&s;ted; and that he did not exert his utmo&s;t power for the relief of St. Philip's ca&s;tle. They therefore unanimou&s;ly agreed, that he fell under part of the twelfth article of an act of parliament, pa&s;&s;ed in the twenty-&s;econd year of the pre&s;ent reign, for amending, explaining, and reducing into one act of parliament the laws re|lating to the government of his maje&s;ty's &s;hips, ve&s;&s;els, and forces by &s;ea; and as that article po&s;i|tively pre&s;cribed death, without any alternative left to the di&s;cretion of the court, under any variation of circum&s;tances, they unanimou&s;ly adjudged the &s;aid admiral John Byng to be &s;hot to death, at &s;uch time and on board of &s;uch &s;hips as the lords commi&s;|&s;ioners of the admiralty &s;hould plea&s;e to direct. But as it appeared, by the evidence of the officers that were near the admiral's per&s;on, that no back|wardne&s;s was perceiveable in him during the action, nor any mark of fear or confu&s;ion either in his countenance or behaviour; but that he delivered his orders coolly and di&s;tinctly, without &s;eeming deficient in per&s;onal courage, and from other cir|cum&s;tances, they believed his mi&s;conduct did not ari&s;e either from cowardice or di&s;affection, they una|nimou&s;ly and earne&s;tly recommended him as a pro|per object of mercy. The admiral him&s;elf behaved, through the whole trial, with the mo&s;t chearful com|po&s;ure, &s;eemingly the effect of con&s;cious innocence, upon which perhaps he too much relied. Even
<PB N="472" REF="4870">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> after he had heard the evidence examined again&s;t him, and fini&s;hed his own defence, he laid his ac|count in being honourably acquitted, and ordered his coach to be ready for conveying him directly from the tribunal to London. A gentleman, his friend, by whom he was attended, having receiv|ed intimation of the &s;entence to be pronounced, thought it his duty to prepare him for the occa&s;ion, that he might &s;ummon all his fortitude to his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance; and accordingly made him acquainted with the information he had received. The admiral gave tokens of &s;urprize and re&s;entment; but be|trayed no marks of fear or di&s;order, either then or in the court when the &s;entence was pronounced. On the contrary, while divers members of the court-martial manife&s;ted grief, anxiety, and trepidation, &s;hedding tears, and &s;ighing with extraordinary emo|tion, he heard his doom denounced without under|going the lea&s;t alteration of feature, and made a low obei&s;ance to the pre&s;ident and the other mem|bers of the court as he retired.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He is recom|mended to mercy.</NOTE> The officers that compo&s;ed this tribunal were &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the law's &s;everity, that they unanimou&s;ly &s;ub&s;cribed a letter to the board of admiralty, con|taining this remarkable paragraph: "We cannot help laying the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of our minds before your lord&s;hips on this occa&s;ion, in finding our&s;elves un|der a nece&s;&s;ity of condemning a man to death, from the great &s;everity of the twelfth article of war, part of which he falls under, which admits of no miti|gation, if the crime &s;hould be committed by an er|ror in judgment; and therefore, for our own con|&s;ciences &s;ake, as well as in ju&s;tice to the pri&s;oner, we pray your lord&s;hips, in the mo&s;t earne&s;t manner, to recommend him to his maje&s;ty's clemency." The
<PB N="473" REF="4880">
lords of the admiralty, in&s;tead of complying with<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> the reque&s;t of the court martial, tran&s;mitted their letter to the king, with copies of their proceedings, and a letter from them&s;elves to his maje&s;ty, &s;pecify|ing a doubt with regard to the legality of the &s;en|tence, as the crime of Negligence, for which the admiral had been condemned, was not expre&s;&s;ed in any part of the proceedings. At the &s;ame time co|pies of two petitions from George lord vi&s;count Torrington, in behalf of his kin&s;man admiral Byng, were &s;ubmitted to his maje&s;ty's royal wi&s;dom and determination. All the friends and relations of the unhappy convict employed and exerted their in|fluence and intere&s;t for his pardon; and as the cir|cum&s;tances had appeared &s;o &s;trong in his favour, it was &s;uppo&s;ed that the &s;ceptre of royal mercy would be extended for his pre&s;ervation: but infamous arts were u&s;ed to whet the &s;avage appetite of the popu|lace for blood. The cry of vengeance was loud throughout the land: &s;ullen clouds of &s;u&s;picion and malevolence interpo&s;ing, were &s;aid to ob&s;truct the genial beams of the be&s;t virtue that adorns the throne; and the &s;&mdash;n was given to under&s;tand, that the execution of admiral Byng was a victim ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to appea&s;e the fury of the peo|ple. His maje&s;ty, in con&s;equence of the repre&s;entati|on made by the lords of the admiralty, referred the &s;entence to the con&s;ideration of the twelve judges, who were unanimou&s;ly of opinion that the &s;entence was legal. This report being tran&s;mitted from the privy-council to the admiralty, their lord&s;hips i&s;&s;ued a warrant for executing the &s;entence of death on the twenty-eighth day of February. One gentle|man at the board, however, refu&s;ed to &s;ub&s;cribe the warrant, a&s;&s;igning, for his refu&s;al, the rea&s;ons which
<PB N="474" REF="4890">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> we have in&s;erted by way of note, for the &s;atisfac|tion of the reader <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>A&mdash;I F&mdash;s's rea&s;ons for not &s;igning the warrant for admiral Byng's execution.</P>
<P>"It may be thought great pre&s;umption in me to differ from &s;o great authority as that of the twelve judges; but when a man is called upon to &s;ign his name to an act, which is to give authority to the &s;hedding of blood, he ought to be guided by his own con&s;cience, and not by the opinions of other men.</P>
<P>In the ca&s;e before us, it is not the merit of admiral Byng that I con&s;i|der: whether he de&s;erves death, or not, is not a que&s;tion for me to de|cide; but whether or not his life can be taken away by the &s;entence pro|nounced on him by the court-martial; and after ha ing &s;o clearly ex|plained their motives for pronouncing &s;uch a &s;entence, is the point which alone has employed my mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The twelfth article of war, on which admiral Byng's &s;entence is grounded, &s;ays, (according to my under&s;tanding of its meaning) "That every per&s;on who, in time of action, &s;hall withdraw, keep back, or not come into fight, or who &s;hall not do his utmo&s;t, &amp;c. through motives of cowardice, negligence, or di&s;affection, &s;hall &s;uffer death." The court|martial does, in expre&s;s words, acquit admiral Byng of cowardice and di&s;|affection, and does not name the word Negligence. Admiral Byng does not, as I conceive, fall under the letter or de&s;cription of the twelfth article of war. It may be &s;aid, that negligence is implied, though the word is not mentioned; otherwi&s;e the court-martial would not have brought his offence under the twelfth article, having acquitted him of cowardice and di&s;affection. But it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that the negligence implied cannot be wilful negligence: for wilful negligence, in admiral Byng's &s;ituation, mu&s;t have proceeded from either cowardice or di&s;affection, and he is expre&s;ly acquitted of both the&s;e crimes: be&s;ides, the&s;e crimes, which are implied only, and not named, may indeed ju&s;tify &s;u&s;picion, and pri|vate opinion; but cannot &s;atisfy the con&s;cience in a ca&s;e of blood.</P>
<P>Admiral Byng's fate was referred to a court martial; his life and death were left to their opinions. The court-martial condemn him to death, becau&s;e, as they expre&s;ly &s;ay, they were under a nece&s;&s;ity of do|ing &s;o by rea&s;on of the letter of the law, the &s;everity of which they com|plained of, becau&s;e it admits of no mitigation. The court-martial ex|pre&s;ly &s;ay, that for the &s;ake of their con&s;ciences, as well as in ju&s;tice to the pri&s;oner, they mo&s;t earne&s;tly recommend him to his maje&s;ty for mercy; it is evident then, that in the opinions and con&s;ciences of the judges, he was not de&s;erving of death.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion then is, &s;hall the opinions, or nece&s;&s;ities, of the court-martial determine admiral Byng's fate? if it &s;hould be the latter, he will be executed contrary to the intentions and meaning of his judges; if the former, his life is not forfeited. His judges declare him not de|&s;erving of death; but, mi&s;taking either the meaning of the law, or the nature of his offence, they bring him under an article of war, which, ac|cording to their own de&s;cription of his offence, he does not, I conceive, fall under; and then they condemn him to death, becau&s;e, as they &s;ay, the law admits of no mitigation. Can a man's life be taken away by &s;uch a &s;entence? I would not willingly be mi&s;under&s;tood, and have it believed that I judge of admiral Byng's de&s;erts: that was the bu&s;ine&s;s of a court-martial, and it is my duty only to act according to my con&s;cience; which, after deliberate con&s;ideration, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the be&s;t light a poor under&s;tancing can afford, it remains &s;till in doubt, and therefore I cannot con&s;ent to &s;ign a warrant whereby the &s;entence of the court-mar|tial may be carried into execution; for I cannot help thinking, that how|ever criminal admiral Byng may be, his life is not forfeited by that &s;en|tence. I don't mean to find fault with other men's opinions: all I en|deavour at, is to give rea&s;ons for my own; and all I de&s;ire, or wi&s;h, is, that I may not be mi&s;under&s;tood; I do not pretend to judge admiral Byng's de&s;erts, nor to give any opinion on the propriety of the act.</P>

reading of the bill: accordingly, they and the re&s;t<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> of the court-martial attended, and an&s;wered all que&s;tions without he&s;itation. As they did not in|&s;i&s;t upon any excu&s;e, nor produce any &s;atisfactory rea&s;on for &s;hewing that the man they had con|demned was a proper object of mercy, their lord|&s;hips were of opinion that there was no occa&s;ion for pa&s;&s;ing any &s;uch bill, which, therefore they almo&s;t unanimou&s;ly rejected. It is not ea&s;y to conceive what &s;tronger rea&s;ons could be given for proving Mr. Byng an object of mercy than tho&s;e mentioned in the letter &s;ent to the board of admiralty, by the members of the court-martial, who were im|powered to try the imputed offence, con&s;equently mu&s;t have been deemed well qualified to judge of his conduct.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The exe|cution of admiral Byng.</NOTE> The unfortunate admiral being thus abandoned to the &s;troke of ju&s;tice, prepared him&s;elf for death with re&s;ignation and tranquility. He maintained a &s;urpri&s;ing chearfulne&s;s to the la&s;t; nor did he, from his condemnation to his execution, exhibit the lea&s;t &s;ign of impatience or apprehen&s;ion. Dur|ing that interval he had remained on board of the Monarque, a third rate &s;hip of war, anchored in the harbour of Port&s;mouth, under a &s;trong guard, in cu&s;tody of the mar&s;hal of the admiralty. On the fourteenth of March, the day fixed for his exe|cution, the boats belonging to the &s;quadron at Spithead being manned and armed, containing their captains and officers, with a detachment of marines, attended this &s;olemnity in the harbour, which was al&s;o crouded with an infinite number of other boats and ve&s;&s;els filled with &s;pectators. About noon, the admiral having taken leave of a clergy|man, and two friends who accompanied him,

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> walked out of the great cabin to the quarter&punc;deck, where two files of marines were ready to ex$cute the &s;entence. He advanced with a firm, delibe|rate &s;tep, a compo&s;ed and re&s;olute countenance, and re&s;olved to &s;uffer with his face uncovered, un|til his friends repre&s;enting that his looks would po&s;&s;ibly intimidate the &s;oldiers, and prevent their taking aim properly, he &s;ubmitted to their reque&s;t, threw his hat on the deck, kneeled on a cu&s;hion, tied one white handkerchief over his eyes, and dropped the other as a &s;ignal for his executioners, who fired a volley &s;o deci&s;ive that five balls pa&s;&s;ed through his body, and he dropped down dead in an in&s;tant. The time in which this tragedy was acted, from his walking out of the cabin to his being de|po&s;ited in the coffin, did not exceed three minutes.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Paper de|livered by him to the mar&s;hal of the admi|ralty.</NOTE> Thus fell, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of all Europe, ad|miral John Byng, who, whatever his errors and indi&s;cretions might have been, &s;eems to have been ra&s;hly condemned, meanly given up, and cruelly &s;acrificed to vile con&s;iderations. The &s;entiments of his own fate he avowed on the verge of eternity, when there was no longer any cau&s;e of di&s;&s;imulation, in the following declaration, which, immediately before his death, he delivered to the mar&s;hal of the admiralty. "A few moments will now deliver me from the virulent per&s;ecution, and fru&s;trate the further malice of my enemies. Nor need I envy them a life &s;ubject to the &s;en&s;ations my injuries, and the inju&s;tice done me, mu&s;t create; per&s;uaded I am that ju&s;tice will be done to my re|putation hereafter: the manner and cau&s;e of rai&s;ing and keeping up the popular clamour and preju|dice again&s;t me, will be &s;een through.

I heartily wi&s;h the &s;hedding my blood may contribute to the happine&s;s and &s;er|vice of my country; but cannot re&s;ign my ju&s;t claim to a faithful di&s;charge of my duty according to the be&s;t of my judgment, and the utmo&s;t exer|tion of my ability for his maje&s;ty's honour, and my country's &s;ervice. I am &s;orry that my endeavours were not attended with more &s;ucce&s;s; and that the armament, under my command, proved too weak to &s;ucceed in an expedition of &s;uch moment. Truth has prevailed over calumny and fal&s;hood, and ju&s;tice has wiped off the ignominious &s;tain of my &s;uppo&s;ed want of per&s;onal courage, and the charge of di&s;affection. My heart acquits me of the&s;e crimes: but who can be pre&s;umptuou&s;ly &s;ure of his own judgment? If my crime is an error in judg|ment, or differing in opinion from my judges, and if yet the error in judgment &s;hould be on their &s;ide, God forgive them, as I do; and may the di&s;tre&s;s of their minds, and unea&s;ine&s;s of their con&s;ciences, which in ju&s;tice to me they have repre&s;ented, be relieved and &s;ub&s;ide as my re&s;entment has done.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> the character of admiral Byng, in point of per&s;onal courage, will &s;till with many people re|main problematical. They will &s;till be of opinion, that if the &s;pirit of a Briti&s;h admiral had been pro|perly exerted, the French fleet would have been defeated, and Minorca relieved. A man's opinion of danger varies at different times, in con&s;equence of an irregular tide of animal &s;pirits, and he is actuated by con&s;iderations which he dares not avow.</P>
<P>After an officer, thus influenced, has he&s;itated or kept aloof in the hour of trial, the mind, eager for its own ju&s;tification, a&s;&s;embles, with &s;urprizing in|du&s;try, every favourable circum&s;tance of excu&s;e, and broods over them with parental partiality, until it becomes not only &s;atisfied, but even enamoured of their beauty and complexion; like a doating mo|ther, blind to the deformity of her own offspring. Whatever Mr. Byng's internal feelings might have been; whatever con&s;equences might have attended his behaviour on that occa&s;ion; as the tribunal be|fore which he was tried, acquitted him expre&s;ly of cowardice and treachery, he was, without all doubt, a proper object for royal clemency, and &s;o impartial po&s;terity will judge him, after all tho&s;e di&s;honour|able motives of faction and of fear, by which his fate was influenced, &s;hall be lo&s;t in oblivion, or re|membered with di&s;dain. The people of Great Bri|tain, naturally fierce, impatient, and clamorous, have been too much indulged, upon every petty mi&s;carriage, with trials, courts-martial, and di&s;mi&s;|&s;ions, which tend only to render their military com|manders ra&s;h and precipitate, the populace more licentious and intractable, and to di&s;grace the na|tional character in the opinion of mankind.</P>
