<STAGE>A Library. Mrs. <HI>PHOEBE LATIMER</HI> discovered at a Table with Books, reading. Enter <HI>PENELOPE,</HI> after gently tapping at the door.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>WHO'S there?&mdash;Come in, Mrs. Penelope!&mdash;Come in without ceremony.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg pardon for disturbing you, madam; but my lady ordered me to bring her a book out of the library.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>What book does Lady Paragon wish to have?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Any that comes first to hand, French or Eng|lish.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is she fond of reading poems?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>If they are moving.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>A lady's productions, I doubt, are not so apt to move, else I should recommend this collection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>A lady write poems! I wonder any lady will
<PB N="8" REF="3">
do such a thing, 'tis sure destruction to the com|plexion.&mdash;Doctor Calomel says, a lady, to preserve her beauty, should not even think; he has wrote a book purposely to dissuade people from reading.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every book he writes will do that. So far however I subscribe to his maxims, as cautiously to engage in any work of intense hot thinking, lest the fire of the imagination should force its way into the face, and the flag of the rose be made to predominate over the wreck of the lily.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, as sure as can be, that's my Lady Para|gon's reason for employing Mr. Blushenly to read to her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, so! she employs him, does she?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh yes, ma'am, Mr. Blushenly sits with my lady, and reads to her by the hour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>Humph! then depend upon it 'tis not to save her eyes that she employs Mr. Blushenly; I rather think it is to satisfy them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Blushenly is a very handsome man, to be sure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>You think so; and you are generally of your lady's way of thinking, are you not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Twould be no disparagement to my taste, if I were.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>On the contrary, Mrs. Penelope, your lady and my niece is a professed admirer of beauty, so great a one, that she admires even herself;&mdash;she may like to gratify her ears as well as her eyes by em|ploying Mr. Blushenly: so, now that we have ac|counted</P>

<BYLINE>Spoken by Mr. BANNISTER.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>THE Comic Muse, as Cyprian records prove,</L>
<L>Was Comus' daughter, by the Queen of Love,</L>
<L>A left-hand lineage&mdash;whilst the Tragic Dame</L>
<L>From legal loins of father Vulcan came;</L>
<L>Therefore <HI>this</HI> Muse loves frolic, fun, and joke,</L>
<L><HI>That</HI> bellows-blowing, blustering, puff, and smoke.</L>
<L>&mdash;Hence mother Nature's bye-begotten stock</L>
<L>Are all but chips of the old comic block;</L>
<L>For all derive their pedigrees in tail,</L>
<L>From fathers frolicsome, and mothers frail.</L>
<L>&mdash;Therefore, if in this brat of ours you trace</L>
<L>Some feature of his merry mother's face,</L>
<L>Sure, sons of Comus, sure you'll let him in</L>
<L>To your gay brotherhood, as founder's kin.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A married Muse!&mdash;no; Muses are too wis$</L>
<L>To take a poet's jointure in the skies,</L>
<L>Th' anticipation of an unborn play,</L>
<L>Or star-sown acres in the milky way:</L>
<L>So each lives single, like a cloyster'd nun,</L>
<L>But does sometimes as other nuns have done&mdash;</L>
<L><PB N="iv" REF="5">
Prays with grave authors, with the giddy prates,</L>
<L>&Ouml;r ogles a young poet thro' the grates.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Therefore our rule is, $span$ enquire,</L>
<L>Who begat whom, what $word$ or which the sire;</L>
<L>But, soon as e'er the babe $word$ thes vital air,</L>
<L>Take him, and never ask how he got there.</L>
<L>Some are still-born; some sent to mother Earth,</L>
<L>Strangled by critic midwives in their birth;</L>
<L>And many an unacknowledg'd foundling lies</L>
<L>Without a parent's hand to close its eyes:</L>
<L>Thus are our bills with deaths dramatic cramm'd,</L>
<L>And, what is worse&mdash;to die is to be damn'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>You, the Humane Society, who sit</L>
<L>To mitigate the casualties of wit,</L>
<L>Save a frail Muse's <HI>NATURAL SON</HI> from death!&mdash;</L>

<P>for two of her five senses in the interest of the reader, we need not seek for other reasons, Mrs. Penelope, why you should carry this book to the lady; and why I should interc$$$ the gentleman from fol|lowing it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>These confidential <HI>commies</HI> of the toilette are sure to talk the language of their principles. Not that I suspect my niece of an attachment&mdash;that's not her passion; vanity and variety is her game. Then the condition of poor Blushenly keeps him back; a dependant, a foundling, destitute of every thing but what the Graces have bestowed; Nature his only parent, Charity his nurse, and the wide world his in|heritance.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>BLUSHENLY,</HI> and bows.</STAGE>
<P>Mr. Blushenly, good day to you!</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blush.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your most obedient, Mrs. Phoebe; always amongst your books! ever at the toilette of the Muses!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Mr. Blushenly, my beauty-wash is cull'd from the blossoms of Parnassus; Truth holds the glass, Nature gives the grace. The mind, the mind, Mr. Blushenly, must be clothed, and here is its wardrobe; 'tis with that we attract the regards of the man of sense, with that we hold commerce with the worthy: misconstrue not my expression; the soul, young gentleman, the soul is of no sex.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="7">
<SPEAKER>Blush.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry for it, Mrs. Phoebe; for I have been apt to think all its softer attributes were of your department. Admit your doctrine to be true, and what becomes of the good old proverb, `Love begets love,' if there be no sex in the question?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>I like your proverb, I admit your proverb, I admit it in its full force, Mr. Blushenly: there is not a postulatum in philosophy I had not rather give up, than have you think for a moment that these tender attentions can be bestowed upon an unthankful heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blush.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh the vengeance! what is coming now?</P>
<STAGE>[Aside.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are not lost, believe me: not a tear that springs in your eye, not a sigh that escapes from your breast, but generates in mine a congenial affec|tion.&mdash;I appeal to what pass'd last night whilst I was at the harpsichord: you may remember the cantata was Parthenia's encouraging address to her bashful lover: I noticed the looks you gave me whilst I was singing; I felt them, you might perceive I did: they gave a meaning, an expression to the cadence: it might not reach perhaps to barbarous ears, but I am persuaded, Mr. Blushenly, it came home to your's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blush.</SPEAKER>
<P>The ears, madam, are the most dangerous avenues to the heart; your sex, as well as mine, have found them such to their cost.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>The human voice, Mr. Blushenly, was not bestowed as the mere organ of speech, but as the oral index of the soul.&mdash;You have a sweet voice, Mr. Blushenly; and what a recreation to my cars, after</P>

<P>being tortured with the crack'd untuneable trumpet of my brother, Sir Jeffery Latimer, the hoarse hunt|ing-horn of Jack Hustings, and the quarter-sessions yell of our neighbouring country squires, to hear you speak!&mdash;Thanks be to the times! these indigenio$s barbarians are in the way to be exterminated by taxes, as the Indian savages have been by rum.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blush.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, Mrs. Phoebe, your partiality puts me to the blush.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>And it becomes you; blushing becomes you: not that I approve of diffidence in excess, the least resemblance of despair; no, on the contrary, I would encourage hope, I would cherish even ambi|tion.&mdash;There is one in this family, Mr. Blushenly, warmly impressed in your favour: let not distance of condition, nor the inscrutable mysteriousness of your birth, put you out of heart; you have qualities that can counterbalance fortune; and you have a friend at hand, who bears you much good-will, more than you are aware of; more than it becomes her to express&mdash;more, perhaps, than she can express&mdash;Oh! I shall blush to death!</P>

<L>`O'er her soft cheek consenting blushes move,</L>

<P>&mdash;Thank you for your female poet! thus we women

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>How long has Lady Paragon been of that opinion?&mdash;Vexatious and perverse! <STAGE>[Aside.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her ladyship has been of that opinion long enough to change it&mdash;half an hour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought it would not be your lasting creed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah no, no, no! Woman's a riddle, my good aunt, and so is love: to love and be a woman, that's not well; to be a woman, and not love, that's worse.&mdash;Here, Blushenly, put this book in your pocket, and come and read to me whilst I dress my|self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lady Paragon, are you aware of what you say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not always; but I think I bade him come and read to me whilst I am at my toilette; by which means I divide my attentions between mind and body, and keep peace with both parties: out of two offices I think I have civilly offered him the best.&mdash;She's in a horrid humour. <STAGE>[Aside.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, niece, these may be modern man|ners: for my own part, I should think you have already bestowed pains enough upon your person for one day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady P.</SPEAKER>
<P>True; but I dress and undress myself as a child does her doll, for amusement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do you invite young gentlemen to be present on these occasions, for amusement too?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="13" REF="11">
<SPEAKER>Lady P.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I do it for his good: when he shall see what frippery a woman is made up with, what a pasticcio of gauzes, pins, and ribbons go to compound that multifarious thing a well-dress'd woman; why then&mdash;why then&mdash;what was I going to say?&mdash;he'll find that modern beauty is but haberdasher's ware; and if he ever had any gallantry (which I very much doubt) he'll be cur'd of it at once, and you may lead him up and down the house like a tame philosopher.&mdash;Isn't it so, Blushenly?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blush.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope I shall never forget myself, when I approach your ladyship or Miss Phoebe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look you there, now&punc; didn't I tell you he was fit for nothing but to air a lady's lap-dog?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>I perceive you are in one of your rallying humours, and want to be rid of me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not I, upon my life!&mdash;part not in that opinion: I talk nonsense only to drive away spleen; be assured I never was in a more melancholy mood in my life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry, niece Paragon, your father's family is so dull to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Misconceive me not; I have every thing I want but one, and without that I starve in the midst of plenty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what is that one thing wanting, pray now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Flattery: simply the food of flattery; not a full meal, that is nauseating, but evermore a $ittle relish now and then: truth is the daily bread,
<PB N="14" REF="12">
the staff of life, flattery the salt.&mdash;As for this moping mortifying thing, I can make nothing of him; a way|post has more conversation.&mdash;`I hope I shall never forget myself, when I approach your ladyship or Miss Phoebe.'&mdash;Oh, you unaccountable creature! may I be further, if he has said one flattering thing to me since in the house I have been.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blush.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor ever shall attempt it: fine men may make fine speeches, a flattering beggar only shews his mind is as mean as his condition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, if you talk sentiment to me, Blush|enly, you'll set me a crying; hands off from that edg'd tool, if you love me. Sentiment in the coun|try is clear another thing from sentiment in town: in my box at the Opera I can take it as glibly as a dish of tea, down it goes, and there's an end of it; but in walks of willows, and by the side of rivulets, there's no joke in it; I'm undone if I hear it by moon-light.&mdash;Of all things in the creation, I hate pity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did I ever hear the like? Pity is the cha|racteristic of our sex.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blush.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right, madam, it is the sister of Love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady P.</SPEAKER>
<P>W$ll, and if it is, because I take one of the family, is that a reason I should maintain all the relations?&mdash;Heaven defend me from pitying any thing above a lap-dog or a monkey!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, for a shame! would you throw that away upon a brute, which is due to your fellow|creatures?&mdash;Believe me, Mr. Blushenly, I have a
<PB N="15" REF="13">
heart for pity, and your misfortunes have a share in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady P.</SPEAKER>
<P>O lud, lud, lud! I would not pity him for the world; I would not do him such an injury; for as sure as can be, if I pitied I should love him; and if I lov'd him, all the world would pity him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blush.</SPEAKER>
<P>Envy him, you should have said: how any man belov'd by Lady Paragon can be an object of pity, is a mystery past my finding out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady P.</SPEAKER>
<P>That may well be, and no great mystery neither; as for my lovers, they are in general the merriest, gayest creatures in nature; for, as I seldom take a liking to any of them, I seldom torment 'em; but if ever that happens, wo betide 'em! no cat ever tortur'd a mouse as I persecute the poor, dear, mise|rable creature.&mdash;So, now you are fairly warn'd, Blushenly; and if you run into a trap, you run with your eyes open. <STAGE>[Lady <HI>Paragon</HI> is going, and stops at the door.]</STAGE> Well, I'm going&mdash;If you are discreet you will not go with me&mdash;but if you are determined to venture, here lies your way.&mdash;What say you? Will you venture?&mdash;Aunt Phoebe, your servant. <STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Blushenly, let me advise you&mdash;you see what a fantastical thing it is&mdash;I have something to impart to you.&mdash;Nay, if you are resolved&mdash;go&mdash;I renounce you&mdash;I commit you to your folly.&mdash;Oh! I $ould tear out her eyes! I am betrayed, abused, in|$$lted.</P>

<P>You have a notable wise head of your own, have you not?&mdash;Cackling like an old gander with but one gos|ling to your back, and then to set that fox, dropt in a bag at your door, to keep it.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what the plague's the meaning of all this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>The meaning is, that, not content with what Nature did for you, you will be a fool of your own making.&mdash;The meaning is, that you have reared, educated, father'd this <HI>Terroe-filius</HI> to bring heirs to the Latimers, children of nobody, and grandchildren without a name.</P>

<P>What would you have me do in the mat|ter?</P>

<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rank folly, Jeffery Latimer!&mdash;But I will be more moderate.&mdash;Why did you call him home
<PB N="17" REF="15">
from the University?&mdash;Why did you send him thither?&mdash;I'll argue calmly with you&mdash;Is it not enough that she has made one unhappy match?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; but I doubt that match was of our making, sister Phoebe.&mdash;Let her choose next for her|self, and she will have nobody but herself to com|plain of.</P>

<P>Now I am cool, you are hot!&mdash;How often, brother Latimer, have I talk'd to you on the subject of passion? Have not I told you that the wise an|cients call anger a short madness? You had best abuse them too, had you not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, not in your company; I have too much manners to abuse the ancients to their faces.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have no manners, Jeffery Latimer; no one component particle of a gentleman about you, but the pedigree of one: then you swear and talk so loud, and have contracted such a yell at turnpike meetings and election ordinaries, that, I protest to you, if I did not see you be-perriwig'd with the mane of a lion, I should think by your braying I was in company with an ass.</P>

<P>I wish I had the patience of an ass.&mdash;Talk of my perriwig indeed! look at your own.&mdash;What

<P>Don't be gross, Jeffery Latimer, don't be gross.&mdash;I'll not be made the butt of your ribaldry, nor the dupe of your avarice; I'll take my fortune into my own hands, and not leave it as a nest-egg to hatch cuckows of another feather than my own. You are a barren bird, brother Jeffery; your line is run out, and you are the worm at the end of it; you are the last of the Latimers, an evanescent quantity, as the schoolmen express it: you stand at the foot of a noble pedigree, like a brass farthing in a collection of rich medals.</P>

<P>That's well, that's well! fly-fishing is in season, and then my friend Jack never comes empty|handed.&mdash;But I must have a word in private with you&mdash;shut the door.&mdash;You and I, David, have kept this secret of young Blushenly, as we call him, now these twenty years and upwards; the neighbours think him a bye-brat of my own (for the old story of a foundling dropt at my door gets no credit with them), and the education I have given him, which has been such in all points as I would have given my own son, strengthens their suspicions: in all this time my cousin Frances Latimer, though she has li|berally maintain'd him in secret, has never seen him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, if report says true, she is likely to go out of the world without it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>So she does but acknowledge him at her death, be it so! My last letters out of Flanders left her in a very dangerous way.&mdash;How long ago is it, David, since my daughter's husband, Lord Paragon, died?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>A year and a half to a day, next Lammas.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Twas a happy riddance: and what the world would think a misfortune (that she had no children by him), I account a blessing; for I would fain have a grandson of my own name and family to inherit my estate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought your worship was coming to that
<PB N="20" REF="18">
point; there is no male living of the name of Latimer, unless you call Mr. Blushenly so, in right of his mother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what is he but a Latimer? Why have I brought him and Lady Paragon together, think you, but in this very hope?&mdash;I have the plea|sure to see their attachment advance every hour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>David.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can readily believe it; and a lovely couple they will be as the sun ever saw; a fine gentleman he is, and a kind-hearted and a handsome; no flouter nor fleerer at poor folks, but always humble and ob|liging: all the neighbours love him, all the poor bless him; and, for my own part&mdash;but I say little; it does not become a servant to be prating&mdash;I ask your wor|ship's pardon for my boldness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>David, you have no need to ask pardon; I consider you as a friend rather than a servant&mdash;but we'll talk of this at our leisure&mdash;Get you gone for the present; I hear Jack Hustings at the door.</P>
<STAGE><HI>[Exit</HI> David.</STAGE>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> JACK HUSTINGS.</STAGE>
<P>Ah, Jack! how runs the world with thee?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rubs as it runs. How is it, knight?&mdash;Give me thy fore-finger; I am come to rumple a napkin with thee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>And thou shalt be as welcome, my good friend, as to-day and to-morrow into the bargain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know it, I know it well, else I would not come.&mdash;I have brought thee a brace of trout, knight;
<PB N="21" REF="19">
they are the first I've taken this season, and I'll war|rant 'em as pink as a petticoat;&mdash;shew'd noble play, up the stream and down the stream:&mdash;a cloud in the sky, a ripple on the water;&mdash;here stood I; you know my old watch; snap's the word&mdash;never miss my throw.&mdash;Hast got a good breed of birds on thy manor this season?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tolerable, tolerable, a pretty fairish parcel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>So much the better; I'll come and brush the stubbles for thee in a week or two's time. I have been putting your fowling-pieces in order, for your armoury was in sad trim.&mdash;How does my dainty little widow and fair Phoebe?&mdash;I've a little matter of busi|ness for thee, if I can bring it out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's the matter now, Jack?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Burst it! I don't know what to say to it, though I came partly o' purpose to open a bit of my mind to thee, only other things put it out of my head.&mdash;By the way, don't let me forget to remind thee of Tom Trueby's election for verdurer&mdash;it comes on next Tuesday&mdash;Sir Roger's folks will be there.&mdash;Tom's an honest fellow, and of the right kidney; we shall want your voice at the poll.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here's my hand; never flinch my friends; I am staunch for Trueby.&mdash;Now go on with your bu|siness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I don't know how it is; sometimes I think I am rather lonesome of an evening, when the days are short, and the roads bad, so that my neigh|bours
<PB N="22" REF="20">
cann't visit me; then the parson's dead, and there I'm out of backgammon; books, you know, books are but dull company; a body is soon tired of reading.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly; any resource is better than that; it gives me the hip at once.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Besides, I have had a great loss amongst my greyhounds, and so, do you see&mdash;I sometimes think, by way of killing time, to take a wife; that's all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well said, Jack; and you have a mind to take fair Phoebe, as you call her; 'foregad you will have wife enough, and to spare.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, I am aware of all that; she's a bouncer, I confess: but then it is mostly in winter evenings I have occasion for such a companion; when fishing and shooting seasons set in I am gene|rally from home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>She has the vengeance of a temper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never mind that, mine will serve for both.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you broke your mind to her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, that's to come yet; I shall be a lit|tle awkward and ungain at courting, but I've a re|cipe for that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>How so, Jack?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I've got a little somewhat by heart out of a book, and can say it pretty smoothly; if I can bring her to that, I shall come tolerably well off&mdash;but I hope I shall have your good word, knight: if it is not with your liking, do you see, I am off, and no harm done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="23" REF="21">
<SPEAKER>Sir Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis a small compliment to say I had ra|ther pay her fortune to you than to a stranger, for marry she will; but as for my good word with her, I would not do you the injury to offer it.&mdash;There she is in her castle; if thou hast the heart to attack it, march up boldly, the coast is clear; but if thou thinkest it better to fortify with a good dinner, and a flask of wine, friend David shall give thee a bottle of his best, and we'll have a crash, my dear boy, to set thee on thy mettle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart, I like your counsel well; it is an old saying, `Women and wine;' but I say, wine and women.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come thy ways with me, then, and we will have a batch at backgammon, to while away the time till David gives the signal on the buttery-door.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Paragon.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, you've escaped from the bottle, but there's a worse danger in wait for you: my aunt Phoebe is out $f port, and has set all sails in full chace; ribbands $nd gauzes streaming at her top, signals of distrest $irginity on its cruise for a consort.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blush.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is there no looking-glass in this house that $ill speak a plain truth to her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="24" REF="22">
<SPEAKER>Lady P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hellebore cann't cure her: don't you know there is nothing so foolish as the follies of ge|nius, nothing so weak as the weaknesses of the wise?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blush.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly observed!&mdash;and if she will take the promissory notes of that swindler Vanity, before the solid security of honest nature, who can help it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nobody; for let Truth write ever so le|gibly, Love is blind, you know, and cann't read it: sad coufusion in the human intellects that little mis|chievous deity is apt to make; and when he aims an arrow at my aunt, he must be a sorry archer, if he does not hit so broad a mark.&mdash;After all, Harry, what do you mean to do? she is very rich.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blush.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I am very poor, but that's no proof I am very mercenary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady P.</SPEAKER>
<P>She has one strong feature in her favour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blush.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her strong box, I grant you. Your lady|ship seems to think money a tempting circumstance, and so it is in the world's opinion; but I am interest|ed to know your real sentiments; suffer me to ask, if for a moment you can put yourself in my situation, would you marry Mrs. Phoebe Latimer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Humph! that's a home question, and be|fore I answer it&punc; I must know what your situation is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blush.</SPEAKER>
<P>A thing without parents, and without a name; a waife, a stray that your father has taken up upon his manor, and keeps upon the trespass till its beggarly owner perhaps shall reclaim it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, hold, hold! you quite mistake me, you distress me;&mdash;'tis not your circumstances, Harry,
<PB N="25" REF="23">
but your affections, that my question points at; and, sure I ought to know the state of that person's heart, for whom I am called upon to answer in such a case: resolve my question, therefore, and I will reply to yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blush.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe we had better drop the subject.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady P.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means. Am I to suppose you alike indifferent to all women? that your heart is entirely disengaged?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blush.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg there may be no such supposition made.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Nay, be sincere, hide nothing from your advocate, in your own cause.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blush.</SPEAKER>
<P>Turn me not away till you are reconciled: instruct me, I beseech you, how I am to act with Mrs. Phoebe; for I am distress'd beyond measure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, then, if you are disposed for a prac|tice, I'll fight this quarter for my aunt, and you shall defend that for yourself.&mdash;Speak, are you ready?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blush.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, no; that will never do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Defend yourself, for I am coming on.&mdash;We are now alone, my dear Harry; and as I know you to be the man I may confide in, I shall not scru|ple to avow you are the man of all the world I must approve and love: a thousand opportunities have oc|curred for you to discover this, but the delicacy of your principle has determined you to meet my affec|tion with indifference; I am now resolved to prove if that indifference be real or assumed; the measure may seem out of character with strict propriety, but love on my part, and backwardness on yours, compel me to declare myself; and thus I offer you a fond, a faith|ful, a devoted heart&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blush.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stop, stop, for pity's sake! you put me out of every thing I had to say: I tell you this will never do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady P.</SPEAKER>
<P>You'll tell me of your obligations to my family; I answer, they are offices that leave us your debtors:&mdash;you'll say, you are unknown, dependant, destitute; therein you humble me, and aggrandize yourself; for, with all the nobler superiorities of na|ture

on your side, you leave me nothing but a poor advantage on the score of fortune:&mdash;as to your scru|ples that respect my father&mdash;</P>

<P>Father! you forget you are speaking for Mrs. Phoebe; you should say brother.</P>

<P>Should I?&mdash;O, Harry!&mdash;Let it pass however; and now for your answer.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blush.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot make any answer.</P>

<SPEAKER>Blush.</SPEAKER>
<P>Excuse me: I feel myself unfit to take up any other character than of the humblest of your servants, and with all respect entreat you to release me.</P>

her mind, which is wonderful to say.&mdash;Oh! she took on piteously about you in her last moments.</P>

<P>What is this you tell me? I cannot doubt but you are serious.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Fla.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not given to be a trifler, and if I were, 'twould be a sorry joke to take so long a journey for: I have the credentials sign'd and seal'd; you'll have 'em all before you, together with her last dying speech, and what she said afterwards in her will.&mdash;`Take these papers,' says she to me in her last moments, `take 'em, Major O'Flaherty, and deliver 'em into nobody's hands but my son's.'</P>

<P>With a book! yes, madam, I can take up a book, when I've nothing else to do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what books do you chiefly read, pray?&mdash;poetry, history, philosophy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>All's one for that; the Racing Calendar, Cock-fighter's Guide, Complete Angler, and the rest of the classics; nothing comes amiss.&mdash;Are you fond of fishing, Mrs. Phoebe?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>In theory extremely so; I can fish with San|nazarius all the day long.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>He's a happy man, truly; but I cannot say I know the gentleman; does he troll, pray now, or fish with a fly?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>I rather believe with a quill; Sannazarius was a poet of the fifteenth century.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that's a wonderful old age for a poet; but fishing's a long-liv'd amusement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis a solitary one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>You've hit it, Mrs. Phoebe, 'tis a solitary one; and, to say the truth, I begin to find I must seek out a companion to cheer my solitude, a companion for life, Mrs. Phoebe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh dear heart! if you are in quest of a wife, pass on; don't let me stop you; you have no time to lose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps I shall go no further.&mdash;I have a lady in my thoughts; not one of your &s;lanting young ma|dams, but a staid, sensible, discreet person, of a suit|able
<PB N="34" REF="32">
age.&mdash;I don't choose by the eye, Mrs. Phoebe; I ask for no more than I bring: youth and beauty are not indispensables in my choice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you are contented without them, you are the sooner pleased.&mdash;And who may the happy lady be, whom you have so flatteringly described?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>One you know very well, Mrs. Phoebe; she's not far off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>One of our neighbours?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>One of your family, the sister of my friend, Sir Jeffery; if you know the lady's mind, I shall be glad you will inform me of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her mind I know sure enough, but her person I should not have guess'd at by your descrip|tion of it.&mdash;I believe I may answer for that lady, that such addresses, which convey an affront, or any addresses from you, Mr. Hustings, will meet nothing but repulse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's very extraordinary; for Sir Jeffery told me you was determined of marrying out of hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did he so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes he did; `Marry she will,' says he; `and to be sure I had rather pay her fortune to you than to a stranger:' these were his very wo$ds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>Defile not my ears with the vulgar retail of his impertinent discourse. Sir Je&s;&s;ery shall repent of this insult.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, if I could but fetch her up with the speech; but, as I am a true man, she has frightened
<PB N="35" REF="33">
it out of my head.&mdash;Come, come, sweet Mrs. Phoebe, don't be angry with me; you and I have long been friends.&mdash;Fair bud of beauty! look upon your enamoured lover; suffer him to enfold you in his arms, to clasp you to his panting heart!</P>

<P>Matter enough; this savage would have forced a kiss upon me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, as I hope to be saved, I did it for the best.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you call that your best?&mdash;O fye!&mdash;Men are strange animals, and when we women throw out our charms, and look alluring, which you, dear aunt, particularly do this moment, such little fracas will happen.&mdash;Come, let me intercede; 'twas but a kiss at most, and I never think a kiss worth fighting for.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor I, perhaps, in any other case; but he had the ill-manners to introduce a proposal of mar|riage, by telling me he did not look for youth or beauty in a wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady P.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's the consequence of having too many good qualities.&mdash;Had you nothing but youth and beauty to recommend you, you had been sure to have heard of them: foolish women always get the finest things said to them.&mdash;Go your way; take no leave of her, but begone. <STAGE>[Aside to <HI>Jack.</HI></STAGE></P>

<P>Something better; but still in a terrible flutter: my heart beats vehemently.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Lady P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh yes, these men do set our hearts a beat|ing; but you see he is gone, the ravisher is gone; I hope you will recover by degrees. I'll stay by you till you are safe: if he should come back I can scream out whilst you are defending yourself; for, let the worst come to the worst, he can stop the mouth but of one of us at a time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>In my days, lovers were on their knees to their ladies for the favour of a salute; and the conces|sion of the check was not then to be obtained without long solicitation, tears, and entreaties.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Those were &s;ine days indeed; then a lady set her favours at some price: now so many give away

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady P.</SPEAKER>
<P>The tapestry bed-chamber, when you was shewing him king Solomon and his concubines in chain-stitch.&mdash;Defend me from these modest men! your beef-fed country squires are nothing to them; they have the will, indeed, but not the wit to be mis|chievous.</P>

<P>Well, well, I sha'n't easily be persuaded out of my good opinion of Mr. Blushenly.</P>

<STAGE>A Hunting-Hall. Sir <HI>JEFFERY LATIMER, BLUSH|ENLY,</HI> and <HI>O'FLAHERTY.</HI> A Table with Papers.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jeffery.</SPEAKER>
<P>JOY to you, my dear Harry, all joy attend you!&mdash;The will's a good will; you have a brave property&punc;
<PB N="38" REF="36">
your title's firm, pen and parchment cann't make a better. Iam beside myself with joy; I'll have a jubilee for this month to come; there sha'n't be a sober man in the county. I could laugh and cry, and be merry and be sad, or any thing but in my senses.&mdash;Come into my arms, my dear, dear Mr.&mdash;What's your name?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Fla.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dennis O'Flaherty is my name. I hope you like it; it has been a pretty while in the family, and I should be loth to change it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall love your name and your nation as long as $ have breath. Why, a man of your parts might have married this cousin of mine, and snapped her whole fortune, if you had not been the noblest fellow upon earth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Fla.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where's the nobleness of not being a ra$cal? I prize the friendship of the fair sex too well to raise money upon them. It was my fortune in life to in|herit nothing at all; and I have not lessened it: my good name and my good sword are still my own, and there is no incumbrance upon either; I have not mortgaged them to dishonour, and, with the grace of Heaven, I never intend it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blush.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. O'Flaherty, I would fain thank you; but my heart is too full; time and my future conduct must declare my gratitude: whatever may be my good fortune, you, under Providence, are the father of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Fla.</SPEAKER>
<P>It has been my lot, young gentleman, to meet a great deal of good fortune in the world&mdash;be|longing
<PB N="39" REF="37">
to other people, I mean&mdash;and 'tis a mighty pleasant thing to carry up and down, though I have never kept any to my own share.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, my good friend, 'tis well my cousin Frances fell into honest hands; she was a tempting trust in a distant country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Fla.</SPEAKER>
<P>What difference does the distance make in my honesty, or her trust? Not but I must own some of your countrymen, who have had their tempting trusts at a distance, have remembered to leave the trust behind 'em, and bring home nothing but the temptation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true, that's true. Oh! that you had heard what a speech I had like to have made one day in parliament on this very subject.&mdash;`Mr. Speaker,' says I, starting on my legs, <Q>&startq;shall I tamely sit down? shall I sit down tamely, Mr. Speaker?&endq;</Q> Would you think it?&mdash;passion choked me, and I did sit down.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Fla.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a pity's that, when a man has got a full bottle, and cann't pluck out the cork!&mdash;I'll tell you what, Sir Jeffery, you need not be surprised at finding a poor catholic, like myself, an honest man; you take a ready way to keep us so, by shutting us out of your service.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>And now, Harry, that you are of the house of the Latimers, if it drops in your hands I am clear of the blame.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Fla.</SPEAKER>
<P>O' my conscience, that's well thought of; if there's a gap in your pedigree, old gentleman, you
<PB N="40" REF="38">
ha$ better trust to him for filling it up than yourself; aye, and let me tell you, you are not a little beholden to the poor dear soul that's dead, for putting a $treak in your ladder, when you was on the last step of it: marry! but she made a good job of it, though she had only her left hand to work with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blush.</SPEAKER>
<P>Touch not upon that subject! I am to mourn a mother, who, till the last hour of her life, never acknowledged me; I must remember her, therefore, as a benefactress rather than a parent.&mdash;You, sir, have ever been a father to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Take my daughter into council then, and be a son to me. You see the conditions of your mo|ther's bequest; unless you marry Lady Paragon you have only a life-holding in your estate: Frances, with all her failings, had a family-feeling for the house of Latimer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blush.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis that condition, with other reasons of equal delicacy, makes me entreat you both to keep this matter a secret, till I have sounded the affections of your adorable daughter. I would owe my happi|ness to nothing but her free choice and bounty&mdash;I be|seech you, therefore, to conceal this event, for a few hours at least, from Lady Paragon, from Mrs. Phoebe, and in short, from all your family, but ho|nest David; his friendly anxiety must be relieved. You will promise me this, Sir Jeffery?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Twenty long years and upwards have I brooded upon this nest-egg, and now the chicken's hatcht I mayn't cackle;&mdash;'tis a little hard, but I'll do as you bid me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="41" REF="39">
<SPEAKER>Blush.</SPEAKER>
<P>Major O'Flaherty, I may expect the same from you?</P>

<P>To be sure you may, my dear:&mdash;amuse yourself in your own way, ride your own round|about, so you do but come to the right point at last.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, Harry, this business being dis|patched, let us now go and tap the best bottle in my cellar to the health of this worthy gentleman, to whose good offices we are both so highly indebted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Fla.</SPEAKER>
<P>For the bottle, Sir Jeffery, I am your man; for the good offices you speak of, speak no more about 'em; honesty is due to every man, and how should you be indebted to me for what I owe you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>By no means&mdash;I am at home;&mdash;but not Latimer, if you please, call me Blushenly.</P>

<P>I'll be his sponsor, though it were in the dark.&mdash;And now, friend Jack, shall we drink to the health of fair Phoebe, your future bride?</P>

<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hush, hush! if you love me; no more of that, knight: let the wind whistle as it may, if every month in the twelve was November, I'll tuck myself up with a halter, before I'll couple with a wife.</P>

<P>Is there any quarrel a-foot? What is the matter, may I ask?</P>

<P>A lady's matter; a small suit at matrimony
<PB N="43" REF="41">
between this worthy gentleman and a maiden sister of mine, Mrs. Phoebe Latimer: the good lady, it must be owned, is rather on the down-hill passage towards the vale of years, and has cast the eyes of her affection on the young gentleman we just now parted with.</P>

<P>Casualty-compiler, an' please you, inven|ter of murders to amuse our customers; but they said I wanted variety in my violent deaths, I made too much use of the brewer's dray; so they took a tragic poet in my place, and I was turned into West|minster Abbey, as valet-de-chambre to the ragged regiment, to brush the dust off the faces of the wax|work; from thence I came into Squire Ruefull's ser|vice; and if I take another step downwards, it must be to the old one, for I can go no lower in this world.</P>

<P>Warmly to promote it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you take a very extraordinary method of doing it, let me tell you:&mdash;I can hardly believe Lady Paragon will be the more disposed to give her hand to Mr. Latimer, for the ardor with which Mr. Blushenly kisses it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blush.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, madam, perhaps I cannot defend every little inattention to prudence; you must take me on the tenor of my life; and I trust it will never happen to me to be found wanting in esteem for you: as to Lady Paragon, be assured, I will never oppose the presumptuous addresses of a Foundling, to the just pretensions of a man of fortune.</P>

<P>Ah, Mrs. Phoebe! a pretty many years have gone over our heads since I handed you to your ber|lin from the opera of Griselda. I was then a young man just come home from my travels, and you a fine gay girl in your bloom, just setting out in your career of conquests.&mdash;By the same token, I remember I broke a glass hoop-ring, which it was then a fashion to wear, into your finger by squeezing your hand; I shall never forget the pretty flutter it threw you into, when the blood started through your glove: I penn'd a sonnet on the occasion, in elegiac metre, that had some points in it; but it did not move; you was ever inexorable.</P>

<P>Very likely, for I dare say your wound healed quicker than mine.&mdash;I retired from the gay world soon after, where I had no desire to pass for a sple|netic companion amongst men of pleasure; since when I have made some friendships with the dead, merely that we may not be absolute strangers to each other when we meet; however, I have this advantage in it, that I am going to my connections, and you are part|ing from yours. Not that I would be understood to insinuate that you have any symptoms of immediate decay about you, Mrs. Phoebe; on the contrary, I think your air and apparel more gay and juvenile than

<SPEAKER>Rue.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is something very sincere in your chal|lenge, young lady, I like the manner of it well; and, to tell you the truth, I came hither purposely to see you; for though I am an old fellow with one foot in my coffin, I hope there's no harm if I take a parting peep at youth and beauty before death shuts down the lid. I was curious, you must know, to see you with my own eyes, and hear with my own ears; for had I taken what that idle young fellow reported upon
<PB N="63" REF="61">
trust, I should have the strangest opinion of you in nature.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rue.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's a fair confession at least; and if it does not serve to convey a very favourable impression of your judgment, it enables me to guess at your af|fections towards the young man at your elbow: and I am persuaded I shall have my old friend Mrs. Phoebe on my side, if I wish you both happy in each other.</P>

<P>Then their ages, madam&mdash;there, I'm sure, you'll own they're match'd.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rue.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whether I am officious or not, madam, time must shew; but I trust there is no offence in saying, that if this young lady was my daughter, I would bestow her on Mr. Blushenly; or was he my son, I would recommend him to Lady Paragon: this is my opinion, Mrs. Phoebe, and I am ready to back it with my purse, if it is wanted. I believe I have as good an estate as my old friend here, perhaps I might say a better, for I have nursed it pretty care|fully, and lived upon the gnawing of a crust;&mdash;'twas my humour, and I had nobody's leave to ask for mor|tifying myself.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blush.</SPEAKER>
<P>I were a brute without reason could I so judge of you. The playfulness of your spirit shews the purity of your nature; a heart like yours would make an angel's face superfluous; I think with too much reverence of your virtue to recollect that you are beautiful.</P>

<P>Do you propose this in ridicule, or in insult to me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Fla.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, if it shocks the delicacy of your na|ture, away with it at once; and, to say the truth, I was afraid your modesty could not put up with it.&mdash;What will become of her reputation? says I to Mr. Latimer. Would you put a fair innocent creature side by side with a tempting young rogue in a close
<PB N="71" REF="69">
carriage? I'm ashamed of you, says I.&mdash;Oh! I rattled him off roundly, for dreaming of it; for I was of your way of thinking, that it would be best to knock him on the head at once, and save mischief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>Murder to save mischief!&mdash;Murder my reputation rather! inclose me in the odious post&punc;chaise! let my innocence be your sacrifice, sooner than meditate an act so horrible: if no means else can be devised to separate him from Lady Paragon, be|hold me ready to devote myself a voluntary victim to preserve the honour and the interests of my family!</P>

<P>Miser enough I own he is, and has gone near to starve me; but then he starves himself, so I cann't complain of him for that: a man-hater he is, I don't deny it; but then he does good to people out of spite.&mdash;He can be charitable enough, whilst other folks take the praise of it; find him out, and you are sure to lose his good-will.&mdash;He was a rake in his young days.</P>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>There's a lady of family (I don't know who she is) that he behaved very ill to: it lies on his con|science, and has turned his temper to vinegar:&mdash;she had a child by him&mdash;when he went abroad and left

<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>A moment's patience!&mdash;Mr. Ruefull, give me your hand; nay, good sir, give it me!&mdash;I ho|nour you from my soul:&mdash;I beg pardon for the false opinion I have had of you;&mdash;I am a country|bred fellow, 'tis true, but I have an honest heart, and a warm one&mdash;so Heaven bless you! that's enough.</P>

<SPEAKER>Rue.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ahem!&mdash;What's the matter with my eyes?&mdash;A plague upon the fellow, say I, for putting me in humour with&punc;mankind.&mdash;Go on with your story&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>I educated him in all points as my own son.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rue.</SPEAKER>
<P>And at your own expence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I was privately supplied by his mother for that purpose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rue.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank you, sir! thank you heartily for that; I should else have been compelled to confess it was a benevolent action.&mdash;And who is his mother?&mdash;Stop, though! if it is one of your secrets, keep it to your|self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>It has been a secret, an inviolable secret, from the day of his birth to this hour;&mdash;it is now no
<PB N="77" REF="75">
longer so; for the death of his mother, who was a kinswoman of mine&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rue.</SPEAKER>
<P>How's that? what do you say? a kinswoman of yours!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>A near one; my cousin, Frances La|timer&mdash;</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rue.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>What alarms you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rue.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is Blushenly the son of Mrs. Fanny La|timer? are you sure of this? have you no trick in it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Trick! you may see her will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rue.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shew it to me.&mdash;Had she no other son, no other child but this? answer me this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>No other child.&mdash;After putting him into my hands, she left England, shut herself into a con|vent at Lisle in Flanders, and led an exemplary life in retirement from the world, though she would never be induced to acknowledge her son, or discover his father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rue.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me see the will, let me see the will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come into my closet with me, and you shall see it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rue.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shew me the way.&mdash;Hey-day! what ails me? how my head swims!&mdash;Give me your arm.&mdash;So, so! 'tis better.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bear up, my good friend; I see you are agitated by this discovery.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady P.</SPEAKER>
<P>A situation of more hazard than mine could not well be; for I was courted by my ad|mirers, and neglected by my husband. Oh! let no woman wed a gamester! human misery cannot ex|ceed it.&mdash;And now, my dear Harry, that I have given you a portrait of myself, the best I can say for it is, that it is a faithful likeness; some faulty tints there may be, which the pencil of vanity has thrown in, but they will fly off in time; and I flatter myself it is no where dashed with the dark shades of guilt or deformity: as for the colours which love has given it, they will never fade in your keeping, for they are burnt in with fire, and can only perish with the piece itself. <STAGE>[They embrace.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter Mrs. <HI>PHOEBE LATIMER,</HI> as they are embracing.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can support this no longer.&mdash;Mr. Blush|enly, you are a traitor! Lady Paragon, you are&mdash;I won't say what&mdash;I renounce you!</P>

<SPEAKER>Blush.</SPEAKER>
<P>Recollect yourself, madam! speak without passion, and I will answer you without reproach.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, sir, I will not speak without passion, nor will I enter upon any explanation with you.&mdash;There is a couching lion in your path, ready to spring upon you, and devour you both: an awful secret is in my keeping, nature extorts it from me; and be|fore you rush into the crime of incest, know, young man&mdash;and tremble whilst I tell it&mdash;you are her fa|ther's
<PB N="79" REF="77">
son.&mdash;How now! have you no feeling to your situation, that you receive it thus calmly? If you can doubt it, $'ll produce my brother, and he shall con|firm it to your faces.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stay, madam, if you please; there is no occasion to spread our family disgrace any further.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>How you both stand!&mdash;Lady Paragon, I'm astonished at your insensibility: you don't even change colour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady P.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's much indeed; for I'm very apt to blush for those who assert a falsehood to my face.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>A falsehood! what do you insinuate?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blush.</SPEAKER>
<P>Patience, I beseech you, and let us save you whilst we can.&mdash;Your zeal for Mr. Latimer hur|ries you too far, when it puts you to invention and the abuse of truth.&mdash;In some degree I take the fault upon myself; for I could sooner have told you that his interest in this lady's affections stands on the se|curity of honour, and does not want the aid of fic|tion&mdash;I am that happy man! I am that Latimer!</P>

<P>No, my dear aunt, you shall not sink; we are your friends, and we will hold you up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>Impossible! I never can recall what I've said.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="80" REF="78">
<SPEAKER>Blush.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor shall you; for if time shall ever extin|guish in your breast its partial affection for Blushenly, gratitude shall continue to record it in the heart of Latimer: therefore I pray you be at peace with your|self. What now is done, is done in secret; and who|ever, in my hearing, dares to vent a sneer at the aunt of my Louisa, makes an enemy of me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoebe.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you; you both are truly generous;&mdash;but I am much agitated, and wish to retire to my chamber.</P>

<P>Stop, my good friend!&mdash;and, before a word can pass your lips, let me exact from you, as a soldier and a man of honour, to look at these ladies, and if there be here present one, to whose thoughts in some weak moment (for we all have such moments) you have been privy, bury them in generous silence for ever, and approve yourself deserving of the favours of the sex, by your gallantry in concealing their foibles!</P>

<SPEAKER>O'Fla.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand you, sir, perfectly; and when I pledge my honour, I pledge that which neither to

<P>You might have died, if we had not opened a vein.</P>

<P>Might have died!&mdash;well, and what might I do better? I have always reckoned upon one happy hour in life&mdash;the hour at the end of it.&mdash;Hark ye, Sir Jeffery, ask your daughter if she resolves upon marrying that young man by her side.</P>

<SPEAKER>Rue.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, madam, let me ask you why you make this choice?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because I know him, love him, and ad|mire him; his honour, gentleness, modesty, and be|nevolence, endear him $o me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rue</SPEAKER>
<P>And is this a world for such a man to live in? With all these qualities, what sort of figure will he make in high life?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady P.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should be sorry if a man of your good sense gave into hackneyed invectives against high life; I suspect it is the vices of the vulgar which are precipitating this country to its grave!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rue.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be so; I stand corrected. But it is fitting you should know there is one objection to your future husband: he is the son of a humoursome, capricious old fellow, whom all the world sets down for a sna$ler and a miser.&mdash;I am his father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>There, there! <STAGE>[Blesses him.]</STAGE>&mdash;I do these of|fices scurvily; a fellow of no feeling would make you a fine speech on the occasion.&mdash;I desire there may be no more said of the matter; it won't tell to my re|putation&mdash;Old Jeffery knows all about it.&mdash;The world was a bad world, even in my young days, and I con|tributed to make it worse: I used your mother like a

rascal, the more shame for me! She never forgave it, and I never ceased repenting of it: if she would have told me where to find you, you should not have been so long without a father.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Fla.</SPEAKER>
<P>O <HI>Jubilate!</HI> what a hurricane of good luck is fallen upon us.&mdash;Hark ye, Mr. Jack Hustings, you and I will make the corks crack for this.</P>

<P>Happy be your lot, young lady! May the son repair the injuries of the father! and, by the ho|nour of his conduct to your family, atone for the shame which mine has brought upon it!</P>

<P>I am only afraid he is too rich to be virtuous; if I was to consult his true interest I should disinherit him.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blush.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fear me not, sir, whilst there is an honest man in this company in want of that which we abound in.&mdash;Captain O'Flaherty, I hold myself accountable for Lady Paragon's debts; they are gaming debts indeed, but no less debts of honour: she has lost a wager to you of a wedding&punc;favour&mdash;It is not very ele|gantly made up, but it is cordially bestowed&mdash;I hope you'll wear it for her sake. <STAGE>[Gives a paper folded up.</STAGE></P>
