<HEAD>CHAPTER XXII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A&s;cent to the Glaciers.&mdash;Mountain-Pro&s;pects.&mdash;Hymn
written among the Alps.</HEAD>
<P>FROM a little village &s;ituated at the
foot of the Glaciers, and near the &s;ource
of the Rhine, we departed early the
next morning to &s;cale the mountain that
led us to that mighty &s;tore-hou&s;e of
winter. Our road lay along the &s;ide of
a torrent, part of which is applied to the
purpo&s;e of turning the mill belonging to
the hamlet, and watering the little en|clo&s;ures
around it. A path-way had been
<PB N="2" REF="9">
formed by the people acro&s;s the Glaciers,
in order to communicate with the in|habitants
of the upper part of the valley
of Ragantz.</P>
<P>The mountain, like tho&s;e we had ju&s;t
left in the middle region, on the &s;outhern
&s;ide of St. Bernardin, produced a fine
&s;hort gra&s;s; and the pea&s;ants were &s;pread|ing
as we pa&s;&s;ed their &s;cented harve&s;t,
to the plea&s;ant, but fleeting &s;un-beam,
eager to improve the precarious ble&s;sing,
and &s;natch the golden moments! Along
a fine amphitheatre of mountains, we
&s;pied the inhabitants of the various cot|tages
at this pa&s;toral employment, hang|ing
on the &s;teeps like goats, to turn the
&s;wath, and leaving us to wonder by what
ingenuity the gra&s;s was fir&s;t mowed.
The&s;e <HI>chalets,</HI> or mountain cabins, are
fitted for the region where they are
placed, though of an order of architecture
<PB N="3" REF="10">
of which Palladio gives no de&s;cription.
They are in general built with the wood
of the pine, or the larch, but when not in
the neighbourhood of fore&s;ts, are erected
with &s;tone. To mo&s;t of the chalets the
mountain it&s;elf affords one &s;ide ready con|&s;tructed,
as they are u&s;ually placed in
&s;uch &s;ituations that when the avalanche
rolls from the top, it &s;hall find no re|&s;i&s;tance
from tho&s;e habitations, &s;hielded
by the friendly hill that ri&s;es abrupt be|hind,
but pa&s;sing harmle&s;s over the &s;hel|tered
dwelling, fling at a &s;afe di&s;tance its
de&s;tructive ma&s;s.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t of the&s;e chalets we &s;topped
to repo&s;e our&s;elves, though we had halted
&s;o often to botanize, as the hills abounded
in a rich variety of herbs and delicate
mountain-flowers, that we had hitherto
&s;uffered little from the labor of the
a&s;cent; but our ramble, together with the
<PB N="4" REF="11">
morning breeze of the mountains, had
created no u&s;ual appetite; and we &s;at
down to a repa&s;t or dried fruits, and
coffee, before the door of the chalet, to
prepare us for the remainder of our enter|prize.</P>
<P>The a&s;cent to the Glaciers on the
oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the valley appeared &s;o
romantic, that we regretted for a mo|ment
that we had not taken a route,
which &s;eemed not only plea&s;anter, but
&s;horter; our mountain companions, how|ever,
&s;ilenced our murmurs by a&s;&s;uring us
that every &s;tep we took, though appa|rently
leading us further from the oppo|&s;ite
mountain, would at length bring us
nearer. We had been &s;o often deceived
in our ideas of di&s;tances in the Alps,
which it requires long u&s;age and a moun|tain-eye
to calculate accurately, that we
gave up our rea&s;on to the care of the&s;e
<PB N="5" REF="12">
Gri&s;ons, per&s;uaded that &s;ome mountain-miracle
would be wrought in our favor.</P>
<P>The latter part of our journey was ex|treme
toil; at &s;ome di&s;tance from the
top, the mule which had hitherto carried
me was left tied to a rock, and our guides
&s;upported me up the rugged &s;teep; my
fellow travellers, who were furni&s;hed with
crampons, little machines buckled to the
feet, with points to enable the wearer to
keep his hold, purcha&s;ed their &s;ecurity
by exce&s;sive fatigue from wearing them.</P>
<P>We were frequently overcome by the
extreme heat, as well as by the difficulty
of the path, and often &s;topped to cool our
fever at the torrent which we &s;aw bur&s;t|ing
above, from its icy &s;ource. No in|convenience,
we were told, re&s;ulted from
taking this cooling draught; though far
from being convinced of the truth of this
<PB N="6" REF="13">
a&s;&s;ertion, we were glad to find an excu&s;e
in the example of our Gri&s;on companions,
for quaffing this delicious beverage; and,
like our fir&s;t parent, &startq;when not deceiv'd,
but fondly overcome,&endq; he ta&s;ted &startq;of that
fair, enticing fruit,&endq; &s;o we, again&s;t our
better knowledge, &s;crupled not to drink
large libations of this tempting nectarious
water.</P>
<P>With an inexpre&s;sible &s;en&s;ation of
fatigue like the giddine&s;s of delirium,
breathle&s;s, and burning with heat, we
threw our&s;elves, &s;ome time after mid-day,
on the gra&s;s, along the icy boundary,
from who&s;e ba&s;e ru&s;hed the torrent
whence we gathered the icicles that
again &s;lackened our exce&s;sive thir&s;t.
The&s;e feelings of parched heat were not
the effects of fatigue; we had taken as
violent exerci&s;e beneath the hot noon|tide
rays in the Italian vallies, with le&s;s
<PB N="7" REF="14">
feveri&s;h &s;en&s;ations than we now expe|rienced
in tho&s;e regions of winter. After
a &s;light interval of repo&s;e, however, we
found our&s;elves re&s;tored to that feeling of
&s;erene, tranquil delight, for which the
philo&s;ophers who have written on the
theory of the Higher Alps, account, from
the purity of the atmo&s;phere at that im|men&s;e
elevation; and which &s;tate of
&s;oothing happine&s;s Rou&s;&s;eau has de&s;cribed
with his u&s;ual eloquence, in a letter to
Julia<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The general impre&s;&s;ion felt by tho&s;e who &s;cale the higher mountains, where the air is pure and &s;ubtile, is a greater ea&s;ine&s;s in breathing, more light|ne&s;s in the body, and more &s;erenity in the mind.&mdash;Meditation a&s;&s;umes, in tho&s;e regions, &s;omething of a character great, and &s;ublime, proportioned to the objects which &s;trike us; &s;omething of tranquil rapture, remote from all that is &s;elfi&s;h, or &s;en&s;ual. It &s;eems as if, while rai&s;ed above the haunts of men, we leave below all mean and earthly &s;entiments, and that, as we approach the etherial regions, the &s;oul contracts &s;ome|thing of their unchangeable purity. Upon the whole, this &s;pectacle has &s;omething in it of magic and &s;uper|natural, which overwhelms the mind and &s;en&s;es; we forget every thing, we forget our&s;elves, and have &s;carcely a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of exi&s;tence.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="15">
While my fellow travellers amu&s;ed
them&s;elves by wandering over that world
of ice, a difficult and dangerous enter|prize,
I &s;at down on the border of the
Glacier, to enjoy the new and magnificent
vi&s;ion around me. On the right, rocks
and mountains of ice, aro&s;e in dread
and &s;ublime per&s;pective; before me, St.
Bernardin lifted its barren and un|covered
top; and nearly in the &s;ame di|rection,
the eye wanders over a chain of
Glaciers which &s;eparates the valley of the
Rhine from the &s;ubject countries of the
Gri&s;ons, Bormeo, and the Valteline. The&s;e
were the Glaciers which, mid-way, we
regretted not having &s;caled, and which
our guides told us we &s;hould reach &s;ooner
<PB N="9" REF="16">
in the direction we had already taken.
So far as we might tru&s;t to the te&s;timony
of our &s;en&s;es, they were not mi&s;taken.
The&s;e Glaciers appeared to touch that on
which we were now placed; and it
&s;eemed as if we had only to de&s;cend a
little from our pre&s;ent elevation, in order
to climb the &s;avage and naked pyramids
of rocks which rai&s;ed them&s;elves up from
the far-&s;pread de&s;ert of ice, like barren
i&s;lands from a troubled &s;ea. We were,
however, &s;eparated from tho&s;e objects by
a &s;pace of &s;everal miles, mea&s;ured on the
ground; but the intervening gulph was
hid from our &s;ight by the &s;well of the
mountains. On the left, the eye was
borne over the amphitheatre of hills,
green with pa&s;turage, up to the ridge of
ice, &s;tretching along its own &s;ullen, and
perhaps incroaching boundary. The cattle
were cropping the herbage on the &s;teep,
and the chamois bounding over the rocks,
<PB N="10" REF="17">
for &s;uch the Gri&s;on-pea&s;ant told me
were a few playful animals I per|ceived
at a great di&s;tance at the edge
of the Glacier, over which my fellow-travellers
were wandering. I employed
the hours of meditation in throwing to|gether
the new images with which the
Alpine &s;cenery had filled my mind,
into the form of an hymn, to the au|thor
of nature; and no &s;pot can &s;urely
be more congenial to devotional feel|ings,
than that theatre where the divi|nity
has di&s;played the mo&s;t &s;tupendous
of his earthly works.</P>
<P>The lengthening &s;hadow of the icy-wall
at the foot of which I was &s;it|ting,
drew me from my meditations,
and I began to be &s;eriou&s;ly alarmed at
the ab&s;ence of my friends. The oppo|&s;ite
Glaciers were now lighted up with
that glowing ro&s;e-coloured hue, with
<PB N="11" REF="18">
which they are tinged at parting day.
I gazed with rapture on this glorious
vi&s;ion, which I had before &s;een at an
immen&s;e di&s;tance, and with feeble im|pre&s;sions
compared to the enthu&s;ia&s;tic,
the &s;olemn emotion I now experienced.
The clouds were rolling high above
the valley, but remotely beneath the
&s;pot where I &s;tood, in gorgeou&s;ly co|loured
billows, as their upper &s;urfaces
were tinged by the la&s;t rays of the
&s;un.</P>
<P>While I was contemplating the&s;e ma|je&s;tic
images, my fellow-travellers hailed
us from a di&s;tant part of the moun|tain,
to which they had de&s;cended
from the Glacier. There was no time
left to li&s;ten to their
<Q><L>&startq;Travels hi&s;tory,</L>
<L>Of Anters va&s;t, and de&s;erts idle,</L>
<L>Rough quarries, rocks, and hills, who&s;e heads touch
heaven,&endq;</L></Q>
<PB N="12" REF="19">
all which I &s;hould have been very
&s;eriou&s;ly inclined to hear, if our guides
had not reminded us, that though the
tops of the mountains where we &s;tood
were &s;till rejoicing in the light of day,
darkne&s;s already brooded over the face
of the vallies.</P>
<P>The vapours gathered thicker as the
evening advanced; and from the brow
of the fir&s;t &s;lope where we de&s;cended,
we pau&s;ed a moment to &s;natch a nearer
view of the tumultuous &s;welling tide
of clouds into which we were about
to plunge, rolling in &s;ilent but awful
di&s;cordance along the valley, between
the maje&s;tic &s;treights of the Glaciers.</P>
<P>We had &s;carcely gained the &s;pot
where we left our mule, before the
&s;un had taken his la&s;t leave of the
pointed rocks on the oppo&s;ite Glacier,
<PB N="13" REF="20">
and night &s;eemed ri&s;ing from the valley.
We found the bridle in the place where
we had tied it to the rock, but the
mule, in who&s;e reputation for patience
we had placed too much confidence,
or who had formed a better judgment
of the fit hour of retreat than our|&s;elves,
had withdrawn his head, and ab|&s;conded.
I had rather been borne,
than &s;upported to this &s;pot, between two
of our guides; a mode of conveyance
which was both di&s;agreeable and incon|venient.
To walk down to the valley
was for me impo&s;sible, to look for the
mule along the mountains would have
been a vain attempt, and to have &s;ought
another from below, would have de|layed
our return 'till midnight. In this
perplexity, one of our Gri&s;on-guides,
who had rambled a few paces in &s;earch
of the animal, returned with his arms
full of &s;hrubs, which he placed in two
<PB N="14" REF="21">
leathern girdles fa&s;tened to the long
poles that are the walking &s;ticks of the
Glaciers, and tied them together, &s;o as
to form a &s;ort of chair, or litter; on
this I placed my&s;elf, not without &s;ome
apprehen&s;ion, but was carried in perfect
&s;afety down to the cottage where we
had breakfa&s;ted in the morning, and
where we found our mule, who had
been caught marching homewards early
in the evening, and detained by the
cottagers till our return.</P>
<P>The hours till midnight were filled
up by my fellow-travellers, with ac|counts
of their wonderful vi&s;ions. I
made a number of notes of what I
had my&s;elf &s;een, and heard of the
Glaciers; but after reading the glowing
de&s;cription given of tho&s;e &s;tupendous
phoenomena, by Mr. Ramond, in his
elegant tran&s;lation of Mr. Coxe's fir&s;t
<PB N="15" REF="22">
edition of his travels, I determined, in|&s;tead
of pre&s;umptuou&s;ly intruding my
own imperfect ob&s;ervations, or intelli|gence,
to &s;eize this occa&s;ion of intro|ducing
that fini&s;hed e&s;&s;ay to the Eng|li&s;h

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Source of the Rhine.&mdash;Valley of the Rhine.&mdash;Splugen.&mdash;
Valley of Schams.&mdash;Via Mala.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE we bid adieu to the Alpine
regions, we went up the valley to vi&s;it
the &s;pot from whence the Rhine draws its
fir&s;t and principal &s;ource, at the foot of
the Glacier which we had vi&s;ited the
preceding day, but &s;ome miles nearer the
ma&s;s of mountains of which that Glacier
is a branch. There are three &s;ources to
this celebrated river; one, called the
Lower Rhine, ri&s;es from that part of the
mountain of St. Gothard which &s;tretches
behind the valley of Ur&s;cren, and flows
along the Gri&s;on valley of Tavel&s;ch: the
middle &s;ource &s;prings from the we&s;tern
extremity of the Glacier of the Vogels|berg,
and flowing through the valley of
Medels, joins the former, at the di&s;tance
<PB N="21" REF="28">
of &s;ome leagues, near the Abbey of
Di&s;entis; the Higher Rhine, which is
&s;aid to have been the only branch known
to the Antients, proceeding from the ma&s;s
of mountains formerly called the Adula,
runs from the ea&s;tern extremity of the
Vogel&s;berg, or Bird-mountain, below the
point called the Mo&s;chelhorn; and there,
it is &s;aid, was built a temple con&s;ecrated
to the guardian god of the &s;tream, who&s;e
tranquil &s;lumbers Boileau de&s;cribes in one
of his epi&s;tles:
<Q><L>&startq;Au pi&egrave;d du Mont Adule, entre mille ro&s;eaux,</L>
<L>Le Rhin, tranquille et fier du progr&egrave;s de &s;es eaux,</L>
<L>Appuy&eacute; d'une main &s;ur &s;on urne penchante,</L>
<L>Dormoit au bruit de &s;on onde na&iuml;&s;&s;ante.&endq;</L></Q></P>
<P>Whether Boileau took part of his de|&s;cription
from the &s;tatue of this river-god
in the Tuilleries, or, what is more pro|bable,
the Sculptor borrowed the idea of
his &s;tatue from the Poet, the place it&s;elf is
not unworthy of the divinity.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="29">
We were now at the &s;ource of that
river who&s;e gentle current had heretofore
glided from its tranquil and &s;olitary
abode, to witne&s;s the &s;cenes of carnage
with which the ambition of monarchs has
&s;o often crim&s;oned its waters, but which
then heard the &s;ongs of republican
triumph, re&s;ounding along its di&s;tant
banks. Happily the&s;e banks re-echo no
longer the din of war, or the &s;hout of
victory; the thunder of the confederated
powers on the continent of Europe,
again&s;t the liberties of France, is hu&s;hed;
and the fate of this confederacy, like
that of Roman greatne&s;s, &s;o elegantly de|&s;cribed
by Monte&s;quieu, may be com|pared
to the cour&s;e of this river, which,
&s;wollen by auxiliary &s;treams to a tre|mendous
flood, &s;inks at length, a &s;edgy
rivulet, into the boundle&s;s ocean.&mdash;Alas!
&s;o long has the iron &s;torm of war raged
around us, that the ear is become fa|miliarized
<PB N="23" REF="30">
to its &s;ounds, and the heart is
grown callous to its de&s;olation! While
the re&s;t of Europe is &s;afely &s;heltered from
its fury, why are two nations, formed for
mutual e&s;teem and admiration, &s;till fated
to brave its horrors, and remain the only
votaries at its unhallowed &s;hrine? Ah,
when will Peace, with all her meek-eyed
beamy train, with all her ble&s;&s;ed attri|butes,
re-vi&s;it the earth, and begin, once
more, her holy, her univer&s;al empire!</P>
<P>The valley of the Rhine, which is ten
miles in length, from the foot of St. Ber|nardin
to Splugen, is too lofty for any
other cultivation than that of pa&s;turage;
on one &s;ide, the rocks hung over the river
clothed with woods; on the other, the
hills ro&s;e in &s;ucce&s;sive lawns to the
Glaciers; and no &s;cenes amid&s;t the moun|tains
we had traver&s;ed had pre&s;ented a
&s;eries of objects more mildly picture&s;que.
<PB N="24" REF="31">
At Splugen this character of &s;oft and
placid beauty changes again to the wild
and the maje&s;tic. This town is the prin|cipal
dep&ocirc;t of merchandize that pa&s;&s;es
from Germany, and the Gri&s;ons, into
Italy; and is the place where the roads
divide that lead to the Valteline, and the
Swi&s;s Italian Bailliwicks.</P>
<P>At a little di&s;tance from Splugen, the
piny fore&s;ts which cover the mountains
along the &s;hadowy way, and climb up
the lofty &s;teeps, dark, wild, and impene|trable,
are half-leafle&s;s, and withered on
the highe&s;t peaks; as if vegetation had
been wor&s;ted in &s;truggling with nature
for exi&s;tence. Here the Rhine, which
had hitherto rolled &s;ometimes a placid,
and always an even current, begins fir&s;t
to di&s;play its bold and daring character;
its waters now fall in one broad expan&s;e
over the ledge of rocks that cro&s;s the
<PB N="25" REF="32">
&s;tream, down into the gulph; then, re|bounding
from the aby&s;s, glide &s;wift as
light through the &s;treights of granite that
open to admit their pa&s;&s;age, or, where
the rocks oppo&s;e their way, lift high
their feathery &s;urges, of which the great
ma&s;s fall foaming into the depths be|neath,
and the re&s;t are lo&s;t in air.</P>
<P>As we de&s;cended the mountains into
the valley of Schams, the &s;avage per|&s;pective
of the fore&s;ts &s;oftened into grace|ful
&s;cenery. Trees of milder climes di|ver&s;ify
the pro&s;pect, among which the
mountain-a&s;h reddens the rocks, over
which it throws its beautiful clu&s;ters of
berries in lavi&s;h profu&s;ion. The valley of
Schams, along which the Rhine winds,
a &s;low and gentle &s;tream, amid&s;t a num|ber
of &s;cattered villages and hamlets,
abodes of tranquil exi&s;tence, pre&s;ents a
&s;oft repo&s;ing land&s;cape, peculiarly &s;ooth|ing
<PB N="26" REF="33">
to the traveller, among the Alps, and
which unfolds it&s;elf from the midway of
a &s;olitary mountain, with its wild ac|companyment
of the da&s;hing torrent.</P>
<P>At one of tho&s;e villages where we
pa&s;&s;ed a day, we con&s;idered our&s;elves as
fortunate in finding a per&s;on by whom
we were under&s;tood; &s;ince the language
of this country is not Italian, like that of
the Valley of the Rhine, but a compo&s;ition
of all the languages under heaven; as if
the emigrants from the tower of Babel had
formed their chief colony in this plea&s;ant
&s;pot, and in proce&s;s of time had amal|gamated
the confu&s;ion of tongues into
the jargon called the Roman&s;h. In this
wild and uncouth a&s;&s;emblage of words,
&s;everal books are written; among which
we found, in the library of the good old
landlady of a village-inn, an huge &s;ilver-cla&s;ped,
and &s;trongly bra&s;s-bound Bible,
<PB N="27" REF="34">
printed in this dialect, and dedicated to
George the Fir&s;t. We were al&s;o &s;hewn a
volume of hymns, &s;ome of which were
tran&s;lated to me, and were not unplea&s;ing
&s;pecimens of mountain-poetry, applied to
Alpine images and objects; chiefly tho&s;e
of the vegetable, and flowery world, &s;uch
as the mountain-a&s;h, the myrtle, the
harebell, and the &s;heltering pine.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this valley, and of
that of the Rhine, are Prote&s;tants. In
the middle of the fifteenth century they
were under the dominions of Nobles, and
Bi&s;hops, of whom they purcha&s;ed their
freedom, and have &s;ince made a part of
the Gri&s;on government.</P>
<P>In this valley we were nearly on a
level with the re&s;t of the world; but in
order to e&s;cape entirely from this wilder|ne&s;s
of Alps, we had another mountain
<PB N="28" REF="35">
expedition to make, which, if we had
judged from the name it bears, was more
perilous than all the pa&s;t. Why the in|habitants
of this country have given the
name of Via Mala to the be&s;t road among
the mountains of Switzerland, it is &s;ome|what
difficult to conjecture; perhaps in|deed
it might once have de&s;erved this
epithet, and, like other bad reputations, is
&s;till &s;u&s;pected, though its character is re|formed.
We believed that we had al|ready,
during our Alpine journey, ex|hau&s;ted
every po&s;sible a&s;pect of mountain
&s;cenery, and that what remained, how|ever
pregnant with the varying images of
beauty, or the rugged forms of horror,
could offer only the repetition of pre|ceding
wonders; we found, however, as
we journeyed along the Via Mala, new
rea&s;ons to pau&s;e, and new objects to
admire.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="36">
After cro&s;sing the Rhine, which we
rejoined at our entrance on this road, we
lo&s;t at once all view of the fair and ample
valley, and found our&s;elves immured be|tween
pine-covered rocks of enormous
height, while, in proportion to their per|pendicular
and &s;tupendous elevation, the
river de&s;cends into gulphs equally pro|found.
Between the&s;e tremendous pre|cipices
an excellent road is formed along
the &s;ide of the mountain, which we
pa&s;&s;ed in &s;uch perfect &s;ecurity as left us
full lei&s;ure to contemplate tho&s;e mighty
cliffs above,
<Q><L>&mdash;&startq;Who&s;e highe&s;t woods, impenetrable</L>
<L>To &s;tar, or &s;un-light, &s;pread their umbrage broad</L>
<L>And brown as evening;&endq;</L></Q>
<BIBL>MILTON.</BIBL>
while we li&s;tened to the roarings of the
ingulphed waters ri&s;ing troublous from
the cha&s;m in which the river had made
its channel. After proceeding two or
<PB N="30" REF="37">
three miles along the&s;e precipices, we
caught a glimp&s;e of a bridge which hung
light in air over the aby&s;s, and &s;eemed
more to de&s;erve the reputation of having
been reared by &s;upernatural agency than
any on which we had yet gazed.</P>
<P>We pau&s;ed a con&s;iderable time on this
bridge, that we might fix the &s;cene in
our remembrance; on that &s;ide of the
mountain along which the road we had
pa&s;&s;ed was &s;u&s;pended, ro&s;e a maje&s;tic
&s;well of pine-covered &s;teeps; on the &s;ide
where we now cro&s;&s;ed, the rock &s;tood
abruptly perpendicular, leaving ju&s;t &s;pace
enough for the pa&s;&s;age, part of which
was excavated from the cliff that im|pended
beyond our darkened path, over
the gulph. The Rhine, which had
hitherto rolled its ample volume, in|crea&s;ed
by torrents, and by the &s;ix rivers
from which the valley it had left takes
<PB N="31" REF="38">
its Roman name, now &s;hrunk on the eye
from the di&s;tance at which we gazed,
into a &s;mall rivulet, labouring at the
depth of many hundred feet beneath the
bridge, foaming dark between the narrow
clefts, &s;ometimes &s;truggling with the
rocks for day, and &s;ometimes entirely hid
by their foldings from our view.</P>
<P>After pa&s;sing &s;ome hours of contempla|tion
amid&s;t the&s;e &s;cenes, where luxuriant
vegetation &s;preads her flowing veil over
the &s;tern brow of terrific wildne&s;s, we
bade adieu to the withdrawing Rhine,
which, after mounting a hill that brought
us to a village on its &s;ummit, we again
beheld in the di&s;tance, transformed into a
placid expan&s;ive river. De&s;cending into
the valley, we reached Tu&s;is, the capital
of one of the high juri&s;dictions of the
Gri&s;on-League. This town, according to
the etymologi&s;ts, was originally Tu&s;can,
<PB N="32" REF="39">
which they prove in a very &s;atisfactory
manner, from the name Tu&s;is, Tu&s;an,
with fifty more derivations, till they
arrive at Tu&s;cana.</P>
<P>The road from Tu&s;is to Coire lies along
a finely cultivated plain, with a &s;oft
boundary of &s;loping hills, clothed with
fre&s;h verdure, and woods of thick foliage,
and &s;cattered over with villages, and
country &s;eats; the Rhine glides tran|quilly
along the valley, and far above its
pa&s;toral banks, Glaciers, mingling with
clouds, form a di&s;tant horizon. There
was &s;omething deliciou&s;ly &s;oothing in
this &s;till, quiet land&s;cape, contra&s;ted with
the &s;avage chaos of Alpine &s;cenery; it
was like reading Thomp&s;on's Autumn, or
Gray's Elegy, after Milton's battle of the
Angels.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed the beautiful and picture&s;que
mountain of Heigenberg, which &s;tretches
<PB N="33" REF="40">
&s;ix miles along the plain, is well peopled
with villages, and e&s;teemed the mo&s;t fer|tile
&s;pot in the Gri&s;on dominions.</P>
<P>At Rechinau, the re&s;idence of the Im|perial
Envoy to the Gri&s;ons, the two
&s;treams of the Rhine form their junction;
and they could not have cho&s;en through|out
the country a &s;pot more delightful
for the friendly meeting that was now to
la&s;t the remainder of their cour&s;e. The
principal branch was that which we had
accompanied from its &s;pring; the other
flows along the valley of Sopra Silvas, or
the valley above the woods, which is the
mo&s;t populous part of the Gri&s;on-League,
of which Flantz is the principal town,
and the place where the General Diet
of the three Leagues a&s;&s;embles every
three years. This valley is divided from
the Canton of Glarus by high mountains
and Glaciers, which form, as u&s;ual, a
magnificent back-ground to the pa&s;toral
<PB N="34" REF="41">
country beneath, and is &s;eparated at its
clo&s;e, by a part of St. Gothard, from the
valley of Ur&s;cren. Over the two branches
of the Rhine, ju&s;t above the confluence
of their &s;treams, two bridges are built on
the &s;ame plan as that of Schaffhau&s;en.
The&s;e bridges, we were told, are much
admired for their architecture, and what
is termed a &s;ublime &s;implicity of con|&s;truction;
they may perhaps de&s;erve
prai&s;e on account of their &s;tability; but
&s;urely nothing can be more offen&s;ive to
the eye than tho&s;e huge ma&s;&s;es, covered
with wood, heavy, and mi&s;hapen from
without; di&s;mal, and dark within; &s;uch,
in my ignorance of mechanics, ap|peared
to me tho&s;e bridges which are
erected over the rivers of Switzerland in
the flat country; and the only archi|tecture
of that kind which I thought ad|mirable,
were the performances of the
Devil over the aby&s;&s;es of St. Gothard,
<PB N="35" REF="42">
and the tremendous cha&s;ms of the Via
Mala.</P>
<P>The Rhine at its confluence, becomes
an important river, and flows through the
valley with calm maje&s;tic pace, under
rocks and wooded hills, which in other
countries would be re&s;pectable mountains,
but which &s;hrink into in&s;ignificance be|fore
the eye that has long been fixed on
the gigantic Alps. We pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome miles
through a piny fore&s;t, and at length, from
the pa&s;toral valley of Rechinau, beheld
the antique towers of Coire, ri&s;ing ma|je&s;tically
from the deep bo&s;om of en|circling
mountains.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Coire.&mdash;Sketch of Government in the Gri&s;ons.&mdash;Revolt
of the Valteline.&mdash;Reunion to the Ci&s;alpine Republic.</HEAD>
<P>THE national convention of the Gri&s;ons
had &s;u&s;pended their &s;ittings two or three
weeks before our arrival at Coire. As
revolutions were abroad in the earth, it
was not extraordinary that &s;ome efforts
were made to reform an oppre&s;sive go|vernment,
when the means being com|pletely
in the power of the oppre&s;&s;ed,
the execution was neither difficult or
dangerous. The changes that had taken
place, however, we were informed by
&s;ome per&s;ons at Coire, did not merit
the name of a revolution; that what
had pa&s;&s;ed was little more than a &s;trug|gle
for power, and that the only &s;er|vice
rendered to the country, was the
<PB N="37" REF="44">
correction of a few avaricious indivi|duals
of credit and influence, by &s;ines
and forfeits, without any reformation of
the principles on which they had acted,
and in which it was probable they would
be imitated by their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>The government of this country is
democratic, that is a Swi&s;s democracy,
where, under the name of liberty, the
greate&s;t outrages are committed again&s;t
the principle. How, or when the Gri&s;ons
fir&s;t &s;hook off the yoke of their former
governors, is not well known; but the
union of the three leagues, of which
the Gri&s;on government is compo&s;ed, took
place in the beginning of the &s;ixteenth
century. The point of contact between
the thou&s;and and one republics of this
country, for every community is a &s;e|parate
&s;tate, and has a different form of
government, is a general diet of their
<PB N="38" REF="45">
chiefs, held once a year in the capital
of one of the three leagues; which diet
is formed of &s;ixty-three deputies, &s;ent
from the various communities in propor|tion
to their extent or influence.</P>
<P>A disjointed government like this, mu&s;t
nece&s;&s;arily be &s;ubject to the influence of
political intrigue. The deputy named to
the diet by a &s;overeign pea&s;ant of four|teen
years of age, or in the direct and
unqualified manner in which he is
elected by the &s;overeign fathers, is mo&s;t
commonly either a noi&s;y intriguer,
who&s;e pretentions have aba&s;hed the
man of mode&s;t merit, or what is more
likely to happen, the wealthy Lord who
has corrupted his con&s;tituents; bribing
being a practice univer&s;ally admitted
among&s;t the rights of the people in
Swi&s;s democracies.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="46">
Thus by intrigue and corruption the&s;e
democracies become not ari&s;tocracies,
compo&s;ed of citizens &s;killed in legi&s;la|tion,
and endowed with principles that
tend to the amelioration of &s;ociety,
but oligarchies framed of individuals
who con&s;ider the rights of the people
as their own privileges, and who en|courage
tho&s;e vices in the community
by which they increa&s;e their revenues,
in&s;tead of checking them by wi&s;e re|gulations,
and &s;alutary laws.</P>
<P>The&s;e evils would probably have been
longer borne without remon&s;trance, had
not the imprudent exce&s;s of avarice in
the governors at length awakened the
re&s;entment of the plundered. In former
times, the cupidity of the magi&s;trate
had been checked by the fear of the
&s;ummary puni&s;hment of the Strafgericht,
a kind of &s;tar-chamber, where not only
<PB N="40" REF="47">
the guilt of the rich man was &s;ure
to meet with expiation, but where even
wealthy innocence was in&s;ecure; &s;ince
the Radamanthus of this inexorable tri|bunal
were &s;harers in the arbitrary pe|nalties
they impo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The a&s;cendency of the opulent citi|zens
in the affairs of government has
long &s;ince brought this tribunal into
di&s;u&s;e. It was, indeed, often made the
in&s;trument of private hatred, and fac|tious
vengeance; but as it was al&s;o a
terror to evil doers, an&s;wered &s;ome
of the purpo&s;es for which it was in|tended.
Since its abolition, &s;ays a wri|ter
on this &s;ubject, &startq;the chiefs make
treaties with foreign powers without the
con&s;ent of their con&s;tituents, and &s;ell
ju&s;tice by auction, and ruin tho&s;e whom
they &s;u&s;pect to have intere&s;ts ho&s;tile
to their own.&endq; This accu&s;ation was
<PB N="41" REF="48">
made again&s;t the fathers of the la&s;t ge|neration,
and it is to be lamented, that
their &s;ons not having the fear of the
&s;tar-chamber before their eyes, or the
love of any thing but money in their
hearts, have left this fatal propen&s;ity to
their children, the Gri&s;on governors of
the pre&s;ent day.</P>
<P>Over this community ignorance holds
its leaden &s;ceptre, not the ignorance of
&s;implicity, ari&s;ing from the want of
communication with the world, but
from a &s;tate of &s;ocial degradation. In
vain &s;ome Eurylochus, who had e&s;caped
the contagion, endeavoured to reclaim
his countrymen by introducing among&s;t

<P>The moral and political vices of the&s;e
democracies can furni&s;h no arguments
again&s;t governments founded on the
rights of the people; &s;ince the abu&s;e of
principles can never de&s;troy the force

inconclu&s;ive rea&s;oning to a&s;&s;ert that be|cau&s;e

nece&s;&s;arily be infected with &s;imilar vices.
We might with the &s;ame truth a&s;&s;ert,
that becau&s;e the republics of Greece
and Rome, but half known to freedom,
were &s;ometimes di&s;turbed by faction,
liberty was therefore not made for man;
although, perhaps, ignorant of its true
principles, one of the&s;e republics &s;ub|dued
the world by its valour, and the
other dignified it with all that is great
in literature, and the arts.</P>
<P>Like the democracies, and other free
&s;tates of Switzerland, the democracy of
the Gri&s;ons had its ultramontane terri|tories,
and its &s;ubjects, its procon&s;uls,
conquered provinces, tributes, homages,
<PB N="44" REF="51">
and other di&s;tingui&s;hed marks of ab&s;o|lute
&s;overeignty.</P>
<P>The Valteline, comprehending the pro|vinces
of Bormio, and Chiavenna, now
forming part of the Ci&s;alpine republic,
were, at the time of our vi&s;it to the
Gri&s;ons, a dependency of that govern|ment.
The country of the Valteline is
&s;eparated from the Gri&s;ons on the north,
and from the &s;tates of Venice on the
ea&s;t, and the &s;outh, by Alpine moun|tains
and Glaciers, and is open on the
we&s;t to the plains of Milan; from which
government it was di&s;membered in the
beginning of the &s;ixteenth century, when
the Gri&s;ons and the bi&s;hop of Coire,
the la&s;t of whom had pretentions in
right of &s;ome frivolous donation, and
the former repo&s;ing their pretentions on
tho&s;e of their bi&s;hop, drove out the
<PB N="45" REF="52">
French, and became the legitimate po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of this country is little
more than a di&s;play of the wor&s;t pa&s;|&s;ions
of mankind. The bi&s;hop was di&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of his &s;hare of the &s;overeignty
&s;oon after the conque&s;t. In the begin|ning
of the &s;eventeenth century, the in|habitants
&s;tung to madne&s;s by the terri|ble
oppre&s;sion of their ma&s;ters, who
attempted among&s;t other acts of ty|ranny,
to introduce by force the re|formation
which they had them&s;elves
embraced, committed a general ma&s;&s;acre
of &s;uch of their oppre&s;&s;ors as were in
their power, threw off their yoke, and
placed them&s;elves under the protection
of the king of Spain.</P>
<P>By the aid of the Swi&s;s prote&s;tant
Cantons, and of France, during the ad|mini&s;tration
<PB N="46" REF="53">
of Richlieu, the Gri&s;ons
became again ma&s;ters of the&s;e provinces,
but with powers more limited. Di&s;con|tented
at the privileges granted to their
&s;ubjects by the &s;tipulations which they
were compelled to make with the French,
and which they con&s;idered as deroga|tory
to their &s;overeign dignity, the
Gri&s;ons &s;ought the aid of their former
enemies, the Spaniards, who not only
a&s;si&s;ted them in expelling the French
from the Valteline, but delivered up
this unfortunate people whom they had
&s;ome years before taken under their
protection, after having excited them to
revolt, into the hands of their ancient
oppre&s;&s;ors, under who&s;e dominion they
have remained till the late epocha of
their hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>All that is vicious in the principle
of Swi&s;s ultramontane government, was
<PB N="47" REF="54">
reduced to rigorous practice by the
Gri&s;ons in the Valteline. The wretched
inhabitants were not only robbed with
impunity by code&s;tas and bailiffs, who
had previou&s;ly purcha&s;ed the right of
plunder from their co-&s;overeigns the
Gri&s;ons, from whom collectively they
held their authority; but the hi&s;tory
of the &s;hamele&s;s manner in which that
power was admini&s;tered, is too di&s;gu&s;t|ing
for detail.</P>
<P>Although the inhabitants of the Valte|line
have been compelled to &s;ubmit by
force to this coar&s;e tyranny, their &s;pirit
has never been &s;ubdued. The indig|nation
which has led them at the pre|&s;ent
moment to &s;hake off the yoke
of their tyrants, they have inherited
in long &s;ucce&s;sion from their fore-fathers,
of who&s;e contempt of the Gri&s;ons the
Duke of Rohan treats in his Memoires
<PB N="48" REF="55">
on the Valteline war; where, though
an ally of the&s;e democracies, he a&s;|&s;erts,
that &startq;their deplorable corruption
is become an incurable evil, proceeding
from the nature of the people who
have raked together all the vices of
Europe without collecting a &s;ingle vir|tue.&endq;</P>
<P>The day of deliverance for the&s;e op|pre&s;&s;ed
&s;ubjects of the Gri&s;on democra|cies
was, however, drawing nigh. The
&s;houts of liberty that filled the plains
of Lombardy, re-echoed amid&s;t their
rocks, and rou&s;ed into a noble and ge|nerous
flame the &s;mothered indignation
which power had &s;o long compre&s;&s;ed.
Placed near the &s;pot where waved the
banners of the French Republic, the
Valtelines were not again compelled
to break their chains on the heads of
their oppre&s;&s;ors, or &s;eek refuge from their
<PB N="49" REF="56">
&s;lavery as heretofore, in the arms of
de&s;poti&s;m. The will to be free was now
become the only price of freedom;
and the &s;ecurity of their independence
no more repo&s;es on the caprice of
princes, who might again betray them,
as they have already been betrayed,
but is founded on tho&s;e great and eter|nal
principles, the impre&s;criptible rights
of mankind, which no &s;ophi&s;try can
controvert, and which no power can
de&s;troy.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Gri&s;on Mode of negociating.&mdash;Deputation to Buonaparte.&mdash;Buonaparte.</HEAD>
<P>THE late in&s;urrection of the&s;e pro|vinces,
was not an ordinary revolt
&s;uch as had been often excited in the&s;e
&s;ubject States, and which the power of
the &s;overeign aided by that of the Can|tons
always confederated to cru&s;h re|bellions,
had till now been able to
&s;ubdue. The pre&s;ence of French armies,
and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a new republic
in the neighbourhood, were circum&s;tances
that wore &s;o formidable an a&s;pect, that
an alliance of the Cantons in the pre|&s;ent
in&s;tance was judged inexpedi|ent,
and the Gri&s;ons were left to ar|range
their own concerns with their re|volted
&s;ubjects. The Gri&s;ons were not
inclined to try the fate of arms, but
<PB N="51" REF="58">
&s;atisfied them&s;elves with reque&s;ting the
mediation of the French Republic to
bring back their rebellious children to
their duty. This mediation was accepted
by the revolted provinces, and it was
agreed that deputations &s;hould be &s;ent
by both parties to Milan, where the
French General &s;hould hear and decide
between them. The &s;ubjects &s;ent their
deputies immediately, and frequent me&s;|&s;ages
were di&s;patched to the Gri&s;ons, to
reque&s;t the pre&s;ence al&s;o of their am|ba&s;&s;ador.
Some time elap&s;ed, and no
amba&s;&s;ador appearing, the French Gene|ral
by means of the envoy of the
Republic at Coire, who had often urged
the Gri&s;ons to fulfil the engagement
they had made of accepting this me|diation,
informed them that the fatal
term was fixed at a month from the
di&s;patch of the me&s;&s;age. The Gri&s;ons
continued to keep a profound &s;ilence,
<PB N="52" REF="59">
no an&s;wer was returned, and no depu|ties
were &s;ent. The French General
therefore undertook, with the help of
the Ci&s;alpine Republic, to &s;ettle the bu|&s;ine&s;s
without their interpo&s;ition; and
after recapitulating the cau&s;es of the
di&s;content of the governed, and the re|fu&s;al
of the governors to abide by their
own engagements, after decreeing that
&startq;no people can be the &s;ubjects of
another people, without violating the
principles of public and natural right,
and that the provinces were di&s;&s;olved
from every kind of allegiance, declared
the people of the Valteline, Chiavenna,
and Bormio, a free and independent
nation, and accepted the re-union which
they &s;olicited to the Ci&s;alpine Repub|lic.&endq;</P>
<P>The Gri&s;on governors, when they &s;aw
of how little avail had been their dig|nified
<PB N="53" REF="60">
&s;ilence, began to reproach each
other bitterly for their conduct. The
people them&s;elves gave louder tokens of
their di&s;content. Deputies from various
communes ha&s;tened to Coire, and de|manded
the convocation of a general
diet, the di&s;mi&s;sion of the Congre&s;s,
the renewal of their friend&s;hip with
France, and the admi&s;sion of the Valte|line
to a part of their &s;overeignty.
The&s;e demands were &s;ubmitted by the
Congre&s;s to all the communes of the
three leagues; their deputies a&s;&s;embled,
and after having depo&s;ed and arre&s;ted
the three chiefs, and the whole of the
members of the &s;ilent congre&s;s, and
appointed a commi&s;sion of thirty to
reform abu&s;es and complete the re|volution,
decreed that amba&s;&s;adors &s;hould
be &s;ent to demand a revi&s;ion of the &s;en|tence
pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t them, to offer ex|cu&s;es

ambition, delighted in making the world
groan under its chains; or of profligate

of the conqueror, have &s;unk under the
genius of the poet; who, with confede|rated
frenzy, has goaded on to new crimes,
by &s;tringing to his immortal lyre the
prai&s;es of heroes who were pa&s;t, and
extolling with frantic rapture tho&s;e bril|liant

de&s;troyed, and provinces de&s;olated.
It is not Buonaparte &s;caling the Alps,

its choice&s;t prey, that claims the tran&s;|port

Phaenomena.</HEAD>
<P>THE road from Coire lies along the
banks of the Rhine, through an ample
valley, bounded by mountains which &s;till
retain &s;ome features of the &s;avage Alpine
character. The land&s;cape &s;oftened its
rugged brow as we advanced through
pa&s;toral meadows to Mayenfield, which
we went out of our road to vi&s;it. This
town is the boundary of the Gri&s;on
government, and, from &s;ome peculiarity
in the original contract of union, is at
once &s;ubject to the Gri&s;on league, and
co-&s;overeign. Returning back towards
Coire, we cro&s;&s;ed a bridge over the
Rhine, and followed the road leading to
Ragatz, and the baths of Pffyffer. The&s;e
baths are re&s;orted to by the &s;ick, for the
cure of various maladies; and to the
<PB N="59" REF="66">
lovers of nature in her mo&s;t romantic
garb, no re&s;idence can be more delightful
than the habitation which is built for the
reception of vi&s;itors. The water is con|ducted
to this dwelling by pipes; the
place where it takes its &s;ource, and where
with great inconvenience, and even dan|ger,
the &s;ick were formerly compelled to
de&s;cend, being now vi&s;ited only by tho&s;e
who are curious to &s;ee a gulph which
conveys an image of the more tremendous
aby&s;&s;es of the Alps.</P>
<P>The Abbey of Pffyffer is &s;ituated on
the hill ri&s;ing from the Rhine, and com|mands
a magnificent view over the
country beneath. The Abbot is Prince of
the Empire, and Seigneur, not only of
the baths, which are greatly indebted to
his muni&s;icence and that of his prede|ce&s;&s;ors,
but al&s;o of all the country around.
The Abbey is of the order of St. Benedict,
<PB N="60" REF="67">
and dates its origin from the eighth
century.</P>
<P>From Ragatz we journied on to Sar|gans,
a Bailliwick belonging to the eight
original Cantons, who each in their turn
&s;end a Bailiff, who&s;e office la&s;ts two years.
The town is &s;ituated on a gentle a&s;cent,
beneath the lofty Schalberb, which forms
a chain of the mountains of Appenzell.
The ca&s;tle, which was the con&s;tant re|&s;idence
of the Counts of Sargans, is &s;eated
on a rock that overlooks the town, and
pre&s;ents a picture&s;que appearance from
the road. The inhabitants are of the
mixt religion, and have &s;ome &s;ort of pri|vilege
in the election of their magi&s;trates
under the in&s;pection of the Bailiff.</P>
<P>The town of Wallen&s;tadt, &s;ubject to
the eight Cantons, and comprehended in
the Bailliwick of Sargans, is &s;ituated at
<PB N="61" REF="68">
the head of the lake which bears its
name, and is one of the principal dep&ocirc;ts
of merchandize pa&s;sing between the Gri|&s;ons
and Switzerland. As almo&s;t the
whole of this region is &s;ubject-country,
there is little diver&s;ity in their forms of
government: &s;ome have more privileges
than others; but all are &s;ubject to the
&s;overeign will of the free Cantons, and
of the Bailiffs, their legitimate repre|&s;entatives.</P>
<P>The weather was remarkably fine when
we arrived at Wallen&s;tadt, although the
rain which had fallen during the night,
had &s;pread over the mountains a thin
covering of &s;now. We concluded that in
two or three hours we &s;hould be tran&s;|ported
down the lake to We&s;en, as we
came in time to take advantage of the
ea&s;terly wind which we were told blows
in that direction the fir&s;t half of the
<PB N="62" REF="69">
day. The morning of our arrival was,
however, an exception to the general
rule, and the wind blew ob&s;tinately from
the we&s;t. The boatmen &s;eemed di&s;|inclined
to venture; and the ma&s;ter of
the inn &s;upporting their repre&s;entations,
we di&s;continued our in&s;tances; and, fear|ing
the wind might remain in the &s;ame
humour the next day, and the day after,
determined to render our&s;elves independ|ent
of its caprice, by travelling along the
&s;outhern &s;ide of the lake, and over the
<HI>mountain,</HI> to Glaris.</P>
<P>The road, we were a&s;&s;ured, was very
practicable; and &s;uch it might be deemed
by the inhabitants of tho&s;e wild regions,
and by our&s;elves indeed, accu&s;tomed as
we now were to difficult enterprizes in
travelling; but as the common mode of
tran&s;port is by water, no attention was
paid to keep it in repair. In &s;ome places
<PB N="63" REF="70">
we were obliged to de&s;cend into the
lake, in others to climb over rocks, tru&s;t|ing
to the prudence and &s;kill of our
hor&s;es, rather than to our own judgment.
But the dangers of the way were often
forgotten in admiration of the &s;cene
through which it led.</P>
<P>On the &s;outhern &s;ide of the lake along
which we journied, the &s;welling hills are
covered with fine pa&s;turage, and ro|mantic
woods, inter&s;per&s;ed with hamlets
and cottages up to the lofty &s;now-covered
&s;teeps that form the mountains of Glaris.
Over the lake on the northern &s;ide, the
Glattewand reared its perpendicular head
near two thou&s;and feet from the water,
and pre&s;enting along its edge a terrific
prolongation of inacce&s;sible rampart, far
as the Ammon, from who&s;e &s;till loftier
&s;ummit the Ammenback rolls, in maje&s;tic
cataracts, its ample volume, who&s;e &s;weep|ing
<PB N="64" REF="71">
grandeur and re&s;ounding roar, though
&s;oftened in their effect by the di&s;tance,
fixed us long to the &s;pot from whence we
gazed.</P>
<P>After a ride of &s;ome hours, we quitted
the lake, and began to a&s;cend the moun|tains
of Kerenzen. Here the path became
&s;till more dangerous, &s;ometimes leading
us to the very edge of the precipice,
which hung over the di&s;tant ma&s;s of
waters, far beneath, and &s;ometimes being
&s;o perpendicularly &s;teep, that we owed
our &s;afety entirely to the goat-like habits
of climbing which our hor&s;es had ac|quired
in their travels over the Alps.</P>
<P>The Swi&s;s mountains &s;eldom furni&s;h
objects of per&s;pective; but the pro&s;pect
from Kerenzen left us no regrets for the
we&s;terly wind, or the difficulties of the
journey. We had now a&s;cended the
<PB N="65" REF="72">
mountains of Glaris; the views we had
hitherto enjoyed unfolded them&s;elves in
more ample extent; and the enormous
ridge of rock on the northern &s;ide of the
lake, fell beneath our eyes, and &s;eemed
only to &s;kirt the waters. In the back|ground
of the heights on which we &s;tood,
the eye ranged over craggy peaks and
&s;ummits, far as the immen&s;ely di&s;tant
Alps and Glaciers of the Tyrol. Their
&s;nows were tinged with the purple light
of the la&s;t beams of the &s;un, which, en|circled
by a glorious canopy of clouds,
was de&s;cending on the lake of Zurich,
that lay before us in long per&s;pective,
blazing like the orb which lent its lu&s;tre;
and when viewed through the tele&s;cope,
pre&s;enting its ruffled waters, and the
ve&s;&s;els gliding on their &s;urface, like the
tremulations on the di&s;k of that luminary,
and the &s;pots within its circle.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="73">
We had loitered high up the moun|tain,
led on by the maje&s;tic &s;cenery both
of heaven and of earth, when we were in|formed
by the knot of pea&s;ants who had
a&s;&s;embled around us from the little huts
in the neighbourhood, and had been
amu&s;ing them&s;elves al&s;o in peeping oc|ca&s;ionally
through our gla&s;&s;es, that the
&s;torm was ri&s;ing from the lake, and might
reach us before we de&s;cended to the vil|lage
where we had left our hor&s;es. We
could perceive no appearance of this
threatened tempe&s;t; but &s;oon after we
heard the thunder rolling along the op|po&s;ite
cliffs, and found that the moun|taineers
were endowed with clearer per|ceptions
of di&s;covery than our&s;elves. We
had not proceeded far before our own
mountains became the &s;eat of uproar, and
fanta&s;tic tortuous threads of lightning
twi&s;ted them&s;elves around us, and fla&s;hed
before our eyes in forms of endle&s;s va|riety.
<PB N="67" REF="74">
The pea&s;ants having a&s;&s;ured me
that tho&s;e vivid lightnings played harm|le&s;s
in that region, we de&s;cended &s;till
further, and had taken leave of our
guides, as we were now within reach of
the village, when we &s;topped to gaze on
another phaenomenon, no le&s;s remarkable
than the former. This was the &s;low ap|proach
of the genius of the &s;torm, in his
habitation of pitchy darkne&s;s, and which
appeared as if one of the adjoining moun|tains
was on its march. This immen&s;e,
and apparently ponderous body of clouds,
moved onwards to a &s;pot not far di&s;tant
from us, before we could well appreciate
its &s;ub&s;tance; when the moon ri&s;ing be|hind
us &s;uddenly, threw her bright beams
on the vaporous ma&s;s, and pre&s;ented to
our gaze a perfect rainbow, cha&s;tened in
its colours by the &s;oft reflection of lunar
light. This mountain of clouds remained
fixed in its &s;tation, from the dying away
<PB N="68" REF="75">
of the breeze by which it had been im|pelled,
till at length it &s;unk into air, and
no longer chained us to the &s;pot by the
&s;trong attraction of a new and &s;ublime

<P>THE next morning we cro&s;&s;ed the
Walenberg, and de&s;cended into the valley
of Glaris, through fore&s;ts of pine, and
pa&s;turages, &s;prinkled over with cattle, the
road offering at every &s;tep rich pro&s;pects
of the lake of Zurich, and the country
ri&s;ing from its banks. In the opening
of this valley are &s;eated two or three
plea&s;ant villages, of which Nefels is cele|brated
for the victory gained over the
Au&s;trian army, at the clo&s;e of the four|teenth
century, when about four hundred
men, by a Samp&s;on-like manoeuvre, de|feated
a numerous ho&s;t, by rolling &s;tones
from the mountains, and cru&s;hing the in|vaders,
who were entangled in the ravins
<PB N="70" REF="77">
beneath.&mdash;The town of Glaris is neatly
built, and the principal &s;treet is orna|mented
with fountains. This indeed is a
decoration that belongs to mo&s;t of the
towns of Switzerland; the &s;treets are
u&s;ually purified, and enlivened by limpid
currents, which flow along their &s;ides;
and the highe&s;t roads are often cheered
with the &s;ame lavi&s;h gift of nature. I
ob&s;erved that wherever I wandered in
Switzerland, on mountain, or in valley, I
never cea&s;ed to hear the &s;ound of waters;
the rill, the brook, the lake, the torrent,
the ca&s;cade, in all their rich variety of
tones, &s;ometimes &s;oft, &s;ometimes loud,
&s;trike &s;ucce&s;sively upon the &s;oul, or fill
up one mighty harmony. The appear|ance
of Glaris, buried between lofty and
almo&s;t perpendicular mountains, which
were covered from the &s;torm of the pre|ceding
evening with a layer of &s;now, is
picture&s;que and romantic; but the city is
<PB N="71" REF="78">
placed in the mo&s;t inconvenient part of
the valley.</P>
<P>We a&s;cended no further than Glaris,
and were therefore deprived of the grati|fication
of &s;eeing tho&s;e parts of the Can|ton
which are e&s;teemed the mo&s;t beauti|ful
and intere&s;ting. Mr. Ramond ob|&s;erves,
that this country, &s;ecured by im|pregnable
mountains, &startq;&s;eems to have
been de&s;tined by nature for the inviolable
a&s;ylum of liberty.&endq; The mountains may
have been powerful auxiliaries in the
attainment of liberty; but without the
unconquerable mind, the firm purpo&s;e
to be free that fir&s;t broke the chains
of &s;ervitude, mountains would have
proved but feeble ramparts. Tho&s;e of
the &startq;iron frontier of France&endq; were
twice found in&s;ecure again&s;t the in|vading
ho&s;t; and it was on the plains
of Champagne, and Fleurus, that the
<PB N="72" REF="79">
Genius of War bent before that of
Liberty.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tories of the&s;e Cantons are
nearly the &s;ame; the &s;ame &s;overeignty
and the &s;ame &s;ervitude. Some of the
Cantons bore the yoke of Kings, &s;ome of
Nobles; that of Glaris was under the
tutorage of the Abbe&s;s and Nuns of
Seckingen, who transferred their privi|leges
to the &s;on of an Emperor. The
Swi&s;s appear to have been treated with as
little ceremony in tho&s;e days, as the
Poles in our own. There is, however,
one circum&s;tance belonging to this &s;pe|cies
of traffic in which the refinement
of our civilized times claims the pre|eminence
over the barbarous ages; the
rights of mankind were then the only ob|jects
of barter, while one of the mo&s;t pro|fitable
branches of commercial &s;pecula|tion
at pre&s;ent, is the &s;ale of the &s;pecies
<PB N="73" REF="80">
it&s;elf. Yet from this mon&s;trous, this co|lo&s;&s;al
crime, many of the nations of
Europe turn away abhorrent; and the
execrable traffic belongs almo&s;t exclu|&s;ively
to that de&s;potic country which fir&s;t
di&s;covered, and which &s;till holds in her
feeble, but oppre&s;sive gra&s;p, the we&s;tern
hemi&s;phere; and to that i&s;land which
was the birth-place, and the refuge of
liberty; but where now,

In the middle of the fourteenth century,
the neighbouring Cantons having driven
the Au&s;trians out of their own country,
rendered the &s;ame &s;ervice to the Canton
of Glaris; and the battle of Nefels con|firmed
the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;sion. The Govern|ment
is purely democratical. A Council
<PB N="74" REF="81">
of Regency, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ixty-three
members, compo&s;e the executive power,
of which the officer called the Landam|man,
is the chief. The legi&s;lative power
re&s;ides in the ma&s;s of the people, above
the age of &s;ixteen, who meet in general
a&s;&s;embly, once a year, to propo&s;e laws, or
&s;anction regulations provi&s;ionally adopted
by the executive power; to make alli|ances,
declare war, or peace, and name
their public officers. The&s;e a&s;&s;emblies
are held, for the mo&s;t part, in the &s;pring;
Mr. Ramond gives an intere&s;ting ac|count
of one at which he was pre&s;ent
when the treaty with France was the &s;ub|ject
of di&s;cu&s;sion. A fall of rain had
&s;welled the torrents, and prevented the
greater part of the Sovereign people from
attending. The Canton, it &s;eems, was di|vided
into two parties, one of which was
in oppo&s;ition to the reigning powers.
This party, being on the right &s;ide of the
<PB N="75" REF="82">
torrents, were for proceeding immediately
to bu&s;ine&s;s, and catching the favourable
opportunity of the fall of rain which pre|vented
the arrival of their opponents.
But, after long debate, this propo&s;ition
was over-ruled, and the meeting ad|journed.</P>
<P>&startq;During the Sunday,&endq; continues Mr.
Ramond, &startq;the Voters came into Schivan|den
from all &s;ides; and the number being
nearly complete, they a&s;&s;embled, the fol|lowing
day, on a meadow of a few acres,
at the foot of a mountain and near the
village, where the general a&s;&s;embly is
held. A quadruple row of benches was
placed, and a circle formed of more than
three hundred feet in diameter. The ma|gi&s;trates
having taken their &s;eats in the
inner part of the circle, the people, con|&s;i&s;ting
of about four thou&s;and men, all
armed, &s;eated them&s;elves on the other
<PB N="76" REF="83">
benches, without di&s;tinction, except their
pa&s;tors, who were placed next their ma|gi&s;trates.
The Pre&s;ident &s;tood leaning on
the &s;word of Liberty, near the centre of
the circle, with the Secretary, and two
Serjeants, dre&s;&s;ed in the livery of the
Canton. The women keep at a di&s;tance;
but boys not yet &s;ixteen have a right
to go within the circle, provided they
remain &s;eated, and do not di&s;turb the
deliberations<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">&startq;The Pre&s;ident leans on a long and heavy cimeter, being one of tho&s;e which were formerly employed in driving out the Au&s;trians. It is without ornament, and was the &s;word of &s;ome valorous pa|triot of the fourteenth century. What a &s;ceptre is &s;uch a &s;word, when it is a Republican who wields it&punc;&endq;&mdash;M. RAMOND.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The A&s;&s;embly was opened by a di&s;|cour&s;e
from the Pre&s;ident, who gave an
account, with noble &s;implicity, of the
<PB N="77" REF="84">
details of his commi&s;sion, and of the
rea&s;ons which had led him to &s;ign the
treaty&mdash;He then propo&s;ed its ratifica|tion,
for which the Amba&s;&s;ador of France
was waiting at Soleure. An object of
&s;uch importance &s;hould be decided by
the majority of voices; but the whole
A&s;&s;embly cried out with one voice, that
it was u&s;ele&s;s to count them, and that
if there were a citizen pre&s;ent who was
not a friend to the French, it was better
he kept him&s;elf concealed. The ac|clamations
were redoubled with a tran&s;|port
of which I explained the cau&s;e, and
not without &s;ome pride to my Engli&s;h
companions.&endq;</P>
<P>This overflowing affection might po&s;|&s;ibly
have been founded on honourable
motives, yet it is difficult to di&s;cover at
fir&s;t &s;ight, what was the tie of &s;ympathy
<PB N="78" REF="85">
between the two Governments. Habitual
intercour&s;e &s;ometimes changes repug|nance
into friend&s;hip; and it was per|haps
from tho&s;e habits that the Demo|cracy
of Glaris, like the other Democra|cies
of Switzerland, became enamoured
of the de&s;poti&s;m of France. But it is
&s;ingular enough, that when France, in
becoming free, de&s;erved and claimed the
continuance of this faithful attachment,
we then &s;aw no Pre&s;ident of any Canton
of Switzerland &startq;leaning on the &s;word
that had heretofore been the in&s;trument of
repelling Au&s;trians,&endq; propo&s;e the renewal
of a treaty with France; we heard no
unanimous exclamation, that &startq;If there
was a citizen not a friend to the French,
he had better keep him&s;elf concealed;&endq;
and, no me&s;&s;age propo&s;ed with bur&s;ts
of applau&s;e, to the French Amba&s;&s;ador
at Soleure. The&s;e republican allies of
<PB N="79" REF="86">
France had driven him, in the moment
of her di&s;tre&s;s, to &s;eek refuge in another
di&s;trict.</P>
<P>The popular A&s;&s;emblies of the little
Cantons have excited the enthu&s;ia&s;m of
generous minds, who fancied that they &s;aw
in tho&s;e democracies the return of the age
of the old Romans, and the republicans
of Greece. The elegant writer whom I
have quoted, admits however, that the
hi&s;tory of Switzerland furni&s;hes terrible
examples of the furious pa&s;sions at tho&s;e
meetings.</P>
<P>We have already mentioned the pro|ject
of the Oppo&s;ition upon the &s;well of
the torrent. &startq;The tumultuous menaces
and pre&s;&s;ure of the turbulent groupe on
the Pre&s;ident and Council,&endq; adds M.
Ramond, &startq;pre&s;ented a &s;pectacle fright|ful
indeed to tho&s;e who had been ac|cu&s;tomed
<PB N="80" REF="87">
to peaceable a&s;&s;emblies.&endq; Rou&s;|&s;eau
had al&s;o probably overlooked tho&s;e
inconveniencies of Democracy, when, in
his Social Contract, he treated repre&s;enta|tive
government as a political here&s;y, and
became the panegyri&s;t of tho&s;e le&s;&s;er
tyrannies, from di&s;gu&s;t, no doubt, at the
monotonous oppre&s;sion of de&s;potic go|vernments.</P>
<P>This Canton pre&s;ents a truly amiable
picture of religious toleration: while, in
the other governments of Switzerland,
the dominating religion
<Q>&startq;Bears, like the Turk, no Brother near the throne,&endq;</Q>
<BIBL>POPE.</BIBL>
here the diver&s;ity of faith makes no
di&s;tinction in charity, and the only dif|ference
is in the preponderance of num|bers.
The Prote&s;tants being the great
majority, the Pre&s;ident of that profe&s;sion
<PB N="81" REF="88">
remains in office three years, while the
Catholic holds his &s;eat but two; the
Council of Regency is al&s;o cho&s;en in
the proportion of the population. The
church is common to both &s;ects; and no|thing
is in di&s;u&s;e with both parties but
the organ, which, being an e&s;&s;ential part
of divine &s;ervice, cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to
emit with equal harmony orthodox and
heretical &s;ounds.</P>
<P>The love of dominion, in other re|&s;pects,
pervades this Canton, as it does
all the others of the Confederation. This
democracy has al&s;o its appropriate &s;ub|jects
in the country of Verdenberg, and
its &s;hare of different &s;ubject countries in
Switzerland, &s;uch as the Rhintal, Sar|gans,
Thurgovia, and the dominions
beyond the Alps. So great is the purity
of manners in this Canton, that no ca|pital
crimes are committed, and the
<PB N="82" REF="89">
name of a public execution is not
known. Twenty years &s;ince, we are
told, that a foreign executioner was
hired for this di&s;agreeable office; yet I
heard from a re&s;pectable Magi&s;trate of
Ba&s;il, that, not above ten years &s;ince, the
Judges of this Canton condemned an old
woman to death, under pretence of her
being a Witch.</P>

&s;uch as pa&s;toral hills, gardens, vines,

with country &s;eats, and well

convenient modes of communication.
A greater quantity of cultivated land,
and fewer lakes might, perhaps, be
more u&s;eful, though it would be le&s;s
picture&s;que; and it was, no doubt, with
this patriotic per&s;ua&s;ion, that a citizen
of &s;ome eminence at Lucerne, while I
was dwelling with rapture on the ro|mantic
beauties of his lake, ob&s;erved to
me, that had they a King in Switzer|land,
he would &s;oon find means of
drying it up. How &s;trange an idea this

<P>The lake of Zurich is about thirty miles

the bridge of Rapper&s;chwill is built

<P>Zurich enjoys a high pre-eminence
above the other towns of Switzerland

the Athens of Switzerland, and there is
no place where literature is cultivated
with more ardour, or where the pub|lic
mind is better informed.</P>
<P>This ta&s;te for letters, whatever ten|dency
it may have had to purify their
manners, has been ineffectual to cor+rect
the vices of the government. The
Canton of Zurich, like that of Ba&s;il, has
its great and little councils, and two
Burgo-ma&s;ters; it contains upwards of
one hundred and &s;eventy thou&s;and &s;ouls,
but the &s;overeignty re&s;ides in a por|tion
<PB N="86" REF="93">
only of the citizens of Zurich not
exceeding two thou&s;and; if, therefore,
the &s;uperior magnitude of this Canton
to that of Ba&s;il be con&s;idered, and the
di&s;proportionate numbers who po&s;&s;e&s;s the
rights of &s;overeignity, Zurich will be
found the more de&s;potic government.
Of the&s;e two thou&s;and, two hundred
only are inve&s;ted with power, the re|mainder
having no other privilege than
that of being rai&s;ed by the choice of
the councils to a &s;hare in the dignity
when a vacancy happens by death; &s;o
that the government is nothing but a
mere oligarchy, incompatible with every
idea of a free political in&s;titution.</P>
<P>The &s;y&s;tem of monopolizing is prac|ti&s;ed
with greater &s;everity in this town
than at Ba&s;il. In the former Canton,
all who are not of the number of the
elect, and within the pale of the two
<PB N="87" REF="94">
thou&s;and, are &s;trangers, &s;ubjects or &s;erfs,
and can engage in no commerce, exer|ci&s;e
no profe&s;sion, or even hope to ar|rive
at the dignity of Burgher, which
confers the&s;e important privileges, it
being now near two centuries &s;ince this
corporation has permitted any acce&s;sion
to its members. This civic degradation
is, however, but a negative kind of pu|ni&s;hment
compared with the vexations
to which the unprivileged cla&s;&s;es are
compelled to &s;ubmit at the nod of the
Burghers their &s;overeigns. The pea&s;ant
is &s;trictly prohibited tran&s;mitting the
object of his indu&s;try and labour acro&s;s
the limits of his Canton, or in any
other direction than that of the town
of Zurich. To labour for the profit
of the Burgher is the occupation of his

Whence then did it ari&s;e, that
no advocate but the pen of a foreigner
was found to plead the cau&s;e of the
&s;ubject towns of the Canton, when two
years &s;ince their repre&s;entations of the

We are told that at Zurich, more than
in any other town of Switzerland, that zeal

But a hero of the fourteenth century
who cha&s;ed the Au&s;trians from the &s;oil,
would, perhaps, frown with contempt
on this boa&s;ted &s;pirit of freedom, could
he behold the recent &s;everities which
the&s;e republican lovers of equal rights
have exerci&s;ed again&s;t their oppre&s;&s;ed
&s;ubjects. The municipal and internal
regulations of this city are highly worthy
of prai&s;e. The government has founded
various e&s;tabli&s;hments for public relief
and in&s;truction; among&s;t the former is
the orphan a&s;ylum, the in&s;titution for
apprenticing poor children, and fur|ni&s;hing
their parents with money, clothes,
and religious books; the ho&s;pitals for in|curables,
and al&s;o for the &s;ick and di&s;|ea&s;ed
of every religion and country.
<PB N="91" REF="98">
For the purpo&s;es of in&s;truction &s;everal
academies are &s;upported at the expence
of government, public education being
the affair of the State. Among other in|&s;titutions,
are colleges for the cla&s;sics,

in cro&s;sing mount Albis to meet
us at Zurich, having had the misfor|tune
to be thrown from his carriage,
was confined with a broken limb at
Lucerne. Though I am not permitted
to name the per&s;on to whom I allude,
tho&s;e by whom he is known will ad|mit,
that if any human being has a
claim to the &s;ympathetic duties of friend|&s;hip,
it is he who unites with all the
<PB N="93" REF="100">
higher qualities of the mind, a heart
glowing with the pure&s;t feelings of phi|lanthropy,
and more un&s;ullied by the
&s;lighte&s;t taint of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, than any
other character I have ever ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>During our &s;tay at Lucerne, we vi&s;ited
various parts of the country bordering
on the lake. The fir&s;t of our excur&s;ions
was directed towards the Canton of
Underwalden, into which we pa&s;&s;ed
acro&s;s the branch of the lake that wa&s;hes
the ba&s;e of mount Pilate, from Winkel
to Stantz&s;tad, the port belonging to the
capital of the Canton, which is the
town of Stantz.</P>
<P>This town, or rather great village, is
about two miles di&s;tant from the lake,
&s;eated amid&s;t charming meadows and
gardens, with a noble back ground of
well wooded mountains. The church is
<PB N="94" REF="101">
a fine building, &s;upported by magnificent
columns in marble; and the town-hou&s;e
is al&s;o a re&s;pectable edifice; but the
mo&s;t illu&s;trious ornament of the place
is the &s;tatue of the immortal Winkelried,
who &s;tands erect on a pede&s;tal before
the principal fountain, holding one of
the &s;pears which was gra&s;ped by &s;ome
hero in the battle of Sempach.</P>
<P>The rain had confined us for &s;ome
hours at this town, and we were fearful
that the increa&s;e of the torrents would
prevent our expedition to Engelberg;
but a gleam of &s;un&s;hine invited us to
proceed. After leaving Stantz, we pa&s;&s;ed
along a delicious valley thickly &s;own
with cottages, hamlets, and farm-hou&s;es,
agreeably &s;haded with fruit-trees. Five
miles beyond Stantz the valley clo&s;es,
and we a&s;cended the mountain three
leagues to Engelberg. Our path lay
<PB N="95" REF="102">
along a torrent &s;tream over hung by
fore&s;ts of pine, and the &s;cenery, without
pre&s;enting the &s;tupendous grandeur of
the Alps, was rich in the u&s;ual wild
and romantic appendages of Swi&s;s moun|tains.</P>
<P>Having attained the &s;ummit, we pa&s;&s;ed
by a winding de&s;cent into a valley
&s;eated within a circle of lo$ty hills,
covered with wood, or pa&s;ture; beyond
which ri&s;e the maje&s;tic chain of moun|tains,
who&s;e tops are covered with per|petual
&s;now. This valley, placed amid&s;t
a chaos of rocks and Glaciers, is about
two miles in length, and one in breadth;
in the centre are &s;ituated the village
and abbey of Engelberg. The latter is
an edifice of fine con&s;truction, particu|larly
the church, built in part with a
kind of black marble, quarries of which
are found in that country; this &s;truc|ture,
<PB N="96" REF="103">
di&s;playing the elegance of art,
forms a &s;triking contra&s;t to the &s;ur|rounding
de&s;arts of nature.</P>
<P>We arrived too late in the evening
to pre&s;ent our letters to the Abbot,
and therefore took up our re&s;idence at
the inn of the village, where, though
accu&s;tomed to mountain air and accom|modation,
we pa&s;&s;ed a night of piercing
cold, ari&s;ing probably from the re|cent
fall of rain which had thrown a
veil of &s;now over the &s;urrounding hills.</P>
<P>Early the next morning the Abbot,
who is a Prince of the Empire, &s;ent
his chancellor to invite us to repair to
the mona&s;tery, where we accompanied
him, and were introduced to a venera|ble
looking prie&s;t, who received us with
the mo&s;t cordial ho&s;pitality, kindly re|proaching
us for the late hour of our
<PB N="97" REF="104">
arrival, and lamenting, with the polite|ne&s;s
of a man of the world, that I had
been expo&s;ed to the inconveniences of
the homely inn.</P>
<P>As it was Sunday, the duties of the
morning, he informed us, compelled him
to remit his attentions towards us for a
&s;hort time, which we might employ in
viewing the library; this, however, we
deferred, and accompanied the chancel|lor
to a gallery in the church which
was crouded with villagers.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e elevated regions, beyond
which no human creature can exi&s;t,
and where nature it&s;elf &s;eems to expire,
the inhabitant of the di&s;tant mountain,
and he that dwells in &s;ome remote glen
of the valley, &s;ecluded by their &s;itua|tion
from the world, and by their daily
occupations from the &s;ociety of each
<PB N="98" REF="105">
other, hail the return of the day &s;et
apart for religious ob&s;ervances, as a double
fe&s;tival, as a means of intercour&s;e with
earth, and with heaven. The pomp
and ceremonial of the wor&s;hip mu&s;t
al&s;o be peculiarly &s;triking to the ima|gination
of the pea&s;ant, who, confined
to a nook of his native hill, has never
formed any comparative ideas of &s;plen|dour
or magnificence; and the Abbot
has rendered the &s;olemnities of the &s;er|vice
&s;till more affecting by the charm
of delightful mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>Nothing could be more congenial to
tho&s;e finer emotions of the &s;oul which
ri&s;e into devotion, than the harmonious
&s;ymphonies that thrilled upon the ear,
while the lifted eye fixed it&s;elf upon
the va&s;t per&s;pective &s;weep of &s;now-co|vered
Alps that form the &s;tupendous
horizon of the valley. In the fore|ground
<PB N="99" REF="106">
of this gigantic ma&s;s &s;tands the
bold impending mountain from which
the mona&s;tery takes its name<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Engleberg, in the language of the country, &s;igni|fies the mountain of angels. Whatever intercour&s;e his predece&s;&s;ors might have had with the&s;e heavenly me&s;&s;engers, the prince, citing a line from an epi&s;tle of Horace, declared to one of my fellow-travellers his doubts re&s;pecting this cele&s;tial con&s;ecration.</NOTE>; and on
which &s;ublime orche&s;tra, not unworthy
of the cele&s;tial choir, angels are fabled
to have tuned to their golden harps
the au&s;picious hymn of its con&s;ecra|tion.</P>
<P>The Abbot is Sovereign Lord of En|gleberg,
under the protection of the
four adjoining Cantons. The number of
his &s;ubjects, over whom he holds unli|mited
juri&s;diction, amounts to about
twelve hundred. The cares of his ex|ecutive
government devolve on four or
<PB N="100" REF="107">
five mini&s;ters and officers; and the ju|dicial
power is entru&s;ted to four judges,
whom he chu&s;es out of twelve pre|viou&s;ly
named by the people; the&s;e,
with the mini&s;ters above mentioned,
form the civil and criminal tribunals of
his &s;tate, which are held in a room of
the Abbey, and of which his chancel|lor
is &s;ecretary.</P>
<P>Such is the form of government in
this community; not indeed compo&s;ed
in the newe&s;t &s;tile of political organi|zation,
but &s;uch as from the admini&s;tra|tion
of the pre&s;ent &s;overeign, is felt as
a ble&s;sing by all who live under its in|fluence.
This prelate whom the united
voice of his people &s;tamps with the
honourable name of father of his coun|try,
has rendered tribunals civil and
criminal of little u&s;e, by cheri&s;hing in
his &s;ubjects the &s;pirit of equity and
<PB N="101" REF="108">
forbearance, and reconciling their dif|ferences
him&s;elf. The good Abbot is
not only the healer of divi&s;ions, but has
introduced a &s;y&s;tem of wealth and
comfort to the lower cla&s;&s;es by em|ploying
them in manufactures which
beguile the length and counteract the
&s;everity of the &s;avage winters.</P>
<P>This prince is a con&s;iderable manu|facturer
him&s;elf, and carries on a very
exten&s;ive commerce in chee&s;e. The
profits of his trade, and his other re|venues,
which amount to upwards of
one hundred and thirty thou&s;and livres,
are expended in acts of beneficence and
ho&s;pitality. Every wanderer has here
his claims to protection allowed, and
every vi&s;itor finds a welcome. We &s;at
down to table a numerous family,
compo&s;ed of French emigrant prie&s;ts,
the monks of the convent, and occa|&s;ional
<PB N="102" REF="109">
vi&s;itors. The table was &s;erved
with plenty and ho&s;pitality; and the
chamois, the mountain veni&s;on, made a
part of the repa&s;t; but what was mo&s;t
agreeable in the entertainment, was the
frank and courteous demeanour of the
venerable ho&s;t.</P>
<P>Among the trea&s;ures of the convent,
the library holds a di&s;tingui&s;hed place,
and is valuable not &s;o much for the
number of the volumes it contains,
which do not amount to more than
ten or twelve thou&s;and, as the rarity
and early date of the editions. The
next valuable trea&s;ure of the Abbot was
the dairy, or repo&s;itory of chee&s;es; for
we neither heard or &s;aw any thing of
tho&s;e mi&s;erable impo&s;itions on the faith
and under&s;tanding, commonly called
relicks, which had been &s;o often &s;hown
to us in catholic churches and convents
<PB N="103" REF="110">
as objects of ine&s;timable worth, compared
with which books, and even whole
magazines of chee&s;e, would weigh no|thing
in the balance. The Abbot, a
man of &s;en&s;e and literature, as well as
piety, has thought it better for the hap|pine&s;s
of his flock to &s;trengthen their
under&s;tanding, and amend their lives,
than to add to the &s;tock of their pre|judices
and follies.</P>
<P>We found the monks who formed his
&s;ociety, and the &s;tudents who receive
their education in the &s;eminary, were
lovers of the liberal arts. For the entertain|ment
of the latter, the Abbot has con|verted
a portion of the upper part of the
convent into a theatre. It was not in
a mona&s;tery, placed amid&s;t the rocks
and &s;nows of Switzerland, that we &s;hould
have expected to find a&s;&s;embled &s;o
<PB N="104" REF="111">
many of the properties of Parna&s;|&s;us.</P>
<P>I had almo&s;t forgotten to mention that
the Abbot had a private trea&s;ure &s;e|parate
from the convent, which con|&s;i&s;ted
in great varieties of artificial flow|ers,
and other elegant works, which
were &s;towed in boxes in his apart|ments.
The&s;e were the performances
of two emigrant nuns, to whom he had
given an a&s;ylum in the mona&s;tery,
and whom he re&s;cued from the pains
and penalties of idlene&s;s by this exer|ci&s;e
of their talents. A part of the&s;e
ornaments he re&s;erves for pre&s;ents to
his female vi&s;itors, the re&s;t are di&s;po&s;ed
of at Lucerne for the profit of the
arti&s;ts.</P>
<P>The mineral productions of the moun|tain
con&s;tituted another part of his
<PB N="105" REF="112">
trea&s;ure; many of the &s;pecimens were
rare and curious; as a female, the Abbot
ought to have given me a no&s;egay of
flowers, but, thinking probably the pre|&s;ent
more portable, he pre&s;ented me
with two very fine &s;pecimens of the
pure&s;t rock-chry&s;tal.</P>
<P>I &s;hould gladly have accepted the
pre&s;sing invitation of the Abbot, and
his hou&s;ehold, to pa&s;s &s;ome time at the
mona&s;tery, but one of my fellow-tra|vellers,
who is now an envoy to a
German Court, and who was then on
a private mi&s;sion from the French go|vernment
in Switzerland, had important
engagements which compelled him to
return. His pre&s;ence, indeed, occa&s;ion|ed
&s;ome little embarra&s;&s;ment to part of
the &s;ociety; the emigrants di&s;covered
him to be a Frenchman, but knew not
in what cla&s;s of emigrants he de&s;erved
<PB N="106" REF="113">
to be ranked, while, every time he
took a pinch of &s;nuff, he was careful
to &s;lide ha&s;tily into his pocket the lid
of his box, on which was painted the
emblems of liberty, and the rights of
man. French politics here, as below
in the world, were the principal topics
of conver&s;ation. The emigrants were
loud in their invectives; but the Abbot
ob&s;erved that things were returning to
order, and &s;eemed more di&s;po&s;ed to
&s;ooth the minds, and heal by gentle
coun&s;els and acts of beneficence the
rankling wounds of his gue&s;ts, than to
animate them, like &s;ome of his bre|thren
in Switzerland, to acts of de&s;pera|tion
and revenge.</P>
<P>I have dwelt &s;o long on this moun|tain
of angels, that it is high time to
de&s;cend to the world. As it was found
impo&s;sible for my fellow-travellers to
<PB N="107" REF="114">
prolong their vi&s;it, the Abbot in&s;i&s;ted
that as my engagements were not &s;o
pre&s;sing, I &s;hould be left in ho&s;tage
for their return. He promi&s;ed me books,
torrents, piny fore&s;ts, &s;nows, and Glaciers
in profu&s;ion, expeditions even towards
Tetlis, which rai&s;ed its &s;nowy head
above the valley in the cla&s;s of the
loftie&s;t mountains; and the &s;ociety of
the two French nuns, who appeared in|tere&s;ting
and amiable.</P>
<P>I found it, indeed, a difficult ta&s;k
to &s;truggle again&s;t my own wi&s;hes, and
this kind and urgent invitation; but
compounded at length with both, by
con&s;enting to return to the celebration
of the Abbot's fe&s;tival, at &s;ome weeks
di&s;tance, and &s;tay as long as he would
keep me.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="115">
This engagement I was unable to
fulfil; but if I ever return to Switzer|land,
it is not the danger of doubling
the promontory on the Lake of Lu|cerne,
which never having pa&s;&s;ed with|out
a &s;torm, I have called the promon|tory
of tempe&s;ts, or the fatigues of
the mountain-journey, that &s;hall prevent
me from climbing up to Engelberg,
and paying my re&s;pects to its venerable
Abbot.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Tell's Chapel.&mdash;Lake of Zug.&mdash;Zug.&mdash;Battle of Cappel.&mdash;
Government of Lucerne.&mdash;Literary Societies.</HEAD>
<P>WE had now vi&s;ited every part of the
Lake of the four Cantons, except the Bay
which leads to Zug. On our return from
Engelberg, we embarked to take a cur|&s;ory
view of this little Canton, pa&s;sing in
our voyage the monument erected by
Raynal to the memory of William Tell,
and the ruins of the Ca&s;tle of Hap&s;burg,
from the Counts of which name the Im|perial
Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria takes its de&s;cent.
On the neck of land that divides the
lake of Lucerne from that of Zug, is
erected a chapel on the &s;pot where Tell
pierced with his arrow the Bailiff Gei&s;ler.
To tho&s;e who think that all means again&s;t
tyrants are lawful, this &s;pot will appear
the mo&s;t &s;anctified place in Switzerland;
<PB N="110" REF="117">
and if a&s;&s;a&s;sination can be ju&s;tified in any
ca&s;e, this has perhaps the greate&s;t claims
to pardon; but the dexterous aim of the
archer is probably not the mo&s;t laudable,
though e&s;teemed one of the mo&s;t brilliant
actions of William Tell.</P>
<P>The lake of Zug, around which &startq;green
hills lift their dewy heads,&endq; would ap|pear
grand and picture&s;que to an ima|gination
not filled with the images of the
lofty-wooded &s;teeps, and dark-browed
rocks that bound the waters of Lucerne.
The town of Zug, placed near the end of
the lake, and at the foot of a mountain
covered with vines and fruit-trees, has
&s;ufficient beauty of &s;ituation to charm
the lover of nature; and its &s;ize, propor|tioned
to that of the Canton, is &s;uffi|ciently
large for the enjoyments of
&s;ociety.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="118">
The government of the Canton is de|mocratic,
like that of the other &s;mall
Cantons, with the &s;ame advantages, and
vices. Near the lake is the field where
was fought the battle of Cappel, between
the Reformers and the Catholics, in
which the latter triumphed, and where
the great enemy of the religion of their
fathers, Zuinglius, fell, fighting for the
cau&s;e of the Reformation, for which he
had &s;o zealou&s;ly contended.</P>
<P>The government of the Canton of Lu|cerne,
the chief of the Catholic Cantons,
is purely oligarchical. There is indeed a
Council of one hundred, in whom the
&s;overeignty is nominally inve&s;ted; but
the only efficient body is the &s;enate, con|&s;i&s;ting
of thirty-&s;ix members, compre|hended
in that Council; to whom be|longs
almo&s;t exclu&s;ively the exerci&s;e of
the power and authority of the State. As
<PB N="112" REF="119">
this body is hereditary, the privilege of
governing de&s;cends lineally from father
to &s;on; and no doubt whatever is ad|mitted
with re&s;pect to the clearne&s;s of
the title. No one is ra&s;h enough to di&s;|pute
the prerogatives of this privileged
cla&s;s; and the pre&s;ent generation, and
the next that &s;ucceeds it, are con&s;ecrated,
and inviolable in the eyes of every can|didate
for the rights of citizen&s;hip; who,
if by the payment of enormous &s;ums, he
happily attains that honour for him&s;elf,
mu&s;t leave the benefits to his po&s;terity
yet unborn; &s;ince it is only to the third
generation of a citizen newly elected,
that the law grants the right of being
eligible to any offices, civil or eccle|&s;ia&s;tical,
of the State. Few individuals
a&s;pire to the purcha&s;e of the&s;e di&s;tant and
uncertain advantages. He who plants a
tree may live to gather the fruit; but
the novice citizen of Lucerne knows that
<PB N="113" REF="120">
his honours will never blo&s;&s;om for him|&s;elf,
and that probably they will never
even expand for his po&s;terity.</P>
<P>The Senate being the principal ma|chine
in the State, the Grand Council is
lightened of mo&s;t of the cares of govern|ment,
by its con&s;tant labours. In all
affairs, foreign and dome&s;tic, it is the
province of the Senate to decide; and the
wi&s;dom of the Council is required, or
di&s;pen&s;ed with, according to the will of
the former. There is only one hall for
the A&s;&s;embly of both bodies; and for|merly,
when the Senate prolonged its
meetings beyond the u&s;ual hour, the
great Council waited at the door till they
were admitted. This inadvertence, it
&s;eems, has lately been corrected; but
that the di&s;tinction between &s;enators and
&s;imple coun&s;ellors may not be entirely
lo&s;t, the latter, when they &s;peak, &s;tand
<PB N="114" REF="121">
reverentially on their legs, while the
oracles of the &s;enators are delivered, like
tho&s;e of old, in a &s;itting po&s;ture.</P>
<P>By a happy confu&s;ion of powers, the
judicial authority is entru&s;ted to the &s;ame
body who form and execute the laws.
As the Senate is in lawful po&s;&s;e&s;sion, by
virtue of its office, of the titles of every
proce&s;s that is brought before its tribunal,
if the affair is important, &s;ufficient time
is allowed to this di&s;tingui&s;hed body, to
form its opinion; and as the chief is the
individual to whom the papers are &s;ent, if
he or his friends are more immediately
intere&s;ted in the deci&s;ion, the &s;ame pre|caution
is taken for the due preparation
of their opinions, before the affair is even
laid before the Senate. It is unn$ce&s;&s;ary
to ob&s;erve by what means, under &s;uch
a &s;y&s;tem, a favourable, or unfavourable
deci&s;ion may be obtained. An appeal
<PB N="115" REF="122">
may indeed be made to the great
Council; but the faith of the appellant
in the ju&s;tice of his cau&s;e mu&s;t be
&s;trong indeed, if he expects redre&s;s,
when the Senate again&s;t whom his ap|peal
is made, a&s;si&s;t in the revi&s;ion of
the ca&s;e, and u&s;ually form the majority
of the A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>While the &s;enators of Lucerne take
this tender care of the property of their
&s;ubjects, they do not neglect to pay a due
attention to their own. In mo&s;t other
countries, the client has permi&s;sion to
name the coun&s;el who is to plead his
cau&s;e before the tribunals; but here, the
paternal protection of the Senate &s;teps in
to the aid of the citizens, and prevents
all ordinary extortions of law, by ad|mitting
no other coun&s;ellors than the
&s;enators them&s;elves. At fir&s;t &s;ight, the
office of Judge and Advocate may &s;eem
<PB N="116" REF="123">
incongruous; but who ought to be better
informed of the real &s;tate of a ca&s;e than
he by whom it is to be decided? Vulgar
minds have al&s;o &s;ugge&s;ted the danger of
&s;ome bias in the heart of the Judge in
favour of his client, on account of the
fees accompanying the brief, which he
has previou&s;ly accepted, as Advocate;
but who will believe that the noble
&s;enators of Lucerne, actuated by the &s;or|did
motives of common &s;ouls, are capable
of forgetting the higher con&s;iderations
of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>No le&s;s regard is paid to the lives of
their &s;ubjects by the&s;e con&s;cript fathers,
than is &s;newn to their property. The
Gothic in&s;titutions of the Habeas Corpus
Act, and grand, or petty juries, are
here unknown. The pri&s;oner is interro|gated,
in criminal ca&s;es, by a member of
the Senate, by whom the examination
<PB N="117" REF="124">
is laid before the A&s;&s;embly, who decide
in ordinary cau&s;es; but if it is a ca&s;e
of &s;ome importance, an appeal may
be made to the grand Council. Before
the Council pa&s;s &s;entence, it is nece&s;&s;ary
that the a&s;&s;ent of the pri&s;oner to the
truth of the depo&s;ition again&s;t him &s;hould
be taken; for which purpo&s;e, the Judge
or Pre&s;ident, together with a &s;mall num|ber
of the Council, repair to the pri&s;on,
to read the charges. If the pri&s;oner ac|knowledges
the truth of the depo&s;ition,
the affair is &s;oon decided; but if he de|nies
the facts, or he&s;itates to &s;ign his con|demnation,
the in&s;truments of torture
are prepared!</P>
<P>In ju&s;tification of this practice, it is
alledged that mercy and humanity re|quire
that death, of all dreadful evils the
mo&s;t dreadful, &s;hould not be inflicted till
the la&s;t evidence of crime is obtained,
<PB N="118" REF="125">
which is the confe&s;sion of the criminal
him&s;elf. Whether death in any ca&s;e

<PB N="120" REF="127">
of men of letters devoting their
time to tho&s;e re&s;earches which were mo&s;t
likely to prove beneficial to their country,
and who, united to each other by the
tie of &s;ympathetic ta&s;te, u&s;ually pa&s;&s;ed

<P>Although the liberty of the pre&s;s, the

which will lead to freedom un&s;ullied by

<P>Trade, we are told, is under an inter|dict
at Lucerne; and the prie&s;ts are in
po&s;&s;e&s;sion of nearly half the riches of
the Canton. It is probably a bad thing
to pro&s;cribe commerce; and yet, its
wealth has communicated no &s;uperior

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Cabinets of Natural Hi&s;tory in Switzerland.&mdash;Plan of
M. Meyer.&mdash;State of fine Arts at Paris.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the curio&s;ities of Switzerland,
that merit the attention of travellers,
the cabinets of Natural Hi&s;tory hold, in
the opinion of the natives, a di&s;tingui&s;hed
rank. The hi&s;tory of the&s;e cabinets,
which belong to individuals, and are
&s;cattered in different Cantons, has been
accurately detailed by one of the Ber|noullis,
in four octavo volumes; a con|&s;iderable
and valuable mu&s;eum might be
formed of the&s;e collections, if they were
brought together for the &s;ervice of the
public.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing monuments
of topographical indu&s;try, is the plan in
relief of Switzerland, belonging to M. Meyer,
<PB N="124" REF="131">
of Arau; where we re-traced
with plea&s;ure our journies amid&s;t that
world of Glaciers on &s;ome of which no
mortal foot has trod. This plan is much
more exten&s;ive than that of General
Pffyffer, which embraces only the Cantons
around the Lake of Lucerne, while that
of M. Meyer extends, or rather is in|tended
when fini&s;hed to extend, to all
Switzerland. But what claims the un|wearied
meditation of the traveller in
Switzerland, is not the productions or
improvements of art, but the &s;tupendous
book of nature. The region where the
arts may be &s;tudied with the greate&s;t ad|vantage
is Paris.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t &s;plendid trophies of the vic|tories
obtained by the arms of the French
Republic in Italy, are the magnificent
monuments of the arts, many of which
have been tran&s;ported. or now are on
<PB N="125" REF="132">
their way, to Paris. Without pretending
to decide on the policy or the right of
the transfer, a que&s;tion which has been
amply di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, it mu&s;t be admitted that
Paris, enriched by the&s;e ma&s;ter-pieces of
genius, may now lay claim to a more ho|nourable
di&s;tinction than its former boa&s;t
of being the region of plea&s;ure, the em|porium
of elegance, and the arbiter of
fa&s;hion. Paris, arrayed in the &s;poils of
conque&s;t, is now become the centre of
human attainments. Whatever is rare or
curious in the productions of nature,
magnificent in tho&s;e of ta&s;te, inventive in
&s;cience, or precious in literature, is to be
found in Paris; and what merits the
highe&s;t eulogium is the extreme facility
of admi&s;sion, or rather the invitation
which is given to enter the&s;e receptacles
of knowledge. In&s;tead of the forbidding
in&s;cription written over the Athenian
porch, &startq;Let no unlearned per&s;on enter
<PB N="126" REF="133">
here,&endq; the reading at Paris is, &startq;Enter
all, both learned and unlearned. The
wi&s;e may add to their &s;tores of know|ledge,
and the ignorant may become
wi&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>Although the complete organization of
the e&s;tabli&s;hment of public in&s;truction
throughout the capital has not yet taken
place, the foundation is &s;ecurely laid;
and &s;urely the benevolent mind of every
country will exult in the idea of &s;o many
fellow creatures re&s;cued from vice and
&s;lavery; for &s;uch are the nece&s;&s;ary effects
of ignorance; &s;ince if knowledge, as
Bacon ob&s;erved, be power, it is al&s;o vir|tue,
freedom, and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>The di&s;&s;emination of in&s;truction is ge|neral
throughout France. Every capital
of the hundred and twenty departments
of the Republic has its Mu&s;eum, Cabinet
<PB N="127" REF="134">
of Natural Hi&s;tory, Botanic Garden, and
Philo&s;ophical Apparatus, and every Di&s;|trict
or Canton its Public Library; but at
Paris the&s;e means of knowledge are found
in &s;uch magnificent profu&s;ion, that the
only he&s;itation of the inquirer is, amid&s;t
the &s;plendid variety, what part of &s;cience
he &s;hall chu&s;e.</P>
<P>Public Libraries are open in various
parts of Paris on particular days; but the
great National Library is at all times at
the di&s;po&s;ition of the public. In that
region of books, immen&s;ely enriched by
manu&s;cripts from Italy, a multitude of
per&s;ons of both &s;exes range them&s;elves
in &s;ilence, at a long &s;uite of tables, on
which implements of writing are placed,
and where they are attended by the
officers of the library, who are bound to
furni&s;h them with the books they de|mand.
The &s;tudent of &s;cience may re|pair
<PB N="128" REF="135">
to the National Garden of Plants,
where &s;everal hundred per&s;ons attend
Lectures on Chemi&s;try, Natural Hi&s;tory,
or Botany, amid&s;t the fine&s;t &s;pecimens of
whatever is curious in either the animal,
vegetable, or mineral world. The col|lection
of living animals is not yet very
exten&s;ive; it would have been con|&s;iderably
augmented by that of the Stadt|holder,
had not a French Commi&s;&s;ary
converted his menagerie into a farm|yard,
where Indian curlews, phea&s;ants of
Java, o&s;triches, and birds of the Tropic,
after being plucked of their fine feathers,
&s;hared the fate of common poultry, and
were tru&s;&s;ed, &s;pitted, and devoured.
Happy for the camels and elephants that
they were at that time out of the reach
of the commi&s;&s;iary's cook!</P>
<P>Not long &s;ince, the fine Cabinet of
Natural Hi&s;tory contained a curious &s;pe|cimen,
<PB N="129" REF="136">
which was the &s;keleton of the
great Turenne, &s;tuck up between the
cla&s;&s;es of monkeys and alligators. At
that &s;acrilegious period when the tombs
of the illu&s;trious dead were ravaged by
tho&s;e cannibals, who, fatally for the cau&s;e
of Liberty and Science, preyed &s;o long
on the illu&s;trious living, &s;ome French|men,
penetrated with the generous feel|ing
of national pride, &s;natched from the&s;e
&s;avages the bones of this renowned Gene|ral,
and placed them among the&s;e un|couth
animals, as the &s;ure&s;t and lea&s;t
&s;u&s;pected a&s;ylum at that epoch of ho&s;ti|lity
to man.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t &s;plendid monument that
Paris contains, is the gallery of paintings
called the National Mu&s;eum. This gal|lery
is formed by the whole length of
the Louvre, which is about the third of a
mile. The exhibition was perhaps un|equalled
<PB N="130" REF="137">
when fir&s;t opened to the public,
and when it con&s;i&s;ted only of the re|union
of the ma&s;ters which were &s;cattered
through France; but &s;ince the conque&s;t
of the Flemi&s;h and Italian Schools, it
may be &s;aid to contain almo&s;t the whole
of what is great or celebrated in the
Hi&s;tory of the Arts.</P>
<P>The de&s;cription of the far-famed pieces
which it now exhibits, already fills the
volumes of travellers, who have thought
the view of the&s;e precious relicks well
worth a pilgrimage to the &s;eparate &s;hrines
where they were placed; but henceforth
that cla&s;s of travellers whom Sterne de|&s;cribes
as failing and po&s;ting through the
politer kingdoms of the globe, in order to
&s;ee &s;ights and look into di&s;coveries, will
have an ea&s;ier ta&s;k to perform: they need
only journey as far as this va&s;t Mu&s;eum,
and run along the double rows of its
<PB N="131" REF="138">
gallery, hung thick with Raphaels,
Michael Angelos, Carraccis, Titians, Cor|regios,
Guidos, Rubens, Claude Lorraines,
and Ro&s;as. Tho&s;e who are ambitious
of pa&s;sing for connoi&s;&s;eurs, may here
learn, with little trouble, all the terms
of cogno&s;centi, and, like the director of
ta&s;te in the Vicar of Wakefield, never
want rea&s;ons for prai&s;ing the works of
Pietro Perugino.</P>
<P>The real lover of the arts will find
ample gratification in contemplating the&s;e
&s;ublime monuments of genius, this rich
a&s;&s;emblage of its collected powers! And
if the luxury of &s;uch &s;en&s;ations is di&s;|turbed
by the ignorant comments of the
vulgar, he may, by an application &s;eldom
refu&s;ed, &s;hare the privileged hours of the
&s;tudent, and indulge his feelings in the
calm of &s;ilent meditation.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="139">
The middle part of this exten&s;ive gal|lery
is at pre&s;ent occupied by pieces of
Sculpture. For tho&s;e, as well as the mo|numents
now in their way from Italy
(among which is the Apollo Belvidere) the
Ground Gallery of the Louvre, which lies
under that of Painting, is in forward pre|paration.
This Gallery of Sculpture will
not be le&s;s brilliant than its &s;i&s;ter Gallery
above. The French School has been long
celebrated for the chi&s;el; and the monu|ments
of its labours are heaped in great
profu&s;ion in various repo&s;itories of Paris.
The&s;e pieces are now to be collected to|gether
in this part of the Mu&s;eum, of
which the Italian bu&s;ts and &s;tatues will
form a &s;plendid ornament.</P>
<P>While the&s;e delicate and more e&s;timable
monuments are carefully protected from
the injuries of the &s;ea&s;ons, the Govern|ment
has decorated the Public Gardens
<PB N="133" REF="140">
with numerous fine copies of the mo&s;t
celebrated antique, and the Tuilleries
are become a walk no le&s;s agreeable to
the amateurs, than to the fa&s;hionable
world; and a further plan of embelli&s;h|ment
is propo&s;ed, by forming a covered
Winter Garden in the Orange-walk, de|corated
with hot-hou&s;e plants, and dif|fu&s;ing
the temperature of Spring. A re|generated
&s;tatue of Liberty will be
erected on the Place of Concord, for|merly
Place de Louis XV. and a column
of Victory three hundred feet in height,
crowned by a colo&s;&s;al &s;tatue of Fame,
will be placed at the end of the Vi&s;ta
leading from the Tuilleries.</P>
<P>Various in&s;titutions are formed for the
progre&s;s of knowledge in France, among
which the Polytechnical School claims a
di&s;tingui&s;hed place. Of the&s;e in&s;titutions,
and of all that concerns the &s;ciences, the
<PB N="134" REF="141">
members of the National In&s;titute are the
guardians. Unlike mo&s;t of the learned
&s;ocieties of Europe, which confine them|&s;elves
almo&s;t exclu&s;ively to one branch of
&s;cience, the In&s;titute is divided into
cla&s;&s;es, which comprehend every depart|ment
of human knowledge. The pe&s;ti|lential
reign of terrori&s;m has &s;wept away
many who would have been among its
mo&s;t illu&s;trious ornaments; but the num|ber
left is not incon&s;iderable of tho&s;e
who would do honour to any age or
country. A certain portion of the re|venue
of the State is appropriated to the
&s;ervice of the In&s;titute, who&s;e members
receive a recompen&s;e for their labours,
which is neither adequate to their dig|nity,
nor that of the Republic. This
narrow &s;tipend will no doubt be aug|mented
at the peace; and the Republic
will pay more liberally the debt &s;he owes
to Literature, the parent of her exi&s;tence.
<PB N="135" REF="142">
The Government has indeed ob&s;erved the
mo&s;t re&s;pectful attention towards this
learned body from its fir&s;t in&s;titution;
and this homage, rendered to Science by
Power, is among the mo&s;t plea&s;ing fea|tures
of its admini&s;tration.</P>

<P>WE had con&s;ecrated the &s;ummer

to the months of Autumn the view of
the milder land&s;capes of that enchant|ing

cea&s;es to overwhelm the imagination
with her greatne&s;s, a&s;&s;umes the &s;ofte&s;t

&s;een but an incon&s;iderable part of the
Canton of Berne, and none of the de|licious
countries wa&s;hed by the lake of
Geneva, and which are e&s;teemed by

<Q>&startq;Fallen into the &s;ear, the yellow leaf;&endq;</Q>

and after &s;pending two or three weeks
at Ba&s;il on our return from Lucerne, we
once more cro&s;&s;ed the mountains of
Jura. The la&s;t time we a&s;cended tho&s;e
romantic &s;teeps, they were dre&s;&s;ed in
all the rich gradations of colouring
which belong to Autumn. The
deep brown, and pale yellow, which
over&s;pread in their various tints the fo|liage
of the wooded cliffs, contra&s;ted
with the fre&s;h ever-green of the groves
of pine and fir, and the bright verdure
which &s;till covered the pa&s;toral lawns.
The rills &s;eemed to flow in clearer cur|rents;
there was a &s;ort of &s;pirit in the
air, and the whole &s;cenery mingling
gay and luxuriant graces, with fading
forms, excited that &s;oft and &s;oothing
melancholy which, to &s;ome minds, is
<PB N="138" REF="145">
&s;o much dearer than all that the world
calls plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The town of Soleure, &s;ituated on the
Aar, in a beautiful and fertile coun|try,
contains &s;everal fine edifices, of
which the new built church in the
principal &s;treet, ornamented with two
&s;uperb fountains in front, is the mo&s;t
di&s;tingui&s;hed. The town is fortified,
and appears &s;ufficiently &s;trong to keep
out an army of revolted pea&s;antry, the
only purpo&s;e to which &s;ortifications in
Switzerland have for two or three cen|turies
pa&s;t been applied.</P>
<P>At the gate we were compelled to
undergo a long ceremonial of exami|nation,
and were referred from one
committee of guards to another before
we were &s;uffered to enter, though our
pa&s;&s;ports were in perfect order, and bore no
<PB N="139" REF="146">
mi&s;chievous traces of intelligence with
France. We had been previou&s;ly told,
that per&s;ons coming from that country,
except &s;uch as came without pa&s;&s;ports,
had in this town been &s;ubjected to in|&s;ult,
and even danger; nor were we
&s;urprized at this intelligence, having
heard from M. Barthelemy him&s;elf the
mode of his expul&s;ion from the accu&s;|tomed
re&s;idence of the French amba&s;|&s;adors
at Soleure.</P>
<P>The government of this Canton is an
oligarchy, like that of Lucerne, com|po&s;ed
of a council of one hundred and
one, including the thirty-five members
of the &s;enate who form the executive
power. There is &s;omething liberal in
the exerci&s;e of privilege in this Canton
compared with that of Lucerne; here
the places of honour or profit are di&s;|tributed
among&s;t thirty families, while
<PB N="140" REF="147">
at Lucerne the influence and principal
offices of the State are confined to ten
or twelve.</P>
<P>Although Soleure had relaxed &s;ome|thing
of the &s;everity of its features to|wards
France &s;ince the retreat of the
coale&s;eed armies acro&s;s the Rhine, and
the arrival of the Pru&s;sian envoy at
Ba&s;il to treat of peace, there was yet
no &s;uch demon&s;tration of the return of
the old cordiality as could make even
a &s;light re&s;idence agreeable to tho&s;e
who were friends to the cau&s;e of li|berty;
and remaining but a &s;ufficient
time to view the city, and its charm|ing
environs, we continued our journey
to Bienne.</P>
<P>On the road to Bienne, which lies
along the foot of the Jura, we beheld
one of the grande&s;t views which Swit|zerland
<PB N="141" REF="148">
had yet pre&s;ented to our ad|miration.
In mo&s;t of its Cantons &s;ome
&s;nowy mountain forms the background
of the picture; but here we &s;aw di&s;|played
in all their maje&s;ty the whole
chain of Alps from St. Gothard to the
Lake of Geneva; forming one va&s;t world
of Glaciers, behind who&s;e towering
peaks Mount Blanc reared its augu&s;t
and &s;ublime&s;t head. Although but at
the di&s;tance of fifty or &s;ixty miles, we
were &s;o placed that the eye could take
in at one view this mighty range of
mountain. The &s;un lighted up the hills
by which we were &s;eparated from the
chain of Alps long after its &s;etting orb had
&s;unk behind Mount Jura from our view;
but the &s;hadowy gradations of twilight
had fallen both on hill and valley,
when the mo&s;t vivid hue of the ro&s;e
from every alpine peak reflected the
&s;olar beams, and flu&s;hed the wide he|mi&s;phere
<PB N="142" REF="149">
with one bright tint of &s;plen|dour.</P>
<P>Bienne is a neat &s;mall town, &s;ituated
near the lake which bears its name,
celebrated in modern &s;tory as having
been the retreat of Rou&s;&s;eau, who lived
for &s;ome time on the i&s;land of St.
Pierre, and was compelled, at length,
to &s;eek refuge in Paris from the per|&s;ecution
of the Republics of Switzer|land.
The French Government, in right
of the po&s;&s;e&s;sion of the Bi&s;hoprick of
Ba&s;il, now the department of Mount
Terrible, is Sovereign of the State of
Bienne; but as objects of more impor|tance
at that time occupied its attention,
the great and little councils to whom
the admini&s;tration of State affairs be|longs
of right, took care al&s;o, during
the inter-regnum, of the Sovereignty.
The Mayor of the town is the repre|&s;entative
<PB N="143" REF="150">
of this Sovereign, who&s;e power
is merely nominal, and who&s;e revenues
are &s;carcely more than &s;ufficient to
pay the &s;alary of his trea&s;urer. The
legi&s;lative power of the State is entru&s;ted
to the great council, the little council
wield the &s;eeptre; and, as in ca&s;e of
vacancies, the&s;e two bodies name the
&s;ucceeding members, the government is
purely ari&s;tocratical.</P>
<P>It was our good fortune to alight at
an inn of which the ma&s;ter, Mr. Wizard,
is great coun&s;ellor and trea&s;urer of the
State. The company at Mr. Wizard's
table, which was well furni&s;hed, con|&s;i&s;ted
of &s;enators of Bienne, and French
emigrants. Mr. Wizard was deeply
&s;killed in the political affairs of Europe;
and in&s;inuated, that had his advice been
followed, matters would have been dif|ferently
arranged between the Swi&s;s

when every power in Europe
was coale&s;ced again&s;t the French Repub|lic,
the town of Bienne took her by

want of a&s;si&s;tance.&endq; As Mr. Wizard
proclaimed the&s;e opinions before emi|grants
and Engli&s;h, there could be no
hypocri&s;y in his &s;entiments; nor can
there be any impropriety in this te&s;ti|mony
to his zeal.</P>
<P>No doubt, had his advice in favour
of the French Republic been followed,
he would have given his vote with
<PB N="145" REF="152">
alacrity for the augmentation of her
military force by the contingent of
Bienne, which, I believe, amounts to
fourteen men.</P>
<P>The journals of travellers in Switzer
land are filled with complaints of
heavy impo&s;itions at the inns, nor do
they murmur without cau&s;; but the
&s;entiments of Mr. Wizard are, no doubt,
elevated in proportion to his rank; he
&s;corns to impo&s;e upon the traveller,
and his hou&s;e is one of the cheape&s;t
as well as the be&s;t in all Switzerland.
In making this declaration, I only add
my feeble te&s;timony to that of a di&s;|tingui&s;hed
croud, who&s;e names were
contained in two enormous packets
which he produced in order to &s;hew
me how many of my countrymen had
been his gue&s;ts. Each per&s;on at his
departure had left a little certificate,
<PB N="146" REF="153">
&s;tating that he who &s;igned it was per|fectly
&s;ati&s;fied with Mr. Wizard.</P>
<P>Old and young, patricians and plebeians,
lords and commons, were all &s;atisfied
with Mr. Wizard; this was the burden
of the &s;ong from per&s;ons of all coun|tries
and conditions; I never remember
to have met with &s;o many uniform
opinions on the &s;ame &s;ubject. We had
examined a multitude of the&s;e te&s;timo|nies,
when Mr. Wizard, pa&s;sing ha&s;tily
over Counts, Dukes and Princes, &s;natched
up eagerly a &s;crap of paper which he
exclaimed was a certificate that he
would not lo&s;e for twenty louis. From
the glow on the countenance of Mr.
Wizard, and the energy with which he
&s;poke, I gue&s;&s;ed that it was at lea&s;t
the tribute of an Emperor. &startq;There,&endq;
added he, throwing it with a look of
triumph on the table, &startq;there is the
<PB N="147" REF="154">
name of the fir&s;t man in Europe.&endq;
We looked to di&s;cover who was thus
elevated in our ho&s;t's opinion, and read,
with that &s;ort of per&s;onal pride which we
feel in tho&s;e powers of genius that give di&s;|tinction
to our own country, the &s;ig|nature
of Charles Fox.</P>
<P>From the &s;overeignty of the French
Republic, we pa&s;&s;ed in a few hours
through a charming country, into that
of the King of Pru&s;sia; the re&s;pective
&s;ubjects of the&s;e two Powers were living
in good harmony with each other in
Switzerland, while their fellow-&s;ubjects
on the Rhine were employed in mutual
&s;laughter.</P>
<P>Neufchatel is plea&s;antly &s;ituated on
an ample lake, of which the waters,
agitated by a &s;torm, were flu&s;hed with
deep tints of green and purple. This
<PB N="148" REF="155">
town forms part of the dominions of
the Pru&s;sian monarch, but from the
privileges which it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, is exempted
from engaging in any projects ho&s;tile
to its own opinions or intere&s;t. The
government of the town and di&s;trict is
a confu&s;ion of powers not well defined;
but it would appear from the indu&s;try
and opulence of the inhabitants, com|pared
with many other parts of Swit|zerland&punc;
together with the works that
i&s;&s;ued from the pre&s;&s;es of Neu&s;chatel
during the French monarchy, that
Pru&s;sian de&s;poti&s;m did not weigh on
them with too heavy an hand. Since
the celebrated controver&s;y, which aro&s;e
between Petit-pierre and his bre|thren

in which opinion the former was &s;up|ported
by Frederick the Great, no

<PB N="149" REF="156">

and Mar&s;hal Keith, with their doctrine
of final &s;alvation, were, after long di&s;|cu&s;sion,
obliged to quit the field; the
clergy maintained their privileges, and
the King declared that &startq;pui&s;qu'ils

<P>AFTER making various excur&s;ions round

At Avenches, the cla&s;sic ground of
Switzerland, we went to &s;ee the te&s;&s;elated
pavement, which was &s;hewn to us by a
pea&s;ant, who has the charge of this relick
of antiquity, or rather of the tobacco|leaves
which over&s;pread it; for there
they remain, in &s;pite of the ju&s;t re|mon&s;trances
of Mr. Cox. Every pa&s;sing
&s;tranger may take up as many fragments
as &s;uits his humour of this curious pave|ment,
which, in a country of ta&s;te, would
be pre&s;erved with religious care. We
al&s;o vi&s;ited the remains of the Amphi|theatre
in the Baili&s;&s;'s Garden, the marble
pillar, and other monuments which de|note
the former grandeur of the Capital
of antient Helvetia. Similar monuments
have been di&s;covered in the neighbour|hood
of the lake of Neufchatel, particu|larly
at Cheyres.</P>
<P>From Avenches, we proceeded to Mou|don,
which was the antient capital of
<PB N="153" REF="160">
the Pays de Vaud, before it fell under
the dominion of the Canton of Berne,
At pre&s;ent it only &s;erves to yield a re|venue
to &s;ome Sovereign Burgher of
Berne, who, under the name of Baili&s;&s;,
lives in a fine chateau, which, perched
on a rock, rai&s;es its &s;piral towers at
Larchens, about a league from Moudon,
and which once belonged to the dig|nitaries
of the Pays de Vaud. Wherever
we met with palaces or ca&s;tles in this
country, it was unnece&s;&s;ary to inquire
to whom they belonged, &s;ince the in|habitant
never failed to be a Bailiff of
the &s;overeign Canton of Berne.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome days in the Pays de
Vaud, which, rich in charming pa&s;to|ral
&s;cenery, &s;loping lawns, embowering
groves, and lovely cultivated hills,
crowned with the bare peak of a wooded
cliff, half-veiled by clu&s;tering foliage, re|minded
<PB N="154" REF="161">
me of the mo&s;t beautiful parts
of England. The Pays de Vaud is not
only enchanting, in its &s;oft per&s;pectives,
to the lover of nature, but fertile in every
production for the &s;upport or enjoyment
of life. In &s;uch a country, De&s;poti&s;m
it&s;elf could &s;carcely weigh heavy enough
with its iron hand, to cru&s;h the inhabitant
beneath oppre&s;sion. The fruitfulne&s;s of
the &s;oil keeps pace with the exactions of
avarice; and the &s;ubject-pea&s;ant, though
robbed of his rights, finds &s;ome compen&s;a|tion
in the bounty of nature. We left the&s;e
Arcadian Vales, and a&s;cended the chain
of hills that encircle the Lake of Geneva;
where, in &s;trong contra&s;t to the mild
picture of the Pays de Vaud, we gazed
once more on rocks and mountains,
rudely hanging over the oppo&s;ite banks of
the lake, and who&s;e tops were whitened
by new-fallen &s;now. In the back ground
ro&s;e the Alps, covered with their un|varied
<PB N="155" REF="162">
&s;hroud. As we de&s;cended the hills,
we beheld the &s;pacious Lake &s;tretching
its ample waters along the ba&s;e of this
ridge of mountains, far as the eye could
reach; and our path to Lau&s;anne, leading
along vine-covered hills, and di&s;playing
at one view the luxuriant charms of
beauty, and the awful wildne&s;s of terrific
grandeur, furni&s;hed all tho&s;e combina|tions
of imagery which eroud the dreams
of the poet.</P>
<P>Probably no town of Europe is better
&s;ituated than Lau&s;anne to delight the
traveller by its picture&s;que views, or more
inconveniently placed for a con&s;tant re|&s;idence.
This town is, for the mo&s;t part,
either aby&s;s or mountain; the &s;treets
communicate with each other by long
flights of &s;teps, down which you de&s;cend
into what was formerly a ravin, in order
to a&s;cend, on the other &s;ide, what mu&s;t
<PB N="156" REF="163">
once have been a precipice. Since many
other &s;pots might have been cho&s;en for
a city, either nearer the lake for the
&s;ake of commerce, or higher up for de|fence,
it &s;eems &s;trange that the foundati|ons
&s;hould have been laid in a place above
all others the lea&s;t &s;ituated for habitual
accommodation. We found Lau&s;anne
filled with emigrants from France, and
al&s;o from Geneva, the Jacobins of that
Republic having, at the clo&s;e of the reign
of Robe&s;pierre, perpetrated &s;ome of tho&s;e
atrocious acts which had &s;o long de&s;o|lated
France.</P>
<P>The Republic of Geneva, by a general
in&s;urrection in the beginning of 1789,
had thrown off the chains which a de|&s;potic
magi&s;tracy, &s;even years before,
aided by the combined armies of France,
Berne, and Sardinia, had impo&s;ed on
their fellow citizens. Although, in this
<PB N="157" REF="164">
in&s;tance, &s;he &s;poke the prologue to the
drama of the French Revolution, which
happened &s;ome months after, &s;he has
&s;ince never failed to play the after-piece
to all its eventful tran&s;itions.</P>
<P>Of five cla&s;&s;es of inhabitants belonging
to Geneva, two only, tho&s;e of Citizens
and Burghers, compo&s;ed the Sovereign
A&s;&s;embly, improperly called, &startq;General
Council.&endq;&mdash;The cla&s;&s;es of natives, in|habitants,
and hou&s;e-keepers, enjoyed no
political rights; the&s;e were the preroga|tives
only of the two former. It may be
ea&s;ily conceived that tho&s;e three un|privileged
cla&s;&s;es could not behold with
indifference the e&s;tabli&s;hment and con|&s;olidation
of the French Revolution.
They viewed its progre&s;s at fir&s;t with
&s;ecret exultation, as a &s;ure pre&s;age of
their own; and a &s;ociety at length was
formed of the partizans of the new
<PB N="158" REF="165">
&s;y&s;tem, under the name of the Circle of
Equality. The views of this &s;ociety were
altogether directed towards the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment
of the ju&s;t principles of liberty, in
de&s;pite of the oppo&s;ition of the citizens,
in whom the exclu&s;ive &s;overeignty was
ve&s;ted, and al&s;o of &s;uch of the un|privileged
cla&s;&s;es as were attached to the
exi&s;ting government from different cir|cum&s;tances,
or who had nothing to gain
by a change. The demands of the&s;e ad|vocates
for Equal Rights had hitherto
been only whi&s;pered; but when the
inva&s;ion of Savoy had taken place, at the
clo&s;e of the fir&s;t campaign, in 1792, the
neighbourhood of the Republican army
to Geneva emboldened the&s;e patriots to
make remon&s;trances which had the air
of authority, if not of menace. The
great, and little councils, finding that
a refu&s;al or even delay under &s;uch circum|&s;tances
would be attended with con|&s;iderable
<PB N="159" REF="166">
danger, appeared to be con|vinced
by the arguments of the peti|tioners,
and pa&s;&s;ed a decree in favour of
Equal Rights, with certain &s;light re&s;tric|tions;
and in order to give this decree
the &s;anction of the con&s;titutional form,
they framed a &s;ketch of a law which was
to be &s;ubmitted to the General Council.
This preamble gave great offence to the
friends of Equality, who were unwilling
to receive as a gift what they felt was
their right. The two parties immediately
became exa&s;perated again&s;t each other.
The Genevois who dreaded a Revolu|tion,
being more numerous than tho&s;e
who wi&s;hed it, &s;olicited the commander
of the military force to beat to arms, and
ring the alarm-bell, in order to awe their
adver&s;aries into &s;ilence. The Syndic
of the Guard, Mr. Micheli Ducre&s;t, to
avoid the effu&s;ion of blood, refu&s;ed to
comply with this requi&s;ition; he not
<PB N="160" REF="167">
only invited the partizans of the govern|ment,
who were on guard at their po&s;ts
in the city, to retire to their homes, but
put into the hands of the leaders of the
friends to Equal Rights the keys of the
Park of Artillery. They were not tardy
in taking advantage of this important ac|qui&s;ition.
On the I&s;t of December they
made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the place,
the Red Cap was hoi&s;ted, Trees of Liberty
were planted in different quarters of the
town, on the 5th the Revolution was
completed, and the triumphant party
named forty &s;elect men, in order to or|ganize
the new &s;y&s;tem. On the 12th
of December, the Anniver&s;ary of the
E&s;caladi of 1602, Political Equality was
proclaimed in the General Council; and,
the 28th of the &s;ame month, the di&s;|mi&s;&s;al
of the great and little councils, pro|mulgated
in the name of the Deputies
of the Nation, made way for two pro|vi&s;ional
<PB N="161" REF="168">
committees, with the names of
Committees of Safety, and Admini&s;tra|tion;
which election was confirmed, the
la&s;t day of the year, by a &s;overeign
a&s;&s;embly, compo&s;ed of both the old and
newly-admitted citizens.</P>
<P>The Revolution being effected, the Ge|nevois
were anxious to confirm it by a
con&s;titution purely democratic. A Na|tional
A&s;&s;embly, compo&s;ed of one hun|dred
and twenty members, cho&s;en among
the citizens of both parties, opened the
&s;e&s;sion the 25th of February, 1793. At
the clo&s;e of the year, the plan of the
con&s;titution was printed, and &s;ubmitted
to the con&s;ideration of the people, and,
on the 5th of February, 1794, was ac|cepted
by the citizens a&s;&s;embled in &s;ove|reign
council. This con&s;titutional edict,
founded on the great principles of liberty,
con&s;ecrated the rights of man, the di|vi&s;ion
<PB N="162" REF="169">
of power, and the re&s;pon&s;ibility of
office, and though defective in many re|&s;pects,
and formed rather for a wealthy,
exten&s;ive &s;tate, than a &s;mall and circum|&s;cribed
republic, was gladly received by
the great ma&s;s of the people. The Gene|vois
were anxious for the e&s;tabli&s;hment
of a government which &s;hould protect
their per&s;ons and properties, an advan|tage
of which both parties had not had
an equal enjoyment under the <HI>Pro|vi&s;ionary
Regime,</HI> where many acts of pil|lage,
cruelty, and even murder, had re|mained
unpuni&s;hed through the weak|ne&s;s
or connivance of tho&s;e in power.
The new authorities who entered on
office the 13th of April, were acknow|ledged
by the governments of Berne and
Zurich, who had refu&s;ed to corre&s;pond
with the provi&s;ional committees; the
magi&s;trates were re&s;pected, the prejudices
and hatred of the different parties ap|peared
<PB N="163" REF="170">
to be extinct, and order and har|mony
completely re&s;tored, when this
happy &s;tate of calm and tranquillity was
di&s;turbed by the in&s;urrection of the 19th
of July, and the &s;cenes to which it gave
birth.</P>
<P>The preceding evening, in a numerous
&s;itting of the general Club of the Revo|lutioni&s;ts,
&s;ome of the leaders of the
party announced a con&s;piracy formed
again&s;t the Patriots, by the <HI>Ari&s;tocrates,</HI>
and the <HI>Englu&eacute;s</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The name given to tho&s;e per&s;ons who had taken no part in the Revolution.</NOTE>. On hearing this de|nunciation,
the mo&s;t furious of the party
moved for an immediate call to arms, in
order to cru&s;h the con&s;piracy, and puni&s;h
the traitors, while tho&s;e who were more
moderate, contended that the meeting of
the &s;overeign council, which was to a&s;|&s;emble
<PB N="164" REF="171">
the next day to decide on im|po&s;ing
&s;ome urgent taxes, ought not to
be di&s;turbed by &s;uch a &s;udden, and pro|bably
ill-founded alarm. While the Pre|&s;ident
was putting the que&s;tion, about
thirty of the mo&s;t vehement members
ran furiou&s;ly out of the hall, calling to
arms, which gave an impul&s;e to others,
and the whole tumultuou&s;ly put them|&s;elves
in in&s;urrection.</P>
<P>Before day-break, revolutionary patroles
had filled the &s;treets, made domiciliary
vi&s;its, and arre&s;ted tho&s;e of the <HI>Ari&s;tocrates,</HI>
and the <HI>Englu&eacute;s,</HI> who were the mo&s;t
&s;u&s;pected. During the morning, the in|&s;urgents
made a proclamation, enjoining
every revolutioni&s;t to arm for the &s;afety
of the country, and his own; the meet|ing
of the &s;overeign council was de|ferred,
the &s;eals were put on the effects
and papers of many citizens, who were
<PB N="165" REF="172">
impri&s;oned or ab&s;ent, various depreda|dations
were committed in the hou&s;es
of individuals, both in the town and
country; and all tho&s;e who had taken no
part in the Revolution were di&s;armed.</P>
<P>The revolutionary clubs, who corre|&s;ponded
at that time with the Jacobin
Society in France, and who had caught
the contagion of their &s;pirit, named a
military commi&s;sion, compo&s;ed of &s;even
members, to organize the in&s;urrection,
leaving every civil concern under the
direction of the con&s;titutional laws, and
the legal authorities. The gates of the
city were in&s;tantly &s;hut, divine wor&s;hip
was &s;u&s;pended, and many of its mini&s;ters,
re&s;pectable for their age and &s;ervices,
were dragged to hou&s;es of confinement,
where more than five hundred of their
fellow citizens were heaped together
during the mo&s;t &s;everi&s;h heat of &s;ummer.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="173">
On the demand of the military com|mittee,
the in&s;urrectionary clubs formed
a revolutionary tribunal compo&s;ed of
twenty-one members to try the pri|&s;oners;
but the &s;entence of death could
not be put into execution till confirmed
by the majority of the revolutioni&s;ts.
The tribunal &s;at publicly in one of the
halls of the Hotel de Ville, and brought
fir&s;t to the bar tho&s;e of the pri&s;oners
who were enregi&s;tered under the deno|mination
of the chief criminals, &s;even
of whom were condemned to die. In
conformity to this decree, the revolu|tioni&s;ts
a&s;&s;embled in arms in one of the
public walks of the city called the
National Lyceum, to &s;anction, or annul
in whole, or in part, the &s;entence of
the tribunal. The leaders expelled from
this a&s;&s;embly every per&s;on who was not
known for a decided revolutioni&s;t, and,
after this epuration, gave their votes by
<PB N="167" REF="174">
white and black balls, the former of
which denoted an acquittal, and the
latter death. Three of tho&s;e who were
condemned by the tribunal were &s;aved
by this operation; but as they were
members of patrician families, and had
held the fir&s;t places in the State, &s;e|veral
of the revolutioni&s;ts, heated by
wine which had been plentifully la|vi&s;hed
on the occa&s;ion, exclaimed in a
rage, that there was a plot to &s;ave
the ari&s;tocrats who ought all to peri&s;h.
Whil&s;t others more moderate were en|deavouring
to &s;ilence, or per&s;uade them,
that they ought to yield to the deci&s;ion o
the majority, a group of the mo&s;t &s;avage
among&s;t them withdrew from the ranks,
and ran to the pri&s;ons to &s;eize the &s;even
victims, whom they brought <HI>au pas de
charge</HI> into the fatal circle. The mo|derate
party were, by this time, con|&s;iderably
dimini&s;hed; a &s;quare battalion
<PB N="168" REF="175">
was formed; the tribunal placed in the

on this occa&s;ion, becau&s;e at the

the clubs had decided that no further

ended its &s;ittings, after having con|demned
thirty-&s;even per&s;ons to death,
of which, twenty-&s;ix were ab&s;ent; an
hundred to bani&s;hment; about three
hundred to impri&s;onment; &s;ome for
life; others for different terms, and
the remainder were di&s;charged with a
few revolutionary admonitions.</P>
<P>One of the cau&s;es of the in&s;urrection
had been the want of money: the
reign of terror came in aid of the ex|hau&s;ted
finances, and the indigent jaco|bins.
When the clubs named the mem|bers
of the tribunal, they cho&s;e al&s;o a
revolutionary commi&s;sion which de|clared
<PB N="170" REF="177">
null and void every Notorial Act
pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince the 18th July; &s;eque&s;tered
the goods of tho&s;e who were impri&s;oned,
or who being ab&s;ent, were found guilty;
forbade the export of coin, goods, or
plate; decreed that all &s;ilver furniture
&s;hould be carried to the Mint; that
every per&s;on &s;hould declare the &s;tate of
his fortune; that heavy contributions
&s;hould be levied on the ari&s;tocrats;
others le&s;s exorbitant on the <HI>Englou&eacute;s,</HI>
and &s;ome &s;till more moderate on the
rich Patriots. The produce of the&s;e
taxes and &s;eizures were employed for
the mo&s;t part to &s;alary the revolutioni&s;ts
who had &s;upported the in&s;urrection,
the members of the military committee
of the tribunal and revolutionary com|mi&s;sion.
While the commi&s;sion was de|ciding
on, and levying the contributions
which the in&s;urgents had declared due
<PB N="171" REF="178">
to the country by the enemies of the
revolution, it changed its financial occu|pations
into functions far more dreadful,
and a &s;econd revolutionary tribunal was
&s;oon after erected. For more than a
year pa&s;t a popular &s;ociety under the
name of <HI>&startq;Mountaineers, Centinels of Li|berty,&endq;</HI>
had been formed at Geneva: the
views of the leaders in this &s;ociety were
to de&s;troy the con&s;tituted authorities,
and to di&s;organize the revolution: a
plan was di&s;tributed in the name of
the&s;e Mountaineers, and among&s;t the
different popular &s;ocieties, containing
among&s;t other propo&s;itions, that of ar|re&s;ting
all tho&s;e citizens who had com|po&s;ed
the Geneve&s;e authorities from
the 28th December, 1792, to the pre|&s;ent
period: this project included va|rious
cla&s;&s;es, from the fir&s;t merchant
to the lowe&s;t trade&s;man; the&s;e ultra|revolutionary
propo&s;itions alarmed the
<PB N="172" REF="179">
revolutioni&s;ts, who immediately &s;hut up
the club of Mountaineers, impri&s;oned
the leaders, and put the re&s;t of the
members under arre&s;t at their own
hou&s;es. The Patriots then ordered the
revolutionary commi&s;sion to form it&s;elf
into a revolutionary tribunal, and to do
ju&s;tice to the enemies of independence,
the &s;actions of anarchy, the ari&s;tocrats
and <HI>Englou&eacute;s</HI> who had e&s;caped the vi|gilance
of the former tribunal. The
fir&s;t who appeared at the bar of this
new tribunal, were the Anarchi&s;ts, and
enemies of independence, leaders in the
in&s;urrection of the 19th of July; four
of whom, after being heard in their
defence, were condemned to death as
traitors to their country; a few mem|bers
of the Mountaineer-&s;ociety were
&s;entenced to perpetual bani&s;hment;
others to the &s;ame puni&s;hment for dif|ferent
periods; &s;ome were deprived of
<PB N="173" REF="180">
their political rights, and the greate&s;t
number, who had only been mi&s;led,
were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with a fraternal admo|nition.
At this period a <HI>national com|mi&s;sion</HI>
was formed; the revolutionary com|mi&s;sion
was di&s;&s;olved, and was &s;ucceeded
by a <HI>commi&s;sion of liquidation,</HI> which un|dertook
to weigh the pur&s;es of the
Genevois, and tax them according to
their weight, and the political opinions
of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the country, who
had &s;een nothing in the Revolution of
1792, but an exemption from taxes, re|fu&s;ed
with ob&s;tinate per&s;everance to pay
any contribution, and concluded with
giving little. A revolt in the garri&s;on of
the town was appea&s;ed, and puni&s;hed
by the breaking of two companies of
cannoneers. Commerce, di&s;engaged by
degrees from revolutionary requi&s;itions,
<PB N="174" REF="181">
re&s;umed a free cour&s;e; a part of the pro|duce
of the extraordinary taxes was u&s;e|fully
applied to patriotic e&s;tabli&s;hments,
to the advancement of the &s;ciences and
arts, and the encouragement of literature.
All the titles of former citizen&s;hip, all
the parchments of the privileged orders,
were publicly burnt on the day of the
national fe&s;tival; and the petitions of
numbers of citizens pre&s;ented to the revo|lutionary
clubs to obtain a revi&s;ion of
their judgment, were favourably heard,
and ju&s;tice became, as in France, once
more the order of the day.</P>
<P>Geneva, true to its prototype, as &s;oon
as France had formed a con&s;titution,
formed or changed its con&s;titution al&s;o;
in which, however, there is this &s;ingular
di&s;tinction, that, whil&s;t a catholic coun|try,
France, admits partizans of every
religion, the Jew, Mahometan, and Pro|te&s;tant,
<PB N="175" REF="182">
to an equal participation of rights,
the Genevan &s;auts the door &s;ternly again&s;t
Catholics, and &s;hrinks almo&s;t from its
liberality in having admitted the follower
of $word$. This narrow &s;pirit of bigotry
is confined to the lower cla&s;&s;es of the
people; and the attempts hitherto made
by its more enlightened citizens to change
the opinion that Catholici&s;in and &s;lavery
are not nece&s;&s;arily connected, have been
un&s;ucce&s;sful. It is not unworthy of ob|&s;ervation,
that the great religious Re|former
of Geneva, who has given his
name to the mo&s;t exten&s;ive portion of the
Prote&s;tant world, &s;hould have rivetted the
chains of religious de&s;poti&s;m, while he
became, by his political in&s;titutions, the
father of civil liberty in Europe. The&s;e
&s;pots in the con&s;titution of Geneva will
perhaps vani&s;h after a few years of inde|pendence,
provided it can maintain the
due balance between its attractive and
<PB N="176" REF="183">
repul&s;ive forces, when placed within the
orbit of &s;o mighty a planet as the French
Republic.</P>
<P>Lau&s;anne to Vevay lies along the bor|der
of the lake, which, &s;een from its
level in the direction towards the valley
from which its waters flow, to that point
where they again become a river, appears
like a wide arm of the &s;ea. On the
right, the du&s;ky rocks of Chablais &s;kirted
the oppo&s;ite &s;hores, while above our path
on the left, the pendant vines, though
now de&s;poiled of their purple clu&s;ters,
&s;pread their faded drapery along the
lo&s;ty hills.</P>
<P>At the di&s;tance of a mile from Vevay,
our ears were &s;truck with &s;ounds which
we had not heard &s;ince our arrival in
Switzerland. The&s;e were the Mar&s;eillois
march, proceeding from a band of mu&s;ic,
<PB N="177" REF="184">
which the turn of an angle of the road
brought within our view, and which was
followed by a numerous band of young
men, who, with great good-humour and
gaiety, hailed us by the long unheard &s;alu|tations
of &startq;Bon jour, citoyens; Bon jour,
citoyennes.&endq; We an&s;wered the&s;e repub|lican
compliments in the &s;ame &s;tyle in
which they were made, and concluded
that this was a groupe of the new French
citizens of Mont Blanc, who had cro&s;&s;ed
the lake for the purpo&s;e of a fe&s;tival. The
day, alas! proved no fe&s;tival to this gay
troop, as I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to relate.</P>

<P>VEVAY is e&s;teemed the mo&s;t beauti|ful
town in the Pays de Vaud. The
hills, fertile to their &s;ummits in corn
and wine, which had hitherto &s;kirted
the lake, forming a rich and beautiful
amphitheatre, here ri&s;e into mountains,
which gradually &s;welled at no great
di&s;tance into part of that immen&s;e
chain of Alps that form the &s;outhern
barrier of Switzerland.</P>
<P>Vevay is the principal port for the
commerce of the Vallais, and formerly
of Savoy, with the latter of which, now
<PB N="179" REF="186">
forming part of the French Republic,
there was no more friendly communi|cation
than could be well avoided. The
country around Vevay, where Rou&s;leau
has placed the &s;cene of his charming
romance, is become cla&s;sic ground.
On our left, as we journeyed towards
the Vallais, we pa&s;&s;ed the village of
Clarens, embo&s;omed in trees at the
foot of a mountain; farther on is the
ca&s;tle of Chillon, &s;eated in the lake;
over which, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, hang
the dark rocks of Meillerie. It would
be hopele&s;s to attempt a new &s;ketch of
the&s;e enchanting regions after the glow|ing
de&s;cription of Rou&s;&s;eau, which has
already been &s;o often detailed by the
hundred &s;entimental pilgrims, who, with
Heloi&s;e in hand, run over the rocks and
mountains to catch the lover's in&s;pira|tion.
All in nature is &s;till romantic,
wild, and graceful, as Rou&s;&s;eau has
<PB N="180" REF="187">
painted it; but the &s;oothing charm a&s;|&s;ociated
with the moral feeling, is in
&s;ome &s;ort di&s;&s;olved. The &s;oft image of
the impa&s;sioned Julia no longer hovers
around the ca&s;tle of Chillen; which is
now converted into a Swi&s;s Ba&s;tile, and
guarded by a &s;tern &s;oldiery. The tear
of &s;en&s;ibility which has &s;o often been
&s;hed over this &s;pot for the woes of
fiction, may now fall for &s;orrows that
have the dull reality of exi&s;tence. It
is not the imaginary maternal &s;hrick
that pierces the ear, it is the groan of
the patriot ri&s;ing from the floor of his
damp dungeon that rends the heart.</P>
<P>We rambled through this romantic
&s;cenery a con&s;iderable part of the day,
which, it being now the &s;ea&s;on when
the &startq;teeth of the Jaman begin to
whiten,&endq; had drawn quite to its clo&s;e
<PB N="181" REF="188">
before we reached the village of Bex,
celebrated for its exten&s;ive &s;alt-works.</P>
<P>We had now entered the lower Val|lais,
that immen&s;e gulph which &s;epa|rates
the double range of Alps and
Glaciers that divide Switzerland from
Italy; and which, branching off from
the ma&s;s that forms St. Gothard, &s;lightly
diverge from each other for nearly an
hundred miles to the lake of Geneva,
formed by the Rhone that ri&s;es at the
farther extremity of the Vallais.</P>
<P>When we reached St. Maurice, we
had attained the furthe&s;t limits of Swi&s;s
territory. Here begins the government
of the democracy of the Vallais. The
clo&s;ing mountains are connected by a
wooden gate which locks up the Re|public,
and forbids all entrance to tho&s;e
who &s;hrink from examination. A bridge
<PB N="182" REF="189">
of one arch thrown over the Rhone at
this pa&s;s is e&s;teemed a fine monument
of Roman architecture. On the rocks
ri&s;ing from the water is built the ca&s;tle
of the Bailiff, to whom is committed
the important charge of excluding all
French principles, and all French new&s;|papers,
the Gazette of Berne excepted;
this we &s;aw notified by a placard &s;tuck
on the wall, which &s;tated the various
degrees of corporal puni&s;hment to be in|flicted
on tho&s;e who &s;hould indulge
them&s;elves in di&s;cu&s;sions on the prin|ciples
of Government, or be guilty of the
overt act of receiving or reading the papers.</P>
<P>About two leagues beyond St. Maurice,
we came within the &s;ound of the ca|taract
of Salenche; which, on a&s;cend|ing
the little eminence that concealed
it from our view, we beheld pouring
from an enormous height its divided
<PB N="183" REF="190">
&s;treams which u&s;ed to ru&s;h down the
perpendicular rock in one broad &s;treet,
producing a far &s;ublimer effect; but the
artificer, who&s;e little mill is placed
near the fall, informed us, that &s;ome
months before he had obtained per|mi&s;sion
of the Bailiff, or Abbot of St.
Maurice, to apply part of the torrent
to his u&s;e, which he contrived to do
by rolling rocks into the &s;tream above,
and dividing its current.</P>
<P>Had the Abbot furni&s;hed the poor
cottager with the means of directing
part of the water to his mill after it
had de&s;cended, which, with a &s;mall ex|pence
he could have done, his bene|volence
would have de&s;erved applau&s;e;
but to arre&s;t with profane hand the
waters at their eagle-height, and turn
them from their headlong pathway, was
<PB N="184" REF="191">
a &s;acrilegious attempt on the maje&s;ty
of the cataract, never to be forgiven.</P>
<P>From the town of Martinach we pro|ceeded
to Sion, the capital of the Vallais.
The Bi&s;hop's palace is plea&s;antly &s;eated
on an eminence which commands a
noble view of the &s;urrounding moun|tains,
and finely cultivated plain, through
which the Rhone winds &s;moothly along.</P>
<P>The government of the Haut Vallais
is democratic, being divided into &s;even
departments, each of which &s;ends a
member cho&s;en by the whole body of
the male inhabitants, above the age of
fourteen years, to the congre&s;s, which
is held twice a year, and is compo&s;ed
of the&s;e &s;even members, the Bi&s;hop and
Pre&s;ident of the Republic, who is cho&s;en
by this a&s;&s;embly for two years. As the&s;e
deputies are named annually, and can
<PB N="185" REF="192">
never &s;werve from the in&s;tructions they
receive from their con&s;tituents, there
&s;eems nothing in the in&s;titution that is
unfavourable to liberty; but, unfortu|nately,
the &s;ame vices that prevail in
the democracies of Switzerland, and the
Gri&s;ons, have al&s;o their influence in
the Vallais. This liberty, &s;uch as it is,
belongs to the Haut Vallais alone. A
rivulet that flows from the mountains
at &s;ome little di&s;tance below Sion, marks
the difference between the &s;overeign
and the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>At the clo&s;e of the fifteenth century
the inhabitants of both the upper and
lower Vallais had joined their forces
to overthrow the power of the Bi&s;hop;
but quarrelling afterwards for the di|vi&s;ion
of the &s;poil, a bloody combat
en&s;ued, and ended in the di&s;comfiture
of the lower Vallais, which has remained
<PB N="186" REF="193">
&s;ubject &s;ince that period, and is go|verned,
like other &s;ubjects of the Swi&s;s
Cantons, by Bailiffs. Of this &s;ubjection
the lower Vallais is &s;ometimes very
&s;en&s;ibly reminded by their &s;overeigns
of the mountains. About four years
&s;ince, the&s;e Va&s;&s;als had &s;o far forgot|ten
their allegiance, as to break out
into open revolt; the Bailiff of Mon|they,
having thought fit to throw one of
the&s;e &s;ubjects into pri&s;on becau&s;e he
refu&s;ed to pay an extraordinary fine,
the people of the lower Vallais con|ceived
an opinion that they had a
right to rid them&s;elves of both Bailiff
and Sovereigns. This act of trea&s;on and
rebellion was, however, puni&s;hed in a
very exemplary manner. The demo|crats
of the higher Vallais no &s;ooner
heard of this atrocious attempt of their
&s;ubjects, than without deigning to u&s;e
the military appareil of cannon, or
<PB N="187" REF="194">
waiting to organize an army, they
poured down from their mountains with
pitchforks, &s;pades, thre&s;hing flails, and
ropes, as the Syracu&s;ans armed with
whips marched again&s;t their &s;laves, and
fell upon the in&s;urgents without mode|ration
or mercy.</P>
<P>The fate of war hung doubtful, when
the &s;ympathetic government of Berne,
di&s;playing a ju&s;t horror at this di&s;loyal
conduct, the poor Vallai&s;ans being placed
between two fires, were compelled to
yield unconditional &s;ubmi&s;sion; and the
Chiefs of the&s;e new a&s;&s;ertors of the rights
of man, expiated their crimes again&s;t
their irritated &s;overeigns at the gallows.</P>
<P>We went no further than Sion, which
is only the entrance of the higher
Vallais, and had therefore no opportu|nity
of contemplating the Golden Age,
<PB N="188" REF="195">
which is &s;aid to be in full bloom above.
I have often admired the charming
picture which Rou&s;&s;eau traces of the
inhabitants of tho&s;e regions; but I con|fe&s;s
that the knowledge of the hanging
&s;cene in the lower Vallais has very &s;en|&s;ibly
dimini&s;hed my re&s;pect for the So|vereigns
of the mountain. The iron
hand of oppre&s;sion is not the only evil
that is felt by this &s;ubject-race; from
whatever cau&s;es, phy&s;ical or moral, it
proceeds, a number of the inhabitants
are afflicted by the mo&s;t humiliating
of all the vi&s;itations of heaven, Idioti&s;m.
This &s;tate, unfelt by the individual, is
not even by his family con&s;idered as a
misfortune. The poor object, who&s;e
&s;tupid &s;tare, lolling tongue, di&s;torted
laugh, and inarticulated &s;ounds, affect
the traveller with horror, is, from &s;ome
kind &s;uper&s;tition, cheri&s;hed in this re|gion
as the favourite of heaven, and
<PB N="189" REF="196">
&s;ecure of receiving all the tender cares
of humanity. Another &s;pectacle of di&s;|gu&s;t
which this country pre&s;ents, is the
excre&s;cence on the neck, known by
the name of Goitres, and which is often
a&s;&s;ociated with Idioti&s;m. The lower
Vallais, notwith&s;tanding the habitual in|dolence
of the inhabitants, &s;eems well
cultivated wherever it is capable of cul|tivation.
This plain is &s;ometimes buried
beneath the overflowing waters of the
Rhone, which, when &s;wollen by the
torrents, di&s;dain other &s;hores than the
chain of mountains which bounds the
country. But whatever may be the
national or moral defects of this re|gion,
the inhabitants &s;eem to feel a &s;trong
per&s;ua&s;ion that they enjoy the peculiar
favour of the Supreme Being, and have
expre&s;&s;ed this &s;entiment by in&s;cribing
from the p&s;alms, on the portal of the
town-hou&s;e, in broad letters, &startq;The Lord
<PB N="190" REF="197">
loveth the gates of <HI>Sion</HI> more than all
the tabernacles of Jacob.&endq;</P>
<P>We had intended, on our return to
Martinach, to vi&s;it the Fathers on the
&s;ummit of the great St. Bernard, but
were prevented by hearing that a con|&s;iderable
quantity of &s;now had ju&s;t fallen;
which, according to our ho&s;t's informa|tion,
would require two or three days
previous treading by other pa&s;&s;engers,
before we ought our&s;elves to a&s;cend.
This hone&s;t Vallai&s;an amu&s;ed us with
a long hi&s;tory of the Lords and Dukes
whom he had led acro&s;s tho&s;e lo&s;ty
regions; and, in order to in&s;pire us at
once with re&s;pect and confidence, told
us he had even conducted a prince of
the blood-royal of England, and the
King of Pru&s;sia.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="198">
Nothing alarmed us more during the
latter part of our travels in Switzerland
than intelligence of the intimacy of
our inn-keeper with the great. We
had already been tolerably taxed at
Bellinzone in con&s;equence of the mag|nificent
ideas of expence which our
landlord had acquired by conducting
the charming Duche&s;s of Devon&s;hire
over St. Gothard. We were perfectly
aware that the imperial honours and
trophies which bloomed around our ho&s;t
at Martinach, portended no good to
our plebeian pur&s;es, and therefore, with|out
waiting till the &s;nows were har|dened,
we ordered our hor&s;es and re|turned
to Vevay.</P>

&s;pacious, and well built; many of the
public edifices are dedicated to religion,
this Canton being eminently devout
and catholic. The Cathedral is re|markable
for its &s;olidity and elegance;
but the town, however agreeable to the

<P>The government of Fribourg, like tho&s;e
of Lucerne and Soleure, is a confirmed
ari&s;tocracy. The power is centered in
the hands of a council of two hun|dred,
who, with various divi&s;ions, and
&s;ubdivi&s;ions of authority, hold the ab|&s;olute
<PB N="194" REF="201">
&s;overeignty. Some modifications
were made in their original con&s;titution
fifteen or &s;ixteen years &s;ince, when the
inhabitants of the Canton, irritated at
the various depredations committed on
their per&s;ons and properties by that
portion of the &s;overeign called Bailiffs,
a&s;&s;embled together and be&s;ieged Fribourg
it&s;elf.</P>
<P>It is &s;omewhat remarkable, that in a
long and varied excur&s;ion through Swit|zerland,
a country which has been &s;aid
to produce Arcadian wealth and happi|ne&s;s
to the lower cla&s;&s;es, we &s;hould
&s;carcely have pa&s;&s;ed over a territory
which had not been the &s;cene of a
revolt.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the Canton of Fri|bourg,
like tho&s;e of the lower Vallais,
had not to &s;truggle with their own ty|rants
<PB N="195" REF="202">
alone; the &s;overeign council cooped
within its walls, might have been com|pelled
to capitulate to its &s;ubjects, had
not the &s;ympathetic &s;overeign council
of Berne, &s;truck again with horror at
this unparalleled and &s;acrilegious outrage
committed again&s;t their ally, a&s;&s;embled
in&s;tantly its forces and marched to their
relief. The in&s;urgents were of cour&s;e re|duced
to rea&s;on. The chiefs &s;aved
them&s;elves from the &s;hame of a public
execution by throwing them&s;elves with
de&s;peration upon the bayonets of the &s;a|tellites
&s;ent to apprehend them; and va|rious
puni&s;hments were inflicted on the
re&s;t. The French mini&s;try kindly lend|ing
its a&s;i&s;tance towards the pre&s;erva|tion
of regular governments in Europe,
although it had at that period di&s;co|vered
a different policy with re&s;pect to
America, conde&s;cended to become the
public executioner of the vengeance of
<PB N="196" REF="203">
the Fribourg-magi&s;tracy, and &s;ent their
victims to the gallies, whence they were
relea&s;ed by order of the fir&s;t National
A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>The in&s;urgents being thus &s;everely
puni&s;hed, it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e that
the wrongs of which they complained
were totally di&s;regarded. Some &s;mall
changes were made in their con&s;titution
that gave a greater exten&s;ion of power
to tho&s;e families in the &s;overeign coun|cil
who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed little or none previous
to this in&s;urrection. To them the re|bellion
proved of advantage; but the
people were left in the &s;ame &s;ubject
&s;tate, and were permitted, according to
a received opinion among the privileged
orders of the pre&s;ent day, to know no|thing
of the laws but to obey them.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Arrival at Berne.&mdash;Berne.&mdash;Government.&mdash;Mode of
Election.&mdash;Authorities.</HEAD>
<P>ON our arrival at the gates of Berne,
we were que&s;tioned with &s;tern &s;everity
re&s;pecting our country, our names, our
profe&s;sions, whence we came, whither
we were going, and above all, what were
the motives of our vi&s;it. Nothing can be
more calculated to de&s;troy all impre&s;sions
of Swi&s;s freedom than this ab&s;urd kind of
police, which has &s;o completely the air
of de&s;poti&s;m, and which is particularly
di&s;agreeable to an Engli&s;h traveller, who
recollects that in his own country, &s;trang|ers
from every quarter of the globe are
received without inquiry or di&s;tru&s;t; and
are not &s;ubject to the impertinent inter|rogations
of officers civil or military. The
town of Berne, although the capital only
<PB N="198" REF="205">
of a Canton, may, from its elegance, rank
with the capitals of exten&s;ive States; but
the public buildings, beautiful walks,
and &s;ublime pro&s;pects of this city, have
often been de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>The French Revolution has had a con|&s;iderable
influence on the political con|cerns
of Berne. The &s;overeignty of this
Canton, like that of the other ari&s;tocrati|cal
Cantons of Switzerland, is centered in
a great council, a &s;enate, which is a
divi&s;ion of the former, and of magi&s;trates
cho&s;en out of this latter body. The great
council, called the two hundred, is in
ab&s;olute po&s;&s;e&s;sion of the &s;ole and un|divided
authority of the &s;tate, the imme|diate
exerci&s;e of which is committed to
the &s;enate, compo&s;ed of twenty-&s;even
members. The vacancies in the &s;enate
are filled up by the great council, as tho&s;e
which take place among the members of
<PB N="199" REF="206">
this body are filled up by individuals,
cho&s;en principally among the burghers of
Berne. The power of the government of
this Canton is the lea&s;t limited of any in
Switzerland. In the great and important
intere&s;ts of the &s;tate, both foreign and
dome&s;tic, &s;uch as levying taxes, or mak|ing
war and peace, the citizens of Lu|cerne,
Fribourg, and Soleure, a&s;&s;emble to
deliberate and decide; but at Berne
nothing is le&s;s &s;overeign than the people,
to whom, in no ca&s;e, is any appeal made,
either for approbation or authority. All
places of honour, authority, or profit,
belong exclu&s;ively to &s;eventy-&s;ix families
of Berne, of whom the great council is
compo&s;ed; but as &s;ome of the families
who po&s;&s;e&s;s tho&s;e va&s;t and important pri|vileges,
furni&s;h twelve, fourteen, and
even twenty members, it is found that
&s;eventeen families &s;hare at pre&s;ent the
majority of votes.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="207">
In the &s;pace of ten years, a vacancy in
the council of &s;eventy or eighty members
takes place by death. At this period, an
electoral a&s;&s;embly, con&s;i&s;ting of the great
officers of &s;tate, the &s;enate, and &s;ixteen
members of the great council whom it
names, proceed to the important nomina|tion.
The choice of the &s;tate-officers,
and the &s;enate, may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have
been long fixed on the members of their
own families, but who &s;hall be the happy
mortal on whom the choice of the yet
unelected, and unknown <HI>&s;ixteeners</HI> &s;hall
fall? If the &s;ixteener has a &s;on of full age,
the bu&s;ine&s;s is of cour&s;e decided; but if
he be only ble&s;&s;ed with a daughter, hi&s;|torians
relax from their dignity to de&s;cribe
with what ardour of pa&s;sion twenty a&s;|piring
youths, who, till that eventful
moment, had gazed upon the nymph
without emotion, become &s;uddenly en|amoured
of her charms. It mu&s;t indeed
<PB N="201" REF="208">
be allowed, that marriages founded on
that ob&s;olete &s;cheme of happine&s;s ari&s;ing
from congenial character, and &s;ympathy
of &s;oul, and di&s;daining all views of in|tere&s;t
or ambition, are quite as remote
from the &s;peculations of the young men
of other great cities, as from tho&s;e of
Berne. The only peculiarity in this in|&s;tance,
is, that the court&s;hip begins and
ends in the &s;pace of four days, that being
the interval between the election of the
<HI>&s;ixteener</HI> by the council, and his nomina|tion
of his daughter's favoured lover;
who immediately becomes a &s;ub&s;tantial
portion of the &s;overeign, incumbered only
with the &s;upplement of a wife.</P>
<P>Mr. Cox mentions, that in his fir&s;t vi&s;it
he found the people of Berne by no
means &s;o well informed as tho&s;e of the
other Cantons of Switzerland; but that
the young Burghers, in order to acquire
<PB N="202" REF="209">
a knowledge of the art of governing, had
formed a &s;ociety called the <HI>External
State,</HI> compo&s;ed of a council, &s;enate, and
officers of every rank; and that all that
was done by their fathers, who held the
real power, was imitated by their a&s;piring
&s;ons. The offices al&s;o of profit were not
forgotten, and Bailiffs were named to
pre&s;ide over the ruins of old ca&s;tles that
are &s;cattered through the Canton, in
order to prepare their governors for the
enjoyment of tho&s;e &s;plendid Bailliwicks
which are in good repair in their neigh|bourhood.</P>
<P>In his &s;econd journey, made ten years
afterwards, Mr. Cox congratulates him|&s;elf,
and his readers, that rouzed from
their lethargy, the magi&s;trates had &s;ent
to London to purcha&s;e in&s;truments of ex|perimental
philo&s;ophy, and had bought a
building for the reception of books. The&s;e
<PB N="203" REF="210">
wi&s;e regulations would no doubt, in due
time, have produced their proper effects.
Science would by degrees have infu&s;ed its
benignant rays, and the elegance of
literary acquirements would at length
have bani&s;hed the barbarous dialect of
their theological &s;chool, hitherto the
mo&s;t cultivated branch of their public
education.</P>
<P>But the ample page of a new volume
having now unrolled to their eyes its
rich &s;tores of political knowledge<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><L>&startq;But knowledge to their eyes her ample page,</L>

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the chief magi&s;tracy
in every department of the &s;tate is ex|clu&s;ively
cho&s;en among the members of
the &s;enate, we are informed by Mr. Cox,
that this body is far from enjoying the
ab&s;olute authority with which other
ari&s;trocratical &s;enates of Switzerland are
inve&s;ted; and that the great council is in
a continual &s;tate of watchfulne&s;s over its
&s;teps; that although ari&s;tocratical con&s;ti|tutions
are often above all others the mo&s;t
oppre&s;sive to the people, who in&s;tead of
one de&s;pot, are governed by an hundred
tyrants, Berne, and all the ari&s;tocracies
of Switzerland, are an exception to this
rule; that nothing is more wi&s;e and more
moderate than the &s;pirit of their govern|ments,
and nothing more remote from
arbitrary power, than the &s;crupulous at|tention
<PB N="205" REF="212">
with which they re&s;pect the pri|vileges
of their &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>To this te&s;timony may be added that of
Mr. Burke, who a&s;&s;erts, that the Repub|lic
of Berne is one of the happie&s;t, mo&s;t
pro&s;perous, and be&s;t governed countries
on earth.</P>
<P>Such were the the general ideas enter|tained
of the &s;tate of Liberty in Switzer|land,
before the event of the French
Revolution. Since that period, an ho&s;t
of facts are cited to prove opinions of a
very different complexion. It is now
a&s;&s;erted, that the freedom of Swi&s;s go|vernments
has been the &s;ubject of eulo|gium
only becau&s;e compared with the
other Republics of Europe; the name be|&s;towed
on the &s;mall number of oligarchies,
the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of which have lately
di&s;appeared; the inhabitants of Switzer|land
<PB N="206" REF="213">
enjoyed relative advantages; as the
glow-worm becomes a luminary when all
around is darkne&s;s. This important que&s;|tion
is at pre&s;ent not only the theme of
much animadver&s;ion in France, but of
keen enquiry among&s;t the di&s;contented
&s;ubjects of Berne in the Pays de Vaud.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Reclamations of the Pays de Vaud&mdash;U&s;urpation and ar|bitrary
Conduct of the Canton of Berne.&mdash;Di&s;content
of the Nobles.</HEAD>
<P>THE inhabitants of the exten&s;ive and
delightful country of the Pays de Vaud,
have long &s;ince di&s;covered in the re|&s;earches
of their hi&s;tory, that formerly
they enjoyed the benefits of a free con|&s;titution,
which they a&s;&s;ert was main|tained
in all its purity, and re&s;pected by
their princes, till the epoch of the junc|tion
of their territory to the Canton of
Berne, in the year 1536. They in&s;i&s;t,
that the rights inherent in the a&s;&s;emblies
of the States were inconte&s;tible proofs of
the liberty of the people; that the Princes
of the Hou&s;e of Savoy were little more
than their nominal chiefs; and that when
their authority was transferred to the Can|tons
of Berne, and Fribourg, it was ex|pre&s;sly
<PB N="208" REF="215">
&s;tipulated that this country &s;hould
retain all the privileges which it then
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Hence ari&s;es the conclu&s;ion,
that the&s;e Cantons ought not to pretend
to the exerci&s;e of any other prerogatives,
than tho&s;e which belonged to their
princes, and that the government ought
to be held by no other tenor, than it was
held at the epoch of the treaty.</P>
<P>As the Government of Berne has been
far from admitting the ju&s;tice of the&s;e
claims, it may be conjectured, that vari|ous
are the acts of illegal authority of
which the&s;e &s;ubjects have had to com|plain.
The fir&s;t blow given to the con|&s;titution
of their country, &s;ay they, was
the divi&s;ion of the Pays de Vaud between
the two Cantons; which, by de&s;troying
the unity of their government, prevented
the convocation of the &s;tates. In order
to root out ancient prejudices and attach|ments,
<PB N="209" REF="216">
after this fir&s;t great divi&s;ion had
taken place, various &s;ubdivi&s;ions were
made of the government of di&s;tricts; and
the &s;ingle Bailiff, or repre&s;entative of the
Duke of Savoy, with very limited power,
was quartered out into twenty-nine &s;ove|reign
Bailiffs from the Cantons of Berne,
and Fribourg.</P>
<P>The people of the Pays de Vaud a&s;&s;ert,
that, in con&s;equence of this di&s;organiza|tion
of their con&s;titution, their governors
have in&s;tituted the mo&s;t illegal and arbi|trary
cu&s;toms; that they have made mili|tary
contracts with the various princes
of Europe for troops which are annu|ally
recruited from the Pays de Vaud;
the command of which is monopolized
by the patrician families of Berne; that
the militia of the country has not only
been rai&s;ed and organized, without its
permi&s;sion, but in &s;everal in&s;tances has
<PB N="210" REF="217">
been made the in&s;trument of the venge|ance
and tyranny of their governors, or
the Cantons their allies; and that the
lucrative civil employments which were
originally but few, in&s;tead of being di&s;|tributed
as formerly, among the citizens
of the country, are now confined to the
&s;eventy-&s;ix reigning families of Berne,
and increa&s;ed at plea&s;ure according to
their wants or their avarice.</P>
<P>Heretofore, they continue, the States
of the Pays de Vaud made treaties of al|liance
offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive with the
neighbouring powers. Payerne, Avenche,
the capital of antient Helvetia, and the
Republic of Lau&s;anne, have &s;ucce&s;sively
concluded treaties of alliance with Berne,
and but ten years previous to their junc|tion,
were &s;tyled, according to the letter
of tho&s;e treaties, their good friends, and
dear neighbours. This &s;entiment of
<PB N="211" REF="218">
friend&s;hip, and good neighbourhood, has
indeed, long &s;ince, given place to a
more intimate connection of another kind,
though with fewer feelings of reciprocal
affection.</P>
<P>The&s;e patriots &s;eem to have no &s;uch
clear perception of the benefits which
have re&s;ulted to their country from this
connection, as the hi&s;torian of the refor|mation<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Abraham Ru&s;chat, abreg&eacute; de l'hi&s;toire eccle&s;ia&s;|tique de Pays de Vaud, Vol. v. p. 667.</NOTE>, who, with &s;ome naivet&eacute;, ob|&s;erves
to the good people of Lau&s;anne,
&startq;that although what were called regal
rights, &s;uch as the right of pardon, of coin|ing,
of rai&s;ing troops, and other acts of
&s;overeignty and independence, were tran&s;|ferred
to Berne; yet as the trea&s;ure of
the cathedral, and the epi&s;copal archives
were al&s;o tran&s;ported thither, after due
confi&s;cation of the e&s;tates of the clergy,
<PB N="212" REF="219">
a great door was opened to the inhabi|tants
of Lau&s;anne to come to the truth;

they received in return for tho&s;e
temporal trea&s;ures, by the e&s;tabli&s;hment
of the Reformation, advantages infinitely
precious, as they refer to the life to
come.&endq;</P>

Vaud, date the evils of which they com|plain
from this period, which they &s;arca&s;|tically
call the &startq;ble&s;&s;ed reformation;&endq;
which, by dividing the opinions of the
people, &s;unk them more ea&s;ily into &s;ub|jection.
They al&s;o tell us, that the eccle|&s;ia&s;tical
benefices of their country were
&s;ecularized to make ari&s;tocratical bene|fices;
that<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>The decrees of the National A&s;&s;embly declaring the e&s;tates of the church the property of the nation, which rai&s;ed again&s;t them from the prote&s;tant govern|ments in Europe, for the catholics were better inform|ed, the cry of &s;acrilege and impiety was no where more &s;everely cenfured than at Berne. Dr. Cart amu&s;es him&s;elf with imagining the tenor of the con|ver&s;ations re&s;pecting the&s;e atrocious acts of inju&s;tice, that &s;ometimes pa&s;&s;ed between the French emigrant Bi&s;hops and the Bailiff of Lau&s;anne, the pre&s;ent po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or of the epi&s;copal palace, in right of &s;uch &s;acrilegi|ous confi&s;cations at the Reformation; with this dif|ference, that the e&s;tates of the Church in France were appropriated to pay the debts of the Nation, while here they were con&s;ecrated to form revenues for pri|vate families, who were &s;trangers to the country.</P>
<P>Among the victims of the Reformation in the Pays de Vaud, was the rich Prior of Romainmoitiers. He had &s;ome other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Franche Comt&eacute;, and flhed thither, when a Burgher of Berne, as Bailiff, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his e&s;tates. Two hundred and &s;ixty years after, the French Revolution leads his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to &s;eek refuge in Berne. Finding the government petri|fied with horror at the atrocious acts of the Revolu|tion, and particularly tho&s;e which regarded the Church, the Abb&eacute; Petit Jean, ob&s;erved, that they could give no proof more convincing of their dete&s;ta|tion, than by ordering the pre&s;ent Bailiff who hap|pened to be a General, to vacate a &s;eat which belonged in right to a monk. The Abb&eacute; gained permi&s;&s;ion to examine the archives of his hou&s;e, which were tran|&s;ported to Berne; and finding charters which proved his right to the priory, whil&s;t he was looking for other documents, he had the &s;implicity to write a pamphlet to prove that the Government had no right to deprive the Church of the e&s;tates of his priory, or to appropriate them to its own &s;ervice. The Chan|cellor of Berne atte&s;ted the conformity of the copies to the original; but as to re&s;titution, the Government &s;till continued exceedingly indignant at the atrocious decree of the National A&s;&s;embly, which had forced the Abb&eacute; to leave his priory in Franche Comt&eacute;.</P></NOTE> the &s;acred va&s;es, the &s;aints
<PB N="213" REF="220">
of &s;ilver and gold, the precious decora|tions
of the epi&s;copal church, and of
<PB N="214" REF="221">
their mona&s;teries, were tran&s;ported to
Berne; and that tho&s;e offerings which
the piety of their ance&s;tors had con&s;e|crated
to God, but which the pious hi&s;|torian
of the reformation calls &s;poils from
Satan, were converted into long chains of
gold, to decorate the per&s;ons, as the
<PB N="215" REF="222">
other precious effects of the church had
been taken for the u&s;e, and now remain
heir-looms of patrician families. They
complain how little they have gained by
exchanging a Bailiff, for a Bi&s;hop; a
Burgher, for a Prince; the mini&s;ters of
their religion, and their convents of pious
ve&s;tals, con&s;ecrating their holy lives to the
&s;ervice of heaven, for the di&s;sipation and
luxurious domination of arrogant u&s;urpers.</P>
<P>It is no more true, however, as the
pre&s;ent writers in favour of the liberty
of the Pays de Vaud, pretend, that the
true cau&s;e of the zeal of the reformers of
Berne is to be found in the rich &s;poils of
the church, which they meditated &s;eiz|ing
and tran&s;porting to their city, than
it is true that the &s;ublime effort which
effected the French Revolution, had, as
&s;ome a&s;&s;ert, its origin in the delirious
ambition of demagogues. Both the Re|formation
<PB N="216" REF="223">
and the Revolution were
founded on principles more generous
than the gratification of &s;ordid or &s;elfi&s;h
pa&s;sions, although the&s;e noble cau&s;es have
been &s;ometimes &s;ullied by the conduct of
their re&s;pective adherents.</P>
<P>It is worthy of remark, that the
di&s;ciples of the Romi&s;h church di&s;covered
no le&s;s abhorrence of the innovations at
that period, than the de&s;cendants of the
reformers of Berne feel for the reformers
of the pre&s;ent day. Luther, and the
Reformation, were then objects of no le&s;s
horror, than are now the French Propa|gande,
and the Rights of Man. Only ten
years before the junction of the Pays de
Vaud to Berne, the &s;tates of the former
country, a&s;&s;embled at Moudon, within
a few leagues of Berne, decreed, that if
any one &s;hould buy any book, or propa|gate
any doctrine of that cur&s;ed and
<PB N="217" REF="224">
di&s;loyal heretic, Martin Luther, &startq;he
&s;hould, in ca&s;e of hardne&s;s and ob&s;tinacy,
be burnt alive, with the books, if &s;uch
were in his po&s;&s;e&s;sion.&endq;.</P>
<P>The government of Berne is accu&s;ed
not only of having deprived the Vaudois of
their liberties, but of having drained them
of their money, by extorting arbitrary
contributions under the mo&s;t frivolous
pretences; it appears from the&s;e calcu|lating

that the Burghers of Berne, at the epoch
of the French Revolution, promi&s;ed that
the&s;e remon&s;trances &s;hould be taken into

<P>In an&s;wer to the defenders of the right
of the ab&s;olute government of Berne over
<PB N="219" REF="226">
the Pays de Vaud, from its being a con|quered
country, the&s;e Vaudois maintain
that &s;uch conque&s;t was never effected.
They a&s;&s;ert that when the Duke of Savoy,
in violation of the treaty of 1530, called
the Treaty of St. Julian, which was
formed to guarantee Geneva from future
inva&s;ion, had again taken arms, the
government of Berne found the Pays de
Vaud faithful to its alliance; not only
renewing the treaty at the moment when
war was declared by this government
again&s;t the Duke of Savoy, their nominal
Sovereign, but zealous in &s;upporting the
cau&s;e for which the conte&s;t took place.
They contend, that in&s;tead of oppo&s;ing
the projects of the government of Berne,
they had e&s;pou&s;ed its intere&s;t with
warmth; without &s;u&s;pecting that their
confederation again&s;t a faithle&s;s Prince
would have been con&s;trued by their ally
<PB N="220" REF="227">
into a conque&s;t over them&s;elves; that
even if the final expul&s;ion of the Duke
could be deemed a conque&s;t of his rigi$$s,
as Protector, the privileges of the &s;tates,
which were at all times independent of
his power, could not by this event be
annulled.</P>
<P>There are other readings in hi&s;tory re|&s;pecting
this event. It is acknowledged
that the vexations exerci&s;ed again&s;t the
Genevans by the Duke of Savoy, had
afforded a ju&s;t pretence for the inter|po&s;ition
of the Canton of Berne; but that
at the time of this pretended conque&s;t,
the Duke was too bu&s;ily employed in
re&s;i&s;ting the inva&s;ion of his &s;tates by
Francis the Fir&s;t, to think of acting the
oppre&s;&s;or with re&s;pect to Geneva. The
occa&s;ion was neverthele&s;s too favourable
to be omitted by Berne; the Pays de
<PB N="221" REF="228">
Vaud became ab&s;olutely dependent on
the will of its new Protector; and Ge|neva
would have &s;hared the &s;ame fate,
had it not redeemed its independence at
the expence of its pur&s;e.</P>
<P>It is moreover contended, that, as the
con&s;titution of the Pays de Vaud was
never renounced by the inhabitants of
the &s;tate, or annulled by any decree of
the Cantons, admitting &s;uch decrees to
have had any authority, the pre&s;ent &s;ub|jects
of the government of Berne are
authori&s;ed to in&s;i&s;t on the re-e&s;tabli&s;h|ment
of the antient con&s;titution, and de|mand
the convocation of the &s;tates, as
their only lawful repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>This di&s;affection of the Pays de Vaud,
it appears from the account given by Mr.
Cox, exi&s;ted twenty years &s;ince. &startq;The
<PB N="222" REF="229">

of the Pays de Vaud, and of cour&s;e of
the other inhabitants, from any &s;hare in

&s;o great a di&s;content with the mild and
equitable government under which they
lived, that the greater part of the upper
cla&s;&s;es were very willing to change their

It is not ea&s;y to judge of the
mildne&s;s and equity of a government,
where the majority would wi&s;h to get rid
of their republican &s;ervitude, in order to
enjoy monarchical liberty. It appears
that the true rendering of the pa&s;&s;age,
as well as the true interpretation given to
the di&s;content, &s;hould be, that on ac|count
of the vexations to which they
were compelled to &s;ubmit, in&s;tead of
wi&s;hing to turn their republican into a

<PB N="223" REF="230">
happy to find an opportunity of changing
their oligarchy into a repre&s;entative re|public<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In citing this fact of the di&s;content of the in|habitants of the Pays de Vaud, I have made u&s;e of the French tran&s;lation of Mr. Cox's Tour, by M.

Having con&s;ulted the tran&s;|lation of the Second Tour, printed in Paris in 1790, not having the means of con&s;ulting the original, I found that this important fact re&s;pecting the Pays de Vaud is omitted. As Mr. Cox is always cited as an authority, it is probable that the tran&s;lator in this in&s;tance, has been unfaithful; for, as Mr. Cox in|forms us in his preface, that he has not only compared and examined all he had before written, and read every critique on his former work, but had al&s;o employed the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed characters in politics and litera|ture in each principal town to correct his errors, it can &s;carcely be &s;u&s;pected that any grave &s;enator of Berne would have drawn his pen acro&s;s his former account of the &s;editious &s;pirit of the Pays de Vaud, as an error; or that &s;o accurate an hi&s;torian would have left un|noticed the increa&s;e of that &s;pirit of di&s;content, the exi&s;tence of which he had already mentioned, and which has ri&s;en to &s;o great a height as by its effects to menace even the exi&s;tence of government.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>THE admini&s;tration of the govern|ments
of Switzerland have been repre|&s;ented
as more mild and forbearing in
general than other governments of &s;imilar
con&s;truction. Although &s;editions have
frequently been puni&s;hed with great &s;e|verity,
yet the implicit obedience of the
&s;ubject never fails of being rewarded by
the paternal protection of the &s;tate, the
members of which, &s;ince the event of the
French Revolution, have earne&s;tly in|culcated
the doctrine, that happine&s;s is
to be found rather in tranquillity, than in
the turbulent freedom of equal rights.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="232">
This language is &s;aid to have lulled
a great part of the pea&s;antry into the
per&s;ua&s;ion that there is always a &s;uffici|ent
quantity of liberty where there is
peace. The pea&s;antry in every country
is the cla&s;s lea&s;t given to inquiry; they
are affected by no events that do not im|mediately
intere&s;t them&s;elves, and are
therefore the la&s;t to entertain the &s;pirit
of revolutionary enterpri&s;e; unle&s;s, when
driven to de&s;pair, which has &s;ometimes
been the ca&s;e, by the rapacity of their
procon&s;ular governors.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of towns, on the con|trary,
who are better informed, who
have nicer feelings, and a more intimate
knowledge of the events that are pa&s;sing
in the world, are more quick-&s;ighted
in guarding again&s;t abu&s;es and encroach|ments;
and from frequent a&s;&s;ociation are
<PB N="226" REF="233">
more prepared to take advantage of
every favourable circum&s;tance that may
offer to correct them.</P>
<P>In &s;ome parts of Switzerland the pea|&s;antry
enjoy a certain rank in &s;ociety
above the pea&s;antry of other countries;
and though they have no rights as citi|zens,
po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome privileges, &s;uch as
that of bearing arms, on which they &s;et
no little value. In the German part of the
Canton of Berne, this cla&s;s, by which
is under&s;tood not merely labourers, but
the inhabitants of the country in gene|ral,
known in England under the name
of yeomanry, being particularly favoured
by the government, are taught to look
up to their excellencies of Berne with
reverential awe and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>The &s;olicitude of the government
for the welfare of its &s;ubjects is, how|ever,
<PB N="227" REF="234">
extended to few other cla&s;&s;es.
The manufacturer, le&s;s docile than the
pea&s;ant, is far from holding an equal
&s;hare in its affection. There is a &s;pirit
in that cla&s;s in all countries more fa|vourable
to inquiry, and con&s;equently
more ho&s;tile to unconditional &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion;
while, therefore, the peaceful la|bourer
of the glebe enjoys a kind of
privileged protection, every prudent me|thod
has been adopted to dry up the
turbulent &s;ource of national wealth
which &s;prings from manufactures or
commerce.</P>
<P>Although the pea&s;antry form a very
re&s;pectable body of auxiliaries, the go|vernment,
&s;ince the event of the French
revolution, have not been inattentive
in framing other alliances, in order to
&s;trengthen their authority among their
&s;ubjects.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="235">
The nobles of the Pays de Vaud, who,
previous to the year 1782, had been
flattered by the pro&s;pect of an acce&s;|&s;ion
at &s;ome future period to a parti|cipation
of the &s;overeign power, and
who &s;ince that epocha had lo&s;t every
hope of rai&s;ing them&s;elves above the me|chanic
and the pea&s;ant, were, on the
event of the French Revolution, called
to &s;hare in the honours of the State,
by a decree that whenever five of the
partician families became extinct, the
void &s;hould be filled up by three fami|lies
taken from the German, and two
from the French part of the Canton.
This admi&s;sion to the dignity of the
burgher is followed by no &s;olid patri|cian
benefit, &s;ince none of the newly
elected members can obtain any profit|able
employment for the &s;pace of fifty
years; but it was yet believed, that
the hope of this &s;plendid elevation, al|though
<PB N="229" REF="236">
it mu&s;t be confined to a few,
would have &s;ufficient influence to con|ciliate
the whole. Having attempted
to form this truce with the nobles, the
government, faithful to the long e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
maxim of dividing and ruling,
is &s;aid to have fomented differences
among&s;t its &s;ubjects, by infu&s;ing into
the pea&s;antry of the Pays de Vaud, a
&s;alutary jealou&s;y of their own municipal
authorities, who, it was in&s;inuated, were
likely to a&s;&s;ume a dangerous influence,
from which nothing could re&s;cue the
former cla&s;s but their &s;tedfa&s;t adherence
to the &s;upreme government.</P>
<P>Thus with con&s;ummate &s;kill have
the&s;e &s;agacious burghers &s;teered their po|litical
bark amid&s;t the &s;torm of revolu|tionary
principles, which breaking loo&s;e
from France, has inundated all Europe;
yet, notwith&s;tanding all the arts of
<PB N="230" REF="237">
courte&s;ies, and divi&s;ions, tho&s;e principles
of independence which are implanted
in the human heart, and know no geo|graphical
boundaries, have overleapt the
dyke which &s;eparates Switzerland from
France; and the di&s;contents of the Pays
de Vaud have kept pace with the in|crea&s;ing
&s;pirit of general liberty.</P>
<P>When the French, who had long
been the ridicule of Europe for their
boa&s;ted attachment to the per&s;on and
authority of their de&s;potic monarchs,
had &s;haken off this prejudice, and be|come
clamorous for rights which they
had &s;o lately learnt to value, the re|formers
of the Pays de Vaud, who&s;e
di&s;re&s;pect for their governors had been
re&s;trained only by the fear of their power,
thought that the au&s;picious moment
was arrived when they might venture
to &s;ugge&s;t the expediency of a review
<PB N="231" REF="238">
of their con&s;titutional privileges. The
commune of Morges, in 1790, addre&s;&s;ed
a memorial to this effect, on occa&s;ion
of &s;ome municipal abu&s;es, to the patri|cians
of Berne, and in ju&s;tification of
their claims cited the charters of
Lewis of Savoy, Baron of Vaud, of I&s;a|bella
of Chalons, of Amadeus the fifth,
the &s;ixth, the &s;eventh, and onwards, of
Philiberts and Charleses, to prove the
validity of their preten&s;ions.</P>
<P>The frowns of the government, at
the di&s;play of &s;uch mu&s;ty titles, &s;ome|what
chilled this patriotic ardour; but
the flight of Lewis the XVIth to the
frontier having been celebrated by fe&s;ti|vals,
both civil and religious, at Berne
and Fribourg, the Patriots of the Pays
de Vaud fondly believed that it would
be con&s;idered as no infraction of their
allegiance, if they commemorated with
<PB N="232" REF="239">
civic rejoicings the anniver&s;ary of the
memorable 14th of July. This meeting
was publicly adverti&s;ed; and, although
the agents of government, it is a&s;&s;erted,
endeavoured to prompt the a&s;&s;embly to
indi&s;cretions by exaggerated allu&s;ions and
propo&s;itions, the day pa&s;&s;ed in tranquillity:
patriotic toa&s;ts were drank: French airs
were &s;ung; and the hat, the &s;ymbol of
Swi&s;s liberty, affixed on all the public
monuments of the State, was paraded
with univer&s;al acclamation.</P>
<P>This commemoration, which took
place at the &s;ame time in many towns
of the Pays de Vaud, gave &s;erious alarm
to the government. There was no po|&s;itive
law again&s;t fe&s;tivals; but the ce|lebration
of the 14th of July was an
event too big with con&s;equences to be
pa&s;&s;ed over without animadver&s;ion; and
it was judged nece&s;&s;ary to cru&s;h the
<PB N="233" REF="240">
progre&s;s of the&s;e &s;editious propen&s;ities.
Accordingly, on the fir&s;t of September
following, a &s;pecial tribunal, compo&s;ed of
four patricians of Berne, under the
name of the high commi&s;sion, was &s;ent
into the Pays de Vaud, attended by a
numerous military train, to bring the of|fenders
to trial.</P>
<P>They had flattered them&s;elves that
the la&s;t wreck of their liberty, the rights
of criminal judicature, would have been
held inviolate, and remembered that
under the protection of the prince of
Savoy, when any conte&s;t aro&s;e between
the inhabitants and their chief, he was
compelled to &s;ubmit to the deci&s;ion of
their tribunals.</P>
<P>The government of Berne had, indeed,
already betrayed &s;ymptoms of a di&s;po|&s;ition
to &s;everity, when on the accu&s;a|tion,
<PB N="234" REF="241">
and by order of the tythe-gatherer,
a venerable pa&s;tor of a church had been
&s;ent to the pri&s;ons of Berne, on the
charge of high trea&s;on, for maintaining
before his con&s;i&s;tory that potatoes were
not wheat, and therefore not titheable;
but, although a reclamation again&s;t
taxes might with an appearance of ju&s;|tice
be con&s;trued into trea&s;on, &s;ince it
was a &s;editious oppo&s;ition to &s;overeign
authority, the celebration of a fe&s;tival
which thou&s;ands of their countrymen
were, as an act of duty and obedience,
celebrating at the &s;ame time<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">14th July, 1791.</NOTE> in France,
would &s;carcely, they had imagined, be
&s;o mi&s;interpreted.</P>
<P>Cannon charged with grape-&s;hot, and
planted at the end of their principal
&s;treets; the hou&s;es of the Patriots con|verted
into barracks for the military,
<PB N="235" REF="242">
and the arbitrary orders i&s;&s;ued for ar|re&s;ts,
&s;oon taught the inhabitants of
Lau&s;anne that their &s;overeign had no
ta&s;te for &s;uch compliments to the French
nation &s;o near their own territory. In
vain the people of the Pays de Vaud
inquired what was the crime of their
newly invaded country? Had they been
in in&s;urrection? Had they taken arms
again&s;t the burghers of Berne? Had they
di&s;obeyed any of their orders? Had
they &s;hown any marks of di&s;re&s;pect to
their bailiffs? Had they &s;ent to their
faithful ally of three hundred years, de|putations
of congratulation like the po|pular
&s;ocieties of the Engli&s;h nation,
heretofore their natural enemies? None
of the&s;e extravagancies had they com|mitted.
Something, indeed, like a &s;pirit
of in&s;ubordination, though not to the ex|tent
of the incredulity of the pa&s;tor of
Mezieres, had di&s;covered it&s;elf in humble
<PB N="236" REF="243">
repre&s;entations again&s;t certain abu&s;es in
taxation; and they had drank to the
&s;ucce&s;s of the French revolution, but
without ever conjecturing that tho&s;e acts
could ju&s;tify an arraignment before &s;uch

M. de la Harpe, receiving no an&s;wer to
his reclamations again&s;t the tribunals,
&s;ought refuge in the French camp, where
he was hailed as a martyr, and named
Chief of a battalion of the volunteers of
the Seine and Oi&s;e, at the clo&s;e of the
year 1791. In the following year, he
commanded the advanced po&s;ts at the
ca&s;tle of Rodemak on the extreme fron|tiers
of France, and, receiving the fir&s;t at|tacks
of the coale&s;ced armies on their
march into the Republic, was expo&s;ed to
imminent danger by the &s;udden and un|expected
&s;urrender of the two frontier
towns of Longwy and Verdun. Without
hopes of making any effectual re&s;i&s;tance,
La Harpe was re&s;olved to give the fir&s;t
example of that devotedne&s;s which the
friends of Liberty owe to her cau&s;e, and
found no difficulty in communicating
this enthu&s;ia&s;m to his &s;oldiers. They all
&s;wore on his &s;word, that they would never
<PB N="244" REF="251">
capitulate; and if, when reduced to the
la&s;t extremity, they could not force their
pa&s;&s;age, that they would bury them&s;elves
with the enemy under the ruins of the
ca&s;tle, the &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;ages of which
they had converted into mines.</P>
<P>This generous re&s;olution was prevented
from being carried into effect by General
Luckner, who ordered the po&s;t to be eva|cuated,
and the artillery and ammunition
to be tran&s;ported to Thionville. The
order was executed by La Harpe, in &s;ight
of the enemy, who had po&s;&s;e&s;sion of all
the &s;urrounding po&s;ts; and the addre&s;s
and courage with which it was executed
gained him the appellation of the &startq;brave
La Harpe,&endq; a title which was be&s;towed
on him by the General at the head of the
army.</P>
<P>After the expul&s;ion of the coale&s;ced
armies in the North, he fought for more
<PB N="245" REF="252">
active &s;ervice, and took a command in
the army of the Alps. At the &s;iege of
Toulon he was appointed to command
the attack on Fort Pharo, which he
carried by a&s;&s;ault, and forced the Engli&s;h
to evacuate the po&s;t; upon which he was
made General of Brigade.</P>
<P>On his return to the army of Italy, he
took the command of the advanced guard,
and opened the communication with
Genoa, by defeating the Au&s;trians at
Cairo, in 1794. In the beginning of the
following year he was appointed to con|duct
the expedition which was de&s;tined
to relieve Cor&s;ica; but this plan being
relinqui&s;hed, he re&s;umed his former po|&s;ition
in the army of Italy, which, at
this period reduced to two thirds le&s;s
than the Au&s;trian army, was compelled
to retreat. In this perilous &s;ituation, La
Harpe conducted him&s;elf with &s;o much
<PB N="246" REF="253">
&s;kill, as to defeat his pur&s;uers at Vado,
and took &s;uch po&s;itions with his en|feebled
force, that the Au&s;trian General,
who had a&s;&s;ured him&s;elf of the conque&s;t
of Provence, was compelled to give up his
projected inva&s;ion.</P>
<P>La Harpe, now rai&s;ed to the rank of
General of Divi&s;ion, kept po&s;&s;e&s;sion of the
line of defence, which he had traced out,
till reinforcements arrived, and the com|mand
of the army devolved on Buona|parte.</P>
<P>That the military &s;kill and valour of La
Harpe powerfully contributed to en&s;ure
the fir&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;es of that immortal cam|paign,
has been recorded by Buonaparte
him&s;elf, and therefore belongs to hi&s;tory.
The Directory acknowledged the obliga|tions
of the Republic to La Harpe for his
eminent &s;ervices, in formal letters of con|gratulation

to him&s;elf, and his &s;on, a
youth of &s;ixteen years of age, who fought
at his &s;ide. But the mo&s;t noble in&s;tance
of his magnanimity was the friendly and
cordial reception which he gave the
officers of the Swi&s;s regiment of Stetler,
made pri&s;oners at Mandovi, &s;ome of whom

the mid&s;t of his career of glory, La Harpe
fell by the hands of his own &s;oldiers, who
mi&s;took him and his troop, in the dark|ne&s;s
of the night, on their return from
repelling a &s;udden attack of the enemy,
for the enemy them&s;elves. The lo&s;s of
this brave officer overwhelmed the army
with con&s;ternation and &s;orrow. Buona|parte,

<P>THE &s;everity of the government of
Berne towards the members of the fe&s;ti|val
of the fourteenth of July, by the in|troduction
of cannon, and revolutionary
tribunals, called by one of their writers,
&startq;The art of governing po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in an
eminent degree by the admini&s;tration of
Berne, and nearly lo&s;t in the re&s;t of
Europe,&endq; has added an inexhau&s;tible &s;tock
of fuel to that di&s;content, which, Mr.
Cox a&s;&s;erts, led the upper cla&s;&s;es, twenty
years &s;ince, to wi&s;h for a monarchical
government. Their de&s;cendants, how|ever,
partaking of the contagion of the
<PB N="252" REF="259">
times, openly demand, with no tempered
language or di&s;&s;embled phra&s;es, the aid of
a foreign power, to e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;y&s;tem of
republican independence. With this view,
they claim the guarantee made by the
French nation in 1565, in confirmation
of the treaty of Lau&s;anne, concluded the
preceding year between Philibert, the
&s;ucce&s;&s;or of Charles the Third, Duke of
Savoy, and the Swi&s;s Cantons.</P>
<P>In that treaty the Prince made a
formal renunciation of whatever title he
claimed to the Pays de Vaud, upon re|gaining
po&s;&s;e&s;sion of the Pays de Gex,
Bre&s;&s;e, and other di&s;tricts, which con|tinued
to enjoy tho&s;e privileges under
the domination of Savoy and France, of
which their fellow &s;ubjects, the Vaudois,
were deprived under the paternal pro|tection
of the government of Bernc. As
that engagement was cited in the treaty
<PB N="253" REF="260">
of 1582, &s;o all foregoing intermediate
treaties were confirmed by the la&s;t
treaty of 1777, made at Soleure. France,
which, as well as the Hou&s;e of Savoy,
became by tho&s;e treaties the guarantee
of the liberties of the Pays de Vaud, is
now the legal repre&s;entative of that
hou&s;e, by the late peace of 1796. The
popular party in the Pays de Vaud
therefore a&s;&s;ert, that if France, when a
monarchy, protected for more than two
centuries the u&s;urpation of the patricians,
France, now a republic, will fulfil her
engagements in favour of the rights of
the people<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The glory of giving independence to his country, if that event takes place, will chiefly belong to Colonel La Harpe, the cou&s;in of the General. A re|&s;idence of twelve years in the court of Ru&s;&s;ia, and the menaces of the government of Berne, &s;eem only to have &s;trengthened and confirmed in Colonel La Harpe the mo&s;t ardent zeal for the cau&s;e of liberty.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="261">
To incite the government of France to
an examination of the treaties, by which
their liberties are &s;aid to be guaranteed,
they have been indu&s;trious in &s;hewing, not
only how much it is the intere&s;t of the
Republic, that this information &s;hould
take place, but that its honour is engaged
to avenge the numerous in&s;ults and in|juries
committed by the&s;e Cantons during
the pre&s;ent conte&s;t.</P>
<P>But of in&s;ults and injuries the Swi&s;s
al&s;o complain; the ma&s;&s;acre of a part of
their troops on the 10th of Augu&s;t; the
di&s;mi&s;sion of the re&s;t; the withdrawing
the annual &s;ub&s;idy from the catholic Can|tons;
the relea&s;e of the Fribourg in&s;ur|gents
from the gallies; the triumph of
the &s;oldiers of the regiment of Chateau|vieux;
and the <HI>propagande,</HI> have been
urged as grounds of di&s;content, and ju&s;ti|fications
even of enmity.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="262">
To the&s;e charges it has been an&s;wered,
that the ma&s;&s;acre of the Swi&s;s, admitting
it to be a ma&s;&s;acre. was the con&s;equence
of a popular in&s;urrection, in which, as
the Swi&s;s regiment of guards had been
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by the a&s;&s;embly two months
previous to the cata&s;trophe, they ought
not to have taken part. That the di&s;|mi&s;&s;al
of the remainder was become nece&s;|&s;ary
for their own &s;afety; that the hire|ing
of foreign &s;oldiers to fight in a cau&s;e
not their own, was contrary to every
principle of humanity; and that their
di&s;mi&s;&s;al was accompanied with a &s;trict
regard to ju&s;tice in the full indemnities
and pen&s;ions paid to the officers and &s;ol|diers.
With re&s;pect to the other charges,
it is ob&s;erved, that the Con&s;tituent A&s;|&s;embly,
in relea&s;ing the Fribourghers, had
only wiped off the &s;tain of the old go|vernment
which had &s;ent them to the
gallies; that the &s;oldiers of Chateau-vieux
<PB N="256" REF="263">
were the blind dupes of a faction,
and that the dreaded <HI>propagande</HI> never
exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>If, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e explanations, it
be contended, that the balance of national
wrongs were yet again&s;t the French, it is
a&s;&s;erted that the Swi&s;s have amply &s;ettled
the account. From the beginning of the
Revolution, the governments, democra|tical
as well as ari&s;tocratical, h&aacute;ave been
its decided enemies. Not only were the
Swi&s;s &s;oldiers in the &s;ervice of France
compelled, on their temporary vi&s;its to
their country, to dive&s;t them&s;elves of the
national cockade which formed a part of
their uniform, but Frenchmen them&s;elves
were con&s;trained to hide every &s;ymbol
of liberty, in order to avoid being ex|po&s;ed
to in&s;ult. Although affording an
a&s;ylum to the unfortunate is a debt which
both governments and individuals owe to
<PB N="257" REF="264">
humanity, yet the warm welcome given
to the French emigrants by the Cantons
of Berne, Soleure, and Fribourg, might
be con&s;idered by France as an infringe|ment
of national friend&s;hip, if not of
neutrality. It was in the&s;e Cantons that
the emigrant army took its ri&s;e, and
almo&s;t on the French frontier, under
the eyes of the officers of their govern|ments,
that the mo&s;t active agents of the
counter-revolution e&s;tabli&s;hed their offices
of corre&s;pondence. The patricians of
tho&s;e Cantons took part even in the
mea&s;ures of the coalition, although their
in&s;tructions were framed in &s;o indirect a
manner as to be di&s;avowed according to
circum&s;tances. The reality of the engage|ments
they had taken ought further to be
pre&s;umed, from the indirect prai&s;es be|&s;towed
on their conduct, in the famous
an&s;wer addre&s;&s;ed by the French Princes
to Louis the Sixteenth, at the clo&s;e of
<PB N="258" REF="265">
the year 1791, which contained a de|tailed
enumeration of the powers on
which the Monarch might rely for the
re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of his authority. Al|though
complaints were made of this
publication, it is in&s;i&s;ted that the adhe|&s;ion
was not the le&s;s founded, and that
the ce&s;sion of certain portions adjoining
the Swi&s;s territory, was promi&s;ed to the&s;e
Cantons in the general divi&s;ion of France,
which, from the force of the coalition,
it was pre&s;umed would &s;peedily take
place. The&s;e engagements, continue the
reformers, were kept &s;ecret till the inva|&s;ion
of Savoy by the French, when under
pretence of &s;ecuring the independence of
Geneva, the patricians of Berne lined
the frontiers of the department of Ain,
and the Jura, with numerous armies,
intending to pour them into that quarter
as &s;oon as the Pru&s;sians and Au&s;trians,
who were then in Champagne, &s;hould
<PB N="259" REF="266">
have pa&s;&s;ed Chalons. This attempt was
di&s;covered and defeated by the Mini&s;ter
Claviere, to whom, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved,
the Swi&s;s attribute the de&s;ign, not only
of invading Geneva, but of pur&s;uing the
conque&s;t into the territory of the Pays de
Vaud; which project they a&s;&s;ert was pre|vented
by the di&s;obedience of Monte&s;|quieu,
who commanded the French army
in that quarter, and by the moderation of
the Amba&s;&s;ador<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>The&s;e warlike preparations on the part of the Canton of Berne, it is &s;aid, was a mea&s;ure only of &s;elf-defence. Mr. Burke, who is in this ca&s;e an un|doubted authority, informs us, that the Canton of Berne began very early to act on the <HI>defen&s;ive.</HI> The import of this phra&s;e is now pretty generally under|&s;tood. Of the notion which the leading patricians of Berne had of acting on the <HI>defen&s;ive,</HI> &s;omething may be learnt from a letter of M. Mallet du Pan, to Mar&s;hall Ca&s;tries, dated Sept. 17, 1792. By this letter, intercepted and depo&s;ited in the Archives of the French Government, it appears that Swi&s;s troops, on the deliverance of the King from his captivity, of which at that period no doubt was entertained, were to have the exclu&s;ive honour of guarding the royal per&s;on. The writer of this letter ob&s;erves, that as military government mu&s;t for &s;ome time nece&s;&s;arily be e&s;tabli&s;hed in France, it was expedient to appoint &s;uch men to places of confidence, as had &s;ufficient nerve to execute the tru&s;t; and that M. D' Erlach, the Bailiff of Lau&s;anne, whom he regarded as the Providence of the Pays de Vaud, and with whom the French emigrants had found more than protection, had yielded to his repre&s;entations, and demanded from the Count d' Artois the command of the guards.</P>
<P>It may be ob&s;erved, that the actions of individuals ought not to be imputed to the Government, and that M. Mallet du Pan, and M. D' Erlach, might have formed plans and con&s;piracies again&s;t France, which the Government, had it di&s;covered, would have di&s;avowed and reprobated. To this ob&s;ervation it may be re|joined, that although the&s;e plots and con&s;piracies were matters of the mo&s;t public notoriety, they were never di&s;avowed on the part of the Government of Berne; and therefore to prevent &s;uch <HI>providences,</HI> as M. D' Erlach, and M. Mallet du Pan, from acting on the <HI>defen&s;ive,</HI> and &s;uperintending affairs at Paris, would have ju&s;tified the interpo&s;ition of the French, admit|ting that &s;uch interpo&s;ition had ever been intended.</P></NOTE> of France.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="267">
The popular party maintained, that the
Governors of the&s;e Cantons not only
<PB N="261" REF="268">
omitted no occa&s;ion of te&s;tifying their
ho&s;tile di&s;po&s;itions towards the French,
but were guilty of various intractions of
their neutrality. When the manife&s;to
of the coalition, &s;ay they, was an&s;wered
by the proclamation of the exi&s;tence of
the Republic, not only were divers indi|viduals
ordered to quit the Swi&s;s territory,
but the French amba&s;&s;ador was compelled
to leave Soleure, and &s;ubmit to be tole|rated
at Baden. When Denmark, Swe|den,
and even Pru&s;sia, and Spain, had
acknowledged the French Republic, the
patricians of tho&s;e Cantons were &s;tedfa&s;t
in their loyalty to what was called <HI>ex|ternal
France,</HI> its political and eccle&s;ia&s;|tical
<PB N="262" REF="269">
hierarchy, and its king; and the
exi&s;tence of &s;uch a Republic was con|&s;idered
as a capital here&s;y, till the victo|rious
arguments of Moreau and Buona|parte
removed the&s;e fondly cheri&s;hed
&s;cruples.</P>
<P>The arre&s;t of the amba&s;&s;ador Semon|ville,
on the territory of the Gri&s;ons, by
the Au&s;trians, was a manife&s;t violation
of the neutrality, which the French at
that time had not the means of re&s;ent|ing.
This infraction had been preceded
by another, when, on the expul&s;ion of
the Piedmonte&s;e troops from Savoy, a
Swi&s;s regiment effected its e&s;cape acro&s;s
the lake, and returned to join the main
army in the valley of Ao&s;te, through the
territory of Berne, and the Vallais, with|out
any puni&s;hment being inflicted on
the commanders, or the Bailiffs re&s;ident
in that territory. Encouraged by impu|nity,
<PB N="263" REF="270">
the&s;e allies &s;uffered a bolder &s;troke
to be attempted, when the defection of
Dumourier, in 1793, had opened the
northern frontier to the enemy, and the
Republic was torn on every &s;ide by inter|nal
war and divi&s;ions, it was &s;ugge&s;ted that
the inva&s;ion of Savoy, where the French
army was con&s;iderably weakened, would,
independently of the recovery of the
territory, operate a powerful diver&s;ion, and
renew the theatre of war in that part
of France.</P>
<P>The plan of forcing the de&s;iles of
Mount Cenis, and the po&s;t of St. Bernard,
by two &s;trong columns, which &s;hould
penetrate into the Maurienne, and the
Tarentai&s;e, and form their junction
towards Mont-Melian and Chamberry,
was concerted with the march of a third
column from the valley of Ao&s;te to that
of Fau&s;signy, which would render the
<PB N="264" REF="271">
defence of tho&s;e de&s;iles more difficult for
the French, and might even force them
to abandon their po&s;ition. Two ob&s;tacles
&s;eemed to impede this plan; a formida|ble
Glacier, and the Swi&s;s neutrality;
both to all appearance in&s;urmountable:
for if the Glacier could not be &s;caled,
there was no means of reaching the
French but acro&s;s the neutral territory.
The Glacier was inflexible in its neu|trality,
but the King of Sardinia, it ap|pears,
had di&s;covered the di&s;&s;olving tem|perature
of the allies of France, and the
Piedmonte&s;e pilgrims, with their mules
loaded with arms, baggage and amuni|tion,
&s;hook the &s;nows off their feet on the
Swi&s;s &s;ide of the great St. Bernard, and
a&s;cending by the Col de Balme, the la&s;t
boundary of the territory of the Vallais,
re&s;umed the dre&s;s of the &s;oldier, and
aided by the hunters of the country, &s;ur|pri&s;ed
the French in the valley of Fau&s;|&s;igny,
<PB N="265" REF="272">
penetrated to Bonneville, within
five leagues of Geneva, and in three days
were in the rear of the Republican army,
before the French had any knowledge of
the expedition. The &s;ucce&s;s of this plan
would have been complete, and the
French magazines would have been ne|ce&s;&s;arily
taken, had the enterpri&s;e been
&s;upported by reinforcements of cavalry
to keep up the in&s;urrection which had
previou&s;ly been fomented in Savoy.</P>
<P>The want of addre&s;s in the Sardinian
troops, and the valour of the French,
forced the&s;e pilgrims to a &s;econd journey
acro&s;s the Swi&s;s territory, over St. Ber|nard,
which retreat was effected with
the &s;ame open violation of neutrality,
without oppo&s;ition from the Swi&s;s, or
pur&s;uit by the French, although invited
by the people of the lower Vallais to
&s;eize that opportunity of helping them
<PB N="266" REF="273">
to &s;hake off their yoke, for which at|tempt
ten of the in&s;urgents had been
lately hanged, and &s;even &s;ent to the
gallies. As that part of the Swi&s;s terri|tory,
in which the&s;e events took place,
belonged to the government of the
Vallais, the patricians of that di&s;trict
took upon them&s;elves the whole merit
of the enterpri&s;e, in which the go|vernment
of Berne, as if &s;ucceeded &s;o
ill, were not &s;olicitous to claim their
&s;hare.</P>
<P>It is true that the Swi&s;s &s;oldiers who
were employed to aid this expedition,
&s;truck with the di&s;honour of the action, re|volted
again&s;t their commander, and
made complaints, which were prudently
hu&s;hed; it is true al&s;o that this officer
&s;o far incurred the animadver&s;ion of his
government as to provoke a &s;entence
again&s;t him, which it is &s;aid, from its
<PB N="267" REF="274">
mildne&s;s, proved their a&s;&s;ent and appro|bation.
Mr. D' Erlach, the principal in
this project, received a box &s;et in dia|monds
from the King of Sardinia, and
was &s;oon after rai&s;ed to the dignity of
a &s;enator of Berne.</P>
<P>The&s;e are a few among the nume|rous
charges brought by the di&s;contented
chiefs of the Pays de Vaud again&s;t the
governments of Switzerland, particularly
that of their own Canton, in order to
lead the government of France to the
examination how far &s;uch allies are
worthy of the continuance of its friend|&s;hip.
The&s;e popular leaders in&s;i&s;t, at
the &s;ame time, that the Swi&s;s nation
has been guilty of no other offence
again&s;t France than that of being pa&s;sive
and involuntary in&s;truments in the hands
of their ma&s;ters; and that they have in
general di&s;played a lively intere&s;t in
<PB N="268" REF="275">
the fate of France, and the &s;ucce&s;s of
the revolution.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Patriots, while they appear &s;o
&s;olicitous to prompt the French to
avenge their wrongs, do not forget what
is wanting to remedy their own; and
le&s;t the French government &s;hould have
any he&s;itation re&s;pecting the propriety of
interpo&s;ing in the internal concerns of
independent countries, or &s;hould not
&s;eize the full force and meaning of the&s;e
antiquated charters, various precedents
are adduced of the intere&s;t taken by
the patricians of Berne in &s;ettling di&s;|putes
between governors and &s;ubjects in
other &s;tates. Such was their interpo&s;i|tion
in favour of the French monarchy,
again&s;t the Patriots of Geneva; in favour
of the patricians of Fribourg, again&s;t the
inhabitants of the Canton; in favour of
the governors of the upper Vallais, again&s;t
<PB N="269" REF="276">
their &s;ubjects; in favour of the bi&s;hop of
Ba&s;il, again&s;t the people of the bi&s;hop|rick;
in favour of the King of Pru&s;sia,
again&s;t Neufchatel; in favour of the de|mocrats
of Uri, again&s;t the Val de Le|vantine;
and of the burghers of Zurich,
again&s;t the people of the lake.</P>
<P>What rea&s;ons can the government
of Berne produce why other powers
&s;hould not exerci&s;e al&s;o the &s;ame right
of interference with re&s;pect to their
&s;ubjects? e&s;pecially when by written
treaties tho&s;e powers have become &s;ecu|rities
for the pre&s;ervation of their rights?</P>
<P>Such is the long li&s;t of tran&s;gre&s;sions
again&s;t the privileges of equal freedom
which the&s;e Patriots of retentive memory
have brought forward again&s;t the go|vernment
of Berne, and &s;uch the reme|dies
which they propo&s;e for their poli|tical
<PB N="270" REF="277">
evils. Whether the French Re|public
will accede to this invitation, and
render the Pays de Vaud independent
of Berne, is a &s;ecret which the book of
de&s;tiny will perhaps are long unfold.</P>
<P>In the mean time, it is natural to con|clude,
that the principles of that mighty
revolution which have already diffu&s;ed
them&s;elves over remote regions of the
globe, cannot fail to expand in tho&s;e
countries which are placed immediately
within their influence. Since the period
of the French revolution, ages have flitted
before our eyes, and we have ri&s;en &s;ud|denly,
like the offspring of Deucalion,
from infancy to manhood, not without
indications it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, of the
hardened origin whence we &s;prung.
Like the traveller, who from the &s;corch|ing
plains, climbs the rocks that lead
him to the regions of eternal &s;now,
<PB N="271" REF="278">
and finds that in the &s;pace of a few
hours he has pa&s;&s;ed through every &s;uc|ce&s;sive
latitude, from burning heat to
the confines of the frozen pole, the
journey of months; &s;o the human mind,
placed within the &s;phere of the French
revolution, has bounded over the rug|gedne&s;s
of &s;low metaphy&s;ical re&s;earches,
and reached at once, with an incredi|ble

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH, con&s;idered under cer|tain
points of view, nothing can be more
defective than the governments of Swit|zerland,
in which there are no con&s;ti|tutions,
and no criminal laws; where
civil legi&s;lation is incomplete, incon&s;tant
and complicated; where every thing is
arbitrary; where liberty, of which &s;o
vain a boa&s;t has been made, is &s;o lit|tle
under&s;tood; where the ab&s;olute re&s;|traint
put on the pre&s;s, and the into|lerance
exerci&s;ed with re&s;pect to reli|gious
opinions, have &s;tiflted every at|tempt
to promote a more liberal edu|cation,
and fo&s;ter more benevolent and
enlarged &s;entiments; it mu&s;t be re|marked,
that the practice of the&s;e go|vernments
has happily not always cor|re&s;ponded
with their theory. Some|times,
<PB N="273" REF="280">
times, when the &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m
would have exerci&s;ed its fury, the
means of execution have been wanting.
Although accu&s;tomed to the yoke, the
people who bear arms in their hands, a
privilege of no little value, have occa|&s;ionally
hinted to their governors that
they mu&s;t not make that yoke too
heavy. The &s;mallne&s;s of their towns,
the &s;ocial connection of the inhabitants,
the union which exi&s;ts between them
and the inhabitants of the country,
where no intrigue interrupts the har|mony,
have kept alive &s;ome &s;parks of
public &s;pirit &s;ufficient to arre&s;t the
march or interrupt the progre&s;s of tho&s;e
governments towards ab&s;olute de&s;poti&s;m,
independent of other con&s;iderations ari&s;ing
from local or accidental circum&s;tances,
which have often determined them to
moderation.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="281">
Hence we ob&s;erve in Switzerland
more cultivation, ea&s;e and pro&s;perity,
than we &s;hould &s;ee in arbitrary go|vernments
where theory is &s;trengthened
by pratice. But it mu&s;t be remem|bered
that this general effect is no evi|dence
of &s;ecurity to the individual. In
a country where liberty is neither guard|ed
by laws, nor by &s;ocial in&s;titutions,
there may exi&s;t a &s;ort of public mode|ration
which &s;pares the great ma&s;s, but
gives no po&s;itive protection.</P>
<P>The &s;ecurity of the&s;e governments
has ari&s;en from the experience that pri|vate
and in&s;ulated inju&s;tice have cau&s;ed
no general murmur, and they have che|ri&s;hed,
like other governments, the fal&s;e
principle, that becau&s;e they are in mo|tion,
they &s;hall therefore never cea&s;e
to move. The French revolution has
di&s;played the fallacy of this belief; but
<PB N="275" REF="282">
the great changes which have lately
taken place in Italy, are &s;aid to have
had a far more powerful influence on
Switzerland, than all tho&s;e by which
they were preceded; &s;ince the revo|lution
it&s;elf only overthrew an ab&s;olute
monarchy, which admitted of &s;ew points
of compari&s;on with the con&s;titutions of
Switzerland; but the &s;ubver&s;ion of tho&s;e
ari&s;tocracies, which have always been re|pre&s;ented
as happy models of a part of
the Swi&s;s governments, have awakened
new ideas in that country, of which the
effects are already &s;en&s;ibly perceived.
Should a &s;park from the blaze of French
liberty fall on tho&s;e combu&s;tible mate|rials,
it may kindle into a flame; and
if it be the policy of the French Re|public
to give it&s;elf a moral as well as
a geographical frontier, its friendly in|tercour&s;e
with Switzerland will pro|bably
mould the various governments of
<PB N="276" REF="283">
that country into forms of nearer &s;imi|litude
to its own.</P>
<P>In the preceding &s;ketch, &s;ufficiently
imperfect from the inability of the writer,
many voluntary omi&s;sions will al&s;o be
ob&s;erved. I have &s;aid nothing of the
Confederation which binds the Cantons of
Switzerland together; of the barbarous
policy &s;o well known, and &s;o often re|probated,
of &s;elling the lives of their ci|tizens
to foreign powers; and have en|tered
into no detailed hi&s;tory of its go|vernments,
becau&s;e I wi&s;hed carefully
to avoid telling what others have told
better.</P>
<P>With &s;incere reluctance I bade Swit|zerland
farewell. Who can leave &s;uch a
country without regret? If we find its
governments defective, or its &s;ocieties
dull, there is always a re&s;ource again&s;t
<PB N="277" REF="284">
every feeling of di&s;like, or of wearine&s;s,
in the meditation of that glorious &s;cenery,
the view of which renders the mind in|&s;en&s;ible
to human evils, by lifting it be|yond
their reach. Switzerland has opened
to me a new world of ideas; its land|&s;capes
are indelibly impre&s;&s;ed upon my
memory; whenever the delighful images
of nature pre&s;ent them&s;elves to my ima|gination
I find that I have been thinking
only of Switzerland; and whenever I
amu&s;e my&s;elf in that &s;ort of vi&s;ionary ar|chitecture,
called ca&s;tle-building, my cha|teau
is always &s;eated at the foot of an
Alpine hill, a torrent &s;tream rolls invi&s;ibly
pa&s;t the dwelling, and an enormous gla|cier
lifts its &s;nows in the neighbourhood.</P>
<P>In that memorable winter, which
turned the waters of Holland into dry
ground, we pa&s;&s;ed through Franche
Comt&eacute;, on our way to Paris; not without
<PB N="278" REF="285">
con&s;iderable danger from the wolves, which
the &s;everity of the fro&s;t had brought down
from the Jura into the plains, and impelled
to attack the unguarded traveller.</P>
<Q><L>&startq;Cruel as death, and hungry as the grave,</L>
<L>Burning for blood! bony, and gaunt, and grim!&endq;</L></Q>
<P>A general thaw which took place the
night we reached Be&s;anson, and rendered
the roads for &s;ome days impa&s;&s;able, de|tained
us agreeably with the accompli&s;hed
and ho&s;pitable family of one of my fellow
travellers.</P>
<P>I returned to Paris, and to my family,
with feelings how different from tho&s;e I
had felt on my departure! I had now only
&s;cenes of gratulation to witne&s;s, and only

<P>TWENTY ages &s;ince, when Rome, for
the fir&s;t time, ca&s;t a look towards tho&s;e
unknown regions, whence i&s;&s;ued the bar|barous
nations who were mo&s;t the ob|jects
of her dread, &s;he beheld, with a&s;to|ni&s;hment,
a chain of &s;ummits, bolder than
Cauca&s;us, eternally covered with the &s;nows
of winter. The civilized world, for a
while, believed that Italy was joined by
<PB N="280" REF="287">
the Alps to the frozen pole of the
North<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Polybius, Book II.</NOTE></P>
<P>Whil&s;t the Romans were contemplating
the&s;e Mountains, Hannibal &s;caled them.
He found, as he had conjectured, that the
whole of their &s;urface was not covered
with &s;nows, and was led by their &s;avage,
but free inhabitants, acro&s;s their wild pa&s;|turages,
hidden amid&s;t ma&s;&s;es of rocks,
and the Romans di&s;covered that they were
not invincible.</P>
<P>It is not yet preci&s;ely determined over
what parts of the mountains the Cartha|ginians
pa&s;&s;ed; nor can we form any ju&s;t
idea of the &s;tate of the Alps at the time
of their pa&s;&s;age, &s;ince we know not to
what places we ought to apply the de|&s;criptions
given by the hi&s;torians who
<PB N="281" REF="288">
have tran&s;mitted to us the account of this
a&s;toni&s;hing expedition. All that we can
conclude from what they have related, is,
that the Alps had at that time reached
their period of old age; hills had filled up
vallies; regular &s;lopes had become abrupt
precipices; va&s;t ma&s;&s;es rent from their &s;ides,
indicated their decay, and the regions of ice
which Hannibal cro&s;&s;ed, were no doubt
the conque&s;ts made by the higher glaciers
over the territory beneath. This is all that
hi&s;tory records, but in what annals &s;hall we
trace the youth of the&s;e elde&s;t daughters
of the earth? To what remote period &s;hall
we revert, to di&s;cover the infancy of what
for &s;o many centuries has pa&s;&s;ed the boun|daries
of old age? If a frail machine, the
work of an in&s;tant, which moves, which
feels, which &s;uffers, which lives, which
with all its force and energies ha&s;tens to
decay; if man counts by years, by what
numbers or lap&s;es of time &s;hall tho&s;e pa&s;|&s;ive
<PB N="282" REF="289">
in&s;en&s;ible ma&s;&s;es be computed, which
are formed to re&s;i&s;t, like the globe of
which they are a part, that de&s;olation
which changes, without intermi&s;sion, the
beautiful &s;cenery of its external form?</P>
<P>Let us then no longer regret the lo&s;s of
facts which hi&s;torians have omitted to
mention; what information &s;hould we
gain from annals of &s;uch recent date?
What are &s;uch points of compari&s;on, at
the di&s;tance only of a few ages from each
other? But there is another hi&s;tory, in
which the records of nations occupies but
an imperceptible &s;pace, the hi&s;tory of
nature. The mind of genius, which can
read its characters, bounds, at one &s;tep,
over the limits of our &s;hort and dubious
page, and leaving at a remote di&s;tance both
nations, and their earlie&s;t convul&s;ions,
plunges into antiquity far beyond their
ken; di&s;covers its periods, and fixes the
<PB N="283" REF="290">
epochas of its revolutions. From the
&s;hores of the &s;ea he departs; there he col|lects
tho&s;e facts which are mo&s;t recent;
he marks the ye&s;terday of nature; for na|tions
in his &s;ight are but the beings of the
day. He then approaches the hills which
ri&s;e up from the &s;hores, tho&s;e which the
waters la&s;t formed when they finally with|drew
from the land. Tho&s;e are long pa|rallel,
and but little elevated lines, the
work of the waters in their &s;low retreat,
for when the ocean left them behind, it
had lo&s;t its primitive fury, tending with
le&s;s impetuo&s;ity towards the hollow which
it now fills.</P>
<P>As he advances, the mountains rai&s;e their
heads, and branch off in different chains,
the various directions of which leave traces
of the &s;truggles of the waters. Here,
broad and deep vallies mark the currents;
a raging &s;ea has wa&s;hed the cliffs and pre|cipices
<PB N="284" REF="291">
above. Va&s;t banks of &s;hells and
vegetable productions, are proofs of the
long abode which the water has made,
and their petrifaction bears te&s;timony to
the number of years which have clap&s;ed
&s;ince the &s;ea has left them.</P>
<P>In a loftier region, every object a&s;&s;umes
a bolder &s;hape; every thing indicates more
violent convul&s;ions, di&s;covers mightier
operations, and leads us back to antiquity
&s;till more remote. Every &s;tep of eleva|tion

<P>Whatever, in fine, may be the various

I think we ought to look on that
as the mo&s;t probable, which e&s;tabli&s;hes
the mo&s;t uniform and con&s;tant cau&s;e.
Nothing indeed is more regular than the
law of nature; and the law which &s;epa|rates
the living world from the region of
<PB N="297" REF="304">
&s;now, is indicated in all latitudes, by an
imaginary &s;urface, which is 2400 fathoms
higher than the level of the &s;ea above
the equator, and which gradually ap|proaching
the earth, cuts the real &s;urface
near the eightieth degree of latitude.</P>
<P>If we apply this rule to the Alps, we
&s;hall find that, &s;ituated at a di&s;tance
from the equator, which exceeds the
half of its di&s;tance from the pole, they
ought to meet the region of the &s;nows
at a height le&s;s than half that of the
elevation of this region above the &s;eas
of the equator; whence it follows, that
if the Alps had pre&s;erved their ori|ginal
form, we &s;hould have &s;een their
chain covered with a &s;tratum of &s;now, the
lower borders of which would be fairly cut
by the region of vegetation at 1100 fa|thoms
above the level of the &s;ea. The
&s;ituation alone of &s;ome &s;ummits, relatively
to the a&s;pect of the &s;un, and the activity
<PB N="298" REF="305">
which the rays of this luminary acquire
from the reflection of certain &s;urfaces on
their neighbouring bodies, would interrupt
by a &s;mall number of irregularities, the
unvaried whitene&s;s of this long ridge of
fro&s;ts.</P>
<P>If this &s;tate has exi&s;ted, it could only
have exi&s;ted for a very &s;hort period, &s;ince
the forms are continually changing to
&s;ettle into a regular &s;hape. The ma&s;s of
ice having begun to collect, mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily
have augmented; and if there was
but one year in which the&s;e &s;ummits
harboured &s;nows, part of which re&s;i&s;ted
the action of the &s;un, this mu&s;t be the
cau&s;e why, at that height, they &s;hould
not melt in proportion to their accumula|tion.
Now the ma&s;s and weight of the&s;e
ices could not have increa&s;ed, without de|taching
from the main body enormous
portions, which, rolling down the &s;lope of
the mountains, have carried winter into
<PB N="299" REF="306">
warmer regions, where they have pre|&s;erved
them&s;elves by means of their ex|tent,
again&s;t the heats of &s;ummer. Tor|rents
have multiplied in proportion to the
increa&s;e of the ice, and its approach to|wards
the temperate zone; they have car|ried
away the &s;oil that covered the brow
of the hills, and made way for ob&s;cure
precipices, down which the&s;e rami$ications
of ice have been lengthened from the
higher &s;ummits, and which are de&s;tined
to lay wa&s;te the lower mountains, and re|unite
in a continued chain the glaciers,
till then fettered on their in&s;ulated tops.</P>
<P>Such is the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the Alps.
If it was po&s;sible to rai&s;e our&s;elves above
their &s;ummits, and take in at one view
the whole ma&s;s, the fertile parts would di&s;|appear
before tho&s;e which are uninha|bitable.
Two principal &s;eas of ice, bor|dering
on each other, would at fir&s;t fix
<PB N="300" REF="307">
our attention, the one to the north ea&s;t,
and the other to the &s;outh we&s;t. In the
fir&s;t we &s;hould perceive the mountains
linked together from St. Gothard, and the
Grim&s;el, on to the Shreek-horn, like
i&s;lands half deluged; on the other &s;ide.
we &s;hould di&s;tingui&s;h, under an uniform
livery, the formidable range of tho&s;e &s;um|mits
which rai&s;e them&s;elves from St. Ber|nard,
and Mount-Velan, on to Mount
Blanc. From tho&s;e two &s;eas we &s;hould
&s;ee a multitude of arms branch off, which
by meeting again, mingling together and
uniting in different directions, bind the
great ma&s;&s;es to tho&s;e which are of le&s;s
magnitude, and invade every territory
which borders on the&s;e regions of fro&s;t.</P>
<P>In this uniformity of whitene&s;s, we
&s;hould remark a few points of a different
colour, and which encha&s;ed in the ice,
&s;eem to have kept their &s;ummits free;
<PB N="301" REF="308">
the&s;e &s;ummits, without doubt, were here|tofore
covered; but their &s;keleton be|coming
in cour&s;e of time incapable of re|taining
its cloathing, nature relieved their
old age from the common &s;ervitude. A
few black &s;pots would indicate the places
of cultivation and pa&s;turage; but we
&s;hould &s;eek in vain for tho&s;e imper|ceptible
inter&s;tices through which men
have made pa&s;&s;ages; and the Valais, the
greate&s;t interval which the ice has left,
would appear nothing more than a nar|row
ribband, &s;ilvered by the Rhone.</P>
<P>If we look nearer, and ob&s;erve its par|tial
effects, this deluge of ice appears &s;till
more formidable. We &s;ee it &s;wallowing
up in &s;ucce&s;sion the&s;e va&s;t wrecks of
every age, each portion of which bears
evidence of the ravages of a century.
Stretched out like the veil of oblivion
over the&s;e records of nature, it threatens
<PB N="302" REF="309">
with de&s;truction every ve&s;tige which time
has left in its pa&s;&s;age. Into whatever
valley I penetrate, I &s;ee my&s;elf &s;ur|rounded
by ice; it menaces every com|munication;
the mo&s;t fruitful pa&s;turages
are threatened with its inva&s;ions; and the
&s;hepherds, hemmed in between the &s;paces
which remain, point out to us, with &s;ighs,
tho&s;e which have been &s;ubdued. Like
torrents, if it had their rapidity and in|con&s;tancy;
or lavas, if it did not bring in
its train all the horrors of an eternal
winter, the ice follows every declivity,
accumulates in every depth, and pre&s;ents
it&s;elf like an immen&s;e volume, the de|&s;cent
of which is determined by its
weight. The inhabitant of the plain be|holds
with a&s;toni&s;hment the invader pro|truding
amid&s;t his harve&s;ts, bid defiance
even to the &s;un by which they are
ripened; the &s;hepherd, &s;eeking refuge at
the foot of precipices, perceives it with
<PB N="303" REF="310">
terror, mounting the tops of the &s;teep
which &s;eparated him from it, and de|luging
his abode with torrents and ava|lanches.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t allow, however melancholy
be the fact, that the ice is gaining on the
whole &s;urface of the high Alps, and is
tending to in&s;ulate the more temperate
vallies which they inclo&s;e. I will not
&s;ay that their increa&s;e is any proof of the
refrigeration of the globe; for the Glaciers
have in general gone far beyond the
colder region which has produced them,
and &s;ub&s;i&s;t by means of their extent in
a warmer zone; but the &s;ituation it&s;elf
of the&s;e Glaciers, in places which could
not have given them birth, is &s;ufficient to
prove the exten&s;ion of their original
ma&s;s<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">When we attribute to the increa&s;e alone of the upper regions of &s;now, the exten&s;ion of which is ob|&s;erved in the lower Glaciers, and regard the &s;y&s;tem of the refrigeration of the earth as ill fitted to explain the abode of the&s;e ma&s;&s;es in a temperate region, I am far from imagining that this manner of con&s;idering an in|&s;ulated fact is in contradiction to the mo&s;t magnificent theory of the world which genius has ever produced.

The influence which the accumulation
of the Glaciers of the high region has on
the lower Glaciers, is &s;een in the pro|gre&s;sive
march of the latter. It is ea&s;y to
conceive the cau&s;e: a ma&s;s which weighs
on an inclined plane, has a nece&s;&s;ary
tendency to de&s;cend; and this tendency
is favoured in the Glaciers by the &s;hock
of torrents, which roll under their cavities,
by the humidity which their ma&s;s com|municates
to the &s;oil which &s;upports
them; and finally by that innumerable
multitude of hollows which undermine
<PB N="311" REF="318">
their lower part, the effect of which is
the diminution of the friction by di|mini&s;hing
the extent of the &s;urfaces. It
is thus that the increa&s;e, which in reality
takes place only on the heights, feeds
the ramifications, which, being &s;ituated
in the temperate regions, lo&s;e much
without gaining, and al&s;o gradually aug|ments
tho&s;e Glaciers that have not yet
pa&s;&s;ed beyond the icy band of mountains,
which they one day will pa&s;s, to de&s;olate
warmer countries. It is at Mareme, or
Moraine, to that ma&s;s of fragments of
rocks which bounds the foot of the Gla|ciers,
that we are indebted for the di&s;|covery
of their progre&s;s. It was ob&s;erved
that this ridge was compo&s;ed chiefly of
pieces of granite, although the rocks
around the Glacier were all calcareous,

found that they imperceptibly advanced
towards its extremity, and that a mark
fixed above one of the&s;e crevices, had
in a &s;hort time overrun a con&s;iderable
&s;pace<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>It is in the Glaciers of Faucigny that the&s;e ob|&s;ervations have been made, where firs, &s;tuck in the crevices of the ice, have &s;erved as points of com|pari&s;on. One of the mo&s;t deci&s;ive experiments of this kind was made by M. Hennin, then French Mini&s;ter at Geneva. It appears from all tho&s;e that have hitherto been made, that the progre&s;s of the ice is about four|teen feet every year. This progre&s;s is enormous; and it is ea&s;y to perceive that a tendency &s;o deci&s;ive would be productive of the mo&s;t terrible effects, if the elevation was every where the &s;ame, and if different cau&s;es did not unite to counteract it; but it is not po&s;&s;ible for this law to be univer&s;al; it mu&s;t vary according to the de&s;cent and the direction of the val|lies of ice; and la&s;tly, according to the pre&s;&s;ure of the upper ma&s;&s;es, and the direction of that pre&s;&s;ure. Be|&s;ides, the temperature of the region of the Glaciers modifies in &s;ome mea&s;ure their progre&s;s; the &s;oil more or le&s;s moi&s;tened by the melting of the ice, favours more or le&s;s its de&s;cent; &s;o that the lower ramifica|tions, loaded with the enormous weight of the &s;nows of the higher region, &s;ituated in vallies, the de&s;cent of which being long and &s;teep, and undermined by the torrents which collect beneath their cavities, mu&s;t proceed much more rapidly than tho&s;e which inhabit the icy region; and this increa&s;e of rapidity, owing to their &s;ituation, is at the &s;ame time the means which nature has employed to repair the rapid lo&s;&s;es to which they are &s;ubjected by their po&s;ition, whil&s;t the &s;low|ne&s;s of the progre&s;s of the upper Glaciers prevents the prodigious increa&s;e which that po&s;ition would admit. By the&s;e means, the ma&s;s of the high region, finding its exten&s;ion more circum&s;cribed on the &s;ide of the higher vallies, throws it&s;elf chiefly towards the lower outlets, where its extremities are &s;ometimes kept in a &s;tate of di&s;&s;olution; &s;o that the annual increa&s;e of the &s;nows, however great, produces but an imperceptible increa&s;e in the Glaciers, and is &s;ometimes annihilated by the caprices of the &s;ea&s;ons.</P>
<P>Dr. Darwin, alarmed by the increa&s;e of the ice at the northern pole, and on the Swi&s;s mountains, has pointed out an ingenious and beneficent mode of re|&s;toring the equilibrium of heat and cold, by employ|ing the fleets of Europe, now bu&s;ied in deva&s;tation, in the more innocent occupation of navigating ice i&s;lands from the neighbourhood of the pole, to cool the feveri&s;h climates of the track of the &s;un. As the con|tinential armies are about to cea&s;e their work of death, the Doctor might al&s;o have propo&s;ed their being en|gaged in the removal of the Glaciers of St. Gothard, or Mont Blanc, had not M. Ramond, in his late ob|&s;ervations on the Pyrenees, relieved us from any ap|prehen&s;ion on account of the threatened progre&s;&s;ive refrigeration of the globe from the increa&s;e of the ice on the Glaciers. After having de&s;canted on the cau&s;es of the variety, the breadth, and elevation of the icy zone on the Alps, and the Pyrenees, and which is only three hundred fathom on the latter, while it occupies a &s;pace of thirteen hundred fathom on the former; (a wonderful difference, he adds, if we reflect that the mo&s;t elevated &s;ummits of the&s;e mountains differ only &s;ix hundred fathom in their height, and only three degrees and a half in their latitude.) M. Ramond draws the following inductions, that from the height which the peaks of a chain of mountains attain, from its mean latitude, and the extent of its icy zone, two points being given, a third may be concluded; and that if in a known chain, from a given mountain, two of the&s;e circum&s;tances are a&s;certained, its height, the extent of its &s;nows, or ice, and the place which it holds in the links of the chain, the third is a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence.</P>
<P>M. Ramond, after having e&s;tabli&s;hed the&s;e rules, endeavours to prove that the Glaciers of the Alps, like tho&s;e of the Pyrenees, are not &s;u&s;ceptible of any durable increa&s;e beneath the icy zone. Let the Gla|cier roll its waves towards every outlet&mdash;vain menace!&mdash;it is like the &s;treamlet which ru&s;hes head|long from the lofty precipice, and is le$t in air. A carpet of flowers forms a boundary to the &s;ea of ice which it cannot pa&s;s; the harve&s;t of the hu&s;bandman waves in &s;afety on its banks, and the &s;hepherd's but need not fear its vicinity. The fury of the ocean is not more certainly re&s;trained by the gently &s;loping beach, where the foaming waters, that &s;hake the rocks, and da&s;h again&s;t them like the &s;light canoe of the Indian, the &s;tately ve&s;&s;el loaded with legions and their thunder, die away on the lightly-&s;hifting &s;ands, where they &s;carcely move the &s;hell which they have thrown.</P></NOTE>.</P>

This mode of increa&s;ing and multiply|ing

<PB N="315" REF="322">

New Glaciers are &s;ometimes formed
in hollows, that are le&s;s expo&s;ed to the
&s;un, where the &s;now of winter is pre|&s;erved
by the ma&s;s which the heat

the inhabitants of the Alps refer to when
they advance it as an axiom, that a
Glacier &s;prings up wherever a portion of
&s;now, however &s;mall, has remained for
the &s;pace of a year.</P>
<P>The regular &s;teps which I have ju&s;t
traced, the &s;low progre&s;s which draws
imperceptibly to the foot of the Alps,
the &s;now which their &s;ummits have col|lected,
is at once the origin of the Gla|ciers,
and the cau&s;e of their duration.
If the &s;nows invariably remained in their
native region, and received no other in|crea&s;e
than was &s;ufficient to repair the
lo&s;s occa&s;ioned by evaporation, Switzer|land
would have no ice, and would no
longer furni&s;h to the four &s;eas which &s;ur|round
Europe, the fine&s;t rivers of this
part of the world. If, on the contrary,
<PB N="318" REF="325">
the&s;e &s;ame &s;nows fell &s;uddenly into the
lower vallies, before they had taken the
con&s;i&s;tence which they r&egrave;ceive in the
middle region, by the &s;ucce&s;sion of fro&s;t
and thaw, their di&s;&s;olution would be as
rapid as their fall, and they would &s;oon
di&s;appear with the furious torrents they
would have formed. It is not thus that
nature acts. She has de&s;tined the mo&s;t
elevated country of Europe to be the
waterer of its &s;urface; but this watering,
in order to prove a benefit, mu&s;t be regu|lar.
The &s;nows which accumulate in
the&s;e lofty regions ought to be &s;low and
uniform in melting. In order to melt,
they mu&s;t de&s;cend into a lower region of
the atmo&s;phere; to melt &s;lowly, they
mu&s;t be in great ma&s;&s;es, and under a very
&s;olid form; they mu&s;t take the con|&s;i&s;tence
of the harde&s;t ice. Let us fol|low
their &s;ingular transformation in its
details.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="326">
The highe&s;t mountains, tho&s;e which
are properly known under the name of
<HI>Glacieres,</HI> are ab&s;olutly inacce&s;sible; but
the experienced beholder di&s;tingui&s;hes in
the brilliant whitene&s;s of their covering,
that dazzling which is the characteri&s;tic
of &s;now. In reality, nothing falls from
the clouds but &s;now, and that which
adheres to the&s;e elevated points, never
having undergone a real thaw, mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily
remain in this form, or be co|vered
only with a &s;ight varni&s;h of im|perfect
ice, cau&s;ed by the agglutination
of the parts of the &s;urface mo&s;t expo&s;ed
to the &s;un. It is this dazzling incru&s;ta|tion
which has deceived many ob&s;ervers,
with re&s;pect to the nature of the clothing
of the&s;e mountains. All the parts of this
clothing very ea&s;ily &s;eparate from each
other, and fall often into icy du&s;t at the
bottom of the neighbouring and &s;urround|ing
mountains. This is the fir&s;t &s;tate of
<PB N="320" REF="327">
the upper &s;nows, and the fir&s;t &s;tep which
they take towards the inferior vallies.</P>
<P>Directly beneath the&s;e mountains, and
in that elevated hollow, which receives
at the &s;ame time their &s;poils, and the
&s;nows of the atmo&s;phere, the tempera|ture
is le&s;s icy, the &s;un has &s;ome in|fluence,
and a few days of thaw &s;u&s;pend
the rigours of winter; we then find the
&s;now more conden&s;ed, more adhe&s;ive; it
keeps from &s;inking, but the trace of the
foot is pre&s;erved. This is the immen&s;e
re&s;ervoir of the Glaciers. An infinity of
branches e&s;cape in every direction along
the &s;teep vallies towards the plain. Their
&s;nows elaborated in the hollow above,
and become &s;olid, are fitted to bear the
trial which they undergo in a more tem|perate
region. The &s;econd &s;tep is ac|compli&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="328">
In this new abode, the &s;nows are ex|po&s;ed
to longer thaws, but the fro&s;ts are
&s;carcely le&s;s &s;harp; their ma&s;&s;es are more
thoroughly penetrated with the water
which is produced by the di&s;&s;olution of
&s;ome of its parts; but when it is duly
moi&s;tened, the cold &s;eizes, and trans|forms
it into a kind of half ice, which
already &s;eems tran&s;parent; this is the ori|gin
of the Glaciers.</P>
<P>The work is not yet fini&s;hed, but it
goes on rapidly to perfection. Every
fathom of de&s;cent towards the lower re|gion
gives the ice a greater degree of
hardne&s;s and tran&s;parency, and the Gla|cier,
undergoing a thorough transforma|tion
pre&s;erves nothing that bears a re|&s;emblance
of its original.</P>
<P>If, in the mean time, we ca&s;t an atten|tive
look over the part where the trans|formation
<PB N="322" REF="329">
is mo&s;t perfect, namely, at the
foot of the Glacier, we &s;hall perceive
that that is not ab&s;olutely homogeneous,
but compo&s;ed of two very different kinds
of ice. That which forms the lower
&s;tratum being more compact and more
tran&s;parent, is of an hardne&s;s &s;urpa&s;sing
that of our mo&s;t perfect ice; it is al&s;o
like it in other re&s;pects, terminated by
plane &s;ufaces; but that which forms
it&s;elf into irregular rocks, the outward
&s;urface of which is rugged, being more
white and light, as well as le&s;s &s;olid, is
ea&s;ily divided into globular fragments,
which are them&s;elves only an aggrega|tion
of &s;imilar parts. The lower bed of
ice is therefore the produce of water,
regularly cry&s;tallized, whil&s;t the other is
nothing more than &s;now, the particles
of which are agglutinated by the &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion
of thaws and fro&s;ts. This is, I be|lieve,
the cau&s;e of that phaenomenon.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="330">
The &s;now, as it falls to the ground, is
a ma&s;s of little regular cry&s;tals, in the
form of very light and &s;cooped out &s;tars,
the &s;ix rays of which being flat, pointed,
and di&s;tant &s;ixty degrees from each other,
pre&s;ent the form of the cry&s;tallization of
water. Let us imagine the effect which
the heat mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have on their
accumulated flakes, we &s;hall find that the
mo&s;t unconnected parts are tho&s;e which
yield the &s;oone&s;t, the points will drop off,
a little &s;pherical nucleus is all that remains
of each &s;tar, and the whole ma&s;s will &s;ink
by the union of the&s;e globules. It is in
this &s;tate that tho&s;e &s;nows are every where
found which have undergone a fir&s;t thaw;
they then become le&s;s porous, and more
tran&s;parent. But if this thaw be &s;ucceeded
by fro&s;t, the little &s;pherical icicles cling
together, and form an icy ma&s;s, which
breaks at each &s;inuous inter&s;tice, which the
elementary globules leave between them.
<PB N="324" REF="331">
Such is the ice which compo&s;es the upper
&s;tratum of the glaciers. The lower &s;tratum
is formed by the congelation of the waters,
which have filtered through the &s;now; it
takes the figure of perfect ice; its ma&s;s is
a &s;eries of flat and uniformly inclined
planes; it is hard, tran&s;parent, and breaks
into &s;harp fragments<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Among the&s;e lower &s;trata of ice, &s;ome parts are found of a deeper blue, much harder, heavier, and more indi&s;&s;oluble, than the mo&s;t &s;olid ice we know of. The&s;e properties ari&s;e from their antiquity, and the continual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of di&s;&s;olution and congelation which they undergo. Their parts become gradually more con|nected; they have expelled or di&s;&s;olved all the particles of heterogeneous air, which di&s;turbed their tran&s;parency, or dimini&s;hed their adhe&s;ion; remaining therefore unmix|ed with any foreign matter, they have acquired that blue colour which belongs to air and water, when they form a volume, and hold no other fluid in &s;u&s;pen&s;ion. M. Plyffer has made &s;everal experiments on this ice, which I have not yet repeated. He a&s;&s;erts, that it retains its colour to its &s;malle&s;t fragments. He has al&s;o remarked its property of re&s;i&s;ting heat. I have made the &s;ame ob&s;ervation, and have admired the wi&s;dom of nature, which has given this ice hardne&s;s, and indi&s;&s;olubility, fitted to make it &s;upport the abode of the warm vallies into which it de&s;cends.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is not, as is commonly believed, dur|ing
the heats of &s;ummer, that the&s;e tran&s;|formations
take place; they are only un|dergoing
<PB N="325" REF="332">
preparation. The &s;now is &s;atu|rated
with water; but the cold of the
night is not &s;ufficiently piercing to fini&s;h
the work; it penetrates but a little way;
the thaw is but &s;lightly re&s;trained, it is the
winter alone which fixes it, and freezes
what the &s;ummer has di&s;&s;olved. Thence
it happens, that during the tempe|rate
&s;ea&s;on a prodigious quantity of wa|ter
e&s;capes congelation; makes its way
on every &s;ide through the ma&s;s of &s;nows;
its weight determines it towards the ex|tremities;
there it finds either re&s;ervoirs,
<PB N="326" REF="333">
which di&s;tribute it into the bowels of
mountains to feed the &s;prings, or decli|vities
down which it ru&s;hes, dragging
along a part of the &s;now drowned in it,
and forcing a channel, to empty it&s;elf
into the plains. In vain are the&s;e pervi|ous
&s;nows afterwards changed into ice;
they pre&s;erve the form which has been
impre&s;&s;ed on them; the torrent &s;eizing on
its bed, and endued with an impetuo&s;ity
proportioned to the rapidity of its de&s;cent,
acquires the power of overcoming the
tran&s;itory ob&s;tacles which accident might
bring in its way. The glacier, in its pro|gre&s;s,
is forced to pre&s;erve for it an outlet
which it would otherwi&s;e find the means
of opening for it&s;elf; or rather let me &s;ay,
that the glacier is formed by its current;
its de&s;cent is favoured by the &s;hock, and
the rapidity of its waters; the torrent
traces out the places which it is to occupy&punc;
<PB N="327" REF="334">
and becomes the pioneer that prepares de|&s;erts
for its reception.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t nature is making this external
expenditure, to fertilize our plains burnt
up by the heats of &s;ummer, &s;he looks for|ward
to winter to repleni&s;h her re&s;ervoirs;
it is in hollows deprived, to all appear|ance,
of outlet, that &s;he accumulates the
waters, which a thou&s;and unknown pipes
convey into interior cavities, whence
they i&s;&s;ue under the form of &s;prings,

cold, but have often acquired a heat fo|reign
to their nature, the cau&s;e of which
is demon&s;trated by the numerous hot
&s;prings we find in Switzerland. The &s;ame
&s;ubterraneous &s;ources from which they
flow, tho&s;e &s;emi-volcanoes kept up by
the &s;low and gradual fermentation of the
va&s;t magazines of minerals heaped up in
the bo&s;om of the Alps, are the origin al&s;o
<PB N="328" REF="335">
of tho&s;e accidental cavities, which are dug
under the glaciers already formed, and of
that verdure which we are &s;ometimes &s;ur|pri&s;ed
to find in places which ought to be co|vered
with eternal &s;nows; la&s;tly, we are in|debted
to them for a great number of rivulets,
kept up by the melting of the ice during the
&s;harpe&s;t cold of winter, and which &s;eizing
on the bed of the torrents, &s;weep their
cour&s;e, and keep their outlets free. It is
to the&s;e receptacles of heat, and by the
partial &s;inkings which they occa&s;ion in
the ma&s;s of the glaciers, that we mu&s;t
attribute a part of the great crevices
which cro&s;s them in every direction, and
which receiving the waters of the upper
&s;urface, carry them into the lower canals.
It is al&s;o to the vaults made by their hot
exhalations under the glaciers, that we
might attribute the formation of bridges
of ice, interior lakes, and a thou&s;and
other accidents, which, becau&s;e they are
<PB N="329" REF="336">
accidents, can have no con&s;tant cau&s;e,
and ought not therefore to be ranged in
the cla&s;s of phaenomena ari&s;ing from the
heat peculiar to the earth. This heat
is an uniform and univer&s;al cau&s;e, and
therefore can have only uniform and uni|ver&s;al
effects.</P>
<P>If this heat acted only on the lower
part of the glaciers, it would act always
regularly, their ma&s;s would &s;ink every

which &s;hould proceed from their melting
would give equal moi&s;ture to all the
countries they covered; they would run
off indifferently from all parts of the ice
which touch the ground, and would re|unite
only after their fall. There would
be no partial and extraordinary cavities, no
&s;eparate re&s;ervoirs; none of tho&s;e privi|leged

the waters, left to their own weight and
fluidity, unite together, when no ob&s;tacle
occurs to prevent their tendency, and be|ing
likewi&s;e only the mouth of a channel
which pierces the glacier through its
whole length, they prove nothing, except
the little re&s;i&s;tance which the drench|ed

and the <HI>Furca;</HI> their &s;ources are in the
upper &s;nows, but they owe to the chan|nel
which receives them, and which con|veys
them to the plains, after having for a
long time concealed them from &s;ight,
tho&s;e auxiliary waters which its numerous
crevices bring them from all parts of the
glacier; &s;o that the increa&s;e of the tor|rent
ari&s;es as much from the upper &s;ur|face

even conclude, that the produce of the
external thaw is not incon&s;iderable, if we
ob&s;erve that the furrows, by which it is
hollowed, as well as its bri&s;tled points, are
the work of the currents which are formed
<PB N="332" REF="339">
in the fir&s;t days of &s;pring; and which
would continue running, if the cavities,
by giving way &s;oon after, did not ab&s;orb
them as they ari&s;e, and conduct them
into the lower channel.</P>
<P>After having de&s;cribed the general
forms which the glaciers owe to their
origin, I &s;hall not &s;top to paint the infi|nite
varieties which di&s;tingui&s;h them;
they are as numerous as the places where
they are &s;ituated, and the circum&s;tances
by which they are attended.</P>
<P>In this &s;pot, a band of ice, adhering to
a precipice, drops off in proportion as the
fun communicates warmth to its &s;up|porter,
and pre&s;ents it&s;elf, &s;een &s;ideways,
like a tran&s;parent needle, &s;o extremely
elevated, that its equilibrium appears a
miracle. On another &s;ide, a ma&s;s of ice,
on the edge of a precipice, leans like a
<PB N="333" REF="340">
penthou&s;e over the depth, and turns it&s;elf
into a half circle. Sometimes this pent|hou&s;e
drops off from its weight, and leaves
a perpendicular wall of ice, of terrific
height. Between mountains, at little di&s;|tance
from each other, the glacier is a
narrow &s;treight; further on, it is an im|men&s;e
&s;ea, overlooked only by a few points,
half &s;wallowed up. In the upper regions,
the &s;ea is calm, and furrowed only by va&s;t
waves; if it e&s;capes along a narrow valley,
it is a furious torrent, where one wave fol|lows
ru&s;hing on another. Every thing
has the &s;emblance of motion and noi&s;e;
but all around is &s;tillne&s;s and peace.</P>
<P>I leave, without reluctance, particular
de&s;criptions of objects, and frigid details,
to writers who make a point of explaining
every thing; but I regret that I have not
been able to bring back from this new
world the power of painting to the ima|gination,
<PB N="334" REF="341">
as it was pictured before my
eyes; to retrace the &s;entiments with
which it in&s;pired me, and the ideas to
which it gave birth. Let no one judge
of its &s;olitudes by the &s;olitudes of our
plains. Here below, every thing lives,
&s;en&s;ation pervades the whole. In the
mo&s;t di&s;tant retreat, in de&s;erts where I do
not find the foot&s;teps of man, I find a fa|mily
of birds, which is the emblem of our
own; a r&egrave;public of in&s;ects, which recalls
the idea of our nations; their indu&s;try,
their relations and antipathies. The
waving of a tree, the &s;haking of a &s;hrub,
the rapid cour&s;e, or murmuring flow of a
rivulet, every thing brings me back to the
&s;entiment of exi&s;tence, by giving me the
idea of motion, the mo&s;t &s;oothing of all
ideas, becau&s;e it is the mo&s;t remote from
annihilation. But how different the im|men&s;e
de&s;erts of the Alps! One uniform
carpet covers their icy labyrinths, from the
<PB N="335" REF="342">
proude&s;t &s;ummits to the mo&s;t un&s;earch|able
aby&s;&s;es; it is the livery of the eternal
winters of the pole, a winding &s;heet which
enwraps the expiring earth.</P>
<P>An eternal &s;ilence reigns over this &s;e|cluded
region. If at remote di&s;tances an
avalanche falls amid&s;t its precipices; if a
rock rolls over its ice, the noi&s;e will be in|&s;ulated;
no living creature an&s;wers it by a
cry of terror, no timid birds fly away af|frighted;
the winding labyrinths of the&s;e
mountains, carpeted with &s;now, receive,
in &s;ilence, the &s;ound, which is repeated
by no echo. Who, but the ob&s;erver of
nature, would &s;u&s;pect that this va&s;t tomb
contains its &s;ecret laboratory, and that
like the careful monarch who, in the
tranquil retirement of his palace, dwells
with anxiety on the happine&s;s of his
people, the mother of the world pre|pares
in this abode, defended by &s;uch
<PB N="336" REF="343">
terrible avenues, the flowers with which
&s;he is to deck our plains.</P>
<P>The wa&s;te made by the icy ma&s;s, to
feed its lower branches, and the prodigi|ous
lo&s;s occa&s;ioned by evaporation, would
not be &s;ufficient to counterbalance the
continual increa&s;e which it receives, if
the upper &s;nows did not de&s;cend into the
region where they are to be di&s;&s;olved,
although with that &s;lowne&s;s which cha|racteri&s;es
their regular progre&s;s, and under
the &s;olid form which they acquire by this
gradual de&s;cent, &s;o that in a &s;hort &s;pace
the heights being overloaded with their
weight, and not having the faculty of
retaining them on their &s;teep declivities,
precipitate them, under the form of <HI>la|vanges,</HI>
into regions where the rays of the
&s;un have more active force.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="344">
Having by this means prematutely
reached the limit to which they all tend,
they are expo&s;ed, without &s;helter, to the
action of the heat, and melt with a cele|&s;ity
which &s;oon re-e&s;tabli&s;hes the balance
between the lo&s;s the increa&s;e. Dif|ferent
cau&s;es contribute to favour the re|moval
of the&s;e ma&s;&s;es of &s;now, and the
inhabitants of the country give different
names to this phaenomenon, according to
their cau&s;es, and to the forms which it re|ceives
from them. It is on this account
they are called lavanges of cold, lavanges
of heat, lavanges of wind, and lavanges of
du&s;t<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The word <HI>lavange</HI> is derived from the German term <HI>lavine,</HI> by which the inhabitants of the Swi&s;s Alps di&s;tingui&s;h this phaenomenon. That of <HI>Avalanche,</HI> which expre&s;&s;es the &s;ame thing, and which is more in u&s;e in the <HI>Roman&s;h</HI> country, has for its etymology the old word <HI>avaler,</HI> to de&s;cend, which is no longer un|der&s;tood in this &s;en&s;e; or rather from the adverb a-val, from the Monki&s;h Latin <HI>ad vallem,</HI> which is the origin of the word.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="345">
A ma&s;s of &s;now, which its own weight
alone detaches from the heights, on the
&s;lope of which it was &s;u&s;pended, is what
is called a lavange of cold, becau&s;e it is
generally in winter that the accumulation
of &s;now determines its de&s;cent. The fall
is always accompanied by a dreadful
cra&s;h, and nothing can re&s;i&s;t its cour&s;e.
Habitations, whole villages, are buried
under it; fore&s;ts are levelled with the
ground; rocks-bend before the &s;hock, and
are dragged on with the current. The air,
agitated by the precipitation of this enor|mous
ma&s;s, carries the deva&s;tation into
places which the &s;nows cannot reach; a
hurricane is le&s;s violent in its effects, and
&s;ometimes the traveller, who journeys out
of the reach of the lavange, has been
thrown down headlong, or &s;tifled by this
<PB N="339" REF="346">
impetuous bla&s;t, loaded with particles of
ice.</P>
<P>The lavange of <HI>heat</HI> or <HI>du&s;t</HI> differs but lit|tle
from the preceding. It has the &s;ame
origin, but is le&s;s compact; it falls le&s;s in
a ma&s;s, and by dividing it&s;elf, it covers a
greater extent of ground; the &s;now which
compo&s;es it, is an icy powder, extremely
fine and light. During the hot days of
&s;ummer, we frequently hear a noi&s;e like
that of thunder, or of a torrent which
throws it&s;elf from a con&s;iderable height
on a &s;urface of rock; it is one of the&s;e
di&s;tant lavanges, which falls from rock to
rock, under the form of a ca&s;cade of wa|ter
rai&s;ed into foam. A hot wind, which
blows from the &s;outhern region, and
which the inhabitants of the Swi&s;s Alps
call <HI>Foen,</HI> the &s;ame which from the fir&s;t
days of the month of March changes at
once the temperature of the air in the
<PB N="340" REF="347">
neighbouring countries, which in one day
enamels the meadows with violets, and
gives him who breathes it the fir&s;t feel|ings
of &s;pring; the Sirocco of the Italians
&s;weeps in a &s;hort time the &s;ummit of the
Alps. At that period lavanges follow one
another without intermi&s;sion, the torrents
ru&s;h from every glacier; and the rivers,
&s;uddenly &s;welled, overflow their banks.
When the wind ri&s;es, it finds a ma&s;s of
icy air above the Alps, which oppo&s;es its
pa&s;&s;age, and with which it &s;truggles, but
it is only at the end of two days that it
has power to take its place, and the in|habitants
of the northern plains of Swit|zerland
feel, for two days, a cold wind
which they know precedes the burning
wind they &s;hall feel on the third day<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This takes place in Suabia, and Al&s;ace, though in a much le&s;s &s;en&s;ible manner. No where el&s;e is felt this &s;udden change of &s;ea&s;on, which has &s;omething ma|gical in it, and which makes &s;o delicious an impre&s;&s;ion on every being; the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is &s;low and gradual, and the oppo&s;ite temperature coming into contact by &s;hades &s;carcely perceptible, give nature a monotonous progre&s;s, which affects the mind only with vague &s;en|&s;ations.</NOTE>.
<PB N="341" REF="348">
The lavange of <HI>wind</HI> is, of the number of
phaenomena of this kind, that which ap|pertains
mo&s;t to the high mountains of the
northerly parts of the globe. It is a &s;hift|ing
of &s;nows, occa&s;ioned, during the win|ter,
by violent hurricanes. The&s;e &s;nows,
which the cold has pre&s;erved in their &s;tate
of lightne&s;s, are carried away by the
winds, and tran&s;ported to a great di&s;|tance.</P>
<P>The a&s;pect of the region, where the&s;e
winds exerci&s;e their fury, is changed in an
in&s;tant; woe to tho&s;e who are then wan|dering
on their heights! the paths which
their foot&s;teps have traced, di&s;appear;
<PB N="342" REF="349">
the marks &s;et up at regular di&s;tance to
point out the direction of the roads are
thrown to the ground; and if the un|happy
traveller is not buried under this
furious &s;ea, he throws his eyes with de&s;pair
over an immen&s;e ocean, with nothing to
direct his &s;teps, and which offers no other
inequalities than the va&s;t waves, the moving
&s;urface of which has been ploughed by
the winds. It is thus that nature, in her
general views, overlooks partial evils. No
&s;acrifice is too great, when the pre&s;erva|tion
of her original plan is concerned; and
while &s;he is careful to conceal her un|changeablene&s;s
under an inexhau&s;tible va|riety
of forms, of what importance is it
that one of her &s;teps occa&s;ions the removal,
or annihilation of any of tho&s;e beings,
which &s;he &s;catters with &s;o much profu|&s;ion
over the &s;urface of the globe.</P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="350">
I &s;hall confine to this rapid outline, the
picture of the objects which my abode,
amid&s;t the Alps, has offered me.</P>
<P>Placed in the centre of the riche&s;t and
mo&s;t temperate part of the globe, the&s;e
mountains bring us in contact with the mo&s;t
&s;avage and mo&s;t frozen regions of the earth.
If we take a view of them relatively to their
con&s;tituent parts, we &s;hall find a re&s;pecta|ble
remnant of the fir&s;t &s;ketch of our
planet, an immoveable chain of &s;imple
rocks, which have kept their &s;eat amid&s;t
the revolutions of the earth, and which
have witne&s;&s;ed around them the birth and
decay of tho&s;e fortuitous and tumultuous
aggregations, tho&s;e &s;low ma&s;&s;es, the &s;econ|dary
mountains, children of the caprices
of nature, and fleeting as the&s;e caprices.
Within their bo&s;om they conceal virgin
fo&s;sils, as antient as them&s;elves, and
cry&s;tals, the faithful companions of gla|ciers.
<PB N="344" REF="351">
It is only at their feet that we &s;ee
tho&s;e calcarious, or argillaceous inve&s;t|ments,
the &s;trata of which contain wrecks
of beings, which live on the &s;urface of
the earth, or in the gulphs of the &s;ea;
tho&s;e &s;inuous hills, that wind around their
ba&s;is, which cover the primitive vallies
with a foreign &s;oil, the different &s;tates of
which bear evidence to the lap&s;es of ages,
from which the primordial mountains
have received little injury, and of which
they pre&s;erve &s;carcely any traces.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider the height of the&s;e
mountains, various other phaenomena pre|&s;ent
them&s;elves to our minds. The height
of thirty fathoms rai&s;es you a degree
above the equator; and the &s;ame varia|tions
of temperature which local circum|&s;tances,
&s;uch as the vicinity or the di&s;|tance
of &s;eas, the extent or ab&s;ence of fo|re&s;ts,
make in the temperature of climates,
<PB N="345" REF="352">
in a gradual progre&s;s towards the pole, are
$ound as you pa&s;s through the different
&s;ucce&s;sive &s;trata of the atmo&s;phere, repre|&s;ented
by the irregularities which are
cau&s;ed by the expo&s;ure of mountains,
with re&s;pect to the &s;un, the reflection of
neighbouring &s;urfaces, and the di&s;tance of
the ice, in the regular diminution of the
heat. In a greater elevation, &s;uch irre|gularities
dimini&s;h as tho&s;e local circum&s;tances
have le&s;s influence nearer the poles.
At twelve or thirteen hundred fathoms
height, you are at the eightieth degree
of latitude, and in a walk of a few hours
you have felt the influence of all the &s;ea|&s;ons;
&s;een the production of every cli|mate;
ran through the whole &s;cale of ve|getation,
and compared the birds of Italy
with tho&s;e of northern lakes and conti|nents<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">A naturali&s;t of Rome, Mr. Springlein, has formed, with con&s;iderable ta&s;te and expence, a complete col|lection of the birds of the Alps, which con&s;i&s;ts of about five hundred &s;pecimens.

<P><PB N="346" REF="353">
To &s;um up all, you have pa&s;&s;ed the
bounds of the mo&s;t frozen habitable zone.
At &s;eventy-five degrees you meet with
va&s;t fore&s;ts; but they are not to be found
in the Alps at the height of eleven hundred
fathoms. Here the cold is attended with
a &s;hortne&s;s of the column of air; there it
is maintained by the obliquity of the &s;un's
rays. It appears that vegetable life yields
foone&s;t to the impre&s;sion of the fir&s;t of
the&s;e circum&s;tances, and we &s;hould find
our&s;elves in the mo&s;t horrid of all regions,

Let no one imagine that exi&s;tance is

all their faculties. However wonderful
what I have advanced may appear, I &s;hall
not want evidences of its truth, and &s;hall

that he had left at the feet of the moun|tains,
his weakne&s;s, his infirmities, his

<P>In fine, who, in beholding from that &s;ta|tion

think without &s;ome feeling of contempt on
what we call great, or of pity on what we
<PB N="350" REF="357">

wonderful; every thing in the&s;e regions is
of collo&s;&s;al magnitude: the eye lo&s;t in
the immen&s;e chaos of mountains which it
&s;urveys, thinks it beholds an univer&s;e, and
this univer&s;e is but a point when it con|templates
the azure &s;pace in which we
wander. Nothing di&s;tracts or mi&s;leads
the mind employed on the&s;e &s;ublime ob|jects.
The &s;ilence of the&s;e de&s;erts, where
nothing breathes, or moves, beyond the
tumult of the habitable world; the view
of the&s;e profound aby&s;&s;es; of valleys
which tho&s;e immoveable cliffs have be|held
alternately de&s;ert and cultivated, peo|pled
to-day, to-morrow de&s;olated, the
a&s;ylum of &s;o many alternately happy and
mi&s;erable mortals, the theatre of &s;o many

our meditations more profound; to give
them that melancholy hue, that &s;ublime
<PB N="351" REF="358">
character which they acquire, when the
&s;oul, taking that $light which makes it con|temporary

time. In vain would rea&s;on &s;trive to count
by years. The &s;olidity of the&s;e enormous
ma&s;&s;es, oppo&s;ed to the accumulation of
their ruins, &s;tartles and con$ounds all its
calculations. Imagination &s;eizes the reins
which Rea&s;on drops, and in that long &s;uc|ce&s;sion
of periods, catches a glimp&s;e of the
image of eternity, which &s;he hails with
religious terror. How has every thing
vani&s;hed, which occupies, enchants, and
a&s;toni&s;hes us here below, when we com|pare
it with the objects of glory that are &s;et
before us! Thus, our mo&s;t extended ideas,
and our mo&s;t elevated and noble &s;enti|ments
have their origin in the wanderings

chimeras, for what would there be great
