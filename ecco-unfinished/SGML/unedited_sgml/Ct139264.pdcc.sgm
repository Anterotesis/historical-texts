<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY Man who is well acquaint|ed with the World, and has made ju&s;t Ob&s;ervations on Conver&s;ation in ge|neral, will, we apprehend, &s;ub&s;cribe to the Truth of Dean <HI>Swift</HI>'s A&s;&s;ertion, in the Motto affixed to our Title Page, namely, <HI>That</HI> PUNNING <HI>is a Talent which no Man affects to de&s;pi&s;e, but he that is without it:</HI> For notwith&s;tanding what the Dull and Mo|ro&s;e may advance to conceal their Ignorance or Ill-Nature, a &s;mart Pun, or &s;en&s;ible Con|ceit, adds much to the Life and Plea&s;ure of the Conver&s;ation of Per&s;ons of the mo&s;t ele|vated Sen&s;e, and contributes at the &s;ame time to the Improvement of the Mind, by exhibiting a new and happy A&s;&s;ociation of Ideas, or Compari&s;ons of different Objects and Ideas, which we &s;hould otherwi&s;e, per|haps, never have been acquainted with. And though Collections of this Kind meet with an affected Contempt from the Stupid and Pedantic, yet it may be boldly and truly affirmed, that they afford rational Amu&s;ement to Men of real Ta&s;te, Genius, and even pro|found Learning; being con&s;idered by the latter in the Light of an agreeable Relaxa|tion, after &s;everer Studies.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="4"><HI>Bons Mots</HI>, or witty Sayings, are &s;o far from being de&s;pi&s;ed by Men of Erudition, that numberle&s;s Sages and Philo&s;ophers, of every Age and Country, have conveyed In|&s;truction to Po&s;terity, in Sayings of Wit and Humour. The Truth of this A&s;&s;ertion every one of the lea&s;t Reading can te&s;tify.</P>
<P>Thus much we thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay, in behalf of Compilations of this Nature in general: As to this in particular, we flatter our|&s;elves, that the Reader will meet with much rational as well as innocent Amu&s;ement in it. As an Improvement to this Edition, many humorous Pieces are added, which were not in the former, nor even to be met with in any other Book of the Kind; and &s;everal Je&s;ts, in that which were thought too trite, are in this changed for others of greater Hu|mour and Novelty: So that, upon the whole, it is pre&s;umed this Collection has as much Merit as any ever introduced to the Publick; who&s;e Approbation the Editors &s;hall think them&s;elves happy in receiving, as they have not been wanting in their endeavours to de&s;erve it.</P>

<HEAD>MRS. PILKINGTON's JESTS.</HEAD>
<P>_MRS. PILKINGTON &s;peaking of the Oppre&s;&s;ion which <HI>Ireland</HI> laboured under from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Government, very &s;everely as well as &s;en&s;ibly ob|&s;erved, <HI>That it is wrong Policy in the Engli&s;h to permit the People of Ireland to have an Univer&s;ity. Learning naturally in&s;pires Men with the Love of Liberty; the Principles of which ought to be di&s;cou|raged in the Minds of tho&s;e whom their Ma&s;ters are plea&s;ed to condemn to Slavery, Want, and Oppre&s;|&s;ion; unle&s;s perhaps it may be done with a cruel In|tent of making their Yoke the more galling to them</HI>.</P>
<P>Dean <HI>Swift</HI> engaged Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI>'s Hu&s;|band, who was a Clergyman, to preach for him one <HI>Sunday</HI>, at St. <HI>Patrick</HI>'s Cathedral in <HI>Dublin</HI>, and at the &s;ame time gave him and his Wife an Invitation to dine with him. During the cour&s;e of that Day's Entertainment, Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI> ob|&s;erved and has related the following Peculiarities in the Behaviour of the Dean; and which are with Propriety introduced here, as in the cour&s;e of that Day's Conver&s;ation there were &s;everal Re|partees pa&s;&s;ed between the Dean and Mrs. <HI>Pil|kington</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="6">When Morning Service was over, Mrs. <HI>Pil|kington</HI> met the Dean at the Church-door, &s;ur|rounded by a Crowd of poor People, to all of whom he gave Charity, excepting one old Wo|man, who holding out a very dirty Hand to him, he told her gravely, <HI>That though &s;he was a Beg|gar, Water was not &s;o &s;carce but that &s;he might have wa&s;hed her Hands</HI>.</P>
<P>At Dinner he placed him&s;elf at the Head of the Table, oppo&s;ite to a large Pier-gla&s;s, under which was a Marble Side-board; &s;o that he could &s;ee in the Gla&s;s whatever the Servants did at it. The Beef being over-roa&s;ted, the Company were all put into Confu&s;ion; the Dean called for the Cook-maid, and ordered her to take it down &s;tairs, and do it le&s;s. The Maid an&s;wered very innocently, that &s;he could not. <HI>Why, what &s;ort of a Creature are you</HI>, &s;ays he, <HI>to commit a Fault that cannot be amended</HI>. And turning to Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI>, he &s;aid very gravely, <HI>That he hoped, as the Cook was a Woman of Genius, he &s;hould, by this manner of arguing, be able, in about a Year's time, to convince her, that &s;he had better &s;end up the Meat too little than too much done</HI>. Then ad|dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the Men Servants, he &s;aid, <HI>Whenever you imagine the Meat is ready, take it, Spit and all, and bring it up by force; and I will aid you if the Cook re&s;i&s;ts</HI>. The Dean turning his Eye on the Looking-gla&s;s, e&s;pied the Butler open|ing a Bottle of Ale, and helping him&s;elf to the fir&s;t Gla&s;s, and then filling up the Bottle with the Remains of another. <HI>Ha! Friend</HI>, &s;ays the Dean, <HI>&s;harp's the word, I find; you drank my Ale, for which I &s;top two Shillings of your Board-Wages this Week; for I &s;corn to be out-done in any thing, even in cheating</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="7">After Dinner, the Dean &s;aid to Mrs. <HI>Pilking|ton</HI>, Pray, Madam, do you &s;moke? To which &s;he replied, that neither &s;he or her Hu&s;band &s;mo|ked. <HI>That is a &s;ign</HI>, &s;aid he, <HI>you were neither of you bred in the Univer&s;ity of</HI> Oxford; <HI>for Drink|ing and Smoking are the fir&s;t Rudiments of Learn|ing taught there; and in tho&s;e two Arts no Univer|&s;ity in</HI> Europe <HI>can out-do them</HI>.</P>
<P>The Dean then de&s;ired Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI> to tell him her Faults. <HI>Sir</HI>, replied &s;he, <HI>I mu&s;t beg to be excu&s;ed; for if I can help it, you &s;hall never find them out</HI>. The Dean &s;aid Mr. <HI>Pilkington</HI> &s;hould tell him if &s;he would not.
<Q>&startq;I will, Sir, (&s;ays Mr. <HI>Pilkington</HI>) &endq;when I have di&s;covered them.</Q>
Dr. <HI>Delany</HI> being pre&s;ent, a&s;ked the Dean why he was &s;o unpolite as to &s;uppo&s;e Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI> had any Faults. <HI>Why, I will tell you</HI>, replied <HI>Swift; whenever I &s;ee a number of agreeable Qua|lities in any Per&s;on, I am always &s;ure they have bad ones &s;ufficient to poize the Scale</HI>. Mrs. <HI>Pil|kington</HI> bowed, and told the Dean, <HI>he did h$ great honour</HI>. In this &s;he &s;aid &s;he copied Bi&s;hop <HI>Berkley</HI>, whom &s;he had frequently heard declare, That when any Speech was made to him, which might be con&s;trued either into a Compliment or an Affront, or that had two Handles, he was &s;o meek and &s;o mild, that he always took hold of the be&s;t.</P>
<P>The Dean then a&s;ked Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI>, if &s;he was a Queen what &s;he &s;hould chu&s;e to have after Dinner. To which &s;he replied, <HI>Your Conver&s;a|tion</HI>. "Phooh! &s;ays he, I mean what Regale?" She cho&s;e Coffee.
<Q>&startq;Why then (returned the Dean) I will make you as happy as a Queen; you &s;hall have &s;ome in Perfection; for when I was Chaplain to the Earl of <HI>Berkley</HI>, who was
<PB N="4" REF="8">
in the Government here, I was &s;o poor that I was obliged to keep a Coffee-hou&s;e, and all &endq;the Nobility re&s;orted to it to talk Trea&s;on.</Q></P>
<P>At Supper, the Dean pulled out of his Pocket a Golden Cork-&s;crew, and opening a Bottle of Wine, he decanted it off: The la&s;t Gla&s;s being thick, he called to Mr. <HI>Pilkington</HI> to drink it, &s;aying at the &s;ame time, that he always kept &s;ome poor Par&s;on to drink his foul Wine for him. Mr. <HI>Pilkington</HI> entering into his Humour, thank|ed him, and told him he did not know the dif|ference, but was glad to get a Gla&s;s at any rate.
<Q>&startq;Why then (&s;ays the Dean) you &s;ha'n't, for I'll drink it my&s;elf. Why, Pox take you, you are wi&s;er than a paltry Curate, whom I a&s;ked to dine with me a few days ago; for upon my making the &s;ame Speech to him, he told me he did not under&s;tand &s;uch U&s;age, and &s;o walked off without his Dinner. By the &s;ame Token, I told the Gentleman who recommen|mended him to me, that the Fellow was a &endq;Blockhead, and I had done with him.</Q></P>
<P>The Dean then mi&s;&s;ing his golden Cork-&s;crew, told Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI> &s;he had &s;tolen it; &s;he affirm|ed &s;he had not. Upon looking for it, he found it where he had laid it; when he told Mrs. <HI>Pil|kington</HI> it was well for her he had found it, or he &s;hould have charged her with Theft. She a&s;ked why &s;he &s;hould be &s;u&s;pected more than any other in the Company? <HI>For a very good Rea&s;on</HI>, &s;ays he, <HI>becau&s;e you are the poore&s;t</HI>.</P>
<P>Another time Dean <HI>Swift</HI> had a Pre&s;ent made him, by the Author, of a Tran&s;lation of <HI>Horace</HI>'s <HI>Epi&s;tles</HI>, very curiou&s;ly bound. Soon after per|u&s;ing Part of it, he &s;aid to Mrs. <HI>Pilkington, This Book has a &s;pecial good Cover; but I have a mind
<PB N="5" REF="9">
there &s;hould be &s;omething valuable in the In&s;ide</HI>; &s;o taking out his Penknife, he cut out all the Leaves clo&s;e to the Margin, and ordered Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI> to pa&s;te &s;ome Letters of his Friend <HI>Pope, Boling|broke, &amp;c.</HI> which he gave her, into the Cover. <HI>And now</HI>, &s;ays he, <HI>as to the&s;e Leaves which I have cut out, I will give them what they greatly want</HI>; and immediately threw them all into the <HI>Fire</HI>.</P>
<P>The Dean invited Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI> to take a walk with him in his Garden, but as &s;he could not keep his Pace, he bade her &s;it down and re&s;t her&s;elf, while he kept walking on, by way of Exerci&s;e. Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI> relates, that &s;he could not help &s;miling at the Dean's odd Gaite; &s;he thought to her&s;elf, that he had written &s;o much in Prai&s;e of Hor&s;es in <HI>Gulliver's Travels</HI>, that he was re&s;olved to imitate them as nearly as he could. While &s;he was indulging this Fancy, the Dean returned to her, and by his Di&s;cour&s;e gave her a &s;trong Confirmation of his Partiality to tho&s;e Animals.
<Q>&startq;I have been con&s;idering, Madam, as I walked, (&s;aid he,) what a Fool Mr. <HI>Pil|kington</HI> was to marry you; for he could have afforded to keep a Hor&s;e for le&s;s Money than you co&s;t him; and that, you mu&s;t confe&s;s, would have given him better Exerci&s;e, and more Plea&s;ure than a Wife.&mdash;Why you laugh, &endq;and do not an&s;wer me &mdash; Is it not truth?</Q>
&mdash;
<Q>&startq;I mu&s;t an&s;wer you, Sir, (&s;aid &s;he,) with another Que&s;tion: Pray how can a Bachelor judge of &endq;this matter?</Q>
<Q>&startq;I find (&s;ays the Dean) you are vain enough to give your&s;elf the Prefer|&endq;ence.</Q>
I do, Sir, to that Species here: A
<Q>&startq;<HI>Hoyhnhum</HI> I would, as becomes me, give place &endq;to: But, Sir, it is going to rain.</Q>
<Q>&startq;I hope not, (&s;aid he,) for that will co&s;t me Six-pence
<PB N="6" REF="10">
&endq;for a Coach for you (the Garden being at a di&s;tance from the Hou&s;e;)</Q>
<Q>&startq;Come, make ha&s;te, &endq;O how the Te&s;ter trembles in my Pocket!</Q>
She obey'd, and they got to the Hou&s;e ju&s;t time enough to e&s;cape a heavy Shower.
<Q>&startq;Thank God (&s;ays the Dean,) I have &s;aved my Mo|ney: Here, you Fellow (to his Servant,) carry this Six-pence to the lame old Man that &s;ells Gingerbread at the Corner, becau&s;e he tries to &endq;do &s;omething, and does not beg.</Q></P>
<P>One day the Dean told Mr. <HI>Pilkington</HI> he would tell him his Wife's Faults before her Face; and accordingly began, in his jocular way, by accu&s;ing her with the In&s;olence of pretending to criticize the Works of the mo&s;t celebrated Ge|niu&s;es of the Age; and with affirming that &s;he thought her&s;elf preferable to a Hor&s;e, and more capable of giving her Hu&s;band Plea&s;ure; and other Matters of the like Nature. <HI>Well, Sir</HI>, &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Pilkington, all the&s;e Mi&s;demeanours may be included under the Article, Pride: Now let me know my other Crime. Why</HI>, replied the Dean, <HI>you can't walk fa&s;t. Well, Sir</HI>, return'd Mrs. <HI>Pilkington, if I can't mend my</HI> Pride, <HI>I'll try to mend my</HI> Pace. <HI>Mr. Pilkington</HI>, &s;aid the Dean, <HI>I have a mind to</HI> clip <HI>your Wife's Wit. Indeed, Sir</HI>, replied &s;he, <HI>that's Death by Law, for 'tis</HI> Sterling. <HI>Shut up your Mouth for all day, my Dear</HI>, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Pilkington, for that An&s;wer is real Wit. Nay</HI>, cries the Dean, <HI>I believe we had better &s;hut up our own, for at this rate &s;he'll be too many for us</HI>.</P>
<P>At a Time when Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI>'s Father was given over by the Phy&s;icians, who had cea&s;ed to pre&s;cribe for him, declaring that he could not outlive the Night; &s;he of her own Head gave
<PB N="7" REF="11">
him &s;ome Hock and Sack made warm, which threw him into a Sweat and deep Sleep, and, in &s;hort, recovered him, to the great Con&s;ternation of the Doctors; who, bantering her upon prac|ti&s;ing Phy&s;ic without having taken her Degrees, &s;he told them, &s;he held her Right to practi&s;e, <HI>extra Judice</HI>; and &s;miling continued, <HI>&s;he &s;uppo&s;ed they all under&s;tood Latin: But as their proper Bu&s;ine&s;s was to de&s;troy Life, &s;he hoped they would not take it ami&s;s, as the Ca&s;e &s;o nearly concerned her, that &s;he had fru&s;trated their De&s;ign: But</HI>, added &s;he, with a low Courte&s;ey, <HI>I humbly pre&s;ume to be|lieve, you</HI>
<Q><L>Had rather chu&s;e that he &s;hould die,</L>
<L>Than your Pre&s;criptions prove a Lie.</L></Q></P>
<P>Col. <HI>D&mdash;e</HI>, a plea&s;ant old Gentleman, once told Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI>, he wi&s;hed &s;he would take him into keeping; to which &s;he an&s;wered, that &s;he had really never &s;een any Per&s;on with whom &s;he was better entertained; and therefore, added &s;he, <HI>If you will make over all your real and per&s;onal E&s;tate to me, and di&s;po&s;e of your Regiment, and give me the Money, I will</HI> keep <HI>you</HI>.</P>
<P>The above-mentioned Colonel, who was very par&s;imonious, being pre&s;&s;ed by &s;ome Gentlemen to do an Act of Genero&s;ity, in&s;tead of comply|ing, evaded it with a Joke; which occa&s;ioned Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI> to ob&s;erve to a Nobleman pre|&s;ent, <HI>the Colonel has &s;o genteel and witty a Manner of excu&s;ing his Avarice, that &s;hould he ever grow generous, his Friends would lo&s;e a thou&s;and Plea|&s;antries</HI>.</P>
<P>She was employed by a certain Gentleman to write &s;ome Poetical Pieces, which he in&s;i&s;ted mu&s;t abound with Wit; they were accordingly exe|cuted to his Satisfaction, and he pa&s;&s;ed them
<PB N="8" REF="12">
upon the Public as his own; but &s;ome time after, a little Difference ari&s;ing between him and Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI>, he wrote her word, that &s;he was $ Fool. To which &s;he an&s;wered, <HI>I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t on it you were a much greater, to apply to a</HI> Fool <HI>for</HI> Wit.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Day Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI> opened her Pamphlet-&s;hop in <HI>St. James's-&s;treet</HI>, a Clergyman $ept in, and a&s;k'd her if &s;he had got any thing new? <HI>Yes, Sir</HI>, replied &s;he, <HI>my pre&s;ent Situation</HI>.</P>
<P>She paid the following genteel and witty Com|pliment to Lord <HI>King&s;borough: Invoke, my Lord, the &s;acred Nine; not one of the beauteous Virgins can be coy to &s;uch a Lover, re&s;embling &s;o much their own</HI> Apollo. <HI>I am very certain they have all be|&s;towed their</HI> Favours, <HI>tho' you are a Man of too much Honour to reveal it</HI>.</P>
<P>A certain Painter, who took pride in telling every body, that he was Sir <HI>Godfrey Kneller</HI>'s Ba&s;tard, was told by Mrs. <HI>Pilkington, That &s;ome People were &s;o fond of Family, that, to keep it up, they would prove them&s;elves</HI> Sons of Whores.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI> ridicules the Folly of rich and wicked Per&s;ons bequeathing their Wealth to the Poor after their Decea&s;e: <HI>As if</HI>, &s;ays &s;he, <HI>the Omnipotent could not &s;ee through the &s;hallow De|vice, or that his eternal Kingdom was to be pur|cha&s;ed with their</HI> Leavings.</P>
<P>A Gentleman telling Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI>, that a certain Apothecary of her Acquaintance was $oke, and obliged to &s;hut up Shop; &s;he en|quired the Cau&s;e; to which the Gentleman re|plied, he was &s;o hone&s;t a Man, that in&s;tead of loading his Patients with Medicines, as was too common a Practice, he advi&s;ed them to take the whol&s;ome Air, and of cour&s;e lo&s;t the Profit ari|&s;ing
<PB N="9" REF="13">
from the Sale of his Drugs. <HI>Poor Man</HI>, &s;ays &s;he, <HI>it is plain he could not live by the</HI> Air, <HI>tho' his Patients could</HI>.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI>, who was no great Friend to the Clergy, on account of the ill U&s;age &s;he had met with from &s;ome of the Cloth, frequently re|lated the following Story of the Count <HI>de St. Evremond</HI>.</P>
<P>When Count <HI>St. Evremond</HI>, who&s;e Writings are &s;o well known in the Literary World, was dangerou&s;ly ill, and had not enjoyed any Sleep for a long Time, a Con&s;ultation of Phy&s;icians was held, to think of &s;ome Means to procure him Re&s;t; which he being &s;en&s;ible of, called them to his Bed-&s;ide, and told them, he knew the Bu&s;i|ne&s;s they were upon, and believed he had him&s;elf thought of the mo&s;t effectual Remedy to procure &s;ound Sleep. They li&s;tened with Attention, to hear what he had to offer; when he de&s;ired them to &s;end for a certain Preacher, who was remark|able for Dulne&s;s, &s;aying, <HI>I don't remember that I ever heard that Gentleman preach, but I fell fa&s;t a&s;leep before his Sermon was half ended</HI>.</P>
<P>The following was written by Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI>, on the old and facetious Col. <HI>D&mdash;e</HI>'s boa&s;ting, in a jocular way, of having received certain Fa|vours from her, but that he made her no Pre&s;ent, becau&s;e he could not be convinced of the Since|rity of her Pa&s;&s;ion, if &s;he made any Demands on his Pocket.</P>

Her Cu&s;tom (&s;ays Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI>) was to live upon her Lodgers, even when &s;he knew they were mi&s;erably poor; in&s;omuch, that if one of them &s;ent but for a Pint of Small Beer, &s;he would intercept it in the Way, and drink half of it; <HI>but, indeed</HI>, (added Mrs. <HI>Pilkington) &s;he was very civil, for &s;he always &s;ent them Word &s;he drank their</HI> Healths; <HI>and &s;o &s;he did in reality, by depriving them of the Means of pre|&s;erving it</HI>.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI>, &s;peaking of the Trouble and Unea&s;ine&s;s which over-ceremonious Per&s;ons occa|&s;ion in Company, made the following Ob&s;erva|tion:
<PB N="24" REF="28">
<HI>What Re&s;pect &s;oever our Nobility may think is owing to the</HI> French <HI>Mode of cringing and com|plimenting, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I never &s;ee it practi&s;ed without a peculiar Pain, which I can compare to nothing but the Apprehen&s;ions I am under at the Sight of Tumblers, Rope-Dancers</HI>, &amp;c. <HI>&s;uch as, I believe, all rational Creatures &s;hare, at &s;eeing Men deform their Vi&s;ages by a Thou&s;and aukward Gri|maces, and their Bodies like joi$ed Babies, only be|cau&s;e it is a-la-M$l$ Fran$i&s;e: Neither do we &s;ee any but the mo&s;t illiterate $word$ practi&s;e it</HI>.</P>
<P>No Man had a greater Aver&s;ion to Exce&s;s of ridiculous Ceremony than Dean <HI>Swift</HI>; an In|&s;tance of which we &s;hall here re$a$e: A Lady of this Turn having given the Dean an Invitation to Dinner, and as &s;he had heard he was not ea&s;ily plea&s;ed, &s;he had taken a Month to provide for it. When the Time came, every Delicacy which could be purcha&s;ed the Lady had prepared, even to Profu&s;ion, (which <HI>Swift</HI> hated.) However, he was &s;carce &s;eated, when &s;he began to make a ceremonious Harangue; in which &s;he told him, That &s;he was &s;incerely &s;orry &s;he had not a more tolerable Dinner, &s;ince &s;he was apprehen&s;ive there was not there any Thing fit for him to eat; in &s;hort, that it was a bad Dinner. <HI>Pox take you</HI>, (&s;aid the Dean) <HI>why did you not get a better? Sure you had Time enough! But &s;ince you &s;ay it is &s;o bad, I'll e'en go Home and eat a Herring</HI>. Ac|cordingly he departed, and left her ju&s;tly confu&s;ed at her Folly, which had &s;poilt all the Pains and Expence &s;he had been at.</P>
<P>The following Story, on the Subject of true Politene&s;s, is not unapplicable to the foregoing:</P>
<P>A certain <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nobleman, who had the Ho|nour to be &s;ent Amba&s;&s;ador to <HI>France</HI>, was &s;aid
<PB N="25" REF="29">
to be one of the mo&s;t polite and be&s;t accompli&s;hed fine Gentlemen in <HI>Europe</HI>. This reached the Ears of the <HI>French</HI> King, who thought &s;uch a Character due to none but him&s;elf: But as every thing is proved by Trial, his Maje&s;ty took this Method of &s;atisfying his Curio&s;ity. One Morn|ing, when the Amba&s;&s;ador had a private Audi|ence, the King told him, he &s;hould be glad of his Excellency's Company to take an Airing with him; the Amba&s;&s;ador did not he&s;itate on accept|ing the Offer, but told his Maje&s;ty he was ready to wait on him; the King's Chariot was at the Door, which he very carele&s;sly de&s;ired the No|bleman to &s;tep into: <HI>No, Sir</HI>, replied the Am|ba&s;&s;ador, <HI>not before your Maje&s;ty</HI>; at which the King bur&s;t out a laughing, and &s;aid, <HI>No, no, my Lord, you are not the be&s;t bred Man in the World; otherwi&s;e you would have done what I de|&s;ired; &s;ince you might well know, that if it was not agreeable to me, I &s;hould not have paid you the Compliment</HI>.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the Peculiarities in Dr. <HI>Swift</HI>'s Behaviour on many Occa&s;ions, there is di&s;cover|able, even among tho&s;e Oddities, the Marks of a very prai&s;e-worthy Di&s;po&s;ition, as will appear by the following Relations.</P>
<P>The Dean &s;tanding one Winter's Day at the Deanry Window, &s;aw a very poor and ancient Woman &s;itting on the Steps, &s;hivering with Cold. His Footman happened to come to the Door; when the poor Creature be&s;ought him, in a pite|ous Tone, to deliver a Petition, which &s;he held in her Hand, to his Reverence. The Servant read it, and told her, with infinite Scorn, his Ma&s;ter had &s;omething el&s;e to mind than her Pe|tition. <HI>What's that you &s;ay, Fellow</HI>, &s;aid the
<PB N="26" REF="30">
Dean, looking out at the Window, <HI>come up here</HI>. The Man trembling obeyed him: He al&s;o de|&s;ired the poor Woman to come before him, made her &s;it down, and ordered her &s;ome Bread and Wine; after which he turned to the Man, and &s;aid, <HI>At what Time, Sir, did I order you to open a Paper directed to me? or to refu&s;e a Letter from any one? Hark ye, Sirrah, you have been admo|ni&s;hed by me for Drunkenne&s;s, Idling, and other Faults; but &s;ince I have di&s;covered your inhuman Di&s;po&s;ition, I mu&s;t di&s;mi&s;s you from my Service. So pull off my Cloaths, take your Wages, and let me hear no more from you</HI>.&mdash; The Fellow did &s;o, and having vainly &s;ollicited a written Di&s;|charge, (which is cu&s;tomarily given in <HI>Ireland</HI> to Servants, when di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from a Place,) was compelled to go to Sea, where he continued five Years; at the End of which Time, finding that Life far different from the Ea&s;e and Luxury of his former Occupation, he returned, and humbly confe&s;&s;ing, in a Petition to the Dean, his former Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and a&s;&s;uring him of his entire Reformation, which the Dangers he had under|gone at Sea had happily wrought, he begged the Dean would give him &s;ome Sort of a Di&s;charge. Accordingly the Doctor called for a Pen and Ink, and gave him the following Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, with which he &s;et out for <HI>London</HI>.</P>

<P><Q>&startq;Whereas the Bearer, &mdash; &s;erved me the Space of one Year, during which Time he was an Idler and a Drunkard, I then di&s;char|ged him as &s;uch; but how far his having been five Years at Sea may have mended his Man|ners, I leave to the Penetration of tho&s;e who &endq;may hereafter chu&s;e to employ him.</Q></P>

<P><PB N="27" REF="31">When the above Servant arrived in <HI>London</HI>, Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI> was there, to whom he applied to recommend him to a Place; and &s;he advi&s;ed him to go to Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>, who, on &s;eeing the Dean's Hand-writing, which he well knew, told the Man, if he could produce any credible Per|&s;on who would atte&s;t that he was the Servant the Dean meant, he would hire him. The Man applying to Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI>, &s;he gave him a Let|ter to Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>, a&s;&s;uring him, that &s;he knew the Man to have been Footman to the Dean; upon which Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> took him into his Service, wherein he continued to the Death of his Ma|&s;ter.</P>
<P>The following is another of the Dean's &s;en&s;i|ble Oddities. He one Day &s;ummoned a <HI>Senatus Con&s;ultum</HI>, as he called a few of tho&s;e very inti|mate Friends whom he peculiarly regarded; and placing them round a great Table, he told them they were an impanneled Jury, and &s;eated him&s;elf at the Head of it, as Judge. He then told them the Rea&s;on why they were &s;ummoned; which was, that his Friend Mr. <HI>Gratton</HI>'s favou|rite Hen was put to Death by an unlucky Stroke of a Whip, by one of his Fellows, as he &s;up|po&s;ed. I have accu&s;ed them, &s;ays he, and they deny the Fact; but as Murder will always come to Light, I found the Hen's Head and Neck in the Seat of my Chai&s;e-Box; and now I want to convict the Criminal. Accordingly he ordered his three Men Servants to come before the Com|pany, and related the following Story to them:&mdash; When Dr. <HI>Donne</HI>, afterwards Dean of <HI>St. Paul</HI>'s, took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fir&s;t Living he ever had, being a &s;peculative Man, he took a Walk into the Church-yard, where the Sexton was digging
<PB N="28" REF="32">
a Grave, and throwing up a Skull, the Doctor took it up to contemplate thereon, and found a &s;mall Sprig, or headle&s;s Nail, &s;ticking in the Temple, which he drew out &s;ecretly, and wrapt it up in the Corner of his Handkerchief: He then demanded of the Grave-digger, Whether he knew who&s;e Skull that was? He &s;aid he did very well; declaring it was a Man's who kept a Brandy-Shop, an hone&s;t drunken Fellow, who one Night taking too much of that comfortable Creature, was found dead in his Bed the next Morning. Had he a Wife? &s;aid the Doctor. Yes, Sir. Is &s;he living? Yes. What Charac|ter does &s;he bear? A very good one; only in|deed the Neighbours reflected on her, becau&s;e &s;he married the Day after her Hu&s;band was buried; though to be &s;ure &s;he had no great Rea&s;on to grieve after him. This was enough for the Doctor, who, under Pretence of vi&s;iting all his Pari&s;hioners, called on her; he a&s;ked her &s;everal Que&s;tions, and among others, what Sickne&s;s her fir&s;t Hu&s;band died of? She giving him the &s;ame Account he had before received, he &s;uddenly opened the Handkerchief, and cried, in an autho|ritative Voice, <HI>Woman, do you know this Nail?</HI> She was &s;truck with Horror at the unexpected Demand, and in&s;tantly owned the Fact. <HI>And &s;o, Fellow</HI>, &s;aid the Dean, <HI>do you know this Head?</HI> The Criminal confe&s;&s;ed his Fault, and the Jury brought him in <HI>Guilty of Hen-&s;laughter in his own Defence</HI>, for he declared he was hun|gry, and did eat it, having no Malice perpen&s;e to it, but rather Love. On account of his Sin|cerity, and the Company's Interce&s;&s;ion, the Dean pardoned him.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="33">Dean <HI>Swift</HI> has been frequently called the <HI>Engli&s;h Rabelais</HI>; but with Submi&s;&s;ion to the <HI>French</HI>, and their Admirers, we apprehend they pay <HI>Swift</HI> but an indifferent Compliment by the Compari&s;on; as <HI>Rabelais</HI> was rather a Buffoon than a Man of Sterling Wit, &s;ound Judgment, exten&s;ive Knowlege, and deep Learning, as the Dean mo&s;t certainly was; nor were any of the Oddities of the latter marked with Buffoonry and Indelicacy, as mo&s;t of tho&s;e of the former were, as appears by the two following In&s;tances, which we have tran&s;lated and in&s;erted here, for the &s;ake of giving the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Reader an Idea of the fa|vourite <HI>French</HI> Wit.</P>
<P><HI>Rabelais</HI> one Day walking in the Streets of <HI>Paris</HI>, had pre&s;&s;ing Occa&s;ion to go to a Nece&s;&s;ary-Hou&s;e; but not knowing any Body in the Street where he was taken, a Thought came &s;ud|denly into his Head, in order to relieve his pre|&s;ent Nece&s;&s;ity, and at the &s;ame Time to afford him&s;elf Matter of Merriment: He went into an Uphol&s;terer's Shop, ju&s;t at Hand, and a&s;ked him whether he &s;old Clo&s;e-Stools? The Man an&s;wered, Yes, and immediately &s;hewed him one. <HI>Have you none hand&s;omer than this?</HI> &s;ays <HI>Rabelais; &s;hew me &s;ome covered genteelly with dif|ferent coloured Velvets</HI>. While the Shopkeeper went backwards to fetch them, <HI>Rabelais</HI> let down his Breeches, and made u&s;e of that which was fir&s;t brought to him. The Uphol&s;terer returning with the others, and &s;eeing him in &s;uch a Po&s;ture, called out, <HI>Sir, Sir, What are you about? Only trying it</HI>, an&s;wered <HI>Rabelais:</HI> Then putting up his Breeches, he walked away, &s;aying, <HI>They will not do for me; they are all too low</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="34">Another Time, upon a like Occa&s;ion, the &s;aid Je&s;ter went under a Gate-way, it being at Night, and eas'd him&s;elf in his Servant's Hat, and ordered the Fellow to walk before him with it under his Arm: The Ma&s;ter following at a little Di&s;tance, was re&s;olved to treat him&s;elf with a Laugh, at the Expence of a Baker, who&s;e Shop he was ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ing by. He went to the Baker, and told him (pointing to his Lacquey,) <HI>That Fellow has &s;tole a Loaf off your Bulk, and conceals it in his Hat, under his Arm</HI>. Away ran the poor Baker after the Servant, and &s;eizing the Hat, ha&s;tily thru&s;t his Hand in, think|ing to &s;ecure his Loaf; but his Sen&s;es of Feel|ing and Smelling &s;oon convinced him of his Di&s;|appointment, to the great Mortification of the Baker, and to the no &s;mall Entertainment of <HI>Rabelais</HI>.</P>

<P>Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI> u&s;ed to relate the following Matters of Merriment.</P>
<P>A <HI>Frenchman</HI>, who &s;poke very broken <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>, having &s;ome Words with his Wife, endeavoured to call her <HI>Bitch</HI>, but could not recollect the Name; at la&s;t he thought he had done it, by &s;aying, <HI>Begar, mine Deare, but you be one damn'd Dog's Wife</HI>. Aye, that's true enough, an&s;wer|ed the Woman, the more's my Misfortune.</P>
<P>A Man telling his Friend the Situation of his Affairs, with Regard to his Creditors, who were &s;omewhat pre&s;&s;ing on him, &s;aid that his Debts were mo&s;tly in Fives and Sixes, (meaning &s;o many Pounds.) <HI>Well</HI> (an&s;wers his good-natured Friend,) <HI>&s;ince your Affairs are not at</HI> Sixes and Sevens <HI>yet, cheer up, I'll &s;tand your Friend</HI>.</P>
<P>A Gentleman, who was very moro&s;e and ill-natured at home in his Family, was remarkably facetious and merry abroad, in&s;omuch that he was more than ordinarily entertaining where|ever he went; which occa&s;ioned a Lady once, at a merry Meeting where he was, to &s;ay to one pre&s;ent, who knew him well; <HI>Surely, if that Gentleman is married, his Wife mu&s;t be extremely happy; for he is quite</HI> the Fiddle of the Com|pany.

<HI>Very true, Madam</HI>, (&s;ays the Per&s;on &s;he &s;poke to,) <HI>but he always hangs his Fiddle up at the Door when he goes home</HI>.</P>
<P>A Lady of Quality's Woman, who was mighty ignorant, and very much affected the U&s;e of hard Words and odd Simile's, having been &s;lighted by the <HI>Valet-de-Chambre</HI>, who had once made Love to her, &s;he encouraged the Addre&s;&s;es of the Butler, who offered him&s;elf as her Humble Servant; the Valet, notwith&s;tanding he had been very cool towards her before, could not bear to &s;ee a Rival, (a common Thing in Matters of Love) began to be &s;weet upon her again; but Madam pu&s;hed him away, with a &s;econd-hand genteel Scorn, &s;aying at the &s;ame Time, with an affected Air, <HI>Pray forbear your</HI> Redre&s;&s;es <HI>to me, Fellow; it is true, I lov'd you once as if Hea|ven and Earth were coming together; but now I value you no more than an Apple's like an Oy&s;ter</HI>.</P>
<P>A Clergyman of a facetious Turn of Mind, who lived in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI>, a Coa&s;t on which Ship|wrecks have frequently happened; and where, upon &s;uch Occa&s;ions, the Inhabitants, in&s;tead of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Unfortunate in their Di&s;tre&s;s, u&s;ed to plunder all they could lay Hands on, and treat the People ill; and were &s;o keen at the News of a Wreck, that they would leave all Manner of Bu&s;ine&s;s to plunder. A Misfortune of this Kind happening one <HI>Sunday</HI>, during the Time of Di|vine Service, the Alarm was given, <HI>A Wreck! A Wreck!</HI> upon which they began to &s;camper out with great Precipitation; which our Par&s;on perceiving, opened the Pulpit Door, and walk|ing down the Stairs, called out at the &s;ame Time, with a loud Voice, <HI>Brethren, let me intreat you to hear five Words more</HI>. They turned about

<P>A Man paying a Vi&s;it to &s;ome Friends in the North of <HI>Ireland</HI>, they made him very welcome, but cau&s;ed him to drink &s;o exceeding hard, that he wi&s;hed him&s;elf at home again, &s;aying, <HI>he was &s;ure that if he lived there</HI> long, <HI>he &s;hould die</HI> &s;oon.</P>
<P>On a Benefit Night at the Playhou&s;e, many particular Friends of the Actor were let$in at a private Door, before the great Doors were open; which when di&s;covered, a Gentleman cried out, in a Pa&s;&s;ion, <HI>It is a Shame they &s;hould fill the Hou&s;e full of People before any Body came</HI>.</P>
<P>An Apothecary at <HI>S&mdash;y</HI>, who took great Plea&s;ure in humbugging the Country Fellows, or, in &s;hort, any body el&s;e that was fit for his Purpo&s;e, pa&s;&s;ing through the Market-Place, &s;aw a Fellow &s;tanding idle, and gaping about him. <HI>Hone&s;t Man</HI>, (&s;ays he,) <HI>you &s;eem to have nothing to do; and if that is the Ca&s;e, I can give you a little Employment, which you may do at your Lei|&s;ure</HI>. The Fellow &s;cratching his Head, made his Scrape, and thanked him for the Favour in|tended. The Apothecary then proceeded to tell him, that in his Way of Practice he had Occa|&s;ion to u&s;e large Black Rats, and it was a hard Matter to procure them in Town; therefore if he (the Countryman) would make it his Bu&s;ine&s;s to hunt for them in the Barns, Malthou&s;es, &amp;c. in the Country, he would give him Half a Crown a-piece for as many as he could get. The Fel|low,
<PB N="39" REF="43">
quite overjoyed at the News of &s;o profit|able an Employment, was in Ha&s;te to be gone, and, after taking the Apothecary's Direction, marched off with great Expedition. The Apo|thecary, on his Part, was full as well plea&s;ed at the Fellow's &s;wallowing the Hum &s;o greedily; and immediately went to communicate the Laugh to his Friends. In &s;hort, in about a Fortnight af|ter, the poor Countryman came to the Apothe|cary's Hou&s;e, laden with a Sack full of Rats, and addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to him, told him he had at length got together as large a Quantity of Rats as he could, and that they were alive, and in good Condition. The Apothecary, who had practi&s;ed many little Matters of Merriment of the &s;ame Kind, &s;ince he had &s;et this Affair on Foot, had quite forgot it; however, being al|ways ready to carry on a Joke, he told the Fel|low, that he had delayed procuring them &s;o long, that he had been obliged to furni&s;h him&s;elf el&s;e|where, and that at pre&s;ent he him&s;elf had no Occa&s;ion for them, but recommended him to one of the &s;ame Profe&s;&s;ion in Town, who, he pretended would be glad to buy them. Away trudges the Countryman, but to no Purpo&s;e, for the Per&s;on he was directed to made the &s;ame Ex|cu&s;e, and &s;ent him to another; and as they were all in the Secret, the poor Fellow was bandied about from one to another almo&s;t the whole Day, lugging the wicked Load from Place to Place. At length the Fellow, perceiving that he was only made a Fool of, returned to the Apo|thecary who employed him to catch the Rats, and told him, that all the Gentlemen he had been with, were provided; and that rather than lo&s;e his Labour, he would &s;ell them for a Shilling
<PB N="40" REF="44">
a-piece. The Apothecary an&s;wered, that for his Part he had enough already: The Man then told him, he &s;hould have them for Six-pence each; but the other &s;till urged that he was &s;up|plied. <HI>Well</HI>, (&s;ays the Fellow,) <HI>&s;ince you will not buy them, &s;ooner than carry them any farther, I will make you a Pre&s;ent of them</HI>; &s;o opening the Sack, he let out all the Rats in the Shop: The Creatures, loo&s;ed from Confinement, in a &s;trange Place, flew and tore about the Shop and Parlour at a wicked Rate, de&s;troying Bottles, Gla&s;&s;es, Gallipots, China, &amp;c. to the great Mortification of the Apothecary, and to the high Satisfaction of the Country Fellow. In &s;hort, the former has not, &s;ince that Time, been &s;o keen at hum|bugging as u&s;ual; and the latter pre&s;ently <HI>&s;mells a Rat</HI>, when People endeavour to impo&s;e upon him.</P>
<P>A Gentleman having made an Entertainment for &s;ome Friends, one of the Servants carrying a Neat's Tongue up Stairs to the Dining-Room, he &s;tumbled, and the Tongue &s;lipt out of the Di&s;h; the Ma&s;ter hearing the Clatter, went to the Stair-head to know the Cau&s;e, which being informed of, was &s;omewhat angry; but the Fel|low begg'd Pardon, and &s;aid, he hoped he &s;hould be excu&s;ed, as it was only a <HI>Lap&s;us Linguae</HI>, (a Slip of the Tongue;) which facetious Turn &s;o plea&s;ed the Gentleman and his Company, that his Wit was rewarded by the Gift of a Shilling a-piece from all pre&s;ent. Another waiting at Table at the &s;ame Time, and &s;eeing the Re|ward conferred on his Fellow-Servant, remem|bering the Words, was determined to try his Luck, and accordingly being &s;ent up with a Sir-Loin of Beef, he &s;tumbled on Purpo&s;e, and the
<PB N="41" REF="45">
Joint fell out of the Di&s;h; which greatly pro|voked the Gentleman; when the ignorant Block-head &s;aid it was only a <HI>Lap&s;us Linguae</HI>; for which he got a hearty Drubbing, and was kick'd down Stairs.</P>
<P>Two Citizens di&s;puting which of them was the be&s;t Scholar, one told the other he would lay him a Wager, he did not know what was <HI>Latin</HI> for a Goo&s;e. <HI>Perhaps not</HI>, (an&s;wered the other,) <HI>but if my Son was here, he would give you an im|mediate</HI> An&s;er, (which is <HI>Latin</HI> for a Goo&s;e.)</P>
<P>A Gentleman &s;eeing another, &s;itting in a Ne|ce&s;&s;ary-Hou&s;e, with a Book in his Hand reading very attentively, &s;aid, he was &s;orry his Memory was &s;o bad, that he could not <HI>&s;h&mdash;te without Book</HI>.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>C&mdash;d</HI>, a Nobleman of too much Fortitude and Greatne&s;s of Soul to be &s;haken with every Breath, was in <HI>Ireland</HI> during the late Rebellion in <HI>Scotland</HI>, and one Morning, when it was reported that the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks were about to ri&s;e, a Gentleman ran into his Chamber very abruptly, <HI>My Lord, my Lord, we're undone</HI>, &s;ays he, <HI>all</HI> Ireland <HI>are expected to be up immediately. Why, what's o'Clock?</HI> &s;ays the Nobleman. <HI>Ten, my Lord</HI>, an&s;wered the Gen|tleman. <HI>Well then, truly</HI>, &s;ays his Lord&s;hip, very calmly, <HI>I'll get up my&s;elf, for I think every Man &s;hould be up at ten o'Clock</HI>.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Nobleman being informed by &s;ome officious Per&s;on, that his Coachman went to Ma&s;s, he an&s;wered, with a Smile, <HI>Does he &s;o, well I promi&s;e you he &s;hall never drive me there</HI>.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>IMPARTIAL DECISION,</HI> or <HI>LEX Talionis</HI>.</HEAD>
<P>A YOUNG Fellow, walking through the Streets of <HI>Paris</HI>, chanced to e&s;py a Pur&s;e with Money in it lying near a Church Door, which he joyfully pocketed; and &s;oon after meeting with &s;ome Friends he acquainted them with his good Fortune, and invited them to take a Gla&s;s with him on the chearful Occa&s;ion, at an adjacent
<PB N="45" REF="49">
Tavern, which they readily accepted. In the mean time the Man who had lo&s;t the Pur&s;e, making careful and diligent Enquiry, got In|telligence of the Manner of its being found, and where the Per&s;on was who found it.</P>
<P>Away flies the Owner of the Pur&s;e to a proper Officer, who attended him to the Place where the&s;e merry Blades were regaling over a Bottle; and demanded if any one there had found a Pur&s;e.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or had not A&s;&s;urance enough to deny the Fact, but readily pulls it out, and tendered it to the Owner, begs the Favour of him to tell his Money over, and a&s;&s;ures him, that there was but one Crown melted, which was metamorpho&s;ed into Claret, for the Entertain|ment of him&s;elf and Friends.</P>
<P>The Gentleman in&s;i&s;ted on Re&s;titution to a Farthing. The Delinquent not having any Money in his Pocket, to an&s;wer the Demand, the whole Hou&s;e was in an Uproar.</P>
<P>The Con&s;table attempted to &s;ecure him, but the young Fellow being &s;trong and active, got from him, ran out of the Hou&s;e, and the Con|&s;table, &amp;c. after him. Cro&s;&s;ing the Street in his ha&s;ty Flight, he unluckily ran again&s;t a Trade&s;man's Wife, who was big with Child, which threw her down, and greatly frightened her.</P>
<P>He &s;till continued his Flight, and &s;eeing a Ladder, which &s;tood again&s;t a Hou&s;e then re|pairing, he ran up it, but the Con&s;table &s;haking it below when the other was near the Top, he tumbled down upon him, and broke the Con|&s;table's Arm.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="50">Being now &s;ecured, he was carried before a Magi&s;trate, where all the Sufferers appeared in a Body again&s;t him. He that lo&s;t his Pur&s;e, the Hu&s;band of the big-bellied Woman, and the Con&s;table with his broken Arm. All loudly in|veterate again&s;t the young Fellow, in hopes of getting them&s;elves rewarded, and him pu|ni&s;hed.</P>
<P>The Ju&s;tice well weighing the Allegations, thought the Man not very culpable, but that the Di&s;a&s;ters which had happened were rather the Effects of mere Accident than a bad Di&s;po&s;ition, he thus &s;ettled the Affair:</P>
<P>That &s;ince the Pri&s;oner had embezzled Part of the Pro&s;ecutor's Money, and that the latter had refu&s;ed the Remainder, he (the Pri&s;oner) &s;hould keep what he had, 'till he was able and willing to re&s;tore the whole. Then turning to the Hu&s;band of the Woman with Child, he told him that if his Wife was dangerou&s;ly hurt, the Pri&s;oner &s;hould pay the Phy&s;ician, and if &s;he &s;hould mi&s;carry, he &s;hould be obliged to cohabit with her, till &s;he was was as far gone with Child, as &s;he was before her Mi&s;carriage; and as to Mr. Con&s;table, who&s;e Heart was ready to bur&s;t with Anger and Avarice, the Ju&s;tice told him, that according to the Law of <HI>Lex Talionis</HI>, he might, if he plea&s;ed, a&s;cend the Ladder, and tumble down upon the Pri&s;oner and break his Arm in the &s;ame Manner. This impartial De|ci&s;ion plea&s;ed all the Hearers except the Com|plainants, who were horridly chagrined at being di&s;appointed of the Fines they expected would be levied on the young Fellow.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>SWEARER RECLAIMED;</HI> or a plea&s;ant Way of working the Reforma|tion of a Sinner. From the <HI>French</HI>.</HEAD>
<P>THREE merry Companions being met toge|ther to &s;pend an Evening; after Supper, they &s;at down to play at Hazard. One of them had ac|quired a Habit of Swearing to &s;uch a Degree, that he could hardly forbear it in common Con|ver&s;ation, but if any Way provoked, would &s;wear immoderately. It fell out that Luck run again&s;t him, and at every Throw he lo&s;t; he cur&s;ed and bla&s;phemed in &s;uch a &s;hocking Manner, that his Companions were frightened to hear him, and the more they reprehended him, the more he &s;wore. At length, having lo&s;t all his Money, he drew towards the Fire, and &s;oon after fell fa&s;t a&s;leep. The other two, who &s;till continued their Play, hear|ing him &s;nore, they contrived an innocent De|vice to reclaim him, if po&s;&s;ible, from &s;wearing for the future. They put out the Candles, and extingui&s;hed the Fire, &s;o that there was not a Spark of Light to be &s;een; and then pretended to di&s;pute about a Throw which they feigned to be doubtful. They made &s;uch a Noi&s;e in their &s;ham Quarrel, that their Companion &s;tarted from his Sleep, rubbing his Eyes and &s;eeing no Light, a&s;k|ed how they could play without a Candle. Poh, Poh, &s;aid they, you are not awake yet, and pre|tended to play on without regarding him. Ju&s;t as he was do&s;ing a &s;econd Time, they feigned another Di&s;pute on the Ca&s;t of a Dye, and wak|ed him to decide it. He opened his Eyes, but &s;till &s;eeing no Light, he &s;aid, How would you
<PB N="48" REF="52">
have me judge when there is no Candle to &s;ee by; P&s;haw, &s;aid they, rub your Eyes: Which he did &s;everal Times, and wi&s;hed the Devil might fetch him if he could &s;ee the lea&s;t Glimmering. They counterfeited great A&s;toni&s;hment, and a&s;ked him &s;eriou&s;ly if he was not making Game. He an|&s;wered, Let me die if I am. Reach the Candle, &s;ays one of the Humbuggers to the other, which he held before the Fellow's Eyes, unlighted, and a&s;ked him if he &s;aw the Candle; he prote&s;ted he did not; they &s;eemed wonderfully &s;urprized, and a&s;&s;ured him his Eyes to all Appearance looked clear and well. The Man now began to be ter|rified; which his Companions perceiving, were re&s;olved to improve: Ah, &s;ays one of them, It is to be feared, that the horrid Bla&s;phemies you have uttered again&s;t Heaven, has brought down this Judgment of Blindne&s;s upon you. The Fellow cried and roared bitterly, and prayed Forgivene&s;s of his Sins, which his Companions earne&s;tly re|commended to him, and leading him to a Bed in the Room, took their Leave. He &s;ighed, groan|ed, vowed, and prayed the greater Part of the Night; made very &s;olemn Promi&s;es of abandon|ing his Sins; and at la&s;t fell a&s;leep. When he awaked in the Morning, ju&s;t about Peep of Day, he thought his Sight was returning by Degrees, in Con&s;equence of his Prayers and Vows; this Opi|nion his Friends agreed with him in, &s;o that he really thought a Miracle had been wrought on him. In &s;hort, he entirely left off &s;wearing, and led a good and virtuous Life.</P>

Thy Mother dy'd in bearing Thee, ju&s;t in her Prime and Vigour, when &s;he had &s;carce reach'd four hun|dred Years; of one hundred and &s;ixty Children which &s;he left me, but ninety now remain; the re&s;t are all as if they had never been. Re|member this; and in Youth be mindful of thy Duty to that invi&s;ible and uncreated Being, who, after this tran&s;itory Exi&s;tence, can make thee live for evermore. Let not the Flatteries of Men &s;well thee up with Vanity and Pride, nor believe them when they call thy Charms immortal. They tell thee what is not; a little while will a&s;&s;uredly prove them Liars; for Nothing more certainly takes its Flight than Beauty. Many whom now th&oacute;u &s;ee&s;t decay'd and withered, not above two or three hundred Years ago, were as thou art now, admired and courted. Learn then from them what thou &s;halt be; and &s;ince Beauty will not continue, improve thy

<HEAD>The Di&s;mal Effects of <HI>FORCED MARRIAGES</HI>. A melancholy <HI>TALE</HI>.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The following remarkable Story has its Foundation in Fact, and is &s;till pre&s;erved in a curious Painting in <HI>Coucy-Ca&s;tle</HI> in <HI>France;</HI> (not|with&s;tanding &s;uch a long Succe&s;&s;ion of Years,) quite fre&s;h to this Day.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>ABOVE a hundred Years ago, there dwelt in <HI>France</HI> one Captain <HI>Coucy</HI>, a gallant Gentle|man, of ancient and noble Extraction, and Keeper of <HI>Coucy</HI> Ca&s;tle, which is yet &s;tanding, and in good Repair. He fell in Love with a young Lady, and paid her honourable Court&s;hip: There was a reciprocal Affection between them; but her Parents having a more advantageous Match in View, forcibly married her to one Mon&s;ieur <HI>Fayel</HI>, who was a Man of immen&s;e Fortune, but no way agreeable to the young Lady. Capt. <HI>Coucy</HI>, upon this di&s;agreeable E|vent, immediately quitted <HI>France</HI>; and the Lady, who was now Mademoi&s;elle <HI>Fayel</HI>, laboured un|der continual Di&s;content of Mind. Capt. <HI>Coucy</HI> went to the Wars in <HI>Hungary</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Turks</HI>, and in the Battle near <HI>Buda</HI> received a mortal Wound. Being carried to his Quarters, he lan|gui&s;hed a few Days, and then expired: But a little before his Death, he called an old, tru&s;ty Servant to the Bed-&s;ide, and told him that he had had many Proofs of his Fidelity and Truth, but now he had a great Concern to entru&s;t him with, which he conjured him by all Means to execute; which was, that after his Death he &s;hould get his

Body opened, and then take his Heart out, and put it in an earthen Pot to be baked to Powder; then to put the Powder into a hand&s;ome Box, with a Bracelet of Hair that he had long worn about his Wri&s;t (which was a Lock of Made|moi&s;elle <HI>Fayel</HI>'s,) together with a Note he had written with his own Blood to her; and after he had given him the Rites of Burial, to make all the Speed he could to <HI>France</HI>, and deliver the &s;aid Box to Mademoi&s;elle <HI>Fayel</HI>. The faithful Servant did as his departed Ma&s;ter had com|manded, and &s;o went to <HI>France</HI>; and going into Mon&s;. <HI>Fayel</HI>'s Hou&s;e, he was &s;een by that Gen|tleman, who knowing him to be Captain <HI>Coucy</HI>'s Servant, examined what his Bu&s;ine&s;s was; and finding him equivocate, and faulter in his Speech, ordered him to be &s;earched; and the little Box, with the Powder, Bracelet, and Note, were found upon him. The Bearer was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with Me|naces, and charged not to come near the Hou&s;e for the future.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. <HI>Fayel</HI> immediately &s;ent for his Cook, and delivered him the Powder, charging him to make a little well-reli&s;hed Di&s;h of it, without lo&s;ing a Jot of it, for it was a very co&s;tly thing; and commanded him to bring it in him&s;elf, after the la&s;t Cour&s;e at Supper. The Cook brought in the Di&s;h accordingly, and Mon&s;. <HI>Fayel</HI> ordered all but his Wife to leave the Room, and began a &s;erious Di&s;cour&s;e with her; telling her, that he had ob&s;erved that &s;he had a continual Melan|choly rooted in her Heart; that he &s;aw &s;he had been con&s;tantly pining ever &s;ince her Marriage; and that he plainly perceived &s;he was entering into a Con&s;umption; therefore he had provided a very precious Cordial, which he was well a&s;|&s;ured
<PB N="54" REF="58">
would cure her. At his Entreaty &s;he took the little Preparation, and eat it; and afterwards &s;he much importuning him to know what it was, he told her &s;he had eaten <HI>Coucy</HI>'s Heart, and &s;o drew the Box out of his Pocket, and &s;hewed her the Letter and the Bracelet. In a &s;udden Exul|tation of gloomy Joy, &s;he cried out, <HI>This is a precious Cordial, indeed!</HI> and eagerly lick'd the Di&s;h; &s;aying, <HI>It is &s;o precious, that 'tis pity that any Meat &s;hould ever be put upon it</HI>.

<P>DON <HI>Alonzo</HI>, a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Nobleman, had a beautiful and virtuous Wife, with whom he had lived for &s;ome Years in great Tranquillity. The Gentleman, however, was not freed from the Faults u&s;ually imputed to that Nation; he was proud, jealous, and impetuous. He kept a <HI>Moor</HI> in his Hou&s;e, whom, on a Complaint from his Lady, he had puni&s;hed, for a &s;mall Offence, with the utmo&s;t Severity. The Slave vowed Re|venge, and communicated his Re&s;olution to one of the Lady's Women, with whom he lived in a criminal Way. This Creature al&s;o hated her Mi&s;tre&s;s, for &s;he feared &s;he was ob&s;erved by her; &s;he therefore undertook to make Don <HI>Alon&s;o</HI> jea|lous, by in&s;inuating that the Gardener was often admitted to his Lady in private, and promi&s;ing to make him an Eye-Witne&s;s of it.

<P>Here he pau&s;ed, looking on the dead Bodies with all the Agitations of a Daemon of Re|venge; when the Wench who had occa&s;ioned the&s;e Terrors, di&s;tracted with Remor&s;e, threw her&s;elf at his Feet, and in a Voice of Lamenta|tion, without Sen&s;e of the Con&s;equence, repea|ted all her Guilt. <HI>Alon&s;o</HI> was overwhelmed with all the violent Pa&s;&s;ions at one In&s;tant, and utter|ing the broken Voices and Motions of each of them, for a Moment, till at la&s;t he recollected him&s;elf enough to end his Agony of Love, An|ger, Di&s;dain, Revenge, and Remor&s;e, by mur|dering the Maid, the <HI>Moor</HI>, and him&s;elf.</P>

<P>LET it be recorded (&s;ays the ingenious Wri|ter of the Dean's Life,) to the Honour of Dr. <HI>Swift</HI>, and to animate others by his Example and Reward, that during his Connection with tho&s;e who were in the highe&s;t Rank, and who in every Rank would have been great, he would never &s;uffer him&s;elf to be treated but as an Equal, and repul&s;ed every Attempt to hold him in Depen|dance, or keep him at a Di&s;tance, with the ut|mo&s;t Re&s;entment and Indignation.</P>
<P>It happened upon &s;ome Occa&s;ion, that <HI>Harley</HI> &s;ent him a Bank Bill of Fifty Pounds by his pri|vate

Secretary, Mr. <HI>Lewis</HI>, which <HI>Swift</HI> in&s;tantly returned, with a Letter of Expo&s;tulation and Complaint. <HI>Harley</HI> invited him to dine, but he refu&s;ed: He wrote to Mr. <HI>Lewis</HI> to mediate be|tween them, de&s;iring to be reconciled; but <HI>Swift</HI> &s;ent him word, that he expected further Satis|faction. <HI>Harley</HI> replied, if he would come and &s;ee him, he would make him ea&s;y; but <HI>Swift</HI> in|&s;i&s;ted he &s;hould apologize by Me&s;&s;age, and de|clared, that otherwi&s;e he <HI>would ca&s;t him off</HI>.</P>
<P><HI>Swift</HI> would not &s;uffer even negative Incivili|ties from tho&s;e, who, if by their Station they had not been his Superiors, would have been his Equals by Learning and Parts. It happened that having one Day dined with Mr. <HI>St. John</HI>, who was then Secretary of State, and remarked that he appeared to be much out of Temper, he took the fir&s;t Opportunity to &s;ee him alone, and warn|ed him never to behave to him with &s;ilent Re|&s;erve, for that he would not be treated like a School-boy. <HI>I expect</HI> (&s;ays he,) <HI>that if you hear or &s;ee any thing to my Di&s;advantage, you would let me know it in plain Words, and not put me in Pain to gue&s;s, by the Change or Coldne&s;s of your Countenance and Behaviour; for it is what I would hardly bear from a crowned Head, and I think no Subject's Favour is worth it.</HI></P>
<P>The Secretary received the Reproof like a Friend, as it was given, and apologized for his Behaviour, by &s;aying that Bu&s;ine&s;s had kept him up &s;everal whole Nights, and Drinking one more; and, to make up Matters, he pre&s;&s;ed the Doctor to &s;tay to Dinner; which, however, he declined, as well becau&s;e he would not encourage a &s;econd Offence by too ea&s;ily pa&s;&s;ing over the fir&s;t, as becau&s;e he was engaged with another Friend.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="77">In a Letter which <HI>Swift</HI> wrote to Lord <HI>Oxford</HI> after the Connection between them was broken, he &s;ays,

<P>This Conduct of the Dean was not the Effect of Pride and Self-Sufficiency, but of true Dignity of Mind; for he exacted nothing which, in his Turn, he did not pay, nor a&s;ked more for him|&s;elf than others who&s;e Preten&s;ions or Circum|&s;tances were the &s;ame. When he was de&s;ired by Lord <HI>Oxford</HI> to introduce Dr. <HI>Parnell</HI> to his Ac|quaintance, he refu&s;ed, upon this Principle, <HI>That a Man of Genius was a Character &s;uperior to that of a Lord in High Station</HI>; he therefore obliged his Lord&s;hip to walk with his Trea&s;urer's Staff, from Room to Room, through his own Lev&eacute;e, enquiring which was Dr. <HI>Parnell</HI>, in order to in|troduce him&s;elf, and beg the Honour of his Ac|quaintance.</P>
<P>Upon the Arrival of Lord <HI>Carteret</HI>, who was appointed Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland</HI>, in that Kingdom, &s;oon after Dean <HI>Swift</HI>'s Fourth Let|ter of the <HI>Draper</HI>, &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages were &s;elected as &s;ufficient Ground for a Pro&s;ecution, and his Excellency and Council publi&s;hed a Proclama|tion, offering 300<HI>l.</HI> Reward for a Di&s;covery of the Author. This Proclamation gave the Dean
<PB N="74" REF="78">
a remarkable Opportunity to illu&s;trate his Cha|racter. It happened that his Butler, whom he had employed as his Amanuen&s;is, and who alone was tru&s;ted with the Secret, went out in the Af|ternoon of the Day of the Proclamation, with|out Leave, and &s;taid out the whole Night, and Part of the next Day. There was great Rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that he had made an Information, and having received his Reward, would never return. The Man, however, came home in the Even|ing, and the Dean was advi&s;ed by his Friends to take no Notice of his Fault, le&s;t he &s;hould be provoked to a Breach of Tru&s;t, from the Dread of which his Return had ju&s;t delivered them. But the Dean rejected this Coun&s;el with the ut|mo&s;t Di&s;dain, and commanding the Man into his Pre&s;ence, ordered him immediately to &s;trip off his Livery, and leave the Hou&s;e. <HI>You Vil|lain</HI>, (&s;aid he,) <HI>I know I am in your Power, and for that very Rea&s;on I will the le&s;s bear with your In&s;olence or Neglect</HI>.</P>
<P>The Man, in very &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Terms, con|fe&s;&s;ed that he had been drinking all Night, and intreated to be forgiven, but <HI>Swift</HI> was inexora|ble: He then begged that he might be confined in &s;ome Part of the Hou&s;e &s;o long as the Procla|mation could entitle him to any Reward, le&s;t when he was driven from his Service, and de&s;ti|tute of another, the Temptation might be too &s;trong for his Virtue, and his Di&s;tre&s;s might in|volve him in a Crime which he mo&s;t abhorred. <HI>Swift</HI>, however, was &s;till inexorable, and the Man was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. During all the Time of Danger, <HI>Swift</HI> ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed to contribute one Farthing towards his Support, nor could he be per&s;uaded to &s;ee his Face: But when the
<PB N="75" REF="79">
Time limited in the Proclamation was expired, he was permitted to return to his Service. Soon afterwards he was called ha&s;tily up by the Dean, who, without any Preface, again ordered him to &s;trip off his Livery, put on his own Cloaths, and then come up again. The poor Fellow, tho' he was greatly a&s;toni&s;hed at this Proceeding, knew <HI>Swift</HI> too well to expo&s;tulate, and there|fore, with whatever Reluctance, obeyed. When he returned, the Dean ordered the other Ser|vants to be called up, who immediately attend|ed; expecting that the Butler was to be di&s;mi&s;|&s;ed <HI>in terrorem</HI>, and that they &s;hould be warned, in very &s;evere Terms, of his Offence. <HI>Swift</HI>, as &s;oon as he had ranged th$m together before him, ordered them to take Notice, that <HI>Robert</HI> was no longer his Servant: <HI>He is now</HI>, (&s;aid the Dean,) <HI>Mr.</HI> Blakely, <HI>the Verger of</HI> St. Patrick<HI>'s Cathedral, a Place which I give him as a Reward for his Fidelity</HI>. The Value of this Place is be|tween Thirty and Forty Pounds a Year. How|ever, <HI>Robert</HI> would not quit his Ma&s;ter, but con|tinued to be his Butler &s;ome Years afterwards.</P>
<P>In this In&s;tance the Dean exerci&s;ed his Pride, his Fortitude, and his Equity, in a Manner pe|culiar to him&s;elf; and though there are many who would have equally rewarded &s;uch Fide|lity, there are few who would have ventured to wait the I&s;&s;ue of &s;o &s;evere and dangerous a Pro|bation.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dean</HI> u&s;ed to remon&s;trate, with great Freedom, again&s;t &s;uch Mea&s;ures as he di&s;appro|ved; and Lord <HI>Carteret</HI> having gained the Ad|vantage of him in &s;ome Di&s;pute concerning the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of <HI>Ireland</HI>, he cried out, in a violent Pa&s;&s;ion; <HI>What the Vengeance brought you among
<PB N="76" REF="80">
us? Get you gone, get you gone; pray God Al|mighty &s;end us our Boobies back again.</HI> A Reply, which &s;hewed at once the Turn, the Strength, and the Virtue of his Mind, as it was a fine Compliment to the Force of Rea&s;on, by which he had been ju&s;t foiled, and was expre&s;&s;ed with all the Vehemence of his Temper, all the Pecu|liarity of his Wit.</P>
<P>As <HI>Swift</HI> was zealous to pre&s;erve all the Deli|cacies of Conver&s;ation, he was always be&s;t plea|&s;ed when &s;ome of the Company were Ladies; and in one of his Letters to Lord <HI>Oxford</HI>, he &s;ays, <HI>Since Women have been left out of all our Meetings, except Parties of Play, or where wor&s;e De&s;igns are carried on, our Conver&s;ation has very much degenerated</HI>. In this In&s;tance, his Exam|ple is a Reproof to tho&s;e Pedants, who &s;uppo&s;e that Women are never in their proper Sphere, but in the Dre&s;&s;ing-Room or Nur&s;ery.</P>
<P>The following is an In&s;tance of the Dean's Humanity and Benevolence. &mdash; It happened that a young Gentleman of his Choir, being abroad with his Gun, &s;uffered irreparable Hurt by its accidentally going off. When the Dean heard of it, he expre&s;&s;ed great Concern, and having pau&s;ed a little; <HI>Well</HI>, (&s;aid he,) <HI>this will be a good Time at once to reward Merit and alleviate Di&s;tre&s;s; I will make him a Vicar</HI>; which he ac|cordingly did the &s;ame Hour.</P>
<P>The Dean was remarkable for performing the Duties of the Church with the utmo&s;t Punctua|lity and the mo&s;t rational Devotion, which makes the following Oddities the more remarkable, and &s;hews that, with all his Piety, he could not for|bear indulging the Peculiarity of his Humour when an Opportunity pre&s;ented it&s;elf, whatever
<PB N="77" REF="81">
might be the Impropriety of Time and Place. When he went to re&s;ide at his Living in the Country of <HI>Ireland</HI>, called <HI>Laracor</HI>, he gave pub|lick Notice that he would read Prayers on every <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> and <HI>Friday</HI>; which had never been practi&s;ed by his Predece&s;&s;ors. On the fir&s;t <HI>Wed|ne&s;day</HI> after he had &s;ummoned his Congregation at <HI>Laracor</HI>, he a&s;cended his De&s;k, and having &s;at &s;ome Time, with no other Auditor than his Clerk <HI>Roger</HI>, he ro&s;e up, and with a Compo&s;ure and Gravity that was upon this Occa&s;ion irre|&s;i&s;tibly ridiculous, he began, <HI>Dearly beloved</HI> Ro|ger, <HI>the Scripture moveth you and me in &s;undry Places</HI>; and &s;o proceeded to the End of the Service.</P>
<P>Soon after he was made Dean of <HI>St. Patrick</HI>'s, he had dined one <HI>Sunday</HI> with Dr. <HI>Raymond</HI>, Vi|car of <HI>Trim</HI>, and when the Bell had rung, and the People were a&s;&s;embled to Evening Prayers at the Church, which was not di&s;tant more than two Hundred Yards; <HI>Raymond</HI>, &s;aid he, I will lay you a Crown, that I begin Prayers before you this Afternoon; Dr. <HI>Raymond</HI> accepted the Wa|ger, and immediately both run as fa&s;t as they could towards the Church. <HI>Raymond</HI>, who was much nimbler than <HI>Swift</HI>, arrived fir&s;t at the Door, and when he entered the Church, walked decently towards the Reading De&s;k; <HI>Swift</HI> never &s;lackened hi$ Pace, but running up the I&s;le, left Dr. <HI>Raymond</HI> behind in the Middle of it, and &s;tepping into the De&s;k, without putting on a Sur|plice or opening the Book, began the Service in an audible Voice; and thus won the Wager.</P>
<P>One of the Chori&s;ters of <HI>St. Patrick</HI>'s, who was an excellent Singer, but a very indi&s;creet Man in his Conduct, having contracted &s;ome

Debts was obliged to ab&s;ent him&s;elf from his Duty, being afraid to apply for A&s;&s;i&s;tance to the Dean, who had often &s;tood his Friend in his Di&s;tre&s;&s;es. However, he ventured at length to appear one <HI>Sunday</HI> Evening at Prayer Time, at the above Cathedral, in order to perform in the Anthem. It happened, accidentally, that the Part which he was to &s;ing, began with the Words, <HI>Where &s;hall I go, whither &s;hall I fly from thy Pre|&s;ence?</HI> Which, when the Dean (not knowing be|fore that he was in the Church) heard, he &s;hook his Fi&s;t at him, and &s;aid, loud enough for all near him to hear, <HI>To Gaol, you Dog, to Gaol</HI>; which greatly alarmed the poor Man, who was more afraid of the Dean's Anger, than of the Re&s;entment of all his Creditors together. How|ever, after Prayers were over, <HI>Swift</HI>, who had a great Regard for the Chori&s;ter, &s;ent for him to the Deanry, and after reproving him &s;everely for his Indi&s;cretions, gave him Money to &s;atisfy all his Debts.</P>
<P>The Dean, who was very intimate with the Earl of <HI>Oxford</HI>, Prime Mini&s;ter in Queen <HI>Anne</HI>'s Reign, and who he thought was too &s;low in his political Motions, once told him &s;o, in a Man|ner which &s;hews both his Integrity and Freedom of Conver&s;ation with tho&s;e who have a pre|&s;criptive Right to Servility and Adulation. <HI>Swift</HI> had received a Pre&s;ent of a fine Tortoi&s;e&s;hell Snuff-box, lined with Gold, and painted on the In&s;ide of the Lid with a View of <HI>Venice</HI>. This Pre&s;ent he &s;hewed one Day to Lord <HI>Oxford</HI>, who having admired the Painting and Workman&s;hip, at la&s;t &s;pied a Figure &s;tudded on the Out&s;ide of the Bottom, which he thought re&s;embled a Goo&s;e; upon which, turning to the Dean, <HI>Jonathan</HI>,

<P>Dean <HI>Swift</HI> happened to be at the Ca&s;tle, in <HI>Dublin</HI>, in the Lieutenancy of the Earl of <HI>Pem|broke</HI>, when a learned Phy&s;ician was haranguing his Excellency upon the Nature and Qualities of Bees, which he was perpetually calling a Nation and Commonwealth; <HI>Yes, my Lord</HI>, &s;aid <HI>Swift, they are a Nation of great Antiquity; you know, my Lord</HI>, Mo&s;es <HI>takes Notice of them; he numbers the</HI> Hivites <HI>among the Nations which</HI> Jo&s;hua <HI>was appointed to conquer</HI>.</P>

<P>THIS &s;ingle Stick, which you now behold ingloriou&s;ly lying in that neglected Corner, I once knew in a flouri&s;hing State in a Fore&s;t: It was full of Sap, full of Leaves, and full of Boughs: But now in vain does the bu&s;y Art of Man pretend to vye with Nature, by tying that withered Bundle of Twigs to its &s;aple&s;s Trunk: It is now at be&s;t but the Rever&s;e of what it was, a Tree turned up&s;ide down, the Branches on the Earth, and the Root in the Air: It is now han|dled by every dirty Wench, condemned to do her Drudgery, and, by a capricious Kind of Fate, de&s;tined to make her Things clean, and be na&s;ty it&s;elf: At length, worn out to the Stumps in the Service of the Maids, it is either thrown out of Doors, or condemned to the la&s;t U&s;e, of kindling a Fire.

<HEAD><HI>BONS MOTS,</HI> or <HI>PITHY SAYINGS</HI> of Dean <HI>SWIFT,</HI> on various Subjects.</HEAD>
<P>SATYRISTS u&s;e the Publick as Pedants do a naughty Boy ready hor&s;ed for Di&s;cipline; expo&s;tulate, then plead the Nece&s;&s;ity of the Rod, and conclude every Period with a La&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="91">Wits are like Razors, which are mo&s;t apt to cut tho&s;e who u&s;e them when they have lo&s;t their Edge.</P>
<P>Wi&s;dom is like a Fox, which after long hunt|ing, mu&s;t be dug out at la&s;t: Or a Chee&s;e, which, by how much the richer, has the thicker, homelier, and coar&s;er Coat, and its Maggots the better: Or a Sack-Po&s;&s;et, in which the deeper you go, it is the &s;weeter: Or a Hen, who&s;e Cackling mu&s;t be valued and con&s;idered becau&s;e attended with an Egg: Or a Nut, which, unle&s;s cho&s;en with Judgment, may co&s;t a Tooth, and pay nothing but a Worm.</P>
<P>A Critick who reads only to cen&s;ure, is as bar|barous as a Judge, who &s;hould re&s;olve to hang all that came before him.</P>
<P>A Critick in Youth will be a Critick in old Age; and, like a Whore and an Alderman, ne|ver changes his Title nor his Nature.</P>
<P>He is carried on to the noble&s;t Writers by In|&s;tinct, as a Rat to the be&s;t Chee&s;e, or a Wa&s;p to the faire&s;t Fruit.</P>
<P>In the Peru&s;al of a Book he is like a Dog at a Fea&s;t, who&s;e Thoughts and Stomach are &s;et upon what the Gue&s;ts fling away; and con&s;equently &s;narls mo&s;t when there are fewe&s;t Bones.</P>
<P>Men in Misfortunes are like Men in the Dark, to whom all Colours are alike.</P>
<P>It is with Human Faculties as with Liquors, the lighte&s;t will ever be at the Top.</P>
<P>Satire is a Sort of Gla&s;s, wherein Beholders di&s;cover every Body's Face but their own.</P>
<P>Opinions, like Fa&s;hions, de&s;cend from tho&s;e of Quality down to the Vulgar, where they are dropped, and vani&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="92">The Stoical Scheme of &s;upplying our Wants by lopping off our De&s;ires, is like cutting off our Feet when we want Shoes.</P>
<P>Ill Company is like a Dog that dirts tho&s;e mo&s;t whom he loves be&s;t.</P>
<P>A Writer with a weak Head and a corrupt Heart, is like a hireling Jade, dull and yet vi|cious.</P>
<P>After ten glorious Campaigns, <HI>England</HI>, like the &s;ick Man, was ju&s;t expiring with all Sorts of good Symptoms.</P>
<P>A Copy of Ver&s;es kept in a Cabinet, and &s;hewn to few, is like a Virgin much &s;ought after and admired: But when publi&s;hed, like a com|mon Whore, whom any may purcha&s;e for half a Crown.</P>
<P>Eloquence &s;mooth and cutting, is like a Ra|zor whetted with Oil.</P>
<P>Jealou&s;y, like Fire, may &s;hrivel up Horns, but it makes them &s;tink.</P>
<P>A poor Man being a&s;ked how he did, &s;aid he was like a Wa&s;hball, always in Decay.</P>
<P>The Rich are, in trouble&s;ome Times, often of no U&s;e but to be plundered: Like &s;ome Sort of Birds, which are good for nothing but their Feathers.</P>
<P>Religion, like all other Things, is &s;oone&s;t put out of Countenance by being ridiculed.</P>
<P>Plying an in&s;ipid worthle&s;s Tract with grave and learned An&s;wers, is like flinging a Moun|tain upon a Worm, which, in&s;tead of being brui&s;ed, by the Advantage of its Littlene&s;s, lodg|eth under it unhurt.</P>
<P>Party is the Madne&s;s of Many for the Gain of a Few.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="93">There never was any Party, Faction, Sect, or Cabal what&s;oever, in which the mo&s;t ignorant were not the mo&s;t violent: For a Bee is not a bu&s;ier Animal than a Blockhead. However, &s;uch In&s;truments are nece&s;&s;ary to Politicians; and per|haps it may be with States as with Clocks, which mu&s;t have &s;ome dead Weight hanging at them, to help to regulate the Motion of the finer and more u&s;eful Parts.</P>
<P>To endeavour to work upon the Vulgar with fine Sen&s;e, is like attempting to hew Blocks with a Razor.</P>
<P>Fine Sen&s;e and exalted Sen&s;e are not half &s;o u&s;eful as common Sen&s;e; and he that will carry nothing about him but Gold, will be every Day at a Lo&s;s for want of readier Change.</P>
<P>Learning is like Mercury, one of the mo&s;t powerful and excellent Things in the World in &s;kilful Hands; in un&s;kilful, the mo&s;t mi&s;chie|vous.</P>
<P>The nice&s;t Con&s;titutions of Government are often like the fine&s;t Pieces of Clockwork; which depending on &s;o many Motions, are therefore more &s;ubject to be out of Order.</P>
<P>Every Man has ju&s;t as much Vanity as he wants Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Mode&s;ty, if it were to be recommended for nothing el&s;e, this were enough, that the pre|tending to little, leaves a Man at Ea&s;e, whereas Boa&s;ting requires a perpetual Labour to appear what he is not. If we have Sen&s;e, Mode&s;ty be&s;t proves it to others; if we have none, it be&s;t hides our Want of it. For as Blu&s;hing will &s;ometimes make a Whore pa&s;s for a virtuous Wo|man, &s;o Mode&s;ty may make a Fool &s;eem a Man of Sen&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="94">It is not &s;o much the being exempt from Faults, as the having overcome them, that is an Advantage to us: It being with the Follies of the Mind as with the Weeds of a Field, which if de&s;troyed and con&s;umed upon the Place of their Birth, enrich and improve it more than if none had ever &s;prung there.</P>
<P>To pardon tho&s;e Ab&s;urdities in our&s;elves, which we cannot &s;uffer in others, is neither better nor wor&s;e, than to be more willing to be Fools our|&s;elves, than to have others &s;o.</P>
<P>A Man &s;hould never be a&s;hamed to own he has been in the wrong; which is but &s;aying, in other Words, that he is wi&s;er To-day than he was Ye&s;terday.</P>
<P>Our Pa&s;&s;ions are like Convul&s;ion Fits, which, though they make us &s;tronger for a Time, leave us weaker ever after.</P>
<P>To be angry, is to revenge the Faults of others upon our&s;elves.</P>
<P>A brave Man thinks no one his Superior, who does him an Injury; for he has it then in his Power to make him&s;elf &s;uperior to the other, by forgiving it.</P>
<P>To relieve the Oppre&s;&s;ed is the mo&s;t glorious Act a Man is capable of; it is in &s;ome Mea&s;ure doing the Bu&s;ine&s;s of God and Providence.</P>
<P>Super&s;tition is the Spleen of the Soul.</P>
<P>Athei&s;ts put on a fal&s;e Courage and Alacrity in the Mid&s;t of their Darkne&s;s and Apprehen&s;ions; like Children, who, when they go in the Dark, will &s;ing for Fear.</P>
<P>An Athei&s;t is but a mad ridiculous Derider of Piety, but a Hypocrite makes a &s;ober Je&s;t of God and Religion. He finds it ea&s;ier to be upon his Knees than to ri&s;e and do a good Action;
<PB N="91" REF="95">
like an impudent Debtor, who goes every Day and talks familiarly to his Creditor without ever paying what he owes.</P>
<P>What <HI>Tully</HI> &s;ays of War, may be applied to Di&s;puting; it &s;hould be always &s;o managed as to remember, that the only End of it is Peace: But generally true Di&s;putants are like true Sport&s;men, their whole Delight is in the Pur&s;uit; and a Di&s;|putant no more cares for the Truth than a Sport&s;|man for the Hare.</P>
<P>The Scripture, in Time of Di&s;putes, is like an open Town in the Time of War, which &s;erves indifferently the Occa&s;ions of both Par|ties; each makes U&s;e of it for the pre&s;ent Turn, and then re&s;igns it for the next Comer to do the &s;ame.</P>
<P>When Men grow virtuous in their old Age, they only make Sacrifice to God of the Devil's Leavings.</P>
<P>When we are young, we are &s;lavi&s;hly em|ployed in procuring &s;omething whereby we may live comfortably when we grow old; and when we are old, we perceive it is too late to live as we propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>People are &s;candalized, if one laughs at what they call a &s;erious Thing. Suppo&s;e I were to have my Head cut off To-morrow, and all the World were talking of it To-day, yet why may not I laugh to think, what a Bu&s;tle is here about my Head.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t Advantage I know of being thought a Wit by the World, is, that it gives one the greater Freedom of playing the Fool.</P>
<P>Wherever I find a great deal of Gratitude in a poor Man, I take it for granted there would be as much Genero&s;ity if he were a rich Man.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="96">Giving Advice is many Times only the Privi|lege of &s;aying a fooli&s;h thing one's &s;elf, under Pretence of hindering another from doing one.</P>
<P>It is with Followers at Court, as with Follow|ers on the Road, who fir&s;t be&s;patter tho&s;e who go before, and then tread on their Heels.</P>
<P>He who marries a Wife only becau&s;e he can|not live cha&s;tely, is much like a Man who, find|ing a few Humours in his Body, re&s;olves to wear a perpetual Bli&s;ter.</P>
<P>Married People, for being &s;o clo&s;ely united, are but the apter to part; as Knots, the harder they are pulled, break the &s;ooner.</P>
<P>There is nothing wanting to make all rational and di&s;intere&s;ted People in the World of one Re|ligion, but that they &s;hould talk together every Day.</P>
<P>Men are grateful in the &s;ame Degree that they are re&s;entful.</P>
<P>That Character in Conver&s;ation which com|monly pa&s;&s;es for agreeable, is made up of Civi|lity and Fal&s;hood.</P>
<P>Some People are recommended for a giddy Kind of Good Humour, which is as much a Virtue as Drunkenne&s;s.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e People only will con&s;tantly trouble you with doing little Offices for them, who lea&s;t de|&s;erve you &s;hould do them any.</P>
<P>Prai&s;e is like Ambergri&s;e: A little Whiff of it, and by Snatches, is very agreeable: But when a Man holds a whole Lump of it to your No&s;e, it is a Stink, and &s;trikes you down.</P>
<P>The People all running to the Capital City, is like a Confluence of all the Animal Spirits to the Heart; a Symptom that the Con&s;titution is in Danger.</P>
