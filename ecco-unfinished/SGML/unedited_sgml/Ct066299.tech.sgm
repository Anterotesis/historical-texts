<HEAD>THE
Con&s;olidator, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IT Cannot be unknown to any that
have travell'd into the Dominions
of the Czar of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> that this
famous ri&s;ing Monarch, having &s;tu|died
all Methods for the Encrea&s;e of his
Power, and the Enriching as well as Po|li&s;hing
his Subjects, has travell'd through
mo&s;t part of <HI>Europe,</HI> and vi&s;ited the Courts
of the greate&s;t Princes; from whence, by
his own Ob&s;ervation, as well as by car|rying
with him Arti&s;ts in mo&s;t u&s;eful
Knowledge, he has tran&s;mitted mo&s;t of
our General Practice, e&s;pecially in War
and Trade, to his own Unpolite People;
and the Effects of this Curio&s;ity of his are
exceeding vi&s;ible in his pre&s;ent Proceed|ings;
for by the Improvements he ob|tained
in his <HI>European</HI> Travels, he has
Modell'd his Armies, form'd new Fleets,
&s;ettled Foreign Negoce in &s;everal remote
Parts of the World; and we now &s;ee
<PB N="2" REF="4">
his Forces be&s;ieging &s;trong Towns, with
regular Approaches; and his Engineers
rai&s;ing Batteries, throwing Bombs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
like other Nations; whereas before, they
had nothing of Order among them, but
carried all by <HI>Ou&s;laught</HI> and <HI>Scalado,</HI>
wherein they either prevailed by the
Force of Irre&s;i&s;tible Multitude, or were
Slaughter'd by heaps, and left the Ditches
of their Enemies fill'd with their Dead
Bodies.</P>
<P>We &s;ee their Armies now form'd into
regular Battalions; and their <HI>Strelitz Mu&s;|queteers,</HI>
a People equivalent to the <HI>Turks
Janizaries,</HI> cloath'd like our Guards,
firing in Platoons, and behaving them|&s;elves
with extraordinary Bravery and
Order.</P>
<P>We &s;ee their Ships now compleatly
fitted, built and furni&s;h'd, by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
and <HI>Dutch</HI> Arti&s;ts, and their Men of War
Cruize in the <HI>Baltick.</HI> Their New City
of <HI>Petersburgh</HI> built by the pre&s;ent Czar,
begins now to look like our <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI>
fitted with Wet and Dry Docks, Store|hou&s;es,
and Magazines of Naval Prepa|rations,
va&s;t and Incredible; which may
<PB N="3" REF="5">
&s;erve to remind us, how we once taught
the <HI>French</HI> to build Ships, till they are
grown able to teach us how to u&s;e
them.</P>
<P>As to Trade, our large Fleets to <HI>Arch-Angel</HI>
may &s;peak for it, where we now
&s;end 100 Sail yearly, in&s;tead of 8 or 9,
which were the greate&s;t number we ever
&s;ent before; and the Importation of To|baccoes
from <HI>England</HI> into his Dominions,
would &s;till increa&s;e the Trade thither, was
not the Covetou&s;ne&s;s of our own Mer|chants
the Ob&s;truction of their Advan|tages.
But all this by the by.</P>
<P>As this great Monarch has Improved
his Country, by introducing the Manners
and Cu&s;toms of the Politer Nations of <HI>Eu|rope;</HI>
&s;o, with Indefatigable Indu&s;try, he
has &s;ettled a new, but con&s;tant Trade,
between his Country and <HI>China,</HI> by Land;
where his Carravans go twice or thrice a
Year, as Numerous almo&s;t, and as &s;trong,
as tho&s;e from <HI>Egypt</HI> to <HI>Per&s;ia:</HI> Nor is the
Way &s;horter, or the De&s;arts they pa&s;s
over le&s;s wild and uninhabitable, only
that they are not &s;o &s;ubject to Flouds of
Sand, <HI>if that Term be proper,</HI> or to Troops
<PB N="4" REF="6">
of <HI>Arabs,</HI> to de&s;troy them by the way;
for this powerful Prince, to make this
terrible Journey feazible to his Subjects,
has built Forts, planted Collonies and
Gari&s;ons at proper Di&s;tances; where,
though they are &s;eated in Countries in|tirely
Barren, and among uninhabited
Rocks and Sands; yet, by his continual
furni&s;hing them from his own Stores, the
Merchants travelling are reliev'd on good
Terms, and meet both with Convoy and
Refre&s;hment.</P>
<P>More might be &s;aid of the admirable
Decorations of this Journey, and how &s;o
prodigious an Attempt is made ea&s;y; &s;o
that now they have an exact Corre&s;pon|dence,
and drive a prodigious Trade be|tween
<HI>Mu&s;cow</HI> and <HI>Tonquin;</HI> but having
a longer Voyage in Hand, I &s;hall not de|tain
the Reader, nor keep him till he
grows too big with Expectation.</P>
<P>Now, as all Men know the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI>
are an Ancient, Wi&s;e, Polite, and mo&s;t
Ingenious People; &s;o the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> be|gun
to reap the Benefit of this open
Trade; and not only to grow exceeding
Rich by the bartering for all the Wealth
<PB N="5" REF="7">
of tho&s;e Ea&s;tern Countries; but to poli&s;h
and refine their Cu&s;toms and Manners, as
much on that &s;ide as they have from their
<HI>European</HI> Improvements on this.</P>
<P>And as the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> have many &s;orts
of Learning which the&s;e Parts of the
World never heard of, &s;o all tho&s;e u&s;eful
Inventions which we admire our &s;elves &s;o
much for, are vulgar and common with
them, and were in u&s;e long before our
Parts of the World were Inhabited. Thus
<HI>Gun-powder, Printing,</HI> and the u&s;e of the
<HI>Magnet</HI> and <HI>Compa&s;s,</HI> which we call Mo|dern
Inventions, are not only far from
being Inventions, but fall &s;o far &s;hort of
the Perfection of Art they have attained
to, that it is hardly Credible, what won|derful
things we are told of from thence,
and all the Voyages the Author has made
thither being imploy'd another way, have
not yet furni&s;h'd him with the Particulars
fully enough to tran&s;mit them to view; not
but that he is preparing a Scheme of all
tho&s;e excellent Arts tho&s;e Nations are
Ma&s;ters of, for publick View, by way of
Detection of the mon&s;trous Ignorance
and Deficiencies of <HI>European</HI> Science;
which may &s;erve as a <HI>L$$$icon Technicum</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="8">
for this pre&s;ent Age, with u&s;eful Dia|grams
for that purpo&s;e; wherein I &s;hall
not fail to acqaint the World, 1. With
the Art of <HI>Gunnery,</HI> as Practis'd in <HI>China</HI>
long before the War of the <HI>Giants,</HI> and
by which tho&s;e Pre&s;umptuous Animals
fired Red-hot Bullets right up into Hea|ven,
and made a Breach &s;ufficient to en|courage
them to a General Storm; but
being Repul&s;ed with great Slaughter, they
gave over the Siege for that time. This
memorable part of Hi&s;tory &s;hall be a
faithful Abridgement of <HI>Ibra chizra-le|peglizar,
Hi&s;toriagrapher-Royal</HI> to the Em|peror
of <HI>China,</HI> who wrote <HI>Anno Mundi</HI>
114. his Volumes extant, in the Publick
Library at <HI>Tonquin,</HI> Printed in Leaves of
Vitrify'd Diamond, by an admirable
Dexterity, &s;truck all at an oblique Mo|tion,
the Engine remaining intire, and
&s;till fit for u&s;e, in the Chamber of the
Emperor's Rarities.</P>
<P>And here I &s;hall give you a Draft of
the Engine it &s;elf, and a Plan of its Ope|ration,
and the wonderful Dexterity of
its Performance.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="9">
If the&s;e Labours of mine &s;hall prove
&s;ucce&s;sful, I may in my next Journey that
way, take an Ab&s;tract of their mo&s;t ad|mirable
Tracts in Navigation, and the
My&s;teries of <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Mathematicks; which
out-do all Modern Invention at th$$
Rate, that 'tis Inconceivable: In this E|laborate
Work I mu&s;t run thro' the 365
Volumes of <HI>Augro-machi-lanquaro-zi,</HI> the
mo&s;t ancient Mathematician in all <HI>China:</HI>
From thence I &s;hall give a De&s;cription
of a Fleet of Ships of 100000 Sail, built
at the Expence of the Emperor <HI>Tangro</HI>
the 15th; who having Notice of the Ge|neral
Deluge, prepar'd the&s;e Ve&s;&s;els, to
every City and Town in his Dominions
One, and in Bulk proportion'd to the
number of its Inhabitants; into which
Ve&s;&s;el all the People, with &s;uch Movea|bles
as they thought $it to &s;ave, and with
120 Days Provi&s;ions, were receiv'd at the
time of the Floud; and the re&s;t of their
Goods being put into great Ve&s;&s;els made
of <HI>China</HI> Ware, and fa&s;t luted down on
the top, were pre&s;erv'd unhurt by the
Water: The&s;e Ships they furni&s;h'd with
600 Fathom of Chain in&s;tead of Cables;
which being fa&s;tned by wonderful Arts
<PB N="8" REF="10">
to the Earth, every Ve&s;&s;el rid out the
Deluge ju&s;t at the Town's end; &s;o that
when the Waters abated, the People had
nothing to do, but to open the Doors
made in the Ship-&s;ides, and come out,
repair their Hou&s;es, open the great <HI>China</HI>
Pots their Goods were in, and &s;o put
them&s;elves in <HI>Statu Quo.</HI></P>
<P>The Draft of one of the&s;e Ships I may
perhaps obtain by my Intere&s;t in the pre|&s;ent
Emperor's Court, as it has been pre|&s;erv'd
ever &s;ince, and con&s;tantly repair'd,
riding at Anchor in a great Lake, about
100 Miles from <HI>Tonquin;</HI> in which all
the People of that City were pre&s;erv'd,
amounting by their Computation to about
a Million and half.</P>
<P>And as the&s;e things mu&s;t be very u&s;eful
in the&s;e Parts, to abate the Pride and
Arrogance of our Modern Undertakers of
great Enterprizes, Authors of &s;trange Fo|reign
Accounts, Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;acti|ons,
and the like; if Time and Opportu|nity
permit, I may let them know, how
Infinitely we are out-done by tho&s;e refi|ned
Nations, in all manner of Mechanick
Improvements and Arts; and in di&s;cour|&s;ing
<PB N="9" REF="11">
of this, it will nece&s;&s;arily come in
my way to &s;peak of a mo&s;t Noble Inven|tion,
being an Engine I would recom|mend
to all People to whom <HI>'tis nece&s;&s;ary
to have a good Memory;</HI> and which I de|&s;ign,
if po&s;&s;ible, to obtain a Draft of,
that it may be Erected in our Royal So|cieties
Laboratory: It has the wonder|fulle&s;t
Operations in the World: One
part of it furni&s;hes a Man of Bu&s;ine&s;s to
di&s;patch his Affairs &s;trangely; for if he
be a Merchant, he &s;hall write his Letters
with one Hand, and Copy them with the
other; if he is po&s;ting his Books, he
&s;hall po&s;t the Debtor &s;ide with one Hand,
and the Creditor with the other; if he be
a Lawyer, he draws his Drafts with one
Hand, and Ingro&s;&s;es them with the other.</P>
<P>Another part of it furni&s;hes him with
&s;uch an Expeditious way of Writing, or
Tran&s;cribing, that a Man cannot &s;peak
&s;o fa&s;t, but he that hears &s;hall have it
down in Writing before 'tis &s;poken;
and a Preacher &s;hall deliver him&s;elf to his
Auditory, and having this Engine before
him, &s;hall put down every thing he &s;ays
in Writing at the &s;ame time; and &s;o ex|actly
is this Engine &s;quar'd by Lines and
<PB N="10" REF="12">
Rules, that it does not require him that
Writes to keep his Eye upon it.</P>
<P>I am told, in &s;ome Parts of <HI>China,</HI> they
had arriv'd to &s;uch a Perfection of Know|ledge,
as to under&s;tand one anothers
Thoughts; and that it was found to be
an excellent Pre&s;ervative to humane So|ciety,
again&s;t all &s;orts of Frauds, Cheats,
Sharping, and many Thou&s;and <HI>European</HI>
Inventions of that Nature, <HI>at which only
we can be &s;aid to out-do tho&s;e Nations.</HI></P>
<P>I confe&s;s, I have not yet had lei&s;ure to
travel tho&s;e Parts, having been di|verted
by an accidental Opportunity of a
new Voyage I had occa&s;ion to make for
farther Di&s;coveries, and which the Plea|&s;ure
and U&s;efulne&s;s thereof having been
very great, I have omitted the other for
the pre&s;ent, but &s;hall not fail to make a
Vi&s;it to tho&s;e Parts the fir&s;t Opportunity,
and &s;hall give my Country-men the be&s;t
Account I can of tho&s;e things; for I
doubt not in Time to bring our Nation,
&s;o fam'd for improving other People's
Di&s;coveries, to be as wi&s;e as any of tho&s;e
Heathen Nations; I wi&s;h I had the &s;ame
Pro&s;pect of making them half &s;o hone&s;t.
<PB N="11" REF="13">
I had &s;pent but a few Months in this
Country, but my &s;earch after the Prodigy
of humane Knowledge the People a|bounds
with, led me into Acquaintance
with &s;ome of their principal Arti&s;ts, En|gineers,
and Men of Letters; and I was
a&s;toni&s;h'd at every Day's Di&s;covery of
new and of unheard-of Worlds of Learn|ing;
but I Improv'd in the Superficial
Knowledge of their General, by no body
&s;o much as by my Conver&s;ation with the
Library-keeper of <HI>Tonquin,</HI> by whom I
had Admi&s;&s;ion into the va&s;t Collection of
Books, which the Emperors of that Coun|try
have trea&s;ur'd up.</P>
<P>It would be endle&s;s to give you a Ca|talogue,
and they admit of no Strangers
to write any thing down, but what the
Memory can retain, you are welcome to
carry away with you; and among&s;t the
wonderful Volumes of Antient and Mo|dern
Learning, I could not but take No|tice
of a few; which, be&s;ides tho&s;e I
mentioned before, I &s;aw, when I lookt
over this va&s;t Collection; and a larger
Account may be given our next.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="14">
It would be needle&s;s to Tran&s;cribe the
<HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Character, or to put their Alpha$bet
into our Letters, becau&s;e the Word
would be both Unintelligible, and very
hard to Pronounce; and therefore, to
avoid hard Words, and Hyroglyphicks
I'll tran&s;late them as well as I can.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Cla&s;s I came to of Books, was
the Con&s;titutions of the Empire; the&s;e
are va&s;t great Volumes, and have a &s;ort of
Engine like our <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> to remove
$em, and with placing them in a Frame, by
turning a Screw, open'd the Leaves, and
folded them this way, or that, as the
Reader de&s;ires. It was pre&s;ent Death for
the Library-keeper to refu&s;e the meane&s;t
<HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Subject to come in and read them
for 'tis their Maxim, <HI>That all People ought
to know the Laws by which they are to be go|vern'd;</HI>
and as above all People, we find
no Fools in this Country; &s;o the Empe|rors,
though they &s;eem to be Arbitrary,
enjoy the greate&s;t Authority in the World,
by always ob&s;erving, with the greate&s;t
Exactne&s;s, the <HI>Pacta Conventa</HI> of their
Government&punc; From the&s;e Principles it
is impo&s;&s;ible we &s;hould ever hear, either
<PB N="13" REF="15">
of the Tyranny of Princes, or Rebellion
of Subjects, in all their Hi&s;tories.</P>
<P>At the Entrance into this Cla&s;s, you
find &s;ome Ancient Comments, upon the
Con&s;titution of the Empire, written ma|ny
Ages before we pretend the World
began; but above all, One I took parti|cular
notice of, which might bear this
Title, <HI>Natural Right prov'd Superior to
Temporal Power;</HI> wherein the old Author
proves, <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Emperors were Origi|nally
made &s;o, by Nature's directing the
People, to place the Power of Govern|ment
in the mo&s;t worthy Per&s;on they
could find; and the Author giving a mo&s;t
exact Hi&s;tory of 2000 Emperors, brings
them into about 35 or 36 Periods of Lines
when the Race ended; and when a Col|lective
A&s;&s;embly of the Nobles, Cities,
and People, Nominated a new Family to
the Government.</P>
<P>This being an heretical Book as to <HI>Eu|ropean</HI>
Politicks, and our Learned Au|thors
having long &s;ince exploded this Do|ctrine,
and prov'd that Kings and Em|perors
came down from Heaven with
Crowns on their Heads, and all their Sub|jects
<PB N="14" REF="16">
were born with Saddles on the
Backs; I thought fit to leave it where
found it, lea&s;t our excellent Tracts of Sir
<HI>Robert Filmer,</HI> Dr. <HI>Hammond,</HI> L... <HI>y, S..</HI>
and Others, who have &s;o learnedly treat|ed
of the more u&s;eful Doctrine of Pa&s;&s;ive
Obedience, Divine Right, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;hould be
bla&s;phem'd' by the Mob, grow into Con|tempt
of the People; and they &s;hould
take upon them to que&s;tion their Supe|riors
for the Blood of <HI>Algernon Sidney</HI>
and <HI>Argyle.</HI></P>
<P>For I take the Doctrines of Pa&s;&s;ive O|bedience,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> among the States-men, to
be like the Copernican Sy&s;tem of the
Earths Motion among Philo&s;ophers;
which, though it be contrary to all an|tient
Knowledge, and not capable of
Demon&s;tration, yet is adher'd to in gene|ral,
becau&s;e by this they can better &s;olve,
and give a more rational Account of &s;e|veral
dark Phaenomena in Nature, than
they could before.</P>
<P>Thus our Modern States-men approve
of this Scheme of Government; not that
it admits of any rational Defence, much
le&s;s of Demon&s;tration, but becau&s;e by
<PB N="15" REF="17">
this Method they can the better ex|plain,
as well as defend, all Coertion in
Ca&s;es inva&s;ive of Natural Right, than they
could before.</P>
<P>Here I found two famous Volumes in
Chyrurgery, being an exact De&s;cription of
the Circulation of the Blood, di&s;covered
long before King <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Allegory of
the Bucket's going to the Well; with &s;e|veral
curious Methods by which the De|mon&s;tration
was to be made &s;o plain, as
would make even the worthy Doctor
<HI>B</HI>&mdash;him&s;elf become a Convert to his
own Eye-&s;ight, make him damn his own
Elaborate Book, and think it wor&s;e Non|&s;ence
than ever the Town had the Free|dom
to imagine.</P>
<P>All our Philo&s;ophers are Fools, and
their Tran&s;actions a parcel of empty Stuff, to
the Experiments of the Royal Societies
in this Country. Here I came to a Learn|ed
Tract of Winds, which outdoes even
the Sacred Text, and would make us be|lieve
it was not wrote to tho&s;e People;
they tell Folks whence it comes, and
whither it goes. There you have an
Account how to make Gla&s;&s;es of Hogs
<PB N="16" REF="18">
Eyes, that can &s;ee the Wind; and the
give &s;trange Accounts both of its regular
and irregular Motions, its Compo&s;itions
and Quantities; from whence, by a &s;ort
of Algebra, they can ca&s;t up its Dura|tion,
Violence, and Extent: In the&s;e
Calculations, &s;ome &s;ay, tho&s;e Author$
have been &s;o exact, that they can, as our
Philo&s;ophers &s;ay of Comets, &s;tate their
Revolutions, and tell us how many
Storms there &s;hall happen to any Period
of time, and when; and perhaps this
may be with much about the &s;ame
Truth.</P>
<P>It was a certain Sign <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> had never
been at <HI>China;</HI> for, had he &s;een the 216th
Volume of the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Navigation, in
the Library I am &s;peaking of, a large Book
in Double Folio, wrote by the Famous
<HI>Mira-cho-cho-la&s;mo,</HI> Vice-Admiral of <HI>Chi|na,</HI>
and &s;aid to be printed there about
2000 Years before the Deluge, in the
Chapter of Tides he would have &s;een the
Rea&s;on of all the certain and uncertain
Fluxes and Refluxes of that Element$
how the exact Pace is kept between the
Moon and the Tides, with a mo&s;t elabor|rate
Di&s;cour&s;e there, of the Power of
<PB N="17" REF="19">
Sympathy, and the manner how the hea|venly
Bodies Influence the Earthly: Had
he &s;een this, the <HI>Stagyrite</HI> would never
have Drowned him&s;elf, becau&s;e he could
not comprehend this My&s;tery.</P>
<P>'Tis farther related of this Famous Au|thor,
that he was no Native of this World,
but was Born in the <HI>Moon,</HI> and coming hi|ther
to make Di&s;coveries, by a &s;trange In|vention
arrived to by the <HI>Virtuo&s;oes</HI> of that
habitable World, the Emperor of <HI>China</HI>
prevailed with him to &s;tay and improve his
Subjects, in the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Accom|pli&s;hments
of tho&s;e <HI>Lunar</HI> Regions; and
no wonder the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> are &s;uch exqui&s;ite
Arti&s;ts, and Ma&s;ters of &s;uch &s;ublime Know|ledge,
when this Famous Author has ble&s;t
them with &s;uch unaccountable Methods
of Improvement.</P>
<P>There was abundance of va&s;t Cla&s;&s;es
full of the Works of this wonderful Phi|lo&s;opher:
He gave the <HI>how,</HI> the <HI>modus</HI> of
all the &s;ecret Operations of Nature; and
told us, how Sen&s;ation is convey'd to and
from the Brain; why Re&s;piration pre|&s;erves
Life; and how Locomotion is
directed to, as well as perform'd by the

Parts. There are &s;ome Anatomical Di&s;|&s;ections
of Thought, and a Mathematical

Memory, with all its Locks and Keys.</P>
<P>There you have that part of the Head
turn'd in-&s;ide outward, in which Nature
has placed the Materials of reflecting;

$he&s;e Gla&s;&s;es to be had very cheap, and I
having declar'd my Re&s;olution of under|taking
a Voyage thither, I deferred my
$e&s;ign, and &s;hall defer my treating of
them, till I give &s;ome Account of my
$rrival there.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="38">
But above all his Inventions for making
this Voyage, I &s;aw none more plea&s;ant
or profitable, than a certain Engine for|med
in the &s;hape of a Chariot, on the
Backs of two va&s;t Bodies with extended
Wings, which &s;pread about 50 Yards in
Breadth, compos'd of Feathers &s;o nicely
put together, that no Air could pa&s;s;
and as the Bodies were made of <HI>Lunar
Earth</HI> which would bear the Fire, the
Cavities were fill'd with an Ambient
Flame, which fed on a certain Spirit depo|&s;ited
in a proper quantity, to la&s;t out the
Voyage; and this Fire &s;o order'd as to move
about &s;uch Springs and Wheels as kept
the Wings in a mo&s;t exact and regular
Motion, always a&s;cendant; thus the Per|&s;on
being placed in this airy Chariot,
drinks a certain dozing Draught, that
throws him into a gentle Slumber, and
Dreaming all the way, never wakes till
he comes to his Journey's end.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Con&s;olidator.</HEAD>
<P>THe&s;e Engines are call'd in their
Country Language, <HI>Dupeka&s;&s;es;</HI>
and according to the Ancient <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> or
<PB N="37" REF="39">
<HI>Tartarian, Apezolanthukani&s;tes;</HI> in <HI>Eng|li&s;h,</HI> a <HI>Con&s;olidator.</HI></P>
<P>The Compo&s;ition of this Engine is very
admirable; for, as is before noted, 'tis
all made up of Feathers, and the quality
of the Feathers, is no le&s;s wonderful than
their Compo&s;ition; and therefore, I hope
the Reader will bear with the De&s;cription
for the &s;ake of the Novelty, &s;ince I a&s;&s;ure
him &s;uch things as the&s;e are not to be
&s;een in every Country.</P>
<P>The number of Feathers are ju&s;t 513,
they are all of a length and breadth ex|actly,
which is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the
<HI>floating Figure,</HI> or el&s;e one &s;ide or any one
part being wider or longer than the re&s;t,
it would interrupt the motion of the
whole Engine; only there is one extra|ordinary
Feather which, as there is an
odd one in the number, is placed in the
Center, and is the Handle, or rather Rud|der
to the whole Machine: This Feather
is every way larger than its Fellows, 'tis
almo&s;t as long and broad again; but a|bove
all, its Quill or Head is much lar|ger,
and it has <HI>as it were</HI> &s;everal &s;mall
bu&s;hing Feathers round the bottom of it,
<PB N="38" REF="40">
which all make but one pre&s;iding or &s;u|perintendent
Feather, to guide, regulate,
and pilot the whole Body.</P>
<P>Nor are the&s;e common Feathers, but
they are pickt and cull'd out of all parts
of the Lunar Country, by the Command
of the Prince; and every Province &s;ends
up the be&s;t they can find, <HI>or ought to do
&s;o at lea&s;t,</HI> or el&s;e they are very much to
blame; for the Employment they are put
to being of &s;o great u&s;e to the Publick,
and the Voyage or Flight &s;o exceeding
high, it would be very ill done if, when
the King &s;ends his Letters about the Na|tion,
to pick him up the be&s;t Feathers
they can lay their Hands on, they &s;hould
&s;end weak, decay'd, or half-grown Fea|thers,
and yet &s;ometimes it happens &s;o;
and once there was &s;uch rotten Feathers
collected, whether it was a bad Year for
Feathers, or whether the People that ga|ther'd
them had a mind to abu&s;e their
King; but the Feathers were &s;o bad, the
Engine was good for nothing, but broke
before it was got half way; and by a
double Misfortune, this happen'd to be
at an unlucky time, when the King him|&s;elf
had re&s;olv'd on a Voyage, or Flight
<PB N="39" REF="41">
to the <HI>Moon;</HI> but being deceiv'd, by the
unhappy Mi&s;carriage of the deficient Fea|thers,
he fell down from &s;o great a height,
that he &s;truck him&s;elf again&s;t his own
Palace, and beat his Head off.</P>
<P>Nor had the Sons of this Prince much
better Succe&s;s, tho' the fir&s;t of them was
a Prince mightily belov'd by his Subjects;
but his Misfortunes chiefly proceeded from
his having made u&s;e of one of the Engines
&s;o very long, that the Feathers were quite
worn out, and good for nothing: He
u&s;ed to make a great many Voyages and
Flights into the <HI>Moon,</HI> and then would
make his Subjects give him great Sums of
Money to come down to them again;
and yet they were &s;o fond of him, That
they always complyed with him, and
would give him every thing he askt, ra|ther
than to be without him: <HI>But they
grew wi&s;er &s;ince.</HI></P>
<P>At la&s;t, this Prince u&s;ed his Engine &s;o
long, it could hold together no longer;
and being obliged to write to his Subjects
to pick him out &s;ome new Feathers, <HI>they did
&s;o;</HI> but withall &s;ent him &s;uch <HI>&s;trong</HI> Fea|thers,
and &s;o <HI>&s;tiff,</HI> that when he had placed
<PB N="40" REF="42">
'em in their proper places, and made a very
beautiful Engine, it was <HI>too heavy for him
to manage:</HI> He made a great many E&s;&s;ays
at it, and had it placed on the top of an
old Idol Chappel, dedicated to an old
<HI>Bramyn</HI> Saint of tho&s;e Countries, called,
<HI>Phanto&s;teina&s;chap;</HI> in <HI>Latin, chap. de Saint
Stephano;</HI> or in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> St. <HI>Stephen</HI>'s:
Here the Prince try'd all po&s;&s;ible Contri|vances,
and a va&s;t deal of Money it co&s;t
him; but the Feathers were [<HI>&s;o &s;tiff</HI> they
would not work, and <HI>the Fire within</HI> was
&s;o choaked and &s;mother'd with its <HI>own
Smoak,</HI> for want of due Vent and Circu|lation,
that it <HI>would not burn;</HI> &s;o he was
oblig'd to take it down again; and from
thence he carried it to his College of <HI>Bra|myn</HI>
Prie&s;ts, and &s;et it up in one of their
Publick Buildings: There he drew Cir|cles
of Ethicks and Politicks, and fell to
ca&s;ting of Figures and Conjuring, but all
would not do, <HI>the Feathers</HI> could not be
brought to move; and, indeed, I have
ob&s;erv'd, That the&s;e Engines are &s;eldom
helpt by Art and Contrivance; there is
no way with them, but to have the Peo|ple
&s;poke to, to get <HI>good Feathers;</HI> and
they are ea&s;ily placed, and perform all
the &s;everal Motions with the greate&s;t Ea&s;e
<PB N="41" REF="43">
and Accuracy imaginable; <HI>but it must be
all Nature;</HI> any thing of Force di&s;torts
and di&s;locates them, and the whole
Order is &s;poiled; and if there be but one
Feather out of place, or pincht, or &s;tands
wrong, <HI>the D&mdash;l would not ride in the
Chariot.</HI></P>
<P>The Prince thus finding his Labour in
vain, broke the Engine to pieces, and
&s;ent his Subjects Word what bad Feathers
they had &s;ent him: But the People, who
knew it was his own want of Manage|ment,
and that the Feathers were good
enough, only a little &s;tiff at fir&s;t, and with
good U&s;age would have been brought to
be fit for u&s;e, took it ill, and never would
&s;end him any other as long as he liv'd:
However, it had this good effect upon
him, That he never made any more Voy|ages
to the <HI>Moon</HI> as long as he reign'd.</P>
<P>His Brother &s;uceeeded him; and truly
he was re&s;oved upon a Voyage to the
<HI>Moon,</HI> as &s;oon as ever he came to the
Crown. He had met with &s;ome unkind
U&s;age from the Religious <HI>Lune&s;&s;es</HI> of his
own Country; and be turn'd <HI>Abogratziarian,</HI>
a zealous fiery Sect &s;omething like our <HI>Anti-every
<PB N="42" REF="44">
body-arians</HI> in <HI>England.</HI> 'Tis confe&s;t,
&s;ome of the <HI>Bramyns</HI> of his Country were
very fal&s;e to him, put him upon &s;everal
Ways of extending his Power over his
Subjects, contrary to the Cu&s;toms of the
People, and contrary to his own Inte|re&s;t;
and when the People expre&s;&s;ed
their Di&s;like of it, he thought to have
been &s;upported by tho&s;e Clergy-men; but
they failed him, and made good that Old
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ver&s;e;</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>That Prie&s;ts of all Religions are the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>He took this &s;o hainou&s;ly, that he con|ceiv'd
a ju&s;t Hatred again&s;t tho&s;e that had
deceiv'd him; and as Re&s;entments &s;eldom
keep Rules, unhappily entertain'd Preju|dices
again&s;t all the re&s;t; and not finding
it ea&s;y to bring all his De&s;igns to pa&s;s
better, he re&s;olved upon a Voyage to the
<HI>Moon.</HI></P>
<P>Accordingly, he &s;ends a Summons to
all his People according to Cu&s;tom, to
collect the u&s;ual quantity of Feathers for
that purpo&s;e; and becau&s;e he would be
&s;ure not be u&s;ed as his Brother and Fa|ther
had been, he took care to &s;end cer|tain
<PB N="43" REF="45">
Cunning-men Expre&s;s, all over the
Country, to be&s;peak the People's Care,
in collecting, picking and culling them out,
the&s;e were call'd in their Language, <HI>T&s;o|pablesdetoo;</HI>
which being Tran&s;lated may
&s;ignify in <HI>Engli&s;h, Men of Zeal,</HI> or <HI>Booted
Apo&s;tles:</HI> Nor was this the only Caution
this Prince u&s;ed; for he took care, as the
Feathers were &s;ent up to him, to &s;earch
and examine them one by one in his own
Clo&s;et, to &s;ee if they were fit for his pur|po&s;e;
but, alas! he found him&s;elf in his
Brother's Ca&s;e exactly; and perceived,
That his Subjects were generally di&s;gu&s;ted
at his former Conduct, about <HI>Abrogratzi|ani&s;m,</HI>
and &s;uch things, and particu|larly
&s;et in a Flame by &s;ome of their
Prie&s;ts, call'd, <HI>Dullobardians,</HI> or <HI>Pa&s;&s;ive-Obedience-men,</HI>
who had lately turn'd their
Tale, and their Tail too upon their own
Princes; and upon this, be laid a&s;ide any
more Thoughts of the Engine, but took
up a de&s;perate and implacable Re&s;olution,
<HI>viz.</HI> to fly up to the Moon without it; in
order to this, abundance of his Cunning|men
were &s;ummon'd together to a&s;&s;i&s;t
him, &s;trange Engines contriv'd, and Me|thods
prpos'd; and a great many came
from all Parts, to furni&s;h him with In|ventions
<PB N="44" REF="46">
and equivalent for their Jour|ney;
but all were &s;o prepo&s;terous and ri|diculous
that his Subjects &s;eeing him going
on to ruin him&s;elf, and by Con&s;equence
them too, unanimou&s;ly took Arms; and
if their Prince had not made his E&s;cape
into a foreign Country, 'tis thought they
would have &s;ecur'd him <HI>for a Mad-man.</HI></P>
<P>And here 'tis ob&s;ervable, That as it is
in mo&s;t &s;uch Ca&s;es, the mad Councellors
of this Prince, when the People begun to$gather
about him, fleds; and every one
&s;hifted for them&s;elves; nay, and &s;ome
of them plunder'd him fir&s;t of his Jewels
and Trea&s;ure, and never were heard of$
&s;ince.</P>
<P>From this Prince none of the Kings o$
Government of that Country have ever
&s;eem'd to incline to the hazardous At|tempt
of the Voyage to the <HI>Moon,</HI> at lea&s;t
not in &s;uch a hair-brain'd manner.</P>
<P>However, the Engine has been very
accurately Re-built and fini&s;h'd; and the
People are now oblig'd by a Law, to &s;end
up new Feathers every three Years, to
prevent the Mi&s;chiefs which happen'd by
<PB N="45" REF="47">
that Prince afore&s;aid, keeping one Set &s;o
$ong that it was dangerous to venture
with them; and thus the Engine is pre|&s;erved
fit for u&s;e.</P>
<P>And yet has not this Engine been with|out
its continual Di&s;a&s;ters, and often out
of repair; for though the Kings of the
Country, as has been Noted, have done
riding on the back of it, yet the <HI>re&s;tle&s;s</HI>
Courtiers and Mini&s;ters of State have fre|quently
obtained the Management of it,
from the too ea&s;y Goodne&s;s of their Ma|&s;ters,
or the Evils of the Times.</P>
<P>To Cure this, the Princes frequently
chang'd Hands, turn'd one Set of Men out
and put another in: But this made things
&s;till wor&s;e; for it divided the People into
Parties and Factions in the State, and &s;till
the Strife was, who &s;hould ride in this
Engine; and no &s;ooner were the&s;e <HI>Skaet-Riders</HI>
got into it, but they were for <HI>dri|ving
all the Nation up to the</HI> Moon: But of
this by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>Authors differ concerning the Original
of the&s;e Feathers, and by what mo&s;t exact
Hand they were fir&s;t appointed to this
<PB N="46" REF="48">
particular u&s;e; and as their Original
hard to be found, &s;o it &s;eems a Difficulty
to re&s;olve from what &s;ort of Bird the&s;e
Feathers are obtained: Some have nam'd
one, &s;ome another; but the mo&s;t Learn|ed
in tho&s;e Climates call it by a hard
Word, which the Printer having no Let|ters
to expre&s;s, and being in that place
Hierogliphical, I can tran&s;late no better
than by the Name of a <HI>Collective:</HI> This
mu&s;t be a &s;trange Bird without doubt; it
has Heads, Claws, Eyes and Teeth innu|merable;
and if I &s;hould go about to de|&s;cribe
it to you, the Hi&s;tory would be &s;o
Romantick, it would &s;poil the Credit of
the&s;e more Authentick Relations which
are yet behind.</P>
<P>'Tis &s;ufficient, therefore, for the pre|&s;ent,
only to leave you this &s;hort Abridge|ment
of the Story, as follows: This great
Mon&s;trous Bird, call'd the <HI>Collective,</HI> is
very &s;eldom &s;een, and indeed never, but
upon <HI>Great Revolutions,</HI> and portending
terrible De&s;olations and De&s;tructions to
a Country.</P>
<P>But he frequently &s;heds his Feathers;
and they are carefully pickt up, by the
<PB N="47" REF="49">
<HI>Proprietors</HI> of tho&s;e Lands where they
fall; for <HI>none but tho&s;e Proprietors may</HI>
meddle with them; and they no &s;ooner
pick them up but they are &s;ent to Court,
where they obtain a new Name, and are
called in a Word equally difficult to pro|nounce
as the other, but very like our
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Word, <HI>Repre&s;entative;</HI> and being
placed in their proper Rows, with the
<HI>Great Feather</HI> in the Center, and fitted for
u&s;e, they lately obtained the Venerable
Title of, <HI>The Con&s;olidators;</HI> and the Ma|chine
it &s;elf, the <HI>Con&s;olidator;</HI> and by that
Name the Reader is de&s;ir'd for the future
to let it be dignified and di&s;tingui&s;h'd.</P>
<P>I cannot, however, forbear to de&s;cant a
little here, on the Dignity and Beauty
of the&s;e Feathers, being &s;uch as are hard|ly
to be &s;een in any part of the World,
but ju&s;t in the&s;e remote Climates.</P>
<P>And Fir&s;t, Every Feather has various
Colours, and according to the Variety of
the Weather, are apt to look brighter and
clearer, or paler and fainter, as the <HI>Sun</HI>
happens to look on them with a &s;tronger
or weaker A&s;pect. The Quill or Head of
every Feather is <HI>or ought to be</HI> full of a
<PB N="48" REF="50">
vigorous Sub&s;tance, which gives Spirit
and &s;upports the brightne&s;s and colour of
the Feather; and as this is more or le&s;s in
quantity, the bright Colour of the Feather
is increa&s;ed, or turns languid and pale.</P>
<P>'Tis true, &s;ome of tho&s;e Quills are ex|ceeding
empty and dry; and the Humid
being totally exhal'd, tho&s;e Feathers grow
very u&s;ele&s;s and in&s;ignificant in a &s;hort
time.</P>
<P>Some again are &s;o full of Wind, and
puft up with the Vapour of the Climate,
that there's not Humid enough to Con|dence
the Steam; and the&s;e are &s;o fleet
&s;o light, and &s;o continually fluttering and
trouble&s;ome, that they greatly &s;erve to
di&s;turb and keep the Motion un&s;teddy.</P>
<P>Others either placed too near the in|ward
concealed Fire, or the Head of the
Quill being thin, the Fire cau&s;es too
great a Fermentation; and the Con&s;e|quence
of this is &s;o fatal, that &s;ometimes
it mounts the Engine up too fa&s;t, and in|dangers
Precipitation: But 'tis happily
ob&s;erved, That the&s;e ill Feathers are but
a very few, compar'd to the whole num|ber;
<PB N="49" REF="51">
at the mo&s;t, I never heard they
were above 134 of the whole number:
As for the empty ones, they are not very
dangerous, but a &s;ort of <HI>Good-for-nothing
Feathers,</HI> that will fly when the greate&s;t
number of the re&s;t fly, or &s;tand &s;till when
they &s;tand &s;till. The fluttering hot-head|ed
Feathers ate the mo&s;t dangerous, and
frequently &s;truggle hard to mount the En|gine
to extravagant heights; but &s;till the
greater number of the Feathers being
&s;tanch, and well fixt, as well as well fur|ni&s;ht,
they always prevail, and check the
Di&s;orders the other would bring upon the
Motion; &s;o that upon the whole Matter,
tho' there has &s;ometims been oblique Mo|tions,
Variations, and &s;ometimes great
Wandrings out of the way, which may
make the Pa&s;&s;age tedious, yet it has always
been a certain and &s;afe Voyage; and no
Engine was ever known to mi&s;carry or
overthrow, but that one mentioned before,
and that was very much owing to the pre|cipitate
Methods the Prince took in gui|ding
it; and tho' all the fault was laid in
the Feathers, <HI>and they were to blame e|nough,</HI>
yet I never heard any Wi&s;e Man,
but what blam'd his Di&s;cretion, and par|ticularly,
a certain great Man has wrote
<PB N="50" REF="52">
three large Tracts of tho&s;e Affairs, and
call'd them, <HI>The Hi&s;tory of the Oppo&s;ition of the
Feathers;</HI> wherein, tho' it was expected
he would have cur&s;t the Engine it &s;elf
and all the Feathers to the Devil, on the
contrary, he lays equal blame on the
Prince, who guided the Chariot with &s;o
un&s;teddy a Hand, now as much too &s;lack,
as then too hard, turning them this way
and that &s;o ha&s;tily, that the Feathers could
not move in their proper order; and this
at la&s;t put the Fire in the Center quite
out, and &s;o the Engine over-&s;et at once.
This Impartiality has done great Ju&s;tice
to the Feathers, and &s;et things in a clearer
light: But of this I &s;hall &s;ay more, when
I come to treat of the <HI>Works of the Learn|ed</HI>
in this Lunar World.</P>
<P>This is hinted here only to inform the
Reader, That this Engine is the &s;afe&s;t
Pa&s;&s;age that ever was found out; and
that &s;aving that one time, it never mi&s;|carried;
nor if the common Order of
things be ob&s;erved, cannot Mi&s;carry; for
the good Feathers are always <HI>Negatives</HI>
when any precipitant Motion is felt, and
immediately &s;uppre&s;s it by their number;
and the&s;e <HI>Negative Feathers</HI> are indeed the
<PB N="51" REF="53">
Travellers &s;afety; the other are always
upon the flutter, and upon every occa&s;ion
<HI>hey for the Moon,</HI> up in the Clouds pre|&s;ently;
but the&s;e <HI>Negative Feathers</HI> are
never for going up, but when there is
occa&s;ion for it; and from hence the&s;e
fluttering fermented Feathers were called
by the Antients <HI>High-flying Feathers,</HI> and
the blu&s;tering things &s;eem'd proud of the
Name.</P>
<P>But to come to their general Character,
the Feathers, &s;peaking of them all toge|ther,
are generally very Comely, Strong,
Large, Beautiful things, their Quills or
Heads well fixt, and the Cavities fill'd
with a &s;olid &s;ub&s;tantial Matter, which
tho' it is full of Spirit, has a great deal of
Temperament, and full of &s;uitable well-di&s;pos'd
Powers, to the Operation for
which they are de&s;ign'd.</P>
<P>The&s;e placed, as I Noted before, in an
extended Form like two great Wings, and
operated by that &s;ublime Flame; which
being concealed in proper Receptacles,
obtains its vent at the Cavities appointed,
are &s;upplied from thence with Life and
Motion; and as Fire it &s;elf, in the Opi|nion
<PB N="52" REF="54">
of &s;ome Learned Men, is nothing but
Motion, and Motion tends to Fire: It
can no more be a Wonder, if exalted in
the Center of this famous Engine, a whole
Nation &s;hould be carried up to the World
in the <HI>Moon.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis true, this Engine is frequently a&s;|&s;aulted
with fierce Winds, and furious
Storms, which &s;ometimes drive it a great
way out of its way; and indeed, con&s;i|dering
the length of the Pa&s;&s;age, and the
various Regions it goes through, it would
be &s;trange if it &s;hould meet with no Ob|&s;tructions:
The&s;e are oblique Gales, and
cannot be &s;aid to blow from any of the
Thirty-two Points, bnt Retrograde and
Thwart: Some of the&s;e are call'd in their
Language, <HI>Pen&s;ionazima,</HI> which is as much
as to &s;ay, being Interpreted, a <HI>Court-breeze;</HI>
another &s;ort of Wind, which generally
blows directly contrary to the <HI>Pen&s;ionazi|ma,</HI>
is the <HI>Clamorio,</HI> or in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> a <HI>Coun|try
Gale;</HI> this is generally Tempe&s;tuous,
full of Gu&s;ts and Di&s;gu&s;ts, Squauls and
&s;udden Bla&s;ts, not without claps of Thun|der,
and not a little fla&s;hing of Heat and
Party-fires.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="55">
There are a great many other Internal
Bla&s;ts, which proceed from the Fire with|in,
which &s;ometimes not circulating right,
breaks out in little Gu&s;ts of Wind and
Heat, and is apt to indanger &s;etting
Fire to the Feathers, and this is more
or le&s;s dangerous, according as among
which of the Feathers it happens; for
&s;ome of the Feathers are more apt to take
Fire than others, as their Quills or Heads
are more or le&s;s full of that &s;olid Matter
mention'd before.</P>
<P>The Engine &s;uffers frequent Convul&s;i|ons
and Di&s;orders from the&s;e &s;everal
Winds; and which if they chance to
overblow very much, hinder the Pa&s;&s;age;
but the Negative Feathers always apply
Temper and Moderation; and this brings
all to rights again.</P>
<P>For a Body like this, what can it not
do? what cannot &s;uch an Exten&s;ion per|form
in the Air? And when one thing is
tackt to another, and properly <HI>Co&s;olidated</HI>
into one mighty <HI>Con&s;olidator,</HI> no que&s;tion
but whoever &s;hall go up to the <HI>Moon,</HI> will
find him&s;elf &s;o improv'd in this wonder|ful
<PB N="54" REF="56">
Experiment, that not a Man ever per|form'd
that wonderful Flight, but he cer|tainly

<P>Well, Gentlemen, and what if we are
call'd <HI>High-flyers</HI> now, and an Hundred
Names of Contempt and Di&s;tinction,
what is this to the purpo&s;e? who would
not be a <HI>High-flyer,</HI> to be Tackt and <HI>Con|&s;olidated</HI>
in an Engine of &s;uch &s;ublime
Elevation, and which lifts Men, Monarchs,
Members, yea, and whole Nations, up
into the Clouds; and performs with &s;uch
wondrous Art, the long expected Experi|ment
of a Voyage to the <HI>Moon?</HI> And
thus much for the De&s;cription of the <HI>Con|&s;olidator.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t Voyage I ever made to this
Country, was in one of the&s;e Engines;
and I can &s;afely affirm, I never wak'd all
the way; and now having been as often
there as mo&s;t that have us'd that Trade,
it may be expected I &s;hould give &s;ome
Account of the Country; for it appears&punc;
I can give but little of the Road.</P>
<P>Only this I under&s;tand, That when this
Engine, by help of the&s;e Artificial Wings
has rai&s;ed it &s;elf up to a certain height
<PB N="55" REF="57">
the Wings are as u&s;eful to keep it from
falling into the <HI>Moon,</HI> as they were before
to rai&s;e it, and keep it from falling back
into this Region again.</P>
<P>This may happen from an Alteration of
Centers, and Gravity having pa&s;t a cer|tain
Line, the Equipoi&s;e changes its Ten|dency,
the Magnetick Quality being be|yond
it, it inclines of Cour&s;e, and pur|&s;ues
a Center, which it finds in the <HI>Lunar
World,</HI> and lands us &s;afe upon the Sur|face.</P>
<P>I was told, I need take no Bills of Ex|change
with me, nor Letters of Credit;
for that upon my fir&s;t Arrival, the Inha|bitants
would be very civil to me: That
they never &s;uffered any of <HI>Our World</HI> to
want any thing when they came there:
That they were very free to &s;how them
any thing, and inform them in all need|ful
Ca&s;es; and that whatever Rarities the
Country afforded, &s;hould be expos'd im|mediately.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not enter into the Cu&s;toms, Geo|graphy,
or Hi&s;tory of the Place, only
acquaint the Reader, That I found no
<PB N="56" REF="58">
manner of Difference in any thing Natu|ral,
except as hereafter excepted, but all
was exactly as is here, an Elementary
World, peopled with Folks, <HI>as like us as</HI>
if they were only Inhabitants of the &s;ame
Continent, but in a remote Climate.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants were <HI>Men, Women,
Bea&s;ts, Birds, Fi&s;hes,</HI> and <HI>In&s;ects,</HI> of the
&s;ame individual Species as Ours, the lat|ter
excepted: The <HI>Men</HI> no wi&s;er, better,
nor bigger than here; the <HI>Women</HI> no
hand&s;omer or hone&s;ter than Ours: There
were Knaves and hone&s;t Men, hone&s;t Wo|men
and Whores of all Sorts, Countries,
Nations and Kindreds, as on this &s;ide the
Skies.</P>
<P>They had the &s;ame Sun to &s;hine, the
Planets were equally vi&s;ible <HI>as to us,</HI> and
<HI>their A&s;trologers</HI> were as bu&s;ily Impertinent
as Ours, only that tho&s;e wonderful Gla&s;|&s;es
hinted before made &s;trange Di&s;cove|ries
that we were unacquainted with; by
them they could, plainly di&s;cover, That
<HI>this</HI> World was <HI>their</HI> Moon, and <HI>their</HI>
World <HI>our</HI> Moon; and when I came fir&s;t
among them, the People that flockt about
me, di&s;tingui&s;ht me by the Name of, <HI>the
Man that came out of the Moon.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="59">
I cannot, however, but acquaint the
Reader, with &s;ome Remarks I made in
this new World, before I come to any
thing Hi&s;torical.</P>
<P>I have heard, that among the General|lity
of our People, who being not much
addicted to Revelation, have much con|cern'd
them&s;elves about Demon&s;trations,
a Generation have ri&s;en up, who to &s;olve
the Difficulties of Supernatural Sy&s;tems,
imagine <HI>a mighty va&s;t Something,</HI> who has
$o Form but what repre&s;ents him to them
as one <HI>Great Eye:</HI> This infinite Optick
they imagine to be <HI>Natura Naturans,</HI> or
Power-forming; and that as we pretend
the Soul of Man has a Similitude in quali|ty
to its Original, according to a Notion
&s;ome People have, who read that &s;o much
$idicul'd Old Legend, call'd <HI>Bible,</HI> That
<HI>Man was made in the Image of his Maker:</HI>
The Soul of Man, therefore, in the Opi|nion
of the&s;e Naturalli&s;ts, is <HI>one va&s;t Op|tick
Power</HI> diffus'd through him into all
his Parts, but &s;eated principally in his
Head.</P>
<P>From hence they re&s;olve all Beings to
<HI>Eyes,</HI> &s;ome more capable of Sight and re|ceptive
<PB N="58" REF="60">
of Objects than others; and as to
things Invi&s;ible, they reckon nothing &s;o,
only &s;o far as our Sight is deficient, con|tracted
or darkened by Accidents from
without, as Di&s;tance of Place, Interpo&s;i|tion
of Vapours, Clouds, liquid Air, Ex|halations,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> or from within, <HI>as wan|dring
Errors, wild Notions, cloudy &V;nder|&s;tandings,</HI>
and <HI>empty Fancies,</HI> with a Thou|&s;and
other interpo&s;ing Ob&s;tacles to the
Sight, which darken it, and prevent its
Operation; and particularly ob&s;truct the
perceptive Faculties, weaken the Head,
and bring Mankind in General to &s;tand in
need of the <HI>Spectacles of Education</HI> as &s;oon
ever they are born: Nay, and as &s;oon
as they have made u&s;e of the&s;e Artificial
Eyes, all they can do is but to clear the
Sight &s;o far as <HI>to &s;ee</HI> that <HI>they can't &s;ee;</HI> the
utmo&s;t Wi&s;dom of Mankind, and the
highe&s;t Improvement a Man ought to wi&s;h
for, being but to be able to &s;ee that <HI>he was
Born blind;</HI> this pu&s;hes him upon &s;earch
after Mediums for the Recovery of his
Sight, and <HI>away he runs to School</HI> to Art
and Science, and there he is furni&s;ht with
<HI>Hoco&s;copes, Micro&s;copes, Telle&s;copes, Caeli&s;|copes,
Money-&s;copes,</HI> and the D&mdash;l and
and all of Gla&s;&s;es, to help and a&s;&s;i&s;t his
<PB N="59" REF="61">
<HI>Moon-blind &V;nder&s;tanding;</HI> the&s;e with
wonderful Skill and Ages of Application,
after wandring thro' Bogs and Wilderne&s;|&s;es
of <HI>Gue&s;s, Conjectures, Suppo&s;es, Calcu|lations,</HI>
and he knows riot what, which he
meets with in <HI>Phy&s;icks, Politicks, Ethicks,
A&s;tronomy, Malthematicks,</HI> and &s;uch &s;ort
of bewildring Things, bring him with
va&s;t Difficulty to a little Minute-&s;pot,
call'd <HI>Demon&s;tration;</HI> and as not one in
Ten Thou&s;and ever finds the way thither,
but are lo&s;t in the tire&s;ome uncouth Jour|ney,
&s;a they <HI>that do,</HI> 'tis &s;o long before
they come there, that they are grown
Old and good for little in the Journey;
and no &s;ooner have they obtained a gli|mering
of this Univer&s;al <HI>Eye-&s;ight,</HI> this
<HI>Eclarici&s;sment General,</HI> but they <HI>Die,</HI> and
have hardly time to &s;how the way to
tho&s;e that come after.</P>
<P>Now, as the earne&s;t &s;earch after this
thing call'd <HI>Demon&s;tration</HI> fill'd me with
De&s;ires of &s;eeing every thing, &s;o my Ob|&s;ervations
of the &s;trange multitude of My&s;|teries
I met with in all Men's Actions here,
&s;purr'd my Curio&s;ity to examine, if <HI>the
Great Eye</HI> of the World had no People to
whom he had given a clearer Eye-&s;ight,
<PB N="60" REF="62">
or at lea&s;t, that made a better u&s;e of it
than we had here.</P>
<P>If pur&s;uing this &s;earch I was much de|lighted
at my Arrival into <HI>China,</HI> it can|not
be thought &s;trange, &s;ince there we
find Knowledge as much advanc'd beyond
our common Pitch, as it was pretended
to be deriv'd from a more Ancient Ori|ginal.</P>
<P>We are told, that in the early Age of
the World, the Strength of Invention ex|ceded
all that ever has been arrived to
&s;ince: That we in the&s;e latter Ages, ha|ving
lo&s;t all that pri&s;tine Strength of Rea|&s;on
and Invention, which died with the
Ancients in the Flood, and receiving no
helps from that Age, have by long Search
arriv'd at &s;everal remote Parts of Know|ledge,
by the helps of reading Conver&s;a|tion
and Experience; but that all amounts
to no more than faint Imitations, Apings,
and Re&s;emblances of what was known in
tho&s;e ma&s;terly Ages.</P>
<P>Now, if it be true as is hinted before,
That the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Empire was Peopled long
before the Flood; and that they were
<PB N="61" REF="63">
not de&s;troyed in the General Deluge in
the Days of <HI>Noah;</HI> 'tis no &s;uch &s;trange
thing, that they &s;hould &s;o much out-do us
in this &s;ort of <HI>Eye-&s;ight</HI> we call <HI>General
Knowledge,</HI> &s;ince the Perfections be&s;tow'd
on Nature, when in her Youth and Prime
met with no General Suffocation by that
Calamity.</P>
<P>But if I was extreamly delighted with
the extraordinary things I &s;aw in tho&s;e
Countries, you cannot but imagine I was
exceedingly mov'd, when I heard of a
<HI>Lunar</HI> World; and that the way was
$a&s;&s;able from the&s;e Parts.</P>
<P>I had heard of a <HI>World in the moon</HI>
among &s;ome of our Learned Philo&s;ophers,
and <HI>Moor,</HI> as I have been told, had <HI>a Moon</HI>
$n his Head; but none of the fine Preten|$ers,
no not Bi&s;hop <HI>Wilkins,</HI> ever found
Mechanick Engines, who&s;e Motion was
&s;ufficient to attempt the Pa&s;&s;age. A late
$appy Author indeed, among his Mecha|nick
Operations of the Spirit, had found
$ut an Enthu&s;ia&s;m, which if he could have
$ur&s;ued to its proper Extream, without
$oubt might, <HI>either in the Body or out of
$$e Body,</HI> have Landed him &s;omewhere
<PB N="62" REF="64">
hereabout; but that he form'd his Sy&s;tem
wholly upon the mi&s;taken Notion of <HI>Wind,</HI>
which Learned Hypothe&s;is being directly
contrary to the Nature of things in this
Climate, where the <HI>Ela&s;ticity</HI> of the Air
is quite different, and where the <HI>pre&s;&s;ure
of the Atmo&s;phere</HI> has for want of Vapour
no Force, all his Notion di&s;&s;olv'd in its
Native Vapour call'd <HI>Wind,</HI> and flew up|ward
in blew Strakes of a livid Flame
call'd <HI>Bla&s;phemy,</HI> which burnt up all the
Wit and Fancy of the Author, and left a
&s;trange <HI>&s;tench</HI> behind it, that has this un|happy
quality in it, that every Body that
Reads the Book, <HI>&s;mells the Auther,</HI> tho'
he be never &s;o far off; nay, tho' he took
Shipping to <HI>Dublin,</HI> to &s;ecure his Friends
from the lea&s;t danger of a Conjecture.</P>
<P>But to return to the happy Regions of
the <HI>Lunar Continent,</HI> I was no &s;ooner
Landed there, and had lookt about me,
but I was &s;urpriz'd with the &s;trange Alte|ration
of the Climate and Country; and
particularly a &s;trange Salubrity and Fra|grancy
in the Air, which I felt &s;o Nou|ri&s;hing,
&s;o Plea&s;ant and Delightful, that
tho' I could perceive &s;ome &s;mall Re&s;pira|tion,
it was hardly di&s;cernable, and the
<PB N="63" REF="65">
lea&s;t requi&s;ite for Life, &s;upplied &s;o long
that the Bellows of Nature were hardly
imployed.</P>
<P>But as I &s;hall take occa&s;ion to con&s;ider
this in a Critical Examination into the
Nature, U&s;es and Advantages of <HI>Good
Lungs,</HI> of which by it &s;elf, &s;o I think fit
to confine my pre&s;ent Ob&s;ervations to
things more particularly concerning the
<HI>Eye-&s;ight.</HI></P>
<P>I was, you may be &s;ure, not a little
&s;urprized, when being upon an Eminence
I found my &s;elf capable by common Ob|&s;ervation,
to &s;ee and di&s;tingui&s;h things at
the di&s;tance of 100 Miles and more, and
&s;eeking &s;ome Information on this point,
I was acquainted by the People, that
there was <HI>a certain grave Philo&s;opher</HI> hard
by, that could give me a very good Ac|count
of things.</P>
<P>It is not worth while to tell you this
Man's <HI>Lunar Name,</HI> or whether he had a
Name, or no; 'tis plain, 'twas a <HI>Man in
the Moon;</HI> but all the Conference I had
with him was very &s;trange: At my fir&s;t
coming to him, he askt me if I came from
<PB N="64" REF="66">
the <HI>World in the Moon?</HI> I told him, <HI>no:</HI>
At which he began to be angry, told me
<HI>I Ly'd,</HI> he knew whence I came as well
as I did; for he &s;aw me all the way. I
told him, I came <HI>to the World in the Moon,</HI>
and began to be as &s;urly as he. It was a
long time before we could agree about it,
he would have it, that I came down from
<HI>the Moon;</HI> and I, that I came <HI>up to the
Moon:</HI> From this, we came to Explica|tions,
Demon&s;trations, Spheres, Globes,
Regions, Atmo&s;pheres, and a Thou&s;and
odd Diagrams, to make the thing out to
one another. I in&s;i&s;ted on my part, as
that my Experiment qualified me to know,
and challeng'd him to <HI>go back with me</HI> to
prove it. He, like a true Philo&s;opher,
rai&s;ed a Thou&s;and Scruples, Conjectures,
and Spherical Problems, to Confront me;
and as for Demon&s;trations, he call'd 'em
Fancies of my own. Thus we differ'd a
great many ways; both of us were cer|tain,
and both uncertain; both right,
and yet both directly contrary; how to
reconcile this Jangle was very hard, till
at la&s;t this Demon&s;tration happen'd, the
Moon as he call'd it, turning her blind|&s;ide
upon us three Days after the Change,
by which, with the help of his extraor|dinary
<PB N="65" REF="67">
Gla&s;&s;es, I that knew the Country,
perceived that &s;ide the <HI>Sun</HI> lookt upon was
<HI>all Moon,</HI> and the other was <HI>all World;</HI>
and either I fancy'd I &s;aw or el&s;e really
&s;aw all the lofty Towers of the Immen&s;e
Cities of <HI>China:</HI> Upon this, and a little
more Debate, we came to this Conclu&s;i|on,
and there the Old Man and I agreed,
That they were <HI>both Moons</HI> and <HI>both Worlds,</HI>
this <HI>a Moon</HI> to that, and that <HI>a Moon</HI> to
this, like the Sun between two Looking-Gla&s;&s;es,
and &s;hone upon one another by
Reflection, according to the oblique or
direct Po&s;ition of each other.</P>
<P>This afforded us a great deal of Plea|&s;ure;
for all the World covet to be found
in the right, and are pleas'd when their
Notions are acknowledg'd by their Anta|goni&s;ts:
It al&s;o afforded us many very
u&s;eful Speculations, &s;uch as the&s;e;</P>

<P>I take upon me, therefore, to a&s;&s;ure
my Reader, That whoever plea&s;es to

will no &s;ooner look into the&s;e Explicating

<PB N="87" REF="89">
Life, Motion, Death,</HI> and a Thou&s;and
things that <HI>Wi&s;e-men</HI> puzzle them&s;elves

<P>Here too I find Gla&s;&s;es for the <HI>Second

<HI>Second Sight</HI> has been often pretended to
in <HI>Our Regions,</HI> and &s;ome Famous Old
Wives have told us, they can &s;ee <HI>Death,</HI>
the <HI>Soul, Futurity,</HI> and the Neighbour|hood
of them, in the Countenance: By

<P>But all this Gue&s;s and Uncertainty is a

<HI>His time was not yet come.</HI> The&s;e ab&s;tru&s;e

here; and the&s;e People are &s;uch
<HI>Hereticks,</HI> that they &s;ay <HI>God's Decrees</HI> are
all &s;ub&s;ervient to the means of his <HI>Provi|dence;</HI>
That what we call Providence is
a &s;ubjecting all things to the great <HI>Chain
of Cau&s;es and Con&s;equences,</HI> by which that
one Grand Decree, That all Effects &s;hall
Obey, without re&s;erve to their proper
moving Cau&s;es, &s;upercedes all <HI>&s;ub&s;equent
Doctrines,</HI> or pretended Decrees, or Pre|de&s;tination
in the World: That by this

Die,</HI> any Decrees, Prede&s;tination, or
Fore-Knowledge of Infinite Powder, <HI>to the

<P>All the&s;e things are <HI>received Truths</HI> here,
and no doubt would be &s;o every where el&s;e,
if the Eyes of Rea&s;on were open'd to the
Te&s;timony of Nature, or if they had the

<P>Some pretended, by the help of the&s;e
<HI>Second-&s;ight Gla&s;&s;es,</HI> to &s;ee the common

could &s;ee a great way beyond <HI>the leap in

<Q><L>The Verge of Life and Death is here.</L>
<L>'Tis best to know where 'tis, but not how far.</L></Q></P>
<P>As to &s;eeing <HI>beyond Death,</HI> all the Gla&s;|&s;es
I lookt into for that purpo&s;e, <HI>made
but little of it;</HI> and the&s;e were the only

could di&s;cern nothing but Clouds, Mi&s;ts,

in my Mind, that I had read a

Conclu&s;ion of it, to all &s;uch as gave them|&s;elves

<HI>Look up;</HI> upon which, turning one

in large Capital Letters.</P>
<P>I had like to have rais'd the Mob upon
me for looking <HI>upright</HI> with this Gla&s;s;
for this, they &s;aid, was prying into the
My&s;teries of the Great <HI>Eye</HI> of the World;
That we ought to enquire no farther than
he has inform'd us, and <HI>to believe</HI> what
he had left us <HI>more Ob&s;cure:</HI> Upon this,
I laid down the Gla&s;&s;es, and concluded,
that we had <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and the <HI>Prophets,</HI> and
&s;hould be never the likelier to be taught
by <HI>One come from the</HI> Moon.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I found, indeed, they had a
great deal more Knowledge of things than
we in this World; and that <HI>Nature, Sci|ence,</HI>
<PB N="91" REF="93">
and <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> had obtained great Im|provements
in the <HI>Lunar World;</HI> but as

&s;o I &s;hall give the World no
great Information of the&s;e things.</P>
<P>I come next to &s;ome other &s;trange Ac|quirements
obtained by the helps of the&s;e
Gla&s;&s;es; and particularly for the di&s;cern|ing
the <HI>Imperceptibles</HI> of Nature; &s;uch as,
the <HI>Soul, Thought, Hone&s;ty, Religion, Vir|ginity,</HI>
and an Hundred other nice things,
too &s;mall for humane Di&s;cerning.</P>
<P>The Di&s;coveries made by the&s;e Gla&s;&s;es,

Variety; &s;ome <HI>Hieroglyphical,</HI> and <HI>Em|blematical,</HI>
and &s;ome Demon&s;trative.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hieroglyphical</HI> Di&s;coveries of the
Soul make it appear in the <HI>Image of its
Maker;</HI> and the Analogy is remarkable,
even in the very <HI>Simily;</HI> for as they re|pre&s;ent
the Original of Nature as <HI>One
Great Eye,</HI> illuminating as well as di&s;cern|ing
all things; &s;o the <HI>Soul,</HI> in its <HI>Allego|rical,</HI>
or <HI>Hieroglyphical</HI> Re&s;emblance, ap|pears
<PB N="92" REF="94">
as a <HI>Great Eye,</HI> embracing the Man,
enveloping, operating, and informing eve|ry
Part; <HI>from whence</HI> tho&s;e fort of Peo|ple
who we fal&s;ly call <HI>Politicians,</HI> affect|ing
&s;o much to put out <HI>this Great Eye,</HI> by
acting again&s;t their common Under&s;tand|ings,

Eye, with Six or Seven pair of Spectacles on;</HI>
not but that the Eye of their Souls may
be clear enough of it &s;elf, as to the com|mon
Under&s;tanding; but that they hap|pen
to have occa&s;ion to look &s;ometimes
<HI>&s;o many ways at once,</HI> and to judge, con|clude,
and under&s;tand <HI>&s;o many contrary
ways</HI> upon one and the &s;ame thing; that
they are fain to put double Gla&s;&s;es upon
their Under&s;tanding, as we look at the
<HI>Solar Ecclip&s;es,</HI> to repre&s;ent 'em in <HI>different
Lights,</HI> lea&s;t <HI>their Judgments</HI> &s;hould not
<HI>be wheadled</HI> into a Compliance with the
<HI>Helli&s;h Re&s;olutions of their Wills;</HI> and this
is what I call the Emblematick Repre&s;en|tation
of the Soul.</P>
<P>As for the Demon&s;trations of the <HI>Soul's

heard of Chyrurgeons, that could read
<PB N="93" REF="95">
an Anatomical Lecture on the Parts of

<P>But they very aptly &s;how it, like a

the Body,</HI> &s;uffers a Depredation, or an
Inva&s;ion of the Enemy, the Expre&s;&s;es fly
to the Seat of the Soul, <HI>the Brain,</HI> and
immediately are order'd back <HI>to &s;mart,</HI>

World</HI> from the World in the <HI>Moon.</HI></P>
<P>As the Being, Nature, and Scituation
Of <HI>humane Soul</HI> is thus <HI>Spherically</HI> and <HI>Ma|thematically</HI>
di&s;cover'd, I could not find
any Second Thoughts about it in all their
Books, whether of their own Compo&s;ition
or by Tran&s;lation; for it was a General
received Notion, That there could not
be a greater Ab&s;urdity in humane Know|ledge,
than to imploy the Thoughts in
Que&s;tioning, what is as plainly known
by its Con&s;equences, as if &s;een with <HI>the
Eye;</HI> and that to doubt the Being or Ex|tent
of the Soul's Operation, is to <HI>imploy
her again&s;t her &s;elf;</HI> and therefore, when
I began to argue with my Old Philo&s;o|pher,
again&s;t the Materiality and Immor|tality
of this My&s;tery we call <HI>Soul, he
laught at me,</HI> and told me, he found we
had none of their Gla&s;&s;es in our World;
<PB N="95" REF="97">
and bid me &s;end all our <HI>Scepticks, Soul-Sleepers,</HI>
our <HI>Cowards, Bakers, Kings</HI> and
<HI>Bakewells,</HI> up to him into the <HI>Moon,</HI> if
they wanted Demon&s;trations; where, by
the help of their Engines, they would
make it plain to them, that the <HI>Great Eye</HI>
being one va&s;t Intellect, <HI>Infinite</HI> and <HI>Eter|nal,</HI>
all <HI>Inferior Life</HI> is a Degree of <HI>him&s;elf,</HI>
and as exactly repre&s;ents him as one little
<HI>Flame</HI> the whole Ma&s;s of <HI>Fire;</HI> That it is
therefore uncapable of Di&s;&s;olution, being
like its Original in Duration, as well as in
its Powers and Faculties, but that it goes
and returns by <HI>Emi&s;&s;ion, Regre&s;&s;ion,</HI> as the
<HI>Great Eye</HI> governs and determines; and
this was plainly made out, by the Figure
I had &s;een it in, <HI>viz.</HI> an <HI>Eye,</HI> the exact
Image of its Maker: 'Tis true, <HI>it was dark|ned</HI>
by Ignorance, Folly and Crime, and
therefore oblig'd <HI>to wear Spectacles;</HI> but
tho' the&s;e were Defects or Interruptions in
its Operation, they were none in its Na|ture;
which as it had its immediate Ef|flux
from <HI>the Great Eye,</HI> and its return to
him mu&s;t partake of him&s;elf, and could
not hut be of a Quality <HI>uncomatable,</HI> by
Ca&s;ualty or Death.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="98">
From this Di&s;cour&s;e we the more wil|lingly
adjourned our pre&s;ent Thoughts, <HI>I
being clearly convinced of the Matter;</HI> and
as for our Learned Doctors, with their
Second and Third <HI>Thoughts,</HI> I told him I
would recommend them <HI>to the Man in the</HI>
Moon for their farther Illumination, which
if they refu&s;e to accept, it was but ju&s;t
they &s;hould remain <HI>in a Wood,</HI> where <HI>they

<P>However, I cannot pa&s;s over a very
&s;trange and extraordinary piece of Art

This Engine is wholly applied to

<HI>Fancy,</HI> or Imagination, which by the heat

heighth, and is thus brought to &s;ee back|ward

&s;elf: By this a Man fancies him&s;elf <HI>in the
Moon,</HI> and realizes things there as di&s;tinct|ly,
as if he was actually talking to <HI>my Old
Phylo&s;opher.</HI></P>
<P>This indeed is an admirable Engine,
'tis compos'd of <HI>an Hundred Thou&s;and</HI> ra|tional
Con&s;equences, <HI>Five times the num|ber</HI>
of Conjectures, Suppo&s;es, and Proba|bilities,
be&s;ides an innumerable Company
of fluttering Sugge&s;tions, and Injections,
which hover round the Imagination and
are all taken in as fa&s;t as they can be Con|cocted
and Dige&s;ted there: The&s;e are
form'd into Ideas, and &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;o
well put together, &s;o exactly &s;hap'd, &s;o
well dre&s;t and &s;et out by the Additional
Fire of Fancy, that it is no uncommon

his own Begetting,</HI> nor be able to di&s;tin|gui&s;h
between Reality and Repre&s;enta|tion:
<PB N="112" REF="114">
From hence we have &s;ome People
talking to Images of their own forming;

whether he had an E&s;tate in

him the Cau&s;e of that enquiry, he re|ply'd,
there was one thing in the Na|ture
of his Country-men which &s;ecur'd
them from the ruin which u&s;ually at|tended
<HI>divided Nations, viz.</HI> that if any
Foreign Nation thinking to take the ad|vantage
of their Inte&s;tine Divi&s;ions <HI>fell
upon them</HI> in the highe&s;t of all their
Feuds, they'd lay a&s;ide their Parties and
Quarrels and pre&s;ently <HI>fall in together</HI> to
beat out the common Enemy; and then
no &s;ooner had they obtain'd <HI>Peace abroad,</HI>
by their Conduct and Bravery, but they
would fall to cutting one anothers
Throats again at home <HI>as naturally</HI> as if
it had been their proper Calling, and
that for Trifles too, <HI>meer Trifles.</HI></P>
<P>Very well, &s;aid I to <HI>my learned Self,</HI>

vulgarly call'd <HI>Religion.</HI></P>
<P>This Difference, as in its Original
it was not great, nor indeed upon Points
accounted among them&s;elves E&s;&s;ential,
&s;o it had never been a Difference of any
height, if there had not always been &s;ome
one thing, or other, hapning in the State
which made the Court-Polititians think
it nece&s;&s;ary to keep the People bu&s;y and
embroil'd, to prevent their more nar|row
In&s;pection into Depredations and
Encroachments on their Liberties, which
was always making on them by the

'Tis not deny'd but there might be a

pa&s;s for a certain Proof, that the State

<P>This premis'd, I am to tell the Read|er

their own Conque&s;ts by their inte&s;t|ine
Broils, they being as is already not|ed
a mo&s;t Eternally Quarrelling Nation;
upon this new Breach, they that fir&s;t
began the War, turn'd about, and plead|ing
that they took up Arms to regulate
the Government, not to overthrow it,
fell in with the Family of their Kings,
who had been bani&s;h'd, <HI>and one of
them de&s;troy'd,</HI> and re&s;tor'd the Crown
to the Family, and the Nation to the
Crown, ju&s;t <HI>for all the World</HI> as the <HI>Pre&s;|byterians</HI>
<PB N="125" REF="129">
in <HI>England</HI> did, in the Ca&s;e of
King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second.</P>
<P>The Party that was thus re&s;tor'd,
accepted the return the others made
to their Duty, and their A&s;&s;i&s;tance in
re&s;toring the Family of their Monarch,
but abated not a Tittle of the old Ran|cour
again&s;t them <HI>as a Party</HI> which they
entertain'd at their fir&s;t taking Arms,
not allowing the return they had made
to be <HI>any attonement at all</HI> for the Crimes
they had been guilty of before. 'Tis
true they pa&s;s'd an Act or Grant of <HI>General
Pardon,</HI> and Oblivion, as in all
&s;uch Ca&s;es is u&s;ual, and as without which
the other would never ha' come in, or
have join'd Powers to form the Re&s;to|ration
they were bringing to pa&s;s, but
the old Feud of Religion continu'd with
this addition, that the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> were <HI>Re|bels,
Murtherers, King-killers,</HI> Enemies to
<HI>Monarchy</HI> and Civil Government, lovers
of Confu&s;ion, popular, anarchial Go|vernments,
and movers of Sedition;
that this was in their very <HI>Nature</HI> and
<HI>Principles,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="130">
In this Condition, and under the&s;e
Mortifications this Party of People liv'd
ju&s;t an <HI>Egyptian</HI> Servitude, <HI>viz.</HI> of 40
Years, in which time they were fre|quently
vex'd with Per&s;ecution, <HI>Ha|ra&s;s'd,</HI>
Plunder'd, <HI>Fin'd,</HI> Impri&s;oned, and
very hardly Treated, in&s;omuch that they
pretend to be able to give an account
of va&s;t Sums of their Country-Mony,
levy'd upon them on the&s;e Occa&s;ions,
amounting as I take it to 2 Millions of
<HI>Lunatians,</HI> a Coin they keep their Ac|counts
by there, and much about the
value of our Pound Sterling; be&s;ides
this they were hook't into a great ma|ny
Sham Plots, and Sworn out of their
<HI>Lives</HI> and <HI>E&s;tates</HI> in &s;uch a manner, that
in the very next Reign the Government
was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of their hard treatment,
that they revers'd &s;everal Sentences by
the &s;ame Authority that had Executed
them; a mo&s;t undeniable Proof they
were a&s;ham'd of what had been done;
at la&s;t, the Prince who was re&s;tor'd as
above&s;aid, dyed, and his Brother mount|ed
the Throne; and now began <HI>a third
Scene</HI> of Affairs, for this Prince was
neither <HI>Church-man,</HI> nor <HI>Di&s;&s;enter,</HI> but
of a different Religion from them all
<PB N="127" REF="131">
known in that Country by the Name of
<HI>Abrogratziani&s;m,</HI> and this Religion of his
had this one ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;e|quence
in it, that a Man could not be
&s;incerely and heartily of this, but he mu&s;t
be an Implacable hater of both the o|ther.
As this is laid down as a previ|ous
Suppo&s;ition, we are with the &s;ame
Rea&s;on to imagine this Prince to be en|tirely
bent upon the Suppre&s;&s;ion and
De&s;truction of both the other, if not
<HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> as to Life and E&s;tate, yet <HI>en|tirely</HI>
as to Religion.</P>
<P>To bring this the more readily to pa&s;s
like a true Polititian, had his Methods
and Particulars been equally Politick
with his Generals, he began at the right
End, <HI>viz.</HI> to make the Breach between
the <HI>Solunnarian Church,</HI> and the <HI>Crolian
Di&s;&s;enters as wide as po&s;&s;ible,</HI> and to do
this it was re&s;olv'd to &s;hift Sides, and
as the Crown had always took part
with the Church, cru&s;h'd, humbl'd,
per&s;ecuted, and by all means po&s;&s;ible
mortify'd the Di&s;&s;enters, as is noted in
the Reign of his Predece&s;&s;or. This
Prince re&s;olv'd to care&s;s, cheri&s;h, and
encourage the <HI>Crolians</HI> by all po&s;&s;ible
<PB N="128" REF="132">
Arts and outward Endearments, not &s;o
much that they purpos'd them any real
Favour, <HI>for the de&s;truction of both was
equally determin'd,</HI> nor &s;o much that they
expected to draw them over to <HI>Abro|gratriani&s;m,</HI>
but Two Rea&s;ons may
be &s;uppos'd to give Ri&s;e to this Project.</P>
<P>1. The <HI>Lunarian Church</HI> Party had all
along Preach'd up for a part of their Re|ligion,
that <HI>Ab&s;olute undi&s;puted Obedience,</HI>
was due from every Subject to their
Prince without any <HI>Re&s;erve,</HI> Reluctance
or <HI>Repining;</HI> that as to Re&s;i&s;tance, it was
Fatal to <HI>Body, Soul, Religion, Ju&s;tice</HI> and
<HI>Government;</HI> and tho' the Doctrine was
Repugnant to <HI>Nature,</HI> and to the very
Supreme Command it &s;elf, yet he that
re&s;i&s;ted, receiv'd to him&s;elf Damnation,
ju&s;t <HI>for all the World</HI> like our Doctrine of
<HI>Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience.</HI> Now tho' the&s;e <HI>Solu|narian</HI>
Church-Men did not ab&s;olutely
believe all they &s;aid them&s;elves to be
true, yet they found it nece&s;&s;ary to pu&s;h
the&s;e things to the uttermo&s;t Extremi|ties,
becau&s;e they might the better fix
upon the <HI>Crolian Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> the Charge
of profe&s;&s;ing le&s;s Loyal Principles than
they. For as to the <HI>Crolians,</HI> they pro|fe&s;s'd
<PB N="129" REF="133">
openly they would pay Obedience
to the Prince, as far as the Laws direct|ed,
<HI>but no farther.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e things were run up to &s;trange
heights, and the People were always
falling out about what they would do,
or wou'd not do, if things were <HI>&s;o or &s;o,</HI>
as they were not, and <HI>were never likely to
be;</HI> and the hot Men on both &s;ides were
every now and then going together by
the Ears about <HI>Chimeras,</HI> Shadows, <HI>May|be's</HI>
and <HI>Suppo&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>The hot Men of the <HI>Solunarian Church</HI>
were for knocking the <HI>Crolians</HI> in the
Head, becau&s;e as they &s;aid they were
<HI>Rebels,</HI> their <HI>Fathers</HI> were Rebels, and
they would certainly turn Rebels again
upon occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The <HI>Crolians</HI> in&s;i&s;ted upon it, that they
had nothing to do with what was done
before they were Born, that if they were
Criminal, becau&s;e their Fathers were &s;o,
then a great many who were now of the
<HI>Solunarian Church</HI> were as Guilty as they,
&s;everal of the be&s;t Members of that
<PB N="130" REF="134">
Church having been Born of <HI>Crolian</HI>
Parents.</P>
<P>In the matter of Loyalty they in&s;i&s;ted
upon it, they were as Loyal as the <HI>Solu|narians,</HI>
for that they were as Loyal as
Nature, Rea&s;on and the Laws both of
God and Man requir'd, and what the
other talk'd of <HI>more,</HI> was but a meer
pretence, and &s;o it would be found if
ever their Prince &s;hould have occa&s;ion
to put them to the Tryal, that he that
pretended to go beyond the Power of
Nature and Rea&s;on, <HI>mu&s;t indeed go beyond
them,</HI> and they never de&s;ir'd to be brought
into the extream, but they were ready
at any time to &s;hew &s;uch Proofs, and
give &s;uch Demon&s;trations of their Loy|alty,
as would &s;atisfy any rea&s;onable
Prince, and <HI>for more they had nothing to
&s;ay.</HI></P>
<P>In this po&s;ture of Affairs, this new
Prince found his Subjects when he came
to the Crown, the <HI>Solunarian Church</HI> Ca|re&s;s'd
him, and notwith&s;tanding his be|ing
Devoted to the <HI>Abrogratzian Faith,</HI>
they Crown'd him with extraordinary
Acclamations.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="135">
They were the rather enclin'd to
pu&s;h this forward by how much they
thought it would &s;ingularly mortify the
<HI>Crolians,</HI> and all the &s;orts of <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI>
for they had all along declar'd their ab|horrence
of the <HI>Abrogratzians</HI> to &s;uch a
Degree that they publickly endeavour'd
to have got a general Concurrence of
the whole Nation in the Publick <HI>Cortez,</HI>
or <HI>Dyet</HI> of the Kingdom, to have joyn'd
with them in Excluding this very Prince
by Name, and all other Princes that
&s;hould ever embrace the <HI>Abrogratzian</HI>
Faith.</P>
<P>And it wanted but a very little of bring|ing
it to pa&s;s, for almo&s;t all the Great
Men of the Nation, tho' <HI>Solunarians,</HI> yet
that were Men of <HI>Temper,</HI> Moderation,
and <HI>Fore-&s;ight,</HI> were for this exclu&s;ive
Law. But the <HI>High Prie&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Patri|archs</HI>
of the <HI>Solunarian Church</HI> prevented
it, and upon pretence of this <HI>Pa&s;&s;ive O|bedience
Principle,</HI> made their Intere&s;t
and gave their Voices for Crowning, or
Entailing the Crown and Government
on the Head of one of the mo&s;t Impla|cable
Enemies both to their Religion
<PB N="132" REF="136">
and Civil Right that ever the Nation
&s;aw; <HI>but they liv'd to Repent it too late.</HI></P>
<P>This Conque&s;t over the <HI>Crolians</HI> and
the <HI>Moderate Solunarians,</HI> if it did not &s;up|pre&s;s
them entirely, it yet gave the other
Party &s;uch an a&s;cendant over them,
that they made no Doubt when that
Prince came to the Crown, they had
done &s;o much to oblige him, that he
could deny them nothing, and therefore
in expectation they &s;wallow'd up the
whole Body of the <HI>Crolians</HI> at once, and
began to talk of nothing le&s;s than Ba|ni&s;hing
them to the Northern part of the
Country, or to certain I&s;lands, and
Countries a va&s;t way off, where former|ly
great numbers of them had fled for
&s;helter in like Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>And this was the more probable by
an unhappy Stroke the&s;e <HI>Crolians</HI> at|tempted
to &s;trike, <HI>but mi&s;carry'd</HI> in at the
very beginning of this Prince's Reign:
for as they had always profe&s;t an aver|&s;ion
to this Prince on account of his Re|ligion,
as &s;oon as their other King was
dead, they &s;et up one of his Natural
Sons again&s;t this King, which the <HI>Solu|narians</HI>
<PB N="133" REF="137">
had &s;o joyfully Crown'd. This
young Prince invaded his Dominions, and
great Numbers of the mo&s;t zealous
<HI>Crolians</HI> joyn'd him&mdash;But to cut the
Story &s;hort, he was entirely routed by
the Forces of the new Prince, for all
the <HI>Solunarian Church</HI> joyn'd with him
again&s;t the <HI>Crolians</HI> without any re&s;pect
to the Intere&s;t of Religion, &s;o they over|threw
their Brethren: The young in|vaded
Prince was taken and put to
Death openly, and <HI>Great Cruelties</HI> were
exercis'd in cold Blood upon the poor
unhappy People that were taken in the
Defeat!</P>
<P>Thus a &s;econd time the&s;e Loyal <HI>Solu|narian
Church-men</HI> E&s;tabli&s;h'd their E|nemy,
and built up what they were glad
afterwards to pull down again, and to
beg the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e very <HI>Crolians</HI>
whom they had &s;o rudely handled, to
help them demoli&s;h the Power they
had erected them&s;elves, and which now
began to &s;et its foot upon the Throat of
tho&s;e that nouri&s;h'd and &s;upported it.</P>
<P>Upon this exceeding Loyalty and
blind A&s;&s;i&s;tance given to their Prince,
<PB N="134" REF="138">
the <HI>Solunarians</HI> made no que&s;tion but
they had &s;o Eternally bound him to
them, that it would be in their Power to
pull down the very Name of <HI>Croliani&s;m,</HI>
and utterly de&s;troy it from the Na|tion.</P>
<P>But the time came on to Undeceive
them, for this Prince, who&s;e Principle as
an <HI>Abrogratzian,</HI> was to de&s;troy them
both, as it happened, was furni&s;h'd with
Coun&s;ellors and Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks of his own
Profe&s;&s;ion, ten thousand Times more
bent for their general Ruin, than him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>For ab&s;tracted from the Venom and
Rancour of his Profe&s;&s;ion as an <HI>Abrograt|zian,</HI>
and from the furious Zeal of his
<HI>Bramin,</HI> Prie&s;ts, and Religious People,
that continually hung about him, and that
prompted him to act again&s;t his Temper
and Inclination, by which he ruin'd all,
he was el&s;e a <HI>forward</HI> and <HI>generous</HI> Prince,
and likely to have made his People Great
and Flouri&s;hing.</P>
<P>But his <HI>furious Church-Men</HI> ruin'd all
his good Designs, and turn'd all his
<PB N="135" REF="139">
Projects to compa&s;s the Introduction of
his own Religion into his Dominions.</P>
<P>Nay, and had he not fatally been
pu&s;h'd on by &s;uch as really de&s;ign'd his
Ruin, to drive this deep De&s;ign on too
ha&s;tily and turn the Scale of his Man|nagement
from a clo&s;e and conceal'd,
to an open and profe&s;s'd De&s;ign, he
might have gone a great way with it.&mdash;Had
he been content to have let
that have been twenty Year a doing,
which he impatiently as well as pre|po&s;terou&s;ly
attempted all at once.&mdash;<HI>Wise
Men have thought</HI> he might in time
have &s;uppre&s;t the <HI>Solunarian Religion,</HI>
and have &s;et up his own.</P>
<P>To give a &s;hort Scheme of his Pro|ceedings,
and with them of the rea&s;on of
his Mi&s;carriage.</P>
<P>1. Having defeated the Rebellious
<HI>Crolians,</HI> as is before noted, and reflect|ing
on the Danger he was in upon the
&s;udden Progre&s;s of that Rebellion, for
indeed he was within a trifle of Ruin
in that Affair; and had not the <HI>Crolians</HI>
been deceiv'd bp the darkne&s;s of the

Night and led to a large Ditch of Water,
which they could not pa&s;s over, they
had certainly &s;urpriz'd and overthrown
his Army, and cut them in pieces, before
they had known who had hurt them. Up|on
the Sen&s;e of this Danger, he takes
up a pretence of nece&s;&s;ity for the being al|ways
ready to re&s;i&s;t <HI>the Factious Crolians,</HI>
as he call'd them, and by that In&s;inua|tion
hooks him&s;elf into a <HI>&s;tanding Army
in time of Peace;</HI>&mdash;nay, and &s;o ea&s;y
were the <HI>Solunarian Church</HI> to yield up
any point, which they did but imagin
would help to cru&s;h their Brethren the
<HI>Crolians,</HI> that they not only con&s;ented to
this unu&s;ual Inva&s;ion of their antient Li|berties,

Joy of having arriv'd to &s;o great a Hap|pine&s;s,

grudging to put out one of their own
Eyes, &s;o they might at the &s;ame time put

them&s;elves who were a free People be|fore,
under the Power and Slavery of
the Sword.</P>
<P>The ea&s;e with which this Prince got
over &s;o con&s;iderable a Point as this, made
him begin to be too credulous, and to
per&s;wade him&s;elf that the <HI>Solunarian
Church-Men</HI> were really in earne&s;t, as
to their Pageant-Doctrin of <HI>Non Re|&s;i&s;tance,</HI>
and that as he had &s;een them
bear with &s;trange extravagancies on
the <HI>Crolian</HI> Part, they were real and
in earne&s;t when they Preach'd that Men
ought to obey for Con&s;cience's &s;ake,
whatever hard&s;hip were impos'd upon
them, and however unju&s;t, or contrary to
the Laws of God, Nature, Rea&s;on, o$
their Country; what Principle in the
World could more readily prompt a
<PB N="138" REF="142">
Prince to attempt what he &s;o earne&s;tly
coveted, as this zealous Prince did the
re&s;toring the <HI>Abrogratzian</HI> Faith, for
&s;ince he had but two &s;orts of People to
do with; one he had cru&s;h'd by force,
and had brought the other to profe&s;s it
their <HI>Religion,</HI> their <HI>Duty,</HI> and their <HI>Re|&s;olution</HI>
to bear every thing he thought
fit to Impo&s;e upon them, and that they
&s;hould be <HI>Damn'd</HI> if they <HI>re&s;i&s;ted,</HI> the
Work &s;eem'd half done to his Hand.</P>
<P>And indeed when I reflected on the
Coherence of things, I could not &s;o
much blame this Prince for his ventur|ing
upon the probability, for whoever
was but to go up to this <HI>Lunar World</HI>
and read the Stories of that Time, with
what Fury the hot Men of the <HI>Soluna|rian
Church</HI> acted again&s;t the <HI>Di&s;&s;enting
Crolians,</HI> and with what warmth they a&s;|&s;i&s;ted
their Prince again&s;t them, and
how Cruelly they in&s;ulted them after
they were defeated in their attempt of
Dethroning him, how zealou&s;ly they
Preach'd up the Doctrine of ab&s;olute
undi&s;puted Re&s;ignation to his Will,
how frequently they obey'd &s;everal of
his encroachments upon their Liberties,
<PB N="139" REF="143">
and what &s;olemn Prote&s;tations they made
to &s;ubmit to him in any thing, and to
&s;tand by and a&s;&s;i&s;t him in <HI>whatever</HI> he
Commanded them to the <HI>la&s;t Drop,</HI>
much with the &s;ame Zeal and Forward|ne&s;s,
as our <HI>Life-and-Fortune Men</HI> did
here in <HI>England.</HI> I &s;ay, when all this was
con&s;ider'd, I could not &s;o much con|demn
his Credulity, nor blame him for
believing them, for no Man could have
doubted their Sincerity, but he that at the
&s;ame time mu&s;t have Taxt them with
<HI>mo&s;t unexampled Hipocri&s;ie.</HI></P>
<P>For the <HI>Solunarians</HI> now began to
di&s;cern their Prince was not really on
their &s;ide, that neither in State Mat|ters
any more than Religion, he had
any affection for them, and the fir&s;t ab|&s;olute
Shock he gave them, was in Pub|li&s;hing
a general Liberty to the <HI>Crolians.</HI>
'Tis true this was not out of re&s;pect to
the <HI>Crolian</HI> Religion any more than the
<HI>Solunarian,</HI> but purely becau&s;e by that
means he made way for an Introduction
of the <HI>Abrogratzian</HI> Religion which now
began to appear publickly in the Coun|try.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="144">
But however, as this was directly con|trary
to the expectation of the <HI>Soluna|rians,</HI>
it gave them &s;uch a di&s;gu&s;t again&s;t
their Prince, that from that very time
being di&s;appointed in the Soveraign Au|thority
they expected, they entred into
the deepe&s;t and blacke&s;t Con&s;piracy a|gain&s;t
their Prince and his Government
that ever was heard of.</P>
<P>Many of the <HI>Crolians</HI> were deluded
by the new Favour and Liberty they
receiv'd from the Prince to believe him
real, and were glad of the Mortification
of their Brethren; but the more Judici|ous
&s;eeing plainly the Prince's De&s;ign,
<HI>declar'd against their own Liberty,</HI> becau&s;e
given them by an illegal Authority,
without the a&s;&s;ent of the whole Body
legally a&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Solunarians</HI> &s;aw this they
ea&s;ily reconcil'd them&s;elves to the <HI>Croi|lians,</HI>
at lea&s;t from the Out&s;ide of the
Face, for the carrying on their De&s;ign,
and &s;o here was a Nation full of Plots,
here was the Prince and his <HI>Abrogratzi|ans</HI>

of all &s;orts, laying a&s;ide private
Re&s;entments, and forgetting old Grudges
about Religion, in order to ruin the in|vading
Projects of the Prince and his

<P>There was indeed &s;ome verbal Condi|tions

no more Hatred, Di&s;turbance <HI>or Per&s;e|cution</HI>
for the &s;ake of Religion between
them, but that they would come to a
Temper with them, and always be Bre|thren

<P>However by this Artifice, and on
<PB N="142" REF="146">

<PB N="143" REF="147">
differs, <HI>we have always pretended to this
ab&s;olute undi&s;puted Obedience,</HI> which we
did indeed to gain the Power of your

once to your Opinion, tho' never &s;o
right, we &s;hould &s;o fly in the Face of
our own Doctrin, <HI>Sermons,</HI> innumera|ble

give all our Enemies too great a Power
over us in Argument, and we &s;hould

<P>The <HI>Crolians</HI> a&s;toni&s;h'd both at the

I ought to be mark'd down
for a Fool; nor will ever any Prince in

if ever they have their Sen&s;es about 'em,
but as this is a mo&s;t extraordinary
Scene, &s;o I cannot omit a more particu|lar
<PB N="146" REF="150">
and &s;ufficient Relation of &s;ome Parts
of it, than I us'd to give.</P>
<P>The <HI>Solunarian Clergy</HI> had carry'd on
their Non-Re&s;i&s;tance Doctrin to &s;uch Ex|termities,
and had given this new Prince
&s;uch unu&s;ual demon&s;trations of it, that
he fell ab&s;olutely <HI>into the Snare,</HI> and en|tirely
believ'd them; he had try'd them
with &s;uch Impo&s;itions as they would
never have born from any Prince in the
World, nor from him neither, had they
not had a deep De&s;ign, and con&s;equent|ly
&s;tood in need of the deepe&s;t Di&s;gui&s;e
imaginable; they had yielded to a <HI>Stand|ing
Army,</HI> and applauded it as a thing
they had de&s;ir'd; they had &s;ubmitted to
<HI>levying Taxes</HI> upon them by <HI>New Methods,</HI>
and illegal Practices; they had yielded to
the abrogation or &s;u&s;pen&s;ion at lea&s;t of
their Laws, when the King's ab&s;olute
Will requir'd it; not that they were
blind, and did not &s;ee what their Prince
was doing, but that the black De&s;ign
was &s;o deeply laid, they found it was
the only way to ruin him, to pu&s;h him
upon the highe&s;t Extreams, and then
they &s;hould have their turn &s;erv'd.&mdash;Thus
if he de&s;ir'd one illegal Thing of
<PB N="147" REF="151">
them, they would immediately grant
two; one would have thought they had
read our Bible, <HI>and the Command, when a
Man takes away the Cloak, to give him the
Coat al&s;o.</HI></P>
<P>Nor was this enough, but they &s;eem'd
willing to admit of the publick Exer|ci&s;e
of the <HI>Abrogratzian</HI> Religion in all
Parts; and when the Prince &s;et it up
in his own Chappel, they &s;uffered it to
be &s;et up in their Cities, and Towns,
and the <HI>Abrogratzian Clergy</HI> began to be
&s;een up and down in their very Habits;
a thing which had never been permit|ted
before in that Country, and which
the Common People began to be very
unea&s;y at: But &s;till the <HI>Solunarian Clergy,</HI>
and all &s;uch of the Gentry, e&s;pecially as
were in the Plot, by their Sermons,
printed Books, and publick Di&s;cour&s;es,
carry'd on this high topping Notion of
ab&s;olute Submi&s;&s;ion, &s;o that the People
were kept under, and began to &s;ubmit
to all the impo&s;itions of the Prince.</P>
<P>The&s;e things were &s;o acted to the
Life, that not only the Prince, but
none of his <HI>Abrogratzian</HI> Coun&s;ellors
<PB N="148" REF="152">
could &s;ee the Snare, the Hook was fo
finely covered by the Church-Artificers,
and the Bait &s;o delicious, that they all
&s;wallow'd it with eagerne&s;s and delight.</P>
<P>But the Con&s;pirators willing to make
a &s;ure game of it, and not thinking the
King, or all his Coun&s;ellors would
drive on &s;o fa&s;t as they would have
them, tho' they had already made a fair
Progre&s;s for the Time, re&s;olv'd to play
home, and accordingly they per&s;uade
their Prince, that they will not only
&s;ubmit to his Arbitrary Will, in Matters
of State, and Government, but in Mat|ters
of Religion; and in order to carry
this Je&s;t on, <HI>one of the heads of their Po|liticks,</HI>
and a Per&s;on of great E&s;tem for
his Abilities in Matters of State, being
without que&s;tion one of the able&s;t Heads
of all the <HI>Solunarian</HI> Nobility, <HI>pretended to
be converted,</HI> and turn'd <HI>Abrogratzian.</HI> This
immediately took as they de&s;ir'd, for the
Prince care&s;s'd him, and entertain'd him
with all po&s;&s;ible endearments, preferr'd
him to &s;everal Po&s;ts of Honour and Ad|vantage,
always kept him near him,
con&s;ulted him in all Emergencies, took
him with him to the <HI>Abrogian</HI> Sacrifices,
<PB N="149" REF="153">
and he made no Scruple publickly to
appear there, and by the&s;e degrees and
a <HI>&s;uper-achitophalian</HI> Hypocri&s;ie, &s;o in|&s;inuated
him&s;elf into the credulous
Prince's favour, that he became his only
Confident, and ab&s;olute Ma&s;ter of all
his De&s;igns.</P>
<P>Now the Plot had its de&s;ir'd effect,
for he pu&s;h'd the King upon all manner
of Precipitations; and if even the <HI>Abro|gratzians</HI>
them&s;elves who were about
the King, interpos'd for more <HI>temperate
Proceedings,</HI> he would call them Cow|ards,
Strangers, ignorant of the Tem|per
of the <HI>Lunarians,</HI> who when they
were a going, might be driven, but if
they were &s;uffered to cool and con&s;ider,
would face about and fall off.</P>
<P>Indeed the Men of Prudence and E|&s;tates
among his own Party, I mean the
<HI>Abrogratzians</HI> in the Country, frequent|ly
warn'd him to take more <HI>moderate
Mea&s;ures,</HI> and to proceed with more
Caution; told him he would certainly
ruin them all, and him&s;elf, and that
there mu&s;t be &s;ome Body about his Ma|je&s;ty
that pu&s;h'd him upon the&s;e Ex|tremes,
<PB N="150" REF="154">
on purpo&s;e to &s;et all the Nation
in a Flame, and to overthrow all the
good De&s;igns, which with Temper and
good Conduct, might be brought to
Perfection.</P>
<P>Had the&s;e wary Councils been ob|&s;erv'd,
and a Prudence and Policy agree|able
to the mighty con&s;equence of Things
been practis'd, the <HI>Solunarian Church</HI> had
run a great ri&s;que of being over thrown,
and to have &s;unk gradually in the <HI>Abro|gian
Errors,</HI> the People began to be drawn
off gradually, and the familiarity of the
thing made it appear le&s;s frightful to un|thinking
People, who had entertain'd
&s;trange Notions of the mon&s;trous things
that were to be &s;een in it, &s;o that com|mon
Vogue had fill'd the Peoples Minds
with ignorant Aver&s;ions, that 'tis no ab|&s;urdity
to &s;ay, I believe there was 200000
People who would have &s;pent the la&s;t
drop of their Blood again&s;t <HI>Abrogratzian|i&s;m,</HI>
that did not know whether it was a
<HI>Man or a Hor&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>This thing con&s;ider'd well, would
of it &s;elf have been &s;ufficient to have
made the Prince and his Friends <HI>wary,</HI>
<PB N="151" REF="155">
and to have taught them to &s;uit
their Mea&s;ures to the Nature and Cir|cum&s;tances
of Things before them; but
<HI>Succe&s;s in their beginnings</HI> blinded their
Eyes, and they fell into this <HI>Church
Snare</HI> with the mo&s;t unpitied willingne&s;s
that could be imagin'd.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing therefore this new
Coun&s;ellor put his Ma&s;ter upon, in or|der
to the beginning his more certain
Ruin, was to introduce &s;everal of his
<HI>Abrograzians</HI> into Places of all kinds,
both in the <HI>Army, Navy, Trea&s;ure,</HI> and <HI>Civil
Affairs,</HI> tho' contrary to &s;ome of the ge|neral
Con&s;titutions of Government; he
had done it into the <HI>Army</HI> before, tho'
it had di&s;gu&s;ted &s;everal of his Military
Men, but now he pu&s;h'd him upon
making it Univer&s;al, and &s;till the <HI>Pa&s;&s;ive
Solunarians</HI> bore it with patience.</P>
<P>From this tamene&s;s and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion,
his next Step was to argue that he might
depend upon it the <HI>Solunarian Church</HI>
had &s;o &s;incerely embrac'd the Doctrine
of <HI>Non-Re&s;i&s;tance,</HI> that they were now
ripen'd not only to &s;it &s;till, and &s;ee their
Brethren the <HI>Crolians</HI> &s;uppre&s;s'd, but to
<PB N="152" REF="156">
&s;tand &s;till and be oppre&s;t them&s;elves,
and he might a&s;&s;ure him&s;elf the Matter
was now ripe, he might do ju&s;t what
he wou'd him&s;elf with them, they were
prepar'd to bare any thing.</P>
<P>This was the fatal Stroke, for having
po&s;&s;e&s;t the Prince with the belief of this,
he let loo&s;e the Reins to all his long
conceal'd De&s;ires. Down went their
<HI>Laws,</HI> their <HI>Liberties,</HI> their <HI>Corporations,</HI>
their <HI>Churches,</HI> their <HI>Colleges,</HI> all went to
wreck, and the eager <HI>Abrograzians</HI>
thought the Day their own. The <HI>So|lunarians</HI>
made no oppo&s;ition, but what
was contain'd within the narrow cir|cumference
of Petitions, Addre&s;&s;es,
<HI>Prayers, and Tears;</HI> and the&s;e the Prince
was prepar'd to reject, and upon all oc|ca&s;ions
to let them know he was <HI>re|&s;olv'd to be obey'd.</HI></P>
<P>Thus he drove on by the treacherous
Advice of his new Coun&s;els, till he ri|pen'd
all the Nation for the <HI>general De|fection</HI>
which afterward follow'd.</P>
<P>For as the Encroachments of the
Prince pu&s;h'd e&s;pecially at their Church
<PB N="153" REF="157">
Liberties, and threatned the overthrow
of all their Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Privileges, the
Clergy no &s;ooner began to feel that they
were like to be the fir&s;t Sacrifice, but
they immediately threw off the Vizor,
and beat the <HI>Concionazimir;</HI> this is a
certain Eecle&s;ia&s;tick <HI>Engine</HI> which is u|&s;ual
in ca&s;es of general Alarm, as the
Churches Signal of <HI>Univer&s;al Tumult.</HI></P>
<P>This is truly a &s;trange Engine, and
when a Clergy-Man gets into the In|&s;ide
of it, and beats it, <HI>it Roars,</HI> and
makes &s;uch a terrible <HI>Noi&s;e</HI> from the &s;e|veral
Cavities, that 'tis heard a long
way; and there are always a competent
number of them plac'd in all Parts &s;o
conveniently, that the Alarm is heard
all over the Kingdom in one Day.</P>
<P>I had &s;ome Thoughts to have given
the Reader a <HI>Diagram</HI> of this piece of
Art, but as I am but a bad Drafts Man,
I have not yet been able &s;o exactly to
de&s;cribe it, as that a Scheme can be
drawn, but to the be&s;t of my Skill, take
it as follows. 'Tis a <HI>hollow Ve&s;&s;el,</HI> large

<P>I could make &s;ome <HI>Hierogliphical</HI> Di&s;|cour&s;es
upon it, from the&s;e References,
thus. 1. That as it is erected on a Pe|de&s;tal
like a Wind-Mill, &s;o it is no new
thing for the Clergy, who are the only
Per&s;ons permitted to make u&s;e of it, to
make it <HI>turn round with the Wind,</HI> and
&s;erve to all the Points of the Compa&s;s.
2. As the <HI>Flat</HI> over it a&s;&s;i&s;ts to encrea&s;e
the Sound, by forming a kind of hollow,
or cavity proper to that purpo&s;e, &s;o
there is a certain natural hollowne&s;s, or
emptine&s;s, made u&s;e of &s;ometimes in it,
by the Gentlemen of the Gown, which
&s;erves exceedingly to the propogation of
all &s;orts of <HI>Clamour, Noi&s;e, Railing,</HI> and
<HI>Di&s;turbance.</HI> 3. As the Stairs to it go
<PB N="155" REF="159">
winding up like tho&s;e by which one
mounts to the va&s;t Tun of Wine at
<HI>Hiedlebergh,</HI> which has no equal in <HI>our

<HI>Intoxications,</HI> mad and <HI>evtravagant

and <HI>Exce&s;&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ound of this Emblem of empti|ne&s;s,
the <HI>Concionazimir,</HI> was no &s;ooner
heard over the Nation, but all the Peo|ple
di&s;cover'd their readine&s;s to <HI>join in</HI>
with the Summons, and as the thing had
been concerted before, they &s;end over
their Me&s;&s;engers to demand A&s;&s;i&s;tance
from a powerful Prince beyond the Sea,
one of their own Religion, and who was
allied <HI>by Marriage</HI> to the Crown.</P>
<P>They made their Story out &s;o plain,
and their King had by the contrivance of
their <HI>Achitophel</HI> rendred him&s;elf &s;o &s;u&s;|pected
to all his Neighbours, that this
Prince, without any he&s;itation, re&s;olv'd
to join with them, and accordingly
makes va&s;t Preparations to invade their
King.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="160">
During this interval their Behaviour
was quite altred at home, the Doctrin
of <HI>ab&s;olute Submi&s;&s;ion</HI> and <HI>Non-Re&s;i&s;tance</HI>
was heard no more among them, the
<HI>Concionazimir</HI> beat daily to tell all the
People they &s;hould &s;tand up to Defend
the Rights of the Church, and that it
was time to look about them for the
<HI>Abrograzians</HI> were upon them. The
eager Clergy made this <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tick En|gine</HI>
&s;ound as loud and make all the
Noi&s;e they could, and no Men in the
Nation were &s;o forward as they to ac|knowledge
that it was a State-Trick,
and they were drawn in to make &s;uch a
&s;tir about the pretended Doctrins of <HI>ab|&s;olute
Submi&s;&s;ion,</HI> that they did not &s;ee
the Snare which lay under it, that now
their Eyes were opened, and they had
learnt to &s;ee the Power and Superiority
of Natural Right, and would be deceiv'd
no longer. <HI>Others</HI> were &s;o hone&s;t to tell
the Truth, that they knew the empti|ne&s;s
and weakne&s;s of the pretence all
along, and knew what they did when
they Preacht it up, <HI>viz. to &s;uppre&s;s and
pull down the Crolians:</HI> But they thought
their Prince who <HI>they always</HI> &s;erv'd in
crying up that Doctrin, and who&s;e Ex|clu&s;ion
<PB N="157" REF="161">
was prevented by it, would ha'
had more Gratitude, or at lea&s;t more
Sen&s;e, than to try the Experiment <HI>upon
them,</HI> &s;ince whatever to &s;erve his De|&s;igns
and their own, <HI>which they always
thought well united,</HI> they were willing to
pretend, he could not but &s;ee they <HI>al|ways
knew better</HI> than to &s;uffer the pra|ctice
of it in their own Ca&s;e. That
&s;ince he had turn'd the Tables upon
them, 'tis true he had them at an ad|vantage
and might pretend <HI>they were
Knaves,</HI> and perhaps had an opportunity
to call them &s;o with &s;ome rea&s;on; but
they were re&s;olv'd, &s;ince he had drove
them to the nece&s;&s;ity of being one or
t'other, tho' he might call them Knaves,
they would take care he &s;hould have no
rea&s;on to <HI>call them Fools</HI> too.</P>
<P>Thus the Vapour of ab&s;olute Subje|ction
was lo&s;t on a &s;uddain, and as if it
had been preparatory to what was com|ing
after, the Experiment was quickly
made; for the King per&s;uing his En|croachments
upon the Church, and be|ing
po&s;&s;e&s;t with a Belief that pur&s;uant
to their open Profe&s;&s;ions they would
&s;ubmit to any thing, he made a begin|ning
<PB N="158" REF="162">
with them, in &s;ending his po&s;itive
Command to one of his Superintendent
Prie&s;ts, or <HI>Patriarchs,</HI> to forbid a certain
Eccle&s;ia&s;tick to officiate any more till
his Royal Plea&s;ure was known.</P>
<P>Now it happen'd <HI>very unluckily</HI> that
this Patriarch, tho' none of the mo&s;t
Learned of his Fraternity, yet had al|ways
been a mighty zealous Promoter
of this blind Doctrin of <HI>Non-Re&s;i&s;tance,</HI>
and had not a little triumph'd over and
in&s;ulted the <HI>Crolian Di&s;&s;enters</HI> upon the
Notion of <HI>Rebellion,</HI> antimonarchical
Principles and Obedience, with a re&s;erve
for the Laws, and the like, as a &s;canda|lous
practice, and comprehen&s;ive of Fa|ction,
Sedition, dangerous to the
Church and State, and the like.</P>
<P>This Reverend Father was &s;ingl'd out
as the fir&s;t Mark of the King's De&s;ign:
the <HI>deluded Prince</HI> believ'd he could not
but comply, having &s;o publickly pro|fe&s;t
his being <HI>all Submi&s;&s;ion</HI> and <HI>ab&s;olute
Subjection;</HI> but as this was <HI>all Conceit,</HI>
he was pu&s;ht on to make the A&s;&s;ault
where he was mo&s;t certain to meet a
repul&s;e; and this Gentleman had long
<PB N="159" REF="163">
&s;ince thrown off the Mask, &s;o his fir&s;t
Order was di&s;obey'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Patriarch</HI> pretended to make
humble Remon&s;trances, and to offer his
Rea&s;ons why he could not in Con&s;ci|ence,
<HI>as he call'd it,</HI> comply. The King,
who was now made but a meer Engine,
<HI>or Machine,</HI> &s;crew'd up or down by this
fal&s;e Coun&s;ellor to act his approaching
De&s;truction with his own Hand, <HI>was
prompted</HI> to re&s;ent this Repul&s;e with the
utmo&s;t Indignation, to reject all manner
of Submi&s;&s;ions, Excu&s;es or Arguments, or
any thing but an immediate, ab&s;olute
compliance, according to the Doctrin &s;o
often inculcated; and this he run on &s;o
high, as to put <HI>the Patriarch in Pri&s;on</HI> for
Contumacy.</P>
<P>The <HI>Patriarch</HI> as ab&s;olutely refus'd to
&s;ubmit, and offer'd him&s;elf to the Deci|&s;ion
of the Law.</P>
<P>Now it was always a &s;acred Rule in
the&s;e <HI>Lunar Countries,</HI> that both <HI>King</HI>
and <HI>People</HI> are bound to &s;tand by the ar|bitrimnet
of <HI>the Law</HI> in all ca&s;es of
Right or Claim, whether publick or
<PB N="160" REF="164">
private; and this has been the rea&s;on
that all the Princes have endeavour'd to
cover their Actions with pretences of
Law, <HI>whatever really has been in their De|&s;ign;</HI>
for this rea&s;on the King could not
refu&s;e to bring the Patriarch to a Tryal,
where the Humour of the People fir&s;t
di&s;cover'd it &s;elf, for here <HI>Pa&s;&s;ive Obedi|ence
was Try'd and Ca&s;t,</HI> the Law lrov'd
to be &s;uperior to the King, the Patriarch
<HI>was acquitted,</HI> his Di&s;obedience to the
King <HI>ju&s;tify'd,</HI> and the King's Command
<HI>Prov'd unju&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The Applau&s;e <HI>of the Patriarch,</HI> the
Acclamations of the People, and the ge|neral
Rejoycings of the whole Nation at
this Tran&s;action, gave a black pro&s;pect
to the <HI>Abrograzians;</HI> and a great many
of them came very hone&s;tly and humbly
to the King and told him, if he conti|nued
to go on by the&s;e Mea&s;ures he
would ruin them all; they told him
what general Alarm had been over the
whole Nation by the Clamours of the
Clergy; and the beating of the <HI>Conciona|zimir</HI>
in all Parts, inform'd him how the
Doctrin of <HI>ab&s;olute Obedience</HI> was ridi|cul'd
in all Places, and how the Clergy
<PB N="161" REF="165">
began to preach it back again <HI>like a
Witches Prayer,</HI> and that it would infal|libly
rai&s;e the Devil of Rebellion in all
the Nation, they be&s;ought him to con|tent
him&s;elf with the liberty of their
Religion, and the freedom they enjoy'd
of being let into Places and Offices of
Tru&s;t and Honour, and to wait all rea|&s;onable
Occa&s;ions to encrea&s;e their Ad|vantages,
and gradually to gain Ground;
they entreated him to con&s;ider the im|po&s;&s;ibility
of reducing &s;o mighty, &s;o ob|&s;tinate,
and &s;o re&s;olute a Nation all at
once. They pleaded how rational a
thing it was to expect that by Degrees
and good Management, which by pre|cipitate
Mea&s;ures would be endanger'd
and overthrown.</P>
<P>Had the&s;e whol&s;ome Coun&s;els taken
place in the King's Mind he had been
King to his la&s;t hour, and the <HI>Solunari|ans</HI>
and <HI>Crolians</HI> too had been all un|done,
for he had certainly incroach'd
upon them gradually, and brought that to
pa&s;s in time which by precipitant
Mea&s;ures he was not likely to effect.</P>
<P>It was therefore a ma&s;ter-piece of Po|licy
<PB N="162" REF="166">
in the <HI>Solunarian</HI> Church-men to
place a feign'd Convert near their
Prince, who &s;hou'd always bia&s;s him
with contrary Advices, puff him up
with va&s;t pro&s;pect of Succe&s;s, prompt
him to all Extreams, and always Fool
him with the certainty of bringing
Things to pa&s;s his own way.</P>
<P>The&s;e Arts made him &s;et light by the
repul&s;e he met with in the Matter of the
<HI>Patriarch,</HI> and now he proceeds to make
two Attacks more upon the Church;
one was by putting &s;ome of his <HI>Abrogra|zian
Prie&s;ts</HI> into <HI>a College</HI> among &s;ome of
the <HI>Solunarian Clergy;</HI> and the other was
to oblige all the <HI>Solunarian Clergy</HI> to
read a certain Act of his Council, in
which his Maje&s;ty admitted all the <HI>Abro|grazians,
Crolians,</HI> and all &s;orts of Di&s;|&s;enters,
to a freedom of their Religious
Exerci&s;es, <HI>Sacrifices, Exorci&s;ms, Dippings,
Preachings,</HI> &amp;c. and to prohibit the <HI>So|lunarians</HI>
To Mole&s;t or Di&s;turb them.</P>
<P>Now as this la&s;t was a bitter reproach
to the <HI>Solunarian Church</HI> for all the ill
Treatment the <HI>Di&s;&s;enting Crolians</HI> had
receiv'd from them, and as it was ex|pre&s;t
<PB N="163" REF="167">
in the Act that all &s;uch Treatment
was Unju&s;t and Unchri&s;tian, &s;o for them
to read it in their Temples, was to ac|knowledge
that they had been guilty of mo&s;t
unju&s;t and irreligious Dealings to
the <HI>Crolians,</HI> and that their Prince had
taken care to do them Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The matter of introducing the <HI>Abro|grazians</HI>
into the Colleges or Seminaries
of the <HI>Solunarian Prie&s;t,</HI> was actually a|gain&s;t
the Sacred Con&s;titutions and
Foundation-Laws of <HI>tho&s;e Seminaries.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore in both the&s;e Articles they
not only di&s;obey'd their Prince, but they
oppos'd him with thofe <HI>tri&s;ling Things
call'd Laws,</HI> which they had before declar'd
had no Defen&s;ive Force again&s;t their
Prince; the&s;e they had recour&s;e to now,
in&s;i&s;ted upon the Ju&s;tice and Right de|volv'd
upon them by the Laws, and ab|solutely
refus'd their compliance with
his Commands.</P>
<P>The Prince, pu&s;ht upon the Tenters
before, receiv'd their Denial with ex|ceeding
Re&s;entment, and was heard
with deep regret, to break out in Ex|clamations
<PB N="164" REF="168">
at their unexpected faithle&s;s
Proceedings, and &s;ometimes to expre&s;s
him&s;elf thus: <HI>Horrid Hypocri&s;y! Sur|prizing
Treachery! Is this the ab&s;olute Sub|jection
which in &s;uch numerous Te&s;timonials
or Addre&s;&s;es you profe&s;t, and for which you
&s;o often and &s;o con&s;tantly branded the poor</HI>
Crolians, <HI>and told me that your Church
was wholly made up of Principles of Loyalty
and Obedience! But I'll be fully &s;atisfied
for this Treatment.</HI></P>
<P>In the minute of one of tho&s;e Excur|&s;ions
of his Pa&s;&s;ion, came into his Pre|&s;ence
the &s;eemingly revolted <HI>Lunarian
Noble Man,</HI> and falling in with his pre|&s;ent
Pa&s;&s;ions, prompts him to a &s;peedy
Revenge; and propos'd his erecting <HI>a
Court of Searches,</HI> &s;omething like the <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI>
Inqui&s;ition, giving them plenipo|tentiary
Authority to hear and deter|mine
all Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Cau&s;es ab&s;olute|ly,
and without Appeal.</P>
<P>He empower'd the&s;e Judges to place
by his ab&s;olute Will, all the <HI>Abrograzian</HI>
Students in the <HI>Solunarian College,</HI> and
tho' they might make a formal Hearing
for the &s;ake of the Form, yet that by
Force it &s;hould be done.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="169">
He gave them Power to di&s;place all
tho&s;e <HI>Solunarian Clergy</HI>-Men that had
refus'd to read his Act of Demi&s;&s;ion to
the <HI>Abrograzian, and Crolian Di&s;&s;enters,</HI>
and 'twas thought he de&s;ign'd to keep
their. Revenues in <HI>Petto,</HI> till he might
in time fill them up to &s;ome of his own
Religion.</P>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ion accordingly began
to act, and di&s;covering a full Re&s;olution
to fulfil his Command, they by Force
proceeded with the Students of the <HI>So|lunarian
College;</HI> and it was very re|markable,
that even &s;ome of the <HI>Solu|narian
Patriarchs</HI> were of this number,
who turn'd out their Brethren the <HI>Solu|narian
Students,</HI> to place <HI>Abrograzians in
their room.</HI></P>
<P>This indeed they are &s;aid to have re|pented
of &s;ince, but however, the&s;e it
&s;eems were not of the Plot, and there|fore
did not fore&s;ee what was at hand.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the <HI>Patriarchs</HI> who were
all in the Grand De&s;ign, and &s;aw things
ripening for its Execution, upon the
apprehen&s;ion of this <HI>Court of Searches</HI> be|ginning
<PB N="166" REF="170">
with them, make an humble
Addre&s;s to their Prince, containing the
Rea&s;ons why they could not comply
with his Royal Command&mdash;</P>
<P>The incens'd King upbraided them
with his having been told by them of
their ab&s;olute and <HI>unre&s;erv'd Obedi|ence,</HI>
and refu&s;ing their Submi&s;&s;ions or
their Rea&s;ons, <HI>&s;ent them all to Jail,</HI> and re|&s;olv'd
to have brought them before his
new <HI>High Court of Searches,</HI> in order, as
was believ'd, to have them all di&s;plac'd.</P>
<P>And now all began to be in a Flame,
the Sollicitations of the <HI>Solunarian Par|ty,</HI>
having obtain'd powerful Relief A|broad,
they began to make &s;uitable pre|parations
at Home. The Gentry and
Nobility who the Clergy had brought
to join with them, furni&s;h'd them&s;elves
with Hor&s;es and Arms, and prepar'd with
their Tenants and Dependants to join
the Succours as &s;oon as they &s;hould Arrive.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the Forreign Troops they
had procur'd, Arriv'd, Landed, and
publi&s;h'd a long Declaration of all the
Grievances which they came to redre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="171">
No &s;ooner was this Forreign Army
arriv'd with the Prince at the head of
them, but the face of Affairs <HI>altred on a
&s;uddain.</HI> The King indeed, like a brave
Prince, drew all his Forces together,
and marching out of his Capital City,
advanc'd above 500 <HI>Stages,</HI> things <HI>they
mea&s;ure Land with in tho&s;e Countries,</HI> and
much about <HI>our Furlong,</HI> to meet his E|nemy.</P>
<P>He had a gallant Army well appointed
and furni&s;h'd, and all things much &s;upe|rior
to his Adver&s;ary, but alas the Poi&s;on
of Di&s;obedience was gotten in there, and
upon the fir&s;t <HI>March</HI> he offer'd to make to|wards
the Enemy one of <HI>his great Captains</HI>
with a &s;trong Party of his Men went over
and revolted.</P>
<P>This Example was applauded all over
the Nation, and by this time one of the Pa|triarchs,
even the &s;ame mention'd before
that had &s;o often preacht Non-Re&s;i&s;tance
of Princes, lays by his Sacred Ve&s;tments,
Mitre, and Staff, and exchanging his
Robes for a Soldier's Coat, mounts on
Hor&s;eback, and in &s;hort, appears in Arms
again&s;t his Lord.&mdash;Nor was this all,

with him &s;everal <HI>Solunarian Lords,</HI> and
Per&s;ons of the highe&s;t Figure, and of
The Hou&s;hold, and Family of the King,
and with him went the King's own
Daughter, his principle Favourites and
Friends.</P>
<P>At the News of this, the poor de|&s;erted
Prince lo&s;t all Courage, and a|bandoning
him&s;elf to De&s;pair, he cau&s;es
his Army to retreat without fighting
a Stroke, quits them and the Kingdom
at once, and takes Sanctuary with &s;uch
as could e&s;cape with him, in the Court
of a Neighbouring Prince.</P>
<P>I have heard this Prince exceedingly
blam'd, for giving him&s;elf up to De&s;|pair
&s;o &s;oon.&mdash;That he thereby a|bandon'd
the be&s;t and faithfulle&s;t ot his

<PB N="169" REF="173">

were there, and have thereby made him
Superior at Sea to his Enemies, and he
was already much Superior at Land;
that there he might have been reliev'd
with Forces too &s;trong for them to
match, and at lea&s;t might have put it
to the I&s;&s;ue of a fair Battle.&mdash;Others,
that he might have retreated to his own
Court, and capital City, and taking
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Citadel, which was his

and left the <HI>Solunarian Church-Men</HI> a
Token to remember their <HI>Non-Re&s;i&s;ting
Doctrine by,</HI> and yet have made an ea&s;y
Retreat down the Harbour, to other
Forts he had below, and might with
ea&s;e have de&s;troy'd all the Shipping
as he went.</P>
<P>'Tis confe&s;s'd had he done either, or
both the&s;e things, he had left them a

as things came to this height, <HI>the Achi|tophel</HI>
we have &s;o often mention'd, <HI>left

&s;o bere&s;t of Coun&s;el that he fell into
the Hands of his Enemies as he was
making his e&s;cape, but he got away a|gain,
not without the connivance of
the Enemy, who were willing enough
he &s;hould go; &s;o he got a Ve&s;&s;el to car|ry
him over to the Neighbouring King|dom,

<P>The Neighbouring Prince entertain'd
him very kindly, Cheri&s;h'd him, Suc|cour'd

to this Day.</P>

and having Summon'd a general A&s;|&s;embly
of all their <HI>Capital Men,</HI> they
gave the Crown to this Prince who had
&s;o generou&s;ly &s;av'd them.</P>
<P>And here again, I heard the fir&s;t
King exceedingly blam'd for quitting
his Dominions, for had he &s;taid here,
tho' he had actually been in their Hands,
unle&s;s they wou'd have Murther'd him,
they could never have proceeded to the
Extremeties they did reach to, nor cou'd
they ever have Crown'd the other
Prince, he being yet alive, and in his
own Dominions.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="176">
But by quitting the Country, they
fix'd a legal Period to their Obedience,
he having de&s;erted their Protection, and
Defence, and openly laid down the Ad|mini&s;tration.</P>

might, or might not have happen'd.</P>
<P>It remains to examine how tho&s;e <HI>So|lunarians</HI>
behav'd them&s;elves, who had
&s;o earne&s;tly cryed up the Principles of
Obedience, and absolute Submi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Nothing was &s;o Ridiculous,</HI> now they
&s;aw what they had done, they began

Submi&s;&s;ion, boa&s;t of Martyrdom, and

arriv'd at a Power, which all the Wi&s;e

the Internal Feuds at home, and their
<HI>Analogy to ours,</HI> and whatever is in&s;tru|ctively
to be&punc; deduced from them, was
the Subject of immediate Inquiry.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="196">
No &s;ooner was this Prince plac'd on

both &s;atisfy'd the de&s;ires of the <HI>Crolians,</HI>

gave an unhappy Stroke to the Nation's

<P>But as the&s;e were too numerous Evils,

<P>There had been <HI>a ha&s;ty Peace</HI> conclud|ed

numerous Legions of Forces, in order

<P>So great an A&s;cendant had the <HI>Per|&s;onal

obtain this one Article, which they

They freely join'd in <HI>Acts of
Succe&s;&s;ion, Abjuration, Declaration</HI> of the

<P><PB N="200" REF="206">
<HI>'Tis true the&s;e were great things,</HI> but

Prince and the Confederate Nations,
a Proof what ju&s;t apprehen&s;ions they
had of his Conduct, at the head of &s;uch

a Treaty which the Prince <HI>upon a pro&s;|pect

entred into with the Enemy, and which

very unfit to begin, or carry on, and
which they would never have dar'd to
break had not <HI>this Feud</HI> happen'd.</P>

<P>He was forward enough to begin it, and
in compliance with his People, re re|&s;olv'd
on it; but <HI>the Grief</HI> of the u&s;age
he had receiv'd, the unkind Treatment
he had met with from tho&s;e very People
that brought him thither, had <HI>&s;unk &s;o</HI>
deep upon his Spirits, that he could ne|ver
recover it; but being very weak in
Body and Mind, and join'd to a &s;light hurt
he receiv'd by a fall from his Hor&s;e, <HI>he
dyed,</HI> to the un&s;peakable grief of all his
Subjects that wi&s;h'd well to their Na|tive
Country.</P>
<P>This was the melancholly Account
of this great Prince's end, and I have been
told that at once every Year, there is a
kind <HI>of Fa&s;t,</HI> or &s;olemn 'Commemora|tion

did not declare War again&s;t, and root

<P>The <HI>hot Men of the Solunarian Church</HI>

us'd him wor&s;t of all; for they not only
abandon'd him, but <HI>reproacht him as an
Enemy</HI> that would ha' them de&s;troy'd:
So one &s;ide rail'd at him becau&s;e they
<HI>did under&s;tand</HI> him, and the other becau&s;e
<HI>they did not.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the Man &s;unk under the general

left a Monument of what every Man
mu&s;t; expect that &s;erves a good Cau&s;e,
<HI>profe&s;t</HI> by an <HI>unthankful People.</HI></P>
<P>And here it was I found out that my
Lunar Philo&s;opher was <HI>only &s;o</HI> in Di&s;|gui&s;e,
and that <HI>he was no Philo&s;opher, but
the very Man</HI> I have been talking of.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="220">
<HI>From this Book,</HI> and the Treatment its
Author receiv'd, for they us'd him with
all po&s;&s;ible Rigour, a new Scene of Par|ties
came upon the Stage, and this
Queen's Reign began to be fill'd with
more Divi&s;ions and Feuds than any be|fore
her.</P>
<P><HI>The&s;e Parties</HI> began to be &s;o numerous
and violent that <HI>it endanger'd the Publick
Good,</HI> and gave great Di&s;advantages to
the general Affairs abroad.</P>
<P>The Queen invited them all to <HI>Peace
and Union,</HI> but 'twas in vain; nay, one
had the Impudence to publi&s;h that to
procure Peace and &V;nion it was nece&s;|&s;ary
to &s;uppre&s;s <HI>all the Crolians,</HI> and have
no Party but one, and then all mu&s;t be
of a Mind.</P>
<P>From this heat of Parties all the mo|derate
Men fell in with their Queen,
and were heartily <HI>for Peace and &V;nion:</HI>
The other, who were now di&s;tingui&s;h'd
by the Title of <HI>High Solunarians,</HI> call'd
the&s;e all <HI>Crolians</HI> and <HI>Low Solunarians,</HI>
and began to Treat them with more
Inveteracy than they us'd to do the <HI>Cro|lians,
<PB N="215" REF="221">
lians</HI> them&s;elves, calling them <HI>Traytors</HI> to
their Country, <HI>Betrayers</HI> of their Mother,

&s;ting and hi&s;s at the Hand that &s;uccour'd

Contrivances and <HI>Plots</HI> that ever

pretended <HI>to any Brains,</HI> or to half a
degree <HI>of common</HI> Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>There had always been Di&s;likes and
Di&s;ta&s;ts between even the mo&s;t mode|rate
<HI>Solunarians</HI> and the <HI>Crolians,</HI> as I
have noted in the beginning of this
Relation, and the&s;e were deriv'd
from <HI>Di&s;&s;enting in Opinions of Religion,</HI>
ancient Feuds, private Intere&s;t, Educa|tion,
and the like; and the <HI>Solunarians</HI>
had frequently, on pretence of &s;ecuring
the Government, made Laws to ex|clued
the <HI>Crolians</HI> from any part of the
Admini&s;tration, unle&s;s they &s;ubmitted
to &s;ome <HI>Religious Te&s;ts</HI> and Ceremonies
which were pre&s;crib'd them.</P>
<P>Now as <HI>the keeping them out of Offices</HI>
was more the De&s;ign than the <HI>Conver|&s;ion
<PB N="216" REF="222">
of the Crolians</HI> to the <HI>Solunarian</HI>
Church, the <HI>Crolians,</HI> at lea&s;t many of
them, <HI>&s;ubmitted to the Te&s;t,</HI> and frequent|ly
Conform'd to qualify them&s;elves for
publick Employments.</P>
<P><HI>The mo&s;t moderate of the Solunarians</HI>
were in their Opinion again&s;t this pra|ctice,
and the <HI>High Men</HI> taking advan|tage
of them, <HI>drew them in</HI> to Concur in
making a Law with yet more Severity
again&s;t them, effectually to keep them
out of Employment.</P>
<P><HI>The low Solunarians</HI> were ea&s;y to be
drawn into this Project, as it was only
a Confirming former Laws of their own
making, and all Things run fair <HI>for the
De&s;ign;</HI> but as the <HI>High Men</HI> had further
Ends in it than barely reducing the <HI>Cro|lians</HI>
to Conformity, they coucht &s;o ma|ny
gro&s;s Clau&s;es into their Law, that
even the <HI>Grandees of the Solunarians</HI>
them&s;elves could not comply with; nay
even the <HI>Patriarchs</HI> of the <HI>Solunarian</HI>
Church declar'd again&s;t it, as tending
to Per&s;ecution and Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>This Di&s;appointment <HI>enrag'd the Party,</HI>
<PB N="217" REF="223">
and that very Rage entirely ruin'd their
Project; for now the <HI>Nobility,</HI> the <HI>Pa|triarchs,</HI>

<P>Here I could not but ob&s;erve, as I
have done before in the Ca&s;e of the ba|ni&s;h'd

Solunarian Church-men acted</HI> in all their
Proceedings, for had they contented

their Work, they had done it effectually;
but pu&s;hing at Extremities they over|&s;hot
them&s;elves, and <HI>ruin'd all.</HI></P>
<P>For <HI>the Grandees</HI> and <HI>Patriarchs</HI> made
but a <HI>few trifling Objections</HI> at fir&s;t, nay and
came off, and yielded &s;ome of them too;
<PB N="218" REF="224">
and if the&s;e would ha' con&s;ented to ha'
parted with &s;ome Clau&s;es which they

and &s;o they lo&s;t them&s;elves.</P>
<P>If they rail'd at the <HI>low Solunarian

Clamors at them now, all the <HI>Patriarchs,</HI>
and all the Nobility and <HI>Grandees,</HI> nay
even the <HI>Queen</HI> her &s;elf came under their
Cen&s;ure, and every Body who was not of
their Mind were <HI>Pre&s;tarians</HI> and <HI>Crolians.</HI></P>
<P>As this Rage of theirs was implacable,
&s;o, as I hinted before, it drove them into

&s;ome of the&s;e <HI>high Solunarians</HI> appear'd in

it as a Law, but by &s;till loading it with

wherein he invited the People <HI>to Mur|ther</HI>
and De&s;troy <HI>all the Crolians,</HI> Brand|ed
all the <HI>Solunarian Patriarchs, Clergy</HI>

<HI>his Propo&s;al,</HI> with the name of <HI>Cowards,
Traytors</HI> and <HI>Betrayers</HI> of <HI>Lunar Religion;</HI>
having beat the <HI>Concionazimir</HI> at a great
A&s;&s;embly of the Cadirs, <HI>or Judges,</HI> and
told them <HI>all the Crolians</HI> were <HI>Devils,</HI>
and they were <HI>all Perjur'd</HI> that did not
u&s;e them as &s;uch: He carry'd on Mat|ters
<HI>&s;o dexterous&s;ly,</HI> and with &s;uch &s;urpriz|ing
Succe&s;s, that he fill'd even <HI>the Solu|narians</HI>

in one of their publick Halls where all
&s;uch Writings <HI>as are new</HI> are laid a cer|tain

I &s;aw a little <HI>knot of Men</HI> round a Ta|ble,

<PB N="222" REF="228">
There were two <HI>Solunarian High Prie&s;ts</HI>
in their proper Ve&s;tments, one <HI>Privy
Councellor</HI> of the State, one other <HI>Noble
Man,</HI> and one who had <HI>in his Hat</HI> a To|ken,
to &s;ignifie that he po&s;&s;e&s;t one of the
<HI>fine Feathers</HI> of the <HI>Con&s;olidator,</HI> of
which I have given the De&s;cription al|ready.</P>
<P><HI>The Book being read</HI> by one of the ha|bited
Prie&s;ts, he &s;tarts up with &s;ome
warmth, <HI>by the Moon, &s;ays he,</HI> I have
<HI>found this Fellow out,</HI> he is certainly a
<HI>Crolian,</HI> a meer <HI>Pre&s;tarian Crolian,</HI>
and is crept into our Church only <HI>in
Di&s;gui&s;e,</HI> for 'tis certain all this is <HI>but
meer Banter</HI> and Irony to expo&s;e us, and
to ridicule the <HI>Solunarian</HI> Intere&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>The Privy Councellor</HI> took it pre&s;ently,
whether he is <HI>a Crolian,</HI> or no, &s;ays he, I
cannot tell, but he has certainly <HI>done
the Crolians &s;o much Service,</HI> that if they
had hir'd him to act for them, they
could not have de&s;ir'd he &s;hould &s;erve
them better.</P>
<P>Truly, &s;ays <HI>the Man of the Feather,</HI> I
was always for pulling down the <HI>Crolians,</HI>
<PB N="223" REF="229">
for I thought them dangerous to the
State; but this Man has brought the
Matter <HI>nearer to my View,</HI> and &s;hown me
<HI>what de&s;troying them is,</HI> for he put me up|on
examining the Con&s;equences, and
now I find it would be <HI>lopping off the
Limbs of the Government,</HI> and laying it at
the Mercy of the Enemy <HI>that they might
lop off its Head;</HI> I a&s;&s;ure you he has done
<HI>the Crolians</HI> great Service, for whereas
abundance of our Men <HI>of the Feather</HI> were
for routing the <HI>Crolians,</HI> they lately fell
down to 134 or thereabouts.</P>
<P>All this confirm'd the fir&s;t Man's Opi|nion
that <HI>he was a Crolian in Di&s;gui&s;e,</HI> or
an Emi&s;&s;ary employ'd by them to rui$
the Project of their Enemies; for <HI>the&s;e
Crolians are damn'd cunning People in their
may,</HI> and they have Mony enough to en|gage
Hirelings to their &s;ide.</P>
<P>Another Party concern'd in <HI>this Plot</HI>
was an old; <HI>ca&s;t-out Solunarian Priest,</HI>
who, tho' profe&s;&s;ing him&s;elf a <HI>Soluna|rian,</HI>

This Man draws <HI>the mo&s;t mon&s;trous Pi|cture

From this famous Author I could not
but proceed to ob&s;erve the farther Pro|gre&s;s
of this mo&s;t refrn'd piece of Cun|ning,
among, the <HI>very great Ones, Gran|dees,
Feathers,</HI> and <HI>Con&s;olidators</HI> of the
Country. For the&s;e <HI>Cunning Crolians</HI>
manag'd their Intriegues &s;o nicely, that
they brought about a Famous Divi&s;ion
even among the <HI>High Solunarian Party
them&s;elves;</HI> and whereas the Law of Qua|lification
was reviv'd again, and in
great Danger of being completed; the&s;e
&s;ubtle <HI>Crolians</HI> brought over One Hun|dred
and Thirty Four <HI>of the Feathers</HI> in
the Famous <HI>Con&s;olidator</HI> to be of their
&s;ide, and to <HI>contrive the utter De&s;truction
of it; and thus fell the De&s;ign</HI> which the
<HI>High Solunarian</HI> Church Men had laid
for the Ruin of <HI>the Crolians Intere&s;t,</HI>
by their own Friends fir&s;t joining in
all the Extremes they had propo&s;ed, and
then pu&s;hing it so much farther, and to
&s;uch <HI>mad Periods</HI> that the very highe&s;t
Of them <HI>&s;tood amaz'd</HI> at the De&s;ign,
<HI>&s;tartled, flew back</HI> and made a <HI>full &s;top;</HI>
They were willing to Ruin the <HI>Crolians,</HI>
but they were not willing to Ruin the
whole Nation. The more these Men
began to con&s;ider, the more furiou&s;ly
the&s;e Plotters carry'd on their Extrava|gances;
<PB N="226" REF="232">
at la&s;t they made <HI>a General pu&s;h</HI>
at a thing in which they knew if the
other <HI>High Men</HI> joyn'd, they mu&s;t throw
<HI>all into Confu&s;ion,</HI> bring a <HI>Foreign Enemy</HI>
on their Backs, <HI>unravel all the Thread of

<HI>Blood</HI> and <HI>Confu&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>They knew well enough that mo&s;t of
the <HI>High Men</HI> would he&s;itate at this,
they knew if they did not the <HI>Grandees</HI>

they plaid the <HI>&s;ure&s;t Game</HI> to bla&s;tl and
overthrow this Law, that could po&s;&s;ibly
be plaid.</P>
<P>If any Man, <HI>in the whole World in the

From hence all the Men of any fore|&s;ight

but <HI>the Wi&s;er Heads</HI> who ar|gu'd
the other way, always brought
them, as is noted above, to this pinch
of Argument; that either it mu&s;t be &s;o,
<HI>be a Fanatick Crolian Plot,</HI> or el&s;e the
<HI>Men of Fury</HI> were all <HI>Fools, Madmen,</HI> and

<P>It mu&s;t be allow'd, the&s;e <HI>Crolians</HI>

the <HI>Crolians</HI> having recour&s;e to the

pretending it was forg'd, and after very
ill Treating him, <HI>condemn'd him to the

<P>But it happen'd, to their great Mor|tification,
that this Man found more

from tho&s;e <HI>of the Word,</HI> and &s;o found

every Article of their Charge, and to
vindicate his own Character, that when
the very Judges heard it, tho' they were
all <HI>Solunarians</HI> them&s;elves, they held up
their Hands, and declar'd in open

that ever came before them, and that the
Actors ought to be made Examples no <HI>all

<P>The Per&s;ons concern'd, us'd all po&s;&s;i|ble

thinking &s;till to weary the poor Man
out.&mdash;But now his Brethren the <HI>Cro|lians</HI>
began to fee them&s;elves wounded
thro' his Sides, and above all, finding
his Innocence clear'd up beyond all man|ner

and a&s;&s;i&s;ted him to pro&s;ecute his Ene|mies,

<P>Indeed when I &s;aw the Proceedings

<P>For really &s;uch Proceedings as the&s;e
were the greate&s;t pieces of Service to

for as it generally proves in other

<HI>Mi&s;chief unju&s;tly contriv'd</HI> falls upon the

their treble Di&s;honour, &s;o it was here;
the barbarity and inhumane Treatment

blu&s;h for their Brethren, and own
that the Puni&s;hment awarded on them

<P><PB N="245" REF="251">

on the Stage, and expo&s;e both
them and their Cau&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>But this was not all,</HI> by the&s;e ince&s;|&s;ant

their unkindne&s;s, ask'd them
what it was they de&s;ir'd of him?</P>
<P>They told him, they had heard that

in a way to &s;ecure them&s;elves from

&s;uch a Secret, he would communicate it
to them, and they would be &s;ure to <HI>re|member

liv'd.</HI></P>
<P>He frankly told them <HI>he had &s;aid &s;o,

way to do all this if they would follow
his Directions. <HI>What's that, &s;ays one</HI> of the
mo&s;t earne&s;t Enquirers?&mdash;'Tis inclu|ded
in one Word, &s;ays he, UNITE.</P>
<P>This mo&s;t &s;ignificant Word, deeply
and &s;olidly reflected upon, put them up|on
&s;trange and various Conjectures, and
many long Debates they had with them|&s;elves
about it; at la&s;t they came again
to him, and ask'd him <HI>what he mean't by it?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="254">
He told them he knew they were
<HI>Strangers to the meaning</HI> of the thing,
and therefore if they would meet him
the next Day he would come prepar'd
to explain him&s;elf; accordingly they
meet, when in&s;tead of a long Speech

<P>This <HI>Hyerogliphical</HI> Admonition was

but &s;till as they are an ob&s;tinate
People, and not a little valuing them|&s;elves
upon their own Knowledge and
Penetration, they &s;lighted the Engine

<HI>Suppo&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>1. Some concluded he mean't <HI>&V;nit
with the Solunarian Church,</HI> and they re|flected

being the Que&s;tion in Hand, and &s;ome|thing
remote from their Intention, or
the High <HI>Solunarians</HI> De&s;ire.</P>
<P>2. Some mean't &V;nite to the moderate

&s;aid they had done already.</P>
<P>At la&s;t &s;ome <HI>being very Cunning,</HI> found

&s;ome imagin'd he mean't down right
Rebellion, Uniting Power, and Mobbing

<P>At la&s;t they took the Hint, that his
Advice directed them <HI>to &V;nite their &s;ub|divided

and to act in Concert upon one bottom,
to lay a&s;ide the Selfi&s;h, Narrow, <HI>Su&s;pi|cious

Intere&s;t into a Form.</HI></P>
<P>The Author of this Advice having

prove his Propo&s;al, they demanded his

Mea&s;ures had upon the whole <HI>Solunarian</HI>

<P>As &s;oon as ever they had &s;ettled

reconcile Differences, to unite Parties,
to &s;uppre&s;s Feuds in their beginning.</P>
<P>They appointed 3 <HI>general Meetings</HI> in 3
of the mo&s;t remote Parts of the Kingdom,
to be half yearly, and <HI>one univer&s;al Meet|ing</HI>
of Per&s;ons deputed to concert mat|ters
among them in General.</P>
<P>By that time the&s;e Meetings had &s;at
but once, and the Conduct of the Coun|cil
of 12 began to appear, 'twas a won|der
to &s;ee the prodigious alteration it
made all over the Country.</P>
<P>Immediately <HI>a Crolian</HI> would <HI>never
buy any thing</HI> but of a <HI>Crolian;</HI> would
hire no Servants, employ neither Porter

<P>In their capital City the Merchandiz|ing
<HI>Crolians</HI> would freight no Ships but
of which the Owners and Commanders
were <HI>Crolians.</HI></P>
<P>They call'd all their Ca&s;h out of the
<HI>Solunarian Bank;</HI> and as the Act of the
<HI>Cortez</HI> confirming the Bank then in
being &s;eem'd to be their Support, they
made it plain that Ca&s;h and Credit will
make a Bank without a publick Settle|ment
of Law; <HI>and without the&s;e</HI> all the
Laws in the <HI>Moon</HI> will never be able to
&s;upport it.</P>
<P>They brought all their running Ca&s;h
into one Bank, and &s;ettled a &s;ub-Ca&s;h

by a &s;trict Corre&s;pondence and credit|ing
their Bills, they might be able to &s;et|tle

the beginning continually Encroaching
into all &s;orts of People and Societies,

not qualify'd by Law, but meerly Volun|tarily,
call'd in the Moon by a hard long

<P>The other &s;ort of People <HI>go on</HI> after

to be out of Fa&s;hion, they always found
one thing or other to amu&s;e and deceive

all manner of things, Publick as well as

<P>'Tis true this began to be notorious,

all this not only before the Old Con&s;oli|dator
was broke up, but even while it
was actually whole and in u&s;e.</P>
<P>Had this hurry been to &s;end up good
Feathers, there had been the le&s;s to &s;ay,
but that which made it very &s;trange to me
was, that where the very wor&s;t of all the
Feathers were to be found, there was
the mo&s;t of this wicked Work; and tho'
it was bad enough every where, yet the
greate&s;t bu&s;tle and contrivance was in
order to &s;end up the wor&s;t Feathers they
could get.</P>
<P>And indeed &s;ome Places &s;uch Sorry,

any one could have the Impudence

<P>And &s;till in all my Ob&s;ervation, this

<P><PB N="163" REF="269">
It was really a melancholly Thing to

<P>It was really &s;trange that this &s;hould
be the Ca&s;e, after &s;o many Laws, and &s;o
lately made, again&s;t it; but in this, tho&s;e

<P>For in the Moon this hurry about

the greate&s;t heighth imaginable,
<PB N="264" REF="270">

were made to &s;uppre&s;s it; for now at a
certain publick Place where the <HI>Bloute|gondegours</HI>
us'd to meet every Day, any
Body that had but Mony enough might
buy a Feather at a rea&s;onable Rate, and
never go down into the Country to
fetch it; nay, the Trade grew &s;o
hot, that of a &s;udden as if no other Bu|&s;ine&s;s
was in Hand, all People were up|on
it, and the whole Market was chang'd
from Selling of Bear-Skins, to Buying of
Feathers.</P>
<P>Some gave this for a Rea&s;on why all
the Stocks of the Societies fell &s;o fa&s;t,
but there were other Rea&s;ons to be gi|ven
for that, &s;uch as Clubs, Cabals,
Stock-Jobbers, Knights, Merchants and
Thie&mdash;s. I mean <HI>a private Sort,</HI> not &s;uch
as are frequently Hang'd there, but <HI>of a
wor&s;e Sort,</HI> by how much they <HI>merit that
Puni&s;hment more,</HI> but are out of the

was,</HI> there was not Employment for half

&s;erv'd to keep them under, prevent their
being valued in the Government, and
<PB N="272" REF="278">
given the other Party va&s;t Advantages
again&s;t.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Solunarians</HI> driving thus furi|ou&s;ly
<HI>at their De&s;truction</HI> and entire Ru|in,
open'd their Eyes to the following
Mea&s;ures for their pre&s;ervation: And
here again <HI>the high Solunarians</HI> may &s;ee,
and doubtle&s;s whenever they made u&s;e
of the Lunar-Gla&s;&s;es they mu&s;t &s;ee it,
that nothing could ha' driven the <HI>Cro|lians</HI>
to make u&s;e of &s;uch Methods for
their Defence, but the ra&s;h Proceedings
of their own warm Men, in order to
&s;uppre&s;&s;ing the whole <HI>Crolian</HI> Intere&s;t.
And this might inform our Country|men
of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> that it
cannot but be their Intere&s;t to Treat
their Brethren with Moderation and
Temper, lea&s;t their Extravagances
&s;hould one time or other drive the other
as it were by Force into their Sen&s;es, and
open their Eyes to do only all tho&s;e
Things which by Law they may do, and
which they are laught at by all the World
for not doing.</P>
<P>This was the very Ca&s;e in the Moon:
The Philo&s;opher, <HI>or pretended-&s;uch as be|&s;ore,</HI>
<PB N="273" REF="279">
had often publi&s;h'd, that <HI>it was
their Intere&s;t to</HI> UNITE; bur their Eyes
not being open to the true Cau&s;es and
Nece&s;&s;ity of it, their Ears were &s;hut a|gain&s;t
the Council, <HI>till Oppre&s;&s;ion and Ne|ce&s;&s;ities
drove them to it.</HI></P>
<P>Accordingly they entred into a &s;erious
Debate, of the State of their own Af|fairs,
and finding the Advice given, ve|ry
rea&s;onable; they &s;et about it, and
the Author gave them a Model, En|titl'd
<HI>An enquiry into what the Crolians may
lawfully do, to prevent the certain Ruin of
their Intere&s;t, and bring their Enemies to
Peace.</HI></P>
<P>I will not pretend to examine the
Contents of this &s;ublime Tract; but
from this very Day, we found the <HI>Cro|lians</HI>
in the Moon, acting quite on a
different Foot from all their former
Conduct, putting on a new Temper,
and a new Face, as you have hear'd.</P>
<P>All this while the hot <HI>Solunarians</HI> cri|ed
out <HI>Plots, A&s;&s;ociations, Confederacies</HI>
and <HI>Rebellions,</HI> when indeed here was
nothing done but what the <HI>Laws ju&s;ti|fy'd,</HI>
<PB N="274" REF="280">
what <HI>Rea&s;on directed,</HI> and what <HI>had
the Crolians but made u&s;e of the Cogitator,</HI>
they would ha' done 40 Year before.</P>
<P>The Truth is, the other People had
no Remedy, but <HI>to cry Murther,</HI> and
make <HI>a</HI> Noi&s;e; for the <HI>Crolians</HI> went on
with their Affairs, and E&s;tabli&s;ht them|&s;elves
&s;o, that when I came away, they
were become a mo&s;t Solid, and well
United Body, made a con&s;iderable Fi|gure
in the Nation, and yet the Govern|ment
was ea&s;y; for the <HI>Solunarians</HI> found
when they had attain'd the utmo&s;t end
of their Wi&s;hes, her <HI>Solunarian Maje&s;ty</HI>
was as &s;afe as before, and the <HI>Crolians</HI>
Property being &s;ecur'd, they were as
Loyal Subjects as the <HI>Solunarians,</HI> as
con&s;i&s;tent with Monarchy, as u&s;eful to
it, and <HI>as pleas'd with it.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot but Remark here, that
this <HI>&V;nion of the Crolians</HI> among them|&s;elves
had another Con&s;equence, which
made it appear it was not only to their
own Advantage, but to the general
Good of all the Nati$n.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="281">
For, <HI>by little, and little,</HI> the Feuds of
the Parties cool'd, and the <HI>Solunarians</HI>
began to be better reconcil'd to them;
the Government was <HI>ea&s;y and &s;a&s;e,</HI> and
the private Quarrels, as I have been told
&s;ince, begin to be quite forgot.</P>
<P>What Blindne&s;s, <HI>&s;aid I to my &s;elf,</HI> has
po&s;&s;e&s;t the Di&s;&s;enters in our unhappy
Country of <HI>England,</HI> where by eternal
<HI>Di&s;cords, Feuds, Di&s;tru&s;ts</HI> and a|mong
them&s;elves, they always fill their
Enemies with <HI>Di&s;gu&s;ts</HI> Hopes, that by pu&s;hing
at them, they may one time or other
compleat their Ruin; which Expecta|tion
has always &s;erv'd as a means to
keep open the Quarrel; whereas had
the Di&s;&s;enters been United in <HI>Intere&s;t,
Affection</HI> and <HI>Mannagement</HI> among them|&s;elves,
all this Heat had long ago <HI>been
over,</HI> and the Nation, tho' there had
been <HI>two Opinions</HI> had retain'd but <HI>one
Intere&s;t,</HI> been joyn'd in Affection, and
<HI>Peace at Home been rais'd</HI> up to that De|gree
that all Wi&s;e Men wi&s;h, as it is
now among the Inhabitants of the
World in the Moon.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="282">
'Tis true, in all the Ob&s;ervations I
made in this Lunar Country, the va&s;t
deference paid to the Per&s;ons of Princes
began to le&s;&s;en, and whatever Re&s;pect
they had for the <HI>Office,</HI> they found it ne|ce&s;&s;ary
frequently to tell the World that
<HI>on occa&s;ion,</HI> they could Treat them with
le&s;s Re&s;pect than <HI>they pretended to own
them.</HI></P>
<P>For about this time, the <HI>Divine Right</HI>
of Kings, and the Inheritances of Prin|ces
<HI>in the Moon,</HI> met with a terrible
Shock, and that by the <HI>Solunarian Party
them&s;elves;</HI> and in&s;omuch that even my
Philo&s;opher, and he was none of the <HI>Jure
Divino Men,</HI> neither declar'd, again&s;t it.</P>
<P>They made <HI>Crowns perfect Foot-balls,</HI>
&s;et up what Kings they would, and
<HI>pull'd down</HI> &s;uch as they did not like, <HI>Rati|tione
Voluntas,</HI> right or wrong, as they
thought be&s;t, of which &s;ome Examples
&s;hall be given by and by.</P>
<P>After I had thus enquir'd into the Hi|&s;torical
Affairs of this Lunar Nation,
which for its Similitude to my Native
Country, I could not but be inqui&s;itive
<PB N="277" REF="283">
in; I wav'd a$great many material Things,
which at lea&s;t I cannot enter upon the
Relation of here, and began to enquire
into their Affairs abroad.</P>
<P>I think I took notice in the beginning
of my Account of the&s;e Parts, that I
found them engag'd in a tedious and
bloody War, with one of the mo&s;t
mighty Monarchs of all the Moon.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t therefore hint, that among the
multitude of things, which for brevity
&s;ake I omit, the Reader may ob&s;erve
the&s;e were &s;ome.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That this was the &s;ame Monarch
who harbour'd and entertain'd the <HI>Abro|gratzian</HI>
Prince, who was fled as be|fore,
and who we are to call the King
of <HI>Gallunaria.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. I have omitted the Account of a
long and bloody War, which la&s;ted a
great many Years, and which the pre&s;ent
Queens Predece&s;&s;or, mannag'd with a
great deal of Bravery and Conduct, and
fini&s;ht very much to his own Glory, and
the Nations Advantage.</ITEM>
<PB N="278" REF="284">
<ITEM>3. I have too much omitted to Note,
how <HI>Barbarou&s;ly</HI> the <HI>High Solunarian
Church Men</HI> treated him for all his Ser|vices,
upbraided him with the Expence
of the War; and tho' he &s;av'd them all
from Ruin and <HI>Abrogratziani&s;m,</HI> yet had
not one good Word for him, and in|deed
'tis with &s;ome difficulty that I pa&s;s
this over, becau&s;e it might be nece&s;&s;ary
to ob&s;erve, be&s;ides what is &s;aid before,
that Ingratitude is a Vice in Nature, and
practis'd every where, as well as in <HI>En|gland.</HI>
So that we need not upbraid the <HI>Par|ty</HI>
among us with their ill Treatment of
the late King, for the&s;e People us'd their
good King every Jot as bad, till their
unkindne&s;s perfectly broke his Heart.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Here al&s;o I am oblig'd to omit the
Hi&s;torical Part of the War, and of the
Peace that follow'd; only I mu&s;t ob|&s;erve
that this Peace was very <HI>Precarious,</HI>
Short and <HI>&V;nhappy,</HI> and in a few Months
the War broke out again, with as much
Fury as ever.</P>
<P>In this War happen'd one of the &s;trang|e&s;t,
unaccountable and mo&s;t prepo&s;te|rous
<PB N="279" REF="285">
Actions, that ever a People in their
National Capacity could be guilty of.</P>
<P>Certainly if our People in <HI>England,</HI>
who pretend that King&s;hip is <HI>Jure Di|vino,</HI>
did but know the Story of which
I &s;peak, they would be quite of another
Mind; wherefore I crave leave to re|late
part of the Hi&s;tory, or Original of
this la&s;t War, as a nece&s;&s;ary Introdu|ction
to the proper Ob&s;ervations I &s;hall
make upon it.</P>
<P>There was a King of a certain Country
in the Moon, call'd in their Language,
<HI>Ebronia,</HI> who was formerly a Confede|rate
with the <HI>Solunarians.</HI> This Prince
dying without I&s;&s;ue, the great Monarch
we &s;peak of, &s;eiz'd upon all his Domi|nions
as his Right.&mdash;Tho' if I remem|ber
right, he had formerly Sworn never
to lay Claim to it, and after that by a
&s;ub&s;equent Treaty had agreed with the
<HI>Solunarian</HI> Prince, that another Monarch
who claim'd a Right as well as he,
&s;hould divide it between them.</P>
<P>The breach of this Agreement, and
&s;eizing this Kingdom, put almo&s;t all the
<PB N="280" REF="286">
Lunar World into a Flame, and War
hung over the Heads of all the Nor|thern
Nations of the Moon, for &s;eve|ral
Claims were made to the Succe&s;&s;ion
by other Princes, and particularly by a
certain Potent Prince call'd the <HI>Eagle,</HI> of
an Ancient Family, who&s;e <HI>Lunar</HI> Name
I cannot well expre&s;s, but in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> it
&s;ignifies <HI>the Men of the great Lip;</HI> whe|ther
it was Originally a &s;ort of a Nick
Name, or whether they had any &s;uch
thing as a great Lip Hereditary to the
Family, by which they were di&s;tin|gui&s;ht,
is not worth my while to Exa|mine.</P>
<P>'Tis without que&s;tion that the &s;ucce&s;|&s;ive
Right, <HI>if their Lunar Succe&s;&s;ions, are
Govern'd as ours are in this World,</HI> devolv'd
upon this Man <HI>with the Lip</HI> and his Fa|milies;
but the <HI>Gallunarian</HI> Monarch
brought things &s;o to pa&s;s, by his extraor|dinary
Conduct, that the <HI>Ebronian</HI> King
was drawn in by &s;ome of his Nobility,
<HI>who this Prince had Bought</HI> and Brib'd to be|tray
their Country to his Intere&s;t, and
particularly a certain <HI>High Prie&s;t</HI> of that
Country, to make an A&s;&s;ignment, or <HI>deed
of Gift</HI> of all his Dominions to the
<PB N="281" REF="287">
Grand&s;on of this <HI>Gallunarian</HI> Monarch.</P>
<P><HI>By Vertue of this Gift,</HI> or Legacy, as
&s;oon as the King dyed, who was then
langui&s;hing, and as the other Party al|ledg'd,
not in <HI>a very good capacity to make
a Will;</HI> the <HI>Gallunarian</HI> King &s;ent his
Grand&s;on to &s;eize upon the Crown, and
backing him with &s;uitable Forces, took
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all his &s;trong Fortifications
and Frontiers.</P>
<P>Nor was this all, <HI>the Man with the Lip</HI>
indeed talkt big, and threatned War
immediately, but the <HI>Solunarians</HI> were
&s;o un&s;ettl'd at Home, &s;o unprepar'd for
War, having but ju&s;t di&s;mi&s;t their Auxi|liar
Troops, and disbanded their own,
and the Prince was &s;o ill &s;erv'd by his
Subjects, that both he and a Powerful
Neighbour, Nations in the &s;ame Inte|re&s;t,
were meerly Bullyed by this <HI>Gallu|narian;</HI>
and as he threatned immediate|ly
to Invade them, which they were
then in no Condition to prevent, he
forc'd them both to &s;ubmit to his De|mand,
<HI>tacitely allow</HI> what he had done
in breaking the Treaty with him, and
at la&s;t openly <HI>acknowledge</HI> his new King.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="288">
<HI>This was indeed a mo&s;t unaccountable Step,</HI>
but there was a nece&s;&s;ity to plead, for
he was at their very Doors with his For|ces;
and this Neighbouring People, who
they call <HI>Mogenites,</HI> could not re&s;i&s;t him
without help from the <HI>Solunarians,</HI>
which they were very backward in,
notwith&s;tanding the <HI>earne&s;t Sollicitations
of their Prince,</HI> and notwith&s;tanding they
were oblig'd to do it <HI>by a &s;olemn Trea|ty</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e delays oblig'd them to this &s;trange
Step of <HI>acknowledging</HI> the Inva&s;ion of
their Enemy, and <HI>pulling off the Hat</HI> to
the New King he had &s;et up.</P>
<P><HI>'Tis true,</HI> the Policy of the&s;e Lunar Na|tions
was very Remarkable in this Ca&s;e,
and they out-witted the <HI>Gallunarian</HI> Mo|narch
in it; for by the owning this
Prince, whom they immediately after
<HI>Declar'd a &V;&s;urper,</HI> and made War a|gain&s;t;
they &s;topt the Mouth of the
<HI>Gallunarian</HI> his Grandfather, took from
him all pretence of Invading them,
and <HI>making him believe they were Sincere,</HI>
Wheedl'd him to re&s;tore &s;everal Thou|&s;ands
of their Men who he had taken
<PB N="283" REF="289">
Pri&s;oners in the Frontier Towns of the
<HI>Ebronians.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Had the</HI> Gallunarian Prince had but
the foreca&s;t to ha' &s;een, that this was
but a for$'d pretence to gain Time, and
that as &s;oon as they had <HI>their Troops clear</HI>
and Time to rai&s;e more, they would
certainly turn upon him again, he
would never ha' been put by with &s;o
weak a Trifle as the <HI>Ceremony of Congra|tulation;</HI>
whereas had he immediately
pu&s;ht at them with all his Forces, they
mu&s;t ha' been Ruin'd, and he had car|ry'd
his Point without much Interrup|tion.</P>
<P>But here he lo&s;t his Opportunity,
which he never retriev'd; <HI>for 'tis in the
Moon, ju&s;t as 'tis here,</HI> when an Occa&s;ion is
lo&s;t, it is not ea&s;y to be recover'd, for both
the <HI>Solunarians</HI> and the <HI>Mogenites</HI> quickly
threw off the Mask, and declaring this
new Prince an <HI>&V;&s;urper,</HI> and his Grand|father
an <HI>&V;nju&s;t breaker of Treaties,</HI> they
prepar'd for War again&s;t them both.</P>
<P>As to the Hone&s;ty of this matter, my
Philo&s;opher and I differ'd extremely, he
<PB N="284" REF="290">
exclaim'd again&s;t the Honour of acknow|ledging
a King, with a de&s;ign to Depo&s;e
him, and pretending Peace when War
is de&s;ign'd; tho' 'tis true, they are too
cu&s;tomary in our World; but however,
as to him I in&s;i&s;ted upon the lawfulne&s;s
of it, from the univer&s;al Cu&s;tom of Na|tions,
who generally do things ten times
more Prepo&s;terous and Incon&s;i&s;tent,
when they &s;uit their Occa&s;ions. Yet I
hope no Body will think I am recom|mending
them by this Relation to the
Practice of our own Nations, but rather
expo&s;ing them as unaccountable things
never to be put in Practice, without
quitting all pretences to Ju&s;tice and na|tional
Hone&s;ty.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;e was this.</P>
<P>As upon the Progre&s;s of Matters be|fore
related, the <HI>Solunarians</HI> and <HI>Moge|nites</HI>
had made a formal acknowledg|ment
of this new Monarch, the Grand|&s;on
of the <HI>Gallunarian</HI> King, &s;o as I have
hinted already, they had no other de|&s;ign
than to Depo&s;e him, and pull him
down.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="291">
Accordingly, as &s;oon as <HI>by the afore|&s;aid
Wile</HI> they had gain'd Breath, and
furni&s;ht them&s;elves with Forces, they
<HI>declar'd War</HI> again&s;t both the <HI>Gallunari|an</HI>
King, and this Grand&s;on, and entred
into &s;trict Confederacy with <HI>the Man of
the great Lip,</HI> who was the Monarch of
the <HI>Eagle,</HI> and who by right of <HI>Succe&s;|&s;ion,</HI>
had the true Claim to the <HI>Ebroni|an</HI>
Crowns.</P>
<P>In the&s;e Declarations they alledge that
Crowns do not <HI>de&s;cend by Gift,</HI> nor are
Kingdoms given away <HI>by Legacy,</HI> like a
Gold <HI>Ring at a Funeral,</HI> and therefore this
Young Prince could have no Right, the
former deceas'd King having <HI>no Right to
di&s;po&s;e it by Gift.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t allow, that judging by our
Rea&s;on, and the Practice in our Coun|tries
here, <HI>on this &s;ide the Moon;</HI> this
&s;eem'd plain, and I &s;aw no difference in
matters of Truth there, or here, but
Right and Liberty both of Princes and
People &s;eems to be the &s;ame in that
World, as it is in this, and upon this
account I thought the Rea&s;ons of this
War very Just, and that the Claim of
<PB N="286" REF="292">
Right to the Succe&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Ebronian</HI>
Crown, was undoubtedly <HI>in the man
with the Lip,</HI> and his Heirs, and &s;o far
the War was mo&s;t Ju&s;t, and the De&s;ign
rea&s;onable.</P>
<P>And thus far my Lunar Companion
agreed with me, and had they gone on &s;o,
&s;ays he, they had my good Wi&s;hes, and
my Judgment had been Witne&s;s to my
Pretences, that they were in the right.</P>
<P>But in the pro&s;ecution of this War,
&s;ays he, they went on to one of the
mo&s;t Impolitick, Ridiculous, Di&s;hone&s;t,
and Incon&s;i&s;tent Actions, that ever any
Nation, in the Moon was guilty of; the
Fact was thus.</P>
<P>Having agreed among them&s;elves that
the <HI>Ebronian</HI> Crown &s;hould not be po&s;|&s;e&s;t
by the <HI>Gallunarian</HI> King's Grand&s;on,
they in the next Place began to con&s;ider
who &s;hould have it.</P>
<P><HI>The Man with the Lip had the Title,</HI> but
he had a great Government of his own,
Powerful, Happy and Remote, being as
is noted, the Lord of the great <HI>Eagle,</HI>
<PB N="287" REF="293">
and he told them he could not pretend
<HI>to come to Ebronia to be a King there;</HI> his
elde&s;t Son truly was not only declar'd
Heir apparent to his Father, but had
another <HI>Lunarian Kingdom</HI> of his own
&s;till more remote than that, and he
would not quit all this for the Crown of
<HI>Ebronia,</HI> &s;o it was concerted by all the
Confederated Parties, that the <HI>second
Son</HI> of this Prince, <HI>the man with the Lip,</HI>
&s;hould be declar'd King, and here lay
the Inju&s;tice of all the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s at my first examining this
Matter, I did not &s;ee far into it, nor
could I reach the Di&s;hone&s;ty of it, and
perhaps the Reader of the&s;e Sheets may
be in the &s;ame Ca&s;e; but my old <HI>Luna|rian
Friend</HI> being continually exclaiming
again&s;t the Matter, and blaming his Coun|try-men
the <HI>Solunarians</HI> for the Di&s;ho|ne&s;ty,
of it, but e&s;pecially the <HI>Mogenites,</HI>
he began to be &s;omething peevi&s;h with
me that I &s;hould be &s;o dull as not to
reach it, and askt me if he &s;hould &s;crew
me into the <HI>Thinking-Pre&s;s</HI> for the Clear|ing
up my Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>At la&s;t he told me he would write his
<PB N="288" REF="294">
particular Sentiments of this whole Af|fair
in a Letter to me, which he would
&s;o order as it &s;hould <HI>effectually open mine
Eyes;</HI> which indeed it did, and &s;o I be|lieve
it will the Eyes of all that read it;
to which purpo&s;e I have obtain'd of the
Author <HI>to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in the Tran&s;lation</HI> of it,
he having &s;ome Knowledge al&s;o in our

<OPENER>Friend from the Moon,</OPENER>
<P>&startq;ACcording to my promi&s;e, I hereby
give you a Scheme of <HI>Solunarian</HI>
Hone&s;ty, join'd with <HI>Mogenite</HI> Policy,
and my Opinion of the Action of my
Country-men and their Confederates,
in declaring their new made <HI>Ebronian</HI>
King.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The <HI>Mogenites</HI> and <HI>Solunarians</HI> are
look'd upon here to be the Original
Contrivers of this ridiculous piece of
Pageantry, and tho' &s;ome of their
Neighbours are &s;uppos'd to have a
Hand in it, yet we all lay it at the
<PB N="289" REF="295">
door of their Politicks, and for the Ho|ne&s;ty
of it let them an&s;wer it if they
can.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;'Tis ob&s;erv'd here, that as &s;oon as
the King of <HI>Gallunaria</HI> had declar'd
that he accepted the Will and Di&s;po&s;i|tion
of the Crown of <HI>Ebronia,</HI> in fa|vour
of his Grand&s;on, and that ac|cording
to the &s;aid Di&s;po&s;ition, he
had own'd him for King; and in or|der
to make it effectual, had put him
into immediate Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the King|dom.
The <HI>Mogenites</HI> and their Confede|rates
made wonderful Clamours at the
Inju&s;tice of his Proceedings, and par|ticularly
on account of his breaking
the Treaty then lately entred into
with the King of the <HI>Solunarians</HI> and the
<HI>Mogenites,</HI> for the &s;ettling the Matter of
Right and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, in ca&s;e of the De|mi&s;e
of the <HI>Ebronian</HI> King.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;However, the King of <HI>Gallunaria</HI> had
no &s;ooner plac'd his Grand&s;on on the
Throne, but the <HI>Mogenites</HI> and other
Nations, and <HI>to all our Wonder,</HI> the
King of <HI>Solunaria</HI> him&s;elf acknowledg'd
him, own'd him, &s;ent their Min&s;ters,
<PB N="290" REF="296">
and Compliments of Congratulation,
and the like, giving him the Title of
King of <HI>Ebronia.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Tho' this proceeding had &s;omething
of Surprize in it, and all Men expect|ed
to &s;ee &s;omething more than ordina|ry
Politick in the effect of it, yet it
did not give half the a&s;toni&s;hment to
the Lunar World, as this unaccounta|ble
Mon&s;ter of Politicks begins to
do.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;We have here two unlucky Fellows,
call'd <HI>Pa&s;quin</HI> and <HI>Marforio,</HI> the&s;e had a
long Dialogue about this very Matter,
and <HI>Pa&s;quin</HI> as he always lov'd Mi&s;chief,
told a very unlucky Story to his Com|rade,
of a high <HI>Mogenite</HI> Skipper, as fol|lows.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;A <HI>Mogenite</HI> Ship coming from a far
Country, the Cu&s;tom Hou&s;e Officers
found &s;ome Goods on Board, which
were Controband, and for which they
pretended the Ship and Goods were
all Confi&s;cated; the Skipper, or <HI>Cap|tain</HI>
in a great Fright, comes up to the
Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e, and being told he mu&s;t
<PB N="291" REF="297">
Swear to &s;omething relating to his
taking in tho&s;e Goods, reply'd in his
Country <HI>Jargon, Ta-dat &s;all Ick doen
Myn Heer;</HI> or in <HI>Engli&s;h, Ay, Ay, I'll
Swear.</HI>&mdash;But finding they did not a&s;|&s;ure
him that it would clear his Ship
he &s;cruples the Oath again, at which
they told him it would clear his Ship
immediately. <HI>Hael, well Myn Heer,</HI>
&s;ays the <HI>Mogen</HI> Man, <HI>vat mot Ick &s;agen,
Ick &s;all all Swear myn Skip to &s;alvare,</HI> i. e.
I &s;hall Swear any thing to &s;ave my
Skip.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;We apply this Story thus.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If the <HI>Mogenites</HI> did acknowledge the
King of <HI>Ebronia,</HI> we did believe it was
done <HI>to &s;ave the Skip;</HI> and when they
reproacht the <HI>Gallunarian</HI> King, with
breaking the Treaty of Divi&s;ion, we
us'd to &s;ay we would all break thro'
twice as many Engagements for half as
much Advantage.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This &s;etting up a new King, a|gain&s;t
a King on the Throne, Acknow|ledg'd
and Congratulated by them, is
not only look'd on in the Lunar World,
<PB N="292" REF="298">
as a thing Ridiculous, but particularly
Infamous, that they &s;hould fir&s;t acknow|ledge
a King, and then &s;et up the Ti|tle
of another. If the Title of the
fir&s;t <HI>Ebronian</HI> King be good, this mu&s;t
be an Impo&s;tor, an U&s;urper of another
Man's Right; if it was not good, why
did they acknowledge him, and give
him the full Title of all the <HI>Ebronian</HI>
Dominions? Care&s;s and Congratulate
him, and make a publick Action of
it to his Amba&s;&s;ador.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Will they tell us they were Bully'd,
and Frighted into it? that is to own
they may be hufft into an ill Action; for
owning a Man in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what
is none of his own, is an ill thing, and he
that may be hufft into one ill Action,
may by Con&s;equence be hufft into ano|ther,
and &s;o into any thing.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What will they &s;ay for doing it? we
have heard there has been in the
World you came from, a way found
out to own Kings <HI>de Facto,</HI> but not <HI>de
Jure;</HI> if they will fly to that ridiculous
Shift, let them tell the World &s;o, that
we may know what they mean, for
<PB N="293" REF="299">
tho&s;e fooli&s;h things are not known
here.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If they own'd the King of <HI>Ebronia</HI>
voluntarily, and acknowledg'd his Right
as we thought they had; how then
can this young Gentleman have a Ti|tle,
unle&s;s they have found out a new
Divi&s;ion, and &s;o will have two Kings
of <HI>Ebronia,</HI> make them Partners, and
have a <HI>Gallunarian</HI> King of <HI>Ebronia,</HI> and
a <HI>Mogenite</HI> King of <HI>Ebronia,</HI> both toge|ther?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Our Lunar Nations, Princes and
States, whatever they may do in your
World, always &s;eek for &s;ome Pretences
at lea&s;t to make their Actions &s;eem
Hone&s;t, whither they are &s;o or no;
and therefore they generally publi&s;h
Memorials, Manife&s;to's and Decla|rations,
of their Rea&s;ons why, and
on what account they do &s;o, or &s;o;
that tho&s;e who have any Grounds to
charge them with Unju&s;tice, may be
an&s;wer'd, and &s;ilenc'd; 'tis for the
People in your Country, to fall upon
their Neighbours, only becau&s;e they
will do it, and make probability of
<PB N="294" REF="300">
Conque&s;t, a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on of Con|que&s;t;
the <HI>Lunarian</HI> Nations are
&s;eldom &s;o de&s;titute of Mode&s;ty, but
that they will make a &s;hew of Ju&s;tice,
and make out the Rea&s;ons of their Pro|ceedings;
and tho' &s;ometimes we find
even the Rea&s;ons given for &s;ome A|ctions
are weak enough; yet it is a
bad Cau&s;e indeed, that can neither
have a true Rea&s;on, nor a pretended
one. The cu&s;tom of the Moon has o|blig'd
us to &s;how &s;o much re&s;pect to
Hone&s;ty, that when our Actions
have the least colour of Hone&s;ty, yet
we will make Rea&s;ons to look like a
Defence, whether it be &s;o or no.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But here is an Action that has nei|ther
reality, nor pretence, here is not
Face enough upon it to bear an Apolo|gy.
Fir&s;t, they acknowledge one King,
and then &s;et up another King again&s;t
him; either they fir&s;t acknowledg'd a
wrong King, and thereby became Par|ties
to a U&s;urper, or they act now a|gain&s;t
all the Rules of common Ju&s;tice
in the World, to &s;et up a &s;ham King,
to pull down a true one, only becau&s;e
'tis their Intere&s;t to have it &s;o.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="301">
&startq;This makes the very Name of a <HI>So|lunarian</HI>
&s;candalous to all the Moon,
and Mankind look upon them with the
utmo&s;t Prejudice, as if they were a
Nation who had &s;old all their Hone&s;ty
to their Intere&s;t; and who could act
this way to Day, and that way to Mor|row,
without any regard to Truth, or
the Rule of Honour, Equity or Con|&s;cience;
<HI>This is Swearing any thing to
&s;ave the Skip;</HI> and never let any Man
Reproach the <HI>Gallunarian</HI> King with
breaking the Treaty of Divi&s;ion, and
di&s;regarding the Faith and Stipulations
of Leagues; for this is an Action &s;o in|con&s;i&s;tent
with it &s;elf, &s;o incongruous
to common Ju&s;tice, to the Rea&s;on and
Nature of things, that no Hi&s;tory of
any of the&s;e latter Times can parallel
it, and 'tis pa&s;t the Power of Art, to
make any rea&s;onable Defence for it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Indeed &s;ome lame Rea&s;ons are gi|ven
for, it by our Polititians. Fir&s;t,
they &s;ay the Prince with the great
Lip was extremely pre&s;t by the <HI>Gal|lunarians</HI>
at Home in his own Coun|try,
and not without apprehen&s;ions
<PB N="296" REF="302">
of &s;eeing them e'er long, under the
Walls of his capital City.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;From this circum&s;tance of the Man
with the Lip, 'twas not irrational to
expect that he might be induc'd to make
a &s;eparate Peace with the <HI>Gallunarians,</HI>
and &s;erve them as he did once the Prince
of <HI>Berlindia</HI> at the Treaty of Peace in a
former War, where he de&s;erted him after
the &s;olemne&s;t Engagements never to
make Peace without him; but his
pre&s;&s;ing Occa&s;ions requiring it, con|cluded
a Peace without him, and left
him to come out of the War, as well
as he could, tho' he had come into it
only for his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, Now find|ing
him in danger of being ruin'd by
the <HI>Gallunarian</HI> Power, and judging
from former Practice in like Ca&s;es,
that he might be hurry'd into a Peace,
and leave them in the Lurch; they
have drawn him into this Labrinth, as
into a Step, which can never be re|ceded
from without the utmo&s;t Affront
and Di&s;grace, either to the Family of
the <HI>Gallunarian,</HI> or of the Lip; an A|ction
which in its own Nature, is a
Defiance of the whole <HI>Gallunarian</HI>
<PB N="297" REF="303">
Power, and without any other Mani|fe&s;to,
may be taken as a Declaration
from the Hou&s;e of the <HI>Lip,</HI> to the <HI>Gal|lunarian,</HI>
that this War &s;hall never
end, till one of tho&s;e two Families are
ruin'd and reduc'd.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What Condition the Prince with
the Lip's Power is in, to make &s;uch a
huff at this Time, &s;hall come under
Examination by and by; in the mean
time the <HI>Solunarians</HI> have clench'd the
Nail, and &s;ecur'd the War to la&s;t as
long as they think convenient.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If the Gallunarians &s;hould get the
better, and reduce the <HI>Man with the
Lip</HI> to Terms never &s;o di&s;advantageons,
he cannot now make a Peace without
leave from the <HI>Solunarians</HI> and the
<HI>Mogenites,</HI> lea&s;t his Son &s;hould be ruin'd
al&s;o.&mdash;Or if he &s;hould make Articles
for him&s;elf, it mu&s;t be with ten times
the Di&s;honour that he might have
done before.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Politicians &s;ay, 'tis never good for a
Prince to put him&s;elf into a ca&s;e of
De&s;peration. This is drawing the
<PB N="298" REF="304">
Sword, and throwing away the Scab|bard;
if a Di&s;a&s;ter &s;hould befal him,
his Retreat is impo&s;&s;ible, and this
mu&s;t have been done only to &s;ecure
the <HI>Man with the Lip</HI> from being hufft,
or frighted into a &s;eparate Peace.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The &s;econd Rea&s;on People here give,
why the <HI>Solunarians</HI> are concerning
them&s;elves in this Matter, is drawn
from Trade.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The continuing of <HI>Ebronia</HI> in the
Hands of the <HI>Gallunarians,</HI> will mo&s;t
certainly be the De&s;truction of the
<HI>Solunarian</HI> and <HI>Mogenites</HI> Trade, both
to that Kingdom, and the whole Seas
on that &s;ide of the Moon; as this Ar|ticle
includes a fifth Part of all the
Trade of the Moon, and would in
Conjunction with the <HI>Gallunarians</HI> at
la&s;t bring the Ma&s;ter&s;hip of the Sea,
out of the Hands of the other, &s;o it
would in effect be more detriment to
tho&s;e two Nations, than ten Kingdoms
lo&s;t, if they had them to part with.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="305">
&startq;This the <HI>Solunarians</HI> fore&s;eeing, and
being extremely &s;en&s;ible of the entire
Ruin of their Trade, have left no
Stone unturn'd to bring this piece of
Pageantry on the Stage, by which they
have hook'd in the Old Black <HI>Eagle</HI> to
plunge him&s;elf over Head and Ears in
the Quarrel, in &s;uch a manner, as he
can never go back with any tolerable
Honour; he can never quit his Son and
the Crown of <HI>Ebronia,</HI> without the
greate&s;t Reproach and Di&s;grace of all
the World in the Moon.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Now whether one, or both of the&s;e
Rea&s;ons are true in this Ca&s;e, as mo&s;t
believe both of them to be true; the
Policy of my Country-men, the <HI>Solu|narians</HI>
is vi&s;ible indeed, but as for their
Hone&s;ty, it is pa&s;t finding out.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But it is objected here, this Son <HI>of
the Lip</HI> has an undoubted Right to the
Crown of <HI>Ebronia.</HI> We do not Fight
now to &s;et up an U&s;urper, but to pull
down an U&s;urper, and it has been made
plain by the Manife&s;to, that the giv|ing
a Kingdom by Will, is no convey|ance
of Right; the Prince of the <HI>Ea|gle</HI>
<PB N="300" REF="306">
has an undoubted Right, and they
Fight to maintain it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If this be true, then we mu&s;t ask
the&s;e High and Mighty Gentlemen
how came they to recognize and ac|knowledge
the pre&s;ent King on the
Throne? why did they own a U&s;urper
if he be &s;uch? either one or other mu&s;t
be an act of Cowardize and Inju&s;tice,
and all the Politicks of the Moon can|not
clear them of one of the&s;e two
Charges; either they were Cowardly
Knaves, before, or el&s;e they mu&s;t be
Cunning Knaves now.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If the Young <HI>Eagle</HI> has an undoubted Title
now, &s;o he had before, and they
Knew it as well before, as they do
now; what can they &s;ay for them|&s;elves,
why they &s;hould own a King,
they knew had no Title, or what can
they &s;ay for going to pull down one
that has a Title?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I mu&s;t be allow'd to di&s;tingui&s;h be|tween
Fighting with a Nation, and
Fighting with the King. For Example.
Our Quarrel with the <HI>Gallunarians</HI> is
<PB N="301" REF="307">
with the whole Nation, as they are
grown too &s;trong for their Neighbours.
But our Quarrel with <HI>Ebronia</HI> is not with
the Nation, but with their King, and
this Quarrel &s;eems to be unju&s;t in this
particular, at lea&s;t in them who own'd
him to be King, for that put an end
to the Controver&s;y.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;'Tis true, the Ju&s;tice of publick A|ctions,
either in Princes, or in States,
is no &s;uch nice Thing, that any Body
&s;hould be &s;urpriz'd, to &s;ee the Govern|ment
forfeit their Faith, and it &s;eems
the <HI>Solunarians</HI> are no more careful
this way, than their Neighbours. But
then tho&s;e People &s;hould in e&s;pecial
manner forbear to reproach other Na|tions
and Princes, with the breaches
which they them&s;elves are &s;ubject
too&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;As to the <HI>Eagle,</HI> we have nothing to
&s;ay to the Hone&s;ty of his declaring his
Son King of <HI>Ebronia,</HI> for as is hinted be|fore,
he never acknowledg'd the Title of
the U&s;urper, but always declar'd, and
in&s;i&s;ted on his own undoubted Right,
<PB N="302" REF="308">
and that he would recover it if he
could.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Without doubt the <HI>Eagle</HI> has a Title
by Proximity of Blood, founded on the
renunciation of the King of <HI>Galluna|ria</HI>
formerly mention'd, and if the
Will of the late King be Invalid, or
he had no Right to give the Soveraign|ty
of his Kingdoms away, then the
<HI>Eagle</HI> is next Heir.&endq;</P>
<P>But as we quit: his Morals, and ju|&s;tify
the Hone&s;ty of his Proceedings in
the War, again&s;t the pre&s;ent King of
<HI>Ebronia,</HI> &s;o in this Action of declaring
his &s;econd Son. We mu&s;t begin to
que&s;tion his Under&s;tanding, and &s;av|ing
a re&s;pect of decency, it looks as if
his Mu&s;ical Head was out of Tune,
to <HI>Illus tratellus.</HI> I crave leave to
tell you a Story out of your own
Country, which we have heard of hi|ther.
A <HI>French</HI> Man that could &s;peak
but broken <HI>England,</HI> was at the Court
of <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> when on &s;ome occa&s;ion he
happen'd to hear the Title of the King of
<HI>England</HI> read thus, <HI>Charles the</HI> II. <HI>King
of England, Scotland, France and Ireland.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="309">
Vat is dat you &s;ay? &s;ays Mon&s;ieur, be|ing
a little affronted, the Man reads
it again, as before. <HI>Charles &s;he Second,
King of England, Scotland, France and
Ireland.&mdash;Charles the Second, King of
France! Ma Foy,</HI> &s;ays the French Man,
<HI>you can no read, Charles the Second, King
of France ha! ha! ha! Charles the Se|cond,
King of France, when he can catch.</HI>
Any one may apply the Story, whether
it was a true one or no.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;All the Lunar World looks on it,
therefore, as a mo&s;t Ridiculous, Sen&s;e|le&s;s
Thing, to make a Man a King of
a Country he has not one Foot
of Land in, nor can have a Foot there,
but what he mu&s;t Fight for. As to the
probability of gaining it, I have no|thing
to &s;ay to it, but if we may gue&s;s
at his Succe&s;s there, by what has been
done in other Parts of the Moon, we
find he has Fought three Campaigns,
to lo&s;e every Foot he had got.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It had been much more to the Ho|nour
of the <HI>Eagle</HI>'s Conduct, and of
the young Hero him&s;elf, fir&s;t to ha'
let him ha' fac'd his Enemy in the Field,
<PB N="304" REF="310">
and as &s;oon as he had beaten him, the
<HI>Ebronians</HI> would have acknowledg'd
him fa&s;t enough; or his own Victorious
Troops might have Proclaim'd him at
the Gate of their Capital City; and if
after all, the Succe&s;s of the War had
deny'd him the Crown he had fought
for, he had the Honour to have &s;hown
his Bravery, and he had been where he
was, a Prince of the Great Lip. A Son
of the <HI>Eagle</HI> is a Title much more Ho|nourable
than a King without a Crown,
without Subjects, without a Kingdom,
and another Man upon his Throne;
but by this declaring him King, the
<HI>old Eagle</HI> has put him under a nece&s;&s;ity
of gaining the Kingdom of <HI>Ebronia,</HI>
which at be&s;t is a great hazard, or if
he fails to be mi&s;erably de&s;picable, and
to bear all his Life the con&s;tant Cha|grin
of a great Title and no Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;How ridiculous will this poor Young
Gentleman look, if at la&s;t he &s;hould
be forc'd to come Home again with|out
his Kingdom? what a King of
Clouts will he pa&s;s for, and what will
this <HI>King-making old Gentleman, his Fa|ther
<PB N="305" REF="311">
&s;ay,</HI> when the young Hero &s;hall
tell him, your Maje&s;ty has made me a
Mock King for ail the World to laugh
at.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;'Twas certainly the weake&s;t Thing
that could be, for the <HI>Eagle</HI> thus to make
him a King of that, which, were the pro|bability
greater than it is, he may ea&s;ily,
without the help of a Miracle, be di&s;ap|pointed
of.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;'Tis true, the Confederates talk
big, and have lately had a great Victo|ry,
and if Talk will beat the King
of <HI>Ebronia</HI> out of his Kingdom, he is
certainly undone, but we do not find
the <HI>Gallunarians</HI> part with any thing
they can keep, nor that they quit any
thing without Blows; It mu&s;t co&s;t a
great deal of Blood and Trea&s;ure be|fore
this War can be ended; if ab&s;olute
Conque&s;t on one &s;ide mu&s;t be the Mat|ter,
and if the De&s;ign on <HI>Ebronia</HI>
&s;hould mi&s;carry, as one Voyage thither
has done already, where are we then?
Let any Man but look back, and con|&s;ider
what a &s;orry Figure your Confe|derate
Fleet in your World had made,
<PB N="306" REF="312">
after their <HI>Andalu&s;ian Expedition,</HI> if
they had not more by Fate than Con|duct,
chopt upon a Booty at <HI>Vigo</HI> as
they came back.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;In the like condition, will this new
King come back, if he &s;hould go for a
Kingdom and &s;hould not <HI>Catch,</HI> as the
<HI>French</HI> Man call'd it. 'Tis in the Sen&s;e
of the probability of this mi&s;carriage,
that mo&s;t Men wonder at the&s;e unac|countable
Mea&s;ures, and think the
<HI>Eagles</HI> Councils look a little Wildi&s;h,
as if &s;ome of his great Men were grown
Dilirious and Whym&s;ical, that fancy'd
Crowns and Kingdoms were to come
and go, ju&s;t as the great Divan at their
Court &s;hould direct. This confu&s;ion
of Circum&s;tances has occa&s;ion'd a cer|tain
Copy of Ver&s;es to appear about
the Moon, which in our Characters
may be read as follws.&endq;</P>

He's hardly fit to fill th' <HI>Eagle's</HI> Throne,
Who gives new Crowns, and can't protect his

<P>&startq;But after all to come clo&s;er to the Point,
if I can now make it out that whate|ver
it was before, this very Practice of
declaring a &s;econd Son to be King of
<HI>Ebronia,</HI> has publickly own'd the <HI>Pro|ceedings</HI>
of the King of <HI>Gallunaria</HI> to
be Ju&s;t, and the Title of his Grand&s;on
to be much better than the Title of the
now declar'd King, what &s;hall we call
it then?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;In order to this, 'tis fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to
examine the Title of the pre&s;ent King,
and to enter into the Hi&s;tory of his
coming to the Crown, in which I &s;hall

i&s;&s;ue, and a former Renunciation
taking Place, the Succe&s;&s;ion de|volves
<PB N="308" REF="314">
on the Hou&s;e of the <HI>Eagle</HI> as be
fore, of whom the pre&s;ent <HI>Eagle</HI> is the
elde&s;t Branch.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But the late King of <HI>Ebronia,</HI> to pre|vent
the Succe&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Eagle</HI>'s Line&punc;
makes a Will, and &s;upplies the Provi&s;o
of Renunciation by Devi&s;ing, Giving, or
Bequeathing the Crown to the Grand|&s;on
of his Si&s;ter.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The King of <HI>Gallunaria</HI> in&s;i&s;ts that
this is a lawful Title to the Crown,
and &s;eizes it accordingly, in&s;tating his
Grand&s;on in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The <HI>Eagle</HI> alledges the Renunciati|on
to confirm his Title as Heir; and
as to the Will of the late King, he
&s;ays Crowns cannot de&s;cend by Gift
and tho' the late King had an undoubt|ed
Right to enjoy it him&s;elf, he had
none to give it away.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;To make the application of this Hi|&s;tory
as &s;hort as may be, I demand
then what Right has the <HI>Eagle</HI> to give
it to his &s;econd Son? If Crowns are
not to de&s;cend by Gift, he may have a
<PB N="309" REF="315">
Right to enjoy it, but can have none
to give it away, but if he has a Right
to give it away; &s;o had the former
King, and then the pre&s;ent King has a
better Title to it than the new one,
becau&s;e his Gift was Prior to this of
the <HI>Eagle.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I would be glad to &s;ee this an&s;wer'd;
and if it can't, then I Query whether
the <HI>Eagle</HI>'s Sen&s;es ought not to be que|&s;tion'd,
for &s;etting up a Title on the
very Foundation for which he quarrels
at him that is in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and &s;o con|firm
the hone&s;ty of the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or's Ti|tle
by his own Practice.?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;From the whole, I make no Scruple
to &s;ay that either the <HI>Eagle's</HI> &s;econd
Son has no Title to the Kingdom of <HI>E|bronia,</HI>
or el&s;e giving of Crowns is a
legal Practice; and if Crowns may de&s;|cend
by Gift, then has the other King
a better Title than he, becau&s;e it was
given him fir&s;t, and the <HI>Eagle</HI> has on|ly
given away what he had no Right
to, becau&s;e 'twas given away before
he had any Title to it him&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="316">
&startq;Further, the Po&s;terity of the <HI>Eagle</HI>'s
elde&s;t Son are manife&s;tly injur'd in this
Action, for Kings can no more give a|way
their Crowns from their Po&s;terity,
than from them&s;elves; if the Right be
in the <HI>Eagle,</HI> 'tis his, as he's the elde&s;t
Male Branch of the Hou&s;e of <HI>the great
Lip,</HI> not as he is <HI>Eagle,</HI> and from him
the Crown of <HI>Ebronia,</HI> by the &s;ame
Right of Devolution de&s;cends to his
Po&s;terity, and re&s;ts on the Male Line
of every elde&s;t Branch. If &s;o, no Act
of Renunciation can alter this Succe&s;|&s;ion,
for that is a Gift, and the Gift is
exploded, or el&s;e the whole Hou&s;e of
<HI>the great Lip</HI> is excluded; &s;o that let
the Argument be turn'd and twi&s;ted
never &s;o many ways, it all Centers in
this, that the pre&s;ent Per&s;on can have
no Title to the Crown of <HI>Ebronia.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If he has any Title, 'tis from the
Gift of his Father and elder Brother;
if the Gift of a Crown is no good Title,
then his Title cannot be good; If the
Gift of a Crown is a good Title, then the
Crown was given away before, and &s;o
neither he nor his Father has any Ti|tle.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="317">
&startq;Let him that can an&s;wer the&s;e Pa|radoxes
defend his Title if he can; and
what &s;hall we now &s;ay to the War in
<HI>Ebronia,</HI> only this, that they are going
to fight for the Crown of <HI>Ebronia?</HI> and
to take it away from one that has no
Right to it, to give it to one that
has a le&s;s Right than he, and 'tis to be
fear'd that if Heaven be Righteous,
'twill &s;ucceed accordingly.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The Gentlemen of Letters who have
wrote of this in our Lunar World, on
the Subject of the <HI>Gallunarians</HI> Title,
have took a great deal of Liberty in
the <HI>Eagle</HI>'s behalf, to Banter and Ri|dicule
the <HI>Gallunarian</HI> &s;ham of a Title,
as if it were a pretence too weak for a|ny
Prince to make u&s;e of, to talk of
Kings giving their Crowns by Will.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Kingdoms and Governments, &s;ays a
Learned Lunar Author, are not things of &s;uch
indifferent Value to be given away, like a
Token left for a Legacy. If any Prince has
ever given or transferr'd his Government,
it has been done by &s;olemn Act, and the Peo|ple
have been call'd to a&s;&s;ent and confirm &s;uch
Conce&s;&s;ions.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="312" REF="318">
&startq;Then the &s;ame Author goes on, to
Treat the King of <HI>Gallunaria</HI> with a
great deal of Severity, and expo&s;es his
Politicks, that he &s;hould think to put
upon the Moon with &s;o empty, &s;o weak,
&s;o ridiculous a Pretence, as the Will of
a weak Headed Prince, who neither
had a Right to give his Crown, nor a
Brain to know what he was doing,
and he laughs to think what the
King of <HI>Gallunaria</HI> would have &s;aid
to have &s;uch a dull Trick as that, put
upon him in any &s;uch Ca&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Now when we have been &s;o Witty
upon this very Article, of giving a way
the Crown to the King of <HI>Gallunaria</HI>'s
Grand&s;on, as an incongruous and ri|diculous
Thing, &s;hall we come to make
the &s;ame Incongruity be the Founda|tion
of a War?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;With what Ju&s;tice can we make a
War for a Prince who has only a good
Title, by Vertue of the &s;elf &s;ame Acti|on
which makes the Grand&s;on of his
Enemy have a bad Title.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="319">
&startq;I always thought we had a
Ju&s;t Ground to make War on <HI>Ebronia,</HI>
as we were bound &s;ay former Alliances
to a&s;&s;i&s;t the <HI>Eagle</HI> in the recovery of
it in ca&s;e of the death of the late King
of that Country.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But now the <HI>Eagle</HI> has refus'd the
Succe&s;&s;ion, and his Elde&s;t Son has re|fu&s;'d
it, I would be glad to &s;ee it
prov'd how the &s;econd Son can have a
Title, and yet the other King have no
Title.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What a &s;trange &s;ort of a Thing is
the Crown of <HI>Ebronia,</HI> that two of the
greate&s;t Princes of the Lunar World
&s;hould Fight, not who &s;hall have it,
for neither of them will accept of it,
but who &s;hall have the Power of giving
it away.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Here are four Princes refu&s;e it; the
King of <HI>Gallunaria</HI>'s Sons had a Title
in Right of their Mother, and 'twas
not the former Renunciations that
would have barr'd them, if this &s;ofter
way had not been found out; for
time was it has been pleaded on behalf
<PB N="314" REF="320">
of the elde&s;t Son of the <HI>Gallunarian</HI>
King, that his Mother could not give
away his Right before he was born.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Then the <HI>Eagle</HI> has a Right, and
under him his elde&s;t Son; and none of
all the&s;e four will accept of the Crown;
I believe all the Moon can't find four
more that would refu&s;e it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Now, tho' none of the&s;e think it
worth accepting them&s;elves, yet they
fall out about the Right of giving it
away. The King of <HI>Gallunaria</HI> will
not accept of it him&s;elf, but he gets a
Gift from the la&s;t Incumbent. This,
&s;ays the <HI>Eagle,</HI> can't be a good Title,
for the late King had no Right to make
a Deed of Gift of the Crown, &s;ince a
King is only Tennant for Life, and
Succe&s;&s;ion of Crowns either mu&s;t de|&s;cend
by a Lineal Progre&s;&s;ion in the
Right of Primogeniture, or el&s;e they
lo&s;e the Tenure, and devolve on the
People.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Now as this Argument holds good
the <HI>Eagle</HI> has an undoubted Title to
the Crown of <HI>Ebronia:</HI> But then, &s;ays
<PB N="315" REF="321">
his <HI>Eagli&s;h Maje&s;ty,</HI> I cannot accept of the
Crown my &s;elf for I am the <HI>Eagle,</HI> and
my elde&s;t Son has two Kingdoms al|ready,
and is in a fair way to be <HI>Eagle</HI>
after me, and 'tis not worth while for
him, but I have a &s;econd Son, and we
will give it him.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Now may the King of <HI>Gallunaria</HI> &s;ay,
if one Gift is good, another is good, and
ours is the fir&s;t Gift, and therefore we
will keep it; and tho' I &s;olemnly de|clare
I &s;hould be very &s;orry to &s;ee the
Crown of <HI>Ebronia</HI> re&s;t in the Hou&s;e of
the <HI>Gallunarian,</HI> becau&s;e our Trade
will &s;uffer exceedingly; yet if never &s;o
much damage were to come of it, we
ought to do Ju&s;tice in the World; if
neither the <HI>Eagle</HI> nor his elde&s;t Son will
be King of <HI>Ebronia,</HI> but a Deed of Gift
&s;hall be made, the fir&s;t Gift has the
Right, for nothing can be given away
to two People at once, and 'tis appa|rent
that the late King had as much
Right to give it away as any Body.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The poor <HI>Ebronians</HI> are in a fine Con|dition
all this while, that no Body con|cerns
them in the Matter; neither
<PB N="316" REF="322">
Party has &s;o much as thought it worth
while to ask them who they would
have to Reign over them, here has
been no A&s;&s;embly, <HI>no Cortez,</HI> no Meet|ing
of the People of <HI>Ebronia,</HI> neither
Collectively or Repre&s;entatively, no
general Convention of the Nobility,
no Hou&s;e of Feathers, but <HI>Ebronia</HI> lies
as the &s;poil of the Victor wholly pa&s;&s;ive,
and her People and Princes, as if they
were wholly unconcern'd, lie by and
look on, whoever is like to be King,
they are like to &s;uffer deeply by the
Strife, and yet neither &s;ide has thought
fit to con&s;ult them about it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The conclu&s;ion of the whole Mat|ter
is in &s;hort this, here is certainly a
a fal&s;e Step taken, how it &s;hall be recti|fy'd
is not the pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s, nor am I
Wi&s;e enough to Pre&s;cribe. One Man
may do in a Moment what all the Lu|nar
World cannot undo in an Age.
'Tis not be thought the <HI>Eagle</HI> will be
prevail'd on to undo it, nay he has
Sworn not to alter it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I am not concern'd to prove the Ti|tle
of the pre&s;ent King of <HI>Ebronia,</HI> no,
<PB N="317" REF="323">
nor of the <HI>Eagles</HI> neither; but I think
I can never be an&s;wer'd in this, that
this Gift of the <HI>Eagles</HI> to his &s;econd
Son is prepo&s;terous, incon&s;i&s;tent with
all his Claim to the Crown, and the
greate&s;t confirmation of the Title of
his Enemy that it was po&s;&s;ible to give,
and no doubt the <HI>Gallunarians</HI> will lay
hold of the Argument.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If this Prince was the <HI>Eagle's</HI> elde&s;t
Son, he might have a Ju&s;t Right from
the conce&s;&s;ion of his Father, becau&s;e
the Right being inherent, he only re|ceiv'd
from him an Inve&s;titure of Time,
but as this young Gentleman is a &s;e|cond
Son he has no more Right, his
elder Brother being alive, than your
<HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> or <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> in
your World.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Let them Fight then for &s;uch a Cau&s;e,
who valuing only the Pay, make War
a Trade, and Fight for any thing they
are bid to Fight for, and as &s;uch value
not the Ju&s;tice of the War, nor trou|ble
their Heads about Cau&s;es and Con|&s;equences,
&s;o they have their Pay, 'tis
well enough for them.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="324">
&startq;But were the Ju&s;tice of the War ex|amin'd,
I can &s;ee none, this Declar|ing
a new King who has no Right but
by a Gift, and pulling down one that
had it by a Gift before, has &s;o much
Contradiction in it, that I am afraid
no Wi&s;e Man, or Hone&s;t Man will em|bark
in it.&endq;</P>

<P>&startq;I wou'd have no Body now pre|tend

Letter, which being for the <HI>Gallunari|ans</HI>
for no <HI>Man in the Moon</HI> had more
A ver&s;ion for them than he, but he would
have had the War carry'd on upon a

had no need to go out of the Road of Ju|&s;tice,

<P><PB N="319" REF="325">

every way. The very fir&s;t Voy|age
the new King made, he had like to

&s;o much as to be able to &s;et his Foot up|on
his new Kingdom of <HI>Ebronia,</HI> but his
Adver&s;ary by wonderful Dexterity, and
the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of his old Grandfather
the <HI>Gallunarian</HI> Monarch, beat his Troops
upon all Occa&s;ions, invaded his Ally
that pretended to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, and kept
a quiet Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the va&s;t <HI>Ebronian

<P>Being very much Shockt in my Judg|ment
of this Affair, by the&s;e unan&s;wer|able
Rea&s;ons; I enquir'd of my Author
who were the Directors of this Matter?
<PB N="320" REF="326">
he told me plainly it was done by tho&s;e
great States Men, which the <HI>Solunarian</HI>
Queen had lately very Ju&s;tly turn'd out,
who&s;e Politicks were very unaccounta|ble
in a great many other things, as well
as in that.</P>
<P>'Tis true, the War was carry'd on un|der,
the new Mini&s;try, and no War in
the World can be Ju&s;ter, on account of
the Inju&s;tice and Encroachment of the

<P>The Queen therefore and her pre&s;ent
Mini&s;ters, go on with the War on Prin|ciples

of the <HI>Solunarians</HI> to beat the Invader
out, and then let the People come and
make a fair Deci&s;ion who they will have
to Reign over them.</P>
<P>This indeed ju&s;tifies the War in <HI>Ebro|nia,</HI>
to be Right, but for the Per&s;onal
Proceedure as before, 'tis all Contradi|ction
and can never be an&s;wer'd.</P>
<P>I hope no Man will be &s;o malicious, as

the Feathers.</P>
<P>I cannot omit &s;ome further Remarks here, as
1. It is to be ob&s;erv'd, that this la&s;t
Con&s;olidator was in a manner quite
worn out.&mdash;It had indeed continu'd
but 3 Year, which was the &s;tated Time

<P><PB N="323" REF="329">
Among the re&s;t of the Broils they had

the Slave began to haloo him in the

a Tacker, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and &s;o brought

<P>As this Gentleman$<HI>Feather</HI> was re&s;cud'd
with great Courte&s;ie by the <HI>Grandee,</HI> ta|ken

<P>The Fellow being call'd in, was ask't
by him who employ'd him, or &s;et him
on to offer him this In&s;ult? The Footman
being a ready bold Fellow, told him no
Body Sir, but you are all grown &s;o ri|diculous
to the whole Nation, that if
the 134 of you were le&s;t but to us Foot|men,
<PB N="324" REF="330">

our Ma&s;ters, than you, we &s;hould Cure

again, and all the People in the Moon
are of our Mind.</P>
<P>But &s;ays the <HI>Feather,</HI> why do you call
me Fool too? why Sir, &s;ays he, becau&s;e
no Body could ever tell us what it was
you drove at, and we ha' been told you
never knew your &s;elves; now if one of
you Tacking <HI>Feathers</HI> would but tell the

would be &s;atisfy'd, but to be leaders

Meaning, without Thought or De&s;ign,
mu&s;t argue your' Fools, or wor&s;e,

<P>But what if we had a meaning, &s;ays
the <HI>Feather</HI>-Man? why then, &s;ays the

and call you Knaves, for it could never
bean Hone&s;t one, &s;o that you had bet|ter

mu&s;t be to di&s;appoint all the publick Af|fairs,

putting all things backward, bring the

broke off, and we &s;hall leave it there, and
proceed to the Story.</P>
<P>The Men of the Feather as I have
noted, who are repre&s;ented here by the
<PB N="326" REF="332">
<HI>Con&s;olidator,</HI> fell all together by the Ears,
and <HI>all the Moon</HI> was in a combu&s;tion.
The Ca&s;e was as follows.</P>
<P>They had three times lo&s;t <HI>their qual|lifying
Law,</HI> and particularly they ob|&s;erv'd
the <HI>Grandees</HI> were the Men that
threw it out, and notwith&s;tanding <HI>the
Plot of the Tackers,</HI> as they call'd them,
who were <HI>as I noted,</HI> ob&s;erv'd to be in
Conjunction <HI>with the Crolians,</HI> yet the
Law always pa&s;t <HI>the Feathers,</HI> but &s;till
The <HI>Grandees</HI> qua&s;ht it.</P>
<P>To &s;how their Re&s;entment <HI>at the
Grandees,</HI> they had often made <HI>attempts
To mortify them,</HI> &s;ometimes Arraigning
them in general, &s;ometimes <HI>Impeaching
Private Members</HI> of their Hou&s;e, but &s;till
All wou'd not do, <HI>the Grandees</HI> had the
better of them, and going on with Regu|larity
and Temper, the <HI>Con&s;olidators</HI> or
Feather-Men always had the wor&s;t, <HI>the
Grandees had the applau&s;e of all the Moon</HI>
had <HI>the la&s;t Blow</HI> on every Occa&s;ion, and
the other &s;unk in their Reputation ex|ceedingly.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="333">
It is nece&s;&s;ary to under&s;tand here,
that the Men of the Feather &s;erve in &s;e|veral
Capacities, and under &s;everal De|nominations,
and <HI>act by them&s;elves,</HI> &s;ing|ly
con&s;ider'd, they are call'd <HI>the Con&s;o|lidator,</HI>
and the Feathers we mention'd
ab&s;tracted from their Per&s;ons, make the
glorious Engine we &s;peak of, and in
which, when any &s;uddain Motion takes
them, they can all &s;hut them&s;elves up,
and away for the Moon.</P>
<P>But when the&s;e are <HI>joyn'd with the
Grandees, and the Queen,</HI> &s;o United, they
make a great <HI>Cortez,</HI> or general Colle|ction
of all the Governing Authority of
the Nation.</P>
<P>When this la&s;t Fraction happen'd, the
<HI>Men of the Feather</HI> were under an exceed|ing
Ferment, they had in &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ion
taken into their Cu&s;tody, &s;ome good
Hone&s;t <HI>Lunar Country-Men,</HI> for an Of|fence,
which indeed few but them&s;elves
ever immagin'd was a Crime, for the
poor Men did nothing but pur&s;ue their
own Right by the Law.</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="334">
'Tis thought the Men of the Feather
&s;oon &s;aw they were in the Wrong, but
acted like &s;ome Men in our World, that
when they make a mi&s;take, being too
Proud to own them&s;elves in the wrong,
run them&s;elves into wor&s;e Errors to
mend it.</P>
<P>So <HI>the&s;e Lunar Gentlemen</HI> di&s;taining
to have it &s;aid they <HI>could be mi&s;taken,</HI>
committed two Errors to conceal one,
'till at la&s;t they came to be laught at by
<HI>all the Moon.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e poor Men having lain long
while in Pri&s;on, for little or no Crime, at
la&s;t were advis'd to apply them&s;elves <HI>to
the Law for Di&s;charge;</HI> the Law would fairly
have Di&s;charg'd them; for <HI>in that Coun|try,</HI>
no Man may be Impri&s;on'd, but he
mu&s;t in a certain Time be Tryed, or let
go upon Pledges of his Friends, <HI>much
like our giving Bail on a Writ of Habe as Cor|pus;</HI>
but the Judges, whether over-aw'd
by the Feathers, or what was the Cau&s;e,
Authors have not determin'd, did not
care to venture Di&s;charging them.</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="335">
The poor Men thus remanded, ap|ply'd
them&s;elves <HI>to the Grandees</HI> who
were then Sitting, and who are <HI>the Soveraign
Judicature</HI> of the Country, and
before whom Appeals lie from all Courts
of Ju&s;tice. <HI>The Grandees</HI> as in Duty
bound, appear'd ready to do them Ju|&s;tice,
but the Queen was to be apply'd
to, fir&s;t to grant a Writ, or a Warrant
for a Writ, call'd in their Country <HI>a Writ
of Follies,</HI> which is as much as to &s;ay
Mi&s;takes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Con&s;olidators</HI> fore&s;eeing the Con&s;e|quence,
immediately apply'd them&s;elves
to the Queen with an Addre&s;s, the Terms
of which were &s;o <HI>&V;ndu&mdash;l and &V;nman-ly,</HI>
that had &s;he not been a Queen of un|u&s;ual
Candor and Goodne&s;s, &s;he would
have Treated them as they de&s;erv'd, for
they upbraided her with their Freedom

expected &s;he &s;hould do as they de&s;ir'd.</P>
<P>The&s;e People that knew the Supplies

ju&s;tly provok'd to &s;ee their good Queen
&s;o barbarou&s;ly Treated.</P>
<P>The Queen full of Goodne&s;s and
Calmne&s;s, gave them a gentle kind An|&s;wer,
but told them &s;he mu&s;t be careful
to Act with due Regard to the Laws,
and could not interrupt the cour&s;e of
Judicial Proceedings; and at the &s;ame

with her Council, and receiv'd
the Opinion of all the Judges, that it
was not only Safe, but Ju&s;t and Rea&s;on|able,
and a Right to her People which
&s;he could not deny.</P>
<P>This Proceeding gall'd the Feathers to

to proceed Judicially upon the
&s;aid <HI>Writ of Follies,</HI> which if they did,
the Pri&s;oners would be deliver'd and the

&s;ent their Pour&s;uivants took them

<P>1. That the <HI>Feathers</HI> had no Right to
Claim, or make any new Priviledges for
them&s;elves, other than they had before.</P>
<P>2. That every Freeman of the Moon
had a Right to repel Injury with Law.</P>
<P>3. That Impri&s;oning the 5 Country|men
by the <HI>Feathers,</HI> was a&s;&s;uming a
new Priviledge they had no Right to, and
a &s;ubjecting the Subjects Right to their
Arbitrary Votes.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="338">
4. That a <HI>Writ of Deliverance,</HI> or re|moving
the Body, is the legal Right of
every Subject in the Moon, in order to
his Liberty, in ca&s;e of Impri&s;onment.</P>
<P>5. That to puni&s;h any Per&s;on for a&s;|&s;i&s;ting

a breach of the Laws, and a thing of

Moon.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides this, they had one &s;trange
effect, which was a prodigious di&s;ap|pointment
to the Men of the <HI>Feather.</HI></P>
<P>I had ob&s;erv'd before, that there was
to be a new Set of <HI>Feathers,</HI> provided
in order to Building another <HI>Con&s;olida|tor,</HI>
according to a late Law for a new
<PB N="333" REF="339">
Engine every three Years. Now &s;eve|ral
of the&s;e Men of the <HI>Feather,</HI> who
thought their <HI>Feathers</HI> capable of &s;erv|ing
again, had made great Intere&s;t, and
been at great Co&s;t to have their old
<HI>Feathers</HI> cho&s;en again, but the People
had entertain'd &s;uch &s;coundrel Opinions
of the&s;e Proceedings, &s;uch as Tacking,
<HI>Con&s;olidating,</HI> Impri&s;oning Electors, Im|peaching
without Tryal, <HI>Writs of
Follies</HI> and the like, that if anyone was
known to be concern'd in any of the&s;e things,
no Body would Vote for him.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen were &s;o mortify'd at
this, that even the hotte&s;t High-Church
<HI>Solunarian</HI> of them all, if he put in any
where to be re-cho&s;en, the fir&s;t thing he
had to do, was to a&s;&s;ure the People he
was no Tacker, none of the 134, and a
va&s;t deal of difficulty they had to Purge
them&s;elves of this ble&s;&s;ed Action, which
they us'd to value them&s;elves on before,
as their Glory and Merit.</P>
<P>Thus they grew a&s;ham'd of it as a
Crime, got Men to go about to vouch
for them to the Country People, that
they were no Tackers, nay, one of them
to clear him&s;elf loudly for&s;wore it, and
<PB N="334" REF="340">
taking a Gla&s;s of Wine wi&s;ht it might

<P>In like manner, one of the <HI>Feathers</HI>
for the <HI>middle Province</HI> of the Country,
who us'd to think it his Honour to be
for the qualifying Law, &s;eeing which
way the humour of the Country ran,
took as much Pains now to tell the Peo|ple
he was no Tacker, as he did before,
to promi&s;e them that he would do his
utmo&s;t to have the <HI>Crolians</HI> reduc'd, and
that Bill to pa&s;s, the Rea&s;on of which
was plain, that he &s;aw if it &s;hould be

never have his <HI>Feather</HI> return'd to be
put into the <HI>Con&s;olidator.</HI></P>
<P>The Heats and Feuds that the <HI>Fea|thers</HI>
and the <HI>Grandees</HI> were now run in|to,
began to make the latter very un|ea&s;ie,
and they &s;ent to the <HI>Grandees</HI> to
ha&s;ten them, and put them in mind of
pa&s;&s;ing &s;ome Laws they had &s;ent up to
them for rai&s;ing Mony, and which lay be|fore
<PB N="335" REF="341">
them, knowing that as &s;oon as tho&s;e
Laws were pa&s;t, the Queen would break
'em up, and they being very willing to
be gone, before the&s;e things came too
far upon the Stage, urg'd them to di&s;|patch.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Grandees</HI> re&s;olving to go
thoro' with the Matter, &s;ent to them to
come to a Treaty on the foot of the &s;ix
Articles, and to bring any Rea&s;ons they
could, to prove the Power they had to
Act as they had done with the Country|men,
and with the Lawyers they had
put in Pri&s;on for a&s;&s;i&s;ting them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Feathers</HI> were very backward
and &s;tiff about this Conference, or Trea|ty,
'till at la&s;t the <HI>Grandees</HI> having &s;uf|ficiently
expos'd them to all the Nation,
the Bills were pa&s;t, the <HI>Grandees</HI> caus'd

of their Proceedings, and
the <HI>Feathers</HI> foul Dealings to the Queen
of the Country, and &s;o her Maje&s;ty &s;ent
them Home.</P>
<P>But if they were a&s;ham'd of being call'd
Tackers before, they were doubly morti|fy'd
at this now, nay the Country re&s;ent|ed
<PB N="336" REF="342">
it &s;o exceedingly, that &s;ome of them

venture to go Home or no; Printed Li&s;ts

do not &s;ay they were true Li&s;ts, for it
was a hard thing to know which were
true Li&s;ts, and which were not, nor in|deed
could a true Li&s;t be made, no Man
being able to retain the exact Account of
who were the Men in his Memory.</P>
<P>For as there were 134 Tackers, &s;o

the&s;e, that they expre&s;s'd their
Re&s;entment upon all Occa&s;ions, and lea&s;t
the Queen &s;hould think that the Nation
approv'd the Proceedings, they drew
up a Repre&s;entation or Complaint, full of
mo&s;t dutiful Expre&s;&s;ions to their Queen,
and full of Re&s;entment again&s;t the <HI>Fea|thers,</HI>

<P>It was always my Opinion in Affairs

immediately, and <HI>down with them.</HI>&mdash;
Nay &s;ome were for falling on them di|rectly,
without the formality of declar|ing
War.</P>
<P>Others, more afraid than hurt, cry'd
out Inva&s;ions, Depredation, Fire and
Sword, the Northern Men would be
upon them immediately, and propos'd
to Fortify their Frontiers, and file off
their Forces to the Borders; nay, &s;o ap|prehen&s;ive
did tho&s;e Men of Prudence
pretend to be, that they order'd Towns
to be Fortify'd 100 <HI>Mile off of the Place,</HI>
when all this while the poor Northern

were &s;o aver&s;e, and always talk't cold|ly
of the fighting Part, and tho' the
Northern Men call'd it fear, yet I can|not
joyn with them in that, for <HI>to fear</HI>
requires Thinking; and &s;ome of our <HI>So|lunarians</HI>
are ab&s;olutely protected from
the fir&s;t, becau&s;e they never meddle
with the la&s;t, <HI>except when they come to the
Engine,</HI> and therefore 'tis plain it could
not proceed from Fear.</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="350">
It has puzzl'd' the mo&s;t di&s;cerning
Heads of the Age, to give a Rea&s;on
from whence this Aver&s;ion proceeded,
and various Judgments have been gi|ven
of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Nolunarians</HI> je&s;ted with them, and
when they talk't of Fighting, bad them
look back into Hi&s;tory, and examine
what they ever made of a <HI>Nolunarian
War,</HI> and whether they had not been
often well beaten and &s;ent &s;hort home,
bid them have a care of <HI>catching a Tar|tar,</HI>
as we call it, and always made
them&s;elves merry with it.</P>
<P>They banter'd the <HI>Solunarians</HI> too, a|bout
the Fears an Terrors they were
under, from their Arming them&s;elves,
and putting them&s;elves in a po&s;ture of
Defence,&mdash;When it was ea&s;y to &s;ee by
the nature of the thing, that their De|&s;ign
was <HI>not a War but a &V;nion</HI> upon
ju&s;t Conditions, that it was a plain
Token that they de&s;ign'd either to put
&s;ome affront upon <HI>the Nolunarians,</HI> to
deny them &s;ome ju&s;t Claims, or to im|po&s;e
&s;omething very Provoking upon
them more than they had yet done, that
<PB N="345" REF="351">
they were &s;o exceeding fearful of an In|va&s;ion
from them.</P>
<P>Tho' the&s;e were &s;ufficient to pa&s;s for
Rea&s;ons in other Ca&s;es, yet it could not
be &s;o here, but I &s;aw there mu&s;t be &s;ome|thing
el&s;e in it. As I was thus wondering
at this unu&s;ual backwardne&s;s of the Soul|diers,
I enquir'd a little farther into the
meaning of it, and quickly found the Rea|&s;on
was plain, <HI>there was nothing to be got
by it,</HI> that People were <HI>Brave, De&s;perate</HI>
and <HI>Poor,</HI> the Country <HI>Barren,</HI> Moun|tainous
and <HI>Empty,</HI> &s;o that in &s;hort there
would be nothing but Blows, and <HI>Soul|diers
Fellows</HI> to be had, and I always ob|&s;erv'd
that Souldiers never care to be
knockt on the Head, and get nothing by
the Bargain.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I &s;aw plainly the Rea&s;ons
that prompted the <HI>Solunarians</HI> to In&s;ult
their Neighbours of the North, were
more deriv'd from the regret at their
E&s;tabli&s;hing <HI>Croliani&s;m,</HI> than at any
real Cau&s;es they had given, or indeed
were in a condition to give them.</P>
<P>The&s;e, and abundance more particu|lar
<PB N="346" REF="352">
Ob&s;ervations I made, but as I left
the thing &s;till in agitation, and unde|termin'd,
I &s;hall refer it to another Voy|age
which I purpo&s;e to make thither,
and at my return, may perhaps &s;et that
Ca&s;e in a clearer Light than our Sight
can yet bear to look at it in.</P>
<P>If in my &s;econd Voyage I &s;hould un|deceive
People in the Notions they en|tertain'd
of tho&s;e Northern People, and
convince them that the <HI>Solunarians</HI>
were really the Aggre&s;&s;ors, and had put
great hard&s;hips upon them, I might
po&s;&s;ibly do a Work, that if it met with
Encouragement, might bring the <HI>Solu|narians</HI>
to do them Ju&s;tice, and that
would &s;et all to Rights, the two Nations
might ea&s;ily become one, and Unite for
ever, or at lea&s;t become Friends, and
give mutual A&s;&s;i&s;tance to each other;
and I cannot but own &s;uch an Agreement
would make them both very formida|ble,
but this I refer to another time.&mdash;</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time I cannot leave it with|out
a Remark that this Jealou&s;y between
the two Nations, may perhaps in future A|ges
be nece&s;&s;ary to be maintain'd, in order
<PB N="347" REF="353">
to find &s;ome better Rea&s;ons for <HI>Fortifi|cations,
Standing Armies, Guards and
Gari&s;ons</HI> than could be given in the
Reign of the great Prince I &s;peak of, the
Queen's Predece&s;&s;or, tho' his was again&s;t
a Forreign in&s;ulting Enemy.</P>
<P>But the Temper of the <HI>Solunarian High
Party</HI> was always &s;uch, that they would
with much more ea&s;e give thanks for a
Standing Army again&s;t the <HI>Nolunarians
and Crolians,</HI> than agree to one Legion
again&s;t the <HI>Abrogratzians</HI> and <HI>Galluna|rians.</HI></P>
<P>But of the&s;e Things I am al&s;o promis'd
a more particular Account upon my
Journy into that Country.</P>
<P>I cannot however conclude this Mat|ter,
without giving &s;ome Account of my
private Ob&s;ervations, upon what was
farther to be &s;een in this Country.</P>
<P>And had not my Remarks on their
State Matters taken up more of my
Thoughts than I expected, I might have
entred a little upon their other Affairs,
&s;uch as their <HI>Companies,</HI> their <HI>Commerce,</HI>
<PB N="348" REF="354">
their <HI>Publick Offices,</HI> their <HI>Stock-Jobbers</HI>
their <HI>Temper,</HI> their <HI>Conver&s;ation,</HI> their
<HI>Woman,</HI> their <HI>Stages, &V;niver&s;ities,</HI> their
<HI>Courtiers,</HI> their <HI>Clergy,</HI> and the Chara|cters
of <HI>the &s;everals</HI> under all the&s;e De|nominations,
but the&s;e mu&s;t be referr'd
to time, and my more perfect Ob&s;erva|tions.</P>
<P>But I cannot omit, that tho' have
very little Knowledge of Books, and
had obtain'd le&s;s upon their Language,
yet I could not but be very inqui&s;itive
after their Libraries and Men of Let|ters.</P>
<P>Among their Libraries I found not
abundance of their own Books, their
Learning having &s;o much of De|mon&s;tration,
and being very Hierogly|phical,
but I found to my great Admi|ration
va&s;t quantities of Tran&s;lated
Books out of all Languages of our
World.</P>
<P>As I thought my &s;elf one of the fir&s;t,
at lea&s;t of our Nation, that ever came
thus far; it was, you may be &s;ure no &s;mall
&s;urprize to me, to find all the mo&s;t val|luable

our Tongue, into the Lunar Dialect,
and &s;tor'd up in their Libraries with the
Remarks, Notes and Ob&s;ervations of
the Learned Men of that Climate upon
the Subject.</P>
<P>Here, among a va&s;t croud of <HI>French</HI>

for trifling, came a huge Volume con|taining,
<HI>Les Oevres de &s;cavans,</HI> which
has 19 &s;mall Bells painted upon the
Book of &s;everal di&s;proportion'd &s;izes.</P>
<P>I enquir'd the meaning of that Hiero|glyphick,
which the Ma&s;ter of the Books
told me, was to &s;ignify that the &s;ub|&s;tance
was all Jingle and Noi&s;e, and
that of 30 Volumes which that one
Book contains, 29 of them have neither
Sub&s;tance, Mu&s;ick, Harmony nor value
in them.</P>
