<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IT</HI> is cu&s;tomary to write prefaces to books, either to a&s;&s;ign the rea&s;ons of the publicati|on, or the value of the performance; neither of the&s;e are intended by this preface. The rea&s;ons of publication men may imagine for them&s;elves, and would do &s;o although they were expre&s;sly told: The merit of the di&s;cour&s;es every one may judge of al&s;o, according as they under&s;tand them. Liberty is the profe&s;&s;ed principles of the <HI>Author;</HI> this he would chu&s;e to have to him&s;elf, and give to every one; and at the &s;ame time he would not willingly offend any. What &s;entiments may be in the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es, different from any other man's opinion, the <HI>Author</HI> claims his own liberty for &s;peaking them, and will never blame others for doing the &s;ame. He is far from intending to differ from any, in &s;up|porting true and undefiled religion, and profe&s;&s;es to &s;upport every worthy character of every denomination. What &s;ociety he ever &s;hall be connected with, he will endeavour to &s;upport, without any per&s;ons hurt; and &s;till &s;eek peace,
<PB N="ii" REF="3">and pur&s;ue it with all chri&s;tians. The cau&s;e and character of his Brethren, he accounts his duty and intere&s;t to &s;upport; for that rea&s;on, he ever &s;hall &s;tudy to guard again&s;t what may offend them in every indifferent thing.</P>
<P>The love and fellow&s;hip of all good men he will ever value, and will not quarrel with them for difference in judgment. Whatever names the ill-natured world may give them, it is no|thing to the author, he judgeth for him&s;elf; and why may not every one el&s;e? The reproachful names of <HI>Arian, Socinian, Arminian,</HI> are, in his opinion, rather words of cour&s;e, than any words of &s;ignification. Every malicious man gives them to tho&s;e they do not love, becau&s;e they know the common people hate the very &s;ound of them. What <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aid of idols may be &s;aid of the&s;e, <HI>An idol is nothing, but as men con|&s;ider it;</HI> and on all the&s;e things, as many men, as many minds. Why not then love all whom we &s;ee evidence religion in their lives and conduct, and leave God to judge their faith and opinions. The&s;e di&s;cour&s;es the <HI>Author</HI> recom|mends to every &s;erious reader, to con&s;ider with candour, and cen&s;ure after as he plea&s;eth. The <HI>Author</HI>'s name and character is not worthy of any e&s;teem in the world, he is willing to offer it a &s;acrifice for His honour, who made him&s;elf of no reputation for the &s;ake of &s;inners. Popula|rity is what the <HI>Author</HI> neither &s;eeks nor re|gards; or if he did, there are &s;undry pa&s;&s;ages in the&s;e &s;ermons would fru&s;trate his intentions.
<PB N="iii" REF="4">To plea&s;e he ever intends, but de&s;pi&s;eth all po|pularity but what is hone&s;t and &s;incere, and con&s;i&s;tent with truth and goodwill to others. In fine, what is here pre&s;ented to the public, are &s;ermons delivered to a Di&s;&s;enting congregation, for their edification; and that they may edify, is the &s;incere wi&s;h of,</P>
<P><HI>The AUTHOR.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SERMON I. Revelation &s;et in Oppo&s;ition to En|thu&s;ia&s;m.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>2 TIM. iii. xvi.</HI></BIBL>
<P>All Scripture is given by In&s;piration of God, and is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for In&s;truction in Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_AS the foundation of the Chri&s;tian faith, and all the rules of the Chri&s;tian practice, are contained in the Holy Scriptures, it is nece&s;&s;ary in order to have a well ground|ed faith, and regular conver&s;ation, to under&s;tand the author, nature, and meaning of the Holy Ora|cles. <HI>Timothy,</HI> that he might both be a &s;trong &s;aint, and an able mini&s;ter of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> is ex|horted by St <HI>Paul</HI> to give him&s;elf wholly to the &s;tudy of the Scriptures. This exhortation is en|forced from the authority and u&s;efulne&s;s of the Scriptures them&s;elves, and the great end propo&s;ed to a &s;teady adherence to religion.</P>
<P>THE Apo&s;tle lays it down as the be&s;t antidote again&s;t error and mi&s;take in either faith or practice, to be well grounded in the knowledge of the Holy Scriptures: and indeed without an under&s;tanding of, and faith in, divine revelation, error and here&s;y are unavoidable. Our Saviour tells the <HI>Sadducees</HI> that they erred, not knowing the Scriptures; and all the mi&s;takes among the different per&s;ua&s;ions of Chri&s;tians proceed from the &s;ame &s;ource of igno|rance. The Scriptures of the Old and New Te&s;|tament
<PB N="4" REF="8">are the only rule to direct men how they are to glorify God, and enjoy him. In the days of the apo&s;tle, the &s;criptures of the Old Te&s;tament were the foundation of faith and practice to the church then: To the&s;e he &s;eems &s;pecially to re|fer, in our text in his advice to <HI>Timothy;</HI> but to the church now, both Old and New Te&s;taments are intended for the &s;ame purpo&s;e: The&s;e al&s;o are given to be the foundation of our confidence in God and the rule of our duty.</P>
<P>To open up in as few words as po&s;&s;ible, the meaning and de&s;ign of the apo&s;tle in the text, I pro|po&s;e,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. To explain the nature of in&s;piration when applied to the &s;cripture.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Shew that all things nece&s;&s;ary to be believed in matters of faith, and per|formed in matters of practice, are contained in the&s;e dictates of divine in&s;piration.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Shew that no|thing can be added to the&s;e holy oracles.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. De|mon&s;trate that the &s;criptures are the only &s;tandard to judge of all new di&s;coveries by. Then make &s;ome improvement of the &s;ubject.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. As to things never before revealed, that are prophetically declared in the &s;cripture, which con|tained either mercies to be be&s;towed, or judgments to happen, the in&s;piration con&s;i&s;ted in the &s;pirit's &s;ugge&s;ting to the mind of the in&s;pired per&s;on, an exact picture or draught of what was to come to pa&s;s. This was &s;ometimes done in dreams by night, or in exta&s;ies and vi&s;ions in the day time, as was the ca&s;e of <HI>Ezekiel</HI> and <HI>Daniel,</HI> and others of the pro|phets. This was not a &s;udden tran&s;ient fancy that went off in a moment, like many of men's ordinary dreams and nocturnal vi&s;ions, that can no more be ac|counted for when they are over; but a la&s;ting impre&s;|&s;ion upon the mind of the in&s;pired per&s;on, whereby they could recapitulate, in every circum&s;tance, a long time after, the whole of what had been revealed.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="9">
<P>JEREMIAH could, after the fir&s;t roll was burnt, repeat the &s;ame over-again to <HI>Baruch,</HI> which &s;hews the impre&s;&s;ion of what was revealed remained &s;till upon his mind. Moral truths, which were either grounds of faith or rules of duty, were in like man|ner &s;ugge&s;ted to the mind of the in&s;pired per&s;on; and the lively types thereof often remained for a long time after upon their imagination. The&s;e moral truths evidenced them&s;elves to be of divine original, from their &s;imilitude to the nature of God; and the&s;e ideas a rational being will readily conceive of Him. The in&s;pired per&s;on's mi&s;&s;ion to publi&s;h and teach the&s;e doctrines, was confirmed by mira|culous &s;igns and wonders, which were performed beyond what is in the power of human nature to effect. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> performed many notable miracles to confirm his mi&s;&s;ion, to publi&s;h and teach his laws and doctrine to the children of <HI>I&s;rael:</HI> And our Saviour al&s;o did many things that evidenced his divine mi&s;|&s;ion, that he came from God, and that his doctrine was true: For a ruler of the Jews confe&s;s'd, <HI>that no Man could do &s;uch things unle&s;s God was with him.</HI> The mo&s;t certain and infallible evidence at|tended the whole of the&s;e revelations, that frequent|ly the very cour&s;e of nature was changed to confirm the certainty thereof. The dead were rai&s;ed; the blind received their &s;ight; the dumb &s;pake; the lepers were clean&s;ed. What was foretold by pro|phecy was al&s;o fulfilled, at lea&s;t as much as is &s;uffi|cient to convince us that the re&s;t will be accom|pli&s;hed.</P>
<P>THE &s;criptures are the dictates of divine in&s;pira|tion, in as much as the Holy Spirit drew the ori|ginal types of all the&s;e truths, moral or prophetical, which now &s;tand in the &s;acred volumes. As &s;uf|ficient evidence attended this in&s;piration, &s;o we may re&s;t &s;atisfied that it came from God, It would have
<PB N="6" REF="10">been un&s;afe for the church of God to have depend|ed upon the certainty of this revelation, unle&s;s &s;uf|ficient evidence had attended it: But God at &s;undry times and divers manners confirmed the&s;e truths; he ordered his prophets and &s;ervants to write, by appending his own &s;eal to the&s;e &s;acred enunciations, which in other ca&s;es was never heard of. Hence the &s;criptures are no uncertain dreams of di&s;ordered minds, but an in&s;piration of God's &s;pirit for the hap|pine&s;s of men. But here it may be ob&s;erved, that in&s;piration was never properly intended as the im|mediate means of conver&s;ion to tho&s;e that were in|&s;pired, but to qualify them to fulfil that important tru&s;t and office God had called them unto. It mu&s;t therefore follow of con&s;equence, that this divine in|&s;piration was not a nece&s;&s;ary converting mean to every one that was in&s;pired, otherwi&s;e all in&s;pired per&s;ons &s;hould have been converted, and that none of the prophets were converted till they were in|&s;pired, which is contrary to plain &s;cripture evidence. The &s;criptures afford us in&s;tances of per&s;ons that never were converted, that yet had the &s;pirit of in&s;pi|ration, &s;uch as <HI>Balaam,</HI> and the High Prie&s;t that foretold the nece&s;&s;ity of our Saviour's death.</P>
<P>IF in&s;piration be the proper infallible evidence of conver&s;ion, <HI>Balaam</HI> and this High Prie&s;t de&s;erve a place in the callender of the &s;aints: For the one &s;aw the vi&s;ions of God, falling into a trance, having his eyes opened; and the other prophe&s;ied of a very remarkable and intere&s;ting event, which according|ly came to pa&s;s. Moreover, except the apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> the &s;acred records inform us of none that were converted by vi&s;ions and extraordinary re|velations: And the&s;e were not &s;o much de&s;igned for his conver&s;ion, as to confirm him by an extra|ordinary evidence, of the&s;e truths that were at that
<PB N="7" REF="11">time the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to be vindicated, namely, the re&s;urrection and a&s;cen&s;ion of <HI>Je&s;us:</HI> And as this apo&s;tle was called to a very weighty and important work, to preach the death and re&s;urrection of the Son of God to &s;uch as had the &s;tronge&s;t prejudices again&s;t &s;uch doctrines, it was nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould be able, upon the &s;ure&s;t grounds to &s;ay, he was not behind the very chiefe&s;t of the apo&s;tles, becau&s;e he had &s;een the Lord.</P>
<P>HAD in&s;piration, &s;ugge&s;tion, and vi&s;ion, been nece&s;&s;ary marks of regeneration, then none of the prophets could have been &s;aid to be converted till they were called to prophe&s;y, and in&s;pired with fit|ne&s;s for their office, which is contrary to expre&s;s &s;crip|ture te&s;timony. <HI>Jeremiah</HI> and <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI> were &s;anctified from the womb, but neither of them were in&s;pired with a divine impul&s;e to prophe&s;y and preach from the time they were born. The&s;e divine movements of the Holy Spirit, in an extra|ordinary manner, were peculiarly de&s;igned to in|&s;pire the&s;e penmen of &s;acred writ, or to conduct the church in receiving or rejecting what was or what was not canonical. When the de&s;igned mea&s;ure of moral truths, relating to men's faith and practice, was filled up; and the number of prophecies to be ful|filled, or promi&s;es to be performed were compleat|ed, the gift of in&s;piration cea&s;ed: When the canon of &s;cripture was fini&s;hed and received, in&s;piration with the power of working miracles came to a period.</P>
<P>THOUGH indeed for a long time after, preten|&s;ions to in&s;piration and the power to work miracles was claimed by &s;ome, and fal&s;e and counterfeit mi|racles and in&s;pirations were impo&s;ed upon the world, yet none of them were &s;upported with &s;ufficient evidence, and were in time found out to be &s;puri|ous:
<PB N="8" REF="12">They wanted that evidence to &s;upport them that was nece&s;&s;ary, and what the true oracles had; and &s;o fell under di&s;credit as the other gained re|putation.</P>
<P>IT is plain from the nature of the thing, that in|&s;piration was temporary, and not always to be con|tinued in the church. In ordinary ca&s;es the divine proceedings are according to ordinary rules, and as neither the pre&s;ent nor &s;ome preceding times require &s;uch gifts, experience bears witne&s;s that they have been laid a&s;ide. Whatever things may be &s;ugge&s;ted to men's minds now, are no further to be regarded than they can be reduced to ordi|nary rules laid down in &s;cripture: For if any man now pretend to what is extraordinary, the world has a ju&s;t claim to demand evidence in-pro|portion to his high preten&s;ions. We find the mo&s;t eminent work of God in the primitive times, in converting &s;inners, a&s;cribed to the ordinary means of preaching the go&s;pel, attended with the divine power of the Holy Gho&s;t, which pierced the hearts of guilty &s;inners, and made them cry out, <HI>What &s;hall we do to be &s;aved?</HI> But we have no account that all the&s;e converts were in&s;pired with gifts like the a|po&s;tles, nor do we at all find any more notice taken of the far greate&s;t part of them, but that they were converted and baptized. Divine revelation men|tions no in&s;piration on the part of the&s;e converts, and yet a&s;&s;ures us they were converted, though they &s;aw no vi&s;ion, nor heard any voice from heaven. There was here no in&s;piration properly &s;o called, or any types or images of things imprinted upon the minds of the&s;e converts, as la&s;ting patterns, or rules; but the whole of this work is reduced to the ordinary &s;tandard of faith and repentance, before taught in the &s;criptures. The apo&s;tles, <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> the in&s;truments of this work, were indeed in|&s;pired
<PB N="9" REF="13">by the Holy Gho&s;t, but this converted mul|titude were not &s;o in&s;pired; nothing was &s;ugge&s;ted to them at their conver&s;ion, but what was already contained in the law and the te&s;timony as duty and promi&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. INSPIRATION con&s;i&s;ted in that infallible di|rection wherewith the in&s;pired writers were conduct|ed in relating matters of fact. This was not any impre&s;&s;ion of the types and images of things upon the imagination of tho&s;e in&s;pired per&s;ons, but a powerful a&s;&s;i&s;tance given them, whereby they &s;et down what they &s;aw and heard without prejudice. The Holy Spirit &s;o directed them that they wrote nothing hi&s;torical but what they were &s;ure was fact, and what they had from the be&s;t authority; nor em|braced any report, however plau&s;ible, without &s;uf|ficient evidence that it was true. This in&s;piration was not an impre&s;&s;ion of all the words and idioms be|longing to the &s;ubject to be written, or delivered upon the imagination or fancy, but a wi&s;e direct|ing power, that guided the writer in the right u&s;e of hi&s;torical evidence. It was impo&s;&s;ible for all the cunning of impo&s;ture to deceive them, or the in|fluence of &s;ecular advantage to prejudice them, or the force of human tyranny to deter them from writing or telling the truth.</P>
<P>THE Spirit of God afforded them &s;ufficient knowledge of the &s;ubject they were to write, and brought to their mind what he intended for the good of his church: But they were not always at the &s;ame time directed by vi&s;ion and preternatural phaenomena, nor was this at all times nece&s;&s;ary to denominate them in&s;pired; for the right u&s;e of or|dinary means by the infallible direction of the &s;pi|rit, was &s;ufficient to guide the &s;acred amanuen&s;es in declaring or writing matters of fact. The &s;pirit
<PB N="10" REF="14">only directed their rea&s;on to draw ju&s;t inferences from what was made known unto them. This was a direction in judgment, whereby they were en|abled to under&s;tand what was be&s;t &s;uited for the purpo&s;e intended, and make the be&s;t u&s;e of it. The apo&s;tles were directed in writing their epi&s;tles to the churches, to chu&s;e what was mo&s;t proper for them, and mo&s;t univer&s;ally u&s;eful for all future periods; but in doing this they collated all the accounts and circum&s;tances of the&s;e churches, and u&s;ed the mo&s;t rational arguments to convince them of the truth, and admini&s;tred the mo&s;t &s;uitable reproofs to bring them back from error, or guard them a|gain&s;t it. The Divine Spirit &s;o directed them to teach and write, that all their adver&s;aries were not able to confute their arguments, nor deny the facts they narrated. A being freed from all partiality in favour of party or &s;ect, was a &s;pecial branch of their in&s;piration.</P>
<P>THE Holy Gho&s;t &s;o guided the&s;e &s;acred writers that they were no more attached to one per&s;on or thing than another, as to what they &s;aid or wrote about them, but told what was true; becau&s;e they were certain it was &s;o. And as the Spirit moved them to pub|li&s;h the&s;e truths and facts, &s;o he conducted then all along to keep by the &s;ame. In no one thing were they left to follow their own judgment, as to the truth it&s;elf; but as it was given them by &s;ufficient evidence, &s;o they kept &s;trictly by it in all their public declarations. The concord and agree|ment of their various writings, though done at different times and different places, abundantly bear witne&s;s that they were under the direction of the &s;ame unerring &s;pirit, as to what they taught and a&s;&s;erted.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="15">
<P><HI>Head</HI> 2d. To &s;hew that all things to be believed in matters of faith, and performed in matters of practice, are contained in the Holy Scrip|tures.</P>
<P N="1">1. THIS will appear from God's moral character as the author of the &s;acred oracles. As a God of perfect truth and holine&s;s, he hath given a revelation of him&s;elf, in his attributes and de&s;igns to his church. He hath &s;et forth there, both what he is and what he will be to them that &s;erve him: His character there is that he is a holy, true, good and ju&s;t be|ing; and as all the e&s;&s;ential principles of good|ne&s;s, ju&s;tice and truth, are contained in this reve|lation, as al&s;o all the &s;uitable means for the right improvement of them, and motives to engage them in a free voluntary exerci&s;e of virtue and religion; &s;o every thing el&s;e as a &s;tandard of faith, or rule of life, mu&s;t be &s;uperceded.</P>
<P>IT would be a darkening of God's moral cha|racter, as the author of &s;uch a revelation, to &s;up|po&s;e any other was nece&s;&s;ary, or could be &s;o, when all things worthy of a perfect fir&s;t cau&s;e to render him&s;elf amiable, and his rea&s;onable creatures happy, are contained in this copy of his revealed will. To find fault with this revelation, is even to de&s;troy the fir&s;t principles of natural religion; for if to view the Deity in the works and operations of his hands, in a manner becoming his glory as a perfect cau&s;e, be binding upon us by the law of nature, certainly this law of nature obliges us to believe what he &s;ays, as well as to view re&s;pectively what he hath wrought. If God's moral character, &s;hining but darkly in his works, obliges every rea&s;onable creature to fear and reverence him; much more does the clear di&s;covery of his mind in the holy &s;criptures bind them to rule their faith and practice by this revelation. If
<PB N="12" REF="16">in the &s;criptures there be pure precepts and rules to conduct men to true happine&s;s, as the like cannot be found in any other &s;y&s;tem, it mu&s;t be a reflec|tion upon God's moral character to &s;eek any other revelation. And if we add to this, that the fulle&s;t promi&s;es for our encouragement, in our attempts to do any duty, are contained in the &s;criptures, it mu&s;t in all re&s;pects be perfect for a ground of faith and rule of duty.</P>
<P>SEEING he hath given us a compleat &s;y&s;tem of all things needful for our &s;alvation in the &s;criptures, it is a reflection upon his moral character, as the benevolent Saviour of his people, and the wi&s;e and gentle benefactor of all his creatures, not wholly to depend upon it. If the &s;criptures be a revelation from God, if he hath therein bounded all future di&s;|coveries in religion, and made the&s;e the rule for us to judge by, then this mu&s;t be according to his character, for he can do nothing unbecoming him|&s;elf, which certainly would be the ca&s;e if he impo|&s;ed an imperfect &s;y&s;tem of religion upon men. If God's moral character be perfect, &s;o mu&s;t the &s;crip|tures be, of which he is the author, and cannot injure the one without hurting the other.</P>
<P N="2">2. This will appear when it is con&s;idered that all that is good, beautiful, amiable and delightful, is &s;ummed up in this book of divine revelation: And what is reckoned the excellency of natural religion, is better di&s;played in revelation than in any other &s;y&s;tem. Be&s;ides many things nece&s;&s;ary for our &s;u|preme happine&s;s are revealed in the &s;acred oracles, that never were nor could be di&s;covered by natural religion, nor by any means what&s;oever, but by a re|velation from God. The whole &s;cheme of re|demption by a crucified Saviour, is and could be brought to light only by that divine di&s;covery in
<PB N="13" REF="17">the &s;criptures; for life and immortality is only brought to light by the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>THESE doctrines, nece&s;&s;ary to e&s;tabli&s;h the hap|pine&s;s of all who tru&s;t in God through a Redeemer, are contained in the &s;criptures, and expre&s;s all that can be accounted amiable and delightful. A di&s;|play of all God's moral attributes, with the true way how to imitate them, and how men may be acceptable unto God are clearly di&s;played and &s;et forth in the &s;criptures. If revelation contain all that is morally good and graciou&s;ly free, nothing el&s;e can be the only rule to direct us, how we may glorify God and enjoy him for ever.</P>
<P N="3">3. THIS will appear if we view &s;ome of the &s;pe|cial doctrines, which are contained in the book of God relating to faith and obedience. God's being reconciled to men through a new method of his own devi&s;ing, is &s;et before us as the foundation of our faith in the holy oracles: That God was in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> reconciling the world unto him&s;elf, not im|puting their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es unto them, is a peculiar doc|trine of revelation. As all the perfections of God are &s;ome way connected with this method of grace and faith, therein is our &s;atisfaction. With that method of God's illu&s;trating his attributes, nothing in matters of a divine faith can be conceived with|out the bounds of &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem, where the whole grounds of true tru&s;t in God is comprehended.</P>
<P>THAT the &s;criptures comprehend the doctrine of reconciliation by <HI>Je&s;us</HI> is very plain to every one who read them without prejudice: That all the di|vine attributes are fully di&s;played in this &s;cheme is equally clear from &s;cripture. As our faith and confidence cannot warrantably go beyond what God hath revealed to us of him&s;elf, in the&s;e attributes and relations he hath di&s;played in the method of re|conciliation, &s;o this revelation mu&s;t be profitable
<PB N="14" REF="18">for all the grounds of faith: For true faith is only an acceptation of God our Saviour, and a tru&s;ting in him according to the&s;e relations he &s;tands in to men as revealed in the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>IF therefore all the&s;e relations be revealed and o|pened up in the &s;criptures, all that is profitable for faith mu&s;t be &s;o likewi&s;e. The doctrine of obedi|ence is al&s;o clearly revealed in the &s;criptures, both the rea&s;on and rule of our obedience are contained there. The rule of our obedience is very clear and plain in the ten commandments of the moral law; the&s;e pre&s;ent every rational creature with the pure&s;t and exacte&s;t rules of conduct. Nothing is con|tained in the&s;e holy mandates but what is good in it&s;elf, and tends to the happine&s;s of men. The &s;o|cial di&s;po&s;ition is recommended in the plaine&s;t and cleare&s;t manner, in the very &s;um of the law given by the lawgiver him&s;elf, <HI>Thou &s;halt love thy neigh|bour as thy&s;elf. The law of the Lord is perfect,</HI> &s;ays the P&s;almi&s;t. If we view the law of God in its full extent, as comprehending both the rule and rea&s;on of our obedience, angels are not yet come to the full degree of obedience, nor never will. But by ob&s;erving the&s;e ble&s;&s;ed rules men mo&s;t re&s;emble the divine nature, and render them&s;elves more ami|able in the pure eye of the Almighty; for the more of his own image God beholds in the &s;ouls of his rea&s;onable creatures, the better he is plea&s;ed with them.</P>
<P>THE rea&s;ons of our obedience are al&s;o revealed in &s;cripture; God is our Lord, and we are command|ed to wor&s;hip him: He is our Saviour and we &s;hould love him. I &s;aid before that angels will never walk up to the rea&s;ons of obedience, con|tained in divine revelation: And indeed unle&s;s that a finite nature could render as much love and &s;er|vice as an infinite being is capable of, it is impo&s;|&s;ible
<PB N="15" REF="19">they can. But the rea&s;ons are weightier on our part; he is not only our creator and bountiful benefactor, but be is al&s;o our &s;aviour and redeemer. We have greater expre&s;&s;ions of his love to us &s;et down in divine revelation, than even cherubims can boa&s;t of. The P&s;almi&s;t lo&s;t him&s;elf in meditating upon the rea&s;ons of obedience laid down in the word of God, and exemplified in his providence, P&s;al. cxvi. 12. <HI>What &s;hall I render to the Lord for all his benefits towards me? I will ble&s;s the Lord at all times, his prai&s;e &s;hall be continually in my mouth.</HI> P&s;al. xxxiv. 1. To view all the rea&s;ons of the chri&s;|tian obedience, would be to trace all the in&s;tances of divine goodne&s;s recorded in &s;cripture, together with all the excellencies of his nature there, beau|tifully di&s;played.</P>
<P>IT may not perhaps be unnece&s;&s;ary to explain a little more, particularly what we are to under&s;tand by doctrine as here expre&s;&s;ed in the text. It may comprehend all that lies within <HI>Timothy</HI>'s commi&s;&s;ion to teach the <HI>Ephe&s;ians,</HI> or what mini&s;ters of the go&s;|pel in &s;ucceeding periods are to in&s;truct &s;inners in. The depravity of human nature, the inability of falling man to recover him&s;elf, are doctrines clearly taught in &s;cripture. This is taught by the prophet <HI>Ho&s;ea, O I&s;rael, thou ha&s;t de&s;troyed thy&s;elf! But in me is thy help.</HI> The doctrine of in&s;piration expo&s;es to view the degeneracy of all men from the truth: For <HI>So|lomon</HI> tells us, <HI>There is none righteous, no not one;</HI> and the Apo&s;tle, <HI>That all fle&s;h have become guilty before God.</HI> Nothing is more in&s;i&s;ted upon in holy writ than the imperfection of human nature. Be&s;ides this doctrine opens up to &s;inners the mi&s;ery of their condition; that they are under the cur&s;e, and ex|po&s;ed to divine wrath and indignation. This doc|trine is plain and free of flattery, it does not &s;peak peace when there is none; it deals openly and free|ly
<PB N="16" REF="20">with men's polluted and mi&s;erable &s;tate; it &s;ets the gla&s;s before them and &s;hews them their picture to the life. The di&s;pen&s;ation of free grace through a Saviour, and his righteou&s;ne&s;s alone for &s;alvation; is clearly opened up in this doctrine of divine in|&s;piration. Here it is that we are informed that we are not &s;aved by works of righteou&s;ne&s;s which we have done, <HI>But according to the divine mercy which is &s;hed on us abundantly through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Saviour.</HI> In like manner the renovation of the mind by the grace of the Holy Spirit, is pointed expre&s;sly in this divine doctrine. In order to our entering into the kingdom of God we mu&s;t be born again: For our Saviour tells us, <HI>Unle&s;s a man be born again, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God,</HI> John iii. 3. Moreover all the means of this great and wonderful work of &s;alvation, are contained, as to their authority, in this heavenly doctrine. The preaching of the go&s;pel, &s;acraments and prayer, are all doctrinally taught in the &s;criptures: Not only &s;o, but who are to teach them mini&s;terially, and after what manner is expre&s;sly taught in the&s;e oracles of truth. By the &s;criptures we are in&s;tructed in all the nece&s;&s;ary connexions and di&s;tinctions of things and offices: Thereby we come to know what is the divine will concerning every &s;pecial office and ordi|nance, how far &s;uch an office and ordinance are morally connected. We learn from the holy oracles the moral connexion between preaching the go&s;pel, and the mini&s;terial office, which is but little under|&s;tood in this place, where every one &s;eems to lay claim to it. It is the mandate of revelation, <HI>Go ye therefore and teach all nations, bapti&s;ing them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t; and lo I am with you always unto the end of the world.</HI> The very model and method of teaching is contained in
<PB N="17" REF="21">the &s;acred volumes; the be&s;t rules and exacte&s;t pattern is found there.</P>
<P>THOSE that would under&s;tand the parts and connexon of a &s;ermon, let them &s;tudy our Savi|our's &s;ermon upon the mount. It con&s;i&s;ts of the mo&s;t conci&s;e aphori&s;ms, &s;trong and clear argu|ments, and warm exhortations: Nothing but &s;o|lid and &s;ound argument run through the whole of that divine di&s;cour&s;e: No flaunty airs, or petulent expre&s;&s;ions, are to be found in this heavenly pattern of pulpit eloquence: Every point of truth natu|rally flow from one another: The &s;tile is &s;trong and manly, yet &s;imple and ea&s;y: The figures are homely, yet &s;ignificant and well adapted: This is the be&s;t &s;tandard for a method of preaching the go&s;pel; this is a pattern for every chri&s;tian author to imitate.</P>
<P>IN this divine &s;ermon evident and plain truths are laid down and &s;upported by the ju&s;te&s;t argu|ments, and the practice thereof recommended with all the energy of love and true zeal. The con|nexion between teaching and exhortation is one of the doctrines of divine revelation, and they are recommended to <HI>Timothy</HI> as two branches of the &s;ame office and method of teaching, 1 Tim. iv. 13. The &s;ame per&s;on that has a right publickly to exhort, has the &s;ame right to preach and teach publickly, if men keep by &s;cripture connexions. The evangeli&s;t <HI>Luke,</HI> chap. iii. 18. joins exhortation and preaching together; <HI>Many other things in his exhortation did he preach un|to the people.</HI> This rule of righteou&s;ne&s;s makes no difference between preaching the go&s;pel and exhor|tation. Some may be better qualified for di&s;char|ging one branch of his office than another part of it, but the true connected parts of it can never be
<PB N="18" REF="22">lawfully &s;eparated. Whoever is better fitted for one part of his office than another, will perhaps incline more after that which &s;uits be&s;t his capacity, but it never will be lawful to &s;eparate moral con|nexions. When the Apo&s;tle, Rom. xii. 6. &s;ays, <HI>Let him that teacheth wait on teaching, and he that exhorteth on exhortation,</HI> he is e&s;tabli&s;hing the di&s;|tinction between a doctor and a preacher, in that church which he had &s;ettled at <HI>Rome:</HI> He in&s;tructs the <HI>Romans</HI> that it was nece&s;&s;ary to have &s;eminaries of learning for teaching youth, as well as chri&s;tian a&s;&s;emblies for wor&s;hipping God. He therefore in&s;tructs them in this point, that when a man was found qualified for the &s;chools, it was nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ake of Chri&s;tianity, he &s;hould wait on that office; and though he was not dive&s;ted of his au|thority to preach the go&s;pel, yet teaching in the &s;chools was to be his peculiar care.</P>
<P>THE word of in&s;piration in the New Te&s;tament joins the&s;e two together, preaching of the go&s;pel and exhortation. The word which is u&s;ed to &s;ig|nify the one is often u&s;ed to &s;ignify the other, or both. That word is u&s;ed, 1 The&s;. ii. 3. for the go&s;pel it&s;elf, <HI>But our exhortation was not of de|ceit, nor uncleanne&s;s, nor of guile, but as we were al|$$$ed of God, to be put in tru&s;t with the go&s;pel, even &s;o we &s;peak,</HI> &amp;c. The&s;e divine oracles &s;hew us the connexion between all divine ordinances and offices: And here every thing nece&s;&s;ary for our faith and obedience is clearly opened up.</P>
<P><HI>Head</HI> 3d. To &s;hew that nothing can be added to the&s;e dictates of divine in&s;piration.</P>
<P N="1">1. THIS will appear from the perfection of the &s;criptures in all the preceding in&s;tances. It follows as a natural con&s;equence, that if all things nece&s;|&s;ary for faith and practice be contained in the &s;crip|tures,
<PB N="19" REF="23">nothing more can be nece&s;&s;ary to found a divine faith and regulate the chri&s;tian conduct. It is evident that the revealed will of God is de&s;igned to lead men to their &s;upreme happine&s;s: For every thing nece&s;&s;ary thereto is contained in the &s;acred pa|ges. To add thereto in any in&s;tance, is to dero|gate from that only perfection which is worthy the author of &s;uch a revelation. That God can give new di&s;coveries to his people, I make no que&s;tion; and that he may reveal to his church what was hid before from her, I make no doubt; but then all the&s;e di&s;coveries mu&s;t be judged by what is before revealed in the &s;criptures. Every pretended reve|lation or in&s;piration, if not agreeable to the word of God, is mere enthu&s;ia&s;m. If the &s;cripture be not the only &s;tandard of faith and practice, there can be no other: For every new in&s;piration is alto|gether uncertain, till it be tried by, and compared with, this former one in the holy &s;criptures. And if the former be compleat, and contain a perfect re|velation of the will of God to men for their eternal happine&s;s, no new in&s;piration can according to the nature of the thing be po&s;&s;ible; for perfection ex|cludes all addition.</P>
<P>No new revelation can be &s;upported wi$$ $$ffi|cient evidence, for it is contrary to the perfect. $word$ of the deity, to &s;upport with evidence what he has declared unnce&s;&s;ary by a compleat &s;y&s;tem of his will for all the ends and purpo&s;es of man's &s;al|vation. All preten&s;ions to in&s;piration, &s;ince the canon of the &s;cripture was fini&s;hed, is only a &s;ubtil invention of Satan to di&s;credit the &s;cripture. It would &s;eem, &s;ince Satan could not by deductions from the law of nature and rea&s;on overturn reve|lation, he has taken a more plau&s;ible &s;hift to under|mine it by new pretended in&s;pirations. The Al|mighty does nothing but for &s;ufficient rea&s;ons, and
<PB N="20" REF="24">all his ways are perfect and uniform like him&s;elf; and it could not agree with God's pure and perfect nature to give addition to perfection, or make op|po&s;ition to rectitude. <HI>The law of the Lord is per|fect,</HI> P&s;al. xix. 7. Upon &s;uppo&s;ition that the &s;crip|tures are a compleat draught of God's revealed will, in order to man's &s;alvation, can any new in&s;piration be admited without arguing imperfection in that revelation? There can no credit &s;afely be given to the Bible, nor is there any rea&s;on why men &s;hould depend upon what is contained in it for eternal happine&s;s, if we are &s;till to look for new in&s;pirati|ons: Nor can we believe God in any other new di&s;|covery, when he has declared the &s;cripture a com|pleat &s;y&s;tem, and yet is always making new addi|tions to it.</P>
<P>ALL new di&s;coveries of truth made to the church in after periods, was nothing more but the mean|ing of the word made more plain, or the &s;pirit's opening the great arcana gradually to believers: A bringing out of this trea&s;ure things old and new. The accompli&s;hment of prophecy that was in after|times better under&s;tood, was no new in&s;piration, but the &s;cripture unfolding it&s;elf in the proper time appointed. The various and many effects of the word of God, upon the &s;ouls of men &s;ince revelati|on was compleated, was nothing more but the word of the go&s;pel fulfilling its end in converting &s;ouls: This was revelation an&s;wering its own cha|racter, and accompli&s;hing that de&s;ign it was given for. The many conver&s;ions effected by the word were not new in&s;pirations, but the Holy Gho&s;t's working by his own in&s;trument, that was formed for that very purpo&s;e by a former in&s;piration. The renovation of the minds of true chri&s;tians, and their conver&s;ion to the faith of Je&s;us, was a work of the divine &s;pirit by the word of revelation, but was not
<PB N="21" REF="25">an in&s;piration of all the&s;e converts, upon whom the &s;pirit by the word wrought a change of nature and manner of life. Conver&s;ion is not therefore a di|vine in&s;piration, but an effect of it: A glorious work of the &s;pirit, wrought in the &s;oul by means of the word, that is the true gift of in&s;piration.</P>
<P>INSPIRATION in &s;cripture is never &s;o under&s;tood as to &s;ignify conver&s;ion, but is always u&s;ed to &s;ig|nify that impul&s;e of the Holy Spirit, whereby the&s;e extraordinary per&s;ons that wrote the &s;criptures were moved and directed. Conver&s;ion or regeneration is not &s;uch an impul&s;e, but a rational per&s;ua&s;ion of the mind to embrace the truth. It is a work that warms the &s;oul with tender feelings of divine love, pre&s;enting every truth to the mind in a rational manner. This is an abiding principle, and a rati|onal work of the divine &s;pirit, but no immediate impul&s;e or afflatus. The word in&s;piration is but twice u&s;ed in &s;cripture, and not in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e as to &s;ignify conver&s;ion or regeneration. It is u&s;ed Job xxxii. 8. to &s;ignify the rational &s;oul: <HI>Elihu</HI> is there &s;peaking of what is common to all men, namely rea&s;on, and urges that every one in their different &s;ituations &s;hould improve that rea&s;on God had given them, without re&s;pect to age or &s;eniority, when a vindication of truth required it. It is mentioned in our text, but &s;ignifies that impul&s;e wherewith the &s;acred amanuen&s;es were moved when they &s;pake and wrote by the immediate command of God. It is derogating from the only &s;ufficiency of the word of God, to e&s;tabli&s;h the need or po&s;&s;ibility of any new in&s;pirations: For all that is nece&s;&s;ary to conduct men to their &s;upreme happine&s;s and feli|city, is revealed in the &s;acred volumes. The &s;pirit now conducts men to happine&s;s, not by immediate in&s;piration, but by rational per&s;ua&s;ion in the u&s;e of means.</P>
<PB N="22" REF="26">
<P>THERE is this difference between conver&s;ion and in&s;piration; in the fir&s;t the Almighty without any addre&s;s unto men's rea&s;on and judgment, in&s;pired them to &s;peak and publi&s;h what &s;ometimes they did not under&s;tand, love, or chu&s;e, as in the ca&s;e of <HI>Balaam,</HI> and the High Prie&s;t before mentioned; but in conver&s;ion, he deals with men, by all the means of intelligence and motives of per&s;ua&s;ion.</P>
<P>HE propo&s;es nothing but what he makes them under&s;tand, and choo&s;e, as rea&s;onable and good. The one is effected by immediate impul&s;e, the o|ther by rational determination. Conver&s;ion is al|together con&s;i&s;tent with human freedom and liber|ty; and is a per&s;uading, not a forcing, men to &s;erve God: But in&s;piration has no regard to the will and choice of men; for when the in&s;pired per&s;ons were under the influence of in&s;piration, they could not go beyond the commandment of the Lord: In|&s;piration obliged them whether it was their choice or not, to &s;peak and act according to their impul&s;e.</P>
<P>IN this ca&s;e they were only vehicles, by which the mind of God was revealed to others; in the other ca&s;e men are the &s;ubjects in which the &s;pirit ope|rates by means of that revelation. They are nei|ther forced nor compelled to embrace any truth again&s;t their will.</P>
<P N="2">2. IT would de&s;troy the &s;upremacy of the &s;crip|tures as the only &s;tandard of faith and obedience, if any addition could be made to the oracles of God than their &s;tanding orthodoxy, as a perfect rule would cea&s;e, and of con&s;equence we could have no well grounded confidence in God. If God, as an arbitrary being, could give new revelations contrary to tho&s;e already given in the &s;criptures concerning man's &s;alvation, it would not be worthy of credit nor confidence; nay men would be in a wor&s;e &s;itu|ation than if there had never been any revelation at
<PB N="23" REF="27">all: For all the evidence that proved the fir&s;t to be &s;ufficient, by the &s;econd is made of no effect; and all former believers mu&s;t be looked upon as tan|talized by a mock &s;alvation, contained in an im|perfect or fal&s;e revelation.</P>
<P>SINCE the Almighty hath already given us a compleat di&s;covery of all things nece&s;&s;ary to be known for our &s;alvation, and hath &s;ealed this &s;y&s;tem in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, with the mo&s;t awful cer|tifications, is it conceivable that he &s;hould give new additions, after &s;uch a &s;olemn ratification of this perfect rule? All evidence given to any future re|velation would be unworthy of any regard: The mo&s;t &s;triking miracles could not give any weight to any man's mi&s;&s;ion to publi&s;h new revelations, nor add authority to his doctrines, unle&s;s we could conceive the God of heaven to bear fal&s;e witne&s;s a|gain&s;t him&s;elf, and make the nature of moral truth directly fal&s;e. God may add new lu&s;tre to his word, and make it appear with more evidence to his church, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his &s;pirit; but this is no new revelation, but expounding more fully what was before revealed. This is only an improvement of the &s;criptures to their greater end and de&s;ign. Any new pretended di&s;coveries in matters of religi|on, however &s;triking they may &s;eem to be, if they do not exactly agree with the written word of God, they cannot be admitted into our holy religion. There is not now the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity for in&s;piration that was in the days of the prophets and apo&s;tles. It was nece&s;&s;ary at fir&s;t to make God's mind known to the world, and afterwards in the New Te&s;tament times it was nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e it was promi&s;ed to be continued. The prophets foretold that new di&s;coveries would be made to the church in the New Te&s;tament days, Joel ii. 28. In&s;piration under the New Te&s;tament was nece&s;&s;ary for two rea&s;ons,
<PB N="24" REF="28">till the canon was &s;ealed; fir&s;t, to fulfil the pro|phecies, and &s;econdly, to compleat the canon. Our Saviour promi&s;ed the &s;pirit for this purpo&s;e, <HI>If I go away I &s;hall &s;end the Comforter, and he &s;hall teach you all things, and bring all things to your re|membrance.</HI> But when God had done all that he had &s;aid he would do in this particular, there was no more need for in&s;piration. The Old Te&s;tament told the church what <HI>Je&s;us</HI> &s;hould be, and do; and the New Te&s;tament informs us of the fulfillment of all this$$. There remains now nothing needful either for life or godline&s;s to be revealed, for the two Te&s;taments contain all. The rea&s;ons for in|&s;piration being now over, it is &s;elf &s;uperceded. When an infinitely perfect being has given a perfect reve|lation of his mind and will to his church, and &s;ealed this; and declared it to be the &s;tandard of faith and obedience; could he in a con&s;i&s;tency with his holy character give any new in&s;piration, when he hath &s;aid, <HI>It is fini&s;hed, the judge of all the earth mu&s;t do right.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. THIS is evident from the threatnings denoun|ced again&s;t &s;uch as add to, or dimini&s;h from, the holy oracles. Either the &s;criptures mu&s;t be true or fal&s;e: If true, &s;o mu&s;t their threatnings be, and it mu&s;t be pre&s;umption to add to the&s;e divine dictates. If they are fal&s;e it &s;hould be made appear, by proving their evidence in&s;ufficient; the latter has always been attempted without &s;ucce&s;s, and &s;o the former mu&s;t be the truth. Therefore nothing can be ad|ded to the &s;cripture without danger of eternal ruin. Any addition &s;uppo&s;es imperfection or in&s;ufficiency in that which it is added unto, at lea&s;t &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary relation of the one to the other, or then the additi|on is improper, and the union of the parts added unju&s;t. If there be a nece&s;&s;ity of additional revelati|ons or in&s;pirations, the fir&s;t revelation mu&s;t, no
<PB N="25" REF="29">doubt, labour under &s;ome defect; and how unju&s;t mu&s;t it be in the deity to challenge men into &s;in, and threaten them with puni&s;hment if they look for any addition, or make any, to this imperfect re|velation? Upon this &s;uppo&s;ition who can vindicate the moral character of God? Mu&s;t not every ra|tional being conclude him to be unju&s;t, and unrea|&s;onable, to give them an in&s;ufficient revelation of his will, and yet threaten them with the cruele&s;t pu|ni&s;hment for looking for, and &s;eeking after ano|ther? From all which it is evident, that nothing can be added warrantably to the &s;criptures.</P>
<P><HI>Head</HI> 4th. To &s;hew that all future di&s;coveries in matters of religion, and chri&s;tian experience, are to be judged by the &s;tandard of the word of God.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t, THIS will appear from the exten&s;ive morality of the &s;criptures, in an&s;wering all the ends and pur|po&s;es of true felicity. There is no po&s;&s;ible condi|tion of life, either pro&s;perous or adver&s;e, but either the rules or comforts of the &s;criptures may be ap|plied unto: Neither is there any &s;tate of &s;oul that a chri&s;tian can be in, but &s;omething u&s;eful to correct or &s;trengthen him therein, may be found in the &s;criptures. With relation to what we are to believe concerning God in every relation he &s;tands in to us, we are &s;ufficiently informed by the word of God: And nothing is revealed as matter of our faith, but what is perfectly agreeable to the nature of the deity. There is no other certain infallible &s;y&s;tem our faith can re&s;t &s;ure upon, Should we be left to gather&punc; what we are to believe concerning God, from his works and operations, our faith would de|pend upon the uncertain bottom of human infe|rence: For though the premi&s;es are ju&s;t, we might err in drawing the conclu&s;ion. But when our faith
<PB N="26" REF="30">is limited by the divine will, to certain infallible points, it mu&s;t be founded upon a &s;ure ground and foundation. The only moral ground of a chri&s;tian faith, is the warrant to believe in the divine com|mandment; and no more can be accounted faith, morally con&s;idered, but what is binding upon us by the will of God in divine revelation.</P>
<P>IT follows, as a native con&s;equence from this, that all future di&s;coveries in matters of faith and experience, mu&s;t be judged by the &s;criptures; be|cau&s;e they are the mind and will of God, that ex|tends to all matters po&s;&s;ibly belonging to a divine faith. Neither are their any duties binding upon a rea&s;onable creature, but what may be found in this revelation: What we are to God, our neigh|bour, and our&s;elves, is there de&s;cribed and laid out to our view in the cleare&s;t manner: Every bene|volent principle, and that tender regard due to all the human &s;pecies, are there warmly recommended.</P>
<P>SINCE in the &s;criptures we have all that is ne|ne&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute men good and happy, as it were &s;ummed up, which no where el&s;e can be found in &s;o clear and full a light; they mu&s;t rationally be the judge of all future di&s;coveries in matters of faith and religious experience.</P>
<P N="2">2. THIS may be gathered from the oppo&s;ition of the depraved nature of man to the divine oracles. There is nothing &s;o oppo&s;ite to men's irregular pa&s;&s;ions and appetites, as perfect and exact rules: What therefore is the butt of their oppo&s;ition, mu&s;t be &s;omething perfect and regular. There are few per&s;ons that love to live loo&s;ely, but in &s;ome degree find fault with the &s;criptures. Laws and govern|ment, have in all ages been the eye-&s;ore of the vi|cious; and that the &s;criptures are &s;o much de&s;pi&s;ed is an evidence of their &s;tanding orthodoxy. Did not the &s;acred oracles e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;tandard of faith
<PB N="27" REF="31">and obedience, for what rea&s;on could the unbe|liever, libertine, and vicious find fault with them? Were they imperfect or defective they would be &s;o much the more like them&s;elves, and &s;imilarly would beget e&s;teem: But as they are a &s;tanding rule of con|formity to the divine nature, they are &s;o much the more de&s;pi&s;ed by men; who love to live too freely: If not, e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;criptures as the only rule and &s;tandard of faith and practice. Many will admit them as collateral helps along with, either their in|ward feelings, or darling prejudices; but if you once make them the only rule and &s;tandard of our tru&s;t, and conduct, they pre&s;ently are found faulty. Though perhaps a &s;eemingly pious enthu&s;ia&s;t will not &s;peak openly again&s;t the divine oracles, (which would be too public an evidence of infidelity) yet when he holds in principle and practice, what is directly contrary unto them, it is a proof that he does not admit them as the only &s;ufficient &s;tandard of faith and obdience. When there are &s;undry ex|pre&s;s evidences from &s;cripture again&s;t his received faith and feeling, if he believe the word of God, he will prefer revelation to imagination and human conceit.</P>
<P>THE fault found with revelation, is not &s;o much that it is deficient, as that it admits of no human inventions contrary to its pure morality; and that it is the only judge of future di&s;coveries in religion, is plain from that fear &s;inners, and enthu&s;ia&s;ts of all &s;orts, have to undergo a trial by its pure and per|fect rules and doctrines.</P>
<P N="3">3. THIS is evident from expre&s;s te&s;timony from God him&s;elf, I&s;ai. viii. 20. There were at that time many that &s;ought after new revelations and vi&s;ions, that were diabolical; they went to wiz|zards and familiar &s;pirits, where they got pretend|ed revelations. The Lord in&s;tructs his people what reply to make to &s;uch as wanted to &s;educe them
<PB N="28" REF="32">from the pure ways of truth, into the&s;e fal&s;e and diabolical delu&s;ions; to tell them they were to &s;eek unto God: And in order to find out their deceit, to try them by the rule of the word, as in ver&s;e 20; <HI>To the law and to the te&s;timony: If they &s;peak not ac|cording to this word, it is becau&s;e there is no light in them.</HI> The law and the te&s;timony was the only judge of faith and experience from its very fir&s;t pro|mulgation; and it mu&s;t certainly continue, unle&s;s it can be proved that the nature of it is changed. Let men pretend to what in&s;piration they will, if they cannot &s;hew their agreement with the law and the te&s;timony, the written word of God, they de|&s;erve no more regard than magical incantations. It is not pretended piety and good meaning, that will authenticate or authorize any new di&s;coveries in religion, otherwi&s;e all the heathen oracles might be brought in as coequal with chri&s;tian in&s;titutions: For they were as pious in their &s;uper&s;titions, and more &s;o, than many chri&s;tians in their wor&s;hipping and &s;erving the true God<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At pius Aeneas arces, quibus altus Apollo
<L>Prae&s;idet, horrendaeque procul &s;ecreta Sibyllae,</L>

<L>Delius in&s;pirat vates, aperitque-futura.</L>
<BIBL><HI>VIRG. l. 6. v. 9.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. But no chri&s;tian will certainly believe, that &s;incere &s;uper&s;tition and en|thu&s;ia&s;m is according to the law and the te&s;timony: If compared with this rule it will be found want|ing. It is plain that the &s;criptures are an univer&s;al &s;tandard of all doctrines, faith and experience, as they belong to the chri&s;tian religion. Since the holy oracles comprehend all that's nece&s;&s;ary to be believed concerning God, every thing that's u&s;eful for a religious life, and needful to con&s;ummate men's moral character and true felicity, and render them well plea&s;ing in the &s;ight of God, no new &s;y&s;tem can be received that is not agreeable to this revela|tion:
<PB N="29" REF="33">By this we ought to try our faith and expe|rience, by the &s;ame we are to examine our practice and manner of life. It follows, that men &s;hould be well acquainted with the &s;criptures; read and fre|quently meditate upon them; pray for the divine ble&s;&s;ing upon every application unto them: That by the word of God they may become &s;trong in faith and religious experience, be helpful unto one another, till at la&s;t, like the man of God, by the word they be made perfect.</P>
<P>HAVING thus viewed the &s;criptures as the only rule to direct us how we may glorify God and en|joy him; as a &s;tandard of faith and the only rule of practice: It may be nece&s;&s;ary now to &s;hew what improvement we ought to make of this &s;ubject.</P>
<P N="1">1. To correct our mi&s;takes, either in matters of belief or conduct. Such as have embraced o|pinions repugnant to this holy &s;y&s;tem of religious principles, ought to correct their faith, and lay a|&s;ide that belief that is not founded upon this divine te&s;timony. To believe more in matters of religion than God hath revealed, is equally dangerous with infidelity; for it is &s;o far a di&s;crediting the revealed mind of God in his word, and reflects the charge of in&s;ufficiency upon his perfect law.</P>
<P>To found our tru&s;t in God upon any concepti|ons that are not contained in his revealed will, is to build our hou&s;e upon the &s;and, and to lay ano|ther foundation than Je&s;us hath laid. The &s;crip|tures point out the con&s;i&s;tency of all the divine at|tributes in the &s;alvation of &s;inners; and to found our tru&s;t upon any of the&s;e attributes, to the di&s;|honour of the other branches of his character, is to found our confidence upon what revealed religion hath never pointed out as a true foundation. To found our faith upon the divine goodne&s;s, and not take in the idea of ju&s;tice, truth and holine&s;s, is to have an unworthy notion of God's moral character.
<PB N="30" REF="34">Nothing can be truly good that is not ju&s;t and e|quitable, pure and &s;potle&s;s. If goodne&s;s be con&s;i|dered as a mere propen&s;ity to our happine&s;s, without any re&s;pect to the con&s;i&s;tency of the divine admini|&s;tration, it is what God cannot be&s;tow and men need never expect: For he will by no means clear the guilty. Goodne&s;s as it re&s;pects men's de&s;ire of happi|ne&s;s, may be far from being agreeable to God's mo|ral di&s;pen&s;ations; and if our faith be founded upon &s;uch a notion of goodne&s;s, it very much needs cor|rection. Nothing is truly good that is not con&s;i&s;|tant with God's moral character revealed in the &s;crip|ture; and if we tru&s;t in God as good, in order to &s;al|vation, it mu&s;t be in &s;uch a way as takes in all the branches of his moral character revealed in the holy oracles. A true notion of the divine goodne&s;s, is that which makes him truly good of him&s;elf. To view his goodne&s;s as it is a forgiving of our offences, with|out con&s;idering how he can do this con&s;i&s;tently with the honour of his character, betrays both want of under&s;tanding, and true tru&s;t in the Almighty. The apo&s;tle tells us that God is ju&s;t when he ju&s;tifies the ungodly, &s;o that this goodne&s;s they receive from God, comes in the very channel of rectitude and ju&s;tice. Whoever forms a notion of goodne&s;s di&s;|tant from truth and ju&s;tice, and founds their confi|dence upon it, will meet with a mi&s;erable di&s;ap|pointment. Nay, this could not in its own nature be good: For all conceptions of the divine cha|racter, that afford any ground for our faith and confidence, mu&s;t be &s;uch as make it con&s;i&s;tent, otherwi&s;e our faith is delu&s;ion, and our hope pre|&s;umption. Our faith mu&s;t be &s;uch as has a war|rant in divine revelation, a confidence in a recon|ciled God, through his &s;on Je&s;us, in whom mercy and truth meet together, righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace ki&s;s one another. True faith is founded upon God's new covenant relations, and our tru&s;t in him
<PB N="31" REF="35">is fixt upon that mercy our Mediator hath pur|cha&s;ed as the head of the new covenant; otherwi&s;e our tru&s;t is mere deceit, and our faith a fancy.</P>
<P>IT is the Almighty's own de&s;cription of him&s;elf in his word, and not every vain conceit we may have of him, that is the warrant of our belief, and the foundation of our tru&s;t. A faith founded upon &s;uch an unworthy view of the divine being, as to conceive him only good as he is inclined towards our happine&s;s, will never influence men to an uni|ver&s;al obedience of his law. Con&s;idering our pre|&s;ent imperfect &s;tate and &s;ituation through &s;in and corruption, there is need, in order to excite us to a true and univer&s;al obedience, to have before our eyes all the&s;e means and motives, &s;uitable to awaken our &s;ouls from their dead and indifferent condition.</P>
<P>TO view the Almighty as pure, ju&s;t and holy, as well as good and ready to forgive, will excite the mind to imitate him in the&s;e branches of his character; as there can be no communion with him without being like him. The obedience of every chri&s;tian, will be in proportion to their faith in the Almighty; and their imitation of the attributes of his nature, will only extend as far as they under|&s;tand and believe them. It would de&s;troy the no|tion of true goodne&s;s, to conceive of a happine&s;s that did not comprehend a conformity to God in all his revealed moral chracter. To imagine that the Deity is &s;uch a good-natured being, as to give up truth and equity for the &s;ake of our happine&s;s, and &s;o forgive &s;in without reparation to his ju&s;tice, and honour to his law, &s;uitable for the offence given, and repentance on the &s;inner's part, is to tru&s;t him for what is contrary to his nature to be|&s;tow.</P>
<P>IT is true indeed, the method and means of &s;al|vation are of his own contriving, and freely revealed to, and be&s;towed upon his people; but both the plan
<PB N="32" REF="36">and the pro&s;ecution thereof are con&s;i&s;tent with his revealed character. Our faith in Je&s;us mu&s;t be according to that method he hath given to us in his word; where every attribute of the divine na|ture is di&s;played to the highe&s;t degree and advan|tage: We mu&s;t rule our notions of the divine Be|ing, according to the&s;e mo&s;t plain de&s;criptions he hath given of him&s;elf in revelation; and not bring the&s;e de&s;criptions down to the &s;tandard of our im|perfect capacities. To conclude that the Almighty would have a fairer character if adorned with other attributes, or if he exerci&s;ed his perfections in ano|ther manner, when we can already ea&s;ily &s;ee the meaning of his own de&s;cription in the &s;acred oracles, is to form a deity to our&s;elves, that revelation is ignorant of, and to &s;eek another God than the only true God. Men ought to correct their petulent fancies, and their enterprizing imaginations, by this rule, of which it is &s;aid that it is perfect: <HI>The law of the Lord is perfect,</HI> P&s;al. xix. 7. That faith fiction, that tru&s;ts a God for is no more than &s;alvation, that is a creature of fancy, and does not credit the true God upon his own te&s;timony.</P>
<P>ALL preten&s;ions to a&s;&s;urance, and hope of hea|ven, that is not &s;pecially founded upon &s;cripture re|cord, is a fal&s;e confidence, and will end in bitter|ne&s;s and &s;orrow. The &s;criptures are profitable for our correction in this point; let us then place no tru&s;t and confidence in the almighty that his own word does not warrant and authorize, otherwi&s;e our confidence will for&s;ake us when we need it mo&s;t, and our hope peri&s;h with that of the hypocrite. The &s;criptures are al&s;o profitable to correct the er|rors of our conduct, and manner of life. When men fall into immoralities, which are both offen|&s;ive to God, and oppo&s;ite to our true intere&s;t, they are not left to &s;earch out their errors by the means of human prudence, or to reform according to the
<PB N="33" REF="37">dictates of fancy and conceit; but the word of God is the light by which they are to &s;earch them, and the rule by which they are to correct them. It was by the written law that good king <HI>Jo&s;iah</HI> found out the fins and immoralities of <HI>Judah;</HI> and by the &s;ame he conducted the whole of that reformation he &s;o happily brought about. By this the apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> came to know &s;in, and learn righteou&s;ne&s;s, to cor|rect his judgment and amend his life: By the law of God his inward &s;entiments and public profe&s;&s;ion were corrected. And all men that would rightly amend their abu&s;es, either in matters of faith or praictce, mu&s;t improve the divine oracles as the rule of their correction.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE &s;cripture is of u&s;e to correct our hopes and expectations. Men are ready to extend their hopes beyond their ju&s;t bounds, and to hope farther than the Almighty gives any ground; expect things that are incon&s;i&s;tent with the divine nature to be&s;tow. When a luxuriant imagination found the expectation of happine&s;s upon a confu&s;ed no|tion of inconnected objects, joining in the notion of felicity things that never were nor can be uni|ted, under a &s;hew of hope they &s;upport them&s;elves by arrogant pre&s;umption. To hope for forgive|ne&s;s becau&s;e God is merciful, when repentance is not taken into the idea and notion of hope, or to expect that God will pardon men's &s;ins when they live in the practice of them, is to make a fal&s;e connexion of ideas, and con&s;equently a fal&s;e and counterfeit hope. The &s;cripture account of the chri&s;tian hope, is far different from &s;uch a ground|le&s;s expectation; he that hath this hope in him, purifieth him&s;elf, even as he is pure. Purity and &s;olid hope are in&s;eparably joined together in &s;crip|ture, and the believer's hope will be more or le&s;s &s;trong, as he advances in purity, or is defiled with &s;in. There is no connexion between divine mercy
<PB N="34" REF="38">and &s;in to make a &s;inner hope for happine&s;s, when he daily abu&s;es the goodne&s;s of the Almighty.</P>
<P>THE &s;inner that hopes in the mercy of God, and lives in the love and practice of &s;in, nece&s;&s;arily con|nects in his hope pure and holy mercy with &s;in, the enemy of the divine nature; and therefore his hope can never be &s;olid, however plea&s;ing in the mean time: For the &s;cripture de&s;cription of hope is that it is pure: He that hath it, purifieth him&s;elf. True hope is founded upon truth; upon the holy oracles of God, Heb. vi. 18. whereby it is impo&s;&s;i|ble for him to lie; and no expectation that is not founded in truth will ever be fulfilled, but meet with di&s;appointment. The God of truth hath a&s;|&s;ured us, that &s;uch only &s;hall find mercy as for&s;ake &s;in: To hope for mercy any other way is not ac|cording to God's revealed will, but is a pre&s;uming upon his goodne&s;s without the lea&s;t foundation. The law and te&s;timony is the rule for correcting &s;uch mi&s;takes, in the matter of our future expecta|tions of happine&s;s; and &s;uch as build their hopes upon any other foundation but upon the written word of God, will find it the hope of the hypocrite that will peri&s;h.</P>
<P N="3">3. WE &s;hould improve the &s;criptures, to en|crea&s;e our love to God and all men. The go&s;pel recomends love as the mo&s;t &s;hining branch of the chri&s;tian character: It is even the very &s;um of mo|ral perfection: The highe&s;t perfection our nature is capable of, either in this life or that which is to come. This duty is the univer&s;al breath of divine revelation. The mutual love between <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and believers, is beautifully de&s;cribed in many pa&s;&s;ages of &s;acred writ: Particularly in the <HI>Song of Solomon,</HI> and the 45 <HI>P&s;alm,</HI> and &s;et down for our imitation. When we read of the &s;aints love to God, and their communion with him, let us improve this to in|crea&s;e our love and regard to the Almighty, and
<PB N="35" REF="39">to that Saviour that loved us and gave him&s;elf for us. When we collate the mutual love of the &s;aints among them&s;elves, let us improve this as a mean to rai&s;e our love and e&s;teem of all good men. The love of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> to his friends and enemies, is lively de&s;cribed through the whole hi&s;tory of his life in the Evangeli&s;ts: Let us then imitate this ble&s;&s;ed example, and follow <HI>Je&s;us</HI> in doing good to all. The &s;criptures teach us impartiality in our love to our fellow-chri&s;tians, and inforce univer&s;al bene|volence to all that bear the &s;ame image.</P>
<P>WHATEVER different per&s;ua&s;ions men may have, ari&s;ing from the different views they have of truth, yet this is no rea&s;on why we &s;hould remove our affections from them, or deprive them of our love: The word of God authorizes no &s;uch practice, but obliges us to love all men, e&s;pecially all the hou&s;|hold of faith. Our love and e&s;teem of others is not to be founded upon their &s;imilitude to us in their per&s;ua&s;ion and experience, but upon what is their ju&s;t merit in them&s;elves, as lovers of God and truth, as they are able to under&s;tand them. Men that only love their fellow-chri&s;tians as they can read their own principles and experience in them, do not e&s;teem them for their merit, but for what of them&s;elves they &s;ee in them: Hereby they make their own experience the rule of their e&s;teem, and not the command of their Lord and ma&s;ter, who &s;ays, <HI>By this &s;hall all men know that ye are my di&s;ciples, if ye love one another.</HI> It is indeed the me|lancholy evil of our times, that the word of God is not &s;o much improved, to find out what is vir|tuous, amiable and lovely in our fellow-chri&s;tians, as to &s;earch out their faults and &s;queeze their reputa|tions, as if none were to be loved but &s;uch as are perfect. The mo&s;t part where they &s;py one fault, they can be&s;tow no love. Moral precepts that e&s;pecially bind us to love one another, are &s;infully applied to all our neighbours faults we can di&s;cern,
<PB N="36" REF="40">exclu&s;ive of all their virtues. How unrea&s;onable is it to think that all men &s;hould &s;ee alike, in mat|ters of religion, when neither their tempers, edu|cation, nor advantages are the &s;ame. To have a bad opinion of all who differ from us, and re&s;train our love and affections from them, becau&s;e they believe more or le&s;s than we do, is ju&s;t as rea|&s;onable as to hate our brother becau&s;e he could not eat the &s;ame food, becau&s;e his &s;tomach could not dige&s;t it. The many unlawful di&s;tinctions that are kept up among the ordinary profe&s;&s;ors of religion, ari&s;e from their not improving the benevolent prin|ciples that are &s;o much inculcated in divine revela|tion. From the &s;ame &s;ource proceed the&s;e un|charitable &s;entiments, that the different parties have of one another. Though perhaps we cannot agree with others in their &s;entiments, of certain points and principles, more than we could dige&s;t food they could live upon; yet no man ought to deprive his brother of that love due to him, nor hate him for his way of thinking: He de&s;erves love and e&s;teem, though he may be weaker or &s;tronger than the re&s;t of his brethren. It is incon&s;i&s;tent with that love and genero&s;ity the &s;cripture records, to think evil of our brethren becau&s;e they cannot go all the lengths that we our&s;elves can go. It may as well be &s;up|po&s;ed that men &s;hall be of one &s;ize, as that they &s;hall agree in every article of religion: And if we cannot love or do good to any but &s;uch as an&s;wer our mea&s;ure, our regard is not &s;o exten&s;ive as the word of God requires it to be; for it commands us even to love our enemies. To improve the &s;criptures right, for the end of encrea&s;ing our love to God and men, let us view every thing that is amiable in the divine nature, as therein de&s;cribed, and every thing in men that bears a re&s;emblance to this: Not to overlook the virtues of our fellow-chri&s;tians, becau&s;e they are not &s;o perfect as we
<PB N="37" REF="41">might expect, but love in them what&s;oever is like the Author of perfection. And as the &s;criptures urge the practice of acts of kindne&s;s, the true fruits of love and regard, let us not withhold the&s;e when it is in our power to perform them, from a &s;pirit of partiality to party and &s;ect. It is not a well di|rected love that operates the way of partiality. A worthy object is not le&s;s amiable, becau&s;e it may be oppo&s;ite to &s;omething we e&s;teem; yea though our intere&s;t in &s;ome ca&s;es may &s;tand in the way of our beneficence, we mu&s;t go over it to expre&s;s our love to a worthy object. Though a per&s;on, for &s;ome rea&s;ons we know not, may be our enemy, (if in other re&s;pects he is valuable) we are to love him and &s;erve his intere&s;t. It is the command of the great Lawgiver, <HI>If thine enemy be hungry, give him meat; if he is thir&s;ty, give him drink.</HI> It is an evidence the &s;criptures are neither rightly under&s;tood nor improved by &s;uch, who in&s;tead of love and bene|volence, con&s;tantly practi&s;e hatred, malice and en|vy: In&s;tead of wi&s;hing well to all men or any man, they belch out &s;candal and reproach again&s;t every one, and would e&s;tabli&s;h their own intere&s;t upon the ruin of every character: Let &s;uch remember, they act contrary to the holy oracles of God, and the whole amiable draughts of the divine nature that are drawn there, and in&s;tead of imitating God, imi|tate him, of whom it is ju&s;tly &s;aid, <HI>He is a liar, and the father of it.</HI> Let them cultivate a better ac|quaintance with the &s;criptures, correct their errors thereby, and encrea&s;e their love therewith: For, <HI>All &s;cripture is given by in&s;piration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, and for in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>I SHALL now conclude this &s;ubject with laying down a few rules, for u&s;ing and improving the &s;criptures, for all the afore&s;aid purpo&s;es.</P>
<P><HI>Rule</HI> 1. READ the &s;criptures without prejudice
<PB N="38" REF="42">in favour of any received opinion. It is the truth of the &s;acred oracles them&s;elves, that ought to re|commend them to our e&s;teem, and not their &s;uitable|ne&s;s to &s;ome points we may unju&s;tly &s;et a value upon. Our enquiry into the holy oracles mu&s;t be free, if it be right, and not fettered with prejudices that will darken the evidence of &s;cripture witne&s;s. It is inju&s;tice done divine revelation, only willingly to admit its evidence when it is mo&s;t favourable to our &s;entiments: This is to make our own opinion a &s;tandard for revelation, and not the &s;cripture the rule of our opinion. Hereby men lo&s;e the advan|tage of divine in&s;truction, and remain wilfully ig|norant, by being determined beforehand what evi|dence they will admit. Whatever reverence men may pay to churches, or fathers, or traditions re|ceived from them, a greater re&s;pect is due to the Father of &s;pirits, and the King of the catholic church: Our fir&s;t received opinions are very ready to need correction, if not a total abolition; and perfecte&s;t views of truth we can have in this life, will need a&s;&s;i&s;tance from revelation: We &s;hould therefore leave our eyes open to the light of divine revelation, and willingly admit &s;cripture evidence, and not &s;hut them again&s;t the light, by imagining we are perfect. It is either pride or &s;hame, or both, that hinders men from parting with received notions when they &s;ee the &s;cripture again&s;t them. Men are &s;o ready to value their former pains and labour that they have been at in attaining to their fir&s;t opinions, that it is a great mortification to them to be obliged to confe&s;s they have err'd. Pride and a fooli&s;h ba&s;hfulne&s;s ari&s;ing therefrom, hinder many from acknowledging what &s;cripture and con&s;cience informs them is true. If we would receive true benefit from the word of God, we mu&s;t read it with an open heart, and lay a&s;ide our pre|judices in favour of any thing el&s;e that may dar|ken
<PB N="39" REF="43">its evidence or hinder its reception into our hearts.</P>
<P><HI>Rule</HI> 2. SEEK for the meaning of what &s;eems more ob&s;cure, by comparing it with what is more &s;imple and plain. When any truth is conveyed in a figure that is not evident at fir&s;t view, the mean|ing that makes the &s;cope con&s;i&s;tent, and conveys the cleare&s;t views of the divine character, and the &s;im|ple&s;t notions of religion, is likelie&s;t to be the mind of the &s;pirit of God. For example, when <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;ays, <HI>I am the bread of life, and he that eateth my fle&s;h and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me and I in him;</HI> he teaches his di&s;ciples in a figure, that he was the &s;ub&s;tance pointed out by the manna of old, and that tho&s;e that believed in him &s;hould enjoy &s;piritual and eternal life: By the figure of eating his fle&s;h and drinking his blood, he points out the communion that believers have with him by faith: That tho&s;e who believed his death and re&s;urrection &s;hould enjoy communion with him: That he would love them and they him, which he calls a|biding in them, and they in him. He would abide in them by grace, and they &s;hould abide in his &s;ervice and the profe&s;&s;ion of his faith. This is a|greeable with the &s;cope of the place and many other plain &s;imple texts of &s;cripture; &s;uch as <HI>He that be|lieveth &s;hall be &s;aved; I will put my &s;pirit within you, and cau&s;e you to walk in my &s;tatutes.</HI> Moreover in comparing of idioms we are to be careful not to receive more into our pre&s;ent meaning, than the author of &s;cripture de&s;igned to convey. When we find the idiom of &s;cripture different from what is of u&s;e among us, we mu&s;t &s;earch diligently for plain and &s;imple pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, which tend to ex|plain the meaning and clear the idiom; and when we find what truth the idiom conveys in our lan|guage, and according to our cu&s;toms, we are to re&s;t there till better informed. When by compari|&s;on
<PB N="40" REF="44">we have found what &s;uch idioms taught, in the language of &s;cripture in the&s;e times, we will more ea&s;ily under&s;tand how to apply them to our own cir|cum&s;tances and times. For example, when it is &s;aid <HI>Chri&s;t was made &s;in for us;</HI> this idiom repre&s;ents <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in not a very favourable point of view, and like|wi&s;e i&s;&s;ues in a contradiction, <HI>Who knew no &s;in.</HI> But if we con&s;ider the difference of idiom, we will find that he was made a &s;in-offering for us, or as the apo&s;tle to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>He offered him|&s;elf once for our &s;ins.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rule</HI> 3. READ the &s;criptures, and improve them with fervent prayer and devotion. Let your minds be filled with holy reverence of God, as the author of &s;cripture, and beg his a&s;&s;i&s;tance to make you un|der&s;tand them. Say with <HI>David,</HI> P&s;al. cix. 18. <HI>Open thou mine eyes, that I may &s;ee the wonders of thy law.</HI> It is not &s;ufficient to read the word of God with judgment and care, but we &s;hould al&s;o read it with reverence and godly fear. Endeavour to have our hearts quickened and our affections enlivened there|by, that we may not only become wi&s;er by under|&s;tanding its truths, but better by making a &s;uitable improvement of them. To be accurate in &s;earch|ing for the meaning of the word of God, and not earne&s;t and de&s;irous to do the duties therein con|tained, may exalt men's pride, but will never bet|ter their morals, nor reform their hearts. Tho&s;e that would reap advantage by the &s;criptures mu&s;t, with all humility and godly fear, beg the divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance to enable them to come to the knowlege of the truth, and make them live according to that knowlege: otherwi&s;e they may read the book of God all their lifetime, and have a transforming view of its author, nor ta&s;te of its &s;weets and comforts. <HI>Jeremiah</HI> could &s;ay, <HI>Thy word was found of me, and I did eat it; it was to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart.</HI> The peru&s;ing the &s;acred records, &s;piritual
<PB N="41" REF="45">concern and devotion, is only paying them the compliment of romance or hi&s;tory, making them rather an amu&s;ement than a divine entertainment to the &s;oul: It is but the practice of too many, that are no novices in literal knowledge of the &s;crip|tures, to neglect to improve them for warming of their hearts. Though they contain glad tidings of great joy to all people, there are but few that im|prove them to rai&s;e their e&s;teem of the Almighty, and to &s;et their affections upon things above.</P>
<P><HI>Rule</HI> 4. Meditate upon the &s;criptures; con&s;ider their nature, end, and properties. Like the godly man the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> &s;peaks of, <HI>Meditate upon the law of the Lord day and night.</HI> By con&s;idering the na|ture of the word we will &s;ee the beautiful draughts of the divine character therein di&s;played; by medi|tating upon its end and de&s;ign, we will learn the wi&s;dom of its author, in the various fulfillment of his de&s;igns and purpo&s;es: By &s;eriou&s;ly attending to its various properties, we will &s;ee a beautiful vari|ety, all centering in a pure and univer&s;al whole: By meditation and due con&s;ideration of the &s;crip|tures, we may from known truths come to &s;ee more of their beauty and excellency; and from the knowledge of one truth, come by degrees to the under&s;tanding of more. Meditation enlarges the mind for the reception of truth, and al&s;o encrea&s;es the de&s;ire for new inve&s;tigations. It will rai&s;e our e&s;teem of the &s;criptures and their author, to medi|tate frequently upon them; and by viewing the glories thereof, we will be ready to be charmed with their excellency. Meditation upon the oracles of God, will make it habitual to our &s;ouls to keep up communion with God thereby: In this exer|ci&s;e the &s;erious &s;oul will find joy, and be made to &s;ay with the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t, I rejoice at thy word as one who hath found great &s;poil.</HI> The holy rules therein contained, will be a joyful path of righteou&s;ne&s;s, in
<PB N="42" REF="46">which the &s;oul will love to walk: The gracious promi&s;es therein exhibited, will be &s;prings of com|fort to the mind in all difficulties. Meditation will place all the&s;e in their due order, and regularly u&s;e them for their various ends of improvement.</P>
<P><HI>Rule</HI> 5. BEWARE of turning &s;cripture into en|thu&s;ia&s;m. True devotion fills the mind with rati|onal delight in the word of God, and creates a joy that is la&s;ting and permanent. This is oppo&s;ed un|to the joy of the hypocrite, that is like the crack|ling of thorns under a pot. The true chri&s;tian's joy and delight in God's word, ari&s;es more from its truth and goodne&s;s, than from the inward &s;eelings that ari&s;e therefrom. This is well expre&s;&s;ed by the prophet <HI>Habakuk, Though the fig-tree &s;hould not blo&s;|&s;om, and there &s;hould be no fruit found in the vine, yet I will rejoice in the Lord, and be glad in the God of my &s;alvation.</HI></P>
<P>THE per&s;ua&s;ion of the truth of the divine pro|mi&s;e, will cau&s;e the true fearer of God to rejoice when the inward &s;en&s;e and feeling is not &s;o lively experi|enced. The grounds of true devotion are without men and not within them: If we be only devout when we feel &s;uch and &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions upon our minds, &s;ome inward motions &s;tirring within us, our devotion will be very incon&s;tant; which &s;hould be always in exerci&s;e: That a per&s;on's hope may be as &s;ure, his confidence as well grounded, and his devotion as true, that rationally credits the divine te&s;timony, as he who will boa&s;t of raptures of &s;oul and exta&s;ies of delight. Enthu&s;ia&s;ts, like fooli&s;h children who find a bill or &s;um of money, are tran&s;|ported at the &s;ight of the &s;um, and cry they are rich and encrea&s;ed with goods, when the original proprietor will cau&s;e them make re&s;titution: But the devout &s;aint founds his joy upon his right, more than upon his pre&s;ent enjoyment, and can &s;ay, <HI>My God will &s;upply all my wants: I &s;urely &s;hall be &s;atis|fied
<PB N="43" REF="47">with thy abundant goodne&s;s.</HI> There is ordinarily this difference between enthu&s;ia&s;m and true devo|tion; the fir&s;t is more taken up with what it re|ceives, and what inward motions are felt, than con|templating the large pro&s;pect exhibited in the pro|mi&s;es of God: The latter makes one thankfull for every manife&s;tation, but at the &s;ame time makes him forget the things that are behind, and pre&s;s forward towards more di&s;coveries of divine love and favour. True devotion, as taught in the &s;crip|ture, makes men more generous, loving, chari|table, and kind; it opens the heart and unfolds the generous &s;entiments of the &s;oul. Enthu&s;ia&s;m makes men more narrow &s;pirited, uncharitable, cen&s;orious, and bigoted: <HI>Lord, I thank thee I am not as other men,</HI> is the language of their heart, and often of their tongue and conduct: But a truly devout &s;oul &s;peaks and acts with humility: <HI>I am le&s;s than the lea&s;t of all &s;aints, than the lea&s;t of all thy mercies.</HI> The truly devout per&s;on carefully ob&s;erves all divine &s;cripture connexions, and judges of the ideas by the warrant for them in divine revelation. When they are not connected with a moral warrant in the word of God, they are rejected as impertinent, and looked upon as a delu&s;ion: But the enthu&s;ia&s;t em|braces all ideas of plea&s;ing, without con&s;idering their connexion with the objects they &s;eem to repre&s;ent. Many dream plea&s;antly all their life, who meet with a dreadful awakening in the end, when God &s;ets the ju&s;t connexion of things before their eyes. Like men in a dream, that plea&s;e them&s;elves with eating and drinking, but when they awake, behold it is a dream. When we read or hear the word, we &s;hould be careful that our devotion take in ob|jects according to their true nature and de&s;ign, and improve them only for the purpo&s;es they were in|tended; that we may grow wi&s;er and better by all
<PB N="44" REF="48">the dictates of divine in&s;piration: <HI>For all &s;cripture is given by in&s;piration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, and in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>

<P>_GREAT and glorious things are &s;poken of the church in the New Te&s;tament times, and excellent things anent the increa&s;e of the Mediator's kingdom in that pe|riod. His appearances for his church have been always remarkable; but under the reign and go|vernment of the Me&s;&s;iah, the &s;plendor and maje&s;ty of the divine glory hath been mo&s;t con&s;picuous and eminent. The greater manife&s;tation of divine mercy and grace have been referred to the go&s;pel times. The promi&s;es made to the church, &s;eem to have a brighter view towards the latter days than in the fir&s;t periods of the church. From the be|ginning of this chapter we have a notable promi&s;e of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and peace to the church, down to the words of the text: Here we have the time &s;peci|fied when this &s;hould happen, and what figure the Redeemer &s;hould make in that remarkable day. Our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> is here called a root of <HI>Je&s;&s;e,</HI> becau&s;e till now he was hid from the world, as a root below ground, but now &s;prung up like a flouri&s;hing branch. When our Lord and Saviour appeared in this world, he was accounted by his
<PB N="46" REF="50">country men, the <HI>Jews,</HI> as a root out of a dry ground, having no form nor comeline&s;s to them. As &s;prung from <HI>Je&s;&s;e,</HI> he is called a root from him. It is promi&s;ed, <HI>He &s;hall be an en&s;ign of the people; and the Gentiles &s;hall &s;eek after him, and his re&s;t &s;hall be glorious.</HI> The expre&s;&s;ions are figurative, point|ing out the glory, peace, and &s;plendor of the church, under <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s power and government, and his eminence in the whole of her &s;alvation. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was an eminent type of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> when he entered into the tabernacle, for the glory of the Lord appeared then in great maje&s;ty: So when <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> entered the tabernacle of man's nature, the glory of the Lord appeared by the mini&s;try of angels to the &s;hep|herds, and at his bapti&s;m by a voice from heaven, and afterwards &s;hined forth in a very glorious man|ner upon mount <HI>Tabor</HI> at his transfiguration.</P>
<P>BY re&s;t is here meant the place of re&s;t, as the temple and tabernacle are called God's re&s;t, P&s;al. cxxxii. 14. <HI>This is my re&s;t, here will I &s;tay, for I have de&s;ired it:</HI> So <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> re&s;ts in his church according to his gracious pre&s;ence, and di&s;plays the glory or his grace and goodne&s;s. The words teach us, that in the days of the go&s;pel, <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as Lord and King or his church, &s;hall gather a numerous people to him&s;elf, and e&s;tabli&s;h a glorious and peaceable government among them; <HI>In that day there &s;hall be a root of Je&s;&s;e, which &s;hall &s;tand, &amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>THE fir&s;t thing was, to con&s;ider our Redeemer's character as here expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P N="1">1. I SHALL con&s;ider how, and to whom he bears this character: It is a metaphorical way of &s;peak|ing, taken from armies, and military order: As all li&s;ted &s;oldiers are obliged to follow their &s;tandard-bearer
<PB N="47" REF="51">and en&s;ign; &s;o every &s;oldier of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> mu&s;t and will follow <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and his cau&s;e. 1. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is an en&s;ign by divine commi&s;&s;ion and appointment. He hath the Father's commi&s;&s;ion to this office. The glorious Leader of the &s;aints did not enter upon his office without authority: He was no intruder, &s;o he tells us, <HI>He was &s;et up from everla&s;ting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.</HI> Had our Mediator taken upon him this office, without authority and commi&s;&s;ion, he would have been an u&s;urper, and would have had no authority nor &s;ecurity for acceptance of his work, nor any re|ward for it when fini&s;hed. He was not like the fal&s;e <HI>Chri&s;ts</HI> that came before him, that were thieves and robbers; but he came from the father as his commi&s;&s;ioned and &s;ent &s;ervant. <HI>I am not alone,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>but the Father that &s;ent me is with me.</HI> That <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was to be the en&s;ign of the people he mu&s;t have his commi&s;&s;ion &s;ealed; and it is &s;ealed with his Father's oath, <HI>I have &s;worn,</HI> &s;ays God, <HI>and will not repent, thou art a prie&s;t for ever. Chri&s;t</HI> as en|&s;ign of his church is King thereof; his &s;tandard is that of a King. His character as En&s;ign re&s;pects the evidence of his power; his character as king re&s;pects the authority with which he is inve&s;ted: This authority he receives from the Father, as him|&s;elf witne&s;&s;eth, John xiv. 31. <HI>As the Father gave me commandment, even &s;o I do.</HI> So he acknowledges as his &s;ervant, <HI>Thou art my &s;ervant, O I&s;rael, in whom I will be glorified,</HI> I&s;a. xlix. 3. And in all the prophecies of him, and promi&s;es anent him, he is &s;et forth as one having authority and a divine com|mi&s;&s;ion, as one having a command and rule; for, &s;ays God, <HI>I have given him as a leader and com|mander to the people,</HI> I&s;a. lv. 9. Our en&s;ign rules by a royal warrant and power; he took not this to him&s;elf, but acts as the Father's &s;ervant; and as our Mediator he bears this character through the
<PB N="48" REF="52">whole of the Old Te&s;tament. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> hath his com|mi&s;&s;ion confirmed two ways, by writ and by oath: He &s;ays, P&s;al. xl. 6.7, <HI>In the volume of thy book it is written of me.</HI></P>
<P>THE &s;criptures of the Old and New Te&s;tament are a volume where <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s commi&s;&s;ion is contain|ed, where his authority as en&s;ign of the church is declared. The &s;acrifices, types and figures, all pointed at <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> as one having authority from God, to di&s;charge this commi&s;&s;ion. The prophecies fore|told that he would be &s;uch a per&s;on; the promi&s;es &s;ecured this; <HI>Behold a king &s;hall reign in righteou&s;|ne&s;s,</HI> &s;ays the prophet, and &s;ays the Lord, <HI>I will bring forth my &s;ervant the Branch,</HI> Zech. iii. 8. The very fir&s;t promi&s;e of the go&s;pel pointed out <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> as one having authority, <HI>he &s;hall brui&s;e thy head.</HI></P>
<P>HE hath his commi&s;&s;ion al&s;o by &s;olemn oath; <HI>By two immutable things whereby it is impo&s;&s;ible for God to lie,</HI> that we might have &s;trong con&s;olation he hath confirmed it by his oath: And &s;peaking of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s kingly commi&s;&s;ion as a Mediator, P&s;al. cx. 4. he &s;ays, <HI>The Lord hath &s;worn, and will not repent;</HI> that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was to be governor and leader of his church: The Father gave him the &s;ure&s;t ground to re&s;t upon, for the acceptance of his &s;ervice and a&s;|&s;i&s;tance in his work: For this rea&s;on he hath &s;ealed his commi&s;&s;ion by writing and oath. This al&s;o is a &s;ure ground of chri&s;tian comfort in time of trial.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is the en&s;ign of the people by con&s;ecra|tion: He was con&s;ecrated to this office in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner: He was anointed to this office by the Holy Spirit, P&s;al. lxxxix. 20. <HI>I have found out David my &s;ervant: With my holy oil have I anointed him.</HI> As the en&s;ign of the church he received the &s;pirit without mea&s;ure: Hence, &s;ays the church, P&s;al. xlv. 7. <HI>God thy God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladne&s;s above thy fellows. Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> as God, could receive no addition of &s;piritual unction, becau&s;e he
<PB N="49" REF="53">was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of eternal fullne&s;s; but as the king of his church, and the leader of his people, he was qualified with a holy unction. This comprehends all his mediatory qualifications. In order that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hould be the king and lawgiver of his church, it was nece&s;&s;ary that the Spirit of the Lord &s;hould re&s;t upon him, as in the &s;econd ver&s;e of this chapter where our text lies. Hereby he was made of quick under&s;tanding in the fear of the Lord. That his government might be a righteous government, it was nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould be filled with the &s;pirit of righteou&s;ne&s;s: That he might fill all the ve&s;&s;els of his Father's hou&s;e, it was nece&s;&s;ary that in him all fullne&s;s &s;hould dwell. Moreover, <HI>Chri&s;t's</HI> human nature was con&s;ecrated with a &s;pecial con&s;ecration. That he might be holy, harmle&s;s, undefiled, and &s;e|parated from &s;inners, it was nece&s;&s;ary that his relati|on to men &s;hould not make him impure as they were. Had he not been pure, and holy, and con&s;ecrated as to his human nature, he could not have been an en&s;ign of holine&s;s. The &s;tately troops of kings and prie&s;ts that follow this glorious en&s;ign, mu&s;t be conformable to him in holine&s;s; and when he leads them it is in the ways of holine&s;s. Had he not been con&s;ecrated by a holy divine unction, he could not have been free of that pollution that was com|mon to all the po&s;terity of <HI>Adam.</HI> That his human nature might be free of all impurity, it was &s;anc|tified by the Holy Gho&s;t; this is witne&s;&s;ed by the angels to <HI>Mary,</HI> Luke i. 35. <HI>The power of the High|e&s;t &s;hall come upon thee; and the holy Thing which &s;hall be born of thee, &s;hall be called the Son of God. Chri&s;t</HI> that he might be the only en&s;ign of God to men, whom they ought to follow as their guide to glory, was con&s;ecrated in a threefold character, of prophet, prie&s;t, and king. His &s;tandard bears a relation to every branch of his character. The de&s;ign of a &s;tandard-bearer is to lead, to &s;ave, and conquer:
<PB N="50" REF="54"><HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was anointed for all the&s;e purpo&s;es. That he might in&s;truct and lead his followers in the ways of truth, he mu&s;t be a prophet, and con&s;ecrated for that purpo&s;e. There were only three degrees of dignity under the Old Te&s;tament, for which it was nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ecrate the per&s;ons inve&s;ted with it, by anointing them with oil, viz. prophets, prie&s;ts, and kings. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was anointed in all the&s;e three characters, as worthy of the dignity thereby con|ferred upon him, P&s;al. ii. 6. <HI>I have &s;et my king up|on my holy hill of Zion, with my holy oil have I a|nointed him.</HI> He hath given him to be a light to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and placed him a prince upon his thrones, con&s;ecrated him in all the&s;e offices.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> as the en&s;ign of the people, mu&s;t work out their &s;alvation: This he mu&s;t do by price as well as by power; and for this rea&s;on he mu&s;t be a prie&s;t as well as a king, and a &s;uffering Saviour According to the tenor of the covenant of grace, there was a price of redemption that our Redeemer <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> engaged to pay; a purcha&s;e he was to make of tho&s;e that were given him of the Father, <HI>When he &s;hall make his &s;oul an offering for &s;in, he &s;hall &s;ee his &s;eed.</HI> His offering him&s;elf as our High Prie&s;t, a &s;acrifice for our &s;ins, was a payment of that ran&s;om price he engaged to pay. To com|pleat our &s;alvation, it was nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould al&s;o be a king; and for this end came he into the world, that he might al&s;o &s;ubdue all his and our enemies. The fulfilling of this character in our text is a com|pleating of the conque&s;t over &s;in and Satan, that was promi&s;ed, P&s;al. cx. 6. <HI>He &s;hall judge among the heathen, he &s;hall fill the places with the dead bodies: he &s;hall wound the heads over many countries.</HI> For the&s;e purpo&s;es he was con&s;ecrated, that he might an&s;wer his character as the en&s;ign of the church.</P>
<P N="3">3. CHRIST is an en&s;ign by his own choice, and his peoples' con&s;ent. He willingly undertook this
<PB N="51" REF="55">office: When none among angels nor men could be found to &s;ave and lead the ruined po&s;terity of <HI>Adam,</HI> our Redeemer &s;ays, <HI>Lo I come, in the vo|lume of thy book it is written of me.</HI> With great chearfulne&s;s did our Redeemer embrace the office of a Saviour of his people. When he entered upon the execution of it, with what chearfulne&s;s and &s;atisfaction did he fulfil the duties belonging there|to. <HI>I have,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>a bapti&s;m to be bapti&s;ed with, and how am I &s;traitened till it be accompli&s;hed?</HI> He &s;et his face to go up to <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> with great ear|ne&s;tne&s;s and concern: It was as his meat and drink to do the will of his heavenly Father. He was free and voluntary; none could oblige him to engage on &s;uch an undertaking. He laid down his life for his &s;heep, which none could take from him: For he &s;ays, <HI>I have power to lay down my life, and power to take it up again.</HI> It was his own choice to be en|&s;ign of his people, and for this rea&s;on he &s;ubmitted to death it&s;elf, as an evidence of his great delight in his choice. Before he could rai&s;e up a &s;tandard of triumph, he mu&s;t fir&s;t engage to approach an ab|&s;olute God alone; <HI>Who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me, &s;aith the Lord?</HI> Jer. xxx. 21. And the Redeemer him&s;elf &s;ays, I&s;a. lxiii. 3. <HI>I have trodden the wine-pre&s;s alone, and of all the people there was none to help me.</HI></P>
<P>BUT he is al&s;o en&s;ign of the nations by the people's con&s;ent, P&s;al. cx. 3. <HI>Thy people &s;hall be wil|ling in the day of thy power.</HI> Though men by na|ture are enemies to God by wicked works, yet in the day of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s power they are made willing; they leave all and follow him, like his di&s;ciples whom he cho&s;e in the days of his fle&s;h. They con&s;ent to be governed by his laws, and delight in him as their law giver. Though in their uncon|verted &s;tate they might be ready to &s;ay, we will not have this man to rule over us, yet in the day
<PB N="52" REF="56">of e&s;pou&s;als and union to <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> they change their language, they &s;ay, <HI>The Lord is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, he is our king and will &s;ave us.</HI> The laws of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> are their &s;tudy, they account his yoke ea&s;y, and his burden light, and delight in the law of God after the inward man. His cro&s;s is al&s;o their glory; like the Apo&s;tle, they &s;ay, <HI>God forbid that I &s;hould glory, &s;ave in the cro&s;s of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whereby the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world,</HI> Gal. vi. 14. They make choice of his &s;tatutes as the men of their right hand, and pray that they may keep them; with holy <HI>David</HI> they &s;ay, <HI>Incline my heart to keep thy law.</HI> The paths of righteou&s;ne&s;s are their chief delight, <HI>I will run the ways of thy commandments, when thou ha&s;t en|larged my &s;teps,</HI> &s;ays the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t.</HI> The ordinances of God are their choice above all things, and they love the place where his honour dwells: They re|joice when it is &s;aid unto them, <HI>Go up into the hou&s;e of the Lord: Their hearts pant as the hart for the water brooks; and a day in God's court is better than a thou&s;and el&s;ewhere.</HI> Like <HI>David</HI> they will even en|vy the &s;wallows and &s;parrows that lodge in the &s;anctuary, when they cannot enjoy communion with <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> there.</P>
<P>THE promi&s;es of the covenant (of which <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is Mediator) are their choice, for comfort in their affliction, and rea&s;ons of triumph in their enlarge|ment. In their &s;orrowful moments, <HI>they draw wa|ter with joy out of the&s;e walls of &s;alvation,</HI> I&s;a. xii. 2, 3. and &s;uck comfort from the&s;e brea&s;ts of con&s;ola|tion. A true &s;aint can enjoy more comfort in a promi&s;e of the new covenant, than the worldly can from his corn, his wine, and oil: They can hope when their tribulation abounds, and &s;ay with the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t,</HI> P&s;al. cxix. 49, 51. <HI>In all my &s;traits I am revived by thy word alone.</HI> When one di&s;appoint|ment &s;ucceeds another, and temptation after tempta|tion
<PB N="53" REF="57">make them fall; yet they can &s;ay, <HI>One thing have I de&s;ired of the Lord, and that will I &s;eek after, that I may dwell in the hou&s;e of the Lord all the days of my life. Though I fall, I &s;hall ari&s;e; though I &s;it in darkne&s;s, the Lord &s;hall be a light unto me.</HI> The remembrance of his faithfulne&s;s in former experi|ences, makes them re&s;t in hope of the full fruition of all grace and glory with God for ever. More|over, they chu&s;e his people for their companions in the hou&s;e of their pilgrimage; the &s;ociety of good men they love and delight in: Whoever attends <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s &s;tandard, they love to follow. The poor followers of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> will afford them more &s;atisfaction, than the &s;ociety of princes or mini&s;ters of &s;tate, of an oppo&s;ite character.</P>
<P N="4">4. CHRIST bears his character by proclamation. He is proclaimed king in the church, his kingdom in the mo&s;t vi&s;ible manner. He is proclaimed in heaven, and proclaimed on earth. All the glori|fied &s;aints in heaven proclaim him en&s;ign of the people, <HI>Thou art worthy to receive glory, honour, and prai&s;e.</HI> The hallelujahs about the throne, are &s;o many proclamations to the glory and prai&s;e of the Redeemer as the en&s;ign of his people. Though we have but very faint conceptions of the manner of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s being proclaimed in heaven, in this our imperfect &s;tate, yet it is a truth, that all the heaven|ly ho&s;t proclaim him en&s;ign of the nations. King of &s;aints and king of nations, are &s;triking accents of their proclamation. In this proclamation all the heavenly ho&s;t are employed; there are no &s;pecta|tors there. The elders ca&s;t down their crowns at his feet and cry, <HI>Thou art worthy, for thou wa&s;t &s;lain and ha&s;t redeemed us to God by thy blood. Chri&s;t</HI> is proclaimed here by univer&s;al con&s;ent: Angels join with the &s;aints in this glorious work. An evidence of this we have, in their readine&s;s to proclaim him upon earth, when he came to the world as the en|&s;ign
<PB N="54" REF="58">of the nations. The&s;e mini&s;tering &s;pirits bring down the language of heaven to this world, and teach the militant church the manner of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s proclamation.</P>
<P>JESUS is al&s;o proclaimed on earth. The angels brought down a copy of the proclamation to the &s;hepherds, <HI>Glory to God in the highe&s;t, peace on earth, and good-will towards men,</HI> is the &s;ub&s;tance of this proclamation. The Apo&s;tles and mini&s;ters of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> have carried on this proclamation ever &s;ince: <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI> was the fir&s;t New Te&s;tament herald that took up this proclamation; he proclaimed him <HI>as the Lamb of God, that taketh away the &s;ins of the world.</HI> The go&s;pel is nothing but a proclamation of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> as the en&s;ign of the people. Tho&s;e who publi&s;h any other, in the go&s;pel proclamation, but <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> neither follow the copy of the angels, nor the practice of the triumphant church. <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as the glorious en&s;ign of the people, exhau&s;ts all the proclamations in heaven, and &s;hould fill up all the&s;e upon earth. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in the go&s;pel is proclaimed king and en&s;ign, in his grace and fullne&s;s, his power and glory. The go&s;pel is a proclamation of good and glad tidings to &s;inners, and it is only &s;o, as far as <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> the en&s;ign of the church is the &s;ub&s;tance of it. The go&s;pel proclaims <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> as an en&s;ign that liberates the captive, and &s;ets free the pri&s;oner, I&s;ai. lxi. 1. This might bring us more par|ticularly to con&s;ider, to whom he bears this cha|racter. I have through the whole of this di&s;cour&s;e viewed him as the en&s;ign of his church; but it may be nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider, what period of it our text more e&s;pecially refers to, and what people this office views more immediately.</P>
<P>IT is the Gentile church, more e&s;pecially, that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> bears this relation to. This will appear if we con&s;ider the name given to the Gentile church; &s;he is called the chri&s;tian church, and that becau&s;e
<PB N="55" REF="59">the members of it have enli&s;ted them&s;elves under <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s banner; becau&s;e they acknowledge <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> as the Lord and King of his church. When the <HI>Lord Je&s;us</HI> fir&s;t &s;et up the New Te&s;tament church, his name was the &s;tandard they adhered to: His name was the te&s;t what opinion men were of, whe|ther Heathen, Jew, or Chri&s;tian. Tho&s;e that owned the name of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> as the Saviour of the world, were called chri&s;tians, or members of the chri&s;tian church. The name of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was the &s;tandard to gather people to his cau&s;e, and it was promi&s;ed that the gathering of the people &s;hould be to him under the name of Shiloh. The Gentiles when they fir&s;t left pagani&s;m, were received in the chri&s;tian church by acknowledging the name of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> as the name whereby men only could be &s;aved. So the chri&s;ti|ans, in the fir&s;t days of chri&s;tianity, had <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s name written upon their colours, when they went out to war again&s;t the heathens; and none were re|ceived into their armies that did not own and ac|knowledge that name.</P>
<P>THIS was a very eminent fulfilment of the pro|mi&s;e in our text, <HI>That he &s;hould &s;tand as the en&s;ign of the people.</HI> The name of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was the en&s;ign of chri&s;tians in that period, and a literal fulfilment of this promi&s;e. This was the fir&s;t period our text re|fers to, and it is remarkable what progre&s;s <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s &s;tandard made in that period: <HI>The little cloud like a man's hand, &s;oon became great and covered the hea|vens: The handful of corn on the top of the mountain, &s;oon became like pro&s;perous fruit: Like trees on Le|banon.</HI> How admirable was it for a few fi&s;hermen publi&s;hing the name of their decea&s;ed ma&s;ter, &s;o to propagate chri&s;tianity, that in a few centuries the chri&s;tian name made no &s;mall part in the public &s;peculations and intere&s;ts of men. The name of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as the en&s;ign of the people, was the &s;tan|dard in the period of per&s;ecution. The name of
<PB N="56" REF="60"><HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was then the &s;tandard, under which the church &s;ealed her te&s;timony with her blood. In this period he was a bloody en&s;ign; his garments were &s;tained with blood. Tho&s;e who adhered to the name of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> &s;uffered the mo&s;t cruel barbarities; and his name was every where &s;poken again&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT even at this time the witne&s;&s;es of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> by adhering to his &s;tandard, overcame by the word of their te&s;timony. When the&s;e faithful witne&s;&s;es kept their eye upon <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as their glorious &s;tan|dard-bearer, they feared no danger, but &s;uffered chearfully. The connexion between <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s &s;tan|dard and victory, made the&s;e worthies &s;tand by their en&s;ign, and fall gloriou&s;ly. Moreover, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was the en&s;ign of his &s;ervants, who began and car|ried on our reformation from popery. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s &s;tan|dard was of another &s;ort. He was &s;till him&s;elf en|&s;ign of the people; but now his &s;tandard was for his &s;upremacy in his church. In the former pe|riods chri&s;tians contended for <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s name in ge|neral, in oppo&s;ition to pagani&s;m; but now they contend for his prie&s;tly and kingly offices. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was an en&s;ign again&s;t heatheni&s;m at fir&s;t, but now he takes the field again&s;t antichri&s;t. <HI>Je&s;us</HI> as the Lord, our righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;alvation, was the &s;tan|dard-bearer again&s;t popi&s;h works, pardons, and indulgencies, and again&s;t the tyranny of the Ro|mi&s;h bea&s;t, over the &s;ouls and con&s;ciences of men. Now the truth of his imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s, as the ground of our hope before God, was the &s;tandard to hold by or de&s;ert. His authority, as the alone en&s;ign of his &s;aints, was now the matter of te&s;ti|mony. Now it was, that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> the en&s;ign of his people, &s;pirited a multitude of his &s;ervants to op|po&s;e the&s;e ab&s;urd and antichri&s;tian abominations. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was now en&s;ign again&s;t his implacable ad|ver&s;ary, the Man of Sin: His &s;tandard was now in oppo&s;ition to this murderer of &s;ouls. The oppo|&s;ers
<PB N="57" REF="61">of the&s;e antichri&s;tian abominations, did not promi&s;e great things to their followers; they only proclaimed their king, and &s;hewed his colours. People were not at this period under compul&s;ion to follow <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s &s;tandard for fear of rack and tor|ture: The followers of the lamb u&s;ed no &s;uch car|nal weapons, nor Mahometan engines: They u&s;ed no force, but the evidence of their en&s;ign's right to men's &s;ervices, and the advantages to be ob|tained under his banner. They di&s;played their banners in the name of the Lord; and when they fell in his cau&s;e, it was be&s;ide his &s;tandard. This was a remarkable period, when <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s glory was made great as the en&s;ign of his people; &s;o great was the evidence of his power, that his &s;tandard made the powers of hell and <HI>Rome</HI> to &s;hake.</P>
<P>BUT the words of our text may yet look forward to the latter days, when <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> &s;hall be|come one, and li&s;t them&s;elves under <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s banner, as the en&s;ign of the people. The conver&s;ion of the <HI>Jews</HI> &s;eems to be pointed at in the ver&s;e following our text, <HI>And the Lord &s;hall &s;et his hand the &s;econd time, to gather his people that are &s;cattered, &amp;c.</HI> Then &s;hall <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> be an en&s;ign to all nations, both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles:</HI> The cro&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hall be no longer a &s;tumbling block to the <HI>Jews,</HI> but they &s;hall flock to his &s;tandard, and &s;ubmit to his govern|ment: <HI>As the Gentiles &s;hall &s;eek to his &s;tandard from afar, &s;o &s;hall al&s;o the Jews, and great &s;hall be the peace of the kingdom.</HI> The glory of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> as the King of his church, &s;hall in the&s;e days be far more evident and con&s;picuous, when out of all nations and kingdoms, his brethren according to the fle&s;h &s;hall &s;eek after him. Whether <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hall bring that ancient people into their own land, and place them in a &s;tate of civil government, I &s;hall not take upon me to determine; though it may be pre&s;umed that it will be &s;o, from many promi&s;es of the Old
<PB N="58" REF="62">Te&s;tament, and &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in the New, as Ezek. xxvi. 7, 24, 25, 26. The&s;e promi&s;es were not wholly fulfilled at their return from the <HI>Babyloni&s;h</HI> captivity, becau&s;e at this very day they are a re|proach among the nations whither they are &s;cattered abroad. But when they are brought again into their own land, in that day the promi&s;e refers to, they &s;hall be no more a reproach to the nations, and the heathen about them. It is promi&s;ed they &s;hall dwell in their own land, and enjoy the promi&s;ed ble&s;&s;ings of the new covenant; but this they have not yet done; therefore it is rea&s;onable to think that they &s;hall yet have a glorious kingdom, both as a church and &s;tate.</P>
<P>UNDER the reign of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> the drying up of the river <HI>Euphrates</HI> is prophe&s;ied of, which &s;eems to refer to that glorious day, when <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hall be the en&s;ign to both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles.</HI> The <HI>Mahometans,</HI> that now po&s;&s;e&s;s their land, &s;hall fall at the battle of <HI>Armagiddon;</HI> and it is probable that the <HI>Jews</HI> &s;hall enjoy their own old po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in that day. Be this as it will, it is certain, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hall be the en&s;ign of his people after all the&s;e commo|tions are at an end: <HI>And he &s;hall &s;tand as an en&s;ign of the people; to him &s;hall the Gentiles &s;eek, and his re&s;t &s;hall be glorious.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Head</HI> 2. To con&s;ider the ble&s;&s;ing of re&s;t, pro|mi&s;ed under <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s government.</P>
<P N="1">1. WE may con&s;ider the glory of the go&s;pel church in the purity of her doctrines, wor&s;hip, and the number of her converts. She is glorious in the purity and &s;implicity of her doctrine. Every thing nece&s;&s;ary to be believed and practi&s;ed are pure and plain, P&s;al. xix. 7. <HI>The law of the Lord is pure.</HI> The te&s;timony God hath given of him&s;elf in the go&s;pel, as our God and Saviour, is mo&s;t pure and plain. God's declaration in his word of
<PB N="59" REF="63">peace, are free of every tendency to impurity. Where the doctrines of the go&s;pel are believed, they will i&s;&s;ue in holine&s;s. There is no tendency in any article of the chri&s;tian religion to impurity. The more &s;trong the faith of a chri&s;tian is, the &s;tricter will his life be. If we may judge of a cau&s;e from its effects, we cannot but be per&s;uaded that the doctrines of faith are pure, when all true believers of the&s;e doctrines are a holy people. Though many profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tianity live bad lives, it is no argument again&s;t its doctrines, but an evidence that they are un&s;ound believers: For if they believed the purity of its doctrines, they would &s;tudy to conform their lives to its holy precepts.</P>
<P>DID men believe God's te&s;timony anent a wicked world, <HI>That it &s;hall be ill with the wicked, for they &s;hall eat the fruit of their doings,</HI> is it po&s;&s;ible they could any longer live either indolent or bad lives? The very de&s;ign of the Almighty's revealing to men the danger of &s;in, and the &s;tate they naturally are in, is that they may believe it, and turn from it to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in a pure and holy manner. In the fir&s;t chapter of this prophecy, he &s;ets before <HI>I&s;rael</HI> a de&s;cription of their ruined &s;tate and condition; and in the 18th ver&s;e, &s;hews the rea&s;on of this awful de|claration; namely, That they might be holy, <HI>Though your &s;ins be as &s;carlet, they &s;hall be white as wool; though they be as crim&s;on, they &s;hall be like &s;now.</HI> Moreover, the&s;e doctrines are delivered in the mo&s;t &s;imple and plain manner, free of all &s;u|per&s;tition and gaudy ornament. They are &s;et forth as they really are, true and pure. Though we have in the &s;criptures lofty de&s;criptions of the power and maje&s;ty of God, beyond the parallel of human rhetoric; yet all the grounds of faith and rules of practice, are expre&s;t in the plaine&s;t and mo&s;t &s;imple manner. We are indeed obliged to believe many things we cannot fully comprehend, as being be|yond
<PB N="60" REF="64">our full reach in this imperfect &s;tate; yet, properly &s;peaking, we are not called to believe any thing beyond the reach of our capacity: For what is the ground of our faith, is the te&s;timony and declaration of God; which any per&s;on of common under&s;tanding may comprehend as a truth, though he cannot comprehend all the properties of the object revealed, nor all the rea&s;ons of the truth declared.</P>
<P>THE rea&s;on of our belief is clear and plain, the pure and perfect law of God. And if we believe that God is, and that he is an ab&s;olutely perfect being; then his declaration is &s;ufficient to a&s;&s;ure us, that any thing not repugnant to rea&s;on is true, though it be above our pre&s;ent capacity. God can|not deceive us; therefore to believe his word can never be un&s;afe, but profitable. Mu&s;t not then the church be very glorious in point of faith, when &s;he is certain that in believing God's word &s;he cannot err? What the church of <HI>Rome</HI> fal&s;ely a&s;&s;umes to her&s;elf, the church of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> may with certainty claim as her privilege, namely, infallibility in faith: But then the articles are not of her own framing, but framed by the &s;pirit of God; they derive not their authority from her&s;elf, but from her God and Saviour. This is an excellent branch of glory be|longing to the church of God, that her faith is &s;ure and certain, and the doctrines upon which it is founded mo&s;t pure and true. They are free from the vain additions of men; have their authority imme|diately from the Almighty, and are neither more or le&s;s true or fal&s;e, pure and holy, by the &s;anction of men or the authority of churches. In this the New Te&s;tament church has by far the advantage of the Old; as every chri&s;tian may believe for him&s;elf, and embrace the doctrines of religion, without in|curring the divine di&s;plea&s;ure for not agreeing with any national e&s;tabli&s;hment. In matters of the mo&s;t
<PB N="61" REF="65">&s;olemn nature, the wor&s;hippers of God then, could not approach unto him but by the intervention of prie&s;ts and &s;acrifices, and were not allowed to enter within the vail; but chri&s;tians, under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, may approach unto <HI>the holie&s;t of all by the blood of Je&s;us,</HI> and offer the &s;acrifices of prai&s;e and thank&s;giving to God, without the in|tervention of prie&s;t or clergyman. The true be|liever under the go&s;pel, may &s;ee the purity of doc|trine, and the evidence thereof as the ground and rule of faith, as it were at fir&s;t hand; whereas the&s;e worthies had a long train of mediums to look through, that were dark in them&s;elves, and but &s;hadows in compari&s;on of what we now enjoy. The di&s;coveries of the go&s;pel are farther advanced beyond the&s;e under the law, than all the modern di&s;co|coveries in philo&s;ophy are beyond the ancient.</P>
<P>THE doctrines anent the re&s;toration of men into the divine favour, are pure and &s;piritual: The &s;ouls of true believers may enjoy communion with God thereby, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his grace, without any &s;econd editions from men or churches. Men now may make free with the promi&s;es, without a&s;king liberty from prie&s;t or prophet. No per&s;on or per|&s;ons what&s;oever can be lords of our faith or con|&s;ciences. The doctrines of &s;alvation now run in a a free channel, which is the great glory of the chri&s;tian church: Every man may now judge and believe for him&s;elf. Helps in the practice of reli|gion we may and ought to have, but lords over our faith and con&s;cience we cannot have, without de&s;troying our chri&s;tian liberty. The New Te&s;ta|ment church is glorious in this re&s;pect, as every member, in what he is to believe and practi&s;e for &s;alvation, is alike free. No worldly power or dig|nity can give more or le&s;s liberty in matters of faith and practice. The poore&s;t per&s;on that lives is as free in this re&s;pect as either kings or emperors.
<PB N="62" REF="66">This liberty ari&s;es from the truths them&s;elves that teach it. Hence chri&s;tian liberty is not founded upon the permi&s;&s;ion of churches and legi&s;lators, but upon the authority of God, expre&s;&s;ed in the doc|trines of his word. Every private chri&s;tian has now the glorious freedom and liberty of reading the &s;acred oracles in his own language, and of under&s;tanding and believing them as he is able, without being account|able to any but God him&s;elf. The doctrine of ju&s;tification, through the imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> without the works of the law, is purely and clearly taught in the go&s;pel church: No mixture of popi&s;h works and pardons is joined with this me|ritorious cau&s;e of our &s;alvation; <HI>This pure water of life is clear like cry&s;tal,</HI> Rev. xxii. 1. The promi&s;es of life and &s;alvation, are opened up in the&s;e glori|ous days of re&s;t in the church, as containing our ground of acceptance with God, and the cau&s;e of our meetne&s;s for eternal life. What <HI>Je&s;us</HI> did and &s;uffered, and that he died and ro&s;e again, is freely &s;et forth in the go&s;pel: Nothing but plain truth is there publi&s;hed, free from the di&s;gui&s;e of the en|ticing words of man's wi&s;dom: No conceits of de|&s;igning men are joined with the&s;e doctrines, nor mixed with the hi&s;tory of the life of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> but a pure declaration of what he did and &s;uffered; and for what end and purpo&s;e is exhibited in the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>No great things are required of men to come at the&s;e benefits which <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> purcha&s;ed to his people, only faith in <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> and in what he did is required, which is al&s;o promi&s;ed. For this purpo&s;e God hath promi&s;ed his &s;pirit to a&s;&s;i&s;t us, Ezek. xxxvi. 27. <HI>I will put my &s;pirit within you, &amp;c.</HI> The two Te&s;taments are &s;o pure and &s;imple, and free of ob|&s;curity, that no objection can be ju&s;tly made again&s;t them, either from them&s;elves or the manner they are delivered. We have truths told us, by men who could have no de&s;ign to impo&s;e upon the world,
<PB N="63" REF="67">and confirmed by the divine approbation, in work|ing of miracles of &s;upport the evidence of the&s;e doc|trines. Many of the things them&s;elves are facts that none could deny; but in the way, contradicting them&s;elves. When the <HI>Jews</HI> attempted to deny the re&s;urrection of our Saviour, what a foul blun|der did they fall into; they de&s;ired the &s;oldiers to &s;ay that the di&s;ciples &s;tole him away when they &s;lept: But how could they be evidences when they were a&s;leep? Mu&s;t not &s;uch a cau&s;e be bad that needs &s;uch evidence to &s;upport it.</P>
<P>THE go&s;pel church will appear glorious, if we con&s;ider the&s;e rules of practice that are given her for her ob&s;ervation. This comprehends all divine commandments and in&s;titutions. Under the go&s;|pel we have a beautiful &s;y&s;tem of moral precepts, freed from all the ceremony of the figurative pe|riod: Laws in them&s;elves, founded in the nature of things, and tending to the happine&s;s of &s;uch as obey them, are clearly taught in the divine law; a brief &s;um of which we have in the two great command|ments mentioned by our Saviour; <HI>Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and thy neigh|bour as thy&s;elf.</HI> This he more fully explains in his excellent &s;ermon on the mount: There he &s;hews what he expects from &s;uch as follow him, and what they &s;hall enjoy by a &s;incere ob&s;ervation of his com|mandments. The way of keeping the command|ments is the way to heaven, though not the pro|curing cau&s;e of our admi&s;&s;ion. The &s;y&s;tem of moral duties under <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s government is more &s;pi|ritual than under the law, and no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary though le&s;s grievous. The temper and di&s;po&s;ition of mind on which a chri&s;tian di&s;charges his duty, comprehending principle, motives and end, is more regarded by God than the pompous way of doing of it&punc; The glory of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s government in his church, is very remarkable for the &s;weetne&s;s and
<PB N="64" REF="68">ea&s;ine&s;s of his yoke; <HI>His yoke is ea&s;y, and his burthen light.</HI> That ble&s;&s;ed &s;y&s;tem of rules he hath laid down, and corroberates by his own example, is an ea&s;y and delightful path for his followers to walk in. What makes this yoke ea&s;y is, it being in his own hand; Scribes, Phari&s;ees, and lawyers, have now no right, <HI>To bind heavy burthens upon men's &s;houlders:</HI> No &s;et of men have authority from <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to force men to religious duties, nor to add a heavy yoke of additional human inventions, to the ordi|nances of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> The kindly Redeemer impo&s;es the yoke of duty, and lays on the burthen of obli|gation him&s;elf; which he enables his people to bear by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Holy Spirit. When the rules of practice among the <HI>Jews</HI> came through the hands of Rabbies and Prie&s;ts, what a heavy yoke did the people groan under? The law of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> by them was augmented to a mon&s;trous &s;ize, and the duties impo&s;ed by them upon the people were beyond all po&s;&s;ibility of ob&s;ervation. The&s;e dicta|torial Levites knew how to impo&s;e burthens upon the people, but were ignorant how to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the way of bearing them. It is a great mercy to the chri&s;tian church that &s;he is, by right from <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> out of the domineering hands of prie&s;ts and clergy|men. She now receives her laws from <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> him|&s;elf, who has the bowels of a parent, and the mercy of a God; and is not <HI>A &s;evere ma&s;ter, who reaps where he hath not &s;own.</HI> Under the government of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> the King of his church, his &s;ubjects &s;erve him without fear. The admini&s;tration of the Me|diator is free of terror; for his people by him, <HI>Be|ing delivered out of the hands of their enemies, &s;erve him without fear all the days of their life.</HI> There was much terror at giving the law upon mount <HI>Sinai, &s;o that Mo&s;es exceedingly feared and quaked;</HI> and all along there was &s;omething of terror attended that di&s;pen&s;ation. The law was given with thun|der,
<PB N="65" REF="69">and repeated with cur&s;es; and &s;undry remark|able examples of divine vengeance were &s;een for the breach of &s;ome po&s;itive laws in that period. But under the go&s;pel mercy reigns through righteou&s;|ne&s;s by <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> our Lord.</P>
<P>DIVINE laws now more immediately re&s;pect the con&s;ciences of men, and that vi&s;ible &s;everity which appeared in the fir&s;t di&s;pen&s;ation is &s;weetly tempered with grace under the government of the Me&s;&s;iah. If we view the ordinances and in&s;titu|tions of the chri&s;tian church, &s;he will appear glo|rious. The ea&s;ine&s;s of their performance, the happine&s;s of their tendency, adds a con&s;iderable lu&s;tre to the&s;e in&s;titutions. The ordinance of preach|ing the go&s;pel, whereby peace and pardon is pub|li&s;hed to &s;inners, is a noble and glorious privilege of the go&s;pel church: This in&s;titution, as appointed by <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> is glad tidings to all people: A gra|cious de&s;ign of heaven revealed to men, and a te&s;timony of God's &s;atisfaction with what <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> hath done. In the go&s;pel God &s;peaks to men from a throne of grace, and declares his mercy to &s;in|ners through his beloved &s;on.</P>
<P>THE go&s;pel pre&s;ents us with a more benign di&s;|covery of the Deity; his goodne&s;s, grace, and mercy &s;hine illu&s;triou&s;ly through this di&s;pen&s;ation. God draws men now near him in the way of love, and the true go&s;pel faith in God, as in <HI>Je&s;us</HI> recon|ciled, <HI>is a faith that works by love.</HI> The amiable character of the Deity is repre&s;ented in this di&s;pen|&s;ation of the Redeemer's power; and the go&s;pel method of &s;aving &s;inners is a per&s;uading them to embrace <HI>Je&s;us</HI> as revealed in divine revelation, <HI>As made of God unto us wi&s;dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;anctifica|tion, and redemption.</HI> The language of the go&s;pel is, <HI>I am pacified towards you, for all the ill that thou ha&s;t done.</HI> The character of God in the go&s;pel ap|pears propitious to men, as he has declared his &s;a|tisfaction
<PB N="66" REF="70">with what <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> hath done for their &s;ins, through his obedience. The character of our Me|diator as God in our nature, con&s;titutes a friend|&s;hip between heaven and earth.</P>
<P>IN the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, the great rewards laid up for them that love God are beautifully opened up and di&s;played. That the &s;aints &s;hall enjoy everla&s;ting re&s;t in the favour of God through eternity, is clearly revealed in the go&s;pel. The prophet tells us, <HI>That eye hath not &s;een, nor ear heard, nor hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive what God hath laid up for them that fear him.</HI> And what was hid from ages and generations is now brought to light by the go&s;pel, even life and im|mortality. In this di&s;pen&s;ation of the Redeemer's government there al&s;o appears the greate&s;t purity and holine&s;s, as men are &s;aved in the way of vin|dicating the purity and holine&s;s of the divine cha|racter, by forming the minds of believers into the likene&s;s of God. This go&s;pel, though it repre&s;ents God as gracious to &s;uch as accept of his &s;on, yet it te&s;tifies that he is holy and ju&s;t in puni&s;hing ob|&s;tinate unbelievers.</P>
<P>THE go&s;pel is pure in all its offers and promi&s;es; it offers &s;alvation to the guilty and unclean, but be&s;tows it in the way of wa&s;hing and clean&s;ing them from all their iniquities; <HI>The blood of Je&s;us, his &s;on, clean&s;eth them from all &s;in.</HI> The very offer of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> contains holine&s;s in the nature of it, as the cha|racter in which he is offered te&s;tifies; <HI>For he is made of God to us, &s;anctification and redemption.</HI></P>
<P>THESE ordinances of bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper, hold forth the glorious purity of the king|dom of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and that his re&s;t is glorious. Bap|ti&s;m points out a purification from the pollution of &s;in by the blood of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> and all per&s;ons to whom this ordinance is ble&s;t and &s;anctified, are wa&s;hed from the guilt of &s;in, <HI>And purified from dead works to &s;erve
<PB N="67" REF="71">the living God.</HI> The in&s;titution of the &s;upper acquaints us with the livelie&s;t picture of &s;trict holine&s;s, as therein <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is repre&s;ented as cruci&s;ied, that a holy people might by that death enjoy communion with a holy Lord God. The very &s;igni&s;ication of this ordinance is holine&s;s; for the blood of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> therein &s;hewed forth, is blood <HI>that clean&s;eth from all &s;in,</HI> and &s;uch as partake of that ordinance oblige them&s;elves to war again&s;t <HI>the devil, the world, and the fle&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is a glorious privilege of the New Te&s;ta|ment church, that the friends of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> may eat and drink in his pre&s;ence, clothed with his pure and &s;potle&s;s righteou&s;ne&s;s. The &s;piritual nature of this ordinance is to nouri&s;h the &s;oul in holine&s;s, and to &s;trengthen the faith of believers in every word of promi&s;ed goodne&s;s. There is a more full and perfect repre&s;entation of divine goodne&s;s and grace in the &s;acrament of the &s;upper, than was in the pa&s;&s;over of old. The Old Te&s;tament &s;aints did eat in the pre&s;ence of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> but did not drink, better things being re&s;erved for us; but this or|dinance points out that perfect &s;atisfaction and joy in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> by a full repre&s;entation of all that figures forth &s;atisfaction, or is needful for nouri&s;hment, viz. eating and drinking. In this holy ordinance believers &s;it, and eat, and drink with <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> at his table, by faith, and as it were are brought to a &s;tate of re&s;t, when compared with the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> church: They did eat the pa&s;&s;over with <HI>their &s;taff in their hand,</HI> as ready to enter upon a journey, but the church now, in token of a more glorious re&s;t, is allowed to &s;it, and both to eat and drink, as an evidence of a more perfect &s;tate.</P>
<P>IN point of all parts of wor&s;hip the church of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is glorious. Believers are not now confined to any one place to wor&s;hip God, but <HI>in all places them that fear God and work righteou&s;ne&s;s, are accept|ed.</HI>
<PB N="68" REF="72">There is a glorious freedom of acce&s;s to God through <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> at all times and in all places. The <HI>Jews</HI> had to go up to <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> once every year to keep the pa&s;&s;over, and no place but that <HI>which the Lord had cho&s;en</HI> was accounted acceptable: But under the go&s;pel, chri&s;tians are freed from that con|finement. We may con&s;ider the glory of the New Te&s;tament church in the number of her converts: That promi&s;e, <HI>More are the children of the de&s;olate than of the married woman,</HI> has been in a great mea&s;ure fulfilled: This is clear from the beginning and progre&s;s of this branch of the church's glory. It began with great &s;ucce&s;s; a nation, as it were, was born at once. After the out-pouring of the &s;pirit upon the day of <HI>Penteco&s;t,</HI> after our Lord's a&s;cen|&s;ion into heaven, multitudes were converted to chri&s;tianity; and <HI>Satan</HI>'s kingdom was made to &s;hake. Such was the powerful evidence that at|tended the doctrines of the go&s;pel, that no power of prejudice could oppo&s;e it: Its truth was &s;o powerful and convincing, that men, over the belly of intere&s;t and plea&s;ure, became followers of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> and &s;ubjects of his kingdom. Men at this time broke through the &s;tronge&s;t connexions of relation and friend&s;hip, and joined them&s;elves to the church; <HI>They le&s;t father and mother, &s;i&s;ter and brother, and followed Chri&s;t.</HI> Worldly intere&s;t, that has the mo&s;t powerful influence over the conduct of men, could not hinder the primitive chri&s;tians to embrace chri&s;tianity: If they had friends they left them, if po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions they &s;old them, and went over all dif|ficulties to add to the number of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s &s;oldiers. Even in <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> where <HI>Je&s;us</HI> was crucified, there was a numerous multitude of converts to the go&s;|pel church: <HI>Peter,</HI> at one &s;ermon, converted three thou&s;and; and <HI>John,</HI> by another, five thou&s;and. Never under any former di&s;pen&s;ation do we hear of &s;uch a number of converts &s;o &s;oon made, and in
<PB N="69" REF="73">oppo&s;ition to &s;o many prejudices. This was a glory referred to the days of the go&s;pel, <HI>when Chri&s;t &s;hould &s;tand as the en&s;ign of the people:</HI> This was a glory de&s;igned for <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s New Te&s;tament &s;pou&s;e, and a crown <HI>wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his e&s;pou&s;als.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN we con&s;ider the oppo&s;ition chri&s;tianity met with, this beginning will appear glorious. No device of man was wanting, nor force to &s;uppre&s;s the dawning of this glory. The <HI>Jews</HI> expre&s;t the utmo&s;t fury and malice again&s;t the primitive chri&s;|tians: The rulers of the <HI>Jews</HI> &s;uppre&s;t it all they could; <HI>They &s;toned Stephen to death, and &s;lew James with the &s;word:</HI> They &s;courged others and treated them cruelly; but all this could not hinder the increa&s;e of the church's glory, nor the number of her converts; <HI>The more they were oppre&s;&s;ed, they mul|tiplied and grew.</HI> That the number of converts &s;hould increa&s;e in oppo&s;ition to all human oppre&s;|&s;ion, and laws made again&s;t chri&s;tianity, is an evi|dence of the glorious power of the grace of the Redeemer, operating upon the minds of men by the go&s;pel. There were no promi&s;es nor pro&s;pect of worldly advantages that attended this religion to incline men to embrace it, but on the contrary they were forewarned that lo&s;&s;es and per&s;ecution &s;hould be their lot. Could any thing but the glo|rious evidence of divine truth, per&s;uade men to engage in a cau&s;e, where they were &s;ure of nothing in this world but trouble and per&s;ecution? Yet &s;o it was, that at the very beginning the church was glorious in the number of her converts. As the beginning of chri&s;tianity was glorious, &s;o the pro|gre&s;s it made was remarkable. <HI>That handful of corn upon the top of the mountains &s;oon began to &s;hake with pro&s;perous fruit, like the trees in Lebanon.</HI> Tho&s;e few apo&s;tles and converts at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> by the per|&s;ecution that aro&s;e there, were &s;cattered abroad,
<PB N="70" REF="74">and preaching the go&s;pel to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> converted multitudes to the faith of <HI>Je&s;us.</HI> In a &s;hort time the number of chri&s;tians multiplied to &s;uch a de|gree, that they became con&s;iderable in the world, and bare no &s;mall proportion in &s;undry parts of the empire: The glory of the church of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> went out through the nations, and &s;he became ter|rible as an army with banners. Even <HI>Kings became nur&s;ing fathers, and Queens nur&s;ing mothers</HI> to the church: Then <HI>her glory went out through all the earth,</HI> and the promi&s;e in our text was punctually fulfilled; <HI>For his re&s;t was glorious.</HI></P>
<P>THE powers of darkne&s;s, as the go&s;pel made progre&s;s, gave way, and were not able to with&s;tand its power, nor to keep tho&s;e that were under their influence. Such was the glory of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s power in his carrying on his work in the church, that it di&s;pelled the darkne&s;s wherever it came: <HI>Satan fell as lightning to the ground</HI> before it. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> now <HI>triumphed over principalities and powers,</HI> and reigned in his church, <HI>and &s;hined forth before his ancients gloriou&s;ly.</HI> The glory of this progre&s;s of religion appears in the liberty and freedom of it. There was no force nor compul&s;ion u&s;ed to bring men over to chri&s;tianity: All the new converts to the go&s;pel enli&s;ted them&s;elves freely under <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s ban|ner. In this day of the Redeemer's power his people <HI>were willing,</HI> and chri&s;tians agreed in one to make <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> their head. The new converts to the chri&s;tian religion, having freely and voluntarily en|gaged in the &s;ervice of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> they &s;erved him with re&s;olution and chearfulne&s;s; and by having their hearts bent upon his &s;ervice, became <HI>good &s;oldiers of Je&s;us Chri&s;t:</HI> They became &s;o expert in the chri&s;tian warfare, and &s;o re&s;olute in the &s;ervice of their ma&s;ter, that neither force nor fraud could overcome their fortitude. Then it was that the church <HI>looked fair as the &s;un, and terrible as an army
<PB N="71" REF="75">with banners. Sons and daughters were</HI> brought forth in the church out of all nations; and &s;he was glorious, as being the mother of many children to <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> As the primitive chri&s;tians were the fol|lowers of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> by free choice, &s;o they never com|pelled any to chri&s;tianity again&s;t their will: Force and compul&s;ion were left to <HI>Mahomedans</HI> and their imitators: <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s people were free and willing them&s;elves, and wanted none but &s;uch as were wil|ling to embrace their fellow&s;hip. Civil authority had not yet got footing among chri&s;tians; nor was religion as yet ingrafted upon the &s;tate. The ori|ginal pattern of the religion of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> was pure and undefiled, neither mixed with human inventions, nor attended with &s;ecular awe, intere&s;t or plea&s;ure. The acknowledgment of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> as dead and ri&s;en again, and a&s;cended into heaven, and as the only Lord of his church, was all the confe&s;&s;ion of faith required of new converts: They had not yet learn|ed the method of creed-making, nor the art of forging canons to bind men's con&s;ciences: Liberty was well under&s;tood, and faithfully practi&s;ed as yet. It was when churches began to model them&s;elves after the manner of monarchies and &s;tates, that creed-making came in fa&s;hion: When intere&s;t and ea&s;e were the attendants of religion, it was found nece&s;&s;ary to guard the privilege again&s;t being o|ver&s;tocked.</P>
<P>So long as liberty was under&s;tood and practi&s;ed, religion encrea&s;ed, and chri&s;tianity flouri&s;hed; di|vi&s;ions were unknown, and love among brethren prevailed: But when once pride and ambition made men gra&s;p at power, liberty was enfringed, love abated, and divi&s;ions commenced. No &s;ooner did chri&s;tians deviate from primitive freedom and li|berty, than the glory of the church was defaced. <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as the en&s;ign of the people, never intended any force in his &s;y&s;tem of government; all his &s;ub|jects
<PB N="72" REF="76">mu&s;t be willing, otherwi&s;e they are not ac|ceptable. The peace and harmony of the church depends upon her liberty, for without it there can be no true peace: When men are confined in their way of thinking in religion by others, they never will live in harmony: For every chri&s;tian having the &s;ame privilege from <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> can never &s;ee the propriety of others depriving them of it without his authority. The promi&s;e in our text, looks for|ward to a time of liberty and peace, when the peace of the children of God &s;hall be great; when brotherly love &s;hall continue; when the hearts of chri&s;tians &s;hall be opened to receive one another with love, and &s;hall not longer &s;hut their fellow-chri&s;tians out of their affections, from an attachment to &s;ome peculiar way of thinking. When this glory of the latter day is made to &s;hine, men &s;hall not longer judge their brethren, nor &s;eek to &s;quare their con|&s;ciences by their own rules, but allow them to live and believe as the word of God directs them: Then &s;hall that promi&s;e be amply fulfilled, Ezek. xxxiv. 25. <HI>They &s;hall dwell &s;afely in the wilderne&s;s, and &s;leep in the woods. For in that day there &s;hall be a root of Je&s;&s;e, which &s;hall &s;tand for an en&s;ign of the people; to it &s;hall the Gentiles &s;eek, and his re&s;t &s;hall be glorious.</HI></P>
<P>I SHALL now conclude this &s;ubject with a very &s;hort improvement.</P>
<P N="1">1. From what has been &s;aid, we may &s;ee, that our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> an&s;wers his character given him in our text, as the en&s;ign of the people. <HI>He has lifted up a &s;tandard to the nations from afar</HI> in the go&s;pel, and revealed him&s;elf <HI>as the captain of our &s;alvation.</HI> He <HI>leads his people into all truth,</HI> as their leader, and <HI>as the captain of their &s;alvation</HI> directs them in all their &s;piritual warfare, defends them again&s;t the force and fraud of all their &s;pi|ritual enemies. The experience of all believers
<PB N="73" REF="77">from the beginning until now, can witne&s;s that <HI>Je|&s;us</HI> fulfills this character; <HI>David</HI> could &s;ay, <HI>My foot had well nigh &s;lipt, but the Lord held me up; and unle&s;s the Lord had been my help when I was oppre&s;|&s;ed, my &s;oul had remained in the hou&s;e of &s;ilence.</HI> Whoever follows <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as the en&s;ign of the people, will find that he an&s;wers his character; for he leads them &s;afely to the borders of his &s;anctuary, and gives them the victory over all their &s;piritual ene|mies. Tho&s;e who make choice of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> for their leader, will certainly be &s;afe; for he has infinite power to uphold them, to protect and deliver them; <HI>He has an arm that is full of power, his hand is great in might. Tho&s;e who tru&s;t in him &s;hall never be moved, but be like mount Zion, endureth for ever.</HI> As to the evidence of his character, as the leader and en&s;ign of the people, even his enemies have been obliged to acknowledge it. The <HI>Jews,</HI> who were the mo&s;t inveterate enemies of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> were forced from the evidence of his power to confe&s;s, <HI>that truly mighty works were done by him. Pontius Pi|late,</HI> by the in&s;cription of his cro&s;s, acknowledged him <HI>as King of the Jews,</HI> and as en&s;ign of the people. The evidence was &s;o &s;trong that it forced conviction upon our Lord's greate&s;t enemies.</P>
<P N="2">2. WE may &s;ee wherein the glory of the church con&s;i&s;ts; it con&s;i&s;ts in re&s;t and peace. Nothing is more glorious than to &s;ee <HI>brethren living together in unity.</HI> It is the true&s;t evidence of their relation to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and a bright mark of his image upon them. The glory of any thing in truth, con&s;i&s;ts in its goodne&s;s, and it is only &s;o far as it is good that any glory belongs unto it: But the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> has a&s;&s;ured us, <HI>That it is a good thing for brethren to live toge|ther in unity,</HI> P&s;al. cxxxiii. 1. All the pageantry of worldly grandeur, without love and peace, is an emblem of hell. And a profe&s;&s;ion of religion, without peace and unity, is only a religious way of
<PB N="74" REF="78">&s;erving the intere&s;t of Satan. The glory of the church con&s;i&s;ts of the true enjoyment of the fruits of the &s;pirit; of which peace is an eminent one. Whatever honour men of various oponions may take to them&s;elves, on account of the orthodoxy of their opinions, yet if they be fractious and de|vicive, and love not to enjoy re&s;t and peace, they have no glory worthy the name: <HI>For where there is envy, there is confu&s;ion and every evil work.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. SEE a rule to be ob&s;erved in order to enjoy the re&s;t here promi&s;ed. Make choice of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> for a leader in all your undertakings. <HI>He is the en&s;ign of his church,</HI> held forth in the go&s;pel as one who <HI>leads men to that everla&s;ting re&s;t that remains for the people of God.</HI> No wonder they peri&s;h from the way of re&s;t that keep not <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in their eye; for it is his office to lead men to everla&s;ting life. <HI>He is the way, the truth, and the life,</HI> and &s;uch as follow him &s;hall never be di&s;appointed. The great rea&s;on of &s;o many wandering out of the way of true re&s;t and peace, is that they know not nor follow <HI>Chri&s;t:</HI> They are ignorant of his character and offices, and have no dependance upon him; and by tru&s;ting to them&s;elves, they fall &s;hort of this glorious re&s;t. Not to make choice of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> for our leader, and to depend upon him, is unbelief; and no unbeliever can enjoy this re&s;t: The <HI>I&s;raelites could not enter in|to re&s;t becau&s;e of unbelief;</HI> and no unbeliever &s;hall ever be a partaker of this glorious <HI>re&s;t that remains for the children of God.</HI> It is &s;uch as follow <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> and re&s;t upon him by faith, that &s;hall behold him in that glorious place of re&s;t, where it may be &s;aid in the true&s;t manner, that it is <HI>glorious.</HI></P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> LET every one be exhorted to follow <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s &s;tandard as the true way to happine&s;s and everlading glory. This is no fruitle&s;s pur&s;uit, nor endle&s;s enquiry; they &s;hall enjoy re&s;t at la&s;t. The pre&s;ent &s;tate is a &s;tate of trial, but it leads to re&s;t and
<PB N="75" REF="79">peace to them that follow <HI>Je&s;us.

<HEAD>SERMON III. The Title of our Redeemer as the Lamb in the Mid&s;t of the Throne, and his Admini&s;tration of his Tru&s;t in that Capacity, opened up.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>REV. vii. 17.</HI></BIBL>
<P>For the Lamb which is in the Mid&s;t of the Throne &s;hall feed them.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> tells us that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is both the author and fini&s;her of our faith; and our text informs that all our &s;piritual nouri&s;hment here and hereafter, proceeds from him as the Saviour of his people. From the beginning of the fourth chapter to the end of the eleventh, the Lord repre&s;ents to <HI>John</HI> the &s;tate of the church under the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, by &s;undry &s;ignificant vi&s;ions and glorious figures; &s;uch as a throne in heaven and a lamb in the mid&s;t of it, <HI>four bea&s;ts, four-and-twenty elders, thunders, &s;even trumpets, and an innumerable company of ble&s;&s;ed wor|&s;hippers prai&s;ing to God and the Lamb for ever and ever.</HI> The &s;cene of this vi&s;ion is &s;aid to be in <HI>hea|ven,</HI> as in the beginning of the fourth chapter. Heaven in this book is &s;ometimes taken for the church, as chap. xii. 1, and 7. <HI>I &s;aw a wonder in hea|ven, and there was war in heaven:</HI> But here it mu&s;t be under&s;tood of the place where the ble&s;&s;ed re&s;ide, &s;uch as <HI>Stephen</HI> &s;aw at his death; or if we under|&s;tand it more complexly, as comprehending a re|pre&s;entation of both the militant and triumphant church, as &s;omething relative to both is repre&s;ented
<PB N="77" REF="81">in this vi&s;ion, it will be more con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;cope; for <HI>John</HI> &s;aw an innumerable company, be|&s;ides <HI>one hundred and forty-four thou&s;and,</HI> which &s;eem to denote the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> who could not as yet be in heaven, literally &s;o called.</P>
<P>IF we view heaven as comprehending both &s;tates of men, this vi&s;ion of <HI>John</HI>'s may con&s;i&s;t of a two-fold &s;cene; a repre&s;entation of the happy &s;tate of tho&s;e that were actually in glory, and of tho&s;e who &s;hould come there.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to our view of this &s;cene, the throne upon which the lamb is repre&s;ented as &s;itting, may be viewed as a throne of grace, or a throne of glory. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> our Lord, who&s;e death and dying love we are met this day to commemorate, is pointed out under the metaphor of a <HI>Lamb,</HI> in allu&s;ion to the pa&s;chal lamb of old, and upon a throne as having fini&s;hed the work that was given him to do; <HI>Ha|ving triumphed over principalities and powers.</HI> He is repre&s;ented as upon a throne, as the reward of ex|altation promi&s;ed unto him <HI>when he &s;hould make his &s;oul an offering for &s;in:</HI> This glory the church a|&s;cribes unto him, x$v. 6. <HI>Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: The &s;cepter of thy kingdom is a &s;cepter of righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> This throne of grace, which is &s;o in relation to us in this pre&s;ent &s;tate, is the throne of glory to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and the triumphant church; and our Lord upon this throne, &s;tands in relation to both. He is repre&s;ented as in the mid&s;t of the throne, pointing out his full authority to rule as king of <HI>Zion,</HI> and to &s;ave and redeem his people as the admini&s;trator of the new covenant.</P>
<P>THE manner of his admini&s;tration is pointed out by his title and the tru&s;t committed to him. His title is that of a Lamb, gentle and meek; his tru&s;t is to keep and feed his people; <HI>The Lamb that is in the mid&s;t of the throne &s;hall feed them.</HI></P>
<P>IN further di&s;cour&s;ing upon the &s;ubject, I pro|po&s;e,
<PB N="78" REF="82"><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> to explain our Mediator's title here given him. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Open up his admini&s;tration of his tru&s;t, as the nouri&s;her and feeder of his people. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Improve the &s;ubject.</P>
<P><HI>Head</HI> 1. To explain the title here given to our Lord and Saviour, namely of a <HI>Lamb.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. IT points out the &s;potle&s;s purity and inno|cence of his nature. <HI>He had no &s;in, nor was guile found in his mouth:</HI> So the Apo&s;tle tells us, Heb. vii. 2. <HI>Such on High-prie&s;t became us, as was holy, harmle&s;s, undefiled, and &s;eparate from &s;inners.</HI> It was nece&s;&s;ary our Redeemer &s;hould be free from all &s;in, like a lamb without blemi&s;h or &s;pot, that his obla|tion might be acceptable unto God; for had their been any defect in his nature, or any &s;in cleaving unto him, he would have been an unfit and im|proper &s;acrifice, and needed an atonement for him|&s;elf. But as the pa&s;chal lamb, which was a type of him, was without blemi&s;h; &s;o he, as the glo|rious &s;ub&s;tance and &s;ignification of that type, was pure and free from all manner of &s;in.</P>
<P>HE had no original &s;in, being &s;anctified by the Holy Gho&s;t, and born of a virgin in an extraordi|nary manner: Nor had he any actual guilt by fal&s;e imitation of wicked men; for he lived &s;eparate from &s;inners: His nature was pure, his manner of life &s;trict and exemplary.</P>
<P>As he was po&s;itively innocent, &s;o was he pa&s;&s;ively al&s;o. There was a po&s;itive natural holine&s;s and purity in his &s;oul and body: Every good qualification reign|ed in perfection in his holy nature. Love to friends and enemies, a readine&s;s on all occa&s;ions to do good to all men, were inherent in his nature. Love to God and every commandment of his holy law, needed not in him to be &s;tirred up by motives, but were radically in his very con&s;titution. It was as his meat and drink to do the will of his heavenly Fa|ther.
<PB N="79" REF="83">His body was free of all po&s;itive &s;eeds of corruption; &s;o that when he was laid in the grave, the infection of corrupt nature did not &s;eize his holy and ble&s;&s;ed body: Being free of &s;in he was al&s;o free of the &s;eeds of mortality. It was becau&s;e it was nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould die, and not becau&s;e it was natural to him that he yielded to death, and was laid in a grave. It is both natural and nece&s;|&s;ary to men to die, becau&s;e they have the &s;eeds of mortality in their very con&s;titution; and never can be freed from &s;in till they be freed from it by death. But it was not &s;o with the Lamb of God, for he was innocent and &s;potle&s;s like a <HI>Lamb without all &s;in. Je&s;us</HI> was al&s;o pa&s;&s;ively pure and innocent; <HI>He gave no offence to the Jews nor the Greeks. When he was reviled, he reviled not again, but commended him&s;elf to him that judgeth righteou&s;ly.</HI> Like a lamb, that can|not hurt any thing, he behaved him&s;elf towards all men, both friends and enemies. When he had no call to exert his power to do good to any, he never u&s;ed it to any man's hurt: He never &s;pake nor acted to the di&s;advantage of any. Being pure and holy by nature, his whole life was a te&s;timony of immaculate innocence and untainted rectitude: From his birth to his grave there were no inordi|nate affections in his holy &s;oul, nor evil actions in his hands: Even when he was highly injured, and mo&s;t cruelly and unju&s;tly u&s;ed, <HI>As a &s;heep before his &s;hearers is dumb, &s;o he opened not his mouth.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. THIS title contains in it his fitne&s;s for that tru&s;t that was committed unto him. He had re|ceived the weighty and important tru&s;t of men's &s;alvation: The Father gave him a &s;eed to redeem, and he accepted of them; he engaged to pay the price of their redemption, which was to give him|&s;elf a ran&s;om for them; and as he became their High-prie&s;t, <HI>He behoved to have &s;omewhat to offer.</HI> An imperfect or impure offering could not be ac|cepted
<PB N="80" REF="84">of by a holy and perfect God, who&s;e nature is holine&s;s, and his law perfection: But <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> being holy, pure and perfect in the whole properties of his nature, was a fit and proper propitiation for the &s;ins of his people: This the apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> witne&s;|&s;eth, 1 Pet. i. 18. <HI>Fora&s;much as ye are not redeemed with corruptible things, &s;uch as &s;ilver and gold; but with the precious blood of Chri&s;t, as of a Lamb with|out &s;pot.</HI></P>
<P>OUR Lord being free of every imperfection, was exceedingly fit for honouring the holy command|ment: He had both inclination and power to fulfil it. His holy will and inclination was natu|rally bent towards all the precepts of the righteous law, and being free of all prejudices oppo&s;ite there|to, had full ability to fulfil all its commandments. His purity and holine&s;s made him likewi&s;e a fit &s;acrifice to &s;atisfy divine ju&s;tice; <HI>For he was a Lamb without blemi&s;h.</HI> The &s;tricte&s;t ju&s;tice could find no imperfection in his obedience, nor in&s;ufficiency in his &s;atisfaction. Concerning his perfect righteou&s;|ne&s;s, <HI>Jehovah</HI> &s;ays, <HI>I am well plea&s;ed for his righte|ou&s;ne&s;s &s;ake,</HI> I&s;ai. xlii. 21.</P>
<P>HE every way an&s;wers this fair and innocent character given him of a Lamb. As the Lamb of God he was an appointed and con&s;ecrated &s;acrifice. The pa&s;chal lamb of old was &s;et apart for a &s;acri|fice by the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> and for this purpo&s;e was kept from the tenth day of the month till the fourteenth; but had not there been a divine appointment, it would not have been accepted of: The law war|ranting the in&s;titution was the &s;afety of the people's conduct, and made the offering acceptable. Our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> was under an appointment of the Father, and con&s;ecrated by the Holy Spirit to be a &s;acrifice <HI>for the &s;ins of his people.</HI> He was an ob|lation by heaven's unchangeable law, and without an appointment he could not have been a propiati|on
<PB N="81" REF="85">on without pre&s;umption. An&s;werable to his type the pa&s;chal lamb, he fulfilled his appointment; he &s;uffered, <HI>that all things written in Mo&s;es and the pro|phets concerning him might be fulfilled.</HI> The pa&s;chal lamb was not only a &s;acrifice but a fea&s;t; &s;o our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> is both a fea&s;t and a &s;acrifice: His death was a &s;acrifice that &s;atisfied ju&s;tice, and it is al&s;o the food of the believer's faith. A believ|ing view of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> as the &s;lain Lamb of God, is as real food to the &s;oul of a true chri&s;tian, as any cor|poreal food is to his body: It &s;trengthens our faith and credit in God, as reconciled to us, enlivens our affections and encrea&s;es our love. Our faith in God, as propitious to us through the blood of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> will rai&s;e our affections towards him who paid the ran&s;om for our &s;ins, and brought about our recon|ciliation: It will kindle our love to him that loved us, and gave his only begotten &s;on to die for us.</P>
<P N="3">3. THIS title in&s;tructs us in the unchangeable nature of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s prie&s;thood. He is &s;till in heaven, as to character what he was while here, and bears the &s;ame offices for our &s;alvation. Though he hath changed his &s;tate, he &s;till retains the &s;ame office; he who was the &s;uffering Saviour, <HI>or the Lamb for a burnt-offering, is the Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne. This man continueth for ever, and hath an unchangeable prie&s;thood,</HI> Heb. vii. 24. What he once offered in &s;acrifice for our &s;ins, he now pre|&s;ents in heaven for our ju&s;tification. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> hath laid a&s;ide none of his offices, as our Mediator in heaven: <HI>He is the Light of the heavenly city, a Prie&s;t upon his throne for ever, of his kingdom there is no end: His dominion is an everla&s;ting dominion.</HI> Though the pa&s;chal lamb was &s;lain, its blood &s;pake; and it was a con&s;tant &s;ecurity again&s;t the &s;in it was offered for, that it &s;hould not bring the people into con|demnation, Though <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was but once &s;lain, his
<PB N="82" REF="86">blood &s;till &s;peaks peace to his people, and he pre|&s;ents the merits of his oblation before the throne of God, Heb. xii. 24. <HI>And ye are come to the blood of &s;prinkling, that &s;peaks better things than that of Abel.</HI></P>
<P>THOUGH <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> be in heaven, his blood &s;peaks peace to men upon earth. He is &s;till <HI>a faithful High Prie&s;t, in things pertaining to God, and makes reconciliation for the &s;ins of his people.</HI> He is in the mid&s;t of the throne, as our advocate and interce&s;|&s;or, and ever liveth for that purpo&s;e, Heb. vii. 25. <HI>He is able to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t all that come unto God by him, &s;eeing he ever liveth to make reconciliation for us.</HI> It is nece&s;&s;ary that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hould continue in this character, that his people might have &s;trong con&s;olation. <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as our interce&s;&s;or, hath fixt the anchor of our hope within the vail in him&s;elf, as the apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;eth it, Heb. vi. 18. <HI>That we might have &s;trong con&s;olation, who have fled for refuge to the hope that is &s;et before us.</HI> The title that our Redeemer received in the new covenant tran&s;action for our reconciliation, he &s;till and ever will retain for our per&s;everance and everla&s;ting confirmation The&s;e few things are implied in this title given our ble&s;|&s;ed Redeemer as the Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne.</P>
<P><HI>Head</HI> 2. To open our Redeemer's admini&s;tration of his tru&s;t, expre&s;t in the words, <HI>the Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne &s;hall feed them.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. LET it be ob&s;erved that this is expre&s;t in a figure, and is to be under&s;tood by analogy to our daily nouri&s;hment by the providence of God, as in him we live, move, and have our being. As our bodily frame is upheld and maintained by God, as the author of our providence, &s;o our &s;piritual is maintained by him as our Lord and Saviour. The feeding of the &s;aints, here or hereafter, proceeds from <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as the admini&s;trator of the covenant
<PB N="83" REF="87">of grace. As our bodies are &s;upported by his bounty, &s;o our &s;ouls are maintained by his grace and favour. What food is to the body, commu|nion with <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> in all his offices and relations, is to our &s;ouls; and a &s;aint can no more live without this communion, than any creature can live without food or nouri&s;hment, P&s;al. lxxiii. 25. The &s;piritual ca|pacity of the intellectual frame may be &s;aid to be fed, when &s;uch objects are pre&s;ented to its contem|plation as &s;uit its nature, fill up its capacity, and &s;atisfy its de&s;ires. Here it may be nece&s;&s;ary to con|&s;ider what things <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in his divine admini&s;tration be&s;tows upon his people for nouri&s;hment to their &s;ouls.</P>
<P N="1">1. HE repre&s;ents to their faith his love, as the &s;urety of the new covenant, engaging for them as their &s;urety prie&s;t, to fulfil all righteou&s;ne&s;s for them in the fulne&s;s of time; as Prov. viii. 23. <HI>I was &s;et up from everla&s;ting, from the beginning or ever the the earth was.</HI> A view of our Saviour's love as &s;urety of the covenant, engaging for believers, when yet they were conceived as enemies to God, and obnoxious to his wrath and cur&s;e, mu&s;t certainly be an entertaining &s;ubject to every heaven-born &s;oul. When <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> by his Spirit reveals this in the doc|trines and promi&s;es of the go&s;pel to the &s;oul, it is like good news from a far country; then with the apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> the believer can &s;ay, <HI>He loved me, and gave him&s;elf for me,</HI> Gal. ii. 20. This is nouri&s;h|ment to faith, when the &s;oul is ready to faint un|der apprehen&s;ions of divine anger. A view of <HI>Je&s;us, as the lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne,</HI> &s;u&s;tain|ing the character of a &s;urety for his people, and for &s;uch a &s;oul in particular, will &s;atisfy the &s;piritual di&s;po&s;ition, <HI>as with marrow and fatne&s;s:</HI> Then can a chri&s;tian &s;ay with the P&s;almi&s;t, P&s;al. lxiii. 5. <HI>My
<PB N="84" REF="88">&s;oul &s;hall be filled as with marrow and fatne&s;s, and my mouth &s;hall prai&s;e thee with joyful lips.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN unbelief and the deceit of the evil one, darken the &s;piritual views of the true chri&s;tian, marr his comfort, and introduce doubts and fears into the mind, make him que&s;tion his right to the divine favour, the Redeemer pre&s;ents to his &s;oul what he is to him as his &s;urety and &s;alvation, and &s;ays, <HI>Let all thy wants be upon me.</HI> This is one of the fir&s;t comforts <HI>the Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne</HI> gives his people. The fir&s;t &s;olid &s;atisfaction that the chri&s;tian enjoys, after his embracing of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> ari&s;es from a ju&s;t view of him, as <HI>the high prie&s;t over the hou&s;e of God.</HI> This gives him a &s;ight of the pardon of &s;in, as his guilt is transferred upon his &s;urety, and &s;peaks a favourable relea&s;e to the &s;oul; <HI>If ye &s;eek me, let the&s;e go their way:</HI> And as he is for ever appointed unto this office, the &s;oul has here a la&s;ting &s;pring of comfort. Until the &s;oul by faith in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;ees its intere&s;t in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as the &s;urety of the covenant, it never can be truly &s;atisfied, nor rationally delighted.</P>
<P>THE &s;ure and rational views of <HI>Je&s;us;</HI> as a &s;ure|ty prie&s;t, bearing the &s;ins of his people; and as their interce&s;&s;or, agenting their cau&s;e before God, is true and &s;uitable nouri&s;hment to a believer. It &s;trengthens faith, encrea&s;es love, and rai&s;es a true joy in the &s;oul.</P>
<P>CHRIST al&s;o repre&s;ents unto his people the cau&s;e and end of his prie&s;thood and &s;urety&s;hip: His free and unmerited love is that glorious cau&s;e there|of, a mo&s;t powerful and active one. This love is not merely an inclination towards their welfare and happine&s;s; but a powerful determining principle, whereby he is influenced to do them good. The right under&s;tanding of this encrea&s;es the love of men to <HI>Je&s;us;</HI> for as this love in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> appears to them as an everla&s;ting powerful propen&s;ity to &s;ave
<PB N="85" REF="89">and &s;anctify them, they &s;ee a perpetual rea&s;on found|ed in gratitude to love him. Their &s;alvation, and liberty from &s;in and death, is the noble and excel|lent end of our Redeemer's &s;urety&s;hip. He &s;ub|&s;titutes him&s;elf as our &s;urety, that we might be freed from condemnation, and be <HI>a holy peculiar people to him, zealous of good works.</HI> All the&s;e re|lations of his as a &s;urety of the new covenant, are delightful to contemplate, and are &s;piritual nouri&s;h|ment to the &s;ouls of chri&s;tians. When he di&s;covers the&s;e to his &s;aints, he may be &s;aid to feed them.</P>
<P N="2">2. HE feeds them with a di&s;covery of the won|derful con&s;titution of his per&s;on, as God and Man, in two di&s;tinct natures, in one per&s;on. He opens up to his children the ble&s;&s;ed relation he &s;tands in to them, <HI>as bone of their bone, and fle&s;h of their fle&s;h,</HI> as their near kin&s;man that hath performed the kin&s;|man's part. This di&s;covery is to the chri&s;tian a ve|ry delightful manife&s;tation, whereby he is ready to declare his &s;atisfaction in the Divine goodne&s;s, and to &s;ay, <HI>it is good for him to be here.</HI> To behold the nature of man united to the divine per&s;on of the Son, and exalted to a &s;tate of inconceivable bli&s;s; and withal, to have the certainty that this is a pledge of our participation of the &s;ame glory in due time, cannot mi&s;s to be a &s;atisfying di&s;covery. This <HI>the Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne</HI> opens up, and manife&s;ts to his people, his beloved ones: Whereby they anticipate, even in this life, fore|ta&s;tes of the &s;weet enjoyment of the marriage &s;up|per of the Lamb. It was &s;uch a di&s;covery as this that made Job &s;ay, <HI>I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he &s;hall &s;tand at the latter day upon the earth; and though after my &s;kin the worms &s;hall de&s;troy this body; yet in my fle&s;h &s;hall I &s;ee God: Whom I &s;hall &s;ee for my&s;elf, and not another.</HI> A view of human na|ture, united to the &s;on of God, for all the ends and purpo&s;es of &s;alvation, not in a mere pa&s;&s;ive &s;en&s;e,
<PB N="86" REF="90">as a redeemer from wrath; but as one that exalts the chri&s;tian to the highe&s;t degree of felicity in the favour of God, mu&s;t highly rejoice the &s;ouls of be|lievers. When our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> manife&s;ts him&s;elf in his character, as Emmanuel, God with us, to his people, there is &s;omething &s;o engaging in the di&s;covery, that it fills up the whole attention of the mind, and &s;atisfies all the de&s;ires of the &s;oul. This di&s;covery affords a great deal more contemplation than a finite capacity is capable of receiving or containing. Who can wholly comprehend this glorious my&s;tery? This <HI>the angels de&s;ire to look into</HI> with plea&s;ure: It is like food to their de&s;ires, but much more &s;o to tho&s;e &s;ouls who are admitted to view it and &s;ee their intere&s;t in it.</P>
<P>THE Saviour of &s;inners, as <HI>the Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne,</HI> graciou&s;ly admits his people into a view of the my&s;tery of Godline&s;s; this &s;o delights their &s;ouls, and fills their &s;piritual capacity, that with <HI>Paul,</HI> 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> iii. 16. they cry out, <HI>Great is the my&s;tery of godline&s;s, God manife&s;ted in the fle&s;h.</HI> There is &s;omething in this &s;ubject &s;o entertaining, and &s;atisfying to a rational being, given to &s;piritual contemplation, that of all others it begets the full|e&s;t &s;atisfaction in the &s;oul. The glory of the Di|vine mercy and goodne&s;s &s;hines &s;o illu&s;triou&s;ly here, that a being, &s;en&s;ible of its own guilt and imper|fection, cannot but be delighted with the pro&s;pect. A relation of blood and kindred with the be&s;t of Beings; to be related to the God of heaven, in a nearne&s;s of fle&s;h and blood, and have a right to &s;ay Emmanuel is our near kin&s;man, is a joyful con&s;i|deration.</P>
<P N="3">3. HE opens up the &s;ufficiency and fitne&s;s of his death, to procure his people freedom from wrath, and their admi&s;&s;ion into the Divine favour. This affords a joyful entertainment to the &s;ouls of his &s;aints, as it is a &s;alvation from the greate&s;t of evils,
<PB N="87" REF="91">and the enjoyment of the greate&s;t good. What can be wor&s;e than the di&s;plea&s;ure of the Almighty: And what more delightful than his favour and ap|probation? The apo&s;tle &s;peaks in a feeling manner upon this &s;ubject: <HI>Who &s;hall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect; it is God that ju&s;tifies, who is he that condemneth? It is Chri&s;t that died:&mdash;When we were &s;inners Chri&s;t died for the ungodly:&mdash;We have peace with God through our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> Our Lord and Saviour as the admini&s;trator of the new covenant, when he manife&s;ts to the chri&s;tian what the value and the end of his death is, as to him; and &s;hews by the Holy Spirit his &s;pecial intere&s;t therein; he enables him thereby to conclude, <HI>that he &s;hall not die, but live, and di&s;cover the works of the Lord,</HI> P&s;al. cxviii. 17. This is like food and nouri&s;hment to his &s;oul, by which he is enabled to run his chri&s;tian race with joy. The mo&s;t refined entertainment ne|ver &s;o much &s;atisfied the delicate&s;t ta&s;te, as &s;uch a view of the death of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> &s;atisfies the &s;oul of a true believer. A believing di&s;covery of the death of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as the cau&s;e of deliverance from &s;piritual and eternal death, is like a &s;weet and refre&s;hing cordial to a fainting &s;oul; a view of it as the cau&s;e of our admi&s;&s;ion into the favour of God, is like a plenteous fea&s;t to a &s;trong and craving appetite.</P>
<P>THE blood of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> pre&s;ented unto the faith of a true believer; or, which is the &s;ame thing, to a true per&s;ua&s;ion of the &s;ufficiency of his death, and its fitne&s;s for all the ends and purpo&s;es of &s;alvation, is like a &s;eal whereby the cleare&s;t right to an inhe|ritance is impre&s;&s;ed; which has a native tendency to rejoice the mind, and give &s;atisfaction to tho&s;e who have it. <HI>The Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne,</HI> affords a lively di&s;play of him&s;elf, as &s;lain and wounded for his people's tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. Such a di&s;play made the church by the prophet &s;ay, I&s;a. lv. 5. <HI>He was wounded for our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, he was
<PB N="88" REF="92">brui&s;ed for our iniquities, the cha&s;ti&s;ement of our peace was upon him, and by his &s;tripes we are healed.</HI> The &s;ufficiency and the fitne&s;s of the death of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> for &s;alvation, is like a fund of goodne&s;s laid up in &s;tore; for it is a &s;ufficient price for all future &s;piritual en|joyments; the whole of our future bli&s;s and hap|pine&s;s, is only the reward of this great work; and <HI>the Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne,</HI> will thro' all e|ternity feed his people with a view of the connection between his death, and that happine&s;s they enjoy. The &s;ong of the redeemed from among men, is founded upon the death of <HI>Je&s;us:&mdash;Thou wa&s;t &s;lain, and ha&s;t redeemed us to God by thy blood.</HI></P>
<P>THE death and &s;ufferings of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is &s;o &s;atisfy|ing to tho&s;e who under&s;tand it aright, that it be|gets joy in the mind at every remembrance. It is a continued &s;ource of plea&s;ure and delight, to all who &s;ee their intere&s;t in it: It was the &s;ubject of the apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI>'s boa&s;ting and glorying, <HI>God for|bid,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>that I &s;hould glory &s;ave in the cro&s;s of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whereby the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.</HI> A literal view of the death of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as an article of hi&s;tory, without con&s;idering it with a &s;pecial view to our&s;elves, by faith of the operation of God, will afford no true &s;atisfaction to our &s;ouls. <HI>Je&s;us</HI> our Saviour, by the powe$ of his Holy Spirit, brings his death near to the &s;ouls of his people, and pre&s;ents it in the Divine te&s;timony as an object of true and &s;piritual contem|plation. This is what he pre&s;ents you with this day in the &s;acrament of the &s;upper; herein his death is &s;hewed forth to all worthy receivers, and by faith it will become &s;piritual nouri&s;hment to your &s;ouls, and tend to your growth in grace, and advancement in holine&s;s. <HI>Je&s;us</HI> tells his di&s;ciples, that <HI>his fle&s;h is meat indeed, and his blood is drink indeed:</HI> That tho&s;e who received it in a &s;piritual manner, <HI>&s;hould not die, but &s;hould live for ever.</HI> A view of the
<PB N="89" REF="93">&s;ufficiency and fitne&s;s of the death of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> mu&s;t in con&s;equence of all this be very &s;atisfying to the &s;ouls of true chri&s;tians, and a confirmation of the truth of the text, <HI>That the Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne, &s;till feeds his people in the mid&s;t of their enemies here below.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. CHRIST feeds his people with the refre&s;hing influences of his grace: <HI>He leads them be&s;ide the &s;till Waters,</HI> P&s;al. xxiii. 2. Hereby they are enabled to improve all the former in&s;tances of his goodne&s;s; <HI>he &s;atisfies them with his abundant grace. The Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne leads them to living fountains of waters.</HI> This was the rea&s;on why <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was anointed with the <HI>Holy Spirit above mea&s;ure,</HI> that he might &s;upply his people with grace in the time of their need. The &s;aints in the day of conver&s;ion, receive the Spirit as the Spirit of quickening, by which they are <HI>made alive in Chri&s;t Je&s;us:</HI> But <HI>the Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne, leads them</HI> deeper into the river of con&s;olation. He gives new com|munications of his grace to bring them forward unto perfection. The fir&s;t principles of grace with|out merit from <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as the head of influences, would decay; but as believers and He are united, he &s;ends them new &s;upplies of his goodne&s;s. He makes the river of life run continually into their &s;ouls, and refre&s;hes their decaying &s;pirits with the waters of divine con&s;olation.</P>
<P>THEY have acce&s;s unto the fountain of all goodne&s;s through him: Through him, &s;ays the apo&s;tle, <HI>we have acce&s;s by one &s;pirit unto the father.</HI> This is the cau&s;e of the continuation of their &s;piri|tual life: The Spirit liveth and abideth in them. Were they to depend upon their own good endea|vours for &s;upply, their nouri&s;hment would &s;oon come to an end, as the cau&s;e is both finite and im|perfect; but their &s;piritual nouri&s;hment comes from above, from him who hath <HI>received gifts for men,
<PB N="90" REF="94">that God the Lord might dwell among them,</HI> P&s;al. lxviii. 18. As the glorious admini&s;trator of the covenant of grace, he be&s;tows upon his church the&s;e gifts he hath received in tru&s;t, according to the va|rious needs of the members thereof. When a live|ly frame and exerci&s;e is ready to decay, and die away, he &s;ends his quickening Spirit and revives his Zion, <HI>&s;ends his word and heals her,</HI> P&s;al. cvii. 20. In all ca&s;es, and at all times, he is <HI>the Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne,</HI> and will <HI>feed them.</HI></P>
<P>THE la&s;t thing in the method was to make &s;ome improvement of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P N="1">1. HENCE &s;ee what believers may expect at a communion table. Seeing <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is the ma&s;ter of the fea&s;t, the entertainment will be according to the &s;tate of the king. <HI>He is the Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne that is to feed you,</HI> O believing friend of <HI>Chri&s;t!</HI> He is ve&s;ted with full power, and furni&s;hed with all fitne&s;s and &s;ufficiency. He is Lord of his own hou&s;e, <HI>and fills all in all;</HI> the whole that can make you happy through eternity is in his hand: <HI>In him doth all fullne&s;s dwell:</HI> The trea&s;ures of wi&s;dom and knowledge are in him. You can conceive no bli&s;s nor happine&s;s &s;uitable for your &s;ouls, but it is in him; for he is infinite, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth all things, and hath promi&s;ed to give them to you, according to your needs and wants. If you are his, <HI>all things are yours, whether Paul or Apolo, or life, or death, all things are yours, and ye are Chri&s;t's, and Chri&s;t is God's.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. LEARN what is your duty in view of an ap|proach unto God in this &s;olemn ordinance: It is to come empty of your&s;elves, <HI>the Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne mu&s;t feed you.</HI> Think not to feed up|on your experiences, your good endeavours, or for|mer attainments: The&s;e are a deadly poi&s;on when &s;ub&s;tituted in the place of future dependance upon <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> What you expect at the table of the Lord,
<PB N="91" REF="95">mu&s;t not be your own, but <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s: The Lamb mu&s;t feed you and provide for you. All is of his own preparing, every thing is a free gift: This <HI>David</HI> witne&s;&s;eth, P&s;al. xxiii. 5. <HI>Thou ha&s;t prepared a table before me, in the pre&s;ence of mine enemies.</HI> Think not that you can have any thing to recommend you to God which <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> hath not given you. His righ|teou&s;ne&s;s is the wedding garment, which only can make you approach acceptably to his table, and it is his own gift: The chri&s;tian pa&s;&s;over is wholly of his preparing.</P>
<P N="3">3. SEE what this communion is which you en|joy in the &s;acrament of the &s;upper. It is the &s;ame in nature and kind with what the &s;aints in heaven enjoy. <HI>The Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne</HI> is the &s;ubject and author of both. The &s;aints in heaven are fed with the &s;ame &s;piritual food: They are indeed of a larger capacity than you are in this imperfect &s;tate, and are capable of enjoying more of the Divine fulne&s;s than you are yet capable of; but they enjoy nothing of a different nature from what you enjoy. They can &s;ee farther into <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s &s;urety&s;hip, the glorious con&s;titution of his per&s;on as God in our nature, his death as our redeemer, the fulne&s;s of his grace, and the glory of his exal|tation, than ye can yet do; but you feed upon the &s;ame food with the re&s;t of his children: <HI>The Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne</HI> feeds both the church mili|tant and triumphant.</P>
<P N="4">4. WE may &s;ee a difference between &s;aints and &s;inners, in point of &s;atisfaction to their &s;ouls. The one feeds upon the fle&s;h and blood of the Son of God; <HI>the Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne feeds them:</HI> The other feeds upon the &s;inful plea&s;ures of a pre&s;ent world. They <HI>feed upon hu&s;ks,</HI> in compari|&s;on of what the true chri&s;tian is &s;atisfied with. There is no real &s;atisfaction in the empty plea&s;ures that &s;inners are &s;atisfied with; there is more of no|thing
<PB N="92" REF="96">than reality in them, when applied to the &s;oul; yea they are wor&s;e than nothing, for they are hurtful. The nouri&s;hment of the believer's &s;oul is &s;ub&s;tantial, permanent and la&s;ting. The food of the chri&s;tian's &s;oul is like its &s;elf, &s;piritual and im|mortal; la&s;ting as the nature of the &s;oul.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> WE may &s;ee the love of God in <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us</HI> in preparing his chri&s;tian pa&s;&s;over; <HI>God &s;o loved our world as to &s;end his &s;on to die for our &s;ins, that through him we might have everla&s;ting life:</HI> He gave him&s;elf to the death that we might live thro' him. Behold the love of God in giving up his Son unto a &s;hameful and ignominious death for men that were his enemies, that they might have life and nouri&s;hment to their &s;ouls! Behold the love of the Son of God in cheerfully &s;uffering the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite torments that we might have food to our &s;ouls! Truly we may &s;ay with the Apo&s;tle; <HI>Behold what manner of love the father hath be&s;towed upon us that we &s;hould be called the &s;ons of God!</HI> This ordinance of the &s;upper is a memorial of love; of the dying love of our dear Redeemer, and ought to be ob&s;erved with the highe&s;t love and regard to him. If he cheerfully died that we might live for evermore, we ought with all our hearts and &s;ouls <HI>to love him who loved us, and gave him&s;elf for us;</HI> for it is only &s;uch as love <HI>Je&s;us</HI> who will under&s;tand the meaning of the text, <HI>the Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne &s;hall feed them.</HI></P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the fir&s;t di&s;cour&s;e upon this &s;ubject we have taken a view of the admini&s;tration of our Lord
<PB N="93" REF="97"><HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> towards his church, and &s;hewn how far he an&s;wers his title, <HI>as the Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne, in feeding his church and people,</HI> or giving &s;uch di&s;coveries unto them as an&s;wer the &s;ame purpo&s;e to the &s;oul as food does to the body.</P>
<P>IT may next be nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider what is meant by <HI>His leading them to living fountains of waters.</HI> Here our Lord's admini&s;tration may be taken up in a twofold view: Fir&s;t, with re&s;pect to the militant members of his church: And in the &s;econd place, with re&s;pect to tho&s;e in the church triumphant.</P>
<P>HIS conduct towards his people, in their mili|tant &s;tate, &s;hall be fir&s;t con&s;idered: And in order to the right under&s;tanding of what may be &s;aid upon this branch of our Lord's admini&s;tration, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve a few things, to open the way for what may be &s;aid.</P>
<P N="1">1. IT may be ob&s;erved that the Almighty, in divine revelation, has expre&s;t his mind anent divine things in &s;uch a manner as is &s;uited to our imperfect &s;tate and capacity. <HI>Leading,</HI> and <HI>fountains of waters,</HI> are terms that the meane&s;t capacity can under&s;tand, and point out that there is &s;ome analogy between the conduct of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> the true &s;hepherd, and &s;hep|herds among men: <HI>For he leads his people like a flock of &s;heep,</HI> and refre&s;hes them with divine con|&s;olation, as with pure water. There will be no occa&s;ion to change &s;cripture expre&s;&s;ions for fear of men fixing wrong ideas or notions unto them, &s;ince there are but few who literally believe and under&s;tand &s;imilies. When <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is &s;aid to <HI>lead his people into living fountains of waters,</HI> few but the prophane will fix a literal meaning to the words. It is true indeed, that a philo&s;opher, or a modern go&s;peler, would endeavour to avoid the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, and &s;hun the phra&s;e, <HI>Leading to living fountains of waters,</HI> as he would do fire, through the whole of
<PB N="94" REF="98">his di&s;cour&s;e: But whoever endeavours to &s;ub&s;titute modern diction in religious di&s;cour&s;es, e&s;pecially in &s;ermons, in the room of &s;cripture phra&s;es, will &s;tand a fair chance to be le&s;s under&s;tood. They may in|deed plea&s;e the vain and giddy, and be popular, be|cau&s;e new; and for this very rea&s;on they plea&s;e Sa|tan too, who hates the plain manner of teaching u&s;ed in &s;cripture.</P>
<P>THE &s;criptures them&s;elves are <HI>the &s;word of the &s;pirit,</HI> and are mo&s;t hurtful to the kingdom of Sa|tan when u&s;ed in their native &s;implicity; but when once their doctrines are blunted with men's inven|tions, like the edge of a &s;word laid by, they will do little execution.</P>
<P>A MODERN teacher would perhaps &s;ay from the&s;e words, <Q>That <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> the be&s;t of teachers, has &startq;taught us a perfect &s;y&s;tem of morals, and left us a pure example; and when we imitate him by ob&s;erving the&s;e rules he hath left us, we advance &endq;forward in goodne&s;s and virtue.</Q></P>
<P>BUT there is as much and more under&s;tood by &s;ay|ing, <HI>that he leads his people to living fountains of wa|ters,</HI> and as ea&s;ily comprehended by &s;uch as read the &s;criptures. Such as are only acquainted with plays and romances, will not indeed under&s;tand the figures of &s;cripture, nor the meaning of the &s;imilies there made u&s;e of; but tho&s;e who read the Bible will, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, under&s;tand them. There is a differ|ence between under&s;tanding &s;imilies literally, and departing from them; nor do we find the mo&s;t ig|norant among ordinary readers of &s;cripture, in great danger of believing them &s;o. The Almighty cer|tainly knew what was the be&s;t method to convey divine truths to the &s;ouls of men, and has given us palpable examples in divine revelation.</P>
<P N="2">2. I OBSERVE, that this phra&s;e in the text is a figure taken from the ca&s;e and cu&s;tom of travel|lers in the ea&s;tern warm climates, (and &s;eems to be
<PB N="95" REF="99">a Hebrewi&s;m) where guides were made u&s;e of to direct travellers in their way, and point out unto them the &s;prings and fountains of water that were needful to refre&s;h them in their journey. It teach|eth us how dependent we are upon our Redeemer, both in this life and that which is to come, for our comfort and true happine&s;s: And that it is upon his powerful grace we mu&s;t depend for all we need and expect through eternity. As the pilgrim upon his journey depended upon his guide, &s;o mu&s;t chri&s;tians depend upon <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> and as they were directed by their leaders to the fountains and &s;prings of water, by which they were refre&s;hed, and enabled to pur&s;ue their jour|ney, &s;o every true believer &s;hall be directed by <HI>Je&s;us</HI> to the promi&s;es and means of &s;alvation, nece&s;&s;ary to comfort their &s;ouls in their &s;tate of pilgrimage here below. From &s;uch a figure of &s;peech or &s;imile, we can as ea&s;ily under&s;tand the nature of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s ad|mini&s;tration, as the leader of his people, as we can learn the meaning of any thing we never &s;aw, by demon&s;tration or de&s;cription. For unle&s;s it is af|firmed, that there is no analogy between our Lord's admini&s;tration, and that of a guide to a traveller; and between refre&s;hing fountains, and the means of grace, the in&s;truction from the &s;imile will hold good.</P>
<P>THE teaching by &s;imilies has been practi&s;ed by the wi&s;e&s;t of men: <HI>Solomon</HI> in his book of <HI>Proverbs,</HI> very often ob&s;erves this method of teaching. It is not indeed u&s;ed in argument; for the de&s;ign of a &s;imile is not to prove what is doubtful, but to clear what is dark. <HI>Solomon,</HI> very &s;ucce&s;sfully ob|&s;erves this method, Prov. xxvi. 1. <HI>As &s;now in &s;um|mer, and rain in harve&s;t; &s;o honour is not &s;eemly for a fool.</HI> Ver. 14. <HI>As the door turneth upon its hinges, &s;o</HI> doth <HI>the &s;lothful upon his bed.</HI> Chap. xxviii. 15. <HI>As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear;</HI> &s;o is <HI>a wicked ruler over the poor people.</HI> Our Saviour, in his para|bles,
<PB N="96" REF="100">practi&s;ed this method often, and the prophets give many in&s;tances of this manner of in&s;truction; as in <HI>I&s;a.</HI> v. 1. where the church is compared unto a vineyard. Many of the be&s;t heathen writers, both poets and others, abound with this kind of metaphor.

<P N="3">3. THAT it is a character very often given to our mediator in &s;cripture, which the apo&s;tle gives him here, viz. <HI>a Leader,</HI> as in <HI>I&s;a.</HI> lv. 4. <HI>Behold I have given him for a witne&s;s to the people, a leader and commander to the people.</HI> Chap. xlviii. 17. <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord thy redeemer, the holy one of I&s;rael, I am the Lord thy God which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by the way that thou &s;hould&s;t go.</HI> P&s;al. xxiii. 2. <HI>He leadeth me be&s;ide the &s;till waters.</HI> John x. 3. <HI>To him the porter openeth; and the &s;heep hear his voice; and he calleth his own &s;heep by name, and leadeth them out.</HI> He is &s;aid <HI>to lead Jo&s;eph like a flock, and to bring or lead his people to the borders of his &s;anctuary.</HI> From all this it is plain, that &s;uch who read the &s;criptures cannot be ignorant of this character of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> our &s;aviour.

<P N="4">4. I OBSERVE, that the gifts and graces of the Holy Spirit, and the ordinances of grace, are very often in divine revelation compared unto <HI>waters, wells,</HI> and <HI>fountains of water.</HI> In <HI>P&s;al.</HI> xxiii. the ble&s;&s;ings of the Holy Spirit are compared to <HI>&s;till waters: Thou leade&s;t me be&s;ide the &s;till waters.</HI> To a <HI>river,</HI> Ezek. xlvii. 5. <HI>And it was a river I could not pa&s;s over: For the waters were ri&s;en, waters to &s;wim in, a river that could not be pa&s;&s;ed over.</HI> The Holy Spirit that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> be&s;towed upon his di&s;ciples is compared unto a <HI>well of living waters &s;pringing up unto eternal life,</HI> John iv. 14. <HI>And who&s;oever &s;hall drink of the water that I &s;hall give him, &s;hall never

I &s;hall now proceed to con&s;ider our Mediator's conduct towards his people in their mi|litant &s;tate, expre&s;&s;ed under the notion of <HI>leading them to living fountains of waters.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. HE makes them &s;en&s;ible of their wants, and leads them into an under&s;tanding of their need of &s;piritual enjoyments. By either his ordinances, or providences, he makes them &s;en&s;ible that their fir&s;t condition is a mi&s;erable one. Sometimes provi|dence di&s;appoints their hopes, and renders their mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations vain: So that what they promi&s;ed them&s;elves the greate&s;t happine&s;s in the enjoyment of, is quite taken from them, and they have the de&s;ire but not the object. The mind that is naturally full of de&s;ire, after one di&s;appoint|ment, turns it&s;elf towards &s;ome other object, and lives by hope for a &s;ea&s;on, till providence as before removes the object and eludes the expectation. Still the cry of the heart is, <HI>who will &s;hew us any good thing;</HI> and the fluctuating mind goes from one temporal object to another in &s;earch of happine&s;s and enjoy|ment, but time after time is di&s;appointed. When the&s;e &s;ources fail, the hopele&s;s &s;oul turns &s;erious, engages in a cour&s;e of religious duties, and &s;eeks comfort in ordinances; and the con&s;tant cry now is, <HI>the temple of the Lord.</HI> But no &s;ooner is a form of godline&s;s e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the &s;oul begins to place its comfort and happine&s;s in external privi|leges,
<PB N="98" REF="102">than ordinances are like worldly enjoyments before, delu&s;ionary and vain; afford no &s;olid peace nor plea&s;ure. The &s;pirit of bondage &s;hews the &s;pirit of the law, and that the de&s;ign of duty and the in|tention of ordinances, are not to be &s;een of men but to glorify God. Then the man's conduct appears to him in a wor&s;e light than before. He imagines, as is the real ca&s;e with him, that he is a &s;elf-de|ceiver, and a hypocrite; and that <HI>by &s;eeking to e|&s;tabli&s;h a righteou&s;ne&s;s of his own, he is not &s;ubject to the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God.</HI> Hence a want of righte|ou&s;ne&s;s wherewith he may come before the Lord, mightily perplexes his mind. Sometimes want of &s;incerity is all the want of righteou&s;ne&s;s that is yet thought upon.&mdash;Then he attempts to be more &s;incere; &s;trives to bring his mind to a lively and fit frame for devotion, that he may have &s;atisfac|tion in the exerci&s;e of duty, when the end of his pur&s;uit is only for &s;atisfaction to him&s;elf, but not to glorify the author of his being. His fear of hy|pocri&s;y does not ari&s;e &s;o much from an apprehen|&s;ion that it is di&s;honouring to God, as that it will provoke him to puni&s;h the guilty &s;oul for &s;uch &s;o|lemn di&s;&s;imulation. But after, by renewed efforts of indu&s;try, the man has brought his mind to the conceived mea&s;ure he would be at, he is ready to conclude he has attained to the de&s;ired point of en|quiry: When behold the mind that never re&s;ts in its &s;earches, finds out the error of deficiency in the end. The cau&s;e of this is <HI>the Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne,</HI> by a new manife&s;tation of the &s;pirit of the law upon the con&s;cience, convincing the per&s;on that no action is acceptable that is not directed to a good and holy end. Where to find out a mean to amend this error is not ea&s;ily found; for the no|tion of &s;elf-importance is natural to every irregene|rate per&s;on, and to get clear of our own importance in the performance of duty, is above the power of
<PB N="99" REF="103">corrupt nature. The brightne&s;s of legal evidence &s;till increa&s;es again&s;t the &s;inner; he &s;ees the com|mandments true and holy, and the &s;anction &s;ure; but &s;inds no will or power to love its holine&s;s, nor a way to evade its cur&s;e. A want, a mi&s;erable want, now occurs to him; a want of power to keep the law of God, without which he cannot learn how God will be plea&s;ed with him. He had already tried to ob&s;erve the Divine commandments, but found him&s;elf far &s;hort in both end and motive. Will God accept of another attempt to &s;erve him better, with more &s;incerity, with a view to his glory? is again &s;ugge&s;ted, but not &s;o ea&s;ily concluded upon.</P>
<P>A NOTION of repentance for former &s;ins, and &s;orrow for pa&s;t faults and offences, is now deter|mined, and the man is now all humility, prayer and tears.&mdash;This cour&s;e is plea&s;ing for a &s;ea&s;on, and the &s;inner is now bu&s;y in making an atonement to God for his former &s;ins and in&s;incerity. But as it is natural for our minds to enquire into future con&s;e|quences, this laborious penitent cannot long con|tinue in this cour&s;e, without enquiring what will be the end, and for what u&s;e this repentance is. One thing was neglected at the beginning, which creates more &s;orrow and trouble in the end: Will God accept of this my repentance for an atonement for my former offences? This is a que&s;tion that the con&s;cience cannot be long in &s;u&s;pen&s;e about, &s;o &s;oon as it looks to God's holy law: For repentance, be it never &s;o &s;incere, cannot make atonement for &s;in; becau&s;e the law of God is infinitely perfect, and the &s;inner's repentance is but finite.&mdash;Be&s;ides repen|tance is nothing, if it is not attended with con|&s;tancy and uniformity in good actions: And one capital defect in this repentance is, that original &s;in is not the object of it. Had the man &s;een the nature of original &s;in, he would never attempted to
<PB N="100" REF="104">plea&s;e God by repentance, becau&s;e this root of bit|terne&s;s will marr the &s;ucce&s;s of repentance it&s;elf.&mdash; For it is impo&s;&s;ible for one to repent &s;incerely, when there is a propen&s;ity in their nature again&s;t the ve|ry duty.</P>
<P>NOW, and never till now, did he &s;ee the want of original righteou&s;ne&s;s. The guilt of <HI>Adam</HI>'s fir&s;t &s;in, and the corruption of nature, now marr all his hopes of ever reconciling him&s;elf to God; be&s;ides, he al&s;o &s;ees innumerable imperfections in his mo&s;t &s;incere attempts.&mdash;<HI>What &s;hall I do to be &s;aved?</HI> is a very important que&s;tion, but how to an&s;wer it he is unable.&mdash;With help he thinks this may be done, but where to find help he knows not. He fears now &s;o much as to look at the law; but con&s;cience having already got the impre&s;&s;ions of it &s;tamped there, with all the poi&s;on of the cur&s;e, there is no getting free of it.&mdash;Thus he is <HI>a magor mi&s;ibib, a terror to him&s;elf.</HI> Fears of death now haunt him like a gho&s;t: To die in this condition is really dan|gerous, and &s;carcely more &s;o than he apprehends it. A view <HI>of the Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne</HI> would be a very acceptable perception, but this in wi&s;dom is yet withheld.&mdash;He &s;ees a throne of judgment, but not of mercy. The conclu&s;ion is that he mu&s;t peri&s;h for all he hath yet &s;een. <HI>The Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne</HI> has all this while been leading him, but in &s;uch a manner as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> led <HI>I&s;rael</HI> through the wilderne&s;s; where there were many things fearful to behold. This pre|pares him for the enjoyment of the living waters that he leads him afterwards into. In &s;uch ways does <HI>Je&s;us</HI> &s;ometimes lead his people, when he brings them <HI>to the fountains of living water.</HI> This makes them &s;en&s;ible of their wants, and makes the Divine goodne&s;s reli&s;h &s;weetly when it is enjoyed.&mdash; Now the &s;oul is &s;en&s;ible of a want of righteou&s;ne&s;s to ju&s;tify it, and a want of meetne&s;s to make it fit
<PB N="101" REF="105">for communion with God. We have ob&s;erved that ordinances and providences are made u&s;e of to make men &s;en&s;ible of their wants.&mdash;The word &s;trips the &s;inner, thus convinced, naked of all de|fence in him&s;elf, and makes him &s;ee that all his for|mer attempts to cover him&s;elf with his fig-leaves are vain; <HI>when the commandment comes</HI> powerfully, <HI>&s;in revives and the man dies.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. HE makes known to them his own excel|lencies and fitne&s;s to reconcile them unto God. Nothing can be more agreeable and de&s;irable to a mind under a &s;en&s;e of apprehended wrath and judg|ment, than the di&s;covery of one <HI>who is able and willing to &s;ave.</HI> The go&s;pel of the grace of God reveals that object. <HI>The Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne</HI> brings the <HI>glad tidings of peace and great joy</HI> to the &s;inner's ear, and gives the favourable inti|mation, that <HI>he is made of God, wi&s;dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;anctification and redemption.</HI> The &s;oul, we ob&s;erved before, was made &s;en&s;ible of its want of righteou&s;|ne&s;s for acceptance before God. The Redeemer in the go&s;pel &s;ays, <HI>Behold I bring near my righteou&s;|ne&s;s, and my &s;alvation &s;hall not tarry.</HI> The appre|hen&s;ion of this righteou&s;ne&s;s, when revealed, is yet beyond the reach of a natural man; and the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is abundantly manife&s;ted in leading his people forward to a dependence upon him, for power to apply his righteou&s;ne&s;s, as well as to depend upon him for working it out.</P>
<P>WHEN men are brought to a &s;en&s;e of their ab&s;olute mi&s;ery, without <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and made &s;en&s;ible of their own weakne&s;s, it is ordinary to tell them they &s;hould embrace him; but could they do this, it would be doing more than even keeping the law perfectly. This is as impo&s;&s;ible to that &s;oul that is not changed, as any former duty mentioned. <HI>The Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne</HI> mu&s;t work this work him&s;elf; namely, work the power by which
<PB N="102" REF="106">they apprehend him. They mu&s;t be fir&s;t appre|hended of him, before they can apprehend him: This is the language of the apo&s;tle <HI>Paul, I endea|vour to apprehend him, of whom I am al&s;o apprehended.</HI> The fir&s;t is an endeavour that flows from the latter. The word of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> is &s;ent with power to the &s;oul in a more direct manner, and gives &s;trength to it to believe, before there can be any &s;pecial embra|cing of him as our Lord. Our appropriating of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to our&s;elves, or that &s;pecial particular faith, which is the privilege of the children of God, is no more but the love of God working in the con&s;cience, and expre&s;&s;ing it&s;elf by embracing an object it de|lights in. I indeed &s;incerely allow of an appropri|ating faith; but refu&s;e that all the exhortations in the world can effect it; or if it were done in obe|dience to the commandment and exhortation, could it ju&s;tify us, otherwi&s;e we would be ju&s;tified by a work of the law.</P>
<P>BOTH the ground and means of our ju&s;tification are without us, as they are duties: Both are the work of <HI>the Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne.</HI> None of the &s;cripture commandments to believe, are to be under&s;tood as having the promi&s;e of ju&s;tifica|tion and &s;alvation connected with them, (as the&s;e duties are done by us); otherwi&s;e our ju&s;tification would &s;till depend upon our&s;elves. For when it is &s;aid, <HI>Believe in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t and thou &s;halt be &s;aved;</HI> it no doubt implies, that faith is our du|ty, but will not infer that we can obey it till it be given us. The&s;e words &s;hew the nece&s;&s;ity of faith, but do not mention the cau&s;e of it. <HI>It is not of our&s;elves, it is the gift of God:</HI> In that phra&s;e we may &s;ee the connection between faith and &s;alvation, but cannot learn that faith is an act that we can put forth when we plea&s;e. The Divine order of faith, but not the Divine cau&s;e, is there mentioned. The apo&s;tles point out the method of &s;alvation to the
<PB N="103" REF="107">jailot, without mentioning unto him the powerful cau&s;e, that only could make him comply with that method.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne</HI> pre&s;ents to the &s;oul, in the day of believing, his own righte|ou&s;ne&s;s and excellencies, and impre&s;&s;es their fitne&s;s &s;o powerfully upon the mind, that it makes way into the heart by melting it. Thus the &s;oul re|ceives a new form by the power of Divine grace: The evidence of the fitne&s;s and goodne&s;s of the Redeemer's excellencies for holine&s;s and happine&s;s, makes way into the &s;oul, and changes it as a clear and convincing truth will change one's &s;entiments, and form their thoughts into a liking for that truth. Our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> when he leads his people into the under&s;tanding of his own fitne&s;s and ex|cellency, performs a work that no human energy could effect, no per&s;ua&s;ion of men produce. All that men can &s;ay of him, without the &s;pecial power of his grace, will make but &s;mall impre&s;&s;ion upon the &s;oul. There is a more direct impul&s;e nece&s;&s;ary. The excellencies of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> &s;et forth by human com|mendation, are like the rays of the &s;un di&s;&s;ipated and &s;cattered; but when impre&s;&s;ed by his own more immediate power, are like the rays of the &s;un con|tracted into a meni&s;cus or burning gla&s;s, that burns as well as gives light. This is expre&s;&s;ed by the apo&s;tle, <HI>The light of the glory of God in the face of Je&s;us &s;hining into the &s;oul.</HI> This is a peculiar and &s;pecial part of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s divine admini&s;tration in <HI>lead|ing his people.</HI> By this he leads them out of them|&s;elves to a dependence upon him; and as the love|line&s;s of his character begets love in their &s;ouls, that which is truly called appropriation, is the love of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in the &s;oul making free with its object. This is an effect of that faith whereby men are ju&s;tified. Faith is the gift of God, and the appro|priation of faith is this Divine gift improving or
<PB N="104" REF="108">making u&s;e of its object. Faith takes hold of the te&s;timony where a Saviour is held forth; but the evidence of the truth of the te&s;timony is fir&s;t made to &s;hine upon the &s;oul. <HI>The light of the glory of God in the face of Je&s;us &s;hines into the darkened under&s;tand|ing,</HI> and repre&s;ents <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> to the mind in all his fitne&s;s and loveline&s;s. The evidence of the truth of his per&s;on and character, determines the &s;oul to re&s;t upon him for &s;alvation. Thus the ap|propriation follows, not precedes an intere&s;t in <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> Our acceptance with God is not founded upon our appropriation of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> but upon his atonement, which is the meritorious cau&s;e of that grace which enables us to believe in him.</P>
<P>THIS admini&s;tration of the Son of God, in <HI>leading his people to him&s;elf,</HI> is full of the greate&s;t wi&s;dom: For unle&s;s he drew them, they neither would nor could apprehend him. Therefore he fir&s;t apprehends them by his &s;pirit; writes the truth in their hearts, and they become his. They are ju&s;tified before God, and accepted of by him, not becau&s;e they have received <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> their Lord, but becau&s;e he hath taken them into a relation to him as their &s;urety. The whole ground of our ac|ceptance is what <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> hath done, both to us and for us, and not what we our&s;elves have done in any degree. The believing of the Divine record, in which <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is comprehended, is the mo&s;t rational act the &s;oul can put forth; but it is an act that does not proceed from any natural power that is in the mind, till it be given it by <HI>Je&s;us.</HI> The power of the word fir&s;t overcomes the enmity, by repre&s;ent|ing a worthy object, before there be any love or de|&s;ire in the &s;oul towards a Saviour; <HI>Je&s;us</HI> in all his lovely excellencies is brought near in a word of truth, and this like a &s;eal is imprinted upon the &s;oul, and gives it a new form. It is the &s;oul thus formed new that applies <HI>Je&s;us</HI> for comfort, as contained in the te&s;|timony
<PB N="105" REF="109">of the word. But this after-comfort, is only an effect of the principle of faith before implanted by the &s;pirit of the go&s;pel, or is faith working by love. It is a confounding of ju&s;tification with a work of &s;anctification, to affirm that men mu&s;t ap|propriate <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to them&s;elves before they can be ju&s;tified, or making our &s;anctification the ground and rea&s;on of our acceptance with God: For it is certain whoever is able to receive <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> mu&s;t have power, and that power mu&s;t be given them, which is no more but enabling the &s;oul to act according to the word of God. Therefore it follows from this, that men are accepted not on the account of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s atonement, but on the account of the work of the Spirit in &s;anctification; whereas the apo&s;to|lic doctrine runs, <HI>whom he ju&s;tifies, them he al&s;o &s;anc|tifies.</HI> The Divine connection ob&s;erved in the con|duct of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> in &s;aving his people, and lead|ing them to everla&s;ting happine&s;s, is worthy of our mo&s;t &s;erious attention. When &s;inners are ju&s;tified, they are &s;aid to be ju&s;tified by <HI>the redemption that is in Je&s;us;</HI> by having an intere&s;t therein: This in|tere&s;t they obtain by faith: This faith they have by free gift, and not of them&s;elves: So when faith accepts of the atonement for ju&s;tification, it is no more but the &s;pirit of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> enabling the &s;oul to ob&s;erve the connection e&s;tabli&s;hed in the covenant of grace. Here is no foundation for human pride or boa&s;ting, &s;ince the power by which this connec|tion is ob&s;erved, is not men's own, but the gift of God working in their con&s;cience, or the <HI>love of Chri&s;t con&s;training</HI> the &s;oul to receive the atonement.</P>
<P>IT is &s;till evident that our ju&s;tification, both as to cau&s;e, and immediate means, as to beginning and end, is the work of <HI>the Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne.</HI> That faith that is e&s;tabli&s;hed in the con|nection of means in the covenant of grace, without which we cannot be ju&s;tified, is wrought in the &s;oul
<PB N="106" REF="110">by the power of God. The apo&s;tle tells us, <HI>He works in us the work of faith with power.</HI> When <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> makes known his own excellencies and fit|ne&s;s to the &s;ouls of his people, like a true load&s;tone he draws out their love to him, and brings them near; <HI>the love of Chri&s;t con&s;trains them:</HI> So their acts of faith and love, are only effects of that <HI>con&s;training love of Chri&s;t</HI> impre&s;&s;ed upon the &s;oul. The&s;e acts of faith that are &s;o often mentioned in &s;ome treati&s;es, and required of men before they be ju&s;tified, are ra|tionally accounted for; only, by rightly under&s;tand|ing the admini&s;tration of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as <HI>the Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne who leads his people.</HI> The ap|propriation of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> for &s;alvation, is ju&s;t the &s;ame thing with <HI>do and live,</HI> unle&s;s we under&s;tand this as the effect of his own power in his new covenant admi|ni&s;tration. Before ever a fallen &s;inner can accept of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> for ju&s;tification, the Redeemer mu&s;t fir&s;t take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heart, and by the glory of his divine excellencies captivate the &s;oul. This is an act of his kingly power whereby he &s;ubdues the &s;oul to the obedience of faith.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne leads his people to him&s;elf,</HI> by &s;uch a glorious di&s;play of his excellencies and fitne&s;s to reconcile them unto God, that the evidence that attends this di&s;play of his glory, captivates the heart, and fills the whole &s;oul with love.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE <HI>Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne leads his</HI> militant members through many trials and afflic|tions after they become his. <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> told his di&s;ciples, <HI>that &s;uch as followed him, mu&s;t al&s;o take up their cro&s;s, and deny them&s;elves.</HI> It is the con&s;tant doc|trine of the New Te&s;tament, <HI>that them that live god|ly in this world &s;hall &s;uffer per&s;ecution.</HI> By afflic|tions and trials in this life, the <HI>followers of the Lamb</HI> are made meet for that which is to come. <HI>Je&s;us</HI> leads all his followers in the &s;ame path that he him&s;elf
<PB N="107" REF="111">walked in; and as <HI>the captain of their &s;alvation was made perfect through &s;ufferings,</HI> &s;o mu&s;t all tho&s;e who are his &s;incere followers. The <HI>followers of the Lamb</HI> are be&s;t known by their re&s;ignation to &s;uffering and &s;elf-denial. When men are followers of religion, when every advantage attend-it, the lovers of the world, and the lovers of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> are not ea&s;ily di&s;|tingui&s;hed. That religion that has no cro&s;s attend|ing it, bears not the marks of the apo&s;tolic reli|gion: For the apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays of him&s;elf, <HI>that bonds and per&s;ecution awaited him in every place.</HI> The cro&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is intended for his people's very great ad|vantage: To keep them in con&s;tant dependence up|on him, and <HI>to &s;tain the pride of all human glory.</HI> By the&s;e two the primitive chri&s;tians were di&s;tingui&s;hed from the world; namely, the patient <HI>bearing of the cro&s;s, and denying them&s;elves.</HI> They rejoiced that <HI>they were counted worthy to &s;uffer &s;hame for the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</HI> and denied them&s;elves the ea&s;e and carnal plea&s;ure, that was obtained by compliance with the world. Their e&s;teem of religion proceed|ed from their love to its author, and not from the&s;e appendages that worldly men afterwards connected with it. Had they had an inclination to have en|joyed the advantages that afterwards many connec|ted with chri&s;tianity, they might no doubt have had their own &s;hare; but they were &s;en&s;ible that this was incompatible with what <HI>Je&s;us</HI> had told them, of the cro&s;s and &s;elf-denial. The many &s;uf|ferings the&s;e fir&s;t chri&s;tians were expo&s;ed unto, aro&s;e from their non-conformity to the reigning cu&s;toms; and it was a &s;pecial evidence of their &s;elf-denial, when they could for the &s;ake of <HI>pure and undefiled religion</HI> forego the &s;miles of the world, and the allure|ments of pre-eminence, wealth, and e&s;teem. It is the certain way to the crown of everla&s;ting life, to walk in the way of &s;elf-denial and afflictions. <HI>The Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne</HI> never led his people
<PB N="108" REF="112">in any other path. Tho' religion, fal&s;ly &s;o called, has had its own time of reigning under the protec|tion of civil power, yet <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s kingdom never was of this world. Tho&s;e reigning &s;y&s;tems that were attended with worldly advantages, power, and pre-eminence, were palpable deviations from the apo&s;|tolic &s;y&s;tem. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> never intended power and preference as the privilege of his followers; but a&s;&s;ured them that <HI>they &s;hould be hated of all men for his name's &s;ake,</HI> which was a part of the cro&s;s they were to bear.&mdash;And in&s;tead of accepting places of power and advancement, they were <HI>to deny them|&s;elves</HI> to the&s;e allurements, as <HI>pertaining to the king|doms of this world,</HI> of which they were to be civil &s;ubjects, but never religious rulers or lords.</P>
<P>THE <HI>followers of the Lamb</HI> mu&s;t not think when they become his, that then the &s;miles of providence, and the approbation of every devotee to the name of chri&s;tianity, will be their privilege: The contrary they mu&s;t expect. If they become true children of God thro' <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t, fal&s;e brethren, mothers, chil|dren, will hate them.</HI> This is often the heavie&s;t branch of the chri&s;tian's cro&s;s, <HI>to be de&s;pi&s;ed and hated</HI> by tho&s;e who have as high preten&s;ions to religion as them&s;elves. An in&s;tance of this we have in the ca&s;e of <HI>David,</HI> P&s;. xlii. 3. <HI>My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually &s;ay unto me, Where is thy God? When I remember the&s;e</HI> things, <HI>I pour out my &s;oul in me; for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them into the hou&s;e of God.</HI> Self-denial has always been accounted, as it really is, a &s;ingula|rity in religion. Such as join the notions of chri&s;|tianity and worldly e&s;teem and advantage together, have ever &s;ince the reign of <HI>Tiberius</HI> looked upon &s;elf-denial and the cro&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> with an evil eye.</P>
<P>THE excellent few who could not be conformed to the world, becau&s;e their con&s;ciences would not allow them, and their love to <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> directed
<PB N="109" REF="113">them otherwi&s;e, have been looked upon as fooli&s;h &s;ticklers for unnece&s;&s;ary &s;ingularities. The men who loved to model the kingdom of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> into the form of the kingdoms of this world, have al|ways e&s;teemed the plain &s;imple followers of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> as con&s;cientious fools, who would not lay down the cro&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> when better offers were made them. It was <HI>the Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne</HI> that kept them from embracing a religion that was not his, but a creature of worldly power, and led them through all the reproaches of &s;uch as called them&s;elves by the magnificent name of the CHRISTIAN WORLD.</P>
<P>WHEN men are truly converted to the religion of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> they are deceived if they expect that he will lead them in the way of worldly e|&s;teem: <HI>They mu&s;t follow the foot&s;teps of his flock, and go forth without the camp, bearing reproach for the name of Chri&s;t;</HI> and with the apo&s;tle, <HI>count all things but lo&s;s and dung, that they may win Chri&s;t, and be found in him, not having their own righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of the law, but that which is of God by faith.</HI></P>
<P>THIS branch of the Redeemer's admini&s;tration, is that whereby he keeps up the di&s;tinction between his children and the children of this world. Self-denial is the true&s;t mark of a follower of <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> for it is directly oppo&s;ite to that notion of &s;elf-im|portance and dependence, that is the leading prin|ciple of the &s;elf-righteous of every character: It is the harde&s;t le&s;&s;on in the whole chri&s;tian &s;cheme for men to learn. There are very many who pre|tend to follow <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> that are like the woman mentioned in <HI>I&s;a.</HI> iv. 1. who want only <HI>to be called by his name,</HI> but love to &s;upport the notion of their own independence; <HI>the&s;e have a name to live, but are really dead.</HI> The true &s;incere <HI>followers of the Lamb</HI> are led to depend upon him for all things; <HI>for wi&s;dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;anctification, and redemption.</HI></P>
<PB N="110" REF="114">
<P>THOSE whom <HI>the Lamb leadeth</HI> are denied to their highe&s;t attainments, and only depend upon that fir&s;t grace which di&s;tingui&s;hed them from the world. Their right to happine&s;s, and their walk|ing in peace, they attribute to that unchangeable word <HI>that pa&s;&s;eth not away,</HI> which fir&s;t gave them life, and &s;till &s;upports them in it. The religious, or rather the &s;uper&s;titious world, who are power|fully governed by the notion of independence, ge|nerally lay a mightly &s;tre&s;s upon their attainments, and reckon them&s;elves intitled to a higher degree of the favour of the Deity than others, becau&s;e they can give a better account of their attainments, and lay a greater weight upon what they call experien|ces, than upon that invariable te&s;timony which contains the &s;ub&s;tance of both their happine&s;s and the ground of their faith. They are &s;o far from <HI>denying them&s;elves,</HI> that, the higher their notions of their own attainments are, they are the more proud. This is evidenced from their &s;overeign contempt of others, who cannot &s;ay that they have gone through the &s;ame exerci&s;e with them. <HI>The followers of the Lamb,</HI> in the apo&s;tolic times, <HI>who were led by him,</HI> founded their e&s;teem of them&s;elves and others upon that one profe&s;&s;ion of faith in <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> and the &s;imilitude of the tenor of their lives to that profe&s;|&s;ion. Their love was founded upon that which was vi&s;ible to every one, namely, their profe&s;&s;ion of their faith in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and the working thereof by love; and not upon what no man can &s;ee &s;o as to be certain of. Whoever adhered unto the &s;ame te&s;timony of truth, which was vi&s;ible without them, and lived according to its purity, were the objects of their e&s;teem.</P>
<P>THEY did not &s;et up their own attainments and experiences as the &s;tandard to others, and the rule of their love and e&s;teem of them; but the Divine te&s;timony which <HI>Je&s;us</HI> had left them. They
<PB N="111" REF="115">loved tho&s;e who loved <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and evidenced their love by embracing his true religion. The whole rule of their love of others was without them, not within them. They left men's hearts to him <HI>who &s;earcheth the hearts of the &s;ons of men,</HI> and lived only from external evidence. Their love was ca|tholic and univer&s;al towards all who profe&s;t the common faith of chri&s;tians, &s;o long as they conti|nued in obedience to that faith; but they extended not their e&s;teem to any, differing from them in the faith of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> whatever preten&s;ions they had to attainments and experience in religion. As they acknowledged but <HI>one Lord,</HI> &s;o they had but <HI>one faith</HI> which <HI>wrought by love</HI> to all who profe&s;t it.</P>
<P>THESE primitive <HI>followers of the Lamb,</HI> were &s;olely directed in all their actions by tho&s;e rules their Lord and Saviour had given them. They denied them&s;elves to dependence upon human pre|ten&s;ions or inventions. The <HI>&s;ure word of prophecy,</HI> was the foundation to them of the exerci&s;e of every chri&s;tian grace or virtue. Modern times have pro|duced a chri&s;tian world, but the primitive chri&s;tians always kept them&s;elves di&s;tinct from the world, and looked upon the world and chri&s;tianity as having &s;eparate intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>THE account that chri&s;tians could give of their adherence to the faith of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> in the go&s;pel, and not an account of &s;o many convictions and round|about workings of the human mind, was the rule they judged of men by. <HI>The Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne</HI> taught them to deny all the&s;e, as a part of that &s;elfi&s;h di&s;po&s;ition that &s;ets it&s;elf in oppo&s;ition to the go&s;pel. <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> teaches men to re&s;t upon the word, as the true ground of <HI>hope, faith, and a&s;&s;urance;</HI> but to re&s;t upon no man's account of his own frame and di&s;po&s;ition. Our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> him&s;elf never required of any to believe in him for his inward frame and di&s;po&s;ition, but on
<PB N="112" REF="116">account of his works: <HI>If I do not the works which no other man can do, believe me not.</HI></P>
<P>IT is an eminent degree of &s;elf-denial, to have no dependence upon the&s;e things which to us may &s;eem our be&s;t and mo&s;t &s;piritual actions or exer|ci&s;es. The great leader of the New Te&s;tament, leads all his &s;incere followers to depend upon him <HI>for all things,</HI> in oppo&s;ition unto our own be&s;t en|deavours and performances. This to many will appear no &s;mall affliction and trial, and certainly is an high degree of &s;elf-denial; but <HI>the Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne</HI> will bring his people out of all &s;uch affliction at la&s;t.</P>
<P>HOWEVER unfavourable like the cro&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> may appear to worldly men, and however unrea&s;on|able &s;elf-denial may &s;eem to the devotees of inde|pendence, yet according to the New Te&s;tament none are <HI>the followers of the Lamb,</HI> but &s;uch as <HI>take up their cro&s;s and deny them&s;elves.</HI> The world ever thought the bearing of the cro&s;s and &s;elf-denial di&s;agreeable le&s;&s;ons to learn. That &s;elf-e&s;teem and love to wealth and pre-eminence, that is &s;o natural to the men of this world, will always re&s;i&s;t men's inclinations to <HI>bear the cro&s;s and deny them&s;elves.</HI> Tho&s;e that were the leaders of the fa&s;hion in the primitive times, like tho&s;e who are their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors &s;till, were no doubt &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee men <HI>&s;ell their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions,</HI> and di&s;tribute them for the &s;upply of needy chri&s;tians. Such a mark of &s;elf-denial was no doubt then, as it &s;till is, an eminent piece of fooli&s;h &s;in|gularity in the eyes of the wi&s;e men of this world. The followers of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> had their affections <HI>&s;et upon things that are above,</HI> and could the more ea&s;ily part with tho&s;e things that are below. Yet for men to part with <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, hou&s;es and lands, wives and children,</HI> for the &s;ake of religion, and be ac|counted fools for it after all, was &s;uch a degree of &s;elf denial that the primitive periods only produced.
<PB N="113" REF="117"><HI>The Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne</HI> enabled his con|fe&s;&s;ors and followers to de&s;pi&s;e the&s;e temporal things, by filling their &s;ouls with the comfort of the Holy Gho&s;t. <HI>He led them to living fountains of wa|ters,</HI> made them receive the Holy Gho&s;t, which &s;o filled their &s;ouls with joy and delight, that they thought little of all worldly advantages and e&s;teem.</P>
<P>THE Divine joy and comfort with which their &s;ouls were filled, wrought &s;o powerfully in their minds, that their cro&s;s &s;eemed light and ea&s;y, and &s;elf-denial and &s;uffering was to them rather <HI>a crown of rejoicing,</HI> than <HI>burden&s;ome and grievous.</HI> Then chri&s;tians under&s;tood religion in its own native light, as di&s;tinct from the world, and had no am|bition for what they were per&s;uaded was never de|&s;igned them. The life of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> they made choice of for their pattern, who in all his life-time in this world kept him&s;elf di&s;tinct from its manners, plea&s;ures, and allurements; who &s;aid of him&s;elf, <HI>The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have ne&s;ts; but the &s;on of man hath not where to lay his head.</HI> So long as chri&s;tians followed him, they were like him, in denying them&s;elves the&s;e plea&s;ures and ad|vantages that belong only to the world. But after men began to vary from the example of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> the que&s;tion that was once in agitation among&s;t the di&s;ciples, <HI>who &s;hould be greate&s;t?</HI> became the chief enquiry of tho&s;e called chri&s;tians.&mdash;And now in&s;tead of <HI>following the Lamb,</HI> in <HI>bearing the cro&s;s, and deny|ing them&s;elves,</HI> men profe&s;&s;ing his religion contend|ed with the powers of the world for power and pre|ference: Till at la&s;t the chri&s;tian religion became &s;o like the world that they interchanged names, and chri&s;tianity got the new appellation of the CHRISTIAN WORLD.</P>
<P>BUT whatever trials and afflictions may ari&s;e to the follower of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> from the want of the&s;e temporal things, <HI>the Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne
<PB N="114" REF="118">leads them</HI> thro' the&s;e difficulties, and by the com|forts of the Holy Spirit, the&s;e <HI>fountains of living waters</HI> make up the want of all the&s;e left-hand ble&s;&s;ings. By electing them into the &s;ecrets of his covenant, and &s;upporting them with the &s;weets of the promi&s;es, he leads them on to the borders of his &s;anctuary, to <HI>the tabernacle that his own right-hand hath pitched for them</HI> in his kingdom of glory.</P>
<P N="4">4. ANOTHER branch of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s admini&s;tration as <HI>the Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne</HI> towards his church in her militant &s;tate is, that <HI>he leads his peo|ple through death.</HI> We have abundant evidence that death is the common lot of mankind from a long and &s;triking experience of good and bad:&mdash; <HI>The wi&s;e man dieth, and the bruti&s;h al&s;o:</HI>&mdash;And <HI>Job</HI> tells us, <HI>that there is an appointed time for man upon earth:</HI>&mdash;And the apo&s;tle, <HI>it is appointed for all men once to die, and after that the judgment:</HI> But why <HI>good men &s;hould die,</HI> for whom <HI>the Son of God laid down his life,</HI> &s;eems not &s;o ea&s;y to be accounted for. Should I affirm that &s;incere believers in <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> do not die, if we under&s;tand death in its proper meaning, it will perhaps be neare&s;t the doctrine of the New Te&s;tament. <HI>The Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne</HI> who died for them, only <HI>leads them through death.</HI> It is only like a &s;tage in their journey, which they mu&s;t pa&s;s thro', but do not abide in. The a|po&s;tle, 1 <HI>The&s;&s;.</HI> iv. 14. compares death to a <HI>&s;leep,</HI> &s;o far as it extends to believers:&mdash;<HI>Them al&s;o who &s;leep in Je&s;us will God bring with him:</HI> The prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> compares it to a place of re&s;t:&mdash;<HI>They &s;hall re&s;t in their beds, each one walking in his uprightne&s;s.</HI> This change of believers, takes the name of death from its common likene&s;s to the death of others, and hath received the common denomination from its common external appearance. But in truth, is only like the beginning of life to the <HI>followers of the Lamb.</HI> The <HI>living fountains of waters</HI> which <HI>the
<PB N="115" REF="119">Lamb leads his followers into,</HI> makes them <HI>live for ever.</HI> The leader him&s;elf &s;ays to his di&s;ciples, <HI>He that drinketh of the waters that I &s;hall give him, &s;hall not die.</HI> The <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> compares death only to a <HI>&s;hadow</HI> that he was to pa&s;s through: <HI>When I pa&s;s through the valley and &s;hadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou</HI> art <HI>with me, thy rod and thy &s;taff they comfort me.</HI></P>
<P>THE rea&s;on why <HI>the followers of the Lamb die</HI> is, that they may be true followers of him, and be exalted from the &s;ame low degree of humiliation. He leads them through death, that they may &s;ee all the excellencies of his death and &s;ufferings; that they may behold that which is mo&s;t formidable to human nature in the mo&s;t intimate manner, and &s;ee that it is by the death of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> dive&s;ted of its &s;ting. Every true chri&s;tian, by pa&s;&s;ing through death, &s;ees experimentally that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> hath overcome it; and what they were by faith per&s;uaded of before, they now &s;en&s;ibly experience <HI>The Lamb leads them thro' death</HI> that they may be &s;harers of that victory which he obtained over it, and really find that it has no power. By leading them through death, he gives them occa&s;ion to triumph with the apo&s;tle, <HI>O death where is thy &s;ting! O grave where is thy victory!</HI></P>
<P>WERE chri&s;tians tran&s;ported to heaven with|out going thro' death, it would be a great di&s;ad|vantage to them: For they could not know by ex|perience that what is &s;o frightful to human nature, is by the death of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> made &s;o ea&s;y, and con&s;e|quently there would be a defect in their experience. Death to the followers of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> is not an immediate effect of the cur&s;e, but a part of that conformity to their Saviour which they attain unto by following him.&mdash;Thus it is a privilege, not a di&s;advantage. The apo&s;tle informs us, <HI>that death po&s;&s;ed upon all men, for all had &s;inned;</HI> but this refers unto the &s;en|tence
<PB N="116" REF="120">of condemnation that was upon all men on account of their being de&s;cendents of the fir&s;t <HI>Adam</HI> under the cur&s;e of the law.&mdash;But <HI>the followers of the Lamb</HI> are freed from condemnation, on the account of his being <HI>made a cur&s;e for them:</HI>&mdash;And <HI>there is no condemnation to them that are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI>&mdash;Therefore death to them does not flow from the cur&s;e of the law; nor do they die &s;o much becau&s;e they have &s;inned, but becau&s;e it is a part of their conformity to <HI>Je&s;us, to walk in the &s;ame path that he walked in.</HI></P>
<P>THAT chri&s;tians may have a true experience how ea&s;y the way to heaven and happine&s;s is, on the account of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> having gone before them in it, they mu&s;t follow him thro' every &s;tage or the way, that they may admire him in all that he hath done. <HI>The Lamb leads his followers thro' death,</HI> not from any nece&s;&s;ity ari&s;ing from death's claim upon them; but that he may <HI>change their vile bodies,</HI> and as it were leave their fle&s;hly garments in the ward|robe of the grave, to be rai&s;ed up new <HI>&s;hining rai|ments</HI> at <HI>the re&s;urrection of the ju&s;t. Je&s;us Chri&s;t leads his people thro' death,</HI> that they may &s;ee all that it can do unto them, and receive from them all that is its own. Nothing that pertains to a chri&s;|tian belongs to death, but their <HI>earthly hou&s;e of this tabernacle,</HI> which it only can di&s;&s;olve, but not de|&s;troy; for there is nothing about the chri&s;tian that is properly his that can die.&mdash;Even his body which is laid in the grave does not die (if we &s;peak pro|perly) but <HI>re&s;ts.</HI> By pa&s;&s;ing thro' death, <HI>the follow|er of the Lamb</HI> &s;ees the whole of its power, and its de&s;ign to him. It as it were catches all his gar|ments but cannot touch him&s;elf.</P>
<P>WHAT may properly be termed the believer's &s;elf, pa&s;&s;es through death untouched, and his body which he leaves behind him re&s;ts in peace, but is not detained like a pri&s;oner. When he pa&s;&s;es through
<PB N="117" REF="121">death he &s;ees the advantage of the death of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> that hath de&s;troyed that enemy, and taken away its &s;ting. <HI>The Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne</HI> in this part of his admini&s;tration, lets his children &s;ee how perfectly he hath freed them from the cur&s;e; that no part of the threatning of the law can hurt them. Death was the threatning denounced again&s;t men for &s;in, but now they &s;ee that there is no danger in it <HI>to them that are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> It is only <HI>the &s;hadow of death</HI> to them. Now they go through it in triumph, &s;aying, <HI>O death where is thy &s;ting! O grave where is thy victory! The &s;ting of death is &s;in, and the &s;trength of &s;in is the law; but thanks be to God who hath given us the victory through our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>I PROCEED now to con&s;ider the admini&s;tra|tion of <HI>the Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne</HI> to|wards his church and people, in their trium|phant &s;tate in the kingdom of glory.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE <HI>Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne</HI> &s;ets them free from all the cau&s;es and effects of &s;in and &s;orrow. The very being of &s;in being now removed, there is no &s;uch bitter exerci&s;e as repentance and &s;orrow for &s;in.&mdash;No fears haunt the&s;e regions of bli&s;s, be|cau&s;e no ve&s;tiges of &s;in remain, nor can enter there: No apprehen&s;ions of Divine anger are there, be|cau&s;e the love and favour of God doth for ever &s;hine upon that happy &s;ociety.

<PB N="118" REF="122">their be&s;t condition, were liable to be impre&s;&s;ed with apprehen&s;ions of wrath for &s;in and &s;hort-coming, and to be &s;tained with guilt, have now the fulle&s;t &s;en&s;e of a&s;&s;ured bli&s;s.</P>
<P>THEIR liberty con&s;i&s;ts now in being freed from all fear: For the perfection of love ca&s;ts it all out. They have al&s;o the fulle&s;t de&s;ires to &s;erve God and the Lamb: The apo&s;tle tells us <HI>they re&s;t not day nor night, but &s;ing hallelujahs to him that &s;its upon the throne and to the Lamb for ever and ever.</HI></P>
<P>THESE <HI>living fountains of waters</HI> that overflow in heaven, the&s;e glorious outlettings of Divine love fill the &s;ouls of the followers of the Lamb with a &s;weet &s;en&s;e of Divine liberty; a &s;en&s;e of guilt, or ap|prehen&s;ions of Divine anger, or fears of tempta|tions overcoming virtue, make the chri&s;tian even in his be&s;t &s;tate, not to &s;erve with that liberty he will do when all the&s;e are removed. In heaven believers experience the true&s;t and fulle&s;t &s;en&s;e of liberty: They feel their con&s;ciences di&s;entangled from all apprehen&s;ions of either &s;inning or &s;uf|fering.</P>
<P N="2">2. HE leads them to the mo&s;t full and intimate communion with God. <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> pre&s;ents his followers <HI>before God without &s;pot or wrinkle, or any &s;uch thing:</HI> And leads them into &s;uch an immediate knowledge and acquaintance with the Deity, as &s;uper&s;edes the nece&s;&s;ity of enquiry into his charac|ter by means as formerly.&mdash;This is expre&s;&s;ed by the apo&s;tle by the emphatic phra&s;e of, <HI>&s;eeing face to face, and knowing as we are known.</HI> That com|munion which men enjoy with God in this life con|&s;i&s;ts in the knowing and under&s;tanding his charac|ter by the means he hath appointed.&mdash;It is like a communion kept up by di&s;tant corre&s;pondence, in a te&s;timony brought near by me&s;&s;engers, where the amiable character of <HI>Jehovah</HI> is &s;o lively drawn that it affects the heart, and begets a &s;imilitude of
<PB N="119" REF="123">&s;entiment.&mdash;But the communion that the Lamb leads his followers into, re&s;embles per&s;onal acquaint|ance, where all the charms of immediate vi&s;ion and fruition are enjoyed. The God of love now &s;hines forth in the radiance of his lovely nature to the &s;ouls of beings made meet to enjoy his endeared embraces.</P>
<P>THE &s;cripture &s;ets forth this ble&s;&s;ed communion in a bold and &s;triking view; <HI>as beholding the light of the Divine countenance; reigning for ever and ever with him; eating and drinking in his pre&s;ence:</HI> All which point out the mo&s;t full and intimate fellow|&s;hip. They do not now view God through the lattice of ordinances in an imperfect manner: They &s;ee the very brightne&s;s of his countenance. They have the mo&s;t intimate knowledge of him; for <HI>they &s;ee him as he is,</HI> and love him according to that under&s;tanding they have of him, which is perfect. The whole capacity of their &s;oul is filled with the ble&s;&s;ed di&s;coveries they have of the Deity. When we con&s;ider that all infirmities are now removed, all prejudices rooted out of the &s;oul, and add to this that the object of all true joy and delight is repre|&s;ented without any dark &s;hadows or intervening means, the communion mu&s;t be mo&s;t full and com|prehen&s;ive.</P>
<P>OUR conceptions of this communion in this life are but very faint and inadequate, and we would have had no ju&s;t views of what it is in a future &s;tate at all, if it had not been revealed unto us; but from the New Te&s;tament de&s;cription of it we may gather that it will far tran&s;cend our pre&s;ent notions of it. When we conceive of an immediate intercour&s;e with God, we are obliged to &s;ubtract from our conceptions every imperfection which at|tend human intercour&s;e, and leave room for &s;ome|thing yet unknown. For the apo&s;tle tells us, <HI>that eye hath not &s;een, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered
<PB N="120" REF="124">into the heart of man to conceive what God hath laid up for them who fear him.</HI> There will, no doubt, in another life be di&s;coveries made to the &s;aints, as much above their pre&s;ent comprehen&s;ion, as that &s;tate is above the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P N="3">3. HE affords them the mo&s;t pure and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive joy ari&s;ing from the &s;en&s;e of this communion. What before they only had a right unto, they now have a full enjoyment of, and they are now admitted to <HI>drink of the fountain of life, of the rivers of plea&s;ure at God's right-hand.</HI> In their militant &s;tate, chri&s;ti|ans are often in <HI>heavine&s;s through manifold tempta|tions;</HI> their joy is frequently intermitted; but in that &s;tate of perfection, their hope is perfect, and the true&s;t and fulle&s;t &s;en&s;e of a pre&s;ent and la&s;ting enjoyment of the highe&s;t good, affords the mo&s;t pure and con&s;tant joy. The <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> expre&s;&s;es the &s;pring of this joy under the notion of <HI>a pure foun|tain, P&s;al.</HI> xxvi. 9. that is free of all mixture. And as the cau&s;e of this joy is eternally the &s;ame, &s;o it is con&s;tant and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive. That glorious object that gave them &s;ometimes &s;uch delight and &s;atisfaction at a di&s;tance, will no doubt fill their &s;ouls with ex|ceeding great joy, when they are brought &s;o near as <HI>to &s;ee face to face,</HI> as the apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;es it. The invariablene&s;s of the object, and the refined capa|city of their &s;oul, will make them fit to enjoy a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive fulne&s;s of joy. The very &s;uitablene&s;s of the object to the mind, and its being capable to enjoy it, mu&s;t create a con&s;tant plea&s;ure. The &s;weetne&s;s of that communion, and the fulne&s;s of it, mu&s;t create a con&s;tant &s;atisfaction. Its &s;weetne&s;s creates delight, and its fulne&s;s and permanency make it la&s;ting.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne</HI> is the con|&s;tant medium through which everla&s;ting joy flows to every one of his redeemed children; and by bringing them to that &s;tate where the Divine glory
<PB N="121" REF="125">&s;hines mo&s;t remarkably through, or in his face, he for ever &s;olaces them with a complete vi&s;ion and fruition of the highe&s;t good. This joy flows from the con&s;tant excellency and beauty they behold <HI>&s;hining in the face of Je&s;us,</HI> which they are admitted to &s;ee for ever through eternity. The <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> ex|pre&s;&s;eth this joy, and the cau&s;e of it, in &s;trong and emphatical language, P&s;al. xvi. 11. <HI>In thy pre&s;ence is fulne&s;s of joy, and at thy right-hand are plea&s;ures for evermore.</HI>&mdash;This bli&s;s and happine&s;s is attributed to <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> as the author of it, as all men's views of God in heaven will con&s;tantly, will for ever, be thro' him; and our everla&s;ting peace with God will come thro' our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> No other views will men have of God, but &s;uch as come through his well-beloved Son. This ble&s;&s;ed communion, in which all their happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts, affords the mo&s;t pure and refined joy in a continued &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of raptures: The more of God they behold, the far|ther they &s;ee into the nature and extent of his Di|vine perfections: The more of his love and grace they under&s;tand, the fuller will their joy be. Joy is the triumph of the &s;oul, or the way that it ex|pre&s;&s;es its love and delight in the object it loves. When <HI>Je&s;us</HI> reveals the wonderful depths of the love of <HI>Jehovah</HI> to the glorified ho&s;ts above, the &s;cene is &s;o engaging, the &s;ight &s;o attracting, and withal the glory of the Divine love &s;o filling and &s;atisfying to a glorified &s;oul, that it cannot but be ravi&s;hed with the di&s;covery. It even overcame the apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> in this pre&s;ent world, when he began to contemplate the depths thereof, it led him out into a tran&s;port of joy; <HI>O the height! and depth! the length! and breadth of the love of God! it pa&s;&s;eth all finding out.</HI> If &s;uch a partial communion and enjoyment in a militant &s;tate, threw <HI>Paul</HI> into &s;uch raptures, what mu&s;t the overflowing depths above, in the ocean of bli&s;s, do to tho&s;e whom <HI>the Lamb
<PB N="122" REF="126">in the mid&s;t of the throne</HI> leads into all the ravi&s;hing di&s;coveries of Divine fulne&s;s of love, grace and mercy. It is the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive joy ari&s;ing from the continued communion with God, that fills their mouths with con&s;tant prai&s;es, and their tongues with &s;ongs of everla&s;ting joy. If we con&s;ider <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> as an active Being, a per&s;on in the &s;ame activity of character as when he was in this world, we mu&s;t no doubt conceive him &s;till engaged in doing his Father's bu&s;ine&s;s. As it was his bu&s;i|ne&s;s while here <HI>to &s;hew the Father</HI> to his followers and di&s;ciples, we mu&s;t not think but when he brings them to heaven, but he will &s;till more fully di&s;cover him unto them. Heaven is certainly a place of ac|tion, tho' the Divine employment there is an ever|la&s;ting re&s;t, as none of the inhabitants are wearied with their labour. <HI>The Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne</HI> performs an active part in that happy &s;itua|tion, <HI>and leads his people</HI> into &s;till more full <HI>fountains of joy.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. THE <HI>Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne</HI> wipes away all their reproaches that have been unju&s;tly ca&s;t upon them. In this pre&s;ent life reproaches, like tears to a fair countenance, may darken a fair character; may make innocence appear as it were in her mourning robes. <HI>David</HI> &s;ays, <HI>reproach had near broke his heart.</HI> Tho' an innocent per&s;on may comfort him&s;elf under reproach, that he is innocent, yet it is often to him that others are impo&s;ed upon, and his u&s;efulne&s;s in a great mea&s;ure marred. Tho' integrity will &s;tand the te&s;t and come off victorious, yet it often happens that a man's u&s;efulne&s;s is hin|dered by means of the&s;e unju&s;t reproaches.</P>
<P>IN heaven the&s;e reproaches are wiped away, and innocence made to appear in all its fair and beauti|ful charms. As the Almighty <HI>puts the tears of his people in his bottle,</HI> as the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> expre&s;&s;eth it, and remembers his children's reproaches, &s;o at la&s;t he
<PB N="123" REF="127">will wipe them away, to their everla&s;ting vindica|tion and eternal comfort. The &s;candalous tongue, that like a poi&s;oned arrow fixed in the reputation of the innocent, &s;hall be wrapt up in flames of fire, and the patient &s;ufferer &s;et free from its &s;candal. That obliquy that bore hard upon them in this life, God &s;hall throw into the bottomle&s;s pit, and every piece of unju&s;t &s;candal into <HI>the lake that burns with fire and brim&s;tone.</HI> The&s;e vipers that fixt in the cha|racter of the &s;aints, like that which fixt upon <HI>Paul</HI>'s hand, &s;hall be &s;haken off into everla&s;ting fire; yea the&s;e temptations that <HI>Satan</HI> hath often laid before the people of God, and urged their compliance with, and tempted them again to believe they did yield, &s;hall all of them be removed from their ac|count, and added to his own crimes. Evey blot &s;hall be wiped from their character, and they <HI>&s;hall appear before God without &s;pot or wrinkle, or any &s;uch thing.</HI></P>
<P>THE la&s;t thing in the method was to make &s;ome improvement.</P>
<P N="1">1. WE may learn that all the titles of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> are full of true &s;ignification. He is called <HI>the Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne,</HI> and the an&s;wers his title exactly. He was a &s;potle&s;s &s;in-offering, <HI>holy, harmle&s;s, undefiled, and &s;eparate from &s;inners; without guile, nor was &s;in found in his mouth.</HI> In this character he bore the puni&s;hment of our &s;in; and as the Pa&s;chal Lamb was a &s;acrifice, who&s;e blood &s;aved the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> from temporal judgments, &s;o the blood of <HI>the Lamb of God takes away the &s;in of the world,</HI> and delivers believers from &s;piritual and eternal death.&mdash;This title carries more in it than mere al|lu&s;ion; it al&s;o denotes his real fitne&s;s <HI>to &s;ave his peo|ple from their &s;ins:</HI> It &s;hews what character he bore when here, and &s;till &s;u&s;tains in his exalted &s;tate. It &s;hews that there was a real tran&s;lation of guilt upon him: This <HI>John</HI> intimates when he &s;ays, <HI>Be|hold
<PB N="124" REF="128">the Lamb of God, that taketh away the &s;in of the world!</HI> I know that &s;ome who have gained the ap|probation and attention of the fa&s;hionable world, alledge that guilt is per&s;onal, and cannot be im|puted to the innocent, and that vicarious puni&s;h|ment or atonement, is contrary to the goodne&s;s of God, which cannot make innocence &s;uffer: But as the&s;e of that per&s;ua&s;ion form a character to the De|ity after their own imagination, which is not to be found in &s;cripture; and conceive what he &s;hould be, but do not hold by his own de&s;cription of his cha|racter, it is no wonder the death of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> as an atonement is fooli&s;hne&s;s to them. Nothing is more evident from the &s;cripture, than the notion of vi|carious puni&s;hment:&mdash;<HI>He bore our &s;ins on his own body on the tree:&mdash;He was made &s;in for us, who knew no &s;in, that we might be made the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in him.</HI> We are not obliged to account to the&s;e monopolizers of rea&s;on, why the Deity made <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> &s;in, or made him &s;uffer for our &s;ins; but on|ly reply, that the whole &s;cripture is full of this doc|trine, and if it is wrong, they know whom to chal|lenge. Were there not a true &s;ignificancy in this title of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> all the Old Te&s;tament &s;aints have been in a great error, by tru&s;ting to un&s;igni|ficant types; and the apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> does not &s;eem to have under&s;tood them right, when he &s;ays, <HI>that all the fathers pa&s;&s;ed under the cloud, and they all pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;ea; that they all eat the &s;ame &s;piritual meat, and did all drink the &s;ame &s;piritual drink: For they drank of the rock that followed them, and that rock was Chri&s;t. Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> an&s;wers his type not merely for the &s;ake of form, but for the end of &s;alvation:&mdash; That both the Old and New Te&s;tament &s;aints might <HI>be freed from the cur&s;e of the law,</HI> and that <HI>a &s;ure ground of hope</HI> might be laid for all future believers.</P>
<P>WITHOUT con&s;idering <HI>Je&s;us</HI> as <HI>the &s;lain Lamb of God,</HI> and <HI>the atonement for our &s;ins,</HI> there can be no
<PB N="125" REF="129">relief for a guilty con&s;cience &s;everely pre&s;t with e|very rea&s;on of de&s;pair. Every &s;en&s;e of guilt and imperfection will pre&s;s hard upon the mind, and every view of the Divine character in its purity and perfection, will enforce the rea&s;ons of de&s;pair, till the &s;oul either totally de&s;pond, or &s;eek a refuge in future non-exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>IT is only a firm per&s;ua&s;ion of the truth of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s propitiation as <HI>the Lamb of God,</HI> with which the De|ity has declared his &s;atisfaction, that will &s;atisfy the con&s;cience of a &s;inner in his dying moments. And tho' many who have profe&s;&s;ed to di&s;credit this truth, and have founded the ground of their ac|ceptance upon their repentance and &s;incere endea|vours, have tried to make a &s;hift to die decently like philo&s;ophers and good men; yet notwith&s;tanding, as much often tran&s;pires to the world as to &s;hew the deceitfulne&s;s of their preten&s;ions, and how weak their hopes of future happine&s;s are.</P>
<P>IF the title of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> as <HI>the Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne,</HI> has &s;ignification, and there be truth in the atonement, then all who tru&s;t therein have certainty of eternal life and happine&s;s; but on the other hand, all at be&s;t is merely probable, a pure peradventure. God is indeed good, but he be&s;tows his goodne&s;s according <HI>to the good plea&s;ure of his will:</HI> This is the rule of the communication of his goodne&s;s and mercy to any. The adver&s;a|ries of the atonement dare not &s;ay that God nece&s;|&s;arily be&s;tows his goodne&s;s upon his creatures, o|therwi&s;e they cannot deprive devils of their own &s;hare; for they are his creatures as well as men. The way of enjoying mercy and goodne&s;s from God is only through the atonement of our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> In <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> his perfect character &s;hines with re&s;plendent glory: There every attribute of his na|ture is perfectly illu&s;trated: <HI>Mercy and truth meet together, righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace ki&s;s one another.</HI> The
<PB N="126" REF="130"><HI>wi&s;dom of men,</HI> that is <HI>fooli&s;hne&s;s with God,</HI> is ready to rai&s;e the laugh and irrefragable &s;mile, at &s;uppo&s;ing any variance among the Divine attri|butes; but notwith&s;tanding of their ridicule, and bla&s;phemous laugh, according to God's revealed character exhibited in the &s;criptures, his attributes cannot agree &s;hould he &s;ave men without an atone|ment: And all his di&s;pen&s;ations towards men &s;ince the beginning of the world, declare that &s;alvation to &s;inners was always intended through an atone|ment. Nothing could make this nece&s;&s;ary but the honour of the Divine character, and the glory of the attributes of God: For had the Deity intended to make &s;inners happy at the expence of his truth, ju&s;tice, and righteou&s;ne&s;s, there was no need for <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> at all. And it would be &s;till more un|accountable, to make a holy innocent per&s;on &s;uffer for no rea&s;on at all, but mere arbitary plea&s;ure, when neither love to men, nor any nece&s;&s;ity from his own character obliged him to it. Religion may here turn the ridicule upon her adver&s;aries, and a&s;k what was the rea&s;on that the Deity made <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> &s;uffer pain and agony of the &s;evere&s;t kind, when he had never &s;inned, nor given the lea&s;t offence to any:&mdash;When he had received the fulle&s;t te&s;timony of the Divine approbation twice from the excellent glory: <HI>This is my beloved &s;on, in whom I am well plea&s;ed.</HI> Is not this to &s;et the Divine at|tributes at variance: To exclude goodne&s;s and ju&s;tice, and repre&s;ent the Deity as a being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of wanton cruelty? Such a character as this, one may ju&s;tly form to a <HI>Nero,</HI> a <HI>Caligula,</HI> or a <HI>Domiti|an,</HI> who out of wantonne&s;s and arbitrary cruelty, ex|po&s;ed the primitive chri&s;tians to the &s;evere&s;t torture, when they could lay nothing to their charge that was blame-worthy.</P>
<P>To make <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> &s;uffer &s;uch pain and tor|ture when he had the mo&s;t evident approbation of
<PB N="127" REF="131">innocence, and had done nothing ami&s;s, is to give &s;uch a character of the Deity, as is only con&s;i&s;tent with the wor&s;t of beings. But when we con&s;ider <HI>the Lamb of God</HI> &s;uffering for the &s;ins of an elect world, that they may enjoy eternal life, and that all the attributes of God may be glorified in their hap|pine&s;s; a con&s;i&s;tent character given to the Almigh|ty: Here noble and excellent ends are propo&s;ed, and what otherwi&s;e was impo&s;&s;ible, is rendered po&s;|&s;ible; and what was incon&s;i&s;tent, made agreeable. No objections can be ju&s;tly brought again&s;t the real &s;ignificancy of our Redeemer's title; pride only finds them out. Human pride only cannot &s;ee the need and u&s;efulne&s;s of a &s;atisfaction. The a|tonement of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> &s;ets all men on the &s;ame footing in point of acceptance with God, which hath produced no little chagrin among the votaries of human excellence, and the devotees of &s;elf-de|pendence. The very great enmity that the world &s;hewed again&s;t <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> aro&s;e from the con&s;ider|ation that his life and doctrine, death and &s;ufferings, were a check upon the pride of men, and de&s;igned <HI>to &s;tain the pride of all glory.</HI> The proud and haughty <HI>Jews</HI> were offended at the meek and low|ly <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> becau&s;e he judged them to hell for their haughtine&s;s and pride. They under&s;tood his cha|racter a little, but did not love it: It was &s;o far as they under&s;tood it, they hated him. They found he was de&s;igned to put all men upon a level in point of acceptance with God, and intended to bring in publicans and harlots <HI>into the kingdom of God before them:</HI>&mdash;This &s;adly piqued the pride of Phari&s;ees, who imagined they were in better terms with the Deity than the re&s;t of the world, and much nigher the kingdom of God. The &s;ame rea&s;ons prevail with all the enemies of the atone|ment.&mdash;They are chagrined becau&s;e the atonement of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> &s;ets all their good virtues and moral
<PB N="128" REF="132">excellence a&s;ide, and brings them before God like other guilty men, who mu&s;t either be accepted of on account of the righteoune&s;s of another, or peri&s;h for ever.&mdash;</P>
<P>THE meanne&s;s of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> his outward character, made the <HI>Jews</HI> de&s;pi&s;e him, and the de&s;ign of his death made them bate him. His example was op|po&s;ite to the natural pride of the world, and the&s;e di&s;tinctions and differences that prevail &s;o much a|mong every &s;ect of religioni&s;ts, where every one has higher pretences to the favours of the Deity than ano|ther; whereas <HI>Je&s;us</HI> made all the difference to con|&s;i&s;t <HI>in bearing the cro&s;s, and &s;elf-denial.</HI> Human pride could not even admit his miracles to proceed from Divine power, becau&s;e he him&s;elf did not ad|mit of the&s;e differences:&mdash;So that when <HI>he made the blind to &s;ee, and the lame to walk, and rai&s;ed the dead, and cured all manner of di&s;ea&s;es,</HI> they &s;till &s;ay, <HI>Is not this the carpenter's &s;on?</HI> Becau&s;e he did not e&s;tabli&s;h the differences they were fond of, and loved to move in low life him&s;elf, they hated and de&s;pi&s;ed him.&mdash;His death, that was de&s;igned <HI>to take away the &s;ins of the world,</HI> they looked upon as the ju&s;t demerit of his arrogance, in making him&s;elf <HI>equal with God;</HI> when he was one of the lowe&s;t of men. After his re&s;urrection, when the fi&s;hers of <HI>Gallilee</HI> preached the doctrine of acceptance through his death, and &s;hewed <HI>there was no &s;alvation in any other;</HI> that it was only by <HI>believing in him</HI> that there was any difference among men in the &s;ight of God, it made them <HI>gna&s;h their teeth,</HI> and <HI>per&s;ecute them.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is the root of all the enmity of men at the atonement of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t:</HI> Becau&s;e it &s;ets all men in a level before God, in point of acceptance, they cannot &s;ee of what con&s;equence their virtue and excellence is, unle&s;s it procure the Divine fa|vour; they can a&s;&s;ign no valuable end it is good for. There is either &s;omething too high or too

<P>ALL the &s;cripture account of God will only af|ford rea&s;ons of de&s;pair, but &s;o far as he is reconciled
<PB N="141" REF="145"><HI>through the redemption that is in Je&s;us.</HI> His good|ne&s;s, as we ob&s;erved, can afford no true &s;atisfaction to any who are &s;en&s;ible of guilt and imperfection; nor can his expre&s;&s;ions of goodne&s;s to creatures that never offended him, give us any rea&s;on to ex|pect that he will be good to &s;uch as have offended, which is the whole force of all the arguments taken from his works. Tho' he by his goodne&s;s &s;atisfies the natural de&s;ires of every one of his creatures, as he is the upholder of the world, yet nothing from hence can be gathered of what he will do hereafter; nor can we certainly infer, that becau&s;e men ta&s;te of his temporal goodne&s;s, that he will reward them with eternal life hereafter:&mdash;On the contrary, we have rea&s;on to fear that he will ju&s;tly puni&s;h &s;uch as have abu&s;ed his goodne&s;s in this life, with mi&s;ery in the next. Revelation opens up a door of com|fort, in view of death, by revealing an atonement, with which God has declared him&s;elf <HI>well plea&s;ed;</HI> and as an evidence of the truth of this, <HI>has exalted Je&s;us,</HI> the author of that atonement, <HI>to the mid&s;t of his throne of glory.</HI>&mdash;And as our Saviour in this high &s;tate, and high character, is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all Divine fullne&s;s, &s;uited to the nature, and fuller than the de&s;ires of a finite &s;oul can be, and a&s;&s;uredly de|clared that believers &s;hall be &s;harers thereof, they have not only the &s;ure&s;t but the fulle&s;t hope. <HI>The Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne, &s;hall lead them into living fountains of waters.</HI> The meanne&s;s of their appearance here below, the reproaches they &s;uffered in this valley of tears, for following the Lamb, <HI>&s;hall be all wiped away.

<Q><BIBL><HI>REV. i. 18.</HI></BIBL>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE Apo&s;tle <HI>John,</HI> who was bani&s;hed into the i&s;le of <HI>Patmos,</HI> in the reign of the em|peror <HI>Domitian,</HI> for the te&s;timony of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> was eminently favoured of God with many bright di&s;coveries of his glory and goodne&s;s, and revelations of his will. This book is called, <HI>The Revelation of Je&s;us, that he &s;ignified by his an|gel to his &s;ervant John,</HI> becau&s;e it contains a pro|phecy of what <HI>Je&s;us</HI> was about to work in his church, by reforming her from antichri&s;tian &s;uper|&s;tition, and delivering her from that pre&s;ent per&s;e|cution which &s;he then laboured under.</P>
<P>THIS chapter contains the &s;ub&s;tance of a vi&s;ion that God gave unto the apo&s;tle, in which <HI>Je&s;us</HI> ap|peared unto him, and gave him a commi&s;&s;ion to <HI>write unto the &s;even churches of A&s;ia.</HI> The vi&s;ion contains a repre&s;entation of the&s;e churches under the figure of <HI>Candle&s;ticks,</HI> and <HI>Je&s;us</HI> the Lord <HI>walk|ing in the mid&s;t of them.</HI>&mdash;His appearance is ma|je&s;tic, &s;olemn and awful, &s;triking in the highe&s;t de|gree, and far too &s;plendid for human &s;ight. There is near the &s;ame de&s;cription of him mentioned in <HI>Ezekiel</HI>'s vi&s;ion, chapter 1&s;t, near the clo&s;e, which had the &s;ame effect upon the prophet that this had upon the apo&s;tle <HI>John.</HI></P>
<P>THE awful appearance of this Godlike per|&s;onage
<PB N="144" REF="148">was far too &s;triking for the apo&s;tle's &s;en&s;es to behold, and wrought upon him in &s;uch a degree, that through fear and a&s;toni&s;hment <HI>he fell to the ground.</HI> To comfort him in the mid&s;t of his fear, and remove the effect of his a&s;toni&s;hment, <HI>Je&s;us</HI> tells him who he was, to put him in mind of the de&s;ign of all his manife&s;tations, which was to quicken not to kill his people: <HI>I am he who liveth and was dead;</HI> and in view of &s;uch a work as he was now to be called unto, it was needful he &s;hould know who-employed him, and have encouragement for &s;uch an important ta&s;k.</P>
<P>THAT he might be able to endure this reve|lation, <HI>Je&s;us</HI> directs him through what medium to look, and puts him in mind of his <HI>death and re&s;ur|rection,</HI> as a per&s;pective thro' which he might be|hold the glory of God without confu&s;ion. The on|ly way to behold the glory of God, and enjoy com|munion with him, is thro' <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> as once <HI>a dead,</HI> but now <HI>a living</HI> Redeemer. <HI>No man can &s;ee God and live,</HI> but thro' him <HI>that was dead and is alive:</HI> If <HI>John</HI> could not behold the Mediator in his glory without <HI>falling to the ground,</HI> &s;urely no man can be|hold his perfect maje&s;ty <HI>and live.</HI> It is thro' <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> as <HI>the propitiation for our &s;ins,</HI> that we can <HI>ap|proach unto God;</HI> he hath <HI>con&s;ecrated a new and li|ving way through the vail of his fle&s;h.</HI> Our pre&s;ent views of God mu&s;t be directed thro' <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> his &s;on, <HI>who liveth and was dead.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>HERE I &s;hall con&s;ider the death of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as a medium or gla&s;s, to carry forward our views to God, or as the means of our enjoying communion with him.

<P N="1">1. IT is through the death of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> the rays of Divine light and grace &s;hine upon guilty men. None of the benign beams of Divine love could have &s;hone upon the church, unle&s;s <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> had died to make it con&s;i&s;tent with the attributes of God, thus to expre&s;s his goodne&s;s to a guilty world. <HI>Clouds and darkne&s;s are round about him:</HI> His pure Maje&s;ty is darkne&s;s to the minds of blinded &s;inners, and no man could have beheld his Maje&s;ty &s;ince &s;in came into the world, unle&s;s <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> by his death and &s;uffering, had taken away that vengeful a&s;pect it appeared in again&s;t the guilty. But thro' the death of our Redeemer this &s;plendour of Divine Maje&s;ty, is like <HI>a day &s;pring from on high:</HI> That dreadful part of his character, tho' not altered in it&s;elf, appears mild and propitious, as it &s;hines thro' God in our nature.</P>
<P>OUR Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> by <HI>tabernacling among men,</HI> in their nature, <HI>and &s;uffering for their &s;in,</HI> hath made it appear that there is <HI>good will to men.</HI> A guilty world could &s;ee no te&s;timonies of his good will, as to future happine&s;s, by all the di&s;coveries of natural &s;cience; all things on that head were only conjectural, till the go&s;pel revealed them. By &s;in there was a judicial blindne&s;s upon men as an effect of the cur&s;e; even light it&s;elf, to them by nature, is darkne&s;s <HI>i. e.</HI> the light of Divine truth. The &s;plendour of the Divine character is too glaring for man's infected mental &s;ight to behold, without a proper medium. The very &s;en&s;e of the Divine cha|racter made our fir&s;t parents flee from his pre&s;ence, <HI>and hide them&s;elves among the trees of the garden.</HI> It is through <HI>Je&s;us</HI> only we come <HI>to know the will of God for our &s;alvation,</HI> and &s;ee a po&s;&s;ibility of any of the guilty race of <HI>Adam</HI> enjoying communion with him. <HI>What was hid for ages and generations, is now made manife&s;t through the death of the &s;on of God.</HI> The fir&s;t views of peace and happine&s;s after the fall,
<PB N="146" REF="150">were conveyed to our fir&s;t parents through a pro|mi&s;e of a crucified Saviour, <HI>Gen.</HI> iii. 15. <HI>The &s;eed of the woman &s;hall brui&s;e the head of the &s;erpent.</HI> The thoughts of God's being reconciled to men could never have entered into the heart of man; his be&s;t di&s;coveries would have been for ever conjecture.&mdash;But through this glorious medium, God has &s;et <HI>eternal life</HI> before our eyes.</P>
<P>EVEN the natural con&s;cience when it reflects upon its own guiltine&s;s, and the purity of the na|ture of God, cannot conceive of a po&s;&s;ibility of hap|pine&s;s, but through &s;ome mean that makes it con|&s;i&s;tent with his nature to be&s;tow it. We cannot have any ju&s;t notions of reconciliation with God, without con&s;idering if it is con&s;i&s;tent with his cha|racter to be reconciled: And without &s;ome method above the reach of human invention, this cannot be conceived. The heathens wandered far a&s;tray in their conceits about placating the Deity, and were far di&s;tant from enjoying communion with him. Their minds could not conceive how true communion with the Deity could be enjoyed, and therefore they conceived of their gods as removed at a great di&s;tance from them, and &s;o feared, but did not love them. The true knowledge of happine&s;s and communion with God, is only rightly attain|ed unto through a view of the death and atonement of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t:</HI> For thereby God appears favour|able to men, and on account thereof has declared, <HI>he is well plea&s;ed.</HI> The publication of the death and &s;atisfaction of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as a &s;ub&s;titute for &s;inners, and of God's acceptation of his performance in that capacity, affords us a view of God that is amiable and delightful. For whatever appeared vengeful-like in his character, is rendered amiable through this means of his own devi&s;ing. The pre&s;ence of God will be awful, but never amiable to a guilty
<PB N="147" REF="151">mind, till once it &s;ees him through the death of his well-beloved &s;on.</P>
<P>THERE will be a con&s;tant antipathy between the mind and what is pure and holy, until it per|ceives a po&s;&s;ibility of holine&s;s, and &s;ees it to be its intere&s;t. Guilt begets fear, and fear antipathy, and both produce impurity: For he who has a dread of God's vengeance, will naturally have an antipathy at his pre&s;ence, which will cau&s;e the greate&s;t moral pain in the &s;oul; and when the &s;oul flies from God, it al&s;o flies from holine&s;s: For he is the &s;ource of all purity and perfection. All natu|ral oppo&s;ites have le&s;s or more antipathy at one a|nother, and nothing is more oppo&s;ite than the ho|line&s;s of God, and our guilty impure con&s;ciences. The more we con&s;ider our oppo&s;ition to God, the greater will our aver&s;ion be to communion with him. Through the death of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> we have a pro&s;pect of reconciliation, and the removing of the oppo&s;ition between God and guilty &s;inners: <HI>For them that were far off, are brought near by the blood of Je&s;us.</HI> The death of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is like a gla&s;s through which the Deity &s;hines propitious to a guilty world: This is the ble&s;&s;ed medium through which he communicates his favour to the objects of his love: This the procuring cau&s;e of all the di&s;|plays of Divine favour in all the various manife&s;ta|tions thereof:&mdash;This al&s;o the rea&s;on why men <HI>live to the prai&s;e of the glory of God:</HI> For <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> by his death purcha&s;ed every Divine gift nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;po&s;e the minds of chri&s;tians to delight in the Divine law. As freedom from the guilt of &s;in is derived from the death of <HI>Je&s;us:</HI> So it is the &s;ource from which Divine energy flows to &s;upport their &s;ouls in life, in the mid&s;t of every trial in this mor|tal &s;tate.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE death of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> may be con&s;idered ac|tively, as having a powerful influence, not only in
<PB N="148" REF="152">making new di&s;coveries to men, but in effecting the means whereby they can di&s;cern them. It hath procured that influence and power, which opens the <HI>eyes of our blinded under&s;tanding,</HI> and cau&s;eth men to di&s;cern &s;piritual objects in another manner. The&s;e prejudices that attend our fallen corrupt &s;tate, are powerfully removed by the efficacy of the death of our Redeemer. The death of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is a truth full of active power, and carries along with it &s;uch evidence, as overcomes the re&s;i&s;tance of men's natural unbelief. It is indeed only a pa&s;&s;ive truth &s;o far to many; but to tho&s;e who are its true objects, it is a truth that gives life, a quickening truth. The darkened mind that was ready <HI>to &s;leep the &s;leep of death,</HI> is thereby enlightened, and &s;ends comfortable intimations of peace and pardon into the con&s;cience: For the very language of this truth to the &s;oul is, <HI>that it &s;hall not die, but live, and di&s;|cover the works of the Lord.</HI> It is not only a reme|dy again&s;t guilt, becau&s;e accepted of by <HI>Jehovah,</HI> but a truth that operates upon the &s;oul, as a beam of quickening light from the &s;un of righte|ou&s;ne&s;s. It is a truth that nouri&s;hes the &s;oul of a chri&s;tian, and enables it to exert it&s;elf in all its par|ticular powers. The knowledge of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s death, as a ran&s;om-price for man's redemption, revives the&s;e powers of the mind to the true exerci&s;e of love and joy, that were depre&s;&s;ed under fear, uncertainty and remor&s;e.</P>
<P>CONSCIENCE will &s;oon tell men when they are offenders, and &s;in no &s;ooner touches this moral &s;en&s;e, but the thoughts of God are painful; from whence ari&s;es remor&s;e, which when long endured begets &s;tupidity, which no human rea&s;oning can remove, till God di&s;covers him&s;elf to the con&s;cience, either as a God of vengeance or mercy. As to the fir&s;t of the&s;e di&s;coveries, the fir&s;t effect it has upon the &s;oul, is the &s;tirring up the old remor&s;e, fear and appre|hen&s;ion;
<PB N="149" REF="153">but the latter quickens it in the way of healing it. The mercy of God through the death of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> is a quickening and reviving truth. That word of life which reveals <HI>Chri&s;t crucified</HI> to a guilty &s;oul, heals that pain and remor&s;e, which the apprehen&s;ions of God's di&s;plea&s;ure and indignation rai&s;es in the &s;oul: <HI>He &s;ent his word and healed them,</HI> P&s;al. cvii. 20.</P>
<P>THE views of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> crucified, and of God re|conciled in him to guilty &s;inners, draw forth the va|rious exertions of the &s;oul to their proper objects: So fear attended with joy, reverence joined with faith, and confidence and love of God joined with hatered at &s;in, are all exerci&s;ed with true propriety. The death of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> as an active cau&s;e, carries for|ward our views towards God and communion with him: For it is the nouri&s;hment of the &s;oul in all its exerci&s;es, and acts of religion and devotion: <HI>My fle&s;h is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed,</HI> are the words of the Redeemer him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THE death of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> is not merely a pa&s;|&s;ive medium thro' which we may &s;ee God revealed, but a powerful enlightening truth, that gives <HI>light to the blinded under&s;tanding.</HI> The evidence thereof, and the grace and favour of God, which con&s;tantly attends it, gives power to the &s;oul to &s;ee &s;piritual objects, as well as make the object po&s;&s;ible to be viewed. Hereby the object is both brought near, and the &s;ight carried forward to the object. There are two things peculiar in the mi&s;ery of a fallen &s;tate: The true object of our happine&s;s removed far hence, and at a di&s;tance from us: The want of power to di&s;cern the object when near. <HI>Chri&s;t cru|cified</HI> is a remedy for both the&s;e evils: For by his death he has made God our friend, and brought the Divine attributes and perfections, within the reach of our faith, as harmonizing in the &s;alvation of guilty &s;inners, and by the &s;ame hath purcha&s;ed
<PB N="150" REF="154">&s;trength to &s;uch as were ungodly: <HI>For when we were without &s;trength, in due time Chri&s;t died for the ungodly,</HI> Rom. v. 6. The habits and exerci&s;es of all true Divine &s;entiments, depend upon the death of our Redeemer: So that as he hath brought the Deity nearer to us, he hath al&s;o given us power and &s;trength whereby we are enabled to enjoy com|munion with him.</P>
<P N="3">3. IT is by contemplating <HI>Chri&s;t crucified,</HI> that our minds can be &s;tedfa&s;t in viewing the Divine attributes. It is in him as the atonement, <HI>that mer|cy and truth meet together, righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace ki&s;s one another.</HI> When the believer's mind contem|plates the death of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as the medium through which God di&s;plays his attributes in man's &s;alva|tion, every view of the Divine character therein is delightful, and gives joy to the &s;oul. To behold the Divine character thro' the &s;ufferings of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> is a plea&s;ing not a confounding &s;ight. The &s;oul can endure the di&s;covery: For the radiance of the Divinity &s;hines with love and meekne&s;s thro' the fle&s;h of the &s;on of the Highe&s;t. The Deity as it were becomes familiar to a chri&s;tian, by di&s;play|ing its &s;weetne&s;s thro' his own nature: Hereby he is enabled to look more &s;tedfa&s;tly upon the charac|ter of God, as expre&s;&s;ed in him <HI>who is bone of his bone, and fle&s;h of his fle&s;h:</HI> And is made to &s;ay, <HI>We beheld his glory, the glory of the only begotten &s;on of God, full of grace and truth,</HI> John i. 14. The true chri&s;tian can with ea&s;e and delight, contemplate the character of a Deity thro' his well-beloved &s;on our <HI>crucified Redeemer.</HI> It is there that ju&s;tice as it were &s;miles with affability upon &s;uch as were guilty, and there that con&s;cience can contemplate that glorious part of the Divine character, without confu&s;ion and horror. When there is &s;ome proportion between the radiance of the object, and the &s;trength given to the mental vi&s;ive faculty, that horror that ari&s;es
<PB N="151" REF="155">from the &s;uperior glare of a very &s;triking object is removed.</P>
<P>A FULL glance of the Divine Maje&s;ty would confound all men at once, con&s;idering the imper|fection of their faculties. For no man could <HI>&s;ee God's face and live,</HI> and there could be no commu|nion intimately had with him in this pre&s;ent im|perfect &s;tate: But thro' the death of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> every true believer enjoys a &s;tedfa&s;t view of the Divine character: Hence, &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, <HI>We all as in a gla&s;s beholding the glory of God, are changed into the &s;ame image, from glory to glory,</HI> 2 Cor. iii. 18. The &s;ame Apo&s;tle, <HI>Heb.</HI> xii. 2. points out the way of our enjoying communion with God: <HI>Let us run with patience the race that is &s;et before us, looking un|to Je&s;us the author and fini&s;her of</HI> our <HI>faith; who, for the joy that was &s;et before him, endured the cro&s;s, and de&s;pi&s;ed the &s;hame, and is now &s;et down on the right|hand of the throne of God.</HI> The &s;ame Apo&s;tle &s;aw &s;o much glory in <HI>the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t,</HI> that he deter|mined to <HI>know,</HI> and to <HI>glory in nothing el&s;e,</HI> Gal. vi. 14. It was thro' this he beheld <HI>God as reconciled,</HI> and could with &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s dwell upon the &s;ubject. It is by fixing the eyes of the mind upon a <HI>crucified Je&s;us,</HI> that we can contemplate the nature of God with &s;atisfaction: <HI>For in him he is well plea&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P>To con&s;ider the holine&s;s of God, and our own impurity &s;imply, is a thought that no man could long endure: To view his ju&s;tice and our guilt, is a con&s;ideration we could not abide. But in <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t crucified,</HI> we may behold him as a God <HI>pur|ging us from our &s;ins, by the blood of his own well-be|loved &s;on,</HI> and taking away all our guilt for the &s;ake of his <HI>perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s:</HI> Therefore our minds can thro' <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t crucified,</HI> view the attributes of God with great plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P N="4">4. IT is by the death of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> that the intima|tions of peace and pardon are made to the con|&s;cience:
<PB N="152" REF="156">So the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>He is our peace, that hath made us one through his cro&s;s,</HI> Eph. ii. 14, 15, 16. That &s;atisfaction of mind, and peace of con&s;cience, which may ju&s;tly be called &s;elf-enjoyment, is con|veyed to us thro' the blood of <HI>Je&s;us.</HI> This may be called communion with God in the way of peace: For till an intimation of pardon of &s;in be intimate to con&s;cience, the &s;oul cannot enjoy the benefit of comfortable communion. When a believer con|&s;iders the account the Divine Te&s;timony gives of the rea&s;on, cau&s;e, and effects of the &s;uffering of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> he perceives a la&s;ting ground of reconcilia|tion between God and his &s;oul: And when con|&s;cience is thus informed by the Divine record, it enjoys ea&s;e and tranquility. The view of God that is pre&s;ented to con&s;cience, in the &s;uffering of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> is that he is a friend; and con&s;cience improves the friend&s;hip, by concluding, that <HI>there is peace with God thro' our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and <HI>acce&s;s to him with boldne&s;s thro' the blood of his &s;on.</HI></P>
<P>THE death of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is a te&s;timony of God's mo&s;t gracious de&s;igns to men: It is an evidence of his good-will, and his purpo&s;es of peace to the guilty: <HI>It &s;peaks better things than the blood of Abel.</HI> It is the channel of all the&s;e delightful di&s;coveries <HI>of life and immortality, which the go&s;pel brings to light:</HI> It is the gla&s;s the mind views them thro', and by the di&s;|coveries made thereby, all fears and perplexi|ties of mind are di&s;pelled. Every view of the Di|vine character, purpo&s;es and de&s;igns, which &s;hine thro' the &s;ufferings of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> &s;peak peace to the &s;oul: <HI>For if he &s;pared not his own &s;on, but gave him up to the death for us all, how much more will be not freely give us all things?</HI> Rom. viii. 32. Whoever by a true faith con&s;iders the death of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> cannot but &s;ee that there is peace to him: For God cannot demand two &s;atisfactions in ju&s;tice, one from the &s;urety, and another from the principle: And if he
<PB N="153" REF="157">was &s;atisfied with what his own &s;on hath done, as the &s;urety of his people, he is al&s;o gracious to them for his &s;ake. Every one who under&s;tands the death of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as a ran&s;om-price for their iniquities, mu&s;t be &s;atisfied in their own mind, with re&s;pect to God's good-will to them, as the object of that redemption: <HI>If ye &s;eek me, let the&s;e go their way,</HI> &s;ays the Redeem|er, <HI>John</HI> xviii. 8.</P>
<P>PEACE of con&s;cience will obtain when chri&s;ti|ans have ju&s;t apprehen&s;ions of the death of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</HI> but whenever any per&s;on views God thro' any other medium, he will appear dreadful: His Maje&s;ty will confound their &s;ouls, and the mo&s;t fa|vourable conjectures they can have of him through any other channel, will be far from giving &s;olid peace to the mind. The very thoughts of his holy nature will be dreadful, however &s;trictly a man lead his life; for he cannot live &s;o uprightly as the law of God requires, and even the old grievance of o|riginal &s;in will recur upon him, and marr his tran|quility. The con&s;cience will be &s;atisfied with no &s;pecious pretences, nor be rightly quieted with any other notions of peace, but peace thro' the blood of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> Every remembrance of God will give trou|ble, but the remembrance of him thro' <HI>Je&s;us. A|&s;aph</HI> was troubled at remembering God, till he thought upon him as <HI>a Saviour, redeeming his people,</HI> P&s;al. lxxvii. 3. All mediums we can view God thro', will lead us to fearful inferences, but the <HI>blood of Je&s;us:</HI> But through his death the &s;oul will draw a favourable conclu&s;ion: <HI>I &s;hall not die, but live, and di&s;cover the works of the Lord,</HI> P&s;al. cxviii. 17. Thro' this ble&s;&s;ed channel con&s;cience enjoys peace, and &s;ees cau&s;e with <HI>boldne&s;s to approach unto God.</HI> Heb. x. 19. <HI>Having therefore boldne&s;s to enter into the holie&s;t by the blood of Je&s;us, by a new and living way, which he hath con&s;ecrated for us, through the vail, that is to &s;ay, his fle&s;h.</HI></P>

<P>Head 2d. To con&s;ider the exaltation of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> as the channel through which our com|munion with God may be carried forward to greater perfection, <HI>I am he that liveth,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE exaltation of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is the channel thro' which the legacies of his death are applied to his people. As he merited the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings by his death, which are nece&s;&s;ary to make his children happy and holy, &s;o he <HI>ever liveth</HI> to execute his own Te&s;ta|ment, and to &s;ee a ju&s;t application of all the bene|fits of his death to the objects thereof. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> be|fore his death left &s;undry excellent legacies to his church and people: <HI>Peace with God, joy and con&s;ola|tion,</HI> were &s;pecial legacies he bequeathed to them, and promi&s;ed when he was exalted to be&s;tow them upon his church: <HI>My peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you; not as the world giveth, give I unto you. I will &s;end you the comforter, and he &s;hall abide with you for ever.</HI> It is by a ju&s;t con&s;ideration of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as an exalted Saviour, and acting faith upon him, that the chri&s;tian enjoys communion with God in the way of hope. Communion with God in the way of hope, con&s;i&s;ts in the &s;oul's entertaining it&s;elf with the promi&s;ed <HI>good things to come:</HI> This com|munion is carried forward to perfection thro' <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> the exalted head of his church. When the &s;oul re|flects upon what God has promi&s;ed to be&s;tow, it entertains it&s;elf with his te&s;timony, and patiently hopes till the appointed time come, when the good things promi&s;ed &s;hall be be&s;towed. But when to the promi&s;e it&s;elf, this glorious fact of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s ex|altation is added, and when this is con&s;idered as the <HI>fir&s;t fruits</HI> of their exaltation, it renders this com|munion of hope more perfect.</P>
<P>THESE Divine legacies, which our Mediator left to his church, are the &s;ub&s;tance of our com|munion with God here below; when we enjoy the&s;e we have communion with him in his grace.
<PB N="155" REF="159">But this enjoyment depends much upon the exal|tation of the Mediator: For they depended upon his <HI>going away,</HI> and <HI>a&s;cending into heaven,</HI> and the con&s;tant enjoyment of them to his church depends upon the &s;ame cau&s;e. He is the con&s;tant executor of his own Te&s;tament. Without being certain of <HI>Chri&s;t's living for ever at the right-hand of God,</HI> we cannot be certain that tho&s;e benefits &s;hall be for ever conferred: But when we are certain of this, we are &s;ure that our communion with God &s;hall for ever be carried forward to perfection. <HI>Becau&s;e he lives, her children &s;hall live al&s;o.</HI> If <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was not exalted, we could have no communion with God in the way of mercy, nor any certainty of pardon of our iniquities. We could not be &s;ure that his death, as a &s;acrifice, was accepted of for &s;inners, un|le&s;s he had been exalted and glorified; nor could any one conceive who &s;hould execute his Te&s;tament, if he had not been exalted.</P>
<P>THROUGH the exaltation of our Mediator, we can &s;ee a certainty of the application of all the be|nefits of his death: For as <HI>he died for our &s;ins, &s;o he ro&s;e again for our ju&s;tification,</HI> and continual com|fort.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE exaltation of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> carries forward our views, and confirms our per&s;ua&s;ion of a more im|mediate &s;ight of God in another life. By the death of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> we &s;ee the Divine goodne&s;s coming down from heaven to men; by his exaltation, we behold men brought up to heaven to God. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> told his di&s;ciples before he left this world, for their comfort, <HI>That he went to prepare a place for them.</HI> And as they are certain that he has <HI>prepared a place for them,</HI> and taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it in their room; they are al&s;o certain, <HI>that in due time,</HI> they &s;hall thro' him, <HI>come to the enjoyment thereof,</HI> and fill up <HI>their own room</HI> in glory. Every view that the true chri&s;tian obtains of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> as <HI>exalted at God's
<PB N="156" REF="160">right-hand,</HI> by means of the Divine record, encrea&s;es his per&s;ua&s;ion, that he &s;hall enjoy that communion for him&s;elf at la&s;t, which he now hopes for, and which his Redeemer has &s;ecured for him in heaven.</P>
<P>IT is thro' that repre&s;entation which <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> makes of believers, in his &s;tate of exaltation, that they in this pre&s;ent life &s;ee a po&s;&s;ibility and certainty of enjoying the full and free immunities of that royal place, where <HI>the King eternal reigneth for evermore.</HI> Like as a powerful and &s;incere friend at court pro|cures a place for his friend and relation, &s;o <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> as the chri&s;tian's be&s;t friend, has <HI>prepared a place for all his people,</HI> and all the certainty they have of en|joying this happine&s;s is thro' him; they only can &s;ee their own privilege thro' his intere&s;t.</P>
<P>BELIEVERS having the &s;incere per&s;ua&s;ion that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> hath <HI>prepared a place for them at God's right-hand in heaven,</HI> and <HI>liveth for ever</HI> as their Mediator to &s;ecure their place, behold as in a mirrour the cer|tainty of their coming to glory, when all the for|malities of the New Covenant are fulfilled: That as <HI>their head and hu&s;band</HI> is now exalted, &s;o in <HI>due time</HI> they &s;hall al&s;o be exalted together with him, and join <HI>the general a&s;&s;embly and church of the fir&s;t|born.</HI> As we behold the&s;e things which are invi|&s;ible to the naked eye by the help of mediums; &s;o by beholding the exaltation of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> by faith, we &s;ee the&s;e Divine ble&s;&s;ings which &s;hall be be&s;towed upon the &s;aints in glory. Without taking into our view the exaltation of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> we cannot have the lea&s;t hope of coming to heaven. Had not <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> as the &s;urety of his people, been <HI>rai&s;ed from the dead,</HI> and <HI>exalted to the father's right-hand,</HI> no man could have had the lea&s;t pro&s;pect of happine&s;s, becau&s;e they would have had no evidence of ju&s;tice being &s;atisfied. But &s;eeing our Redeemer triumph|ed over death, and was joyfully received into hea|ven, after he had deba&s;ed him&s;elf &s;o low by the
<PB N="157" REF="161">&s;uffering of death, it is an evidence of the Divine Maje&s;ty being &s;atisfied with what he had done.</P>
<P>WHEN this exaltation of our Saviour is reveal|ed to our mind as a truth, as it really is in Divine revelation, through this truth the believer &s;ees a more perfect communion with God remaining for him, when he is exalted, as his Saviour hath pro|mi&s;ed unto him: <HI>I will come again and receive you to my&s;elf, that where I am, ye may be al&s;o, to behold my glory.</HI> We have no evidence from &s;cripture, of any other exaltation of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> but in the capacity of our Mediator; and that glory which he received in that capacity, he received not for him&s;elf, but for his &s;piritual &s;eed: And in the capacity of a Mediator, all the honour which he requires, is to have the power and plea&s;ure of making men hap|py, by bringing them nearer to God. As this is the very end of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s exaltation, to bring his <HI>&s;aints nearer unto God;</HI> &s;o when they by faith con|template his exaltation, they &s;ee a more perfect en|joyment of God prepared for them. The human nature of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> exalted at the Father's right-hand, is a pledge of all the members of his my&s;tical body enjoying the &s;ame exaltation. Something like this is implied in our Lord's promi&s;e to his di&s;ciples, Matth. xix. 28. <HI>Ye are they who have continued with me in my temptations, and I appoint unto you a king|dom, as my Father hath appointed unto me, that ye may &s;it on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. BY the exaltation of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> we come to &s;ee what that communion is which &s;aints &s;hall enjoy with God hereafter in heaven. It is &s;uch a com|munion as children have with their father, a com|munion with God in holine&s;s and purity. It is in Scripture called, <HI>an inheritance: An inheritance in|corruptible, undefiled, and which fadeth not away. Chri&s;t</HI> is the <HI>fir&s;t-born,</HI> and <HI>fir&s;t heir</HI> of this inheri|tance; and what he inherits is communion and in|timacy
<PB N="158" REF="162">with the Father in love and favour. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is by the Apo&s;tle &s;aid to make believers <HI>heirs of God,</HI> and they are called <HI>joint heirs with Chri&s;t:</HI> So their communion with God, is of the &s;ame nature with that which <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> enjoys as mediator. If we once under&s;tand what that communion is which our Re|deemer, in his &s;tate of exaltation enjoys, we may ea&s;ily learn what that is which his &s;aints &s;hall enjoy. Whatever notions men have of communion with God in a future life, that are not connected with <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s exaltation, are mere fancies, and dreams of men's imagination. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in his exalted &s;tate is ad|vanced to the highe&s;t honour and glory, and the greate&s;t degree of favour and intimacy. He &s;its on the <HI>Father's right-hand,</HI> as an evidence of his great love and delight in him, and all true believers are admitted at la&s;t to &s;it with <HI>Chri&s;t at God's right-hand.</HI></P>
<P>WE cannot but conceive from the Scripture ac|count of our Lord's exaltation, but his human na|ture in a &s;tate of glory does enjoy a very perfect vi&s;ion of the nature and attributes of God, and of all his plans and purpo&s;es. Tho' our Lord's body and &s;oul are not infinite, as being bounded and circum&s;cribed, as to place, yet being glorified, are capable of beholding the brighte&s;t di&s;plays of the Divine radiance; and tho' it is more the union of that nature to the Divinity, that enables it to behold all the &s;hining &s;plendour of Deity and the God-head, than merely its exaltation into heaven, yet it is the exaltation of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> that brought his hu|man nature into that place where the fulle&s;t di&s;|coveries of Divine glory are made. Tho' the ca|pacity of our natures, as individuated, is not able to behold &s;o much of the Divine &s;plendour, as the human nature of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> yet by virtue of men's relation to him as their head, they &s;hall be able to
<PB N="159" REF="163">behold the &s;ame glory, tho' not &s;o fully and per|fectly.</P>
<P>WHATEVER we can conceive our Redeemer be|holds of the Divine attributes, he &s;hall make his people &s;ee in a &s;tate of glory, tho' their capacity will not be &s;o perfectly able to receive &s;o much as his. Yet that communion which all the &s;aints will enjoy, will be the &s;ame with that which <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> en|joys; the &s;ame way that the members may be &s;aid to have the &s;ame communion as the head. Tho&s;e who would have a true knowledge of that com|munion which glorified &s;aints enjoy with God, mu&s;t look thro' the Scripture account of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s exalta|tion, and there they will find it: <HI>For as the head is, &s;o &s;hall al&s;o his members be. Chri&s;t</HI> in his exalted &s;tate, enjoys mutual love and friend&s;hip with the Father; and the &s;um of all the communion the &s;aints can expect in heaven is, to give and receive mutual returns of love, in the immediate pre&s;ence of God. This privilege the &s;aints do enjoy thro' <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> as by him they are admitted into the Divine pre&s;ence, and for his &s;ake are made par|takers of this communion. Thro' him they enjoy a view of the Divine perfections, and are made &s;harers of the Divine love; and it is only as far as they under&s;tand the nature of his exaltation, that they have &s;uitable views of what communion with God in heaven is.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE exaltation of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> affords us a view of what the &s;aints' communion among them|&s;elves &s;hall be. It will chiefly con&s;i&s;t in beholding the &s;ame glorious object, viz. <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is exalted for that purpo&s;e,</HI> that all the faithful may for ever admire him. The Apo&s;tle affirms this to be the common privilege of chri&s;tians: <HI>We &s;ee Je&s;us crowned with glory and honour.</HI> Mutual enjoyment with one another in the &s;ame privileges, is account|ed communion among men: And mutual enjoy|ment
<PB N="160" REF="164">of the privilege of <HI>beholding the glory of God in the face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> may be called the com|munion of &s;aints in the other life. When all their eyes are fixed upon the &s;ame object, and their views and exerci&s;e the &s;ame, they mu&s;t certainly have the mo&s;t intimate communion among them&s;elves. Thus it is that the exaltation of our Redeemer carries forward our views to God, as the very center of that communion which glorified &s;aints enjoy among them&s;elves. The glory of Deity, which good men will ever behold, will &s;hine thro' an exalted Saviour, &s;o that their contemplation of exalted <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> will make all their &s;ouls meet in him as a center. The more they enjoy of communion with God through him, the more &s;hall they be united among them|&s;elves, and have a fuller communion.</P>
<P>BUT I mu&s;t now proceed to make &s;ome im|provement of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P N="1">1. HENCE &s;ee the duty of communicants at the table of the Lord: It is to look to <HI>Je&s;us</HI> as he <HI>that was dead and is now alive.</HI> Here you may &s;ee a plea for pardon of &s;in, a foundation for peace; a gla&s;s to look into the world thro'. Here you may &s;ee a powerful cau&s;e to pre&s;erve your &s;ouls from death, and in&s;ure eternal life to you, when this life is ended. As your Lord <HI>who died for you, liveth for evermore,</HI> &s;o <HI>ye &s;hall live al&s;o:</HI> He is in heaven for your &s;ake, and for your happine&s;s: He went <HI>to pre|pare a place for you.</HI> What you now <HI>&s;ee by faith,</HI> as it were at a di&s;tance, you &s;hall afterwards behold immediately and di&s;tinctly.</P>
<P>CHRIST <HI>lives for evermore,</HI> as <HI>the head of his church, which is his body;</HI> and all believers, as his members, <HI>&s;hall live with him for ever in glory.</HI> It is your pre&s;ent duty to have your faith exerci&s;ed upon him now, and to depend upon him &s;tedfa&s;tly, that you may come to a better under&s;tanding of what &s;hall be your employment, when your communion
<PB N="161" REF="165">with him &s;hall be more perfect. By contemplating the character of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> expre&s;&s;ed in the Di|vine record, you &s;hall <HI>&s;ee God manife&s;ted in the fle&s;h,</HI> which is the delight of glorified &s;aints, and the ad|miration of angels: <HI>For the&s;e things the angels de|&s;ire to look into.</HI> There is no po&s;&s;ibility of &s;eeing God aright, <HI>but in the face of Je&s;us;</HI> no hope of mer|cy from him, but in <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>WHATEVER notions you may have of God will be confounding, but not comforting, unle&s;s you view him as <HI>reconciled by the death of his &s;on:</HI> For who&s;e righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;ake, he has declared him|&s;elf <HI>well plea&s;ed.</HI> In <HI>the face of his anointed,</HI> the guil|ty and condemned may read pardon and forgive|ne&s;s, the weak &s;ee &s;trength, the unholy purity and &s;anctification. Communicants may here <HI>&s;ee the land that is afar off,</HI> and their own right to po&s;&s;e&s;s it: The beholding king <HI>Je&s;us</HI> in his beauty, affords them this di&s;covery. Thro' him they &s;ee their own right to <HI>glory, honour, and immortality.</HI></P>
<P>HERE they have, as it were, a draught in mini|ature of all that glory and bli&s;s that con&s;titutes heaven, and makes up eternal happine&s;s. This <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> which our text calls us to behold, is only &s;een in a Divine Te&s;timony. You have no rea&s;on to ex|pect any other but a rational view of him: For faith is nothing but the &s;ublime&s;t rea&s;on. It is the &s;oul upon &s;ufficient evidence, embracing the truth of the Divine character, manife&s;ted thro' the Son of God. Many mi&s;take in thinking, that what reve|lation calls grace and faith, is different from rea|&s;on; but if you con&s;ider this &s;ubject right, you will find that grace, faith, or whatever you plea&s;e to call them, are no more but rea&s;on rightly directed, or &s;ublime rationality.</P>
<P>THE phra&s;es in Scripture, <HI>Behold! look! &s;ee, &amp;c.</HI> when applied to <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> or any moral or Di|vine object, mean no more but rightly to under|&s;tand
<PB N="162" REF="166">them, &s;o as to believe them. Enthu&s;ia&s;ts of different denominations have afforded matter of much &s;candal to religion, by taking images of ano|ther &s;ort into the notion of looking unto <HI>Je&s;us.</HI> They often allow their imaginations to make an <HI>image, and fall down and wor&s;hip it.</HI> This is only mental idolatry. The repre&s;entation of ab&s;ent pictures to the imagination, will never help men to believe matters of fact expre&s;&s;ed in a Te&s;timony. The ob|jects of faith are moral and rational, and cannot be reduced into any other form, but as facts and &s;enti|ments. The force of imagination may help devo|tion, but cannot give any a&s;&s;i&s;tance to faith, which is rationally directed by the authority of God in his word. And this devotion, which is the effect of fancy and imagination, whatever heights it may a&s;cend to, leaves &s;till the devotee an unbeliever.</P>
<P>THE declaration of Divine truth in revelation, is the object of judgment, or moral feeling, not of imagination and fancy, which rather affects men mechanically, than morally and rationally. The communicant's exerci&s;e is to con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly that Te&s;timony where the death and exaltation of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is recorded, and endeavour to under&s;tand it, and believe it: In &s;o doing they will &s;ee <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> as the Scripture intends they &s;hould &s;ee him, viz. <HI>by the eyes of their mind,</HI> morally and &s;piritually. They ought to run over in their mind the Scripture ac|count of his death and exaltation: Con&s;ider this as truth, and &s;uitable for the ends and purpo&s;es for which it was revealed. This is an exerci&s;e worthy of tho&s;e who attempt to commemorate the death of their Lord and Saviour.</P>

What our Lord &s;uffered, is the very ground of his plea for his &s;aints in heaven: <HI>I have fini&s;hed the work thou gave&s;t me to do, therefore glorify thou me: I will that the&s;e whom thou ha&s;t given me, be with me, to behold my glory.</HI> This ordinance is a memorial, de&s;igned to bring to our minds a glorious fact, upon which all our happine&s;s dependeth. And who can con&s;ider this memorial, but mu&s;t call to mind the fact? <HI>That the &s;on of God died, and &s;uffered at Jeru&s;a|lem,</HI> for the rea&s;ons mentioned in the Scripture, we are all bound to believe; and the &s;acrament is a &s;acred memorial to put us in mind of this fact, as an object of our faith and regard. It is by &s;ome called <HI>a fea&s;t upon a &s;acrifice;</HI> but I think but improperly, for what|ever there might be of the nature of a &s;acrifice in the death of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> I can &s;ee nothing of this in the &s;acra|ment of the &s;upper. It is indeed a memorandum of the &s;acrifice of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> which he offered up for our &s;ins, but has nothing in it&s;elf of that nature.</P>
<PB N="164" REF="168">
<P>MY rea&s;ons for the foregoing a&s;&s;ertion are, that the fir&s;t in&s;titution had nothing of either a fea&s;t or a &s;acrifice in it. It immediately followed a fea&s;t, viz. <HI>the Pa&s;&s;over,</HI> and it is not likely that our Lord and his apo&s;tles meant to take two fea&s;ts at the &s;ame time; <HI>he took the bread</HI> after they had eaten, <HI>and the cup</HI> after they had &s;upped, and con&s;ecrated both; and told his di&s;ciples they were memorials of <HI>his body and blood,</HI> which were <HI>broken and &s;hed for them,</HI> and that they were to <HI>do this in remembrance of him.</HI> There was here no more than a thank&s;giving me|morial of the &s;ufferings of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and we cannot certainly depart from the in&s;titution, without being guilty of <HI>will-wor&s;hip.</HI> It is highly probable after our Lord and his apo&s;tles had fini&s;hed the pa&s;&s;over &s;upper, that <HI>this bread and wine</HI> which they made u&s;e of, was a very &s;mall quantity, rather &s;ignifying their thankful acknowlegement of the mercies they enjoyed by <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> than partaking of the nature of a fea&s;t.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to the original in&s;titution of this ordinance, there was nothing either of a fea&s;t or a &s;acrifice in it. It was immediately appointed after a fea&s;t, when the communicants were not fit for fea&s;ting. Nor do we hear of any of the &s;olemnities of a fea&s;t in it, except the ble&s;&s;ing of the elements, which was u&s;ed even in our Saviour's ordinary con|duct in eating and drinking. His &s;olemn <HI>ble&s;&s;ing the bread and wine,</HI> is no argument for this ordinance being a fea&s;t, more than his <HI>ble&s;&s;ing the loaves and fi&s;hes</HI> is any argument for it.</P>
<P>NEITHER is it a fea&s;t upon a &s;acrifice, for our Saviour was not yet offered up: And if this &s;acra|ment was a fea&s;t upon a &s;acrifice, or after one, as &s;ome term it, then it was a different ordinance to the apo&s;tles then, from what it was afterwards. The truth is, it is a &s;olemn memorial of a glorious fact, viz. <HI>That Chri&s;t &s;uffered and died for our &s;ins,</HI>
<PB N="165" REF="169">or a thankful acknowledgement of the Divine love manife&s;ted in the death of our Saviour <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>THE de&s;ign of it is to <HI>bring to our remem|brance</HI> the friend&s;hip and love of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and <HI>to &s;hew forth his death till he comes again:</HI> To confirm our faith in the truth of this fact, that <HI>he died for our &s;ins,</HI> to &s;et forth his love to us in the highe&s;t degree, in <HI>that he loved us,</HI> and <HI>gave him&s;elf to the death for us.</HI> One cannot help ob&s;erving the departure from the fir&s;t in&s;titution that prevails among &s;ome chri&s;|tians, who from their practice would make men be|lieve that the &s;acrament was not only a fea&s;t upon a &s;acrifice, but a &s;acrifice it&s;elf, when they cannot admini&s;trate it but at an altar. There was no &s;uch pageantry in the fir&s;t appointment, nor did the pri|mitive chri&s;tians ob&s;erve it. It has no doubt been the invention of tho&s;e who fir&s;t made it a real &s;acri|fice, and &s;o found out an altar for it al&s;o. The true and proper de&s;ign of it is, <HI>to put us in remembrance of the death of our Saviour,</HI> to commemorate his love, and to enjoy mutual communion with him therein.</P>
<P N="3">3. WE may &s;ee the proper medium through which we can behold the manife&s;tations of the glory of God. The death and exaltation of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> are the true means thro' which we can behold the Divine &s;plendour of the Divine nature. We only can be|hold the Father in him, who &s;ays, <HI>He that hath &s;een me hath &s;een the Father.</HI> Thro' this medium we may learn what is in heaven, by anticipation, and <HI>&s;ee the land that is afar off</HI> thro' the light of the &s;on of righteou&s;ne&s;s. In this ordinance of the &s;upper, you have the &s;ame object repre&s;ented which fills heaven with glory, and the ho&s;ts there with love and admiration.</P>
<P>ALL the di&s;coveries of the love of God, which give joy to men in this life, are made through the death of his <HI>well-beloved &s;on, in whom he is well
<PB N="166" REF="170">plea&s;ed.</HI> For this purpo&s;e he is revealed, as he that was <HI>dead and is now alive, and liveth for evermore.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. WE may rea&s;on to try our&s;elves whether or not we have as yet &s;een God thro' the death and exaltation of his &s;on <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI>&mdash;If &s;o, then (1) The plan of grace exhibited in the New Covenant di&s;pen&s;ation, will appear con&s;i&s;tent and beautiful. Such as view the Divine character thro' the death and exaltation of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> will &s;ee it con&s;i&s;tent with God to &s;ave guilty &s;inners with honour to his ble&s;&s;ed character. The love of God in this New Covenant plan will appear exceeding great and glo|rious: For here the expen&s;ive method of venting his love, in con&s;i&s;tency with his other attributes, will immediately pre&s;ent it&s;elf. Could the love of <HI>Jehovah</HI> expre&s;s it&s;elf no other way but thro' the death of his well-beloved &s;on, how great mu&s;t it be to come over &s;uch a difficulty?</P>
<P>THIS appears a very con&s;i&s;tent thing to tho&s;e who under&s;tand the nature of the New Covenant, and the character of God di&s;played therein: For thro' <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t, mercy and truth meet together, righ|teou&s;ne&s;s and peace ki&s;s one another.</HI> It is an evidence tho&s;e per&s;ons have not &s;een God thro' <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> who accu&s;e the covenant of grace with incon&s;i&s;ten|cy, or &s;eek happine&s;s thro' any other &s;cheme or contrivance. Tho&s;e who rea&s;on again&s;t the &s;atis|faction of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> accu&s;e this whole plan with incon&s;i&s;tency, and look upon it as a &s;cheme of folly, and a creature of fancy. But chri&s;tians who have viewed God right, thro' his only begotten &s;on, will &s;ee that when he accepted of a &s;atisfaction from <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> he only opened a way for <HI>grace to abound to the-chief of &s;inners,</HI> and made it con&s;i&s;tent for his truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s <HI>to ju&s;tify the ungodly;</HI> and that there appears more wi&s;dom in appointing of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> for this end, than if he had merely forgiven &s;in without a &s;atisfaction. By comparing <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s
<PB N="167" REF="171">fitne&s;s for his office of mediator&s;hip, and his ful|filling it, a &s;incere &s;oul admires the wi&s;dom of God, and adores his goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>IF the Almighty had forgiven &s;in without a &s;a|tisfaction, the rebellious minds of &s;inners would have been more &s;et upon &s;in, and pre&s;umptuou&s;ly abu&s;ed the goodne&s;s of God, which they do not|with&s;tanding; but when they con&s;ider how &s;evere and ju&s;t he is, they can have no rea&s;on to expect impunity. They cannot look for more favour than he gave his own &s;on, whom he made &s;uffer the cruel death of the cro&s;s, when he found him guilty by bearing the &s;ins of others. <HI>If it was thus in the green tree, what mu&s;t it be in the dry?</HI> A true chri&s;tian &s;ees this plan of &s;alvation as the only con|&s;i&s;tent way of &s;aving &s;inners: The be&s;t &s;cheme for encrea&s;ing true love, and preventing pre&s;umption. It plea&s;es believers, becau&s;e God is the author of it. It argues a very bad heart to find fault with the &s;chemes of the Almighty, when we are not certain, but after our deepe&s;t &s;earch, that the mi&s;take lies in our enquiry, not in that plan which we condemn. We ought not to mea&s;ure the con&s;i&s;tency of the Divine conduct by our weak under&s;tanding; for <HI>as the heaven is higher than the earth, &s;o are his ways higher than our ways.</HI> A true believer has this per|&s;ua&s;ion in him&s;elf, that all God's di&s;pen&s;ations are right, and that he cannot err; he believes it is right whatever God &s;ays or does.</P>
<P>THOSE that wi&s;h the covenant of grace were not as it is, or do not believe the account of it in Divine revelation, have not yet &s;een God through the gla&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s death and exaltation. The death and exaltation of the Redeemer of men, were chief and principal articles of this covenant. It was agreed that when he &s;hould <HI>make his &s;oul an offering for &s;in, he &s;hould &s;ee his &s;eed; that he &s;hould have a name above every name: That at the name of
<PB N="168" REF="172">Je&s;us every knee &s;hould bow, and every tongue confe&s;s.</HI> This plan of grace was the joy and con&s;olation of <HI>David</HI> when he was on his death-bed, <HI>Tho' my hou&s;e be not &s;o with God, yet he hath made with me a cove|nant, ordered in all things and &s;ure: And this is all my &s;alvation, and all my de&s;ire, tho' he makes it not to grow.</HI> It is one of the ways <HI>Satan</HI> works upon our evil hearts of unbelief, to make us find fault with the plan of &s;alvation, and thereby make us &s;trike at the very foundation of our own happine&s;s. It is a peculiar property of that faith that is of the opera|tion of God to be &s;atisfied with, and re&s;ts upon the &s;cheme of the New Covenant for both pre&s;ent and future happine&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2. THOSE who have &s;een the Divine charac|ter, &s;hining thro' the death and exaltation of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> will be changed and transformed with that di&s;covery: By thus <HI>beholding the glory of God,</HI> they will <HI>be changed into the &s;ame image, from glory to glory.</HI> A right view of God thro' <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> will have &s;uch an influence upon the mind, as to change the whole affections from earthly to heavenly things. It will change their notions of the Divine law: What was formerly burthen &s;ome and heavy, be|comes now ea&s;y and light. The law of God, as &s;oon as it is con&s;idered as <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s yoke, becomes ea&s;y and light. The &s;oul a&s;&s;ents to the words of <HI>Chri&s;t, My yoke is ea&s;y, and my burthen is light.</HI> By &s;uch a view of God's character, and the excellency of his law, a chri&s;tian will &s;ay with <HI>David, I have &s;aid of thy commandments, that in all things they are right.</HI> Such a view of God <HI>in the face of Je&s;us,</HI> &s;ets the purity and perfection of God's law, and the fullne&s;s of grace in oppo&s;ition to one another, and &s;hews that the precepts of righteou&s;ne&s;s are ea&s;y, when <HI>Jehovah is their righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;trength.</HI> This con&s;ideration of God, as in <HI>Je&s;us reconciled,</HI> affords to the &s;oul a &s;ure per&s;ua&s;ion of receiving &s;trength.
<PB N="169" REF="173">The &s;oul can now &s;ay, <HI>I can do all things through Chri&s;t &s;trengthening me.</HI> Every affection of the mind is hereby changed. By &s;uch a di&s;covery of the Di|vine character, <HI>in the face of Je&s;us, all things</HI> in the &s;oul <HI>become new, old things are done away.</HI></P>
<P>THIS gives chri&s;tians other views of good men than they formerly had. The &s;aints that were be|fore the objects of their ridicule and deri&s;ion, they look upon as <HI>the excellent ones in the earth,</HI> and pla|ces <HI>their delight in them</HI> for <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s &s;ake. Having &s;een the excellency of God thro' <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> they are per&s;uaded that all that belongs to him are ex|cellent. From this con&s;ideration godly men be|come &s;weet companions to &s;uch as before de&s;pi&s;ed them, and are looked upon as the mo&s;t u&s;eful mem|bers of &s;ociety. The relation they &s;tand in to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> makes &s;uch as have &s;een God thro' the death and exaltation of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> love them. This change extends to thoughts, words, and actions. It begets humility, and makes the true believer account him&s;elf <HI>le&s;s than the lea&s;t of all &s;aints.</HI> Such a view of God brings down all vanity. It was &s;uch a view of the Divine character, which made <HI>Job</HI> &s;ay, <HI>I loath and abhor my&s;elf in du&s;t and a&s;hes:</HI> And made <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> &s;ay, <HI>I am a man of unclean lips, for mine eyes have &s;een the King, the Lord of ho&s;ts.</HI> Such a view of the Deity aba&s;eth men in their own e&s;teem: For it &s;hews them that they are obliged to another for all their virtues and good qualifications.</P>
<P>MEN are naturally inclined to have an over|high opinion of them&s;elves, and to be filled with pride and vanity, at the thoughts of their own en|dowments. This makes them un&s;ociable, ra&s;h and incon&s;iderate: But when they get a &s;ight of God thro' the death and exaltation of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> they &s;ee of how little e&s;teem the&s;e things are in the &s;ight of God; who in&s;tead of valuing men for the&s;e conceived excellencies, only e&s;teems them when they
<PB N="170" REF="174">lay them a&s;ide. It is this that brings down the <HI>haughtine&s;s of man's looks, and lays him in the du&s;t be|fore his maker;</HI> it is this that <HI>&s;tains the pride of all human glory,</HI> and brings men to <HI>deny them&s;elves, and take up their cro&s;s and follow Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>SUCH a view of God will make the chri&s;tian account the&s;e things lo&s;s, which formerly he ac|counted gain, <HI>that he may be found in Chri&s;t, not having his own righteou&s;ne&s;s, which is of the law, but that which is of God by faith.</HI></P>
<P>THIS al&s;o makes men change their actions and manner of Life. Such things as formerly plea&s;ed their &s;en&s;es, and &s;atisfied their unruly appe|tites, are made bitter and unplea&s;ant. The whole moral frame being changed by the view of God they have obtained thro' <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> they have o|ther &s;entiments of men and things, and change their manner of acting, to conform to their new &s;entiments. <HI>They walk not after the fle&s;h, but after the &s;pirit.</HI> The rea&s;on of this is, becau&s;e they have got new views of the Divine character thro' him <HI>who is the image of the invi&s;ible God,</HI> and thereby un|der&s;tand, <HI>that there is now no condemnation to them that are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>ACTION is the very life of religion, and may be called its vi&s;ible exi&s;tence. Where we &s;ee no good action, our charity can never direct us to think there is any religion: <HI>By their fruit ye &s;hall know them.</HI> But all tho&s;e who have &s;een the true character of <HI>Jehovah,</HI> thro' the death and exalta|tion of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> will find them&s;elves obliged <HI>to main|tain good works.</HI> Wherever we &s;ee a conver&s;ation abounding in good actions, we ought according to the rules of charity believe they know the true character of God thro' <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t:</HI> For there can|not be an effect without a cau&s;e. The uncharita|ble rea&s;onings of men towards one another are very ungodly: Many are &s;o uncharitable as to impute
<PB N="171" REF="175">fal&s;e motives and ends to their fellow chri&s;tians, when they cannot find fault with their actions; but this is unju&s;t, <HI>for charity thinketh no evil.</HI> There is nothing more common, than if another will not &s;ub&s;cribe our creed for us, to think all his good actions are of no value before God. But this is in effect to &s;ay, <HI>that we are the people, and wi&s;dom &s;hall die with us.</HI> For if any others excel us in virtuous actions, it is an evidence they know and believe the true creed of religion better than us.</P>
<P>THE man who&s;e life and actions be&s;t expre&s;s his conformity to the law of God, declares that he has the true judgment of his character: For it is only tho&s;e <HI>who know God's name, who will put their tru&s;t in him.</HI> If a man &s;hould in words deny a pro|po&s;ition of which we are very fond of; but yet di|rect his life according to the tenor of it, it &s;hews that all the difference con&s;i&s;ts in words, and is no more but a mi&s;under&s;tanding of one another. If we find others in the path of virtue, and travelling heaven-ward, we have rea&s;on to believe, that they know and believe in the things that are there. I cannot help ob&s;erving with &s;orrow, the error that contending parties, in religion, fall into upon this head. Each are &s;o fond of their own definition of words and &s;entiments, that they imagine all others &s;hould under&s;tand them in the &s;ame light which they do; words are arbitrary, and every one may have his own mode of expre&s;&s;ion, and it rarely hap|pens that we can fully under&s;tand one another's i|deas by the words u&s;ed to expre&s;s them. Action is not &s;o equivocal, it is this that be&s;t expre&s;&s;es our meaning. When actions are the &s;ame, there is &s;trong pre&s;umption that actors have the &s;ame capital ideas, and ought not to differ about words.</P>
<P>SUCH a view of God thro' <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> will likewi&s;e direct our words. Vain, idle, &s;inful words, are expre&s;&s;ive of a bad heart: With the&s;e God is
<PB N="170" REF="176"><GAP DESC="DUPLICATE">
<PB N="171" REF="177"><GAP DESC="DUPLICATE">
<PB N="172" REF="178">offended, and will at la&s;t puni&s;h the offenders if they do not repent. Tho&s;e who have obtained di&s;tinct views of God through the death and exaltation of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> will endeavour not to &s;in with their mouths. The tongue is like the index of the heart, <HI>out of the abundance of the heart the mouth &s;peaketh.</HI> Such a di&s;covery of God, as what we have already been mentioning, will fill the mouths of chri&s;tians with prai&s;e, and make them beware of polluting their lips with vain and &s;inful conver&s;ation: It made <HI>David hate and &s;hun the company of vain per&s;ons,</HI> and cau&s;ed him to pray that God <HI>would &s;et a watch before his heart, and keep the door of his lips.</HI></P>
<P>IT is an evidence that men have no knowledge of the Divine character, who allow them&s;elves to &s;peak ra&s;hly and unadvi&s;edly in habitual conver&s;a|tion. Nor is it any evidence of the knowledge of God, but the contrary, when men &s;landerou&s;ly ca|lumniate one another. The upright man who knows the character of God, thro' <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t, will not take up a fal&s;e report again&s;t his neighbours.</HI> This is a place of the world where there is much rea&s;on to fear; but very few have &s;een the Divine charac|ter as di&s;played in a Redeemer. My rea&s;on for this is, the greate&s;t part, even of tho&s;e who would have religious characters, are continually employed either in rai&s;ing or <HI>taking up fal&s;e reports</HI> of one a|nother. This is &s;uch an u&s;e of the tongue as no good man ever allowed him&s;elf to practi&s;e. It is an evidence of ignorance of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and that Spirit of holine&s;s and truth, which directs the tongues and conver&s;ation of good and holy men. It is indeed in this place the fa&s;hion for men to employ their tongues in vile &s;candal, and <HI>taking up evil reports</HI> again&s;t the innocent. But it is only &s;hewing the world their ignorance of God, and that they are unbelievers. It would appear to me, that many have been taught this practice by their reli|gious
<PB N="173" REF="179">guides, for &s;ome of them are fir&s;t in publi&s;h|ing &s;candal with their tongues. But among whom this abounds, whatever be their character in other re&s;pects, their real character is, that they are un|believers.</P>
<P N="3">3. A VIEW of God thro' <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as once dead, but now alive,</HI> will incline men to de&s;ire the &s;ame enjoyment to others. The woman of <HI>Sama|ria</HI> had no &s;ooner got a view of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> as the Me&s;&s;iah, and &s;een him who is the &s;pirit and truth in him, than &s;he ran &s;peedily to acquaint her friends and fellow citizens of her di&s;covery: <HI>Come &s;ee a man who told me all things that ever I did; is not this the Chri&s;t?</HI> Such as have ta&s;ted of the enjoyment of communion with God in truth and reality, want to make this privilege diffu&s;ive. When <HI>Philip</HI> found <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> he went and told <HI>Nathaniel; We have found the Me&s;&s;iah, who is called Chri&s;t, of whom Mo&s;es and the prophets wrote.</HI> This di&s;covery begets genero|&s;ity. The &s;incere &s;oul, who has &s;een God thro' his well-beloved &s;on <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> is ready to embrace all men into the embraces of their good-will. This opens and expands the &s;oul, as it were, and makes men of a true benevolent di&s;po&s;ition. It di&s;po&s;es men to extend their good wi&s;hes and endeavours to all they can reach. The good-will of God ex|hibited in that di&s;covery they have of him thro' the death and exaltation of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> &s;hews them the rea&s;on why they &s;hould love all men. If he was plea&s;ed, out of love, to do good to the ill-de&s;erving, and to us when we were his enemies, we may &s;ee it is but ju&s;t for us to imitate him in goodne&s;s. Such a di&s;covery impre&s;&s;es the mind with the like tem|per and di&s;po&s;ition, &s;o that a chri&s;tian hereby <HI>has the &s;ame mind in him that was in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>THAT man that pretends to be a child of God, and is not kind and benevolent to his brethren and fellow-men, wants the mo&s;t &s;hining branch of that
<PB N="174" REF="180">character: For tho&s;e who have &s;een the love of God thro' the medium of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s death and exaltation, will love to make all others &s;hare of its influence as well as them&s;elves. Their prayers, their endea|vours, their &s;tudy night and day will be, <HI>that Jeru&s;a|lem may have peace, that I&s;rael may be &s;aved.</HI> That religion that is wrapt up in private happine&s;s, and extends not to the good of others, proceeds from a fal&s;e view of the Divine character. There are &s;ome who mean no more by being religious but to e|&s;cape perdition, and <HI>have their &s;ouls for a prey;</HI> to get to heaven, whoever may go to hell; but &s;uch have not true and worthy notions of God, otherwi&s;e they would wi&s;h <HI>his kingdom to come</HI> in others as well as them&s;elves.

<P N="4">4. SUCH as have &s;een God, thro' the death and exaltation of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> will lay a&s;ide all their own vain conceits and inventions. Man is no &s;ooner born, <HI>but he &s;eeks out many inventions;</HI> the greate&s;t part of which are vain and &s;inful. Inventions about hap|pine&s;s take up a great part of men's concern and time; and their chief thought is to have a hap|pine&s;s according to their vain conceits thereof. Some have more gro&s;s, and others more refined notions of happine&s;s; yet both are inventions of their own. When they con&s;ider the works of God, they determine what they think he &s;hould be, and what he ought to do. A &s;en&s;e of guilt, in &s;ome de|gree, is in&s;eparable from a guilty con&s;cience; this puts men upon &s;ome inventions to contrive a cha|racter for God &s;uitable to their notions of happine&s;s. Thus they often conceive of him, as a Being all goodne&s;s, only in relation to what they find they need, without con&s;idering whether it may an&s;wer the ends of Divine government. Their hopes and fears are directed upon a plan of their own, and they live by their own inventions.&mdash;As &s;oon as they
<PB N="175" REF="181">are enabled to view God thro' the death of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> they will &s;ee the folly of all their inventions, in &s;eek|ing to ju&s;tify the way of God to men, any other way than by the death of his &s;on <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>THAT con&s;i&s;tency they were &s;eeking in other &s;chemes and methods, will appear be&s;t and brighte&s;t in the face of God's anointed. There the harmony of the Divine attributes will appear with full lu&s;tre; <HI>for mercy and truth meet together, righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace</HI> mutually <HI>embrace each other,</HI> in the New Co|venant plan of &s;alvation. It is there that the truth of the Divine threatning is verified, and mercy is vented to guilty men; for <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> in dying, bore that cur&s;e that was threatned and due to &s;inners, <HI>in his own body on the tree,</HI> whereby the Divine veracity is a&s;certained, and God appears <HI>ju&s;t in ju&s;tifying the ungodly.</HI> No inju&s;tice or fal&s;hood can be laid to his charge, for he has fully executed his ju&s;tice upon <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> He is al&s;o full of goodne&s;s and mercy for <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s &s;ake to men. Whatever a righteous law could demand, or ju&s;tice require, was fulfilled in <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> This is the &s;cheme that ju&s;tifies the ways of God to men. This is the method that the &s;oul fixes upon, when it views the character of God thro' the death of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> All former vain conceits are given up, and every fooli&s;h &s;cheme which pride and vanity were fond of. The language of faith, and dependence upon God, now is, <HI>Surely in the Lord have I righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;trength.</HI> Every view of God thro' the death and exaltation of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> is amiable and &s;weet, and all the properties of his na|ture and character con&s;i&s;tent.</P>
<P>EVERY other &s;cheme but that which is mani|fe&s;ted in the death and exaltation of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> makes God either dreadful, or incon&s;i&s;tently good. All other mediums pre&s;ent God in &s;ome wrong point of view; but this &s;ets forth his character as beauti|ful, and clear of all contradiction: No impo&s;&s;ibili|ty
<PB N="176" REF="182">nor contradiction appears in his actions, nor the lea&s;t error in his plans</P>
<P N="5">5.

The believer looks forward, <HI>and pre&s;&s;es towards the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>THE Apo&s;tle calls an attendance to the truth and ordinances of the go&s;pel, <HI>A walking in the light,</HI> 1 John i. 7. <HI>Walk in the light, as he is in the light,</HI> and <HI>have fellow&s;hip one with another; and the blood of Je&s;us, his &s;on, clean&s;eth you from all &s;in.</HI> The way of righteou&s;ne&s;s is clear, and a <HI>path of light,</HI> to &s;uch as have &s;een the Divine character di&s;played thro' the death and interce&s;&s;ion of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> There are no objections that can be propo&s;ed, but there is an an&s;wer to them in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s death and interce&s;|&s;ion. This is called a <HI>walking in the light,</HI> to make an u&s;e and improvement of the&s;e in the u&s;e of all ordinary means. Chri&s;tians who contemplate God thro' this ble&s;&s;ed medium of the Mediator&s;hip of <HI>Chri&s;t, walk in the light of God's law:</HI> This is a <HI>light unto their feet, and a lamp unto their path. They meditate upon God's law day and night.</HI> By a belie|ving view of him that <HI>was dead, and is now alive,</HI> the true believer <HI>runs his race with patience, looking unto Je&s;us the author and fini&s;her of his faith.</HI> It is his &s;tudy and endeavour to <HI>walk in the law of the Lord all the days of his life.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall now conclude this &s;ubject with a &s;hort exhortation.</P>
<P N="1">1. BE con&s;tant in fixing the eyes of your mind upon this ever ble&s;&s;ed medium, that you may &s;ee
<PB N="177" REF="183">tho&s;e things that are invi&s;ible. If you con&s;ider the death and exaltation of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> right, you may &s;ee tho&s;e things that are hid from the eyes of &s;en&s;e and carnal rea&s;on. The mind may a&s;cend as it were to heaven, and contemplate the joys of another life, thro' <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> who hath gone before <HI>to prepare a place for his people.</HI> The excellencies of another life can never be rightly under&s;tood, but by fir&s;t con|&s;idering the character of God, expre&s;&s;ed in a Media|tor. To be acquainted with that enjoyment which will make heaven to be what it really is, will make this pre&s;ent life a joy, and the thought of death de|lightful. Our views of future happine&s;s will afford great plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction to our &s;ouls; when thro' <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> the true medium of communion with God, we learn that this happine&s;s will con&s;i&s;t in our being ever near to the Almighty, and ever enjoy his favour. The various thoughts of God that different per&s;ons have, are mo&s;t of them un|worthy, both of his revealed character, and of that profe&s;&s;ion of holine&s;s chri&s;tians pretend to. Some con&s;ider Deity at fir&s;t hand (if we may &s;o &s;peak) and are di&s;po&s;ed to deal with him without any Me|diator: They do not think their circum&s;tances &s;o bad as to need the mediation of another. They do imagine they are not &s;o blind and &s;hort-&s;ighted, but they can contemplate the mo&s;t di&s;tant Divine ob|jects without the aid of any medium. But we ought to reflect upon what revelation has told us concerning <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> our Lord: That he <HI>is the true light that lighteneth every man that cometh into the world:</HI> That he came into this world to be the light of it, and the medium thro' which we may contemplate the Divine attributes, and &s;ee God with comfort and true &s;atisfaction. When we therefore enquire after the nature and attributes of God, let us <HI>look</HI> fir&s;t <HI>to Je&s;us the author and fini&s;h|er of our faith:</HI> For it is thro' him we can know God
<PB N="178" REF="184">in a right and acceptable manner. It is he who &s;ees <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> &s;ees the Father; <HI>He that hath &s;een me hath &s;een the Father,</HI> John xiv. 9. Con&s;ider then in the mo&s;t &s;erious manner the character of our Redeemer, if you would know the character of the true God; he hath made known the Father unto us: <HI>The only begotten, who is in the bo&s;om of the Fa|ther, he hath declared him.</HI> In contemplating the Divine character, con&s;ider him <HI>who was dead, and is now alive.</HI></P>

<P>OUR Lord and Redeemer manife&s;ts him&s;elf in this character, in our text, for the con&s;tant comfort of his church in all ages. He declares him&s;elf ve&s;t|ed with all power and authority, to rule over and defend his people again&s;t all the de&s;igns of earth and hell. His being <HI>alive for evermore,</HI> refers unto his being the Mediator and Admini&s;trator of the New Covenant. That he is alive as God, is not here immediately referred unto: For his <HI>being alive,</HI> is oppo&s;ed unto his <HI>being dead,</HI> which could never happen unto his Deity. For the comfort of the Apo&s;tle, the &s;even churches of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and his people in all ages, he te&s;tifies, that he is the living execu|tor of his own Te&s;tament, and <HI>is alive for evermore,</HI> to apply the benefits of it to them for whom he died; and whatever the <HI>Jews,</HI> or any others, might think of the mean appearance while here, in his &s;tate of humiliation, yet he was alive in human na|ture, both for his own honour, and his people's e|ternal comfort and advantage.</P>
<P>HE &s;hews the Apo&s;tle that in his exalted &s;tate he was inve&s;ted with full power and authority, to manage all things for his church's good, and that tho&s;e things that were mo&s;t to be feared, and could be lea&s;t avoided by men, were in his hand: <HI>For he has the keys of hell and death.</HI> No man can prevent death, nor hell after it, if the guilt of &s;in be not taken away; but <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is authori&s;ed, as <HI>the King of his church,</HI> to keep off death from his people till they be converted, and to re&s;train the powers of darkne&s;s, that they may not hurt his children in this world, nor hinder their happine&s;s in the next. Hell and death are here figures of all the enemies of our &s;alvation; and <HI>Chri&s;t having the keys</HI> of the&s;e, points out that he has all our enemies under his power and command: To this purpo&s;e the church ex|pre&s;&s;eth her&s;elf, I&s;a. xxxiii. 22. <HI>The Lord is our judge,

<P N="1">1. HE prevents his cho&s;en &s;eed from falling in|to ab&s;olute ruin and mi&s;ery before their conver&s;ion. His prevenient goodne&s;s keeps them from being &s;wallowed up by death and hell, while in a &s;tate of nature and under the cur&s;e. When <HI>they are chil|dren of wrath even as others, and heirs of condemna|tion, following divers lu&s;ts and plea&s;ures,</HI> and nothing between them and eternal mi&s;ery, but uncertain life, which every accident threatens to take away; he pre&s;erves them &s;afe alive till Divine power reaches their &s;ouls, in the day of conver&s;ion, and they be|come willing &s;ubjects to his government.</P>
<P>MANY times the grave &s;eems to open its de|vouring mouth to &s;wallow them up in the mid&s;t of their &s;ins and guilt, but <HI>Je&s;us</HI> has power over death, &s;huts the grave's devouring mouth, and they are pre&s;erved. Many me&s;&s;engers of mortality come to the chri&s;tian's door before his conver&s;ion, and to all human probability, are likely to carry him off to hell and endle&s;s mi&s;ery; but as <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> keeps <HI>the keys of hell and death,</HI> the&s;e me&s;&s;en|gers cannot harm any without his warrant. He brings them back <HI>from the gates of death,</HI> and &s;aves them from ruin and de&s;truction. This was the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI>'s experience, P&s;al. ciii. 4. <HI>Who redeemeth thy life from de&s;truction, and crowneth thee with loving kindne&s;s and tender mercies.</HI> When the powers of
<PB N="182" REF="190">darkne&s;s are by their influence hurrying on the per|&s;on to death and de&s;truction, and as it were tri|umphing in their <HI>lawful captive,</HI> and every lu&s;t and prejudice in the heart concurring to po&s;t him on to the &s;helves of ruin and death; when wicked companions &s;trengthen the&s;e prejudices, and fal&s;e friends &s;ooth him up with the &s;afety of his pre&s;ent condition, &s;o that he is to all appearance locked fa&s;t up, and &s;ecured in the pri&s;on of &s;piritual death, and ready for eternal ruin; <HI>Satan</HI> wants nothing but the key of natural death to &s;end him into the pri&s;on of hell; even in this critical period he is pre|&s;erved. He who <HI>lives for evermore,</HI> is him&s;elf Lord of that power, and keeps both the keys of &s;piri$ual and temporal death: <HI>So he openeth and no man &s;hut|teth, and &s;hutteth and no man openeth.</HI> Tho' <HI>Satan</HI> keeps his pri&s;oner fa&s;t till the appointed time, yet <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is ma&s;ter of the keys him&s;elf, and has power to open when he plea&s;eth. And as he keeps the door of natural death &s;hut, till the time determined, &s;o he loo&s;es the bands of &s;piritual death, opens the door, and &s;ets the pri&s;oner free. For this rea&s;on he is inve&s;ted with this power, I&s;a. lxi. 1. <HI>The Lord God hath anointed me to open the pri&s;on doors to them that are bound.</HI> Which bringeth me to ob&s;erve.</P>
<P N="2">2. THAT this living <HI>e&s;us,</HI> the Lord of his church, in his Divine admini&s;tration, gives al&s;o effectual grace, and renewing influence to his people. This is the way he u&s;es his power and authority, in &s;aving his people from &s;piritual death and the dominion of &s;in. This power he exerci&s;eth in the way of opening, as he before made u&s;e of in the way of &s;hutting, <HI>for he openeth and none can &s;hut.</HI> Tho' the heart be &s;hut again&s;t him, and locked up with many prejudices and pa&s;&s;ions; every corrupt lu&s;t and affection, like &s;o many bolts or bars in the &s;oul, make re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the evidence of Divine truth, and the power of Divine grace; yet <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> opens them all.</P>
<PB N="183" REF="191">
<P>HE removes men's ignorance with the key of knowledge. Ignorance of God, our intere&s;t and duty, is like a &s;trong bar that keeps us fa&s;t under the power of &s;in: For. <HI>Solomon</HI> tells us, <HI>without knowledge the heart is not good:</HI> But <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in the day of effectual calling, enlightens the mind in the knowledge of him&s;elf, by the power of his ble&s;&s;ed Spirit: Brings home the evidence of Divine tru$h with power upon the &s;oul. He makes them <HI>that were &s;ometime darkne&s;s, become light in the Lord.</HI> He was inve&s;ted with the dignity of keeping the keys of hell and death, that he might <HI>open the eyes of the blind, to bring forth the pri&s;oners out of pri&s;on; and them that &s;it in darkne&s;s out of the pri&s;on-hou&s;e,</HI> I&s;a. xlii. 7.</P>
<P>DIVINE knowledge is to the &s;oul what a key is to one in a dark dungeon; it lets in light to the mind, by opening the blinded under&s;tanding, and refre&s;hing the &s;oul with the view of new and de|lightful objects. <HI>Solomon</HI>'s <HI>Proverb</HI> is true in this ca&s;e, in an eminent &s;en&s;e: <HI>Surely the light is &s;weet, and it is a plea&s;ant thing for the eyes to behold the &s;un.</HI> Our Redeemer by his Divine power opens the darkened mind, that has long been &s;hut again&s;t the evidence of Divine truth; and the &s;oul that was like a dungeon for darkne&s;s, is now made like a palace for light and beauty.</P>
<P>THESE truths of which the &s;oul had no true knowledge before, nor beheld any beauty or excel|lency in, &s;hine forth with &s;plendour and glory. The Redeemer by this means opens the under&s;tanding, frees the mind from the power of ignorance, and makes a glorious light &s;hine into the &s;oul. This key of knowledge, applied by the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> to the &s;oul, makes one both know God and him&s;elf. It &s;ets his character in the mo&s;t lively view before the mind, and pre&s;ents the lovely relations he &s;tands in to men by a Redeemer. What of the
<PB N="184" REF="192">Divine character was hid before, or at lea&s;t not rightly under&s;tood, but appeared as fooli&s;hne&s;s to the mind, now appears to be the mo&s;t eminent branch of knowledge. <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> who &s;eemed to the ignorant &s;oul <HI>as a root out of a dry ground,</HI> appears to the mind <HI>altogether lovely;</HI> and &s;uch as have this di&s;covery, <HI>determine to know nothing but Je&s;us Chri&s;t and him crucified.</HI> It makes them know the u&s;eful|ne&s;s of the Redeemer, and cau&s;eth them, like <HI>Na|thaniel,</HI> to &s;ay, <HI>Thou art the &s;on of God, thou art the king of I&s;rael:</HI> Or like <HI>Thomas, My Lord, and my God.</HI> It lets the &s;oul into noble and di&s;tingui&s;hing di&s;|coveries. It is like a key that opens the door of a palace, where all the <HI>magnalia</HI> of &s;tate are &s;een, where the rights of the kingdom are beheld, the &s;tatutes and laws are laid open: Or it is a letting in the &s;oul to the under&s;tanding of what God in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is to them that believe in him; in whom they &s;ee all things good for the pre&s;ent, and glorious and good things to come. The &s;oul who knew nothing of God's method of reconciliation before, nor had the lea&s;t under&s;tanding of the &s;cheme of &s;alvation, is by this Divine knowledge let in to the great <HI>arcana</HI> of &s;alvation, and made to under&s;tand the glory of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> the king of his church, and to &s;ee the &s;plendour of his kingdom.</P>
<P>BY this key of knowledge, <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> who <HI>lives for evermore,</HI> lets his people into the knowledge of them&s;elves. Many things that lay hid and un|perceived in the time of ignorance, are now laid open to our view. The deceitfulne&s;s of the heart is laid open, by bringing in the knowledge of the truth into the mind. It is by this that <HI>the candle of the Lord</HI> is lightened in the &s;oul, by which a man &s;ees <HI>the plagues of his own heart.</HI> The evidence of the truth upon the con&s;cience, is a light in the &s;oul that the key of knowledge lets in, by opening up to the under&s;tanding <HI>the hidden works of darkne&s;s.</HI>
<PB N="185" REF="193">It is this that opens <HI>the chambers of imagery, and digs a hole through the wall</HI> of ignorance, and di&s;covers the rivals of the Almighty in the &s;oul. By this key, the &s;ecret &s;prings of pride, athei&s;m and un|belief, are laid open and expo&s;ed to view. This like a clue leads con&s;cience thro' all the latent turn|ings of iniquity in the &s;oul, and di&s;covers to man what he really is. This key of knowledge, is by the Redeemer made to operate in the con&s;cience, by which it is enabled to &s;earch out the mo&s;t hidden actions, and to find out their &s;prings and fir&s;t prin|ciples: Hereby it is enabled and capacitated to bani&s;h the dominion of deadly prejudices out of the &s;oul. After this manner does our ever living Re|deemer deliver his people from ignorance.</P>
<P>JESUS CHRIST frees his people from ob&s;ti|nacy, by the key of powerful per&s;ua&s;ion. Our &s;ouls by nature are in bondage, as to chu&s;ing what is pure and holy; for tho' our will hath a power to chu&s;e whatever it doth embrace, yet the corruption of our nature is &s;uch, that the will cannot chu&s;e in a holy and pure manner. There is a natural li|berty e&s;&s;ential to the human will, &s;o that it never can be forced in any condition; yet, till by the power of Divine truth it be freed from its corrup|tion, it never chu&s;eth both freely and purely. There is an oppo&s;ition to purity in the human will &s;ince the fall of our fir&s;t parents; &s;o that men in an unconverted &s;tate make choice of evil in&s;tead of what is good. Not that any man will chu&s;e what he is per&s;uaded is evil; but thro' ignorance of the truth, he mi&s;takes evil for good, and at la&s;t thro' the influence of habit and cu&s;tom, is unwilling to act otherwi&s;e than he hath done. What men have had a long plea&s;ure in, tho' it may be bad, they will find their inclination follows after, even contrary to their judgment. The will of man may be com|pared to a &s;pring that is made to open two ways,
<PB N="186" REF="194">or indifferently to incline to either &s;ide; but being &s;poiled, only opens one way. The human will at fir&s;t, was free to either good or evil; but as &s;oon as it was corrupted by the deceit of the evil one, the equal ballance of its power now inclined to the wrong &s;ide.</P>
<P>IT is indeed &s;till free, that it is not forced to chu&s;e any object, but is determined to act by its own liberty; yet purity is far from being the object of its liberty. It is goodne&s;s that now de|termines the human will; but holine&s;s and purity are not taken into the notion of this goodne&s;s. When human liberty was in its perfection, purity was the chief of what was accounted goodne&s;s; but &s;ince the deceit of the father of lies entered into the hearts of men, they have had a deceitful &s;en&s;e of liberty ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>WHAT men often account liberty, is indepen|dency; and pretending to have a liberty to chu&s;e or do what they plea&s;e, they make them&s;elves inde|pendent beings. The will of man, like the &s;pring we mentioned, was at fir&s;t capable to chu&s;e either good or evil, and while free of the deceit of the evil one turned the right way; but no &s;ooner did the enemy of God and man deceive our fir&s;t parents, and di&s;eminate his poi&s;on into human nature, than rebellion, his genuine offspring, took up the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the human will. Tho' all the fraud he was ma&s;ter of could not de&s;troy a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt; yet ever after this fatal event, the will of mankind hath been ob&s;tinate again&s;t holine&s;s and purity.</P>
<P>THO' our wills may outwardly &s;eem to be open by a free volition towards what &s;uits the depraved propen&s;ity of the human heart; yet when the motives of choice are con&s;idered, we will find that the choice is ill directed, and that all the liberty ungodly men are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, con&s;i$$s in not being forced by any external cau&s;e. The will of a wicked
<PB N="187" REF="195">man is even as free as that of a good one, in chu&s;ing what &s;uits his inclination; and in no &s;en&s;e can he be &s;aid to be forced, otherwi&s;e he would not be wor|thy of blame for what he made choice of; but then his liberty runs in a deceitful channel, and he freely chu&s;es what is really hurtful to him&s;elf. But <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> reaches home per&s;ua&s;ion to the &s;oul, and rectifies the inward principle of chu&s;ing, and turns power of election another way. It unde|ceives the &s;oul, and &s;ets it free of that deceitful &s;en&s;e of liberty which directed its choice the wrong way. This powerful per&s;ua&s;ion inclines that power we call the will, to take in purity and holine&s;s into the notion of goodne&s;s. This determines the &s;oul to chu&s;e not only what is relatively good, but what is really &s;o.</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t not at the &s;ame time imagine that any finite being hath an independent liberty, for this would put them out of the order of creatures, and equal them with their Creator: So the free&s;t choice men can be &s;uppo&s;ed to have, is a choice to be a &s;ervant under him whom he acknowledgeth to be his God. When man departed from his Ma|ker's &s;ervice, he then denied him to be his &s;upreme ma&s;ter, and cho&s;e another who is called the god of this world. Then his liberty was dependent upon the will of his new god, which he had now &s;ubmit|ted unto. He now had a will and liberty to do the rever&s;e of what he had done before, becau&s;e he acknowledged his dependence upon another lord, who&s;e &s;ervice is very different from that of his fir&s;t ma&s;ter. We then mu&s;t conclude that the human will is free, dependently upon the ma&s;ter it is under. There is no &s;uch liberty in the will as to allow it to &s;erve two ma&s;ters; our Lord tells us this is <HI>im|po&s;&s;ible; ye cannot &s;erve two ma&s;ters.</HI> For when men are free as to one &s;overeign, they are in &s;ubjection to another. There is indeed a power in the mind
<PB N="188" REF="196">of man to change its ma&s;ter, but this is effected by per&s;ua&s;ion, as at fir&s;t, when <HI>Satan</HI> per&s;uaded our fir&s;t parents to change their God, and &s;ubmit to him. Our Lord, who has all authority to &s;ave men, when he changes their will, does the rever&s;e of what the Devil did at fir&s;t per&s;uade them, to <HI>return to their fir&s;t ma&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>HE who has <HI>the keys of hell and death,</HI> per&s;uades and enables his cho&s;en ones to u&s;e their natural li|berty the right way: <HI>For whom the &s;on maketh free, they are free indeed.</HI> And this he doth by making the key of per&s;ua&s;ion reach their heart. The li|berty which men enjoy in a &s;tate of &s;in and mi&s;ery, is comparative &s;lavery when oppo&s;ed to that free|dom that the <HI>citizens of the &s;aints</HI> enjoy. Though they have their own choice, it is mi&s;ery to have it, when it proves their hurt. But <HI>Je&s;us</HI> makes his people chu&s;e what is purely good, and enables them to &s;ay of <HI>God's commandments, that in all things they are right.</HI> This choice is not effected by force, for the will cannot be forced; for all compul&s;ion de|&s;troys choice, but is effected by per&s;ua&s;ion. <HI>Je&s;us</HI> our Lord, <HI>who hath the keys of hell and death,</HI> gains the con&s;ent of the heart, by the charms of truth, in which he holds forth his own excellencies, and graciou&s;ly draws and inclines that power we call the will. Conver&s;ion is not violence committed upon human liberty, nor a driving men by force from <HI>Satan</HI>'s kingdom; <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> receives none but &s;uch as he makes truly willing. The word of the go&s;pel con&s;trains &s;inners by the &s;weetne&s;s of its call, and draws them into a liking of it&s;elf and the objects it propo&s;es, by &s;hewing how agreeable they are to that condition it finds men in. For this rea&s;on it is called <HI>a joyful &s;ound.</HI> P&s;al. lxxxix. 15. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are the people who know the joyful &s;ound.</HI> The go&s;pel is an addre&s;s to con&s;cience, which, if you will, you may call the moral &s;en&s;e, and operates upon it as
<PB N="189" REF="197">agreeable mu&s;ic doth upon our &s;en&s;e of hearing. When a &s;kilful mu&s;ician plays well, he will gain the approbation of our ear, tho' we had no de&s;ign to be charmed with his mu&s;ic; yet we cannot re|fu&s;e the approbation that our plea&s;ure in the mu&s;ic obligeth us to give. We cannot at the &s;ame time &s;ay that we are forced, becau&s;e our approbation flows from plea&s;ure. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of a beautiful picture, where variety and unity meet to plea&s;e; we cannot refu&s;e our approbation, for the plea&s;ure ari&s;ing from the &s;en&s;e of &s;eeing produceth it; yet we cannot &s;ay that there is any force put upon us, but beauty charms us into approbation. <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> when he gains the approbation and con&s;ent of the &s;oul, makes his word produce the &s;ame effects upon our moral part, that the&s;e do to our &s;en&s;itive part, and charms the &s;oul into an approbation of his own excellencies.</P>
<P>JESUS CHRIST, <HI>who has the power of hell and death,</HI> removes the enmity of the heart by the key of love. By this Divine principle he opens the hard heart, and rai&s;es the affections <HI>to things that are above.</HI> The love of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> con&s;trains the &s;oul to obedience, and removes that enmity that is op|po&s;ite to the law of God. Enmity in the heart makes a &s;trong re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the&s;e tender &s;en|timents that ought to fill the brea&s;t of every good and virtuous man; like a ru&s;ty &s;pring it oppo&s;es the motions of the Spirit of love, till overcome by that &s;uperior principle. This Divine principle melts the &s;oul, and opens the avenues to the heart, till at la&s;t it is made to &s;ay with the church, <HI>Thy love is better than wine.</HI> Men are naturally dead to all the tender &s;entiments of love and true affec|tion to God, and what is truly good; but our Re|deemer, <HI>who has power over hell and death,</HI> opens the heart to receive the tender &s;entiments and im|pre&s;&s;ions of love, and enables the &s;oul to yield obe|dience
<PB N="190" REF="198">to that precept; <HI>My &s;on give me thine heart.</HI> This love is like oil to all the &s;prings of motion and action in the &s;oul: It relaxes the whole mind, and makes it pliable to the will of God. This truly Divine principle makes men like God, <HI>good and gentle to all men,</HI> and removes that &s;ourne&s;s which wicked ob&s;tinacy had fixed in the moral con&s;titu|tion. It forms the &s;oul into the likene&s;s of God, who&s;e character is <HI>Love.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. HE who has <HI>power over hell and death,</HI> &s;ets limits and bounds to the wrath of his people's ene|mies, and re&s;trains all the violence of their &s;piritual foes: Hence the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> &s;ays, <HI>The wrath of man &s;hall prai&s;e thee, the remainder of wrath &s;halt thou re&s;train.</HI> The enemies of the &s;aints may make them afraid, but they cannot de&s;troy them. They may really form very deadly plots again&s;t them, which if they were carried into execution, would i&s;&s;ue in their ruin and de&s;truction; but as <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is <HI>their Lord and King,</HI> the Admini&s;trator of the Covenant of grace, and hath all power committed unto him for his people's good and advantage, &s;o he exerts it for their deliverance. The de&s;igns of devils and wicked men may be deeply laid, their purpo&s;es of wickedne&s;s well concerted, and no di|ligence wanting to execute them; but he who hath <HI>the keys of hell and death,</HI> di&s;concerts their mea&s;ures, and overturns all their &s;chemes. When the chil|dren of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> were &s;hut up between <HI>Migdol</HI> and the &s;ea, <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and his ho&s;t &s;eemed well &s;atisfied in their own minds, that they were able either to give them a total overthrow, or to bring them back again to <HI>Egypt</HI> to keep them in bondage: They had al&s;o the &s;entence of death within them&s;elves, and were very much afraid. But their Divine go|vernor bounded the malice of their enemies, and by a turn of the key of his power and providence, &s;hut up the <HI>Egyptians</HI> in the pri&s;on of the depth;
<PB N="191" REF="199">and by another exertion of his power, opened a way for his people to pa&s;s &s;afely <HI>through the flood on foot.</HI> Often the true fearers of God are &s;o be&s;et with their powerful enemies, that to all human probability there is no way left for their e&s;cape, and were it not that their Redeemer is <HI>mighty, and ready to &s;ave them,</HI> nothing could pre&s;erve them. Sometimes it mo&s;t eminently appears that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;ets bounds to the fury of his people's enemies, when nothing but his Divine power could re&s;cue them out of the &s;nares that are laid for them. The turning of the key of providence is &s;o vi&s;ible, <HI>that he that runs may read it;</HI> then it is evident that the Lord's right|hand <HI>brings &s;alvation</HI> to them. When temptations are &s;o laid, &s;o &s;uited to the inclinations of men, that they are ready to fall in with them every mo|ment, the goodne&s;s of God either removes the ob|ject, or fortifies the mind again&s;t the temptation, quite contrary to their expectation. And even when the chri&s;tian is mo&s;t treacherou&s;ly betrayed by his &s;piritual foes, and as it were &s;hut up like a pri&s;oner in the mid&s;t of a party of the prince of darkne&s;s's auxiliaries, contrary to his &s;tated inclination; he who has <HI>the keys of hell and death,</HI> opens an effectual door of deliverance, <HI>and re&s;tores the &s;oul again for his name &s;ake.</HI> He brings the &s;oul thus di&s;tre&s;&s;ed <HI>out of the horrible pit, and out of the miry clay, and &s;ets it upon a rock, and e&s;tabli&s;hes its goings.</HI> This he doth by turning its inclinations, by the power of his grace, and inclining the mind more re&s;olutely to follow that which is good, holy, and pure. In this he &s;hews that he hath <HI>the keys of hell and death.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. HE limits their trials that ari&s;e from the enemies of religion, and the powers of darkne&s;s. There is a nece&s;&s;ity that chri&s;tians have trials, to make them learn <HI>hardne&s;s, as good &s;oldiers of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> So <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> their Lord and Saviour, permits the&s;e; but he &s;ets limits unto them that they cannot
<PB N="192" REF="200">go beyond his will: <HI>The heathen may rage, and the people imagine a vain thing; but he that &s;its in heaven &s;hall laugh at them, the Lord &s;hall hold them in de|ri&s;ion. He hath &s;et his king upon his holy hill of Zion,</HI> and <HI>given him all power in heaven and earth,</HI> for the advantage of his church and people. Tho' he &s;ometimes lets loo&s;e the enemies of his church a little, he &s;till keeps the keys in his own hand, and limits their power, that they cannot go beyond the &s;et bounds. He makes u&s;e of <HI>the powers of hell and death</HI> to cha&s;ti&s;e his children, but keeps them &s;till under his own dominion and power.</P>
<P>THE Redeemer may lengthen out their chain, but never lets them altogether loo&s;e: By his power he again re&s;trains them, and &s;huts them up in con|finement. He makes them, contrary to their in|tentions, work good to his &s;ervants. Neither <HI>prin|cipalities nor powers</HI> can go beyond the will of him who has <HI>the keys of hell and death.</HI> Death it&s;elf acts only a friendly part to the children of God: The Redeemer makes u&s;e of death as a key to open a door to let the &s;aints into heaven, &s;o that what in it&s;elf is mo&s;t awful, the admini&s;tration of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> makes mo&s;t profitable and advantageous to tho&s;e who fear him. By his death he hath di&s;|armed death of its &s;ting, that it cannot really hurt any who belong to him. And tho' he may make u&s;e of it, for a trial and exerci&s;e to good men, even in that re&s;pect he makes it turn out to their ad|vantage. That per&s;ua&s;ion made the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> triumph over death, 1 Cor. xv. 55. <HI>O death, where</HI> is <HI>thy &s;ting? O grave, where</HI> is <HI>thy victory? The &s;ting of death</HI> is <HI>&s;in; and the &s;trength of &s;in</HI> is <HI>the law. But thanks</HI> be <HI>to God, that giveth us the victory, through our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Head 2d, To &s;hew how much the chri&s;tian's comfort dependeth upon a right under&s;tand|ing
<PB N="193" REF="201">of this admini&s;tration of our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> in his exalted &s;tate.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE knowledge of this, makes them &s;ee the po&s;&s;ibility of doing their duty. The &s;trict and holy prcepts of God's law, point out duties far a|bove the natural &s;trength of any fallen creature; and when men con&s;ider the perfection of this holy rule of righteou&s;ne&s;s, they are ready to think that it is impo&s;&s;ible for them to ob&s;erve all or any of its precepts; and indeed it is truly impo&s;&s;ible for any imperfect man to ob&s;erve them right. When|ever the believer con&s;iders this, and cannot find liberty in his own mind to neglect them, and finds no power to perform them, the under&s;tanding of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s admini&s;tration, as a head of Divine influ|ences, joyfully removes the difficulty. When be|lievers con&s;ider him as the fountain of all grace and &s;trength, no duty &s;eems either heavy or impo&s;&s;ible; but with <HI>Paul,</HI> they will &s;ay, <HI>We can do all things through Chri&s;t that &s;trengtheneth us.</HI> There is not the lea&s;t po&s;&s;ibility when chri&s;tians look to them&s;elves that ever they &s;hall di&s;charge one obligation they lie under, nor can they find how to di&s;charge their con&s;ciences of the obligation: But when they un|der&s;tand that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is exalted <HI>to give power to them that have no might,</HI> and to enable them <HI>both to will and to do of his good plea&s;ure,</HI> they &s;ee not only a po&s;&s;ibility, but a certainty of di&s;charging their duty in his &s;trength.</P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> were at the waters of <HI>Jor|dan,</HI> they could not learn how to an&s;wer the com|mandment, to go <HI>over to the promi&s;ed land,</HI> till they under&s;tood the Divine admini&s;tration, by <HI>the ark and the prie&s;ts going before them.</HI> But what was im|po&s;&s;ible to their &s;en&s;e, was certain and ea&s;y to their faith; and when they under&s;tood that God was en|gaged to defend them, and had promi&s;ed to bring them into that land, they were encouraged to go
<PB N="194" REF="202">forward in the confidence of &s;ucceeding. When the Moral Law binds to &s;ome very important duty, and providence calls us to di&s;charge it, but no in|ward di&s;po&s;ition &s;eems to incline us thereto, what could we do but &s;uccumb at the thought, were it not by attempting we are a&s;&s;ured of the promi&s;e to bear us thro'. The true chri&s;tian is encouraged to go on, becau&s;e <HI>his King is upon his head,</HI> and hath promi&s;ed to <HI>give him grace, and withold no good thing from him</HI> when he needs it.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE knowledge of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s admini&s;tration affords to believers a view of the end of all their cro&s;&s;es and afflictions. If <HI>Je&s;us</HI> be the admini&s;trator of the New Covenant, in his exalted &s;tate, for the benefit of his people here below in the mid&s;t of their enemies, then as he is a&s;cended above all cro&s;&s;es and troubles, as <HI>their Lord and head,</HI> they have rea&s;on to believe that he will deliver them out of all their afflictions al&s;o: His promi&s;e they may &s;afely depend upon, <HI>for he will not leave them till he hath done what he hath &s;poken to them of.</HI> He hath promi&s;ed <HI>that if they &s;uffer with him, they &s;hall al&s;o reign with him.</HI> As Chri&s;t is appointed to manage the whole concerns of his church and chil|dren, &s;o his honour is engaged to bring them all to a happy i&s;&s;ue. The under&s;tanding of this mu&s;t certainly be very comforting to every chri&s;tian; for hereby they are a&s;&s;ured of a ble&s;&s;ed deliverance from all trouble. Tho' trials may be heavy in the mean time, yet the certainty of &s;afe deliverance out of them at la&s;t, will make men bear them with more patience, and will &s;upport the minds altho' much oppre&s;&s;ed otherwi&s;e. It is &s;uch an under|&s;tanding that makes pre&s;ent afflictions &s;eem light, and made the Apo&s;tle account his &s;uffering but light; &s;ays he, <HI>Our light afflictions are but for a mo|ment, and work for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. Chri&s;t</HI> in his &s;ufferings was an ex|ample
<PB N="195" REF="203">to his di&s;ciples and followers, as well as the procuring cau&s;e of their happine&s;s; and he, when he <HI>had fini&s;hed his &s;ufferings, entered into his glory.</HI> To make his people follow his glorious example with patience, he reveals unto them in his word, that the de&s;ign of his admini&s;tration is to put an end to their &s;ufferings and cro&s;&s;es, as he hath got beyond all his.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE under&s;tanding of this admini&s;tration of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> gives the chri&s;tian a view of the end of his faith and obedience. Dependence upon God, and obedience to his law, would not be a rea&s;onable &s;ervice, unle&s;s &s;ome end were propo&s;ed in depending upon, and obeying <HI>Jehovah.</HI> While men are ignorant of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and the character he &s;u&s;tains, as the admini&s;trator of the New Cove|nant, they remain ignorant of the end of men's de|pendence upon God. Hence it happens that &s;elf-dependence &s;upplies the room of our dependence upon our Maker, and all the end that men in this condition propo&s;e to them&s;elves, is &s;elf. Their own honour, intere&s;t and plea&s;ure, are &s;ub&s;tituted in the room of the will and plea&s;ure of the God of truth. As they know not the rea&s;on of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s exaltation, they have no dependence upon him, &s;o they walk on in the forbidden path of pride and &s;elf-dependence: After all, they have no certainty of attaining to the end they propo&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> &s;atisfaction from the objects they pur&s;ue, but are often mortified with di&s;appointments and lo&s;&s;es, as to tho&s;e things they had chiefly in view; &s;o they lo&s;e their end.</P>
<P>BUT the true believer who is acquainted with <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> as the Admini&s;trator of the Covenant of Grace, &s;ees the end of his faith and dependence upon him in the true&s;t and cleare&s;t point of view. The end of faith and dependence upon God is, to give him all the glory in our &s;alvation; and with reference unto us, it is the &s;alvation of our &s;ouls.
<PB N="196" REF="204">That we &s;hall attain to this, we are only certain from our fir&s;t knowing what relation <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> &s;tands in to us. When we once come to the un|der&s;tanding that he is the <HI>author and fini&s;her of our faith,</HI> we come al&s;o to &s;ome certainty according to the mea&s;ure of our under&s;tanding, that we &s;hall at|tain to the end that is propo&s;ed to our dependence on God. The want of, or the weakne&s;s of our faith, ari&s;es from the want of, or weakne&s;s of our under&s;tanding of the end thereof: For no man who labours without having the under&s;tanding of the end and rea&s;on of his &s;ervice, will have any true plea&s;ure in his exerci&s;e. The believer in <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> who knows that he is <HI>exalted,</HI> to di&s;pen&s;e Divine grace and power to his people, is per&s;uaded he &s;hall not fall &s;hort of his end: For his Redeemer <HI>will not forget his work and labour of love.</HI> When men's cro&s;&s;es are many and heavy, their trials beyond their ordinary &s;trength, they can hardly &s;ee any rea&s;on to conclude that they &s;hould attain to the end they fir&s;t propo&s;ed to their faith in <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> were they not per&s;uaded that he will even make the&s;e turn out to their good, and bring them nearer to the end of their faith. It affords the greate&s;t comfort to the children of God to <HI>know that their Redeemer liveth,</HI> and is appointed to take care of their intere&s;ts, when they them&s;elves are in their wor&s;t circum&s;tances. By contemplating his charac|ter, as the Lord who hath <HI>the keys of hell and death,</HI> they are enabled to forget all things but one; and to &s;ay in the language of the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t, One thing have I de&s;ired of the Lord, and that will I &s;eek after, that all the days of my life I may dwell in the hou&s;e of the Lord,</HI> to behold his beauty.</P>
<P>THERE are few, if any enterpri&s;es, that any finite creature can perfect in an in&s;tant, to &s;ay no|thing of weak debilitated creatures like men. There is therefore need of &s;trength and &s;upport, to carry
<PB N="197" REF="205">on a work, in order to have it fini&s;hed. He who engages in a &s;ervice, in hope of having his reward, will at the &s;ame time have little ground for his hope, unle&s;s he have &s;ecurity for the&s;e nece&s;&s;ary things that are needful to &s;upport him during the time of his &s;ervice. It will con&s;iderably animate him in his obedience to his ma&s;ter's commands, to be certified that he &s;hall be well &s;upplied with all nece&s;&s;ary things during the time of his &s;ervice.</P>
<P>WHEN chri&s;tians have the certain knowledge that their Redeemer is appointed and authori&s;ed to give them all needful &s;upplies of grace and &s;trength while they are in this world, they can then &s;ee the end of <HI>their faith, and labour of love,</HI> as a cer|tain and &s;ure thing. To all oppo&s;ition and temp|tations, their reply is ready, <HI>I can do all things thro' Chri&s;t that &s;trengtheneth me: I know he will keep that which I have committed to him again&s;t that day.</HI> In the mid&s;t of all wants and weakne&s;s, wanderings and back&s;lidings, the chri&s;tian can &s;ay, <HI>The Lord is my &s;hepherd, I &s;hall not want. He re&s;toreth my &s;oul again, and cau&s;eth me to walk in the paths of righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, for his name &s;ake. He will perfect what con|cerneth me.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. THE knowledge of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s admini&s;tration, as ve&s;ted with all power and authority for the hap|pine&s;s of his people, affords them a certain evidence that they &s;hall enjoy a glorious reward in another life. When men confine their views merely to the analogy of nature, or what notions they have of God from that analogy, they will remain &s;till ignorant of what is to happen in the life to come. That there is any reward to virtue beyond the grave, is probable, but not certain from any di&s;coveries of natural religion: For God may, for any thing we know from natural principles, termi|nate our exi&s;tence with our death. Neither is it contrary to his character, not to reward our &s;ervices
<PB N="198" REF="206">with immortality, when they are not in their highe&s;t perfection, worthy of &s;uch a reward as eternal life and immortal glory. The whole &s;um of the argu|ments taken and u&s;ed from natural religion, comes to this, <Q>That virtue be rewarded according to &startq;its proportion, or men receive the ju&s;t reward &endq;of their works.</Q> But it will be hard to prove according to any principle of natural religion, that any human &s;ervice de&s;erves an eternal and immor|tal life of bli&s;s and happine&s;s. And as for future puni&s;hments for mi&s;deeds, the knowledge of their eternity ari&s;es al&s;o from revelation, not from na|tural religion: For it will be very difficult to find from thence, that an action of a finite creature de|&s;erves eternal torment. E&s;pecially if we cannot find any expre&s;s law or precept that they have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed. The greate&s;t length we can go on this point is, to judge from feeling, and to e&s;timate the Divine conduct from our fears, as in the former ca&s;e we do from our hopes; whereas for want of the determined purpo&s;e of his will, we are uncertain but both are delu&s;ory. The mo&s;t which can be &s;aid of all the arguments u&s;ed upon this &s;ubject, from what is called Natural Religion is, that they are probable, but do not ab&s;olutly a&s;certain the truth.</P>
<P>BUT the knowledge of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Divine admini|&s;tration in the go&s;pel, gives us certainty of a ble&s;&s;ed and glorious reward <HI>laid up for them that fear God. Chri&s;t</HI> is appointed the ble&s;&s;ed tru&s;tee of all good things in this life, <HI>for tho&s;e that fear him,</HI> and the great judge and di&s;tributor of glory in the next: <HI>I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me.</HI> When we are certain of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s appointment <HI>to give grace and glory,</HI> and of his good intentions for this pur|po&s;e, we have all the certainty we could wi&s;h, that &s;uch as believe in him &s;hall be rewarded with eter|nal life, in the full enjoyment of God for ever: For <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> hath promi&s;ed to his di&s;ciples, <HI>Becau&s;e I
<PB N="199" REF="207">live, ye &s;hall live al&s;o. I will come again and take you to my&s;elf, that where I am, ye may be al&s;o.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>la&s;t</HI> thing in the method was to make &s;ome improvement.</P>
<P N="1">1. WE may &s;ee a door of hope for believers in their wor&s;t circum&s;tances. The chri&s;tian may be &s;urrounded with many enemies, and the&s;e the mo&s;t powerful; yet when he looks to him who hath <HI>the keys of hell and death,</HI> he beholds &s;alvation and de|liverance at hand. Tho' all human probability &s;hould &s;peak the contrary, and the believer &s;hould &s;ee no way of e&s;cape; yet as &s;oon as he con&s;iders him, <HI>who openeth what none can &s;hut,</HI> he &s;ees <HI>the day of his redemption drawing near.</HI></P>
<P>THOUGH it may happen that a good man's enemies may really &s;eem to have him in their power, that all concurring circum&s;tances may out|wardly agree to favour their de&s;igns, as was the ca&s;e with <HI>David</HI> when <HI>Saul</HI> hunted him around the mountains; and when all was taken from him, and the people &s;pake of &s;toning him; yet they never altogether want hope, <HI>but encourage them&s;elves in their God.</HI> And this hope of believers is well founded, and never fails them, nor di&s;appoints them. The experience of the &s;aints can bear witne&s;s, that <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> their Almighty Lord, effects their de|liverance, when all human wi&s;dom would have de&s;|paired of deliverance: <HI>When all refuge fails them, and no man takes care for their &s;ouls, Je&s;us</HI> re&s;cues them from the hands of their enemies, <HI>according to bis wi&s;dom and good purpo&s;e concerning them.</HI> Tho' &s;nares may be cunningly laid, and deep coun&s;els taken again&s;t the friends of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> he di&s;concerts the&s;e de&s;igns, <HI>breaks the &s;nares,</HI> and his people e|&s;cape. When great power is joined with deep ar|tifice, and to all appearance re&s;i&s;tance is vain; yet then the Lord breaks the power of his &s;aints' foes, as he did that of <HI>Pharaoh</HI> in the deep: <HI>Their Re|deemer
<PB N="200" REF="208">is mighty, the Lord of Ho&s;ts is his name.</HI> Tho' <HI>Satan</HI> may have his temptations well &s;uited to the natural con&s;titution of the chri&s;tian, and a|dapted every way to his natural temper, that to all probability he mu&s;t fall before the &s;tratagem, and be caught in the &s;nare; yet he who keeps <HI>the keys of hell and death, with the temptation al&s;o, finds out a way of e&s;cape,</HI> by either fortifying the mind with &s;trength, or removing the temptation: He breaks the helli&s;h inchantment, and &s;ets his people free. This the church acknowledgeth in her experience, P&s;al. cxxiv. <HI>Had not the Lord been upon our &s;ide, when our enemies ro&s;e up again&s;t us, they had over|whelmed us: our &s;oul had &s;unk beneath the &s;tream. But the &s;nare is broken, and we have e&s;caped.</HI> A view of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Divine admini&s;tration, as the King and Lord of his church, opens a glorious door of hope, when all other comfort and hope is gone: The believer is like <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI>'s &s;ervant, when the Lord opened his eyes, &s;ees God for his defence, <HI>like chariots of fire, and hor&s;es of fire</HI> to protect him. The right under&s;tanding of our Lord's admini&s;tra|tion, in his exalted &s;tate, among his people here below in the mid&s;t of their enemies, enables them <HI>to hope again&s;t hope,</HI> and affords them &s;atisfaction contrary to all human probability. Tho' like <HI>Job</HI> they have no worldly comfort, they rejoice in this, <HI>that their Redeemer liveth.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. SEE the de&s;ign of all Divine ordinances and in&s;titutions. It is to render homage to <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> as the only King and Head of his church. <HI>John</HI>'s letters to the &s;even churches of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> are prefaced with &s;ome &s;triking evidences of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s power and head&s;hip, and the force of all the duties the&s;e churches are exhorted to, is derived from his royal character, as, <HI>He who liveth, and was dead, and is alive for evermore, Amen; and hath the keys of hell and death.</HI> All ordinances are mi&s;applied that
<PB N="201" REF="209">are not thus directed. Whatever ordinances in the church are not immediately derived from his authority, are will-wor&s;hip and &s;uper&s;tition. All homage mu&s;t be paid to him <HI>who hath the keys of hell and death.</HI> In our improvement of every or|dinance, we mu&s;t keep this in our eye, otherwi&s;e we mi&s;improve the in&s;titutions of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and put them out of their true order. This ordinance of our Lord's Supper, which we are called this day to celebrate, mu&s;t be ob&s;erved in the way of paying homage to him, <HI>who hath the keys of hell and death:</HI> This duty is founded upon his royal commandment, <HI>Do this in remembrance of me;</HI> and <HI>where the word of a King is, there is power.</HI> Tho' our Redeemer hath conde&s;cended &s;o far as to admit worms of his foot|&s;tool to eat and drink in his pre&s;ence, yet they ought to remember in who&s;e pre&s;ence they are: And con&s;ider in the mo&s;t intimate communion with him, there ought to be the deepe&s;t humility, as an homage due to him. The communicants about the throne, <HI>ca&s;t their crowns from their heads,</HI> is to|ken of their willingne&s;s to pay him homage; and communicants here below mu&s;t remember the &s;ame is due from them.</P>
<P>It is an evidence he de&s;erves our deepe&s;t reve|rence and greate&s;t homage, becau&s;e he is the au|thor of this ordinance, and all the enjoyments we have in it, is his free gift; all that his friends enjoy in the &s;acrament of the &s;upper is of his providing: He gives them all things in this communion freely and liberally. The homage that is due unto him is thank&s;giving, for all his true friends and &s;ubjects are under an obligation to prai&s;e him: To &s;ay with the church, <HI>We will take the cup of &s;alvation, and call upon the name of the Lord: we will pay our vows unto the Lord, in the pre&s;ence of all his people:</HI> We will pay homage to him that hath <HI>the keys of hell and death.</HI></P>
<PB N="202" REF="210">
<P N="3">3. LEARN the &s;ecurity of the believer's hap|pine&s;s. It is &s;ecured in the hands of him that hath <HI>the keys of hell and death;</HI> who is intru&s;ted with all their concerns. If <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> is intru&s;ted with the &s;alvation and happine&s;s of his &s;aints, then they mu&s;t be &s;aved, for he is <HI>both able and willing</HI> to do it. That he is able, our text is a certain proof; for he hath <HI>the keys of hell and death, he opens and none can &s;hut, he &s;hutteth and none can open.</HI> That he is willing, the revelation of him as well qualified for that end is a te&s;timony. This character of our Redeemer would afford but little comfort to his people, if &s;in or <HI>Satan,</HI> or any cau&s;e whatever could hinder their &s;alvation. Could the prince of dark|ne&s;s wre&s;t <HI>the keys of hell and death</HI> out of his hand, <HI>Who then could be &s;aved?</HI> Neither would homage be due to him if he had not infinite power and per|fection. But as he hath all power in heaven and in earth, he enjoys it for his people's good and ad|vantage, and is di&s;po&s;ed to apply it for their eter|nal comfort. Therefore they are &s;ecured in peace and happine&s;s, through him who is their head in heaven. He is for their eternal comfort and &s;e|curity, inve&s;ted with full power to do and act for them; as <HI>he hath the keys of hell and death,</HI> none can &s;hut heaven, or open hell but him&s;elf: For <HI>he lives for evermore, and hath the keys of hell and death.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. FROM what has been &s;aid, we have rea&s;on to exhort you, who intend to join in this holy or|dinance of our Lord's &s;upper, <HI>To &s;et your affections upon things that are above, where Chri&s;t &s;itteth at the right-hand of God.</HI> Tho' you have his death and humiliation repre&s;ented in this ordinance, yet you ought to con&s;ider it as a thing pa&s;t: He who was <HI>dead is now alive,</HI> and <HI>&s;itteth at the right hand of the maje&s;ty on high, and has the keys of hell and death</HI> in his power; or according to the words of the angel, <HI>He is not here, but is ri&s;en: See the place where the Lord
<PB N="203" REF="211">lay.</HI> The te&s;timony you have of him in the word, ought to lead up your hearts to him in his exalted &s;tate; and while you commemorate his death, you ought not to forget, that he is <HI>entered into his glory.</HI> The &s;ymbols of his broken body and &s;hed blood, ought to put you in mind of his wonderful love, in meriting life for you, but not to confine your attention to the literal part of this ordinance. The de&s;ign of this &s;acrament is to direct the &s;oul to him in the way of prai&s;e and thank&s;giving. He left it in the church as a pledge of his love, and we ought to u&s;e it as &s;uch, to bring to our remembrance, him <HI>who loved us, and gave him&s;elf for us.</HI> If you would enjoy communion with him, you mu&s;t look thro' the &s;igns to the thing &s;ignified; con&s;ider the mean|ing and de&s;ign of this ordinance. In this life our knowledge and enjoyment of God, is in general &s;ymbolically conveyed unto us, for we are not yet capacitated to receive it immediately. Reading and hearing are but &s;ymbols whereby the know|ledge of God is conveyed to men: For knowledge it&s;elf con&s;i&s;ts not in either &s;ounds or letters: They only are &s;ymbols or &s;hort hierogliphics to convey to our minds what they are u&s;ed to &s;ignify. The <HI>ele|ments of bread and wine,</HI> are much of the &s;ame nature, in the &s;en&s;e they ought to be u&s;ed. They are ano|ther kind of language taken to expre&s;s the death of <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> or we may call them big characters, ex|pre&s;&s;ing the love of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> our Redeemer. They ought therefore to be u&s;ed as means to rai&s;e our love and affections to <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>BEWARE of &s;uffering any object to come be|tween your heart and that Saviour, which ought to occupy your whole affections. If any object what|ever have <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s ju&s;t room in your heart, you will have no communion with him in that ordinance. If either pride, &s;elf, or worldly-mindedne&s;s, have the a&s;cendant in your hearts, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> will allow you
<PB N="204" REF="212">no fellow&s;hip with him; you will then eat and drink <HI>judgment</HI> to your own &s;ouls. I am &s;orry to &s;ay that I ob&s;erve &s;ome, who in the general part of their conduct, &s;erve <HI>Mammon</HI> more than God, and &s;elf more than <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> pre&s;umptuou&s;ly ap|proach to this holy ordinance. You ought bre|thren to remember, tho' we have no warrant to keep you back, you have no right to be there, becau&s;e <HI>your hearts are not right with God.</HI> You cannot <HI>&s;erve two ma&s;ters;</HI> God will not accept of a divided heart, for he requires the whole affections to him&s;elf. If you approach to this holy ordinance with your hearts full of covetou&s;ne&s;s and oppre&s;&s;ion, remember the condition and treatment of the man who had not on <HI>the wedding garment:</HI> The Lord of this ordinance will &s;ay unto you, <HI>Friend, how came&s;t thou hither, not having on the wedding garment.</HI> God will mo&s;t &s;everely puni&s;h &s;uch audacious &s;inners. Think not that your outward form of Godline&s;s, will cover you from the eye of him who &s;eeth all things; for no|thing can be hid from him at any time. He &s;ees things pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, and to come, by one glance of his Divine intelligence, and is <HI>a di&s;cerner of the thoughts of the heart:</HI> Fear then to approach his &s;acred pre&s;ence in &s;uch a &s;olemn manner, le&s;t he pour out his fury upon you.</P>
<P>BE exhorted to lay a&s;ide all malice and wicked|ne&s;s, le&s;t you provoke <HI>Jehovah</HI> to di&s;charge the thunder-bolts of his vengeance upon you. It doth not become men to approach to this ordinance, where love only ought to have the chief place, with malice in their hearts again&s;t any per&s;on, friend or enemy. Let all unmercifulne&s;s be rooted out of your &s;ouls, before you come to commemorate that great expre&s;&s;ion of Divine mercy, the death of <HI>Chri&s;t:</HI> It will be a heinous abu&s;e of the mercy of God, for any cruel unmerciful man to make &s;o free with what he is forbidden to approach: The <HI>leaven
<PB N="205" REF="213">of wickedne&s;s</HI> mu&s;t be put out of the &s;oul, if you would lawfully eat the Chri&s;tian Pa&s;&s;over.</P>
<P>ENDEAVOUR to get free of all &s;elfi&s;h princi|ples, and be di&s;intere&s;ted in your religious conduct. Let not political rea&s;ons govern your views in ob|&s;erving the ordinances of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</HI> ob&s;erve them becau&s;e he hath appointed them. Take &s;pecial care that you ob&s;erve them, <HI>not to be &s;een of men,</HI> or to &s;erve the purpo&s;e of &s;elf and the world. It is much to be lamented, that the profe&s;&s;ors of the truth make it a &s;econdary thing in practice, which they pretend to place fir&s;t in words. One who will &s;peak well of religion, and pretend a good deal to its experience, at lea&s;t would be offended not to be accounted a true chri&s;tian, will, notwith&s;tanding, neglect &s;ome or all of its duties for a very &s;mall mea&s;ure of worldly intere&s;t. What is this but to tell the world and their own con&s;ciences, they are hypocrites who never had religion at heart. Should I &s;ay, that I know there are &s;uch among our ordi|nary communicants, I might perhaps offend &s;ome; but &s;ome con&s;ciences here pre&s;ent know I would &s;ay the truth. When men neglect preparation for &s;uch &s;olemn exerci&s;es, and ra&s;hly and pre&s;umptu|ou&s;ly approach to the table of the Lord, it is a &s;trong evidence they are near to practical athei&s;m: For if they believed the Omni&s;cience of God, and his pure holy character, they would not dare to approach his pre&s;ence in &s;uch a &s;olemn manner, without attempt|ing the preparation required of chri&s;tian wor&s;hip|pers. When I ob&s;erve with what ceremony &s;ome per&s;ons will endeavour to prepare them&s;elves, to addre&s;s a &s;uperior, who&s;e approbation they would wi&s;h to have, or who&s;e aid they intend to a&s;k; and how little diligence they u&s;e to prepare them&s;elves to addre&s;s the Almighty, I cannot but believe they do not know his character, or have no de&s;ire for his approbation.</P>
<PB N="206" REF="214">
<P>CERTAINLY no man who knows the nature and character of God, but will &s;ee how pre&s;umptu|ous it is to approach his &s;acred pre&s;ence, without endeavouring to have &s;uch &s;entiments as are worthy of his Maje&s;ty and Holine&s;s. But, alas! we &s;ee too often the worms of his foot&s;tool pre&s;umptuou&s;ly make u&s;e of the &s;acred &s;ymbols of the body and blood of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> without the lea&s;t vi&s;ible prepara|tion. What is the language of &s;uch conduct, but <HI>that God doth not &s;ee, the Almighty doth not con&s;ider,</HI> what way men approach unto him? Allow me to addre&s;s two &s;orts of per&s;ons who perhaps may at|tempt to communicate on this occa&s;ion: Fir&s;t, I|dolaters, for too many of this character there are, I am afraid, among tho&s;e who bear the Chri&s;tian Name. I mean not wor&s;hippers of &s;tocks and &s;tones, but &s;uch as have idols in their hearts, which &s;upplant their Saviour. You who adore the godde&s;s of fame, and mean no more by being religious, but to &s;upport a name among men, &s;uffer me to &s;ay, you will be unworthy communicants. This is a piece of &s;elf you ought to deny; for if you are un|der the influence of this principle, it is your God, and will exterminate all &s;erious and judicious thoughts of the Mo&s;t High. It is an evidence of your &s;piritual death, <HI>that you are dead while you live.</HI> When you &s;eek after no more of religion than is needful to rai&s;e your character in the world among good men: This is like <HI>Laodicea, to have a name to live, while yet you are dead.</HI> You are only in this pe&s;pect idolaters, wor&s;hippers of fame, in&s;tead of the true God. You who adore the world, &s;o far as to &s;et your hearts upon it, and &s;tudy more to encrea&s;e your wealth, than encrea&s;e your faith, you are idol|aters, that are &s;ure to be unworthy communicants. The man who has neither peace in his mind, nor quietne&s;s in his family, but when the world is flow|ing in upon him; who is troubled to exce&s;s at the
<PB N="207" REF="215">will of Providence, when any thing happens to his worldly di&s;advantage; who frets for the lo&s;s of a few pounds, as if God was departed from him; who vexes him&s;elf and all his concerns, at the de|cline of bu&s;ine&s;s, or decay of trade, is undoubtedly a wor&s;hipper of <HI>Mammon,</HI> and a gro&s;s-heart idola|ter; and if he approach to this holy ordinance, <HI>will eat and drink judgment to his own &s;oul: For what concord hath the temple of God with idols?</HI> This practice of yours, is what the Apo&s;tle calls <HI>idolatry,</HI> and none &s;uch <HI>can have communion with God.</HI> You are <HI>lovers of plea&s;ures,</HI> and adore the god of &s;en&s;uali|ty; have no true &s;atisfaction, <HI>but in rioting and drunkenne&s;s,</HI> and forbidden plea&s;ures; you are idola|ters, and cannot enjoy communion with God in this ordinance.</P>
<P>YOU who are &s;laves to pride and pa&s;&s;ion, allow me to tell you, that you al&s;o are idolaters, and are unfit to approach to God in this communion. What holds any man in &s;ubjection is his ma&s;ter, and when they willingly obey this ma&s;ter, in oppo&s;ition to all things be&s;ide, this is to them an idol. All men, who to gratify their pride and pa&s;&s;ion, and will u&s;e undue means to obtain gratification, to the di&s;honour of God, and the hurt of his church, the&s;e are per&s;ons who are none of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s willing &s;ubjects, but wor&s;hippers of pride, and &s;laves to their own vicious humours. What a &s;trange &s;ight it is to &s;ee that man profe&s;s friend&s;hip to <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and his friends, by &s;itting at the &s;ame communion, when he is a continual dupe to <HI>Satan,</HI> and &s;lave to his pride! Pride is the mo&s;t un&s;eemly thing for com|municants, and mo&s;t provoking to <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> and no man who gives loo&s;e reins to his pride is fit to join in this holy ordinance, which we have ju&s;t now be|fore us. Any per&s;on who is proud of his gifts, whatever they are, and values him&s;elf on account of them, is a <HI>wor&s;hipper of the creature more than the
<PB N="208" REF="216">Creator.</HI> Be exhorted, thou proud, vain, &s;elf-con|ceited per&s;on, to become humble: <HI>What ha&s;t thou, that thou ha&s;t not received?</HI> Thy pride is mo&s;t un|rea&s;onable, for thou art proud of what is not thine own: <HI>Who made thee to differ from another?</HI> It was not thy&s;elf, but God.</P>
<P>CONSIDER it avails thee nothing that thou art nobly or highly de&s;cended, or that all thy pre|dece&s;&s;ors were men of hone&s;t repute; this is but thy di&s;grace, while you act unworthy of your cha|racter, and &s;uch ance&s;tors.

What then, O vain hypocrite, do you boa&s;t of? Of that which is none of thine own virtues, nor thine own free choice. If it were any virtue in you, you would mode&s;tly conceal it, and not be always blabbing it out, and boa&s;ting thereof. When a man begins to boa&s;t of his endowments, they are no longer virtues in him; all the good he hath done, is lo&s;t in the mid&s;t of his pride. Beware of this evil principle of pride; it will hinder your communion with God, and make you <HI>eat and drink judgment to your own &s;ouls.</HI></P>
<P>ALLOW me al&s;o to addre&s;s &s;uch as are thought|le&s;s and incon&s;iderate. Many without con&s;ideration and thought, cu&s;tomarily join in this &s;olemn ordi|nance, when yet they neither have ju&s;tly con&s;ider|ed the needful preparation, nor how they ought to live afterwards. The&s;e will certainly provoke God to bring &s;ome judgment upon them, becau&s;e they make too free with holy things.</P>
<P>THE want of con&s;ideration, is the rea&s;on why &s;ome declare them&s;elves <HI>one bread</HI> with the friends of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in the &s;acrament of the &s;upper, and very &s;oon after fall into all <HI>&s;uperfluity of naughtine&s;s.</HI>

<P>He that being often reproved, harden$th <HI>his</HI> neck, &s;hall &s;uddenly be de&s;troyed, and that without remedy.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_REPROOF is an ordinance of God, and one of the ends of Divine Revela|tion, 2 Tim. iii. 16. <HI>All &s;cripture</HI> is <HI>given by in&s;piration of God, and</HI> is <HI>profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction,</HI> and <HI>for in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> It is de&s;igned as a rod for the con&s;cience, to reclaim the &s;oul from errors and mi&s;takes. It &s;uppo&s;es guilt or error actually exi&s;ting, and that its objects are turned a&s;ide from the paths of virtue. Where there is no guilt, re|proof hath no object; but wherever there is guilt, reproof takes place. Reproof is a kind of &s;piritual di&s;cipline, de&s;igned to reclaim men from their er|rors and mi&s;takes; but where it does not reclaim, it ordinarily hardens the &s;tubborn &s;oul. <HI>Solomon,</HI> from experience, found that reproof did not always an&s;wer the intended end, and &s;o there was need for repeating it; but after it was often repeated with|out &s;ucce&s;s, it had a tendency to harden the heart, that no impre&s;&s;ion could be made upon it by &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive reproofs.</P>
<P>THERE is nothing more provoking to God than incorrigiblene&s;s: Not to li&s;ten to his reproofs, is to defend &s;in again&s;t God, and commence advo|cate for the devil. There is no character among men more hateful than a wilful, ob&s;tinate &s;inner, that &s;ins over the belly of all reproof and admoni|tion. The condition of &s;uch a per&s;on is very hope|le&s;s: For the con&s;cience like an anvil grows harder by reproof, and the con&s;equence is at la&s;t ab&s;olute
<PB N="212" REF="220">de&s;pair. When reproof and admonition do not gain and per&s;uade men, they at la&s;t prove their greate&s;t torment. The &s;inner that &s;tands long out again&s;t reproof, <HI>falls &s;uddenly at la&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>EVERY reproof that is not well received, and taken notice of, and followed with amendment, is the poi&s;on in the con&s;cience, that breaks out in ruptures of de&s;pair in the end.</P>
<P>THOUGH it be not immediately felt, it does not cea&s;e to operate, but works &s;ilently the ruin of the &s;oul: Tho' it does not break out in open ex|clamations again&s;t God, or &s;uch as reprove them; yet it works in the way of &s;ecret grudge, and pri|vate reflections. This ob&s;tinacy is like a di&s;ea&s;e that is long in gathering, that when it comes to a height, it &s;uddenly terminates in death. It may long work &s;lowly, but advances towards its perfec|tion by &s;ure &s;teps.</P>
<P>THE man that does not amend his errors, when reproved and admoni&s;hed, tho' he may not run fa&s;t, yet he walks on &s;urely to hell. The mo&s;t hopele&s;s condition of a man is, when he has been often &s;hewn his duty, and reproved for his &s;in, but ha$ gone on in his own way notwith&s;tanding; our text &s;ays, <HI>he &s;hall be de&s;troyed, and that without reme|dy.</HI> Tho' &s;uch per&s;ons are not without the reach of God's grace; yet we have no in&s;tances in &s;crip|ture that any of them were converted.</P>
<P>IN di&s;cour&s;ing further upon this &s;ubject, I &s;hall fir&s;t enquire, what is here meant by reproof.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, CONSIDER this ob&s;tinacy again&s;t it, which is &s;o fatal.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, OPEN up the nature of this threatening denounced again&s;t this ob&s;tinacy.</P>
<P>THEN improve the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t thing in our method is, to enquire what is meant by <HI>reproof.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. IT contains in it the&s;e arguments that point
<PB N="213" REF="221">forth truth in the cleare&s;t light. He who reproves error, ought fir&s;t to &s;hew the difference between it and truth. This is promi&s;ed of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> I&s;a. xi. 4. <HI>But with righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he &s;hall &s;mite the carth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips &s;hall he &s;tay the wicked.</HI> There is not a more &s;evere reproof can be given to a wicked man than to point forth the truth be|fore his eyes: This brings as it were a gla&s;s be|fore his eyes, wherein he may &s;ee his own moral complexion. The truth is a painful thing to one who is con&s;cious of his own guilt. Suppo&s;e a re|proof is not intended to any individual; yet the &s;imple telling of the truth will give the guilty un|ea&s;ine&s;s, and be a &s;ecret reproof to their con&s;cience, and beget pain. This was the way how <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> re|proved the world of &s;in: He taught the truth in oppo&s;ition to the prevailing vices and errors of the times.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Jews</HI> hated <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> becau&s;e he told them <HI>the truth,</HI> and the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> became an enemy to the <HI>Galatians</HI> for the &s;ame rea&s;on; <HI>Am I become your enemy,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>becau&s;e I tell you the truth?</HI> Gal. iv. 16.&mdash;John iii. 20, 21. <HI>For every one that doeth evil, hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, le&s;t his deeds &s;hould be reproved. But he that doeth truth, cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manife&s;t that they are wrought in God.</HI></P>
<P>IT is a &s;ufficient reproof to &s;ome per&s;ons to &s;hew the difference between truth and error; for this is &s;etting before the con&s;cience a contra&s;t, where it cannot mi&s;s to &s;ee its own deformity. All doctrinal reproof, con&s;i&s;ts in &s;hewing the difference between truth and fal&s;hood wherever they are; &s;o that tho&s;e who are po&s;&s;e&s;t of either, cannot mi&s;s to &s;ee either rea&s;on to approve or condemn them&s;elves. Such reproof as this will &s;erve all its purpo&s;es, to a man
<PB N="214" REF="222">of under&s;tanding, as Prov. xix. 25. <HI>Reprove one that hath under&s;tanding,</HI> and <HI>he will under&s;tand knowledge.</HI> But when the mind is ignorant or contracted, or wrapt up in the plea&s;ure of vice of any kind, this kind of reproof will only have the effect of di&s;plea|&s;ing and hardening the &s;inner.</P>
<P>THE &s;tronge&s;t arguments the go&s;pel can afford will, to &s;ome little minds and worldly &s;ouls, be like the &s;un which only hardens the earth: Their earth|ly minds are more and more hardened by the truth, and make a &s;tronger re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t it; as 2 Kings xvii. 14. <HI>Notwith&s;tanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks, like to the necks of their fathers, that did not believe in the Lord their God.</HI> Jer. xix. 15. <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts the God of I&s;rael, Behold, I will bring upon this city, and upon all her towns, all the evil that I have pronounced again&s;t it: Becau&s;e they have hardened their necks, that they might not hear my words.</HI> Every doctrinal truth which is revealed in the go&s;pel, has no other effect upon them, than &s;uch had upon &s;ome nominal di&s;ciples, who followed <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in the days of his fle&s;h, John vi. 60, 66. Who <HI>&s;aid, This is an hard &s;aying, who can hear it? And from that</HI> time <HI>many of his di&s;ciples went back, and walked no more with him.</HI> It is evi|dent that the arguments of the go&s;pel are de&s;igned for a reproof to &s;inners, for they generally take them as &s;uch, and are offended at them, and harden their necks again&s;t them.</P>
<P>AND if we join common experience with Scrip|ture we will &s;ee this truth clearly evidenced. Ex|perience teacheth us, that &s;ome who have had other views of following <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> than for truth's &s;ake, as &s;oon as any go&s;pel truth is clo&s;ely pre&s;&s;ed, and ur|ged upon them in its true nature and light, it cau&s;eth them to go back, and for&s;ake a cau&s;e they have profe&s;&s;ed much zeal for, and been very well plea&s;ed with, even when they had no pretence of
<PB N="215" REF="223">con&s;cience to alter their conduct. To &s;ay that &s;ome duties ought to be done, and that it is damnable to neglect them, in the pre&s;ence of &s;ome people, is much the &s;ame as to &s;ay, <HI>thou art the man;</HI> at lea&s;t it has the &s;ame effect: Nothing is the rea&s;on of this offence, but that the go&s;pel arguments are re|proofs to their guilty con&s;cience.</P>
<P>DOCTRINAL reproofs are certainly needful, &s;eeing iniquity creeps in among people in&s;en&s;ibly, and cannot be found out otherwi&s;e. This is the fir&s;t way of finding out &s;ome of the enemies of re|ligion, by &s;etting forth the truth as evidently again&s;t their vices as po&s;&s;ible: For as long as truth is ex|pre&s;&s;ed in general terms, tho&s;e who are only hang|ers on, as it were, in the the church, will pa&s;s un|di&s;covered. But when once the pre&s;ent needful truth is clearly opened up, and pre&s;ent duty urged, it di&s;covers the dro&s;s, <HI>and &s;eparates the chaff from the wheat.</HI></P>
<P>THE rea&s;on why that truth is a reproof to wicked men is, becau&s;e it points again&s;t their errors on all occa&s;ions. Hence there never can be a prevailing error or vice, but there is &s;ome truth to detect it; &s;o that one need &s;carcely do any thing el&s;e to re|prove vice, but to publi&s;h its oppo&s;ite truth: This will be a &s;evere enough reproof to all who are guilty.</P>
<P N="2">2. ANOTHER branch of reproof is, the pointing forth of &s;in in its mo&s;t lively colours. The mo&s;t &s;evere reproof that can be given to a guilty per&s;on is, to draw his moral picture, and let him &s;ee it as it is. Every de&s;cription of the nature and con&s;e|quences of &s;in, is a &s;evere reproof to the guilty. It would be a very cutting reproof certainly to a drunkard and a &s;wearer, to draw his own picture when he was in his revels, and let him &s;ee it in his calm moments, and copy that incoherent lan|guage of hell he expre&s;&s;es in his cups, and read it
<PB N="216" REF="224">to him when he was &s;ober: It would either make him fall out with him&s;elf, or give him great of|fence at the author.</P>
<P>To point out the evil of the &s;in of omi&s;&s;ion, and the ba&s;ene&s;s of that character who neglects his duty, will be a reproof to &s;uch as mind not their obligations to their Maker and Redeemer.</P>
<P>FOR example, if one without any particular ap|plication, &s;hould de&s;cribe the neglect of family-wor|&s;hip to be ingratitude to God, and a practical de|nying of his Providence, a &s;in that brings down his wrath upon families, and deprives a man of a ju&s;t title to the name of a chri&s;tian; that it is murdering a ri&s;ing generation, and robbing God of his due, by neglecting to acknowledge every return of his goodne&s;s in that &s;ocial capacity it is received: That &s;uch had no right to the &s;eals of God's Co|venant, Bapti&s;m and the Lord's Supper; there are many who would think they were &s;everely enough reproved, tho' no application was made. Or, if one &s;hould de&s;cribe covetou&s;ne&s;s to be a too anxious concern for, and a too con&s;tant pur&s;uit after things that are not our own, or a &s;eeking to advance our own worldly intere&s;t at the expence of other people's happine&s;s, or the good of the Common Weal: Such as adding <HI>hou&s;e to hou&s;e, and field to field,</HI> I&s;a. v. 8. Or a coveting another man's bu&s;ine&s;s or em|ployment, becau&s;e he pro&s;pers in it: That it al&s;o con&s;i&s;ted in monopolies and fore&s;talling of any kind of provi&s;ions that the poor make u&s;e of; or in <HI>ta|king pledges from the poor,</HI> and keeping them when he cannot want them, without great prejudice to him&s;elf or family. Deut. xxiv. 12. <HI>If the man</HI> be <HI>poor, thou &s;halt not &s;leep with his pledge.</HI> If it &s;hould be urged, that &s;uch as endeavoured to en|crea&s;e his worldly circum&s;tances by engro&s;&s;ing and monopolizing, by joining more bu&s;ine&s;&s;es than were convenient for the good of the poor, would
<PB N="217" REF="225">encrea&s;e the Divine anger again&s;t him: And he who <HI>keeps the poor man's pledge in his hou&s;e,</HI> keeps the cur&s;e of the Almighty along with it; there are &s;undry would think this a hard enough reproof. And if to this it &s;hould be added, that he is a covetous per|&s;on, who withholds from his brother that aid that is nece&s;&s;ary for his &s;upport, when it is in his power; or refu&s;es the calls and demands that God and Re|ligion have upon him to &s;upport their intere&s;t, and applies to his worldly purpo&s;es what God has given him to &s;upport chri&s;tianity: Add to all, &s;hould it be affirmed, that &s;uch a man can no more <HI>enter into the kingdom of God, than a Camel can go through the eye of a needle,</HI> the reproof would be under&s;tood, and reckoned very uncharitable.</P>
<P>EVERY de&s;cription of &s;in is a reproof to the guilty &s;oul, and tho' often &s;inners find means to &s;tave off the conviction, yet they cannot get clear of the wound. The picture of &s;in that is drawn in the word, and the wrath of God that attends it, will by times like a &s;pectre recoil upon them, and give them pain.</P>
<P N="3">3. REPROOF con&s;i&s;ts in a &s;pecial enumeration of the mo&s;t prevalent &s;ins, and condemning &s;inners for committing them. This is called, <HI>a &s;etting &s;in before us.</HI> P&s;al. l. 21. <HI>The&s;e</HI> things <HI>thou ha&s;t done, and I kept &s;ilence: thou thoughte&s;t that I was altoge|ther</HI> &s;uch a one <HI>as thy&s;elf:</HI> but <HI>I will reprove thee, and &s;et</HI> them <HI>in order before thine eyes.</HI></P>
<P>THE fir&s;t two mentioned methods of reproof will prevail with &s;uch as are &s;omething tractable, that are not overcome with long habits and rooted prejudices: But a more plain, open and pointed way is needful, to reach the bottom of benumbed con&s;ciences, in order to reach a home conviction. Often it happens that &s;inners will join in the gene|ral condemnation of &s;in in others, like <HI>David,</HI> but never mind their own, till the reproof be &s;poken
<PB N="218" REF="226">more particularly, <HI>Thou art the man.</HI> The mo&s;t part of men are like thieves, who will join in the general cry again&s;t a delinquent; but when they them&s;elves are detected will think more &s;eriou&s;ly upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>WHEN cu&s;tom and long practice has made &s;in familiar to men, they become to them a part of their con&s;titution: They are like <HI>right eyes and right hands,</HI> that mu&s;t be <HI>plucked out, and cut off.</HI> General reproofs are like cutting at the branches while the root remains: There is need of a more particular dealing. It is needful to reach the reproof to the mo&s;t prevalent evil, and denounce the wrath of God again&s;t tho&s;e &s;ins that are mo&s;t beloved.</P>
<P>WHATEVER are prevailing &s;ins of a nation or people, are to be enumerated and &s;et before them, and they are to be warned of their danger on ac|count of them. Such a method as this did the prophet <HI>Ho&s;ea</HI> ob&s;erve in his reproving <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> Ho&s;ea iv. 1, 2, 3. <HI>The Lord hath a controver&s;y with his people: For by &s;wearing, and lying, and killing, and &s;tealing, and committing adultery, and blood touch|eth blood: Therefore &s;hall the land mourn, and every one that is therein.</HI></P>
<P>A FAITHFUL reprover will not fear to in|cur the di&s;plea&s;ure of any man, when he has a call to reprove: The very nature of ju&s;t and true re|proof, obliges him to deal plainly, that if by any means he may &s;ave men from the evil of their ways. Or, if they will not li&s;ten to his ju&s;t reproof, he may clear his own con&s;cience in dealing faithfully with theirs.</P>
<P>BUT as there is an external reproof which the mini&s;try of the word directs again&s;t all &s;in and vice, in all its circum&s;tances, in all &s;orts and degrees of men; there is al&s;o an inward reproof, which men have from their own con&s;ciences, for their crimes
<PB N="219" REF="227">and guilt. This reproof I call the reproof of con&s;cience.</P>
<P>IT con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;elf-condemnation: It is one's heart ri&s;ing again&s;t him&s;elf, for the commi&s;&s;ion of &s;in, which gives pain to the con&s;cience. The A|po&s;tle, <HI>John</HI> iii. 20. gives this as an evidence of the fal&s;hood of a man's conduct: <HI>If our heart con|demn us, God is greater than our heart, and will much more condemn us.</HI> There are many &s;truggles between men's con&s;ciences and their love of in|tere&s;t, plea&s;ures, and appetites, which none but them&s;elves know. Tho' &s;ome by long abu&s;ing their con&s;cience, overcome its reproofs, &s;o as not to feel them &s;o quick, yet it is out of their power to hinder its touches now and then.</P>
<P>CONSCIENCE, that in&s;eperable part of a man's &s;elf, gives reproofs &s;ome way or other for every known &s;in, which is be&s;t under&s;tood to one's &s;elf. There is a certain confu&s;ion of &s;oul which the guilty &s;ometimes labour under, which is nothing but con&s;cience &s;truggling amid&s;t the multitude of other pa&s;&s;ions and appetites. Some hinder or &s;tifle the reproofs of con&s;cience by fal&s;e rea&s;onings, or by hindering it of information; but as &s;oon as ever it is informed of &s;in in the &s;oul, it expre&s;&s;es its antipathy by the pain it produceth in it. Sometimes it reproves, not by begetting a &s;harp, quick &s;en&s;ation of feeling in the &s;oul, but a re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, whereby a &s;inner feels &s;omething troubles him, and he cannot tell what it is. This makes him peevi&s;h and di&s;content. Sometimes men will attribute the cau&s;e of their unea&s;ine&s;s to &s;ome other cau&s;es, when nothing but con&s;cience is the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>THIS is often the ca&s;e with &s;uch as complain of outward cau&s;es. When a friend or neighbour has &s;poken freely to them, and ruffled their temper, they often lay all the blame upon &s;uch an accident; but if con&s;cience was right, this would give them
<PB N="220" REF="228">no trouble. The unea&s;ine&s;s ari&s;es from a &s;truggle between pride and con&s;cience; the one &s;tirring up their pa&s;&s;ion again&s;t their neighbour, the other re|proaching them for that re&s;olution.</P>
<P>REPROOFS of con&s;cience are to the &s;oul what unknown phy&s;ic is to the body; it begets a kind of &s;ickne&s;s which men cannot &s;oon account for: They find an unea&s;ine&s;s, but cannot tell the cau&s;e, and therefore have &s;undry fal&s;e conjectures about their pain and unea&s;ine&s;s. An in&s;tance of this we have in the ca&s;e of <HI>Ahab,</HI> 1 Kings xxi. 4. <HI>And Ahab came into his hou&s;e, heavy and &s;ore di&s;plea&s;ed, becau&s;e of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had &s;poken unto him: For he had &s;aid, I will not give thee the inhe|ritance of my fathers: and he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.</HI> It is a plain ca&s;e, it was more the reproof of his con&s;cience than <HI>Naboth</HI>'s refu&s;al that gave him un|ea&s;ine&s;s: He could have taken it by violence as <HI>Jezebel</HI> did, had not his con&s;cience reproved him. His &s;ickne&s;s was only a &s;truggle between his con|&s;cience, his pride and avarice, which many &s;ince his time have had.</P>
<P>WHEN men's de&s;ires and appetites are &s;trong for any &s;en&s;ual enjoyment, but a &s;en&s;e of inju&s;tice or wrong prevents them from making free with it, it often happens that a moral di&s;order or &s;ickne&s;s gets in the mind; for nothing is readier to di&s;tre&s;s the mind than de&s;ire, the pre&s;ence of an object, and a forbidding con&s;cience. This puts the &s;oul into a kind of confu&s;ion, that it cannot well account for its di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd thing in the method was to explain the nature of that ob&s;tinacy, which re&s;i&s;teth and is &s;trengthened by reproof.</P>
<P N="1">1. THIS ob&s;tinacy con&s;i&s;ts in ignorance of the truth. Men could not if they admitted the evi|dence of truth be ob&s;tinate again&s;t reproof. We
<PB N="221" REF="229">might as well &s;ay, that a man who certainly knew that his hou&s;e &s;hould be burnt upon &s;uch a night, would &s;leep in it that night, as &s;ay that one who under&s;tood the truths of God's word would re&s;i&s;t them ob&s;tinately.</P>
<P>DIVINE truth informs us, that the one is as dangerous as the other, and more &s;o, as the one but endangers the body, the other the &s;oul and body both. Ignorance is at the root of ob&s;tinacy: None are more pragmatical in their way than men of little under&s;tanding. It is but &s;eldom that you will find a man of under&s;tanding and judgment very head&s;trong.</P>
<P>SOME are ignorant wilfully, becau&s;e they do not attend to the proper means of in&s;truction, and &s;o rebelliou&s;ly re&s;i&s;t reproof offered from the truth: Such were the&s;e mentioned, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> iii. 5. who were <HI>wilfully ignorant of the &s;econd coming of Chri&s;t,</HI> tho' they had abundant evidence.</P>
<P>THERE are none &s;o ignorant but they know &s;omething, and pur&s;ue &s;ome one thing they know; but as to the&s;e truths that are Divine, but few are at pains to know them. It happens therefore that thro' ignorance of the Go&s;pel they re&s;i&s;t its truths, by &s;ub&s;tituting their fal&s;e knowledge in the room of it: For men will always be ready to prefer what they know, to what they are ignorant of, if it any way &s;uit their humour and di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>THESE reproofs that ignorant men receive from the word of God, meet with the greate&s;t op|po&s;ition, becau&s;e they are ignorant of the God that gives them: They read not his word, and think any thing &s;trange they hear from it, that &s;eems con|trary to their ob&s;ervation in temporal things. To tell a man that is accu&s;tomed to ea&s;e and plea&s;ure, <HI>that he mu&s;t deny him&s;elf,</HI> is like taking a dog by the ears: The rea&s;on is, he is acquainted with his plea&s;ures, but not with his Bible. To acquaint a
<PB N="222" REF="230">worldly-minded man of the nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>overcoming the world,</HI> is to <HI>take away his god,</HI> and he knows not where to find another. But were men acquainted with the truths of the go&s;pel, they would find that all its reproofs were &s;alutary, de&s;igned for health to the &s;oul. Ignorance of the de&s;igned of go&s;pel or|dinances makes men ob&s;tinately perver&s;e again&s;t reproof. When men are not acquainted with the true &s;piritual de&s;ign of the mini&s;try of the word, and all the in&s;titutions of the go&s;pel, they will ob|&s;tinately oppo&s;e all the reproofs they meet with, for neglecting them. When <HI>Paul</HI> came into <HI>The&s;|&s;alonia,</HI> the <HI>Jews</HI> there, ignorant of the true de|&s;ign of the go&s;pel, violently per&s;ecuted him and his adherents, and cry'd, <HI>The&s;e who turn the world up|&s;ide down are come here al&s;o.</HI> Had they not been ignorant of the de&s;ign of the go&s;pel, they would not have been &s;o ob&s;tinate.</P>
<P>MANY becau&s;e they are ignorant of that op|po&s;ition that the go&s;pel e&s;tabli&s;hes between chri&s;ti|anity and the world, ob&s;tinately oppo&s;e its reproofs. They imagine that the&s;e cu&s;toms by which they live and have had their wealth, or as &s;ome &s;ay their bread, mu&s;t not be infringed.&mdash;If you urge upon them the practice of any duty, which alters their cu&s;toms, they mo&s;t perver&s;ely oppo&s;e it; and if reproved by any for preferring cu&s;tom to religious duties, they will plainly tell you they do not &s;ee the need of it; or if they partly &s;ee it, they cannot &s;ee why it &s;hould be oppo&s;ed to their cu&s;tom, to make them differ with the world.</P>
<P>MEN who know truly the value of religion, know al&s;o that the very de&s;ign of the go&s;pel is to &s;et them at variance with the world. This is a part of that divi&s;ion <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> came to &s;end upon the earth, and that fire he came to kindle, which will continue to burn till all the earth be burnt up. For this rea&s;on they &s;ubmit to reproof, becau&s;e they
<PB N="223" REF="231">know the need of it, and the worth of religion. Becau&s;e they know the de&s;ign of the go&s;pel, they cheerfully obey its admonitions, and li&s;ten to its reproofs. But &s;uch as are ignorant of that divi&s;ion that mu&s;t be between the world and the lovers of the go&s;pel, will be offended when they are told that they mu&s;t <HI>fall out with father and mother, &s;i&s;ter and brother, and have enemies in their own hou&s;e if they follow Chri&s;t,</HI> Matth. x. 34.</P>
<P>WHY men are &s;o offended at &s;uch truths as are reproofs to them is, becau&s;e they are ignorant of their importance. In the primitive times of chri&s;|tianity, the knowledge of the truths of the go&s;pel made men part with what in after times the igno|rance of the&s;e truths has made mankind fond of, and have cau&s;ed them to be much offended when they have been reproved for acting incon&s;i&s;tent with the primitive rules.</P>
<P>MEN are now ignorant of the&s;e works of cha|rity that the go&s;pel requires of its followers, and for this rea&s;on are offended when they are put in mind of the&s;e duties. There is nothing more plain from Scripture than that it was the practice of the fir&s;t chri&s;tians to &s;ell their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of hou&s;es and lands to relieve their di&s;tre&s;&s;ed brethren, and help tho&s;e in want, as in <HI>Acts</HI> iv. 34. But now one may as well make men believe the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> as believe the Scripture in that particular: The very men|tioning the truth is brought to &s;et the world in arms.</P>
<P>IN the world the &s;tate of towns and cities were then much the &s;ame as they are now; every one had a right to his own inheritance till he &s;old it. But when once they embraced the Go&s;pel, it open|ed their hearts to help their brethren, and made them &s;ell both hou&s;es and lands to relieve the needy. They were obliged to part with what they had, &s;o as not to make them&s;elves de&s;titute, but with what they could &s;pare, and were willing to part with
<PB N="224" REF="232">&s;ome of their inheritance for the &s;ake of the go&s;pel. However hard it may &s;eem to our &s;elfi&s;h views, and love of the world, to &s;ell what we have to a&s;&s;i&s;t <HI>the hou&s;hold of faith;</HI> yet they have a demand upon us according to the Go&s;pel, for we can have no lawful title to what belongs to them. Suppo&s;e the Author of nature never deigned all men to be alike; yet he has ordained by his written law, that &s;uch as are in want have a demand upon tho&s;e who have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions: And in the chri&s;tian &s;ociety, no man hath a ju&s;t right to his own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions while any of the godly within his reach are in want.</P>
<P>I OWN indeed, that according to the laws of na|tions, and human in&s;titutions, the poor have no claim, but what depends upon the plea&s;ure of the great, or the&s;e laws they &s;ee meet to frame:&mdash;Therefore chri&s;tians mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the laws of the country where they re&s;ide, and rather &s;uffer much want than turn rebellious:&mdash;But tho' they as &s;ub|jects, like their great patron, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;uffer thro' the iniquity of human laws, they are like to &s;uffer patiently; but tho' this is the ca&s;e according to the order of difference between them and the world, yet it cannot be &s;o among them&s;elves. The laws of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> are different; tho' they cannot go to tho&s;e who are not of them, to make demands for the &s;upply of their wants, yet they can go to a bro|ther and a&s;k what they need if he hath it.</P>
<P>THE Apo&s;tle <HI>James</HI> &s;hews us the chri&s;tian law in this particular, Chap. ii. 14. <HI>What</HI> doth it <HI>profit, my brethren, though a man &s;ay he hath faith, and have not works? Can faith &s;ave him? If a brother or &s;i&s;ter be naked, and be de&s;titute of daily food; and one of you &s;ay unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled: notwith&s;tanding you give them not tho&s;e things which are needful to the body; what</HI> doth it <HI>profit?</HI></P>
<P>THROUGH ignorance of this chri&s;tian law, men are offended at the&s;e truths that reprove their pride
<PB N="225" REF="233">and covetou&s;ne&s;s. Is it any thing like chri&s;tianity for any man to live luxuriou&s;ly upon the fat of the earth, and be <HI>cloathed in gay cloathing,</HI> and have his children &s;hining in apparel, beyond even an ordi|nary &s;tation, and yet refu&s;e needful charity to poor &s;aints? Would it not be more like the laws of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> to &s;trip a prodigal foppi&s;h child of his &s;uperfluities, and his unnece&s;&s;ary ornaments, and give them to a naked &s;aint? Would it not be better to give that money which he will &s;pend at the tavern, or at the gaming-table, to &s;upply &s;ome hungry chri&s;tian fa|mily?</P>
<P>NOTHING but the ignorance of the go&s;pel can make men &s;o ob&s;tinately oppo&s;e &s;uch truths, and be offended at reproof.</P>
<P N="2">2. ANOTHER cau&s;e of this ob&s;tinacy is unbelief. Men could not with&s;tand the force of Go&s;pel re|proof, unle&s;s they had unbelieving hearts. It is becau&s;e men do not believe the truth of God's word that makes them &s;o very ob&s;tinate. This is clearly evidenced in the ca&s;e of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> in the wilder|ne&s;s: Their unbelief hindered them from taking no|tice of God's reproof and admonitions. God often reproved and corrected them, but they &s;till were ob|&s;tinate, and provoked him with their rebellion.</P>
<P>HAD they been per&s;uaded that what <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> told them from the mouth of the Lord was true, they could not have &s;o often rebelled again&s;t him: But the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> gives the cau&s;e, P&s;al. lxxviii. 22. <HI>They believed not in God, nor tru&s;ted in his &s;alvation.</HI> They had a &s;ecret di&s;tru&s;t in their minds of the word of God, and &s;o thought things would not turn out as they did. If men believed that the Almighty &s;poke truth, they would not dare to re&s;i&s;t his reproofs, but turn to duty and from &s;in at every one of them. They do not believe the nece&s;&s;ity of duty, and &s;o are offended when it is urged; they do not firmly believe that &s;in will have &s;uch ill con&s;equences, and
<PB N="226" REF="234">&s;o do not fear to commit it, and are offended when they are reproved for it: They do not fully believe that wi&s;dom or religion is the principal thing, and &s;o are offended when it is oppo&s;ed to their other intere&s;ts. The rea&s;on of this ob&s;tinacy is nothing more than that they never believe that religion has the fir&s;t demands upon them, and that if any com|petition come between the world and it, religion mu&s;t be preferred. They believe the very contrary, as their practice and lives amply declare: If reli|gion was fir&s;t in their hearts, it would be fir&s;t in their practice al&s;o: But it is la&s;t in their practice, and &s;o la&s;t in their hearts. It is a ju&s;t &s;aying of <HI>So|lomon, As a man thinketh, &s;o is he,</HI> i. e. if he have true notions of religion, and be per&s;uaded of its truths, his life and practice declare it: But if he think otherwi&s;e, that other things be&s;ide religion are as important, or that he may mingle their in|tere&s;ts, then he will act accordingly in life.</P>
<P>UNBELIEF in heart is the cau&s;e of all ob&s;tinacy again&s;t the reproofs of the go&s;pel, nor is there any rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e the lea&s;t con&s;i&s;tency between ob|&s;tinacy and true faith. A man that will harden his neck again&s;t reproof, when it is evident he is a ju&s;t object of it, is ju&s;t as evidently an unbeliever. The cau&s;e and the effect are alike. Unbelief in its own nature, is rebellion again&s;t God; and ob&s;tinacy a|gain&s;t go&s;pel reproofs is the genuine fruit of un|belief.</P>
<P>THE &s;oul would be quite tractable if there was no unbelief, and would li&s;ten to every law of its Maker with the greate&s;t delight; but when once di&s;tru&s;t, or &s;elf-dependence &s;upplies the place of faith and dependence upon the word of God, thence ari&s;e rebellion and ob&s;tinacy. Since the fall of <HI>Adam</HI> there has been an untractablene&s;s in the na|ture of man, and a bias to &s;elf-&s;eeking and depen|dence; and until faith in the &s;aving truth of the
<PB N="227" REF="235">Divine record, takes place in the room of that un|belief, men will always be offended at the reproofs of the go&s;pel. Unbelief is oppo&s;ite unto the very nature and end of the go&s;pel, and &s;o endeavours to make that end void, by re&s;i&s;ting reproof. And un|believer is not known &s;o well any other way as by what effect reproof has upon him. He may con|ceal his unbelief from the world, &s;o long as he meets with no re&s;i&s;tance, but when once his pride is piqued by reproof, he appears in his own colours an unbeliever. The&s;e unbelievers who came out of <HI>Egypt</HI> with <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> &s;eemed tractable till once they met with reproof and contradiction. In the xv. Chap. of <HI>Numbers</HI> we find a man <HI>gathering &s;ticks upon the Sabbath,</HI> who by the commandment of God <HI>was &s;toned with &s;tones to death.</HI> Becau&s;e <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> o|beyed the word of the Lord in curbing and repro|ving &s;in, in the beginning of Chap. xvi. we find a great po&s;&s;e gathered again&s;t him.</P>
<P>THEY bluntly tell <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron, that they took too much upon them, &s;eeing all the Lord's people were holy,</HI> Chap. xvi. 3. Which was as much as if they had &s;aid, we do not believe your authority, and that the miracles thou ha&s;t wrought are from God: (For <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> did nothing but by the Divine orders.) You have &s;toned a man for gathering a few &s;ticks, which is, we think, an effect of your pride and tyranny, and not a command from the God of our fathers. In this you &s;hew great di&s;re|&s;pect to the princes of the congregation.</P>
<P>WHILE the&s;e unbelievers met with no reproofs to their pride and vanity, they pa&s;&s;ed for the Lord's people, and thought them&s;elves &s;uch as in Chap. xvi. 3. But God made a very &s;pecial di&s;covery of them, fir&s;t by reproving their pride, and then by &s;ending them down alive to the &s;ides of the pit. Reproof finds out &s;tiff-necked unbelievers, and unbelievers di&s;cover them&s;elves by their ob&s;tinacy
<PB N="228" REF="236">again&s;t reproof. The fal&s;e-hearted rotten mem|bers of the church, are found out by reproof. There is no other way of finding out the&s;e unbe|lieving hypocrites, who&s;e he arts are overgrown with pride and worldly-mindedne&s;s, but by this pointed weapon of the Holy Spirit. It pierces them to the heart, and tho' it does not ordinarily prove the means of their &s;alvation, yet it makes them di&s;co|ver them&s;elves by the re&s;i&s;tance they make.</P>
<P>IT may not indeed make them fall out in con|ceit with their own way, no more than it did <HI>Korah</HI> and his company; but they may &s;tand out ob&s;ti|nately as they did, till the la&s;t, and never read their error till they do it in eternal torments.&mdash;Some|times the countenance of multitudes, and the re|&s;pect that is paid them by &s;ome in good repute, may &s;trengthen them in oppo&s;ition; becau&s;e they have been &s;ometimes famous in a congregation; and like <HI>Korah</HI> and <HI>Dathan,</HI> leaders in it, they reckon them&s;elves men of importance, and cannot endure reproof, and therefore re&s;i&s;t it to the la&s;t.</P>
<P>NEITHER will unbelievers readily fear reproof or threatening; they di&s;cover them&s;elves unbelievers by their ob&s;tinacy, not by their fear. Tho' they were told that <HI>the earth would &s;wallow them up</HI> in the 30th ver&s;e, yet we find no evidences of fear or &s;u&s;picion among them. So &s;trong was their unbe|lief, that they never &s;u&s;pected that any &s;uch con&s;e|quence would happen. And perhaps I am open|ing the cau&s;e of this ob&s;tinacy to &s;ome ju&s;t now, who will re&s;i&s;t all reproofs given them from the word, and never &s;u&s;pect them&s;elves of an error, <HI>till hell be moved for them at their coming.</HI></P>
<P>I WISH Divine Grace may prevent any &s;uch dreadful con&s;equences; but am afraid that many of the profe&s;&s;ors of religion among us are got be|yond the power of ordinary reproof thro' unbelief. There is &s;o much &s;ecurity among men, that it
<PB N="229" REF="237">&s;peaks out the greate&s;t degree of heart-unbelief. They are no more concerned about what the go&s;pel &s;ays to them, in the way of reproof, than <HI>Korah</HI> was when &s;tanding in his tent door.</P>
<P N="3">3. AN OTHER cau&s;e of ob&s;tinacy is fal&s;e hope. However far men be in an error, they are ready to hope well of them&s;elves: Like tho&s;e mentioned by the prophet, who &s;aid, <HI>All &s;hould be well, though they walked after the imaginations of their own heart.</HI> Such as are members of the church, often found their hope upon their privileges; becau&s;e they are admitted into the communion of the church, and allowed to partake of her ordinances, they hope well of them&s;elves: <HI>We are Abraham's children,</HI> &s;aid a pre&s;umptuous people.</P>
<P>THOUGH they re&s;i&s;t the admonitions and re|proofs of the go&s;pel, yet they hope well of them|&s;elves, becau&s;e they only did it under &s;uch and &s;uch circum&s;tances. If they be reproved for neglecting their duty, they alledge they could not help it, be|cau&s;e they were urged with pre&s;&s;ing calls to the contrary, and &s;o hope they may be chri&s;tians becau&s;e they did not neglect it, when they had nothing el&s;e to do: Not minding the words of <HI>Chri&s;t, Let the dead bury their dead, but follow thou me.</HI></P>
<P>THIS fal&s;e hope, or I might rather call it pre|&s;umption, makes men hope for &s;alvation, even altho' they di&s;unite every thing God hath joined together. We have no warrant from &s;cripture to hope for &s;alva|tion when we wilfully neglect any known duty; yet many who almo&s;t neglect every ordinance and duty, publi&s;hed in the go&s;pel, will put in their pretences for hopes of &s;alvation. Even our hone&s;t fa&s;hionable mockers of God, who are ma&s;ters in a great mea|&s;ure of their own time, and have the power of their families, will put in their claim for hope of &s;alva|tion, tho' they never <HI>bow their knee to him,</HI> but when they are able to do nothing el&s;e: When they can|not
<PB N="230" REF="238">not longer, for wearine&s;s, &s;erve <HI>Mammon,</HI> they pre|&s;ent a dead &s;tatue to the Almighty. But alas! the <HI>morning &s;acrifice</HI> is wanting, which is an eminent part of the chri&s;tian's Duty. <HI>David</HI> did not neg|lect morning wor&s;hip to God, but mo&s;t diligently performed it: P&s;al. cxli. 2. <HI>Let my prayer come up before thee as incen&s;e;</HI> and <HI>the lifting up of my hands, as the evening &s;acrifice.</HI></P>
<P>THE third thing in the method was, <HI>to point out the danger of hardening our necks again&s;t reproof.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. FROM in&s;tances recorded in &s;cripture. (1.) The <HI>old world</HI> before the flood, hardened their necks again&s;t the&s;e admonitions and reproofs they received from <HI>Noah, a preacher of righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Tho' he reproved them both by his doctrine and holy life, yet they took no notice of his pure and well-intended admonitions. They went on in fol|ly, and ran fa&s;t in the paths of wickedne&s;s; no warning or reproof had any effect upon them. But behold on a &s;udden <HI>the windows of heaven were opened; Noah</HI> entered into the ark, the &s;ubterranean waters gu&s;hed up from the bowels of the earth, the &s;ea overwhelmed the adjacent lands. Now the &s;tiff-necked world, who laughed at the reproof of righteous <HI>Noah,</HI> are forced to run from height to height, till they reach the highe&s;t &s;ummit of the neare&s;t mountains, while their enemy, the waters, are clo&s;e pur&s;uing them on all hands. Ah! the &s;ons of riot and drunkenne&s;s, who would not li&s;ten to reproof given them in &s;ea&s;on, how pale do they &s;tand upon the pike of every high hill? Methinks I &s;ee &s;ome rich glutton, ju&s;t new awaked from the drow&s;y &s;lumbers a nocturnal debauch had thrown him into, ju&s;t opening his gory eyes, and beholding the waters fa&s;t approaching his &s;tately palace, the labour of many years, and the expence of va&s;t &s;ums of gold and &s;ilver. How does he &s;tart, rave, and cur&s;e his fate: Ah! my hou&s;e, my gold, my &s;ilver,
<PB N="231" REF="239">my delicate wife, my tender children, mu&s;t they all peri&s;h in the water: But, ah my&s;elf! whither &s;hall I flee. All things are now no more to me!&mdash;Away he runs, a&s;cends the neare&s;t height, and &s;tands trembling, waiting for his approaching foe! Beholds the waters a&s;cend his height, and at la&s;t &s;wallow him up in their billows!</P>
<P>OH! I think I hear him communing with him|&s;elf thus: <Q>What fool was I to reject the warnings &startq;and reproofs that holy <HI>Noah</HI> gave me? He told me of this awful flood; but I was &s;o much en|gaged in worldly pur&s;uits and plea&s;ures, &s;o much drown'd in &s;en&s;uality, that I did not be|lieve him, and now I mu&s;t be drown'd in this deluge of water. But ah! my heart trembles at the thought! My guilty con&s;cience! ah, my con&s;cience tells me I mu&s;t fall into <HI>the hands of the living God.</HI> Oh! could this flood but drown my guilt, or &s;wallow me up in the womb of non|exi&s;tence: This my con&s;cience tells me is de|nied &endq;me!</Q> But ah, de&s;pair &s;eizes him, and he &s;inks in the deep!</P>
<P>IN yonder new-built palace &s;tands a gay youth upon the thre&s;hold of his own door, looking this and the other way, where to run for &s;afety, and a little re&s;pite. Perhaps he was one of tho&s;e who laughed at <HI>Noah</HI>'s preaching, and hardened his neck again&s;t his loving reproofs and admonitions. Mo&s;t likely in the pride of his heart he boa&s;ted <HI>that he had goods laid up for many years,</HI> and valued him|&s;elf upon his dre&s;s, his wealth, and outward accom|pli&s;hments. Behold he runs! forgetful of his glo|rious palace and gorgeous raiment, to &s;hun the de|vouring waters. Had he li&s;tened to reproof and admonition, he had been in the ark with <HI>Noah;</HI> but he hardened his neck again&s;t reproof, and now he is <HI>&s;uddenly de&s;troyed, and that without remedy.</HI></P>
<P>ON a ri&s;ing declivity &s;tands a &s;tupendious e|difice,
<PB N="232" REF="240">encircled with a grove of &s;tately cedars: In <HI>Shinar</HI> was its &s;ituation: Stately rows of oaks, as a &s;econd guard, grew without the verge of the tall cedars. This ca&s;tle belonged to a mighty lord, who for many years had exhau&s;ted va&s;t &s;ums upon it. He was an oppre&s;&s;or of mankind, and an enemy to all true religion. He looks from the parapat of his &s;tately doom, and &s;ees the waters o|verflow the tops of the talle&s;t oaks, and making fa&s;t approaches to the top of his ca&s;tle. The work of many years, nor the expence of va&s;t &s;ums, can|not &s;ave him. His wife and children, hou&s;e and &s;ervants peri&s;h in the flood. He was too high to li&s;ten to reproof, but cannot get above the flood. <HI>He is &s;uddenly de&s;troyed, and that without remedy.</HI></P>
<P>IN the door of a little cottage &s;tands a man of low &s;tature, but of le&s;s virtue, and a le&s;s heart: He was one of tho&s;e whom you may call a worm of the earth. His hou&s;e was the purcha&s;e of his own indu&s;try, the fruit of much care and labour. He robbed his Maker of his ju&s;t due, and him&s;elf of peace to purcha&s;e it. He was always anxious a|bout to-morrow, and deprived him&s;elf of re&s;t and &s;leep by indulging fears that had no real founda|tion. He always made religion &s;ub&s;ervient to <HI>Mammon,</HI> and his joys were founded, not upon re|ligion, but ready money. He was ju&s;t about &s;et|ting off his elde&s;t &s;on in the way of bu&s;ine&s;s when the flood came on. But, behold the clouds began to gather, the heavens put on a &s;able blackne&s;s: <HI>The windows of heaven were opened,</HI> the &s;kies poured out &s;pouts of water: The earth opened, and &s;pewed forth &s;ubterraneous liquid. He would run, but where can he go: Willingly would he enter the ark, <HI>but Noah had &s;hut him&s;elf in.</HI></P>
<P>UNWILLING to part with the fruit of his la|bour and indu&s;try, and waiting for the heavens clearing up, and the clouds di&s;pelling, he keeps
<PB N="233" REF="241">clo&s;e by his cottage till the waters &s;urrounded it, and is &s;uddenly de&s;troyed. He was warned and admoni&s;hed to change his thoughts and enter into the ark, <HI>but now &s;afety is hid from his eyes.</HI> Ah! how he wrings his hands, and wrys his counte|nance, &s;o that every mu&s;cle of his face is di&s;torted: Scarce has he the appearance of human vi&s;age. Oh <HI>Noah,</HI> bring here thy &s;hip and &s;ave me! ex|claims he; I will li&s;ten to thy advices and reproofs now: <HI>But he is &s;uddenly de&s;troyed, and that without remedy.</HI></P>
<P>BEYOND a counter &s;tands <HI>Traffic,</HI> in a &s;hop of his own purcha&s;ing, filled with all the rich embroideries of <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> magnificence; on every hand of him fine linen with tape&s;try. There he &s;tands from morning to night gathering in the ready ca&s;h. He was reproved and admoni&s;hed for &s;pending his time in &s;eeking after gain; but was afraid, and would not li&s;ten to reproof. In the very mean time when a crowd of cu&s;tomers had ju&s;t come into his &s;hop, and his heart was full of the expec|tation of a profitable bargain: Behold, the &s;un withdraws his &s;hining, the heavens put on dark|ne&s;s: Peals of thunder roar and rent the heaven, and water in columns pour forth upon the earth.</P>
<P>BEING &s;ituate in a level champaign country, the &s;uddenne&s;s of the flood detains him and his cu&s;|tomers, waiting for the clearing of the &s;ky.

<P>UP yonder rocky cliff a&s;cends a youth, who climbs from one &s;teep to another to avoid the water pur&s;uing him. He was a &s;on much indulged by a tender parent, who&s;e goodne&s;s he abu&s;ed to &s;erve the ends of prodigality. Many reproofs had he got, but never grew better: His heart was vain and his head empty, he never thought till de&s;truc|tion came. He a&s;cends near the &s;ummit of the rock, but lo&s;ing his &s;tep he tumbles headlong into the deep. His vanity cannot &s;ave him: He was too light for this earth, but is heavy enough to &s;ink in the deep. How does he exclaim, while he hangs by a clift of the rock: Ah! wretch that I am, who would not li&s;ten to advice, but went head|long in the ways of folly, and mu&s;t now fall head|long into the watery aby&s;s. Thus he is <HI>&s;uddenly de|&s;troyed, and that without remedy.</HI></P>
<P>AS it was in the days of <HI>Noah,</HI> &s;o &s;hall it be in the day of the Son of man, the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;a|tion, and at the day of judgment. Our Saviour tells us, <HI>that two &s;hall be grinding in the mill, the one &s;hall be taken and the other left.</HI> All &s;uch as reject go&s;pel reproofs and admonitions, &s;hall meet with the &s;ame fate in the end that the old world met with.</P>
<P N="2">2. ANOTHER in&s;tance we have in the ca&s;e of <HI>Sodom,</HI> and the cities of the plain, who would not li&s;ten to the reproofs of <HI>Lot:</HI> Even his own &s;ons-in-law looked upon all that he &s;aid as mockery, Gen. xix. 14. <HI>He &s;eemed unto them as one that mock|ed.</HI> Their &s;in vexed his holy &s;oul, and he was grieved becau&s;e they would not take advice. But their ob&s;tinacy brought upon them &s;udden de&s;truc|tion. They laughed at <HI>Lot,</HI> but their laughter was turned unto &s;adne&s;s. That fatal morning when <HI>Lot</HI> went out of <HI>Sodom,</HI> the &s;un ro&s;e clear, and the
<PB N="235" REF="243">inhabitants never dreamed of that terrible de&s;truc|tion that came before night. They went on in their voluptuous cour&s;es, and were ob&s;tinate again&s;t both men and angels: But ah, a &s;udden change! <HI>Fire and brim&s;tone rain from heaven,</HI> and all the in|habitants are &s;wallowed up 'ere night. The inha|bitants were an ob&s;tinate people, proud and op|pre&s;&s;ive. Ezek. xvi. 49. <HI>This was the iniquity of thy &s;i&s;ter Sodom; pride, and fullne&s;s of bread, and abundance of idlene&s;s was in her and her daughters; neither did &s;he &s;trengthen the hand of the poor and needy.</HI>&mdash;Becau&s;e they enjoyed plenty and idlene&s;s, they were ob&s;ti|nate; what &s;hould have made them grateful, made them wicked and oppre&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>EXPERIENCE and ob&s;ervation teach us, that men when they enjoy affluence become proud, and the native daughters of pride are ob&s;tinancy and op|pre&s;&s;ion. May we not &s;ee verified in common life, that &s;ome who have been teachable and tractable when poor, when once they have come into a condition of more independence, became more ob&s;tinate and untractable. <HI>Sodom</HI> became rich, and they became wicked and ob&s;tinate; till &s;udden de&s;truction came upon them. Men are very unwilling to believe that the <HI>evil day will come;</HI> and tho&s;e who warn and reprove them, are to them like mockers. The men of <HI>Sodom</HI> never thought that <HI>Lot</HI>'s words would be true, that <HI>God would de&s;troy that wicked city,</HI> and became &s;o hardened in &s;in that they feared no judgments.</P>
<P>WHAT a dreadful alarm would it be to the in|habitants of <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah</HI> when every hou&s;e was full of fire and brim&s;tone? Behold the gay citizen, the voluptuous youth, pa&s;&s;ing their time in plea&s;ure and impurity! Perhaps &s;ome in &s;tews, others in taverns, &s;ome at the gaming table, when &s;uddenly they are all choaked <HI>with fire and brim&s;tone. Lot</HI> told them that <HI>God would de&s;troy that wicked
<PB N="236" REF="244">place;</HI> but they ob&s;tinately re&s;i&s;ted his admonition, and laughed at his reproof: So they are &s;uddenly con&s;umed.</P>
<P>HOW &s;udden was their overthrow? How un|expected their de&s;truction? They were very un|prepared for &s;uch a &s;udden blow. To be in the mid&s;t of fire and brim&s;tone before they had fini&s;hed their wicked devices: How dreadful the thought? All means of e&s;cape were then taken away. Whi|ther, Oh whither, can they fly? The &s;trong and weak are upon a level, no &s;trength can &s;ave the &s;trong man; no fortitude bear thro' the re&s;olute. They were re&s;o|lute in &s;inning, and ob&s;tinate again&s;t all admonition, but cannot with&s;tand the immediate hand of <HI>Jehovah.</HI></P>
<P>METHINKS I hear tho&s;e who would not hear the admonitions of holy <HI>Lot,</HI> raving amid&s;t the fire and brim&s;tone, and exclaiming, Whither, Oh whither, &s;hall we fly? What fools were we not to follow him and &s;ave our lives: Yea &s;ome cur&s;ing heaven in the bitterne&s;s of their torments, till the &s;ulphur &s;top their breath. How wan and pale does the bloom|ing youth look, that in the mid&s;t of rioting and debauchery, ta&s;tes of hell as it were in the body? When the &s;un aro&s;e, the morning clear, the heavens &s;erene, the inhabitants of the plain pur&s;ue their filthy riots. Perhaps &s;ome rich oppre&s;&s;or goes forth to view his ill-gotten po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and fea&s;ts his eyes upon his plea&s;ant fields; when &s;uddenly from a &s;able cloud, a fla&s;h of lightning darts forth, at|tended with a dreadful clap of thunder: A &s;hower of fire and brim&s;tone follows. He runs, he runs to his &s;tately palace! When lo, on a &s;udden, all the city is on fire, and nothing but blackne&s;s mixt with running fire. How awful the thought! The hou&s;e is no &s;helter, but is fewel to the fire. Ah! his hou&s;e, his &s;tately hou&s;e, adorned with all the riches
<PB N="237" REF="245">of the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> and hung with tape&s;try and purple, is all in a flame about him.</P>
<P>THIS the effect of ob&s;tinacy and perver&s;ene&s;s, this the proper fruit and effects of rebellion again&s;t God, and hardening the neck again&s;t reproof. Let <HI>Sodom</HI> and the old world be warnings to us, le&s;t we be <HI>&s;uddenly de&s;troyed, and that without remedy.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. ANOTHER in&s;tance we have of king <HI>Pha|raoh</HI> and the people of <HI>Egypt,</HI> who hardened their necks again&s;t all admonitions and reproof till they were &s;uddenly de&s;troyed. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> time after time warned <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and his people, and re|proved him for not letting <HI>I&s;rael</HI> go <HI>to &s;erve God,</HI> yet he hardened his neck again&s;t all reproof. But at la&s;t he met with a &s;udden overthrow.</P>
<P>THIS haughty monarch could &s;ay, <HI>Who is the Lord that I &s;hould obey him?</HI> And pre&s;umptuou&s;ly pur&s;ued the peculiar people of the Mo&s;t High into the Red Sea; but &s;uddenly the &s;welling billows &s;ur|rounded him and all his ho&s;t. He was warned what the con&s;equence of ob&s;tinacy would be, but gave a deaf ear to all admonitions, till &s;udden de|&s;truction overtook him and all his ho&s;t.</P>
<P>WHAT a &s;ad change of fortune on a &s;udden do we &s;ee? <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and his ho&s;t pur&s;ued <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> they went into the channel of the deep in hopes of bringing back their captives in triumph: But be|hold the waters, at the commandment of <HI>Jehovah,</HI> &s;wallowing up chariots and hor&s;emen! <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s &s;tately chariot and hor&s;es, the glory of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and all his princes overthrown in the depths of the &s;ea.</P>
<P>METHINKS I hear <HI>Pharaoh</HI> calling out to his chariot-driver, Drive, drive as you would &s;ave your own life and the glory of <HI>Egypt,</HI> when &s;uddenly a &s;welling billow carries off the charioteer. <HI>Pharaoh</HI> him&s;elf is obliged to take the reins, and drive the hor&s;es to &s;hun death: What will not even kings do
<PB N="238" REF="246">for life? But ah! the &s;ea over&s;ets chariots, hor&s;es, king, and all! There the ob&s;tinate <HI>Pharaoh</HI> lies drowned in the deep, and is <HI>&s;uddenly de&s;troyed, and that without remedy.</HI> The admonitions of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> had no effect upon his haughty mind; but what rea&s;on could not overcome, the floods did.</P>
<P N="4">4. I SHALL only add another in&s;tance of &s;ud|den de&s;truction, as the fruit of ob&s;tinacy, and hardening the neck again&s;t reproof. The <HI>Jews,</HI> that ancient people, were an ob&s;tinate people. They would not li&s;ten to the voice of God by the pro|phets, but per&s;i&s;ted in their ob&s;tinacy, till they were <HI>&s;uddenly de&s;troyed, and that without remedy.</HI> Even the admonitions of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> could not prevail with them, but they hardened their necks like their fathers. At la&s;t the <HI>Roman</HI> army &s;urrounded the city, de&s;troyed it, and burnt their temple.</P>
<P>THESE Rev. prie&s;ts, and bigoted phari&s;ees; the&s;e &s;uper&s;titious <HI>Jews,</HI> that would not accept of a Saviour, <HI>but crucified the Lord of glory,</HI> &s;uddenly &s;aw their temple and city levelled with the ground. They would not li&s;ten to the voice of truth, but through ob&s;tinacy rejected the go&s;pel; but whither now &s;hall they flee for &s;afety? If they remain in <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> the famine will de&s;troy them; if they flee out of it, the &s;word of the <HI>Romans</HI> will &s;lay them. <HI>They would not mind the things which belonged to their peace, but now they are hid from their eyes.</HI> They were called to the Mo&s;t High, yet none at all would exalt him. <HI>How often would</HI> JEHOVAH <HI>have gather|ed them, as a hen doth her chickens under her wings? and they would not.</HI> But now they &s;ee and feel the effects of their ob&s;tinacy; now they become car|ca&s;es for the <HI>Roman</HI> Eagles to prey upon.</P>
<P>THOSE who tru&s;ted in the temple, and lived by the altar, who rejected all reproofs, and would take no warning, can the temple or altar &s;ave them? No, no! Between the horns of the altar &s;tands <HI>Levi,</HI>
<PB N="239" REF="247">whither he had fled for &s;afety; fa&s;t, fa&s;t does he hold that &s;acred &s;ymbol: But now no more a &s;ymbol, &s;ince the &s;ignification and &s;ub&s;tance came. Blind pre|judice and ob&s;tinacy makes <HI>Levi</HI> &s;till keep the al|tar, and holds by the horns. While this reverend <HI>Jew,</HI> this &s;uper&s;titious prie&s;t, hangs by the horns of this impotent defence, a <HI>Roman</HI> &s;oldier throws a fire brand into the holy place, the <HI>&s;anctum &s;ancto|rum;</HI> and all of a &s;udden the temple is in flames!

<P>WHAT horrid grins, what gha&s;tly looks might be &s;een in every face? The&s;e <HI>Jews</HI> who cried, <HI>Cru|cify him!

Ah ob&s;tinacy! Ob&s;tinacy was the cau&s;e of this awful exit. They would not li&s;ten to reproof, nor hear admonition, and now they are <HI>&s;uddenly de&s;troyed, and that without remedy.</HI></P>
<P>THE la&s;t thing propo&s;ed, was the improvement and application of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE goodne&s;s of God in giving man warn|ing of their danger, and not cutting them off in a moment, in the fir&s;t act of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and wicked|ne&s;s. He reproves men for their good again and again; he gives them <HI>line upon line, precept upon pre|cept,</HI> warning after warning. God might clear his own character in taking &s;inners at their fir&s;t refu&s;al, but he is long-&s;uffering and full of compa&s;&s;ion. The gracious parent of men, the merciful Lord of the world, &s;hews his goodne&s;s, by the pains he is
<PB N="240" REF="248">at to reclaim offenders. He could ea&s;ily rid him|&s;elf of wicked rebels in the twinkling of an eye: He could give a commandment to an angel who could &s;oon de&s;troy multitudes; but in&s;tead of this, he waits graciou&s;ly and patiently, to &s;ee if we will reform. Whether it be to clear his ju&s;tice, or to &s;hew his mercy, it is &s;till mercy to men, as it gives them time and place for repentance, <HI>that their ini|quities prove not their ruin.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. WE may &s;ee great rea&s;on of thankfulne&s;s to God who is &s;o merciful to ob&s;tinate men. He is under no obligation, but freely &s;pares the guilty. No man can &s;ay that God is under obligation to him to keep off the &s;entence of condemnation. How thankful &s;hould men be to God that he has not &s;hut them up in eternal torments for the fir&s;t &s;in they committed? <HI>The angels that left their fir&s;t e&s;tate</HI> did not meet with &s;uch re&s;pite, nor ever got an offer of mercy: Sinners! guilty &s;inners, were the objects of his love, and of his patience and forbearance.</P>
<P>HOW thankful ought go&s;pel-hearers to be, who are both &s;pared, and have the offers of &s;alvation? Are we better than the old world, or <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gommorah,</HI> that he &s;hould &s;pare us, and offer his Son unto us? Nay, all the difference lies in the will of God, which makes the difference: None at all in us, we are not better than they.</P>
<P N="3">3. WE may &s;ee the evil nature of ob&s;tinacy, and hardening our neck again&s;t reproof. It makes men incapable of &s;ober impre&s;&s;ions; it cau&s;eth them to abu&s;e the be&s;t of things: The ble&s;&s;ings of the go&s;pel, which are the be&s;t things we enjoy, it marrs the u&s;efulne&s;s of them to us. Reproofs, ad|monitions, and loving exhortations offend, but do not reclaim ob&s;tinate per&s;ons.</P>
<P>WHEN this ob&s;tinacy takes root, it re&s;i&s;ts the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing calls, and the mo&s;t loving exhorta|tions.
<PB N="241" REF="249">This <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> witne&s;&s;eth in the ca&s;e of <HI>Jeru|&s;alem.

<P>UPON the whole, be all exhorted to guard a|gain&s;t ob&s;tinacy: Harden not your necks again&s;t reproof, nor be offended at tho&s;e who in love warn you of your danger; account them your be&s;t friends who put you in mind of your duty. Be afraid of re&s;i&s;ting reproof; it has a tendency to harden the con&s;cience, and in proce&s;s of time will make you in&s;en&s;ible to either mercies or judgments. Beware of once re&s;i&s;ting any truth, for it will tend to more ob&s;tinacy. <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> when once they began to re&s;i&s;t the warnings God gave them by the pro|phets, went on till they were <HI>&s;uddenly de&s;troyed, and that without remedy.</HI></P>
<P>OBSTINACY is all the &s;hield &s;inners have to

Their puni&s;hment is at la&s;t <HI>greater than they are able to bear;</HI> and they either de&s;pair of mercy, or turn &s;tupid.</P>
<P>IN the ca&s;e of old per&s;ons, who have led a life of &s;in and wickedne&s;s in their youth, it often hap|pens that they &s;ink in de&s;pondency, or end in &s;tu|pidity. Pre&s;umption or de&s;pair is the con&s;e|quence of ob&s;tinacy: They either never dread hell till they be in it, or &s;eem to be in it before the time. Make it your &s;tudy to &s;eek <HI>a broken and a contrite heart, that may tremble at God's word:</HI> Be afraid when you find the word has no effect upon you, that your <HI>con&s;cience becomes not &s;eared as with a hot iron.</HI> The <HI>new heart</HI> is a tender heart, and when reproofs or admonitions are given it &s;u&s;pects it&s;elf.</P>
<P>NONE are more ready to pre&s;ume upon the mercy of God, than &s;uch as are under the power and dominion of &s;in. But, ah! what a fearful wakening, never to dream of danger till in the mid&s;t of it; never to think of hell and de&s;truction, and the wrath of God, till in the mid&s;t of eternal tor|ments. Con&s;ider eternity, O ob&s;tinate &s;inner! you will have an eternity to live in ob&s;tinacy again&s;t God, when his wrath will for ever be poured out upon you, and torment your ob&s;tinate &s;oul.</P>

<P>THERE is nothing which comes under our con&s;ideration &s;o abominable as &s;in, and no &s;in more hateful in the &s;ight of God than hypocri&s;y. The Spirit of God paints forth this &s;in in the mo&s;t ugly colours, and with the highe&s;t aggravations. It is a crime that never is alone in the &s;oul, but is attended with every other vice.

This they did un|der a pretence of regard to religion, though it was only to &s;erve the ends of their policy. The Pro|phets who were &s;ent by God to reprove their vices, and to bring them back to that original &s;y&s;tem God gave them by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> they murdered and &s;lew, becau&s;e they &s;pake again&s;t that policy which they had e&s;tabli&s;hed in oppo&s;ition to <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s in&s;titution. Nothwith&s;tanding this their departure from the de&s;ign of their theocracy, they were far from gi|ving up the ceremonies of their religion, but cried, <HI>The temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord are the&s;e:</HI> Though they had departed from the whole moral part of their religion, as to truth, mercy, judgment, and faith, they yet were zealous for that outward part which introduced them into wealth and preferment. It was found nece&s;&s;ary, as it is in all countries where there is any policy, or civility, not to take away the minds of the populace from religion altogether; but at the &s;ame time to &s;uit it to their inclinations, that thereby it might an&s;wer the ends of the prie&s;ts and rulers.</P>
<P>THE common people among the <HI>Jews</HI> were the &s;ame as among all other nations, where their &s;pi|ritual guides keep them in ignorance of the &s;pirit of Divine in&s;titutions, ea&s;ily led by their &s;en&s;es, till they lo&s;e the u&s;e of them, and believed what was very fooli&s;h and &s;en&s;ele&s;s. They made an idol of their temple, and for&s;ook the God whom they ought to have wor&s;hipped there: They attributed &s;anctity to the very gold that adorned their holy place, but were far from &s;anctifying the Lord who pre&s;ided there in their hearts. From the mo&s;t horrid acts of cruelty and impiety, they went to the temple to wor&s;hip and to atone for the &s;in of their &s;ouls;
<PB N="247" REF="255">they at la&s;t went &s;o far as to offer the fruit of their bodies. Notwith&s;tanding all this impiety, their prie&s;ts and their rulers made them believe that they were the only cho&s;en people of God; and that the prophets, who threatened them in the name of the Lord for their &s;ins, were enemies to their happi|ne&s;s and the noble con&s;titution of their church and nation. Fired with re&s;entment again&s;t the prophets, by the in&s;tigation of their prie&s;ts and rulers, they murdered them, and few of the&s;e me&s;&s;engers of the Lord e&s;caped their bloody hands. Our <HI>Saviour</HI> tells them, <HI>They &s;toned them who were &s;ent unto them.</HI> Our Prophet faithfully reproves this nation and church for their departure from the &s;pirit of their law and religion, and calls their new &s;cheme of politics, <HI>An hatching of cockatrice eggs, or working for the king of &s;erpents,</HI> as the word &s;ignifies. He tells them openly and &s;incerely, that their pre&s;ent conduct was both deceitful and de&s;tructive; that however well they thought their &s;cheme of politics laid, it was all vain; that they had refined too much upon their &s;y&s;tem, and that it would prove at la&s;t like a &s;pider's web, a very empty thing; that this their wicked hypocri&s;y would ruin them at la&s;t, when <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> &s;hould ea&s;ily take them cap|tive, when they were mo&s;t &s;ecure.</P>
<P>THE words of our text give us the picture of a nation and people that were very &s;uper&s;titious, but very wicked. The idiom of the language points out the ugline&s;s of their character: The prophet de&s;cribes, in language &s;omething like the character, the ba&s;ene&s;s of that people's conduct: <HI>They hatch cockatrice eggs,</HI> were engaged in the &s;ervice of <HI>Satan,</HI> and working for him: This relates to the gradual progre&s;s of their &s;in and corruption: It was the effect of contrivance, and the fruit of wicked de|&s;igns. Sin comes not to perfection at once, but is like eggs that are fir&s;t hatched before they bring
<PB N="248" REF="256">forth the cockatrice. Their making religion a po|litical &s;y&s;tem was not fini&s;hed in one day; they came to the height of wickedne&s;s and deceit, by a gra|dual departure from the paths of truth and their original &s;y&s;tem. <HI>They weave the &s;pider's web,</HI> i. e. they do a very deceitful but vain thing: They were great hypocrites, but their hypocri&s;y could not defend them from the judgments of God. This phra&s;e &s;hews unto us how much they had refined upon their ungodly &s;y&s;tem, till it could not bear any weight; it was like a &s;pider's web, ready to be &s;wept away by &s;mall in&s;truments. Hypocri&s;y, how|ever well it may look, has no &s;trength in it to &s;e|cure men again&s;t the wrath of God, or the chal|lenges of con&s;cience. <HI>He who eateth of their eggs dieth; and that which is cru&s;hed, breaketh out into a viper:</HI> Such as are partakers with them in their &s;in, and join in their evil de&s;igns, &s;hall die in the com|mon judgment which &s;hall come upon them, or rather die to all &s;en&s;e of true religion and virtue. Such as dige&s;ts their principles &s;hall &s;uffer with them&s;elves, and tho&s;e who do not &s;o heartily em|brace them, but in the very hatching cru&s;h them like eggs, &s;hall notwith&s;tanding be &s;hortened there|with. Communion with men in &s;in is dangerous; it either produces death or great hurt. The word which is here rendered <HI>to eat,</HI> is rendered, <HI>Dan.</HI> vi. 24. <HI>To illuminate:</HI> For ordinarily hypocrites are great&s;landerers and calumniators. The&s;e <HI>Jews</HI> abu&s;ed the true &s;ervants of God with all the calumny and &s;lander they could; they not only took away their lives, but endeavoured to ruin their name and character al&s;o. The &s;in of this people the Prophet de&s;cribes from its ugly nature, and its ruinous effects: It was the &s;pecial cau&s;e of the Lord's for|&s;aking them, and giving them up to their enemies. <HI>The Lord delights in the upright, but makes the ta|bernacle of the hypocrite de&s;olate.</HI></P>

<P>IN handling this &s;ubject I &s;hall fir&s;t attempt to open up the fir&s;t branch of the character in the text, <HI>They hatch cockatrice eggs.</HI> 2dly, Con&s;ider the meaning of the phra&s;e, <HI>They weave the &s;pider's web.</HI> 3dly, Shew the danger of keeping com|munion with per&s;ons of &s;uch a character.

<P>THE fir&s;t thing in the method was to open up the meaning of the fir&s;t branch of the cha|racter in the text.</P>
<P N="1">1. SUCH as have given up them&s;elves to be &s;ervants to &s;in, are thereby inclined to pur&s;ue its plea&s;ures, by all the means of malignity and deceit. Sin is both a poi&s;on and &s;lavery to the &s;oul; it in|fects the whole man, &s;oul and body; it blinds the under&s;tanding, corrupts the will, di&s;orders the af|fections, and benumbs the con&s;cience. When men once engage in the practice of &s;in, the &s;mall know|ledge they naturally have decays, in proportion as the habit and practice of &s;in advanceth. This is ea&s;ily accounted for; the under&s;tanding grows in capacity, by an ob&s;ervance of the duties of the law of God: <HI>The law is a light unto the believer's feet, and a lamp unto his path.</HI> But &s;in is the re|ver&s;e of this law, and has the very oppo&s;ite effect: It is the way of darkne&s;s, in which men cannot &s;ee to walk, though they think they are walking uprightly. Sin, if once in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heart, bewilders the &s;oul: And &s;inners, like people gone wrong in a mi&s;t, are at a lo&s;s to know where they are: They are ready to think they are right when they are not, and congratulate them&s;elves in their progre&s;s in the way to heaven, when they are in the high way to hell and de&s;truction. Sin corrupts human will al&s;o; <HI>For the carnal mind is enmity a|gain&s;t God, and is not &s;ubject to the law of God, nei|ther indeed can be,</HI> Sin hath corrupted the will of
<PB N="250" REF="258">man, as to its liberty and ea&s;e, in chu&s;ing that which is good. Had man continued innocent he could have u&s;ed his liberty with ea&s;e and &s;atisfac|tion towards virtue and all her connexions; for goodne&s;s and purity would have been the objects which the &s;oul would have cho&s;en naturally: But &s;ince &s;in entered into the human heart, there is in it a pronene&s;s to evil, and a backwardne&s;s to that which is good: For though the will of man, when con&s;cience points out the way of righteou&s;ne&s;s, or the way to de&s;truction, may &s;eem to incline to the one more than the other, yet it &s;eldom inclines af|ter the means which direct to happine&s;s. The pro|pen&s;ity is inclined another way, and &s;o acts again&s;t the admonitions of con&s;cience. In this ca&s;e men exerci&s;e their will with unea&s;ine&s;s, and though they u&s;e their liberty, yet are they in bondage: For con&s;cience and their will often directs different ways, and creates pain to the &s;oul. When it happens, as it may &s;ometimes do, that one may make choice of what is materially good, becau&s;e it is agreeable to &s;ome pa&s;&s;ion or prejudice natural to his temper, yet does he not chu&s;e the good thing from motives that are good: So when &s;uch a per&s;on embraceth that which is good of it&s;elf, he doth it from motives which are ba&s;e and abominable. This is plain in the ca&s;e of <HI>Jehu,</HI> who de&s;troyed the hou&s;e of <HI>Ahab,</HI> and the wor&s;hip of <HI>Baal,</HI> which was accord|ing to the will of the Lord; but it was to have a kingdom and crown to him&s;elf, and not to plea&s;e the Lord he did it.</P>
<P>The will of man is always free, whether in a &s;tate of enmity with God, or in a condition of friend|&s;hip; but this liberty con&s;i&s;ts more in a de&s;ire to chu&s;e than in full embracing, in tho&s;e who are un|der the power of &s;in and prejudice; for a wicked man may greedily de&s;ire &s;inful objects, but as he cannot altogether get clear of con&s;cience, which
<PB N="251" REF="259">never will approve of chu&s;ing what is evil, &s;o he timidly embraceth what he greedily de&s;ires. Thus is not the will free, in a proper &s;en&s;e of liberty, to &s;uch as are thus re&s;trained in embracing what they greedily de&s;ire. And with re&s;pect to what is good, &s;uch is the corruption of the human will, though the mind may &s;ee nece&s;&s;ity to chu&s;e what is good and conducive to true happine&s;s, yet appetite and pa&s;|&s;ion is &s;o con&s;titutionally connected with the heart, that the de&s;ire inclines towards what is become mo&s;t con&s;titutional. Yet this is rather a thir&s;t in a raging fever, which is an effect of a di&s;ea&s;e, than the de|liberate fruit of rea&s;on and con&s;ideration. This error of the human will is owing to corruption of the human will.</P>
<P>SIN, in like manner, hath di&s;ordered the af|fections, and always will do &s;o, where it remains in its power and full force. When a propen&s;ity to &s;in and folly rules in the &s;oul, and the inclination is &s;trong to &s;inful objects, and con&s;cience checks the career of the pa&s;&s;ions, there ari&s;eth an inte&s;tine war, or rather a confu&s;ion in the &s;oul. Love of plea&s;ure, fear of puni&s;hment, hope of happine&s;s, and a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt are contra&s;ted &s;o, that the affections of the mind are not only di&s;ordered, by being directed to fal&s;e and wrong objects, but di&s;ordered in their direction to the very objects they are bent upon. This might be illu&s;trated in com|mon ob&s;ervation, if we con&s;ulted our own hearts, and the experiences of tho&s;e, who either are or have been under the power of &s;in. I &s;hall illu&s;trate this by con&s;idering two characters. The worldly pro|fe&s;&s;or of religion, and him who &s;inneth again&s;t the te&s;timony of his own con&s;cience, in any re&s;pect whatever.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE man who profe&s;&s;eth religion, but is un|der the influence of the world, and is directed in
<PB N="252" REF="260">all his views by worldly motives and rea&s;ons: His affections are mi&s;erably di&s;tracted betwixt the&s;e im|pre&s;&s;ions which religion now and then makes upon his mind, and that ardent regard he has to mam|mon. Such a per&s;on is not willing to forfeit a re|ligious character, for he has an affection to be thought religious, and he would at the &s;ame time gratify his worldly pa&s;&s;ion and affection. In the meantime his &s;oul is divided between the love of fame and the love of riches. Often it happens that his &s;ilent &s;lumbers depart from him, how to recon|cile, what is altogether irreconcileable, a chri&s;tian and a worldly character. When religion makes her ju&s;t demands upon him, it frets his &s;oul, becau&s;e it makes too free with his idol the world: When he would willingly quit religion and &s;acrifice to mammon alone, then love of fame and reputation among the religious puts him to a &s;tand: Thus he is to&s;&s;ed between different affections, till one may read in his very countenance the di&s;ea&s;e of his mind. The&s;e oppo&s;ite affections &s;ometimes come the length to &s;cold one another's objects. When the man is under the influence of his worldly pa&s;&s;ion in a &s;trong degree, he abu&s;eth religion, and throws up to her what expence &s;he has co&s;t him; he ac|cu&s;eth her friends for bringing him into a &s;nare, whereby he has &s;uffered lo&s;s, and ri&s;ked his cha|racter with the profitable world. When this &s;ally of affection is a little &s;ub&s;ided, the other pa&s;&s;ion, the love of reputation among the religious, recoils upon him; then he is ready to call his friends un|charitable, who blame him for his worldly temper of mind; he rages at them becau&s;e they will not join with him in reconciling intere&s;t and religion: Becau&s;e they cannot &s;ee any foundation to e&s;tabli&s;h the kingdom of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> upon the &s;ame ground with worldly intere&s;t, he exclaims again&s;t them as uncharitable bigots, and vents his &s;pleen again&s;t
<PB N="253" REF="261">them with the greate&s;t fury: And here again he is tormented with two oppo&s;ite affections, a de&s;ire to hope well of his own condition, and a de&s;ire to be friends with tho&s;e whom his con&s;cience tells him are enemies to <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> and his cau&s;e. The ef|fect of this di&s;order of affections is like its cau&s;e, &s;in in the heart, malignant and wicked: For it puts the poor di&s;tracted animal into &s;uch a madne&s;s, that he is ready to tear every character that is oppo&s;ite to his own: Like a bear bereaved of her whelps, he tears the innocent; or like a madman, he throws fire-brands, arrows and death.</P>
<P N="2">2. THOSE al&s;o who &s;in again&s;t the te&s;timony of con&s;cience, in other in&s;tances have a &s;ad di&s;order in their affections: Fears crowd in upon them, when they would willingly hope well of their condition. When they &s;eek to apply the promi&s;es to their pre|&s;ent condition, their con&s;ciences tell them they have no intere&s;t in them. The promi&s;es belong to them that are in <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> but their hearts tell them they do not love him, and con&s;equently have no intere&s;t in him. The&s;e affections of hope and fear divide the man, and he is racked between the two: He finds upon trial his hope is groundle&s;s, and his fears are too well founded, &s;o that for the mo&s;t part the i&s;&s;ue is final de&s;pair.</P>
<P>SIN al&s;o &s;tupifies the con&s;cience. That power of the &s;oul we call con&s;cience, is the la&s;t re&s;ult of the mind in reviewing all her operations, and either approving or condemning her&s;elf, according as &s;he finds them agreeable or di&s;agreeable to that law which the Almighty hath given for a rule to the whole man. This power of judging is often ren|dered indi&s;tinct, from the multitude of complicated thoughts, and compounded rea&s;onings. A variety of complex cau&s;es are frequently pre&s;ented to the con&s;cience, whereby it is difficult to appropriate a right judgment unto them. Attainments, and im|perfections,
<PB N="254" REF="262">motives and principles, the various degrees of each, come under con&s;ideration. Sins and duties, opportunities and ordinances, and the various u&s;es or abu&s;es of them, are al&s;o to be con|&s;idered. All the&s;e being rendered more compli|cated through the deceit of the human heart, it is difficult for the mind to judge of all that hath pa&s;|&s;ed in it for any &s;pace of time. For this rea&s;on, like a judge who hath a number of different cau&s;es all pre&s;ented to him at once, or a cau&s;e with many complex circum&s;tances, the con&s;cience is confu&s;ed, and cannot well either approve or di&s;approve for the time. For whatever power of comprehen&s;ion we may attribute to the con&s;cience, we cannot &s;ay its knowledge is infinite; and as it hath received its own &s;hare of depravity, its knowledge and power of judgment is but definite in its pre&s;ent capacity. It is &s;in that is the cau&s;e of this; for if there had been no tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, the mind would have had but one kind to &s;urvey; and if all actions and thoughts had been &s;imple, there would have been but two kinds, good and evil. But &s;in hath wrought &s;o much confu&s;ion in the &s;oul, that it is hard to find any thought which, as to its object, is not com|pounded.</P>
<P N="2">2. SIN makes men the very &s;laves of <HI>Satan.</HI> Every act of immorality is &s;lavery to the &s;oul, as thereby &s;he acts contrary to her original freedom, and fir&s;t de&s;ign of rationality. The de&s;ign of rea|&s;on and under&s;tanding was to imitate God in purity, perfection, and freedom of chu&s;ing what mo&s;t re|&s;embles him: But when men commit &s;in they bring them&s;elves under the tyranny of the king and prince of darkne&s;s; <HI>They hatch cockatrice eggs,</HI> or labour for the king of &s;erpents, as the words &s;ignfy. Sin is an ab&s;olute &s;lavery, as it never can be committed with freedom and ea&s;e. Men's lu&s;ts may force them to commit &s;in, again&s;t the
<PB N="255" REF="263">evidence of their own con&s;ciences; yet there will be a &s;truggle within the &s;oul, which even will make &s;in a bitter mor&s;el, to &s;uch as even eagerly pur&s;ue it. The plea&s;ure in the act is never equal to the after remor&s;e, fear and trouble, which at|tend it.</P>
<P>ALL &s;orts of &s;ins carry along with them a great &s;lavery. The man who follows after the world in an inordinate manner, what fears of di&s;appoint|ment perplex his mind; to have and to keep, di&s;|tre&s;s him continually: His heart like the hor&s;e|leach's daughters, cries always give, and never &s;ays it has enough. There is no &s;atisfaction in the pre|&s;ent enjoyment; for the covetous heart &s;till wants more, and the more it enjoys the more it would have, and craves the more.</P>
<P>HOW to keep what is acquired is al&s;o a di&s;tre&s;|&s;ing con&s;ideration; thieves and bankrupts haunt the covetous man's imagination night and day: When others enjoy re&s;t and repo&s;e, his di&s;tracted thoughts allow him no peaceful &s;lumbers, but &s;leep departs from his eyes. He is a drudge to this world, and knows not the &s;weets of liberty, nor ta&s;tes the benefits of rational freedom. The man of plea&s;ure is a &s;lave to his inordinate lu&s;ts. He would pre&s;erve a character among men, and yet enjoy his unlawful plea&s;ures; and between the&s;e two his judgment is upon the rack: Be&s;ides the di&s;tre&s;&s;es that attend this cour&s;e of life, bear hard upon him. His evil de&s;ires would pur&s;ue unlaw|ful plea&s;ures, but experiences &s;hew him that &s;ick|ne&s;s, di&s;tre&s;s, bitterne&s;s and remor&s;e will be the con&s;equence. The de&s;ire of plea&s;ure, and the fear of poverty, divide his &s;oul between them, &s;o that no part is left to him&s;elf; for he hath no &s;elf en|joyment: He is not his own ma&s;ter, he cannot do what he would: His de&s;ire per&s;uades him to gra|tify
<PB N="256" REF="264">his lu&s;t; his fears do check him lea&s;t he come to want and di&s;grace.</P>
<P>THUS when men pur&s;ue the ways of &s;in and folly, they are bond-&s;laves to <HI>Satan</HI> and their own lu&s;ts, and want that which truly makes them men of liberty, thought and action. But if at any time con&s;cience be awakened, and &s;ets their &s;ins and the ju&s;tice of God before their eyes, horror and fears take hold of them, and bring them into bondage. They are afraid of death, and have no peace while they are living; for their minds have not what they de&s;ire, and con&s;cience tells them if they &s;eek it they &s;hall peri&s;h: And it is no wonder, &s;eeing they act contrary to the de&s;ign of their nature.</P>
<P N="3">3. SIN is of a &s;ubtile nature. It penetrates like the poi&s;on of a &s;erpent: Though not ea&s;ily di&s;cern|ed at fir&s;t, it diffu&s;&s;eth it&s;elf through the whole man, &s;oul and body. The <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> compares it to the poi&s;on of a &s;nake, which though at fir&s;t it &s;eems to affect one part, runs by degrees through the whole body. Sin, though at fir&s;t it may &s;eem to re&s;ide in one di&s;po&s;ition of the mind, yet will in proce&s;s of time diffu&s;e it&s;elf through all the re&s;t. The covetous man at fir&s;t de&s;ires to have, but at la&s;t puts out his hand and &s;teals what belongs to his neighbour. The thief who intended to &s;teal, but not to murder, will before he is di&s;covered, embrue his hands in his neighbour's blood. The man that would only venture to the door of the harlot's hou&s;e, at la&s;t goes in and hath a dart &s;truck through his liver. So &s;ubtile a thing is &s;in, that if once begun, it hath no end; it &s;preads it&s;elf through the di&s;po&s;ition of the mind. <HI>It is like a little leaven which leaveneth the whole lump.</HI> No man is &s;afe who ventures to &s;in once, for it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;in once and not again: One &s;in opens the way for a train of other vices. If a man ventures to lie, he will do it again to conceal the fir&s;t, and go on pro|gre&s;&s;ively.
<PB N="257" REF="265">The apo&s;tle <HI>James</HI> tells us, that lu&s;t, when it is conceived, bringeth forth &s;in; and &s;in when it is fini&s;hed, bringeth forth death.</P>
<P>THE &s;ubtilty of &s;in will appear from its influence upon the particular thoughts of the heart, in order to actions: Where evil and vicious inclinations are once admitted into the mind, they gradually in|crea&s;e till they terminate in &s;ome wicked action, if occa&s;ion and opportunity come in the way. And frequently the man who only allowed an inordinate de&s;ire to take a little re&s;idence in his mind, hath by the concurrence of the de&s;ire and the opportunity proceeded to gratification, and con&s;ummated the evil de&s;ire by an evil action.</P>
<P>THE nature of all &s;in is to a&s;cend to an higher degree; and the better to lead on the unwary &s;in|ner, the tempter begins with what &s;eems &s;mall or indifferent at fir&s;t; makes as it were a lodgement in the &s;oul, and proceeds by &s;ap till the per&s;ons is un|dermined and made a con&s;ummate &s;inner. Like the poi&s;on of a &s;erpent, if once allowed to re&s;ide in one member it will poi&s;on the whole rational frame, and bring death and ruin upon both &s;oul and bo|dy. No man is &s;afe with the lea&s;t of this moral poi&s;on in his &s;oul: It wa&s;tes like a canker, and i&s;&s;ues in death.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, IT is &s;ometimes long before the evil principle comes to perfection. Many contrivances, plans and &s;chemes may be fallen upon before this deadly cockatrice is hatched. Sometimes it is car|ried on by one appearance, and &s;ometimes by another, but it always di&s;gui&s;eth its real character. Deceit will &s;ometimes wear the cloak of friend&s;hip, and he who intends no good, becau&s;e it is not in his power to do evil, will u&s;e the decoy of fair words, and &s;eem concerned for our intere&s;t, to lead us off our guard that he may ruin us when he gets an opportunity. Fair promi&s;es may, for a &s;ea&s;on,

<P><HI>Head</HI> 2. To open up the meaning of the phra&s;e; <HI>They weave the &s;pider's web;</HI> or, to explain the nature of hypocri&s;y under this figure of &s;peech:</P>
<P N="1">1. HYPOCRISY is a complex vice, made up of different materials. Many vices make up this one; like the &s;pider's web it is compo&s;ed of many threads. Athei&s;m and unbelief are ingredients in this dan|gerous compo&s;ition: For nothing can &s;avour more rank of athei&s;m than to conceal our real de&s;igns,
<PB N="259" REF="267">when we cannot but be certain that the all-&s;eeing eye of God is ever upon us. Every hypocrite is guilty of di&s;gui&s;ing his real character, for he &s;eldom loves to appear as he is, and this conduct carries in it the mo&s;t athei&s;tical &s;en&s;e imaginable; for who that believes that God &s;ees him would pretend to be what he is not, when he is &s;ure if there is a God he will bring all things to light, whether they be good or evil. If men can conceal their crimes from God, under any ma&s;k whatever, he may al&s;o, for aught they know, be ignorant of their wants al&s;o; and could not in that ca&s;e be the portion of his people. There is the greate&s;t athei&s;m in the conduct of hypocrites, and the greate&s;t contradic|tion: For when they profe&s;s religion they pretend to depend upon God, but when they are not what they appear to be, they render wor&s;hip to him that according to their own principles is not God. For if they can hide any thing from him he is not om|ni&s;cient, and therefore is not God; and thus one part of their conduct de&s;troys another.</P>
<P>UNBELIEF is another ingredient in hypocri&s;y. An hypocrite is an infidel, becau&s;e he doth not be|lieve the go&s;pel account of God's infinite knowledge. A believer of the Divine intelligence dare not hy|pocri&s;e, becau&s;e he is per&s;uaded nothing is hid from <HI>Jehovah,</HI> who&s;e eyes run to and fro to be|hold the hearts and ways of the &s;ons of men. Every man would be the &s;ame in his thoughts, words, and actions, at all times, and in all places, did they really believe the te&s;timony of God concerning hyporites. The Scripture is very plain upon the head of hypocri&s;y, and informs men of the hate|fulne&s;s of the &s;in, and awfulne&s;s of its con&s;equences. Job xv. 34. <HI>For the congregation of hypocrites &s;hall be de&s;olate.</HI> Job xxxvi. 13. <HI>The hypocrites in heart heap up wrath.</HI> Job viii. 13. <HI>The hypocrite's hope
<PB N="260" REF="268">&s;hall peri&s;h.</HI> Prov. xi. 9. <HI>An hypocrite with his mouth de&s;troyeth much good.</HI> Luke xii. 1. <HI>Beware of the leaven of hypocri&s;y.</HI> When the Divine te&s;timony is &s;o expre&s;s again&s;t deceit and hypocri&s;y, &s;peaks &s;o much of its evil, and &s;hews &s;o plainly the many threatnings denounced again&s;t it, &s;urely that man mu&s;t be an infidel who is guilty of hypocri&s;y.</P>
<P>IGNORANCE and knowledge are al&s;o componant parts of hypocri&s;y. Ignorance is an ingredient in hypocri&s;y; for if men were po&s;&s;e&s;t of true know|ledge they would not be hypocrites; and if they wanted it they could not be &s;uch. It is not po&s;&s;ible for men to be guilty of hypocri&s;y, if they knew God right, and under&s;tood his character truly, for the knowledge of God begets faith: <HI>They who know thy name will put their tru&s;t in thee,</HI> P&s;al. ix. 10. and this faith would naturally produce &s;incerity. It is ignorance of the true character of God which maketh men hypocritical and in&s;incere before him. Yet it mu&s;t be granted, that there are &s;undry men of under&s;tanding, as it is &s;o called by the world, who are hypocrites: For if they were void of knowledge altogether, or had not &s;ome competent mea&s;ure of under&s;tanding, they could not contrive how to di&s;gui&s;e them&s;elves, and hide and conceal their real character.</P>
<P>THIS knowledge which hypocrites have, is very defective in its nature, becau&s;e it never entereth in|to the nature of truth, nor the &s;prings of action in the human heart. The greate&s;t length that this hypocritical knowledge reacheth, is to the decorum of things, not to their nature and proper end. Hy|pocri&s;y hath its &s;pecial concern employed about the out-lines of religion, but never enters into the &s;pirit of it. Hypocrites attain to the under&s;tanding of what &s;ome call decency and order, or that part which the eyes of men behold: All the &s;hewey part of a religious character they under&s;tand, and &s;trive
<PB N="261" REF="269">to obtain; but as to the &s;pirit of real godline&s;s they know it not. Even the mo&s;t refined part of their hypocri&s;y, which concerns the mo&s;t &s;piritual part of their religion, or that which is likelie&s;t to real godli|ne&s;s, is a mixture of ignorance and knowledge. They are imperfect in all the parts of their reli|gious character. Their knowledge is only &s;ome perceptions which are common to every man who hath the means of under&s;tanding; which is far from that rational knowledge, founded upon compari&s;on of principles and drawing conclu&s;ions.</P>
<P><HI>They weave a &s;pider's web,</HI> or in other words, are hypocrites who depend upon &s;imple perceptions, and corporeal impre&s;&s;ions, and embrace the&s;e for true and rational religion. Simple perceptions, &s;uch as &s;eeing or hearing, may produce different effects upon our animal frame, &s;uch as fear, joy, and pain; as howling in the ear of a dog will make him howl al&s;o, and plea&s;ant melody will give plea|&s;ure, without any comparing of ideas, and yet there may be no religion upon the whole. Reli|gion is the right direction of our rea&s;on, or our ra|tional powers well directed by Divine truth: And this extendeth to every power and operation of the rational &s;oul, in a greater or le&s;&s;er degree: For this change that the truth makes, is a change of the whole powers of the human mind, and enables her both to perceive, compare, and judge according to truth. When men receive the feelings which ari&s;e from mere perceptions for the workings of divine power, they have no more religion, notwith|&s;tanding than other animals; and only deceive them&s;elves by taking perception for rea&s;on, or, if you will judge from one feeling as if there were many. Of this kind are enthu&s;ia&s;ts, who when any impre&s;&s;ion is made upon their fancy by &s;imple perception, they infer the &s;ame thing from it; which can only rea&s;onably be inferred from &s;undry
<PB N="262" REF="270">other feelings, &s;uch as judgment and rea&s;oning. This may be called, when applied to religion, the religion of animals; but can never be chri&s;tian, for chri&s;tianity teacheth us that religion is an ex|erci&s;e of the whole mind. I &s;hall not &s;ay that per|ception &s;imply is not knowledge, but only &s;ay it is not rational knowledge, but &s;uch as is competent to every animal. Rational knowledge ari&s;es from comparing our different feelings or perceptions, and making an e&s;timate of the relation they bear to one another, and the inference ju&s;tly drawn from this e&s;timation is true knowledge. But when men, without any e&s;timation at all, found their moral or religious characters upon any &s;imple feeling by it|&s;elf, they draw a fal&s;e picture of their character, and judge of them&s;elves erroneou&s;ly.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate this by examples from Scripture and ob&s;ervation, allow me to point out a few cha|racters of the kind already hinted at. The <HI>Laodi|ceans,</HI> mentioned <HI>Rev.</HI> 3. were people who imagin|ed them&s;elves high in the Divine favour, though they were in the &s;ight of the Almighty mi&s;erable and wretched. The enjoyment of privileges, and ea&s;e in the u&s;e of them, made them conclude the happine&s;s of their pre&s;ent condition from the feeling of ea&s;e, without ever enquiring into the connexion between that feeling and happine&s;s in the life to come. The account of them is, <HI>They thought them|&s;elves rich, and increa&s;ed with goods;</HI> were fond of their pre&s;ent condition, and dreamed of happine&s;s from their pre&s;ent feelings; when at the &s;ame time they were quite indifferent about moral truth and obligation. They were enthu&s;ia&s;ts as to their hopes, but lukewarm in their lives and practice. Their perception of pre&s;ent ea&s;e excluded all compari&s;on of their condition with the law of God. Had they exerci&s;ed their judgment and rea&s;on as well as their fancy, they would have found their fooli&s;h hopes
<PB N="263" REF="271">altogether groundle&s;s: For nothing can be a cer|tain rule of judgment concerning real happine&s;s but the divine word. And even men may receive the word it&s;elf erroneou&s;ly, if they receive immediate impre&s;&s;ions from it, without examination and judg|ment. It may happen that truth delivered in an agreeablene&s;s to our leading pa&s;&s;ion, may leave an agreeable feeling behind it, which is no more than happened to <HI>Ezekiel</HI>'s hearers: It may plea&s;e but not reform. Nothing but what pa&s;&s;eth through the judgment can reform the heart. Experience &s;hews us that the greate&s;t pretenders to immediate feelings, and who lay the greate&s;t weight upon an immediate intercour&s;e with heaven, have the mo&s;t unworthy notions of the Divine character, and the doctrines of the word of God.</P>
<P>THIS will appear evident when we con&s;ider that it is not the beauty of truth and &s;entiment that creates the perception, but the way in which it is expre&s;&s;ed. Plea&s;ing perceptions give delight, &s;uch as ari&s;e from mu&s;ic or beauty, but without rea&s;on and judgment: The plea&s;ure is only &s;en&s;itive and not rational. When men found their hopes and fears upon &s;uch plea&s;ing perceptions, without con|&s;idering what they relate to in matters of religion, they only weave a &s;pider's web: For when they think they believe the word of God, they only be|lieve their own &s;en&s;ations, and not what he hath revealed. However great preten&s;ions men may have to the Divine favour, and an experience in religion, if they receive not Divine truth as ju&s;t and rational &s;entiments, they have rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect them&s;elves to be hypocrites.</P>
<P>IF we examine a little farther into experience we will find that many have no more religion than what is founded upon &s;en&s;itive feeling, or the fer|vency of their animal motions. If at any time a plea&s;ant object happens to be repre&s;ented to the
<PB N="264" REF="272">eye, it begets a plea&s;ure which makes the imagina|tion go &s;o fa&s;t, that it either magnifies or multi|plies the object beyond reality, and from a fondne&s;s of the plea&s;ure, one who is not accu&s;tomed to rea|&s;oning believes all real before ever he examines in|to the nature of the object, or the impre&s;&s;ion it hath made upon the mind. This will hold al&s;o with re&s;pect unto di&s;agreeable repre&s;entations, and the fearful impre&s;&s;ions they produce. When men e&s;tabli&s;h their hopes and fears upon &s;uch feelings as ari&s;e from corporeal impre&s;&s;ions, they act without judgment, and however &s;trong either the one or the other may be, they are ready to be delu&s;ions. Such per&s;ons as have no other hope of happine&s;s but what is founded upon the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, are but very uncertain of their condition.</P>
<P>SIMPLE perception cannot certify us of moral truths; for though our &s;en&s;es are in&s;truments of conveying truth to the mind, it is the mind that compares the different perceptions let in by the &s;en&s;es, and that judges of their relation to one ano|ther. The te&s;timony of God in the word is re|ceived only when believed to be true and worthy of acceptation, and this reception ari&s;eth from ra|tional compari&s;on, which the mind only is capable of. To infer that we have received Divine truth, or believed the go&s;pel, when the plea&s;ure of the hearing is all the rea&s;on of our belief, is to do no more than the &s;trong ground hearers did, for they received the word with joy. The true rea&s;on of belief is truth, and the rational ground of plea&s;ure is the intere&s;t we have in it; and this is the object of moral con&s;ideration, or the re&s;ult of comparing our various feelings: This is the effect of free enquiry, and not of &s;imple perception: It is founded upon evi|dence, which is known only by judgment and trial, and which &s;imple perception cannot mea&s;ure, more
<PB N="265" REF="273">than one can mea&s;ure an unknown dimen&s;ion, with|out &s;ome means or intermediate rule.</P>
<P>UPON the whole it appears evident that &s;uch deceive them&s;elves, <HI>and weave a &s;pider's web,</HI> who re&s;t upon corporeal impre&s;&s;ions, without judgment and true under&s;tanding. For if we con&s;ider the way how our mind finds out the truth, it will ap|pear to be by u&s;ing her operations naturally, which are perception, judgment, and rea&s;on, the acqui|ring &s;imple notions, the comparing two, and mea|&s;uring them by a third, which con&s;titutes a full proce&s;s of rational exerci&s;e. In religion this exer|ci&s;e may be &s;lower or fa&s;ter according to the capa|city of the natural powers, or the mea&s;ure of evi|dence afforded, which &s;trengthens them; but then all true Divine knowledge in this our embodied condition, is attained to by this exerci&s;e: What is repugnant to this exerci&s;e of the mind is not religi|on but enthu&s;ia&s;m. Self-deceivers and hypocrites of all &s;orts are guilty in this particular, in found|ing their per&s;ua&s;ions of truth upon an imperfect or irregular exerci&s;e of the operations of the mind. When an awful truth is publi&s;hed, or a plea&s;ing one declared, &s;ometimes they produce the affections of fear or joy; but the&s;e affections ari&s;e more from the &s;uddenne&s;s of the intimation, and the a|greeablene&s;s or di&s;agreeablene&s;s of the manner of addre&s;s, than from any ju&s;t knowledge of the con|nexion between the intimation and fear and joy. The truths of the go&s;pel are no more to per&s;ons of this character than an intimation of the approach of an enemy, or the coming of a friend, by one who&s;e fidelity we know not. A whole city may be alarmed by a fal&s;e report, becau&s;e they do not ex|amine the me&s;&s;enger, or reject a true one for the &s;ame rea&s;on, and either become enthu&s;ia&s;ts through fear, or infidels through wilfulne&s;s and ob&s;tinacy. In like manner, many who hear the truths of the
<PB N="266" REF="274">Divine word mi&s;apply them, becau&s;e they do not &s;eriou&s;ly examine and con&s;ider them, and compare them with their pre&s;ent condition: They tremble when they have cau&s;e to rejoice, and rejoice when they have rea&s;on to tremble.</P>
<P>TRUE religion and philo&s;ophy agree in this, that both direct men to an orderly exerci&s;e of the rational powers; and hypocrites and enthu&s;ia&s;ts are neither chri&s;tians nor philo&s;ophers. When the go&s;pel changeth men's minds, it doth it by bring|ing them to con&s;ideration, and enables them to form better &s;entiments, yea &s;entiments altogether new; and the&s;e new &s;entiments are no more but Divine truths fixed on the &s;oul by true con&s;idera|tion. This con&s;ideration is the mind going through her operations, according to the natural end and u&s;e of them. It would be di&s;honourable to religi|on to &s;ay that it de&s;troyed the end for which we were made, which was to glorify God, by acting according to our nature: And it is certain, in an innocent &s;tate, that the mind of man received all truth by a natural exerci&s;e of her powers and ope|rations. Grace is then no more but a change of the error of the mind, and a putting it where it was at fir&s;t, with this addition of keeping it right. It may then as ju&s;tly be &s;aid, that &s;uch as embrace not Divine truth through the&s;e channels of know|ledge are under a delu&s;ion, and will at la&s;t, if they repent not, together with their web of delu&s;ion, be &s;wept into the bottomle&s;s pit.</P>
<P>HYPOCRISY is a compound of knowledge and ignorance. It would be impo&s;&s;ible for men if they were altogether ignorant to act the hypocrite, and if they were endued with true under&s;tanding they would not do it. When men are guilty of weav|ing this web of deceit, they have &s;ome under&s;tand|ing of the theory of truth, or they know how to expre&s;s them&s;elves in its language; they have learned
<PB N="267" REF="275">as much of its common principles in theory, as &s;erves them to conver&s;e with its friends in their own language: But then they are ignorant of the power and value of the truth, and &s;o u&s;e it only as an engine to &s;erve their purpo&s;e, or as a &s;nare to entrap the unwary. This knowledge of truth with which hypocrites are endowed, is not &s;uch an under&s;tanding of its principles as directs them to love and reverence the author, but is only a few common notices from reading or ob&s;ervation which they have collected to &s;erve their purpo&s;es. They receive not the truth in the love thereof, becau&s;e they are ignorant of its true value, and have no more under&s;tanding of it than extendeth to worldly purpo&s;es, and political advantages.</P>
<P>HYPOCRITES are like &s;ome &s;matterers in &s;cience, who are not thoroughly learned, nor yet quite igno|rant. They know &s;ome truths partially, but under|&s;tand not the &s;y&s;tem; and becau&s;e of their want of capacity to be thoroughly learned, they through di&s;|gu&s;t abu&s;e the little knowledge which they have to bad purpo&s;es. This deficiency of knowledge which prevails in hypocrites, con&s;i&s;ts of the want of under|&s;tanding of the intrin&s;ic value of truth; for no ra|tional being, who rightly under&s;tood the nature and value of truth, would make any other u&s;e of it but to &s;erve the Author of it. Their ignorance con|&s;i&s;ts in not knowing how to apply it to its proper ends and purpo&s;es. Through want of a true know|ledge of truth, they are not afraid to u&s;e it to all the purpo&s;es of deceit; and becau&s;e they have &s;ome &s;uperficial traces of it in their heads, they are ca|pacitated to make u&s;e of it to the ends of wickedne&s;s and di&s;&s;imulation.</P>
<P>MEN who have not dige&s;ted the truth thorough|ly, but received the principles of religion as a way of thinking, through ignorance of the value of true chri&s;tianity, pervert it to the purpo&s;es of $word$
<PB N="268" REF="276">advantage, attending that way of thinking. It is evident they have &s;ome knowledge, but know not as they ought to know; for it is one thing to know religion in theory, and another thing to know it &s;o as to practi&s;e it. The one is like that knowledge where|by a per&s;on can give a very good account of the rea&s;on of a thing, but when called to execute it, cannot perform any part of it; the other like him, who though he can but rea&s;on imperfectly, can per|form completely. The one's knowledge con&s;i&s;ts in thinking, but the other's con&s;i&s;ts of both thinking and practice. Every hypocrite is a compound of ignorance and &s;ome knowledge, for without both there can be no hypocri&s;ing. Knowledge makes a man capable of deceit, but ignorance makes him ri&s;k his happine&s;s in the adventure. No man, who knows as he ought to know, would ri&s;k the danger that attends deceit and hypocri&s;y.</P>
<P N="2">2. HYPOCRISY fixes upon a fal&s;e foundation. For <HI>want of the knowledge of the truth as it is in</HI> Je&s;us, every hypocrite <HI>builds his hou&s;e upon the &s;and.</HI> The very fir&s;t principles of their experience are founded upon fal&s;hood. Fal&s;e Notions of peace and the Divine character, are the principles of their de|luded experience. Like the <HI>Spider,</HI> who hath been long to&s;&s;ed with wind and &s;torm without, at la&s;t reaches the palace, and as <HI>Solomon</HI> expre&s;&s;eth it, <HI>taketh hold with her hands, and is in king's palaces;</HI> builds her hou&s;e, weaves her web, and ba&s;ks with plea&s;ure in her new habitation; never reflecting up|on the precarious right &s;he hath to her new &s;itua|tion, &s;he weaves her web with &s;ecurity.&mdash;But at la&s;t the broom &s;weeps away her web, and then &s;he is taught her error. Many who have led a vicious cour&s;e of life, being alarmed with the intimations of the word, and their own con&s;cience, through the pain and unea&s;ine&s;s they feel in their own mind for &s;ins they have committed, and for fear of Divine
<PB N="269" REF="277">vengeance, change their cour&s;e of life all in a &s;ud|den; and becau&s;e they have changed their actions, but not their di&s;po&s;itions, they <HI>&s;peak peace to their &s;ouls,</HI> and enjoy ea&s;e. They found their hope of happine&s;s not upon a real change of &s;entiment, but upon &s;ome alteration in their external conduct. They are the &s;ame in their heart, if their fears would &s;uffer them to act. They are like a <HI>Lion</HI> in chains, which retains &s;till its old di&s;po&s;ition to cruelty. From the ea&s;e they find from a change of action, they con|clude that their hearts are changed al&s;o; but all the difference of their condition lies in this, that in&s;teed of doing things bad in them&s;elves, they do good things badly. The &s;ame principle that inclined them before to do evil, di&s;po&s;eth them now to do good. Self-&s;atisfaction, and a love to plea&s;e them|&s;elves, was the leading principle to vice before, and &s;elf-ea&s;e and plea&s;ure is the &s;ame actuating principle with them &s;till. In this re&s;pect a man may pray, for the &s;ame rea&s;on he cur&s;ed or &s;wore before. Self-intere&s;t and plea&s;ure, or love of ea&s;e, will make men change their cour&s;e of action when there is no change in their inward &s;entiments. <HI>Jehu</HI> was zeal|ous for the Lord in his actions, but the leading mo|tive with him was &s;elf-intere&s;t. When men change a cour&s;e of action which has been both vitious and ab&s;urd, they may imagine they are inwardly re|formed, when the &s;ame principles remain in full force in their heart. This is in Scripture called, a <HI>crying peace; peace, when there is no peace. Job</HI> in|forms us that <HI>the hypocrite hath hope,</HI> though it <HI>&s;hall peri&s;h.</HI> This hope of happine&s;s is founded o$ de|lu&s;ionary principles; upon a change of action, with|out a change of principle, or upon a changing of one evil cour&s;e of life for one not &s;o obnoxious. Experience teacheth us that &s;ome who have been notable patrons of open immorality, have through the bitterne&s;s of remor&s;e changed their cour&s;e of
<PB N="270" REF="278">open prophanity to a cour&s;e of more refined iniqui|ty, and concluded the goodne&s;s of their condition from this alteration. Yea, &s;ome have by this means pa&s;&s;ed them&s;elves upon the world as converts to Godline&s;s, that they might have it in their power to work more profitable wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>OF this kind are all tho&s;e, who make a &s;udden tran|&s;ition from the coar&s;er part of <HI>Satan</HI>'s &s;ervice, and embrace a religious cour&s;e of life to &s;erve him with more refinement. They &s;uddenly change the mark of their ma&s;ter from their foreheads to their hands, and in&s;tead of following a cour&s;e of open wicked|ne&s;s, they change it for a cour&s;e of refined hypo|cri&s;y. This hypocri&s;y is founded upon a mi&s;taken notion of conver&s;ion. It is the opinion of the&s;e re|ligious &s;ervants of the Devil, that conver&s;ion is no more but a change from horror to peace and tran|quility, and that when ever a man has been badly enough frighted; the fir&s;t ea&s;e is genuine peace. They as &s;oon as their panick is over &s;ing a <HI>requiem</HI> to their &s;ouls, never con&s;idering what motives influenced them to this cour&s;e of life. And thus, though they be cen&s;orious, uncharitable, and &s;landerers of others, this pretended conver&s;ion atones for all. They are the children of God, and therefore may play the devil when they will with all that differ from them in opinion or &s;entiment. The foundation of their delu&s;ive hopes of a&s;&s;urance, is al&s;o founded upon a fal&s;e view of the Divine character. His Mercy and Grace, and that power which they have heard at|tributed to him in the conver&s;ion of &s;inners, they appropriate to them&s;elves, and conclude that Divine power and mercy hath effected that change which they now have made, and therefore hope in God according to their own view of his character, though it be altogether fal&s;e. Becau&s;e they have felt fear, and now enjoy peace, they conclude it to be <HI>the peace of God that pa&s;&s;eth all under&s;tanding;</HI> never
<PB N="271" REF="279">con&s;idering that this partial view of the Divine character can give hope to none. For although he be merciful, he is al&s;o a God of truth, and will ne|ver favour hypocri&s;y and deceit.</P>
<P>BY attributing to God the honour of that change which they have felt in them&s;elves, they think he is obliged to &s;ucceed it with all other Divine advanta|ges. They both father this &s;purious brat of the father of lies upon the God of truth, and think him obliged to them for being &s;o tractable as to be con|verted. They account it a mercy that God has now made them change a cour&s;e of open wicked|ne&s;s, for a life of &s;ecret iniquity, and hope that now his mercy will never for&s;ake them. This fooli&s;h vain conceit is founded upon as vain a no|tion of the Divine character, that &s;eeing they are now his friends, which at the &s;ame time they have no evidence for, they hope, though they indulge &s;ecret &s;in, he is &s;till obliged to &s;ave them. More|over they found their hopes of happine&s;s, and a&s;&s;ure them&s;elves of the Divine favour upon a mo&s;t par|tial belief of the truth. The&s;e truths relating to the character and offices of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> they mi|&s;erably &s;eparate and divide, and yet hope, <HI>though they walk in the imagination of their own hearts.</HI> Many of the&s;e hypocritical a&s;&s;urances, which pa&s;s for current &s;alvation among &s;undry deluded enthu|&s;ia&s;ts, are founded upon a prepo&s;terous divi&s;ion of Divine truth. They will allow that the Grace of God converted them, and the Blood of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> re|deemed them, but yet refu&s;e the perpetual efficacy of both God's Grace and <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Blood. Though they are unequal for conver&s;ion, they have yet the a&s;&s;urance to to &s;ay, that the increa&s;e of their virtue is owing to their own power. And though God is &s;o powerful as to convert them in &s;pite of their pre|judices, yet he is not able to keep them in that good &s;tate he brings them into. Thus they fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h
<PB N="272" REF="280">free Grace and then de&s;troy it. Their belief of the truth is quite partial, and they have not an univer|&s;al re&s;pect to the whole of Divine revelation. This is evident from the avowed principles of the&s;e con|verts to hypocri&s;y: For they with the greate&s;t zeal maintain the irre&s;tability of Divine Grace in their fir&s;t conver&s;ion, and as zealou&s;ly refute its perpe|tual energy in their after-life. There is &s;omething very wonderful in this dream, that the Grace of God &s;hould grow weaker by exerci&s;e, and &s;hould be able to conquer an enemy, and not be able to &s;ecure a friend. We are certainly as much obliged to believe that believers are kept by the Power of God through faith unto &s;alvation, as we are obliged to believe that <HI>we are ju&s;tified freely by his Grace through the redemption that is in</HI> Je&s;us.</P>
<P>THIS web of hypocritical conver&s;ion, is founded upon a &s;inful &s;eparation of what God hath joined together, <HI>free ju&s;tification through the redemption that is in</HI> Je&s;us, and the promi&s;ed a&s;&s;i&s;tance made to his people, <HI>to keep them in his ways. I have loved you with an everla&s;ting love, therefore with loving kindne&s;s will I draw you; I will put my &s;pirit within you; I will give you a new heart, and ye &s;hall never depart from me.</HI> Is it po&s;&s;ible that the&s;e per&s;ons can be converted to the truth that &s;o evidently deny it, or can that man have any &s;ure hope of &s;alvation who receives not the whole revealed coun&s;el of God. But hypocri&s;y is ever full of contradiction. What can be more contradictive, than to pretend to be what we are not? To hope for happine&s;s and not <HI>receive the truth in the love thereof?</HI></P>
<P>WHEN fir&s;t a &s;en&s;e of remor&s;e begins to appre|hend them, and con&s;cience dictates from the no|tices it hath received from the word of God a great number of horrible things, they are then ready to take the readie&s;t relief. When <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is revealed in the Go&s;pel as a Saviour and Redeemer, who <HI>de|livers
<PB N="273" REF="281">&s;inners from the wrath to come,</HI> the&s;e converts are ready to flee to him at fir&s;t notice, as one who can give them ea&s;e from pre&s;ent pain; but at the &s;ame time they never enquire into his character fur|ther, nor con&s;ider the nature of his kingdom. They are plea&s;ed with as much of a Saviour as will give them immediate ea&s;e from the challenges of an ac|cu&s;ing con&s;cience, but have not yet thought upon the purity of his Laws. All the view they have of &s;in is that it will bring them into condemnation, the vilene&s;s of it never gives them pain. For this rea|&s;on they receive not <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in all his offices, but would willingly only have him as a Saviour to &s;et them free from mi&s;ery. Having heard that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> delivers from wrath and condemnation, they then work up their minds to a conceit that they have received him, and then their con&s;ciences become quiet, and they enjoy re&s;t. This &s;udden calm they take as a progno&s;tic of every thing that is good, and conclude that they are now converted; and in|deed they are &s;o in a certain &s;en&s;e: They are con|verted from a condition of fear and horror into a condition of &s;elf-conceit, and fal&s;e peace. Now they, like the <HI>Spider,</HI> weave their web of fal&s;e expe|rience, upon a fooli&s;h conceit that they are the chil|dren of God. Now they triumph in a garment of their own righteou&s;ne&s;s, which they mi&s;take for the <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s of</HI> Chri&s;t. And many re&s;t here and never advance any further, till death &s;weeps their delu&s;ive web of fal&s;e experience and them&s;elves into the bottomle&s;s pit.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, hypocri&s;y makes men receive a fal&s;e rule of judging of them&s;elves. Hypocrites judge of their condition prepo&s;terou&s;ly, by &s;eeking grace within them before they look to their ways and actions. Upon this fal&s;e rule of judgment, they found their fal&s;e and delu&s;ive hopes of happine&s;s.&mdash; For though their lives be no way conformable to
<PB N="274" REF="282">the laws of Chri&s;tianity, they tru&s;t upon &s;omething they call grace in their hearts; but what this &s;ome|thing is, no man but them&s;elves can under&s;tand. The rule our Saviour hath left, to judge of men's &s;tate by, is of a different nature, <HI>by this &s;hall all men know that ye are my di&s;ciples, if ye keep my command|ments.</HI> But the hypocrites have no larger preten|&s;ions to good works than others, yet they excel all men for preten&s;ions to Grace and the Divine favour. On the account of this unknown &s;omething they have given the name of Grace to, they hope for all things, and make a monopoly of the Divine favour to them&s;elves. But what a fal&s;e way of judging is this, to &s;eek the cau&s;e before it can be evidenced by the effects of it. One may as well pretend to a&s;|cend to heaven, or &s;ome di&s;tant region to find that there is a God, and then come back and prove that he made the world. The be&s;t way of judging of the reality of our grace is from our love, which is evidenced by keeping God's commandments.</P>
<P N="3">3. HYPOCR$SY con&s;i&s;ts in drawing fal&s;e repre|&s;entations to the con&s;cience. Con&s;cience will ever be faithful in marking what pa&s;&s;es in the mind, but may &s;ometimes be mi&s;taken as to the object repre|&s;ented: A fal&s;e likene&s;s may deceive it. When objects pa&s;s through a deluded imagination, and are either magnified or dimini&s;hed, mutilated or en|crea&s;ed, the con&s;cience may not &s;o &s;oon &s;ee through the di&s;gui&s;e. Though we may &s;uppo&s;e a parent to know his own child, yet if the child act in di&s;gui&s;e, and feign a different character, the parent may not know his own offspring in this character. Though our con&s;cious power will ever ob&s;erve moral good and evil fairly repre&s;ented, yet a delu&s;ive imagina|tion may draw the picture of fal&s;hood &s;o like truth, that reflection cannot ea&s;ily di&s;cern the difference. A fal&s;e repre&s;entation of terrible objects may much &s;tartle con&s;cience, and cau&s;e fear where there is no
<PB N="275" REF="283">real danger, and a deceitful appearance of an ami|able one, may calm it into peace when there is the greate&s;t rea&s;on of fear. Often a fal&s;e report of im|pending danger makes us afraid when there is no truth in the te&s;timony; and often a &s;pecious report of agreeable tidings will flatter us into joy, when all is fictitious and nothing real. A delu&s;ive fancy, or a giddy imagination, may paint the objects of ter|ror or joy in the &s;tronge&s;t point of light, from ma|terials that never were de&s;igned for any &s;uch pur|po&s;e, and impre&s;s fear or joy upon the mind which are quite groundle&s;s and imaginary. This is the rea&s;on why many have fears and hopes which are altogether without foundation: This is the rea&s;on why many are frightened that were never convin|ced, and many wrapt up in tran&s;ports of joy, that were never converted. Men receive the notices of fancy and imagination, without examining the na|ture of the object, or the truth of the repre&s;entation, and &s;atisfy them&s;elves with a whim&s;ical plea&s;ure, or di&s;tre&s;s them&s;elves with an unrea&s;onable fear. In this re&s;pect men may be hypocrites without de&s;ign, as well as with it. For when the cau&s;e of the fal&s;e repre&s;entation is without them, it may leave its im|pre&s;&s;ion upon the imagination involuntarily, which in&s;en&s;ibly becomes a habit and grows con&s;titutional. This is ordinarily the ca&s;e with the&s;e per&s;ons who have the misfortue to be under the influence of en|thu&s;ia&s;ts: For though they would never have been in &s;uch circum&s;tances, had they not had the&s;e phan|toms &s;o often repeated unto them, yet from their connection with &s;uch per&s;ons, and their opinion of them, they fall in&s;en&s;ibly in love with what they often repre&s;ent. They are led into &s;elf-deceit by external cau&s;es, and into a good or bad opinion of their condition from the repre&s;entations that are by outward cau&s;es made upon their imaginations. Yet they are no le&s;s hypocrites on that account, be|cau&s;e
<PB N="276" REF="284">they do not intend it; for whoever is not what he appears to be, is an hypocrite whether he he knows it or not.</P>
<P>HYPOCRITES are of two &s;orts, &s;uch as deceive their con&s;ciences with repre&s;entations of their own forming, by working up their imagination to a cer|tain pitch of delu&s;ion, and per&s;uading their minds that the phantom is a real object; and &s;uch as are in&s;en&s;ibly led into that deceit without any de&s;ign of being &s;o. The one are de&s;igning, the other oc|ca&s;ional hypocrites: Yet neither are what they ap|pear to be; both pretend to the Divine favour from their fal&s;e feelings, but neither of them un|der&s;tand the true terms of acceptance with God. Impre&s;&s;ions upon the mind, that are not directed by judgment and free enquiry, are of no more con|&s;ideration in religion, than dreams are in common life. They who do not receive truth according to the rational operations of the human &s;oul, and the rules of right rea&s;on, may boa&s;t of their inter|cour&s;e with the Almighty as they plea&s;e, but have no rea&s;on to conclude any thing certainly. Divine truth though it effects a &s;upernatural change in the &s;oul, in point of &s;entiment, yet it does not change the nature of her operations. Truth comes, not directly and intuitively into the &s;oul, but pa&s;&s;eth through all the powers of perception, judgment, and ratiocination. When the mind is renewed by the truth, it is by the truth &s;anctifying all the powers thereof, and enabling it to exerci&s;e all its various operations. In this our imperfect &s;tate we cannot under&s;tand truth but by rea&s;oning and en|quiry: And this we often pervert to bad ends and purpo&s;es. Divine truth, when it takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our minds, directs our rea&s;on right, and cau&s;eth us to judge of objects truly and rationally. As all we know of the will of God concerning our happine&s;s and duty is delivered in a Te&s;timony, and this Te&s;|timony
<PB N="277" REF="285">con&s;i&s;ts of &s;undry propo&s;itions; the&s;e propo|&s;itions mu&s;t enter into our mind, according to the &s;tated method of knowledge, by perception, judg|ment, and rea&s;on. All the &s;upernatural a&s;&s;i&s;tance we have rea&s;on to expect, is only to help us to per|ceive, judge, and rea&s;on aright, or to change our wrong perceptions, rectify our wrong judgment, and remove our fal&s;e rea&s;onings. There is no re|ligion without &s;uch a compari&s;on of the&s;e propo&s;i|tions which we receive to be truth. Perception of it&s;elf cannot judge of the truth of what is perceived; it may feel an impre&s;&s;ion, but cannot without judg|ment determine its propriety; and the mea&s;ure of two di&s;tinct feelings cannot be determined but by a third, which makes rea&s;on nece&s;&s;ary as well as perception and judgment. An impre&s;&s;ion ari&s;ing from a &s;ingle perception may be very delu&s;ive, un|le&s;s it is corrected by judgment. If one &s;hould for once be robbed upon a certain part in the high|way, by &s;ingle perception he would have the im|pre&s;&s;ion of a robbery upon his mind every time he came to that place, unle&s;s he was to compare and judge that robbers do not always keep the &s;ame place. Mo&s;t of animals have the &s;ame impre&s;&s;ions ari&s;ing from &s;imple perception, that if they have received any harm they fear it when they come to the &s;ame place.</P>
<P>OF con&s;equence tho&s;e who do not receive the truth as rea&s;onable propo&s;itions from enquiry and ju&s;t compari&s;on, cannot be &s;aid to under&s;tand it. I mean not that all believers mu&s;t go through a cour&s;e of formal logical rea&s;oning; but that what|ever method they take, they mu&s;t compare their feelings before they determine certainly concerning them. Without this they will be ready to form fal&s;e repre&s;entations to their con&s;ciences, and ei|ther fear or rejoice without any ju&s;t ground.</P>
<P>ALL the conver&s;ions we read of in the <HI>New Te&s;|tament,</HI>
<PB N="278" REF="286">con&s;i&s;ted not only in making men feel, but judge and di&s;cern, and it was by a ju&s;t e&s;timate of things they came to a &s;ettled condition of joy and peace. Even the three thou&s;and converted by <HI>Pe|ter</HI>'s &s;ermon, were converted by the exerci&s;e of judgment and rea&s;on. It was by the comparing the truth of <HI>Peter</HI>'s di&s;cour&s;e with their own ungod|ly practice, that made them cry, <HI>What &s;hall we do to be &s;aved.</HI> Without &s;uch a compari&s;on there could have been no ground or rea&s;on of compunction: And before they had any ground given them to expect peace and forgivene&s;s of &s;in, they were or|dered <HI>to repent.</HI> All this exerci&s;e &s;uppo&s;es a ju&s;t enquiry into the truth of what was &s;aid, which need|ed not to have been long, &s;eeing the facts charged upon them were &s;o recent. No immediate impul&s;e was at all nece&s;&s;ary, but a Divine concurrence with the ordinary means of &s;alvation. This terror which the&s;e converts were brought into, was not the effect of any &s;imple impre&s;&s;ion, but of the &s;tronge&s;t proof and conviction from matter of fact. <HI>Peter</HI> had clearly proved them guilty of the death of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and made evident that he was ri&s;en again, and in|ve&s;ted with all power to judge them, and call them to account; and they had all the rea&s;on in the world to believe, that in the condition they were in, they would meet with no favourable verdict.</P>
<P>THE object of the fear of the&s;e <HI>Jews,</HI> was real and not imaginary, there was no fal&s;e picture drawn before the eyes of their con&s;cience, but their cha|racter was really drawn to the life. But many en|thu&s;ia&s;tical hypocrites have made an improvement of the&s;e primitive conver&s;ions in favour of their &s;udden tran&s;itions from open prophanity to hidden iniquity, and have formed a fal&s;e repre&s;entation of peace to their con&s;ciences, when they have never been convinced of &s;in, nor determined to for&s;ake it. They have plea&s;ed them&s;elves with idols of their
<PB N="279" REF="287">own framing, and weaved a <HI>Spider</HI>'s web of hypo|cri&s;y out of their own imagination.</P>
<P>I SHALL now fini&s;h this &s;ubject, by comprehend|ing the la&s;t doctrinal head and the improve|ment both in one.</P>
<P N="1">1. FROM the preceding ob&s;ervations we may &s;ee what an evil thing religious deceit and hypocri&s;y is. It makes men abominable in the &s;ight of God, and the true&s;t &s;ervants of the evil one. Nothing is more offen&s;ive to the pure eye of God than this &s;in of hypocri&s;y: It is a practical denying of his Omni&s;cience, and a que&s;tioning his Divine intelli|gence. Who that believes that God &s;ees all things, would love to appear in any other character but his real one? Who would hide &s;in under a cloak of piety, that was per&s;uaded that the Lord would detect him &s;ometimes or other? The hypocrite is a practical athei&s;t, and a &s;ecret denier of God. What an evil mu&s;t hypocri&s;y be, that makes men act &s;uch an irrational part with &s;o much impudence? That religion which is the glory of men, that profe&s;&s;ion that di&s;tingui&s;hes the lovers of God from the world, the hypocrite makes u&s;e of to di&s;honour him: By this he impo&s;es upon men, and often gains a cha|racter he has no title unto. But this vice is evil when we con&s;ider the threatnings denounced a|gain&s;t it; <HI>The hope of the hypocrite &s;hall peri&s;h,</HI> all their vain confidences &s;hall fail them when they need them mo&s;t, and what they have &s;o long <HI>rolled as a &s;weet mor&s;el under their tongue,</HI> will prove their poi&s;on at la&s;t; fearfulne&s;s &s;hall &s;eize them, though they may &s;upport them&s;elves with fal&s;e confidence for a while.</P>
<P>HYPOCRITES are <HI>Satan</HI>'s politicians who manage the &s;tate of his kingdom here below by the hidden policy of hell. To &s;erve their ma&s;ter they turn them&s;elves into all &s;hapes, and a&s;&s;ume all charac|ters. They intermeddle with all things &s;acred and
<PB N="280" REF="288">prophane to promote their ma&s;ter's intere&s;t. The ba&s;e&s;t of things are not below them, and the high|e&s;t are not above them; <HI>they hatch Cockatrice eggs, and weave the Spider's web,</HI> labour in the dunghill of immorality, and a&s;pire as high as the &s;ublime&s;t parts of religion. Nothing is either too high or too low for them to promote the kingdom of dark|ne&s;s: At the &s;ame time they a&s;cend the heights of religious enthu&s;ia&s;m, they deba&s;e the human un|der&s;tanding. No contradiction is &s;o ab&s;urd but they will fall into it, and &s;trive to reconcile it: They will attempt to reconcile knowledge and ignorance, light and darkne&s;s, and &s;ub&s;titute one thing in the room of another however incon&s;i&s;tent; immediate impre&s;&s;ions and impul&s;es in&s;tead of Divine revela|tion, and rule their conduct by fancy, and reject Divine truth. Hypocri&s;y directs men to run into all confu&s;ion, to invert all the Divine appointments of the Mo&s;t High. It will lead them &s;o far as to de&s;pi&s;e ordinances authenticated by heaven, and follow the inventions of human impo&s;ture. It will make tho&s;e who cannot read attempt to preach; and &s;uch as for ever err, exhort others to righteou&s;|ne&s;s. It will cau&s;e tho&s;e who are laden with &s;ins and iniquities profe&s;s they have not &s;inned for many years, and make imperfect mortals affirm they can attain to perfection in this life. Hypocri&s;y, in a word, can do all things that are bad, but no good things at all. It is the bane of &s;ociety, and the ruin of every individual who hath it.</P>
<P N="2">2. IT is evident from what hath been ob&s;erved above, that we ought carefully to examine all ap|pearances before we lay any dependence upon them. It is not every pretence to religion and the Divine favour that will be approved of by the Almighty; nor are all &s;uch his friends who &s;ay they are &s;o. Many refinements are made upon religion by crafty and de&s;igning per&s;ons. They have no other de|&s;ign
<PB N="281" REF="289">in all their pretences to piety and good mean|ing, but to &s;erve their pride, their intere&s;t, or party. The kingdom of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> among &s;uch, is made a political engine to &s;erve the pride or advantage of tho&s;e who &s;et up to be ma&s;ter of the ceremonies of each department. When religion it&s;elf is not the chief enquiry, and allowed to be the privilege of every individual, the&s;e who are be&s;t capable to mix religion with human inventions, are ever ready to cry out for its intere&s;ts, as thereby their own in|tere&s;t is fir&s;t &s;erved: Becau&s;e gain attends a certain form of godline&s;s, they are zealous for religion for the &s;ake of that gain.</P>
<P>HAD we not great need to examine all appear|ances when &s;o many &s;trange phaenomena appear. When &s;o many refined webs of hypocri&s;y are formed by different pretenders to religion and godline&s;s, had not every one need to try every man's preten&s;ions if they are well authenticated or not. In the&s;e days of &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s and hypocri&s;y, many various &s;hapes of religion and opinion pre|&s;ent them&s;elves, mo&s;tly all tending to encrea&s;e the pride or intere&s;t of the devotee; cau&s;ing them to hate all others that differ from, or who cannot go the &s;ame length with them&s;elves. Some have no more religion than what is contained in this or the other church e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, and think there is no &s;alvation to any who are not in full communion with &s;ome national church; others are di&s;&s;enters becau&s;e they cannot get the length to be chief ma&s;ters of the ceremonies, and are grieved at no|thing more than that they are di&s;&s;enters.&mdash;They &s;igh and cry, fa&s;t and mourn, becau&s;e the civil ma|gi&s;trate will not permit them to cut as many throats as they have &s;worn to do. For this very rea&s;on they envy men the favour of civil protection, and bla&s;pheme again&s;t a toleration of religious opinions. And what is wor&s;e, they grudge men the favour of
<PB N="282" REF="290">the Almighty, becau&s;e they walk not in their path. They pray for a reviving of religious per&s;ecution, and &s;wear to do it when it is in their power; and becau&s;e Providence has been &s;o kind to mankind as to re&s;train their power, it is no &s;mall degree of mortification to their pride, and no little degree of religious exerci&s;e to their &s;ouls. What a <HI>hatching of Cockatrice eggs</HI> is this, to envy men the indul|gence of the civil power to &s;erve God as their con|&s;cience directs them? There can be no medium between want of toleration and per&s;ecution. What a vengeance would it be to the&s;e realms if &s;uch hy|pocrites had their de&s;ires. My brethren and fel|low chri&s;tians, let us try every man's preten&s;ions by the Law and the Te&s;timony, and judge for our|&s;elves, whether they &s;peak according unto it. Let us con&s;ider our liberty, and never be entangled in the <HI>Spider</HI>'s web of eccle&s;ia&s;tical tyranny, whether ingrafted upon the civil con&s;titution, or a&s;&s;umed by Reverend religious gentlemen to keep the poor vulgar in &s;ubjection. Tyranny and impo&s;ition of all kinds is the &s;ame; and if once we give up the right of private judgement, it is of no great con&s;equence to whom we give our&s;elves up to be led in religious matters. When there are &s;o many &s;chemes of &s;elf-&s;eeking and religious webs of deceit pa&s;&s;ing current in the age, is it not every one's duty, for his own pre&s;er|vation, <HI>to enquire after the good old way, that he may find re&s;t to his &s;oul.</HI> Men who find their account in your ignorance and &s;implicity, will claim an ex|clu&s;ive privilege to judge in &s;ome matters of chri&s;|tianity; but believe them not, &s;uffer not your&s;elves to be brought under the power of any. If any number of men whatever, of whatever order, how|ever reverend and learned, claim a power of dicta|ting to you in any particular, or want to take &s;o much trouble off your hand as to compo&s;e your creed for you; &s;ay to &s;uch, <HI>take heed to your&s;elves.</HI>
<PB N="283" REF="291">Receive no lords but <HI>Chri&s;t:</HI> No creeds but the Scriptures.</P>
<P>THERE is great need of enquiry, when there are &s;o many pretenders, and all of them pretend|ing to high degrees of purity and good-meaning: Claiming the Scripture for their foundation, and the rule of their direction in all their extravagan|ces. Meetings of holy Fathers, and Reverend brethren when a&s;&s;embled, have been at the pains to dictate to us (as they pretend) out of the Scrip|tures, how much we &s;hould believe; and are ever very angry when the common people are di&s;po&s;ed to differ from them, and judge for them&s;elves. Such as have given them&s;elves to their direction are in abject &s;lavery as to matters of con&s;cience; and the&s;e gho&s;tly guides &s;trive to maint$in their own importance, merely becau&s;e they find their account in their &s;uperiority. But con&s;ider, my friends, that an Apo&s;tle did not aim &s;o high; we are not, &s;ays he, <HI>Lords of your faith, but helpers of your joy.</HI> The Apo&s;tles of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> could demean them|&s;elves, &s;o as to think and act with the meane&s;t vul|gar. They a&s;&s;umed no airs of importance nor &s;u|periority over the flock of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> but in <HI>meekne&s;s and lowline&s;s,</HI> like their Lord and Ma&s;ter, <HI>were ex|amples of true humility.</HI> Where they u&s;ed any au|thority, they did it by the immediate direction of the Holy Spirit, with which they were in&s;pired, which was promi&s;ed unto, and peculiar to them as Apo&s;tles. They &s;ubjected their doctrine and con|ver&s;ation to the examination of all, and exhorted their followers <HI>to try all things, and hold that which was be&s;t.</HI> They never a&s;&s;umed a power di&s;tinct from the whole Church, to judge exclu&s;ively of ei|ther doctrines or morals; and even though they were in&s;pired Apo&s;tles, they took in the common
<PB N="284" REF="292">people along with them in matters of judgment. <HI>Acts</HI> xv. 1, 2, 3.</P>
<P>MANY of you have been educated in a nation where religious &s;ubjection to clergy men is account|ed of Divine right; and where tho&s;e who are cho|&s;en to be publick &s;ervants, pretend to have right from the Deity to be ma&s;ters and lords of men's con&s;ciences.&mdash;But enquire and &s;ee if they have any ju&s;t claim to their preten&s;ions, and &s;tudy to be &s;atisfied in your own minds about what is truth before you acquie&s;ce in any man's opinion.</P>
<P N="3">3. WE are taught from the preceding di&s;|cour&s;e, that religious deceit is very &s;ubtile, and not ea&s;ily perceived, and on that account more dan|gerous to the &s;ouls of men. Our Prophet paints it in &s;uch colours that &s;hew its &s;ubtilty: <HI>They weave the &s;pider's web, they hatch cockatrice eggs.</HI> Though &s;ome may have other de&s;igns than religion in pro|pagating deceit; yet many may be deceived with|out meaning any deception to them&s;elves or others. Hypocri&s;y and deceit may involuntarily at fir&s;t gain a room in their imagination, and at la&s;t be|come an actual habit. Piety and good-meaning in&s;en&s;ibly &s;teal in upon the unwary; and for want of real principle, i&s;&s;ues in deceit and religious hy|pocri&s;y. Sins of every kind are &s;ubtile, little per|ceived at fir&s;t, but not ea&s;ily got clear off; like poi|&s;on, it diffu&s;eth it&s;elf through all the powers of the human under&s;tanding: It blinds the mind, hardens the heart, and &s;tupifies the con&s;cience. And when vice is cloathed in the habit and colour of religion, it mo&s;t ea&s;ily takes with the unwary: They &s;ee the bait, but not what is concealed under it.&mdash;When men are once deceived them&s;elves, they often &s;trive to make pro&s;elites to deception, and in proce&s;s of time become down-right hypocrites. This may be accounted one rea&s;on why ever politicks mixed with, or &s;upplanted religion. Men at fir&s;t, by de|ceit
<PB N="285" REF="293">of others, were led into double dealing, from a pretence of &s;erving the intere&s;ts of Godline&s;s, and thought it very innocent to u&s;e guile to catch men to their party. By this means they attacked the Devil with his own weapons, but not being &s;o dex|terous at it as him, he overcame them, and made them pro&s;elites to his own cau&s;e and intere&s;t.&mdash;And thus by accu&s;toming them&s;elves to hypocriti|cal refinements, it became con&s;titutional for them to be hypocrites. By this means it came to pa&s;s, that every &s;y&s;tem of reputable religion was found|ed in deceit, as being grounded in human policy, and regulated by the cunning of &s;uch as had &s;ome end to &s;erve with it.</P>
<P>HYPOCRISY by degrees was formed into a &s;y&s;|tem, and called by the name of needful policy; and though every party cried out again&s;t one ano|ther for deceit and religious refinement, yet they u&s;ed it in their turn for their own intere&s;t. It was becau&s;e men had not truth at heart, that each pre|vailing per&s;ua&s;ion guarded their &s;y&s;tem with canons, creeds, and confe&s;&s;ions of faith. Con&s;cious of their own bad intentions, they were jealous of all others; and becau&s;e they wanted charity, <HI>they thought evil.</HI> So far did this religious deceit prevail, that men who under&s;tood the advantage of human policy in the kingdoms of this world, began to model the kingdom of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> after the &s;ame fa&s;hion; and when men in power &s;aw meet to be religious, they formed a glorious, political, religious con&s;titution, and called it by the pompous name of, a NA|TIONAL CHURCH.</P>
<P>THIS political kingdom, which they called <HI>The Church of Chri&s;t,</HI> was, and is managed the &s;ame way as the kingdoms of this world, and places of di&s;tinction in it, are di&s;po&s;ed of, according to the in|tere&s;ts and plea&s;ure of &s;uch as pre&s;ide over its po|liticks. By this means men became at la&s;t hypo|crites
<PB N="286" REF="294">by law, and with a good grace could deceit|fully refine upon chri&s;tianity, becau&s;e they had the &s;cribes and phari&s;ees of the <HI>National Religion</HI> to keep them in countenance. If at any time &s;ome flying parties broke off from the body politic, be|cau&s;e they were not received into their deceitful councils, and &s;et up for them&s;elves, they carried along with them the &s;ame &s;pirit, and formed their <HI>New Monarchy</HI> as like the old one as po&s;&s;ibly they could; only for want of a king they called it a <HI>Re|publick,</HI> and cried out for liberty of con&s;cience.&mdash;But men would much mi&s;take their meaning, if they under&s;tood them as &s;peaking as they thought; for their liberty had no other &s;ignification, but as it re&s;pected them&s;elves; for to all others they were as ready to act the tyrant, as ever tho&s;e of whom they complained. And whenever they got their policy &s;ettled according to their mind, it was always ingrafted upon tyranny: For all the&s;e little re|ligious republics, had laws as oppo&s;ite to Chri&s;tian Liberty as the great Empire they had de&s;erted. All their rules of policy abridged the rights of pri|vate judgment, and they would give men to the Devil for u&s;ing it. When this deceit came to any great height, they &s;erved the laws of their party up the length of per&s;ecution; and if a man &s;aw meet to think for him&s;elf, they would &s;tile him an <HI>He|retick,</HI> and deliver him over to <HI>Satan</HI> in order to <HI>&s;ave his &s;oul.</HI></P>
<P>So &s;ubtile is this religious deceit, that it hath diffu&s;ed it&s;elf through all religious parties, &s;o that it is not &s;afe for any one man to tru&s;t another. He who will inform you of his religious experience, and his intercour&s;e with heaven, will al&s;o bla&s;t your character, and ruin your intere&s;t if he can. The&s;e &s;ame $ips that utter my&s;teries, and blab forth de|votion when their heart &s;ees meet to allow them, will al&s;o utter &s;landers, and devoutly play the devil.</P>
<PB N="287" REF="295">
<P>MICAH's advice is become mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, <HI>Tru&s;t not in a friend, put no confidence in a guide: for every friend will deceive, and every brother will &s;up|plant.</HI> Such a &s;trange &s;ubtilty there is in this in|iquity, that it kills when it &s;eems to plea&s;e; makes men commend with a de&s;ign to gain credit, that they may have it in their power to ruin you at their plea&s;ure. It works by flattery, in&s;inuation and guile; and tho&s;e who are be&s;t &s;killed in the arts of religious deceit, when they ki&s;s <HI>they &s;tab at the fifth rib.</HI> All their commendations of &s;uch as are not of their party, carry oblique &s;trokes of calumny in their bo&s;om. This evil principle directs them to expre&s;s pity and compa&s;&s;ion for others, when no|thing delights them more than their errors and mi&s;|fortunes. Such weavers of <HI>Spiders webs</HI> of hypo|cri&s;y, will bemoan your mi&s;ery to appearance, when nothing elates their pride higher than your unhap|pine&s;s. Moreover, &s;o &s;ubtile is this poi&s;on, that it will even make men pray for tho&s;e they bear no good-will to; and addre&s;s heaven for their happi|ne&s;s, when it is far from their heart to de&s;ire it. In a word, it hath di&s;&s;eminated it&s;elf through all the powers of the human under&s;tanding, and through all parties and &s;ocieties of men.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> LET US con&s;ider what may be the be&s;t antidote again&s;t religious deception and impo&s;ition. Pride certainly is the &s;pring of it, and humility and &s;elf-denial will be the be&s;t remedy. Let us then &s;tudy to be humble, and not to think of our&s;elves above what we are: He that is puft up <HI>falleth into the &s;nare of the Devil.</HI> It is pride and &s;elf-conceit which hath led men into all the&s;e religious decep|tions. To advance their name, their intere&s;t, or character in the world, men through pride have fre|quently u&s;ed very indirect and prepo&s;terous me|thods. When pride cannot make its way to pre|ferment
<PB N="288" REF="296">at fir&s;t in&s;tance honourably, it will endea|vour it by the hidden means of di&s;hone&s;ty and de|ceit. Nothing is more agreeable to mo&s;t men, in a country where religion is in repute, than to be e|minent in the outward parts of it. Pride loves to be &s;een of men: And when there are many others &s;tanding in their way to cloud their eminence, their pride di&s;po&s;eth them to remove them by po|licy and cunning. But the humble per&s;on has no rivals to di&s;tre&s;s him: At all times the <HI>te&s;timony of a good con&s;cience</HI> &s;atisfies him, and other men's emi|nence gives him plea&s;ure, but not pain. Being denied to the honours and plea&s;ures of this world, he is ea&s;y who &s;hare them among them, for he knows they are not fit for him. His chief care is over him&s;elf, and how to bear that cro&s;s his Savi|our hath commanded him to take up. The ju&s;t|ling of religious parties for honour and preferment gives him no unea&s;ine&s;s, becau&s;e his mind is aver&s;e to them, and he expects no preferment till <HI>the re|&s;urrection of the ju&s;t,</HI> when he &s;hall be <HI>openly acknow|ledged</HI> in the day of judgment, and completely re|ceive his due reward which his Lord hath promi&s;ed him. Humility makes men pa&s;s through life, with|out any de&s;ire to be &s;een of others; and when con|tending parties are &s;triving to rai&s;e their heads a|bove one another, the humble &s;oul retires from the bu&s;tle, and enjoys him&s;elf in retirement and medi|tation. Or if in Providence he be called to bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and to act a part for the publick weal, he en|deavours to do his bu&s;ine&s;s without oftentation, and &s;erves the publick without accounting him&s;elf important. The plaudite of publick applau&s;e doth not &s;tir up his vanity, nor doth their &s;lander oppre&s;s him. Unmoved with prai&s;e, he is humble; un|&s;haken with reproach, he is &s;teady and faithful. When the &s;ons of &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s and religious
<PB N="289" REF="297">deceit are &s;triving who &s;hall gain the highe&s;t ap|probation for religion and virtue from the publick, he retires peaceable with this reflection, <HI>I am le&s;s than the lea&s;t of all &s;aints.</HI> Humility has no opi|nion of publick applau&s;e, it neither values nor courts it, but looks down upon it, and de&s;pi&s;eth it. A humble per&s;on wants not indeed to procure any man's di&s;plea&s;ure by evil deeds, but would &s;trive to do good to all: But when he hath done all the good in his power, he craves no re&s;pect for it, nor makes any merit of it; he &s;till accounts him&s;elf <HI>but an unprofitable &s;ervant, having only done what was his duty to do.</HI></P>
<P>HUMILITY pre&s;erves men both from the heights of enthu&s;ia&s;m, and the unwarrantable paths of &s;uper&s;tition. The humble per&s;on wants not to be thought the favourite of the Deity, but to be &s;o; and has no intention to tru&s;t to <HI>beggarly elements,</HI> but &s;eeks after <HI>pure and undefiled religion.</HI> His <HI>zeal is according to knowledge,</HI> and moderate by di&s;cre|tion; and his devotion con&s;i&s;ts of the exerci&s;e of the heart, and not in the pageantry of ceremonies, and the dregs of will-wor&s;hip. Let us &s;trive to be humble, and we &s;hall never be deceitful: If once we have our pride in &s;ubjection, we &s;hall not be anxious what be the opinon of the world concern|ing us. Let us be denied to all the glories and honours of this deceitful world, and none of the&s;e deceits which ruin the &s;ouls and bodies of men &s;hall ever hurt us. Let &s;uch whom it may con|cern, &s;et up to be the directors and leaders in the National Religion in any country, or the ma&s;ters of the ceremonies of this or the other petty So|ciety: Let us &s;ubmit-to Providence, and &s;erve God <HI>in truth and &s;incerity.</HI> Let us keep by the primitive example of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and his Apo&s;tles, and <HI>in all meekne&s;s and humility have our conver&s;ation in
<PB N="290" REF="298">the world.</HI> Let all the various &s;ocieties of religi|ous devotees to hypocri&s;y, &s;eek their own impor|tance, and <HI>weave a Spider's web</HI> of deceit as long as they will: <HI>Let us deny our&s;elves, and take up our cro&s;s daily, and follow Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> Let us &s;ay &s;in|cerely, <HI>Surely in the Lord alone have we righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;trength.</HI></P>
