<HEAD>AN Impartial HISTORY Of the REIGN of King <HI>GEORGE.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>_IT would be a Satyr upon the Reign of the King, to &s;ugge&s;t that it would not bear an Im|partial Hi&s;tory; and it would be much more a Satyr upon tho&s;e who read the&s;e Sheets, to &s;ay they &s;hould di&s;like them for their being Impartial.</P>
<P>As if it was impo&s;&s;ible to write as an Hi&s;torian, without mingling with the relations of Fact, the Reflections, the Reproaches, and the Excur&s;ions
<PB N="2" REF="3">
of the Pa&s;&s;ions of Men, who on one Side or other, have carried Faction and Party-Quarrel to &s;uch an extravagant height in this Reign.</P>
<P>If I meet with the&s;e unhappy Things in my way, as who can trace the Actions of contend|ing Parties, without jo&s;tling &s;ometimes with their Failings and Follies, I &s;hall endeavour to repre|&s;ent them in the mo&s;t favourable manner on either &s;ide, and make no Reflections upon them, except in &s;uch Ca&s;es wherein they &s;hall acknowledge tho&s;e Reflections to be natural and ju&s;t.</P>
<P>I cannot promi&s;e to oblige tho&s;e Readers who had rather be deceived than inform'd, who can|not read with Plea&s;ure, except they find their Author as warm in Hi&s;tory as they are in their Di&s;cour&s;e, and unle&s;s one Party is cru&s;h'd, and the other e&s;pou&s;ed: Such Gentlemen would do well to take up with tho&s;e who write after that manner: And I doubt not but each Side may find Authors to plea&s;e them, e&s;pecially as Times now go.</P>
<P>As for this Work, its Title is an <HI>Impartial Hi|&s;tory,</HI> and &s;uch they &s;hall find it: The King &s;hall have all that Ju&s;tice and Regard which Duty commands, as well to his Maje&s;ty's Per&s;on and Intere&s;t as to the ju&s;t Merit of his Admini&s;tration: His Servants and Friends &s;hall be &s;poken of with Honour, with Truth, and with good Manners; and yet all &s;hall be unmix'd with &s;urfeiting Panegy|rick, and the unmanly Flattery which truly glorious Princes abhor to receive, and Men of &s;en&s;e to give.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="4">
I &s;hall have no Re&s;erve here in Favour of any Party, if any Expre&s;&s;ion &s;hall be &s;ubject to a <HI>double Con&s;truction,</HI> and Party-Malice &s;hall guide the un|charitable Thoughts of any to take <HI>the wor&s;t:</HI> Be the Shame to them&s;elves, who mean evil, and &s;u&s;pect others. I &s;hall, as much as po&s;&s;ible, avoid giving &s;uch any Advantage, or laying my &s;elf o|pen to their Gen&s;ure.</P>
<P>The Work is a Hi&s;tory, not a Satyr; Relation of Fact is the Bu&s;ine&s;s, not Rallery at Parties or Per&s;ons. If any Gentlemen have fallen under the Weight of Publick Ju&s;tice, it is enough that I give an Account how they came to the Di&s;a&s;ter, and what End their Mi&s;carriages have brought them to; without following their Me|mories with Reproaches beyond the Grave, or De&s;canting in Tryumph over their Mi&s;eries.</P>
<P>Men of Misfortune &s;hould be treated with Decency, let their Crime be what it will; 'tis enough to Record the Mi&s;take they fall under, and leave them at the Place of Execution, where the Law has left them.</P>
<P>And all this I hope may be without taking Part with any Body. As to the <HI>Pretender,</HI> I &s;hall &s;peak of him as he ought to be &s;poken of, without entring into any Di&s;putes about him: In which I &s;hall no more favour his Intere&s;t, than a <HI>Painter</HI> may be &s;aid to take part with an Enemy, when he de&s;cribes a Battle, becau&s;e he does not Picture the routed Side in the Shape of Devils and Mon &s;ters.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5">
Rebellion &s;hall be treated with Ju&s;tice, and yet even the Rebels not be in&s;ulted; their Follies, their Temerity, and the inexpre&s;&s;ible Error of their Conduct, &s;hall not be hid in Favour of them, or ex|patiated in Triumph. I &s;hall even venture to pity their Misfortunes, and yet not fear being &s;o much as &s;u&s;pected of favouring their De&s;igns.</P>
<P>The Clemency of the Government &s;hall not be le&s;&s;en'd by Reflections upon its being too late, or advanc'd beyond it &s;elf for being too &s;oon; Nor &s;hall I hide the Mi&s;takes of tho&s;e, to who&s;e Folly their own Friends acknowledge they owe its com|ing no &s;ooner.</P>
<P>In a Word, and to &s;horten all Preambles, Friend and Enemy &s;hall, with the utmo&s;t Impar|tiality, have Ju&s;tice done them in this Hi&s;tory, and as little Offence be given to any Side as po&s;&s;ible.</P>

<HEAD>AN Impartial HISTORY.</HEAD>
<P>QUEEN <HI>Ann</HI> of truly <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Memory, Dy'd the 1&s;t of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1714, about 8 a Clock in the Morning. The Council had been a&s;&s;embled in an Extraordinary Manner for 2 or 3 Days before, upon Intimation from the Duke of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> Lord High-Trea&s;urer, that there was no room left to expect Her Maje&s;ty's Life, and the Phy&s;itians go|ing and returning continually between the Coun|cil Chamber, and the Queen's Bed-Chamber, to give an Account how Things were.</P>
<P>During this mournful Interval, as it may very ju&s;tly be call'd, the Queen being as it were nei|ther dead or living, but drawing her la&s;t Breath, the Doors of the Council Chamber were &s;et open, and many of the Nobility that appear'd, at lea&s;t of tho&s;e who bore the Character of Privy-Coun|cellors, though not &s;ummon'd in the Ordinary Way, were admitted; there being no more now before them, but to &s;it &s;till, and expect when the News &s;hould be brought, That the Queen was expir'd, and then to act as the Con&s;titution directed.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7">
It mu&s;t not be omitted here, this being the proper Place for it, That among all the Nobili|ty that appear'd on this Occa&s;ion at Court, as well tho&s;e in the Admini&s;tration, and neare&s;t to the Queen, as others; there was not the lea&s;t He&s;itation in, or &s;o much as an Enquiry about what was before them; I mean as to the Succe&s;&s;i|on of the Crown: The Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover</HI> was &s;o natural to the E&s;tabli&s;hment made in Parliament, that no Man &s;o much as ask'd the Que&s;tion, Who was next Heir? or, Who ought to &s;ucceed? But the Eyes of the Nation, as one Man, turn'd all the &s;ame Way; and if any &s;ecret Wi&s;hes were en|tertain'd, there was not the lea&s;t room to bring them out, no not &s;o much as in Words.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Word was brought to the Council, that the Queen was dead, the Lords broke up, and adjourn'd to the Cockpit, where there was quickly a General Appearance of all the Nobili|ty, and Per&s;ons of Rank that were in Town, as is u&s;ual on &s;uch Occa&s;ions; and where it was una|nimou&s;ly agreed, That the Elector of <HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> Duke of <HI>Hanover,</HI> was the only True Lawful and Rightful Succe&s;&s;or to the Crown: What De&s;igns there were to de&s;troy that Settlement, or who were guilty of &s;uch De&s;igns, if any were, &s;eems rather the Subject of future Hi&s;tory, than of Political Reflections before-hand: As far as &s;uch De&s;igns are judicially prov'd, &s;o far it will be the Bu&s;ine&s;s of an Hi&s;torian to record them; and what ap|pears of that kind, &s;hall be &s;tated with the &s;ame Impartiallity that we Profe&s;s in the whole Series of this Work. A Proclamation being order'd to be immediately prepar'd, and the Heralds attend|ing, the King was accordingly proclaim'd at <HI>White-Hall-Gate,</HI> with all the u&s;ual Ceremonies;
<PB N="7" REF="8">
and all the Nobility and Gentry pre&s;ent, having fir&s;t &s;ign'd the Proclamation, went in their Coaches to attend the Proclaiming His Maje&s;ty in the Ci|ty, at the u&s;ual Places, and la&s;t of all, at the <HI>Royal-Exchange;</HI> and thus the Day which begun in Sorrow, ended with Joy, and the People gave all po&s;&s;ible Demon&s;trations of their Satisfaction, in Bonfires, Illuminations, and the u&s;ual Extrava|gancies of &s;uch Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>While the&s;e Things were doing, Expre&s;&s;es were di&s;patch'd in the Heels of one another to <HI>Hanover, as well Fir&s;t,</HI> To give His Maje&s;ty, then Elector of <HI>Hanover,</HI> notice of the Queen's Condition, and that there was no Probability that Her Maje&s;ty could recover; as al&s;o to intimate in what good Di&s;po&s;itions every thing &s;tood in Relation to His Electoral Highne&s;s's Succe&s;&s;ion, and that there was no room to doubt its being effectually &s;ecur'd; <HI>as afterwards</HI> to let His Maje&s;ty know, That the Queen was dead, and how not only peaceably, and without the lea&s;t Reluctance, much le&s;s Di|&s;turbance; but with an Univer&s;al Appearance of Joy, and Satisfaction, His Maje&s;ty's Acce&s;&s;ion had been receiv'd, and His Title Proclaim'd, in|viting His Maje&s;ty with the greate&s;t Expre&s;&s;ions of Duty and Affection, to come over with what &s;peed his Affairs would admit, to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Crown.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Dor&s;et</HI> was the Per&s;on &s;ent over by the Council with this la&s;t Me&s;&s;age, and the Baron <HI>Bothmar</HI> had &s;ignify'd the fir&s;t Part by his Secre|tary, with whom, or immediately before, went another Per&s;on of Quality, Mr. <HI>Craggs,</HI> &s;ince made Secretary of State, &s;ent over by the particular Friends of His Electoral Highne&s;s, and &s;ince ad|vanc'd to &s;everal Po&s;ts of Tru&s;t in the Government.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="9">
In order to make this Hi&s;tory be a compleat Record of Fact, it is needful to &s;et down more fully than ordinary, the fir&s;t Steps of the King's Acce&s;&s;ion, that remarkable Tran&s;action being &s;uch, as is not likely to occur again in many Ages, and perhaps never.</P>
<P>The Act of Settlement of the Succe&s;&s;ion, in which tho&s;e Things were &s;pecifically expre&s;&s;ed, and by which the Mea&s;ures of Conduct on both Sides were pre&s;crib'd, had directed the E&s;tabli&s;h|ment of a Regency, which upon the Demi&s;e of the la&s;t Heir in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;hould take Place, and &s;hould be empower'd to act in the Name of the Succe&s;&s;or, till the &s;aid Succe&s;&s;or &s;hould ar|rive, which Regency were to con&s;i&s;t of &s;even of the chief Officers of the Crown, for the Time be|ing, and &s;uch other Per&s;ons, as by an In&s;trument under the Hand and Seal of the Succe&s;&s;or, &s;hould by Virtue of that Act be nominated and appoint|ed; the &s;aid In&s;trument to be &s;eal'd up in three &s;everal Parts, one Part to be committed to the Cu&s;tody of &s;uch Per&s;ons as the &s;aid Act directs, not to be open'd till the Succe&s;&s;ion was to take Place; but lea&s;t this Account &s;hould not fully de&s;cribe this, becau&s;e of the Con&s;titution, and the Proceedings, I refer to the Words of the Sta|tute, which are ea&s;ily to be found.</P>
<P>Pur&s;uant to this Act, an In&s;trument in Form was &s;ign'd, in three Parts, by the Elector of <HI>Han|over,</HI> and was committed to the keeping of the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> the Lord Chancellor, and Mon&s;ieur <HI>Kreyenberg,</HI> then Re&s;ident here from the Elector; and the&s;e Per&s;ons &s;everally produ|cing the &s;ame in Council, the &s;aid Council being met at St. <HI>James</HI>'s; as &s;oon as the Queen's Death
<PB N="9" REF="10">
was known, the Regency was immediately known al&s;o, and took Place accordingly.</P>
<P>But it mu&s;t be noted, That after the &s;aid In&s;tru|ments were read and receiv'd, and yet before the Lords Commi&s;&s;ion'd thereby, and by the Act of Settlement began to Act, the Lords of the Coun|cil having invited, as is u&s;ual in &s;uch Ca&s;es, all the Nobility, Per&s;ons of Quality, the Lord-Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> and Principal Citizens to joyn with them, proceeded to proclaim the King; and this not only by Form of a Proclamation, but by the reading the &s;aid Proclamation with Sound of Trumpet, at the Gate of the Palace; and &s;o on in all the u&s;ual Places of the City: All the &s;aid Nobility and Per&s;ons of Note attending in Ca|valcade, as u&s;ual; which al&s;o was attended with the u&s;ual Acclamations of the People, and fol|low'd by the like Publick Proclaiming the King all over the Kingdom.</P>
<P>The Proclamation with the Names annex'd to it, is as follows,</P>
<P>WHEREAS <HI>it hath plea&s;ed Almighty God to call to his Mercy, our late Sovereign Lady Queen</HI> Ann, <HI>of Ble&s;&s;ed Memory, by who&s;e Decea&s;e the Imperial Crowns of</HI> Great Britain, France <HI>and</HI> Ire|land, <HI>are &s;olely, and rightfully come to the High and Mighty Prince,</HI> GEORGE, <HI>Elector of</HI> Brun&s;wick-Lunenburg: <HI>We therefore the Lords Spiritual and Temporal of the Realm, being here a&s;&s;i&s;ted with the&s;e of Her late Maje&s;ty's Privy Council, with Numbers of other Principal Gentlemen of Quality, with the</HI> Lord-Mayor, Aldermen, <HI>and Citizens of</HI> London; <HI>do now hereby, with en full Voice, and Con&s;ent of Tangue, and Heart, Publi&s;h and Proclaim, That the High and Mighty Prince,</HI> GEORGE, <HI>Elector of</HI> Brun&s;wick-Lunenburg,
<PB N="10" REF="11">
<HI>is now by the Death of our late Sovereign of Happy Memory, become our only Lawful and Right|ful Liege Lord.</HI> GEORGE, <HI>By the Grace of God, King of</HI> Great Britain, France <HI>and</HI> Ireland, <HI>Defen|der of the Faith,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>To whom we do acknowledge all Faith, and con&s;tant Obedience, with all hearty and humble Affection; be&s;eeching God, by whom Kings and Queens reign, te ble&s;s the Royal King</HI> GEORGE, <HI>with long and happy Years to Reign over us.</HI></P>
<P>Given at the Palace of St. <HI>James</HI>'s, the fir&s;t Day of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1714</P>

<P>From, and immediately upon this, the Lords Ju&s;tices, or Lords of the Regency, began to act; and the fir&s;t Matter of Note, proper to the pre|&s;ent purpo&s;e, which came before them, was to di&s;patch their Orders into <HI>Scotland</HI> to have the like Proclamation publi&s;hed there, according to the U&s;age of the Kingdom; which was perform'd accordingly, by the Orders of the Earl of <HI>I&s;la,</HI> then Lord Ju&s;tice General of <HI>Scotland;</HI> the Duke of <HI>Montro&s;s,</HI> one of the Lords of the Regency, be|ing pre&s;ent, and at the Head of the proce&s;&s;ion. This was the 4th of <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The Proclamation there, I omit for want of room here, as al&s;o not being &s;o ab&s;olutely need|ful, it being the &s;ame, <HI>Mutatis Mutandis,</HI> as the above Proclamation for <HI>England;</HI> to which I refer.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Mea&s;ures were taken for Proclaming the King in <HI>Ireland:</HI> And &s;uch &s;peed the Me&s;&s;en|gers made, and &s;o good a Pa&s;&s;age they had, that the Orders of the Lords of the Regency arrived at <HI>Dublin</HI> the 6th, and the King was immediately Proclaimed there, with all the u&s;ual Solemnity, and with the &s;ame Proclamation <HI>Mutatis Mutandis</HI> as above.</P>
<P>Due Mea&s;ures having thus been taken for Pro|claiming the King in all Parts of his Dominini|ons, the Lords of the Regency proceeded in the nece&s;&s;ary Admini&s;tration of the executive Power;
<PB N="13" REF="14">
and fir&s;t they di&s;patch'd the proper Military Offi|cers to their re&s;pective Po&s;ts, in all Parts of the Kingdom, in order to pre&s;erve the Peace, and to be ready upon every Exigence for the Defence of the Places they had in Charge. The Garri&s;ons upon the Coa&s;t were al&s;o order'd to be reinforced by Detachments of Troops, particularly that of <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> and <HI>Sherene&s;s,</HI> as the Two Keys of the Royal Navy; And Ve&s;&s;els were order'd, one to View the Sea Ports of <HI>France,</HI> to &s;ee if any Arma|ment was in hand there, or any Preparations at which Umbrage might be taken; but they report|ed, That all was quiet there, and no appearance of any Preparations of any kind.</P>
<P>The&s;e Orders being i&s;&s;ued, they cho&s;e Mr. <HI>Ad|di&s;on, the &s;ame who has &s;ince been made Secretary of State,</HI> to be Secretary of the Regency, and order|ed all the Di&s;patches directed to the Secretaries of State to be &s;ent to him, &s;uperceding thereby the Offices of the Lord <HI>Bolingbroke</HI> and Mr. <HI>Bromley,</HI> who were Secretaries of State at the time of the Queen's Decea&s;e, and continued in the Office of Secretary by Vertue of the Act of Parliament for Six Months.</P>
<P>On the 5th they I&s;&s;ued a Proclamation for Con|tinuing all Per&s;ons in their Employments and Of|fices, till his Maje&s;ty's Plea&s;ure &s;hould be farther known, appointing them to take the Oaths re|quir'd by Act of Parliament, and to perform &s;uch other Things as the Law requir'd them to per|form, to qualifie them for keeping their &s;aid Po&s;ts re&s;pectively.</P>
<P>And that we may take all things with us as we go, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erv'd, That pur&s;uant to the Act of Settlement, which appoints that the Parlia|ment in Being, at the Demi&s;e of the Prince, &s;hall

It took them up &s;ome time to requallifie their Members; du|ring which Interval, the Speaker, Mr.&mdash;, be|ing then ab&s;ent in the Country, had Notice &s;ent him by Expre&s;s, and came up Po&s;t to the Hou&s;e, where he appear'd the 4th; &s;o the Hou&s;e being con&s;tituted, the Lords of the Regency went in a Body the next day to the Upper-Hou&s;e, and the Commons being &s;ent for, the Lord Chancellor made, or rather read, the following Speech to both Hou&s;es: I &s;ay Read, becau&s;e the Contents were perus'd, approv'd, and the Expre&s;&s;ions limi|ted, in the Council of the Regency, before they went up. The Speech is as follows,</P>
<P><Q>My Lords and Gentlemen,</Q></P>
<P><HI>IT is with great Satisfaction we can now tell you, That we have this Morning received a Letter from the King, wherein his Majesty is graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to acquaint us, That his Maje&s;ty is ha&s;tening hither to employ his utmo&s;t Care for putting the&s;e Kiagdoms into a happy and flouri&s;hing Condition.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He has commanded us in the mean time, to continue our Care of every thing that may conduce to the Peace and Safety of his Dominions: And we are a&s;&s;ured, That if this had required his more immediate Pre&s;ence, he would without delay have repaired hither for the Sup|port of &s;o Dutiful and Faithful Subjects: For his Maje&s;ty does very particularly expre&s;s his great Satis|faction in the Loyalty and Affection which his People have univer&s;ally &s;hewn upon his Maje&s;ty's Acce&s;&s;ion to the Crown</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="16">
<HI>At the opening this Se&s;&s;ion, we did not mention to you the Apprehen&s;ions we then had from the Smallne&s;s of the Sum at that time advanced, that the Lottery would not be full, being de&s;irous in the fir&s;t place to try to make it effectual in the manner the Parliament had e&s;tabli&s;hed it; but we are obliged now to acquaint you, That all our Endeavours have failed of the de&s;ired Succe&s;s, tho' the Contributions have been thereby con&s;ide|rably increa&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>We mu&s;t therefore earne&s;tly recommend to you,</HI> Gen|tlemen of the Hou&s;e of Commons, <HI>to take this into your Con&s;ideration, and to give &s;uch further Encourage|ment as you &s;hall think proper for rai&s;ing the whole Sum which was intended, and is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for car|rying on the Service of the Year.</HI></P>
<P>The Loyal Proceedings of this Parliament, their readine&s;s in Concurring with every Propo&s;al made to them for the Publick Good, the Unanimity in which they acted in every thing for the King's In|tere&s;t, was &s;uch, as that tho' few Writers have done Ju&s;tice to them, yet the mo&s;t prejudiced have not been able to fa&s;ten the lea&s;t Omi&s;&s;ion or Commi&s;|&s;ion upon them, or upon their Behaviour, or &s;o much as told us why they have been &s;o unwilling to do them that Ju&s;tice which &s;o needful and &s;ea|&s;onable an adherence to the King's Intere&s;t re|quir'd.</P>
<P>I have nothing to do to enquire here whether or no the Complaint was ju&s;t, which &s;ome have made of this Parliament's being treated with di&s;re&s;pect; or that the Returns made them were not &s;uitable to the Zeal and Alacrity which they &s;hew'd for his Maje&s;ty's Intere&s;t; it is enough to re|cord their Dutiful and Affectionate Behaviour to the King's Intere&s;t, and to that of his
<PB N="16" REF="17">
Succe&s;&s;ion; and let other Enquire concerning the Returns which were made them.</P>
<P>Certainly whoever &s;hall Read the Proceedings of the &s;hort Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament in which they acted, will own that they omitted nothing on their Part, to te&s;tify their Duty and Affection to King <HI>George,</HI> or for &s;ecuring his Intere&s;t and the Publick Peace in every part: And becau&s;e this Point has been &s;o little dwelt upon, it may be needful, and Ju&s;tice &s;eems to require it, that I &s;hould be as particular in this Ca&s;e as the Brevity of this work will admit.</P>
<P>Upon the Return of the Commons to their Hou&s;e, and taking a Speech into Con&s;ideration, they immediately re&s;olved <HI>Nemine Contradicente</HI> that an humble Addre&s;s &s;hould be pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty, to Condole and Congratulate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And the Lords at the &s;ame Time re&s;olv'd upon ano|ther: Both which Addre&s;&s;es were pre&s;ented to the Lords of the Regency, and were by them tran&s;mitted to the King.

<P>The&s;e Matters of Ceremony being over, the <HI>Commons</HI> fell immediately to taking into Con&s;ide|ration the Speech of the <HI>Lord Chancellor</HI> in the Name of the <HI>Regency,</HI> and came to &s;everal vigorous Re&s;o|lutions for the publick Service, particularly, they immediately Voted the Bill of Supply for the Sup|port of His Maje&s;ty's Hou&s;hold, and the Honour and Dignity of the Crown, that is, in a few Words, the <HI>Civil Li&s;t Bill.</HI> This was perticularly ordered to be the &s;ame that the Queen Enjoy'd, that is to &s;ay, 700000 <HI>l. per Annum,</HI> and to begin from the Death of the Queen, only with Exception to the Revenues of the Dutchy of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> which are ve&s;ted by Law in the Per&s;on of the Prince, as Duke of <HI>Cornwall.</HI></P>
<P>This Bill met with &s;uch a hearty Concurrence in the Hou&s;e, and was &s;o unanimou&s;ly carry'd on, that tho' it was the 7th of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> when it was

fir&s;t mov'd, it was fini&s;h'd, pa&s;s'd through both Hou&s;es, and receiv'd the Royal A&s;&s;ent the 14th.</P>
<P>But before I give an Account of that, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that on the 13th Mr. <HI>Craggs, Jun.</HI> the &s;ame who, at the time of the writing this Hi|&s;tory, is one of the Secretarys of State, and who had been di&s;patch'd by &s;ome Per&s;ons, as above, the Evening before the Queen's Death, to give the King an account of Things, return'd from <HI>Hano|ver,</HI> and brought the King's Letter to the Lords of the <HI>Regency;</HI> upon which, the &s;aid Regents came the &s;ame Day to the Hou&s;e, and the <HI>Lord Chancellor,</HI> in their Names, as before, made the following Speech to both Hou&s;es.</P>
<Q><P>My Lords, and Gentlemen,</P>
<P><HI>IT hath plea&s;ed Almighty God, to take to him&s;elf our late mo&s;t gracious Queen, of Ble&s;&s;ed Memory, we hope that nothing has been omitted which might contribute to the Safety of the&s;e Realms, and the Pre&s;ervation of our Religion, Laws, and Liberties, in this great Con|juncture. As the&s;e invaluable Ble&s;&s;ings have been &s;e|cured to us by tho&s;e Acts of Parliament which have &s;ettled the Succe&s;&s;ion of the&s;e Kingdoms in the mo&s;t Illu&s;trious Hou&s;e of</HI> Hanover, <HI>we have regulated our Proceedings from tho&s;e Rules which are therein pre&s;crib'd.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Privy-Council, &s;oon after the Demi&s;e of the late Queen, A&s;&s;embled at</HI> St. James<HI>'s, where according to the &s;aid Acts, the three In&s;truments were produc'd and open'd, which had been depo&s;ited in the Hands of the Arch-Bi&s;hop of</HI> Canterbury, <HI>the</HI> Lord Chancellor, <HI>and the Re&s;ident of</HI> Brun&s;wick. <HI>Tho&s;e who either by their Office, or by Virtue of the&s;e In&s;truments, had the Honour of being appointed Lords Ju&s;tices, did in Conjunction with the Council, immediately proceed to the Proclaim|ing</HI>

<HI>of our Lawful, and Rightful Sovereign King</HI> GEORGE, <HI>taking at the &s;ame time, the nece&s;&s;ary Care to maintain the publick Peace.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In pur&s;uance of the Acts, before-mention'd, this Parliament is now a&s;&s;embled, and we are per&s;waded you all bring with you &s;o hearty a Di&s;po&s;ition for His Maje&s;ty's Service, and the public-Good, that we can|not doubt of your A&s;&s;i&s;tance in every thing which may promote tho&s;e great Ends.</HI></P></Q>
<Q><P>Gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Commons,</P>
<P><HI>We find it nece&s;&s;ary to put you in mind that &s;everal Branches of the publick Revenue are expired, by the De|mi&s;e of Her late Maje&s;ty, and to recommend to you the making &s;uch provi&s;ions in that Re&s;pect, as may be requi&s;ite to &s;upport the Honour and Dignity of the Crown. And we a&s;&s;ure our &s;elves, you will not be wanting in any thing that may conduce to the e&s;tabli&s;hing, and advanc|ing of the publick Credit.</HI></P></Q>
<Q><P>My Lords, and Gentlemen,</P>
<P><HI>We forbear laying before you any Thing that does not require your immediate Con&s;ideration, not having re|ceiv'd His Maje&s;ty's Plea&s;ure. We &s;hall only exhort you, with the greate&s;t Earne&s;tne&s;s, to a perfect Una|nimity, and a firm Adherance to our Sovereign's In|tere&s;t, as being the only Means to continue among us our pre&s;ent happy Tranquillity.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Upon this Speech, the Hou&s;es &s;everally Voted Addre&s;&s;es of Thanks, and A&s;&s;urances of Loyalty; the Vote of the <HI>Hou&s;e of Commons</HI> run thus, to re|turn the Humble Thanks of the Hou&s;e to His Ma|je&s;ty, for the Satisfaction his Maje&s;ty has been pleas'd to expre&s;s in the Humble Duty and Affecti|on which His Loyal <HI>Commons</HI> have unanimou&s;ly

&s;hewn upon His happy Acce&s;&s;ion to the Throne; and for His gracious A&s;&s;urances of His Royal In|tentions, to make His People &s;peedily happy by his Pre&s;ence; a&s;&s;uring His Maje&s;ty of the continu|ance, of their Zeal for His Service, and Affection to his Per&s;on and Government, upon all Occa&s;i|ons; and that they would contribute their utmo&s;t Endeavours for pre&s;erving the publick Tranquili|ty, until His Maje&s;ty &s;hall arrive.</P>
<P>This Addre&s;s was al&s;o order'd to be pre&s;ented to the Regents, in order to be tran&s;mitted to His Maje&s;ty. The Lord's Addre&s;s was al&s;o to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e Matters of Ceremony being di&s;patch'd, the Hou&s;e proceeded to take into Con&s;ideration the Lottery Bill, this Lottery it &s;eems, being laid in the Mini&s;try of the late Lord Trea&s;urer, the Earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> at a Currant Intere&s;t but of 4 <HI>per Cent.</HI> and the able Hand that undertook it at that Rate, and would no Que&s;tion have carry'd it through, as he had done other things more difficult by far than that, being withdrawn, and di&s;plac'd; the Job|bers and mony'd Men in the City blow'd upon it; and notwith&s;tanding, the Court and all its Dependencies, on that critical Occa&s;ion, for|warded the Sub&s;cription in a publick Manner, going down in a Body to the City to Sub&s;cribe, by which Means a very great Sum of Money was Sub&s;crib'd; yet there being &s;till &s;everal hundred thou&s;and Pounds wanting, the Lords of the <HI>Re|gency</HI> found it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to lay it before the Hou&s;e, who immediately pa&s;s'd an Act to rai&s;e the Intere&s;t from 4 to 5 <HI>per Cent.</HI> upon the Sub&s;cription: And this gave Life to the Bu&s;ine&s;s, and the Money was &s;ub&s;crib'd in a few Hours, with the greate&s;t Allacrity po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="24">
Both the&s;e Bills, <HI>viz.</HI> That of the <HI>Civil Li&s;t,</HI> and this of adding 1 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Intere&s;t to the <HI>Lot|tery,</HI> together with a Bill for rectifying &s;ome Mi&s;takes in the Names of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the <HI>Land-Tax,</HI> were all pa&s;s'd and ready for the Royal A&s;&s;ent by the 17th, which, as was even then ob&s;erv'd, was &s;uch a Te&s;timony of the Zeal. Chearfulne&s;s and Steadine&s;s of that Parliament in the Service and Intere&s;t of the King, as de|&s;erves to be recorded to Po&s;terity, together with the open Te&s;timony which the King him&s;elf gave to their Loyalty and Affection in all his Maje&s;ty's Letters and An&s;wers, and on all Occa&s;ions where|in he thought fit to make mention of them. How it came to pa&s;s afterwards, that &s;ome People en|deavour'd to repre&s;ent this very <HI>Hou&s;e of Commons</HI> as dangerous and di&s;affected, and to le&s;&s;en the Re|putation of their Conduct, I know not, or at lea&s;t care not to enquire; nor is this &s;aid, to lead the Reader to any Reflections upon the &s;udden Di&s;&s;olu|tion of the Hou&s;e afterwards, even without giving them the Honour of &s;eeing the King's Face among them, for who&s;e Intere&s;t they had &s;o heartily em|bark'd: all tho&s;e things I leave as they come to Hand, for every one to judge of as they think &s;it.</P>
<P>However the <HI>Commons</HI> have not left them&s;elves without a Te&s;timony of their own Behaviour, in that eminent Speech which the Speaker made at the Bar of the <HI>Hou&s;e of Lords,</HI> when he pre&s;ented the Bills abovenam'd, to the Lords <HI>the Regents,</HI> for the Royal A&s;&s;ent; in which the Speaker boldly a&s;&s;erts, the Zeal and Fidelity of the <HI>Hou&s;e of Commons;</HI> and is not afraid, even to make &s;ome Pretences to it, from the Pledge or Earne&s;t which he brought then to his Maje&s;ty, as well of what was pa&s;t, as of
<PB N="24" REF="25">
their Re&s;olution to continue it, and to recom|mend it to his Maje&s;ty for his Acceptance. But I refer to the Speech it &s;elf, as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<Q><P>My Lords,</P>
<P><HI>THE Knights, Citizens and Burge&s;&s;es of</HI> Great Britain, <HI>in Parliament a&s;&s;embled, under the pre&s;ent Happine&s;s they enjoy by His Maje&s;ty's peaceable and quiet Acce&s;&s;ion to the Throne, could not enter upon any Work more &s;atisfactory and plea&s;ing to them&s;elves, than the providing a &s;ufficient Revenue for the Occa&s;i|ons of His Maje&s;ty's Civil Government, in order to make His Reign as ea&s;ie and pro&s;perous, as the Begin|ning of it hath been &s;ecure and undi&s;turb'd.</HI></P>
<P><HI>They are &s;en&s;ible, that the Peace of the Kingdom is not to be pre&s;erv'd, nor the Rights and Liberties of the Subjects to be protected, without &s;upporting the ju&s;t Au|thority and Dignity of the Crown; and therefore they have thought it their Intere&s;t, as well as Duty, to make &s;uch a Provi&s;ion as may not barely &s;uffice to the Nece&s;&s;ity of the Government, but may be &s;uitable to the State, the Honour, and the Lu&s;ter which the Crown of</HI> Great Britain <HI>ought to be attended with.</HI></P>
<P><HI>What&s;oever is &s;uperfluous in that Provi&s;ion, and more than the ordinary Services of His Maje&s;ty &s;hall require, will but enable Him to exert His highe&s;t and mo&s;t va|luable Prerogative of doing Good; And we can give no greater Proof of the Tru&s;t we repo&s;e in His Maje&s;ty's gracious Di&s;po&s;ition, than putting the &s;ame entire Revenue into His Hands, which Her late Maje&s;ty died po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of; who&s;e Virtues we all admir'd, and of who&s;e Affection and Concern for the Religion, Laws, and Liberties of this Kingdom, we had had &s;o long Experi|ence.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="26">
<HI>As the Crown it &s;elf de&s;cends immediately, and knows no Vacancy, the</HI> Commons <HI>have taken Care, that the Revenue &s;hould follow it as clo&s;e as po&s;&s;ible; for they have given all the Di&s;patch to this Grant which the Forms of their Proceedings would allow; So that when His Maje&s;ty &s;hall plea&s;e to an&s;wer the Impatient De&s;ires of His People, by coming to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of His Kingdoms, he will find Him&s;elf equally e&s;tabli&s;h'd in the&s;e Revenues, as if he had &s;ucceeded to all by an uninterrupted Right of Inheritance: The only Difference is this, That if he had inherited them, he would have wanted one &s;ingle Proof of the Duty, and Affection, and Unanimity of His Subjects.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Our de&s;ire is, That this may be look'd upon as an Earne&s;t and a Pledge of that Zeal and Fidelity which we &s;hall always retain, and which, upon every Occa|&s;ion, we &s;hall be ready to demon&s;trate to His Maje&s;ty's Per&s;on and Government: As &s;uch, we hope His Maje|&s;ty will graciou&s;ly accept it at this Time; and here|after, when He &s;hall have had Experience of this fir&s;t voluntary Offering of His Loyal</HI> Commons, <HI>we hope He will find it to His Satisfaction, as large and as ample as He could wi&s;h; might but the Term of the Grant be as long as we could wi&s;h; &s;ince it is to have equal Con|tinuance with His Maje&s;ty's Life.</HI></P></Q>
<Q><P>My Lords,</P>
<P><HI>The Bill which the</HI> Commons <HI>have pa&s;s'd for the Purpo&s;es I have mention'd, is intituled,</HI> An Act for the better Support of His Maje&s;ty's Hou&s;hold, and of the Honour and Dignity of the Crown of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P><HI>They have al&s;o prepar'd another Bill, as well</HI> for rectifying Mi&s;takes in the Names of the Commi&s;|&s;ioners for the Land-Tax, as for rai&s;ing &s;o much as is wanting to make up the Sum of Fourteen
<PB N="26" REF="27">
Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds, intended to be rai&s;ed by a Lottery, for the publick Service in the Year 1724. <HI>This having been recommended to their Care, and appearing to them to be nece&s;&s;ary for His Maje&s;ty's and the</HI> publick Service, <HI>they have Rea&s;on to think they have now abundantly &s;upply'd the Defects in the former Provi&s;ion; and in this A&s;&s;urance, they humbly pre&s;ent this Bill al&s;o for the Royal A&s;&s;ent.</HI></P>
<P>I add here, and to confirm the Character of this Parliament, the Acknowledgment return'd by the Regents to the Parliament for all this which was given in the King's Name; when the Bills being Pre&s;ented and Sign'd, the Hou&s;es were Adjourn'd to the 25th.</P></Q>

The Regents having thus carry'd on their Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, through the &s;hort Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament with Succe&s;s; the Government began to &s;ettle, and e|very thing went on &s;mooth, and ea&s;y: The People were indeed a little Tumultuous, but it was at fir&s;t rather on the Side of the Government, than again&s;t it. For not a Hand &s;tirr'd, or offer'd to lift it &s;elf up again&s;t the Succe&s;&s;ion, or again&s;t the Admini&s;tration. The Rabbles which were at all di&s;turbing, were from &s;ome hot People who were willing to have &s;hewn their Re&s;entment at the Mini&s;try of the late Reign their own Way, and tho&s;e were not a little ex|cited and &s;tirr'd up to Di&s;order by the &s;curillous Li|bels and Pamphlets publi&s;h'd at that time, reflecting upon the whole Proceedings of the Mini&s;try, and Friends of the latter End of the late Reign, as one united, concerted Plot and Con&s;piracy again&s;t the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, and the Per&s;on of King GEORGE.</P>
<P>It is enough to mention the&s;e things as Matter of Hi&s;tory, it is not my Bu&s;ine&s;s to debate with them, or about the Ju&s;tice or Inju&s;tice of them. The fir&s;t Evidence of the Truth of this, was in the Per&s;on of Mon&s;. <HI>D' Ibberville,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Re&s;ident here, who found him&s;elf oblig'd to apply him&s;elf to the Lords of the <HI>Regency,</HI> to protect him from the In&s;ults of the Rabble; which they readi|ly granted, ordering a Detachment of the Guards to do Duty at his Hou&s;e, for that Pur|po&s;e; and the &s;aid Mon&s;. <HI>D' Ibberville,</HI> in return, a&s;&s;ur'd the <HI>Regency,</HI> that <HI>his Ma&s;ter would give no Di&s;turbance to the E&s;tabli&s;hment of His Maje&s;ty on the Throne: But would inviolably maintain the Ar|ticles of the Treaty of</HI> Utrecht, <HI>which related to the Settlement of the Crown on the Illu&s;trious Hou&s;e of</HI> Hanover. It was &s;ugge&s;ted, maliciou&s;ly enough, by &s;ome, that Mon&s;. <HI>D' Ibberville,</HI> did this with|out
<PB N="29" REF="30">
Orders, and even before he had receiv'd any An&s;wer from <HI>France</HI> to the Account he had tran&s;|mitted thither of Her late Maje&s;ty's Death. But they who in&s;inuated this &s;poke without Book; Mon&s;. <HI>D' Ibberville</HI> having receiv'd an Expre&s;s from <HI>France</HI> the Evening before, and they mu&s;t under|&s;tand very little of the Duty of a publick Mini&s;ter, or how punctually the King of <HI>France</HI> is &s;erv'd on all Occa&s;ions, or have a very mean and unworthy Opinion of Mon&s;. <HI>D' Ibberville,</HI> to &s;uppo&s;e he would have made &s;uch a Declaration, in the Name of his Ma&s;ter, without particular Orders &s;o to do: But this Reproach was immediately taken off from his Excellency by two concurring Te&s;timo|nies to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e; 1. That the Earl of <HI>Peterborough,</HI> who arriv'd in <HI>England</HI> the next Day, <HI>viz.</HI> the 7th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> a&s;&s;ur'd the <HI>Regency,</HI> that being at the <HI>French</HI> Court when the News of the Queens Death came thither, by Expre&s;s from Mon&s;. <HI>D' Ibberville,</HI> the King of <HI>France</HI> had &s;ent for his Lord&s;hip, and had a&s;&s;ur'd him of the &s;ame, from his own Mouth, and in the very &s;ame Words, or to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, that Mon&s;. <HI>D' Ibberville</HI> had done. 2. That Mr. <HI>Prior,</HI> then the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Re&s;ident at the Court of <HI>France,</HI> having notified the Death of the Queen to the <HI>French</HI> Court, had &s;ignified to the Lords of the <HI>Regency,</HI> that he had receiv'd A&s;&s;urances in the like Terms from the King's own Mouth.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides all this, the Lords of the <HI>Regency,</HI> receiv'd a few Days after, a Letter from the <HI>French</HI> Court, Sign'd by his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty's own Hand to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e; importing farther, that the Elector of <HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> having &s;ome time before the Queen's Death, &s;ignify'd to his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, that when ever his Succe&s;&s;ion &s;hould take place, he
<PB N="30" REF="31">
would Cultivate a Friend&s;hip with his &s;aid Ma|je&s;ty; His &s;aid Maje&s;ty, on his part, a&s;&s;ur'd the Lords of the <HI>Regency,</HI> that he would do all that lay in his Power, to maintain a good Intelligence and Amity between the two Crowns, and to pre|&s;erve the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht</HI> in all its Parts, and particularly in that part of it which related to the Renunciations, which he re&s;olv'd to &s;uffer no Al|terations in, and that he had &s;ignify'd the &s;ame already to his Grand&s;on King <HI>Philip.</HI></P>
<P>As the&s;e things concurr'd to make the King's Affairs ea&s;ie Abroad, the Nece&s;&s;ity of the King's &s;peedy coming over was not &s;o great, as to hin|der His Maje&s;ty from di&s;patching all &s;uch other Affairs in His <HI>German</HI> Dominions, as requir'd his &s;tay. And this, no Que&s;tion, the Lords of the <HI>Regency</HI> meant, in the Expre&s;&s;ions to the Par|liament, in the Speech mention'd above, which relates to this, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>&startq;We are a&s;&s;ur'd, that if this, <HI>(viz.</HI> the Peace and Safety of his Dominions) had requir'd his more immediate Pre&s;ence, he would, without the lea&s;t Delay, have repair'd hither, for the Support of &s;o dutiful and faith|ful Subjects.&endq;</Q> But all was quiet at Home, and clear Abroad, not a Hand mov'd, or Tongue &s;poke again&s;t the Succe&s;&s;ion of King GEORGE, either at Home, or Abroad: and his Maje&s;ty, except for the Appearance, might with the &s;ame Safety have come over, as an ordinary Pa&s;&s;enger in the Pac|quet-Boat, as with a Squadron of Men of War.</P>
<P>However, that His Maje&s;ty might have all things ready for His Voyage, when His Foreign Affairs were &s;ettled, and might have it in his Power to Embark when he pleas'd, and to Sail as His Occa&s;ions requir'd, Wind and Wea|ther pre&s;enting. I &s;ay, For this Purpo&s;e, all the
<PB N="31" REF="32">
Yachts were ordered to be got ready, with all po&s;|ble &s;peed, and a &s;trong Squadron of Men of War, under the Command of the Earl of <HI>Berkley,</HI> was appointed for their Convoy, and &s;uch Expedition was u&s;ed in this Equipment, that they arriv'd in <HI>Holland</HI> the 17th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> and caus'd an Expre&s;s to be &s;ent to <HI>Hanover,</HI> to acquaint the King with his Arrival, and that he was there attending His Orders.</P>
<P>On Board the Yachts, were all the proper Officers of the Green-Cloth, who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s it is to appoint the Kitchin, the Table, the Furniture, and Lodgings for the Royal Hou&s;e; and they had with them, all nece&s;&s;ary Officers, and Provi|&s;ions accordingly, for the U&s;e of the King and His Retinue.</P>
<P>While this was doing, the Lords of the <HI>Regency</HI> had before them, the ordinary Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Admini&s;tration, which was all in perfect Order, nor did any thing uncommon, or difficult, or un|u&s;ual occur to them; except &s;uch things as related to the placing or di&s;placing &s;ome particular Men, in which they acted neither one way or other, but as they receiv'd po&s;itive Directions from the King: As to what was Extraordinary, the principal Thing before them, was the Funeral of Her late Maje&s;ty, and the Mourning on that Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Her Maje&s;ty Died on <HI>Sunday</HI> the 1&s;t of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> in the Morning, as has been ob&s;erv'd; on the <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> after, Her Body was open'd, and by the Re|port of the Surgeons, all the Vitals, the Bowels, and Stomach, were exceeding &s;ound and firm, and nothing was to be found there, which had any Symptoms of Di&s;ea&s;e; &s;o that it was &s;uppos'd the Cau&s;e of Her Death was to have been found in the Head, which Her Maje&s;ty having expre&s;ly
<PB N="32" REF="33">
forbid to be open'd, the Surgeons ceas'd any far|ther Enquiry: The Body was Embalm'd, and the Bowels buried the next Night, in the Royal Repo&s;itory at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter.</HI> On <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the <HI>Earl Mar&s;hal</HI> publi&s;h'd an Order for a General Mourn|ing, as u&s;ual in &s;uch Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Lords waited the King's Orders, for the Interment, which arriv'd &s;oon af|ter; Importing, that the Body &s;hould be Interr'd with all Decency and Magnificence, &s;uch as, how|ever, was to con&s;i&s;t with the Form of a pri|vate Funeral; which was accordingly done the 24th of <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>It was intended to have buried Her Maje&s;ty the 22d, nor could I ever be inform'd of the true Rea&s;on why it was put off, and appointed the 24th, unle&s;s I &s;hould be &s;o uncharitable as to judge, as &s;ome have &s;aid, that it was on Purpo&s;e &s;o contriv'd, by de&s;igning Men, that the Funeral might be attended with all the unhapy Circum|&s;tances of that Day, which has been e&s;teem'd among tho&s;e we call <HI>Dies Infau&s;taus,</HI> being the Day of the Ma&s;&s;acre of <HI>Paris,</HI> and the Day of the turning out the Di&s;&s;enters from the Benefices they Injoy'd in the Church; which turning out they are pleas'd to call Per&s;ecution, and on that account to &s;tile the Day, by the Name of <HI>Black Bartholomew.</HI> Nor &s;hould I have mention'd this, had it not been taken notice of by them&s;elves, and the Memory of the Queen in&s;ulted on that very Account in a pub|lick and dete&s;table manner.</P>
<P>This Book being a Hi&s;tory of the Reign of King GEORGE, allows not an Entrance into the Per&s;on and Character of the Queen, which mu&s;t carry us back to things beyond the Beginning of our Work. But another Rea&s;on of
<PB N="33" REF="34">
more Moment obliges me to leave that &s;ubject, <HI>viz.</HI> That I am inform'd it is doing at this Time by a Pen &s;o much abler to do Her Maje&s;ty's Memory Ju&s;tice, upon the &s;candalous Abu&s;es of Her Cha|racter and Conduct, and &s;o much better acquain|ted with the particular Circum&s;tances of Her Reign, than tho&s;e, who with Ignorance, equal to their Malice, have in&s;ulted and reproach'd Her; I think it therefore much better to omit any farther Enrance upon that Subject, except only this, that the Treatment Her Maje&s;ty's Memory has re|ceiv'd from &s;ome People in this Reign, as well in Print, as otherwi&s;e, has not only been unju&s;t and unworthy, but inimitably Rude; and &s;uch, as I believe, no Age can &s;hew us the like in Hi&s;tory: When at the &s;ame time, Malice it &s;elf cannot de|ny Her Maje&s;ty to have been a Prince&s;s of &s;potle&s;s Vertue, fill'd with Charity and Clemency; of an univer&s;al Benignity and Goodne&s;s; of exemplary Piety, Tenderne&s;s, and Affection, for the Good, Peace, and Pro&s;perity of Her People, unpara|lell'd, and inimitable.</P>
<P>But I leave the ungrateful Subject, &s;uch a Queen &s;o treated, obliges me indeed to call it &s;o: I leave it, I &s;ay, and &s;hall conclude all that relates to Her Maje&s;ty, in the following Account of Her Funeral.</P>
<P>Her Maje&s;ty's Body being thus Depo&s;ited, and the Counterfeit Mourning of many put on, the Hypocri&s;y of which they were not a&s;ham'd to ac|knowledge; which, indeed, is my Authority for

into the <HI>Palace-Yard,</HI> and thence to the South-Ea&s;t Door of the Abby, one of the great Guns at the Tower firing every Minute, until Her Maje&s;ty was interr'd. The Royal Corps was born under a Canopy of Purple Velvet, preceded by a great Number of Her Servants, the Judges, Privy-Councellors, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the great Officers. The Pall was &s;upported by Six Dukes. Her Grace the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Or|mond,</HI> (in the Ab&s;ence of the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Somer|&s;et,</HI> who was indi&s;pos'd) was chief Mourner, &s;up|ported by the Dukes of <HI>Somer&s;et</HI> and <HI>Richmond</HI> in long Cloaks, wearing their Collars of the Or|der, her Train born by Two Dutche&s;&s;es, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Vice-Chamberlain, and follow'd by Two other Dutche&s;&s;es, at the Head of Fourteen Coun|te&s;&s;es as A&s;&s;i&s;tants, all in long Veils of black Crape; and after them the Ladies of the Bed-Chamber, and the Maids of Honour in like Veils; then the Bed-Chamber Women, and the Gentlemen Pen&s;ioners, clo&s;ed the Proceedings. At the Enterance into the Church, the Dean, Prebends and Choir re|ceiv'd the Royal Body with an Anthem, and marching before <HI>Norroy,</HI> King of Arms, who car|ried the Crown and Cu&s;hion, they proceeded &s;inging to King <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh's Chappel; where being arriv'd, the Body was depo&s;ited on Tre&s;&s;els, while the Service of the Church was perform'd by the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> Dean of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> and afterwards interr'd in the &s;ame Vault, with King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, King <HI>William,</HI> Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and Prince <HI>George</HI> of <HI>Denmark.</HI></P>
<P>Her Maje&s;ty's Body being thus Depo&s;ited, and the Counterfeit Mourning of many put on, the Hypocri&s;y of which they were not a&s;ham'd to ac|knowledge; which, indeed, is my Authority for

making &s;uch mention of it. The Lords of the <HI>Re|gency</HI> continu'd their nece&s;&s;ary Care of the Admini|&s;tration, but waiting, <HI>as the Nation did al&s;o mo&s;t im|patiently,</HI> the King's Arrival, They acted nothing more than Duty and Nece&s;&s;ity oblig'd them to, except what they receiv'd immediate and expre&s;s Orders for from the King.</P>
<P>However, in Execution of tho&s;e Orders &s;ome|thing Extraordinary was then nece&s;&s;ary, as parti|cularly, a Patent was order'd to pa&s;s the Seals for Creating the Electoral Prince, the King's elde&s;t and only Son, Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> this was accord|ingly prepared, and brought through all the ne|ce&s;&s;ary Steps, except Sealing with the Great Seal, which was, it &s;eems, re&s;erv'd for an Ho|nour to the new Chancellor, which was to be, and as will be &s;een in its Place.</P>
<P>Al&s;o, at the &s;ame time, came over an Order to re|move the Lord <HI>Bolingbroke</HI> from his Office of Secre|tary of State, which was done with this Addition, as the Prelude to that noble Per&s;on's Misfortunes, <HI>viz.</HI> That by Order of the Lords of the <HI>Regen|cy</HI> his Lord&s;hip's Papers were Seized, and his Office Sealed up. However, his Lord&s;hip receiv'd the&s;e Marks of the King's Di&s;plea&s;ure with a becoming Decency, and even his Enemies do not charge him with Mi&s;sbehaviour upon the Occa&s;ion. The Per&s;ons &s;ent to him to demand the Seals from his Lord&s;hip, were the Dukes of <HI>Shrowsbury</HI> and <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Cowper,</HI> &s;ince made Chancellor; all the three <HI>which is &s;omething remarkable,</HI> having in a little time lain under the &s;ame Circum&s;tances of being remov'd from all publick Employment, and afforded us Occa|&s;ion to mention them in this Hi&s;tory on that Account.</P>
<P>The remaining Part of the time of this <HI>Regency</HI> af|fords us more Matter of Hi&s;tory from Abroad, than

at Home, the King having been thus Pro|claim'd, and E&s;tabli&s;h'd on the Throne at Home had new Negotiations to &s;et on Foot, and new Intere&s;ts to cultivate Abroad, for the Secnrity of his Affairs, as King, and for the making proper Alliances, as King of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> And the&s;e took up much time.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing the King Ordered was a publick Thank&s;giving, or <HI>Te Deum</HI> to be Sung after the manner of the <HI>Lutheran</HI> Church, through all his forreign Dominions, for his Acce&s;&s;ion to the Throne. The next was to &s;ubjoyn Prayers to be made at the &s;ame time for his peaceable and pro&s;perous Reign. After this follow'd the Congratulations of his own Subjects, the Nobility, and Per&s;ons of Quality who throng'd to <HI>Herenhau&s;en,</HI> the King's Country Seat or Palace, where there was a very numerous Court, to felicitate his Maje&s;ty, and Ki&s;s his Hand.</P>
<P>From the&s;e Ceremonies of the Court, they pro|ceeded to tho&s;e of the State, <HI>viz.</HI> To notify the King's Acce&s;&s;ion to the Crown, to all the Courts, Princes, and States of <HI>Europe,</HI> which was done as well by the Lords of the <HI>Regency,</HI> from <HI>London,</HI> in his Maje&s;ty's Name to &s;ome, as from the King him&s;elf to others; the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> at the <HI>Hague,</HI> Mr. <HI>Prior</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> notify'd it by Order of the <HI>Regency</HI> to the States-General, and to the Court of <HI>France,</HI> and both were receiv'd as pub|lick Mini&s;ters of the Crown of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> at the re&s;pective Courts where they re&s;ide.

County belonging to the Earl of <HI>Albemarle;</HI> On the 4th, He was received by the Deputies of the States-General, appointed to Compliment Him upon their Frontiers, and that &s;ame Night the King enter'd the &s;aid Territories of the States-General, and went on to <HI>Utrecht;</HI> where they only &s;taid to receive the Compliment of the States of that Province, and going on Board a Yacht appointed by the States to receive them, reached as far as <HI>Woorden</HI> that Night: Here His Maje&s;ty was again received by the Earl of <HI>Albe|marle,</HI> and the Deputies of the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> and was Saluted with 54 Pieces of Cannon, being as many as he was Years Old.</P>
<P>On the 5th the King went into the Earl of <HI>Al|bemarle</HI>'s Coach, His Attendants following in other Coaches, and a Detachment of the Hor&s;e Guards appointed to attend Him to <HI>Ley|den,</HI> where he was again Saluted with 54 Guns, and making no Stay there, arriv'd at 5 a Clock at Night at the <HI>Hague.</HI></P>
<P>Here he was attended by a &s;olemn Deputation from the States-General, to welcome His Maje&s;ty and the Prince into their Country, and His Court was throng'd with the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nobility and Gentry, who had crowded over thither upon the Occa&s;ion; and here his Maje&s;ty held a very great and magnificent Court; here His Maje&s;ty was waited on by, and gave Audience to all the Foreign Amba&s;&s;adors: Such as the Duke <HI>d' O&s;&s;una,</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>Spain;</HI> the Marquis <HI>de Chateau|neuf,</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>France;</HI> the Count <HI>de Tarouca,</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>Portugal;</HI> and others.</P>
<P>In the Middle of the&s;e Ceremonies, &s;everal Matters of State were concerted by His Maje&s;ty's Direction, with the States General. And News

<P>The King continu'd at the <HI>Hague</HI> till the 16th of <HI>September</HI> Old Stile, when the Wind pre&s;enting fair, the whole Retinue embark'd, the King went on Board the <HI>Peregrine</HI> Yacht, Capt. <HI>Saunder&s;on</HI> Commander; the Prince in the <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> and having a very fair Wind, they Weighed imme|diately, and Stood out to Sea, the Squadron of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Men of War, 15 in all, joyning them at the Mouth of the <HI>Ma&s;e;</HI> they were but one Night at Sea, for in the Morning early, the Men of War came into the Mouth of the <HI>Thames,</HI> in Sight of <HI>Margat;</HI> and as the Weather was exceed|ing Plea&s;ant, the Sea &s;mooth, and the Wind fair, the King order'd the Yachts to go on, declining to go on Shore: That &s;ame Evening, the Yachts with the King reach'd to the <HI>Hope,</HI> below <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> where the Men of War came to an Anchor. And it being a thick Fog, the King lay on Board all Night; the next Day, about Noon, the Yachts weighed, and came up as high as <HI>Long-reach,</HI> where Night coming on, the King and Prince went into their Barges, and came to <HI>Greenwich</HI> that Evening, where they Landed about &s;ix a Clock, having been met by an infinite Throng of People, in Boats upon the River, even quite as low as <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> encrea&s;ing &s;till, as they came nearer the Town, and by a Prodigious Crow'd on Shore; who, it being too Dark to di&s;tingui&s;h the King, were greatly di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>The Ceremonies of the meeting, and Reception of the King, and the Acclamations of the People, being always &s;uch, on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, mu&s;t be pa&s;t over here; they are too long to give a parti|cular

Account of, in this Work, nor are they E&s;|&s;ential to our Bu&s;ine&s;s. But &s;ome Account of this two Nights Court at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the Story in Hand, for here, and in this &s;hort time, are &s;aid to begin all tho&s;e Steps which have been, if &s;ome &s;ay true, the main Spring and Occa&s;ion of all the Mi&s;chiefs which happen'd &s;ince.</P>
<P>The Moment His Maje&s;ty &s;et his Foot on Shore upon <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ground, the Commi&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Regency</HI> Di&s;&s;olv'd of Cour&s;e, and the Executive Power no longer to be exercis'd by Deputation, revolv'd immediately upon His Maje&s;ty's own Hands.</P>
<P>This had been long'd for many Days, and it may be truly &s;aid, that the Nation in General wi&s;h'd earne&s;tly for the King's Coming; not that the <HI>Regency</HI> acted out of their Duty. But it could be no Reproach to them, to &s;ay that it was not doubted, but, that when the King came to take the Admini&s;tration into His own Hands, it would be better, and that their Management might be called indifferent compared to tho&s;e Shoulders on which, fitted by Nature, the Load of Govern|ment was appointed to be laid: In which Ca&s;e one &s;aid at that time.</P>

<P>The Particulars of the King's Reception in foreign Parts, as he pa&s;s'd to the Sea Side to Embark, the Speeches and Compliments made to him at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and in other Places, before he arriv'd there, are too many and too remote from

the De&s;ign of this Work al&s;o to be plac'd here; be|ing &s;ufficiently touch'd at already, I come at once to the King's more immediate Admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>The Evening that the King Arriv'd, no Bu&s;i|ne&s;s was done, the King being fateigu'd, if I may call it &s;o, with Ceremony, as well as with the Voyage, Di&s;mi&s;s'd the Court early, and retired into His Apartments; &s;ome indeed were admit|ted there, but they were only &s;uch &s;elect Per&s;ons, who it was apparent &s;har'd of His Maje&s;ty's particular Favour and Confidence.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Act of Government the King exerted, at lea&s;t which was publick, was a Me&s;&s;age &s;ent by the Lord <HI>Town&s;hend</HI> to the Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> to this Purpo&s;e, <HI>viz. That the King had no longer Occa&s;ion for his Service, in the Quality of Captain General of the Army;</HI> it is &s;aid, that it was further added, to &s;hew &s;ome Re&s;pect, that however, <HI>the King would be glad to &s;ee him at Court.</HI> But how true that may be, I do not affirm.</P>
<P>It is not much doubted, but as this Step was taken the fir&s;t Night of the King's Arrival, &s;o the whole Scheme of the new Mini&s;try was &s;ettled there al&s;o, the next Day; &s;eeing it was ea&s;y to di&s;cover, the next Morning, when the King &s;hew'd him&s;elf in the Apartments, who were IN, tho' not &s;o evidently who were OUT.</P>
<P>About 10 a Clock the King came out of His Bed-Chamber, and appear'd in open Court, which was at that time, promi&s;cuou&s;ly throng'd with the Nobility, and Gentry, of every Denomina|tion; who had, without Exception, the Honour to Ki&s;s His Maje&s;ty's Hand. Yet, as above, though all were admitted, it was no hard thing to di&s;tingui&s;h who had the Honour to be more immediately acceptable.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="45">
It was even there al&s;o known, tho' not parti|cularly declar'd, that the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> was to have the Battoon, or Command of the Army; that Mr. <HI>W&mdash;</HI>would be at the Head of the Trea&s;ury; that the Lord <HI>Town&s;hend</HI> would have the Seals of Office, as Secretary of State; and al&s;o, that the Lord <HI>Cowper</HI> would be made Lord Chan|cellor: The Duke of <HI>Argyle,</HI> who had now recon|cil'd him&s;elf with the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> ap|pear'd next to the Prince, as the other did next the King.</P>
<P>In this manner Things went tho&s;e two Nights, when all Matters &s;eem'd to receive &s;ome Interrup|tion by the nece&s;&s;ary Di&s;po&s;itions which were to be made for the Royal Entry, or the Cavalcade through the City, which was appointed for <HI>Mon|day</HI> the 20th of <HI>September.</HI> The Earl Mar&s;hal was con&s;ulted, for the Order of this Entry, and Di|rections given him to i&s;&s;ue out his Orders for the Precedency, and manner of the Proce&s;&s;ion, which was accordingly done. And is as follows:</P>
<Q><P><HI>WHERE AS the Solemnity of the King's Roy|al Entry from</HI> Greenwich, <HI>through the City of</HI> London, <HI>to His</HI> Royal Palace <HI>of</HI> St. James<HI>'s, is appointed to be on</HI> Monday <HI>the 20th of this Instant</HI> September,; <HI>This is therefore to give Notice to all the Nobility, and others, who are to attend the King in their Coaches, that they repair to</HI> Greenwich Park, <HI>&s;o as to be there by Ten of the Clock that Morn|ing at farthe&s;t; where their Coaches will be put in Order by the Officers of Arms appointed for that Purpo&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And that the Lord-Mayor, Aldermen, Recorder, and Sheriffs of</HI> London, <HI>with &s;uch as have &s;erv'd or fin'd for Aldermen or Sheriffs of the &s;aid City; the City</HI>
<PB N="45" REF="46">
<HI>Officers, and the Detachment of the</HI> Artillery-Com|pany; <HI>as al&s;o the Knight Mar&s;hal's Men, the King's Kettle Drums and Trumpets, the King's Heralds, and Serjeant at Armes, the Gentleman-U&s;her of the black Rod, and the Officers and Yeomen of His Maje|&s;hy's Guards,</HI> amp;c. <HI>do meet in</HI> Southwark, <HI>about Twelve of the Clock, and extend them&s;elves in the Order they are to March from the Foot of</HI> London-Bridge <HI>to</HI> St. Margaret's-Hill, <HI>and there wait His Maje&s;ty's Arrival; and &s;o &s;oon as Notice is given that the Coaches are coming into</HI> Kent-Street, <HI>they are all to be mar&s;halled in their due Order by the Officers of Arms.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Accordingly on the 20th of <HI>September,</HI> the King made His Entry through the City, with the u&s;ual Form, and with all the Tokens of a mo&s;t joyful Reception; the Particulars of the Ceremony are too tedious for this Work, in which I ha&s;ten to things of the greate&s;t Con&s;equence.</P>
<P>The next Morning, there was a numerous Throng of the Nobility and Gentry, to pay their Compliments, and to Ki&s;s the King's Hand, as al&s;o the Mini&s;ters of <HI>France, Sicily, Pru&s;&s;ia, Po|land, Portugal,</HI> and others; the &s;ame Day in the Evening the Privy-Council a&s;&s;embled, where His Maje&s;ty appear'd, and took the Oath, and &s;ub|&s;crib'd the In&s;trument of Security relating to the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as requir'd by Law, the Lord's of the Council pre&s;ent, Signing the &s;ame as Witne&s;&s;es; there were Duplicates of the In&s;tru|ment &s;ign'd, one whereof was entered in the Books of the Council, and lodg'd in the Records here, and the other &s;ent down to be pre&s;erv'd in the publick Regi&s;ter in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to be enter'd in the Books of the Court of Se&s;&s;ion there, which is,
<PB N="46" REF="47">
what they call their College of Ju&s;tice. After this, the King made the following Declaration to the Council, and in a full Meeting. And the Lords, in Return, reque&s;ted that it might be made pub|lick, which was order'd accordingly. And is as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<Q><P><HI>HAving in my An&s;wers to the Addre&s;&s;es of both Hou&s;es of Parliament, fully expre&s;s'd my Re&s;o|lution to defend the Religious and Civil Rights of all My Subjects, there remains very little for me to &s;ay up|on this Occa&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Yet being willing to omit no Opportunity of giving all po&s;&s;ible A&s;&s;urances to a People, who have already de&s;erved &s;o well of Me; I take this Occa&s;ion al&s;o, to expre&s;s to you my firm Purpo&s;e to do all that is in My Power, for the Supporting and Maintaining the Churches of</HI> England <HI>and</HI> Scotland, <HI>as they are &s;everally by Law E&s;tabli&s;h'd; which, I am of Opini|on, may be effectually done, without the lea&s;t im|pairing the Toleration, allowed by Law to</HI> Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters, <HI>&s;o agreeable to</HI> Chri&s;tian <HI>Charity, and &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the Trade and Riches of this King|dom.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The good Effects of making Property &s;ecure are no where &s;o clearly &s;een, and to &s;o great a Degree, as in this Happy Kingdom; and I a&s;&s;ure you, That there is not any among you, &s;hall more earne&s;tly Endeavour the Pre&s;ervation of it than My &s;elf.</HI></P></Q>
<P>The &s;ame time, the King nam'd &s;everal new Privy-Councellors, as fir&s;t the Prince, who was introduc'd in Particular, and took his Place on the Right Hand, next to the King, after which, the Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>York,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> the Lord <HI>Hallifax</HI> were Nam'd by the King, and
<PB N="47" REF="48">
were immediately Sworn, and took their Places at the Board.</P>
<P>Then the King declar'd the Lord Vi&s;count <HI>Town&s;hend,</HI> Secretary of State; the Earl of <HI>Notting|ham,</HI> Lord Pre&s;ident of the Council; the Earl of <HI>Wharton,</HI> Lord Privy-Seale; the Earl of <HI>Sunderland,</HI> Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland;</HI> and the Lord <HI>Cowper,</HI> Lord High Chancellor of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>Addre&s;&s;es now began to croud in from all Parts, to Congratulate the King's Acce&s;&s;ion, as is Natu|ral on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, and in Particular, the two Univer&s;ities, the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council of the City of <HI>London,</HI> and par|ticularly the Clergy of <HI>London;</HI> the&s;e led the Way. It would be endle&s;s to give the Detail of the Places from whence, much le&s;s the Petitions them&s;elves, nor is it at all nece&s;&s;ary, they being generally things &s;omething a-like in their Manner, as they are in their End.</P>
<P>One of the fir&s;t things of Moment, which oc|cur'd in the Sphere of the New Lord Chancellor, and the fir&s;t Patent which pa&s;t the Great Seal in this Reign, was that of Creating the King's elde&s;t and only Son, Prince of <HI>Wales.</HI> This was order'd &s;oon after his Lord&s;hip had the Seals, and was declar'd in Council, his Name and Titles run thus, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>On the 20th the Coronation was perform'd with all the Pomp and Ceremony u&s;ual on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, the whole was very Magnificent, but was attended with &s;ome unhappy Accidents, <HI>viz.</HI> the fall of &s;everal Scaffolds $Word$ Stages erected. for Spectators, by which, the Crowd being great, many were hurt, and &s;ome kill'd out|right; the Scaffolds in the <HI>Palace-Yard</HI> fell, ju&s;t as the Proce&s;&s;ion was coming by.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="57">
By this time, the Di&s;&s;atisfactions of the people began to di&s;cover them&s;elves a little; the Methods which the Court had taken, and &s;eem'd re&s;olv'd to take, in the di&s;placing one Side, and putting in the other, almo&s;t univer&s;ally, could not but di&s;oblige many; and the Coronation Day being celebrated all over the Nation, the Mobs and Tumuits which appear'd on that Occa&s;ion, were, as I may &s;ay, the Beginning of that Temper which afterwards &s;pread it &s;elf almo&s;t over the whole Kingdom.</P>
<P>Nor was the bare di&s;placing the Old Mini&s;try, and all the Friends of that Side, or the putting in the New Men, the main Spring the Peoples Di&s;&s;atisfactions, &s;o much as the Warmth of tho&s;e People who pretended to be gratify'd in the Change; tho&s;e were not content to be in Power, or to &s;ee their Friends wholly po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of the Royal Favour, and have Opportunity to xert the Power of the Government in the Intere&s;t of their Party; but they immediately turn'd upon tho&s;e who they now look'd upon as under Foot, with bitter Reproaches, Taunts, Threatnings, and all manner of Triumph that could be thought of; or could indeed be practis'd, by a conquering Enemy, over a vanqui&s;h'd Pri&s;oner; in&s;ul|ing them with opprobious Language, un&s;uffer|able to Men of Honour and Spirit, and threat|ning them with the utmo&s;t Revenge and Re&s;ent|ment.</P>
<P>Let no Man mi&s;take this, to &s;ignify that either the King, or any of His Mini&s;try did thus, or en|courag'd the doing of this. His Maje&s;ty having fill'd up the great Employments of the Court, with M$n who he thought be&s;t capable to execute the Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them, mo&s;t de&s;erving of, and
<PB N="57" REF="58">
attacht to the Intere&s;t of him&s;elf, and the Royal Family, might well in the Infancy, or at lea&s;t, the Youth of His Government, give them a Loo&s;e in their Conduct, to judge for him in many things what was fitte&s;t to be done, and whether Lenity or Severity were the mo&s;t proper to begin the Schemes of the New Admini&s;tration with, in re&s;pect to tho&s;e who went before them.</P>
<P>Clearing therefore, entirely, the King and all His <HI>German</HI> Mini&s;try of being any way the Occa|&s;ion of any Mea&s;ures which might be taken to en|courage the Pa&s;&s;ions of Men in Power, to carry on the Party Re&s;entments mention'd above, and from which, many of the Misfortunes which fol|lowed may be &s;aid to derive. Clearing, I &s;ay, the King, and His Friends, from the Charge en|tirely, and leaving it undetermin'd, who of the New Mini&s;try, were, or were not mi&s;taken in their fir&s;t Mea&s;ures, I choo&s;e to &s;peak of the Fer|ment of Parties without Doors, from whence, as from a troubled Fountain, i&s;&s;ued afterwards, Di&s;|content, Faction, Rage, Tumult, Riot, Fight|ing, Plundering, Demoli&s;hing Hou&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and in a Word, all kind of Popular Di&s;traction. At Court, this was follow'd with Flight of Di&s;con|tented Lords, Throanings, Impeachments, Im|pri&s;onments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> till at length, altogether I&s;&s;ued in bidding Defiance to the Government. And Men of Dignity being made De&s;perate, &s;ought Shelter very unhappily in Trea&s;on and Rebellion.</P>
<P>I might follow Truth too clo&s;e at the Heels, as was &s;aid of a much better Hi&s;torian, if I &s;hould Trace the Cau&s;es of all the&s;e things nearer than I have done in this brief Recapitulation of the fir&s;t Movemente in this Reign. I return to the Hi&s;tory in which the Relation it &s;elf will di&s;co|ver
<PB N="58" REF="59">
without any farther Paraphra&s;e, whether it be true or not, that all the future Di&s;tractions took their Ri&s;e as above.</P>
<P>The Coronation being over, Matters of Ceremony Ended, and the great Offices fill'd up, with Men of the highe&s;t Figure and Cha|racter, on that Side, they began to enter upon the Admini&s;tration. Frequent Councils were held upon the Mea&s;ures in which, even in the Infancy of Things, they did not agree perfectly; there happen'd to be ONE Per&s;on plac'd at the Head of Bu&s;ine&s;s, who &s;till retain'd true Principles of Go|vernment; and who having by his extraordinary Genius, and long Experience in the Admini&s;tration of Affairs under the like Agitation of Parties, in former Reigns, &s;een the mi&s;chievous Con&s;equences of Arming the Parties one again&s;t another, feeding the Fire of Men's Pa&s;&s;ions on the one hand, or pu&s;hing Men to De&s;perations on the other; and being a Friend to moderate Councils, on every Hand, oppo&s;ed him&s;elf though with Calmne&s;s, and powerful Rea&s;onings, to the Heat of &s;ome other People, who were for carrying on the Govern|ment upon the Ba&s;is of Ju&s;tice, as they call'd it, to their Enemies.</P>
<P>When, I &s;ay, there was ONE Per&s;on of &s;uch noble and &s;uperior Principles, in this fir&s;t Mini|&s;try, I do not &s;ugge&s;t that there was BUT ONE; but I may be allow'd to &s;ay, that I believe there was none &s;tood &s;o firm to the la&s;t, in his Judgment of the be&s;t Mea&s;ures which were to be taken for the fixing and e&s;tabli&s;hing the King in the Throne, and for preventing the evil Con&s;equences which fol|low'd.</P>
<P>He had, indeed, this Advantage above mo&s;t Men of that time he liv'd in, <HI>viz.</HI> That his Zeal
<PB N="59" REF="60">
and Sincerity was unque&s;tion'd; his Under&s;tand|ing and Capacities unexceptionable; and his Attachment to the Royal Family un&s;u&s;pected; and above all, he was a Man who had never chang'd, which few in that Body of People, I am now &s;peaking of, could &s;ay of them&s;elves.</P>
<P>It was with &s;ome Warmth, that his propo&s;als of a more moderate Proceeding were received, and the new Managers began not only to argue again&s;t it, with &s;ome Reflections upon things pa&s;t; but let the Di&s;pute take Vent among the Com|mon People, with whom the Moderation of Pro|ceedings in former Times, were run down with great Clamour; and even King <HI>William</HI>'s Prudent Conduct, was now call'd a criminal Lenity.</P>
<P>This Method of putting the Argument into the Mouths of the People, was indeed very Particu|lar, and &s;trongly intimated, that they were put to it, by the Oppo&s;ition they met with, not|with&s;tanding the Majority in Number; and they had no better way to &s;upport their Opinion, than that of making it Popular: Having thus fir&s;t cry'd out to the People, from within, as if they had be&s;poke then Clamour, The People to&s;t the Ball back again to them, crying out to the Court, for Ju&s;tice; and thus tho&s;e moderate Things, were very unhappily over-rul'd in the Beginning; what the Con&s;equences of the&s;e Mea&s;ures were, Hi&s;tory will di&s;cover.</P>
<P>I &s;ay no more of this, for the&s;e Rea&s;ons. 1. Becau&s;e the excellent Per&s;on I mention'd, who was then over-rul'd, was &s;oon after &s;natch'd a|way by a lamented Death, before he &s;aw his Op|po&s;ers convinc'd, or come over to be of his O|pinion. 2. Becau&s;e the Warme&s;t of them after|wards

grew wi&s;er, were convinc'd by their own Experience, having liv'd to &s;ee that the Mea&s;ures they began with, when Circum&s;tances came to di&s;cover them further, were not &s;opracticable, or &s;o Capable of procuring the publick Tranquillity, as they expected; and &s;ome of them have, though late, alter'd their Conduct. But to return to the Relation of Fact.</P>
<P>Immediately after the Coronation, &s;ome fur|ther Alterations in the Employment, of great Men, remain yet to be mentiond; which I name now becau&s;e the whole Body of the New Court, might appear, before they might be &s;aid to en|ter upon Actiount. The&s;e were, as follows,</P>
<P N="1">1. The Duke of <HI>Kent,</HI> was made Con&s;table and Governor of <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> Ca&s;tle, and Keeper of the Park, and Fore&s;t of <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> in the Room of the Duke of <HI>Northumberland.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The Earl of <HI>Stairs,</HI> and <HI>Paul Methuen,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Sworn of the Privy-Council.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Duke of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> made Chamber|lain of the Hou&s;hold.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Dukes of <HI>Bolton, Rutland, Kent,</HI> and <HI>Argyle;</HI> with the Earls of <HI>Dor&s;et,</HI> and <HI>Hali|fax,</HI> were declar'd Knights of the Garter, and were in&s;tall'd the 9th of <HI>December.</HI></P>
<P>The u&s;ual and needful Time, for the meeting and &s;itting of the Parliament, began now to advance; the Government was fully fix'd; the Admini&s;tration was wholly now in the Hands of tho&s;e who the King de&s;ign'd to entru&s;t it with; and the Common People began on &s;everal Oc|ca&s;ions, and in &s;everal Places to be very Tumul|tuous and Unea&s;y, as has been mention'd.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="62">
The Parliament in being, which had &s;o effectu|ally &s;hewn their Zeal for His Maje&s;ty's Inte|re&s;t and Succe&s;&s;ion, in the Beginning of His Reign, and when, if ever, that Succe&s;&s;ion might be &s;aid to be capable of receiving any Attacks from any Per&s;on what&s;oever, were adjourn'd from the 19th of <HI>November,</HI> to the 15th of <HI>January;</HI> and many People entertain'd Hopes that they would then Sit, at lea&s;t for a while, that they might have had further Opportunities to have exerted them&s;elves in the Service of His Maje&s;ty, and their Country; in which ca&s;e, it was believ'd, the tumultuous Di&s;po&s;ition of the People, might have receiv'd a Due, becau&s;e an early Check; and the evil Con|&s;equences which follow'd have been prevented, or at lea&s;t things might, by the wi&s;e Di&s;po&s;itions of the Parliament between the Extreams on all Sides, been &s;o moderated, as that the Rea&s;on and Occa&s;ions, or Pretences of tho&s;e Di&s;contents &s;hould have been remov'd.</P>
<P>But things took another Turn, and the Tem|per of tho&s;e People, mention'd before, &s;eem'd not to de&s;ire Accommodations, but run all upon pun|i&s;hments of the Mi&s;managers in the preceding Reigns; upon Re&s;entments, and Revenge; cen&s;ur|ing all tho&s;e who recommended more moderat Mea&s;ures, as Enemies to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover;</HI> which furious Treatment &s;topt the Mouths of many, who were as &s;incere Friends to the Go|vernment, as any of them were; but who yet were of Opinion, that it was not the true Intere&s;t of the Kingdom, to carry Matters on to &s;uch Extreams, as they found &s;ome Men had in View.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="63">
But it was not a Time for &s;uch Men to give their Opinion, the Stream running, as I have ob|&s;erv'd, another Way. So a few Days after, it was apparent, a New Parliament was re&s;olv'd on, and accordingly, on the 15th of <HI>January</HI> a Proclama|tion was publi&s;h'd.</P>
<P>This Proclamation being very Extraordinary, for the Form, and great Exceptions being taken at &s;ome Expre&s;&s;ions in it, as if it was unduly In|termeddling with the Election it &s;elf, and direct|ing the Electors what Per&s;ons they &s;hould choo&s;e, I cannot omit in&s;erting here, becau&s;e great Con|tention follow'd among the Parties on both Sides, upon this Subject.</P>

<P>I do not lead my Readers to make their Judg|ment of this Proclamation, one Way or other, by my Opinion, but telling them the Objecti|on only, without any Explanations; leave them to make what Judgment their Rea&s;on dictates. Only adding, that the Pen was &s;et to Work on both Sides in the&s;e Di&s;putes, to the great di&s;quieting and di&s;turbing the Peace of the

But to return to the Affair of a New Parliament, which was now the main thing that Occupy'd the Parties.</P>
<P>It was at this Time, that a Pamphlet was pub|li&s;h'd, and di&s;pers'd privately over mo&s;t parts of the Kingdom, nay and of <HI>Ireland</HI> too, which gave great Offence to the Government, and in|deed did a great deal of Damage to the Intere&s;t. It was call'd, <HI>Engli&s;h Advice to the Freeholders of</HI> Great Britain. The Contents of the Pamphlet it &s;elf, the Mi&s;chief it did, and the Concern the Go|vernment was in to counter-act the De&s;ign of it, are as well to be &s;een in the Proclamation for &s;up|pre&s;&s;ing it, as if I were to give an Ab&s;tract of the Book it &s;elf.

<P>Given at Our Court at St. <HI>James</HI>'s, the 11th of <HI>January,</HI> 1714. In the fir&s;t Year of Our Reign.</P></Q>
<P>It was acknowledg'd, the Piece was Artfully written, and that one of the be&s;t Pens of that Par|ty was Employ'd in it; and the Zeal of the Parties appear'd, in that not the Reward of 1000 <HI>l.</HI> for the Author, or 500 <HI>l.</HI> for the Printer, could ever tempt any of tho&s;e who were Privy to it, as &s;ome of Nece&s;&s;ity mu&s;t be, to make the Di&s;covery.</P>
<P>It is true, that during this whole Interval, that is to &s;ay, from the placing the new Mini&s;try, to the meeting of this new Parliament, the King|dom felt un&s;ufferable Convul&s;ions: The Ferments which the Parties were come to, the Animo&s;ities with which they oppos'd one another, the Riots, Tumults, Rage, and ill Conduct, was &s;uch, as nothing but a Hand of Power &s;eem'd capable of Suppre&s;&s;ing; and any Man, tho' of but &s;mall Pene|tration, might perceive it would unavoidably come to Blows, and that no End could be put to it on both Sides without Blood.</P>
<P>It would take up more Room, not only than can be &s;par'd here, but even than this Book con|tains, to give a true Account of all the Feuds, Di&s;putes, Quarrels, Riots, Tumults, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the Con&s;equences of them which happen'd, from the celebrating the Joy of the Coronation-Day, for there the Rabbles began, to the meeting of this Parliament. But as they all ran like Rivers into
<PB N="68" REF="69">
the great Ocean of War and Rebellion, I need enter no farther into the Detail of them, than ju&s;t to mention, that at <HI>London, Bri&s;tol, Oxford, Man|che&s;ter, Shrewsbury,</HI> and many Towns more, in <HI>Shrop&s;hire, Che&s;hire, Stafford&s;hire, Lanca&s;hire,</HI> &amp;c. the Mobs were outragious, pull'd down Meeting-Hou&s;es, broke Windows, and Heads, and even at length came to Fire at one another with Mu&s;|quets and Pi&s;tols, whereby much Mi&s;chief was done, and &s;everal People kill'd, and more wound|ed; but of the&s;e things, I &s;hall find too much Occa&s;ion to &s;peak again hereafter.</P>
<P>According to the Return of the Writs for Electi|on, the Parliament was to meet the 17th of <HI>March,</HI> Previous to their Meeting, and in Con&s;e|quence of the Re&s;olution mention'd of entring in|to the Re&s;entments of the former Reign, and ex|amining the Conduct of the Mini&s;try of Queen ANNE, &s;everal Steps were taken, which more and more alarm'd all tho&s;e Gentlemen, who had been concern'd in tho&s;e Affairs</P>
<P>The fir&s;t more open Step to tho&s;e things was, that on the 11th of <HI>January,</HI> the Lord <HI>Town&s;hend,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Stanhope,</HI> both at that time Secretaries of State, were &s;ent by Order of Council, to the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> late Amba&s;&s;ador and Plenipotentiary at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and at <HI>Utrecht,</HI> to Demand from him the Original In&s;tructions, and Orders &s;ent him upon the Publick Account, during his Mini|&s;try Abroad; all Letters written by him, or to him, to, or from, any Per&s;on what&s;oever, relating to the Negotiations from the time of his being fir&s;t at the <HI>Hague.</HI> They were to be &s;eal'd up with his Lord&s;hip's Seal upon Delivery, and to be &s;eal'd with the Lord Pre&s;ident's Seal, when brought to the Council, and &s;o to remain till the Parliament
<PB N="69" REF="70">
&s;hould meet, and give Orders about them. They brought away two Trunks which the Earl told them contain'd what they came for. But it being &s;aid, there were more on Board a Ship come from <HI>Holland,</HI> and not then landed, Orders were i&s;&s;u'd to demand them al&s;o; but I do not hear they were found.</P>
<P>The 20th of <HI>January</HI> was appointed for a Day of General Thank&s;giving, for the peaceable Acce&s;&s;i|on of the King to the Throne, and the King and whole Court came in Proce&s;&s;ion to St. <HI>Paul's</HI> upon that Occa&s;ion; <HI>Te Deum</HI> was &s;ung to Mu&s;ick within, and clos'd with Guns fired from the <HI>Tower</HI> without; the Sermon was Preach'd by the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> and at Night God was thank'd again, as is our u&s;ual Cu&s;tom in <HI>England,</HI> with Bells, and Bonfires, Illuminations, &s;houting of Rabbles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>On the 17th of <HI>March</HI> the Parliament met, the King attended by the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> appear'd for the fir&s;t Time, in the Hou&s;e of Peers, and the Commons being &s;ent for up, were Order'd to re|turn, and choo&s;e a Speaker, and to pre&s;ent him to the King. On the 21&s;t, when they appear'd again, having cho&s;en <HI>Spencer Compton,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Speaker of their Hou&s;e, they Pre&s;ented him to the King, with the u&s;ual Ceremony; when the King having approv'd the Speaker, open'd the Se&s;&s;ion, with the following Speech, which was read by the Lord Chancellor.</P>
<Q><P>My Lords, and Gentlemen,</P>
<P><HI>THIS being the fir&s;t Opportunity that I have had of meeting my People in Parliament, &s;ince it plea&s;ed God, of his good Providence, to call me to the Throne of my Ance&s;tors, I mo&s;t gladly make u&s;e</HI>
<PB N="70" REF="71">
<HI>of it to thank my faithful and loving Subjects, for that Zeal and Firmne&s;s that hath been &s;hewn in Defence of the</HI> Prote&s;tant <HI>Succe&s;&s;ion, again&s;t all the open and &s;e|cret Practices that have been u&s;ed to defeat it: And I &s;hall never forget the Obligations I have to tho&s;e who have di&s;tingui&s;h'd them&s;elves upon this Occa&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It were to be wi&s;h'd, that the unparallell'd Succe&s;&s;es of a War, which was &s;o wi&s;ely and cheerfully &s;upported by this Nation, in order to procure a good Peace, had been attended with a &s;uitable Conclu&s;ion: But it is with Concern I mu&s;t tell you, that &s;ome Conditions, even of this Peace, e&s;&s;ential to the Security and Trade of</HI> Great Britain, <HI>are not yet duly executed; and the Performance of the whole may be look'd upon as precari|ous, until we &s;hall have formed defen&s;ive Alliances to Guaranty the pre&s;ent Treaties.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Pretender, <HI>who &s;till re&s;ides in</HI> Lorrain, <HI>threa|tens to di&s;turb Us, and boa&s;ts of the A&s;&s;i&s;tance, which he &s;till expects here, to repair his former Di&s;appoint|ments.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A great Part of our Trade is render'd impractica|ble: This, if not retriev'd, mu&s;t de&s;troy Our Manufac|tures, and ruin our Navigation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Publick Debts are very Great, and &s;urprizingly encrea&s;ed, even &s;ince the fatal Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms. My fir&s;t Care was to prevent the farther Increa&s;e of the&s;e Debts, by paying off forthwith a great Number of Ships, which had been kept in Pay, when there was no Occa&s;ion for continuing &s;uch an Expence.</HI></P></Q>
<Q><P>Gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Commons,</P>
<P><HI>I rely upon you for &s;uch Supplies as the pre&s;ent Cir|cum&s;tances of Our Affairs require for this Year's Ser|vice, and for the Support of the Publick Faith. The E&s;timates &s;hall be laid before you, that you may con&s;ider</HI>
<PB N="71" REF="72">
<HI>of them; and what you &s;hall judge nece&s;&s;ary for your Safety, I &s;hall think &s;ufficient for mine.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I doubt not but you will concur with me in Opinion, that nothing can contribute more to the Support of the Credit of the Nation, than a &s;trict ob&s;ervance of all Parliamentary Engagements.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Branches of the Revenue, formerly granted for the Support of the Civil Government, are &s;o far in|cumber'd and alienated, that the Produce of the Funds which remain, and have been granted to me, will fall much &s;hort of what was at fir&s;t de&s;ign'd for maintaining the Honour and Dignity of the Crown: And &s;ince it is my Happine&s;s (as I am confident you think it yours) to &s;ee a Prince of</HI> Wales, <HI>who may, in due Time, &s;uc|ceed me on the Throne, and to &s;ee him ble&s;s'd with ma|ny Children, the be&s;t and mo&s;t valuable Pledges of our Care and Concern for your Pro&s;perity; this mu&s;t Occa|&s;ion an Expence to which the Nation has not of many Years been accu&s;tom'd; but &s;uch as &s;urely no Man will grudge: And therefore I do not doubt but you will think of it with that Affection which I have Rea&s;on to hope from you.</HI></P></Q>
<Q><P>My Lords and Gentlemen,</P>
<P><HI>The Eyes of all</HI> Europe <HI>are upon you, waiting the I&s;&s;ue of this fir&s;t Se&s;&s;ion. Let no unhappy Divi&s;ions of Parties here at Home, divert you from pur&s;uing the Common Intere&s;t of your Country. Let no wicked In|&s;inuations di&s;quiet the Minds of my Subjects. The e&s;tabli&s;h'd Con&s;titution in Church and State &s;hall be the Rule of my Government; the Happine&s;s, Ea&s;e, and Pro&s;perity of my People, &s;hall be the chief Care of my Life. Tho&s;e who a&s;&s;i&s;t me in carrying on the&s;e Mea&s;ures, I &s;hall always e&s;teem my be&s;t Friends; and I doubt not but that I &s;hall be able, with your A&s;&s;i&s;tance, to di&s;appoint the De&s;igns of tho&s;e who would</HI>
<PB N="72" REF="73">
<HI>deprive me of that Ble&s;&s;ing, which I mo&s;t Value,</HI> The Affection of my People.</P></Q>
<P>The Addre&s;&s;es, and An&s;wers, u&s;ual on the&s;e Occa&s;ions, from, and to both Hou&s;es, are too long for this Place, nor at all needful, being per|fectly cu&s;tomary, and much the &s;ame, as happen every Se&s;&s;ion, <HI>mutatis mutandis</HI> as Circum&s;tances direct.</P>
<P>In the very fir&s;t Speech made in this Hou&s;e of Commons, the Mi&s;managements of the former Reign were fallen upon by a Per&s;on who has &s;ince had Occa&s;ion to &s;ee farther into the De&s;igns of Per&s;ons and the Conduct of Things, than at that Time his Pa&s;&s;ions would permit him to do; and the Wording their fir&s;t Addre&s;s introduc'd it into both Hou&s;es, where it &s;oon became familiar; for the warm Party carry'd this Point in every De|bate.</P>
<P>By this time al&s;o, the general Cry, without Doors as well as within, ran &s;o much upon the late Mi&s;|managements, and the farther Inquiry into the Conduct of the late Reign, grew &s;o Popular, and Con&s;equently &s;eem'd &s;o Nece&s;&s;ary, that it was ea&s;ie to &s;ee who they aim'd at.</P>
<P>The Lord <HI>Bolingbroke,</HI> late Secretary of State to the Queen, tho' he appear'd openly and &s;poke boldly, in the Hou&s;e of Lords, yet as he &s;aw there would be no re&s;i&s;ting a Torrent, and that the part he had in the Treaty, might very ea&s;ily be carry'd into what Con&s;tructions tho&s;e who had Numbers on their Side might direct, was advis'd by all his Friends, to keep him&s;elf out of their Hands, who, as if they were de&s;irous he &s;hould Fly, openly profe&s;s'd to aim at his Head.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="74">
He took their Advice accordingly, and with|drew the 26th, having before &s;ecured a Ve&s;&s;el to meet him at <HI>Dover,</HI> and carry him over to <HI>France,</HI> where accordingly he Landed the &s;ame Evening. It was &s;aid, he left behind him, written with his own Hand, the following Letter, directed in no Name, but written to a Friend.</P>

My Blood was to have been the Cement of a new Alliance; nor could my Innocence be any Security, after it had been once demanded from Abroad, and re&s;olv'd on at Home, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to cut me off.

<P>About this Time died three Leading Men indeed on the Court Side, one in the Church, and two in State; <HI>viz.</HI> Fir&s;t, Dr. <HI>Gilbert Burnet,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> who died the 17th of <HI>March; Thomas</HI> Earl of <HI>Wharton,</HI> who died the 12th of <HI>April;</HI> and <HI>Charles</HI> Earl of <HI>Halifax,</HI> fir&s;t Commi&s;&s;ioner of the Trea&s;ury, who died the 19th of <HI>May;</HI> this la&s;t, an honourable Mention has been made of for his Moderation; I cannot &s;ay, that the other were any way to be charg'd with that Sin.</P>
<P>The Parliament Affairs went on without any con&s;iderable Oppo&s;ition, the <HI>Land Tax,</HI> the <HI>Malt Tax,</HI> and a <HI>Bill for regulating the Forces,</HI> had alrea|dy receiv'd the Royal A&s;&s;ent; and the Hou&s;e &s;eem'd indeed, to be kept &s;itting, principally upon Account of the Party Affairs, mentioned be|fore.</P>
<P>In the Committee of <HI>Secrecy</HI> Matters run high, and they began to promi&s;e to make their Report ready very &s;peedily: On the 9th of <HI>June,</HI> the Chair-Man acquainted the Hou&s;e, that the Report was ready, but before they pre&s;ented it, the Committee thought fit to exert in &s;ome Particular manner, the Power of the Hou&s;e. <Q>&startq;It is true, they had Power in them&s;elves to &s;end for Per&s;ons as well as Papers, and Records, yet they thought it nece&s;&s;ary rather (to give their own Words) in order to bring Offenders to Ju&s;tice, that &s;ome
<PB N="78" REF="79">
Per&s;ons &s;hould be &s;ecur'd before 'twas po&s;&s;ible they &s;hould know what they were to be examin'd to; and le&s;t they &s;hould have Notice to make their E&s;cape: Then the Chair-man added, That he was commanded (according to former Precedents) to move, that a Warrant may be I&s;&s;ued by Mr. Speaker to apprehend certain Per&s;ons who &s;hall be named to him by the Chair-Man of the &s;aid Committee; and that no Members may be per|mitted to go out of the Hou&s;e. <HI>Hereupon it was</HI> Ordered, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That the Lobby be clear'd of all Strangers, the back Doors of the Speaker's Chamber lock'd up, the Key brought, and laid upon the Table. And that the Serjeant do &s;tand at the Door of the Hou&s;e, and &s;uffer no Mem|ber to go forth. <HI>Secondly,</HI> That Mr. <HI>Speaker</HI> do I&s;&s;ue his Warrant to the Serjeant, to take into his Cu&s;tody &s;uch Per&s;ons as &s;hall be named by the Chairman of the Committee of Secre&s;y, in order to their being examin'd before them.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>Hereupon Mr. <HI>Speaker</HI> i&s;&s;ued his Warrants, to take into Cu&s;tody &s;everal Per&s;ons that were named by Mr <HI>Walpole,</HI> particularly Mr. <HI>Matthew Prior,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Thomas Harley,</HI> the fir&s;t of whom was im|mediately apprehended, and the other &s;ome Hours after.</P>
<P>Then Mr. <HI>Walpole</HI> acquainted the Hou&s;e, <Q>&startq;That the Committee of Secrecy had peru&s;ed the Books and Papers referr'd to them, and had agreed upon a Report, which they had commanded him to make: That it was contain'd in two Books, one of which was the Report, and the other an Appendix to it, which contain'd at large tho&s;e Letters and Papers which were referr'd to in the Report.&endq;</Q> He read the Report, and deliver'd it in at the Table, with the Appendix, and the
<PB N="79" REF="80">
Books which were referr'd to the &s;aid Committee. The reading of the Report having taken up from One 'till about Six in the Afternoon, a Motion was made by the Friends of the <HI>late Mini&s;try,</HI> and the Que&s;tion put, That the further Con&s;ideration of it be adjourn'd 'till the next Morning, it was carry'd in the Negative, by 282 Votes, to 171; and or|der'd, that <HI>the Report be now read:</HI> Upon which the Clerk of the Hou&s;e having read 'till half an Hour pa&s;t Eight, the further Con&s;ideration of it was adjourn'd 'till the next Morning.</P>
<P>The apprehending Mr. <HI>Prior,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Harley,</HI> being thus done, with &s;o much Ceremony, and the Report read, which contain'd &s;o many Sheets, that it was &s;aid to be eight Hours in Reading them, as above, and the Hou&s;e could not go through it that Night; the next Day it was fini&s;h'd, and read a &s;econd Time, and order'd to be Printed; which has been done ac|cordingly, and therefore need not to be repeated in this Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the &s;econd Reading was over, the Grand Affair began, for the Chairman &s;tood up, and Impeach'd the Lord Vi&s;count <HI>Bolingbroke</HI> of high Trea&s;on, and high Crimes and Mi&s;deme|nors: after which, the Lord <HI>Coningsby,</HI> as it had been concerted, Impeach'd the Earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> ma|king &s;ome Flouri&s;hes to introduce it.</P>
<P>It is remarkable here, that even at the Time this Impeachment was brought in, a certain Mem|ber, not only of the Hou&s;e, but of the Secret Com|mittee al&s;o, was &s;aid to acknowledge the Defici|ency of the Charge, in the Terms following, or to that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="81">
<HI>That as to the Lord</HI> Bolingbroke, <HI>They had more than &s;ufficient Evidence to convict him of high Trea&s;on, upon the Statute</HI> 25 Edw. III. <HI>But that as to the Earl of</HI> Oxford, <HI>he doubted whether they had either &s;ufficient Matter, or Evidence to Impeach him of Trea&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>But the Re&s;olution was neverthele&s;s pa&s;s'd, not|with&s;tanding &s;o ingenious an Acknowledgment, and &s;o the Earl was al&s;o Impeach'd. A certain Gentleman, &s;aying, that they had other Evidence, and other Facts, which, however, never yet appear'd, and if it had, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erv'd that it did not appear then, and yet, that the Re&s;olu|tion for the Impeachment pa&s;s'd without Divid|ing.</P>
<P>The&s;e Evidences we have of the Warmth with which things were carry'd on at that Time, of which I &s;hall &s;ay no more, 'till I come to the I&s;&s;ue of the Impeachment it &s;elf.</P>
<P>Upon the Voting the&s;e Impeachments, the Hou&s;e order'd the Committee of Secrecy to draw up Articles, and prepare Evidence, as u&s;ual in &s;uch Ca&s;es, and then adjourn'd their farther pro&s;ecuting that Part for a Week.</P>
<P>But Time had no Influence yet to cool their Vigour in the&s;e Proceedings, or at lea&s;t, the In|tervals being too &s;hort for &s;uch an Effect, the Time which was taken, rather &s;erv'd to Fer|ment them to a greater Degree; for the next Days were taken up in the farther Pur&s;uit of the &s;ame Point. And on the 19th the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> was Impeach'd of high Trea&s;on. Al&s;o the next Day the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> was Impeach'd of high Crimes and Mi&s;demeanors.</P>
<P>Here they thought fit to make a Stop; there was a great Struggle to have &s;aved the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> from this Blow. But it was in vain. Not
<PB N="81" REF="82">
the pa&s;t Sufferings of his Family for the Mo|narchy; not his &s;teady Adherance to the Church; not his long Services in the Field; not his excellent Conduct at <HI>Vigo:</HI> No pa&s;t Merit could Weigh again&s;t the publick Re&s;entment, or ward the fatal Blow off from him, which very unhappily precipi|tated him into Mea&s;ures which have &s;ince fini&s;h'd his Ruin; and which, whatever others may think, I never &s;aw Cau&s;e to believe he had entertain'd the lea&s;t Thought of before.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be acknowledg'd here al&s;o, that the ill tim'd indi&s;creet Affection of the Common People to the Duke, had too much Share in his Fall; For the Mobbs and Rabbles, of which mention has been made, and which even the wi&s;e&s;t Men among tho&s;e who were again&s;t the Mea&s;ures of the pre|&s;ent Admini&s;tration did not approve of, were in|excu&s;ably to Blame, in making u&s;e of the Duke's Name, as the Characteri&s;tick to the Party; crying in the Street, <HI>Ormond, Ormond,</HI> for ever! In Op|po&s;ition to the Cry of the <HI>Whiggi&s;h</HI> Mobbs, of King GEORGE, forever!</P>
<P>This &s;etting the Duke's Name in a direct Op|po&s;ition to the King's, tho' no Man could ever &s;ay he con&s;ented to, or approv'd of it, did him a manife&s;t Injury, and had, I believe, too great a Share in his Misfortunes. However, let that be as it will, the Duke's unhappy Conduct <HI>&s;ince</HI> has too much ju&s;tified all the Mea&s;ures of his Ene|mies, and entirely ruined him and his Family. and not one Word can be &s;aid, but what Pity extorts, for the Lo&s;s of &s;ome of the Fine&s;t and Greate&s;t PERSONAGES among&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nobility.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="83">
The Duke finding it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to &s;tem this Current, and that he could not expect any Favour when Things run thus high, withdrew al|&s;o, and conveyed him&s;elf over to <HI>France,</HI> as the Lord <HI>Bolingbroke</HI> had done before.</P>
<P>As Things were thus warm in the Hou&s;e, &s;o the Tumults, of which I have made mention be|fore, encrea&s;ed to that height, in the <HI>Northern</HI> Parts e&s;pecially, that they wanted little of an open Re|bellion: And indeed, had the Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> with any Number of Troops from Abroad, land|ed in the Interim, as it was given out he would, it would certainly have been a Rebellion at that time: But they were utterly di&s;titute of Support from Abroad. And it mu&s;t be acknowledged, to the exqui&s;ite Management of the King, that by his Influence and Intelligence Abroad, all the At|tempts made in any part of the World, to get A&s;|&s;i&s;tance, Ships, Men or Money, were effectually di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>The&s;e Tumults, however, made the Nation ve|ry unea&s;y; even tho&s;e who were as male-contented as any body, with the pre&s;ent Mea&s;ures, yet trembled at the Rage of the Rabble; knowing well that an enflam'd Multitude di&s;tingui&s;h not Friends from Enemies. None but &s;uch who&s;e Circum&s;tan|ces were de&s;perate, or Principles directly Jaco|bite, could be plea&s;ed with the confu&s;ed Circum|&s;tances which the Nation &s;eemed to be in upon that Occa&s;ion; Every body el&s;e dreaded the Con|&s;equences: However, as the Parliament was &s;itting, Relief was expected from them; and accordingly Information being given of &s;ome of tho&s;e Riots ju&s;t then happening in <HI>Stafford&s;hire,</HI> where they were carried on to an Extravagance &s;carce credi|ble, the Hou&s;e took it into their Con&s;ideration,
<PB N="83" REF="84">
and Addre&s;s'd the King, that the Magi&s;trates, Ju|&s;tices of the Peace, and others, &s;hould be encou|raged to do their Duty in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing Tumults; that tho&s;e who fail'd in their Duty might be pu|ni&s;hed; and that an Account of the Damages &s;uf|fered by any of his Maje&s;ty's Subjects &s;hould be brought in, and the Lo&s;s made good to them by the Publick. This was a great Encouragement to the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in particular, who had &s;uffered in|deed deeply in the Demoli&s;hing of their Meeting-Hou&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by the Mobs; and who in Virtue of this Re&s;olution received, &s;ome time after, very ample Satisfaction in Money for the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Upon this Occa&s;ion al&s;o, that well-known Law was pa&s;s'd by the Hou&s;e of Lords fir&s;t, and after|wards by the Commons, Entituled, <HI>An Act for preventing Tumults,</HI> &amp;c. and which is &s;till in Force; whereby the County or Hundred is made an&s;wer|able for the Damages committed by the Rabble; and the Rioters who &s;hall continue together after Reading to them certain Words expre&s;s'd in the Act, are guilty of Felony; upon which very Act, &s;everal Per&s;ons have been &s;ince Executed; as par|ticularly 2 in <HI>Worce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> and Five in <HI>Fleet&s;treet, London.</HI></P>
<P>But Things were by all the&s;e degrees only ri|pening up for wor&s;e; for on the 20th of <HI>July,</HI> the &s;ame Day that the King came to the Hou&s;e to pa&s;s the abovemention'd Act for Preventing Tumults, his Maje&s;ty gave them an Account that he had certain Advice that the Pretender from Abroad, and a Party at Home, were preparing for an At|tempt again&s;t the Government. This Speech o|pened the fir&s;t real View to the Nation of the ap|proaching Rebellion, and is as follows:</P>
<Q><PB N="84" REF="85">
<P>My Lords and Gentlemen,</P>
<P><HI>THE Zeal you have &s;hewn for pre&s;erving the Peace of my Kingdoms, and your Wi&s;dom in providing &s;o good a Law to prevent all riotons and tumultuous Proceedings, give me great Satisfaction; but I am &s;orry to find that &s;uch a Spirit of Rebellion has di&s;cover|ed it &s;elf as leaves no Room to doubt but the&s;e Di&s;orders are &s;et on Foot and encouraged by Per&s;ons di&s;affected to my Government, in Expectation of being &s;upported from Abroad.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Pre&s;ervation of our excellent Con&s;titution, and the Security of our holy Religion, has been, and always &s;hall be, my chief Care; and I cannot que&s;tion but your Concern for the&s;e invaluable Ble&s;&s;ings is &s;o great, as not to let them be expo&s;ed to &s;uch Attempts as I have certain Advices are preparing by the Pretender from abroad, and carrying on at home by a re&s;tle&s;s Party in his Favour.</HI></P></Q>
<Q><P>Gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Commons,</P>
<P><HI>In the&s;e Circum&s;tances, I think it proper to ask your A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and make no doubt but you will &s;o far con&s;ult your own Security, as not to leave the Nation, under a Rebellion actually begun at home, and threatned with an Inva&s;ion from abroad, in a defencele&s;s Condition. And I &s;hall look upon the Provi&s;ion you &s;hall make for the Safety of my People, as the be&s;t Mark of your Affe|ction to me.</HI></P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Commons, upon this &s;urprizing News, Voted, as they could indeed do no le&s;s, an Humble Addre&s;s to Thank his Maje&s;ty for com|municating to them, <HI>the Advices he has received of an Attempt preparing to be made upon the Nation from abroad, aletted and encouraged by trea&s;onable Practices</HI>
<PB N="85" REF="86">
<HI>at home, in favour of a Popi&s;h Pretender; and to a&s;&s;ure his Maje&s;ty, that this Hou&s;e will, with their Lives and Fortunes, stand by and &s;upport his Maje&s;ty again&s;t all his open and &s;ecret Enemies; and to de&s;ire his Maje&s;ty, that he will immediately give Directions for fitting out &s;uch a Number of Ships as may effectually guard the Coa&s;ts, and to i&s;&s;ue out Commi&s;&s;ions for augmenting his Forces by Land; a&s;&s;uring his Maje&s;ty, this Hou&s;e will, without Lo&s;s of Time, effectually enable him to rai&s;e and maintain &s;uch a Number of Forces, both by Sea and Land, as &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary for the Defence of his &s;acred Per&s;on, and for the Security of his Kingdoms.</HI></P></Q>
<P>The Lords al&s;o pre&s;ented an Addre&s;s to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>To back tho&s;e Addre&s;&s;es with &s;uitable Supplies, they immediately Voted Money for the rai&s;ing Three Thou&s;and Dragoons, and Four Thou&s;and Foot, be&s;ides Four Companies of Foot to be ad|ded to the Cold&s;tream Regiment, call'd the Second Regiment of Foot Guards, to make it up Two Batallions.</P>
<P>But this was not all; for the Hou&s;e, zealous for the Publick Safety, in &s;o critical a Time, went immediately upon an Act, which nothing but the imminent Danger of a Rebellion could have pre|vail'd upon them to have pa&s;s'd; I mean, an Act to &s;u&s;pend the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> Act for a certain Time, by Empowering the King to &s;ecure and detain &s;uch Per&s;ons as his Maje&s;ty &s;hall &s;u&s;pect are Con&s;piring again&s;t his Per&s;on and Govern|ment.</P>
<P>This Act has &s;o much in it, that may be Matter of Precedent in like Ca&s;es, and was &s;o much ob|jected again&s;t, that I cannot omit, at lea&s;t &s;ome part of it; in particular, that which relates to the Impri&s;oning of the Subject: The latter part,

<P>On the 23d of <HI>July</HI> the King gave the Royal A&s;&s;ent to this Bill, and at the &s;ame Time a Bill was brought in for the farther Security of the King's Per&s;on, and the Hou&s;e then proceeded to addre&s;s the King to take all the Half-pay Officers into whole Pay for a Year, lea&s;t the Army &s;hould not be &s;ufficient, and to a&s;&s;ure the King that the Hou&s;e of Commons would &s;upply the Extraordi|nary

<P>_AS was expre&s;s'd in the Clo&s;e of the la&s;t Year, the Second Year of the King was a Year of Victory and Triumph; that is, it Ended in Triumph.</P>
<P>But alas! What Triumph, what Joy has a Father of a Family in the Ruin of the mo&s;t Di&s;obedient of his Children? What Triumph can a King, who is, or &s;hould be, a Father of his Country, make over his ruin'd, tho' rebellious, Subjects? Small Joy can be conceived, to a Mer|ciful Prince, in the De&s;truction of his own People, who&s;e Blood is the Strength of the Body Politick, and who&s;e Sorrows and Sufferings mu&s;t needs (&s;ympathetically &s;peaking) be his own.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="91">
However, Rebellion mu&s;t be re&s;i&s;ted; and be they Political Children or Natural Children, 'tis all one, the Di&s;obedient mu&s;t be reduced, and that even at their own Expence, if it can be done no other way.</P>
<P>This remarkable Year begins &s;o evidently with the Beginning of the Publick Di&s;tractions, that this part of our fir&s;t Volume will be of Cour&s;e a Hi&s;to|ry of the Rebellion; and tho' I &s;hall be obliged to treat the&s;e Subjects in a more conci&s;e manner than ordinary, being obliged to bring the Hi&s;tory of Four Years into the Compa&s;s of One, yet I pro|mi&s;e my &s;elf it &s;hall be a more Compleat Hi&s;tory of the Rebellion than any that has yet been be|&s;tow'd upon this Age.</P>
<P>The Beginning of this Second Year of the King, I &s;ay, has a different A&s;pect from the Fir&s;t: At his fir&s;t Acce&s;&s;ion the whole People, as one Man, &s;eem'd to be with him; all concurr'd with the Succe&s;&s;ion of King <HI>GEORGE;</HI> and &s;o forward to make their Court, that many who thought them&s;elves a little weak in Intere&s;t, &s;crupled not to make that Court at the Expence of one ano|ther.</P>
<P>But now the Court had, as I may &s;ay, a fiery Tryal to go through, and a New Part to act: Every Day brought in Accounts of Tumults, Ri|ots, Breaches of the Peace, and open Preparati|ons for War, as well Abroad as at Home, till at length it broke out into open Rebellion, Battle and Blood&s;hed.</P>
<P>The Parliament having, as I have &s;aid, given the King A&s;&s;urances of their readine&s;s to Support his Intere&s;t again&s;t all his Enemies at Home or Abroad, gave a full Demon&s;tration of it in pa&s;|&s;ing that Eminent Act, which I ju&s;t now na|med,
<PB N="91" REF="92">
for empowering the King to &s;ecure and detain &s;uch Per&s;ons as &s;hould be &s;u&s;pected to be con&s;piring again&s;t his Per&s;on and Government: This Act, in a word, put the Liberty of every <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Subject ab&s;olutely into the King's Power, for Six Months; and in Virtue of this Act, abun|dance of Su&s;pected Per&s;ons were taken into Cu|&s;tody, whereof &s;ome lay a great while in Pri|&s;on.</P>
<P>This was the <HI>happy Severity,</HI> which, as was ta|ken Notice of afterwards by the Lord Chancellor, prevented &s;ome Gentlemen from falling into the Mi&s;ery which it was probable would have been the Con&s;equence of their Liberty, if they had join'd in the Rebellion, as it was very likely &s;ome of them would have done.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e having &s;ettled this Point, in the next place Voted Supplies for the Troops, which by a former Vote they had con&s;ented to have rais'd.</P>
<P>The Government was now Intent upon their Warlike Preparations, and the King applied him&s;elf with a peculiar Vigor, to put him&s;elf in a Po&s;ture to meet the Dangers which threatned him. Sir <HI>George Byng</HI> was appointed to Command the Squadron of Ships which were ordered to be fitted out on this Occa&s;ion, and their Rendezvous was order'd to be in the <HI>Downs,</HI> that they might be ready as Occa&s;ion might require; for it was not known yet where the impending Cloud would break.</P>
<P>General <HI>Erle</HI> was order'd to <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> where he was Governor, and a Detachment of Troops were &s;ent to Reinforce the Garri&s;on, there having been &s;ome Rumours of De&s;igns to Surprize that Fortre&s;s: A Camp having been appointed in <HI>Hyde-Park,</HI> the Regiments of Guards, as well Hor&s;e
<PB N="92" REF="93">
as Foot, Encamp'd there; and this it was &s;aid, was done as well to &s;ecure the Fidelity of the Soldiers, as to have them ready at hand for any Service as Occa&s;ion might require. It was &s;aid this Camp was to be made up to Ten Thou&s;and Men; but the other Troops had Employment found them farther off.</P>
<P>The Train'd Bands of the City, and the Mili|tia of &s;everal Counties, were ordered to be ready in order to &s;uppre&s;s Tumults, the chief Thing perhaps which they were Serviceable for. And the King &s;ent an Order to the Lord-Mayor, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to take care of the Publick Peace.</P>
<P>The Country Towns and Corporations, led on by the Bi&s;hop and Clergy of <HI>London,</HI> then by the City of <HI>London, (viz.)</HI> the Lord-Mayor, Alder|men and Common Council, crowded up to Court with their Addre&s;&s;es, wherein, even Prodigal of Words, (which co&s;t little) they lay'd Life and Fortune at his Maje&s;ty's Feet in a mo&s;t extraor|dinary manner: And if the Loyalty was to be Calculated by the Appearance of, and Language in the Addre&s;&s;es, all Things were out of Danger on the King's Side.</P>
<P>I hope it will be concluded, that I am not &s;o empty of Matter as to take up any of the&s;e Sheets in repeating tho&s;e Unmeaning things call'd Ad|dre&s;&s;es, or the Cu&s;tomary An&s;wers given to them; 'tis enough to &s;ay, they were Generally receiv'd very well, and an&s;wer'd in the mo&s;t obliging Terms.</P>
<P>The Univer&s;ity of <HI>Oxford</HI> had the Misfortune to be the only Body who&s;e Addre&s;s was not receiv'd: But it &s;eems &s;ome of the Univer&s;ities back Friends were plea&s;ed to repre&s;ent them &s;o, as that
<PB N="93" REF="94">
they had &s;ome Intimation that their Addre&s;s would not be acceptable; &s;o it was not pre&s;ented at all.</P>
<P>The Vigor of the&s;e Proceedings gave Credit to the Publick Affairs, and was partly the Rea&s;on why the Court of <HI>France</HI> did not care to meddle, nor to appear, at lea&s;t in a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Party; nay, &s;o Pu&s;illanimous &s;ome Great People abroad ap|peared, that the Regent of <HI>France</HI> perfectly aban|don'd the Pretender, and neither gave him any A&s;&s;i&s;tance, or &s;o much as protected tho&s;e who &s;ol|licited his Affairs.</P>
<P>The Parliament in the mean time, to make them&s;elves Terrible to the Party, began to pu&s;h on their Judicial Proceedings. The Secret Com|mittee fell to work with their Impeachments, and particularly, they exhibited 5 new Articles again&s;t the Earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> and &s;eem'd to breath out the Extream of Re&s;entment again&s;t that noble Per|&s;on, who had now, with an inimitable Courage, put him&s;elf into their Hands, and was actually a Pri&s;oner in the Tower. The&s;e Articles were &s;aid to be tho&s;e which &s;ome Per&s;ons had re&s;erv'd in Petto again&s;t the Earl, and which were to &s;ecure his Pro&s;ecution; but they were all too &s;hort in their aim at this Great Man, who, we have &s;ince &s;een, by a wonderful Turn of Providence, fully deliver'd out of the Hands of all his Enemies, Whether by the Folly of his Oppo&s;ers, or the Strength of his own Merit and Innocence, the Se|quel may make appear at large. The&s;e particular Articles, however, were thought of Moment, and therefore I take this Notice of them by way of ab&s;tract. It &s;eems it was the affair of the unfor|tunate Expedition to <HI>Canada,</HI> that brought the&s;e farther Enquiries upon the Stage; which &s;eeing
<PB N="94" REF="95">
they appear'd to be under the Earl's Direction, they were willing to lay as much of them to his Charge as they thought might belong to him, though the Articles made no mention of that Af|fair neither. The Sub&s;tance of the&s;e Articles was as follows:</P>
<P N="1">1. That he had mi&s;applied 12000 <HI>l.</HI> which was receiv'd on the Earl's Account, by a Warrant from the Queen, obtain'd to one <HI>John Drum|mond,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></P>
<P N="2">2. That he had &s;ent abroad Agents of his own, without the Communication of the Allies, to &s;et on foot &s;eparate and dangerous Negotiati|ons, giving them unlimited Credit to draw Bills on him as Trea&s;urer, and had in that manner paid 17920 <HI>l.</HI> to Mr. <HI>Prior</HI> and Mr. <HI>Harley,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">3. That he advi&s;ed the paying 47000 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> to the Queen Dowager.</P>
<P N="4">4. That he advi&s;ed the receiving Sir <HI>Patrick Lawle&s;s</HI> as a Mini&s;ter from the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and did negotiate with him the mo&s;t Important Affairs, notwith&s;tanding he was a Subject of the Crown, and under the guilt of High Trea&s;on, coun|tenancing thereby the Emi&s;&s;aries of the Preten|der.</P>
<P N="5">5. That he had advi&s;ed her Maje&s;ty to abandon the <HI>Catalans;</HI> at the &s;ame time amu&s;ing them with Hopes of Care being taken of their Inte|re&s;ts, and treating with the King of <HI>Spain</HI> with|out making any Provi&s;ion for them.</P>
<P>This Month the King came twice to the Hou&s;e in le&s;s than Twenty days, to pa&s;s Bills, occa&s;ion|ed principally by the weight and import of the Bills which were prepared, and the unu&s;ual Expe|dition
<PB N="95" REF="96">
which the Hou&s;e made in pa&s;&s;ing them: The particular Things I refer to in this, were, the Im|peachment of the Earl of <HI>Bolingbroke,</HI> and of the Duke of <HI>Ormond;</HI> which having not been effectu|al, by rea&s;on of their being withdrawn from the Storm which they &s;aw falling, were follow'd with &s;pecial Acts of Attainder upon them both.</P>
<P>It was for &s;ome time hoped the Duke, at lea&s;t, would have been excu&s;ed, having a great &s;tock of Merit for former Services to plead in his Favour; but it would not over-ballance the Charge now brought again&s;t him: And his Impeachment be|ing fir&s;t carried in the Hou&s;e of Commons by&mdash;Voices, he fled, as is &s;aid above, and the Attainder was a thing in cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Some have &s;aid, that his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf had a mind to have Excu&s;ed the Duke of <HI>Ormond;</HI> but as the Hou&s;e of Commons &s;eemed very much en|clin'd to pu&s;h the Pro&s;ecution of the&s;e Things without any Re&s;pect of Per&s;ons, it was not thought convenient to Interpo&s;e: So the Duke was left to his Fate.</P>
<P>The Articles of Impeachment again&s;t them both, as they are too long for this Tract, &s;o be|ing publickly Printed on &s;o many &s;everal Occa&s;i|ons, it would be needle&s;s to take up any of the Room in this Work. As to the Acts of Attain|der, they are upon Record, and being Things of cour&s;e, it is enough to &s;ay they were attaint|ed.</P>
<P>The &s;everal Acts pa&s;s'd on the&s;e Occa&s;ions, were as follows:</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>An Act for the better preventing Mutiny and De&s;er|tion.</HI></ITEM>

</LIST>
<P>All this while the Government were not Idle; indeed it could not be &s;uppo&s;ed that any Govern|ment could be Idle in the Circum&s;tances they were in; for every Po&s;t brought repeated Accounts of the Di&s;affection of the People, and of the for|wardne&s;s of the Pretender's Friends, as well a|broad as at home. As, therefore, they were a|larm'd every Day with the approaches of Mi&s;chief, &s;o they &s;par'd no Pains to let their Enemies &s;ee they would be &s;oon in a Po&s;ture to receive them, and to give them occa&s;ion to repent any ra&s;h At|tempt they might make; and thus I am brought even to the Beginning of the Rebellion.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Publick Thing done, which throughly convinc'd us that the Government had &s;ome In|&s;ight
<PB N="97" REF="98">
into what was contriving again&s;t them, was, That as the King had formerly notified to the <HI>States General</HI> the ju&s;t Rea&s;ons he had to believe De&s;igns were forming to di&s;turb the Publick Peace, and to intimate that his Maje&s;ty expected their A&s;&s;i&s;tance in the Terms of the &s;everal Treaties at that time &s;ub&s;i&s;ting <HI>(viz.)</HI> that they would &s;end over 6000 Men to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance; &s;o now his Ma|je&s;ty re&s;olved to demand the &s;aid 6000 Men.</P>
<P>Nor was this a fruitle&s;s Demand, for the <HI>Dutch</HI> readily and cheerfully granted it, and &s;ent back word immediately to his Maje&s;ty, that they &s;hould be ready at his Service, whenever his Occa&s;ions requir'd them.</P>
<P>As the King was thus gathering together a Force to ward off the Blow when it came, &s;o his Servants and Mini&s;try were bu&s;y in diving &s;ecretly into the mo&s;t retir'd Combinations and Cabinets of his E|nemies, that if po&s;&s;ible by alarming them at fir&s;t, their Mea&s;ures might be di&s;concerted, and they might be Di&s;abled from the Undertaking it &s;elf.</P>
<P>In this, they were &s;o Vigilant, and withal &s;o Fortunate, that had they but &s;truck one Blow more, and &s;ecured one Man more, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> it has been thought by many, the Rebel|lion had not been undertaken at all; or at lea&s;t, had not been undertaken at that time.</P>
<P>And on the other hand, had not the Mea&s;ures which the Mini&s;try took, been thus vigorous and timely, it was very probable that the Rebellion which follow'd had not been &s;o Cheap a purcha&s;e to the Conqueror: And though it &s;eems hardly probable, that they could have prevailed effectual|ly to have &s;et the <HI>Pretender</HI> actually upon the Throne; yet it was more than probable, that
<PB N="98" REF="99">
they would have made this Nation the Seat of a long and bloody War, in which the Country mu&s;t have been too much a Prey to the Foreign Troops, who, perhaps, on both Sides would have come over as Auxiliaries to their re&s;pective Parties.</P>
<P>In order to the&s;e Di&s;coveries, the vigilant Mi|ni&s;try were not wanting of either Secret Agents at home, or Intelligence from abroad; by which they fail'd not to know what was doing in every Place. All the Mea&s;ures the <HI>Pretender</HI> took a|broad to get Arms and Ammunition, to engage Officers, and obtain Troops; to hire Ships, and load Nece&s;&s;aries, were every where Detected, Counter-acted, and Di&s;appointed; Ships procur'd in <HI>France</HI> were di&s;covered, and by the Regent, who began to act a New Part, (not often heard of in <HI>France)</HI> forbidden to &s;tir; Ships hir'd, Arms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> bought in <HI>Holland, Hamburgh,</HI> and other Parts, &s;top'd, and the Per&s;ons obliged to &s;cour off, and make the be&s;t of their way, for fear of being apprehended: So that in a Word, the <HI>Pre|tender</HI> had not a Port where he could openly make any Preparations, or where either him&s;elf or any of his Friends could Embark, other than Incogni|to, and with the greate&s;t Privacy: And this is the rea&s;on why, (if it were true, <HI>as the E. of</HI> Mar <HI>him|&s;elf declared in Print)</HI> that all that was done, was purely brought to pa&s;s by the Zeal and Ardour of tho&s;e who engag'd on this &s;ide; not one Ship with Arms, or Ammunition, or Money, arriving from any of their Friends abroad to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, all the while they were in Arms.</P>
<P>It is true, we were told otherwi&s;e; and it was certain, that &s;everal Ve&s;&s;els did arrive, tho' we knew not what they brought; but it &s;eems, tho' we were told much of the great Quantities of Arms, Cannon,
<PB N="99" REF="100">
Powder, Ball, Money, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which they brought over with them; yet, according to the Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> it mu&s;t be all a Mi&s;take.</P>
<P>But to return to the Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> and with him to the beginning of the Year; for it is ob&s;erved, that the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> having taken his Mea&s;ures before, entered upon his fatal Undertaking the very Fir&s;t of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> the Day Twelve Month of the King's Acce&s;&s;ion. It is reported, how true I know not, that he went from the very Court, where there was a Ball, and great Appearance of the Nobility and Gentry, on the Occa&s;ion; that he made his Complement, and from that Hour commenc'd the Rebellion, going that very Even|ing down the River, having received his Com|mi&s;&s;ion from the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and &s;ail'd directly for <HI>Scotland,</HI> where he &s;et up the Standard of his Ma|&s;ter, as he then call'd the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and proclaim|ed him King.</P>
<P>Here it is &s;aid again, that the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> would gladly have fallen in with the Government, had the Mini&s;try here, either known his Inclinati|ons &s;o much, or thought him &s;o con&s;iderable as to have believ'd it worth while to have received him: And perhaps it might have been &s;o far worth their while to have, by that Means, kept his Hands out of a Work which brought &s;o much lo&s;s of Trea|&s;ure and Blood upon the Nation.</P>
<P>I do not &s;ay, as &s;ome have &s;ugge&s;ted, that they &s;aw it, and thought it not worth their while; for certainly had they not thought it worth while to have prevented the Rebellion by entertaining him in the Service, they would have thought it worth while to have done it by detaining him in Cu&s;tody: And for this Rea&s;on, I rather believe the Government had no Notion of his Re&s;oluti|on,
<PB N="100" REF="101">
much le&s;s any Intimation or Intelligence of his De&s;ign: Neither do I find any thing of his De&s;ign laid &s;o deep as &s;ome have publi&s;hed, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That he had Concerted the &s;everal Ri&s;ings which were afterwards &s;poken of; or that he had re|ceived a Remittance of 100000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling from <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>For, in the whole Management of his Under|taking, it appeared, there was a manife&s;t Defici|ency of Money, till he found means to levy Con|tributions in the Country, and intercept &s;ome of the Publick Money; and that he had by no means, any &s;uch Encouragement, in the whole, as an Hun|dred Thou&s;and Pounds Sterling would have been to his Undertaking.</P>
<P>But to go back to his particular Proceedings, He embark'd the next Morning, having with him only Lieutenant General <HI>Hamilton,</HI> and two Gen|tlemen more. They landed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> on the North Shore of the Firth of Forth, at a little Sea|port call'd <HI>Creil,</HI> from whence pa&s;&s;ing by Land to the Bank of Tay, they came to <HI>Dundee,</HI> where being a little more Ma&s;ter of his own Safety, he had &s;ome Conference with his Friends; but made little &s;tay, making his way into the County call'd by his own Name, or rather from whence he takes his Title, <HI>(viz.)</HI> The County of <HI>Mar.</HI></P>
<P>Being arriv'd at <HI>Killdrummy,</HI> a Seat of his own, he &s;ends private Summons, or Invitations, to &s;uch of his Va&s;&s;als as he thought convenient, and to &s;everal Gentlemen in the Counties adjacent, who he knew were in the &s;ame Intere&s;t, to meet him at a Great Council, as they call'd it, to be held the 16th.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="102">
The A&s;&s;embly was indeed very Great, and, if my Account is Right, was much greater than any of our Accounts repre&s;ented it to be: Here in par|ticular a&s;&s;embled the Marquis of <HI>Huntley,</HI> Elde&s;t Son to the Duke of <HI>Gordon;</HI> the Marquis of <HI>Tul|libardin,</HI> Elde&s;t Son to the Duke of <HI>Athol;</HI> the Earl of <HI>Nith&s;dale,</HI> the &s;ame who afterwards made his E&s;cape out of the Tower of <HI>London;</HI> the Earls of <HI>Mari&s;chal, Traquhair, Errol, Southesk, Carnwarth, Seaforth, Lithgow,</HI> and &s;everal others, with the Vi&s;counts <HI>Kil&s;yth, Kenmure, King&s;ton,</HI> and <HI>Stor|mount,</HI> and the Lords <HI>Rollo, Duffus,</HI> and <HI>Drum|mond,</HI> and about Twenty-&s;ix Gentlemen of Intere&s;t in the <HI>Highlands,</HI> who&s;e Names we have not had Opportunity to get a Li&s;t of: Among whom were, in particular, the Two Generals <HI>Hamilton</HI> and <HI>Gordon; Glengary, Glenderule, Auchterhou&s;e, Drummond, Don Donald,</HI> and others, from the <HI>Clans.</HI></P>
<P>Many People have pretended to give us a for|mal Copy of the Earl's Speech to this A&s;&s;embly; but I &s;ee nothing authentick enough of that kind to be depended upon; the be&s;t Ab&s;tract which I have met with, of what pa&s;s'd, is as follows, <HI>(viz.)</HI></P>
<P>That here the Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> in a &s;et Speech, excited them all to take up Arms for King <HI>James</HI> VIII. as he then called the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and let them know what part he re&s;olved to take with them; <HI>(viz.)</HI> That he re&s;olved to &s;et up the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s Standard, and to Summon all the fencible Men of his own Tenants, and with them to hazard his Life in the Cau&s;e. He encouraged them likewi&s;e by giving them a&s;&s;urances, 1. That there would be a General Ri&s;ing in <HI>England</HI> upon the &s;ame Foot, and perhaps nam'd the particular Places and Per|&s;ons who really intended, tho' afterwards di&s;ap|pointed,
<PB N="102" REF="103">
to have been Rai&s;ed. 2. That they &s;hould certainly have powerful A&s;&s;i&s;tance from <HI>France,</HI> and from other Parts whence their King, as he call'd him, had already had large Supplies, and Promi&s;es of more. 3. That he &s;hewed them the Letters he had received from <HI>Lorrain,</HI> under the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s own Hand, promi&s;ing to come o|ver to them in Per&s;on, and put him&s;elf upon the Valour and Fidelity of his <HI>Scots</HI> Subjects, and that in the mean Time they &s;hould be &s;ure of Ships, with Arms, Ammunition, and all Military Stores, come to them; with Officers, Engineers, and Voluntiers, as &s;oon as they could give him an Account to what Port they would direct them to be &s;ent. 4. Shew'd them his Commi&s;&s;ion under the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s own Hand, nominating him Lieu|tenant General, Commander in Chief, and Di|rector of the War. And la&s;tly, He a&s;&s;ur'd them that he was furni&s;h'd with Money, and &s;hould from Time to Time be &s;upplied with &s;ufficient Sums to levy Men, and regularly to pay the Troops that &s;hould be rai&s;ed: So that no Gentlemen &s;hould be at any Expence to &s;ub&s;i&s;t his Men; but that both they and the Country &s;hould be ea&s;ed of all Burdens of that kind.</P>
<P>If all the&s;e Things were repre&s;ented to them, in a manner &s;uitable to the Occa&s;ion, as we have good A&s;&s;urances they were, we may the le&s;s wonder that &s;o many Gentlemen were impo&s;ed upon, and drawn into this In&s;urrection, which, perhaps, would otherwi&s;e have re&s;erved them&s;elves to bet|ter Fortunes: But &s;uch Pretences as the&s;e, and follow'd immediately by Performances of &s;everal Parts of them, it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, were as well Calculated to draw the People of that Country in, as could be expected even by them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="104">
This Speech, or whatever farther the Earl might &s;ay to animate a Set of Men already prepar'd for the Work, and who perhaps waited for nothing but to &s;ee a Per&s;on Authorized, as they may call it, from the <HI>Pretender</HI> to head them, had the de&s;i|red Effect; for they all &s;eparated with a&s;&s;urances to one another, to go immediately to work to arm their Men, and put them in a readine&s;s to appear at &s;uch Time and Place as the Earl by farther Notice &s;hould appoint.</P>
<P>The Earl, who had now made him&s;elf Head of the Undertaking, had no more to do but to begin the War him&s;elf, and therefore, making no Delay, but drawing his own Men together, with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e Gentlemen who were near|e&s;t hand, he appoints the General Rendezvous at <HI>Aboyn</HI> in <HI>Aberdeen&s;hire,</HI> on the 3d of <HI>September,</HI> and having found a con&s;iderable Number of Men ready at the Place, they march'd by Concert to the Hills, and Proclaimed the <HI>Pretender,</HI> &s;etting up his Standard at <HI>Brae-Marr,</HI> and giving him all the Titles of King, as u&s;ed before the Union; <HI>(viz.)</HI> of <HI>Scotland, England, France,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> &amp;c. They had with them about 2000 Men, mo&s;t Hor&s;e, and among them a great many Gentlemen, &s;ome Clergymen of the Epi&s;copal Church, and two or three Noblemen, of whom hereafter.</P>
<P>The Dye being now ca&s;t, and the Sword drawn, the Scabbard behoved to be thrown away. They were not ignorant of the Power they had to deal with; that they had no Time to lo&s;e; and that the fir&s;t thing they had to do was to Strengthen them&s;elves in &s;uch a manner as that they might not be attack'd by &s;uch Forces as the King had then in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to march and po&s;&s;e&s;s them|&s;elves of &s;ome Place of Con&s;ideration, which might

&s;erve them as a Place of Arms, and for a Retreat where they might make a &s;tand, and by which means they might have Lei&s;ure to cut off the Com|munication with the re&s;t of <HI>Britain,</HI> and &s;o the more effectually reduce all the Country behind them.</P>
<P>In order to this, they immediately &s;eparated their Forces, which where now Encrea&s;ing every Day, and the Heads of the Con&s;piracy, as it might be call'd, cau&s;ed the <HI>Pretender</HI> to be Proclaimed in all the mo&s;t Con&s;iderable Parts of the Country, as at <HI>Aberdeen</HI> by the Earl <HI>Mari&s;chal;</HI> by the Mar|quis of <HI>Tullibardin,</HI> at <HI>Dunkeld</HI> in the Entrance of the Highlands of <HI>Athol;</HI> by the Marquis of <HI>Hunt|ley,</HI> at <HI>Ca&s;tle-Gordon</HI> in the North Highlands; by the Earl of <HI>Penmure,</HI> at <HI>Brechin;</HI> by Brigadier <HI>Mackinto&s;h,</HI> at <HI>Inverne&s;s;</HI> by <HI>Graham</HI> of <HI>Claverhou&s;e,</HI> at <HI>Montro&s;e;</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> him&s;elf, who&s;e Body of Troops began now to be Con&s;iderable, and were &s;aid to be 6000 Men, advanced Southward to|wards the River <HI>Tay,</HI> and &s;tiling him&s;elf Lieuten|ant General, &s;ent a Detachment of Troops under the Command of the Earl of <HI>Southesk</HI> to &s;eize upon the City of <HI>Perth;</HI> whereby he was not only ma&s;ter of the Pa&s;s over the <HI>Tay,</HI> but &s;oon after made him|&s;elf &s;o far Ma&s;ter of the County of <HI>Fife,</HI> as to lay it under Contribution. And &s;oon after po&s;&s;e&s;t him&s;elf of all the North-Ea&s;t Shore of <HI>Scotland,</HI> all the North Shore of the <HI>Firth,</HI> and all the Towns and Ports as well on the <HI>Firth</HI> as on the Sea, from <HI>Brunt-I&s;land</HI> to <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Inver|ne&s;s,</HI> and even of <HI>Inverne&s;s</HI> it &s;elf.</P>
<P>The Progre&s;s of the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> being thus far accounted for, I come to look into the Mea&s;ures taken at Home, and what particular Steps the
<PB N="105" REF="106">
Government took for the Publick Security. It was plain, the whole Succe&s;&s;ion, as well as the Per&s;on of the King, was aim'd at in this In&s;ur|rection; and the King under&s;tood his Danger and his Intere&s;t al&s;o, too well to &s;it &s;till in a Ca&s;e which &s;o particularly concerned both the Honour of his Government and the Safety of his Per&s;on; it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that the King &s;hew'd a very remarkable Steadine&s;s, as to the Event of the Thing, and yet neglected nothing which Pru|dence dictated to apply &s;uitable Remedies to eve|ry Part of the Di&s;temper. But above all, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erv'd, That the Progre&s;s of the E. of <HI>Mar</HI> did not &s;o alarm the Government as to cau&s;e them to leave any part of the Kingdom naked; which was, perhaps, one con&s;iderable View of tho&s;e who made their Ri&s;ings be in the mo&s;t remote Parts another way.</P>
<P>But the Government rather &s;eem'd to give a loo&s;e for &s;ome time to the Extravagancies in the North, than not with the utmo&s;t Vigilance and Application to &s;ecure every thing and every Part by which the Party could reap any Advantage, or break in upon them on any &s;ide nearer Home. In&s;omuch, that the <HI>Scots</HI> not &s;eeing the Nece&s;&s;ity of the&s;e Mea&s;ures, began to complain, and to think them&s;elves, as it were, abandon'd too much to the Ravages of the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI>'s Army, a great Detachment of which pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Firth,</HI> in&s;ulted them even at the Gates of <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> as &s;hall be &s;een in its place.</P>
<P>But the Government &s;oon made it appear, that this was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, and that Care &s;hould be taken of the South, as the animal Spirits, in Ca&s;e of an Attack, fly to the Heart; for that it was apparent, the &s;ame Temper reign'd in the&s;e
<PB N="106" REF="107">
Parts, and e&s;pecially in the South-We&s;t Parts of the Kingdom, and threatned not only a powerful In&s;urrection at Home, but the landing of Help from Abroad; and particularly, the Duke of <HI>Or|mond</HI> not only was expected, but did actually come in a <HI>French</HI> Frigat of Forty Guns, to <HI>Tor Bay,</HI> and landed there; but finding, by good Intelligence, that all Things were &s;o well guarded that no At|tempt was to be made, his Grace made off again &s;o timely as not to be intercepted; though &s;ome Men of War were immediately di&s;patcht in que&s;t of him.</P>
<P>In Pur&s;uance of the&s;e Mea&s;ures, leaving the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> to do his wor&s;t for a while, the Go|vernment di&s;patch'd Troops down into the We&s;t and North-We&s;t Parts of the I&s;land; as to <HI>Bri&s;tol, Bath, Exeter, Oxford,</HI> and other Places; in which Parts the Di&s;affection of the People had really appeared &s;o very open, that they had avowed their Readine&s;s to take Arms, if an Opportunity offered, and had more than declar'd, that &s;uch an Opportunity was expected by them: For in &s;ome Places they had gone &s;o far as to provide Arms and Ammunition, Hor&s;es and Men, to be in rea|dine&s;s for the Juncture which they look'd for, or the Watch-word that was to be given. In a word, the Forces were di&s;pers'd through the whole Kingdom, and the Half-pay Officers were &s;ent to proper Places, where they might be u&s;eful, as well to manage and di&s;cipline the Militia, as to encourage and direct the Gentry, in Ca&s;e of any Surprize. And yet all was done in &s;uch a manner as that a &s;mall march, the Troops might upon any alarm be drawn into con&s;iderable Bodies, to a&s;&s;i&s;t one another: The Wi&s;dom of this Di&s;po&s;ition was its own Ju&s;tification afterwards, when it ap|peared
<PB N="107" REF="108">
that this only was the Safety of the whole Nation; whereas, had an Army been drawn to|gether at fir&s;t, and &s;ent into <HI>Scotland</HI> to have &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed the Rebellion on that &s;ide, <HI>England</HI> had without doubt been expo&s;ed to In&s;urrections in &s;everal Places, and perhaps too &s;trong to be &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed, without Recalling part of that Army be|fore their Work had been fini&s;h'd in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>While the Military Di&s;po&s;itions were thus di|rected, the Civil Government was not Idle; Su&s;|pected Per&s;ons were taken up in all Parts of the Kingdom, according to the Power granted by the Act of Parliament mention'd before; and this was done at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> as well as at <HI>London.</HI> Nor did the Government take their Aim wrong, as afterwards appeared; mo&s;t, if not all, the Per&s;ons taken up, having given good Grounds to believe they had been actually in Arms, if they had not been thus prevented.</P>
<P>The chief Per&s;ons apprehended at this Time, were, the Duke of <HI>Powis,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> and <HI>Scar&s;dale,</HI> the Lords <HI>Lan&s;down, Dunbar,</HI> and <HI>Du|plin,</HI> Son-in-Law to the Earl of <HI>Oxford;</HI> Sir <HI>Mar|maduke Con&s;table;</HI> Sir <HI>William Wyndham</HI> was nam'd, but fled, and was apprehended by a Me&s;&s;enger, but made his E&s;cape; and a Proclamation being publi&s;h'd for apprehending him, he &s;urrendered, and was committed to the Tower. Col. <HI>Landown,</HI> Mr. <HI>Harvey</HI> of Coomb, Sir <HI>George Brown,</HI> Mr. <HI>An|&s;tis,</HI> &s;ince King at Arms; Mr. <HI>Kyna&s;ton,</HI> Mr. <HI>Mackartney,</HI> Mr. <HI>Macdonald,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hibert,</HI> and ma|ny others, &s;ome at <HI>London,</HI> &s;ome at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and &s;ome at the <HI>Bath.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>For&s;ter</HI> of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Dar|wentwater,</HI> the Lord <HI>Widdrington,</HI> and &s;everal other North Country Gentlemen, were order'd to be
<PB N="108" REF="109">
taken up; but they prevented it, to their own Misfortune, by flying to Arms; And this began the Second Irruption, of which I &s;hall &s;peak in its place.</P>
<P>Some of the above-nam'd Gentlemen being Members of the Hou&s;e of Commons, the King was very tender in that Point, it being Parliament Time; &s;o his Maje&s;ty, by Me&s;&s;age, acquainted the Hou&s;e of it, <HI>September</HI> 21 &s;t, &s;ignifying, <Q>&startq;That having ju&s;t Cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect tho&s;e Six Gentle|men were engag'd in a De&s;ign to &s;upport the in|tended Inva&s;ion of this Kingdom, his Maje&s;ty had therefore given Order for apprehending them, and de&s;ired the Con&s;ent of the Hou&s;e to Commit and Detain them, if he finds it nece&s;&s;ary, in Pur&s;uance of the late Act of Parliament Em|powering&endq; him &s;o to do.</Q></P>
<P>In An&s;wer to this, the Hou&s;e immediately gave up their Six Members to his Maje&s;ty's Plea&s;ure, as to the Committing and Detaining them, in an Addre&s;s to that Purpo&s;e; Returning Thanks to the King for his tender Regard to the Privileges of the Hou&s;e; And de&s;ired his Maje&s;ty would give Order for the Committing and Detaining the &s;everal Members mentioned in the &s;aid Me&s;&s;age, pur&s;uant to the Act of Parliament; which was af|terwards accordingly done, tho' all of them were not immediately found; nor were all that were found, detain'd.</P>
<P>In <HI>Scotland</HI> they proceeded by another Method, <HI>(viz.)</HI> Summoning tho&s;e they Su&s;pected, to come in by a certain Day, and to give &s;uch A&s;&s;urances of Fidelity to the Government, as the Law di|rected; and this upon Pain of Impri&s;onment, and Confi&s;cation of E&s;tate, as by the Laws of that

<P>While the&s;e Mea&s;ures were taken here, &s;uch Troops as could be &s;pared were &s;ent Northward, e&s;pecially into <HI>Che&s;hire, Lanca&s;hire,</HI> and to the Bor|ders of <HI>Northumberland, (viz.)</HI> to <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne;</HI> which la&s;t Place went within a little of be|ing Surpriz'd, as I &s;hall ob&s;erve in its order.</P>
<P>What Forces were in <HI>Scotland,</HI> were ordered to take Po&s;t at <HI>Sterling,</HI> to &s;ecure the important Pa&s;s of <HI>Sterling-Bridge;</HI> and in the Capital City of <HI>E|dinburgh,</HI> where a De&s;ign to Surprize the Ca&s;tle had been newly di&s;covered, and the Per&s;ons who attempted it beaten off, a Serjeant of the Garri|&s;on who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted to Betray the Ca&s;tle, with &s;ome of the Soldiers, were &s;eized; the fir&s;t of them, &s;ome time after the Rebellion was &s;up|pre&s;s'd, was Hang'd over the Wall of the Ca|&s;tle.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, had the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> &s;uc|ceeded in the De&s;ign of Surpri&s;ing <HI>Edinburgh</HI>
<PB N="111" REF="112">
Ca&s;tle, and Mr. <HI>Forster</HI> in that of Surpri&s;ing <HI>New|ca&s;tle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne,</HI> both which were, as it might be &s;aid, within an ace of being brought to pa&s;s, the Rebellion had been much more formidable than it was: For as one would have been effectu|ally Ma&s;ter of the Capital City of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and thereby indeed of all <HI>Scotland</HI> it &s;elf; and the o|ther of the Second Town in <HI>Britain,</HI> for Numbers of Men, Number of Ships, and Uten&s;ils of War; they would have had not only Time, but Means to have rai&s;ed a great Army, and have for &s;ome Time been Ma&s;ters of half the I&s;land of <HI>Britain.</HI> But Fate had other Events appointed, as well on one Side as on the other.</P>
<P>Now, to carry on the Face of a War in a Regu|lar manner, the King, tho' more Forces could not yet be &s;pared to <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;ent down thither the Duke of <HI>Argyle,</HI> with the Honour of General of all the Forces in that Part of <HI>Great Britain</HI> call'd <HI>Scot|land,</HI> and Two Regiments of Foot and One of Dragoons were ordered to be &s;ent from <HI>Ireland</HI> to Reinforce the Troops there; al&s;o the 6000 Men which were expected every Day from <HI>Holland,</HI> were determin'd to be &s;ent thither. For, as for <HI>England</HI> it was re&s;olved, that no Troops &s;hould be &s;pared from thence yet, co&s;t what it would.</P>
<P>All this while the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> went on &s;treng|thening him&s;elf in <HI>Scotland,</HI> extending his Quar|ters, taking in Towns, and putting him&s;elf in a Po&s;ture for Action. And it mu&s;t be confe&s;t, that notwith&s;tanding his being di&s;appointed in the Surpri&s;ing the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> yet he had time enough as well to encrea&s;e his Army as to fortify his Po&s;t; which had he done, he had not been &s;o ea|&s;ily forced, and might perhaps have made better Conditions for him&s;elf, and the unhappy Body that
<PB N="112" REF="113">
attended him, when he found him&s;elf unable to re&s;i&s;t any longer.</P>
<P>And this makes me more apt to give Credit to what the Lord <HI>Mar</HI> publi&s;h'd; <HI>(viz.)</HI> That he was not a&s;&s;i&s;ted from abroad as he expected, and as was reported. For this is mo&s;t certain, that had he fortify'd the Town of <HI>Perth,</HI> as it was once &s;aid he had, with a Line, and five Ba&s;tions, and a double Counter&s;carp; I &s;ay, had he done this, and had been furni&s;hed with Artillery, and a Magazine of Ammunition for its Defence, the Royal Army either would not have attempted it in that de&s;perate rigorous Sea&s;on in which they did, or mu&s;t have been ruin'd in the Attack; &s;ee|ing it was impo&s;&s;ible the Men could have born the vehemence of the Cold two Nights more than they did, in the open Field.</P>
<P>But it appear'd, they had only 4 Pieces of Can|non in the whole Town, and not Ammunition enough to have &s;erv'd the Cannon, which the De|fence of &s;uch a Town requir'd, no not for Four Days; &s;o that it is apparent, they abandon'd that Place meerly by the nece&s;&s;ity of their Circum&s;tan|ces: Not for want of Men, but want of Means for a Defence.</P>
<P>To give the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> therefore his due, it is certain he made the be&s;t of it; he put a good Face upon every Thing; and having a vi&s;ible Superiority of Forces, he pu&s;ht as far as lay in his Power; by which, and by all the other Circum&s;tances of his Conduct, it appears, that he depended upon the Ri&s;ing of other Parties in <HI>Eng|land</HI> at the &s;ame Time.</P>
<P>He had, as is ob&s;erved, taken <HI>Perth,</HI> which was indeed a great Blow to the publick Affairs; not only as it &s;ecured him the whole Country be|hind,
<PB N="113" REF="114">
but as it elevated the Spirits of his Men to expect greater Matters, gave Reputation to his Undertaking, and made him appear formidable abroad. Nor was it a little advantage to him in the main Article of rai&s;ing Money; for now he laid all the Country between the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Forth</HI> and the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Tay,</HI> under Contribution.</P>
<P>By this Step he had Opportunity al&s;o to make &s;ome very &s;ucce&s;sful Excur&s;ions; as particularly, that of <HI>Brunt-I&s;land,</HI> which was an Affair very well fore&s;een, and very well executed; the Ca&s;e was this: <Q>&startq;About 400 &s;mall Arms, with Ammunition in Proportion, and &s;everal other Military Stores, were order'd by the Government out of the Magazine at <HI>Edinburgh-Ca&s;tle,</HI> for the U&s;e of the Earl of <HI>Sutherland,</HI> who was going to <HI>Dunrobin,</HI> in the No$th, in order to rai&s;e a Force in the Rear of the Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> as &s;hall be &s;een in its&endq; Cour&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The&s;e Arms and Warlike Stores were put on Board a Ve&s;&s;el belonging to <HI>Brunt-I&s;land,</HI> a Town on the North-&s;ide of the <HI>Firth,</HI> directly oppo&s;ite to <HI>Leith;</HI> and the Ve&s;&s;el being loaden, lay &s;ome Days for a fair Wind in <HI>Leith</HI> Road; but the Wind blowing hard at North-Ea&s;t, which makes a foul Road in the offing of <HI>Leith,</HI> the Ma&s;ter weighed, and &s;tood over to the Shore of <HI>Fife</HI> near <HI>Brunt-I&s;land,</HI> which was then the Weather-Shore: As the Ship was known in the Town, the Ma|&s;ter and Owners being all Inhabitants; &s;o the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> got Intelligence of it, and of her&endq; Loading al&s;o.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Immediately, upon this Advice, he made a Detachment of 400 Hor&s;e and 500 Foot, to &s;eize this Booty; part of the Hor&s;e went before, carrying every Man a Footman behind him,
<PB N="114" REF="115">
they order'd their March &s;o, as to come to <HI>Brunt-I&s;land</HI> in the middle of the Night, to pre|vent any Boat going off the Ship to give her Notice to cut and be gone, or to the Men of War to come in to her Re&s;cue: But by their entring in the Dark, they &s;urpriz'd the Town; and immediately the Foot, knowing their Bu|&s;ine&s;s, &s;eiz'd upon all the Boats upon the Shore, or in the Harbour, the Hor&s;e, in the mean time, &s;urrounding the Town, to prevent any one go|ing out to carry the News to other Parts, &s;o as that any Boats might go off from <HI>Kinghorn,</HI> which&endq; was a Town within two Miles.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Having thus &s;eized upon the Boats, they em|bark'd about 120 of their Men, and boarded the Ship, &s;eiz'd and &s;ecur'd her without any Oppo&s;ition; they weighed her Anchor, as &s;ome &s;ay, with De&s;ign to bring her into the Har|bour; but the Tide not &s;erving, they dropt the Anchor again, and fell to work with her Cargo; in &s;hort, they &s;oon handed out the Arms and Stores, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> into their Boats; and pre&s;&s;ing Carts and Hor&s;es in the Country round, they carried off their Booty the next Day, with|out any Oppo&s;ition. It &s;eems this Detachment march'd &s;o &s;ilently, or the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI>'s Spies, or Scouts, did their Duty &s;o ill, that he had no Intelligence of their March till the next Day in the Afternoon, when the &s;ame Per|&s;ons that acquainted him of their March, a&s;&s;u|red him of the Succe&s;s of it, and that it was to no Purpo&s;e to attempt to intercept them in their Retreat, for that they were already gotten great Part of the Way; carrying their Booty, for their greater Safety, directly to <HI>Dundee:</HI> Tho' that Part of the Intelligence was wrong
<PB N="115" REF="116">
too, if the re&s;t of the Story be right; which was&endq; this:</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;That the Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> not doubting but the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> would have Notice of their March, and would make a &s;trong Detachment to intercept them in their Return, re&s;olved to march in Per&s;on to a Town call'd <HI>Arva,</HI> within four or five Miles of <HI>Sterling,</HI> with 6000 Men, in order to alarm the Duke, and divert him from attempting to &s;end any Detachment out to intercept his Men with their Booty; or that if &s;uch Detachment was made, then to face the Left, and cut of the Retreat off that Detach|ment.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;This Stratagem took as well as he could wi&s;h; for the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> hearing that the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> was to be at <HI>Arva</HI> with a &s;trong Detach|ment that Night, the willinger laid a&s;ide his De&s;ign of &s;ending a Party to intercept the Men that had the Booty, order'd out the Piquet, both of Hor&s;e and Foot, to fall upon the Rebels, and kept the re&s;t of the Army under Arms all Day, to be ready to &s;u&s;tain them, if the Enemy&endq; were too &s;trong for them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;But the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> had done his Bu&s;ine&s;s; for the Booty being &s;eized according to his De|&s;ire, and the Troops gone with it directly for <HI>Perth,</HI> and pa&s;t Danger, he gave him&s;elf no Trouble to go to <HI>Arva,</HI> as was intended; but having amu&s;ed the Royal Army with Expectati|ons of an Action, he did his own Bu&s;ine&s;s with|out any vi&s;ible Difficulty; and the Duke's Men having found that no Enemy had been at <HI>Arva,</HI> or was to be heard of, retir'd to <HI>Sterling.</HI> The&s;e Things were done the &s;econd and third of <HI>Octo|ber,&endq;</HI> 1715.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="117">
Thus far the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> went on with great Succe&s;s, and his Party were hearten'd to a Degree greater than they them&s;elves expected; and the&s;e Things had this particular Effect al&s;o; That it encouraged the march of their Friends from all Parts to join them; and Troops came to them eve|ry Day; as particularly, they publi&s;h'd, That Brigadier <HI>Mackinto&s;h</HI> joined him, the 5th of <HI>Octo|ber,</HI> with 500 Men, almo&s;t all of them of the &s;ame Name. On the 6th, the Marquis of <HI>Huntley</HI> came in with 500 Hor&s;e and 2000 Foot. On the 10th, the Earl <HI>Mari&s;chal</HI> brought him 300 Hor&s;e, and 500 Foot, and abundance of Gentlemen a|mong them. The Earl of <HI>Scaforth</HI> continued with 4000 Men, Hor&s;e and Foot, in the North, to face the Earl of <HI>Sutherland,</HI> who arm'd there for the King, having been &s;ent by Sea thither for that Purpo&s;e, with Arms, Ammunition, and a Com|mi&s;&s;ion for Rai&s;ing Men.</P>
<P>Being thus encouraged, they rang'd over the whole Country, and lived at large for &s;ome time. The Accounts made publick at that Time, gave &s;everal Particulars of Ships coming daily in with Arms, Ammunition, Money, Officers, and Volun|tiers; but as the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> po&s;itively denies that ever any &s;uch Ships came in, and that, as before, it appear'd plainly enough, that they never were &s;upplied with either Cannon, Ammunition, or Arms, I cannot but think what the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> publi&s;h'd, was &s;o far at lea&s;t True.</P>
<P>Indeed, as they were now po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of near Two thirds of <HI>Scotland,</HI> their Friends, if they had any Intere&s;t abroad, had a fair Advantage to have pu&s;h'd the Cau&s;e: But 'twas evident, the King's Intere&s;t, and the Vigilance of his Agents abroad, was &s;uch as effectually prevented any thing being
<PB N="117" REF="118">
done for them: And even in <HI>France</HI> it &s;elf, what Attempts were made to &s;upply them with Arms and Ammunition, Men and Money, was di&s;cou|raged, and forbidden even by the Regent him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>All this while the King's Army, which drew together at <HI>Sterling,</HI> under the Command of Ma|jor-General <HI>Wightman,</HI> could not, with the addi|tion of Two Regiments of Dragoons, make up full 1800 Men: And tho' there was &s;ome talk of a great Body of We&s;tern Highlanders coming in, yet they never came up; at lea&s;t, not to any Action. However, this &s;mall Body kept the Rebels from pa&s;&s;ing the River <HI>Forth,</HI> and Ravaging the South of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as they would otherwi&s;e have done, but were not able, without extream Hazard, to do, as appeared afterwards. There was indeed another Bridge over the <HI>Forth,</HI> higher up the River, call'd the Bridge of <HI>Down;</HI> but this the King's Troops &s;ent a &s;trong Detachment to De|moli&s;h and break down; which was accordingly done. And as for the Fords, they were all un|pa&s;&s;able at that Sea&s;on, by Rea&s;on of the great Rains and Snows which fell continually for &s;ome Weeks together.</P>
<P>Thus Providence, and the Care of the General, kept the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> and his Army from coming over the <HI>Forth;</HI> which had they done, the Low|lands of <HI>Clyd&s;dale,</HI> and the City of <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> with all the We&s;t Part of <HI>Scotland,</HI> had been over-run by them, and they would have had an open Pa&s;|&s;age into <HI>England</HI> by the way of <HI>Drumfries&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Carli&s;le.</HI></P>
<P>Nor can the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> ever be excu&s;ed by his Party, either of want of Courage, or want of Conduct, that he being &s;o &s;trong as was reported,
<PB N="118" REF="119">
<HI>(viz.)</HI> 10 or 12000 Men, and the King's Army not full 2000 Men, that he &s;hould not march and have forced his way at <HI>Sterling,</HI> or at <HI>Alloway,</HI> his own Hereditary Seat, where he might have ferried over his Army, the River being narrow enough, and might have driven the few Troops the King's Officers had there, either all into the Ca&s;tle, where they mu&s;t have peri&s;hed for want, or have obliged them to Surrender. But it was not done; and indeed they did little more than &s;it &s;till for &s;everal Months, and con&s;ume them&s;elves, as will appear in the re&s;t of the Sto|ry.</P>
<P>It is true, the King's Men were entrench'd un|der the Cannon of the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Sterling,</HI> and the Bridge was ea&s;ily defended: But on the other hand, the Enemy might have only fac'd the Bridge with one Part of their Army, while they had pa&s;s'd the River with the other, and they could not have met with any Di&s;turbance, at that Time, from the Royal Army, their Number was &s;o &s;mall: Nor dur&s;t they have divided their Troops for fear of the Bridge being attackt on one hand while they might have marcht to have ob&s;tructed the Landing on the other. The Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> therefore, can never be excu&s;ed by his Friends, that he had not marcht with his whole Army while the Royal Army was &s;o &s;mall; in which Ca&s;e, had he pa&s;t the <HI>Forth</HI> at <HI>Alloway,</HI> and marcht directly to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> the City had been in no Condition to have &s;hut her Gates again&s;t them. But the Saying of the Ancients was verified in them:</P>
<Q>Qui Jupiter Vult perdere hos dementat.</Q>
<P><PB N="119" REF="120">
I return now to the Hi&s;tory of Fact. The Re|bellion was now in its full Strength in the North of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> being, as I have &s;aid, fully po&s;&s;e&s;t of the whole Country North by <HI>Forth;</HI> and tho' the South Parts were not yet in his Hands, yet even they, were in a very un|&s;ettled and precarious Condition: Even the City of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> it &s;elf, tho' the Sum of the affair con&s;i&s;ted in their Safety, were yet without Arms, without Artillery, and without Troops to Cover and Defend them. The Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> indeed was &s;ent down; and his very Pre&s;ence, joined with his Authority, was a great Encouragement to the Citizens. But alas! he brought no Troops with him; not one Regiment; and bare Words would have gone but a little way with them, if the Enemy had appeared in any Numbers &s;uffici|ent to have forced them.</P>
<P>The Duke however did what he could, and, in particular, publi&s;hed an Order for the Encou|raging of Voluntiers; of whom great Numbers were talk'd of, but few appear'd. However, that it might be &s;een the General did what lay in his Power, to bring them together, he publi&s;hed the following Order:</P>
<Q><P>John, <HI>Duke of</HI> Argyle, <HI>General and Commander in Chief of his Maje&s;ty's Forces in</HI> North-Britain, <HI>to the Lords Lieutenants, Deputy Lieutenants; and in their Ab&s;ence, to the Well-affected Heritors in the We&s;tern and Southern Shires in</HI> Scotland, <HI>and in particular to the Ju&s;tices of Peace, Magi&s;trates of Burghs, and other Judges and Officers, Civil and Military.</HI></P></Q>
<P><Q>&startq;WHHEREAS great Numbers of well-affected Noblemen, Gentlemen, and others, in the
<PB N="120" REF="121">
Southern and We&s;tern Shires of <HI>Scotland,</HI> being in readine&s;s to march to &s;uch Places as they &s;hall be appointed, may be de&s;irous to have a par|ticular Order for that Effect The&s;e are there|fore, in his Maje&s;ty's Name, and by his Autho|rity, requiring, ordering, and authorizing the Lord Lieutenants, Lieutenant-Deputies; or, in their Ab&s;ence, all well affected Heritors, and each of them, in the We&s;tern and Southern Shires afore&s;aid, to march forthwith their &s;en|cible Men, with their be&s;t Arms, and what Ammunition they have, and with Forty Days Provi&s;ion, towards <HI>Gla&s;gow;</HI> and to quarter there, or in the adjacent Towns or Villages on the North-&s;ide of the River <HI>Clyde,</HI> in order to be ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the oppo&s;ing and extin|gui&s;hing the Rebellion, now rais'd again&s;t our Laws, our Liberties, and the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Religi|on. Given at our Camp at <HI>Stirling,</HI> the 2d of&endq; <HI>October,</HI> 1715.</Q></P>
<P>ARGYLE.</P>
<P>But as the Duke found few come in, and the Earl of <HI>Rothes,</HI> and the Voluntiers which were a&s;&s;embled at <HI>L$&s;h,</HI> (his Lord&s;hip's Hou&s;e) were obliged to abandon it, and di&s;per&s;e again; the Duke plainly &s;aw that nothing but regular Di&s;ci|plin'd Forces could do the Work, and wrote at large to the King, to lay before his Maje&s;ty the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ending &s;peedy Succours.</P>
<P>But all that the Court could do at that time, was to a&s;&s;ure him, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> Troops, which were expected every hour, &s;hould be di&s;patch'd to <HI>Scotland</HI> as &s;oon as they arrived. The Duke then apply'd him&s;elf to rai&s;e Men there by Beat of Drum, to fill up the Companies who were up|on
<PB N="121" REF="122">
the old Foot, and to rai&s;e each Company to 50 Men each; but this did not an&s;wer the End any more than the other, the Drum bringing in very few Voluntiers.</P>
<P>The Sword of War being now drawn, the Votes and Speeches of Parliament began to De|crea&s;e, and the Hou&s;es drawing their Bu&s;ine&s;s to a Cro&s;e, all Things tended to a Rece&s;s.</P>
<P>In order to this, the King came to the Hou&s;e the 21&s;t of <HI>September,</HI> when the Speaker pre&s;ent|ed the Money Bills, he made a Speech to the King, which, for Brevity's &s;ake, I omit. After the Speaker had pre&s;ented his Bills, the King gave the Royal A&s;&s;ent to the following publick Acts:</P>
<P N="1">1. An Act to enable his Maje&s;ty to &s;ettle a Revenue upon her Royal Highne&s;s.</P>

<P><HI>My Lords and Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The open and declared Rebellion, which is now actually begun in <HI>Scotland,</HI> mu&s;t convince all, who do not wi&s;h to &s;ee us given up into the Hands of a <HI>Popi&s;h Pretender,</HI> of the Dangers to&endq; which we have been, and are &s;till expos'd.</Q></P>

<Q>&startq;I thought it incumbent upon me, to give you the earlie&s;t Notice of the De&s;igns of our Ene|mies; and I cannot &s;ufficiently commend the Zeal and Di&s;patch with which you empower'd me, at a Time when the Nation was in &s;o na|ked and defencele&s;s a Condition, to make &s;uch Preparations as I &s;hould think nece&s;&s;ary for our Security. You &s;hall have no Rea&s;on to repent of the Tru&s;t and Confidence you repo&s;e in me, which I &s;hall never u&s;e to any other End, than for the Protection and Welfare of my&endq; People.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;It was &s;carce to be imagined, That any of my <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Subjects, who have known and enjoyed the Benefits of our excellent Con&s;titu|tion, and have heard of the great Dangers they were wonderfully deliver'd from by the happy Revolution, &s;hould, by any Arts and Management, be drawn into Mea&s;ures that mu&s;t at once de&s;troy their Religion and Liberties, and &s;ubject them to Popery and arbitrary Power; but &s;uch has been our Misfortune, that too ma|ny of my People have been deluded, and made in&s;trumental to the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s De&s;igns, who had never dared to think of invading us, or rai&s;ing a Rebellion, had he not been encouraged by the Succe&s;s his Emi&s;&s;aries and Adherents have already had, in &s;tirring up Riots and Tumults, and by the further Hopes they entertain, of rai&s;ing In&s;urrections in many Parts of my King|doms.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The endeavouring to per&s;wade my People, that the Church of <HI>England</HI> is in Danger under my Government, has been the main Artifice employed in carrying on this wicked and trai|terous De&s;ign. This In&s;inuation, after the &s;o|lemn

After this Speech, the Hou&s;es were order'd to adjourn them&s;elves to the 6th of <HI>October;</HI> from whence, by farther Adjournments, they had a Rece&s;s to the 14th of <HI>December,</HI> when, by Procla|mation, they had Notice to &s;it again to do Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, as we &s;hall &s;ee in its Place.</P>
<P>It began now to appear, by the Face of Affairs in <HI>England,</HI> that the Heart of the Rebellion was broken, and that not by the King's Forces; for there had been no Action yet, in which the King's Intere&s;t had not been rather Lo&s;er than Gainer, except that of the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Edinburgh.</HI> But the breaking the Mea&s;ures of tho&s;e who had lay'd their Schemes for making the Rebellion General, or rather Univer&s;al, this, I &s;ay, was a Great Blow given to the Intere&s;t, and did more than over|throwing the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> and all his Army would have done.</P>
<P>The Surpri&s;ing Sir <HI>William Wyndham,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Harvey</HI> of Coomb, who endeavour'd to de|&s;troy him&s;elf by &s;tabbing him&s;elf into the Body; the Di&s;per&s;ing the Gentlemen at the <HI>Bath,</HI> and &s;eizing their Arms; the cru&s;hing the Corre&s;pon|dences at <HI>Oxford;</HI> and in a word, po&s;ting Soldi|ers in every Corner of the Kingdom, &s;o that no|thing could &s;tir. The&s;e were the Di&s;appoint|ments; the&s;e were the Blows that wounded the Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> tho' at a great Di&s;tance, in the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Part, and which in effect Overthrew the whole Undertaking: For it is evident, the main Dependance of the Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> and his whole Army, was not that they were able fight or grap|ple with the King's whole Power; but that they expected the whole Party &s;hould ri&s;e throughout the Kingdom, and &s;hould &s;o divide the Royal
<PB N="126" REF="127">
Forces as that he &s;hould be able to do his Work without being obliged to fight with a Superior Number of Troops before he was ready to en|gage them.</P>
<P>This the Government was aware of, and this was the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Point the Mini&s;try had to guard again&s;t; and which was &s;o effectually done, that nothing could &s;tir in the remote&s;t Cor|ner, but the King had Troops at hand to attack and &s;uppre&s;s it, even in its Bud, in its Infancy; as was the Ca&s;e at the <HI>Bath,</HI> at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> at <HI>Shrews|bury,</HI> at <HI>Exce&s;ter,</HI> in <HI>Cornwal,</HI> at <HI>Manche&s;ter,</HI> at <HI>Ox|ford,</HI> and &s;everal other Places, where the Common People &s;hew'd their Di&s;po&s;itions to Revolt.</P>
<P>The North &s;eem'd the only Place where the Rebellion, being gotten to a Head, requir'd more Troops to reduce it than could be &s;par'd at that time, from the other more Nece&s;&s;ary Work of &s;e|curing the more dangerous Parts of the Kingdom. And this Place being &s;o remote, there appear'd le&s;s Hazard in letting them go on a while without being formally attackt, than would have been in other Places; and therefore, they were &s;uffered, for a while, to Range about the Country, and do a World of Mi&s;chief, more than they would otherwi&s;e have been permitted to do, Unfought with.</P>
<P>This Relates, particularly, to the Ri&s;ing of Mr. <HI>For&s;ter</HI> and his Party, in <HI>Northumberland;</HI> the Ri&s;ing of the Earl of <HI>Kenmure</HI> and his Party, in the We&s;t of <HI>Scotland;</HI> the Landing of Brigadier <HI>Mac|kinto&s;h</HI> on the South-&s;ide of the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Edinburgh.</HI> And the&s;e 3 Bodies joining together afterwards up|on the Borders, and Marching into <HI>England;</HI> which makes together the Second main Branch of the Rebellion; an Ab&s;tract of who&s;e Story I have re|&s;erv'd

for this Place, that it may come as whole together as I can, and the Reader may not lo&s;e him&s;elf in the frequent Interruptions of the Rela|tion.</P>
<P>There had been &s;ome Mea&s;ures concerted at <HI>London</HI> for this Ri&s;ing, &s;ome time before it broke out; to which Capt, <HI>John Shafloe,</HI> a Half-pay Officer, &s;ince executed at <HI>Pre&s;ton,</HI> and Capt. <HI>John Hunter</HI> of <HI>North-Tyne,</HI> in the County of <HI>Northum|berland,</HI> who had a Commi&s;&s;ion from Queen <HI>Anne</HI> to rai&s;e an independant Company, but did not, a&s;&s;i&s;ted: Be&s;ides the&s;e two, there was one Captain <HI>Robert Talbot,</HI> an <HI>Iri&s;hman,</HI> formerly in the <HI>French</HI> Service, who likewi&s;e being ac|quainted with the De&s;ign in <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1715, took Shipping at <HI>London,</HI> and went to <HI>Newca&s;tle.</HI> By this Gentleman, the Re&s;olutions taken at <HI>London</HI> were fir&s;t communicated to their Friends in the North of <HI>England,</HI> and Means u&s;ed to per&s;uade and prepare the Gentlemen they had embark'd with them, to be ready to ri&s;e upon Warning given. Other principal Men entru&s;ted with the&s;e Negotiations, were, Colonel <HI>Oxburgh,</HI> Mr. <HI>Nich.

They kept always moving, and travelled from Place to Place, till Things ri|pened for Action. The fir&s;t Step towards their appearing in Arms, was, when, about the latter end of <HI>September,</HI> the Lord <HI>Derwentwater</HI> and Mr. <HI>For&s;ter</HI> had notice that there was a Warrant out
<PB N="128" REF="129">

<P>Upon this News, they had a full Meeting of the Parties concern'd, in <HI>Northumberland;</HI> where con&s;ulting all the Circum&s;tances of their Friends, and of the Intere&s;t they were embark'd in, they boldly re&s;olv'd, That &s;ince there was no Safety any longer in &s;hifting from Place to Place; but that in a few Days they &s;hould be all &s;ecur'd, and clapp'd up in &s;everal Pri&s;ons, or hurried away to <HI>London;</HI> where as they &s;hould be &s;everally confin'd, &s;o they would be &s;everally examined, and none could &s;ay what the other &s;hould an&s;wer: So that for fear of betraying one another, they &s;hould be really brought to do it; That now was the time to &s;hew their Loyalty to their King <HI>(Pretender,)</HI> and that if this Opportunity was lo&s;t, they had no room to hope for another; and that therefore they would immediately appear in Arms.</P>
<P>Pur&s;uant to this Re&s;olution, an Appointment was made, and Notice of it &s;ent to all their Friends, to meet the next Morning, which was the 6th of <HI>October,</HI> at a Place called <HI>Green-rig,</HI> where Mr. <HI>For&s;ter,</HI> with about Twenty Gentle|men, met as at the Rendezvous; they made no &s;tay there, thinking the Place inconvenient, but rode immediately to the top of a Hill called the <HI>Waterfalls;</HI> from whence they might di&s;cover any that came either to join them, or to oppo&s;e them.

<P>This <HI>Manife&s;to</HI> being ended, the People with loud Acclamations &s;houted, <HI>NO Union! NO Malt, NO Salt-TAX!</HI> Then the Highlanders returned to their Quarters, where they continued till <HI>Thur&s;day.</HI></P>
<P>Matters were now run their full Length; and the King, who began now to appear more than Equal to all the Attempts that could be made again&s;t his Government, had Troops ready to engage them in every Place. <HI>N. B.</HI> The &s;ame Day the Attack was made at <HI>Pre&s;ton,</HI> that very Day the Two Armies in <HI>Scotland</HI> came to a pitch'd Battle.</P>
<P>As for tho&s;e at <HI>Pre&s;ton,</HI> their whole Conduct &s;ecur'd their Overthrow: And they might ea&s;ily have &s;een from the beginning, that they were never in any Condition to re&s;i&s;t the attack of Regular Troops; that they had neither Men di&s;ciplin'd, Officers experienced, or Magazines furni&s;hed; and which was more than all, no Subordination, no Subjection, no command among them. So that indeed they were rather a Crowd than an Army; and they could not without a Madne&s;s next to that of De&s;paration, have marcht, as they did, into the Heart of the Country, where they were &s;ure to be &s;urrounded, and to have no Po&s;&s;ibility left them of e&s;caping. But their Fate hurry'd them on, and there was no preventing it, as &s;hall be &s;een in the farther relation of the&s;e things.</P>
<P>I return to the Progre&s;s of the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who&s;e Circum&s;tances now appear'd very Encouraging indeed. He had with him, as they
<PB N="143" REF="144">
reported, near 12000 Men, well appointed, bold and re&s;olute for Action: Indeed they had need to be &s;o, for they were imbark'd in an Underta|king full of Terrors, which requir'd not Courage only, but even the Rage of De&s;pair to carry it on.</P>
<P>They had long talk'd of marching Southward, pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Forth,</HI> attacking the Duke of <HI>Argyle,</HI> and the like; and the Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> who knew very well the Courage of his Men, as well as the Reputation of his Undertaking, could not but be upheld by lying &s;till, finding he was now joined by mo&s;t of the Troops that he expected, re&s;olv'd to march, and accordingly cau&s;ed the Army to Rendezvous at a &s;mall Town call'd <HI>Auchterarder,</HI> near <HI>Perth,</HI> at once to amu&s;e the King's Ar|my, and execute his De&s;ign; He had all the Rea&s;on in the World to attempt this now, becau&s;e the King's Troops were &s;till very weak, all the Men the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> having yet with him, not exceeding 1500 Men, be&s;ides a few Volun|tiers, which at be&s;t never were above 200 at a time; nor were they above 100 at the Battle of <HI>Sherriffmuir.</HI> The Particulars of that Force, to explain this more fully, was thus &s;et forth even at that time.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Some Regiments having a little before been &s;ent to <HI>Ireland,</HI> all the Troops left in <HI>Scotland,</HI> at the breaking out of the Rebellion, were no more than the Regiments of Dragoons of <HI>Portmore</HI> and <HI>Stair;</HI> the latter call'd the <HI>White-Hor&s;es;</HI> and the Regiments of Foot of <HI>Shannon, Montague, Grant, Wightman, Orrery, Irwin,</HI> and <HI>Forfar;</HI> all which when together, &s;ome Detachments being made for Garri&s;ons at <HI>Inverlochy</HI> and <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> made up 1850 Men; and were afterwards rein|forc'd
<PB N="144" REF="145">
from <HI>Ireland</HI> with <HI>Evan</HI>'s Dragoons, <HI>Clay|ton</HI>'s and <HI>Mori&s;on</HI>'s Regiment of Foot, making to|gether about 850 Men more: There was indeed a great Appearance of the Nobility and Gentry, and great Talk of a large Number of Voluntiers from <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> and the <HI>We&s;t;</HI> the former indeed made up a hand&s;ome Body of about 150 Hor&s;e, all Per&s;ons of Di&s;tinction, and appear'd forward enough for Service; but of the latter we do not find, whatever Shew they made, that they ever came to any Action.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> therefore, who&s;e Troops were now hearty and numerous, far Superior to the King's Army, found that now was his time to enter upon Action, and to attack the King's For|ces, if po&s;&s;ible; or if not; to amu&s;e them, and pa&s;s the <HI>Forth,</HI> that he might &s;uccour and join his Friends in the South, and &s;o pu&s;h on the Grand De&s;ign before his Enemies were &s;trengthen'd with more Forces.</P>
<P>With this Re&s;olution he drew his Army toge|ther, and advanc'd with a Body of his Men to have a nearer View of the Situation of the Duke of <HI>Argyle;</HI> but finding he lay with his little Army, under the Cannon of <HI>Sterling,</HI> the River in his Front, and no Pa&s;&s;age but at the Bridge, which the Ca&s;tle commanded; that on the other hand, he was not provided with Boats for a Pa&s;&s;age, or with Materials for a Bridge, or time for building it; in a word, finding an Attempt there Impracticable, he re&s;olv'd upon &s;ending over a Body of Foot lower down, where the Pa&s;&s;age indeed was more difficult and dangerous, but where there were no Troops to oppo&s;e him, and where he &s;hould &s;ooner bring his Men to Action with more Advantage: This being re&s;olv'd on; the Place he pitch'd up|on
<PB N="145" REF="146">
was towards the Mouth of the <HI>Forth,</HI> where the Sea was no le&s;s than Ten or Twelve Miles over.</P>
<P>Though this was a hazardous Enterprize, there being &s;everal Men of War in the <HI>Firth;</HI> yet he both undertook and perform'd it with Succe&s;s; and had he &s;ent over 5000 Men in&s;tead of 2000, he had done his Bu&s;ine&s;s; for the Forces at hand to oppo&s;e him, was no way able to have with|&s;tood him; but he began his own way, and for what he did it was well enough managed: For having &s;ecretly cau&s;ed all the Boats on the Coa&s;t to be &s;eiz'd and &s;ecur'd, he &s;ent Brigadier <HI>Mac|kinto&s;h,</HI> a bold and &s;oldierly Man, to the Ea&s;t Part of <HI>Fife,</HI> with all the Secrecy po&s;&s;ible, having with him the Lord <HI>Strathmore,</HI> and &s;everal other very able Officers, and about 2000 Foot, mo&s;t Nor|thern <HI>Highland</HI> Men, with Orders to watch their Opportunity, when the Tide was coming in, that &s;o the Men of War might not be able to in|tercept them, to embark, and land them&s;elves on the other Shore; while this was doing, he caus'd another Body to march openly to <HI>Brunt-I&s;land,</HI> and getting &s;everal Boats together there, makes a Feint of embarking his Men there; the Men of War having Notice of his De&s;ign at <HI>Brunt-I&s;land,</HI> mann'd out their Boats, and &s;ent them to attack them, &s;lipping their Cables, and &s;tanding in for the Shore, in order to &s;econd the Boats; at which the Rebels, as if they were afraid of being taken, retir'd to <HI>Brunt-I&s;land;</HI> the Men of War &s;tood in after them, and let fly &s;everal Shot among them, but with little Damage; while, in the mean Time, they di&s;cover'd from their Top-Ma&s;ts, tho' but too late, that the main Body of the Re|bels were actually pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Firth</HI> 12 Miles be|low;
<PB N="146" REF="147">
and that they appear'd in the mid Channel, almo&s;t half over.</P>
<P>It was in vain for the Men of War to &s;tir, the Tide of Flood being very &s;trong again&s;t them, and little or no Wind, and that Wind that was, not very fair for them; all they could do, was to man out &s;ome Boats, which they did; who row|ing under Shore, came up time enough to inter|cept one of the Boats, with 45 Men in it, who labour'd under the Misfortune of having broken one of their Oars; this Boat they took, and the Men were carried Pri&s;oners into <HI>Leith,</HI> and put in|to the <HI>Talbooth;</HI> where, in a few Days, their Friends reliev'd them.</P>
<P>But the Men of War, as &s;oon as the Tide turn'd, falling down, came time enough to cut off Eight Boats, who were too far behind the re&s;t, and who had embark'd in another Place, and giving them Cha&s;e, they put back to the I&s;le of <HI>May,</HI> a &s;mall I&s;land on the South-Ea&s;t Point of <HI>Fifeland;</HI> where, being near 400 Men, the Men of Wars Boats dur&s;t not land their Men to attack them; and the next Day or two they landed again in <HI>Fife,</HI> with my Lord <HI>Strathmore</HI> at the Head of them.</P>
<P>The foremo&s;t Boats &s;et their Men &s;afe on Shore at <HI>Tantallon, Aberlady, North Berwick,</HI> and on the Shores between, to the Number of about 1600 Men, and Brigadier <HI>Mackinto&s;h</HI> at the Head of them; this was the 12th of <HI>October</HI> in the Morn|ing; and the &s;ame Day they march'd to <HI>Hadding|ton,</HI> a wall'd Town, and large, but not &s;trong, within 12 Miles of <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>
<P>It is ea&s;y to believe, that this &s;urpri&s;ing News put the People of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> into a terrible Con|&s;ternation; the Friends to the Government made no Doubt, but they would march directly to
<PB N="147" REF="148">
<HI>Edinburgh;</HI> and they knew great Numbers in that City waited only an Opportunity of &s;uch a Body of Men, to protect them in their appearing; &s;o they doubted nothing, but that they would make a general Revolt upon this Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>But this was the lea&s;t of the Danger; for had the Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> as was expected, advanced at the &s;ame Time with the Gro&s;s of his Army to face the Duke of <HI>Argyle,</HI> or to force his Way over the <HI>Forth,</HI> and at the &s;ame Time &s;ent over 2 or 3000 Men more, at the <HI>Queens-Ferry,</HI> or at <HI>Cul|ro&s;s;</HI> all which it had been mo&s;t ea&s;y for him to do; I &s;ay, had he done either of the&s;e, it had been impo&s;&s;ible that the Duke could have been &s;par'd from the Army, or have &s;pared any of his Troops for the Relief of <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> and his fail|ing in this, was not only a Di&s;appointment, but a Confirmation of what was not known till after|wards, <HI>viz.</HI> that the De&s;ign of the Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> in &s;ending over Brigadier <HI>Mackinto&s;h,</HI> was not to attack <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> but to march to the <HI>South,</HI> to encourage the Vi&s;count <HI>Kenmure,</HI> and the Friends they had on that Side; and then to march in a Body to join the <HI>Northumberland</HI> General, as they call'd him; and &s;o to march into <HI>England,</HI> to at|tempt a Diver&s;ion; and therefore in a Letter which the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> wrote to Mr. <HI>For&s;ter,</HI> which was afterwards intercepted, he calls <HI>Mac|kinto&s;h</HI>'s March to the Citadel of <HI>Leith,</HI> a wrong Step.</P>
<P>However it was, this wrong Step of the Lord <HI>Mar</HI>'s &s;av'd <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and, perhaps, all <HI>Scotland;</HI> for Brigadier <HI>Mackinto&s;h</HI> being come to <HI>Hadding|ton,</HI> had &s;uch Accounts given him of the Surprize of the Citizens of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and the dreadful Con&s;ternation the People were in; and &s;uch A&s;&s;u|rances
<PB N="148" REF="149">
given him, of the Certainty of &s;urpri&s;ing the City, that he re&s;olv'd to march directly to <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> which accordingly he did the next Day, and came to <HI>Car&s;torphen,</HI> a Village within a Mile of the City, about 6 that Evening. But not finding any Numbers come out to him, as he expected; but, on the contrary, hearing that the Citizens had &s;hut the Gates, and were in Arms to defend them&s;elves; and that a Detachment of Dragoons were expected every Minute in the Ci|ty from <HI>Sterling.</HI> The&s;e Rea&s;ons, and, which was more than all the re&s;t, his own want of &s;ufficient Numbers to force the Gates, oblig'd him to alter his March, and to turn to the Right, marching directly to the Town of <HI>Leith;</HI> which he entred, and where he immediately relea&s;ed the 45 Men, which, as I &s;aid, were taken coming over the <HI>Firth.</HI></P>
<P>Nothing is more certain, than that if they had been but 2000 more Men, he would not have fail'd of being Ma&s;ter of the Town that Night; but his whole Strength was not above 14 or 1600 Men; and yet it was the Opinion of mo&s;t Peo|ple, that if he had pu&s;h'd at it, he would have carry'd the Place; the Citizens being at that time in no Condition to have repuls'd him, and the Friends to his De&s;ign too ready to have join'd him, if he had been &s;trong enough to have made the Attempt.</P>
<P>In the Interim of all this Hurry, the Citizens of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> &s;ent away Expre&s;s upon Expre&s;s to the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> for Succour; and the Duke immediately &s;ent away 300 Dragoons to <HI>Lithgow,</HI> half way to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> to lie there till he heard again, and till he got &s;ome Light into their De|&s;ign; but when, by the very next Expre&s;s, he
<PB N="149" REF="150">
under&s;tood they were advancing to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> he comes away him&s;elf with 100 Dragoons and 200 Foot; and he was &s;o expeditious in this March, that about Two a Clock in the Morning of the 15th he came to <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> being the Morning after <HI>Mackinto&s;h</HI> with his Men was in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Leith.</HI></P>
<P>The Duke being re&s;olv'd to give the Revels no Re&s;t, having refre&s;h'd his Troops a little, who had been fatigu'd very much with a ha&s;ty March, thro' a whole Winter Night, began to draw out his little Army, which he found compos'd of &s;e|veral &s;orts of People: <HI>1&s;t,</HI> There was 400 Dra|goons, and 200 Foot, of regular Troops, on whom he could depend; there was next the New Re|giment of 400 Men, rais'd by the City, and 150 Granadiers, call'd the Town-Guard, all good for little; next there was about 500 Men of Militia Hor&s;e, and Voluntiers on Foot; but ill arm'd, and not very fit for Service, e&s;pecially the Foot.</P>
<P>With this Army the Duke march'd to <HI>Leith,</HI> where the old Brigadier, having Notice of their De&s;ign to attack him, had quitted the South Part of the Town, and was retir'd into the Citadel, where he began to fortify; and having taken &s;ix or eight &s;mall Pieces of Cannon out of &s;ome Ships in the Road, with what Powder and Ball he could find, he planted two Pieces of Cannon on the Bridge, and two more at proper Places, by the Entrance into the old Works, and prepar'd to de|fend him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Citadel of <HI>Leith</HI> is an old demoli&s;h'd Forti|fication, formerly call'd by that Name; it was built by <HI>Oliver Cromwel,</HI> to guard the Port; the Scituation is good, having the Sea on the North</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="151">
&s;ide, and the Haven and River on the Ea&s;t &s;ide, winding round Part of the South; &s;o that it was to be attack'd, when the Works were good, only on the We&s;t &s;ide, where the Country is a Plain. When this Fort was, as they call it, demoli&s;h'd, it was not done by undermining and blowing up the Works, as is now the U&s;age in &s;uch Ca&s;es; but by throwing the Top of the Lines and Ba&s;ti|ons into the Ditches, and breaking down the Gates, taking up the Bridges, and the like; by this Means the &s;olid Parts of the Works remain, and &s;o it is at <HI>Leith;</HI> nor would it require much Time or Charge to re&s;tore the Citadel to a regu|lar, compleat Fortification.</P>
<P>By this the Reader may judge, that the Works were &s;o high, and the Ditches &s;till &s;o plainly &s;een, and &s;o low, that the Port being &s;ecur'd, the Hor&s;e could be of no Service in an Attack; and the Duke being too weak in Foot for an A&s;&s;ault Sword in Hand, he &s;oon found there was no|thing to be done without more Forces, and without Cannon; &s;o he halted, and re&s;olv'd to retreat.</P>
<P>But before he did &s;o, he &s;ummon'd them to lay down their Arms, and &s;urrender, upon Pain of High Trea&s;on; declaring withal, that if they o|blig'd him to bring Cannon to force them, and they kill'd any of his Men in re&s;i&s;ting, he would give them no Quarter. However, he receiv'd a re&s;olute An&s;wer from a <HI>Highland</HI> Laird, call'd <HI>Ki|nackin;</HI> who told the Duke, that as to Surren|dring, they laugh'd at it; and as to bringing Cannon, and a&s;&s;aulting them, they were ready for him; that they would neither take or give any Quarter with him; and if he thought he was able to force them, <HI>he might try his Hand.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="152">
The Duke &s;eeing there was no good to be done with them without Cannon, and without more Foot, retir'd to <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> and immediately gave Orders for Four Pieces of Cannon to be drawn down to <HI>Leith</HI> from the Ca&s;tle, and intend|ing to make the 400 Dragoons &s;erve on Foot, he re&s;olv'd to attack them early the next Morn|ing.</P>
<P>But old <HI>Mackinto&s;h</HI> had other Things in his Head; for, having fail'd in his grand De&s;ign upon <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> he intended no more by his Re|treat into the Citadel of <HI>Leith,</HI> than to keep him|&s;elf from being oblig'd to fight with Di&s;advantage, he having no Hor&s;e; and as little therefore did he intend to &s;tay there, till he was &s;urrounded with more Forces than he was a Match for; and therefore re&s;olv'd to put an End to the Preparati|ons of the Duke of <HI>Argyle,</HI> by a &s;udden and unex|pected Retreat that &s;ame Night; for about Nine a Clock at Night, the Tide being out, and the Mouth of the Harbour being &s;o ea&s;ily pa&s;&s;able at low Tide, as &s;ometimes to be &s;carce over Shoes in Water; they went &s;ilently out of the Citadel, and not pa&s;&s;ing thro' any Part of the Town, went di|rectly down to the Sands, pa&s;s'd the Mouth of the Harbour a great way below the <HI>Peers,</HI> march|ing due Ea&s;t, clo&s;e by the Edge of the Sea, the Sands being there &s;o flat and broad, that they could neither be &s;een or heard in the Night; thus they went off with &s;uch Secrecy, and were gone &s;o far before any one had Knowledge of it, or at lea&s;t before the Duke could make any Di&s;po|&s;itions to follow them, <HI>the Night being very dark,</HI> that it was to no Purpo&s;e to think of pur&s;uing them till Morning; when Advice came to the Duke, that they had taken Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Seaton-Hou&s;e,</HI>
<PB N="152" REF="153">
the Dwelling of the Earl of <HI>Wintoun,</HI> about nine Miles from <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> a Hou&s;e &s;trong built, and wall'd round; &s;o as neither there, any more than at the Citadel of <HI>Leith,</HI> could they be at|tack'd without more Forces than the Duke had at Hand, nor without the Help of Cannon. A|bout 50 of their Men, who were drunk with Li|quor, or with Sleep, and were left in the Citadel, including 15 or 16 that were left by the Way, not able to march with the re&s;t, were brought Pri&s;oners to <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> and this was their next Halt.</P>
<P>Here being &s;ecure again for a few Days, they entrench'd the Avenues to the Hou&s;e, and forti|fy'd the Gate &s;o as not to be in Danger of Sur|prize; and &s;ent out into the Country to bring in Mutton, Cows, Salt, and Meal, which they took in &s;uch Quantities, as made the Country afraid they intended to wait there for more Men to come over the <HI>Firth</HI> to them; but they had no &s;uch View, it &s;eems; neither if they had, would it have been to any Purpo&s;e; for the Men of War, and arm'd Smacks, had &s;o &s;pread the <HI>Firth,</HI> that it was &s;carce practicable for any open &s;ingle Boat to pa&s;s them, much le&s;s a Fleet of Boats.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> finding where they were Roo&s;ted, now re&s;olv'd to give them as little Re&s;t here, as he had done at <HI>Leith;</HI> and therefore &s;ent out immediately a Detachment of Dragoons, with a Body of the Voluntier Hor&s;e, to alarm them. This Detachment came up to the Hou&s;e; but finding the Scituation and Po&s;ture of the E|nemy &s;uch, as that nothing could be attempted without more Forces, they return'd the &s;ame Night.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="154">
In the mean Time, the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> hearing of this fal&s;e Step of his Detachment, and not doubt|ing but they would be fallen upon from <HI>Sterling,</HI> took that Step now for their Deliverance, which, had he taken at fir&s;t by Concert with them, had been a fatal Blow to the Affair in general, <HI>as is noted above;</HI> for he advanc'd from <HI>Perth</HI> to <HI>Dum|blain</HI> with all his Cavalry, and 3000 Foot being order'd to follow, made a motion al&s;o in order to join him: This March of the Enemy alarm'd the Royal Army at <HI>Sterling,</HI> and they &s;ent Ex|pre&s;&s;es of it to the Duke of <HI>Argyle;</HI> who, upon this Advice, leaving the City of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> no more than 100 Dragoons, and 150 Foot, with General <HI>Wightman</HI> to defend them, went back immediately with the re&s;t of the Forces to the Camp.</P>
<P>Had the Rebels in <HI>Seaton-Hou&s;e</HI> known either of this Movement of the Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> or of the go|ing back of the Duke, they would &s;oon have taken more Freedom than they did with tho&s;e that were left. But, to amu&s;e them, the Earl of <HI>Rothes,</HI> with 300 Voluntiers, the Lord <HI>Torphichen</HI> with the 100 Dragoons which the Duke had left, and &s;ome o|ther Troops, &s;uch as they had, making in all about 600 Men, marched up to <HI>Seaton-Hou&s;e</HI> again, where old <HI>Mackinto&s;h</HI> kept him&s;elf clo&s;e in his Fortifications, which they, without Cannon, and a good Body of regular Troops, were in no Condition to attack; This was the 17th of <HI>October.</HI></P>
<P>By this Time the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> had Intelligence of the Retreat, and hearing that the Duke of <HI>Ar|gyle</HI> was come back to <HI>Sterling,</HI> he left <HI>Dumblain,</HI> and march'd back again to <HI>Perth;</HI> and thus, for five or &s;ix Days, the poor Men on both Sides were

harra&s;s'd backward and forward to little or no other Purpo&s;e than to amu&s;e and prevent one ano|ther; nor was there hardly a Mu&s;quet fir'd on all the&s;e Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>But the poor Country was left naked by this Means, and the fruitful rich Provinces of <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>Mid Lothain,</HI> the <HI>Mers, Tiveotdale,</HI> &amp;c. were un|happily left to be ravaged by a little, and other|wi&s;e a contemptible Body of 1400, or at mo&s;t 1500 Men; this the <HI>Scots</HI> complain'd loudly of; but the Circum&s;tances of Things admitted no Remedy at that Time, all the Troops being employed, and every one's Hands full.</P>
<P>Old <HI>Mackinto&s;h</HI> was now at Lei&s;ure; and indeed had his Intelligence been good at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> he would have been more &s;en&s;ible of the Advantage of his pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances; for tho' it was true, that he was not &s;trong enough to attack the City of <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> &s;o neither were they in any Condi|tion to attack him; and had he &s;ally'd out with 7 or 800 of his Men upon their Body of Hor&s;e, who were no other than private Gentlemen Vo|luntiers, except about 80 Dragoons, he would have made but too ea&s;y an Experiment of their Weakne&s;s; for though they vi&s;ited him two or three Times, and alarm'd him at <HI>Seaton-Hou&s;e,</HI> yet they were never above 600 &s;trong at a Time, or thereabouts, and among them no regular Men, or not above 100. But it &s;eems, the Brigadier did not know that the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> was gone back to <HI>Sterling,</HI> or that the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> had made any Motion in his Favour; otherwi&s;e he might have in&s;ulted them again at the Gates of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> as often as he had plea&s;ed; but he expecting every Day to be inve&s;ted, and Cannon to be brought down again&s;t him, very happily for the City of
<PB N="155" REF="156">
<HI>Edinburgh,</HI> though unluckily for him, re&s;olved to pur&s;ue his fir&s;t Direction, <HI>viz.</HI> to march towards the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Border, and join that Body of Men who were ri&s;en in <HI>Dumfreis&s;hire,</HI> under the Vi&s;count <HI>Kenmure;</HI> with whom were the Earls of <HI>Nithi&s;|dale, Winton,</HI> and <HI>Carnwarth,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Nairn,</HI> with Abundance of Gentlemen of Quality; &s;uch as Lord <HI>Murray,</HI> Son to the Duke of <HI>Athol;</HI> the Ma&s;ter of <HI>Nairn,</HI> elde&s;t Son to the Lord <HI>Nairn,</HI> and &s;everal others. The&s;e being at fir&s;t &s;aid to be 300 Hor&s;e, were advanc'd to <HI>Moffat,</HI> in Pur|&s;uit of a De&s;ign to intercept the Marquis of <HI>Anan|dale,</HI> and very narrowly mi&s;s'd him; and having fail'd of that De&s;ign, lay about <HI>Moffat,</HI> expecting to hear from their Brethren in the Rebellion in <HI>Northumberland,</HI> who, about this Time al&s;o, as we had ob&s;erv'd before, were march'd from <HI>Hex|am</HI> to <HI>Morpeth,</HI> and now advanc'd to the Border, and entering <HI>Scotland,</HI> cro&s;s'd the <HI>Tweed</HI> at <HI>Kel&s;o,</HI> where &s;oon after they all met; for Brigadier <HI>Mackinto&s;h</HI> quitting <HI>Seaton-Hou&s;e</HI> on the 19th, march'd to <HI>Duns,</HI> within &s;ix Miles of <HI>Berwick,</HI> the &s;ame Day that the <HI>Northumberland</HI> Men came to <HI>Morpeth;</HI> where he lay two or three Days; and from whence, on the 22d, they march'd to <HI>Kel&s;o,</HI> where they were all in one Day join'd by the Vi&s;count of <HI>Kenmure</HI> with his Body from the <HI>We&s;t</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and by the new General <HI>For&s;ter,</HI> and the <HI>Northumberland</HI> Men, from the Border; and thus we have brought them all into one Body, making, as was reported by the mo&s;t exact Ac|counts, about 2300 Men.</P>
<P>The Rebellion was now come to a Head, and the two Principal Bodies of them being thus drawn together from all Parts, began to look for|midable: Nor indeed were they to be di&s;pi&s;ed, had
<PB N="156" REF="157">
they been well directed; for they mi&s;carried in no Part of their Undertaking, but for want of Council, and want of Intelligence: Not taking right Mea&s;ures, as they them&s;elves acknowledg'd afterwards, when they could look back, and cooly reflect upon their Mi&s;takes.</P>
<P>I have not Room here to trace every Step of the Parties which drew together to Form the&s;e Bodies; as particularly, of General <HI>Gordon</HI> with the <HI>Highlanders</HI> from the Side of <HI>Inverary;</HI> the Lord <HI>Kenmure</HI> with a Body of Gentlemen from the Side of <HI>Dumfries;</HI> and the like: But I ha&s;ten to the General Action, when all Parties made up their Strength, and brought it to a Day with this remarkable Circum&s;tances, that it was a Day in|deed; for the Battle at <HI>Sherriff Muir</HI> or <HI>Dumblain,</HI> and that at <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI> in <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> were fought on the very &s;ame Day, as will appear by and by.</P>
<P>To bring them then to Action, I return to the <HI>Northumberland</HI> Men, who being marcht up to the Border of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as before, were joined at <HI>Kel&s;o</HI> upon the <HI>Tweed,</HI> by the <HI>Scots</HI> Gentlemen un|der the Lord <HI>Kenmure,</HI> and by the Forces which pa&s;s'd the <HI>Firth</HI> with old Brigadier <HI>Mackin|to&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>Here, being in Council what to do, and hear|ing that General <HI>Carpenter</HI> advanced towards them with three Regiments of Dragoons and one of Foot, they re&s;olved to march to the South. It had been propo&s;ed to march into the We&s;t of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which had, without doubt, been very much to their Advantage, as they were &s;trong e|nough to have forced their way, and perhaps have at la&s;t opened a Way to the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> to have join'd them, or el&s;e have &s;urrounded the
<PB N="157" REF="158">
Royal Army at <HI>Stirling:</HI> But Fate and Engli&s;h Councils prevail'd.</P>
<P>Having re&s;olv'd to march for <HI>England,</HI> and at|tack General <HI>Carpenter,</HI> who in all had not above 700 Men with him, they accordingly advanced from <HI>Kel&s;o</HI> on the 27th of <HI>October,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ing the River, march'd to <HI>Jedburgh.</HI> It is true, this was not the way to attack General <HI>Carpenter,</HI> who lay at <HI>Wooller,</HI> about 12 Miles from <HI>Kel&s;o:</HI> But it &s;eems they had altered their Mind, <HI>and fatally for them it was;</HI> for had they boldly attack'd Gene|ral <HI>Carpenter,</HI> they would have gone fair to have defeated him, his Number being &s;o &s;mall, and the Battalion of Foot which he had un|der his Command not being come up at that time.</P>
<P>They Halted at <HI>Jedburgh</HI> two Days, con&s;idering what Cour&s;e to take: Three ways offered to them; one was Marching into the We&s;t of <HI>Scot|land,</HI> the other attacking General <HI>Carpenter,</HI> the third was Marching into <HI>England;</HI> and this la&s;t they cho&s;e, though the wor&s;t of the three.</P>
<P>The <HI>Highlanders</HI> and &s;ome of the <HI>Scots</HI> Gentle|men, e&s;pecially the Earl of <HI>Winton,</HI> urged the Fir&s;t with &s;tronge Arguments, and &s;o Embarked the <HI>Highlanders</HI> in it, that when other Mea&s;ures were re&s;olv'd on, they Mutiny'd, and would not march. His Scheme was, to cro&s;s the <HI>We&s;tern Dales,</HI> and join the <HI>Clans</HI> about the <HI>Scour&s;e</HI> of <HI>Forth;</HI> or to &s;end Word to the Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> that they would fall upon the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI>'s Rear, while he advancing they might &s;urround and defeat him, his Number being at that time but very &s;mall.</P>
<P>This was &s;o good a Scheme in it &s;elf, and &s;o well argued by the <HI>Scots</HI> Noblemen, that when
<PB N="158" REF="159">
the other Re&s;olutions were taken, at the pre&s;&s;ing de&s;ire of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nobility, the <HI>Scots Highlanders</HI> re&s;olved that they would not pa&s;s the Border; but if it was in&s;i&s;ted on, they would &s;eparate, and go back into <HI>Scotland;</HI> however, as they re&s;olv'd to keep together to the Borders, they march'd from <HI>Jedburgh</HI> to <HI>Langholm.</HI></P>
<P>It was on this March that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Lords re&s;olving to march for <HI>England,</HI> they recalled a &s;trong Detachment made to attack <HI>Dumfreis,</HI> and then drew up at <HI>Howick Moor,</HI> and held another Council of War, where the <HI>Highlanders</HI> refu&s;ed to march, unle&s;s it was to attack General <HI>Carpenter;</HI> nor was this Mutiny ever appea&s;ed, but the <HI>High|landers</HI> po&s;itively in&s;i&s;ting, and not to be prevail'd with to &s;tir over the Border, 500 of them &s;epara|ted into &s;mall Bodies, and went off, re&s;olving to &s;urrender them&s;elves to the King's Troops; which they did, and were for &s;ome Months after kept Pri&s;oners at <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> and at <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> but at length relea&s;ed.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the <HI>Highlanders</HI> being, by Per&s;wa|&s;ions, and &s;ome Money given them, prevailed with to keep together, they all took Re&s;olution to give General <HI>Carpenter</HI> the &s;lip, and to march for <HI>England,</HI> having, as they plainly &s;aw, the ad|vantage, by their Scituation, of three Days march of him: With the&s;e Re&s;olutions, and the Hopes of a great In&s;urrection in <HI>England</HI> to favour their De&s;igns, they decamped from <HI>Howick,</HI> and by a very long and &s;wift March reached to <HI>Longtoun</HI> that Night, which is within Seven Miles of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Border, leaving the Four Pieces of Can|non they had with them at <HI>Langholm,</HI> that they might not retard them in their March.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="160">
Next Day, the 30th of <HI>October,</HI> they entred <HI>England,</HI> and march'd to <HI>Brampton</HI> and <HI>Cumber|land.</HI> Here Mr. <HI>For&s;ter</HI> opened his Commi&s;&s;ion from the <HI>Pretender,</HI> empowering him to act as General in <HI>England;</HI> and, the <HI>Highlanders</HI> were from this time regularly paid as Soldiers Six-pence a Day.</P>
<P>They halted one Night at <HI>Brampton,</HI> to refre&s;h the Men after their hard Marches, having march'd above 100 Miles in five Days. The next Day they advanced towards <HI>Penrith:</HI> They expected to have met with &s;ome Friends here to join them; for it was reported that Mr. <HI>Dacre</HI> of <HI>Ab|beylanner-Coa&s;t,</HI> a Papi&s;t, had promi&s;ed to rai&s;e 40 Men; but he was taken with a fortunate Fe|ver, which hindred him of his De&s;ign, and pre|vented him and his Family from Ruin: He died &s;ince; his Name, which was very ancient, is now extinct in that E&s;tate. As they drew near <HI>Penrith,</HI> they had notice that the Sheriff, with the <HI>Po&s;&s;e Comitatus,</HI> were got together, with the Lord <HI>Lon&s;dale,</HI> and the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> to the Number of 14000 Men, who re&s;olved to &s;tand and oppo&s;e their penetrating farther into <HI>England.</HI> The fir&s;t Part of this was very true, <HI>viz.</HI> that the <HI>Po&s;&s;e</HI> was drawn together, nor was their Number much le&s;s. But they gave the <HI>Highland</HI> Army no occa&s;ion to try whether they would &s;tand or no; for as &s;oon as a Party, who the Country People &s;ent but for Di&s;covery, had &s;een &s;ome of the Men coming out of a Lane by the &s;ide of a Wood, and draw up upon a Moor, and then ad|vance, and that they had carried an Account of this to their Main Body, they broke up their Camp in the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion, &s;hifting every one for them&s;elves as well as they could, as is gene|rally

the Ca&s;e of an arm'd, but undi&s;ciplin'd Mul|titude.</P>
<P>On the 5th they came to <HI>Appleby,</HI> having be|hav'd them&s;elves very well to the Country in ge|neral, on their March; for I do not hear of any extraordinary Violences they exerci&s;ed to any People on the way; the mo&s;t Mi&s;chief I hear of, was, (1.) The taking up the Publick Moneys; &s;uch as the Exci&s;e, Land-Tax, and all the Mo|ney belonging to the Publick Revenues, that they could meet with; which was, in the whole, very con&s;iderable too. (2.) The taking what Arms, Ammunition, and Hor&s;es, they could meet with, which were fit for Service.</P>
<P>The&s;e were Things which might indeed be ex|pected from Men in Arms again&s;t the Govern|ment; but as to other Violences, &s;uch as Burn|ings, Plunderings, Murthers, Rapes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the u&s;ual Practice in like Ca&s;es, where the Soldiery are under no Di&s;cipline, I do not find that they have been charg'd with any: And the Account pub|li&s;hed by one of their own Party, &s;ince turn'd a|bout, acknowledges, that it having been moved to Mr. <HI>For&s;ter</HI> to Burn the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Meeting-Hou&s;e at <HI>Perth,</HI> he forbid it, and &s;aid, <HI>They were to Conquer by Clemency, not by Cruelty.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Appleby</HI> they advanced to <HI>Kendal,</HI> from thence to <HI>Kirkby Launsdale,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Lanca&s;ter;</HI> and having thus pu&s;h'd near Four|&s;core Miles into the Country, without fighting, they were greatly encouraged, and their Friends began now to appear and join them.</P>
<P>At <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> they &s;eized at the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e &s;ome &s;mall Arms, with a quantity of Wine and Brandy, which was divided among the Soldiers; they al&s;o took Six Pieces of Cannon out of a Ship
<PB N="161" REF="162">
in the River. Being pretty much encrea&s;ed by the Addition of &s;everal Gentlemen, and their Servants and Attendants, they re&s;olv'd to ad|vance to <HI>Manche&s;ter,</HI> where they expected great Numbers to join them; and which, had they not been prevented by the coming in of the King's Troops, would certainly have been &s;o, as I &s;hall &s;oon ob&s;erve.</P>
<P>Here it is ob&s;erved, that if they had &s;taid at <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> a Place &s;trong by Situation, they had not only encrea&s;ed their Strength, and been well &s;upplied with many things they wanted, but they could not have been attack'd, as they were, without Cannon: Nor had they been wor&s;ted, would they have been obliged to &s;o an entire Surrender; but might either have made better Terms for them&s;elves, or have made their E&s;capes by Sea.</P>
<P>But Fate and their own Mi&s;takes hurry'd them on; and on the Ninth of <HI>November</HI> they march'd for <HI>Pre&s;ton,</HI> having fir&s;t relea&s;ed &s;ome of their Friends who had been confin'd in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> by Virtue of the late Act of Parlia|ment mentioned before. Their De&s;ign now was plain; <HI>(viz.)</HI> to &s;eize upon the Pa&s;s of <HI>Warrington</HI> Bridge, and the Town of <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI> there.</P>
<P>The 10th they entred <HI>Pre&s;ton,</HI> and ended their March; for they were pre&s;ently informed here, that the King's Troops were advancing to attack them; this was on the 12th; upon this News they alter'd their Re&s;olution of marching to <HI>Bol|ton,</HI> as they had before intended, and re&s;olved to fortify them&s;elves in the Po&s;t they were in, and expect the King's Troops there.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="163">
The Alarm being now given, a Body of their Foot marched out of the Town as far as <HI>Ribble-Bridge,</HI> po&s;ting them&s;elves there, and Mr. <HI>For&s;ter,</HI> with a Party of Hor&s;e, went beyond it to get a certain Account of Things; when di&s;|covering the Vanguard of the Dragoons, he re|turned another Way, not coming back by the Bridge; but &s;ent with all ha&s;t to give an Account of the Approach of the King's Army, and to give Orders to prepare to receive them, whil&s;t he went to view a Ford in the River, in order for a Pa&s;&s;age to come behind them. The Foot that were advanced to the Bridge were about an 100; but they were choice, &s;tout, and well-armed Men, and commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel <HI>John Farquhar&s;on</HI> of <HI>Innercall,</HI> belonging to <HI>Mac|kinto&s;h</HI>'s Battalion: He was a good Officer and a very bold Man, and would have defended that important Pa&s;s of the Bridge to the la&s;t Drop, and till the re&s;t had advanced and drawn them|&s;elves out of the Town; but he was order'd to retreat to <HI>Pre&s;ton:</HI> This Retreat was another wrong &s;tep, and has been condemned on all hands as one of the greate&s;t Over&s;ights they could be guilty of; for the River is not fordable but a good Way above and below the Bridge, which they might have made impa&s;&s;able al&s;o, by &s;everal Methods practi&s;ed on like Occa&s;ions. As for the Bridge, they might have barricado'd it &s;o well, that it would have been impracticable to have pa&s;s'd there, or to have di&s;lodged them from it; al&s;o they had Cannon, which General <HI>Wills</HI> wanted: And here alone indeed it might be &s;aid they were in a Condition to have made an effectual Stand; for here the King's Forces would have been entirely expo&s;ed to their Fire, having
<PB N="163" REF="164">
no Cover; whereas the Rebels could have very much &s;ecured them&s;elves again&s;t the other's Fire, by the Bridge, and by the Ri&s;ing-Ground near it. General <HI>Wills</HI> did indeed expect &s;ome Difficulty and Oppo&s;ition at this Place, believing, by their Situation, that the Rebels would have made their greate&s;t Effort at that Place; but under|&s;tanding by his Advance-Guard that the Rebels had abandon'd that Po&s;t, he was &s;urprized, and &s;u&s;pected that then they had &s;ome Stratagem in hand, and perhaps had lined the Hedges, and &s;o made the Lane unpa&s;&s;able for his Men. The Lane is indeed very deep, and &s;o narrow that in &s;everal Places two Men cannot ride abrea&s;t. Ge|neral <HI>Wills,</HI> on tho&s;e Suppo&s;itions, proceeded with Caution, and cau&s;ed the Hedges and Fields to be view'd, and the Ways laid open for his Caval|ry to enter; but finding the Hedges al&s;o clear, he concluded then, that the Enemy was fled, and expected that they had abandon'd the Town and all, and would endeavour by long Marches to re|turn to <HI>Scotland,</HI> tho' he thought it impo&s;&s;ible for them to do that too: But he &s;oon under&s;tood that they were retreated to the Town only, and that they re&s;olv'd to receive him there with a re|&s;olute Countenance; &s;o he had nothing to do but to prepare for the Attack, which he went about immediately. Having advanced nearer the Town, he ordered his Troops to pa&s;s at a Gate which leads into the Fields which lie on the back of the Town, and immediately &s;preading the Enclo&s;ures with the utmo&s;t Expedition and Diligence, &s;o di&s;po&s;ed of his Forces as be&s;t to be able both to attack them in the Town, and to prevent them from Sallying or making a Re|treat.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="165">
During this time, they were not idle in the Town, nor did they appear in the lea&s;t di&s;coura|ged, but applied them&s;elves re&s;olutely to their Bu&s;ine&s;s, barrocading the Streets, and po&s;ting their Men there, and in the bye-Lanes, and Hou&s;es, to the greate&s;t Advantage, for all Events. The Gentlemen-Voluntiers were drawn up in the Church-yard, under the Command of the Earl of <HI>Derwentwater,</HI> Vi&s;count <HI>Kenmure,</HI> Earls of <HI>Win|toun</HI> and <HI>Nith&s;dale.</HI> The Earl of <HI>Derwentwater</HI> &s;ignally behav'd, having &s;tript into his Wa&s;tcoat, and encouraged the Men, by giving them Money to ca&s;t up Trenches, and animating them to a vigorous Defence of them. They form'd Four main Barriers; one a little below the Church, commanded by Brigadier <HI>Mackinto&s;h;</HI> the Gentle|men in the Church-yard were to &s;upport that Bar|rier in particular, and Lord <HI>Charles Murray</HI> that which was at the End of a Lane leading to the Fields: The third Barrier was called the Wind-mill; this was commanded by Colonel <HI>Mackin|to&s;h:</HI> And the Fourth was in the Street which leads towards <HI>Liverpool,</HI> commanded by Major <HI>Miller</HI> and Mr. <HI>Dougla&s;s.</HI> The three former were all attack'd with great Fury by the King's For|ces: The fir&s;t Attack was made upon the Barrier below the Church, commanded by Brigadier <HI>Mackinto&s;h;</HI> but they met with &s;uch a Reception, and &s;o terrible a Fire was made upon them, as well from the Barricado as from the Hou&s;es on both &s;ides, that they were obliged to retreat back to the Entrance of the Town. During the Heat of this Action, &s;ome of <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI>'s Officers being inform'd that the Street leading to <HI>Wigan</HI> was not barricado'd, and that the Hou&s;es were not po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed on that &s;ide, they pre&s;ently entred that Street
<PB N="165" REF="166">
with great Bravery, pu&s;hing all before them <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI>'s Regiment of Foot were commanded up|on this Service, &s;upported by <HI>Honnywood</HI>'s Dra|goons. It is true, Mr. <HI>For&s;ter</HI> had at fir&s;t taken Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that Street, and po&s;ted Men in the Hou&s;es on both &s;ides; but they were, again&s;t their Inclination, called off to other Service; nor were they left, as &s;ome de&s;ir'd, to po&s;t them&s;elves at the extreame&s;t Ends of the Town, even at that End which leads to the Bridge, where the fir&s;t and hotte&s;t Attack was made. Several Hou&s;es were left, particularly one which belonged to Sir <HI>Henry Haughton:</HI> Captain <HI>Innis</HI> with Fifty High|landers had taken Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this Hou&s;e; and had he been allowed to have continued there, he might have given a good Account of it; but he al&s;o was call'd off from that Po&s;t, &s;ome of <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI>'s Men got Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that too, tho' it co&s;t them dear, for many of their Men were kill'd there from other Hou&s;es. It is a high Hou&s;e, over|looking the whole Town: There was al&s;o ano|ther Hou&s;e oppo&s;ite to it, which they entred, and po&s;ted &s;everal of their Men in it. And from the&s;e two Hou&s;es came almo&s;t all the Lo&s;s the Northern People &s;u&s;tained during the Action. Mr. <HI>For&s;ter</HI> cannot be blamed for this Over&s;ight, but it mu&s;t be charged upon the Brigadier, who a little while before <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI>'s Foot made this brave and bold Attack, withdrew his Men from tho&s;e Hou&s;es. The Attack was thus, <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI>'s Men, led by their Lieutenant-Colonel the Lord <HI>Fore&s;ter,</HI> did not come up to the Head of the Street, but marched in|to a &s;traight Pa&s;&s;age behind the Hou&s;es, and then made a Halt 'till their Lieutenant-Colonel the Lord <HI>Fore&s;ter</HI> came into the open Street with his drawn Sword in his Hand, and faced <HI>Mackinto&s;h</HI>'s
<PB N="166" REF="167">
Barrier, looking up and down the Street, and viewing how they were po&s;ted. There were ma|ny Shots fired at him, but he returned to his Men, and came up again at the Head of them into the middle Street, where he cau&s;ed &s;ome to face the Barricade where the Brigadier was po&s;t|ed, and ply them with their Shot, at the &s;ame time commanding another Party to march cro&s;s the Streets, to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e Hou&s;es. Whil&s;t this was doing, the other from the Bar|rier, and from the Hou&s;es on both &s;ides, made a terrible Fire upon them, and a great many of that old and gailant Regiment were killed and wound|ed: The Lord <HI>Fore&s;ter</HI> received &s;everal Wounds him&s;elf. Be&s;ides the Damage they received on that &s;ide, they were &s;ore galled from &s;ome Windows below them, by Captain <HI>Dougla&s;s</HI> and Captain <HI>Hunter</HI>'s Men. <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI>'s Foot fired &s;martly upon the Barrier, but did little Execution, the Men being generally cover'd from the Shot, and deli|vering their own Shot &s;ecurely, and with good Aim; yet &s;ome were kill'd, and &s;ome al&s;o wound|ed, particularly two very gallant Gentlemen were wounded here, and both dy'd of their Wounds; the one was Captain <HI>Peter Farquhar&s;on</HI> of <HI>Rochaley,</HI> a Gentleman of an invincible Spirit, and almo&s;t inimitable Bravery. This Gentleman being &s;hot through the Bone of the Leg, endured a great deal of Torture in the Operation of the Surgeon. When he was fir&s;t brought into the Inn call'd the <HI>White Bull,</HI> the Hou&s;e where all the wounded Men were carry'd to be dre&s;s'd, he took a Gla&s;s of Brandy, and &s;aid, <HI>Come, Lads, here is your Ma|&s;ter's Health; though I can do no more, I wi&s;h you good Succe&s;s.</HI> His Leg was cut off by one who I may call a Butcher, rather than a Surgeon, and
<PB N="167" REF="168">
he pre&s;ently died. The other was Mr. <HI>Clifton,</HI> Brother to Sir <HI>Jervas Clifton,</HI> he was al&s;o a gal|lant and throughly accompli&s;h'd Gentleman; he receiv'd a &s;hot in the Knee, of which he died &s;ome Hours after. There was another Gentle|man call'd Colonel <HI>Brereton,</HI> who had formerly &s;erv'd in the Army; he had many Wounds, one of which, by the va&s;t Flux of Blood, was not di&s;cover'd &s;oon enough by his Surgeon, or el&s;e it's thought he might have outliv'd his Fate that Day: After he was bury'd, he was ta|ken out of his Grave, to &s;atisfie the Curio&s;ity of a Commanding Officer, who could not be per|&s;waded that this Gentleman was in the Rebel|lion.</P>
<P>The next Barrier which was attack'd, was commanded by Lord <HI>Charles Murray:</HI> He behav'd very gallantly, but being vigorou&s;ly attack'd, wanted Men, and &s;ent to the Earl of <HI>Derwent|water</HI> for Help, who immediately &s;ent him a Re|lief of 50 Gentlemen Voluntiers from the Church|yard to reinforce him, who came in very &s;ea&s;ona|bly. Immediately Par&s;on <HI>Patten</HI> was order'd over the Barrier to view the King's Forces, who ap|pearing in a Clergyman's Habit, was not &s;u&s;pe|cted, nor fired at. He &s;oon returned back, and gave Lord <HI>Charles</HI> an Account, that by what he &s;aw, they were re&s;olved to attack him again; whereupon Lord <HI>Charles</HI> gave Orders to his Men to be ready to receive them: Accordingly they came on very furiou&s;ly, and tho' the King's Forces that made this Attack, were, for the mo&s;t part, raw, new-li&s;ted Men, and &s;eem'd unwil|ling to fight; yet the Bravery and good Conduct of experienc'd Officers &s;upply'd very much that Defect. However, Lord <HI>Charles Murray</HI> main|tain'd
<PB N="168" REF="169">
the Po&s;t, and oblig'd them to retreat with Lo&s;s; nor, had they been all old Soldiers, could they have beaten Lord <HI>Charles</HI> from that Barrier, which was very &s;trong; the Number they had &s;lain from the Barn-holes and Barrier it &s;elf added very much, &s;o that at la&s;t the Officers them&s;elves thought fit to give it over.</P>
<P>The third Attack was at the Windmill in the Street which leads to <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> where the Barri|er was defended by near 300 Men, under the Command of Mr. <HI>Mackinto&s;h,</HI> who, with his Men, behaved very boldly, and made a dreadful Fire upon the King's Forces, killing many on the &s;pot, and obliging them to make a Retreat; which, however, they did very hand&s;omely. This was owing to the Common Men, who were but new|li&s;ted; tho' the Officers and old Soldiers behav'd them&s;elves with great Bravery.</P>
<P>Hitherto the Rebels &s;eem'd to have had &s;ome Advantage, having repul&s;ed the King's Forces in all their Attacks, and maintained all their Po&s;ts; and Night drawing on, no new Action happen'd; but during all this time, and all <HI>Saturday</HI> Night, and <HI>Sunday,</HI> and good part of that Night, the King's Forces kept ince&s;&s;antly Plattoons firing up|on them, from Sir <HI>Henry Haughton</HI>'s and Mr. <HI>Ayre</HI>'s Hou&s;es. It's true, they kill'd but very few; tho&s;e of Note were, one Mr. <HI>Hume</HI> a Cornet, one Mr. <HI>Scattery,</HI> and a Highland Gentleman belong|ing to the Lord <HI>Nairn.</HI> There were &s;everal Hou|&s;es and Barns &s;et on fire by both Parties, both for covering them&s;elves among the Smoak, and di&s;lodging Men; &s;o that if the Wind had blown almo&s;t from any Quarter, the whole Town had been burnt to the Ground, and the Men had been burnt to A&s;hes in it.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="170">
But the wi&s;er Heads among them began now to &s;ee that they were not able to carry it on, or to defend them&s;elves long in this Situation; and that which was yet more, their Ammunition began to fail them, having not above one Barrel of Powder left.</P>
<P>The Heads of them therefore began to think of Capitulating, and met together at Night to that Purpo&s;e; the Lord <HI>Widdrington,</HI> Col. <HI>Oxburgh,</HI> and &s;ome others, entred into a Con&s;ultation about it; the Re&s;ult of which was, that Col. <HI>Oxburgh</HI> was &s;ent out to treat.</P>
<P>The <HI>Highlanders,</HI> to give them their Due, &s;corn'd the very Name of a Surrender, and de|manded to &s;ally out, and die like Men of Honour, with their Swords in their Hands; but they were made believe, that General <HI>Wills</HI> had &s;ent and of|fer'd them honourable Conditions.</P>
<P>When the Colonel came to General <HI>Wills,</HI> he was received re&s;pectively, as to his Per&s;on; but was told po&s;itively, that there was no room to Treat, and that they had nothing to do but to Surrender at Di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>The Colonel urg'd it very hard, and &s;ometimes in&s;i&s;ted, that they were not reduced to &s;uch a Con|dition; that they had their Arms in their hands, and knew how to die like Men of Honour, and to &s;ell their Lives dear enough. The General told them, That they had nothing more to do than to prepare for it; and the Con&s;equence &s;hould be, that he would not give one Man of them Quarter.</P>
<P>The Colonel in&s;i&s;ted then, that the General would promi&s;e their Lives &s;hould be &s;par'd; which the General, it is &s;aid, denied; but encouraged them to expect his Maje&s;ty's Clemency.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="171">
I know there has been a Di&s;pute in this Ca&s;e; the one &s;ide claiming Life, as the natural Con&s;e|quence of a Surrender to Mercy; the other deny|ing it: Nor can I pretend to decide it here. The Matter of Fact was no other but this, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That Colonel <HI>Oxburgh</HI> finding no better Bargain could be made for them, agreed at la&s;t to yield at Di&s;|cretion; which was done.</P>
<P>The Common Soldiers were in a great Rage at the Thoughts of a Surrender, and all was in a Tumult for &s;ome time; nay, two or three were &s;hot Dead by them, for but mentioning it. But there was no Remedy; the Gentlemen had con|&s;ented, and the re&s;t were obliged to &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>At the Time appointed therefore, which was at Seven the next Morning, the two Generals en|tred the Town in form, at the Head of their Troops, with Trumpets &s;ounding, and Drums beating. They came in at &s;everal Streets, from the Places they were po&s;ted at, and all met in the Market-place, where the <HI>Highlanders</HI> &s;tood drawn up in very good Order, with their Arms. The Noblemen and Gentlemen immediately put them|&s;elves into their Hands, and were &s;ecured in &s;eve|ral Inns in the Town. Then the <HI>Highlanders</HI> were Commanded to lay down their Arms; which they did, and were &s;ecured in the Church, under a &s;trong Guard, where their Accommodation was indeed but very indifferent; but it did not la&s;t long.</P>
<P>Thus ended this Affair. The Lo&s;s on both Sides was then ca&s;t up. Of the King's Troops, there was a great many Officers wounded, as Brigadier <HI>Honnywood,</HI> Brigadier <HI>Dormer,</HI> Lieuten|ant-Colonel Lord <HI>Fore&s;ter,</HI> Major <HI>Bland,</HI> Captain <HI>Ogleby,</HI> Major <HI>Law&s;on,</HI> be&s;ides 3 Captains, 2 Lieutenants, 1 Cornet, and 4 En&s;igns.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="172">
Among the &s;lain were, 1 Major, who&s;e Name was <HI>Pre&s;ton.</HI> And of <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI>'s Regiment, 3 Cap|tains, 1 En&s;ign, and about 220 Private Men.</P>
<P>Of the others, only 17 kill'd, and 25 wound|ed.</P>
<P>The Pri&s;oners amounted to 7 Lords, and 1489 Gentlemen and Private Solders. The Noblemen were, the Earl of <HI>Derwentwater,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Nith&s;dale,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Winton,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Carn|warth,</HI> Vi&s;count <HI>Kenmure,</HI> the Lord <HI>Widdrington,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Nairn.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Fate of the&s;e Gentlemen, it will be the Subject of the next Year's Account.</P>
<P>They were now drawing together in <HI>Scotland</HI> al&s;o, and Things ripened up for Action on that &s;ide too.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Account we had of the Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> was, that being joined by all the Troops he had to expect, the <HI>Clans</HI> under General <HI>Gordon</HI> only excepted, who were al&s;o ready to join him on a March, he was now preparing to decamp, and make his grand Attempt for pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Forth,</HI> and entring the South of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in order to &s;up|port his other Adherents, and carry the War into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>To this Purpo&s;e, he &s;ummon'd all his Forces together; and calling a great Council of War at <HI>Perth,</HI> where all their Mea&s;ures were concerted, he left Colonel <HI>Balfour</HI> Governor of the Town, and march'd the 10th of <HI>November</HI> to <HI>Auchterarder,</HI> about 9 M$$s from <HI>Perth,</HI> in order to draw his Army together, and &s;ettle the Order of Battle, as well as their Order of Marching: He had with him, if we may credit their own Report, 2300 Hor&s;e, and 5000 Foot, be&s;ides 3000 Foot which
<PB N="172" REF="173">
join'd him the next Day; &s;o that his Army con|&s;i&s;ted of 10300 effective Men at the Time of the Battle: Only that they tell us, that 800 Men, whereof 400 were Hor&s;e, were drawn up as a Re&s;erve on the other Side of the River, and ne|ver came into Action.</P>
<P>It is plain, the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> had no Expectation of being oblig'd to fight &s;o &s;oon, or that the Duke of <HI>Argyle,</HI> who&s;e Forces were &s;o much inferior in Number, would meet him half Way to give him Battle; and therefore, when the Royal Army ap|pear'd, they had their Re&s;olutions to deliberate; and calling a Council of War in the Field, it was unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved among them to fight, and, indeed, to begin the Attack.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> was not at all in any Un|certainty; for when he had fir&s;t an Account of the Enemy being advanc'd from <HI>Perth</HI> with his whole Army, Cannon, and Bread-Waggons, in which it was &s;aid he carried Provi&s;ions for 12 Days, it was ea&s;y to make a Judgment what his Intention was; and therefore the Duke re&s;olving not to &s;uffer him to di&s;pute his Pa&s;&s;age in Places inacce&s;&s;able to the Hor&s;e, and where they could be of no U&s;e in Battle, the Hor&s;e being the only Advantage he had, he pa&s;&s;ed the River at the Bridge of <HI>Sterling</HI> the 12th, with his whole Army, con&s;i&s;ting but of 3500 Men, whereof about 1200 were Dragoons, all very good Troops, and com|manded by experienc'd Officers, and advanced that Night to <HI>Dumblain.</HI></P>
<P>The Enemy was at <HI>Ardoch,</HI> about 4 Miles di|&s;tance, and had, by their Countenance, &s;eem'd as re&s;olv'd for Action as the other, having given Signals, by firing three Pieces of Cannon that E|vening, for all their Troops to a&s;&s;emble; which
<PB N="173" REF="174">
being done, they advanc'd in Order of Battle the &s;ame Night, within about a Mile and half of the Royal Army, where they lay upon their Arms all Night, as the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI>'s Men did al&s;o.</P>
<P>On the 13th, by Break of Day, both Armies were again in Motion; and the Duke advancing to a Ri&s;ing-Ground, a little before his Front, could ea&s;ily di&s;cern the Enemy's Army in full March, tho' another Hill on his Left intercepted the Sight, &s;o as that the Point of their Left Wing could not be di&s;cern'd; nor could he gue&s;s at the Extent of their Line for the &s;ame Rea&s;on, or how far they out-flank'd him. The Royal Army was drawn up upon the Hights above <HI>Dumblain,</HI> to the North-Ea&s;t of the Town, having the Town on his Left, at the Di&s;tance of about a Mile and half, and a wet boggy Moor, call'd <HI>Sherriffmoor,</HI> on his Right; which Moor was u&s;ually unpa&s;&s;able for the Cavalry, and was thought to be &s;o then, only that a light Fro&s;t, which happen'd the two or three preceding Nights, had made it able to bear; and this the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> it &s;eems knew, and therefore extended his Lines to take the Royal Army in Front and Flank, marching his Men di|rectly over the Moor. This cau&s;ed the Duke to alter the whole Di&s;po&s;ition of his Front to meet the Enemy, and prevent one Part of his Men be|ing &s;urrounded; and this occa&s;ion'd the Di&s;or|der on the Left, and gave the Enemy an Opportu|nity to charge them before they were fully form'd, as &s;hall appear pre&s;ently: For to &s;ay the Enemy's Army, who had march'd in Order of Battle above a Mile, &s;hould be ready to charge the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI>'s Army before they were form'd, if that unfore&s;een Incident had not oblig'd him to change
<PB N="174" REF="175">
the Di&s;po&s;itions he had made, would be to &s;ay, the Rebels under&s;tood their Bu&s;ine&s;s better than the King's General, which no body will pretend to. However it was, this is certain, that when the Royal Army, after the changing their Front as above, began to advance, and came up to the Ri&s;ing Grounds, where the Enemy fir&s;t appear'd, advancing al&s;o; they found them&s;elves within Pi&s;tol-&s;hot of the Enemy's Right, and heard their Bagpipes playing a great Way farther to the Left than the King's Line extended.</P>
<P>The Order of Battle of the Royal Army was thus: The fir&s;t Line con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ix Battalions of Foot, all old Troops; but the Battalions being upon the reduc'd E&s;tabli&s;hment, were but thin, not exceeding 300 Men each; the Right Wing con&s;i&s;ted of three Squadrons of Dragoons, the choice&s;t of the Army; and the Left likewi&s;e of three Squadrons: The &s;econd Line con&s;i&s;ted of two Battalions of Foot, and two Squadrons of Dragoons, in each Wing. The Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> was on the Right, at the Head of the Dragoons of <HI>Stairs</HI> and <HI>Evans:</HI> Brigadier <HI>Morri&s;on</HI> had the Left; and Major-General <HI>Wightman</HI> commanded in the Center, or main Battle. Nor was it a &s;mall Lo&s;s that, in this Action, there was &s;o great a Want of General Officers.</P>
<P>The Order of Battle of the Enemy, as we have it from their own Accounts, and from &s;ome of the Pri&s;oners, who were taken in the Action, was thus: They were drawn up in two Lines, as fol|lows: The Foot of the fir&s;t Line, drawn up in 10 Battalions, but of unequal Numbers, form'd the main Battle, making about 4000 Men. On the Right they had five full Squadrons of Hor&s;e; and among them one, call'd the <HI>Sterling</HI> Squadron,
<PB N="175" REF="176">
carrying the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s Standard: On the Left, they had the new Regiment, call'd the Re&s;torati|on Regiment of Hor&s;e, all compo&s;ed, as they gave out, of Gentlemen of Quality, and pretty well Hors'd, with &s;ix Squadrons of <HI>Huntley</HI>'s and <HI>Seaforth</HI>'s Cavalry.</P>
<P>Their &s;econd Line con&s;i&s;ted of 8 Battalions of Foot, but al&s;o not equal in Number, making about 2000 Men, flank'd with three Squadrons of Hor&s;e on each Wing; and behind the&s;e, at a Di&s;tance, they had about 400 Hor&s;e drawn up as a Re&s;erve, and who either were not ordered to come, or did not come into the Fight.</P>
<P>In this Order they advanc'd to the Moor, and in their March po&s;&s;e&s;s'd a Ri&s;ing Ground on their Right, which &s;o cover'd the Point of that Wing, that it could not be &s;een, as before, how far it extended.</P>
<P>Upon the Dukes fir&s;t extending his Right Wing, the Rebels, who were marching down directly upon him from the Moor afore&s;aid, and expected to have flank'd his Wing, and have charg'd before his Men were form'd, were di&s;ap|pointed in that Part; and the Duke, on the other hand, gave Order to his Cavalry immediately to charge the Enemy, the Infantry in the Center, at the &s;ame time advancing in good Order, as fa&s;t as they could.</P>
<P>The Enemy's Hor&s;e &s;tood the fir&s;t Charge very well, and fired very furiou&s;ly upon the Dragoons; but the&s;e, being better Hors'd, pre&s;s'd them very hard, and, at la&s;t, in Spite of the Vigour of the Men, who &s;hew'd that they wanted no Courage, bore them down by the meer Weight of their Hor&s;es; and putting them fir&s;t into Di&s;order, in little more than half an Hour they fled full Speed;
<PB N="176" REF="177">
but as the Dragoons in pur&s;uing kept their Order, the other rallied again in &s;everal Places, at great Di&s;tance one from another, and endeavouring to form again, &s;hew'd they had Di&s;po&s;ition enough to renew the Charge, if their Hor&s;es had been equal to tho&s;e of the Royal Troops.</P>
<P>This very Thing takes off a little the Objection which &s;ome have rai&s;ed again&s;t the Conduct of the Duke, as if he was too eager in the Pur&s;uit, while, in the mean time, his Left &s;uffer'd; for had he &s;lack'd the Pur&s;uit, and had not attack'd them in every Part as fa&s;t as they fac'd about, not giving them Time to rally any con&s;iderable Body together, he had had all his Work to do over again; e&s;pecially, con&s;idering a Body of 400 Hor&s;e appear'd drawn up at a Di&s;tance, ready to have &s;upported them, though, at that Time, there was a &s;mall River between.</P>
<P>This Manner of pur&s;uing likewi&s;e had its Diffi|culties, and the Enemy rallying thus continually, and every Minute making a bold Stand in one Place or other, may be gue&s;s'd at by the Length of Time which it took up to pu&s;h them out of the Field, for that it was from One a Clock to near Four before they gave it over, and pa&s;s'd the little River <HI>Allan,</HI> which yet was not above two Miles and half in all.</P>
<P>While this was doing on the Right, the Left Wing had a far different Fate; for, advancing to alter the Scituation of their Front, according to the Right, they found the Main Body of the Ene|my's Foot ju&s;t in their Front, and extending be|yond the Point of their Wing, the Enemy's Hor&s;e being &s;till to the Left, and in Condition to take them in Flank, their Hor&s;e al&s;o not being come up. The <HI>Highland</HI> Men taking the Signal from
<PB N="177" REF="178">
the Fire of their Left, fell on upon the three Re|giments of Foot, which were on the Left of the Royal Army, General <HI>Wightman,</HI> with the other three, being advanc'd to &s;upport the Right Wing: The Charge which the <HI>Highlanders</HI> gave, was &s;o furious, and their Officers led them on &s;o daringly, that they came up to the very Muz|zles of the Mu&s;quets; and notwith&s;tanding the Thru&s;t of the Bayonet, which the Mu&s;queteers gave in upon them very bravely, yet they ru&s;h'd in among the Ranks, receiving all their Fire, putting their Bayonets by with their Targets, and cut down the Men with their Broad Swords in a Moment, putting them into the utmo&s;t Confu|&s;ion.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the Horror which &s;ome of the Gentlemen of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Regiments &s;ay their Men were po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with at that unu&s;ual and &s;avage Way of Fighting: In a word, the three Battalions were broke, and a great many of them cut in Pieces in a few Moments; and tho&s;e which were not kill'd or taken, were driven in among the Dragoons, and put them likewi&s;e into Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Had the Cavalry upon the Right Wing of the Enemy fallen in at that Time, the whole Left Wing of the Royal Army had been cut off; nor was it in the Power of the re&s;t of the Foot to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, they being advanc'd after the Right Wing, to &s;upport them in the Pur&s;uit of the Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>The Hor&s;e of the Left Wing &s;eeing their Foot go thus to Wreck, after making a home Charge upon &s;ome Squadrons which &s;tood on their Flank, and who they oblig'd to retire, finding the Re|bels endeavouring to get behind them, and &s;o,
<PB N="178" REF="179">
either to march to <HI>Sterling,</HI> or cut off their Re|treat, found them&s;elves in no Condition to keep the Field, and retreated in good Order towards <HI>Sterling.</HI></P>
<P>By this time the Enemy, who perhaps thought their Victory compleat on their Side, as, no doubt, the Duke did on his, had, as it was reported, an Account of the Misfortune of their Left; and having no Enemy in their Front, they form'd the Infantry of their fir&s;t Line with &s;ome Hor&s;e, making near 5000 Men, and march'd directly back, following by a ha&s;ty March in the Rear of tho&s;e Battalions which General <HI>Wightman</HI> com|manded, and who were &s;till advancing after the Duke of <HI>Argyle.</HI></P>
<P>Had the Officer who led this Body, who, it is &s;aid by &s;ome, was Lieutenant General <HI>George Ha|milton;</HI> others, Lieutenant General <HI>Gordon;</HI> o|thers, that it was both; and that one was for charging immediately, the other for &s;taying till their Rear was come up: We &s;ay, had they charg'd the&s;e Regiments immediately, the King's Army had been undone; but, by halting upon the Hill to form their Troops, they gave General <HI>Wight|man</HI> Leave to face his Men to the Right about, as he him&s;elf &s;ays in his Account, and to get be|hind &s;ome little Banks, or old Enclo&s;ures, which &s;erv'd them for a Brea&s;t Work, and from that Cover, to draw off by little and little to <HI>Dum|blain,</HI> whither the Duke of <HI>Argyle,</HI> when he had entirely defeated the Left Wing of their Army, follow'd.</P>
<P>The Enemy having lo&s;t the Advantage, and thereby the Victory, march'd off after their Hor&s;e, who were gathering together on the other Side
<PB N="179" REF="180">
the little River; and &s;o they all went away to <HI>Ardoch,</HI> both Sides pretending to Victory; but, doubtle&s;s, the Royal Army had the Tokens of Honour, by taking four Pieces of Cannon, tho' indeed they were not carried off till next Day; and any one that came for them with Hor&s;es to draw them, might have had them; nay, the Rebels &s;ay, the Country People drew them off to <HI>Dumblain;</HI> the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> having lo&s;t the Artil|lery Hor&s;es, who all run away at the fir&s;t of the Battle, frighted with the Noi&s;e, as is not unu&s;ual. Thus ended this Day's Action; which, if it was not a Victory to the Duke, was certainly a Victo|ry to the King; for by this Battle the Heart of the Rebellion was broke; the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> was baulk'd in his De&s;ign; his Undertaking for a March to the South was laid a&s;ide, and never afterwards attempted, and the Superiority of his Maje&s;ty's Troops was acknowledg'd: Nor did the Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> or any of his Friends, ever di&s;|pute this Part of the Victory; for if they had not been broken in their Courage by the Terror of this Battle, why did they not continue the At|tempt, and proceed on their March after the Fight, their Numbers being not &s;o much dimi|ni&s;hed in Proportion as the Royal Army; for their Lo&s;s is not computed to be above 800 or 900 kill'd and taken, and the Royal Army is &s;aid to lo&s;e near 500 kill'd and taken; which is much more to 3500 Men, than the other was to 9000, or 10500, as was their Number before the Battle.</P>
<P>The Number of the Slain was reported as ei|ther Side thought fit; but as for Pri&s;oners on ei|ther Side, tho&s;e taken by the Royal Army a|mounted to about Eighty four, mo&s;t of whom
<PB N="180" REF="181">
were Gentlemen, the Defeat happening wholly among the Hor&s;e; the Number of Pri&s;oners taken by the Rebels, was &s;aid to be 200; but, as the other reported, was 110, be&s;ides Officers. The Earl of <HI>Strathmore,</HI> and the Captain of <HI>Clanra|nald,</HI> were kill'd on the Spot, on the Rebel Side; and the Earl of <HI>Forfar,</HI> in the King's Army; the Earl of <HI>I&s;lay,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI>'s Brother, was wounded in two Places, but not mortally. The Earl of <HI>Penmure,</HI> among the Rebels was wounded very much, and taken, but retaken by his Bro|ther, and carry'd off; and the Lord <HI>Strathalan</HI> was taken Pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>I return now to the Civil Admini&s;tration, which for a good while has been laid by: The Parlia|ment of <HI>Great Britain</HI> was now under a Rece&s;s, which both the publick and private Affairs call'd for; which Rece&s;s being but by Adjournment, all the Impeachments given in to the Hou&s;e of Peers &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, the Parliament Pri&s;oners remained, the Committee of Secrecy had Power to &s;it, and all the Publick Affairs were kept on in a State of formal Pro&s;ecution, as if the Hou&s;e had been &s;till &s;itting.</P>
<P>But the King had another Kingdom to ca&s;t his Eye upon, and which was equally expos'd, if not more, than this; and which, as he could not withdraw his Care of, and Protection from, with|out Diminution of the Glory of his Reign; &s;o nei|ther can my Account be compleat, unle&s;s I give &s;ome Account of what Steps were taken at this Time in that Part of the King's Dominions, and carry them on Hand in Hand with tho&s;e of this Nation.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="182">
<HI>Ireland</HI> had been for &s;ome time under the Influ|ence of the late Admini&s;tration, without the Pre|&s;ence of a &s;upreme Magi&s;trate. The Earl of <HI>Sun|derland,</HI> who had been nam'd Lord Lieutenant for that Kingdom, having been long indi&s;pos'd, was per&s;waded by his Friends to re&s;ign the Po&s;t of Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the Government was committed jointly to the Duke of <HI>Grafton,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Galway;</HI> and, without entring in|to the Times and Particulars of their being nomi|nated, their Preparations, travelling to <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> &s;hipping off, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it is &s;ufficient to &s;ay, they ar|riv'd at <HI>Dublin</HI> the 1&s;t of <HI>November,</HI> were receiv'd with the u&s;ual Solemnities, and immediately ap|ply'd them&s;elves to the proper Duties of that great Office, and to &s;et to Rights the Affairs of that Country, which they found in Confu&s;ion enough.</P>
<P>A Parliament had been call'd by the King's Proclamation &s;ome Time before; and the Lords Ju&s;tices being arriv'd in Time, the Two Hou&s;es met the 12th of <HI>November;</HI> and the fir&s;t Thing to be done, being the Choice of a Speaker, that Choice fell unanimou&s;ly upon <HI>William Connolly,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and as the Man was known, &s;o the Choice of him gave every one a Knowledge of the Temper of the Hou&s;e <HI>then,</HI> viz. how they &s;tood affected as to Parties.</P>
<P>The Speaker being cho&s;en and approv'd, the &s;ame Day the Lords Ju&s;tices made a Speech to both Hou&s;es, as follows:</P>
<P><HI>My Lords and Gentlemen,</HI></P>

<P><Q>&startq;We heartily congratulate with you upon the King's mo&s;t happy Acce&s;&s;ion to the Throne; being fully per&s;waded, that you have a due Sen&s;e of God's Mercy in this Act of his Divine Providence, which affords us &s;o fair a Pro&s;pect of becoming a flouri&s;hing People under the Reign of a Prince, who&s;e Wi&s;dom, Ju&s;tice and Clemency, entitle him to the Love and Obedi|ence of his Subjects at Home, as his Re&s;olution and &s;trict Ob&s;ervance of Treaties, have gain'd him the Re&s;pect and E&s;teem of his Allies a|broad.&endq;</Q></P>

<P><Q>&startq;We have his Maje&s;ty's Orders to acquaint you, that he will readily con&s;ort to &s;uch good Laws, as may conduce to make you an ea&s;y and a happy People; and you may be a&s;&s;ur'd, that we &s;hall always concur with you in every thing that may be advantageous to the King|dom; for which end we will willingly receive&endq; your Advice.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;We mu&s;t recommend to you in the pre&s;ent Conjuncture, all rea&s;onable Di&s;patch in your Proceedings; and &s;uch Unanimity in your Re|&s;olutions, as may once more put an end to all other Di&s;tinctions in <HI>Ireland,</HI> but that of Pro|te&s;tant&endq; and Papi&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>It will not con&s;i&s;t with the needful Brevity of the&s;e Annals, to repeat at large the Addre&s;&s;es of this Parliament, as well Lords as Commons; as well to the King, as to the Lords Ju&s;tices; I therefore purpo&s;ely omit them, being only Things in Cour&s;e, and Matter of u&s;ual Form, expre&s;&s;ing their Zeal for his Maje&s;ty's Service, Readine&s;s to do all that was requir'd of them, Thanks for the Speech from the Throne, and the like.</P>
<P>This Parliament being of a much different Sort from their immediate Predece&s;&s;ors in the Hou&s;e, apply'd very early to unravel what had been done in the la&s;t Sittings, and to &s;hew their Re&s;entment at &s;ome Per&s;ons and Proceedings during the late Admini&s;tration</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="186">
Fir&s;t having re&s;olv'd upon the Addre&s;&s;es of Thanks, <HI>as above,</HI> they began in the Hou&s;e of Peers with a Bill for recognizing his Maje&s;ty's Title to the Crown; and the Commons having fir&s;t &s;ettled their Committees, began with falling upon the King's Enemies; which produced the &s;everal Bills for farther Security of the Per&s;on and Government of the King, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Bill to attaint the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and give a Reward of <HI>50000l.</HI> for his Head; and for attainting the Duke of <HI>Or|mond,</HI> giving the Crown his E&s;tate, and <HI>10000l.</HI> Reward upon his Head.</P>
<P>The&s;e were follow'd of Cour&s;e by a Retro|&s;pect upon the Councils of the la&s;t Reign; and a Re&s;olve was pa&s;s'd, <HI>Nemine Contradicente,</HI> a|gain&s;t tho&s;e who advis'd the Queen to prorogue the late Parliament, at a Time when a Bill to attaint the <HI>Pretender</HI> was depending; and they were unanimou&s;ly voted to be Enemies to the Succe&s;&s;ion, and Favourers of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and <HI>Popery.</HI></P>
<P>They proceeded in the next Place to bring in a Bill to prevent Tumults, rebellious and rio|tous A&s;&s;emblies; All which Bills, together with the Supplies demanded, went thro the Hou&s;es in the u&s;ual Form, without the lea&s;t Oppo&s;ition; and being ratified in <HI>England,</HI> as the Con&s;titution requires, were fini&s;h'd, and receiv'd the Royal A&s;&s;ent; as &s;hall be ob&s;erv'd in its Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>But they did not end here; for on the <HI>17th</HI> the Commons, while the publick Accounts, which were order'd to be laid before them, were pre|paring, enter'd into another Enquiry, which brought a great many of their Members to their <HI>Peccavi</HI> on their Knees. The Ca&s;e was this: The
<PB N="186" REF="187">
la&s;t Hou&s;e of Commons in the Queen's Time, running pretty much the &s;ame way, had addre&s;s'd the Queen again&s;t Sir <HI>Con&s;tantine Phipps,</HI> at that Time Lord Chancellor of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and one of the Lords Ju&s;tices of that Kingdom, de&s;iring her Maje&s;ty to remove him from his Employ|ment; but as this Addre&s;s &s;eem'd at that Time not to be very acceptable to her Maje&s;ty, or to the Councils of that Reign, there were &s;undry other and counter Addre&s;&s;es procur'd and &s;ent up from the &s;everal Counties and Towns in <HI>Ire|land,</HI> in Favour of Sir <HI>Con&s;tantine Phipps;</HI> and de&s;iring that he might not be remov'd, not|with&s;tanding the &s;aid Addre&s;s of the Hou&s;e of Commons. This the Hou&s;e e&s;teem'd to be a Breach of the Privilege of Parliament; and re|&s;olv'd to &s;hew their Re&s;entment at the Per&s;ons who &s;ign'd tho&s;e Addre&s;&s;es, e&s;pecially &s;uch as were then Members of the &s;itting Parliament.</P>
<P>Accordingly they appointed a Committee to enquire what Addre&s;&s;es of that kind were &s;ent up to her late Maje&s;ty, and who &s;ign'd them; and they cen&s;ur'd, or brought to Acknowledgment, a great many Gentlemen upon this Account; and then they addre&s;s'd the Lords Ju&s;tices, to i&s;&s;ue out a Proclamation again&s;t the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> In|habitants of <HI>Limerick</HI> and <HI>Galway;</HI> It &s;eems, tho&s;e People in tho&s;e Towns, pre&s;uming upon the Con&s;truction they thought fit to put upon the Articles of Capitulation made with King <HI>William,</HI> for the Surrender of tho&s;e Places, had claim'd or pretended to an Exemption from the Penalties and Proce&s;s upon the other Laws again&s;t <HI>Papi&s;ts;</HI> upon Complaint whereof to the Hou&s;e, this Addre&s;s was founded.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="188">
In this Current of publick Re&s;entment, doing them&s;elves Ju&s;tice upon Excur&s;ions of the former ruling Party, they forgot not, even a mean News-Writer, one <HI>Richard Pue,</HI> who&s;e Ca&s;e was as follows.</P>
<P>There was in the latter End of the late Reign a De&s;ign much talk'd of, about breaking the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Army removing the <HI>Whiggi&s;h</HI> Officers and Regiments, and the like; which, however pre|vented, is not our Bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire; but it &s;eems it was only talk'd of, not done. But this News-Writer, in a publick Paper of his, call'd <HI>Pue</HI>'s <HI>Occurrences,</HI> almo&s;t two Years before this Enquiry, <HI>viz. March</HI> 30, 1714. had printed the following Paragraph as a piece of News.</P>
<P><HI>An Expre&s;s is &s;ent to</HI> Ireland <HI>for the immediate breaking the following Regiments there,</HI> viz. <HI>the Lord</HI> Mountjoy<HI>'s, Col.</HI> Charles Churchill<HI>'s, Col.</HI> Wade<HI>'s, and Col.</HI> Corbet<HI>'s, being all Foot; Col.</HI> Pepper<HI>'s, and Col.</HI> Kerr<HI>'s Dragoons. The hone&s;t People of</HI> Ireland <HI>will &s;uffer by the ill Practices and De&s;igns of their late factious Hou&s;e of Commons, which is a Pity; for the&s;e Draw-backs will be</HI> 40 <HI>or</HI> 50000 l. per Ann. <HI>out of that Kingdom's Way, be&s;ides the Lo&s;s of the Money the &s;aid &s;ix Regiments would &s;pend in their Country; and another of their Regiments is to be &s;ent to</HI> Port Mahone. <HI>Now, let their Whiggi&s;h Cloathiers and Cloth-Workers (in&s;tead of Wine every Night, as they had at the late Election for Parliament Men for your City and Country, at the</HI> Scots <HI>Amba&s;&s;adors on the</HI> Comb,) <HI>drink Tapla&s;h, which they may have cheap, &s;ince the additional Duty is off.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="189">
<Q>This Paper was cen&s;ur'd in the Hou&s;e to be &startq;a fal&s;e, &s;candalous, and malicious Libel, high|ly reflecting on the Ju&s;tice and Honour of the late Hou&s;e of Commons of <HI>Ireland;</HI> and or|der'd the &s;aid <HI>Pue</HI> to be taken into Cu&s;tody of their Serjeant at Arms, for printing the&endq; &s;ame.</Q></P>
<P>All this was but the fir&s;t Week's Work of the Hou&s;e, &s;o vigorou&s;ly did they go on in their Work. The next Week began with laying be|fore the Hou&s;e Ab&s;tracts of the publick Ac|counts, and &s;uch Things as the Hou&s;e had called for, for their Guidance in the Supply; and the Exci&s;e-Bill being pa&s;s'd, the Lords Ju&s;tices came to the Hou&s;e, and gave the Royal A&s;&s;ent to two Bills, Part of tho&s;e mentioned before, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. An Act for an additional Duty upon Beer, Ale, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 2. An Act to recognize his Ma|je&s;ty's Titles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The other Bills were not yet ready.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things and &s;uch like took up &s;o much of their time, that for &s;ome Weeks they did little el&s;e except the di&s;patch of the Money-Bills, which indeed went on all the while.</P>
<P>Upon the like re-examination of the Ca&s;e of Sr. <HI>Dudley Moor,</HI> in the late Reign, they cen&s;ur'd all the Judges that had any hand in it; the Ca&s;e was an alledg'd Partiality of the Judges, in Or|dering the Clerk of the Crown to &s;trike a Jury for that purpo&s;e; upon which, fir&s;t they re&s;olv'd upon the whole Debate, That by the Laws of the Land, and con&s;tant uninterrupted U&s;age of the Court of <HI>King's-Bench,</HI> all Juries in criminal Ca&s;es ought to be nominated and returned by the Sheriffs only, unle&s;s there be a legal Chal|lenge
<PB N="189" REF="190">
to his or their making &s;uch Return. This Re&s;olution &s;tated the Thing as it ought to have been; and then coming to examine how diffe|rent the Conduct of the People concern'd had been from what, by the U&s;age of Court, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it ought to have been, they fell upon the Per&s;ons them&s;elves in the following Re&s;olu|tions:</P>

<P><PB N="190" REF="191">
This Ca&s;e is too con&s;iderable to be omitted, as it &s;tands as a Precedent upon Record to warn the highe&s;t Officers of Ju&s;tice to act legally and up|rightly in their Offices.</P>
<P>On the 16th of <HI>January</HI> they adjourn'd, mo&s;t of the Bills they had depending being pa&s;s'd and &s;ent to <HI>England,</HI> for the Council here to approve, as is requir'd by the Con&s;titution of that Con|quer'd Kingdom.</P>
<P>I go back now to the Affairs of <HI>England;</HI> the <HI>Lanca&s;hire</HI> or <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI> Pri&s;oners, being, as is ob|&s;erv'd before, &s;ecur'd, the Noblemen and mo&s;t of the Gentlemen were Order'd to be brought to <HI>London,</HI> and they &s;et forward accordingly, on the 23d of <HI>November;</HI> they arriv'd at <HI>London</HI> the 9th of <HI>December.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, they were led through the Town as Pri&s;oners, and pinion'd; that is, their Arms bound, as is u&s;ual in &s;uch Ca&s;es: Nor could they be brought in any other Po&s;ture with equal Secu|rity; but this was but from <HI>Highgate</HI> to <HI>London;</HI> all the re&s;t of the Journey they had as much Ci|vility and good U&s;age &s;hewn them as they could expect, which many of them have acknow|ledged.</P>
<P>It is true, the common People in the Streets, as they pa&s;&s;ed, u&s;ed them very &s;curvily, and with Cur&s;es, Reproaches, and a thou&s;and Indignities, in&s;ulted them at an un&s;ufferable Rate; but as the Guard with them, in the fir&s;t place, did not en|courage the People to do it, and were no way in a Condition to prevent it, the Blame of it lies wholly upon the Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they were lodg'd, they were all un|bound; the Noblemen were treated with Ho|nour
<PB N="191" REF="192">
and Re&s;pect, at lea&s;t with Decency, and were lodg'd in the Tower; neither had any of the other Pri&s;oners any Irons put upon them, till their future Conduct made it ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary. Several of them were &s;ent for up, after their Commitment, to be examin'd before the Council, and el&s;ewhere; but their An&s;wers &s;eem'd to give no Token of any extraordinary Convi|ctions on their Minds, but they pleaded they had been led by Principle, or hurry'd into a ra&s;h Un|dertaking; that they were in the Hands of Pow|er, and mu&s;t undergo what they were plea&s;ed to inflict.</P>
<P>It is true, there was not Room for much to be &s;aid, the Fact, for which they were in Cu|&s;tody, being clear: There needed neither Evi|dence or Confe&s;&s;ion as to that Part; to Men taken in Arms, what Accu&s;ation could be want|ing? And as to tho&s;e few Things the Govern|ment de&s;ir'd to be inform'd of, they did not &s;eem forward to an&s;wer; &s;o they were remanded, as Per&s;ons the Government had no more to &s;ay to, but that they were to be dealt with in a judicial Way, which in the Sitting of the approaching Parliament we &s;hall have farther Occa&s;ion to &s;peak of.</P>
<P>From this Tragick Scene, we now ca&s;t our Eyes to that part of the Rebellion which &s;till &s;tood upon its Legs in <HI>Scotland.</HI> The Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> as was ob&s;erv'd before, remain'd at <HI>Perth,</HI> and his Troops canton'd in the Neighbouring Country, as the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> with his little Army, did at <HI>Sterling;</HI> but with this Difference, that the Duke's Army encrea&s;ed every Day, and the Dutch Troops, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who went by Sea, began to arrive; whereas the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI>'s
<PB N="192" REF="193">
Men were exceedingly dimini&s;h'd by the going off of the Earl of <HI>Seaforth,</HI> the Marquis of <HI>Huntley,</HI> and others; tho' it is true, that they made Pro|mi&s;es of returning again with larger Numbers; which Promi&s;es, however were never perform'd.</P>
<P>Yet was not the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> altogether with|out Supports in this Time; for as he was &s;ecure from any Attacks from the King's Troops on one hand, the violent Winter forbidding all Action, except by &s;mall Parties, for which here was very little Opportunity given; &s;o he was at liberty to &s;end Abroad his Agents, and Officers, by Per&s;ua&s;ions, Orders, Menaces and Entreatics, to ama&s;s great Sums of Money, as well by Loan as by Ce&s;s and Contribution, and likewi&s;e great Quantities of Provi&s;ion; nor was he idle in ma|king u&s;e of the Opportunities he had.</P>
<P>But this was not all; on the 22d of <HI>December,</HI> the <HI>Pretender</HI> him&s;elf Landed: He had three Ships in Company, with about 36 Gentlemen, &s;ome Arms and Ammunition; but only that one, in which the <HI>Pretender</HI> came, was hear'd of for &s;ome Days; which being a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el, but an excel|lent Sailor, made the Voyage in &s;even Days from <HI>Dunkirk</HI> to <HI>Peterhead,</HI> near <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> where he came on Shore, with only &s;ix Gentlemen in his Retinue.</P>
<P>Now the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> was arriv'd to the Top of his Expectations, and now he per&s;uaded all his Party, that the Time of their Deliverance was come, and that they &s;hould be able to Tri|umph over all their Enemies; and indeed, had the <HI>Pretender,</HI> as was expected, and as the mo&s;t Part of his Friends at <HI>Perth</HI> had been made to believe; I &s;ay had he brought but 10000 Men of good Di&s;ciplin'd Troops with him, the Face
<PB N="193" REF="194">
of their Affairs would have been very much chang'd: But, in&s;tead of this, it is apparent, he was as much &s;urpriz'd that he did not find a very great Army ready to march, as the Army was to find that he had not brought 10000 Men with him; which, it &s;eems, was the Number promi&s;ed.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pretender</HI> was no &s;ooner arriv'd, and Advice of it &s;ent to the Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> then at <HI>Perth,</HI> but he re&s;olved to go and attend him, which he did, with the Earl of <HI>Mari&s;chal,</HI> Lieu|tenant General <HI>Hamilton,</HI> and 20 or 30 Per&s;ons of Quality on Hor&s;eback, with a Guard of Hor&s;e to attend them. The <HI>Pretender</HI> Landing with this &s;mall Retinue, as above, pa&s;s'd <HI>Incog|nito,</HI> in Seamens Habits, to <HI>Newburgh,</HI> a Hou&s;e of the Lord <HI>Mari&s;chal,</HI> and thro' <HI>Aberdeen</HI> to <HI>Fetere&s;&s;o,</HI> where he continued till the 27th, and where he was met by the Earls of <HI>Mar, Mari&s;|chal,</HI> and the Company above-mention'd, where he Dre&s;s'd and di&s;cover'd him&s;elf, and began to keep a Court, the Noblemen and Gentlemen be|ing admitted to ki&s;s his Hand. In his Retinue was the young Lord <HI>Tinmouth,</HI> Son to the Duke of <HI>Berwick,</HI> two <HI>French</HI> Officers, and three <HI>Scots.</HI></P>
<P>He had &s;ome light Indi&s;po&s;ition while he &s;tay'd there, which proved an Ague, of which he had two Fits; and this detain'd him &s;ome Days; but on the <HI>2d</HI> of <HI>January,</HI> he removed to <HI>Briechin;</HI> thence, on the <HI>3d,</HI> to <HI>Keinard;</HI> the <HI>4th</HI> to <HI>Glames;</HI> and thence, on the <HI>5th,</HI> to <HI>Dun|dee,</HI> where he entred the Town on Hor&s;eback, the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> being on his Right Hand, and the Earl <HI>Mari&s;chal</HI> on his Left, with about 300 Gentlemen more attending him, be&s;ides &s;ome

Troops, which were for that Day only call'd his Guards.</P>
<P>Here his Friends de&s;iring it, he continued in the open Market-Place on Hor&s;eback, to &s;hew him&s;elf to the People, who crowded about him, and &s;houted and ki&s;s'd his Hand, as is u&s;ual on &s;uch Occa&s;ions: After which, he went to .... <HI>Stuart,</HI> Laird of <HI>Garntully</HI>'s Hou&s;e, where he Dined, and al&s;o lay there that Night. The next Day, <HI>Saturday</HI> the <HI>7th,</HI> he went to <HI>Ca&s;tle-lyon,</HI> a Seat of the Earl of <HI>Strathm$re,</HI> where he Din'd, and Lodg'd that Night at Sir <HI>David Triplin</HI>'s: The <HI>8th</HI> being <HI>Sunday,</HI> he went to <HI>Schoon;</HI> and the <HI>9th,</HI> he made his Publick Entry into <HI>Perth:</HI> He made no Stay at <HI>Perth,</HI> but return'd that Night to <HI>Schoon,</HI> except that he had the Curio&s;ity to view &s;ome of the Soldiers Quar|ter'd in the Town, and who were drawn out for him to &s;ee: they made a tolerable Ap|pearance, tho' it was thought the Habit of the <HI>Highlanamen</HI> might at fir&s;t &s;eem very &s;trange to him.</P>
<P>Before we di&s;mi&s;s this Scene, we mu&s;t give, at large, tho&s;e publick Tran&s;actions on his Side, on which the Story it &s;elf depends, and without which the Hi&s;tory would not be compleat; And fir&s;t, it is to be ob&s;erv'd, that as &s;oon as the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> was come to <HI>Fetere&s;&s;o,</HI> and they had open'd the fir&s;t Face of a Court; the fir&s;t Thing done after the Per&s;on was own'd, and known, was, to cau&s;e him to be proclaim'd King at the Gates of the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Immediately from hence they publi&s;h his De|claration, dated at <HI>Commercy</HI> in <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and di&s;|per&s;e printed Copies of it to be &s;ent all over <HI>Britain.</HI></P>

Having begun thus to take upon him the Style and Maje&s;ty of a King, it follow'd, that he &s;hould receive the u&s;ual Homage of Subjects, and exerci&s;e the Regal Power: The fir&s;t he receiv'd by the Addre&s;&s;es of the People, and the &s;econd by conferring Titles of Honour.</P>
<P>As to Addre&s;&s;es, the fir&s;t was from the Epi&s;|copal Clergy of <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> and the &s;econd from the Magi&s;trates, the Town Council, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the City of <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> there having been no other Addre&s;&s;es pre&s;ented to him in Form.</P>
<P>As to his Acts of Royal Authority which he took upon him, it was to confer Knighthoods, Nobility, and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Dignities, on &s;uch as appear'd zealous for him: But as they all died, and are forgotten, &s;o the Per&s;ons them|&s;elves, doubtle&s;s, decline the Honour de&s;ign'd them.</P>
<P>Being returned to <HI>Schoon,</HI> he &s;ettled, and ap|pointed a Privy-Council, and entred upon a formal Admini&s;tration of his Affairs, publi&s;hing &s;everal Proclamations and Orders; as a Pro|clamation for a Day of Thank&s;giving for his Arrival; an Order for Praying for him in the Churches, and di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the Mini&s;ters that refus'd it; a Proclamation for &s;ummoning a Con|vention of E&s;tates, an Order for the Currency of Foreign Coins; another for arming all the fencible Men, as u&s;ual, from 16 to 60; and la&s;tly, one for his Coronation to be on the 23d of <HI>January;</HI> But he found other Employments for his Thoughts before that Time; and almo&s;t all the&s;e Proclamations and Orders had little other Ceremony attending them than their fir&s;t Publication.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="197">
We meet with very little farther tran&s;acted, after this, till the Motions of the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> began to put them upon &s;erious Reflections on the State of their Affairs; and, upon con&s;idering clo&s;ely whether to &s;tand the Attack of the Royal Army, or provide in Time for their own Safety. Some have &s;aid the&s;e Things took up long De|bates; but I have been a&s;&s;ur'd, that from the fir&s;t of the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s Landing, when they found the <HI>French</HI> declin'd him, and would not venture an open Declaration in his Favour; and he &s;aw how divided, how naked of Defence, and how uncapable of engaging the Royal Army, they were at home, it was no more a difficulty with them, whether they &s;hould retreat or no; but it was re&s;olv'd on in the very fir&s;t Cabinet Con&s;ul|tations, and that all the Appearance of Prepara|tions for a vigorous Defence, the &s;ummoning all their Troops together, the &s;ending Expre&s;&s;es for the Lords, <HI>Seaforth</HI> and <HI>Huntley,</HI> the holding a great Council, and every other Thing that look'd like Re&s;i&s;tance, was to amu&s;e the World, and to cover their Re&s;olutions of retiring from the Knowledge of their own People, who, had the lea&s;t Jealou&s;y of what happen'd afterwards been in their Heads, had been more dangerous to them than the Royal Army.</P>
<P>From this Con&s;ideration, we cannot &s;o much wonder at the Cruelty of their firing the Villa|ges, and burning the Corn, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or &s;ay how ri|diculous it was, when they had no Intentions to fight; the Rea&s;on is plain, <HI>viz,</HI> they were un|der an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of making their own People believe that they re&s;olv'd to fight the Royal Army, and it was not Words that would
<PB N="197" REF="198">
do this; they were to make all the vi&s;ible Ap|pearances of it; they were to advance their Troops, fortify the Place, and make all the Di&s;|po&s;itions for Action that they would have done if they really were de&s;igning to fight; and there|fore, nothing could be in a greater Hurry and Bu&s;tle, than the People at <HI>Perth</HI> were in for a Week or ten Days before they were to go away; nor was there any thing to be &s;een but planting of Guns, marking out Brea&s;t-works and Tren|ches; and, in a word, all po&s;&s;ible Preparation for Action, in&s;omuch that all our News-Papers, for &s;ome Days, a&s;&s;ur'd us, that the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s People re&s;olv'd to fight, and were putting them|&s;elves in a Po&s;ture to give the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> a very warm Reception.</P>
<P>All this while the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> was at <HI>Sterling;</HI> and tho' he made no Motion, yet he was far from being idle; his Troops began to encrea&s;e: <HI>Newton</HI>'s and <HI>Stanhope</HI>'s Regiments of Dragoons had joyn'd him from <HI>England,</HI> and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Regiments were at hand; &s;ome of them having already pa&s;s'd the Border by Land, and about 2000 of them were arrived by Sea. Ge|neral <HI>Cadogan</HI> was come, and Major General <HI>Vanderbeck,</HI> who commanded the <HI>Dutch</HI> Troops, was al&s;o with him. They had view'd the Coun|try, and had con&s;ider'd the Scituation of the Enemy; and being re&s;olv'd to attack the Gen|tlemen at <HI>Perth,</HI> as &s;oon as the Troops were all joyn'd, let the Fro&s;t and the Snows offer what Difficulty they might, he made Preparations for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>In the Interval of the&s;e things, there hap|pen'd &s;ome &s;mall Rencouters between the For|ces
<PB N="198" REF="199">
on both Sides; which, however &s;mall, &s;erve to compleat our Hi&s;tory of this unhappy In&s;ur|rection. And fir&s;t, as to the Motions of the Earl of <HI>Sutherland,</HI> and the Gentlemen with him in the North, they had frequent Marches and Attempts to engage, between them and the Earl of <HI>Seaforth:</HI> tho' it never came to Blows; at la&s;t, by the Interpo&s;ition of the Lady Dowager of <HI>Seaforth,</HI> a Submi&s;&s;ion was &s;ign'd by the Earl; and a like Treaty was, with better Effect, con|cluded al&s;o with the Marquis of <HI>Huntley;</HI> for as to <HI>Seaforth,</HI> he fell off, and run to Arms again, to his own Ruine, as &s;hall be related afterward. Thus the Earl of <HI>Sutherland,</HI> and the Noblemen and Gentlemen on the King's Side in tho&s;e parts, not only kept their Ground, but gain'd very much, and pre&s;erv'd all that part of the Country in the King's Intere&s;t, till the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI>'s Army came up to them to fini&s;h the Work.</P>
<P>From thence we come down to the South, to the Shore of <HI>Fife;</HI> and there the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> order'd one of the Men of War, Lying in <HI>Leith</HI> Road, to &s;tand over towards the other Shore, and &s;ee if he could lie near enough to <HI>Brunt I&s;land,</HI> to throw a few Shot into the Town, and batter them a little; the Captain of the Man of War did &s;o, and Cannonaded the Town for an Hour or two; upon which the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI>'s Men quitted the Place, imagining, as was &s;aid after|wards, that as &s;oon as the Cannonading was over, the Captain of the Man of War would at|tempt to land; and there not being a &s;ufficient Number of Men in the Place to defend it, they re&s;olv'd to abandon it; they left behind them &s;ix Pieces of Cannon, being Ship Guns; &s;ome Arms, with a good Quantity of Provi&s;ions:
<PB N="199" REF="200">
Upon Advice of this to General <HI>Cadogan,</HI> who was then at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> he order'd a Detachment of <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Troops to pa&s;s the <HI>Firth,</HI> and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Place, under the Command of Sir <HI>John Montgomery:</HI> Upon his Arrival, the Rebels quitted likewi&s;e all the Towns on the North Side of the <HI>Firth.</HI> They had afterwards a little Skirmi&s;h with &s;ome of the Dutch Soldiers at <HI>Dy&s;ert,</HI> but of no Con&s;equence; Nine of the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI>'s Men coming to the Lord <HI>Sinclair</HI>'s Coal-Pits, to fetch Coals to carry to <HI>Perth,</HI> were &s;ur|rounded by the <HI>Dutch;</HI> and, taking Shelter in a Hou&s;e, refus'd to yield, till two of them being kill'd, the re&s;t &s;urrender'd.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, to begin the Year, about the fir&s;t or &s;econd of <HI>January,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Rothes,</HI> with a good Body of Volunteers, and about 30 or 40 <HI>Dutch</HI> Foot, march'd to attack <HI>Falkland,</HI> an old Royal Hou&s;e of the King's of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but decay'd; the Rebels having Notice of this De|&s;ign, &s;ent a Body of their Troops into the Place, and with another Party &s;urrounded the <HI>Dutch</HI> Sol|diers, and about 30 Gentlemen in a Village; the Gentlemen got mo&s;t of them off, but the Foot were made Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>Upon this Succe&s;s of the Rebels, and to re|&s;train their Excur&s;ions, the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> order'd three Battalions of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Foot to pa&s;s the <HI>Firth</HI> at <HI>Queen's Ferry,</HI> and take quarters at <HI>Inner|keithing, Dumfermling,</HI> and the Towns thereabouts, which perfectly cover'd that part of the Country, and kept the Enemy within Bounds.</P>
<P>The latter end of <HI>December</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> Troops arriv'd, mo&s;t of them took Po&s;t in the Army; there had been a Train of Artillery, and all
<PB N="200" REF="201">
Stores &s;uitable to the Service Ship'd at <HI>London,</HI> but had lain Wind-bound at the <HI>Buoy on the Nore</HI> &s;o long, that the Duke of <HI>Argyle,</HI> who&s;e Orders were to Fight without lo&s;s of time, thought fit not to run the ri&s;que of being di&s;appointed of Cannon, thought convenient to &s;end to <HI>Berwick</HI> upon <HI>Tweed</HI> for Ten pieces of Cannon, and four Mortars, which were accordingly &s;ent, 1500 Hor|&s;es being furni&s;h'd at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> for the bringing them away.</P>
<P>But before they arriv'd, or at lea&s;t before the Army march'd, the Train arriv'd from <HI>England</HI> al&s;o by Sea, and tho' there was no occa&s;ion for Guns, yet the Gunners, Engineers, Fire-Men, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were very much wanted.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as General <HI>Cadogan</HI> came back to <HI>Ster|ling,</HI> having been at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> &s;ome Days, a Great Council of War was held, where it was re&s;olv'd to march with the whole Army, and at|tack the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> and all his Forces in their Quarters at <HI>Perth,</HI> or in their Camp, wherever they &s;hould be found.</P>
<P>The Mea&s;ures concerted, the Order of Battle appointed, and Orders were immediately given out to prepare every thing needful again&s;t the Time; and becau&s;e it was found, that the Depth of the Snow, which was in mo&s;t places two or three Foot thick, would very much retard the March of the Infantry and Cannon, if not make it impracticable; Orders were given to Summon in &s;everal Thou&s;ands of the Countrymen to re|move the Snow, and to open a plain Road for the Pa&s;&s;age of the Carriages.</P>
<P>On the <HI>21&s;t,</HI> 200 Dragoons were detach'd to|wards <HI>Perth,</HI> to di&s;cover the Country, and &s;ee if they could, into the Po&s;ture of the Enemy; and
<PB N="201" REF="202">
to &s;ee in what Condition the Roads were for the Army's pa&s;&s;ing. Colonel <HI>Ghe&s;t,</HI> who commanded this Party, did as he was commanded, and brought back his Account to the General; but knew no|thing that his advancing had alarm'd the Enemy to that Degree, as to put all the City of <HI>Perth</HI> into a Hurry, &s;ome Country People coming in full &s;peed, and telling them, that the Duke of <HI>Argyle,</HI> with all his Cavalry, and 4000 Foot, mounted on Hor&s;es, was in full March to attack them; nor was this Fright over, till a Party of Hor&s;e being &s;ent to <HI>Tullibardin,</HI> and from thence every way to view the Roads, &s;ent expre&s;s word, that all was quiet, and that no Enemy appear'd.</P>
<P>On the <HI>24th,</HI> the Duke, with General <HI>Cado|gan,</HI> and a &s;trong Party of Hor&s;e, went out them|&s;elves to view the Country, and particularly the Roads, which the Workmen were all this while bu&s;y in clearing and making good: This March of the Duke caus'd a &s;econd Alarm, and made &s;ome of their Men, who were in the mo&s;t ad|vanced Po&s;ts, retire; but the Alarm did not reach to <HI>Perth,</HI> as the other had.</P>
<P>On the <HI>26th,</HI> the Duke order'd two Regiments of Dragoons, and 500 Foot, to advance to <HI>Dumblain,</HI> with Directions to po&s;t a &s;trong Party at the demoli&s;h'd Bridge of <HI>Down.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ame Day, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>29th,</HI> the Army began their March, and marched to <HI>Dumblam;</HI> the Troops that were at <HI>Dumblain</HI> before, advancing at the &s;ame time, came to the old Ca&s;tle of <HI>Bra$o,</HI> expecting &s;ome Re&s;i&s;tance, but they found it abandon'd; the next Morning the &s;ame Party, with two Pieces of Cannon, advanc'd upon the Road to <HI>Tullibardin,</HI> to cover the Workmen, who were at Work to clear the Way, and to prevent
<PB N="202" REF="203">
their being in&s;ulted by the Gari&s;on of <HI>Tullibardin.</HI> That Day the Army advanc'd to <HI>Auchteratder;</HI> and here indeed the Rebels having burnt all the Hou&s;es, as is &s;aid before, the poor Soldiers had cold Quarters, having no Lodging but in the Snow, nor any other Covering but the fine Ca|nopy of Heaven; or, as the <HI>French</HI> &s;ay, <HI>les belles E&s;toilles,</HI> the beautiful Stars. The one and Thir|tieth, they pa&s;s'd the River <HI>Ern,</HI> and came to <HI>Tullibardin,</HI> the Gari&s;on of which was with|drawn, except 50 Men, who were made Pri&s;o|ners; and here it was, the Duke receiv'd the welcome News, that the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and all his Army, had abandon'd <HI>Perth</HI> the Day before, and were retir'd towards <HI>Dundee.</HI></P>
<P>Though the Army were as keen for Action as could be de&s;ir'd; yet as the Soldiers had now lain two Nights in the Snow; for at <HI>Tullibardin</HI> they could not get Shelter for the common Sol|diers, they were not a little glad of warmer Quarters: The Duke had not the Account till near four a Clock in the Afternoon that the Ene|my was gone; and therefore it being near dark it was not po&s;&s;ible to get there that Day; how|ever, he detach'd immediately four Squadrons of Dragoons, and 2 Battalions of Foot, to take Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Town, and went him&s;elf with them and marching all Night, they enter'd <HI>Perth</HI> by the Light of the Snow about two a Clock in the Morning, at the Head of the Dragoons; the two Battallions having march'd all the Day before, were fatigu'd with the length of the way, and Want of Re&s;t, and could not reach the Place till Ten of the Clock the next Morning; in which had the Enemy had Intelligence, and been nimble enough to have taken the Advantage, the Duke
<PB N="203" REF="204">
had been in &s;ome Hazard; but they had other Bu&s;ine&s;s upon their Hands.</P>
<P>The next Morning, the whole Army decamp|ed from their cold Quarter, at <HI>Tullibardin,</HI> and, marching with what Speed they could make, ar|riv'd at <HI>Perth</HI> that Evening, being the <HI>1&s;t</HI> of <HI>Feb|ruary,</HI> where they had good Quarters.</P>
<P>I have given the&s;e Accounts from the mo&s;t certain Narrations of them which were made publick at that time, even by the Whiggs them|&s;elves, and even in their very Words, except where the matters them&s;elves may &s;ince have regu|lated tho&s;e Accounts; &s;o that they cannot al|ledge my Hi&s;tory to be deficient, much le&s;s par|tial in any thing.</P>
<P>The Fatigue which the Army had met with in this march however &s;hort, was &s;uch, that it was ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to give them &s;ome re&s;t; and yet the nece&s;&s;ity of the Service requir'd they &s;hould immediately proceed and follow the Enemy as clo&s;e at the Heels as po&s;&s;ible; e&s;pecially con|&s;idering they had already four Days &s;tart of the Royal Army; having quitted <HI>Perth</HI> the <HI>30th</HI> of <HI>January,</HI> and it being now the <HI>2d</HI> of <HI>February.</HI></P>
<P>The Duke therefore &s;et forward again with &s;ix Squadrons of Dragoons, three Battalions, and 800 Foot Detach'd out of all the Regiments, and came to <HI>Dundee</HI> the third, the re&s;t of the Army following by more ea&s;ie marches, came thither the next Day.</P>
<P>From hence &s;ending &s;till Detachments on be|fore them to pur&s;ue on the Road to <HI>Montro&s;e,</HI> &s;ome by the way of <HI>Brechim,</HI> others by that of <HI>Aberbrothick,</HI> the Duke with the whole Army marched the fifth; and as they were upon this march, they receiv'd an Account that the <HI>Pre|tender</HI>
<PB N="204" REF="205">
was gone, having taken Shipping at <HI>Mon|tro&s;e,</HI> together with the Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> and &s;ome others, and left the Army to make the be&s;t of their way to the Hills, in order to their E&s;cape from the Royal Army, the Hor&s;e being of little or no U&s;e there.</P>
<P>General <HI>Gordon,</HI> the Lord <HI>Tinmouth,</HI> the Earl <HI>Mari&s;chal,</HI> and &s;everal others, which our common Accounts mentioned to be left to &s;hift for them|&s;elves, kept with the Army, and continu'd their March to <HI>Aberdeen;</HI> the Foot marching on be|fore with General <HI>Gordon,</HI> and the Earl <HI>Ma|ri&s;chal,</HI> with about 1000 Hou&s;e, keeping the Rear, to prevent Surprize; nor, if we may be|lieve their own Relation, was the Earl <HI>Mari&s;chal,</HI> and General <HI>Gordon,</HI> in &s;uch extraordinary Tran&s;ports of Anger and De&s;pair, on the News of the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s E&s;cape; tho' perhaps, they might think fit to act &s;uch a Part, for the pre|&s;ent Occa&s;ion: But otherwi&s;e there is no Doubt but they were made acquainted with the De&s;ign; and, being well a&s;&s;ur'd that their own E&s;cape would be in Time provided for, they agreed to take the Hazard for the Service of their Cau&s;e, and continue with the Troops till they carry'd them clear of the pur&s;uing Army; and this they did &s;o effectually, as gave the Gentlemen Op|portunity to make their E&s;capes afterward at more Lei&s;ure, and gave the common People Op|portunity to di&s;per&s;e, and retire to their Dwel|lings; &s;o that in all the Pur&s;uit which the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> made, tho' he lo&s;t no Time, and har|ra&s;t the Troops very &s;orely; yet they were not able to overtake any Part of them, nor did they, except &s;uch as voluntarily &s;urrender'd, make 100 Pri&s;oners in the whole Pur&s;uit from <HI>Perth</HI> to
<PB N="205" REF="206">
<HI>Aberdeen,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Locqubaber,</HI> where they &s;eparated: But even after they had &s;o &s;epa|rated, they went every Man his own Way qui|etly enough, till particular Detachments were &s;ent under General <HI>Cadogan,</HI> near two Months after, upon Notice that they had appointed to rally their Forces again.</P>
<P>To confirm this Opinion, it appears, that General <HI>Gordon,</HI> who took upon him the Com|mand after the Flight of the re&s;t, march'd on to <HI>Aberdeen;</HI> and there, drawing up the Troops together, he pulls out a Paper of In&s;tructions from the <HI>Pretender,</HI> which, as he &s;aid, he had Order not to open till he came to that City. In this Paper, the <HI>Pretender</HI> complains of Di&s;|appointments from abroad principally, and of the Nece&s;&s;ity he was under, for his own Pre&s;er|vation, to leave the Country; that he thanked them for their cheerful Undertaking &s;o hazar|dous an Enterprize; which, had it been as well &s;econded by others, who had likewi&s;e engaged to do it, might have had better Succe&s;s: He recommends to them to con&s;ult their own Secu|rity, by keeping together till they can come to &s;uch Places, where they may &s;eparate without being made a Prey to their Enemies; and encou|rages them to expect to hear farther from him in a very &s;hort Time.</P>
<P>It was the <HI>4th</HI> of <HI>February</HI> that the <HI>Pretender</HI> embarkt, and the <HI>6th</HI> in the Morning they reach'd <HI>Aberdeen;</HI> where their Friends receiv'd them with dejected Countenances, and that with good Rea&s;on, con&s;idering that they were now like to be call'd to a &s;trict Account for their having formerly entertain'd them after another manner.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="207">
They had no Time to lo&s;e; for the Duke of <HI>Argyle,</HI> who made every Day fre&s;h Detachments after them, was at their Heels. On the <HI>7th</HI> in the Morning, they began to march out of <HI>Aber|deen,</HI> and by two in the Afternoon had entirely quitted it; and here having in the &s;hort Time of their Stay, procured three Ve&s;&s;els for car|rying off more Gentlemen, who re&s;olv'd to e&s;cape, tho&s;e Ve&s;&s;els receiv'd private Orders to meet them to the North of <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> under the Shores of <HI>Peterhead, Buchan-Ne&s;s,</HI> and other Parts, and about 200 Gentlemen, who were concern'd in that De&s;ign, parted from the Army, and march'd in a Body to the Places appointed, where, in &s;everal Creeks and Harbours, mo&s;t of them embarkt, and got off; but one Ship, fall|ing in with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Crui&s;ers, was oblig'd to &s;tand in again for the Shore, and land their Cargo; yet the Gentlemen, knowing the Coun|try perfectly well, found means to get Hor&s;es again, and make their Way to the Hills after the flying Army; nor did any of them, upon the&s;e Occa&s;ions, fall into the Hands of the pur&s;uing Army: It was reckon'd that about 140 Gentle|men made their E&s;cape at that Time, and landed all &s;afe in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>On the <HI>8th,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> arriv'd at <HI>A|berdeen</HI> with 400 Men; but the re&s;t of the Army not being come up, the Pur&s;uit could not be carry'd on, &s;ave that Major General <HI>Evans</HI> was detach'd with 200 Dragoons, and &s;ome Foot, to endeavour to cut off their Hor&s;e, who &s;till kept in the Rear of their Army, from the re&s;t; and particularly, to follow tho&s;e two Hundred, who went towards the Sea to embark.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="208">
General <HI>Evans</HI> did his be&s;t to intercept the&s;e Gentlemen, and follow'd them to <HI>Frazersburgh,</HI> from thence they were gone to <HI>Bampff,</HI> whither he could not follow, but &s;ent a Detachment of 40 Dragoons, with &s;ome Foot to follow them thither: It is true, the Letter which General <HI>E|vans</HI> &s;ent to the Duke, as it was made publick, does not mention that any were embarkt; but it &s;eems to imply, that it was known to be &s;o, &s;eeing the General would venture to pur&s;ue the re&s;t with but 40 Dragoons.</P>
<P>The main Body of the Rebels &s;till kept toge|ther, the Foot marching in the Van, and the Cavalry in the Rear, to prevent their being at|tack'd by the &s;mall Detachments of Dragoons which follow'd them; and in this Order they march'd thro' <HI>Strath-Spey,</HI> and the Country about the River <HI>Don,</HI> to the Mountains of <HI>Badenoch,</HI> where they re&s;ted, being in perfect Safety from the Dragoons, who knew better things than to venture after them thither, tho&s;e Places not be|ing practicable for the Hor&s;e; and therefore the Duke on the t'other hand, contenting him to &s;pread his Detachments over all the flat Coun|try, put an end here to the pur&s;uit, and &s;ent a Body of Men to open a Communication with the Earl of <HI>Sutherland</HI> and his Friends at <HI>Inverne&s;s,</HI> which was done.</P>
<P>And thus we are come to an end of the Re|bellion; that is to &s;ay, as far as relates to the Action in the Field. The Enemy having little left to do but to &s;eparate their Foot, and the Gentlemen to make their E&s;cape beyond Sea in the be&s;t manner they could, which however &s;o
<PB N="208" REF="209">
many did, that it was unaccountable to think how few fell into the Hands of the King's Offi|cers after the retreat from <HI>Perth,</HI> the great num|ber of Gentlemen in Arms being con&s;ider'd.</P>
<P>One of the Salleys they made for this pupo&s;e, was &s;o very bold, and yet &s;o well executed, that it de&s;erves to be recorded; it was at that time when their Army &s;eparated at <HI>Badenoch,</HI> when a certain Number of the Gentlemen, who had made &s;ecret Provi&s;ion for their E&s;cape, receiv'd Advice that two <HI>French</HI> Frigates, one of twenty &s;ix Guns, and one of eighteen, were arriv'd for their Relief, and that they would lie in the Road of the <HI>O$kneys,</HI> in <HI>Pentland Firth,</HI> till they heard from them. Upon this Advice, the Lord <HI>Duffus,</HI> Sir <HI>Geo. Sinclair,</HI> Lieutenant General <HI>Eclyn,</HI> and about 160 Gentlemen in all, on Hor&s;eback, and well mounted, made a Sally from the Hills, and, cro&s;&s;ing the Shire of <HI>Murray,</HI> came to the Sea|&s;ide near <HI>Burgh;</HI> where getting ten large Boats, they quitted &s;ome of their Hor&s;es to their Ser|vants, and killed the re&s;t, to prevent their falling into the Hands of the Dragoons, &s;o to be u&s;ed again&s;t their Friends. And thus being embark'd, they committed them&s;elves to the Sea, and &s;ailed away for the <HI>Orkneys:</HI> They put in at <HI>Dunbeth,</HI> and 60 of them got there two large Barks, with which they pur&s;ued their Voyage, and went all on Board the <HI>French</HI> Frigate of 26 Guns; the re&s;t landed in <HI>Arskerry,</HI> another of the I&s;lands; and having pre&s;s'd a <HI>Scots</HI> Ve&s;&s;el to carry them to the Place where the other Frigate lay, the Coun|try began to ri&s;e upon them, fearing to be plun|der'd: But at fir&s;t, the <HI>French</HI> Ship coming to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, they were too &s;trong for the
<PB N="209" REF="210">
Country People; &s;o &s;econdly, telling them they were all Gentlemen, who were flying for their Lives; that they would hurt no body, and pay for what they had; the Country People acquie&s;c'd, and let them alone.</P>
<P>The other Ships coming in, they all embark'd, and, as we heard afterwards, they landed at <HI>Gottenbro',</HI> in the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s Dominions.</P>
<P>There were yet with the Rebels, the Earls <HI>Mari&s;chal, Lithgow, Southesk</HI> and <HI>Seaforth,</HI> who about this Time came to them again; the Mar|quis of <HI>Tullibardin,</HI> Lord <HI>Tinmouth, Drummond, Pit&s;ligo, Rollo,</HI> &amp;c. Al&s;o Sir <HI>Donald Mackdonald,</HI> the Clans of <HI>Glengary, Glenderule, Auchenbroek, Lo|cheal, Clanranald, Glencoe, Keppoch, Appin, Cameron,</HI> and abundance of <HI>Lowland</HI> Gentlemen; but they were all taken to the Mountains, where they &s;helter'd them&s;elves from the Pur&s;uers for &s;ome Time.</P>
<P>As to the Duke of <HI>Argyle,</HI> having fini&s;h'd the Pur&s;uit as above, and Cantoned his Men, he left the Army, which indeed wanted refre&s;hment very &s;orely; and having made a reparation of Quarters, he left General <HI>Cadogan</HI> to Command them, and came back to <HI>Edinburgh</HI> the <HI>27th</HI> of <HI>February;</HI> and was at the great Meeting of the Peers for Election of a Lord of Parliament in the room of the Marquis of <HI>Tweedal</HI> decea&s;ed.</P>
<P>The new Choice fell upon the Earl of <HI>Had|dington.</HI> Here he receiv'd the Earl of <HI>Murray,</HI> who came now over to the Winning Side, and took the Oaths. And the Duke having been magnificently Entertain'd by the City of <HI>Edin|burgh,</HI> &s;et forward for Court, where he arriv'd the <HI>6th</HI> of <HI>March.</HI></P>

I come back now to the Civil Admini&s;tration; the Parliament of <HI>Ireland</HI> was in a rece&s;s for &s;ome time as above; they &s;at again the <HI>16th</HI> of <HI>Ja|nuary,</HI> where they receiv'd the Bills &s;ent to <HI>Eng|land,</HI> Voted an A&s;&s;ociation, and to &s;hew their Zeal on account of the Rebellion. They Voted, that whatever Forces his Maje&s;ty &s;hall think fit to rai&s;e, or whatever Expence his Ma|je&s;ty &s;hould think nece&s;&s;ary for the Defence of the Kingdom, they would make good the &s;ame, and order'd this to be put into an Ad|dre&s;s.</P>
<P>Al&s;o they re&s;olv'd to Addre&s;s the Lords Ju|&s;tices, to &s;ecure the Per&s;ons of all &s;uch as they &s;hould &s;u&s;pect to be di&s;affected to the Govern|ment; al&s;o they declare it to be the indi&s;pen&s;ible Duty of all the Magi&s;trates in that Kingdom, to put the Laws in immediate Execution again&s;t all Popi&s;h Prie&s;ts, who &s;hall Officiate contrary to Law; and that tho&s;e, who neglect the &s;ame, &s;hall be look'd upon as Enemies to the Con&s;ti|tution.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;on of all the&s;e extraordinary Steps at that Time, was an Alarm ju&s;t then given, both in <HI>England</HI> and in <HI>Ireland,</HI> of the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> being preparing a great Power in the We&s;tern Ports of <HI>France,</HI> and al&s;o in <HI>Spain,</HI> in order to invade the King's Dominions; and that it was expected he would make an Attempt to Land in <HI>Ireland,</HI> as well as <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>After this, they renewed the Enquiry into the misbehaviour of their Members in the late Reign, and after but a &s;hort Debate, they fell upon the Earl of <HI>Angle&s;ea,</HI> who it &s;eems they had a handle again&s;t upon the old Score, <HI>of advi&s;ing the late</HI>

<HI>Queen to Prorogue the Parliament;</HI> and having fir&s;t car|ried the previous Que&s;tion in their former Sit|ting on the <HI>15th</HI> of <HI>November,</HI> viz. That <HI>whoever advis'd the Queen to Prorogue the Parliament, &amp;c. was an Enemy to the Succe&s;&s;ion,</HI> they founded ano|ther Que&s;tion now, and carried it, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That whoever advis'd the irregular breaking great part of the Army in this Kingdom, immediately after the &s;aid un&s;ea&s;onable Proroguing the late Parli|ament, as afore&s;aid, were Enemies to the Prote|&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, and de&s;ign'd to bring in the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and Popery.</P>
<P>The Way being thus clear'd to the Mark they aim'd at, the Que&s;tion was put, <HI>That it is the Opinion of this Hou&s;e, that</HI> Arthur <HI>Earl of</HI> Angle&s;ey, <HI>was one of the principal Advi&s;ers of her late Maje&s;ty to prorogue the &s;aid Parliament, and break the &s;aid Ar|my; and that therein he gave pernicious Council to her Maje&s;ty, and is an Enemy to the King and King|dom.</HI></P>
<P>There were &s;ome Objections offer'd to a ge|neral Vote of this Nature, as to cen&s;uring a Nobleman upon the Word Opinion; and &s;ome, who were yet no Friends to the Earl, were, however, again&s;t it as Unju&s;t, or, at lea&s;t, Un|parliamentary, and would have had the Fact farther enquir'd into, that the Vote might have been thus, <HI>viz. It appears to this Hou&s;e, not, that it is the Opinion of this Hou&s;e:</HI> But the Que|&s;tion was carried, as it then was, by a great Majority: Upon which they pa&s;s'd the &s;econd Re&s;olution with le&s;s Difficulty, <HI>viz. That an humble Addre&s;s be pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty, that he will be graciou&s;ly pleas'd, for the Security of his Government, and of the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t in</HI> Ire|and,

<P>On the <HI>27th</HI> the Lords Ju&s;tices came to the Hou&s;e, and pa&s;&s;ing the two following Bills, <HI>(viz.)</HI> An Act for an Additional Duty on Wines, and Strong-Waters, and an Act to Attaint the <HI>Pre|tender,</HI> they made the following Speech, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

Upon this Speech the Hou&s;e of Commons fell upon the Article with great warmth and affection, and Voted an Addre&s;s to the King, expre&s;&s;ing their dete&s;tation of the Rebellion, and a&s;&s;uring his Maje&s;ty of their Fidelity to his Per&s;on, and Re&s;olution to maintain his Title to the Crown; then they Voted an Addre&s;s to the Lords Ju&s;ti|ces, full of Compliments and Thanks upon their early intimation of tho&s;e things to the Hou&s;e, and de&s;iring them to rai&s;e &s;uch Troops as may compleat the E&s;tabli&s;hment, and as many more as they &s;hould think nece&s;&s;ary for the Defence of the Kingdom; and promi&s;ing to make good the Expences; likewi&s;e, an Addre&s;s to de&s;ire a Pro|clamation with <HI>10000l.</HI> Reward for apprehending that Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> if he attempted to Land in that Kingdom; and order'd a Bill to &s;ubject the E&s;tates of the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Nonjurors,</HI> to make full Satisfaction for all the Lo&s;s and Damage which any Prote&s;tant may &s;uffer by any In&s;urrection or Inva&s;ion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And la&s;tly, an Addre&s;s that no Popi&s;h Soldiers &s;hould be &s;uffer'd to Li&s;t among the King's Troops; after which they were Ad|journ'd again 'till the <HI>8th</HI> of <HI>March</HI> following.</P>

<P><PB N="215" REF="216">
<HI>My Lords and Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P><Q>&startq;THE Zeal and Affection to my Govern|ment, and the vigilant Care for the Safe|ty of the Nation, which you have &s;hewn in your re&s;pective Counties, have not only fully an&s;wered my Expectations, but give me A&s;|&s;urances, that you are met together re&s;olved to act with a Spirit becoming a Time of com|mon Danger, and with &s;uch a Vigour, as will end in the Confu&s;ion of all tho&s;e, who have openly engag'd in this Rebellion; and in the Shame and Reproach of &s;uch as, by &s;ecret and malicious In&s;inuations, have fomented, or, by an avow'd Indifference, encouraged this Trai|terous&endq; Enterprize.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;It is, I doubt not, a great Satisfaction to you, to have ob&s;erv'd, That the Powers you entru&s;ted me with, for the Pre&s;ervation of the publick Safety, have been employ'd in the mo&s;t proper and effectual manner, and made &s;trictly &s;ub&s;ervient to tho&s;e Purpo&s;es only, for which you intended them; and you mu&s;t have had the Plea&s;ure to reflect with me, that as the Mea&s;ures taken for our Defence have been ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary, &s;o it has plea&s;ed the Divine Providence to ble&s;s them with a Series of &s;uit|able Succe&s;s: And I cannot but take this Op|portunity, of doing Ju&s;tice to the Officers and Soldiers of the Army, who&s;e brave and faith|ful Di&s;charge of their Duty, has di&s;appointed our Enemies, and contributed &s;o much to the&endq; Safety of the Nation.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="217">
<Q>&startq;I did hope, that the detecting and prevent|ing the de&s;igned In&s;urrections in &s;ome Parts of the Kingdom, and the defeating in others, tho&s;e who had taken up Arms again&s;t me, would have put an End to this Rebellion; but it is plain, that our Enemies, animated by &s;ome &s;ecret Hopes of A&s;&s;i&s;tance, are &s;till endeavouring to &s;upport this de&s;perate Un|dertaking; and the <HI>Pretender,</HI> as I have Rea&s;on&endq; to believe, is now landed in <HI>Scotland.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;It is, however, with Plea&s;ure I can acquaint you, that notwith&s;tanding the&s;e inte&s;tine Com|motions <HI>Great Britain</HI> has, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, recover'd its Influence and Reputation Abroad The Treaty for &s;ettl&s;ng the Barrier for the <HI>Ne|therlands,</HI> is now fully concluded, between the Emperor and States General, under my Guar|ranty. The King of <HI>Spain</HI> has agreed to a Treaty, by which that valuable Branch of our Commerce will be deliver'd from the new Im|po&s;itions and Hard&s;hips, to which it was &s;ub|jected by the late Treaties; and will &s;tand &s;et|tled for the future, on a Foot more advanta|geous and certain, than it ever did, in the mo&s;t floari&s;hing time of any of my Predece&s;&s;ors; and the Treaty for renewing all former Alliances, between the Crown of <HI>Great Britain</HI> and the States General, is brought very near to its&endq; Conclu&s;ion.</Q></P>

<P><Q>&startq;Among the many unavoidable ill Con&s;e|quences of this Rebellion, none affects me more &s;en&s;ibly, than that extraordinary Bur|then, which it has, and mu&s;t create to my faithful Subjects: To ea&s;e them as far as lies in my Power, I take this fir&s;t Opportunity of declaring, that I will freely give up all the E&s;tates, that &s;hall become forfeited to the Crown by this Rebellion, to be applied to|wards defraying the extraordinary Expence, in|curr'd&endq; on this Occa&s;ion.</Q></P>

In this Interval News came of the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s being Landed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the King acquaint|ed the Hou&s;e of it in the following Speech, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>My Lords and Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I Had Rea&s;on to believe, when I &s;poke la&s;t to you, that the <HI>Pretender</HI> was Landed in <HI>Scot|land;</HI> the Accounts I have received &s;ince do put it beyond all doubt, that he is Head|ing the Rebellion there, and does a&s;&s;ume the Style and Title of King of the&s;e Realms; his Adherents do likewi&s;e confidently affirm, that A&s;&s;urances are given them of Support from Abroad. This Parliament hath on all Occa&s;i|ons expre&s;&s;ed &s;o much Duty to Me, and &s;o true a Regard for the Religious and Civil Rights of my People, that, I am per&s;waded, this daring Pre&s;umption of our Enemies will heighten your ju&s;t Indignation again&s;t them, and beget &s;uch farther Re&s;olutions as, with the Ble&s;&s;ing of God,&endq; will enable me to defeat their Attempts.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Commons,</HI></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The mo&s;t effectual Way to put a &s;peedy End to the&s;e Troubles, will be to make &s;uch a Provi&s;ion as may di&s;courage any Foreign Power from a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Rebels; I do there|fore hope, that every &s;incere <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> and true <HI>Britain,</HI> will look upon the extraordinary Expence, which a timely Preparation may re|quire, to be the be&s;t Husbandry; &s;ince it will in all humane Probability, prevent that De&s;o|lation and tho&s;e Calamities, which would un|avoidably en&s;ue, if the Rebellion &s;hould be
<PB N="222" REF="223">
&s;uffered to &s;pread, and be &s;upported by <HI>Popi&s;h&endq;</HI> Forces from Abroad.</Q></P>
<P><HI>My Lords and Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The World mu&s;t be convinc'd by all you have already done, that you have nothing but the Honour and Intere&s;t of your Country at Heart; and for my own Part, I rely entirely upon you, and doubt not but you will take &s;uch Re&s;olutions at this Juncture, as will be mo&s;t for the pre&s;ent Safety, and future Ea&s;e of&endq; my People.</Q></P>
<P>This we might be a&s;&s;ured would rather quicken than delay the Fate of the Impeached Lords; they had indeed ca&s;t them&s;elves upon the King's Cle|mency, and receiv'd Sentence of Death; and great application was made to the King for their Par|don, even the Hou&s;e of Lords were brought to take part in the interce&s;&s;ion, which however the King did not think fit to grant, and it was thro' the Debates running &s;o high upon that Subject, rather ha&s;ten'd the Fate of tho&s;e, who it was en|deavour'd to &s;ave.</P>
<P>The Que&s;tion was for &s;ome time Debated, Whether it was in the King's Power to Reprieve or no in the Ca&s;e of a Sentence upon an Im|peachment. But this being carried in the Affir|mative, the Grand Motion followed in the Hou&s;e of Lords, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That an Addre&s;s be pre|&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty to grant a Reprieve to the Lords who lay in the Tower under Sentence of Death. There were long Debates upon this Sub|ject, and the Terms of the Addre&s;s took up &s;ome time; but that being agreed on, it was put to
<PB N="223" REF="224">
the Vote, <HI>to be</HI> pre&s;ented, <HI>or not</HI> pre&s;ented, and carry'd TO BE <HI>pre&s;ented</HI> by five Voices, and no more; accordingly it was pre&s;ented the &s;ame Night, being the <HI>22d</HI> of <HI>February;</HI> and the King gave an An&s;wer, which evidently &s;ignified that his Maje&s;ty was not well pleas'd with the&s;e Pro|ceedings, and by which the Lords concern'd might ea&s;ily &s;ee what they were to expect. The King's An&s;wer was: <HI>That on this and all other Oc|ca&s;ions, he would do what he thought mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent with the Dignity of his Crown, and the Safety of his People.</HI></P>
<P>The next Day, being the <HI>23d,</HI> the Effect of this Re&s;entment was more plainly &s;een, when the Orders were pa&s;t in Council for Executing Three of the Condemned Lords, <HI>viz.</HI> the Earl of <HI>Derwentwater,</HI> Earl of <HI>Nithi&s;dale,</HI> and the Vi&s;|count <HI>Kenmure,</HI> Reprieving the other Three till the <HI>7th</HI> of <HI>March;</HI> The Di&s;like of the&s;e Proceed|ings was farther &s;een in about four or five Days after; for the Order for Executing the Lords was not pa&s;t in Council without &s;ome warm Words; and the Lord Pre&s;ident, who had influenc'd the Vote in the Hou&s;e of Peers &s;o much, fail'd not to offer the like at the Council-Board: But it ended in a different manner here, the whole &s;torm of it falling upon the E. of <HI>Nott....m</HI> and his Family; for his Lord&s;hip was remov'd from his Po&s;t of Lord Pre&s;ident of the Council, as was al&s;o his Son from being one of the Trea&s;ury; his Brother the Earl of <HI>Aylesford,</HI> was remov'd from being Chancellor of the Dutchy of <HI>Lanca&s;ter;</HI> and the Lord <HI>Guern&s;ey,</HI> elde&s;t Son to the Earl of <HI>Aylesford,</HI> from being Ma&s;ter of the Jewel-Office; as al&s;o Sir <HI>Roger Mo&s;tyn,,</HI> who marry'd the Earl of
<PB N="224" REF="225">
<HI>Nottingham</HI>'s Daughter, from being one of the Tellers of the Exchequer.</P>
<P>This, however, was not done till the Lords were Executed; that is to &s;ay, two of them; for the Earl of <HI>Nithi&s;dale,</HI> happily for him, a|voided the Blow, by getting out of the Tower in Di&s;gui&s;e the very &s;ame Night, and within a very few Minutes after he had Notice, that he mu&s;t die the next Morning.</P>
<P>According to this Order of Council, early the next Morning we &s;aw the Scaffold on <HI>Tower-Hill</HI> &s;urrounded with the Hor&s;e-Guards, Hor&s;e-Grenadiers, and a Detachment of Foot; and a little before Ten a Clock, the Earl of <HI>Derwent|water,</HI> and the Lord Vi&s;count <HI>Kenmure,</HI> were carried in a Hackney-Coach from the <HI>Tower</HI> to the <HI>Tran&s;port-Office</HI> on <HI>Tower-Hill,</HI> where there was a Room hung with Black for their Reception; and there was a Pa&s;&s;age, or Gallery, rail'd in, which led from thence to the Scaffold, which was al&s;o cover'd with Black; and where, after a De|cent time for their preparation, they were both Beheaded.</P>
<P>The&s;e two Lords being thus cut off, and the third fled, the Hand of Ju&s;tice &s;taid a while; the other Three were re&s;pited from time to time, and remain &s;till in the Tower. The Earl of <HI>Nithi&s;dale</HI> having e&s;caped, an Adverti&s;ement of his E&s;cape was publi&s;h'd in the <HI>Gazette,</HI> and a Reward of a <HI>Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> offer'd to any one who &s;hould apprehend him; but there was &s;oon after an Account from <HI>France,</HI> of his being &s;afely landed there, and that he was &s;een at <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>The Cour&s;e of Things now brings the Civil and Military Matters to join in Hi&s;tory; for the
<PB N="225" REF="226">
<HI>Pretender</HI> being gone, as has been related, the King came to the Hou&s;e on the <HI>17th,</HI> of <HI>Feb|ruary,</HI> and gave the Parliament an Account of it in the following Speech.</P>
<P><HI>My Lords and Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I Take this Opportunity of acquainting you, that my Forces have oblig'd the <HI>Pretender</HI> to fly out of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and he is &s;ince, as I am in|formed, landed near <HI>Gravelines:</HI> But I don't yet know, whether any Country in Amity with us, will give him Protection, after having &s;o&endq; publickly invaded our Kingdom.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The Dangers to which the Nation was ex|po&s;ed, made me determine, that neither the extraordinary Rigour of the Sea&s;on, nor any falacious Propo&s;al of the Rebels, &s;hould divert me from u&s;ing all po&s;&s;ible Endeavours towards putting a &s;peedy and Effectual End to this un|natural&endq; Rebellion.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Commons,</HI></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I mu&s;t return you my Thanks for the great Progre&s;s you have made in the Supplies. The nece&s;&s;ary Di&s;po&s;itions are made for rai&s;ing Ad|ditional Forces: But as I &s;hall always con&s;ult the Ea&s;e of my People, as far as it is con&s;i&s;t|ent with their own Security; I &s;hall not make U&s;e of the Confidence you have placed in me, unle&s;s the re&s;tle&s;s Malice of our Enemies &s;hould make it nece&s;&s;ary to go on with tho&s;e&endq; Levies.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="227">
<HI>My Lords and Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I promi&s;e my &s;elf, from the Zeal and Wi&s;|dom of this Parliament, that the future Hap|pine&s;s and Tranquility of my Subjects will be e&s;tabli&s;h'd on a &s;olid Foundation; and &s;uch Mea&s;ures taken, as may deprive our Enemies at Home of the Power, (&s;ince that alone can deprive them of the Inclination) again to at|tempt the Di&s;turbance of my Government. This therefore is what I think my &s;elf oblig'd to recommend to you, as a Deliberation of the utmo&s;t importance to the future Safety, Ea&s;e&endq; and Pro&s;perity of my People.</Q></P>
<P>Immediately upon this Speech, the Lords and Commons &s;everally voted Addre&s;&s;es of Thanks and Congratulation, as u&s;ual: Both which, be|ing in the u&s;ual Form, we leave out for want of Room, that we may not thru&s;t out things of more Importance.</P>
<P>There was little remaining now to do, as to the Rebellion, except the puni&s;hing, and pur|&s;uing the Rebels; tho&s;e who were fallen into their Hands, we &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee brought to Ju&s;tice, by judicial Proce&s;s; tho&s;e who could not be ta|ken, the King pur&s;u'd to the utmo&s;t; at Home, by his Forces; Abroad, by his Influence.</P>
<P>The Judicial Proceedings went on all this while in the Inferior Courts, and a Commi&s;&s;ion of Oyer and Terminer was granted to Judges appointed for the Tryal of &s;uch of the <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI> Pri&s;oners as were confin'd in <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> Ca&s;tles, of whom mention was made above.</P>

In order to open their Se&s;&s;ions, the Grand Jury was &s;um|mon'd; and the proper Informations having been laid before them, Bills of Indictment were found again&s;t 48 of the Pri&s;oners by Name. <HI>It is to be Noted here,</HI> that there had been Com|mi&s;&s;ioners formerly appointed to take Depo&s;i|tions with Relation to the Fact at <HI>Pre&s;ton,</HI> and the&s;e Depo&s;itions were &s;ufficient for the Infor|mation of the Grand Jury, and to &s;atisfy them in finding the Bills, tho' upon the Tryals the Witne&s;&s;es were produced in Court, as is u&s;ual in &s;uch Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>The Bills being found, Copies of the Indict|ment were deliver'd to the Per&s;ons, and the Court adjourn'd for 8 Days, <HI>viz.</HI> to the 20th of <HI>January,</HI> to give the Pri&s;oners the legal Time to prepare for their Defence.

But a Clau&s;e in an Act of Parliament regulated this, and a Commi&s;&s;ion of Oyer and Terminer was granted to Try them in <HI>London.</HI> Accordingly, on the <HI>7th</HI> of <HI>April</HI> the Judges &s;at in the Common-Pleas Court at <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter,</HI> where Bills were found again&s;t &s;ome of them, and they were Arraigned, and had time given them to prepare for their Tryals. The Grand Jury of <HI>Surry</HI> at the &s;ame time found Bills again&s;t others of them, <HI>(viz.)</HI> &s;uch as were Pri&s;oners in the <HI>Mar&s;hal&s;ea.</HI></P>
<P>In the interval between the Grand-Jury's find|ing the Bills, and the Pri&s;oners being brought to the Bar to be Arraign'd, Mr. <HI>For&s;ter</HI> the Head of the <HI>Northumberland</HI> and <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI> Army gave them the flip; for having obtain'd the Favour not to be Lodg'd in the Pre&s;s-yard at Newgate, but in the Keeper's Hou&s;e, he put a Trick upon his Keeper's Man, by &s;ending him down Stairs into the Cellar to draw Beer, and having fa&s;ten'd him down by the Stair-head Door, and having prepar'd a Counterfeit Key to the main Door, he let him&s;elf out, and then putting the Key in|to the Door again on the out&s;ide, he double lock'd the Door, and left the Key in it; &s;o that the Keeper Mr. <HI>Pitts,</HI> tho' he had pre&s;ently di&s;|cover'd it, could not get out to pur&s;ue him 'till it was too late: It was afterwards known that Mr. <HI>For&s;ter</HI> had convey'd him&s;elf down to <HI>Leigh</HI> in <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> where a Ve&s;&s;el lay ready for him, which

carry'd him to <HI>France,</HI> and Landed him &s;o hap|pily, that in 24 Hours he was a Pri&s;oner in <HI>New|gate,</HI> and a Freeman in <HI>Calais.</HI> There was a Proclamation immediately publi&s;h'd, with a Re|ward of a Thou&s;and Pound for Apprehending him, but he was out of their reach; this was the <HI>14th</HI> of <HI>April.</HI></P>
<P>Nor was this all, for a few Days after, and ju&s;t the Evening before the Tryals were to begin, there had like to have been a general Goal-De|liver at Newgate; for old Brigadier <HI>Mackinto&s;h,</HI> who &s;aw that Mr. <HI>For&s;ter</HI> being gone, he was like to be the fir&s;t Man to be made an Example of, broke out of Newgate; not by &s;light, as the other had done, but by meer Force, knocking down the Keepers, breaking thro' the Soldiers, and taking the Keys from the Turn-Key who kept the Door. This was done with &s;uch de&s;pe|rate Courage, and he was &s;o well Seconded by his Fellow-Pri&s;oners, that above 30 of them got out of the Pri&s;on, into the Keeper's Hou&s;e, and about 17 of them, quite out of the Keepers Door.</P>
<P>The Old Brigadier got quite off, with 7 more, but the re&s;t taking the wrong way in the Court, after they were out, and not able to find their way into the Street, were taken again. The Names of tho&s;e who e&s;caped were</P>

<P>The Court was appointed to Sit that Day; but upon this Occa&s;ion it was put off to the <HI>7th,</HI> when they began in Earne&s;t with them: Fourteen more were arraigned, who al&s;o pleaded <HI>Not Guilty,</HI> and de&s;ired Time, as others had done, which was granted them. The fir&s;t Man brought to Tryal, was Colonel <HI>Oxbourgh:</HI> This was the Gentleman who came out to General <HI>Carpenter</HI> from <HI>Pre&s;ton,</HI> and offer'd to Capitulate, and at la&s;t agreed for them to Surrender; all which the Witne&s;&s;es prov'd upon the Tryal: His Defence turn'd chiefly, (1.) Upon his not having acted but as a Mediator, to bring them to Sur|render. And, (2.) upon the yielding at Di&s;|cretion, being to be under&s;tood to be a Capitula|tion for Life. But the Generals and Officers proving, that no Promi&s;es of Life were made; the Jury brought him in <HI>Guilty.</HI></P>
<P>He was likewi&s;e told by the Court, that a Man being found among Rebels, any Way aid|ing, abetting, comforting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> though he was not actually in Arms, or committed Ho&s;ti|lities, yet it was Trea&s;on within the Law; and that the part of a Mediator, as it &s;hew'd the Confidence the Rebels plac'd in him, &s;o it was prov'd he Capitulated for him&s;elf, as well as the re&s;t.</P>
<P>We &s;et the&s;e things down more particularly in this Gentleman's Ca&s;e; becau&s;e this, of ha|ving Capitulated, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the Plea of being Forced into the Rebellion, was the Sub&s;tance of what was pleaded by mo&s;t of the re&s;t, who&s;e

<P>The vigorous Pro&s;ecution and Puni&s;hment of the&s;e Men, alarm'd the Party, and gave Ground to expect a farther Cour&s;e of judicial Proceed|ings; as was al&s;o vi&s;ible from the &s;trict Enquiry into other Things and Per&s;ons: For Example, That of Committing Mr. <HI>Harvey</HI> of <HI>Comb</HI> to

<P>There was one great &s;truggle yet in Parlia|ment, after which Things began to draw to|wards a Clo&s;e; and this was the Propo&s;al; To bring in a Bill to prolong the Time for the Sit|ting of the Parliament. It was well known the Parliament could by Virtue of the Triennial Law &s;ub&s;i&s;t but three Years; but it was thought convenient for divers rea&s;ons of State, not to acquie&s;ce in the Circum&s;tances; and therefore a Bill was offered to continue the Parliament then Sitting to a farther Time, <HI>(viz.)</HI> for Seven Years.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="242">
This Bill was fir&s;t brought into the Hou&s;e of Lords, where after long &s;truggles, and two Pro|te&s;ts it was pa&s;s'd in the Committee 96 again&s;t 61, and at la&s;t in the Hou&s;e by 69 again&s;t 36. In the Hou&s;e of Commons it was not &s;o much con|tended, where the Difference being at highe&s;t, was 284, again&s;t 162.</P>
<P>After this the Hou&s;es had little of Moment before them, except what they call winding up their bottom; that is to &s;ay, pa&s;&s;ing the Bills which were depending in the Hou&s;e, which be|ing all brought to perfection by the latter end of <HI>June</HI> the King came to the Hou&s;e the <HI>26th,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ing all their Bills, put an end to the Se&s;|&s;ion with the following Speech.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;<HI>My Lords and Gentlemen,</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I Cannot put an End to this Se&s;&s;ion, with|out expre&s;&s;ing to you my Satisfaction in the Proceedings of this Parliament.

<P>As to the Parliament of <HI>Ireland,</HI> they went on as before, proceeding with great rigor again&s;t the Mi&s;carriages of the former reign, bringing their own Members (e&s;pecially) to Submi&s;&s;ions and Cen&s;ures, and al&s;o &s;everal others.</P>
<P>I have given &s;ome account of their Re&s;ent|ment again&s;t tho&s;e who Addre&s;s'd in favour of Sir <HI>Con&s;tantine Phipps,</HI> and who advis'd the Queen to prorogue the Parliament.

<P>Fir&s;t they Re&s;olv'd, That &s;oon after the Ar|rival of Sir <HI>Con&s;tantine Phipps,</HI> late Lord Chan|cellar, <HI>viz.</HI> in the Year 1710. a De&s;ign was form'd, and carry'd on, to &s;ubvert the Con&s;ti|tution, and Freedom of Elections of Magi&s;trates of Corporations, in order to procure Per&s;ons to be return'd for Members of Parliament, di&s;af|fected to the Settlement of the Crown on his Maje&s;ty, and his Royal I&s;&s;ue: and that, in pur|&s;uance of that De&s;ign, indirect and illegal Me|thods were taken to &s;ubvert the ancient and legal Cour&s;e of electing Magi&s;trate in the City of <HI>Dublin.</HI></P>
<P>That, in pur&s;uance of that De&s;ign, they pro|cured, in le&s;s than five Months, in the Year 1711.

<P>That the &s;aid &s;enior Alderman had no Right to be elected, either by Charter, U&s;age, or any By-Law in force in the &s;aid City.</P>

<P>The Lords Ju&s;tices Speech on this Occa&s;ion, was as follows.</P>
<P><HI>My Lords and Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P><Q>&startq;THOUGH the Se&s;&s;ions has, by many unavoidable Accidents been protracted to an unu&s;ual Length, you cannot but think your Time well imployed, having reaped the Advantages of the many good Laws his Ma|je&s;ty has been plea&s;ed to give you; in which Number the <HI>Act for making the Militia more u&s;eful,</HI> is a &s;ingular In&s;tance of the great Con|fidence his Maje&s;ty Places in the Fidelity and good Affection of his loyal Subjects of <HI>Ire|land,</HI> and will greatly contribute to the Secu|rity of the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t of this King|dom.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Commons,</HI></P>
<P><Q>&startq;We are commanded by his Maje&s;ty, to re|turn you Thanks for the Supplies you have &s;o chearfully granted for his Service, and your own Defence; which, we a&s;&s;ure you, will be ap|plied with the utmo&s;t Frugality to the Purpo|&s;es&endq; for which they were given.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;We mu&s;t likewi&s;e thankfully acknowledge the &s;everal Marks of Confidence you have pla|ced in us; more particularly, your &s;ea&s;onable and unprecedented Vote of Credit, which will
<PB N="250" REF="251">
remain a memorable Proof of your unbounded Zeal for his Maje&s;ty's Service; and an Obliga|tion upon us, to continue our be&s;t Endeavours&endq; for your Pro&s;perity.</Q></P>
<P><HI>My Lords and Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The Sea&s;on of the Year is now far advanced, and it is time you &s;hould return to your &s;eve|ral Countries; where you will take Care, in your re&s;pective Stations, to &s;ee the Laws duly put in Execution, for the Support of our ex|cellent Con&s;titution both in Church and State. We &s;hall recommend to you, the Continuance of that Unanimity and Re&s;olution, which have hitherto pre&s;erved you in perfect Tranquility, and will be&s;t enable you to defeat the futre De|&s;igns&endq; of your open and &s;ecret Enemies.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;It is a great Plea&s;ure to us, to &s;ee this Se&s;|&s;ion conclude as it began, with all po&s;&s;ible Marks of Loyalty and good Affection to his Maje&s;ty; and as we have con&s;tantly repre&s;ented the Merit of &s;o good a People in a ju&s;t Light, to the be&s;t of Princes; &s;o we have his Maje&s;ty's Commands, to a&s;&s;ure you of his perfect Sati&s;|faction&endq; in your dutiful Behaviour.</Q></P>
<P>At the End of this Year it was that the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> fell under the Royal Di&s;plea&s;ure, and was remov'd from all his great Offices and Employments, which were indeed very great ones; for he was at the &s;ame time General and Commander in Chief of all his Maje&s;ties Forces in <HI>Scotland,</HI> Lord Lieutenant of the Shire of <HI>Dunbarton</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and of <HI>Surrey</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> Colonel of the Royal Regiment of Hor&s;e, Go|vernor

of <HI>Port Mahone,</HI> and of the I&s;land of <HI>Mi|norca,</HI> Knight of the Garter, one of the Privy Council, and fir&s;t Lord of the Bedchamber to the Prince; enjoying be&s;ides all the&s;e, a Pen&s;ion of 2000 <HI>l. per Ann,</HI> from the King; of all which, except Knight of the Garter, he was di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s'd at once; the Rea&s;ons and Occa&s;ion is not my bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire, being not matter of Hi&s;tory at this time.</P>
<P>The King was now preparing for his Jour|ney or Voyage to <HI>Hanover;</HI> in order to which the Bill above-mention'd had been pa&s;s'd, and of which his Maje&s;ty had made mention in his Speech: Preparatory to this Voyage, a Patent pa&s;s'd the Seal, Creating the Prince of Wales <HI>Guardian of the Kingdom, and his Maje&s;ties Lieu|tenant in the &s;ame.</HI></P>
<P>It was on the 7th of <HI>July</HI> that the King &s;et forward, and going by Barge to <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> his Maje&s;ty embark'd there on Board a Yacht, a Squadron of Men of War lying at the <HI>Buoy on the Nore</HI> ready to join; and on the 9th the King Landed in <HI>Holland,</HI> at the <HI>Brill;</HI> from whence he went on Board one of the States Yachts to <HI>Utrecht,</HI> where he took Coach, and arriv'd at <HI>Hanover</HI> the 12th.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the News of the King's arriving in <HI>Holland</HI> came to Court, the Regent open'd his Commi&s;&s;ion. One of the fir&s;t things which oc|curr'd in this new Admini&s;tration, was indeed very &s;urprizing for a time, <HI>viz.</HI> that on the 8th, a dead Warrant was &s;ign'd for executing 24 of the State Pri&s;oners, who lay then under Sentence, but had mo&s;t of them been repriev'd by the King; the Time of their Execution was ap|pointed for the <HI>Friday</HI> after, when, it &s;eems,
<PB N="252" REF="253">
their former Reprieves expir'd; whether it was matter of Form, and that it was nece&s;&s;ary to proceed in that manner, or whether it was in order to alarm the Pri&s;oners, who, &s;ome &s;aid, began to behave as if they were &s;ecure, we know not; but the Surprize la&s;ted no longer than the <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> after, when a Reprieve came down for Twenty two of them; the other Two, being Mr. <HI>Paul</HI> the Clergyman, and Mr. <HI>Hall,</HI> for|merly a Ju&s;tice of Peace near <HI>Otterburn</HI> in <HI>Nor|thumberland,</HI> were appointed to be put to Death.</P>
<P>Accordingly, on the <HI>13th,</HI> at the u&s;ual time, they were brought to the Place of Execution, where, after reading their Papers to the People, they deliver'd them to the Sheriff, and de&s;ir'd they might be printed: &s;ignifying at the &s;ame Time, that they had given out Copies, which if the Sheriff declin'd to Print, the other would neverthele&s;s be made publick: The She|riff an&s;wer'd, he &s;hould lay their Reque&s;t and their Papers al&s;o before the Secretaries of State, and Act as he &s;hould be directed. After which, they were executed according to their Sentence.</P>
<P>And thus I conclude the Second Year of this brief Hi&s;tory.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Anno</HI> 1717.</HEAD>
<P>_THIS Year the Scene alters, and the Face of Affairs is chang'd; as the la&s;t Year's began with Tumults and Riot, Di&s;&s;affection, and even Re|bellion: This begins with Tri|umph and Satisfaction; the King's Affairs e&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves upon the Ruin of the In&s;urrection and Di&s;tractions of the la&s;t Year, his Arms being every where victorious; and many of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the di&s;affected being fallen into his Hands, His Maje&s;ty has more Exerci&s;e now for the Sword of his Ju&s;tice, than the Sword of War, and for his Clemency, than his An|ger.</P>
<P>Not but that even in this Year there were &s;ome Remains &s;een of the Spirit of Di&s;&s;atisfaction; the People were conquer'd, who had been in Arms, and the re&s;t were taught by Experience, that

the King was not to be attack'd that way; yet it was impo&s;&s;ible &s;o entirely to check the great Di&s;&s;af|fection which had been &s;pread among the People, as that no Remains of it &s;hould appear; but this mu&s;t be added, that whenever any &s;uch Excur&s;ions were made, it always ended to the Di&s;advantage of tho&s;e that were concern'd. I &s;hall give a brief Account of &s;everal Attempts to di&s;turb the Peace, which happen'd about this Time; but to enter in|to a long Detail of the manner how every little Fray of this Sort was began and ended, that I hope will not be expected, except of tho&s;e volu|minous Writers, who want Matter to fill up their yearly Labours, which at pre&s;ent is not my Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>The King, as has been ob&s;erv'd, at the Conclu|&s;ion of the la&s;t Year was Abroad; the Government was left in the Hands of the Prince, as &s;ole Re|gent; but acting by the Agency of the old Privy Council: The People had particularly, for &s;ome Time pa&s;t, apply'd them&s;elves on every Rejoicing-Day, <HI>of which we are now pretty full,</HI> to Street-Quarrels, Mobs, Riots and Tumults, in a very un|accountable Manner, and &s;uch as even tended to a new In&s;urrection.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e had been at <HI>Cambridge</HI> on the 28th of <HI>May</HI> la&s;t, which was the King's Birth-Day, and the 29th of <HI>May,</HI> which was the Anniver&s;ary of the Re&s;toration; the Ca&s;e was heard judicially, and both &s;ides were cen&s;ur'd, as indeed both de|&s;erv'd; but this gave great Offence to &s;ome People, whether it was, that they expected no Body &s;hould be allow'd to be tumultuous but them&s;elves, or that they thought the Subject, <HI>viz.</HI> the King's Birth-Day gave them a Loo&s;e to be di&s;orderly, that I do not determine; but the Judicature of the Univer|&s;ity condemn'd the Parties on both &s;ides to be &s;u&s;|pended

for a Year, and if they offended a &s;econd time, to be expell'd.</P>
<P>This fell hard upon &s;ome of the Members of <HI>Clare-Hall,</HI> where Fame &s;ays the Fray began, but who it &s;eems thought, that being on the right Side, the Superiors dur&s;t not cen&s;ure them; in which they found them&s;elves mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>But the next Rabble was not &s;o ea&s;ily &s;uppre&s;s'd, nor &s;o cheaply an&s;wer'd for; the <HI>Whigs</HI> (in <HI>London</HI> e&s;pecially) had &s;et up their &s;everal Rendezvous, for Rabbling, in Places proper for their Turn, as if they had been a &s;tated Garri&s;on for the City, kept up to pre&s;erve the Places, and that the&s;e were the &s;everal Head Quarters: The&s;e they call <HI>Mug-Hou&s;es,</HI> Things which however the People might mean well to the Government, and the Government might at fir&s;t encourage them, or at lea&s;t wink at them; yet their Method appearing to be, in the very Nature of it, incon&s;i&s;tent with the Publick Peace, and the good Order which every civil Government is ob|lig'd to maintain, and &s;everal Irregularities and Breaches of the Peace having happened, in Con|&s;equence of their mi&s;taken Loyalty, to &s;ay no more of them; the Government has &s;ince thought it con|venient, not to take it ill that they drop and decay of them&s;elves.</P>

Riot and Tumults, let it be for what Cau&s;e or Par|ty it will.</P>
<P>On the <HI>25th</HI> of <HI>July,</HI> the Friends of the <HI>Tory-Hou&s;e</HI> a&s;&s;embled in the Street, re&s;enting &s;ome Inju|ry done to the Hou&s;e they u&s;ed to a&s;&s;emble at for &s;ome Days; the <HI>Whig-Hou&s;e</HI> had been Aggre&s;&s;ors, but be that as it will, the&s;e certainly went beyond their Bounds, threatning and in&s;ulting the <HI>Whig-Hou&s;e</HI> the fir&s;t Day: However, they were beaten off, and &s;o they laid a&s;ide their Enterpri&s;e for that Night: But came early the next Morning, reinfor|ced by Detachments from all Parts, <HI>for Rabbling was at this time come to a very great Height.</HI> There were &s;ome Scuffles fir&s;t in the Streets, and the <HI>Tory-Hou&s;e,</HI> of which mention is made, had its Sign broken and defaced, the Windows demoli&s;h'd, and the like; but the Rabble increa&s;ing, the <HI>Mug-Hou&s;e</HI> People were forced to retreat; in this Part of the Fray, one <HI>Read,</HI> the Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Mug-Hou&s;e,</HI> with a Firelock in his Hand, advancing to the Head of his Men, fir'd, and &s;hot one <HI>Daniel Vaughan,</HI> for|merly a <HI>Bridewell</HI> Servant, through the Body, of which he fell Dead upon the Spot; but the Rabble, rather enrag'd than di&s;pirited by it, carried on their Attack with the more Fury, and by downright Force enter'd the Hou&s;e, plundered all below Stairs, de|&s;troy'd the Drink in the Cellar, and every thing they could break or &s;poil; but they were repuls'd in their Attempt to force their way up Stairs, by &s;ome People who had barricaded the Head of the Stairs, and defended them ob&s;tinately. In the mean time, notice being &s;ent to <HI>Whitehall,</HI> a Detachment of the Guards came immediately to the Place, and, tho' not without &s;ome Difficulty, the Rabble was di&s;per|&s;ed; the People &s;eparated, and Seven or Eight of them being taken <HI>in the very act</HI> of a&s;&s;aulting the Hou&s;e, were carried to Pri&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="270">
As I profe&s;s the Office here of a Hi&s;torian only, I &s;hall not enter into the Reflections on either Side in this Affair, but only relate, that this being an extra|ordinary Ca&s;e, and the King being abroad, it made the Government re&s;olve to &s;hew their Re&s;entment in a Severity that might be a Warning and Example to others. Accordingly five Per&s;ons taken in this hurly burly, were forthwith brought to Tryal at the <HI>Old-Baily,</HI> and being all convicted, they were Executed at the Corner or End of the Street where the Fray happen'd.</P>
<P>They were all Youths of ordinary Circum&s;tances, mean, de&s;picable, and would hardly have all &s;uf|fer'd, but that the unhappy Circum&s;tance of the Time made it nece&s;&s;ary: Their Names were as fol|lows, <HI>(viz.) Thomas Bean, George Purcha&s;e, John Love, Richard Price</HI> and <HI>William Price:</HI> There was one <HI>Daniel Delander,</HI> a Watch-maker, Try'd and found Guilty of being a Party in the &s;ame Riot, but Mercy interpo&s;ed, the Publick Ju&s;tice being &s;a|tisfied with the Executions above.</P>
<P>The Rebellion being now at an End, and the prin|cipal Per&s;ons that the Government had their Eyes upon, being Executed, or under Sentence of Death, the Government had little before them for &s;ome Time, but to receive the Congratulations of the Subjects in Addre&s;&s;es, which came from all Parts; and the Government in Return exerci&s;ed &s;ome Acts of Clemency, particularly the relea&s;ing out of Pri&s;on all the Servants who were in Cu&s;tody, as being Per|&s;ons &s;uppo&s;ed to be led into the Snare by the Com|mands of their Ma&s;ters, or at lea&s;t in Con&s;equence of their particular Services, and con&s;equently not altogether &s;o Guilty as their Ma&s;ters; the&s;e were a|bout forty in number, <HI>(viz.)</HI> eleven out of <HI>Newgate,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="271">
twelve out of the <HI>Fleet,</HI> and &s;eventeen out of the <HI>Mar&s;hal&s;ea.</HI></P>
<P>With the&s;e Acts of Clemency, however, the Ju|dicial Proceedings went on in their Cour&s;e, and the mo&s;t remarkable Tryal was that of Mr. <HI>Pitts</HI> the Keeper of <HI>Newgate,</HI> who was Indicted for <HI>High-Trea&s;on,</HI> and Try'd on the &s;ame at the <HI>Old-Baily,</HI> the Charge being for wilfully &s;uffering the Pri&s;oners under his keeping to E&s;cape, <HI>(viz.)</HI> Mr. <HI>Fo&s;ter, Mac-Into&s;h,</HI> and others, but after a long Tryal, and a full hearing on all Sides, the Jury brought in their Verdict NOT GUILTY: So he was immediately Di&s;charg'd, and returned to his Po&s;t, where he &s;till remains.</P>
<P>Abundance of Printers, Publi&s;hers and Hawkers, came under Cogni&s;ance, for printing and publi&s;hing &s;candalous Lampoons, Satyrs, Libels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But neither their Names or Crimes are &s;o remarkable, as to require their being nam'd here, except one Mr. <HI>Redmayne,</HI> a Printer, who&s;e Ca&s;e being very particular, will come to be &s;poken of again on other Accounts of the like Nature.</P>
<P>It was within a little matter of rai&s;ing another Tumult, that the Friends of <HI>Tho. Bean,</HI> one of the Five who were thus Executed, had the Imprudence, <HI>to call it no wor&s;e,</HI> to make a pompous and popular Funeral for him; having &s;ix young Maids to bear up the Pall, with white Scarfs and Favours, and &s;ix young Men to lead them. Nor was this all, but the next <HI>Sabbath-Day,</HI> the &s;ame Twelve came in Cou|ples to St. <HI>Bride</HI>'s Church, with their Scarfs and Favours, which drew a great Crowd together, and that had ended in more Di&s;orders, the Mob be|ginning to reflect upon the Barbarity, as they call'd it, of the Execution: But the Train'd Bands
<PB N="7" REF="272">
of the City, a Company whereof were po&s;ted in <HI>Salisbury-Court,</HI> fell lu&s;tily upon the Rabble, and the young Men and Maids, tho' being with what &s;peed they could gotten as far as <HI>Black Friars</HI> Stairs to take Water, were overtaken by a Party of Sol|diers &s;ent after them, who apprehended Five of them, but the re&s;t e&s;caped; the&s;e were afterwards Tried at the <HI>Old-Baily,</HI> and being found Guilty, were fin'd 20 <HI>Marks</HI> each, but with an Intimation, that the Court inclined to remit or abate their Fines, if they would acknowledge their Crime, and di&s;cover ingeniou&s;ly who &s;et them on Work; but they all &s;tood out, and lay in <HI>Newgate</HI> till &s;ome of their Friends gather'd Money enough for them to pay their Fine.</P>
<P>And now in pro&s;ecuting the Pri&s;oners taken in the Rebellion, it came in Cour&s;e to con&s;ider what &s;hould be done with tho&s;e in the North, where the Pri&s;ons were full of them, and where none had been yet Try'd, much le&s;s Executed, tho&s;e in <HI>Lanca&s;hire</HI> ex|cepted.</P>
<P>Of the Number I now &s;peak, all the meaner Sort had been Di&s;charg'd, as particularly 353 which were at <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> and 160 out of the Pri&s;ons at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> had been all let go, but the Gentlemen and Leading Men which were in Cu&s;tody required to be farther con&s;ider'd.</P>
<P>After &s;ome Time, and &s;everal long Debates, it was Re&s;olv'd thus: 1. That the Pri&s;oners in the &s;e|veral Pri&s;ons of <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Che&s;ter-Ca&s;tle,</HI> e&s;pe|cially &s;uch as had declined Tran&s;portation, as &s;eve|ral of them had, &s;hould now be Tried in the ordi|nary Courts of Ju&s;tice at the A&s;&s;izes in <HI>Lanca&s;hire;</HI> and as for the Pri&s;oners in <HI>Scotland,</HI> they &s;hould be all brought to <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> and be Try'd there by a &s;pe|cial Commi&s;&s;ion granted for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="273">
According to the fir&s;t Re&s;olution, the Summer A&s;&s;izes being now at hand, the Pri&s;oners in <HI>Che&s;ter-Ca&s;tle</HI> were carried to <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> where &s;everal of them were Try'd as follows, <HI>(viz.)</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Shuttleworth</HI> of <HI>Al&s;ton,</HI> Mr. <HI>John Swarbreck</HI> of <HI>We&s;ham, Richard Hodg&s;on</HI> of <HI>Walton, William Charnley</HI> of <HI>Walton;</HI> convicted upon Tryal.</P>
<P><HI>John Winkley</HI> of <HI>Al&s;ton, Thomas Park</HI> of <HI>Cro&s;ton, Henry Winkley</HI> of <HI>Al&s;ton,</HI> Captain <HI>John Bruce</HI> of <HI>Pre&s;ton, Laurence Coop</HI> of <HI>Walton;</HI> withdrew their Pleas, and pleaded Guilty.</P>
<P><HI>Robert Walker</HI> of <HI>Forton,</HI> Mr. <HI>John Daniel Dur|ton. John Wareing</HI> of <HI>Aighton, Richard Singleton</HI> of <HI>Kirkham,</HI> acquitted upon Tryal.</P>
<P><HI>George Coop</HI> and <HI>Richard Abbot</HI> were al&s;o clear|ed by the Jury, though there &s;eem'd plain Proof enough again&s;t them</P>
<P><HI>Lawrence Thrope</HI> of <HI>Fi&s;hwick, Hugh Barton</HI> of <HI>Claughton, Richard Walm&s;ley</HI> of <HI>Walton,</HI> were ac|quitted for want of due Proof.</P>
<P><HI>William $$esketh</HI> of <HI>Maines,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> <HI>William Ward</HI> of <HI>Manche&s;ter,</HI> Rioter, <HI>Edward Burrow</HI> of <HI>Weeton,</HI> were re&s;pited till next A&s;&s;izes.</P>
<P>By the Temper of the Jury, which appear'd in the Tryal of the fir&s;t five, the Judges plainly per|ceiv'd the Ca&s;e was quite alter'd in that Country, and that this manner of proceeding would not do by any means; and in &s;hort, that if the Tryals were to go on, the whole Number would be acquitted, let the Evidence be as it would I &s;ay, the Judges &s;eeing this, thought fit to put an End to the Proceedings, and break up the A&s;&s;izes.</P>
<P>Of the condemn'd Per&s;ons, five were Executed the <HI>2d</HI> of <HI>October; viz.</HI> three at <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> and two at <HI>Pre&s;ton;</HI> their Names were, Captain <HI>Bruce,</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="274">
<HI>Tho. Shuttleworth, John Winkley, William Charnley,</HI> and <HI>Richard Hodg&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>This Captain <HI>Bruce</HI> was a <HI>Scot&s;man,</HI> had for|merly been a Steward or Rent-gatherer to Duke <HI>Ha|milton,</HI> but was on &s;ome private Breach with that Family, turn'd out of the Duke's Bu&s;ine&s;s, and liv'd at <HI>Pre&s;ton;</HI> where, when the Rebels took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that Town, he openly declar'd him&s;elf, and took Arms with them.</P>
<P>This Part being over, the re&s;t of the Pri&s;oners were remanded for the pre&s;ent, and mo&s;t of them lay in Cu&s;tody till relea&s;ed by the General Pardon, which came out &s;ome Months after this.</P>
<P>It comes next in order to mention what was done with the Pri&s;oners in <HI>Scotland,</HI> which in particular occa&s;ion'd &s;ome warm Debates, &s;ome alledging, that they ought not to be removed, but that by the Treaty of Union, which re&s;erved all the <HI>Scots</HI> Judi|catures entire, they ought to be Try'd in <HI>Scotland:</HI> Likewi&s;e &s;ome of the Pri&s;oners in&s;i&s;ted, and &s;hewed great Reluctance at their being ordered to remove.</P>
<P>However, po&s;itive Orders being &s;ent to General <HI>Carpenter,</HI> who then commanded in Chief in <HI>Scot|land,</HI> he gave them Notice to prepare, and tho' in Civility he gave them all the Time he could, and particularly he gave them time to &s;end up their Peti|tion or Repre&s;entation to the King and Council, yet upon the Return of the Expre&s;s, and their Re|que&s;t not being granted, he was obliged to remove them, and accordingly the <HI>2d</HI> and <HI>3d</HI> of <HI>September</HI> they &s;et forward, with this Exception however, that he &s;uffered &s;ome to remain behind, who were Di|&s;temper'd and unfit to Travel, as particularly Dr. <HI>Gairns,</HI> Dr. <HI>Carmichael,</HI> and one Mr. <HI>Ogilvy.</HI></P>

<P>The Guards which conducted them were, <HI>Mon|tague's</HI> Regiment of Foot, and General <HI>Carpenter</HI>'s own Regiment of Dragoons; and thus being on their Journey, we &s;hall leave them for a Time, till we hear of them afterwards in a Judicial Way at
<PB N="14" REF="279">
<HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> whither a Commi&s;&s;ion of Oyer and Termi|ner being &s;ent for their Trial, the proper Officers prepar'd to go down thither, to hold a Court of Ju&s;tice for that Purpo&s;e; and abundance of People, as well <HI>Highlanders</HI> as others, were order'd from the <HI>Savoy,</HI> where they had been kept together &s;ome Time, to go down to <HI>Carli&s;le</HI> under a Guard, to give Evidence in the Trials appointed there.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the three &s;ick Gentlemen, there were left behind, the Lord Vi&s;count <HI>Strathallan,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Rollo,</HI> as Peers, and Marque&s;s of <HI>Huntley,</HI> Son to the Duke of <HI>Gordon,</HI> claim'd to be left behind; but it was referr'd to the Lord Advocate, and other Lawyers, who gave it again&s;t him; &s;o he &s;et for|ward with the re&s;t, but was by an Expre&s;s from <HI>London,</HI> which met them on the Road, allowed to go back to the Ca&s;tle, from whence he was &s;ome Time after relea&s;ed, by a particular Pardon to him|&s;elf, under the Great Seal.</P>
<P>Some others al&s;o prevented their Fate, by break|ing Pri&s;on at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> a few Days before, as par|ticularly Sir <HI>David Thripland</HI>'s Son, Mr.<HI>&mdash;Wil&s;on,</HI> a Mathematician, with two Servants al&s;o;<HI>&mdash;Bethune</HI> of <HI>Balfour,</HI> Son in-Law to General <HI>Hamilton,&mdash;Menzies</HI> of <HI>Pitfodels,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hut|chins,</HI> Provo&s;t of <HI>Aborbrothick.</HI></P>
<P>As the Pri&s;oners arrived at <HI>Carli&s;le</HI> the 12th of <HI>September,</HI> the Judges appointed to try them ar|rived there the fir&s;t of <HI>December</HI> following. An Account of their Proceedings I &s;hall take in its Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>I come now to another kind of civil War, which employ'd the Pens, as the former had done the Swords of the Parties, and which has indeed run a farther length than a thing of that Nature could have been expected: This civil War began chiefly
<PB N="15" REF="280">
among the Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks, tho' it proceeded to em|bark the Government, and a great many private Per|&s;ons afterwards in the Quarrel: It con&s;i&s;ted of two Parts; tho' I mu&s;t acknowledge it to be in the main but one and the &s;ame Quarrel: The <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> was the Charge of Schi&s;m ca&s;t upon, or brought again&s;t all the Clergy of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> on Account of their breaking off from the Nonjuring Church, which it was in&s;i&s;ted, was the only rightful Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>This Conte&s;t was began and &s;tated in a clear Draught, in Form of a Con&s;titution, by that very learned Per&s;on Doctor <HI>Hicks,</HI> a Per&s;on eminent for Learning, exemplar for Life, and &s;aving this par|ticular Affair, an unexceptionable Man, even among his Enemies.</P>
<P>He had in his Life-time publi&s;hed the&s;e Con&s;titu|tions, and this will bring, <HI>as I &s;aid before,</HI> the Story of Mr. <HI>Redmayne,</HI> the Printer, on the Stage again, for one Mr. <HI>Howell,</HI> a Clergyman, and al&s;o a Non|juror, had written a Book, Entituled, <HI>The Ca&s;e of Schi&s;m in the Church of England con&s;idered;</HI> he had not only written, but had printed it at Mr. <HI>Redmayne</HI>'s Printing-Hou&s;e, in <HI>Jewen-Street;</HI> where the Govern|ment having Information of it, &s;ome of them were &s;eized: The Me&s;&s;enger having likewi&s;e a Warrant to apprehend Mr. <HI>Howell,</HI> he was al&s;o taken up, and his Papers &s;eized.</P>
<P>Among his Papers were al&s;o found his Letters of Ordination, being an Original In&s;trument; by which it appears, that he received Prie&s;t's Orders, with In&s;titution, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> at the Hands of the late Dr.<HI>Hicks;</HI> who, as appears by tho&s;e In&s;truments, &s;tiled him&s;elf Suffragan Bi&s;hop of <HI>Thetford.</HI> There was al&s;o a Form of Ab&s;olution, and Reception of
<PB N="16" REF="281">
Converts and Penitents, returning from the &s;up|po&s;ed Schi&s;m, as on their being receiv'd into the Nonjurors Church.</P>
<P>But while the Town was amu&s;ed with this bold Attempt of Mr. <HI>Howell's,</HI> one of the King's Me&s;|&s;engers being in que&s;t of &s;ome other Pamphlet, and &s;earching the Hou&s;e of the &s;aid Mr. <HI>Redmayne</HI> the Printer, in <HI>Jewin-Street,</HI> happen'd upon another thing of ten Thou&s;and times the Con&s;equence of this of Mr. <HI>Howell</HI>'s, and of which Mr. <HI>Howell</HI> &s;eem'd to be only a Deducter or Abridger. This was the Book containing <HI>the Con&s;titution</HI> mentioned above, and &s;aid to be written by the &s;aid Dr. <HI>Hicks.</HI> The Me&s;&s;enger found but one Copy, the re&s;t of the Impre&s;&s;ion being conveyed away before he came; however, this one Book was &s;ufficient to di&s;cover to the Government that &s;uch a Thing was on Foot, and had been publi&s;hed; and was &s;ufficient al&s;o to bring the Printer upon the Stage, in order to a far|ther Enquiry into the Particulars: The Book is en|tituled, <HI>The Con&s;titution of the Catholick Church, and the Nature and Con&s;equences of Schi&s;m, &s;et forth in a Collection of Papers written by the R. Re|verend</HI> George Hicks, <HI>D. D.</HI></P>
<P>The Contents of the&s;e Books are too long to be brought into a Collection of Facts; and as the&s;e make no Part of Hi&s;tory, I refer the Reader to the Books them&s;elves: But as to the Ordination of Mr. <HI>Howell,</HI> by the &s;aid Dr. <HI>Hicks,</HI> it is &s;o far Mar|ter of Hi&s;tory, and cannot be omitted, as what may al&s;o be of u&s;e on other Occa&s;ions.</P>

<P>Sealed on a Label with hard red Wax, the Seal repre&s;enting a Shepherd with a Sheep upon his Shoulders, and a Crook in his Hand, with this Mot|to, <HI>The good Shepherd.</HI></P>
<P>There were &s;everal other Papers taken at the &s;ame Time, and &s;everal other Things contained in the&s;e; as in particular, a Form or Office for Ab&s;olution of a Penitent, as they call'd them, or one returning <HI>from the Sci&s;m,</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>from</HI> the Church of <HI>England</HI> E&s;tabli&s;ht, <HI>to</HI> the Jacobite Church; which Office they add to the Liturgy of the Church.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, the Government thought it ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to pro&s;ecute the&s;e Things with Se|verity, and accordingly Mr. <HI>Howell</HI> was Tried for his Part at the <HI>Old-Baily,</HI> where, after a tedious Hearing on all &s;ides, (indeed he did not in&s;i&s;t much on his not being the Author, neither did he decline the Principles of <HI>Jacobiti&s;m</HI> mention'd in his Book, tho' that was no Argument to his Conviction,) <HI>he was found Guilty,</HI> and his Sentence, which however, has not been yet fully executed, was as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="284">
To be twice Whipp'd, to pay 500 <HI>l.</HI> Fine to the King, to lie three Years in Pri&s;on without Bail, and to find two Sureties in 400 <HI>l.</HI> each, and him|&s;elf to be Bound in 1000 <HI>l.</HI> to be of the good Beha|viour during Life. The Sentence being pa&s;s'd, the Hangman was order'd to take his Gown off as he &s;tood at the Bar, <HI>which was done accordingly.</HI></P>
<P>Thus ended this Church Di&s;pute, for the Sen|tence again&s;t Mr. <HI>Howell</HI> was &s;uch as an&s;wered the End of &s;uch Sentences, <HI>viz.</HI> it deferred any one el&s;e from meddling with it any more; as for the Princer Mr. <HI>Redmayne,</HI> he was afterwards brought to his Tryal al&s;o, and was fined 500 <HI>l.</HI> five Years Impri|&s;onment, and they both continue clo&s;e Pri&s;oners to this Day.</P>
<P>During this Church Controver&s;ie, which we &s;hall find renew'd quickly in another, equally tending to Confu&s;ion and Di&s;traction in Things religious; I &s;ay, during this, the publick Ju&s;tice went on, pur|&s;uing the Remains of the Rebellion, in order, had it been po&s;&s;ible, to root out the very Seeds of Di&s;af|fection from among the People.</P>
<P>During this, I &s;ay, publick Ju&s;tice proceeded, and three Particulars pre&s;ented; the fir&s;t was, that a Vi&s;itation, by Commi&s;&s;ion was made of the Univer&s;ities in <HI>Scot|land,</HI> but particularly at <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> where, upon the Landing of the Pretender, &s;everal of the Clergy, Members of the Colleges there, had too unwarily di&s;cover'd their Principles, and appear'd in the In|tere&s;t; the&s;e were &s;everally called before the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners, and Witne&s;&s;es examin'd again&s;t tho&s;e that appear'd: Several of them, to prevent their be|ing expell'd, voluntarily demitted, and expelled them&s;elves, &s;ome were fled into <HI>Prince,</HI> and tho&s;e that did appear, having $$en examin'd, and what
<PB N="20" REF="285">
they alledg'd, being mark'd down, the Commi&s;|&s;ioners gave no Sentence at that Time, but ad|journ'd to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> where meeting afterwards, the Per&s;ons were all expell'd the College.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Head of Ju&s;tice, in the&s;e Ca&s;es, relates to the Commi&s;&s;ioners appointed by Parliament, to enquire into the E&s;tates of the Delinquents: The&s;e having &s;eparated them&s;elves, part for <HI>Scotland,</HI> and part for <HI>England,</HI> according to the Act of Parlia|ment, began about this Time to put the Law in Execution, and &s;everal E&s;tates were enter'd upon, as well in <HI>England</HI> as in <HI>Scotland;</HI> as al&s;o &s;everal Parcels of Plate, of Jewels, and of Lands, &s;aid to be given to &s;uper&s;titious U&s;es; the Particular of all which, and of their farther Proceedings, will be &s;een together, when they come to make their Re|port to the Parliament, from whom they receiv'd their Power.</P>
<P>But I come back to the Proceedings at <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> which were the mo&s;t con&s;iderable, and on which the Eyes of all the World were turn'd at that Time, a Summary of which take as follows, <HI>viz.</HI> The Judges being arriv'd, as I ob&s;erv'd, the 1&s;t of <HI>De|cember,</HI> and all Things made ready for con&s;tituting a Court of Ju&s;tice, they met on the 7th, and having read their Commi&s;&s;ion, the Grand Jury were called, and the Judges gave them the Sum of the Bu&s;ine&s;s they were to do, in the Form of a Charge as u&s;ual; after which, Bills of Indictment were pre|&s;ented to them again&s;t the &s;everal Pri&s;oners re&s;pe|ctively, who, when the Grand Jury had found the &s;aid Bills, were brought to the Bar, and the Clerk of the Crown read a Form to them, &s;ignifying that Bills were found again&s;t them for High-Trea&s;on, in Levying War, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> That the Law allow'd Coun|cil to plead for them, and a Copy of their In|dictment
<PB N="21" REF="286">
to be given them; and five Days Notice of their Tryals if they de&s;ired it, and thereupon another Clerk delivered them Copies of their &s;eve|ral Indictments accordingly, and they de&s;iring the Time mention'd, the Court allow'd them &s;even Days, <HI>(viz.)</HI> to the <HI>15th,</HI> and gave them Notice of Tryal accordingly.</P>

<P><HI>Alexander Carnegie</HI> was indicted by the Name of <HI>James,</HI> and had &s;ome Advantage by it; but as it might in the main be &s;ome Ob&s;truction to the Mercy he re&s;olv'd to hope for, he gave notice of it him&s;elf, and the Bill was given back to the Grand-Jury, and found a &s;econd Time.</P>
<P>On the <HI>10th,</HI> when the &s;econd Twelve were brought to the Bar, Mr. <HI>Charles Garden,</HI> one of the fir&s;t Twelve, broke the Way, and moving the Court that he might be brought to the Bar and Ar|rain'd, pleaded Guilty, and threw him&s;elf upon Mercy.</P>

<P>On the <HI>20th, Pat. Gordon, Pat. Robert&s;on.</HI></P>

<P>The two <HI>Stewarts</HI> gave &s;uch Accounts of them|&s;elves, and the Court receiv'd &s;uch Satisfaction in that Account, that the Sollicitor-General thought fit to acquaint the Court that it would be for his Maje&s;ty's Service, to allow a Writ of <HI>N$li Pro&s;e|qui</HI> to be enter'd in their behalf, which was ordered accordingly, yet without mentioning any thing in publick of the Rea&s;ons which procur'd them &s;o much Favour.</P>

his Council in&s;i&s;ted, that he was not there in the Sen&s;e of the Indictment; that he was there indeed as a Pri&s;oner, or as a Man not in his own Power; but that he was not <HI>&s;ui juris,</HI> but was taken by Force by the Troops of the Marquis of <HI>Huntley,</HI> and carried along with them again&s;t his Will, which the Council alledged was not Rebellion with|in the Words of the Indictment; that the Adverbs of the Indictment would not hold, for that it was not <HI>Trayterou&s;ly, Seditiou&s;ly,</HI> and <HI>Advi&s;edly;</HI> but Unwillingly, Compul&s;ively, and Forcibly; again&s;t his Intention, Re&s;olution, and De&s;ign; the Witne&s;|&s;es which he produced, proved that he was thus forcibly taken, and brought away from his own Hou&s;e; that he entreated them not to carry him a|way, being ancient and infirm, I unfit for the Ser|vice or for the Hard&s;hip of the Field; that he pro|te&s;t$$ again&s;t the Violence they u&s;ed with him, and that he had declared, he would not &s;erve them any otherwi&s;e than by For$$</P>

<P>There was no Po&s;&s;ibility of his making any De|fence again&s;t all the&s;e Circum&s;tances of Guilt, yet, whether it was that he expected no Mercy, or that he re&s;olv'd to &s;eek not we know not, he pleaded not Guilty: But when the Time for his Trial was come, and the Officers were &s;ent to his Chamber to fetch him to the Bar, they found no|thing in his Room but his Hat and Perriwig, for he had, it &s;eems, found Means to e&s;cape out of the Ca&s;tle, and has not been &s;ince heard of.</P>
<P>Things &s;tanding thus, and the Court being in|form'd of it, and that there were no more Procee|dings before them, the Petty-Jury were di&s;charg'd, as the Grand-Jury had been &s;ome Days before, and then they proceeded to pa&s;s Sentence.</P>
<P>Accordingly the Pri&s;oners who had pleaded Guil|ty, were call'd up the &s;ame Day, and Sentence was pa&s;s'd upon them as is u&s;ual in Ca&s;es of Trea&s;on.</P>

<P>All Proceedings being thus at an End, the Com|mi&s;&s;ion was al&s;o clo&s;ed by the Judges, and the Court was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and three Days after the Judges came away, leaving however, no Order for the Executi|on of any of the Per&s;ons Condemn'd, mo&s;t of them being re&s;erv'd to his Maje&s;ty's Mercy; &s;o that it now appeared it was no ill Turn for them, that they were brought to <HI>England</HI> to be try'd.</P>
<P>At this Period I think I may put an End to all Things relating to the Rebellion, there being no more Executions on one hand, or Oppo&s;ition on the other after this, except a Serjeant who was Try'd by a Council of War at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> for the mi&s;car|ry'd Attempt of betraying the Ca&s;tle, he was found Guilty, and accordingly hang'd over the Ca&s;tle Wall at a prodigious Height from the Ground, where
<PB N="28" REF="293">
he was left hanging al&s;o for &s;ome Days, till a Storm of Wind happening to break the Rope, he fell down the Precipice, and was &s;o broken with the Fall, that they could not hang him up again.</P>
<P>As the re&s;t of the Pri&s;oners at <HI>Carli&s;le</HI> again&s;t whom no Evidence appe$$'d, were di&s;charg'd, &s;o Twenty-three more, mo&s;t of them <HI>Scots,</HI> were on the &s;ame Foot di&s;charg'd out of the Pri&s;ons at <HI>Lon|don,</HI> &s;o that now there remain'd only two Pri&s;oners in <HI>Newgate</HI> on that Account, and none at all in the <HI>Mar&s;hal&s;ea.</HI></P>
<P>The hurry of Bu&s;ine&s;s being thus over for a while, and the&s;e Things being tran&s;acted at a great Di&s;tance from Court, the Regent took a Tour into the Coun|try; the Occa&s;ion of this &s;hort Progre&s;s was no o|ther as I could ever learn, but a meer Turn for Di|ver&s;ion, and to take a little Air, and the &s;hort Stay the Prince made, confirms that Opinion, for he went out on the <HI>24th</HI> of <HI>September,</HI> din'd at <HI>Knowl</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Dor&s;et</HI>'s Seat, and lay that Night at the Duke of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI>'s Hou&s;e, near <HI>Lewes</HI> in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex:</HI> His Royal Highne&s;s diverted him|&s;elf as he went, by making a &s;hort Stay at <HI>Tun|bridge,</HI> to &s;ee the Wells and the Walks, and diver|ted the People there al&s;o very much: The next Day he went thro' <HI>Chiche&s;ter</HI> to <HI>Stan&s;ted,</HI> the Seat of the Earl of <HI>Scarborough,</HI> where he lay that Night: The <HI>26th</HI> he went to &s;ee the Fortifications at <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> and returned the &s;ame Night to <HI>Stan&s;ted;</HI> and the <HI>27th,</HI> returned to <HI>$Word$ Court.</HI></P>
<P>All Things were may in a State of Tranquillity, and &s;eem'd to promi&s;e a Continuance, but an un|fore&s;een Accident gave &s;ome Di&s;turbance to it, and this was the Tumult at <HI>Oxford,</HI> an Affair which made great Noi&s;e at fir&s;t, and was afterwards brought before, both the Council and the Parliament, where
<PB N="29" REF="294">
tho' the <HI>Oxonians</HI> receiv'd &s;ome Checks, yet no Ju|dicial Proceedings were ever had again&s;t the Town&s;|men or Scholars, as was threaten'd, the Soldiers ha|ving too much to be called in que&s;tion for, to de&s;ire the Cau&s;e to be heard any where but where it was.</P>
<P>The Bu&s;ine&s;s was, in &s;hort, that the <HI>30th</HI> of <HI>Octo|ber</HI> being the Prince's Birth Day, and a Regiment of Soldiers, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the Regiment of Foot of <HI>Dubour|gay</HI> being quarter'd in the Town, the Major of the Regiment re&s;olving to celebrate the Day, and find|ing the Inhabitants inclined to take but little Notice of it, &s;ome Bickerings happen'd between the Major and the Town&s;men, about Ringing the Bells and &s;uch Things, afterwards they fell to throwing Stones on both Sides, breaking of Windows, and &s;ome Heads in the Quarrel, and it was &s;aid, the Mayor and Aldermen received &s;ome of the Knocks.</P>
<P>However it was the Magi&s;trates made the fir&s;t Complaint, and drew up a great many Affidavits of the Fact, and Mr. <HI>Rowney</HI> their Repre&s;entative, wrote a Letter to Mr. Secretary <HI>Methuen</HI> about it, as did al&s;o the Vice-Chancellor of the Univer&s;ity and the Mayor of the City, to my Lord <HI>Town&s;hend:</HI> On the other hand, Major <HI>Offranville,</HI> the Major of the Regiment wrote likewi&s;e to the Lord <HI>Town&s;hend,</HI> and the Soldiers drew up Affidavits al&s;o to every Particular; at length it came to be heard before the Council, who after &s;ome Debates, Re&s;olved it in Favour of the Soldiers, which Re&s;olve being after|wards heard in the Hou&s;e of Lords, was confirm'd there Word for Word, as I &s;hall note in its Place: The Report of the Committee of Council was as follows, <HI>(viz.)</HI></P>

<Q><P><HI>THE Depo&s;itions on the Part of the Complainants relating to the Di&s;turbances that happened at</HI> Oxford <HI>on the Prince's Birth-Day, and the Depo&s;i|tions on the Part of the Officers and Soldiers, and others concerned with them, having all been read, the Lords of the Committee are of Opinion, That the Heads of the &V;niver&s;ity, and Mayor of the City, neglected to make any publick Rejoicings on the Prince's Birth-Day: But &s;ome of the Collegiates, with the Officers, being met to celebrate the &s;aid Day, the Hou&s;e where they were, was a&s;&s;aulted, and the Win|dows were broken by the Rabble, which was the Be|ginning and Occa&s;ion of the Riots that en&s;ued, as well from the Soldiers as the Scholars and Town&s;men, and that the Conduct of the Major &s;eems well ju&s;tified by the Affidavits produced on his Part.</HI></P></Q>
<P>When the&s;e Things came to be heard before the Hou&s;e of Lords, their Lord&s;hips came to the like Re&s;olution, <HI>(viz.)</HI> Fir&s;t they voted, <HI>That the Lords of the Committee of Council had &s;ufficient Grounds to come to the Re&s;olution they did come to,</HI> as above; and then they took into Con&s;ideration the Printing the Depo&s;itions, upon which they Re&s;olv'd &s;econdly, <HI>That the Printing and Publi&s;hing the Depo&s;itions upon which the Complaints relating to the Riots at</HI> Oxford <HI>were founded, while that Matter was under the Exa|mination of the Lords of the Committee of Council, and before they had Time to come to any Re&s;oluti|on touching the &s;ame, was Irregular, Di&s;re&s;pectful to his Royal Highne&s;s the Prince, and tending to Sedition.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="296">
Tumults indeed took up a great Part of the fir&s;t Month of this Year, for there was &s;omething &s;o unea&s;y and di&s;&s;atisfy'd in the People's Temper at that Time, that they made almo&s;t every thing an Occa&s;ion of Riot and Di&s;order: The Occa&s;ion how|ever of this I am going to relate, did not begin up|on any Matters of State or Politicks, which verifies what I have ju&s;t now &s;aid of the tumultuous Di&s;po|&s;ition of the People.</P>
<P>There is a Fair for Cattle held at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> the <HI>12th</HI> of <HI>November,</HI> call'd <HI>Hallow-Fair,</HI> or in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> the Fair of <HI>Alhallows,</HI> or of <HI>All-Saints,</HI> a Soldier in this Fair, having &s;ome Dirt thrown upon him by a Cow running ha&s;tily by him, draws his Sword up|on a <HI>Scots</HI> Highlander who was driving the Cow, and wounded the poor Fellow in the Arm; upon this other Highlanders came in, and &s;eeing the poor Man hurt, fell upon the Soldier; the Soldier de|fended him&s;elf a while, but &s;eeing his Danger, made off, the Rabble following him to the General's Quar|ters, where there was a Guard, and where the Mob demanded him, and one of them pre&s;&s;ing in violently upon the Centinel, he fir'd and kill'd him; but this encrea&s;ing the Tumult, the Rabble had cer|tainly &s;torm'd the General's Hou&s;e and perhaps done more Mi&s;chief, if General <HI>Carpenter</HI> had not come timely in with a &s;trong Party, and even then the Mob would not have been pacify'd, if the General by his very obliging and civil Treatment had not prevail'd more, than his Men did or could have done by their Fire-Arms and Swords.</P>
<P>The <HI>9th</HI> of this Month, the Prince&s;s was delive|red of a dead Child, and was not only very ill in her Travail, but in great Danger for two or three Days, after having been taken with Faintings and
<PB N="32" REF="297">
Swoonings two or three Times, but it went off a|gain, and in a Week &s;he was out of Danger.</P>
<P>The Sea&s;on advancing, and Winter coming on, the King, who had been now above four Months abroad, began to look homeward; and as his Affairs &s;eem'd to draw to a clo&s;e, the Squadron appointed to Convoy him over, with the Yatchts for his Re|tinue, were order'd over to <HI>Holland,</HI> and the Par|liament which &s;tood prorogu'd to the <HI>20th,</HI> now were order'd to be farther prorogu'd to the <HI>8th</HI> of <HI>January,</HI> by which Time it was expected the King would have fini&s;hed all his Bu&s;ine&s;s and be arriv'd.</P>
<P>This mentioning his Maje&s;ty's Affairs Abroad, car|ries me naturally to enquire into the Particulars of them as far as they are proper to this Hi&s;tory, and fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ing over his Maje&s;ty's Hou&s;hold Bu&s;ine&s;s A|broad, or as it Relates to the Government of his Hereditary Dominions; I &s;ay, pa&s;&s;ing the&s;e, the Affairs the King had there which Re&s;pected <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Great-Britain</HI> were principally two: (viz.) <HI>1&s;t</HI> Con|cerning him&s;elf in the Affair of <HI>Sweden;</HI> to which purpo&s;e a Squadron had been &s;ent to the <HI>Baltick,</HI> which now receiv'd it's Orders immediately from the King in Per&s;on; and <HI>2dly,</HI> Negotiating a defen&s;ive Alliance with <HI>France,</HI> of which it is needfull to make &s;ome mention, becau&s;e an Alliance with <HI>France</HI> was really a new Thing in the World, and People began to wonder what the meaning of it might be, expecting that by the Novelty of it &s;ome thing particular was intended, it is true that the Circum&s;tances were very particular on both &s;ides, and it is not ea&s;y to &s;ay by whom it was mo&s;t wanted or mo&s;t de&s;ired, either <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> or <HI>France:</HI> It is confe&s;s'd <HI>France</HI> &s;ought it, perhaps their Nece&s;&s;ity at that time prompted them; but it is as true that the Councils of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> came very willingly into it, and
<PB N="33" REF="298">
that on the account of Intere&s;t al&s;o, as well as <HI>France,</HI> this is not ill &s;tated by one, who a cer|tain Writer need not be a&s;ham'd to own he took it from, and who I follow in this Ca&s;e, tho' with more Hone&s;ty, becau&s;e I acknowledge it: He ex|pre&s;&s;es it thus: The Duke Regent, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> a Man of Prudence and Penetration, &s;aw not only his own Safety ab&s;olutely depending upon it, in Ca&s;e of the Demi&s;e of the pre&s;ent King; but happily for him, found his Neighbours had &s;ome certain nice Articles, which it was in his <HI>Power</HI> to yield them at that time, and which would infallibly render the Propo|&s;al acceptable to them. For example, he could not but know, that the <HI>Pretender</HI> and his Friends, who were all in his Power, would be a Sacrifice highly agreeable to the King of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and nece&s;&s;a|ry to the Peace of his Subjects; that the Affair of <HI>Mardyke</HI> would be a Pledge of too great a Value not to be earne&s;tly de&s;ired by <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and would be a &s;ingular Ea&s;e to the Merchants of &s;uch a Trading Country; he knew that when he offered two &s;uch Points, the Court of <HI>Britain</HI> were too penetrating not to li&s;ten to it, and if po&s;&s;ible &s;ecure them upon any rea&s;onable Terms.</P>
<P>He knew the <HI>Dutch,</HI> a Nation de&s;irous of Peace upon ju&s;t Terms, and depending wholly upon Trade, would be very glad of a Conce&s;&s;ion which <HI>France</HI> had in its Power to give, <HI>viz.</HI> the Tariff of <HI>Sixty Four;</HI> and finding it of the la&s;t Importance to him|&s;elf to &s;ecure the Amity of the&s;e two powerful Neighbours, he re&s;olved to deny nothing they could rea&s;onably demand, in order to enter into new Engagements with them both; that if at any time he &s;hould come to have his Claim to the Crown of <HI>France</HI> di&s;puted by the Hou&s;e of <HI>Spain,</HI> he might not
<PB N="34" REF="299">
only be &s;ecure behind him, but al&s;o be powerfully Supported.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e Con&s;iderations, he made no &s;cruple to agree to expunge the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and all his Ad|herents, entirely out of the Dominions of <HI>France;</HI> nay, even to oblige him to remove from <HI>Avignon,</HI> tho' it was a Place entirely in the Juri&s;diction, and under the Sovereignty of the Pope. He made no &s;cruple of Engaging to give no Sanctuary in the Dominions of <HI>France,</HI> to any of King <HI>George</HI>'s Re|bels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and he made no difficulty effectually to demoli&s;h and de&s;troy the new Canal of <HI>Mardyke,</HI> and all the Works there or at <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> which &s;hould be capable of making either of tho&s;e Places Defen|&s;ible, or fit for receiving Ships of Burthen. Be&s;ides this, he made no difficulty of granting to the <HI>Dutch</HI> all they had to de&s;ire in their Commerce, and to give them a free Trade into <HI>France</HI> upon &s;uch Terms as they had formerly enjoy'd.</P>
<P>The&s;e Conce&s;&s;ions made the Propo&s;als of <HI>France</HI> reli&s;h very well both at <HI>London,</HI> and at the <HI>Hague;</HI> and it appears &s;ince, that the King took his Mea|&s;ures very right in accepting the Project of the Trea|ty of Alliance, &s;ince he &s;aw the Regent under per|haps a greater Nece&s;&s;ity of it, than even if he had been reduced by a War, and that now was the Time, not only to obtain of the <HI>French</HI> all that could be asked, but even to bring the <HI>French</HI> Court to be dependent upon the <HI>Briti&s;h,</HI> and always at|tach'd to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t, by the undi&s;&s;embling Tie, of a regard to their own.</P>
<P>The&s;e were &s;ome of the Motives to this Alliance on both &s;ides; in which it was to be ob&s;erv'd, the <HI>French</HI> proceeded with more Candour and Openne&s;s than u&s;ually was the Practice of that wily Nation.
<PB N="35" REF="300">
His <HI>Britannick</HI> Maje&s;ty, though he found the Inte|re&s;t of his Kingdoms very vi&s;ibly form'd in the Treaty, yet wi&s;ely &s;uffered him&s;elf to be a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly Courted to it, and gave the <HI>French</HI> Occa&s;ion to let the World know, it was their Motion, and at their De&s;ire; which re&s;erve in the Conduct of the Trea|ty, gave his Maje&s;ty opportunity in many Ca&s;es to in&s;i&s;t with Advantage on &s;everal Things, which per|haps the <HI>French</HI> would otherwi&s;e with more difficul|ty have given up, as the Manner and Circum&s;tances of the Demoli&s;hing <HI>Mardyke,</HI> the Dimen&s;ions to which the Sluices were to be reduced, the &s;ending o|ver <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners to in&s;pect the Performance, and the like; al&s;o, as to the Entertaining of Fugi|tives, the removing of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and his De|pendents, and &s;uch other Ca&s;es as were the mo&s;t E&s;|&s;ential on the King's &s;ide.</P>
<P>Al&s;o, this di&s;tingui&s;h'd Conduct on his Maje&s;ty's Side, put a Stop to all &s;eeming Di&s;&s;atisfactions that might affect the People on occa&s;ion of this Treaty. An Alliance with <HI>France</HI> was a new thing to be talk'd of in the&s;e Kingdoms; it had &s;o often been entered upon in a &s;candalous Manner, and with an ill De|&s;ign, that it was &s;omething difficult to reconcile the People &s;o much as to the very thing in general; but when it was an&s;wered, that the King, who it was &s;uppos'd, always acted in &s;uch Ca&s;es with his Eyes open, and was not to be impo&s;ed upon by the Arts of the <HI>French</HI> Court, or to be deceived by their u|&s;ual Cunning; I &s;ay, when the Nation came to con|&s;ider, that the King him&s;elf was at the Head of the Treaty, and that he was upon the Spor, all that Jealou&s;ie, which began to infu&s;e its &s;elf into the Minds of the People in general, vani&s;hed of a &s;udden, and they entirely depended upon it, that if the King engag'd in &s;uch a Treaty, he would
<PB N="36" REF="301">
bring it to an&s;wer the De&s;ires and Intere&s;ts of his People, or not conclude it at all.</P>
<P>Nor has the Event deceiv'd their Expectation, every Article of the Treaty which relates to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> being vi&s;ibly calculated for her Intere&s;t and Advantage.</P>
<P>Thus the Treaty went on with Succe&s;s, it was ma|nag'd at the <HI>Hague</HI> by the Marquis <HI>Chateauneuf,</HI> and the Abbor <HI>Du Bois</HI> on the <HI>French</HI> Part; by the Lord <HI>Cadogan,</HI> and the ordinary <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Re&s;ident on his Ma|je&s;ty's Part, the King him&s;elf being at Hand to give In&s;tructions on any Emergency, <HI>viz.</HI> at <HI>Hanover;</HI> and by the Pen&s;ionary <HI>Hyen&s;ius</HI> chiefly, on the Part of the <HI>States,</HI> and about the middle of <HI>January</HI> was concluded and fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>There was be&s;ides the&s;e Things of Weight, one Bu&s;ine&s;s of le&s;&s;er Importance which was requi&s;ite to be manag'd at <HI>Hanover</HI> only, this was the ve&s;ting the young Prince Royal, the King's Grand&s;on, with the Order of the Garter, as al&s;o his Maje&s;ty's Bro|ther Prince <HI>Erne&s;t,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>O&s;naburgh,</HI> and Duke of <HI>York,</HI> which was done with all the u&s;ual Cere|monies, the King him&s;elf putting on the blew Rib|band on his Brother, as al&s;o on the young Prince, in his own Clo&s;et; as to their In&s;tallment, it was not till many Months after, as &s;hall be mention'd in its Place.</P>
<P>I omit &s;malier Matters here, which might perhaps take up &s;ome few Days between the Preparations for the King's coming over and his arriving; the main and more con&s;iderable Things which happen'd at this Time, drawing me off from Things of le&s;&s;er Moment.</P>
<P>Breaches and Contention between the Parties were no Novelty, and Hi&s;tory would be even clogg'd in the Repetition of them; but that the Whigs
<PB N="37" REF="302">
&s;hould fall out among them&s;elves, and that when the Game was all in their own Hands too, when they had their Enemies all under their Feet, when nothing could oppo&s;e or with&s;tand them, this is what no Hi&s;tory can equal, no Hi&s;torian could expect, and can hardly be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;pring from any Founda|tion but this, that &s;omething mu&s;t be in hand to do, which the <HI>Re&s;igners,</HI> for &s;o they were call'd, cared not to have any hand in, or &s;omething propo&s;ed to them to be done, which they cared not to comply with.</P>
<P>Two Things indeed were in Agitation at that Time, which, it was expected by many, would have been brought into Parliament in the en&s;uing Se&s;&s;ion, and which &s;ome have &s;aid were entirely broken off and defeated by the demitting of tho&s;e Men, with|out who&s;e Intere&s;t, the Per&s;ons concern'd did not think them&s;elves &s;ufficient for the Undertaking: The&s;e two Things were as follows, <HI>(viz.)</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. The taking off the Acts of Parliament which &s;everally di&s;abled the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England</HI> from enjoying any Employment or Office of Tru&s;t in the Government, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And,</P>
<P N="2">II. The repealing that Part of the Act for Secu|rity of the Succe&s;&s;ion, made in the <HI>Sixth</HI> of Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> Prohibiting Foreigners, tho' Na|turalized, to be capable of Sitting in the Hou&s;e of Lords.</P>
<P>The la&s;t of the&s;e &s;eem'd to re&s;pect the enobling &s;ome Foreigners, who, it &s;eems, had their Eyes, or their Friends for them, upon the Project of introducing them into the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Peetage, and a Pamphlet was written by one <HI>Toland,</HI> a Pro|fligate of the Party, to prepare the Minds of the People, and perhaps of the Parliament for &s;uch a Thing; but this Pamphlet rather alarm'd the Peers,
<PB N="38" REF="303">
than influenc'd them in Favour of the De&s;ign, and the Thing was &s;o expo&s;ed and ridicul'd by other Pamphiets, that the Contrivers were ea&s;ily convinc'd of the Impracticablene&s;s of the Thing, and laid down the De&s;ign.</P>
<P>As for the Sentiments of the great Men at Court, they were no le&s;s divided upon this Article than up|on others, and as one Divi&s;ion generally introduces another, a &s;trange Di&s;tru&s;t, Unea&s;ine&s;s, and at la&s;t Di&s;&s;ati faction &s;eem'd to &s;pread it&s;elf among even the Mini&s;try it &s;elf, &s;o that the Cla&s;hings at length appear'd to be ob&s;tructing to the publick Bu&s;ine&s;s, and the King was in a few Words, obliged to take it into his own Hands.</P>
<P>Here began the Changes which follow'd, and as his Maje&s;ty found it convenient to change &s;ome Hands in the Admini&s;tration, &s;o &s;ome others believing they &s;hould not have the &s;ame Freedom in acting, which they had before, tho' nece&s;&s;ary to the Ser|vice, cho&s;e rather to demit, than &s;erve with tho&s;e who they had no Confidence in, and perhaps expe|cted no A&s;&s;i&s;tance from.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t who was remov'd, was the Lord Vi&s;count <HI>Town&s;hend,</HI> Secretary of State; the King being yet at <HI>H$nover,</HI> &s;ent his Lord&s;hip's Di&s;mi&s;s from thence on the <HI>12th</HI> of <HI>December.</HI></P>
<P>The Whiggs were Thunder-&s;truck at this Blow, and receiv'd the News with the greate&s;t A&s;toni&s;h|ment and Co$$$ernation: But tho' the Lord <HI>Town|&s;hend</HI> was di&s;mi&s;s'd from the Office of Secretary, yet he &s;eem'd for &s;ome time to keep his Intere&s;t in his Prince's Favour, &s;eeing it was immediately re|&s;olv'd to make him Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> in the Room of the Duke of <HI>Grafton,</HI> and Lord <HI>Gall|way,</HI> who were about that time di&s;mi&s;s'd; and tho' this was not immediately done, and we were told
<PB N="39" REF="304">
for a while, that his Lord&s;hip declin'd that Po&s;t, yet &s;oon after the King's Arrival it was fix'd, and my Lord <HI>Town&s;hend</HI> was accordingly appointed Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and entred upon the &s;aid Office, tho' that good Di&s;po&s;ition of Things did not continue neither but for a little while, as we &s;hall &s;ee pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>In the mean time, this Remove was not attended for the pre&s;ent with any others as Con&s;equences of it. There were indeed &s;ome other Changes in Court Offices, <HI>which it is meet to mention here.</HI> But the great Change which was made on Party-Account was not yet for &s;ome time, and is therefore referr'd to its proper Place. The immediate Changes were the&s;e, <HI>(viz.)</HI></P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Roxburgh</HI> was appointed Secretary of State, not, <HI>properly &s;peaking,</HI> in the Room of the Lord <HI>Town&s;hend,</HI> but rather in the Vacancy which had remain'd ever &s;ince the Duke of <HI>Mon|tre&s;s</HI> laid down, as is mention'd in our la&s;t Year.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Sunderland,</HI> Lord Privy-Seal, demit|ted that Employment, and was made Vice Trea&s;urer of <HI>Ireland</HI> for Life; an Employ of great Advantage; but as it was officiated by Officers under his Lord|&s;hip, we &s;hall &s;oon find him filling up a higher Sta|tion on this &s;ide the Seas.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Montro&s;s</HI> was made Lord Privy-Seal in <HI>Scotland,</HI> in the Room of the Duke of <HI>Roxburgh;</HI> and the Duke of <HI>King&s;ton,</HI> Lord Privy-Seal in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> in the room of the Earl of <HI>Sunderland.</HI></P>
<P>The Lord <HI>Polwarth,</HI> elde&s;t Son to the Earl of <HI>Marchmont,</HI> and Amba&s;&s;ador at the Court of <HI>Den|mark,</HI> was made Lord Clerk Regi&s;ter in <HI>Scotland,</HI> formerly po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by the Earl of <HI>Gla&s;gow.</HI></P>
<P>In this Di&s;po&s;ition things remained till the King's Return; the Lord <HI>Town&s;hend</HI>'s Remove affected no
<PB N="40" REF="305">
more for the pre&s;ent than him&s;elf; and tho' there were many Divi&s;ions talked of, which al&s;o &s;eemed irreconcileable; yet the King's Judgment and Au|thority reconciled them all again, till they broke out anew upon another Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the King prepar'd to come home, the Queen of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> his Maje&s;ty's Daugh|ter, who came on purpo&s;e to make a Vi&s;it to her Father, had taken her Leave; the Treaty with <HI>France</HI> was fini&s;hed, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> came into it, by which either Party were Guarantees to each other for the pre&s;ent State of Affairs, and Stipulations made for the Quota's of Troops to be &s;upply'd to each in Ca&s;e of being attack?d thus, <HI>France</HI> and the <HI>States-General</HI> were Guarantees to the King of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> for the Succe&s;&s;ion; <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and <HI>France</HI> Guarantees to the <HI>States-General</HI> for the Barrier Treaty; and <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and the <HI>States-General</HI> Guarantees to <HI>France</HI> for the Renunciations, all which are, it is &s;aid, included in the Treaty.</P>
<P>The next Thing the King had to do, was an Inter|view with the Czar of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> which it was ex|pected &s;hould have been in <HI>Holland;</HI> but the Czar was indi&s;pos'd, and the King's in&s;i&s;ting upon the Czar's removing his Troops out of <HI>Mecklemburgh,</HI> gave that Prince &s;ome Di&s;ta&s;te, which at pre&s;ent made People expect a Breach, but the Wi&s;dom of both Sides prevented the ill Con&s;equences; the good Under&s;tanding &s;eem'd afterwards to be E&s;ta|bli&s;h'd, and the Czar did (tho' not without Regret) withdraw his Troops, whether there is not &s;ome &s;e|cret Di&s;ta&s;te remaining upon that Score, Time may perhaps di&s;cover.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things being all over, the King having fini&s;hed all the Foreign Bu&s;ine&s;s which lay before him, &s;et out from <HI>Hanover</HI> on <HI>Tue&s;day the 19th,</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="306">
New-&s;tile, and arriv'd at <HI>O&s;naburgh</HI> that Night, where his Royal Highne&s;s the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> his Maje&s;ty's Brother, and Bi&s;hop of <HI>O&s;naburgh,</HI> was gone before to Entertain him, the <HI>21&s;t,</HI> his Maje&s;ty came to <HI>Loo,</HI> where he was met and complimented by the Prince&s;s Dowager of <HI>Na&s;&s;au-Frie&s;land,</HI> and her Children; the <HI>23d,</HI> his Maje&s;ty came to <HI>Utrecht</HI> in the Afternoon, and making but a very &s;hort &s;tay there, lay that Night at <HI>Vlaerden,</HI> having been at|tended to <HI>Utrecht</HI> by the Earl of <HI>Sunderland,</HI> the Lord <HI>Cadogan,</HI> and Mr. Secretary <HI>Stanhope.</HI></P>
<P>On <HI>Monday</HI> the <HI>14th</HI> of <HI>January, O. S.</HI> His Ma|je&s;ty &s;et out from <HI>Vlaerden</HI> at Four in the Afternoon, and lay that Night on Board the <HI>States</HI> Yatcht in the <HI>Mae&s;e.</HI> On the <HI>15th,</HI> his Maje&s;ty pa&s;s'd through the <HI>Old Mae&s;e,</HI> and at Three in the Afternoon landed at <HI>Helvoet-Sluys,</HI> and lay there that Night. On the <HI>16th,</HI> his Maje&s;ty Embark'd, and lay that Night on Board the <HI>Carolina</HI> Yatcht. On the <HI>17th,</HI> about Two in the Afternoon, the Squadron, commanded by Admiral <HI>Aylmer,</HI> with the Yatchts, &s;ailed out of the <HI>Goree:</HI> The next Day, about three in the Af|ternoon, his Maje&s;ty landed at <HI>Margate,</HI> and lay that Night at <HI>Canterbury.</HI> On <HI>Saturday</HI> the <HI>19th,</HI> about Six in the Morning, he came by Coach from <HI>Canterbury:</HI> Between three and four in the After|noon, he was met on <HI>Black-Heath</HI> by the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> with a great Number of the Nobility and Gentry, and other Per&s;ons of Di&s;tinction. And ha|ving, with great Affection, Embrac'd his Royal Highne&s;s in his Arms, took him in his Coach, and they came from thence together; then pa&s;&s;ing thro' the City, they arriv'd at St. <HI>James</HI>'s about Six in the Evening; the People all the Way ma|king Acclamations for his happy Return:
<PB N="42" REF="307">
In the Evening there were Bonfires, Illuminati|ons, and all other Demon&s;trations of Joy.</P>
<P>The King being return'd, all Eyes were turn'd to|wards the Court, and it was &s;urpri&s;ing to find, that no farther Changes were made; the Breach at Court &s;eem'd to be heal'd, and the King appear'd plea&s;ed with every Body, every Body &s;eem'd pleas'd with one another; the Lord <HI>Town&s;hend</HI> appear'd at Court on one hand, and the King &s;hew'd him &s;everal Marks of particular Re&s;pect, and his Lord&s;hip on the other hand accepted to be Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and was publickly declar'd to be &s;o in Council, which he had for &s;ome time before declin'd; &s;o that now all Things &s;eem'd reconcil'd again at Court, nor were there any more Removes &s;o much as talk'd of, except, that Mr. <HI>John $orte&s;cue-Aland,</HI> an eminent Council at Law was made one of the Barons of the Exchequer; and Sir <HI>William Thomp&s;on,</HI> Recorder of <HI>London,</HI> was made Sollicitor-General.</P>
<P>But this Harmony continu'd but a little while, and the &s;econd Rupture which follow'd, was &s;o much wor&s;e than the fir&s;t, by how much it &s;eem'd impo&s;&s;ible ever to be made up, and has continu'd &s;o indeed ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>The King being arriv'd, the &s;itting of the Parlia|ment was expected, and that with &s;ome Impatience, becau&s;e it was in this approaching Se&s;&s;ion, that the great Attempt was to be made to reduce the Intere&s;t of the Funds, and le&s;&s;en thereby, and at la&s;t pay off the Nation's Debts; the Propo&s;als for this had been made Publick, and they came handed into the World with &s;uch &s;eeming Authority, that it was not doubted, but they were the Re&s;ult of tho&s;e Schemes which were really laid for the putting it in Executi|on, as indeed it afterwards appear'd to be, and the Divi&s;ions upon the&s;e Things without Doors, was &s;o
<PB N="43" REF="308">
great, that really the People wanted the Parliament to meet to put an End to them, for the Price of all publick Things was uncertain, none knew how or what to buy or &s;ell, or how to value his own E&s;tate.</P>
<P>But the meeting of the Parliament was yet far|ther delay'd, upon a new Incident from Abroad, this was the Rumour of a Plot forming in <HI>Sweden</HI> for invading the King's Dominions in Favour of the <HI>Pretender</HI> by the King of <HI>Sweden.</HI></P>
<P>This made &s;o much Noi&s;e for a while, that tho' by the Event there may have been &s;ome room to doubt, whether there was any &s;uch De&s;ign or no, or whether there were any &s;uch Preparations at <HI>Gottem|burgh</HI> as was pretended, yea or no, yet for a time the whole Kingdom was amu&s;ed with it, and per|&s;uaded to believe, and expect every Day an Army of Veteran <HI>Swedes,</HI> and a &s;trong Squadron of Men of War with them, to Land even in the Heart of the Kingdom, nay, &s;ome were &s;o forward as to tell us, they would even come up the River, and Land with|in a few Marches of the City of <HI>London,</HI> depending upon Thou&s;ands of People here to join them.</P>
<P>The Pretence was &s;pecious indeed, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be only a Pretence, which however I will not affirm, and the Nation exceedingly alarm'd at it for a while. It was about the End of <HI>January,</HI> as we were told, that the Government had &s;ecret Intelli|gence of a concerted De&s;ign to Foment a new Re|bellion, under the Protection of &s;ome Foreign Troops to be procur'd from Abroad, and that this De&s;ign was carry'd on between &s;ome Foreign Mini&s;ters Abroad, and &s;ome of the Pretender's Friends here at Home, and &s;uch Progre&s;s was made in the Di&s;covery, that on the <HI>29th,</HI> the King order'd an Account of it to be laid before the Privy-Council, that the farther Proceedings upon it might be carry'd on in a more
<PB N="44" REF="309">
formal Method, according to the ordinary Cour&s;e of Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The whole Relation of the farther Proceedings on this Affair having been publi&s;hed at the Time of them by &s;o many Hands, cannot be mi&s;taken, and are Word for Word with very little Omi&s;&s;ions for the Sake of Brevity, as follows, <HI>(viz.)</HI></P>
<P>On the <HI>30th</HI> very early, <HI>viz.</HI> about Two a Clock in the Morning, an Officer of the Guards with &s;ome Mu&s;queteers, were &s;ent to the Hou&s;e of Count <HI>Gyllenborg,</HI> the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Envoy, with Orders to &s;ecure the Avenues to the Hou&s;e, and were fol|lowed by Lieutenant General <HI>Wade,</HI> with Orders to Seize all his Papers, and to &s;et a Guard upon his Per&s;on, and &s;uffer none to &s;peak with him; but not to remove him out of his own Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The Count, &s;urprized with the Me&s;&s;age which was fir&s;t delivered at his Door by the Officer, refu&s;ed for &s;ome time to admit them, and Claiming the Pri|vilege of an Amba&s;&s;ador, pretended to Defend him|&s;elf; but being quickly made &s;en&s;ible, that if he attempted that, they &s;hould make very &s;hort work with him, that the Officer was not an&s;werable for any Mi&s;take in the Orders to &s;eize him; but that his Bu&s;ine&s;s was to execute tho&s;e Orders, which he was obliged to do, and would immediately perform; being, I &s;ay, made &s;en&s;ible of this, he found it convenient to &s;ubmit; but, as it was &s;aid, took Oc|ca&s;ion in tho&s;e few Minutes of Parley, to de&s;troy &s;uch Papers as he had near at Hand, and which he was con&s;cious he ought not to let be taken about him; and thus the Officer being let in, the Envoy was put under Arre&s;t in his own Hou&s;e, the Officer who was left to guard him, having Orders to &s;uffer no one to &s;peak with him, nor him to &s;peak with any one by Night or by Day, except in his hearing.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="310">
It will not be wonder'd at, that &s;uch an Affair as this made a great Noi&s;e, as is u&s;ual in &s;uch Ca&s;es: All the Foreign Mini&s;ters appeared the next Day at Court, to learn the Rea&s;ons of &s;uch a Proceeding, and to crave leave that the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ter might be allowed the Privilege of an Amba&s;&s;ador, accor|ding to the Law of Nations. They receiv'd for the pre&s;ent, an An&s;wer in general, that in a Day or two they &s;hould be fully acquainted with the Rea|&s;ons of &s;uch a Proceeding; and accordingly on the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of <HI>February,</HI> which was but two Days after, the following Letter was &s;ent by Mr. Secretary <HI>Stan|hope,</HI> and Mr. Secretary <HI>Methuen,</HI> to all the Foreign Mini&s;ters, to give them rea&s;onable Satisfaction in this Affair.</P>

<P>THE King having received reiterated Advices, and having inconte&s;table Proofs of &s;everal very dangerous Practices which have been managed and con|ducted, for &s;ome time by the Count <HI>de Gyllen|borg,</HI> Mini&s;ter of the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> here, and which plainly tended to foment, in his Maje|&s;ty's

<P>But Matters did not End here, for the Govern|ment had found Means to fix all the&s;e Negotiations upon a Per&s;on beyond the Seas; and tho' Count <HI>Gyllenborg</HI>'s Letters had not pointed it out to them, yet they knew very well who the Count's Principal Corre&s;pondent was, <HI>viz.</HI> The Baron <HI>Gortz,</HI> a Per|&s;on, who, tho' he was properly a Mini&s;ter of the
<PB N="50" REF="315">
Duke of <HI>Hol&s;tein's,</HI> yet at this time was appointed by the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> to negotiate his Affairs in divers Courts abroad, and in particular, in the Treaty at <HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> if it had gone for|ward.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides what private Information the Govern|ment had of this, the Letters &s;eiz'd among Count <HI>Gyllenborg</HI>'s Papers, confirming every thing, led them as it were by the Hand into the Particulars, &s;o that they now wanted no farther Light into that Part of the Con&s;piracy: It remained only to con|trive &s;ome Method how to get this warm Agent of the Party into their Hands, which they quickly found means to bring to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>The Baron had been at the Court of <HI>France,</HI> and was come from thence into <HI>Flanders,</HI> from whence he was expected back at the <HI>Hague</HI> the <HI>24th</HI> of <HI>January, N.S.</HI> and the Intelligence of this being well-grounded, Orders were di&s;patched to Mr. <HI>Leathes,</HI> the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Re&s;ident at the <HI>Hague,</HI> to apply him&s;elf with the greate&s;t Secre&s;ie po&s;&s;ible to the States General, to obtain leave to Arre&s;t and Secure the Baron <HI>Gortz</HI> in the Name of the King of <HI>England,</HI> which, as he was under no publick Cha|racter immediately to the &s;aid States, was a Favour they could not refu&s;e. The <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Re&s;ident di&s;|charg'd him&s;elf of the&s;e Orders &s;o well, that he obtained all that he de&s;ired, and executed the Au|thority he obtained in the following manner.</P>
<P>The Baron arriv'd at the <HI>Hague</HI> perfectly &s;ecure, and on the Day he was expected; it &s;eems, till then he was wholly ignorant of the Fate of Count <HI>Gyl|lenborg,</HI> and appeared to be in a great Surprize when he receiv'd an Account of it, and was in the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion when he was privately informed,
<PB N="51" REF="316">
that he was in &s;ome Danger of the &s;ame Fate him|&s;elf; for it &s;eems &s;ome &s;ecret Friend of his had gotten knowledge of it time enough to inform him of it, and he lo&s;t no time to provide for his own Safety; for he immediately &s;et out from the <HI>Hague</HI> in the private&s;t Manner he could in a Po&s;t Chai&s;e, accompanied only with the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> General <HI>Poni|atowski,</HI> and went directly for <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> judging rightly, that he had no Time to lo&s;e; and indeed had he u&s;ed the &s;ame Dexterity there, he had gotten perfectly clear: That he had no Time to lo&s;e was mo&s;t certain, for he had not been many Mi|nutes gone before a Detachment of the Blue Guards was &s;ent to his Hou&s;e to Arre&s;t him.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Leathes,</HI> Re&s;ident of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> who arrived from <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> much about that time, hear|ing of the E&s;cape of the &s;aid Baron <HI>de Gortz,</HI> went back thither immediately, and upon Advice that the <HI>20th,</HI> being <HI>Saturday</HI> Morning, the &s;aid Baron <HI>de Gortz</HI> was &s;et out from <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> he employ'd Commi&s;&s;ary <HI>Vleertman</HI> to follow him, with another Gentleman; and they u&s;ed &s;o much Diligence, that notwith&s;tanding the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ter was gone &s;ome Hours before them, they arrived at Night, much about the &s;ame time, at the Gates of <HI>Arnheim,</HI> which being opened, Mr. <HI>Vleertman</HI> followed, at &s;ome di&s;tance, the &s;aid Baron <HI>de Gortz</HI> to an Inn, and immediately went to the chief Burgoma&s;ter, who ri&s;ing from Bed, upon Notice given him, that that Gentleman had &s;omething to impart to him from the <HI>States,</HI> was acquainted with the Orders given to &s;ecure the Baron <HI>de Gortz,</HI> whereupon two Town Officers and &s;ome Soldiers were &s;ent to &s;eize him and his Papers, and they brought him, with his Secretary, to the Town-Hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="317">
The Seizing this Gentleman made a great Noi&s;e, and the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Re&s;ident in <HI>Holland</HI> reclaim'd him in the Name of the King of <HI>Sweden;</HI> and pre&s;ented a Memorial to the <HI>States,</HI> to which he annexed an authentick Copy of the full Powers given by the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> to the Baron <HI>Gortz,</HI> alledging, That he ought to be look'd upon as a Publick Mini|&s;ter, and that the Law of Nations had been violated in the Seizing a Per&s;on, who was even in that Country under a publick Character.</P>
<P>Hitherto the Weight of Things lay upon Count <HI>Gyllenborg</HI> and the Baron <HI>Gortz,</HI> and it might be true that they were embark'd with the <HI>Preten|der</HI>'s Party here, for ought appear'd to the con|trary; but the Que&s;tion &s;eem'd to remove from thence to the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> him&s;elf; who &s;eem'd to be Charged with a Vi&s;ible de&s;ign in favour of the <HI>Pretender;</HI> what Evidence there was that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> was concern'd in it, or that what the&s;e Gentlemen, tho' they were his Maje&s;tys Agents, had done by his Orders and &s;tructions, may be enquired as I go along: I mu&s;t profe&s;s to &s;ee very little of it hitherto, and the di&s;|mi&s;&s;ing the two <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ters afterwards, in the Manner they were di&s;mi&s;s'd, &s;eems to me not to im|port, that the Concern the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> was &s;aid to have in it, did &s;ufficiently appear; but that is not the pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s, I return to the Fact.</P>
<P>On the <HI>20th</HI> of the next Month, <HI>(viz.) February,</HI> the Parliament met pur&s;uant to the Prorogation, and the King open'd the Se&s;&s;ion with the following Speech, in which his Maje&s;ty took publick Notice of this Affair.</P>
<Q><PB N="53" REF="318">
<P>My Lords and Gentlemen,</P>
<P>I <HI>Was in hopes that the Succe&s;s which it plea&s;ed God to give &V;s, in Defeating the late Rebellion, might have &s;ecured to the Nation Peace, Plenty, and Tranquillity.</HI></P>
<P><HI>My Endeavours have not been wanting, during your Rece&s;s, to improve the happy Pro&s;pect which was in View, by entring into &s;uch Negotiations as I judged mo&s;t conducive to tho&s;e good Ends; and 'tis with Plea&s;ure I can acquaint you, that many Defects in the Treaties of</HI> Utrecht, <HI>which very nearly affected the Trade, and even the Security of the&s;e Kingdoms, have been remedy'd by &s;ub&s;e|quent Conventions, the happy Con&s;equences of which have already very &s;en&s;ibly appeared by the Flouri&s;h|ing Condition of our Trade and Credit.</HI></P>
<P><HI>By the Alliance lately concluded with</HI> France, <HI>and the</HI> States-General, <HI>We are &s;oon to be Ea&s;ed of all future Apprehen&s;ions from</HI> Dunkirk <HI>and</HI> Mardyke: <HI>The</HI> Pretender <HI>is actually removed beyond the</HI> Alps; <HI>his Adherents are deprived of all Hopes of Support and Countenance from</HI> France; <HI>and even the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of that Crown is Stipulated to Us in ca&s;e of Exigency.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It &s;eemed rea&s;onable to expect, that &s;uch a Sci|tuation of Affairs at Home and Abroad &s;hould have recovered from their Delu&s;ion all &s;uch of our Subjects as had Unhappily been Seduced by the Craft and Wickedne&s;s of De&s;perate and Ill-de&s;igning Men, and thereby have afforded Me the Opportunity, which I de&s;ired, of following the Natural Bent of My own Inclinations to Lenity, by Opening this Se&s;|&s;ion with an Act of Grace; but &s;uch is the Ob&s;ti|nate and Inveterate Rancour of a Faction among&s;t</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="319">
<HI>&V;s, that it hath again prompted them to animate and &s;tir up Foreign Powers to di&s;turb the Peace of their Native Country; they will chu&s;e rather to make</HI> Britain <HI>a Scene of Blood and Confu&s;ion, and to Venture even the putting this Kingdom under a Foreign Yoke, than give over their darling De&s;ign of Impo&s;ing a Popi&s;h Pretender.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I have Ordered to be laid before You, Copies of Letters which have pa&s;&s;ed between the</HI> Swedi&s;h <HI>Mi|ni&s;ters on this Occa&s;ion, which contain a certain Account of the projected Inva&s;ion; and I promi&s;e My Self from your experienced Zeal and Affection to my Per&s;on and Government, that you will come to &s;uch Re&s;olutions as will enable Me, by the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, to defeat all the De&s;igns of Our Enemies again&s;t &V;s.</HI></P></Q>
<Q><P>Gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Commons,</P>
<P><HI>I did hope the putting an End to the late Re|bellion would have &s;o far &s;ecured the Peace and Tranquillity of the Nation, that I might, con&s;i&s;tent|ly with the Safety of My People, have made a con|&s;iderable Reduction of the Forces; but the Prepa|rations which are making from Abroad to Invade Us, oblige Me to ask &s;uch Supplies as you &s;hall find ab&s;olutely Nece&s;&s;ary for the Defence of the Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P><HI>You are all Sen&s;ible of the In&s;upportable Weight of the National D$bts, which the Publick became Engaged for, from the Nece&s;&s;ity of the Times, the Pre&s;&s;u$es of a long and expen&s;ive War, and the lan|gui&s;hing State of Publick Credit; but the Scene being n$w &s;o happily changed, if no new Di&s;turbances &s;hall pl$nge &V;s again into Streights and Difficulties, the general Expectation &s;eems to require of You, that</HI>
<PB N="55" REF="320">
<HI>You &s;hould turn your Thoughts toward &s;ome Method of extricating Your Selves, by Reducing, by Degrees, the Debts of the Nation.</HI></P></Q>
<Q><P>My Lords and Gentlemen,</P>
<P><HI>I have an entire Confidence in You, and have there|fore nothing to ask, but that you would take &s;uch Mea|&s;ures as will be&s;t Secure your Religion and Liber|ties: While you pre&s;erve tho&s;e ine&s;timable Ble&s;&s;ings, I &s;hall &s;it Ea&s;ie and Safe on My Throne, having no other View but the Happine&s;s and Pro&s;perity of My People.</HI></P></Q>
<P>According to the Contents of this Speech, the next Day the Letters of Count <HI>Gyllenborg</HI> were, by his Maje&s;ty's &s;pecial Command, laid before the Hou&s;e of Commons, and were afterwards made Publick by the Order of the Government.</P>
<P>It would have been very nece&s;&s;ary for the Infor|mation of the Reader, and for convincing them more effectually of the Reality of this Con&s;piracy, which is &s;o confidently ridiculed and denied: I &s;ay, it would have been very nece&s;&s;ary to have tran&s;mit|ted to Po&s;terity the full Copies of the&s;e Letters at large; but the Brevity of the&s;e Annals will not per|mit it.</P>
<P>The Addre&s;&s;es of both Hou&s;es to the King, in return to this Speech, tho' I have very little Room for &s;uch Things, cannot be omitted, becau&s;e they &s;hew how readily the Hou&s;es came into &s;uch Things as the&s;e, and that Readine&s;s will occa&s;ion farther Speculations as I go on: The Addre&s;&s;es therefore, and An&s;wers to them, are as follow, <HI>(viz.)</HI></P>

return your Maje&s;ty their humble&s;t Thanks for your mo&s;t gracious Speech from the Throne.

We can never &s;ufficiently acknowledge the re|peated In&s;tances of your Maje&s;ty's Goodne&s;s, and un|wearied Concern for the Welfare of your Kingdoms; We &s;ee with Admiration, many of the fatal Defects of the Treaties at</HI> Utrecht, <HI>and the great Di&s;advan|tages that were impo&s;ed upon this Nation, at the Head of a victorious Army, and powerful Confedera|cy, happily remedy'd by your Maje&s;ty, even in the mid&s;t of inte&s;tine Dangers and Troubles. Your con|&s;ummate Wi&s;dom has renewed tho&s;e Alliances that were ba&s;ely betray'd and di&s;&s;olved, and concluded &s;uch new Treaties, as may render the Peace &s;afe and la&s;ting; and we are at a Lo&s;s to determine whether, in future Ages, the &s;uffering the Demolition of the Port of</HI> Dunkirk <HI>to be &s;candalou&s;ly evaded, will be a greater Reproach, or the procuring the De&s;truction of the Sluices of</HI> Mardyke, <HI>a greater Honour to the</HI> Briti&s;h <HI>Nation.</HI></P>

<P><HI>That who&s;oever &s;hall advance, or lend any Sum, not exceeding Six Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds, for the Service of the Publick</HI> by Sea or Land, <HI>&s;hall be repaid the &s;ame</HI> with Intere&s;t at 4 per Cent. <HI>out of the fir&s;t Aid to be granted this Se&s;&s;ion of Parlia|ment.</HI></P></Q>
<P>This prov'd a wrong Step, for this Clau&s;e of ad|vancing Money at <HI>4 per Cent.</HI> Intere&s;t, put the Que&s;tion out of all manner of Di&s;pute among the Money'd Men, that Intere&s;t of Money would be reduced this Se&s;&s;ion to <HI>4 per Cent.</HI> e&s;pecially, that the Intere&s;t of the Funds would fall to <HI>4 per Cent.</HI> and this put the City Mi&s;ers, and the Money'd Men, into a terrible Fright; and in a Word, no Body, for &s;ome Time, brought any Money, that is, any Sums con&s;iderable upon the Credit of that Vote, nor did it at all an&s;wer the Expectations of the People who contrived it; and becau&s;e this great Affair was now very quickly brought to a Conclu&s;ion, I &s;hall put the whole Tran&s;action of
<PB N="62" REF="327">
it together: That the Reduction of the Intere&s;t of the Funds was projected, and Schemes for it prepar'd in the Trea&s;ury, Mr. <HI>Walpole,</HI> who was then fir&s;t Commi&s;&s;ioner, and therefore at the Head of that Affair, had publickly own'd and declared in the Hou&s;e, that by a fix'd Day he would make a Pro|po&s;al to the Hou&s;e for reducing the publick Debts.</P>
<P>In the mean Time the Di&s;contents of the Peo|ple about the Funds, and the Fears they were un|der for their Properties, grew very popular, and Mr. <HI>L&mdash;mere</HI> propo&s;ed a Vote to the Hou&s;e, which whether it was ill-natur'd or not, as &s;ome &s;aid, or that it was pointed in particular at the Schemes which were preparing, I do not affirm; but had it pa&s;s'd as propos'd, Mr. <HI>Wa&mdash;le</HI> might have put an End to that Part of his Work: The Vote was this, <HI>(viz.) That this Hou&s;e will make good all Parliamen|tary Engagements.</HI> Mr. <HI>W&mdash;le</HI> was too penetrating not to &s;ee what would be the Con&s;equence of this Vote, and too ready in his Turns not to give it a Ca&s;t that quite over&s;et the De&s;ign, <HI>(viz.)</HI> by mo|ving that the Vote might pa&s;s, with the Addition of the Word Deficiencies; this was thought rea&s;on|able, and &s;o the Vote pa&s;s'd thus: <HI>Re&s;olv'd, That this Hou&s;e will make good the Deficiencies of all Par|liamentary Engagements.</HI></P>
<P>This Addition entirely de&s;troy'd and di&s;arm'd the Motion it &s;elf, and yet it had the Effect it was mov'd for, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That it &s;atisfy'd the People, that they &s;hould not have any unju&s;t Inva&s;ion of their Proper|ties; and &s;o Mr. <HI>Wa&mdash;le</HI> went on as he began.</P>
<P>In the Interval, between this Vote and the Time Mr. <HI>Wa&mdash;le</HI> took to bring in his Scheme, the Hou&s;e ordered in <HI>An Account of the Publick Debts at the Exchequer, as they then &s;tood, di&s;tingui&s;hing what</HI>

Upon the Day appointed, Mr. <HI>Walpole</HI> brought in his Scheme for the reducing the Debts, and ha|ving in the mean time negotiated with the Bank and the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Company, to perform their Parts if required, he pre&s;ented it to the Hou&s;e, and had it debated at large; the Scheme indeed met with &s;ome Oppo&s;ition, and, as is often the Ca&s;e in other Things, more perhaps from tho&s;e who did not un|der&s;tand it, than from tho&s;e who did: However in the End the Hou&s;e came into it, and from thence proceeded the Reductions which now take Place, and which are expre&s;s'd in the following Vote.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>That all the Publick Funds, redeemable by Law, that do not exceed</HI> 5 l. per Cent. per Ann. <HI>be redeemed according to the re&s;pective Provi&s;o's or Clau&s;es of Redemption, contained in the Acts of Parliament for that Purpo&s;e, or (with Con&s;ent of the Proprietors) be converted into an Intere&s;t or Annuity, not exceeding</HI> 5 l. per Cent. per An|num, <HI>redeemable by Parliament.</HI></P>

<P N="13">XIII. <HI>That all Savings that &s;hall ari&s;e upon any of the pre&s;ent Funds, by the propo&s;ed Redemptions or Reductions, be re&s;erv'd and apply'd, after all Deficiencies that may happen upon any of the &s;aid Funds are made good, towards di&s;charging and re|ducing the National Debt.</HI></P>
<P N="14">XIV. <HI>That all the &s;aid Duties now in being, or to be continued, &s;hall immediately cea&s;e and deter|mine, after the &s;aid National Debt, and all Inte|re&s;t due thereupon, is di&s;charged and paid off.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Votes give us a full View of that Affair, and the Acts of Parliament &s;ub&s;equent to them, which are to be found upon Record, will fully in|form tho&s;e who are curious to enquire farther; and thus this trouble&s;ome Affair was ended, to the general Satisfaction.</P>
<P>As for the Di&s;putes which happen'd about a far|ther Reduction of Forces, and the Regulation of tho&s;e which were to be kept on Foot, they did indeed &s;tir a little; but the Affair of the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Inva&s;ion, which was now upon the Anvil, &s;ilenc'd all tho&s;e Things for this Se&s;&s;ion, we &s;hall hear more of them in the next: I will not ju&s;tify the Words of tho&s;e who ventur'd to talk as if that were one of the Cau&s;es of bringing it upon the Stage.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="357">
But Debates of another Nature came upon the Stage, in which the Mini&s;ters &s;o unhappily cla&s;h'd with one another, as reviv'd all the Strife mention'd before, and entirely broke the Harmony of the pub|lick Mea&s;ures for a while.</P>
<P>It was on the <HI>3d</HI> of <HI>April,</HI> when the King &s;ent the following Me&s;&s;age to the Hou&s;e of Commons.</P>
<P>GEORGE <HI>R.</HI></P>
<P><HI>HIS Maje&s;ty being de&s;irous, above all Things, not only to &s;ecure his Kingdoms again&s;t the pre&s;ent Danger, with which they are threaten'd from</HI> Sweden, <HI>but likewi&s;e to prevent, as far as is po&s;&s;ible, the like Apprehen&s;ions for the future, thinks it nece&s;&s;ary, that &s;uch Mea&s;ures &s;hould be early con|certed with other Princes and States, as may con|duce mo&s;t effectually to this End.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And as this may require &s;ome Expence, His Ma|je&s;ty hopes that his Commons will, by their A&s;&s;i|&s;tance at this Juncture, enable Him to make good &s;uch Engagements, as may ca&s;e his People of all future Charge and Apprehen&s;ions upon this Ac|count.</HI></P>
<P>This Me&s;&s;age gave Ground of new Contention, and occa&s;ion'd very warm Debates, too long to be &s;et down at large, but the Sub&s;tance of the Objecti|ons was, that the manner of demanding it without communicating the particular U&s;es to which it was to be appropriated, was unparliamentary; it was alledg'd, that as they were entru&s;ted to give the Peoples Money for the Publick Occa&s;ions, &s;o they could not an&s;wer it, as to the Tru&s;t their Country repo&s;ed in them, to give away that Mo|ney without knowing what the Occa&s;ion was; and indeed, this Argument went a great Way, and
<PB N="93" REF="358">
brought &s;ome into the Que&s;tion, who it was not thought could have joined with that Party upon any Account whatever; and tho' it was an&s;wered, that there were good Rea&s;ons why the Terms of the Alliances to be made, could not &s;afely be Com|municated; and that to make the Mea&s;ures pub|lick, was, in the Nature of the Thing, to de&s;troy them; yet even this did not &s;atisfie: It was then urged, that the King was a Prince of that Integri|ty and Honour, and had given &s;uch convincing Proofs of his di&s;intere&s;ted Concern for the true Inte|re&s;t of the People of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> in general, and for their Liberties and Privileges in particular, that they could not &s;cruple to depend, in a Matter of this Nature, upon his Maje&s;ty's Ju&s;tice and Pru|dence in general, as well as upon his Care for the Nation in particular, and that his Maje&s;ty had many ways merited &s;uch a Tru&s;t as this at their Hands.</P>
<P>But to this a Medium was propo&s;ed, <HI>viz.</HI> to pa&s;s a Vote in general Terms, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Hou&s;e would effectually make good all &s;uch Alliances and Engagements as his Maje&s;ty &s;hould think fit to enter into for the publick Safety of his Dominions: And this was urg'd again&s;t the Argument above, of de|pending upon his Maje&s;ty's Integrity and Honour, <HI>viz.</HI> That &s;uch a Vote was a Te&s;timony of their entire Dependence upon the Honour and Integrity of his Maje&s;ty, and that in &s;o high a manner, as that more could not be de&s;ired of them, and that his Maje&s;ty could have no rea&s;on to di&s;tru&s;t his faithful Commons making good &s;uch a Vote.</P>
<P>It would be endle&s;s to repeat the Particulars of all the Arguments warmly urged on both &s;ides on this extraordinary Occa&s;ion. But upon the whole, it is to be ob&s;erv'd, that this Que&s;tion not only di|vided
<PB N="94" REF="359">
the Hou&s;e, but divided the Court, and that to a &s;urprizing Degree, and it was taken notice of in the Hou&s;e; for when one of the contrary Party had in a long Speech in&s;i&s;ted, that it was Unpar|liamentary to grant Money before the Occa&s;ion of it was known, and an E&s;timate of the particular Expence to which it was to be appropriated was laid before the Hou&s;e, he concluded, That the Me&s;|&s;age was &s;o &s;trange in it &s;elf, that even the Mini|&s;try them&s;elves were unhappily divided about it, and knew not whether they had be&s;t be for it, or again&s;t it.</P>
<P>And indeed, this was the Difficulty which principally prevented the better receiving this Me&s;|&s;age, and cau&s;ed a great Party to join in the Oppo|&s;ing it, who were otherwi&s;e very hearty in the King's Intere&s;t, and upon all Occa&s;ions had &s;hewn them&s;elves &s;o; and in this wrong Step began the Di&s;covery of all the ill Blood that was afterwards found to be among the State&s;men, and which cau|&s;ed that great Turn at Court, of which we are go|ing to &s;peak.</P>
<P>And <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It was found that Mr. <HI>Walpole,</HI> tho' he had always &s;trenuou&s;ly pu&s;h'd on the King's In|tere&s;t in every thing, and had been a zealous A&s;&s;er|ter of the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, again&s;t all that had formerly oppo&s;ed it, yet in this he &s;eemed at a full &s;top, and appearing cold and &s;ilent in the hot|te&s;t of the Debate, gave every one room to judge, that he was again&s;t the Thing; tho' when the Que|&s;tion was put, he could not decline giving his Vote in favour of it: Even the Speaker of the Hou&s;e al|&s;o &s;eemed to be on the other &s;ide, and in the Com|mittee &s;poke again&s;t the Thing, as it was &s;tated; being, as he &s;aid, not again&s;t the Supply, but again&s;t
<PB N="95" REF="360">
the Demanding and Granting it in &s;uch an <HI>unparlia|mentary Manner.</HI></P>
<P>Nor indeed was it po&s;&s;ible to prevent a great ma|ny other Gentlemen, who were otherwi&s;e entirely well affected, and even devoted to the pre&s;ent Settle|ment, from falling in with that popular Notion, of its being Unparliamentary; &s;o that when it came to be put to the Que&s;tion in the Committee of the whole Hou&s;e, it pa&s;s'd by a Majority of but 15 Voices, <HI>viz.</HI> Yeas 164. Noes 149.</P>
<P>The Vote that was put and pa&s;s'd was in the following Terms: <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><Q>Re&s;olved, <HI>That it is the Opinion of this Committee, that a Sum not exceeding Two Hundred and Fifty Thou&s;and Pounds be granted to His Maje&s;ty, to enable His Maje&s;ty to concert &s;uch Mea&s;ures with Foreign Princes and States, as may prevent any Charge and Apprehen&s;ion from the De&s;igns of</HI> SWEDEN <HI>for the future.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Nor was this all, for when it was reported by the Chairman, and came again to be Debated in the Hou&s;e, the Struggle was yet harder: And the Que&s;tion, whether the Hou&s;e &s;hould agree with the Committee, was carried but by 4 Voices, <HI>viz.</HI> Yeas 153, Noes 149. So that it &s;eem'd to be a Point gain'd with the utmo&s;t Difficulty, and the Con&s;equences of bringing up a Party &s;o near to an Equality with the Intere&s;t of the Government, were threatning enough.</P>
<P>In the Debates of this Affair, the future Mea|&s;ures took their Ri&s;e, and the King &s;eem'd re&s;olv'd to let &s;ome People know his Mind upon it; for the next Morning Mr Secretary <HI>St inhope,</HI> by particular Command, let the Lord <HI>Town&s;hend</HI> know, that he
<PB N="96" REF="361">
had no farther Occa&s;ion for his Service as Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland;</HI> and this is the la&s;t Time our Annals will find this noble Per&s;on at Court.

<P>Upon the&s;e Removes it appear'd nece&s;&s;ary to grant the Hou&s;e a &s;hort Rece&s;s, and particularly, there being &s;o many Men advanc'd to publick Employ|ment, who were Members of the Hou&s;e, and who could not &s;it again in the Hou&s;e unle&s;s they were Re-elected, it was needful to give them &s;ome Time to form their Intere&s;ts in the Country, and be cho|&s;en again, as mo&s;t of them indeed were; for this, and perhaps other Rea&s;ons le&s;s Publick, the King ordered Mr. <HI>Stanhope</HI> to acquaint the Hou&s;e, that it being his Maje&s;ty's Plea&s;ure that the Parliament &s;hould be adjourn'd, his Maje&s;ty de&s;ir'd that they would adjourn them&s;elves to the <HI>18th</HI> of <HI>May.</HI> This was the <HI>16th</HI> of <HI>April,</HI> &s;o that the Rece&s;s was much longer than was expected, being a full Month.</P>
<P>This Rece&s;s of the Parliament, gives us room to bring forward the Story of what other material Affairs occurr'd, as well before, as during this time,
<PB N="99" REF="364">
that things may be carried on Hand in Hand, one with another, in the &s;ame order of Time as they happen'd.</P>
<P>All this while, the Preparations for a vigorous Dealing with the <HI>Swedes</HI> went on; the Fleet, which was determined to be &s;ent to the <HI>Baltick,</HI> began to be ready, and the <HI>2d</HI> of <HI>April</HI> &s;et Sail with a fair Wind, under the Command of Sir <HI>George Bing,</HI> and arriv'd the <HI>12th</HI> in the <HI>Sound,</HI> in all, 33 Sail.</P>
<P>And here it is to be noted, that by the late Trea|ty of Alliance with <HI>France,</HI> one of the Particulars &s;tipulated in the Alliance was, that the Regent of <HI>France</HI> &s;hould undertake to remove the Pretender from <HI>Avignon,</HI> where he had re&s;ided for &s;ome time, indeed for almo&s;t all the Time &s;ince his Retreat from <HI>Scotland.</HI> This was done publickly by the Regent, and not without &s;ome ill Nature and Re|&s;entment on both Sides; for the Regent in&s;i&s;ted that he &s;hould Remove, and the Chevalier refu&s;ed a good while, and at la&s;t comply'd with Reluctance; nor perhaps had not remov'd at all, but by Force, if the Regent had not plough'd with the Heifer, and u&s;ed &s;ome &s;uch Arguments with the Queen Dowager, as obliged her to write to the Chevalier to di&s;pute it no longer; in which Particular the Regent &s;hew'd, that he knew how to manage that Affair in a Manner, that he was &s;ure would not be oppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Journal of Circum&s;tances of his Removal are publick, but need not to be reported here at large; this being not a Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Chevalier,</HI> but of King <HI>George,</HI> it is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that he removed from <HI>Avignon</HI> the <HI>6th</HI> of <HI>February,</HI> with a Retinue of about 30 Per&s;ons; he had a Captain with a Troop of Dragoons, appointed by the Re|gent to attend him thro' the Territories of <HI>France,</HI>
<PB N="100" REF="365">
and al&s;o four Commi&s;&s;aries, who were order'd to defray their Expences, which was done till he pa&s;s'd the <HI>Pont &agrave; Voi&s;in,</HI> being the Bridge which parts or rather joins the Dominions of <HI>France</HI> to tho&s;e of <HI>Savoy,</HI> where the <HI>French</HI> Officer, having Votaries with him, took proper In&s;truments of Prote&s;t, with Witne&s;&s;es, that the Chevalier, with all his Retinue, were pa&s;s'd the &s;aid <HI>Pont &agrave; Voi&s;in,</HI> the <HI>17th,</HI> into the Dutchy of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and on the Road to <HI>Cham|berry;</HI> from hence he travel'd on thro' the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI>'s Dominions into tho&s;e of the Pope, where he &s;till remains, and where I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak of him again.</P>
<P>I return now in the Cour&s;e of Story to the Affairs of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and the Alarm given here upon that Occa&s;ion, the Troops the King had on Foot were very con&s;iderable, no le&s;s than 27000 Men, and up|on this Occa&s;ion were fill'd up and encrea&s;ed con&s;i|derably, and a Fleet was fitted out with &s;uch Expe|dition, that 30 Men of War were ready to put to Sea, and did put to Sea by the <HI>2d</HI> of <HI>April,</HI> no <HI>Swedes</HI> nor any one el&s;e being in any Po&s;ture to op|po&s;e them, nor when they came to the Sound did they find any Fleets prepared, or Army embarking, or indeed any vi&s;ible Appearance of an Enemy to oppo&s;e them.</P>
<P>Upon this News the Hurry went over, the Con|&s;ternation abated, and repeated A&s;&s;urances coming over every Day that the Danger was all over, the King re&s;olved to reduce his Army, and to grant the long expected Act of Clemency which &s;o many wanted, and which the &s;everal Di&s;orders mention'd had cau&s;ed to be &s;o often delay'd; all which is fully expre&s;s'd in the King's Speech which he made to the Parliament, when they return'd after their Ad|journment above-mention'd: The Speech is as fol|lows.</P>

<Q><P>My Lords and Gentlemen,</P>
<P><HI>IT is with great Satisfaction, that, after this &s;hort Rece&s;s, I can acquaint you with the certain Advice I have received, that my Fleet is &s;afely ar|rived in the</HI> Sound, <HI>which, by the Ble&s;&s;ing of Al|mighty God, will &s;ecure the&s;e Kingdoms again&s;t any immediate Danger of an Inva&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I have, by this means, an Opportunity, which is very acceptable to me, of making a con&s;iderable Re|duction in our Land-Forces, having e&s;tabli&s;h'd it as a Rule with my Self, to con&s;ult the Ea&s;e of my Peo|ple in every Thing, &s;o far as is con&s;i&s;tent with their Safety. And for my own part, as I &s;hall always place my Greatne&s;s in the Pro&s;perity of my Sub|jects, &s;o I &s;hall always de&s;ire, that my Power may be founded in their Affections.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It is upon the&s;e Con&s;iderations, that I have given Orders for the immediate Reducing of Ten Thou&s;and Men.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That nothing may be wanting in me to quiet the Minds of all my Subjects, I have likewi&s;e given Di|rections to prepare an Act of Grace; and however it may be received by tho&s;e who are ob&s;tinately bent on the Ruin of their Country, I promi&s;e my &s;elf, that it will rai&s;e a due Sen&s;e of Gratitude in all &s;uch as have been artfully mi&s;led into Trea&s;onable Practices again&s;t my Per&s;on and Government, and pre&s;erve them from &s;tanding in need of the like Mercy for the future, when &s;uch an In&s;tance of Clemency may not be &s;o expedient for the Publick Welfare, as it would be agreeable to my own Inclinations.</HI></P></Q>
<Q><P>Gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Commons,</P>
<P><HI>I thank you for your readine&s;s to Support me in the pre&s;ent Juncture of Affairs, and for the Supplies</HI>
<PB N="102" REF="367">
<HI>which you have given me, and do promi&s;e you, that they &s;hall be employ'd for the &V;&s;es to which you de|&s;ign'd them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I &s;hall order &s;uch faithful Accounts to be laid before you the next Se&s;&s;ion, as will make it appear, there was no other View in asking any particular Supply, than to prevent a much greater Expence, which the Nation mu&s;t have unavoidably incurred without it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I mu&s;t recommend to you, as I did at the Beginning of the Se&s;&s;ion, to take all proper Methods for Re|ducing the Publick Debts, with a ju&s;t Regard to Par|liamentary Credit.</HI></P></Q>
<Q><P>My Lords and Gentlemen,</P>
<P><HI>The Year being &s;o far advanced, I hope you will go through the Publick Bu&s;ine&s;s with all po&s;&s;ible Di&s;|patch and &V;nanimity, it being my Intention to meet you early the next Winter, that the Sitting of Par|liament may be brought into the more u&s;ual and con|venient Sea&s;on.</HI></P></Q>
<P>The Addre&s;&s;es and An&s;wers which follow'd this Speech, being Matters of meer Form, I omit as not material to the Story, and to be found in the Votes of this Se&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame Time the Parliament was &s;itting here, the General A&s;&s;embly was conven'd in <HI>Scotland;</HI> but when I have noted, that the Earl of <HI>Rothes</HI> was Commi&s;&s;ioner, that he went down, deliver'd the King's Letter, open'd the A&s;&s;embly the <HI>2d</HI> of <HI>May</HI> with a Speech, received an An&s;wer the <HI>4th</HI> to the King, and clo&s;ed the A&s;&s;embly with another Speech the <HI>16th:</HI> I &s;ay, when this is &s;aid, I think every thing of Moment which pa&s;s'd there is &s;ufficiently mention'd.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="368">
In the mean Time, a new Broil agitated the Hou&s;e of Commons for &s;ome Days, and rai&s;ed great Heats among the Members; this related to General <HI>Cado|gan,</HI> about the Expence of bringing over the 6000 Men, which the <HI>Dutch</HI> lent his Maje&s;ty again&s;t the Rebellion, the Tran&s;porting the&s;e Men, it &s;eems, co&s;t the Government <HI>11000l.</HI> whereas they were &s;hip'd back again for le&s;s than a <HI>4th</HI> Part of the Mo|ney: This Que&s;tion was argued warmly, and the extravagant Sum was accounted for, only by the Ha&s;te and Hurry of getting the Men over, the length of their March, and the difficulty of getting Ships to Tran&s;port them at &s;o &s;hort a Warning: However, it was pa&s;s'd over, and the Committee coming to no Re&s;olution, the Speaker re&s;umed the Chair, &s;o that it was not &s;o much as mention'd in the Votes, or taken Notice of, that any &s;uch thing had been debated in the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e had now little Bu&s;ine&s;&s; before them but that of the Money, and as the Payment of the Publick Debts was the great Thing in View, &s;o the Manner of doing it for this Year, is be&s;t under&s;tood by the Propo&s;als negotiated, as I had ob&s;erv'd be|fore, by the <HI>Bank</HI> and <HI>South-Sea</HI> Company, and by which the Government was enabled to have an&s;wer'd the Demands of the Proprietors of the Funds, who&s;e Intere&s;t was to be reduced, if they had come for their Money. The&s;e Propo&s;als therefore, being with a very little Variation accepted and enacted, it is ve|ry proper to record them here, that they may be of u&s;e to tho&s;e Readers, who cannot on all Occa&s;ions have Recour&s;e to the Acts them&s;elves: The Propo|&s;als are as follow, <HI>(viz.)</HI></P>

<P>The Right Honourable the Lords <Q>&startq;Commi&s;&s;io|ners of his Maje&s;ty's Trea&s;ury give Notice, that they have required the Payma&s;ters and Comp|trollers of the Orders in the Lotteries now &s;ub|&s;cribing for Annuities, their Deputies and Clerks, to give con&s;tant and diligent Attendance in their Offices daily <HI>(Sundays</HI> excepted) from Eight in the Morning to One, and from Three to Six in the Afternoon, to direct and pay, with the utmo&s;t Expedition, all Arrears of Intere&s;t on the Orders in every of the &s;aid Lotteries, to and for the Quarter ended at <HI>Mid&s;ummer</HI> la&s;t 1717, Money &s;ufficient being put by their Lord&s;hips into the Hands of the re&s;pective Payma&s;ters of the &s;aid&endq; Lottery Orders for that Purpo&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>This Publication being made, and the Books opened, it was &s;oon &s;een which way the Stream would run; for as in the fir&s;t Place, there were few or none that de&s;ired to take their Money, &s;o if there had been ever &s;o many, there were People al|ways ready, and Money lodg'd by private Hands with the Clerks, to buy the Intere&s;t of any that de|&s;ired to part with it, and to be entred in their &s;tead; &s;o that if the Proprietors of all tho&s;e Lottery Orders had demanded their Money, it was plain, that the Government needed not to have call'd upon
<PB N="113" REF="378">
the <HI>Bank</HI> or <HI>South-Sea</HI> Company for one Farthing, and thus at the Time of the Writing the&s;e Sheets, we find, the Books being clo&s;ed, there is but <HI>471 l. 4 s. 0 d.</HI> demanded in Money, all the re&s;t being &s;ub&s;crib'd to continue upon the &s;ame Security at <HI>5 l. per Cent.</HI> Intere&s;t, the Sum amounting to <HI>Nine Mil|lions, Two Hundred and Thirty Thou&s;and, Eight Hundred and Seventy Three Pounds, Eighteen Shil|lings and Four Pence;</HI> &s;o that, <HI>we &s;ay,</HI> 'tis evident, the <HI>Government</HI> will not have occa&s;ion on this <HI>Ac|count</HI> for one Penny of that Money which the &s;aid <HI>Communities</HI> are to furni&s;h.</P>
<P>I am now coming to the clo&s;e of the Se&s;&s;ion, which was chiefly taken up with Di&s;putes between the two Hou&s;es, in their judicial Affairs, and parti|cularly the famous Ca&s;e in Parliament of the Earl of <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>That truly great Man had been now under Con|finement almo&s;t two Years, and had this Se&s;&s;ion been let &s;lip, and was likely enough to lie there ano|ther Year; whether unea&s;y at the Length of his Confinement, or with his u&s;ual Penetration, percei|ving the critical Juncture of his Deliverance to be before him; I &s;ay, whether of the&s;e I do not en|quire: But the Earl, with the &s;ame calm Courage with which he put him&s;elf into the Hands of the Parliament at fir&s;t, when he might, had he doubted his Innocence, or their Ju&s;tice, have &s;ecur'd him&s;elf: I &s;ay, with the &s;ame calm Courage he now re&s;ol|ved to Court his Danger, and ca&s;ting the Die for Life or Death, Petitions the Hou&s;e to have his Ca&s;e taken into Con&s;ideration: I cannot omit &s;ome Lines which I have met with, as Part of a De&s;crip|tion of his Ca&s;e on this Occa&s;ion, and which, I think, do but Ju&s;tice to the inimitable Re&s;olution and Bravery of Mind with which he put him&s;elf
<PB N="114" REF="379">
into the Hands of publick Ju&s;tice, when it mu&s;t be own'd, the Stream of popular Feud ran &s;o high, that it was enough, if po&s;&s;ible, to terrifie even In|nocence it &s;elf: The Lines were the&s;e.</P>
<Q><L>Great Heart who taught thee thus unmov'd to Die,</L>
<L>To Rate thy Blood to Law, thy Fame &s;o high:</L>
<L>Did the lea&s;t Spot upon thy Soul appear?</L>
<L>It could not be: Such Courage &s;peaks thee clear.</L>
<L>For Guilt mu&s;t ha betray'd it &s;elf by Fear.</L></Q>
<P>And as I am mentioning the Courage of the Earl's Surrender, as an Argument of his Innocence, &s;o without tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing upon the Impartiality of an Hi|&s;torian, I mu&s;t in Ju&s;tice &s;ay, that never more Ho|nour was done to the Ju&s;tice of the Hou&s;e of Peers, by any Man that ever I read of in Hi&s;tory, than was done by this noble Per&s;on, in ca&s;ting him&s;elf into their Hands &s;o boldly, &s;o chearfully depending up|on their Ju&s;tice, Honour and impartial Proceedings; and this when his Life was in the mo&s;t manife&s;t Ha|zard, as well from both the Number as the Rage of his Enemies: And when this Temper, <HI>or rather want Temper,</HI> di&s;cover'd &s;o evidently a Thir&s;t after his Ruin; when his Friends di&s;pair'd for him, and lay at him Night and Day, with the Exhortations of the fainter hearted Apo&s;tle, <HI>Ma&s;ter, &s;ave thy &s;elf;</HI> when others more fam'd for Courage dur&s;t not &s;tand it, and when the Voice of Numbers were evidently again&s;t him.</P>
<P>It will not be pretended that he was ignorant how ea&s;ily the Con&s;titution it&s;elf &s;ometimes gives way to popular Clamours, how often Innocence is run down by Crowd, and the cleare&s;t Truth &s;mo|ther'd with the Breath of a Majority.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="380">
He was not ignorant how many there were who pur&s;ued him with per&s;onal Pique, how numerous his Enemies were, or how powerful even among the P&mdash;t.</P>
<P>He knew indeed, that his Cau&s;e depended upon the &s;trict Appeal he made to the Laws of his Coun|try; but he was not ignorant how frequently Con&s;ti|tutions are violated, by &s;training the Con&s;tructions both of Law and of Offences, e&s;pecially when the Humour of the Times condemns, or a Man falls a Sacrifice to popular Re&s;entment.</P>
<P>But knowing what Ju&s;tice would demand of the Hou&s;e of Peers, and believing they would always act as became their Dignity, and as Honour and un|bya&s;s'd Ju&s;tice directed them, he ca&s;t his Life into their Hands, honour'd them with believing they were what they ought to be, and that they would never taint their Blood with the unbecoming Cruelty of dipping their Hands in his; unle&s;s the Law un|con&s;train'd, and Evidence unconfuted, &s;hould con|vince them of his Guilt, which he was well a&s;&s;ur'd could not be.</P>
<P>In this, I &s;ay, he put the greate&s;t Honour upon the Peers that it was po&s;&s;ible for any Man to do; and I per&s;uade my &s;elf it will be granted, that as the Hi&s;tory of the pa&s;t Ages can &s;carce &s;hew a Pre|cedent, &s;o it may be long enough before any of his Enemies who boa&s;t of their new Advancements to a Rank which they know not how to de&s;erve, will ever give either a like Te&s;timony of Innocence, or the like Veneration for the Per&s;ons and Honour of the Briti&s;h Nobility.</P>
<P>But I return to the Hi&s;tory. It was the <HI>22d</HI> of <HI>May,</HI> the Earl cau&s;ed a Petition to be pre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e of Lords, &s;ign'd by his Name, &s;etting forth, <HI>That he had been long confin'd, upon an <HI>Im|peachment</HI>
<PB N="116" REF="381">
brought up again&s;t him to their Lord&s;hips Hou&s;e, by the Commons of</HI> Great-Britain, <HI>for</HI> High-Trea&s;on, <HI>and other</HI> High Crimes <HI>and</HI> Mi&s;demeanours; <HI>&s;ubmitting his Ca&s;e to their Lord&s;hips Con&s;ideration, and praying that his Impri&s;onment might not be in|definite.</HI></P>
<P>This Petition was &s;omething &s;urprizing, and was taken by &s;ome to be a Calling upon the Hou&s;e to bring him to Tryal, and for &s;ome time was re&s;ented as &s;uch, at lea&s;t in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons; however, the Lords, who acted with the utmo&s;t Calmne&s;s and Sedatene&s;s, proceeded without taking it by any &s;uch Handle, and heard with Pa|tience whatever the Earl's Friends had to alledge in his Favour, and &s;everal long Speeches were made upon the Niceties and Scruples which offer'd on one &s;ide as well as on the other; particularly, &s;ome of the Lords in&s;i&s;ted in his behalf, that the Im|peachment was <HI>ipfo facto</HI> de&s;troy'd and determin'd, &s;eeing he was not brought to Tryal the &s;ame Se&s;&s;i|ons in which he was Impeached; and that the Prorogation was an actual <HI>Super&s;edeas</HI> to the whole Proceedings; this was warmly Debated, and the Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI> in&s;i&s;ted &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly upon it, that he demanded Leave to enter his Prote&s;tation a|gain&s;t the Vote pa&s;s'd on the other &s;ide: A &s;trange Change in this noble Per&s;on, from the Temper which he &s;hew'd at the Time of the Impeachment!</P>
<P>However, this being over-rul'd or rejected, the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> mov'd to appoint a Day for the Earl's Tryal, which after &s;ome Debates, and appointing a Committee to &s;earch Precedents, was fix'd and appointed; and 'tis to be ob&s;erved here, that the appointing a Day for the Tryal, did not occa&s;ion &s;o long a Debate, as the &s;hortening the Day; and it was &s;omething wonderful to find the Earl's
<PB N="117" REF="382">
Friends pre&s;&s;ing the Hou&s;e to appoint a &s;hort Day; and the Governments Friends, if we may be allow|ed that Di&s;tinction, pleading for Time; as if the Earl was in a greater Readine&s;s or Forwardne&s;s to make his Defence, than the <HI>Commons</HI> were in to make good their Charge.</P>
<P>But &s;o it was, the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> who made the Motion, pre&s;s'd earne&s;tly for a &s;hort Day, and nam'd the <HI>6th</HI> of <HI>June</HI> to be the Day of Tryal; this cau&s;ed &s;everal Speeches and Debates, needle&s;s to be repeated here. However, on a Divi|&s;ion, it was carried for a Week longer, 85 Voices again&s;t 44, and the <HI>13th</HI> of <HI>June</HI> was fix'd for the Earl's Tryal.</P>
<P>As the&s;e Things cau&s;ed long Debates in the <HI>Hou&s;e of Lords,</HI> &s;o the Me&s;&s;age &s;ent to the <HI>Commens,</HI> to acquaint them that the <HI>Lords</HI> had appointed the <HI>13th</HI> of <HI>June</HI> for the Tryal, cau&s;ed long Debates among them: The <HI>Commons</HI> &s;aw the Face of their Affairs a little changed; &s;ome People, who were active and vigorous in this Pro&s;ecution when it was fir&s;t begun, and upon whom the Hou&s;e might be &s;aid, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to depend for the carrying it on, &s;eem'd to look coldly upon the Matter, and to de|cline the Work, or at lea&s;t, to have le&s;s of that Con|fidence which the Hou&s;e u&s;ually &s;hew'd them, and was due to them before. This cau&s;ed a Vote in the Hou&s;e, to appoint a Committee to enquire into the State of the Impeachments at that time depending before the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>This Committe found, upon their Enquiry, that the Secret Committee had &s;uffered &s;ome Di&s;locati|on of Members &s;ince the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion, <HI>viz.</HI> &s;everal Members were called up from it to the Hou&s;e of Peers, as the Lord <HI>On&s;low,</HI> the Lord <HI>Coningshy,</HI> and others; and &s;ome other Members &s;eemed, as is &s;aid,
<PB N="118" REF="383">
to be gone off, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So that the fir&s;t Thing the New Committee for Enquiry, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> did, was to move the Hou&s;e that more Members might be added to the Committee, and the Hou&s;e was mov'd accordingly; upon which <HI>Lawrence Carter,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Sir <HI>William Thomp&s;on,</HI> Recorder of <HI>London,</HI> Ser|jeant <HI>Birch,</HI> and Serjeant <HI>Pingelly,</HI> were added to the Secret Committee; and now they acted open|ly, dropt Mr. <HI>Walpole</HI> out of the Chair, for he was Chairman of the former Committee, whereas now they made Mr. <HI>Lawr. Carter,</HI> Member for the Town of <HI>Leice&s;ter,</HI> Chairman, and then four more were added to the Committee, <HI>viz.</HI> Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> Secretary of State, Mr. <HI>James Craggs</HI> Secretary at War, Mr. Serjeant <HI>Mead,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Je&s;&s;op;</HI> and at another time after that Mr. <HI>Nicholas Lechmere,</HI> who was ju&s;t then recho&s;en into the Hou&s;e, after his being made Chancellor of the Duchy of <HI>Lanca&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus gotten all the eminent Lawyers of the Hou&s;e to be nam'd of the Committee, they fell immediately to the Bu&s;ine&s;s, <HI>viz.</HI> preparing to make good the Articles of Impeachment, in ca&s;e the Hou&s;e &s;hould agree to proceed to the Tryal; but all this while they left the World in &s;u&s;pen&s;e as to their Re&s;olution, even till the Day before the Day ap|pointed for Tryal, when the <HI>Commons</HI> &s;ent a Me&s;|&s;age to the <HI>Lords,</HI> to demand longer Time for their Preparations. This was, according to a Report made to them by the Committee, in the Terms fol|lowing, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<Q><P><HI>That the Committee had met &s;everal Times, and made &s;ome Progre&s;s in the Matters to them referr'd; but that the Pro&s;ecution of the &s;aid Impeachment ha|ving been interrupted for &s;o many Months, by the Intervention of many weighty and urgent Affairs, which</HI>
<PB N="119" REF="384">
<HI>more nearly and immediately concern'd the Welfare, Defence, and Security of the Kingdom; it was be|come ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for tho&s;e who &s;hould be ap|pointed to manage the &s;aid Impeachment, to review, and carefully peru&s;e all the Treaties, Records, Let|ters, and other Papers proper and nece&s;&s;ary for &s;up|porting this Pro&s;ecution; which being very volumi|nous, it would be impo&s;&s;ible, within the Time ap|pointed for the Tryal, to adju&s;t and apply the pro|per Evidence to the &s;everal Articles.</HI></P></Q>
<P>This Me&s;&s;age being &s;ent to the <HI>Lords,</HI> they gran|ted Time to the <HI>24th</HI> of <HI>June,</HI> upon which, the <HI>Commons</HI> &s;eriou&s;ly apply'd them&s;elves to prepare for the Tryal; and here it was to be ob&s;erv'd, that the <HI>Earl's Party,</HI> (as they were called) in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Peers,</HI> argued and in&s;i&s;ted &s;ome time upon the fir&s;t Day, alledging, that the <HI>Lords</HI> having fix'd a peremptory Day for the Tryal, they ought not to put it off, or allow any farther Day: What the My&s;tery of their hurrying on the Tryal &s;o warmly was, was not &s;een till afterwards; but the Que&s;tion being put, it was carry'd for a longer Time, as above.</P>
<P>And now the <HI>Commons</HI> began to let it be &s;een, that they re&s;olv'd to go on with the Tryal; and accor|dingly voted Managers for carrying it on: The&s;e were the whole Committee of Secrecy, and no other excepting &s;uch as they then added to the Committee; then they re&s;olv'd, that the Hou&s;e would be pre&s;ent at the Tryal, as a Committee of the whole Hou&s;e, and then voted the u&s;ual Method for their going, no &s;itting at, and coming from the Tryal.</P>
<P>The <HI>24th</HI> of <HI>June</HI> the Tryal began: The Ac|counts of it, which were publi&s;hed by Authority, are my be&s;t Guides in &s;tating the whole Affair, which
<PB N="120" REF="385">
however long, requires to be recorded by my Pen, that pretends to write the Hi&s;tory of tho&s;e Times: I &s;hall however contract it within as narrow Com|pa&s;s as Ju&s;tice on both Sides will admit.</P>
<P>The Day being come for the Tryal, and the Earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> Pri&s;oner, being brought up from the <HI>Tower,</HI> the Lords about <HI>Eleven</HI> a Clock mov'd from their Hou&s;e Two by Two in great State, and with all the u&s;ual Formalities, too long to require a Repe|tition in our <HI>Annals.</HI> The Lord <HI>Cowper,</HI> who was appointed Lord High-Steward for the Day, going al&s;o in great State, with the Judges, and with all his proper Officers, into <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall.</HI></P>
<P>On the other Hand, the Commons, according to the Orders above, appeared in the Place a&s;&s;igned for them, the Managers being in a Place &s;eparated for them.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty was al&s;o in the Place appointed for the Royal Family, with the Prince and Prince&s;s of <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P>The whole A&s;&s;embly being plac'd, the Lord High-Steward con&s;tituted the Court, by cau&s;ing his Com|mi&s;&s;ion to be read, receiving the White Staff, and a&s;cending &s;ome Steps to his Seat of Ju&s;tice; and immediately Proclamation was made, to order the Lieutenant of the <HI>Tower</HI> to bring the Pri&s;oner to the Bar, which was done: The Earl coming up to the Bar, kneeled down, and continued kneeling till the Lord High-Steward told him he might ri&s;e; he be|hav'd Grave and Decent, yet Chearful and not De|jected, and when he ro&s;e up from his Knees, bowed with Tokens of Re&s;pect to the Lord High-Steward, and to the Peers, which Civility was re|turned with great Courte&s;ie by them all.</P>
<P>The&s;e Matters of Ceremony being over, the Ar|ticles of Impeachment were read, the Earl's An|&s;wer,

<P>After the Reading the&s;e Things, the Lord <HI>High-Steward</HI> addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the Earl Pri&s;oner, &s;poke as follows:</P>

<P><Q>&startq;But con&s;idering the many great Offices your Lord&s;hip has born in the State, your long Expe|rience and known Learning in all Parliamentary Proceedings, I cannot but think it would &s;eem im|proper for me to be &s;peaking to your Lord&s;hip&endq; in that manner.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Wherefore I proceed barely to acquaint your Lord&s;hip and others whom it may &ccedil;oncern, with &s;uch Orders as the Lords have made, which 'tis fit &s;hould be taken Notice of thus early in this&endq; Tryal.</Q></P>
<P N="1"><Q>&startq;1. Your Lord&s;hip, and all other Per&s;ons who have occa&s;ion to &s;peak to this Court, mu&s;t ad|dre&s;s their Speech to the Lords in general, and&endq; not to any Lord in particular.</Q></P>
<P N="2"><Q>&startq;2. Your Lord&s;hip's Council may be pre&s;ent at the Bar, in order to be heard to any Point or Matter of Law, if &s;uch &s;hall ari&s;e on either of the Articles for High-Trea&s;on; and that you may

<P>This being declared to the <HI>Managers</HI> at the <HI>Lords</HI> return to the Hall, the <HI>Managers</HI> reply'd: <HI>That they conceived it to be &s;o much the undoubted Right of the</HI> Commons <HI>to proceed in their own Method, in Maintenance of the Articles exhibited by them, and did apprehend that this Re&s;olution of their Lord|&s;hips might be of &s;o fatal Con&s;equence to the Rights and Privileges of all the</HI> Commons <HI>of</HI> Great-Bri|tain, <HI>that they could not take upon them to proceed any farther, without re&s;orting to the</HI> Hou&s;e of Com|mons <HI>for their Direction therein.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this Proceeding, Conferences, &s;earching Precedents, and the like Methods of managing &s;uch Di&s;putes, took up &s;ome Days, and in particular, on the <HI>27th,</HI> the <HI>Commons</HI> at a Conference, deliver'd the following Paper to the <HI>Lords,</HI> viz.</P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Commons <HI>having taken into their Con&s;ide|ration your Lord&s;hips Re&s;olution communicated to their Managers, relating to the Proceedings on the Tryal of</HI> Robert <HI>Earl of</HI> Oxford <HI>and Earl</HI> Morti|mer, <HI>and being de&s;irous, as far as in them lies, to maintain a good Corre&s;pondence with your Lord&s;hips, have de&s;ired this Conference, and have commanded us to acquaint your Lord&s;hips, That they conceive it to be the undoubted Right of the</HI> Commons, <HI>to impeach a Peer, either for High-Trea&s;on, or for High Crimes and Mi&s;demeanours, or, if they &s;ee</HI>
<PB N="124" REF="389">
<HI>occa&s;ion, to mix both the one and the other in the &s;ame Accu&s;ation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Impeachment preferr'd again&s;t</HI> Robert <HI>Earl of</HI> Oxford <HI>and Earl</HI> Mortimer <HI>is one continued Ac|cu&s;ation, con&s;i&s;ting of High Crimes and Mi&s;demea|nours, and al&s;o of Charges of High-Trea&s;on. The Facts on which the Articles preceding tho&s;e of High-Trea&s;on are grounded, are laid together in order of Time, and follow one another &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, in the Manner they were committed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As the</HI> Commons <HI>thought this the mo&s;t natural Method for exhibiting the &s;everal Articles again&s;t the &s;aid Earl, they were of Opinion, That they &s;hould proceed in the Proof of the&s;e &s;everal Facts after the &s;ame Method, &s;ince it is manife&s;t, that in laying open the Cour&s;e of &s;uch a wicked Admini|&s;tration, the preceding Parts of it give Light to tho&s;e which follow; and that, the Proof of tho&s;e of High-Trea&s;on.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Your Lord&s;hips received the&s;e &s;everal Articles of Impeachment, without making any Exception a|gain&s;t the Form in which they were exhibited. The &s;aid Earl made his An&s;wer to them in the &s;ame Or|der, and has no where in&s;i&s;ted to be Try'd in any other Method; &s;o that the</HI> Commons <HI>are &s;urpriz'd to find a &s;top put to their Pro&s;ecution by an Ob|jection which has never been &s;tarted by the &s;aid Earl, and which your Lord&s;hips had given them &s;o little Rea&s;on to expect.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To this mu&s;t be added, That as the</HI> Commons <HI>only are Ma&s;ters of the Evidence, and as upon that Ac|count they are be&s;t able to determine, what to Charge fir&s;t, and what next; &s;o they are mo&s;t proper to determine in what Method to proceed for the Advan|tage of the Pro&s;ecution, in the Event of which all</HI>
<PB N="125" REF="390">
<HI>the</HI> Commons <HI>of</HI> Great-Britain <HI>are &s;o highly concern'd.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To which they farther add, That they &s;ee no Rea|&s;on but that your Lord&s;hips may as well invert the whole Order of the Articles, as pre&s;cribe to the</HI> Commons <HI>tho&s;e particular Articles on which they are fir&s;t to proceed, which will nece&s;&s;arily produce &s;uch a Confu&s;ion, both in the Facts and Evidence, as is by no means con&s;i&s;tent with that Clearne&s;s and Per&s;picuity in which the</HI> Commons <HI>think this Affair ought to appear.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Commons, <HI>upon examining Precedents, do find divers Precedents of Impeachments for High-Trea&s;on, and other High Crimes and Mi&s;demea|nours in the &s;ame Accu&s;ation; and do not find that the</HI> Lords <HI>ever objected to &s;uch Proceeding, or e|ver gave Judgment upon any particular Article of an Impeachment before the</HI> Commons <HI>had gone through, and concluded their Evidence upon all the Articles, or &s;o many of them as they thought fit; and the</HI> Commons <HI>are at a lo&s;s to conceive what Argu|ments or Precedents can be brought to &s;upport the Re&s;olution of your Lord&s;hips, to give Judgment upon one part of the &s;ame Accu&s;ation, re&s;erving the other part for a &s;ub&s;equent Tryal, as they are to know what your Lord&s;hips mean by admitting the</HI> Commons <HI>to proceed upon the Articles of High-Crimes and Mi&s;demeanours, after the Judgment is given upon the Articles for High Trea&s;on, &s;uppo&s;ing the Judgment proper for High-Trea&s;on &s;hould be gi|ven again&s;t the &s;aid Earl.</HI></P>
<P><HI>For the&s;e Rea&s;ons, the</HI> Commons <HI>a&s;&s;ert it as their undoubted Right to proceed on the Tryal of</HI> Robert <HI>Earl of</HI> Oxford <HI>and Earl</HI> Mortimer, <HI>after the Method in which their Managers were proceeding, when interrupted by your Lord&s;hips Re&s;olution.</HI></P>

<P>Thus far the Two Hou&s;es debated Things with &s;ome Calmne&s;s, but they grew warmer the next Day, when the <HI>Commons</HI> having con&s;ider'd the Rea|&s;ons above, &s;ent a Me&s;&s;age to the <HI>Lords</HI> to de&s;ire a free Conference, and the <HI>Lords</HI> refu&s;ed it; and now the Party of the Earl of <HI>Oxford</HI> began to &s;ee his Deliverance at hand; for the <HI>Lords</HI> refu&s;ing to grant the <HI>Commons</HI> a free Conference, &s;et the Two Hou&s;es into a new Di&s;pute, and they were going on to great Heights; the <HI>Commons</HI> de&s;iring a Conference of the <HI>Lords</HI> upon this Subject, they gave in a Paper there:</P>
<PB N="129" REF="394">
<Q><P><HI>The</HI> Commons <HI>having taken into Con&s;ideration your</HI> Lord&s;hips <HI>Me&s;&s;age,</HI> viz. That your <HI>Lord&s;hips</HI> did not think fit to give a free Conference on the &s;ubject Matter of the la&s;t Conference, as was de|&s;ired by the <HI>Commons: And they being &s;till de&s;irous, to the utmo&s;t of their Power, to pre&s;erve a good Cor|re&s;pondence with your</HI> Lord&s;hips, <HI>have asked this Conference; and have commanded us to acquaint your</HI> Lord&s;hips, <HI>That they are very much &s;urprizd to find your</HI> Lord&s;hips <HI>deny a free Conference, after your</HI> Lord&s;hips <HI>have already agreed to a Conference de&s;ired by the</HI> Commons <HI>on the &s;ame &s;ubject Matter, and after your</HI> Lord&s;hips <HI>have on your Parts al&s;o de&s;ired a Conference upon the &s;ame Subject. That free Conferences are the mo&s;t ancient and e&s;tabli&s;h|ed Methods for adju&s;ting the Differences that have at any time ari&s;en between the Two Hou&s;es, and, as the</HI> Commons <HI>conceive, is the only Method to pre&s;erve a good Corre&s;pondence between them on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, which, at this Time, is of the highe&s;t Importance; becau&s;e a Mi&s;under&s;tanding on this Ac|count, would tend to defeat the Tryal of the Im|peachment of the</HI> Commons. <HI>That the</HI> Commons <HI>conceive clearly, that the &s;ubject Matter of the la&s;t Conference is not a</HI> Point of Judicature, <HI>but a Point</HI> relating only to the Pro&s;ecution <HI>of the</HI> Commons, <HI>it having ari&s;en before any Matter of Judgment had come before your</HI> Lord&s;hips <HI>upon the Tryal. For which Rea&s;ons the</HI> Commons <HI>conceive, that your</HI> Lord&s;hips <HI>ought not to have denied them a free Conference upon the &s;ubject Matter of the la&s;t Con|ference.</HI></P></Q>
<P>The&s;e Things were read and con&s;idered, but the <HI>Lords</HI> being clear in it, that the <HI>Commons</HI> were in the Wrong, re&s;olv'd to in&s;i&s;t upon it, that they
<PB N="130" REF="395">
ought not to grant them a free Conference upon this Subject; and having put the Que&s;tion again in their Hou&s;e, it pa&s;s'd, not to grant a free Confe|rence, which was &s;ignified to the <HI>Commons;</HI> as al&s;o that the <HI>Lords</HI> would pre&s;ently proceed farther on the Tryal of the Earl.</P>
<P>The <HI>Commons</HI> took no notice of this Me&s;&s;age at all, nay, &s;ome mov'd, as we were told, not to re|ceive it. However, &s;eeing the <HI>Lords</HI> were re&s;olv'd to proceed, the Hou&s;e adjourn'd; &s;ome &s;ugge&s;ted, that this Adjournment was ordered, that they might not receive any more Me&s;&s;ages about it, or be &s;ent to from the Hall to appear at the Tryal.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the <HI>Hou&s;e of Lords</HI> proceeded in the Formalities of Judicature; they went down to the Hall, took their Places in Judgment, ordered the Lieutenant of the <HI>Tower</HI> to bring the Earl to the Bar, and made Proclamation in the&s;e Words: <Q>&startq;Whereas <HI>Robert</HI> Earl of <HI>Oxford</HI> and Earl <HI>Morti|mer,</HI> &s;tands Impeach'd of High Trea&s;on and other High Crimes and Mi&s;demeanours, by the <HI>Hou&s;e of Commons,</HI> in the Name of them&s;elves and of all the <HI>Commons</HI> of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> all Per&s;ons concern'd are to take Notice, that he now &s;tands upon his Tryal, and they may now come forth in&endq; order to make good their Charge.</Q></P>
<P>After this, the Court &s;at perfectly &s;ilent, and looking upon one another as if expecting the <HI>Com|mons</HI> &s;hould appear, this Silence held about a quar|ter of an Hour, when the <HI>Lords</HI> adjourn'd to their Hou&s;e; where the Que&s;tion was put, that the Earl &s;hould be acquitted, and it pa&s;s'd in the Affirmative; and then the Method of giving Judgment was di&s;|cu&s;s'd, the very Words pre&s;cribed, and Directions given to the Lord <HI>High-Steward</HI> concerning the far|ther Proceedings in the Hall.</P>

<P>Thus ended this great Affair, and the Earl's being immediately Di&s;charg'd at the Bar, and paying his Re&s;pects to the Court, and to the Lords, and ha|ving receiv'd the Compliments of his Friends, went away directly to his own Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>However, the <HI>Commons</HI> did not re&s;t here, but on the <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> after, rea&s;&s;uming the Debate men|tioned above, and re&s;olving to &s;hew their Re&s;ent|ment at this Proceeding, they, after a very clo&s;e Debate, re&s;olv'd, that an Addre&s;s &s;hould be pre&s;en|ted to his Maje&s;ty, to except the Earl of <HI>Oxford</HI> out of the <HI>Act of Grace,</HI> which was intended to be brought into the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The Parliament drew now towards a Rece&s;s of their Se&s;&s;ion, and little Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;eem'd to lie before them, except &s;uch Bills as were ready for the Royal A&s;&s;ent; when on the <HI>26th</HI> of <HI>July,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Sun|derland,</HI> by his Maje&s;ty's Order, deliver'd into the Hou&s;e of Lords, the (&s;o long expected) Act of Grace.</P>
<P>It was immediately ordered to be read, and had accordingly all the formal Reading as the Thing re|quir'd, and was pa&s;s'd <HI>Nemine Contradicente,</HI> and &s;ent down to the Hou&s;e of Commons, where it was likewi&s;e read and pa&s;s'd without any Amendment, and return'd to the Lords the &s;ame Afternoon, when
<PB N="136" REF="401">
in the Evening the King came to the Hou&s;e, and put an end to the Se&s;&s;ion with the following Speech.</P>
<Q><P>My Lords and Gentlemen,</P>
<P>I <HI>Cannot put an End to this Se&s;&s;ion, witbout expre&s;|&s;ing my Thanks to you, for the Di&s;patch you have given to the Publick Bu&s;ine&s;s, and declaring the Sa|tisfaction I promi&s;e my Self in Meeting you again early the next Winter, with the &s;ame good Di&s;po&s;i|tions for the Service of your Country. The Mea|&s;ures we have taken in this Parliament, have, by the Ble&s;&s;ing of Almighty God, effectually defeated all the Attempts of our Enemies, both at Home and Abroad; and, as the Principles on which tho&s;e Mea|&s;ures are founded, are equally conducive to the Sup|porting the ju&s;t Rights of the Crown, and the Liber|ties of the People, I &s;hall always per&s;evere in them my &s;elf, and di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e who adhere to them with the &s;ame Steadine&s;s and Re&s;olution.</HI></P></Q>
<Q><P>Gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Commons,</P>
<P><HI>I thank you, in the mo&s;t affectionate Manner, for the Supplies you have granted me, and for that Con|&s;tancy and Zeal which you have &s;hewn in Reducing our National Debts, notwith&s;tanding the many Inci|dents and Ob&s;tructions you have met with in the car|rying on of that great Work. As you have furni&s;h|ed me with the Means of di&s;appointing any De&s;igns of a Foreign Enemy again&s;t the&s;e my Kingdoms, &s;o I cannot but a&s;cribe, in a great Mea&s;ure, the happy Pro&s;pect of our Affairs Abroad, to that Publick Spirit which has appeared in your Proceedings; and has convinc'd the World, that no In&s;inuations or Ar|tifices can divert you from your Duty to your <HI>Sove|reign,</HI>
<PB N="137" REF="402">
and a di&s;intere&s;ted Regard to your Fellow-Subjects.</HI></P></Q>
<Q><P>My Lords and Gentlemen,</P>
<P><HI>It is with great Plea&s;ure that I &s;ee the Tranquil|lity of the Nation &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;h'd, as to admit of an Act of Grace, which I have long de&s;ired a fit Op|portunity to grant. I hope that &s;uch as &s;hall, by this Means, be re&s;tored to the Enjoyment of Secu|rity, and the Protection of tho&s;e Laws again&s;t which they have offended, will have a due Sen&s;e of this my Indulgence, and give me the mo&s;t acceptable Return they can po&s;&s;ible make me, that of becoming Friends, in&s;tead of Enemies, to their Country.</HI></P></Q>
<P>And then the Lord Chancellor, by his Maje&s;ty's Command, &s;aid:</P>
<Q><P>My Lords and Gentlemen,</P>
<P><HI>IT is His Maje&s;ty's Royal Will and Plea&s;ure, That this Parliament be prorogued to</HI> Monday <HI>the Twelfth Day of</HI> Augu&s;t <HI>next, to be then here held; and this Parliament is accordingly prorogued to</HI> Monday <HI>the Twelfth Day of</HI> Augu&s;t <HI>next.</HI></P></Q>
<P>The Parliament being now gone home, and the Act of Grace pa&s;s'd, the Pri&s;on Doors were every where open'd, and the Mi&s;erable obtain'd their Freedom in every Place; the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> &s;et open her Gates to upwards of 200, the Remains of the Rout at <HI>Pre&s;ton;</HI> &s;ome of whom were reduced &s;o low by the Mi&s;ery of their Circum&s;tances, that they were not able to &s;tand on their Feet, or to take the Benefit of the Liberty that was offer'd.</P>

<P>_THE Pacifick Entrance into this Year, promi&s;ed fair for a happy Conclu&s;ion of it; and had it not been for Factions and Divi&s;ions at Court, the King had &s;een his Reign flouri&s;hing and calm, with all the Pro&s;pects of a &s;ettled Peace that his Heart could de&s;ire. The Judicial Proceedings again&s;t the Remains of the Rebel|lion, were all clo&s;ed by the Act of Grace, of which mention has been made: The Judges (&s;ays
<PB N="141" REF="406">
a certain Author,) now upon their Circuits, are em|ployed rather in the plea&s;ant Part of the Law, <HI>viz.</HI> of receiving the Plea of &s;uch who have laid hold of the King's general Pardon, than that more un&s;a|tisfying Work of pa&s;&s;ing Sentence upon the Per&s;ons found Guilty.</P>
<P>The chief, if not the only Thing which was now upon the Stage on the Head of the late Troubles, was the Proceeding of the Commi&s;&s;ioners for for|feited E&s;tates, <HI>&s;o they were call'd,</HI> of whom menti|on was made, in the preceding Part, and who had now &s;eparated them&s;elves, to act in Vertue of their Tru&s;t, &s;ome in <HI>Scotland</HI> and &s;ome in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e who &s;at in <HI>Scotland</HI> had met with great, and to them, in&s;upportable Difficulties; not &s;o much from the Proprietors of the E&s;tates which were forfeited, for they were mo&s;t of them out of the Capacity of offering any Ob&s;truction to them, but the Oppo&s;ition was from the Creditors of the At|tainted Per&s;ons, who proceeding in the ordinary Cour&s;e of Ju&s;tice, and by the Authority of the Law, had actual Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the E&s;tates in the Right of their Regi&s;tred Bonds and Specialties, and refu&s;ed to pay in the Rents which they received, into the Exchequer.</P>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners applied by a Petition, which is the u&s;ual Form, to the Lords of the Se&s;&s;ion, who are the Bench of Civil Judges in <HI>Scotland.</HI> The Sum of the &s;aid Petition is concluded thus: <HI>May it therefore plea&s;e your Lord&s;hips to recal the Factors, formerly granted by your Lord&s;hips, upon the &s;aid Forfeited E&s;tates, leaving the Care thereof to the Commi&s;&s;ioners of Inquiry, according to the Intent and Meaning of the Act of Parliament?</HI> Upon this Petition, their Lord&s;hips, after many Debates, gave it for the Creditors: So that the Commi&s;&s;ioners had
<PB N="142" REF="407">
had no other Remedy but to lay it before the Parlia|ment to be redre&s;s'd there; but it had not all the Succe&s;s, <HI>even there,</HI> that was expected.</P>
<P>I know the more curious Readers will be very well plea&s;ed to know how the Creditors came to carry their Point &s;o effectually again&s;t the Commi&s;|&s;ioners in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and what were the Arguments which were &s;o clear, and &s;o convincing, that the whole Bench of Judges gave it again&s;t the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners; for which Rea&s;on we have here given the Plea of the Creditors at large, as delivered into the Lords of the Se&s;&s;ion, by way of An&s;wer to the Petition abovementioned: In which celebrated Piece the Reader will &s;ee the whole State of their Ca&s;e, and upon what Foundation they obtained the Sentence of the SESSION, or Court of Civil Ju&s;tice there, to keep the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion even before the King him&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer on the Behalf of Claimants or Creditors to the &s;aid Bill or Petition.</HI></P>
<P>HIS Maje&s;ty's Advocate and Sollicitor having been plea&s;ed to give in a Petition to your Lord&s;hips, for removing the Factors lately appointed for the Management of certain forfeited E&s;tates, now ve&s;ted in His Maje&s;ty by a late Act of Parlia|ment; which Factors were Authorized by your Lord&s;hips, upon the Application of the Creditors on the &s;aid E&s;tates, according to the ordinary Form of our Procedure in &s;uch Ca&s;es; the &s;aid Creditors be|ing ju&s;tly apprehen&s;ive of the Prejudice that may ari&s;e to them in Ca&s;e of any alteration in the Ma|nagement, and in bringing of the Rents of the &s;aid E&s;tates: Do humbly pre&s;ume to lay before your Lord&s;hips the Rea&s;ons why they conceive that any
<PB N="143" REF="408">
Change in that Matter, will not only be highly prejudicial to them, but likewi&s;e of great Di&s;ad|vantage to the Crown; and that the continuing the pre&s;ent Management by your Lord&s;hip's Factors, is no ways incon&s;i&s;tent with the late Act of Parlia|ment appointing Commi&s;&s;ioners to Enquire into the forfeited E&s;tates, nor tends in any &s;ort to incroach upon the Powers wherewith the&s;e Commi&s;&s;ioners are ve&s;ted.</P>
<P>The Creditors at the &s;ame time cannot but be under &s;ome Concern, that they are nece&s;&s;itate to &s;tate them&s;elves in Oppo&s;ition to a Demand made for the Intere&s;t of the Crown, to who&s;e Ju&s;tice and Favour they owe the Security that has been lately given them by Act of Parliament; but they hope, when they plead only in &s;upport of their ju&s;t Debts in Con&s;equence of that Act, they will not be under&s;tood to do any thing unbecoming that Duty and Gratitude they owe to his Maje&s;ty and the Par|liament.</P>
<P>The Declaration for &s;aving the Creditors Rights from any prejudice by the Forfeiture of their Deb|tors, is contain'd in the Act of Parliament, <HI>Primo Georgij,</HI> Intituled, <HI>An Act for Encouraging all Su|periors and Va&s;&s;als,</HI> &amp;c. whereby it is provided, <Q>&startq;That no Convictions or Attainder, upon the Ac|count of the High-Trea&s;on or Trea&s;ons mentioned in the &s;aid Act, &s;hall hurt or exclude the Right or Diligence of any Creditor remaining Peaceable and Dutiful, for &s;ecurity or payment of any true, ju&s;t and lawful Debts, contracted before the Com|mi&s;&s;ion&endq; of any &s;uch Crimes.</Q></P>
<P>The Creditors do, with the greate&s;t Cheerfulne&s;s, rely upon the publick Faith, and make no que&s;tion but that all effectual Methods will be taken for &s;a|tisfying their ju&s;t Claim; and in order to con&s;titute
<PB N="144" REF="409">
the &s;ame; and carry on &s;uch Diligence as the Law requires, for compleating and &s;ecuring their &s;everal Rights, they did make Application to your Lord|&s;hips for Seque&s;trating the &s;aid E&s;tates: That in the mean time, the Rents might be managed by your Lord&s;hips Direction, for the common Benefit of all Per&s;ons claiming Intere&s;ts, as your Lord&s;hips are accu&s;tomed to do in all &s;uch Ca&s;es, where there are many competing for the &s;ame Subject; and this Method of Seque&s;tration is a known Cour&s;e of Di|ligence by the Law of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and what every Creditor has a Right to Demand, as a Common Se|curity for all Parties concern'd: And the Nature of this Diligence by Seque&s;tration, is an effectual Seiz|ing the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the E&s;tates, Goods, and Chat|tels of the Debitors, for payment and &s;atisfaction of their Debts, which therefore mu&s;t continue till that End be obtained, otherwi&s;e it cannot be &s;aid, that the Diligence of Creditors are pre&s;erved to them according to the true Meaning and Intent of the above Clau&s;e, in the Act in Favour of the Creditors.</P>
<P>And here it may not be improper to ob&s;erve to your Lord&s;hips, That according to the Laws and Con&s;titutions of <HI>Scotland,</HI> it was the private Right of Creditors upon Forfeited E&s;tates as well as others, to have their Debtors E&s;tates put under Se|que&s;tration; for which End, they were always in u&s;e to apply to your Lord&s;hips, which never was looked upon as any Incroachment upon the Right of the Crown: And 'tis certain, that the Court of Se&s;&s;ion was the only Court competent to Cogno&s;ce and Determine in all &s;uch Matters. <Q>And by the <HI>18th</HI> Article of the Treaty of Union it is Provided, &startq;That no Alteration be made in the Laws which concern private Rights, except for evident Utility
<PB N="145" REF="410">
&endq;of the Subjects within <HI>Scotland.</HI></Q> <Q>And farther by the <HI>19th</HI> Article, &startq;That the Court of Se&s;&s;ion, after the Union, and notwith&s;tanding there Remain in all time coming within <HI>Scotland,</HI> as it is now con|&s;titute by the Laws of that Kingdom, and with the &s;ame Authorities and Privileges as before the&endq; Union.</Q> From whence the Creditors hope they may ju&s;tly infer, that if any Alteration, with Re|gard to the private Right of the Subjects of <HI>Scot|land</HI> had been intended, it would have been done in the mo&s;t direct and po&s;itive Manner, and can very little be expected to be found in &s;uch Acts of Par|liament as take notice of private Rights, in no other view, than in order to Ratify and Confirm them, and to declare they &s;hall be in no manner Hurt or Excluded by any thing contained in the &s;aid Acts; which is the Ca&s;e of the <HI>Act for Encou|raging Superiors and Va&s;&s;als,</HI> &amp;c. as likewi&s;e of the other <HI>Act appointing Commi&s;&s;ioners to Enquire into the E&s;tates of certain Traytors:</HI> <Q>Which la&s;t Act, le&s;t it &s;hould be under&s;tood any ways to impair or dimini&s;h any of the Advantages or Privileges given to Superiors, Va&s;&s;als, Creditors, or others by the &s;ore&s;aid fir&s;t Act, contains a &s;aving Clau&s;e, whereby it is Enacted, &startq;That nothing in the &s;ame &s;hall Ex|tend, or be con&s;trued to Extend to Take away, Alter, or Dimini&s;h, any Right, Title, Benefit, or Advantage what&s;oever, which any Superior, Va&s;|&s;al, Landlord, or Tenant, or any Creditor or o|thers continuing Peaceable, and in dutiful Alle|giance to His Maje&s;ty, are, &s;hall, or may be Enti|tled unto, in vertue of the fir&s;t cited Act, or to Repeal, Alter, or make Void, any Provi&s;ions, Matters, or Things in that Act contained; any thing in the Act (appointing Commi&s;&s;ioners) to the&endq; contrary notwith&s;tanding.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="411">
And when the Tenor of this Clau&s;e is con&s;ider'd, with the Amplene&s;s and Exten&s;ivene&s;s of the Terms with which every Privilege given to Cre|ditors by the fir&s;t Act, is pre&s;erved in the &s;econd, there can be little Rea&s;on to doubt, but that the Enquire Act leaves the Rights and Diligences of the Creditors upon the &s;ame Foot, as if the &s;aid Act had never been made. So that unle&s;s the fir&s;t Act for encouraging Superiors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> be found in|&s;ufficient for &s;ecuring the Rights and Diligences of Creditors, notwith&s;tanding of the expre&s;s and po&s;i|tive Declaration for that Purpo&s;e, the &s;econd Act can have no Influence, which neither gives nor takes away any Privileges with Regard to the Cre|ditors, but only ratifies whatever Privileges they had a Right to by the &s;aid fir&s;t Act.</P>
<P>In the Petition they do acknowledge the Bene|fit given to Creditors by the afore&s;aid Act, for encouraging Superiors and Va&s;&s;als, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And that the Rights and Diligences of all Creditors remain|ing peaceable and dutiful, are pre&s;erv'd for any Prejudice that may ari&s;e from any Conviction or Attainder upon the Account of the High Trea&s;on of their Debitors, but does alledge, that as to the Inbringing and Receiving the Rents of the &s;aid for|feit E&s;tates, a particular Method is appointed by the other Act in the &s;ame Year of his Maje&s;ty's Reign, Intituled, <HI>An Act for appointing Commi&s;|&s;ioners to enquire into the E&s;tates of certain Tray|tors;</HI> by a Clau&s;e of which Act (recited at large in the Petition) the Right and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the &s;aid forfeit E&s;tates are ve&s;ted in the Per&s;on of his Maje&s;ty; and all the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of &s;uch E|&s;tates are appointed to pay in the Rents thereof to the Exchequer, after previous Notice given to the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ioners of the particular Quantity and
<PB N="147" REF="412">
Quality of the &s;aid E&s;tates, and the Yearly Rents and Values thereof; from whence they are plea&s;ed to infer, that the Seque&s;trations appointed by your Lord&s;hips mu&s;t cea&s;e, and your Lord&s;hips Facto|ries be recalled, leaving the Care of the&s;e E&s;tates to the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ioners of Enquiry, according to the Meaning and Intent of the &s;aid Act for bring|ing in the Rents to the Exchequer, in the Method the &s;aid Act pre&s;cribes.</P>
<P>The Creditors with great Submi&s;&s;ion think, that there is no Incon&s;i&s;tency in the continuance of your Lord&s;hips Factories, notwith&s;tanding of what the &s;aid Act provides, either as to the Inbringing of the &s;aid Rents to the Exchequer, or for di&s;covering the true Value and Extent of them; and they crave Liberty to ob&s;erve, that his Maje&s;ty's Advocate and Sollicitor &s;eems not to Notice, that the Act does not &s;imply appoint the Rents to be paid into the Exchequer; <Q>but the Clau&s;e runs with an alter|native in the&s;e Words, &startq;and &s;hall yield and pay into the Receipt of the Exchequer of <HI>Scotland,</HI> all and every the Rents payable, and of the &s;aid E&s;tates, or otherwi&s;e account for the Profits of the &s;ame, during the Time of their Occupation, from the &s;aid 24th of <HI>June</HI> 1715, until the Sale or Sales &s;o to be made thereof.&endq;</Q> Whereby it appears, there is no ab&s;olute Order for paying the Rents into the Exchequer; but where a Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or has ju&s;t Rea&s;ons, either for retaining the whole Rents, or any Part of them, which may happen in many Ca&s;es, according to the various Circum|&s;tances of the Rights of &s;uch Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, there is no Obligation lies, &s;ave only to Account during the Time of their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which does &s;ufficiently an|&s;wer the De&s;ign of the Law, which here appears to be, to di&s;cover the full Extent and Value of the

&s;aid E&s;tates, and in who&s;e Hands the &s;ame are, to the End that &s;uch Per&s;ons may afterwards be made liable for their Intromi&s;&s;ions; but there appears nothing in the &s;aid Clau&s;e, and indeed, in no part of the Act, that points at the turning any Man out of his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; the Act only declaring all Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors to be accountable to the Publick: At the making of which Accounts, the Titles of the re|&s;pective Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors will fall to be Examined, and if found in&s;ufficient, can only then be &s;et a&s;ide; &s;o that tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s by your Lord&s;hips Authority, as Factors, are in no different Ca&s;e from any other Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, and &s;tand accountable, as all other Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ors do, to the Publick, in the manner the Act of Enquiry has appointed; and are in the common Ca&s;e with others, obliged to give Notice of their being in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and of the Value and Yearly Rent of their Intromi&s;&s;ions; which is all that the Act does require.</P>
<P>By which your Lord&s;hips will ea&s;ily perceive, that neither the making the &s;aid Rents payable unto the Exchequer, nor the declaring all Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors ac|countable for their Intromi&s;&s;ions, can afford any Ar|gument for removing of your Lord&s;hips Factors, as if there were any Incon&s;i&s;tency in their continuing in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, any more than any other Per&s;on; for they are accountable in the &s;ame manner as tho&s;e mu&s;t be, who may be put in their Places; and the Act plainly requires nothing farther, than that all Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors in general &s;hall be an&s;werable for their Intromi&s;&s;ions, without giving any Directions or Pow|ers to the Commi&s;&s;ioners of Enquiry, for making choice of particular Per&s;ons for the Management of the &s;aid E&s;tates.</P>
<P>It will ea&s;ily appear to your Lord&s;hips, That the Orders for paying in the Rents to the Exchequer,
<PB N="149" REF="414">
could not have been made Ab&s;olute, but mu&s;t have had the Alternative for Accounting; for if all Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ors had been without Di&s;tirction ordained to pay|ing, the Act for encouraging Superiors and Va&s;|&s;als, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> could not have taken Effect, which never|thele&s;s is Ratified by the Act of Enquiry; for Supe|riors remaining dutiful, could not be &s;aid to have had the Benefit of their rebellious Va&s;&s;als Forfeitures, if they were in&s;tantly to advance and pay the&s;e Rents into the Exchequer; and no more could Landlords have the Benefit of the Tacks of Lea&s;es, which the Law makes void in ca&s;e of the Tack&s;mens Rebelli|on; neither could the Tenants retain the Two Years Rents, and continue free of Payment of any Duty, if whatever belonged to the Rebels, without Di|&s;tinction, were to be paid into the Exchequer; which makes it obvious, That the Alternative was ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to prevent the excluding any Man's Right, until it were Judged and Cogno&s;ced upon in a legal Way.</P>
<P>Neither does the Clau&s;e ve&s;ting the Right and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;aid forfeit E&s;tates in the Per&s;on of his Maje&s;ty; nor that other Clau&s;e, appointing the Commi&s;&s;ioners to take in all Claims upon the &s;aid E&s;tates, to the End the &s;aid Claims may be deter|mined by &s;uch Acts of Parliament as &s;hall afterwards be made, much contribute to make out that Incon|&s;i&s;tency which his Maje&s;ty's Advocate and Sollici|tor pretends there is in your Lord&s;hips Factors con|tinuing their Management; for as to the &s;aid E&s;tates being ve&s;ted in his Maje&s;ty, that mu&s;t be under&s;tood to be in the &s;ame manner as they were in the Per&s;on of the Rebels, and con&s;equently with the Burthen of the Debts and Diligences, chargeable upon the &s;aid E&s;tates, which are pre&s;erved in the mo&s;t exten|&s;ive manner, by the two above cited Acts of Par|liament;

<P>The Creditors mu&s;t beg Liberty here to ob&s;erve, the great Damage that mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;e both to them and to the Publick, in ca&s;e any &s;top &s;hould be put to your Lord&s;hips Factors, who as your Lord&s;hips know, are tied to many Regulations in their Management and manner of Compting, that the other Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors or Factors will not be &s;ubject to; as particular, they are liable for the Intere&s;t of the Rents in their Hands after a certain time, which takes away a great Temptation others will have to delay the making of their Accounts: They are (be&s;ides &s;everal other Re&s;traints put upon them) expre&s;ly made incapable to purcha&s;e any of the Cre|ditors Rights upon the E&s;tate they have in Manage|ment; which Practice, before it was Di&s;charged by your Lord&s;hips by a particular Act of <HI>Sederant,</HI> was of mo&s;t pernicious Con&s;equence to the Intere&s;t of the Creditors; and it's too much to be feared, may be u&s;ed by &s;uch as are not legally debarred from it, to the Ruin of many poor nece&s;&s;itous People, who&s;e Circum&s;tance mu&s;t force them to enter into any

Tran&s;actions for their pre&s;ent Relief, though never &s;o di&s;advantageous.</P>
<P>Another Con&s;equence of the Removal of your Lord&s;hips Factors, will, in all appearance, be, that tho&s;e who had the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion before the Seque&s;tra|tion, will re-a&s;&s;ume their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion again, and in&s;i&s;t upon their being only liable to Account as Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, according as the Act of Parliament does appoint; and tho' new Factors &s;hould be named by the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners of Enquiry, yet it is &s;o probable, the Tenants and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the &s;aid E&s;tates may de|cline to pay to the&s;e Factors, upon pretence that they have a Right to Compt immediately with the Publick; or may, perhaps, in&s;i&s;t upon the &s;aid Fa|ctors Di&s;charge to them not being &s;ufficient to acquit them in Law, &s;ince there is not any direct or expre&s;s Power given to the Commi&s;&s;ioners of Enquiry for naming &s;uch Factors; which Difficulties, as they will not ea&s;ily be removed without Proce&s;&s;es at Law, &s;o, during &s;uch Di&s;putes, 'tis but too certain the Subject mu&s;t peri&s;h, to the Prejudice both of the Crown and the Creditors.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty's Advocate and Sollicitor &s;eems to acknowledge the Nece&s;&s;ity there was from the then &s;ituation of Affairs, for your Lord&s;hips interpo&s;ing and appointing the Method of managing of the &s;aid E&s;tates; but does alledge, that now that the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners are in the Exerci&s;e of their Tru&s;t, and with the Exchequer have &s;pecial Powers for the Pre|&s;ervation and Ingathering of the&s;e Rents, the Clau&s;e of your Lord&s;hips granting the Factories has now cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>If his Maje&s;ty's Advocate and Sollicitor had ap|pointed out the &s;pecial Powers given the Commi&s;|&s;ioners for ordering the Collecting and Ingathering of the &s;aid Rent, the Creditors &s;hould have been

le&s;s &s;elicitous by whom the Factories had been granted. But it is not a&s;&s;erted in any part of the Petition, that there is any expre&s;s Clau&s;e in the afore&s;aid Act, naming the Management to be only by &s;uch Per&s;ons as &s;hould be appointed by the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners; the Petition only in&s;inuating it as a Mat|ter of Expediency, that the Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould have that Power for the better Executing of their Office, which the Creditors cannot but take as an Acknowledgment, that at lea&s;t the Commi&s;&s;ioners Powers, as to that particular, is doubtful; and &s;o long as it remains &s;o, your Lord&s;hips will be &s;atis|fied how great an Inconveniency would follow in ca&s;e of removing tho&s;e Factors already in the Ma|nagement, when tho&s;e to be put in their Places will be liable to &s;uch Exception, as cannot but occa&s;ion the greate&s;t Confu&s;ion, as has been already noticed.</P>
<P>As to the Argument the Petition makes from the Power of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of Enquiry, as to the di&s;po&s;ing of the per&s;onal Goods and Chattels of the Rebels, that it ought to be equally exten&s;ive with regard to the real E&s;tate; your Lord&s;hips will ob|&s;erve, that the Rea&s;on of committing the Goods and Chattels to the Commi&s;&s;ioners Charge, which the Act takes notices of, was for preventing the Prie&s;ting of &s;uch Goods, or any Lo&s;s or Embezzlement that might happen; which was not to be feared, as to the Rents of the real E&s;tates for which the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors are an&s;werable, and which &s;eems to be a good Rea|&s;on why the Law has not thought fit to commit the &s;ecuring of tho&s;e likewi&s;e to the Commi&s;&s;ioners Charge.</P>
<P>The Petition takes notices, that the &s;aid Factors were appointed by your Lord&s;hips upon the Appli|cation of the Creditors, and the Security taken be|ing only in view of their Intere&s;t, without regard
<PB N="153" REF="418">
to the Concern the Publick had in the&s;e E&s;tates; there was no Rea&s;on for the Publick to acquie&s;ce, or think &s;o great Sums as may happen to come to the Hands of the&s;e Factors, to be &s;afely lodged as to this Point; 'tis humbly thought there will be little Rea&s;on to doubt of the &s;ufficiency of the Security with regard to the Creditors Debts only, but accor|dingly to the value of the Subject to be intromitted with; and no doubt, whatever the Publick can pro|po&s;e for making the Security unexceptionable, will be gone into by your Lord&s;hips, and will be very acceptable to the Creditors; but even the altering any of the Factors upon the Account of any Obje|ctions again&s;t the &s;ufficiency of their Security, will not take off the Seque&s;tration it &s;elf, which &s;tands upon the &s;ort of a Judicial Sentence of your Lord|&s;hips, and &s;o cannot be removed, but according to the Form and Procedure of the Court, by an Action of Reduction; &s;o that upon the whole, it mu&s;t cer|tainly be acknowledged, that no Method of Ma|nagement can be &s;uppo&s;ed to be more advantageous in all Re&s;pects, both for the Intere&s;t of the Crown, that of the Creditors, and all others concerned, than the pre&s;ent, under your Lord&s;hips Direction, which the Creditors humbly hope will not be alter'd.</P>

The fir&s;t Parliament Bu&s;ine&s;s we meet with this Year, is in <HI>Ireland,</HI> where the Duke of <HI>Bolton</HI> being Lord Lieutenant, the Parliament &s;et down the <HI>27th,</HI> when the new Peers who were Created as above, being Introduc'd, the Duke open'd the Se&s;&s;ion with the following Speech.</P>
<Q><P>My Lords and Gentlemen,</P>
<P><HI>HIS Maje&s;ty has commanded me to acquaint you, That it is to His great Satisfaction, your pre|&s;ent Meeting in Parliament is in a Time of publick Peace and Tranquillity, and after the entire Sup|pre&s;&s;ion of the late unnatural Rebellion, which your &s;ea&s;onable Loyalty and Zeal, not only kept out of this Kingdom, but contributed likewi&s;e to extingui&s;h in</HI> Great Britain. <HI>As the Mi&s;eries this Nation hath heretofore experienced from a Popi&s;h Government, could not but animate you to di&s;tingui&s;h your &s;elves on that Occa&s;ion, you may be a&s;&s;ured that His Maje&s;ty will make &s;uitable Returns to &s;uch In&s;tances of your Duty and Affection, by &s;upporting and maintaining you in the full and free Enjoyment of all your Reli|gious and Civil Rights.</HI></P></Q>
<Q><P>Gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Commons,</P>
<P><HI>Your vigorous Re&s;olutions, added to your Vote of Credit in the late critical Juncture, were &s;o accepta|ble to his Maje&s;ty, that tho' He has, by His Act of Grace, Pardoned tho&s;e who were ingaged in the late Rebellion, he will always remember the Loyal and Affectionate Endeavours of &s;uch who were &s;o active to defeat it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>You mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that the Charge occa&s;ion'd by tho&s;e Di&s;turbances, has con&s;iderably augmented the National Debt, which has been chiefly incurred &s;ince that time; an exact and ju&s;t Account of which,</HI>
<PB N="157" REF="422">
<HI>and of what it con&s;i&s;ts, &s;hall be laid before you. And I am to acquaint you, that His Maje&s;ty, to prevent its Increa&s;e, has given Orders for &s;uch Reductions in the Military Li&s;t, as He thinks may be con&s;i&s;tent with your pre&s;ent Security, and has put the new E&s;tabli&s;hment into &s;uch a Form, as will &s;hew you the real Number of effective Men you have to depend on. His Maje&s;ty has likewi&s;e thought fit to le&s;&s;en the Civil Li&s;t on the Head of Pen&s;ions, and has di|rected &s;uch Rules to be ob&s;erved, as may annually abate the Expence upon them: But as the yearly Charge of the E&s;tabli&s;hment exceeds the annual Pro|duce of the Revenue, His Maje&s;ty doubts not to have &s;uch Aids and Supplies granted him, as will &s;up|port the E&s;tabli&s;hment and di&s;charge the Debt; and that you will agree on the Means of doing it with the &s;ame Unanimity, as you did when it was nece&s;&s;a|ry to contract it.</HI></P></Q>
<P>My Lords and Gentlemen,</P>
<P><HI>I think my &s;elf obliged to take Notice to you, of His Maje&s;ty's great Goodne&s;s, in having lately pa&s;&s;ed an Act in the Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain, <HI>for the Encouragement of the Linen Manufacture in this Kingdom. And am commanded by his Maje&s;ty to recommend to you, in a very particular Manner, Unanimity and Agreement among&s;t your &s;elves in all your Proceedings, which His Maje&s;ty conceives mu&s;t be of the utmo&s;t Importance to His Service, and your own Security, in a Country where there is &s;o great a Di&s;proportion between the Friends and Enemies of our Religion, Laws and Liberties.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I cannot conclude, without expre&s;&s;ing the Satisfacti|on I have, in His Maje&s;ty's &s;ending me again to a Kingdom, where I had formerly the Honour to &s;erve the late King</HI> William <HI>of Glorious Memory, as one of</HI>

<HI>the Lords Ju&s;tices, and where I then received &s;o many In&s;tances of your good Will towards me. I &s;hall endeavour &s;till to pre&s;erve your Affections, by repre|&s;enting your Actions in a ju&s;t and true Light to His Maje&s;ty, and by doing every thing in my Power, that may conduce to the publick Good.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Commons were gone back to their Hou&s;e, and their Speaker had reported the Speech, they unanimou&s;ly Voted an Addre&s;s of Thanks to the Lord Lieutenant for his Speech, and the Lords did the like in their Hou&s;e; The&s;e Addre&s;&s;es being as well to the King as to the Lord Lieutenant, and being only Things of Cour&s;e, con&s;i&s;ting of Compli|ments to the Lord Lieutenant, and A&s;&s;urances of Duty and Loyalty to the King, I omit, as too long to take Place here.</P>
<P>This Parliament, to give them their due, pa&s;s'd a great many excellent Laws for the Improvement, Advantage and Security, as well of Religion as of Commerce, Planting, Manufacturing in the King|dom, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Al&s;o they revived a great many expiring Laws, of all which I &s;hall &s;peak in their Place.</P>
<P>But with the&s;e good Things, they forgot not beginning where they left off, <HI>viz.</HI> in the pro&s;ecu|ting the Offenders of the former Times: And tho' the King had &s;hewn them an Example of Clemency, in publi&s;hing an Act of Grace for the Ea&s;e of his People, they did not think fit to let the Example be &s;ufficient to recommend it&s;elf to them, in the Ca&s;e which at that Time was before them; nay, as a Wri|ter of that Time publi&s;hed, &s;o vindictive was the Temper reigning at that Time, that they took &s;o little Notice of the Pattern &s;et by his Maje&s;ty, that they even refu&s;ed to accept the Penitence of a Gentleman of their own Hou&s;e, who humbly ac|knowledged
<PB N="159" REF="424">
his Offence, declared him&s;elf to be hear|tily &s;orry for it, and begg'd Pardon of the Hou&s;e, or at lea&s;t was ready to do &s;o; but when it came to the Que&s;tion in the Hou&s;e, Whether his humble Ac|knowledgment &s;hould be accepted by the Hou&s;e? it pa&s;s'd in the <HI>Negative;</HI> and they order'd him to be expelled the Hou&s;e; and yet this great Crime was much le&s;s than tho&s;e forgiven by his Maje&s;ty, for it was neither Trea&s;on, or Rebellion; only that it &s;eems he had &s;igned an Addre&s;s to the late Queen from the County of <HI>Lowth,</HI> in Oppo&s;ition to an Addre&s;s of the late Hou&s;e of Commons.</P>
<P>For this capital Offence, tho' abundance of Gen|tlemen has been excu&s;ed the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion upon their Submi&s;&s;ion, and others had been cen&s;ur'd, the Re|&s;entment was not thereby allay'd; but on the <HI>9th</HI> of <HI>September,</HI> or thereabout, they call'd upon one <HI>John Leigh,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> for &s;igning the Addre&s;s from the Coun|ty of <HI>Lowth</HI> in the late Queen's Time, and the Ad|dre&s;s being read, they order'd that Mr. <HI>Leigh</HI> be now called upon in his Place, to give an Account of his Rea&s;ons for &s;igning the &s;aid Addre&s;s; which be|ing done, Mr. <HI>Leigh</HI> &s;tood up in his Place, confe&s;&s;ed he had &s;ign'd the &s;aid Addre&s;s, that he was heartily &s;orry for his Fault, and humbly begg'd Pardon of the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Upon this the Que&s;tion was put, That the Sub|mi&s;&s;ion of Mr. <HI>Leigh</HI> be accepted as a Satisfaction to the Hou&s;e; and a Debate ari&s;ing upon it, the Debate was put off to that Day Sevennight, when being called again, and the Debate revived, it pa&s;|&s;ed in the Negative, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Submi&s;&s;ion &s;hould not be accepted, and thereupon Mr. <HI>Leigh</HI> was expelled the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="425">
In this Manner the Hou&s;e went on, not omitting, however, the publick Bu&s;ine&s;s; all the Supplies the King demanded they readily came into, and made effectual Provi&s;ions for: Likewi&s;e they recom|mended &s;everal Sufferers in the former Reign to the Government for Relief and Rewards; &s;o that they exercis'd &s;ome Charity as well as Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>There was indeed one Thing moved in the Par|liament, which we &s;hall only touch here, hoping to hear more of it, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Archbi&s;hop of&mdash;, moved in the Hou&s;e of Peers, that for the Honour of Religion, and for propagating the Reformation in <HI>Ireland,</HI> he was willing to dive&s;t him&s;elf of a con&s;iderable Part of the Revenues of his Bi&s;hoprick, to augment the Stipends and Income of poor Livings in the Country, and for the Encou|ragement of the inferior Clergy to do their Duty; that their Maintenance may be &s;ufficient to &s;upport them in the Di&s;charge of their Duty. We find lit|tle Notice taken of this Piece of Chri&s;tian Genero|&s;ity; but we &s;hall not fail to Record it, and give due Acknowledgments to it, that Po&s;terity may &s;ee there have been &s;ome among us, in this Age of the Church's Degeneracy, who have yet been moved with a Spirit of true Chri&s;tianity, and a di&s;intere&s;ted Zeal for the Prote&s;tant Religion, and the Reforma|tion, even in <HI>Ireland</HI> it &s;elf: We do not hear yet what Encouragement &s;uch a pious Propo&s;al has met with; we know it was at fir&s;t &s;econded by very few; but there is Hope yet that it may revive.</P>
<P>Tho' 'tis &s;ome Interruption to the Story of the Parliament, yet I cannot omit here, that 'tis to an Accident in this Year, that we &s;ay the Ri&s;e of the formidable Body of Pirates is owing, who to this Day infe&s;t our Commerce and Colonies in <HI>America,</HI> commonly call'd the <HI>We&s;t-Indies;</HI> the be&s;t Ac|count
<PB N="161" REF="426">
I meet with of this Affair, is as fol|lows,</P>
<P>To begin at the beginning of it, we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, That &s;undry Cau&s;es are a&s;&s;ign'd to this Evil, but principally this, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Spaniards</HI> in <HI>America</HI> are very chary of their Commerce, that is to &s;ay, to prevent our Sloops and Brigantines appearing upon their Coa&s;t from <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and other Places, to car|ry on a private Trade there; and two or three <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI> Men of War plied &s;o diligently upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Cartagena</HI> and St. <HI>Martha,</HI> that our Sloops could not Trade there without great Danger, and one or two were taken: This &s;o exa&s;perated our <HI>Jamaica</HI> Traders, that taking a &s;ufficient Force with them, they re&s;olved upon a private Expedition, to be re|veng'd of the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>Accordingly two Ships and three Sloops were fitted out, &s;ome from <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> others from St. <HI>Chri&s;tophers,</HI> but Mann'd among the Adventu|rers, as they call them, or at lea&s;t Mann'd with &s;ome of them; the&s;e are they we call <HI>Campeachy</HI> Men, but who are indeed no better or wor&s;e than <HI>Buccaneers;</HI> that is, Fellows ready for any Adven|ture, to Rob or Plunder any one they could fall up|on. The&s;e Ve&s;&s;els being joined, go away to the Gulph of <HI>Florida,</HI> where the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Galleons or Plate Fleet, had, two Years before, been Wreck'd and ca&s;t away, and where they were at Work with &s;everal Ve&s;&s;els from the <HI>Havana,</HI> with divers En|gines, to Fi&s;h up the Silver that was on Board the Galleons.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> had recover'd &s;everal Millions of Pieces of Eight, and had carried it all to the <HI>Hava|na;</HI> but they had at pre&s;ent about 350000 Pieces of Eight in Silver then upon the Spot, and were daily taking up more. This Money was left on Shore,
<PB N="162" REF="427">
the Men in the Ve&s;&s;els &s;ending on Shore every Night what they Fi&s;hed up in the Day; and there it was depo&s;ited in a Store-hou&s;e, under the Government of two Commi&s;&s;aries, and a Guard of about Sixty Soldiers.</P>
<P>Our Rovers come directly to the Spot, bring their little Fleet to an Anchor, and, in a Word, landing Three Hundred Men, they attack'd the Guard, who immediately run away, and thus they &s;eized the Trea&s;ure, which they carried away, making the be&s;t of their way to <HI>Jamaica.</HI></P>
<P>In their way they unhappily met with a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ship, bound from <HI>Porto Bello</HI> to the <HI>Havana,</HI> with a great many rich Goods, <HI>viz.</HI> Bales of <HI>Cochineal,</HI> Casks of <HI>Indico,</HI> and 60000 Pieces of Eight more, which their Hands being in, they took al&s;o, and ha|ving rifled the Ve&s;&s;el, let her go.</P>
<P>They went away to <HI>Jamaica</HI> with their Booty, and were followed thither, that is, in View of the Port, by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who having &s;een them thither, went back to the Governor of the <HI>Havana</HI> with the Account of it, who immediately &s;ent a Ve&s;&s;el to the Governor of <HI>Jamaica</HI> to complain of this Robbery, and to reclaim the Goods.</P>
<P>As it was in full Peace, and contrary to all Ju&s;tice and Right that this Fact was committed, they were &s;oon made &s;en&s;ible that the Government at <HI>Jamaica</HI> would not &s;uffer them to go unpuni&s;hed, much le&s;s protect them: They therefore &s;aw a Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;hifting for them&s;elves, and &s;o to make Bad Wor&s;e, they went to Sea again, tho' not without di&s;po&s;ing their Cargo to good Advantage, and furni&s;hing them|&s;elves with Ammunition, Provi&s;ion, and better Ships, and being thus made De&s;perate, they turn'd Pirates, robbing not the <HI>Spaniards</HI> only, but their own Coun|try-men, and any Nation they could lay their Hands on.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="428">
Add to this, another Misfortune, <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> with Seven or Eight &s;mall Men of War, falling about this Time upon the <HI>Buccaneers,</HI> or <HI>Log|wood-Cutters,</HI> in the Bay of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> and taking all their Ships from them, and forcing the Men to Surrender upon Condition of having their Lives given them, and a Ve&s;&s;el, tho' with no Fire Arms or Ammunition, to carry them Home: The&s;e Men, made de&s;perate, fell in with the re&s;t, and encrea&s;ed their Number.</P>
<P>It would be too long to give an Account here of their Piracies; it may &s;uffice to ob&s;erve, that they took abundance of Ships, and plundered them $always of Three Things, <HI>viz.</HI> Money, Ammuni|tion, and Victuals, and by this Means grew va&s;tly Rich: and, as in &s;uch Ca&s;es it always happens, all the loo&s;e, raki&s;h, de&s;perate Fellows in the I&s;lands, that had nothing to do, or live on, and were bent for Mi&s;chief and Adventures, got toge|ther, and went to them, till at la&s;t growing very &s;trong, they con&s;ulted together about getting &s;ome Retreat, where they might lodge their Wealth, re|pair their Ships, and make them&s;elves a kind of Abode.</P>
<P>They were not long in re&s;olving; but &s;ailing di|rectly to the I&s;le of <HI>Providence,</HI> or <HI>New Providence,</HI> they &s;eiz'd upon it, landed their People, and fell to work to fortify. Here they now reign, and be|ing, as we hear, about Four Thou&s;and Men, and Twenty or Thirty Ve&s;&s;els of all Sorts, they rove about the Sea, &s;couring the Coa&s;ts of our Colonies of <HI>Carolina, Virginia,</HI> nay, up as high as <HI>New-Eng|land,</HI> to the inconceivable Prejudice of Commerce, and Ruin of our People.</P>
<P>The Government having been applied to for Re|lief in this Ca&s;e, have, at the Motion of &s;ome
<PB N="164" REF="429">
People, who know &s;omething of the Di&s;po&s;ition of the&s;e Pirates, fir&s;t taken the gentle Method of of|fering them a Pardon by Proclamation: which Pro|clamation Sir <HI>Nicholas Lawes,</HI> the New Gover|nour of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> who is now going over, is to carry with him; in which al&s;o is included, Re|wards to all tho&s;e who &s;hall &s;eize and apprehend any of them, after the Time for accepting that Pardon is elaps'd. The Proclamation is very par|ticular and worth Recording, and that with the Proclamation may be &s;een the Account the Go|vernment had of them, and the Means u&s;ed for &s;up|pre&s;&s;ing them, we have al&s;o given the Appoint|ment of the Men of War for that Service, and the Mea&s;ures taken for the attacking them, as fol|lows:</P>

<P>And whereas it has al&s;o been repre&s;ented to His Maje&s;ty, that in <HI>March,</HI> 1705-6, the Hou&s;e of Lords did, in an Addre&s;s to Her late Maje&s;ty, <Q>&s;et forth, &startq;That the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> had twice, during that War, over-run and plunder'd the <HI>Bahama</HI> I&s;lands; That there was no Form of Go|vernment there: That the Harbour of the I&s;land of <HI>Providence</HI> might be ea&s;ily put in a Po&s;ture of Defence, and that it would be of dangerous Con&s;equence &s;hould tho&s;e I&s;lands fall into the Hands of an Enemy; wherefore the Lords hum|bly be&s;ought Her Maje&s;ty, to u&s;e &s;uch Methods as &s;he &s;hould think proper, for taking the &s;aid I&s;land into her Hands, in order to &s;ecure the &s;ame to the Crown of this Kingdom, and to the Security and Advantage of the Trade thereof:&endq;</Q> But that there were not any Means u&s;ed, in Com|pliance with that Addre&s;s, for &s;ecuring the &s;aid <HI>Bahama</HI> I&s;lands; and that at this Time the Pi|rates have a Lodgment with a Battery on <HI>Harbour</HI> I&s;land, one of the <HI>Bahamas;</HI> as al&s;o, that the u&s;ual Retreat and general Receptacle for Pirates is at <HI>Pro|vidence,</HI> the principal of tho&s;e I&s;lands: His Ma|je&s;ty has been farther graciou&s;ly pleas'd to give Di|rections for di&s;lodging tho&s;e Pirates who have ta|ken Shelter in the &s;aid I&s;lands, as al&s;o as for &s;ecu|ring tho&s;e I&s;lands, and making Settlements and a

<P>They had the like Di&s;pute before them on Account of the City of <HI>Kilkenny,</HI> in both which Ca&s;es things went with an high hand again&s;t the Proceed|ings in tho&s;e Cities in the late Times, the oppo&s;ite Party were all cen&s;ur'd, and tho&s;e who did not ab&s;cond, were order'd to be taken into Cu&s;tody.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e this <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Parliament did one thing which we very rarely &s;ee done in <HI>England;</HI> this was, that whereas &s;everal Members had been order'd to be ta|ken into Cu&s;tody the Year before, but had ab&s;con|ded till the Se&s;&s;ions was over, believing them&s;elves &s;ecure after the Prorogation, as is the Cu&s;tom here, the Hou&s;e cau&s;ed enquiry to be made after it, and i&s;&s;ued new Orders for taking them into Cu&s;tody now on the former Account; but they al&s;o ab&s;conded again: And as for the Citizens of <HI>Kilkenny,</HI> who they cen&s;ur'd, they order'd a Bill to be brought in to disfranchi&s;e them, <HI>(viz.)</HI> four Aldermen, one Common-Council Man and one Freeman; and for the better regulating the &s;aid Corporation.</P>
<P>They continued &s;itting till the <HI>23d</HI> of <HI>December,</HI> when all Things being arrived from <HI>England,</HI> were
<PB N="170" REF="435">
pa&s;s'd by the Lord Lieutenant, and then they were prorogued.</P>
<P>At their pre&s;enting the Money-Bills, their Spea|ker made a long Speech, and at the conclu&s;ion of all, the Hou&s;es deliver'd very dutiful Addre&s;&s;es to the Lord Lieutenant, to be tran&s;mitted to the King, and thus their long Se&s;&s;ion ended, and we are likely to hear no more of them for a good while, being &s;ince that prorogued to <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1719.</P>
<P>Before I come to the Meeting of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Par|liament, &s;everal material Things occur to be re|corded, of which I &s;hall &s;peak what is nece&s;&s;ary, but as briefly as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The King having re&s;olv'd not to go into <HI>Germany</HI> this la&s;t Summer, re&s;ided at <HI>Hampton-Court</HI> all the Summer Sea&s;on, where his Maje&s;ty drank the Wa|ters of <HI>Pyrmont,</HI> which he had cau&s;ed to be brought over on purpo&s;e, and having fini&s;hed the u&s;ual Cour&s;e of taking the Waters, the King re&s;olved to take a Tour into the Country, and particularly to <HI>New-Market</HI> to &s;ee the Hor&s;e-Races.</P>
<P>The King &s;et out from <HI>Hampton-Court</HI> the <HI>2d,</HI> and tho' he was much &s;topp'd by the tedious pa&s;|&s;ing thro' <HI>Southwark,</HI> over the Bridge, and thro' the City, yet fre&s;h Hor&s;es being laid at &s;hort Stages, they drove thro' in a Day, and the King came thither about Seven a Clock in the Evening.</P>
<P>It would take up too much Room here to enter into the Particulars of the Journey; how the Coun|try People flock'd to &s;ee the King; and what Joy they &s;hew'd on that Occa&s;ion: But his Maje&s;ty's vi&s;iting the Univer&s;ity cannot be omitted. The Vice-Chancellor, Mr. <HI>Gregg,</HI> with the Heads of the Colleges, waited on his Maje&s;ty in Form at <HI>New-Market,</HI> and made their Compliment; to which the King returned the following An&s;wer:</P>
<PB N="171" REF="436">
<Q><P>Mr. Vice-Chancellor,</P>
<P>I <HI>Thank you for the A&s;&s;urance you give me of your Duty and Affection, and the &V;niver&s;ity may al|ways depend on my Favour and Encouragement.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Then they invited his Maje&s;ty to the Univer&s;ity, which was accepted, and accordingly the King went, as we &s;hall &s;ee pre&s;ently. In the mean time, the Gentlemen were very magnificently treated at Din|ner by his Maje&s;ty's &s;pecial Order, and went Home to prepare to do the like to the King.</P>
<P>At <HI>New-Market,</HI> the Sport and the Plea&s;ure of the Country was very much abated, by the violent, and almo&s;t ince&s;&s;ant Rains; but the King was, how|ever, on Hor&s;eback early, hunted a Hare in the Morning, and then came upon the Cour&s;e, and &s;aw the Races.</P>
<P>The next Day his Maje&s;ty din'd at <HI>Chippenham,</HI> a fine new built Seat of the Earl of <HI>Orford</HI>'s, built all new, and which, with the Gardens, it is &s;aid co&s;t his Lord&s;hip Forty Thou&s;and Pieces.</P>
<P>The next Day being <HI>Sunday,</HI> the King went to <HI>Cambridge.</HI> His Reception there, and what pa&s;s'd upon that Occa&s;ion, I &s;hall give in a few Words. His Maje&s;ty was fir&s;t met out of the Town by the Magi&s;trates, or Corporation, according to the U&s;age on &s;uch Occa&s;ions; when the Mayor addre&s;&s;ing him|&s;elf very hand&s;omly to the King, made the Town's Pre&s;ent, which is a Pur&s;e with a certain Number of Pieces of Gold, which it &s;eems they are obliged to, as often as, or perhaps the fir&s;t Time, that the Sovereign comes to the Place.</P>
<P>For the Reception of his Maje&s;ty by the Univer|&s;ity, the Schollars were placed in their Habits, and in the College Order, in a Line on each Street, and
<PB N="172" REF="437">
were ordered to Shout in <HI>Latin</HI> as the King pa&s;&s;ed by, <HI>VIVAT REX:</HI> It is &s;aid they were or|der'd to kneel at the &s;ame time, but the Croud made that impracticable. The Mayor and Corporation came on before his Maje&s;ty in their Formalities bare-headed, and &s;topping at the School, his Ma|je&s;ty was received there with a <HI>Latin</HI> Oration pro|nounced kneeling, by Dr. <HI>Ayloff,</HI> the Univer&s;ity O|rator: After this, his Maje&s;ty entred the Schools, where the Vice-Chancellor Mr. <HI>Gregg,</HI> who till then was not a Graduate, was made Doctor, as al&s;o another, that the King might &s;ee the Manner of the Commencement; after which, the King gave them a Li&s;t of Names, being &s;uch as his Maje&s;ty thought fit to have created Doctors, or of other Degrees.</P>
<P>From hence they went to <HI>King</HI>'s College Chap|pel in the &s;ame Order, where his Maje&s;ty heard Di|vine Service, the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Norwich</HI> turning over the Common Prayer Book, and pointing out the Prayers to the King. After the Sermon, his Ma|je&s;ty went to <HI>Trinity</HI> College; he was received in the College Hall by Dr. <HI>Bentley,</HI> attended by the whole Body of the Fellows and Students: The Doctor made a Speech to his Maje&s;ty, and, after the u&s;ual Ceremony, the King din'd in the Ma&s;ter's, Dr. <HI>Bentley</HI>'s Appartment, the &s;aid Ma&s;ter waiting at Table. In the Evening his Maje&s;ty having been plea&s;ed to let the Univer&s;ity know that he was well plea&s;ed with his Entertainment, and having Knight|ed Mr. <HI>Thomp&s;on</HI> of <HI>Trumpington,</HI> returned to <HI>New-Market,</HI> and the next Day came back to <HI>Hamp|ton Court.</HI></P>
<P>The Names of the &s;everal Graduates advanc'd up|on this Occa&s;ion were as follow:</P>

<P>It was ob&s;ervable, that when the King went thro' the City for <HI>New-Market,</HI> as above, a poor Fellow, by Trade a Weaver, crowding to &s;ee the King in the Street of <HI>White-Chappel,</HI> was thru&s;t down &s;o under the Coach that the King's Coach Wheel wnt over his Leg and broke it: The King call'd out to
<PB N="175" REF="440">
&s;ome of his Servants to order the Man to be taken Care of, which was done, and when the Man was cured, upon Application to his Maje&s;ty by the King's own Surgeon, the King order'd him <HI>50 l.</HI> in Money to pay for the Cure, and a Pen&s;ion of <HI>20 l.</HI> a Year during his Life.</P>
<P>In this Interval of the King's Progre&s;s to <HI>Cambridge,</HI> the Prince&s;s of <HI>Wales</HI> being great with Child, re|moved to St. <HI>James</HI>'s for her lying in, and on the <HI>2d</HI> of <HI>November</HI> &s;he was &s;afely deliver'd of a Prince, which was for a while the occa&s;ion of great Rejoi|cings; but all that &s;oon inverted, and the unhappy Infant was innocently the Original of a melancholy Scene at Court, which is not yet removed.</P>
<P>By this I mean the Breach between the King and the Prince, his Maje&s;ty's only Son, which begin|ning at the Solemnity of the Chri&s;tening of the Prince's Son, ended in bani&s;hing the Prince him&s;elf from the Court, and from the Pre&s;ence and Council of the King his Father, which Breach and Di&s;tance remains &s;o to this Day.</P>
<P>In a few Days after the Prince&s;s was brought to Bed, the Sea&s;on growing extreme Wet, and the &s;itting of the Parliament, or at lea&s;t the Preparati|ons for it, requiring particular Application, his Ma|je&s;ty with the whole Court came to Town.</P>
<P>About the beginning of <HI>November,</HI> and as it were to anticipate the Applications which were preparing to be made from &s;everal Parts of the Country to the Parliament, for disbanding the Army, the King of his own accord &s;eeing all things in Peace, order'd a Reduction of the Forces.</P>
<P>This Reduction was very con&s;iderable, tho' not &s;o much as &s;ome thought rea&s;onable, for the re|maining Army amounted to above 16000, which being near double the Number of the u&s;ual <HI>Briti&s;h</HI>
<PB N="176" REF="441">
E&s;tabli&s;hment in Time of Peace, cau&s;ed great Strug|gles in the en&s;uing Parliament for a farther Reducti|on, as &s;hall be &s;hewed in its Place.</P>
<P>This Reduction being once Re&s;olv'd on, was put in Execution with &s;uch Celerity, that between the <HI>13th</HI> and the <HI>23d</HI> of <HI>November</HI> all the Troops were reduc'd, and the new Model of the Army form'd.</P>
<P>In this Interval, the Convocation met pur&s;uant to their former Prorogation, but found no Acce&s;s to enter upon the Bu&s;ine&s;s which was expected, <HI>viz.</HI> the Controver&s;y with the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Bangor:</HI> On the contrary, they met with a farther Prorogation for &s;ome Months longer. Some thought, that up|on the Occa&s;ion of this Prorogation, the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Bangor</HI> would have been de&s;ired, or at lea&s;t of his own accord, and to &s;hew him&s;elf a fair Adver&s;ary, would have likewi&s;e forborn entring any farther into the Controver&s;y in Print, and that con&s;equently, his An&s;wer to the Report of the Convocation, of which the World had frequent Hints that it was preparing, would have been laid a&s;ide, till the Convocation had been at Liberty of Acting, and might have had Opportunity of replying again.</P>
<P>But they who thought &s;o, either knew not the Bi&s;hop, or knew nothing of his De&s;igns; for upon A&s;&s;urance of the Prorogation being at hand, his An&s;wer was prepar'd; but whether upon A&s;&s;urance of its being Prorogued the An&s;wer was re&s;olved to be publi&s;hed, is not equally certain: Be that as it will, on the <HI>Monday</HI> after the Parliament met, his Lord&s;hip's An&s;wer to the Convocation was pub|li&s;hed.</P>
<P>On the <HI>21&s;t</HI> of <HI>November</HI> the Parliament met, and the King open'd the Se&s;&s;ion as u&s;ual with a Speech, as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<PB N="177" REF="442">
<P>My Lords and Gentlemen,</P>
<P>I <HI>Am very glad I have been able to bring the Sitting of Parliament into a more proper and u&s;ual Sea|&s;on of the Year: I hope &s;uch an early Meeting will not only be a Benefit to the Publick, but a Conveni|ence to your Private Affairs.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As I have always had at Heart the Security and Ea&s;e of my People; &s;o I never kept up any Troops but for their Protection, and have taken every Op|portunity to Disband as many as I thought con&s;i&s;tent with their Safety. I have Reduced the Army to very near one half, &s;ince the Beginning of the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, and Le&s;&s;ened them to &s;uch a Num|ber, as will neither be a Burthen to my good Sub|jects, nor an Encouragement to our Enemies to In|&s;ult them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>You cannot but be &s;en&s;ible of the many Attempts which have been &s;et on foot to di&s;turb the Peace of</HI> Europe, <HI>and of the&s;e Kingdoms: They only pretend not to &s;ee, who are not afraid of them. But as no Application has been wanting on my Part to pre&s;erve the Publick Tranquillity; I have the Plea&s;ure to find my good Offices have not been altogether &V;n&s;ucce&s;sful, and have Rea&s;on to hope they will, in the End, have their full and de&s;ired Effect.</HI></P>
<Q><P>Gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Commons,</P>
<P><HI>I que&s;tion not but you are very well plea&s;ed to find that your Endeavours for le&s;&s;ening the National Debts, have at the &s;ame time rais'd the Publick Cre|dit; and that whatever was propo&s;ed for that End, is actually and compleatly effected. This Succe&s;s mu&s;t chiefly be attributed to that ju&s;t and prudent</HI>
<PB N="178" REF="443">
<HI>Regard you have &s;hewn to Parliamentary Engage|ments.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It was with the View of procuring and &s;ettling a la&s;ting Tranquillity, that I demanded the Extraordi|nary Supply which you granted Me la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion. The Credit which this Confidence repo&s;ed in Me hath gi|ven us Abroad, his already been &s;o far effectual, that I can acquaint you we have a much better Pro|&s;pect than we had. I have ordered an Account to be laid before you, of the very &s;mall Part of that Sup|ply which as yet has been expended; any farther I&s;&s;ues that may be made of it, &s;hall be al&s;o laid before you: And you may be a&s;&s;ured, that every Part of it &s;hall either be imployed for your Service, or &s;aved to the Publick.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I have ordered to be laid before you a State of the Deficiencies of the pre&s;ent Year, and the &s;everal E&s;ti|mates for the Service of the next, which you will find con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed. I rely upon your ma|king the nece&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ion for them; not doubting of the Continuance of that Zeal for the Good of your Country, which hath been &s;o eminently Con&s;picuous in every Se&s;&s;ion of this Parliament.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I cannot, in Ju&s;tice, avoid putting you in mind, that &s;everal Arrears of Pay and Sub&s;idy, incurred before My Acce&s;&s;ion to the Crown, are claimed by Fo|reign Princes and States: I &s;hall order them to be laid before you, to the End you may put them in a Method of being Examined and Stated; which will very much tend to the Honour and Credit of the Na|tion.</HI></P></Q>
<Q><P>My Lords and Gentlemen,</P>
<P><HI>I could heartily wi&s;h, that at a Time when the Com|mon Enemies of our Religion are, by all manner of</HI>
<PB N="179" REF="444">
<HI>Artifices, endeavouring to undermine and weaken it both at Home and Abroad, all tho&s;e who are Friends to our pre&s;ent happy E&s;tabli&s;hment, might unanimou&s;ly concur in &s;ome proper Method for the greater &s;trengthning the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t; of which, as the Church of</HI> England <HI>is unque&s;tionably the main Sup|port and Bulwark, &s;o will She reap the principal Be|nefit of every Advantage accruing by the Union, and mutual Charity of all Prote&s;tants.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As none can recommend them&s;elves more effectually to my Favour and Countenance than by a &s;incere Zeal for the ju&s;t Rights of the Crown, and the Liberties of the People; &s;o I am determined to Encourage all tho&s;e who act agreeably to the Con&s;titution of the&s;e My Kingdoms, and con&s;equently to the Principles on which My Government is founded.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Eyes of all</HI> Europe <HI>are upon you at this Criti|cal Juncture: It is your Intere&s;t, for which Rea&s;on I think it Mine, that my Endeavours for procuring the Peace and Quiet of</HI> Chri&s;tendom <HI>&s;hould take Ef|fect. Nothing can &s;o much contribute to this de|&s;irable End, as the Unanimity, Di&s;patch, and Vigour of your Re&s;olutions for the Support of My Govern|ment.</HI></P></Q>
<P>The Addre&s;&s;es and An&s;wers following this Speech as things of Cour&s;e, I al&s;o of Cour&s;e omit, being too tedious and of too little import to interrupt the Thread of my Story; it is enough to &s;ay they were full of dutiful Expre&s;&s;ions, Promi&s;es of complying with, and di&s;patching what the King demanded, and the like.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the u&s;ual Addre&s;&s;es, the Hou&s;es took up &s;ome Time in congratulating the Royal Family on the Birth of the young Prince; this they did to the
<PB N="180" REF="445">
Prince by a Me&s;&s;age, but to the King by an Ad|dre&s;s.</P>
<P>The Part of the King's Speech, which pointed at the Liberty of the Di&s;&s;enters, and taking off the re&s;training Laws from them, gave great Um|brage for a while; but as the Hou&s;e offer'd no|thing at it, and the Court pu&s;h'd it no farther, all the Strife and Di&s;&s;atisfaction which that Affair threaten'd in its Time, was happily and wi&s;ely prevented.</P>
<P>While the&s;e Things were doing, we had a little Spice of Rebellion in the <HI>We&s;t</HI> of <HI>England;</HI> but tho' &s;ome People went a great way to per&s;uade us there was &s;ome Jacobiti&s;m and Trea&s;on in it, yet it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, upon a clear Enquiry into the Fact, there was nothing of that kind to be found in it; only a little popular Di&s;content between the Weavers, Wool-combers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> and their Employers about the Rates of their Wages, working <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Yarn, and the like; and yet we will not &s;ay, but the Di&s;order was &s;uch as may bring a few of them to the Gallows, if his Maje&s;ty's Cle|mency do not interpo&s;e.</P>
<P>It was the latter End of <HI>November,</HI> that Sir <HI>George Eyng,</HI> with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Squadron of Men of War returned from the <HI>Baltick,</HI> after a very rough, &s;tor|my, hazardous Voyage, bringing over with him under his Convoy 200 Sail of Merchant Ships, and not having yet found any occa&s;ion of Ho&s;tility again&s;t the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Fleet, or been able to di&s;cover any thing of the great De&s;ign which it was &s;aid the <HI>Swedes</HI> had again&s;t us in Favour of the Preten|der.</P>
<P>It was the third of the &s;ame Month that the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI>'s Son was baptiz'd, and upon the occa&s;ion
<PB N="181" REF="446">
whereof, &s;ome Words happen'd between the Prince and the Duke of <HI>Newc&mdash;e;</HI> which Words, and the Circum&s;tances of them, were &s;uch, as gave the King great Offence, and from which has proceeded all the Mi&s;under&s;tanding that has happen'd &s;ince between the Prince and the King his Father.</P>
<P>I will not enter into this Story in my own Words, but keeping only to the Truth of that Fact as near as I can give it in the Form in which it has been already publi&s;hed; for I &s;hall be very loth to give Offence on one Side or on the other.</P>
<P>The Third of <HI>December</HI> was appointed for the baptizing the young Prince, the King's Grand&s;on; his Royal Highne&s;s the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> Father to the Royal Infant, had it &s;eems pitch'd upon the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>O&s;n$burgh,</HI> his Maje&s;ty's Brother, to be one of the Godfathers, as being the true <HI>Parain, viz.</HI> the next of Kin; after the King him&s;elf (as I &s;uppo&s;e) intended the Lord <HI>Cham|berlain</HI> of the Hou&s;hold, <HI>viz.</HI> the Duke of <HI>New|ca&s;tle,</HI> to repre&s;ent him; and as his Royal Highne&s;s expre&s;&s;es it (in one of the Letters, which it is &s;aid he wrote to the King) <HI>if tho&s;e Copies we &s;ee in Print are Genuine,</HI> he was made to believe that the King appeared ea&s;ie in the Choice he had made.</P>
<P>But when the Ceremony came to be perform'd, the Duke of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> &s;tood Godfather with the King, not as Proxy, or repre&s;enting the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> but for him&s;elf in his own Name and Per&s;on. This the Prince &s;ays in the &s;ame Letters (if genuine as above) he thought an unaccountable Hard&s;hip, and there is no doubt his Royal Highne&s;s made &s;ome Steps to have prevented or avoided it as a Hard&s;hip; at lea&s;t while he thought there was room for it, and while he might imagine that it was not
<PB N="182" REF="447">
a Thing &s;o fix'd as he afterwards found it to be <HI>But the &s;ame Letters tell us, that</HI> as &s;oon as his Royal Highne&s;s found that his Maje&s;ty thought proper to command it: He &s;ubmitted.</P>
<P>Had his Royal Highne&s;s thought fit to have &s;top'd here, perhaps all had been well; but as he took it extremely ill from the Duke of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> it &s;eems as if his Royal Highne&s;s mu&s;t be per&s;uaded that the &s;aid Duke had taken &s;ome &s;teps in it of him&s;elf, or other than his Maje&s;ty's Command oblig'd him to becau&s;e the Words <HI>in tho&s;e Letters,</HI> this Treat|ment of the Duke, and as it is in the French, <HI>this Proceeding</HI> of the Duke of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> immediately follows.</P>
<P>It &s;eems therefore to me, that the Prince re&s;ented <HI>the Proceedings</HI> of the Duke, not as he acted in O|bedience to his Maje&s;ty's Command, but as if the Duke had done &s;omething which he was not com|manded, or at lea&s;t &s;eem'd officious to do in the Matter; I do not take upon me to &s;ay, or &s;o much as to &s;ugge&s;t, that the Duke did &s;o, but 'tis evi|dent the Prince &s;eem'd to under&s;tand it &s;o; and therefore in the Paper mentioned before, which is publi&s;h'd as his Royal Highne&s;s's Letter, <HI>&s;uppo&s;ing only</HI> they may be the Prince's Words, <Q>he &s;ays, &startq;This <HI>Proceeding</HI> touch'd his Royal Highne&s;s &s;en|&s;ibly, and &s;o far rais'd his Indignation, as that&endq; he could not help &s;hewing it.</Q></P>
<P>It remains to relate how his Royal Highne&s;s &s;hew'd his Indignation to the Duke on this Occa&s;ion, and this indeed is rather to be buried in Silence, then recorded to Po&s;terity, I mean as to the Parti|cular, becau&s;e of the unhappy Con&s;equences: It &s;uffices then to &s;ay, that his Royal Highne&s;s &s;eeing the Duke after the Ceremony was over, &s;poke &s;ome
<PB N="183" REF="448">
warm Words to him, &s;hewing his Re&s;entment at what he had done.</P>
<P>This, as I heard, being reported to the King, his Maje&s;ty has been plea&s;ed to take in a quite different Manner, from what I have &s;uppo&s;ed the Prince in|tended it: <HI>Note,</HI> as you go on, I do not &s;ay the King took the&s;e Things in a different Manner from what they were de&s;ign'd or intended to be under|&s;tood, but different from that which I have &s;up|po&s;ed to be the intent; for in this I go only upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of their being intended as is menti|oned in the &s;aid Letters, and &s;till &s;uppo&s;ing, tho' not undertaking to &s;ay, that tho&s;e Letters are Genuine.</P>
<P>Upon the Report of the Words, his Maje&s;ty thought fit to give a &s;udden Mark of his di&s;|plea&s;ure by &s;ome Commands to the Prince, con|fining his Royal Highne&s;s to his own Apartment, till his Maje&s;ty's farther Plea&s;ure was known; to which his Royal Highne&s;s immediately &s;ub|mitted.</P>
<P>Soon after this, his Maje&s;ty's farther Plea|&s;ure was &s;ignified to the Prince, <HI>viz.</HI> That he &s;hould leave St. <HI>James</HI>'s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I need &s;ay no more.</P>
<P>Accordingly his Royal Highne&s;s quitted the Pa|lace, the Prince&s;s going along with him, but not the Children, and retir'd to the Lord <HI>Gran|tham</HI>'s Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The Parliament was now Sitting, and the King's Speech mention'd above lay before them, and the main Thing that they entred upon the Debate of, was that Part which relates to the reducing the Troops: In this Ca&s;e &s;everal extraordinary Speeches were made, and among the re&s;t, one
<PB N="184" REF="449">
by <HI>Shippen,</HI> a Northern Member, who u&s;ing a di&s;ta&s;teful Freedom of Speech, was call'd to the Bar, and committed to the <HI>Tower;</HI> the Words which the Hou&s;e re&s;ented were the&s;e, <HI>viz. That the &s;econd Part of the King's Speech &s;eem'd rather to be calculated for the Meridian of</HI> Germany, <HI>than</HI> Great-Britain; <HI>That the King is a Stranger to our Language and Con&s;titution.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the&s;e Words, the Hou&s;e immediately cal|led him to the Bar: In a Word, they were warm|ly re&s;ented, and no Room being left for Extenua|tions or Explanations, at lea&s;t none offering that were &s;ufficient, it was in&s;i&s;ted, that Mr. <HI>Shippen</HI> be Committed to the <HI>Tower:</HI> The committing was oppos'd by many Members, Friends to Mr. <HI>Ship|pen,</HI> and occa&s;ioned a long Debate, which la&s;ted till Eleven a Clock, when it was carried to &s;end Mr. <HI>Shippen</HI> to the <HI>Tower,</HI> by a great Majority, being 171 again&s;t 84. Accordingly, the next Day he was committed to the <HI>Tower,</HI> where he &s;till remains, having, as we hear, been very much indi&s;pos'd there, and as &s;ome &s;ay, dangerou&s;ly ill.</P>
<P>Upon this Committing Mr. <HI>Shippen,</HI> &s;ome Mem|bers mov'd that the Words which gave Offence might be printed, which was re&s;olv'd, and accor|dingly they were made publick; that the Vote of the Hou&s;e for committing is thus expre&s;s'd, <HI>viz.</HI> That the &s;aid Words <HI>are highly di&s;honourable to, and unju&s;tly reflecting on, His Maje&s;ty's Per&s;on and Go|vernment.</HI></P>
<P>After this the Hou&s;e went on with the Debate, and after a long Struggle, the Court carry'd it, that the &s;tanding Forces upon the E&s;tabli&s;hment for <HI>Great-Britain</HI> &s;hould be 16347 effective Men, including Officers.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="450">

<P>This Struggle about the Army being over, the Hou&s;e of Commons fell upon a long Debate about lowering the Intere&s;t of Money, and regulating the Value of our Coin. As to the fir&s;t of the&s;e it was pa&s;s'd over for this Se&s;&s;ion, but the la&s;t enga|ged the whole Hou&s;e in a great Labyrinth of Di&s;|pute. The State of our Coin at that time admits this brief De&s;cription: Our Coin con&s;i&s;ted of Cop|per, Silver, Gold; the Copper Coin is at a low Ebb for want of Quantity, and it is to be rectified, or the deficiency to be &s;upplied by renewing the Species only, and encrea&s;ing the Quantity; to which
<PB N="186" REF="451">
purpo&s;e &s;everal Orders have been i&s;&s;ued, and the Me|tal in &s;ufficient Quantity being now provided, it is expected we &s;hall in a little while have a full Sup|ply of Halfpence and Farthings, which are indeed greatly wanted for common Occa&s;ions in Petty-Pay|ments, and the lowe&s;t Part of Commerce. It &s;eems there has been &s;ome defect or delay in this Matter; and &s;ome have publi&s;h'd, that the Metal was bad which was furni&s;hed for this Work; but as others again have contradicted the Report, and promi&s;ed a &s;peedy Production; we wait with as much Satisfa|ction as other People, the compleating that Work.</P>
<P>The next Species is the Gold, of which there was no want; but on the other hand it is alledged, that our Guinea going at One Pound One Shilling Six Pence is more than the Gold is worth, as it ought to go; as it &s;eem'd we have &s;ome inequality con|cerning the rate of Gold in other Parts (as they &s;tood proportioned to the rate of Silver Coin in tho&s;e Parts) to the rate of Gold and Silver here.</P>
<P>This made the rate of our Gold Coin appear too high, and the rate of our Silver Coin appear too low; and the Hou&s;e taking this into Con&s;ide|ration, tho' without much Debate, re&s;olv'd to re|duce the rate of Guineas to Twenty One Shillings each, and other <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Gold Coin in proportion. This being re&s;olv'd in the Hou&s;e, the Method was next enquir'd into, which was concluded to be, not by Act of Parliament; but by addre&s;&s;ing his Maje|&s;ty to I&s;&s;ue out his Proclamation for it, which was done.</P>
<PB N="187" REF="452">
<Q><P>By the King, A Proclamation, Declaring the Rates at which Gold &s;hall be current in Payments.</P>
<P>GEORGER.</P>
<P><HI>WHereas the Value of the Gold, compared with the Value of the Silver in the current Coins of this Realm, as Paid and Received, is grea|ter in Proportion than the Value of Gold is to the Value of Silver in the Neighbouring Nations; and the Over-valuation of Gold in the current Coins of this Realm hath been a great Cau&s;e of carrying out and le&s;&s;ening the Species of the Silver Coins there|of, which is highly Prejudicial to the Trade of this Kingdom: And whereas the Commons in Parlia|ment have by their Addre&s;s humbly be&s;ought Us, That we would be Graciou&s;ly Plea&s;ed to I&s;&s;ue Our Royal Proclamation, to forbid all Per&s;ons to utter or Receive any of the Pieces of Gold, called Guineas, at any greater or higher Rate than one and twenty Shillings for each Guinea, and &s;o proportionably for any greater or le&s;&s;er Pieces of Coined Gold; Which We have Graciou&s;ly Conde&s;cended unto. Now for and towards Remedying the &s;aid Evil, We have thought fit, with the Advice of Our Privy-Council, to I&s;&s;ue this Our Royal Proclamation, hereby &s;trictly Prohibiting all and every Per&s;on and Per&s;ons what|&s;oever to Utter or Receive any of the Pieces of Gold Coin of this Kingdom, commonly called Guineas (which in our Mint were Coined only at Twenty Shil|lings each, but have been by Our Subjects Paid and Re|ceived at the Rate of one and twenty Shillings and Six Pence each) at any greater or higher Rate or Value than one and twenty Shillings for each Guinea, and &s;o proportionably for the Pieces of Gold, called Half-Guineas, Double-Guineas, and five Pound</HI>
<PB N="188" REF="453">
<HI>Pieces; And the other Pieces of Ancient Gold Coin of this Kingdom, which by their Wearing may be Dimini&s;hed in their Weight, at any greater or higher Rate or Value than as followeth, That is to &s;ay, The Piece of Gold now Received and Paid for three and twenty Shillings and Six Pence, to be hereafter Re|ceived and Paid for Three and twenty Shillings, and no more; The Piece of Gold now Received and Paid for Five and twenty Shillings and Six Pence, to be hereafter Received and Paid for Five and twenty Shillings, and no more; and &s;o proportionably for &s;maller Pieces of the like Gold Coin: At which Rates and Values, We do hereby Declare the &s;aid re&s;pective Pieces of Coined Gold to be Current. And we do hereby &s;trictly Charge and Command all Our Loving Subjects what&s;oever, that they do not pre&s;ume to Receive or Pay the Gold Coins of this Realm at any greater Rates or Values than the Rates and Values afore&s;aid, upon Pain of Our highe&s;t Di&s;|plea&s;ure, and upon Pain of the greate&s;t Puni&s;hment that by Law may be inflicted upon them for their Default, Negligence, and Contempt in this Behalf.</HI></P>
<P>Given at Our Court at St. <HI>James</HI>'s the Twenty &s;econd Day of <HI>December,</HI> 1717. In the Fourth Year of Our Reign.</P>
<P><HI>God Save the KING.</HI></P></Q>
<P>There was a Rumour, that the Value of the Sil|ver Coin would be rai&s;ed in Proportion to what the Gold had fallen; but this had a &s;udden Influence upon Trade, which was very near being fatal to us, <HI>viz.</HI> That on a &s;udden, all the Silver Coin di&s;ap|pear'd, and People were put to the greate&s;t Incon|venience
<PB N="189" REF="454">
imaginable to carry on petty Trade, for no ready Money was to be &s;een but Gold.</P>
<P>This oblig'd the Parliament, when they came together again, to pa&s;s a Vote, that they would not alter the Value of Silver Coin, and this in a few Months brought the Money out again.</P>
<P>As the Difference between the King and the Prince grew rather wider every Day than other, and no Pro&s;pect appear'd of its being reconcil'd or made up, the Prince removed from the Lord <HI>Grantham</HI>'s, and bought him&s;elf a Hou&s;e in <HI>Leice&s;ter-Fields,</HI> former|ly the Dwelling-hou&s;e of <HI>Seymour Portman,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> a private Gentleman, but of an immen&s;e Wealth, and we &s;ince find his Royal Highne&s;s has adjoin'd <HI>Leice&s;ter-Hou&s;e</HI> to it; &s;o that together he will have a large hand&s;ome Palace: As to his Summer Re&s;idence, he has fix'd upon a Hou&s;e near <HI>Richmond,</HI> the &s;ame that the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> formerly liv'd in, where his whole Family, his Children excepted, who were always kept at Court, were very well ac|commodated.</P>
<P>His Royal Highne&s;s had before this written &s;e|veral Letters to the King, which it was hop'd would, with the Interce&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e who wi&s;h'd well to both Sides, have prevail'd; but the&s;e not being &s;a|tisfactory, the Family &s;ettled as above, and our Hi|&s;tory will not have the Felicity to relate the End of this Breach, at lea&s;t not in this Part of it.</P>
<P>It was in Pro&s;ecution of this Difference between the King and the Prince, that the King thought fit to cau&s;e him&s;elf to be made capable of being nomi|nated Governour of the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Company, a Tran|&s;action very particular and remarkable; the brief Hi|&s;tory of the Fact I &s;hall relate, as to the Rea&s;ons and De&s;igns of it, that I have no Room for, or ra|ther no Inclination to run the Ri&s;que of the Enquiry.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="455">
The Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> had, ever &s;ince the coming of King <HI>George</HI> to the Crown, been Governor of the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Company: The fir&s;t Governor, who was the Earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> having thought fit to lay down, and having al&s;o unqualified him&s;elf by &s;el|ing out his Stock, from being any more elected, the Company made their Court to the Prince, and as it is nece&s;&s;ary by the Con&s;titution of the Company, that whoever is Governor of the Company, mu&s;t be entituled to Ten Thou&s;and Pounds Original Stock, the Company in their fir&s;t Tran&s;ports, were plea&s;ed to compliment the Prince with &s;uch an Article of Stock, in order in the next Place to chu&s;e him their Governor.</P>
<P>Upon the late unhappy Mi&s;under&s;tanding be|tween the King and the Prince, and the latter being under the King's Di&s;plea&s;ure &s;o far as to be bani&s;hed, or removed rather from his Maje&s;ty's Councils and Pre&s;ence, the Company was given to under&s;tand that the King was become a Proprietor of their Stock; his Maje&s;ty it &s;eems had transferred to him in his own Name, and accordingly had Credit in the Com|pany's Books for above Ten Thou&s;and Pound Stock. This was Intimation &s;ufficient to the Company, that his Maje&s;ty might, if he plea&s;ed to accept of it, be nam'd their Governor. I do not at all pretend to &s;ay, that this Stock was purcha&s;ed in order to &s;uch an Election; but if it may be &s;aid to &s;eem to be &s;o, it mu&s;t al&s;o be allowed to &s;eem to be on the Companies &s;ide, that if the King did them the Ho|nour to become a Proprietor of their Stock, they could not but think it their Duty to name his Ma|je&s;ty as Governor of the Company; not to do this, had been indeed to have made the King, &s;o far as he was a Member of the Company, a Subject to whoever &s;hould be the Company's Governor; and
<PB N="191" REF="456">
on the other Hand, if the Prince continued in the Po&s;t of Governor, as but on this Occa&s;ion was likely e|nough, this would be to make the Prince Governor over the King, and the Son Governor over the Fa|ther; I mean at lea&s;t as far as concern'd their &s;hare in the Stock of the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Company.</P>
<P>This being the Situation of the Company's Af|fairs, they agreed upon an Addre&s;s to the King, to de&s;ire his Maje&s;ty would do them the Honour to u&s;e his Name as Governor of the Company in their en|&s;uing Election; this was the la&s;t Day of the la&s;t Month, and accordingly the Addre&s;s being drawn up, and approved in the u&s;ual Form, and the Per|&s;ons nominated who were to go up with it, <Q>on <HI>Sa|turday</HI> the fir&s;t of <HI>February,</HI> &startq;a con&s;iderable Number of the Principal Proprietors in the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Com|pany waited on his Maje&s;ty at St. <HI>James</HI>'s, and be|ing introduc'd by his Grace the Duke of <HI>Newca|&s;tle,</HI> Lord Chamberlain, pre&s;ented the following Addre&s;s to his Maje&s;ty. They were all admitted to ki&s;s his Maje&s;ty's Hand, and his Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to confer the Honour of Kinghthood on&endq; <HI>George Ca&s;well</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></Q></P>

<P>The King having thus accepted their offer, was on the 4th unanimou&s;ly Elected their Governor, an Act of Parliament having pa&s;s'd the Hou&s;es for that Purpo&s;e, and having receiv'd the Royal A&s;&s;ent the Day before. It &s;eems there were &s;ome Rea&s;ons in the Nature of the Royal Sovereignty of the King's Per&s;on, or as a re&s;erve to the Dignity of the Throne, which required that a Law on purpo&s;e &s;hould be made, before Subjects could in any Ca&s;e be &s;aid to elect their Sovereign to be their Governor, who was in all Ca&s;es their &s;upreme Governor before in Right of the Royal Prerogative: But whether this was all the Rea&s;on or not, I do not pretend to determine; but it is certain &s;uch an Act was nece&s;&s;ary, and therefore was previou&s;ly concerted, and having pa&s;s'd through both Hou&s;es in two Days time, was pa&s;s'd by the King on <HI>Feb.</HI> 3. and the King declared Go|vernor the next Day.</P>
<P>Now tho' the Election of Governor was car|ried, as is &s;aid, unanimou&s;ly, yet this Affair could not but create &s;ome Fractions, we are loth to &s;ay Factions, tho' if we &s;hould go that length, the ill

<P>The Di&s;putes among them &s;eem'd to be managed in the Election of their new People, &s;uch as the Sub-Governor, Deputy-Governor, and Directors for the coming Year; but the Rea&s;on and Cau&s;e of tho&s;e Things pointed higher a great deal: Sir <HI>James Bate|man</HI> had di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the Prince's Intere&s;t on many Occa&s;ions, and more particularly in this of the Governor of the Company: It was &s;aid for Ex|ample, That he did not deliver the Prince's Surren|der of the Office of Governor in the Manner, and at the Time they ought to have had it. That he ad|journ'd the General Court in an irregular Manner, and when Bu&s;ine&s;s of Moment was before them. And in a Word, That he thwarted the De&s;ign of ha|ving the King be addre&s;s'd and elected Governor of the Company, as much as he could.</P>
<P>This di&s;gu&s;ted a great many of the Members of the General Court, and immediately a Party was form'd again&s;t Sir <HI>James,</HI> viz. To &s;et up another again&s;t him in the Election for a Sub-Governor, which was to be the &s;ame Day that the King was to be declar'd Governor.</P>
<P>To oppo&s;e Sir <HI>James,</HI> the new Party made a Meeting at the <HI>Crown</HI> Tavern behind the <HI>Exchange,</HI> mu&s;tred all their Friends, told No&s;es, and, as all Factions do, flatter'd them&s;elves they were &s;trong|er than they were, and &s;et up Sir <HI>Theo.

Sir <HI>James</HI> could not have de&s;ir'd a better Adver|&s;ary, not only for the ju&s;t Character of the Per&s;on, but becau&s;e he was of a Temper him&s;elf, and join'd with a Party who generally pu&s;h'd their Projects not &s;o much by the Knowledge of their Strength, as the Warmth of their Pa&s;&s;ions; not making a Judg|ment &s;o much by the Solidity of Calculations, as the Pre&s;umption of their Party; For this Image they &s;et up was &s;o unfit to make an Idol of, that it appear'd, in the Event, he had not Merit enough to be made a&mdash;Step to it: He was &s;o far from having Intere&s;t enough to be made a Sub-Gover|nour, that he could not get in to be made a Dire|ctor; &s;o he walk'd off: Like a certain Draper, who being &s;et up at his own Reque&s;t to be cho&s;en Common-Council-Man, was &s;ent back to his Pari&s;h to &s;erve Scavinger and Con&s;table.</P>
<P>In a Word, after much Clubbing and Caballing, much Huff and Blu&s;ter, on one Side or other, Sir <HI>James</HI> was, by a Majority of &s;ome Hundreds, cho&s;en Sub-Governor, and Mr. <HI>Samuel Shepheard</HI> Deputy-Governour of the Company, the &s;ame Day that the King was Nominated, <HI>I am loth to call it Elected,</HI> Governor.</P>

<P>Thus this <HI>South-Sea</HI> Storm blew over, and things began to run in the former Channel; the Stock|jobbers made the be&s;t they cou'd of the Bargain, and pretended to rai&s;e the Stock on the great Pro|&s;pect of this new Favour; as if &s;ome particular Advantage more than the Honour of having the King to their Governour had been in view: What that Advantage may be, we yet cannot &s;ay, but Time may di&s;cover it.</P>
<P>After this unhappy Court-Breach had thus taken Root, the young Prince who had been, tho' invo|luntarily, the Occa&s;ion of his Father's Misfortunes, was removed by that Fate, which doubtle&s;s deter|min'd his &s;hort &s;tay to be fruitful of that remarka|ble Event: Upon the Death of the Child, the Bo|dy was open'd by the Surgeons, who made the fol|lowing Report.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;IN opening the Corps of his Highne&s;s Prince <HI>George William,</HI> we found a great Quantity of Water in the Head, lodged between the <HI>Pia|mater</HI> and Brain, all the Sub&s;tance of the Brain &s;ofter than u&s;ual, and the Ventricles fuller of Wa|ter.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;All the Entrails of the Lower Belly were in good Condition. In the Brea&s;t, we found the

<P><Q>&startq;In the Heart there was a great Polypus in each Ventricle, which had Branches in all the Blood&endq; Ve&s;&s;els, and hinder'd Circulation.</Q></P>
<P>The Funeral of this Prince was private; it was appointed the <HI>12th,</HI> when the Corps was depo&s;i|ted in the Royal Vault, under the Chapel of King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abby,</HI> with the following In&s;cription:</P>

<P>The Dean of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> perform'd the Office, and read the Service at the Interment; the Direction of the whole Funeral being ordered by the Lord Chamberlain, <HI>viz.</HI> the Duke of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> his famous Godfather. Upon
<PB N="198" REF="463">
which it has been wittily ob&s;erv'd, that the Lord Chamberlain had the Honour to introduce the Prince twice into the Church, <HI>viz.</HI> once into the Bo&s;om of it, and once into the Bowels of it.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Commons was all this while &s;itting, and among the re&s;t of their Tran&s;actions, this was not the lea&s;t &s;ignificant, <HI>viz.</HI> The &s;elling the for|feited E&s;tates, in which they met with great Diffi|culties, e&s;pecially in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as has been &s;aid; and therefore it was nece&s;&s;ary to bring in a Bill for the empowering the Commi&s;&s;ioners to Sell ab&s;olutely, without any Re&s;erve or Appeal, after all Claims that were come in had been adju&s;ted, and a rea&s;ona|ble Time given for bringing in more.</P>
<P>But now they met with an Interruption of ano|ther Nature, <HI>viz.</HI> the Petitions of the mi&s;erable Fa|milies who were Reduc'd by this Misfortune, lying at their Feet for Bread; and the&s;e being to be re|fer'd by the Hou&s;e to the King, in the Cour&s;e of Things his Maje&s;ty refer'd it back to the Hou&s;e by Me&s;&s;age, intimating, that the King had nothing to object, if the Hou&s;e pleas'd to grant any Relief to the di&s;tre&s;s'd Families that petition'd.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e was the Lord <HI>Widdrington,</HI> who&s;e whole E&s;tate being &s;eiz'd, he had not the lea&s;t Sub&s;i&s;tence for him&s;elf and Children; and the King gave a favourable An&s;wer, referring him to the Hou&s;e of Commons, ordering it to be &s;ignify'd to the Hou&s;e, That he will not ob&s;truct their Cha|rity, or decline granting any Thing the Hou&s;e &s;hall think fit to do in it; and when his Lord&s;hip Peti|tion'd the Hou&s;e, Mr. Comptroller acquainted them. That he was commanded to acquaint the Hou&s;e with it accordingly: And we hear that <HI>700 l. per Annum</HI> has been allotted his Lord&s;hip,
<PB N="199" REF="464">
and to de&s;cend with &s;ome Limitation to his Po&s;te|rity.</P>
<P>The Petition of the Lord <HI>Widdrington</HI> was fol|low'd by many more, <HI>viz. John</HI> and <HI>Henry Balfour, John Car&s;tairs, Patrick Seaton, Rob. Rollo,</HI> late Lord <HI>Rollo,</HI> Lady <HI>Philippa Standi&s;h,</HI> Daughter to the late Duke of <HI>Norfolk, Margaret Thornton, Frances Dalton, Mary</HI> and <HI>Dorothy Hodg&s;on, Anne Walton, Elizabeth Iba&s;to,</HI> and others. Upon the&s;e Petitions, and con&s;idering that many Petitions were expected to follow the&s;e, it was offer'd at by &s;ome, That a certain Part of the E&s;tates of the forfeited Per&s;ons &s;hould be in his Maje&s;ty's Power, to di&s;po&s;e as his Royal Clemency might dictate, for the Re|lief of their di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Wives and Children. But the Hou&s;e would not agree to that neither; &s;o what Petitions are not granted, will never be gran|ted; nor will it be in the Power, even of the King him&s;elf to relieve Per&s;ons Petitioning afterwards, except out of his own Pocket.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e E&s;tates that was actually Sold, was the Lord <HI>Widdrington</HI>'s, being an E&s;tate in <HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> valued at <HI>1460 l. per Annum,</HI> and bought by Sir <HI>Robert Chaplin;</HI> it was &s;et up at <HI>26000 l.</HI> and &s;old by Inch of Candle or Auction for <HI>34500 l.</HI> being a very noble E&s;tate, and well Wood|ed: This Sale however was not made till <HI>Septem|ber</HI> the following Year.</P>
<P>About this time mo&s;t of the Parliament Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;eem'd to give way a while to a long and warm Debate, upon the main Point &s;o often mentioned be|fore, about disbanding and reducing the Army.</P>
<P>The Di&s;pute began under the Con&s;ideration of a Bill, entitul'd, <HI>For puni&s;hing Mutiny and De&s;ertion, and better regulating the Forces.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="465">
The Sum of the Que&s;tion was in two Parts; <HI>1&s;t,</HI> About the Number of the Troops to be E&s;ta|bli&s;hed, which however it had been debated and determined before, yet admitted &s;ome Debate now again, for tho&s;e Gentlemen who were for the Redu|ction of the Army, never gave it over, when they had any opportunity to take up the Argument.</P>
<P>But that being carry'd as far as it would go, they came <HI>2dly,</HI> To Laws for Government of the Sol|diers, and the manner of Proceeding again&s;t them in capital Ca&s;es, which after &s;everal Re&s;erves and Regulations, &s;ome in Favour of the Con&s;titution, and &s;ome empowering the Civil Magi&s;trate to act; at length a Law was &s;ettled for the Soldiery, &s;uch as it is, and the Heads of it were publi&s;hed by the King's Order, for pre&s;erving them in their Duty, which Rules however being pretty equally ob&s;erved, the Soldiery take no great Advantage, and it being but for a Year al&s;o, I do not hear it complain'd on.</P>
<P>The Parliament being now in full Bu&s;ine&s;s, it is to my Purpo&s;e to give the Heads of their Proceed|ings, particularly in what pa&s;s'd of Moment among them, and &s;o bring the Se&s;&s;ion to a Clo&s;e, that the Story may &s;uffer no injurious Intervals.</P>
<P>The Coin came frequently before them, the Scarcity of Silver was an un&s;ufferable Grievance in Trade, and made the People very unea&s;ie, and the Noi&s;e of any one encrea&s;ing the Grievance made it &s;till wor&s;t, yet one Ca&s;e I may touch upon, and I have wondred often that no farther Occa&s;ion was taken at it among the common People, <HI>viz.</HI> That while both the Hou&s;es were &s;everally imploy'd in finding out the Cau&s;es, as well as Remedies, for the le&s;&s;ening, and indeed the &s;uddain vani&s;hing of the Silver Coin of this Nation; &s;ome Sugge&s;tions were made, That
<PB N="201" REF="466">
a certain Cunning Worker in &s;uch convertible Spe|cies, had turn'd Coin into Bullion to a prodigious Quantity, &s;ome talk, of above an Hundred Thou|&s;and Ounces that were within the Compa&s;s of Di&s;|covery, and that much more might be heard of.</P>
<P>If this had been found effectually out, and prov'd, one would have &s;uppos'd the Hou&s;es need go no farther in that Part of the Enquiry which relates to finding out the Cau&s;es of the Decrea&s;e of our Coin; and therefore we &s;uppo&s;e proper Means will one Time or other be &s;till u&s;ed to fix the Di&s;covery, as no doubt the guilty Per&s;ons are diligent to con|ceal it. I do not hereby &s;ay, however we may have been told, that the cunning Game&s;ter was Sir <HI>Geo. Ca&s;w&mdash;l,</HI> or any other Per&s;on concern'd by or for him; but I leave it to the farther Enquiry of the Parliament, who, I hope, will do their Coun|try Ju&s;tice in a Proper Sea&s;on.</P>
<P>The Abundance of Petitions which were coming from all Parts of the Kingdom for Remedy of this Mi&s;chief, but which were &s;top'd by finding the Hou&s;e enclined to go effectually upon it, may &s;erve to give a Ta&s;te to any one of the great Grievance it was to the Publick to have &s;uch a &s;uddain Scar|city of the Species of Coin, that petty Commerce could hardly be carried on, and even Men that em|ploy'd the Poor, were at a lo&s;s to pay their Wages. But what then will be the Anxiety of the People, and what the Damage to Trade, e&s;pecially the Re|tailer, which is that Part of Trade on which all the re&s;t depends, when they &s;hall find that the Hou&s;es either have not, or perhaps <HI>cannot</HI> find out effectual Remedies for the Mi&s;chief, we mu&s;t leave to Time.</P>
<P>But I leave this as I find it, in &s;ome Confu&s;ion, and much Uncertainty, and proceed to another Ca&s;e
<PB N="202" REF="467">
before the Hou&s;e of Commons, <HI>viz.</HI> That of the Demands of Foreign Princes upon <HI>Great Britain,</HI> for Arrears due to them for Sub&s;idies or Quota's, agreed to be paid to them, to enable them to &s;upport the War, and for Pay of Troops, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Sum the <HI>Dutch</HI> demanded was con&s;iderable; and his Maje&s;ty having promi&s;ed them at their Reque&s;t to recommend it to the Parliament, and having men|tion'd it at the opening the Se&s;&s;ion, a State of the Demand was now ordered by the King's particular Direction to be laid before the Hou&s;e, and was up|on the Hou&s;e's taking it into Con&s;ideration referred to the Commi&s;&s;ioners, who were appointed to &s;tate, take, and determine the Debt due to the Army and Navy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And in this Scituation I mu&s;t leave it for the Pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The Application to the Hou&s;e made by the Mer|chants, and others, for the opening again the <HI>Swe|di&s;h</HI> Trade, was next in Cour&s;e; where we are to note, that &s;everal Petitions had, previous to this, been pre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e, from the Countrey Places where our Iron Manufactures are carried on, &s;uch as <HI>Birmingham, Sheffield, Newca&s;tle,</HI> and others; inwhich they &s;et forth the great Di&s;couragements of their Trade, and the Difficulties they were put to in carrying on their Manufactures by the Prohibition of the Trade to <HI>Sweden;</HI> by which the Importation of Iron, which is the Product of that Country, was &s;top'd and interrupted, and without which they could not carry on their Trade.</P>
<P>Here, by the Way, I might enlarge upon the ma|nife&s;t Injury which Trading Nations always bring upon them&s;elves, when, through the Nece&s;&s;ity of their Affairs, or for any other Con&s;ideration, they are obliged to prohibit any Branches of their Fo|reign Trade, whether it be of Importation or Ex|portation,

there being very few Countries &s;o poor, &s;o barren. &s;o remote, but from whence &s;omething is to be fetch'd that we find wanting to our &s;elves, and ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the carrying on our own Manufactures.</P>
<P>This was much the Ca&s;e of our Commerce with <HI>Sweden,</HI> and which, as I &s;uppo&s;e, occa&s;ioned the&s;e Petitions from the Iron Workers: If there were any private Rea&s;ons, or Agents employed to bring this on Foot with other De&s;igns, that I have nothing to &s;ay to; but this above &s;eemed to be acknowledged in the Con&s;equences of the Thing; for that the Go|vernment thought fit, a few Days after, to publi&s;h a Proclamation for the admitting the Importation of <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Iron, with this Limitation, <HI>viz.</HI> That it &s;hould not come directly from <HI>Sweden,</HI> but from o|ther Places.

<P>Whether the&s;e Things were a Concert with the &s;ame Per&s;ons who applied them&s;elves afterwards in the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Affair, as if the fir&s;t having mi&s;carri|ed of the De&s;ign, was therefore the Rea&s;on of the other, <HI>I know not;</HI> but &s;ome Days after this, there appear'd &s;everal Petitions in more expre&s;s Terms, to de&s;ire the Prohibition of the Trade to <HI>Sweden</HI> might be taken off, or to that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>This was call'd by the following Title, <HI>viz.</HI> A Petition of &s;everal Merchants and Owners of Shipping, in behalf of them&s;elves and others, tra|ding to and from <HI>Sweden;</HI> the Prayer of the Peti|tion was in &s;hort, That the pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances of the Trade to <HI>Sweden</HI> might be taken into Confi|deration, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In the Con&s;equence of this Petition, the Mer|chants on every &s;ide were brought into the Hou&s;e, and what they had to &s;ay was heard fully; al&s;o the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Re&s;ident, Mr. <HI>Jack&s;on,</HI> was heard re|&s;pecting the Memorial, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> pre&s;ented to the <HI>Swe|di&s;h</HI> Court; and the Merchants, who complain'd of Lo&s;&s;es and Captures of Ships by the <HI>Swedes,</HI> were al&s;o heard.</P>
<P>After this the Arguments for re&s;toring and open|ing the Trade on one hand, and the Rea&s;ons for continuing the Prohibition, till Satisfaction was obtain'd for the Lo&s;&s;es of the Merchants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were al&s;o debated at large, but upon the whole, the Com|mons did not think fit to re&s;olve to take off the Prohibition of the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Trade; &s;o that Matter &s;tands ju&s;t as it did.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="473">
We are told, That it was warmly debated in the&s;e Ca&s;es, whether the <HI>Dutch</HI> had done us Ju&s;tice in the Affair of prohibiting Commerce with <HI>Swe|den</HI> or not, and the Papers were call'd for by the Hou&s;e, which pa&s;s'd between the Secretary of State here, and his Maje&s;ty's Re&s;ident in <HI>Holland;</HI> and the Letters from the &s;aid Re&s;ident in <HI>Holland,</HI> back to the Secretary of State; as al&s;o a Memorial deliver'd by the &s;aid Re&s;ident in <HI>Holland</HI> to the States General, on the Subject of the <HI>Dutch</HI> pro|hibiting Commerce with <HI>Sweden;</HI> which, by the way, they never had done, whatever Rea&s;ons we had to expect they would.</P>
<P>But as no Re&s;olutions were made upon the&s;e Debates, I can &s;ay little more than this, That the <HI>Dutch</HI> had not done what we expected, and the Hou&s;e did not think fit, however, to take off the Prohibition on our Side, and in this Po&s;ture it &s;tands for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>About this Time, to make a &s;hort Digre&s;&s;ion, a Truce was made with the Emperor of <HI>Morocco,</HI> which, as it relates to Trade, I think may well be call'd an Affair of the Admini&s;tration at home; the Rea&s;on and Negotiation of this Truce may be too tedious to enter into here, but the Truce it&s;elf is material, e&s;pecially becau&s;e it afterwards broke out into a War, and is as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><Q>&startq;I. It is con&s;ented and agreed upon, that there be a firm and inviolable Truce between the mo&s;t &s;erene and potent Prince, <HI>George,</HI> King of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> &amp;c. and the mo&s;t powerful and noble Prince <HI>Maley I&s;mael,</HI> &amp;c. for Three Months from the Date hereof; and between the Dominions and Subjects, Ships and Imbarkations of both Nati|ons; and during the &s;aid Term no Injury &s;hall

be offered from one to the other by Word or Deed; but on the contrary they &s;hall treat one the other&endq; with all po&s;&s;ible Re&s;pect and Friend&s;hip.</Q></P>
<P N="2"><Q>&startq;II. That all the Ships, or any Imbarkations what&s;oever, as well tho&s;e which belong to his Britannick Maje&s;ty and his Subjects, as tho&s;e which belong to the Emperor of <HI>Morocco</HI> and his Va&s;&s;als, &s;hall pa&s;s the Seas freely, and without the lea&s;t Mole&s;tation, &s;hewing their Colours to each other. And if either one or the other &s;hall order their Boat aboard, there &s;hall not go in her above two Per&s;ons be&s;ides tho&s;e that Row, and tho&s;e two only, &s;hall be permitted to go on board the other Ship: And when they are &s;atis|fied that the major Part of the Ships Company are Subjects either of one or the other Prince, they &s;hall permit them to pa&s;s without any Mo|le&s;tation; as al&s;o all Pa&s;&s;engers, Money or Mer|chandize, that &s;hall belong to any Nation what|&s;oever, and &s;hall be found on board the &s;aid Ships or Imbarkations, &s;hall be intirely free, neither &s;hall they be &s;ubject to be taken, detained, or plundered, nor &s;hall one or the other receive any&endq; Damage or Injury.</Q></P>
<P N="3"><Q>&startq;III. It is farther agreed upon, that during the Term of the &s;aid Truce, no Ship or Imbarkation, either of the one or the other Part, or any of their Subjects that &s;hall be &s;hipwreck'd on the Coa&s;t of the Dominions of either the one or the other Prince, &s;hall be made Prize; neither &s;hall their Goods be taken, or er&s;ons made Slaves. But this Truce does not take off the Prohibition of Commerce; but the &s;ame is to remain in full&endq; Force, to the Conclu&s;ion of the general Peace.</Q></P>

<P>This put &s;ome End for a Time to the Rovers of <HI>Sallee,</HI> tho' they &s;oon broke out again: But the Irruption of our <HI>We&s;t-Indian</HI> Pirates grew &s;till wor&s;e and wor&s;e, nor will the Limits of this Hi|&s;tory extend to bring us an Account of any Abate|ment of their Rapine and Violence, but rather the Encrea&s;e of it.</P>
<P>It is certain, that this wicked In&s;urrection was begun by <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> and even now, the greate&s;t Part of the Pyrates are <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> tho' a great many <HI>French</HI> from <HI>Martinico</HI> have join'd them at &s;everal times &s;ince, and &s;ome Run-away Negroes al&s;o from <HI>Jamaica.</HI> Their fir&s;t Irruption was from <HI>Jamaica,</HI> but in private, and they never came to any con|&s;iderable Head, till &s;ome People, tempted by Pro|fit, robb'd the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who had recover'd part of the Trea&s;ure of the Galleons lo&s;t in the Gulph of <HI>Florida,</HI> and finding that being return'd to <HI>Ja|maica,</HI> they could not be protected there, but that upon the Application to the Government there, they would be pro&s;ecuted, and perhaps hang'd, they took to Sea again, and have committed &s;ince that, the mo&s;t unnatural Violences again&s;t their own Coun|try that ever Pyrates did, for they have chiefly di|rected their Robberies again&s;t the Ships and Mer|chants of their own Nation.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Commons, upon the Petition and Repre&s;entation of the Merchants, took this Part in|to Con&s;ideration, and ordered an Account to
<PB N="211" REF="476">
be given them of what Men of War are already in tho&s;e Parts, in order (as I &s;uppo&s;e) to con&s;ider what other Ships to &s;end thither; and the King, we are told, has Commi&s;&s;ion'd Captain <HI>Rogers,</HI> the &s;ame, who, as it is &s;aid of Sir <HI>Francis Drake,</HI> gir|dled the World, and took the Ships from <HI>Acapulco.</HI></P>
<P>Captain <HI>Rogers</HI> was now commi&s;&s;ion'd to go in Search of tho&s;e Robbers; and has taken with him three Men of War; and that he may make u&s;e of all the po&s;&s;ible Methods for reducing them, carries the King's Proclamation of Pardon to tho&s;e who will return to their Duty.</P>
<P>What Succe&s;s this Gentleman will meet with, or what other Remedies may be applied by the Par|liament for this Evil, I cannot yet &s;ee; but I fear this Wound will not be &s;o &s;oon healed as all the Friends to Trade de&s;ire.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> arm again&s;t them as well as we; and indeed the U&s;age which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> give them is very ju&s;t, whether it will intimidate and terrify them, or harden and make them de&s;perate, we cannot an&s;wer: But the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have &s;par'd none that have fallen into their Hands. One Crew of Sixty Seven they took by meer Fighting, and tyed the Men Back to Back, and threw them all into the Sea. Another Ve&s;&s;el they fir'd, and when the Men leap'd into the Sea to avoid the Fire, refu&s;ed to &s;ave any one of them. And a third that they took, they cut them all to Pieces, refu&s;ing to give them any Quarter. Nor are the Pyrates behind hand with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> whom they &s;erve in the very &s;ame Manner.</P>
<P>As for our Part, we do not hear yet of any of 'em that have fallen into the Hands of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Government except one Ship, which was ca&s;t away in <HI>New-England;</HI> of the Men, one hundred and
<PB N="212" REF="477">
ten were drown'd, and only Six &s;av'd, Five of which Six were hang'd, and the Sixth proving that he was taken by the Pirates; and was only a Pri&s;oner on board, and not engag'd with them, was &s;av'd.</P>
<P>In the mean time, they do a World of Mi&s;chief, and every Po&s;t or Expre&s;s from the I&s;lands or Conti|nent, brings us Account of Ships and Men taken, murder'd, or plunder'd by them; among which, the <HI>South Sea Company</HI> have the Misfortune to lo&s;e a &s;tout Ship, and very Rich, coming home from <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> which be&s;ides other Goods, had as they report, Four hundred thou&s;and Pieces of Eight on board, the Men having, it &s;eems, fought the Pyrates a good while, were, when they were forc'd to yield, all murder'd to a Man; and that which is &s;till more, the Pirates have by this means gotten a &s;tout Man of War, able to carry, as they write, 44 Guns.</P>
<P>Since this we have an Account, that the Pyrates cruize among the I&s;lands openly, &s;o that no Ship can &s;tir; and in particular, the I&s;lands of <HI>Nevis</HI> and <HI>Antegoa</HI> are, as it were, block'd up with them, and reduc'd thereby to the utmo&s;t Di&s;tre&s;s for want of Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>People have entertained &s;ome Hopes that the new Governour of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> Sir <HI>Nicholas Laws,</HI> who is lately enter'd upon his Government, and is a Per&s;on in particular acquainted with the Affairs and Inte|re&s;ts of tho&s;e Parts, having re&s;ided Forty Years in that I&s;land, will be able to direct to &s;ome Methods, how to reduce the&s;e de&s;perate People, either by fair or foul means, to their Duty; and I hear he is par|ticularly in&s;tructed for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>But I return to the Parliament, who were now drawing towards a Clo&s;e of their Se&s;&s;ion; abundance of Bills had pa&s;s'd thro' their Hands, which lay in
<PB N="213" REF="478">
the Hou&s;e of Lords for the Royal A&s;&s;ent, &s;o many, that the Hou&s;e of Commons having little Bu&s;ine&s;s, were oblig'd to adjourn for &s;ome Time, to give the Lords Time to go thro' the Work that was before them: In this Interval They voted to give the Bank of <HI>England</HI> Notice, that they would redeem and pay off the Sum of <HI>76803 l. 15 s. per Annum,</HI> pay|able to the &s;aid Bank for circulating Exchequer Bills; this was done, and the Notice order'd to be given the Bank, pur&s;uant to a Contract with the Bank, that they &s;hould have a Year's Notice, before &s;uch Sums were to be paid off.</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erv'd, that upon this Notice, the Stocks fell immediately Two or Three <HI>per Cent.</HI> which by the way, is a Te&s;timony of the prepo&s;te|rous Principles of Stock-Jobbing, <HI>viz.</HI> that they &s;hould value their publick Stocks and Funds at le&s;s than before, upon an Occa&s;ion, which in it &s;elf, manife&s;tly tends to Rai&s;ing and E&s;tabli&s;hing the Publick Credit, upon which all their Funds depend; but that is by the way, for this is not the only vi&s;ible Contradiction that is to be found in <HI>Stock-Jobbing.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ame <HI>17th</HI> Day of the Month, when the Speaker made this Report, the King &s;ent the fol|lowing Me&s;&s;age to the Hou&s;e, a Me&s;&s;age which, as it &s;eem'd to imply the u&s;ing a greater Strength than was intended in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> gave many People new Ideas of the Situation of Affairs between the <HI>Spaniard</HI> and Us; nor did the Notions of a War with <HI>Spain,</HI> which many People appre|hended as the Con&s;equence of the&s;e things add at all to the ri&s;e of our Stock.

<P>It was about this time that the famous <HI>James Shepheard</HI> appeared upon the Stage, this was a Youth who has been the A&s;toni&s;hment of the World upon many Accounts, having without any View, or for ought that yet appears without any Support, any Accomplices or any Con&s;piracy, openly profe&s;st a fixt Re&s;olution to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate The King, how he with a voluntary Boldne&s;s upon all Examination be|fore at and after his Tryal declared it, yielded to Death, courted no Favour, ask'd no Mercy, and with an unmov'd Courage look'd Death in the Face to the la&s;t Ga&s;p, tho' all Men know, not one can account for.</P>

<PB N="220" REF="485">
with Con&s;tables, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to &s;earch his Hou&s;e on Pre|tence of other Things, and &s;o find this Paper there. But this was a weak Part in him too, for had he carried the Letter it &s;elf to the Ju&s;tice of Peace, as he did an Account that he had received it, he had been right, and at the &s;ame time had been &s;afe too; whereas, as it was circum&s;tanced, he would cer|tainly have been very much reflected on for burning the Letter, had not the Boy clear'd up all the Ca&s;e by an unexampled Conduct.</P>
<P>For the Boy coming, as he had appointed, for an An&s;wer to the Letter, was apprehended and car|ried before a Magi&s;trate of the City of <HI>London</HI> &s;where he not only own'd the Letter, but the Trea, &s;on contain'd in it, and offer'd to write it over|again, which he did too in their Pre&s;ence, &s;etting his Hand to't, and thereby &s;igning his own De&s;truction; declaring to them all, that his Intention was to kill the King, and that he believ'd the Action would be meritorious if he had executed it; Things which nothing but a Lunatick could, till this Creature ap|pear'd, be &s;uppo&s;ed capable of.</P>
<P>It is too long to repeat all the&s;e Things as they pa&s;s'd in the &s;everal Examinations of this young Man, as well before the Ju&s;tice, as before the Un|der-Secretaries at the Secretaries Office, all which were repeated at his Tryal; but 'tis &s;ufficient to &s;ay, he was the &s;ame every where, readily own'd all, and that he meant and intended it all, and would do it &s;till if it were in his Power; and this he did, not only at tho&s;e &s;everal Examinations, but even upon his Tryal, and to the la&s;t; offering nothing in his Defence, refu&s;ing to call any Wit|ne&s;&s;es, but telling the Court he own'd every Thing that was depos'd by the Witne&s;&s;es, and that he in|tended and meant what he had written; and thus
<PB N="221" REF="486">
he receiv'd the Sentence of Death, &s;hewing no more Concern than at his fir&s;t Examination.</P>
<P>It was a&s;toni&s;hing to &s;ee the Conduct of this Youth! What A&s;&s;i&s;tants or In&s;tructors he had been furni&s;hed with, to bring him to receive &s;uch Prin+ciples, and to be &s;o fix'd in them, as to contemn Puni&s;hment, and we may &s;ay, to court the Grave and the Gallows, is hard to determine; nor per|haps, if any &s;uch are in Being, may they be even di&s;cover'd; for to pre&s;s him to tell, who boldly defied Death, and took all upon him&s;elf at the Price of his Life, had been to do nothing.</P>
<P>But to come now to his Execution: It was thought by &s;ome, the nearer View of Death would perhaps move him, and that when he &s;aw Death ju&s;t before his Eyes he would relent: But they were deceiv'd who entertain'd &s;uch Notions if him; for no Man in the World, had his Cau&s;e been indi&s;putably Good, could have brav'd Death it &s;elf, in a manner, more like a Chri&s;tian and a Hero, and yet died a Murtherer; that is to &s;ay, intentionally &s;o, and this, without the lea&s;t yield|ing the thing it &s;elf to be a Sin.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Day in the Morning that this Youth &s;uffer'd, a remarkable Piece of Ju&s;tice was executed upon an <HI>Italian</HI> Nobleman, the Marqui&s;s <HI>de Pal|leotti,</HI> Brother to the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> for killing his own Servant. The Murther committed was &s;o barbarous, the Provocation &s;o little, and the Conduct of the Per&s;on &s;o &s;candalous, that the Government did not think fit to give him the Fa|vour of a Per&s;on of Quality, <HI>viz.</HI> of being Be|headed; but this was all he obtain'd, <HI>viz.</HI> to be Hang'd about Six a-Clock in the Morning, and to be buried afterwards in St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s Church-yard.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="487">
He made a &s;hort kind of Speech in <HI>Italian,</HI> and gave it to the Sheriff at the Place of Execution.

<P>As now I draw near to that Part of the King's Hi&s;tory which relates to Foreign Affairs, I mu&s;t clear up &s;uch of the Tran&s;actions of the particular Year I am upon, as though relating to Foreign Af|fairs, yet were managed at Home; and this in par|ticular re&s;pects the Neutrality of <HI>Italy,</HI> and the Pro|ceedings
<PB N="223" REF="488">
of the King of <HI>Spain</HI> again&s;t the Domini|ons of the Emperor in <HI>Italy,</HI> a Subject which will take up much Room in the future Story of the Reign of King <HI>George,</HI> as well as in the General Hi&s;tory of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>It cannot be que&s;tioned, but that upon the ap|pearance of a Rupture between the King of <HI>Spain</HI> and the Emperor, two Powers which bore &s;o con&s;i|derable a Figure in <HI>Europe,</HI> the Neighbouring Po|tentates would concern them&s;elves to prevent the Con&s;equences of &s;uch a Breach, and more particu|larly the King of <HI>Great Britain;</HI> but it was for &s;ome Time not known by what Mea&s;ures or Me|thods his Maje&s;ty would think fit to act; the mo&s;t that was to be gather'd, was from the King's Words to the Parliament, in the Speech mention'd above.</P>
<P>As for the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> he having declined to accept of the&s;e Heads of Agreement, or of &s;uch o|thers as are &s;ettled among the other Powers, &s;uppo|&s;ing them to differ from the&s;e; the King of <HI>Great Britain</HI> has &s;ince entred in to &s;uch other Alliances and Conventions with the Emperour and <HI>France</HI> for the enforcing them; which Conventions and Alliances have been fini&s;hed &s;ince the Conclu&s;ion of the&s;e An|nals, as we&s;hall perhaps &s;ee in a little Time: The <HI>Spaniards</HI> will be obliged to comply with.</P>
<P>I find little more of Con&s;equence in the whole Four Years of this Reign, except what will come of Cour&s;e to be &s;poken of again in the following Years as we go on; (as for Example) the End of that prepo&s;terous Fewd among the Clergy, I mean the Bi&s;hop of <HI>B</HI>&mdash;'s Adherents and Antagoni&s;ts: This, I &s;ay, if ever it &s;hall come to an End, may once for all be &s;um'd up in a general Head, containing the Source of the Quarrel, the &s;candalous Manner of
<PB N="224" REF="489">
carrying it on, the Parties to it on either or on every Side, the Con&s;equences of it to them&s;elves and others, and the End of it all, with an Account who had the Victory, and what has been gained or lo&s;t. All the&s;e, I &s;ay, may be taken Notice of under one Article at la&s;t, but to engage in it now, is but to leave it the &s;ame unfini&s;hed Broil, and the &s;ame Piece of Confu&s;ion that we find it.</P>
<P>There had been, as is ob&s;erved before, a little Tu|mult in the We&s;t of <HI>England</HI> among the Clot hiers which &s;ome of our Writers would willingly have made a Rebellion of if they could, but if fell at once as it began without much De&s;ign, a few of the mo&s;t boy&s;terous being taken hold of, were kept in Pri&s;on and brought to Tryal at the Lent A&s;&s;izes this Year; the I&s;&s;ue of which was only this, that one <HI>Read</HI> the Leader or En&s;ign of the Mob was find 100 Nobles and Six Months Impri&s;onment, another of them 10 Nobles and Five Months Impri&s;onment, Four or Five other le&s;&s;er Sums, from 30 to 15 No|bles proportioned to their Guilt and their Capacities of Payment, and &s;o that Affair ended.</P>
<P>One of the principal Things remaining and with which I &s;hall clo&s;e this Hi&s;tory as to home Affairs, is the Account of the Lord <HI>Chancellor Cowper</HI> who now lay'd down the Seals, and of placing the Lord <HI>Parker</HI> in the Office of Lord High Chancellor of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>Among the many Per&s;ons on whom the Eyes of the Government &s;eem'd to be fix'd for this Employ, the Lord <HI>Parker,</HI> at that time Lord Chief Ju&s;tice of the <HI>King's Bench,</HI> was found to be the only Per&s;on in view; yet &s;ome Difficulties being nece&s;&s;ary to be adju&s;ted in removing a Per&s;on &s;eated in &s;uch a Po&s;t, as that of Lord Chief Ju&s;tice of <HI>England,</HI> it was &s;ome time that we were uncertain whether his Lord|&s;hip
<PB N="225" REF="490">
would be the Man or no. At length, <HI>viz.</HI> the 12th, we were put out of Doubt, the King gave the Seals to my Lord <HI>Parker,</HI> and he was declared Lord High Chancellor: What the Con&s;iderations by way of Equivalent were, on which his Lord|&s;hip quitted &s;o advantagious and &s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed a Po&s;t as that of Lord Chief Ju&s;tice, we cannot de|termine, tho' great Sums were talked of; all we find vi&s;ible is, that a Patent is &s;aid to be pa&s;&s;ed, or pa&s;&s;ing the Seals, to &s;ettle a Pen&s;ion of <HI>1200 l. per Annum</HI> upon his Lord&s;hip's elde&s;t Son; and it is added, that he is to have the Office of a Teller in the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> upon the fir&s;t Vacancy.</P>

<P>WHEN King <HI>George</HI> came to the Crown he found the Nation ju&s;t taking Breath after a tedious, wa&s;ting and bloody War; what|ever Complaints were at home again&s;t it, and the Conditions of the Peace of <HI>&V;trecht,</HI> the Man|ner of making it, and the Per&s;ons employed in it, yet this Happine&s;s accured to his Maje&s;ty by it, and of which all the Kingdom &s;hared with him <HI>(viz.)</HI> that when Providence called the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hannover</HI> to the Succe&s;&s;ion, the Hands of all their Enemies were tied up by the very Peace which them&s;elves had made,
<PB N="230" REF="495">
&s;o that not the lea&s;t Oppo&s;ition was any where offered to the quiet Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Crown at home or abroad.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>France,</HI> the mo&s;t potent Enemy to the Prote&s;tant Settlement, was engaged by Treaty and bound in Honour, not only not to oppo&s;e it, but even to contribute to the free and uninterrupted Acce&s;&s;ion, and accordingly ordered Mon&s;ieur <HI>Ibberville,</HI> his Mini&s;ter at <HI>London,</HI> and the Marque&s;s <HI>de Cha&s;teauneuf,</HI> his Mini&s;ter at the <HI>Hague,</HI> to &s;ignifie, the fir&s;t to the Regency of <HI>London,</HI> and the other to the Mini&s;ters of <HI>Hannover</HI> and <HI>Great Britain</HI> at the <HI>Hague,</HI> that his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Ma|je&s;ty would offer his <HI>Britannick</HI> Maje&s;ty no Di|&s;turbance in his Acce&s;&s;ion to the Crown; and when his Maje&s;ty afterwards came to the <HI>Hague</HI> in his way to <HI>England,</HI> the &s;ame <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;|&s;ador waited on him, and in the Name of his Ma&s;ter, the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, congratulated his Acce&s;&s;ion, paid the Compliment as they cal|led it of Febicitation, and gave him the &s;ame A&s;&s;urances in Words at length; &s;o in a Word the Peace of <HI>&V;trecht</HI> had &s;topped every Mouth, and tied every Hand from acting again&s;t the In|tere&s;t and advancing of King <HI>George</HI> to the Throne, a Circum&s;tance which in my Account would have atoned for abundance of the bad Things which otherwi&s;e, as they &s;ay, attended the Peace.</P>
<P>But the People of that Side &s;hut their Eyes again&s;t this Part, nor did they abate any Thing of their Complaints again&s;t the Peace it &s;elf, any more than they did again&s;t the Per&s;ons who made it, as has been &s;hewn in the forego|ing Sheets.</P>

As the whole World was thus at Peace with King <HI>George</HI> and his Acce&s;&s;ion, &s;o King <HI>George</HI> evi|dently de&s;ired to be at Peace with all the World, and it was his Maje&s;ty's Intere&s;t to be, con&s;ider|ing the Temper of his People and Situation of his Affairs at Home; and without doubt it was with a View to this that the King &s;o rea|dily entered into a defen&s;ive Alliance with the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Dutch,</HI> at a Time when &s;ome People here were not, for want of Ignorance, warm for renewing the War with <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Of this Alliance, the Nature and Rea&s;on of it, I have given a large Account in the &s;econd Part of this Hi&s;tory, Page 32, to which I refer.</P>
<P>From this to the Affairs of <HI>Spain</HI> our Admini|&s;tration has had little Concern; in the Affairs abroad, the World, though full of Intrigues and Embarra&s;&s;es, had little or no War upon their Hands, except that in the &s;econd Year of the King a bloody War broke out between the Empe|ror and the <HI>Turks,</HI> which indeed began in the Quarrel of the <HI>Venetians;</HI> for as to the War in the <HI>North,</HI> there was nothing done in it de&s;er|ving the Name of a War, except driving the <HI>Swedes</HI> to their clo&s;e Quarters; for as to the at|tacking them in their own Country, the Allies dur&s;t not venture upon it.</P>
<P>But the War with the <HI>Turks</HI> was carried on in earne&s;t, and the very fir&s;t Campaign Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> of <HI>Savoy,</HI> who commanded the <HI>Imperial</HI> Ar|my, gave the <HI>Turks</HI> an entire Overthrow in the great Battle near <HI>Semlin,</HI> or rather at <HI>Peterwa|radin$,</HI> where, if we may believe the Accounts which the <HI>Germans</HI> gave of it, they killed a|bove <HI>26000 Turks,</HI> took all their Baggage and Carriages, all their Tents, Trea&s;ure, and 150
<PB N="232" REF="497">
Pieces of Canon, and after that pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Da|nube</HI> and the <HI>They&s;&s;e,</HI> and laid Siege to <HI>Teme&s;waer,</HI> which after a long Siege they took al&s;o, with all the Di&s;trict and Dependency of it, as far as <HI>Or&s;owa</HI> on the <HI>Danube</HI> one way, and as far as the River <HI>Alauta</HI> the other way, even a good way into the Country of <HI>Wallachia.</HI></P>
