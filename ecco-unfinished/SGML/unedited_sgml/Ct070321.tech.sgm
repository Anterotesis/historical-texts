<HEAD>THE
INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Which the reader may, or may
not peru&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>THE world is &s;o taken up of
late with Novels and Ro|mances,
generally &s;pun from the
brains of needy authors, and often
very improbably related, that it will
be difficult for a real hi&s;tory, tho'
founded upon facts, to be taken for
genuine.</P>
<P>Laetitia Atkins, though vulgarly
called Moll Flanders, the heroine
<PB N="iv" REF="4">
of the following hi&s;tory, was as
beautiful a woman, and as fine a
figure, as any would de&s;ire to be|hold;
and from her conver&s;ation,
at the time &s;he produced me her
manu&s;cript, I imagined &s;he would
want but little of my a&s;&s;i&s;tance:
but, in that particular, I found
my error; for though &s;he had
received what is called a liberal
education, I mean for a woman,
yet, when &s;he came to expre&s;s her
thoughts upon paper, they were
delivered not with half that pro|priety,
which &s;he held in conver|&s;ation.</P>
<P>She told me that it was not only
written in her own hand, but
that there was not a &s;ingle inci|dent
would be found in her whole
&s;tory, but was really and literally
true; and indeed there are abun|dance,
and all of them u&s;efully
applied: there is al&s;o an agreeable
turn given them in the relating,
<PB N="v" REF="5">
that naturally in&s;tructs, and di|verts
the reader; yet, upon my
giving the book another reading,
&s;everal years after the publica|tion;
I was a&s;toni&s;hed to find I
had &s;uffered many circum&s;tances
to appear in print, which, though
they were true, upon a more cool
reflection, my judgment could not
by any means approve.</P>
<P>I therefore, &s;till keeping truth
in view, by never &s;uffering her to
e&s;cape my &s;ight, altered many parts
of it, to give it the better reading,
as I &s;ome little time before had
done by Roxana; or, the Fortu|nate
Mi&s;tre&s;s; in the doing of
which as I plea&s;ed my&s;elf, I have
the le&s;s doubt of plea&s;ing my read|ers
al&s;o.</P>
<P>That part of her life with her
young ma&s;ter, at Colche&s;ter, has
&s;o many happy turns given it to
expo&s;e the crime, and warn all,
who&s;e circum&s;tances are adapted to
<PB N="vi" REF="6">
it, of the ruinous end of &s;uch in|di&s;cretions,
and the thoughtle&s;s
and abhorred conduct of both the
parties, that it abundantly atones
for the de&s;cription &s;he gives of her
folly.</P>
<P>The repentance of her lover at
the Bath, and how brought by the
ju&s;t alarm of his fit of &s;ickne&s;s to
abandon her; the caution given
again&s;t even the lawful intimacies
of the deare&s;t friends, and how
unable they are to pre&s;erve the mo&s;t
&s;olemn re&s;olutions of virtue with|out
divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance; are parts,
which, to a ju&s;t di&s;cernment, will
appear to have more real beau|ty
in them, than all the amorous
romances that have ever been pub|li&s;hed.</P>
<P>Her application, and indu&s;trious
management at la&s;t in Virginia,
with her tran&s;ported hu&s;band, is
a &s;tory fruitful of in&s;truction, to
all who are obliged to &s;eek their
<PB N="vii" REF="7">
re-e&s;tabli&s;hment abroad; whether
by the mi&s;ery of tran&s;portation,
or other di&s;a&s;ter; letting them
know, that diligence and applica|tion
have their due encouragement,
even in the remote&s;t parts of the
world; that no ca&s;e can be &s;o
low, &s;o de&s;picable, or &s;o empty of
pro&s;pect, but that an unwearied
indu&s;try will go a great way to
deliver us from it, will in time
rai&s;e the meane&s;t creature to appear
again in the world, and give him a
new pro&s;pect for his life.</P>
<P>The&s;e are a few of the &s;erious
inferences which we are led by the
hand to in this book, and the&s;e
are fully &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify me
in recommending it to the world,
and much more to ju&s;tify the pub|lication
of it.</P>

<P>My father was an intimate ac|quaintance

I had frequently heard him &s;peak of

much, after my reading his Robin|&s;on

<HEAD>THE
HISTORY
OF
LAETITIA ATKINS,
Vulgarly called
MOLL FLANDERS.</HEAD>
<P>I Think it may, with great propriety,
be &s;aid, I met with a part of the
misfortunes of the world, before I came
into it, my father, Theophilus Atkins,
being dead, near &s;ix months, before I
was born.</P>
<P>My father was, by trade, a glazier
and painter, but he dying, leaving my
mother a widow in circum&s;tances but
indifferent, &s;he one evening, as a lady
was getting out of her coach at the
Opera-hou&s;e, was detected, in too great
a familiarity, with the lady's gold watch;
for which fact, at the Old Bailey, &s;he
received &s;entence of death; but, at that
<PB N="2" REF="10">
awful bar, pleading &s;he was with child,
was confined in Newgate, until &s;he was
delivered of me; afterwards her &s;en|tence
was changed to be tran&s;ported for
her natural life, and &s;he was according|ly
&s;ent to Virginia.</P>
<P>Having an aunt, &s;i&s;ter to my father,
living at Colche&s;ter in credit, &s;he edu|cated
and maintained me in a genteel
manner, until I arrived to the age of
eighteen; &s;he dying and leaving me her
effects, application was made to me by
an elderly lady of the place, an ac|quaintance
of my late aunt, to wait on
two of her elde&s;t daughters.</P>
<P>Here I had all the advantages for im|proving
my education that could be
imagined; for the ladies had their &s;eve|ral
ma&s;ters who came to the hou&s;e to
teach them; and as I was always with
them, though the ma&s;ters were not ap|pointed
to teach me, yet I retained by
intimation and inquiry all that they learn|ed
by in&s;truction and direction. So that,
as the ladies &s;aid, I danced and &s;poke
French better than they did, and as I
had a finer pipe, I Tung better too, and
had been u&s;ed to the harp&s;icord. By
<PB N="3" REF="11">
this means I had all the advantages that
I could have de&s;ired, if I had been their
equal in point of fortune.</P>
<P>I had with all the&s;e the common va|nity
of my &s;ex. Being really taken for
a great beauty, I had as good an opi|nion
of my&s;elf, as any body el&s;e could
have of me; and particularly I loved to
hear any body &s;peak of it; which could
not but happen &s;ometimes, and was a
great &s;atisfaction to me.</P>
<P>Thus far I have had a &s;mooth &s;tory
to tell of my&s;elf, and in this part of my
life, I not only had the reputation of
living in a very good family, re&s;pected
every where for virtue and &s;obriety; but
I had the character too of a very &s;ober,
mode&s;t, and virtuous young woman;
and &s;uch I had always been, neither had
I yet any occa&s;ion to think of any thing
el&s;e, or to know what a temptation to
wickedne&s;s meant.</P>
<P>But that which I was too vain of, was
my ruin. The lady in the hou&s;e where
I was, had al&s;o two &s;ons, young gentle|men
of very promi&s;ing parts and of ex|traordinary
behaviour; and it was my
misfortune to be agreeable to them both,
<PB N="4" REF="12">
but they managed them&s;elves with me in
a quite different manner.</P>
<P>The elde&s;t, a gay gentleman that
knew the town, as well as the country,
and though he had levity, yet had too
much judgment of things, to pay too
dear for his plea&s;ures; he began that
unhappy &s;nare to all women, taking no|tice
how pretty I was, how agreeable,
how well carriaged: he would contrive
to be talking this to his &s;i&s;ters, when
though I was not by, yet when he knew
I was not &s;o far off but that I &s;hould be
&s;ure to hear him. His &s;i&s;ters would re|turn
&s;oftly to him, &startq;Hu&s;h brother, Let|ty
will hear you, &s;he is but in the next
room.&endq; Then he would put it off, and
talk &s;oftlier, as if he had not known
it, and to acknowledge he was wrong;
and as if he had forgot him&s;elf, he
would &s;peak aloud again, and I was
&s;o well plea&s;ed to hear it, was &s;ure to
li&s;ten for it on all occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>One day, he going by his &s;i&s;ter's cham|ber
when I was dre&s;&s;ing her, he comes
in with an air of gaiety, &startq;O! Letty,
don't your cheeks burn?&endq; I made a
curt&s;ey, and blu&s;h'd, but &s;aid nothing.
<PB N="5" REF="13">
&startq;What makes you talk &s;o, brother?&endq;
&s;ays the lady. &startq;Why,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;we
have been talking of her below-&s;tairs
this half-hour.&endq; &startq;Well,&endq; &s;ays his &s;i&s;|ter,
&startq;you can &s;ay no harm of her, that I
am &s;ure, &s;o it is no matter what you
have been talking about.&endq; &startq;Nay,&endq;
&s;ays he, &startq;it is &s;o far from &s;aying any
harm of her, that we have been talking
a great deal of good, and a great many
fine things have been &s;aid of Letty, I
a&s;&s;ure you; and particularly, that &s;he
is the hand&s;ome&s;t girl in Colche&s;ter.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I wonder at you, brother: Letty
wants but one thing, but &s;he had as
good want every thing, for the market
is again&s;t our &s;ex ju&s;t now; and if a
young woman have beauty, birth,
breeding, wit, &s;en&s;e, manners, mode&s;ty,
and all the&s;e to an extream; yet, if &s;he
have not money, &s;he is no-body, &s;he
had as good want them all, for nothing
but money now recommends a woman;
the men play the game all into their
own hands.&endq;</P>
<P>Her younger brother, who was by,
replied, &startq;Hold, &s;i&s;ter, you run too fa&s;t,
I am an exception to your rule; I a&s;|&s;ure
<PB N="6" REF="14">
you, if I find a woman &s;o accom|pli&s;hed
as you talk of, I would not
trouble my&s;elf about the money.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O,&endq; &s;ays the &s;i&s;ter, &startq;but you will
take care not to fancy one then, with|out
the money.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You don't know that neither,&endq; &s;ays
the younger brother.</P>
<P>&startq;But, why &s;i&s;ter,&endq; &s;ays the elder
brother, &startq;why do you &s;o exclaim at the
men, for aiming &s;o much at the for|tune?
you are none of them that want
a fortune, what ever el&s;e you may want.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I under&s;tand you, brother,&endq; replies
the lady very &s;martly, &startq;you &s;uppo&s;e I
have the money, and want the beauty;
but as times go now, the fir&s;t will do
without the la&s;t, &s;o I have the better of
my neighbours.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well,&endq; &s;ays the younger brother,
&startq;but your neighbours, as you call
them, may be even with you; for beau|ty
will &s;teal a hu&s;band &s;ometimes in &s;pite
of money; and when the maid chances
to be hand&s;omer than the mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;he
oftentimes makes as good a market, and
rides in a coach before her.&endq;</P>
<P>I thought it was time for me to with|draw,
<PB N="7" REF="15">
and leave them, and I did &s;o;
but not &s;o far, but that I heard their di&s;|cour&s;e,
in which I al&s;o heard abundance
of fine things &s;aid of my&s;elf, which
&s;erved to prompt my vanity; but, as I
&s;oon found, was not the way to increa&s;e
my intere&s;t in the family; for the &s;i&s;ter,
and the younger brother fell grievou&s;ly
out about it; and as he &s;aid &s;ome very
di&s;obliging things to her, upon my ac|count,
&s;o I could ea&s;ily &s;ee that &s;he
re&s;ented them, by her future conduct to
me, which indeed was very unju&s;t, for
I had never had the lea&s;t thought of
what &s;he &s;u&s;pected, as to her younger
brother: indeed, the elder had &s;aid a
great many things, as in je&s;t, which I
had the folly to believe were in earne&s;t,
or to flatter my&s;elf, with the hopes of
what I ought to have &s;uppo&s;ed he never
intended, and perhaps never thought of.</P>
<P>It happened one day that he came
running up &s;tairs, towards the room
where his &s;i&s;ters u&s;ed to &s;it and work, as
he often did, and calling to them be|fore
he came in, as was his way, I be|ing
there alone &s;tept to the door, and
&s;aid, &startq;Sir, the ladies are not here, they
<PB N="8" REF="16">
are walked down the garden.&endq; As I
&s;tept forward to &s;ay this, he was ju&s;t
got to the door, and cla&s;ping me in his
arms, as if it had been by chance, &startq;O!
Mrs. Letty, are you here? I want to
&s;peak with you, more than I do with
them,&endq; and having me in his arms, he
ki&s;&s;ed me &s;everal times.</P>
<P>I &s;truggled to get away, yet he held
me fa&s;t, and &s;till ki&s;&s;ed me till he was
almo&s;t out of breath: and then &s;itting
down, &s;aid, &startq;My dear Letty I am in
love with you.&endq;</P>
<P>His words, I mu&s;t confe&s;s fired my
blood, my &s;pirits flew about my heart,
and put me into di&s;order, which he
might ea&s;ily have &s;een in my face; he
repeated it &s;everal times, that he was in
love with me, and though my heart
fluttered, I confe&s;s I was &s;ecretly plea&s;ed
with his expre&s;&s;ions; however nothing
further pa&s;&s;ed at that time, it was but
a &s;urpri&s;e, and when he had left me, I
&s;oon recovered my&s;elf; and had there
not been one &s;mall misfortune in it, I
had been in the right; but the mi&s;take
lay here, that Mrs. Letty was in earne&s;t,
and the young gentleman was not.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="17">
It was not long, before he found an
opportunity to catch me again. The
young ladies were gone a vi&s;iting with
their mother; his brother was out of
town, and as for his father, he had been
at London a week; he had &s;o well
watched me, that he knew where I was,
though I did not &s;o much as know that
he was in the hou&s;e; he coming up
the &s;tairs, and &s;eeing me at work came
into the room, and began ju&s;t as he did
before with taking me in his arms, and
ki&s;&s;ing me.</P>
<P>It was his younger &s;i&s;ter's chamber
that I was in, and as there was nobody
in the hou&s;e, but the maids below ftairs:
he taking this advantage, he threw me
down upon the bed; but he offered no
other rudene&s;s than ki&s;&s;ing me.</P>
<P>I &s;truggled, and told him &s;omebody
was coming, upon which he lifted me
up, profe&s;&s;ing a great deal of love, that
it was an hone&s;t affection, and he meant
no ill to me: &s;aying this, he put five
guineas into my hand, and immediately
left me.</P>
<P>I am the more particular in this part,
that when my &s;tory comes to be read, by
<PB N="10" REF="18">
tho&s;e of my own &s;ex, they may learn
from it to guard them&s;elves again&s;t the
mi&s;chiefs which attend an early know|ledge
of their own beauty: for when a
young woman once thinks her&s;elf hand|&s;ome,
The never doubts the truth of any
man, that tells her he is in love with
her; for if the believes her&s;elf charm|ing
enough to captivate him, it is natu|ral
to expect the effects of it.</P>
<P>This young gentleman had fired his
inclination, as much as he had fired my
vanity; and as if he had found that he
had an opportunity, and was &s;orry he
did not improve it, he, pre&s;ently, came
up again, telling me how pa&s;&s;ionately he
loved me, and that though he could not
mention &s;uch a thing, till he came to
his e&s;tate, yet he was re&s;olved to make
me happy then, and him&s;elf too by his
marrying me.</P>
<P>We had not &s;at long, but he got up,
and &s;topping my breath with ki&s;&s;es, he
again threw me upon the bed; and here,
I confe&s;s, he went farther with me than
decency permits me to mention.</P>
<P>However, though he took the&s;e free|doms,
it did not go to that, which they
<PB N="11" REF="19">
call the la&s;t favour, which, to do him
ju&s;tice, he did not attempt; and he
made that &s;elf-denial of his, a plea for
all his freedoms with me upon other oc|ca&s;ions
after. When this was over, he
&s;taid but a little while, and left me;
making a thou&s;and prote&s;tations of his
pa&s;&s;ion for me, and of his loving me
above all the women in the world.</P>
<P>Nothing &s;ure was ever &s;o &s;tupid. Had I
acted as became me, and re&s;i&s;ted as virtue
and honour required, this gentleman,
had either de&s;i&s;ted his attacks, finding
no room to expect the accompli&s;hment of
his de&s;ign, or had made fair and ho|nourable
propo&s;als of marriage; in
which ca&s;e, whoever had blamed him,
nobody could have blamed me. If I
had known his mind, and how hard he
thought I would be to be gained. I
might have made my own terms with
him; and if I had not capitulated for an
immediate marriage, I might for a main|tenance
till marriage, and might have
had what I would; for he was already
rich to exce&s;s, be&s;ides what he had in
expectation; but I wholly abandoned
all &s;uch thoughts and was taken up only
<PB N="12" REF="20">
with the pride of my beauty, and of
my being beloved.</P>
<P>In the mean time, however, I did
not give room to any in the family to
&s;u&s;pect me, or to imagine that I had the
lea&s;t corre&s;pondence with this young
gentleman; I &s;carce ever looked towards
him in publick, or an&s;wered if he &s;poke
to me, if any body was near us; but
for all that, we had every now and then
a little encounter, where we had room
for a word or two, and now and then a
ki&s;s.</P>
<P>But as the Devil is an unwearied
tempter, &s;o he never fails to find oppor|tunity
for that wickedne&s;s he invites to:
it was one evening that I was in the gar|den,
with his &s;i&s;ters, and him&s;elf, and
all very innocently merry, when he
found means to convey a note into my
hand, by which he directed me to un|der&s;tand,
that he would to-morrow de|fire
me publickly to go of an errand for
him into the town, and that I &s;hould &s;ee
him &s;omewhere by the way.</P>
<P>Accordingly after dinner, he very
gravely &s;ays to me, his &s;i&s;ters being by,
&startq;Letty, I mu&s;t a&s;k a favour of you.&endq;
<PB N="13" REF="21">
&startq;What's that?&endq; &s;ays his &s;econd &s;i&s;ter.&endq;
&startq;Nay, &s;i&s;ter,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;if you cannot
&s;pare Mrs. Letty to-day, any other time
will do.&endq; Yes, they &s;aid, they could
&s;pare her well enough, and the &s;i&s;ter beg|ged
pardon for a&s;king. &startq;Well, but bro|ther,&endq;
&s;ays the elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, &startq;you mu&s;t
tell Letty what it is; if it be any private
bu&s;ine&s;s, that we mu&s;t not hear, you
may call her out, there &s;he is.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Indeed, &s;i&s;ter, I have no private
bu&s;ine&s;s with Mrs. Letty;&endq; and when
he had given me my in&s;tructions, he
told them a long &s;tory of a vi&s;it he was
going to make to a family they all knew,
and where was to be &s;uch and &s;uch gen|tlemen,
and how merry they were to be;
and very formally a&s;ked his &s;i&s;ters to go
with him, and they as formally excus'd
them&s;elves becau&s;e of company that
they had notice were to come and vi&s;it
them that afternoon, which, by the way,
he had contrived on purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>He had &s;carce done &s;peaking to them,
and given me my errand, but his man
came up to tell him, that Sir William's
chariot was at the door; &s;o he runs
down, and comes up again immediately,
<PB N="14" REF="22">
&startq;Alas!&endq; &s;ays he to his &s;i&s;ters, &startq;there's
all my mirth &s;poiled at once; Sir Wil|liam
has &s;ent his chariot for me, and
de&s;ires to &s;peak with me upon &s;ome ear|ne&s;t
bu&s;ine&s;s.&endq; It &s;eems Sir William
was a gentleman, who liv'd about three
miles out of town, to whom he had
&s;poken on purpo&s;e the day before, to
lend him his chariot for a particular oc|ca&s;ion;
and had appointed it to call for
him, as it did about three o'clock.</P>
<P>Immediately he calls for his hat and
&s;word, and ordered his man to go to the
other place to make his excu&s;e; that was
to &s;ay, he made an excu&s;e to &s;end his
man away, and prepares to go into the
chariot: as he was going he &s;topt, and
&s;peaks mighty earne&s;tly to me about his
bu&s;ine&s;s, and finds opportunity to &s;ay
very &s;oftly to me, &startq;Come away, Letty,
as &s;oon as you can.&endq; I &s;aid nothing,
but made a curt&s;ey, as if I had done &s;o
to what he had &s;aid in publick; in about
a quarter of an hour I went out too,
&s;o that there was not the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion
in the hou&s;e. He waited for me in the
chariot in a back lane, which he knew
I mu&s;t pa&s;s by, and directed the coach|man
<PB N="15" REF="23">
where to drive; which was to a
certain place, as I afterwards found,
where lived a confident of his, and
where was all the convenience he could
de&s;ire, to put in practice what he in|tended.</P>
<P>When we arrived at the hou&s;e, he be|gan
to talk very gravely to me, and to
tell me, he did not bring me there to
betray me; that his pa&s;&s;ion for me would
not &s;uffer him to abu&s;e me; that he re|&s;olved
to marry me as &s;oon as he came
to his e&s;tate, and in the mean time, if I
would grant him his reque&s;t, he would
maintain me very honourably, and made
me a thou&s;and prote&s;tations of his &s;ince|rity,
and of his affection, and that he
would never abandon me.</P>
<P>However, as he pre&s;&s;ed me to &s;peak,
I told him, I had no rea&s;on to que&s;tion
the &s;incerity of his love, after &s;o many
prote&s;tations, but&mdash;and there I
&s;topt; &startq;But, what, my dear? I gue&s;s
what you mean&mdash;if you &s;hould be with
child. &startq;Why then,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;I'll
take care and provide for you, and the
child too; and that you may &s;ee I am
not in je&s;t, here's an earne&s;t for you;&endq;
<PB N="16" REF="24">
and with that he pulls out a pur&s;e full of
gold, and gave it me; &startq;and I'll give
you &s;uch another every year till I marry
you.&endq;</P>
<P>Thus I fini&s;hed my own de&s;truction
at once: for from this day, being for&s;a|ken
of my virtue, I had nothing of
value left to recommend me either to
God's ble&s;&s;ing or man's a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>In about two hours I arrived at home
again; as for him he &s;taid out, as he
told me he would, till late at night, and
there was not the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion in the
family, either on his account or mine.</P>
<P>We had, after this, frequent opportu|nities
to repeat our crime; chiefly by
his contrivance, e&s;pecially at home, when
his mother and the young ladies went
abroad a vi&s;iting, which he watched &s;o
narrowly as never to mi&s;s, knowing al|ways
before-hand when they went out,
and then failed not to catch me alone,
and this for near half a year; and yet,
which was the mo&s;t to my &s;atisfaction,
I was not with child.</P>
<P>Before the half year was expired, his
younger brother, of whom I have made
&s;ome mention, finding me alone in the
garden one evening, begins a &s;tory of
<PB N="17" REF="25">
the &s;ame kind, made hone&s;t profe&s;&s;ions
of being in love, and in &s;hort, propo&s;ed
fairly and honourably to marry me.</P>
<P>I was now confounded and driven to
&s;uch an extremity, as the like was never
known; at lea&s;t not to me. I re&s;i&s;ted
the propo&s;al with ob&s;tinacy, and now I
began to arm my&s;elf with arguments:
I laid before him the inequality of the
match; the treatment I &s;hould meet with
in the family; the ingratitude it would
be to his good father and mother, who
had taken me into their hou&s;e upon &s;uch
generous principles; in &s;hort, I &s;aid
every thing to di&s;&s;uade him from his
de&s;ign that I could imagine, except tell|ing
him the truth, which would indeed
have put an end to it all, but that I
dur&s;t not think of mentioning.</P>
<P>But here happened a circum&s;tance
that I did not expect, which put me to
my &s;hifts; for this young gentleman as
he was plain and hone&s;t, &s;o he pretend|ed
to nothing with me, but what was &s;o
too; and knowing his own innocence,
he was not &s;o careful to make his hav|ing
a kindne&s;s for me a &s;ecret in the
hou&s;e, as his brother was; and though
<PB N="18" REF="26">
he did not let them know that he had
talked to me about it, yet he &s;aid enough
to let his &s;i&s;ters perceive he liked me,
and his mother &s;aw it too, which tho'
they took no notice of it to me, yet
they did to him, and immediately I
found their carriage to me altered, more
than ever before.</P>
<P>I &s;aw the cloud, though I did not
fore&s;ee the &s;torm. It was ea&s;y to &s;ee
their carriage to me was altered, and
that it grew wor&s;e and wor&s;e every day;
till at la&s;t, I got information among the
&s;ervants, that I &s;hould, in a very little
while, be de&s;ired to remove.</P>
<P>I was not alarmed at the news, hav|ing
a full &s;atisfaction that I &s;hould be
otherwi&s;e provided for; and e&s;pecially,
con&s;idering that I had rea&s;on every day
to expect I &s;hould be with child, and
that then I &s;hould be obliged to remove
without any pretences for it.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time, the younger gentle|man
took an opportunity to tell me,
that the kindne&s;s he had for me, had
got vent in the family. He did not
charge me with it, he &s;aid, for he
knew well enough which way it came
<PB N="19" REF="27">
out; he told me his plain way of talk|ing
had been the occa&s;ion of it, for that
he did not make his re&s;pect for me &s;o
much a &s;ecret as he might have done,
and the rea&s;on was, if I would con&s;ent
to have him, he would tell them all
openly he loved me, and that he intend|ed
to marry me: that it was true his
father and mother might re&s;ent it, and
be unkind; but that he was now in a
way to live, being bred to the law, and
he did not fear maintaining me, agreea|ble
to what I &s;hould expect; and, as he
believed I would not be a&s;hamed of
him, &s;o he was re&s;olved not to be afham|ed
of me; and that he &s;corned to be
afraid to own me now, who he re&s;olved
to own after I was his wife, and therefore
I had nothing to do but to give him my
hand, and he would an&s;wer for all the
re&s;t.</P>
<P>I was now in a dreadful condition in|deed.
And here I repented heartily my
ea&s;ine&s;s with the elde&s;t brother, not from
any reflection of con&s;cience, but from a
view of the happine&s;s I might have en|joyed,
and had now made impo&s;&s;ible:
for though I had no &s;cruples of con&s;ci|ence,
<PB N="20" REF="28">
as I have &s;aid, to &s;truggle with,
yet I could not think of being a mi&s;tre&s;s
to one brother and a wife to the other.
But then it came into my thoughts,
that the fir&s;t brother, had promi&s;ed to
make me his wife, when he came to
his e&s;tate; but I pre&s;ently remembered,
what I had often thought of, that he
had never &s;poken a word of having me
for a wife, after he had conquered me
for a mi&s;tre&s;s; and indeed till now, tho'
I &s;aid I thought of it often, yet it gave
me no di&s;turbance; for as he did not
&s;eem in the lea&s;t to le&s;&s;en his affection
to me, &s;o neither did he le&s;&s;en his boun|ty,
though he had the di&s;cretion him|&s;elf
to de&s;ire me not to lay out a &s;hill|ing
of what he gave me in cloaths, or to
make the lea&s;t &s;hew extraordinary, be|cau&s;e
it would nece&s;&s;arily give jealou&s;y
in the family.</P>
<P>But I was now in a great &s;trait, and
really knew not what to do. The main
difficulty was this; the younger brother
not only laid clo&s;e &s;iege to me, but &s;uf|fered
it to be &s;een; he would come into
his &s;i&s;ter's room, and his mother's room,
and &s;it down, and talk a thou&s;and kind
<PB N="21" REF="29">
things of me, and to me, even before
their faces, and when they were all
there: this grew &s;o publick, that the
whole hou&s;e talked of it, and his mo|ther
reproved him for it, and their car|riage
to me appeared quite altered: in
&s;hort, his mother had let fall &s;ome
&s;peeches, as if &s;he intended to put me out
of the family, that is, to turn me out
of doors. Now, I was &s;ure this could
not be a &s;ecret to his brother, only that
he might not think, as indeed nobody
el&s;e yet did, that the younge&s;t brother
had made any propo&s;als to me about it:
but as I ea&s;ily could &s;ee that it would go
farther, &s;o I &s;aw likewi&s;e there was an
ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity to &s;peak of it to him,
or that he would &s;peak of it to me; and
which to wait for I knew not.</P>
<P>Upon &s;erious con&s;ideration, for in|deed
now I began to con&s;ider things ve|ry
&s;eriou&s;ly, and never till now; I &s;ay,
upon &s;erious con&s;ideration, I re&s;olved to
tell him of it fir&s;t, and it was not long
before I had an opportunity: for the
very next day his brother went to Lon|don
upon &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s, and the family
being out a vi&s;iting, ju&s;t as it had hap|pened
<PB N="22" REF="30">
before, and as indeed was often
the ca&s;e, he came according to his cu&s;|tom
to &s;pend an hour or two with
me.</P>
<P>When he had &s;at down a while, he
perceived there was an alteration in my
countenance, that I was not &s;o free and
plea&s;ant with him, as I u&s;ed to be, and
particularly that I had been a crying;
he was not long before he took notice of
it, and a&s;ked me in very kind terms
what was the matter, and if any thing
troubled me: I would have put it off if
I could, but it was not to be concealed;
&s;o after &s;uffering many importunities to
draw that out of me, which I longed as
much as po&s;&s;ible to di&s;clo&s;e; I told him
that it was true, &s;omething did trouble
me, and &s;omething of &s;uch a nature,
that I could not tell how to acquaint
him with it; that it was a thing that not
only &s;urpri&s;ed me, but greatly perplex|ed
me, and that I knew not what cour&s;e
to take, unle&s;s he would direct me. He
told me with great tenderne&s;s, that let
it be what it would, I &s;hould not let it
trouble me, for he would protect me
from all the world.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="31">
I then began at a di&s;tance, and told
him I was afraid the ladies had got &s;ome
&s;ecret information of our corre&s;pond|ence;
for that it was ea&s;y to &s;ee, that
their conduct was very much changed
towards me, and now it was come to
that pa&s;s, that they frequently found
fault with me, though I never gave
them the lea&s;t occa&s;ion: that whereas,
I u&s;ed always to lay with the elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter,
I was lately put to lay by my&s;elf, or
with one of the maids; and that I had
over-heard them &s;everal times talking
very unkindly about me; but that
which confirmed it all, was, one of the
&s;ervants had told me, &s;he had heard I
was to be turned out, and that it was not
&s;afe for the family, that I &s;hould be any
longer in the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>He &s;miled when he heard all this: and
I a&s;ked him, how he could make &s;o
light of it, when he mu&s;t needs know,
if there was any di&s;covery, I was un|done
for ever? and that even it would
hurt him, tho' not ruin him, as it would
me: I upbraided him, that he was like
all the re&s;t of the &s;ex, that when they
had the character and honour of a wo|man
<PB N="24" REF="32">
at their mercy, oftentimes made it
their je&s;t, and at lea&s;t looked upon it as
a trifle, and counted the ruin of tho&s;e,
they had had their will of, as a thing of
no value.</P>
<P>He &s;aw me warm and &s;erious, and
he changed his &s;tile immediately. He
told me, he was &s;orry I &s;hould have
&s;uch a thought of him; that he had
never given me the lea&s;t occa&s;ion for it,
but had been as tender of my reputa|tion,
as he could be of his own; that
he was &s;ure our corre&s;pondence had
been managed with &s;o much addre&s;s,
that not one creature in the family had
&s;o much as a &s;u&s;picion of it; that if he
&s;miled when I told him my thoughts, it
was at the a&s;&s;urance he lately received,
that our under&s;tanding one another,
was not &s;o much as gue&s;&s;ed at; and
that when he had told me how much
rea&s;on he had to be ea&s;y, I &s;hould &s;mile
as he did, for he was very certain, it
would give me a full &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>&startq;This is a my&s;tery I cannot under|&s;tand,&endq;
&s;ays I, &startq;or how it &s;hould be to
my &s;atisfaction that I am to be turned
out of doors; for if our corre&s;pondence
<PB N="25" REF="33">
is not di&s;covered, I know not what el&s;e
I have done to change the countenances
of the whole family, or to have them
treat me as they do now, who formerly
u&s;ed me with &s;o much tenderne&s;s, as
if I had been one of their own chil|dren.</P>
<P>&startq;Why look you, Letty,&endq; &s;ays he,
&startq;that they are unea&s;y about you, is
true; but that they have the lea&s;t &s;u|&s;picion
of the ca&s;e as it is, and as it re|&s;pects
you and I, is &s;o far from being
true, that they &s;u&s;pect my brother; and
in &s;hort they are fully per&s;uaded he makes
love to you: nay, he has put it into
their heads, for he is continually banter|ing
them about it, and making a je&s;t of
him&s;elf. I confe&s;s, I think he is wrong
to do &s;o, becau&s;e he cannot but &s;ee it
vexes them, and makes them unkind to
you; but it is a &s;atisfaction that they do
not &s;u&s;pect me, and I hope this will be
to your &s;atisfaction too.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;So it is,&endq; &s;ays I, &startq;one way, but
this does not reach my ca&s;e at all, nor is
this the chief thing that troubles me,
though I have been concerned about
that too.&endq; &startq;What is it then?&endq; &s;ays he.
<PB N="26" REF="34">
With which I fell into tears. He &s;trove
to pacify me all he could, but began at
la&s;t to be very pre&s;&s;ing upon me to tell
him what it was. I an&s;wered, that I
thought I ought to tell him, and that
he had &s;ome right to know it; be&s;ides,
I wanted his direction in the ca&s;e, for I
was in &s;uch perplexity, that I knew not
what cour&s;e to take: and then I related
the whole affair to him. I told him,
how imprudent his brother had manag|ed,
in making him&s;elf &s;o publick; for
that if he had kept it a &s;ecret, as &s;uch a
thing ought to have been, I could but
have denied him po&s;itively, without
giving any rea&s;on for it, and he would
in time have cea&s;ed his &s;ollicitations;
but that he had the vanity, fir&s;t, to de|pend
upon it that I would not deny him,
and then had taken the freedom to tell
his re&s;olution of having me to the
whole hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I told him how far I had re&s;i&s;ted him,
and how &s;incere and honourable his of|fers
were; &startq;But,&endq; &s;ays I, &startq;my ca&s;e
will be doubly hard; for as they car|ry
it ill to me now, becau&s;e he de&s;ires
to have me, they will carry it wor&s;e when
<PB N="27" REF="35">
they &s;hall find I have denied him; and
they will pre&s;ently &s;ay, `There is &s;ome|thing
el&s;e in it,' and then out it comes,
that I am already married to &s;omebody
el&s;e, or that I would never refu&s;e a
match &s;o much above me.&endq;</P>
<P>This di&s;cour&s;e &s;urpri&s;ed him: he told
me, it was a critical point for me to
manage, and he did not &s;ee which way I
&s;hould get out of it; but he would con|&s;ider
of it, and let me know the next
time we met, what re&s;olution he was
come to about it; and in the mean
time, de&s;ired I would not give my con|&s;ent
to his brother, nor yet give him a
a flat denial, but to hold him in &s;u|&s;pence.</P>
<P>I &s;tarted at his &s;aying, I &s;hould not
give him my con&s;ent. I &s;aid, he knew
very well I had no con&s;ent to give; that
he had engaged him&s;elf to marry me,
and my con&s;ent was at the &s;ame time
engaged to him: that he had all along
told me I was his wife, and I looked
upon my&s;elf as effectually &s;o, as if the
ceremony had pa&s;&s;ed; and it was from
his own mouth that I did &s;o, he having
<PB N="28" REF="36">
all along per&s;uaded me to call my&s;elf
his wife.</P>
<P>&startq;Well, my dear love, don't be con|cerned,
if I am not your hu&s;band, I will be
as good as a hu&s;band to you; and do not
let tho&s;e things trouble you now, but let
me look a little farther into this affair,
and I &s;hall be able to &s;ay more next
time we meet.&endq;</P>
<P>He pacified me as well as he could
with this: but I found he was very
thoughtful, and though he was very
kind to me, and ki&s;&s;ed me often, yet he
offered no more all the while we were to|gether,
which was above two hours,
and which I much wondered at, con&s;i|dering
what opportunity we had.</P>
<P>His brother did not come from Lon|don
for five or &s;ix days, and it was two
days more before he got an opportunity
to talk with him; but then getting him
by him&s;elf, he began to talk very clo&s;e
to him about it: and the &s;ame evening
he repeated the &s;ub&s;tance of their di&s;cour&s;e
to me, which as near as I can remember
was to the purpo&s;e following: he &s;aid, he
had heard &s;trange news of him &s;ince he
went&mdash;that he made love to Mrs. Letty.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="37">
&startq;Well,&endq; &s;ays his brother, a little an|grily,
&startq;and what then? What has
any body to do wi$h it&punc;&endq; Nay,&endq; &s;ays
his brother,&endq; don't be angry Robert, I
don't pretend to have any thing to do
with it, nor do I pretend to be angry
with you; but I find they do concern
them&s;elves about it, and that they u&s;e
the poor girl ill, which I &s;hould take
as done to my&s;elf. &startq;Who do you mean
by They,&endq; &s;ays Robert. &startq;I mean my
mother, and the girls,&endq; &s;ays the elder
brother.</P>
<P>&startq;But hark ye, are you in earne&s;t,
do you really love the girl? you may be
free with me, brother.&endq; Why then,&endq;
&s;ays Robert, &startq;I will be free with you.
I do love her above all the women in the
world; and I will have her, let them &s;ay
and do what they will. I believe the
girl will not deny me.&endq;</P>
<P>It &s;truck me to the heart when he
told me this: for though it was mo&s;t ra|tional
to think I would not deny him,
yet I knew in my con&s;cience I mu&s;t de|ny
him, and I &s;aw my ruin in my being
obliged to do &s;o; but I knew it was my
<PB N="30" REF="38">
bu&s;ine&s;s to talk otherwi&s;e then, &s;o I in|terrupted
him in his &s;tory.</P>
<P>&startq;Ay!&endq; &s;aid I, &startq;does he think I can|not
deny him? but he &s;hall find I can
deny him.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, my dear,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;but let
me give you the whole &s;tory as it went
on between us, and then &s;ay what you
will.&endq;</P>
<P>Then he went on and told me, that
he replied, &startq;But brother, you know
&s;he has nothing, and you may have &s;e|veral
ladies with good fortunes.&endq; &startq;It
is no matter for that,&endq; &s;aid Robert, &startq;I
love the girl; and I will never plea&s;e
my pocket in marrying, and not plea&s;e
my fancy;&endq; and &s;o, my dear, added he,
there is no oppo&s;ing him.</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, yes,&endq; &s;ays I, &startq;you &s;hall &s;ee I
can oppo&s;e him: I have learn'd to &s;ay
No now, tho' I had not learnt it before;
and if the be&s;t lord in the land offered me
marriage, I could very chearfully &s;ay
No to him.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, but my dear,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;what
can you &s;ay to him? You know, as
you &s;aid, when we talked of it before,
he will a&s;k you many que&s;tions about
<PB N="31" REF="39">
it, and all the family will wonder what
the meaning of it &s;hould be.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, &s;ays I, &s;miling, &startq;I can &s;top
all their mouths at once, by telling
him, and them too, that I am married
already to his elder brother.&endq;</P>
<P>He &s;miled a little too at the word,
but I could &s;ee it &s;tartled him, and he
could not hide the di&s;order it put him
into; however, he returned, &startq;Why, tho'
that may be true in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, yet I
&s;uppo&s;e you are but in je&s;t when you
talk of giving &s;uch an an&s;wer, as it
may not be convenient on many ac|counts.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, no,&endq; &s;ays I plea&s;antly, &startq;I
am not &s;o fond of letting that &s;ecret
come out, without your con&s;ent.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But what then can you &s;ay to
him, or to them,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;when
they find you po&s;itive again&s;t a match,
which would be apparently &s;o much to
your advantage?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why,&endq; &s;ays I, &startq;&s;hould I be at a
lo&s;s? Fir&s;t, I am not obliged to give
them any rea&s;on at all: on the other
hand, I may tell them, I am married
already, and &s;top there; and that will
<PB N="32" REF="40">
be a full &s;top too to him, for he can
have no rea&s;on to a&s;k me one que&s;tion
after it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ay,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;but the whole
hou&s;e will teize you about it, even to my
father and mother; and if you deny them
po&s;itively, they will be di&s;obliged at
you, and &s;u&s;picious be&s;ides.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why,&endq; &s;ays I, &startq;what can I do?
What would you have me do? I was in
&s;trait enough before, and, as I told
you, I was in perplexity before, and ac|quainted
you with the circum&s;tances,
that I might have your advice.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My dear,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;I have been
con&s;idering very much upon it, you
may be &s;ure; and though it is a piece
of advice that has a great many morti|fications
in it to me, and may at fir&s;t
&s;eem &s;trange to you, yet, all things con|&s;idered,
I &s;ee no better way than to let
him go on; and if you find him in
earne&s;t, marry him.&endq;</P>
<P>I gave him a look full of horror at
tho&s;e words, and turning pale as death,
was at the very point of &s;inking down
out of the chair I &s;at in: when giving
a &s;tart, &startq;My dear,&endq; &s;ays he, aloud,
<PB N="33" REF="41">
&startq;what is the matter with you? Where
are you going?&endq; and a great many &s;uch
things; and with jogging and calling
to me, fetched me a little to my&s;elf,
though it was a good while before I
fully recovered my &s;en&s;es, and was not
able to &s;peak for &s;everal minutes after.</P>
<P>When I was fully recovered he be|gan
again. &startq;My dear,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;what
made you &s;o &s;urpri&s;ed at what I &s;aid? I
would have you con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly of it:
you may &s;ee plainly how the family
&s;tand, and they would be &s;tark mad if
it was my ca&s;e, as it is my brother's;
and for ought I &s;ee, it would be my
ruin and your's too.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ah!&endq; &s;ays I, &s;till &s;peaking angri|ly,
&startq;are all your prote&s;tations and vow$
to be &s;haken by the di&s;like of the fami|ly?
Did I not always object that to
you, and you made light of it, as what
you were above, and would not value;
and is it come to this now? is this your
faith and honour, your love, and the
&s;olidity of your promi&s;es?&endq;</P>
<P>He continued perfectly calm, notwith|&s;tanding
all my reproaches, and I was
not &s;paring of them; but he replied at
<PB N="34" REF="42">
la&s;t, &startq;My dear I have not broken one
promi&s;e with you yet. I did tell you I
would marry you when I was come to
my e&s;tate: but you &s;ee my father is a
hail healthy man, and may live the&s;e
thirty years &s;till, and not be older than
&s;everal are round us in the town; and
you never propo&s;ed my marrying you
&s;ooner, becau&s;e you know it might be
my ruin: and as to all the re&s;t, I have
not failed you in any thing, you have
wanted for nothing.&endq;</P>
<P>I could not deny a word of this, and
had nothing to &s;ay to it in general;</P>
<P>&startq;But why then,&endq; &s;ays I, &startq;can you
per&s;uade me to &s;uch a horrid &s;tep, as
leaving you, &s;ince you have not left
me? Will you allow no affection, no
love on my &s;ide, where there has been
&s;o much on yours? Have I made you
no returns? Have I given no te&s;timo|ny
of my &s;incerity, and of my pa&s;&s;ion?
are the &s;acrifices I have made, no proof
of my being tied to you in bonds too
&s;trong to be broken?</P>
<P>&startq;But here, my dear,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;you
may come into a &s;a&s;e &s;tation, and appear
with honour, and with &s;plendor at once,
<PB N="35" REF="43">
and the remembrance of what we have
done, may be wrapt up in an eternal
&s;ilence, as if it had never happened.
You &s;hall always have my re&s;pect, and
my &s;incere affection, only then it &s;hall
be hone&s;t, and perfectly ju&s;t to my
brother, you &s;hall be my dear &s;i&s;ter, as
now you are my dear&mdash;&endq; and there he
&s;topped.</P>
<P>&startq;Ba&s;e man! your dear whore, you
mu&s;t have &s;aid, if you had gone on,
and you might as well have &s;aid it; but
I under&s;tand you: however, I de&s;ire you
to remember the di&s;cour&s;es you have
had with me, and the pains you have
taken to per&s;uade me to believe my&s;elf
an hone&s;t woman; that I was your wife
intentionally, though not in the eye of
the world; and that it was as effectual
a marriage that had pa&s;&s;ed between us,
as if we had been publickly wedded in
the church. You know, and cannot but
remember that the&s;e have been your own
words to me.&endq;</P>
<P>He &s;tanding motionle&s;s for a while,
without replying, I proceeded thus:</P>
<P>&startq;You cannot, without the highe&s;t
inju&s;tice, believe that I yielded upon all
<PB N="36" REF="44">
the&s;e per&s;ua&s;ions without a love not to
be que&s;tioned, not to be &s;haken again
by any thing that could happen af|terward:
if you have &s;uch di&s;honoura|ble
thoughts of me, I mu&s;t a&s;k you
what foundation in any of my beha|viour
have I given for &s;uch a &s;ugge&s;tion?
If then I have yielded to the impor|tunities
of my affection; if I have been
per&s;uaded to believe that I am really
your wife, &s;hall I now give the lie to all
tho&s;e arguments, and call my&s;elf your
mi&s;tre&s;s? And will you transfer me to
your brother? can you transfer my af|fection?
can you bid me cea&s;e loving
you, and bid me love him? is it in my
power, think you, to make &s;uch a change
at demand? No, Sir, depend upon it,
it is impo&s;&s;ible; and whatever the al|teration
on your &s;ide may be, I will
ever be true; and I had much rather,
&s;ince it is come to this unhappy length,
be a mi&s;tre&s;s to you, than a wife to your
brother.&endq;</P>
<P>He appeared plea&s;ed, and touched with
the impre&s;&s;ion of this di&s;cour&s;e; and told
me he had not been unfaithful in any
one promi&s;e he had ever made me yet,
<PB N="37" REF="45">
but there were &s;o many terrible things
pre&s;ented them&s;elves to his view in the
affair before me, and on my account in
particular, that he had thought of the
other as a remedy &s;o effectual, as no|thing
could come up to it: that he
thought this would not be an entire
parting us, but we might love as friends
all our days, and perhaps with more
&s;atisfaction, than we &s;hould in the &s;itua|tion
we were now in, as things might
happen: he dur&s;t &s;ay, I could not ap|prehend
any thing from him, as to be|traying
a &s;ecret, which could not but
be the de&s;truction of us both, if it came
out: he had but one que&s;tion to a&s;k of
me, that could lie in the way of it, and
it that que&s;tion was an&s;wered in the ne|gative,
he could not but think &s;till it
was the only &s;tep I could take.</P>
<P>I gue&s;&s;ed at his que&s;tion pre&s;ently,
namely, whether I was &s;ure I was not
with child? As to that, I told him, he
need not be concerned about it, for I
was not with child. &startq;Why then, my
dear,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;we have no time to
talk farther now; con&s;ider of it, and
think clo&s;ely about it. I cannot but be
<PB N="38" REF="46">
of the opinion &s;till, that it will be the
be&s;t cour&s;e you can take: and with this,
he took his leave, and the more ha&s;tily
too, his mother and &s;i&s;ters ringing at the
gate, ju&s;t at the moment that he had
ri&s;en up to go.</P>
<P>He left me in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion
of thought; and he ea&s;ily perceived it
the next day, and all the re&s;t of the
week: but he had no opportunity to
come at me till the Sunday after, when
I being indi&s;po&s;ed did not go to church,
and he making &s;ome excu&s;e &s;taid al&s;o
at home.</P>
<P>Here he was with me an hour and a
half, and we fell into the &s;ame argu|ments
over again, or at lea&s;t &s;o near the
&s;ame, as it would be to no purpo&s;e to
repeat them. At la&s;t, I a&s;ked him warm|ly
what opinion he mu&s;t have of me,
that he could &s;uppo&s;e, I &s;hould &s;o much
as entertain a thought of lying with two
brothers? and a&s;&s;ured him it could
never be. I added, if he was to tell me
that he would never &s;ee me again, than
which nothing could be more terrible,
yet I could never entertain a thought &s;o
di&s;honourable to my&s;elf, and &s;o ba&s;e to
<PB N="39" REF="47">
him; and therefore, I entreated him, if
he had any affection left for me, that he
would &s;peak no more of it, or that he
would draw his &s;word and kill me. He
appeared &s;urpri&s;ed at my ob&s;tinacy, as
he called it; told me I was unkind to
my&s;elf and unkind to him in it; that it
was a cri&s;is unlooked for, upon us both,
and impo&s;&s;ible for either or us to fore|&s;ee;
but that he did not know any other
way to &s;ave us from ruin, and therefore
he thought it the more unkind; but
that if he mu&s;t &s;ay no more of it to me,
he added, with an unu&s;ual coldne&s;s, that
he did not know any thing el&s;e we had
to talk of; and ro&s;e up to take his
leave. I ro&s;e up too as if with the &s;ame
indifference: but, when he came to give
me as it were a parting ki&s;s, I bur&s;t out
into &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion of crying, that tho'
I would have &s;poke, I could not, and
only pre&s;&s;ing his hand, &s;eemed to give
him the adieu, but cried vehemently.</P>
<P>He was &s;en&s;ibly moved with this: &s;o
he &s;at down again, and &s;aid a great ma|ny
kind things to me, to abate the ex|ce&s;s
of my pa&s;&s;ion; but &s;till urged the
nece&s;&s;ity of what he had propo&s;ed&punc; All
<PB N="40" REF="48">
the while in&s;i&s;ting that if I did refu&s;e,
he would notwith&s;tanding provide for
me; but letting me plainly &s;ee, that he
would decline me as a mi&s;tre&s;s; making
it a point of honour not to lie with the
woman, that, for ought he knew, might
come to be his brother's wife.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of him as a gallant was not
&s;o much my affliction, as the lo&s;s of his
per&s;on, whom I loved to di&s;traction;
and the lo&s;s of all the expectations I
had, and which I had always built my
hopes upon, of having him one day for
my hu&s;band. The&s;e things oppre&s;&s;ed my
mind &s;o much, that I fell very ill: the
ag$nies of my mind, threw me into a
high fever, and long it was, that none
in the family expected me to live.</P>
<P>It was near five weeks that I kept my
bed: and though the violence of my fever
abated in three weeks, yet it &s;everal times
returned; and the phy&s;ician and the apo|thecary
&s;aid, &s;everal times, they could do no
more for me, but that they mu&s;t leave na|ture
and the di&s;temper to fight it out;
only &s;trenthening the fir&s;t with cordials
to maintain the &s;truggle. After the end
of five weeks I grew better: but was &s;o
<PB N="41" REF="49">
weak, &s;o altered, &s;o melancholy, and
recovered &s;o &s;lowly, that they apprehend|ed
I &s;hould go into a con&s;umption; and,
which vexed me mo&s;t, they gave it as
their opinion, that my mind was op|pre&s;&s;ed,
that &s;omething troubled me,
and in &s;hort, that I was in love. Upon
this, the whole hou&s;e was &s;et upon me
to examine me, and to pre&s;s me to tell
whether I was in love or not, and with
whom; but I denied my being in love
at all.</P>
<P>They had on this occa&s;ion a little
quarrel one day about me, that had like
to have put the whole family in an up|roar,
and for &s;ome time did &s;o. They
happened to be all at table, but the fa|ther;
as for me I was ill, and in my
chamber: at the beginning of the talk,
which was ju&s;t as they had fini&s;hed their
dinner, the old lady, who had &s;ent me
&s;omething to eat, called her maid to go
up, and a&s;k me if I would&punc; have any
more; but the maid brought down
word, I had not eaten half what &s;he
had &s;ent me already.
<PB N="42" REF="50">
&startq;Alas,&endq; &s;ays the old lady, &startq;that poor
girl! I am afraid, &s;he will never be
well.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well l&endq; &s;ays the elder brother,
&startq;how &s;hould Mrs. Letty be well; they
&s;ay &s;he is in love?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I believe nothing of it,&endq; &s;ays the
mother.</P>
<P>&startq;I do not know,&endq; &s;ays the elde&s;t &s;i&s;|ter,
&startq;what to &s;ay to it: they have made
&s;uch a rout about her being &s;o hand&s;ome,
and &s;o charming, and I know not what,
and in her hearing too, that it has turn|ed
the creature's head I believe, and
who knows what po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions may follow
&s;uch doings? for my part I do not
know what to make of it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, &s;i&s;ter, you mu&s;t acknowledge
&s;he is very hand&s;ome,&endq; &s;ays the elder
brother.</P>
<P>&startq;Ay, and a great deal hand&s;omer
than you, &s;i&s;ter,&endq; &s;ays Robert; &startq;and that
is your mortification.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, well, that is not the que&s;|tion,&endq;
&s;ays his &s;i&s;ter; &startq;the girl is well
enough, and &s;he knows it; &s;he need not
be told of it to make her vain.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="51">
&startq;We are not talking of her being
vain,&endq; &s;ays the elder brother, &startq;but her
being in love; it may be &s;he is in love
with her&s;elf, it &s;eems my &s;i&s;ters think
&s;o.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I would &s;he was in love with me,&endq;
&s;ays Robert, &startq;I would quickly put her
out of her pain.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What do you mean, &s;on,&endq; &s;ays the
old lady, &startq;how can you talk &s;o?&endq;
&startq;Why Madam, very hone&s;tly, do
you think I would let the poor girl die
for love, and of one that is near at hand
to be had too?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Fy brother,&endq; &s;ays the &s;econd &s;i&s;ter,
&startq;I am a&s;hamed of you; would you take
a creature that has not a groat in the
world?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Prithee, mi&s;s,&endq; &s;ays Robert, beau|ty
is a portion, and good-humour with
it, is a double portion; I wi&s;h you
had half her &s;tock.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I find,&endq; &s;ays the elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, &startq;if
Letty is not in love, my brother is; I
wonder he has not broke his mind to
her: I warrant &s;he will not &s;ay No.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;They that yield when they are a&s;k|ed,&endq;
&s;ays Robert, &startq;are one &s;tep before
<PB N="44" REF="52">
them that were never a&s;ked to yield, and
two &s;teps before them that yield before
they are a&s;ked: and that is an an&s;wer
to you, &s;i&s;ter.&endq;</P>
<P>This fired the &s;i&s;ter, and &s;he flew in|to
a pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;aid things were come to
that pa&s;s, that it was time the wench
was out of the family; and but that &s;he
was not fit to be turned out, &s;he hoped
her father and mother would con&s;ider of
it, as &s;oon as &s;he could be removed.</P>
<P>Robert replied, that was bu&s;ine&s;s for
the ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s of the family,
who were not to be taught by one that
had &s;o little judgment as his elde$t
&s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>It ran up a great deal farther; the
&s;i&s;ter &s;colded, Robert rallied and ban|tered,
but I lo&s;t ground by it extreamly
in the family. I heard of it, and I cried
heartily: and the old lady came up to
me, &s;omebody having told her that I
was &s;o much concerned about it. I com|plained
to her, that it was very hard
the doctors &s;hould pa&s;s &s;uch a cen&s;ure
upon me, for which they had no ground;
and that it was &s;till harder, con&s;idering
the circum&s;tances I was under in the
<PB N="45" REF="53">
family; that I hoped I had done no|thing
to le&s;&s;en her e&s;teem for me, or
given any occa&s;ion for the bickering be|tween
her &s;ons and daughters; and I
had more need to think of a coffin than
of being in love, and begged &s;he would
not let me &s;uffer in her opinion for any
body's mi&s;takes but my own.</P>
<P>She was &s;en&s;ible of the ju&s;tice of what
I &s;aid: but told me, &s;ince there was &s;uch
a clamour among them, and that her
younger &s;on talked after &s;uch a rattling
way as he did; &s;he de&s;ired I would be
&s;o faithful to her, as to an&s;wer her one
que&s;tion &s;incerely. I told her I would,
and with the utmo&s;t plainne&s;s and &s;ince|rity.
Why then the que&s;tion was, whe|ther
there was any thing between her &s;on
Robert and me? I told her with all the
prote&s;tations of &s;incerity that I was a|ble
to make, that there was not, nor
ever had been. I told her, that Mr.
Robert had rattled and je&s;ted, as &s;he
knew it was his way, and that I took it
always as I &s;uppo&s;ed he meant it, to be
a wild airy way of di&s;cour&s;e that had no
&s;ignification in it: and again a&s;&s;ured her,
that there was not the lea&s;t tittle of what
<PB N="46" REF="54">
&s;he under&s;tood by it between us; and
tho&s;e who had &s;ugge&s;ted &s;o had done me
a great deal of wrong, and Mr. Robert
no &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The old lady was fully &s;atisfied, and
ki&s;&s;ed me, &s;poke chearfully to me, bid
me take care of my health, and want for
nothing, and &s;o took her leave: but
when &s;he came down, &s;he found the
brother and all his &s;i&s;ters together by
the ears: they were angry even to pa&s;|&s;ion,
at his upbraiding them with their
being homely, and having never had
any &s;weatheart, never having been a&s;ked
the que&s;tion, and their being &s;o forward
as almo&s;t to a&s;k fir&s;t. He rallied them
upon the &s;ubject of Mrs. Letty; how
pretty, how good-humoured, how &s;he
&s;ung better than they did, and danced
better, and how much hand&s;omer &s;he
was: and in doing this, he omitted no
ill-natured thing that could vex them,
and indeed, was too hard upon them.
The old lady came down in the height
of it, and to put a &s;top to it, told them
all the di&s;cour&s;e &s;he had had with me.</P>
<P>&startq;She is wrong there,&endq; &s;ays Robert,
&startq;for if there was not a great deal be|tween
<PB N="47" REF="55">
us, we &s;hould be clo&s;er together
than we are: I have told her I loved
her, but I could never make the jade
believe I was in earne&s;t&endq;.</P>
<P>&startq;I do not know how you &s;hould,&endq;
&s;ays his mother, &startq;nobody in their
&s;en&s;es could believe you were in earne&s;t,
to talk &s;o to a poor girl, who&s;e cir|cum&s;tances
you know &s;o well. But
prithee &s;on,&endq; added &s;he, &startq;&s;ince you
tell me that you could not make her
believe you were in earne&s;t, what mu&s;t
we believe about it? for you ramble &s;o
in your di&s;cour&s;e, that nobody knows
whether you are in earne&s;t or in je&s;t:
but as I find the girl by your own con|fe&s;&s;ion
has an&s;wered truly, I wi&s;h you
would do &s;o too, and tell me &s;eriou&s;ly,
&s;o that I may depend upon it; Is there
any thing in it or no? Are you in
earne&s;t or no? Are you di&s;tracted, in|deed,
or are you not? It is a weighty
que&s;tion, and I wi&s;h you would make us
ea&s;y about it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Faith, madam,&endq; &s;ays Robert, &startq;it

any lies about it. I am in earne&s;t. If
Mrs. Letty would &s;ay &s;he loved me,

and that &s;he would marry me, I would
have her to-morrow morning.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well,&endq; &s;ays the mother, &startq;then
there is one &s;on lo&s;t; and &s;he &s;aid it in
a very mournful tone, as one greatly
concerned at it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I hope not, madam, &s;ays Robert;
&startq;no man is lo&s;t, when a good wife has
found him.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, but &s;on,&endq; &s;ays the old lady,
&startq;&s;he is a beggar.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why then, madam, &s;he has the
more need of charity: I will take her
off of the hands of the pari&s;h, and &s;he
and I will beg together.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It is bad je&s;ting with &s;uch things,&endq;
&s;ays the mother.</P>
<P>&startq;I do not je&s;t madam,&endq; &s;ays Robert:
&startq;We will come and beg your pardon,
and your ble&s;&s;ing, madam, and my fa|ther's.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This is all out of the way, &s;on,&endq;
&s;ays the mother;&endq; &startq;if you are in earne&s;t
you are undone.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I am afraid not,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;for I am
really afraid &s;he will not have me, after
all my &s;i&s;ter's huffing and blu&s;tering; I
<PB N="49" REF="57">
believe I &s;hall never be able to per&s;uade
her to it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That is a fine tale, indeed; &s;he is
not &s;o far out of her &s;en&s;es neither.
Letty is no fool,&endq; &s;ays the younge&s;t &s;i&s;|ter:
&startq;Do you think &s;he has learned to
&s;ay No, any more than other people?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, Mrs. Mirth-wit,&endq; &s;ays Ro|bert,
&startq;Mrs. Letty's no fool; but Mrs.
Letty may be engaged &s;ome other way,
and what then?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Nay,&endq; &s;ays the elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, &startq;we
can &s;ay nothing to that: Who mu&s;t it
be to then? She is never out of doors,
it mu&s;t be between you.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have nothing to &s;ay to that,&endq; &s;ays
Robert, &startq;I have been examined enough;
there is my brother James, if it mu&s;t
be between us, go to work with him.&endq;</P>
<P>This &s;tung the elder brother to the
quick, and he concluded that Robert
had di&s;covered &s;omething: however, he
kept him&s;elf from appearing di&s;turbed.
&startq;Prithee,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;do not go to
&s;ham your &s;tories off upon me, I tell
you&punc; I deal in no &s;uch ware; I have no|thing
to &s;ay to Mrs. Letty, nor to any
<PB N="50" REF="58">
of the Mi&s;s Letties in the pari&s;h;&endq; and
with that he ro&s;e up and went away.</P>
<P>&startq;No,&endq; &s;ays the elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, &startq;I dare
an&s;wer for him; my brother, I know,
knows the world better.&endq;</P>
<P>Thus the di&s;cour&s;e ended; but it left
the elder brother quite confounded: he
concluded his brother Robert had made
a full di&s;covery, and he began to doubt,
whether I had been concerned in it, or
not; but with all his management, he
could not bring it about to get at me;
at la&s;t, he was &s;o perplexed, that he
was quite de&s;perate, and re&s;olved he
would come into my chamber and &s;ee
me, whatever came of it; in order to
this, he contrived it &s;o, that one day af|ter
dinner, watching his elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, till
he could &s;ee her go up &s;tairs, he runs
after her: &startq;Si&s;ter,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;where
is this &s;ick girl? may not a body &s;ee
her?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes,&endq; &s;ays the &s;i&s;ter, &startq;I believe
you may; but let me go fir&s;t a little,
and I will tell you.&endq;</P>
<P>So &s;he run up to the door, and gave
notice; and pre&s;ently called to him:
<PB N="51" REF="59">
&startq;Brother, you may come if you plea&s;e.&endq;
So in he came.</P>
<P>&startq;Well,&endq; &s;ays he, at the door, as he
came in, &startq;where is this &s;ick body that
is in love? How do ye do, Mrs. Let|ty?&endq;</P>
<P>I would have got up out of my
chair, but was &s;o weak I could not, and
he &s;aw it and his &s;i&s;ter too; and &s;he &s;aid,
&startq;Come, do not &s;trive to &s;tand up; my
brother de&s;ires no ceremony, e&s;pecially
now you are &s;o weak.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, No, Mrs. Letty, pray &s;it &s;till,&endq;
&s;ays he; and &s;o &s;its him&s;elf down in a
chair over again&s;t me, and appeared as
if he was mightily plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>He talked a deal to his &s;i&s;ter, and to
me; &s;ometimes of one thing, &s;ometimes
of another, on purpo&s;e to amu&s;e her;
and every now and then, would turn it
upon the old &s;tory, directing it to me.
&startq;Poor Mrs. Letty, it is a &s;ad thing
to be in love; why it has reduced you
&s;adly.&endq;</P>
<P>At la&s;t I &s;poke a little: I am glad
to &s;ee you &s;o merry, Sir, but I think
the doctor might have found &s;ome|thing
better to do than to make his
<PB N="52" REF="60">
game at his patient: if I had been ill of
no other di&s;temper, I know the proverb
too well to have let him come to
me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What proverb?&endq; &s;ays he: &startq;O! I
remember it now.</P>
<P>Where Love is the ca&s;e,
The Doctor's an a&s;s.</P>
<P>Is not that it, Mrs. Letty?&endq;</P>
<P>I &s;miled, and &s;aid nothing.</P>
<P>&startq;Nay,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;I think the effect
has proved it to be love; for it &s;eems
the doctor has been able to do you but
little &s;ervice, you mend very &s;lowly they
&s;ay: I doubt there is &s;omething in it,
Mrs. Letty.&endq;</P>
<P>I &s;miled and &s;aid, &startq;No, indeed,
Sir, that is none of my di&s;temper.&endq;</P>
<P>We had a deal of &s;uch di&s;cour&s;e, and
&s;ometimes other that &s;ignified as little;
by and by he a&s;ked me to &s;ing them a
&s;ong; at which I &s;miled, and &s;aid, &startq;My
&s;inging days are over.&endq;</P>
<P>At la&s;t he a&s;ked me, if he &s;hould
play upon his flute to me. His &s;i&s;ter
&s;aid, &s;he believed it would hurt me, and
<PB N="53" REF="61">
that my head could not bear it. I
bowed and &s;aid, &startq;No, it would not
hurt me&endq;</P>
<P>Then his &s;i&s;ter &s;aid, &startq;Do then, bro|ther.&endq;</P>
<P>With that he pulled out the key of
his clo&s;et, &startq;Dear &s;i&s;ter,&endq; $ays he, &startq;I
am very lazy, do, &s;tep to my clo&s;et
and fetch my flute; it lies in &s;uch a
drawer,&endq; naming a place where he was
&s;ure it was not, that &s;he might be &s;ome
time looking for it.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he was gone, he related
the di&s;cour&s;e his brother had about me,
and his own concern about it, which was
the rea&s;on of his contriving this vi&s;it to
me. I a&s;&s;ured him, I had never opened
my mouth either to his brother, or to
any body el&s;e: I told him the dreadful
exigence I was in; that my love to him,
and his offering to have me forget that
affection, and remove it to another, had
thrown me down; and that I had a thou|&s;and
times wi&s;hed I might die, rather
than recover, and to have the &s;ame cir|cum&s;tances
to &s;truggle with as I had be|fore;
and that this backwardne&s;s to life,
had been the great rea&s;on of the &s;low|ne&s;s
<PB N="54" REF="62">
of my recovering: I added, I fore|&s;aw,
that as &s;oon as I was well, I mu&s;t quit
the family: and as for marrying his bro|ther,
I abhorred the thoughts of it, after
what had been my ca&s;e with him, and
that he might depend upon it, I would ne|ver
&s;ee his, brother again upon that &s;ub|ject:
that if he would break all his vows
and oaths and engagements with me,
be that between his con&s;cience and his
honour, and him&s;elf: but he &s;hould ne|ver
be able to &s;ay, that I who he had
per&s;uaded to call my&s;elf his wife, and
who had given him the liberty to u&s;e
me as a wife, was not as faithful to him
as a wife ought to be, whatever he might
be to me.</P>
<P>He was going to reply, and had &s;aid,
that he was &s;orry I could not be per|&s;uaded,
and was going to &s;ay more, but
he heard his &s;i&s;ter a coming, and &s;o did
I; and yet I forced out the&s;e few words
as a reply, that I could never be per&s;uad|ed
to love one brother, and marry ano|ther.
He &s;hook his head and &s;aid,
&startq;Then I am ruined,&endq; meaning him&s;elf;
and that moment his &s;i&s;ter entered the
room, and told him &s;he could not find
<PB N="55" REF="63">
the flute. &startq;Well,&endq; &s;ays he, merrily,
&startq;this lazine&s;s won't do:&endq; &s;o he gets up
and goes him&s;elf to look for it, but
comes back without it too; not but that
he could have found it, but becau&s;e his
mind was di&s;turbed, and he had no mind
to play; and be&s;ides, the errand he &s;ent
his &s;i&s;ter upon, was an&s;wered another
way; as he only wanted an opportuni|ty
to &s;peak to me, which he gained,
though not much to his &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>I had, however, a great deal of &s;a|tisfaction
in having &s;poken my mind to
him with freedom, and with &s;uch an
hone&s;t plainne&s;s as I have related; and
though it did not at all work that way,
I de&s;ired, that is to &s;ay, to oblige the
per&s;on to me the more; yet it took
from him all po&s;&s;ibility of quitting me,
but by a down right breach of honour,
and giving up all the faith of a gentle|man
to me, which he had &s;o often en|gaged
by, never to abandon me, but to
make me his wife as &s;oon as he came to
his e&s;tate.</P>
<P>It was not many weeks after this, be|fore&punc;
I was about the hou&s;e again, and
began to grow well; but I continued
<PB N="56" REF="64">
melancholy, &s;ilent, dull, and retired,
which amazed the whole family, except|ing
he, that knew the rea&s;on of it; yet
it was great while before he took any
notice of it, and I as backward to &s;peak
as he, carried re&s;pectfully to him, but
never offered to &s;peak a word to him,
that was particular of any kind what&s;o|ever;
and this continued for &s;ixteen or
&s;eventeen weeks, &s;o that as I expected
every day to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the family, on
account of the di&s;ta&s;te they had taken
another way, in which I had no guilt,
&s;o I expected to hear no more of him,
after all his &s;olemn vows and prote&s;ta|tions,
$ut to be ruined and abandon|ed.</P>
<P>At la&s;t I broke the way my&s;elf in the
family, for my removal; for being talk|ing
&s;eriou&s;ly with the old lady, one day,
abo$t my own circum&s;tances in the
world, and how my di&s;temper had left a
heavine&s;s&punc; on my &s;pirits that I was not the
&s;ame thing I was before; the old lady
replied, &startq;I am afraid Letty, what I have
&s;aid to you about my &s;on, has had &s;ome
influence upon you, and that you are
melancholy on his account; pray will
<PB N="57" REF="65">
you let me know how the matter &s;tands
with you both, if it may not be im|proper?
for as for Robert he does no|thing
but rally and banter when I &s;peak
of it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Truly, madam, that matter &s;tands
as I wi&s;h it did not, and I &s;hall be very
&s;incere with you, whatever befalls me
for it. Mr. Robert has &s;everal times
propo&s;ed marriage to me, which is what
I had no rea&s;on to expect, my circum|&s;tances
con&s;idered; but I have always
re&s;i&s;ted him, and, perhaps, in terms
more po&s;itive then became me, con&s;i|dering
the regard I ought to have for
every branch of your family: but, ma|dam,
I could never &s;o far forget my
obligations to you, and all your hou&s;e,
to offer to con&s;ent to a thing, which I
know mu&s;t be di&s;obliging to you; and
this I have made my argument to him,
and have po&s;itively told him, that I
would never entertain a thought of that
kind, unle&s;s I had your con&s;ent and his
father's al&s;o, to whom I was bound by
&s;o many invincible obligations.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And is this po&s;&s;ible, Letty?&endq; &s;ays
the old lady; &startq;then you have been ju&s;|ter
<PB N="58" REF="66">
to us, than we have been to you;
for we have all looked upon you as a
kind of a &s;nare to my &s;on; and I had a
propo&s;al to make to you, for your re|moving,
for fear of it; but I have not
yet mentioned it to you, becau&s;e I
thought you were not thoroughly well,
and I was afraid of grieving you too
much, le&s;t it &s;hould throw you down
again, for we have all a re&s;pect for you
&s;till, though not &s;o much as to have it
be the ruin of my &s;on; but if it be as
you &s;ay, we have all wronged you great|ly.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;As to the truth of what I &s;ay, ma|dam,
I refer you to your &s;on him&s;elf; if
he will do me ju&s;tice, he mu&s;t tell you
the &s;tory as I have told it.&endq;</P>
<P>Away went the old lady to her daugh|ters,
and tells them the whole &s;tory, and
they were &s;urpri&s;ed at it, as I believed
they would be: one &s;aid &s;he could never
have thought it; another &s;aid, Robert
was a fool; a third &s;aid, &s;he would not
believe a word of it, and &s;he would
warrant that Robert would tell the &s;tory
another way; but the old lady, who was
re&s;olved to go to the bottom of it, be|fore
<PB N="59" REF="67">
I could have the lea&s;t opportunity
of acquainting him with what had pa&s;&s;|ed,
re&s;olved too, that &s;he would talk to
her &s;on immediately, and to that pur|po&s;e
&s;ent for him.</P>
<P>Upon his coming up to them, for
they were all &s;till together; &startq; Sit down,
Robert,&endq; &s;ays the old lady, &startq;I mu&s;t
have &s;ome talk with you.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;With all my heart, madam,&endq; &s;ays
he, looking very merry: &startq;I hope it is
about a good wife; for I am at a great
lo&s;s in that affair.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;How can that be?&endq; &s;ays his mo|ther;
&startq;did not you &s;ay, you re&s;olved
to have Letty.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ay, madam, but there is one has
forbid the banns.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Forbid the banns!&endq; &s;ays his mo|ther?
&startq;who can that be.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Even Mrs. Letty her&s;elf,&endq; &s;ays Ro|bert.</P>
<P>&startq;How &s;o?&endq; &s;ays his mother; &startq;have
you a&s;ked her the que&s;tion then?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, indeed, madam, I have at|tacked
her in form five times &s;ince &s;he
was &s;ick, and am beaten off; the jade is
&s;o &s;tout, &s;he will not capitulate, nor
<PB N="60" REF="68">
yield upon any terms, except &s;uch as I
cannot effectually grant.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Explain your&s;elf,&endq; &s;ays his mother,
&startq;for I am &s;urpri&s;ed! I do not under|&s;tand
you; I hope you are not in earne&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, madam, the ca&s;e is plain
enough upon me; it explains it&s;elf: &s;he
will not have me, &s;he &s;ays. Is not that
plain enough? I think it is plain, and
pretty rough too.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, but,&endq; &s;ays the mother, &startq;you
talk of conditions, that you cannot
grant. What! does &s;he want a &s;ettle|ment?
Her jointure ought to be accord|ing
to her portion; but what fortune
does &s;he bring you?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Nay, as to fortune&endq; &s;ays Robert,
&startq;&s;he is rich enough; I am &s;atisfied in
that point: but it is I that am not able
to come up to her terms, and &s;he is po|&s;itive
&s;he will not have me without.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Madam,&endq; &s;ays the &s;econd &s;i&s;ter, &startq;it
is impo&s;&s;ible to be &s;erious with him; he
will never give a direct an&s;wer to any
thing; you had better let him alone,
and talk no more of it to him; you
know how to di&s;po&s;e of her out of his
<PB N="61" REF="69">
way, if you think there is any thing in
it.&endq;</P>
<P>Robert was a little warm with his
&s;i&s;ter's rudene&s;s, but he was even with
her; and yet with good manners too.</P>
<P>&startq;There are two &s;orts of people, ma|dam,&endq;
&s;ays he, turning to his mother,
&startq;that there is no contending with; that
is, a wi&s;e body and a fool; it is a little
hard I &s;hould engage with both of them
together.&endq;</P>
<P>The younger &s;i&s;ter then &s;aid, &startq;We
mu&s;t be fools, indeed, in my brother's
opinion, that he &s;hould think we can
believe, he has &s;eriou&s;ly a&s;ked Mrs. Let|ty
to marry him, and that &s;he has re|fu&s;ed
him.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;An&s;wer, and an&s;wer not, &s;ays So|lomon,&endq;
replied he; &startq;when your bro|ther
had &s;aid to your mother, that he
had a&s;ked her no le&s;s than five times,
and that it was &s;o, that &s;he po&s;itively
denied him, methinks a younger &s;i&s;ter
need not que&s;tion the truth, when her
mother did not.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My mother, you &s;ee, did not un|der&s;tand
it,&endq; &s;ays the &s;econd &s;i&s;ter.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="70">
&startq;There is &s;ome difference,&endq; &s;ays Ro|ber,
&startq;between de&s;iring me to explain
it, and telling me &s;he did not believe
it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, but &s;on,&endq; &s;ays the old lady,
&startq;if you are di&s;po&s;ed to let us into the
my&s;tery of it: What were the&s;e hard
conditions?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, madam,&endq; &s;ays Robert, &startq;I
had done it before now, if the teazers
here had not worried me by the way of
interruption: the conditions are, that I
bring my father and you to con&s;ent to
it, and without that, &s;he prote&s;ts &s;he
will never &s;ee me more upon that &s;ub|ject;
and the&s;e conditions, as I &s;aid, I
&s;uppo&s;e I &s;hall never be able to grant.
I hope my warm &s;i&s;ters will be an&s;wered
now, and $u&s;h a little; if not, I have
no more to &s;ay, till I hear farther.&endq;</P>
<P>This an&s;wer was &s;urpri&s;ing to them
all, though le&s;s to the mother, becau&s;e
of what I had &s;aid to her. As to the
daughters they &s;tood &s;ilent a great while;
but the mother &s;aid with &s;ome warmth,</P>
<P>&startq;Well, I had heard this before, but I
could not believe it; but if it is &s;o,
then we have all done Letty wrong, and
<PB N="63" REF="71">
&s;he has behaved better than I ever ex|pected.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Nay,&endq; &s;ays the elder &s;i&s;ter, &startq;if
it is &s;o, &s;he has acted hand&s;omely, in|deed.&endq;</P>
<P>I confe&s;s,&endq; &s;ays the mother, &startq;it
was none of her fault; if he was fool
enough to take a fancy to her; but to
give &s;uch an an&s;wer to him, &s;hews more
re&s;pect to your father and me, than I
can tell how to expre&s;s; I &s;hall value
the girl the better for it, as long as I
know her.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But I &s;hall not,&endq; &s;ays Robert, &startq;un|le&s;s
you give your con&s;ent.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I will con&s;ider of that,&endq; &s;ays the
mother: &startq;I a&s;&s;ure you, if there were
not &s;ome other objections, this conduct
of her's would go a great away to bring
me to con&s;ent.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I wi&s;h it would go quite through
with it,&endq; &s;ays Robert; &startq;if you had as
much thought about making me ea&s;y, as
you have about making me rich, you
would &s;oon con&s;ent to it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, &s;on Robert, are you really
in earne&s;t? would you &s;o fain have her
as you pretend?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="72">
&startq;Really, madam,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;I think
it is hard you &s;hould que&s;tion me &s;o, af|ter

will have her: how can I re&s;olve that
point, when you &s;ee I cannot have her
without your con&s;ent? be&s;ides, I am
not bound to marry at all: but this I
will &s;ay I am earne&s;t in, that I will ne|ver
have any body el&s;e: &s;o you may de|termine
for me, Letty, or nobody, is
the word; and the que&s;tion which of the
two &s;hall be in your brea&s;t to decide
madam; provided only, that my good|humoured
&s;i&s;ters here, may have no
vote in it.&endq;</P>
<P>All this was dreadful to me, for the
mother began to yield, and Robert pre&s;&s;|ed
her home in it; on the other hand,
&s;he advi&s;ed with the elde&s;t &s;on, and he
u&s;ed all the arguments he was ma&s;ter of
to per&s;ude her to con&s;ent; alledging
his brother's pa&s;&s;ionate love for me, and
my generous regard to the family, in re|fu&s;ing
my own advantages upon &s;uch
a nice point of honour, and a thou&s;and
&s;uch, things: and as to the father, he
was a man in a hurry of public affairs,
and getting money, &s;eldom at home,
<PB N="65" REF="73">
thoughtful of the main-chance; but left
all tho&s;e things to his wife.</P>
<P>You may ea&s;ily believe, that when
the plot was thus, as they imagined,
broke out, that every one thought they
knew how things were carried: it was
not &s;o difficult or &s;o dangerous, for the
elder brother, who nobody &s;u&s;pected of
any thing, to have a freer acce&s;s to me
than before: nay, the mother, which
was ju&s;t as he wi&s;hed, propo&s;ed it to
him to talk with me; &startq;for it may be,
&s;on, you may &s;ee farther into the thing
than I; and &s;ee if you think &s;he has
been &s;o po&s;itive as Robert &s;ays &s;he has
been, or no.&endq;</P>
<P>This was as well as he could wi&s;h,
and he as it were yielding to talk with
me at his mother's reque&s;t, &s;he brought
me to him into her chamber; told me
her &s;on James had &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s with
me, at her reque&s;t, and de&s;ired me to
be very &s;incere with him; and then &s;he
left us both together, and he went and
&s;hut the door after her.</P>
<P>He then came and took me in his
arms and ki&s;&s;ed me very tenderly; but
told me, he had a long di&s;cour&s;e to hold
<PB N="66" REF="74">
with me, and it was now come to that
cri&s;is, that I &s;hould make my&s;elf happy
or mi&s;erable, as long as I lived: that
the affair was now gone &s;o far, that if I
could not comply with his de&s;ire, we
&s;hould be both ruined: then he told me
the whole &s;tory as has been related.
&startq;And now, my dear,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;con|&s;ider
what it will be to marry a gentle|man
of a good family, and with the
con&s;ent of the whole hou&s;e, and to en|joy
all that the world can give you: and
what on the other hand, to be &s;unk in|to
the dark circum&s;tances of a woman
that has lo&s;t her reputation; and that,
though I &s;hall be a private friend to you
while I live, yet, as I &s;hall be &s;u&s;pected
always, &s;o you will be afraid to &s;ee me,
and I &s;hall be afraid to own you.&endq;</P>
<P>He gave me no time to reply, but
went on with me thus: &startq;What has
happened between us, &s;o long as we
both agree to do &s;o, may be buried and
forgotten: I &s;hall always be your &s;incere
friend, without any inclination to nearer
intimacy, when you become my &s;i&s;ter,
and we &s;hall have all the hone&s;t part of
conver&s;ation without any reproaches be|tween
<PB N="67" REF="75">
us, of having done ami&s;s. I beg
of you to con&s;ider it, and do not &s;tand
in the way of your own &s;afety and pro&s;|perity;
and to &s;atisfy you that I am &s;in|cere,
I here offer you five hundred
pounds to make you &s;ome amends for
the freedoms I have taken with you,
which we &s;hall look upon as &s;ome of
the follies of our lives, which it is hoped
we may repent of.&endq;</P>
<P>He &s;poke this in &s;o much more mov|ing
terms than it is po&s;&s;ible for me to
expre&s;s, and much greater force of ar|gument
than I can repeat, that I only
recommend it to tho&s;e who read my
&s;tory, to &s;uppo&s;e, that as he held me
above an hour and half in that di&s;cour&s;e,
&s;o he an&s;wered my objections with all the
arguments that human wit and art could
devi&s;e.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;ay, however, that any thing
he &s;aid made impre&s;&s;ion enough upon
me, &s;o as to give me any thought of the
matter; till he told me at la&s;t very plain|ly,
that if I refu&s;ed, he was &s;orry to
add, that he could never go on with me
in that &s;tation as we &s;tood before; that
though he loved me as well as ever, and
<PB N="68" REF="76">
that I was as agreeable to him, as ever,
yet, &s;en&s;e of virtue had not &s;o far for|&s;aken
him, as to &s;uffer him to take free|doms
with a woman that his brother
courted to make his wife; and if he
took his leave of me, with a denial in
this affair, whatever he might do for me in
the point of &s;upport, grounded on his
fir&s;t engagement of maintaining me, yet
he would not have me be &s;urpri&s;ed, that
he was obliged to tell me, he could not
allow him&s;elf &s;uch liberties any more,
and that I could not expect it of him.</P>
<P>I received this la&s;t part with &s;ome to|kens
of &s;urpri&s;e and di&s;order, and much
ado, to avoid &s;inking; for, indeed, I
loved him to an extravagance, not ea&s;y
to imagine; but he perceived my di&s;or|der,
he entreated me to con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;|ly
of it, a&s;&s;ured me, that it was the on|ly
way to pre&s;erve our mutual affection;
that in this &s;tation we might love as
friends, with the utmo&s;t pa&s;&s;ion, and
with a love of relation untainted, free
from our ju&s;t reproaches, and free from
other peoples &s;u&s;picions; that he &s;hould
ever acknowledge his happine&s;s owing to
me; that he would be debtor to me as
<PB N="69" REF="77">
long as he lived, and would be paying
that debt as long as he had breath. Thus
he wrought me up, in &s;hort, to a he&s;i|tation
in the matter: having the dan|gers
on one &s;ide repre&s;ented in lively fi|fiures,
and, indeed, heightened by my
imagination of being turned out to the
wide world a mere ca&s;t-off mi&s;tre&s;s,
for it was no le&s;s, and perhaps expo&s;ed
as &s;uch; with little to provide for my|&s;elf;
with no friend, no acquaintance in
the whole world, out of that town, and
there I could not pretend to &s;tay; all
this terrified me to the la&s;t degree, and
he took care upon all occa&s;ions to lay it
home to me, in the wor&s;t colours that it
could be po&s;&s;ible to be drawn in. On
the other hand, he failed not to &s;et
forth the ea&s;y pro&s;perous life, which I
was going to live.</P>
<P>He an&s;wered all that I could object
from affection, and from former engage|ments,
with telling me the nece&s;&s;ity that
was before us of taking our mea&s;ures
now; and as to his promi&s;es of mar|riage,
the nature of things, he &s;aid, had
put an end to that, by the probability
of my being his brother's wife, before
<PB N="70" REF="78">
the time to which his promi&s;es all re|ferred.</P>
<P>Thus in a word, I may &s;ay, he rea|&s;oned
me out of my rea&s;on; he con|quered
all my arguments, and I began
to &s;ee a danger that I was in, which I
had not con&s;idered of before, and that
was, of being dropped by both of them,
and left alone in the world to &s;hift for
my&s;elf.</P>
<P>He having thus managed me, his next
bu&s;ine&s;s was to manage his mother; and
he never left her till he had brought her
to acquie&s;ce, and be pa&s;&s;ive in the thing,
even without acquainting his father,
other than by letters: &s;o that &s;he con|&s;ented
to our marrying privately, and
leaving her to manage his father after|wards.</P>
<P>Robert, having obtained his mother's
con&s;ent, came big with the news to me,
and related the whole &s;tory, with a &s;ince|rity
&s;o vi&s;ible, that I confe&s;s it grieved
me to think I was the in&s;trument to
abu&s;e &s;o hone&s;t a young gentleman; but
there was no remedy: he would have
me, and I was not obliged to acquaint
him with all I knew, though I had no
<PB N="71" REF="79">
other way to put him off; &s;o I came
gradually into it, to his &s;atisfaction, and,
accordingly we were married.</P>
<P>It concerns the &s;tory very little, to en|ter
into the farther particulars of the fa|mily,
or of my&s;elf, for the five years
that I lived with my hu&s;band; only to
ob&s;erve that I had two children by him,
and that at the end of five years he died.
He had been really a very good hu&s;band
to me, and we lived very agreeably to|gether;
but as he had not received much
from them, and had, in the little time he
lived, acquired no great matters, &s;o my
circum&s;tances were not much mended
by the match: indeed, I had pre&s;erved
the elder brother's bonds to me, to pay
me 500l. which he offered me for my
con&s;ent to marry his brother; and this,
with what I had &s;aved of the money he
formerly gave me, and as much more
by my hu&s;band, left me a widow with
about 1200l.</P>
<P>My two children were indeed taken
happily off my hands by my hu&s;band's
father and mother, and that was all
they got by me.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="80">
Before my hu&s;band died, his elder
brother was married, and we being then
removed to London, were written to by
the old lady to come and be at the wed|ding.
My hu&s;band went; but I pretend|ed
indi&s;po&s;ition, and that I could not
po&s;&s;ibly travel, &s;o I &s;taid behind; for in
&s;hort, I could not bear the &s;ight of his
being given to another woman, though
I knew I was never to have him my|&s;elf.</P>
<P>I was now left loo&s;e to the world, and
being &s;till young and hand&s;ome, as every
body &s;aid of me, and I a&s;&s;ure you, I
thought my&s;elf &s;o, and with a tolerable
fortune, I put no &s;mall value upon my|&s;elf.
I was courted by &s;everal con&s;ider|able
tradefmen; and particularly, very
warmly by one, a linen-draper, at who&s;e
hou&s;e, after my hu&s;band's death, I took
a lodging, his &s;i&s;ter being my acquaint|ance:
here I had all the liberty, and all
the opportunity to be gay, and appear
in company that I could de&s;ire. My
landlord's &s;i&s;ter being an extreme gay
woman, and not &s;o much mi&s;tre&s;s of her
virtue, as I thought at fir&s;t &s;he had
been, &s;he brought me into a world of
<PB N="73" REF="81">
company, and even brought home &s;e+veral
per&s;ons, &s;uch as &s;he liked well
enough to gratify, to &s;ee her pretty wi|dow,
&s;o &s;he was plea&s;ed to call me, and
that name I got in a little time in pub|lick.
Now, as Fame and Fools make
an a&s;&s;embly, I was here wonderfully
care&s;&s;ed; had abundance of admirers,
and &s;uch as called them&s;elves Lovers;
but I found not one fair propo&s;al among
them all: as for their common de&s;ign,
I under&s;tood too well to be drawn
into any more &s;nares of that kind. The
ca&s;e was altered with me: I had money
in my pocket, and had nothing to &s;ay to
them. I had been tricked once by that
$heat called Love, but the game was
over; I was re&s;olved now to be married,
or nothing; and to be well married, or
at all.</P>
<P>I loved the company, indeed, of men
of mirth and wit, men of gallantry and
&s;igure, and was often entertained with
&s;uch, as I was al&s;o with others; but I
found by ob&s;ervation, that the brighte&s;t
men came upon the dulle&s;t errand; that
is to &s;ay, the dulle&s;t, as to what I aim|ed
at: on the other hand, tho&s;e who
<PB N="74" REF="82">
came with the be&s;t propo&s;als, were the
dulle&s;t and mo&s;t di&s;agreeable part of the
world. I was not aver&s;e to a trade&s;man;
but then I would have a trade&s;man, that
was &s;omething of a gentleman too.</P>
<P>At la&s;t I found a gentleman-trade&s;|man;
and, as a ju&s;t plague upon my
folly, I was catched in the very &s;nare,
which, as I may &s;ay, I laid for ano|ther.</P>
<P>This was a draper too, for though my
female acquaintance would have brought
me to a bargain with her brother, yet
when it came to the point, it was it
&s;eems for a mi&s;tre&s;s, not a wife; and I
kept true to this notion, that a woman
&s;hould never be kept for a mi&s;tre&s;s, that
had money to keep her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Thus my pride, not my principle, my
money, nor my virtue, kept me hone&s;t;
though, as it proved, I found I had
much better have been &s;old by my fe|male
friend to her brother, than have
&s;old my&s;elf as I did to one who was a
rake, gentleman, &s;hop-keeper, and beg|gar
all together.</P>
<P>But I was hurried on to ruin my&s;elf
in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t manner that ever woman
<PB N="75" REF="83">
did; for my hu&s;band coming to a &s;um
of money at once, fell into &s;uch a pro|fu&s;ion
of expence, that all I had, and
all he had before, if he had any thing
worth mentioning, would not have held
it out long.</P>
<P>He was very fond of me for about
a quarter of a year, and what I got by
that, was, that I had the plea&s;ure of
&s;eeing a great deal of my money &s;pent
upon my&s;elf, and as I may &s;ay, had
&s;ome of the &s;pending it too. &startq;Come,
my dear,&endq; &s;ays he to me one day, &startq;&s;hall
we go and take a journey in the coun|try
for about a week?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ay, my love,&endq; &s;ays I; &startq;where
would you go?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I care not whither,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;but
I have a mind to go to Oxford;&endq; and to
Oxford we went, and a very plea&s;ant
journey we had; and in about twelve
days came home again, after &s;pending
near fifty pounds.</P>
<P>Vanity is the perfection of a fop:
my hu&s;band had this excellence, and as
his hi&s;tory you may be &s;ure, has little
weight in it, it is enough to tell you,
<PB N="76" REF="84">
that in about two years and a quarter he
was arre&s;ted.</P>
<P>It was no &s;urpri&s;e to me, for I had
fore&s;een &s;ome time that all was going to
wreck, and had been taking care to re|&s;erve
&s;omething if I could, though it
was not much for my&s;elf: but when he
&s;ent for me, he behaved much better
than I expected, and told me, he had
played the fool and &s;uffered him&s;elf to
be &s;urpri&s;ed which he might have pre|vented;
that now he fore&s;aw he could
not &s;tand it, and therefore he would have
me go home, take away every thing I
had in the hou&s;e of any value and &s;e|cure
it; and after that, he told me,
that &startq;if I could get away the goods
out of the &s;hop, I &s;hould do it; only
let me know nothing of it, neither what
you take, or whither you carry them;
for as for me, I am re&s;olved to get out
of this hou&s;e and be gone; and if you
never hear of me more, my dear, I wi&s;h
you well; I am only &s;orry for the inju|ry
I have done you.&endq;</P>
<P>He &s;aid &s;ome very hand&s;ome things
to me at parting; for I told you he was
a gentleman, and that was all the benefit
<PB N="77" REF="85">
I had of his being &s;o; that he u&s;ed me
very hand&s;omely, and with good man|ners
upon all occa&s;ions, even to the la&s;t,
only &s;pent all I had, and left me to rob
the creditors for &s;omething to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on.</P>
<P>However, I did as he bade me, and
having thus taken my leave of him, I
never &s;aw him more; for he found
means to break out of the bailiff's
hou&s;e that night, and for the re&s;t the
creditors &s;crambled for it as well as they
could: how I knew not, for I could
come at no knowlege of any thing, more
than this; that he having rai&s;ed what
money he could get together, he got
over to France, from whence I had one
or two letters from him, and no more.</P>
<P>My hu&s;band was &s;o civil to me, for
&s;till I &s;ay, he was much of a gentleman,
that in the fir&s;t letter from France, he
let me know where he had pawn|ed
twenty pieces of fine Holland for
thirty pounds, and inclo&s;ed the to|ken,
and an order for taking them
up, which I did, and made in time a|bove
an hundred pounds of them, hav|ing
lei&s;ure to cut them and &s;ell them,
to private families as opportunity offered.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="86">
However, with all this, and all that
I had &s;ecured before, I found, upon ca&s;t|ing
things up, my ca&s;e was very much
altered, and my fortune much le&s;&s;ened;
for including the hollands, and a parcel
of fine mu&s;lins, which I carried off be|fore,
and &s;ome plate, and other things,
I found I could hardly mu&s;ter up five hun|dred
pounds, and my condition was very
odd, for though I had no child, I had had
one by him, but it died, yet I was a wi|dow
betwitched; I had a hu&s;band and
no hu&s;band, and I could not pretend to
marry again, though I knew well enough
my hu&s;band would never &s;ee England
any more, if he lived fifty years: thus,
I &s;ay, I was limited from marriage, what
offer &s;oever might be made me; and I
had not one friend to advi&s;e with, in the
condition I was in, at lea&s;t not one I
dur&s;t tru&s;t the &s;ecret of my circum|&s;tances
to: for if the commi&s;&s;ioners were
to have been informed where I was,
I &s;hould have been fetched up, and exa|mined
upon oath, and all I had &s;aved
be taken away from me.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e apprehen&s;ions the fir&s;t
thing I did, was to go by another name:
<PB N="79" REF="87">
this I did effectually, for I took lodg|ings
in a very private part of the town,
dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf in the habit of a widow,
and went by the name of Flanders.
This though a pre&s;ent relief, in conceal|ing
my&s;elf from the creditors, yet the
name which I had a&s;&s;umed, occa&s;ioned
a reflection hereafter that &s;hall be related
in its proper place<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Note upon this account, &s;he took upon her|&s;elf the name of Flanders.</NOTE></P>
<P>I &s;oon made an acquaintance with a
very &s;ober good &s;ort of a woman, who
was really a widow, but in better cir|cum&s;tances;
her hu&s;band had been a
captain of a merchant &s;hip, and having
had the misfortune to be ca&s;t away com|ing
home on a voyage from the We&s;t-Indies,
which would have been very
profitable if he had come &s;afe, was &s;o
reduced by the lo&s;s, that though he had
&s;aved his life then, it broke his heart and
killed him afterwards. She invited me
to be with her till I could &s;ettle to my
mind, or, as &s;he &s;aid, get a hu&s;band.</P>
<P>I accepted her offer, and was with her
half a year, and &s;hould have been longer;
but in that interval what &s;he propo&s;ed to
<PB N="80" REF="88">
me, happened to her&s;elf, and &s;he marri|ed
another captain very much to her
advantage, and who&s;e fortune was upon
the increa&s;e; mine &s;eemed to be upon
the wane.</P>
<P>As my &s;i&s;ter-in-law, at Colche&s;ter, &s;aid,
&startq;beauty, wit, manners, &s;en&s;e, good-hu|mour,
good behaviour, education, vir|tue,
or any other qualification, whether
of body or mind, had no power to re|commend.
Money only made a woman
agreeable: men cho&s;e mi&s;tre&s;&s;es indeed
by the heat of their affection, and it was
requi&s;ite for them to be hand&s;ome, well-&s;haped,
and a graceful behaviour; but
for a wife, no deformity would &s;hock
the fancy, no ill qualities the judg|ment;
the money was the thing; the
portion was neither crooked or mon|&s;trous,
but the money was always a|greeable,
whatever the wife was.&endq;</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances I was in, made
the offer of a good hu&s;band the mo&s;t
nece&s;&s;ary thing in the world to me; but
it &s;oon began to be rumoured that I
had no fortune, and to &s;ay this, was to
&s;ay all that was ill of me; and I was
dropt in all the di&s;cour&s;es of matrimo|ny:
<PB N="81" REF="89">
tho' I was allowed to be well-bred,
hand&s;ome, witty, mode&s;t and agreeable;
yet, all the&s;e would not do without the
one thing needful, which was now be|come
more valuable than virtue it&s;elf.
In &s;hort, &startq;the widow,&endq; they &s;aid, &startq;had
no money.&endq;</P>
<P>I re&s;olved, therefore, as to the &s;tate of
my pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, that it was
ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to change my &s;ta|tion,
and make a new appearance in
&s;ome other place where I was not known,
and even to pa&s;s by another name if I
found occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I communicated my thoughts to my
intimate friend the captain's lady, who
was as ready to &s;erve me as I could de|&s;ire.
I made no &s;cruple to lay my cir|cum&s;tances
open to her. I told her I
had about five hundred pounds, a great
many very rich clothes, a gold watch,
and &s;ome jewels, though of no extraor|dinary
value.</P>
<P>She &s;aid if I would be ruled by her I
&s;hould certainly get a hu&s;band of for|tune,
without leaving him any room to
reproach me. I an&s;wered her, as I had
rea&s;on to do, that I would give up my|&s;elf
<PB N="82" REF="90">
wholly to her directions, and that
I would have neither tongue to &s;peak,
or feet to &s;tep, in that affair, but as
&s;he &s;hould direct me; depending that
&s;he would extricate me out of eve|ry
difficulty that &s;he brought me in|to,
which &s;he &s;aid &s;he would an&s;wer
for.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;tep &s;he put me upon, was
to call her cou&s;in, and go to a relation's
of her's in the country, where &s;he di|rected
me, and where &s;he brought her
hu&s;band to vi&s;it me: and calling me
cou&s;in, &s;he worked matters &s;o about,
that her hu&s;band and &s;he together in|vited
me to come to town and be with
them, for they now lived in a different
place from where they were before.
She acquainted her hu&s;band, that I
had at lea&s;t two thou&s;and pounds for|tune,
and that after &s;ome of my re|lations
I was like to have a great deal
more.</P>
<P>It was enough to tell her hu&s;band this,
there needed nothing on my &s;ide; I was
but to &s;it &s;till and wait the event, for it
pre&s;ently went all over the neighbour|hood
that the young widow at Captain
<PB N="83" REF="91">
Jolly's had at lea&s;t two thou&s;and pounds,
and perhaps a great deal more, and that
the captain &s;aid &s;o; and if the cap|tain
was a&s;ked at any time about me, he
made no &s;cruple to affirm it, though he
knew not one word of the matter, than
that his wife had told him &s;o; and in
this he thought no harm, for he really
believed it to be &s;o, becau&s;e he had it
from his wife; &s;o &s;lender a foundation
will men build upon, if they do but
think there is a fortune in the way.
With the reputation of this fortune, a
Mr. Bennet, a rich Virginia planter,
a very agreeable man, made his addre&s;&s;es
to me, and told me as I was a woman of
his choice, he hoped I would make him
happy in accepting of him for a hu&s;|band:
this I imagined was upon &s;up|po&s;ition
that I was very rich, though I
had never told him a word of it my&s;elf;
and pretended, on all occa&s;ions, to doubt
his &s;incerity; and, added, perhaps he
only courted me in expectation of my
being a fortune.</P>
<P>He replied, though not verbally, by
pulling off his diamond ring, and writes
<PB N="84" REF="92">
upon the gla&s;s of the &s;a&s;h in my cham|ber,
<Q>You I love, and you alone.</Q>
I read it, and wrote under it,
<Q>And &s;o, in love, &s;ays every one.</Q>
He takes his ring again, and writes,
<Q>Virtue alone is an e&s;tate.</Q>
I added,
<Q>But money's virtue; gold is fate.</Q>
He coloured as red as fire to &s;ee me turn
&s;o quick upon him, and told me he
would conquer me, and writes,
<Q>I &s;corn your gold, yet you I love.</Q>
I ventured all upon the la&s;t ca&s;t of poe|try,
and I wrote,
<Q>I'm poor: let's &s;ee how kind you'll prove.</Q>
This was a &s;ad truth to me: whether he
believed me or no I could not tell; I
&s;uppo&s;ed then that he did not. How|ever,
he flew to me, took me in his
arms, and ki&s;&s;ing me very eagerly, and
with the greate&s;t warmth imaginable, he
held me fa&s;t till he called for a pen and
<PB N="85" REF="93">
ink, and then told me could not wait
the tedious writing on the gla&s;s, but
pulling out a piece of paper, he began
and wrote again,
<Q>Be mine, with all your poverty.</Q>
I took his pen and followed him imme|diately
thus,
<Q>Yet, &s;ecretly, you hope I lie.</Q>
He told me that was unkind, becau&s;e
it was not ju&s;t, and that I put him upon
contradicting me, which did not con&s;i&s;t
with good-manners, any more than with
his affection; and, therefore, &s;ince I had
in&s;en&s;ibly drawn him into this poetical
&s;cribble, he begged I would not oblige
him to break it off; &s;o he writes again,
<Q>Yet love alone be our debate.</Q>
I an&s;wered.
<Q>She loves enough, that does not hate.</Q>
This he took for a favour, and &s;o laid
down the pen. I &s;ay, he took it for a
favour, and a mighty one it was, if he
had known all: however, he took it as I
meant it, that is, to let him think I
<PB N="86" REF="94">
was inclined to go on with him, as in|deed
I had all the rea&s;on in the world to
do, for he was the be&s;t-humoured merry
&s;ort of a man that ever I met with; and
I often reflected on my&s;elf, how doubly
criminal it was to deceive him; but that
nece&s;&s;ity, which pre&s;&s;ed me to a &s;ettle|ment
&s;uitable to my condition, was my
authority for it: and certainly his affec|tion
to me, and the goodne&s;s of his
temper, however they might argue a|gain&s;t
u&s;ing him ill, yet they &s;trongly
argued to me, that he would better take
the di&s;appointment, than &s;ome fiery-tem|pered
wretch, who might have nothing
to recommend him but tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions
which would &s;erve only to make a wo|man
mi&s;erable all her days.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, though I had je&s;ted with him,
as he &s;uppo&s;ed it, &s;o often about my
poverty; yet, whether he was in je&s;t or
in earne&s;t, he had declared he took me
without any regard to my portion; and
whether I was in je&s;t or in earne&s;t I had
declared my&s;elf to be very poor, &s;o that
in a word, I had him fa&s;t both ways;
and though he might &s;ay afterwards he
<PB N="87" REF="95">
was cheated, yet he could never &s;ay that
I had cheated him.</P>
<P>He pur&s;ued me clo&s;e after this, and
as I &s;aw there was no need to fear lo&s;ing
him, I played the indifferent part with
him longer than prudence might have
otherwi&s;e dictated to me: but I con&s;idered
how much this caution and indifference
would give me the advantage over him,
when I &s;hould come to be under the ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of owning my own circum&s;tances
to him; and I managed it the more
warily, becau&s;e I found he inferred from
thence, as indeed he ought to do, that
I either had the more money, or the
more judgment, and would not ven|ture.</P>
<P>I took the freedom one day, after we
had talked pretty clo&s;e on the &s;ubject, to
tell him, that it was true I had received
the compliment of a lover from him;
namely, that he would take me without
enquiring into my fortune, and I would
make him a &s;uitable return in this, viz.
that I would make as little enquiry into
his as con&s;i&s;ted with rea&s;on, but I hoped
he would allow me to a&s;k a few que&s;|tions,
which he &s;hould an&s;wer or not as
<PB N="88" REF="96">
he thought fit; and that I would not be
offended if he did not an&s;wer me at all:
one of the&s;e que&s;tions related to our
manner of living, and the place where;
becau&s;e I had heard he had a great plan|tation
in Virginia, and that he had talk|ed
of going to live there.</P>
<P>He began from this di&s;cour&s;e to let
me voluntarily into his affairs, and to
tell me in a frank open way all his cir|cum&s;tances,
by which I found he was
very well to pa&s;s in the world; but that
great part of his e&s;tate con&s;i&s;ted of three
plantations which he had in Virginia,
which brought him in a very good in|come,
generally &s;peaking three hun|dred
pounds a year; but that if he was
to live upon them, would bring him
twice as much.</P>
<P>I told him I had good rea&s;on not to
de&s;ire to go there to live, becau&s;e if his
plantations were worth &s;o much, I had
not a fortune &s;uitable to a gentleman of
&s;ix hundred pounds a year, as he &s;aid
his e&s;tate would be.</P>
<P>He replied generou&s;ly, he did not a&s;k
what my fortune was, he had told me
from the beginning he would not, and
<PB N="89" REF="97">
he would be as good as his word; but
whatever it was, he a&s;&s;ured me he would
never de&s;ire me to go to Virginia with
him, or go thither him&s;elf without me,
unle&s;s I was perfectly willing, and made
it my choice.</P>
<P>To be brief, in a &s;hort time after this
we were married, and very happily mar|ried
on my &s;ide I a&s;&s;ure you, as to the
man; for he was the be&s;t-humoured
creature that ever woman had.</P>
<P>Now I was painfully put to it to bring
him the little &s;tock I had, and to let
him &s;ee it was no more; but there was
a nece&s;&s;ity for it, &s;o I took my oppor|tunity
one day when we were alone, and
&s;aid, &startq;My dear, we have been married
this fortnight, is it not time to let you
know whether you have got a wife with
&s;omething, or with nothing?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Your own time for that, my dear,&endq;
&s;ays he. &startq;I am &s;atisfied that I have got
the wife I love, I have not troubled you
much, with my enquiry after it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That is true,&endq; &s;aid I; &startq;but I have
a great difficulty upon me about it, which
I &s;carce know how to manage.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What is that, my dear?&endq; &s;ays he.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="98">
&startq;Why,&endq; &s;ays I, &startq;it is a little hard
upon me, and it is harder upon you; I
am told that captain Jolly has informed
you I had a great deal more money than
I ever pretended to have, and I am &s;ure
I never employed him to do &s;o.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;captain Jolly
may have told me &s;o; but what then? if
you have not &s;o much, that may lie at
his door, but you never told me what
you had, &s;o I have no rea&s;on to blame
you if you have nothing at all.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That is &s;o ju&s;t,&endq; &s;aid I, &startq;and &s;o
generous, that it makes my having but
a little a double affliction to me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The le&s;s you have, my dear,&endq; &s;ays
he, &startq;the wor&s;e for us both; but I hope
the affliction you &s;peak of, is not cau&s;ed
for fear I &s;hould be unkind to you; no,
no, if you have nothing tell me plain|ly,
and at once. I may perhaps tell the
captain he has cheated me; but I can
never &s;ay that you have, for did you
not give it under your hand that you
were poor? and &s;o I ought to expect you
to be.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, my dear, I am glad I have
not been concerned in deceiving you:
<PB N="91" REF="99">
that I am poor is too true, but not &s;o
poor as to have nothing neither; &s;o I
pulled out &s;ome bank bills, and gave
him about a hundred and &s;ixty pounds.&endq;</P>
<P>I had brought him &s;o near to expect
nothing, by what I had &s;aid before, that
he owned it was more than he looked
for; and he did not que&s;tion by my di&s;|cour&s;e
to him, but that my fine cloaths,
gold watch, and a diamond ring or two
had been all my fortune.</P>
<P>Thus I got over the fraud of cheat|ing
a man into marrying me on pre|tence
of a fortune; which, by the way,
I take to be one of the mo&s;t dangerous
&s;teps a woman can take, and in which
&s;he runs the mo&s;t hazard of being ill
u&s;ed afterwards.</P>
<P>My hu&s;band, to give him his due,
was a man of infinite good-nature; but
being under a di&s;appointment in his re|turn
of his plantations, he di&s;covered
many times his inclination of going over
to Virginia to live upon his e&s;tate; and
often would he magnify the way of liv|ing
there, how cheap, how plentiful,
and how plea&s;ant it was!</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="100">
I began pre&s;ently to under&s;tand his
meaning, and I took him up very plain|ly
one morning, and told him that I did
&s;o; that his e&s;tate turned to little ac|count
at this di&s;tance, compared to what
it would do if he lived upon the &s;pot,
and that I found he had a mind to go
and live there; and I added, that I was
&s;en&s;ible he had been di&s;appointed in me,
and that finding his expectations not an|&s;wered
that way, I could do no le&s;s to
make him amends than tell him, that I
was very willing to go over to Virginia
with him and live there.</P>
<P>He &s;aid a thou&s;and kind things to me
upon the &s;ubject of my making &s;uch a
propo&s;al to him: and added, that how|ever
he was di&s;appointed in his expec|tations
of a fortune, he was not di&s;ap|pointed
in a wife; and that I was all to
him that a wife could be, and he was
more than &s;atisfied in the whole when the
particulars were put together; but that
this offer was &s;o kind, that it was more
than he could expre&s;s.</P>
<P>Accordingly we agreed to go. He told
me he had a very good hou&s;e there,
that it was well furni&s;hed, that his mo|ther
<PB N="93" REF="101">
was alive and lived in it, and one
&s;i&s;ter, which was all the relations he
had; that as &s;oon as he came there, his
mother would remove to another hou&s;e
which was her own for life, and his af|ter
her decea&s;e; &s;o that I &s;hould have all
the hou&s;e to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>To make this part of the &s;tory &s;hort,
we put on board a large quantity of good
furniture for our hou&s;e, with &s;tores of
linnen and other nece&s;&s;aries, and a good
cargo for &s;ale, and away we went.</P>
<P>To give an account of the manner of
our voyage, which was long and full
of dangers, is out of my way, I kept
no journal, neither did my hu&s;band;
all that I can &s;ay is, that after a terrible
pa&s;&s;age, frighted twice with dreadful
&s;torms, and once with what was &s;till
more terrible, I mean a pirate, who came
on board and took away almo&s;t all our
provi&s;ions; and which would have been
beyond all to me, they had once taken
my hu&s;band to go along with them, but
by entreaties were prevailed with to leave
him; I &s;ay, after all the&s;e terrible things,
we arrived in York River in Virginia, and
coming to our plantation, we were re|ceived
<PB N="94" REF="102">
with all the demon&s;trations of
tenderne&s;s and affection by my hu&s;band's
mother, that were po&s;&s;ible to be expre&s;&s;|ed.</P>
<P>We lived here all together, my mo|ther-in-law,
who mu&s;t have been a beau|tiful
woman in her prime, at my entreaty,
continuing in the hou&s;e, for &s;he was too
kind a mother to be parted with; my
hu&s;band likewi&s;e continued the &s;ame as
at fir&s;t, and I thought my&s;elf the hap|pie&s;t
creature alive; when a &s;urpri&s;ing
event put an end to all that felici|ty
in a moment, and rendered my con|dition
the mo&s;t uncomfortable, if not
the mo&s;t mi&s;erable in the world.</P>
<P>My mother-in-law was a mighty chear|ful
good-humoured old woman, I may
call her an old woman, for her &s;on was
above thirty; I &s;ay &s;he was very plea|&s;ant,
good company, and u&s;ed to enter|tain
me with abundance of &s;tories to
divert me, as well of the country we
were in, as the people.</P>
<P>Among the re&s;t, &s;he told me how the
greate&s;t part of the inhabitants of the
colony came thither in very indifferent
circum&s;tances from England; that ge|nerally
<PB N="95" REF="103">
&s;peaking they were of two &s;orts,
fir&s;t, &s;uch as were brought over by ma|&s;ters
of ships to be &s;old as &s;ervants, &s;uch
we call them, my dear, but they are
more properly called &s;laves: or, &s;econd|ly,
&s;uch as are transported from Newgate
and other pri&s;ons, after having been
found guilty of felony and crimes pu|ni&s;hable
with death.</P>
<P>&startq;When they come here,&endq; &s;ays &s;he,
&startq;we make no difference,&endq; the planters
buy them, and they work together in the
field till their time is out: when it is ex|pired,
they have encouragement given
them to plant for themselves; for they
have a certain number of acres of land
allotted them by the country, and they
go to work to clear and cure the land,
and then to plant it with tobacco and
corn for their own u&s;e; and as the trade&s;|men
and merchants will tru&s;t them with
tools and cloaths, and other necessaries,
upon the credit of their crop before it
is grown, &s;o they again plant every year
a little more than the year before, and
buy whatever they want with the crop
that is before them.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="104">
&startq;Hence child, many become great
men, and we have,&endq; continued &s;he, &startq;&s;e|veral
justices of the peace, officers of the
train bands, and magi&s;trates of the towns
they live in, that have been &s;ent from
your &s;ide of the water.&endq;</P>
<P>She was going on with that part of
the &s;tory, when her own part in it inter|rupted
her, and with a great deal of
good-humoured confidence &s;he told me,
&s;he was one of the &s;econd &s;ort of inha|bitants
her&s;elf: that &s;he one evening, at
the door of the Opera-hou&s;e, was de|tected
in being too familiar with a lady's
gold watch, for which &s;he was convict|ed;
but afterwards her &s;entence being
changed, &s;he was, &s;he ble&s;&s;ed God, &s;ent
hither for life.</P>
<P>This &s;tory, being &s;imilar to what I
had heard from my aunt Atkins of Col|che&s;ter,
my father's &s;i&s;ter, who brought
me up, moved me greatly; but my mo|ther,
&s;miling, &s;aid, &startq;You need not think
&s;uch a thing &s;trange, daughter, for, as I
told you, &s;ome of the be&s;t men in this
county were brought here on the &s;ame
account, and they are not a&s;hamed to
own it; there is major Sly, he was an
<PB N="97" REF="105">
eminent pickpocket; and ju&s;tice Burg|lary
was a &s;hoplifter, and both of them
have rea&s;on to thank the ALMIGHTY for
the sentence they received.&endq;</P>
<P>Here &s;he went on with her own &s;tory,
and in &s;o particular a manner, that I be|gan
to be very unea&s;y, but coming to
one particular that required telling her
name, and pronouncing Atkins, I thought
I &s;hould have &s;unk down in the place.
She perceived I was out of order, and
a&s;ked me if I was not well, and what
ailed me? I told her I was &s;o affected
with the melancholy &s;tory &s;he had told,
and the terrible things &s;he had gone
through, that it had overcome me; and
I begged of her to talk no more of
it.</P>
<P>&startq;Why, my dear,&endq; &s;ays &s;he, &startq;very
kindly, what need the&s;e things trouble
you? The&s;e pa&s;&s;ages were long before
your time, and they give me no trouble
at all now; nay, I look back on them
with a particular &s;atisfaction, as they
have been a means to bring me to this
place.&endq; Then &s;he went on to tell me
how &s;he very luckily fell into a good fa|mily,
where behaving her&s;elf well, and
<PB N="98" REF="106">
her mi&s;tre&s;s dying, her ma&s;ter, Mr. Ben|net,
married her, by whom &s;he had my
hu&s;band and his &s;i&s;ter, and that by her
diligence and good management after
her hu&s;band's death, &s;he had improved
the plantations to &s;uch a degree as they
then were, &s;o that mo&s;t of the e&s;tate was
of her getting, not her hu&s;band's, for
&s;he had been a widow upwards of
&s;ixteen years.</P>
<P>I heard this part of the &s;tory with ve|ry
little attention, becau&s;e I wanted much
to retire and give vent to my pa&s;&s;ions,
which I did &s;oon after; and let any one
judge what mu&s;t be the angui&s;h of my
mind, when I came to reflect, that this
was certainly no more or le&s;s than my
own mother.</P>
<P>I was now the mo&s;t unhappy of wo|men:
had the &s;tory never been told me,
all had been well; it had been no crime
to have lain with my hu&s;band, &s;ince as
to his being my relation, had I known
nothing of it.</P>
<P>Under this pre&s;&s;ure of mind, I re|vealed
all I knew to my mother, begged
her a&s;&s;i&s;tance in our &s;eparation, being
determined to leave the place.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="107">
It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the a&s;toni&s;h|ment
&s;he was in; &s;he took me about the
neck and ki&s;&s;ed me, crying mo&s;t vehe|mently
over me, without &s;peaking one
word for a long time; at la&s;t &s;he broke
out, &startq;Unhappy child! what mi&s;erable
chance could bring thee hither? and in
the arms of my own &s;on too! Dreadful
girl! why, we are all undone! Married
to thy own brother! three children, and
two alive, all of the &s;ame fle&s;h and blood!
My &s;on and my daughter lying together
as hu&s;band and wife! All confu&s;ion
and di&s;traction for ever! Mi&s;erable fa|mily!
what will become of us? what is
to be &s;aid? what is to be done? and
thus &s;he run on for a great while, nor
had I any power to &s;peak, or if I had,
did I know what to &s;ay, for every word
wounded me to the &s;oul. With this
kind of amazement &s;he promi&s;ed me that
&s;he would &s;ay nothing of it to her &s;on,
till we had talked of it again.</P>
<P>It was not long before we had a &s;e|cond
conference upon the &s;ame &s;ubject;
but then it was with this misfortune,
that my mother's opinion and mine were
quite different from one another; for
<PB N="100" REF="108">
my mother's opinion was, that I &s;hould
conceal the whole affair intirely, and
continue with him as my hu&s;band, till
&s;ome event &s;hould make the di&s;covery of
it convenient.</P>
<P>To encourage me to this, &s;he promi&s;|ed
to make me ea&s;y in my circum&s;tances,
and to leave me what &s;he could at her
death, &s;ecured for me &s;eparately from
my hu&s;band; &s;o that if it &s;hould come
out afterwards, I &s;hould not be left de|&s;titute,
but be able to &s;tand on my own
feet, and procure ju&s;tice from him.</P>
<P>This propo&s;al did not agree at all with
my judgment of the thing, though it
was very fair and kind in my mother;
but my thoughts run quite another
way.</P>
<P>As to keeping the &s;ecret in our own
brea&s;ts, and letting it all remain as it
was, I told her it was impo&s;&s;ible; and I
a&s;ked her how &s;he could think I could
bear the thought of lying with my own
brother.</P>
<P>In this directly oppo&s;ite opinion to
one another my mother and I continued
a long time, and it was impo&s;&s;ible to
reconcile our judgments: many di&s;putes
<PB N="101" REF="109">
we had about it, but we could never
either of us yield our own, or bring
over the other.</P>
<P>At la&s;t I re&s;olved on a de&s;perate cour&s;e,
and told my mother my re&s;olution, viz.
that in &s;hort I would tell him of it my|&s;elf.
My mother was frighted to the
la&s;t degree at the very thoughts of it;
but I bid her be ea&s;y, told her I would
do it gradually, and with all the art and
good humour I was mi&s;tre&s;s of, and
time it al&s;o as well as I could, taking
him in good humour too: I told her, I
did not que&s;tion I &s;hould &s;ucceed in my
de&s;ign, and we might part by con&s;ent,
and with a good agreement, for I might
love him well enough for a brother,
though I could not for a hu&s;band; and
this made me &s;ee there was an ab&s;olute
nece&s;&s;ity of breaking the ca&s;e to him
without any delay, which I did the next
evening with all the caution and re&s;erve
imaginable.</P>
<P>As we were &s;itting and talking very
friendly together under a little auning,
which &s;erved as an arbour at the entrance
from our hou&s;e into the garden, I
fetched a deep &s;igh, and &s;aid I was &s;orry
<PB N="102" REF="110">
to acquaint him there was an unhappy
circum&s;tance in our ca&s;e, which lay too
clo&s;e to my heart, and which I knew not
how to break to him.</P>
<P>He importuned me to tell him what it
was. I told him I could not tell how
to do it; that while it was concealed
from him, I alone was unhappy; but if
he knew it al&s;o, we &s;hould be both &s;o,
and that therefore to keep him in igno|rance,
was the kinde&s;t thing I could do,
and it was on that account alone that I
kept a &s;ecret from him, the very keep|ing
of which I thought would fir&s;t or
la&s;t be my de&s;truction.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s his &s;urpri&s;e
at this relation, and the double importu|nity
which he u&s;ed with me to di&s;cover
it. He told me I could not be called
kind to him; nay, I could not be faith|ful,
if I concealed it from him. I told
him I thought &s;o too, and yet I could
not do it.</P>
<P>He then told me he was re&s;olved not
to differ with me in any thing; and that,
therefore, he would importune me no
more about it, re&s;olving to acquie&s;ce in
whatever I did or &s;aid, only begged I
<PB N="103" REF="111">
would then agree, that whatever it was,
it &s;hould not interrupt our quiet and
our mutual kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>I an&s;wered him plainly, that I could
not &s;ay I was glad not to be importuned,
though I could not tell how to comply.
&startq;But come, my dear,&endq; &s;aid I; &startq;what
conditions will you make with me upon
the opening this affair to you.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Any conditions in the world,&endq; &s;aid
he, &startq;that you can in rea&s;on de&s;ire of
me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well,&endq; &s;aid I, &startq;come give it me
under your hand, that if you do not
find I am in any fault, or that I am will|ingly
concerned in the cau&s;es of the
misfortune that is to follow, you will
not blame me, or make me the &s;ufferer
for that which I was intirely ignorant
of.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;is the mo&s;t rea|&s;onable
demand in the world, not to
blame you for that which is not your
fault; give me a pen and ink.&endq;</P>
<P>So I ran in and fetched pen, ink, and
paper; and he wrote the condition down
in the very words I had promi&s;ed, and
&s;igned it with his name.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="112">
&startq;Well,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;what is the next,
my dear?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, the next is, that you will
not blame me for not di&s;covering the &s;e|cret
before I knew it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Very ju&s;t again,&endq; &s;ays he: &startq;with
all my heart.&endq;</P>
<P>So he wrote down that al&s;o and &s;igned
it.</P>
<P>&startq;Well, my dear, I have but one con|dition
more to make; and that is, that
as there is nobody concerned in it but
you and I, you &s;hall not di&s;cover it to
any per&s;on, excepting to your own mo|ther;
and that in all the mea&s;ures you
&s;hall take upon the di&s;covery, as I am
equally concerned in it with you, though
as innocent as your&s;elf, you &s;hall do no|thing
in a pa&s;&s;ion, nothing to my preju|dice,
or to your mother's prejudice,
without my knowledge and con&s;ent.&endq;</P>
<P>This much amazed him, and he wrote
down the words di&s;tinctly, but read
them over and over before he &s;igned
them, he&s;itating at them, &s;everal times,
and repeating them, &startq;my mother's pre|judice!
and your prejudice! What
<PB N="105" REF="113">
my&s;terious thing can this be?&endq; however,
at la&s;t he &s;igned it.</P>
<P>&startq;Well, my dear, I'll a&s;k you no
more under your hand; but as you are
to hear and to bear the mo&s;t unexpected
and &s;urpri&s;ing event that, perhaps, ever
befel any family in the world, I beg you
to promi&s;e me you will receive it with
compo&s;ure and a pre&s;ence of mind &s;ui|table
to a man of &s;en&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I'll do my utmo&s;t,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;up|on
condition you will keep me no longer
in &s;u&s;pence, for you terrify me with all
the&s;e preliminaries.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why then&mdash;It is this&mdash;I am not
your lawful wife&mdash;our children are ille|gitimate&mdash;I
am your own &s;i&s;ter&mdash;Born
of your own mother now alive, and in the
hou&s;e, who is convinced of the truth,
not to be denied or contradicted.&endq;</P>
<P>He turned pale, trembled, and look|ed
wild. I &s;aid, &startq;Remember your
promi&s;e, and receive it with pre&s;ence of
mind; for who could have &s;aid more to
prepare you for it, than I have done?
therefore have patience and compo&s;e
your&s;elf to hear it out, and I will make
it as &s;hort as I can.&endq; With this, I told
<PB N="106" REF="114">
him how my mother came to di&s;cover it
to me, as the reader has been already
acquainted: &startq;and now, my dear, you
will &s;ee rea&s;on for capitulations, and
that I neither have been the cau&s;e of this
matter, nor could be &s;o, and that I
could know nothing of it before.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I am fully &s;atisfied of that,&endq; &s;ays
he, &startq;but it is a dreadful &s;urpri&s;e to me;
however, I know a remedy for it all,
and a remedy that &s;hall put an end to all
your difficulties, without your going to
England.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That would be as &s;trange,&endq; &s;aid I,
&startq;as all the re&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, no, I will make it ea&s;y, there
is nobody in the way, but my&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>He looked a little di&s;ordered when he
&s;aid this, but I did not apprehend any
thing from it at that time, believing as
it u&s;ed to be &s;aid, &startq;that they who do
tho&s;e things never talk of them; or that
they who talk of &s;uch things never do
them.&endq;</P>
<P>From this time I ob&s;erved he became
pen&s;ive and melancholy; and, as I
thought, a little di&s;tempered in his head.
I endeavoured to talk him into temper,
<PB N="107" REF="115">
and to rea&s;on him into a kind of &s;cheme
for our government in the affair, and &s;ome|times
he would be well, and talk with
&s;ome courage about it: but the weight
of it lay too heavy upon his thoughts;
in &s;hort, it went &s;o far that he made two
attempts upon him&s;elf, and in one of
them had actually &s;trangled him&s;elf, had
not our mother come into the room in
the very moment; but with the help of
a negro &s;ervant, &s;he cut him down and
recovered him.</P>
<P>Things were now come to a lamentable
height: it preyed upon his &s;pirits, and it
threw him into a lingering con&s;umption.
In this di&s;tre&s;s I did not know what to
do: as his life was apparently declining,
it had been certainly my bu&s;ine&s;s to have
&s;taid in the country; but my mind was
re&s;tle&s;s and unea&s;y; I hankered after
coming to England, and nothing would
&s;atisfy me without it.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, by an unwearied importuni|ty,
my hu&s;band was at la&s;t prevailed
with, and &s;o my own fate pu&s;hing me
on, the way was made clear for me, and
my mother concurring, I obtained a ve|ry
<PB N="108" REF="116">
good cargo for my coming to En|gland.</P>
<P>When I parted with my brother, for
&s;uch I am now to call him; we agreed
that after I arrived he &s;hould pretend to
have an account that I was dead in Eng|land,
and &s;o might marry again when
he would. He promi&s;ed and engaged
to me to corre&s;pond with me as a &s;i&s;ter,
and to a&s;&s;i&s;t and &s;upport me as long as I
lived; and that if he died before me,
he would leave &s;ufficient to his mother
to take care of me &s;till, in the name of
a &s;i&s;ter, and he was in &s;ome re&s;pect care|ful
of me, when he heard of me; but
it was &s;o oddly managed that I felt the
di&s;appointments very &s;en&s;ible afterwards,
as you &s;hall hear in its time.</P>
<P>I came away for England in the month
of Augu&s;t, after I had been eight years
in that country: and now a new &s;cene of
misfortunes attended me, which, per|haps,
few women have gone through the
like.</P>
<P>We had an indifferent good voyage
till we came ju&s;t upon the coa&s;t of Eng|land,
and where we arrived in two and
thirty days, but were then ruffled with
<PB N="109" REF="117">
two or three &s;torms, one of which drove
us away to the coa&s;t of I$eland, and we
put in at King&s;ale. We remained there
about thirteen days, got &s;ome refre&s;h|ment
on &s;hore, and put to &s;ea again:
though we met with very bad weather,
in which the &s;hip &s;prung her main-ma&s;t;
at laft we got into Milford-Haven in
Wales, where though it was remote
from our port, I re&s;olved to venture no
more upon the water; &s;o getting my
cloaths and money on &s;hore with my
bills of loading, I re&s;olved to come for
London, and leave the &s;hip to get to her
port as &s;he could, which was to Bri&s;tol,
where my brother's corre&s;pondent liv|er.</P>
<P>I got to London in about three weeks,
and &s;hortly after I went to Bath, for as
I was &s;till far from being old, &s;o my
humour, which was always gay, conti|nued
&s;o to an extreme. I expected &s;ome|thing
or other might happen in my way,
that might mend my circum&s;tances, as
had been my ca&s;e before.</P>
<P>The Bath is a place of gallantry, ex|pen&s;ive,
and full of &s;nares. I went thi|ther
indeed in the view of taking any
<PB N="110" REF="118">
thing that might offer; but I mu&s;t do
my&s;elf that ju&s;tice, as to prote&s;t I knew
nothing ami&s;s, I meant nothing but in
an hone&s;t way.</P>
<P>Here I &s;tayed the whole latter &s;ea&s;on,
as it is called there, and contracted &s;ome
unhappy acquaintance, which rather
prompted the follies I fell afterwards
into, than fortified me again&s;t them. I
lived plea&s;antly, kept good company,
that is to &s;ay, fine gay company; but had
the di&s;couragement to find this way of
living &s;unk me exceedingly, and that as
I had no &s;ettled income, &s;o &s;pending up|on
the main &s;tock was but a certain kind
of bleeding to death; and this gave me
many &s;ad reflections in the intervals of
my other thoughts: however, I &s;hook
them off, and &s;till &s;lattered my&s;elf that
&s;omething or other might offer for my
advantage.</P>
<P>But I was in the wrong place for it, I
was not now at Rotherhithe, where, if I
had &s;et my&s;elf tolerably up, &s;ome hone&s;t &s;ea
captain or other might have talked with
me upon the honourable terms of ma|trimony;
but I was at the Bath where
men find a mi&s;tre&s;s &s;ometimes, but very
<PB N="111" REF="119">
rarely look for a wife, and con&s;equent|ly
the particular acquaintances a woman
can expect to make there, mu&s;t have
&s;ome tendency that way.</P>
<P>I &s;pent the &s;ea&s;on very agreeably, for
though I had contracted &s;ome acquaint|ance
with a gentleman, who came to the
Bath for his diver&s;ion, yet I had enter|ed
into no felonious treaty; I had re|&s;i&s;ted
&s;ome ca&s;ual offers of gallantry, but
I was not wicked enough to come into
the crime for the mere vice of it; and I
had no extraordinary offers made me
that tempted me with the main thing
which I wanted.</P>
<P>However, I contracted an acquain|tance
with a woman, in who&s;e hou&s;e I
lodged; who, though &s;he did not keep
an ill hou&s;e, yet had none of the be&s;t
principles in her&s;elf. I had on all oc|ca&s;ions
behaved &s;o well as not to get
the lea&s;t &s;lur upon my reputation on
any account whatever; and all the men
that I had conver&s;ed with, were of &s;o
good reputation that I had not given the
lea&s;t reflection by conver&s;ing with them;
nor did any of them &s;eem to think there
was room for a wicked corre&s;pondence,
<PB N="112" REF="120">
if they had any of them offered it; yet
there was one gentleman, who always
&s;ingled me out for the diver&s;ion of my
company, as he called it, which, as he
was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, was very agreeable
to him; but at that time there was no
more in it.</P>
<P>I had many melancholy hours at the
Bath, after all the company were gone;
and when the &s;pring came on, &s;he had
&s;ome per&s;ons of character that frequent|ly
lodged in her hou&s;e, and in particu|lar
the gentleman who, as I &s;aid, &s;ingled
me out for his companion the winter
before; and he came down again with
another gentleman, and two &s;ervants,
and lodged in the &s;ame hou&s;e. I &s;u|&s;pected
that my landlady had invited
him $hither, letting him know that I
was &s;till with her; but &s;he denied it, and
prote&s;ted to me that &s;he did not.</P>
<P>This gentleman came down and con|tinued
to &s;ingle me out for his peculiar
confident as well as conver&s;ation: his
company was very agreeable to me, as
mine, if I might believe him, was to
him. He &s;oon under&s;tood I was &s;till a
widow; that I had arrived at Bri&s;tol from
<PB N="113" REF="121">
Virginia by the la&s;t &s;hips; and that I
waited at Bath till the next Virginia fleet
&s;hould arrive, by which I expected con|&s;iderable
effects. I al&s;o under&s;tood by
him that he had a wife, but that the lady
was di&s;tempered in her head, and was
under the conduct of her own relations,
which he con&s;ented to, to avoid any re|flections
that might be ca&s;t on him for
mi&s;managing her cure; and in the mean
time he came to the Bath to divert his
thoughts from the di&s;turbance of &s;uch
a melancholy circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>My landlady, who of her own ac|cord
encouraged the corre&s;pondence on
all occa&s;ions, gave me an advantageous
character of him, as of a man of ho|nour
and of virtue, as well as of a great
e&s;tate; and indeed I had a great deal of
rea&s;on to &s;ay &s;o of him too; for though
we lodged both on a floor, and he had
frequently come into my chamber, even
when I was in bed, and I al&s;o into
his when he was in bed, yet he never of|fered
any thing to me farther than a
ki&s;s.</P>
<P>I frequently took notice to my land|lady
of his exceeding mode&s;ty; and &s;he
<PB N="114" REF="122">
as frequently replied, though &s;he had
been acquainted with him for &s;everal
years, that &s;he never knew him other|ways;
and added, &s;he thought I ought
to expect &s;ome gratification from him
for my company, for indeed he did, as
it were, engro&s;s me, and I was &s;eldom
from him. I told her I had not given
him the lea&s;t occa&s;ion to think I wanted
it, or that I would accept of it from
him. She &s;aid &s;he would take that part
upon her; and the fir&s;t time we were to|gether
alone, after &s;he had talked with
him, he began to enquire into my cir|cum&s;tances.
I told him, that though
my cargo of tobacco was damaged, yet
it was not quite lo&s;t; that the merchant
I had been con&s;igned to had &s;o hone&s;t|ly
managed for me, that I had not want|ed;
and that I hoped, with frugal ma|nagement,
I &s;hould make it hold out
till more would come, which I expected
by the next fleet; that in the mean time
I had retrenched my expences, and
whereas, I kept a maid la&s;t &s;ea&s;on, now
I lived without; but I live, &s;aid I, as
well &s;atisfied now as I did then; add|ing,
that his company had been a means
<PB N="115" REF="123">
to make me live much more chearful|ly
than otherwi&s;e I &s;hould have done,
for which I was much obliged to him;
and &s;o I put off all room for any offer
for the pre&s;ent: however, it was not
long before he attacked me again, and
told me he found that I was backward
to tru&s;t him with the &s;ecret of my cir|cum&s;tances,
which he was &s;orry for;
a&s;&s;uring me he enquired into it with no
de&s;ign to &s;atisfy his own curio&s;ity, but
merely to a&s;&s;i&s;t me, if there was any oc|ca&s;ion;
but &s;ince I would not own my|&s;elf
to &s;tand in need of any a&s;&s;i&s;tance,
he had but one thing more to de&s;ire of
me, and that was, that I would pro|mi&s;e
him if, at any time, I was any way
&s;treightened, or like to be &s;o, I would
frankly tell him of it, and that I would
make u&s;e of him with the &s;ame freedom
that he made the offer; adding, I &s;hould
always find I had a true friend, though
perhaps I was afraid to tru&s;t him.</P>
<P>I omitted nothing that was fit to be
&s;aid by one infinitely obliged, to let him
know, that I had a due &s;en&s;e of his
kindne&s;s; and indeed from that time, I
did not appear &s;o much re&s;erved to him
<PB N="116" REF="124">
as I had done before, though &s;till with|in
the bounds of the &s;tricte&s;t virtue on
both &s;ides; but how free &s;oever our con|ver&s;ation
was, I could not arrive to that
&s;ort of freedom which he de&s;ired, name|ly,
to tell him I wanted money, though
I was &s;ecretly very glad of his offer.</P>
<P>Some weeks pa&s;&s;ed after this, when
my landlady, who had often pre&s;&s;ed me
to it, but found that I could not do it,
comes in bluntly to me when we were
together: &startq;O widow, I have bad news
to tell you this morning.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What is it?&endq; &s;aid I; are the Vir|ginia
&s;hips lo&s;t?&endq; for that was my fear.</P>
<P>&startq;No, no,&endq; &s;ays &s;he, but the man
you &s;ent to Bri&s;tol ye&s;terday for money
is come back, and &s;ays, He has brought
none.&endq;</P>
<P>I could by no means like her project;
I thought it looked too much like
prompting him, which indeed he did not
want, and I &s;aw clearly that I &s;hould
lo&s;e nothing by being backward to a&s;k,
&s;o I took her up &s;hort: &startq;I cannot ima|gine
why he &s;hould &s;ay &s;o to you, for
I a&s;&s;ure you he brought me all the mo|ney
I &s;ent him for, and here it is,&endq; pull|ing
<PB N="117" REF="125">
out my pur&s;e with about twelve gui|neas
in it.</P>
<P>The next morning he and I talked of
it again, when I found he was fully &s;a|tisfied,
and, &s;miling, &s;aid, he hoped I
would not want money and not tell him
of it, and that I had promi&s;ed him other|wi&s;e.
I told him I had been very much
di&s;&s;atisfied at my landlady's talking the
day before of what &s;he had nothing to
do with; but I &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he wanted what
I owed her, which was about eight gui|neas,
which I had re&s;olved to give her,
and had accordingly given it her the
&s;ame night.</P>
<P>He was in a mighty good humour,
when he heard me &s;ay, I had paid her,
and it went off to &s;ome other di&s;cour&s;e;
but the next morning he having heard
me about my room, he called to me.
I an&s;wering, he a&s;ked me to come into
his chamber, for he had &s;omething to
&s;ay to me which was of moment; after
&s;ome very kind expre&s;&s;ions, he a&s;ked me
to let him &s;ee my pur&s;e. I immediately
put my hand into my pocket, and laugh|ing
at him, pulled it out, and there was
in it three guineas and a half: he im|mediately
<PB N="118" REF="126">
went to his e&s;critore, and re|turned
it to me again, filled with gold.</P>
<P>At the end of the &s;ea&s;on he talked of
returning to London, and a&s;ked me if I
would accompany him thither. I repli|ed,
what would the world think of it?
that it would be neither to his credit or
mine; &s;o that I neither a&s;&s;ented, or di&s;|&s;ented.
While this was in agitation,
and before he was to leave Bath, he &s;aid,
he had a little bu&s;ine&s;s to do for a few
days, at a place called Shepton in So|mer&s;et&s;hire.
Accordingly he went, and
was there taken very ill; upon which he
&s;ent his man back to Bath to beg me that
I would hire a po&s;t-chai&s;e and come over
to him. Before he went, he had left
&s;ome money, and other things of value
with me, and what to do with them I
did not know, but I &s;ecured them as
well as I could, locked up the lodgings,
and went to him, where I found him ve|ry
ill indeed; however, I per&s;uaded him
to be carried back in a litter, where there
was more help and better advice to be
had.</P>
<P>He con&s;ented, and I brought him to
the Bath: here he continued very ill of
<PB N="119" REF="127">
a fever, and kept his bed five weeks,
all which time I nur&s;ed him and tended
him my&s;elf, as much, and as carefully,
as if I had been his wife; indeed if I
had been his wife I could not have done
more: I &s;at up with him &s;o often, that
at la&s;t he would let me &s;it up no longer,
and then I got a pallet-bed into his
room, and lay in it ju&s;t at his bed's
feet.</P>
<P>I was indeed &s;en&s;ibly affected with his
condition, and with the apprehen&s;ion
of lo&s;ing &s;uch a friend as he was, and
was like to be to me, and I u&s;ed to &s;it
and cry by him many hours together:
however, at la&s;t he grew better, and
gave hopes that he would recover, as in|deed
he did, though very &s;lowly.</P>
<P>Were it otherwi&s;e than what I am go|ing
to &s;ay, I &s;hould not be backward to
di&s;clo&s;e it, as it is apparent I have done
in other ca&s;es in this account; but I af|firm,
that through all his conver&s;ation,
abating the freedom of coming into the
chamber when I or he was in bed, and
abating the nece&s;&s;ary offices of attending
him night and day, when he was &s;ick,
<PB N="120" REF="128">
there had not pa&s;&s;ed the lea&s;t immode&s;t
word or action between us.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time he gathered &s;trength,
and grew well apace, and I would have
removed my bed, but he would not let
me, till he was able to venture him&s;elf
without any body to &s;it up with him,
and then I removed to my own cham|ber.</P>
<P>He took many occa&s;ions to expre&s;s
his &s;en&s;e of my tenderne&s;s and concern
for him; and when he grew quite well,
he made me a pre&s;ent of fifty guineas for
my care, and, as he called it, for ha|zarding
my life to &s;ave his.</P>
<P>He ob&s;erving me &s;urpri&s;ed, told me
as he had a &s;incere re&s;pect for me, and
knew my circum&s;tances, that he thought
I had merited it from him, by giving
him my company &s;o intirely as I had
done.</P>
<P>And now he made deep prote&s;tations
of a &s;incere inviolable affection for me,
but all along atte&s;ted it to be with the
utmo&s;t re&s;erve for my virtue, and his
own. I told him I was fully &s;atisfied of
it. He carried it that length that he pro|te&s;ted,
that if he was naked in bed with
<PB N="121" REF="129">
me, he would as &s;acredly pre&s;erve my
virtue, as he would defend it if I was
a&s;&s;aulted by a ravi&s;her. I believed him,
and told him I did &s;o: but this did not
&s;atisfy him, he would wait for an op|portunity
to give me an undoubted te&s;|timony
of it.</P>
<P>It was &s;ome time after this that I had
occa&s;ion to go to Bri&s;tol; upon which
he hired me a po&s;t-chai&s;e, and would
go with me; and now indeed our inti|macy
increa&s;ed. From Bri&s;tol he carri|ed
me to Glouce&s;ter, which was meerly
a journey of plea&s;ure to take the air;
and here we could have no lodging in
the inn but in one large chamber with
two beds in it.</P>
<P>The ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e going up
with us to &s;hew us his room, &s;aid, very
freely, &startq;Sir, it is none of my bu&s;ine&s;s
to inquire whether the lady be your
&s;pou&s;e or no; but if not, you may lie as
hone&s;tly in tho&s;e two beds as if you were
in two chambers.&endq;</P>
<P>With that he pulls a great curtain
which drew quite cro&s;s the room, and
effectually divided the beds. &startq;Well,&endq;
<PB N="122" REF="130">
&s;ays my friend, &startq;the&s;e beds will do; and
as for the re&s;t, we are too near a kin to
lay together, though we may lodge near
one another.&endq;</P>
<P>When bed-time came, he decently
went out of the room until I was in bed,
and then went in the bed on his own &s;ide
of the room, but lay talking to me for
&s;ome time.</P>
<P>At la&s;t repeating his u&s;ual &s;aying, that
he could lie in the bed with me, and not
offer me the lea&s;t injury, he &s;tarts up,
&startq;And now, my dear,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;you
&s;hall &s;ee how ju&s;t I will be to you, and
that I can keep my word;&endq; and away he
comes to my bed.</P>
<P>I re&s;i&s;ted a little, but I mu&s;t confe&s;s I
&s;hould not have re&s;i&s;ted him much, if he
had not made tho&s;e promi&s;es; &s;o after a
little &s;truggle, I $ay &s;till, and let him
come into my bed. When he was there
he took me in his arms, but he did not of|fer
any thing, other than embracing me,
no not the whole night, but ro&s;e up and
dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the morning, and left
me as innocent for him, as I was the
day I was born.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="131">
This was a &s;urpri&s;ing thing to me,
and perhaps may be &s;o to others, for he
was a bri&s;k per&s;on; nor did he act thus
on a principle of religion, but of mere
affection; in&s;i&s;ting on it, that though I
was to him the mo&s;t agreeable woman
in the world, yet becau&s;e he loved me
he could not injure me.</P>
<P>I own it was a noble principle, but
as it was what I never under&s;tood before,
it was to me the more amazing. We
travelled the re&s;t of the journey as we
did before, and came back to the Bath,
where, as he had opportunity to come
to me when he would, he often repeated
the moderation, and, although all the
familiarities, between man and wife,
were common to us, yet he never once
offered to go any farther; and he valued
him&s;elf much upon it: yet, I do not
&s;ay that I was &s;o plea&s;ed with it as he
thought I was.</P>
<P>We lived thus near two years, only
with this exception, that he went three
times to London, and once he continu|ed
there four months; but, to do him
ju&s;tice, he always &s;upplied me with mo|ney
very hand&s;omely.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="132">
Had we continued thus, we had had
much to boa&s;t of; but as wi&s;e men &s;ay,
&startq;It is ill venturing too near the brink
of a command,&endq; &s;o we found it; and
here again I mu&s;t do him the ju&s;tice
his own, that the fir&s;t breach was not on
his part. It was one night, having drank,
I think, a little more wine, both of us,
than u&s;ual, though not in the lea&s;t to
di&s;order either of us, when being cla&s;p|ed
clo&s;e in his arms, I told him, I re|peat
it with &s;hame, that I could find in
my heart to di&s;charge him of his engage|ments
for one night.</P>
<P>He took me at my word immediately,
and after that, there was no re&s;i&s;ting him,
neither indeed had I any mind to re&s;i&s;t
him.</P>
<P>Thus the government of our virtue
was broken, and I exchanged the place
of friend, for that unmu&s;ical har&s;h-&s;ounding
title of a mi&s;tre&s;s. The way
being thus cleared, and the bars of vir|tue
and con&s;cience thus removed, we
had the le&s;s difficulty afterwards to &s;trug|gle
with.</P>
<P>Frequently I looked on him with
blu&s;hes; and every now and then &s;tarted
<PB N="125" REF="133">
that melancholy objection, &startq;If I &s;hould
be with child, what will become of me?&endq;
He encouraged me by telling me, &s;ince it
was gone &s;uch a length, if I was with
child, he would take care of that, and
of me too: this hardened us both. At
length, as I had feared, &s;o it came to
pa&s;s, and I was indeed with child.</P>
<P>After I was &s;ure it was &s;o, we began
to think of taking mea&s;ures for the ma|naging
it, and I propo&s;ed tru&s;ting the
&s;ecret to my landlady, which he agreed
to. My landlady made light of it; &s;he
&s;aid &s;he knew it would come to that at
la&s;t, and made us merry about it: we
found her an experienced old lady at
&s;uch work; &s;he undertook every thing,
engaged to procure a midwife and a
nur&s;e, to &s;atisfy all inquiries, and bring
us off with reputation.</P>
<P>When I grew near my time, as he had
furni&s;hed me very &s;ufficiently with mo|ney
for the extraordinary expences of
my lying-in, he left me and went to
London. I had every thing very hand|&s;ome
about me, but did not affect to
be extravagant; be&s;ides, knowing that
&s;uch kind of affairs do not often la&s;t
<PB N="126" REF="134">
long, I took care to lay up as much
money as I could; making him believe
it was all &s;pent upon the extraordinary
appearance of things in my lying-in.</P>
<P>I was brought to bed of a fine boy,
and when he heard of it he wrote me a
very kind letter about it, and he thought
it would look better for me to come away
for London as &s;oon as I was up and well;
that he had provided apartments for me
at Hammer&s;mith, as if I came thither
only from London; and that after a little
while I &s;hould go back to the Bath, and
he would go with me.</P>
<P>I embraced this offer, and according|ly
hired a coach, and taking my child,
a wet-nur&s;e, and a maid &s;ervant with me,
I went for London.</P>
<P>He met me at Reading in his own
chariot, and taking me into it, I left
the &s;ervants and the child in the hired
coach, and we all came to the londgings
at Hammer&s;mith.</P>
<P>Now I was indeed in the height of
what I might call my pro&s;perity, and
I wanted nothing but to be a wife, which,
however, could not be in this ca&s;e, there
was no room for it; and, therefore, on
<PB N="127" REF="135">
all occa&s;ions I &s;tudied to &s;ave what I
could; knowing well enough, that men
who keep mi&s;tre&s;&s;es often change, grow
weary, and jealous of them, or &s;ome|thing
or other happens to make them
withdraw their bounty; and &s;ometimes
the ladies that are thus well u&s;ed, are
not careful by a prudent conduct to
pre&s;erve the e&s;teem of their per&s;ons,
or the nice article of their fidelity, and
then they are ju&s;tly ca&s;t off with con|tempt.</P>
<P>But I was &s;ecured in this point: for
as I had no inclination to change, &s;o I
had no manner of acquaintance, and no
temptation to look any farther. I kept
no company but in the family where I
lodged, and with a clergyman's lady at the
next door; &s;o that when he was ab&s;ent
I vi&s;ited nobody, nor did he ever find
me out of my chamber or parlour when|ever
he came down; if I went any where
to take the air it was always with him.</P>
<P>The living in this manner with him,
and he with me, was certainly the mo&s;t
unde&s;igned thing in the world; he pro|te&s;ted,
that when he became fir&s;t ac|quainted
with me, and even to the very
<PB N="128" REF="136">
night when we fir&s;t broke in upon our
rules, he never had the lea&s;t de&s;ign; that
he always had a fincere affection for me,
but not the lea&s;t real inclimation to do
what he had done. I a&s;&s;ured him I ne|ver
&s;u&s;pected him; that if I had, I
&s;hould not &s;o ea&s;ily have yielded to the
freedoms which brought it on, but that
it was all a &s;urpri&s;e, and was owing to
the accident of our having yielded too
far to our mutual inclinations that night;
and indeed I have often ob&s;erved &s;ince,
and leave it as a memento to the readers
of this &s;tory, that we ought to be cau|tious
of gratifying our inclinations in
loo&s;e freedoms, le&s;t we find our re&s;olu|tions
of virtue fail us, when their a&s;&s;i&s;|tance
&s;hould be mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>It is true, from the fir&s;t hour I be|gan
to conver&s;e with him, I re&s;olved to
oblige him if he offered it; but it was
becau&s;e I wanted his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and I
knew no other way of &s;ecuring him;
but when we were that night together,
and had gone &s;uch a length, I found my
weakne&s;s; the inclination was not to be
re&s;i&s;ted, and was obliged to yield up all
even before he a&s;ked it.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="137">
However, he was &s;o ju&s;t that he ne|ver
upbraided me with it; nor did he
ever expre&s;s the lea&s;t di&s;like of my con|duct
on any other occa&s;ion, but always
prote&s;ted he was as much delighted with
my company as he was the fir&s;t hour we
came together.</P>
<P>It is true, he had no wife, that is,
&s;he was no wife to him, and &s;o I was in
no danger that way; but the ju&s;t reflec|tions
of con&s;cience oftentimes &s;natch a
man, e&s;pecially a man of &s;en&s;e, from
the arms of a mi&s;tre&s;s, as it did him at
la&s;t, though on another occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>On the other hand, though I was not
without &s;ecret reproaches of my own
con&s;cience for the life I led, and that
even in the greate&s;t height of the &s;ati&s;|faction
I ever took, yet I had the terri|ble
pro&s;pect of poverty which lay on me
as a frightful &s;pectre, &s;o that there was
no looking behind me: but as poverty
brought me into it, &s;o fear of poverty
kept me in it, and I frequently re&s;olved
to leave it quite off, if I could but come
to lay up enough to maintain me: but
the&s;e were thoughts of no weight, and
whenever he came to me they vani&s;h|ed;
<PB N="130" REF="138">
for his company was &s;o delightful,
that there was no being melancholy
when he was there, the reflections were
all the &s;ubject of tho&s;e hours when I was
alone.</P>
<P>I lived &s;ix years in this happy, or ra|ther
unhappy condition, in which time I
brought him three children; and though
I removed twice, yet I came back the
&s;ixth year to my fir&s;t lodgings at Ham|mer&s;mith:
it was here that I was one
morning &s;urpri&s;ed with a kind, but me|lancholy
letter from him, intimating,
that he was ill, and was afraid he &s;hould
have another fit of &s;ickne&s;s, but his
wife's relations being in the hou&s;e, it
would not be practicable to have me
with him, which, however, he expre&s;&s;|ed
his great di&s;&s;atisfaction in, and that
he wi&s;hed I could be allowed to nur&s;e
him as I did before.</P>
<P>I was very much concerned at this ac|count,
and was very impatient to know
how it was with him. I waited a fort|night,
and heard nothing: which &s;urpri&s;|ed
me, and I began to be very unea&s;y; I
think I may &s;ay, that for the next fortnight
I was near to di&s;traction: it was my par|ticular
<PB N="131" REF="139">
difficulty, that I did not know di|rectly
where he was; for I under&s;tood at
fir&s;t he was in the lodgings of his wife's
mother: but having removed my&s;elf to
London, I &s;oon found by the help of
the direction I had for writing my letters
to him, how to enquire after him, and
there I found that he was at a hou&s;e in
Bloom&s;bury-&s;quare, whither he had, a
little before he fell &s;ick, removed his
whole family; and that his wife and his
wife's mother were in the &s;ame hou&s;e,
though the wife was not &s;uffered to know
that &s;he was in the &s;ame hou&s;e with her
hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Here I al&s;o under&s;tood that he was at
the la&s;t extremity, which made me almo&s;t
at the la&s;t extremity too, to have a true
account. One night I had the curio&s;ity
to di&s;gui&s;e my&s;elf like a &s;ervant maid,
and went to the door, as &s;ent by a lady of
the neighbourhood, where he had lived be|fore,
and giving my ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s's
compliments, I &s;aid, &startq;I was &s;ent to
know how Mr. Bates did, and how he
had re&s;ted that night.&endq;</P>
<P>In delivering this me&s;&s;age, I got the
opportunity I de&s;ired: for &s;peaking with
<PB N="132" REF="140">
one of the maids, I held a long go&s;&s;ip's
tale with her, and had all the particu|lars
of his illne&s;s, which I found was a
pleuri&s;y attended with a cough and a
fever. She told me al&s;o who was in the
hou&s;e, and how his wife was, who, by
her relation, they were in &s;ome hopes
might recover her under&s;tanding; but
as to the gentleman him&s;elf, &s;he told me
the doctors &s;aid, there were very little
hopes of him; in the morning they
thought he had been dying, and he was
but little better then, for they did not
expect that he could live over the night.</P>
<P>This was heavy news for me: and I
began now to &s;ee an end of my pro&s;pe|rity,
and to &s;ee al&s;o that it was very
well I had &s;aved &s;omething, for that
now I had no view of my own living
before me.</P>
<P>It lay very heavy upon my mind too,
that I had a &s;on, about five years old,
and no provi&s;ion made for him, at lea&s;t
that I knew off. With the&s;e con&s;idera|tions,
and a &s;ad heart, I went home,
and began to think how I &s;hould live,
and in what manner to be&s;tow my&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="141">
I could not re&s;t without enquiring
again how he was; and not venturing to
go my&s;elf, I &s;ent &s;everal me&s;&s;engers,
until after a fortnight's waiting longer,
I found there were hopes of his life,
though he was &s;till very ill: then I a|bated
my &s;ending any more, and &s;ome
time after I learnt in the neighbourhood
that he was abroad again.</P>
<P>I then made no doubt, but I &s;hould
&s;oon hear of him, and began to comfort
my&s;elf, being, as I thought, recovered.
With much &s;urpri&s;e and amazement, I
waited near two months and heard no|thing,
but that being recovered he was
gone into the country for the air; after
this it was yet two months more, and
then I under&s;tood he was returned to
London again, but &s;till I heard nothing
from him.</P>
<P>I had &s;ent &s;everal letters to him, and
directed them as u&s;ual, and found two
or three of them had been called for,
but not the re&s;t. I wrote again in a
more pre&s;&s;ing manner, and in one of
them, let him know, that I mu&s;t be
forced to wait on him my&s;elf, repre|&s;enting
my circum&s;tances, the rent of
<PB N="134" REF="142">
lodgings to pay, and the provi&s;ion for
the child wanting, and my own deplo|rable
condition, de&s;titute of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence
after his &s;olemn engagement to take care
of, and provide for me. I took a copy
of this letter, and finding it lay at the
hou&s;e, near a month, and was not called
for, I found means to have the copy of
it put into his own hands at a Coffee-hou&s;e,
where I had by enquiry found he
u&s;ed to go.</P>
<P>This letter forced an an&s;wer from him;
by which, though I found I was to be
abandoned, yet I found he had &s;ent a
letter to me &s;ome time before, de&s;iring
me to go down to the Bath again; its
contents I &s;hall come to pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>It is true, that &s;ick beds are the times
when &s;uch corre&s;pondences as this are
looked on with different countenance,
and &s;een with other eyes than we &s;aw
them with, or than they appeared with
before. My lover had been at the gates
of death, and at the very brink of eter|nity;
and it &s;eems had been &s;truck with
remor&s;e, and with &s;ad reflections upon
his pa&s;t life; and among the re&s;t, this
criminal corre&s;pondence with me, which
<PB N="135" REF="143">
was neither more or le&s;s than a long-continued
life of adultery, had repre&s;ent|ed
it&s;elf, as it really was, not as it had
been formerly thought by him to be; and
he looked upon it now with a ju&s;t and a
religious abhorrence.</P>
<P>I cannot but ob&s;erve al&s;o, and leave
it for the direction of my &s;ex in &s;uch
ca&s;es, that whenever &s;incere repentance
&s;ucceeds &s;uch a crime as this, there
never fails to attend a hatred of the ob|ject;
and the more the affection might
&s;eem to be before, the hatred will be the
more in proportion. It will always be
&s;o, it can be no otherwi&s;e; for there
cannot be a true and &s;incere abhorrence
of the offence, and the love to the cau&s;e
of it remain; there will with an abhor|rence
of the &s;in, be found a dete&s;tation
of the fellow-&s;inner; you can expect no
other.</P>
<P>I found it &s;o here: though good-man|ners,
and ju&s;tice, kept him from carry|ing
it on to an extream; but the &s;hort
hi&s;tory of his part in this affair, was
thus; he perceived by my la&s;t letter,
and by all the re&s;t, which he went for
after, that I was not gone to the Bath,
<PB N="136" REF="144">
that his fir&s;t letter had not come to my
hand, upon which he wrote me the fol|lowing.</P>
<P>&startq;Madam,&endq; &startq;I
am &s;urpi&s;ed that my letter dated
the eighth of la&s;t month did not come
to your hand. I give you my word it
was delivered at your lodgings, and to
the hands of your maid.</P>
<P>I need not acquaint you with what has
been my condition for &s;ome time pa&s;t;
and having been at the edge of the
grave, I am, by the unexpected and un|de&s;erved
mercy of Heaven, re&s;tored
again. In the condition I have been in,
it cannot be &s;trange to you, that our
unhappy corre&s;pondence has not been
the lea&s;t of the burthens which lay upon
my mind: I need &s;ay no more, tho&s;e
things that mu&s;t be repented of, mu&s;t be
al&s;o reformed.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h you would think of going back
to the Bath. I enclo&s;e you here a bill for
one hundred pounds for clearing your|&s;elf
at your lodgings, and carrying you
down, and hope it will be no &s;urpri&s;e to
you to add, that on this account only,
<PB N="137" REF="145">
and not for any offence given me on
your &s;ide, I can &s;ee you no more. I will
take care of the child; leave him where
he is, or take him with you, as you
plea&s;e. I wi&s;h you the like reflections,
and that they may be to your advantage.
I am, &amp;c.&endq;</P>
<P>I was &s;truck with this letter, &s;uch as
I cannot de&s;cribe. The reproaches of my
own con&s;cience were &s;uch as I cannot
expre&s;s, for I was not blind to my
own crime: Yet, I never once reflected
that I was all this while a married wo|man,
a wife to Mr. Smith the linnen-draper,
who though he had left me by
the nece&s;&s;ity of his circum&s;tances, had
no power to di&s;charge me from the mar|riage-contract
which was between us, or
to give the a legal liberty to marry
again; &s;o that I had been no le&s;s than
an adultre&s;s all this while. I then re|proached
my&s;elf with the liberties I had
taken, and how I had been a &s;nare to
him, and that indeed, I was principal
in the crime: that now he was merci|fully
&s;natched out of the gulph by a
convincing work upon his mind, but
<PB N="138" REF="146">
that I was left as if I was for&s;aken of
God's grace, and abandoned by Heaven
to a continuing in my wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e reflections I continued
very pen&s;ive for near a month, and did
not go down to the Bath, having no in|clination
to be with the woman who I
was with before; and be&s;ides, I was
very loth &s;he &s;hould know I was de|&s;erted.</P>
<P>And now I was greatly perplexed a|bout
my little boy. It was death to me
to part with the child, and yet when
I con&s;idered the danger of being one
time or other left with him to keep with|out
a maintenance to &s;upport him, I then
re&s;olved to leave him where he was; but
then I concluded al&s;o to be near him
my&s;elf too, that I might have the &s;atis|faction
of &s;eeing him, without the care
of providing for him.</P>
<P>I &s;ent Mr. Bates a letter therefore,
that I had obeyed his orders in all things,
but that of going back to the Bath,
which I could not think of for many
rea&s;ons. That, however, parting from
him was a wound to me that I could ne|ver
recover; yet I was fully &s;atisfied his
<PB N="139" REF="147">
reflections were ju&s;t, and would be very
far from de&s;iring to ob&s;truct his refor|mation
or repentance.</P>
<P>Then I repre&s;ented my own circum|&s;tances
to him in the mo&s;t moving
terms. I told him that tho&s;e unhappy
di&s;tre&s;&s;es which fir&s;t moved him to a
generous and an hone&s;t friend&s;hip for
me, would, I hope, move him to a lit|tle
concern for me now; though the
criminal part of our corre&s;pondence,
which I believed neither of us intended
to fall into at that time, was broken off;
that I de&s;ired to repent as &s;incerely as
he had done, but entreated him to put
me in &s;ome condition, that I might not
be expo&s;ed to temptations from the
frightful pro&s;pect of poverty and di&s;|tre&s;s;
and if he had the lea&s;t apprehen|&s;ions
of my being trouble&s;ome to him,
I begged he would put me in a condi|tion
to go back to my mother in Virgi|nia,
from whence he knew I came, and
that would put an end to all his fears on
that account. I concluded, that if he
would &s;end me fifty pounds more to
facilitate my going away, I would pro|mi&s;e
never to di&s;turb him again; unle&s;s
<PB N="140" REF="148">
it was to hear of the well-doing of the
child, who, if I found my mother living,
and my circum&s;tances able, I would
&s;end for to come over to me, and take
him al&s;o effectually off of his hands.
Accordingly he was &s;o genteel as to &s;end
me the money; thus, though full &s;ore
again&s;t my will, a final end was put to
this amour.</P>
<P>And here I cannot but reflect upon
the unhappy con&s;equence of too great
freedoms between per&s;ons &s;tated as we
were, upon the pretence of innocent in|tentions,
and the love of friend&s;hip;
for the fle&s;h has generally &s;o great a
&s;hare in tho&s;e friend&s;hips that it is great
odds but inclination prevails at la&s;t over
the mo&s;t &s;olemn re&s;olutions, and that
vice breaks in at the breaches of decen|cy,
which really innocent friend&s;hip
ought to pre&s;erve with the greate&s;t &s;trict|ne&s;s:
but I leave the readers of the&s;e
things to their own ju&s;t reflections,
which they will be more able to make
effectual, than I, who &s;o &s;oon forgot
my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I now had no help, no a&s;&s;i&s;tance, no
guide for my conduct. I knew what I
<PB N="141" REF="149">
aimed at, and what I wanted; but knew
not how to pur&s;ue the end by direct
means. I wanted to be placed in a &s;et|tled
&s;tate of living, and had I happened
to have met with a &s;ober good hu&s;band,
I &s;hould have been as faithful a wife to
him as virtue it&s;elf could have formed.
If I have been otherwi&s;e, the vice came
in always at the door of nece&s;&s;ity, not
at the door of inclination; and I under|&s;tood
too well, by the want of it, what
the value of a &s;ettled life was, to do
any thing to forfeit the felicity of it;
nay, I &s;hould have made the better wife
for all the difficulties I had pa&s;&s;ed thro',
nor did I in any of the times that I
had been a wife, give my hu&s;bands the
lea&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s on account of my be|haviour.</P>
<P>At length, a new &s;cene opened. There
was in the hou&s;e, where I lodged, a
North-country gentlewoman, and nothing
was more frequent in her di&s;cour&s;e, than
her account of the cheapne&s;s of provi|&s;ions,
and the ea&s;y way of living in her
country; how plentiful every thing was,
and what good company they kept; 'till
<PB N="142" REF="150">
at la&s;t I told her &s;he almo&s;t tempted me
to go and live in her country; for I
that was a widow, though I had &s;uffi|cient
to live on, yet had no way of en|crea&s;ing
it, and that London was an ex|pen&s;ive
and extravagant place.</P>
<P>I &s;hould here ob&s;erve, that not only
&s;he, but others, imagined I was a great
fortune, or at lea&s;t, that I had three or
four thou&s;and pounds, if not more, and
all in my own hands: this woman, I
&s;ay, was mighty free with me, when &s;he
thought me inclined to go into her
country; &s;he &s;aid, &s;he had a &s;i&s;ter lived
near Leverpoole, that her brother was a
con&s;iderable gentleman there, and had a
great e&s;tate al&s;o in Ireland; that &s;he
would go down there in about two
months, and if I would give her my
company thither, I &s;hould be as wel|come
as her&s;elf for a month, or more,
as I plea&s;ed, 'till I &s;hould &s;ee how I liked
the country; and if I thought fit to
live there, &s;he would undertake they
would take care, though they did not
entertain lodgers them&s;elves, they would
recommend me to &s;ome agreeable family
<PB N="143" REF="151">
where I &s;hould be placed to my con|tent.</P>
<P>If this woman had known my real
circum&s;tances, &s;he would never have
laid &s;o many &s;nares, and taken &s;o many
weary &s;teps to catch a de&s;olate creature
that was good for little when it was
caught: and indeed, I, who&s;e ca&s;e was
almo&s;t de&s;perate, and thought I could
not be much wor&s;e, was not very anxious
about what might befall me, provided
they did me no per&s;onal injury; &s;o I
&s;uffered my&s;elf, though not without a
deal of invitation, and great profe&s;&s;ions
of &s;incere friend&s;hip and real kindne&s;s,
to be prevailed upon to go with her;
and accordingly I packed up my things,
and put my&s;elf in a readine&s;s, though I
did not ab&s;olutely know whither I was
to go.</P>
<P>And now I found my&s;elf in great di&s;|tre&s;s;
for I had not one friend in the
world with whom to tru&s;t that little I
had, or to direct me how to di&s;po&s;e of
it, and this perplexed me. I thought
of the Bank, but I had no friend to
commit the management of it to, and
to keep and carry about with me bank
<PB N="144" REF="152">
bills, I looked upon it as un&s;afe; that if
they were lo&s;t, my money was lo&s;t, and
then I was undone; and on the other
hand I might be robbed and perhaps
murdered in a &s;trange place for them;
this perplexed me &s;trangely, and what to
do I knew not.</P>
<P>It came in my thoughts one morn|ing
that I would go to the Bank my&s;elf,
where I had often been to receive the in|tere&s;t
of &s;ome bills I had, which had in|tere&s;t
payable on them, and where I
had found the clerk to whom I applied
my&s;elf very hone&s;t, and particularly &s;o
fair one time, that when I had mi&s;s-told
my money, and taken le&s;s than my due,
and was coming away, he &s;et me to
rights and gave me the re&s;t.</P>
<P>I went to him, and repre&s;ented my
ca&s;e, and a&s;ked, if he would trouble
him&s;elf to be my advi&s;er, who was a
friendle&s;s widow, and knew not what to
do. He told me, if I de&s;ired his opi|nion
of any thing within the reach of
his bu&s;ine&s;s, he would do his endeavour
that I &s;hould not be wronged; that he
would help me to a &s;ober per&s;on, a man
of his acquaintance, who was a clerk in
<PB N="145" REF="153">
&s;uch bu&s;ine&s;s too, though not in their
hou&s;e, who&s;e judgment was good, and
who&s;e hone&s;ty I might depend upon,
&startq;for,&endq; added he, &startq;I will an&s;wer for
him, and for every &s;tep he takes.&endq;</P>
<P>After &s;ome pau&s;e, I told him, I had
rather have depended upon him&s;elf, be|cau&s;e
I had found him hone&s;t, but if
that could not be, I would take his re|commendation
&s;ooner than any one's el&s;e;
&startq;I dare &s;ay, madam, that you will be as
well &s;atis&s;ied with my friend as with me,
and he is thoroughly able to a&s;&s;i&s;t you,
which I am not;&endq; he added, that his
friend &s;hould take nothing of me for
his advice or a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and this encou|raged
me much.</P>
<P>He appointed the &s;ame evening for
me to meet him and his friend; and in|deed
as &s;oon as I &s;aw him, and he began
to talk of the affair, I was fully &s;atis|fied
that I had a very hone&s;t man to deal
with: his countenance &s;poke it; and his
character, as I heard afterwards, was
every where &s;o good, that I had no room
for any doubts upon me.</P>
<P>He told me I might lodge the money
in the bank as an account, and its being
<PB N="146" REF="154">
entered in the books would entitle me to
the money at any time: and if I was in
the North I might draw bills on the
ca&s;hire and receive it when I would;
but that then it would be e&s;teemed as
running ca&s;h, and the bank would give
no intere&s;t for it; that I might buy
&s;tock with it, and &s;o it would lie in &s;tore
for me; but that then if I wanted to
di&s;po&s;e of it, I mu&s;t come up to town
to transfer it, and even it would be with
&s;ome difficulty I &s;hould receive the half-yearly
dividend, unle&s;s I was here in
per&s;on, or had &s;ome friend I could tru&s;t
with having the &s;tock in his name to
do it for me, and that would have the
&s;ame difficulty in it as before; and with
that he looked hard at me and &s;miled;
at la&s;t, &s;ays he, &startq;Why do you not get
a &s;teward, madam, that may take you
and your money together, and then you
will have the trouble taken off of your
hands?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ay, &s;ir, and the money too it may
be, for truly I find the hazard that way
is as much as it is the other way;&endq; but
I remember, I &s;aid, &s;ecretly to my&s;elf,
&startq;I wi&s;h you will a&s;k me the que&s;tion, I
<PB N="147" REF="155">
would con&s;ider very &s;eriou&s;ly on it be|fore
I &s;aid no.&endq;</P>
<P>He went on a good way with me, and
I thought once or twice he was in earn|e&s;t,
but I found at la&s;t he had a wife;
but when he owned he had, he &s;hook
his head, and &s;aid, with &s;ome concern,
that indeed, he had a wife, and no
wife. I began to think he had been in
the condition of my late lover. How|ever,
we had not much more di&s;cour&s;e
at that time, but he told me he was
in too much hurry of bu&s;ine&s;s then;
that if I would come to his hou&s;e after
their bu&s;ine&s;s was over, he would con|&s;ider
what might be done for me. I
told him I would come, and de&s;ired to
know where he lived. He gave me a
direction in writing; and when he gave
it me, he &s;aid, &startq;there it is, madam, if
you dare tru&s;t your&s;elf with me,&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, &s;ir, I believe I may venture
to tru&s;t you, for you have a wife you
&s;ay, and I don't want a hu&s;band; be|&s;ides,
I dare tru&s;t you with my money,
and if that were gone, I may tru&s;t my|&s;elf
any where.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="156">
He &s;aid &s;ome things in je&s;t that were
very hand&s;ome, and would have plea&s;ed
me very well if they had been in earn|e&s;t;
but that pa&s;&s;ed over. I took the
directions, and appointed to attend him
at his hou&s;e at &s;even a clock the &s;ame
evening.</P>
<P>When I came he made &s;everal propo|&s;als
for my placing my money in the
Bank, in order to my having intere&s;t for
it; but &s;till &s;ome difficulty or other
came in the way, which he objected as
not &s;afe; and I found &s;uch a &s;incere
di&s;intere&s;ted hone&s;ty in him, I began to
think, I had certainly found the hone&s;t
man I wanted, and that I could never
put my&s;elf into better hands; &s;o I told
him, with a great deal of freedom, that
I had never met with man or woman
yet that I could tru&s;t, or in whom I
could think my&s;elf &s;afe; but I &s;aw he
was &s;o di&s;intere&s;tedly concerned for my
welfare, that I &s;aid I would freely tru&s;t
him with the management of that little
I had, if he would accept to be &s;teward
for a widow that could give him no
&s;alary.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="157">
He &s;miled, and getting up, with great
re&s;pect, &s;aluted me. He &s;aid he took it
very kindly I had &s;o good an opinion of
him; that he would not deceive me,
and he would do any thing in his power
to &s;erve me; but he could not by any
means accept of a tru&s;t that might
bring him to be &s;u&s;pected of &s;elf-in|tere&s;t,
and if I &s;hould die he might have
di&s;putes with my executors, which he
&s;hould be very loth to encumber him&s;elf
with.</P>
<P>I replied, if tho&s;e were all his objec|tions
I would &s;oon remove them, and
convince him, there was not the lea&s;t
room for any difficulty; for as for &s;u&s;|pecting
him, if ever I &s;hould do it,
now was the time, and not put the
tru&s;t into his hands; and whenever I did
&s;u&s;pect him he could but throw it up
then and refu&s;e to go any farther. As to
executors, I a&s;&s;ured him I had no heirs,
nor any relations in England, and I
would have neither heirs or executors
but him&s;elf, unle&s;s I &s;hould alter my
condition, and then his tru&s;t and trou|ble
&s;hould cea&s;e together; but I told
him if I died as I was, it &s;hould be all
<PB N="150" REF="158">
his own, and he would de&s;erve it by
being &s;o faithful as I was &s;atisfied he
would be.</P>
<P>He changed his countenance and a&s;k'd
me, how I came to have &s;o much good
will for him? and looking plea&s;ed, &s;aid,
he might lawfully wi&s;h he was a &s;ingle
man for my &s;ake. I &s;miled and told
him, that as he was not, my offer could
have no de&s;ign upon him in it; and to
wi&s;h, as he did, was not to be allowed,
it was criminal to his wife.</P>
<P>He replied, I was wrong; for, &startq;ma|dam,
as I &s;aid before, I have a wife
and no wife.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I know nothing of your circum|&s;tances
that way, &s;ir, but it cannot be
innocent to wi&s;h your wife dead.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I tell you,&endq; &s;ays he again, &startq;&s;he is
a wife and no wife; you don't know
what I am, or what &s;he is.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That's true, &s;ir, I do not know
what you are; but I believe you to be
an hone&s;t man, and that's the cau&s;e of
my confidence in you.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, well,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;and &s;o I
am, I hope, but I am &s;omething el&s;e
<PB N="151" REF="159">
too, madam; for, to be plain with you,
&s;he is no better than &s;he &s;hould be.&endq;</P>
<P>I waved the di&s;cour&s;e, and began to
talk of my bu&s;ine&s;s; but I found he
could not have done with it, &s;o I let
him alone, and he went on to tell me
his ca&s;e, particularly, that having been
out of England &s;ome time before he
came to the po&s;t he was in, &s;he had had
two children by an officer of the army;
that when he came to England, and
upon her &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, took her again,
yet &s;he went away from him with a
linnen-draper's apprentice, robbed him
of what &s;he could come at, and conti|nued
to live from him &s;till; &startq;&s;o that,
madam, &s;he is lewd not by nece&s;&s;ity,
but by inclination, and for the &s;ake of
the vice.&endq;</P>
<P>I told him, I pitied him, and wi&s;hed
him well rid of her, and &s;till would
have talked of my bu&s;ine&s;s; but it would
not do. At la&s;t he looks &s;teadily at me,
&startq;Look you, madam, you came to a&s;k
advice of me; but I mu&s;t turn the
tables, &s;ince you are &s;o friendly, and I
mu&s;t a&s;k advice of you; tell me what
<PB N="152" REF="160">
can I do to do my&s;elf ju&s;tice upon
her?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Alas, &s;ir, 'tis a ca&s;e too nice for me
to advi&s;e in, but it &s;eems &s;he has run
away from you, &s;o you are rid of her;
what can you de&s;ire more? She may
indeed run you into debt, but the law
has furni&s;hed you with methods to pre|vent
it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, no, that is not the ca&s;e, it
is not that part that I &s;peak of. I
would be rid of her &s;o that I might mar|ry
again.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, &s;ir, then you mu&s;t divorce
her.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That, madam, is very tedious and
expen&s;ive.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, &s;ir, if you can get any wo|man
you like to take your word, I &s;up|po&s;e
your wife would not di&s;pute the li|berty
with you that &s;he takes her&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ay, but it would be hard to bring
an hone&s;t woman to do that; and for
the other &s;ort, I have had enough of
her to meddle with any more.&endq;</P>
<P>I replied, &startq;Why you &s;hut the door
again&s;t any hone&s;t woman accepting
you, for you condemn all that &s;hould
<PB N="153" REF="161">
venture upon you at once, and con|clude,
that really a woman that takes
you now, cannot be hone&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I wi&s;h you would &s;atisfy me that
an hone&s;t woman would take me, I
would venture it. Will you take me ma|dam?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That is not a fair que&s;tion, &s;ir, af|ter
what you have &s;aid; however, le&s;t
you &s;hould think I wait only for a re|cantation
of it, I &s;hall an&s;wer you plain|ly,
No; my bu&s;ine&s;s is of another kind,
and I did not expect you would have
turned my &s;erious application into a
comic one.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, madam, my ca&s;e is as &s;erious
as your's can be, and I &s;tand in as much
need of advice as you do; for I know
not what cour&s;e to take, I prote&s;t to
you.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, &s;ir, it is ea&s;y to give advice in
your ca&s;e, much ea&s;ier than it is in mine.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Speak then, madam, I beg of you,
for now you encourage me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, &s;ir, if your ca&s;e is &s;o plain
as you &s;ay it is, you may be legally di|vorced,
and then you may find hone&s;t
women enough to a&s;k the que&s;tion;
<PB N="154" REF="162">
the &s;ex is not &s;o &s;carce that you can want
a wife.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well then, I am in earne&s;t, I will
take your advice; but &s;hall I a&s;k you one
que&s;tion &s;eriou&s;ly.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Any que&s;tion, &s;ir, but that you did
before.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, madam, that an&s;wer will not
do, for that is the que&s;tion I &s;hall a&s;k.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You may a&s;k what que&s;tions you
plea&s;e, but you have my an&s;wer already;
be&s;ides, &s;ir, can you think &s;o ill of me,
as that I would give any an&s;wer to &s;uch
a que&s;tion before-hand? Can any wo|man
believe you in earne&s;t, or think you
de&s;ign any thing but to banter her?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I a&s;&s;ure you, madam, I do not
banter you, I am in earne&s;t, pray con|&s;ider
of it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But, &s;ir, I came to you about my
own bu&s;ine&s;s; I beg of you let me know,
what you will advi&s;e me to do?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I will be prepared, madam, again&s;t
you come again.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Nay, &s;ir, you have forbid my com|ing
any more.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why &s;o?&endq; and he looked a little &s;ur|prized.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="163">
&startq;Becau&s;e, &s;ir, you cannot expect I
&s;hould vi&s;it you on the account you talk
of.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, madam, you &s;hall promi&s;e
me to come again, and I will not &s;ay
any more of it until it is done; but I
de&s;ire you will prepare to be better con|ditioned,
for you &s;hall be the woman;
why I owe it to your unlooked-for kind|ne&s;s,
if it were to nothing el&s;e; but
I have other rea&s;ons too.&endq;</P>
<P>I &s;aid very re&s;pectfully, it was
time enough to con&s;ider of the&s;e things
when he was in a condition to talk of
them; in the mean time, I told him, I
was going a great way from him, and
he would find objects enough to plea&s;e
him better. We broke off here for the
pre&s;ent, and he made me promi&s;e him
to come egain the next day, for his re&s;o|lutions
upon my own bu&s;ine&s;s; which
after &s;ome pre&s;&s;ing, I did.</P>
<P>We had now a &s;econd conference
upon the &s;ubject. He prote&s;ted his af|fection
to me, and indeed, I had no
room to doubt it; he declared that it
began the fir&s;t moment I talked with
him. He then told me, how much the
<PB N="156" REF="164">
offer I had made of tru&s;ting him with
my effects, and leaving them to him,
had engaged him. He then &s;aid he had
a propo&s;al to make, which I &s;hould pro|mi&s;e
him I would not take ill, if I
&s;hould not grant it. I told him I hoped
he would make no di&s;honourable pro|po&s;al,
e&s;pecially in his own hou&s;e; and
that if it was &s;uch, I de&s;ired he would
not propo&s;e it, that I might not be
obliged to offer any re&s;entment that
did not become the re&s;pect I profe&s;&s;ed,
and the tru&s;t I had placed in him in
coming to his hou&s;e; and begged he
would give me leave to go: and I began
to put on my gloves, and prepare to be
gone.</P>
<P>Still he importuned me not to talk of
going: he a&s;&s;ured me he had no di&s;ho|nourable
thing in his thoughts about
me, and was very far from offering any
thing to me that was di&s;honourable; and
if I thought &s;o, he would choo&s;e to &s;ay
no more of it.</P>
<P>I told him, I was ready to hear any
thing that he had to &s;ay, depending that
he would &s;ay nothing unworthy of him|&s;elf,
or unfit for me to hear. Upon this,
<PB N="157" REF="165">
he told me his propo&s;al was, that I
would marry him, though he had not
yet obtained the divorce from his wife;
and to &s;atisfy me that he meant honour|ably,
he would promi&s;e not to de&s;ire me
to live with him, or to bed with him,
until the divorce was obtained.</P>
<P>I declined the motion with &s;ome
warmth, and &s;aid, that &s;uch a pro|po&s;al
would be of no &s;ignification, but
to entangle us both in great difficulties;
for if he &s;hould not at la&s;t obtain the
divorce, we could not di&s;&s;olve the mar|riage,
neither could we proceed in it;
&s;o that if he was di&s;appointed, I left
him to con&s;ider what a condition we
&s;hould both be in.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I carried on the argument
again&s;t this &s;o far, that I convinced him, it
was not a propo&s;al that had any meaning
in it. Then he went from it to another,
and that was, that I would &s;ign a con|tract
with him, conditioning to marry
him as &s;oon as the divorce was ob|tained,
and to be void if he could not
obtain it.</P>
<P>I told him that was more rational
than the other; but as this was the fir&s;t
<PB N="158" REF="166">
time that ever I could imagine him weak
enough to be in earne&s;t, I did not u&s;e
to &s;ay Yes at fir&s;t a&s;king; I would con&s;i|der
of it.</P>
<P>In a word I avoided a contract; and
told him I was going into the North,
that he &s;hould know where to write to
me in con&s;equence of the bu&s;ine&s;s I
had intru&s;ted him with; that I would
give him a &s;ufficient pledge of my re|&s;pect
for him, for I would leave almo&s;t
all I had in the world in his hands; and
I would thus far give him my word,
that as &s;oon as he had &s;ued out a di|vorce,
if he would &s;end me an account
of it I would &s;ome up to London; that
then we would talk &s;eriou&s;ly of the mat|ter:
and I took my leave of him.</P>
<P>In a few days after, I went with my
friend, as I called her, into Lanca&s;hire.
All the way &s;he care&s;&s;ed me with the ut|mo&s;t
appearance of a &s;incere undi&s;&s;em|bled
affection; her brother brought a
gentleman's coach to Warrington, to re|ceive
us, and we were carried from
thence to Leverpoole with as much cere|mony
as I could de&s;ire: we were al&s;o
entertained at a merchant's hou&s;e in
<PB N="159" REF="167">
Leverpoole three or four days very hand|&s;omely.
Then &s;he told me &s;he would
carry me to an uncle's hou&s;e of her's,
where we &s;hould be nobly entertained.
She did &s;o: her uncle, as &s;he called him,
&s;ent a coach and four hor&s;es for us, and
we were carried near forty miles, I know
not whither.</P>
<P>We came, however, to a gentleman's
&s;eat, where was a numerous family, a
large park, extraordinary company in|deed,
and where &s;he was c$lled cou&s;in.
I told her if &s;he had re&s;olved to bring
me into &s;uch company, &s;he &s;hould have
let me have prepared my&s;elf, and have
&s;urni&s;hed my&s;elf with cloaths. The la|dies
took notice of that, and told me
very genteely, they did not value peo|ple
in their country &s;o much by their
cloaths, as they did in London; that
their cou&s;in had fully informed them of
my quality, and that I did not want
cloaths to &s;et me off; in &s;hort, they en|tertained
me not like what I was, but
like what they thought I had been,
namely, a widow lady of a great for|tune.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="168">
I &s;tay'd here &s;ix weeks; and then my
conductor led me back to a country
village, about &s;ix miles from Lever|poole,
where her brother, as &s;he called
him, came to vi&s;it me in his own cha|riot,
and the next morning he made love
to me.</P>
<P>However, in all appearance this bro|ther
was a match worth my li&s;tening to,
and the lea&s;t his e&s;tate was valued at,
was a thou&s;and pounds a year; but the
&s;i&s;ter &s;aid it was worth fifteen hundred
pounds a year, and lay mo&s;t of it in lre|land.</P>
<P>I that was a great fortune, or pa&s;&s;ed
for &s;uch, was above being a&s;ked how
much my e&s;tate was; and my fal&s;e
friend, taking it upon a fooli&s;h hear&s;ay,
had rai&s;ed it from five hundred pounds
to five thou&s;and, and by the time
&s;he came into the country, &s;he called
it fifteen thou&s;and. The Iri&s;hman, her
brother, for &s;uch I under&s;tood him to
be, was &s;tark mad at this bait. He had,
to give him his due, the appearance of
the fine gentleman: he was tall, well
&s;haped, and had an extraordinary ad|dre&s;s;
talked as naturally of his park,
<PB N="161" REF="169">
his &s;tables, hor&s;es, his game-keepers,
woods, and his tenants, as if he had
been in the man&s;ion-hou&s;e, and I had
&s;een them all about me.</P>
<P>He never &s;o much as a&s;ked me about
my fortune, or e&s;tate; but a&s;&s;ured me
that when he came to Dublin he would
jointure me in &s;ix hundred pounds a
year good land; and that he would en|ter
into a deed of &s;ettlement here, for
the performance of it.</P>
<P>This was &s;uch language as I had not
been u&s;ed to, and my female friend,
was for ever telling me how great her
brother lived. One time &s;he would come
for my orders, how I would have my
coach painted, and how lined; and ano|ther
time what cloaths I would chu&s;e:
In &s;hort, my eyes were dazzled, I had
now lo&s;t my power of &s;aying no, and
to cut the &s;tory &s;hort, I con&s;ented to be
married.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;ay, but I had &s;ome reflec|tions
upon the di&s;honourable for&s;aking
my faithful citizen, who loved me &s;in|cerely,
and who was endeavouring to
quit him&s;elf of a &s;candalous woman, by
whom he had been indeed barbarou&s;ly
<PB N="162" REF="170">
u&s;ed, and promi&s;ed him&s;elf infinite hap|pine&s;s
in his new choice; which choice
was now giving up her&s;elf to another in
a manner almo&s;t as &s;candalous as hers
could be.</P>
<P>But the glittering &s;hew of a great
e&s;tate, repre&s;ented every hour to my
imagination, hurried me away, and gave
me no time to think of London, or of
any thing there.</P>
<P>But the thing was done. I was now in
the arms of my new &s;pou&s;e, who ap|peared
&s;till the &s;ame as before, great
even to magnificence; and nothing le&s;s
than a thou&s;and pound, a year could &s;up|port
the equipage he appeared in.</P>
<P>After we had been married about a
month, he began to talk of my going
to We&s;t-Che&s;ter in order to embark for
Ireland. However, he did not hurry
me, for we &s;taid near three weeks longer,
and then he &s;ent to Che&s;ter for a coach
to meet us at the Black Rock, as they
call it, over again&s;t Leverpoole. Thi|ther
we went in a fine pinnace, with &s;ix
oars, his &s;ervants, and hor&s;es, and bag|gage
going in the ferry-boat. He made
his excu&s;e to me, that he had no ac|quaintance
<PB N="163" REF="171">
at Che&s;ter, but he would go
before and get some hand&s;ome apart|ments
for me at a private hou&s;e. I a&s;k'd
him how long we &s;hould &s;tay at Che&s;ter?
he &s;aid, not at all, any longer than one
night or two, but he would immediately
hire a coach to go to Holyhead. Then I
told him he &s;hould by no means give
him&s;elf the trouble to get private lodg|ings
for one night or two, for that
Che&s;ter being a great place, I made no
doubt but there would be very good inns,
and accommodation enough; &s;o we
lodged at an inn in the We&s;t Street, not
far from the cathedral.</P>
<P>Here he talking of my going to Ire|land,
a&s;ked me, if I had any affairs
to &s;ettle at London before we went
off? I told him, not of any great con|&s;equence,
but what might be done as
well by letter from Dublin. &startq;Madam,&endq;
&s;ays he, very re&s;pectfully, &startq;I &s;uppo&s;e the
greate&s;t part of your e&s;tate, which my
&s;i&s;ter tells me is mo&s;t of it in money in
the bank of England, lies &s;ecure enough;
but in ca&s;e it requires transferring, or any
way altering its property, it will be
<PB N="164" REF="172">
nece&s;&s;ary to go up to London, and &s;ettle
tho&s;e things before we go over.&endq;</P>
<P>I looked &s;trange at it, and told him,
I knew not what he meant; that I had
no effects in the bank of England that
I knew of; and I hoped he could not
&s;ay, that I had ever told him I had.
No, he &s;aid, I had not told him &s;o, but
his &s;i&s;ter had &s;aid the greate&s;t part of
my e&s;tate lay there; &startq;and I only men|tioned
it my dear, that if there was any
occa&s;ion to &s;ettle it, or order any thing
about it, we might not be obliged to the
hazard and trouble of another voyage
back again,&endq; for he added, that he did
not care to venture me too much upon
the &s;ea.</P>
<P>I was &s;urpri&s;ed at this, and began to
con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly, what the meaning of
it mu&s;t be; and it pre&s;ently occurred to
me, that my friend, who called him
brother, had repre&s;ented me in colours
which were not my due; and I thought,
&s;ince it was come to that pitch, that I
would know the bottom of it before I
went out of England, and before I
&s;hould put my&s;elf into I knew not who&s;e
hands in a &s;trange country.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="173">
Upon this I called his &s;i&s;ter into my
chamber, and letting her know the di&s;|cour&s;e
her brother and I had heen upon
the evening before, I de&s;ired her to tell
me, what &s;he had &s;aid to him, and upon
what footing it was that &s;he had made
this marriage? She owned, that &s;he had
informed him, that I was a great for|tune;
and &s;aid, that &s;he was told &s;o at
London.</P>
<P>&startq;Told &s;o,&endq; &s;ays I, warmly, &startq;did I
ever tell you &s;o?&endq;</P>
<P>No, &s;he &s;aid, it was true I did not
tell her &s;o; but I had &s;aid &s;everal times,
that what I had was in my own di&s;po&s;al.</P>
<P>&startq;I did &s;o,&endq; replied I very ha&s;tily,
&startq;but I never told you, I had any thing
called a fortune; no, not that I had
one hundred pounds, or the value of an
hundred pounds in the world; and how
did it con&s;i&s;t with my being a fortune,
that I &s;hould come here into the north
of England with you, only upon the ac|count
of living cheap?&endq;</P>
<P>At the&s;e words, which I &s;poke warm
and &s;ighed, my hu&s;band, her brother as
&s;he called him, came into the room; and
I de&s;ired him to come and &s;it down, for
<PB N="166" REF="174">
I had &s;omething of moment to &s;ay be|fore
them both, which it was ab&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould hear.</P>
<P>He looked a little di&s;turbed at the
earne&s;tne&s;s with which I &s;eemed to &s;peak
it, and came and &s;at down by me, hav|ing
fir&s;t &s;hut the door; upon which I be|gan,
for I was very much provoked, and
turning my&s;elf to him, &startq;I am afraid,&endq;
&s;ays I, &startq;my dear,&endq; for I &s;poke with kind|ne&s;s
on his &s;ide, &startq;that you have a very
great abu&s;e put upon you, and an in|jury
done you never to be repaired, in
your marrying me, which, however, as
I have had no hand in it, I de&s;ire I may
be fairly acquitted of it; and that the
blame may lie where it ought to lie, and
no where el&s;e, for I wa&s;h my hands of
every part of it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What injury can be done me, my
dear,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;in marrying you? I
hope it is to my honour and advantage
every way.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I will &s;oon explain it to you,&endq; &s;ays
I, &startq;and I fear you will have no rea&s;on
to think your&s;elf well u&s;ed; but I will
convince you, my dear, that I have had
no hand it:&endq; and there I &s;topped.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="175">
He looked now &s;cared and wild, and
began, I believed, to &s;u&s;pect what fol|lowed;
however, looking towards me,
&s;aying only, &startq;Go on,&endq; he &s;at &s;ilent, as if
to hear what I had more to &s;ay.</P>
<P>&startq;I a&s;ked you la&s;t night,&endq; if ever I
made any boa&s;t to you of my e&s;tate in
the bank of England, or any where
el&s;e, and you owned I had not; and I
de&s;ire you will tell me here, before your
&s;i&s;ter, if ever I gave you any rea&s;on to
think &s;o, or that ever we had any di&s;|cour&s;e
about it: &startq;and he owned again, I
had not;&endq; but &s;aid, I had appeared as
a woman of fortune, and he depended
on it that I was &s;o, and hoped he was not
deceived.</P>
<P>&startq;I am not enquiring whether you
have been deceived or not;&endq; I fear you
have, and I too; but I am clearing
my&s;elf from the unju&s;t charge of
being concerned in deceiving you.
I have been now a&s;king your &s;i&s;ter
if ever I told her of any fortune or
e&s;tate I had, or gave her any particulars
of it; and &s;he owns, I never did:
&startq;And pray, madam&endq; turning my&s;elf
to her, &startq;be &s;o ju&s;t to be, before your
<PB N="168" REF="176">
brother, to charge me, if you can, if
ever I pretended to you that I had an
e&s;tate; and why, if I had, &s;hould I
come down into this country with you
on purpo&s;e to &s;pare that little I had, and
live cheap?&endq;</P>
<P>She could not deny one word, but
&s;aid &s;he had been told in London that I
had a very great fortune, and that it lay
in the bank of England.</P>
<P>&startq;And now, dear &s;ir,&endq; &s;aid I, turning
my&s;elf to him, &startq;be &s;o ju&s;t as to tell me
who has abu&s;ed both you and me &s;o
much, as to make you believe I was a
fortune, and prompt you to court me to
this marriage?&endq;</P>
<P>He could not &s;peak a word, but
pointed to her; and after &s;ome pau&s;e,
flew into the mo&s;t furious pa&s;&s;ion that
ever I &s;aw a man in my life; cur&s;ing
her, and calling her all the names he
could think of; and that &s;he had ruined
him, declaring, that &s;he had told him I
had fifteen thou&s;and pounds, and that
&s;he was to have five hundred pounds of
him for procuring this match. He then
added, that &s;he was none of his &s;i&s;ter,
but had been his mi&s;tre&s;s for two years
<PB N="169" REF="177">
before, that &s;he had had one hundred
pounds in part of this bargain, and
that he was utterly undone if things
were as I &s;aid; and in his raving, he
&s;wore, he would let her heart's blood
out immediately, which frighted her and
me too; &s;he cried, &s;aid &s;he had been
told &s;o in the hou&s;e where I lodged;
but this aggravated him more than be|fore
that &s;he &s;hould put &s;o far upon
him, and run things &s;uch a length upon
no other authority than hear&s;ay; and
&s;aid very hone&s;tly, he was afraid we
were both undone; &startq;for to be plain, my
dear, I have no e&s;tate, what little I had,
this devil has made me run out in wait|ing
on you, and putting me into this
equipage.&endq; She took the opportunity of
his talking with me, got out of the
room, and I never &s;aw her more.</P>
<P>I was confounded now as much as he,
and knew not what to &s;ay: I thought
many ways that I had the wor&s;t of it,
but his &s;aying, he was undone, and that he
had no e&s;tate neither, put me into a meer
di&s;traction. &startq;Why,&endq; &s;ays I, &startq;this has
been a juggle, for we are married here
upon a double fraud; you are undone by
<PB N="170" REF="178">
the di&s;appointment, and I if had had a
a fortune I had been cheated too.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You would indeed have been cheated,
my dear,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;but you would not
have been undone; for fifteen thou&s;and
pounds would have maintained us both
very hand&s;omely in this country; and I
a&s;&s;ure you,&endq; added he, &startq;I had re&s;olved to
have dedicated all of it to you, I would
not have wronged you of a &s;hilling;&endq; and
the re&s;t I would have made up in my
affection, and tenderne&s;s of you as long
as I lived.</P>
<P>This was very hone&s;t, and I really
believed he &s;poke as he intended, and
he was a man that was as well qualified
to make me happy, as to his temper and
behaviour, as any man ever was; but
his having no e&s;tate, and being run into
debt on this ridiculous account in the
country, made all the pro&s;pect di&s;mal
and dreadful, and I knew not what to
&s;ay, or what to think.</P>
<P>I told him it was very unhappy, that
&s;o much love, and &s;o much good-na|ture,
as I di&s;covered in him, &s;hould be
thus precipitated into mi&s;ery; that I
<PB N="171" REF="179">
&s;aw nothing before us but ruin: for as
to me, it was my unhappine&s;s, that
what little I had was not able to relieve
us long, and with that I pulled out a
bank bill of thirty pounds and eleven
guineas, which I told him I had &s;aved
out of my little income; and by the ac|count
&s;he had given me of the way
of living in that country, I expected
it would maintain me two or three
years; that if it was taken from me I
was left de&s;titute, and he knew what the
condition of a woman among &s;trangers
mu&s;t be, if &s;he had no money; how|ever,
I told him if he would take it,
there it was.</P>
<P>He replied with great concern, and I
thought I &s;aw tears &s;tand in his eyes,
he would not touch it; that he abhorred
the thoughts of &s;tripping me, and
making me mi&s;erable; that on the con|trary,
he had fifty guineas left, which
was all he had in the world; and he
pulled them out and threw them on the
table, bidding me take them, though he
were to &s;tarve for the want of them.</P>
<P>I returned, with the &s;ame concern for
him, that I could not bear to hear him
<PB N="172" REF="180">
talk &s;o; on the contrary, if he could
propo&s;e any probable method of living.
I would do any thing that became me on
my part, and that I would live as clo&s;e
and as narrow as he could de&s;ire.</P>
<P>He begged of me to talk no more at
that rate, for it would make him di&s;|tracted;
he &s;aid he was bred a gentle|man,
though he was reduced to a low
fortune; and there was but one way
left which he could think of, and that
would not do, unle&s;s I could an&s;wer him
one que&s;tion, which, however, he &s;aid,
he would not pre&s;s me to. I told him I
would an&s;wer it hone&s;tly, whether it
would be to his &s;atisfaction or not.</P>
<P>&startq;Why then, my dear, tell me plain|le,
will the little you have keep us toge|ther
in any figure, or will it not?&endq;</P>
<P>I told him I never willingly deceived
him, and I never would: I was very
&s;orry to &s;ay that the little I had would
not &s;ub&s;i&s;t us; that it was not &s;ufficient
to &s;ub&s;i&s;t me alone in the South coun|try;
and that this was the rea&s;on that
made me put my&s;elf into the hands of
that wretch &s;he having a&s;&s;ured me that
I might board very hand&s;omely at a
<PB N="173" REF="181">
town, where I had not yet been, for
about eight pounds a year, and my
whole income not being above fifteen
pounds a year, I thought I might live
ea&s;y upon it, and wait for better things.</P>
<P>He &s;hook his head and remained &s;i|lent,
and a very melancholy evening we
had. However, when we had almo&s;t
&s;upped, he looked a little better and
more chearful, and called for a bottle
of wine; &startq;Come, my dear, tho' the
ca&s;e is bad it is to no purpo&s;e to be de|jected:
be as ea&s;y as you can,&endq; I will en|deavour
to find out &s;ome way to live;
if you can but &s;ub&s;i&s;t your&s;elf, I mu&s;t
try the world again; a man ought to
think like a man: To be di&s;couraged,
is to yield to the misfortune: with this
he filled a gla&s;s, and drank to me, hold|ing
my hand, and pre&s;&s;ing it hard in
his, and prote&s;ting afterward his main
concern was for me.</P>
<P>It was really a truly gallant &s;pirit he
was of, and it was the more grievous to
me: 'Tis &s;omething of relief even to be
undone by a man of honour; but here
the greate&s;t di&s;appointment was on his
&s;ide, for he had really &s;pent a great deal
<PB N="174" REF="182">
of money, deluded by this procure&s;s.
The de&s;ign of deluding a woman of for|tune,
if I had been &s;o, was ba&s;e; the
putting the face of great things upon
poor circum&s;tances was a fraud; but
the ca&s;e a little differed too, and that in
his favour, for he was not a rake that
made a trade to delude women, and as
&s;ome have done get &s;ix or &s;even fortunes
after one another, and then rifle and
leave them; but he was really a gentle|man,
unfortunate and low, but had
lived well; and though if I had had a
fortune I &s;hould have been enraged at
the &s;lut for betraying me; yet, really
for the man, a fortune would not have
been ill be&s;towed on him, for he was a
lovely per&s;on, of generous principles,
good &s;en&s;e, and of abundance of good-humour.</P>
<P>We had a deal of conver&s;ation that
night, for we neither of us &s;lept much;
he was as penitent, for having put tho&s;e
cheats upon me as if it had been fe|lony;
he offered me again every &s;hilling
of the money he had about him, and
&s;aid, he would go into the army and &s;eek
the world for more.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="183">
I a&s;ked him, how he could be &s;o un|kind
to propo&s;e to carry me into Ire|land,
when he knew he could not
maintain me when he had got me there?</P>
<P>He took me in his arms, &startq;My dear,
I do a&s;&s;ure you, upon my honour, if
you will allow me the expre&s;&s;ion, I
never intended to go to Ireland, much
le&s;s to have carried you there; but
came hither to be concealed from tho&s;e,
who had heard what I pretended to,
and, that nobody might a&s;k me for
money before I was furni&s;hed to &s;upply
them.&endq;</P>
<P>I replied, &startq;But where then, Mr. Car|rol,
were we to have gone next?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, my dear, I will confe&s;s the
whole &s;cheme as I had laid it. I pur|po&s;ed
here to a&s;k you &s;omething about
your e&s;tate, and when you had entered
into &s;ome account with me of the par|ticular,
I would have made an excu&s;e,
to have put off our voyage to Ireland
for &s;ome time, and to have gone fir&s;t to|wards
London. Then, my dear, I re|&s;olved
to have confe&s;&s;ed all the circum|&s;tances
of my own affairs, and let you
<PB N="176" REF="184">
know I had indeed made u&s;e of the&s;e
artifices to obtain your con&s;ent to marry
me, but had now nothing to do but to
a&s;k your pardon, and to tell you how
abundantly, I would endeavour to make
you forget what was pa&s;t, by the felicity
of the days to come.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Indeed, Mr. Carrol, I find you
would &s;oon have conquered me; and it
is my affliction, that I am not in a con|dition
to let you &s;ee how ea&s;ily I &s;hould
have been reconciled, and have pa&s;&s;ed
by all you have put upon me, in recom|pence
of &s;o much good-humour&punc; but&punc;
my dear, what can we do now? We
are both undone, and what better are we
for our being reconciled, &s;eeing we have
nothing to live on?&endq;</P>
<P>He begged me at la&s;t to talk no
more of it, for he &s;aid, I &s;hould break
his heart; &s;o we talked of other things
a little, until at la&s;t he took a hu&s;|band's
leave of me, and we both fell a
&s;leep.</P>
<P>In the morning on the table, I found
the following letter.</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="177" REF="185">
<OPENER>&startq;My dear,&endq;</OPENER>
<P>&startq;Having been drawn in, by an in|famous
woman, to do an action con|trary
to the general practice of my life,
highly to your prejudice, I implore
your forgivene&s;s with the greate&s;t &s;ince|rity.
Con&s;cious of my being unable to
&s;upport you, and grieved in knowing I
am the author of your ruin, I am de|termined
never to trouble you more,
unle&s;s fortune &s;hould &s;o favour me as to
bring you relief; then it &s;hall be yours,
and all yours, wherever I may be &s;o
happy as to find you. Until that ble&s;&s;ed
time arrive, &s;hall be the con&s;tant prayer
of your affectionate, though as pre&s;ent
unfortunate hu&s;band,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>JAMES CARROL.&endq;</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Nothing that ever befel me, &s;unk
&s;o deep into my heart as this; and what
added to it, upon &s;earching in my pock|et,
I there found he had put in ten
guineas, his gold watch, and two dia|mond
rings.</P>
<P>I kept my &s;eat for hours together,
until my maid interrupted me, by tel|ling
<PB N="178" REF="186">
me my dinner was ready; then I
fell into a vehement fit of crying. Thus
I pa&s;t the afternoon, until about &s;even
o'clock; when, to my un&s;peakable &s;ur|pri&s;e,
he came into my chamber.</P>
<P>He no &s;ooner entered the room, but
he ran to me and took me in his
arms, holding me fa&s;t and almo&s;t &s;top|ping
my breath with his ki&s;&s;es, but &s;poke
not a word. At length I began, &startq;My
dear, how could you go and leave me?&endq;
To which he gave no an&s;wer.</P>
<P>When our ec&s;ta&s;ies were a little over,
he told me he went about fifteen miles,
but it was not in his power to go any
farther, without coming back to &s;ee me
again, and to take his leave of me, he
&s;aid, for ever.</P>
<P>Enfolding him clo&s;e in my arms,
&startq;You &s;hall leave me no more,&endq; &s;aid I;
&startq;I will go over the world with you
rather.&endq;</P>
<P>He replied, it was difficult for him
to leave me, but &s;ince it mu&s;t be, he
hoped I would make it as ea&s;y to my|&s;elf
as I could; but as for him, it would
be his de&s;truction.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="187">
However, he con&s;idered he had left
me to travel to London alone, which
was too long a journey; and as he
might as well go that way, as any way
el&s;e, he re&s;olved to &s;ee me &s;afe thither,
or near it; and if he did go away
then without taking his leave, I &s;hould
not take it ill of him: and this he made
me promi&s;e.</P>
<P>He told me al&s;o he had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his
&s;ervants, &s;old their hor&s;es, and &s;ent the fel|lows
away to &s;eek their fortunes: &startq;and,&endq;
&s;aid he, &startq;it co&s;t me &s;ome tears by my&s;elf,
to think how much happier they were than
their ma&s;ter, for they could go to the
next gentleman's hou&s;e to &s;eek for a &s;er|vice,
whereas I knew not whither to
go, or what to do.</P>
<P>I &s;aid, I was &s;o compleatly mi&s;era|ble
in his leaving me, that I could not
be wor&s;e; and in the mean time I agreed
that we would go together to London;
but could not be brought to con&s;ent he
&s;hould go away, and not take his leave
of me as he propo&s;ed. Then I pulled
out his watch, his rings, and his ten
guineas; but he would not take them,
<PB N="180" REF="188">
which made me &s;u&s;pect that he re&s;olved
to go off upon the road, and leave me.</P>
<P>The truth is, the circum&s;tances he
was in, the expre&s;&s;ions of his letter, the
kind treatment I had from him in the
affair, with the concern he &s;hewed for
me in it; his manner of parting with
that large &s;hare which he gave me of
his little &s;tock left; all the&s;e had joined
to make &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions on me, that
I really loved him tenderly, and could
not bear the thought of parting with
him.</P>
<P>Two days after this we quitted
Che&s;ter, I in the &s;tage coach, and he on
hor&s;eback. He came with me as far as
Dun&s;table, about thirty-five miles from
London; then he told me fate and his
own misfortunes obliged him to leave
me, and I &s;aw him preparing to go.</P>
<P>Being in the inn, I acquainted him I
had one favour to a&s;k, which was, &s;ince
he could not go any farther, he would
give me leave to &s;tay a week or two in
the town with him, that we might think
of &s;omething to prevent &s;uch a ruinous
thing to us both, as a final &s;eparation
would be: that I had &s;omething of mo|ment
<PB N="181" REF="189">
to offer to him, which perhaps he
might find to our mutual advantage.</P>
<P>This was too rea&s;onable to be denied:
&s;o he called the landlady and told her,
his wife was taken &s;o ill that &s;he could
not go any farther, and a&s;ked if &s;he
could get us a lodging for two or three
days, for the journey had been too
much for me? The landlady, who was
well-bred, and very obliging, came im|mediately
to &s;ee me; told me, &s;he had
two or three very good rooms in the
hou&s;e, and if I &s;aw them, &s;he did not
doubt but I would like them, and I
&s;hould have one of her maids, to wait
on me. This was &s;o kind, that I could
not but accept of it and thank her; &s;o
we paid the &s;tage-coachman, took out
our baggage and re&s;olved to &s;tay.</P>
<P>In the evening taking a walk into the
fields, I told him I would now acquaint
him with the propo&s;al I had to make.
Accordingly I related to him how I had
lived in Virginia; that I had a mother,
I believed, was alive there &s;till, though
my hu&s;band had been dead &s;ome years.</P>
<P>Then I entered into the manner of
peoples going over to tho$e countries to
<PB N="182" REF="190">
&s;ettle; how they had a quantity of land
given them by the con&s;titution of the
place; and if not, it might be pur|cha&s;ed
at &s;o ea&s;y a rate that it was not
worth naming.</P>
<P>I then gave him a di&s;tinct account of
the nature of planting; how with carry|ing
over two or three hundred pounds
value in Engli&s;h goods, a man of ap|plication
would be certain to rai&s;e an
e&s;tate.</P>
<P>I let him into the nature of the pro|duct
of the earth, how the ground was
prepared, and what the u&s;ual increa&s;e
of it was; and demon&s;trated in a few
years, with &s;uch a beginning, we &s;hould
be as certain of being rich, as we were
now certain of being poor.</P>
<P>He was &s;urpri&s;ed at my di&s;cour&s;e; for
we made it the &s;ubject of our conver&s;a|tion
for near a week, in which time I
laid it down, that it was morally im|po&s;&s;ible,
but that we mu&s;t thrive and do
well.</P>
<P>Then I told him what mea&s;ures I
would take to rai&s;e a &s;um of three hun|dred
pounds; and I argued how good a
method it would be to put an end to
<PB N="183" REF="191">
our misfortunes, and re&s;tore our cir|cum&s;tances,
to what we had both ex|pected;
and I added, that after a few
years, if we lived, we might leave our
plantation in good hands, come over
again, receive the income of it, and
live here and enjoy it; and I gave him
examples of &s;ome that had done &s;o, and
who now lived in very good circum|&s;tances
in London.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I pre&s;&s;ed him &s;o, that he
almo&s;t agreed to it: but &s;till &s;omething
or other broke it off again; until at
la&s;t he turned the tables, and began to
talk almo&s;t to the &s;ame purpo&s;e of Ire|land.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, a man that could confine
him&s;elf to a country-life, and could
but find &s;tock to enter upon any land,
could have a farm there for fifty pounds
a year, as good as were here let for
two hundred pounds; the produce was
&s;uch, and &s;o rich the land, if much was
not laid up, we were &s;ure to live hand|&s;omely
upon it: that he had laid a
&s;cheme to leave me in London, and go
over and try; and if he found he could
<PB N="184" REF="192">
lay a foundation of living, he would
come over and fetch me, or, that if he
found nothing could be done in Ireland,
he would then come and join in my pro|ject
for Virginia.</P>
<P>A month at Dun&s;table being expired&punc;
at la&s;t we parted, though with the ut|mo&s;t
reluctance on my &s;ide; and in|deed,
he took his leave very unwilling|ly
too, but nece&s;&s;ity obliged him: why
he would not come to London, I un|der&s;tood
more fully afterwards.</P>
<P>I came to London the next day, and
took a lodging in St. John's Street,
Clerkenwell. Here, I had lei&s;ure to re|flect
upon the la&s;t &s;even months ramble;
the plea&s;ant hours I had with Mr.
Carrol, I looked back with infinite plea|&s;ure;
but that plea&s;ure was very much
le&s;&s;ened, when I found, &s;ome time after,
that I was with child.</P>
<P>Before I became acquainted with Mr.
Carrol, I had taken care to pre&s;erve a cor|re&s;pondence
with my friend at the bank, or
rather he took care to corre&s;pond with me,
for he wrote to me frequently. I al&s;o
wrote to him, and I left directions in
Lanca&s;hire, &s;o that I had tho&s;e letters,
<PB N="185" REF="193">
which he &s;ent, conveyed to me, and
during my rece&s;s in Saint John's Street,
I received a very obliging letter from
him, that if I would come to town he
&s;hould &s;hortly be ready to fulfil his en|gagements;
a&s;&s;uring me his proce&s;s for
a divorce from his wife went on with
&s;ucce&s;s, though he met with &s;ome dif|ficulties
in it that he did not expect.</P>
<P>I was not di&s;plea&s;ed that his proce&s;s
was more tedious than he expected;
for though I was in no condition to
have him, being with child, yet I was
not willing to lo&s;e him, and re&s;olved to
have him if he continued in the &s;ame
mind, as &s;oon at I was up again; for I
&s;aw apparently I &s;hould hear no more
from Mr. Carrol; and as he had all
along pre&s;&s;ed me to marry, and had
a&s;&s;ured me he would not ever offer to
claim me again, &s;o I made no &s;cruple to
re&s;olve to do it if I could, if my city-friend
&s;tood to his bargain; and I had
a great deal of rea&s;on to be a&s;&s;ured that
he would &s;tand to it, by the letters he
wrote.</P>
<P>As I had not the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of my
being with child, when I came to town,
<PB N="186" REF="194">
I pa&s;&s;ed for a widow; but now grow|ing
big, my landlady where I lodged
perceived it, and began to take notice
of it, and as far as civility would al|low,
intimated that I mu&s;t think of re|moving.
Upon this, I told her my ca&s;e,
as it really was; and that my hu&s;band,
Mr. Carrol, was gone to Ireland, and
begged her advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance in what
I &s;hould do.</P>
<P>My landlady was not &s;o great a
&s;tranger to &s;uch ca&s;es as mine, as I
thought at fir&s;t &s;he had been, and &s;he
&s;ent for a midwife. When &s;he came,
my landlady &s;aid, &startq;Mrs. Broadwell,
I believe this lady's trouble is of a
kind that is pretty much in your way,
and therefore, if you can do any thing
for her, pray do, for &s;he is a very civil
lady,&endq; and immediately &s;he went out of
the room.</P>
<P>I really did not under&s;tand her: but
Mrs. Broadwell began very &s;eriou&s;ly to
explain what &s;he meant. &startq;Madam, you
&s;eem not to under&s;tand what your land|lady
means: She means that you are
under &s;ome circum&s;tances that may
render your lying-in difficult, and that
<PB N="187" REF="195">
you are not willing to be expo&s;ed; I
need &s;ay no more. If you think fit to
commu$icate &s;o much of your ca&s;e, as
is nece&s;&s;ary, I may be in a condition to
a&s;&s;i&s;t you, and to make you perfectly
ea&s;y.&endq;</P>
<P>I was too &s;en&s;ible of the want I was
in of &s;uch a woman, not to accept her
offer. I told her my ca&s;e was partly as
&s;he gue&s;&s;ed, and partly not; for I was
really married, and had a hu&s;band, tho'
he was in &s;uch circum&s;tances, and &s;o re|mote
at that time, as that he could not
appear publickly.</P>
<P>She, with a deal of re&s;pect, told me,
that was none of her bu&s;ine&s;s; all the
ladies that came under her care were mar|ried
women to her; every woman what
is with child has a father for it, and
whether that father was a hu&s;band or
not, was no bu&s;ine&s;s of her's; her bu&s;i|ne&s;s
was to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in my pre&s;ent cir|cum&s;tances,
whether I had a hu&s;band or
no; &startq;for, madam, to have a hu&s;band
that cannot appear, is to have no hu&s;|band
in the &s;en&s;e of the ca&s;e, and there|fore,
whether you are a wife or not is
all one to me.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="196">
I &s;oon found, that whether I was a
wife or a mi&s;tre&s;s, I was to pa&s;s for a
mi&s;tre&s;s with her. I &s;aid, however, if I
mu&s;t tell her my ca&s;e, I mu&s;t tell it her
as it was: So I related it, and con|cluded
thus; &startq;I trouble you with all
this, madam, not that it is much to the
purpo&s;e in your affair, but this is to the
purpo&s;e, namely, that I am not in any
pain about being &s;een, or being publick
or concealed, for it is perfectly indif|ferent
to me; but my difficulty is, that
I have no acquaintance in this part of
London.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I under&s;tand you, madam; you
have no &s;ecurity to bring to prevent the
pari&s;h impertinences u&s;ual in &s;uch ca&s;es;
and perhaps, do not know very well
how to di&s;po&s;e of the child when it
comes.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The la&s;t, &s;ays I, is not &s;o much my
concern as the fir&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, madam, I live in Saint John's
Square, and though I do not enquire
after you, you may enquire after me,
for I have many ladies that come to
my hou&s;e to lye-in. I have given &s;ecu|rity
to the pari&s;h to &s;ecure them from
<PB N="189" REF="197">
any charge, from what&s;oever &s;hall come
into the world under my roof. I have
but one que&s;tion to a&s;k, madam, and if
that be an&s;wered, you &s;hall be entirely
ea&s;y for all the re&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Madam, I believe I under&s;tand
you. I thank God, though I want
frends in this part of the world, I do not
want money, &s;o far as may be nece&s;&s;ary,
though I do not abound in it.&endq;</P>
<P>This I added, becau&s;e I would not
make her expect great things.</P>
<P>&startq;Well, madam, that is the thing in|deed,
without which nothing can be
done in the&s;e ca&s;es; and yet, you &s;hall
&s;ee I will not impo&s;e upon you, or offer
any thing that is unkind to you; and if
you de&s;ire it, you &s;hall know every thing
beforehand, that you may &s;uit your&s;elf
to the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I told her, &s;he &s;eemed to be perfectly
&s;en&s;ible of my condition: that I had no|thing
to a&s;k of her but this, that as I had
told her that I had money &s;ufficient, but
not a great quantity, &s;he would order it
&s;o, that I might be at as little &s;uper|fluous
charge as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="198">
She replied, that &s;he would bring in
an account of the expences of it in two
or three &s;hapes, and like a bill of fare,
I &s;hould choo&s;e as I plea&s;ed; and I de|&s;ired
her to do &s;o.</P>

I looked upon all the three bills, and
&s;miled, and told her I did not &s;ee but
that &s;he was very rea&s;onable in her de|mands,
all things con&s;idered, and that
I did not doubt but her accommodations
were good; and added, I was &s;orry to
tell her that I feared I mu&s;t be her low|e&s;t
rated cu&s;tomer, &startq;and perhaps, ma|dam,
you will make me the le&s;s welcome
upon that account.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, not at all: but if you doubt
my care, I will allow any friend you have
to overlook, and &s;ee if you are well
waited on, or no.&endq;</P>
<P>I &s;miled, and told her I would come
and be her cu&s;tomer; but I told her
al&s;o, that as I had two months to go, I
might perhaps be obliged to &s;tay longer
with her than three months, and de&s;ired
to know if &s;he would not be obliged to
remove me before it was proper.</P>
<P>&startq;No, &s;he &s;aid her hou&s;e was large,
and be&s;ides, &s;he never put any body to
remove, that had lain in, until they
were willing to go; and if &s;he had more
ladies offered &s;he could provide accom|modation.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="201">
As &s;oon as I could, I went with the
maid to &s;ee the hou&s;e, and the apart|ment
I was to have; every thing was &s;o
hand&s;ome and &s;o clean, I was wonder|fully
plea&s;ed with what I had met with,
which, con&s;idering the melancholy cir|cum&s;tances
I was in, was far beyond
what I looked for.</P>
<P>To bring this part into as narrow a
compa&s;s as po&s;&s;ible, I quitted my lodg|ing
and went to my governe&s;s, for &s;o
they called her in the hou&s;e, and there I
was treated with &s;o much courte&s;y, &s;o
carefully looked to, and &s;o hand&s;omely
provided, that I was &s;urpri&s;ed at it, and
could not at fir&s;t &s;ee what advantage my
governe&s;s made of it; but I found
afterwards that &s;he profe&s;&s;ed to make no
profit of the lodgers diet, nor could
&s;he get much by it, but her profit lay
in the other articles of her management,
and &s;he made enough that way, for it
is &s;carce credible what practice &s;he had,
yet all upon the private account, or, in
plain Engli&s;h, intriging.</P>
<P>While I was in her hou&s;e, which was
near four months, &s;he had above thirty
<PB N="194" REF="202">
unhappy young woman, who made a
good figure, brought to bed under her
care, who were chiefly girls in keep|ing.</P>
<P>This was a te&s;timony of the vice of
the age, and &s;uch a one, as bad as I had
been, it &s;hocked me; I began to nau|&s;eate
the place, and above all, the
wicked practice; yet I mu&s;t &s;ay that I
never &s;aw, or do I believe there was to
be &s;een, the lea&s;t indecency in the hou&s;e
the whole time I was there.</P>
<P>Not a man was ever &s;een to come up
&s;tairs, except to vi&s;it the lying-in ladies
within their month, nor then without
the old lady with them, who made it a
piece of the honour of her management,
that no man &s;hould touch a woman,
within the month; nor would &s;he per|mit
any man to lie in the hou&s;e upon
any pretence whatever, though &s;he was
&s;ure it was with his own wife; and her
&s;aying for it was, &s;he cared not how
many children were born in her hou&s;e,
but &s;he would have none got there if &s;he
could help it.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="203">
Before I was brought to bed, I re|ceived
a letter from my tru&s;tee at the
Bank, full of kind obliging expre&s;&s;ions,
earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ing me to return to Lon|don.
It was near a fortnight before
it came to me, becau&s;e it had been fir&s;t
&s;ent into Lanca&s;hire, and then directed
to me at my lodging in Saint John
Street as I before had ordered. He con|cluded
with telling me he had obtained
a decree again&s;t his wife, and that he
would be ready to make good his en|gagement,
if I would accept of him;
adding a great many prote&s;tations of
kindne&s;s and affection.</P>
<P>I returned an an&s;wer, and dated it at
Leverpoole, but &s;ent it by a me&s;&s;enger,
alledging that it came in cover to a
friend in town. I gave him joy of his
deliverance, but rai&s;ed &s;ome &s;cruples;
and told him, I &s;uppo&s;ed he would con|&s;ider
&s;eriou&s;ly before he re&s;olved, the
con&s;equence being too great for a man
of his judgment to venture ra&s;hly; &s;o
concluded, wi&s;hing him well in what|ever
he did re&s;olve, without letting him
into any thing of my own mind, or
<PB N="196" REF="204">
giving any an&s;wer to his propo&s;al of my
coming to London, but mentioned my
intention to return the latter end of the
year.</P>
<P>I was brought to bed about the mid|dle
of May, of a fine boy; and in
about three weeks after I lay-in, I re|ceived
another letter from him, with
the news that he had &s;uch an an&s;wer to
give to all my &s;cruples about his marry|ing
again, as I could not expect; for
his wife, who had been under &s;ome re|mor&s;e
before for her u&s;age of him, as
&s;oon as &s;he heard the account that he
had gained his point, had very unhap|pily
de&s;troyed her&s;elf.</P>
<P>He expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf very hand&s;ome|ly
as to his being concerned at her di&s;|a&s;ter,
and that he had only done him|&s;elf
ju&s;tice in a ca&s;e in which he was no|toriou&s;ly
injured: However, he had no
view of any &s;atisfaction left in this
world, but only in the hope that I
would come and relieve him by my
company. Then he pre&s;&s;ed me, that I
would come to town and let him &s;ee me,
<PB N="197" REF="205">
when he would farther enter into di&s;|cour&s;e
about it.</P>
<P>I was &s;urpri&s;ed at the news, and be|gan
&s;eriou&s;ly to reflect on my circum|&s;tances,
and the misfortune it was to
have a child; and what to do I knew
not. I appeared melancholy for &s;everal
days, and my governe&s;s que&s;tioned me
continually to know what troubled me.
I could not tell her I had an offer of
marriage, after I had &s;o often told her I
had a hu&s;band. I owned I had &s;ome|thing
which very much troubled me,
but &s;aid, &startq;I could not reveal it.&endq;</P>
<P>She &s;till continued importuning me.
It was impo&s;&s;ible, I told her, to di&s;cover
the &s;ecret. This, in&s;tead of being an
an&s;wer, encrea&s;ed her importunities; &s;he
urged her having been tru&s;ted with the
greate&s;t &s;ecrets; that it was her bu&s;ine&s;s
to conceal every thing, and to di&s;cover
things of any nature would be her ruin;
&s;he a&s;ked me if ever I had found her
tattling of other peoples affairs, and
how could I &s;u&s;pect her? and to unfold
my&s;elf to her, was telling it to no|body;
<PB N="198" REF="206">
&s;he was &s;ilent as death; it mu&s;t
be a &s;trange ca&s;e indeed, that &s;he could
not help me out of; but to conceal it,
was to deprive my&s;elf of all po&s;&s;ible
help, or means of help, and to deprive
her of the opportunity of &s;erving me.
In &s;hort, &s;he had &s;uch a bewitching elo|quence,
and &s;o great a power of per|&s;ua&s;ion,
there was no concealing any
thing from her.</P>
<P>At length, I told her the hi&s;tory of
my Lanca&s;hire marriage, how both of
us had been di&s;appointed, how we came
together, and how we parted. Here I
told her what a good offer I had; pro|duced
her my friend's two la&s;t letters,
inviting me to come to London, and
&s;hewed her with what affection and
earne&s;tne&s;s they were written.</P>
<P>She fell a laughing, and told me the
other was no marriage, but a cheat on
both &s;ides; and as we were parted by
mutual con&s;ent, the nature of the con|tract
was de&s;troyed, and the obligation
was mutually di&s;charged. She had ar|guments
for this at the tip of her
tongue; and in &s;hort, rea&s;oned me out
<PB N="199" REF="207">
of my rea&s;on; not but that it was too
by the help of my own inclination.</P>
<P>Then came the great and main dif|ficulty,
and that was the child. This
&s;he told me mu&s;t be removed, &s;o as
it &s;hould never be po&s;&s;ible for any one
to di&s;cover it. I knew there was no
marrying without entirely concealing
that I had had a child, for he would
&s;oon di&s;cover by the age of it, that it
was born, nay, and gotten too, &s;ince my
acquaintance with him.</P>
<P>But it touched my heart to think of
parting with the child. I could not
think of it, without horror. I wi&s;h all
tho&s;e women who con&s;ent to the di&s;|po&s;ing
of their children out of the way,
as it is called for decency &s;ake, would
con&s;ider that it is only a contrived me|thod
for murther; that is to &s;ay, a kill|ing
their children with &s;afety.</P>
<P>It is manife&s;t to all that under&s;tand
any thing of children, that we are born
helple&s;s, and uncapable either to &s;up|ply
our own wants, or &s;o much as
make them known; and that without
help, we mu&s;t peri&s;h; and this help re|quires
not only an a&s;&s;i&s;ting hand, whe|ther
<PB N="200" REF="208">
of the mother, or &s;omebody el&s;e,
but there are two things nece&s;&s;ary in that
a&s;&s;i&s;ting hand, that is, care and &s;kill,
without both which, half the children
that are born would die. I que&s;tion not,
but the&s;e are partly the rea&s;ons why
affection was placed by nature in the
hearts of mothers; or they would never
be able to give them&s;elves up to the
care and waking pains needful to the
&s;upport of their children.</P>
<P>Since this care is needful to the life of
children, to neglect them is to murther
them; to give them up to be managed
by tho&s;e people, who have none of that
needful affection placed by nature, is
to neglect them in the highe&s;t degree;
nay, in &s;ome it goes farther, and is a
neglect in order to their being lo&s;t; &s;o
that it is even an intentional murther,
whether the child lives or dies.</P>
<P>All tho&s;e things repre&s;ented them|&s;elves
to my view, and that in the black|e&s;t
and mo&s;t frightful form; and as I
was very free with my governe&s;s, I re|pre&s;ented
to her the dark thoughts
which I had upon me about it, and
told her what di&s;tre&s;s I was in. She
<PB N="201" REF="209">
a&s;ked me if &s;he had not been care|ful,
and tender of me in my lying-in,
as if I had been her own child? &startq;And
my dear, do you think there are not
women, who value them&s;elves upon
their being as careful of children, as
their own mothers can be? Yes, yes,
fear it not; how were we nur&s;ed our&s;elves.
Are you &s;ure you was nur&s;ed by your
own mother.&endq;</P>
<P>She touched me to the quick, when
&s;he a&s;ked me if I was &s;ure that I was
nur&s;ed by my own mother. I trembled
at the very expre&s;&s;ion, and I looked at
her as if I had been frighted: but re|flecting
that it could not be po&s;&s;ible
for her to know any thing about me,
that di&s;order went off, and I began to
be ea&s;y.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, &s;he &s;aid, &startq;Come my dear,
I have found out a way how you &s;hall
be certain that your child &s;hall be u&s;ed
well, and yet the people that take care
of it &s;hall never know you, or who the
mother of the child is.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O madam, if you can do &s;o, you
will engage me to you for ever.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="210">
&startq;Well, are you willing to be at
&s;ome &s;mall expence, more than what
we u&s;ually give to the people we con|tract
with?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ay, madam, provided I may be
concealed.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;As to that, you &s;hall be &s;ecure;
for the nur&s;e &s;hall never &s;o much as dare
to enquire about you, nay, you may
pa&s;s for an intimate acquaintance of the
mother, who does not chu&s;e to appear,
by which means you may go and &s;ee it,
whenever you plea&s;e, without any &s;u&s;|picion.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, do you think, that when I
come to &s;ee my child, I &s;hall be able to
conceal my being the mother of it? do
you think that po&s;&s;ible?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, my dear, if you di&s;cover
it, the nur&s;e &s;hall be forbid to a&s;k any
que&s;tions about you, or to take any no|tice.&endq;</P>
<P>I was very well plea&s;ed with this, and the
next week the woman came from Hert|ford
who was to take the child entirely
for ten pounds. She was a likely woman,
a cottager's wife, very clean and neat,
and I approved of her much. I pre|tended,
<PB N="203" REF="211">
I was only an agent for the mo|ther
of the babe, who did not chu&s;e
to appear her&s;elf; but if &s;he did her
duty by it, and the infant thrived, I
promi&s;ed &s;he &s;hould receive a guinea a
quarter, to defray her expences of bring|ing
it to London, for me or any per|&s;on
I &s;hould appoint to &s;ee it; and with
a heavy heart, and many a tear, I let
her have my child, and away &s;he went
with it.</P>
<P>From my behaviour, &s;he certainly
knew I was the mother; but as my
care was over, which though it did not
&s;atisfy my mind, yet was the mo&s;t con|venient
for me, as my affairs then &s;tood,
of any that could be thought of at that
time, I was now determined to write to
my friend at the Bank; and the begin|ing
of July I &s;ent him a letter, that I
propo&s;ed to be in town &s;ome time in
Augu&s;t. He returned me an an&s;wer in
the mo&s;t plea&s;ing terms, and de&s;ired me
to let him have timely notice, and he
would come and meet me two days
journey. This puzzled me greatly:
once I was re&s;olved to take the &s;tage-coach
to We&s;t-Che&s;ter, on purpo&s;e only
<PB N="204" REF="212">
to have the &s;atisfaction of coming back,
that he might &s;ee me really come in
the &s;ame coach; for I had a jealous
thought, le&s;t he &s;hould think I was not
really in the country.</P>
<P>Having taken mea&s;ures for my jour|ney;
I took a place in the &s;tage-coach,
not to its full extent, but to a place
called Stone in Che&s;hire, where I not
only had no manner of bu&s;ine&s;s, but
not &s;o much as the lea&s;t acquaintance
with any per&s;on in the town or near it.
But I knew that with money in my
pocket I &s;hould be at home any where;
&s;o I lodged there two or three days,
until, watching my opportunity, I found
room in another coach, and took pa&s;|&s;age
back again for London, &s;ending a
letter to him, that I &s;hould be on the
Monday evening following at the Crown
Inn at Stony-Stratford, where the coach|man
told me he was to lodge. He al&s;o
acquainted me he had been hired to
carry &s;ome gentlemen and ladies to
We&s;t-Che&s;ter, who were going for Ire|land,
was now returning, and did not
tie him&s;elf up to exact times or places
<PB N="205" REF="213">
as the &s;tages do; however, the warn|ing,
which I gave my friend, was &s;o
&s;hort, he could not reach to Stony-Stratford
time enough to be with me
that night, but he met me at Brickill
the next morning, as we were ju&s;t com|ing
into the town.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s I was glad to &s;ee him, for
I thought my&s;elf di&s;appointed over
night, as I had gone &s;o far to contrive
my coming on purpo&s;e. He plea&s;ed me
doubly too by the figure he came in;
for he brought a very hand&s;ome coach
and four hor&s;es, with a &s;ervant to attend
him.</P>
<P>He took me out of the coach imme|diately,
and putting into the &s;ame inn
he &s;et up his own coach, and be&s;poke
a dinner. I a&s;ked him what he meant,
for I was for going on with the journey?
He &s;aid No; I had need of a little re&s;t
upon the road, and that was a very
good hou&s;e, though it was but a little
town; &s;o we went no farther that night.
I did not pre&s;s him much, for &s;ince he
had come &s;o far to meet me, and put
him&s;elf to &s;o much expence, it was
but rea&s;onable I &s;hould oblige him.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="214">
After dinner we walked to &s;ee the
town, the church, and to view the fields,
and our landlord was our guide. I ob|&s;erved
my friend enquired much about
the par&s;on, which made me conclude,
he certainly would propo&s;e to be mar|ried;
and though it was a &s;udden
thought, it followed, that in &s;hort, I
would not refu&s;e him; for to be plain,
I was in no condition now to &s;ay No, I
had no rea&s;on now to run any more &s;uch
hazards.</P>
<P>While the&s;e thoughts were in agita|tion,
I ob&s;erved my landlord took him
a&s;ide and whi&s;pered to him, though not
very &s;oftly, for &s;o much I over-heard,
&startq;Sir, if you &s;hall have occa&s;ion&mdash;&endq;
the re&s;t I could not hear.</P>
<P>I heard his an&s;wer, which was, &startq;Very
well, I believe I &s;hall.&endq;</P>
<P>We were no &s;ooner returned to the
inn, but he began with irre&s;i&s;table
words, &s;ince he had had the good for|tune
to meet me, it would be ha&s;tening
his felicity if I would put an end to the
matter there. &startq;What do you mean,&endq;
&s;ays I, colouring a little; &startq;what in an
inn! ble&s;s us, how can you talk &s;o!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="215">
&startq;O, very well,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;I came a
purpo&s;e to talk &s;o, and I will &s;hew you
that I did.&endq;</P>
<P>With that he pulls out a bundle of
papers.</P>
<P>&startq;You fright me,&endq; &s;aid I; &startq;what are
all the&s;e?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Do not be frighted, my dear,&endq; &s;aid
he, and ki&s;&s;ed me; this was the fir&s;t
time he had been &s;o free to call me &s;o.
Then he repeated it, &startq;do not be fright|ed,
you &s;hall &s;ee:&endq;</P>
<P>So he unrolls them, and takes out a
&s;mall &s;hagreen ca&s;e, and gives me a
very fine diamond ring. I made him a
curt&s;y, and accepted it. Then he takes
out another ring, &startq;And this, is for
another occa&s;ion;&endq; &s;o he puts that in his
pocket.</P>
<P>&startq;Well, but let me &s;ee it,&endq; &s;ays I.</P>
<P>&startq;Stay,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;fir&s;t look here.&endq;
Then he took up a paper, and read it,
and behold! it was a licence for us to
be married.</P>
<P>&startq;Why,&endq; &s;ays I, &startq;are you di&s;tracted?
you are fully &s;atisfied that I would com|ply,
and yield at fir&s;t word, or re&s;olve to
take no denial.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="216">
&startq;The la&s;t, my dear, is certainly the
ca&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But you may be mi&s;taken,&endq; &s;aid I.</P>
<P>&startq;No, no,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;how can you
think &s;o? I mu&s;t not be denied;&endq; and
with that he fell to ki&s;&s;ing me &s;o vio|lently,
I could not get rid of him.</P>
<P>There was a bed in the room, and
as we were walking, eager in di&s;cour&s;e,
at la&s;t he takes me in his arms, and
threw me upon it; and holding me fa&s;t,
courted me to con&s;ent with &s;uch repeat|ed
entreaties and arguments, prote&s;ting
his affection, and vowing he would not
let me go till I had promi&s;ed him, that
at la&s;t I &s;aid, &startq;Why, you re&s;olve not to
be denied indeed, I think.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, no, I won't be denied.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, well,&endq; and giving him a
&s;light ki&s;s, &startq;then you &s;hall not be de|nied,
pray let me get up;&endq; and he im|mediately
left me.</P>
<P>He was impatient for my coming out
of my chamber; but finding me long,
he went down &s;tairs, and, as I under|&s;tood
afterwards, talked with the land|lord
about the par&s;on. My landlord, an
<PB N="209" REF="217">
officious though a well-meaning fellow,
had &s;ent away for the neighbouring
clergyman; and when my friend began
to &s;peak of it, and talk of &s;ending for
him, &startq;Sir,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;the clergyman is
in the hou&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>When he came, he a&s;ked him if he
would venture to marry a couple of
&s;trangers who were both willing? He
replied, the landlord had &s;aid &s;ome|thing
to him of it; he hoped it was no
clande&s;tine bu&s;ine&s;s; he &s;eemed to be a
grave gentleman, and he &s;uppo&s;ed the
lady was not a girl, &s;o that the con&s;ent
of friends &s;hould be wanted. &startq;To put
you out of doubt, read this paper,&endq; and
out he pulls the licence.</P>
<P>&startq;I am &s;atisfied, &s;ir; where is the
lady.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You &s;hall &s;ee her pre&s;ently;&endq; and he
came up and acquainted me with it.</P>
<P>I replied, &startq;It is time enough in the
morning.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, my dear, he &s;eemed to &s;cru|ple
whether it was not &s;ome young girl
&s;tolen from her parents, and that made
him a&s;k to &s;ee you.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="218">
&startq;Well, well, &s;ir, do as you plea&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>So up he came, and a merry gentle|man
he was. He had been told, we
were to have met la&s;t night at Stony-Stratford,
but that he could not reach &s;o
far.</P>
<P>&startq;Well, every ill turn has &s;ome good in
it; the di&s;appointment, &s;ir, was your's,
and the good turn is mine, for if you
had met at Stony Stratford I had not had
the honour to marry you.&mdash;Landlord
have you a common-prayer|book?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Lord, &s;ir, what do you mean?
what to marry in an inn, and at night
too!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Madam, if you will have it be in
the church you &s;hall, but I a&s;&s;ure you
your marriage will be as firm here; we
are not tied by the canons to marry no
where but in the church; and if you
will have it there, it will be as publick
as a country wake; and as for the time
of day it matters not; princes are mar|ried
in their chambers, and at eight or
ten o'clock at night.&endq;</P>
<P>I was a great while before I could be
per&s;uaded, and pretended not to be wil|ling
<PB N="211" REF="219">
to be married but in a church; but
at la&s;t I con&s;ented, and the landlord,
his wife, and daughter were called up:
My landlord was father and clerk, and
when the ceremony of marriage was
over, very merry we were; though I
confe&s;s the &s;elf-reproaches which I had
upon me before, lay clo&s;e, and extorted
every now and then a deep &s;igh from
me, which my hu&s;band took notice
of, and endeavoured to encourage me,
thinking, that I had &s;ome little he|&s;itations
at the &s;tep I had taken &s;o
ha&s;tily.</P>
<P>The affair was managed &s;o private,
that not a &s;ervant in the hou&s;e knew of
it, for my landlady and her daughter
waited on me, and would not let any
of the maids come up &s;tairs, except
while we were at &s;upper. My land|lady's
daughter I called my bridemaid,
and &s;ending for a &s;hop-keeper the next
day, I gave the young woman &s;everal
ribbons, and finding it was a lace-making
town, I gave her mother a piece of lace
for a cap.</P>
<P>One rea&s;on that my landlord was &s;o
clo&s;e was, he was unwilling the mini&s;ter
<PB N="212" REF="220">
of the pari&s;h &s;hould hear of it; but for
all that &s;omebody heard of it, &s;o that
we had the bells &s;et a ringing the next
morning early, and the mu&s;ick, &s;uch as
the town would afford, under our win|dow.
But the landlord brazened it out,
that we were married before we came
thither, only that being his former
gue&s;ts, we would have our wedding|&s;upper
at his hou&s;e. In &s;hort having
been di&s;turbed by the bells in the morn|ing,
we were &s;o &s;leepy afterwards that
we lay in bed until almo&s;t twelve.</P>
<P>I begged my landlady, when I got
up, that we might not have any more
mu&s;ick, nor ringing of bells; and &s;he
managed it that we were very quiet.
But an unexpected circum&s;tance inter|rupted
all my mirth for &s;ome time. My
bed-chamber looked into the &s;treet&punc;
being alone, I had walked to the end
of the room, and it being a plea&s;ant
warm day, I had opened the window,
and was &s;tanding at it for &s;ome air,
when I &s;aw three gentlemen on hor&s;e|back
go into an inn ju&s;t oppo&s;ite.</P>
<P>It is not to be conceived what a ter|ror
I was in; for the &s;econd of the
<PB N="213" REF="221">
three, I knew to be Mr. Carrol my
Lanca&s;hire hu&s;band. I never was in
&s;uch a con&s;ternation in my life; I thought
I &s;hould have &s;unk into the ground,
my blood chilled in my veins, and I
trembled as if I had been in a cold fit
of an ague. There was no room to
que&s;tion the truth of it: I knew his
cloaths, I knew his hor&s;e, and I knew
his face.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;en&s;ible reflection I made
was, that my new hu&s;band was not by
to &s;ee my di&s;order. The gentlemen had
not been long in the hou&s;e but they
came to the window of their room. My
window at this time was &s;hut: How|ever,
I could not keep from looking
at them: there I &s;aw him again, heard
him call to one of the &s;ervants of the
hou&s;e, and received all the terrifying
confirmations of its being the &s;ame per|&s;on,
that were po&s;&s;ible to be had.</P>
<P>My next concern was to know, if I
could, what was his bu&s;ine&s;s there; but
that was impo&s;&s;ible. My imagination
had formed an idea, he had di&s;covered
me, and was come to upbraid me with
ingratitude and breach of honour. At
<PB N="214" REF="222">
la&s;t, to my great &s;atisfaction, I &s;aw them
all three go out and travel on We&s;t|ward;
had they gone towards London,
I &s;hould have been &s;till in a fright, le&s;t
I &s;hould meet him on the road, but
happily he went the contrary way.</P>
<P>We re&s;olved to be going the next
morning; but about &s;ix o'clock in the
evening we were alarmed with a great
uproar in the &s;treet, and what &s;hould it
be but a hue and cry after three high|waymen,
who had robbed two coaches
near Dun&s;table Hill, and notice had
been given, that they had been &s;een at
Brickill at &s;uch a hou&s;e, meaning the
hou&s;e where they had been.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e was immediately be&s;et and
&s;earched, and the crowd having gather|ed
about it, we had the news pre&s;ently.
I was heartily concerned now another
way. I immediately acquainted my
landlord that I could an&s;wer tho&s;e were
not the per&s;ons, for that I knew one of
them to be a very hone&s;t gentleman, and
of a good e&s;tate in Lanca&s;hire.</P>
<P>The con&s;table was immediately in|formed
of this, and came over to me
to be &s;atisfied. I a&s;&s;ured him, I &s;aw the
<PB N="215" REF="223">
three gentlemen as I was at the win|dow,
that I &s;aw them afterwards at the
windows of the room they dined in;
and afterwards take hor&s;e, and could
a&s;&s;ure him I knew one of them to be a
gentleman of a good e&s;tate, and an un|doubted
character in Lanca&s;hire.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;urance with which I delivered
this, gave the con&s;table &s;uch &s;atisfac|tion,
that he immediately &s;ounded a
retreat. What the truth of the matter
was I knew not, but certain it was that
the coaches were robbed at Dun&s;table
Hill; as to the three gentlemen, that
remains to be explained hereafter.</P>
<P>This alarm &s;topped us another day,
though my &s;pou&s;e was for travelling,
and told me, it was always &s;afe&s;t after
a robbery, for the thieves were &s;ure to
be gone when they had alarmed the
country: but I was afraid and unea&s;y;
and indeed principally, le&s;t Mr. Carrol
&s;hould be upon the road, and &s;hould
chance to &s;ee me.</P>
<P>Bating this circum&s;tance, I never
lived four plea&s;anter days together in
my life. I was a meer bride all this
while; and my new &s;pou&s;e &s;trove to
<PB N="216" REF="224">
make me entirely ea&s;y in every thing,
and we came away the fifth day. My
landlord, becau&s;e he &s;aw me unea&s;y,
mounted him&s;elf, his &s;on, and three
country fellows with fire-arms, and,
without telling us of it, followed the
coach, and would &s;ee us &s;afe into Dun|&s;table.</P>
<P>We got home to London that even|ing,
and there I took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a
hou&s;e well furni&s;hed, and a hu&s;band in
very good circum&s;tances; &s;o that I had
a pro&s;pect of a very happy life.</P>
<P>And, I lived with him in the ut|mo&s;t
tranquillity. He was a quiet &s;en|&s;ible
man, and in his bu&s;ine&s;s deligent
and ju&s;t. As I abhorred the levity and
extravagance of my former life, I cho&s;e
now to live retired, frugal, and within
our&s;elves. I kept no company, made no
vi&s;its; minded my family, and obliged
my hu&s;band; and this kind of life be|came
a plea&s;ure to me.</P>
<P>We lived in an uninterrupted cour&s;e
of ea&s;e and content for five years, when
a &s;udden blow, from an almo&s;t invi&s;ible
hand, bla&s;ted all my happine&s;s, and
turned me out into the world in a con|dition
<PB N="217" REF="225">
the rever&s;e of all that had been
before it.</P>
<P>My hu&s;band having tru&s;ted one of
his fellow clerks with a &s;um of money,
too much for our fortunes to bear the
lo&s;s of, the clerk failed, and the lo&s;s
fell heavy on my hu&s;band; yet it was
not &s;o great, but that if he had had
courage to have looked his misfortunes
in the face, his credit was &s;o good,
that, as I told him, he would ea&s;ily
recover it, for to &s;ink under trouble is
to double the weight.</P>
<P>It was in vain to &s;peak comfortly to
him: the wound had &s;unk too deep, it
was a &s;tab that touched the vitals: he
grew melancholy and di&s;con&s;olate, and
from thence lethargick, and died. I
had had two children by him, and I
was left in a di&s;mal di&s;con&s;olate &s;tate,
and in &s;everal things wor&s;e than ever:
Fir&s;t, I could have but little expec|tation
of receiving the addre&s;&s;es of
another: that agreeable part had de|clined
&s;ome time, and the ruins only ap|peared
of what I had been; and that
which was wor&s;e than all, I was the mo&s;t
dejected creature living. I that had en|couraged
<PB N="218" REF="226">
my hu&s;band and endeavoured
to &s;upport his &s;pirits under his trouble,
could not &s;upport my own; I wanted
that &s;pirit, which I told him was &s;o
nece&s;&s;ary to him for bearing the bur|then.</P>
<P>I lived two years in this di&s;mal condi|tion,
wa&s;ting that little I had, weeping
continually over my unhappy circum&s;tan|ces,
without the lea&s;t hope or pro&s;pect
of help from God or man. And now I
had cried &s;o long, and &s;o often that
my tears were exhau&s;ted, and I began
to be melancholy, for I grew poor a|pace;
I mean as to money, but as to
my cloaths, I made as good a figure in
per&s;on as ever.</P>
<P>For a little relief I left my hou&s;e
and took lodgings, and as I was re|ducing
my living I &s;old off mo&s;t of my
hou&s;hold goods and plate, &s;pending very
&s;paringly, and ekeing things out to the
utmo&s;t; but &s;till when I looked before
me, my heart would &s;ink at the inevita|ble
approach of mi&s;ery and want. O
let none read this without &s;eriou&s;ly re|flecting
on the circum&s;tances of a de&s;o|late
&s;tate: it will certainly make them
<PB N="219" REF="227">
think not of &s;paring what they have
only, but of looking up to Heaven for
&s;upport, and of the wi&s;e man's prayer:
&startq;Lord! give me not poverty le&s;t I
&s;teal.&endq;</P>
<P>In this di&s;tre&s;s of mind, walking by
Temple-Bar, I ob&s;erved an office for
the hiring of &s;ervants, and went in. I
had no &s;ooner entered the room, than
a gentleman of a grave deportment, ex|treamly
neat in his dre&s;s, began a di&s;|cour&s;e
with me of the utility of the
place, imagining, by my appearance, I
was come in que&s;t of a &s;ervant. I &s;oon
undeceived him, by acquainting him
my ca&s;e was the rever&s;e, and added,
&startq;though I had a &s;mall independence,
yet, if I could hear of a &s;ingle gentle|man,
advanced in years, who wanted a
hou&s;ekeeper to manage his dome&s;tic af|fairs,
I &s;hould have no objection to &s;uch
a confinement.&endq;</P>
<P>Here the gentleman &s;miled, and &s;aid,
&startq;Why advanced in years madam? You
are not old your&s;elf;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It is for that rea&s;on, &s;ir, I &s;hould
chu&s;e he &s;hould be advanced in years,
<PB N="220" REF="228">
that neither he or my&s;elf &s;hould be cen|&s;ured.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Pardon me, madam, you never was
more out in your opinion; no age is
free from cen&s;ure, e&s;pecially with &s;uch
a companion, for upon my word you are
a very agreeable woman.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You flatter me, &s;ir, though flattery
ought not to have the lea&s;t effect upon
either of us, at our time of life, I
crave your pardon, &s;ir, for this free|dom,&endq;
and was about to take my leave;
when he immediately replied, &startq;What
are you thoughts of me madam? could
you confine your&s;elf to &s;uch an old fel|low
as I am?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Are you &s;erious &s;ir, and do you ex|pect
as &s;erious an an&s;wer, after what
you have &s;aid concerning cen&s;ure.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, upon the word of a man of
honour, I am: &s;ay what you plea&s;e, I
promi&s;e it &s;hall not offend me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, then, &s;ir, with the &s;ame &s;in|cerity,
when hereafter you are acquainted
with my character, I promi&s;e to be faith|ful
to your commands, as a hou&s;ekeeper,
to the height of my abilities.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="229">
He then told me he came on pur|po&s;e
to provide him&s;elf, as I had offer|ed;
that he was a batchelor, kept a
&s;mall hou&s;e near Leice&s;ter Fields, with
only one maid-&s;ervant, and a man in
livery, and propo&s;ed taking me home
with him: which I objected to, and I
added, it would have a better appear|ance
for me to follow him, that it
might be thought by his &s;ervants I had
heard of his wanting a hou&s;e-keeper,
and that I came to enquire after the
place.</P>
<P>He approved of my caution, and bid
me follow him as &s;oon as I plea&s;ed: but
before I left him, I acquainted him
with my name, and, al&s;o where I lived,
which was near Charing Cro&s;s; whe|ther
he went to make an enquiry after
me, I could not be certain, but this I
am certain, I got to his hou&s;e before
him; and while I was &s;peaking to his
man, concerning his ma&s;ter, he came,
and pulling off his hat, a&s;ked me very
politely, who I would plea&s;e to &s;peak
with? and, de&s;ired me to walk in with
as great a &s;eeming &s;trangene&s;s, as if he
had never &s;een me before.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="230">
This behaviour took off all &s;u&s;pi|cion,
and, in the hearing of his &s;ervant,
I announced my errand, and in about a
quarter of an hour after, he ringing for
the maid; &startq;Su&s;an,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;&s;hew
Mrs. Bennet your hou&s;e,&endq; and attended
us him&s;elf with &s;uch plea&s;antry, and
good-humour, which I thought gave
me an earne&s;t of my future happine&s;s.</P>
<P>While we were above &s;tairs, he &s;aid
before the maid, &startq;When can you come
Mrs. Bennet?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;As &s;oon as you plea&s;e, &s;ir, after
Wedne&s;day.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, then I &s;hall expect you on
Thur&s;day.&endq; Pre&s;ently afterwards we
came down, and I took my leave.</P>
<P>On the Thur&s;day evening about eight
I went, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion as keeper of
the hou&s;e, and though there were only
him&s;elf and me, he had ordered Su&s;an to
provide a very genteel &s;upper. Where I
found him in conver&s;ation extreamly
lively, agreeable, and polite in his man|ners.</P>
<P>In a few days I was as free and ea&s;y,
as when I had been there a twelve-month,
for indeed he was of an en|gaging
<PB N="223" REF="231">
temper, and, what made it more
&s;o, he was plea&s;ed with my conduct.</P>
<P>His u&s;ual method was, after break|fa&s;t,
to go to a coffee-hou&s;e and read
the papers, and when the weather per|mitted
to walk in the Park, until about
two, then came home to dine, and he
&s;eldom went out afterwards.</P>
<P>He read much and was fond of
mu&s;ic: and one day, I not knowing he
was returned from his u&s;ual walk, he
heard both my voice and the harp&s;i|chord;
upon his entrance into the room,
he exclaimed, &startq;Ble&s;s me, Mrs Bennet,
I am quite enraptured; pray let me hear
you again.&endq; When I had fini&s;hed, he
took me from my &s;eat with thanks, and
&s;aluted me, which was the fir&s;t ki&s;s I
had ever received from him.</P>
<P>From this time, he frequently en|treated
me to oblige him, as he called
it, and I was &s;ure to meet with the &s;ame
reward, a &s;alute; though at any other
time he took not the lea&s;t freedom with
me.</P>
<P>This put me upon determining, the
fir&s;t opportunity I had, that I would
play without his entreaty, which had
<PB N="224" REF="232">
its effect; for he added a pre&s;&s;ure to
his &s;alute, by drawing me to him, and
ki&s;&s;ing me clo&s;ely with warmth and
eagerne&s;s; at the &s;ame time making an
apology for the freedom he had taken.
Thus, from the &s;mall incident of a &s;a|lute,
from one freedom to another, be|fore
a month was expired, he came to
me one night, while I was a&s;leep in my
bed; and to tell my fair reader a truth,
from the moment I received the fir&s;t ki&s;s,
I expected no le&s;s.</P>
<P>I mention this as a warning to all my
&s;ex, who have the lea&s;t regard for their
virtue, that whenever a ma&s;ter takes the
lea&s;t liberty with a &s;ervant, which he
would willingly have her conceal, with|out
great prudence and fortitude on her
&s;ide, that woman is &s;ure to be ruined,
as I had, long before, mo&s;t woefully
experienced.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent, with me the ca&s;e was
otherwi&s;e, it was what I &s;ecretly wi&s;hed
for; though I gave him not the lea&s;t
cau&s;e, from my behaviour, for him to
imagine I would &s;ubmit to it; yet, I
who was acquainted with the frailty of
the other &s;ex, as well as with the frailty of
<PB N="225" REF="233">
my own, knew from experience, when
he once deviated from the line of pru|dence,
with me his &s;ervant, that his
folly would ripen, and that I &s;hould reap
the benefit of it, as, indeed, I did,
both to his &s;atisfaction and my own.</P>
<P>He left me at day-break, for fear of
a di&s;covery; and while I was preparing
the breakfa&s;t things, he came to me, in
the parlour, with his u&s;ual ea&s;e and free|dom,
as if nothing had happened.</P>
<P>While we were at breakfa&s;t, I a&s;ked
him, &s;miling, &startq;How he came to take
the freedom of coming to me as he
did?&endq; and added, &startq;I hoped it did not
proceed from any levity in my own beha|viour.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Not in the lea&s;t, my dear Mrs.
Bennet, I acquit you entirely; the de&s;ign
was mine, and from the fir&s;t hour you
con&s;ented to live with me, though I
never had re&s;olution before &s;ufficient to
put my de&s;ign in practice; nor &s;hould I
have proceeded, as I have, &s;o far I
will allow you to be an acce&s;&s;ary, for
I &s;hould never have attempted it, if I
had not perceived, that by your tender|ne&s;s,
<PB N="226" REF="234">
and engaging behaviour, I was not
di&s;agreeable to you.</P>
<P>It cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed from what I
have &s;aid, throughout the whole of my
hi&s;tory, that I ever denied, or refu&s;ed
to gratify him in any of his de&s;ires, in
a ca&s;e wherein I found my intere&s;t &s;o
highly connected; e&s;pecially, when I
confe&s;s, I looked upon him in the light
of a hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Yet, as we were not children, pru|dence
dictated to us, e&s;pecially as to
him&s;elf, to be on our guard in our
amour, le&s;t it &s;hould be vi&s;ible to his
other &s;ervants; for by a detection, he
&s;aid, he &s;hould lo&s;e that character,
which he had &s;o long pre&s;erved in|violable;
and, he added, it would hurt
him more &s;en&s;ibly now in the opinion of
the world, than an affair of the like
kind, would have done in the height and
vigour of his youth.</P>
<P>Though his rea&s;ons were &s;o ju&s;t,
upon this topic, as, indeed, they were
upon every &s;ubject he di&s;cour&s;ed upon,
yet, I could have been better plea&s;ed
if he had thought le&s;s of it; for
<PB N="227" REF="235">
though I enjoyed his company as u&s;ual,
yet, from the late freedom he had taken,
it was natural, and, indeed, it was what
I expected, to receive a more frequent
repetition of his folly than I experi|enced.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding
what I have &s;aid, as
I was &s;en&s;ible he loved me, I could not
help but approving of his di&s;cretion;
for, he told me, as he had been ever
temperate, both with wine and women,
he was at this time, though &s;ixty, hear|ty
and hale, and, in my opinion, as
ever I knew a man of forty; as to my|&s;elf,
though, I was forty-&s;even, it was
&s;aid, by tho&s;e who knew me, I had as
much &s;pirit and vivacity, and was as
elegant in figure, and flattered my&s;elf
as de&s;irable, as I was when at the age of
thirty.</P>
<P>However, health, and inclination on
both &s;ides, &s;oon broke down the fences
which lay in his way; for, in &s;o &s;mall
a family as his, where the parties have
already agreed, there are opportunities
&s;ufficient to be found, in the twenty-four
hours, to &s;atisfy their pa&s;&s;ions
<PB N="228" REF="236">
for love, as well as their pa&s;&s;ions for
hatred.</P>
<P>The kind and agreeable u&s;age I re|ceived
from this gentleman, can only be
found in a mind replete with benevo|lence:
he &s;tudied to oblige me in all I
could de&s;ire, and we lived in the utmo&s;t
harmony, I loving, and being beloved,
without either Su&s;an or William &s;u&s;|pecting
us; when, unluckily, the maid,
being di&s;turbed one night by a noi&s;e of
fire, came running into my room to
acquaint me with it, when &s;he unfortu|nately
di&s;covered us both together in bed.</P>
<P>This, as &s;he afterwards &s;aid, employ|ed&punc;
her thoughts in a different manner,
for &s;he left the room in as great a
hurry, as when &s;he came into it; which
gave my ma&s;ter an opportunity to leave
me al&s;o, who retired to his own apart|ment:
as for the fire we heard no more
of it; but I being dre&s;t, and willing
to know what was became of Su&s;an, I
went up to the room, there was &s;he in
bed and William with her. I confe&s;s
I was plea&s;ed with this incident, and
while I was at breakfa&s;t with my ma&s;ter,
ob&s;erving him to look very pen&s;ive,
<PB N="229" REF="237">
and thinking to relieve him, I related
the affair of William and Su&s;an in the
garret.</P>
<P>After ruminating for &s;ome time, he
&s;aid, &startq;They &s;hall both go, for though
I have taken freedoms with you Mrs.
Bennet, yet, I will not countenance the
&s;ame in my &s;ervants, therefore they
&s;hall go immediately; accordingly he
ordered me to &s;end them up to him,
and without entering into any debate, he
paid them both their wages, and they
left the hou&s;e within an hour.</P>
<P>After they were gone, I told him I
had had a little conver&s;ation with the
girl before &s;he went. &startq;Harkee Su&s;an,&endq;
&s;ays I, &startq;It will be be&s;t for us both
to be &s;ilent; if you will not tattle about
my failings, with my ma&s;ter, I will
conceal yours, which you have had
with William.&endq;</P>
<P>Su&s;an replied, &startq;I am obliged to you,
Madam; and now if you plea&s;e, I will
relate this unfortunate affair. Curio&s;ity,
Madam, that bane to our &s;ex, prompt|ed
me to be a&s;&s;ured, for I had long
&s;u&s;pected it, of your having an intrigue
with my ma&s;ter; to accompli&s;h this, I
<PB N="230" REF="238">
pretended I heard a cry of fire; I &s;hould
have ob&s;erved, that before I came down to
you, I had made the &s;ame pretence to Wil|liam;
he watching the opportunity of my
return, I no &s;ooner got into my bed, but
he came there al&s;o, and he had not been
by me, I am &s;ure, ten minutes, before
you made the fatal di&s;covery.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Oh! Su&s;an, Su&s;an,&endq; &s;aid I, &startq;this
was not the fir&s;t time you had been
together, from your own &s;tory I know it,
for, if it had, you would, upon your
finding him in your bed with you, have
made as real an outcry, in defence of
your virtue, as you before did a feign|ed
one, on account of the fire. She
made not the lea&s;t reply to this, but
went up to her ma&s;ter, where &s;he was
di&s;charged, as has before been related.</P>
<P>This part concerning our&s;elves, I
concealed from my ma&s;ter at pre&s;ent,
knowing it would affect him, for he
dreaded the cen&s;ure of the world, and
could not bear the thought of being ex|po&s;ed,
though in infirmities peculiar to
human nature.</P>
<P>Here I cannot help remarking how
we are apt to deceive our&s;elves: it never
<PB N="231" REF="239">
entered into our thoughts that Su&s;an
&s;u&s;pected us, nay, we frequently flat|tered
each other concerning our pru|dence
in our amours; for we were not
like a boy and a girl, who are for
ever romping and toying together;
that was what deceived us; we did not
con&s;ider, there are other ways to cau&s;e
&s;u&s;picion, than meerly the freedom of
ki&s;&s;ing; the eye or the tongue at certain
periods, are as good interpreters, as
either the hand or the lips; this was
the ca&s;e with us. Su&s;an di&s;covered his
fondne&s;s to behold me, &s;he al&s;o di&s;co|vered
my de&s;ire to plea&s;e, or my con|cern
for his ab&s;ence, and uncommmon
joy for his return, expre&s;&s;ed, rather be|coming
the fondne&s;s of an indulgent
wife, than could be expected from the
be&s;t of &s;ervants. The&s;e, as &s;he after|wards
told me, gave ri&s;e to that &s;u&s;pi|cion,
as the reader has been &s;o fully ac|quainted
with.</P>
<P>But, to return: &s;trange it is to tell,
he, who took every opportunity before,
when he had &s;o many difficulties to &s;ur|mount,
now, by their ab&s;ence, they
were removed, did not attempt to reap
<PB N="232" REF="240">
the advantage, and we lay in &s;eparate
beds, for &s;everal nights, as if we had
been the mo&s;t virtuous male and fe|male
breathing.</P>
<P>One morning, at breakfa&s;t, contrary
to my expectation, he, with great af|fability,
enquired how I re&s;ted; with a
deal of good-nature, expatiated largely
on the amour of the girl, and &s;aid,
from what I had told him, he hoped
the affair would be buried in oblivion,
and taking me by the hand ki&s;&s;ed me
with fervency.</P>
<P>We were near a fortnight without
either, man or maid, to &s;upply their
places. I had a woman indeed to help
me in the day, but &s;he left us in the
evening, &s;o that we had the hou&s;e to
our&s;elves until the morning; what u&s;e
we now made of it, is not materially ne|ce&s;&s;ary
for the reader to be acquainted
with.</P>
<P>Here I lived to the extent of my
wi&s;hes; but an unhappy accident hap|pening,
as he rode out one morning for
an airing, his hor&s;e took fright, threw
him, and killed him upon the &s;pot;
and his nephew, who was his heir at
<PB N="233" REF="241">
law, coming into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and, I
being looked upon as an incumbrance,
was accordingly di&s;charged, and I re|turned
to my former lodgings.</P>
<P>I had not been here long, the wea|ther
being exceeding fine, I dre&s;&s;ed my|&s;elf
very genteely, with an intention to
dine with a lady of my acquaintance, a
linen draper's wife in Cornhill, whom I
had not &s;een for &s;everal years.</P>
<P>As I was going along Cheap&s;ide, I
was acco&s;ted by a gentleman, who, un|der
a pretence of knowing me, a&s;ked
me where I was walking to; and, in
my way thither, I informed him. When
we came to the hou&s;e, he civilly took
his leave; and I thought no more of
him.</P>
<P>In the evening after tea, as I was re|turning
to my lodging, who &s;hould I
&s;ee but the very &s;ame gentleman; it
was very lucky, he &s;aid, to have the
plea&s;ure of &s;eeing me twice in one day,
and was exceeding pre&s;&s;ing for me to
drink a gla&s;s of wine, which I refu&s;ed;
at la&s;t, &startq;Madam, will you plea&s;e to ac|cept
of a play?&endq; I complying, he
handed me into a coach, and ordered
<PB N="234" REF="242">
the man to drive to Drury-Lane Play|hou&s;e,
where we &s;at in a front box;
between the acts, he prevailed upon me
to con&s;ent to &s;up with him, and, when
the play was over, to a tavern we went
where he treated me very genteely.</P>
<P>It now began to grow late, or rather
early, for it was one o'clock, and I
took notice of it, and told him, he mu&s;t
excu&s;e me, I could not &s;tay any longer.
He was &s;en&s;ible it was late, he &s;aid, and
would &s;ee me home, which he accord|ingly
did to my door, and I heard him
afterwards order the coachman to drive
him to Soho-Square.</P>
<P>When I got into my room, I rumi|nated
what mu&s;t be his thoughts con|cerning
me, and, on the other hand,
he could not but wonder, at my thoughts
concerning him&s;elf; for though, in the
cour&s;e of the evening, he frequently
&s;aluted me, and was plea&s;ed to com|pliment
me, as to my per&s;on; yet, as
it is the province of hi&s;tory to relate
facts, I do a&s;&s;ure you, reader, to his
honour, however you may be di&s;ap|pointed,
he never attempted to offer the
<PB N="235" REF="243">
lea&s;t indecency, no more than if I had
been his own &s;i&s;ter, or any other near
relation.</P>
<P>It may be wondered, from what I
have &s;aid, why we were together &s;o
long; but that wonder will cea&s;e, when
I acquaint the reader, he was only de|&s;irous
to hear my &s;tory, which I willing|ly,
and readily, complied with; for
my trouble, as he was plea&s;ed to call it,
he made me a genteel pre&s;ent and at|tended
me home, as I have related.</P>
<P>I profe&s;s I could not devi&s;e the mean|ing
of his behaviour, though polite to
the highe&s;t degree; yet, as I had com|plied
with his reque&s;t, both in my
going to the play, and to the tavern to
&s;upper, it was natural for him to expect
I would not refu&s;e any liberties he
might offer; and to be candid with
you, I do acknowledge you have rea|&s;on
to think &s;o; yet, as I have &s;aid,
the&s;e liberties he did not take.</P>
<P>My not &s;eeing him for a week, I
concluded I &s;hould not &s;ee him again,
or, at lea&s;t, as he knew where I lived,
he did not intend to come to my lodg|ing;
but, in this I was al&s;o di&s;appointed;
<PB N="236" REF="244">
for before a fortnight was expired he
came, and &s;taid the evening with me.
Here I mu&s;t be excu&s;ed from relating
the particulars of this vi&s;it, and many
others which I afterwards received, in
all which he was ever very bountiful,
and a true friend he was, indeed, to me.</P>
<P>At the end of about &s;even months,
as I was walking alone one Sunday, in
Saint James's Park, to my &s;urpri&s;e I
met Mr. Carrol my hu&s;band; who, by
his endearments, I perceived was as re|joyed
to &s;ee me, as I was to &s;ee him; we
immediately left the Park, and retired to
my lodging.</P>
<P>Though I was rejoiced to find my
hu&s;band, I had a damp upon my &s;pirits
concerning my generous friend, le&s;t Mr.
Carrol &s;hould di&s;cover our intrigue,
which now I was determined to break
off; and what to do I knew not: in this
anxiety, I came to the re&s;olution to re|move,
under pretence the lodging was
not convenient for us both; to this my
hu&s;band complied with, and according|ly
in a few days, we went away.</P>
<P>This I managed &s;o &s;ecretly, that my
landlady knew not where we retired to;
<PB N="237" REF="245">
and though I never &s;u&s;pected her having
any &s;u&s;picion of my criminalty with my
friend, yet as &s;he knew I acknowledged
Mr. Carrol to be my hu&s;band, I na|turally
expected &s;he would acquaint the
gentleman, the next time he came, that
I had left her lodging, in the company
of my hu&s;band; which was contrary to
what I had related, for I pa&s;&s;ed with him
as a widow.</P>
<P>This, and the fear of my being di&s;|covered,
either by him or my hu&s;band,
gave me great unea&s;ine&s;s; and as I knew
he, as u&s;ual, would call, therefore, in a
few days, I paid her a vi&s;it, when &s;he
informed me he came on the Wedne&s;|day
evening, that &s;he told him my hu&s;|band
was returned from Ireland, and had
taken me to &s;ome other lodging, but,
where, &s;he could not inform him.</P>
<P>Though this account, which &s;he gave
me, ea&s;ed me of my fears, yet, as I
had received &s;uch noble and polite
u&s;age from him, I was mortified to
think he mu&s;t look upon me as a cheat,
in my pretending to be a widow, when
at the &s;ame time I was a wife; but, as I
never expected to &s;ee Mr. Carrol again,
<PB N="238" REF="246">
and as the reader is acquainted with the
death of my hu&s;band of the Bank, if
rightly con&s;idered, if he had known it,
I ought to pa&s;s for no other than a
widow; and, from that time to this, I
never &s;aw him more.</P>
<P>My hu&s;band was exceeding kind, and
behaved with a deal of tenderne&s;s to|wards
me, and pre&s;&s;ed me to acquaint
him how I had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in his ab&s;ence.
Not chu&s;ing he &s;hould know of my late
amour, I pretended I had received a
legacy of one hundred pounds, by the
death of an aunt, of which, he might
&s;ee, I was then in mourning, though,
in truth, it was for the death of my
hu&s;band of the Bank. He &s;eemed re|joiced
at what I had told him, and made
no farther enquiry.</P>
<P>He then let me into his own affairs,
and &s;aid, &startq;He had received a legacy
al&s;o, by the death of a very intimate ac|quaintance;&endq;
and indeed his appearance
was very genteel, with a bag-wig and
&s;word, with every thing &s;uitable. Thus,
we lived with the greate&s;t harmony, I
&s;eldom being &s;een abroad, for rea&s;ons
well known to the reader, and he was as
<PB N="239" REF="247">
con&s;tant at home, for rea&s;ons be&s;t known
to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erved Mr. Carrol appeared
very genteel, but how he maintained
me and him&s;elf, I was an entire &s;tranger
to, nor did I enquire, though I mu&s;t
confe&s;s the hue and cry after him at
Brickhill, as before mentioned, often
occurred to my mind, though I never
mentioned it to him; yet, I had a &s;u&s;|picion,
he took liberties on the road,
which if known, as I imagined, would
not have been to his credit; for he was
&s;ometimes out early in a morning,
though at home the re&s;t of the day,
however, as I &s;aid, this was only &s;u&s;pi|cion;
but time gave it proof, for in
le&s;s than &s;ix months, I received the fol|lowing
letter.</P>

</LETTER>
<PB N="240" REF="248">
<P>I no &s;ooner received this melancholy
epi&s;tle, than I ha&s;tened to his di&s;mal
abode, where I found him fettered with
irons; and que&s;tioning him the rea&s;on of
his misfortues, he replied, &startq;Do not be a|alarmed
my love, I am only here upon a
&s;u&s;picion of a robbery, &s;aid to be commit|ted
ye&s;terday morning upon Houn&s;low-Heath;
it &s;eems as a lady was riding in
her chariot, a man on hor&s;eback, came
and demanded her money, watches and
rings; and took from her three guineas
and a &s;ilk pur&s;e; this man, they &s;ay,
was very like me, and mounted on a
hor&s;e very like mine, and before I got
to Smallbury Green, I was &s;eized by
two or three men, carried before a ma|gi&s;trate
at Brentford, and he committed
me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Oh! my dear, you have &s;aid
enough,&endq; and I fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the
floor. When I recovered, I was de&s;ired
by the keeper of the man&s;ion to de|part,
and I came away in the utmo&s;t
horror of mind that can be conceived.</P>
<P>I &s;aw him every day, and all the day;
and this being the long vacation, when
<PB N="241" REF="249">
the judges were on their circuits, I ob|&s;erved
I was taken particular notice of by
&s;everal of the female pri&s;oners, and I
wondered at the meaning of it. At
length my hu&s;band told me, I was
known in the place, and they &s;aid my
name was Mary Flanders, or, they ra|ther
rudely, and vulgarly, called me
Moll Flanders.</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ured him, which was a truth,
that I never was within the place, be|fore
I came to &s;ee him, to the be&s;t of
my knowledge; and therefore they mu&s;t
be mi&s;taken, in taking me for &s;ome other
per&s;on.</P>
<P>Bad as I had been, and whatever
they might know of me, I had never
been there as a felon, though my mo|ther
had; therefore I concluded they
mu&s;t be acquainted with &s;ome of my
intrigues. As to my taking upon me the
name of Flanders, it was, as I have
before &s;aid, to avoid a pro&s;ecution for
concealing my former hu&s;band's effects:
be&s;ides, the per&s;ons who pretended all
this, were entire &s;trangers to me; there|fore
I imagined they took me for &s;ome
<PB N="242" REF="250">
other woman, who might, like my&s;elf,
have a&s;&s;umed the name<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Upon enquiry I found there had been a wo|man in Newgate, who was extremely like me in her per&s;on; but &s;he was not only well known to be a woman of the town, but &s;he was as notori|ou&s;ly known to be a thief; and, for the latter, &s;he was at this pre&s;ent time abroad under her &s;entence of tran&s;portation.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>However, at length, the time for his
trial come on, and being arraigned, he
pleaded, not guilty; and neither the
lady or her &s;ervant being po&s;itive to
the identity of his per&s;on, al&s;o being
doubtful concerning her pur&s;e, with
other circum&s;tances in his favour, he
was acquitted; but being detained upon
a &s;econd indictment, for taking a tor|toi&s;e&s;hel
&s;nuff-box, rimmed with gold,
from a &s;ilver-&s;mith in the Strand, he
was found guilty to the value of thirty-nine
&s;hillings, for which he received
&s;entence for tran&s;portation for &s;even
years.</P>
<P>The hearing this &s;entence pronounced,
gave me but little affliction; for as I
intended to be a &s;harer in his di&s;tre&s;s,
<PB N="243" REF="251">
I was re&s;olved to accompany him; and
we &s;oon learned it was very ea&s;y for him
to prevail upon the captain of the &s;hip,
where there was money, to buy him&s;elf
off when he came to Virginia.</P>
<P>The reader may remember I had
formerly told him, when we were at
Dun&s;table, the advantages we might
reap by our going to Virginia, and that
I had a mother living there at that
time; but as it was &s;everal years &s;ince I
had heard from her, I imagined &s;he mu&s;t
now be dead; yet I hoped to partake
of part of her effects, as &s;he &s;aid, when
I left her there, I might depend upon
her remembrance of me; and I told
him I had many views in going there,
as well upon my own account, as his;
for I could ea&s;ily in&s;truct him how to
manage him&s;elf, &s;o as never to be a
&s;ervant, as he was not de&s;titute of money,
which is a very nece&s;&s;ary friend in &s;uch
a condition.</P>
<P>He &s;miled, and &s;aid, he did not tell
me he had money. I told him I hoped
he did not under&s;tand, that I &s;hould ex|pect
any &s;upply from him if he had:
though I had not a great deal, yet I did
<PB N="244" REF="252">
not want, and while I had any I would
rather add to him, than weaken him in
that article, &s;eeing, whatever he had, I
knew, in his ca&s;e, he would have occa|&s;ion
for it.</P>
<P>He expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in a mo&s;t tender
manner. He told me, what money he
had was not a great deal, that he would
never conceal any of it if I wanted it;
and he a&s;&s;ured me he did not &s;peak with
any &s;uch apprehen&s;ions; that he was
only intent upon what I had hinted to
him before he went: that here he
knew what to do with him&s;elf, but
there he &s;hould be the mo&s;t helple&s;s
wretch alive.</P>
<P>I told him he terrified him&s;elf with
that which had no terror in it: that as
he had money, he might not only avoid
the &s;ervitude, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the con&s;e|quence
of tran&s;portation, but begin the
world upon a new foundation; that he
could not but call to mind, it was what
I had recommended to him many years
before, and had propo&s;ed it for our
mutual &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and re&s;toring our
fortunes in the world; and I would tell
him now, that to convince him both
<PB N="245" REF="253">
of the certainty of it, and of my being
fully acquainted with the method, and
al&s;o fully &s;atisfied in the probability of
&s;ucce&s;s, that I would go with him freely,
and of my own choice, and perhaps
carry enough with me to &s;atisfy him
that I did not offer it for want of being
able to live without a&s;&s;i&s;tance from him,
but that I thought his misfortunes had
been &s;uch, as were &s;ufficient to recon|cile
him to quitting this part of the
world, and living where no-body could
upbraid him with what was pa&s;t; and
where he &s;hould look back on all his
di&s;a&s;ters with infinite &s;atisfaction, when
he &s;hould con&s;ider that his enemies
&s;hould entirely forget him, and that he
&s;hould live as a new man in a new
world, no-body having any thing to &s;ay
to him, or he to them.</P>
<P>I pre&s;&s;ed this home to him with &s;o
many arguments, and an&s;wered his ob|jections
&s;o effectually, that he embraced
me, and told me, I treated him with
&s;uch a &s;incerity and affection as over|came
him; that he would take my ad|vice,
and would &s;trive to &s;ubmit to his
fate, in hope of having the comfort of
<PB N="246" REF="254">
my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, of &s;o faithful a coun|&s;ellor,
and &s;uch a companion in his
mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>My hu&s;band took it kindly of me,
in my offer of attending him in his voy|age
to Virginia; and I not only pro|vided
materials proper to be u&s;ed when
we came there, but I waited on the
captain of the &s;hip who was to take
him, and with whom I agreed to go as
a pa&s;&s;enger, letting him know I was
wife to Mr. James Carrol, one he was
appointed by the government to con|vey
to Virginia, and begged him to fa|vour
him as far as it was con&s;i&s;tent with
his duty, for which I would pay him
any rea&s;onable gratuity.</P>
<P>He very bluntly an&s;wered me, &startq;Why,
look you madam, I have no power on
&s;hore, but, when I have him on board,
I can do as I plea&s;e, and no one can call
me to account.&endq;</P>
<P>I replied, mildly, &startq;Sir, I am not
di&s;puting your power, I am &s;oliciting
your clemency for an unfortunate gen|tleman,
as I am &s;ure you will think &s;o
when you conver&s;e with him.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="255">
&startq;As for matter of that, madam, I
and my father, have had pretty large
dealings with the unfortunate for the&s;e
fifty years pa&s;t; but, as you was &s;aying
he is a gentleman, you mu&s;t apply to
tho&s;e who have him now in their cu&s;|tody,
that he may be brought on board
privately, unknown to the others under
the &s;ame predicament, and when I have
him under my in&s;pection, as I &s;aid be|fore,
I can behave to him agreeable to
your inclinations.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I am highly obliged to you, &s;ir,
for your advice, and, as you &s;eem to
commi&s;erate my ca&s;e, you will add
greatly to the opinion I have already
entertained of your humanity towards
the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, if you will be plea&s;ed to
&s;peak to tho&s;e your&s;elf, whom you have
advi&s;ed me to apply to, for I would
not chu&s;e that even the &s;hip's crew,
&s;hould be acquainted with my hu&s;band's
di&s;a&s;ter; and my further application is,
that he may be looked upon in the &s;ame
light as my&s;elf, as a pa&s;&s;enger at large,
for which I promi&s;e to pay you thirty
guineas for our voyage.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="256">
With his u&s;ual bluntne&s;s, he replied,
&startq;Say no more, madam; it &s;hall be
done.&endq;</P>
<P>Accordingly I &s;ent our uten&s;ils for
the cultivation of the land, al&s;o our
cloaths and other nece&s;&s;aries, which co&s;t
us above one hundred and fifty pounds;
and when the time came for him to &s;et
&s;ail, the captain took my hu&s;band on
board with him, as if he had been his
intimate friend.</P>
<P>When we got to Grave&s;end, the cap|tain
offered my hu&s;band a civility, which
he had no rea&s;on to expect; namely,
to let him go on &s;hore, upon giving
his word that he would return on board
again.</P>
<P>Accordingly we both went on &s;hore
with the captain, &s;upped together in
Grave&s;end, and came back with him in
the morning: Here we bought ten do|zen
of beer, wine and fowls, to accom|modate
us in our pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>We had a fair ea&s;terly wind &s;prung
up the third day after we came to the
Downs, and we &s;ailed from thence the
tenth of April; nor did we touch any
more at any place, until being driven
<PB N="249" REF="257">
on the coa&s;t of Ireland by a very hard
gale of wind, the &s;hip came to an an|chor
in a little Bay, near the mouth of
a river which they &s;aid came down
from Limerick, and was the large&s;t river
in Ireland.</P>
<P>Being detained by bad weather, the
captain took us on &s;hore with him
again: He did it in kindne&s;s to my
hu&s;band, who bore the &s;ea very ill,
and was very &s;ick, e&s;pecially when it
blew hard. Here we again bought &s;tore
of fre&s;h provi&s;ions; when the weather
turning mild, and a fair wind, we &s;et
&s;ail again, and in two and forty days
came &s;afe to the coa&s;t of Virginia.</P>
<P>When we drew near to the &s;hore, I
addre&s;&s;ed the captain in favour of my
hu&s;band, and begged he would be &s;o
kind, as he was plea&s;ed to promi&s;e him
he would.</P>
<P>He replied, &startq;Mrs. Carrol, you mu&s;t
get &s;omebody to come and buy your
hu&s;band as a &s;ervant, and who mu&s;t an|&s;wer
for him to the governor of the
country if he is demanded. I returned
him thanks, and &s;aid I would leave it
<PB N="250" REF="258">
entirely to his management. Accordingly
he brought a planter to treat with him
for the purcha&s;e, and my hu&s;band was
&s;old to him in form, and went on &s;hore
with him. After &s;ome time the planter
gave Mr. Carrol a certificate of his di&s;|charge,
and an acknowledgement of his
having &s;erved him faithfully; and he
was free from him the next morning, to
go whither he would.</P>
<P>For this &s;ervice the captain demanded
of him &s;ix thou&s;and weight of tobacco,
which he &s;aid he was accountable for
to his freighter, and which he imme|diately
bought for him, and I paid him
the thirty guineas be&s;ides, with which
he was abundantly &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>It is immaterial to enter here into the
particulars of what part of the colony
of Virginia we &s;ettled in, for many rea|&s;ons:
it may &s;uffice to mention, we
went into the great river of Potomack,
the &s;hip being bound thither; and there
we intended to have &s;ettled, though
afterwards we altered our minds.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing I did of moment,
after having got all our goods on &s;hore,
<PB N="251" REF="259">
was to enquire after my mother and
brother, that fatal per&s;on who I mar|ried,
as I have related at large. A little
enquiry furni&s;hed me with information,
that my mother, was dead; and that
my brother was alive, which I confe&s;s
I was &s;orry to hear; but which was
wor&s;e, he was removed from the planta|tion
where he lived formerly, and where
I lived with him, and was with his &s;on
in a plantation ju&s;t by the place where
we landed, and were we had hired a
warehou&s;e.</P>
<P>I was &s;urprized at fir&s;t: but as I ven|tured
to &s;atisfy my&s;elf that he could
not know me, I was not only ea&s;y, but
had a mind to &s;ee him, if it was po&s;&s;i|ble,
without his &s;eeing me. By inquiry,
I found out the plantation where he
lived, and with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a wo|man,
who I got to help me, I came &s;o
near that I &s;aw the dwelling-hou&s;e. I
a&s;ked the woman who&s;e plantation that
was: &s;he &s;aid, it belonged to one Mr.
Bennet; and looking out a little to our
right, there, &s;ays &s;he, is the gentleman
that owns the plantation, and his father
with him.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="260">
&startq;What are their chri&s;tian names?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I know not what the old gentle|man's
name is, but his &s;on's name is,
Humphry, and I believe the father's is
&s;o too.&endq;</P>
<P>You may gue&s;s what a confu&s;ed
mixture of joy and fright po&s;&s;e&s;t my
thoughts upon this occa&s;ion; for I im|mediately
knew that this was my own
&s;on, by that father &s;he &s;hewed me, who
was my own brother.</P>
<P>As they drew near to us, I &s;aid,
&startq;Does he know you, Mrs. Owen?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, if he hears me &s;peak, he will
know me; but he can't &s;ee well enough
to know me or any-body el&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>This made me &s;ecure, and I let them
pa&s;s by me. It was a wretched thing
for a mother thus to &s;ee her own &s;on, a
hand&s;ome young gentleman in affluent
circum&s;tances, and dur&s;t not make her|&s;elf
known to him. Let any mother,
who reads this, con&s;ider, and think
with what angui&s;h of mind I re&s;train|ed
my&s;elf; what yearnings of &s;oul I
had in me to embrace him, and weep
over him: then &s;itting down on the
gra&s;s, I made as if I lay down to re&s;t
<PB N="253" REF="261">
me, but turned from her and lying on my
face, wept, and ki&s;&s;ed the ground that
he had &s;et his foot on.</P>
<P>As I was going back again, a new
occa&s;ion of melancholy offered it&s;elf:
the woman began, as if &s;he would tell
me a &s;tory to divert me. &startq;There goes a
&s;trange tale among the neighbours where
he formerly lived: The old gentleman
going to England, when he was a young
man, fell in love with a beautiful lady
there, and married her, and brought
her over hither to his mother, who was
then living. She lived here &s;ome years,
and had &s;everal children by him, of
which the young gentleman that was
with him now, was one; but after &s;ome
time, the old gentlewoman, his mother,
talking to her of &s;omething relating to
her&s;elf when &s;he was in England, the
daughter-in-law began to be very un|ea&s;y,
and in &s;hort, it appeared, that
&s;he was her mother, and con&s;equently,
that &s;on was his wife's brother, which
&s;he had had, by old Mr. Bennet, her
&s;econd hu&s;band: this &s;truck the whole
family with horror, and put them into
&s;uch confu&s;ion, that the young lady
<PB N="254" REF="262">
would not live with him, and &s;he, at
la&s;t, went away for England and has
never been heard of &s;ince:&endq; &s;he added,
&s;he had left a &s;um of money, and had
tied her plantation for the payment of
it, to be made good to the daughter, if
ever &s;he could be heard of, and that
the tru&s;t was left with this &s;on, who
was the per&s;on that we &s;aw with his
father.</P>
<P>This was news too good for me to
make light of, and filled my heart
with a thou&s;and thoughts, what cour&s;e
I &s;hould take: Here was a perplexity I
had not &s;kill to manage my&s;elf; it lay
heavy upon my mind night and day,
&s;o that Mr. Carrol perceived it, and
pre&s;&s;ed me to tell him what it was trou|bled
me. I told him I was troubled be|cau&s;e
we mu&s;t alter our &s;cheme of &s;et|tling,
for that I found I &s;hould be
known, if I &s;taid in that part of the
country, for that my mother being dead,
&s;everal of my relations were come into
that part where we then were, and that
I mu&s;t either di&s;cover my&s;elf to them,
which in his pre&s;ent circum&s;tances was
<PB N="255" REF="263">
not proper, or remove, and which to do
I knew not, and this it was that made
me &s;o melancholly.</P>
<P>He joined with me, that it was by
no means proper to make my&s;elf known
to any-body in his circum&s;tances; and,
therefore, he &s;aid, he would be willing
to remove to any other part of the
country, or even to any other country
if I thought fit. But now I had ano|ther
difficulty: if I removed to any other
colony, I put my&s;elf out of the way of
making a &s;earch after tho&s;e effects
which my mother had left. Again, I
could never think of breaking the &s;ecret
of my former marriage to Mr. Carrol;
it was not a &s;tory that would bear re|lating,
nor could I tell what might be
the con&s;equences of it. In this per|plexity
I continued, and this made Mr.
Carrol unea&s;y; for he thought I was
not open with him, and he would often
&s;ay he wondered what he had done,
that I would not tru&s;t him with what|ever
it was. The truth is, he ought to
have been tru&s;ted, for no man could de|&s;erve
better of a wife; but this was a
<PB N="256" REF="264">
thing I knew not how to open to him,
and yet having nobody to di&s;clo&s;e it
to, the burthen was too heavy upon my
mind. A &s;ecret of moment &s;hould al|ways
have a confident, a bo&s;om-friend,
to whom we may communicate the joy
of it, or the grief of it, be it which it
will, or it will be a double weight upon
the &s;pirits, and perhaps become even
in&s;upportable in it&s;elf; and this I ap|peal
to all human te&s;timony for the
truth of.</P>
<P>And this is the cau&s;e why many times
men, as well as women, and men of
the greate&s;t and be&s;t qualities other|ways,
yet have found them&s;elves weak
in this part, and have not been able to
bear the weight of a &s;ecret joy; but
have been obliged to di&s;clo&s;e it, even
for the meer giving vent to them&s;elves,
and to unbend the mind, oppre&s;t with
the loads and weights which attended
it; nor was this any token of folly, or
thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s, but a natural con&s;e|quence;
and &s;uch people, had they
&s;truggled longer with the oppre&s;&s;ion,
might have told it in their &s;leep, and
di&s;clo&s;ed the &s;ecret, let it have been of
<PB N="257" REF="265">
what nature &s;oever, without regard to
the per&s;on to whom it might be ex|po&s;ed.
This nece&s;&s;ity of nature is a
thing which works &s;ometimes with &s;uch
vehemence, in the minds of tho&s;e who
are guilty of any atrocious villainy,
&s;uch as &s;ecret murder in particularly,
that they have been obliged to di&s;cover
it, though the con&s;equence would ne|ce&s;&s;arily
be their own de&s;truction. Now,
though it may be true that the divine
ju&s;tice ought to have all the glory of
all tho&s;e di&s;coveries and confe&s;&s;ions, yet
it is as certain that providence, which
ordinarily works by the hands of na|ture,
makes u&s;e here of the &s;ame na|tural
cau&s;es to produce tho&s;e extraordi|nary
effects.</P>
<P>As the publi&s;hing this account of my
life, is for the &s;ake of the ju&s;t moral of
every part of it, and for in&s;truction,
caution, warning and improvement, to
every reader, &s;o this will not pa&s;s, I
hope, for an unnece&s;&s;ary digre&s;&s;ion con|cerning
&s;ome, who have di&s;clo&s;ed the
greate&s;t &s;ecrets either of their own, or
other peoples affairs.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="266">
Under the certain oppre&s;&s;ion of this
weight upon my mind, I laboured in the
ca&s;e I have been naming; and the only
relief I found for it, was to let my
hu&s;band into &s;o much of it, as I thought
would convince him of the nece&s;&s;ity
there was for us to think of &s;ettling
in &s;ome other place, and the next con|&s;ideration
before us, was, which part
of the Engli&s;h &s;ettlements we &s;hould go
to.</P>
<P>With this re&s;olution, I propo&s;ed to
him our going away from where we
were, and carrying our effects with us to
Carolina; and my hu&s;band readily a|greed,
that it was not proper to &s;tay,
&s;ince I had a&s;&s;ured him I &s;hould be
known: and the re&s;t I effectually con|cealed.</P>
<P>But now I found a new difficulty:
The main affair grew heavy upon my
mind &s;till, and I could not think of
going out of the country without mak|ing
enquiry into what my mother had
done for me; nor could I bear the
thought of going away, and not make
my&s;elf known to my child, only I
would have had this done without Mr.
<PB N="259" REF="267">
Carrol having any knowledge of it, or
they any knowledge that I had a hu&s;|band.</P>
<P>I had innumerable ways in my
thoughts how this might be done: I
would gladly have &s;ent my hu&s;band a|way
to Carolina, with all our goods,
and have come after my&s;elf. But this
was impracticable, he would never &s;tir
without me, being him&s;elf unacquainted
with the country, and with the methods
of &s;ettling there, or any where el&s;e.
Then I thought we would both go fir&s;t
with part of our goods, and that when
we were &s;ettled I &s;hould come back to
Virginia, and fetch the remainder; but
even then I knew he would never part
with me, and be left there alone.</P>
<P>The&s;e were therefore difficulties un|&s;urmountable,
and &s;uch as I knew not
what to do in. I had &s;uch &s;trong impre&s;|&s;ions
on my mind about di&s;covering
my&s;elf to Mr. Bennet, that I could not
with&s;tand them; and the rather, be|cau&s;e
if I did not do it, while he lived,
I might in vain endeavour to convince
my &s;on afterwards that I was his mo|ther,
and &s;o might both lo&s;e the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
<PB N="260" REF="268">
and comfort of the relation, and
the benefit of whatever it was my mo|ther
had left me; and yet on the other
hand, I could never think it proper to
di&s;cover to either of them that I had
a hu&s;band with me; on which account
it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to remove
from the place where I was, and come
again, as from another place, and in a|nother
figure.</P>
<P>Upon tho&s;e con&s;iderations, I went on
with telling my hu&s;band the ab&s;olute
nece&s;&s;ity there was of our not &s;ettling
in Potomack river, at lea&s;t that we
&s;hould be pre&s;ently made publick there,
whereas, if he went to any other place,
we &s;hould come in with as much repu|tation
as any family that came to
plant: That as it was always agreeable
to the inhabitants to have families come
among them, who brought &s;ub&s;tance,
either to purcha&s;e plantations, or begin
new ones; &s;o we &s;hould be &s;ure of a
kind reception, and without any po&s;&s;i|bility
of a di&s;covery.</P>
<P>I told him too, as I had &s;everal rela|tions
in the place where we were, that
I dur&s;t not now let my&s;elf be known
<PB N="261" REF="269">
to them, becau&s;e they would &s;oon come
into a knowledge of him, which would
be to expo&s;e my&s;elf to the la&s;t degree;
&s;o I had rea&s;on to believe that my mo|ther
who died here had left me &s;ome|thing,
and perhaps con&s;iderable, which
it might be well worth my while to en|quire
after; but this could not be done
without expo&s;ing us publickly, unle&s;s
we went from hence; and then wherever
we &s;ettled, I might come as it were to
vi&s;it and to &s;ee my brother and nephew,
make my&s;elf known to them, claim and
enquire after what was my due, be re|ceived
with re&s;pect, and at the &s;ame
time have ju&s;tice done me with chear|fulne&s;s;
whereas if I did it now, I
could expect nothing but with trouble,
&s;uch as exacting it by force, receiving
it with cur&s;es and reluctance, and with
all kinds of affronts, which he would
not perhaps bear to &s;ee; that in ca&s;e of
being obliged to legal proofs of being
really her daughter, I might be at a lo&s;s,
be obliged to have recour&s;e to England,
and it may be to fail at la&s;t, and &s;o lo&s;e
it, whatever it might be. With the&s;e
arguments, and having thus acquainted
<PB N="262" REF="270">
my hu&s;band with the &s;ecret &s;o far as
was needful to him, we re&s;olved to go
and &s;eek a &s;ettlement in &s;ome other colo|ny,
and at fir&s;t, Carolina was the place
we pitched upon.</P>
<P>In order to this, we made enquiry
for ve&s;&s;els going to Carolina, and in a
very little while got information, that
on the other &s;ide the Bay, in Maryland,
there was a &s;hip which came from Ca|rolina
loaden with rice, and was going
back again thither, and from thence to
Jamaica. On this news we hired a &s;loop
to take in our goods, and, taking a final
leave of Potomack river we went with
all our cargo over to Maryland.</P>
<P>This was a long, an unplea&s;ant, and
a dangerous voyage, con&s;iderably wor&s;e
than our voyage from England; the
very thought of it now &s;trikes me with
horror, even though the danger is pa&s;t.</P>
<P>However, thanks be to God, we got
&s;afe: and behold, when we came thither,
the &s;hip bound to Carolina was loaded
and gone three days before. This was
a di&s;appointment: but I, that was to be
di&s;couraged with nothing, told my hu&s;|band
that &s;ince we could not get a pa&s;|&s;age
<PB N="263" REF="271">
to Carolina, and as the country we
were in was very fertile, we would, if
he liked it, &s;ettle here.</P>
<P>We immediately went on &s;hore, but
found no conveniences; but were di|rected
by an hone&s;t Quaker, who we
found there, to go to a place about
&s;ixty miles ea&s;t; where he &s;aid he lived,
and where we &s;hould be accommodated,
either to plant, or to wait for any other
place to plant in that might be more
convenient: and he invited us with &s;o
much kindne&s;s, that we agreed to go,
and the Quaker him&s;elf went with us.</P>
<P>Here we bought us an Engli&s;h wo|man-&s;ervant
ju&s;t come on &s;hore from a
&s;hip of Leverpool, and a negro man|&s;ervant;
both ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for
all people who &s;ettle in that country.
This hone&s;t Quaker was very helpful to
us, and when we came to the place he
propo&s;ed, found us out a convenient
&s;tore-hou&s;e for our goods, and lodging
for our&s;elves and &s;ervants; and, in
about two months, we took up a large
piece of land from the governor of that
country, in order to form our planta|tion:
<PB N="264" REF="272">
&s;o we laid the thoughts of going
to Carolina a&s;ide, having been well re|ceived,
and accommodated with a con|venient
lodging, until we could have
land enough cured, and timber and
materials provided for building us a
hou&s;e, all which we managed by the
direction of the Quaker; &s;o that in one
year we had near fifty acres of land
cleared, part of it enclo&s;ed, and &s;ome
of it planted with tobacco; be&s;ides, we
had garden-ground and corn &s;ufficient
to &s;upply us with roots, herbs and
bread.</P>
<P>And now I per&s;uaded my hu&s;band to
let me go, and enquire after my friends.
He was the willinger to con&s;ent to it
now, becau&s;e he had bu&s;ine&s;s upon his
hands &s;ufficient to employ him, be&s;ides
his gun to divert him, and which he
greatly delighted in. Accordingly I
went to the plantation where my bro|ther
lived, and was fully re&s;olved to
tell him who I was; but not knowing
what temper I might find him in, or
how much out of temper, rather, I
might make him by &s;uch a ra&s;h vi&s;it, I
<PB N="265" REF="273">
wrote to him, to let him know that I
was come not to give him any trouble
about our former affair, which I hoped
was entirely forgot; but that I applied
to him as a &s;i&s;ter to a brother, de&s;iring
his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the ca&s;e of that provi|&s;ion,
which our mother, at her decea&s;e,
had left for my &s;upport, and which
I did not doubt but he would do me
ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>I &s;aid &s;ome very tender things in the
letter about his &s;on, which I told him
he knew to be my own child, &s;o I
hoped he would allow me the mo&s;t pa&s;|&s;ionate
de&s;ire of once &s;eeing my one
and only child, and of &s;hewing &s;ome|thing
of the infirmities of a mother in
pre&s;erving a violent affection for him,
who had never been able to retain any
thought of me one way or other.</P>
<P>I did imagine that when he received
my letter, he would give it to his &s;on
to read; but it fell out better: for as
his &s;ight was dim, he had allowed his
&s;on to open all letters that came to his
hand for him, and he being from home,
my letter came directly to my &s;on's
hand, and he opened and read it.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="274">
He called the me&s;&s;enger in, and a&s;ked
him where the per&s;on was who gave
him the letter. The me&s;&s;enger told him
the place; &s;o he bid him &s;tay, and or|de$ing
a hor&s;e to be got ready, and two
&s;ervants to attend him, away he came to
me with the me&s;&s;enger. Let any one
judge the con&s;ternation I was in, when
my me&s;&s;enger told me the old gentle|man
was not at home, but his &s;on was
come along with him, and was coming
up to me. I was perfectly confounded,
for I knew not whether it was peace or
war: However, I had but a few mo|ments
to reflect, for my &s;on was at the
heels of the me&s;&s;enger, and a&s;ked the
fellow, which was the gentlewoman that
&s;ent him. There &s;he is, Sir: at which
he came directly up to me, ki&s;&s;ed me,
took me in his arms and embraced me
with &s;o much tenderne&s;s, that he could
not &s;peak; but I could feel his brea&s;t
heave and throb like a child, that &s;obs,
and cannot cry it out.</P>
<P>I can neither expre&s;s or de&s;cribe the
joy that touched me, when I found,
that he came not as a &s;tranger, but as
a &s;on to a mother, and indeed as a &s;on,
<PB N="267" REF="275">
who had never before known what a
mother of his own was: In &s;hort, we
cried over one another a con&s;iderable
while, when at la&s;t he broke out, &startq;My
dear mother, are you &s;till alive! I
never expected to have &s;een your face:&endq;
as for me, I could &s;ay nothing for a
con&s;iderable time.</P>
<P>After we had both recovered our|&s;elves,
and were able to &s;peak, he &s;aid,
&startq;As to what I had written to his father,
he had not &s;hewed my letter, or told
him any thing about it; that what his
grandmother left me, was in his own
hands, and he would do me ju&s;tice to
my full &s;atisfaction; as to his father,
he was old and infirm, both in body and
mind, that he was almo&s;t blind, and
capable of nothing; and he que&s;tioned
whether he would know how to act in
an affair of &s;o nice a nature, and there|fore
he had come, as well to &s;atisfy
him&s;elf in &s;eeing me, which he could
not re&s;train him&s;elf from, as al&s;o to put
it into my power to make a judgment,
after I had &s;een how things were, whe|ther
I would di&s;cover my&s;elf to his fa|ther,
or no.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="276">
This was &s;o prudently and wi&s;ely
managed, that I found my &s;on needed
no direction from me. I told him as he
knew better than I what his father's
condition was, I &s;hould readily join
with him in &s;uch mea&s;ures as he would
direct.</P>
<P>My &s;on then enquired where I lived.
I told him I was on the Maryland &s;ide
of the Bay, at the plantation of a par|ticular
friend, who came from England
in the &s;ame &s;hip with me; as for that
&s;ide of the Bay where he was; I had no
habitation. He &s;aid, I &s;hould go home
with him, and be with him, if I plea&s;ed,
as long as I lived: That as to his fa|ther
he knew nobody, and would never
&s;o much as gue&s;s at me. I con&s;idered
of that a little, and told him, though it
was really a concern to me to live at a
di&s;tance from his father; yet I could
not &s;ay it would be the mo&s;t comforta|ble
thing to me to live in the hou&s;e
with him; and to have that unhappy
object always before me, which had
been &s;uch a blow to my peace before;
that though I &s;hould be glad to have
your company, my &s;on, or to be as near
<PB N="269" REF="277">
you as po&s;&s;ible while I &s;taid, yet I could
not think of living in the hou&s;e where
I &s;hould be always &s;o under re&s;traint,
for fear of betraying my&s;elf in my di&s;|cour&s;e,
nor &s;hould I be able to refrain
&s;ome expre&s;&s;ions in my conver&s;ing with
you, as my &s;on, that might di&s;cover the
whole affair, which would by no means
be convenient.</P>
<P>He acknowledged that I was right:
but then, dear mother, you &s;hall be
as near me as you can; &s;o he took
me with him on hor&s;eback to a planta|tion
next to his own, and where I was
well entertained. Having fir&s;t called me
his aunt, and telling me he would talk
of the bu&s;ine&s;s the next day, he left me,
and about two hours after, he &s;ent me
a maid-&s;ervant, and a negro boy to wait
on me, and provi&s;ions ready dre&s;&s;ed for
my &s;upper. I began now &s;ecretly to
wi&s;h that I had not come with my hu&s;|band
from England. However, that
wi&s;h was not hearty neither, for I loved
Mr. Carrol entirely, as indeed I had
ever done from the beginning; and he
merited from me as much as it was po&s;|&s;ible
for a man to do.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="278">
The next morning he came again,
and after a little di&s;cour&s;e, he took out
a dear-&s;kin bag, and gave it me, with
fifty Spani&s;h pi&s;toles in it, and told me
that was to &s;upply my expences from
England. Then he pulled out his
grandmother's will, and read it over,
where it appeared, &s;he had left a &s;mall
plantation on York river, where my
mother lived, to me, with the &s;tock of
&s;ervants and cattle upon it, and given it
in tru&s;t to this &s;on of mine for my u&s;e,
whenever he &s;hould hear of my being
alive, and to my heirs, and in default of
heirs, to whom&s;oever I &s;hould, by will,
di&s;po&s;e of it; but gave the income of
it, until I &s;hould be heard of, or
found, to my &s;aid &s;on; and if I &s;hould
not be living, then it was to him and
his heirs.</P>
<P>The plantation, he &s;aid, he did not
let, but managed it by a clerk, as he
did another that was his father's, that
lay by it, and went over him&s;elf three
or four times a year to look after it. I
a&s;ked him what the plantation might be
worth: he &s;aid, if I would let it, he
would give me &s;ixty pounds a year for
<PB N="271" REF="279">
it; but if I would live on it, then it
would be worth much more, and he be|lieved
would bring me in one hundred
and fifty pound a year; but &s;eeing I
was likely either to &s;ettle on the other
&s;ide the Bay, or might perhaps have a
mind to go back to England again, if
I would let him be my &s;teward he would
manage it for me, as he had done for
him&s;elf, and that he believed he &s;hould
be able to &s;end me as much tobacco to
England from it, as would yield me
about one hundred pounds a year.</P>
<P>This was &s;trange news to me; and
really my heart began to look up more
&s;eriou&s;ly, than I think it ever did be|fore,
and to look with great thankful|ne&s;s
to the hand of providence, which
had done &s;uch wonders for me; and I
mu&s;t again ob&s;erve, that not on this
occa&s;ion only, but even on all other oc|ca&s;ions
of thankfulne&s;s, my pa&s;t life
never looked &s;o mon&s;trous to me, and
I never &s;o compleatly abhorred it, and
reproached my&s;elf with it, as when
I had a &s;en&s;e upon me of provi|dence
doing good to me, while I had
<PB N="272" REF="280">
been making tho&s;e vile returns on my
part.</P>
<P>But I leave my readers to improve
the&s;e thoughts, as no doubt they will
&s;ee cau&s;e, and I go on to the fact.
My &s;on's tender carriage, and kind of|fers
fetched tears from me, almo&s;t all
the while he talked; indeed I could
&s;carce di&s;cour&s;e with him, but in the in|tervals
of my pa&s;&s;ion. However, at
length I began, and expre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf
with wonder at my being &s;o happy to
have the tru&s;t of what I had left put
into the hands of my own child, I told
him that as to the inheritance of it, I
had no other child, and was now pa&s;t
having any, if I &s;hould marry, and
therefore would de&s;ire him to get a
writing drawn, which I was ready to
execute, by which I would, after me,
give it wholly to him, and to his heirs;
and in the mean time, &s;miling, I a&s;ked
him, what made him continue a bat|chelor
&s;o long? His an&s;wer was kind
and ready, that Virginia did not yield
any great plenty of wives, and that
&s;ince I talked of going back to Eng|land,
<PB N="273" REF="281">
I &s;hould &s;end him a wife from
London.</P>
<P>This was the &s;ub&s;tance of our fir&s;t
day's conver&s;ation, the plea&s;ante&s;t day
that ever pa&s;t over my head, and gave
me the true&s;t &s;atisfaction. He came
every day after this, and &s;pent great
part of his time with me, and carried
me about to &s;everal of his friends
hou&s;es, where I was entertained with
great re&s;pect; al&s;o I dined &s;everal times
at his own hou&s;e, when he took care
always to have his father &s;o out of
the way, that I never &s;aw him, or he
me.</P>
<P>A few days after, he brought the
writings, and a lawyer; and I &s;igned
them, and delivered them to him with
many ki&s;&s;es. The next day he brought
me an obligation under his hand and
&s;eal, whereby he engaged him&s;elf to
manage the plantation for my account,
and to remit the produce to my order,
wherever I &s;hould be, and withal, to be
obliged him&s;elf to make up the pro|duce
a hundred pounds a year to me.
When he had done &s;o, he told me, I
had a right to the produce of the cur|rent
<PB N="274" REF="282">
year; and he paid me an hundred
pounds in Spani&s;h pieces of eight, and
de&s;ired me to give him a receipt in full
for that year, ending at Chri&s;tmas fol|lowing.</P>
<P>I &s;tayed here above five weeks, and
indeed had much ado to get away then.
Nay, he would have come over the Bay
with me, but I would by no means al|low
him to do it; however, he would
&s;end me over in a &s;loop of his own,
which was built like a yacht, and &s;erved
him as well for plea&s;ure as bu&s;ine&s;s.
This I accepted of; and after the ut|mo&s;t
expre&s;&s;ions both of duty and af|fection,
we parted, and in a few days I
arrived &s;afe at home, to the joy and &s;a|tisfaction
of Mr. Carrol, my hu&s;band.</P>
<P>We went on with our plantation, and
managed it with great &s;ucce&s;s; for hav|ing
a flouri&s;hing &s;tock to begin with,
and this being now encrea&s;ed, we in|larged
our number of &s;ervants, built us
a very good hou&s;e, and cured every year
a great deal of land.</P>
<P>In a word, we were now in ve$y
con&s;iderable circum&s;tances, and every
year encrea&s;ing; for our plantation grew
<PB N="275" REF="283">
upon our hands in&s;en&s;ibly, that the pro|duce
was, at lea&s;t, three hundred pounds
&s;terling a year; I mean worth &s;o much
in England.</P>
<P>After I had been a year at home
again, I went over the Bay to &s;ee my &s;on,
and to receive another year's income of
my plantation; and I was &s;urpri&s;ed to
hear, from my &s;on, that his father was
dead, and had not been buried above a
fortnight. This, I confe&s;s, was not
di&s;agreeable news, becau&s;e now I could
appear, as I was, in a married condi|tion;
&s;o I told my &s;on before I came
from him, that I believed I &s;hould mar|ry
a gentleman who had a plantation
near mine. My &s;on, the &s;ame dutiful
obliging creature as ever, treated me
now at his own hou&s;e, paid me my hun|dred
pounds, and &s;ent me home again
loaded with pre&s;ents.</P>
<P>Some time after this, I acquainted my
&s;on I was married, and invited him o|ver
to &s;ee us; and my hu&s;band wrote a
very obliging letter to him al&s;o, inviting
him to come; and he came accordingly
&s;ome months after.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="284">
It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that when Mr.
Bennet was dead, I gave Mr. Carrol an
account of that affair, and of this ne|phew,
as I had called him, being
my own &s;on, by that mi&s;taken unhappy
match: He was perfectly ea&s;y, and told
me he &s;hould have been &s;o if he had
been &s;till alive; for, &s;aid he, it was
no fault of your's, nor of his; it was a
mi&s;take impo&s;&s;ible to be prevented. He
only reproached him with de&s;iring me to
conceal it, and to live with him as a
wife, after he knew that I was his &s;i&s;ter;
that, he &s;aid, was a vile part. Thus all
the&s;e difficulties were made ea&s;y, and we
lived together with the greate&s;t kindne&s;s
and comfort imaginable.</P>
<P>My hu&s;band, after living here above
eight years, having acquired a hand|&s;ome
fortune, had an opportunity of
di&s;po&s;ing of the plantation to an advan|tage;
and he being de&s;irous of &s;eeing
once more his native country, he &s;old
the e&s;tate, and having accumulated the
&s;um of ten thou&s;and pounds, we took
&s;hipping at Saint James-Town, and after
a plea&s;ant voyage we &s;afely arrived at
<PB N="277" REF="285">
King&s;ale in Ireland, and went from thence
to the city of Gallway, the place of my
hu&s;band's birth.</P>
<P>Here Mr. Carrol purcha&s;ed a free|hold
e&s;tate of four hundred pounds per
annum, and we lived happily together
for two years, after we came to Gallway,
when it plea&s;ed the irrever&s;ible decree
of the Almighty to take my hu&s;band
to him&s;elf, and I became a widow again.
Being now in the decline of life, I &s;e|riou&s;ly
reflect on my pa&s;t follies, and
hope by a true repentance I &s;hall obtain
favour with my incen&s;ed God, who hath
permitted me to run through a long
&s;eries of vice, which have brought me
to a due &s;en&s;e of my manifold omi&s;&s;ions
in the duties of religion, which, until
lately, I have utterly neglected. Thus
I pa&s;s my days in re&s;ignation to the
will and plea&s;ure of my heavenly father,
and finding nature daily to decay, and
believing I am not long for this world,
do make this my la&s;t will and te&s;tament
