<HEAD>Mr. POPE to her Grace the Dutche&s;s of HAMILTON.</HEAD>
<OPENER>London, October&mdash;Betweeen
day and night&mdash;The writer drunk,
<SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MRS. Whitworth (who, as her Epi|taph
on Twitnam Highway a&s;&s;ures us, had attained to as
much perfection and purity as any &s;ince the Apo&s;tles)
is now depo&s;ited according to her own order between
a fig-tree and a vine, there to be found at the la&s;t
Re&s;urrection.</P>
<P>I am ju&s;t come from &s;eeing your Grace in much
the like &s;ituation, between a hony-&s;uckle and a ro&s;e-bu&s;h;
where you are to continue as long as canvas
<PB N="2" REF="8">
can la&s;t: I &s;uppo&s;e the painter by tho&s;e emblems
intended to intimate, on the one hand your Grace's
&s;weet di&s;po&s;ition to your friends; and, on the other,
to &s;hew you are near enough related to the thi&s;tle of
Scotland to de&s;erve the &s;ame motto
with regard to your enemies.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord William will con&s;ter this Latine if you &s;end it to Thi&s;tleworth.</NOTE> <HI>Nemo
me impun&egrave; lace&s;&s;it.</HI></P>
<P>The two foregoing periods, me|thinks,
are &s;o my&s;tical, learned, and perplext, that if
you have any &s;tate&s;men or divines about you, they
can't chu&s;e but be plea&s;ed with them. One divine
you cannot be without, as a good chri&s;tian; and a
&s;tate&s;man you have lately had, for I hear my Lord
Selkirk has been with you. But (that I may not be
unintelligible quite to the bottom of this page) I mu&s;t
tell your Grace in Engli&s;h, that I have made a
painter be&s;tow the afore&s;aid ornaments round about
you (for upon you there needs none), and I am, upon
the whole, plea&s;ed with my picture beyond expre&s;&s;ion.
I may now &s;ay of your picture, it is the thing in the
world the like&s;t you, except your&s;elf; as a cautious
per&s;on once &s;aid of an elephant, it was the bigge&s;t
in the world, except it&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="9">
You &s;ee, Madam, it is not impo&s;&s;ible for you to
be compared to an elephant: and you mu&s;t give me
leave to &s;how you one may carry on the &s;imile.</P>
<P>An elephant never bends his knees; and I am
told your Grace &s;ays no prayers. An elephant has
a mo&s;t remarkable command of his &s;nout, and &s;o has
your Grace when you imitate my Lady O&mdash;y.
An elephant is a great lover of men, and &s;o is your
Grace for all I know, tho' from your partiality to
my&s;elf, I &s;hould rather think you lov'd little children.</P>
<P>I beg you not to be di&s;couraged in this point.
Remember the text which I'll preach upon, the fir&s;t
day I am a par&s;on. <HI>Suffer little children to come to me&mdash;</HI>
And&mdash;<HI>De&s;pi&s;e not one of the&s;e little ones.</HI></P>
<P>No, Madam&mdash;de&s;pi&s;e great bears, &s;uch as Gay;
who now goes by the dredful name of, <HI>The Bea&s;t of
Blois,</HI> where Mr. Pulteney and he are &s;ettled, and
where he &s;hows tricks gratis, to all the bea&s;ts of
his own country (for &s;trangers do not yet under&s;tand
the voice of the bea&s;t). I have heard from him but
once, Lord Warwick twice, Mrs. Lepell thrice: if
there be any that has heard from him four times, I
&s;uppo&s;e it is you.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="10">
I beg Mr. Blondel may know, Dr. Logg has re|ceived
Ordination, and enters upon his function this
winter at Mrs. Blount's. They have cho&s;en this
innocent man for their confe&s;&s;or; and I believe mo&s;t
Roman Catholick ladies, that have any &s;ins, will
follow their example. This good prie&s;t will be of
the order of Melchi&s;edeck, a prie&s;t for ever, and
&s;erve a family from generation to generation. He'll
&s;tand in a corner as quietly as a clock, and being
wound up once a week, &s;trike up a loud alarum to
&s;in on a Sunday morning. Nay, if the Chri&s;tian
Religion &s;hould be aboli&s;h'd (as indeed there is great
rea&s;on to expect it from the wi&s;dom of the legi&s;lature),
he might at wor&s;t make an excellent bonefire, which
is all that (upon a change of religion) can be de&s;ired
from a heretique. I do not hope your Grace &s;hould
be converted, but however I wi&s;h you would call at
Mrs. B.'s out of curio&s;ity. To meet people one
likes, is thought by &s;ome the be&s;t rea&s;on for going
to church, and I dare promi&s;e you'll like one ano|ther.
They are extreamly your &s;ervants, or el&s;e I
&s;hould not think them my friends.</P>
<P>I ought to keep up the cu&s;tom, and a&s;k you to
&s;end me &s;omething. Therefore pray, Madam, &s;end
<PB N="5" REF="11">
me your&s;elf, that is, a letter; and pray make ha&s;te
to bring up your&s;elf, that is all I value, to towne.
I am, with the true&s;t re&s;pect, the lea&s;t ceremony,
and the mo&s;t zeal,</P>

BUCKINGHAMSHIRE<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The Duke married to his third wife Catherine, na|tural daughter of king James II. (by Catherine Sidley, daughter of Sir Charles Sidley, whom he created Coun|te&s;s of Dorche&s;ter, and who, upon his abdicating the throne, married the earl of Portmore): He dignified her with the name of the lady Catherine Darnley, gave her the place of a Duke's daughter, and permitted her to bear his arms. She was, very young, left a widow by James Earl of Angle&s;ey, from whom &s;he was divorced by the King and both Hou&s;es of Parliament, for the Earl's ill u&s;age of her.</NOTE>.</HEAD>

<SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Think my&s;elf obliged by your Grace's
many conde&s;cen&s;ions of goodne&s;s to me, in particular
<PB N="6" REF="12">
your informing me by a line of Dr. Ch&mdash;'s<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Chamberlen's.</NOTE> &s;tate of
health. I am really impatient to hear further of him.</P>
<P>The morning I left the town, I went with Mr.
Jervas to Belluchi's<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">An Italian painter, who compo&s;ed the Duke's monu|ment, to which this alludes; whereon are repre&s;ented the portraiture of his Grace, habited like a Roman general; and at his feet, that of her Grace weeping. On the top of the ba&s;is of the column, is &s;een, in relievo, Time bearing away the four decea&s;ed children of the Dutche&s;s, who&s;e effigies are repre&s;ented in profile-bu&s;tos, &s;upported by Cupids lamenting.</NOTE>, but parting in ha&s;te, I had
not his opinion at large; only he a&s;&s;ures me, he
thinks the figures will not be too &s;mall, con&s;idering
that tho&s;e which are neare&s;t the eye, are, at lea&s;t, as
large as the life. I can't but be of opinion, that my
Lord Duke's and your Grace's, ought to be made
portraits, and as like as po&s;&s;ible; of which they
have yet no re&s;emblance. There being no picture
(as I believe) of the Duke in profile, it might be
well, I fancy, if Belluchi copied the &s;ide-face from
that bu&s;to that &s;tands in the &s;alon.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="13">
I beg your Grace's pardon for the freedom with
which I write to you: and I ought to a&s;k it, (now
I think on't) on another occa&s;ion, in which I have
u&s;ed too much freedom: having a great e&s;teem for
the famous Bononcini, not only from his great fame,
but from a per&s;onal knowledge of his character; and
this being increa&s;ed by the ill treatment he has met
with here, I ventured, among other per&s;ons of the
fir&s;t di&s;tinction, who &s;ub&s;cribed to me for his com|po&s;ures,
newly ingraved, to &s;et down the name of
your Grace. When I did this, your Grace was at
Bath, and I forgot ever &s;ince to tell you of it, 'till
now, when the book's<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">His Cantatas.</NOTE> coming out, put me in mind
of it.</P>
<P>If you can excu&s;e this fault, I &s;incerely think I
&s;hall not err this way again, 'till &s;uch another great
man as Bononcini ari&s;es, (for whenever that happens,
I doubt not the Engli&s;h will u&s;e him as &s;curvily) but
that your Grace needs not apprehend, during our
lives. I am, with the &s;incere&s;t re&s;pect,</P>

<P>HAVING no le&s;s admiration for your

you have but too often demanded of me, and which
heretofore hath indeed been heard by others, but till
now, hath not been read by any.</P>
<P>It is my wi&s;h, that the &s;ame fortune may in this

have for &s;o long time concealed the noble&s;t things in

a le&s;s power than what you have within the&s;e few days
gained upon me, would not have been &s;ufficient to

high time it were delivered of them, to make room

<P>THO' my liberality were, as you &s;ay,
greater than Alexander's, it were more than recom|penced
by the thanks you have been plea&s;ed to return
it. Even his ambition, as in&s;atiable as it was, would,
by &s;o extraordinary a favour, have been limited. He
would have valued this honour more highly than the
Per&s;ian diadem, and he would not have envied Achil|les
the prai&s;es of Homer, might he have yours. In
like manner, madam, con&s;idering the reputation you
do me, if I envy his, it is not &s;o much that which he
hath acquired, as what you have be&s;towed on him;
and he hath received no honours which I do not look
upon below my own, unle&s;s it be that you do him,
when you call him your gallant. Neither his own

<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Could never believe it po&s;&s;ible that the
receipt of a letter from you &s;hould add to my afflic|tion,
or that you could have po&s;&s;ibly &s;ent me &s;uch bad
news, as that you could not comfort me at the &s;ame

<P><PB N="14" REF="20">
I thought my unhappine&s;s at &s;uch a point as could
not admit of any addition, and that &s;ince you were
able &s;omething to &s;trengthen my patience to endure
the ab&s;ence of your mother and you, there could not
be any misfortune which you could not have encou|raged
me to &s;uffer. But give me leave to tell you,
that I have found the contrary in the affliction I have
for the death of Mrs. A&mdash;, which hath been heavy
enough to cru&s;h me, and wanted not much to &s;pend
the remainder of my patience.</P>
<P>You may ea&s;ily judge, madam, what an exce&s;&s;ive
grief it mu&s;t needs be to me to have lo&s;t a friend &s;o
good, &s;o &s;prightly and &s;o accompli&s;hed as &s;he, and
one that having always given me &s;o many expre&s;&s;ions
of her affection, would needs do &s;omething when &s;he
had not many hours to continue here. But tho' I re|flected
not on my own concernments, yet could I not
but infinitely regret a per&s;on by whom you were infi|nitely
beloved; and who, among many particular
endowments, had that of knowing you as much as
may be, and e&s;teeming you above all things. Yet I
mu&s;t confe&s;s, if this di&s;turbance can admit of any
remi&s;&s;ion, it is to reflect on the con&s;tancy &s;he expre&s;|&s;ed,
and the fortitude wherewith &s;he hath &s;uffered a
thing whereof the name would make her tremble at
any time.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="21">
I am extremely comforted to under&s;tand, that at her
death, &s;he had tho&s;e qualities which only &s;he wanted
in her life, and that &s;he &s;o opportunely found courage
and re&s;olution. When I con&s;ider it &s;eriou&s;ly, it is
&s;omewhat again&s;t my con&s;cience to bemoan her; and
methinks it &s;peaks an over-intere&s;ted affection, to be
&s;ad becau&s;e &s;he hath left us to better her condition,
and is gone into the other world, (&startq;from who&s;e
bourne no traveller returns&endq;) to find that quiet &s;he
could never meet with in this.</P>
<P>I very heartily entertain the exhortations you give
me thereupon, which is often to con over a le&s;&s;on &s;o
profitable and nece&s;&s;ary, and to prepare my&s;elf for the
like one day. I know how to make my advantage of
your remon&s;trance. The mi&s;eries we have run thro'
all this while is no &s;mall preparation for it: there's
no better lecture to in&s;truct a man how to die well,
than not to take much plea&s;ure in living.</P>
<P>But if it be not impo&s;&s;ible for the hopes that for|tune
propo&s;es to prove effectual; if after &s;o many
years, we may pre&s;ume to expect &s;ome few fair days,
be plea&s;ed to give me leave, madam, to entertain
thoughts more diverting than tho&s;e of death; and if
it be likely that we are &s;hortly to &s;ee one another, let

<HEAD TYPE="sub">To a LADY in the Name of her BROTHER.</HEAD>
<P>IF you have not a cha&s;te ear and a
pure heart, do not peru&s;e this letter; for, as Jeremy
Taylor &s;ays in his Holy Living and Dying, the fir&s;t
thing a virgin ought to endeavour, is to be ignorant
of the di&s;tinction of &s;exes.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="23">
It is in the confidence I have that you are thus
innocent, that I endeavour to gratify your curio&s;ity
in a point, in which I am &s;en&s;ible none but a brother
could do it with decency.</P>
<P>I &s;hall entertain you with the mo&s;t reigning curi|o&s;ity
in the town; I mean a per&s;on who is equally
the toa&s;t of gentlemen and ladies, and is at pre&s;ent
more univer&s;ally admired than any of either &s;ex. You
know how few proficients have a greater genius for
mon&s;ters, than my&s;elf; but I never ta&s;ted a mon&s;ter
to that degree I have done this creature. It was not,
like other mon&s;ters, produced in the de&s;arts of Arabia,
nor came from the country of the Great Mogul; but
is the production of the joint endeavours of a Kenti&s;h
par&s;on and his &s;pou&s;e, who intended in the &s;inglene&s;s
of heart to have begot a chri&s;tian but of one &s;ex, and
Providence has &s;ent them one of two.</P>
<P>There are various opinions concerning this crea|ture
about town. Mr. Cromwell ob&s;erves that the
age is very licentious, and the pre&s;ent reign very lewd
and corrupt, in permitting a Lady <HI>By Authority</HI> (as
appears by the printed bills) to expo&s;e her per&s;onal
curio&s;ities for a &s;hilling.</P>
<P>Mr. P&mdash;looks upon it as a prodigy portending
&s;ome great revolution in the &s;tate; to &s;trengthen
<PB N="18" REF="24">
which opinion, he produces the following prophecy
of No&s;tradamus, which he explains politically:
<Q><L>&startq;When as two &s;exes join'd in one,</L>
<L>Shall in the realm of Brute be &s;hown;</L>
<L>Then factions &s;hall unite, if I know,</L>
<L>To choo&s;e a Prince <HI>Jure Divino.</HI></L>
<L>This prodigy of common gender</L>
<L>Is neither &s;ex, but a Pretender;</L>
<L>So the Lord &s;hield the Faith's Defender.&endq;</L></Q></P>
<P>Mrs. N&mdash;admires what people wonder at &s;o much;
and &s;ays &s;he is ju&s;t &s;o her&s;elf. The Duche&s;s of S&mdash;is
of the &s;ame opinion.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e various conjectures, that I might be
informed of the truth, I took along with me a Phy|&s;ician
and a Divine; the one to in&s;pect the &s;tate of its
body, the other to examine that of its mind. The
per&s;ons I made choice of were the ingenious Dr. P&mdash;,
and the reverend Mr.&mdash;. We were no &s;ooner in the
room, but the party came to us dre&s;t in that habit, in
which the ladies affect an hermaphroditical imitation
of men&mdash;your &s;harp wit, my dear &s;i&s;ter, will im|mediately
conclude that I mean a riding-habit.</P>
<P>I think it not material to inform you, whether the
doctor, the divine, or my&s;elf look'd fir&s;t. The prie&s;t,
<PB N="19" REF="25">
you will maliciou&s;ly fancy, was in his nature mo&s;t an
infidel, and doubted mo&s;t of this miracle; we there|fore
propos'd to him to take the &s;ure&s;t method of be|lieving,
&s;eeing and feeling. He comply'd with both
admonitions, and having taken a large pinch of &s;nuff
upon it, advis'd us with a nod, that we &s;hould by no
means regard it as female, but as a male, for by &s;o
doing we &s;hould be guilty of le&s;s &s;infulne&s;s.</P>
<P>The doctor upon in&s;pection differ'd from this opi|nion;
he wou'd by no means allow it a miracle, or at
mo&s;t a natural one. He &s;aid upon the whole it was
a woman; that whatever might give a handle to think
otherwi&s;e, was a trifle; nothing being more common
than for a child to be mark'd with that thing which
the mother long'd for.</P>
<P>As for this party's temper of mind, it appears to
be a mo&s;t even di&s;po&s;ition, partaking of the good
qualities of both &s;exes; for &s;he is neither &s;o inacce&s;|&s;ible
as other ladies, nor is he &s;o impudent as other
gentlemen. Of how obliging and complai&s;ant a turn
appears by this; that he tells the ladies he has the
inclinations of a gentleman, and that &s;he tells the
gentlemen &s;he has the <HI>tendre</HI> of a lady. As a farther
proof of this affable di&s;po&s;ition, he formerly receiv'd
vi&s;its of the fair &s;ex in their ma&s;ques; till an imper|tinent
<PB N="20" REF="26">
fellow in a female di&s;gui&s;e, mingled with a
party of ladies, and impudently overheard their
improving &s;peculations.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this, &s;he civilly promi&s;ed at my
reque&s;t, that my two &s;i&s;ters &s;hould be admitted pri|vately,
whenever you would do her the honour of
your con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>How agreeable &s;oever this &s;ight has been to me, I
a&s;&s;ure you it cannot be &s;o plea&s;ing as the &s;ight of you
in town; and whatever you may &s;ee in the country, I
dare affirm no man or woman can &s;hew you the like.</P>
<P>I therefore earne&s;tly de&s;ire you to make ha&s;te to
this place; for tho' indeed, like mo&s;t other brothers,
I &s;hould be &s;orry you were married at my expence;
yet I would by no means, like them, detain you in
the country from your admirers: for you may believe

<HEAD>LETTER VI<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This &s;arca&s;tical letter, and the ver&s;es de&s;cribing Blen|heim, in&s;erted among the poetry, were perhaps rejected in compliment to the pre&s;ent proprietors of that heavy piece of architecture.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>I Will not de&s;cribe Bl&mdash;in particular,
not to fore&s;tal your expectations before you &s;ee it:
only take a &s;hort account, which, I will hazard my
little credit, is no unju&s;t one. I never &s;aw &s;o great
a thing with &s;o much littlene&s;s in it: I think the
architect built it entirely in complai&s;ance to the ta&s;te
of its owners; for it is the mo&s;t inho&s;pitable thing
imaginable, and the mo&s;t &s;elfi&s;h: it has, like their
own hearts, no room for &s;trangers, and no reception
for any per&s;on of &s;uperior quality to them&s;elves.
There are but ju&s;t two apartments, for the ma&s;ter
and mi&s;tre&s;s, below; and but two apartments above,
(very much inferior to them) in the whole hou&s;e.
When you look upon the out&s;ide, you'd think it
large enough for a prince; when you &s;ee the in&s;ide,
it is too little for a &s;ubject; and has not conveniency
to lodge a common family. It is a hou&s;e of entries
and pa&s;&s;ages; among which there are three vi&s;ta's
thro' the whole, very u&s;ele&s;sly hand&s;ome. There is
what might have been a fine gallery, but &s;poil'd by
<PB N="22" REF="28">
two arches towards the end of it, which take away
the &s;ight of &s;everal of the windows. There are two
ordinary &s;tair-ca&s;es in&s;tead of one great one. The
be&s;t things within the hou&s;e are the hall, which is
indeed noble and well proportioned; and the cellars
and offices under-ground, which are the mo&s;t com|modious,
and the be&s;t contrived of the whole. At
the top of the building are &s;everal cupola's and little
turrets that have but an ill effect, and make the
building look at once finical and heavy. What
&s;eems of the be&s;t ta&s;te, is that front towards the
gardens, which is not yet loaded with the&s;e turrets.
The two &s;ides of the building are entirely &s;poiled by
two mon&s;trous bow-windows, which &s;tand ju&s;t in the
middle, in&s;tead of doors: and, as if it were fatal,
that &s;ome trifling littlene&s;s &s;hould every where de&s;troy
the grandeur, there are in the chief front two &s;emi|circles
of a lower &s;tructure than the re&s;t, that cut off
the angles, and look as if they were purpo&s;ely de|&s;igned
to hide a loftier and nobler piece of building,
the top of which appears above them. In a word,
the whole is a mo&s;t expen&s;ive ab&s;urdity; and the
Duke of Shrew&s;bury gave a true character of it,
when he &s;aid, it was a great quarry of &s;tones above
ground.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="29">
We paid a vi&s;it to the &s;pring, where Ro&s;amond
bathed her&s;elf; on a hill where remains only a piece
of a wall of the old palace of Henry II. We toa&s;ted
her &s;hade in the cold water, not without a thought
or two, &s;carce &s;o cold as the liquor we drank it in.

<P>UPON what you told me when I was
la&s;t to wait on you, I deferr'd treating further for
the rent-charge, till you could be more certain what
&s;umm you could conveniently rai&s;e in pre&s;ent, to|wards
the purcha&s;e. If there were only three of
400l. wanting, we would take your bond; for as
to a mortgage on the rent-charge, my father is not
qualified to take it; for by an Act of Parliament he
cannot buy land, tho' he may &s;ell. However, if
you de&s;ire to make the purcha&s;e &s;oon, I believe I
have a friend who will lend you the 1000 l. on the
&s;ame &s;ecurity you offer us. If you have any other
&s;cruple, you'll plea&s;e to tell it me fairly; but if this
purcha&s;e be convenient to you, we &s;hall think of
treating with no other, and be ready upon your
an&s;wer; &s;ince I think what I here propo&s;e, entirely
accommodates all the difficulty you &s;eem to be at.</P>

<P>I Beg you to let me know if you have
any thoughts of your Devon&s;hire journey this &s;ummer.
If you have, I will &s;tay for you, and let Mr.
Forte&s;cue and Gay travel together. This re&s;olution
mu&s;t be made with &s;ome ha&s;te, becau&s;e they go next
week, and I &s;hall want time to prepare. I thought
Mrs. Cecil had receipts before. The names of Lady
Ranelagh and Lady Cavendi&s;h, were in&s;erted long
&s;ince in the li&s;t.</P>
<P>You may tell Mr. Rollin&s;on that Gay was not
&s;ure he &s;hould go to Lord Bolingbroke's when he
came hither; or help him to &s;ome excu&s;e, for his
neglect was &s;candalous, and has given him much
vexation of &s;pirit.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have been glad to have had the Report of
the Committee, and have &s;ince writ to Lintott for it.
If the Whigs now &s;ay, that B. is the hero of my
Preface, the Tories &s;aid (you may remember) three
years ago, that Cato was the hero of my poetry. It
looks generous enough to be always on the &s;ide of
the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; and my patrons of the other party
<PB N="32" REF="38">
may expect great panegyricks from me when they
come to be impeached by the future party rage of
their opponents. To compliment tho&s;e who are
<HI>dead in law,</HI> is as much above the imputation of
flattery, as Tickell &s;ays it is, to compliment tho&s;e
who are really <HI>dead.</HI> And perhaps too there is as
much <HI>vanity</HI> in my prai&s;ing Bol&mdash;, as in his prai|&s;ing
Hal&mdash;. No people in the world are &s;o apt to
give them&s;elves airs as authors.</P>
<P>I have received the report, but have not yet had
time to read any of it. I have gone through the 5th,
6th, and 7th books, except a &s;mall part of the latter
end of the 6th.&mdash;Pray tell me if you hear any thing
&s;aid about Mr. Tickell's, or my tran&s;lation, if the
town be not too much taken up with great affairs, to
take any notice of either.</P>
<P>I hold the re&s;olution I told you in my la&s;t, of &s;ee|ing
you if you cannot take a trip hither before I goe.
But I would fain flatter my&s;elf &s;o far as to fancy we
might travel together. Pray give me a line by
Saturday's po&s;t.</P>

the truths he knows of it, even the wor&s;t, with the
&s;incerity and ju&s;tice of an unconcerned hi&s;torian?
Now, methinks, I &s;ee you &s;mile, and a&s;k me, What
is it you thus endeavour to conceal? Is not the
fidelity of your i&s;land become a proverb; your policy
a je&s;t; your politene&s;s, wantonne&s;s and mimickry;
your commerce, a combination of protected thieves,
the bane of indu&s;try and trade? Nor is there any
other &s;ign of divinity or liberty remaining with you,
except the opening of your churches and the courts
of ju&s;tice; in a word, it is become the characteri&s;tic
of the Engli&s;h, that they account it le&s;s glorious to
act wi&s;ely, than to defend the doing otherwi&s;e. Yes,
<PB N="37" REF="43">
there is too much truth in your remarks; the remem|brance

&s;entiments of hone&s;ty and religion, they mu&s;t be very
&s;ecret, if they would e&s;cape the public laughter.
This may be an excu&s;e for the &s;on of your friend;
he came green upon the &s;tage, was hurried into the

were no &s;mall temptation to engage him with the

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALL the books which have been
publi&s;hed here, worthy notice, I have con&s;tantly
&s;ent as you directed: if I have with-held my opi|nion
of their merit, as you complain, it was for
many rea&s;ons I judged it unnece&s;&s;ary. Why do you
&s;o continually attack my vanity, by the compliments
you pay my judgment? But &s;ince you &s;eek &s;ome par|ticulars
of Mr. Pope, who&s;e writings I pro&s;e&s;s,
among&s;t thou&s;ands, to be an admirer of, as I have
often intimated, I will take this occa&s;ion to inform
you what I know concerning him. Many pieces of
his, The E&s;&s;ay on Critici&s;m; The Rape of the
Lock; The E&s;&s;ays and Di&s;&s;ertations on Homer,
have appeared in your parts: and one proof of their
excellency, is their being naturalized by per&s;ons of
very eminent ability and rank. Other languages<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">They have been tran&s;lated both into French and Italian.</NOTE>
are inrich'd with the&s;e and others of his works; yet,
would you believe it, he has tran&s;lated Homer, pre|&s;erv'd
the &s;ublimity, &s;trength, harmony, clo&s;ene&s;s,
and every other excellence of that venerable poet,
<PB N="39" REF="45">
without knowing a &s;yllable of Greek<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Pope's Letter to Addi&s;on, Jan. 30, 1713-14.</NOTE>; and with
an ab&s;olute ignorance of the Engli&s;h. His E&s;&s;ay
on Critici&s;m, is a &s;mooth repetition of Vida's non|&s;en&s;e.
His Pa&s;torals are no Pa&s;torals. Nor is he a
poet. The&s;e things are brayed about our &s;treets.
The <HI>A&s;inorum crepitus,</HI> the din of Grub-&s;treet pre|tenders
to poetry, and fal&s;e critics, have aro&s;e to
poi&s;on our judgments; &s;ome &s;ay, he is too little to
write well; others, that he has only a knack of
writing, and the&s;e wretches all write them&s;elves, to
convince us it is without a knack; cellars are full of
their murmurings, where, like &s;o many mercile&s;s
chymi&s;ts, they violently rack and torture nature to
confe&s;s &s;ome worth &s;he has not in her. Mr. Pope is
accounted by tho&s;e, not his enemies, of overmuch
borrowing; this you will rather prai&s;e than di&s;ap|prove,
when you &s;hall know, that the fine&s;t thoughts
of the be&s;t writers were never made u&s;e of by him,
till he had improved and made them better. View
him in his public character, he is an honour to our
nation; the good and wi&s;e rejoice that &s;uch and &s;o
notable a genius is manife&s;ted among&s;t us; he has the
&s;atisfaction of not having lived in vain, and has
obliged the valuable part of mankind, and is beloved
<PB N="40" REF="46">
by all the learned, good, and wi&s;e. View him in
private life, there is nothing more amiable and endear|ing.
He is an example of the duty we owe our
parents, and the love we ought to bear our friends.
There is no truth, if what I tell you is not true; no
friend&s;hip, if I am not your friend.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">That the&s;e Letters were written by Mr. Pope to Mr. Gay appears by the compliment paid him in this third Letter; for the works of his friend, and the cata&s;trophe of his play, evidently allude to the <HI>Beggar's Opera.</HI> So the character in the conclu&s;ion of the &s;econd cor|re&s;ponds with that which Mr. Jacob (in his Letter to Mr. Dennis, April 24, 1729, publi&s;hed by Mr. Dennis in his Remarks on the <HI>Dunciad</HI>) mentions:&mdash;In the Lives of the Poets, by Mr. Jacob, Vol. II. p. 145, 146, 151, &amp;c. the &s;entences following are by his authority: &startq;This excellent poet, [Alexander Pope] who&s;e fame exceeds not his merit, was born, &amp;c. There is great ea&s;e, &s;trength, wit, and judgment, in his compo&s;itions; all his pieces are univer&s;ally applauded, and the great Sheffield a&s;&s;erted his work. His private character is the be&s;t, being &s;umm'd up in a good companion and a firm friend. Mr. Pope has fire and &s;pirit equal to that great undertaking, his tran&s;lation of Homer: and he is excellent in pro&s;e as well as ver&s;e,&endq; &amp;c. That the&s;e high prai&s;es and commendations of him&s;elf were by him particularly approved of, in a printed proof of his life and character, which I tran&s;mitted to him for his correction, I am ready to make oath of, if requir'd; and by his alterations and additions therein, he entirely made the compliment his own.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FORGIVE me, if I obtrude my ad|vice;
think not of publi&s;hing, as yet. Your works,
like fine painting and wine, will ripen into more
<PB N="41" REF="47">
worth by age; you &s;hould certainly complete the

hi&s;tory, &s;tripp'd of courtiers and attendants. If in
their lives they had few &s;ure friends, after their deaths
they &s;hall have fewer. It is then that the glory is
taken from their heads, and their pride trampled on.
Are they not deceived, my friend, who think by
power to bury in oblivion the ill actions they are
guilty of; or to keep po&s;terity from the knowledge
of their vices? I was the other day at a great man's
levee; it made me &s;hudder: he was corpulent and
gro&s;s of body, and &s;eem'd to me as if fattening for
<PB N="42" REF="48">
&s;ome &s;acrifice. I then thought a corrupt mini&s;ter,
&s;urrounded by his creatures and mercenaries, like the
man, who by unlawful practices had obtained the
&s;ervices of evil &s;pirits, and thinks it noble to be at|tended
on by fiends, but yet expects in the end,
that they will tear him to pieces.</P>

you that &s;ilence is not always the &s;ure&s;t guard again&s;t
impertinence: I have too great a &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e many
civilities receiv'd from you, to de&s;i&s;t from expre&s;&s;ing
it, till I receive more: for you not only have ac|quainted
<PB N="59" REF="65">
me with many of my errors in &s;cribling,
but with &s;ome in my conduct; and I owe to you the
knowledge of things infinitely more of concern to
my&s;elf, than any thing of mine can be to others.
The advantage I have obtain'd from both might
endanger your being put upon an endle&s;s trouble of
criticizing on the re&s;t of my faults, and therefore
you have rea&s;on to make &s;ome delay with tho&s;e now

you &s;hou'd once look upon them, but when you were
perfectly at lei&s;ure; yet &s;o much a&s;&s;urance your
former kindne&s;s had given me, that I was under
&s;ome apprehen&s;ions for your health, on the &s;core of

me on that &s;ubject; which he did not, either through
forgetfulne&s;s, or el&s;e believing I &s;hou'd be &s;oon in

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE>
<DATE>November 24, 1710.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>TO make u&s;e of that freedom
and familiarity of &s;tyle which we have taken up in
our corre&s;pondence, and which is more properly talk|ing
upon paper, than writing; I will tell you with|out
any preface, that I never took Tycho Brahe for
one of the antients, or in the lea&s;t an acquaintanc$
of Lucan's; nay 'tis a mercy on this occa&s;ion that I
do not give you an account of his life and conver|&s;ation,
which perhaps I know a little more of than
you imagine; as how he lived &s;ome years like an in|chanted
<PB N="67" REF="73">
knight in a certain i&s;land, with a tale into
the bargain of a king of Denmark's mi&s;tre&s;s that
&s;hall be namele&s;s.&mdash;But I have compa&s;&s;ion on you,
and wou'd not for the world you &s;hou'd &s;tay any
longer among the <HI>Genii</HI> and <HI>Semidei Manes,</HI> you know
where; for if once you get &s;o near the moon, Sapho
will want your pre&s;ence in the clouds, and inferior
regions; not to mention the great lo&s;s Drury-lane
will &s;u&s;tain, when Mr. Cromwell is in the Milky
Way. The&s;e cele&s;tial thoughts put me in mind of
the prie&s;ts you mention, who are a &s;ort of Sortilegi
in one &s;en&s;e, becau&s;e in their lottery there are more
blanks than prizes; the adventurers being at be&s;t in
an uncertainty, whereas the &s;etters up are &s;ure of
&s;omething. Prie&s;ts indeed in their character, as
they repre&s;ent God, are &s;acred; and &s;o are con|&s;tables
as they repre&s;ent the king; but you will own
a great many of 'em are very odd fellows, and the
devil a bit of likene&s;s in 'em. Yet I do a&s;&s;ure you,
I honour the good as much as I dete&s;t the bad, and
I think, that in condemning the&s;e, we prai&s;e tho&s;e.
I am &s;o far from e&s;teeming ev'n the wor&s;t unworthy
of my protection, that I have defended their cha|racter
(in Congreve's and Vanbrugh's plays) ev'n
again&s;t their own brethren. And &s;o much for prie&s;ts
in general. Now for Trapp in particular, who&s;e
<PB N="68" REF="74">
tran&s;lations from Ovid I have not &s;o good an opi|nion
of as you; not (I will a&s;&s;ure you) on account
of any &s;ort of prejudice to him as a prie&s;t, but be|cau&s;e,
I think, he has nothing of the main cha|racteri&s;tick
of his author, a graceful ea&s;ine&s;s. For
let the &s;en&s;e be never &s;o exactly render'd, unle&s;s an
author looks like him&s;elf in his air, habit, and
manner, 'tis a di&s;gui&s;e and not a tran&s;lation. But as
to the P&s;alm, I think David is much more beholding
to him than Ovid; and as he treated the Roman like
a Jew, &s;o he has made the Jew &s;peak like a Roman.</P>
<P>Your mention in this and your la&s;t letter of the
defect in numbers of &s;everal of our poets, puts me
upon communicating a few thoughts, or rather
doubts of mine on that head, &s;ome of which 'tis
likely I may have hinted to you formerly in con|ver&s;ation:
but I will here put together all the little
niceties I can recollect in the compa&s;s of my ob|&s;ervation.</P>
<P>(1.) As to the Hiatus, it is certainly to be avoided
as often as po&s;&s;ible; but on the other hand, &s;ince
the rea&s;on of it is only for the &s;ake of the numbers,
&s;o if, to avoid it, we incur another fault again&s;t their
&s;moothne&s;s, methinks the very end of that nicety is
de&s;troy'd: as when we &s;ay (for in&s;tance)</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="75">
&startq;But th' old have intere&s;t ever in their view.&endq;</P>
<P>To avoid the Hiatus, in&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash;&startq;The old have int're&s;t&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>Does not the ear in this place tell us, that the Hiatus
is &s;moother, le&s;s con&s;train'd, and &s;o preferable to the
Cae&s;ura?</P>
<P>(2.) I wou'd except again&s;t all expletives in ver&s;e,
as <HI>do</HI> before verbs plural, or ev'n too frequent u&s;e of
<HI>did</HI> or <HI>does,</HI> to change the termination of the rhime;
all the&s;e being again&s;t the u&s;ual manner of &s;peech,
and meer fillers up of unnece&s;&s;ary &s;yllables.</P>
<P>(3.) Mono&s;yllable-lines, unle&s;s very artfully ma|nag'd,
are &s;tiff, langui&s;hing, and hard.</P>
<P>(4.) The repeating the &s;ame rhimes within four or
&s;ix lines of each other; which tire the ear with too
much of the like &s;ound.</P>
<P>(5.) The too frequent u&s;e of Alexandrines, which
are never graceful but when there is &s;ome maje&s;ty
added to the ver&s;e by 'em, or when there cannot be
found in 'em a word but what is ab&s;olutely needful.</P>
<P>(6.) Every nice ear mu&s;t (I believe) have ob|&s;erv'd,
that in any &s;mooth Engli&s;h ver&s;e of ten &s;yl|lables,
<PB N="70" REF="76">
there is naturally a pau&s;e at the fourth, fifth,
or &s;ixth &s;yllable; as for example, Waller.</P>
<L>At the fifth.</L>
<L>&startq;Where-e'er thy navy $ &s;preads her canva&s;s wings,&endq;</L>
<L>At the fourth.</L>
<L>&startq;Homage to thee $ and peace to all &s;he brings.&endq;</L>
<L>At the &s;ixth.</L>
<L>&startq;Like tracts of leverets $ in morning &s;now.&endq;</L>
<P>Now I fancy, that to pre&s;erve an exact harmony
and variety, none of the&s;e pau&s;es &s;hou'd be continu'd
above three lines together without the interpo&s;ition of
another; el&s;e it will be apt to weary the ear with one
continu'd tone; at lea&s;t it does mine.</P>
<P>(7.) It is not enough that nothing offends the ear,
that the ver&s;e be (as the French call it) <HI>coulante;</HI> but
a good poet will adapt the very &s;ounds, as well as
words, to the things he treats of. So that there is
(if one may expre&s;s it &s;o) a &s;tyle of &s;ound: as in
de&s;cribing a gliding &s;tream, the numbers &s;hou'd run
ea&s;y and flowing; in de&s;cribing a rough torrent or
deluge, &s;onorous and &s;welling; and &s;o of the re&s;t.
This is evident every where in Homer and Virgil,
and no where el&s;e that I know of to any ob&s;ervable
<PB N="71" REF="77">
degree. The following examples will make this very
plain, which I have taken from Vida.</P>
<Q><L>Molle viam tacito lap&s;u per laevia radit.</L>
<L>Incedit tardo molimine &s;ub&s;idendo.</L>
<L>Luctantes ventos, tempe&s;tate&s;que &s;onoras.</L>
<L>Immen&s;o cum praecipitans ruit oceano nox.</L>
<L>Telum imbelle &s;ine ictu, conjecit.</L>
<L>Tolle moras, cape &s;axa manu, cape robora, pa&s;tor.</L>
<L>Ferte citi flammas, date tela, repellite pe&s;tem.</L></Q>
<P>This, I think, is what very few ob&s;erve in practice,
and is undoubtedly of wonderful force in imprinting
the image on the reader: we have one excellent
example of this in our language, Mr. Dryden's Ode
on St. Caecilia's day, entitled, Alexander's Fea&s;t; or,
The Power of Mu&s;ick.</P>
<P>I a&s;k your pardon for this tedious Letter, and ex|pect
a long one in an&s;wer to the&s;e notions concern|ing
the ver&s;ification. I expect al&s;o the voyage of
Ovid's mi&s;tre&s;s with more impatience than Ovid
him&s;elf cou'd her return. The other journey you
&s;peak of (mine to London) mu&s;t yet be deferr'd;
but tho' I de&s;ire nothing more than to enjoy the hap|pine&s;s
of your conver&s;ation, yet I have too much
con&s;cience to let mine co&s;t you any thing but your
<PB N="72" REF="78">
patience. I am heartily &s;orry for poor Mr. Wy|cherley's
illne&s;s, and 'tis to his being long indi&s;pos'd
that I partly attribute his chagrin. I wi&s;h he may
enjoy all the happine&s;s he de&s;ires, tho' he has been
the occa&s;ion of my enjoying much le&s;s than I did
formerly. I look upon your kindne&s;s to me as doubly
engaging at this time, and &s;hall never cea&s;e to ac|knowledge
it, or to profe&s;s my&s;elf,</P>

<OPENER>DEAR MR. POPE,</OPENER>
<P>I Intend to &s;ee the Doctor and the
Duke this evening, having &s;ent &s;everal expre&s;&s;es to
fix a meeting, that I may put you out of your pain:
perhaps I ought not to let you know that I &s;u&s;pect
the Doctor's punctuality as a practi&s;ing phy&s;ician;
be&s;ides the common uncertainty from the pre&s;ent
&s;ituation of this world, in which we have a &s;mall
&s;hare. The very weather is di&s;couraging, and &s;eems
in contradiction to a journey of plea&s;ure. The
Duke will have the advantage of us prodigiou&s;ly by
his loving a bottle, which is alike grateful at all
&s;ea&s;ons. But what &s;hall we do when we can neither
ride nor walk? About 11 at night I may be more
<PB N="140" REF="146">
po&s;itive, and defer &s;ealing till then. I am ju&s;t going
to <HI>Vertue,</HI> to give the la&s;t hand to that enterprize
which is our concern. He has done the King from
Kneller, but &s;o wretchedly, that I can &s;carcely ima|gine
how bad the picture mu&s;t be from which that
arti&s;t has perform'd &s;o poorly; but it is like and
ruefull. Two fanns you &s;hall have, and you &s;hall
pay for 'em in money if you think that way be&s;t. If
we &s;et out I will take care of &s;ending your baggage
beforehand.</P>
<P>I am this minute come from the Doctor who &s;eems
ready to mount, but the weather is &s;o extravagant
that there mu&s;t be a day or two of fair, for prepara|tion
to make the way tolerable over head and under

<LETTER>
<HEAD>Extract from a Letter of Mr. CIBBER to Mr. POPE, publi&s;hed in the Year 1742.</HEAD>
<P>&startq;The Play of The Rehear&s;al, which had lain &s;ome few years dormant, being by his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty (then Prince of Wales) commanded to be revived, the part of Bays fell to my &s;hare. To this character there had always been allow'd &s;uch ludicrous liberties of ob&s;er|vation, upon any thing new, or remarkable, in the &s;tate of the Stage, as Mr. Bays might think proper to take. Much about this time then, the <HI>Three Hours after Marriage</HI> had been acted without &s;ucce&s;s; when Mr. Bays, as u&s;ual, had a fling at it, which, in it&s;elf, was no je&s;t, unle&s;s the audience would plea&s;e to make it one: but however, flat as it was, Mr. Pope was mortally &s;ore upon it. This was the offence. In this Play, two cox|combs, being in love with a learned virtuo&s;o's wife, to get un&s;u&s;pected acce&s;s to her, ingeniou&s;ly &s;end them|&s;elves, as two pre&s;ented rarities, to the hu&s;band, the one curiou&s;ly &s;wath'd up like an Egyptian Mummy, and the other &s;lily cover'd in the Pa&s;te-board &s;kin of a Crocodile: upon which poetical expedient, I, Mr. Bays, when the two Kings of Brentford came from the clouds into the throne again, in&s;tead of what my part directed me to &s;ay, made u&s;e of the&s;e words, viz. Now, Sir, this revolution, I had &s;ome thoughts of in|troducing, by a quite different contrivance; but my de&s;ign taking air, &s;ome of your &s;harp wits, I found, had made u&s;e of it before me; otherwi&s;e I intended to have &s;tolen one of them in, in the &s;hape of a <HI>Mummy,</HI> and t'other, in that of a <HI>Crocodile.</HI>&endq; Upon which, &startq;I doubt, the audience by the roar of their applau&s;e &s;hew'd their proportionable contempt of the Play they belong'd to. But why am I an&s;werable for that? I did not lead them, by any reflection of my own, into that contempt: &s;urely to have u&s;ed the bare word <HI>Mummy,</HI> and <HI>Crocodile,</HI> was neither unju&s;t, or unman|nerly; where then was the crime of &s;imply &s;aying there had been two &s;uch things in a former Play? but this, it &s;eems, was &s;o heinou&s;ly taken by Mr. Pope, that, in the &s;welling of his heart, after the Play was over, he came behind the &s;cenes, with his lips pale and his voice trembling, to call me to account for the in&s;ult: and accordingly fell upon me with all the &s;oul language, that a wit out of his &s;en&s;es could be capable of&mdash;How dur&s;t I have the impudence to treat any gentleman in that manner? &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Now let the reader judge by this concern, who was the true mother of the child! when he was almo&s;t choked with the foam of his pa&s;&s;ion, I was enough recover'd from my amazement to make him (as near as I can remember) this reply, viz.&endq; &startq;&startq;Mr. Pope&mdash;You are &s;o particular a man, that I mu&s;t be a&s;ham'd to return your language as I ought to do: but &s;ince you have attacked me in &s;o mon&s;trous a manner; this you may depend upon, that as long as the Play continues to be acted, I will never fail to repeat the &s;ame words over and over again.&endq;</P>
