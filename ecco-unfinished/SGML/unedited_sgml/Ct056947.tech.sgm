<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Greate&s;t, if not the only
Effectual Service that can be
done a People under the Pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of Popular Mi&s;takes,
is to &s;et before them in a
Clear Light, a True and Im|partial
State of their own Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>The only Rea&s;on why this is &s;o &s;eldom done,
is from the natural Aver&s;ion Men have to
hear of their Mi&s;takes, and that general Di&s;|couragement
which Authors that hone&s;tly un|dertake
this Work meet with from the People
they &s;o faithfully &s;erve.</P>
<P>If this Humour continues on one Side, or
that partial Temper on the other, this Book
will have few Friends, nor will the Author be
di&s;appointed in it; he cannot be &s;uppos'd &s;o
ignorant as not to know that every Party who,
find their Errors reproved, however they are
convinced of the Truth of the Remark, will
be di&s;plea&s;ed with the Hand that &s;eems to
<PB REF="5">
uncover the Nakedne&s;s they w$ould rather
hide than reform.</P>
<P>This Error, however, is no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary
to be cur'd than the Mi&s;takes them&s;elves;
for the re&s;olv'd Way we take of Cheri&s;hing
our Follies, and Re&s;i&s;ting the Conviction of
our Rea&s;on, as al&s;o of Rejecting the Attempts
made by others; to Convince our Rea&s;on, is
the mo&s;t fatal Error of the Time, as it locks
up our Vice from the Reach of the wi&s;e&s;t
Animadver&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Author of this has, however, ventur'd
thro' all the&s;e Barricadoes, and the Fortifi|cations
of Popular Re&s;entment, and has made
the whole Work an E&s;&s;ay at a Friendly Re|proof
to tho&s;e who&s;e Reformation he wi&s;hes,
not their De&s;truction, There is not a Word
in the whole Work that looks Satyrical, but
it is either pointed at tho&s;e who are &s;o far
from being curable by common Methods, that
they are grown harden'd enough to boa&s;t of
their Mi&s;takes, or to tho&s;e who&s;e Partiality to
them&s;elves renders all other Ways effectual.</P>
<P>Satyr, like Inci&s;ion, becomes nece&s;&s;ary when
the Humour ranckles, and the Wound threat|ens
Mortification: When Advice cea&s;es to
not convinice, Satyr, then reforms by making
$wore$ Error we embrace ridiculous, Shame
<PB REF="6">
works to make us for&s;ake a Thing which
In&s;truction, Argument, or Per&s;wa&s;ion could
have no Effect upon.</P>
<P>This re&s;pects that Part of the following
Tract which points at the Di&s;&s;enters, as to
the Breeding up, Management of, and Be|haviour
towards their Mini&s;ters. If any
plau&s;ible Objection lies again&s;t this, it &s;eems
to be what the Author fore&s;ees from &s;ome
Well-wi&s;hers, who, tho' Owning the Fact, cry
out, <HI>The&s;e are unhappy Truths, but it is
Pity they &s;hould be told, it is Pity the
Folly of the</HI> Di&s;&s;enters &s;hould be made &s;o
<HI>Publick.</HI> To which the An&s;wer is very plain
and &s;hort.</P>
<P>It is Pity there &s;hould be a Nece&s;&s;ity for
making it &s;o publick. The&s;e Sheets have
been written above Eight Years, and the Au|thor
in Hopes that, <HI>fir&s;t</HI> or <HI>la&s;t,</HI> the Di&s;&s;ent|ers
would &s;ee their Impending Ruin, and re|move
the unhappy Cau&s;e, has waited and for|born
to &s;peak in this Dilect to them; he has,
on many Occa&s;ions, &s;eriou&s;ly, tho' privately,
repre&s;ented the Ca&s;e to many of the mo&s;t emi|nent
among the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> whom he has al|ways
found Lamenting the Di&s;temper, but
De&s;pairing of the Cure: He no-vu finds the
Circum&s;tances of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> come to a
Cri&s;is, they mu&s;t take new Mea&s;ures, or &s;ink
under the Feet of their Enemies; and he is
<PB REF="7">
convinc'd now is the Time when they ought
to be alarm'd, if any Thing will do it.</P>
<P>As to the Plaine&s;s and Cour&s;ene&s;s of the
Manner, he makes no Apology for it. Let
them that hate them, and wi&s;h their De|&s;truction,
flatter and cajole them in their Fol|lies,
to let them &s;leep on till they fall in the
Ruin of their own Negligence. He that
loves their Intere&s;t, will &s;peak plain Truth to
them, whether it plea&s;es them or no.</P>
<P><HI>The Enemies of the</HI> Di&s;&s;enters who wait
for their Fall, cry, Let them alone; thus
we would have, it; he that would &s;ave them
from Ruin, mu&s;t tell them whither they
are Running, and if they will not hear,
they will have the more to reproach them|&s;elves
with hereafter, when they remember
that they have been told of it.</P>
<P>I am verily per&s;waded no other Objection can be rais'd again&s;t the following Sheets. I
grant the Sea&s;onablene&s;s of a Reproof is the
E&s;&s;ence of the In&s;tructive Part; the pre&s;ent
Ca&s;e has &s;o many vi&s;ible Tokens of Nece&s;&s;ity,
that I cannot but think it Sea&s;onable and
Nece&s;&s;ary: If any are of another Opinion, I
would be glad to hear them propo&s;e &s;ome
other Method which has not been try'd, by
which the good People might be made &s;en|&s;ible
of their Error, and brought to correct
<PB REF="8">
and reform it. As to tho&s;e who neither like
my Remedies, and yet propo&s;e none of their
own, this Di&s;cour&s;e is not directed to them, nor
do they merit any Regard.</P>
<P>Now is the Time for the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> to en|ter
upon new Mea&s;ures; now is the Time
for them to &s;et to Work, to rectify their for|mer
Mi&s;takes; their Enemies are powerful;
pretended Friends have proved Fal&s;e; and
have betray'd them, to the Overthrow of their
Civil Intere&s;t. But if they can be per&s;waded
to erect upon &s;olid Foundations, a Firm and
La&s;ting Scheme of a Religious <HI>Oeconomy,</HI>
the Building that &s;hall grow up &s;hall be &s;uch as
&s;hall make them Invincible on one Side, and
Formidable on the other. Now is the Time
for them to &s;tand upon their own Legs, and
be truly Independent; in which, by a &s;teady
and faithful Adhering to God and his Cau&s;e,
and E&s;pou&s;ing heartily all that do &s;o, they
will &s;oon find their Circum&s;tances recover,
and the Figure they make deffer from any
Thing they ever mede before: Their Reli|gious
Liberties will &s;tand upon a better Ba&s;is
than ever, and they will be in a better Con|dition
to &s;upport their Civil Liberties al&s;o.</P>
<P>If they are &s;till blinded by the &s;ame Delu&s;i|ons;
if their Illumination is not yet to be
brought to pa&s;s, no not by their Di&s;a&s;ters, it
<PB REF="9">
is a &s;ad Sign that their Sufferings are not
yet at an End.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of this Book being rather Hy&s;to|rical
than Matter of Ob&s;ervation, the Author
thinks it requires no Apology or Introduction,
but referrs the Reader to his own Memory
for many of the Particulars, the Story being
too Modern to need any other Authority for
the Truth of it.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The General Introduction, and Platform
of the whole Work; being a Scheme
of the PARTIES.</HEAD>
<P>_IT is not a Precept the mo&s;t
ea&s;ily under&s;tood of any in
the Bible, which the Ble&s;|&s;ed
Apo&s;tle St. <HI>Paul</HI> has left
upon Record, in the Book
of God. <HI>Rom.</HI> xii. 3. <HI>To
Think Soberly:</HI> The whole
Text may be u&s;eful to begin our Di&s;cour&s;e
with, as a Thing, the want of which is the
De&s;truction and Ruin of Mankind, whether
in his &s;ingle or complicated Circum&s;tance, and
is abundantly &s;o, in our Day, to the &s;everal
<PB N="2" REF="11">
Parties which, at this Time, divide this Un|happy
Nation; the whole Words are the&s;e,
<Q>To every Man among you, not to Think of
him&s;elf more highly than he ought to
Thinks but TO THINK SO|BERLY,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>To the breach of this Rule, I take leave to
&s;ay, We owe much of the Evil of <HI>Divi&s;ion,</HI>
and e&s;pecially the Breach of Charity that
&s;preads Over this Nation; and no Man can
do a greater piece of Service to the People,
on both Sides, than to In&s;truct them how to
<HI>think of them&s;elves.</HI></P>
<P>In pur&s;uit of this Work, tho' the Scheme
may be Long, yet it is evident that the Sub|ject
is &s;o Large, and the Extent of it &s;o Great,
that it will be requi&s;ite to &s;tudy as much
Brevity as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The Bu&s;ine&s;s of the&s;e Sheets is Compre|hended
in the&s;e few Words, an Endeavour
to give a clear View, to every Party, of the
True State of their Circum&s;tances, as they
re&s;pect them&s;elves, and as they re&s;pect one
another, that if &s;uch a Thing be yet remain|ing
in the Nature of Man, they may learn
to <HI>think of them&s;elves,</HI> and of one another,
as <HI>they ought to think.</HI>&mdash;The chief De&s;ign
is, to Examine the State of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enting
Intere&s;t,</HI> which I &s;hall do Hi&s;torically, and
join with it due Ob&s;ervations; and as the
<PB N="3" REF="12">
Intere&s;ts, Originals, and Views of the other
Parties, will nece&s;&s;arily come in the Way to
be treated of, in order to make the Story
coherent, and to bring the Parts to con&s;i&s;t
with one another, and all with the general
De&s;ign; &s;o we &s;hall, as Epi&s;odes to the Plan
of the Work, lead the Reader into mo&s;t of
the con&s;iderable Circum&s;tances of our pre|&s;ent
divided State in this Nation.</P>
<P>In order to a clear Under&s;tanding of Things
as we go, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to enter a lit|tle
into the Con&s;ideration of two general
Heads.</P>
<P>1. To give you a general View of the
pre&s;ent State of the Nation, as to Parties,
and as to the Divi&s;ion tho&s;e Parties have
now brought us to.</P>
<P>2. To bring up tho&s;e Parties from their
Original, and con&s;ider their &s;eperate Cir|cum&s;tances.</P>
<Q>After this it may be more to the Purpo&s;e
to fix upon the e&s;pecial Head which
this Book is de&s;ign'd to Treat of <HI>viz.</HI>
that Party, or Body of Men among us,
who we call <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> and the State
of their Circum&s;tances Pa&s;t, Pre&s;ent,
and in Pro&s;pect.</Q>
<P>The pre&s;ent State of the Nation may mo&s;t
perfectly and clearly be under&s;tood, without
<PB N="4" REF="13">
any &s;earch into Antiquity, other than by look|ing
back to the <HI>Late Revolution:</HI> The <HI>Er|rors</HI>
of <HI>Pa&s;t Reigns,</HI> the <HI>Rancour</HI> of the <HI>Civil-War,</HI>
the <HI>Fury</HI> of the <HI>Re&s;toration,</HI> the <HI>Intri|gues</HI>
of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. and the <HI>Jehu Dri|vings</HI>
of King <HI>James</HI> II. all had their Periods
here: To repeat them a little at length.</P>
<P>The <HI>Rancour of the Civil-War ended here,</HI>
Tho&s;e Fe&s;tred Wounds of the State, which
had been too &s;everely &s;earch'd into by the <HI>Old
Parliament</HI> Times; but being too ha&s;tily
&s;kin'd over in the Tran&s;ports of the <HI>Re&s;tora|tion,</HI>
began to bleed a fre&s;h, and appear'd ready
to break forth again. The <HI>Impo&s;itions, Ex|travagancies,</HI>
Trampling on <HI>Laws,</HI> Oppre&s;|&s;ing
of <HI>Subjects,</HI> Invading <HI>Property,</HI> Per&s;ecu|ting
for <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> and Su&s;pending the <HI>Laws,</HI>
being the &s;ame as before, and the <HI>Subject's</HI>
Grievances were founded on the &s;ame <HI>Que&s;ti|ons</HI>
which were di&s;puted, and <HI>Complaints</HI>
which were granted by the <HI>Petition of Right:</HI>
The Years 1637 to 1641 were all acted over
again in the Wicked, but more Politick Reign
of <HI>Charles</HI> II, and the Fury of <HI>Civil-War</HI> it
&s;elf began to revive in the Popi&s;h and Tyran|nical
Government of King <HI>James</HI> II.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Revolution</HI> heal'd all the&s;e Di|&s;tempers;
and the Gangreen'd Member be|ing
Cut off from the Body, the <HI>Amputation</HI>
left the Body, as every one thought, and
expected, perfectly Sound, Healthy and Com|pleat.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="14">
It was not the lea&s;t Article of the Health
of the Body Politick, that the <HI>Seeds of Strife</HI>
which, for many Years, had been Sown
among us, on Account of <HI>Religious Matters,</HI>
&s;eem'd to be entirely Rooted out. A gene|ral
<HI>Charity</HI> growing up in the Place of river|ted
<HI>Bitterne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Religious Strife;</HI> good
Men promi&s;ed them&s;elves a rich Harve&s;t of
Pro&s;perity to the Commonwealth. The
<HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> had been the Handle, for many
Years, by which the Politicians had taken
hold of our <HI>Properties;</HI> and taken Advan|tages
to introduce all the &s;everal Methods
of <HI>Arbitrary Government.</HI> The &s;uppre&s;&s;ing
the&s;e, as dangerous Enemies to the State, had
been the Pretence for <HI>Per&s;cutions, Pro&s;ecu|tions,
Quo-warranto's,</HI> and all kinds of <HI>Oppre&s;|&s;ion.</HI>
The&s;e Things were carry'd to that
Height, and &s;uch pernitious U&s;e was made
of the <HI>Penal-Laws</HI> again&s;t <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> that
they grew Odious, even to the <HI>Church-men</HI>
them&s;elves: Men of Charity could not &s;ee
the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> drag'd out of their Hou&s;es and
Meetings to the Courts of <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> and the
Goals fill'd with their Neighbours, of the
be&s;t Credit and Trade, meerly for Wor&s;hip|ping
God in their own Way, without Infi|nite
di&s;like and regret; Men of <HI>Liberty</HI> and
<HI>Property</HI> could not, without abhorrence, &s;ee
the Spoil made of Men's E&s;tates by Laws
again&s;t <HI>Popery.</HI> The&s;e Things brought the
<HI>Moderate Church-men,</HI> and Lovers of <HI>Liberty,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="15">
to e&s;pou&s;e even the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> who they
called <HI>Schi&s;maticks,</HI> and oppo&s;e the Ravages
made upon their <HI>E&s;tates</HI> and <HI>Liberties,</HI> not
for the Sake of their <HI>Di&s;&s;enting,</HI> which they
did not approve of, but for the Sake of tho&s;e
<HI>Liberties</HI> and <HI>Priviledges</HI> which they en|joy'd
in Common with them, and which
they thought them&s;elves obliged to Pre|rerve:&mdash;
And in this Conjunction of <HI>Church|men</HI>
and <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> began the Name of
<HI>Whigg,</HI> a Word of Contempt, and fetch'd
from <HI>Scotland,</HI> where it &s;ignify'd a People
famous for their Oppo&s;ition to the En|croachments
of the Crown, tho', as they
repre&s;ented them, mingled with <HI>Enthu&s;i|a&s;ms</HI>
and <HI>Religious Madne&s;s;</HI> of which more
hereafter.</P>
<P>All this, as before, &s;eem'd bury'd in the
Toleration of <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> granted by Parlia|ment
after the <HI>Revolution,</HI> Act 1. <HI>William</HI> and
<HI>Mary,</HI> Cap. xviii.&mdash;and entituled, <HI>An Act to Ex|empt
their Maje&s;ties</HI> Prote&s;tant <HI>Subjects from
the Penalty of certain Laws, &amp;c.</HI>&mdash;I men|tion
the Title, becau&s;e of the Di&s;pute which
followed in the Proce&s;s of the&s;e Things
again&s;t this Act, being deem'd an <HI>Act of To|leration,</HI>
and of which I &s;hall &s;peak more
largely in its Place.</P>
<P>During the Reign of King <HI>William,</HI> the
Spirit of Jealou&s;y, laid a&s;leep (as I have &s;aid)
by the <HI>Revolution,</HI> continu'd quiet, and the
Differences in Religious Matters &s;eemed to
<PB N="7" REF="16">
carry no Weight in them &s;ufficient to di&s;turb
the Government, or the Minds of the Peo|ple.
The King, by Principle of an exten|&s;ive
Charity, and profe&s;s'dly aver&s;e to all
Coertion, not only forwarded the Act of
<HI>Toleration,</HI> which, as above, was granted to
<HI>Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> but u&s;ed his Endea|vour
to have render'd it more compleat, by
Turning the Edge of the Act E&s;tabli&s;hing
the Taking the <HI>Sacrament,</HI> as a Te&s;t of Pre|ferment,
from the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> to the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI>
only, according to the true Original and
De&s;ign both of the Law it&s;elf, and of tho&s;e
that made it, <HI>but</HI> Sathan <HI>hindred,</HI> for the King
&s;oon &s;aw that it might be &s;aid of the Spi|rit
of the <HI>High-Church</HI> Party, as it was of
<HI>Lazarus, That he is not Dead, but Sleepeth;</HI>
and that however &s;uppre&s;s'd by the <HI>Revo|lution,</HI>
and reduc'd to a Temper with the
<HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> (for the Sake of their having a&s;|&s;i&s;ted
in the Depo&s;ing-King <HI>James,</HI> and
fu&s;ing the Care&s;&s;es he made to them, in
Order to draw them, in to &s;upport him
again&s;t them, the Church) yet that they
would all take Fire again, if touch'd in
this &s;en&s;ible Part; that they e&s;teem'd this
<HI>Te&s;t-Act</HI> as a Pale about the Church, and
the Repealing it, as an Attempt to let in
the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> to trample it under Foot;
the King, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> finding the <HI>Church-men</HI>
alarm'd at the very Motion, and his Ma|je&s;ty
being not willing to lay the Foun|dation
<PB N="8" REF="17">
of new Divi&s;ions, or of reviving
the old Animo&s;ities, which were &s;o happily
bury'd, found him&s;elf oblig'd to drop the
Thing, and de&s;i&s;t from Declaring him&s;elf
too plainly in any Affair, which mu&s;t have
embroil'd him with one Part of the Nation
in Favour of another Part, who, however
Numerous and Rich, were not able to carry
him thro' it.</P>
<P>However, I have nam'd this as well to
record the Attempt that Glorious Prince
made at Rooting out the very Remains of
<HI>Per&s;ecution</HI> among us, as to note, that this
was the fir&s;t Occa&s;ion on which the High|Church-Men
&s;hew'd, that they had not bu|ry'd
their Animo&s;ities and Aver&s;ions to the
<HI>Di&s;&s;enters;</HI> only laid them a&s;leep 'till they
might find a more proper Occa&s;ion to di&s;|cover
them to their Advantage.</P>
<P>The Steps the King took in this Matter
were but few, however, they were &s;uch as
te&s;tify'd both his Sen&s;e of the Faithfulne&s;s
of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> to the Publick Intere&s;t, and
the ju&s;t Weight they ought to bear in the
State: His Maje&s;ty had propo&s;ed it to the
Per&s;ons whom he mo&s;t tru&s;ted at that
Time, and had u&s;ed &s;ome Arguments to
bring over &s;ome of them to be willing, yet
found many aver&s;e to it, tho&s;e who ap|pear'd
willing, yet di&s;&s;waded him from th$
Attempt, as what would create him great
Difficulties at a Time when his other Af|fairs
requir'd a general Compo&s;ure; and, in
<PB N="9" REF="18">
&s;hort, the Generality of the Council ap|pear'd
not well enclin'd to joyn in it; yet
the King's Rea&s;ons prevailed, and it was
agreed, That his Maje&s;ty &s;hould move it to
the Parliament, which he did, in his Speech
to Both Hou&s;es, on the 16th of <HI>March,</HI> 1689,
immediately after the happy Settlement of
the Crown: His Maje&s;ty's Words are the&s;e,
<Q><P>I know you are &s;en&s;ible there is a Nece&s;&s;ity
of &s;ome Law to &s;ettle the Oaths to be taken by
all Per&s;ons, to be admitted to &s;uch Places: I
recommend it to your Care to make a &s;peedy
Provi&s;ion for it; and as I doubt not but you
will &s;ufficiently provide again&s;t Papi&s;ts, &s;o I
hope you will leave room for the Admi&s;&s;ion of all
Prote&s;tants that are able and willing to &s;erve.</P>
<P>This Conjunction in my Service will tend to
the better Uniting you amongst your &s;elves, and
the Strengthening you again&s;t your Common
Adver&s;aries.</P></Q></P>
<P>But the <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> of <HI>Commons,</HI> fir'd at the
Propo&s;als, and &s;ome warm Speeches were
made within Doors, as well as Reflections
without Doors, all which I &s;hall bury in
this brief Hint, that the King, finding it was
not a proper Time for it, pro&s;ecuted it no
farther, and &s;o it died of it&s;elf.&mdash;The War,
and the various Hurries of the Time, put
the Remembrance of it off, and the <HI>Di&s;&s;en|ters</HI>
receiv'd no Injury from the Sugge&s;tion.</P>
<P>But tho' the making them ea&s;y by a Law
<PB N="10" REF="19">
could not thus be obtain'd, yet, as I noted
before, throughout this King's whole Reign
the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> receiv'd all the Favour and
Encouragement they could expect; they were
frequently po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of Po&s;ts of con&s;iderable
Profit and Tru&s;ts, and Commi&s;&s;ions of all
Sorts were put into their Hands. If they did
conform Occa&s;ionally, as I &s;hall have Time
to enquire in the farther Pro&s;ecution of this
Affair, <HI>Well and Good:</HI> But tho&s;e who did
not, found no Di&s;advantage in it; nor was
any &s;o forward as to pro&s;ecute the Law in
that Ca&s;e, knowing, that altho' the King
would not have &s;o far concern'd him&s;elf as
to grant <HI>Noli pro&s;equi</HI> in &s;uch Ca&s;es again&s;t a
due Proceeding at Law, yet that all other
Di&s;couragements would be given to it, and
the Per&s;ons marked as particularly forward
to di&s;plea&s;e the Government, and oppo&s;e
the healing De&s;igns of the King.</P>
<P>Whether this was the Cau&s;e or no, I will
not affirm; but this is certain, that no Man
ever receiv'd any Di&s;turbances of this Na|ture
during the Reign of King <HI>William;</HI> and
yet it might, with &s;ome A&s;&s;urance, be en|quired
of any of tho&s;e who are now &s;o for|ward
to lay the whole Weight of the
<HI>Church</HI>'s Safety upon this Act, what In|jury
the <HI>Church</HI> received by that Lenity?
Or in what Particular the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> could be
&s;aid to make any Encroachment, or Inva&s;ion,
upon the <HI>Church</HI> during that Time? On
<PB N="11" REF="20">
the contrary, I believe it may ea&s;ily be de|mon&s;trated,
that the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Di&s;&s;ent|ers</HI>
many Ways lo&s;t Ground by their own
Way of Improving the <HI>Liberty</HI> and <HI>Ea&s;e</HI>
they enjoy'd; of which in its Place.</P>
<P><HI>As to Parties:</HI> Then the Divi&s;ion, through|out
this whole Reign, lay chiefly between
the <HI>Jacobite</HI> and the <HI>Williamite: Whigg</HI>
and <HI>Tory,</HI> tho' Names of too general U&s;e
among us, even then, yet &s;ignify'd little
more than what they ought to &s;ignify now,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) the <HI>Friends</HI> and the <HI>Enemies</HI> of the
<HI>Revolution.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, towards the latter End of his
Maje&s;ty's Reign, a Court and Country Fac$i|on
got into our Management, and great
Heats, Turnings in, and Turnings out, fol|low'd
upon it; together with &s;everal Cla&s;h|ings
of a Party with the King about Di&s;po|&s;ing
the Forfeited E&s;tates in <HI>Ireland,</HI> Re-a&s;||&s;umtions
of Grants, Di&s;banding of Forces,
and the like, in which, Matters of Religion
had no Manner of Concern, and both <HI>Di&s;|&s;enters</HI>
and <HI>Church-men</HI> were found on both
Sides; only with this ju&s;t Ob&s;ervation in Fa|vour
of <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> that, generally Speaking,
they always adher'd to the King.&mdash;They
thought the Heat with which tho&s;e People
pu&s;h'd at his Maje&s;ty for the Di&s;po&s;ing of
the Forfeited E&s;tates unkind, becau&s;e of the
Merit of the Per&s;ons to whom the Grants
were made; the ju&s;t Claim they had to his
<PB N="12" REF="21">
Maje&s;ty's Bounty; and the Equity of giving
them their Rewards out of the Spoil of that
Country they had &s;pent &s;o much Blood, and
hazarded &s;o much to Reduce: They thought
it ungrateful that the Oppo&s;ition the King
made to the Disbanding the Army (which,
however, was with a Kind of Submi&s;&s;ion,
even to his own Subjects, a Thing unu&s;ual
from the Throne) &s;hould be charg'd on the
King's Principles, as if de&s;igning to Rule by
an Army; and that after all he had done to
&s;ave us from <HI>Tyranny,</HI> that we &s;hould &s;ug|ge&s;t
a De&s;ign in his Maje&s;ty to <HI>En&s;lave</HI> us:
Nor was the King him&s;elf altogether un|concern'd
at the Attempt of that Nature,
which he found went a great Way among
the People, and therefore, when he came to
Pa&s;s the Bill, he expre&s;s'd him&s;elf, for that
Purpo&s;e, in his Speech to the Parliament, in
the following Words:</P>
<P>I Came to Pa&s;s the Bill for Di&s;banding the
Army as &s;oon as I under&s;tood it was ready
for me.</P>
<P>Tho', in our pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances, there
appears great Hazard in breaking &s;uch a
Number of the Troops; and tho' I might think
my &s;elf unkindly u&s;ed, that tho&s;e Guards who
came over with me to your A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and have
con&s;tantly attended me in all the Actions
wherein I have been engaged, &s;hould be re|moved
from me, yet it is my fix'd Opinion,
<PB N="13" REF="22">
That nothing can be &s;o fatal to us, as, that
any Di&s;tru&s;t or Jealou&s;ie &s;hould ari&s;e between
me and my People, which I mu&s;t own would
have been very unexpected, after what I have
Undertaken, Ventured, and Acted, for the
Re&s;toring and Securing of their Liberties.</P>
<P>And here I cannot omit to ob&s;erve, how
ju&s;t the Retaliations of Heaven are, even in
Directing the Inju&s;tices and Ingratitudes of
Men, &s;o as that they may read their Sin in
their Puni&s;hment, and tho&s;e who have dealt
ungratefully and unju&s;tly by their Bene|factors
frequently arrive to a Time, as &s;ome
are &s;aid to do now, when they fall by the
Ingratitude and Inju&s;tice of tho&s;e they have
mo&s;t effectually $word$.</P>
<P>In this Po&s;ture Affairs &s;tood at the Death.
of that excellent Prince, and I have the
rather nam'd the&s;e Things, tho' they &s;eem
a Digre&s;&s;ion, that tho&s;e who look back into
tho&s;e Times, and compare them with the
Pre&s;ent, may know at what Epocha to begin
their Reckoning, from what Account of Time,
and from what Period to date the Events
which may take up &s;o much Room in the
Hi&s;tories of the&s;e Times.</P>
<P>The King Dying about this Time, more
mortally wounded with the pointed Rage of
Divided Parties, and an Ungrateful People,
than by the Di&s;location of his Shoulder, or
Collar-Bone, by the Fall from his Hor&s;e,
<PB N="14" REF="23">
was &s;ucceeded by our Pre&s;ent Queen the
Eighth of <HI>March,</HI> 170 1/2; and no &s;ooner was
Her Maje&s;ty Seated in the Throne, no
&s;ooner had She taken the Admini&s;tration into
Her Hands, but the Dead Mon&s;ters reviv'd,
and, like <HI>Cadmus</HI>'s Field, all the Bones of
the Slaughter'd Furies &s;tood up in Bands of
Armed Men.</P>
<P>In an unhappy Hour the Queen, in Her
Speech to Her fir&s;t Parliament, at the
End of the Se&s;&s;ion, expre&s;e'd Her&s;elf
(however, not Imagining the evil U&s;e that
would be made of it) with a True and
Sincere Zeal for the <HI>Church of England,</HI>
a&s;&s;uring them of Her e&s;pecial Favour, and
that tho&s;e who were mo&s;t Zealous for the
&s;aid Church &s;hould have the greate&s;t Share
in Her Maje&s;ty's Concern, as follows:</P>
<P>I &s;hall always wi&s;h, that no Difference of
Opinion among tho&s;e that are equally affec|ed
to my Service, may be the occa&s;ion of Heats
and Animo&s;ities among them&s;elves: I &s;hall be
very careful to Pre&s;erve and Maintain the
<HI>Act of Toleration,</HI> and to &s;et the Minds of all
my People at quiet: My own Principle mu&s;t
always keep me entirely firm to the Intere&s;ts
and Religion of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> and
will incline me to Countenance tho&s;e who have
The true&s;t Zeal to &s;upport it.</P>
<P>It is not the fir&s;t Time that this mi&s;-inter|preted
<PB N="15" REF="24">
Word ZEAL has been taken in a
wrong Sen&s;e in the World. And, not to di|gre&s;s
upon the evil Con&s;equences which, in
all Ages, have attended the Mi&s;-con&s;truction
of this Word, never was it taken in a wor&s;e
Sen&s;e, or apply'd to a wor&s;e U&s;e, and more
remote to the Intention of the Per&s;on Speak|ing
it, than on this Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Clergy, e&s;pecially, taking hold of it,
would neither give Leave, or Time, for any
Body, no not for the Queen Her&s;elf, to make
any other Explications, than &s;uch as they, for
the Ends which afterwards appear'd, thought
fit to make; but, making the Queen's
Words &s;peak their Meaning, they began to
Open, and rais'd a mo&s;t unaccountable Hur|ricane
in the Nation, letting the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI>
know that their Day was come; that their
Reign was at an End; that now they had a
<HI>Church of England</HI> Queen; and the Church
would re-a&s;&s;ume Her Dignity and Superiori|ty;
that She would no more be in&s;ulted by
<HI>Schi&s;maticks</HI> and <HI>Phanaticks;</HI> that Her Ma|je&s;ty
was the True <HI>Defender</HI> of the <HI>Church;</HI>
and, that She had recommended to them a
<HI>Zealous Concern</HI> for the Intere&s;t of the
<HI>Church;</HI> and they would not let &s;lip the
Occa&s;ion; they publickly declared, that <HI>Zeal</HI>
for the Intere&s;t and Safety of the <HI>Church</HI>
could be capable of no other Con&s;truction,
but <HI>Zeal</HI> to pull down the Pride and In&s;o|lence
of <HI>Schi&s;maticks;</HI> that the <HI>Church's</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="25">
Enemies mu&s;t be de&s;troy'd, and <HI>Faction</HI>
rooted out; and there could be no <HI>Zeal</HI> for
the <HI>Church,</HI> but &s;uch as con&s;i&s;ted in Ridding
Her, for ever, of the Fears of Her Enemies;
that the <HI>Church</HI> had no Enemies now in her
View but the <HI>Phanaticks;</HI> that the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI>
were &s;ufficiently fenc'd again&s;t by the <HI>Laws</HI>
and <HI>Aver&s;ions</HI> of the People to the Idolatry of
the <HI>Romi&s;h Wor&s;hip;</HI> but, that the <HI>Pre&s;byteri|ans</HI>
were a <HI>Viperous Brood,</HI> nouri&s;h'd in our
own Bowels, crept in within the Pale, and
who had taken Advantage of the Circum|&s;tances
of the Nation, under the late Admi|ni&s;trations,
to get a Kind of a Legal Admi&s;&s;i|on,
which they pretended to call an <HI>E&s;ta|bli&s;hment;</HI>
that, all along, under the Shadow
of this Lenity and Forbearance, they had
encroach'd on the very <HI>E&s;&s;ential Priviledges</HI>
of the <HI>Church,</HI> Sapping and Undermining
the Foundation of the <HI>Church of England;</HI>
and, that now was the Time to recover
them&s;elves when &s;upported by a True
<HI>Church of England</HI> Queen, Her Maje&s;ty al|&s;o
having invited them to it by Her mo&s;t
Gracious Speech, and with promi&s;es of
Her Favour and Affection.</P>
<P>With this, they forgot not to fill the
whole Nation with the mo&s;t &s;candalous,
odious, and unju&s;t Reflections upon the Per|&s;on
and Government of the Decea&s;ed King,
that could be devi&s;ed, Representing the Na|tion
as deliver'd from him; his Reign as
<PB N="17" REF="26">
fatal to the <HI>Church,</HI> and di&s;honourable to the
<HI>Kingdom;</HI> in Contempt of his Actions, and
of his Per&s;on, they form'd two <HI>By-Words,</HI> or
<HI>Proverbial Speeches,</HI> which, by the Populari|ty
of the reigning Di&s;temper of tho&s;e Times,
became <HI>Proverbial,</HI> and the <HI>Shiboleth</HI> of the
Day; I forbear to mention who they obtain'd
to &s;peak that Language, in Re&s;pect to one
Part, and in Pity to the other; e&s;pecially
now they are in a Way of like Treatment;
the&s;e <HI>By-Words</HI> were, <HI>a Heart entirely</HI> Eng|i&s;h,
and <HI>Retrieving the Nation's Honour;</HI>
&s;implying, that King <HI>William</HI> was not a Na|tive,
and that the Honour of the Nation had
&s;uffer'd in his Hands; but Heaven has
aveng'd his Memory in both the&s;e, and there|fore
I take no farther Notice of it here.</P>
<P>This Heat and Fury of the Clergy went
to that Height, that even it became ludi|crous,
and attended with all the little Ex|ce&s;&s;es
which a Per&s;on elevated beyond the
Government of him&s;elf, by &s;ome &s;uddain
Joy, is u&s;ually &s;ubject to; and as a known Au|thor
remarks, That upon the Re&s;toration of
King <HI>Charles</HI> II. the Exce&s;&s;es and Tran&s;ports
of the Clergy and People run out into Revels,
May-Poles, and all Manner of Extravagancies;
&s;o, at this time, there were more May-Poles
&s;et up in One Year, in <HI>England,</HI> than had been
in 20 Years before; Ballads for the <HI>Church</HI>
was another Expre&s;&s;ion of their <HI>Zeal,</HI>
wherein, generally, the <HI>Chorus,</HI> or Burthen
<PB N="18" REF="27" MS="Y">
of the Song, was, <HI>Down with the</HI> Pre&s;byteri|ans;
and to &s;uch a Height were Things
brought, that the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> began to be in|&s;ulted
in every Place; their <HI>Meeting-Hou&s;es</HI>
and <HI>A&s;&s;emblies</HI> a&s;&s;aulted by the Mob; and
even their <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> and <HI>Preachers</HI> were
&s;carce admitted to pa&s;s the Streets.</P>
<P>The Violences of the Day being but of a
&s;hort Continuance, I choo&s;e to bury them as
much as will con&s;i&s;t with the Connection of
the Thing, being unwilling to record more of
the Folly of tho&s;e Times than Nece&s;&s;ity ob|liges
me to: The re&s;t may a little be gue&s;s'd
at, by the famous Expre&s;&s;ion of that known
Malefactor <HI>Sacheverell,</HI> who fir&s;t made him|&s;elf
remarkable to the World on this Occa|&s;ion,
by a Sermon preach'd at <HI>Oxford,</HI> in
which he had an Expre&s;&s;ion to this Purpo&s;e,
<HI>That he could not be a True Son of the
Church of</HI> England <HI>who did not lift up the
Banner of the Church again&s;t the</HI> Di&s;&s;enters.</P>
<P>This was the Sermon upon which an
Author, till then not much known, wrote
that unhappy Book called, <HI>The &s;horte&s;t Way
with the</HI> Di&s;&s;enters.&mdash;In which, &s;eem|ing
to fall in with the Times, he urg'd, with
the mo&s;t pungent Reafons, and with utmo&s;t
&s;eeming Eagerne&s;s, the Ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of
Rooting out the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> from the Nation.</P>
<P>The wi&s;e&s;t <HI>Church-men</HI> in the Nation
were deceiv'd by; this Book; tho&s;e who&s;e
Temper fell in with the Times hugg'd and
<PB N="19" REF="28">
embrac'd it; applauded the Propo&s;al; fill'd
their Mouths with the Arguments made
U&s;e of therein; and an eminent <HI>Church-man,</HI>
in the <HI>Country,</HI> wrote a Letter to his Friend
in <HI>London,</HI> who had &s;ent him the Book, in
the following Words:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Receiv'd yours, and with it that Pamphlet
which makes &s;o much Noi&s;e, called, <HI>The</HI>
&s;horte&s;t Way with the Di&s;&s;entrers, for which
I thank you: I joyn with that Author in all
he &s;ays, and have &s;uch a Value for the Book,
that, next to the <HI>Holy Bible,</HI> and the <HI>Sacred
Comments,</HI> I take it for the mo&s;t valuable
Piece I have. I pray God put it into Her
Maje&s;ty's Heart to put what is there propo&s;ed
in Execution.</P>
<CLOSER>Yours, &amp;c.</CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>On the other Hand, the Soberer <HI>Church|men,</HI>]
who&s;e Principles were founded on
<HI>Charity,</HI> and who had their Eye upon the
<HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Con&s;titution</HI> of their Country, as
that to which their own <HI>Liberties</HI> were an|nex'd,
tho' they &s;till believed the Book to
be written by a <HI>High-Church-Man,</HI> yet open|ly
exclaim'd again&s;t the Propo&s;al, condemn'd
the Warmth that appear'd in the Clergy
again&s;t their Brethren, and openly profe&s;s'd,
that &s;uch Men as <HI>Sacheverell</HI> and his Bre|thren
<PB N="20" REF="29">
would blew up the Foundations of
the <HI>Church.</HI></P>
<P>But either Side had &s;carce Time to di&s;co|ver
their Sentiments, when the Book ap|pear'd
to have been written by a <HI>Di&s;&s;enter;</HI>
that it was de&s;ign'd in Deri&s;ion of the Stan|dard
held up by <HI>Sacheverell</HI> and others; that
it was a Satyr upon the Fury of the <HI>Church|men,</HI>
and a Plot to make the re&s;t di&s;cover
them&s;elves; nothing was more &s;trange than to
&s;ee the Effect upon the whole Nation which
this little Book, a contemptible Pamphlet
of but three Sheets of Paper, had, and in &s;o
&s;hort a Time too; the mo&s;t Forward, Hot,
and Furious, as well among the Clergy as
others, blu&s;h'd when they reflected how far
they had applauded the Book; raged that
&s;uch an Abu&s;e &s;hould be put upon the
<HI>Church;</HI> and as they were obliged to damn
the Book, &s;o they were &s;trangely hamper'd
between the doing &s;o, and pur&s;uing their
Rage at the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters;</HI> the greater Part,
the better to qualify thera&s;elves to condemn
the Author, came earne&s;tly in to condemn
tie Principle; for it was impo&s;&s;ible to do
one without the other.</P>
<P>They labour'd Ince&s;&s;antly, both in <HI>Print</HI>
and in <HI>Pulpit,</HI> to prove, That this was a hor|rible
Slander upon the <HI>Church,</HI> but this &s;till
an&s;wer'd the Author's End the more; for
they could never Clear the <HI>Church</HI> of the
Slander, without openly Condeming the
<PB N="21" REF="30">
Practice; nor could they po&s;&s;ibly Condemn
the Practice without Cen&s;uring the&s;e Cler|gymen,
who had gone &s;uch a length already,
as to &s;ay the &s;ame Thing in Print: Nor
could all their Rage at the Author of that
Book, contribute any thing to Clear them,
but &s;till made the Better Side the Wor&s;e. It
was plain they had own'd the <HI>Doctrine,</HI> had
preach'd up the Nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>Expelling,</HI> and
<HI>Rooting Out</HI> the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in their <HI>Sermons,</HI>
and Printed; that it was evident they had
applauded the Book it &s;elf, as before, till
they knew the Author; and there was no
other way to prevent the Odium falling on
the whole Body of the <HI>Church of England,</HI>
but by giving up the Authors of tho&s;e <HI>Mad
Principles,</HI> and openly profe&s;&s;ing <HI>Moderate
Principles</HI> them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The &s;evere U&s;age of the Author encreas'd
this Turn; they Fin'd him, Impri&s;on'd him,
Pillory'd him, and, indeed, Ruin'd him:
But his Contempt of them, even under all
his Sufferings, his <HI>Hymn to the Pillory,</HI> which
he made in Deri&s;ion of them, and publi&s;h'd
the very Day they expos'd him; the Shouts
of the People when he was taken down, and
the General Abhorrence &s;hown, as well
by <HI>moderate Church-men</HI> as <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> at the
Severities u&s;ed again&s;t him, all te&s;tify'd, that
the whole Nation had receiv'd a New Tin|cture,
and the furious Spirit, afore&s;aid, recei|ved
a vi&s;ible Check from this Accident, how|ever
<PB N="22" REF="31">
ever trifling in it &s;elf. But, that the Reader
may &s;ee this more plainly, by the Con&s;e|quences,
it is worth ob&s;erving. That the
Government, taking a right View of the
Stream of the Peoples Affections, and Her
Maje&s;ty, who&s;e Goodne&s;s naturally di&s;lik'd
the Violence of tho&s;e Spirits who were run|ning
Things to the&s;e Extreams, gave a full
Turn to the popular Humour.</P>
<P>The Men of <HI>Moderate Principles</HI> about
Her Maje&s;ty fell in with the Occa&s;ion, and
repre&s;enting how ill a U&s;e &s;ome People had
made of Her Maje&s;ty's Words, &s;oon con|vinc'd
Her Maje&s;ty, that the De&s;truction of
all Her <HI>Di&s;&s;enting Subjects</HI> was aim'd at;
which, as it was a Thought the Queen ab|horr'd,
&s;o, in Her next Speech to the Par|liament,
Her Maje&s;ty gave a publick Te&s;ti|mony
of Her di&s;like of tho&s;e Things; and,
on other Occa&s;ions, te&s;tify'd &s;ome wonder,
that any of Her Subjects &s;hould &s;o far mi&s;|take
Her Meaning, as to take Encourage|ment
from Her Words to widen the Breach
among Her <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Subjects, which was
&s;o well clo&s;ed, as to Affection and Int're&s;t, by
the <HI>Revolution</HI> and the <HI>Toleration;</HI> which
<HI>Toleration,</HI> Her Maje&s;ty expre&s;s'd, on all Oc|ca&s;ions,
Her re&s;olution to Maintain; and, to
put the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> out of all Pain, as to pri|vate
Encroachments on it, a&s;&s;ur'd them, in
another Speech, of Her re&s;olving to pre&s;erve
the <HI>Toleration,</HI> with the Word <HI>Inviolably:</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="32">
Inviting, and on all Occa&s;ions earne&s;tly pre&s;|&s;ing
Her Subjects to <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Union</HI> among
them&s;elves, as the only Way to keep them
Safe; to di&s;appoint their Enemies Abroad
and at Home, and to make them a Happy
People.</P>
<P>At the Opening the Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament
for the Year 1703, Her Maje&s;ty began the&s;e
Exhortations in the following Words:</P>
<P>I want Words to expre&s;s to you my ear|ne&s;t
De&s;ires of &s;eeing all my Subjects in per|fect
<HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Union</HI> among them&s;elves;
I have nothing &s;o much at Heart as their
general <HI>Wellfare</HI> and <HI>Happine&s;s;</HI> let Me,
therefore, de&s;ire you all, that you would
carefully avoid any <HI>Heats</HI> or <HI>Divi&s;ions</HI> that
may di&s;appoint me of that Satisfaction, and
give Encouragement to the Common Enemies
of our <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>State.</HI></P>
<P>Nor was this all: But as the Temper of
<HI>Moderation</HI> prevail'd at Court, &s;o was the
Gentlemen of <HI>Moderate Principles</HI> encourag|ed,
And, in a few Days, a Revolution at
Court, to the general Satisfaction of the Na|tion,
was effected, by di&s;placing the D&mdash;
of <HI>B</HI>&mdash;Lord <HI>P</HI>&mdash;<HI>S;</HI> the E&mdash;of
<HI>No</HI>&mdash;<HI>$am,</HI> Secretary of State; Sir <HI>Edward
Seymour,</HI> Comptroller of the Hou&s;hold, and
all their Adherents and Dependents; this
happen'd in the Month of <HI>April</HI> 1704.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="33">
Some People have blam'd the Author of
the afore&s;aid Pamphlet, called <HI>The Shorte&s;t
Way,</HI> &amp;c. for that he did not quote either
In the Margin, or otherwi&s;e the Sermon of
<HI>Sacheverell,</HI> afore&s;aid, or &s;uch other Authors
from whom his Notions were drawn, which
would have ju&s;tify'd him in what he had
&s;ugge&s;ted; but the&s;e Men do not &s;ee the
De&s;ign of the Book at all, or the Effect it
had on the People it pointed at: It is true,
this had prevented the Fate of the Man, but
it had, at the &s;ame Time, taken off the Edge
of the Book, and that which now cut the
Throat of a whole Party, would not then
have given the lea&s;t Wound. The Ca&s;e the
Book pointed at, was to &s;peak in the fir&s;t
Per&s;on of the <HI>Party,</HI> and then, thereby, not
only &s;peak their Language, but make them
acknowledge it to be theirs, which they did
&s;o openly, that confounded all their Attempts
afterwards to deny it, and to call it a <HI>Scan|dal</HI>
thrown upon them by another.</P>
<P>It cannot be deny'd here, without great
Inju&s;tice, That the pre&s;ent Lord Trea&s;ure,
then Mr. <HI>Harley,</HI> and Speaker of the <HI>Hou&s;e
of Commons,</HI> was the Principal Agent in
the introducing the&s;e <HI>Moderate,</HI> and <HI>Heal|ing
Councils;</HI> and in repre&s;enting to Her
Maje&s;ty, in behalf of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> the
ruinous De&s;igns form'd by a Party of Men
who would not only have involv'd Her
Maje&s;ty in a Trouble&s;ome and Ungrateful
<PB N="25" REF="34">
Breach with &s;o con&s;iderable a Body of Her
Subjects, but would have engag'd Her in a
bitter and furious <HI>Per&s;ecution</HI> for <HI>Con&s;cience
&s;ake,</HI> both, contrary to Her own Di&s;po&s;i|tion,
and contrary to the True Intere&s;t of
Her Kingdom; and if, when Her Maje&s;ty
came to be rightly inform'd of the&s;e Things,
it fill'd Her with a ju&s;t Indignation at the In|&s;truments,
it cannot be wonder'd at.</P>
<P>The happy Turn, as above, being given to
Affairs, the Face of all things alter'd imme|diately;
all the Attempts for an <HI>Occa&s;ional-Bill</HI>
made after this, mi&s;carry'd, and might
have done &s;o to this Day, had the Patriots of
the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> been True to their Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>That Bill, which was lo&s;t, the Year be|fore,
on a meer Nicety in the <HI>Hou&s;e of Com|mons,</HI>
and their in&s;i&s;ting on a Trifle, which
they would mo&s;t gladly have afterwards
given up, was the next Year Oppos'd by the
whole Court, and thrown Out of the Hou&s;e
by a great Majority.</P>
<P>Nor did Her Maje&s;ty only come in to the
moderate Schemes above, but to this Epoca
is referr'd the Time when the Lord Trea|&s;urer,
<HI>Go</HI>&mdash;<HI>phin,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Marl</HI>&mdash;<HI>h,</HI>
the Dutche&s;s, and many more, who during
the whole Reign of the late King, had been
on the other Side to an Extream, who were
always <HI>High-Church,</HI> and had been counted,
by &s;ome, among the <HI>wor&s;t Enemies</HI> the <HI>Di&s;&s;en|ters</HI>
had, came over, and became what from
<PB N="26" REF="35">
that Day, they were e&s;teem'd all over the
Nation, <HI>viz. Whiggs.</HI></P>
<P>This, afterwards, was &s;um'd up again&s;t
them, as a Reproach, when that unhappy
Breach came in among us, which laid the
foundation of the <HI>la&s;t Revolution</HI> at Court:
I mean, when, after the Di&s;placing Mr. Se|cretary
<HI>H</HI>&mdash;<HI>ly,</HI> the <HI>Juncto,</HI> or <HI>Whigg-Lords,</HI>
&s;et up again&s;t the <HI>Mini&s;try,</HI> that is, again&s;t
the Duke of <HI>M</HI>&mdash;<HI>gh,</HI> and the Trea&s;urer,
<HI>Go</HI>&mdash;<HI>phin;</HI> when the Di&s;tinction between
<HI>Old-Whigg</HI> and <HI>New-Whigg</HI> was fir&s;t brought
upon the Stage, and the Friends of the
<HI>Juncto</HI> threw this in the Teeth of the <HI>Mi|ni&s;try</HI>
as afore&s;aid, <HI>viz.</HI> That they were on|ly
<HI>Modern-Whiggs;</HI> that they were not
<HI>Whiggs</HI> from Principle, but Intere&s;t; that
they were <HI>Tories</HI> and <HI>High-Fliers</HI> in their
Original, and were &s;till &s;o in their Inclinati|on;
that they only e&s;pous'd the <HI>Whiggs</HI> now,
as that Intere&s;t that be&s;t &s;erv'd their Turn;
that they were all brought over by Mr.
<HI>H</HI>&mdash;<HI>ly,</HI> and would all return to their fir&s;t
Principles, when ever a like Occa&s;ion of|fer'd.
But this by the by.</P>
<P>In the pur&s;uit of the <HI>Moderate Councils</HI>
which now began to Govern, as above&s;aid,
&s;everal Great, Happy, and Succe&s;sful Steps
were taken in the <HI>Publick Affairs,</HI> both at
Home and Abroad, which, tho' they are
fre&s;h in the Memory of all that Read, or
take Notice of the <HI>Publick Affairs,</HI> yet, as
<PB N="27" REF="36">
all who may remember the Falls may not
have ob&s;erv'd the Connection between tho&s;e
<HI>Succe&s;&s;es</HI> Abroad, and the <HI>Mea&s;ures</HI> at Home,
and how a happy Series of the Fir&s;t attend|ed
the Wi&s;dom, Prudence, and Unanimity
of the la&s;t, it may not be ami&s;s, with great
Brevity, to review a few of the great Actions
of tho&s;e three or four Years, both Abroad
and at Home.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> was no &s;ooner out of the
Hands of the <HI>Tories,</HI> but the Scale turn'd
Abroad; the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> &s;eem'd
to have been a little check'd in his De&s;igns,
the Year before, by the Revolt of the Duke
of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and found the <HI>Confederates</HI> not
a little &s;urpriz'd at the rapid Course of the
<HI>French</HI> Conque&s;ts on the <HI>Rhine</HI> and the <HI>Da|nube.</HI>
The Mar&s;hal de <HI>Tallard</HI> had taken
<HI>Landau,</HI> and beaten the <HI>Imperial</HI> Army at
the Battle of <HI>Spierback,</HI> the Campaign be|fore;
ruining entirely the <HI>He&s;&s;ian</HI> and <HI>Pala|tine</HI>
Troops, and was now upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI>
with a <HI>Royal-Army,</HI> threatning to Ravage the
Circle of <HI>Franconia,</HI> and the County of
<HI>He&s;&s;ia;</HI> but chiefly with a De&s;ign to Em|barra&s;s
Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Baden,</HI> and the Im|periali&s;ts,
&s;o that they &s;hould not be able to
re&s;cue the Emperor, who, in the mean time,
was threatn'd by the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> to
be attack'd, even in his Capital of <HI>Vienna;</HI>
that Elector having already over-run <HI>Swa|bia;</HI>
taken the Imperial Cities of <HI>Ulm,
<PB N="28" REF="37">
Meminghen,</HI> and <HI>Kempen;</HI> ravag'd <HI>Tiroll,</HI> and
taken <HI>Pa&s;&s;au;</HI> and was preparing to attack
<HI>Lintz,</HI> and then <HI>Vienna.</HI> In this Exigence
of Affairs the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> by
Concert with the <HI>Dutch</HI> and the Emperor's
General, Prince <HI>Eugene of Savoy,</HI> agreed to
quit the Pur&s;uit of the War in <HI>Flanders;</HI>
leave Count <HI>Tallard</HI> with the <HI>French</HI> Army
on the <HI>Rhine</HI> at Liberty to undertake what
ever he thought fit; and with the Greate&s;t
and Be&s;t Army that has been &s;een in that
Part of the World, perhaps ever &s;een, took
that prodigious March into <HI>Bavaria,</HI> which,
ended in the famous Battle of <HI>Blenheim,
Augu&s;t</HI> the 2d. 1704, taking Count <HI>Tallard</HI>
Pri&s;oner, and entirely Expelling the Elector
of <HI>Bavaria</HI> out of his own Country, from
whence he continues an Exile to this
Day.</P>
<P>This was the fir&s;t vi&s;ible Ble&s;&s;ing on the
Arms of Her Maje&s;ty, after the happy
Change of Her Affairs at Home, as if Hea|ven
had re&s;olv'd to encourage a Nation new|ly
come to their <HI>Politick Sen&s;es;</HI> and who
were but beginning to take <HI>right Mea&s;ures</HI>
for making them&s;elves Great and Happy.</P>
<P><HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Union</HI> was no &s;ooner e&s;tabli&s;h'd
at Home, but <HI>Victory</HI> came in from Abroad,
and the Queen, in Conjunction with Her
<HI>New-Mini&s;try,</HI> encourag'd by this happy
Succe&s;s Abroad, pur&s;ues the &s;ame Advice
at Home; and, carrying on all Things by the
<PB N="29" REF="38">
&s;ame happy Mea&s;ures, repeats the pre&s;&s;ing
In&s;tances She had made before to Her next
Parliament, which met in <HI>November,</HI> That
they would Unite, and lay a&s;ide all Divi&s;i|ons
and Animo&s;ities among them&s;elves, as
the only Way to make them all Happy.
This you have at large in Her Speech to
Both Hou&s;es, <HI>October</HI> the 24th, 1704, as
follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>My Lords and Gentlemen,</OPENER>
<P>I Cannot but tell you how e&s;&s;ential it is for
attaining the&s;e great Ends Abroad, of
which we have &s;o hopeful a Pro&s;pect, that
we &s;hould be entirely United at Home.</P>
<P>'Tis plain our Enemies have no Encourage|ment
left but what ari&s;es from their Hopes of
our Divi&s;ions; 'tis, therefore, your Concern
not to give the lea&s;t Countenance to the&s;e
Hopes.</P>
<P>My Inclinations are to be Kind and Indulg|ing
to you all, I hope you will do nothing to
endanger the Lo&s;s of this Opportunity, which
$od hath put into our Hands, of Securing
Our&s;elves and all <HI>Europe;</HI> and that there
Will be no Contention among&s;t you; but who
&s;hall mo&s;t promote the Publick Wellfare.</P>
<P>Such a Temper as this, in all your Proceed|ings,
cannot fail of Securing your Reputations
both at Home and Abroad.</P>
<P>This would make Me a happy Queen, who&s;e
<PB N="30" REF="39">
utmo&s;t Endeavour &s;hall never be wanting to
make you a happy and flouri&s;hing People.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>The Hi&s;tory of the&s;e Things is not the
Bu&s;ine&s;s of this Tract, any farther, than, <HI>as
before,</HI> they concur to &s;hew how <HI>Victory</HI>
Abroad and <HI>Union</HI> at Home kept Pace, and
went Hand in Hand together; we &s;hall
have the Mortification, in its Turn, to tell
you, That as our <HI>Union</HI> and <HI>Peace</HI> at Home
decay'd, and wore out, &s;o our <HI>Succe&s;&s;es</HI> Abroad
fell off and declin'd.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Year, famous for the Battle of
<HI>Blenheim;</HI> the Conque&s;t of <HI>Bavaria;</HI> the Re|covering
all that was lo&s;t in the Circle of
<HI>Swabia,</HI> ended with the Re-Taking the
&s;trong Fortre&s;s of <HI>Landau;</HI> a Battle at Sea,
to our Advantage, in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI>
and with beginning the War in <HI>Spain</HI> under
King <HI>Charles</HI> III.</P>
<P>The next Year i&s;&s;ued with no <HI>Victory,</HI> or
great Action of Moment, yet the <HI>French</HI>
weakned by the Ruin of their Affairs in <HI>Ba|varia,</HI>
tho' they di&s;appointed the Confede|rates
on the <HI>Mo&s;elle,</HI> yet &s;uffer'd an equal
Di&s;appointment in their Enterprize on <HI>Ni|meguen,</HI>
and had their Lines forced at the
End of the Campaign.</P>
<P>But the Year 1706, as it was the Meridi|an
of our flouri&s;hing Affairs at Home, as to
<HI>Party, Peace,</HI> and <HI>Union</HI> of the People, &s;o it
was the mo&s;t glorious Year of <HI>Victory</HI> that the
<PB N="31" REF="40">
Confederates ever &s;aw, and the greate&s;t Year
of Lo&s;&s;es to <HI>France</HI> that ever any Empire in
the World could &s;uffer, and yet remain un|&s;ubdued;
for in the Beginning of this Year,
fir&s;t on <HI>May</HI>-Day, to begin the Year, the
Siege of <HI>Barcelona</HI> was Rai&s;ed by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Succours coming thither, under the Com|mand
of Two known Officers, the Earl of
<HI>Peterborow,</HI> and Sir <HI>John Lake,</HI> and the
Mare&s;chal <HI>de Te&s;&s;e</HI> oblig'd to make his Re|treat,
in a de&s;perate Manner, with the
<HI>French</HI> Army to <HI>Ro&s;es,</HI> leaving 150 Pieces
of Cannon and Mortars, 2500 Sick and
Wounded Men, and all his Ammunition
and Carriages behind him, Marching under
the particular Mortification of a very re|markable
Eclip&s;e of the Sun, which was pe|culiarly
vi&s;ible there; and the more Terri|fying
as the Sun in its Splendor is the De|vice
of the King of <HI>France,</HI> who&s;e Glory,
that Year, &s;uffer'd the greate&s;t Eclip&s;e that
had ever attended any Prince of this Age.</P>
<P>On the 12th of the &s;ame Month happen'd
the great Battle of <HI>Ramellies,</HI> in <HI>Flanders,</HI>
of which all our Hi&s;tories are full, wherein
the Flower of all <HI>France,</HI> as to Forces, fell
in the Field, and which was follow'd by
the Taking of almo&s;t all <HI>Flanders,</HI> the Cities
of <HI>Bru&s;&s;els, Bruges, Antwerp, Ghene, Ma|chlin,</HI>
and <HI>Lovain;</HI> the &s;trong Towns of
<HI>Oe&s;tend, Menin, Courtray, Oudenard, Alo&s;t,
Dendermond,</HI> and many more.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="41">
But, as if this had not been enough, the
Year ended with a Victory yet greater in its
Kind and Effects than all the&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> The
Battle of <HI>Turin,</HI> wherein the Duke of <HI>Orle|ans</HI>
was entirely overthrown, the Mare&s;chal
<HI>Mar&s;in</HI> killed, the Siege of <HI>Turin</HI> Rai&s;ed, the
whole <HI>French</HI> Army defeated, 11000 Dra|goons
Hor&s;es taken, 250 Pieces of Cannon
and Mortars, with all the Baggage, Tents,
Ammunition, Carriages, and Camp of the
<HI>French;</HI> and which Victory was follow'd
by the entire Lo&s;s of <HI>Italy</HI> by the <HI>French;</HI>
the Count <HI>de Medavy</HI> having capitulated to
quit all the Towns held in the Dutchy of
<HI>Milan,</HI> and on the <HI>Po,</HI> for Leave to with|draw
the <HI>French</HI> Troops out of <HI>Lombardy.</HI></P>
<P>It is not nay Bu&s;ine&s;s to de&s;cant here upon
the&s;e Great Things, but &s;till to ob&s;erve, That
this Meridian of our Victories Abroad was
ju&s;t in the Meridian of our <HI>Union</HI> at Home;
and, that as <HI>Victory</HI> crown'd thus our Arms,
<HI>Univer&s;al Satisfaction</HI> crown'd our <HI>Councils,</HI>
by Beginning and Compleating the greate&s;t
Tran&s;action at Home that ever was brought
to a Head in this Nation, I mean <HI>the Union
with</HI> Scotland, which the next Se&s;&s;ion of
Parliament had the Felicity to encourage,
and to &s;ee fini&s;hed,</P>
<Q><P>For it began in <HI>England,</HI> the 16th of <HI>April.</HI></P>
<P>Was ended there, and the Articles pre|&s;ented
to Her Maje&s;ty the 23d of <HI>July:</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="42">
Begun to be con&s;ider'd in the Parliament
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the 3d of <HI>October.</HI></P>
<P>The Ratification Perfected, Voted, Ap|prov'd,

and, with Amendments, &s;ent up to
the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> the 16th of
<HI>January.</HI></P>
<P>It pa&s;s'd the Parliament in <HI>England</HI> the
6th of <HI>March;</HI> and was pa&s;s'd by the
Queen the 19th of <HI>March.</HI></P>
<P>The Exemplification was &s;ent down to
<HI>Scotland,</HI> received there, and the la&s;t
Parliament of that Kingdom Di&s;&s;olved
the 28th of <HI>April,</HI> 1707.</P></Q>
<P>Happy would it be if I could &s;ay that our
<HI>Pro&s;perity</HI> Abroad, as our <HI>Union</HI> at Home,
did not begin from henceforth to decline;
and indeed they &s;eem'd in this, very much
to keep Pace, al&s;o, one with another. It is
true, the <HI>Succe&s;&s;es</HI> in <HI>Flanders,</HI> in &s;ome
Mea&s;ure continu'd, yet many <HI>Misfortunes</HI>
from other Parts, gave a Check to our <HI>Suc|ce&s;&s;es,</HI>
as the Beating back King <HI>Charles</HI> the
III's Army in <HI>Spain</HI> from <HI>Madrid,</HI> and the
Enemy Recovering all <HI>Ca&s;tile;</HI> the Couping
up the Earl of <HI>Galloway</HI> with his Forces in
the little Province (tho' called a Kingdom)
of <HI>Valentia;</HI> and, at la&s;t, the fatal Battle of
<HI>Almanza,</HI> where the Earl of <HI>Galway</HI> and the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Army, tho' re-inforc'd by a great
Body of Troops from <HI>England,</HI> under
<PB N="34" REF="43">
the Earl <HI>Rivers,</HI> were not only beaten, but
entirely routed, and broken by the Duke of
<HI>Berwick;</HI> a Victory as compleat in its pro|portion,
as ours was at <HI>Ramellies;</HI>&mdash;and
which was follow'd by the Lo&s;s of all <HI>Spain,</HI>
the City of <HI>Barcelona</HI> excepted.</P>
<P>The Lo&s;s of that famous Expedition of
the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and Prince <HI>Eugene,</HI> and
Rai&s;ing of the Siege of <HI>Tholoun,</HI> where the
Mare&s;chal <HI>de The&s;&s;e</HI> effectually retriev'd the
Honour he lo&s;t at <HI>Barcelona,</HI> and made him|&s;elf
a full Amends upon the Confederates,
by Po&s;ting him&s;elf &s;o in the Teeth of the
<HI>German</HI> Army, that Prince <HI>Eugene,</HI> tho' al|low'd
to be as Great a General as the World
has now to &s;how, could neither attack him,
di&s;lodge him, or carry on the Siege of the
Town without it; and &s;o was oblig'd, &s;hame|fully
enough, to break up, and Retreat with
Lo&s;s and Di&s;honour.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, nothing, from this Time, &s;uc|ceded
but in <HI>Flanders;</HI> and tho' it is true,
that by the meer Strength of Arms and Su|periority
of Forces, we carry'd very con&s;i|derable
Towns, &s;uch as <HI>Li&s;le, Tournay, Mons,
Doway, St. Venant, Aire,</HI> and <HI>Bouchain,</HI> and
fought Three Battles, as at <HI>Weynendale, Ou|denard,</HI>
and <HI>Blaregnies,</HI> yet in all the&s;e <HI>Victo|ries,</HI>
the fir&s;t excepted, we got little but the
Honour of the Field; and the la&s;t was &s;o de|&s;tructive,
and ruinous a Victory, that &s;uch an|other
would have broken the Troops pa&s;t the
<PB N="35" REF="44">
po&s;&s;ibility of being quickly re&s;tor'd, having lo&s;t
above 22000 Men, upon the Field of Battle,
without any Advantage but the meer Name
of a <HI>Victory;</HI> and that of having beaten the
Enemy out of the Field of Battle; where, in
le&s;s than 14 Days, they came and encamp'd
again, even upon the &s;ame Spot.</P>
<P>The Conque&s;ts of the Towns al&s;o being
all made by de&s;perate Sieges, and Defended
to the la&s;t Extremity; co&s;t us &s;o much
Blood, and &s;o di&s;couraged and di&s;pirited our
Men, that in the la&s;t Campaign, upon the
very Naming a Siege, the De&s;ertion of the
Men would be &s;o great, that no Campaign,
&s;ince the War, has given Proof of the like,
which caus'd the King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> to Publi&s;h
the &s;evere&s;t Proclamation again&s;t his Sub|jects
that &s;hould De&s;ert, that was ever heard
of, <HI>viz.</HI> That their No&s;es &s;hould be cut off,
be declar'd Infamous, and be &s;ent Home to
be kept in perpetual Impri&s;onment, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In other Places I might give you an Ac|count
of the Defeat of the <HI>Germans:</HI> Under
Count <HI>Mercy,</HI> by the Count <HI>du Bourg;</HI> on the
Upper <HI>Rhine;</HI> the Inva&s;ion in <HI>Scotland;</HI> and
the like, which la&s;t, tho' it fail'd in Succe&s;s,
yet had its evil Effects, not a few among us

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">This Chapter contains an Abridgement
of the Hi&s;tory of PARTIES among
us, deduced from their Introduction
into the State, from and after the
Union; and &s;tated and brought down
as they now appear among us, to
the Time of Pa&s;&s;ing the Occa&s;ional
Bill, and therein Fini&s;hing the Ruin
of the Di&s;&s;enters.</HEAD>
<P>_OUR la&s;t Chapter giving a
General Scheme of Things
before the <HI>Union</HI> of the
Two Kingdoms, <HI>viz.</HI> in what
Manner the Pro&s;perity of
the Nation both began and
afterwards declin'd, it follows according to
the Method pre&s;cribed, that this Chapter
&s;hould enter more particularly into the De|tail
of our <HI>Divi&s;ions, Parties,</HI> and <HI>Di&s;tracti|ons</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="47">
which immediately followed, and by
which it will more particularly appear by
what Steps we came to the pre&s;ent Condi|tion
we are in, and to what Originals are
Owing the Heats, Fury,$ and Animo&s;ities
which Reign among us.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t remarkable Tran&s;action which
happen'd at Court, after the <HI>Union,</HI> was an
open and irreconcileable Breach between the
Lord Trea&s;urer, <HI>God</HI>&mdash;<HI>n,</HI> and the Duke of
<HI>M</HI>&mdash;<HI>gh</HI> on one part, and the then Secreta|ry
of State, Mr. <HI>Harley,</HI> on the other: A begin|ning
fruitful of Great Events, and which put
the whole Body of our Parties into a New
Ferment, till the I&s;&s;ue has produced many
and great Changes in both <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> and <HI>Mea|&s;ures,</HI>
and been indeed, the Original of all the
&s;everal Phenomena of <HI>Court Policies</HI> which
have happen'd &s;ince in either Kingdom, and
which has, more or le&s;s, affected every Branch
of the Government, and every Party among
the People; this may well be accounted an
<HI>Unhappy Occurrence,</HI> as it has Embroil'd the
Nation in many <HI>Di&s;orders,</HI> and ended in the
Ruin, as to the Favour of their Prince, and
as to <HI>Publick Employment,</HI> of the whole <HI>Mi|ni&s;try</HI>
of that Time, as &s;hall appear in its
Place.</P>
<P>The Inva&s;ion made by the <HI>French</HI> in <HI>Scot|land,</HI>
in behalf of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> with the
Con&s;equences of that Expedition, not &s;o
much Hi&s;torically, as it re&s;pected the Ene|my,
<PB N="39" REF="48">
but Familiarly, as it re&s;pected our <HI>Civil
Broils,</HI> either in <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Scotland,</HI> may
be &s;aid to be an effect of this Mi&s;chief: For
&s;o many wrong Steps were taken at Home,
by running upon the <HI>Bank,</HI> to the danger
of the <HI>Publick Credit;</HI> by bringing Pri|&s;oners
from <HI>Scotland,</HI> taken up, as was al|ledg'd,
as Party and Affection, not real Rea|&s;on
and Danger directed, the bringing them
up as Criminals in Cu&s;tody to <HI>England,</HI> and
then having nothing to &s;ay to them; and
many other Mi&s;terious Articled of Manage|ment,
which had little to be &s;aid to defend
them, prov'd &s;trongly, That the <HI>Publick</HI> was
in &s;ome &s;trange Ferment, which would cer|tainly
appear, and break but in a little time
as indeed it did, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of <HI>Wi&s;e|men,</HI>
the encouragement of the then <HI>Outed-Party</HI>
and the ruin of both the <HI>Contending-Intere&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>I am far from being of their Opinion, who
have frequently, and publickly, pretended to
wi&s;h, that the <HI>Pretender</HI> had Landed in <HI>Scot|land,</HI>
or thought that it might have been bet|ter
for us if it had been &s;o; and I beg Leave
for a Digre&s;&s;ion on that needful Subject, tho'
it may be &s;omething long; &s;uch a Thought,
in Men who own and pretend to be for the
<HI>Pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment,</HI> (for if they &s;peak as
<HI>Jacobites</HI> they alter the Ca&s;e) can be rational,
upon no other Suppo&s;ition than that of the
<HI>Invaders</HI> being ea&s;ily conquer'd when they
<PB N="40" REF="49">
&s;hould Land, which, &s;ay they, would not only
have put an End to the <HI>Pretender,</HI> by his in|evitable
falling into our Hands; but would
eventually have been the Ruin of the <HI>Ja|cobite</HI>
Intere&s;t in <HI>Scotland;</HI> the Overthrow
of the Party; and perhaps at la&s;t, the final
End of the <HI>High-Land</HI> Superiorities, which
at pre&s;ent, is the greate&s;t Danger and Of|fence
to the <HI>Briti&s;h Government,</HI> and which
has in it &s;ome Difficulties in the Con&s;titu|tion
by means of the <HI>Union,</HI> which the
<HI>Crown</HI> has no other Way ever to get the
Ma&s;tery of: This is as much as can be &s;aid
on that Head.</P>
<P>But, as &s;uch People are pre&s;um'd not to
have taken <HI>right Mea&s;ures,</HI> or to have look'd
into the Dangers of other Kinds with which
&s;uch a <HI>Succe&s;s</HI> would have been attended,
they are de&s;ired to con&s;ider a few of the fol|lowing
Generals, all which were attended
with, particular Mi&s;chiefs; too many to be
enumerated.</P>
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Diver&s;ion to the Campaign then
ju&s;t going to begin; the Duke of <HI>Marl|borough</HI>
being thought the only Man fit
to be Tru&s;ted with the Affair, and
about 22000 Men adjudg'd needful.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The ruin of the Country, which, as
Mea&s;ures mu&s;t have been taken, wou'd
have been at lea&s;t two Months in the

3. The blow to <HI>Publick-Credit</HI> at Home,

<ITEM>5. The many Ways it would have an|&s;wer'd

them&s;elves no Good, have many Ways
&s;erv'd the Intere&s;t of the <HI>French,</HI> who
for that purpo&s;e, at fir&s;t &s;omented their
Di&s;orders.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q>
<P>As for the probable Progre&s;s and Succe&s;s,
which in the mean time, and before our
Army could have come up with them, we
having no Fortify'd <HI>Frontiers,</HI> no Place of
<HI>Arms,</HI> no Magazines of <HI>War-like Stores,</HI> or
Provi&s;ion laid up there, we ought to have ex|pected;
the Readeris referr'd to the following
Account, taken out of the Preface to the <HI>Hi|&s;tory
of the late Union,</HI> and publi&s;h'd in <HI>Edin$.</HI>
the Year after the Inva&s;ion, where this Ca&s;e
is &s;poken to at large, thus:</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, never was Nation in
&s;uch a Condition to be Invaded; and there
is no doubt but, had the <HI>French</HI> landed their
Forces, and got their Stores of Arms and Am|munition
<PB N="42" REF="51">
on Shore, as they might ea&s;ily have
done, if they had not over-&s;hot their Port,
they would with very little Oppo&s;ition have
been Ma&s;ters of the whole Country.</P>
<Q>It may be thought, by &s;ome, remote to my
Purpo&s;e, to demon&s;trate this; but when
I con&s;ider what different Notions the
People in <HI>England</HI> have of the Attempt
of the <HI>French,</HI> and their Succe&s;s in it,
I cannot think it a u&s;ele&s;s Labour, to
give you a brief E&s;&s;ay, at what the Event
of that Enterprize might probably have
been,&mdash;that &s;o we may &s;ee what we
have to be Thankful for, therefore I
proceed;</Q>
<P>I am now to &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>French</HI> &s;afe on
Shore; their <HI>Magazine</HI> and <HI>Train of Artil|lery</HI>
Landed, and the Earl of <HI>Levin,</HI> the Ge|neral
for Her Maje&s;ty, retreating towards
<HI>Berwick,</HI> as he mu&s;t undoubtedly have done,
&mdash;and, as his Orders directed him to do;&mdash;
without which, his Retreat being cut off, he
mu&s;t have been Surrounded and Taken, or
have been cut in Pieces, having no Place of
Strength to Retreat to.</P>
<P>Had they been thus on Shore, there is no
doubt, but in two Hours, that is, in a very &s;hort
Time, they had been Ma&s;ters of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> an
open City, and without Defence: The Ca&s;tle,
indeed, might have held out &s;ome time; but the
<PB N="43" REF="52">
City could have made no Re&s;i&s;tance.&mdash;But that
which was wor&s;e, the Circum&s;tances of the Time
were &s;uch, and the People were &s;o divided,
that the City mu&s;t have &s;ent down to <HI>Leith</HI>
to have &s;ought Protection from the <HI>French</HI> a|gain&s;t
their own Rabbles; and they mu&s;t have
de&s;ired the <HI>French</HI> to have come and taken
them into their Protection, to have pre&s;erv'd
them from Plunder and Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>I think, whatever the Rea&s;ons of this were,
which I de&s;ire to bury in Silence, the Fact will
be readily granted; and indeed all Men own'd,
at that time, that if the <HI>French</HI> Landed their
Forces, they mu&s;t be Ma&s;ters of the City of
<HI>Edinburgh</HI> without any Oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>'Tis true, that I am now but upon &s;ugge&s;|tion,
and meer &s;uppo&s;ition; and I do not affirm
po&s;&s;itively; but I leave it to any Man to judge
of Probabilities, and whether, what I &s;ugge&s;t
is Rational or no; when the <HI>French</HI> were
thus po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> it is very rea|&s;onable
to &s;uppo&s;e that the fir&s;t Thing they
would have done, was to Proclaim their King;
if the Magi&s;trates of the City would not have
agreed to have performed the Ceremony; the
<HI>Tolbooth</HI> was near at Hand, and the Citi|zens
being a&s;&s;embl'd would &s;oon have cho&s;en
New Magi&s;trates, who would cheerfully have
done it&mdash;.</P>
<P>Their King being proclaim'd, it &s;eems ra|tional
to &s;uppo&s;e they next &s;hould &s;ummon the
Inhabitants to take an Oath of Fidelity to
<PB N="44" REF="53">
him; &s;uch as refus'd would have their E&s;tates
Confi&s;cated, and perhaps be Impri&s;on'd; and
if they got room to fly would have their Hou&s;es
Plunder'd.</P>
<P>Being thus Ma&s;ters of the Capital, and the
Queen's Troops having Fled, or Retreated to|wards
<HI>Berwick,</HI> the Coutrey expos'd to their
Power; I think I make no Tre&s;pa&s;s on good
Manners or Ju&s;tice, if I &s;ay the <HI>Northern
High-landers</HI> would have been rais'd by the
Authority of their Superiours, who were for
the mo&s;t part <HI>Jacobites.</HI>&mdash;The&s;e being in
Arms, the <HI>Low-Lands</HI> are at their Mercy, and
they had &s;oon po&s;&s;e&s;s'd them&s;elves of the whole
Country, the Militia being entirely without a
Head, and without Order, unlock'd from the
former Settlement, and unfix'd in a New.</P>
<P>Being thus po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of the <HI>Low-Lands,</HI>
they &s;oon would have been Ma&s;ters of the
whole Country; and indeed there were very
few that dur&s;t &s;hew their Faces again&s;t them,
the Forwardne&s;s of one Party, and the Di&s;|orders
and Divi&s;ions of the other, making way
for it:&mdash;When they had thus reduced the
<HI>Low-Lands,</HI> they had no more to do then to call
a <HI>Convention of E&s;tates,</HI> as at the <HI>Revolu|ton,</HI>
and finding the&s;e fa&s;t to their Intere&s;t; the
Fir&s;t Ca&s;e would be to recind the <HI>Revolution;</HI>
declare the <HI>limited Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> a <HI>vi&s;ible Re|bellion,</HI>
and invading the <HI>Right</HI> of another;
and thus a compleat National Turn would
have pa&s;s'd upon us; and the <HI>Revolution</HI>
<PB N="45" REF="54">
&s;hould &s;uffer a <HI>Re-revolution</HI> in a few Weeks:
The&s;e Things would require but little time,
neither is it Pre&s;umption to &s;uppo&s;e they &s;hould
have gotten a Repre&s;entative return'd, that
would have come into &s;uch Mea&s;ures; &s;ince
they having the ab&s;olute Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Coun|try,
the influencing them under &s;uch Circum|&s;tances,
to the choo&s;ing of &s;uch Per&s;ons as
they &s;hall think fit to put upon them, was ea&s;ie
enough: In&s;tances of which have been but
too common in this I&s;land, under a le&s;s Tyran|nical
Power than a <HI>French</HI> Army.</P>
<P>While they were thus &s;ettling their <HI>Civil Go|vernment,</HI>
&mdash;their <HI>Military Affairs</HI> would not
have fail'd; the Inclination of the Comon Peo|ple
about <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and the Influence of
the Chiefs and Heads of <HI>Clans</HI> in the <HI>High-Lands,</HI>
would have &s;oon furni&s;h'd Men for a
<HI>New-Revolution;</HI>&mdash;the Sixteen Regiments
which they brought with them (&s;o it &s;eems
they had determin'd) &s;hould have had 200
Men added to every Regiment, by way of fill|ing
up,&mdash;Five Regiments of Dragoons, and
Forty Battalions of Foot, were to have been
rais'd immediately&mdash;; the Command of the&s;e
Troops was to be given <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Officers, and of
&s;uch they brought great Numbers with them;
&s;ave only that the Colonels, and &s;ome Captains
were to be cho&s;en of the Superiors, or Chiefs,
where they were rais'd, to Encourage the
rai&s;ing them.</P>
<P>Thus, in le&s;s than Six Weeks, they &s;hou'd
<PB N="46" REF="55">
have had 30000 Men added to the Troops
they brought with them&mdash;the Money
they would have given the <HI>High-land</HI> Gentle|men,
would effectually have brought the&s;e
Gentlemen to for &s;ake their Prince and join
with them; and thus the De&s;ign would have
gone on beyond Expectation.</P>
<P>We are next to enquire, what was to be|come
of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Preparation all this
while? You have beard what Strength they
were of, when come together; but it could
not be po&s;&s;ible they could all be brought to|gether,
their Magazines furni&s;h'd (for the
<HI>French,</HI> would have taken care they &s;hould
have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted ill enough in <HI>Scotland,</HI>) their
<HI>Train of Artillery</HI> have been come up, and
they in Condition to have march'd into <HI>Scot|land</HI>
in Battalia, as they mu&s;t have done, un|der
&s;ix Weeks or two Months&mdash;the
Difficuties of the Roads, the Country being
at that time very deep, and the Carriages
heavy, &s;hould have made it very bad march|ing
an Army&mdash;and the Want of For|rage
would have made it impracticable to
have done it &s;ooner.</P>
<P>All this time the <HI>French Jacobites</HI> in <HI>Scot|land</HI>
would have had, to have &s;teengthen'd
their <HI>New Settlement,</HI> form'd their <HI>Army,</HI>
fortify'd <HI>Leith</HI> and other Places, and have
prepar'd for <HI>War.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall readily grant, as any-Body can de|&s;ire,
That when the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Army came to
<PB N="47" REF="56">
be ready, and enter <HI>Scotland,</HI> they &s;hould
Beat the&s;e <HI>New-Invaders</HI> out of all; and
that they &s;hould, in time, pay Dear for the
Attempt; but it mu&s;t be granted, this would
have the&s;e Con&s;equences withal: (1.) That
it would have ruin'd <HI>Scotland;</HI> (2.) brought
the Seat of War Home to our own Doors;
(3.) cau&s;ed a Diver&s;ion of our Forces, and been
an Occa&s;ion of withdrawing our Troops from
<HI>Flanders,</HI> where the Enemy felt the greate&s;t
Weight of the War, and (4.) have exceed|ingly
protracted the War. Tho&s;e Gentle|men
that were for having them Land, may
con&s;ult the&s;e probable Con&s;equences, and
they will &s;ee whether they have not very
good rea&s;on to be &s;en&s;ible of the Happine&s;s
of the Di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>Thus far was ob&s;erv'd then upon, the
Spot, and, indeed, the Condition of <HI>England</HI>
concurr'd to make it rational; for the <HI>Train</HI>
of <HI>Artillery,</HI> and <HI>Stores for War,</HI> were not
to be ventur'd by Sea, &s;o as to have the Ar|my
to march without them; they were or|der'd
from the <HI>Tower,</HI> and it was Twenty
Days e'er the Officers propos'd to be ready;
the Badne&s;s of the Roads, and the Length
of the Way was &s;uch that they could not
po&s;&s;ibly be &s;uppo&s;ed to arrive at <HI>Berwick</HI>
under 20 Days more, all which Time mu&s;t
have been &s;pent before, the Army could have
&s;et their, Foot into <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="57">
But I leave this, and believe it is enough
demon&s;trated, and therefore the Nation
cannot but be &s;en&s;ible, that the whole was
a happy Deliverance from Heaven; and this
Nation had much better have employ'd
their Management in Giving Thanks for
E&s;caping from that, and putting them&s;elve
in a Po&s;ture to prevent the like, than to fall
into <HI>Parties,</HI> as they did, to &s;uch a Degree,
as that the Enemy have &s;ince had Oppor|tunities
to do the like, without an Army, ra|ther
than any Occa&s;ion to &s;end another.</P>
<P>This was that fatal Breach between the
<HI>Antients</HI> and the <HI>Moderns,</HI> as it was wittily
called at that Time, <HI>viz.</HI> between the <HI>Old-Whiggs</HI>
and the <HI>New-Whiggs,</HI> or to &s;peak

<P>It remains pretty much a Mi&s;tery to this

utmo&s;t Di&s;covery that we can arrive to in
<PB N="49" REF="58">
that Ca&s;e, tho' after nice Enquiry, amounts

In the Proce&s;s of this Management we

<HI>Mini&s;try</HI> not the &s;ame among the People as
it u&s;ed to be; and e&s;pecially, Declining with
the Queen; an Alteration, perhaps, as much
Owing to the Impolitick Stiffne&s;s, not to
&s;ay Rudene&s;s, of One Old <HI>She Favourite,</HI>
as to all the In&s;inuations and Aggre&s;&s;ions of
the <HI>New:</HI> The <HI>High-Flying</HI> Intere&s;t, as we ob|&s;erv'd,
finding it now their Time to &s;trike,
prepar'd their Mea&s;ures with the utmo&s;t Si|lence
and Cunning; they had, indeed, given
Signals of their concerted De&s;igns by all
po&s;&s;ible, but private Hints, &s;uch as, That
now was the Time for the Friends of the
<HI>Church</HI> to exert them&s;elves; that the
<HI>Church</HI> would have one Blow yet for it;
and that her Enemies did not know her
Strength; and to that length they came,
that a little before the Meeting of the Par|liament,
1710, they cau&s;ed an Adverti&s;e|ment
to be publi&s;h'd in the Prints, and in|du&s;triou&s;ly
&s;pread about, &s;ignifying to the
Clergy, <HI>That now was the Time to exert
them&s;elves for the Service and Intere&s;t of
the</HI> Church. The unwary Town took little
Notice of this Adverti&s;ement; but tho&s;e

Care to let their Friends know the Mean|ing

The fir&s;t Thing which po&s;&s;ibly encou|raged
them in the Pro&s;pects they had of

in this, That the <HI>Juncto</HI> and <HI>Whiggs</HI> na|med
before, in their la&s;t unaccountable Step
relating to the <HI>Mini&s;try,</HI> had introduced, into
the Hou&s;es of Parliament many of their

Whiggs</HI> were otherwi&s;e, as true to the <HI>Re|volution
Principle</HI> as them&s;elves, and known
by them to be &s;o; but this was not all, for
they not only brought many &s;uch in who
it was never in their Power, &s;ince that
Time, to throw out; but they thereby di|vided
and amu&s;ed the People in other Pla|ces,
&s;o that they were le&s;s &s;teady in their
Voting for <HI>Hone&s;t Men;</HI> being amus'd and
bewilder'd, not knowing to Day who was
to be accounted an <HI>Hone&s;t Man</HI> to Morrow;
&s;o that when the other Intere&s;t, in &s;ub&s;e|quent
Elections, began to put forward, the
<HI>Whiggs</HI> &s;ound the People loo&s;e, their Intere&s;t
broken, and the <HI>Free-holders</HI> Choo&s;ing, the
<HI>Tories,</HI> by the very Example which the
<HI>Whiggs</HI> had given them the Se&s;&s;on before.</P>
<P>It was in vain for a <HI>Whigg</HI> to argue with
a poor Hone&s;t <HI>Free-holder,</HI> or to pre&s;s him
<PB N="52" REF="61">
not to Vote for Sir <HI>W</HI>&mdash;<HI>m,</HI> but for Mr.&mdash;

<P><PB N="54" REF="63">
The <HI>Sermon</HI> was, to the highe&s;t Degree,
<HI>In&s;olent, Unmannerly, Untrue</HI> in <HI>Sub&s;tance;</HI>
and what, as no Man of Mode&s;ty, or in his
Sen&s;es, wou'd have done, &s;o no Man ought
to be &s;uffer'd, unpuni&s;h'd, to have done it.
But the Re&s;enting it &s;o far, as to bring it to an

Mi&s;chiefs that en&s;u'd, and open'd the Door
for the greate&s;t Revolution of Affairs that
had happen'd from the coming in of the
Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI></P>
<P>I am not of the Opinion that &s;ome enter|tain,
<HI>viz.</HI> That &s;ecret Hands &s;ubtilly pu&s;h'd
the <HI>late Mini&s;try</HI> on to the Precipitation

Order'd it to have been Burnt by the <HI>Hang|man;</HI>
the <HI>Sermon</HI> voted <HI>Seditious,</HI> and the
<HI>Preacher Scandalous;</HI> and then there had
been an end of it: But, however, this might
have been the Wi&s;er way, as Things after|wards
fell out. I cannot &s;ee how it was in
the lea&s;t to be expected, that the <HI>Mini&s;try</HI>
could fore&s;ee the Con&s;equence, all which
<PB N="55" REF="64">
was owing to the Un&s;teadine&s;s of a certain

Party <HI>Pro&s;ecuting,</HI> but, if &s;ome &s;ay true, In|fluenced
<HI>&s;ome-body</HI> in Favour of the <HI>Crimi|nal:</HI>
Whether this be &s;o or not, this &s;eems to
be mo&s;t certain, that had a Sentence been pa&s;t
in any mea&s;ure &s;uitable to the Circum&s;tan|ces
of the <HI>Man,</HI> and Nature of the <HI>Crime;</HI>
had the <HI>Per&s;on</HI> been degraded as a <HI>Scanda|lous

Care&s;s'd by the <HI>Rabble,</HI> Sainted, Wor&s;hip'd,

Exce&s;s, as to make his own <HI>Friends</HI> a&s;ham'd
of him; nor had a <HI>Seditious Sermon</HI> had
&s;uch prodigious Effect all over this Nation,
as it had.</P>
<P>But the Nation was fill'd wth a Com|plication
of <HI>Di&s;orders</HI> and <HI>Di&s;&s;atisfactions,</HI>
and, like as a Body full of Humours, &s;inks
under the fir&s;t little Hurt it receives, which
at another time would he of no values; the
whole Flux of <HI>Politick Di&s;content;</HI> the Hu|mours
of the <HI>National Body,</HI> gave them&s;elves
<PB N="56" REF="65">
vent here: The People who were ripen'd
for <HI>Tumult,</HI> took Fire like Gunpowder, at the

is not to be wonder'd at, if abundance of
Incon&s;i&s;tant and Incongruous Steps were ta|ken
by tho&s;e who were not let into the
Secret, but were manag'd by tho&s;e who
were.</P>
<P>It is evident, the Affair of <HI>Sacheverell</HI> was
an accident, as it related to the Con&s;equences
that were produced from it, and the <HI>Party</HI>
that afterwards e&s;pous'd it, who, knowing no|thing
at fir&s;t of the Mea&s;ures that after|wards
were taken, yet fell in, Unanimou&s;ly,
with the Occa&s;ion that was given, and made
it &s;erve their Purpo&s;es, as well as if it had
been of their own Contrivance. The <HI>Pro|&s;ecution</HI>
of a <HI>Clergy-man</HI> gave an extraordi|nary
handle to tho&s;e who had been long en|deavouring
to revive the Old &s;ucce&s;sle&s;s
Notion of <HI>the Danger of the Church;</HI> they
ea&s;ily in&s;inuated into the Heads of the Ig|norant
Vulgar, that the Crime for which he
was Pro&s;ecuted, was <HI>Trifling</HI> and <HI>Frivolous;</HI>
and that tho' he had been ra&s;h, and might have
let fall &s;ome incon&s;iderate Words, it was be|low
the whole Body of the <HI>Mini&s;try,</HI> and not
worth while to embark the <HI>Government</HI> in
&s;uch a formal <HI>Pro&s;ecution,</HI> for a few Hot
Words of a <HI>Pari&s;h-Par&s;on;</HI> that if they had
had no other De&s;ign, than to have humbled

<PB N="57" REF="66">
have Voted it <HI>In&s;olent</HI> and <HI>Scandalous,</HI> as it
really was, and have brought him upon his
Knees at the Bar of the <HI>Hou&s;e;</HI> which had
been Mortification enough, to him, and in
which no-Body wou'd have Oppos'd them,
but the Carrying on the <HI>Pro&s;ecution</HI> to the
Heighth they did, made it evident, That
the De&s;ign was of greater Con&s;equence;
that the whole <HI>Clergy</HI> were concern'd in it;
that the <HI>Church</HI> it&s;elf was <HI>aim'd at;</HI> that
the <HI>Whiggs</HI> had been long in Confederacy
to clip the Wings of the <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks,</HI> and
to have reduc'd the <HI>Church of England</HI> to a
Comprehen&s;ion with, if not a Subjection to
<HI>Pre&s;byteriani&s;m,</HI> and the <HI>Fanaticks;</HI> and that
therefore it behov'd the whole Body of the
People of <HI>England,</HI> if they wou'd prevent the
Ruin of the <HI>Church,</HI> to appear, and &s;tand up
for this Ca&s;e of Doctor <HI>Sacheverell.</HI></P>
<P>The Succe&s;s they gain'd in the Tryal, ad|ded
to the Ea&s;ine&s;s of the People's Temper
at that time, to receive &s;uitable Impre&s;&s;ions,
as is before noted, made the&s;e Arguments
the more popular, and brought the Mobb
about the <HI>Criminal,</HI> whom they attended to
and from the Place of Tryal with Shouts and
Huffa's, as to a Triumph; erecting him, up|on
all Occa&s;ions, as a <HI>Martyr</HI> for the <HI>Church;</HI>

the Dwelling-Hou&s;es of the <HI>Di&s;&s;nting-Mini|&s;ters,</HI>
threatning to plunder the <HI>Bank,</HI> and

<P>But the Party who, as before, had &s;ubtil|ly

Purpo&s;es which they &s;ecretly de&s;ign'd, tho'

and that the <HI>Government</HI> ought to &s;teer, in
&s;ome Mea&s;ures, by that Rule in the future

Peace,</HI> &s;et on Foot this Year, <HI>with France,</HI>
and which will be known to the Ages to
come by the Title of <HI>The Treaty of</HI> Utrecht.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mini&s;try,</HI> who had &s;een the Difficul|ty,
the la&s;t Year, of <HI>Rai&s;ing Money,</HI> and the
Struggle of the <HI>Contrary Party</HI> to make it yet
more Difficult for the Time to come, knew
very well, that a Want either of <HI>Funds</HI> to
Borrow upon, or of <HI>Credit</HI> to Borrow; by,
both which, upon any return of a <HI>Whiggi&s;h</HI>
Majority, might ea&s;ily be interrupted, would

&s;hould always be able to keep the Intere&s;t

whom they knew Fluctuating and Uncertain
in their Tempers, and who might, by &s;ome
unfore&s;een Accident, be turn'd as violently
again&s;t them, as they were now for them;
and that any &s;uch Turn might hazard the
plunging the <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> into Inextricable Dif|faculties,
and &s;o drive the <HI>Sovereign</HI> to the
unavoidable Nece&s;&s;ity of changing Hands a
third Time.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="77">
The&s;e Things being apparent, and the
<HI>Mini&s;try too Wi&s;e not to &s;ee into it,</HI> put them
upon considering of Means for E&s;tabli&s;hing
them&s;elves in the <HI>Admini&s;tration,</HI> without
being put to the hazard of the Difficulties
afore&s;aid: It was ea&s;ie to perceive, that there
was but one Way to do this, and that was
to bring the War they had upon their Hands,
if po&s;&s;ible, to a Conclu&s;ion, that &s;o the An|nual
Demand of Va&s;t Sums for the carrying
It on, being at an End, the <HI>Hazards</HI> afore|&s;aid,
and Difficulties for the rai&s;ing it, would
Dye of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The Dangers of an Attempt of this Na|ture
did not appear &s;o great, as by People
out of the <HI>pre&s;ent Management</HI> was ima|gin'd;
the <HI>Circum&s;tances</HI> of the French King
were very well known; and he had di&s;co|ver'd
both the Nece&s;&s;ity he was in of a
<HI>Peace,</HI> and his De&s;ire of obtaining it, too
plainly for our Court not to know, that he
would accept the fir&s;t Intimation of that
kind with a great deal of Willingne&s;s. The
<HI>Confederates,</HI> at the la&s;t Treaty, had ty'd him
down &s;o Hard, had pre&s;s'd him &s;o Clo&s;e up|on
the Head of <HI>the Evacuation of</HI> Spain,
that he fore&s;aw the Ruin of all his Glory,
if he had comply'd with them, and there|fore
cho&s;e to hazard all in the Event of an|other
Campaign, rather than to yield to
&s;uch. <HI>Di&s;honourable Terms</HI> as he thought
them: And tho' in the proce&s;s of the next
<PB N="69" REF="78">
<HI>Campaign,</HI> he met with unexpected Encou|ragement,
as well from the Defeat of King
<HI>Charles's</HI> Armies in <HI>Spain,</HI> by which that
Prince was driven back again from the <HI>E&s;|curial</HI>
at <HI>Madrid,</HI> to his ancient Winter-Quarters
in <HI>Barcelona,</HI> as from the &s;udden
and unexpected Death of the <HI>Emperor,</HI> which
was nece&s;&s;arily attended with drawing off
a con&s;iderable Part of the Forces in <HI>Flanders,</HI>
by all which Accidents concurring in his
Favour, the <HI>Campaign</HI> ended without any
con&s;iderable Di&s;advantage on his Side; yet
he had not fall'd to make u&s;e. of his utmo&s;t
dexterity to bring the <HI>Confederates</HI> to a <HI>Ge|neral
Treaty of Peace:</HI> He had, in vain, ap|ply'd
him&s;elf to the <HI>States of Holland,</HI> to
the Duke of Savoy, to the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI>
and others; and it was no difficult Matter,
upon the lea&s;t Intimation of a probability
of Succe&s;s, to bring him to make the like
Application to the <HI>Briti&s;h-Court:</HI> How this
was brought to pa&s;s, and by what Agents,
whether by Application from hence, or by
Application from thence, the Facts &s;tand too
near in time for any Author with &s;afety to
follow Truth &s;o clo&s;e at the Heels.</P>
<P>It may &s;uffice to record, That about the
Month of <HI>September</HI> two Per&s;ons were ad|mitted
to come hither from <HI>France,</HI> in order
to lay the Platform of the de&s;ired Treaty,
we may do the <HI>French</HI> that Ju&s;tice, as to
own, That if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Court were not to
<PB N="70" REF="79">
be drawn in to Conclude and Sign Articles of
Peace for them&s;elve, previous to the <HI>Gene|ral
Treaty</HI> propos'd, and &s;eperate from the
re&s;t of their Allies; it 'twas not for want
of the utmo&s;t Endeavour, mo&s;t tempting
Propo&s;als, extraordinary Dexterity, and Ad|dre&s;s
of the <HI>French</HI> Agents employ'd here
nor can we entirely clear the <HI>French</HI> from
a Sugge&s;tion, very much to the Di&s;advantage
of their Integrity, which was, of indu&s;triou&s;ly
&s;preading Abroad, as well in <HI>Holland</HI> as in <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
a Report, That the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had made a
<HI>&s;eperate Peace;</HI> whether the <HI>French,</HI> if they
had any Hand in this, did it with a De&s;ign
to draw &s;ome of the other <HI>Confederates</HI> into
the like Snare, we cannot determine.</P>
<P>However, the French Agents were di&s;|appointed
in their Expectation; the End
here was fully an&s;wer'd, and the <HI>Engli&s;h
Mini&s;try</HI> brought the French to Sign and De|liver
<HI>Prapo&s;als,</HI> and to Reque&s;t Her Maje&s;ty
to procure a <HI>General Treaty</HI> with the Allies
at the &s;ame Time, Entering into no <HI>Engage|ments</HI>
with <HI>France</HI> of any Kind, farther than
a <HI>Verbal Promi&s;e to communicate the &s;aid
Propo&s;als to the Allies,</HI> and to influence
them, as far as might be, to con&s;ent to a
<HI>Treaty.</HI></P>
<P>It cannot be ami&s;s, however, to note what
U&s;e was made of this Step; how near it
went to have cro&s;s'd the whole Scheme of
the Mini&s;try; and to have defeated them in
<PB N="71" REF="80">
the <HI>Great End</HI> they aim'd at, <HI>viz.</HI> of

was the main De&s;ign of Embracing
the <HI>Propo&s;als atall,</HI> as was apparent on
many Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>But the other Party took Fire at the
<HI>Propo&s;als,</HI> and, Allarming all our own Peo|ple
fir&s;t, they quickly &s;pread the Jealou&s;y
among the <HI>Allies;</HI> and it became, at once, a

<P>We cannot &s;ay but the <HI>Policy,</HI> appear'd on

too much thro' the Mea&s;ures of both: The

for a <HI>General Treaty,</HI> drawn up in &s;everal

<HI>Chri&s;tendom.</HI> I &s;hould not need to have pub|li&s;h'd
the <HI>Propo&s;als&s;</HI> here, as they relate to the
<HI>Peace,</HI> for that is not the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the&s;e
Sheets, but as they relate to the <HI>Manage|ment</HI>
of <HI>Parties</HI> here; and as I &s;hall be oblig'd
to &s;ay much of them afterwards, it is nece&s;&s;a|ry
they &s;hould be handed down with the <HI>Sto|ry,</HI>

and <HI>&s;o</HI> mi&s;under&s;tood on either Side, and
leaving room to the <HI>French</HI> Dexterity of
Evading the True and Genuine De&s;ign of
the <HI>Confederates.</HI></P>
<P>It cannot be deny'd but this was mo&s;t
true, if the <HI>Propo&s;als</HI> of the <HI>French</HI> had been
<PB N="76" REF="85">
&s;o receiv'd, for they contained nothing but
what was capable of &s;uch <HI>General Con&s;tru|ction</HI>
as any one plea&s;ed to turn them to:
And this very Argument prov'd to others,
that they could not be thought to be <HI>Pre|liminaries</HI>
in the Sen&s;e as above; nay, the
more imperfect and ambiguous they ap|pear'd
to be, as to &s;uch a <HI>Con&s;truction,</HI> the
more unlikely and improbable it was that
the <HI>French</HI> could expect, or the <HI>Briti&s;h
Court</HI> could imagine, that the <HI>Con&s;ederates</HI>
&s;hould receive them as <HI>Preliminaries</HI> of a
Treaty.</P>
<P>As &s;oon, therefore, as the&s;e Objectons
came Abroad, they &s;eem'd to require no
other Reply than to Publi&s;h them as <HI>Pro|po&s;als</HI>
as they. really were receiv'd, and to
di&s;own them as <HI>Preliminaries.</HI></P>
<P>But the fir&s;t Error had gone &s;o far, and
the <HI>Confederates</HI> had receiv'd &s;uch Impre&s;|&s;ions
from hence, that the <HI>Briti&s;h Court</HI> had
&s;hown them <HI>foul Play,</HI> and had accepted the
&s;aid <HI>Articles as Preliminaries</HI> in the Sen&s;o
above; that large <HI>Repre&s;entations</HI> were made
of it from Abroad, as well by the States of
<HI>Holland</HI> as by the <HI>Elector of Hanover,</HI> but
more e&s;pecially the Ernperour, then King
of <HI>Spain,</HI> who appear'd highly mov'd, as it
was &s;aid, and te&s;tify'd his Re&s;entment, at his
Landing at <HI>Genoa,</HI> to Mr. <HI>Chetwynd,</HI> the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Envoy, who came to Compliment
him there, in Expre&s;&s;ions le&s;s re&s;pectful to Her
<PB N="77" REF="86">
<HI>Britannick Maje&s;ty</HI> than might be expected
from a Prince under &s;o many Obligations
as the Queen had laid on him. It &s;eems
King <HI>Charles</HI> might then think otherwi&s;e
of him&s;elf than on former Occa&s;ions, when
his Dependance on the A&s;&s;i&s;tance which he
Daily receiv'd from Her &s;aid Maje&s;ty oblig'd
him to treat Her with the utmo&s;t Deference
and Re&s;pect. But how, &s;ays the Author
of this Story, he tells Her, That <HI>If Her
Maje&s;ty thought fit to go on in this Manner,
it would oblige him to take other Mea&s;ures
for his own Security; and that the Re&s;t of
the Confederates mu&s;t and would do the like
by his Example;</HI> Or to that Effect. After
this, when he came to receive the <HI>Propo|&s;als,</HI>
as above, and with the re&s;t of the <HI>Fo|reign
Mini&s;ters</HI> to mi&s;take them for <HI>Preli|minaries</HI>
as afore&s;aid, we find him declaring
again&s;t entering into any Treaty with France
on that Foundation; and this in Terms &s;o
ab&s;olute, that he calls his Re&s;olutions <HI>Unal|terable,</HI>
re&s;olving to pu&s;h forward the <HI>War</HI>
with all imaginable Vigour: It is more at
large to be &s;een in his Maje&s;ty's Letter to
the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> and to the Elector <HI>Pa|latine,</HI>
as follows:</P>
<P>THAT his Maje&s;ty did not que&s;tion but

in <HI>England</HI> on the Part of <HI>France,</HI> (a Copy
<PB N="78" REF="87">
of which he &s;ubjoin'd) and wax no le&s;s con|cern'd

God had &s;o largely be&s;tow'd his Ble&s;&s;ings on
the Arms of the Allies, and when there was
ground to hope to reduce the Enemy within
ju&s;t Bounds, for the &s;ecuring the Tranquillity
of <HI>Europe,</HI> that Crown &s;hould offer &s;uch Pro|po&s;als,
which had not been only hearken'd to

in Form, the 9th <HI>October,</HI> to Count <HI>Gallas,</HI>
Mini&s;ter of his Maje&s;ty, by a Secretary of
State, and propos'd in <HI>Holland</HI> as acceptable,
with earne&s;t In&s;tances for entring into an

the Obligation the <HI>Allies</HI> are under, not
to enter into any Negotiation of a <HI>Separate

according to the <HI>Treaty of Alliance,</HI> and
therefore was rather inclin'd to believe, that
they had too ea&s;ily given Credit to the Cap|tious
<HI>Propo&s;als</HI> of the Enemy, tho' they were
not &s;o well varni&s;h;d as others had been; for
every one perceiv'd, at fir&s;t Sight, that hard|ly
any one thing in them was clearly expre&s;s'd,
and that the Enemy's De&s;ign was to gain Time,
by a long Nagotiation, as well for Recovering
them&s;elves, as for Dividing the Allies, which
they have endeavour'd to do along Time &s;ince;
that it was not difficult to fore&s;ee the Con&s;e|quences,
<PB N="79" REF="88">
if Men would only con&s;ider, with at|tention,
that &s;ince, with &s;o great Effu&s;ion of

United Forces of the Allies have not yet been
able to obtain the Principal End of this War,
that is, the common <HI>Security</HI> and <HI>Tranquil|lity</HI>
of <HI>Europe,</HI> what more can be expected
from a <HI>Separate Treaty,</HI> or its Execution,

<P>As for us (<HI>continues the Emperor</HI>) we

Union, for Obtaining an Advantage|ous

they may, following this laudable Example,
de&s;i&s;t from &s;uch Thoughts as are contrary,
<PB N="80" REF="89">
and entertain &s;uch as are conformable there|unto.</P>
<P>In the mean Time we have undertaken an

Eternal Gratitude, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I might give you &s;everal other Proofs of
this general Mi&s;take, as well from Authors
who, both Abroad and at Home, wrote up|on
the Subject, and exclaim'd loudly again&s;t
the&s;e <HI>Articles,</HI> as <HI>Preliminaries,</HI> as al&s;o &s;eve|ral
other Letters of his &s;aid Catholick Ma|je&s;ty

may &s;uffice</P>
<P>All the&s;e prove, undeniably, the general

<PB N="81" REF="90">
as afore&s;aid; whether It was at fir&s;t Acci|dentally
or Politickly done by our People
here, as I &s;aid before, I do not determine.</P>
<P>The next Ca&s;e, therefore, was for the <HI>Go|vernment</HI>
here to explain them&s;elves, how
the&s;e Propo&s;als were under&s;tood by them
and how they expected their Allies &s;hould
under&s;tand them; and this was done &s;o ef|fectually,
that at la&s;t the <HI>Emperor</HI> &s;eeing, at

as Succe&s;sful, in its Mi&s;chief appear'd, <HI>viz.
That the Peace was already made.</HI></P>
<P>This was a new Scarecrow: If I do not
give an Account of the Effect it had, both
Abroad and at Home, it is rather to conceal
Folly of it, than that the Thing was not of
very ill-Con&s;equence: It was impprov'd at
<HI>Home</HI> to promote the <HI>Di&s;&s;atisfactions,</HI> which
were already great enough, at the Procee|dings
towards a <HI>Treaty:</HI> the <HI>Condition</HI> of the
Nation was at this time very <HI>Unhappy;</HI> and
the Forwardne&s;s of the People to <HI>In&s;ult</HI> and
<HI>Quarrel</HI> at every Thing, made eyen tho&s;e
Things they had lea&s;t rea&s;on to object again&s;t,
appear wor&s;e than they were: The general
<HI>Management</HI> carry'd with it an appearance of
&s;omething <HI>Secret;</HI> and the People Univer|&s;ally
<PB N="82" REF="91">
Jealous of the <HI>Court,</HI> thought there
was a <HI>Private Aim</HI> which none could pene|trate
In every Thing they did, and therefore
frequent Conjectures were made as Men's
<HI>Pa&s;&s;ions</HI> and <HI>Prejudices</HI> guided them.</P>
<P>It is an unhappy Circum&s;tance to be ren|der'd
generally &s;u&s;pected, for that whatever is
done under that <HI>Dilemna,</HI> that will admit two
Con&s;tructions, always receives the wor&s;t.
It Is true, the <HI>Court</HI> aim'd at a <HI>Peace,</HI> and their
Rea&s;ons for it were &s;o pre&s;&s;ing, that it was
apparent they would abate much of the
Terms to bring it to pa&s;s; their Circum|&s;tances
at Home made it Nece&s;&s;ary, as is no|ted
before; yet, that from hence it was Ra|tional

they &s;hould then be freed from the Weight
that embarra&s;s'd them every Year, <HI>viz.</HI> Of

again&s;t them, whereby they might be check'd
in the <HI>Management</HI> of <HI>Publick Affairs;</HI>
whereas, if the <HI>War</HI> was once over, there
would be little Need of Supplies, and by
Con&s;equence, le&s;s Need of <HI>Parliaments;</HI> &s;hort
Se&s;&s;ions, and little Bu&s;ine&s;s, would, in Time,

<P>The <HI>Party</HI> who were di&s;plac'd, convin|ced
of all this, and too Wi&s;e not to &s;ee the
De&s;ign, left no Stone unturn'd, as above,
to make all the Notion of a <HI>Treaty</HI> appear di&s;|bonourable;
to do this they &s;ugge&s;t that there
was a Concert with <HI>France;</HI> that the Mini&s;try
had made a private <HI>Bargain;</HI> that <HI>Spain,</HI> for
which &s;o much Blood had been lo&s;t, was to be
given up to the <HI>French;</HI> and, at la&s;t, in &s;hort,

<P>It was very hard to beat the fir&s;t Su&s;pi|cions

agree to think the Queen a <HI>Pagan,</HI> a Mocker
of God, and a De&s;pi&s;er of all <HI>Religion:</HI>
That Her Maje&s;ty &s;hould <HI>Order the whole

Things &s;top'd the Mouth of this Piece of
<HI>Clamour.</HI></P>
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Nearne&s;s of the <HI>Treaty</HI> when the
Thing mu&s;t inevitably come to a De|mon&s;tration;
and when all the <HI>Pleni|potentiaries
being to meet,</HI> if there
were any Conce&s;&s;ions made to <HI>France,</HI>
by the <HI>Briti&s;h Court,</HI> the other <HI>Parties</HI>
who might think them&s;elves agriev'd
by them, would not fail, loudly to com|plain
of it, and &s;o it would have a Con|firmation
too plain to be contradicted.
The next was,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Promi&s;e the Queen made, in Her
Me&s;&s;age above, to lay the Heads of the
<HI>Treaty</HI> before the <HI>Parliament</HI> for them
to peru&s;e, and, indeed, judge or approve
of before the &s;ame &s;hould be conclu|ded;
and to fix a &s;hort Day for the
<HI>French</HI> to comply with what &s;hould be
propos'd, or the <HI>Treaty</HI> to be put to a
Conclu&s;ion.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q>
<P>The&s;e Two Things &s;o either &s;atisfy'd
tho&s;e who were dubious and in different, or
&s;top'd the Mouths of tho&s;e who were cla|morous
<PB N="88" REF="97">
and quarrel&s;ome, that we heard no
more of the Notion of a <HI>Seperate Peace</HI> be|ing
made in <HI>England:</HI> Yet, that this Thing
may be left a little plainer to Po&s;terity than
the People, at this Time, could be inform'd
of it, I may venture to &s;ay thus much of
what was done by Way of &s;ecret Tran&s;acti|on,
and which, I mu&s;t own, I do not &s;ee
that any room was left for any one at
Home to complain of it neither.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> having try'd, in vain, to bring
the <HI>Confeder$$s</HI> to a <HI>General Treaty,</HI> and to
lay a&s;ide the <HI>Preliminaries,</HI> which were as
&s;o many Fetters upon them, that had ham|per'd
and lock'd them up to &s;uch Severities,
as they judg'd equal to the Ruin of their
<HI>Monarch,</HI> had cho&s;en Twice to venture All
rather than to comply with that Method of
<HI>Treating.</HI></P>
<P>But their Nece&s;&s;ity of a <HI>Peace</HI> encrea&s;ing,
and the Misfortunes of the <HI>War</HI> pre&s;&s;ing
them hard, they behov'd to try it, by ma|king
larger Conce&s;&s;ions to <HI>One Branch</HI> of
the <HI>Confederacy,</HI> than they had made in Ge|neral,
to &s;ee it, thereby, they could induce
that Branch to e&s;pou&s;e Thoughts of a <HI>Peace,</HI>
and concern them&s;elves to bring it to pa&s;s.

<PB N="89" REF="98">
Rea&s;on to hope they might fix. their Project

<HI>as before,</HI> to di&s;engage them&s;elves from the
Embarra&s;&s;inents of the War, in Order to
the E&s;tabli&s;hing them&s;elves, and Defeating
the Outed-Party, as has been at large &s;et
down, admini&s;ter'd room enough for the
<HI>French</HI> to make the Attempt, and they were
too wi&s;e to &s;lip the Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Accordingly, as has already been laid
down, <HI>Propo&s;als</HI> are made by <HI>France,</HI> and
receiv'd by Her Maje&s;ty; and the Queen
&s;o far comes into the <HI>French</HI> De&s;ire to agree
to offer tho&s;e Propo&s;als to the <HI>Allies,</HI> and do
all the good Offices She could, or u&s;e Her
Intere&s;t with the <HI>Allies</HI> to bring them to a
<HI>Treaty,</HI> where, if his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty

to make &s;uch <HI>Conce&s;&s;ions</HI> and <HI>Propo|&s;itions,</HI>
as might be &s;atisfactory to the <HI>Allies,</HI>
it was not to be doubted but a good <HI>Peace</HI>
might en&s;ue.</P>
<P>To &s;ay, That, in Order to bring the
Queen of <HI>Great Britain</HI> to this, it was not
Ju&s;t and Rea&s;onable not only to a&s;&s;ure Her
Maje&s;ty, That Her Subjects &s;hould find their
Intere&s;t in it, was as much as to &s;ay, That
all the <HI>Allies</HI> &s;hould receive Satisfaction but
Her Maje&s;ty: Nor could <HI>France</HI> expect that
the <HI>Briti&s;h Mini&s;try</HI> would appear for this
<HI>Treaty,</HI> unle&s;s <HI>France</HI> had de&s;cended to &s;uch;

without Prejudice to the re&s;t of the <HI>Allies,</HI>
as the Queen might have Rea&s;on to be &s;a|tisfy'd

Satisfactions and Advantages for
<HI>Britain,</HI> which, at a general <HI>Treaty;</HI> the would
yield to Her <HI>Britannick Maje&s;ty,</HI> and that
She might engage to this, at the &s;ame Time.
The Queen, or the <HI>Briti&s;h Mini&s;try,</HI> Engaging

that if, at the <HI>General Treaty,</HI> all the re&s;t of
the <HI>Allies</HI> might receive full Satisfaction in
their ju&s;t Demands, that then, indeed, Her
Maje&s;ty would not &s;tick Out. And thus
the Whole of a <HI>Private Treaty</HI> amounted to
this, That <HI>France</HI> was under Engagements
to the Queen, but that the Queen was un|der
none to him.</P>
<P>Nor did it appear that the&s;e <HI>Engagements</HI>
could ever amount to more, than what re|&s;pected
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of <HI>Ports; Advantages</HI> of

may no more &s;eem a Mi&s;tery after the
<HI>Treaty,</HI> when every Thing appears in its

proper Place, and with a true Light, yet it
is impo&s;&s;ible to account for the various Di&s;|orders
and Perplexities which agitated the
Minds of the People at this Time, but by laying
open the &s;ecret Hi&s;tory of the Two

their View, tho', in their Effects, they had
no relation either to the <HI>Treaty,</HI> or to the

Days Di&s;covering the Truth of Things,
hu&s;h'd and damp'd the Forwardne&s;s of tho&s;e

in Agitation at that Time, and the <HI>Mini&s;try,</HI>
for the Rea&s;ons afore&s;aid, having good
Grounds to pu&s;h on the Forming a <HI>Treaty,</HI>
no Body will doubt but they had the &s;ame

<PB N="92" REF="101">
which might pa&s;s in either Hou&s;e to the
Prejudice of the &s;aid <HI>Treaty</HI> in View, and this,

by due Enquiry, Information, and Calcula|tion,
a Thing commonly in U&s;e, and known
by the Phra&s;e of Telling No&s;es, and Trying
the Strength of the Hou&s;es; made a due
Judgment of what they might expect when
the Hou&s;es met. It is true, the Town di&s;|cover'd
&s;ome Unea&s;ine&s;s, and People &s;aid,
They were afraid to let the Parliament <HI>Sit,
&amp;c.</HI> but the Mini&s;try, not Regarding the
Clamours of a Few, went on their own
Way 'till they thought them&s;elves Safe, and
then the Hou&s;es were allow'd to Meet.</P>
<P>At their fir&s;t Meeting Her Maje&s;ty laid
before them the State of Things relating to

Meeting fell out. While the <HI>Whigg</HI> Lords,
joyning together in their Oppo&s;ing the
Mea&s;ures taken by the <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> for the Car|rying
on a <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>Peacey</HI> yet found &s;ome
who, tho' on the contrary extream in the
Affair of Parties, were yet of the &s;ame Opini|on
as to the War, and whom they thought
ea&s;y to be brought to joyn in Mea&s;ures to
carry on that Oppo&s;ition: They therefore
made no Scruple to make Advances to the&s;e,
and to lay their former Di&s;putes a&s;ide, in
Order to carry on a pre&s;ent Quarrel at the
Publick. The Party that did this had been
&s;upported in all their Intere&s;ts by the
<HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> and had found the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI>
the true dead Weight on their Side, up|on
all Occasions, by Voting for them in
all Elections; by Turning the Scale in
the Ca&s;es of Magi&s;trates; Members Banks;
Companies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by Supporting Credit; and
Supplying infinite Sums of Money upon
their Funds on all Occa&s;ions; and, as may
be well &s;aid, even without Funds, ma|ny
Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds, whereof
they are not paid to this Day, and, perhaps,
<PB N="102" REF="111">
never &s;hall be paid, and therefore this was
the more Surprizing. But this may be more
proper in another Place; I &s;hall allude a
little to it by Tran&s;cribing to you a little
&s;hort Paper which was handed about in
Manu&s;cript at that Time, call'd, <HI>A Speech
of a Stone</HI> Chimney-Piece, which alludes to
this very Tran&s;acrion, &s;ome Part of which
was to this Purpo&s;e:</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The Speech &s;poken by the Stone Chim|ney-Piece
in the Hou&s;e of Lords.</HEAD>
<P>THE Bill for&mdash;being read and com|mitted,
and no Lord offering to &s;peak
again&s;t it, on a &s;udden a great Noi&s;e was
heard towards the Fire, and from a Crack
in the Chimney-Piece the&s;e Words were au|dibly
heard.</P>
<P>Wonder not, my Lords, when you &s;it mute;
like <HI>Statues</HI> of <HI>Stone,</HI> that I &s;peak. I
am now a <HI>Peer,</HI> and &s;ince you, with Hearts
harder than Rocks, can tamely abandon tho&s;e
poor Creatures who have tru&s;ted to your <HI>Pro|tection,</HI>
without Saying one Word for them,
my &s;ofter <HI>Stone,</HI> cannot any longer keep Silence.</P>
<P>I have often been Witne&s;s, my Lords, to
the <HI>Zeal</HI> and <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion</HI> with which &s;ome of you
have defended their <HI>Cau&s;es.</HI> I heard, with
<HI>Pleasure,</HI> tho&s;e <HI>Reverend Prelates,</HI> tho&s;e <HI>No|ble
<PB N="103" REF="112">
Patriots</HI> plead for them, and now I &s;ee
them Sit more, unconcern'd than my &s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>For God's &s;ake,</HI> my lords, what meant
your former <HI>Zeal?</HI> Or what means your pre|&s;ent
<HI>Indolence?</HI> Were you in the Wrong
when you Oppose'd what novo you Con&s;ent to?
Or are you now in the Wrong in Con&s;enting
to what you before reckoned the greate&s;t Act
of Violence and <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ion?</HI> Speak, my
Lords; a Rea&s;on of your Change is due from
you.</P>
<P>Here was a long Pau&s;e, and all Silent;
What Silent &s;till! I conjure you by your Ho|nours,
my Lords, to &s;peak; here was another
Pau&s;e; and yet Silent, what Silent &s;till! Oh!
Shameful Change! Will not the Sen&s;e of
Honour move you more than <HI>Statues?</HI>
Hearken then to me and I &s;till reprove you.</P>
<P>I will not, my Lords, tell all that I have
heard you whi&s;per while you loll'd on me, in
your late unnatural <HI>Care&s;&s;es;</HI> I will not ex|po&s;e
you too far, but I have not been totally
Deaf, I heard what pa&s;s'd token you &s;old your
Friends and fold them for <HI>Nought,</HI> for a
<HI>Vote,</HI> for a &s;ingle Worthle&s;s Vote, that will
de&s;ert you in the Matter you depend upon it
for, and &s;o return upon you a ju&s;t <HI>Retribution.</HI></P>
<P>Was this, my Lords, an Equivalent for
tho&s;e that had always &s;tood by you; that had
endur'd <HI>Mobbing; Plundering; Burning;</HI>
and all Manner of <HI>Abu&s;es</HI> for your Sakes;
Is it po&s;&s;ible that, after all this, they &s;hould

<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="104" REF="115">
be thus &s;urrender'd without one Word for
them? Who, my Lords, will depend on you
after this? Who will move a Finger or Lip
in your Quarrel? Depend upon it, you will
mi&s;s your Aim; you have ruin'd your own <HI>In|tere&s;t,</HI>
and have lo&s;t the Honour of Your for|mer
<HI>Integrity.</HI> With what Regret will you
reflect on this Day's Action, when you &s;hall
find your &s;elves the Je&s;t of tho&s;e that decoy'd
you, and the Scorn of tho&s;e that you have
abandon'd? Think of this: Repent if you
can, tho' it is too late: You can never Re|trieve
it.</P>
<P>But this is all a Digre&s;&s;ion, and with it I
&s;hall conclude this <HI>Unhappy Period:</HI> For now
the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> being &s;acrific'd to the Projects
of a <HI>Party,</HI> were given up by their Friends,
and effectually cru&s;h'd by their Enemies;
and the <HI>Occa&s;ionl Bill,</HI> which had &s;o often
in vain been attempted, and had &s;o often
ruin'd the <HI>Party</HI> that attempted it, was now
promoted by the <HI>Whiggs</HI> them&s;elves, and
pa&s;s'd without one Man Opening his Mouth
again&s;t it, to the Ruin, not of the <HI>Intere&s;t</HI>
of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> only, but to the Ruin of
the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Whiggs</HI> in general, which,
by this Means, was effectually divided and
overthrown.</P>
<P>And here, becau&s;e I have had, and &s;hall
have &s;o much Occa&s;ion to &s;peak of the &s;aid
<HI>Occa&s;ional Bill,</HI> and for that this Book may
<PB N="105" REF="116">
come to be u&s;eful in many Places, where
the &s;aid Bill is not to be &s;een, I think I can
not rationally omit giving a Summary of the
Bill it &s;elf, which is not long, and which,
in all Probability, will be the Subject of &s;o
much Contention, and &s;o many Complaints
in the World; and with this I &s;hall end the
Chapter.</P>

<P>As to the <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> the&s;e Things made ve|ry
little Alterations in the Mea&s;ures they
had taken, only drove them to the Nece&s;&s;ity
of making U&s;e of other Hands; <HI>that is to
&s;ay,</HI> That whereas they would gladly have
gone on with <HI>Moderate Mea&s;ures,</HI> and, per|haps,
with <HI>Moderate</HI> Men too, if they could
have been found, they were now oblig'd
to go more fully and effectually into the
<HI>High-Flying</HI> or <HI>Tory</HI> Mea&s;ures, and to take in
Per&s;ons of tho&s;e <HI>Principles,</HI> who, for their
Want of Temper, they had always re&s;olv'd
at lea&s;t to lay by, if not totally to drop out
of the <HI>Management.</HI></P>
<P>We are not to expect the <HI>Tories</HI> were not
Men wi&s;e enough to know when their Turn
was in, as well as other Men; that they did
not &s;ee that now was the Time when they
were particularly u&s;eful, and therefore, that
they ought to take Care of them&s;elves; that
&s;ince the Mini&s;try were not equally, as be|fore,
in a Condition to deny them any
Thing, now was the Time to make their
Demands; that now, if ever, was the Time
when they might e&s;tabli&s;h the <HI>High-Church,</HI>
and for ever trample down the Whiggs, their
<PB N="113" REF="124">
Oppo&s;ers, and that if they let it &s;lip they
were never to expert &s;uch another.</P>
<P>Pur&s;uant to this Notion, which was but too
true, they took Care to lay about them, as we
&s;hall &s;ee, and having hurry'd off the <HI>Occa&s;io|nal
Bill,</HI> and carry'd their Point in running
down the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> as you have &s;een in the
former Chapter, it behov'd them to &s;treng|then
their Alliance, by doing; &s;omething for

in cour&s;e to &s;ay &s;omething, by way of Intro|duction,
to the State of Things in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
at that Time, in which I &s;hall be as brief as
po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The <HI>Union</HI> had been but a few Years &s;ettled,
and this was but the Second <HI>Parliament</HI>
from the Joyning the Two <HI>Kingdoms</HI> in that
Great Act of <HI>Encorporation,</HI> which was made
firm and indi&s;&s;olvible, at lea&s;t as much &s;o as
was in the Power of Man's Invention to
Contrive, or of Human-Laws to Confirm;
it was the Peculiar of this <HI>Union,</HI> and what
more e&s;pecially pinch'd the <HI>Jacobite Party</HI>
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> That it &s;ettled the <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI>
Church, and the Succe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Hanover;</HI>
and as the&s;e were both incompatible with
the Intere&s;ts of that <HI>Party,</HI> either as <HI>Epi&s;co|pal</HI>
in <HI>Principles,</HI> or as <HI>Jacobite</HI> in <HI>Politicks,</HI>
they watch'd their Opportunities, on all
Occa&s;ions, to &s;upplant the One that the
Other might fall of Cour&s;e; and both the&s;e
were to be done by a Breach on the <HI>Union.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="125">
To effect this, the <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> Church
was to be attack'd fir&s;t, who&s;e Securities
were very Shocking to the <HI>Party.</HI> This
had been prepar'd for a long while by Re|ports
and Caluminies &s;pread continually
about, of the Hard&s;hips &s;uffer'd by the <HI>Epi&s;|copal
Clergy</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> under the <HI>Pre&s;byte|rian
Tyranny,</HI> who deny'd, as they pretended,
not Toleration only, in General, bur Liberty
of private A&s;&s;embling together for the Wor|&s;hip
of God to tho&s;e of differing Per&s;wa&s;ion
from them&s;elves.</P>
<P>It is too long a Work to come into this
Tract to enter into the Particulars of the
real <HI>Conduct</HI> of the Two Parties in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
arid thereby to confute the Reproaches ca&s;t
upon the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as to <HI>Per&s;e|cution,</HI>
which really had no Ground, nor
was any &s;uch Thing true in <HI>Scotland;</HI> yet
&s;ome Generals may be nece&s;&s;ary here to do
the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> Ju&s;tice in &s;o noto|rious
a Ca&s;e, to leave upon Record for our
Po&s;terity to &s;ee how notoriou&s;ly we broke
F&mdash;th with our <HI>United Brethren,</HI> and how
&s;oon we made Infractions into that <HI>Treaty,</HI>

and <HI>Pretences</HI> of <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Good Will</HI>

put upon it; and how Earne&s;t we
were to bring it to pa&s;s.</P>

Her their humble and hearty Thanks for
Her tender Regard to the Good and Wel|fare

An Act to prevent the Dangers ari|&s;ing

upon their independency, that they De|clar'd,
They could not Treat of an <HI>Union</HI> un|le&s;s
that Act was fir&s;t Repeal'd. The <HI>Engli&s;h

<P>IT is the greate&s;t Satisfaction that I have

Nicety in its own Nature that, 'till now, all
Attempts which have been made towards it, in
the Cour&s;e of above 100 Years, have prov'd,
ineffectual, and therefore I make no Doubt but
it will be &s;poke of, hereafter, to the <HI>Honour</HI>

<P>I cannot think it improper to hint the&s;e
Things, tho' it &s;eems to load me too much
with Quotations, that from the Height the&s;e
Exta&s;ies of Zeal for the Union run at the
Making thereof, we may view, with the
more Wonder, the &s;udden Turn which the
&s;ucceeding Circum&s;tances of Affairs &s;uffer'd
In this Temper, and how it could be po&s;&s;i|ble
that the &s;ame Nation, the &s;ame Parlia|ment,
and in the Reign of the &s;ame Queen,
could point all their Proceedings which re|lated
to <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;o directly again&s;t (that
People, and that <HI>Union</HI> which they had
courted and care&s;s'd in &s;uch a Manner &s;o
little a while before.</P>
<P>I know it may be reply'd, and will occur
mo&s;t naturally, in the Con&s;equence of the
Story, that mo&s;t of the&s;e Oppo&s;itions began
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and from <HI>Scotland</HI> it &s;elf, that
even the Gentry and Nobility of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as
well in Parliament as out, not agreed only
to the&s;e Things, but even made the fir&s;t Pro|po&s;als
of them, and that therefore <HI>England</HI>
could by no Means be reproach'd with it.</P>
<P>But they who con&s;ider the Nature of the
UNION, and the Circum&s;tances both of
Per&s;ons and Things, mu&s;t know, That the
Union was a Tran&s;action which the Go|vernment
<PB N="123" REF="134">
and Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as
then e&s;tabli&s;h'd and con&s;ider'd in their le|gal
e&s;tabli&s;h'd Circum&s;tances, <HI>viz.</HI> In State
entirely Independent, and Free; and in
Church wholly <HI>Pre&s;byterian.</HI></P>
<P>To &s;ay that the Nobility and Gentry of
<HI>Scotland</HI> are for an <HI>Epi&s;copal Government</HI> in
the Church, tho' we were to &s;uppo&s;e it to be
true, which, it is manife&s;t, it is not, yet, were
nothing to the Purpo&s;e, becau&s;e we Treated,
Agreed, and United with them as <HI>Pre&s;byte|rian,</HI>
and e&s;tabli&s;h'd their Church in all its
Powers and Privileges, as of Doctrine, Wor|&s;hip,
Di&s;cipline, and Government unaltera|ble

<P>No <HI>Act</HI> then can be equally National with
the <HI>Union,</HI> and to &s;ay that <HI>Scots</HI> Men bring
the&s;e Innovations upon them is rather an
Aggravation than an Extenuation of the
Thing? for the <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> Church is now
under the general Protection of the Par|liament
and the Government; and it is a
Debt, and the Duty of the Admini&s;tration

what &s;ort of People were in her own
Bowels; her <HI>Parliament</HI> or <HI>Civil-Repre&s;en|tative,</HI>
knew it; her <HI>A&s;&s;embfy,</HI> or <HI>Church-Re|pre&s;entative</HI>
knew it, and I cannot do Ju&s;tice,
even to the Latter, but by &s;aying, that mo&s;t
of the Mini&s;ters of the <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> Church,
who were for the <HI>Union,</HI> were mov'd to be
&s;o, as they took the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Government to
be a Ju&s;t and Upright Con&s;titution, by which,
after they had once Capitulated for <HI>Liberty,</HI>
they &s;hould be &s;ure to enjoy it; and by
which they &s;hould be &s;ure to be Protected
from the Violence and Encroachments of their
own Private Epi&s;copal Enemies: And if they
are Deceiv'd in this, I mu&s;t acknowledge
they are Deceiv'd in that only Thing in
which it could be &s;aid, they had ju&s;t rea&s;on
to depend upon <HI>England,</HI> To &s;ay then,
that their own People introduce this, is to
&s;peak the mo&s;t to the Di&s;advantage of the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Side that can be imagin'd; for did
they not know their own People would do
thus? And why did they Unite with us,
but to obtain a ju&s;t Protection again&s;t tho&s;e
<HI>Trators</HI> of their own, who they knew
would do thus? And why was it that they
made &s;uch Provi&s;ion for the Security of their
Church, but becau&s;e they knew they had a
Party among them&s;elve who would, if po&s;|&s;ible,
<PB N="125" REF="136">
make an Advantage out of their Con|federacy
with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Clergy to Suppre&s;s
and Invade them.</P>
<P>This re&s;pects an Error in Argument, but
let us next enquire into matter of Right
and Ju&s;tice, and the Rea&s;ons to be given in
behalf of <HI>Scotland,</HI> why the Encroachment
made, &s;hould not have been encourag'd here;
the mo&s;t plain and direct An&s;wer that &s;eems
to offer it&s;elf in this Ca&s;e, is that of the
Articles, in &s;hort expre&s;s'd thus, <HI>viz.</HI> You
ought not, becau&s;e you Articled with them
in the Treaty of <HI>Union,</HI> that you would not;
they ought not to be thus u&s;ed, becau&s;e they
Condition'd in the <HI>Union</HI> that they &s;hould
not, and if this be made clear, there &s;eems
to lie no other Argument again&s;t the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>To bring this to a clear Under&s;tanding,
nothing can be a more direct Method than
to bring the Cafe in Debate, to the Act of

<P>The&s;e Particulars &s;eem to require a little
Explanation, to bring them down to tho&s;e
Parts of the Treaty of <HI>Union,</HI> which more
particularly are under&s;tood by the <HI>Scots</HI> to
provide again&s;t the&s;e very Attempts.</P>
<P>1. The Setting up the <HI>Common-Prayer-Book</HI>
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and preventing the Di|&s;turbing
the <HI>Meetings</HI> in the Exerci&s;e of
that Wor&s;hip: this is what they call an <HI>In|novation</HI>
in the Publick Wor&s;hip; nor is it
&s;ufficient to &s;ay, that this is not brought into
the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but that the Wor|&s;hip
of the Church remains the &s;ame, &s;ince
by the Fifth Act of the Fir&s;t Parliament of
<HI>William</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> which Act al&s;o is made a
Part of the <HI>Union;</HI> this Clau&s;e which fol|lows,
and by &s;everal other Acts, likewi&s;e the
&s;aid <HI>Clau&s;e</HI> was made <HI>Perpetual</HI> and <HI>Unaltera|ble.</HI>
The UNIFORMITY, Mark the Word,
of the Wor&s;hip, Di&s;cipline, and Government
of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as then in U&s;e,
was to remain unalterable, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The <HI>Clau&s;e</HI>
runs thus: And more e&s;pecially Her Maje&s;ty,
with Advice and Con&s;ent afore&s;aid, ratifies,
proves, and for ever confirms the Fifth Act
of the Fir&s;t Parliament of King <HI>William and
Queen Mary, intituled,</HI> An Act ratifying the
Confe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Faith,</HI> and Settling <HI>Pre&s;byterian

Church Government</HI> with the <HI>Haill, other
Acts of Parliament relating thereto, in Pro&s;e|cution
of the Declaration of the E&s;tates of
this Kingdom, containing the Claim of Right;
bearing Date the Eleventh of</HI> April, <HI>One
Thou&s;and Six Hundred Eighty Nine.</HI></P>
<P>This then will admit no Di&s;pute, That
no <HI>Toleration</HI> can be given to any <HI>Innova|tion</HI>
in <HI>Wor&s;hip,</HI> tho' in private &s;eparate A&s;|&s;emblies,
without Breach of the UNIFOR|MITY
<HI>of Wor&s;hip,</HI> and for this we need go
no farther than the <HI>Pro&s;ecutions</HI> of the
<HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in <HI>England</HI> for many Years, who
were pur&s;ued, by the <HI>Church-Men,</HI> upon
what they call'd the <HI>Act of Uniformity, viz.</HI>
The Statue of <HI>Carol.</HI> II. <HI>Cap.</HI>&mdash;entituled,
<HI>An Act to pre&s;erve the Uniformity of Wor&s;hip
in the Church</HI> of England.</P>
<P>That the Setting up the <HI>Common-Prayer,
Book</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> was an <HI>Innovation</HI> in their
<HI>Wor&s;hip,</HI> could admit of no Di&s;pute, and that
&s;uch <HI>Innovation</HI> was expre&s;&s;ly Articled a|gain&s;t
in the <HI>Clau&s;e</HI> above, is as evident; &s;o
that it &s;eems very plain then, that the &s;aid
<HI>Liturgy</HI> could not be <HI>Tolerated</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI>
without a direct <HI>Breach</HI> of the <HI>Union.</HI></P>
<P>It may be argu'd, al&s;o, in Favour of the
<HI>Scots,</HI> That this was the Sen&s;e of the
Legi&s;lature at the Time of the making
this Law, and was under&s;tood on both
Sides; and this requires a little Secret
Hi&s;tory to make up the Defficiency of
<PB N="128" REF="139">
the common Opinions at this time. It was
to be ob&s;erv'd, and was very remarkable
at that time, when the <HI>Act for the Security
of the Church of</HI> Scotland was Transacting,
that two &s;orts of People Oppos'd it there.
It is nece&s;&s;ary for the Readers full Under|&s;tanding
this Matter, that he &s;hould know
that the &s;aid Act was fir&s;t Divi&s;ed by an Over|ture
for the Parliament, and then Debated
in the A&s;&s;embly, or Commi&s;&s;ion of the A&s;|&s;embly
of the Church there; upon which
Occa&s;ion it was oppbs'd in the Commi&s;&s;ion
by &s;ome Mini&s;ters, who perhaps, having le&s;s
Confidence in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> than others had,
thought nothing &s;ufficiently Secure that was
not in expre&s;s Words &s;et down, concluding
that, in an <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> Church of <HI>England</HI>
Parliament, every thing that would bear a
double Con&s;truction, would always be Con|&s;tructed
to the Di&s;advantage of the <HI>Pre&s;byte|rians</HI>
and the&s;e believing the Act not to be
&s;ufficient Security for them, would have
had a Tolleration of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liturgy
expre&s;ly Articled again&s;t for that rea&s;on.
I wi&s;h we had not &s;ince too much rea&s;on to
&s;ay the&s;e Men were too much in the Right.</P>
<P>There were another &s;ort who, e&s;pecially
in the Parliament, when the Act came there,
were again&s;t the Pa&s;&s;ing it, as Voteing it <HI>not
to be a &s;ufficient Security for the Church</HI>
who yet were them&s;elves utter Enemies to
the Church; and this was a very odd Cir|cum&s;tance,
<PB N="129" REF="140">
and of which the Author of
The Collections of the Affairs of the Union
has this Remark upon: &startq;This appeared to
be the plain De&s;ign in that, as I have al|ready
noted, the Gentlemen that &s;pake
loude&s;t for the In&s;ufficiency of the Act of
Security were not of tho&s;e People who
really were mo&s;t concerned for the Safety
of the Church of Scotland; the Objecti|ons
al&s;o, were not calculated for Amend|ments,
or Additions, but for De&s;troying
the Bill itfelf, as built on the Suppo&s;i|tion
of a Union which, they &s;aid, was a
Foundation that would not bear &s;uch a
Super&s;tructure.&endq;</P>
<P>The&s;e People al&s;o were for having the
Common-Prayer expre&s;ly, and in Words at
Length, provided again&s;t in the Act of Se|curity,
and this, not that they concern'd
them&s;elve for the Church, but becau&s;e
they took it for granted that this would not
go down in England, and that, therefore, it
would overthrow the UNION, which was
what they aim'd at; and this may &s;erve far|ther
to unriddle it, <HI>viz.</HI> That tho&s;e very
Men, or many of them, who would have
had a <HI>Clau&s;e</HI> in&s;erted in the Act of <HI>Union</HI>
again&s;t the <HI>Common-Prayer,</HI> Literally and
Expre&s;ly, and who exclaim'd again&s;t the
Act, as not a &s;ufficient Security for the Church
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> are the &s;ame who now eagerly
<PB N="130" REF="141">
pu&s;h the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> upon letting up the <HI>Com|mon-Prayer-Book</HI>
in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>However, at la&s;t the <HI>Moderate Men</HI> pre|vailing,
the Act of <HI>Security</HI> was pa&s;s'd in
Parliament, and &s;uch <HI>Clau&s;es</HI> were put in,
tho' not the Word <HI>Common-Prayer</HI> expre&s;s'd,
as the Members thought effectually &s;hut
out the Po&s;&s;ibility of Setting up the <HI>Com|mon-Prayer,</HI>
if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had any Sen&s;e of
Honour in them, and would have the lea&s;t
Regard to the true De&s;ign of the Act, as well
as to the Literal Sen&s;e; and they thought
that by how much the more Tender they
were of their <HI>Brethren</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> in not
putting in the Words <HI>Liturgy,</HI> or <HI>Common-Prayer,</HI>
by &s;o much the more Honourable
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> would be to them in any future
Con&s;tructions, becau&s;e they knew the
Grounds on which they had gone, and how
they had an&s;we'd for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to the
di&s;&s;atisfy'd People.</P>
<P>But Sen&s;e of <HI>Honour,</HI> and ju&s;t Allowance
to a <HI>Generous Confidence,</HI> however at other
Times they may take Place, at a Time when
a Nation is po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with Prejudices, and
guided by Parties, the&s;e Things are not
heard.</P>
<P>However, becau&s;e the&s;e two Contradicti|ons
may &s;tand ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to one another,
I think the room well taken up to incert
here the &s;aid <HI>Church Act</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> which,
the Words <HI>Common-Prayer</HI> and Toleration
<PB N="131" REF="142">
excepted, is as full as the Wit of Man can
invent, and if the other Act pa&s;&s;es the En|gli&s;h
Parliament, for, at the Writing, of this,
it is yet Depending before the Lords, I &s;hall
either recite or abridge that al&s;o, and then
draw &s;ome brief Remarks from the Whole.
The Act of <HI>Security</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> runs thus:</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Here follows the Tenour of the Act for Se|curing
the Prote&s;tant Religion, and

This, I &s;ay, is a mo&s;t convincing Proof
that even the <HI>Church of England</HI> thought
this Act of <HI>Security</HI> an effectual &s;ufficient

<P>But what can be made &s;o Strong and

find they are at a Lo&s;s for an Occa&s;ion.
What the Pretences which were made the

how weak, ill-grounded, and how incon|&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>Treaty of Union</HI> will appear
in the following Part of this Work; but
fir&s;t it may be nece&s;&s;ary to give a Summary
<HI>Account</HI> of the Juncture in which the&s;e
Things happen'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Church of Scotland</HI> had had little or
no Concern in all the <HI>Politick Bu&s;tle</HI> at
Court, of which we have an Account in the
preceeding Chapter, other than as the <HI>Scots,</HI>
influenc'd by the People here of their own
Nation, fell too much in with the Hurry
Things were in at the Election of the <HI>Par|liament</HI>
afore&s;aid. The <HI>Commoners</HI> of that
Parliament were not &s;o effectually chang'd,
and a great many of the Old People came
into the Hou&s;e, &s;o that the <HI>Whiggs</HI> might
be &s;aid to have the Majority. But the
<PB N="138" REF="149">
Election of Peers went quite another Way,
and being manag'd by the D&mdash;of <HI>A</HI>&mdash;<HI>le</HI>
and his Two clo&s;e Allies <HI>J</HI>&mdash;<HI>a</HI> and <HI>M</HI>&mdash;-<HI>r,</HI>
they made a Li&s;t of &s;uch as they thought
proper, and rather nam'd them to the Ge|neral
Meeting of the No&mdash;ty, than gave
them a Freedom of Choice. It is true, this
was not without a 'warm Opposition; and
had not many been &s;o aw'd in it by the
Conduct, the Menaces, and the other Ma|nagement
of a <HI>P</HI>&mdash;<HI>ty,</HI> it had not been ea&s;ie
to have brought the <HI>Scots</HI> Nobility in|to
an Election &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with their
L&mdash;s in that Manner, and &s;o di&s;honou|rable
to them in the Introduction: But this
was no Time to complain, or, at lea&s;t, to be

for their Relief all over <HI>England;</HI> which
they did with great Succe&s;s, if their own
Boa&s;ts may be believ'd, I mean the Boa&s;ts of
the <HI>English Clergy,</HI> in which, however this
Difficulty lies before us, that if the <HI>Engli&s;h
Clergy</HI> receiv'd what many of them boa&s;ted
of, it ill agreed with the Accounts of what
the <HI>Scots Clergy</HI> really receiv'd from them,
&s;ince this Author having &s;een the Books
which the Per&s;ons appointed in <HI>Scotland</HI> to re|ceive

the World may hear further in Time.</P>
<P>In the&s;e Collections great Exclamations

Charity of the People on one Hand, but as
&s;eem'd by their manner more &s;till on the o|ther

in their Hands, and how, altho' they made
loud Clamours here, upon the lea&s;t Inva&s;ion of

<PB N="144" REF="155">
I &s;aid in the Clo&s;e of the la&s;t Chapter, we
ought to enquire into two Things:</P>
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>1. Into the true State of the Conduct of
the <HI>Pre&s;byterian Church</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> to
the Di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s'd <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> People, and

Intere&s;t there, and the Conduct of
the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> towards the E&s;tabli&s;h'd
Church.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q>
<P>1. <HI>Into the true State of the Conduct of
the</HI> Pre&s;byterian Church <HI>in</HI> Scotland, <HI>to the
Di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s'd</HI> Epi&s;copal <HI>People, and to their
Mini&s;ters.</HI> In order to this we &s;hall go
back to the <HI>Revolution</HI> only; for there, and
not before, the <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> had Power to
act as a Body As &s;oon as the Prince of
<HI>Orange</HI> was Landed in <HI>England,</HI> King <HI>James</HI>
Fled, and the <HI>Tyranny</HI> and <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ion</HI> of that
Reign &s;eem'd to have an End; when the
<HI>Convention</HI> of E&s;tates of Scotland were a&s;|&s;embled
by the Encouragement of, and De|claration
from the &s;aid Prince: The People
took Arms in <HI>Scotland</HI> for the Recovery of
their <HI>Liberties,</HI> as they had done in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>It may be true, that when the People
were thus Univer&s;ally free, and Arms were
in the Hands of the Common People, that
they immediately apply'd them&s;elve in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> as they in <HI>England</HI> had &s;hew'd
<PB N="145" REF="156">
them the Way, to rid them&s;elves of the
<HI>Popi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> Party, who had &s;o
bloodily Rul'd them, been a Terror to them;
had put &s;o many of them to Torments and
Death; and to whom, as well as to their
Profe&s;&s;ion in Religion, <HI>viz. Epi&s;copacy,</HI> or
<HI>Prelacy,</HI> they had the utmo&s;t Aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>And con&s;idering that there were few Fami|lies
left but &s;ome of who&s;e near Friends had
been put to Death, Bani&s;h'd, Tortur'd, or Plun|der'd,
and Impoveri&s;h'd by that very <HI>Party,</HI> and
&s;ome by the &s;ame Per&s;ons then Living among
them, it &s;eems rather to be wonder'd that,
when the <HI>Common People</HI> had the full Liberty
of <HI>Treating</HI> them as they pleas'd, they did
not tear them to Pieces, than that they did
di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s and drive them from among them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Church of England Men</HI> in <HI>England</HI>
cannot joyn in that Exclamation again&s;t the
Poor People of <HI>Scotland</HI> for the Extravagan|cies
of their &s;aid Rabbles at that Time, &s;ince
the Rabbles, and Tumults in <HI>England,</HI> tho'
having by no Means the Pretence of like
Provocation, exercis'd much more <HI>Violence</HI>
and <HI>Fury</HI> on the &s;ame Occa&s;ion, &s;uch as Pil|laging
the Hou&s;es of Foreign Amba&s;&s;adors;
Laying wa&s;te the Fields and Parks of the
Gentry, and Plundering the Dwelling-Hou&s;es of many who had no Concern in
the Oppre&s;&s;ion of King <HI>James</HI>'s Reign; but
that, by the Way, only to our People in
<HI>England,</HI> it may be &s;aid, that it is <HI>ad Hominem</HI>
<PB N="146" REF="157">
to them, and may &s;erve effectually to &s;top
their Mouths in this Matter.</P>
<P>But, to come to the Point, in this Tu|mult,
upon the fir&s;t Heat of the <HI>Revolution,</HI>
it is acknowledg'd, That in the We&s;t of
<HI>Scotland, viz.</HI> in the Shires of <HI>Air, Galway,
Dumfries,</HI> &amp;c. the <HI>Curates,</HI> or <HI>Epi&s;copal Clergy</HI>
were, <HI>brevi manu,</HI> Di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, turn'd Out,
and &s;ent away from their Livings, not En|quiring
whether they would Conform to
the future E&s;tabli&s;hment or no: For in that
Heat, as is mo&s;t natural to &s;uppo&s;e, the En|quiry
was rather what they had been, than
what they would promi&s;e to be hereafter:
This is Acknowledging as much as the
wor&s;t Enemy can charge; and all the loude&s;t
Clamour which they make of the Violence
of the Rabble again&s;t &s;ome of tho&s;e Mini&s;ters
might be thus an&s;wer'd from them&s;elves, if
they would &s;incerely, from their Con&s;ciences,
a&s;k, and reply uprightly to this Que&s;tion;
1. Reflecting on the U&s;age the Poor People
had &s;uffer'd; the Per&s;ecution they had under|gone;
the Blood that had been &s;pilt, and the
Lo&s;&s;es they had &s;u&s;tain'd; to which even ma|ny
of the&s;e Mini&s;ters had been a&s;&s;i&s;tant and
acce&s;&s;ory; and, con&s;idering the unre&s;train'd
Power the Poor People at that Time had
Whether they did not wonder that they
came off &s;o well, and whether the Mini&s;ters
of that Side did not expect much wor&s;e from
their Hands? And 2. Whether the <HI>Church of
<PB N="147" REF="158">
England</HI> Rabbles, at the &s;ame Time, and upon
the &s;ame Occa&s;ion, did not commit a Thou|&s;and
greater Violences, and more extravagant,
tho' with far le&s;s Provocation? The&s;e are, as
I &s;aid above, <HI>ad Hominem</HI> in this Ca&s;e: And
after all that has been complain'd of, this is
certain, and to me, I confe&s;s, no le&s;s won|derful
that there was no Blood &s;hed, no Life,
lo&s;t in the whole Affair; which, if the Tables
were turn'd, as God forbid, and the other
Party were uppermo&s;t, and had the &s;ame
Power, I believe the Gentlemen we are
Speaking of would not an&s;wer for.</P>
<P>In this Hurry therefore, as I &s;aid before,
&s;everal of the <HI>Epi&s;copal Mini&s;ters</HI> were turn'd
out of their Pari&s;hes and Livings by Vio|lence,
and it was a Wonder it was no wor&s;e.
But this can by no means be laid to the
Charge of the <HI>Pre&s;byterian Church Settlement,</HI>
for they were not &s;ettled or e&s;tabli&s;h'd in any
Legal Form 'till the Year after, <HI>viz.</HI> the Year
1689, when the Fifth Act of the Second
Se&s;&s;ion of the Fir&s;t Parliament of <HI>William</HI> and
<HI>Mary,</HI> entituled, <HI>Act Ratifying the Confe&s;&s;ion
of Faith, and Settling</HI> Pre&s;byterian Church
Government, was pa&s;s'd in <HI>Scotland.</HI> Now
let us enquire critically into the Conduct of
the <HI>Church</HI> as <HI>Pre&s;byterian,</HI> and as ve&s;ted
with <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Juri&s;diction,</HI> and then, if
any Appearance of <HI>Per&s;ecution</HI> is to be found,
it will lie fairly again&s;t them. The fir&s;t
Act after the Settlement of the <HI>Pre&s;byterian
<PB N="148" REF="159">
Church</HI> was, indeed, to empower all the&s;e
Mini&s;ters of the <HI>Pre&s;byterian Church</HI> who
were po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of Livings at the Re&s;toration,
(1661) and were turn'd out, and were then
Living, to return and repo&s;&s;e&s;s them. This
was but an Act of Ju&s;tice to re&s;tore Men to
tho&s;e Rights from which (by their Con&s;ti|tution)
they &s;uppos'd them violently and un|ju&s;tly
thrown out: But, alas! If this be the
Per&s;ecution they mean, how few, could it be
&s;uppos'd, were to be found, which the Gal|lows,
the Tortures, the Murtherings in cold
Blood, the Drowning, the Bani&s;hment of the
<HI>Epi&s;copal Per&s;ecutors,</HI> had left alive; or who,
in 28 Years Time, for &s;o long the Reign of
<HI>Epi&s;copal Cruelty</HI> la&s;ted, were not worn out
by Age, and &s;ent to Re&s;t in their Graves, &s;o
that I believe I &s;peak within Compa&s;s if I
&s;ay that not Fifty <HI>Pre&s;byterian Mini&s;ters</HI>
were to be found who claim'd the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of Benefices by that Act.</P>
<P>The <HI>Church</HI> being now &s;ettled, even the
Nature of the Thing prevented them ha&s;tily
Turning out the <HI>Epi&s;copal Mini&s;ters</HI> for
Twenty Eight Years Per&s;ecution, and e&s;pe|cially
a Per&s;ecution &s;o cruel, and &s;o &s;evere,
had worn out even the Race of <HI>Pre&s;byterian
Pa&s;tors,</HI> and there were not enough to be
found to &s;upply the <HI>Churches;</HI> this, I &s;ay,
even by the Nature of the Thing, prevent|ed
any immediate general Pro&s;ecution of the
De&s;ign for Di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the <HI>Epi&s;copal Mi|ni&s;ters;</HI>
<PB N="149" REF="160">
but, after this, as a Te&s;timony of
the <HI>Moderation</HI> of a <HI>Pre&s;byterian Government,</HI>
and to &s;hew them that nothing but a ju&s;t
Settlement of Things was aim'd at, with as
little Oppre&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Epi&s;copal Mini&s;ters</HI> as
was po&s;&s;ible, an <HI>Act</HI> of Parliament was pa&s;s'd,
<HI>viz.</HI> The 27th <HI>Act</HI> of the Fifth Se&s;&s;ion of
the Fir&s;t Paliament of King <HI>William</HI> and
Queen <HI>Mary, Anno</HI> 1695, and entitl'd, <HI>Act
concerning the Church;</HI> by which all <HI>Epi&s;co|pal
Mini&s;ters</HI> who were po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of Livings
and Benefices in <HI>Scotland</HI> were allow'd to
continue in the &s;ame upon no other Condi|tions
but tho&s;e of Living peaceably under,
and Taking the Oaths to the <HI>Government.</HI>
Now let any In&s;tance of a like <HI>Moderation</HI>
be given in any Parallel Ca&s;e in the World;
and let any Man judge of the Charge of Per|&s;ecution
ca&s;t upon the <HI>Church of Scotland,</HI>
After &s;uch Dealings and &s;uch Connivance.
Here was not &s;o much as an Acknowledg|ment
of, or <HI>Subjection</HI> to the <HI>Pre&s;byterian
Church Government,</HI> no Sub&s;cription to <HI>Pre&s;|byterian
Articles of Faith,</HI> or to any Thing
incon&s;i&s;tent with their own Principles re|quir'd
of them, as is u&s;ual in all &s;uch Ca&s;es in
other Countries, and is e&s;pecially in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Pur&s;uant to this Act, a Sixth part of all
the Pari&s;hes in <HI>Scotland</HI> were left in the
Hands of the <HI>Epi&s;copal Mini&s;ters</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
and the Few Removes made by Death being
Excepted, they continue &s;o &s;till; and &s;o far
<PB N="150" REF="161">
are the &s;aid <HI>Epi&s;copal Mini&s;ters</HI> from paying
any Homage of Principles to the E&s;tabli&s;h'd
<HI>Church,</HI> that, on the contrary, they own and
continue them&s;elves <HI>Epi&s;copal;</HI> and the <HI>Pre&s;by|terians</HI>
a&s;&s;emble in private Meetings-Hou&s;es
in &s;ome of the &s;ame Towns under them, like
meer <HI>Di&s;&s;enters:</HI> This is a Token of Forbear|ance
that, I pre&s;ume, no e&s;tabli&s;h'd Church
in <HI>Europe,</HI> this alone excepted, can give an
Example of.</P>
<P>But this is not all: That the <HI>Church</HI> of
<HI>England</HI> may be yet more a&s;ham'd to charge
the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> with being &s;o much
a <HI>Per&s;ecutor</HI> as her&s;elf, we have another In|&s;tance
which is very clear, and pa&s;t all po&s;|&s;iblity
of denying: The <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> People
who were Di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s'd for refu&s;ing to take
the Oaths to the <HI>Government,</HI> &s;oon after this
let up Meetings in all Parts of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in
which they not only &s;et up <HI>Publick Wor&s;hip,</HI>
and gather'd Congregations, and in &s;ome
Few (<HI>very Few</HI>) the <HI>Common-Prayer,</HI> all
which was directly contrary to the Laws
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the Privileges of the <HI>Church,</HI>
and which the <HI>Church</HI> might very readily,
and ju&s;tly have &s;uppre&s;s'd; but in none, or
very few of the&s;e would they ever Pray for
the Queen; in many of them they open|ly
Pray'd for the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and in all of
them they pray'd in ambigu$ous Terms,
&s;uch as might clearly evidence that they
meant the <HI>Pretender,</HI> &s;uch as praying for
<PB N="151" REF="162">
<HI>the King,</HI> or <HI>the Queen,</HI> or <HI>the Royal Family,</HI>
and the like; and yet, even for this, did not
the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> take the lea&s;t Cog|ni&s;ance,
or offer them any Di&s;turbance, tho',
at the &s;ame Time, the like <HI>Jacobite</HI> Meetings
were, generally &s;peaking, Suppre&s;s'd, Di|&s;turb'd,
and effectually Scatter'd in <HI>England,</HI>
without the lea&s;t Complaint, or clamour of
<HI>Per&s;ecution;</HI> nor, to this Day, are they al|low'd
among us. I am the freer to take up
&s;ome time on this Head, becau&s;e I cannot but
think that the Hone&s;t, but prejudic'd People
in <HI>England,</HI> who have been impo&s;ed upon, by
the publick Cryes of <HI>Sufferings, Per&s;ecution,
Cruelties,</HI> and Mercile&s;s <HI>U&s;age</HI> of the <HI>Epi&s;|copal
Party</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> will, I doubt not,
be plea&s;ed to be undeceiv'd, and be glad to
re&s;tore the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to their
entire Charity and good Opinion, and to
have that Damp remov'd, which they had
on good Ground, as they &s;uppos'd, felt on
their Thoughts, when they believ'd, that
the Exce&s;&s;es pretended to, had Truth enough
in them to merit real Blame, and that the
Warmth of <HI>Northern Zeal</HI> had carry'd the
<HI>Scots</HI> beyond that Moderation, which is
the Beauty and Glory of the <HI>Prote&s;tant
Religion,</HI> and which I doubt not to make
appear, the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> has given
Rea&s;on to believe, &s;he at this time practi&s;es,

to clear up the Reputation of the Church of
<HI>Scotland</HI> among her Friends, not among her
Enemies, among the Friends to Religion in
<HI>England,</HI> and among the <HI>Prote&s;tant Churches</HI>
abroad; this is the Rea&s;on of this Work,
and the Author profe&s;&s;es to have no other
De&s;ign.</P>
<P>Not but that it may al&s;o &s;erve to &s;top the
Mouths of &s;ome People who, with an <HI>Uncha|ritable
Zeal,</HI> have rais'd a Cloud, and ca&s;t Dirt
on the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> on
this Account, and perhaps they may here
find &s;ome Occa&s;ion to alter their Mea&s;ures,
and with re&s;pect to their own Reputation
change their Note: For it always weakens
the Reputation of either Per&s;on or Party, to
a&s;&s;ert <HI>Fal&s;hoods,</HI> to rai&s;e <HI>Stories</HI> that mu&s;t, if
Examin'd into, appear to be forged, and con|trived
only to Defame. And that this may
be effectually done, I &s;hall &s;et down a &s;hort
Ab&s;tract of the Proceedings of the <HI>Church,</HI>
with relation to their own Settlement, taken
from &s;ufficient Authorities, as follows:</P>
<P>The <HI>Government</HI> was no &s;ooner E&s;ta|bli&s;h'd
by the <HI>Revolution,</HI> and the <HI>Kirk</HI>
<PB N="153" REF="164">
Re&s;tor'd to her <HI>Judicatories</HI> and <HI>Authority,</HI>
but her &s;everal Courts as <HI>Se&s;&s;ion, Pre&s;bytery,
Synod,</HI> and <HI>A&s;&s;embly,</HI> took their Cour&s;es and
began to Act.</P>
<P>By the fir&s;t Act of Parliament for &s;et|tling
the&s;e Matters, pa&s;s'd <HI>June</HI> 7. 1690,
Intituled, <HI>Act Ratifying the Confe&s;&s;ion of
Faith, and Settling Pre&s;byterian Church
Government,</HI> It is Ordain'd, <HI>That the Ge|neral
A&s;&s;embly the Mini&s;ters and Elders,
&s;hould have Power to try and purge out all</HI>
In&s;ufficient, Scandalous <HI>and</HI> Erroneous Mi|ni&s;ters,
<HI>by due Cour&s;e of Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Pro|ce&s;s,
and Cen&s;ures;</HI> But this Act no where
Impower'd them to Cen&s;ure any who were
not <HI>In&s;ufficient, Scandalous</HI> or <HI>Erroneous,</HI>
tho' they would not take the Oaths to the
<HI>Government.</HI> So that, by this Law, the
Church could not be capable of <HI>Per&s;ecution.</HI></P>
<P>It may be objected here, That to be <HI>Epi&s;|copal,</HI>
might be adjudged <HI>Erroneous</HI> by this
<HI>Judicatory,</HI> and &s;o come under the Church
Cen&s;ure, by Authority of this Act.</P>
<P>To this 'tis Replyed. Fir&s;t, <HI>In Fact,</HI> No
Man was ever &s;ince the <HI>Revolution,</HI> Depo&s;ed
by the Church, meerly for being <HI>Epi&s;copal,</HI>
nor was any Proce&s;s ever commenc'd again&s;t
any Man on that Foundation.</P>
<P>And here by the way, if this be true, as I
can challenge the World to contradict it, I
would humbly recommend it to tho&s;e Gen|tlemen
who are now in <HI>England</HI> rai&s;ing
<PB N="154" REF="165">
<HI>Charities,</HI> and obtaining <HI>Contributions,</HI> preten|ing
it is for the Relief of the Poor Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed
Epi&s;copal Clergy in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who are &s;uf|fering
<HI>Per&s;ecution,</HI> to tell the World, what
it is they are per&s;ecuted for.</P>
<P>And the Gentlemen who be&s;tow their
<HI>Charity,</HI> would do well to require &s;ome
Documents or Certificates of them, to prove
the Particulars; And e&s;pecially one exceed|ing
bu&s;y <HI>Solicitor</HI> for tho&s;e <HI>Charities,</HI> and
who &s;tiles him&s;elf a <HI>Per&s;ecuted Epi&s;copal
Mini&s;ter,</HI> who&s;e Name may in time be
made more publick, would do well to tell
them, whether he was <HI>Deprived,</HI> which he
calls <HI>Per&s;ecution,</HI> for his <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> or his
<HI>Vice;</HI> for his <HI>Religion,</HI> or for his <HI>Morals;</HI>
for <HI>Epi&s;copacy,</HI> or for Relap&s;e <HI>Fornication.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>Secondly,</HI> To put this out of Que&s;tion,
it was particularly Declared by the Fir&s;t
General A&s;&s;embly after the Revolution, <HI>viz.</HI>
In the Sixth Se&s;&s;ion, in the Year 1690, <HI>That
this A&s;&s;embly will Depo&s;e no Incumbents &s;im|ply
for their Judgment anent the Government
of the Church, nor Urge Re-ordination upon
them. Vid. Index</HI> of the Unprinted Acts of
the A&s;&s;embly, <HI>Se&s;&s;.</HI> 6. 1690.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame A&s;&s;embly, in their In&s;tructi|ons
given to their Commi&s;&s;ion, which was
to &s;it during their Rece&s;s, we have the&s;e
Words,</P>
<P>That they be very Cautious of receiv|ing
Informations again&s;t the late Conformi&s;ts;
<PB N="155" REF="166">
And that they proceed in the Matter of Cen|&s;ure
very Deliberately, &s;o as none may have
Ju&s;t Cau&s;e to Complain of their Regedity;
And that they &s;hall not proceed to Cen&s;ure, but
upon <HI>Relevant Libels</HI> and Sufficieut Probation,
<HI>Act 15th. Se&s;&s;. 26th, A&s;&s;embly</HI> 1690.</P>
<P>Again, le&s;t the <HI>Pre&s;byteries</HI> &s;hould be Ra&s;h
or Severe, the Commi&s;&s;ion is impower'd as
follows, That if they &s;hall be inform'd of any
precipitant Procedure of the <HI>Pre&s;byteries</HI> in
&s;uch Proce&s;&s;es, to Re&s;train them. Vid. <HI>the
&s;ame Act as above.</HI></P>
<P>If then they were thus Moderate even in
Scandalous Things, and Declared again&s;t
proceeding ha&s;tily or &s;everely in Ca&s;es meer|ly
<HI>Epi&s;copal,</HI> where &s;hall we find the Article
of <HI>Per&s;ecution?</HI></P>
<P>'Tis true, That, in the Year 1693, an Act
of Parliament was made to Deprive all &s;uch
Mini&s;ters as would not both Swear to the
<HI>Government,</HI> and Acknowledge the <HI>Church
Government</HI> al&s;o, and the <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith.</HI>
But the Occa&s;ion of this Act is Vi&s;ible to all
that know the Affairs of that Time, that it
was pa&s;s'd to &s;atisfy the Minds of the People,
who were exceedingly Di&s;turb'd at the
Church's having been In&s;ulted in the A&s;&s;em|bly
1692, by a general <HI>Formula,</HI> procured by
the <HI>Epi&s;copal Clergy,</HI> together with their Ap|peal
to the King on a Refu&s;al: And the A&s;|&s;embly
being abruptly Di&s;&s;olved, or Di&s;mi&s;&s;ed
<HI>&s;ine die,</HI> which put the Nation in a very
great Fermentation.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="167">
Yet, upon this Act, I may challenge the
<HI>Epi&s;copal Clergy</HI> to &s;how me one Mini&s;ter,
that ever was Depo&s;ed for not acknowledg|ing
the <HI>Church,</HI> if at the &s;ame he offer'd to
acknowledge the <HI>Government,</HI> and take the
Oaths, and they have been often challenged
on this Head.</P>
<P>And to confirm this Lenity of Practice
by a Law, that Famous Act of Parliament
was made in the Year 1695, wherein taking
the Oaths to the Government is made the
<HI>Only</HI> and <HI>Fully Sufficient</HI> Qualification, and
all Mini&s;ters that would &s;o <HI>Qualifie them|&s;elves</HI>
are continued. As may be &s;een at
large by the Act, Intituled, Act <HI>concerning
the Church, Anno</HI> 1695.</P>
<P>This very Act of Parliament, if I were to
go no further, effectually clears the Church
of <HI>Scotland</HI> from the Charge of <HI>Per&s;ecution;</HI>
&s;ince 'tis plain there was no religious Tenet
in Di&s;pute, but a civil Que&s;tion of owning
or not owning the <HI>Government.</HI></P>
<P>It was by this Act of Parliament taken
quite out of the Power of the <HI>Church,</HI> to
Depo&s;e any Man meerly for being <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI>
in <HI>Principle,</HI> or for refu&s;ing to own the <HI>Pre&s;|byterian</HI>
Church; nay, the <HI>Epi&s;copal Clergy</HI>
who, by virtue of this Act, remain in their
Livings, many of them to this Day, refu&s;e
to acknowledge the <HI>Church,</HI> to &s;ubmit to
any of Her <HI>Judicatories,</HI> or to joyn, either
in <HI>Di&s;cipline</HI> or <HI>Wor&s;hip;</HI> and yet, in all their
<PB N="157" REF="168">
Affronts of the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church, they
continue in their Paroches, preaching and
u&s;ing all their Formalities; however, con|trary
to the Inclinations and De&s;ires of the
People.</P>
<P>The <HI>Church</HI>'s power to Per&s;ecute, being
thus limited by Act of Parliament, it remains
to examine, in what manner &s;he has exer|cis'd
that Power &s;he had; for in this Article
mu&s;t lie the Matter of this Charge, or they
mu&s;t have more than a Spirit of Divination
that can find it out.</P>
<P>In order to this, I mu&s;t enquire what this
Power they had was, and that is a very
&s;hort Q$e&s;tion: Their Power, 'tis plain,
was only again&s;t &s;uch Mini&s;ters who were
<HI>Scandalous,</HI> &amp;c. or would not take the Oaths
to the <HI>Government,</HI> nor pray for King <HI>Wil|liam</HI>
and Queen <HI>Mary.</HI></P>
<P>Whether they were, or were not ab&s;olute|ly
bound up to Cen&s;ure all &s;uch as would
not thus qualifie them&s;elves, is a Que&s;tion I
&s;hall &s;peak to hereafter.</P>
<P>It follows to Examine how the <HI>Church</HI>
has Executed this Power; and whether
<HI>Lenity</HI> or <HI>Severity</HI> has been her Temper in
the Ca&s;e; and to &s;tate this, as clearly as po&s;|&s;ible,
I mu&s;t make the Gentlemen one fair
Propo&s;al.</P>
<P>Before I enter'd upon this Work, I not
only &s;earch'd into all the Publick Records
of this Matter, which I could have Acce&s;s
<PB N="158" REF="169">
to, but made as &s;trict Enquiry, as po&s;&s;ibly I
could, of the mo&s;t Impartial and Unbya&s;s'd
Per&s;ons for any particular Ca&s;e, wherein any
Excurtion might have been beyond this
Power, or wherein the Charge of <HI>Per&s;ecution</HI>
might lie. And this with the utmo&s;t Im|partiality,
and not being able to find any
Thing.</P>
<P>Thus &s;tands the Article of the Behaviour
of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> towards the <HI>Epi&s;|copal</HI>
Di&s;&s;enters, even at the Time when we
are now pa&s;&s;ing at Act of Parliament to pre|vent
the &s;aid <HI>Church</HI> per&s;ecuting the other.
Hour far, even the <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> People them|&s;elves
will think fit to Laugh at that Pre|tence,
brought into the Title of a Law, I
leave to them; no doubt but it is Diverting
enough to them to have &s;o effectually impos'd
upon us in <HI>England</HI> about the&s;e Things.</P>
<P>It might have been needful to have Incer|ted
here the Names of the Per&s;ons now en|joying
Pari&s;hes and Benefices in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
who yet are <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> in their Per&s;wa&s;ion,
and who do not acknowledge the <HI>Pre&s;byterian
Church Government,</HI> and yet are continu'd,
with the Names of the Pari&s;hes, the Number
of which were at fir&s;t 163, and are &s;till, Death
having, in Twenty Two Years time, taken
many away, above 100: But having not
room in this Tract, and having publi&s;h'd the
&s;ame Li&s;t in another &s;mall Tract; as al&s;o
the <HI>Church</HI> Regi&s;ters being always capable of
<PB N="159" REF="170">
proving the Fact, I omit it, referring the In|credulous
to inform them&s;elves of any that
are Conver&s;ant at <HI>Edinb.</HI> and appealing even
to the <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> Mini&s;ters them&s;elves, who
I believe will not deny it.</P>
<P>2. I proceed in the next Place, to examine
the Conduct and Behaviour of the <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI>
People in <HI>Scotland,</HI> in return for the For|bearance
and Lenity above; and for the
more clear di&s;covery of this, I think no
better Method can be taken to refer to the
Behaviour of the Gentry and People in the
Affair of <HI>Church Judicatories, Civil Proce&s;s,</HI>
and the like, wherein the <HI>Epi&s;copal Clergy</HI> are
concern'd, and in the Judical Proceedings of
the <HI>Church</HI> in planting vacant Churches, &s;et|tling
Mini&s;ters, and the like; as al&s;o about
Intru&s;ion into Churches, Man&s;es, or Par&s;on|age-Hou&s;es,
and the like.</P>
<P>In general it is well known, that all po&s;|&s;ible
<HI>Oppo&s;ition,</HI> In&s;ults of <HI>Publick Judicature,</HI>
Contempt of <HI>Di&s;cipline</HI> and <HI>Government,</HI> even
to <HI>Violence,</HI> breach of the <HI>Laws,</HI> breach of
the <HI>Peace. Rabble, Tumult,</HI> and <HI>Barbarity</HI>
has been the Return made by the <HI>Epi&s;copal
Party,</HI> for the <HI>Lenity</HI> and <HI>Forbearance</HI> afore|&s;aid;
and this in &s;everal Particulars, too
long to recite here: yet I cannot agree to pa&s;s
&s;uch a General, without entering into &s;ome
Particulars, in order to make a Proof of
the Whole; le&s;t affirming, in gro&s;s may be
thought &s;ufficiently an&s;wer'd, by denying in
<PB N="160" REF="171">
Gro&s;s; wherefore, that the Thing may car|ry
its own Evidence with it&s;elf, I &s;hall give
One or Two In&s;tances out of many that
might be named to confirm this Head.</P>
<P>But before I de&s;cend to the&s;e Particulars,
it is fir&s;t requi&s;ite to note from whence the&s;e
<HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> Men took Encouragement to this
Way of Behaviour under an e&s;tabli&s;h'd <HI>Con|&s;titution,</HI>
and again&s;t &s;evere <HI>Laws</HI> made a|gain&s;t
them; which <HI>Laws,</HI> had they been
rigorou&s;ly Executed, mu&s;t have effectually
&s;uppre&s;s'd them long ago. In order to this,
it is nece&s;&s;ary to note, That, during the
Reign of King <HI>William,</HI> all their De&s;igns
meeting with a vi&s;ible Di&s;couragement, they
&s;aw little Hopes of breaking thorough the
<HI>Con&s;titution,</HI> and therefore were le&s;s frequent
in their Attempts; and acted with more
Mode&s;ty and Caution in their Encroachments
upon the <HI>Rights</HI> and <HI>Privileges</HI> of the <HI>Na|tional
Church;</HI> nor had they many Meet|ing-Hou&s;es
erected in that Reign. Indeed,
the Act of Parliament 1695, allowing all to
keep their Pari&s;hes and Stations in the <HI>Mi|ni&s;try</HI>
tho' they were <HI>Epi&s;copal,</HI> provided
they would take the Oaths to the <HI>Govern|ment,</HI>
of which I made mention before, took
away from them all appearance of rea&s;on for
their <HI>Di&s;contents;</HI> for no <HI>Government</HI> could
think it rea&s;onable to allow a Liberty to
tho&s;e who, at the &s;ame time, refu&s;ed to give
rea&s;onable A&s;&s;urances of their Fidelity to
<PB N="161" REF="172">
that <HI>Government,</HI> and therefore, in that
Reign they lay pretty Quite, hoping, as they
&s;aid, for better Times.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was King <HI>William</HI> in his Grave,
but they began to take Courage; and enter|taining
new Hopes, from, the fir&s;t Advances
made in the beginning of Her Maje&s;ty's Reign
towards a <HI>High-Party</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> of which
I have &s;poken at large in the fir&s;t Chapter,
they promis'd them&s;elves great Things,
and began to make &s;ome Steps towards
Mea&s;ures they had in view.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Step they took, wad to make
their Court to the <HI>Church of England,</HI> call|ing
them&s;elves, <HI>their Si&s;ter Church,</HI> of the
&s;ame Profe&s;&s;ion, and per&s;ecuted by <HI>Pre&s;byte|rians,</HI>
for adhereing to the <HI>Principles</HI> which
the <HI>Church of England</HI> profe&s;s'd; and, that
this might appear more and more, they ap|ply'd
them&s;elves to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bi&s;hops, pro|mi&s;ing
them to introduce the <HI>Engli&s;h Litur|gy</HI>
into <HI>Scotland;</HI> and to that Purpo&s;e re|ceiv'd
from the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI> large num|bers
of <HI>Common-Prayer-Books,</HI> as a Charita|ble
<HI>Contribution, ad propoganda &s;ide,</HI> to be
given among the poor Peaple, whom they,
<HI>tho' fal&s;ly,</HI> repre&s;ented eagerly de&s;iring that
Holy-Book, and very forward to Receive and
Embrace it; tho' nothing is more true, than
this, that when they had it in the <HI>North</HI> and
<HI>Ea&s;t</HI> Parts of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Chiefs and Lairds
us'd all manner of Violences to bring their
<PB N="162" REF="173">
Subjects and Va&s;&s;als to make u&s;e of it; of
which hereafter.</P>
<P>This was the fir&s;t Step: But, as this was
not the End aim'd at; this new Corre&s;pon|dence
was &s;oon improv'd to a mo&s;t incon&s;i|&s;tent
Attempt, and which one would have
thought their New-Corre&s;pondents might
have inform'd them of the Impo&s;&s;ibility of
bringing to any Head, <HI>viz.</HI> of Addre&s;&s;ing
Her Maje&s;ty, by Her own Authority (<HI>i. e.</HI>
Di&s;pen&s;ing Power) to give them a Tolera|tion
again&s;t Law: The An&s;wer Her Maje|&s;ty
gave was to this purpo&s;e, <HI>That they &s;hould
behave them&s;elves Peaceably and Quitely, in
&s;ubmitting to the Government, and therein
they &s;hould be &s;ure of Her Royal favour and
Protection. Vide the</HI> Queen's An&s;wer, pub|li&s;h'd
in the <HI>Gazette, Janu.</HI> the, 1703.
This was a Di&s;appointment to them; but
they were &s;oon let into the Rea&s;on of it,
<HI>viz.</HI> That the Nature of the Thing admit|ted
no other An&s;were; and that Her Maje&s;ty
could not Di&s;pen&s;e with the Law. How|ever,
this did not &s;o baulk them, but that,
in &s;everal Places, they, by plain Force, en|ter'd
into vacant Churches, and kept Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
of the &s;ame, preaching, and executing
the Mini&s;terial Functions, not only, again&s;t
Law, but even without any Legal Quali|fication;
as afore&s;aid, not only not Praying
for the Queen, but not taking the Oath, or
&s;ub&s;cribing the A&s;&s;urance; and then, being
<PB N="163" REF="174">
in remote Places of the Kingdom, and under
the Protection of the <HI>Lairds</HI> and <HI>Heretors,</HI>
who were profe&s;&s;edly <HI>Jacobites,</HI> the <HI>Church</HI>
found it very difficult to remove them; and
indeed, there appear'd no vi&s;ible Way to
remove them, but the &s;ame by which they
got the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, <HI>viz.</HI> by Violence; which
was not to be done in tho&s;e Northern Parts,
without a Military Power, &s;o that many of
the&s;e Intruders keep Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;aid
Churches, and Man&s;es, and Stipends to this

<P>But &s;o great was the Re&s;olution of the&s;e

Connivance of the Queen, that it began to
be In&s;ufferable; and Complaint being made to

by Her Maje&s;ty's expre&s;s Order, publi&s;h'd
by the <HI>Privy-Council</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> to prevent

<P>Thus Matters &s;tood at the Time of the
<PB N="166" REF="177">
<HI>Union</HI> of both Kingdoms; which <HI>Union,</HI> as was

Her Maje&s;ty, and Compliment to the Church

Oppos'd, as well Privately, by their Intere&s;t,
as Publickly by the Tumults, Rabbles, and

joyn'd, upon all Occa&s;ions; as may be
&s;een at large in the Account of tho&s;e Rab|bles,

&amp;c. <HI>relating to the</HI> Union. <HI>Printed at</HI> Edin.

<P>The <HI>Union</HI> being now pa&s;s'd, in &s;pight,
as I may &s;ay, of all their Oppo&s;ition, they
continued to improve it to their Advantage;
and to that purpo&s;e, went on with their
Court to the <HI>Church of England,</HI> noted be|fore
to this End. They &s;et on Foot a No|tion
which they expected &s;omething from,
tho' afterwards they dropt it again, <HI>viz.</HI>
That the <HI>Epi&s;copal Church,</HI> as they call'd it,
<HI>of Scotland,</HI> was Incorporated into the <HI>Church
of England</HI> by the <HI>Union;</HI> but this having
no Foundation, fell, as I &s;aid, of cour&s;e. As
to their De&s;ign of propagating the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Liturgy in <HI>Scotland,</HI> it met with &s;mall En|couragement,
even their own <HI>Nonjurant</HI>
Mini&s;ters, who had &s;et up Meeting-Hou&s;es
in mo&s;t Parts of <HI>Scotland,</HI> generally rejecting
it; and tho&s;e few who &s;et it up were for|&s;aken
<PB N="167" REF="178">
by mo&s;t of their Hearers; &s;o that all
the Remedy they had, was, as before, to ob|tain
of their Friends, in the &s;everal Coun|tries,
who were in the Confederacy, to oblige
their Tenants to comply with it, which
they did with all imaginable Rigour, threat|ning,
and even puni&s;hing tho&s;e that refus'd,
&s;ome by putting them out of their Farms;
and others by Impri&s;oning tho&s;e who de|clin'd,
or refus'd it, as particularly at <HI>Fra|zer&s;burgh,</HI>
and the Parts adjacent.</P>
<P>But this was not all; the <HI>Church Judi|catories</HI>
were the next Thing which they
attack'd, and this, in defiance of Law, they
put in practice, by <HI>Riot, Rabble,</HI> and <HI>Tumult,</HI>
and becau&s;e the&s;e Things ought not to be
left on Record, without &s;ufficient Evidence,
I &s;hall confirm every thing by Law, and
proof of Fact as I go.</P>
<P><HI>And fir&s;t, as to the Law:</HI> The Elventh
Act of the Seventh Se&s;&s;ion of the Fir&s;t Par|liament
of King <HI>William, Anno</HI> 1698, enti|tuled,
<HI>Act for preventing Di&s;orders in the

made upon this very Occa&s;ion; for it had been
a Practice in that Time, and all along from
the <HI>Revolution,</HI> to Rabble the Mini&s;ters and
Pre&s;byteries, when they went about either to
&s;upply, or to plant the vacant Churches; and
this Act, for a Time, did &s;uppre&s;s the Practice.

<P>&startq;MR. <HI>Thomas Chi&s;holm,</HI> according to Ap|pointment
of the Pre&s;bytery, took Jour|ney
towards <HI>Gearloch,</HI> about Day
of <HI>February</HI> la&s;t, and that Night lodged in the
Country of <HI>Strathwren,</HI> and that upon the Mor|row,
late at Night, he came to <HI>Kinlochom,</HI> a part
of the Pari&s;h of <HI>Gearloch,</HI> belonging to Sir
<HI>John Mac-Kenzie</HI> of <HI>Coul,</HI> from which he de&s;ign'd
that Night to go, by Boat, to the other end of
the <HI>Loch,</HI> but the People of that Place under|&s;tanding
his De&s;ign, &s;top'd all the Boats, and
&s;hut all their Hou&s;es; they would neither af|ford
him Lodging, nor allow him to cro&s;s the
Water towards the Kirk, which oblig'd him to
Travel five Miles in the Night by the <HI>Lock-&s;ide,</HI>
and when he hired a Boat in order to go off,
the next Morning, to that part of the Country
where the Kirk lay; but that Night about two
in the Morning, a Party of Armed Men, about
Sixteen in Number, broke up the Door of the
Hou&s;e where he Lodg'd, drag'd his two Servants
by the Heels out of their Beds naked out of the
Hou&s;e, rai&s;ed him&s;elf out of his Bed, and compel'd
him to return with them Ten Miles, before Day|light,
the &s;ame Way from whence he came, and
then left him on a Hill, &s;everal Miles from any
Hou&s;e, without Meat or Drink; and one of his
<PB N="172" REF="183">
Servants fainted that Night, his Guard would
not allow him (tho' he had come to the Door
of a Hou&s;e where they &s;old Liquor) to take a
Dram thereof to refre&s;h him&s;elf, or revive his
Servant, but told him they did him but too
great a Complement when they &s;uffer'd him
to live, &s;o that he was nece&s;&s;itate to leave
his Servant there in that Ca&s;e, and him&s;elf,
with the other Servant, e&s;&s;ay'd to return to|ward
<HI>Gearloch</HI> another way, hiring a Guide to
lead him into <HI>Lochbroon,</HI> and from thence was
re&s;olv'd to go to <HI>Gearloch;</HI> but when he came
within Three Miles of the Country of <HI>Loch|broon</HI>
the Hills there being &s;o high, and the
Snow being &s;o deep, and being fa&s;ting watching
and travelling the whole Night before, and
that Day <HI>be fainted,</HI> where he lay Speechle&s;s
on the Snow for an Hour and a Half; his
Guide &s;eeing him in that Condition, threatned
to leave him, which he had done, had he not
been forced by his Servant to Attend: After
his reviving he travell'd &s;everal Miles, till he
came late that Night to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Ferbquare
Mac Craw,</HI> in <HI>Lochbroon,</HI> where he lodg'd all that
Night, but after Midnight, a Party of eight
or nine Men, well arm'd, broke into the Hou&s;e,
and had taken him away in&s;tantly, had not his
Landlord interpos'd for a delay till Day-light,
which when it appear'd they compell'd him
back again to <HI>Kinlochow,</HI> where, after he comes,
notwith&s;tanding all the Fatigue he had met
with that Day, they would not allow him to
go within a Hou&s;e, but kept Guard on him in
the open Fields; in the mean time a new Com|pany
all in Di&s;gui&s;e reliev'd the former Com|pany,
and brought him back again three Miles
<PB N="173" REF="184">
to a Wa&s;te-Hou&s;e in a Wood, where they kept
him till Eleven a Clock the next Day being
<HI>Saturday,</HI> but before he left that Place, being
within the Pari&s;h of <HI>Gearloch,</HI> he read the Edict
in the Hearing of tho&s;e who guarded him that
Night.&endq;</P>

<HEAD>The Men that guarded him thus, did not under&s;tand
what his Reading was, but &s;aid one to another,
Do not believe a Word he &s;ays. Thus he
did his Bu&s;ine&s;s which he went for as effectu|ally
as if they had not medled with him; for a
formal reading the Edict within the Paroch,
was all that the Law requir'd.</HEAD>
<P>&startq;The Party being reliev'd by another Party
of Fifteen Men, oblig'd him to travel that Day
thro' Hills and Waters, till he came again
within Four Miles of <HI>Lochbroon,</HI> where the
Company was divided, and Seven of them
convey'd him thro' many deep Waters, &s;ome
whereof reached very near his Arm-pits.
Upon the <HI>Saturday</HI> late they brought him to the
remote&s;t Bounds of the Pari&s;h of <HI>Contein,</HI> there
they lodg'd with him all Night, he propo&s;ed to
&s;ome of the People of that Country to preach
to them, the next Day being the Sabbath, and
the People &s;hew'd their willingne&s;s to hear him,
but he was no &s;ooner up in the Morning, than
they drag'd him away forward, and told him
that they were under command not to part
with him, till they brought him to, <HI>Fruls;</HI>
that when they came within &s;ight of <HI>Contein,</HI>
they left him, one of them at their departure
drawing him a&s;ide, &s;aid, He ought not to be

<PB N="174" REF="185">
did nothing but what they were commanded to
do by Sir <HI>John Mac-Kenzie</HI> of <HI>Coul,</HI> their Ma&s;ter,

going to <HI>Gearloch,</HI> for Sir <HI>John</HI> had guarded all

which time a new Party of <HI>Gerlach</HI>'s Tenants
(who is Minor) the Ringleaders whereof were
<HI>Murchou Mac-Virchivicecbin,</HI> alias <HI>Mac-Kenzie,
Murchou Mac-Millmoir</HI> came armed, and by Vio|lence
pre&s;&s;ed me and my Man out of that
Place the &s;aid Morning, obliging us to travel
a long Journey that Day, and left me <HI>Monday</HI>
Morning within two Miles of the abovemen|tion'd
Sir <HI>John</HI>'s Hou&s;e, and carried away my
Man, whither I could know, declaring when
they came, that they had Orders from <HI>John
Mac-Kenzie, Brother Germane</HI> to the late <HI>Gerloch,</HI>
&s;o to Treat me: All the Per&s;ons in either of
the&s;e Parties made a &s;ecret Regret to me, declar|ing
they were forc'd to this barbarous Treat|ment
by the Menaces of Sir <HI>John Mac-Kenzie</HI>
of <HI>Coul, Collin Mac Kenzie,</HI> Tutor of <HI>Gerloch,</HI>
and the afore&s;aid <HI>John Mac-Kenzie,</HI> who they
&s;aid threatned all the Paroch, if they &s;hewed
any Kindne&s;s to me, or any Pre&s;byterian Mini|&s;ter
in their Bounds, or did not to them all the
Harm in their Power: And the &s;aid Parties
bewailed, and declared the Univer&s;al Concern
of the Paroch for their De&s;olations there two
Years by pa&s;t, being thirty Miles di&s;tant from
any Mini&s;ter; to that their Children were dy|ing
without Bapti&s;m, and they oblig'd to travel
to the Hazard of their Lives for the Benefit of
Marriage; and expre&s;&s;ed their Regret, that
they were not allow'd to enjoy me, or the
Benefit of my Mini&s;try, after all their Expecta|tions
and De&s;ires after me, that it was given
<PB N="178" REF="189">
out among&s;t them, That Pre&s;bytery way a <HI>Dy|ing
Cau&s;e,</HI> and that there was encouragement
to expect their Curats re&s;tored, and therefore
they would keep their Vacancies un&s;ettled, and
laboured to keep me out, tho$ &s;ettled by the
Pre&s;hytery. Upon <HI>Monday</HI>'s Morning I u&s;ed
&s;ome Endeavours to be allow'd, to &s;ee and con|ver&s;e
with Sir <HI>John Mac-Kenzie</HI> of <HI>Coul,</HI> by
writing to him thereanent; and upon <HI>Tue&s;day</HI>
thereafter I met with him, and gave him an
Account of my Treatment among his Tenants;
I told him they declared they had his Orders
for what they did; and a&s;k'd if he would own
the &s;ame, or if he di&s;own'd it, would give me
his &s;afe Conduct to my Paroch, whereby I
might peaceably exerci&s;e my Mini&s;try among&s;t
my Flock? To which he an&s;wer'd, That he was
not oblig'd to own any &s;uch Orders, but plain|ly
own'd, that where-ever he had Power he
would hinder the Settled Mini&s;ter of <HI>Gerloch,</HI>
and how could I be &s;topp'd from Officiating
among&s;t my People con&s;idering the Civil E&s;ta|bli&s;hment
of the Goverment of this Church?
To which he an&s;wer'd, That it would be the
Queen's Forces after Application to <HI>Briti&s;h</HI>
Parliament, that would give me footing or any
Pre&s;bterian Mini&s;ter in that Place, or in any
other Paroch were he had Intere&s;t or Influence,
and that he would not own the Authority of
the Pre&s;bytery that admitted me; and thus he
behaved him&s;elf, tho' one of the Ju&s;tices of the
Peace for the County, and an Heritor in the
Paroch of <HI>Gerloch.</HI>&endq;</P>

<P>The General A&s;&s;embly met at <HI>Edinburgh,
May</HI> 10. 1711. The Marquis of <HI>Armandale</HI>
was Her Maje&s;ty's Commi&s;&s;ioner, who, making
his Speech to the A&s;&s;embly, pre&s;ented Her Ma|je&s;ty's
Letter, wherein Her Maje&s;ty a&s;&s;uring
the A&s;&s;embly of Her Favour and Protection
to the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and Her Royal
Re&s;olution to Maintain them in all their ju&s;t
Priviledges; proceeds to recommend &s;everal
Things to them, and particularly, <HI>The plan|ting
vacant Churches with Learned, Diligent,
and Pious Mini&s;ters. Note,</HI> The&s;e are the
very Words of the Queen's Letter. Little
did Her Maje&s;ty know, I dare &s;ay, or believe
what Treatment the <HI>Church</HI> had met with in
their Endeavours to plant the &s;aid Pari&s;hes
as above.</P>
<P>On the 13th the Two Papers above were
Read, by Order of the A&s;&s;embly, in the
<PB N="180" REF="191">
Hearing of the Queen's Commi&s;&s;ioner, who,
in Return, made a Speech from the Throne,
expre&s;&s;ing his <HI>great &s;urprize at the Occa&s;ion,
and his particular Di&s;&s;atisfaction at &s;uch Bar|barous
and Inhuman U&s;age, giving the A&s;|&s;embly
a&s;&s;urance, that both the Ca&s;e &s;hould be
directly, and fully laid before Her Maje&s;ty, in
order to puni&s;h the Authors thereof with the

for the Future.</HI> The&s;e were the very Words.
Nor was the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ioner wor&s;e than
his Word; and the Con&s;equence was vi&s;ible,
for Proce&s;s being order'd in the <HI>Criminal-Courts</HI> again&s;t the Per&s;ons guilty of another
Riot of the like Kind, they &s;ubmitted to the
<HI>Curch-Judicatories,</HI> and finding the promis'd
Encouragement from <HI>England</HI> fail'd them,
they humbled them&s;elves as Low as they had
before carry'd them&s;elves High and Furious,
And becau&s;e the Ca&s;e is &s;o notorious I &s;hall
end this Chapter with it, as a &s;ufficient Te&s;|timony
of the Behaviour of tho&s;e People to
the E&s;tabli&s;h'd <HI>Church;</HI> and of the Motives
which have encourag'd them to it; and above
all, a Di&s;covery of the Force put upon the
poor People, who are brought into the&s;e
Things both again&s;t Inclination and again&s;t
Con&s;cience only, not daring to Di&s;plea&s;e
their Superiors, who&s;e ab&s;olute Dominion

be put in Ca&s;e in the u&s;ual Manner to promote a Parochial

even again&s;t private Chri&s;tians who came to have the Be|nefit

peaceal$de manner, the &s;aid Per&s;ons, or one or other of them,
or one or other of the Rabble, came out and met them
with Scare-crows in their Hands, wherewith they made a
hideous Noi&s;e, and &s;cared and frighted the Hor&s;es upon
which they Rode, to the endangering of the Riders Lives.
And Mr. <HI>John Gordon</HI> having gone in privately by the
back of the Town, and the re&s;t going on in the High-Way

with a Multitude of others couveen'd together in a tumul|tuary
manner, and arm'd &s;ome with GUNS, others with
Swords, Corn-Forks, Durks, Bow-Cutts, and other offen|&s;ive

and perceiving that the People that were thus conveened
<PB N="185" REF="196">
intended to make Oppo&s;ition, the &s;aid Ju&s;tices of the Peace
requir'd the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Captain <HI>John Forbes</HI> of <HI>Boyndley,</HI>
the Bailie <HI>Stewart, James Sandilands,</HI> Son to Provo&s;t <HI>Sandi|lands,</HI>

Divine Wor&s;hip, and to countenance the Ordination; and
then coming out towards the Church-Stile, which was
fa&s;t &s;hut and baracadoed by the Rabble, they found a great
Body of the fore&s;aids Rabblers, both Men and Women,
po&s;ted without the Kirk-Stile, arm'd as above, and having
&s;everal Heaps of Stones gathered be&s;ide them; which Bo|dy
of People &s;tept a&s;ide, and gave way to the Ju&s;tices, Mi|ni&s;ter,
and others with them, until they were got in be|twixt
two Hou&s;es joining with their Corners to the two
Sides of the Kirk-Stile, and &s;o &s;oon as the Ju&s;tices, Mi|ni&s;ters,
and others were entered in betwixt the &s;aid two
Hou&s;es, the fore-mentioned Body &s;urrounded and inclo&s;ed
them; and then another great Body of the Rabble, armed
as above, which was within the Kirk-yard, (the Per&s;ons
above complained upon, making a Part of both the &s;aid
Bodies) did climb over the Church-yard Dike, and got
upon the Tops of the &s;aid two Hou&s;es, and being furni&s;h'd
with Stones of great Bigne&s;s by their Accomplices, they
threw them down with Violence upon the &s;aid Ju&s;tices,
Pre&s;bytery, and others that joined with them, while, in the
mean Time the&s;e, from the Church-yard, were throwing
Stones; and the Rabble that had &s;urrounded them behind,
were both throwing Stones and &s;tricking at them with
their Swords, Bow-Cutts, and Butts of their Guns, where|by
a great many of them were mo&s;t dangerou&s;ly hurt and
wounded, particularly the &s;aid Laid of <HI>Keithfield,</HI> Ju&s;tice of

Deans,</HI> Dean of <HI>Gild</HI> in <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> the &s;aid <HI>John Forbes,

and wounded by the &s;aid <HI>George Rob,</HI> or one or other of the
Per&s;ons complain'd upon, or one or other of the fore|&s;aid
Rabble. The &s;aids Ju&s;tices of Peace, Mini&s;ters,
and others with them, finding them&s;elves thus inclos'd,
and all like to be kill'd, they were oblig'd to force their
Way back again through the Rabble that &s;urrounded them
behind; a Part of which Rabble did pur&s;ue them to <HI>John
Riccart's</HI> Clo&s;s, &s;ome throwing Stones over the Hou&s;es
upon them, and others firing Guns after them with &s;uch
Fury, that the Colfing, or Forrage, fired the Thatch of <HI>Ric|cart's</HI>
Hou&s;e; and thereafter the &s;aid Rabble went into
the &s;aid <HI>John Riccart</HI>'s Hou&s;e, where the Pre&s;bytery's
Dinner was provided, and fir&s;t enquir'd if any of the Mi|ni&s;ters
were there, and threatned, that if any of them, or
the&s;e that had joined with them, were found concealed
in the Hou&s;e, they would &s;et Fire to both Ends of it;
and then they &s;eized and did eat up the Victuals, and carried
a Part of the Liquors out to the Mercat-Cro&s;s and drunk
it, having a Bag-pips all the while playing to them, and
then went out to meet Mr. <HI>Keith,</HI> the Intruder, who was
coming in to <HI>Kirktoun.</HI> The Pre&s;bytery being thus hotly
handled, and perceiving that they could not get the Ordi|nation
performed without the inevitable Hazard of their
Lives, they were nece&s;&s;itate to go Home without fini&s;hing
the &s;ame. As the manner of acting in this Rabble was
mo&s;t unaccountable, &s;o the &s;ame did not happen by meer
Accident, but was contrived aforehand, and the Mea&s;ures
laid down by the &s;aids <HI>William Baird</HI> of <HI>Auchmedden, James
Keith,</HI> of <HI>Creiche,</HI> or one or other of them: In &s;o far as,
1<HI>mo.</HI> They or &s;ome of them kept a Meeting at <HI>Old Deer,</HI>
about the 9th or 10th of <HI>March</HI> la&s;t, or one or other of the
Days of the &s;aid Month, wherein they concerted the fore|&s;aid
Opposition. 2<HI>do.</HI> They contrived and cau&s;ed publi&s;h
Thro' the Paroch a fal&s;e and &s;editious Paper, wherein they
<PB N="187" REF="198">
libel and rail again&s;t the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Government, Order
and Wor&s;hip of this Church, on purpo&s;e to excite the
People again&s;t the Pre&s;bytery, and pretending that they
could not in Con&s;cience joyn therewith. They declare
their intended Oppo&s;ition to the Settlement of the Paroch
with a Pre&s;byterian Mini&s;ter; and they contrived and
drew up another Paper, which they cau&s;ed read in the
Church, upon the Lord's Day, immediately before the &s;aid
Rabble, Warning and Enjoining the Parochioners to meet
together at the Day appointed for ths Ordination, in or|der
to oppo&s;e the &s;ame. 3^<HI>t^i^o.</HI> They ordered &s;everal Per|&s;ons,

to &s;tir up the People there conveen'd for the &s;ame Purpo&s;e;
and the &s;aid Gentlemen, or one or other of them, did en|courage
the Rabble, by promi&s;ing to free them of all Char|ges
and Expences, and to protect them from any Puni&s;h|ment
that &s;hould be inflicted on them, upon account of
their Acce&s;&s;ion to the &s;aid Tumult. And albeit the &s;aid

when &s;itting in his own Baron Court, by <HI>Anna Greden,</HI>
Spou&s;e to <HI>John Turner,</HI> Clerk, in <HI>Old D$er,</HI> repre&s;enting,
That her Hou&s;e was mole&s;ted and damnified by &s;ome of his
Men or Tenents, who threatned her for harbouring of Mr.
<HI>John Gordon,</HI> and entreating the &s;aid Rabble might be Di&s;|courag'd;
yet he not only refu&s;ed to grant her Reque&s;t,
but mocked and ridiculed her, even in the Court-place,
and before a great many of the Per&s;ons guilty, who were
there pre&s;ent: Yea, there were of his own Dome&s;tick Ser|vants
pre&s;ent at the &s;aid Rabble, and very active therein:
And the &s;aid <HI>Silve&s;ter Daugla&s;s, George Rankin,</HI> and <HI>Charles
Mori&s;on,</HI> gave Orders to &s;ome of the &s;aid Rabble, That they
&s;hould &s;tand their Ground again&s;t all the Per&s;ons that

<P>&startq;And the &s;aid <HI>Charles Mori&s;on</HI> came armed to <HI>Old Deer</HI>
the &s;ame Day that the Rabble happen'd; and tho' he was
de&s;ir'd by the Ju&s;tices of Peace to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in making
Patent Doors, yet he did it not: And the &s;aid <HI>John Forbes</HI>
not only came there armed the &s;ame Day, but brought
with him &s;everal of the People of <HI>Pitfour</HI>'s Ground, and
even of his own Dome&s;tick Servants, and order'd them
to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the Rabble; And the &s;aids <HI>Creichie, Bruxie</HI>
and <HI>Auchrenny</HI> did give out, that by a late Act of the
<HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament PATRONAGES were re&s;tored, and
<PB N="188" REF="199">
prote&s;ted for the Benefit of that Act, and that the Pre&s;|bytery
&s;hould not pre&s;ume to go on in their Intention of
planting their Church, and threatned them, that if they
went on with it, they might expect to be rabbled: And
this they al&s;o expre&s;t in the Rea&s;ons of Appeal given in
to the Pre&s;bytery by them, for them&s;elves, and in name of
&s;ome others of the <HI>Heritors,</HI> or at lea&s;t by <HI>William Bow|man,</HI>

Ca&s;e being decided in his Favour by the Hou&s;e of Peers,
they might, if they oppo&s;ed Mr. <HI>Gordon,</HI> quickly expect an

Thus boa&s;ting and abu&s;ing the Name of Authority in&s;o|lently

loaded with Goods, Wares, Furniture or Provi&s;ion, of a

coming towards the <HI>Kirktoun</HI> of <HI>Old Deer,</HI> and did violently
&s;eize the &s;ame; and having abu&s;ed and maltreated the

to &s;end back; And for doing this they pretended the

<P>_THE Attempt of &s;etting up
the <HI>Common-Prayer</HI> in <HI>Edin.</HI>
had not made &s;uch a Noi&s;e,
as it did at this time, if the
Manner of doing it had not
&s;atisfy'd the People there,
that it was not the &s;aying the <HI>Common-Prayer,</HI>
or reading the <HI>Liturgy,</HI> which was the De|&s;ign,
but the affronting the Magi&s;trates; fly|ing
in the Face of the Laws, and in&s;ulting the

Government, as well Eccle&s;ia&s;tick as Civil;
for the <HI>Liturgy</HI> was read in Two &s;everal

the Mini&s;ters reading it met with no Di&s;tur|bance
at all; but this not &s;atisfying, it was
manag'd now in &s;uch a Manner, as that the
Magi&s;trates mu&s;t take Cognizance of it, or
no longer pretend to the Legal Power of
Magi&s;trates in that City.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Step taken in this Affair, was to
cau&s;e a Rumour to be &s;pread Abroad, That
Her Maje&s;ty had given the <HI>Old-Kirk</HI> at <HI>Haly-Rood-Hou&s;e,</HI>
being the <HI>Chappel-Royal</HI> belong|ing
to the Queen's Palace, to the <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI>

Occa&s;ionally be there, to have the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Service read therein, and to have the Mi|ni&s;ter
preach in a Gown, and read Prayers
in a Surplice, as in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Account of this gave no great Un|ea&s;ine&s;s,
becau&s;e the People had quickly an
A&s;&s;urance, even from the Queen Her&s;elf,
that no <HI>Innovation</HI> &s;hould be encourag'd,
and that no &s;uch Grant was, or &s;hould be,
obtain'd for the &s;aid Chappel.</P>
<P>But a Plot being ripe, a Tool was not
long wanting; one <HI>Green&s;hields,</HI> a poor and
contemptible Fellow, a <HI>Scots</HI> Man by Birth,
but lately come from <HI>Ireland,</HI> was found, or,
<PB N="195" REF="206">
as &s;ome &s;ay, brought over as a fit In&s;trument
for this Work. The Character of this Fel|low
is very brief: He was the Son of a Be|dell,

in <HI>Lithgo;</HI> his Reputation, as to publick
Scandal, was charg'd with open Drunken|ne&s;s,
lewd Behaviour, Singing Bea&s;tly Songs,
and the like; his A&s;&s;urance was unque&s;ti|on'd;
he had taken the Oaths to the Queen;
was very meanly Taught; had little Cler|gy;
mean Parts; and was a mo&s;t wretched
Preacher: But all the&s;e Defects were &s;up|ply'd
in Face, and he never wanted to put
him&s;elf up at a good Price.</P>
<P>This In&s;trument being obtain'd, the next
Thing was to put it into a Method; for
this Rea&s;on, and to put the &s;ame Face on it
that was pretended before, the Thing was
propos'd to &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men in the Office of
the <HI>Cu&s;toms,</HI> and <HI>Exchequer,</HI> who willingly
(tho' weakly) came into the Snare, and agreed

and having taken a Hou&s;e in the mo&s;t pub|lick
Part of the City, he open'd his Meeting
ju&s;t at the Cro&s;s of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> which is the
Parade or Exchange of all the People of any
Bu&s;ine&s;s or Fa&s;hion, and e&s;pecially where,
on every <HI>Sabbath,</HI> the Magi&s;trates go in
their Formalities to the Great Church.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="207">
Two Things in this Attempt alarm'd the
People; 1. Its being done &s;o in the Face of
the Government, and in Contempt of the
Magi&s;trates, or, indeed, of the Laws: And,
2. That it was pretended to be own'd by
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men, who being newly United,
and having Places and Sallaries there from
the State, were, as it may be &s;aid, Eating the
Nation's Bread; and in whom, therefore, the
In&s;olence was very Affronting; and the more
in, that it was at a Time when Her Maje&s;ty
was Daily A&s;&s;uring the People She would
never encourage any <HI>Inva&s;ion</HI> of their Pri|vileges,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the&s;e Con&s;iderations the Mobb were
very hardly re&s;train'd from Falling upon them
with Violence, and the following Step was
rather encourag'd to put a Stop to, and pre|vent
the common People's Fury, than from
any other Rea&s;on. The Commi&s;&s;ion of the
General A&s;&s;embly happen'd to be Sitting ju&s;t
at that Time, to whom the Citizens of
<HI>Edinburgh</HI> apply'd, in a Petition to them, to
take Cognizance of this Attempt, as an <HI>In|vation</HI>
in their Wor&s;hip, and an <HI>In|nova&s;ion</HI>
on the Privileges of the <HI>Church of Scotland,</HI>
and that they would immediately &s;ilence
and put a Stop to the &s;ame; &s;uch was the
Zeal of the Inhabitants, that, in le&s;s than
Two Hours, they got &s;everal Hundred
Hands to this Petition.</P>
<P>Pur&s;uant to this Petition, the Commi&s;&s;ion
<PB N="197" REF="208">
referr'd the Matter to the <HI>Pre&s;bytry, as you
will &s;ee at large afterward;</HI> and accordingly
the <HI>Pre&s;bytry</HI> cited him before them, where
he appear'd, but with great Haughtine&s;s, di&s;|owning
their Authority, and refu&s;ing to give
any Account of him&s;elf. The Hi&s;tory of his
Behaviour, and their Treating him there
is publick, already, in many particular
Tracts, and needs not to take up any Room
in this Tract: Only, that future Ages may
have a right Notion of that Affair, it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to ob&s;erve &s;ome few of the mo&s;t ma|terial
Pa&s;&s;ages that relate to it, more parti|cularly,
that the <HI>Pre&s;bytry</HI> enquir'd nothing
of, nor pa&s;s'd any Cen&s;ure about his Setting
up a New Wor&s;hip in <HI>Scotland,</HI> viz. Reading
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liturgy, or Common-Prayer,
nor of his Pinciples, as being <HI>Epi&s;copal,</HI> but
a&s;k'd him, particularly, <HI>By what Authority
he exercis'd the Office of a Mini&s;ter in that
Place?</HI> He refus'd to an&s;wer for &s;ome Time,
but at length told them, <HI>He was an Ordain'd
Mini&s;ter.</HI> They a&s;k'd him, <HI>What Mini&s;ter?</HI>
He an&s;wer'd, <HI>A Mini&s;ter of the Church of</HI>
England. Being requir'd to produce his Let|ters
of <HI>Ordination,</HI> he declin'd that al&s;o for
&s;ome Time, but, at la&s;t, produc'd Orders grant|ed
by a <HI>Scots</HI> Depos'd, Exauctorate Bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>Upon this, the <HI>Moderator</HI> of the <HI>Pre&s;bytry,</HI>
or one of the Members, a&s;k'd him how he
could have the Face to &s;ay to them before,
<HI>That he was a Mini&s;ter of the Church of</HI> Eng|land?
<PB N="198" REF="209">
To which he gave this ab&s;urd Reply,
viz. <HI>That the Church of</HI> England, <HI>and the
Epi&s;copal Church of</HI> Scotland <HI>were Encorpo|rated
by the Union.</HI> But the Emptine&s;s of
this Shift being &s;oon Expos'd, and he Obli|ged
not to In&s;i&s;t upon it, he was told, his
Orders were in&s;ufficient; and the &s;aid Bi|&s;hop's
being totally Deprived by the Laws
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> Exauctorate and Di&s;abled, they
had no more power to Authorize any Man
to Preach, or admit any Man into Orders,
in the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and therefore,
tho' he might e&s;teem him&s;elf a Mini&s;ter on
that account, they could not allow him to
be &s;uch; nor had he any Legal Authority
to Exerci&s;e the Office of a Mini&s;ter, within
the Bounds of that Church. What Law
they grounded this upon, and that it was
really agreeable to an expre&s;s Act of Par|liament,
we &s;hall &s;ee by and by in the De|fence
made to it by the Magi&s;trates of <HI>Edinb.</HI></P>
<P>He in&s;i&s;ted upon his Orders; and Di&s;|owning
their Authority, went out of the
Court abruptly, refu&s;ing to An&s;wer to any
Thing they &s;hould Object. Whereupon the
<HI>Pre&s;bytry,</HI> Thinking it their Duty to main|tain
the <HI>Legal Authority</HI> of a Church Judi|catory,
which they were fully ve&s;ted with
by the Laws of the Land, thought fit to pa&s;s
their Sentence, which they drew up in Form,
and he refu&s;ing to obey their Summons, or ap|pear
when cited, they caus'd their &s;aid Sen|tence
<PB N="199" REF="210">

<P>I noted before, that the Commi&s;&s;ion of the

ob&s;erv'd, That they enter'd the more will|ingly
into this Examination, to prevent the

fore&s;aw would be the Event, the People be|ing
enraged, to the la&s;t Degree, at the In&s;o|lence

I noted, it was at the Reque&s;t, and upon the

very proper to give at large, and is as follows:</P>

<P>&startq;Yet, to our very great Surprize, &s;everal

this City, after the <HI>Scots</HI> Epi&s;copal Way,
but al&s;o in &s;everal Places here have &s;et up

&s;candalous and immoral in their Lives

pretend to be qualify'd according to Law,
<PB N="201" REF="212">

no le&s;s than the Ruin of both <HI>Church</HI> and

&s;hewing, that where;</P>
<P>At <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> the 7th Day of <HI>Sept.</HI> One thou&s;and
&s;even hundred and nine Years; the <HI>Pre&s;bytery</HI> of
<HI>Edinburgh</HI> having con&s;ider'd a Reference from the
Se&s;&s;ion of the College Kirk, concerning Mr. <HI>James
Green&s;hields;</HI> did, thereupon, cite the &s;aid Mr. <HI>Green|&s;hields</HI>
before them, and he compearing, produced
an Act of Ordination by the Exauctorated Bi&s;hop
<PB N="210" REF="221">
of <HI>Ro&s;s;</HI> dated <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> One thou&s;and &s;ix hundred
and ninety four Years; bearing, that he was or|dain'd
a <HI>Pre&s;byter</HI> according to the Rites and U&s;a|ges
of the Church of <HI>Scotland;</HI> together with Te&s;ti|monials
from <HI>Ireland;</HI> was interrogate by what
Authority he did preach, and exerci&s;e any Part of
the Mini&s;try within the Bounds of this <HI>Pre&s;bytery,</HI>
without Call or Warrand from this <HI>Pre&s;bytery</HI> con|form
to Law; he did decline the Authority of this
<HI>Pre&s;bytery</HI> and <HI>Church,</HI> and &s;ub&s;crib'd the &s;ame, <HI>coram.</HI>
The Tenour whereof follows; <HI>Whereas, being or|dain'd
a Mini&s;ter of the Church of</HI> England, <HI>and has
been of that Communion ever &s;ince, and now am and
having Occa&s;ion to come and to re&s;ide in my own Coun|try;
where, for my Benefit, and the Benefit of tho&s;e who
were in the &s;ame Circum&s;tances with my&s;elf, I do, in a
private Hou&s;e, keep Divine Wor&s;hip, according to the
Liturgy of the Church of</HI> England, <HI>and &s;ince by the
Union of the two Kingdoms, I do believe that the Epi&s;|copal
Church of</HI> Scotland is now incorporate with the
Church of <HI>England,</HI> and that though Pre&s;bytety is the
legal E&s;tabli&s;hment of <HI>North-Britain,</HI> yet I find there
is no Law again&s;t tho&s;e of the Communion of the Church
of <HI>England,</HI> to exerci&s;e their Wor&s;hip in a private Man|er,
without intruding into any Church or Glebe of any
Mini&s;ter e&s;tabli&s;h'd by Law; and, therefore, I do not
think my&s;elf &s;ubject, or liable to any Cen&s;ure of any Eccle|&s;ia&s;tical
Judicatory in <HI>North-Britain,</HI> but only in &s;o far
as to give an Account that I am lawfully ordain'd Mi|ni&s;ter,
and free of any Scandal that may incapacitate me
for &s;uch an Undertaking. And whereupon I take in&s;tru|ments.
Sic $ubbitur James Green&s;hields. Which be|ing
read, he was remov'd, and being call'd in again,
and the Moderator having told him that he had
declin'd the Authority of this Church. To which
he reply'd, That this Church had no Juri&s;diction
<PB N="211" REF="222">
over him, as to Spiritual Concerns, and adher'd to
his former Declinature. All which, the <HI>Pre&s;bytery</HI>
con&s;idering, do find, That the &s;aid Mr. <HI>Green&s;hields</HI>
has, in high Contempt of this Church E&s;tabli&s;h|ment
by Law, declined their Authority; that he
has exercis'd the Mini&s;try within the Bounds of
this <HI>Pre&s;bytery,</HI> without their Allowance, which is
an unwarrantable Intru&s;ion; and introduc'd a Form
of Wor&s;hip contrary to the Purity and Uniformi|ty
of the Wor&s;hip of this Church e&s;tabli&s;h'd by
Law. Wherefore, the <HI>Pre&s;bytery</HI> did, and hereby
do, unanimou&s;ly, prohibit and di&s;charge the &s;aid
Mr. <HI>Green&s;hields</HI> to exerci&s;e any Part of the Office
of the Holy Mini&s;try within their Bounds, and
recommends to the Magi&s;trates of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and
other Judges competent, to render this Sentence
effectual, declaring always, that the <HI>Pre&s;bytery</HI> re|&s;erves
to them&s;elves the farther Con&s;ideration of
the whole Affair. Extracted by me,</P>

eighth Day of <HI>September</HI> In&s;tant, read in Pre&s;ence

apprehended, and compearing Per&s;onally before

Day, being the tenth In&s;tant; and de&s;iring he might
then attend in the new Council-Chamber, by Ten

of the Clock in the Forenoon; and accordingly,
the &s;aid Magi&s;trates having then met, they, upon
the &s;aid Mr. <HI>James Green&s;hields</HI> his Compearance,
caus'd read to him the &s;aid Act and Remit of the
&s;aid <HI>Pre&s;bytery;</HI> and after reading thereof, enquir'd

he an&s;wer'd, That he could not comply with, or
would he obtemper the &s;aid Sentence pronounc'd
by the &s;aid <HI>Pre&s;bytery.</HI> Wherefore, the Magi&s;trates
as Ju&s;tices fore&s;aid, in per&s;uance of the fore&s;aid
Sentence of the &s;aid Reverend <HI>Pre&s;bytery,</HI> and Re|mit

Function, within the City of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> Liberties

Application made by the Neighbourhood, to

<P>It would be too long to de&s;cant here upon
the loud Clamour rais'd over <HI>England,</HI> of
the Per&s;ecution of this Reverend Man, as
they call'd him, tho' the Man him&s;elf, more
eminent for Singing Bawdy Songs, and for
other Immoralities, than any Reverend Be|haviour
as a <HI>Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel,</HI> was a
Per&s;on they ought to have been a&s;ham'd of;
but it &s;erv'd the De&s;ign &s;o well, that the
Man, being acted by a private Party in <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
and &s;upported from thence by large
Supplies, lay long in the <HI>Tolbooth,</HI> till their
Affairs ripen'd, in <HI>England,</HI> to a Head, and
till a Party came in that might bring all
their De&s;igns to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>When the&s;e Things, I &s;ay, began to ri|pen,
they proceeded, and the fir&s;t Thing he
did, was to appeal from the Sentence of the
Magi&s;trates of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> to the Lords of
the Se&s;&s;ion in <HI>Scotland,</HI> which was done by
a <HI>Bill of Su&s;pen&s;ion,</HI> as it is call'd there; and
becau&s;e, in this <HI>Bill of Su&s;pen&s;ion,</HI> and the

I could not give the Reader a better State

Appeal is as follows:</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Bill of Su&s;pen&s;ion for Mr. James Green&s;hields.</HEAD>
<P>MY Lords of Council and Se&s;&s;ion, unto your
Lord&s;hips, humbly means and &s;hews, your
Servitor Mr. <HI>James Green&s;hields,</HI> late Mini&s;ter at
the Church of <HI>Tynan,</HI> in <HI>Ireland;</HI> that where I
being cited before the <HI>Pre&s;bytery</HI> of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> for
alledged Exerci&s;ing the Holy Mini&s;try, without
the Allowance of any Church Judicatory, and
bringing in Rites and Ceremonies, contrary to the
Purity and Uniformity of the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the &s;aid <HI>Pre&s;bytery</HI> did prohibit me to
exerci&s;e any part of the Holy Mini&s;try within
their Bounds; and did, thereafter, apply to the
Magi&s;trates of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> to render their Sen|tence
effectual: Who upon the Tenth Day of <HI>Sep|tember</HI>
la&s;t by pa&s;t, did interpo&s;e their Authority
to the Sentence of the <HI>Pre&s;bytery,</HI> and did expre&s;ly
prohibit me to exerci&s;e any Part of the Holy Mi|ni&s;try
within the Bounds and Liberties of the
good Town of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> with Certification, that
it I tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed in any part of the Premi&s;es, I
&s;hould be Impri&s;oned in the <HI>Tolbooth</HI> of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI>
and &s;uffer &s;uch other Puni&s;hments as they &s;hould
think fit to inflict upon me: And, for alledged
contravening of their &s;aid Sentence, by preaching
<PB N="215" REF="226">
and performing Divine Service, publickly, upon the
<HI>Sabbath-Day</HI> thereafter, having cau&s;ed actually
incarcerate me within their, <HI>Tolbooth,</HI> therein to
remain ay, and while I find caution to de&s;i&s;t
from the Exerci&s;e of my Mini&s;try, within the
City of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> and Suburbs thereof, in time
coming: Mo&s;t wrongou&s;ly and unju&s;tly con&s;ider|ing
it is of Verity, that I being legally Ordain'd
a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel, did for &s;ome time, &s;erve
the Cure at the &s;aid Church of <HI>Tynan,</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI>
under one of the Prebendaries of <HI>Armagh,</HI> and
was duly qualified, both to the late King <HI>William,</HI>
and to Her pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty; and am known to be
well Affected to the pre&s;ent Government, as will
appear from ample Te&s;tificates of my Qualifi|tions
and good Behaviour, from the Arch-Bi&s;hop
of <HI>Armagh,</HI> and the Clergy of that Dioce&s;e: And
having occa&s;ion to come over here, about my
nece&s;&s;ary Affairs, before I was ready to return
the &s;aid Prebendary, under whom I had the
Cure at the Church of <HI>Tynan,</HI> happen'd to die,
and I thereby render'd dete&s;titute of a Charge;
and being, at the &s;ame time, earne&s;tly invited,
and de&s;ired by &s;everal Per&s;ons here, who are of
the Communion of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> their
Native Country, and who did not join with the
pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church here; (&s;o that no E&s;ta|bli&s;h'd
Mini&s;ter's Charge was encroach'd upon:)
And having Council and Advice, that there was
no Law to the Contrary, was &s;o prevail'd upon to
preach, and read Prayers to the&s;e Per&s;ons, after
the Form of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> And I en|gaged
in this the more readily, when I con&s;ider'd,
that the <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> Di&s;&s;enting Mini&s;ters in <HI>Ire|land,</HI>
(where they have no Toleration from
the Government, as in <HI>England</HI>) and who are for
<PB N="216" REF="227">
the mo&s;t part, <HI>Scots-men,</HI> if they be qualified ac|cording
to Law, and preach, and live as becomes,
are never di&s;turbed by the regular Clergy; but
they enjoy the free Exerci&s;e of Religion, after
their own Way, almo&s;t in every Pari&s;h: And I
did expect that their Brethren in <HI>Scotland</HI> would
not do to others, what they would not have others
do to them. Having thus laid before your Lord|&s;hips
the Matter of Fact, and Circum&s;tances there|of,
it is evident, that the Procedure and Sentences
both of the <HI>Pre&s;bytery</HI> and good Town of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI>
have no Ground nor Foundation in Law, and &s;o
are mo&s;t unwarrantable; for the Rea&s;ons follow|ing.
<HI>Primo,</HI> I being legally ordained a Mini&s;ter,
and duly qualified as &s;uch, am under the Pro|tection
and Favour of the Government, by &s;everal
Laws and Acts of Parliament; and particularly,
by the Sixteenth Act of the Meeting of the States
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> holden in <HI>Anno</HI> One thou&s;and &s;ix
hundred and ninety nine Years, whereby it is
prohibited and di&s;charged, that no Injury be offe|red
by any Per&s;on who&s;oever, to any Mini&s;ter of
the Go&s;pel, either of Church or Meeting-Hou&s;e, in
the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and Exerci&s;e of the Mini&s;try there|in,
they behaving them&s;elves as becomes under the
pre&s;ent Government. And therefore, the fore&s;aid
Sentence of Impri&s;onment and Execution thereof,
is manife&s;tly illegal and without Warrand; E&s;pe|cially
con&s;idering, <HI>Secundo,</HI> That the only Rea&s;on
a&s;&s;igned for the Sentence, is, that I did judicially
acknowledge, that I preached and performed Di|vine
Service, publickly, upon a Sabbath-Day, after
I was di&s;charged therefrom by the <HI>Pre&s;bytery</HI> of
the Bounds, and in contempt al&s;o of the Magi|&s;trates
Sentence, interpo&s;ing their Authority to the
<HI>Pre&s;bytery</HI>'s afore&s;aid prohibition; with and under
<PB N="217" REF="228">
the Certification, not only of Impri&s;onment, but
of &s;uch other Puni&s;hment as they &s;hould think
fit to inflict; which Rea&s;on can never be &s;u&s;tained
to &s;upport the fore&s;aid Sentence in Law, there
being none that authorizes, or gives Warrand to
any <HI>Pre&s;bytery,</HI> or other Church Judicature, to pro|hibit
and di&s;charge any Mini&s;ter from Preaching,
or having publick Prayers in his own Family, or
other private Hou&s;e, which is all that I do; un|le&s;s
it could be qualified, that the Doctrine preach|ed
by me was Erroneous, or that my Prayers con|tained
any thing not warranted from the Word
of God, and Rule of our Faith, which, in the pre|&s;ent
Ca&s;e, was not &s;o much as alledged, or that
any thing was &s;aid or &s;poke by me, in my &s;aid
Religious Performance, &s;hewing any Di&s;loyalty to
the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hed Government. And as no
Church Judicature had any Authority from Law,
to i&s;&s;ue out &s;uch a Prohibition, much le&s;s are the
Magi&s;trates of the Good Town authoriz'd to give
their Authority thereto, and that by pronouncing
a Sentence of Impri&s;onment, and other Puni&s;h|ments
again&s;t the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors. For albeit Ma|gi&s;trates,
Judges and other Officers of Ju&s;tice, are
by Law required to give all due A&s;&s;i&s;tance, for
making the Sentences and Cen&s;ures of the Church
and Judicatories thereof, to be obey'd, yet that can
be only under&s;tood of Church Cen&s;ures, with re&s;pect
to the Corruption of Life or Doctrine, or of &s;uch
Sentences within their Spheres, and Juri&s;diction,
which can never be extended to the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e,
or beyond Mini&s;ters and Preachers within the
Churches Communion, whereof the Su&s;pender is
not. And that the Church's Juri&s;diction is thus
re&s;tricted over Mini&s;ters and Preachers, admitted
and continued within their Communion, does evi-dently
<PB N="218" REF="229">
appear from the 23<HI>d Act,</HI> of the Parliament holden
in <HI>Anno</HI> 1693. Yea farther, &s;o careful are our Laws
of giving their Protection to all Mini&s;ters and
Preachers of the Go&s;pel that are qualified to the
Civil Government, that albeit they do not &s;ub|&s;cribe
the <HI>Conf&s;&s;ion of Faith,</HI> own and acknowledge
the pre&s;ent Government of this Church, not to ob|&s;erve
the &s;ame <HI>Uniformity</HI> of Wor&s;hip, that the pre|&s;ent
Government does enjoin and practi&s;e, as is re|quired
by the fore&s;aid 23<HI>d Act,</HI> which concerns
only Mini&s;ters in Churches, and tho&s;e of the
Churches Communion, as &s;aid is; yet the &s;amin
is di&s;pen&s;ed with, and the Law in &s;o far derogate
from, by po&s;terior Laws, and particularly by the
27<HI>th Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> holden in <HI>Anno</HI> 1694.
whereby 'tis provided and declared, That all Mi|ni&s;ters
who &s;hall duly qualify them&s;elves, by Ta|king
the Oath of <HI>Allegiance,</HI> and &s;ub&s;cribing the
<HI>A&s;&s;urance,</HI> without Impo&s;ing upon them the other
Qualifications mention'd in the &s;aid 23d <HI>Act</HI> of
the Parliament, 1693, with re&s;pect to the Church
Government, and Form of Wor&s;hip, &s;hall have
the Government's Protection, as to their Kirks,
Benefices and Stipends. Which Act, in Favours
of the &s;aid Mini&s;ters, is ratified by the <HI>Act</HI> 2d, of
the Parliament 1700. <HI>Act 3d</HI> Parliament 1702,
and <HI>Act 2d</HI> Parliament 1703. And if the Law
does thus di&s;pen&s;e with the want of <HI>Unifor|mity</HI>
of Wor&s;hip in Favours of Mini&s;ters in the
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Churches, and protects them in
their Rights and Benefices, notwith&s;tanding of
the fore&s;aid <HI>23d Act</HI> in <HI>Anno</HI> 1693, which may
be &s;aid to comprehend them; then much le&s;s can
the &s;aid <HI>Act,</HI> with re&s;pect to what it requires, as to
the <HI>Uniformity</HI> of Wor&s;hip, and Owning of the
<HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> Government, be extended to Preachers
<PB N="219" REF="230">
that are qualified to the Government, who Preach
and Pray only in private Hou&s;es, tho' in a differ|ent
Form and Manner from that of the <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI>
Church, &s;ince the Form and Manner of Wor&s;hip
ob&s;erv'd by the Su&s;pender is not Reprobat, or di&s;|charged
by any Law. And my Ca&s;e can never be
&s;aid to be comprehended by the fore&s;aid 23d <HI>Act,</HI>
I neither being received in the Communion of this
Church, nor in the Enjoyment of any Benefice.
<HI>Tertio,</HI> As it thus appears, that the above Proce|dure
again&s;t me, has no Foundation or Warrand
from the Acts of Parliament; &s;o it cannot po&s;&s;ibly
be warranted from any pretended <HI>Act</HI> of the <HI>Com|mi&s;&s;ion</HI>
of the <HI>General A&s;&s;embly,</HI> who has no Legal
Power to Form or Make any <HI>Acts,</HI> with re&s;pect to
tho&s;e without their Communion, who have their
freedom to choi&s;e what Form or Manner of Di|vine
Wor&s;hip they think mo&s;t agreeable, provi|ding
the &s;ame be not di&s;charged by the Civil Au|thority.
<HI>Quarto,</HI> The re&s;training of Mens Liber|ties
without a legal Ground, is &s;uch a horrid In|ju&s;tice
to Nature, (Liberty and Freedom being the
mo&s;t valuable Intere&s;ts of Mankind) that the Laws
of all Nations and human Societies do anxiou&s;ly
provide for the Security of Liberty, by inflicting
of &s;evere Puni&s;hments upon the Unju&s;t Re&s;trainers
thereof. And herein our own Laws are not de|fective,
as appears from the <HI>6th Act</HI> of the Parlia|ment
1701, by which mo&s;t excellent Law, full
Provi&s;ion is made, for &s;ecuring of the Liberties of
the Subject, and again&s;t their <HI>Wrongous Impri&s;on|ment.</HI>
And &s;ince my Impri&s;onment (which has
continu'd for near two Months, to the great Pre|judice
of my Health, as well as of the Means of
Sub&s;i&s;tence of my &s;elf, and numerous Family) pro|ceeds
upon a Sentence, without the lea&s;t Warrand,
<PB N="220" REF="231">
or any Shadow of Law, as appears From the Pre|mi&s;&s;es;
Therefore the fore&s;aid s Prohibitions and
Sentences again&s;t me, ought to be <HI>Simpliciter</HI> Su|&s;pended
by your Lord&s;hips, and I Ordain'd to be
&s;et at Liberty, and that without finding of Cau|tion,
as the Warrand for my Impri&s;onment requires.
<HI>HEREFORE, I be&s;eech your Lard&s;hips, for your War|rand
and Deliverance, for Letters of</HI> Su&s;pen&s;ion <HI>and</HI>
Liberation, <HI>in the Premi&s;&s;es,</HI> in Communi Forma;
According to Ju&s;tice and your Lord&s;hips An&s;wer.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Green&s;hields</HI> having no farther In|&s;tructions

ANSWERS for the Magi&s;trates of the Good
Town of Edinburgh, to the Bill of Su&s;|pen&s;ion,
given in the Name of Mr. James
Green&s;hields, pretended late Mini&s;ter of
the Church of Tynan in Ireland.</HEAD>
<P>THE Complainer, Mr. <HI>James Green&s;hields,</HI> with|out
a Legal Vocation to be a lawful Mini&s;ter
of any Church or Communion, having pre&s;ump|tuou&s;ly
taken upon him to preach and exerci&s;e all
the Parts of the Mini&s;terial Function in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
and that at <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> and with an uncommon
O&s;tentation to practi&s;e what he had begun openly.</P>
<P>The Reverend <HI>Pre&s;bytery</HI> of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> did, very
&s;uitable to their Duty, call him before them; And
he did &s;o far acknowledge their ju&s;t Authority as
to Compear, and did produce a pretended Act of
Ordination, bearing Date in <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1694, by the
late Bi&s;hop of <HI>Ro&s;s,</HI> long after Prelacy, and all
<PB N="222" REF="233">
Superiority in Offices in this Kingdom above <HI>Pre&s;|byters,</HI>
had been aboli&s;h'd by King and Parliament,
in the $d Act of Parliament held in the Year 1689.</P>
<P>Tho' this pretended Ordination &s;o manife&s;tly
Defective; The &s;aid Mr. <HI>Green&s;hields</HI> pretended to
ju&s;tifie, and carry'd him&s;elf &s;o haughtily, as to
decline the Authority of the Church, which he had
the Minute before acknowledg'd, and then, with an
Ignorance equal to his Pre&s;umption, pretended to
be a <HI>Pre&s;byter</HI> of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> tho' his
Ordination was by an <HI>Exauctorate</HI> or no Bi&s;hop of
<HI>Scotland;</HI> and to &s;upport this, alledg'd an imagi|nary
Incorporation of the Churches of <HI>Scotland</HI> and
<HI>England,</HI> and to compleat his Incon&s;i&s;tencies and
Follies, did endeavour to ju&s;tifie this Incorpora|tion
by the Act of Union, tho' it has mo&s;t care|fully
pre&s;erv'd the E&s;tabli&s;h'd <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> Church-Government in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and di&s;tingui&s;h'd the Ca&s;e
of the Church here, from that in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>It cannot &s;eem &s;trange, that the Reverend <HI>Pre&s;|bytery</HI>
did di&s;charge the Complainer in the&s;e Cir|cum&s;tances
to preach, &s;eeing he had not &s;o much
as the Pretence of Authority, and was in Effect a
<HI>Layman,</HI> a&s;&s;uming to him&s;elf Orders in a Place
where there is a Church e&s;tabli&s;h'd by Law, with
Power of Di&s;cipline; And &s;eeing there appear'd &s;o
much Pre&s;umption, both in the Manner and in the
Matter of his Defence; The <HI>Pre&s;bytery</HI> did mo&s;t
ju&s;tly require the Civil Magi&s;trate, to take care
that &s;uch &s;hould not be admitted to preach to the
People.</P>
<P>The Magi&s;trates of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> who were at the
&s;ame time call'd upon by great Numbers of People,
by a Petition, craving, That a Re&s;traint might be
put to &s;uch Abu&s;es, did neverthele&s;s proceed with
the outmo&s;t Moderation and Tenderne&s;s and on|ly
<PB N="223" REF="234">
call'd the Complainer before them, admoni&s;h|ing
him to forbear Preaching, and obey the Sen|tence
of the <HI>Pre&s;bytery;</HI> Which he having tran&s;|gre&s;s'd,
and thereby contemn'd both <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical</HI>
and <HI>Civil Authority;</HI> The Magi&s;trates did Impri|&s;on
him, untill he &s;hould find Caution for his good
Behaviour and Obedience.</P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>James Green&s;hields</HI> the Complainer, has
rather cho&s;en to pre&s;ent this Bill of Su&s;pen&s;ion,
hoping without doubt, if he may prevail, a Door
may be open'd to greater Di&s;orders, and has for
that End &s;tuft his <HI>Bill</HI> with many Things Foreign
to the Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;ons of <HI>Su&s;pen&s;ion</HI> are u&s;her'd in with a
Narrative of the Complainer's being Legally Or|dain'd
a <HI>Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel,</HI> and his having &s;ome|time
&s;erv'd the Cure at the Church of <HI>Tynan</HI> in
<HI>Ireland,</HI> under a Prebend of <HI>Armagh,</HI> by which
one &s;hould be attempted to believe he had been
Ordain'd in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and afterwards had preach'd
there, till he had come over to <HI>Scotland</HI> lately, and
after his incon&s;i&s;tent Way, he is a <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> of the
<HI>Church of Scotland, England,</HI> and <HI>Ireland;</HI> but by
Authority of no legal Million in the&s;e, or any
Church whatever, and what Incorporation he will
find to joyn all the&s;e, is hardly to be fore&s;een:
The Truth is, That he is not legally Ordain'd at
<HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> any where; but being a <HI>Curate</HI> under a
<HI>Prebendary</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> is come, by his private Au|thority,
to create Di&s;turbances here.</P>
<P>The Complainer pretends to give good Evi|dence
of his Affection and Qualifications to the
Government; but the Ordination from an <HI>Ex|auctorate
Bi&s;hop,</HI> who never own'd its Authority,
nor the Supremacy of King <HI>William,</HI> nor of Her
Maje&s;ty; as by their own Principles they ought;
<PB N="224" REF="235">
and the Complalner's Coming over to di&s;turb the
E&s;tabli&s;hment of the <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>People,</HI> &s;o well
affected to <HI>Civil Government,</HI> and the <HI>Prote&s;tant Suc|ce&s;&s;ion:</HI>
The warm Support the Complainer meets
with here, from People who have given no good
Evidence of <HI>Affection</HI> to it, I &s;ay, this Conduct
does very ill agree with the pretended <HI>Loyalty</HI> the
Complainer boa&s;ts of.</P>
<P>It were unnece&s;&s;ary to give the Lord Ordinary
the Trouble, to examine the Account the Com|plainer
gives of his being invited to preach, and
u&s;e the <HI>Service</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> here, of
which he will be hardly able to give any good
Evidence, neither will it be to the pre&s;ent Pur|po&s;e
to give particular An&s;wers to &s;everal other
affected Rea&s;ons, no Ways belonging to the Ca&s;e,
and therefore the Good Town &s;hall content them|&s;elves
to an&s;wer only &s;uch Rea&s;ons, which may
&s;eem to concern the Subject of the Complaint.</P>
<P>The Complainer's fir&s;t Rea&s;on is, That, being
Ordain'd a lawful <HI>Mini&s;ter,</HI> he has the Benefit of
the 16th Act of the Meeting of the E&s;tates of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> whereby it is <HI>prohibited and di&s;charg'd,
that any Injury be offer'd by any Per&s;on what&s;omever,
to any Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, either in their Churches
or Meeting-Hou&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>But the Complaner forgets the following Words,
(<HI>Who are pre&s;ently in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and Exerci&s;e of
their Mini&s;try therein, and behave as becomes under
the pre&s;ent Government</HI>) and it's certain, the Com|plainer
neither does, nor pretends to &s;ub&s;ume in
the Terms of the Act, nor of any of the Acts
mention'd in his <HI>Bill;</HI> and it were a Matter of
very bad Con&s;equence, if the <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> of the
<HI>Church,</HI> and the <HI>Magi&s;trates,</HI> in this Part of Her
Maje&s;ty's Kingdom, &s;hould admit a Per&s;on to
<PB N="225" REF="236">
preach upon a pretended Ordination, by an Au|thority
aboli&s;h'd by the <HI>Civil Power,</HI> and contrary
to the <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tick E&s;tabli&s;hment;</HI> the&s;e, whom the
Act of the <HI>Convention</HI> did protect, were <HI>Mini&s;ters,</HI>
who, at lea&s;t, were own'd as &s;uch by one Side or
other; but this Complainer is in a quite different
Ca&s;e, being Ordain'd in Manner fore&s;aid; nor
does this Que&s;tion only concern this Part of the
I&s;land, for there were <HI>Exauctorated Bi&s;hops</HI> in <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
at the Time of the <HI>Revolution,</HI> as well as in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> but never any &s;uch were allowed to Or|dain,
which would be to allow a perpetual Schi&s;m.</P>
<P>2. The Complainer does much in&s;i&s;t upon the
Church's Want of Power over others, than the&s;e of
their own Communion, but at the &s;ame time ac|knowledges,
the Church has the Power of Di&s;ci|pline,
as to Immoralities and Errors, and that the
Civil Magi&s;trate ought to put their Sentence in
Execution: Now, by the Complainer's own Way
of Rea&s;oning, the Church had good Rea&s;on to en|quire,
Whether he was a Mini&s;ter or no? And if
he was not, to re&s;train him, as not having a Mi&s;&s;i|on
from any Authority acknowledg'd by any
<HI>Church,</HI> and con&s;equently the <HI>Magi&s;trates</HI> were in
their Duty to put the Sentence in Execution, and
might have puni&s;h'd the Complainer per&s;onally;
but yet they have contented them&s;elves only to
Impri&s;on him, till he finds Caution for Obedience.</P>
<P>The good Town does reckon them&s;elves in this
Ca&s;e concern'd to an&s;wer, what the Petitioner en|deavours
to &s;et forth &s;o earne&s;tly, That he &s;uffers
for u&s;ing the Ceremonies of the Church of <HI>England,</HI>
tho' it is very plain, that the&s;e Ceremonies had not,
at the Time of the Revolution, the Authority of
any Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Judicature, nor Civil in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
nor can ever have it now. Nor is it le&s;s certain,
that by the Complainer's own Principles, no Forms
<PB N="226" REF="237">
can be introduc'd into any <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> Church, with|out
Concour&s;e of both: But the Complainer being
no <HI>Pre&s;byter</HI> of any Sort and in Effect a <HI>Lay-Man,</HI>
was ju&s;tly call'd by the <HI>Pre&s;bytery,</HI> and forbid to
preach which is enough to &s;upport the <HI>Pre&s;bytery's</HI>
Sentence, as that Sentence is &s;ufficient Ground for
the Magi&s;trates to have proceeded, as they have
done.</P>
<P>And where the Complainer alledges, That the
Magi&s;trates had no Warrant, by any &s;pecial Law,
to Impri&s;on in the Ca&s;e fore&s;aid.</P>
<P>It is an&s;wer'd, That all the Parts of the Magi|&s;trates
Authority need not &s;pecial Acts, <HI>Conce&s;&s;a
Juri&s;dictione ea omnia conce&s;&s;a videntur, &s;ine quibus
exerceri non pote&s;t;</HI> The Magistrates have Power to
prevent Di&s;orders, and are in Law bound to &s;ee
the lawful Sentences of the Church put to Execu|tion
again&s;t the Scandalous, Erroneous and De|pos'd
Clergy-men, and much more again&s;t &s;uch
who pretend a Mi&s;&s;ion in Defiance to the publick
Law, and having that Power, they have thereby
the Power of Impri&s;onment, without which, the
other could not take Effect.</P>
<P>But to give the Lords a plain Account of this
Matter, by the Act of Parliament 1663, it is ex|pre&s;ly
Statute, <HI>That no Per&s;on be continued or allow'd
to be a Preacher within this Church, unle&s;s be comply
with the Conditions there &s;et down;</HI> And more par|ticularly,
<HI>That no Preacher be allow'd or continued
within the &s;ame, unle&s;s he actually ob&s;erve the Unifor|mity
of Wor&s;hip ob&s;erv'd in this Church;</HI> And by the
6th Act of Parliament, 1707, the fore&s;aid Act is
Ratify'd; and it is expre&s;ly provided, <HI>That the
Form and Purity of Wor&s;hip pre&s;ently in U&s;e within
this Church, &s;hall remain and continue unalterable;</HI>
And this is yet more &s;olemnly &s;ecur'd by the Trea|ty
of Union. Now, if after all this, a Man from
<PB N="227" REF="238">
<HI>Ireland,</HI> pretending to be a lawful Minister, and
who yet can give no Account of a good Ordina|tion,
&s;hall come and preach here, and let up and
u&s;e Foreign Rites and Ceremonies, contrary to the
Purity and Uniformity of Wor&s;hip e&s;tabli&s;hsd in
this Church; can there be any thing more proper
for the Church, than to take Notice, and Re&s;train
&s;uch a vagrant pe&s;tilent Practi&s;er; &s;pecially when
he acknowledges, if he were preaching Error, he
might be re&s;train'd by virtue of the fore&s;aid Acts?
But &s;o it is, that the&s;e Acts are equally for the Pu|rity
and Uniformity of Wor&s;hip again&s;t all Inno|vations,
as they are for the Truth of the Confe&s;&s;ion
of Faith again&s;t Error, and con&s;equently it did be|long
to the Church and <HI>Pre&s;bytery,</HI> to take Notice
of this Complainer, having no lawful Character,
and practi&s;ing &s;o di&s;orderly contrary to Law; and
the lea&s;t they could do, was to forbid and di&s;|charge
him, which he contemning, the Church is
&s;o warranted by the &s;ame Law, to apply to the
Civil Magi&s;trates, to make their Sentences Effe|ctual;
and the Civil Magi&s;trate could not in Law
take any other Method to that Effect, than what
they have done: And the Imprisonment that hath
hereon en&s;ued, is more warrantable, no ways with|in
the Compa&s;s of the Act again&s;t wrongous Im|pri&s;onment,
&s;ince it expre&s;&s;y excepts all Impri&s;on|ments
by Virtue of Sentences; And therefore, &s;ince
the Complainer has been &s;o Di&s;orderly and Tur|bulent,
and that both the Eccle&s;ia&s;tick and Civil
Judicatory have proceeded again&s;t him mo&s;t le|gally
and regularly, and that in Effect he may re|lieve
him&s;elf when he will, if he can but bow to a
ju&s;t Compliance, in all Rea&s;on and good Sen&s;e, his
Bill ought to be refus'd.</P>

of Impri&s;onment thereupon, (all which I
&s;end you inclos'd) namely, <HI>My bringing Rites and
Ceremonies into this Place, contrary to the Purity and
Uniformity of their Wor&s;hip:</HI> I &s;ay, in&s;tead of con|&s;idering
this, the Lords went off the State of the
Que&s;tion, and finding no Way to attack me, as I
think, legally, fell upon a Notion afforded 'em by
the Magi&s;trates An&s;wer to my Bill, and fir&s;t broach$d
by Sir <HI>J&mdash;s St&mdash;t, That no Mini&s;ter ordain'd by an
Exauctorated Bi&s;hop</HI> (for &s;uch they call all the Right
Reverend Bi&s;hops of this Church) <HI>has true Ordina|tion.</HI>
What their Lord&s;hips Rea&s;onings were upon
this Head, I de&s;ign to publi&s;h at large; and &s;hall
now only mention two of 'em. The fir&s;t was of
the Lord <HI>M</HI>&mdash;<HI>o,</HI> who, after my Lord <HI>Gr</HI>&mdash;<HI>ge</HI>
had a&s;&s;erted and fully prov'd the Validity of my
Ordination, not only from the Principles and
Practices of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> but al&s;o of
their own Kirk, learnedly confuted all he had
&s;aid, by this one po&s;itive A&s;&s;ertion, <HI>That an ex|auctorated
Bi&s;hop has no more Power to ordain a Mi|ni&s;ter,
than a Ballad-Cryer in the Streets;</HI> and this
was &s;upported by another Lord's Opinion, <HI>That
he had no more Power to Ordain, than a depos'd Co|lonel
or Captain of Hor&s;e has to give Commi&s;&s;ions to
Subalterns;</HI> &s;o that upon the whole, my Bill was
refus'd, and I bereft of all Hopes that Way; &s;o
that I am forc'd to appeal to Her Maje&s;ty, and
the Hou&s;e of Lords, from who&s;e great Equity,
Moderation, and Ju&s;tice, I hope for that Redre&s;s,
which I am &s;o unhappy as not to be able to ob|tain
in my Native Country. For, be&s;ides the
Hard&s;hip of my Ca&s;e in particular; I pre&s;ume to
<PB N="232" REF="243">
&s;ay, if my Per&s;ecutors are permitted to treat my
<HI>Epi&s;copal Brethren,</HI> as they do, <HI>ad libitum,</HI> and with
Impunity, I am afraid they will attempt the Re|vival
of their old <HI>Solemn League and Covenant.</HI>
For, that many of them think that &s;till binding
on 'em, the following In&s;tance, among&s;t many
others, may evince. At <HI>Sterling,</HI> within the&s;e ten
Weeks, they were placing a Mini&s;ter; <HI>Logan,</HI>
who was the Preacher, and examin'd the new In|trant,
a&s;k'd him among&s;t many other Que&s;tions in
the Church of <HI>Sterling,</HI> many Hundreds pre&s;ent,
<HI>Whether be believ'd that the National, and Solemn
League, and Covenant, as it was binding upon their
Fathers, who took it, &s;o al&s;o it was equally binding
upon them?</HI> And he was an&s;wer'd, <HI>he believ'd it
was;</HI> which is <HI>downright Trea&s;on,</HI> and contrary to
many Acts of Parliament unrepeal'd. So that I
think it may well be fear'd, that re&s;tle&s;s Tribe,
who are of this Opinion, may once again attempt
the Reformation of the Church of <HI>England</HI> to their
Model, and endeavour to propagate the &s;ame Re|bellious
Notions in the Southern Parts of the
I&s;land. So that a <HI>Toleration</HI> of <HI>Epi&s;copal Mini&s;ters</HI>
here, &s;eems to be highly nece&s;&s;ary for the Preser|vation
of the <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Union</HI> of both Kingdoms,
the Service of Her Maje&s;ty, and Safety of the
Church happily e&s;tabli&s;h'd in <HI>England.</HI> As for
the Mini&s;ters of the other Per&s;wa&s;ions, whatever
<HI>Pretences</HI> they may make to Loyalty, I can affirm,
that there are two <HI>Epi&s;copal Mini&s;ters,</HI> who have
taken the Oaths to Her Maje&s;ty, for one of them,
in Proportion to their different Numbers; that
before I came to this City, I heard Nine of them
preach and pray, and never heard one of them
name the Queen in their Prayers. Nay, &s;ome of
them had the In&s;olence and Hardine&s;s, to tell their
Congregations on the late Thanksgiving Day ap|pointed
<PB N="233" REF="244">
by Her Maje&s;ty and Council, <HI>That they
were not come there out of any Obedience to the Queen's
Proclamation; but to their Synod, which had enjoin'd
that Thank&s;giving for their good Harve&s;t.</HI></P>

pu&s;h'd at, and carry'd Higher-Points than

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Giving an Account of the Endeavours of
the Epi&s;copal and Jacobite-Party in
Scotland, for the Inva&s;ion of the
Presbyterian Church, declaring the
&V;nion alterable and breaking in upon
the expre&s;s Articles of it; with their
Succe&s;s in both.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Hou&s;e of Lords, as is no|ted
before, tho' they had
effectually revers'd the Sen|tence
of the Magi&s;trates of
<HI>Edinb.</HI> again&s;t Mr. <HI>Green&s;hields,</HI>
yet having not adven|tured
to meddle with the Juri&s;diction of the
Church, or determin'd, one Way or other,
the Validity of the Sentence of the <HI>Pre&s;|bytery.</HI>
The Victory the <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> Party
had obtain'd thereby, was not &s;o compleat as
it was expected; neither did it any Way
an&s;wer the End of the Party, and therefore
&s;till finding, as I &s;aid before, the Juncture
<PB N="235" REF="246">
favourable, and their Party &s;o predominant,
that they thought nothing could be deny'd
them, they proceeded to &s;uch farther At|tempts
in Parliament, in the Year 1711-12, as,
till then, it was generally thought they had
A&s;&s;urance enough to hope for, neither did
many of their own Party think it was po&s;&s;i|ble
for them to go the length we have &s;ince
found them: But this being an Age of Won|ders,
nothing is now to &s;eem Strange.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Step they took of this kind, was
to brirg in a <HI>Toleration</HI> into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and
to Repeal &s;uch Acts of Parliament which
&s;tood in their Way.</P>
<P>It was objected, That the&s;e Acts of Parli|ament
were included in the Treaty of <HI>Union,</HI>
and that the Treaty was E&s;&s;ential, and Un|alterable;
that the Power of the <HI>Briti&s;h Par|liament</HI>
could not extend to it, and this, in|deed,
was allow'd for a Rea&s;on, in the Par|liament
before, when an Attempt of the like
Nature being offer'd, it was an&s;wer'd, <HI>That
the Parliament had not Power to do it.</HI></P>
<P>But to evade this; a New Propo&s;ition was
&s;tarted, viz. That every Act of the <HI>Con&s;ti|tution</HI>
was alterable by the Sovereign Power,
or Supreme Authority of the &s;aid <HI>Con&s;titu|tion;</HI>
but to leave it with more Authority,
I &s;hall give it you in their own Words, <HI>viz.
Are not they Blockheads</HI> who &s;ay, <HI>That any
Thing is</HI> unalterable, <HI>becau&s;e the Law &s;ays
'tis</HI> unalterable? <HI>Is there not a particular
<PB N="236" REF="247">
Act of Parliament in</HI> Scotland, <HI>which declares
the Lineal Succe&s;&s;ion of the Royal Family</HI> un|alterable?
<HI>And is it not Trea&s;on to &s;ay,</HI>
That <HI>that could not be alter'd?</HI> Certainly,
where-ever there is a Sovereign Power they
not only can, but have alter'd every Thing,
which many fooli&s;hly think is either unal|terable
in its own Nature, or the Law has
declar'd unalterable: He is a Stranger to our
<HI>Con&s;titution</HI> who can call any thing Funda|mental
but the pre&s;ent <HI>Con&s;titution.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this Foot they made no Scruple to
lay Schemes for over-turning the Whole
E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Church in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
and undoing all that was &s;ettled there by the
Union. I &s;hall not make this a Di&s;cour&s;e of
Controver&s;ie, about the Power the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI>
Parliament has, or has not, to alter, or re&s;ind
the Union; but I may, as a Quotation, give
you &s;omething which was then offer'd in
Oppo&s;ition to that Notion; It is no matter
by whom, and which, till an&s;wer'd, may
remain as an E&s;&s;ential, or Fundamental, upon
which tho&s;e People, who laid a Stre&s;s upon
the Union, built their Claim.</P>
<P>The De&s;igns of the <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> and <HI>Jacobite</HI>
Party, <HI>for they are but one Party and one Peo|ple,</HI>
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> having been manife&s;tly driven
on, at the Ruin of the <HI>Pre&s;byterian E&s;tabli&s;h|ment</HI>
there; they knew it was impo&s;&s;ible to
bring this to pa&s;s, but by Sapping the Foun|dations
of the <HI>Union,</HI> which had declar'd the
<PB N="237" REF="248">
&s;aid E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Church, as well as
many other Things, to be <HI>Unalterable:</HI> This
crabbed unhappy Word they could not bear,
for if it remain'd, they could never Ma&s;ter
the <HI>Pre&s;byterian Settlement,</HI> which was the
Eye-Sore of the Party, both there and here,
and which the <HI>Union</HI> had perpetuated.</P>
<P>To this purpo&s;e they bent all their little
Cavils at this fatal Word <HI>Unalterable,</HI> which
if they could hut <HI>get over,</HI> every Thing would
be ea&s;ie to them <HI>after it;</HI> and as often as they
can get a <HI>Jacobite</HI> A&s;cendant in the Mini&s;try,
or Parliament, they will pu&s;h at that Funda|mental
Con&s;titution of <HI>Britain,</HI> the <HI>Union.</HI></P>
<P>To come therefore clo&s;e to the Point, I
&s;hall Examin the Validity of this Word <HI>Un|alterable,</HI>
in the Articles of <HI>Union,</HI> and in do|ing
this, I think it will appear,</P>
<P>1. That it is the only E&s;&s;ential, which gives
Strength and Value to that Great Tran&s;action,
and that all the re&s;t is of no Con&s;equence or
Con&s;ideration without it.</P>
<P>2. That without it, <HI>the whole Union</HI> is a
Cheat, a Snare laid to Entrap a whole Nati|on,
a Politick Fraud, back'd with Court A&s;&s;u|rances,
Royal Authorities, and Parliamentary
Ratifications, on purpo&s;e to draw in an Inno|cent
People to depend upon empty Notions,
Incon&s;i&s;tent in them&s;elves, and of no Signifi|cation.</P>
<P>3. That without it, Her Maje&s;ty would
&s;eem not only to deceive Her&s;elf in the Joy
<PB N="238" REF="249">
She conceiv'd at the making the <HI>Union,</HI> but
Her People al&s;o, in the Hopes She gave them
of the future Peace and Happine&s;s they might
expect, as the Con&s;equences of this <HI>Union;
vid. Her Maje&s;ty's Speeches to the Parliament
at the pa&s;&s;ing the Act of</HI> Union, <HI>and &s;everal
before, during the Treaty.</HI></P>
<P>4. That the Makers of this <HI>Union,</HI> both in
<HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> understood it to be
UNALTERABLE, and that as &s;uch, it
pa&s;s'd in tho&s;e very Terms, and that there|fore
the Words <HI>Alterable</HI> and <HI>Unalterable,</HI>
were put into the Treaty, where they &s;tand
as a Te&s;timony again&s;t them.</P>
<P>If this be prov'd, then I firmly believe I
prove, That no Con&s;tituted Human Power
upon Earth has a Legal Right to ALTER,
Explain, Add to, or Dimini&s;h from that
Treaty; and that when any Infraction is
made into it, by any Power which receives
its Con&s;titution from it, that Con&s;titution,
<HI>the Union being broken,</HI> dies, di&s;&s;olves, and
cea&s;es to be a Con&s;titution from that Time, by
the very Nature of the very <HI>Union.</HI></P>
<P>As I am writing to the common Under|&s;tanding,
&s;o I appeal to every Reader, whe|ther
it was not our Expectation or Belief,
That an Eternal End was put to the Strife
of the Two Nations; whether it was not
under&s;tood, That neither had Power to break
this <HI>Union?</HI> Whether it was not the gene|ral
receiv'd Notion we had of it, That it was
<PB N="239" REF="250">
as much <HI>Unalterable,</HI> as any thing in Human
Nature could be &s;o, or as the Wit and Capa|city
of Men could devi&s;e?</P>
<P>But come we next to the <HI>Union it&s;elf:</HI> Why
is it &s;aid in the 17th, and the 18th, and the
19th Articles of the <HI>Union,</HI> and &s;everal others,
That &s;uch and &s;uch Parts &s;hall be <HI>neverthe|le&s;s
alterable</HI> by a Parliament of <HI>Great Bri|tain?</HI>
And why is it &s;aid in others <HI>Unalter|able,
and without any Alteration for ever,</HI> as
in the <HI>Act for the Security of the Church of</HI>
England, <HI>as well as of the Church of</HI> Scotland,
Article 25? Does not the expre&s;&s;ing, That
this or that Part &s;hall be <HI>Alterable,</HI> mo&s;t
&s;trongly infer, That the re&s;t is to be un|der&s;tood,
not to be <HI>Alterable,</HI> even by the
Parliament? And does not the expre&s;s Ar|ticling
in the Act of Security afore&s;aid, That
&s;uch a Thing &s;hall be <HI>Unalterable,</HI> and &s;hall
for that purpo&s;e be incerted in, and made
part of the <HI>Act of Union</HI> unan&s;werably con|firm,
That what was in the &s;aid <HI>Union,</HI> was
of cour&s;e <HI>Unalterable,</HI> except otherwi&s;e ex|pre&s;s'd,
becau&s;e the <HI>Union</HI> it&s;elf was &s;o?</P>
<P>But a Difficulty remains here, which they
think we dare not enter into, for fear of the
Parliament, <HI>viz.</HI> What do we mean by <HI>Un|alterable?</HI>
Is it, or can any thing be <HI>Unalter|able</HI>
by the Parliament of <HI>Britain?</HI> Or is
any Thing <HI>Unalterable</HI> by a Sovereign Power?
And this is their boa&s;t.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Jacobites</HI> &s;hew their Weakne&s;s
<PB N="240" REF="251">
here, and are mi&s;taken in our Parliament;
for a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, having the Bounds
of their Sovereign Power declared <HI>in the
Laws,</HI> in the Claims of Right, in the <HI>Cu&s;tom
and U&s;age</HI> of Parliament, and in the known
Parts of the Con&s;titution, are never di&s;plea&s;ed
that the Subjects of <HI>Britain,</HI> the Freeholders
and Freemen whom they repre&s;ent, &s;hould
know the Powers, Rights, and Foundations
upon which they act, and all the &s;everal
Extents and Limitations of tho&s;e Powers,
Rights, and Foundations.</P>
<P>And what a Scandal and Reproach do &s;uch
Men ca&s;t on a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament? Or what
kind of a Mon&s;ter would they make of it,
That a Man &s;hould not dare to &s;peak Known,
Legal, and Nece&s;&s;ary Truths for fear of their
Re&s;entment? As if a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, <HI>horri$
Sugge&s;tion!</HI> Could be &s;uppos'd to re&s;ent, or
be offended at a plain, ju&s;t, clear Repre&s;enta|tion
of Truth in Fact, whether relating to
their own Con&s;titution, or any thing el&s;e:
The Parliament are our Protectors in that
Happy Liberty of <HI>&s;peaking plain Truths,</HI> the
want of which Liberty makes other Nations
Slaves, and comfortably di&s;tingui&s;hes <HI>English|men</HI>
from all the Nations of the World.</P>
<P>And therefore it is no Trea&s;on, or Offence,
to &s;ay, The Parliament <HI>cannot</HI> do this or that,
or <HI>have not</HI> this or that Power, for it is ap|parent,
That the Parliament may have &s;ome,
<HI>and really have &s;everal</HI> Limitations to their
<PB N="241" REF="252">
Legal Power. And as I am now &s;peaking to
<HI>Jacobites,</HI> what if I &s;hould throw into their
Teeth, <HI>their own Doctrine</HI> of the Divine Right
of the Per&s;on of the Prince, and the De&s;cent
of the Crown <HI>in the right Line,</HI> which they
call <HI>Inderfeizible,</HI> and which they &s;ay is <HI>not in
the Power</HI> of Parliament to <HI>alter?</HI> Tho' this
is far from being my Opinion, and I think it
a ridiculous Sy&s;tem, yet it is <HI>upon this Foot
alone that they can remain Jacobites;</HI> and
therefore It is a good Rea&s;on to them, and
an Argument which I believe they cannot
an&s;wer.</P>
<P><HI>But to de&s;cend plianly to the thing:</HI> With
all Deference and Duty to the Parliament,
and as I think, with a well-guided Zeal to
the Con&s;titution; I &s;hall lay down my No|tion
of the <HI>Unalterable</HI> Quality of the <HI>Union,</HI>
and the Rea&s;on why I think, even the Par|liament
it&s;elf cannot <HI>ALTER</HI> one Tittle of
it, except what is declared in the Act of
<HI>Union</HI> to be <HI>Alterable.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I lay down my A&s;&s;umption thus:</HI> Every
Power on Earth derives from &s;ome others
Power Prior, and therefore Superiour to it
&s;elf as every Created Being is inferior, both
in Dignity and Power, to <HI>that Being which
created it.</HI></P>
<P>The Two &s;eparate Con&s;titutions of <HI>Eng|land</HI>
and <HI>Scotland,</HI> from which <HI>in their Treat|ing
Capacity, the pre&s;ent united</HI> Con&s;titution
of <HI>Britain</HI> was produced, being Prior to, and
creating <HI>this united Constitution,</HI> were <HI>in that
<PB N="242" REF="253">
Capacity,</HI> &s;uperior to the pre&s;ent <HI>Con&s;titution,</HI>
as they were prior to, and created it.</P>
<P>I infer from hence, That the &s;aid Two
&s;eparate <HI>Con&s;titutions</HI> of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI>
having by <HI>Treaty and mutual Stipulation,
which is called the Union,</HI> formed and con|&s;tituted,
or created one Body, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Pre|&s;ent
Con&s;titution, the Body &s;o formed, is the
Daughter or Child of that Union.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I infer next,</HI> That this <HI>Union</HI> of the Two
<HI>Con&s;titutions,</HI> having produced this &s;aid Body,
or &s;ub&s;equent <HI>Constitution,</HI> had a Power to
bind and limit the &s;aid <HI>&s;ub&s;equent,</HI> which
Bounds and Limits, the &s;aid <HI>&s;ub&s;equent,
which is the pre&s;ent Con&s;titution of</HI> Britain,
has no Legal Right to break.</P>
<P>If this be true, then I &s;ee no Crime in a&s;|&s;erting,
That the <HI>Briti&s;h Parliament</HI> cannot
go beyond the Limits of the <HI>Treaty;</HI> it is our
Satisfaction that the <HI>Parliament is &s;itting,</HI>
while this is Writing, and &s;o we know who
hears: Let then the <HI>Jacobite Party,</HI> who
&s;tand openly up for a Breach of the <HI>Trea|ty,</HI>
and would fain involve us in Confu|&s;ion
I &s;ay, let <HI>them</HI> &s;tand forth, and an|&s;wer
it if they can to the <HI>Parliament, or if
not,</HI> they ought to be cen&s;ured for reproach|ing
the <HI>Briti&s;h Parliament.</HI></P>
<P>It &s;eems a very unhappy Cri&s;is, that a
Treaty of Union being, with the greate&s;t So|lemnity
imaginable, made with the <HI>Scots,</HI>
va&s;t Sums given to the <HI>Scots,</HI> and &s;ome &s;pent
<PB N="243" REF="254">
in the bringing the great Tran&s;action to pa&s;s,
it &s;hould, within le&s;s than five Year, become a
Que&s;tion among us, whither this Union
can be broken by us, or no; it &s;eem'd much
more rea&s;onable to expect, that the Pub|lick
&s;hould have &s;tudy'd Ways and Means
farther to Confirm and E&s;tabli&s;h the &s;aid
Union, and to Cultivate and Improve it, let|ting
the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;ee that they
were Gainers, and &s;hould be improv'd by the
Union, that they &s;hould ta&s;te of the Sweets

Riches encrea&s;e.</P>
<P>But in&s;tead of this, the <HI>Jacobite</HI> and <HI>Epi&s;|copal</HI>
Party &s;tudy'd all the Ways they could
devi&s;e to In&s;ult and Affront the <HI>Con&s;titution</HI>
of the <HI>Church,</HI> and finding all Things ripe
for their De&s;igns, they began in Parliament,
by getting a Bill to be brought in <HI>for &s;et|ting

Tollerating the Epi&s;copal Meetings,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

Church in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and altering the Laws,

When after the great and many Hard&s;hips,
Troubles and Vici&s;&s;itudes, wherewith the Church
of <HI>Scotland</HI> had been to&s;&s;ed even from its fir&s;t Re|formation
from Popery. It plea&s;ed our Gracious
God, at, and by the late Revolution, to ble&s;s us
with a full and compleat Re&s;titution, and that by
the Claim of Right, and the Acts of Parliament
following; <HI>Viz.</HI> The 5th Act of the Parliament
1690, entituled, <HI>An Act for ratifying the Confe&s;&s;ion
of Faith, and &s;ettling pre&s;byterian Church Govern|ment;</HI>
Whereby Pre&s;byterian Church Government
is e&s;tabli&s;h'd, ratify'd and confirm'd, as the only
Government of Chri&s;t's Church within this King|dom,
re&s;cending, annulling, and making void all

of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Proce&s;s and Cen&s;ures; and like|wi&s;e
to redre&s;s all other Church Di&s;orders. By
which Act it is evident, that Pre&s;byterian Church
Government being thus E&s;tabli&s;h'd, the Mini&s;ters
and Elders of this Church have all the Powers
committed by your Lord and Ma&s;ter, to his Mi|ni&s;ters
and Officers, to watch over his Flock, and
to guard it again&s;t all U&s;urpers and Intruders.
<HI>2dly,</HI> By the 23d Act of Parliament 1693, entitl'd,
<HI>An Act for &s;ettling the Quiet and Peace of the Church;</HI>

or Preach within this Church, unle&s;s he fir&s;t
take and &s;ub&s;cribe the Oath of Allegiance and
A&s;&s;urance, and al&s;o &s;ub&s;cribe the Confe&s;&s;ion of

that he Owns and Acknowledges Pre&s;byterian
Church Government to be the only Government
of this Church. And further, That he ob&s;erve
the Uniformity of Wor&s;hip, and of the Admini|&s;tration
of all publick Ordinances, as the &s;ame are
at pre&s;ent performed, and allowed within this
Church; and that no Mini&s;ter or Preacher be ad|mitted

any Pari&s;h, without an Orderly Call from the

Acts, and &s;everal others to that Purpo&s;e, which we
humbly pre&s;ume to lay together for Your Maje&s;ty's
more full Information; We with all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion,
conceive that Pre&s;byterian Church Government is
as fully &s;ettled and &s;ecured as could be devi&s;ed;
and as the Wor&s;hip, Di&s;cipline, and Government
of this Church were complied with, and &s;ubmitted
to without any alteration in all Time, &s;ince the
Reformation, when Pre&s;byterian Government was
e&s;tabli&s;h'd by Law, &s;o there is no Rea&s;on to doubt
but the &s;ame chearful and univer&s;al Compliance
had been given thereto, at, and ever &s;ince the late
happy Revolution, if it had not been for that wo|ful
Seed of Di&s;affection to the Revolution, and
Your Maje&s;ty's Government, as thereby e&s;tabli&s;h'd,
<PB N="249" REF="260">
and which indeed has been the Principal, if not
the only Cau&s;e of the&s;e few Pro&s;ecutions, that oc|ca&s;ion'd
&s;o loud and unju&s;t a Clamour.</P>
<P>But that Your Maje&s;ty may further be &s;atisfied
of the Inju&s;tce of the&s;e Calumnies, wherewith we
are reproach'd for exce&s;&s;ive Rigour, we cannot but
lay before Your Maje&s;ty this pregnant In&s;tance of
our Moderation; That &s;ince our late E&s;tabli&s;hment,
there have been taken in and continu'd Hundreds
of Di&s;&s;enting Mini&s;ters upon the ea&s;ie&s;t Terms;
and we are further a&s;&s;ur'd, that when any ju&s;t
Trial &s;hall be made, we &s;hall ever be found in|clin'd
to all that Chri&s;tian Tenderne&s;s that can be
expected from &s;uch as fear God, and love our Lord
Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in Sincerity; Your Maje&s;ty then, by
what is here humbly represented may plainly per|ceive
what Security we have had for our pre&s;ent
Settlement before the Union; but then, in order
to the Union, and for the facilitating thereof, we
have the Sixth Act of the Parliament 1707, In|titled,
<HI>Act for &s;ecuring the Prote&s;tant Religion and
Pre&s;byterian Government,</HI> whereby the Hail Acts
above &s;et down are ratify'd and approven, and
Your Maje&s;ty furder with Advice and Con&s;ent of
the E&s;tates of Parliament, expre&s;ly provides and
declares, That the fore&s;aid true Prote&s;tant Reli|gion
contained in the above mention'd Confe&s;&s;ion

pre&s;ently in u&s;e within that Church and its <HI>Pre&s;by|terian</HI>
Church Government and Di&s;cipline, all e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
by the afore&s;aid Acts of Parliament, pur|&s;uant
to the Claim of Right, &s;hall remain and con|tinue,
unalterable, and that the laid <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI>
Government &s;hall be the only Government of the
Church within the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and fur|der
after the decea&s;e of Your Maje&s;ty (whom God
long pre&s;erve) the Sovereign &s;ucceeding, &s;hall in
all time coming at his or her Acce&s;&s;ion to the

of the True Prote&s;tant Religion, with the
Government, Wor&s;hip, Di&s;cipline, Rights, and
Priviledges of this Church above by Law E&s;ta|bli&s;h'd;
And it is furder Statute and Ordained,
That this Act of Parliament, with the E&s;tabli&s;h|ment
therein contained, &s;hall be held and ob&s;erved
in all time coming, as a Fundamental and E&s;&s;en|tial
Condition of any Treaty of Union, to be
concluded betwixt the Two Kingdoms, without
any Alteration thereof, or Derogation thereto in
any Sort what&s;oever; as al&s;o, that this Act of
Parliament and Settlement therein contain'd, &s;hall
be incert and repeated in any Act of Parliament
that &s;hould pa&s;s for agreeing and concluding the
aforefaid Treaty of Union betwixt the Two
Kingdoms, and that the &s;ame &s;hall therein be de|clared
to be an E&s;&s;ential and Fundamental Con|dition
of the &s;aid Treaty of Union in all time
coming: And accordingly, and that our Church
might have the Plenary Security above provided,
and that as was then plainly &s;aid, and. as the Acts
&s;ufficiently impor$ our Security above-mentioned,
might be &s;tated and e&s;tabli&s;hed in a manner even
beyond the reach of Parliament. In both Acts
of Parliament pa&s;&s;ed in both Kingdoms, ratifying
approving the Treaty of Union, the afore&s;aid Act
for &s;ecuring the Prote&s;tant Religon and <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI>
Church Government, is expre&s;ly incert and is there|by
Statute and Ordained, That this Act with the
E&s;tabli&s;hment therein contained, &s;hall be held and
ob&s;erved in all Time coming, as a Fundamental

<P>This being our great and plenary Security in

on the other Hand of Alterations and Innova|tions

for the Exerci&s;e of Divine Wor&s;hip in their own
manner, and to u&s;e in their Congregations the
Liturgy of the Church of <HI>England</HI> without any
Di&s;turbance, and that for qualifying &s;uch Pa&s;tors
<HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> Orders, and presenting Letters of their
Orders to the Ju&s;tice of the Peace &s;hall be &s;uffi|cient,
and that no Per&s;on or Per&s;ons, &s;hall incur
any Penalty what&s;oever, upon his or her Re&s;ort|ing
to the &s;aid <HI>Epi&s;copal Meeting,</HI> and that it &s;hall
be Free and Lawful, for all the Subjects in
that Part of <HI>Great Britain</HI> called <HI>Scotland,</HI> to a&s;&s;em|ble

they think fit, and for the <HI>Epi&s;copal Mini&s;ters,</HI> not
only to pray and preach in their Congregations,
but to admini&s;ter the Sacraments, and may with|out
incurring any Pain or Penalty what&s;oever, or
without any other Caveat, That appears for their
Doctrine, &s;ave that they &s;hall not deny in their
preaching or writing of the Doctrine of the Ble&s;&s;ed
Trinity, and withal that the <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> Clergy,
are &s;till allowed to inflict Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Cen&s;ures
upon tho&s;e of their own Communion, which plain|ly
imports an exemption from all, who &s;hall
di&s;own their Communion.</P>
<P>We cannot but in the fir&s;t place expre&s;s our
a&s;toni&s;hing Surprize, and deep Affliction, to hear
of &s;uch Bill offered for &s;uch a large, and almo&s;t
boundle&s;s Toleration, not only threatning the
Overthrow of this CHURCH, but giving a large
Licence, almo&s;t to all Errors and Bla&s;phemies;
<PB N="252" REF="263">
throwing up all good Di&s;cipline to the Di&s;honour
of God, and the Scandal and Ruin of the true
Chri&s;tian Religion, and the infallible Di&s;turbance
of the Quiet, and to the Confu&s;ion of this Church
and Nation, And therefore in the next Place, we
do with all Humility, but with the greate&s;t Ear|ne&s;tne&s;s
be&s;eech, nay obte&s;t Your Maje&s;ty by the
&s;ame Mercy of GOD that re&s;tored this Church,
and rai&s;ed Your Maje&s;ty to the Throne, to inter|po&s;e
for the Relief of this Church, and the Main|tenance
of the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment, again&s;t &s;uch
a manife&s;t and ruining Encroachment, in &s;uch
manner, as in your Royal Wi&s;dom and Ju&s;tice
You &s;hall think needful.</P>

Sic Sub&s;cribitur, William Mitchel, <HI>Moderator.</HI></P></Q></P>
<P>This Repre&s;entation was pre&s;ented to the
Qpeen by the &s;ame three Mini&s;ters above-Mentioned who pre&s;ented the Petition to the
Hou&s;e, being introduced to Her Maje&s;ty by
the Earl of <HI>Dartmouth,</HI> Secretary of State,
they had a very Gracious Reception by Her
Maje&s;ty. But the Queen an&s;wer'd only in ge|neral
Terms, <HI>That She &s;hould take the Church
of</HI> Scotland <HI>always into Her Protection; that
She was &s;en&s;ible of their Dutiful Behaviour,
and was concern'd for their Peace and Well|fare;
that the pre&s;ent Affair was before the
Parliament; that &s;he did not u&s;ually concern
<PB N="253" REF="264" MS="Y">
Her&s;elf to interpo&s;e while any Bill was depen|ding
in the Hou&s;es, but that, when it came before
Her, She &s;hould act as She thought mo&s;t for the
good of</HI> Scotland: And more to this Effect.</P>
<P>In the mean Time the Bill pa&s;s'd the
Lower-Hou&s;e: There had been a Motion
made in the Hou&s;e to oblige the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI>
tolerated by this Bill, to take the Oaths of
Alleigance and Abjuration; but it was alleg'd,
That many of the <HI>Pre&s;bytertan</HI> Mini&s;ters de|clin'd
the &s;aid <HI>Abjuration;</HI> and it would be
hard to put the Epi&s;copal People to take any
more Oaths than the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church
took: This the Hou&s;e ob&s;erving, let the Bill
pa&s;s, and allow'd the Epi&s;copal <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> to
have their Meetings and their Liberty, with|out
taking any Oaths at all.</P>
<P>But it went not thorough the Hou&s;e of
Lords &s;o, for the Three Mini&s;ters before
mentioned, who had Petition'd the <HI>Commons,</HI>
apply'd them&s;elves, by Petition, to the <HI>Hou&s;e
of Lords,</HI> and obtain'd to be heard by <HI>Coun|cil</HI>
again&s;t the Bill; which being done, the
Lords made two Amendments to the Bill;
<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That, in all the Epi&s;copal Meetings
which were tollerated, the Mini&s;ter &s;hould
take the Oaths to the Queen: <HI>Secondly,</HI> They
made a little Alteration in the <HI>Abjuration-Oath,</HI> to &s;atisfie the Scruples of the <HI>Pre&s;by|terian</HI>
Mini&s;ters, by putting out the Words
AS THE SAME, and putting in&s;tead
thereof the Word WHICH. The Reader,
in the Copy of the Act which follows, will
<PB N="254" REF="265">
ea&s;ily &s;ee the rea&s;on of the Alteration, and
that it was no way E&s;&s;ential to the Oath, or
gave the lea&s;t room to in&s;inuate <HI>Jacobite</HI> Prin|ciples
were the rea&s;on of it: But when the
Bill came down to the <HI>Hou&s;e of Commons,</HI>
that &s;mall Favour could not be obtain'd, and
tho&s;e who were content to excu&s;e the <HI>Jaco|bite</HI>
Epi&s;copal Clergy from taking the Oaths
at all, would not abate a Scrupulous, Con&s;ci|encious
<HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> the Explanation of one
Word by another not in the lea&s;t E&s;&s;ential
to the Nature, or Sub&s;tance of the Oath.</P>
<P>The <HI>Commons</HI> therefore agreeing to <HI>the
Lords,</HI> in their Judgment for obliging the
Epi&s;copal Mini&s;ters to take the Oaths, yet
di&s;agreed to the other; and the Lords gave
it up; &s;o the Act was pa&s;s'd; the Con&s;e|quences
none can yet fore&s;ee.</P>
<P>The Act, as well to let my Reader &s;ee
the Particulars above, as al&s;o that they may
&s;et it again&s;t the Act of Union, and &s;ee how
they Corre&s;pond, I have here incerted, at lea&s;t

<P>This Bill needs no Comment; the Hi&s;to|ry

it, is like, for many Years, to be the Ex|planation,
both of the Act, and of the De&s;ign
of the Party that pu&s;h'd it on.</P>
<P>But they are not to be expected to &s;top
here: The, next Step we find them taking,
&s;trikes at the Root of the <HI>Pre&s;byterian Settle|ment</HI>
it&s;elf, and aims at the Planting <HI>Epi&s;copacy</HI>
it&s;elf in the very Pari&s;h-Churches of <HI>Scotland;</HI>
this is by re&s;toring the Right of Patronage
in <HI>Scotland:</HI> It may be needful to &s;peak a
Word or two to this very briefly.</P>
<P>The Right of Patronage, or pre&s;enting
Mini&s;ters to Pari&s;hes, as it was Originally
<HI>Popi&s;h,</HI> &s;o it was demoli&s;h'd with <HI>Popery</HI> at
the fir&s;t Reformation in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the People
claiming a Scriptural Right for Choo&s;ing and
Calling their own Mini&s;ters. When <HI>Pre&s;by|tery</HI>
was next put down at the Re&s;toration
of King <HI>Charles</HI> II and <HI>Epi&s;copacy</HI> erected,
this Popi&s;h Claim, tho' methodized after the
<PB N="261" REF="272">
Prote&s;tant Manner, was re-a&s;&s;umed; But in
the Year 90, when <HI>Epi&s;copacy</HI> being aboli&s;h'd,
the <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> Church was e&s;tabli&s;h'd; the
Right of <HI>Patronages,</HI> as incon&s;i&s;tent with the
<HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> Principle, was al&s;o taken away,
and the People re&s;tor'd to the Antient Right,
authorised from in the Scriptures, of Choo&s;ing
and Calling their own Mini&s;ters; and this is
allow'd to be a Fundamental Principle of the
<HI>Pre&s;byterians,</HI> that the People are empower'd
to call their Mini&s;ters, and is expre&s;e'd in the
<HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of the Faith</HI> of the Church of <HI>Scot|land,</HI>
as it is now profe&s;&s;'d by the <HI>Pre&s;byte|rian</HI>
Church, made part of the Act of Parlia|ment
1&s;t <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Mary, Anno</HI> 1690, en|tituled,
<HI>Act e&s;tabli&s;hing the</HI> Prote&s;tant <HI>Reli|gion
and the</HI> Pre&s;byterian <HI>Church Govern|ment.</HI></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this, the Party, re&s;tle&s;s
to get the Churches and Stipends into their
Hands, pu&s;h'd on the De&s;ign, and having
concerted their Mea&s;ures, apply them&s;elves
to the Parliament of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and ob|tain'd
leave, by Motion, to bring in a Bill
for <HI>Re&s;toring the Patronages</HI> in <HI>Scotland;</HI>
which Bill being depending at the Writing
of the&s;e Sheets, the I&s;&s;ue, God willing, &s;hall
either be added as an Appendix to this Work,
or be re&s;erv'd for a farther Account.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time with this they, believing
the Game all their own, move for a Bill to be

<P>After the&s;e Things it is not to be wonder'd

the Conditions and Limitations of the <HI>Suc|ce&s;&s;or,</HI>
which had occa&s;ion'd their earne&s;t
De&s;ire to have the &s;ame regulated, &s;o as that
they might have no Ob&s;truction in the Way

<PB N="263" REF="274">
&s;uch a&s;&s;urances of their <HI>Loyalty</HI> as the Law

<P>The Petition being pre&s;ented to Her Ma|je&s;ty

receiv'd very Graciou&s;ly, and Her Maje&s;ty
was pleas'd to Expre&s;s Her Satisfaction in
the <HI>Loyalty</HI> of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in a
Manner very Obliging.</P>
<P>But this could give no Relief to the People
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who&s;e Scruples could receive no
Satisfaction, or the Law any Relaxation from
the favourable An&s;wer given by the Queen,
the Act being pa&s;s'd as above.</P>
<P>But Things ended not here; this Se&s;&s;ion
was yet more fatal to the Intere&s;t of the
<HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> Church; and the <HI>High-Party</HI>
went on to get all the Hard&s;hips put upon
the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church, which they could
po&s;&s;ibly obtain in a Term of Law.</P>
<P>The next Step, was the Act mentioned

<P><PB N="264" REF="275">
That this was directly Incon&s;i&s;tent with
the Principle of the <HI>Pre&s;byterians,</HI> I need not
&s;pend Time to enlarge on, they having, on

Nameing, Choo&s;ing, and Collating to Bene|fices,

they would make but a very indifferent Plea
of it; for nothing is plainer in their Law,
than that the Tythes were the Patrimony of
that Church, as appears by <HI>Act</HI> 10. <HI>Parl.</HI> 1.
<HI>James</HI> IV. held in 1567, and by many other
Acts. It is likewi&s;e known to every one
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> that Tythes were &s;ettled by the
Legi&s;lature, and that &s;uch Endowments as

Princes could alienate nothing belonging to
the <HI>Crown</HI> without their Con&s;ent. And as
to the Pope's <HI>Canon-Law,</HI> from whence <HI>Pa|tronages</HI>
proceded, it never obtain'd &s;o far in

from many of their Laws, which forbid

the Pragmatical Sanctions betwixt the Popes

as inflexible in this Matter, if not more,
than the Kings of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>But be that how it will; when the Pope's

among the re&s;t, except what part of it
the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> retain'd for its own
Equity, and its Agreeablene&s;s to their <HI>Con|&s;titution,</HI>
which was follow'd in <HI>Comi&s;&s;ar</HI>'s <HI>Courts,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<PB N="266" REF="277">
the Beginning of the <HI>Reformation,</HI> declar'd
again&s;t <HI>Lay-Patronages,</HI> and <HI>Pre&s;entations.</HI>
This appears from the fir&s;t Book of Di&s;ci|pline,
drawn up by Order of the Govern|ment,
and agreed to in the Privy-Council,
<HI>January</HI> 17. 1560, where, in the Fourth
Head, <HI>Concerning the lawful Election of Mi|ni&s;ters,</HI>
the Power of Election is lodg'd in the
Pari&s;honers; and in ca&s;e they delay'd it 40
Days, the <HI>Pre&s;entation</HI> was to be in the <HI>Su|perintendant</HI>
and his <HI>Council, viz.</HI> the Mini|&s;ters
and Elders of his Province.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t General A&s;&s;embly of the Re|formed
Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> held the 20th of
<HI>December</HI> 1560, about four Months after
the Pope's Authority was aboli&s;h'd, it was
enacted, the 27th of the &s;aid Month, <HI>That the
Election of Mini&s;ters &s;hould be in the Publick
Church, by the People, and that Notice &s;hould
be given of it the</HI> Sunday <HI>preceeding.</HI> It
was the &s;ame as to the Election of <HI>Superinten|dants,</HI>
as may be &s;een by the Form of it pre|fix'd
to our Old P&s;alm Books, and in the fir&s;t
Book of Di&s;cipline, under the Head <HI>of the
Election of Superintendants;</HI> and the Church
requir'd, that the <HI>Mini&s;ters,</HI> the <HI>Poor,</HI> and
the <HI>Schools,</HI> &s;hould be provided for out of the
Tythes which were the Patrimony of the
Kirk, as appears by the &s;ixth Head of the fir&s;t
Book of Di&s;cipline, under the Title of <HI>The
Rents and Patrimony of the Church.</HI></P>
<P>In the 3d <HI>Se&s;&s;.</HI> of the 4th General A&s;&s;em|bly
<PB N="267" REF="278">
held at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> it was enacted, <HI>Dec.</HI>
27. 1562. <HI>That the Pre&s;entation of Mini&s;ters
&s;hould be in the People.</HI> Thus Matters were
&s;tated at Queen <HI>Mary's</HI> Arrival from <HI>France,
Aug.</HI> 19, 1561. and the 25th of that Month
her Maje&s;ty declar'd, by Proclamation, That
no-body, on pain of Death, &s;hould attempt
Privately, or Publickly, to make an <HI>Alteration
or Innovation in the State</HI> of Religion which
&s;he found Publickly and Univer&s;ally &s;tand|ing
at her Arrival; and &s;he promis'd not to
attempt any thing again&s;t it her&s;elf, but to
&s;ettle all things with the Con&s;ent of the
States. This Promi&s;e was kept no otherwi&s;e
than as Popi&s;h Princes u&s;e to do with their
Prote&s;tant Subjects; for that &s;he and her
Courtiers were unwilling to part with the
Patronages and Patrimony of the Church
which they had po&s;&s;e&s;s'd them&s;elves of on
the Abrogation of Popery, in&s;omuch that the
poor Mini&s;ters had little el&s;e to maintain
them but the Benevolence of their Hearers;
and with much ado, after many Petitions,
they obtain'd a third of the Tythes, which
was but indifferently paid, &s;o little real de|pendance
had they on Lay-Patrons.</P>
<P>The Church being under the&s;e Pre&s;&s;ures,
&s;he was willing to comply as far as &s;he could
in Con&s;cience, in order to obtain what far|ther
Reformation was wanting, and a Redre&s;s
of her Grievances. Therefore &s;he agreed, in
the A&s;&s;embly of 1565, that Her Maje&s;ty, or
<PB N="268" REF="279">
any other Patron, might pre&s;ent to Vacant
Benefices but on Condition that they pre&s;en|ted
qualify'd Per&s;ons, and &s;ubjected them to
the Examination of the Kirk, <HI>who had the
Right of Collation to the Cure, if the Patron
had the Pre&s;entation to the Benefice;</HI> other|wi&s;e,
&s;ay they, the Patrons might obtrude
&s;uch Per&s;ons as they pleas'd upon them.
And thus, as they complain in the 6th Head
of the fir&s;t Book of Di&s;cipline, <HI>the Papi&s;tical
Tyranny &s;hould be only chang'd into that of
the Lord and Laird;</HI> therefore they requir'd,
that the Kirk might be re&s;tored to her Liber|ty
that &s;he had been cruelly &s;poil'd of by the
<HI>Papi&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>In the &s;econd Book of Di&s;cipline, agreed
on by the General A&s;&s;embly of 1578, regi|&s;ter'd
by that of 1581, and order'd to be
&s;ub&s;crib'd by all Mini&s;ters, they declare
them&s;elves, Chap. 12. thus:</P>
<P>The Liberty of the Election of Per&s;ons call'd
to Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Functions, and ob&s;erv'd with|out
Interruption, &s;o long as the Kirk was not
corrupted by Antichri&s;t, we de&s;ire to be re&s;tored
and retain'd within this Realm, &s;o that none
be intruded upon any Congregation, either by
the Prince, or any inferior Per&s;on, without
lawful Election, and the A&s;&s;ent of the People
over whom the Per&s;on is plac'd, as the Practice
of the Apo&s;tolical and Primitive Kirk and good
Order craves; and becau&s;e this Order which
God's Word craves, cannot &s;tand with Patro|nages
<PB N="269" REF="280">
and Pre&s;entations to Benefices, u&s;ed in
the Pope's Kirk, we de&s;ire all them that truly
fear God, earne&s;tly to con&s;ider, that for a&s; much
as the Names of <HI>Patronages</HI> and <HI>Benefices,</HI>
together with the Effects thereof, have <HI>flow'd
from the Pope, and the Corruption of the</HI>
Canon-Law <HI>only,</HI> in &s;o far as thereby any
Per&s;on was intruded, or placed over Kirks,
having <HI>Curam Animarum:</HI> And fora&s;much
as that manner of Proceeding hath no ground
in the Word of God, but is contrary to the &s;ame,
and to the &s;aid Liberty of Election, they ought
not now to have place in this Light of <HI>Re|formation.</HI>
But as to the&s;e <HI>Patronages</HI> that
have not <HI>Curam Animarum,</HI> as <HI>Chaplain|ries,
Prebendaries,</HI> &amp;c. &s;ounded upon Tempo|ral
Lands, Annuals, and &s;uch like, they may
be re&s;erv'd to the Antient Patrons to di&s;po&s;e
of to <HI>Scholars</HI> and <HI>Bur&s;ars,</HI> according to Act
of Parliament.</P>
<P>This was the Sen&s;e of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scot|land,</HI>
at the <HI>Reformation.</HI> We come next to
&s;hew how the matter &s;tood in Law. The
Courtiers, tho' unwilling to part with the
<HI>Patronages,</HI> agreed, however, that the Power
of <HI>Patrons</HI> &s;hould be re&s;train'd. Thus, by
the 7th Act of the fir&s;t Parliament of King
<HI>James</HI> VI. held <HI>Anno</HI> 1567, it was Enacted,
<HI>That the Examination and Admi&s;&s;ion of Min|ni&s;ters
be only in the Power of the Kirk;</HI> and
that the <HI>Patron</HI> Pre&s;ent a qualify'd Per&s;on
within &s;ix Months (after the Decea&s;e of the
<PB N="270" REF="281">
former Incumbent comes to his Knowledge)
to the <HI>Superintendant</HI> or others, having the
Commi&s;&s;ion of the Kirk, otherwi&s;e the Kirk
to have Power to di&s;po&s;e of the &s;ame to a
qualified Per&s;on. The Qualifications requi|red
were, That he &s;hould agree with the
<HI>Church</HI> in Doctrine, and the Admini&s;tration
of the Sacraments, according to the <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion
of Faith,</HI> as appears by Act 6. Parliament 1.
<HI>James</HI> VI. The Act 46. Parliament 3. of
that &s;ame Prince, enjoyns, That the <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI>
&s;hould be under the Di&s;cipline of the <HI>Kirk,</HI>
partake with her in the Sacraments, and
Sub&s;cribe the Articles of Religion, and give
his Oath for acknowledging the King and his
Authority. And by Parliament 6. Act 68.
<HI>James</HI> VI. they who refu&s;e to Communi|cate
in the Sacraments, as Admini&s;tred in the
Kirk, according to the <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion</HI> of <HI>Faith,</HI> or
contradict the &s;aid <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion,</HI> are declar'd to
be no Members of the Kirk, &s;o long as they
do &s;o, and by the 69th Act of that &s;ame
Parliament 'tis declar'd, <HI>That there be no
other Juri&s;diction Eccle&s;ia&s;tick acknowledg'd
within this Realm, than that which is, and
&s;hall be within the &s;ame Kirk, or that flows
therefrom.</HI> It is here likewi&s;e proper to ob|&s;erve
That by the above-mention'd Act of
1567, in ca&s;e of a Failure, by the <HI>Superin|tendant,</HI>
or <HI>Commi&s;&s;ioner</HI> of the Kirk to ad|mit
a qualify'd Per&s;on, pre&s;ented by the
<HI>Patron,</HI> there lay an Appeal to the <HI>Superin|tendant,</HI>
<PB N="271" REF="282">
and <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> of the Province; and
if they refus'd to admit the qualify'd Per&s;on,
an Appeal was to be made to the General
A&s;&s;embly, who&s;e Determination was to be
Deci&s;ive.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding this Re&s;triction on
Patrons, many Abu&s;es re&s;ulted from the
Patronages by Contracts betwixt the Patrons
and &s;ome Mini&s;ters, who were Guilty of di|lapidating
the Rents of the Benefices (without
regard how their Succe&s;&s;ors &s;hou'd live
after them) for the &s;ake of pre&s;ent Profit.
And by the &s;ame Method, Benefices were
conferr'd upon unqualify'd Per&s;ons, both by
the King and other Lay-Patrons, again&s;t
which a Remedy was provided by the 101&s;t
and 102d Acts of King <HI>James</HI> VIth's 7th
Parliament which met <HI>October</HI> 24. 1581.</P>
<P>A further Remedy was provided by the
116th Act of his 12th Parliament, which
met <HI>June</HI> 5. 1592. by which the Collation and
Deprivation of Mini&s;ters was lodg'd in the
Church, <HI>As a Privilege granted by God to
her Spiritual Office - bearers, wherein her
General A&s;&s;emblies were al&s;o Ratify'd and
Approv'd, with all her Privileges, Liberties,
and Immunities and Freedoms given and
granted by his Highne&s;s, his Regents in
his Name, or any of his Predece&s;&s;ors to the
true and Holy Kirk, pre&s;ently E&s;tabli&s;h'd with|in
this Realm; and among other Privileges,
all Pre&s;entations to Benefices were to be di|rected
<PB N="272" REF="283">
to the Pre&s;byteries, with a full Power
of Collation:</HI> And by the 117th Act, the
Church had a Power of pre&s;enting <HI>Jure De|voluto,</HI>
if the Patron did not pre&s;ent a quali|fy'd
Per&s;on after a Vacancy of &s;ix Months:
But a Re&s;erve being made in the 116th Act,
that they &s;hould receive and admit any qua|lify'd
Per&s;on pre&s;ented by his Maje&s;ty, or Lay-Patrons,
the Abu&s;e continued, and Mini&s;ters
were depriv'd of their Benefices by &s;everal
Patrons, to prevent which, the 169th Act
of King <HI>James</HI> VIth's 13th Parliament was
made.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e Provi&s;ions again&s;t
the Abu&s;e of Patronages, the General A&s;&s;em|bly
of 1596 finding, that by tho&s;e Pre&s;en|tations
many Per&s;ons were forciby thru&s;t
into the Mini&s;try, and upon Congregations,
who&s;e Conduct &s;hew'd they were never call'd
of God, the A&s;&s;embly provided, that none
&s;hou'd &s;eek Pre&s;entations to Benefices, <HI>with|out
Advice of the Pre&s;bytery, in who&s;e Bounds
they lay,</HI> on pain of being repell'd, as <HI>Rei Am|bitus,</HI>
and they de&s;ired, that &s;uch as were
Guilty of dilapidating Benefices, or of di|mitting
them for Favour or Money, &s;o as
they become Lay-Patronages, might be pu|ni&s;h'd
as Dilapidators.</P>
<P>Thus the&s;e Lay <HI>Patronages</HI> continued a
Subject of Controver&s;y betwixt Lay-Patrons
and the Church, and occa&s;ioned many Abu&s;es
and much Clamour by the Courtiers again&s;t

her, but they cou'd not fully accompli&s;h their
De&s;ign, till after the Union of the Crowns,
when the Court being at a di&s;tance from
<HI>Scotland,</HI> and open to the con&s;tant Sollicita|tion
of Men of other Principles, the State of
Bi&s;hops was e&s;tabli&s;h'd in <HI>Scotland,</HI> by the
2d Act of King <HI>James</HI> VIth's 18th Parliam.
which met <HI>July</HI> 9. 1696, after which the
Power of <HI>Pre&s;entation</HI> was lodg'd in the
Archbi&s;hops and Bi&s;hops; but the <HI>Patrons,</HI>
by their Intere&s;t in Parliament, had the Luck
to keep their <HI>Patronages</HI> on Foot under &s;e|veral
Re&s;trictions, which did not remove the
Evil that, from the Beginning, was com|plain'd

inverted the Tythes to their own private
U&s;e, and no Mini&s;ter was Pre&s;ented, till he
had given a Lea&s;e to his <HI>Patron</HI> of the Ty|thes
of his Pari&s;h, in Con&s;ideration of a poor
Aliment to him&s;elf and his Family: An
Abu&s;e which ought certainly to Affect all
tho&s;e who are truly Religious, either in the

Date, it appears that the <HI>Patronages</HI> formerly
belonging to the Bi&s;hops were ve&s;ted in the
<HI>Pre&s;bytertes,</HI> by Act of Parliament, and that
the like Method of the <HI>Pre&s;byteries</HI> &s;ending

as to his Maje&s;ty was al&s;o agreed
upon.</P>
<P>But in the A&s;&s;embly of 1643, they Peti|tioned
his Maje&s;ty, That, con&s;idering the

<HI>Patronages,</HI> being made pur&s;uant to the
above-mention'd Article of the <HI>Claim of Right,</HI>
and for compleating the Settlement men|tion'd
in the &s;aid 5th Act for &s;ettling <HI>Pre&s;by|terian</HI>
Church-Government in the Terms of
it, is very plainly confirm'd by the &s;aid 6th
Act of Her Maje&s;ty's Parliament, 1707,
which is made, and expre&s;ly declar'd to be
a Fundamental and E&s;&s;ential Condition of
the Treaty of Union.</P>
<P>By this Act for aboli&s;hing <HI>Patronages,</HI> no|thing
but the Right of <HI>Pre&s;entation</HI> is taken
from the <HI>Patrons,</HI> in order to &s;ettle the Call
of Mini&s;ters upon the Foot of a Free Apo&s;to|lical
Election, which the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI>
has always contended for, and this the <HI>Pa|trons</HI>
have &s;o little cau&s;e to complain of, that
their <HI>Civil-Right</HI> is put in a better Condition
than befor; for now they have a Right to
<PB N="278" REF="289">
the Tythes, and are in a manner made Ti|tulars;
whereas, &s;o long as they continued
only <HI>Patrons,</HI> they were under a Nece&s;&s;ity
to make Contracts with the Mini&s;ters they
pre&s;ented, about the Right of Tythes, which
now they need not do, &s;ince they them&s;elves
are the Titulars, and the Mini&s;ters only
Stipendaries. This has effectually put a &s;top
to <HI>Simoniacal</HI> Contracts, which have ever been
the Abhorrence of all Chri&s;tian Churches,
and of none more than the Church of <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
from whom, in this Matter, they differ
not in Principle, as may be &s;een in Her 40th
Canon, containing a Oath which all Intrants
are obliged to take at their In&s;titution into
Benefices, <HI>viz. That they have made no</HI> Si|moniacal
<HI>Payment, Contract, or Promi&s;e, di|rectly
or indirectly, by them&s;elves, or by any
Per&s;on or Per&s;ons what&s;oever, for, or con|cerning
the procuring and obtaining of this
Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Dignity, Place, Preferment,
Office, or Living, nor will, at any Time
hereafter, perform, or &s;atisfy any &s;uch kind
of Payment, Contract, or Promi&s;e, made by
any other without their Knowledge and Con|&s;ent.</HI></P>
<P>It mu&s;t be own'd, That this is a very &s;trict
Oath; but we are not to wonder, that the
Church of <HI>England</HI> took &s;uch Precautions in
a Matter of this Importance, &s;ince, in the
Preamble to the Canon, She ju&s;tly &s;ays, <HI>That</HI>
<PB N="279" REF="290">
Simony <HI>is a dete&s;table Sin, and that the Buy|ing
and Selling of Spiritual and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical
Functions, Offices, Promotions, Dignities and
Livings</HI> IS EXECRABLE BEFORE
GOD.</P>
<P>We know 'tis us'd as an Argument for
re&s;toring <HI>Lay-Patronages,</HI> that the Right of
pre&s;enting Mini&s;ters, is a Right of <HI>Property,</HI>
to which the <HI>Patrons</HI> have as good a Title
as to their E&s;tates; and al&s;o, that there was
about 33 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling to be paid to the <HI>Patrons</HI>
for renouncing their Right of Pre&s;entation,
which has never been paid.</P>
<P>Any one may &s;ee, that the&s;e are very &s;light
Pretences to weaken or alter the <HI>Con&s;titution</HI>
of a <HI>Church,</HI> &s;o &s;olemnly e&s;tabli&s;h'd, as a Fun|damental
and Unalterable Article of the
Union. The fair Dealing that is E&s;&s;ential
to the Execution of all Treaties does not ad|mit,
that, upon &s;uch weak Pretences, there
&s;hou'd be the lea&s;t &s;traitning of the Benefit
intended for the Quiet and Satisfaction, as
well as for the Security of the Church of
<HI>Scotland.</HI> No Man, &s;oberly thinking, can
imagine that any one has that &s;ame Proper|ty
in Pre&s;enting Mini&s;ters to Churches, as
they have in their Lands, Hou&s;es, Goods
and Chattels: Be&s;ides, the Patrons of <HI>Scot|land,</HI>
as has been ob&s;erv'd already, have not
the Foundation of <HI>Patronage</HI> required by
the <HI>Canon-Law.</HI> The Churches of <HI>Scotland</HI>
<PB N="280" REF="291">
are not endow'd by the <HI>Patrons,</HI> nor out of
any private E&s;tate; for &s;ince the Reforma|tion,
the State of the Provi&s;ion of Mini&s;ters,
and con&s;equently of the <HI>Patrons</HI> Claims is
very much alter'd. Mini&s;ters have their
Stipends or Allowance for &s;erving the Cures,
out of the Tythes, which as above, is by Law
accounted the <HI>Patrimony of the Church,</HI> and
Churches are appointed to be Built and Re|pair'd
by the Pari&s;hioners. The Ground up|on
which the Churches are built, the Glebes
and Mini&s;ter's Dwelling-Hou&s;es, are by Law
taken out of the Property of the Pari&s;h; &s;o
that it is the Church and Pari&s;h that have
the Title of the <HI>Canon-Law</HI> to the <HI>Patro|nage,</HI>
&s;ince it is the Pari&s;h who gave the <HI>Dos
Aedificatio,</HI> and the <HI>Fundus.</HI></P>
<P>The other Part of the Objection, that the
<HI>Patrons</HI> have not receiv'd the 33 <HI>l.</HI> for Re|&s;igning
their Right of Pre&s;entation can ne|ver
be allow'd as a good Rea&s;on to re&s;tore
that Right; &s;ince the very Act did provide
for a Di&s;tre&s;s and Execution at the Suit of
the <HI>Patrons,</HI> again&s;t the Pari&s;h, if the &s;aid 33 <HI>l.</HI>
was not paid, but if this Execution has not
been made U&s;e of by the <HI>Patrons,</HI> 'tis their
own Fault. Therefore they cannot, in
Ju&s;tice, pretend to have &s;uch a Relief as a
Right to the Pre&s;entation, for that which
has been the Con&s;equence of their own Neg|lect.
But further, it is wrong to pretend,
<PB N="281" REF="292">
that there was no other Price appointed by
the &s;aid Act for the Right of Pre&s;entation,
but the 33 <HI>l.</HI> above-mention'd, &s;ince there is,
certainly, a much more valuable Con&s;idera|tion.
The <HI>Patrons,</HI> who, before that Act,
cou'd have no Right to the Tythes, but by
Simony, which is execrable, and con&s;e|quently
not to be ju&s;tify'd by any Colour of
Law, have, by the very Act which deprives
them of the Right of Pre&s;entation, a Title to
the Tythes with the Burden only of a fair
and hone&s;t Proviion to be &s;ettled by the
Law upon the Mini&s;ters for &s;erving the Cure.
This the <HI>Patrons</HI> do enjoy, and have en|joy'd
for 22 Years, and by Virtue of that
Title the Tythes have been convey'd from
Hand to Hand.</P>
<P>So that tho&s;e who pretend to have <HI>Patro|nages</HI>
re&s;tored, becau&s;e of a Delicacy in Point
of Property would rob the Church of her
Tythes, which is her <HI>Patrimony,</HI> without al|lowing
the Calling and Ordaining of <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI>
to remain as it is now e&s;tabli&s;h'd, agreeable to
the mo&s;t ancient Practice of the Chri&s;tian
Church? They would enjoy the Purcha&s;e
and the Price too?</P>
<P>There might be many u&s;eful Ob&s;erva|tions
made from the&s;e Things; but as
the Bill is in its very <HI>Cri&s;is,</HI> at the Writing
the&s;e Sheets, the Author cannot make &s;uch
Notes on it as might otherwi&s;e be nece&s;&s;ary.
<PB N="282" REF="293">
It is &s;ufficient here, that I have Stated the
Right of the Church <HI>Scotland:</HI> What the
Parliament may do in, or the Church of <HI>Scot|land</HI>
&s;uffer under the Unhappy Circum&s;tance
above-noted, I cannot Determine here, neither
have I room in this narrow Compa&s;s to En|large
upon it.</P>

<P>_THE Ca&s;e of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in

with, and Concern
in the Condition of the
Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> that
however, thro' the Error
of the Times, we have not that Concert
and Under&s;tanding which our Brethren in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> that it were to be wi&s;h'd for
mutual Safety had been maintain'd; yet
it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;eparate them in Hi&s;tory,

or to make ju&s;t Remarks on the State of the
One without taking Notice of the Other. The
&s;ame Party Oppos'd both; the &s;ame Rancor,
Rage, and Per&s;ecuting Malice, po&s;&s;e&s;s'd their
Enemies in both Parts, &amp; with the &s;ame View.
We come now to direct this Tract to the <HI>Di&s;&s;en|ters.</HI>
'Tis a hard Ta&s;k to know how to give
Reproof, but 'tis yet a harder, and one of the
harde&s;t Ta&s;ks in Nature to know how to re|ceive
it. The fir&s;t requires Prudence, and
Di&s;intere&s;ted Faithfulne&s;s; the other Mo|de&s;ty
in a va&s;t Quantiy, Wi&s;dom, Obedience
to Conviction, and a very great Stock of
Temper, Humility, and Self-Denial, <HI>Reprove
one that has Under&s;tanding, and he will Un|der&s;tand,</HI>
Prov. 19. 25. None but a Man of
Under&s;tanding is fit to receive Reproof.</P>
<P><HI>Fools</HI> hate In&s;truction: <HI>Children</HI> could kill
their Schoolma&s;ters; and both abhorr their
<HI>be&s;t Friends;</HI> and we know that Reproof to
a Generation that think them&s;elves &s;o Wife
as this, is a mo&s;t De&s;parate, and almo&s;t Hope|le&s;s
Attempt. But the People concern'd mu&s;t
remember the very Hi&s;tory of their <HI>Conduct</HI>
is a kind of Reproof; and he that will faithful|ly
relate the one, mu&s;t be of cour&s;e concern'd
in the other; for as the Prophet &s;aid of Old,
<HI>Thine own Iniquities reprove thee, and thy
Back&s;lidings condemn thee.</HI></P>
<P>It is not therefore the Author of this that
takes upon him to Remark, or Animadvert
upon the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters;</HI> their own Hi&s;tory repre|hends
their Follies we &s;peak of; and a bare re|lation
<PB N="285" REF="296">
of Fact is a full Reproof to the Parties
concern'd: Perhaps there may lie &s;ome Ob|jections
again&s;t the Manner, and &s;ome may
complain of the Openne&s;s, the Unkindne&s;s,
the plaine&s;s of the Reproof: But this &s;hall be
an&s;wer'd thus; there &s;hall lie no Objection
again&s;t the Inju&s;tice, or Unrea&s;onablene&s;s of
it: Of the Truth of Fact, the Ju&s;tice of the
Con&s;equences, and the Probabilities of the
Mi&s;chiefs here laid down, every Reader is
Judge; and the making it publick is an ap|peal
to the World for the&s;e, and a Challenge
to Gain&s;ayers: But as to the Sea&s;onablene&s;s,
Openne&s;s, Kindne&s;s, Plainne&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Au|thor
thinks it in his own Brea&s;t to judge of
them, and may de&s;cend to Defend them,
when the Debates about the Truth and
Ju&s;tice of them are over.</P>
<P>I pre&s;ume, no <HI>Di&s;&s;enter</HI> that has any ju&s;t
Concern upon his Thoughts for the Intere&s;t

in <HI>England,</HI> will Di&s;pute the Foundation,
<HI>viz.</HI> That they are to be e&s;teem'd, at this
Time, in a declining and decaying Po&s;ture.
And tho' it be a little begging the Que&s;tion,
yet we choo&s;e to appeal to them&s;elves, rather
than enter into the publick Enquiry of the
Particulars, which they ought to take for
the fir&s;t Evidence, that the Author of this is
a Friend to, and really knows their Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>But that it may be under&s;tood, more perfect|ly,
what is meant here by the Words <HI>Decaying</HI>
<PB N="286" REF="297">
and <HI>Declining</HI> of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> the
Reader is de&s;ired to accept of the following
Explication.</P>
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>1. It is not meant, That they are <HI>decay'd
in their Numbers,</HI> or <HI>declin'd</HI> in their
Extent.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Nor is it meant, That they are <HI>decay'd</HI>
in their Quality, Wealth, or Worldly
Circum&s;tances.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. But that the <HI>Decay</HI> and <HI>Declining</HI> of the
<HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> lies in the <HI>Decay</HI> of their <HI>In|tere&s;t;</HI>
their <HI>Friends;</HI> their <HI>Mini&s;try;</HI>
their <HI>General Practice,</HI> whether Reli|gious
or Politick; their <HI>Union</HI> and <HI>Una|nimity</HI>

their <HI>Charity,</HI> largene&s;s of <HI>Spirit,</HI> ta&s;te

and even of their <HI>Morals.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></Q>
<P>This will but too plainly appear in the
following Di&s;cour&s;e: And if laying down
the Matter of Fact, making it &s;elf-evident in

will not open the Eyes of tho&s;e, for
who&s;e Conviction this is written, their Blind|ne&s;s
will not lie at the Door of any-Body
but them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I hope, and believe, that the Principle of
<PB N="287" REF="298">
<HI>Di&s;&s;enting</HI> from the Church of <HI>England</HI> is the
&s;ame as Ever; tho' 'tis manife&s;t this Age
is not able to give &s;o good an Account of it
as the la&s;t; the rea&s;on of which is manife&s;t,
and may be &s;um'd up thus:</P>
<P>The la&s;t Age of <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> was compos'd
of tho&s;e who, upon the Re&s;toration of
the <HI>Church Di&s;cipline,</HI> and the <HI>Act of Uni|formity,
Anno</HI> 1661, found them&s;elves
&s;traightned in their Con&s;ciences, as to <HI>Con|formity,</HI>
with the Ceremonies in Wor&s;hip,
and Hierarchy, or Government of the <HI>Church
of England;</HI> for it is evident, in Doctrine
they do not Di&s;&s;ent. Upon this, after the
Endeavours us'd on both Sides, at the <HI>Savoy</HI>
Conference, (if both Sides did endeavour)
for a Reconciliation, had prov'd fruitle&s;s, all
tho&s;e Mini&s;ters who could not comply with
the Church, were turn'd out of their Li|vings;
and finding many of the People re|&s;olv'd
al&s;o not to conform; the one Part
believing in their Con&s;ciences they ought
not to omit the Preaching the Go&s;pel, <HI>as
they were Mini&s;ters;</HI> the other believing
they ought to wor&s;hip God in that Way
<HI>only</HI> which they thought to be mo&s;t agree|able
to his reveal'd Will, and mo&s;t Edifying
to them&s;elves: And both Con&s;cientiou&s;ly,
and meerly Scrupling the <HI>Church Govern|ment,
Di&s;cipline,</HI> and <HI>Wor&s;hip,</HI> they joyn'd
together, form'd &s;eparate Congregations, and
thus began to be call'd <HI>Di&s;&s;enters.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="299">
How far this Original is ju&s;tifiable, whe|ther
they are thereby become <HI>Schi&s;maticks;</HI>
how they have been treated by, or have be|hav'd
them&s;elves to the Church, is no Part
of the Bu&s;ine&s;s of this Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Their <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> were Men known over
the whole World; their general Character
was own'd even by their Enemies; gene|rally
Speaking, they were Men of liberal
Education; had a va&s;t Stock of Learning;
were Exemplar in Piety; Studious, Labo|rious,
and unexceptionably Capable of Car|rying
on the Work they were embark'd in.
We are Talking to the Reader as a <HI>Di&s;&s;enter</HI>
in this, and therefore need not enter into the
Particular Characters of the Race of Men,
now gone off the Stage, who&s;e Works, <HI>tho'
they are re&s;ted from their Labour,</HI> &s;till fol|low
them; and who, their Enemies being
Judges, were Men worthy of a better Lot
than they met with in this Place. How
near the pre&s;ent Stock, which we are now
furni&s;h'd with, come up to tho&s;e that went
before them, and how qualify'd to &s;upport
and carry on the Cau&s;e, and the Work they
left upon their Hands &s;hall be examin'd in
its Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>As were the Mini&s;ters, &s;o, in a Proportion,
were the People; they were Con&s;cientious,
diligent Hearers of the Word preach'd, &s;tu|dy'd
the be&s;t Gifts, encourag'd, but not
<PB N="289" REF="300">
wor&s;hip'd their Mini&s;ters; they follow'd
the Sub&s;tance, not the Sound of Preaching,
they under&s;tood what they Heard, and knew
how to choo&s;e their Mini&s;ters: What they
heard Preach'd, they improv'd in Practice;
their Families were little Churches, where
the Wor&s;hip of God was con&s;tantly kept
up; their Children and Families were du|ly
In&s;tructed, and them&s;elves, when they
came to Tryal, chearfully &s;uffer'd Per&s;ecu|tion
for the Integrity of their Hearts, ab|horring
to contradict, by their Practice,
what they profe&s;s'd in Principle; or, by any
Hypocritical Compliance, to give the World
Rea&s;on to believe they had not Di&s;&s;ented,
but upon a &s;incerely examin'd and meet
Con&s;cientious Scruple.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e, both Mini&s;ters and People,
there was a joynt Concurrence in carrying
on the Work of Religion; the Fir&s;t preach'd
found Doctrine without Jingle or Trifling;
they Study'd what they Deliver'd; they
preach'd their Sermons, rather than read
them in the Pulpit; they &s;poke from the
Heart to the Heart, nothing like our cold
Declaiming Way, entertain'd now as a Mode,
and read with a Flouri&s;h, under the ridicu|lous
Notion of being Methodical; but what
they conceiv'd by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the
Great In&s;pirer of his Servants, <HI>the Holy Spi|rit,</HI>
they deliver'd with a becoming Gravity,
a decent Fervour, an affectionate Zeal, and
<PB N="290" REF="301">
a Mini&s;terial Authority, &s;uited to the Dig|nity
of the Office, and the Maje&s;ty of the
Work; and as a Te&s;timony of this their
practical Works, left behind them, are a living
<HI>Specimen</HI> of what they perform'd among us:
Such are the large Volumes of Divinity re|maining
of Dr <HI>Goodwin,</HI> Dr. <HI>Manton,</HI> Dr.
<HI>Owen,</HI> Dr. <HI>Bates,</HI> Mr. <HI>Charnock,</HI> Mr. <HI>Pool,</HI>
Mr. <HI>Clark&s;on,</HI> Mr. <HI>Baxter,</HI> Mr. <HI>Flavell,</HI> Mr.
<HI>How,</HI> and others, too many to mention.</P>
<P>It will be a &s;ad Te&s;timony of the decli|ning
State of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> to
examine the Race of Mini&s;ters that fill'd
up the Places of tho&s;e gone before; but more
e&s;pecially the Stock Springing up to &s;ucceed
tho&s;e now employ'd; and to compare them
with tho&s;e gone off the Stage. It is not the
De&s;ign of this Work to make Per&s;onal Re|flections,
or Invidious Compari&s;ons; as few as
po&s;&s;ible &s;hall be pointed out. The Mini&s;ters,
now Serving you, are too mode&s;t not to own
the Fact; the Young ones Introducing, too
Ignorant to have their Opinion valu'd, tho'
they &s;hould Oppo&s;e it; and that Pride which
leads them to think otherwi&s;e, is the very
Ignorance and Defect we complain of.</P>
<P>To avoid entring into the odious Parti|culars
more than is needful, to make out
what is alleged, it may be proper to examin
the Rea&s;on of the Difference between the
Mini&s;ters of this Age and the la&s;t; and if it
appears, that the Decay is a nece&s;&s;ary Con|&s;equence
<PB N="291" REF="302">
of the pre&s;ent Management of Af|fairs
among the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters;</HI> and that it real|ly
can be no otherwi&s;e, there will be le&s;s
need of dipping into Characters.</P>
<P>Three Things in the Management of the
<HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> relating to their Mini&s;ters, makes
it impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould come up to the
Pitch of the la&s;t Age; and will make a far|ther
Decay infallibly the Con&s;equence, if
they do not, in time, think of &s;ome Method
to correct the Mi&s;take, re&s;train the Spread|ing
of the Mi&s;chief, and bring Learning and
Preaching more in U&s;e among them than it
&s;eems to be at pre&s;ent: The&s;e are,
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Manner of &s;upplying the <HI>Di&s;&s;en|ters</HI>
with Mini&s;ters.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Manner of managing them, when
they come to Preach.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The Ta&s;te of the Hearers of what they
Preach.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q></P>
<P>If all the&s;e are alter'd from what they
formerly were, and that &s;o much as to make
a Decay of the Mini&s;try unavoidable, then
there will want very little A&s;&s;i&s;tance to prove,
that there is &s;uch a Decay, or that this De|cay
tends to the Ruin of the Di&s;&s;enting Inte|re&s;t:
The Author of this, de&s;igning it only

<P>But in order to the Plainne&s;s and Bre|vity
de&s;ign'd, and to come directly to the
Point, we de&s;ire you, the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters in and
about</HI> London <HI>e&s;pecially,</HI> to examine, &s;eriou&s;ly,
whether the following Account of the Sup|plies
of Mini&s;ters
be Matter of Fact or no;
if you find <HI>it is not,</HI> every Hone&s;t Man will
be Contented, and glad to &s;ee it Contradicted
and Di&s;approv'd, and <HI>if it be,</HI> they will be
much more glad to &s;ee you &s;et heartily about
&s;ome Method to reform it, and to re&s;tore,
if po&s;&s;ible, a Painful, Learned, Judicious, and
Pious Mini&s;try to the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> which alone
can prevent the De&s;truction of their Intere&s;t,
and the Return of their Po&s;terity to the
Church, from whence we think we had
good Rea&s;on to withdraw.</P>
<P>The Supply of Mini&s;ters is to be under|&s;tood
Twofold; i. By Educating and Bring|ing
up Youth to the Work: And 2. By
Calling, Removing, or Tran&s;planting Mi|ni&s;ters
already brought up from one Place
to another. The Fir&s;t re&s;pects the whole
Body of <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in <HI>England.</HI> The Se|cond
chiefly re&s;pects <HI>London,</HI> and the other
Capital Cities or Towns where the Congre|gations
are wealthy and large.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="304">
To begin with the Education of Mini&s;ters.
It is true, and it is not lay'd as a Blame up|on
the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> that they being a Body of
People under what we may call <HI>Per&s;ecuted
Circum&s;tances,</HI> Tolerated, indeed, by the hap|py
Conjunction of <HI>Circum&s;tances</HI> in the Go|vernment
they live under, but under narrow
contracted limits of the Law, and a Jealou&s;y
of their having rather too much than too
little Liberty, have not the Encouragement
of Preferments, Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Honours, and
Advantages, or large Stipends and Benefices
to rai&s;e their Mini&s;ters to, and thereby to
prompt them to hard and laborious Study,
and to the nece&s;&s;ary Qualifications that are
requi&s;ite in this Ca&s;e. On the contrary,
the Utmo&s;t they have before them, when
they &s;et out, is a de&s;pis'd and ejected Condi|tion;
to be Mock'd, Contemn'd, and Mal|treated
by the Times, and to be &s;ure never
to ri&s;e Higher than a meer Pari&s;h Prie&s;t.
A Mini&s;ter of a private Congregation lies
under many Di&s;advantages which the <HI>Church</HI>
Men are free from; he frequently, and gene|rally
lives an entire dependent upon the
Benevolence of his Hearers, to whom he is, by
that Means, in a Manner wholly &s;ubjected
and liable always to their Peicks, Di&s;|gu&s;ts,
and Cavils, whether rea&s;onable or
unrea&s;onable; nay, &s;ometimes to their Slan|ders
and Reproach, by which he is expos'd
to be bla&s;ted by their Breath, and, if Injur'd
<PB N="294" REF="305">
has no Remedy left him as a Mini&s;ter, nay,
le&s;s than another Man in many Re&s;pects.
This is attended with &s;uch Con&s;equences
as the&s;e:</P>
<P>1. That few of tho&s;e who have any
Thing to give their Children, or at lea&s;t
any Thing con&s;iderable, can entertain the
Thought of Breeding them up to &s;o Di&s;pi&s;ed
a State as that of the Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>2. That of tho&s;e that are brought up to it,
if any great E&s;tate or Honour befalls them,
either by De&s;cent, or Accident, they &s;oon
grow weary of the contemptible Employ|ment,
and lay By their Books.</P>
<P>3. That if any Temptation of Advance|ment
offers them, they are the &s;ooner
brought off to comply and change their
Party. Tho' it is not to be doubted but, that
Want of a Foundation in Principle, and a
Stock of Learning to &s;upport it, has been a
greater Occa&s;ion of a Defection than the
Temptation of Money; of which by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>To de&s;cend then to the Manner of Bring|ing
up our Young Mini&s;ters among the
<HI>Di&s;&s;enters:</HI> It is evident that at this Time,
<HI>and for &s;ome Tears pa&s;t,</HI> the Mini&s;ters of
the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> are, <HI>generally Speaking,</HI> bread
up upon Charity. This Charity is, either
when any particular Per&s;on or Congrega|tion
has taken up a Youth &s;ome Way or
other related to them, (and generally for
the &s;ake of their Parent) and has been at the
<PB N="295" REF="306" MS="Y">
Charge of their Education; or by what they
call the <HI>Fund:</HI> This <HI>Fund</HI> is a certain Sum
of Money partly collected, either Annually
or Quarterly, at the <HI>Meeting-Hou&s;e</HI> Doors,
prompted by the earne&s;t Exhortation of the
Mini&s;ters, and partly obtain'd by Gifts of
well-di&s;pos'd Per&s;ons, &s;ome by Yearly Al|lowance
in their Lives, and others by Le|gacies
at their Death.</P>
<P>There is not the lea&s;t De&s;ign to object
here again&s;t the faithful Di&s;po&s;ition of the
Money &s;o collected, or the Care of the Mi|ni&s;ters
to whom it is generally entru&s;ted in
Applying it. The Schools that have been
erected; the Methods taken for In&s;tructing
Youth; the Learning they get there, are no
Part of the Complaints here made: The Ma|&s;ters,
no que&s;tion, do their be&s;t to train up, and
in&s;truct the Youth committed to them; all
the Complaints I have met with of that kind,
&s;eem to me either very trivial, or ill prov'd, and
very well an&s;wer'd by Mr. <HI>Sam. Palmer,</HI> (tho'
&s;ince he has chang'd his Noat,) in his Reply
to Mr. <HI>Samuel We&s;tly's</HI> Letter and Defence.</P>
<P>But the Thing is impo&s;&s;ible in its own
Nature, the Di&s;advantages of private Acade|mies,
being without Publick Libraries, with|out
Polite Conver&s;ation, without Suited Au|thority,
with Cla&s;&s;es to check and examin
one another, and, above all, without Time
given to fini&s;h the Youth in the Studies they
apply to, are unavoidable. The Education to
<PB N="296" REF="307">
be had there, is on the&s;e and &s;everal other
&s;uch as can by no Means an&s;wer the End,
or ever bring Mankind up to the pitch of
Greatne&s;s that the former Age was arriv'd
to: Here and there one, a Youth ble&s;s'd
with an extraordinary Genius, &s;trong Parts,
and great Application, may Out-&s;trip Others;
and the&s;e, under all the Di&s;couragements and
Difficulties above, may ri&s;e to a Pitch beyond
the common Rate: But, like <HI>David's</HI> Second
Rate Worthies, they may be great; howbeit
they do not come up to the Rate of the Fir&s;t?</P>
<P><HI>Here,</HI> by the Way, <HI>is to be noted the Ig|norance
and Blindne&s;s of the</HI> Di&s;&s;enters <HI>Ene|mies,
in their exclaiming again&s;t their Schools
and Accademies; and endeavouring to pull
them down:</HI> Whereas, <HI>If they would pull the</HI>
Di&s;&s;enters <HI>down, their only way to do it, is to
let their Accademies &s;tand; but to pull their
Accademies down, is only the way to force them
to &s;end their youth to fitter Places.</HI> This is
evident in the fir&s;t Years after the Expul&s;ion
of Mini&s;ters, before the private Accademies
were erected; and when their Mini&s;ters were
generally Educated Abroad, from whence
they came much better fini&s;h'd, than they
do now, from our private Accademies; and
this makes the pre&s;ent Set of Mini&s;ters, that
are al&s;o wearing off the Stage, de&s;erve this
Character, <HI>That tho' they do not come up to the
fir&s;t number of Worthies,</HI> of whom mention
is made, <HI>yet they go far beyond any that we
&s;ee like to come after them.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="308">
But to go back from the Schools to the
Schollars; let us examin, a little, the Circum|&s;tances
of the Youth, and, if po&s;&s;ible, come at
the Ground of the Defect; and a fair Appeal
is made to the Age for the Truth of the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>A poor Widow is left De&s;titute, and a true
Object of Pity; her Hu&s;band was a Member
of &s;uch or &s;uch a Congregation; was, per|haps,
a Benefactor while he liv'd; a Good
Man, Well-belov'd, and de&s;erv'd it: The
Woman is the &s;ame; &s;he is now De&s;olate,
has a Hou&s;e full of Children, and no Provi|&s;ion
made for them; wherefore, not know|ing
how to provide for them otherwi&s;e, &s;he
is willing to Dedicate One or Two of them
to the Service of God. <HI>By the way,</HI> it is too
unhappy a Truth, tho' a &s;evere Sarca&s;m on
the Per&s;ons, that <HI>God,</HI> or <HI>his Cau&s;e,</HI> &s;hould
have little of their Help, if they could live
without it; and the Rea&s;on is given before;
but being in this Condition, the Widow
afore&s;aid, makes Friends to her Mini&s;ter to
get her Son into <HI>the Fund;</HI> &s;o the Bank or
<HI>Charity-Money,</HI> for Education of Mini&s;ters,
<HI>as before</HI> is publickly call'd. The Congre|gation
in Re&s;pect to the Memory of the Fa|ther,
and in Compa&s;&s;ion to the Widow, join
in the Propo&s;al, and agree to take the Chil|dren
off her Hands; and all the&s;e are very
good Principles in their kind. But as this re|lates
to a Mini&s;ter of God's Word, <HI>I conceive</HI>
the Ca&s;e alters; and many Things joyn to
<PB N="298" REF="309">
make this Practice very De&s;tructive to the
<HI>Di&s;&s;enters.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Here is not a Word of Enquiry made
into the Genius, the Capacity, or the Inclina|tion
of the Child, or Children. <HI>The Ca&s;e is
not</HI> what they are fit for, but they mu&s;t not be
Starved; the poor Woman mu&s;t be reliev'd,
perhaps the Boy is a Native Blockhead: <HI>If
any &s;uch Thing be:</HI> Perhaps he is of a Fiery
Temper, all Volatile, and not at all fit for the
Work; perhaps he has had a Defect in his
Speech, Stammers and He&s;itates, and cannot
expre&s;s him&s;elf; perhaps Purblind, Squint-Eyed,
Near-&s;ighted, or the like, yet he mu&s;t be
a Mini&s;ter, <HI>the Rea&s;on is in the Mother, not
in the Boy.</HI> From hence the Work of God,
the <HI>Sacred Harve&s;t</HI> is Labour'd, and Dre&s;s'd
by the Lame and the Halt; and he that
would not, in Times pa&s;t, admit any Prie&s;t
to &s;erve at his Altar, that had any Blemi&s;h,
or Natural Defect, is now &s;erv'd with <HI>Stam|merers,
Squint-Ey'd, Deaf,</HI> and almo&s;t <HI>Dumb
Preachers.</HI> What Natural Defects do we &s;ee
in the Pulpit, be&s;ides tho&s;e of <HI>Memory,</HI>
of <HI>Application,</HI> of <HI>Morals,</HI> and of <HI>Learning?</HI>
This I take to be the mo&s;t Prepo&s;terous of all,
and is an Error can never be an&s;wer'd but
by being Reformed; 'tis no doubt, the proper
Duty of Parents, and in this Ca&s;e of the <HI>Mi|ni&s;ters,</HI>
al&s;o to whom this Charge is committed,
to &s;tudy the Capacities, the Temper, the In|clination,
and the Common Gifts of their
<PB N="299" REF="310">
Children, in their de&s;igning them for Em|ployment
in the World; and a Child that has
an Imperfection in his Speech, &s;hould no
more be put to be a <HI>Mini&s;ter,</HI> or a <HI>Lawyer,</HI>
than they &s;hould put a <HI>Cripple</HI> to be a <HI>Dan|cing-Ma&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>Nor is this Injurious only to the Mini&s;try,
and to the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in general,
but it is Injurious to the Children them&s;elves
in particular: Will &s;uch be able to do the
Work they are bred to? Will they ever come
to any Thing? Will they get their Bread?
It were much better they were made <HI>Porters,</HI>
Grooms, or any lawful Mechanick; that way
they might get their Livings; but the other
is to breed them up as if on purpo&s;e to be di|&s;pis'd
Beggars, and Starve. One blam'd a young
Man of my Acquaintance, that had been bred
a Mini&s;ter, for leaving off his Book when a
good E&s;tate befell him; and for turning Gen|tleman
when he was &s;et apart to the &s;acred
Employment of a Mini&s;ter. His An&s;wer was
Witty, yet Grave; Cour&s;e to him&s;elf, yet &startq;In|genuous:
<HI>When my Father was Poor, he
made me a Mini&s;ter; as it was, he was
wrong, and &s;poiled a good Porter, for I was
never fit for it: When my Father grew Rich,
he told me, if I could make a Mini&s;ter I &s;hould
be never the wor&s;e to make a Gentleman: I
have Learning enough for a Long-Wig, tho'
I had not for a Band: Now I can Talk and
be heard; but if I had Preach'd I had been
good for nothing.&endq;</HI></P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="311">
The Neglect of examining into the Chil|dren
thus put out, is the Cau&s;e why, as
before, &s;ome <HI>Purblind,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Stammering,</HI>
&s;ome <HI>He&s;itating</HI> in Speech, &s;ome <HI>Hair-Lips,</HI>
&s;ome without <HI>Palates,</HI> and others without
<HI>Brains,</HI> are &s;ent to the Schools to make Mini|&s;ters.
Never wonder if the very Di&s;courage|ments
that ari&s;e from &s;uch Natural Defects
make the&s;e come out again Unfini&s;h'd: It is
too Ungrateful a Subject to enter far into the
Con&s;equences of the&s;e Things: But it mu&s;t
have &s;omething &s;aid to it: The Natural In|firmities
above are vi&s;ible, and I believe no
Man will excu&s;e the Error: It is mention'd
&s;eriou&s;ly, here to recommend it to the <HI>Di&s;|&s;enters,</HI>
for a Remedy, they know the Truth
of it too well, the Evil is avoided by the
lea&s;t In&s;pection imaginable.</P>
<P>But come we next to that Defect, we call
<HI>want of Brains;</HI> this is harder to be di&s;co|ver'd,
and the more, becau&s;e we are not wil|ling
to di&s;cover it: Affection in the Parents,
and Charity in the Mini&s;ters; one can not,
and the other care not to &s;ee the Child is a
Fool; but it &s;eems le&s;s excu&s;able in the Ma|&s;ters,
they may &s;ee it, they can &s;ee it, and
they ought to &s;ee it.</P>
<P>If the Boy be a Clod, a meer Stupid, a
Block without a Head, or if he be a Flutter,
a meer Feather, the one too hard, the other
too &s;oft; one too thick, and the other too thin
for a Stock of Learning; one &s;o contracted in
<PB N="301" REF="312">
the Head there is no room to hold it, the
other &s;o thin there's no Power to retain it,
to what Purpo&s;e &s;hould Schoolma&s;ters go
to invert Nature, and force the Current?
Give a Blockhead Learning, you make him
a wor&s;e kind of Blockhead than he was be|fore.
Give a Fool Learning, you make
him a <HI>Rake, a Fop,</HI> and at la&s;t quite a <HI>Lu|natick.</HI>
Letters, like fine Cloaths, let them
be never &s;o well made, &s;o gay, or &s;o rich,
they will never make the Man Genteel,
if he has no Shapes: <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Art</HI> joyn'd,
make an exqui&s;ite and accompli&s;h'd Piece,
<HI>take it in what you will;</HI> nay, <HI>Nature</HI> may
go far without <HI>Art,</HI> but <HI>Art</HI> without <HI>Nature</HI>
is a <HI>Rider</HI> without a <HI>Hor&s;e,</HI> a <HI>Bullet</HI> with|out
a <HI>Gun,</HI> an <HI>Arrow</HI> without a <HI>Bow,</HI> a <HI>Male</HI>
without a <HI>Female,</HI> perfectly U&s;ele&s;s, Impo|tent,
and uncapable to produce any Thing.</P>
<P><HI>Yet this is not all;</HI> but &s;uppo&s;e the Boy
now accepted by the Fund, put to the School,
and abate all the <HI>Defects</HI> above; allow him
to be tolerably Capable, Diligent, Sober,
Moral, <HI>and the like:</HI> Well; <HI>he comes to the
Accademy,</HI> there he reads his <HI>Logicks, Ethicks,
Pneumaticks,</HI> &amp;c. on he goes, looks a little
into <HI>Philo&s;ophy,</HI> and at la&s;t to his <HI>Divinity;</HI>
perhaps he takes a Proportion of all the&s;e,
and by this Time he begins to write <HI>Man,</HI>
look Abroad in the World, gets a Black Coat
and a Band, and behaves well; as &s;oon as
he appears any Thing like, the <HI>Directors</HI> of
<PB N="302" REF="313">
this <HI>Charity</HI> begin to think of Removing
him, that he has Learning enough to be &s;een
Abroad, and they prompt him to Preach;
he has declaim'd a little in the Schools, he
has his <HI>A, B, C,</HI> of <HI>Theologicks,</HI> with &s;ome
Study he can prepare a formal Theme, &s;et a
Text on the Top of it, and, when it is written
down, can read it in a Pulpit; and this he
calls <HI>Preaching!</HI> Then he is a Mini&s;ter, he
has no more Bu&s;ine&s;s at the Schools. And
thus, as he was ha&s;tily put in, &s;o he is ha&s;ti|ly
thru&s;t out, to make room for &s;ome other
of equal Capacity and Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Well; now we find him Abroad, poor
Gentleman! his Circum&s;tances are hard; his
Mother, in&s;tead of being able to keep him, is,
perhaps, by this Time grown Old, and ex|pects
he &s;hould keep her, or at lea&s;t &s;ome
of his Younger Si&s;ters: He is &s;o far from
having Money to buy Books, that he wants
Money to buy Bread; he has no Time to
&s;tay at Home to &s;tudy, for he mu&s;t go A|broad
to get a Dinner.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Thing the unhappy Creature
has to do, is to make his Acquaintance among
the Mini&s;ters; in Order to this, he goes
every <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> to <HI>Salters-Hall,</HI> from thence
he waits upon them to <HI>Hamlin's Coffee-Hou&s;e,</HI>
where he fits at the Feet of <HI>Gamaliel</HI>
and, unle&s;s &s;ome better Chance offers, he
Dines upon a Di&s;h of <HI>Coffee,</HI> while others go
to Dinner where Invitation directs.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="314">
Having thus brought him Abroad, his
Work is to ply in his Habit, as the Labourer,
or the Porter with the Knot and the Ticket at
the Corner of the Streets. Here, if any Mi|ni&s;ter
is Sick, or wants to go into the Coun|try,
or upon any Occa&s;ion cannot preach, he
may be &s;upply'd at the &s;horte&s;t Warning,
for the Young Men have their Tools always
about them, <HI>viz.</HI> a <HI>Pocket-Bible,</HI> and a Set of
<HI>Sermons</HI> ready written, which they Preach
(Read) over in Cour&s;e, and then begin again,
and &s;o a few of the fir&s;t Week's Study &s;erves
them for &s;everal Years. The Truth of which
is &s;o plain and &s;elf-evident, that it needs no
farther Enquiry: But it calls for Lamenta|tion,
and immediate Redre&s;s, if we expect the
Intere&s;t of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> &s;hou'd be &s;upported.</P>
<P>The Application with which the&s;e poor
de&s;picable Things, follow this Part of the
Work, is an undeniable Te&s;timony of their
nece&s;&s;itous <HI>Circum&s;tances.</HI> The Place is a
Proof of the <HI>Fact,</HI> there they are to be &s;een
Daily Plying for a Pulpit, that they may get
Ten Shillings to live upon; and &s;o much are
they to be pity'd, &s;o much do many of them
de&s;erve a better Fate, that this Di&s;cour&s;e is
made really in Compan&s;&s;ion to them, and, if
po&s;&s;ible, to recommend it to a Remedy, not
really to expo&s;e them. Then, as to the Ad|vantage
made this Way, many do not meet
with a favourable Hit once a Month, and,
after the mo&s;t diligent Attendance, are oblig'd
<PB N="304" REF="315">
to live on the la&s;t happy Relief till they
come to the utmo&s;t Extremity.</P>

of the&s;e Gentlemen; &s;ome of them
perform to Admiration, con&s;idering the Cir|cum&s;tances;
and 'tis le&s;t to the Judgment of
all tho&s;e that know what is requi&s;ite to fini&s;h
and compleat a Man of Learning, how long
Time ought, in Rea&s;on, to be allow'd to &s;et a

to determine, if it can be po&s;&s;ible they
&s;hould be good for much as they are equipp'd.</P>
<P>And are the&s;e the Mea&s;ures the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI>
take to &s;upply their Mini&s;try? Is this Me|thod
likely to produce a Succe&s;&s;ion fit to fol|low,
and to fini&s;h the Work begun by the

Dr. <HI>Manton,</HI> Mr. <HI>Charnock,</HI> Mr. <HI>Clark&s;on,</HI> &amp;c.
brought up with &s;uch a Froth of Letters, as
this? Did they get their <HI>Theologicks,</HI> and
<HI>Metaphy&s;icks</HI> in a Year or Two's Reading?
Were they furni&s;h'd with a Body of Divinity,
&s;uitable to the Work they did, and the Proofs
they have left behind them, in being Three
Years at an Accademy?</P>
<P>After the long Expectation, and Mi&s;erable
Porter-like waiting Above, it is now and then
tha Fate of one of the&s;e Gentlemen to get
&s;ome Charge, to get into &s;ome Sub&s;i&s;tence?</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Step, is generally to joyn Three

of the Hearers as an Alms: Were it a Sub|&s;cription

the Help of Others to flouri&s;h on their Ca|pacity
and Undertaking, and, perhaps, with|out
much Merit, to per&s;wade the People to
Contribute: How Scandalous? How Mean?
And how does it Eclip&s;e the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> nay,
even the Preaching of the Go&s;pel.</P>

is one of the mo&s;t &s;olemn Things which
their Church Judicatories exerci&s;e their Au|thority
about, and is never done Judicially;
but where <HI>evident Utility</HI> is the Great and
Only Con&s;ideration; And in this Ca&s;e it is
very frequent to remove a Mini&s;ter from a
large Stipend, a plea&s;ant Dwelling, advanta|geou&s;ly
Seated near to the Capital, or perhaps
in a Great Town, to a le&s;s Stipend, in Bar|ren
Mountains, and the remote&s;t Corners of
<PB N="306" REF="317">
the Nation: In this Ca&s;e the <HI>Mini&s;ter,</HI> con|tented
to be &s;acrific'd for the Good of the
whole Body, chearfully for&s;ake their com|fortable
Dwellings and &s;ufficient Mainte|nance
to comply with it, te&s;tifying, that
they do not expect their Reward on Earth,
or follow <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> for the Loaves and the
Fi&s;hes.</P>
<P>But to examine our Removing of <HI>Mini|&s;ters,</HI>
would be to confe&s;s the Methods and
Motions, are ju&s;t contrary; 1. The City of
<HI>London,</HI> which, <HI>without Reflecting in the
lea&s;t upon &s;ome of the Mini&s;ters, eminent in
their Practi&s;e and Capacities,</HI> is (taking one
with another, and Judging in Proportion)
much wor&s;e &s;upply'd with <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> than
the Country: The Rea&s;ons of which may
be examin'd hereafter. 2. SOME of the
be&s;t <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> the City now have, are &s;uch
as they have, by a Sort of Importunate Vio|lence,
ravi&s;h'd the Country of, and drawn
from the remote&s;t Parts; whether Injuri|ou&s;ly,
or by the Con&s;ent of the People
there, may al&s;o, in Time, come to be enquire'd;
and mo&s;t of the&s;e are, truly, Great Men:
But it &s;eems very unhappy, that of all the
Gentlemen Educated, in or near <HI>London,</HI> by
the Funds, <HI>&amp;c. as above,</HI> there are very
few of whom it would not be call'd <HI>Flat|tery</HI>
to name them among tho&s;e we call
Eminent, except for &s;omething better left
out than mention'd</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="318">
This Method of Calling <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> out of
the Country has hitherto been practis'd in
&s;uch a Magi&s;terial Way, and &s;uch a Sort of
a po&s;itive Sending for them, as if they were
not to be deny'd. It has been founded upon
a Pre&s;umption, That the Living at <HI>London,</HI>
the Reputation of being call'd thither, and
the Encrea&s;e of Stipend or Maintenance, are
Arguments &s;uffcient to command a <HI>Mini&s;ter;</HI>
or at lea&s;t are &s;o equivalent to a Command,
that they are not to be re&s;i&s;ted: And two
Things are e&s;pecially prov'd by this; 1.
All that is &s;aid before of the In&s;uffciency
of our <HI>London</HI> Education, and the Country
being better &s;upply'd is acknowledg'd, &s;ince,
no &s;ooner is any con&s;iderable Place vacant in
<HI>London,</HI> but the Country is plunder'd to &s;up|ply
the Want; while, at the &s;ame Time, the
<HI>Fund-Bred</HI> Creatures, about <HI>London,</HI> lie Star|ving
and Plying as before. 2. That neither
Ju&s;tice to their <HI>Brethren,</HI> Re&s;pect to their <HI>Mini|&s;terial
Obligation,</HI> between Pa&s;tor and People,
much le&s;s Concern for the Publick Intere&s;t of
<HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> or the Capacity of Doing Good
&s;eems to be regarded in the People Calling.</P>
<P>We have, indeed, &s;ome In&s;tances of the
Con&s;cientious Regard &s;ome <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> have
had to the relation between them and their
Congregations, and their Sen&s;e of their be|ing
mo&s;t u&s;eful to God's Church, preferring
it to their being mo&s;t u&s;eful to their own
Families, and accordingly of their Rejecting
<PB N="308" REF="319">
the greate&s;t Offers made to them of Remo|ving
them from their little Retirements in
Remote Parts, in Order to being made Rich,
Ea&s;y, and Popular, either in <HI>London</HI> or
el&s;ewhere: Such as the&s;e were Mr. <HI>James
Owen, of Shre&s;bury,</HI> Mr. <HI>Wood, of $tall,</HI> near
<HI>Berwick,</HI> and others. I wi&s;h I could have
&s;aid the like of an Eminent and mo&s;t U&s;e|ful
<HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> lately Borrow'd, <HI>I had almo&s;t
&s;aid Stolen,</HI> from a remote Part of <HI>England,</HI>
from a Place where we all know he was
mo&s;t e&s;pecially u&s;eful, from a Place that
cannot want him, where the Lo&s;s of him
will never be repair'd, and where the Inte|re&s;t
of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> is in great Danger of
Breaking for Want of him; where the
Wound made by Removing him will not
ea&s;ly, if ever, be repair'd and this to be
brought to <HI>London;</HI> where, without Breach
of Charity, it may be &s;aid he cannot be
equally u&s;eful to others, (whatever he may
be to him&s;elf) as he was before. I will not
go about to &s;ay or &s;ugge&s;t that either the
Pomp of the World, the Fame of being
known, or the Honour of having a Name
&s;pread, could be any Motive to him to come;
but &s;ure the People mu&s;t have a mean Opi|nion
of that <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> to &s;uppo&s;e tho&s;e Things
would tempt him: The Merit of that Gen|tleman
is Eminent for that unfa&s;hionable
Particular, <HI>viz.</HI> That he has always &s;ought
more to excell than to be talk'd of, more the
<PB N="309" REF="320">
Service than the Fame, and this has built
him a real Fame which &s;hall never decay;
it is known that with Reluctance he yielded
to the Importunities of tho&s;e who invited
him hither; but the Reluctance with which
his People parted with him is not to be ex|pre&s;s'd,
any more than the Injury done to
the <HI>Di&s;&s;enting Intere&s;t</HI> in that Part of the
I&s;land, which it is no Arrogance to &s;ay no
Man is better, and few are &s;o well able to
&s;upport. The People who have him, and
think he is their Ble&s;&s;ing here, had need
think well of making a mighty Improvement
under his <HI>Mini&s;try,</HI> le&s;t they have to an&s;wer
for their Sterillity under &s;o great an Oppe|ration,
and for the Robbing tho&s;e of him
that would have turn'd his Labours with
them to a much better Account.</P>
<P>But, to de&s;cend from the Religious Part,
it is &s;trange to me to ob&s;erve the Ju&s;tice of
this Matter, not &s;o much referring to the
pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, as to &s;tate from it both the
Evil of the Practice, and the Injury done
by it to them&s;elves; and therefore, without
making <HI>Panegyricks</HI> on the Chri&s;tian Con|duct
of tho&s;e <HI>Mini&s;ters,</HI> who have cho&s;en ra|ther
to continue in their private Conditions,
in meer Zeal to their Work, Affection to
their People, and Sen&s;e of their Duty, who&s;e
Prai&s;e is of God, and their Reward in Eter|nity,
let the Wi&s;dom, the Integrity, the
Chri&s;tianity, and the Hone&s;ty of the People
<PB N="310" REF="321">
thus Calling them, bear a little Reflection,
What have the <HI>London Di&s;&s;enters</HI> to Offer
in Ju&s;tification of their Calling <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> from
their re&s;petive Charges in the Country, in
the Manner they now practi&s;e it, or to make
their Calling them thus, con&s;i&s;tent with Reli|gion
or common Ju&s;tice? All the Arguments
we yet find made U&s;e of, I mean on the Side
of tho&s;e who call them, Con&s;i&s;t in the
Advance of Sallary, or Stipend, Popularity,
and the Ea&s;e and Advantages of Living here:
The&s;e are of a Kind &s;o ba&s;e, that I will not
&s;ugge&s;t they are of the lea&s;t Weight with a
<HI>Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel,</HI> who&s;e Heart is in his
Work; to whom U&s;efulne&s;s to Souls, and
Propagating the Knowledge of God, and
the Kingdom of our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t ought
to be,</HI> and I hope is among mo&s;t of the <HI>Di&s;|&s;enting
Mini&s;ters,</HI> not the &s;upreme View alone,
but the only View they re&s;pect in the Plant|ing
or Scituating them&s;elves in the World.</P>
<P>This Mammon of Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s we
find happily rejected on many Occa&s;ions, yet
it is not without too frequent Succe&s;s; but at
be&s;t the Principle by which it is offer'd is
Scandalous in all; as if Coveting our Neigh|bour's
Wife or our Neighbour's Mini&s;ter
were not equally forbidden in the Tenth
Commandment, in which we acknowledge
we are forbidden all Inordinate Motions to
any Thing that is our Neighbour's. Vide
<HI>Al&s;emb. Chatech, Pa.</HI> 16.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="322" MS="Y">
In this fatal Way of bringing the Country
<HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> from their Charge, or Congrega|tions,
&s;uch a Variety of Irregular Practi&s;es
follow, that I hardly know where to begin.
How they rather &s;end for them up than in|vite
them, pre&s;uming on the Force of their
meaner Argument, <HI>viz.</HI> Intere&s;t, as before;
how they &s;atisfy them&s;elves with the Know|ledge
of the Per&s;on upon Out-&s;ides, and that
wor&s;t Giver of Characters, <HI>Common Fame;</HI>
oftentimes not De&s;cending to a more parti|cular
Ta&s;te of his Ability; perhaps the Per|&s;on
is of unque&s;tion'd Capacity, of a &s;uperi|our
Character, and of a Merit not to admit
any Debate, as in the late eminent In&s;tance;
yet the be&s;t <HI>Mini&s;ter,</HI> the late <HI>Preacher,</HI> the
be&s;t <HI>Commentator</HI> may not be &s;o particularly
&s;uited to the Ta&s;te or Acceptance of this or
that particular People as another; and in
this Variety con&s;i&s;ts much Advantage to
both <HI>Mini&s;ter and People;</HI> whereas without
it, few Congregations could be &s;erv'd to their
Satisfaction, and &s;ometimes many <HI>Churches</HI>
would cla&s;h for the &s;ame <HI>Mini&s;ter;</HI> and it
&s;eems a Token of very much Indifference to
choo&s;e a Man by Report, and like him be|cau&s;e
other Men lik'd him. <HI>Then as to the
Ju&s;tice of it in the next Place.</HI></P>
<P>Let us a&s;k what Enquiry has been made in
&s;uch Ca&s;es, whether or no his People were
willing to part with him, Robbing a Congre|gation,
nay, perhaps a whole County of a
<HI>Mini&s;ter,</HI> not only exceedingly u&s;eful among
<PB N="312" REF="323">
them, but belov'd by them, a Man valu'd by all
Ranks of Men, <HI>Church or Di&s;&s;enter,</HI> if this ne|ver
weigh'd with them, if the <HI>Hone&s;ty,</HI> the <HI>ju|&s;tice,</HI>
and the <HI>Sea&s;onablene&s;s</HI> of this was never
concerted or debated among them, what &s;hall
be &s;aid for it? They hear of a famous Man,
they have read his Labours in Print; and
upon this they call him at a Venture:
Tho' perhaps had they read more practi|cally,
they would have found their very
Behaviour condemn'd even by him&s;elf.</P>
<P>In the next Place; Do they make En|quiry
into the Obligation &s;uch a <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI>
may be under to the People whom he &s;erves
in his <HI>Mini&s;terial Relation?</HI> This leaves
them, really, under gro&s;s Reflections, as ha|ving
bury'd all Regard to mutual Engage|ment,
and not a little &s;hews a mean Opinion
of the <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> they call, as if he could have
di&s;penc'd with tho&s;e <HI>Relative Obligations,</HI> and
as if the great Con&s;ideration of <HI>U&s;efulne&s;s</HI>
had no Weight with him; or, which is
wor&s;e, as if they would all be born down
by the Bait of a large Income; the Vanity
of being Carefs'd by the Rich Inhabitants of
the Capital City, and the Plea&s;ure of Com|ing
up to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Things leave abundant Room for
the Good People in the Country to reflect
on the Ju&s;tice, Hone&s;ty, and Charity of
their <HI>London</HI> Brethren: But not at all to
thank them for their Kindne&s;s to them;
<PB N="313" REF="324">

<P>What &s;hall we &s;ay next to the wretched
Change among the Lay-part of the <HI>Di&s;&s;en|ters,</HI>
not only that which they are already

they are every Day farther running into, as
to the Management of their Mini&s;ters, when
Cho&s;en. <HI>DiFFicile e&s;t Satyram non Scribere:</HI>
How is the Energy of the Spirit of God,
which accompany'd the la&s;t Age, &s;ucceeded
by Formality, Gaiety, empty Un-meaning
Sound and Jingle of Words, without the
Power and Force, either of Religion or of true
Eloquence, and how are the People pleas'd
with it? Metaphors without Meaning; Stile
without Cadence; Letters without Learn|ing,
and which is wor&s;t of all, Divinity
without Go&s;pel? How does the Excellency
of the Young Race con&s;i&s;t in <HI>Pulpit Ge&s;ture,</HI>
Powder'd <HI>Hair,</HI> Clean <HI>Gloves,</HI> and a Levity
of Behaviour, which I care not to mention?
And how do tho&s;e Things recommend them
to us? Are the&s;e the Men that are God's In|&s;truments
for the Great Work of <HI>Converting
of Souls?</HI> Are the&s;e Men prepared for the
Labourious Self-denying Work of the <HI>Mini|&s;try?</HI>
Are the&s;e the Fruits of a <HI>Holy Devoted
Soul,</HI> Eaten up with the Zeal of God's Hou&s;e,
and who&s;e Heart rejoyces at the Appearance
<PB N="314" REF="325">
and Goings of the Spirit of God in his Sanctu|ary?
And who is it &s;poils the young Mini|&s;ters,
are not the Hearers acce&s;&s;ary?</P>
<P>How many a Hopeful Youth have we had,
that has <HI>&s;et Out</HI> well, that having come from
the Accademy, tho' <HI>alas! before his Time,
as above&s;aid,</HI> with a good Stock of Mode&s;ty,
<HI>&s;ome</HI> Well-meaning, a <HI>few</HI> Letters, <HI>and much
room for more;</HI> has been <HI>Ruin'd</HI> by Flat|tery,
<HI>made Vain</HI> by the Fooli&s;h Care&s;&s;es of
the Town; <HI>Teiz'd</HI> from his Book, by Fea&s;t|ing
and Treating, till fir&s;t, having no Time
to Improve him&s;elf, he goes on, and growing
Conceited by the Praife of the <HI>Ignorant,</HI> at
la&s;t thinks he needs no Improvement at all,
which, had he been let alone, he Had never been
vain enough to believe of him&s;elf: Nor do
they leave him here: The very People that
Care&s;s him are his Ruin, and do him the
greate&s;t Injury in the World, &s;ince, as they
fir&s;t run after him in the Lunacy of their
Judgement, for the Out-&s;ide of his Appear|ance,
and the Surface of his Preaching: So,
for want of a &s;erious Ta&s;te, a Sence of the
Fundamental of the Pulpit Gift; or which
is yet wor&s;e, upon the appearing of &s;ome new
<HI>Blazing-Star</HI> above their Horizon, they all run
away after the Novelty, and, for&s;aking the
former Idol of their Fancy, they leave him as
naked of Admirers, as he was at fir&s;t of Merit.
Thus, having made him wa&s;te the pretious
Moments in which he &s;hould have Improv'd,
they leave him to grow more and more De|&s;picable,
<PB N="315" REF="326">
as he comes to add Age to Empti|ne&s;s,
and Years to want of Judgment: How
is this apparent in many Places of this Town,
where you find tho&s;e Meetings Empty and
Void, where the &s;ame Workmen exert their
parts to the Bare-Walls, who were once the
Celebrated Orators of the Town.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things admit many Enlargements,
and it will be own'd this Book might be fil'd
with Unhappy In&s;tances of like Nature, by
which the <HI>Di&s;&s;enting</HI> Intere&s;t is divided
again&s;t it&s;el. The City &s;et up to Starve the
Country of their Provi&s;ion of Mini&s;ters, and
this added to the Error in Breeding up others,
leaves a &s;ad Pro&s;pect of a Famine at la&s;t; a
Thing it were to be wi&s;h'd, they would take
into immediate Con&s;ideration, which is the
true and only De&s;ign of making the&s;e Mi|&s;takes
&s;o Publick.</P>
<P>The next Article in this unhappy En|quiry,
relating to the Management of our
Mini&s;ters, when they come to Preach,
of cour&s;e leads us back to the Schools,
from whence they I&s;&s;ue Out: It is too Un|grateful
to Repeat what has been &s;aid before
of the unfini&s;h'd Condition which they come
Abroad in. Hitherto it has been alledg'd,
only to be want of Time, and I leave it there,
being willing to avoid making Reflections
upon the Methods of the Schools; yet, to
venture a little upon the Ma&s;ters, which
it is hoped they will Excu&s;e, one Thing
<PB N="316" REF="327">
mu&s;t be own'd to have ill-Effects, and we
find the Con&s;equences of it every Day in
our Young Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>Many of the Tutors in our Accademies,
<HI>I do not &s;ay all, becau&s;e I know &s;ome of ano|ther
Opinion,</HI> being careful to keep the Know|ledge
of the Tongues, or particularly Fond
of <HI>Phylology,</HI> or for what other Rea&s;ons, <HI>per|haps
'tis be&s;t not to enquir,</HI> tie down their
Pupils &s;o exactly, and Limit them &s;o &s;trictly
to perform every Exerci&s;e, and to have all
their Readings in <HI>Latin</HI> or in <HI>Greek,</HI> that, at
the End of the &s;evere&s;t Term of Study, nay,
were they to perform a Quarantine of Years
in the Schools, they come out unacquainted
with <HI>English,</HI> tho' that is the Tongue in
which all their Gifts are to &s;hine. This is
an Abu&s;e &s;o gro&s;s, &s;o undeniable in Fact, and
&s;o mi&s;chievous in Con&s;equence, that it is no
way to be accounted for.</P>
<P>'Tis evident, the great Imperfection of our
Accademies is want of Conver&s;ation; this the
Publick Univer&s;ities enjoy; ours cannot: If a
Man pores upon his Book, and de&s;pi&s;es the
Advantage of Conver&s;ation, he always comes
out a Pedant, a meer Scholar, rough and un|fit
for any thing out of the Walls of his Col|ledge.
Conver&s;ation poli&s;hes the Gentle|men
in Di&s;cour&s;e, acquaints 'em with Men,
and with Words; lets them into the Polite
part of Language; gives them Stile, Accent,
Delicacy, and Ta&s;te in Expre&s;&s;ion; and when
<PB N="317" REF="328">
they come to appear in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> they Preach
as they Di&s;cour&s;e, Ea&s;ie, Free, Plain, Unaf|fected,
and Untainted with Force, Stiffne&s;s,
Formality, affected hard Words, and all the
Ridiculous Parts of a Learned Pedant, which
is being interpreted a <HI>School Fop;</HI> while, on
the other Hand, from our Schools we have
abundance of In&s;tances of Men that come
away Ma&s;ters of Science, Criticks in the
<HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Hebrew,</HI> perfect in Languages;
and perfectly Ignorant (if that Term may be
allow'd) of their Mother Tongue, e&s;pecially
as to the Beauties of Stile, Cadence, and Po|litene&s;s
of Language.</P>
<P>The U&s;efulne&s;s and Excellency of the
Languages is no way run down in this Ob&s;er|vation;
but Preaching the Go&s;pel, which is
the End of our Study, is done in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and
it &s;eems ab&s;urd to the la&s;t Degree, that
all the Time &s;hould be &s;pent in the Lan|guages
which it is to be <HI>Fetch'd from,</HI> and
none in the Language it is to be <HI>Deliver'd
in.</HI> A Man would blu&s;h to Read the very
Orthography of &s;ome among us, who are
Ma&s;ters of all the Oriential Languages, who
can place their Accents right in the <HI>Greek,</HI>
can Critici&s;e on the <HI>Latin,</HI> can Point the
<HI>Hebrew,</HI> and cannot Spell their <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>And why is it that &s;ome of the greate&s;t
Schollars we have had among us, that have
the whole Mi&s;tery of the Go&s;pel in their
Hearts, and a Body of Divinity in their
<PB N="318" REF="329">
Heads, that have a va&s;t Stock of Learning, a
whole Ages Reading, and even a Burthen of
Letters in them, yet Preach away all their
Hearers, for want of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue,
while a Jingling, Noi&s;ie Boy, that has a good
Stock in his Face, and a Dy&s;entry of the
Tongue, tho' he has little or nothing in his
Head, &s;hall run away with the whole Town?
It is true, the Corruption of our Ta&s;te in
Hearing is to be accounted for in this; of
which afterward; but one Error is in the
fir&s;t Concoction. It is true, the Head is the
main Thing that a Tutor is to &s;ee Furni&s;h'd;
but the Tongue mu&s;t be Tuned, or he'll make
no Mu&s;ick with the Voice; &s;o the Hand is
to be Taught to touch the Viol; but if the
Strings are not in Tune, the Mu&s;ick will be
very har&s;h.</P>
<P>Acceptable Words, a good Diction, a Grave,
yet Polite, and Ea&s;ie Stile in the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> is a
mo&s;t taking and valuable Thing in a Mini|&s;ter,
and without which his Learning can|not
exert it&s;elf: This we find generally
Neglected, and left wholly to Nature; and
this is the Mi&s;take &s;poken of.</P>
<P>From this Neglect comes Foppi&s;h <HI>Gaiety,</HI>
Rambling <HI>Di&s;traction,</HI> Stiff <HI>Formality,</HI> and
Surfeiting Affectation in <HI>Stile,</HI> all of them
fatal in their Degree, Unpolite, without
Cadence, without Energy, or without that
Ea&s;ie, Free Plainne&s;s which is the Glory and
Excellency of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="330" MS="Y">
There was, &s;ome Years ago, a private Ac|cademy
of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> not far from <HI>London,</HI>

Declaimings, and Di&s;ertations in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>

Place were not Di&s;titute in the Languages,

His <HI>Examination,</HI> or pa&s;&s;ing <HI>Tryals:</HI> And
it is left to the ju&s;t Reflection of the Mini|&s;ters,
whether &s;everer <HI>Tryals</HI> as well as better
<HI>Te&s;timonials</HI> are not ab&s;olutely Nece&s;&s;ary, be|fore
they admit Young Probationers to the

the very Office, and reduce us to a nece&s;|ary
and ju&s;t Contempt of the Mini&s;try for the
fake of the Mini&s;ters.</P>

This is but a hint; I know it has its Diffi|culties,
nor are they ea&s;ie to be &s;urmounted,
and therefore the le&s;s is &s;aid to it: But one
Thing cannot be omitted, and which mu&s;t be
acknowledg'd to be for the Service of the
<HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> if they plea&s;e to take the Hint as
kindly as it is meant.</P>
<P>This concerns the Admitting, or giving
Ordination, if we may &s;tile it &s;o, to Young
Men coming out of <HI>Scotland.</HI> The State of
which Ca&s;e is, in &s;hort, thus:</P>
<P>The Conditions of Admi&s;&s;ion, and the
Tryals of Mini&s;ters in <HI>Scotland,</HI> to the Hon|our
of their Di&s;cipline be it &s;aid, are very
&s;evere; and the Ob&s;ervation of it &s;o &s;t$$t,
that it is impo&s;&s;ible for Men of a mean $e|gree
of Study to get into a Pulpit. It is not
to the Purpo&s;e to Debate here, the ab&s;o|lute
Nece&s;&s;ity of School Learning to a Mi|ni&s;ter,
or how far the Office depends upon
the Ordination of Mini&s;ters, or the Call and
Efficency of the Spirit of God, &s;ince we are
&s;peaking to tho&s;e who, however they regard
the Latter, do in&s;i&s;t upon the Former; and
it will appear the Mi&s;chief lies in admitting
&s;uch who, pretending to both, are po&s;&s;e&s;s'd
of neither; the La&s;t will not admit a Tryal,
but the Fir&s;t will, and 'tis of that Tryal
which may be had that we are now &s;peaking.</P>
<P>The Fact is undeniable, if a Young Stu|dent
has been Idle, and Mi&s;-&s;pent his Hours,
if he has been Impatient, and thinks the
<PB N="321" REF="332">
Time too long, or if Conceited of him&s;elf,
and thinks he is Quallify'd, before his Su|periors
think &s;o; if he has Mi&s;behav'd, and,
perhaps, been Extruded the College, or In|curr'd
Scandal, and therefore not admitted
to Preach, he has no more to do but come
away to <HI>England:</HI> Here he either gets Ad|mittance,
upon &s;light Examination, or runs
into the Office without any other Admit|tance,
than that of the next Mini&s;ter that
will lend him a Pulpit: It will be needle&s;s
to give In&s;tances of a Thing that we are all
&s;en&s;ible of, and which the People in <HI>Scot|land</HI>
wonder at; the Bu&s;ine&s;s rather is how
to remedy the Evil, and prevent the Con|&s;equences
of it; and this is &s;o ea&s;ie, that no|thing
but a total Neglect of it can be an|&s;wer'd,
in the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Would the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> &s;uffer no <HI>Scot&s;man</HI>
to Preach among them, unle&s;s he &s;hew'd
Authentic Documents of his having been
admitted to the Mini&s;try in <HI>Scotland;</HI> and
would they admit none to the Office but
&s;uch as, be&s;ides their Examination, brought
Certificates from the Principal, and Profe&s;&s;or
of Divinity in the College where they Stu|dy'd,
and from the <HI>Pre&s;bytery</HI> of the Bounds
where they la&s;t Liv'd; the fir&s;t &s;ignifying
their Studies, and Proficency in the Schools,
and the latter te&s;tifying their being free
from Scandal, and of a good Character: If
this &s;hort Method were ob&s;erv'd, I. <HI>Scotland</HI>
<PB N="322" REF="333">
would be oblig'd to you, for that their
Scoundrels and Idle Ones would not Con|temn
their Di&s;cipline, in hopes of being ad|mitted
in <HI>England:</HI> They mu&s;t then Study
hard, Apply clo&s;e, and Live &s;oberly, or they
mu&s;t not expect to be receiv'd: And (2)
you would cea&s;e to be the Sink of their Filth,
the Receiver of their Refu&s;ings, and the Re|fuge
of the Meane&s;t and mo&s;t Uncapable of
their Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>It comes next to &s;peak of the Behaviour
of the&s;e Young Proficient Gentlemen, when
they get into the Office: How they have taken
up a Method of Preaching quite different
from what was the Antient Practice; how,
under pretence of Cadence and Regularity,
which yet they want, they have brought the
whole Work to a cold declaiming way of De|livery,
the very &s;ame we formerly blamed and
de&s;pi&s;ed Others for; how, from a Cautious
and Conceal'd u&s;ing of Notes, as our Mini&s;ters
were wont to u&s;e them, they are come to
an Avow'd, Open, and General <HI>Sermon-Read|ing;</HI>
the meer Effect of Sloth, and without
which they could not make one Sermon &s;erve
many Months, nay Years, upon every Occa|&s;ional
Preaching: So, taking away the Occa|&s;ion
of Study, as the great Drudgery of the
Office, and this not only is too much the
Practice, but it is now pretended a Mini&s;ter
ought not to Preach without them.</P>
<P>What is become of the Zeal, the Affection,
<PB N="323" REF="334">
and the Warmth of the Pulpit, which the pa&s;t
Age were Witne&s;&s;es of, is hard to determine:
As to our Modern Preachers they De&s;pi&s;e it
all, they call it, <HI>the Mechani&s;m of the Spirit;</HI>
and re&s;olve it into a kind of Prie&s;t-Craft, by
which they &s;ay Preachers could rai&s;e and
let fall their Hearers as they had Occa|&s;ion;
and now they are to tell you, that
the Spirit of God, being to Work by the
Word, there is no Occa&s;ion for the Mi|ni&s;ter
to mind how he Delievers it, &s;o that
the Matter be good. From this coldne&s;s in
Preaching, as a mo&s;t Natural Con&s;equence
follows carele&s;s Hearing, Sleeping, all man|ner
of Indecency, and at la&s;t a Contempt of
Ordinances, and bringing them down to a
meer Cour&s;e of Things, which are di&s;charg'd
in the Duty of Attendance without any re|gard
to the Manner: But of this part by it
&s;elf.</P>
<P>From this coldne&s;s in Preaching and For|mality
in one part of the Work proceeds a
proportion'd Neglect of the other great Work
of a Mini&s;ter, I mean <HI>Prayer:</HI> However we
Object again&s;t Forms, this is now become as
Formal as that we Object again&s;t; nay, &s;ome
may be named who Write them down, and
Read their <HI>Prayers</HI> as they do their <HI>Sermons:
Sacraments</HI> are admini&s;ter'd with unu&s;ual
want of Solemnity; and they are &s;o &s;hie of
attempting to act the Affections, that they
&s;eem to perform all the Wor&s;hip, and admi|nifter
<PB N="324" REF="335">
all the Ordinances of the Go&s;pel, as
if the Affections were not in the lea&s;t con|cern'd
in them.</P>
<P>In the Pulpit all manner of Ge&s;ture is ob|&s;erv'd,
that may render them acceptable to the
Eyes, not the Ears of their Hearers; and the
new Fa&s;hion'd young Mini&s;ters Powder and
Dre&s;s, as if the Pulpit was the Stage, and
they came there to make their Addre&s;s to the
Ladies. God Almighty is &s;poken to rather
with Good Manners, than with Reverence;
and they rather approach him with <HI>Air</HI> and
<HI>Mein,</HI> than with <HI>Fear</HI> and <HI>Trembling: Prayer</HI>
with them is the Golde&s;t, the Dulle&s;t, the
mo&s;t Unaffecting Thing in the World; and,
indeed, they have mo&s;t effectually &s;ecured
them&s;elves from the Scandal of de&s;igning to
Work upon the Affections with it: There
is, indeed, one kind of <HI>Mechani&s;m</HI> left among
them, and which they take Care not to fail
of, <HI>viz.</HI> That as &s;ome Preachers move one
Sence, &s;ome another; &s;ome rai&s;e the Pa&s;&s;ion
of <HI>Fear;</HI> &s;ome of <HI>Love;</HI> &s;ome Excite <HI>Zeal;</HI>
&s;ome <HI>Charity,</HI> the&s;e mo&s;t effectually rai&s;e
a mighty Propen&s;ity to Sleep, and act beyond
an Opiate upon the Faculty of Drow&s;ine&s;s,
Charming their Auditory into <HI>Silver Sham|bers,</HI>
which, according to a certain Modern
Orator, <HI>Are Golden Mercies.</HI></P>
<P>From their Pulpit Labours, and the
Drudgery of the Day, you may view them
in their Week, they are of too much Bu&s;i|ne&s;s
<PB N="325" REF="336">
to be much at Home, except on <HI>Satur|day,</HI>
and then they mu&s;t not be di&s;turb'd;
There, at once, is all Opportunity taken from
their poor Hearers to Vi&s;it, or Con&s;ult with
their <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> whatever their Ca&s;es, ei|ther
of <HI>Con&s;eience</HI> or otherwi&s;e, may be, for
they are hardly ever to be found; and as to
Vi&s;iting their Hearers, if they are Rich, they
grow not only Vi&s;itors but Companions: But
if Poor, it is not hard to name &s;ome Young
<HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> in this City, who have not been to
vi&s;it &s;ome of the Poor, or Antient Members
of their Congregations in &s;everal Years.</P>
<P>The Vanity in Garb, the Exorbitance of
Living, the Gaiety in their Families, to|gether
with their Haughty in&s;tead of Hum|ble
Behaviour, of the&s;e Young New Advanc'd
Gentlemen in their Conver&s;ation I omit here,
not that they do not admini&s;ter abundant
Matter of Reflection, and a &s;ad Pro&s;pect for
the Time to come, but becau&s;e this At|tempt
is meant rather to Correct the Foun|dation
Evil, and Removing the Cau&s;es,
than to attack the <HI>Vice</HI> of our Young Cler|gy,
which, being rooted in their Ignorance
and Want of Learning, lies too deep to be
pull'd out; for <HI>Conceit</HI> and <HI>Affectation</HI> is the
certain Produce of a little Learning, as <HI>Hu|mility</HI>
is of a great deal.</P>
<P>3. The Third and La&s;t Article laid down,
in the Beginning of this E&s;&s;ay, is the Ta&s;te
of our People in Hearing; and, indeed, this
<PB N="326" REF="337">
&s;uffers equal Defection: Whether the wo|ful
Degeneracy of the <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> proceeds from
that of the People, or this Error of the People
from the <HI>Mini&s;try,</HI> &s;hall not be enquir'd here,
lea&s;t the Evil &s;hould appear Reciprocal, and
they be found like Men in a Plague, mu|tually
to Infect one another.</P>
<P>That our Ta&s;te of Preaching is alter'd
with the Preaching, is evident from the
People we run after, and the People we run
from; from our Manner of Hearing, and
Manner of Living under the Operation of
a <HI>Prote&s;tant Go&s;pel Mini&s;try.</HI></P>
<P>In the Choice of our Preachers, what In|&s;tances
have we to determine us by, when,
as before is noted, a Half-bred Youth that
makes, as we call it, a good Figure in the
Pulpit, one of Mr. <HI>Burge&s;s's</HI> Furbelo'd
Preachers that has a little Mu&s;ick upon
his Tongue, and Reads hand&s;omely, that
Talks apace, has the Gift of the Gob,
and plea&s;es our Fancy, &s;hall run away with
the whole Town, and draw Crowds of Hea|rers
after him, while the Aged, the Learn'd,
the Serious, the Painful Preachers that, as
before, have the E&s;&s;ence of the Work in
their Heads, and the Succe&s;s of it upon their
Hearts, preach to the bare Walls, and &s;ee
their Auditors Daily for&s;ake them. This
might be illu&s;trated by Names of Men: But
that this Paper avoids Entring into Per&s;onal
Characters, any Man may be &s;atisfy'd of this
<PB N="327" REF="338">
that has &s;een, or heard of the Treatment of
many of our antient Mini&s;ters lately Dead, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
and &s;et them again&s;t others, whom we need
not go far to name. Next we may ob&s;erve
the Conviction which this Error brings along
with it, and how Time makes them a&s;ham'd
of their Folly: And this appears in their
Abandoning again tho&s;e they have once been
&s;o fond of; after their glutted Fancy, tir'd
with the Novelty, has Nau&s;eated tho&s;e they
have Idoliz'd before; this is &s;een in many
In&s;tances now among us, which al&s;o I for|bear
to name.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;o many Te&s;timonies, that the
Ta&s;te of the Town, debauch'd by Novelty,
is corrupted and carry'd away with a Stream;
that the true <HI>Go&s;pel Principle</HI> of Hearing the
Word without Re&s;pect of Per&s;ons, is lo&s;t
from among us; and the Times &s;eem to have
ju&s;t &s;uch a Turn as is &s;aid of the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI>
Ages in <HI>England,</HI> in former Days, <HI>viz.</HI> That
in the <HI>Saxon</HI> Times they had <HI>Wooden Cha|lices</HI>
and <HI>Golden Prie&s;ts,</HI> but afterwards, as
the Times mended, and the Nation grew
Rich, they had <HI>Golden Chalices,</HI> and then
they had <HI>Wooden Prie&s;ts.</HI> This, indeed, is
the Di&s;a&s;ter of the <HI>Toleration;</HI> as all Sweet
Things have their Bitter in them&s;elves: Be|fore
the <HI>Toleration</HI> we had a <HI>Wooden People</HI>
and <HI>Golden Mini&s;ters;</HI> &s;ince we got Ea&s;e
and Wealth, we have a <HI>Golden People,</HI> but
God knows we are in a fair Way to have
a <HI>Wooden Mini&s;try.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="339">
It has been touch'd already how our Car|re&s;&s;ing,
Courting, Treating, and Flattering
our Young <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> has been fatal to them,
as it robs them of their Time, the Life
Blood of their Work, as it puffs up, prompts
their Vanity, and fills them with Conceit
of their real Worth, when it may, perhaps,
be little more than Imaginary: Youth can|not
always bear Prai&s;e, nor judge when they
ought to value it, or how much. On the
other Hand, the Evils of the Times have re|quir'd
a reciprocal Compliance in the <HI>Mini|&s;ters</HI>
with the corrupt Latitudes of their Hear|ers,
the <HI>Occa&s;ional Conformity</HI> of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI>
too ju&s;tly call'd <HI>Hypocri&s;y</HI> by their Enemies,
has not only been practis'd by the Hearers,
but has been, at their Reque&s;t, defended and
allow'd by &s;ome of their <HI>Mini&s;ters;</HI> and tho&s;e
Gentlemen have &s;et them&s;elves up to defend
it at the &s;ame Time that they profe&s;s'd &s;ta|ted
<HI>Non-Conformity</HI> as a Duty; but how
Woodenly they have done it; how they
are now a&s;ham'd of it; and what Ruin this
has brought upon the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> our Silence
now acknowledges.</P>
<P>How evidently this <HI>Occa&s;ional Conformity</HI>
tends to, and in Po&s;terity re&s;olves in a com|pleat
Conformity, is too evident to need any
farther Enquiry, and how directly this De|fection
of the <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> tends to both, is al&s;o
very plain: It needs no Enquiry whether the
Decay of Preaching &s;hould bring a Decay
<PB N="329" REF="340">
of Practi&s;e, and whether a cold <HI>Mini&s;try</HI>
&s;hould not produce a carele&s;s People.</P>
<P>Let the Manner of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> Conduct,
under this new-fa&s;hion'd Di&s;pen&s;ation, be
but examin'd: Go to their Hou&s;es, and how
is the Wor&s;hip of God maintain'd there?
Let it be enquir'd whether one Ma&s;ter of a
Family in ten prays with his Family, or cate|chi&s;es
his Children, or ob&s;erves the Sabbath-Day,
of that great Number who practis'd all
the&s;e within the&s;e Twenty Years pa&s;t: And
where are their Reprovers? Where the <HI>Mi|ni&s;ter</HI>
that examines them about it? or re|proves
them for Want of it?</P>
<P>In former Days, in our <HI>Meetings,</HI> was
another Face of Hearing; &s;ome Writing;
&s;ome Following the <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> with their Bi|bles;
all Attentive: Now Writing is uni|ver&s;ally
laid a&s;ide, as out of Fa&s;hion; and
for the Bible, take this In&s;tance, an eminent
<HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> coming to preach, ca&s;ually, at a cer|tain
<HI>Meeting-Hou&s;e,</HI> near <HI>London,</HI> and ha|ving
forgotten his Bible, could not borrow
one in the whole Congregation, till, at la&s;t,
one poor Woman, by Accident, came in with
a Bible. So u&s;ele&s;s it is to examine or en|quire
into what the <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> &s;ays, or to mi|nute
down his Proofs, in Order to review
and reflect on what has been heard.</P>
<P>The Word of God is an ine&s;timable Trea|&s;ure,
but we have it now in &s;uch Earthen
Ve&s;&s;els, that, really, the Trea&s;ure is made a

and make the People abhor the Offer|ing
of the Lord.</P>
<P>The Matters of Fact being thus touch'd

<P>The Young Men begin under two in&s;u|perable

of Re&s;entment: Let any one tell us from
which of the&s;e &s;hould they be furni&s;h'd to
re&s;i&s;t Temptation: Their want of Bread can|not
a&s;&s;i&s;t them to refu&s;e a good Living; want
of Learning can never fail to prompt them
to go over to a People, with whom it can
better be pa&s;s'd over, and who have
Country Livings to &s;upply, where it can|not
be di&s;cover'd; Pride will never prompt
a Man to be a <HI>Di&s;&s;enter,</HI> where there is &s;o
little Pro&s;pect of Encouragement, and &s;o
little Room to Ri&s;e. Re&s;entment is grati|fy'd
to the highe&s;t Degree; for, by going
over, they have a full Occa&s;ion to fall upon
them that us'd them, as they think, with
&s;o much Inequallity, and treated them &s;o
haughtily.</P>
<P>Here begins the ill Blood that breaks out
as &s;oon as they go off; and from hence
it is that we have nothing &s;o bitter writ|ten,

&s;uch of their young <HI>Mini&s;ters,</HI> who have,

<P>It may not be unworthy here of the <HI>Di&s;&s;en|ters</HI>

Intere&s;t, with too much Slight and Neglect;
and &s;ome that have merited better from them
with <HI>Contempt</HI> and <HI>unju&s;t Reproach:</HI> How this
&s;hould end in any Thing, but in Turning
the Hands again&s;t them that would other|wi&s;e
have been employ'd for them, is hard
to imagine: Till they think fit to alter this,
they cannot expect to have many Defenders,
or ever to want furious Enemies: Nature is
born with Re&s;entment, and when Men that
&s;erve Faithfully, and hazard them&s;elves Zea|lou&s;ly,
meet with Reproaches for Rewards,
and haughty contemptible Carriage in&s;tead
of Countenance and Encouragement; Pa&s;&s;i|on
will prevail to &s;et them again&s;t the Peo|ple
they otherwi&s;e would adhere to; every
Man cannot &s;erve and &s;tarve for them: Let
tho&s;e that think this Hint unju&s;t, look
back on Mr. <HI>Delaune;</HI> let them a&s;k Mr. <HI>We&s;s|ley</HI>
why he conform'd; let them enquire of
poor <HI>Tutchin's</HI> Friends, and look upon the
Circum&s;tances of his Widow and Family;
let them enquire of the Fate of <HI>Harry Care,</HI>
and how Want of being &s;upported forc'd
him to &s;ubmit to their Enemies; and let
them look round them for other Objects of
like Kind without Number.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> think their Ca&s;e needs
no Champions, their Cau&s;e needs no Advo|cates,
their Defence calls for no A&s;&s;i&s;tance,
they would do well to think again; it is

their innumerable Reproaches, Expo&s;ing
their Attempts to ruin them, and their At|tacks
upon them, have, by all wi&s;e Men, and
who have a true Sen&s;e of their Intere&s;t, been
found to be of Service to them; and this
has &s;et their Enemies, who&s;e Eyes are al|ways
open to it, at Work to tempt, to buy
off, and by all Means po&s;&s;ible to draw away
&s;uch Helps from them; and in this they
have had too much Succe&s;s, the Per&s;ons ha|ving
been pinch'd with &s;evere Circum&s;tan|ces
on one Hand; totally &s;lighted, and neg|lected
by the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> on the other; and
clo&s;ely be&s;ieg'd with Invitations, Promi&s;es,
and large Offers of Preferment and Support
by the Enemy; of this too many Examples
might be given to leave Room for any Ob|jection:
And it is to be doubted the Time is
at Hand, when Experience will &s;peak too
plainly that this has been a great Mi&s;take in
the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters;</HI> whether they will mend it
or no, Time mu&s;t inform us.</P>
<P>This Tract will not afford Room to be lar|ger
upon the&s;e Things, and therefore it has
only touch'd the Particulars in a &s;ummary
Way, without Entring Hi&s;torically into the
Matters of Fact; it is pre&s;um'd the Sugge|&s;tions
are unconte&s;table, and the Con&s;equen|ces
drawn &s;o ju&s;t as to admit very little
Objection. However, if any Body thinks
<PB N="334" REF="345">
fit to object, the Field is wide, he may begin
when he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to remain that the Complainer
&s;hould propo&s;e what Remedy is proper in
the&s;e Things. Many can find a Fault to
one that can mend it, he only is a wi&s;e Re|prover
who Reproves for a Reformation;
yet this is not difficult: The greate&s;t Ob&s;ta|cle
appears in Convincing the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> of
the Error. Few will believe the Mi&s;chief
is true, or that &s;uch Evils are upon them.
This Method is taken, private Admonitions
having been in vain offer'd, to convince them
of the Fact; it is for them to con&s;ider of Re|medies.
Tho&s;e Remedies are ea&s;y: As a
Man's Sin is &s;ometimes read in his Puni&s;h|ment,
&s;o Remedies are directed by the Di&s;|ea&s;es.</P>
<P>Particularly in the Conduct of their
Fund, and Breeding up their Mini&s;ters:
Would they calculate their Stock, and take
in no more than they can <HI>Maintain,</HI> they
would &s;oon &s;ee a Difference: <HI>By maintain</HI> is
meant, 1. maintain at the Schools a compleat
Time, that they might not be thru&s;t out
unfini&s;h'd, and mount the <HI>Pulpit</HI> before they
are fit for the De&s;k; and 2. maintain after|wards
till they may be provided for.</P>
<P>Every Boy the <HI>Blue-Coat Ho&s;pital</HI> brings
up, they put out Apprentice when they
have done with him at School; when he
comes out of his Time they know he cannot
<PB N="335" REF="346">
Work without Tools, or &s;et up without
Help, their Care is therefore not at an End
till they have &s;upply'd him to &s;et up the
Trade; and then, if he cannot Live he may
Starve, he de&s;erves no Pity.</P>
<P>But our Young Mini&s;ters are turn'd loo&s;e
like Vagrants to &s;eek their Fortunes. When
they are &s;omething le&s;s than half taught
their Bu&s;ine&s;s, then they are left naked with|out
Help to compleat the re&s;t, or act for
them&s;elves; if you would have the FUND
rai&s;e Mini&s;ters, Mini&s;ters fit for the Work,
Mini&s;ters that &s;hall cleave to you, and not
fly in your Faces, Mini&s;ters you &s;hall not
be a&s;ham'd of, and that will not be a&s;ham'd
of you; take in about one Fifth of the
Number you now take in, and fix your
Number to the Strength of your Fund, not
to go beyond it; when you are pre&s;s'd to
take a Youth, in re&s;pect to the Circum&s;tan|ces
of his Parents or Family, (keep a Part of
the Stock ready for that Work) give Ten
Pounds to put him out Apprentice to a <HI>Shooe|maker</HI>
or a <HI>Barber,</HI> or any Thing, and re&s;erve
20<HI>l.</HI> to &s;et him up, make him any thing but a
Mini&s;ter, tho' it were a <HI>Chimney-Sweeper;</HI>
but to make him a Mini&s;ter, you both ruin
the Boy, and make him help to &s;tarve and
ruin the re&s;t.</P>
<P>When you have a Set Number, &s;uch as
your Fund can keep, let them be kept as
they &s;hould be; let them have due In&s;pectors
<PB N="336" REF="347">
over their Morals and Capacities, that it
may be known early, whether a Lad will
be&s;t make a Mini&s;ter or a Porter, an In|&s;tructor
of others, or a due Member of the
Hou&s;e of Correction; whether he is likelie&s;t
for the Pulpit or the Gallows; for &s;uch are
among us, and will always be; do this,
and you need not be at Charges to no Pur|po&s;e,
be&s;towing ju&s;t enough to &s;piol them
for one, and fit them for t'other.</P>
<P>If he has a Genius, if he applies, if he is
&s;ober, diligent and capable, nouri&s;h him, &s;up|ply
him with Books, and give him Time;
at lea&s;t Twelve Years Study &s;hould be al|low'd
to fini&s;h a Mini&s;ter; if he &s;hines &s;ooner
you will &s;ee the Light, and you may give
him Leave to appear Abroad; if he is other|wi&s;e,
if he proves a Blockhead, or a Rake,
di&s;mi&s;s him early, that he may go to a Trade,
and avoid his De&s;truction. When your
Young Student comes Abroad, do not &s;tarve
him, but allow him a competent Mainte|nance
till he is &s;ettled and provided for:
Then he would have no Need to ply as
before, and &s;olicit for Work, a thing too
much below the Dignity of his Offce; if he
was wanted to preach, he would be found
in his Study, and the longer it was before
he was provided, the better he would act
when he came in.</P>
<P>What if the Expence of this le&s;&s;en'd your
Number, and you bred up one to five, nay,
<PB N="337" REF="348">
to Fifteen of tho&s;e that now con&s;ume the
Charity of your People, that ONE would
be a Man, and a Mini&s;ter, and would do
more Good than the Fifteen. The fewer
you breed up, the fewer Beggars you would
have; the fewer Hone&s;t Men you would
ruin; the fewer you would bring up to be
&s;tarv'd; and the fewer Rennegado's you
would make, to fall upon you again in their
turn, and Reproach you and the whole Party
with your ill U&s;age of them.</P>
<P>If 500<HI>l.</HI> now rai&s;es you five Young Mini|&s;ters,
and you &s;pent that 500<HI>l.</HI> all upon One,
that One would be a <HI>Clark&s;on,</HI> or a <HI>Charnock,</HI>
a Bullwark to <HI>Religion,</HI> an Honour to the
<HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> a Champion to the <HI>Cau&s;e,</HI> while
the other Method brings five Conceited,
Brain-proud Youths into the World to Di&s;|grace
the <HI>Pulpit,</HI> Offend the Sincere Profe&s;&s;ors
of <HI>Religion,</HI> and afford Laughter and Mockery
to your <HI>Enemies,</HI> Thus the Charity of your
People is mi&s;apply'd, the Young Men ruin'd,
the Work of the <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> banter'd and expos'd,
the People Fed with Froth, and <HI>Whipt-Crea$</HI>
in&s;tead of the <HI>Sound Milk</HI> of the <HI>Word; Reli|gion</HI>
becomes a Je&s;t, and the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> will, if
this be not Reform'd, be the Hi&s;&s;ing and Scoff
of the Nation: God guide you all to apply a
&s;peedy Remedy to it, or to throw up the
Cau&s;e of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> and leave it to the

<HEAD>THE CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>_TO Conclude this Unplea&s;ant
but Nece&s;&s;ary Part, I cannot
but recommend &s;ome Things
to the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> which &s;hall
clo&s;e the Whole, and which
I think greatly concerns
them. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That however the Service of God,
in the Mini&s;try, is under Di&s;couragements;
and among the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> their Mini&s;ters may
expect <HI>Contempt, Reproach, Per&s;ecution,</HI> and
to be confin'd to mean <HI>Circum&s;tances;</HI> yet
as the Employ is honourable, and merits
to be honour'd, they would not Di&s;honour it
&s;o much, as to think it below Breeding up
tho&s;e Children to it, when they have Eftates
to give them. It &s;eems to me to argue great
Indifferency to, and unconcernedne&s;s in the
Intere&s;t of Religion, that few of our Chil|dren
&s;hould be brought up to the Work of a
Mini&s;ter, but tho&s;e who have not Bread to
Eat, and mu&s;t be furni&s;h'd by the Charity of
the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters;</HI> and this in a Day when that
<PB N="339" REF="350">
<HI>Charity</HI> runs &s;o low, and is in danger of be|ing
yet lower.</P>
<P>It may be faid, without reflecting, in the
lea&s;t, upon any now in the Mini&s;try, that,
did the Rich Part of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> breed up
their Children to be Mini&s;ters, equally with
the Poor, &s;o that tho&s;e Young Men, &s;o bred
up, had Sub&s;i&s;tance of their own to depend
upon, whereby all the Mi&s;chiefs touch'd at
before, would be avoided, and they could
take due time to furni&s;h, and fini&s;h them|&s;elves
before they ventur'd upon &s;o awful a
Work you would &s;ee a Change in your
Affairs, and the Reputation; of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI>
would ri&s;e in proportion; for nothing ca&s;ts
&s;o great a Contempt upon any People, as a
Contemptible Clergy.</P>
<P>I know the Spirit of God is not confin'd
to &s;tudy Learning, length of Time, or any
Human Means. But even tho&s;se who are mo&s;t
apt to lay &s;tre&s;s upon the Efficiency of the
Spirit, without helps of Letters, Study, and
Application, will not pretend that the&s;e Helps
are a Hinderance to that Spirit: But we are
&s;peaking now of the Intere&s;t, as it re&s;ect the
Times, and the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> as a Party; in which
the want of the&s;e outward Means has produc'd
&s;uch Mi&s;chievous Effects among us; That
Breach would be heal'd, if all our Mini&s;ters
were rais'd of &s;uch who had at lea&s;t &s;ome
Competent Sub&s;i&s;tence to depend upon, to
prevent the mean Hackneying them&s;elves
<PB N="340" REF="351">
about for Bread, which takes them off from
following the Outward helps of Learning, or
a Retirement &s;uited to that Application to
their Work, which is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to
its Succe&s;s. And why &s;hould a Man think
a Thou&s;and Pound, if he can give it to a Son,
ill-be&s;tow'd to make him a Mini&s;ter of the
Go&s;pel, while we &s;ee Ladies of much greater
Fortunes think it not thrown away upon
&s;uch, though they have not oftentimes any
Foundation of their own?</P>
<P>It were very happy for a Young Mini&s;ter,
if he had 50 or 60<HI>l. per Annum</HI> of his own,
that if he is called to a middling Stipend, he
may not refu&s;e God's Work for want of &s;u&s;|ficient
Maintenance; that Mini&s;ters may not
&s;tand at catch, and form Parties, even to In|triegues,
to get into this or that Congre|gation;
that they may not for&s;ake their
Flocks when fix'd, upon the mean Con&s;idera|tion
of a better Sallary: This would be the
way to &s;pread the Di&s;&s;enting Mini&s;try into
the remote&s;t Corners, and have the Go&s;pel
preach'd without mercenary Aims, or cove|teous
De&s;ires: A thou&s;and happy Things
would be the Con&s;equence of this Practice;
the Mini&s;ters of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> would &s;upport
the Maje&s;ty of the Office, become truly Re|verend,
and re&s;tore the Character tho&s;e of
the la&s;t Age have le&s;t behind them; not that
the Money would alone do it: But the many
&s;candalous Mi&s;chiefs which now unavoidably
<PB N="341" REF="352">
follow, the Introduction of <HI>Beggars</HI> and <HI>Alms-People</HI>
into the Mini&s;try would be prevented
mo&s;t effectually by it, and the re&s;t would fol|low
of Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Nay, were this once the Practice none but
Men of Sub&s;tance would be thought Compe|tent;
for the other not being able to &s;it them|&s;elves
for the Work, for want of Stock, would
not make the Attempt; or if they did, would
come to nothing: And &s;o let it be; Let <HI>Beg|gars</HI>
be bred to the Ax and the Hammer;
let the <HI>Poor</HI> be left to Labour; tho&s;e that
are to be &s;et a-part for God &s;hould not be
&s;ingled out of tho&s;e that could not have
Bread to Eat: Indeed, if it were a National
Church, where Publick Provi&s;ion was made
for the Introduction of Mini&s;ters, and legal
Stipends appointed, when they were call'd,
&s;omething might be &s;aid.</P>
<P>But as the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> are &s;tated, it is quite
another Ca&s;e; in many Places, Preaching
the Go&s;pel is al mo&s;t a Work of <HI>Charity</HI> to
the People: How &s;hall the Promi&s;e of our Sa|viour
be accompli&s;h'd, <HI>that the Poor have the
Go&s;pel preach'd to them,</HI> while we Invert the
Sentence, and &s;ay, <HI>By the Poor is the Go&s;pel
preached,</HI> and while our Mini&s;ters are the
Product of our Charity? What Awe, what
Reverence, will the&s;e beget who Preach for
Bread, in the gro&s;e&s;t Sence, that are even <HI>bred
up</HI> to Preach for <HI>Bread.</HI> The&s;e, truly, make
<HI>Religion a Trade; the Pulpit</HI> is their Shop, and
<PB N="342" REF="353">
their <HI>Schooling</HI> their Apprentice&s;hip, though
they often &s;et up without Stock, or Tools to
Work with.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> ever will re&s;tore their
Figure in the World, it mu&s;t be by re&s;toreing
their Mini&s;try; and this will never be done,
while they them&s;elves have &s;o Contemptible
an Opinion of the Mini&s;try, that whoever
can give his Son 500 I. to begin the World,
will Scorn to thro' him away upon the <HI>Office;</HI>
and would think it a ruin to him, to make
him a Mini&s;ter: Whereas, on the Contrary,
a Thou&s;and Pound is as little as can be be|&s;towed
to Set out a Man for that Work, &s;o
as to be an Honour to the Office of a Mini|&s;ter,
or Capable of being helpful to the In|tere&s;t
of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> and to keep him&s;elf,
and that Intere&s;t, from Contempt. I am in
hopes &s;ome among the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> already &s;ee
this Error, and a few there are who have at|tempted
to mend it: We &s;ee &s;ome Hone&s;t Men
Dedicating their Po&s;terity to the Work of the
Mini&s;try, to whom they can give Honourable
Maintenance; but the Number of the&s;e are
Few, and the Admonition I hope is not in
Vain: All Men who have any Re&s;pect for the
Intere&s;t of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> wi&s;h they may be
Supply'd with &s;uch Per&s;ons as may be an Hon|our
to Religion, and may bear the Weight of
their Intere&s;t in this World, as well as propa|gate
the Work of the Go&s;pel for the Next.</P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="354">
I hope none of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> will &s;ugge&s;t
from this Di&s;cour&s;e, that I do not allow there
are many very good, well fini&s;h'd, and mo&s;t
excellent Men among the Mini&s;ters of the
<HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> altho; as on the one Side, to avoid
Di&s;&s;couraging and Expo&s;ing &s;ome, &s;o, on the
other Side, to avoid Flattery and Panegy|rick,
I have left Names entirely out of this
Di&s;cour&s;e: I acknowledge the Merit of the&s;e,
and &s;hall, on all Occa&s;ions, &s;tudy to do them
Ju&s;tice; I reverence their Per&s;ons, and put a
double Value upon them, by how much I
lament the Paucity of their Number; I
prav that they may be encreas'd, and the
<HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> ble&s;s'd with &s;uch a Mini&s;try as
may pre&s;erve, encrea&s;e, and e&s;abli&s;h the In|tere&s;t
of true Religion and Godline&s;s among
them: But, on the other Hand, I appeal to
the&s;e very Mini&s;ters for the Truth and
Ju&s;tice of what I have written, <HI>viz.</HI> Whe|ther
there is not a &s;ad Defection among the
<HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in this Ca&s;e; Whether, if a Re|form
be not made, their Intere&s;t mu&s;t not
inevitably &s;ink; and to this End the&s;e
Sheets are written, and no other. To &s;ay it
expo&s;es the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> is to &s;ay nothing; I
am &s;ure the Mi&s;chie&s; will not expo&s;e them
only, but ruin them; let it be amended; it
will be no Reproach to them to Correct their
own Mi&s;takes: Their Enemies dread the Re|formation
of it, and triumph, Daily, in the
Thoughts of its being impo&s;&s;ible to be reco|ver'd
<PB N="344" REF="355">
but, <HI>Nil De&s;perandum,</HI> I hope &s;till they
will be awaken'd to &s;ee the Mi&s;take, and to
apply the proper Antidote to the Poi&s;on.</P>
<P>Nor do I, in this, object again&s;t our Acca|demies
as &s;uch, or as incapable of Fini&s;hing
the Youth &s;ent thither, in their Studies, or
Quallifying them for the Work of the <HI>Mini|&s;try,</HI>
would tho&s;e but allow Time for the Per|formance.
I own the Tutors are under Di&s;|couragements,
which the Circum&s;tances of
the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> render unavoidable; but this is
not the Complaint. The Want of Time, the
ill Choice of the Youth, and the unhappy
Crowd thru&s;t in: Tho&s;e are the Foundations
of all the Evil, <HI>of which as before,</HI> and this is
what every one will own may be remedy'd.</P>
<P>2. It remains now to enquire into the State
of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> as it now &s;tands, and as it
re&s;pects their politick Intere&s;t under the new
Alteration of their Circum&s;tances, of which
the Hi&s;torical Part is related in the foregoing
Sheet; and what is their pre&s;ent Work, as
their Affairs are now &s;cituated.</P>
<P>Since the Writing of the foregoing Sheets,
the <HI>Occa&s;ional Bill</HI> takes Place, and the <HI>Di&s;|&s;enters,</HI>
continuing &s;uch, are univer&s;ally &s;hut
out from Places, Po&s;ts of Honour, Profit,
Tru&s;t, Magi&s;tracy, and the like; I know
there are Ways and Means how to evade
this Act, and avoid the Force of it, and a
few, for a &s;hort Time, may &s;hift and &s;huffle
with it; of which I need &s;ay no more than
<PB N="345" REF="356">
this; all the&s;e Things will extend but to a
few, and la&s;t tho&s;e few but a little while:
The main Body of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in Places
mu&s;t expect either to quit one or the other;
and I wonder, I confe&s;e, to find it &s;o much a
Que&s;tion among them which they &s;hould
do; I hope the Time is coming when it
&s;hall be no more a Que&s;tion, and when Pla|ces,
Profits, Preferments, and Honours, &s;hall
no more &s;tand in Competition with Con|&s;cience,
to the Ruin of the Character, Sin|cerity,
Morals, and Intere&s;t of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI>
in this Nation. This Sincerity, and the
&s;teady Adhering to the Truth of their Prin|ciples
is that which will bring Meat out of
this Eater, and will effectually re&s;tore the
Reputation of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> make their In|tere&s;t
Formidable to their Enemies, Glori|ous
to the <HI>Prote&s;tant Churches,</HI> and give the
greate&s;t Blow to their Enemies who have
contrived this late Oppre&s;&s;ion for their Mor|ti&s;ication
that can po&s;&s;ibly be given.</P>
<P>This leads me to an Ob&s;ervation which I
think is vi&s;ible from the Premi&s;es, and
which, as it is yet but in Pro&s;pect, I have re|&s;erv'd
for this Place, as a Conclu&s;ion to this
Work, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Enemy afore&s;aid will, in
the End, be entirely di&s;appointed in their
Expectations, as to the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> from the
late Re&s;traint laid by them upon <HI>Occa&s;ional
Conformity:</HI> That altho' it is a very great
Blow to the <HI>Di&s;&s;enter's</HI> Intere&s;t for the pre|&s;ent
<PB N="346" REF="357">
and &s;eems to threaten them with a
Breaking of their Party. Subjecting them to
their Enemies, and E&s;tabli&s;hing tho&s;e Ene|mies
in the Oppre&s;&s;ive Power they have &s;o
long labour'd to obtain over the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters;</HI>
Ju&s;t the contrary &s;hall be the Effect, to their
A&s;toni&s;hment, and at la&s;t, to the Confu&s;ion of
tho&s;e Mad-men, and of their Intere&s;t in this
Nation.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> mu&s;t give me Leave
to add one Thing, by Way of Caution, which
I hope &s;hall be back'd with Rea&s;on and Cha|rity,
<HI>viz.</HI> Always provided that the <HI>Di&s;&s;ent|ers</HI>
&s;hall, as I hope they will, alter their
Mea&s;ures, revive the Antient Federal Prin|ciples
of Love, Union, and Concert among
and to one another, that they open their
Hands and enlarge their Principles: I mean
of Charity and Bounty to tho&s;e who are
ready to &s;uffer and &s;acrifice them&s;elves &s;or
their Cau&s;e, and in Defence of Truth; that
they neither drive their Depending Brethren
from them, or di&s;courage others from Em|bracing
a Suffering Party and Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>I cannot but recommend to the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI>
in <HI>England</HI> a certain wonderfully u&s;eful Pa|per,
publi&s;h'd by their Enemy, the <HI>Po&s;t-Boy,</HI>
here, and particularly the Original, exhibi|ted
by a Rank of as inveterate Enemies to
the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> as any in Her Maje&s;ty's Do|minions;
and this is the Repre&s;entation of
the Convocation in <HI>Ireland,</HI> publi&s;h'd in
<PB N="347" REF="358">
<HI>Dublin,</HI> and &s;ent over to Her Maje&s;ty. The
<HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in <HI>England</HI> may learn from this
Paper, what it is alone that will make them
formidasble to their Enemies, encrea&s;e their
Number, and confirm their Intere&s;t. The
<HI>Convocation</HI> complain heavily of the grow|ing
Numbers of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in the <HI>North,</HI>
e&s;pecally of <HI>Ireland: They lament bow for|midable
they are to the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church,
and the Nece&s;&s;ity there is to cru&s;h and re&s;train
them, for Fear of the Overthrow of the Church;
and the Arguments are very forcible, as it mu&s;t
be confe&s;s'd: They are principally drawn from
the Diligence of their Mini&s;ters in Spreading
their Poi&s;on,</HI> (&s;o they call Preaching a <HI>Pro|te&s;tant</HI>
Doctrine) <HI>the univer&s;al Harmony and
Concert in all their Proceedings, one which a|nother;
their Rai&s;ing great Funds to propa|gate
their Intere&s;ly Supporting and Encourag|ing
their own Party and Poor; and which is
&s;till wor&s;e, their Adhering to one another in
Matters of Commerce, Trading with one ano|ther,
and Employing one another, exclu&s;ive of
the Churchmen, whereby</HI> (&s;ay they) <HI>they with
too much Succs&s;s, e&s;tabli&s;h the Faction,</HI> that is
their own <HI>Intere&s;t,</HI> and enrich them&s;elves to
&s;uch a Degree as is dangerous to the Church,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I omit Repeating the re&s;t of their Argu|ments,
tho' many of them are of the like Kind,
but the U&s;e of it is this, that here, as in a
Gla&s;s, the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in <HI>England</HI> may &s;ee
<PB N="348" REF="359">
what is their pre&s;ent Work, what the Duty
of their Profe&s;&s;ion, relatively con&s;ider'd, is, and
what alone can re&s;tore their Circum&s;tances,
<HI>viz.</HI> That they have their Eye a little more
to the general Good of their own Body than
ever yet they have had; laying a&s;ide &s;elfi&s;h
Principles,, Diffidence, and Di&s;tru&s;t of one
another; and act as a Body in Concert with
one another; taking proper Steps to rai&s;e
and recover a Confidence in one another,
and a general Concern for their Common
and Univer&s;al Intere&s;t: As a &s;trict, up|right,
&s;teddy Adhering <HI>to the Principles</HI> of
the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> will give them a Reputation
all over the World, and even with their
Enemies, and will re&s;tore them to the good
Opinion, <HI>not of one another only,</HI> but of all
the World; &s;o a &s;trict Adhering <HI>to the In|tere&s;t</HI>
of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> and Re&s;toring a true
publick Spirit among them, will rai&s;e their
politick Reputation to &s;uch a Degree as it
never yet could arrive to, and make them
too con&s;iderable in the World, to be u&s;ed as
&s;ome People expect to u&s;e them. This ne|ce&s;&s;arily
requires &s;ome Explication, and with
that I &s;hall conclude this Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The Circum&s;tances of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> as to
the late <HI>Occa&s;ional-Bill,</HI> has been already
hinted at, and is well known to the World:
What has brought them to it, is &s;ufficiently
&s;poken to in the foregoing Sheets: <HI>The Que|&s;ion
now is,</HI> What is like to be the Con&s;e|quence
<PB N="349" REF="360">
of the&s;e Things? In which I think
a Man need not &s;earch deep, but he will
evidently &s;ee the&s;e Things.</P>
<P>1. That their Enemies expect their Ruin.</P>
<P>2. That if they manage rightly, the very
Mi&s;chief de&s;ign'd them, may yet be to
their Advantage.</P>
<P>I am far from Defending, or Approving
what is done again&s;t them; neither the Po|licy
or the Morallity of it can be ju&s;ti&s;y'd.
But what &s;hall the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> do? What is
before them? My Hints &s;hall be &s;hort; their
Way is ea&s;y; and they will all own the
Rea&s;onablene&s;s of the Propo&s;al.</P>
<P><HI>Repent and do their fir&s;t Works; Occa&s;io|nal
Conformity</HI> has been the Ruin of their
Intere&s;t; let it now be evident to the World,
that <HI>Con&s;cientious Nonconfomity</HI> is their true
Foundation; let all that can conform, leave
them, and go over to the Church. To the
Churchbmen I will &s;ay, <HI>take them,</HI> and much
Good may they do you: We believe you
have little to boa&s;t of the <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;&s;tical Con|verts</HI>
you have made from the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters:</HI>
Ye dare not give us a Li&s;t of them, and bid
us write their Characters, and then value
your &s;elves upon them: If no better go over
than are yet gone, I mean among the <HI>Mini|&s;ters</HI>
of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> the <HI>Di&s;&s;enting Intere&s;t</HI>
will never feel the Lo&s;s, or <HI>Church</HI> be
able to count their Gain: Nor is there one
True bred <HI>Di&s;&s;enter</HI> to be found among the
<PB N="350" REF="361">
Converts of the la&s;t Ten Years; none but
the Fund-bred, Half-taught Sons of <HI>Charity,</HI>
of whom I have &s;poken before, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;uch as
help'd to be a Scandal to the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> when
they were among them, and will be &s;o to
whom&s;oever they &s;hall joyn; &s;uch as had
not the Education of <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> among the
<HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> been under the unhappy Di&s;cou|ragements
afore&s;aid you had never had, and
if new Mea&s;ures are taken by the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI>
in the Education of their <HI>Mini&s;ters,</HI> you will
get very few more.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> I &s;ay, be not concern'd
at the&s;e Men leaving you; let them go, and
I wi&s;h many more which might be nam'd
would go after them. The Remainder re|fin'd
from this Dro&s;s, purg'd from the&s;e
Dreggs, clear'd of this Scum, would &s;hine the
clearer; Preaching the Go&s;pel would revive
among us; the&s;e fa&s;hionable <HI>Mini&s;ters,</HI> really,
know not what <HI>Preaching the Go&s;pel means;</HI>
they are &s;o afraid of what was called <HI>Cant,</HI>
that they hardly pre&s;erve the Gravity of Stile
in the Pulpit, nay, they altogether &s;hun the
Energy and Force of acceptable Words, and
rather &s;tudy to make a fine Oration than a
plain hone&s;t Sermon: So florid they would
be thought to be, that they affect a Dram|matick
Stile in their Sermons, and bring our
Play-Hou&s;e Phra&s;es into the Language of the
Pulpit, and this they call <HI>Fine Preachings,</HI> of
which I &s;hall give you the ju&s;t Cen&s;ure of a
<PB N="351" REF="362">
very worthy and able Judge, Mr. <HI>Al&s;op,</HI> who
even the <HI>Di&s;&s;nters</HI> Enemies would allow had
as much Wit, and as good Language, as mo&s;t
Men in his Time. He us'd to &s;ay, <HI>Soft, Gay
Words and Satyrical Expre&s;&s;ions were the two
Extreams of Language, and both became a
Writer, but not a Preacher;</HI> and when one told
him he had heard a certain Man preach a
<HI>Fine Seomon: A Fine Sermon! &s;ays</HI> Mr. <HI>Al|&s;op
a Sermon of the</HI> Devil; <HI>this fine Preach|ing
will ruin the</HI> Di&s;&s;enters. Indeed, Mr.
<HI>Al&s;op</HI> Has prov'd too true a Prophet.</P>
<P>Plainne&s;s in Stile, affectionate Delivery,
Preach'd with a Concern for Souls, and with
a Reverence Suitable to the Maje&s;ty of the
Work. The&s;e were the Things Recommen|ded
the Go&s;pel to the la&s;t Age; and this mu&s;t
&s;till be &s;aid, tho' the Ta&s;te of this Age is
Debauch'd by the Frothy <HI>Fluttering,</HI> Empty
<HI>Pulpit-Talk,</HI> which is Cryed up for the <HI>Fine
Preaching</HI> of the Day, as before; yet if a true
Primitive Go&s;pel Preacher happens, from
&s;ome remote Corner, to ri&s;e among us, <HI>as One
from the Dead,</HI> and puts us in mind of the
Manner of our Ance&s;tors, the Excellency is &s;o
Intrin&s;ick, and the Power is &s;o Irri&s;i&s;tible, that
it mu&s;t Force our Approbation; and it does &s;o;
<HI>but then</HI> the People are under a Surprize; they
are affected with it as a kind of Miracle, and
they enquire as Men amaz'd; <HI>ju&s;t as the Jews,
in another Ca&s;e;</HI> is not this &s;uch and &s;uch a
Man? Does he not come out of <HI>Devon&s;hire,
<PB N="352" REF="363" MS="Y">
or Wales, or Lanca&s;hire, or Scotland? Whence
had this Man the&s;e Gifts?</HI> Would God in
Mercy to the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> &s;end among them a
few &s;uch Preachers, as Dr. <HI>Owen,</HI> Mr. <HI>John
Collins,</HI> Dr. <HI>Manton,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Richard,</HI> and
<HI>Jo&s;eph Allen,</HI> Mr. <HI>Flavell,</HI> Dr. <HI>Gilpin,</HI> Mr.
Mead, and the like, how would they re&s;tore
the Ta&s;te of the Hearers of the Town, and
cau&s;e us to Nauceat the Levity and Cold
Declaiming of the Preachers, now ri&s;ing up
among us. If he hath any more Harve&s;t to
Reap in this Vineyard, he will certainly find
Labourers more Suitable, and therefore we
may hope he will in Time do this; but if
the Pre&s;ent Spirit remain both among Mini|&s;ters
and Hearers, I fear this Dreadful Pro|phe&s;ie
of a Decea&s;ed Mini&s;ter among the
<HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> may take Effect in our Age, <HI>(viz.)
That either God will remove this</HI> Generation
<HI>from the Go&s;pel, or the Go&s;pel from</HI> this Ge|neration.</P>
<BIBL>Mat. XIX. 25.</BIBL>
<P>Smite a Scorner, and the Simple will be
ware, and Reproach a Man of Under&s;tanding
and be will under&s;tand Knowledge.</P>
