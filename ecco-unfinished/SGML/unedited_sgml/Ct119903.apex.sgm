<LG>
<L>A Female culprit at your bar appears,</L>
<L>Not de&s;titute of hope, nor free from fears.</L>
<L>Her utmo&s;t crimes &s;he's ready to confe&s;s,</L>
<L>A &s;imple tre&s;pa&s;s&mdash;neither more nor le&s;s;</L>
<L>For, truant-like, &s;he rambled out of bounds,</L>
<L>And dar'd to venture on poetic grounds.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The fault is deem'd high-trea&s;on by the men,</L>
<L>Tho&s;e lordly tyrants who u&s;urp the pen!</L>
<L>Then try the vile monopoly to hide</L>
<L>With flattering arts, 'You, ladies, have be&s;ide</L>
<L>'So many ways to conquer&mdash;&s;ure 'tis fit</L>
<L>'You leave to us that dangerous weapon wit!"</L>
<L>For women, like &s;tate criminals, they think</L>
<L>Should be debarr'd the u&s;e of pen and ink.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our author, who di&s;claims &s;uch partial laws,</L>
<L>To her own &s;ex appeals to judge her cau&s;e.</L>
<L>She pleads old magna charta on her &s;ide,</L>
<L>That Briti&s;h &s;ubjects by their peers be try'd.</L>

<LG>
<L>Ladies, to you &s;he dedicates her lays,</L>
<L>A&s;&s;ert your right to cen&s;ure or to prai&s;e;</L>
<L>Nor doubt a &s;entence by &s;uch lips decreed,</L>
<L>Firm as the laws of Per&s;ian or of Mede;</L>
<L>Boldly your will in open court declare,</L>
<L>And let the men di&s;pute it if they dare.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our humble &s;cenes no charms of art can boa&s;t,</L>
<L>But &s;imple nature, and plain &s;en&s;e at mo&s;t:</L>
<L>Perhaps &s;ome character&mdash;a moral too&mdash;</L>
<L>And what is &s;tranger &s;till&mdash;the &s;tory's new:</L>
<L>No borrow'd thoughts throughout the piece are &s;hewn,</L>
<L>But what our author writes is all her own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>By no &s;ly hint, or incident &s;he tries</L>
<L>To bid on mode&s;t cheeks the blu&s;h ari&s;e:</L>

The loo&s;e&s;t thoughts our decent &s;cenes &s;ugge&s;t,</L>

<L>And where our harmle&s;s &s;atire vents its &s;pleen,</L>
<L>The &s;obere&s;t prude may laugh, without a skreen.</L>
<L>But not to mirth alone we claim your ear,</L>
<L>Some tender &s;cenes demand the melting tear;</L>
<L>The comic dame, her different powers to prove,</L>
<L>Gives you the dear variety you love;</L>
<L>Sometimes a&s;&s;umes her graver &s;i&s;ter's art,</L>
<L>Borrows her form, and tries to touch the heart,</L>
<L>But fancy's pictures float upon the brain,</L>
<L>And &s;hort-liv'd o'er the heart is pa&s;&s;ion's reign,</L>
<L>Till judgment &s;tamp her &s;anction on the whole,</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>HOW's this, madam? pur&s;ue me into my &s;tudy! my &s;anctuary! I thought this place, at lea&s;t, was to be con&s;idered by your Lady|&s;hip as inviolable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope I don't interrupt you, my dear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hould be glad, lady Medway, that we remember'd our re&s;pective bounds. I never intrude at your tea-table or toilet; and I de&s;ire my hours of retirement may be held as &s;a|cred by you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg your pardon, my Lord, but indeed you have made me &s;o exceedingly unhappy by this &s;udden re&s;olution you have taken, in regard to marrying your daughter, that I can find re&s;t no where.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>And &s;o you are come, like the evil &s;pirit, to take po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of me, in order to make me as re&s;tle&s;s as your&s;elf. I am really extremely obliged to your Lady&s;hip; but you mu&s;t know, ma'am, I am of &s;o &s;trange a di&s;po&s;ition, that I have an ab&s;olute di&s;like to the being made unea&s;y; and therefore &s;hall take it as a favour, if you will either, at once, chearfully acqui|e&s;ce in what I have determined, or el&s;e go, and di&s;play your
<PB N="6" REF="50">
plaintive eloquence to &s;ome one better di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ympathize with you than I am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, you know your will has ever been a law to me; but I beg of you to con&s;ider the cruelty of forcing young people to marry again&s;t their inclinations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, I did not <HI>expect</HI> this idle oppo&s;ition from you, e&s;pecially when you know my motives to this marriage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, you have not yet explained them to me; I can only gue&s;s at large.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know I am hara&s;&s;ed with debts, and I now tell you, I don't know where to rai&s;e five hundred pounds more, if it would &s;ave me from perdition; and pray, let me ask your Lady&s;hip, do you know any one be&s;ides Sir Anthony Branville, who will take your daughter without a fortune? for I neither am, nor probably ever &s;hall be, able to give her one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>But Loui&s;a is very young, my Lord; why need we be &s;o precipitate? Be&s;ides, if this match between Mrs. Knight|ly and your &s;on &s;hould take place, it will then be in your pow|er to provide for your daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right <HI>woman!&mdash;</HI>a hint is but ju&s;t &s;tarted, and you pur&s;ue, run it down, and &s;eize it at once. I have not yet pro|po&s;ed the thing to my &s;on. Perhaps he may not like the lady when I do; and I pre&s;ume you will think <HI>his</HI> inclinations as proper to be con&s;ulted, as tho&s;e of the young lady his &s;i&s;ter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, my Lord,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh no doubt on't; love-matches again&s;t the world! All you ladies, in this particular, are very ready to adhere to that chri&s;tian precept, of doing as you would be done by: and &s;o I &s;uppo&s;e, you, out of your maternal fondne&s;s, would re|commend it to me to let Mi&s;s plea&s;e her&s;elf in the choice of a husband, as her mamma did before her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>That reproach from <HI>$ou,</HI> my Lord, is not kind&mdash;but I do not de&s;ire you to let her plea&s;e her&s;elf in chu&s;ing one &s;he likes, only do not force her to take one &s;he hates.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Has &s;he told you that &s;he hates Sir Anthony?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in expre&s;s words; but the repugnance &s;he &s;hews&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps &s;he loves &s;ome one el&s;e.&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="60">
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>To tell you the truth, my Lord, I believe &s;he does.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>And &s;he has made you the confident of her tender pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>I extorted &s;omething like a confe&s;&s;ion of this &s;ort from her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray who may be the happy man?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Young Branville, Sir Anthony's nephew, who is now on his travels, and is expected every day home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>A forward little gip&s;ey&mdash;This is the cur&s;e of mar|rying early, to have our children tugging at our pur&s;e-&s;trings, at a time when we have as quick a reli&s;h for the joys of life as they have, and ten times a better capacity for pur&s;uing them.&mdash;Look'ee, madam, I cannot give her a &s;hilling; Sir Antho|ny is ready to take her as &s;he is; and if they &s;hould have a fa|mily, is able to provide liberally for them all. On the con|trary, if &s;he follows her own &s;oft inclinations, in marrying Mr. Branville, I &s;uppo&s;e, in three or four years, I &s;hould have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing my&s;elf a grand papa to two or three pretty little beggars, who, between their mother's vanity, and their father's poverty, may happen to continue &s;o all their lives.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, my Lord, as Sir Anthony has &s;ent his nephew a|broad at his own expence, it looks as if he meant to do &s;ome|thing hand&s;ome for him: be&s;ides, he is his uncle's heir in ca&s;e he &s;hould die without children by marriage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>And &s;o you think you can keep him in a &s;tate of ce|libacy, by refu&s;ing him your daughter&mdash;Oh fy, Lady Med|way, I never heard you argue &s;o weakly. Sir Anthony is not yet pa&s;t the prime of life; be&s;ides, he has owned to me that it was his being di&s;carded by Mrs. Knightly, which made him re&s;olve, at once, in a &s;ort of pique, to marry the fir&s;t girl that fell in his way; birth and reputation being all the fortune he de&s;ired with her. A man thus circum&s;tanced, is very little like|ly to continue a batchelor&mdash;No, no, I'll take him in the hu|mour, and &s;ecure him while I may.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Before it be too late, my Lord, let me once more be|&s;eech you to reflect on the mi&s;ery of a married life, where on either &s;ide love or e&s;teem is wanting. Have we not a glaring
<PB N="8" REF="70">
in&s;tance of this in the hou&s;e with us, in Sir Harry Flutter and his wife? are they not as wretched a pair as ever met in wed|lock, perpetually quarrelling! I own, I almo&s;t repent my in|vitation to them, and wi&s;h them fairly back again in the coun|try.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>That mu&s;t not be. <STAGE>(A&s;ide.)</STAGE> You have made a very unlucky choice in your example, ma'am; a fooli&s;h boy, and a giddy girl, that know not either of them what they would be at. He married the wife his mother cho&s;e for him, to get rid of his tutor; and &s;he took the husband her wife father pro|vided for her, to e&s;cape from a boarding &s;chool. What can be expected from two &s;uch &s;impletons? He, proud of the au|thority of a husband, exerci&s;es it from the &s;ame principle, and with pretty much the &s;ame capacity, that children &s;hew with regard to poor little animals that are in their power, in teaz|ing and controlling them; and this he thinks makes him look manly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I imagine, for I have heard him &s;ay, he does no more than other husbands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>She, on the other hand, fancies the prerogatives of a wife con&s;i&s;t in contradicting and oppo&s;ing him; and this, I pre&s;ume, &s;he thinks is doing like other wives: but my life for it, when they know a little more of the world, they will be very happy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never in each other, I am afraid, my Lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, ma'am, let me ask you, what mighty feli|city have you enjoyed, in being married to the man of your choice?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a &s;trange que&s;tion, my Lord! I never com|plained of my lot; but if I have not been completely happy, it is not owing to any fault of mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be mine for ought I know&mdash;but I only mention it, to &s;hew you that <HI>love</HI> is not &s;uch an almighty deity, as to confer happine&s;s without certain ingredients be&s;ides, that I could name.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, where it is reciprocal, there wants not much be&s;ides.</P>
</SP>

<PB N="9" REF="80">
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be &s;ure you preach that wi&s;e doctrine to your daugh|ter; it will become your prudence, and no doubt will be ex|tremely agreeable to her pretty romantic notions&mdash;But pr'ythee let us have done with the &s;ubject at once. One cir|cum&s;tance more, however, I &s;hall acquaint you with; if the marriage between Medway and this lady &s;hould be accom|pli&s;hed, I have other purpo&s;es to appropriate her fortune to, than buying a husband for your daughter&mdash;But this is only in &s;peculation&mdash;the thing may never happen&mdash;for nothing but the la&s;t extremity &s;hould compel me to urge my &s;on again&s;t his inclination. In regard to Loui&s;a, in two words, I <HI>will</HI> be obeyed: do me the favour to tell her as much. I &s;hall &s;ee her pre&s;ently, and expect &s;uch an an&s;wer from her, as her du|ty &s;hall dictate.</P>

<P>No faith, only at the tavern. I was at home before three o'clock, and yet my wife was &s;uch an unrea&s;on|able little devil, as to ask me forty que&s;tions about my &s;tay|ing out &s;o late.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>It's the way of them all&mdash;but I hope you are too well acquainted with your own prerogative, to give her any &s;atisfaction on tho&s;e accounts.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Satisfaction! ho catch me at that, and gibbet me&mdash;no, no&mdash;But pray now, my Lord, how would you be|have on &s;uch an occa&s;ion? for I &s;hould be very glad to find that my conduct &s;quared with yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why&mdash;not roughly&mdash;you know that is not my way&mdash;it is not manly; be&s;ides, it would at once provoke, and ju&s;tify your wife in her re&s;entment.&mdash;But there is a &s;ort of &s;neering, ironical treatment, that I never knew fail of nettling a woman to the quick; and the be&s;t of it is, the thing won't <HI>bear</HI> repetition; for let <HI>them</HI> deliver your very words, without the tone and air accompanying them, and there &s;hall not ap|pear the lea&s;t harm in them.</P>

<SP>

<P>Why, I came home at three o'clock, as I told you, a little tip&s;y too, by the by; but what was that to her,
<PB N="11" REF="100">
you know, for I am always good humoured in my cups? To bed I crept, as &s;oftly as a mou&s;e, for I had no more thought of quarrelling with her then, than I have now with your Lord|&s;hip&mdash;La, &s;ays &s;he, with a great heavy &s;igh, it is a &s;ad thing that one mu&s;t be di&s;turbed in this manner; and on &s;he went, mutter, mutter, mutter, for a quarter of an hour; I all the while lying as quiet as a lamb, without making her a word of an&s;wer; at la&s;t, quite tired of her perpetual <HI>buzzing</HI> in my ear, Pr'ythee be quiet, Mrs. Wa&s;p, &s;ays I, and let me &s;leep (I was not thoroughly awake when I &s;poke.) Do &s;o, Mr. <HI>Drone,</HI> grumbled &s;he, and gave a great flounce. I &s;aid no more, for in two minutes I was as fa&s;t as a top. Ju&s;t now, when I came down to breakfa&s;t, &s;he was &s;eated at the tea|table all alone, and looked &s;o neat, and &s;o cool, and &s;o pret|ty, that e'gad, not thinking of what had pa&s;&s;ed, I was going to give her a ki&s;s; when up &s;he to&s;s'd her demore little face, You were a pretty fellow, la&s;t night, Sir Harry. &s;ays &s;he: So I am every night, I hope, ma'am, &s;ays I, making her a low bow.

Oh, thought I, I'll match you for your enquiries; I nam'd your Lord&s;hip, and half a dozen more wild fellows, (whom, by the way, I had not &s;o much as &s;een) and two or three girls of the town, added I, whi&s;tling, and looking another way&mdash;</P>

<P>Why really, Sir Harry, I pity you; to be ty'd to &s;uch a little termagant is the devil; but 'tis the fortune of wedlock.

'Twas my own ca&s;e at fir&s;t; but I was &s;oon obliged to alter my cour&s;e, and by exerting my&s;elf a little, I brought Lady Medway to be as well-behaved, I think, as any woman of quality in town.</P>

If &s;he pouts, &s;mile; and a&s;k her how &s;he likes your new &s;word-knot, or the point in your ruffles, or any o|ther idle que&s;tion. You know &s;he mu&s;t give you an an&s;wer. If it be a peevi&s;h one, laugh in her face, take up your hat, and wi&s;h her a good morning; if on the contrary, &s;he &s;peaks with good humour, &s;eem not to hear her, but walk about the room, repeating ver&s;es. Then, as if you had not ob&s;erved her before, Did you &s;peak to me, Lady Flutter? but without wait|ing for her reply, &s;lide out of the room, humming a tune&mdash;Now all this, you &s;ee, were &s;he to relate it, will not have the appearance of ill treatment; and yet my life for yours, it humbles her more than all the blu&s;tering airs you could put on.</P>

<P>Oh my &s;weet friend, that que&s;tion has made me &s;erious all at once. I can laugh at Sir Anthony no more; I have not lately had &s;pirits enough to be diverted with him, and for that rea&s;on, tried to &s;hake him off. I don't know what to think of the Colonel. I came here this evening on purpo&s;e to con&s;ult you. My Lord, who, I perceive, is a man of the world, and full of de&s;ign, dropped &s;ome hints to me about his &s;on, by which I find the thing would at lea&s;t be very agreeable to <HI>him;</HI> yet the Colonel has not been near me &s;ince.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, my dear Clara, the&s;e fears of yours reproach, at the &s;ame time that they flatter me. Is it nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould tell you, over and over again, for the thou&s;andth time, that I never can love any woman but your&s;elf?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Believe me, you have no rea&s;on; for, though no &s;on was ever more ob&s;ervant of a father's will than I have always been of his; yet, in the particular concerns of my heart, I mu&s;t be my own director. This my father knows, and I hope he will never urge me more upon the &s;ubject.</P>

<P>Oh, not for the world!&mdash;I am a&s;hamed of doubting, and yet I don't know how it is, I am full of appre|hen&s;ions: the truth is, I am not very happy at home; my &s;i&s;|ter is, of late, grown cold and peevi&s;h to me&mdash;I never &s;u&s;|pected the cau&s;e before, but 'tis now too plain.</P>

<P>You &s;hall not long be &s;ubject to her tyranny. My fa|ther already knows the &s;ecret of my love; and I think that, notwith&s;tanding the article of fortune weighs much with him, his regard to my happine&s;s will even out balance that.</P>

<P>His <HI>de&s;igns</HI> on <HI>me!</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, madam, his cruel, his (I grieve to &s;ay) infamous de&s;igns on you. Oh, Lady Flutter, you &s;tand on a dreadful precipice! do not reject the kind hand that would &s;natch you from certain ruin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is &s;uch extraordinary language, Lady Medway, that really&mdash;I don't know what to &s;ay to it&mdash;I little imagined I &s;hould have created any jealou&s;y when I came into your family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, my dear, you entirely mi&s;take my motive. I own there was a time when I might have been influenced by jealou&s;y, but I have out-lived it; and am not now actuated by &s;o &s;elfi&s;h a pa&s;&s;ion. Pity to your inexperienced youth, friend|&s;hip to your worthy parents, regard to the honour of your hu&s;|band, joined to the tenderne&s;s and duty I owe my Lord, are the &s;ole motives which urge me to &s;ave you all, if po&s;&s;ible, from ruin. I know my Lord makes love to you; and that you have, unwarily, been drawn in to make an a&s;&s;ignation with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>If he has been &s;o treacherous as to tell this!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has not, I a&s;&s;ure you; yet I am certain of the fact; I know too well the nature of his connections with Lady Love|grove&mdash;And now, my dear, if you would e&s;cape the &s;nare
<PB N="54" REF="530">
which is laid for your undoing, be advi&s;ed by me, who am your true friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't think I have a friend in the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are mi&s;taken; I am &s;incerely &s;o. My Lord is a man of plea&s;ure, and is perhaps le&s;s &s;crupulous in affairs of gallantry, than in any other vice. Your youth and agreeable per&s;on were alone &s;ufficient to attract him; but when &s;uperad|ded to this, he found you de&s;pi&s;ed your hu&s;band, and made no difficulty of owning it to him, it almo&s;t amounted to an in|vitation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>An invitation, Lady Medway! you u&s;e me very ill.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>To a man of his ca&s;t, madam, it certainly does. Your unacquaintedne&s;s with men of intrigue makes you blind to your own danger; but indeed, Lady Flutter, there is but one &s;tep between you and inevitable &s;hame and mi&s;ery. What do you think mu&s;t be the con&s;equence, if Sir Harry &s;hould di&s;|cover that you have appointed a private place of meeting with my Lord? What mu&s;t he think of the nature of a corre&s;pon|dence thus meanly carried on by &s;tealth? A&s;k your own heart if you can ju&s;tify this to your hu&s;band and to your friends?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord ble&s;s me, Lady Medway!&mdash;you terri|fy me&mdash;I am amazed how you came to the knowledge of this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis a happine&s;s to you, madam, that I have, if by it I can be the means of &s;aving you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own I was a fool for con&s;enting; but &s;ure, madam, you won't be &s;o barbarons as to tell Sir Harry; it would give him &s;uch an advantage over me, I can't bear the thoughts of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why really, my dear, I &s;hould be &s;orry to be under the nece&s;&s;ity of taking &s;o di&s;agreeable a &s;tep; and if I thought I could rely on your honour and di&s;cretion, in your future con|duct, I certainly &s;hould keep your &s;ecret.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, I'll quit your hou&s;e directly, if that will &s;atisfy you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means, madam; how would you an&s;wer that to your friends, if they &s;hould enquire the rea&s;on? Here you
<PB N="55" REF="540">
came to town to &s;tay the winter with me, and before a month's elap&s;ed you quit my hou&s;e!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I can tell them that Sir Harry is &s;o in|&s;ufferable, I can't live with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you will be ruled by me, Lady Flutter, for one week, nay but for three days, I'll engage that Sir Harry and you &s;hall be as happy a couple as any in England.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh gracious! you could as &s;oon convert us into angels.</P>

<P>But will you promi&s;e to be guided by me, but for a little while?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>O dear Lady Medway, I know you would recommend patience and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and all that; but I ne|ver can, nor ever will &s;ubmit to his humour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, madam, I &s;hall think it my duty to write to your father immediately, and let him know the danger of your &s;ituation; for though I am &s;ure the parting you from your husband would afflict him, yet 'tis better he &s;hould receive you while you are innocent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is it you would have me do, madam?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your task is not hard, if you are di&s;po&s;ed to &s;et a|bout it. You are married to a very young man, Lady Flutter; who, though he is warm and volatile, does not want &s;en&s;e, and I am &s;ure is good-natured in the main.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Flutter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Lady Medway&mdash;you are enough to turn one's brain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hear me out, madam. You, on the other hand, who have as much &s;en&s;e, and as much good-nature as he, are at the &s;ame time a little too quick and impatient of contradiction. He I will allow is too ready to <HI>give</HI> offence; but you in your turn mu&s;t grant, that you are as &s;udden in <HI>taking</HI> it. Now, my dear, 'tis in your power, and give me leave to tell you, 'tis your duty al&s;o, to correct yours. And I'll an&s;wer for it that Sir Harry will follow your lead; for I am &s;ure that he loves you a great deal better than my Lord does, let him tell you what he plea&s;es.</P>

My Lord, I beg your pardon; but you have wrung my very heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you have wrung mine&mdash;for, Medway, with equal grief and &s;hame I &s;peak it, I <HI>have</HI> made you a beggar; I have mortgaged the la&s;t foot of land I was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of in the world, and the only pro&s;pect I had of redeeming it, was by this lady's fortune; that would have recovered all, and re&s;tored you to the e&s;tate of your ance&s;tors. I thought a boyi&s;h pa&s;&s;i|on might have been overcome, when &s;uch important motives for it were united, as your own intere&s;t, and the honour of your family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>As for my own intere&s;t, my Lord, it is but a feather in the &s;cale; and for the re&s;t, I think my own honour (which you your&s;elf taught me to prize) is more concerned in this event, than that of my family can po&s;&s;ibly be.</P>

clo&s;et, under great agitation, on account of the letter you had written to her &s;i&s;ter.&mdash;I pleaded for you, but found her a|ver&s;e and cold.&mdash;In a little pau&s;e of di&s;cour&s;e, I happened to ca&s;t my eyes on the picture of a lady, which hung ju&s;t before me, and was &s;truck with the re&s;emblance of a beauty whom, in my early days, I loved, and cruelly betrayed.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>The &s;ame&mdash;I thought the injured countenance &s;eem|ed to frown upon me. Surprized at the &s;ight, I ha&s;tily de|manded who&s;e the picture was, and was told by Mrs. Knight|ly 'twas her mother's.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, 'twas nothing to what I &s;uffered after, when farther urging her to &s;atisfy my curio&s;ity, &s;he told me her mother's name and family! The apparent confu&s;ion this threw me into, rouzed her in her turn to ask me &s;ome que|&s;tions, which brought about this amazing explanation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>She could not know you by your name, my Lord, as it was &s;ince my birth you a&s;&s;umed <HI>that</HI> with the title of Med|way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>True.&mdash;She had heard of me by my own family name, and asked me, with a faultering voice, whether I had not formerly been at Lisbon, and borne the name of Selby. My acknowledging that I had, threw her into agonies, from which I, with difficulty, recovered her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you never know, my Lord, that you had a daugh|ter by that Lady?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh no, no! I was recalled to England early in my amour with her. I married &s;oon after my return, and, thoughtle&s;s and young as I then was, never enquired after her more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>How then, my Lord, can you be certain of this fact?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Medway! by too &s;ure an evidence&mdash;The pe|nitence and deep remor&s;e of a dying woman! The unhappy lady confe&s;&s;ed the &s;ecret, with all its circum&s;tances, to this her daughter, when &s;he was on her death-bed.</P>

<P>Mrs. Knightly, then, had pa&s;&s;ed for Mr. Richly's daughter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>She had; the match between him and her mother was ha&s;tily concluded by her friends, immediately after my departure. At the time of this lady's birth, Mr. Richly was ab&s;ent on his affairs in the Indies; and tho' &s;he came into the world in le&s;s than &s;even months after the marriage, yet (this circum&s;tance being carefully concealed from him) he never doubted of her being his own.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was the cau&s;e which wrung the &s;ecret from her dying mother's brea&s;t. Her decea&s;ed husband had, through a partial fondne&s;s for his &s;uppo&s;ed elde&s;t daughter, left her &s;uch a di&s;proportionate &s;hare of his wealth; and the mother, in divulging the &s;ecret, charged Mrs. Knightly, with her la&s;t breath, to do ju&s;tice to her &s;i&s;ter. This &s;he her&s;elf, in the hurry of her &s;hame, &s;urprize, and grief, acknowledged to me.</P>

<P>I long to know, my Lord, what re&s;ulted from this ex|traordinary interview.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mrs. Knightly's agitations are not to be de&s;cribed. She wept and wrung her hands. I mixed my tears with her's; and, while &s;he fell on her knees before me, I involuntarily dropped on one of mine, and begged of her to accept a ble&s;|&s;ing from her repentant father. She &s;trained me to her bo|&s;om; then ri&s;ing with a noble air, &s;he made a &s;orrowful and &s;ilent motion with her hand that I &s;hould leave her. I did &s;o; and ha&s;tened home, to brood over my own reflections&mdash;Oh &s;uch reflections! &s;uch reflections, George!</P>
