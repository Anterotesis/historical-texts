</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>'P&s;ha, is that all? &mdash; A Mu&s;ical Lady! I would as &s;oon take the Savoyard girl for a wife, with no other portion than her cymbal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MASK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but my mi&s;tre&s;s's lyre is &s;trung with gold, you know. Thirty thou&s;and in her own di&s;po&s;al! Be&s;ides, I dare &s;ay this pa&s;&s;ion for mu&s;ic is but one of the irregular appetites of virginity: You hardly ever knew a lady &s;o devoted to her harp&s;ichord, but &s;he &s;uffered it to go out of tune after matri|mony.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="12">
<SPEAKER>FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is all mighty pretty in theory&mdash;But even &s;uppo&s;ing that you can &s;o ea&s;ily reconcile your|&s;elf to all her airs and crotchets, I &s;ee very little pro&s;pect of her being &s;o enamoured of you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MASK.</SPEAKER>
<P>To the very brink of de&s;peration and matrimony.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! marry you? She never will, depend on it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MASK.</SPEAKER>
<P>O you're mi&s;taken&mdash;You have too high an opinion of her under&s;tanding, and too mean a one of mine. Sophy is like one of her own in&s;truments: It requires &s;ome &s;kill to manage her, I confe&s;s. But I am a connoi&s;&s;eur in the art, and know every one of her &s;tops.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her &s;tops? ha! ha! &mdash;That would be a mighty pretty conceit, if you was to carry on your court&s;hip in mu&s;ic.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MASK.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why not? Love, perhaps, may as well be &s;ung as &s;aid, and is hardly more ridiculous one way than the other; not to mention that it is the only way of &s;ucceeding with Sophy. It is true indeed that notwith&s;tanding her rage after the gamut, &s;he knows little more of mu&s;ic than I do; yet I am &s;o well convinced of the violence of her attachment to every thing that is Mu&s;ical and Italian, that I &s;hould hardly be &s;urprized at her marriage with one of the <HI>Sopranos</HI> at the opera.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="13">
<SPEAKER>FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay,&mdash;but as I take it, Ma&s;k, you have no opera talents. You can neither &s;ing, play, nor talk Italian.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MASK.</SPEAKER>
<P>No&mdash;but I can admire a fine finger, and be in raptures at an air or a chorus; and as for Italian, I have ju&s;t gleaned enough of the language to &s;prinkle my conver&s;ation with it, as readily as many a fa&s;hionable coxcomb, who has made the tour of Italy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>So your principal recommendations are nece&s;&s;ity and the <HI>bon front</HI>&mdash;Hey! George! &mdash; Well, &s;uc|ce&s;s attend you!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MASK.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you, I am &s;ure of her. I have made &s;ome pretty intelligible overtures to her already, which have been received not unfavourably. I have play|ed off the complete virtuo&s;o upon her, and &s;he &s;up|po&s;es me to be very lately returned from Rome. I have been thrown into raptures and mu&s;ical ex|ta&s;ies&mdash;and cried out <HI>bravo! divino!</HI> and <HI>an|cora!</HI> louder than her&s;elf. But that which, I plainly perceive, weighs mo&s;t with her is a ridiculous pro|po&s;al I have made to carry her over to Italy directly after our marriage. In &s;hort, I have touched the principal &s;tring, the ma&s;ter key of her &s;oul. Nay, &s;he has even declared that I am a <HI>bell' cavaliero</HI>, and a per&s;on of infinite <HI>gu&s;to</HI>&mdash;What do you think of that, Freeman?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I think the only thing you have to do is to follow her up with &s;pirit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="14">
<SPEAKER>MASK.</SPEAKER>
<P>And &s;o I have&mdash;nay I have even gone &s;o far, as to frighten her with the apprehen&s;ions of lo&s;ing me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>A dreadful &s;entence!&mdash;But how?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MASK.</SPEAKER>
<P>By a pretended match with a lady in the country, which, I have told her, my father is determined to force me into; and that I expect him in town every day to conclude the bu&s;ine&s;s with his coun&s;el.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Make ha&s;te then, and conclude your own bu&s;i|ne&s;s with her before he really arrives. Why don't you vi&s;it her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MASK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Vi&s;it her! So I have again and again. I am honour|ed with her particular commands for this very morn|ing: and did not doubt of making this my la&s;t vi&s;it. &mdash;But &s;ome &s;mall impediments, I was afraid, would have prevented my waiting on her.&mdash;For this week pa&s;t, my affairs have been, as you may per|ceive, in &s;ome little confu&s;ion&mdash;I, you &s;ee, am rather in di&s;habille.&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FREEMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha! This is, altogether, as droll an amour, and as whim&s;ical a piece of court&s;hip, as ever I heard of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MASK.</SPEAKER>
<P>So much the better. The oddity of it charms me. I hate your Strephons and Chloes, your &s;en|timental

<P>See new, how ea&s;y it is to impo&s;e on you. He is as great a cheat as my&s;elf. This is no &s;ignor Ro&s;ini! but hone&s;t Jack Ro&s;in, from <HI>Comus</HI> his court;&mdash;one of the choice &s;pirits,&mdash;the chief leader in all MY <HI>concertos</HI>, and by my direction he crept into your pay as &s;ignor <HI>Ro&s;ini</HI>.</P>

<P>Indeed! I mu&s;t fairly own that this la&s;t circum|&s;tance mortifies me, and makes me more a&s;hamed of my mu&s;ical attachment than all the re&s;t.&mdash;&mdash;To be duped by Mr. Ro&s;in, is too palpable a weakne&s;s not to be repented! But now, Sir, if I con&s;ent to lower my note, (to make u&s;e of a mu&s;ical phra&s;e once more) may I not hope that you will lower your note too?</P>

<P>In every particular that does not hurt your fortune, or injure your character, you &s;hall find me the tendere&s;t and mo&s;t compliant of hu&s;bands. And now, Sophy, do but chearful$y re&s;ign this one foible, we &s;hall be the happie&s;t couple in Great Britain.&mdash; And though there has been &s;ome little di&s;cord be|tween us at fir&s;t, we &s;hall agree for the future as well as ba&s;s and treble.&mdash;And give me leave to congratulate you, that in&s;tead of <HI>Signor</HI> MASQUALI, you have got hone&s;t GEORGE MASK.</P>
