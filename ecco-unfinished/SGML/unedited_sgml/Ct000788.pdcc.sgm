<L>STRANGE there's &s;uch magic virtue in a name,</L>
<L>Which deals out cen&s;ure, or di&s;pen&s;es fame!</L>
<L>And that a <HI>taking</HI> title tends to rai&s;e</L>

<L>Some cry, "Corruption undermines a Nation,"</L>

<L>Poor Lady Muzzy can't a dram endure;</L>
<L>Quite faints at <HI>brandy,</HI> but can &s;ip&mdash;<HI>Liqueur.</HI></L>
<L>Thus, a mere name can gild a nau&s;eous pill,</L>
<L>En&s;lave our Rea&s;on, and direct our Will!</L>
<L>Since wide extends this empire of caprice,</L>
<L>Our Author, &s;urely, has mi&s;call'd his Piece!</L>
<L>"The FAMILY PARTY!" cries Sir Squander Da&s;h,</L>
<L>"Oh, 'tis &s;ome wretched matrimonial ha&s;h,</L>
<L>"Where two poor Devils whine and mope together,</L>
<L>"Loll&mdash;pick their teeth&mdash;look glum&mdash;and blame the "weather."</L>
<L>As Lady Li&s;tle&s;s with her &s;po&s;o &s;its,</L>
<L>Stares full at nothing&mdash;nods, and &s;tarts by fits:</L>
<L>While her <HI>gay</HI> Lord reclin'd on &s;ofa, lies!</L>
<L>Twirls round his watch-key&mdash;yawns and rubs his eyes.</L>
<L>De&s;cending from the Great&mdash;&s;uppo&s;e we pop</L>
<L>Into the &s;nug back-parlour thro' the &s;hop,</L>
<L><PB REF="3">Where a faint twilight o'er the dingy room,</L>
<L>Peeps from the dirty pane's congenial gloom;</L>
<L>Old Grub, with warm plaid gown and velvet cap,</L>
<L>With <HI>Dearee</HI> takes his after-dinner nap:</L>
<L>Who joins in uni&s;on the <HI>&s;ocial</HI> doze,</L>
<L>And &s;nores re&s;pon&s;ive to his vocal no&s;e!</L>
<L>In bounces Mi&s;s from &s;chool&mdash;&s;lap goes the door&mdash;</L>
<L>Shook from the peg and rumpled on the floor,</L>
<L>Down drops Papa's be&s;t wig&mdash;&s;o &s;pruce, &s;o neat!</L>
<L>Fre&s;h oil'd and powder'd for&mdash;churchwarden's &s;eat!</L>
<L>Papa growls, but Mamma attends all glee,</L>
<L>While Mi&s;s to crack'd guittar, &s;qualls "Chere amie."</L>
<L>Pleas'd, cries Mamma, "What think ye, if to-day</L>
<L>"We take our Bet&s;y with us to the Play?</L>
<L>"The bill of fare be&s;peaks a welcome hearty,</L>
<L>"Snug too, and &s;ociable&mdash;The FAMILY PARTY."</L>
<L>"The FAMILY PARTY! hold your tongue," &s;ays he,</L>
<L>"The very name, egad's, enough for me!</L>
<L>"I'm for what's new&mdash;no need abroad to roam</L>

<L>Marks for her own, each Party <HI>en famille:</HI></L>

<L>Bring Candour with you, a mo&s;t welcome gue&s;t,</L>

<P>PREFACES have been generally con&s;idered as Prologues to the Reader; and various have been the methods made u&s;e of in them, to depre|cate the cen&s;ure, and conciliate the favour of the Public. The&s;e have been long &s;ince, as Chaucer &s;ays, <HI>"bolted to the bran;"</HI> nor would the Author of this dramatic trifle have adopted the practice on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, did it not give him an oppor|tunity of acknowledging, that the very flattering reception it obtained on the Stage, was greatly to be a&s;cribed to the inimitable performance of Mr. J.

<P>Ha! if I can believe my eyes&mdash;my old Eton friend, Jack Spriggins!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Young Spriggins.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>My friend Rampart! to &s;ee you at Bath is fortunate indeed! But why need you doubt the evidence of your eye-&s;ight?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="9">
<SPEAKER><HI>Rampart.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, as SOME of my &s;en&s;es have deceived me, I didn't know whether the re&s;t might not be equally fallible; I THOUGHT I &s;aw you alight at the Hotel, but was informed that there was no &s;tranger ju&s;t arrived but a Mr. Belmont.</P>

<P>O, I can explain this &s;eeming incon&s;i&s;|tency!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rampart.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What, you are ju&s;t come from Cambridge to &s;tay <HI>out</HI> a thirty-pound quarterage, and have taken Belmont for a travelling name&mdash;being more genteel than that of Jack Spriggins?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Y. Sprig.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, I was going to tell&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rampart.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Or is it that your mode&s;ty &s;hrinks from too much popularity, and you're afraid of being tapped on the &s;houlder by a FRIEND, who&s;e acquaintance you mayn't &s;o ea&s;ily SHAKE OFF?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Y. Sprig.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, faith, 'twas neither pride nor roguery, though, I grant you, they BOTH &s;ometimes a&s;&s;i&s;t the creation of new titles.&mdash;You recollect my attachment to my cou&s;in Laura?&mdash;My father now urges me to marry the old Widow Wheezy, and &s;o &s;ent me to Cam|bridge to break off my former connection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rampart.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but what brings you to Bath?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Y. Sprig.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The &s;ight of my Laura's name in the new&s;|papers among the ARRIVALS. So I in&s;tantly followed her, called my&s;elf Belmont, le&s;t my father (who is &s;nug at his &s;hop in the country) might &s;ee my name in the papers too, and, by joining us, make it rather too much of a FAMILY PARTY.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rampart.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;he is &s;ent here to lo&s;e the idea of your &s;weet per&s;on&mdash;and while you are de&s;cribing the circles of a ball room, your father thinks you are de&s;cribing the circles of Euclid.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Rampart.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Forgot! Why, I was a whole year at Cam|bridge, except that part of it that I was RUSTICATED, and &s;o took lodgings in Covent Garden, and attended too, all the philo&s;ophical lectures&mdash;at Newmarket!&mdash; But what is your pre&s;ent plan of operations?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Y. Sprig.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>THAT I leave to an abler engineer than my&s;elf; no le&s;s a man than Pinch, our College hair-dre&s;&s;er, whom I have brought here with me as a tempo|rary valet. He has been in &s;o many different &s;ituations of life, that he can a&s;&s;ume any form with the greate&s;t facility.</P>

<P>But what made him give up his College bu&s;ine&s;s to follow&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Y. Sprig.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why you mu&s;t know, the only &s;chool that Pinch is attached to, is the EPICUREAN; and a late Edict, forbidding good eating, went again&s;t both his philo&s;ophy and his &s;tomach.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER><HI>Rampart.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Pinch.</HI></SPEAKER>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rampart.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What connection could there&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="12">
<SPEAKER><HI>Pinch.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A very clear one&mdash;for many of his cu&s;tomers had no head for a book, but they all had a head for a hat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rampart.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That indeed&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Pinch.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>So my father would fain have bred me both an apothecary and undertaker, that I might have play'd into my own hands&mdash;but my mother thought there was a trick in THOSE trades, and &s;o would have me&mdash;an attorney.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Pinch.</HI></SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER><HI>Rampart.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No uncommon ca&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Pinch.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I then went into the phy&s;ical line; for I had got a &s;mattering of farriery, and produc'd a univer&s;al medicine; but after having &s;pent all my time in writing letters of gratitude to my&s;elf, and my money, in pro|curing their in&s;ertion in the papers&mdash;my medicine would not take.</P>
