<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what has been the matter, Sir Jacob?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jacob.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There has, Major, been here an impudent pill-monger, who has dar'd to &s;candalize the whole body of the bench.</P>

<P>In&s;olent companion! had I been here, I would have mittimus'd the ra&s;cal at once.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, he wanted the Major more than the magi&s;trate; a few &s;mart &s;trokes from your cane would have fully an|&s;wer'd the purpo&s;e.&mdash;Well, Major, our wars are done; the rattling drum, and &s;queaking fife, now wound our ears no more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>True, Sir Jacob, our corps is di&s;|embodied, &s;o the French may &s;leep in &s;e|curity.</P>
</SP>

<PB N="8" REF="10">
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But, Major, was it not rather late in life for you, to enter upon the profe&s;|&s;ion of arms?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A little aukward in the begin|ning, Sir Jacob: The great difficulty they had was, to get me to turn out my toes; but u&s;e, u&s;e reconciles all them kind of things: Why, after my fir&s;t campaign, I no more minded the noi&s;e of the guns than a flea-bite.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No. There is more made of the&s;e matters than they merit. For the ge|neral good indeed, I am glad of the peace; but as to my &s;ingle &s;elf&mdash;&mdash;And yet, we have had &s;ome de&s;perate duty, Sir Jacob.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! &s;uch marchings and coun|ter-marchings from Brentford to Elin, from Elin to Acton, from Acton to Uxbridge: The du&s;t flying, &s;un &s;corching, men &s;weat|ting&mdash;Why, there was our la&s;t expedition to Houn&s;low, that day's work carried off Major Molo&s;&s;as. Bunhill-fields never &s;aw a braver commander. He was an irreparable lo&s;s to the &s;ervice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How came that about?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, it was partly the Major's own fault; I advi&s;ed him to pull off his &s;purs before he went upon action; but he was re&s;olute, and would not be rul'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="11">
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Spirit; zeal for the &s;ervice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Doubtle&s;s&mdash;But to proceed: In order to get our men in good &s;pirits, we were quarter'd at Thi&s;tleworth the evening before; at day-break, our regiment form'd at Houn&s;low town's-end, as it might be about here. The Major made a fine di&s;po&s;i|tion: On we marched, the men all in high &s;pirits, to attack the gibbet where Gardel is hanging; but turning down a narrow lane to the left, as it might be about there, in order to po&s;&s;e&s;s a pig's-&s;tye, that we might take the gallows in flank, and, at all events, &s;ecure a retreat; who &s;hould come by but a drove of fat oxen for Smithfield. The drums beat in the front, the dogs bark'd in the rear, the oxen &s;et up a gallop; on they came thundering upon us; broke through our ranks in an in&s;tant, and threw the whole corps in confu&s;i$n.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Terrible!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The Major's hor&s;e took to his heels, away he &s;cour'd over the heath. That gallant commander &s;tuck both his &s;purs into the flank, and for &s;ome time held by his mane; but in cro&s;&s;ing a ditch, the hor&s;e threw up his head, gave the Major a dow&s;e in the chops, and plump'd him into a gravel-pit, ju&s;t by the powder-mills.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Dreadful!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="12">
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Whether from the fall or the fright, the Major mov'd off in a month&mdash; Indeed it was an unfortunate day for us all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>As how?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, as Captain Cucumber, Lieutenant Patty-Pan, En&s;ign Tripe, and my&s;elf, were returning to town in the Turnham-Green &s;tage, we were &s;top'd near the Hammer&s;mith turnpike, and rob'd and &s;tripp'd by a footpad.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>An unfortunate day indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But in &s;ome mea&s;ure to make me amends, I got the Major's commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>O yes. I was the only one of the corps that could ride; otherwi&s;e, we al|ways &s;ucceeded of cour&s;e: No jumping over heads; no underhand work among us; all men of honour; and I mu&s;t do the regi|ment the ju&s;tice to &s;ay, th$re never was a &s;et of more amiable officers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Quiet and peaceable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>As lambs, Sir Jacob, (excepting one boxing-bout at the Three-Compa&s;&s;es in Acton, between Captain Sheers and the Colonel, concerning a game at All-fours) I don't remember a &s;ingle di&s;pute.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, that was mere mutiny; the Captain ought to have been broke.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>He was; for the Colonel not on|ly took away his cockade, but his cu&s;tom;
<PB N="11" REF="13">
and I dont think poor Captain Sheers has done a &s;titch for him &s;ince.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But you &s;oon &s;upplied the lo&s;s of Molo&s;&s;as?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>In part only; no, Sir Jacob, he had great experience; he was train'd up to arms from his youth: At &s;ixteen he trail'd a pike in the Artillery-ground; at eighteen got a company in the Smithfield pioneers; and by the time he was twenty, was made aid-de-camp to Sir Jeffery Grub, Knight, Alderman, and Colonel of the Yellow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A rapid ri&s;e!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, he had a genius for war; but what I wanted in practice, I made up by doubling my diligence. Our porter at home had been a &s;erjeant of marines; &s;o af|ter &s;hop was &s;hut up at night, he us'd to teach me my exerci&s;e; and he had not to deal with a dunce, Sir Jacob.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Your progre&s;s was great.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Amazing. In a week I could &s;houlder, and re&s;t, and poize, and turn to the right, and wheel to the left; and in le&s;s than a month, I could fire without winking or blinking.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A perfect Hannibal!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, and then I learnt to form lines, and hollows, and &s;quares, and evolu|tions, and revolutions; let me tell you, Sir Jacob, it was lucky that Mon&s;ieur kept his
<PB N="12" REF="14">
mirmidons at home, or we &s;hould have pep|per'd his flat-bottom'd boats.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, marry, he had a marvellous e&s;cape.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>We would a taught him what a Br$ton can do who is fighting <HI>pro arvis</HI> and <HI>focus.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Pray now, Major, which do you look upon as the be&s;t di&s;ciplin'd troops, the London regiments, or the Middle&s;ex militia?</P>
