<P>BUT what does it matter, my Lady, whether I drink my tea out of a cup or a &s;aucer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>A great deal, in the polite circles, my Lord. We have been rai&s;ed by a &s;trange freak of fortune, from nothing, as a body may &s;ay; and&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing! As reputable a trade as any in all Go&s;port. You hold a merchant as cheap as if he trotted about with his property in a pack, like a pedlar.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>A merchant, indeed! Curious merchandize you dealt in, truly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>A large a&s;&s;ortment of articles:&mdash;Coals, cloth, herrings, linens, candles, eggs, &s;ugar, treacle, tea, bacon, and b$ick du&s;t; with many more, too tedious to mention in this here adverti&s;ement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, prai&s;e the bridge that carried you over; but, you mu&s;t now drop the trade&s;man, and learn life. Con&s;ider, by the &s;trange&s;t accident, you have been rai&s;ed to&mdash;neither more nor le&s;s than a peer of the realm.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; but I han't been a nobleman more nor a week; and my throat isn't noble enough yet to be proof again&s;t &s;calding. Hand over the milk, my Lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hand over! oh, what's bred in the bone will never come out of the fle&s;h, my lord.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>P&s;haw! there's a fu&s;s indeed! when I was plain Daniel Dowla&s;s, of Go&s;port, I was reckoned as cute a dab in di&s;cour&s;e as any in our town, nobody found fault with me; my thoughts were like a fat plough&punc;man's chub|by children. If folks found them fre&s;h and &s;trong enough, no matter how they were clothed. But people, I take it, fancy a great Lord's thoughts, are like his ricketty brats&mdash;plaguy weak, and damned ordinary; and want a deal of dre&s;&s;ing up to make 'em pa&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why &s;o loud?&mdash;I declare the &s;ervants will hear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hear! and what will they hear but what they know? our &s;tory a &s;ecret, Lord help you!&mdash;tell 'em Queen Anne's dead, my Lady. Don't every body know that old Lord Duberly was &s;uppo&s;ed to die without any heir to his e&s;tate&mdash;as the Doctors &s;ay, of an implication of di&s;orders; and, that his &s;on, Henry Moreland, was lo&s;t &s;ome time ago, in the &s;alt &s;ea.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, there's no occa&s;ion to&mdash;</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't every body know that Lawyer Ferret, of Fernival's Inn, owed the Legatees a grudge&mdash;and pop'd a bit of an adverti&s;ement into the News? "Whereas, if the Heir at Law, if there be any reviving, of the late Ba|ron Duberly, will apply&mdash;&s;o, and &s;o; he'll hear of &s;om'ut greatly to his advantage."</P>

<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Didn't he hunt me out to &s;ecure my title? and lug me from the counter, to clap me into a coach? a hou&s;e here, in Hanover-&s;quare, and an e&s;tate in the country, worth fifteen thou&s;and per annum?&mdash;Why, ble&s;s you, my Lady, every little black devil, with a &s;oot-bag, cries it about the &s;treets, as often as he &s;ays &s;weep.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis a pity but my Lord had left you &s;ome manners, with his money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>He, what my cou&s;in twenty thou&s;and times removed, he mu&s;t have left them by word of mouth.&mdash;Never &s;poke to him but once, in all my born life, upon electioneering matter&mdash;that's a time when mo&s;t of your proud folks make no bones of tippling with a tallow-chan|dler, in his back-room, on a melting day: but he!&mdash;ex|cept calling me cou&s;in, and buying a lot of damaged huck|aback, to cut into kitchen towels, he was as old and &s;tiff as he is now, tho' he has been dead and buried the&s;e nine months, rot him!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>There, again, now!&mdash;Rot him!</P>

<P>Why, an oath, now and then, may &s;lip in to garni&s;h genteel conver&s;ation: but then it &s;hould be done with an air to one's equals, and with a kind of carele&s;s conde&s;cen&s;ion to menials.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, we elegant people find the trade of the tone, as they call it, plaguy fataguing&mdash;What, are you for the <HI>wis-a-was</HI> this morning? much good may do you, my lady,&mdash;damn it, it makes me &s;it &s;tuck up like a bear in a bathing tub.</P>

<P>I have a hundred places to call at&mdash;Folks are &s;o civil &s;ince we came up to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion&mdash;there's dear Lady Littlefigure, Lord Sponge, Mrs. Heldbank, Lady Betty Pillory, the Hon. Mrs. Cheatwell, and&mdash;</P>

<P>Aye, aye; you may always find plenty, in this here town, to be civil to 15,000 a year, my Lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, there's no learning you life. I'm &s;ure they are as kind and friendly&mdash;the &s;upper Lady Betty gave to us and a hundred friends, mu&s;t have co&s;t her fifty good pounds, if it co&s;t a bra&s;s farden; and &s;he does the &s;ame thing, I'm told, three times a week. If &s;he isn't mon&s;trous rich, I wonder, for my part, how &s;he can afford it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, ecod, my lady, that would have puz|zled me too, if they hadn't hooked me into a damn'd game of cocking and punting, I think they call it, where I lo&s;t as much in half-an-hour, as would keep her and her com|pany in frica&s;&s;ee's and whipt &s;ullibub's for a fortnight.

<P>Why, I'm an old batchelor, 'tis true&mdash;and without relations; but the whole country is my family.&mdash;I could not help thinking, as we po&s;ted to town, that every jolly pea&s;ant, and every cherry cheek'd la&s;s, was a kind of humble brother and &s;i&s;ter to me; and they called forth my affections accordingly. Rich or poor, great or &s;mall, we all form one chain Henry: May the larger and le&s;&s;er links hold kindly together, 'till time &s;lides into eternity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>A truce to the&s;e reflections now, my dear Stedfa&s;t.&mdash;They do your heart honour, but mine is filled with a thou&s;and apprehen$ions&mdash;my father!&mdash;my Caroline!&mdash;</P>

<P>Yet humanity, Stedfa&s;t&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfa&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is every man's bu&s;ine&s;s, and the reward he will ultimately receive for it as far above human calcula|tion. But come, thank providence, and not me.&mdash;To furvive at the end of two months, when mo&s;t of the &s;mall parcel of our comrades were dead, or dying about us, with cold and hunger, is no common e&s;cape.</P>

<P>And then in a de&s;perate hope to launch our &s;hat|tered boat in que&s;t of an inhabited country, and to be to&s;&s;ed about for two months more, 'till benumbed and pe|ri&s;hing, we were di&s;covered by the natives and friendly Indians.&mdash;All this, Stedfa&s;t, was indeed a &s;tout trial.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>For what purpo&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfa&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very evident one. The wreck of our &s;hip, has doubtle&s;s, long been public in London. And as the c$ew and pa&s;&s;engers are probably all &s;uppo&s;ed to have pe|ri&s;hed, your abrupt entrance at your father's, might be too much for him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are perfectly right. In the moment when our pa&s;&s;ions are afloat, how beneficial is the cool advice of a friend to direct us. But &s;houldn't I give you a line of introduction to my father?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stedfa&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Umph! why according to u&s;ual form, indeed&mdash;but I was never good at forms; and, in this ca&s;e, it may be better to let me introduce my&s;elf in my own way. I hope Lord Duberly is no &s;tickler for ceremonies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has the manlie&s;t virtue and the warme&s;t heart in the world, my friend, but I confe&s;s to tho&s;e who are unacquainted with them, the&s;e qualities are a little con|cealed by a coldne&s;s in his manner that&mdash;</P>

<P>Oh, I under&s;tand.&mdash;A little &s;tately or &s;o.&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>More.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only a little of the <HI>veille coeur</HI> about him. A long habit too, of haranguing in Parliament, gives a man a kind of dignity of deportment, and an elevation of &s;tyle not to be met with every day you know. But Gentle|man is written legibly upon his brow; erudition &s;hines thro' every poli&s;hed period of his language; and he is the be&s;t of men, and of fathers, believe me.</P>
