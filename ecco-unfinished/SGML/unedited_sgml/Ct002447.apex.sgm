<P>The partial Encomiums, which your Grace be|&s;towed upon my Comedy, when read la&s;t Winter amid&s;t a private Circle of your Friends, led me to hope with &s;ome Degree of Confidence for that Succe&s;s, which from the Indulgence of the Public, I have now experienced:&mdash;Sincerely wi&s;hing both

<BYLINE>Spoken by Mr. BANNISTER, Jun.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>CUSTOM commands a Prologue to each Play;</L>
<L>But cu&s;tom hath not told us what to &s;ay:</L>
<L>No form pre&s;crib'd, 'tis difficult to find,</L>
<L>How to conciliate the Public mind.</L>
<L>The ba&s;hful Bard&mdash;the mode&s;t Mu&s;e's fears,</L>
<L>So long have jingled in your patient Ears,</L>
<L>That now, perhaps, you'll &s;carce vouch&s;afe to &s;tay,</L>
<L>To hear both their Apology&mdash;and Play.</L>
<L>No! Better &s;ure on him at once to call,</L>
<L>With&mdash;Sir, if frighten'd thus, why write at all?</L>
<L>We're not reduc'd yet to a trembling Pen;</L>
<L>Zounds, Bards, will croud us &s;oon, like&mdash;Gentlemen.</L>
<L>Something like this, I heard a Friend once &s;ay,</L>
<L>Who wi&s;h'd (poor &s;oul) to hear a new launch'd Play:</L>
<L>Box'd &s;nug at fir&s;t, completely to his mind,</L>
<L>With only one grave Auditor behind:</L>
<L>E'er the third Act had &s;truggled to its end,</L>
<L>In reel'd three Critics, each the Author's Friend&mdash;</L>
<L>On Prai&s;e determin'd&mdash;Wit confirm'd by Wine;</L>
<L>Each And! and If! was cha&s;te&mdash;correct&mdash;damn'd fine.</L>
<L>To Ta&s;te &s;o mark'd, my Friend, of cour&s;e, gave way;</L>
<L>But &s;queez'd, thump'd, kick'd&mdash;&s;till li&s;ten'd to the Play;</L>
<L>Till by repeated Plaudits grown &s;o Sore,</L>
<L>Nor Fle&s;h nor Blood cou'd bear one Comment more.</L>
<L>Such boi&s;t'rous Friends they &s;urely cannot need,</L>
<L>Who wi&s;h by Merit only to &s;ucceed.</L>
<L>To-night we offer to the Public view,</L>
<L>A Character, you'll own, perhaps, is new,</L>
<L>From Doctor's Commons we the Model draw;</L>
<L>A Promi&s;ing Eleve of Civil Law;</L>
<L><PB REF="7">
And Civil &s;ure that Law which can provide,</L>

<L>Our timid Bard, who dreads the Critic ire,</L>
<L>And thinks my little Tongue can never tire,</L>
<L>Wou'd have me re-a&s;&s;ume the Wig and Gown,</L>
<L>To plead his Goo&s;e-quill Cau&s;e before the Town&punc;</L>
<L>Lord, Sir, &s;ays I, &s;ome better Council bring;</L>
<L>For Females in a Wig are not the Thing.</L>
<L>Your bearded Barri&s;ter, if &s;martly made, is</L>
<L>A &s;urer Advocate among the Ladies.</L>
<L>Madam, he cried, or perriwig'd, or bare&punc;</L>
<L>So you but talk, I never need de&s;pair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Suppo&s;e ye Fair, as I'm &s;o <HI>&s;mooth</HI> a Prater&punc;</L>
<L>I take a Line more con&s;onant to Nature:</L>
<L>Give up the vain Attempt your hearts to warm,</L>
<L>And 'gain&s;t the Men, with Female Weapon Arm.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oft have the Wits, unmindful whom they vex,</L>
<L>Expos'd the Foibles of the &s;ofter Sex.</L>
<L>Laugh'd at their Dre&s;s, their well-&s;hap'd Cork, their&punc; Feathers,</L>
<L>Their &s;teady Bloom, unchanging in all Weathers;</L>
<L>Swore Locks were Grey, that &s;eem'd a comely Brown&punc;</L>

<L>Sweet Image of Mamma, in ev'ry Feature,</L>
<L>The Youth came forth, a mo&s;t delicious creature,</L>
<L>With full dre&s;s'd Skirts, not quite unlike a Hoop,</L>
<L>Hat under Arm, fine Button, and gilt Loop&mdash;</L>
<L>Stiff Stock, long Sword, &s;till dangling in the way,</L>
<L>He &s;ometimes ventur'd to a fir&s;t-night Play:</L>
<L>Tripp'd through the Lobby, mo&s;t completely curl'd;</L>
<L>Nor did a paw-paw Thing for all the World.</L>
<L>Thus he di&s;cours'd, "Sir Dilberry, od's &s;o,</L>

<L>Such was the Smart our Grandmama's would prai&s;e,</L>
<L>Rather unlike the Smart of pre&s;ent days.</L>

<L>One thing in Nature, like a Modern Beau;</L>
<L>Hat &s;louch'd, &s;hort Stick&punc; Knee Trappings, that bring back,</L>

<L>Eternal Boots, and Collar, you'd &s;uppo&s;e,</L>
<L>Cut, in kind contact, with his Buck&s;hip's No&s;e.</L>
<L>Thus trimly deck'd, each night among the Doxies,</L>
<L>He &s;torms the Lobby, and a&s;&s;ails the Boxes;</L>
<L>With Gait and Manner&mdash;&s;omething in this way,</L>
<L>Proves his rare Ta&s;te, and de&s;cants on the Play&mdash;</L>
<L>"Here, Box-keeper! why don't the Ra&s;cal come?</L>

<L>Perfect Indifference to Sen&s;e and Feeling.</L>
<L>To &s;uch our Play not &s;ues;&mdash;but you, ye Fair,</L>
