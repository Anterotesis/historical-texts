<HEAD>PROLOGUE, <HI>By a FRIEND</HI>. Spoken by Mr. HAVARD.</HEAD>
<L>THE piece is <HI>Lillo</HI>'s&mdash;He, long &s;ince in du&s;t:</L>
<L>Criticks far hence; or &s;pare his urn's &s;ad tru&s;t,</L>
<L>Kind to his Mu&s;e, and to his memory ju&s;t;</L>
<L>His Mu&s;e re&s;embles him, and knows no art;</L>
<L>She &s;peaks not to the head, but to the heart.</L>
<L>The artle&s;s maid, by no fal&s;e &s;eal impre&s;s'd,</L>
<L>Bears but an hone&s;t copy of his brea&s;t:</L>
<L>And ev'ry eye has own'd, his natural lay,</L>
<L>Sprung from the heart, wings to the heart it's way.</L>
<L>The Tragic Bard apes not the Epick fire,</L>
<L>On Fancy's wing &s;till aiming to a&s;pire:</L>
<L>In Nature's palace, &s;imple, great, and plain,</L>
<L>Inrich'd and crowded <HI>ornament</HI> were vain:</L>
<L><HI>Embelli&s;hment</HI> does but di&s;tract the mind,</L>
<L>Which <HI>Art</HI> &s;hould never to <HI>minutene&s;s</HI> bind.</L>
<L>Tho' honey'd language &s;he from Hybla &s;teal,</L>
<L>Your <HI>ears</HI> applaud&mdash;your hearts no ardours feel.</L>
<L>With labour'd art tho' the &s;ad tale be told,</L>
<L>The melting tear, mean while congeal'd, grows cold.</L>
<L>When <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion</HI> &s;peaks immediate to the &s;oul,</L>
<L><HI>Parts</HI> &s;he o'erlooks, to gra&s;p at once <HI>the whole</HI>.</L>
<L>To night, your Bard, from your own annals &s;hews,</L>
<L>A dreadful &s;tory of dome&s;tic woes:</L>
<L>From facts he draws (his picture's from the life)</L>
<L>The injur'd hu&s;band, and the faithle&s;s wife,</L>
<L>Doom'd all the train of bo&s;om pangs to prove,</L>
<L>Pangs, which mu&s;t always wait on lawle&s;s love.</L>
<L>Ye generous who feel for other's woe,</L>
<L>Ye fair, who&s;e tears for injur'd virtue flow,</L>
<L>In ju&s;tice to your&s;elves, applaud his plan,</L>
<L>And judge <HI>the poet</HI>, as ye lov'd <HI>the man</HI>.</L>

<L>AN ancient bard, vers'd in dramatick laws,</L>
