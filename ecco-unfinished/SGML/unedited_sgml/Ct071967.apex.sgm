<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_HAVING taken more than ordinary Pains in collecting the Materials which compo&s;e the following Hi&s;tory, we could not be &s;atisfied with our &s;elves, if any Thing were wanting to it, which might render it intirely &s;atisfactory to the Publick: It is for this Rea&s;on we have &s;ubjoined to the Work, a &s;hort Ab&s;tract of the Laws now in Force again&s;t Pyrates, and made choice of &s;ome particular Ca&s;es, (the mo&s;t curious we could meet with) which have been hereto|fore tried, by which it will appear what Actions have, and what have not been adjudged Pyracy.</P>
<P>It is po&s;&s;ible this Book may fall into the Hands of &s;ome Ma&s;ters of Ships, and other hone&s;t Mariners, who frequent|ly, by contrary Winds or Tempe&s;ts, or other Accidents inci|dent to long Voyages, find them&s;elves reduced to great Di|&s;tre&s;&s;es, either through Scarcity of Provi&s;ions, or Want of Stores. I &s;ay, it may be a Direction to &s;uch as tho&s;e, what Lengths they may venture to go, without violating the Law of Nations, in Ca&s;e they &s;hould meet other Ships at Sea, or be ca&s;t on &s;ome inho&s;pitable Shore, which &s;hould refu&s;e to trade with them for &s;uch Things as are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the Pre&s;ervation of their Lives, or the Safety of the Ship and Cargoe.</P>
<P>We have given a few In&s;tances in the Cour&s;e of this Hi&s;tory of the Inducements Men have to engage them&s;elves
<PB REF="3">
headlong in a Life of &s;o much Peril to them&s;elves, and &s;o de&s;tructive to the Navigation of the trading World; to re|medy which Evil there &s;eems to be but two Ways, either to find Employment for the great Numbers of Seamen turn'd adrift at the Conclu&s;ion of a War, and thereby prevent their running into &s;uch &V;ndertakings, or to guard &s;uf|ficiently the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI> the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and other Places whereto Pyrates re&s;ort.</P>
<P>I cannot but take Notice in this Place, that during this long Peace, I have not &s;o much as heard of a <HI>Dutch</HI> Pyrate: It is not that I take them to be hone&s;ter than their Neigh|bours; but when we account for it, it will, perhaps, be a Reproach to our &s;elves for our want of Indu&s;try: The Rea|&s;on I take to be, that after a War, when the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships are laid up, they have a Fi&s;hery, where their Seamen find immediate Bu&s;ine&s;s, and as comfortable Bread as they had before. Had ours the &s;ame Recour&s;e in their Nece&s;&s;ities, I&punc;m certain we &s;hould find the &s;ame Effect from it; for a Fi&s;hery is a Trade that cannot be over&s;tock'd; the Sea is wide enough for us all, we need not quarrel for Elbow-room: Its Stores are infinite, and will ever Reward the Labourer. Be&s;ides, our own Coa&s;t, for the mo&s;t Part, &s;upply the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who emtl$y &s;everal hundred Sail con&s;tantly in the Trade, and &s;o &s;ell to us our own Fi&s;h. I call it our own, for the Sove|reignty of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Seas, are to this Day acknowledged us by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and all the neighbouring Nations; where|fore, if there was a publick Spirit among&s;t us, it would be well worth our while to e&s;tabli&s;h a National Fi&s;hery, which would be the be&s;t Means in the World to prevent Pyracy, employ a Number of the Poor, and ea&s;e the Nation of a great Burthen, by lowering the Price of Provi&s;ion in gene|ral, as well as if &s;everal other Commodities.</P>
<P>I need not being any Proofs of what I advance, <HI>viz.</HI> that there are Maltitudes of Seamen at this Day unemploy'd; it is but t$o evident by their &s;traggling, and begging all over the Kingdom. N$r is it &s;o much their Inclination to Idlene&s;s, as their own hard Fate, in being ca&s;t off after their Work is a $e, to $Word$ or feal. I $ave not known a Man of
<PB REF="4">
War commi&s;&s;ion'd for &s;everal Years pa&s;t, but three times her Compliment of Men have offer'd them&s;elves in twenty four Hours; the Merchants take their Advantage of this, le&s;&s;en their Wages, and tho&s;e few who are in Bu&s;ine&s;s are poorly paid, and but poorly fed; &s;uch &V;&s;age breeds Di&s;con|tents among&s;t them, and makes them eager for any Change.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not repeat what I have &s;aid in the Hi&s;tory con|cerning the Privateers of the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> where I have taken Notice they live upon Spoil; and as Cu&s;tom is a &s;econd Nature, it is no Wonder that, when an hone&s;t Livlyhood is not ea&s;ily had, they run into one &s;o like their own; &s;o that it may be &s;aid, that Privateers in time of War are a Nur|&s;ery for Pyrates again&s;t a Peace.</P>
<P>Now we have accounted for their Ri&s;e and Beginning, it will be natural to enquire why they are not taken and de|&s;troy'd, before they come to any Head, &s;eeing that they are &s;eldom le&s;s than twelve Men of War &s;tation'd in our <HI>Ame|rican</HI> Plantations, even in Time of Peace; a Force &s;uffi|cient to contend with a powerful Enemy. This Enquiry, perhaps, will not turn much to the Honour of tho&s;e concern'd in that Service; however, I hope I may be excus'd, if what I hint is with a De&s;ign of &s;erving the Publick.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, 'tis &s;trange that a few Pyrates &s;hould ravage the Seas for Years, without ever being light upon, by any of our Ships of War; when in the mean Time, they (the Py|rates) &s;hall take Fleets of Ships; it looks as if one was much more dilligent in their Affairs, than the other. <HI>Roberts</HI> and his Crew, alone, took <HI>400</HI> Sail, before he was de&s;troy'd.</P>
<P>This Matter, I may probably &s;et right another Time, and only ob&s;erve for the pre&s;ent, that the Pyrates at Sea, have the &s;ame Sagacity with Robbers at Land; as the latter under&s;tand what Roads are mo&s;t frequented, and where it is mo&s;t likely to meet with Booty, &s;o the former know what Latitude to lie in, in order to intercept Ships; and as the Pyrates happen to be in want of Provi&s;ions, Stores, or any particular Lading, they crui&s;e accordingly for &s;uch Ships, and are moraly certain of meeting with them; and by the &s;ame Rea&s;on, if the Man of War crui&s;e in tho&s;e Latitudes,
<PB REF="5">
they are as &s;ure of finding the Pyrates, as the Pyrates are to find the Merchant Ships; and if the Pyrates are not to be met with by the Men of War in &s;uch a Latitude, then &s;urely down the &s;ame Latitude may the Merchant Ships arrive &s;afely to their Port.</P>
<P>To make this a little plainer to my Country Readers, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve that all our outward bound Ships, &s;ometime after they leave the Land, &s;teer into the Latitude of the Place they are bound to; if to the <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> I&s;lands, or any Part of the Main of <HI>America,</HI> as <HI>New-York, New-England, Virginia, &amp;c.</HI> becau&s;e the Latitude is the only Certainty in tho&s;e Voyages to be found, and then they &s;ail due We&s;t, till they come to their Port, without altering their Cour&s;e. In this We&s;t Way lie the Pyrates, whether it be to <HI>Virginia, &amp;c.</HI> or <HI>Nevis,</HI> St. <HI>Chri&s;to|phers, Mont&s;erat, Jamaica, &amp;c.</HI> &s;o that if the Mer|chant Ships bound thither, do not fall a Prey to them one Day, they mu&s;t another: Therefore I &s;ay, if the Men of War take the &s;ame Track, the Pyrates mu&s;t unavoidably fall into their Mouths, or be frighted away, for where the Game is, their will the Vermine be; if the latter &s;hould be the Ca&s;e, the trading Ships, as I &s;aid before, will pa&s;s unmole&s;ted and &s;afe, and the Pyrates be reduced to take Refuge in &s;ome of their lurking Holes about the uninhabited I&s;lands, where their Fate would be like that of the Fox in his Den, if they &s;hould venture out, they would be hunted and taken, and if they &s;tay within they mu&s;t &s;tarve.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t ob&s;erve another Thing, that the Pyrates general|ly &s;hift their Rovings, according to the Sea&s;on of the Year; in the Summer they crui&s;e mo&s;tly along the Coa&s;t of the Con|tinent of <HI>America,</HI> but the Winters there, being a little too cold for them, they follow the Sun, and go towards the I&s;lands, at the approach of cold Weather. Every Man who has u&s;ed the <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Trade, knows this to be true; therefore, &s;ince we are &s;o well acquainted with all their M$t$ens, I cannot &s;ee why our Men of War under a proper Regulation, may not go to the Southward, in&s;tead of lying up all the Winter u&s;ele&s;s: But I &s;hall proceed too far
<PB REF="6">
in this Enquiry, I &s;hall therefore quit it, and &s;ay &s;ome thing of the following Sheets, which the Author may venture to a&s;&s;ure the Reader that they have one Thing to recommend them, which is Truth; tho&s;e Facts which he him&s;elf was not an Eye-Witne&s;s of, he had from the authentick Relati|ons of the Per&s;ons concerned in taking the Pyrates, as well as from the Mouths of the Pyrates them&s;elves, after they were taken, and he conceives no Man can produce better Te&s;timonies to &s;upport the Credit of any Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>It will be ob&s;erved, that the Account of the Actions of <HI>Roberts</HI> runs into a greater Length, than that of any other Pyrate, for which we can a&s;&s;ign two Rea&s;ons, fir&s;t, becau&s;e he ravaged the Seas longer than the re&s;t, and of Con&s;equence there mu&s;t be a greater Scene of Bu&s;ine&s;s in his Life: Second|ly, being re&s;olved not to weary the Reader, with tire&s;ome Repetitions: When we found the Circum&s;tances in <HI>Roberts</HI>'s Life, and other Pyrates, either as to pyratical Articles, or any Thing el&s;e, to be the &s;ame, we thought it be&s;t to give them but once, and cho&s;e <HI>Robert</HI>'s Life for that Purpo&s;e, he ha|ving made more Noi&s;e in the World, than &s;ome others.</P>
<P>As to the Lives of our two female Pyrates, we mu&s;t con|fe&s;s they may appear a little Extravagant, yet they are never the le&s;s true for &s;eeming &s;o, but as they were pub|lickly tried for their Pyracies, there are living Witne&s;&s;es enough to ju&s;tify what we have laid down concerning them; It is certain, we have produced &s;ome Particulars which were not &s;o publickly known, the Rea&s;on is, we were more inqui&s;i|tive into the Circum&s;tances of their past Lives, than other People, who had no other De&s;ign, than that of gratifying their own private Curio&s;ity: If there are &s;ome Incidents and Turns in their Stories, which may give them a little the Air of a <HI>Novel,</HI> they are not invented or contrived for that Purpo&s;e, it is a Kind of Reading this Author is but little acquainted with, but as he him&s;elf was exceedingly diverted with them, when they were related to him, he thought they might have the &s;ame Effect upon the Reader.</P>
<P>I pre&s;ume we need make no Apology for giving the Name of a Hi&s;tory to the following Sheets, though they contain no|thing
<PB REF="7">
but the Actions of a Parcel of Robbers. It is Bra|very and Stratagem in War which make Actions worthy of Record; in which Sen&s;e the Adventures here related will be thought de&s;erving that Name. <HI>Plutarch</HI> is very cir|cum&s;tantial in relating the Actions of <HI>Spartacus,</HI> the Slave, and makes the Conque&s;t of him, one of the greate&s;t Glories of <HI>Marcus Cra&s;&s;us;</HI> and it is probable, if this Slave had liv'd a little longer, <HI>Plutarch</HI> would have given us his Life at large. <HI>Rome,</HI> the Mi&s;tre&s;s of the World, was no more at fir&s;t than a Refuge for Thieves and Outlaws; and if the Progre&s;s of our Pyrates had been equal to their Be|ginning; had they all united, and &s;ettled in &s;ome of tho&s;e I&s;lands, they might, by this Time, have been honoured with the Name of a Commonwealth, and no Power in tho&s;e Parts of the World could have been able to di&s;pute it with them.</P>
<P>If we have &s;eem'd to glance, with &s;ome Freedom, at the Behaviour of &s;ome Governors of Provinces abroad, it has been with Caution; and, perhaps, we have not declar'd as much as we knew: However, we hope tho&s;e Gentlemen in the &s;ame Station, who have never given Occa&s;ion for the like Cen&s;ure, will take no Offence, tho' the Word Governor is &s;ometimes made u&s;e of.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE PYRATES.</HEAD>
<P>_AS the Pyrates in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> have been &s;o formidable and numerous, that they have interrupted the Trade of <HI>Europe</HI> into tho&s;e Parts; and our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants, in parti|cular, have &s;uffered more by their Depredations, than by the united Force of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> in the late War: We do not doubt but the World will be curious to know the Original and Progre&s;s of the&s;e De&s;peradoes, who were the Terror of the trading Part of the World.</P>
<P>But, before we enter upon their particular Hi|&s;tory, it will not be ami&s;s, by way of Introduction, to &s;hew, by &s;ome Examples drawn from Hi&s;tory, the great Mi&s;chief and Danger which threatens Kingdoms and Commonwealths, from the Increa&s;e
<PB N="18" REF="23">
of the&s;e &s;ort of Robbers; when either by the Trou|bles of particular Times, or the Neglect of Go|vernments, they are not cru&s;h'd before they gather Strength.</P>
<P>It has been the Ca&s;e heretofore, that when a &s;in|gle Pyrate has been &s;uffered to range the Seas, as not being worth the Notice of a Government, he has by Degrees grown &s;o powerful, as to put them to the Expence of a great deal of Blood and Trea&s;ure, before he was &s;uppre&s;s'd; we &s;hall not exa|mine how it came to pa&s;s, that our Pyrates in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> have continually increa&s;ed till of late; this is an Enquiry which belongs to the Legi&s;lature, or Repre&s;entatives of the People in Parliament, and to them we &s;hall leave it.</P>
<P>Our Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hall be briefly to &s;hew, what from Beginnings, as incon&s;iderable as the&s;e, other Nations have &s;uffered.</P>
<P>In the Times of <HI>Marius</HI> and <HI>Sylla, Rome</HI> was in her greate&s;t Strength, yet &s;he was &s;o torn to Pieces by the Factions of tho&s;e two great Men, that every Thing which concerned the publick Good was altogether neglected, when certain Pyrates broke out from <HI>Cicilia,</HI> a Country of <HI>A&s;ia Minor,</HI> &s;ituate on the Coa&s;t of the <HI>Mediteranean,</HI> betwixt <HI>Syria</HI> on the Ea&s;t, from whence it is divided by Mount <HI>Tau|ris,</HI> and <HI>Armenia Minor</HI> on the We&s;t. This Begin|ning was mean and incon&s;iderable, having but two or three Ships, and a few Men, with which they crui&s;ed about the <HI>Greek</HI> I&s;lands, taking &s;uch Ships as were very ill arm'd or weakly defended; however, by the taking of many Prizes, they &s;oon increa&s;ed in Wealth and Power: The fir&s;t Action of their's which made a Noi&s;e, was the taking of <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> who was as yet a Youth, and who being obliged to fly from the Cruelties of <HI>Sylla,</HI> who &s;ought his Life, went into <HI>Bithinia,</HI> and &s;o journed a while with <HI>Ni|comedes,</HI> King of that Country; in his Return back
<PB N="19" REF="24">
by Sea, he was met with, and taken, by &s;ome of the&s;e Pyrates, near the I&s;land of <HI>Pharmacu&s;a:</HI> The&s;e Pyrates had a barbarous Cu&s;tom of tying their Pri|&s;oners back to back and throwing them into the Sea; but, &s;uppo&s;ing <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> to be &s;ome Per&s;on of a high Rank, becau&s;e of his purple Robes, and the Num|ber of his Attendants, they thought it would be more for their Profit to pre&s;erve him, in hopes of receiving a great Sum for his Ran&s;om; therefore they told him he &s;hould have his Liberty, provided he would pay them twenty Talents, which they judg'd to be a very high Demand, in our Money, about three thou&s;and &s;ix hundred Pounds Sterling; he &s;miled, and of his own Accord promi&s;ed them fifty Talents; they were both plea&s;ed, and &s;urprized at his An&s;wer, and con&s;ented that &s;everal of his Attendants &s;hould go by his Direction and rai&s;e the Money; and he was left among the&s;e Ruffians with no more than three Attendants. He pa&s;s'd eight and thirty Days, and &s;eem'd &s;o little concern'd or afraid, that often when he went to &s;leep, he u&s;ed to charge them not to make a Noi&s;e, threatning, if they di&s;turbed him, to hang them all; he al&s;o play'd at Dice with them, and &s;ometimes wrote Ver&s;es and Dialogues, which he u&s;ed to repeat, and al&s;o cau&s;e them to repeat, and if they did not prai&s;e and admire them, he would call them Bea&s;ts and Barbarians, telling them he would crucifie them. They took all the&s;e as the Sallies of a juvenile Hu|mour, and were rather diverted, than di&s;plea&s;ed at them.</P>
<P>At length his Attendants return'd with his Ran|&s;om, which he paid, and was di&s;charg'd; he &s;ail'd for the Port of <HI>Miletum,</HI> where, as &s;oon as he was arriv'd, he u&s;ed all his Art and Indu&s;try in fitting out a Squadron of Ships, which he equipp'd and arm'd at his own Charges; and &s;ailing in Que&s;t of the Pyrates, he &s;urpriz'd them as they lay at An|chor
<PB N="20" REF="25">
among the I&s;lands, and took tho&s;e who had taken him before, with &s;ome others; the Money he found upon them he made Prize of, to reimbur&s;e his Charges, and he carried the Men to <HI>Pergamus</HI> or <HI>Troy,</HI> and there &s;ecured them in Pri&s;on: In the mean Time, he applied him&s;elf to <HI>Junius,</HI> then Governor of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> to whom it belong'd to judge and deter|mine of the Puni&s;hment of the&s;e Men; but <HI>Junius</HI> finding there was no Money to be had, an&s;wered <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> that he would think, at his lei&s;ure, what was to be done with tho&s;e Pri&s;oners; <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> took his leave of him, returned back to <HI>Pergamus,</HI> and com|manded that the Pri&s;oners &s;hould be brought out and executed, according to Law in that Ca&s;e provi|ded; which is taken Notice of, in a Chapter at the End of this Book, concerning the Laws in Ca&s;es of Pyracy: And thus he gave them that Puni&s;hment in Earne&s;t, which he had often threatned them with in Je&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> went &s;trait to <HI>Rome,</HI> where, being ingaged in the De&s;igns of his own private Ambition, as were almo&s;t all the leading Men in <HI>Rome,</HI> the Py|rates who were left, had Time to increa&s;e to a pro|digious Strength; for while the civil Wars la&s;ted, the Seas were left unguarded, &s;o that <HI>Plutarch</HI> tells us, that they erected diver&s;e Ar&s;enals full of all manner of warlike Stores, made commodious Har|bours, &s;et up Watch-Towers and Beacons all along the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Celicia;</HI> that they had a mighty Fleet, well equiped and furni&s;hed, with Galliots of Oars, man'd, not only with Men of de&s;perate Courage, but al&s;o with expert Pilots and Mariners; they had their Ships of Force, and light Pinnaces for crui&s;ing and making Di&s;coveries, in all no le&s;s than a thou&s;and Sail; &s;o gloriou&s;ly &s;et out, that they were as much to be envied for their gallant Shew, as fear'd for their Force; having the Stern and Quarters all guilded with Gold, and their Oars plated
<PB N="21" REF="26">
with Silver, as well as purple Sails; as if their greate&s;t Delight had been to glory in their Iniquity. Nor were they content with committing Pyracies and In&s;olences by Sea, they committed as great Depredations by Land; or rather made Conque&s;ts, for they took and &s;ack'd no le&s;s than four hundred Cities, laid &s;everal others under Contributions, plundered the Temples of the Gods, and inriched them&s;elves with the offerings depo&s;ited in them; they often landed Bodies of Men, who not only plundered the Villages along the Sea Coa&s;t, but ran&s;ack'd the fine Hou&s;es of the Noblemen along the <HI>Tiber.</HI> A Body of them once took <HI>Sextillius</HI> and <HI>Bellinus</HI> two <HI>Roman</HI> Praetors, in their purple Robes, going from <HI>Rome</HI> to their Governments, and carried them away with all their Sergeants, Officers, and Vergers; they al&s;o took the Daughter of <HI>Antonius</HI> a con&s;ular Per&s;on, and one who had obtain'd the Honour of a Triumph, as &s;he was going to the Country Hou&s;e of her Father.</P>
<P>But what was mo&s;t barbarous, was a Cu&s;tom they had when they took any Ship, of enquiring of the Per&s;ons on Board, concerning their Names and Country; if any of them &s;aid he was a <HI>Roman,</HI> they fell down upon their Knees, as if in a Fright at the Greatne&s;s of that Name, and begged Pardon for what they had done; and imploring his Mercy, they u&s;ed to perform the Offices of Servants about his Per&s;on, and when they found they had deceived him into a Belief of their being &s;incere, they hung out the Ladder of the Ship, and coming with a &s;hew of Curte&s;y, told him he had his Liberty, de&s;iring him to walk out of the Ship; and this in the Middle of the Sea; and when they ob&s;erved him in Sur|prize, as was natural, they u&s;ed to throw him over|board with mighty &s;houts of Laughter; &s;o wanton they were in their Cruelty.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="27">
Thus, while <HI>Rome</HI> was Mi&s;tre&s;s of the World, &s;he &s;uffered In&s;ults and Affronts, almo&s;t at her Gates, from the&s;e Powerful Robbers; but what for a while made Faction cea&s;e, and row&s;ed the Genius of that People, never u&s;ed to &s;uffer Wrongs from a fair Enemy, was an exce&s;&s;ive Scarcity of Provi&s;ions in <HI>Rome,</HI> occa&s;ioned by all the Ships loaden with Corn and Provi&s;ions from <HI>Siclly, C$r&s;ica,</HI> and other Places, being intercepted and taken by the&s;e Pyrates, in&s;o|much that they were almo&s;t reduced to a Famine: Upon this, <HI>Pompey</HI> the <HI>Great</HI> was immediately ap|pointed General to manage this War; five hundred Ships were immediately fitted out, he had fourteen Senators, Men of Experience in the War, for his Vice-Admirals; and &s;o con&s;iderable an Enemy, were the&s;e Ruffians become, that no le&s;s than an Army of a hundred thou&s;and Foot, and five thou|&s;and Hor&s;e was appointed to invade them by Land; but it happened very luckily for <HI>Rome,</HI> that <HI>Pompey</HI> &s;ail'd out before the Pyrates had Intelligence of a De&s;ign again&s;t them, &s;o that their Ships were &s;cat|tered all over the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> like Bees gone out from a Hive, &s;ome one Way, &s;ome another, to bring Home their lading; <HI>Pompey</HI> divided his Fleet into thirteen Squadrons, to whom he appointed their &s;everal Stations, &s;o that great Numbers of the Pyrates ell into their Hands, Ship by Ship, with|out any Lo&s;s; forty Days he pa&s;s'd in &s;couring the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> &s;ome of the Fleet cruizing along the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africk,</HI> &s;ome about the I&s;lands, and &s;ome upon the <HI>Italian</HI> Coa&s;ts, &s;o that often tho&s;e $Word$ who were flying from one Squadron, fell in with another; however, &s;ome of them e&s;caped, and the&s;e making directly to <HI>Cilicia,</HI> and acquaint|ing their Confederates on Shore with what had happened, they appointed a Reudezvous of all the Ships that had e&s;caped at the <HI>Port of Corace&s;ium</HI> in the &s;ame Country. <HI>Pompey</HI> finding the <HI>Mediterranean</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="28">
quite clear, appointed a meeting of all his Fleet at the Haven of <HI>Brundu&s;ium,</HI> and from thence &s;ailing round into the <HI>Adriatick,</HI> he went directly to attack the&s;e Pyrates in their Hives; as &s;oon as he came near <HI>Corece&s;ium</HI> in <HI>Cilicia,</HI> where the Remainder of the Pyrates now lay, they had the Hardine&s;s to come and give him Battle, but the Genius of old <HI>Rome</HI> prevailed, and the Pyrates received an entire Overthrow, being all either taken or de&s;troy'd; but as they made many &s;trong Fortre&s;&s;es upon the Sea Coa&s;t, and built Ca&s;tles, and &s;trong Holds up the Country, about the Foot of Mount <HI>Taurus,</HI> he was obliged to be&s;iege them with his Army; &s;ome Pla|ces he took by Storm, others &s;urrendered to his Mercy, to whom he gave their Lives, and at length he made an entire Conque&s;t.</P>
<P>But it is probable, that had the&s;e Pyrates receiv'd &s;ufficient Notice of the <HI>Roman</HI> Preparation again&s;t them, &s;o as they might have had Time to draw their &s;cattered Strength into a Body, to have met <HI>Pompey</HI> by Sea, the Advantage appear'd greatly on their Side, in Numbers of Shipping, and of Men; nor did they want Courage, as may be &s;een by their coming out of the Port of <HI>Corace&s;ium,</HI> to give the <HI>Romans</HI> Battle, with a Force much inferior to their's; I &s;ay, had they overthrown <HI>Pompey,</HI> it is likely they would have made greater Attempts, and <HI>Rome,</HI> which had conquer'd the whole World might have been &s;ubdued by a parcel of Pyrates.</P>
<P>This is a Proof, how dangerous it is to Govern|ments to be negligent, and not take an early Care in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the&s;e Sea Banditti, before they gather Strength.</P>
<P>The Truth of this Maxim may be better exem|plefied in the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Barbarou&s;e,</HI> a Native of the Citty of <HI>Mitylene,</HI> in the I&s;land of <HI>Lesbos,</HI> in the <HI>Fgean</HI> Sea; a Fellow of ordinary Birth, who being bred to the Sea, fir&s;t &s;et out from thence upon

the pyrating Account with only one &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el, but by the Prizes he took, he gain'd immen&s;e Rich|es, &s;o that getting a great Number of large Ships, all the b$ld and di&s;&s;olute Fellows of tho&s;e I&s;lands, fl$$k'd to him, and li&s;ted in his Service, for the Hopes of Booty; &s;o that his Strength was increa|&s;$$ $o a formidable Fleet: With the&s;e he perform'd $Word$ bold and adventurous Actions, that he became the Terror of the Seas.

<P>NONE of the&s;e bold Adventurers were ever &s;o much talked of, for a while, as <HI>Avery;</HI> he made as great a Noi&s;e in the World as <HI>Meriveis</HI> does now, and was looked upon to be a Per&s;on of as great Con&s;equence; he was re|pre&s;ented in <HI>Europe,</HI> as one that had rai&s;ed him&s;elf to the Dignity of a King, and was likely to be the Founder of a new Monarchy; having, as it was &s;aid, taken immen&s;e Riches, and married the <HI>Great Mo|guls</HI> Daughter, who was taken in an <HI>Indian</HI> Ship, which fell into his Hands; and that he had by her many Children, living in great Royalty and State; that he had built Forts, erected Magazines, and was Ma&s;ter of a &s;tout Squadron of Ships, man'd with able and de&s;perate Fellows of all Nations; that he gave Commi&s;&s;ions out in his own Name, to the Captains of his Ships, and to the Commanders of his Forts, and was acknowledg'd by them, as their Prince. A Play was writ upon him, call'd, the <HI>Suc|ce&s;sful Pyrate;</HI> and, the&s;e Accounts obtain'd &s;uch Belief, that &s;everal Schemes were offer'd to the Council, for fitting out a Squadron to take him; while others were for offering him, and his Compa|nions, an Act of Grace, and inviting them to <HI>Eng|land,</HI> with all their Trea&s;ure, lea&s;t his growing

Greatne&s;s might hinder the Trade of <HI>Europe,</HI> to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI></P>
<P>Yet, all the&s;e were no more than fal&s;e Rumours, improved by the Credulity of &s;ome, and the Hu|mour of others who love to tell &s;trange Things; for, while it was &s;aid, he was a&s;piring at a Crown, he wanted a Shilling; and at the &s;ame Time it was given out he was in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch prodigious Wealth in <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> he was &s;tarving in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>No doubt, but the Reader will have a Curio&s;ity of knowing what became of this Man, and what, were the true Grounds of &s;o many fal&s;e Reports, concerning him; therefore, I &s;hall in as brief a Man|ner, as I can, give his Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>He was born in the We&s;t of <HI>England,</HI> near <HI>Ply|mouth,</HI> in <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> being bred to the Sea, he &s;erved as a Mate of a Merchant-Man, in &s;everal trading Voyages: It happen'd before the Peace of <HI>Ry&s;wick,</HI> when there was an Alliance, betwixt <HI>Spain, England, Holland, &amp;c.</HI> again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> that the <HI>French</HI> in <HI>Martinico,</HI> carried on a &s;mugling Trade, with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> on the Continent of <HI>Peru,</HI> which, by the Laws of <HI>Spain,</HI> is not allowed to Friends in Time of Peace, for none but native <HI>Spaniards</HI> are permit|ted to Traffick in tho&s;e Parts, or &s;et their Feet on &s;hore, unle&s;s they are brought as Pri&s;oners of War; wherefore they con&s;tantly keep certain Ships crui&s;|ing along the Coa&s;t, whom they call <HI>Guarda del Co&s;ta,</HI> who have the Orders to make Prizes of all Ships they can light of within five Leagues of Shore. Now the <HI>French</HI> growing very bold in Trade, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> being poorly provided with Ships, and tho&s;e they had being of no Force, it often fell out that when they light of the <HI>French</HI> Smuglers, they were not &s;trong enough to attack them, there|fore is was re&s;olved in <HI>Spain,</HI> to hire two or three &s;tout foreign Ships for their Service, which being known at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> &s;ome Merchants of that City,
<PB N="27" REF="32">
fitted out two Ships of thirty odd Guns, and 120 Hands each, well furni&s;hed with Provi&s;ion and Am|munition, and all other Stores; and the Hire being agreed for, by &s;ome Agents for <HI>Spain,</HI> they were commanded to &s;ail for <HI>Corruna</HI> or the <HI>Groine,</HI> there to receive their Orders, and to take on board &s;ome <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Gentlemen, who were to go Pa&s;&s;engers to <HI>New-Spain.</HI></P>
<P>Of one of the&s;e Ships, which I take her to be called the <HI>Duke, Avery</HI> was fir&s;t Mate, and being a Fellow of more Cunning than Courage, he in&s;inua|ted him&s;elf into the good Will of &s;everal of the bolde&s;t Fellows on board the other Ship, as well as that which he was on board of; having &s;ound|ed their Inclinations before he opened him&s;elf, and finding them ripe for his De&s;ign, he at length propo&s;ed to them, to run away with the Ship, telling them what great Wealth was to be had up|on the Coa&s;ts of <HI>India:</HI> It was no &s;ooner &s;aid than agreed to, and they agreed to execute their Plot at ten a Clock the Night following.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be ob&s;erv'd, the Captain was one of tho&s;e who are mightily addicted to Punch, &s;o that he pa&s;&s;ed mo&s;t of his Time a &s;hore, in &s;ome little drinking Ordinary; but this Day, he did not go on &s;hore as u&s;ual; however, this did not &s;poil the De|&s;ign, for he took his u&s;ual Do&s;e on board, and &s;o got to Bed before the Hour appointed for the Bu&s;i|ne&s;s: The Men al&s;o who were not privy to the De|&s;ign, turned into their Hammocks, leaving none upon Deck but the Con&s;pirators, who indeed were the greate&s;t Part of the Ships Crew. At the Time agreed on, the <HI>Dutche&s;s</HI>'s Long-Boat appear'd, which <HI>Avery</HI> hailing in the u&s;ual Manner, was an&s;wered by the Men in her, <HI>Is your drunken Boat&s;wain on board?</HI> Which was the Watch Word agreed between them, and <HI>Avery</HI> replying in the Affirmative, the Boat
<PB N="28" REF="33">
came aboard with &s;ixteen &s;tout Fellows, and joined the Company.</P>
<P>When our Gentry &s;aw that all was clear, they &s;ecured the Hatches, &s;o went to Work; they did not &s;lip the Anchor, but weigh'd it lei&s;urely, and &s;o put to Sea without any Di&s;order or Confu&s;ion, tho' there were &s;everal Ships then lying in the Bay, and among them a <HI>Dutch</HI> Frigate of forty Guns, the Captain of which was offered a great Reward to go out after her; but <HI>Minheer,</HI> who perhaps would not have been willing to have been &s;erved &s;o him&s;elf, could not be prevail'd upon to give &s;uch U&s;age to another, and &s;o let Mr. <HI>Avery</HI> pur&s;ue his Voyage, whether he had a Mind to.</P>
<P>The Captain, who by this Time was waked, either by the Motion of the Ship, or the Noi&s;e of work|ing the Tackles, rung the Bell; <HI>Avery</HI> and two others went into the Cabin; the Captain, half a &s;leep, and in a kind of Fright, ask'd, <HI>What was the Matter? Avery</HI> an&s;wered cooly, <HI>Nothing;</HI> the Captain replied, <HI>&s;omething's the Matter with the Ship, Does &s;he drive? What Weather is it?</HI> Thinking nothing le&s;s than that it had been a Storm, and that the Ship was driven from her Anchors: <HI>No no</HI> an&s;wered <HI>Avery, we're at Sea, with a fair Wind and good Weather. At Sea!</HI> &s;ays the Captain, <HI>How can that be? Come,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Avery, don't be in a Fright, but put on your Cloaths, and I'll let you into a Secret:&mdash;</HI><HI>You mu&s;t know, that I am Captain of this Ship now, and this is my Cabin, therefore you mu&s;t walk out; I am bound to</HI> Madaga&s;car, <HI>with a De&s;ign of making my own Fortune, and that of all the brave Fellows joined with me.</HI></P>
<P>The Captain having a little recover'd his Sen&s;es, began to apprehend the meaning; however, his Fr$ght was as great as before, which <HI>Avery</HI> per|ceiving, bad him fear nothing, for, &s;ays he, if you
<PB N="29" REF="34">
have a Mind to make one of us, we'll receive you, and if you'll turn Sober, and mind your Bu&s;ine&s;s, perhaps in Time I may make you one of my Lieu|tenants, if not, here's a Boat a Long-&s;ide, and you &s;hall be &s;et on Shore.</P>
<P>The Captain was glad to hear this, and therefore accepted of his Offer, and the whole Crew being called up, to know who was willing to go on Shore with the Captain, and who to &s;eek their Fortunes with the re&s;t; there were not above five or &s;ix who were willing to quit this Enterprize; wherefore they were put into the Boat with the Captain that Minute, and made their Way to the Shore, as well as they could.</P>
<P>They proceeded on their Voyage to <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> but I do not find they took any Ships in their Way; when they arriv'd at the N. E. Part of that I&s;land, they found two Sloops at Anchor, who upon &s;eeing them, &s;lipt their Cables and run them&s;elves a &s;hore, the Men all landing, and running into the Woods; the&s;e were two Sloops which the Men had run away with from the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and &s;eeing <HI>Avery,</HI> they &s;uppo&s;ed him to be &s;ome Frigate &s;ent to take them, and therefore not being of Force to engage him, they did what they could to &s;ave them&s;elves.</P>
<P>He gue&s;s'd what they were, and &s;ent &s;ome of his Men on &s;hore to let them know they were Friends, and to offer they might join together for their com|mon Safety; the Sloop's Men were well arm'd and had po&s;ted them&s;elves in a Wood, with Sentinels ju&s;t on the out &s;ide, to ob&s;erve whether the Ship landed her Men to per&s;ue them, and, they ob&s;erv|ing only two or three Men to come towards them without Arms, did not oppo&s;e them, but having challeng'd them, and they an&s;wering they were Friends, they lead them to their Body, where they delivered their Me&s;&s;age; at fir&s;t, they apprehend|ed it was a Stratagem to decoy them on Board,
<PB N="30" REF="35">
but when the Amba&s;&s;adors offered that the Captain him&s;elf, and as many of the Crew as they &s;hould name, would meet them on &s;hore without Arms, they believed them to be in Earne&s;t, and they &s;oon entered into a Confidence with one another; tho&s;e on Board coming on Shore, and &s;ome of tho&s;e on Shore going on Board.</P>
<P>The Sloops Men were rejoiced at the new Ally, for their Ve&s;&s;els were &s;o &s;mall, that they could not attack a Ship of any Force, &s;o that hitherto they had not taken any con&s;iderable Prize, but now they hop'd to fly at high Game; and <HI>Avery</HI> was as well plea&s;ed at this Reinforcement, to &s;trengthen them for any brave Enterprize, and tho' the Booty mu&s;t be le&s;&s;en'd to each, by being divided into &s;o many Shares, yet he found out an Expedient not to &s;uffer by it him&s;elf, as &s;hall be &s;hewn in it's Place.</P>
<P>Having con&s;ulted what was to be done, they re|&s;olved to &s;ail out together upon a Cruize, the Gal|ley and two Sloops; they therefore fell to work to get the Sloops off, which they &s;oon effected, and &s;teering towards the <HI>Arabian</HI> Coa&s;t, near the River <HI>Indus,</HI> the Man at the Ma&s;t-Head &s;pied a Sail, upon which they gave Chace, and as they came nearer to her, they perceiv'd her to be a tall Ship, and fancied &s;he might be a <HI>Dutch Ea&s;t-India</HI> Man, homeward bound; but &s;he proved a better Prize; when they fired at her to bring too, &s;he hoi&s;ted <HI>Moguls</HI> Colours, and &s;eemed to &s;tand upon her defence, <HI>Avery</HI> only canonaded at a Di&s;tance, and &s;ome of his Men began to &s;u&s;pect that he was not the Hero they took him for: However, the Sloops made U&s;e of their Time, and coming one on the Bow, and the other on the Quarter of the Ship, clapt her on Board, and enter'd her; upon which &s;he immediately &s;truck her Colours and yielded; &s;he was one of the <HI>Great Mogul</HI>'s own Ships, and there were in her &s;everal of the greate&s;t Per&s;ons of his Court; among whom

it was &s;aid, one of his Daughters, who were going on a Pligrimage to <HI>Mecca;</HI> the <HI>Mahometans</HI> think|ing them&s;elves obliged once in their Lives to vi&s;it that Place; and they were carrying with them rich Offerings to Pre&s;ent at the Shrine of <HI>Mahomet.</HI> It is known, that the Ea&s;tern People travel with the utmo&s;t Magnificence, &s;o that they had with them all their Slaves and Attendants, their rich Habits and Jewels, with Ve&s;&s;els of Gold and Silver, and great Sums of Money, to defray the Charges of their Journey by Land; wherefore the Plunder got by this Prize, is not ea&s;ily computed.</P>
<P>Having taken all the Trea&s;ure on board their own Ships, and plunder'd their Prize of every Thing el&s;e, they either wanted or liked, they let her go; &s;he not being able to continue her Voyage returned back: As &s;oon as the News came to the <HI>Mogul,</HI> and he knew that they were <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> who had robbed them, he threatened loud, and talk'd of &s;ending a mighty Army, with Fire and Sword, to extirpate the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> from all their Settlements on the <HI>Indian</HI> Coa&s;t. The <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company in <HI>England,</HI> were very much alarm'd at it, however, by Degrees they found Means to pacify him, by promi&s;ing to do their Endeavours to take the Rob|bers, and deliver them into his Hands; however, the great Noi&s;e this Thing made in <HI>Europe,</HI> as well as <HI>India,</HI> was the Occa&s;ion of all tho&s;e Roman|tick Stories which were form'd of <HI>Avery</HI>'s Greatne&s;s.</P>
<P>In the mean Time our &s;uccesful Plunderers agreed to make the be&s;t of their Way back to <HI>Ma|daga&s;car,</HI> intending to make that Place their Maga|zine, or Repo&s;itory for all their Trea&s;ure, and to build a &s;mall Fortification there, and leave a few Hands always on Shore to look after it, and de|fend it from any Attempts of the Natives; but <HI>Avery</HI> put an end to this Project, and made it alto|gether unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>

As they were Steering their Cour&s;e, as has been &s;aid, he &s;ends a Boat on board of each of the Sloops, de&s;iring the Chief of them to come on Board of him, in Order to hold a Council; they did &s;o, and he told them he had &s;omething to propo&s;e to them for the common Good, which was to provide again&s;t Accidents; he bad them con&s;ider the Trea|&s;ure they were po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of, would be &s;ufficient for them all if they could &s;ecure it in &s;ome Place on Shore; therefore all they had to fear, was &s;ome Misfortune in the Voyage; he bad them con&s;ider the Con&s;equences of being &s;eperated by bad Wea|ther, in which Ca&s;e, the Sloops, if either of them &s;hould fall in with any Ships of Force, mu&s;t be either taken or &s;unk, and the Trea&s;ure on board her lo&s;t to the re&s;t, be&s;ides the common Accidents of the Sea; as for his Part he was &s;o &s;trong, he was able to make his Party good with any Ship they were like to meet in tho&s;e Seas; that if he met with any Ship of &s;uch Strength, that he could not take her, he was &s;afe from being taken, being &s;o well Man'd; be&s;ides his Ship was a quick Sailor, and could carry Sail, when the Sloop could not, wherefore, he propo&s;ed to them, to put the Trea|&s;ure on board his Ship, to &s;eal up each Che&s;t with three Seals, whereof each was to keep one, and to appoint a Rendezvous, in Ca&s;e of Seperation.</P>
<P>Upon con&s;idering this Propo&s;al, it appeared &s;o rea&s;onable to them, that they readily came into it, for they argued to them&s;elves, that an Accident might happen to one of the Sloops and the other e&s;cape, wherefore it was for the common Good. The Thing was done as agreed to, the Trea&s;ure put on Board of <HI>Avery,</HI> and the Che&s;ts &s;eal'd; they kept Company that Day and the next, the Wea|ther being fair, in which Time <HI>Avery</HI> tamper'd with his Men, telling them they now had &s;ufficient to make them all ea&s;y, and what &s;hould hinder

them from going to &s;ome Country, where, they were not known, and living on Shore all the re&s;t of their Days in Plenty; they under&s;tood what he meant: And in &s;hort, they all agreed to bilk their new Allies, the Sloop's Men, nor do I find that any of them felt any Qualms of Honour ri&s;ing in his Stomach, to hinder them from con&s;enting to this Piece of Treachery. In fine, they took Advantage of the Darkne&s;s that Night, &s;teer'd another Cour&s;e, and by Morning lo&s;t Sight of them.</P>
<P>I leave the Reader to judge, what Swearing and Confu&s;ion there was among the Sloop's Men, in the Morning when they &s;aw that <HI>Avery</HI> had given them the Slip; for they knew by the Fairne&s;s of the Weather, and the Cour&s;e they had agreed to &s;teer, that it mu&s;t have been done on purpo&s;e: But we leave them at pre&s;ent to follow Mr. <HI>Avery.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Avery,</HI> and his Men, having con&s;ulted what to do with them&s;elves, came to a Re&s;olution, to make the be&s;t of their Way towards <HI>America;</HI> and none of them being known in tho&s;e Parts, they intended to divide the Trea&s;ure, to change their Names, to go a&s;hore, &s;ome in one Place, &s;ome in other, to purcha&s;e &s;ome Settlements, and live at Ea&s;e. The fir&s;t Land they made, was the I&s;land of <HI>Providence,</HI> then newly &s;ettled; here they &s;taid &s;ome Time, and having con&s;idered that when they &s;hould go to <HI>New-Eng|land,</HI> the Greatne&s;s of their Ship, would cau&s;e much Enquiry about them; and po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome People from <HI>England,</HI> who had heard the Story of a Ship's being run away with from the <HI>Groine,</HI> might &s;u&s;|pect them to be the People; They therefore took a Re&s;olution of di&s;po&s;ing of their Ship at <HI>Providence:</HI> upon which, <HI>Avery</HI> pretending that the Ship being fitted out upon the privateering Account, and ha|ving had no Succe&s;s, he had received Orders from the Owners, to di&s;po&s;e of her to the be&s;t Advan|tage:
<PB N="34" REF="39">
He &s;oon met with a Purcha&s;er, and immedi|ately bought a Sloop.</P>
<P>In this Sloop, he and his Companions embarq'd, they touch'd at &s;everal Parts of <HI>America,</HI> where no Per&s;on &s;u&s;pected them; and &s;ome of them went on Shore, and di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves about the Country, having received &s;uch Dividends as <HI>Avery</HI> would give them; for he concealed the greate&s;t Part of the Diamonds from them, which in the fir&s;t Hurry of plundering the Ship, they did not much regard, as not knowing their Value.</P>
<P>At length he came to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> and &s;eem'd to have a de&s;ire of &s;ettling in tho&s;e Parts, and &s;ome of his Companions went on &s;hore there al&s;o, but he changed his Re&s;olution, and propo&s;ed to the few of his Companions who were left, to &s;ail for <HI>Ireland,</HI> which they con&s;ented to: He found out that <HI>New-England</HI> was not a proper Place for him, becau&s;e a great deal of his Wealth lay in Diamonds; and &s;hould he have produced them there, he would have certainly been &s;eiz'd on Su&s;picion of Pyracy.</P>
<P>In their Voyage to <HI>Ireland,</HI> they avoided St. <HI>Gearge</HI>'s Channel, and &s;ailing North about, they put into one of the Northern Ports of that Kingdom; there they di&s;po&s;ed of their Sloop, and coming on Shore they &s;eperated them&s;elves, &s;ome going to <HI>Cork,</HI> and &s;ome to <HI>Dublin,</HI> and <HI>Avery</HI> never &s;aw any of them after. When he had remain'd &s;ome Time in this Kingdom, he was afraid to offer his Dia|monds to &s;ale, lea&s;t an Enquiry into his Manner of coming by them &s;hould occa&s;ion a Di&s;covery; therefore con&s;idering with him&s;elf what was be&s;t to be done, he fancied there were &s;ome Per&s;ons at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> whom he might venture to tru&s;t; upon which, he re&s;olved to pa&s;s over into <HI>England;</HI> he did &s;o, and going into <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> he &s;ent to one of the&s;e Friends to meet him, at a Town called <HI>Biddi|ford;</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="40">
when he had communicated him&s;elf to his Friend, and con&s;ulted with him about the Means of his Effects, they agreed, that the &s;afe&s;t Method would be, to put them in the Hands of &s;ome Mer|chants, who being Men of Wealth and Credit in the World, no Enquiry would be made how they came by them; this Friend telling him he was very intimate with &s;ome who were very fit for the Pur|po&s;e, and if he would but allow them a good Com|mi&s;&s;ion, would do the Bu&s;ine&s;s very faithfully. <HI>Avery</HI> liked the Propo&s;al, for he found no other Way of managing his Affairs, &s;ince he could not Appear in them him&s;elf; therefore his Friend go|ing back to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and opening the Matter to the Mer|chants, they made <HI>Avery</HI> a Vi&s;it at <HI>Biddiford,</HI> where after &s;ome Prote&s;tations of Honour and Integrity, he delivered them his Effects, con&s;i&s;ting of Dia|monds, and &s;ome Ve&s;&s;els of Gold; they gave him a little Money for his pre&s;ent Sub&s;i&s;tance, and &s;o they parted.</P>
<P>He changed his Name, and lived at <HI>Biddiford,</HI> without making any Figure, and therefore there was no great Notice taken of him; yet he let one or two of his Relations know where he was, who came to &s;ee him. In &s;ome Time his little Money was &s;pent, yet he heard nothing from his Mer|chants; he writ to them often, and after much Im|portunity they &s;ent him a &s;mall Supply, but &s;carce &s;ufficient to pay his Debts: In fine the Supplies they &s;ent him from Time to Time, were &s;o &s;mall, that they were not &s;ufficient to give him Bread, nor could he get that little, without a great deal of Trouble and Importunity, wherefore being weary of his Life, he went privately to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> to &s;peak to the Merchants him&s;elf, where in&s;tead of Money he met a mo&s;t &s;hocking Repul&s;e, for when he de&s;ired them to come to an Account with him they &s;ilenced him by threatning to di&s;cover him,
<PB N="36" REF="41">
&s;o that our Merchants, were as good Pyrates at Land as he was at Sea.</P>
<P>Whether he was frighten'd by the&s;e Menaces, or had &s;een &s;ome Body el&s;e he thought knew him, is not known; but he went immediately over to <HI>Ireland,</HI> and from thence &s;ollicited his Merchants, very hard for a Supply, but to no Purpo&s;e, for he was even reduced to Beggary: In this Extremity he was re&s;olv'd to return and ca&s;t him&s;elf upon them, let the Con&s;equence be what it would. He put him&s;elf on Board a trading Ve&s;&s;el, and work'd his Pa&s;&s;age over to <HI>Plymouth,</HI> from whence he tra|velled on Foot to <HI>Biddiford,</HI> where he had been but a few Days before he fell &s;ick and died; not being worth as much as would buy him a Coffin.</P>
<P>Thus have I given, all that could be collected of any Certainty concerning this Man; rejecting the idle Stories, which were made of his fanta&s;tick Greatne&s;s, by which it appears, that his Actions were more incon&s;iderable, than tho&s;e of other Py|rates, &s;ince him, though he made more Noi&s;e in the World.</P>
<P>Now, we &s;hall turn back and give our Readers &s;ome Account of what became of the too Sloops.</P>
<P>We took Notice, of the Rage and Confu&s;ion, which mu&s;t have &s;eized them, upon their mi&s;&s;ing of <HI>Avery;</HI> however, they continued their Cour&s;e, &s;ome of them &s;till flattering them&s;elves, that he had only outfail'd them in the Night, and that they &s;hould find him at the Place of Rendezvous: But when they came there, and could hear no Ty|dings of him, there was an end of Hope. It was Time to con&s;ider, what they &s;hould do with them|&s;elves, their &s;tock of Sea Provi&s;ion was almo&s;t &s;pent, and tho' there was Rice, and Fi&s;h, and Fowl, to be had a&s;hore, yet the&s;e would not keep for Sea, without being properly cured with Salt, which they had no Conveniency of doing; therefore,
<PB N="37" REF="42">
&s;ince they could not go a Cruizing any more, it was Time to think of e&s;tabli&s;hing them&s;elves at Land; to which Purpo&s;e, they took all Things out of the Sloops, made Tents of the Sails, and encamp|ed them&s;elves, having a large Quantity of Ammu|nition, and abundance of &s;mall Arms.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the Natives of <HI>Madaga&s;|car,</HI> are a kind of Negroes, they differ from tho&s;e of <HI>Guiney,</HI> in their Hair, which is long, and their Complexion is not &s;o good a Jet; they have innu|merable little Princes, among them, who are con|tinually making War, upon one another; their Pri|&s;oners are their Slaves, and they either &s;ell them, or put them to Death, as they plea&s;e: When our Pyrates fir&s;t &s;ettled among&s;t them, their Alliance was much courted by the&s;e Princes, &s;o they &s;ome|times joined one, &s;ometimes another, but where&s;o|ever they &s;ided, they were &s;ure to be Victorious; for the Negroes here, had no Fire Arms, nor did they under&s;tand their U&s;e; &s;o that at length, the&s;e Pyrates became &s;o terrible to the Negroes, that if two or three of them, were only &s;een on one Side, when they were going to engage, the oppo&s;ite Side would fly, without &s;triking a Blow.</P>
<P>By the&s;e Means, they not only became feared, but powerful; all the Pri&s;oners of War, they took to be their Slaves, they married the mo&s;t beautiful of the Negroe Women, not one or two, but as many as they liked; &s;o that every one of them had as great a Seraglio as the Grand Seignior at <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople:</HI> Their Slaves they employed in planting Rice, in Fi&s;hing, Hunting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> be&s;ides which, they had abundance of others, who lived as it were, under their Protection, and to be &s;ecure from the Di&s;tur|bances or Attacks, from their powerful Neighbours; the&s;e &s;eemed to pay them a willing Homage. Now they began to divide from one another, each living with his own Wives, Slaves, and Dependants, like
<PB N="38" REF="43">
a &s;eparate Prince; and as Power and Plenty natu|rally beget Contention, they &s;ometimes quarrelled with one another, and attack'd each other at the Head of their &s;everal Armies; and in the&s;e civil Wars, many of them were kill'd, but an Accident happened, which obliged them to Unite again, for their common Safety.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be ob&s;erv'd, that the&s;e &s;udden great Men, had u&s;ed their Power like Tyrants, for they grew wanton in Cruelty, and nothing was more com|mon, than upon the &s;lighte&s;t Di&s;plea&s;ure, to cau&s;e one of their Dependants to be tied to a Tree, and &s;hot thro' the Heart, let the Crime be what it would, whether little or great, this was always the Puni&s;hment; wherefore, the Negroes con&s;pi|red together, to rid them&s;elves of the&s;e De&s;troyers, all in one Night; and as they now liv'd &s;eparate, the Thing might ea&s;ily have been done, had not a Woman, who had been Wife or Concubine to one of them, run near twenty Miles in three Hours, to di&s;cover the Matter to them: Immediately upon the Alarm they ran together as fa&s;t as they could, &s;o that when the Negroes approached them, they found them all up in Arms; wherefore they retired without making any Attempt.</P>
<P>This E&s;cape, made them very cautious from that Time, and it will be worth while, to de&s;cribe the Policy of the&s;e Bruti&s;h Fellows, and to &s;hew what Mea&s;ures they took to &s;ecure them&s;elves.</P>
<P>They found that the Fear of their Power could not &s;ecure them again&s;t a Surprize, and the brave&s;t Man may be kill'd when he is a&s;leep, by one much his infe|rior in Courage and Strength; therefore, as their fir&s;t Security, they did all they could to foment War betwixt the Neighbouring Negroes, remaining Neuter them&s;elves; by which means, tho&s;e who were overcome, con&s;tantly fled to them for Protection, otherwi&s;e they mu&s;t be either killed,
<PB N="39" REF="44">
or made Slaves. They &s;trengthen'd their Party, and tied &s;ome to them by Intere&s;t; when there was no War, they contrived to &s;pirit up private Quar|rels among&s;t them; and upon every little Di&s;pute or Mi&s;under&s;tanding, pu&s;h on one Side, or other, to Revenge; in&s;truct them how to Attack or Surprize their Adver&s;aries, and lend them loaded Pi&s;tols, or Firelocks to di&s;patch them with; the Con&s;e|quence of which was, that the Murderer was forc'd to fly to them, for the &s;afety of his Life, with his Wives, Children, and Kindred.</P>
<P>Such as the&s;e were fa&s;t Friends, as their Lives de|pended upon the &s;afety of his Protectors; for as we ob&s;erved before, our Pyrates were grown &s;o terri|ble, that none of their Neighbours had Re&s;olution enough to Attack them in an open War.</P>
<P>By &s;uch Arts as the&s;e, in the Space of a few Years, their Body was greatly increa&s;ed, they then began to &s;eparate them&s;elves, and remove at a greater Di&s;tance from one another, for the Conve|nience of more Ground, and were divided like Jews, into Tribes, each carrying with him, his Wives and Children, (of which, by this Time they had a large Family,) as al&s;o their Quota of Dependants and Followers; and if Power and Command, be the Thing which di&s;tingui&s;h a Prince, the&s;e Ru&s;&s;ians had all the Marks of Royalty about them, nay more, they had the very Fears which commonly di&s;turb Tyrants, as may be &s;een by the extream Caution they took in fortifying the Places where they dwelt.</P>
<P>In this Plan of Fortification they imitated one another, their Dwellings were rather Citadels than Hou&s;es; they made Choice of a Place overgrown with Wood, and &s;cituate near a Water; they rai&s;ed a Rampart, or high Ditch round it, &s;o &s;trait and high, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to climb it; and e&s;pecially by tho&s;e who had not the U&s;e of &s;caleing Ladders:
<PB N="40" REF="45">
Over this Ditch there was one Pa&s;&s;age into this Wood; the Dwelling which was a Hut, was built in that Part of the Wood which the Prince, who inhabited it, thought fit, but &s;o covered, that it could not be &s;een till you came at it; but the greate&s;t Cunning lay in the Pa&s;&s;age which lead to the Hut, which was &s;o narrow, that no more than one Per&s;on could go a Brea&s;t, and contrived in &s;o intri|cate a Manner, that it was a perfect Maze or Laby|rinth, it being round, and round, with &s;everal lit|tle cro&s;s Ways, &s;o that a Per&s;on that was not well acquainted with the Way, might walk &s;everal Hours round, and cro&s;s the&s;e Ways without be|ing able to find the Hut; moreover all along the Sides of the&s;e narrow Paths, certain large Thorns, which grew upon a Tree, in that Country, were &s;truck into the Ground with their Points upper|mo&s;t, and the Path it &s;elf, being made Crooked and Serpentine, if a Man &s;hould Attempt to come near the Hut at Night, he would certainly have &s;truck upon the&s;e Thorns, tho' he had been provided with that Clue, which <HI>Ariadne,</HI> gave to <HI>The&s;eus,</HI> when he entered the Cave of the <HI>Minataur.</HI></P>
<P>Thus Tyrant like they lived, fearing and fear'd by all; and in this Scituation they were found by Captain <HI>Woods R$gers,</HI> when he went to <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> in the <HI>Delicia,</HI> a Ship of 40 Guns; with a De&s;ign of buying Slaves, in order to &s;ell to the <HI>Dutch</HI> at <HI>Batavia,</HI> or <HI>New-Holland:</HI> He happened to touch up|on a Part of the I&s;land, where no Ship had been &s;een for &s;even or eight Years before, where he met with &s;ome of the&s;e Pyrates, at which Time, they had been upon the I&s;land above 25 Years, having a large motly Generation of Children, and Grand Children de&s;cended from them, there being about that Time, eleven of them remaining alive.</P>
<P>Upon their fir&s;t &s;eeing a Ship of this Force and Burthen, they &s;u&s;pected it to be a Man of War,
<PB N="41" REF="46">
&s;ent to take them; they therefore lurked within their Fa&s;tne&s;&s;es, but when &s;ome from the Ship came on Shore, without any &s;hew of Ho&s;tility, and offer|ing to Trade with the Negroes, they ventured to come out of their Holes, attended like Princes; and &s;ince they actually are Kings <HI>De Facto,</HI> which is a Kind of a Right, we ought to &s;peak of them as &s;uch.</P>
<P>Having been &s;o many Years upon this I&s;land, it may be imagined, their Cloaths had long been worn out, &s;o that their Maje&s;ties were extreamly out at the Elbows; I cannot &s;ay they were ragged, &s;ince they had no Cloaths, they had nothing to cover them, but the Skins of Bea&s;ts, without any tanning, but with all the Hair on, nor a Shoe nor Stocking, &s;o that they looked like the Pictures of <HI>Hercules,</HI> in the Lion's Skin; and being overgrown with Beard, and Hair upon their Bodies, they ap|peared the mo&s;t Savage Figures that a Man's Ima|gination can frame.</P>
<P>However, they &s;oon got rigg'd, for they &s;old great Numbers of tho&s;e poor People under them, for Cloaths, Knives, Saws, Powder and Ball, and many other Things, and became &s;o familiar that they went on Board the <HI>Delicia,</HI> and were ob&s;erved to be very curious, examining the in&s;ide of the Ship, and very familiar with the Men, inviting them a&s;hore. Their De&s;ign in doing this, as they after|wards confe&s;&s;ed, was to try, if it was not practi|cable to &s;urprize the Ship in the Night, which they judged very ea&s;y, in Ca&s;e there was but a &s;lender Watch kept on Board, they having Boats, and Men enough at Command, but it &s;eems the Captain was aware of them, and kept &s;o &s;trong a Watch upon Deck, that they found it was in vain to make any Attempt; wherefore, when &s;ome of the Men went a&s;hore, they were for inveigling them, and drawing them into a Plot, for &s;eizing the Cap|tain,
<PB N="42" REF="47">
and &s;ecuring the re&s;t of the Men under Hatches, when they &s;hould have the Night-Watch, promi&s;ing a Signal to come on Board to join them; propo&s;ing, if they &s;ucceeded, to go a Pyrating to|gether, not doubting, but with that Ship, they &s;hould be able to take any Thing they met in the Sea: But the Captain ob&s;erving an Intimacy grow|ing betwixt them, and &s;ome of his Men, thought it could be for no good; he therefore broke it off in Time, not &s;uffering them &s;o much as to talk to|gether, and when he &s;ent a Boat on Shore with an Officer to treat with them, about the Sale of Slaves, the Crew remain'd on Board the Boat, and no Man was &s;uffered to talk with them, but the Per&s;on de|puted by him, for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Before he &s;ailed away, and they found that no|thing was to be done, they confe&s;&s;ed all the De&s;igns, they had formed again&s;t him. Thus he left them, as he found them, in a great deal of dirty State, and Royalty, but with fewer Subjects than they had, having as we ob&s;erved, &s;old many of them; and if Ambition be the darling Pa&s;&s;ion of Men, no doubt they were happy. One of the&s;e great Prin|ces had formerly been a Waterman upon the <HI>Thames,</HI> where having committed a Murder, he fled to the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> and was of the Number of tho&s;e who run away with the Sloops, the re&s;t had been all &s;orema&s;t Men, nor was there a Man among&s;t them, who could either read or write, and yet their Secretaries of State had no more Learning than them&s;elves. This is all the Account we can give of the&s;e Kings of <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> &s;ome of whom it is probable are reigning to this Day.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>Of the Growth of the Pyrates in the</HI> We&s;t-Indies, <HI>their Settlement in</HI> Providence, <HI>and the Arrival of Governor</HI> Rogers, <HI>at that I&s;land.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Ri&s;e of the Pyrates &s;ince the late War with <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> or at lea&s;t the En|crea&s;e of them has been principally owing to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies;</HI> who on Pretence of &s;ecuring their Trade, and preventing Interlo|pers, carry on a Kind of a War again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants Ships, by their <HI>Guarda del Co&s;ta,</HI> or Guard Ships; and Complaint being made thereof, to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Governors, the Merchants were never able to procure Satisfaction, for the Lo&s;&s;es at any Time &s;u&s;tained by the&s;e <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Pyrates; which was Pro|vocation enough to them to Attempt &s;omething again&s;t the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> by way of Repri&s;al; and a fair Opportunity offering it &s;elf in the Year 1716, the Traders of the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> took Care not to &s;lip it over, but made the be&s;t U&s;e of it their Circum|&s;tances would permit them.</P>
<P>It was about two Years before, that the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Galleons or Plate Fleet, had been Ca&s;t away, in the Gulf of <HI>Florida;</HI> and &s;everal Ve&s;&s;els from the <HI>Havana,</HI> were at Work, with diving Engines, to Fi&s;h up the Silver that was on board the Galleons.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards,</HI> had recovered &s;ome Millions of Peices of Eight, and had carried it all to the <HI>Ha|vana;</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="49">
but they had at pre&s;ent about 350000 Peices of Eight in Silver, then upon the Spot, and were daily taking up more. In the mean time, two Ships, and three Sloops, fitted out from <HI>Jamaica, Barbad$es, &amp;c.</HI> and go away to the Gulph, and find the <HI>Spaniards</HI> there upon the Wreck; the Money be|fore &s;poken of, was left on Shore, depo&s;ited in a Store-Hou&s;e, under the Government of two Com|mi&s;&s;aries, and a Guard of about 60 Soldiers.</P>
<P>The Rovers came directly upon the Place, bring their little Fleet to an Anchor, and in a Word, landing 300 Men, they attack'd the Guard, who immediately run away; and thus they &s;eized the Trea&s;ure, which they carried off, making the be&s;t of their Way to <HI>Jamaica.</HI></P>
<P>In their Way, they unhappily met with a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ship, bound from <HI>Proto Bello</HI> to the <HI>Havana,</HI> with a great many rich Goods, <HI>viz.</HI> Bales of Cochineal, Casks of Indico, and 60000 Peices of Eight more, which, their Hands being in, they took, and having rifled the Ve&s;&s;el let her go.</P>
<P>They went away to <HI>Jamaica</HI> with their Booty, and were followed thither, that is in View of the Port, by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who having &s;een them thi|ther, went back to the Governour of the <HI>Havana,</HI> with the Account of it, who immediately &s;ent a Ve&s;&s;el to the Governour of <HI>Jamaica</HI> to complain of this Robberry, and to reclaim the Goods.</P>
<P>As it was in full Peace, and contrary to all Ju&s;tice and Right, that this Fact was committed, they were &s;oon made &s;en&s;ible, that the Government at <HI>Jamaica</HI> would not &s;uffer them to go unpuni&s;hed, much le&s;s protect them. Therefore they &s;aw a Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;hifting for them&s;elves; &s;o to make bad wor&s;e, they went to Sea again, tho' not without di&s;po&s;ing their Cargo to good Advantage, and fur|ni&s;hing them&s;elves with Ammunition, Provi&s;ions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and being thus made de&s;perate, they turn'd
<PB N="45" REF="50">
Pyrates, robbing not the <HI>Spaniards</HI> only, but their own Countrymen, and any Nation, they could lay their Hands on.</P>
<P>It happened about this Time, that the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> with three or four &s;mall Men of War, fell upon our Logwood Cutters, in the Bay of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> and Bay of <HI>Honduras;</HI> and after they had made Prizes of the following Ships and Ve&s;&s;els, they gave the Men belonging to them, three Sloops to carry them home, but the&s;e Men being made de&s;perate by their Misfortunes, and meeting with the Pyrates, they took on with them, and &s;o encreas'd their Number.</P>

Tho the&s;e Pyrates con&s;orted together, they were not under the Government of one particular Head, as Admiral, but each Captain and Company were regulated by their own Laws, independently of the re&s;t; nor were the Captains them&s;elves always obey'd, every thing of Moment being carried by the Vote of the Company, the Captain having only a double Vote in all Elections; and all Prizes that were taken, were divided equally between the Men who took them, whether they were in one Ship or Ve&s;&s;el, or two, or three; the Captains receiving two Shares, and the Officers a Share and a half, and others a &s;hare and quarter, and a &s;ingle &s;hare to each private Man; but, upon any notable Piece of Service, the principal Pyrates would take upon them, to give away a quarter, or a half Share of one Man's, whom they found remi&s;s in their Duty, to another whom they e&s;teem'd of more Worth and Merit.</P>
<P>The Rovers being now pretty &s;trong, they con|&s;ulted together, about getting &s;ome Place of Re|treat, where they might lodge their Wealth, clean and repair their Ships, and make them&s;elves a kind of Abode. They were not long in re&s;olving, but fixed upon the I&s;land of <HI>Providence,</HI> the mo&s;t con&s;i|derable of the <HI>Bahama</HI> I&s;lands, lying in the Latti|tude of about 24 Degrees North, and to the Ea&s;t|ward of the <HI>Spani&s;h Florida.</HI></P>
<P>This I&s;land, is about 28 Miles long, and eleven where broade&s;t, and has a Harbour big enough to hold 500 Sail of Ships; before which lyes a &s;mall I&s;land, which makes two Inlets to the Harbour, at either Way there is a Bar, over which no Ship of 500 Tun can pa&s;s.

carried off half the Blacks, and the re&s;t of the People who fled to the Woods, retired afterwards to <HI>Carolina,</HI> &s;ince which time they have been neglected, notwith&s;tanding the great Advantage they are of in time of War; for the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Plate Fleet are oblig|ed to pa&s;s very near them in their Voyages home|ward to the <HI>Havana,</HI> and con&s;equently lay fair to be di&s;turbed in their Pa&s;&s;age by Ships belong|ing to the&s;e Settlements.</P>
<P><Q>In <HI>March,</HI> 1705-6, the Hou&s;e of Lords did in an Addre&s;s to her late Maje&s;ty &s;et forth, &startq;That the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> had twice, during the Time of the War, over run and plundered the <HI>Bahama</HI> I&s;lands, that there was no Form of Government there: That the Harbour of the I&s;le of Providence, might be ea&s;ily put in a Po&s;ture of Defence, and that it would be of dangerous Con&s;equence, &s;hould tho&s;e I&s;lands fall into the Hands of the Enemy; wherefore the Lords humbly be&s;ought her Ma|je&s;ty, to u&s;e &s;uch Methods, as &s;he &s;hould think proper for taking the &s;aid I&s;land into her Hands, in Order to &s;ecure the &s;ame to the Crown of this Kingdom, and to the Security, and Advantage&endq; of the Trade thereof.</Q></P>

<P>God &s;ave the KING.</P>
<P>In the Month of <HI>May or June,</HI> 1718, Captain <HI>Rogers</HI> arrived at the Place of his Government, in his Maje&s;ty's Ship <HI>Melford,</HI> in the Company of ano|ther of his Maje&s;ty's Ships, I think the <HI>Mermaid,</HI> and found in <HI>Providence</HI> Harbour, about 25 Sail of Ships and Ve&s;&s;els, being &s;everal of the Pyrates, with their Prizes, the principal of which, were <HI>Vane, Hornigold,</HI> and <HI>Burge&s;s;</HI> Major <HI>Bonnet,</HI> Major <HI>Penner,</HI> Captain <HI>Jennings,</HI> Captain <HI>Williams,</HI> and others were cruizing for Prey; the particular Hi&s;tories of whom we &s;hall give in their Order, after we have given &s;ome little Account of the Affairs of this Place.</P>
<P>In the entering of <HI>Providence,</HI> there happened to be &s;ome &s;mall Mi&s;management, by which the mo&s;t notorious Rover e&s;caped, which was in this Manner. I have before de&s;cribed the Harbour to have two Inlets, by means of a &s;mall I&s;land lying at the Mouth; at each of which, one of the Men of War &s;hould have &s;ailed in; or it they had thought there had not been Water enough one Way, for the Ship's Draught, a Man of War might have block'd up one Pa&s;&s;age, while the other had entered, and brought all the Pyrates to the Terms they required, which was only to have accepted of his Maje&s;ty's Mercy, pur&s;uant to the Proclamation; but both the Men of War going in at the &s;ame Channel, <HI>Vane,</HI> as &s;oon as he perceived them, Slips his Cable, &s;ets Fire to his Prize, and re&s;olutely Sails out at the other; and notwith&s;tanding Governor <HI>Rogers</HI> &s;ent a Boat with the Proclamation on Board of <HI>Vane,</HI> he
<PB N="52" REF="57">
ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed to accept of Grace, but fired &s;everal Guns at the Man of War, and got clear off, tho' he reign'd not long afterwards, as I &s;hall &s;hew in its Place. All the re&s;t &s;urrendred to his Maje&s;ty's Pardon, and had Certificates given them by the Governor, to the Number of between four and five hundred.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Captain <HI>Rogers</HI> had &s;ettled him&s;elf in his Government, he built a Fort for his Defence, and Garri&s;oned it with the People he found upon the I&s;land, and the quondam Pyrates he formed into Companies, appointing Officers of tho&s;e whom he mo&s;t confided in, and then &s;et about to &s;ettle a Trade with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> in the Gulf of <HI>Mexico;</HI> in one of which Voyages, Captain <HI>Burge&s;s</HI> above mentioned, died, and Captain <HI>Hornigold,</HI> another of the famous Pyrates, was Ca&s;t away upon Rocks, a great Way from Land, and peri&s;hed, but five of his Men got into a Canoe, and were &s;av'd.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Rogers,</HI> &s;ent out a Sloop to get Provi|&s;ions, and gave the Command to one <HI>John Augur,</HI> one of the Pyrates, who had accepted of the Act of Grace; in their Voyage they met with two Sloops, and <HI>John,</HI> and his Comrades, not yet for|geting their old Bu&s;ine&s;s, made U&s;e of their former Freedom, and took out of them in Money and Goods, to the Value of about 500 l. after this they &s;teer'd away for <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> not being &s;atisfy'd whe|ther the Governor would admit them to carry on two Trades at once, and &s;o thought to have bidden Farewel to the <HI>Bahama</HI> I&s;lands; but as ill Luck would have it, they met with a violent Turnado, wherein they lo&s;t their Ma&s;t, and were drove back to one of the uninhabited <HI>Bahama</HI>'s, and lo&s;t their Sloop; the Men got all a&s;hore, and lived up and down in the Woods, for a little Time, till Governor <HI>Rogers</HI> happening to hear of their Expedition, and where
<PB N="53" REF="58">
they had got to, &s;ent out an armed Sloop to the afore&s;aid I&s;land; the Ma&s;ter of which, with good Words, and fair Promi&s;es, got them on Board, and brought them all to <HI>Providence,</HI> being eleven Per&s;ons, ten of which were try'd at a Court of Ad|miralty, convicted and hanged, by the other's Evi|dence, in the Sight of all their former Compa|nions, and fellow Thieves. The Criminals, would fain have &s;pirited up the pardon'd Pyrates, to re&s;cue them out of the Hands of the Officers of Ju&s;tice, telling them, from the Gallows, that, <HI>They never thought to have &s;een the Time, when ten &s;uch Men as they, &s;hould be ty'd up, and hanged like Dogs, and four hundred of their &s;worn Friends and Companions, quietly &s;tanding by to behold the Spectacle.</HI> One <HI>Humphrey Mor|rice</HI> urged the Matter farther than the re&s;t, taxing them with Pu&s;ilanimity and Cowardice, as if it were a Breach of Duty in them not to Ri&s;e, and &s;ave them from the ignominious Death they were going to &s;uffer. But, 'twas all in vain, they were not told, it was their Bu&s;ine&s;s to turn their Minds to another World, and &s;incerely to Repent of what Wickedne&s;s they had done in this. <HI>Yes,</HI> an|&s;wered one of them, <HI>I do heartily Repent; I Repent I had not done more Mi&s;chief, and that we did not cut the Throats of them that took us, and I am extremely &s;orry that you an't all hang'd, as well as we. So do I,</HI> &s;ays another. <HI>And I,</HI> &s;ays a third; and then they were all turned off, without making any other dying Speeches, except one <HI>Dennis Macarty,</HI> who told the People, <HI>That &s;ome Friends of his had often &s;aid he &s;hould die in his Shoes, but that he would make them Lyars,</HI> and &s;o kicked them off. And thus ended the Lives, with their Adventures, of tho&s;e mi&s;erable Wretches, who may &s;erve as &s;ad Examples of the little Effect Mercy has upon Men once abandon'd to an evil Cour&s;e of Life. I proceed now to the particular Hi|&s;tory of the re&s;t, and others that took up the Trade

afterwards, and I doubt, &s;hall be obliged to pur|&s;ue their Hi&s;tories, as far as I have done the&s;e ju&s;t mentioned, <HI>viz,</HI> to the Gallows, and there to take my leave of them.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. OF Captain <HI>MARTEL,</HI> And his CREW.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Pyrate was one of the fir&s;t who took up the Trade &s;ince the Peace of <HI>&V;trecht.</HI> It is to be ob&s;erved, that in War-Time, there are none at all, becau&s;e &s;o many arm'd Ve&s;&s;els being continually in Commi&s;&s;ion, and going out again&s;t their Enemies, it would render the Bu&s;ine&s;s too preca|rious, as well as hazardous; and &s;ince in Time of War, any Ve&s;lel may obtain Commi&s;&s;ion from the Governors of I&s;lands, and Provinces, to whom Application is made, to attack, plunder, and de|&s;troy, all Ships and Ve&s;&s;els, belonging to the Prince or Country they are in War with, none will be &s;o fooli&s;h, as to prey at large on the Seas, e&s;peci|ally in Time of Danger, and run the Hazard of their Necks, when they may have a lawful Au|thority for doing the &s;ame Thing, only with &s;ome Re&s;trictions.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="60">
The Multitude of Men and Ve&s;&s;els, employ'd this, Way in Time of War, in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> is ano|ther Rea&s;on, for the Number of Pyrates in a Time of Peace: This cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to be a Re|flection on any of our <HI>American</HI> Governments, much le&s;s on the King him&s;elf, by who&s;e Authority &s;uch Commi&s;&s;ions are granted, becau&s;e of the Rea&s;ona|blene&s;s, and ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity, there is for the doing of it; yet the Ob&s;ervation is ju&s;t, for &s;o many idle People employing them&s;elves in Privateers, for the &s;ake of Plunder and Riches, which they al|ways &s;pend as fa&s;t as they get, that when the War is over, and they can have no farther Bu&s;ine&s;s in the Way of Life they have been u&s;ed to, they too readily engage in Acts of Pyracy, which being but the &s;ame Practice without Commi&s;&s;ion, they make very little Di&s;tinction betwixt the Law|fulne&s;s of one, and the Unlawfulne&s;s of the other.</P>
<P>I have not enquired &s;o far back, as to know the Original of this Rover, but I believe he and his Gang, were &s;ome Privateer's Men belonging to the I&s;land of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> in the preceeding War; his Story is but &s;hort, for his Reign was &s;o; an End ha|ving been put to his Adventures in good Time, when he was growing &s;trong and formidable. We find him Commander of a Pyrate Sloop of eight Guns, and 80 Men, in the Month of <HI>September,</HI> 1716 crui&s;ing off <HI>Jamaica, Cuba, &amp;c.</HI> about which Time he took the <HI>Berkley</HI> Galley, Captain <HI>Saunders,</HI> and plundered him of 1000 l. in Money, and after|wards met with a Ship called the <HI>King Solomon,</HI> from whom he took &s;ome Money, and Provi&s;ions, be|&s;ides Goods, to a good Value.</P>
<P>They proceeded to the Port of <HI>Cavena,</HI> at the I&s;land of <HI>Cuba,</HI> and in their Way took two Sloops, which they plundered, and let go; and off the Port fell in with a fine Galley, with 20 Guns,
<PB N="56" REF="61">
called the <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Martha,</HI> Captain <HI>Wil&s;on,</HI> which they attack'd under their pyratical Black-Flag, and made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of her. They put &s;ome of the Men a&s;hore, and others they detain'd, as they had done &s;everal others, to encrea&s;e their Company, but Captain <HI>Martel,</HI> charged Captain <HI>Wil&s;on,</HI> to advi&s;e his Owners, that their Ship would an&s;wer his Purpo&s;e exactly, by taking one Deck down, and as for the Cargo, which con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of Logwood and Sugar, he would take Care it &s;hould be carry'd to a good Market.</P>
<P>Having fitted up the afore&s;aid Ship, as they de|&s;igned, they mounted her with 22 Guns, 100 Men, and left 25 Hands in the Sloop, and &s;o proceeded to Cruize off the Leeward I&s;lands, where they met with but too much Succe&s;s. After the taking of a Sloop and a Brigantine, they gave Cha&s;e to a &s;tout Ship, which they came up with, and at Sight of the Pyrate's Flag, &s;he &s;truck to the Robbers, being a Ship of 20 Guns, called the <HI>Dolphin,</HI> bound for <HI>Newfoundland;</HI> Captain <HI>Martel</HI> made the Men Pri&s;oners, and carry'd the Ship with him.</P>
<P>The middle of <HI>December</HI> the Pyrates took ano|ther Galley in her Voyage home from <HI>Jamaica,</HI> called the <HI>Kent,</HI> Captain <HI>Lawton,</HI> and &s;hifted her Provi|&s;ions aboard their own Ship, and let her go, which obliged her to Sail back to <HI>Jamaica</HI> for a Supply for her Voyage. After this they met with a &s;mall Ship and a Sloop, belonging to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> out of both they took Provi&s;ions, and then parted with them, having fir&s;t taken out &s;ome of their Hands, who were willing to be forced to go along with them. The <HI>Greyhound</HI> Galley of <HI>London,</HI> Captain <HI>Evans,</HI> from <HI>Guiney,</HI> to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> was the next that had the Mis|fortune to fall in their Way, which they did not detain long, for as &s;oon as they could get out all her Gold Du&s;t, Elephant's Teeth, and 40 Slaves, they &s;ent her onwards upon her Voyage.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="62">
They concluded now, that 'twas high Time to get into Harbour and refit, as well as to get Re|fre&s;hments them&s;elves, and wait an Opportunity to di&s;po&s;e of their Cargo; therefore 'twas re&s;ol|ved to make the be&s;t of their Way to <HI>Santa Crux,</HI> a &s;mall I&s;land in the Lattitude of 18, 30, N. ten Mile long, and two broad, lying South Ea&s;t of <HI>Porto Rico,</HI> belonging to the <HI>French</HI> Settlements. Here they thought they might lye privately enough for &s;ome Time, and fit them&s;elves for further Mis|chief. They met with a Sloop by the Way, which they took along with them, and in the Beginning of the Year 1716-17, they arrived at their Port, having a Ship of 20 Guns, a Sloop of eight, and three Prizes <HI>viz.</HI> another Ship of 20 Guns, a Sloop of four Guns, and another Sloop la&s;t taken; with this little Fleet, they got into a &s;mall Harbour or Road, the N. W. Part of the I&s;land, and warp'd up two Creeks, which were made by a little I&s;land lying within the Bay; (I am the more particular now, becau&s;e I &s;hall take leave of the Gentlemen, at this Place.) They had here bare 16 Foot Water, at the deepe&s;t, and but 13 or 14, at the &s;hallow|e&s;t, and nothing but Rocks and Sands without, which &s;ecured them from Wind and Sea, and likewi&s;e from any con&s;iderable Force coming again&s;t them.</P>
<P>When they had all got in, the fir&s;t Thing they had to do, was to Guard them&s;elves in the be&s;t Manner they could; they made a Battery of four Guns upon the I&s;land, and another Battery of two Guns on the North Point of the Road, and warp'd one of the Sloops with eight Guns, at the Mouth of the Channel, to hinder any Ve&s;&s;els from coming in; when this was done they went to Work on their Ship, unrigging, and unloading, in order to Clean, where I &s;hall leave them a while, till I bring other Company to 'em.</P>

In the Month of <HI>November,</HI> 1716, General <HI>Ha|milton,</HI> Commander in chief of all the <HI>Leeward Car|ribee I&s;lands,</HI> &s;ent a Sloop Expre&s;s to Captain <HI>Hume,</HI> at <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> Commander of his Maje&s;ty's Ship, <HI>Scarborough,</HI> of 30 Guns, and 140 Men, to acquaint him, that two Pyrate Sloops of 12 Guns each, mole&s;ted the Colonies, having plundered &s;everal Ve&s;&s;els. The <HI>Scarborough</HI> had buryed twenty Men, and had near forty Sick, and therefore was but in ill State to go to Sea: However, Captain <HI>Hume</HI> left his Sick Men behind, and &s;ailed to the other I&s;lands, for a &s;upply of Men, taking 20 Soldiers from <HI>Antegoa;</HI> at <HI>Nevis,</HI> he took 10, and 10 at St. <HI>Chri&s;tophers,</HI> and then &s;ailed to the I&s;land of <HI>An|guilla,</HI> where he learned, that &s;ometime before, two &s;uch Sloops had been at <HI>Spani&s;h-Town,</HI> otherwi&s;e, called, one of the <HI>Virgin</HI> I&s;lands: Accordingly, the next Day, the <HI>Scarborough</HI> came to <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Town, but could hear no News of the Sloops, only, that they had been there about <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> (it being then the 15th of <HI>January.)</HI></P>
<P>Captain <HI>Hume,</HI> finding no Account could be had of the&s;e Pyrates, de&s;igned to go back, the next Day, to <HI>Barbadoes;</HI> but, it happened, that Night, that a Boat anchor'd there from <HI>Santa Crux,</HI> and infor|med him, that he &s;aw a Pyrate Ship of 22 or 24 Guns, with other Ve&s;&s;els, going in to the North We&s;t Part of the I&s;land afore&s;aid. The <HI>Scarborough</HI> weigh'd immediately, and the next Morning came in Sight of the Rovers, and their Prizes, and &s;tood to them, but the Pilot refu&s;ed to venture in with the Ship; all the while the Pyrates fir'd red hot Bullets from the Shore. At length, the Ship came to an Anchor, along Side the Reef, near the Chan|nel, and cannonaded for &s;everal Hours, both the Ve&s;&s;els and Batteries: About four in the Af|ternoon, the Sloop, that guarded the Channel was &s;unk, by the Shot of the Man of War; then &s;he
<PB N="59" REF="64">
cannonaded the Pyrate Ship of 22 Guns, that lay behind the I&s;land. The next Night, viz. the 18th, it falling Calm, Captain <HI>Hume</HI> weigh'd, fearing he might fall on the Reef, and &s;o &s;tood off and on for a Day or two, to block them up. On the 20th, in the Evening, they ob&s;erved the Man of War to &s;tand off to Sea, and took the Opportunity to warp out, in order to &s;lip away from the I&s;land; but at Twelve o'Clock they run a Ground, and then &s;eeing the <HI>Scarborough</HI> about, &s;tanding in again, as their Ca&s;e was de&s;perate, &s;o they were put into the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion; they quitted their Ship, and &s;et her on Fire, with 20 Negroes in her, who were all burnt; 19 of the Pyrates made their E&s;cape in a &s;mall Sloop, but the Captain and the re&s;t, with 20 Negroes, betook to the Woods, where 'twas probable they might &s;tarve, for 'twas never heard what became of 'em afterwards: Cap|tain <HI>Hume</HI> relea&s;ed the Pri&s;oners, with the Ship and Sloop that remained, and then went after the two Pyrate Sloops fir&s;t mentioned.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. OF Major <HI>STEDE BONNET,</HI> And his CREW.</HEAD>
<P>THE Major was a Gentleman of good Re|putation in the I&s;land of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> was Ma&s;ter of a plentiful Fortune, and had the Advantage of a liberal Education. He had the lea&s;t Temptation of any Man to follow &s;uch a Cour&s;e of Life, for his Condition was &s;uperior to any Thing that could have been expected from the mo&s;t fortunate Adventures in the pyratical Way: It was &s;urprizing to every one, to hear of the Major's Enterprize, in the I&s;land where he lived: and as he was generally e&s;teem'd and honour|ed, before he broke out into open Acts of Pyracy, &s;o he was afterwards rather pitty'd than condem|ned, by tho&s;e that had been acquainted with him, believing that his Humour of going a pyrating, proceeded from a Di&s;order in his Mind, which had been but too vi&s;ible in him, &s;ome Time before this wicked Undertaking. Nor was the Major at all qualified for this Bu&s;ine&s;s, he not being ac|quainted with Sea Affairs, but had always lived at Land, in a peaceable and creditable manner, with a &s;eeming Sen&s;e of Virtue and Religion; in&s;omuch, that any one would have thought him Proof again&s;t
<PB N="61" REF="66">
&s;uch an abominable Practice; if the Danger and Hazard attending it, had not been &s;ufficient to have created in him an Abhorrence of that Way of Living.</P>
<P>However, Major <HI>Bonnet,</HI> fitted out a Sloop with ten Guns, and 70 Men, entirely at his own Ex|pence, and in the Night-Time &s;ailed from <HI>Barba|does.</HI> He called his Sloop the <HI>Revenge;</HI> his fir&s;t Cruize was off the Capes of <HI>Virginia,</HI> where he took &s;everal Ships, and plundered them of Provi&s;ions, Cloaths, Money, Ammunition, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in particular the <HI>Ann,</HI> Capt <HI>Montgomery,</HI> from <HI>Gla&s;cow;</HI> the <HI>Turbet,</HI> from <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> which for Country &s;ake, after they had taken out the principal Part of the La|ding, the Pyrate Crew &s;et her on Fire; the <HI>Endea|vour,</HI> Captain <HI>Scot,</HI> from <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and the <HI>Young,</HI> from <HI>Leith.</HI> From thence they went to <HI>New-York,</HI> and off the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> End of <HI>Long-I&s;land,</HI> took a Sloop bound for the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> after which they &s;tood in with the Sloop, and landed at <HI>Gardner</HI>'s <HI>I&s;land,</HI> but in a peaceable Manner, and bought Provi&s;ions for the Campany's U&s;e, which they paid for, and &s;o went off again without Mole&s;tation.</P>
<P>Some Time after, which was in <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1717, <HI>Bon|net</HI> and his Crew, came off the Bar of <HI>South-Car|rolina,</HI> and took a Sloop, and a Brigantine bound in; the Sloop belonged to <HI>Barbadoes, Jo&s;eph Palmer</HI> Ma&s;ter, laden with Rum, Sugar, and Negroes; and the Brigantine came from <HI>New-England, Thomas Porter</HI> Ma&s;ter, whom they plundered, and then di&s;mi&s;s'd; but they &s;ailed away with the Sloop, and at an Inlet in <HI>North-Carolina</HI> careen'd by her, and then &s;et her on Fire.</P>
<P>After the Sloop had cleaned, they put to Sea, but came to no Re&s;olution what Cour&s;e to take; the Crew were divided in their Opinions, &s;ome be|ing for one Thing, and &s;ome another, &s;o that no|thing
<PB N="62" REF="67">
but Confu&s;ion &s;eem'd to attend all their Schemes. The Captain found his Authority too weak to bring them to Order, nor could he prevail in any &s;ingle In&s;tance, for tho' the Sloop was all his own, they began to &s;hew a Di&s;repect, even to a Con|tempt of all he &s;aid or did. The Major was no Sailor, as was &s;aid before, and therefore had been obliged to yield to many Things that were impo|po&s;ed on him, during their Undertaking, for want of a competent Knowledge in maritime Affairs; till at length they thought fit to turn him out of the Command, which, by the by, was committing a &s;ort of Pyracy upon him, and &s;o for this Time the civil Di&s;&s;ention was put an End to, by ap|pointing one <HI>Edward Thatch</HI> Commander, (who for his remarkable black ugly Beard, was more common|ly called <HI>Black-Beard:)</HI> This Fellow was a good Sai|lor, but a mo&s;t cruel hardned Villain, bold and da|ring to the la&s;t Degree, and would not &s;tick at the perpetrating the mo&s;t abominable Wickedne&s;s ima|ginable; and as he was made Chief of that exe|crable Gang, &s;o it might be &s;aid that his Po&s;t was not unduly filled, for <HI>Black-Beard</HI> was truly the Su|perior in Roguery, of all that Company, as will be found in it's proper Place.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Bonnet</HI> continued &s;till with them, but in no Office aboard, neither did he concern him&s;elf much with their Affairs, not being well plea&s;ed, one mu&s;t think, at the unkind U&s;age he had re|ceived, much le&s;s could he &s;ubmit to a mean Ra&s;|kal, which he had &s;hip'd as a Fore-Ma&s;t-Man at <HI>Barbadoes.</HI> The Major now &s;aw his Folly, but could not help him&s;elf, which made him Melan|choly; he reflected upon his pa&s;t Cour&s;e of Life, and was confounded with Shame, when he thought upon what he had done: His Behaviour was taken Notice of by the other Pyrates, who liked him
<PB N="63" REF="68">
never the better for it; and he often declared to &s;ome of them, that he would gladly leave off that Way of Living, being fully tired of it; but he &s;hould be a &s;hamed to &s;ee the Face of any <HI>Engli&s;h-man</HI> again; therefore if he could get to <HI>Spain,</HI> or <HI>Portugal,</HI> where he might be undi&s;covered, he would &s;pend the Remainder of his Days in either of tho&s;e Countries, otherwi&s;e he mu&s;t continue in the &s;ame Cour&s;e, as long as he lived.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t drop the Major a-while, and pur&s;ue the Pyracies of this Crew as under <HI>Thatch</HI>'s Command, who&s;e Name we &s;hall now mention in&s;tead of <HI>Bonnet</HI>'s; for indeed he had not only the chief Rule, but the greate&s;t Sway of any Pyrate Captain, yet known, over his Men; and was &s;o very In&s;olent, Barbarous, and Tyrannical, as gave a &s;hock to Na|ture; as will be &s;hewn, when I come to treat par|ticularly of the Hi&s;tory of his Actions, indepen|dantly of that of Major <HI>Bonnet</HI>'s.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Thatch</HI> was plea&s;ed to take a Cruize off the Leeward I&s;lands, in the Sloop he was Captain of, and pre&s;ently took a Sloop with Provi&s;ions, which came very &s;ea&s;onable to his Hands; in this Sloop they put on board 30 Men, having en|crea&s;ed their Company, by taking 'em out of every Ship they made Prize of; and one <HI>Richards</HI> having a Mind to be a Captain too, was appointed to Command her. So beating up to Windward &s;ome Days afterwards, they met with a &s;tout Ship, with upwards of 20 Guns, which they attack'd very boldly under their proper Colours, <HI>(viz.)</HI> a black Flag with a Death's Head in the Middle, and, after a &s;mall di&s;pute, carry'd her; &s;he was a <HI>French Guiney-Man,</HI> bound to <HI>Martineco.</HI> This Ship was &s;oon made fit for Pyrate Service, aboard of which <HI>Thatch</HI> mounted forty Guns, taking every Thing he thought Nece&s;&s;ary out of the Sloop <HI>Richards</HI> com|manded, and gave it the <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> to carry them
<PB N="64" REF="69">
to the afore&s;aid I&s;land, &s;o <HI>Thatch</HI> went into the great Ship, which was chri&s;tned, <HI>The Queen Ann's Revenge.</HI></P>
<P>Some Days after this Change, the latter End of <HI>December,</HI> as <HI>Thatch</HI> was crui&s;ing off the I&s;land, St. <HI>Vincent,</HI> they de&s;cry'd at Ma&s;t-Head a Sail, and gave Cha&s;e to it; they found her a large Ship, and expected &s;ome warm Work, but &s;he had the Misfor|tune, with little or no Re&s;i&s;tance, to fall a Prize into the Hands of the&s;e Robbers; who &s;et all the Men a&s;hore on the I&s;land afore&s;aid, plundered her of what they thought fit, and then &s;et Fire to her: This Ship was called the <HI>Great Allen, Chri&s;topher Tay|lor</HI> Commander.</P>
<P>In this Cruize, they took another Ship and a Sloop, which they plundered and let go, and after|wards fell in with the <HI>Scarborough</HI> of 30 Guns. The Man of War engaged <HI>The Queen Ann's Revenge</HI> for three or four Hours, but not being &s;trong enough to do any notable Service again&s;t the Pyrates, returned to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> the Place of her Station, and <HI>Thatch</HI> &s;teered for the Coa&s;t of the <HI>Spani&s;h-America,</HI> and cleaned.</P>
<P>Major <HI>Bonnet</HI> continued &s;till in the Ship but in no Command; and after cleaning they proceeded to the Bay of <HI>Honduras;</HI> at <HI>Turniff,</HI> ten Leagues &s;hort of the Bay, they came to an Anchor on the fourth of <HI>April,</HI> 1718, and took in fre&s;h Water; the next Morning they &s;aw a Sloop coming in, where|upon <HI>Richards</HI> &s;lip'd his Cable in the <HI>Revenge,</HI> and went to meet her, who &s;eeing his black Flag, im|mediately &s;truck, and was brought to an Anchor, under the Stern of <HI>the Queen Ann's Revenge;</HI> &s;he was called the <HI>Adventure, David Harriot</HI> Ma&s;ter, from <HI>Jamaica;</HI> they took the Ma&s;ter out, and &s;ent Pyrate Hands on Board the Prize, and put in one <HI>Hands</HI> to Command her.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="70">
On the ninth Ditto, the Ship and Sloops weigh'd, and came to <HI>Honduras</HI> Bay, where lay four Sloops, and a Ship, three of the Sloops belonged to <HI>Jona|than Bernard,</HI> of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and the other to Captain <HI>James;</HI> the Ship was of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> called the <HI>Prote&s;tant Cae&s;ar,</HI> Captain <HI>Wyar</HI> Commander. <HI>Thatch</HI> hoi&s;ted his black Colours, and fired a Gun, upon which Captain <HI>Wyar,</HI> and all his Men left their Ship, and got a&s;hore in their Boat: <HI>Thatch</HI>'s Quarter-Ma&s;ter, and eight of his Crew, took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Wyar</HI>'s Ship, and <HI>Richards</HI> &s;ecured all the Sloops, one of which they burnt out of &s;pight to the Owner; and the <HI>Prote&s;tant Cae&s;ar</HI> they al&s;o burnt, after they had Plunder'd her, becau&s;e &s;he belong|ed to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> where &s;ome Men had been hanged for Pyracy; and the three Sloops belonging to <HI>Bernard</HI> they let go.</P>
<P>From hence the Rovers &s;ail'd to <HI>Turkill,</HI> and then to the <HI>Grand Camania,</HI> an I&s;land belonging to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> lying about &s;ixty Leagues to the We&s;tward of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> where they took a &s;mall Turtler, and &s;o to the <HI>Havana,</HI> and from thence to the <HI>Bahama</HI> Wrecks, and from the <HI>Bahama</HI> Wrecks, they &s;ailed to <HI>Carolina,</HI> taking a Brigantine and two Sloops in their Way, where they lay off the Bar of <HI>Charles-Town</HI> for five or &s;ix Days. They took here a Ship as &s;he was coming out, bound for <HI>London,</HI> commanded by one <HI>Robert Clark,</HI> with &s;ome Pa&s;&s;engers on Board going for <HI>England;</HI> the next Day they took another Ve&s;&s;el coming out of <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> and al&s;o two Pinks coming into <HI>Charles-Town;</HI> likewi&s;e a Brigantine with 14 Negroes aboard; all which being done in the Face of the Town, &s;truck a great Terror to the whole Province of <HI>Carolina,</HI> having ju&s;t before been vi&s;ited by <HI>Vane,</HI> another notorious Pyrate; that they abandoned them&s;elves to Di&s;pair, being in no Condition to re&s;i&s;t their Force. There were eight Sail in the Harbour,
<PB N="66" REF="71">
ready for the Sea, but none dar'd to venture out, it being almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to e&s;cape their Hands. The inward bound Ve&s;&s;els were under the &s;ame un|happy Dilemma, &s;o that the Trade of this Place was totally interrupted: What made the&s;e Misfor|tunes heavier to them, was a long expen&s;ive War, the Colony had had with the Natives, which was but ju&s;t ended when the&s;e Robbers infe&s;ted them.</P>
<P><HI>Thatch,</HI> or (as they more commonly call'd him) <HI>Black-beard,</HI> detained all the Ships and Pri&s;oners, and, being in want of Medicines, re&s;olved to de|mand a Che&s;t from the Government of the Pro|vince; accordingly <HI>Richards,</HI> the Captain of the <HI>Re|venge</HI> Sloop, with two or three more Pyrates were &s;ent up along with Mr. <HI>Marks,</HI> one of the Pri&s;oners, whom they had taken in <HI>Clark</HI>'s Ship, and very in|&s;olently made their Demands, threatning, that if they did not &s;end immediately the Che&s;t of Medi|cines, and let the Pyrate's Amba&s;&s;adors return, without offering any Violence to their Per&s;ons, they would murder all their Pri&s;oners, and &s;end up their Heads to the Governor, and al&s;o &s;et the Ships they had taken on Fire.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t Mr. <HI>Marks</HI> was making Application to the Council, <HI>Richards</HI> and the re&s;t of the Pyrates, walk'd the Streets, publickly, in the Sight of all People; and tho' they were fired with the utmo&s;t Indignation again&s;t them, looking upon them as Robbers and Murtherers, and particularly the Authors of their Wrongs and Oppre&s;&s;ions, yet they dur&s;t not &s;o much as think of executing their Re|venge, for Fear of bringing more Calamities upon them&s;elves, and &s;o they were forced to let the Villains pa&s;s with Impunity. The Government were not long in deliberating upon the Me&s;&s;age, tho' 'twas the greate&s;t Affront that could have been put upon them; yet for the &s;aving &s;o many Mens Lives, (among them, Mr. <HI>Samuel Wragg,</HI> one of
<PB N="67" REF="72">
the Council;) they comply'd with the Nece&s;&s;ity, and &s;ent aboard a Che&s;t, valued at between 3 and 400 l. and the Pyrates went back &s;afe to their Ships.</P>
<P><HI>Blackbeard,</HI> as &s;oon as he had received the Medi|cines, and his Brother Rogues, let go the Ships and the Pri&s;oners; having fir&s;t taken out of them in Gold and Silver, about 1500 l. Sterling, be&s;ides Provi&s;ions and other Matters.</P>
<P>From the Bar of <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> they &s;ail'd to <HI>North-Carolina;</HI> Captain <HI>Thatch,</HI> in the Ship, which they call'd the Man of War, Captain <HI>Richards</HI> and Cap|tain <HI>Hands</HI> in the Sloops, which they termed Pri|vateers, and another Sloop &s;erving them as a Tender. <HI>Thatch</HI> began now to think of breaking up the Company, and &s;ecuring the Money, and the be&s;t of the Effects for him&s;elf, and &s;ome other of his Companions he had mo&s;t Affection for, and to cheat the re&s;t: Accordingly, on Pretence of run|ning into <HI>Top&s;ail</HI> Inlet to clean, he grounded his Ship, and then, as if it had been done unde|fignedly, and by Accident; he Orders <HI>Hands</HI>'s Sloop to come to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and get him off again, which he endeavouring to do, ran the Sloop on Shore near the other, and &s;o were both lo&s;t. This done, <HI>Thatch</HI> goes into the Tender Sloop, with forty Hands, and leaves the <HI>Revenge</HI> there, which <HI>Bonnet</HI> rea&s;&s;umed the Command of, and goes away to <HI>Bath-Town</HI> in <HI>North-Carolina,</HI> &s;urren|ders to the King's Pardon, and receives a Certifi|cate. The War was now broke out between the <HI>Tripple</HI> Allies and <HI>Spain;</HI> &s;o Major <HI>Bonnet,</HI> gets a Clearance for his Sloop at <HI>North-Carolina,</HI> to go to the I&s;land of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> with a De&s;ign (at lea&s;t it was pretended &s;o) to get the Emperor's Commi&s;&s;ion, to go a Privateering upon the <HI>Spa|ards.</HI> When <HI>Bonnet</HI> came back to <HI>Top&s;ail</HI> Inlet, he found that <HI>Thatch</HI> and his Gang were gone, and that they
<PB N="68" REF="73">
had taken all the Money, &s;mall Arms, and Effects of Value out of the great Ship, and &s;et a&s;hore on a &s;mall Sandy I&s;land above a League from the Main, 17 Men, no doubt with a De&s;ign they &s;hould peri&s;h, there being no Inhabitant, or Provi&s;ions to &s;ub&s;i&s;t withal, nor any Boat or Mate|rials, to build, or make any kind of Launch or Ve&s;&s;el, to E&s;cape from that de&s;olate Place: They remained there two Nights, and one Day, without Sub&s;i&s;tance, or the lea&s;t Pro&s;pect of any, expecting nothing el&s;e but a lingering Death; when to their inexpre&s;&s;ible Comfort, they &s;aw Redemption at Hand, for Major <HI>Bonnet</HI> happening to get Intelli|gence of their being there, by two of the Py|rates who had e&s;cap'd <HI>Thatch</HI>'s Cruelty and had got to a poor little Village at the upper End of the Harbour, &s;ent his Boat to make Di&s;covery of the Truth of the Matter, which the poor Wretches &s;eeing, made a &s;ignal to them, and &s;o they were all brought on Board <HI>Bonnet</HI>'s Sloop.</P>
<P>Major <HI>Bonnet</HI> told all his Company, that he would take a Commi&s;&s;ion to go again&s;t the <HI>Spani|ards,</HI> and to that End, was going to St. <HI>Thomas</HI>'s, therefore if they would go with him, they &s;hould be welcome; whereupon they all con&s;ented, but as the Sloop was preparing to Sail, a Bom-Boat, that brought Apples and Sider to &s;ell to the Sloop's Men, inform'd them, that Captain <HI>Thatch</HI> lay at <HI>O$|ricock</HI> Inlet, with only 18 or 20 Hands. <HI>Bonnet,</HI> who bore him a mortal Hatred for all the In&s;ults he &s;uffered from him, went immediately in pur&s;uit of him, but it happened too late, for he mi&s;&s;ed of him there, and after four Days Cruize, hearing no farther News of him, they &s;teer'd their Cour&s;e to|wards <HI>Virginia.</HI></P>
<P>In the Month of <HI>July,</HI> the&s;e Adventurers came off the Capes, and meeting with a Pink with a Stock of Provi&s;ions on Board, which they happened to
<PB N="69" REF="74">
be in Want of, they took out of her ten or twelve Barrels of Pork, and about 400 Weight of Bread; but becau&s;e they would not have this &s;et down to the Account of Pyracy, they gave them eight or ten Casks of Rice, and an old Cable in lieu thereof.</P>
<P>Two Days afterwards, they cha&s;ed a Sloop of &s;ixty Tun, and took her two Leagues off of Cape <HI>Henry;</HI> they were &s;o Happy here, as to get a Supply of Liquor to their Victuals, for they brought from her two Hog&s;heads of Rum, and as many of Mo|lo&s;&s;es, which it &s;eems they had need of, tho' they had not ready Money to purcha&s;e them: What Se|curity they intended to give, I can't tell, but <HI>Bonnet</HI> &s;ent eight Men to take Care of the Prize Sloop, who perhaps, not liking to make U&s;e of tho&s;e ac|cu&s;tom'd Freedoms, took the fir&s;t Opportunity to go off with her, and <HI>Bonnet,</HI> (who was plea&s;ed to have him&s;elf called Captain <HI>Thomas,)</HI> &s;aw them no more.</P>
<P>After this, the Major threw off all Re&s;traint, and tho' he had ju&s;t before received his Maje&s;ty's Mercy, in the Name of <HI>Stede Bonnet,</HI> he relaps'd in good Earne&s;t into his old Vocation, by the Name of Captain <HI>Thomas,</HI> and recommenced a down right Pyrate, by taking and plundering all the Ve&s;&s;els he met with: He al&s;o took off Cape <HI>Henry,</HI> two Ships from <HI>Virginia</HI> bound to <HI>Gla&s;cow,</HI> out of which they took very little be&s;ides 100 Weight of Tobacco, and let them proceed on their Voyage. The next Day they took a &s;mall Sloop bound from <HI>Virginia,</HI> to <HI>Bermudas,</HI> and took away from her 20 Barrels of Pork, &s;ome Bacon, and gave him again two Bar|rels of Rice, and a Hog&s;head of Molo&s;&s;us; out of this Sloop two Men enter'd Voluntarily. The next they took was another <HI>Virginia</HI> Man, bound to <HI>Gla&s;|cow,</HI> out of which they had nothing of Value, &s;ave only a few Combs, Pins, and Needles, and
<PB N="70" REF="75">
gave her in&s;tead thereof, a Barrel of Pork, and two Barrels of Bread.</P>
<P>From <HI>Virginia,</HI> they &s;ailed to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and in the Latitude of 38 North, they took a Scooner, coming from <HI>North-Carolina,</HI> bound to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> they had out of her only two Dozen of Calf-Skins, to make Covers for Guns, and two of their Hands, and detain'd her &s;ome Days. All this was but &s;mall Game, and &s;eem'd as if they de&s;ign'd only to make Provi&s;ion for their Sloop again&s;t they arrived at St. <HI>Thomas</HI>'s; for they hitherto had dealt fa|vourably with all that were &s;o unhappy as to fall into their Hands; but tho&s;e that came after, far'd not &s;o well, for in the Latitude of 39, off of <HI>De|laware</HI> River, near <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> they took two Snows bound to <HI>Bri&s;tel,</HI> out to whom they got &s;ome Mo|ney, be&s;ides Goods, perhaps to the Value of 150 Pounds; at the &s;ame Time they took a Sloop of &s;ixty Tuns bound from <HI>Philadelphia</HI> to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> which, after taking &s;ome goods out of her, they di&s;|mi&s;s'd along with the Snows.</P>
<P>The 29th Day of <HI>July,</HI> Captain <HI>Thomas</HI> took a Sloop of 50 Tuns, &s;ix or &s;even Leagues off <HI>Dela|ware</HI> Bay, bound from <HI>Philadelphia</HI> to <HI>Barbadoes, Tho|mas Read</HI> Ma&s;ter, loaden with Provi&s;ions, which they kept, and put four or five of their Hands on Board her. The la&s;t Day of <HI>July,</HI> they took ano|ther Sloop of 60 Tuns, commanded by <HI>Peter Man|waring,</HI> bound from <HI>Antegoa,</HI> to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> which they likewi&s;e kept with all the Cargo, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of Rum, Molo&s;&s;es, Sugar, Cotton, Indigo, and about 25 Pound in Money, valued in all to 500 Pound.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Day of <HI>July,</HI> our Rovers with the Ve&s;&s;els la&s;t taken, left <HI>Delaware</HI> Bay, and &s;ail'd to Cape <HI>Fear</HI> River, where they &s;taid too long for their Safety, for the Pyrate Sloop which they now new nam'd the <HI>Royal James,</HI> proved very leaky, &s;o that
<PB N="71" REF="76">
they were obliged to remain here almo&s;t two Months, to refit and repair their Ve&s;&s;el: They took in this River a &s;mall Shallop, which they rip|ped up to mend the Sloop, and retarded the fur|ther Pro&s;ecution of their Voyage, as before menti|on'd, till the News came to <HI>Carolina,</HI> of a Pyrate Sloop's being there to Carreen with her Prizes.</P>
<P>Upon this Information, the Council of <HI>South-Caro|lina</HI> was alarmed, and apprehended they &s;hould receive another Vi&s;it from them &s;peedily; to pre|vent which Colonel <HI>William Rhet,</HI> of the &s;ame Pro|vince, waited on the Governor, and generou&s;ly of|fered him&s;elf to go with two Sloops to Attack this Pyrate; which the Governor readily accepted of, and accordingly gave the Colonel a Commi&s;|&s;ion, and full Power, to fit Ve&s;&s;els as he thought proper for the De&s;ign.</P>
<P>In a few Days two Sloops were equipp'd and mann'd: The <HI>Henry</HI> with 8 Guns, and 70 Men, com|manded by Captain <HI>John Ma&s;ters,</HI> and the <HI>Sea Nymph,</HI> with eight Guns, and 60 Men, commanded by Captain <HI>Fayrer Hall,</HI> both under the entire Di|rection and Command of the afore&s;aid Colonel <HI>Rhet,</HI> who, on the 14th of <HI>September,</HI> went on Board the <HI>Henry,</HI> and, with the other Sloop, &s;ail'd from <HI>Charles-Town</HI> to <HI>Swillivant</HI>'s I&s;land, to put them|&s;elves in order for the Cruize. Ju&s;t then arri|ved a &s;mall Ship from <HI>Antigoa,</HI> one <HI>Cock,</HI> Ma&s;ter, with an Account, that in Sight of the Bar, he was taken and Plundered, by one <HI>Charles Vane,</HI> a Pyrate, in a Brigantine of 12 Guns and 90 Men; and who had al&s;o taken two other Ve&s;&s;els bound in there, one a &s;mall Sloop, Captain <HI>Dill</HI> Ma&s;ter, from <HI>Barbadoes;</HI> the other a Brigantine, Captain <HI>Thomp|&s;on</HI> Ma&s;ter, from <HI>Guinea,</HI> with ninety odd Negroes, which they took out of the Ve&s;&s;el, and put on Board another Sloop then under the Command of one <HI>Yeats</HI> his Con&s;ort, with 15 Men. This prov'd
<PB N="72" REF="77">
fortunate to the Owners of the <HI>Guiney-Man,</HI> for <HI>Years</HI> having often attempted to quiet this Cour&s;e of Life, took an Opportunity in the Night, to leave <HI>Vane,</HI> and to run into <HI>North-Edi&s;to</HI> River, to the Southward of <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> and &s;urrendered to his Maje&s;ty's Pardon. The Owners got their Ne|groes, and <HI>Yeats</HI> and his Men had Certificates given them from the Government.</P>
<P><HI>Vane</HI> crui&s;ed &s;ome Time off the Bar, in hopes to catch <HI>Yeats,</HI> and unfortunately for them, took two Ships coming out, bound to <HI>London,</HI> and while the Pri&s;oners were aboard, &s;ome of the Pyrates gave out, that they de&s;igned to go into one of the Rivers, to the Southward. Colonel <HI>Rhet,</HI> upon hearing this, &s;ail'd over the Bar the 15th of <HI>Sep|tember,</HI> with the two Sloops before mentioned; and having the Wind Northerly, went after the Py|rate <HI>Vane,</HI> and &s;coured the Rivers and Inlets to the Southward; but not meeting with him, tack'd, and &s;tood for Cape <HI>Fear</HI> River, in Pro&s;ecution of his fir&s;t De&s;ign. On the 26th following, in the Evening, the Colonel with his &s;mall Squadron, entered the River, and &s;aw, over a Point of Land, three Sloops at Anchor, which were Major <HI>Bonnet</HI> and his Prizes; but it happened that in going up the River, the Pilot run both the Sloops a ground, and it was dark before they were on Float, which hinder'd their getting up that Night. The Pyrates &s;oon di&s;covered the Sloops, but not knowing who they were, or upon what De&s;ign they came into that River, they manned three Canoes, and &s;ent them down to take them, but they quickly found their Mi&s;take, and return'd to the Sloop, with the unwelcome News. Major <HI>Bonnet</HI> made Preparations that Night for engaging, and took all the Men out of the Prizes. He &s;hewed Captain <HI>Manwaring,</HI> one of his Pri&s;oners, a Letter, he had ju&s;t wrote, which he declared he would &s;end to the Governor
<PB N="73" REF="78">
of <HI>Carolina;</HI> the Letter was to this effect, <HI>viz. That if the Sloops, which then appeared, were &s;ent out again&s;t him, by the &s;aid Governor, and he &s;hould get clear off; that he would burn and de&s;troy all Ships or Ve&s;&s;els, going in, or coming out, of</HI> South-Carolina. The next Morn|ing they got under Sail, and came down the River, de&s;igning only a running Fight. Colonel <HI>Rhet</HI>'s Sloops got likewi&s;e under Sail, and &s;tood for him, getting upon each Quarter of the Pyrate, with In|tent to board him; which he perceiving, edg'd in towards the Shore, and being warmly engaged, their Sloop ran a-ground: The <HI>Carolina</HI> Sloops being in the &s;ame &s;hoal Water, were in the &s;ame Circum&s;tances; the <HI>Henry</HI> in which Colonel <HI>Rhet</HI> was, grounded within Pi&s;tol &s;hot of the Pyrate, and on his Bow; the other Sloop grounded right a-head of him, and almo&s;t out of Gun-Shot, which made her of little Service to the Colonel, while they lay aground.</P>
<P>At this Time the Pyrate had a con&s;iderable Ad|vantage; for their Sloop, after &s;he was a-ground, li&s;t|ed from Colonel <HI>Rhet</HI>'s, by which Means they were all cover'd, and the Colonel's Sloop li&s;ting the &s;ame Way, his Men were much expo&s;ed; not|with&s;tanding which, they kept a brisk Fire the whole Time they lay thus aground, which was near five Hours. The Pyrates made a Wiff in their bloody Flag, and beckon'd &s;everal Times with their Hats, in Deri&s;ion to the Colonel's Men, to come on board, which they an&s;wered with chearful Huz|za's, and &s;aid, <HI>that they would &s;peak with them, by and by;</HI> which accordingly happened, for the Colonel's Sloop being fir&s;t a-Float, he got into deeper Water, and after mending the Sloop's Rigging, which was much &s;hatter'd in the Engagement, they &s;tood for the Pyrate, to give the fini&s;hing Stroke, and de&s;igned to go directly on Board him; which he prevented, by &s;ending a Flag of Truce,

and after &s;ome Time capitulating, they &s;urrendred them&s;elves Pri&s;oners.

<P>There were kill'd in this Action, on Board the <HI>Henry,</HI> ten Men, and fourteen wounded; on Board the <HI>Sea Nymph,</HI> two killed, and four wounded. The Officers and Sailors in both Sloops, behaved them|&s;elves with the greate&s;t Bravery; and had not the Sloops &s;o unluckily run a-ground, they had taken the Pyrate with much le&s;s lo&s;s of Men; but as he de&s;ign'd to get by them, and &s;o make a run|ning Fight, the <HI>Carolina</HI> Sloops were obliged to to keep near him, to prevent his getting away. Of the Pyrates there were &s;even kill'd, and five wounded, two of which died &s;oon after of their Wounds.

<P><HI>Bonnet,</HI> and his Crew, two Days after, were put a|&s;hore, and there not being a publick Pri&s;on, the Pyrates were kept at the Watch-Hou&s;e, under a Guard of Militia; but Major <HI>Bonnet</HI> was com|mitted into the Cu&s;tody of the Mar&s;hal, at his Hou&s;e; and in a few Days after, <HI>David Hariot</HI> the Ma&s;ter, and <HI>Ignatius Pell,</HI> the Boat&s;wain, who were de&s;ign'd for Evidences again&s;t the other Pyrates, were removed from the re&s;t of the Crew, to the &s;aid Mar&s;hal's Hou&s;e, and every Night two Cen|tine$s &s;et about the &s;aid Hou&s;e; but whether thro' any Corruption, or want of Care in guarding the Pri&s;oners, I can't &s;ay; but on the 24th of <HI>October,</HI> the Major and <HI>Harist</HI> made their e&s;cape, the Boat|&s;wain refu&s;ing to go along with them.

a great Noi&s;e in the Province, and People were open in their Re&s;entments, often reflecting on the Governor, and others in the Magi&s;tracy, as tho' they had been brib'd, for conniving at their E&s;cape.

<P><HI>Bonnet</HI> &s;tood to the Northward, in a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el, but wanting Nece&s;&s;aries, and the Weather being bad, he was forced back, and &s;o return'd with his Ca|noe, to <HI>Swillivants</HI> I&s;land, near <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> to fetch Supplies; but there being &s;ome Information &s;ent to the Governor, he &s;ent for Colonel <HI>Rhet,</HI> and de&s;ired him to go in pur&s;uit of <HI>Bonnet;</HI> and ac|cordingly gave him a Commi&s;&s;ion for that Pur|po&s;e: Wherefore the Colonel, with proper Craft, and &s;ome Men went away that Night for <HI>Swil|livant</HI>'s I&s;land, and after a very diligent Search di&s;covered <HI>Bonnet</HI> and <HI>Hariot</HI> together; the Colonel's Men fired upon them, and killed <HI>Hariot</HI> upon the Spot, and wounded one <HI>Negro,</HI> and an <HI>Indian.

<P>This was the Form of the Indictments, they were arraigned upon, and tho' they might have prov'd &s;everal more Facts upon the major Part of the Crew, the Court thought fit to pro&s;ecute but two; the other was for &s;eizing in a Pyratical and felo|nious Manner, the Sloop <HI>Fortune, Thomas Read</HI> Commander; which Indictment running in the &s;ame Form with the above mentioned, it will be unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay more of it.</P>

<P>MAjor <HI>Stede Bonnet,</HI> you &s;tand here convicted upon two Indictments of Pyracy; one by the Verdict of the Jury, and the other by your own Confe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Altho' you were indicted but for <HI>two</HI> Facts, yet you know that at your Tryal it was fully proved, even by an unwilling Witne&s;s, that you <HI>pyratically</HI> took and rifled no le&s;s than <HI>thirteen</HI> Ve&s;&s;els, &s;ince you &s;ailed from <HI>North-Carolina.</HI></P>
<P>So that you might have been indicted, and con|victed of <HI>eleven</HI> more Acts of <HI>Pyracy,</HI> &s;ince you took the Benefit of the King's <HI>Act of Grace,</HI> and pre|tended to leave that wicked Cour&s;e of Life.</P>
<P>Not to mention the many <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Pyracy</HI> you committed before; for which if your Pardon from <HI>Man</HI> was never &s;o authentick, yet you mu&s;t expect to an&s;wer for them before God.</P>
<P>You know that the Crimes you have committed are <HI>evil</HI> in them&s;elves, and contrary to the <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> as well as the <HI>Law</HI> of God, by which you are commanded that <HI>you &s;hall not &s;teal,</HI> Exod. 20. 15.

<P>But to <HI>Theft</HI> you have added a greater Sin, which is <HI>Murder.</HI> How many you may have <HI>killed</HI> of tho&s;e that re&s;i&s;ted you in the committing your former <HI>Pyracies,</HI> I know not: But this we all know, That be&s;ides the Wounded, you killed no le&s;s than <HI>eighteen</HI> Per&s;ons out of tho&s;e that were &s;ent by lawful Au|thority
<PB N="82" REF="87">
to &s;uppre&s;s you, and to put a &s;top to tho&s;e Rapines that you daily acted.</P>
<P>And however you may fancy that that was killing Men fairly in open <HI>Fight,</HI> yet this know, That the Power of the <HI>Sword</HI> not being committed into your Hands by any lawful Authority, you were not im|powered to u&s;e any <HI>Force,</HI> or to <HI>fight</HI> any one; and therefore tho&s;e Per&s;ons that fell in that Action, in doing their Duty to their King and Country, were <HI>murdered,</HI> and their <HI>Blood</HI> now cries out for <HI>Ven|geance</HI> and <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> again&s;t you: For it is the <HI>Voice of Nature,</HI> confirmed by the <HI>Law</HI> of God, That <HI>Who&s;o &s;heddeth Man's Blood, by Man &s;hall his Blood be &s;hed,</HI> Gen. 9. 6.</P>
<P>And con&s;ider that Death is not the only Puni&s;h|ment due to <HI>Murderers;</HI> for they are threatned to have <HI>their Part in the Lake which burneth with Fire and Brim&s;tone, which is the &s;econd Death,</HI> Rev. 21. 8.

<P>As the <HI>Te&s;timony</HI> of your <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> mu&s;t convince you of the great and many Evils you have com|mitted, by which you have highly offended God, and provoked mo&s;t ju&s;tly his Wrath and Indigna|tion again&s;t you, &s;o I &s;uppo&s;e I need not tell you that the only Way of obtaining Pardon and Remi&s;|&s;ion of your Sins from God, is by a true and un|feigned <HI>Repentance,</HI> and <HI>Faith</HI> in Chri&s;t, by who&s;e meritorious Death and Pa&s;&s;ion, you can only hope for Salvation.</P>
<P>You being a Gentleman that have had the Ad|vantage or a <HI>liberal Education,</HI> and being generally e&s;teemed a Man of <HI>Letters,</HI> I believe it will be need|le&s;s for me to explain to you the Nature of <HI>Repen|tance</HI>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. OF Captain <HI>THATCH,</HI> alias BLACK BEARD.</HEAD>
<P><HI>EEward Thatch,</HI> (commonly called <HI>Black-beard,)</HI> was born in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and was from a Boy bred up to the Sea; in the late War he &s;ail'd for the mo&s;t Part in Privateers, yet, tho' he had often di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf for his uncommon Boldne&s;s, and per&s;onal Courage, he was never rai&s;ed to any Command. The fir&s;t of his going upon the pyrating Account, was with Major <HI>Bon|net,</HI> a Gentleman of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> worth 500 l. a Year, real E&s;tate, who being, as 'tis &s;uppo&s;ed, a little di&s;tracted, fitted out a Sloop from that I&s;land, to become a Pyrate, as has been taken Notice of in his Life. With him <HI>Thatch</HI> &s;hip'd him&s;elf as a Fore|ma&s;t Man; The Pyrates &s;oon found Major <HI>Bonnet,</HI>
<PB REF="92" MS="Y">

</FIGURE>
<PB N="87" REF="93">
to be a Per&s;on unfit for this Condition of Life; and tho' the Sloop was his own, yet they depo&s;ed him from the Command, and by common Con&s;ent, placed this <HI>Thatch</HI> in his Room.</P>
<P>We have already given an Account of the Pyra|cies of <HI>Thatch,</HI> to the Time of his parting with Major <HI>Bonnet,</HI> which was, when he lo&s;t his Ship in <HI>Top&s;ail</HI> Inlet, in <HI>North-Carolina,</HI> where &s;ome of his Men were drowned, and others di&s;per&s;ed about the Country; after which, he, and twenty or thirty more of the Crew, went up to <HI>Bath-Town,</HI> and &s;urrendred to his Maje&s;ty's Mercy, as offered by Proclamation, and they all received Certificates from his Excellency <HI>Charles Eden</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Governor of that Province. It did not appear that their &s;ubmitting to this Proclamation, was from any Re|formation of Manners, but only to wait a more favourable Opportunity to play the &s;ame Game over again; which he &s;oon after effected, with greater Security to him&s;elf, and with much bet|ter Pro&s;pect of Succe&s;s, having in this Time culti|vated a very good Under&s;tanding with the Gover|nor above mentioned.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Piece of Service this kind Governor did to <HI>Black-beard,</HI> was, to give him a Right to the Ve&s;&s;el which he had taken, when he was a pyrating in the great Ship, call'd the <HI>Queen Ann's Revenge,</HI> for which purpo&s;e, a Court of Vice-Admi|ralty was held at <HI>Bath-Town;</HI> and, tho' <HI>Thatch</HI> had never any Commi&s;&s;ion in his Life, and the Sloop belonging to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants, and taken in Time of Peace; yet was &s;he condemned as a Prize taken from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> by the &s;aid <HI>Thatch.</HI> The&s;e Proceedings &s;hew that Governors are but Men.</P>
<P>Before he &s;ail'd upon his Adventures, he mar|ry'd a young Creature, of about &s;ixteen Years of Age, the Governor performing the Ceremony. As it is a Cu&s;tom to marry here by a Prie&s;t, &s;o it is
<PB N="88" REF="94">
there by a Magi&s;trate; and this, as I have been in|form'd, made <HI>Thatch</HI>'s fourteenth Wife, whereof, about a dozen might be &s;till living. His Beha|viour in this State, was &s;omething extraordinary; for, while his Sloop lay in <HI>Okerecock</HI> Inlet, and he a&s;hore at a Plantation, where his Wife lived, with whom, after he had lain all Night, it was his Cu&s;tom to invite five or &s;ix of his brutal Com|panions to come a&s;hore, and he would force her to pro&s;titute her &s;elf to them all, one after ano|ther, before his Face.</P>
<P>In <HI>June,</HI> 1718, he went to Sea, upon his &s;econd Expedition, and &s;teered his Cour&s;e towards <HI>Bermu|das;</HI> he met with two or three <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;els in his Way, but robbed them only of Provi&s;ions, Stores, and other Nece&s;&s;aries, for his Pre&s;ent Ex|pence; but, near the I&s;land aforementioned, he fell in with two <HI>French</HI> Ships, one of them was loaden with Sugar, and Cocoa, and the other light, both bound to <HI>Martinico;</HI> the Ship that had no Lading, he let go, and putting all the Men of the loaded Ship aboard her, <HI>Thatch</HI> brought home the other with her Cargoe, to <HI>North-Carolina,</HI> where the Governor and the Pyrates, &s;har'd the Plunder.</P>
<P>When <HI>Thatch</HI> and his Prize arrived, he and four of his Crew, went to his Excellency, and made Af|fidavit, that they found the <HI>French</HI> Ship at Sea, without a Soul on Board her; and then a Court was call'd, and the Ship condemned: The Governor had &s;ixty Hog&s;heads of Sugar for his Dividend, and one Mr. <HI>Knight,</HI> who was his Secretary, and Collector of the Province, twenty, and the re&s;t was &s;hared among the other Pyrates.</P>
<P>The Bu&s;ine&s;s was not yet done, the Ship re|main'd, and it was po&s;&s;ible, one or other might come into the River, that might be acquainted with her, and &s;o di&s;cover the Roguery; but <HI>Thatch,</HI> thought of a Contrivance to prevent this,
<PB N="89" REF="95">
for, upon a Pretence that &s;he was leaky, and that &s;he might &s;ink, and &s;o &s;top up the Mouth of the Inlet, or Cove, where &s;he lay, he obtained an Order from the Governor, to bring her out into the River, and &s;et her on Fire, which was ac|cordingly executed, and &s;he was burnt down to the Water's Edge, and her Bottom &s;unk, and with it, their Fears of her ever ri&s;ing in Judgment again&s;t them.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Thatch,</HI> alias <HI>Black-beard,</HI> pa&s;s'd three or four Months in the River, &s;ometimes lying at An|chor in the Coves, at other Times, &s;ailing from one Inlet to another, trading with &s;uch Sloops as he met, for all Things he wanted, whether Provi&s;ions, or Stores, and giving them &s;omething el&s;e in Ex|change,&mdash;that is, when he happened to be in a giving Humour; at other Times he made bold with them, and took what he liked, without &s;ay|ing, <HI>by your Leave,</HI> knowing well, they dare not &s;end him in a Bill for the Payment. He often di|verted him&s;elf with going a&s;hore among the Plan|ters, where he revell'd Night and Day: By the&s;e he was well received, but whether out of Love or Fear, I cannot &s;ay; &s;ometimes he u&s;ed them cour|teou&s;ly enough, and made them Pre&s;ents of Rum, and Sugar, in Recompence of what he took from them; but, as for Liberties, (which 'tis &s;aid,) he and his Companions often took with the Wives and Daughters of the Planters, I can not take upon me to &s;ay, whether he paid them <HI>ad Valorem,</HI> or no. At other Times he carried it in a lordly Manner towards them, and would lay &s;ome of them under Contribution; nay, he often proceeded to bully the Governor, not, that I can di&s;cover the lea&s;t Cau&s;e of Quarrel betwixt them, but it &s;eem'd only to be done, to &s;hew he dare do it.</P>
<P>The Sloops trading up and down this River, being &s;o frequently pillaged by <HI>Black-beard,</HI> con|&s;ulted
<PB N="90" REF="96">
with the Traders, and &s;ome of the be&s;t of the Planters, what Cour&s;e to take; they &s;aw plainly it would be in vain to make any Application to the Governor of <HI>North-Carolina,</HI> to whom it pro|perly belonged, to find &s;ome Redre&s;s; &s;o that if they could not be relieved from &s;ome other Quar|ter, <HI>Black-beard</HI> would be like to Reign with Impu|nity; therefore, with as much Secrecy as po&s;&s;ible, they &s;ent a Deputation to <HI>Virginia,</HI> to lay the Affair before the Governor of that Colony, and to &s;olicit an armed Force, from the Men of War lying there, to take this Pyrate.</P>
<P>This Governor con&s;ulted with the Captains of the two Men of War, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Pearl,</HI> and <HI>Lime,</HI> who had lain in St. <HI>James</HI>'s River, about ten Months. It was agreed, that the Governor &s;hould hire a couple of &s;mall Sloops, and the Men of War &s;hould Man them; this was accordingly done, and the Command of them given to Mr. <HI>Robert Maynard,</HI> fir&s;t Lieutenant of the <HI>Pearl,</HI> an expe|rienced Officer, and a Gentleman of great Bravery and Re&s;olution, as will appear by his gallant Be|haviour in this Expedition. The Sloops were well mann'd, and furni&s;h'd with Ammunition and &s;mall Arms, but had no Guns mounted.</P>
<P>About the Time of their going out, the Gover|nor call'd an A&s;&s;embly in which it was re&s;olved to publi&s;h a Proclamation, offering certain Rewards to any Per&s;on, or Per&s;ons, who within a Year after that Time, &s;hould take or de&s;troy any Pyrate: The original Proclamation being in our Hands, is as follows.</P>

<P><HI>A SPOTSWOOD.</HI></P>
<P>The 1$th of <HI>November,</HI> 1718, the Lieutenant &s;ail'd from <HI>Kicquetan,</HI> in <HI>James</HI> River in <HI>Virginia,</HI> and the 21&s;t in the Evening, came to the Mouth of <HI>Okerecock</HI> Inlet, where he got &s;ight of the Pyrate. This Expedition was made with all imaginable Secrecy, and the Officer manag'd with all the Pru|dence that was nece&s;&s;ary, &s;toping all Boats and Ve&s;&s;els he met with, in the River, from going up, and thereby preventing any Intelligence from reach|ing <HI>Black-beard,</HI> and receiving at the &s;ame an Ac|count from them all, of the Place where the Pyrate was lurking; but notwith&s;tanding this Caution,
<PB N="93" REF="99">
<HI>Black-beard</HI> had Information of the De&s;ign, from his Excellency of the Province; and his Secretary, Mr. <HI>Knight,</HI> wrote him a Letter, particularly con|cerning it, intimating, <HI>that he had &s;ent him four of his Men, which were all he could meet with, in or about Town, and &s;o bid him be upon his Guard.</HI> The&s;e Men belonged to <HI>Black-beard,</HI> and were &s;ent from <HI>Bath-Town,</HI> to <HI>Okerecock,</HI> where the Sloop lay, which is about 20 Leagues.</P>
<P><HI>Black-beard</HI> had heard &s;everal Reports, which happened not to be true, and &s;o gave the le&s;s Cre|dit to this, nor was he convinced till he &s;aw the Sloops: Thereupon he put his Ve&s;&s;el in a Po&s;ture of Defence; he had no more than Twenty five Men on Board, tho' he gave out to all the Ve&s;&s;els he &s;poke with, that he had 40. When he had pre|pared for Battle, he &s;et down and &s;pent the Night in drinking with the Ma&s;ter of a trading Sloop, who, 'twas thought, had more Bu&s;ine&s;s with <HI>Thatch,</HI> than he &s;hould have had.</P>
<P>Lieutenant <HI>Maynard</HI> came to an Anchor, for the Place being &s;hoal, and the Channel intricate, &s;o that there was no getting in, where <HI>Thatch</HI> lay, that Night; but in the Morning he weigh'd, and &s;ent his Boat a Head of the Sloops, to &s;ound, and coming within Gun-Shot of the Pyrate, re|ceived his Fire; whereupon <HI>Maynard</HI> hoi&s;ted the King's Colours, and &s;tood directly towards him, with the be&s;t Way that his Sails and Oars could make. <HI>Black-beard</HI> cut his Cable, and endeavoured to make a running Fight, keeping a continual Fire at his Enemies, with his Guns, Mr. <HI>Maynard</HI> not ha|ving any, kept a con&s;tant Fire with &s;mall Arms, while &s;ome of his Men laboured at their Oars; <HI>Black-beard</HI>'s Sloop ran aground, and Mr. <HI>Mayn|ard</HI>'s drawing more Water than that of the Pyrate, he could not come near him, &s;o he anchored within half Gun-Shot of the Enemy; and, in order to
<PB N="94" REF="100">
lighten his Ve&s;&s;el, that he might run him aboard; the Lieutenant ordered all his Balla&s;t to be thrown over-Board, and all the Water to be &s;taved, and then weigh'd and &s;tood for him; upon which <HI>Black-beard,</HI> hail'd him in this rude Manner: <HI>Damn you for Villains, who are you? And, from whence came you?</HI> The Lieutenant made him An&s;wer, <HI>You may &s;ee by our Colours, we are no Pyrates. Black-beard</HI> bid him &s;end his Boat on Board, that he might &s;ee who he was; but Mr. <HI>Maynard</HI> reply'd thus; <HI>I cannot &s;pare my Boat, but I will come aboard of you, as &s;oon as I can, with my Sloop.</HI> Upon this, <HI>Black-beard</HI> took a Gla&s;s of Liquor, and drank to him with the&s;e Words: <HI>Damnation &s;eize my Soul if I give you Quarters, or take any from you.</HI> In An&s;wer to which, Mr. <HI>Maynard</HI> told him, that <HI>he expected no Quarters from him, nor &s;hould he give him any.</HI></P>
<P>By this Time <HI>Black-beard</HI>'s Sloop fleeted, as Mr. <HI>Maynard</HI>'s Sloops were rowing towards him, which being not above a Foot high in the Wa&s;t, and con|&s;equently the Men all expo&s;ed, as they came near together, (there being hitherto, little or no Exe|cution done, on either Side,) the Pyrate fired a Broad&s;ide, charged with all manner of &s;mall Shot,&mdash;A fatal Stroke to them! The Sloop the Lieutenant was in, having twenty Men kill'd and wounded, and the other Sloop nine: This could not be help'd, for their being no Wind, they were oblig'd to keep to their Oars, otherwi&s;e, the Pyrate would have got away from him, which, it &s;eems, the Lieutenant was re&s;olute to pre|vent.</P>
<P>After this unlucky Blow, <HI>Black-beard</HI>'s Sloop fell Broad&s;ide to the Shore; Mr. <HI>Maynard</HI>'s other Sloop, which was call'd the <HI>Ranger,</HI> fell a-&s;tern, being for the pre&s;ent di&s;abled, &s;o the Lieutenant finding his own Sloop had Way, and would &s;oon be on Board of <HI>Thatch,</HI> he ordered all his Men
<PB N="95" REF="101">
down, for fear of another Broad&s;ide, which mu&s;t have been their De&s;truction, and the lo&s;s of their Expedition. Mr. <HI>Maynard</HI> was the only Per&s;on that kept the Deck, except the Man at the Helm, whom he directed to lye down &s;nug, and the Men in the Hold were ordered to get their Pi&s;tols and their Swords ready for clo&s;e fighting, and to come up at his Command; in order to which, two Ladders were placed in the Hatch-Way for the more Expedition. When the Lieutenant's Sloop boarded the other, Captain <HI>Thatch's</HI> Men threw in &s;everal new fa&s;hion'd &s;ort of Grenadoes, <HI>viz.</HI> Ca&s;e-Bottles filled with Powder, and &s;mall Shot, Slugs, and Pieces of Lead or Iron, with a quick Match in the Mouth of it, which being lighted without &s;ide, pre&s;ently runs into the Bot|tle to the Powder, and as it is in&s;tantly thrown on Board, generally does great Execution, be&s;ides putting all the Crew into a Confu&s;ion; but by good Providence, they had not that Effect here; the Men being in the Hold, and <HI>Black-beard</HI> &s;eeing few or no Hands aboard, told his Men, that <HI>they were all knock'd on the Head, except three or four, and therefore,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>let's jump on Board and cut them to Pieces.</HI></P>
<P>Whereupon, under the Smoak of one of the Bottles ju&s;t mentioned, <HI>Black-beard</HI> enters with fourteen Men, over the Bows of <HI>Maynard</HI>'s Sloop, and were not &s;een by him, till the Air clear'd; however, he ju&s;t then gave a Signal to his Men, who all ro&s;e in an In&s;tant, and attack'd the Pyrates with as much Bravery as ever was done upon &s;uch an Occa&s;ion: <HI>Black-beard</HI> and the Lieutenant fired the fir&s;t Pi&s;tol at each other, by which the Pyrate received a Wound, and then engaged with Swords, till the Lieutenant's unluckily broke, and &s;teping back to cock a Pi&s;tol, <HI>Black-beard,</HI> with his Cut|la&s;h, was &s;triking at that In&s;tant, that one of <HI>May|nard</HI>'s
<PB N="96" REF="102">
Men gave him a terrible Wound in the Neck and Throat, by which the Lieutenant came off with a &s;mall Cut over his Fingers.</P>
<P>They were now clo&s;ely and warmly engaged, the Lieutenant and twelve Men, again&s;t <HI>Black-beard</HI> and fourteen, till the Blood run out of the Scuppers in Streams; <HI>Black-beard</HI> received a Shot into his Body, from the Pi&s;tol that Lieutenant <HI>Maynard</HI> cock'd, yet &s;till &s;tood his Ground and fought with great Fury, till he received &s;ixteen Wounds, and five of them by Shot. At length, as he was cocking another Pi&s;tol, having fir'd &s;e|veral before, he fell down dead; by which Time, eight more out of the fourteen dropt, and all the re&s;t much wounded, jump'd over-board, and call'd out for Quarters; which was granted, tho' it was only prolonging their Lives for a few Days. The Sloop <HI>Ranger</HI> came up, and attack'd the Men that remain'd in <HI>Black-beard</HI>'s Sloop with equal Bra|very, till they likewi&s;e cry'd for Quarters.</P>
<P>Here was an End of that couragious Brute, who might have pa&s;s'd in the World for a Heroe, had he been employ'd in a good Cau&s;e; his De&s;truction which was of &s;uch Con&s;equence to the Plantations, was entirely owing to the Conduct and Bravery of Lieutenant <HI>Maynard,</HI> and his Men, who might have de&s;troyed him with much le&s;s lo&s;s, had they had a Ve&s;&s;el with great Guns; but they were obliged to u&s;e &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, becau&s;e the Holes and Places he lurk'd in, would not admit of others, of greater Draught; for it was no &s;mall Difficulty for this Gentleman to get to him, having ground|ed his Ve&s;&s;el at lea&s;t a hundred Times in getting up the River, be&s;ides other Di&s;couragements, enough to have turn'd back any Gentleman with|out Di&s;honour, who was le&s;s re&s;olute and bold than this Lieutenant. The Broad&s;ide that did &s;o much Mi&s;chief before they boarded, in all probability, &s;a|ved
<PB N="97" REF="103">
the re&s;t from De&s;truction; for before that, <HI>Thatch</HI> had little or no Hopes of e&s;caping, and therefore had po&s;ted a re&s;olute Fellow a Negroe, whom he had bred up, with a lighted Match, in the Powder-Room, with Commands to blow up, when he &s;hould give him Orders, which was as &s;oon as the Lieutenant and his Men &s;hould have en|tered, that &s;o he might have de&s;troy'd his Conque|rors: And when the Negro found how it went with <HI>Black-beard,</HI> he could hardly be per&s;waded from that ra&s;h Action, by two Pri&s;oners that were then in the Hold of the Sloop.</P>
<P>What &s;eems a little odd, is, that &s;ome of the&s;e Men, who behaved &s;o bravely again&s;t <HI>Black-beard,</HI> went afterwards a pyrating them&s;elves, and one of them was taken along with <HI>Roberts;</HI> but I do not find that any of them were provided for, except one that was hang'd; but this is a Di|gre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant cau&s;ed <HI>Black-beard</HI>'s Head, to be &s;evered from his Body, and hung up at the Bolt|&s;prit End, and &s;ail'd to <HI>Bath-Town,</HI> to get Relief for his wounded Men.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that in rummaging the Py|rate's Sloop, they found &s;everal Letters and writ|ten Papers, which di&s;covered the Corre&s;pondence betwixt Governor <HI>Eden,</HI> the Secretary and Col|lector, and al&s;o &s;ome Traders at <HI>New-York,</HI> and <HI>Black-beard.</HI> It is likely he had Regard enough for his Friends, to have de&s;troy'd the&s;e Papers before the Action, in order to hinder them from falling into &s;uch Hands, where the Di&s;covery would be of no U&s;e, either to the Intere&s;t or Reputation of the&s;e fine Gentlemen, if it had not been his fix'd Re&s;olution, to have blown up altogether, when he found no po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;caping.</P>
<P>When the Lieutenant came to <HI>Bath-Town,</HI> he made bold to &s;eize in the Governor's Store-Hou&s;e, the
<PB N="98" REF="104">
&s;ixty Hog&s;heads of Sugar, and from hone&s;t Mr. <HI>Knight,</HI> twenty; which it &s;eems was their Dividend of the Plunder taken in the <HI>French</HI> Ship; the latter did not long &s;urvive this &s;hameful Di&s;covery, for being apprehen&s;ive that he &s;hould be call'd to an Account for the&s;e Trifles, fell &s;ick with the Fright, and dy'd in a few Days.</P>
<P>After the wounded Men were pretty well reco|vered, the Lieutenant &s;ail'd back to the Men of War, in <HI>James</HI> River, in <HI>Virginia,</HI> with <HI>Black-beard</HI>'s Head &s;till hanging at the Bolt-&s;prit End, and five|teen Pri&s;oners, thirteen of whom were hang'd. It appearing upon Tryal, that one of them, <HI>viz. Samuel Odell,</HI> was taken out of the trading Sloop, but the Night before the Engagement. This poor Fellow was a little unlucky at his fir&s;t entering up|on his new Trade, there appearing no le&s;s than 70 Wounds upon him after the Action, notwith&s;tand|ing which, he liv'd, and was cur'd of them all. The other Per&s;on that e&s;cap'd the Gallows, was one <HI>I&s;rael Hands,</HI> the Ma&s;ter of <HI>Black-beard</HI>'s Sloop, and formerly Captain of the &s;ame, before the <HI>Queen Ann's Revenge</HI> was lo&s;t in <HI>Top&s;ail</HI> Inlet.</P>
<P>The afore&s;aid <HI>Hands</HI> happened not to be in the Fight, but was taken afterwards a&s;hore at <HI>Bath-Town,</HI> having been &s;ometime before di&s;abled by <HI>Black-beard,</HI> in one of his &s;avage Humours, after the following Manner.&mdash;One Night drinking in his Cabin with <HI>Hands,</HI> the Pilot, and another Man; <HI>Black-beard</HI> without any Provocation privately draws out a &s;mall Pair of Pi&s;tols, and cocks them under the Table, which being perceiv'd by the Man, he withdrew, and went upon Deck, leaving <HI>Hands,</HI> the Pilot, and the Captain together. When the Pi&s;tols were ready, he blew out the Candle, and cro&s;&s;ing his Hands, di&s;charged them at his Com|pany; <HI>Hands,</HI> the Ma&s;ter, was &s;hot thro' the Knee, and lam'd for Life; the other Pi&s;tol did no Execu|tion.&mdash;Being
<PB N="99" REF="105">
ask'd the meaning of this, he only an&s;wered, by damning them, that <HI>if he did not now and then kill one of them, they would forget who he was.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hands</HI> being taken, was try'd and condemned, but ju&s;t as he was about to be executed, a Ship arrives at <HI>Virginia</HI> with a Proclamation for prolonging the Time of his Maje&s;ty's Pardon, to &s;uch of the Pyrates as &s;hould &s;urrender by a limi|ted Time therein expre&s;&s;ed: Notwith&s;tanding the Sentence, <HI>Hands</HI> pleaded the Pardon, and was al|lowed the Benefit of it, and is alive at this Time in <HI>London,</HI> begging his Bread.</P>
<P>Now that we have given &s;ome Account of <HI>Thatch</HI>'s Life and Actions, it will not be ami&s;s, that we &s;peak of his Beard, &s;ince it did not a little contri|bute towards making his Name &s;o terrible in tho&s;e Parts.</P>
<P><HI>Plutarch,</HI> and other grave Hi&s;torians, have taken Notice, that &s;everal great Men among&s;t the <HI>Ro|mans,</HI> took their Sir-Names from certain odd Marks in their Countenances; as <HI>Cicero,</HI> from a Mark or Vetch on his No&s;e; &s;o our Heroe, Captain <HI>Thatch,</HI> a&s;&s;umed the Cognomen of <HI>Black-beard,</HI> from that large Quantity of Hair, which like a frightful Me|teor, covered his whole Face, and frightn'd <HI>Ame|rica,</HI> more than any Comet that has appear'd there a long Time.</P>
<P>This Beard was black, which he &s;uffered to grow of an extravagant Length; as to Breadth, it came up to his Eyes; he was accu&s;tomed to twi&s;t it with Ribbons, in &s;mall Tails, after the Manner of our Ramellies Wigs, and turn them about his Ears: In Time of Action, he wore a Sling over his Shoulders, with three brace of Pi&s;tols, hanging in Hol&s;ters like Bandaliers; he wore a Fur-Cap, and &s;tuck a lighted Match on each Side, under it, which ap|pearing
<PB N="100" REF="106">
on each &s;ide his Face, his Eyes naturally looking Fierce and Wild, made him altogether &s;uch a Figure, that Imagination cannot form an Idea of a Fury, from Hell, to look more frightful.</P>
<P>If he had the look of a Fury, his Humours and Pa&s;&s;ions, were &s;uitable to it; we &s;hall relate two or three more of his Extravagancies, which we omitted in the Body of his Hi&s;tory, by which it will appear, to what a pitch of Wickedne&s;s, hu|man Nature may arrive, if it's Pa&s;&s;ions are not check'd.</P>
<P>In the Commonwealth of Pyrates, he who goes the greate&s;t length of Wickedne&s;s, is looked upon with a kind of Envy among&s;t them, as a Per&s;on of a more extraordinary Gallantry, and is thereby entitled to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;ome Po&s;t, and if &s;uch a one has but Courage, he mu&s;t certainly be a great Man. The Hero of whom we are writing was thoroughly accompli&s;hed this Way, and &s;ome of his Frolicks of Wickedne&s;s, were &s;o extrava|gant, as if he aim'd at making his Men believe he was a Devil incarnate; for being one Day at Sea, and a little flu&s;hed with drink:<HI>&mdash;Come,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>let us make a Hell of our own, and try how long we can bear it;</HI> accordingly he, with two or three others, went down into the Hold, and clo&s;ing up all the Hatches, fill'd &s;everal Pots full of Brim&s;tone, and other combu&s;tible Matter, and &s;et it on Fire, and &s;o continued till they were almo&s;t &s;uffocated, when &s;ome of the Men cried out for Air; at length he open'd the Hatches, not a little plea&s;ed that he held out the longe&s;t.</P>
<P>The Night before he was kill'd, he &s;et up and drank the whole Night, with &s;ome of his own Men, and the Ma&s;ter of a Merchant-Man, and ha|ving had Intelligence of the two Sloops coming to
<PB N="101" REF="107">
attack him, as has been before ob&s;erved; one of his Men ask'd him, in Ca&s;e any thing &s;hould hap|pen to him in the Engagement, with the Sloops, whether his Wife knew where he had buried his Money? He an&s;wered, <HI>That no Body but him&s;elf, and the Devil, knew where it was, and the longe&s;t Liver &s;hould take all.</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e of his Crew who were taken alive, told a Story which may appear a little incredible; however, we think it will not be fair to omit it, &s;ince we had it from their own Mouths. That once upon a Crui&s;e, they found out, that they had a Man on Board more than their Crew; &s;uch a one was &s;een &s;everal Days among&s;t them, &s;ometimes below, and &s;ometimes upon Deck, yet no Man in the Ship could give an Account who he was, or from whence he came; but that he di&s;appeard a little before they were ca&s;t away in their great Ship, as has been related in the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Bonnet;</HI> but, it &s;eems, they all verily believed it was the Devil.</P>
<P>One would think, the&s;e Things &s;hould induce them to reform their Lives, but &s;o many Repro|bates together, encouraged and &s;pirited one ano|ther up in their Wickedne&s;s, to which a conti|nual Cour&s;e of drinking did not a little contribute; for in <HI>Black-beard</HI>'s Journal, which was taken, there were &s;everal Memorandums of the follow|ing Nature, found writ with his own Hand.<HI>&mdash;Such a Day, Rum all out:&mdash;Our Company &s;omewhat &s;ober:&mdash;A damn'd Confu&s;ion among&s;t us!&mdash;Rogues a plotting;&mdash;great Talk of Separation.&mdash;So I lock'd &s;harp for a Prize;&mdash;&s;uch a Day, took one, with a great deal of Liquor on Board, &s;o kept the Company hot, damn'd hot, then all Things went well again.</HI></P>
<P>Thus it was the&s;e Wretches pa&s;s'd their Lives, with very little Plea&s;ure or Satisfaction, in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what they violently take away from
<PB N="102" REF="108">

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. OF Captain <HI>Charles Vane,</HI> And his CREW.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CHarles Vane</HI> was one of tho&s;e, who &s;tole away the Silver which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had fi&s;hed up from the Wrecks of the Galleons, in the Gulph of <HI>Florida,</HI> and was at <HI>Providence</HI> (as has been before hinted) when Governor <HI>Rogers</HI> arrived there, with two Men of War.</P>
<P>All the Pyrates who were found at this Colony of Rogues, &s;ubmitted, and received Certificates of their Pardon, except Captain <HI>Vane</HI> and his Crew; who, as &s;oon as they &s;aw the Men of War enter, &s;lipped their Cable, &s;et Fire to a Prize they had in the Harbour, and &s;ailed out with their Pyratical Colours flying, firing at one of the Men of War, as they went off.</P>
<P>Two Days after they were out, they met with a Sloop belonging to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> which they made Prize of, and kept the Ve&s;&s;el for their own U&s;e, putting aboard five and twenty Hands, with one <HI>Yeats</HI> to Command them. A Day or two after|wards they fell in with a &s;mall interloping Trader, with a Quantity of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Pieces of Eight aboard, bound into <HI>Providence,</HI> call'd the <HI>John and Elizabeth,</HI>
<PB N="104" REF="110">
which they al&s;o took along with them. With the&s;e two Sloops, <HI>Vane</HI> went to a &s;mall I&s;land and cleaned, where they &s;hared their Booty, and &s;pent &s;ome Time in a riotous manner of Living, as is the Cu&s;tom of the Pyrates.</P>
<P>The latter End of <HI>May</HI> 1718, they &s;ail'd; and being in want of Provi&s;ions, they beat up for the Windward I&s;lands, and met with a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Sloop bound from <HI>Porto Rico</HI> to the <HI>Havana,</HI> which they burnt, and &s;towed the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in a Boat, and left them to get to the I&s;land, by the light of their Ve&s;|&s;el. But &s;teering between St. <HI>Chri&s;tophers</HI> and <HI>An|guilla,</HI> they fell in with a Brigantine and a Sloop, with the Cargo they wanted; from whom they got Provi&s;ions for Sea-Store.</P>
<P>Sometime after this, &s;tanding to the Northward, in the Track the <HI>Old-England</HI> Ships take in their Voyage to the <HI>American</HI> Colonies, they took &s;e|veral Ships and Ve&s;&s;els, which they plundered of what they thought fit, and let them pa&s;s.</P>
<P>The latter End of <HI>Augu&s;t, Vane,</HI> with his Con&s;ort <HI>Yeats,</HI> came off <HI>South Carolina,</HI> and took a Ship be|longing to <HI>Ip&s;wich,</HI> one <HI>Cogger&s;hall</HI> Commander, laden with Logwood, which was thought convenient enough for their own Bu&s;ine&s;s, and therefore order|ed their Pri&s;oners to work, and throw all the La|ding over-beard; but when they had more than half cleared the Ship, the Whim changed, and then they would not have her; &s;o <HI>Cogger&s;hall</HI> had his Ship again, and he was &s;uffered to pur&s;ue his Voyage home. In this Cruize, the Rover took &s;everal other Ships and Ve&s;&s;els, particularly a Sloop from <HI>Barbadoes, Dill</HI> Ma&s;ter; a &s;mall Ship from <HI>Antegoa, Cock</HI> Ma&s;ter; a Sloop belonging to <HI>C$racca, Richards</HI> Ma&s;ter; and a large Brigantine, Captain <HI>Thomp&s;on,</HI> from <HI>Guiney,</HI> with ninety odd Negroes aboard. The Pyrates plundered them all and let them go, putting the Negroes out of the
<PB N="105" REF="111">
Brigantine aboard of <HI>Yeats</HI>'s Ve&s;&s;el, by which Means they came back again to the right Owners.</P>
<P>For Captain <HI>Vane,</HI> having always treated his Con&s;ort with very little Re&s;pect, a&s;&s;uming a Supe|riority over <HI>Yeats</HI> and his &s;mall Crew, and regard|ing the Ve&s;&s;el but as a Tender to his own; gave them a Di&s;gu&s;t, who thought them&s;elves as good Pyrates and as great Rogues as the be&s;t of them; &s;o they caball'd together, and re&s;olved to take the fir&s;t Opportunity to leave the Company; and accept of his Maje&s;ty's Pardon, or &s;et up for them&s;elves, either of which they thought more honourable than to be Servants to the former; but the putting aboard &s;o many <HI>Negroes,</HI> where there were &s;o few Hands to take Care of them, very much enraged them, though they thought fit to conceal or &s;tifle their Re&s;entments at that Time.</P>
<P>A Day or two afterwards, the Pyrates lying off at Anchor, <HI>Yeats</HI> in the Evening &s;lip'd his Cable, and put his Ve&s;&s;el under Sail, &s;tanding into the Shore; which when <HI>Vane</HI> &s;aw, he was highly pro|voked, and got his Sloop under Sail to cha&s;e his Con&s;ort, who he plainly perceived, had a Mind to have no further Affairs with him: <HI>Vane</HI>'s Brigan|tine &s;ailed be&s;t, he gained ground of <HI>Yeats,</HI> and would certainly have come up with him, had he had a little longer Run for it; but he ju&s;t got over the Bar, when <HI>Vane</HI> come within Gun-Shot of him, who fired a Broad&s;ide at his old Friend, (which did no Damage,) and &s;o took Leave of him.</P>
<P><HI>Yeats</HI> came into <HI>North Edi&s;to</HI> River, about ten Leagues Southward of <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> and &s;ent an Expre&s;s to the Governor, to know if he and his Comrades might have the Benefit of his Maje&s;ty's Pardon, and they would Surrender them&s;elves to his Mercy, with the Sloop and Negroes; which being granted, they all came up and received Cer|tificates; and Captain <HI>Thomp&s;on,</HI> from whom the
<PB N="106" REF="112">
Negroes were taken, had them re&s;tored to him, for the U&s;e of his Owners.</P>
<P><HI>Vane</HI> crui&s;ed &s;ome Time off the Bar, in Hopes to catch <HI>Yeats,</HI> at his coming out again, but there|in he was di&s;appointed; however, he unfortunately for them, took two Ships from <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> bound home to <HI>England;</HI> one of them was call'd the <HI>Em|peror,</HI> of 360 Tuns, which was forced to return back for &s;uch Nece&s;&s;aries as <HI>Vane</HI> had plunder'd her of. It happened that ju&s;t at this Time, two Sloops, well mann'd and arm'd, were equipp'd to go after a Pyrate, which the Governor of <HI>South-Carolina</HI> was informed, lay then in Cape <HI>Fear</HI> River, a clean|ing: But Colonel <HI>Rhet,</HI> who commanded the Sloops, meeting with the <HI>Emperor,</HI> going over the Bar, and She giving the Colonel an Account of her being taken by the Pyrate <HI>Vane,</HI> and al&s;o, that &s;ome of her Men, while they were Pri&s;oners on Board of him, had heard the Pyrates &s;ay, they &s;hould clean in one of the Rivers to the South|ward, he altered his fir&s;t De&s;ign, and in&s;tead of &s;tanding to the Northward, in pur&s;uit of the Pyrate in Cape <HI>Fear</HI> River, he turns to the Southward after <HI>Vane;</HI> who had ordered &s;uch Reports to be given out, on purpo&s;e to &s;end any Force that &s;hould come after him, upon a wrong Scent; for in rea|lity, he &s;tood away to the Northward; &s;o that the Pur&s;uit proved to be the contrary Way.</P>
<P>Colonel <HI>Rhet's</HI> &s;peaking with this Ship, was the mo&s;t unlucky Thing that could have happened, be|cau&s;e it turned him out of the Road, which, in all Probability, would have brought him into the Com|pany of <HI>Vane,</HI> as well as of the Pyrate he went after; and &s;o they might have been both de&s;troy'd; whereas by the Colonel's going a different Way, he not only lo&s;t the Opportunity of meeting with one, but if the other had not been infatuated, to lye &s;ix Weeks together at Cape <HI>Fear,</HI> he would
<PB N="107" REF="113">
have mi&s;&s;ed of him likewi&s;e: However, the Colo|nel having &s;earched the Rivers and Inlets, as directed, for &s;everal Days, without Succe&s;s, at length &s;ailed in Pro&s;ecution of his fir&s;t De&s;ign, and met with the Pyrate accordingly, whom he fought and took, as has been before &s;poken of, in the Hi|&s;tory of Major <HI>Bonnet.</HI></P>
<P>Captain <HI>Vane</HI> went into an Inlet to the North|ward, where he met with Captain <HI>Thatch,</HI> or <HI>Teatch,</HI> otherwi&s;e call'd <HI>Black-beard,</HI> whom he &s;aluted (when he found who he was) with his great Guns, loaded with Shot, (as is the Cu&s;tom among Pyrates when they meet,) which are fired wide, or up into the Air: <HI>Black-beard</HI> an&s;wered the Salute in the &s;ame Manner, and mutual Civilities pa&s;&s;ed for &s;ome Days; when about the Begining of <HI>October, Vane</HI> took leave, and &s;ailed further to the Northward.</P>
<P>On the 23d of <HI>October,</HI> off of <HI>Long I&s;land, Vane</HI> took a &s;mall Brigantine, bound from <HI>Jamaica</HI> to <HI>Salem</HI> in <HI>New-England, John Shattock</HI> Ma&s;ter, and a little Sloop; they rifled the Brigantine and &s;ent her away. From hence they re&s;olved on a Cruize be|tween Cape <HI>Mei&s;e</HI> and Cape <HI>Nicholas,</HI> where they &s;pent &s;ome Time, without &s;eeing or &s;peaking with any Ve&s;&s;el, till the latter End of <HI>November,</HI> they fell upon a Ship, which 'twas expected would have &s;truck as &s;oon as their black Colours were hoi&s;ted; but in&s;tead of that, &s;he delivered a Broad&s;ide upon the Pyrate, and hoi&s;ted Colours, which &s;hewed her to be a <HI>French</HI> Man of War. <HI>Vane</HI> de&s;ired to have nothing further to &s;ay to her, but trim'd his Sails, and &s;tood away from the <HI>French-Man;</HI> but <HI>Mon&s;ieur</HI> having a Mind to be better informed, who he was, &s;et all his Sails, and crowded after him. During this Chace, the Pyrates were divided in their Re&s;olutions what to do: <HI>Vane,</HI> the Captain, was for making off as fa&s;t as they could, alledging
<PB N="108" REF="114">
the Man of War was too &s;trong to cope with; but one <HI>John Rackam,</HI> who was an Officer, that had a kind of a Check upon the Captain, ro&s;e up in De|fence of a contrary Opinion, &s;aying, <HI>That tho' &s;he had more Guns and a greater Weight of Mettal, they might board her, and then the be&s;t Boys would carry the Day. Rackam</HI> was well &s;econded, and the Majority was for boarding; but <HI>Vane</HI> urged, <HI>that it was too ra&s;h and de&s;perate an Enterprize, the Man of War ap|pearing to be twice their Force; and that their Brigan|tine might be &s;unk by her, before they could reach aboard.</HI> The Mate, one <HI>Robert Deal</HI> was of <HI>Vane's</HI> Opinion, as were about fifteen more, and all the re&s;t joined with <HI>Rackam</HI> the Quarter-Ma&s;ter. At length the Captain made U&s;e of his Power, to determine this Di&s;pute, which in the&s;e Ca&s;es, is ab&s;olute and un|controulable, by their own Laws, <HI>viz.</HI> in <HI>fighting, chacing, or being cha&s;ed;</HI> in all other Matters what|&s;oever, he is governed by the Majority; &s;o the Brigantine having the Heels, as they term it, of the <HI>French</HI> Man, &s;he came clear off.</P>
<P>But the next Day, the Captain's Behaviour was obliged to &s;tand the Te&s;t of a Vote, and a Re&s;o|lution was pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t his Honour and Dignity, branding him with the Name of Coward, depo|&s;ing him from the Command, and turning him out of the Company, with Marks of Infamy; and with him, went all tho&s;e who did not Vote for boarding the <HI>French</HI> Man of War. They had with them a &s;mall Sloop, that had been taken by them &s;ome Time before, which they gave to <HI>Vane,</HI> and the di&s;carded Members; and that they might be in a Condition to provide for them&s;elves, by their own hone&s;t Endeavours, they let them have a &s;ufficient Quantity of Provi&s;ions and Ammuni|tion along with them.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="115">
<HI>John Rackam</HI> was voted Captain of the Brigantine, in <HI>Vane</HI>'s Room, and proceeded towards the <HI>Caribee I&s;lands,</HI> where we mu&s;t leave him, till we have fini&s;hed our Story of <HI>Charles Vane.</HI></P>
<P>The Sloop &s;ailed for the Bay of <HI>Honduras,</HI> and <HI>Vane</HI> and his Crew, put her into as good a Condi|tion as they could, by the Way, to follow the old Trade. They crui&s;ed two or three Days off the North We&s;t Part of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and took a Sloop and two Pettiaga's, and all the Men entered with them; the Sloop they kept, and <HI>Robert Deal</HI> went Captain of her.</P>
<P>The 16th of <HI>December,</HI> the two Sloops came in|to the Bay, where they found only one Sloop at an Anchor, call'd the <HI>Pearl</HI> of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> Captain <HI>Charles Rowling</HI> Ma&s;ter, who got under Sail at the Sight of them; but the Pyrate Sloops coming near <HI>Rowling</HI>'s Sloop, and &s;hewing no Colours, he fired at them; whereupon, they hoi&s;ted the black Flag, and fired three Guns each, at the <HI>Pearl;</HI> upon which &s;he &s;truck, and the Pyrates took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her, and carried her away with them to a &s;mall I&s;land called <HI>Barnacko,</HI> and there cleaned, meeting in the Way with a Sloop from <HI>Jamaica,</HI> Captain <HI>Wallden</HI> Commander, going down to the Bay, which they made Prize of.</P>
<P>In <HI>February, Vane</HI> &s;ail'd from <HI>Barnacko,</HI> in order for a Cruize; but &s;ome Days after he was out, a violent Turnado overtook him, which &s;eparated him from his Con&s;ort, and after two Days Di&s;tre&s;s, threw his Sloop upon a &s;mall uninhabited I&s;land, near the Bay of <HI>Honduras,</HI> where &s;he was &s;taved to Pieces, and mo&s;t of her Men drowned: <HI>Vane</HI> him|&s;elf was &s;aved, but reduced to great Streights, for want of Nece&s;&s;aries, having no Opportunity to get any Thing from the Wreck. He lived here &s;ome Weeks, and was &s;ub&s;i&s;ted chiefly by Fi&s;hermen,
<PB N="110" REF="116">
who frequented the I&s;land, with &s;mall Craft, from the Main, to catch Turtles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>While <HI>Vane</HI> was upon this I&s;land, a Ship put in from <HI>Jamaica</HI> for Water, the Captain of which, one <HI>Holford,</HI> an old Buccaneer, happened to be <HI>Vane</HI>'s Acquaintance; he thought this a good Opportu|nity to get off, and accordingly apply'd to his old Friend; but he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed him, &s;aying to him, Charles, <HI>I &s;han't tru&s;t you aboard my Ship, un|le&s;s I carry you a Pri&s;oner, for I &s;hall have you caballing with my Men, knock me in the Head, and run away with my Ship a-pyrating. Vane</HI> made all the Prote&s;tations of Honour in the World to him; but it &s;eems Captain <HI>Holford</HI> was too intimately acquainted with him, to repo&s;e any Confidence at all in his Words or Oaths. He told him, <HI>he might ea&s;ily find a Way to get off, if he had a Mind to it: I am now go|ing down the Bay,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>and &s;hall return hither, in about a Month; and if I find you upon the I&s;land when I come back, I'll carry you to</HI> Jamaica <HI>and hang you. Which Way can I get away?</HI> An&s;wers <HI>Vane. Are there not Fi&s;hermen's Dories upon the Beach? can't you take one of them?</HI> Replies <HI>Holford. What,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Vane, would you have me &s;teal a Dory then? Do you make it a Matter of Con&s;cience?</HI> Said <HI>Holford</HI> again, <HI>to &s;teal a Dory, when you have been a common Robber and Pyrate, &s;tealing Ships and Cargoes, and plundering all Mankind that fell in your Way? Stay there and be d&mdash;n'd, if you are &s;o Squeami&s;h:</HI> And &s;o left him.</P>
<P>After Captain <HI>Holford</HI>'s Departure, another Ship put in to the &s;ame I&s;land in her Way home, for Water; none of who&s;e Company knowing <HI>Vane,</HI> he ea&s;ily pa&s;&s;ed upon them for another Man, and &s;o was &s;hipped for the Voyage. One would be apt to think that <HI>Vane</HI> was now pretty &s;afe, and likely to e&s;cape the Fate which his Crimes had merited; but here a cro&s;s Accident happened, that was <HI>Vane</HI>'s
<PB N="111" REF="117">
Ruin. <HI>Holford</HI> returning from the Bay, was met with by this Ship; the Captains being very well acquainted together, <HI>Holford</HI> was invited to dine aboard of him, which he did; and as he pa&s;&s;ed a long to the Cabin, he chanced to ca&s;t his Eye down the Hold, and there &s;aw <HI>Charles Vane</HI> at Work; he immediately &s;poke to the Captain, &s;aying, <HI>Do you know who you have got aboard here? Why,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I have &s;hipped a Man at &s;uch an I&s;land, who was ca&s;t away in a trading Sloop, he &s;eems to be a brisk Hand. I tell you,</HI> &s;ays Captain <HI>Holford, it is</HI> Vane <HI>the notorious Pyrate. If it be him,</HI> replies the other, <HI>I won't keep him: Why then,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Holford, I'll &s;end and take him aboard, and Surrender him at</HI> Jamaica. Which being agreed to, Captain <HI>Holford,</HI> as &s;oon as he returned to his Ship, &s;ent his Boat with his Mate armed, who coming to <HI>Vane,</HI> &s;hewed him a Pi&s;tol, and told him, <HI>he was his Pri&s;oner;</HI> which none oppo&s;ing, he was brought aboard and put in Irons; and when Captain <HI>Holford</HI> arrived at <HI>Jamaica,</HI> he delivered his old Accquaintance into the Hands of Ju&s;tice; at which Place he was tryed, convicted and exe|cuted, as was &s;ome Time before <HI>Vane</HI>'s Con&s;ort, <HI>Robert Deal,</HI> brought thither by one of the Men of War.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. OF Captain <HI>John Rackam,</HI> And his CREW.</HEAD>
<P>THIS <HI>John Rackan</HI> as has been mentioned in the la&s;t Chapter, was Quarter-Ma&s;ter to <HI>Vane</HI>'s Company, till they were divided, and <HI>Vane</HI> turned out for refu&s;ing to board and fight the <HI>French</HI> Man of War; then <HI>Rackam</HI> was voted Captain of that Divi&s;ion that remained in the Bri|gantine. The 24th of <HI>November</HI> 1718, was the fir&s;t Day of his Command, and his fir&s;t Cruize was among the <HI>Carribee I&s;lands,</HI> where he took and plun|der'd &s;everal Ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>We have already taken Notice, that when Cap|tain <HI>Woodes Rogers</HI> went to the I&s;land of <HI>Providence,</HI> with the King's Pardon to &s;uch as &s;hould Surren|der; this Brigantine which <HI>Rackam</HI> now command|ed, made its E&s;cape, through another Pa&s;&s;age, bid|ding Defiance to Mercy.</P>
<P>To Windward of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> a <HI>Madera</HI> Man fell into the Pyrates Way, which they detained two or three Days, till they had made their Market out of her, and then gave her back to the Ma&s;ter, and permitted one <HI>Ho&s;ea Ti&s;dell,</HI> a Tavern-Keeper at <HI>Jamaica,</HI> who had been picked up in one of their
<PB N="113" REF="119">
Prizes, to depart in her, &s;he being then bound for that I&s;land.</P>
<P>After this Cruize, they went into a &s;mall I&s;land and cleaned, and &s;pent their <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> a&s;hore, drink|ing and carou&s;ing as long as they had any Liquor left, and then went to Sea again for more, where they &s;ucceeded but too well, tho' they took no extraordinary Prize, for above two Months, ex|cept a Ship laden with Thieves from <HI>Newgate,</HI> bound for the Plantations, which in few Days, was retaken with all her Cargo, by an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man of War.</P>
<P>What became of <HI>Rackam</HI> after this, for above a twelve Month, I have not been able to di&s;cover; it is my Opinion, he was either cha&s;ed a&s;hore, by &s;ome &s;uperiour Force, or ca&s;t by Di&s;tre&s;s upon one of the &s;mall uninhabited I&s;lands, where he re|mained till he found an Opportunity to get off; for I find him in <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1720, upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Ja|maica,</HI> in a &s;mall Sloop, with a few Hands, &s;cour|ing the Harbours and Inlets, on the North and We&s;t Part of it, among the Fi&s;hermen and &s;mall Craft, which was but low Game for him to run at.</P>
<P>In the Beginning of <HI>September,</HI> they took &s;even or eight Fi&s;hing-Boots in <HI>Harbour I&s;land,</HI> &s;tole their Nets and other Tackle, and then went off the <HI>French</HI> Part of <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> and landed, and took Cattle away, with two or three <HI>French</HI> Men they found near the Water-Side, hunting of wild Hogs in the Evening: The <HI>French</HI> Men came on Board, whether by Con&s;ent or Compul&s;ion, I can't &s;ay. They afterwards plundered two Sloops, and re|turned to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> on the North Coa&s;t of which I&s;land, near <HI>Porto Maria</HI> Bay, they took a Scooner, <HI>Thomas Spenlow</HI> Ma&s;ter; it was then the 19th of <HI>October.</HI> The next Day, <HI>Rackam</HI> &s;eeing a Sloop in <HI>Dry Harbour</HI> Bay, he &s;tood in, and fired a Gun;
<PB N="114" REF="120">
the Men all run a&s;hore, and he took the Sloop and Lading, but when tho&s;e a&s;hore found them to be Pyrates, they hailed the Sloop, and let them know they were all willing to come aboard of them.</P>
<P><HI>Rackam</HI>'s coa&s;ting the I&s;land in this Manner, pro|ved fatal to him, for Intelligence came to the Go|vernor, of his Expedition, by a Canoa which he had &s;urprized a&s;hore, in <HI>Ocho</HI> Bay; upon which a Sloop was immediately fitted out, and &s;ent round the I&s;land, in que&s;t of him, commanded by Cap|tain <HI>Barnet,</HI> with a good Number of Hands. <HI>Ra|ckam</HI> rounding the I&s;land, and drawing near the We&s;termo&s;t Point, called Point <HI>Negril,</HI> &s;aw a &s;mall Pettiauger, which at &s;ight of the Sloop, went a&s;hore and landed her Men; when one of them hailed her, An&s;wer was made, <HI>They were</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Men,</HI> and de&s;ired the Pettiauger's Men to come on Board, and drink a Bowl of Punch, which they were prevailed upon to do; accordingly the Com|pany came all aboard of the Pyrate, con&s;i&s;ting of nine Per&s;ons, in an ill Hour; they were arm'd with Muskets and Cutla&s;hes, but, what was their real De&s;ign by &s;o doing, I &s;hall not take upon me to &s;ay; but they had no &s;ooner laid down their Arms, and taken up their Pipes, but <HI>Barnet</HI>'s Sloop, which was in Pur&s;uit of <HI>Rackam</HI>'s, came in Sight.</P>
<P>The Pyrates finding &s;he &s;tood directly towards her, fear'd the Event, and weighed their Anchor, which they but lately let go, and &s;tood off: Cap|tain <HI>Barnet</HI> gave them Chace, and having the Ad|vantage of little Breezes of Wind, which blew off the Land, came up with her, and, after a very &s;mall Di&s;pute, took her, and brought her into <HI>Port Royal,</HI> in <HI>Jamaica.</HI></P>
<P>In about a Fortnight after the Pri&s;oners were brought a&s;hore, <HI>viz. November</HI> 16, 1720, a Court of Admiralty was held at St. <HI>Jago de la Vega,</HI> be|fore which the following Per&s;ons were convicted,
<PB N="115" REF="121">
and Sentence of Death pa&s;&s;ed upon them, by the Pre&s;ident, Sir <HI>Nicholas Laws, viz. John Rackam</HI> Cap|tain, <HI>George Fether&s;ton</HI> Ma&s;ter, <HI>Richard Corner</HI> Quarter-Ma&s;ter, <HI>John Davis, John Howell, Patrick Carty, Tho|mas Earl, James Dobbin</HI> and <HI>Noah Harwood.</HI> The fir&s;t five were executed the next Day at <HI>Gallows Point,</HI> at the Town of <HI>Port Royal,</HI> and the re&s;t, the Day after, at <HI>King&s;ton; Rackam, Fether&s;ton</HI> and <HI>Corner,</HI> were afterwards taken down and hang'd up in Chains, one at <HI>Plumb Point,</HI> one at <HI>Bu&s;h Key,</HI> and the other at <HI>Gun Key.</HI></P>
<P>But what was very &s;urprizing, was, the Con|viction of the nine Men that came aboard the Sloop the &s;ame Day &s;he was taken. They were try'd at an Adjournment of the Court, on the 24th <HI>January,</HI> waiting all that Time, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, for Evidence, to prove the pyratical Intention of go|ing aboard the &s;aid Sloop; for it &s;eems there was no Act of Pyracy committed by them, after their coming on Board, as appeared by the Witne&s;&s;es again&s;t them, who were two <HI>French</HI> Men taken by <HI>Rackam,</HI> off from the I&s;land of <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> and de|po&s;ed in the following Manner.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;That the Pri&s;oners at the Bar, <HI>viz. John Eaton, Edward Warner, Thomas Baker, Thomas Quick, John Cole, Benjamin Palmer, Walter Rou&s;e, John Han&s;on,</HI> and <HI>John Howard</HI> came aboard the Pyrate's Sloop at <HI>Negril Point, Rackam</HI> &s;ending his Canoe a&s;hore for that Purpo&s;e: That they brought Guns and Cutla&s;hes on Board with them: That when Cap|tain <HI>Barnet</HI> cha&s;ed them, &s;ome were drinking, and others walking the Deck: That there was a great Gun and a &s;mall Arm fired by the Pyrate Sloop, at Captain <HI>Barnet</HI>'s Sloop, when he cha&s;ed her; and that when Captain <HI>Barnet</HI>'s Sloop fired at <HI>Rackam</HI>'s Sloop, the Pri&s;oners at the Bar went down under Deck. That during the Time Cap|tain <HI>Barnet</HI> $Word$ them, &s;ome of the Pri&s;oners

at the Bar (but which of them he could not tell) helped to row the Sloop, in order to e&s;cape from <HI>Barnet:</HI> That they all &s;eemed to be con&s;orted to|gether.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>This was the Sub&s;tance of all that was evidenced again&s;t them, the Pri&s;oners an&s;wered in their De|fence, <Q>&startq;That they had no Witne&s;&s;es: That they had bought a Pettiauger in order to go a Turtle|ing; and being at <HI>Negril Point,</HI> and ju&s;t got a&s;hore, they &s;aw a Sloop with a white Pendant coming towards them, upon which they took their Arms, and hid them&s;elves in the Bu&s;hes; That one of them hail'd the Sloop, who an&s;wer'd, <HI>They were</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Men,</HI> and de&s;ired them all to come aboard and drink a Bowl of Punch; which they at fir&s;t refu&s;ed, but afterwards with much Per&s;wa&s;ion, they went on Board, in the Sloop's Canoe, and left their own Pettiauger at Anchor: That they had been but a &s;hort Time on Board, when Cap|tain <HI>Barnet's</HI> Sloop heaved in Sight: That <HI>Rackam</HI> ordered them to help to weigh the Sloop's An|chor immediately, which they all refu&s;ed: That <HI>Rackam</HI> u&s;ed violent Means to oblige them; and that when Captain <HI>Barnet</HI> came up with them,&endq; they all readily and willingly &s;ubmitted.</Q></P>
<P>When the Pri&s;oners were taken from the Bar, and the Per&s;ons pre&s;ent being withdrawn, the Court con&s;idered the Pri&s;oners Ca&s;e, and the Ma|jority of the Commi&s;&s;ioners being of Opinion, that they were all Guilty of the Pyracy and Fe|lony they were charged with, which was, <HI>the go|ing over with a pyratical and felonious Intent to</HI> John Ra|ckam, &amp;c. <HI>then notorious Pyrates, and by them known to be &s;o,</HI> they all received Sentence of Death; which every Body mu&s;t allow proved &s;omewhat unlucky to the poor Fellows.</P>

<P>Two other Pyrates were try'd that belonged to <HI>Rackam</HI>'s Crew, and being convicted, were brought up, and asked if either of them had any Thing to &s;ay, why Sentence of Death &s;hould not pa&s;s upon them, in like Manner as had been done to all the re&s;t; and both of them pleaded their Bellies, be|ing quick with Child, and pray'd that Execution might be &s;tay'd, whereupon the Court pa&s;&s;ed Sen|tence, as in Ca&s;es of Pyracy, but ordered them back, till a proper Jury &s;hould be appointed to en|quire into the Matter.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> LIFE <HI>of</HI> MARY READ.</HEAD>
<P>NOW we are to begin a Hi&s;tory, full of &s;ur|prizing Turns and Adventures; I mean, that of <HI>Mary Read,</HI> and <HI>Ann Bonny,</HI> alias <HI>Bonn,</HI> which were the true Names of the&s;e two Pyrates; the odd Incidents of their rambling Lives, are &s;uch, that &s;ome may be tempted to think the whole Story no better than a Novel or Romance; but &s;ince it is &s;upported by many thou&s;and Witne&s;&s;es, I mean the People of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> who were pre&s;ent at their Tryals, and heard the Story of their Lives, upon the fir&s;t di&s;covery of their Sex; the Truth of it, can be no more conte&s;ted, than that there were &s;uch Men in the World, as <HI>Roberts</HI> and <HI>Black-beard,</HI> who were Pyrates.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="125">
<HI>Mary Read</HI> was born in <HI>England,</HI> her Mother was married young, to a Man who u&s;ed the Sea, who going a Voyage &s;oon after their Marriage, left her with Child, which Child prov'd to be a Boy. As to the Husband, whether he was ca&s;t away, or died in his Voyage, <HI>Mary Read</HI> could not tell; but however, he never returned more; neverthele&s;s, the Mother, who was young and airy, met with an Accident, which has often happen'd to Women who are young, and do not take a great deal of Care; which was, &s;he &s;oon proved with Child again, without a Husband to Father it, but how, or by whom, none but her&s;elf could tell, for &s;he carried a pretty good Reputation among her Neigh|bours. Finding her Burthen grew, in order to conceal her Shame, &s;he takes a formal Leave of her Husbands Relations, giving out, that &s;he went to live with &s;ome Friends of her own, in the Country: Accordingly &s;he went way, and carried with her, her young Son, at this Time, not a Year old: Soon after her Departure her Son died, but Providence in Return, was plea&s;ed to give her a Girl in his Room, of which &s;he was &s;afely delivered, in her Retreat, and this was our <HI>Mary Read.</HI></P>
<P>Here the Mother liv'd three or four Years, till what Money &s;he had was almo&s;t gone; then &s;he thought of returning to <HI>London,</HI> and con&s;idering that her Husband's Mother was in &s;ome Circum|&s;tances, &s;he did not doubt but to prevail upon her, to provide for the Child, if &s;he could but pa&s;s it upon her for the &s;ame, but the changing a Girl into a Boy, &s;eem'd a difficult Piece of Work, and how to deceive an experienced old Woman, in &s;uch a Point, was altogether as impo&s;&s;ible; however, &s;he ventured to dre&s;s it up, as a Boy, brought it to Town, and pre&s;ented it to her Mother in Law, as her Husband's Son; the old Woman would have taken it, to have bred it up, but the Mother pre|tended

it would break her Heart, to part with it; &s;o it was agreed betwixt them, that the Child &s;hould live with the Mother, and the &s;uppo&s;ed Grand|mother &s;hould allow a Crown a Week for it's Maintainance.</P>
<P>Thus the Mother gain'd her Point, &s;he bred up her Daughter as a Boy, and when &s;he grew up to &s;ome Sen&s;e, &s;he thought proper to let her into the Secret of her Birth, to induce her to conceal her Sex. It happen'd that the Grandmother died, by which Means the Sub&s;i&s;tance that came from that Quarter, ceas'd, and they were more and more reduced in their Circum&s;tances; wherefore &s;he was obliged to put her Daughter out, to wait on a <HI>French</HI> Lady, as a Foot-boy, being now thirteen Years of Age: Here &s;he did not live long, for growing bold and &s;trong, and having al&s;o a roving Mind, &s;he entered her &s;elf on Board a Man of War, where &s;he &s;erved &s;ome Time, then quitted it, went over to <HI>Flanders,</HI> and carried Arms in a Re|giment of Foot, as a <HI>Cadet;</HI> and tho' upon all Actions, &s;he behaved her&s;elf with a great deal of Bravery, yet &s;he could not get a Commi&s;&s;ion, they being gene|rally bought and &s;old; therefore &s;he quitted the Service, and took on, in a Regiment of Hor&s;e; &s;he behaved &s;o well, in &s;everal Engagements, that &s;he got the E&s;teem of all her Officers; but her Com|rade, who was a <HI>Fleming,</HI> happening to be a hand&s;ome young Fellow, &s;he falls in Love with him, and, from that Time, grew a little more negligent in her Duty, &s;o that, it &s;eems, <HI>Mars</HI> and <HI>Venus</HI> could not be &s;erved at the &s;ame Time; her Arms and Accoutrements which were always kept in the be&s;t Order, were quite neglected; 'tis true, when her Comrade was ordered out upon a Party, &s;he u&s;ed to go without being commanded, and fre|quently run her&s;elf into Danger, where &s;he had no Bu&s;ine&s;s, only to be near him; the re&s;t of the
<PB N="120" REF="127">
Troopers little &s;u&s;pecting the &s;ecret Cau&s;e which moved her to this Behaviour, fancied her to be mad, and her Comrade him&s;elf could not account for this &s;trange Alteration in her, but Love is In|genious, and as they lay in the &s;ame Tent, and were con&s;tantly together, &s;he found a Way of let|ting him di&s;cover her Sex, without appearing that it was done with De&s;ign.</P>

The&s;e Privateers were no &s;ooner &s;ail'd out, but the Crews of &s;ome of them, who had been pardo|ned, ro&s;e again&s;t their Commanders, and turn'd them&s;elves to their old Trade: In this Number was <HI>Mary Read.</HI> It is true, &s;he often declared, that the Life of a Pyrate was what &s;he always abhor'd, and went into it only upon Compul&s;ion, both this Time, and before, intending to quit it, whenever a fair Opportunity &s;hould offer it &s;elf; yet &s;ome of the Evidence again&s;t her, upon her Tryal, who were forced Men, and had &s;ail'd with her, depo&s;ed upon Oath, that in Times of Action, no Per&s;on among&s;t them was more re&s;olute, or ready to Board, or undertake any Thing that was hazardous, as &s;he and <HI>Ann Bonny;</HI> and particularly at the Time they were attack'd and taken, when they came to clo&s;e Quarters, none kept the Deck except <HI>Mary Read,</HI> and <HI>Ann Bonny,</HI> and one more; up|on which, &s;he, <HI>Mary Read,</HI> called to tho&s;e under Deck, to come up and fight like Men, and finding they did not &s;tir, fired her Arms down the Hold among&s;t them, killing one, and wounding others.</P>
<P>This was part of the Evidence again&s;t her, which &s;he denied; which, whether true or no, thus much is certain, that &s;he did not want Bravery, nor in|deed, was &s;he le&s;s remarkable for her Mode&s;ty, according to her Notions of Virtue: Her Sex was not &s;o much as &s;u&s;pected by any Per&s;on on Board, till <HI>Ann Bonny,</HI> who was not altogether &s;o re&s;erv'd in point of Cha&s;tity, took a particular liking to her; in &s;hort, <HI>Ann Bonny</HI> took her for a hand&s;ome young Fellow, and for &s;ome Rea&s;ons be&s;t known to her&s;elf, fir&s;t di&s;covered her Sex to <HI>Mary Read; Mary Read</HI> knowing what &s;he would be at, and being very &s;en&s;ible of her own Incapacity that Way, was forced to come to a right Under&s;tanding with her, and &s;o to the great Di&s;appointment of <HI>Ann Bonny,</HI> &s;he let her know &s;he was a Woman al&s;o; but this

<P>Captain <HI>Rackan,</HI> (as he was enjoin'd,) kept the Thing a Secret from all the Ships Company, yet, notwith&s;tanding all her Cunning and Re&s;erve, Love found her out in this Di&s;gui&s;e, and hinder'd her from forgetting her Sex. In their Cruize they took a great Number of Ships belonging to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and other Parts of the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> bound to, and from <HI>England;</HI> and when ever they met a good Arti&s;t, or other Per&s;on, who might be of any great U&s;e to their Company, if he was not willing to enter, it was their Cu&s;tom to keep him by Force. Among the&s;e was a young Fellow, of a mo&s;t ingage|ing Behaviour, or, at lea&s;t, he was &s;o in the Eyes of <HI>Mary Read,</HI> who became &s;o &s;mitten with his Per&s;on and Addre&s;s, that &s;he could neither re&s;t, Night or Day; but as there is nothing more inge|nious than Love, it was no hard Matter for her, who had before been practiced in the&s;e Wiles, to find a Way to let him di&s;cover her Sex: She fir&s;t in&s;inuated her &s;elf into his liking, by talking again&s;t the Life of a Pyrate, which he was altogether aver&s;e to, &s;o they became Me&s;s-Mates, and &s;trict Companions: When &s;he found he had a Friend&s;hip for her, as a Man, &s;he &s;uffered the Di&s;covery to be made, by carele&s;ly &s;hewing her Brea&s;ts, which were very White.</P>
<P>The young Fellow, who was made of Fle&s;h and Blood, had his Curio&s;ity and De&s;ire &s;o rais'd by this Sight, that he never ceas'd importuning her, till &s;he confe&s;s'd what &s;he was. Now begins the Scene of Love; as he had a Liking and E&s;teem for her, under her &s;uppo&s;ed Character, it was now turn'd into Fondne&s;s and De&s;ire; her Pa&s;&s;ion was
<PB N="124" REF="131">
no le&s;s violent than his, and perhaps &s;he expre&s;s'd it, by one of the mo&s;t generous Actions that ever Love in&s;pired. It happened this young Fellow had a Quarrel with one of the Pyrates, and their Ship then lying at Anchor, near one of the I&s;lands, they had appointed to go a&s;hore and fight, accor|ding to the Cu&s;tom of the Pyrates: <HI>Mary Read,</HI> was to the la&s;t Degree unea&s;y and anxious, for the Fate of her Lover; &s;he would not have had him refu&s;e the Challenge, becau&s;e, &s;he could not bear the Thoughts of his being branded with Cowardi&s;e; on the other Side, &s;he dreaded the Event, and ap|prehended the Fellow might be too hard for him: When Love once enters into the Brea&s;ts of one who has any Sparks of Genero&s;ity, it &s;tirs the Heart up to the mo&s;t noble Actions; in this Dilem|ma &s;he &s;hew'd, that &s;he fear'd more for his Life than &s;he did for her own; for &s;he took a Re&s;olution of quarreling with this Fellow her &s;elf, and ha|ving challenged him a&s;hore, &s;he appointed the Time two Hours &s;ooner than that when he was to meet her Lover, where &s;he fought him at Sword and Pi&s;tol, and killed him upon the Spot.</P>
<P>It is true, &s;he had fought before, when &s;he had been in&s;ulted by &s;ome of tho&s;e Fellows, but now it was altogether in her Lover's Cau&s;e, &s;he &s;tood as it were betwixt him and Death, as if &s;he could not live without him. If he had no regard for her before, this Action would have bound him to her for ever; but there was no Occa&s;ion for Ties or Obligations, his Inclination towards her was &s;uffici|ent; in fine, they applied their Troth to each other, which <HI>Ma$y Read</HI> &s;aid, &s;he look'd upon to be as good a $Word$, in Con&s;cience, as if it had been done by a Mini&s;ter in Church; and to this was $Span$ great Belly, which &s;he pleaded to &s;ave her Life.</P>

She declared &s;he had never committed Adultery or Fornication with any Man, &s;he commended the Ju&s;tice of the Court, before which &s;he was tried, for di&s;tingui&s;hing the Nature of their Crimes; her Hus|band, as &s;he call'd him, with &s;everal others, being acquitted; and being ask'd, who he was? &s;he would not tell, but, &s;aid he was an hone&s;t Man, and had no Inclinations to &s;uch Practices, and that they had both re&s;olved to leave the Pyrates, the fir&s;t Opportunity, and apply them&s;elves to &s;ome ho|ne&s;t Livelihood.</P>
<P>It is no doubt, but many had Compa&s;&s;ion for her, yet the Court could not avoid finding her Guilty; for among other Things, one of the Evidences again&s;t her, depo&s;ed, that being taken by <HI>Rackam,</HI> and detain'd &s;ome Time on Board, he fell accident|ally into Di&s;cour&s;e with <HI>Mary Read,</HI> whom he ta|king for a young Man, ask'd her, what Plea&s;ure &s;he could have in being concerned in &s;uch Enterprizes, where her Life was continually in Danger, by Fire or Sword; and not only &s;o, but &s;he mu&s;t be &s;ure of dying an ignominious Death, if &s;he &s;hould be taken alive?&mdash;She an&s;wer'd, that as to hang|ing, &s;he thought it no great Hard&s;hip, for, were it not for that, every cowardly Fellow would turn Pyrate, and &s;o infe&s;t the Seas, that Men of Courage mu&s;t &s;tarve:&mdash;That if it were put to the Choice of the Pyrates, they would not have the Puni&s;h|ment le&s;s than Death, the Fear of which, kept &s;ome da&s;tardy Rogues hone&s;t; that many of tho&s;e who are now cheating the Widows and Orphans, and oppre&s;&s;ing their poor Neighbours, who have no Money to obtain Ju&s;tice, would then rob at Sea, and the Ocean would be crowded with Rogues, like the Land, and no Merchant would venture out; &s;o that the Trade, in a little Time, would not be worth following.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> LIFE <HI>of</HI> ANNE BONNY.</HEAD>
<P>AS we have been more particular in the Lives of the&s;e two Women, than tho&s;e of other Pyrates, it is incumbant on us, as a faithful Hi&s;torian, to begin with their Birth. <HI>Anne Bonny</HI> was born at a Town near <HI>Cork,</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland,</HI> her Father being an Attorney at Law, but <HI>Anne</HI> was not one of his legitimate I&s;&s;ue, which &s;eems to cro&s;s an old Proverb, which &s;ays, <HI>that Ba|&s;tards have the be&s;t Luck.</HI> Her Father was a married Man, and his Wife having been brought to Bed, contracted an Illne&s;s in her lying in, and in order to recover her Health, &s;he was advi&s;ed to remove for Change of Air; the Place &s;he cho&s;e, was a few Miles di&s;tance from her Dwelling, where her Hus|band's Mother liv'd. Here &s;he &s;ojourn'd &s;ome Time, her Husband &s;taying at Home, to follow his Af|fairs. The Servant-maid, whom &s;he left to look after the Hou&s;e, and attend the Family, being a hand&s;ome young Woman, was courted by a young Man of the &s;ame Town, who was a <HI>Tanner;</HI> this <HI>Tanner</HI> u&s;ed to take his Opportunities, when the Family was out of the Way, of coming to pur&s;ue his Court&s;hip; and being with the Maid one Day, as &s;he was employ'd in the Hou&s;hold Bu&s;ine&s;s, not

having the Fear of God before his Eyes, he takes his Opportunity, when her Back was turn'd, of whiping three Silver Spoons into his Pocket. The Maid &s;oon mi&s;s'd the Spoons, and knowing that no Body had been in the Room, but her &s;elf and the young Man, &s;ince &s;he &s;aw them la&s;t, &s;he charg|ed him with taking them; he very &s;tifly denied it, upon which &s;he grew outragious, and threatned to go to a Con&s;table, in order to carry him before a Ju&s;tice of Peace: The&s;e Manaces frighten'd him out of his Wits, well knowing he could not &s;tand Search; wherefore he endeavoured to pacify her, by de&s;iring her to examine the Drawers and other Places, and perhaps &s;he might find them; in this Time he &s;lips into another Room, where the Maid u&s;ually lay, and puts the Spoons betwixt the Sheets, and then makes his E&s;cape by a back Door, concluding &s;he mu&s;t find them, when &s;he went to Bed, and &s;o next Day he might pretend he did it only to frighten her, and the Thing might be laugh'd off, for a Je&s;t.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he mi&s;s'd him, &s;he gave over her Search, concluding he had carried them off, and went directly to the Con&s;table, in order to have him apprehended: The young Man was inform'd, that a Con&s;table had been in Search of him, but he regarded it but little, not doubting but all would be well next Day. Three or four Days pa&s;s'd, and &s;till he was told, the Con&s;table was upon the Hunt for him; this made him lye conceal'd, he could not comprehend the Meaning of it, he imagined no le&s;s, than that the Maid had a Mind to convert the Spoons to her own U&s;e, and put the Robbery upon him.</P>
<P>It happen'd, at this Time, that the Mi&s;tre&s;s be|ing perfectly recover'd of her late Indi&s;po&s;ition, was return'd Home, in Company with her Mother in Law; the fir&s;t News &s;he heard, was of the Lo&s;s
<PB N="128" REF="135">
of the Spoons, with the Manner how; the Maid telling her, at the &s;ame Time, that the young Man was run away. The young Fellow had Intelligence of the Mi&s;tre&s;s's Arrival, and con&s;idering with him&s;elf, that he could never appear again in his Bu&s;ine&s;s, unle&s;s this Matter was got over, and &s;he being a good natured Woman, he took a Re&s;olution of going directly to her, and of telling her the whole Story, only with this difference, that he did it for a Je&s;t.</P>
<P>The Mi&s;tre&s;s could &s;carce believe it, however, &s;he went directly to the Maid's Room, and turn|ing down the Bed Cloaths, there, to her great Surprize, found the three Spoons; upon this &s;he de&s;ired the young Man to go Home and mind his Bu&s;ine&s;s, for he &s;hould have no Trouble about it.</P>
<P>The Mi&s;tre&s;s could not imagine the Meaning of this, &s;he never had found the Maid guilty of any pilfering, and therefore it could not enter her Head, that &s;he de&s;igned to &s;teal the Spoons her|&s;elf; upon the whole, &s;he concluded the Maid had not been in her Bed, from the Time the Spoons were mi&s;s'd, &s;he grew immediately jealous upon it, and &s;u&s;pected, that the Maid &s;upplied her Place with her Husband, during her Ab&s;ence, and this was the Rea&s;on why the Spoons were no &s;ooner found.</P>
<P>She call'd to Mind &s;everal Actions of Kindne&s;s, her Husband had &s;hew'd the Maid, Things that pa&s;s'd unheeded by, when they happen'd, but now &s;he had got that Tormenter, Jealou&s;y, in her Head, amounted to Proofs of their Intimacy; another Cir|cum&s;tance which &s;trengthen'd the whole, was, that tho' her Husband knew &s;he was to come Home that Day, and had had no Communication with her in four Months, which was before her la&s;t Lying i$, yet he took an Opportunity of going out
<PB N="129" REF="136">
of Town that Morning, upon &s;ome &s;light Pretence:&mdash;All the&s;e Things put together, confirm'd her in her Jealou&s;ly.</P>
<P>As Women &s;eldom forgive Injuries of this Kind, &s;he thought of di&s;charging her Revenge upon the Maid: In order to this, &s;he leaves the Spoons where &s;he found them, and orders the Maid to put clean Sheets upon the Bed, telling her, &s;he intended to lye there her &s;elf that Night, becau&s;e her Mother in Law was to lye in her Bed, and that &s;he (the Maid) mu&s;t lye in another Part of the Hou&s;e; the Maid in making the Bed, was &s;urprized with the Sight of the Spoons, but there were very good Rea&s;ons, why it was not proper for her to tell where &s;he found them, therefore &s;he takes them up, puts them in her Trunk, intending to leave them in &s;ome Place, where they might be found by Chance.</P>
<P>The Mi&s;tre&s;s, that every Thing might look to be done without De&s;ign, lyes that Night in the Maid's Bed, little dreaming of what an Adventure it would produce: After &s;he had been a Bed &s;ome Time, thinking on what had pa&s;s'd, for Jealou&s;ey kept her awake, &s;he heard &s;ome Body enter the Room; at fir&s;t &s;he apprehended it to be Thieves, and was &s;o frightned, &s;he had not Courage enough to call out; but when &s;he heard the&s;e Words, Mary, <HI>are you awake?</HI> She knew it to be her Husband's Voice; then her Fright was over, yet &s;he made no An&s;wer, lea&s;t he &s;hould find her out, if &s;he &s;poke, therefore &s;he re&s;olv'd to counterfeit Sleep, and take what follow'd.</P>
<P>The Husband came to Bed, and that Night play'd the vigorous Lover; but one Thing &s;poil'd the Diver&s;ion on the Wife's Side, which was, the Reflection that it was not de&s;ign'd for her; however &s;he was very pa&s;&s;ive, and bore it like a Chri&s;tian. Early before Day, &s;he &s;tole out of
<PB N="130" REF="137">
Bed, leaving him a&s;leep, and went to her Mother in Law, telling her what had pa&s;s'd, not forgeting how he had u&s;ed her, as taking her for the Maid; the Husband al&s;o &s;tole out, not thinking it convenient to be catch'd in that Room; in the mean Time, the Revenge of the Mi&s;tre&s;s was &s;trongly again&s;t the Maid, and without con&s;idering, that to her &s;he ow'd the Diver&s;ion of the Night before, and that one good <HI>Turn</HI> &s;hould de&s;erve another; &s;he &s;ent for a Con&s;table, and charged her with &s;tealing the Spoons: The Maid's Trunk was broke open, and the Spoons found, upon which &s;he was carried be|fore a Ju&s;tice of Peace, and by him committed to Goal.</P>
<P>The Husband loiter'd about till twelve a Clock at Noon, then comes Home, pretending he was ju&s;t come to Town; as &s;oon as he heard what had pa&s;&s;ed, in Relation to the Maid, he fell into a great Pa&s;&s;ion again&s;t the Wife; this &s;et the Thing into a greater Flame, the Mother takes the Wife's Part again&s;t her own Son, in&s;omuch that the Quarrel increa&s;ing, the Mother and Wife took Hor&s;e im|mediately, and went back to the Mother's Hou&s;e, and the Husband and Wife never bedded toge|ther after.</P>
<P>The Maid lay along Time in the Pri&s;on, it being near half a Year to the A&s;&s;izes; but before it hap|pened, it was di&s;covered &s;he was with Child; when &s;he was arraign'd at the Bar, &s;he was di&s;charged for want of Evidence; the Wife's Con&s;cience touch'd her, and as &s;he did not believe the Maid Guilty of any Theft, except that of Love, &s;he did not appear again&s;t her; &s;oon after her Acquittal, &s;he was delivered of a Girl.</P>
<P>But what alarm'd the Husband mo&s;t, was, that it was di&s;covered the Wife was with Child al&s;o, he taking it for granted, he had had no Intimacy with her, &s;ince her la&s;t lying in, grew jealous of

her, in his Turn, and made this a Handle to ju&s;ti|fie him&s;elf, for his U&s;age of her, pretending now he had &s;u&s;pected her long, but that here was Proof; &s;he was delivered of Twins, a Boy and a Girl.</P>
<P>The Mother falling ill, &s;ent to her Son to recon|cile him to his Wife, but he would not hearken to it; wherefore &s;he made a Will, leaving all &s;he had in the Hands of certain Tru&s;tees, for the U&s;e of the Wife and two Children lately born, and died a few Days after.</P>
<P>This was an ugly Turn upon him, his greate&s;t Dependance being upon his Mother; however, his Wife was kinder to him than he de&s;erved, for &s;he made him a yearly Allowance out of what was left, tho' they continued to live &s;eparate: It la&s;ted near five Years; at this Time having a great Affection for the Girl he had by his Maid, he had a Mind to take it Home, to live with him; but as all the Town knew it to be a Girl, the better to di&s;gui&s;e the Matter from them, as well as from his Wife, he had it put in Breeches, as a Boy, pre|tending it was a Relation's Child he was to breed up to be his Clerk.</P>
<P>The Wife heard he had a little Boy at Home he was very fond of, but as &s;he did not know any Relation of his that had &s;uch a Child, &s;he em|ploy'd a Friend to enquire further into it; this Per&s;on by talking with the Child, found it to be a Girl, di&s;covered that the Servant-Maid was its Mother, and that the Husband &s;till kept up his Corre&s;pondence with her.</P>
<P>Upon this Intelligence, the Wife being unwil|ling that her Children's Money &s;hould go towards the Maintenance of Ba&s;tards, &s;top'd the Allowance: The Husband inraged, in a kind of Revenge, takes the Maid home, and lives with her publickly, to the great Scandal of his Neighbours; but he &s;oon

found the bad Effect of it, for by Degrees he lo&s;t his Practice, &s;o that he &s;aw plainly he could not live there, therefore he thought of removing, and turning what Effects he had into ready Money; he goes to <HI>Cork,</HI> and there with his Maid and Daughter, embarques for <HI>Carolina.</HI></P>
<P>At fir&s;t he followed the Practice of the Law in that Province, but afterwards fell into Merchan|dize, which proved more &s;uccesful to him, for he gained by it &s;ufficient to purcha&s;e a con&s;iderable Plantation: His Maid, who pa&s;&s;ed for his Wife, happened to dye, after which his Daughter, our <HI>Anne Bonny,</HI> now grown up kept his Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>She was of a fierce and couragious Temper, wherefore, when &s;he lay under Condemnation, &s;everal Stories were reported of her, much to her Di&s;advantage, as that &s;he had kill'd an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ser|vant-Maid, once in her Pa&s;&s;ion with a Ca&s;e-Knife, while &s;he look'd after her Father's Hou&s;e; but upon further Enquiry, I found this Story to be groundle&s;s: It was certain &s;he was &s;o Robu&s;t, that once, when a young Fellow would have lain with her, again&s;t her Will, &s;he beat him &s;o, that he lay ill of it a con&s;iderable Time.</P>
<P>While &s;he lived with her Father, &s;he was look'd upon as one that would be a good Fortune, where|fore it was thought her Father expected a good Match for her; but &s;he &s;poilt all, for without his Con&s;ent, &s;he Marries a young Fellow, who be|longed to the Sea, and was not worth a Groat; which provoked her Father to &s;uch a Degree, that he turned her out of Doors, upon which the young Fellow who married her, finding him&s;elf di&s;appointed in his Expectation, &s;hipped him&s;elf and Wife, for the I&s;land of <HI>Providence,</HI> expecting Employment there.</P>
<P>Here &s;he became acquainted with <HI>Rackam</HI> the Pyrate, who making Court&s;hip to her, &s;oon found
<PB N="133" REF="140">
Means of withdrawing her Affections from her Husband, &s;o that &s;he con&s;ented to elope from him, and go to Sea with <HI>Rackam</HI> in Mens Cloaths: She was as good as her Word, and after &s;he had been at Sea &s;ome Time, &s;he proved with Child, and beginning to grow big, <HI>Rackam</HI> landed her on the I&s;land of <HI>Cuba;</HI> and recommending her there, to &s;ome Friends of his, they took Care of her, till &s;he was brought to Bed: When &s;he was up and well again, he &s;ent for her, to bear him Company.</P>
<P>The King's Proclamation being out, for pardon|ing of Pyrates, he took the Benefit of it, and &s;ur|rendered; afterwards being &s;ent upon the priva|teering Account, he returned to his old Trade, as has been already hinted, in the Story of <HI>Mary Read.</HI> In all the&s;e Expeditions, <HI>Anne Bonny</HI> bore him Com|pany, and when any Bu&s;ine&s;s was to be done in their Way, no Body was more forward or coura|gious than &s;he, and particularly when they were taken; &s;he and <HI>Mary Read,</HI> with one more, were all the Per&s;ons that dur&s;t keep the Deck, as has been before hinted.</P>
<P>Her Father was known to a great many Gentle|men, Planters of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> who had dealt with him, and among whom he had a good Reputation; and &s;ome of them, who had been in <HI>Carolina,</HI> remem|ber'd to have &s;een her in his Hou&s;e; wherefore they were inclined to &s;hew her Favour, but the Action of leaving her Husband was an ugly Cir|cum&s;tance again&s;t her. The Day that <HI>Rackam</HI> was executed, by &s;pecial Favour, he was admitted to &s;ee her; but all the Comfort &s;he gave him, was, <HI>that &s;he was &s;orry to &s;ee him there, but if he had fought like a Man, he need not have been hang'd like a Dog.</HI></P>
<P>She was continued in Pri&s;on, to the Time of her lying in, and afterwards reprieved from Time to Time; but what is become of her &s;ince, we can|not

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. OF Captain <HI>ENGLAND,</HI> And his CREW.</HEAD>
<P><HI>EDward England</HI> was a Pyrate of con&s;iderable Rank, he had the Command of a Sloop in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> in the Year 1717, when the Money was &s;tole that had been fi&s;hed up out of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Wrecks. He was &s;ome Time at <HI>Pro|vidence,</HI> but left it before the Arrival of Captain <HI>Rogers,</HI> and &s;ailed to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI> where he took &s;everal Ships and Ve&s;&s;els, particularly the <HI>Cadogan</HI> Snow from <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> at <HI>Sierraleon,</HI> Captain <HI>Skinner;</HI> who was in a barbarous and inhumane Manner murdered by Part of the Pyrate Crew, who the Voyage before had belonged to the &s;aid <HI>Skinner,</HI> and &s;erved on Board his Ve&s;&s;el; but &s;ome Difference happening, the Captain thought fit to put them on Board of a Man of War, and at the &s;ame Time refu&s;ed to pay them their Wages that was due. The&s;e Men found Means to de&s;ert that Service in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and &s;hipping them&s;elves in a Merchant Sloop, which was afterwards taken by Captain <HI>England,</HI> they entered with him. When the Pyrates made Prize of the <HI>Cadogan</HI> Snow, they
<PB N="135" REF="142">
ordered the Ma&s;ter of her to come aboard in his Boat, which he did, and the Per&s;on that he fir&s;t ca&s;t his Eye upon, proved to be his former Boat|&s;wain, who &s;tared him in the Face like his evil Genius, and acco&s;ted him in the following Manner: <HI>Ah Captain</HI> Skinner! <HI>Is it you? The only Man I wi&s;h'd to &s;ee; I am deeply in your Debt, and now I &s;hall pay you all in your own Coin.</HI> The poor Man trembled every Joint, when he found into what Company he had got, and dreaded the Event, which he had Rea&s;on enough to do; for the Boat&s;wain immediately called to his Con&s;orts, laid hold of the Captain, and made him fa&s;t to the Windle&s;s, and there pelted him with empty Gla&s;s Bottles, which broke upon his Body and cut him in a &s;ad Manner; after|wards they whipp'd him about the Deck, till they were weary, then told him, becau&s;e he was a good Ma&s;ter to his Men, he &s;hould have an ea&s;y Death, and &s;o &s;hot him thro' the Head, and tumb|led him overboard into the Sea. The chief Mate of this Snow, was <HI>Howel Davis,</HI> who is the Sub|ject of the following Chapter.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>England</HI> took a Ship, called the Pearl, Captain <HI>Tyzard,</HI> which he fitted up for his own Service, mounted her with 30 Guns, and called her the <HI>Royal James,</HI> and with her took a great Number of Ships of all Nations, on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guiney,</HI> the I&s;le of <HI>May,</HI> and the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> I&s;lands; from whence he went to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> again, but returned to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI> in <HI>March</HI> following, 1719, and in, and off the River <HI>Gambia,</HI> took the following Ships and Ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>The <HI>Eagle</HI> Pink, Captain <HI>Rickets</HI> Commander, belonging to <HI>Cork,</HI> taken the 25th of <HI>March,</HI> ha|ving 6 Guns and 17 Men on Board, &s;even of which turned Pyrates.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="143">
The <HI>Charlotte,</HI> Captain <HI>Old&s;on,</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> taken <HI>May</HI> the 26th, having 8 Guns and 18 Men on Board, 13 of which turned Pyrates.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sarah,</HI> Captain <HI>Stunt,</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> taken the 27th of <HI>May,</HI> having 4 Guns and 18 Men on Board, 3 of which turned Pyrates.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bentworth,</HI> Captain <HI>Garner,</HI> of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> taken the 27th of of <HI>May,</HI> having 12 Guns and 30 Men on Board, 12 of which turned Pyrates.</P>
<P>The <HI>Buck</HI> Sloop, Captain <HI>Sylve&s;ter,</HI> of <HI>Gambia,</HI> taken the 27 of <HI>May,</HI> having 2 Guns and 2 Men on Board, and both turned Pyrates.</P>
<P>The <HI>Carteret,</HI> Captain <HI>Snow,</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> taken the 28th of <HI>May,</HI> having 4 Guns and 18 Men on Board, 5 of which turned Pyrates.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mercury,</HI> Captain <HI>Maggott,</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> taken the 29th of <HI>May,</HI> having 4 Guns and 18 Men on Board, 5 of which turned Pyrates.</P>
<P>The <HI>Coward</HI> Galley, Captain <HI>Creed,</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> taken the 17th of <HI>June,</HI> having 2 Guns and 13 Men on Board, 4 of which turned Pyrates.</P>
<P>The <HI>Elizabeth and Katherine,</HI> Captain <HI>Bridge,</HI> of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> taken <HI>June</HI> the 27th, having 6 Guns and 14 Men on Board, 4 of which turned Pyrates.</P>
<P>The three fir&s;t were &s;ent away to <HI>Jamaica, Vir|ginia</HI> and <HI>Maryland,</HI> the two la&s;t they detained, and all the re&s;t they burnt.</P>
<P>After the taking of the&s;e Prizes, they cleaned and &s;taid &s;ix or eight Weeks, pur&s;uing their Di|ver&s;ions, which were not the mo&s;t commendable, and put to Sea again; when they came out (as is the u&s;ual Way with the Pyrates) they put it to a Vote which Way they &s;hould Sail, and the Majo|rity of the Company being for the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> they &s;hap'd their Cour&s;e for the I&s;land of <HI>Madaga&s;car.</HI></P>
<P>They &s;taid here only till they had cleaned and refitted their Ship and Ve&s;&s;els, and got aboard a
<PB N="137" REF="144">
Stock of Provi&s;ions from the Natives, which they exchanged Goods for, and then proceeded to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Malabar,</HI> where they crui&s;ed for &s;everal Months.</P>
<P><HI>Malabar</HI> is a fine fruitful Country in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> in the Empire of the <HI>Mogul,</HI> but immedia|tely Subject to its own Princes; it reaches from the Coa&s;t of <HI>Canara,</HI> to Cape <HI>Comorin,</HI> which is between 7&deg;, 30, and 12&deg; North Latitude; and in about 75 Degrees Ea&s;t Longitude, counting from the Meridian of <HI>London.</HI> The old Natives are Pagans, but there are a great Number of Mahometans in|habiting among them, who are either Merchants or Pyrates, and all very Rich. The&s;e Pyrates pay Allegiance and Taxes to tho&s;e <HI>Indian</HI> Kings, who&s;e Harbours they frequent, and they find Pro|tection as other People do; and when any Prize is taken, the Merchants make no Scruple of buy|ing their goods, and carrying on a Trade openly with them. On the &s;ame Coa&s;t, but in another Province to the Northward, lies <HI>Goa, Surat, Bombay,</HI> and &s;everal other Settlements belonging to the <HI>Engli&s;h, Dutch</HI> and <HI>Portugue&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Hither our Pyrates made their Voyage, which &s;omewhat impoveri&s;h'd the Company, not having taken any Thing in a Run of about 3300 Leagues, almo&s;t the Di&s;tance of half the Globe; but were here rewarded for all their Labour, for they plunder'd the Country Ships, and traded with their own Merchants, and &s;ometimes perhaps for their own Goods: They turned the be&s;t Part of their Cargo into Diamonds and precious Stones, of which they had got a con&s;iderable Quantity, and went back towards <HI>Madaga&s;car.</HI></P>
<P>Between the Northern Part of the above I&s;land, and the Coa&s;t of <HI>Zanquebar,</HI> lies a little I&s;land called <HI>Johanna,</HI> which our outward-bound <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Ships, at lea&s;t, tho&s;e who are bound for
<PB N="138" REF="145">
<HI>Surat,</HI> and that Way, put in for Water and Re|fre&s;hments; hither <HI>England</HI> directed his Cour&s;e, in order to look into the Harbour, and chanced to fall in with two <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Ships of near 500 Tun Burthen, each, and thirty odd Guns; a Force &s;u|perior to them; however they hoi&s;ted their black Colours, and gave them Cha&s;e. The <HI>India</HI> Ships had no Bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;peak with them, if they could help it, and therefore &s;tood from the Pyrates with all the Sail they could make; but one of them (call the <HI>Ca&s;&s;andra,</HI> in Honour of the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Chandois,</HI> Captain <HI>Mackray</HI> Commander) &s;ailing heavy, the Pyrate Ship with 24 Guns came &s;oon up with her, and engaged her; whil&s;t the other, which <HI>England</HI> the Commadore was on Board of, made after the <HI>Greenwich,</HI> Captain <HI>Kirby</HI> Commander. <HI>Mackray</HI> behaved him&s;elf very gallantly, and killed the Pyrate a great many Men, and would certain|ly have de&s;troyed him, had not <HI>England</HI> left the <HI>Greenwich,</HI> to &s;uccour his Con&s;ort; and had <HI>Kirby</HI> done the &s;ame, and brought his Ship into the Engagement, the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Men would have been a Match &s;ufficient for them; but Captain <HI>Kirby</HI> determined to take Care of one, and &s;o run away in a cowardly Manner.</P>
<P>Both the Pyrate Ships fell upon the <HI>Ca&s;&s;andra,</HI> whom &s;he fought for &s;ome Time, till finding her &s;elf over-powered, and being near the Shore, &s;he run in and grounded, and the Captain and all the Men e&s;caped to the I&s;land, and fled up into the Woods, not caring to tru&s;t them&s;elves in the Hands of tho&s;e, who are re&s;trained by no Laws, either hu|mane or divine.</P>
<P>The Pyrates took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Ship, and &s;oon after received a Me&s;&s;age from Captain <HI>Mack|ray,</HI> the Purport of which, was, to de&s;ire them to return his Ship to him, after they had plundered her of what they thought fit; which <HI>England</HI> was
<PB N="139" REF="146">
willing to do, but puting the Que&s;tion to a Vote, it pa&s;&s;ed in the Negative among them; however, they gave him their &s;malle&s;t Pyrate Ship, and 50 Bales of Cloath, and the Captain and his Men came &s;afe in her to <HI>Bombay.</HI></P>
<P>The Pyrates went into <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> and refited the <HI>Ca&s;&s;andra,</HI> which was pretty much torn in the Engagement, mounted 46 Guns aboard her, the <HI>Royal James</HI> having then 34; they &s;tayed here till the Beginning of the new Year 1721, and then put to Sea, &s;teering their Cour&s;e back to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> for the Gulph of <HI>Bengal.</HI> They came off our Company's principal Settlement, at the Time that three &s;tout Ships were ready for their Voyage to <HI>Europe;</HI> and crui&s;ing there &s;ome Time, block'd up the Harbour; till at length the <HI>India</HI> Men came to a Re&s;olution to fight the Pyrates, and accordingly &s;ailed out: The Pyrates received them, and a &s;mall Skirmi&s;h en&s;ued, but the <HI>India</HI> Ships, as &s;oon as they found they had got the Heels of the others, made tho&s;e as u&s;e|ful as they could to them, and very gallantly ran away from the Rovers.</P>
<P>From Fort St. <HI>George, England</HI> &s;tood along the Coa&s;t of <HI>Coromondel,</HI> and took two or three &s;mall Ships that were Trading from Port to Port, to make up the Lading for the <HI>European</HI> Ships. They ranged from Coa&s;t to Coa&s;t, from the <HI>Ganges</HI> to the Straits of <HI>Malaca,</HI> and met with &s;everal Ve&s;&s;els with Mu&s;lins, Silks, and &s;uch like Wares, which they plundered to a va&s;t Quantity, then vi&s;ited the Coa&s;t of <HI>Malabar,</HI> in their Way back, and re|turned to their Rendezvous at <HI>Madaga&s;car.</HI></P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved, that when the Captain and the Crew of the <HI>Ca&s;&s;andra,</HI> arrived at <HI>Bombay,</HI> Mr. <HI>Boone,</HI> the Governor there for the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Com|pany, di&s;patched an Expre&s;s home of the Pro|ceedings of the&s;e Pyrates, which procured four Men
<PB N="140" REF="147">
of War to be &s;ent after them, <HI>viz.</HI> two 60 Gun Ships, a 50 Gun Ship, and a 24 Gun Ship, which <HI>England</HI> had timely Notice of, by a &s;mall Ship that accidently put into <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> whil&s;t he was there.</P>
<P>In the Beginning of <HI>September,</HI> he left the I&s;land, but would not venture to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> again, but crui&s;ed up and down among the I&s;lands to the Ea&s;tward of <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> many hundred Leagues, and vi&s;ited &s;everal of them. At <HI>Ma&s;carenas,</HI> or, (as the <HI>French</HI> call it) <HI>Bourbon,</HI> he &s;aw a large Ship at Anchor in the Bay, upon which they &s;tood off all Day, and kept out of Sight. In the Evening, being well prepared for the Enterprize, they &s;tood into the Bay with a gentle Breeze of Wind, clapt the Ship aboard at once, and entered a hundred &s;tout Fellows, with a Cutla&s;h, and a brace of Pi|&s;toles each; and after a &s;hort Di&s;pute, wherein twenty or thirty Men were killed, &s;he became their Prize: They turned the Pri&s;oners down into the Hold, cut the Prizes Cables, and brought her out that Night to Sea. This proved to be an ex|traordinary Purcha&s;e to the Rovers, &s;he being a <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Man of War of 60 Guns, and had on Board, Seamen, Pa&s;&s;engers and Negroes, in all, to the Number of 1000 Men. She came from <HI>Goa</HI> with the <HI>Conde Ericeira,</HI> the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Vice-Roy of the <HI>Indies,</HI> removed from his Government, for &s;ome Male Admini&s;tration, and was then going to <HI>Bra&s;il,</HI> with all his Wealth, Servants and Attendants; as al&s;o the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Goa,</HI> but happen'd to be both a&s;hore when they &s;urpriz'd the Ship.</P>
<P>They did not judge it convenient to return to their old Rendezvous with the Prize, becau&s;e it was likely that the Men of War might call in there in their Way, which would not prove &s;o agreeable to them, therefore having Provi&s;ions and Water &s;ufficient, they &s;teered away for the
<PB N="141" REF="148">
Main of <HI>Africa,</HI> and arrived at a little Place, call'd <HI>Delagoa,</HI> near the River <HI>de Spiritu Sancto,</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Monomotapa,</HI> in about 26&deg; South Latitude. They came too in the Evening, and was &s;aluted from the Shore with a few Shot, which &s;urprized the Pyrates, not imagining any Fortification to be there; they anchored farther off for that Night, and perceiving in the Morning a &s;mall Fort of &s;ix Guns, they run up to it and battered it down.</P>
<P>This was a Settlement the <HI>Dutch</HI> had planted not many Months before, but never troubled them&s;elves about them afterwards, nor &s;ent them any Relief; there were 150 Men there at fir&s;t, but dwindled away by Sickne&s;s and Ca&s;ualties, &s;o that I judge that there's hardly any of them left at this Time: Sixteen of them petitioned to be taken a|board the Pyrates, which, with &s;ome Difficulty, was granted.</P>
<P>There was found in this Ship &s;o great a Trea|&s;ure, that it put the old Pyrates be&s;ide all Thoughts of pur&s;uing any more &s;uch like Adven|tures; which, added to their former Plunder, made a very great Sum together, and con&s;i&s;ted chiefly in rough Diamonds, hard Dollars, Gold Cro&s;&s;es, and other Trinkets; fine Mu&s;lins, Chint&s;es, and &s;uch Things, they e&s;teemed no more than Rags, or u&s;ele&s;s Lumber, be&s;towing a great Quantity upon the poor half-&s;tarved <HI>Dutch</HI> Men at this Place, who traffick'd with other Ships that put in there afterwards, for Provi&s;ions and Nece&s;&s;aries, at the Rate of about three Farthings a Yard <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>They could not all come to a Re&s;olution of quitting that Cour&s;e of Life, wherein they had met with &s;o much Succe&s;s, and therefore they came to an Agreement, that all tho&s;e who were for going home and making their Peace, &s;hould have the Liber|ty of doing it, and one of the Ships for that Pur|po&s;e; and tho&s;e that had a Mind to &s;tay behind,
<PB N="142" REF="149">
might remain in the other. Accordingly they put to Sea about <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> 1722, parted the Com|pany, and about 150, or more, came in the <HI>Ca&s;&s;andra,</HI> to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> they fell in Company with one of our Men of War, and anchored by her three Weeks, till they &s;ent a Me&s;&s;age to the Governor of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> to whom they offered to &s;urrender if they might have a Pardon for their Lives. The Governor &s;ent back an obliging An&s;wer, but told them, <HI>it was not in his Power to make Terms with them; that they &s;hould be very well received, and have their Li|berty in the I&s;land, till he had an An&s;wer from the Govern|ment of</HI> England. But this did not &s;atisfy them, they thought his Grace's Civility was no Security again&s;t the Letter of the Law; and therefore they weighed in a peaceable Manner, and &s;ailed directly to <HI>Porto Bello.</HI></P>
<P>There was then (as I was told) an Indemnity offer'd on the Part of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> to &s;uch Py|rates as &s;hould &s;urrender by a limited Time, where|of five Weeks, and no more, was yet to come, when they arrived at that Government; and, upon their Application, they were all receiv'd to Mercy.</P>
<P>Here they &s;at down to &s;pend the Fruits of their di&s;hone&s;t Indu&s;try, dividing the Spoil and Plunder of their Fellow-Creatures among them&s;elves, with|out the lea&s;t Compunction or Remor&s;e for what they had done; &s;atisfying their Con&s;ciences with this Salvo, that other People would have done the &s;ame Things, if they had had equal Courage, and the like Opportunities. And, I can't &s;ay, but that if they had known what was doing in <HI>England,</HI> at the &s;ame Time, by the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Directors, and other Per&s;ons, they would certainly have had this Reflection for their Con&s;olation, <HI>viz. That what|ever Murthers and Robberies they had committed, they were not the greate&s;t Villains that were then living in the World.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="150">
The Value that was put upon the Spoil at <HI>Porto Bello,</HI> was (if I am rightly inform'd) about three hundred thou&s;and Pound; a con&s;iderable Share of which (&s;ome &s;ay, a fourth Part) the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Gover|nor was complimented with; but, no doubt, had the Cargo been brought to a good Market, it would have produced a far greater Sum, there be|ing a va&s;t Quantity of Diamonds that came into their Hands in a Way of Dealing, by which they could make no tolerable Judgment of their Value. It is to be con&s;ider'd, that the other Part of the Crew which went off from them after they came out of <HI>Delago,</HI> divided with them, and carried away half the Wealth, which, if it had been brought all together into <HI>England,</HI> could not have amounted to le&s;s, at a moderate Computation, than a Mil|lion and half Sterling. But what was &s;quander'd away in the &s;ix Years of Action of this Crew, is incredible; al&s;o the Ravages and De&s;truction they con&s;tantly made of Merchandizes, which, tho' it &s;tood them in no Stead, was yet of Lo&s;s to the Owners, proportionable to their Price; all which we may very well &s;et down at a Million more. A great Sum indeed! and yet the Sum total will &s;hew, that the&s;e have been but puny Thieves, when com|pared to an equal Number within the Bills of Mor|tality.</P>
<P>What Cour&s;es the&s;e Fellows may take next, is uncertain, for they do not &s;eem re&s;olved to take up their Habitation there long; and &s;everal of them have already left the Country. I know of eight of them, that, upon Pretence of being ca&s;t away, ob|tain'd a Pa&s;&s;age in a trading Sloop to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> be|longing to the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Company; and one of them &s;hipp'd him&s;elf at that I&s;land for <HI>London,</HI> and arri|ved here not many Weeks ago; and others, no doubt, will trip home hereafter in the like Manner.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. OF Captain <HI>Howel Davis,</HI> And his CREW.</HEAD>
<P>CAptain <HI>Howel Davis</HI> was born at <HI>Milford,</HI> in <HI>Monmouth&s;hire,</HI> and was, from a Boy, brought up to the Sea.

<P>After the Death of Captain <HI>Skinner, Davis</HI> pre|tended that he was mightily &s;ollicited by <HI>England</HI> to engage with him; but that he re&s;olutely an|&s;wer'd, he would &s;ooner be &s;hot to Death than &s;ign the Pyrates Articles.

He al&s;o gave him a written Paper &s;ealed up, with Orders to open it when he &s;hould come into a certain Latitude,
<PB N="145" REF="152">
and at the Peril of his Life follow the Orders there|in &s;et down. This was an Air of Grandeur like what Princes Practice to their Admirals and Gene|rals.&mdash;It was punctually complied with by <HI>Davis,</HI> who read it to the Ship's Company; it contained no le&s;s than a generous Deed of Gift of the Ship and Cargoe, to <HI>Davis</HI> and the Crew, ordering him to go to <HI>Brazil</HI> and di&s;po&s;e of the I ading to the be&s;t Advantage, and to make a fair and equal Dividend with the re&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Davis</HI> propo&s;ed to the Crew, whether they were willing to follow their Directions, but to his great Surprize, found the Majority of them altogether aver&s;e to it, wherefore in a Rage, he bad them $Word$ damn'd, and go where they would. They kno$ that Part of their Cargoe was con&s;igned to $Word$ Merchants at <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> wherefore there $Span$ for that I&s;land. When they arrived, they $reated to the&s;e Merchants the unfortunate Death of <HI>Skin|ner,</HI> and the Propo&s;al which had been made to them by <HI>Davis;</HI> upon which, <HI>Davis</HI> was &s;eized and com|mitted to Pri&s;on, where he was kept three Months; however, as he had been in no Act of Pyracy, he was di&s;charged without being brought to any Tryal, yet he could not expect any Employment there; wherefore knowing that the I&s;land of <HI>Providence</HI> was a kind of Rendevouz of Pyrates, he was re&s;olved to make one among&s;t them, if po&s;&s;ible, and to that Purpo&s;e, found Means of &s;hipping him&s;elf for that I&s;land; but he was again di&s;appointed, for when he arrived there, the Pyrates had newly &s;urren|dered to Captain <HI>Woods Rogers,</HI> and accepted of the Act of Grace, which he had ju&s;t brought from <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>However, <HI>Davis</HI> was not long out of Bu&s;ine&s;s, for Captain <HI>Rogers</HI> having fitted out two Sloops for Trade, one called the <HI>Buck,</HI> the other the <HI>Mum|vil Trader; Davis</HI> found an Employment on Board
<PB N="146" REF="153">
of one of them; the Lading of the&s;e Sloops was of con&s;iderable Value, con&s;i&s;ting of <HI>European</HI> Goods, in order to be exchanged with the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and many of the Hands on Board of them, were the Pyrates lately come in upon the late Act of Grace. The fir&s;t Place they touched at, was the I&s;land of <HI>Martinico,</HI> belonging to the <HI>French,</HI> where <HI>Davis</HI> having con&s;pired with &s;ome others, ri&s;e in the Night, &s;ecured the Ma&s;ter and &s;eized the Sloop; as &s;oon as this was done, they called to the other Sloop, which lay a little Way from them, among whom they knew there were a great many Hands ripe for Rebellion, and ordered them to come on Board of them; they did &s;o, and the greate&s;t Part of them agreed to join with <HI>Davis;</HI> tho&s;e who were otherwi&s;e inclined, were &s;ent back on Board the <HI>Mumvil</HI> Sloop, to go where they plea&s;ed, <HI>Davis</HI> having fir&s;t taken out of her, every Thing which he thought might be of U&s;e.</P>
<P>After this, a Coun&s;el of War was called, over a large Bowl of Punch, at which it was propo&s;ed to chu&s;e a Commander; the Election was &s;oon over, for it fell upon <HI>Davis</HI> by a great Majority of <HI>legal Pollers,</HI> there was no Scrutiny demanded, for all acquie&s;ced in the Choice: As &s;oon as he was po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of his Command, he drew up Articles, which were &s;igned and &s;worn to by him&s;elf and the re&s;t, then he made a &s;hort Speech, the Sum of which, was, a Declaration of War again&s;t the whole World.</P>
<P>After this they con&s;ulted about a proper Place where they might clean their Sloop, a light Pair of Heels being of great U&s;e either to take, or e&s;|cape being taken; for this Purpo&s;e they made Choice of <HI>Coxon</HI>'s <HI>H$le,</HI> at the Ea&s;t End of the I&s;land of <HI>Cuba,</HI> a Place where they might &s;ecure them&s;elves from Surprize, the Entrance being &s;o narrow, that one Ship might keep out a hundred.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="154">
Here they cleaned with much Difficulty, for they had no Carpenter in their Company, a Per&s;on of great U&s;e upon &s;uch Exigencies; from hence they put to Sea, making to the North-Side of the I&s;land of <HI>Hi&s;paniola.</HI> The fir&s;t Sail which fell in their Way, was a <HI>French</HI> Ship of twelve Guns; It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that <HI>Davis</HI> had but thirty five Hands, yet Provi&s;ions began to grow &s;hort with him; wherefore he attacked this Ship, &s;he &s;oon &s;truck, and he &s;ent twelve of his Hands on Board of her, in order to plunder: This was no &s;ooner done, but a Sail was &s;pied a great Way to Windward of them; they enquired of the <HI>French-</HI>Man what &s;he might be, he an&s;wered, that he had &s;poke with a Ship, the Day before, of twenty four Guns and &s;ixty Men, and he took this to be the &s;ame.</P>
<P><HI>Davis</HI> then propo&s;ed to his Men to attack her, telling them, &s;he would be a rare Ship for their U&s;e, but they looked upon it to be an extravagant Attempt, and di&s;covered no Fondne&s;s for it, but he a&s;&s;ured them he had a Stratagem in his Head would make all &s;afe; wherefore he gave Chace, and ordered his Prize to do the &s;ame. The Prize being a &s;low Sailor, <HI>Davis</HI> fir&s;t came up with the Enemy, and &s;tanding along Side of them, &s;hew'd his pyratical Colours: They, much &s;urprized, call'd to <HI>Davis,</HI> telling him, they wondered at his Im|pudence in venturing to come &s;o near them, and ordered him to &s;trike; but he an&s;wered, that he in|tended to keep them in play, till his Con&s;ort came up, who was able to deal with them, and that if they did not &s;trike to him, they &s;hould have but bad Quarters; whereupon he gave them a Broad-Side, which they returned.</P>
<P>In the mean Time the Prize drew near, who obliged all the Pri&s;oners to come upon Deck in white Shirts, to make a Shew of Force, as they had been directed by <HI>Davis;</HI> they al&s;o hoi&s;ted a dirty
<PB N="148" REF="155">
Tarpawlin, by Way of black Flag, they having no other, and fired a Gun: The <HI>French</HI> Men were &s;o intimidated by this Appearance of Force, that they &s;truck. <HI>Davis</HI> called out to the Captain to come on Board of him, with twenty of his Hands; he did &s;o, and they were all for the greater Security clapt into Irons, the Captain excepted: Then he &s;ent four of his own Men on Board the fir&s;t Prize, and in order &s;till to carry on the Cheat, &s;poke aloud, that they &s;hould give his Service to the Captain, and de&s;ire him to &s;end &s;ome Hands on Board the Prize, to &s;ee what they had got; but at the &s;ame Time gave them a written Paper, with In&s;tructions what to do. Here he ordered them to nail up the Guns in the little Prize, to take out all the &s;mall Arms and Powder, and to go every Man of them on Board the &s;econd Prize; when this was done, he ordered that more of the Pri&s;oners &s;hould be removed out of the great Prize, into the little one, by which he &s;ecured him&s;elf from any At|tempt which might be feared from their Numbers; for tho&s;e on Board of him were fa&s;t in Irons, and tho&s;e in the little Prize had neither Arms nor Am|munition.</P>
<P>Thus the three Ships kept Company for two Days, when finding the great Prize to be a very dull Sai|lor, he thought &s;he would not be fit for his Pur|po&s;e, wherefore he re&s;olved to re&s;tore her to the Captain, with all his Hands; but fir&s;t, he took Care to take out all her Ammunition, and every Thing el&s;e which he might po&s;&s;ibly want. The <HI>French</HI> Captain was in &s;uch a Rage, at being &s;o out|witted, that when he got on Board his own Ship, he was going to throw him&s;elf over-board, but was prevented by his Men.</P>
<P>Having let go both his Prizes, he &s;teered North|ward, in which Cour&s;e he took a &s;mall <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Sloop; after this, he made towards the <HI>We&s;tern</HI> I&s;lands,
<PB N="149" REF="156">
but met with no Booty thereabouts; then he &s;teered for the <HI>Cape de Verde</HI> I&s;lands, they ca&s;t An|chor at St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> hoi&s;ting <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colours; the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> inhabiting there, took him for an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Privateer, and <HI>Davis</HI> going a&s;hore, they both treat|ed him very civilly, and al&s;o traded with him. Here he remained five Weeks, in which Time, he and half his Crew, for their Plea&s;ure, took a Jour|ney to the chief Town of the I&s;land, which was nineteen Miles up the Country: <HI>Davis</HI> making a good Appearance, was care&s;&s;ed by the Governor and the Inhabitants, and no Diver&s;ion was wanting which the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> could Shew, or Money could Purcha&s;e; after about a Weeks Stay, he came back to the Ship, and the re&s;t of the Crew went to take their Plea&s;ure up to the Town, in their Turn.</P>
<P>At their Return they clean'd their Ship, and put to Sea, but not with their whole Company; for five of them, like <HI>Hannibal</HI>'s Men, were &s;o charm'd with the Luxuries of the Place, and the free Con|ver&s;ation of &s;ome Women, that they &s;taid behind; and one of them, who&s;e Name was <HI>Charles Franklin,</HI> a <HI>Monmouth&s;hire</HI> Man, married and &s;ettled him&s;elf, and lives there to this Day.</P>
<P>From hence they &s;ailed to <HI>Bonevi&s;ta,</HI> and looked into that Harbour, but finding nothing, they &s;teer'd for the I&s;le of <HI>May:</HI> When they arrived here, they met with a great many Ships and Ve&s;&s;els in the Road, all which they plunder'd, taking out of them whatever they wanted; and al&s;o &s;trengthen'd them|&s;elves with a great many fre&s;h Hands, who mo&s;t of them enter'd voluntarily. One of the Ships they took to their own U&s;e, mounted her with twenty &s;ix Guns, and call'd her the <HI>King James.</HI> There be|ing no fre&s;h Water hereabouts, they made towards St. <HI>Jago,</HI> belonging to the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> in order to lay in a Store; <HI>Davis,</HI> with a few Hands, going a&s;hore to find the mo&s;t commodious Place to water at, the

Governor, with &s;ome Attendants, came him&s;elf and examined who they were, and whence they came? and not liking <HI>Davis</HI>'s Account of him&s;elf, the Gover|nor was &s;o plain to tell them, he &s;u&s;pected them to be Pyrates. <HI>Davis</HI> &s;eem'd mightily affronted, &s;tan|ding much upon his Honour, replying to the Gover|nor he &s;corn'd his Words; however, as &s;oon as his Back was turn'd, for fear of Accidents, he got on Board again as fa&s;t as he could. <HI>Davis</HI> related what had happen'd, and his Men &s;eem'd to re&s;ent the Af|front which had been offer'd him. <HI>Davis,</HI> upon this, told them, he was confident he could &s;urprize the Fort in the Night; they agreed with him to attempt it, and accordingly, when it grew late, they went a&s;hore well arm'd; and the Guard which was kept, was &s;o negligent, that they got within the Fort before any Alarm was given: When it was too late there was &s;ome little Re&s;i&s;tance made, and three Men kill'd on <HI>Davis</HI>'s Side. Tho&s;e in the Fort, in their Hur|ry, run into the Governor's Hou&s;e to &s;ave them|&s;elves, which they barricaded &s;o &s;trongly, that <HI>Da|vis</HI>'s Party could not enter it; however, they threw in Granadoe-Shells, which not only ruin'd all the Furniture, but kill'd &s;everal Men within.</P>
<P>When it was Day the whole Country was alarm'd, and came to attack the Pyrates; wherefore it not being their Bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;tand a Siege, they made the be&s;t of their Way on Board their Ship again, after having di&s;mounted the Guns of the Fort. By this Enterprize they did a great Deal of Mi&s;chief to the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> and but very little Good to them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>Having put to Sea they mu&s;ter'd their Hands, and found them&s;elves near &s;eventy &s;trong; then it was propo&s;ed what Cour&s;e they &s;hould &s;teer, and differing in their Opinions, they divided, and by a Majority it was carried for <HI>Gambia</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Gu$ney;</HI> of this Opinion was <HI>Davis,</HI> he having been
<PB N="151" REF="158">
employ'd in that Trade, was acquainted with the Coa&s;t: He told them, that there was a great Deal of Money always kept in <HI>Gambia</HI> Ca&s;tle, and that it would be worth their while to make an Attempt upon it. They ask'd him how it was po&s;&s;ible, &s;ince it was garri&s;on'd? He de&s;ir'd they would leave the Management of it to him, and he would undertake to make them Ma&s;ters of it. They began now to conceive &s;o high an Opinion of his Conduct, as well as Courage, that they thought nothing impo&s;&s;ible to him, therefore they agreed to obey him, without enquiring further into his De&s;ign.</P>
<P>Having come within Sight of the Place, he or|der'd all his Men under Deck, except as many as were ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for working the Ship, that tho&s;e from the Fort &s;eeing a Ship with &s;o few Hands, might have no Su&s;picion of her being any other than a trading Ve&s;&s;el; then he ran clo&s;e un|der the Fort, and there ca&s;t Anchor, and having ordered out the Boat, he commanded &s;ix Men in her, in old ordinary Jackets, while he him&s;elf, with the Ma&s;ter and Doctor, dre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves like Gentlemen; his De&s;ign being, that the Men &s;hould look like common Sailors, and they like Merchants. In rowing a&s;hore he gave his Men In&s;tructions what to &s;ay in Ca&s;e any Que&s;tions &s;hould be ask|ed them.</P>
<P>Being come to the landing Place, he was recei|ved by a File of Mu&s;queteers, and conducted into the Fort, where the Governor acco&s;ting them civil|ly, ask'd them who they were, and whence they came? They an&s;wered they were of <HI>Liverpool,</HI> bound for the River of <HI>Sinnegal,</HI> to trade for Gum and Elephant's Teeth, but that they were chaced on that Coa&s;t by two <HI>French</HI> Men of War, and nar|rowly e&s;caped being taken, having a little the Heels of them; but now they were re&s;olved to make the be&s;t of a bad Market, and would Trade

here for Slaves; then the Governor ask'd them, what was the Chief of their Cargoe? They an&s;wer|ed, Iron and Plate, which were good Things there; The Governor told them he would Slave them to the full Value of their Cargoe, and ask'd them, if they had any <HI>European</HI> Liquor on Board? they an&s;wered, a little for their own U&s;e; how|ever, a Hamper &s;hould be at his Service. The Go|vernor then very civilly invited them all to &s;tay and dine with him; <HI>Davis</HI> told him, that being Commander of the Ship, he mu&s;t go on Board to &s;ee her well moored, and give &s;ome other Orders, but tho&s;e two Gentlemen might &s;tay, and that he him&s;elf would al&s;o return before Dinner, and bring the Hamper of Liquor with him.</P>
<P>While he was in the Fort, his Eyes were very bu&s;y in ob&s;erving how Things lay; he took Notice there was a Sentry at the Entrance, and a Guard-Hou&s;e ju&s;t by it, where the Soldiers upon Duty commonly waited, their Arms &s;tanding in a Cor|ner, in a Heap; he &s;aw al&s;o a great many &s;mall Arms in the Governor's Hall; now when he came on Board, he a&s;&s;ured his Men of Succe&s;s, de&s;iring them not to get drunk, and that as &s;oon as they &s;aw the Flag upon the Ca&s;tle &s;truck, they might conclude he was Ma&s;ter, and &s;end twenty Hands immediately a&s;hore; in the mean Time, there being a Sloop at Anchor near them, he &s;ent &s;ome Hands in a Boat, to &s;ecure the Ma&s;ter and all the Men, and bring them on Board of him, lea&s;t they ob&s;erving any Bu&s;tle, or arming in his Ship, might &s;end a&s;hore and give Intelligence.</P>
<P>The&s;e Precautions being taken, he ordered his Men, who were to go in the Boat with him, to put two Pair of Pi&s;tols each under their Cloaths, he doing the like him&s;elf, and gave them Directions to go into the Guard-Room, and to enter into Conver&s;ation with the Soldiers, and ob&s;erve when

he &s;hould fire a Pi&s;tol thro' the Governor's Win|dow, to &s;tart up at once and &s;ecure the Arms in the Guard-Room.</P>
<P>When <HI>Davis</HI> arrived, Dinner not being ready, the Governor propo&s;ed that they &s;hould pa&s;s their Time in making a Bowl of Punch till Dinner-Time: It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that <HI>Davis</HI>'s Coxon waited upon them, who had an Opportunity of going about all Parts of the Hou&s;e, to &s;ee what Strength they had, he whi&s;pered <HI>Davis,</HI> there being no Per&s;on then in the Room, but he <HI>(Davis)</HI> the Ma|&s;ter, the Doctor, the Coxon, and Governor; <HI>Davis</HI> on a &s;udden drew out a Pi&s;tol, clapt it to the Go|vernor's Brea&s;t, telling him he mu&s;t Surrender the Fort and all the Riches in it, or he was a dead Man. The Governor being no Ways prepared for &s;uch an Attack, promi&s;ed to be very Pa&s;&s;ive, and do all they de&s;ired, wherefore they &s;hut the Door, took down all the Arms that hung in the Hall, and loaded them. <HI>Davis</HI> fires his Pi&s;tol thro' the Window, upon which his Men without, executed their Part of the Scheme, like Heroes, in an in&s;tant; getting betwixt the Soldiers and their Arms, all with their Pi&s;tols cock'd in their Hands, while one of them carried the Arms out. When this was done, they locked the Soldiers into the Guard-Room, and kept Guard without.</P>
<P>In the mean Time one of them &s;truck the Union Flag on the Top of the Ca&s;tle, at which Signal tho&s;e on Board &s;ent on Shore a Reinforcement of Hands, and they got Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Fort with|out the lea&s;t Hurry or Confu&s;ion, or &s;o much as a Man lo&s;t of either Side.</P>
<P><HI>Davis</HI> harangued the Soldiers, upon which a great many of them took on with him, tho&s;e who refu&s;ed, he &s;ent on Board the little Sloop, and becau&s;e he would not be at the trouble of a Guard for them, he ordered all the Sails and Cables

out of her, which might hinder them from attempt|ing to get away.</P>
<P>This Day was &s;pent in a kind of Rejoycing, the Ca&s;tle firing her Guns to &s;alute the Ship, and the Ship the Ca&s;tle; but the next Day they minded their Bu&s;ine&s;s, that is, they fell to plundering, but they found Things fall va&s;tly &s;hort of their Ex|pectation; for they di&s;cover'd, that a great deal of Money had been lately &s;ent away; however, they met with the Value of about two thou&s;and Pounds Sterling in Bar Gold, and a great many other rich Effects: Every Thing they liked, which was por|table, they brought aboard their Ship; &s;ome Things which they had no U&s;e for, they were &s;o generous to make a Pre&s;ent of, to the Ma&s;ter and Crew of the little Sloop, to whom they al&s;o returned his Ve&s;&s;el again, and then they fell to work in di&s;mounting the Guns, and demoli&s;hing the Fortifications.</P>
<P>After they had done as much Mi&s;chief as they could, and were weighing Anchor to be gone, they &s;py'd a Ship bearing down upon them in full Sail; they &s;oon got their Anchors up, and were in a Readine&s;s to receive her. This Ship prov'd to be a <HI>French</HI> Pyrate of fourteen Guns, and &s;ixty four Hands, half <HI>French,</HI> half Negroes; the Captain's Name was <HI>La Bou&s;e;</HI> he expected no le&s;s than a rich Prize, which made him &s;o eager in the Chace; but when he came near enough to &s;ee their Guns, and the Number of their Hands upon Deck, he began to think he &s;hould catch a <HI>Tartar,</HI> and &s;uppo&s;ed her to be a &s;mall <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man of War; however, &s;ince there was no e&s;caping, he re&s;olv'd to do a bold and de&s;perate Action, which was to board <HI>Davis.</HI> As he was making towards her for this Purpo&s;e, he fir'd a Gun, and hoi&s;ted his black Colours; <HI>Davis</HI> re|turn'd the Salute, and hoi&s;ted his black Colours al&s;o. The <HI>Frenchman</HI> was not a little pleas'd at this happy Mi&s;take; they both hoi&s;ted out their Boats,
<PB N="155" REF="162">
and the Captains went to meet and congratulate one another with a Flag of Truce in their Sterns; a great many Civilities pa&s;&s;ed between them, and <HI>La Bou&s;e</HI> de&s;ired <HI>Davis,</HI> that they might &s;ail down the Coa&s;t together, that he <HI>(La Bou&s;e)</HI> might get a better Ship: <HI>Davis</HI> agreed to it, and very cour|teou&s;ly promi&s;ed him the fir&s;t Ship he took, fit for their U&s;e, he would give him, as being willing to encourage a younger Brother.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Place they touch'd at, was <HI>Sierraleone,</HI> where at fir&s;t going in, they &s;pied a tall Ship at Anchor; <HI>Davis</HI> being the be&s;t Sailor fir&s;t came up with her, and wondering that &s;he did not try to make off, &s;u&s;pected her to be a Ship of Force. As &s;oon as he came along Side of her, &s;he brought a Spring upon her Cable, and fired a whole Broad-&s;ide upon <HI>Davis,</HI> at the &s;ame Time hoi&s;ting a black Flag; <HI>Davis</HI> hoi&s;ted his black Flag in like Manner, and fired one Gun to Leeward.</P>
<P>In fine, &s;he proved to be a Pyrate Ship of twenty four Guns, commanded by one <HI>Cocklyn,</HI> who expect|ing the&s;e two would prove Prizes, let them come in, lea&s;t his getting under Sail might frighten them away.</P>
<P>The Satisfaction was great on all Sides, at this Junction of Confederates and Brethren in Iniquity; two Days they &s;pent in improving their Acquain-and Friend&s;hip, the third Day <HI>Davis</HI> and <HI>Cocklin,</HI> agreed to go in <HI>La Bou&s;e</HI>'s Brigantine, and attack the Fort, they contrived it &s;o, as to get up thither by high Water; tho&s;e in the Fort &s;u&s;pected them to be what they really were, and therefore &s;tood upon their Defence; when the Brigantine came within Musket-Shot, the Fort fired all their Guns upon her, the Brigantine did the like upon the Fort, and &s;o held each other in Play, for &s;everal Hours, when the two confederate Ships were come up to the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Brigantine; tho&s;e who

defended the Fort, &s;eeing &s;uch a Number of Hands on Board the&s;e Ships, had not the Courage to &s;tand it any longer, but abandoning the Fort, left it to the Mercy of the Pyrates.</P>
<P>They took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and continued there near &s;even Weeks, in which Time they all cleaned their Ships; we &s;hould have ob&s;erved that a Galley came into the Road while they were there, which <HI>Davis</HI> in&s;i&s;ted &s;hould be yeilded to <HI>La Bou&s;e,</HI> accor|ding to his Word of Honour before given; <HI>Cock|lin</HI> did not oppo&s;e it, &s;o <HI>La Bou&s;e</HI> went into her, with his Crew, and cutting away her half Deck, mounted her with twenty four Guns.</P>
<P>Having called a Coun&s;el of War, they agreed to &s;ail down the Coa&s;t together, and for the greater Grandeur, appointed a Commadore, which was <HI>Davis;</HI> but they had not kept Company long, when drinking together on Board of <HI>Davis,</HI> they had like to have fallen together by the Ears, the &s;trong Liquor &s;tired up a Spirit of Di&s;cord among them, and they quarrelled, but <HI>Davis</HI> put an End to it by this &s;hort Speech:<HI>&mdash;Hearkee you</HI> Cock|lin, <HI>and</HI> La Bou&s;e, <HI>I find by &s;trength'ning you, I have put a Red into your Hands to whip my &s;elf, but I'm &s;till able to deal with you both; but &s;ince we met in Love, let us part in Love, for I find that three of a Trade can never agree.&mdash;</HI>Upon which the other two went on Board their re&s;pective Ships, and immediately parted, each &s;teering a different Cour&s;e.</P>

very hot Engagement followed, which la&s;ted from one a Clock at Noon, till nine next Morning, when the <HI>Dutch</HI> Man &s;truck, and yeilded her &s;elf their Prize.</P>
<P><HI>Davis</HI> fitted up the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship for his own U&s;e, and called her the <HI>Rover,</HI> aboard of which he mounted thirty two Guns, and twenty &s;even Swi|vels, and proceeded with her and the <HI>King James,</HI> to <HI>Anamboe;</HI> he enter'd the Bay betwixt the Hours of twelve and one at Noon, and found there three Ships lying at Anchor, who were trading for Ne|groes, Gold and Teeth: The Names of the&s;e Ships were the <HI>Hind</HI> Pink, Captain <HI>Hall</HI> Commander, the <HI>Prince&s;s,</HI> Captain <HI>Plumb,</HI> of which <HI>Roberts,</HI> who will make a con&s;iderable Figure in the &s;equel of this Hi&s;tory, was &s;econd Mate, and the <HI>Morrice</HI> Sloop, Captain <HI>Fin;</HI> he takes the&s;e Ships without any Re|&s;i&s;tance, and having plundered them, he makes a Pre&s;ent of one of them, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Morrice</HI> Sloop, to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Men, on Board of which alone were found a hundred and forty Negroes, be&s;ides dry Goods, and a con&s;iderable Quantity of Gold-Du&s;t.</P>
<P>It happened there were &s;everal Canoes along Side of this la&s;t, when <HI>Davis</HI> came in, who &s;aved them|&s;elves and got a&s;hore; the&s;e gave Notice at the Fort, that the&s;e Ships were Pyrates, upon which, the Fort fired upon them, but without any Exe|cution, for their Mettle was not of Weight enough to reach them; <HI>Davis</HI> therefore, by Way of Defiance, hoi&s;ted his black Flag, and returned their Com|pliment.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Day he &s;ailed with his three Ships, making his Way down the Coa&s;t; at Night he lay by, with his Head to the Offin, and early in the Morn|ing the Man at the Ma&s;t-Head &s;pied a Sail. It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved they keep a good Look-out; for, according to their Articles, he who fir&s;t &s;pies a Sail, if &s;he proves a Prize, is intitled to the be&s;t

Pair of Pi&s;tols on Board, over and above his Divi|dend, in which they take &s;ingular Pride; and a Pair of Pi&s;tols has &s;ometimes been &s;old for thirty Pounds, from one to another.</P>
<P>Immediately they gave Chace, and &s;oon came up with her; the Ship proved to be a <HI>Hollander,</HI> and being betwixt <HI>Davis</HI> and the Shore, &s;he made all the Sail &s;he could, intending to run aground; <HI>Davis</HI> gue&s;&s;ed her De&s;ign, and putting out all his &s;mall Sails, came up with her before &s;he could effect it, and fired a Broad-&s;ide upon her, upon which &s;he immediately &s;truck, and called for Quarter. It was granted, for according to <HI>Davis</HI>'s Articles it was a|greed that Quarter &s;hould be given, when ever it was called for, upon Pain of Death.</P>
<P>This Ship proved a very rich Prize, having the Governor of <HI>Acra</HI> on Board, with all his Effects, go|ing to <HI>Holland;</HI> there was in Money to the Value of 15000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling, be&s;ides other valuable Merchan|dizes, all which they brought on Board of them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Upon this new Succe&s;s, they re&s;tored Captain <HI>Hall</HI> and Captain <HI>Plumb</HI> before mentioned, their Ships again, but &s;trengthened their Company with thirty five Hands, all white Men, taken out of the&s;e two and the <HI>Morrice</HI> Sloop; they al&s;o re&s;tored the <HI>Dutch</HI> their Ship, after having plunder'd her as is mention'd.</P>
<P>The next Cour&s;e they &s;teered, was towards the I&s;land of <HI>Princes;</HI> before they got thither, one of their Ships, <HI>viz.</HI> that call'd the <HI>King James,</HI> &s;prung a Leak; <HI>Davis</HI> ordered all Hands out of her, on Board his own Ship, with every Thing el&s;e of U&s;e, and left her at an Anchor at high <HI>Cameroon.</HI> As &s;oon as he came in Sight of the I&s;land of <HI>Princes,</HI> he hoi&s;ted <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colours; the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> ob&s;erving a large Ship &s;ail|ing towards them, &s;ent out a little Sloop to examine what &s;he might be; this Sloop hailing of <HI>Davis,</HI> he told them he was an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man of War, in que&s;t of Pyrates, and that he had received Intelligence

there were &s;ome upon that Coa&s;t; upon this they received him as a welcome Gue&s;t, and piloted him into the Harbour. He &s;aluted the Fort, which they an&s;wered, and he came to an Anchor ju&s;t under their Guns, and hoi&s;ted out the Pinnace Man of War Fa&s;hion, ordering nine Hands and a Coxon in it, to row him a&s;hore.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> to do him the greater Honour, &s;ent down a File of Mu&s;queteers to receive him, and conduct him to the Governor. The Governor not in the lea&s;t &s;u&s;pecting what he was, received him very civilly, promi&s;ing to &s;upply him with whatever the I&s;land afforded; <HI>Davis</HI> thanked him, telling him, the King of <HI>England</HI> would pay for what|ever he &s;hould take; &s;o after &s;everal Civilities pa&s;s'd between him and the Governor, he returned again on Board.</P>
<P>It happened a <HI>French</HI> Ship came in there to &s;upply it &s;elf with &s;ome Nece&s;&s;aries, which <HI>Davis</HI> took in|to his Head to plunder, but to give the Thing a Colour of Right, he per&s;uaded the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> that &s;he had been trading with the Pyrates, and that he found &s;everal Pyrate's Goods on Board, which he &s;eized for the King's U&s;e: This Story pa&s;&s;ed &s;o well upon the Governor, that he commended <HI>Davis</HI>'s Diligence.</P>
<P>A few Days after, <HI>Davis</HI> with about fourteen more, went privately a&s;hore, and walk'd up the Country towards a Village, where the Governor and the other chief Men of the I&s;land kept their Wives, in|tending, as we may &s;uppo&s;e, to &s;upply their Hus|band's Places with them; but being di&s;covered, the Women fled to a neighbouring Wood, and <HI>Davis</HI> and the re&s;t retreated to their Ship, without effecting their De&s;ign: The Thing made &s;ome Noi&s;e, but as No-body knew them, it pa&s;&s;ed over.</P>
<P>Having cleaned his Ship, and put all Things in Order, his Thoughts now were turned upon the
<PB N="160" REF="167">
main Bu&s;ine&s;s, <HI>viz.</HI> the Plunder of the I&s;land, and not knowing where the Trea&s;ure lay, a Stratagem came into his Head, to get it (as he thought) with little Trouble; he con&s;ulted his Men upon it, and they liked the De&s;ign: His Scheme was, to make a Pre&s;ent to the Governor, of a dozen Negroes, by Way of Return for the Civilities received from him, and afterwards to invite him, with the chief Men, and &s;ome of the Friers, on Board his Ship to an En|tertainment; the Minute they came on Board, they were to be &s;ecured in Irons, and there kept till they &s;hould pay a Ran&s;om of 40000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling.</P>
<P>But this Stratagem proved fatal to him, for a <HI>Por|tugue&s;e</HI> Negroe &s;wam a&s;hore in the Night, and di&s;co|vered the whole Plot to the Governor, and al&s;o let him know, that it was <HI>Davis</HI> who had made the At|tempt upon their Wives. However, the Governor di&s;&s;embled, received the Pyrate's Invitation civily, and promi&s;ed that he and the re&s;t would go.</P>
<P>The next Day <HI>Davis</HI> went on Shore him&s;elf, as if it were out of greater Re&s;pect to bring the Gover|nor on Board: He was received with the u&s;ual Ci|vility, and he and his Officers de&s;ired to walk up to the Governor's Hou&s;e, to take &s;ome Refre&s;hment before they went on Board; they accepted it with|out the lea&s;t Su&s;picion, but never returned again; for an Ambu&s;cade was laid for them, a Signal being given, a whole Volley was fired upon them; they every Man drop'd, except one, this one fled back and e&s;caped into the Boat, and got on Board the Ship: <HI>Davis</HI> was &s;hot through the Bowels, yet he ri&s;e again, and made a weak Effort to get away, but his Strength &s;oon for &s;ook him, and he drop'd down dead; ju&s;t as he fell, he perceived he was followed, and drawing out his Pi&s;tols, fired them at his Pur&s;uers: Thus like a game Cock, giving a dy|ing Blow, that he might not fall unrevenged.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. OF Captain <HI>Bartho. Roberts.</HI> And his CREW.</HEAD>
<P><HI>DAvis</HI> being cut off, in the manner before mentioned, the Company was under a Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of filling up his Po&s;t, and <HI>Roberts</HI> had behaved &s;o well before this Accident, (tho' he had not been above &s;ix Weeks among them,) that he was by a great Majority elected Captain; and he would often after this, &s;ay in excu&s;e of it, <HI>That &s;ince he had dipped his Hands in muddy Water, and mu&s;t be a Pyrate, it was better being a Commander than a common Man.</HI></P>
<P>His fir&s;t Indignation &s;hew'd it &s;elf again&s;t tho&s;e I&s;landers, in Revenge for Captain <HI>Davis</HI>'s Death, who being well beloved by the Company, he thought he could do nothing more grateful to them, than to puni&s;h the Authors of it, and which would at the &s;ame Time po&s;&s;e&s;s them with an Opinion of his own Courage: Whereupon he im|mediately landed a Party of about thirty Men, to make an Attack upon the Fort. This had been a dangerous Enterprize, had it been garri&s;oned by any other People than <HI>Portugue&s;e;</HI> for the Fort &s;tood upon a Rock, clo&s;e to the Water-Side,
<PB N="162" REF="169">
which mu&s;t be a&s;cended to by a &s;teep Hill, again&s;t the Mouth of the Cannon. <HI>Roberts</HI> and his Men were no wit daunted, having conceived the utmo&s;t Contempt of the Courage of that Nation, and therefore march'd boldly up to the Fort, and found him&s;elf not mi&s;taken; for as &s;oon as the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> had di&s;cerned their Enemy, they di&s;|charged the Guns that were loaded, and for&s;ook their Po&s;t, and the Pyrates marched in without further Oppo&s;ition. The Fort being abandoned, there was nothing more to do, but to Nail up the Cannon, and throw them over the Wall into the Sea, which after they had done, they retrea|ted to their Ship, without any Lo&s;s.</P>
<P>But this was not look'd upon as a &s;ufficient Sa|tisfaction for the Injury they received, therefore mo&s;t of the Company were for burning the Town, which <HI>Roberts</HI> &s;aid he would yield to, if any means could be propo&s;ed of doing it without their own De&s;truction, for the Town had a &s;ecurer Scituation than the Fort, a thick Wood coming almo&s;t clo&s;e to it, affording Cover to the Defendants, who under &s;uch an Advantage, he told them, it was to be fear'd, would fire and &s;tand better to their Arms; be&s;ides, that bare Hou&s;es would be but a &s;lender Reward for their Trouble and Lo&s;s. This prudent Advice prevailed, and they contented them&s;elves with bringing a Spring on their Cable, and ta|king leave with a few Balls, which did no great Damage.</P>
<P>The next Day they weighed, and went to Sea, and then put it to the Vote, what Voyage they &s;hould take, which they unanimou&s;ly concurr'd in, &s;hould be to try their Fortunes on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Bra&s;il.</HI> They made the be&s;t of their Way thither, and nothing remarkable happening in the Voyage, I &s;hall take no Notice of them till their Arrival off of <HI>Bahia,</HI> the riche&s;t
<PB N="163" REF="170">
and mo&s;t populous Place of all the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Co|lonies, and where the greate&s;t Trade is carried on.</P>
<P>The Rovers came off the Bay betimes in the Morning, and fell in with a Fleet of 40 Sail of <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Ships, with all their Lading for <HI>Lisbon,</HI> who lay too, waiting for their Convoy; which were two Men of War of 70 Guns each, be&s;ides &s;everal of the Merchant Ships were of good Force. However, <HI>Roberts</HI> thought it &s;hould go hard with him, but he would make up his Market among them, and thereupon mix'd with the Fleet, and kept his Men hid till proper Re&s;olutions could be formed; that done, they came clo&s;e up to one of them, and ordered her to &s;end the Ma&s;ter on Board quietly, threatning to give them no Quarters, if any Re&s;i&s;tance, or Signal of Di&s;tre&s;s, was made. The <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> being &s;urprized at the&s;e Threats, and the &s;udden Flouri&s;h of Cut|la&s;hes from the Pyrates, &s;ubmitted without a Word, and the Captain came on Board; <HI>Roberts</HI> &s;aluted him after a friendly manner, telling him, that they were Gentlemen of Fortune, but that their Bu&s;ine&s;s with him, was only to be informed which was the riche&s;t Ship in that Fleet; and if he directed them right, he &s;hould be re&s;tored to his Ship without Mole&s;tation, otherwi&s;e, he mu&s;t expect nothing but immediate Death.</P>
<P>Whereupon this <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Ma&s;ter pointed to one of 40 Guns, and 150 Men, wearing a Vice-Admiral's Flag, which was of far greater Force than <HI>Robert</HI>'s Ship, but this no Ways di&s;mayed them, <HI>they were</HI> Portugue&s;e, they &s;aid, and &s;o imme|diately &s;teered away for him. When they came within Hail, the Ma&s;ter whom they had Pri&s;oner, was ordered to ask, <HI>how Seignior Capitain did?</HI> And to invite him on Board, for that he had a Matter of Con&s;equence to impart to him, which being done, he returned for An&s;wer, <HI>That he would wait upon him</HI>
<PB N="164" REF="171">
<HI>Pre&s;ently:</HI> But the Bu&s;tle that immediately followed, and which the Pyrates perceived, gave them Su&s;pi|cion, that they were di&s;covered, and this only a deceitful An&s;wer to gain Time to put their Ship in a Po&s;ture of Defence; &s;o without further Delay, they poured in a Broad-Side, boarded and grapled her; the Di&s;pute was &s;hort and warm, wherein many of the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> fell, and two only of the Pyrates. By this Time the Fleet was a|larmed, Signals of Top-gallant Sheets flying, and Guns fired, to give Notice to the Men of War, who rid &s;till at an Anchor, but now ha&s;tened out to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance; and if what the Pyrates them&s;elves related, be true, the Commanders of tho&s;e Ships were blamable to the highe&s;t Degree, and unworthy the Name of Men: For <HI>Roberts</HI> finding the Prize to &s;ail heavy, and was yet re&s;olved not to loo&s;e her, lay by for the head|mo&s;t of them (which much out &s;ail'd the other) and prepared for Battle, which was ignominiou&s;ly declined, tho' of &s;uch &s;uperior Force; for not da|ring to venture on the Pyrate alone, he tarried &s;o long for his Con&s;or as gave them time lei&s;urely to make off with the Prize.</P>
<P>They found this Ship exceeding rich, being la|den chiefly with Sugar, Skins, and Tobacco, and in Gold 90000 Moidors, be&s;ides Chains and Trin|ckets, of con&s;iderable Value; particularly a Cro&s;s &s;et with Diamonds, de&s;igned for the King of <HI>Por|tugal;</HI> which they afterwards pre&s;ented to the Governor of <HI>Caiana,</HI> by whom they were obliged.</P>
<P>Elated with this Booty, they had nothing now to think of but &s;ome &s;afe Retreat, where they might give them&s;elves up to all the Plea&s;ures that Luxury and Wantonne&s;s could be&s;tow, and for the pre&s;ent pitch'd upon a Place call'd the <HI>Devil</HI>'s <HI>I&s;lands,</HI> in the River of <HI>Surinam,</HI> on the Coa&s;t of
<PB N="165" REF="172">
<HI>Caiana,</HI> where they arrived, and found the civile&s;t Reception imaginable, not only from the Gover|nor and Factory, but their Wives, who exchang|ed Wares and drove a con&s;iderable Trade with them.</P>
<P>They &s;eized in this River a Sloop, and by her gained Intelligence, that a Brigantine had al&s;o &s;ailed in Company with her, from <HI>Rhode I&s;land,</HI> laden with Provi&s;ions for the Coa&s;t. A Welcome Cargo! They growing &s;hort in the Sea Store, and as <HI>Sancho</HI> &s;ays, <HI>No Adventures to be made without Belly-Timber.</HI> One Evening as they were rumaging (their Mine of Trea&s;ure,) the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Prize, this expect|ed Ve&s;&s;el was de&s;cry'd at Ma&s;t-Head, and <HI>Roberts,</HI> ima|gining no Body could do Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o well as him&s;elf, takes 40 Men into the Sloop, and goes in pur&s;uit of her; but a fatal Accident followed this ra&s;h, tho' incon&s;iderable Adventure, for <HI>Roberts</HI> thinking of nothing le&s;s than bringing in the Brigantine that Afternoon, never troubled his Head about the Sloop's Provi&s;ion, nor inquired what there was on Board to &s;ub&s;i&s;t &s;uch a Number of Men; but out he &s;ails after his expected Prize, which he not only lo&s;t further Sight of, but after eight Days contending with contrary Winds and Currents, found them&s;elves thirty Leagues to Leeward, and almo&s;t fami&s;hed. The Current &s;till oppo&s;ing their Endeavours, and perceiving no Hopes of beating up to their Ship, they incon&s;iderately &s;ent away the Boat to give the re&s;t of the Company Notice of their Condition, and to order the Ship down to them; in the mean while they brought the Sloop to an Anchor, but now their Wants too &s;oon made them &s;en&s;ible of their Infatuation, for their Water was all gone, and they had no thought how they &s;hould be &s;upply'd, till either the Ship came to 'em, or the Boat returned, which was not likely to be under five or &s;ix Days. Here like
<PB N="166" REF="173">
<HI>Tantalus,</HI> they almo&s;t fami&s;hed in Sight of the fre&s;h Streams and Lakes, being drove to &s;uch Ex|tremity at la&s;t, that they were forc'd to tare up the Floor of the Cabin, and patch up a &s;ort of a Tub or Tray with Rope Yarns, to paddle a&s;hore, and fetch off immediate Supplies of Water to pre|&s;erve Life.</P>
<P>After &s;ome Days, the long-wi&s;h'd-for Boat came back, but with the mo&s;t unwellcome News in the World to them, for one <HI>Kennedy,</HI> who was Lieute|nant, and left in Ab&s;ence of <HI>Roberts,</HI> to Command the Privateer and Prize, was gone off with both. This was Mortification with a Vengance, and you may imagine, they did not depart without &s;ome hard Speeches from tho&s;e that were left, and had &s;uf|fered by their Treachery. And that there need be no further mention of this <HI>Kennedy,</HI> I &s;hall leave Captain <HI>Roberts,</HI> for a Page or two, with the Re|mains of his Crew, to vent their Wrath in a few Oaths and Execrations, and follow the other, whom we may reckon was &s;teering his Cour&s;e to|wards <HI>Execution Deck.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Kennedy</HI> and tho&s;e with him went into the Latitude of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and took three or four &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, and as they did not de&s;ign to pur&s;ue <HI>the Account,</HI> (as they called it) any longer, they &s;hared the Booty, which came to a good round Sum to each Man, and parted, in order to &s;hift for them&s;elves, in the &s;everal Ve&s;&s;els they had taken: Nine of them met with a Ship of 150 Tun, that &s;hall be namele&s;s, and came home to <HI>England</HI> in her; the Ma&s;ter was paid well for their Pa&s;&s;age, and the re&s;t of the Crew liv'd ne'er the wor&s;e in the Voy|age; in &s;hort, they landed &s;afely in the We&s;t of <HI>England,</HI> and two or three of them live at this Time within a hundred Miles of <HI>Bri&s;tol.</HI></P>
<P>Another Ve&s;&s;el, belonging to this Gang, fell in with a peaceable Ship belonging to <HI>Virginia</HI> Cap|tain
<PB N="167" REF="174">
<HI>Knot</HI> Commander, a Quaker, who had neither Pi&s;tol, Sword, nor Cutla&s;h on Board; and the Cap|tain him&s;elf, appearing &s;o very Pa&s;&s;ive at all they &s;aid to him, that they thought none &s;o pro|per to go off with, as this Man. Accordingly they went aboard, and he carried them to <HI>Virginia:</HI> They made the Quaker a Pre&s;ent of 10 Che&s;ts of Sugar, 10 Rolls of <HI>Bra&s;il</HI> Tobaco, 30 Moidors, and &s;ome Gold-Du&s;t, in all to the Value of about 250 l. They al&s;o made Pre&s;ents to the Sailors, &s;ome more, &s;ome le&s;s, and liv'd a jovial Life all the while they were upon their Voy|age; and Captain <HI>Knot</HI> gave them their Way, letting them do as they plea&s;ed, nor indeed could he help him&s;elf, unle&s;s he had taken an Opportu|nity to &s;urprize them, when they were drunk or a &s;leep; for they wore Arms aboard the Ship, which put him in a continual Terror. It not being his Principle to fight, or u&s;e Weapons, he was obliged to manage them with Art and Addre&s;s, till he could rid him&s;elf of &s;uch trouble&s;ome Gue&s;ts. When the Ship came to the Capes, four of the Py|rates went off in a Boat, which they had taken with them, for their more ea&s;ily making their E&s;capes, and made up the Bay towards <HI>Maryland,</HI> but were forced back by a Storm into an ob&s;cure Place of the Country, where meeting with good Entertainment among the Planters, they continued &s;everal Days without being di&s;covered to be Py|rates. In the mean Time Captain <HI>Knot</HI> leaving four others on Board his Ship, (who intended to go off to <HI>North-Carolina,)</HI> made what ha&s;t he could to di&s;cover to Mr. <HI>Spot&s;wood</HI> the Governor, what &s;ort of Pa&s;&s;engers he had been forced to bring with him, who by good Fortune got them &s;eized; and Search being made after the others, who were revelling about the Country, they were al&s;o taken; and being try'd, they were all convicted
<PB N="168" REF="175">
and hanged. The latter had found Means to lodge Part of their Wealth with the Planters, who never brought it to Account: But Captain <HI>Knot,</HI> &s;urrender'd up every Thing that belonged to them, that were taken aboard, even what had been pre|&s;ented to him, in lieu of what they had from him, in their Pa&s;&s;age, and obliged his Men to do the like.</P>
<P><HI>Kennedy</HI> him&s;elf, with five or &s;ix more, came &s;afe to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and from thence to <HI>England,</HI> and liv'd here undi&s;covered &s;ome Time, and perhaps had done &s;o &s;till, had not his Si&s;ter, out of mere Malice, (provoked thereto by a Quarrel,) given an Information again&s;t him. Two or three others were inform'd again&s;t, at the &s;ame Time, and, for ought I know, by the &s;ame Per&s;on; and they were committed to <HI>Newgate:</HI> One was made an Evidence, and two, <HI>viz. Walter Kennedy</HI> and <HI>James Brad&s;haw,</HI> were try'd and convicted at the <HI>Old Bay|ly,</HI> by a High Court of Admiralty, <HI>July</HI> 3d, 1721. <HI>Brad&s;haw</HI> was tran&s;ported, but <HI>Kennedy,</HI> received the full Puni&s;hment due to his Crimes, the 19th of the &s;aid Month, at <HI>Execution-Dock.</HI> One <HI>E&s;twell</HI> was try'd in <HI>Holland,</HI> but had the good Fortune to evade the Law, for want of Proof: And four others were found Guilty, and executed near St. <HI>Stephen</HI>'s<HI>-Green,</HI> in <HI>Dublin,</HI> about the &s;ame Time.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee what a di&s;a&s;trious Fate, ever at|tends the Wicked, and how rarely they e&s;cape the Puni&s;hment due to their Crimes, who abandon them&s;elves to &s;uch a profligate Life, as to rob, &s;poil, and prey upon Mankind, contrary to the Light and Law of Nature, as well as the Law of God. 'Tis to be hoped that the Examples of the&s;e Deaths, may &s;tand like Marks, or fatal Rocks and Sands, to warn others from the &s;ame Shipwreck and Ruin for the Future. And that the few of

<P>The&s;e we are a&s;&s;ured were &s;ome of <HI>Roberts</HI>'s Articles, but as they had taken Care to throw over-board the Original they had &s;ign'd and Sworn to, there is a great deal of Room to &s;u&s;|pect, the remainder contained &s;omething too hor|rid to be di&s;clo&s;ed to any, except &s;uch as were wil|ling to be Sharers in the Iniquity of them; let them be what they will, they were together the Te&s;t of all new Comers, who were initiated by an Oath, and who &s;ub&s;cribed to them, in Pre&s;ence of the wor|&s;hipful Mr. <HI>Roberts.</HI> And in Ca&s;e any Doubt &s;hould ari&s;e concerning the Con&s;truction of the&s;e Laws, and it &s;hould remain a Di&s;pute whether the Party had infring'd them or no, a Jury is appointed to ex|plain them, and bring in a Verdict upon the Ca&s;e in doubt.</P>
<P>Since we are now &s;peaking of the Laws of this Company, we &s;hall go on, and, in as brief a man|ner as we can, relate the principal Cu&s;toms, and Government, of this rogui&s;h Common-Wealth; which are pretty near the &s;ame with all Pyrates, there not being any material Difference between, them in the&s;e Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>For the Puni&s;hment of &s;mall Offences, which are not provided for by the Articles, and which are not of Con&s;equence enough to be left to a Jury, there is a principal Officer among the Pyrates, called the Quarter-Ma&s;ter, of the Mens own chu|&s;ing, who claims all Authority this Way, (except|ing
<PB N="173" REF="180">
in Time of Battle:) If they di&s;obey his Com|mand, are quarrel&s;ome and mutinous with one ano|ther, mi&s;u&s;e Pri&s;oners, plunder beyond his Order, and in particular, if they be negligent of their Arms, which he mu&s;ters at Di&s;cretion, he pu|ni&s;hes at his own Di&s;cretion, with drubbing or whipping, which no one el&s;e dare do without in|curring the La&s;h from all the Ships Company. In &s;hort, this Officer is Tru&s;tee for the whole, is the fir&s;t on Board any Prize, &s;eparating, for the Company's U&s;e, what he plea&s;es, and returning what he thinks &s;it to the Owners, excepting Gold and Silver, which they have voted not returnable.</P>
<P>After a De&s;cription of the Quarter-Ma&s;ter, and his Duty, who acts as a &s;ort of a civil Magi&s;trate on Board a Pyrate Ship; I &s;hall con&s;ider their mi|litary Officer, the Captain; what Privileges he ex|erts in &s;uch anarchy and unrulyne&s;s of the Mem|bers: Why truly very little, they only permit him to be Captain on Condition that they may be Captain over him; they &s;eparate to his U&s;e the great Cabbin, and &s;ometimes Vote him &s;mall parcels of Plate and China; but then every Man as the Hu|mour takes him, will u&s;e the Plate and China, intrude into his Apartment, &s;wear at him, &s;eize a Part of his Victuals and Drink, if they like it, without his offering to find Fault or Conte&s;t it: Yet <HI>Roberts</HI> by a better Management than u&s;ual, became the cheif Director in every Thing of Moment, and it hap|pened thus:&mdash;The rank of Captain being ob|tained by the Suffrage of the Majority, it falls on one Superior for Knowledge and Boldne&s;s, <HI>Pi|&s;tol Proof</HI> (as they call it,) and can make tho&s;e fear, who do not love him; <HI>Roberts</HI> is &s;aid to have exceeded his Fellows in the&s;e Re&s;pects, and when advanced, enlarged the Re&s;pect that follow|ed it, by making a &s;ort of Privy-Council of half a Dozen of the greate&s;t Bullies; &s;uch were his
<PB N="174" REF="181">
Conpetitors, and had Intere&s;t enough to make his Government ea&s;y; yet even tho&s;e, in the latter Part of his Reign, he had ran counter to in every Project that oppo&s;ed his own Opinion; for which, and becau&s;e he grew re&s;erved, and would not drink and roar at their Rate, a Cabal was formed to take away his Captain&s;hip, which Death did more effectually.</P>
<P>The Captain's Power is uncontroulable in Cha&s;e, or in Battle; drubing, cutting, or even &s;hooting any one who dares deny his Command. The &s;ame Privi|ledge he takes over Pri&s;oners, who receive good or ill U&s;age, mo&s;tly as he approves of their Behaviour, for tho' the meane&s;t would take upon them to mi&s;u&s;e a Ma&s;ter of a Ship, yet he would controul herein, when he &s;ee it, and merrily over a Bottle, give his Pri&s;oners this double Rea&s;on for it. Fir&s;t, That it pre&s;erved his Precedency; and &s;econdly, That it took the Puni&s;hment out of the Hands of a much more ra&s;h and mad Set of Fellows than him&s;elf. When he found that Ri|gour was not expected from his People, (for he often practi&s;ed it to appea&s;e them,) then he would give Strangers to under&s;tand, that it was pure Inclination that induced him to a good Treatment of them, and not any Love or Partiality to their Per&s;ons; <HI>for,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>there is none of you but will hang me, I know, whenever you can clinch me with|in your Power.</HI></P>
<P>And now &s;eeing the Di&s;advantages they were under for per&s;uing the Account, <HI>viz.</HI> a &s;mall Ve&s;|&s;el ill repaired, and without Provi&s;ions, or Stores; they re&s;olved one and all, with the little Supplies they could get, to proceed for the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> not doubting to find a Remedy for all the&s;e Evils, and to retrieve their Lo&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="182">
In the Latitude of <HI>De&s;eada,</HI> one of the I&s;lands, they took two Sloops, which &s;upply'd them with Provi&s;ions and other Nece&s;&s;aries; and a few Days afterwards, took a Brigantine belonging to <HI>Rhode</HI> I&s;land, which being fit for their Purpo&s;e, they converted to their own U&s;e.</P>
<P>With the&s;e two Ve&s;&s;els they proceeded to <HI>Bar|badoes,</HI> off of which I&s;land, they fell in with a <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> Ship of 10 Guns, in her Voyage out, from whom they took abundance of Cloaths, &s;ome Money, twenty five Bails of Goods, five Barrels of Powder, a Cable and Haw&s;er, ten Casks of Oatmeal, &s;ix Casks of Beef, and &s;everal other Goods, be&s;ides five of their Men; and after they had detained her three Days, let her go; who being bound for the above &s;aid I&s;land, &s;he acquainted the Governor with what had happened, as &s;oon as &s;he arrived.</P>
<P>Whereupon a <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> Galley that lay in the Har|bour, was ordered to be fitted out with all imagi|nable Expedition, with 20 Guns, and 80 Men, there being then no Man of War upon that Station, and al&s;o a Sloop with 10 Guns, and 40 Men: The Galley was commanded by one Captain <HI>Rogers,</HI> of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and the Sloop by Captain <HI>Graves,</HI> of that I&s;land, and Captain <HI>Rogers</HI> by a Commi&s;&s;ion from the Governour, was appointed Commadore.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Day after <HI>Rogers</HI> &s;ailed out of the Harbour, he was di&s;covered by <HI>Roberts</HI> and his Con&s;ort, who knowing nothing of their De&s;ign, gave them Cha&s;e. The <HI>Barbadoes</HI> Ships, kept an ea&s;y Sail till the Pyrates came up with them, and then <HI>Roberts</HI> gave them a Gun, expecting they would have immediately &s;truck to his pyratical Flag, but in&s;tead thereof, he was forced to re|ceive the Fire of a Broad&s;ide, with three Huzza's at the &s;ame Time; &s;o an Engagement en&s;ued be|twixt the Galley and <HI>Roberts</HI>'s Sloop, and likewi&s;e between the Brigantine, and the Sloop which Cap|tain
<PB N="176" REF="183">
<HI>Graves</HI> commanded, for about two Hours; in which &s;everal Men were kill'd on both Sides, when <HI>Rogers</HI> grew weary of the Di&s;pute, and left off on Pretence of &s;plicing and knotting his Rigging. The Pyrate Brigantine was but ill Mann'd, and might ea&s;ily have been taken by <HI>Graves</HI>'s Sloop, which would have been the De&s;truction of them both, had <HI>Rogers</HI> been as Zealous for the Service, after he had engaged, as he was before he &s;ailed out of <HI>Barbadoes.</HI></P>
<P>When the Heroes returned into Harbour, they made the mo&s;t of this Adventure, and the Story was magnified to a Degree much beyond the Truth, as that they had kill'd 30 or 40 Men, cut and tore all their Rigging, and &s;hattered their Hull to Pieces; but the Rea&s;on alledged for their not taking them, was, that the Pyrates out &s;ail'd them, and &s;o run away.</P>
<P><HI>Roberts</HI> lo&s;t five Men, and had as many wounded, and might very well have rally'd again, had there been any Thing to have been got by the Bargain; but as the Pyrates were not &s;o much in &s;earch of Fame, as Plunder, they did not think the ta|king of a hungry Privateer or two would recom|pence the Labour, and &s;o troubled them&s;elves no further.</P>
<P>The Night after this Engagement, the Brigan|tine went away, and left <HI>Roberts</HI> by him&s;elf, in as ill a Condition as <HI>Kennedy</HI> had done.</P>
<P>After the lo&s;s of the Brigantine, Captain <HI>Roberts</HI> &s;ail'd in the Sloop to the I&s;land of <HI>Dominico,</HI> where he watered, and got Provi&s;ions of the Inhabitants, to whom he gave Goods in Exchange. At this Place he met with 13 <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men, who had been &s;et a&s;hore by a <HI>French Guard de la Co&s;te,</HI> belonging to <HI>Martinico,</HI> and taken out of two <HI>New-England</HI> Ships, that had been &s;eized, as Prize, by the &s;aid <HI>French</HI>

<P>They &s;taid not long here, tho they had imme|diate Occa&s;ion for cleaning their Sloop, but did not think this a proper Place, and herein they judg'd right; for the touching at this I&s;land, had like to have been their De&s;truction, for they ha|ving re&s;olved to go away to the <HI>Granada</HI> I&s;lands, for the afore&s;aid Purpo&s;e, by &s;ome Accident it came to be known to the <HI>French</HI> Colony, who &s;end|ing Word to the Govornor of <HI>Martinico,</HI> he equip|ped and manned two Sloops to go in que&s;t of them. The Pyrates &s;ailed directly for the <HI>Grana|dilloes,</HI> and hall'd into a Lagoon, at <HI>Corvocoo,</HI> where they cleaned with unu&s;ual Di&s;patch, &s;taying but a little above a Week, by which Expedition they mi&s;&s;ed of the <HI>Martinico</HI> Sloops, only a few Hours; <HI>Roberts</HI> &s;ailed over Night, that the <HI>French</HI> Men ar|rived the next Morning. This was a fortunate E&s;cape, e&s;pecially con&s;idering, that it was not from any Fears of their being di&s;covered, that they made &s;o much ha&s;t from the I&s;land; but, as they had the Impudence them&s;elves to own, for the want of Wine and Women.</P>
<P>Thus narrowly e&s;caped, they &s;ailed for <HI>Newfound|land,</HI> and arrived upon the Banks the latter end of <HI>June,</HI> 1720. They entered the Harbour of <HI>Tre|pa&s;&s;i,</HI> with their black Colours flying, Drums bea|ting, and Trumpets &s;ounding. There were two and twenty Ve&s;&s;els in the Harbour, which the Men all quitted upon the Sight of the Pyrate, and fled a&s;hore. It is impo&s;&s;ible particularly to recount the De&s;truction and Havock they made here, burn|ing and &s;inking all the &s;hipping, except a <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> Galley, de&s;troying the Fi&s;heries, and Stages of the Planters, which might cau&s;e the Sufferers to make this Reflection: That nothing is &s;o deplo|rable

as Power in mean and ignorant Hands, it makes them wanton and giddy, unconcern'd at the Misfortunes they are impo&s;ing on their fellow Crea|tures, and will make them &s;mile at the Mi&s;chiefs, that bring them&s;elves no Advantage. <HI>They are like mad Men that ca&s;t Fire-Brands, Arrows, and Death, and &s;ay, are not we in Sport?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Roberts</HI> mann'd the <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> Galley, he took in the Harbour, and mounted 16 Guns on Board her, and crui&s;ing out upon the Banks, where he met with nine or ten Sail of <HI>French</HI> Ships, all which he de&s;troyed except one of 26 Guns, which they &s;eized, and carried off for their own U&s;e. This Ship they chri&s;tned <HI>the Fortune,</HI> and leaving the <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> Galley to the <HI>French</HI> Men; they &s;ail'd away in Company with the Sloop, for a Crui&s;e, and took &s;everal Prizes, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Richard,</HI> of <HI>Biddiford, Jona|than Whitfield</HI> Ma&s;ter; the <HI>Willing Mind</HI> of <HI>Pool;</HI> the <HI>Expectation,</HI> of <HI>Top&s;ham;</HI> and the <HI>Samuel,</HI> Captain <HI>Cary,</HI> of <HI>London;</HI> out of the&s;e Ships they encrea&s;ed their Company, by entring all the Men they could well &s;pare, in their own Service. The <HI>Samuel</HI> was a rich Ship, and had &s;everal Pa&s;&s;engers on Board, who were u&s;ed very roughly, in order to make them di&s;cover their Money, threatning them every Moment with Death, if they did not re&s;ign every Thing up to them. They tore up the Hatches and entered the Hold like a parcel of Furies, and with Axes and Cutla&s;hes, cut and broke open all the Bales, Ca&s;es, and Boxes, they could lay their Hands on; and when any Goods came upon Deck, that they did not like to carry aboard, in&s;tead of to&s;&s;ing them into the Hold again, threw them over-board into the Sea; all this was done with ince&s;&s;ant cur&s;ing and &s;wearing, more like Fiends than Men. They carried with them, Sails, Guns, Powder, and Cordage, and 8 or <HI>9000l.</HI> worth of the choice&s;t Goods; and told Captain
<PB N="179" REF="186">
<HI>Cary, That they &s;hould accept of no Act of Grace; that the K&mdash;and P&mdash;t might be damned with their Acts of G&mdash;for them, neither would they go to</HI> Hope-Point, <HI>to be hang'd up a Sun drying, as</HI> Kidd<HI>'s, and</HI> Braddi&s;h<HI>'s Company were; but that if they &s;hould ever be overpower'd, they would &s;et Fire to the Powder, with a Pi&s;tol, and go all merrily to Hell together.</HI></P>
<P>After they had brought all the Booty aboard, a Con&s;ultation was held whether they &s;hould &s;ink or burn the Ship, but whil&s;t they were debating the Matter, they &s;py'd a Sail, and &s;o left the <HI>Sa|muel,</HI> to give her Chace; at Midnight they came up with the &s;ame, which proved to be a Snow from <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> bound for <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> Captain <HI>Bowles</HI> Ma&s;ter: They us'd him barbarou&s;ly, becau&s;e of his Coun|try, for the &s;ake of Captain <HI>Rogers,</HI> who attacked them off <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> he being of the City of <HI>Bri&s;tol.</HI></P>
<P><HI>July</HI> the 16th, which was two Days afterwards, they took a <HI>Virginia</HI> Man call'd the <HI>Little York, James Philips</HI> Ma&s;ter, and the <HI>Love,</HI> of <HI>Leverpool,</HI> which they plundered and let go; and the next Day a Snow from <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> called the <HI>Phaenix, John Richards</HI> Ma&s;ter, met with the &s;ame Fate; as al&s;o a Brigantine, Cap|tain <HI>Thomas,</HI> and a Sloop called the <HI>Sadbury;</HI> they took all the Men out of the Brigantine, and &s;unk the Ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>When they left the Banks of <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> they &s;ailed for the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and the Provi&s;ions grow|ing &s;hort, they went for the Latitude of the I&s;land <HI>De&s;edea,</HI> to crui&s;e, it being e&s;teemed the likelie&s;t Place to meet with &s;uch Ships as (they u&s;ed in their Mirth to &s;ay) were configned to them, with Sup|plies.

<PB N="180" REF="187">
pretty &s;ure of bringing their Cargo to a good Market.</P>
<P>However, at this Time they mi&s;&s;ed of their u&s;ual Luck, and Provi&s;ions and Nece&s;&s;aries be|coming more &s;carce every Day, they retired to|wards St. <HI>Chri&s;tophers,</HI> where being deny'd all Suc|cour or A&s;&s;i&s;tance from the Government, they fir'd in Revenge on the Town, and burnt two Ships in the Road, one of them commanded by Captain <HI>Cox,</HI> of <HI>Bri&s;tol;</HI> and then retreated farther to the I&s;land of St. <HI>Bartholomew,</HI> where they met with much hand&s;omer Treatment. The Governor not only &s;upplying them with Refre&s;hments, but carre&s;&s;|ed them in the mo&s;t friendly Manner: And the Wo|men, from &s;o good an Example &s;et them by the Men, endeavoured to outvie each other in Dre&s;s, and Behaviour, to attract the good Graces of &s;uch generous Lovers, that paid &s;o well for their Favours.</P>
<P>Sated at length with the&s;e Plea&s;ures, and ha|ving taken on Board a good &s;upply of fre&s;h Provi|&s;ions, they voted unanimou&s;ly for the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea,</HI> and in the Latitude of 22 N. in their Voy|age thither, met with a <HI>French</HI> Ship from <HI>Martinico,</HI> richly laden, and, which was unlucky for the Ma&s;ter, had a property of being fitter for their Purpo&s;e, than the Banker. <HI>Exchange was no Robbery</HI> they &s;aid, and &s;o after a little mock Complai|&s;ance to <HI>Mon&s;ieur,</HI> for the Favour he had done them, they &s;hifted their Men, and took leave: This was their fir&s;t <HI>Royal Fortune.</HI></P>
<P>In this Ship <HI>Roberts</HI> proceeded on his de&s;ign'd Voyage; but before they reached <HI>Guinea,</HI> he pro|po&s;ed to touch at <HI>Brava,</HI> the Southermo&s;t of <HI>Cape Verd</HI> I&s;lands, and clean.

A &s;ad Circum&s;tance that eminently expo&s;es the Folly and Madne&s;s among the Pyrates, and he mu&s;t be an incon&s;ide|rate Wretch indeed, who, if he could &s;eparate the Wickedne&s;s and Puni&s;hment from the Fact, would yet hazard his Life amid&s;t &s;uch Dangers, as their want of Skill and Foreca&s;t, made them liable to.</P>
<P>Their Sins, we may pre&s;ume, were never &s;o trou|ble&s;ome to their Memories, as now, when there was not the lea&s;t Glymp&s;e of Comfort alive; an inevitable De&s;truction &s;eem'd to threaten them, and without the miraculous Intervention of Pro|vidence, there appeared only this mi&s;erable Choice, <HI>viz.</HI> a pre&s;ent Death by their own Hands, or a lingring one by Famine; for none could have the Face to look upwards for Relief, when they had to that Moment defy'd the Power which alone could pre&s;erve them. How dreadful the Thoughts of their pa&s;t mi&s;pent Life mu&s;t be, under their pre|&s;ent deplorable Circum&s;tances, let the Reader judge!</P>
<P>They continued their Cour&s;e, and came to an Allowance of one &s;ingle Mouthful of Water for 24 Hours; many of them drank their Urine, or Sea Water, which in&s;tead of allaying, gave them an inextingui&s;hable Thir&s;t, that kill'd them: Others pined and wa&s;ted a little more Time in Fluxes and Apyrexies, &s;o that they dropped away daily: Tho&s;e that &s;u&s;tain'd the Mi&s;ery be&s;t, were &s;uch as almo&s;t &s;tarved them&s;elves, forbearing all &s;orts of Food, unle&s;s a Mouthful or two of Bread the whole

<P>But if the di&s;mal Pro&s;pect they &s;et out with, gave them Anxiety, Trouble, or Pain, what mu&s;t their Fears and Apprehen&s;ions be, when they had not one Drop of Water left, or any Thing el&s;e, that could &s;upport Life. This was their Ca&s;e, when (by the working of Divine Providence, no doubt,) they were brought into Soundings, and at Night anchor'd in &s;even Fathom Water: This was an inexpre&s;&s;ible Joy to them, and as it were, fed the expiring Lamp of Life with fre&s;h Spirits; but this could not hold long. When the Morning came, they &s;aw Land from the Ma&s;t-Head, but it was at &s;o a great Di&s;tance, that it afforded but an indifferent Pro&s;pect to Men who had drank nothing for the la&s;t two Days; however, they di&s;patch'd their Boat away, and late the &s;ame Night it return'd, to their no &s;mall Comfort, with a Load of Water, inform|ing them, that they had got off the Mouth of <HI>Me|riwinga</HI> River, on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Surinam.</HI></P>
<P>One would have thought &s;o miraculous an E&s;cape &s;hould have wrought &s;ome Reformation, but ala&s;s, they had no &s;ooner quenched their Thir&s;t, but they had forgot their Drowth, till &s;carcity of Provi&s;ions awakened their Sen&s;es, and bid them guard again&s;t &s;tarving; their Allowance was very &s;mall, and yet they would profanely &s;ay, <HI>That Providence which had gave them Drink, would no doubt, bring them Meat al&s;o, if they would u&s;e but an hone&s;t Endeavour.</HI></P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of the&s;e hone&s;t Endeavours, they were &s;teering for the Latitude of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> with what little they had left, to look out for more, or Starve; and in their Way met a Ship that an|&s;wered their Nece&s;&s;ities, and after that, a Brigantine; the former was call'd the <HI>Greyhound,</HI> belonging to St. <HI>Chri&s;tophers,</HI> and bound to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> the Mate

of which &s;igned the Pyrate's Articles, and was afterwards Captain of the <HI>Ranger,</HI> Con&s;ort to the <HI>Royal Fortune.</HI></P>
<P>Out of the Ship and Brigantine, the Pyrates got a good &s;upply of Provi&s;ions and Liquor, &s;o that they gave over the de&s;ign'd Crui&s;e, and watered at <HI>Tobago,</HI> and then came to the I&s;land of <HI>Marti|nico,</HI> to make the Governor &s;ome &s;ort of an Equivalent, for the Care and Expedition he had &s;hewn, in fitting out two Sloops, to intercept them at <HI>Corvocoo.</HI></P>
<P>It is the Cu&s;tom it &s;eems at <HI>Martinico,</HI> for <HI>Dutch</HI> In|terlopers that have a mind to Trade with the People of the I&s;land, to hoi&s;t their Jacks when they come before the Town: <HI>Roberts</HI> knew the Signal, and being an utter Enemy to them, he bent his Thoughts upon Mi&s;chief; and accordingly came in with his Jack flying, which, as he expected, they mi&s;took for a good Market, and thought them|&s;elves happie&s;t that could &s;oone&s;t dipatch off their Sloops and Ve&s;&s;els, for Trade: When <HI>Roberts</HI> had got them within his Power, (one after another,) he told them, he would not have it &s;aid that they came off for nothing, and therefore ordered them to leave their Money behind, for that they were a Parcel of Rogues, and hoped they would always meet with &s;uch a <HI>Dutch</HI> Trade as this was; he re&s;erved one Ve&s;&s;el to &s;et the Pa&s;&s;engers on Shore again, and fired the re&s;t, to the Number of twenty.</P>
<P>At <HI>Dominico,</HI> the next I&s;land he touched at, they took a <HI>Dutch</HI> Interloper, of 22 Guns, and 75 Men; and a Brigantine belonging to <HI>Rhode I&s;land,</HI> one <HI>Nor|ton</HI> Ma&s;ter. The former made &s;ome Defence, till &s;ome of his Men being killed, the re&s;t were di&s;|couraged, and &s;truck the Colours. With the&s;e two Prizes they went down to <HI>Guadalupe,</HI> and brought
<PB N="184" REF="191">
out a Sloop, and a great <HI>French</HI> Fly-Boat, laden with Sugar; the Sloop they burnt, and went on to <HI>Moonay,</HI> another I&s;land, thinking to Clean, but finding the Sea ran too high there, to undertake it with Safety, they bent their Cour&s;e for the North Part of <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> where at <HI>Bennet</HI>'s Key, in the Gulf of <HI>Saminah,</HI> they cleaned both the Ship and the Brigantine. For tho' <HI>Hi&s;paniola</HI> be &s;ettled by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> and is the Re&s;i|dence of a Pre&s;ident from <HI>Spain,</HI> who receives, and finally determines Appeals from all the other <HI>Spani&s;h We&s;t-India</HI> I&s;lands; yet is its People by no Means proportioned to its Magnitude, &s;o that there are many Harbours in it, to which Pyrates may &s;ecurely re&s;ort, without Fear of Di&s;covery from the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t they were here, two Sloops came in, as they pretended, to pay <HI>Roberts</HI> a Vi&s;it, the Ma&s;ters, who&s;e Names were <HI>Porter,</HI> and <HI>Tuckerman,</HI> addre&s;&s;ed the Pyrate, as the Queen of <HI>Sheba</HI> did <HI>Solomon,</HI> to wit, <HI>That having heard of his Fame,</HI> and Atcheivments, they had put in their to learn his Art and Wi&s;|dom, in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of pyrating, being Ve&s;&s;els on the &s;ame honourable De&s;ign with him&s;elf; and hoped with the Communication of his Knowledge, they &s;hould al&s;o receive his Charity, being in want of Nece&s;&s;aries for &s;uch Adventures. <HI>Roberts</HI> was won upon by the Peculiarity and Bluntne&s;s of the&s;e two Men, and gave them Powder, Arms, and what|ever el&s;e they had Occa&s;ion for, &s;pent two or three merry Nights with them, and at parting &s;aid, he hoped the L&mdash;would Pro&s;per their handy Works.</P>
<P>They pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome Time here, after they had got their Ve&s;&s;el ready, in their u&s;ual Debaucheries; they had taken a con&s;iderable Quantity of Rum and Sugar, &s;o that Liquor was as plenty as
<PB N="185" REF="192">
Water, and few there were, who deny'd them|&s;elves the immoderate U&s;e of it; nay, Sobriety brought a Man under a Su&s;picion of being in a Plot again&s;t the Common-Wealth, and in their Sen&s;e, he was looked upon to be a Villain that would not be drunk. This was evident in the Affair of <HI>Harry Glasby,</HI> cho&s;en Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Royal Fortune,</HI> who, with two others, laid hold of an Opportunity at this Place, to move off with|out bidding Farewel to his Friends. <HI>Glasby,</HI> was a re&s;erved &s;ober Man, and therefore gave Occa|&s;ion to be &s;u&s;pected, &s;o that he was &s;oon mi&s;&s;ed af|ter he went away; and a Detachment being &s;ent in que&s;t of the Di&s;erters, they were all three brought back again the next Day. This was a capital Offence, and for which they were ordered to be brought to an immediate Tryal.</P>
<P>Here was the Form of Ju&s;tice kept up, which is as much as can be &s;aid of &s;everal other Courts, who have more lawful Commi&s;&s;ions for what they do.&mdash;Here was no feeing of Council, and bri|bing of Witne&s;&s;es was a Cu&s;tom not known among them; no packing of Juries, no torturing and wre&s;ting the Sen&s;e of the Law, for bye Ends and Purpo&s;es, no puzzling or perplexing the Cau&s;e, with untelligi|ble canting Terms, and u&s;ele&s;s De&s;tinctions; nor was their Se&s;&s;ions burthen'd with numberle&s;s Officers, the Mini&s;ters of Rapine, and Extortion, with ill boding A&s;pects, enough to fright <HI>A&s;trea</HI> from the Court.</P>
<P>The Place appointed for their Tryals, was the Steerage of the Ship; in order to which, a large Bowl of Rum Punch was made, and placed upon the Table, the Pipes and Tobacco being ready, the judicial Proceedings began; the Pri&s;oners were brought forth, and Articles of Indictment again&s;t them read; they were arraigned upon a Statute of their own making, and the Letter of the Law
<PB N="186" REF="193">
being &s;trong again&s;t them, and the Fact plainly proved, they were about to pronounce Sentence, when one of the Judges mov'd, that they &s;hould fir&s;t Smoak t'other Pipe; which was according|ly done.</P>
<P>All the Pri&s;oners pleaded for Arre&s;t of Judge|ment very movingly, but, the Court had &s;uch an Abhorrence of their Crime, that they could not be prevailed upon to &s;hew Mercy; till one of the Judges, who&s;e Name was <HI>Valentine A&s;hplant,</HI> &s;tood up, and taking his Pipe out of his Mouth, &s;aid, he had &s;omething to offer to the Court, in be|half of one of the Pri&s;oners; and &s;poke to this Effect.<HI>&mdash;By G&mdash;,</HI> Glasby <HI>&s;hould not dye; d&mdash;n him if he &s;hould.</HI> After this learned Speech, he &s;at down in his Place, and re&s;umed his Pipe. This Motion was loudly oppo&s;ed by all the re&s;t of the Judges, in equivalent Terms; but <HI>A&s;hplant,</HI> who was re&s;olute in his Opinion, made another pathe|tical Speech, in the following Manner. <HI>G&mdash;d&mdash;n you Gentlemen, I am as good a Man as the be&s;t of you; d&mdash;n my</HI> S&mdash;l <HI>if ever I turn'd my Back to any Man in my Life, nor ever will, by G&mdash;;</HI> Glasby <HI>is an hone&s;t Fellow, notwith&s;tanding this Misfortune, and I love him; D&mdash;l d&mdash;n me, if I don't: I hope he'll live and repent of what he has down; but d&mdash;n me if he mu&s;t dye, I will dye along with him.</HI> And thereupon, he pulled out a pair of Pi&s;tols, and pre&s;ented them to &s;ome of the other learned Judges upon the Bench; who, perceiving his Argument &s;o well &s;upported, thought it rea&s;onable that <HI>Glasby</HI> &s;hould be par|doned; and &s;o they all came over to his Opinion, and allow'd it to be Law.</P>
<P>But all the mitigation that could be obtained for the other Convicts, was, that they &s;hould have the Liberty of choo&s;ing any four of the whole Company to be their Executioners. The poor Wretches were ty'd immediately to the Ma&s;t, and
<PB N="187" REF="194">
there &s;hot dead, pur&s;uant to their villanious Sen|tence.</P>
<P>When they put to Sea again, the Prizes which had been detained only for fear of &s;preading any Rumour, concerning them, which had like to have been &s;o fatal at <HI>Corvocoo,</HI> were thus di&s;po&s;ed of: They burnt their own Sloop, and mann'd <HI>Norton</HI>'s Brigantine, &s;ending the Ma&s;ter away in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Interloper, not di&s;&s;atisfied.</P>
<P>With the <HI>Royal Fortune,</HI> and the Brigantine, they pu&s;hed towards the Latitude of <HI>De&s;edea,</HI> to look out for Provi&s;ions, being very &s;hort again, and ju&s;t to their Wi&s;h, Captain <HI>Hing&s;tone</HI>'s ill Fortune brought him in their Way, richly laden for <HI>Jamai|ca;</HI> him they carried to <HI>Berbudas,</HI> and plundered; and &s;tretching back again to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> they continually met with &s;ome Con&s;ignment or other, (chiefly <HI>French,)</HI> which &s;tored them with Plenty of Provi&s;ions, and recruited their &s;tarving Con|dition; &s;o that &s;tocked with this &s;ort of Am|munition, they began to think of &s;omething wor|thier their Aim, for the&s;e Robberies that only &s;upplyed what was in con&s;tant Expenditure, by no Means an&s;wered their Intentions; and accor|dingly they proceeded again for the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea,</HI> where they thought to buy Gold-Du&s;t very Cheap. In the Pa&s;&s;age thither, they took Numbers of Ships of all Nations, &s;ome of which they burnt or &s;unk, as the Carriage or Characters of the Ma|&s;ters di&s;plea&s;ed them.</P>
<P>About 400 Leagues from the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI> the Brigantine who had hitherto lived with them, in all amicable Corre&s;pondence, and of whom they had no Mi&s;tru&s;t, thought fit to take the Opportu|nity of a dark Night, and leave the Commadore, to return to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> under Captain <HI>Bradley;</HI> this was a &s;en&s;ible Shock to them, (70 Hands being gone away in her,) occa&s;ioned it's thought, from

the Haughty and Magi&s;terial Behaviour of <HI>Roberts</HI> towards them, who regarded the Brigantine only as a Tender, and as &s;uch left them no more than the Refu&s;e of their Plunder; however, he put on a Face of Unconcern, at this his ill Conduct and Mi&s;|management, and re&s;olved not to alter his Purpo&s;es for it.</P>
<P>That we may have no more Occa&s;ion to talk of <HI>George Bradley</HI> hereafter, I &s;hall leave Mr. <HI>Roberts,</HI> to pur&s;ue his Voyage to <HI>Guinea,</HI> while we follow the Adventures of our new Captain, in which I &s;hall be as brief as po&s;&s;ible.</P>

<P>ON the 18th of <HI>April,</HI> 1721, <HI>George Bradley</HI> went off from <HI>Boberts,</HI> in the Brigantine call'd the <HI>Good Fortune,</HI> and returned to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies;</HI> but, tho' the Crew of this Ve&s;&s;el, was unanimous as to their Separation, yet they were not &s;o in their Re&s;olutions, relating to their future Undertakings; &s;ome of them, being for pro&s;ecuting their former villanious Schemes; and others, to &s;ubmit to his Maje&s;ty's Mercy, which could they have had any A&s;&s;urance of, 'tis believed the latter would have prevailed. But there was no Act of Grace then in Force, by which they might be entituled to the Be|nefit of a Pardon, and &s;o there was no Encourage|ment for them to turn Hone&s;t.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Prize they took, (as far as I can learn,) was a Ship belonging to <HI>New-York,</HI> Captain <HI>Mar&s;ton</HI> Commander, betwixt the I&s;land of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and <HI>Hi&s;paniola;</HI> they did not meddle with the Cargo, but took away his Cloaths, Liquors, and Provi|&s;ions, and five of his Men, and then let him go.

There are about 30 <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men in all, Men who in &s;ome Part of their Lives, have been either privateering, buccaneering, or pyrating, and &s;till retain and love the Riots, and Humours, common to that &s;ort of Life. They live very friendly with the Natives, and have many of them, of both Sexes, to be their <HI>Grometta</HI>'s, or Servants: The Men are faithful, and the Women &s;o obedient, that they are very ready to pro&s;titute them&s;elves to whom&s;oever their Ma&s;ters &s;hall command them.

<P>The Harbour is &s;o convenient for Wooding and Watering, that it occa&s;ions many of our trading Ships, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> to call in there, with large Cargoes of Beer, Syder, and &s;trong Ly|quors, which they Exchange with the&s;e private Traders, for Slaves and Teeth, purcha&s;ed by them at the <HI>Rio Nune</HI>'s, and other Places to the North|ward, &s;o that here was what they call good Living.</P>
<P>Hither <HI>Roberts</HI> came the End of <HI>June,</HI> and had In|telligence that the <HI>Swallow,</HI> and <HI>Weymouth,</HI> two Men of War, of 50 Guns, had left that River about a Month before, and de&s;igned to return about <HI>Chri&s;t|mas;</HI> &s;o that the Pyrates could indulge them&s;elves with all the Satisfaction in the World, in that they knew that they were not only &s;ecure whil&s;t there, but that in going down the Coa&s;t, after the Men of War, they &s;hould always be able to get &s;uch Intelligence of their Rendezvous, as would &s;erve to make their Expedition &s;afe. So after &s;ix Weeks &s;tay, the Ships being cleaned and fitted, and the Men weary of whoring and drinking, they bethought them&s;elves of Bu&s;ine&s;s, and went to
<PB N="197" REF="204">
Sea the Beginning of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> taking their Progre&s;s down the whole Coa&s;t, as low as <HI>Jaquin,</HI> plunder|ing every Ship they met, of what was valuable in her, and &s;ometimes to be more mi&s;chieviou&s;ly wicked, would throw what they did not want over-board, accumulating Cruelty to Theft.</P>
<P>In this Range, they exchanged their old <HI>French</HI> Ship, for a fine Frigot built Ship, call'd the <HI>On&s;low,</HI> belonging to the Royal <HI>African</HI> Company, Captain <HI>Gee</HI> Commander, which happened to lye at <HI>Se&s;tos,</HI> to get Water and Nece&s;&s;aries for the Company. A great many of Captain <HI>Gee</HI>'s Men were a&s;hore, when <HI>Roberts</HI> bore down upon her, and &s;o the Ship was the more ea&s;ily &s;urprized into his Hands, tho' had they been all on Board, it was not likely the Ca&s;e would have been otherwi&s;e; for the mo&s;t Part of them voluntarily join'd with the Pyrates, and there &s;eem'd to be a general Di&s;po|&s;ition in the Sailors, towards them; and whenever they talk'd of them, it was with a great deal of Plea&s;ure, commending their brave Actions, as if Robberies on the Sea, had been no more than Feats of Knight-Errantry; &s;o that it was ea&s;y to per|ceive they wi&s;h'd them Succe&s;s; and even &s;ome Soldiers, who were on Board the Ship, and were going as Recruits, to <HI>Cape-Coa&s;t-Ca&s;tle,</HI> in the Company's Service, were &s;o Po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with the gal|lantry of this Life, that they mu&s;t needs offer them&s;elves Voluntiers; but our Pyrates entertain'd &s;o contemptible a Notion of Land-Men, that they ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to receive them; at la&s;t, upon their earne&s;t Prayers and Intreaties, they admit|ted &s;ome of them out of <HI>Charity,</HI> as they were plea&s;ed to term it, allowing them no more than a Quarter-Share; &s;o they were taken on Board.</P>
<P>There was a Clergyman on Board the <HI>On&s;low,</HI> &s;ent from <HI>England,</HI> to be Chaplain of <HI>Cape-Coa&s;t-Ca&s;tle,</HI> &s;ome of the Pyrates were for keeping him,
<PB N="198" REF="205">
alledging merrily, that their Ship wanted a Cha|plain; accordingly they offered him a Share, to take on with them, promi&s;ing, he &s;hould do no|thing for his Money, but make Punch, and &s;ay Prayers; yet, however bruti&s;h they might be in other Things, they bore &s;o great a Re&s;pect to his Order, that they re&s;olved not to force him again&s;t his Inclinations; &s;o the Par&s;on having no reli&s;h for this &s;ort of Life, excu&s;ed him&s;elf from accept|ing the Honour they de&s;igned him; they were &s;a|tisfied with his Excu&s;e, and were &s;o generous to deliver him back every Thing which he owned to be his: The Par&s;on laid hold of this favourable Di&s;po&s;ition of the Pyrates, and laid Claim to &s;everal Things which belonged to others, which were al&s;o given up to his great Satisfaction; in fine, they kept nothing which belonged to the Church, except three Prayer-Books, and a Bottle-Screw, which as I was inform'd by one of the Pyrates him&s;elf, they &s;aid they had Occa&s;ion for, for their own U&s;e.</P>
<P>The Pyrates kept the <HI>Onflow</HI> for their own U&s;e, and gave Captain <HI>Gee</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Ship, and then fell to making &s;uch Alterations as might fit her for a Sea-Rover, pulling down her Bulk-Heads, and making her flu&s;h, &s;o that &s;he became, in all Re&s;pects, as compleat a Ship for their Purpo&s;e, as any they could have found; they continued to her the Name of the <HI>Royal Fortune,</HI> and mounted her with 40 Guns.</P>
<P>She and the <HI>Ranger</HI> proceeded (as I &s;aid before,) to <HI>Jaquin,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Old Calabar,</HI> where they arrived about <HI>October,</HI> in order to clean their Ships, a Place the mo&s;t &s;uitable along the whole Coa&s;t, for there is a Bar with not above 15 Foot Water upon it, and the Channel intricate, &s;o that had the Men of War met with them here, they might have bid Defiance to their Strength,
<PB N="199" REF="206">
for the Depth of Water at the Bar, as well as the want of a Pilot, was a &s;ufficient Security to the Rovers, and invincible Impediments to them. Here therefore they &s;at ea&s;y, and divided the Fruits of their di&s;hone&s;t Indu&s;try, <HI>and drank and drove Care away.</HI> The Pilot who brought them into this Harbour, was Captain <HI>L&mdash;e,</HI> who for this, and other Services, was extreamly well paid, according to the Journal of their own Accounts, which do not run in the ordinary and common Way, of <HI>Debtor, contra Creditor,</HI> but much more conci&s;e, lumping it together, and &s;o carrying the Debt in their Heads, again&s;t the next hone&s;t Trader they meet.</P>
<P>They took at <HI>Calabar,</HI> Captain <HI>Loane,</HI> and two or three <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> Ships, the particulars of all which would be unnece&s;&s;ary Prolixity to enter upon, therefore I come now to give an Account of the U&s;age they received from the Natives of this Place. The <HI>Calabar</HI> Negroes, did not prove &s;o civil, as they expected, for they refu&s;ed to have any Com|merce or Trade with them, when they under|&s;tood they were Pyrates: An Indication that the&s;e poor Creatures, in the narrow Circum|&s;tances they were in, and without the Light of the Go&s;pel, or the Advantage of an Edu|cation, have, notwith&s;tanding, &s;uch a moral in|nate Hone&s;ty, as would upbraid, and &s;hame the mo&s;t knowing Chri&s;tian: But this did but ex|a&s;perate the&s;e lawle&s;s Fellows, and &s;o a Party of 40 Men were detach'd to force a Corre&s;pondence, or drive the Negroes to Extremities; and they accordingly landed under the Fire of their Cannon. The Negroes drew up in a Body of 2000 Men, as if they intended to di&s;pute the Matter with them, and &s;taid till the Pyrates advanced within Pi&s;tol|&s;hot, but finding the Lo&s;s of two or three, made no Impre&s;&s;ion on the re&s;t, the Negroes thought fit to Retreat, which they did with &s;ome Lo&s;s: The
<PB N="200" REF="207">
Pyrates &s;et Fire to the Town, and then return'd to their Ships. This terrified the Negroes, and put an entire &s;top to all the Intercour&s;e between them; &s;o that they could get no Supplies of fre&s;h Provi&s;ions, or any Thing el&s;e, which obliged them, as &s;oon as they had fini&s;hed the cleaning and trim|ing of their Ships, to lo&s;e no Time; &s;o they went for Cape <HI>Lopez,</HI> and watered, and at <HI>Anna Bona,</HI> took aboard a Stock of fre&s;h Provi&s;ions, and then &s;ail'd for the Coa&s;t again.</P>
<P>This was their la&s;t and fatal Expedition, which we &s;hall be more particular in, becau&s;e, it cannot be imagined that they could have had A&s;&s;urance to have undertaken it, but upon a Pre&s;umption, that the Men of War, (who they knew were upon the Coa&s;t,) were unable to attack them.</P>
<P>They fell in with the Coa&s;t as low as Cape <HI>La|h$u,</HI> and even that was higher than they de&s;igned, in the Beginning of <HI>January,</HI> and took the Ship, call'd the <HI>King S$lomon,</HI> with 20 Men in their Boat, and a trading Ve&s;&s;el, both belonging to the Company. The Pyrate Ship happened to fall about a League to Leeward of the <HI>King Solomon,</HI> at Cape <HI>Appollonia,</HI> and the Current and Wind oppo&s;ing their work|ing up with the Ship; they agreed to &s;end the Long-Boat, with a &s;ufficient Number of Men, to take her. The Pyrates are all Voluntiers on the&s;e Occa&s;ions, the Word being always given, <HI>who will go?</HI> And pre&s;ently the &s;tanch and firm Men offer them&s;elves; becau&s;e, by &s;uch Readine&s;s, they re|commend their Courage, and have an Allowance al&s;o of a Shirt of Cloaths, from Head to Foot, out of the Prize.</P>
<P>They r$wed towards the <HI>King Solomon,</HI> with a great deal of A$acrity, and being hail'd by the Commander of her, an&s;wered, <HI>Defiance;</HI> Captain <HI>$Word$,</HI> before this, ob&s;erving a great Number of Men in the Boat, began not to like his Vi|&s;itors,

and prepar'd to receive them, firing a Musket as they came under his Stern, which they return'd with a Volley, and made grea|ter Speed to get on Board: Upon this, he ap|plied to his Men, and ask'd them, whether they would &s;tand by him, to Defend the Ship, it being a Shame they &s;hould be taken by half their Num|ber, without any Repul&s;e? But his Boat&s;wain, <HI>Phi|lips,</HI> took upon him to be the Mouth of the Peo|ple, and put an End to the Di&s;pute; he &s;aid plain|ly, he would not; laid down his Arms in the King's Name, as he was plea&s;ed to Term it, and call'd out to the Boat for Quarters, &s;o that the re&s;t, by his Example, were mi&s;lead to the lo&s;ing of the Ship.</P>
<P>When they came on Board, they brought her under Sail, by an expeditious Method, of cutting the Cable, <HI>Walden</HI> one of the Pyrates, telling the Ma&s;ter, this <HI>yo hope</HI> of heaving up the Anchor, was a needle&s;s trouble, when they de&s;ign'd to burn the Ship. They brought her under Commadore <HI>Roberts</HI>'s Stern, and not only rifled her of what Sails, Cordage, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they wanted for them&s;elves, but wantonly throw'd the Goods of the Company over-board, like Spend|thrifts, that neither expected or de&s;ign'd any account.</P>
<P>On the &s;ame Day al&s;o, they took the <HI>Flu&s;hing,</HI> a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship, robbed her of Ma&s;ts, Yards, and Stores, and then cut down her Fore-Ma&s;t; but what &s;at mo&s;t heavily with the <HI>Skipper,</HI> was, their taking &s;ome very fine Sau&s;ages he had on Board, of his Wife's making, and &s;tringing them, in ludicrous Manner, round their Necks, till they had &s;ufficiently &s;hew'd their Contempt of them, and then threw them into the Sea. Others chopp'd the Heads of his Powls o&s;t, to be dre&s;&s;ed for their Supper, and cour|teou&s;ly invited the Landlord, provided he would find Liquor. It was a melancholly Reque&s;t to the Man, but it mu&s;t be comply'd with, and he was

oblig'd, as they grew drunk, to &s;it quietly, and hear them &s;ing <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Songs, out of his <HI>Dutch</HI> Prayer-Books, with other Prophane&s;s, that he, (tho' a <HI>Dutch</HI> Man,) &s;tood amaz'd at.</P>
<P>In cha&s;ing too near in, they alarm'd the Coa&s;t, and Expre&s;&s;es were &s;ent to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Factories, giving an Account of it: They were &s;en&s;ible of this Error immediately, and, becau&s;e they would make the be&s;t of a bad Market, re&s;ol|ved to keep out of &s;ight of Land, and lo&s;e the Prizes they might expect, between that and <HI>Why|dah,</HI> to make the more &s;ure of that Port, where commonly is the be&s;t Booty; all Nations trading thither, e&s;pecially <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> who Purcha&s;e chiefly with Gold, the Idol their Hearts were bent upon; and notwith&s;tanding this unlikely Cour&s;e, they met, and took, &s;everal Ships, between <HI>Axim</HI> and that Place; the circum&s;tantial Stories of which, and the panick Terrors they &s;truck into his Ma|je&s;ty's Subjects, being tedious and unnece&s;&s;ary to relate, I &s;hall pa&s;s by, and come to their Arrival in that Road.</P>

<P>The Pyrates indeed were obliged to di&s;patch their Bu&s;ine&s;s here, in ha&s;t, becau&s;e they had in|tercepted a Letter from General <HI>Phips,</HI> to Mr. <HI>Bald|win,</HI> the Royal <HI>African</HI> Company's Agent at <HI>Whydah,</HI> (giving an Account, that <HI>Roberts</HI> had been &s;een to Windward of Cape <HI>Three Points,)</HI> that he might the better guard again&s;t the Damages to the Com|pany's Ships, if he &s;hould arrive at that Road before the <HI>Swallow</HI> Man of War, which he a&s;&s;ured him, at the Time of that Letter, was pur&s;uing them to that Place. <HI>Roberts</HI> call'd up his Company, and de&s;ired they would hear <HI>Phips</HI>'s Speech, (for &s;o he was plea&s;ed to call the Letter,) and notwith|&s;tanding their vapouring, per&s;waded them of the Nece&s;&s;ity of moving, for, &s;ays he, <Q>&startq;&s;uch brave Fellows cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to be frightned at this News, yet that it were better to avoid dry Blows, which is the be&s;t that can be expected, if over|taken.&endq;</Q></P>

<P>The <HI>Swallow</HI> and <HI>Weymouth</HI> left <HI>Sierraleon, May</HI> 28, where, I have already taken Notice, <HI>Roberts</HI> arrived about a Month after, and doubtle&s;s learn'd the Intent of their Voyage, and cleaning on the Coa&s;t; which made him &s;et down with more Security to his Diver&s;ion, and furni&s;h him with &s;uch Intima|tions, as made his fir&s;t Range down the Coa&s;t in <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> following, more pro&s;perous; the <HI>Swallow</HI> and <HI>Weymouth,</HI> being then at the Port of <HI>Prince&s;s</HI> a cleaning.</P>
<P>Their &s;tay at <HI>Prince&s;s,</HI> was from <HI>July</HI> 28, to <HI>Sept.</HI> 20 1721. Where, by a Fatality, common to the Ir|regularities of Seamen, (who cannot in &s;uch Ca&s;es be kept under due Re&s;traints,) they buried 100 Men in three Weeks Time, and reduced the Re|mainder of the Ships Companies into &s;o &s;ickly a State, that it was with Difficulty they brought them to Sail; and this Misfortune was the Ruine of <HI>Roberts,</HI> for it prevented the Men of War's going back to <HI>Sierraleon,</HI> as it was intended, for he being acquainted with their De&s;ign of returning, took his Mea&s;ures accordingly; and this Alteration in the Affairs, which obliged them to change their Re&s;olution, not coming to his Knowledge, by that Means he fell into the Mouth of Danger, when he thought him&s;elf the farthe&s;t from it. The <HI>Wey|mouth</HI> being obliged, for want of Hands, to be left at Cape <HI>Cor&s;o,</HI> the two Men of War fell in with the Continent at Cape <HI>Appollonia, October</HI> 20, and there receiv'd the fir&s;t Notice, from one Captain

<P>The <HI>Swallow</HI> having &s;een the <HI>Weymouth</HI> into Cape <HI>Cor&s;o</HI> Road, <HI>November</HI> the 10th, plied to Windward as far as <HI>Ba&s;&s;am,</HI> for what further Intelligence &s;he could gain of the&s;e Pyrates, and to protect the Trade, but every where found it undi&s;turbed, and were, for that Rea&s;on, returning to her Con&s;ort, when accidently meeting a <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Ship, he told her, that the Day before, &s;he &s;aw two Ships Chace into <HI>Junk,</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;el, which &s;he believed mu&s;t have fallen into their Hands. On this Story, the <HI>Swallow</HI> clung her Wind, and endeavoured to gain that Place, but receiving &s;oon after <HI>(Octo.</HI> the 14th,) a contrary Report, from Captain <HI>Plum|mer,</HI> an intelligent Man, in the <HI>Ja&s;on</HI> of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> who had come further to Windward, and neither &s;aw, or heard any Thing of this; &s;he turned her Head downward the &s;econd Time, anchoring at Cape <HI>Appollonia,</HI> the 23d. at Cape <HI>Tres Puntas,</HI> the 27th, and in <HI>Cor&s;o</HI> Road, <HI>January</HI> the 7th, 1721-2.</P>
<P>They learned that their Con&s;ort was, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome Soldiers from the Ca&s;tle, gone to Windward to demand Re&s;titution of &s;ome Goods, or Men, belonging to the Royal <HI>African</HI> Com|pany, that were illegally detained by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> at <HI>Des Minas;</HI> and while they were regretting &s;o long a Separation, an Expre&s;s came to General <HI>Phips,</HI> from <HI>Axim,</HI> the 9th, and followed by another from <HI>Dixcove,</HI> (an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Factory,) with Information that three Ships had cha&s;ed and taken, a Galley nigh <HI>Axim</HI> Ca&s;tle, and a trading Boat belonging
<PB N="207" REF="214">
to the Company: No doubt was made, concerning what they were, it being taken for granted, they were Pyrates; and &s;uppo&s;ed to be the &s;ame that had &s;o lately infe&s;ted the Coa&s;t. The natural Re|&s;ult therefore, from the&s;e two Advices, was to ha&s;ten for <HI>Whydah,</HI> for it was concluded the Prizes he had taken, had informed them how nigh the <HI>Swallow</HI> was, and withal how much better in Health than &s;he had been for &s;ome Months pa&s;t; &s;o that unle&s;s they were very mad indeed, they would (after being di&s;covered) make the be&s;t of their Way for <HI>Whydah,</HI> and &s;ecure the Booty there, without which, their Time and Indu&s;try had been entirely lo&s;t; mo&s;t of the Gold lying in that Corner.</P>
<P>The <HI>Swallow</HI> weighed from Cape <HI>Cor&s;o, January</HI> the 10th, but was retarded by waiting &s;ome Hours on the <HI>Margaret,</HI> the Company's Ship, at <HI>Accra,</HI> on the <HI>Portugal,</HI> and a whole Day at <HI>Apong,</HI> on a Per&s;on whom they generaly u&s;ed to &s;tile <HI>Mi&s;s Betty,</HI> (one of 'Squire <HI>Morrice</HI>'s Ships:) A Conduct that Mr. <HI>Phips</HI> afterwards blamed, altho he had given it as his Opinion, the Pyrates could not be pa&s;&s;ed by, and intimated, their Stay a few Hours would prove no Prejudice.</P>
<P>This, however, hinder'd the <HI>Swallow</HI>'s catching them at <HI>Whydah,</HI> for the Pyrates came in to that Road, with a fre&s;h Gale of Wind, the &s;ame Day the <HI>Swallow</HI> was at Anchor at <HI>Apong,</HI> and &s;ail'd the 13th of <HI>January,</HI> from thence, that &s;he arrived the 17th. She gained Notice of them, by a <HI>French</HI> Shallop from <HI>Grand Papa,</HI> the 14th at Night, and from <HI>Little Papa,</HI> next Morning, by a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship, &s;o that the Man of War, was on all Sides, as they thought, &s;ure of their Purcha&s;e, particularly when they made the Ships, and di&s;covered three of them to get under Sail immediately, at Sight of her, making Signals to one another, as tho' they de&s;ign'd
<PB N="208" REF="215">
a Defence, but they were found to be three <HI>French</HI> Ships; and tho&s;e at Anchor, <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> all hone&s;t Traders, who had been ran&s;ack'd, and ran&s;om'd.</P>
<P>This Di&s;appointment chagreen'd the Ship's Com|pany, who were very intent upon their Market; tho' in all liklyhood, had they met with them in that open Road, one or both would have made their E&s;capes; or if they had thought fit to have fought, their Defence would have been more de&s;|perate together, and they would have been more difficult to have been overcome.</P>
<P>While they were contemplating on the Matter, a Letter was received from Mr. <HI>Baldwin,</HI> (Gover|nor here for the Company,) &s;ignifying, that the Pyrates were at <HI>Jaquin,</HI> &s;even Leagues lower. The <HI>Swallow</HI> weighed at two next Morning, <HI>January</HI> the 16th, and got to <HI>Jaquin</HI> by Day-Light, but to no other End, than frightening the Crews of two <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Ships on Shore, who took her for the Pyrate, that had &s;truck &s;uch Terror at <HI>Whydah:</HI> She returned therefore that Night, and having been &s;trengthen'd with thirty Voluntiers, <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> the di&s;carded Crews of the <HI>Porcupine,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> Ship they had carried from hence. She put to Sea again <HI>January</HI> the 19th, conjecturing, that either <HI>Calabar, Prince&s;s,</HI> the River <HI>Gabone,</HI> Cape <HI>Lopez,</HI> or <HI>Annabona,</HI> mu&s;t be touched at for Water, and Refre&s;hment, tho' they &s;hould re&s;olve to leave the Coa&s;t. As to the former of tho&s;e Places, I have before ob&s;erved, it was hazardous to think of, or rather impracticable; <HI>Prince&s;s</HI> had been a &s;ower Grape to them, but being the fir&s;t in the Way, &s;he came before the Harbour the 29th, where learning no News, the <HI>Swallow,</HI> without lo&s;ing Time, &s;teered for the River <HI>Gabone,</HI> and anchored at the Mouth of it, <HI>February</HI> the 1&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="216">
This River is navigable by two Channels, and has an I&s;land about five Leagues up, call'd <HI>Popaguays,</HI> or <HI>Parrots,</HI> where the <HI>Dutch</HI> Crui&s;ers, for this Coa&s;t, generally Clean, and where &s;ometimes Pyrates come in to look for Prey, or to Re&s;it, it being very convenient, by Rea&s;on of a &s;oft Mud about it, that admits a Ship's lying on Shore, with all her Guns and Stores in, without Damage. Hither Captain <HI>Ogle</HI> &s;ent his Boat and a Lieutenant, who &s;poke with a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship, above the I&s;land, from whom he had this &s;hort Account, <HI>viz.</HI> That he had been four Days from Cape <HI>Lopez,</HI> and had left no Ship there. However, they beat up for the Cape, with|out regard to this Story, and on the 5th, at Dawn|ing, was &s;urprized with the Noi&s;e of a Gun, which as the Day brightened, they found was from Cape <HI>Lopez</HI> Bay; where they di&s;covered three Ships at Anchor, the large&s;t with the King's Colours, and Pendant flying; which was &s;oon concluded to be Mr. <HI>Roberts,</HI> and his Con&s;orts; but the <HI>Swallow</HI> be|ing to windward, and unexpectedly deep in the Bay, were obliged to Steer off, for avoiding a Sand, called, the <HI>French Man's Bank,</HI> which they ob|&s;erving for &s;ome Time, and ra&s;hly interpreting it to be Fear in her, righted the <HI>French Ranger,</HI> which was then on the Heel, and ordered her to Cha&s;e out in all ha&s;t after her, bending &s;everal of their Sails in the Pur&s;uit. The Man of War finding they had fooli&s;hly mi&s;taken her De&s;ign, humour'd the Deceit, and kept off to Sea, as if &s;he had been really afraid, and managed her Steerage &s;o, as to let the <HI>Ranger</HI> come up with her, when they thought they had got &s;o far as not to have their Guns heard by her Con&s;ort at the Cape. The Pyrates had &s;uch an Opinion of their own Courage, that they could never dream, that any Body would u&s;e a Stratagem to &s;peak with them, and &s;o was the more ea&s;ily drawn into the Snare.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="217">
The Pyrates now drew nigh enough to fire their Cha&s;e Guns; they hoi&s;ted the black Flag that was worn in <HI>Whydah</HI> Road, and got their Sprit&s;ail Yard along-&s;hips, with Intent to board; no one having ever asked, all this while, what Country Ship they took the Cha&s;e to be; but they would have her to be a <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> becau&s;e they wanted Sugar for their Punch, and they thought of nothing el&s;e. It was with the utmo&s;t Con&s;ternation, they &s;aw her bring too, and hawl up their lower Ports, now within Pi&s;tol-Shot, and &s;truck their black Flag up|on it directly; tho' after the fir&s;t Surprize was over, they kept firing at a Di&s;tance, hoi&s;ted it again, and vapoured with their Cutla&s;hes on the Poop, tho' they endeavoured to run away. Being now at their Wits end, boarding was propo&s;ed by the Heads of them, and &s;o to make one de&s;perate Pu&s;h; but the Motion not being well &s;econded, and their Main-Top-Ma&s;t coming down by a Shot, after two Hours firing, it was declined; they grew Sick, &s;truck their Colours, and called out for Quarters; having had 10 Men killed out right, and 20 wound|ed, without the lo&s;s or hurt of one of the King's Men. She had 32 Guns, mann'd with 16 <HI>French</HI> Men, 20 Negroes, and 77 <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>While the <HI>Swallow</HI> was &s;ending their Boat to fetch the Pri&s;oners, a Bla&s;t and Smoak, was &s;een to pour out of the great Cabin, and they thought they were blowing up; but upon enquiry afterwards found, that half a dozen of the mo&s;t De&s;perate, when they &s;aw all hopes fled, had drawn them|&s;elves round what Powder they had left, in the Steerage, and fired a Pi&s;tol into it, but it was too &s;mall a Quantity to effect any Thing more, than burning them in a frightful Manner.</P>
<P>This Ship was commanded by one <HI>Skyrme,</HI> a <HI>Welch</HI> Man, who, tho' he had lo&s;t his Leg in the Action, would not &s;uffer him&s;elf to be dre&s;&s;ed, or

The re&s;t appeared gay and brisk, mo&s;t of them with white Shirts, Watches, and a deal of Silk Ve&s;ts, but the Gold-Du&s;t belonging to them, was mo&s;t of it in the little <HI>Ranger,</HI> left in the Bay with the <HI>Royal Fortune;</HI> &s;o that not above 300 l. come out of her. They then enquired for the Colours, but found they were thrown over|board, I &s;uppo&s;e, from a Fancy they would be di&s;|play'd, in a of kind Triumph, over them.</P>
<P>They &s;ecured the Pri&s;oners with Pinions, and Shackles, but the Ship was &s;o much di&s;abled in the Engagement, that they had once Thoughts to &s;et her on Fire; but as this would have given them the trouble of taking the Pyrates wounded Men on Board them&s;elves, and that they were certain the <HI>Royal Fortune</HI> would wait for their Return, they lay by her two Days, repaired her Rigging and other Damages, and &s;ent her into <HI>Prince&s;s,</HI> with the <HI>French</HI> Men, and four of their own Hands.</P>
<P>On the 9th in the Evening, the <HI>Swallow</HI> gained the Cape again, and &s;aw the <HI>Royal Fortune</HI> &s;tanding into the Bay with the <HI>Neptune,</HI> Captain <HI>Hill,</HI> of <HI>London:</HI> A good Pre&s;age of the next Days Succe&s;s, for they did not doubt but the Temptation of Liquor, and Plunder, they might find in this their new Prize, would make the Pyrates very confu&s;ed; and &s;o it hap|pened.</P>
<P>On the 10th, in the Morning, the Man of War bore away to round the Cape. <HI>Robert</HI>'s Crew di&s;|cerning their Ma&s;ts over the Land, went down into the Cabin; to acquaint him of it, he being then at Breakfa&s;t with his new Gue&s;t, Captain <HI>Hill,</HI> on a &s;avory Di&s;h of Solomongundy, and &s;ome of his own Beer.

and were merrily debating for &s;ome Time, on the Manner of Reception, whether they &s;hould &s;alute, or not; but as the <HI>Swallow</HI> approach'd nigher, Things appeared plainer, and tho' they were &s;tigmatiz'd with the Name of Cowards, who &s;hewed any apprehen&s;ion of Danger; yet &s;ome of them now undeceived, declared it to <HI>Roberts,</HI> e|pecially one <HI>Arm&s;trong,</HI> who had de&s;erted from that Ship, and knew her well: Tho&s;e <HI>Roberts</HI> &s;wore at as Cowards, who meant to di&s;hearten the Men, asking them if it were &s;o, whether they were afraid to fight, or no? And hardly refrained from Blows. What his own Apprehen&s;ions were, till &s;he hawl|ed up her Ports, and hoi&s;ted their proper Colours, is uncertain; but then being perfectly convinced, he &s;lipped his Cable, got under Sail, and ordered his Men to Arms, without any &s;hew of Timidity, dropping a fir&s;t Rath Oath, <HI>that it was a Bite, but, at the &s;ame Time, re&s;olved, like a gallant Rogue, to get clear, or die.</HI></P>
<P>There was one <HI>Arm&s;trong,</HI> as I ju&s;t mention'd, a De&s;erter from the <HI>Swallow,</HI> whom they enquired of concerning the Trim and &s;ailing of that Ship; he told them &s;he &s;ail'd be&s;t upon a Wind, and therefore, if they de&s;igned to leave her, they &s;hould go before it.</P>
<P>The Danger was imminent, and Time very &s;hort, to con&s;ult of Means to extricate him&s;elf; his Re&s;o|lution in this Streight, was as follows: To Pa&s;s clo&s;e to the <HI>Swallow,</HI> with all their Sails, and receive her Broad&s;ide, before they returned a Shot; if di&s;abled by this, or that they could not depend on &s;ailing, then to run on Shore at the Point, (which is &s;teep to,) and every one to &s;hift for him&s;elf among the Negroes; or failing in the&s;e, to board, and blow up together, for he &s;aw the greate&s;t part of his Men drunk, pa&s;&s;ively Couragious, unfit for Service.</P>

<HI>Roberts</HI> him&s;elf made a gallant Figure, at the Time of the Engagement, being dre&s;&s;ed in a rich crim&s;on Damask Wa&s;tcoat, and Breeches, a red Feather in his Hat, and a Gold Chain ten Times round his Neck, a Sword in his Hand, and two pair of Pi&s;tols hanging at the End of a Silk Sling, which was flung over his Shoulders (according to the Fa&s;hion of the Pyrates;) and is &s;aid to have given his Orders with Boldne&s;s, and Spirit; com|ing, according to what he had purpo&s;ed, clo&s;e to the Man of War, received her Fire, and then hoi&s;ted his Black Flag, and returned it, &s;hoot|ing away from her, with all the Sail he could pack; and had he took <HI>Arm&s;trong</HI>'s Advice, to have gone before the Wind, he had probably e&s;caped; but keeping his Tacks down, either by the Winds &s;hifting, or ill Steerage, or both, he was taken a-back with his Sails, and the <HI>Swallow</HI> came a &s;econd Time very nigh to him: He had now perhaps fini&s;hed the Fight very de&s;peratly, if Death who took a &s;wift Pa&s;&s;age, in a Grape-Shot, had not inter|po&s;ed, and &s;truck him directly on the Throat. He &s;ettled him&s;elf on the Tackles of a Gun, which one <HI>Stephen&s;on,</HI> from the Helm, ob&s;erving, ran to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and not perceiving him wounded, &s;wore at him, and bid him &s;tand up, and fight like a Man; but when he found his Mi&s;take, and that his Captain was certainly dead, he gu&s;hed into Tears, and wi&s;hed the next Shot might be his Lot. They pre&s;ently threw him over-board, with his Arms, and Ornaments on, according to the repeat|ed Reque&s;t, he had made in his Life-time.</P>
<P><HI>Roberts</HI> was a tall black Man, near forty Years of Age, born at <HI>Newey-bagh,</HI> nigh <HI>Haverford-We&s;t,</HI> in <HI>Pembrok&s;hire,</HI> of good natural Parts, and per&s;onal Bravery, tho' he applied them to &s;uch wicked Purpo&s;es, as made them of no Commendation, fre|quently drinking <HI>D&mdash;n to him who ever lived to</HI>

<P>The <HI>Swallow</HI> returned back into Cape <HI>Lopez</HI> Bay, and found the little <HI>Ranger,</HI> whom the Pyrates had de&s;erted in ha&s;t, for the better Defence of the Ship: She had been plundered, according to what I could learn, of 2000 l. in Gold-Du&s;t, (the Shares of tho&s;e who belonged to her;) and Captain <HI>Hill,</HI> in the <HI>Neptune,</HI> taken the Day before the Action, by <HI>Roberts,</HI> was &s;o ju&s;t as to return (unasked) to the Value of 50 Ounces, at <HI>Barbadoes.</HI></P>

To Sum up the whole, if it be con&s;idered, fir&s;t, that the Sickly State of the Men of War, when they &s;ail'd from <HI>Prince&s;s,</HI> was the Misfortune that hin|dered their being as far as <HI>Sierraleon,</HI> and con&s;e|quently out of the Track they then took.

<P>So that to &s;ecure them&s;elves again&s;t any mad de&s;perate Undertaking of their's, they &s;trongly barricado'd the Gun-Room, and made another Pri|&s;on before it; an Officer, with Pi&s;tols and Cut|la&s;hes, doing Duty, Night and Day, and the Pri|&s;oners within, manacled and &s;hackled.</P>

<P>A Combination, and Con&s;piracy was formed, be|twixt <HI>Moody, A&s;hplant, Magnes, Mare,</HI> and others, to ri&s;e, and kill the Officers, and run away with the Ship. This they had carried on by Means of a Mulatto Boy, who was allowed to attend them, and prov'd very tru&s;ty in his Me&s;&s;ages, between the Principals; but the Evening of that Night they were to have made this Struggle, two of the Pri&s;oners that &s;at next to <HI>A&s;hplant,</HI> heard the Boy whi&s;per him upon the Project, and naming to him the Hour they &s;hould be ready, pre&s;ently gave Notice of it to the Captain, which put the Ship in an Alarm, for a little Time; and, on Examina|tion, &s;everal of them had made &s;hift to break off, or lo&s;e their Shackles, (no doubt for &s;uch purpo&s;e;) but it tended only to procure to them&s;elves wor&s;e U&s;age and Confinement.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame Pa&s;&s;age to Cape <HI>Cor&s;o,</HI> the Prize, <HI>Royal Fortune,</HI> was in the &s;ame Danger. She was

left at the I&s;land of St. <HI>Thomas</HI>'s, in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an Officer, and a few Men, to take in &s;ome fre&s;h Provi&s;ions,) which were &s;carce at Cape <HI>Cor&s;o,)</HI> with Orders to follow the Ship. There were only &s;ome of the Pyrate's Negroes, three or four wound|ed Pri&s;oners, and <HI>Scudamore,</HI> their Surgeon; from whom their &s;eemed to be under no Apprehen&s;ion, e&s;|pecially from the la&s;t, who might have hoped for Favour, on Account of his Employ; and had &s;tood &s;o much indebted for his Liberty, eating and drinking con&s;tantly with the Officer; yet this Fellow, regardle&s;s of the Favour, and lo&s;t to all Sen&s;e of Reformation, endeavoured to bring over the Negroes to his De&s;ign of murdering the Peo|ple, and running away with the Ship. He ea&s;ily prevailed with the Negroes to come into the De|&s;ign; but when he came to communicate it to his Fellow Pri&s;oners, and would have drawn them into the &s;ame Mea&s;ures, by telling them, he under&s;tood Navigation, that the Negroes were &s;tout Fellows, and by a &s;mattering he had in the <HI>Angolan</HI> Lan|guage, he had found willing to undertake &s;uch an Enterprize; and that it was better venturing to do this, run down the Coa&s;t, and rai&s;e a new Company, than to proceed to Cape <HI>Cor&s;o,</HI> and be hang'd like a Dog, and Sun dry'd. One of them abhoring the Cruelty, or fearing the Succe&s;s, di&s;covered it to the Officer, who made him immediately a Pri|&s;oner, and brought the Ship &s;afe.</P>
<P>When they came to be lodg'd in Cape <HI>Cor&s;o-Ca&s;tle,</HI> their Hopes of this kind all cut off, and that they were a&s;&s;ured they mu&s;t there &s;oon receive a final Sentence; the Note was changed among mo&s;t of them, and from vain in&s;olent je&s;ting, they became &s;erious and devout, begging for good Books, and joining in publick Prayers, and &s;inging of P&s;alms, twice at lea&s;t every Day.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="225">
We think it unnece&s;&s;ary to burthen the Readers with the particular Tryals, which we are &s;en&s;ible in their Nature, mu&s;t grow tire&s;ome and flat, like Se&s;&s;ions Papers, the Repetition of the &s;ame &s;ort of Evidence and Defence, over, and over again; I &s;hall therefore give a few of the mo&s;t re|markable, with Ob&s;ervations on the dying Beha|viour of &s;uch of them, as came to my Knowledge.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, it may be ob&s;erved from the Li&s;t, that a great Part of the&s;e Pyrate Ships Crews, were Men entered on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI> not many Months before they were taken; from whence, it may be concluded, that the pretended Con&s;traint of <HI>Roberts,</HI> on them, was very often a Complotment between Parties equally willing: And this <HI>Roberts</HI> &s;everal Times openly declared, particularly to the <HI>On&s;low</HI>'s People, whom he call|ed aft, and ask'd of them, <HI>who was willing to go, for he would force no Body?</HI> As was depo&s;ed, by &s;ome of his be&s;t Hands, after Aquittal; nor is it rea&s;onable to think, he &s;hould reject <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Voluntiers, only from a pique again&s;t <HI>Kennedy,</HI> and force others that might hazard, and, in Time, de&s;troy his Go|vernment: But their Behaviour &s;oon put him out of this Fear, and convinc'd him, that the Plea of Force was only the be&s;t Artifice they had to &s;helter them&s;elves under; in Ca&s;e they &s;hould be taken, and that they were le&s;s Rogues than others, only in Point of Time.</P>
<P>It may likewi&s;e be taken Notice of, that the Country, wherein they happened to be tried, is among other Happine&s;&s;es, exempted from Law|vers, and Law-Books, &s;o that the Office of Regi|&s;ter, of nece&s;&s;ity fell on one, not ver&s;ed in tho&s;e Affairs, which might plead for want of Form, and ju&s;tify the Court, who neverthele&s;s voted with Integrity and Impartiality.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="226">
But, perhaps, if there was le&s;s Law, their might be more Ju&s;tice, than in &s;ome other Courts; for, if the civil Law be that Law of univer&s;al Rea&s;on, judging of the Rectitude, or Iniquity, of Men's Actions, every Man of common Sen&s;e is endued with a Portion of it, at lea&s;t &s;ufficient to make him di&s;tingui&s;h Right from Wrong, or what the Civilians call, <HI>Malum in &s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore, here, if two Per&s;ons were equally Guilty of the &s;ame Fact, there was no convicting one, and bringing the other off, by any Quirk, or turn of Law; for they form'd their Judgments upon the Con&s;traint, or Willingne&s;s, the Aim, and Intention, of the Parties, and all other Circum|&s;tances, which make a material Difference. Be&s;ides, in Crimes of this Nature, Men bred up to the Sea, mu&s;t be more knowing, and much abler, than others more learned in the Law; for, before a Man can have a right Idea of a Thing, he mu&s;t, know the Terms &s;tanding for that Thing: The Sea-Terms being a Language by it &s;elf, which no Law|yer can be &s;uppo&s;ed to under&s;tand; he mu&s;t of Con&s;equence, want that di&s;criminating Faculty, which &s;hould direct him to judge right of the Facts meant by tho&s;e Terms.</P>
<P>The Court well knew, it was not po&s;&s;ible to get the Evidence of every Sufferer by this Crew, and therefore, fir&s;t of all, con&s;idered how that Deficien|cy &s;hould be &s;upplied; whether, or no, they could pardon one <HI>Jo. Dennis,</HI> who had early offered him|&s;elf, as King's Evidence, and was the be&s;t read in their Lives and Conver&s;ations: Here indeed, they were at a lo&s;s for Law, and concluded in the Negative, lo&s;ing by it, tho&s;e great Helps he could have afforded.</P>
<P>Another great Difficulty in their Proceedings, was how to under&s;tand tho&s;e Words in the Act of Parliament, of, <HI>particularly &s;pecifying in the Charge, the</HI>
<PB N="220" REF="227">
<HI>Circum&s;tances of Time, Place,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>i. e.</HI> &s;o to under|&s;tand them, as to be able to hold a Court; for if they had been indicted on particular Robberies, the Evidence had happened mo&s;tly from the Royal <HI>African</HI> Company's Ships, on which the&s;e Gentle|men of Cape <HI>Cor&s;o-Ca&s;tle,</HI> were not qualify'd to &s;it, their Oath running, <HI>That they have no Intere&s;t directly, or indirectly, in the Ship, or Goods, for the Robbery of which, the Party &s;tands accu&s;ed:</HI> And this they thought they had, Commi&s;&s;ions being paid them, on &s;uch Goods: And on the other Side, if they were in|capacitated, no Court could be formed, the Commi|&s;&s;ion ab&s;olutely requiring three of them by Name.</P>
<P>To reconcile all Things, therefore, the Court re&s;olved, to bottom the whole of their Proceedings on the <HI>Swallow</HI>'s Depo&s;itions, which were clear and plain, and had the Circum&s;tance of Time when, Place where, Manner how, and the like, particu|larly &s;pecified according to the Statute in that Ca&s;e made, and provided. But this admitted only a general Intimation of Robbery, in the Indictment, therefore <HI>to approve their Clemency,</HI> it looking Arbitrary on the Lives of Men, to lump them to the Gallows, in &s;uch a &s;ummary Way as mu&s;t have been done, had they &s;olely adhered to the <HI>Swallow</HI>'s Charge, they re&s;olved to come to particular Tryals.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>That the Pri&s;oners might not be Ignorant whereon to An&s;wer,</HI> and &s;o have all fair Advantages, to excu&s;e and defend them&s;elves; which mu&s;t re|commend the Ju&s;tice, and Integrity, of the Court, who heard, with all Patience, any Evidence that could be brought, to weaken or coroborate the three Circum&s;tances that compleat a Pyrate; fir&s;t, being a Voluntier among&s;t them at fir&s;t; &s;econdly, being a Voluntier at the taking or robbing of any Ship, or la&s;tly; voluntarily accepting a Share in the Booty of tho&s;e that did; for by a Parity of Rea&s;on, where the&s;e Actions were of their own

<P><HI>For that, on the 5th of</HI> February, <HI>la&s;t pa&s;t, upon &s;ight of the afore&s;aid King's Ship, ye did immediately weigh Anchor from under Cape</HI> Lopez, <HI>on the Southern Coa&s;t of</HI> Africa, <HI>in a</HI> French <HI>built Ship of</HI> 32 <HI>Guns, called the</HI> Ranger, <HI>and did Pur&s;ue, and Cha&s;e the afore&s;aid King's Ship, with &s;uch Di&s;patch and Precipitancy, as declared ye common Robbers, and Pyrates.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That about ten of the Clock the &s;ame Morning, drawing within Gun-&s;hot of his Maje&s;ty's afore&s;aid Ship, the</HI> Swal|low, <HI>ye hoi&s;ted a pyratical black Flag, and fired &s;everal</HI>
<PB N="225" REF="232">
<HI>Chace Guns, to deter as much as ye were able, his Maje&s;ty's Servants from their Duty.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That an Hour after this, being very nigh to the afore|&s;aid King's Ship, ye did audaciou&s;ly continue in a ho|&s;tile Defence and A&s;&s;ault, for about two Hours more, in open Violation of all Laws, and in Defiance of the King's Colours, and Commi&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And la&s;tly, that in the acting, and compa&s;&s;ing of all this, ye were all and every one of you, in a wicked Combina|tion, voluntarily to exert, and actually did, in your &s;everal Stations, u&s;e your utmo&s;t Endeavours, to di&s;tre&s;s the &s;aid King's Ship, and murder his Maje&s;ty's good Subjects.</HI></P>
<P>To which they &s;everally pleaded, <HI>Not Guilty.</HI></P>
<P>Then the Court called for the Officers of the <HI>Swallow,</HI> Mr. <HI>I&s;aac Sun,</HI> Lieutenant, <HI>Ralph Baldrick,</HI> Boat&s;wain, <HI>Daniel Maclaughlin,</HI> Mate, de&s;iring them to view the Pri&s;oners, whether they knew them? And to give an Account in what Manner they had attack'd, and fought the King's Ship; and they agreed as follows.</P>
<P>That they had viewed all the Pri&s;oners, as they &s;tood now before the Court, and were a&s;&s;ured they were the &s;ame taken out of one, or other, of the Pyrate Ships, <HI>Royal Fortune,</HI> or <HI>Ranger;</HI> but verily believe them to be tho&s;e taken out of the <HI>Ranger.</HI></P>
<P>That they did in the King's Ship, at break of Day, on <HI>Monday,</HI> the 5th of <HI>February,</HI> 1721-2, di&s;|cover three Ships at Anchor, under Cape <HI>Lopez,</HI> on the Southern Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa;</HI> the Cape bear|ing then, W. S. W. about three Leagues, and perceiving one of them to have a Pendant flying, and having heard their Morning-Gun before, they immediately &s;u&s;pected them to be, <HI>Roberts</HI> the Py|rate, his Con&s;ort, and a <HI>French</HI> Ship, they knew had been lately carried out of <HI>Whydah</HI> Road.</P>
<P>The King's Ship was obliged to hawl off N. W. and W. N. W. to avoid a Sand called, the
<PB N="226" REF="233">
<HI>French Man's Bank,</HI> the Wind then at S. S. E. and found in half an Hours-Time, one of the three had got under Sail from the Careen, and was bend|ing her Sails, in a Chace towards them. To encou|rage this Ra&s;hne&s;s and Precipitancy, they kept away before the Wind, (as tho' afraid,) but with their Tacks on Board, their Main-Yard braced, and making, at the &s;ame Time, very bad Steerage.</P>
<P>About half an Hour after ten, in the Morning, the Pyrate Ship came within Gun-&s;hot, and fired four Chace Guns, hoi&s;ted a black Flag at the Mizen-Peek, and got their Sprit-&s;ail Yard under their Bow-&s;prit, for boarding. In half an Hour more, approaching &s;till nigher, they Starboarded their Helm, and gave her a Broad&s;ide, the Pyrate bringing too, and returning the &s;ame.</P>
<P>After this, the Deponents &s;ay, their Fire grew &s;lack for &s;ome Time, becau&s;e the Pyrate was &s;hot &s;o far a Head on the Weather-Bow, that few of their Guns could Point to her; yet in this In|terval their black Flag was either Shot away, or hawled down, a little Space, and hoi&s;ted again.</P>
<P>At length, by their ill Steerage, and favour of the Wind, they came near, a &s;econd Time; and about two in the Afternoon, &s;hot away their Main|topma&s;t.</P>
<P>The Colours they &s;ought under, be&s;ides a black Flag,) were a red <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> En&s;ign, a King's Jack, and a <HI>Dutch</HI> Pendant, which they &s;truck at, or about, three in the Afternoon, and called for Quarters; it proving to be a <HI>French</HI> built Ship of 32 Guns, called the <HI>Ranger.</HI></P>
<P>I&s;aac Sun,</P>
<P>Ralph Baldrick,</P>
<P>Daniel Maclauglin.</P>
<P>When the Evidence had been heard, the Pri&s;o|ners were called upon to an&s;wer, how they came
<PB N="227" REF="234">
on Board this Pyrate Ship; and their Rea&s;on for &s;o audacious a Re&s;i&s;tance, as hath been made again&s;t the King's Ship.</P>
<P>To this, each, in his Reply, owned him&s;elf to be one of tho&s;e taken out of the <HI>Ranger;</HI> that he had &s;igned their pyratical Articles, and &s;hared in their Plunder, &s;ome few only excepted, who had been there too &s;hort a Time. But that neither in this &s;igning, or &s;haring, nor in the Re&s;i&s;tance had been made again&s;t his Maje&s;ty's Ship, had they been Voluntiers, but had acted in the&s;e &s;everal Parts, from a Terror of Death; which by a Law among&s;t them, was to be the Portion of tho&s;e who refu&s;ed. The Court then ask'd, who made tho&s;e Laws? How tho&s;e Guns came to be fired? Or why they had not de&s;erted their Stations, and mutinied, when &s;o fair a Pro&s;pect of Redemption offered? They replied &s;till, with the &s;ame An&s;wers, and could extenuate their Crimes, with no other Plea, than being forced Men. Wherefore the Court were of Opinion, that the Indictment, as it charg|ed them with an unlawful Attack and Re&s;i&s;tance, of the King's Ship, was &s;ufficiently proved; but then it being undeniably evident, that many of the&s;e Pri&s;oners had been forced, and &s;ome of them of very &s;hort &s;tanding, they did, on mature De|liberation, come to this merciful Re&s;olution.</P>
<P>That they would hear further Evidence for, or again&s;t, each Per&s;on &s;ingly, in relation to tho&s;e Parts of the Indictment, which declared them Voluntiers, or charged them with aiding and a&s;&s;i&s;ting, at the burning, &s;inking, or robbing of other Ships; for if they acted, or a&s;&s;i&s;ted, in any Robberies, or Deva&s;tations, it would be a Conviction they were Voluntiers; here &s;uch Evidence, tho it might want the Form, &s;till carried the Rea&s;on of the Law with it.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="235">
The Charge was exhibited, al&s;o again&s;t the follow|ing Pyrates taken out of the <HI>Royal Fortune.</HI></P>

<P><HI>YE, and every one of you, are, in the Name, and by the Authority of our mo&s;t dread Sovereign Lord</HI> George, <HI>King of</HI> Great Britain, <HI>indicated as follows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fora&s;much as in open Contempt, and Violation of the Laws of your Country, (to which ye ought to have been Sub|ject,) ye have all of you, been wickedly united and arti|ced together, for the Annoyance and De&s;truction of his Maje&s;ty's trading Subjects by Sea, and in Conformity to &s;o wicked an Agreement, and A&s;&s;ociation: Ye have twice lately been down this Coa&s;t of</HI> Africa, <HI>once in</HI> Augu&s;t, <HI>and a &s;econd Time in</HI> January <HI>la&s;t, &s;poiling and de&s;troy|ing many Goods and Ve&s;&s;els, of his Maje&s;ty's Subjects, and other trading Nations.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Particularly ye &s;tand indicted at the Information and In&s;tance of Captain</HI> Chal$ner Ogle, <HI>as Traytors, Rob|bers, Pyrates, and common Enemies to Mankind.</HI></P>
<P><HI>For that on the 10th of</HI> February <HI>la&s;t, in a Ship ye were po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of, called the</HI> Royal Fortune, <HI>of</HI> 40 <HI>Guns, ye did maintain a ho&s;tile Defence and Re&s;i&s;tance, for &s;ome Hours, again&s;t his Maje&s;ty's Ship the</HI> Swallow, <HI>nigh Cape</HI> Lopez <HI>Bay, on the Southern Coa&s;t of</HI> Africa.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="238">
<HI>That this Fight, and in&s;olent Re&s;i&s;tance, again&s;t the King's Ship, was made, not only without any Pretence of Authority, more than that of your own private depraved Wills, but was done al&s;o under a black Flag, flagrantly by that, denoting your &s;elves common Robbers, and Traitors, Oppo&s;ers, and Violators of the Laws.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And la&s;tly, that in this Re&s;i&s;tance, ye were all of you Voluntiers, and did, as &s;uch, contribute your utmo&s;t Ef|forts, for di&s;abling and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the afore&s;aid King's Ship, and deterring his Maje&s;ty's Servants therein, from their Duty.</HI></P>
<P>To which they &s;everally pleaded, <HI>Not Guilty.</HI></P>
<P>Whereupon, the Officers of his Maje&s;ty's Ship, the <HI>Swallow,</HI> were called again, and te&s;tify'd as follows.</P>
<P>That they had &s;een all the Pri&s;oners now before the Court, and knew them to be the &s;ame which were taken out of one or other of the Pyrate Ships, <HI>Royal Fortune,</HI> or <HI>Ranger,</HI> but verily believe them, to be tho&s;e taken out of the <HI>Royal Fortune.</HI></P>
<P>That the Pri&s;oners were po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of a Ship of 40 Guns, call'd the <HI>Royal Fortune,</HI> and were at an Anchor under Cape <HI>Lopez,</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI> with two others: When his Maje&s;ty's Ship the <HI>Swallow,</HI> (to which the Deponents belong'd, and were Officers,) &s;tood in for the Place on <HI>Saturday,</HI> the 10th of <HI>February,</HI> 1721-2. the large&s;t had a Jack, En&s;ign, and Pendant flying, (being this <HI>Royal For|tune,)</HI> who on Sight of them, had their Boats pa&s;&s;ing, and repa&s;&s;ing, from the other two, which they &s;uppo&s;ed to be with Men; the Wind not favouring the afore&s;aid King's Ship, &s;he was oblig|ed to make two Trips, to gain nigh enough the Wind, to fetch in with the Pyrate; and being at length little more than random Shot from them, they found &s;he &s;lipped her Cable, and got under Sail.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="239">
At eleven, the Pyrate was within Pi&s;tol-Shot, a brea&s;t of them, with a black Flag, and Pendant hoi&s;ted at their Main-topma&s;t Head. The Depo|nents &s;ay, they then &s;truck the <HI>French</HI> En&s;ign, that had continued hoi&s;ted at their Staff all the Morn|ing till then; and di&s;play'd the King's Colours, giving her, at the &s;ame Time, their Broad&s;ide, which was immediately returned.</P>
<P>The Pyrate's Mizen-topma&s;t fell, and &s;ome of her Rigging was torn, yet &s;he &s;till out &s;ail'd the Man of War, and &s;lid half Gun-Shot from them, while they continued to Fire, without Intermi&s;&s;ion, and the other to return &s;uch Guns, as could be brought to bear, till by favour of the Winds, they were advanced very nigh again; and after exchanging a few more Shot, about half an Hour pa&s;t one, his Main-Ma&s;t came down, having received a Shot a little below the Parrel.</P>
<P>At two, &s;he &s;truck her Colours, and call'd for Quarters, proving to be a Ship, formerly called the <HI>On&s;low,</HI> but by them, the <HI>Royal Fortune;</HI> and the Pri&s;oners from her, a&s;&s;ured them, that the &s;malle&s;t Ship of the two, then remaining in the Road, belonged to them, by the Name of the <HI>little Ran|ger,</HI> which they had de&s;erted on this Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I&s;aac Sun,</P>
<P>Ralph Baldrick,</P>
<P>Daniel Maclauglin.</P>

<P>IT appeared by the Evidence of Captain <HI>Jo.

<P>When the Boat drew nigh, (they &s;ay) it was judged from the Number of Men in her, that they were Pyrates, and being hailed, an&s;wer'd, <HI>Defiance;</HI> at which the Commander &s;natch'd a Mu&s;quet from one of his Men, and fired, asking them at the &s;ame Time, whether they would &s;tand by him, to defend the Ship? But the Pyrates returning a Vol|ley, and crying out, they would give no Quarters if any Re&s;i&s;tance was made, this Pri&s;oner took upon him to call out for Quarters, without the Ma&s;ter's Con&s;ent, and mi&s;lead the re&s;t, to laying down their Arms, and giving up the Ship, to half the Number of Men, and in an open Boat. It was
<PB N="234" REF="241">
further evident he became, after this, a Voluntier among&s;t them. Fir&s;t, becau&s;e he was pre&s;ently very forward and brisk, in robbing the Ship, <HI>King Solomon,</HI> of her Provi&s;ions and Stores. Secondly, becau&s;e he endeavoured to have his Captain ill u&s;ed; and la&s;tly, becau&s;e he had confe&s;s'd to <HI>Fenn,</HI> that he had been obliged to &s;ign their Articles that Night, (a Pi&s;tol being laid on the Table, to &s;igni|fy, he mu&s;t do it, or be Shot,) when the whole appeared to be an Untruth from other Evidence, who al&s;o a&s;&s;erted, his being armed, in the Action again&s;t the <HI>Swallow.</HI></P>
<P>In an&s;wer to this, he fir&s;t ob&s;erved upon the Un|happine&s;s of being friendle&s;s in this Part of the World, which, el&s;ewhere, by witne&s;&s;ing to the Ho|ne&s;ty of his former Life, would, he believed, in a great Mea&s;ure, have invalidated the wrong Evi|dence had been given, of his being a Voluntier with the Pyrates. He owns indeed, he made no Applica|tion to his Captain, to intercede for a Di&s;charge, but excu&s;es it with &s;aying, he had a di&s;like to him, and therefore was &s;ure that &s;uch Application would have avail'd him nothing.</P>
<P>The Court ob&s;erved the Pretences of this, and other of the Pyrates, of a Pi&s;tol, and their Arti|cles, being &s;erved up in a Di&s;h together, or of their being mi&s;u&s;ed and forced from an hone&s;t Service, was often a Complotment of the Parties, to ren|der them le&s;s &s;u&s;pected of tho&s;e they came from, and was to an&s;wer the End of being put in a News-Paper, or Affidavit: And the Pyrates were &s;o ge|nerous as not to refu&s;e a Compliment to a Brother that co&s;t them nothing, and, at the &s;ame Time, &s;ecured them the be&s;t Hands; the be&s;t, I call them, becau&s;e &s;uch a Dependance made them act more boldly. <HI>Guilty.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Jo.

<P><HI>James White,</HI> who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s was Mu&s;ick, and was on the Poop of the Pyrate Ship in Time of Action with the <HI>Swallow,</HI> depo&s;ed, that during the Engage|ment, and Defence &s;he made, he never &s;aw the Pri|&s;oner bu&s;ied about the Guns, or giving Orders either to the loading, or firing of them; but that he wholly attended to the &s;etting, or triming, of the Sails, as <HI>Roberts</HI> commanded; and that in the Conclu&s;ion, he verily believed him to be the Man who prevented the Ships being blown up, by &s;etting tru&s;ty Centinels below, and oppo&s;ing him&s;elf again&s;t &s;uch hot headed Fellows, as had procured lighted Matches, and were going down for that Purpo&s;e.</P>

<PB N="237" REF="244">
thinks he rendered all the Service in his Power, for preventing it; in particular, he under&s;tood by all Hands, that he had-&s;eized, and taken, from one <HI>James Philips,</HI> a lighted Match, at the In&s;tant he was going down to the Magazine, &s;wearing, that that &s;hould &s;end them all to H&mdash;l together.

<P>The Pri&s;oner in his own Defence, &s;ays, when he had the Misfortune of falling into the Pyrates Hands, he was chief Mate of the <HI>Samuel,</HI> of <HI>Lon|don,</HI> Captain <HI>Cary,</HI> and when he had hid him&s;elf, to prevent the De&s;ign of carrying him away, they found him, and beat and threw him over-board. Seven Days afterwards, upon his objecting again&s;t, and refu&s;ing to &s;ign their Articles, he was cut and abu|&s;ed again: That tho' after this, he ingratiated him|&s;elf, by a more humble Carriage, it was only to make Life ea&s;y; the Shares they had given him, having been from Time to Time returned again, to &s;uch Pri|&s;oners as fell in his Way; till of late indeed, he had made a &s;mall Re&s;ervation, and had de&s;ired Captain <HI>Loan,</HI> to take two or three Moidores from him, to car|ry to his Wife. He was once taken, he &s;ays, at ma|king his E&s;cape, in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and with two more &s;entenced to be Shot for it, by a drunken Jury; the latter actually &s;uffered, and he was pre|&s;erved only by one of the chief Pyrates taking a &s;udden liking to him, and bullying the others. A &s;econd Time he ran away at <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> carrying a Pocket Compa&s;s, for conducting him through the Woods, but that being a mo&s;t de&s;olate, and wild Part of the I&s;land he fell upon, and he igno|rant how to direct his Cour&s;e, was obliged after two or three Days wandering, to return towards the
<PB N="238" REF="245">
Ship again, denying with egregious Oaths, the De|&s;ign he was charged with, for Fear they &s;hould &s;hoot him. From this Time he hopes it will be &s;ome Extenuation of his Fault, that mo&s;t of the acquitted Pri&s;oners can Witne&s;s, they entertained Jealou&s;ies of him, and <HI>Roberts</HI> would not admit him into his Secrets; and withal, that Captain <HI>Cary,</HI> (and four other Pa&s;&s;engers with him) had made Affidavit, of his having been forced from his Em|ploy, which tho' he could not produce, yet he humbly hoped, the Court would think highly pro|bable from the Circum&s;tances offered.</P>
<P>On the whole, the Court was of Opinion, Ar|ti&s;ts had the be&s;t Preten&s;ion to the Plea of Force, from the Nece&s;&s;ity Pyrates are &s;ometimes under of engaging &s;uch, and that many Parts of his own Defence had been confirmed by the Evidence, who had a&s;&s;erted he acted with Reluctance, and had expre&s;&s;ed a Concern and Trouble for the little Hopes remain'd to him, of extricating him&s;elf. That he had u&s;ed all Pri&s;oners (as they were called) well, at the hazard of ill U&s;age to him&s;elf. That he had not in any military Capacity a&s;&s;i&s;ted their Robberies.

<P>The Sickne&s;s he alledged, but more e&s;pecially the Circum&s;tance of lo&s;ing his Leg, were Aggravations of his Fault, &s;hewing him more alert on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, than he was now willing to be thought: As to the Name of Captain, if it were allowed to give him no Precedence out of Battle, yet here it was prov'd a Title of Authority; &s;uch an Au|thority as could direct an Engagement again&s;t the King's Colours, and therefore he was in the high|e&s;t Degree, <HI>Guilty.</HI></P>

<P>Captain <HI>Jo.

Again, when the Crew came to Election of a chief Surgeon, and this Deponent was &s;et up with the others, <HI>Wil&s;on</HI> told him, he hoped he would carry it from <HI>Scudamore,</HI> for that a quarter Share, (which they had more than others,) would be worth looking after; but the Deponent, mi&s;&s;ed
<PB N="245" REF="254">
the Preferment, by the good Will of the <HI>Ranger</HI>'s People, who in general voted for <HI>Scudamore,</HI> to get rid of him, (the chief Surgeon being always to remain with the Commadore.)</P>
<P>It appeared likewi&s;e by the Evidence of Captain <HI>Jo. Trahern, Tho. Cartel,</HI> and others, who had been taken by the Pyrates, and thence had Opportu|nities of ob&s;erving the Pri&s;oner's Conduct, that he &s;eem'd thoroughly &s;atisfy'd with that Way of Life, and was particularly intimate with <HI>Roberts;</HI> they often &s;coffing at the Mention of a Man of War, and &s;aying, if they &s;hould meet with any of the Turnip-Man's Ships they would blow up, and go to H&mdash;ll together. Yet &s;etting a&s;ide the&s;e &s;illy Freaks to recommend him&s;elf, his Lazine&s;s had got him many Enemies, even <HI>Roberts</HI> told him, (on the Complaint of a wounded Man, whom he had refu&s;ed to Dre&s;s,) that he was a double Rogue, to be there a &s;econd Time, and threatned to cut his Ears off.</P>
<P>The Evidence further a&s;&s;ured the Court, from Captain <HI>Thomas Tarlton,</HI> that the Pri&s;oner was taken out of his Brother's Ship, &s;ome Months be|fore, a fir&s;t Time, and being forward to oblige his new Company, had pre&s;ently ask'd for the Py|rates Boat, to fetch the Medicine Che&s;t away; when the Wind and Current proving too hard to contend with, they were drove on Shore at Cape <HI>Montzerado.</HI></P>
<P>The Pri&s;oner called for <HI>William Darling,</HI> and <HI>Samu|el Morwel,</HI> (acquitted,) and <HI>Nicholas Butler.</HI></P>
<P><HI>William Darling</HI> depo&s;ed, the fir&s;t Time the Pri|&s;oner fell into their Hands, <HI>Roberts</HI> mi&s;took him for <HI>Jo. Tarlton</HI> the Ma&s;ter, and being informed it was the Surgeon who came to repre&s;ent him, (then indi&s;|po&s;ed,) he pre&s;ently &s;wore he &s;hould be his Me&s;s|mate, to which <HI>Wil&s;on</HI> reply'd, he hoped not, he had a Wife and Child, which the other laugh'd at;
<PB N="246" REF="255">
and that he had been two Days on Board, before he went in that Boat, which was drove on Shore at Cape <HI>Montzerado.</HI> And at his &s;econd coming, in the <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> he heard <HI>Roberts</HI> order he &s;hould be brought on Board in the fir&s;t Boat.</P>
<P><HI>Samuel Morwel</HI> &s;ays, that he has heard him be|wail his Condition, while on Board the Pyrate, and de&s;ired one <HI>Thomas,</HI> to u&s;e his Intere&s;t with <HI>Roberts,</HI> for a Di&s;charge, &s;aying, his Employ, and the little Fortune he had left at home, would, he hope'd, exempt him the further trouble of &s;eeking his Bread at Sea.</P>
<P><HI>Nicholas Butler,</HI> who had remained with the Py|rates about 48 Hours, when they took the <HI>French</HI> Ships at <HI>Whydah,</HI> depo&s;es, that in this Space the Pri&s;oner addre&s;&s;ed him in the <HI>French</HI> Language, &s;eve|ral times, deploring the Wretchedne&s;s and ill For|tune of being confined in &s;uch Company.</P>
<P>The Pri&s;oner de&s;iring Liberty of two or three Que&s;tions, ask'd, whether or no he had not expo|&s;tulated with <HI>Roberts,</HI> for a Rea&s;on of his obliging Surgeons to &s;ign their Articles, when heretofore they did not? Whether he had not expre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf glad of having formerly e&s;caped from them? Whether he had not &s;aid, at taking the Ships in <HI>Whydah</HI> Road, that he could like the Sport were it lawful? And whether if he had not told him, &s;hould the Company di&s;charge any Sur|geon, that he would in&s;i&s;t on it as his Turn? The Deponent an&s;wered, Yes, to every Que&s;tion &s;epa|rately; and farther, that he believes <HI>Scudamore</HI> had not &s;een <HI>Wil&s;on</HI> when he fir&s;t came and found him out of the <HI>Elizabeth.</HI></P>
<P>He added, in his own Defence, that being Surgeon with one <HI>John Tarlton,</HI> of <HI>Leverpool,</HI> he was met a fir&s;t time on this Coa&s;t of <HI>Guiney,</HI> by <HI>Roberts</HI> the Pyrate; who, after a Day or two, told him, to his Sorrow, that he was to &s;tay there, and ordered him to fetch
<PB N="247" REF="256">
his Che&s;t (not Medicines, as a&s;&s;erted,) which Op|portunity he took to make his E&s;cape; for the Boat's Crew happening to con&s;i&s;t of five <HI>French</HI> and one <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man, all as willing as him&s;elf, they agreed to pu&s;h the Boat on Shore, and tru&s;t them|&s;elves with the Negroes of Cape <HI>Montzerado:</HI> Hazar|dous, not only in Re&s;pect of the dangerous Seas that run there, but the Inhumanity of the Natives, who &s;ometimes take a liking to humane Carca&s;&s;es. Here he remained five Months, till <HI>Thomas Tarlton,</HI> Brother to his Captain, chanc'd to put in the Road for Trade, to whom he repre&s;ented his Hard&s;hips and &s;tarving Condition; but was, in an unchri&s;tian Manner, both refu&s;ed a Relea&s;e of this Captivity, or &s;o much as a &s;mall Supply of Bi&s;cuit and &s;alt Meat, becau&s;e, as he &s;aid, he had been among the Pyrates. A little time after this, the Ma&s;ter of a <HI>French</HI> Ship paid a Ran&s;om for him, and took him off; but, by Rea&s;on of a na&s;ty leperous Indi&s;po&s;i|tion he had contracted by hard and bad living, was, to his great Misfortune, &s;et on Shore at <HI>Se&s;tos</HI> again, when Captain <HI>Sharp</HI> met him, and generou&s;ly procured his Relea&s;e in the Manner him&s;elf has related, and for which he &s;tands infinitely obli|ged.&mdash;That ill Luck threw him a &s;econd time into the Pyrate's Hands, in this Ship <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> where he met <HI>Thomas Tarlton,</HI> and thoughtle&s;ly u&s;ed &s;ome Re|proaches of him, for his &s;evere Treatment at <HI>Mont|zerado;</HI> but prote&s;ts without De&s;ign his Words &s;hould have had &s;o bad a Con&s;equence; for <HI>Ro|berts</HI> took upon him, as a Di&s;pen&s;er of Ju&s;tice, the Correction of Mr. <HI>Tarlton,</HI> beating him unmercifully; and he hopes it will be believed, contrary to any Intention of his it &s;hould &s;o happen, becau&s;e as a Stranger he might be &s;uppo&s;ed to have no Influ|ence, and believes there were &s;ome other Motives for it.&mdash;He cannot remember he expre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf glad to &s;ee <HI>Roberts</HI> this &s;econd time, or that
<PB N="248" REF="257">
he dropped tho&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions about <HI>Comry,</HI> as are &s;worn; but if Immaturity of Judgment had oc|ca&s;ioned him to &s;lip ra&s;h and inadvertent Words, or that he had paid any undue Compliments to <HI>Roberts,</HI> it was to ingratiate him&s;elf, as every Pri|&s;oner did, for a more civil Treatment, and in par|ticular to procure his Di&s;charge, which he had been promi&s;ed, and was afraid would have been revo|ked, if &s;uch a Per&s;on as <HI>Comry</HI> did not remain there to &s;upply his Room; and of this, he &s;aid, all the Gentlemen (meaning the Pyrates) could witne&s;s for him.</P>
<P>He urged al&s;o his Youth in Excu&s;e for his Ra&s;h|ne&s;s.&mdash;The fir&s;t time he had been with them (on|ly a Month in all) and that in no military Employ; but in particular, the Service he had done in di&s;co|vering the De&s;ign the Pyrates had to Ri&s;e in their Pa&s;&s;age on board the <HI>Swallow.

<P>But Execution re&s;pited till the King's Plea&s;ure be known, becau&s;e the Commander of the <HI>Swallow</HI> had declared, the fir&s;t Notice he received of this De&s;ign of the Pyrates to Ri&s;e, was from him.</P>

<HEAD>Benjamin Jeffrys.</HEAD>
<P>BY the Depo&s;itions of <HI>Glasby</HI> and <HI>Lillburn</HI> (acquit|ted) again&s;t this Pri&s;oner, it appeared, that his Drunkenne&s;s was what at fir&s;t detained him from going away in his proper Ship, the <HI>Norman</HI> Galley; and next Morning, for having been abu&s;ive in his Drink, &s;aying to the Pyrates, there was not a Man among&s;t them, he received, for a Welcome, &s;ix La&s;hes from every Per&s;on in the Ship which di&s;|order'd him for &s;ome Weeks, but on Recovery, was made Boat&s;wain's Mate; the &s;erving of which, or any Office on board a Pyrate, is at their own Option (tho' elected) becau&s;e others are glad to ac|cept what brings an additional Share in Prize.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="258">
The Deponents further &s;ay, that at <HI>Sierraleon</HI> eve|ry Man had more e&s;pecially the Means of e&s;caping; and that this Pri&s;oner, in particular, neglected it, and came off from that Place after their Ship was under Sail, and going out of the River.</P>
<P>The Pri&s;oner, in his Defence, prote&s;ts, he was at fir&s;t forc'd; and that the Office of Boat&s;wain's Mate was impo&s;ed on him, and what he would have been glad to have relinqui&s;h'd. That the barbarous whipping he had received from the Pyrates at fir&s;t, was for telling them, that none who could get their Bread in an hone&s;t Way, would be on &s;uch an Account. And he had certainly taken the Oppor|tunity which pre&s;ented at <HI>Sierraleon,</HI> of ridding him|&s;elf from &s;o di&s;ta&s;tful a Life, if there had not been three or four of the old Pyrates on Shore at the &s;ame Time, who, he imagined, mu&s;t know of him, and would doubtle&s;s have &s;erved him the &s;ame, if not wor&s;e, than they &s;ince had done <HI>Wil|liam Williams;</HI> who, for &s;uch a De&s;ign, being de|livered up by the treacherous Natives, had re|ceived two La&s;hes thro' the whole Ship's Company.</P>
<P>The Court ob&s;erved, the Excu&s;es of the&s;e Py|rates, about want of Means to e&s;cape, was often|times as poor and eva&s;ive as their Pleas of being forced at fir&s;t; for here, at <HI>Sierraleon,</HI> every Man had his Liberty on Shore, and it was evident, might have kept it, if he, or they, had &s;o plea&s;ed. And &s;uch are further culpable, who having been introduced into the Society, by &s;uch uncivil Me|thods, as whipping, or beating, neglect le&s;s likely Means of regaining Liberty; it &s;hews &s;trong In|clinations to Di&s;hone&s;ty, and they &s;tand inexcu|&s;ably, <HI>Guilty.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Jo. Mansfield.</HEAD>
<P>IT was proved again&s;t this Pri&s;oner, by Captain <HI>Trahern</HI> and <HI>George Fenn,</HI> that he was one of tho&s;e Voluntiers who was at the Attack and Rob|bery
<PB N="250" REF="259">
of the Company's Ship, called the <HI>King Solo|mon:</HI> That he bully'd well among them who dar'd not make any Reply, but was very ea&s;y with his Friends, who knew him; for <HI>Moody,</HI> on this Occa|&s;ion, took a large Gla&s;s from him, and threatned to blow his Brains out, (a favourite Phra&s;e with the&s;e Pyrates,) if he muttered at it.</P>
<P>From others acquitted, it likewi&s;e appeared, that he was at fir&s;t a Voluntier among them, from an I&s;land call'd <HI>Dominico,</HI> in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and had, to recommend him&s;elf, told them he was a De|&s;erter from the <HI>Ro&s;e</HI> Man of War, and before that, had been on the High-Way; he was always drunk they &s;aid, and &s;o bad at the Time they met with the <HI>Swallow,</HI> that he knew nothing of the Action, but came up vaporing with his Cutla&s;h, after the <HI>Fortune</HI> had &s;truck her Colours, to know who would go on Board the Prize; and it was &s;ome Time before they could per&s;wade him into the Truth of their Condition.</P>
<P>He could &s;ay little in Defence of him&s;elf, ac|knowledg'd this latter Part, of Drunkenne&s;s; a Vice, he &s;ays, that had too great a Share in in&s;naring him into this cour&s;e of Life, and had been a greater Motive, with him, than Gold. <HI>Guilty.</HI></P>

<HEAD>William Davis.</HEAD>
<P><HI>WIlliam Allen</HI> depo&s;ed, he knew this Pri&s;oner at <HI>Sierraleon,</HI> belonging to the <HI>Ann</HI> Galley; that he had a Quarrel with, and beat, the Mate of that Ship, for which, (as he &s;aid) being afraid to return to his Duty, he con&s;orted to the idle Cu|&s;toms and Ways of living among the Negroes, from whom he received a Wife, and ungratefully &s;old her, one Evening, for &s;ome Punch, to quench his Thir&s;t. After this, having put him&s;elf under the Protection of Mr. <HI>Plunket,</HI> Governor there for the Royal <HI>African</HI> Company: The Relations and
<PB N="251" REF="260">
Friends of the Woman, apply'd to him for Re|dre&s;s, who immediately &s;urrendred the Pri&s;oner, and told them, he did not care if they took his Head off; but the Negroes wi&s;ely judging it would not fetch &s;o good a Price, they &s;old him in his Turn again, to <HI>Seignior Jo&s;&s;ee,</HI> a Chri&s;tian Black, and Native of that Place; who expected and agreed for two Years Service from him, on Con&s;ideration of what he had disbur&s;ed, for the Redemption of the Woman: But long before the Expiration of this Time, <HI>Roberts</HI> came into <HI>Sierraleon</HI> River, where the Pri&s;oner, (as <HI>Seignior Jo&s;&s;ee</HI> a&s;&s;ured the Deponent,) entered a Voluntier with them.</P>
<P>The Deponent further coroborates this Part of the Evidence; in that he being obliged to call at Cape <HI>Mount,</HI> in his Pa&s;&s;age down hither, met there with two De&s;erters from <HI>Roberts</HI>'s Ship, who a&s;&s;ured him of the &s;ame; and that the Pyrates did de&s;ign to turn <HI>Davis</HI> away the next Opportuni|ty, as an idle good-for-nothing Fellow.</P>
<P>From <HI>Glasby</HI> and <HI>Lilburn,</HI> it was evident, that every Pyrate, while they &s;tay'd at <HI>Sierraleon,</HI> went on Shore at Di&s;cretion. That <HI>Roberts</HI> had often a&s;&s;ured Mr. <HI>Glyn</HI> and other Traders, at that Place, that he would force no Body; and in &s;hort, there was no Occa&s;ion for it; in particular, the Pri&s;o|ner's Row-Mate went away, and thinks, he might have done the &s;ame, if he had been plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Pri&s;oner alledged, his having been detained again&s;t his Will, and &s;ays, that returning with Elephants Teeth, for <HI>Sierraleon,</HI> the Pyrate's Boat pur&s;ued and brought him on Board, where he was kept on Account of his under&s;tanding the Pilotage and Navigation of that River.</P>
<P>It was obvious to the Court, not only how fri|volous Excu&s;es of Con&s;traint and Force, were among the&s;e People, at their fir&s;t commencing Py|rates, but al&s;o, it was plain to them, from the&s;e
<PB N="252" REF="261">
two De&s;erters, met at Cape <HI>Mount,</HI> and the di&s;|cretional Manner they lived in, at <HI>Sierraleon;</HI> thro' how little Difficulty &s;everal of them did, and others might have e&s;caped afterwards, if they could but have obtained their own Con&s;ents for it. <HI>Guilty.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;hall proceed no farther in the Tryals, for the Rea&s;ons before mentioned; the foregoing Li&s;ts, &s;hewing by a * before the Names, who were condemn'd; tho&s;e Names with a &dagger; were referred for Tryal, to the Mar&s;hal&s;ea, and all the re&s;t were acquitted.</P>

<P>I am not ignorant, how acceptable the Behaviour and dying Words of Malefactors are to the gene|rallity of our Countrymen, and therefore &s;hall deliver, what occur'd worthy of Notice, in the Behaviour of the&s;e Criminals.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;ix that were call'd to Execution, were <HI>Magnes, Moody, Simp&s;on, Sutton, A&s;hplant,</HI> and <HI>Hardy;</HI> all of them old Standers and notorious Offenders: When they were brought out of the Hold, on the Parade, in order to break off their Fet|ters, and fit the Halters; none of them, it was ob&s;erved, appeared the lea&s;t dejected, unle&s;s <HI>Sut|ton,</HI> who &s;poke faint, but it was rather imputed to a Flux that had &s;eiz'd him two or three Days be|fore, than Fear. A Gentleman, who was Surgeon of the Ship, was &s;o charitable at this Time, to offer him&s;elf in the room of an Ordinary, and repre|&s;ented to them as well as he was able, the Heinou&s;ne&s;s of their Sin, and Nece&s;&s;ity which lay on them of Re|pentance;
<PB N="258" REF="267">
one particular Part of which ought to be, acknowledging the Ju&s;tice they had met with. They &s;eem'd heedle&s;s for the pre&s;ent, &s;ome calling for Water to drink, and others applying to the Soldiers for Caps; but when this Gentleman pre&s;s'd them for an An&s;wer, they all exclaim'd again&s;t the Severity of the Court, and were &s;o harden'd, as to cur&s;e, and wi&s;h the &s;ame Ju&s;tice might overtake all the Members of it, as had been dealt to them. <HI>They were poor Rogues,</HI> they &s;aid, <HI>and &s;o hang'd, while others, no le&s;s Guilty in another Way, e&s;caped.</HI></P>
<P>When he endeavoured to compo&s;e their Minds, exhorting them to dye in Charity with all the World, and would have diverted them from &s;uch vain Di&s;cour&s;e, by asking them their Country, Age, and the like; &s;ome of them an&s;wered, <Q>&startq;What was that to him, they &s;uffered the Law, and &s;hould give no Account but to God;&endq;</Q> walking to the Gal|lows without a Tear, in token of Sorrow for their pa&s;t Offences, or &s;hewing as much Concern as a Man would expre&s;s at travelling a bad Road; nay, <HI>Simp&s;on,</HI> at &s;eeing a Woman that he knew, &s;aid, <Q>&startq;he had lain with that B&mdash;h three times, and now &s;he was come to &s;ee him hanged.&endq;</Q> And <HI>Hardy,</HI> when his Hands were ty'd behind him, (which happened from their not being acquainted with the Way of bringing Malefactors to Execution,) ob|&s;erved <Q>&startq;that he had &s;een many a Man hang'd, but this way of the Hands being ty'd behind them, he was a Stranger to, and never &s;aw before in his Life.&endq;</Q> I mention the&s;e two little In&s;tances, to &s;hew how &s;tupid and thoughtle&s;s they were of their End, and that the &s;ame abandoned and re|probate Temper, that had carried them thro' their Rogu$ries, abided with them to the la&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Samuel Fletcher,</HI> another of the Pyrates ordered for Execution, but reprieved, &s;eem'd to have a

quicker Sen&s;e of his Condition; <Q>for when he &s;aw tho&s;e he was allotted with, gone to Execution, he &s;ent a Me&s;&s;age by the Provo&s;t Mar&s;hal to the Court, to be &startq;in|form'd of the Meaning of it, and humbly de&s;ired to know, whether they de&s;ign'd him Mercy, or not? If they did, he &s;tood infinitely oblig'd to them, and thought the whole Service of his Life, an incompe|tent Return for &s;o great a Favour; but that if he was to Suffer, the &s;ooner the better, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> that he might be out of his Pain.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>There were others of the&s;e Pyrates the rever&s;e of this, and tho' de&s;titute of Mini&s;ters, or fit Per|&s;ons to repre&s;ent their Sins, and a&s;&s;i&s;t them with Spiritual Advice, were yet always imploying their Time to good Purpo&s;es, and behav'd with a great deal of &s;eeming Devotion and Penitence; among the&s;e may be reckoned <HI>Scudamore, Williams, Philips, Stephen&s;on, Jefferys, Le&s;ly, Harper, Arm&s;trong, Bunce,</HI> and others.</P>
<P><HI>Scudamore</HI> too lately di&s;cern'd the Folly and Wickedne&s;s of the Enterprize, that had chiefly brought him under Sentence of Death, from which, &s;eeing there was no Hopes of e&s;caping, he petiti|oned for two or three Days Reprieve, which was granted; and for that Time apply'd him &s;elf in|ce&s;&s;antly to Prayer and reading the Scriptures, &s;eem'd to have a deep Sen&s;e of his Sins, of this in particular, and de&s;ired, at the Gallows, they would have Patience with him, to &s;ing the fir&s;t Part of the thirty fir&s;t P&s;alm; which he did by him&s;elf throughout.</P>
<P><HI>Arm&s;trong,</HI> having been a De&s;erter from his Ma|je&s;ty's Service, was executed on Board the <HI>Wey|mouth,</HI> (and the only one that was;) there was no Body to pre&s;s him to an acknowledgement of the Crime he died for, nor of &s;orrowing in particular for it, which would have been exemplary, and made &s;uitable Impre&s;&s;ions on Seamen; &s;o that his
<PB N="260" REF="269">
la&s;t Hour was &s;pent in lamenting and bewail|ing his Sins in general, exhorting the Specta|tors to an hone&s;t and good Life, in which alone they could find Satisfaction. In the End, he de|&s;ired they would join with him, in &s;inging two or three latter Ver&s;es of the 140 P&s;alm, and that being concluded, he was, at firing of a Gun, triced up at the Fore-Yard-Arm.</P>
<P><HI>Bunce</HI> was a young Man, not above 26 Years old, but made the mo&s;t pathetical Speech of any, at the Gallows. He fir&s;t declaimed again&s;t the guilded Bates of Power, Liberty, and Wealth, that had en&s;nared him among the Pyrates, his unexperienced Years not being able to with&s;tand the Temptation; but that the Briskne&s;s he had &s;hewn, which &s;o fatally had procured him Favour among&s;t them, was not &s;o much a Fault in Principle, as the Liveline&s;s and Vivacity of his Nature. He was now ex|treamly afflicted for the Injuries he had done to all Men, and begg'd their's, and God's Forgivene&s;s, very earne&s;tly exhorting the Spectators to remem|ber their Creator in their Youth, and guard be|times, that their Minds took not a wrong Bya&s;s, concluding with this apt Similitude, <HI>That he &s;tood there as a Beacon upon a Rock,</HI> (the Gallows &s;tanding on one) <HI>to warn erring Mariners of Danger.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. OF Captain <HI>WORLEY,</HI> And his CREW.</HEAD>
<P>HIS Reign was but &s;hort, but his Beginning &s;omewhat particular, &s;etting out in a &s;mall open Boat, with eight others, from <HI>New-York.</HI> This was as re&s;olute a Crew as ever went upon the Account: They took with them a few Bi&s;cuits and a dry'd Tongue or two, a little Cag of Water, half a dozen old Muskets and Ammuni|tion accordingly. Thus provided, they left <HI>New-York</HI> the latter End of <HI>September</HI> 1718, but it can|not be &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;uch a Man of War as this, could undertake any con&s;iderable Voyage, or at|tempt any extraordinary Enterprize; &s;o they &s;tood down the Coa&s;t, till they came to <HI>Delaware</HI> River, which is about 150 Miles di&s;tant, and not meeting with any Thing in their Way, they turn'd up the &s;ame River as high as <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> near which Place, they fell upon a Shallop belonging to <HI>George Grant,</HI> who was bringing Hou&s;ehold Goods, Plate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from <HI>Oppoquenimi</HI> to <HI>Philadelphia;</HI> they made Prize of the mo&s;t valuable Part of them, and let the Shal|lop go. This Fact could not come under the Ar|ticle of Pyracy, it not being committed <HI>&s;uper altum Mare,</HI> upon the High-Sea, therefore was a &s;imple
<PB N="262" REF="271">
Robbery only; but they did not &s;tand for a Point of Law in the Ca&s;e, but ea&s;ing the Shallop Man of his Lading, the bold Adventurers went down the River again.</P>
<P>The Shallop came &s;trait to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and brought the ill News thither, which &s;o alarm'd the Government, as if War had been declared again&s;t them; Expre&s;&s;es were &s;ent to <HI>New-York,</HI> and other Places, and &s;everal Ve&s;&s;els fitted out again&s;t this powerful Rover, but to no manner of Purpo&s;e; for after &s;everal Days Cruize, they all return'd, without &s;o much as hearing what became of the Robbers.</P>
<P><HI>Worley</HI> and his Crew, in going down the River, met with a Sloop of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> belonging to a Mulatto, whom they call'd <HI>Black Robin;</HI> they quit|ted their Boat for this Sloop, taking one of <HI>Black Robin</HI>'s Men along with them, as they had al&s;o done from <HI>George Grant,</HI> be&s;ides two Negroes, which encrea&s;ed the Company one Third. A Day or two after, they took another Sloop belonging to <HI>Hull,</HI> homeward bound, which was &s;omewhat fitter for their Purpo&s;e; they found aboard her, Provi&s;ions and Nece&s;&s;aries, which they &s;tood in need of, and enabled them to pro&s;ecute their De&s;ign, in a manner more &s;uitable to their Wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>Upon the Succe&s;s of the&s;e Pyrates, the Gover|nor i&s;&s;ued out a Proclamation, for the apprehend|ing and taking all Pyrates, who had refu&s;ed or neg|lected to &s;urrender them&s;elves, by the Time limi|ted in his Maje&s;ty's Proclamation of Pardon; and thereupon, ordered his Maje&s;ty's Ship <HI>Phaenix,</HI> of 20 Guns, which lay at <HI>Sandy Hook,</HI> to Sea, to Cruize upon this Pyrate, and &s;ecure the Trade to that, and the adjoining Colonies.</P>
<P>In all probality, the taking this Sloop &s;av'd their Bacons, for this Time, tho' they fell into the Trap pre&s;ently afterwards; for they finding them&s;elves
<PB N="263" REF="272">
in tolerable good Condition, having a Ve&s;&s;el newly cleaned, with Provi&s;ions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they &s;tood off to Sea, and &s;o mi&s;&s;ed the <HI>Phaenix,</HI> who expected them to be &s;till on the Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>About &s;ix Weeks afterwards they return'd, ha|ving taking both a Sloop and a Brigantine, among the <HI>Buhama I&s;lands;</HI> the former they &s;unk, and the other they let go: The Sloop belonged to <HI>New-York,</HI> and they thought the &s;inking of her good Poli|cy, to prevent her returning to tell Tales at Home.</P>
<P><HI>Worley</HI> had by this Time, encrea&s;ed his Company to about five and twenty Men, had &s;ix Guns mounted, and &s;mall Arms as many as was nece&s;|&s;ary for them, and &s;eem'd to be in a good thriving &s;ort of a Way. He made a black En&s;ign, with a white Death's Head in the middle of it, and other Colours &s;uitable to it. They all &s;ign'd Articles, and bound them&s;elves under a &s;olemn Oath, to take no Quarters, but to &s;tand by one another to the la&s;t Man, which was ra&s;hly fulfill'd a little afterwards.</P>
<P>For going into an Inlet in <HI>North Carolina,</HI> to clean, the Governor receiv'd Information of it, and fitted out two Sloops, one with eight Guns, and the other with &s;ix, and about &s;eventy Men between them. <HI>Worley</HI> had clean'd his Sloop, and &s;ail'd be|fore the <HI>Carolina</HI> Sloops reach'd the Place, and &s;teer'd to the Northward; but the Sloops, ju&s;t mention'd, pur&s;uing the &s;ame Cour&s;e, came in &s;ight of <HI>Worley,</HI> as he was crui&s;ing off the Capes of <HI>Vir|ginia,</HI> and being in the Offin, he &s;tood in as &s;oon as he &s;aw the Sloops, intending thereby to have cut them off from <HI>James</HI> River; for he verily believed they had been bound thither, not imagining, in the lea&s;t, they were in Pur&s;uit of him.</P>
<P>The two Sloops &s;tanding towards the Capes at the &s;ame Time, and <HI>Worley</HI> hoi&s;ting of his black Flag, the Inhabitants of <HI>James</HI> Town, were in
<PB N="264" REF="273">
the utmo&s;t Con&s;ternation, thinking that all three had been Pyrates, and that their De&s;ign had been upon them; &s;o that all the Ships and Ve&s;&s;els, that were in the Road, or in the Rivers up the Bay, had Orders immediately to hale into the Shore, for their Security, or el&s;e to prepare for their De|fence, if they thought them&s;elves in a Condition to fight. Soon after, two Boats, who were &s;ent out to get Intelligence, came crowding in, and brought an Account, that one of the Pyrates was in the Bay, being a &s;mall Sloop of &s;ix Guns. The Gover|nor expecting the re&s;t would have followed, and thought they would make &s;ome Attempt to land, for the &s;ake of Plunder, beat to Arms, and collect|ed all the Force that could be got together, to make an Oppo&s;ition; he order'd all the Guns out of the Ships, to made a Platform, and, in &s;hort, put the whole Colony in a Warlike Po&s;ture; but was very much &s;urpriz'd at la&s;t, to &s;ee all the &s;uppo|&s;ed Pyrates, fighting with one another.</P>
<P>The Truth of the Matter is, <HI>Worley</HI> gain'd the Bay, and therefore made &s;ure of his two Prizes, by keeping them from coming in; but by the hoi&s;t|ing of the King's Colours, and firing a Gun, he quickly was &s;en&s;ible of his Mi&s;take, and too &s;oon perceiv'd that the Tables were turn'd upon him; that in&s;tead of keeping them out, he found him&s;elf, by a &s;uperiour Force, kept in. When the Pyrates &s;aw how things went, they re&s;olutely prepared them&s;elves for a de&s;perate Defence; and tho' three to one odds, <HI>Worley,</HI> and his &s;mall Crew, determined to fight to the la&s;t Ga&s;p, and receive no Quarters, agreeably to what they had before &s;worn; &s;o that they mu&s;t either Dye, or Conquer, upon the Spot.</P>
<P>The <HI>Carrlina</HI> Men, gave the Pyrate a Broad&s;ide, and then boarded him, one Sloop getting upon his Quarter, and the other on his Bow; <HI>Worley</HI> and the Crew, drew up, upon the Deck, and fought
<PB N="265" REF="274">
very ob&s;tinately, Hand to Hand, &s;o that in a few Minutes, abundance of Men lay weltring in their Gore; the Pyrates proved as good as their Words, not a Man of them cry'd out for Quarter, nor would they accept of &s;uch, when offer'd, but were all killed, except the Captain and another Man, and tho&s;e very much wounded, whom they re&s;erv'd for the Gallows. They were brought a&s;hore in Irons, and the next Day, which was the 17th of <HI>February,</HI> 1718-9, they were both hang'd up, for fear they &s;hould dye, and evade the Puni&s;h|ment, as was thought due to their Crimes.</P>

<P><HI>GEorge Lowther</HI> &s;ail'd out of the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> in one of the Royal <HI>African</HI> Com|pany's Ships, call'd the <HI>Gambia Ca&s;tle,</HI> of 16 Guns and 30 Men, <HI>Charles Ru&s;&s;el</HI> Commader; of which Ship, the &s;aid <HI>Lowther</HI> was &s;econd Mate. Aboard of the &s;ame Ship, was a certain Number of Soldiers, commanded by one <HI>John Ma&s;&s;ey,</HI> who were to be carried to one of the Company's Set|tlements, on the River of <HI>Gambia,</HI> to Garri&s;on a
<PB N="266" REF="275">
Fort, which was &s;ometime ago taken and de&s;troy'd by Captain <HI>Davis</HI> the Pyrate.</P>
<P>In <HI>May</HI> 1721, the <HI>Gambia Ca&s;tle</HI> came &s;afe to her Port, in <HI>Africa,</HI> and landed Captain <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey</HI> and his Men on <HI>James</HI>'s I&s;land, where he was to Com|mand under the Governor, Collonel <HI>Whitney,</HI> who arrived there but a little while before: And here, by a fatal Mi&s;under&s;tanding, between the military Folks and the trading People, the Fort, and Gar|ri&s;on, not only came to be lo&s;t again to the Com|pany, but a fine Galley well provided, and worth 10000 l. turn'd again&s;t her Ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>The Names of Governor and Captain &s;ounded great, but when the Gentlemen found that the Pow|er that generally goes along with tho&s;e Titles, was over&s;way'd and born down by the Merchants and Factors, (mechanick Fellows as they thought them) they grew very impatient and di&s;atisfy'd, e&s;pecially <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey,</HI> who was very loud in his Com|plaints again&s;t them, particularly at the &s;mall Al|lowance of Provi&s;ions to him and his Men; for the Garri&s;on and Governor too, were victualled by the Merchants, which was no &s;mall Grievance and Mortification to them. And as the want of eating was the only Thing that made the great <HI>Sancho</HI> quit his Government, &s;o did it here rend and tare their's to Pieces: For <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey</HI> told them, <HI>That he did not come there to be a Guiney Slave, and that he had promi&s;ed his Men good Treatment, and Provi&s;ions fitting for Soldiers: That as he had the Care of &s;o many of his Maje&s;ty's Sub|jects, if they would not provide for them in a hand&s;ome Manner, he &s;hould take &s;uitable Mea&s;ures for the Pre&s;er|vation of &s;o many of his Countrymen and Companions.</HI></P>
<P>The Governor at this Time, was very ill of a Fever, and, for the better Accommodation in his Sickne&s;s, was carried aboard the Ship <HI>Gambia Ca&s;tle,</HI> where he continued for above three Weeks,
<PB N="267" REF="276">
and therefore could have little to &s;ay in this Di&s;|pute, tho' he re&s;olved not to &s;tay in a Place, where there was &s;o little Occa&s;ion for him, and where his Power was &s;o confin'd. The Merchants had cer|tainly Orders from the Company, to i&s;&s;ue the Pro|vi&s;ions out to the Garri&s;on, and the &s;ame is done along the whole Coa&s;t; but whether they had cut them &s;hort of the Allowance that was made for them, I can't &s;ay, but if they did, then is the Lo&s;s of the Ship and Garri&s;on owing principally to their ill Conduct.</P>
<P>However, an Accident that happened on Board the Ship, did not a little contribute to this Mis|fortune, which was a Pique that the Captain of her took again&s;t his &s;econd Mate, <HI>George Lowther,</HI> the Man who is the Subject of this &s;hort Hi&s;tory; and who lo&s;ing his Favour, found Means to ingra|tiate him&s;elf into the good liking of the common Sailors, in&s;omuch that when Captain <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> order's him to be puni&s;h'd, the Men took up Hand&s;pikes, and threatned to knock that Man down, that offer|ed to lay hold of the Mate. This &s;erv'd but to widen the Difference between him and the Cap|tain, and more firmly attach'd <HI>Lowther</HI> to the Ship's Company, the greate&s;t Part of which, he found ripe for any Mi&s;chief in the World.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey</HI> was no wit the better reconciled, to the Place, by a longer Continuance, nor to the U&s;age he met with there, and having often Oppor|tunities of conver&s;ing with <HI>Lowther,</HI> with whom he had contracted an Intimacy in the Voyage; they aggravated one another's Grievances to &s;uch a height, that they re&s;olved upon Mea&s;ures to curb the Power that controul'd them, and provide for them&s;elves after another Manner.</P>
<P>When the Governor recover'd of his Fever, he went a&s;hore to the I&s;land, but took no Notice of <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey</HI>'s Behaviour, tho' it was &s;uch as might give
<PB N="268" REF="277">
Su&s;picion of what he de&s;igned; and <HI>Lowther,</HI> and the common Sailors, who were in the Secret of Affairs, grew in&s;olent and bold, even refu&s;ing to obey when commanded to their Duty by Captain <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> and the chief Mate. The Captain &s;eeing how Things were carried, goes a&s;hore early one Morning, to the Gover|nor and Factory, in order to hold a Council, which, <HI>Lowther</HI> apprehending, was in order to prevent his De&s;ign, &s;ent a Letter in the &s;ame Boat to <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey,</HI> intimating it to him, and <HI>that he &s;hould repair on Board, for it was high Time to put their Project in Exe|tion.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey</HI> received this Letter he went to the Soldiers at the <HI>Barracks,</HI> and &s;aid to them, and others, <HI>You that have a Mind to go to England, now is your Time;</HI> and they generally con&s;enting, <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey</HI> went to the Store-Room, bur&s;t open the Door, &s;et two Centinels upon it, and ordered that no Body &s;hould come near it; then he went to the Governor's Apartment, and took his Bed, Bag|gage, Plate, and Furniture, (in Expectation that the Governor him&s;elf, as he had promi&s;ed <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey,</HI> would have gone on Board, which he afterwards refus'd, by Rea&s;on, as he &s;aid, he believed they were going a-pyrating; which at fir&s;t, whatever <HI>Lowther</HI> de&s;igned, <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey</HI> certainly propo&s;ed only the going to <HI>England;)</HI> when this was done, he &s;ent the Boat off to the chief Mate, with this Me&s;|&s;age, <HI>That he &s;hould get the Guns ready, for that the King of</HI> Barro [a Negro Kingdom near the Royal <HI>African</HI> Settlement] <HI>would come aboard to Dinner.</HI> But <HI>Lowther</HI> under&s;tanding be&s;t, the meaning of tho&s;e Orders, he confined the chief Mate, &s;hotted the Guns, and put the Ship in a Condition for &s;ailing. In the Afternoon <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey</HI> came on Board with the Governor's Son, having &s;ent off all the Provi&s;ions of the I&s;land, and eleven Pipes of Wine, leaving
<PB N="269" REF="278">
only two half Pipes behind in the Store-Hou&s;e, and di&s;mounted all the Guns of the Fort.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon they weigh'd one Anchor, but fearing to be too late to get out of the River, they &s;lipp'd the other, and &s;o fell down; in doing of which, they run the Ship a-ground. <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey</HI> &s;hew'd him&s;elf a Soldier upon this Accident, for as &s;oon as the Misfortune happen'd, he left the Ship with about &s;ixteen Hands, and rows directly to the Fort, remounts the Guns, and keeps Garri&s;on there all the Night, while the Ship was a&s;hore; and obliged &s;ome of the Factory to a&s;&s;i&s;t in get|ting her clear. In the mean while, <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> came off, but not being &s;uffered to come on Board, he call'd to <HI>Lowther,</HI> and offer'd him and the Company, what-ever Terms they would be plea&s;ed to accept of, upon Condition of &s;urrendering up the Ship, which had no Effect upon any of them. In the Morning they got her afloat, and <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey</HI> and his Men came aboard, after having nail'd up and di&s;|mounted all the Cannon of the Fort. They put the Governor's Son, and two or three others, a&s;hore, who were not willing to go without the Governor, and &s;ail'd out of the River, having exchang'd &s;e|veral Shot with the <HI>Martha, Otter, &amp;c.</HI> that lay there, without doing Execution on either Side.</P>
<P>When the Ship came out to Sea, <HI>Lowther</HI> called up all the Company, and told them, <HI>it was the greate&s;t Folly imaginable, to think of returning to</HI> Eng|land, <HI>for what they had already done, could not be ju&s;tify|ed upon any Pretence what&s;oever, but would be look'd up|on, in the Eye of the Law, a capital Offence, and that none of them were in a Condition to with&s;tand the Attacks of &s;uch powerful Adver&s;aries, as they would meet with at Home; for his Part he was determined not to run &s;uch a Hazard, and therefore if his Propo&s;al was not agreed to, he de&s;ired to be &s;et a Shore in &s;ome Place of Safety: That they had a</HI>
<PB N="270" REF="279">
<HI>good Ship under them, a parcel of brave Fellows in her, that it was not their Bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;tarve, or be made Slaves; and therefore, if they were all of his Mind, they &s;hould &s;eek their Fortunes upon the Seas, as other Adventurers had done before them.</HI> They one and all came into the Mea&s;ures, and the following &s;hort Articles were drawn up, &s;igned, and &s;worn to upon the Bible; they knocked down the Cabins, made the Ship flu&s;h fore and aft, made black Colours, and put the Ship into a Condition for pyrating: They new nam'd her, <HI>the Delivery,</HI> had about 50 Hands and 16 Guns aboard, and voted for the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> directly.</P>

<P N="8">8. <HI>He that &s;ees a Sail fir&s;t, &s;hall have the be&s;t Pi&s;tol, or Small-Arm, on Board her.</HI></P>
<P>It was the 13th of <HI>June,</HI> that <HI>Lowther</HI> left the Settlement, and on the 20th, being then within twenty Leagues of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> he came up with a Brigantine, belonging to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> called the <HI>Charles, James Dougla&s;s</HI> Ma&s;ter, which they plundered in a pyratical Manner, and let the Ve&s;&s;el go; but lea&s;t &s;he &s;hould meet with any of the Station Ships, and &s;o give Information of the Robbery, <HI>in Terrorem,</HI> to pre|vent a Pur&s;uit, <HI>Lowther</HI> contrived a &s;ort of a Certifi|cate, which he directed the Ma&s;ter to &s;hew to their Con&s;ort, if they &s;hould meet with her; and upon Sight of it, the Brigantine would pa&s;s unmole&s;ted: This Con&s;ort he pretended was a 40 Gun Ship, and crui&s;ing thereabouts.</P>
<P>After this, the <HI>Delivery</HI> proceeded to <HI>Hi&s;paniola;</HI> near the We&s;t End of the I&s;land, &s;he met with a <HI>French</HI> Sloop loaden with Wine and Brandy; aboard of this Ve&s;&s;el went Captain <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey,</HI> as a Merchant, and ask'd the Price of one Thing, and then ano|ther, bidding Money for the mo&s;t Part of the Cargo; but after he had trifled a while, he whi&s;pered a Secret in the <HI>French</HI> Man's Ear, <HI>viz. That they mu&s;t have it all without Money. Mon&s;ieur</HI> pre&s;ently under|&s;tood his meaning, and unwillingly agreed to the Bargain. They took out of her thirty Casks of Brandy, five Hog&s;heads of Wine, &s;everal Pieces of Chintzes, and other valuable Goods, and about &s;eventy Pounds <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> in Money; of which <HI>Lowther</HI> generou&s;ly return'd five Pound back to the <HI>French</HI> Ma&s;ter, for his Civilities.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="281">
But as all Con&s;titutions grow old, and thereby &s;hake and totter, &s;o did our Commonwealth in about a Month of it's Age, feel Commotions and inte&s;tine Di&s;turbances by the Divi&s;ions of its Mem|bers, which had near hand terminated in it's De|&s;truction; the&s;e civil Di&s;cords were owing to the following Occa&s;ion. Captain <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey</HI> had been a Soldier almo&s;t from his Infancy, but was but very indifferently acquainted with Maritime Affairs, and having an enterprizing Soul, nothing would &s;atisfy him, but he mu&s;t be doing Bu&s;ine&s;s in his own Way, therefore he required <HI>Lowther</HI> to let him have thirty Hands to land with, and he would At|tack the <HI>French</HI> Settlements, and bring aboard the Devil and all of Plunder.</P>
<P><HI>Lowther</HI> did all that he could do, and &s;aid all that he could &s;ay, to di&s;&s;wade <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey</HI> from &s;o ra&s;h and dangerous an Attempt; pointing out to him the Hazard the Company would run, and the Con|&s;equences to them all, if he &s;hould not &s;ucceed, and the little likelyhood there was to expect Succe&s;s from the Undertaking: But 'twas all one for that, <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey</HI> would go and attack the <HI>French</HI> Settlements, for any thing <HI>Lowther</HI> could &s;ay again&s;t it; &s;o that he was obliged to propo&s;e the Matter to the Com|pany, among whom <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey</HI> found a few Fellows, as re&s;olute as him&s;elf; however a great Majority being again&s;t it, the Affair was over-ruled in Oppo&s;ition to Captain <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey,</HI> notwith&s;tanding which, <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey</HI> grew fractious, quarrel'd with <HI>Lowther,</HI> and the Men divided into Parties, &s;ome &s;iding with the Land Pyrate, and &s;ome with the Sea Rover, and were all ready to fall together by the Ears, when the Man at the Ma&s;t-Head, cry'd out, a Sail! a Sail! Then they gave over the Di&s;|pute, &s;et all their Sails, and &s;teered after the Chace. In a few Hours they came up with her, &s;he being a &s;mall Ship from <HI>Jamaica,</HI> bound to <HI>England;</HI> they
<PB N="273" REF="282">
took what they thought fit out of her, and a Hand or two, and then <HI>Lowther</HI> was for &s;inking the Ship, with &s;everal Pa&s;&s;engers that were in her, for what Rea&s;on I know not, but <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey</HI> interpo|&s;ed and prevented their cruel Fate, and the Ship &s;afely arrived afterwards in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The next Day they took a &s;mall Sloop, an interloping Trader, which they detain'd with her Cargo. All this while <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey</HI> was unea&s;y, and de|clared his Re&s;olution to leave them, and <HI>Lowther</HI> finding him a very trouble&s;ome Man to deal with, con&s;ented that he &s;hould take the Sloop, la&s;t made Prize of, with what Hands had a Mind to go with him, and Shift for him&s;elf. Whereupon <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey,</HI> and about ten more Malecontents, goes aboard the Sloop, and comes away in her directly for <HI>Jamaica.</HI></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding what had pa&s;&s;ed, Captain <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey</HI> puts a bold Face upon the Matter, and goes to Sir <HI>Nicholas Laws</HI> the Governor, informs him of his leaving <HI>Lowther</HI> the Pyrate, owns <HI>that he a&s;&s;i&s;ted in going off with the Ship, at the River</HI> Gambia, but &s;aid, <HI>'twas to &s;ave &s;o many of his Maje&s;ty's Subjects from peri&s;h|ing, and that his De&s;ign was to return to</HI> England; <HI>but</HI> Lowther <HI>con&s;piring with the greater Part of the Company, went a pyrating with the Ship, and that he had taken this Opportunity to leave him, and Surrender him&s;elf and Ve&s;|&s;el with the Cargo, and every Thing el&s;e, to his Excellency.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ma&s;&s;ey</HI> was very well received by the Governor, and had his Liberty given him, with Promi&s;e of Service, and &s;o forth; and at his own Reque&s;t, he went on Board the <HI>Happy</HI> Sloop, Captain <HI>Laws,</HI> which was immediately ordered out to crui&s;e off <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> for <HI>Lowther;</HI> but not being &s;o fortunate as to meet with him, Captain <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey</HI> returned back to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> in the Sloop, and getting a Cir|tificate, and a Supply of Money from the Gover|nor, he came home Pa&s;&s;enger to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="283">
When <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey</HI> came to Town, he writes a long Letter to the Deputy Governor and Directors of the <HI>African</HI> Company, wherein he imprudently re|lates the whole Tran&s;actions of his Voyage, the going off with the Ship, and the Acts of Pyracy he had committed with <HI>Lowther,</HI> but excu&s;es it as Ra&s;hne&s;s and Inadvertency in him&s;elf, occa&s;ioned by his be|ing ill u&s;ed, contrary to the Promi&s;es he had recei|ved, and the Expectations he had entertained; but own'd, that he de&s;erved to dye for what he had done; yet, if they had Genero&s;ity enough to for|give him, as he is &s;till capable to do them Service, as a Soldier, &s;o he &s;hould be very ready to do it; but if they re&s;olved to pro&s;ecute him, he begg'd only this Favour, that he might not be hanged like a Dog, but dye like a Soldier, as he had been bred from his Childhood, that is, by being Shot.</P>
<P>This was the Sub&s;tance of the Letter, which, however, did not produce &s;o favourable an An&s;wer as he hoped for, Word being brought back to him, <HI>that he &s;hould be fairly hang'd.</HI> Whereupon, <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey</HI> re&s;olved not to be out of the Way, when he found what important Occa&s;ion there was likely to be for him, &s;o takes a Lodging in <HI>Alder&s;gate-Street,</HI> and the next Day went to the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice's Chambers, and enquired if my Lord had granted a Warrant again&s;t Captain <HI>John Ma&s;&s;ey,</HI> for Pyracy; but being told by the Clerks, that they knew of no &s;uch Thing; he informed them he was the Man, that my Lord would &s;oon be apply'd to for that Purpo&s;e, and, the Officer might come to him at &s;uch a Place, where he lodged: They took the Directions in Writing, and in a few Days, a War|rant being i&s;&s;ued, the Tip&s;taff went directly by his own Information, and apprehended him, with|out any other trouble, than walking to his $odging.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="284">
There was then no Per&s;on in Town, to charge him with any Fact, whereby he could be com|mitted; nor could the Letter be proved to be of his Hand-Writting, &s;o that they had been obliged to let him go again, if he had not helped his Ac|cu&s;ers out at a Pinch: The Magi&s;trate was reduced to the putting of this Que&s;tion to him, <HI>did you write this Letter?</HI> He an&s;wered, <HI>He did:</HI> And not only that, but owned all the Contents of it, to be true; upon which, he was committed to <HI>Newgate,</HI> but was afterwards admitted to a hundred Pound Bail, or thereabouts.</P>
<P>On the 5th of <HI>July</HI> 1723, he was brought to his Tryal, at a Court of Admiralty held at the <HI>Old-Baily,</HI> when Captain <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> Governor <HI>Whitney</HI>'s Son and others, appear'd as Evidences, by whom the Indictment was plainly proved again&s;t him; which, if it had not been done, the Captain was of &s;uch an heroick Spirit, that he would have deny'd nothing; for in&s;tead of making a Defence, he on|ly entertained the Court with a long Narrative of his Expedition, from the fir&s;t &s;etting out, to his re|turn to <HI>England,</HI> mentioning two Acts of Pyracy committed by him, which he was not charged with, often challenging the Evidences again&s;t him, if in any Thing he related the lea&s;t Syllable of an Un|truth, that they would contradict him; and in|&s;tead of denying any of them, &s;et forth in the Indictments, he charged him&s;elf with, various Cir|cum&s;tances, which fixed the Facts more home upon him; upon the whole, the Captain was found Guilty, received Sentence of Death, and was exe|cuted three Weeks after, at <HI>Execution-Dock.</HI></P>
<P>We return now to <HI>Lowther,</HI> whom we left cru|&s;ing off <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> from whence he ply'd to Wind|ward, and near <HI>Porto Rico,</HI> cha&s;ed two Sail and &s;poke with them; they proving to be a &s;mall <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> Ship,
<PB N="276" REF="285">
commanded by Captain <HI>Smith,</HI> and a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Pyrate, who had made Prize of her. <HI>Lowther</HI> examined into the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Authority for taking an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship, and threat'ned to put every Man of them to death for &s;o doing; &s;o that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> fancied them&s;elves to be in a very pityful Condition, till Matters cleared up, and they found their Ma&s;ters as great Rogues as them&s;elves, from whom &s;ome Mercy might be expected, in regard to the near Relation they &s;tood with them, as to their Profe&s;|&s;ion; in &s;hort, <HI>Lowther</HI> fir&s;t rifled, and then burnt both the Ships, &s;ending the <HI>Spaniards</HI> away in their Launch, and turning all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Sailors into Pyrates.</P>
<P>After a few Days Cruize, <HI>Lowther</HI> took a &s;mall Sloop belonging to St. <HI>Chri&s;tophers,</HI> which they mann'd and carried along with them to a &s;mall I&s;land, where they cleaned, and &s;tay'd &s;ome Time to take their Diver&s;ions, which con&s;i&s;ted in un|heard of Debaucheries, with drinking, &s;wearing and rioting, in which there &s;eemed to be a kind of Emulation among them, re&s;embling rather Devils than Men, &s;triving who &s;hould out doe one another in new invented Oaths and Execrations.</P>
<P>They all got aboard about <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> ob&s;erving neither Times nor Sea&s;ons, for perpetrating their villainous Actions, and &s;ail'd towards the Bay of <HI>Henduras.</HI> In their Way thither they met with a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el with 13 Hands, in the &s;ame honourable Employment with them&s;elves; the Captain of this Gang was one <HI>Edward Low,</HI> whom we &s;hall particularly di&s;cour&s;e of in a Chapter by it &s;elf: <HI>Lowther</HI> received them as Friends, and treated them with all imaginable Re&s;pect, inviting them as they were few in Number, and in no extraor|dinary Condition to pur&s;ue the Account, (as they called it) to join their Strength together, which on the Con&s;ideration afore&s;aid, was accepted of, <HI>Low|ther</HI>
<PB N="277" REF="286">
&s;till continuing Commander, and <HI>Low</HI> was made Lieutenant; the Ve&s;&s;el the new Pyrates came out of, they &s;unk, and the Confederates proceed the Voyage as <HI>Lowther</HI> before intended.</P>
<P>The 10th of <HI>January,</HI> the Pyrates came into the Bay, and fell upon a Ship of 200 Tun, called the <HI>Greyhound, Benjamin Edwards</HI> Commander, belong|ing to <HI>Bo&s;ton. Lowther</HI> hoi&s;ted his pyratical Co|lours, and fir'd a Gun for the <HI>Greyhound</HI> to bring to, which &s;he refu&s;ing, the <HI>Happy Delivery</HI> (the Name of the Pyrate) edg'd down, and gave her a Broad|&s;ide, which was returned by Captain <HI>Edwards</HI> very bravely, and the Engagement held for an Hour; but Captain <HI>Edwards</HI> finding the Pyrate too Strong for him, and fearing the Con&s;equence of too ob|&s;tinate a Re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t tho&s;e Lawle&s;s Fellows, he ordered his En&s;ign to be Struck. The Pyrates Boat came aboard, and not only rifled the Ship, but whipp'd, beat and cut the Men in a cruel Manner, turned them aboard their own Ship, and then &s;et Fire to their's.</P>
<P>In crui&s;ing about the Bay, they met and took &s;e|veral other Ve&s;&s;els without any Re&s;i&s;tance, <HI>viz.</HI> two Brigantines of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> one of which they burnt, and &s;unk the other; a Sloop belonging to <HI>Connecticut,</HI> Captain <HI>Airs,</HI> which they al&s;o burnt; a Sloop of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> Captain <HI>Hamilton,</HI> they took for their own U&s;e; a Sloop of <HI>Virginia</HI> they unladed, and was &s;o generous as to give her back to the Ma&s;ter that own'd her. They took a a Sloop of 100 Tun, belonging to <HI>Rhode I&s;land,</HI> which they were plea&s;ed to keep, and mounted her with eight Carriage, and ten Swivel Guns.</P>
<P>With this little Fleet, <HI>viz.</HI> Admiral <HI>Lowther,</HI> in the <HI>Happy Delivery,</HI> Captain <HI>Low,</HI> in the <HI>Rhode I&s;land</HI> Sloop, Captain <HI>Harris,</HI> (who was &s;econd Mate in the <HI>Greyhound</HI> when taken,) in <HI>Hamilton</HI>'s Sloop, and the little Sloop formerly mentioned, &s;erving as a
<PB N="278" REF="287">
Tender; I &s;ay, with this Fleet the Pyrates left the Bay, and came to <HI>Port Mayo,</HI> in the Gulph of <HI>Montick,</HI> and there made Preparations to carreen; they carried a&s;hore their Sails, and made Tents by the Water-Side, wherein they laid their Plunder, Stores, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and fell to Work; and at the Time that the Ship was upon the Heel, and the good Folks employ'd in heaving down, &s;crubing, tallow|ing and &s;o forth; of a &s;udden came down a con&s;i|derable Body of the Natives, a 1000 or more, and Attacks the Pyrates unprepared. As they were in no Condition to defend them&s;elves, or repul&s;e their Enemies, they fled to their Sloops, leaving them Ma&s;ters of the Field and the Spoil thereof, which was of great Value. They &s;et Fire to the <HI>Happy Delivery,</HI> their capital Ship, and made off directly in two of the Sloops.</P>
<P><HI>Lowther</HI> made the be&s;t Provi&s;ion he could in the large&s;t Sloop, which he called the <HI>Ranger,</HI> having ten Guns, and eight Swivels, and &s;he &s;ailing be&s;t, the Company went all aboard of her, and left the other at Sea. Provi&s;ions was now very &s;hort, which, with the late Lo&s;s, put them in a confounded ill Humour, in&s;omuch that they were every now and then going together by the Ears, laying the blame of their ill Conduct &s;ometimes upon one, then up|on another.</P>
<P>The Beginning of <HI>May</HI> 1722, they got to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and near the I&s;land of <HI>Di&s;eada,</HI> took a Brigantine, one <HI>Payne</HI> Ma&s;ter, that afforded them what they &s;tood in need of, which put them in better Temper, and Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;eem'd to go on well again; after they had pretty well plun|dered the Brigantine, they &s;ent her to the Bottom. They went into the I&s;land and watered, and then &s;tood to the Northward, intending to vi&s;it the Main-Coa&s;t of <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="288">
In the Latitude of 38, <HI>May</HI> the 28th, they fell in with a Brigantine, called the <HI>Rebecca,</HI> of <HI>Charles-Town</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> bound to <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> from St. <HI>Chri&s;tophers, James Flecker</HI> Ma&s;ter; they made Prize of her, at which time old Differences reviv'd, and were much inflam'd by a bold hardy Fellow, <HI>viz. Low,</HI> who had the Ambition to be a Captain too; in &s;hort the Company was equally divided, 45 Hands went into the Brigantine la&s;t taken, where <HI>Low</HI> was made Commander, and <HI>Lowther</HI> pur&s;ued the Game, with the like Number of Hands in the Sloop. <HI>Lowther</HI> proceeding on his Way to the Main-Coa&s;t, took three or four fi&s;hing Ve&s;&s;els off <HI>New-York,</HI> which was no great Booty to the Captors. The 3d of <HI>June,</HI> they met with a &s;mall <HI>New-Eng|land</HI> Ship, bound home from <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> which &s;tood an Attack for a &s;mall Time, but finding it to no Purpo&s;e, yielded a Prey to the Booters: The Py|rates took out of her fourteen Hog&s;heads of Rum, &s;ix Barrels of Sugar, a large Box of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Goods, &s;everal Casks of Loaf Sugar, a con&s;iderable Quan|tity of Pepper, &s;ix Negroes, be&s;ides a Sum of Money, and Plate, and then let her go on her Voyage.</P>
<P>The next Adventure was not &s;o Fortunate for them, for coming pretty near the Coa&s;t of <HI>South-Carolina,</HI> they met with a Ship ju&s;t come out, on her Voyage to <HI>England; Lowther</HI> gave her a Gun, and hoi&s;ted his pyratical Colours; but this Ship, which was called the <HI>Amy,</HI> happening to have a brave gallant Man to command her, who was not any ways daunted with that terrible En&s;ign, the black Flag; in&s;tead of &s;triking immediately, as 'twas expected, let fly a Broad&s;ide at the Pyrate. <HI>Low|ther</HI> (not at all plea&s;ed with the Compliment, tho' he put up with it for the pre&s;ent,) was for taking Leave; but the <HI>Amy</HI> getting the Pyrate between her and the Shore, &s;tood after him to clap him aboard; to prevent which, <HI>Lowther</HI> run the Sloop a
<PB N="280" REF="289">
ground, and landed all the Men with their Arms. Captain <HI>Gwatkins,</HI> the Captain of the <HI>Amy,</HI> was obliged to &s;tand off, for fear of running his own Ship a&s;hore; but at the &s;ame Time, thought fit for the publick Good, to de&s;troy the Enemy; and thereupon went into the Boat, and rowed towards the Sloop, in order to &s;et her on Fire; but before he reached the Ve&s;&s;el, a fatal Shot from <HI>Lowther</HI>'s Company a&s;hore, put an End to their De&s;ign and Captain <HI>Gwatkin</HI>'s Life. After this unfortunate Blow, the Mate returned aboard with the Boat, and not being inclined to pur&s;ue them any farther, took Charge of the Ship.</P>
<P><HI>Lowther</HI> got off the Sloop after the Departure of the <HI>Amy,</HI> and brought all his Men aboard again, but was in a poor &s;hattered Condition, having &s;uffered much in the Engagement, and had a great many Men kill'd and wounded: He made Shift to get into an Inlet &s;omewhere in <HI>North-Carolina,</HI> where he &s;taid a long while before he was able to put to Sea again.</P>
<P><HI>Lowther</HI> and his Crew laid up all the Winter, and &s;hifted as well as they could among the Woods, divided them&s;elves into &s;mall Parties, and hunted generally in the Day-Times, killing of black Cat|tle, Hogs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for their Sub&s;i&s;tance, and in the Night retired to their Tents and Huts which they made for Lodging; and &s;ometimes when the Wea|ther grew very cold, they would &s;tay aboard of their Sloop.</P>
<P>In the Spring of the Year 1723, they made Shift to get to Sea, and &s;teer'd their Cour&s;e for <HI>New&s;ound|land,</HI> and upon the Banks took a Scooner, called the <HI>Swi&s;t, John Hood</HI> Ma&s;ter; they found a good Quantity of Provi&s;ions aboard her, which they very much wanted at that Time, and, after taking three of their Hands, and plundering her of what they thought fit, they let her depart. They took &s;e|veral
<PB N="281" REF="290">
other Ve&s;&s;els upon the Banks, and then went off to the <HI>Azores</HI> I&s;lands. In their Pa&s;&s;age thither, about 100 Leagues Ea&s;tward of <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> they met with a Brigantine called the <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Elizabeth, Richard Stanny</HI> Ma&s;ter, bound to <HI>Bo&s;ton:</HI> The Pyrates plundered her of &s;everal &s;orts of Goods and Mer|chandizes, and took away two of her Men, and then di&s;charged her.</P>
<P>At the <HI>Azores, Lowther</HI> and his old Companion <HI>Low</HI> met together, who &s;aluted one another with great Shot, fired high in the Air; they vi&s;ited the I&s;lands together, particularly <HI>Fyal</HI> and St. <HI>Michael,</HI> and took &s;everal Ships and Ve&s;&s;els belonging to the <HI>Portugue&s;e, French</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> they barbarou&s;ly u&s;ed &s;everal of the Ma&s;ters, cutting off their Ears and No&s;es, whipping and cutting them <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>From the <HI>Azores Lowther</HI> &s;ail'd towards the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> I&s;lands, but mi&s;&s;ing of them, and not being able to fetch any Windward Part of <HI>Africa,</HI> he was obliged to put away to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies;</HI> In which Voyage Provi&s;ions grew &s;hort, and the Company was forced to a very &s;mall Allowance. In <HI>Septem|ber</HI> the Pyrate came near <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and took a Ship called the <HI>Prince&s;s,</HI> Captain <HI>Wick&s;ted,</HI> from <HI>Gui|ney,</HI> which, after they had plunder'd her, they let go; but &s;ometime after that, in his Progre&s;s among the Leeward I&s;lands, he happened to cha&s;e a Sloop pretty near into St. <HI>Chri&s;tophers,</HI> and being foul could not come up with her. The Pyrates thought it now high Time to go in and clean; and accor|dingly the &s;mall I&s;land of <HI>Blanco</HI> was pitched upon, and there they arrived in the Beginning of <HI>Novem|ber</HI> la&s;t.</P>
<P>The Governor of St. <HI>Chri&s;tophers,</HI> who was always a vigilent Man, receiving Information of the Py|rate, by the Sloop that was cha&s;ed into the Har|bour of that I&s;land, &s;traitway fitted out a large Sloop, well mann'd and arm'd, called the <HI>Eagle,</HI> and
<PB N="282" REF="291">
gave a Commi&s;&s;ion to one Colonel <HI>Otley,</HI> of the &s;aid I&s;land, to go in que&s;t of her; and after a Crui&s;e of ten or twelve Days, came to the I&s;land where <HI>Lowther</HI> was carreening: The Pyrates were in no Condition to make any Re&s;i&s;tance, and &s;o upon Sight of the Colonel's Sloop, every Man &s;hifted for him&s;elf, and for the mo&s;t Part fled up into the Woods, &s;o that few of them were taken. The Colonel brought the Sloop away, and left <HI>Lowther</HI> and the Crew, behind upon the I&s;land, where we al&s;o for the pre&s;ent mu&s;t leave them.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. OF Captain <HI>Edward Low,</HI> And his CREW.</HEAD>
<P><HI>EDward Low</HI> was born in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> and had his Education there, &s;uch as it was, for he could neither write or read. Nature &s;eem'd to have de&s;igned him for a Pyrate from his Child|hood, for very early he began the Trade of plun|dering, and was wont to rai&s;e Contributions among all the Boys of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter;</HI> and if any were bold enough to refu&s;e it, a Battle was the Con&s;equence; but <HI>Low</HI> was &s;o hardy, as well as bold, there was no getting the better of him, &s;o that he robbed the Youths of their Farthings with Impunity;
<PB N="283" REF="292">
when he grew bigger he took to Gaming in a low Way, for it was commonly among the Footmen in the <HI>Lobby</HI> of the Hou&s;e of Commons, where he u&s;ed to play the whole Game, (as they term it,) that is, cheat all he could, and tho&s;e who pretend|ed to di&s;pute it with him, mu&s;t fight him.</P>
<P>The Virtues of &s;ome of his Family were equal to his; one of his Brothers was a Youth of Genius, when he was but &s;even Years old, he u&s;ed to be carried in a Basket, upon a Porter's Back, into a Crowd, and &s;natch Hats and Wigs; according to the exact Chronology of <HI>Newgate,</HI> he was the fir&s;t who practiced this ingenious Trick. After this, he applied him&s;elf to picking of Pockets; when he increa&s;ed in Strength, he attempted greater Things, &s;uch as Hou&s;e-breaking, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But after he had run a &s;hort Race, he had the Misfortune of ending his Days at <HI>Tyburn,</HI> in Company with <HI>Stephen Bunce,</HI> and the celebrated <HI>Jack Hall</HI> the Chimney-Sweeper.</P>
<P>But to return to <HI>Ned,</HI> when he came to Man's E&s;tate, at his elde&s;t Brother's De&s;ire, he went to Sea with him, and &s;o continued for three or four Years, and then parted; and <HI>Ned</HI> work'd in a Rig|ging-Hou&s;e in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> for a while. About &s;ix Years ago, he took a Trip home to <HI>Eng|land,</HI> to &s;ee his Mother, who is yet Living. His &s;tay was not long here, but taking Leave of his Friends and Acquaintance, for the la&s;t Time he &s;hould &s;ee them, for &s;o he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, he returned to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and worked a Year or two lon|ger at the Rigging Bu&s;ine&s;s, but being too apt to di&s;agree with his Ma&s;ters, he left them, and &s;hipp'd him&s;elf in a Sloop that was bound to the Bay of <HI>Honduras.</HI></P>
<P>When the Sloop arrived in the Bay, <HI>Ned Low</HI> was appointed Patron of the Boat, which was em|ploy'd in the cutting of Logwood, and bringing
<PB N="284" REF="293">
it aboard to lade the Ship, for that is the Commo|dity they make the Voyage for: In the Boat were twelve Men be&s;ides <HI>Low,</HI> who all go arm'd, be|cau&s;e of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> from whom this Logwood is but little better than &s;tole. It happened that the Boat one Day came aboard ju&s;t before Dinner was ready, and <HI>Low</HI> de&s;ired that they might &s;tay and Dine; but the Captain being in a hurry for his Lading, ordered them a Bottle of Rum, and to take 'tother Trip, becau&s;e no Time &s;hould be lo&s;t: This provoked the Boat's Crew, but particularly <HI>Low,</HI> who takes up a loaded Mu&s;quet and fires at the Captain, but mi&s;&s;ed him, and &s;hot another poor Fellow thro' the Head, then put of the Boat, and with his twelve Companions goes to Sea: The next Day they took a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el, and go in her, make a black Flag, and declared War again&s;t all the World.</P>
<P>In a few Days, <HI>Lowther</HI> the Pyrate &s;tanding in towards the Bay of <HI>Honduras, Low</HI> falls in Company with him, and after a Compliment, they join to|gether, and go all aboard the &s;ame Ve&s;&s;el, which is already taken Notice of in the Hi&s;tory of <HI>George Lowther,</HI> al&s;o what happen'd under <HI>Lowther</HI>'s Com|mand, to the Time of their Separation, to which we refer the Reader.</P>
<P>The latter End of <HI>May</HI> 1722, the Crew under the &s;aid <HI>Lowther</HI> took a Brigantine of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> bound thither from St. <HI>Chri&s;tophers,</HI> at which Time they parted, and <HI>Edward Low</HI> was one that went into the Brigantine, with 44 others, and cho&s;e their Captain: They took with them two Guns, four Swivels, &s;ix Quarter-Casks of Powder, Provi&s;ions and &s;ome Stores, and &s;o left <HI>Lowther</HI> to pro&s;ecute his Adventures, with the Men he had left.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Adventure that happened to our new Captain in the Brigantine, was on <HI>Sunday</HI> the 3d Day of <HI>June,</HI> when they took a Ve&s;&s;el belonging
<PB N="285" REF="294">
to <HI>Amboy, John Hance</HI> Ma&s;ter, whom he rifled of his Provi&s;ions and let go; the &s;ame Day he met with a Sloop, <HI>James Calquhoon</HI> Ma&s;ter, off of <HI>Rhode I&s;land,</HI> bound into that Port, whom he fir&s;t plun|dred, and then cut away his Bolt&s;prit, and all his Rigging, al&s;o his Sails from the Yards, and wound|ed the Ma&s;ter, to prevent his getting in to give In|telligence, and then &s;tood away to the South-Ea&s;t|ward, with all the Sail he could make, there being then but little Wind.</P>
<P><HI>Low</HI> judged right in making &s;ail from the Coa&s;t, for a longer &s;tay had proved fatal to him, for notwith&s;tanding the di&s;abled Condition he had rendered the Sloop in, &s;he made &s;hift to get into <HI>Block I&s;land,</HI> at 12 o'Clock that Night, and imme|diately di&s;patch'd a Whale-Boat to <HI>Rhode I&s;land,</HI> which got thither by &s;even the next Morning, with an Account of the Pyrate, his Force, and what had happened to him: As &s;oon as the Governor had received this Information, he ordered a Drum to beat up for Volunteers, and two of the be&s;t Sloops then in the Harbour, to be fitted out, and gave Commi&s;&s;ions to one Captain <HI>John Headland,</HI> and Captain <HI>John Brown</HI> jun. for ten Days; the former had eight Guns and two Swivels, and the latter &s;ix Guns, well fitted with &s;mall Arms, and in both Sloops 140 &s;tout Fellows; all this was performed with &s;o much Expedition, that before Sun-&s;et, they were under Sail turning out of the Harbour, at the &s;ame Time the Pyrate was &s;een from <HI>Block I&s;land,</HI> which gave great Hopes that the Sloops would be Ma&s;ters of her the next Day, which however did not happen, for the Sloops re|turned into Harbour &s;ome Days afterwards with|out &s;o much as &s;eeing their Enemy.</P>
<P>After this E&s;cape, Captain <HI>Low,</HI> went into Port, upon the Coa&s;t, for he had not fre&s;h Water enough to run to the I&s;lands, where he &s;taid &s;ome Time,
<PB N="286" REF="295">
getting Provi&s;ions and what Nece&s;&s;aries the Crew wanted, and then &s;ail'd for Purcha&s;e, (as they call it,) &s;teering their Cour&s;e towards <HI>Marble-head.</HI></P>
<P>About the 12th of <HI>July,</HI> the Brigantine &s;ail'd into the Harbour of Port <HI>Ro&s;emary,</HI> and found thir|teen Ships and Ve&s;&s;els, but none of Force, at Anchor, &s;o they immediately &s;pread their black Flag, and ran in among them; <HI>Low</HI> called to them from the Brigantine, and told them, they &s;hould have no Quarters if they re&s;i&s;ted; in the mean Time they mann'd and arm'd their Boat, and took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every one of them, plundered them of what they thought fit, and converted one to their own U&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> a Scooner of 80 Tuns, aboard of which they put 10 Carriage Guns, and 50 Men, and <HI>Low</HI> him&s;elf went Captain, and nam'd her the <HI>Fancy,</HI> making one <HI>Charles Harris,</HI> (who was at fir&s;t forced into their Service out of the <HI>Greyhound</HI> of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> Captain <HI>Edwards,</HI> by <HI>Lowther,</HI> of which Ship <HI>Harris</HI> was &s;econd Mate) Captain of the Bri|gantine. Out of the&s;e Ve&s;&s;els they took &s;everal Hands, and encrea&s;ed the Company to 80 Men, who all &s;igned the Articles, &s;ome willingly, and a few perhaps by Force, and &s;o &s;ailed away from <HI>Marblehead.</HI></P>
<P>Some Time after this, they met with two Sloops bound for <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> with Provi&s;ions for the Garri&s;on, and the Scooner coming up fir&s;t, attack'd them, but there happening to be an Officer and &s;ome Sol|diers on Board, who gave them &s;uch a Reception, that <HI>Low</HI> did not think it prudent to concern him|&s;elf any farther with them, till he was joyn'd by the Brigantine; in the mean while the Sloops made the be&s;t of their Way, and the Pyrates gave them Chace two Days, and at la&s;t lo&s;t &s;ight of them in a Fog.</P>
<P>They now &s;teered away for the Leeward I&s;lands, but in their Voyage met with &s;uch a Hurricane of
<PB N="287" REF="296">
Wind, that the like had not been known; the Sea ran Mountains high, and &s;eem'd to threaten them every Moment with De&s;truction; it was no Time now to look out for Plunder, but to &s;ave them&s;elves, if po&s;&s;ible, from peri&s;hing. All Hands were continually employed Night and Day on Board the Brigantine, and all little enough, for the Waves went over her, &s;o that the Pump was forced to be kept con&s;tantly going, be&s;ides baling with Buckets; but finding them&s;elves not able to keep her free, and &s;eeing the utmo&s;t Danger before them, they turned to the Takle and hoi&s;ted out their Provi&s;ions and other heavy Goods, and threw them over-board, with &s;ix of their Guns, &s;o that by lightening the Ve&s;&s;el, &s;he might ri&s;e to the Top of the Sea with the Waves; they were al&s;o going to cut away their Ma&s;t, but con&s;idering how dan|gerous it would be, to be left in &s;uch a Condition, they re&s;olved to delay it to the la&s;t, which was prudent in them &s;o to do; for a Ship without Ma&s;ts or Sails, lies like a Log upon the Water, and if at|tack'd, mu&s;t fight with Di&s;advantage, for in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, the working of a Ship is the mo&s;t artful Part of the Engagement, becau&s;e &s;he may &s;ometimes bring all her great Guns on one Side, to bear upon her Enemy, when the di&s;abled Ship can do little or nothing.</P>
<P>But to proceed; by their throwing over-board the heavy Goods, the Ve&s;&s;el made con&s;iderable le&s;s Water, and they could keep it under with the Pump only, which gave them Hopes and new Life; &s;o that in&s;tead of cutting all away, they took ne|ce&s;&s;ary Mea&s;ures to &s;ecure the Ma&s;t, by making Preventor-Shrowds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and then Wore and lay too upon the other Tack, till the Storm was over. The Scooner made &s;omewhat better Weather of it, of the two, but was pretty roughly handled notwith|&s;tanding, having &s;plit her Main&s;ail, &s;prung her Bolt&s;prit, and was forced to cut her Anchors from
<PB N="288" REF="297">
her Bows. The Brigantine by running away to Lee|ward, when &s;he wore upon the Larboard Tack, had lo&s;t Sight of the Scooner; but not knowing whe|ther &s;he might be &s;afe or not, as &s;oon as the Wind abated, &s;he &s;et her Main-Sail and Top-Sail, and made &s;hort Trips to Windward; and the next Day had the good Fortune to come in Sight of their Con&s;ort, who upon a Signal, which the other knew, bore down to her, and the Crew were over|joy'd to meet again, after &s;uch an ill Treatment from the Winds and Seas.</P>
<P>After the Storm, <HI>Low</HI> got &s;afe to a &s;mall I&s;land, one of the Weathermo&s;t of the <HI>Carribees,</HI> and there fitted their Ve&s;&s;els, as well as the Place could af|ford; they got Provi&s;ions of the Natives, in ex|change for Goods of their own; and as &s;oon as the Brigantine was ready, 'twas judg'd nece&s;&s;ary to take a &s;hort Cruize, and leave the Scooner in the Harbour, till her Return. The Brigantine &s;ail'd out accordingly, and had not been out many Days before they met a Ship at Sea, that had lo&s;t all her Ma&s;ts; on Board of whom they went, and took from her in Money and Goods, to the Value of 2000 l. and &s;o left her in the Condition they found her: This Ship was bound home from <HI>Bar|badoes,</HI> but lo&s;ing her Ma&s;ts in the late Storm, was making for <HI>Antegoa,</HI> to refit, where &s;he after|wards arriv'd.</P>
<P>The Storm ju&s;t &s;poken of, was found to have done incredible Damage in tho&s;e Parts of the World; but, however it appeared to have been more violent at <HI>Jamaica,</HI> both to the I&s;land and Shipping, there was &s;uch a prodigious Swell of the Sea, that &s;everal hundred Tuns of Stones and Rocks, were throw nover the Wall of the Town of <HI>Port Royal,</HI> and the Town it &s;elf was over-flowed, and above half de&s;troy'd, there being the next Morning five Foot Water from one End to the other; the Cannon of

<P>The Brigantine returning to the I&s;land, where &s;he had left the Scooner, who being ready to &s;ail, it was put to the Vote of the Company, what Voyage to take next; and herein they followed the Advice of the Captain, who thought it not advi&s;e|able to go any farther to Leeward, becau&s;e of the Men of War, who were crui&s;ing in their &s;everal Stations, which they were not at all fond of meet|ing, and therefore it was agreed to go to the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> I&s;lands, and afterwards vi&s;it the Logwood Cutters, in the Bay of <HI>Honduras.</HI></P>
<P>Some Time in <HI>November</HI> 1722, they got in with the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> I&s;lands, and crui&s;ing to the Ea&s;tward of them, they took two Ships coming from <HI>Lisbon,</HI> one <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and the other <HI>French,</HI> bound to St. <HI>Mi|chaels,</HI> the Commanders Names were <HI>Chandler</HI> and <HI>Roach:</HI> They plundered them of &s;everal Sorts of Goods, Provi&s;ions and Stores, and let them go; but meeting with an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pink bound to the &s;ame Place, with &s;everal Pa&s;&s;engers on Board, who were willing to fight for what they had, they in|humanly murthered three or four of them, when they came on Board, tho' they let the Ship pro|ceed on her Voyage.</P>
<P>After the taking of the&s;e Ships, they went into one of the I&s;lands, and took in fre&s;h Water; when they came out again, they &s;eized at <HI>Bonavi&s;ta,</HI> a Ship call'd the <HI>Liverpool Merchant,</HI> Captain <HI>Goulding;</HI> they took from her a great Quantity of Provi&s;ions and dry Goods, 300 Gallons of Brandy, two Guns and Carriages, a Ma&s;t, Yard, and Haw&s;ers, and &s;ix of
<PB N="290" REF="299">
their Men; after which they would not &s;uffer them to trade there, or at St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> with what they had left, but forced Captain <HI>Goulding</HI> to go to the I&s;le of <HI>May</HI> with his Ship.</P>
<P>Some Days afterwards, they took another Ship belonging to <HI>Leverpool,</HI> the Ma&s;ter's Name <HI>Scot,</HI> whom they plunder'd of what Things they thought fit, and then &s;uffered her to pur&s;ue her Voyage. They al&s;o took among the &s;aid I&s;lands two <HI>Portu|gue&s;e</HI> Sloops, bound for <HI>Brazil,</HI> a &s;mall <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Sloop trading there, <HI>James Pea&s;e</HI> Ma&s;ter, a Sloop bound to <HI>Sancta Cruz,</HI> and three Sloops from St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> bound to <HI>Cura&s;o,</HI> whereof <HI>Lilly, Staples</HI> and <HI>Simpkins</HI> were Ma&s;ters, all which they plundered, and then &s;ail'd from that Station, towards the Coa&s;t of <HI>New-York, New England, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>They had hardly lo&s;t Sight of the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> I&s;lands, before they gave Chace to a Sail, and came up with her, which proved to be a <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> and a rich Prize; &s;he was call'd the <HI>No&s;tra Signiora de Victoria,</HI> the Commander, Captain <HI>Rodrigues,</HI> bound to <HI>Bahia</HI> from <HI>Viana;</HI> they di&s;patch'd her with all convenient Speed, and &s;tood away as before. When they came in the Latitude of 33 Degrees, which is in the trade Way of the Ve&s;&s;els, between <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>Jamaica,</HI> they cruiz'd off and on for &s;ome Time, and intercepted &s;everal in their Voyage, <HI>viz.</HI> a Snow from <HI>New-York</HI> to <HI>Curacoa, Robert Leonard</HI> Ma|&s;ter; a Sloop from the Bay, bound to <HI>New-York, Craig</HI> Ma&s;ter; a Snow from <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Jamaica,</HI> bound to <HI>New-York;</HI> and the <HI>Stanhope</HI> Pink, <HI>Andrew Delbridge</HI> Ma&s;ter, from <HI>Jamaica</HI> to <HI>Bo&s;ton;</HI> which la&s;t they burnt, becau&s;e of <HI>Low</HI>'s irreconcileable Aver&s;ion to <HI>New-England</HI> Men; among whom he had lived for &s;ome Time, as has been before taken Notice of, and who being of a vindictive Temper, could never forgive a Per&s;on from whom he ima|gined to have received Injuries; and as his Be|haviour
<PB N="291" REF="300">
had merited no extraordinary Treatment at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> &s;o he met with U&s;age accordingly, and now he pro&s;ecuted his Revenge again&s;t all of that Coun|try, where ever he met them.</P>
<P>About the Middle of <HI>March</HI> 1722-3, Captain <HI>Low,</HI> with the Scooner, Brigantine, and a Sloop lately ta|ken, entered the Bay of <HI>Honduras,</HI> where he met a Sloop turning out of the &s;aid Bay. The Pyrates had hoi&s;ted up <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Colours, and &s;o continued them 'till they drew near the Sloop, when they hall'd them down, hoi&s;ted their black Flag, fired a Broad|&s;ide, and boarded her. This Sloop was a <HI>Spaniard</HI> of &s;ix Guns, and &s;eventy Men, that came into the Bay that Morning, and meeting there with five <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Sloops, and a Pink, made Prizes of them all, plundered them, and brought the Ma&s;ters of the Ve&s;&s;els away Pri&s;oners, in order to ran&s;om for the Logwood, and confin'd them in the Hold; their Names were <HI>Tuthill, Norton, Newbury, Sprafort, Clark</HI> and <HI>Parrot.</HI> The <HI>Spaniards</HI> made no Re&s;i&s;tance, &s;o that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pyrates &s;oon became their Ma|&s;ters, and fell to rifling; but finding &s;everal <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Goods on Board, they con&s;ulted <HI>Low</HI> the Captain thereupon, and without examining any further, the Re&s;olution pa&s;s'd to kill all the Company; and the Pyrates, without any Ceremony, fell Pell-Mell to Exe|cution with their Swords, Cutla&s;hes, Poll-Axes and Pi&s;tols, cutting, &s;la&s;hing and &s;hooting the poor <HI>Spa|niards</HI> at a &s;ad Rate. Some of the mi&s;erable Creatures jump'd down into the Hold, but could not avoid the Ma&s;&s;acre; they met Death every where, for if they e&s;caped it from one Hand, they were &s;ure to peri&s;h by another; the only Pro&s;pect they had of Life, was to fly from the Rage of tho&s;e mercile&s;s Men, and to tru&s;t to the more merciful Sea; and accordingly a great many leap'd over-board, and &s;wam for the Shore; which <HI>Low</HI> perceiving, ordered the Canoa to be mann'd, and
<PB N="292" REF="301">
&s;ent in pur&s;uit of them, and &s;o murdered &s;everal in the Water, as they were endeavouring to get to the Land; however about twelve of them did reach the Shore, but in a mi&s;erable Condition, be|ing very much wounded, and what became of them afterwards was not known, except one, who fell into the Pyrate's Hands, as they were rioting and making them&s;elves merry at the Watering-Place. This poor Man had received &s;everal de&s;pe|rate Wounds, and finding him&s;elf weak, without Sub&s;i&s;tence or Remedies, he came down to 'em, and beg'd for Je&s;us &s;ake for Quarters; upon which, one of the Villains took hold of him, and &s;aid, <HI>G&mdash;d d&mdash;n him, he would give him good Quarters pre&s;ently,</HI> and made the poor <HI>Spaniard</HI> kneel down on his Knees, then taking his Fu&s;il, put the Muzzle of it into his Mouth, and fired down his Throat, which put an End to his unhappy Life. 'Twas thought the re&s;t did not long &s;urvive their mi&s;era|ble Condition, and could only prolong their Lives, to add to the Mi&s;ery of them.</P>
<P>When this bloody Piece of Work was over, they rumaged the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Pyrate, and brought all the Booty aboard their own Ve&s;&s;els: The &s;ix Ma&s;ters aforementioned, found in the Hold, they re&s;tored to their re&s;pective Ve&s;&s;els, but murder'd one <HI>Wickam</HI> a <HI>New-Englard</HI> Ma&s;ter, for Country &s;ake: They forced away the Carpenter from the Pink, and then &s;et Fire to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Sloop, and burnt her; which la&s;t Scene concluded the De&s;truction of their Enemy, Ship and Crew.</P>
<P>The Ma&s;ters of the Ve&s;&s;els, and <HI>Low,</HI> with the re&s;t of the Pyrates, corre&s;ponded freely together, and mutual Civilities pa&s;&s;ed between them for &s;ome Days, till they &s;ail'd; but the Rovers would not &s;uffer them to &s;teer for <HI>Jamaica,</HI> where they were then bound, for fear the Men of War &s;hould get
<PB N="293" REF="302">
Intelligence of them, but forced them all to go to <HI>New-York,</HI> threat'ning them with Death, when they met them again, if they refu&s;ed to comply with their Demands.</P>
<P>In the next Cruize, which was between the Lee|ward I&s;lands and the Main, they took two Snows, bound from <HI>Jamaica</HI> to <HI>Liverpool,</HI> and a Snow from <HI>Jamaica</HI> to <HI>London, Bridds</HI> Ma&s;ter; as al&s;o a Ship from <HI>Biddiford</HI> to <HI>Jamaica, John Pinkham</HI> Comman|der; and two Sloops from <HI>Jamaica</HI> to <HI>Virginia.</HI></P>
<P>On the 27th of <HI>May, Low,</HI> and his Con&s;ort <HI>Har|ris,</HI> came off <HI>South-Carolina,</HI> and met with three good Ships, <HI>viz.</HI> The Crown, Captain <HI>Lovereigne,</HI> the <HI>King William,</HI> the <HI>Carteret,</HI> and a Brigantine, who all came out of <HI>Carolina</HI> together two Days before. The Pyrates were at the trouble of chacing them, and Captain <HI>Lovereigne</HI> being the &s;ternmo&s;t, &s;he fell fir&s;t a Prey into their Hands; and they &s;pent all the Day in coming up with the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Within few Days, <HI>Low</HI> took a Ship, called, the <HI>Am&s;terdam Merchant,</HI> Captain <HI>Willard,</HI> from <HI>Jamai|ca,</HI> but belonging to <HI>New-England,</HI> as <HI>Low</HI> let none of tho&s;e depart without &s;ome Marks of his Rage, he cut off this Gentleman's Ears, &s;lit up his No&s;e, and cut him in &s;everal other Places of his Body, and, after plundering his Ship, let him pur&s;ue his Voyage.</P>
<P>Many other vile Actions were done about this Time by <HI>Low,</HI> upon the Coa&s;t, where he daily met with Spoil, which did not alone &s;atisfy his inhu|mane Temper, but, as it were, grew wanton in his Cruelties, putting Men to the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Tor|tures, if their Behaviour, or even Looks di&s;plea&s;ed him. He ty'd lighted Matches between Men's Fingers belonging to a Sloop bound in to <HI>Am|boy,</HI> whereof <HI>William Frazier</HI> was Ma&s;ter, till the Fle&s;h was all burnt off: He cut &s;ome with Knives and Cutla&s;hes, and took all their Provi&s;ions away;
<PB N="294" REF="303">
and others he &s;et a&s;hore in an uninhabited Part o$ the Country.</P>
<P>The <HI>King&s;ton,</HI> Captain <HI>Ea&s;twick,</HI> another Ship, on <HI>Burrington</HI> Ma&s;ter, two Brigantines from <HI>Carolina</HI> $t <HI>London;</HI> a Sloop from <HI>Virginia</HI> to <HI>Bermudas;</HI> a Ship from <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> to <HI>Virginia;</HI> a Scooner from <HI>New-York</HI> $$ <HI>South-Carolina;</HI> a Pink from <HI>Virginia</HI> to <HI>Dartmouth;</HI> $Word$ a Sloop from <HI>Philadelphia</HI> to <HI>Surinam,</HI> fell a Prey to the&s;e Villains, upon this Cruize, be&s;ides tho&s;e above mentioned.</P>
<P>It happened that at this Time, one of his Maje&s;ty's Ships was upon a Cruize, on this Station, and got Intelligence of &s;ome of the mi&s;chievous Actions of this Mi&s;creant, by one of the Ve&s;&s;els that had been plundered by him, who &s;teering as directed, came in Sight of the Pyrates by break of Day, on the 10th of <HI>June,</HI> of all Days in the Year. The Rovers looking out for Prey, &s;oon &s;aw, and gave Chace to the Man of War, which was called the <HI>Greyhound,</HI> a Ship of 20 Guns and 120 Men, rather inferiour in Force to the two Pyrate Sloops: The <HI>Greyhound</HI> finding them &s;o eager, was in no doubt what they &s;hould be, and therefore tack'd and &s;tood from them, giving the Pyrates an Opportu|nity to chace her for two Hours, till all Things were in Readine&s;s for an Engagement, and the Pyrates about Gun-Shot off; then the <HI>Greyhound</HI> tack'd again and &s;tood towards the two Sloops, one of them called the <HI>Fancy,</HI> commanded by <HI>Low</HI> him|&s;elf, and the other the <HI>Ranger,</HI> commanded by one <HI>Harris,</HI> both which hoi&s;ted their pyratical Co|lours, and fired each a Gun. When the <HI>Grey|hound</HI> came within Mu&s;quet-Shot, &s;he halled up her Main-Sail, and clapp'd clo&s;e upon a Wind, to keep the Pyrates from running to Leeward, and then engaged; but when the Rogues found who they had to deal with, they edg'd away under the Man of War's Stern, and the <HI>Greyhound</HI> &s;tanding after
<PB N="295" REF="304">
them, they made a running Fight for about two Hours; but little Wind happening, the Sloops gain|ed from her, by the help of their Oars; upon which the <HI>Greyhound</HI> left off firing, and turned all Hands to her own Oars, and at three in the Afternoon came up with them. The Pyrates halled upon a Wind to receive the Man of War, and the Fight was immediately renewed, with a brisk Fire on both Sides, till the <HI>Ranger</HI>'s Main-Yard was &s;hot down, and the <HI>Greyhound</HI> pre&s;&s;ing clo&s;e upon the di&s;abled Sloop, <HI>Low,</HI> in the other, thought fit to bear away and leave his Con&s;ort a Sacrifice to his Enemy, who (&s;eeing the Cowardice and Trea|chery of his Commadore and Leader, having ten or twelve Men kill'd and wounded, and that there was no po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;caping,) called out for <HI>Quar|ters,</HI> and &s;urrendered them&s;elves to Ju&s;tice, which proved &s;evere enough to them a-while after|wards.</P>
<P>The Conduct of <HI>Low</HI> was &s;urprizing in this Ad|venture, becau&s;e his reputed Courage and Bold|ne&s;s, had, hitherto, &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the Minds of all People, that he became a Terror, even to his own Men; but his Behaviour through this whole Action, &s;hewed him to be a ba&s;e cowardly Villain; for had <HI>Low</HI>'s Sloop fought half &s;o briskly as <HI>Harris</HI>'s did, and had &s;tood as clo&s;e to the Bu&s;ine&s;s, (as they were under a &s;olemn Oath to do,) the Man of War could never have hurted them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Greyhound</HI> carried in their Prize to <HI>Rhode I&s;land,</HI> to the great Joy of the whole Province, tho' it had been more compleat, if the great <HI>LOW</HI> him|&s;elf had grac'd the Triumph. The Pri&s;oners were &s;trongly &s;ecured in a Goal, till a Court of Vice-Admiralty could be held for their Tryals, which begun on the 10th of <HI>July,</HI> at <HI>Newport,</HI> and continu|ed three Days.

his Re&s;entments; and the bloody Mon&s;ter had near Hand been as good as his Word, if his own Companions had not put &s;ome Con&s;traint upon his Actions. In this Flight he met with a Sloop be|longing to <HI>Nantucket,</HI> a Whale-Fi&s;hing, about 80 Miles from Land; the Ma&s;ter of which, one <HI>Na|than Skiff,</HI> a brisk young Fellow, the Pyrates cruel|ly whipp'd naked about the Deck, making his Torture their Sport; after which they cut off his Ears, and la&s;t of all, Shot him thro' the Head, and then &s;unk his Ve&s;&s;el; putting the re&s;t of the Hands into their Whale-Boat, with a Compa&s;s, a little Water, and a few Biskets; and it being good Weather, they providentialy got &s;afe to <HI>Nantucket,</HI> beyond all Expectation.</P>
<P>There was another Whale-Boat belonging to the Sloop la&s;t mentioned, which happened to be at &s;ome Di&s;tance from her, and perceiving what was doing, rowed with all &s;peed to another Sloop not far off, to acquaint her with the Misfortune, that the Men might take Care of them&s;elves; and &s;he happily got away in Time. Some Days after, <HI>Low</HI> took a Fi&s;hing-Boat off of <HI>Block I&s;land,</HI> but did not perpetrate &s;o much Cruelty to her, contenting him&s;elf with only cutting off the Ma&s;ter's Head; but after taking two Whale Boats near <HI>Rhode I&s;land,</HI> he cau&s;ed one of the Ma&s;ter's Body to be rip'd up, and his Intrails to be taken out; and cut off the Ears of the other, and made him eat them him|&s;elf with Pepper and Salt; which hard Injun|ction he complyed with, without making a Word-Several other Per&s;ons he would have murthered, but Humanity prevailing in the tender Hearts of his Companions, they refu&s;ed to put his &s;avage Orders in Execution.</P>
<P>From the Coa&s;t of <HI>New-England, Low</HI> &s;ailed di|rectly for <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> and, near Cape <HI>Briton,</HI> took two, or three and twenty <HI>French</HI> Ve&s;&s;els; and one

of them of 22 Guns he mann'd with Pyrates, making a &s;ort of a Man of War of her, and &s;cour|ing the Harbours and Banks of <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> took &s;ixteen or eighteen other Ships and Ve&s;&s;els, all which they plundered, and &s;ome de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>In this Cruiz$ <HI>Low</HI> fell &s;ick and dy'd, as I am in|formed, tho' I am apt to believe he was cut off by &s;ome of his Crew, who lately grew weary of his in&s;olent and tyrannical Government. He was thirty eight Years of Age, a &s;trong well &s;et Man, not tall, but big boned: His Cruelty and Inhuma|nity to Pri&s;oners that fell into his Hands, was not &s;o generally approved of by there&s;t of the Pyrates, how|ever criminal they might be in other Re&s;pects; nor indeed could all his Barbarities be related, much le&s;s beheld without giving Nature a Shock. Among all the lawle&s;s Rulers of the Sea, never any came up to him in Cruelty, nor did the dying Groans of tho&s;e he butchered give him Compunction, or move any Pa&s;&s;ion in the Brute, but Anger, Rage and Scorn: Even in his good Humours a Man could not a&s;&s;ure him&s;elf of Safety from him, for Danger lurked in his very Smiles; as for In&s;tance, at the taking of a <HI>Virginia</HI> Man, Captain <HI>Graves,</HI> the Ma&s;ter of her, came on Board his Sloop, and at the fir&s;t Salutation, <HI>Low</HI> takes a &s;mall Bowl of Punch in his Hand, and drinks to him, &s;aying, <HI>Captain</HI> Graves, <HI>here is half this to you.</HI> But the poor Gentleman being grieved at the Misfortune of fall|ing into his Hands, mode&s;tly de&s;ired to be excu|&s;ed; whereupon <HI>Low</HI> draws out a Pi&s;tol, and cocks it, and taking the Bowl in 'tother Hand, &s;wore he &s;hould either take one or the other; &s;o <HI>Graves</HI> with|out any He&s;itation, made choice of the Vehicle that contained the Punch, and guttled down about a Quart, when he had the lea&s;t Inclination in the World to be merry.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="312">
Another Time when <HI>Low</HI> met with a Ve&s;&s;el be|longing to the Royal <HI>African</HI> Company, he asked &s;everal frivolous Que&s;tions concerning the Gover|nor and Directors of that Company, and made the Men kneel down, and drink Confu&s;ion and Dam&mdash;n to them all, and to the Duke of <HI>Chandois,</HI> in parti|cular; and afterwards told the Men, as they were employ'd in that Service, (meaning the Compa|ny's,) and who con&s;equently were their Ma&s;ters, they ought to behave them&s;elves with all the Re&s;pect and Duty that was nece&s;&s;ary towards them; and then made them drink the Duke's and all the re&s;t of their Healths, and to the Company's Pro&s;|perity, in the &s;ame Po&s;ture as when they were obliged to cur&s;e them. Several other idle and fooli&s;h Frolicks were frequently play'd by <HI>Low</HI> and his Companions, but we &s;hall wave them, and ha&s;ten to the Conclu&s;ion of our Story.</P>
<P>In the Room of <HI>Low,</HI> another Captain was made, not &s;o moro&s;e in his Temper, nor cruel in the Execution of their Villanies, but what his Name is, I have not learned. The Pyrates &s;ailed from <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> to the I&s;lands of <HI>Azores,</HI> in <HI>September</HI> la&s;t, and there came in Company with <HI>Lowther,</HI> with whom they &s;cower'd all the little I&s;lands, and took a Number of Ships and Ve&s;&s;els. They &s;ailed into <HI>Fyal,</HI> where &s;ix or &s;even Ships and Ve&s;|&s;els lay at Anchor, three of them <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> of Force, but no &s;ooner their black Flag appear'd, but they &s;truck and yeilded to the Pyrates Mercy. At other Harbours they &s;ent in their Boats, and brought the Ve&s;&s;els out, while the Ship and Sloop were crui&s;ing off the I&s;land. The&s;e Tran&s;actions of the Rovers greatly enraged the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> and made them &s;u&s;pect every <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;el to be a Pyrate, which had like to have proved fatal to one Captain <HI>Tillingha&s;t,</HI> who happened to come into <HI>Fyal,</HI> a few Days after the Pyrates had vi&s;ited that Harbour,

and knowing nothing of the Matter, was &s;urpri|zed with &s;everal Shot from the Town, in&s;omuch, that he was obliged to lower his Sails and come to, and go a&s;hore with a few Hands: He was &s;ent to Goal, and Orders given to &s;earch his Ve&s;&s;el; his Che&s;t of Papers were brought on Shore and peru|&s;ed by &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants and others; but not finding any Thing whereby they might ac|cu&s;e him of Pyracy, he was at length &s;et at Liberty.</P>
<P><HI>Lowther</HI> &s;ailed from the <HI>Azores,</HI> to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and the Crew lately under <HI>Low,</HI> &s;teered to the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> I&s;lands, where we do not find any great Matters were done, but &s;ailing thence, they arrived upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guiney,</HI> where, about <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> la&s;t, they took the <HI>Delight,</HI> Captain <HI>Hunt,</HI> and <HI>Squirrel,</HI> Captain <HI>Stephen&s;on,</HI> which is the la&s;t News we have heard concerning them.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. OF Capt. <HI>JOHN EVANS,</HI> And his CREW.</HEAD>
<P><HI>JOhn Evans</HI> was a <HI>Welch</HI> Man, had been formerly Ma&s;ter of a Sloop belonging to <HI>Nevis,</HI> but lo&s;ing his Employ there, he &s;ailed for &s;ome Time out of <HI>Jamaica</HI> as Mate, till happening in Company of three or four of his Comrades, and Wages not being &s;o good as formerly, and Birth's &s;carce, be|cau&s;e of the great Number of Seamen; they agreed to go abroad in &s;earch of Adventures. They &s;ailed, or rather row'd out of <HI>Port Royal,</HI> in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> the latter End of <HI>September</HI> 1722, in a Canoa; and com|ing on the North-Side of the I&s;land, went a&s;hore in the Night, broke open a Hou&s;e or two, and rob'd them of &s;ome Money, and every Thing el&s;e they could find that was portable, and brought the Booty on Board the Canoa.</P>
<P>This was very well for the fir&s;t Time, but this kind of Robbery did not plea&s;e &s;o well, they wan|ted to get out to Sea, but having no Ve&s;&s;el but their Canoa, they were prevented in their lauda|ble De&s;ign; however, they kept a good look out, and traver&s;ed the I&s;land, in Expectation that Pro|vidence would &s;end &s;ome unfortunate Ve&s;&s;el for a
<PB N="306" REF="315">
Sacrifice, and in a few Days their Wi&s;hes were ac|compli&s;hed; for at <HI>Duns Hole,</HI> they found a &s;mall Sloop at an Anchor, belonging to <HI>Bermudas:</HI> They made bold and went aboard, and <HI>Evans</HI> informed the Folks that belonged to her, that he was Cap|tain of the Ve&s;&s;el, which was a Piece of News they knew not before. After they had put their Affairs in a proper Di&s;po&s;ition aboard, they went a&s;hore to a little Village for Refre&s;hments, and lived jovialy the remaining Part of the Day, at a Tavern, &s;pending three Pi&s;toles, and then departed. The People of the Hou&s;e admired at the merry Gue&s;ts they had got, were mightily plea&s;ed, and wi&s;hed for their Company at another Time; which happened too &s;oon for their Profit; for in the middle of the Night, they came a&s;hore all Hands, rifled the Hou&s;e, and carried what they could aboard their Sloop.</P>
<P>The next Day they weighed in the Sloop, aboard of which they mounted four Guns, and called her the <HI>Scowerer,</HI> and &s;ailed to <HI>Hi&s;paniola;</HI> on the North Part of the I&s;land they took a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Sloop, which proved an extraordinary rich Prize, as it fell among &s;o few Per&s;ons as this Company con&s;i&s;ted of, for they &s;hared upwards of 150 <HI>l.</HI> a Man.</P>
<P>In Pur&s;uance of the Game, and beating up for the Windward I&s;lands, the <HI>Scowerer</HI> met with a Ship from <HI>New-England,</HI> bound to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> 120 Tuns, called the <HI>Dove,</HI> Captain <HI>Diamond,</HI> Ma&s;ter, off <HI>Porto Rico:</HI> They plundered her, and &s;trengthened their own Company, by taking out the Mate, and two or three other Men; they di&s;charged the Prize, and run into one of the I&s;lands, for fre&s;h Water and Ne|ce&s;&s;aries, and &s;taid there &s;ome Time.</P>
<P>The next Prize they made, was the <HI>Lucretia</HI> and <HI>Catherine,</HI> Captain <HI>Mills,</HI> of 200 Tun Burthen; they came up with her near the I&s;land <HI>Di&s;&s;cada, January</HI> 11th. Upon &s;eizing of this Ship, the Pyrates be|gan
<PB N="307" REF="316">
to take upon them&s;elves the Di&s;tribution of Ju&s;tice, examining the Men concerning their Ma|&s;ter's U&s;age of them, according to the Cu&s;tom of other Pyrates; but the Captain over-hearing the Matter, put an End to the Judicial Proceedings, and fell to rumaging the Ship, &s;aying to them, <HI>What have we to do to turn Reformers, 'tis Money we want?</HI> And &s;peaking to the Pri&s;oners, he asked them, <HI>Does your Captain give you Victuals enough?</HI> and they an&s;wer|ing in the Affirmitive: <HI>Why then,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>he ought to give you Work enough.</HI></P>
<P>After the taking of this Prize, they went to the little I&s;land of <HI>Avis,</HI> with a De&s;ign to clean, and carryed the <HI>Lucretia</HI> along with them, in order to heave down the <HI>Scowerer</HI> by her; but meeting there with a Sloop, the Pyrate gave Chace till the Eve|ning, when &s;he was within Gun-Shot of her; but fearing to lo&s;e Company with the <HI>Lucretia,</HI> who was a heavy Sailor, they left off, and &s;aw her no more. This Chace brought them to Leeward of their Port, &s;o that they were obliged to look out for another Place of Retreat, and the I&s;land of <HI>Ruby</HI> not being far di&s;tant, they &s;teered for that, and anchored there accordingly; but the next Day a <HI>Dutch</HI> Sloop coming as it were, into their Mouths, they could not forbear dealing, and &s;o making her their Prize, they plundered her of what came, when &s;hared, to fifty Pounds a Man.</P>
<P>They found this Sloop more for their Purpo&s;e than the <HI>Lucretia,</HI> to clean their own Sloop by, as being much lower in the Wa&s;t, and therefore capa|ble of heaving her bottom farther out of the Wa|ter, &s;o &s;he was di&s;charged, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Man kept in her Room; but not thinking it convenient to lay up here, for fear a Di&s;covery &s;hould be made, they turned their Thoughts another Way, and &s;teered to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> where they took a Sugar Drover, and then run to the <HI>Grand Camanoes,</HI>
<PB N="308" REF="317">
about 30 Leagues to Leeward of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> with In|tention to clean there; but an unhappy Accident put an End to their Pyracies, which hitherto had proved very &s;ucce&s;sful to them.</P>
<P>The Boat&s;wain of the Pyrate being a noi&s;y &s;urly Fellow, the Captain had &s;everal times Words with him, relating to his Behaviour, who thinking him&s;elf ill treated, not only returned ill Language, but al&s;o challenged the Captain to fight him on the next Shore they came to, with Pi&s;tols and Sword, as is the Cu&s;tom among the&s;e Outlaws. When the Sloop arrived, as above mentioned, the Captain propo&s;ed the Duel; but the cowardly Boat&s;wain re|fu&s;ed to fight, or go a&s;hore, tho' it was his own Challenge. When Captain <HI>Evans</HI> &s;aw there was no|thing to be done with him, he took his Cane, and gave him a hearty drubbing; but the Boat&s;wain not being able to bear &s;uch an Indignity, drew out a Pi&s;tol, and &s;hot <HI>Evans</HI> thro' the Head, &s;o that he fell down dead; and the Boat&s;wain immediately jumped over-board, and &s;wam towards the Shore; but the Boat was quickly mann'd and &s;ent after him, which took him up, and brought him aboard.</P>
<P>The Death of the Captain in that Manner, pro|voked all the Crew, and they re&s;olved the Crimi|nal &s;hould dye by the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Tortures; but while they were con&s;idering of the Puni&s;hment, the Gunner, with mo&s;t opprobrius Terms, fired with the utmo&s;t Indignation, and &s;hot him thro' the Body with a Pi&s;tol; but not killing him, the De|linquent, in very moving Words, de&s;ired a Week for Repentance only; but another &s;tepping up to him, told him, <HI>that he &s;hould repent and be damned to him,</HI> and without more ado &s;hot him dead.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have ob&s;erved, that when the <HI>Lucretia</HI> and <HI>Katherine</HI> was &s;uffered to go away, the Pyrates detained their Mate, who was now the only Man aboard, who under&s;tood Navigation, and him they
<PB N="309" REF="318">
de&s;ired to take upon him the Command of the Sloop, in the Room of Captain <HI>Evans</HI> decea&s;ed; but he de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed that Honour, and at length po&s;itively refu&s;ed it; &s;o they agreed to break up the Company, and leave the Mate in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Ve&s;&s;el: Accordingly they went a&s;hore at the <HI>Cam|manoes,</HI> carrying with them about nine thou&s;and Pounds, among thirty Per&s;ons; and it being fair Weather, the Mate and a Boy brought the Ve&s;&s;el into <HI>Port Royal,</HI> in <HI>Jamaica.</HI></P>

<P>I am come now to the End of my Account of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pyrates, having brought it home to the pre|&s;ent Time; for, to this Day, <HI>May</HI> the 9th, there has not been any Account come to <HI>England,</HI> of Pyracies committed, &s;ince the&s;e I have mentioned.

<P>A Brigantine belonging to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> one <HI>Mr. Row|ry</HI> Ma&s;ter, had been trading at <HI>Gambia,</HI> in <HI>Africa,</HI> and falling as low as Cape <HI>Mount,</HI> to fini&s;h the &s;laving of the Ve&s;&s;el, he had, by a Misfortune u&s;ual at that Part of the Coa&s;t, his Mate, Surgeon, and two more of his Men, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Term for &s;tealing of Men u&s;ed all over the Coa&s;t.</NOTE> <HI>Panyarr'd</HI> by the Ne|groes.

You will think it prodigious impudent that &s;o &s;mall a Number &s;hould undertake to proceed a pyrating, e&s;pecially when neither of them had &s;uf|ficient Skill in Navigation: Yet this they did, lea|ving tho&s;e People, their Ship-mates abovemention'd, to the Mercy of the barbarous Natives, and &s;ail'd away down the Coa&s;t, making them a black Flag, which they merrily &s;aid, would be as good as 50 Men more, <HI>i. e.</HI> would carry as much Terror; and that they did not doubt of &s;oon increa&s;ing their Crew, to put them in an enterpri&s;ing Capacity; but their vain Projection was &s;oon happily fru&s;tra|ted, and after this Manner.</P>
<P>The Ma&s;ter who&s;e Life they had pre&s;erved, (per|haps only for &s;upplying their own Unskillfulne&s;s in Navigation,) advi&s;ed them, that &s;ince contrary to their Expectations, they had met with no Ship between <HI>Ca$e Mount,</HI> and the <HI>Bite</HI> of <HI>Calabar,</HI> to pro|ceed to the I&s;land of St. <HI>Thomas</HI>'s, where they might recruit with Provi&s;ions and Water, and &s;ell off the Slaves (about 70 of them) which they perceived would be a u&s;ele&s;s Lumber, and incommodious to their De&s;ign. They arrived there in <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1721, and one Evening, while Part of them were on Shore, applying for this Purpo&s;e to the Governor, and the other Part carele&s;ly from the Deck, Mr. <HI>Rowry</HI> &s;tepped into the Beat belonging to the Ve&s;&s;el, and pu&s;hed off, very &s;uddenly: They heard the Noi&s;e it made, and &s;oon were upon Deck again, but ha|ving no other Boat to pur&s;ue, nor a Musket ready to fire, he got &s;afe on Shore, and ran to the Gover|nor with his Complaint, who immediately impri|&s;oned tho&s;e already there, and &s;ent a Launch off to take the re&s;t out of the Ship.</P>
<P>The <HI>Swallow</HI> arrived at St. <HI>Thomas</HI>'s the beginning of <HI>October</HI> following, where, on Mr. <HI>Rowry</HI>'s Remon|&s;trance, Application was made to the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Go|vernor of that I&s;land, for a Surrendery of the&s;e five

<HEAD>An Account of the Pyracies and Mur|ders committed by <HI>Philip Roche, &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>PHilip Roch</HI> was born in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and from his Youth had been bred up to the Sea; he was a brisk genteel Fellow, of 30 Years of Age at the time of his Death; one who&s;e black and &s;avage Nature did no ways an&s;wer the Comline&s;s of his Per&s;on, his Life being almo&s;t one continu'd Scene of Villany, be|fore he was di&s;cover'd to have committed the hor|rid Murthers we are now &s;peaking of.</P>
<P>This inhumane Mon&s;ter had been concern'd with others, in in&s;uring Ships to a great Value, and then de&s;troying them; by which Means, and other Rogueries, he had got a little Money; and being Mate of a Ship, was dilligent enough in trading for

him&s;elf between <HI>Ireland</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> &s;o that he was in a Way of getting him&s;elf a comfortable Liveli|hood: But, as he re&s;olved to be rich, and finding fair Dealing brought in Wealth but &s;lowly, he con|triv'd to put other Things in Execution, and cer|tainly had murthered &s;everal innocent Per&s;ons' in the Pro&s;ecution of his abominable Schemes; but as I have now forgot the particular Circum&s;tances of tho&s;e Relations, I &s;hall confine my &s;elf at pre&s;ent to the Fact for which he &s;uffer'd.</P>
<P><HI>Roch</HI> getting acquainted with one <HI>Neal,</HI> a Fi&s;her|man at <HI>Cork,</HI> whom he found ready for any villainous Attempt, he imparted his De&s;ign to him, who be|ing plea&s;ed with the Project, brings one <HI>Pierce Cullen</HI> and his Brother into the Confederacy, together with one <HI>Wi&s;e,</HI> who at fir&s;t was very unwilling to come into their Mea&s;ures, and, indeed, had the lea&s;t Hand in the Perpetration of what follows.</P>
<P>They pitch'd upon a Ve&s;&s;el in the Harbour, be|longing to <HI>Peter Tartoue,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Man, to execute their cruel Intentions upon, becau&s;e it was a &s;mall one, and had not a great Number of Hands on Board, and 'twas ea&s;y afterwards to exchange it for one more fit for Pyracy; and therefore they ap|ply'd them&s;elves to the Ma&s;ter of her, for a Pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Nantz,</HI> whereto the Ship was bound; and accor|dingly, the beginning of <HI>November</HI> 1721, they went aboard; and when at Sea, <HI>Philip Roche,</HI> being an expe|rienced Sailor, the Ma&s;ter of the Ve&s;&s;el readily tru&s;ted him with the Care of her, at times, while he and the Mate went to re&s;t.</P>
<P>The 15th of <HI>November,</HI> at Night, was the Time de&s;igned for the Tragedy; but <HI>Francis Wi&s;e</HI> relented, and appear'd de&s;irous to divert them from their bloody Purpo&s;es. <HI>Roche</HI> (&s;ometimes called Cap|tain) told him, <HI>That as</HI> Cullen <HI>and he had &s;u&s;tained great Lo&s;&s;es at Sea, unle&s;s every</HI> Iri&s;hman <HI>pre&s;ent would a&s;&s;i&s;t in repairing their Lo&s;&s;es, by murthering all the</HI> French

<HI>Rogues, and running away with the Ship, he &s;hould &s;uffer the &s;ame Fate with the</HI> Frenchmen; <HI>but if all would a&s;|&s;i&s;t, all &s;hould have a Share in the Booty.</HI> Upon this they all re&s;olved alike, and Captain <HI>Roch</HI> ordered three <HI>Frenchmen</HI> and a Boy up to Hand the Top&s;ails, the Ma&s;ter and Mate being then a&s;leep in their Ca|bins. The two fir&s;t that came down, they beat out their Brains, and threw them over-board: The other two &s;eeing what was done, ran up to the Top-ma&s;t Head, but <HI>Cullen</HI> follow'd them, and taking the Boy by the Arm, to&s;t him into the Sea; then dri|ving down the Man, tho&s;e below knock'd him on the Head, and threw him over-board.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who were a&s;leep being awakened by the di&s;mal Shrieks and Groans of dying Men, ran upon Deck in Confu&s;ion, to enquire into the Cau&s;e of &s;uch unu&s;ual Noi&s;es; but the &s;ame Cruelty was immediately acted towards them, e'er they could be &s;en&s;ible of the Danger that threat'ned them.</P>
<P>They were now (as <HI>Roche</HI> him&s;elf afterwards con|fe&s;s'd) <HI>all over as wet with the Blood that had been &s;pilt, as if they had been dip'd in Water, or &s;tood in a Shower of Rain; nor did they regard it any more. Roche</HI> &s;aid, Captain <HI>Tartoue</HI> u&s;ed many Words for Mercy, and ask'd them, if he had not u&s;ed them with Civility and Kindne&s;s? If they were not of the &s;ame Chri|&s;tian Religion, and own'd the &s;ame ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> and the like? But they, not regarding what he &s;aid, took Cords, and bound the poor Ma&s;ter and his Mate, Back to Back, and while that was doing, both of them begged with the utmo&s;t Earne&s;tne&s;s, and u&s;ed the mo&s;t &s;olemn Intreaties, that they would at lea&s;t allow them a few Minutes to &s;ay their Prayers, and beg Mercy of God for the various Sins and Of|fences of their Lives: But it did not move them, (though all the re&s;t were dead, and no Danger could be apprehended from them two alone) for the bound Per&s;ons were hurry'd up and thrown into the Sea.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="323">
The Ma&s;&s;acre being fini&s;h'd, they wa&s;h'd them|&s;elves a little from the Blood, and &s;earched the Che&s;ts and Lockers, and all Places about the Ship, and then &s;et down in the Captain's Cabin, and refre&s;hed them&s;elves with &s;ome Rum they found there, and (as <HI>Roche</HI> confe&s;&s;ed) were never merrier in their Lives. They inve&s;ted <HI>Roche</HI> with the Command of the Ship, and calling him Captain, talked over their Liquor, what rare Actions they would perform about Cape <HI>Briton, Sable I&s;le,</HI> and the <HI>Banks</HI> of <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> whither they de&s;ign|ed to go as &s;oon as they had recruited their Company, and got a better Ship, which they pro|po&s;ed &s;peedily to do.</P>
<P><HI>Roche</HI> taking upon him&s;elf the Command of the Ve&s;&s;el, <HI>Andrew Callen</HI> was to pa&s;s for a Merchant, or Super-cargo; but then they bethought them&s;elves, that they were in Danger of being di&s;covered by the Papers in the Ship, relating to the Cargo, as Bills of Lading, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> therefore they era&s;e and take out the Name of the <HI>French</HI> Ma&s;ter, and in&s;tead thereof, in&s;erted the Name of <HI>Roche,</HI> &s;o that it &s;tood in the Ship's Papers, <HI>Peter Roche,</HI> Ma&s;ter; that then having &s;o few Hands on Board, they contri|ved if they met any Ships, to give out, that they had lo&s;t &s;ome Hands by their being wa&s;h'd over|board in a Storm, and by that means &s;creen them|&s;elves from being &s;u&s;pected of having committed &s;ome &s;uch wicked Act, by rea&s;on of the fewne&s;s of their Hands on board; and al&s;o might prevail with &s;ome Ship to &s;pare them &s;ome, on Con&s;ideration of their pretended Di&s;a&s;ter.</P>
<P>In going to <HI>Cales</HI> they were in Di&s;tre&s;s by the Weather, and being near <HI>Lisbon,</HI> they made Com|plaint to a Ship, but obtain'd no A&s;&s;i&s;tance. They were then obliged to &s;ail back for <HI>England,</HI> and put into the Port of <HI>Dartmouth;</HI> but then they were in Fear le&s;t they might be di&s;covered, therefore to pre|vent

that, they re&s;olve to alter the Ship, and getting Workmen, they take down the Mizen-ma&s;t, and build a Spar Deck, and made Rails, (on pretence that the Sailors had been wa&s;h'd overboard) to &s;e|cure the Men. Then they took down the Image of St <HI>Peter</HI> at the Head of the Ship, and put up a Lion in its Place, and painted over the Stern of the Ship with Red, and new nam'd her, the <HI>May</HI> Snow. The Ship being thus alter'd that they thought it could not be known, they fancy'd them&s;elves pretty &s;e|cure; but wanting Money to defray the Charge of the&s;e Alterations, <HI>Roche,</HI> as Ma&s;ter of the Ve&s;&s;el, and <HI>Andrew Cullen,</HI> as Merchant, apply them&s;elves to the Officers of the Cu&s;toms for Liberty to di&s;po&s;e of &s;ome of the Cargo, in order to pay the Work|men; which they having obtained, they &s;old fifty eight Barrels of Beef, and having hired three more Hands, they &s;et Sail for <HI>O&s;tend,</HI> and there having &s;old more Barrels of Beef, they &s;teer their Cour&s;e to <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> di&s;po&s;e of the re&s;t of the Cargoe, and took in one Mr. <HI>Anne&s;ley,</HI> who freighted the Ship for <HI>England;</HI> but in their Pa&s;&s;age, in a &s;tormy Night, it being very dark, they took up Mr. <HI>Anne&s;ly</HI> their Pa&s;&s;enger, and threw him into the Sea, who &s;wam about the Ship a pretty while, calling out for Life, and telling them, they &s;hould have all his Goods, if they would receive him again into the Ve&s;&s;el: But in vain were his Cries!</P>
<P>After this, they were obliged to put into &s;eve|ral Ports, and by contrary Winds, came to the Coa&s;t of <HI>France,</HI> and hearing there was an Enqui|ry made after the Ship, <HI>Roche</HI> quits her at <HI>Havre de Grace,</HI> and leaves the Management to <HI>Cullen</HI> and the re&s;t; who having &s;hipp'd other Men, &s;aill'd away to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and there quitted the Ve&s;&s;el, which was afterwards &s;eized and brought into the River of <HI>Thames.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>An ABSTRACT of the Civil Law and Statute Law now in Force, in Rela|tion to</HI> PYRACY.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_APyrate is</HI> Ho&s;tis humanis generis, <HI>a common Enemy, with whom neither Faith nor Oath is to be kept, according to</HI> Tully. <HI>And by the Laws of Nature, Princes and States are re|&s;pon&s;ible for their Neglect, if they do not provide Reme|dies for re&s;training the&s;e &s;ort of Robberies. Though Py|rates are called common Enemies, yet they are properly not to be term'd &s;o. He is only to be honoured with that Name, &s;ays</HI> Cicero, <HI>who hath a Commonwealth, a Court, a Trea|&s;ury, Con&s;ent and Concord of Citizens, and &s;ome Way, if Occa&s;ion be, of Peace and League: But when they have reduced them&s;elves into a Government or State, as tho&s;e of</HI> Algier, Sally, Tripoli, Tunis, <HI>and the like, they then are allowed the Solemnities of War, and the Rights of Le|gation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If Letters of</HI> Marque <HI>be granted to a Merchant, and he furni&s;hes out a Ship, with a Captain and Mariners, and they, in&s;tead of taking the Goods, or Ships, of that Nation again&s;t whom their Commi&s;&s;ion is awarded, take the Ship and Goods of a Friend, this is Pyracy; and if the Ship arrive in any Part of his Maje&s;ty's Dominions, it will be &s;eized, and for ever lo&s;t to the Owners; but they are no way liable to make Satisfaction.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If a Ship is a&s;&s;aulted and taken by the Pyrates, for Re|demption of which, the Ma&s;ter becomes a Slave to the Cap|tors, by the Law</HI> Marine, <HI>the Ship and Lading are tacitly obliged for his Redemption, by a general Contribution; but if</HI>

<P><HI>If Pyracy is committed by Subjects in Enmity with</HI> Eng|land, <HI>upon the</HI> Briti&s;h <HI>Seas, it is properly, only puni&s;hable by the Crown of</HI> England, <HI>who have</HI> i&s;tud regimen &amp; Dominium <HI>exclu&s;ive of all other Power.</HI></P>

<P><HI>If Merchandize be delivered to a Ma&s;ter, to carry to one Port, and he carries it to another, and &s;ells and di&s;po&s;es of it, this is not Felony; but if, after unlading it at the fir&s;t Port, he retakes it, it is Pyracy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If a Pyrate attack a Ship, and the Ma&s;ter for Redemption, gives his Oath to pay a Sum of Money, tho' there be nothing taken, yet it is Pyracy by the Law</HI> Marine.</P>
<P><HI>If a Ship is riding at Anchor, and the Mariners all a&s;hore, and a Pyrate attack her, and rob her, this is Pyracy.</HI></P>
