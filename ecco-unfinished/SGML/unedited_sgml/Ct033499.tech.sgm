<P>THE much lamented Author of the&s;e E&s;&s;ays
left them in the hands of his friends to be di&s;|po&s;ed
of as they thought proper, having immedi|ately
before his death de&s;troyed many other manu|&s;cripts
which he thought unfit for being made pub|lic.
When the&s;e were in&s;pected, the greater num|ber
of them appeared to be parts of a plan he once
had formed, for giving a connected hi&s;tory of the li|beral
&s;ciences and elegant arts. It is long &s;ince he
found it nece&s;&s;ary to abandon that plan as far too ex|ten&s;ive;
and the&s;e parts of it lay be&s;ide him neglected
until his death. His friends are per&s;uaded however,
that the reader will find in them that happy connec|tion,
that full and accurate expre&s;&s;ion, and that clear
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
illu&s;tration which are con&s;picuous in the re&s;t of his
works; and that though it is difficult to add much to
the great fame he &s;o ju&s;tly acquired by his other
writings, the&s;e will be read with &s;atisfaction and
plea&s;ure.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">From Mr. SMITH's Birth till the Publication of the Theory of
Moral Sentiments.</HEAD>
<P>ADAM SMITH, Author of the Inquiry into the Nature
and Cau&s;es of the Wealth of Nations, was the &s;on of
ADAM SMITH, Comptroller of the Cu&s;toms at Kirkaldy<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Mr. SMITH, the father, was a native of Aberdeen&s;hire, and in the earlier part of his life practi&s;ed at Edinburgh as a writer to the Signet. He was afterwards pri|vate &s;ecretary to the Earl of Loudoun, (during the time that he held the offices of principal Secretary of State for Scotland, and of Keeper of the Great Seal,) and con|tinued in this &s;ituation till 1713 or 1714, when he was appointed comptroller of the cu&s;toms at Kirkaldy. He was al&s;o clerk to the courts martial and councils of war for Scotland; an office which he held from 1707 till his death. As it is now &s;eventy years &s;ince he died, the accounts I have received of him are very imperfect; but from the particulars already mentioned, it may be pre&s;umed, that he was a man of more than common abilities.</NOTE>, and
of MARGARET DOUGLAS, daughter, of Mr. DOUGLAS of Stra|thenry.
He was the only child of the marriage, and was born at
Kirkaldy on the 5th of June 1723, a few months after the death of
his father.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="9">
His con&s;titution during infancy was infirm and &s;ickly, and
required all the tender &s;olicitude of his &s;urviving parent. She was
blamed for treating him with an unlimited indulgence; but it
produced no unfavourable effects on his temper or his di&s;po&s;itions:&mdash;and
he enjoyed the rare &s;atisfaction of being able to repay her
affection, by every attention that &s;ilial gratitude could dictate, during
the long period of &s;ixty years.</P>
<P>An accident which happened to him when he was about three
years old, is of too intere&s;ting a nature to be omitted in the account
of &s;o valuable a life. He had been carried by his mother to Stra|thenry
on a vi&s;it to his uncle Mr. DOUGLAS, and was one day
amu&s;ing him&s;elf alone at the door of the hou&s;e when he was &s;tolen
by a party of that &s;et of vagrants who are known in Scotland by
the name of tinkers. Luckily he was &s;oon mi&s;&s;ed by his uncle,
who hearing that &s;ome vagrants had pa&s;&s;ed, pur&s;ued them, with what
a&s;&s;i&s;tance he could find, till he overtook them in Le&s;lie wood;
and was the happy in&s;trument of pre&s;erving to the world a
genius, which was de&s;tined, not only to extend the boun|daries
of &s;cience, but to enlighten and reform the commercial policy
of Europe.</P>
<P>The &s;chool of Kirkaldy, where Mr. SMITH received the fir&s;t ru|diments
of his education, was then taught by Mr. DAVID MILLER,
a teacher, in his day, of con&s;iderable reputation, and who&s;e name
de&s;erves to be recorded, on account of the eminent men whom
that very ob&s;cure &s;eminary produced while under his direction.
Of this number were Mr. OSWALD of Dunikeir; his brother, Dr.
JOHN OSWALD, afterwards Bi&s;hop of Raphoe; and our late excel|lent
colleague, the Reverend Dr. JOHN DRYSDALE: all of them
nearly contemporary with Mr. SMITH, and united with him through
life by the clo&s;e&s;t ties of friend&s;hip.&mdash;One of his &s;chool-fellows is &s;till
<PB N="xi" REF="10">
alive<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">GEORGE DRYSDALE, E&s;q. of Kirkaldy, brother of the late Dr. DRYSDALE.</NOTE>; and to his kindne&s;s I am principally indebted for the
&s;canty materials which form the fir&s;t part of this narrative.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e companions of his earlie&s;t years, Mr. SMITH
&s;oon attracted notice, by his pa&s;&s;ion for books, and by the ex|traordinary
powers of his memory. The weakne&s;s of his bo|dily
con&s;titution prevented him from partaking in their more
active amu&s;ements; but he was much beloved by them on ac|count
of his temper, which, though warm, was to an uncom|mon
degree friendly and generous. Even then he was re|markable
for tho&s;e habits which remained with him through
life, of &s;peaking to him&s;elf when alone, and of <HI>ab&s;ence</HI> in com|pany.</P>
<P>From
the grammar-&s;chool of Kirkaldy, he was &s;ent, in 1737, to
the Univer&s;ity of Gla&s;gow, where he remained till 1740, when
he went to Balliol College, Oxford, as an exhibitioner on SNELL's
foundation.</P>
<P>Dr. MACLAINE of the Hague, who was a fellow-&s;tudent of Mr.
SMITH's at Gla&s;gow, told me &s;ome years ago, that his favourite
pur&s;uits while at that Univer&s;ity were Mathematics and Natural
Philo&s;ophy; and I remember to have heard my father remind him
of a geometrical problem of con&s;iderable difficulty, about which he
was occupied at the time when their acquaintance commenced,
and which had been propo&s;ed to him as an exerci&s;e&punc; by the cele|brated
Dr. SIMPSON.</P>
<P>The&s;e, however, were certainly not the &s;ciences in which
he was formed to excel; nor did they long divert him from
<PB N="xii" REF="11">
pur&s;uits more congenial to his mind. What Lord BACON &s;ays
of PLATO may be ju&s;tly applied to him: &startq;Illum, licet ad rem|publicam
non acce&s;&s;i&s;&s;et, tamen natur&acirc; et inclinatione omnino
ad res civiles propen&s;um, vires eo praecipue intendi&s;&s;e; neque
de Philo&s;ophia Naturali admodum &s;ollicitum e&s;&s;e; ni&s;i quatenus
ad Philo&s;ophi nomen et celebritatem tuendam, et ad maje&s;|tatem
quandam moralibus et civilibus doctrinis addendam et
a&s;pergendam &s;ufficeret<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Redargutio Philo&s;ophiarum.</NOTE>.&endq; The &s;tudy of human nature in all
its branches, more particularly of the political hi&s;tory of mankind,
opened a boundle&s;s field to his curio&s;ity and ambition; and while it
afforded &s;cope to all the various powers of his ver&s;atile and compre|hen&s;ive
genius, gratified his ruling pa&s;&s;ion, of contributing to the
happine&s;s and the improvement of &s;ociety. To this &s;tudy, diver|&s;ified
at his lei&s;ure hours by the le&s;s &s;evere occupations of polite li|terature,
he &s;eems to have devoted him&s;elf almo&s;t entirely from
the time of his removal to Oxford; but he &s;till retained, and
retained even in advanced years, a recollection of his early acqui&s;i|tions,
which not only added to the &s;plendour of his conver&s;ation,
but enabled him to exemplify &s;ome of his favourite theories con|cerning
the natural progre&s;s of the mind in the inve&s;tigation of truth,
by the hi&s;tory of tho&s;e &s;ciences in which the connection and &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
of di&s;coveries may be traced with the greate&s;t advantage.
If I am not mi&s;taken too, the influence of his early ta&s;te for the
Greek geometry may be remarked in the elementary clearne&s;s and
fulne&s;s, bordering &s;ometimes upon prolixity, with which he fre|quently
&s;tates his political rea&s;onings.&mdash;The lectures of the pro|found
and eloquent Dr. HUTCHESON, which he had attended
previous to his departure from Gla&s;gow, and of which he always
&s;poke in terms of the warme&s;t admiration, had, it may be rea&s;on|ably
<PB N="xiii" REF="12">
pre&s;umed, a con&s;iderable effect in directing his talents to their
proper objects.</P>
<P>I have not been able to collect any information with re&s;pect
to that part of his youth which was &s;pent in England. I
have heard him &s;ay, that he employed him&s;elf frequently in the
practice of tran&s;lation, (particularly from the French,) with a
view to the improvement of his own &s;tyle: and he u&s;ed often to
expre&s;s a favourable opinion of the utility of &s;uch exerci&s;es, to all
who cultivate the art of compo&s;ition. It is much to be regretted,
that none of his juvenile attempts in this way have been pre&s;erved;
as the few &s;pecimens which his writings contain of his &s;kill as a
tran&s;lator, are &s;ufficient to &s;hew the eminence he had attained in a
walk of literature, which, in our country, has been &s;o little fre|quented
by men of genius.</P>
<P>It was probably al&s;o at this period of his life, that he cultivated
with the greate&s;t care the &s;tudy of languages. The knowledge
he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the&s;e, both ancient and modern, was uncommon|ly
exten&s;ive and accurate; and, in him, was &s;ub&s;ervient, not to a
vain parade of ta&s;tele&s;s erudition, but to a familiar acquaintance with
every thing that could illu&s;trate the in&s;titutions, the manners, and the
ideas of different ages and nations. How intimately he had once
been conver&s;ant with the more ornamental branches of learning; in
particular, with the works of the Roman, Greek, French, and Italian
poets, appeared &s;ufficiently from the hold which they kept of his me|mory,
after all the different occupations and enquiries in which
his maturer faculties had been employed<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The uncommon degree in which Mr. SMITH retained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, even to the clo&s;e of his life, of different branches of knowledge which he had long cea&s;ed to culti|vate, has been often remarked to me by my learned colleague and friend, Mr. DALZEL, Profe&s;&s;or of Greek in this Univer&s;ity.&mdash;Mr. DALZEL mentioned particularly the readine&s;s and correctne&s;s of Mr. SMITH's memory on philological &s;ubjects, and the acutene&s;s and &s;kill he di&s;played in various conver&s;ations with him on &s;ome of the <HI>minutiae</HI> of Greek grammar.</NOTE>. In the Engli&s;h lan|guage,
<PB N="xiv" REF="13">
the variety of poetical pa&s;&s;ages which he was not only
accu&s;tomed to refer to occa&s;ionally, but which he was able to repeat
with correctne&s;s, appeared &s;urpri&s;ing even to tho&s;e, who&s;e attention
had never been directed to more important acqui&s;itions.</P>
<P>After a re&s;idence at Oxford of &s;even years, he returned to
Kirkaldy, and lived two years with his mother; engaged in
&s;tudy, but without any fixed plan for his future life. He had
been originally de&s;tined for the Church of England, and with
that view had been &s;ent to Oxford; but not finding the eccle|&s;ia&s;tical
profe&s;&s;ion &s;uitable to his ta&s;te, he cho&s;e to con&s;ult, in
this in&s;tance, his own inclination, in preference to the wi&s;hes of
his friends; and abandoning at once all the &s;chemes which
their prudence had formed for him, he re&s;olved to return to his
own country, and to limit his ambition to the uncertain pro&s;pect of
obtaining, in time, &s;ome one of tho&s;e moderate preferments, to
which literary attainments lead in Scotland.</P>
<P>In the year 1748, he fixed his re&s;idence at Edinburgh, and during
that and the following years, read lectures on rhetoric and belles
lettres, under the patronage of Lord KAMES. About this time, too,
he contracted a very intimate friend&s;hip, which continued without
interruption till his death, with Mr. ALEXANDER WEDDERBURN,
now Lord LOUGHBOROUGH, and with Mr. WILLIAM JOHNSTONE,
now Mr. PULTENEY.</P>
<P>At what particular period his acquaintance with Mr. DAVID
HUME commenced, does not appear from any information that
<PB N="xv" REF="14">
I have received; but from &s;ome papers, now in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
Mr. HUME's nephew, and which he has been &s;o obliging as to allow
me to peru&s;e, their acquaintance &s;eems to have grown into friend|&s;hip
before the year 1752. It was a friend&s;hip on both &s;ides
founded on the admiration of genius, and the love of &s;implicity;
and which forms an intere&s;ting circum&s;tance in the hi&s;tory of each
of the&s;e eminent men, from the ambition which both have &s;hewn
to record it to po&s;terity.</P>
<P>In 1751, he was elected Profe&s;&s;or of Logic in the Univer&s;ity
of Gla&s;gow; and, the year following, he was removed to the Pro|fe&s;&s;or&s;hip
of Moral Philo&s;ophy in the &s;ame Univer&s;ity, upon the death
of Mr. THOMAS CRAIGIE, the immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Dr. HUT|CHESON.
In this &s;ituation, he remained thirteen years; a period he
u&s;ed frequently to look back to, as the mo&s;t u&s;eful and happy of his
life. It was indeed a &s;ituation in which he was eminently fitted to
excel, and in which the daily labours of his profe&s;&s;ion were con|&s;tantly
recalling his attention to his favourite pur&s;uits, and familiari|&s;ing
his mind to tho&s;e important &s;peculations he was afterwards to
communicate to the world. In this view, though it afforded, in the
mean time, but a very narrow &s;cene for his ambition, it was pro|bably
in&s;trumental, in no incon&s;iderable degree, to the future emi|nence
of his literary character.</P>
<P>Of Mr. SMITH's lectures while a Profe&s;&s;or at Gla&s;gow, no part
has been pre&s;erved, excepting what he him&s;elf publi&s;hed in the
Theory of Moral Sentiments and in the Wealth of Nations. The
Society therefore, I am per&s;uaded, will li&s;ten with plea&s;ure to the
following &s;hort account of them, for which I am indebted to a
gentleman who was formerly one of Mr. SMITH's pupils, and who
<PB N="xvi" REF="15">
continued till his death to be one of his mo&s;t intimate and valued
friends.</P>
<P>&startq;In the Profe&s;&s;or&s;hip of Logic, to which Mr. SMITH was ap|pointed
on his fir&s;t introduction into this Univer&s;ity, he &s;oon &s;aw
the nece&s;&s;ity of departing widely from the plan that had been fol|lowed
by his predece&s;&s;ors, and of directing the attention of his
pupils to &s;tudies of a more intere&s;ting and u&s;eful nature than the
logic and metaphy&s;ics of the &s;chools. Accordingly, after exhibiting
a general view of the powers of the mind, and explaining &s;o much
of the ancient logic as was requi&s;ite to gratify curio&s;ity with re|&s;pect
to an artificial method of rea&s;oning, which had once occupied
the univer&s;al attention of the learned, he dedicated all the re&s;t of
his time to the delivery of a &s;y&s;tem of rhetoric and belles lettres.
The be&s;t method of explaining and illu&s;trating the various powers
of the human mind, the mo&s;t u&s;eful part of metaphy&s;ics, ari&s;es from
an examination of the &s;everal ways of communicating our thoughts
by &s;peech, and from an attention to the principles of tho&s;e literary
compo&s;itions which contribute to per&s;ua&s;ion or entertainment. By
the&s;e arts, every thing that we perceive or feel, every operation of
our minds, is expre&s;&s;ed and delineated in &s;uch a manner, that it may
be clearly di&s;tingui&s;hed and remembered. There is, at the &s;ame
time, no branch of literature more &s;uited to youth at their fir&s;t en|trance
upon philo&s;ophy than this, which lays hold of their ta&s;te and
their feelings.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It is much to be regretted, that the manu&s;cript containing
Mr. SMITH's lectures on this &s;ubject was de&s;troyed before his death.
The fir&s;t part, in point of compo&s;ition, was highly fini&s;hed; and
the whole di&s;covered &s;trong marks of ta&s;te and original genius.
<PB N="xvii" REF="16">
From the permi&s;&s;ion given to &s;tudents of taking notes, many ob&s;er|vations
and opinions contained in the&s;e lectures have either been
detailed in &s;eparate di&s;&s;ertations, or ingro&s;&s;ed in general collections,
which have &s;ince been given to the public. But the&s;e, as might be
expected, have lo&s;t the air of originality and the di&s;tinctive cha|racter
which they received from their fir&s;t author, and are often ob|&s;cured
by that multiplicity of common-place matter in which they
are &s;unk and involved.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;About a year after his appointment to the Profe&s;&s;or&s;hip of
Logic, Mr. SMITH was elected to the chair of Moral Philo&s;ophy.
His cour&s;e of lectures on this &s;ubject was divided into four parts.
The fir&s;t contained Natural Theology; in which he con&s;idered the
proofs of the being and attributes of GOD, and tho&s;e principles of
the human mind upon which religion is founded. The &s;econd com|prehended
Ethics &s;trictly &s;o called, and con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of the doc|trines
which he afterwards publi&s;hed in his Theory of Moral Senti|ments.
In the third part, he treated at more length of that branch
of morality which relates to <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> and which, being &s;u&s;ceptible of
preci&s;e and accurate rules, is for that rea&s;on capable of a full and
particular explanation.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Upon this &s;ubjet he followed the plan that &s;eems to be &s;ug|ge&s;ted
by MONTESQUIEU; endeavouring to trace the gradual pro|gre&s;s
of juri&s;prudence, both public and private, from the rude&s;t to
the mo&s;t refined ages, and to point out the effects of tho&s;e arts which
contribute to &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and to the accumulation of property, in
producing corre&s;pondent improvements or alterations in law and go|vernment.
This important branch of his labours he al&s;o intended
to give to the public; but this intention, which is mentioned in
the conclu&s;ion of the Theory of Moral Sentiments, he did not live
to fulfil.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="xviii" REF="17">
&startq;In the la&s;t part of his lectures, he examined tho&s;e political
regulations which are founded, not upon the principle of <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI>
but that of <HI>expediency,</HI> and which are calculated to increa&s;e the
riches, the power, and the pro&s;perity of a State. Under this view, he
con&s;idered the political in&s;titutions relating to commerce, to finances,
to eccle&s;ia&s;tical and military e&s;tabli&s;hments. What he delivered
on the&s;e &s;ubjects contained the &s;ub&s;tance of the work he afterwards
publi&s;hed under the title of An Inquiry into the Nature and Cau&s;es
of the Wealth of Nations.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;There was no &s;ituation in which the abilities of Mr. SMITH
appeared to greater advantage than as a Profe&s;&s;or. In delivering his
lectures, he tru&s;ted almo&s;t entirely to extemporary elocution. His
manner, though not graceful, was plain and unaffected; and as he
&s;eemed to be always intere&s;ted in the &s;ubject, he never failed to in|tere&s;t
his hearers. Each di&s;cour&s;e con&s;i&s;ted commonly of &s;everal di&s;|tinct
propo&s;itions, which he &s;ucce&s;&s;ively endeavoured to prove and
illu&s;trate. The&s;e propo&s;itions, when announced in general terms,
had, from their extent, not unfrequently &s;omething of the air of a
paradox. In his attempts to explain them, he often appeared, at
fir&s;t, not to be &s;ufficiently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;ubject, and &s;poke with
&s;ome he&s;itation. As he advanced, however, the matter &s;eemed to
crowd upon him, his manner became warm and animated, and his
expre&s;&s;ion ea&s;y and fluent. In points &s;u&s;ceptible of controver&s;y, you
could ea&s;ily di&s;cern, that he &s;ecretly conceived an oppo&s;ition to his
opinions, and that he was led upon this account to &s;upport them
with greater energy and vehemence. By the fulne&s;s and variety of
his illu&s;trations, the &s;ubject gradually &s;welled in his hands, and ac|quired
a dimen&s;ion which, without a tedious repetition of the &s;ame
views, was calculated to &s;eize the attention of his audience, and to
afford them plea&s;ure, as well as in&s;truction, in following the &s;ame
<PB N="xix" REF="18">
object, through all the diver&s;ity of &s;hades and a&s;pects in which it
was pre&s;ented, and afterwards in tracing it backwards to that ori|ginal
propo&s;ition or general truth, from which this beautiful train
of &s;peculation had proceeded.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;His reputation as a Profe&s;&s;or was accordingly rai&s;ed very high,
and a multitude of &s;tudents from a great di&s;tance re&s;orted to the
Univer&s;ity, merely upon his account. Tho&s;e branches of &s;cience
which he taught became fa&s;hionable at this place, and his opinions
were the chief topics of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion in clubs and literary &s;ocieties.
Even the &s;mall peculiarities in his pronunciation or manner of
&s;peaking, became frequently the objects of imitation.&endq;</P>
<P>While Mr. Smith was thus di&s;tingui&s;hing him&s;elf by his zeal
and ability as a public teacher, he was gradually laying the found|ation
of a more exten&s;ive reputation, by preparing for the pre&s;s
his &s;y&s;tem of morals. The fir&s;t edition of this work appeared in
1759, under the title of &startq;The Theory of Moral Sentiments.&endq;</P>
<P>Hitherto Mr. Smith had remained unknown to the world as an
author; nor have I heard that he had made a trial of his powers
in any anonymous publications, excepting in a periodical work
called <HI>The Edinburgh Review,</HI> which was begun in the year 1755,
by &s;ome gentlemen of di&s;tingui&s;ed abilities, but which they were
prevented by other engagements from carrying farther than the
two fir&s;t numbers. To this work Mr. SMITH contributed a re|view
of Dr. JOHNSON's Dictionary of the Engli&s;h Language, and
al&s;o a letter, addre&s;&s;ed to the editors, containing &s;ome general ob|&s;ervations
on the &s;tate of literature in the different countries of
Europe. In the former of the&s;e papers, he points out &s;ome de|fects
in Dr. JOHNSON's plan, which he cen&s;ures as not &s;ufficiently
<PB N="xx" REF="19">
grammatical. &startq;The different &s;ignifications of a word (he ob&s;erves)
are indeed collected; but they are &s;eldom dige&s;ted into general
cla&s;&s;es, or ranged under the meaning which the word principally
expre&s;&s;es: And &s;ufficient care is not taken to di&s;tingui&s;h the
words apparently &s;ynonymous.&endq; To illu&s;trate this critici&s;m, he
copies from Dr. JOHNSON the articles BUT and HUMOUR, and
oppo&s;es to them the &s;ame articles dige&s;ted agreeably to his own idea.
The various &s;ignifications of the word BUT are very nicely and hap|pily
di&s;criminated. The other article does not &s;eem to have been
executed with equal care.</P>
<P>The ob&s;ervations on the &s;tate of learning in Europe are written
with ingenuity and elegance; but are chiefly intere&s;ting, as they
&s;hew the attention which the Author had given to the philo&s;ophy
and literature of the Continent, at a period when they were not
much &s;tudied in this i&s;land.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame volume with the Theory of Moral Sentiments,
Mr. SMITH publi&s;hed a Di&s;&s;ertation &startq;on the Origin of Languages,
and on the different Genius of tho&s;e which are original and com|pounded.&endq;
The remarks I have to offer on the&s;e two di&s;cour&s;es,

<HEAD>SECTION II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Theory of Moral Sentiments, and the Di&s;&s;ertation on the
Origin of Languages.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;cience of Ethics has been divided by modern writers into
two parts; the one comprehending the theory of Morals,
and the other its practical doctrines. The que&s;tions about which
the former is employed, are chiefly the two following. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> By
what principle of our con&s;titution are we led to form the notion of
moral di&s;tinctions;&mdash;whether by that faculty which perceives the di&s;|tinction
between truth and fal&s;ehood; or by a peculiar power of per|ception,
which is <HI>plea&s;ed</HI> with one &s;et of qualities, and <HI>di&s;plea&s;ed</HI>
with another? <HI>Secondly,</HI> What is the proper object of moral appro|bation;
or, in other words, What is the common quality or quali|ties
belonging to all the different modes of virtue? Is it benevo|lence;
or a rational &s;elf-love; or a di&s;po&s;ition to act &s;uitably to the
different relations in which we are placed? The&s;e two que&s;tions &s;eem
to exhau&s;t the whole theory of Morals. The &s;cope of the one is to a&s;|certain
the origin of our moral ideas; that of the other, to refer the
phenomena of moral perception to their mo&s;t &s;imple and general laws.</P>
<P>The practical doctrines of morality comprehend all tho&s;e rules
of conduct which profe&s;s to point out the proper ends of human
pur&s;uit, and the mo&s;t effectual means of attaining them; to which
we may add all tho&s;e literary compo&s;itions, whatever be their par|ticular
form, which have for their aim to fortify and animate our
good di&s;po&s;itions, by delineations of the beauty, of the dignity, or
of the utility of Virtue.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not enquire at pre&s;ent into the ju&s;tne&s;s of this divi&s;ion.
I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that the words&punc; Theory and Practice are not,
<PB N="xxii" REF="21">
in this in&s;tance, employed in their u&s;ual acceptations. The theory
of Morals does not bear, for example, the &s;ame relation to the prac|tice
of Morals, that the theory of geometry bears to practical geo|metry.
In this la&s;t &s;cience, all the practical rules are founded on
theoretical principles previou&s;ly e&s;tabli&s;hed: But in the former &s;cience,
the practical rules are obvious to the capacities of all mankind; the
theoretical principles form one of the mo&s;t difficult &s;ubjects of di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion
that have ever exerci&s;ed the ingenuity of metaphy&s;icians.</P>
<P>In illu&s;trating the doctrines of practical morality, (if we make
allowance for &s;ome unfortunate prejudices produced or encouraged
by violent and oppre&s;&s;ive &s;y&s;tems of policy,) the antients &s;eem to
have availed them&s;elves of every light furni&s;hed by nature to hu|man
rea&s;on; and indeed tho&s;e writers who, in later times, have
treated the &s;ubject with the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s, are they who have
followed mo&s;t clo&s;ely the foot&s;teps of the Greek and the Roman
philo&s;ophers. The theoretical que&s;tion, too, concerning the e&s;&s;ence
of virtue, or the proper <HI>object</HI> of moral approbation, was a favourite
topic of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion in the ancient &s;chools. The que&s;tion concerning
the <HI>principle</HI> of moral approbation, though not entirely of modern
origin, has been chiefly agitated &s;ince the writings of Dr. CUD|WORTH,
in oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e of Mr. HOBBES; and it is this
que&s;tion accordingly, (recommended, at once, by its novelty and
difficulty to the curio&s;ity of &s;peculative men,) that has produced
mo&s;t of the theories which characteri&s;e and di&s;tingui&s;h from each
other the later &s;y&s;tems of moral philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>It was the opinion of Dr. CUDWORTH, and al&s;o of Dr. CLARKE,
that moral di&s;tinctions are perceived by that power of the mind
which di&s;tingui&s;hes truth from fal&s;ehood. This &s;y&s;tem it was one
great object of Dr. HUTCHESON'S philo&s;ophy to refute, and in op|po&s;ition
to it, to &s;hew that the words Right and Wrong expre&s;s
<PB N="xxiii" REF="22">
certain agreeable and di&s;agreeable qualities in actions, which it is
not the province of rea&s;on but of feeling to perceive; and to that
power of perception which renders us &s;u&s;ceptible of plea&s;ure or of
pain from the view of virtue or of vice, he gave the name of the
Moral Sen&s;e. His rea&s;onings upon this &s;ubject are in the main ac|quie&s;ced
in, both by Mr. HUME and Mr. SMITH; but they differ
from him in one important particular,&mdash;Dr. HUTCHESON plainly
&s;uppo&s;ing, that the moral &s;en&s;e is a &s;imple principle of our con&s;titu|tion,
of which no account can be given; whereas the other two
philo&s;ophers have both attempted to analy&s;e it into other principles
more general. Their &s;y&s;tems, however, with re&s;pect to it are very
different from each other. According to Mr. HUME, all the
qualities which are denominated virtuous, are u&s;eful either to our|&s;elves
or to others, and the plea&s;ure which we derive from the view
of them is the plea&s;ure of utility. Mr. SMITH, without rejecting
entirely Mr. HUME'S doctrine, propo&s;es another of his own, far
more comprehen&s;ive; a doctrine with which he thinks all the
mo&s;t celebrated theories of morality invented by his predece&s;&s;ors
coincide in part, and from &s;ome partial view of which he appre|hends
that they have all proceeded.</P>
<P>Of this very ingenious and original theory, I &s;hall endeavour to
give a &s;hort ab&s;tract. To tho&s;e who are familiarly acquainted with
it as it is &s;tated by its author, I am aware that the attempt may ap|pear
&s;uperfluous; but I flatter my&s;elf that it will not be wholly u&s;e|le&s;s
to &s;uch as have not been much conver&s;ant in the&s;e ab&s;tract
di&s;qui&s;itions, by pre&s;enting to them the leading principles of the
&s;y&s;tem in one connected view, without tho&s;e interruptions of the
attention which nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;e from the author's various and happy
illu&s;trations, and from the many eloquent digre&s;&s;ions which animate
and adorn his compo&s;ition.</P>
<P><PB N="xxiv" REF="23">
THE fundamental principle of Mr. SMITH's theory is, that the
primary objects of our moral perceptions are the actions of other
men; and that our moral judgments with re&s;pect to our own
conduct are only applications to our&s;elves of deci&s;ions which we have
already pa&s;&s;ed on the conduct of our neighbour. His work accord|ingly
con&s;i&s;ts of two parts. In the former, he explains in what
manner we learn to judge of the conduct of our neighbour; in the
latter, in what manner, by applying the&s;e judgments to our&s;elves,
we acquire <HI>a &s;en&s;e of duty.</HI></P>
<P>Our moral judgments, both with re&s;pect to our own conduct
and that of others, include two di&s;tinct perceptions: <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> A percep|tion
of conduct as right or wrong: and, <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> A perception of
the merit or demerit of the agent. To that quality of conduct which
morali&s;ts, in general, expre&s;s by the word Rectitude, Mr. SMITH
gives the name of Propriety; and he begins his theory with enquir|ing
in what it con&s;i&s;ts, and how we are led to form the idea of it.
The leading principles of his doctrine on this &s;ubject are compre|hended
in the following propo&s;itions:</P>
<P>1. It is from our own experience alone, that we can form any
idea of what pa&s;&s;es in the mind of another per&s;on on any particular
occa&s;ion; and the only way in which we can form this idea, is by
&s;uppo&s;ing our&s;elves in the &s;ame circum&s;tances with him, and con|ceiving
how we &s;hould be affected if we were &s;o &s;ituated. It is
impo&s;&s;ible for us, however, to conceive our&s;elves placed in any &s;itu|ation,
whether agreeable or otherwi&s;e, without feeling an effect of
the &s;ame kind with what would be produced by the &s;ituation it&s;elf;
and of con&s;equence the attention we give at any time to the circum|&s;tances
of our neighbour, mu&s;t affect us &s;omewhat in the &s;ame man|ner,
although by no means in the &s;ame degree, as if the&s;e circum|&s;tances
were our own.</P>
<P><PB N="xxv" REF="24">
That this imaginary change of place with other men, is the real
&s;ource of the intere&s;t we take in their fortunes, Mr. SMITH attempts
to prove by various in&s;tances. &startq;When we &s;ee a &s;troke aimed, and
ju&s;t ready to fall upon the leg or arm of another per&s;on, we
naturally &s;hrink and draw back our own leg or our own arm;
and when it does fall, we feel it in &s;ome mea&s;ure, and are hurt by
it as well as the &s;ufferer. The mob, when they are gazing at a
dancer on the &s;lack rope, naturally writhe and twi&s;t and balance
their own bodies, as they &s;ee him do, and as they feel that they
them&s;elves mu&s;t do if in his &s;ituation.&endq; The &s;ame thing takes
place, according to Mr. SMITH, in every ca&s;e in which our attention
is turned to the condition of our neighbour. &startq;Whatever is the pa&s;|&s;ion
which ari&s;es from any object in the per&s;on principally con|cerned,
an analogous emotion &s;prings up, at the thought of his
&s;ituation, in the brea&s;t of every attentive &s;pectator. In every
pa&s;&s;ion of which the mind of man is &s;u&s;ceptible, the emotions of
the by-&s;tander always corre&s;pond to what, by bringing the ca&s;e home
to him&s;elf, he imagines &s;hould be the &s;entiments of the &s;ufferer.&endq;</P>
<P>To this principle of our nature which leads us to enter into the
&s;ituations of other men, and to partake with them in the pa&s;&s;ions
which the&s;e &s;ituations have a tendency to excite, Mr. SMITH gives
the name of <HI>&s;ympathy</HI> or <HI>fellow-feeling,</HI> which two words he employs
as &s;ynonymous. Upon &s;ome occa&s;ions, he acknowledges, that &s;ym|pathy
ari&s;es merely from the view of a certain emotion in another
per&s;on; but in general it ari&s;es, not &s;o much from the view of the
emotion, as from that of the &s;ituation which excites it.</P>
<P>2. A &s;ympathy or fellow-feeling between different per&s;ons is
always agreeable to both. When I am in a &s;ituation which excites
any pa&s;&s;ion, it is plea&s;ant to me to know, that the &s;pectators of my
&s;ituation enter with me into all its various circum&s;tances, and are
<PB N="xxvi" REF="25">
affected with them in the &s;ame manner as I am my&s;elf. On the
other hand, it is plea&s;ant to the &s;pectator to ob&s;erve this corre&s;pond|ence
of his emotions with mine.</P>
<P>3. When the &s;pectator of another man's fituation, upon bringing
home to him&s;elf all its various circum&s;tances, feels him&s;elf affected
in the &s;ame manner with the per&s;on principally concerned, he ap|proves
of the affection or pa&s;&s;ion of this per&s;on as ju&s;t and proper
and &s;uitable to its object. The exceptions which occur to this ob&s;er|vation
are, according to Mr. SMITH, only apparent. &startq;A &s;tranger,
for example, pa&s;&s;es by us in the &s;treet with all the marks of the
deepe&s;t affliction; and we are immediately told, that he has ju&s;t
received the news of the death of his father. It is impo&s;&s;ible
that, in this ca&s;e, we &s;hould not approve of his grief; yet it may
often happen, without any defect of humanity on our part, that,
&s;o far from entering into the violence of his &s;orrow, we &s;hould
&s;carce conceive the fir&s;t movements of concern upon his account.
We have learned, however, from experience, that &s;uch a misfor|tune
naturally excites &s;uch a degree of &s;orrow; and we know,
that if we took time to examine his &s;ituation fully and in all its
parts, we &s;hould, without doubt, mo&s;t &s;incerely &s;ympathize with
him. It is upon the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of this conditional &s;ympathy
that our approbation of his &s;orrow is founded, even in tho&s;e ca&s;es
in which that &s;ympathy does not actually take place; and the ge|neral
rules derived from our preceding experience of what our &s;en|timents
would commonly corre&s;pond with, correct upon this, as up|on
many other occa&s;ions, the impropriety of our pre&s;ent emotions.&endq;</P>
<P>By the <HI>propriety</HI> therefore of any affection or pa&s;&s;ion exhibited by
another per&s;on, is to be under&s;tood its &s;uitablene&s;s to the object
which excites it. Of this &s;uitablene&s;s I can judge only from the
coincidence of the affection with that which I feel, when I conceive
<PB N="xxvii" REF="26">
my&s;elf in the &s;ame circum&s;tances; and the perception of this coin|cidence
is the foundation of the &s;entiment of <HI>moral approbation.</HI></P>
<P>4. Although, when we attend to the &s;ituation of another per&s;on,
and conceive our&s;elves to be placed in his circum&s;tances, an emotion
of the &s;ame kind with that which he feels, naturally ari&s;es in our
own mind, yet this &s;ympathetic emotion bears but a very &s;mall
proportion, in point of degree, to what is felt by the per&s;on prin|cipally
concerned. In order, therefore, to obtain the plea&s;ure of
mutual &s;ympathy, nature teaches the &s;pectator to &s;trive as much as
he can, to rai&s;e his emotion to a level with that which the object
would really produce; and, on the other hand, &s;he teaches the
per&s;on who&s;e pa&s;&s;ion this object has excited, to bring it down, as
much as he can, to a level with that of the &s;pectator.</P>
<P>5. Upon the&s;e two different efforts are founded two different &s;ets
of virtues. Upon the effort of the &s;pectator to enter into the &s;itu|ation
of the per&s;on principally concerned, and to rai&s;e his &s;ympathetic
emotions to a level with the emotions of the actor, are founded the
gentle, the amiable virtues; the virtues of candid conde&s;cen&s;ion and
indulgent humanity. Upon the effort of the per&s;on principally con|cerned
to lower his own emotions, &s;o as to corre&s;pond as nearly as
po&s;&s;ible with tho&s;e of the &s;pectator, are founded the great, the awful,
and re&s;pectable virtues; the virtues of &s;elf-denial, of &s;elf-govern|ment,
of that command of the pa&s;&s;ions, which &s;ubjects all the
movements of our nature to what our own dignity and honour, and
the propriety of our own conduct, require.</P>
<P>As a farther illu&s;tration of the foregoing doctrine, Mr. SMITH
con&s;iders particularly the degrees of the different pa&s;&s;ions which are
con&s;i&s;tent with propriety, and endeavours to &s;hew, that in every
ca&s;e, it is decent or indecent to expre&s;s a pa&s;&s;ion &s;trongly, according
as mankind are di&s;po&s;ed, or not di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ympathize with it. It is
<PB N="xxviii" REF="27">
unbecoming, for example, to expre&s;s &s;trongly any of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions
which ari&s;e from a certain condition of the body; becau&s;e other
men, who are not in the &s;ame condition, cannot be expected to
&s;ympathize with them. It is unbecoming to cry out with bodily
pain; becau&s;e the &s;ympathy felt by the &s;pectator bears no proportion
to the acutene&s;s of what is felt by the &s;ufferer. The ca&s;e is &s;ome|what
&s;imilar with tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which take their origin from a par|ticular
turn or habit of the imagination.</P>
<P>In the ca&s;e of the un&s;ocial pa&s;&s;ions of hatred and re&s;entment, the
&s;ympathy of the &s;pectator is divided between the per&s;on who feels
the pa&s;&s;ion, and the per&s;on who is the object of it. &startq;We are con|cerned
for both, and our fear for what the one may &s;uffer damps
our re&s;entment for what the other has &s;uffered.&endq; Hence the im|perfect
degree in which we &s;ympathize with &s;uch pa&s;&s;ions; and the
propriety, when we are under their influence, of moderating their
expre&s;&s;ion to a much greater degree than is required in the ca&s;e of
any other emotions.</P>
<P>The rever&s;e of this takes place with re&s;pect to all the &s;ocial and
benevolent affections. The &s;ympathy of the &s;pectator with the
per&s;on who feels them, coincides with his concern for the per&s;on
who is the object of them. It is this redoubled &s;ympathy which
renders the&s;e affections &s;o peculiarly becoming and agreeable.</P>
<P>The &s;elfi&s;h emotions of grief and joy, when they are conceived
on account of our own private good or bad fortune, hold a &s;ort of
middle place between our &s;ocial and our un&s;ocial pa&s;&s;ions. They
are never &s;o graceful as the one &s;et, nor &s;o odious as the other.
Even when exce&s;&s;ive, they are never &s;o di&s;agreeable as exce&s;&s;ive re|&s;entment;
becau&s;e no oppo&s;ite &s;ympathy can ever intere&s;t us again&s;t
them: and when mo&s;t &s;uitable to their objects, they are never &s;o
agreeable as impartial humanity and ju&s;t benevolence; becau&s;e no
double &s;ympathy can ever intere&s;t us for them.</P>
<P><PB N="xxix" REF="28">
After the&s;e general &s;peculations concerning the propriety of ac|tions,
Mr. SMITH examines how far the judgments of mankind
concerning it are liable to be influenced in particular ca&s;es, by the
pro&s;perous or the adver&s;e circum&s;tances of the agent. The &s;cope
of his rea&s;oning on this &s;ubject is directed to &s;hew, (in oppo&s;ition
to the common opinion,) that when there is no envy in the ca&s;e,
our propen&s;ity to &s;ympathize with joy is much &s;tronger than our
propen&s;ity to &s;ympathize with &s;orrow; and, of con&s;equence, that it
is more ea&s;y to obtain the approbation of mankind in pro&s;perity
than in adver&s;ity. From the &s;ame principle he traces the origin of
ambition, or of the de&s;ire of rank and pre-eminence; the great ob|ject
of which pa&s;&s;ion is, to attain that &s;ituation which &s;ets a man
mo&s;t in the view of general &s;ympathy and attention, and gives him
an ea&s;y empire over the affections of others.</P>
<P>Having fini&s;hed the analy&s;is of our &s;en&s;e of propriety and of im|propriety,
Mr. SMITH proceeds to con&s;ider our &s;en&s;e of merit and
demerit; which he thinks has al&s;o a reference, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance,
not to our own characters, but to the characters of our neighbours.
In explaining the origin of this part of our moral con&s;titution, he
avails him&s;elf of the &s;ame principle of &s;ympathy, into which he re|&s;olves
the &s;entiment of moral approbation.</P>
<P>The words <HI>propriety</HI> and <HI>impropriety,</HI> when applied to an affection
of the mind, are u&s;ed in this theory (as has been already ob&s;erved)
to expre&s;s the &s;uitablene&s;s or un&s;uitablene&s;s of the affection to its ex|citing
<HI>cause.</HI> The words <HI>merit</HI> and <HI>demerit</HI> have always a reference
(according to Mr. SMITH) to the <HI>effect</HI> which the affection tends to
produce. When the tendency of an affection is beneficial, the agent
appears to us a proper object of reward; when it is hurtful, he ap|pears
the proper object of puni&s;hment.</P>
<P><PB N="xxx" REF="29">
The principles in our nature which mo&s;t directly prompt us to re|ward
and to puni&s;h, are gratitude and re&s;entment. To &s;ay of a per|&s;on,
therefore, that he is de&s;erving of reward or of puni&s;hment, is
to &s;ay, in other words, that he is a proper object of gratitude or of
re&s;entment; or, which amounts to the &s;ame thing, that he is to
&s;ome per&s;on or per&s;ons the object of a gratitude or of a re&s;entment,
which every rea&s;onable man is ready to adopt and &s;ympathize with.</P>
<P>It is however very nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that we do not thorough|ly
&s;ympathize with the gratitude of one man towards another,
merely becau&s;e this other has been the cau&s;e of his good fortune,
unle&s;s he has been the cau&s;e of it from motives which we entirely go
along with. Our &s;en&s;e, therefore, of the good de&s;ert of an action,
is a compounded &s;entiment, made up of an indirect &s;ympathy with
the per&s;on to whom the action is beneficial, and of a direct &s;ympathy
with the affections and motives of the agent.&mdash;The &s;ame remark
applies, <HI>mutatis inutandis,</HI> to our &s;en&s;e of demerit, or of ill-de&s;ert.</P>
<P>From the&s;e principles, it is inferred, that the only actions
which appear to us de&s;erving of reward, are actions of a bene|ficial
tendency, proceeding from proper motives; the only actions
which &s;eem to de&s;erve puni&s;hment, are actions of a hurtful tenden|cy,
proceeding from improper motives. A mere want of beneficence
expo&s;es to no puni&s;hment; becau&s;e the mere want of beneficence
tends to do no real po&s;itive evil. A man, on the other hand, who
is barely innocent, and contents him&s;elf with ob&s;erving &s;trictly the
laws of ju&s;tice with re&s;pect to others, can merit only, that his
neighbours, in their turn, &s;hould ob&s;erve religiou&s;ly the &s;ame laws
with re&s;pect to him.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations lead Mr. SMITH to anticipate a little the &s;ub|ject
of the &s;econd great divi&s;ion of his work, by a &s;hort enquiry
<PB N="xxxi" REF="30">
into the origin of our &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice <HI>as applicable to our own con|duct;</HI>
and al&s;o of our &s;entiments of remor&s;e, and of good de&s;ert.</P>
<P>The origin of our &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice, as well as of all our other
moral &s;entiments, he accounts for by means of the principle of
&s;ympathy. When I attend only to the feelings of my own brea&s;t,
my own happine&s;s appears to me of far greater con&s;equence than
that of all the world be&s;ides. But I am con&s;cious, that in this
exce&s;&s;ive preference, other men cannot po&s;&s;ibly &s;ympathize with
me, and that to them I appear only one of the crowd, in whom
they are no more intere&s;ted than in any other individual. If I wi&s;h,
therefore, to &s;ecure their &s;ympathy and approbation, (which, ac|cording
to Mr. SMITH, are the objects of the &s;tronge&s;t de&s;ire of
my nature,) it is nece&s;&s;ary for me to regard my happine&s;s, not in
that light in which it appears to my&s;elf, but in that light in which
it appears to mankind in general. If an unprovoked injury is of|fered
to me, I know that &s;ociety will &s;ympathize with my re&s;ent|ment;
but if I injure the intere&s;ts of another, who never injured
me, merely becau&s;e they &s;tand in the way of my own, I perceive
evidently, that &s;ociety will &s;ympathize with <HI>his</HI> re&s;entment, and
that I &s;hall become the object of general indignation.</P>
<P>When, upon any occa&s;ion, I am led by the violence of pa&s;&s;ion
to overlook the&s;e con&s;iderations, and, in the ca&s;e of a competition
of intere&s;ts, to act according to my own feelings, and not accord|ing
to tho&s;e of impartial &s;pectators, I never fail to incur the puni&s;h|ment
of remor&s;e. When my pa&s;&s;ion is gratified, and I begin to re|flect
coolly on my conduct, I can no longer enter into the mo|tives
from which it proceeded; it appears as improper to me as to
the re&s;t of the world; I lament the effects it has produced; I pity
the unhappy &s;ufferer whom I have injured; and I feel my&s;elf a ju&s;t
object of indignation to mankind. &startq;Such, &s;ays Mr. SMITH, is the
<PB N="xxxii" REF="31">
nature of that &s;entiment which is properly called remor&s;e. It is
made up of &s;hame from the &s;en&s;e of the impropriety of pa&s;t con|duct;
of grief for the effects of it; of pity for tho&s;e who &s;uffer by
it; and of the dread and terror of puni&s;hment from the con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s
of the ju&s;tly provoked re&s;entment of all rational creatures.&endq;</P>
<P>The oppo&s;ite behaviour of him who, from proper motives, has
performed a generous action, in&s;pires, in a &s;imilar manner, the op|po&s;ite
&s;entiment of con&s;cious merit, or of de&s;erved reward.</P>
<P>The foregoing ob&s;ervations contain a general &s;ummary of Mr.
SMITH'S principles with re&s;pect to the origin of our moral &s;enti|ments,
in &s;o far at lea&s;t as they relate to the conduct of others.
He acknowledges, at the &s;ame time, that the &s;entiments of which
we are con&s;cious, on particular occa&s;ions, do not always coincide
with the&s;e principles; and that they are frequently modified by
other con&s;iderations very different from the propriety or impropri|ety
of the affections of the agent, and al&s;o from the beneficial or
hurtful tendency of the&s;e affections. The good or the bad con&s;e|quences
which accidentally follow from an action, and which, as
they do not depend on the agent, ought undoubtedly, in point of
ju&s;tice, to have no influence on our opinion, either of the propri|ety
or the merit of his conduct, &s;carcely ever fail to influence
con&s;iderably our judgment with re&s;pect to both; by leading us to
form a good or a bad opinion of the prudence with which the ac|tion
was performed, and by animating our &s;en&s;e of the merit or
demerit of his de&s;ign. The&s;e facts, however, do not furni&s;h any
objections which are peculiarly applicable to Mr. SMITH'S theory;
for whatever hypothe&s;is we may adopt with re&s;pect to the origin of
our moral perceptions, all men must acknowledge, that in &s;o far as
the pro&s;perous or the unpro&s;perous event of an action depends on
fortune or on accident, it ought neither to increa&s;e nor to dimini&s;h
<PB N="xxxiii" REF="32">
our moral approbation or di&s;approbation of the agent. And accor|dingly
it has, in all ages of the world, been the complaint of mo|rali&s;ts,
that the actual &s;entiments of mankind &s;hould &s;o often be in
oppo&s;ition to this equitable and indi&s;putable maxim. In examining,
therefore, this irregularity of our moral &s;entiments, Mr. SMITH is
to be con&s;idered, not as obviating an objection peculiar to his own
&s;y&s;tem, but as removing a difficulty which is equally connected with
every theory on the &s;ubject which has ever been propo&s;ed. So
far as I know, he is the fir&s;t philo&s;opher who has been fully aware
of the importance of the difficulty, and he has indeed treated it
with great ability and &s;ucce&s;s. The explanation which he gives
of it is not warped in the lea&s;t by any peculiarity in his own
&s;cheme; and, I mu&s;t own, it appears to me to be the mo&s;t &s;olid
and valuable improvement he has made in this branch of &s;cience.
It is impo&s;&s;ible to give any ab&s;tract of it in a &s;ketch of this kind;
and therefore I mu&s;t content my&s;elf with remarking, that it con&s;i&s;ts
of three parts. The fir&s;t explains the cau&s;es of this irregularity of
&s;entiment; the &s;econd, the extent of its influence; and the third,
the important purpo&s;es to which it is &s;ub&s;ervient. His remarks on
the la&s;t of the&s;e heads are more particularly ingenious and plea&s;ing;
as their object is to &s;hew, in oppo&s;ition to what we &s;hould be di&s;|po&s;ed
at fir&s;t to apprehend, that when nature implanted the &s;eeds of
this irregularity in the human brea&s;t, her leading intention was, to
promote the happine&s;s and perfection of the &s;pecies.</P>
<P>The remaining part of Mr. SMITH's theory is employed in
&s;hewing, in what manner <HI>our &s;en&s;e of duty</HI> comes to be formed, in
con&s;equence of an application to our&s;elves of the judgments we
have previou&s;ly pa&s;&s;ed on the conduct of others.</P>
<P>In entering upon this enquiry, which is undoubtedly the mo&s;t
important in the work, and for which the foregoing &s;peculations
<PB N="xxxiv" REF="33">
are, according to Mr. SMITH's theory, a nece&s;&s;ary preparation, he
begins with &s;tating <HI>the fact</HI> concerning our con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of merited
prai&s;e or blame; and it mu&s;t be owned, that the fir&s;t a&s;pect of the
fact, as he him&s;elf &s;tates it, appears not very favourable to his prin|ciples.
That the great object of a wi&s;e and virtuous man is not to
act in &s;uch a manner as to obtain the actual approbation of tho&s;e
around him, but to act &s;o as to render him&s;elf the <HI>ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>proper</HI>
object of their approbation, and that his &s;atisfaction with his own con|duct
depends much more on the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>de&s;erving</HI> this ap|probation
than from that of really enjoying it, he candidly ac|knowledges;
but &s;till he in&s;i&s;ts, that although this may &s;eem, at
fir&s;t view, to intimate the exi&s;tence of &s;ome moral faculty which is
not borrowed from without, our moral &s;entiments have always
&s;ome &s;ecret reference, either to what are, or to what upon a certain
condition would be, or to what we imagine ought to be, the &s;enti|ments
of others; and that if it were po&s;&s;ible, that a human crea|ture
could grow up to manhood without any communication with
his own &s;pecies, he could no more think of his own character, or
of the propriety or demerit of his own &s;entiments and conduct,
than of the beauty or deformity of his own face. There is indeed
a tribunal within the brea&s;t, which is the &s;upreme arbiter of all our
actions, and which often mortifies us amid&s;t the applau&s;e, and &s;up|ports
us under the cen&s;ure of the world; yet &s;till, he contends, that
if we enquire into the origin of its in&s;titution, we &s;hall find, that
its juri&s;diction is, in a great mea&s;ure, derived from the authority
of that very tribunal who&s;e deci&s;ions it &s;o often and &s;o ju&s;tly re|ver&s;es.</P>
<P>When
we fir&s;t come into the world, we, for &s;ome time, fondly
pur&s;ue the impo&s;&s;ible project of gaining the good-will and approba|tion
of every body. We &s;oon however find, that this univer&s;al
approbation is unattainable; that the mo&s;t equitable conduct mu&s;t
<PB N="xxxv" REF="34">
frequently thwart the intere&s;ts or the inclinations of particular
per&s;ons, who will &s;eldom have candour enough to enter into the
propriety of our motives, or to &s;ee that this conduct, how di&s;agree|able
&s;oever to them, is perfectly &s;uitable to our &s;ituation. In order
to defend our&s;elves from &s;uch partial judgments, we &s;oon learn to
&s;et up in our own minds, a judge between our&s;elves and tho&s;e we
live with. We conceive our&s;elves as acting in the pre&s;ence of a
per&s;on, who has no particular relation, either to our&s;elves, or to
tho&s;e who&s;e intere&s;ts are affected by our conduct; and we &s;tudy to
act in &s;uch a manner as to obtain the approbation of this &s;uppo&s;ed
impartial &s;pectator. It is only by con&s;ulting him that we can &s;ee
whatever relates to our&s;elves in its proper &s;hape and dimen&s;ions.</P>
<P>There are two different occa&s;ions, on which we examine our
own conduct, and endeavour to view it in the light in which the
impartial &s;pectator would view it. Fir&s;t, when we are about to act;
and, &s;econdly, after we have acted. In both ca&s;es, our views are
very apt to be partial.</P>
<P>When we are about to act, the eagerne&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion &s;eldom allows
us to con&s;ider what we are doing with the candour of an indifferent
per&s;on. When the action is over, and the pa&s;&s;ions which prompted
it have &s;ub&s;ided, although we can undoubtedly enter into the &s;enti|ments
of the indifferent &s;pectator much more coolly than before,
yet it is &s;o di&s;agreeable to us to think ill of our&s;elves, that we often
purpo&s;ely turn away our view from tho&s;e circum&s;tances which
might render our judgment unfavourable.&mdash;Hence that &s;elf-deceit
which is the &s;ource of half the di&s;orders of human life.</P>
<P>In order to guard our&s;elves again&s;t its delu&s;ions, nature leads us to
form in&s;en&s;ibly, by our continual ob&s;ervations upon the conduct of
others, certain general rules concerning what is &s;it and proper either
<PB N="xxxvi" REF="35">
to be done or avoided. Some of their actions &s;hock all our na|tural
&s;entiments; and when we ob&s;erve other people affected in the
&s;ame manner with our&s;elves, we are confirmed in the belief, that
our di&s;approbation was ju&s;t. We naturally therefore lay it down
as a general rule, that all &s;uch actions are to be avoided, as tending
to render us odious, contemptible, or puni&s;hable; and we endeavour,
by habitual reflection, to fix this general rule in our minds, in order
to correct the mi&s;repre&s;entations of &s;elf-love, if we &s;hould ever be
called on to act in &s;imilar circum&s;tances. The man of furious re|&s;entment,
if he were to li&s;ten to the dictates of that pa&s;&s;ion, would
perhaps regard the death of his enemy as but a &s;mall compen&s;ation
for a trifling wrong. But his ob&s;ervations on the conduct of others
have taught him how horrible &s;uch &s;anguinary revenges are; and
he has impre&s;&s;ed it on his mind as an invariable rule, to ab&s;tain
from them upon all occa&s;ions. This rule pre&s;erves its authority
with him, checks the impetuo&s;ity of his pa&s;&s;ion, and corrects the
partial views which &s;elf-love &s;ugge&s;ts; although, if this had been
the fir&s;t time in which he con&s;idered &s;uch an action, he would un|doubtedly
have determined it to be ju&s;t and proper, and what every
impartial &s;pectator would approve of.&mdash;A regard to &s;uch general
rules of morality con&s;titutes, according to Mr. SMITH, what is pro|perly
called <HI>the &s;en&s;e of duty.</HI></P>
<P>I before hinted, that Mr. SMITH does not reject entirely from his
&s;y&s;tem that principle of <HI>utility,</HI> of which the perception in any ac|tion
or character con&s;titutes, according to Mr. HUME, the &s;enti|ment
of moral approbation. That no qualities of the mind are ap|proved
of as virtues, but &s;uch as are u&s;eful or agreeable, either to
the per&s;on himself or to others, he admits to be a propo&s;ition that
holds univer&s;ally; and he al&s;o admits, that the &s;entiment of appro|bation
with which we regard virtue, is enlivened by the percep|tion
of this utility, or, as he explains the fact, it is enlivened by
<PB N="xxxvii" REF="36">
our &s;ympathy with the happine&s;s of tho&s;e to whom the utility ex|tends:
But &s;till he in&s;i&s;ts, that it is not the view of this utility which
is either the fir&s;t or principal &s;ource of moral approbation.</P>
<P>To &s;um up the whole of his doctrine in a few words. &startq;When
we approve of any character or action, the &s;entiments which we
feel are derived from four different &s;ources. Fir&s;t, we &s;ympa|thize
with the motives of the agent; &s;econdly, we enter into the
gratitude of tho&s;e who receive the bene&s;it of his actions; thirdly,
we ob&s;erve that his conduct has been agreeable to the general
rules by which tho&s;e two &s;ympathies generally act; and, la&s;tly,
when we con&s;ider &s;uch actions as making a part of a &s;y&s;tem of
behaviour which tends to promote the happine&s;s either of the indi|vidual
or of &s;ociety, they appear to derive a beauty from this
utility, not unlike that which we a&s;cribe to any well-contrived
machine.&endq; The&s;e different &s;entiments, he thinks, exhau&s;t com|pletely,
in every in&s;tance that can be &s;uppo&s;ed, the compounded
&s;entiment of moral approbation. &startq;After deducting, &s;ays he, in
any one particular ca&s;e, all that mu&s;t be acknowledged to proceed
from &s;ome one or other of the&s;e four principles, I &s;hould be glad
to know what remains; and I &s;hall freely allow this overplus to
be a&s;cribed to a moral &s;en&s;e, or to any other peculiar faculty,
provided any body will a&s;certain preci&s;ely what this overplus is.&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. SMITH'S opinion concerning the nature of virtue, is involved
in his theory concerning the principle of moral approbation. The
idea of virtue, he thinks, always implies the idea of propriety, or
of the &s;uitablene&s;s of the affection to the object which excites
it; which &s;uitablene&s;s, according to him, can be determined in no
other way than by the &s;ympathy of impartial &s;pectators with the
motives or the agent. But &s;till he apprehends, that this de&s;cription
of virtue is incomplete; for although in every virtuous action pro|priety
<PB N="xxxviii" REF="37">
is an e&s;&s;ential ingredient, it is not always the &s;ole ingredient.
Beneficent actions have in them another quality, by which they
appear, not only to de&s;erve approbation, but recompence, and ex|cite
a &s;uperior degree of e&s;teem, ari&s;ing from a double &s;ympathy
with the motives of the agent, and the gratitude of tho&s;e who are
the objects of his affection. In this re&s;pect, beneficence appears
to him to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the inferior virtues of prudence,
vigilance, circum&s;pection, temperance, con&s;tancy, firmne&s;s, which
are always regarded with approbation, but which confer no merit.
This di&s;tinction, he apprehends, has not been &s;ufficiently attended
to by morali&s;ts; the principles of &s;ome affording no explanation of
the approbation we be&s;tow on the inferior virtues; and tho&s;e of
others accounting as imperfectly for the peculiar excellency which
the &s;upreme virtue of beneficence is acknowledged to po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>Such are the outlines of Mr. SMITH's Theory of Moral Senti|ments;
a work which, whatever opinion we may entertain of the
ju&s;tne&s;s of its conclu&s;ions, mu&s;t be allowed by all to be a &s;ingular
effort of invention, ingenuity, and &s;ubtilty. For my own part I
mu&s;t confe&s;s, that it does not coincide with my notions concerning
the foundation of Morals; but I am convinced, at the &s;ame time,
that it contains a large mixture of important truth, and that, al|though
the author has &s;ometimes been mi&s;led by too great a de&s;ire
of generalizing his principles, he has had the merit of directing the
attention of philo&s;ophers to a view of human nature which had
formerly in a great mea&s;ure e&s;caped their notice. Of the great pro|portion
of ju&s;t and found rea&s;oning which the theory involves, its
&s;triking plau&s;ibility is a &s;ufficient proof; for as the author him&s;elf
has remarked, no &s;y&s;tem in morals can well gain our a&s;&s;ent, if it
does not border, in &s;ome re&s;pects, upon the truth. &startq;A &s;y&s;tem of
natural philo&s;ophy, (he ob&s;erves,) may appear very plau&s;ible, and
be for a long time very generally received in the world, and
<PB N="xxxix" REF="38">
yet have no foundation in nature; but the author who &s;hould
a&s;&s;ign as the cau&s;e of any natural &s;entiment, &s;ome principle which
neither had any connection with it, nor re&s;embled any other
principle which had &s;ome connection, would appear ab&s;urd and
ridiculous to the mo&s;t injudicious and unexperienced reader.&endq;
The merit, however, of Mr. SMITH's performance does not re&s;t
here. No work, undoubtedly, can be mentioned, ancient or mo|dern,
which exhibits &s;o complete a view of tho&s;e facts with re&s;pect
to our moral perceptions, which it is one great object of this branch
of &s;cience to refer to their general laws; and upon this account, it
well de&s;erves the careful &s;tudy of all who&s;e ta&s;te leads them to pro|&s;ecute
&s;imilar enquiries. The&s;e facts are indeed frequently expre&s;&s;ed
in a language which involves the author's peculiar theories: But
they are always pre&s;ented in the mo&s;t happy and beautiful lights;
and it is ea&s;y for an attentive reader, by &s;tripping them of hypo|thetical
terms, to &s;tate them to him&s;elf with that logical preci&s;ion,
which, in &s;uch very difficult di&s;qui&s;itions, can alone conduct us
with certainty to the truth.</P>
<P>It is proper to ob&s;erve farther, that with the theoretical doctrines
of the book, there are every where interwoven, with &s;ingular ta&s;te
and addre&s;s, the pure&s;t and mo&s;t elevated maxims concerning the
practical conduct of life; and that it abounds throughout with in|tere&s;ting
and in&s;tructive delineations of characters and manners.
A con&s;iderable part of it too is employed in collateral enquiries,
which, upon every hypothe&s;is that can be formed concerning the
foundation of morals, are of equal importance. Of this kind is the
&s;peculation formerly mentioned, with re&s;pect to the influence of
fortune on our moral &s;entiments, and another &s;peculation, no le&s;s
valuable, with re&s;pect to the influence of cu&s;tom and fa&s;hion on the
&s;ame part of our con&s;titution.</P>
<P><PB N="xl" REF="39">
The &s;tyle in which Mr. SMITH has conveyed the fundamental
principles on which his theory re&s;ts, does not &s;eem to me to be &s;o
perfectly fuited to the &s;ubject as that which he employs on mo&s;t
other occa&s;ions. In communicating ideas which are extremely ab|&s;tract
and &s;ubtile, and about which it is hardly po&s;&s;ible to rea&s;on
correctly, without the &s;crupulous u&s;e of appropriated terms, he
&s;ometimes pre&s;ents to us a choice of words, by no means &s;trictly
&s;ynonymous, &s;o as to divert the attention from a preci&s;e and &s;teady
conception of his propo&s;ition; and a &s;imilar effect is, in other in|&s;tances,
produced by that diver&s;ity of forms which, in the cour&s;e
of his copious and &s;educing compo&s;ition, the &s;ame truth in&s;en&s;ibly
a&s;&s;umes. When the &s;ubject of his work leads him to addre&s;s the
imagination and the heart; the variety and felicity of his illu&s;tra|tions;
the richne&s;s and fluency of his eloquence; and the &s;kill
with which he wins the attention and commands the pa&s;&s;ions of his
readers, leave him, among our Engli&s;h morali&s;ts, without a rival.</P>
<P>THE Di&s;&s;ertation on the Origin of Languages, which now forms
a part of the &s;ame volume with the Theory of Moral Sentiments,
was, I believe, fir&s;t annexed to the &s;econd edition of that work. It
is an e&s;&s;ay of great ingenuity, and on which the author him&s;elf &s;et
a high value; but, in a general review of his publications, it de|&s;erves
our attention le&s;s, on account of the opinions it contains, than
as a &s;pecimen of a particular &s;ort of enquiry, which, &s;o far as I
know, is entirely of modern origin, and which &s;eems, in a pecu|liar
degree, to have intere&s;ted Mr. SMITH's curio&s;ity. Something
very &s;imilar to it may be traced in all his different works, whether

When, in &s;uch a period of &s;ociety as that in which we live, we
compare our intellectual acquirements, our opinions, manners, and
in&s;titutions, with tho&s;e which prevail among rude tribes, it cannot
fail to occur to us as an intere&s;ting que&s;tion, by what gradual &s;teps
the tran&s;ition has been made from the fir&s;t &s;imple efforts of uncul|tivated
nature, to a &s;tate of things &s;o wonderfully arti&s;icial and com|plicated.
Whence has ari&s;en that &s;y&s;tematical beauty which we ad|mire
in the &s;tructure of a cultivated language; that analogy which
runs through the mixture of languages &s;poken by the mo&s;t remote
and unconnected nations; and tho&s;e peculiarities by which they are
all di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other? Whence the origin of the differ|ent
&s;ciences and of the different arts; and by what chain has the mind
been led from their fir&s;t rudiments to their la&s;t and mo&s;t re&s;ined im|provements?
Whence the a&s;toni&s;hing fabric of the political union;
the fundamental principles which are common to all governments;
and the different forms which civilized &s;ociety has a&s;&s;umed in dif|ferent
ages of the world? On mo&s;t of the&s;e &s;ubjects very little in|formation
is to be expected from hi&s;tory; for long before that &s;tage
of &s;ociety when men begin to think of recording their tran&s;actions,
many of the mo&s;t important &s;teps of their progre&s;s have been made.
A few in&s;ulated facts may perhaps be collected from the ca&s;ual ob|&s;ervations
of travellers, who have viewed the arrangements of rude
nations; but nothing, it is evident, can be obtained in this way,
which approaches to a regular and connected detail of human im|provement.</P>
<P>In this want of direct evidence, we are under a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;up|plying
the place of fact by conjecture; and when we are unable to
a&s;certain how men have actually conducted them&s;elves upon parti|cular
occa&s;ions, of con&s;idering in what manner they are likely to
have proceeded, from the principles of their nature, and the cir|cum&s;tances
of their external &s;ituation. In &s;uch enquiries, the de|tached
<PB N="xlii" REF="41">
facts which travels and voyages afford us, may frequently
&s;erve as land-marks to our &s;peculations; and &s;ometimes our con|clu&s;ions
<HI>a priori,</HI> may tend to confirm the credibility of facts, which,
on a &s;uperficial view, appeared to be doubtful or incredible.</P>
<P>Nor are &s;uch theoretical views of human affairs &s;ub&s;ervient merely
to the gratification of curi&s;ity. In examining the hi&s;tory of man|kind,
as well as in examining the phenomena of the material
world, when we cannot trace the proce&s;s by which an event <HI>has
been</HI> produced, it is often of importance to be able to &s;hew how it
<HI>may have been</HI> produced by natural cau&s;es. Thus, in the in&s;tance
which has &s;ugge&s;ted the&s;e remarks, although it is impo&s;&s;ible to de|termine
with certainty what the &s;teps were by which any particular
language was formed, yet if we can &s;hew, from the known prin|ciples
of human nature, how all its various parts might gradually
have ari&s;en, the mind is not only to a certain degree &s;atisfied, but
a check is given to that indolent philo&s;ophy, which refers to a mi|racle,
whatever appearances, both in the natural and moral worlds,
it is unable to explain.</P>
<P>To this &s;pecies of philo&s;ophical inve&s;tigation, which has no ap|propriated
name in our language, I &s;hall take the liberty of giving
the title of <HI>Theoretical</HI> or <HI>Conjectural Hi&s;tory;</HI> an expre&s;&s;ion which
coincides pretty nearly in its meaning with that of <HI>Natural Hi&s;tory,</HI>
as employed by Mr. HUME<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See his Natural Hi&s;tory of Religion.</NOTE>, and with what &s;ome French writers
have called <HI>Hi&s;toire Rai&s;onn&eacute;e.</HI></P>
<P>The mathematical &s;ciences, both pure and mixed, afford, in many
of their branches, very favourable &s;ubjects for theoretical hi&s;tory; and
a very competent judge, the late M. d'ALEMBERT, has recommend|ed
<PB N="xliii" REF="42">
this arrangement of their elementary principles, which is founded
on the natural &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of inventions and di&s;coveries, as the be&s;t
adapted for intere&s;ting the curio&s;ity and exerci&s;ing the genius of &s;tu|dents.
The &s;ame author points out as a model a pa&s;&s;age in MON|TUCLA's
Hi&s;tory of Mathematics, where an attempt is made to ex|hibit
the gradual progre&s;s of philo&s;ophical &s;peculation, from the fir&s;t
conclu&s;ions &s;ugge&s;ted by a general &s;urvey of the heavens, to the
doctrines of COPERNICUS. It is &s;omewhat remarkable, that a theo|retical
hi&s;tory of this very &s;cience (in which we have, perhaps, a
better opportunity than in any other in&s;tance whatever, of comparing
the natural advances of the mind with the actual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of hy|pothetical
&s;y&s;tems) was one of Mr. SMITH's earlie&s;t compo&s;itions,
and is one of the very &s;mall number of his manu&s;cripts which he
did not de&s;troy before his death.</P>
<P>I already hinted, that enquiries perfectly analagous to the&s;e may
be applied to the modes of government, and to the municipal in&s;ti|tutions
which have obtained among different nations. It is but
lately, however, that the&s;e important &s;ubjects have been con&s;idered
in this point of view; the greater part of politicians before the time
of MONTESQUIEU, having contented them&s;elves with an hi&s;torical
&s;tatement of facts, and with a vague reference of laws to the wi&s;dom
of particular legi&s;lators, or to accidental circum&s;tances, which it is
now impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain. MONTESQUIEU, on the contrary,
con&s;idered laws as originating chiefly from the circum&s;tances of &s;o|ciety;
and attempted to account, from the changes in the condition
of mankind, which take place in the different &s;tages of their pro|gre&s;s,
for the corre&s;ponding alterations which their in&s;titutions un|dergo.
It is thus, that in his occa&s;ional elucidations of the Roman
juri&s;prudence, in&s;tead of bewildering him&s;elf among the erudition
of &s;cholia&s;ts and of antiquaries, we frequently find him borrowing
his lights from the mo&s;t remote and unconnected quarters of the
<PB N="xliv" REF="43">
globe, and combining the ca&s;ual ob&s;ervations of illiterate travellers
and navigators, into a philo&s;ophical commentary on the hi&s;tory of
law and of manners.</P>
<P>The advances made in this line of enquiry &s;ince MONTES|QUIEU's
time have been great. Lord KAMES, in his Hi&s;torical
Law Tracts, has given &s;ome excellent &s;pecimens of it, particularly in
his E&s;&s;ays on the Hi&s;tory of Property and of Criminal Law, and
many ingenious &s;peculations of the &s;ame kind occur in the works of
Mr. MILLAR.</P>
<P>In Mr. SMITH's writings, whatever be the nature of his &s;ubject,
he &s;eldom mi&s;&s;es an opportunity of indulging his curio&s;ity, in tracing
from the principles of human nature, or from the circum&s;tances of
&s;ociety, the origin of the opinions and the in&s;titutions which he de|&s;cribes.
I formerly mentioned a fragment concerning the Hi&s;tory
of A&s;tronomy which he has left for publication; and I have heard
him &s;ay more than once, that he had projected, in the earlier part of
his life, a hi&s;tory of the other &s;ciences on the &s;ame plan. In his
Wealth of Nations, various di&s;qui&s;itions are introduced which have
a like object in view, particularly the theoretical delineation he has
given of the natural progre&s;s of opulence in a country; and his in|ve&s;tigation
of the cau&s;es which have inverted this order in the dif|ferent
countries of modern Europe. His lectures on juri&s;prudence
&s;eem, from the account of them formerly given, to have abounded
in &s;uch enquiries.</P>
<P>I am informed by the &s;ame gentleman who favoured me with the
account of Mr. SMITH's lectures at Gla&s;gow, that he had heard him
&s;ometimes hint an intention of writing a treati&s;e upon the Greek
and Roman republics. &startq;And after all that has been publi&s;hed on
that &s;ubject, I am convinced (&s;ays he), that the ob&s;ervations of
<PB N="xlv" REF="44">
Mr. SMITH would have &s;ugge&s;ted many new and important
views concerning the internal and dome&s;tic circum&s;tances of tho&s;e
nations, which would have di&s;played their &s;everal &s;y&s;tems of po|licy,
in a light much le&s;s artificial than that in which they have hi|therto
appeared.&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;ame turn of thinking was frequently, in his &s;ocial hours,
applied to more familiar &s;ubjects; and the fanciful theories which,
without the lea&s;t affectation of ingenuity, he was continually &s;tart|ing
upon all the common topics of di&s;cour&s;e, gave to his conver&s;a|tion
a novelty and variety that were quite inexhau&s;tible. Hence too
the minutene&s;s and accuracy of his knowledge on many trifling ar|ticles
which, in the cour&s;e of his &s;peculations, he had been led to
con&s;ider from &s;ome new and intere&s;ting point of view; and of
which his lively and circum&s;tantial de&s;criptions amu&s;ed his friends
the more, that he &s;eemed to be habitually inattentive, in &s;o remark|able
a degree, to what was pa&s;&s;ing around him.</P>
<P>I have been led into the&s;e remarks by the Di&s;&s;ertation on the For|mation
of Languages, which exhibits a very beautiful &s;pecimen of
theoretical hi&s;tory, applied to a &s;ubject equally curious and difficult.
The analogy between the train of thinking from which it has taken its
ri&s;e, and that which has &s;ugge&s;ted a variety of his other di&s;qui&s;itions,
will, I hope, be a &s;ufficient apology for the length of this digre&s;&s;ion;
more particularly, as it will enable me to &s;implify the account
which I am to give afterwards, of his enquiries concerning political
oeconomy.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only ob&s;erve farther on this head, that when different theo|retical
hi&s;tories are propo&s;ed by different writers, of the progre&s;s of
the human mind in any one line of exertion, the&s;e theories are not
<PB N="xlvi" REF="45">
always to be under&s;tood as &s;tanding in oppo&s;ition to each other. If
the progre&s;s delineated in all of them be plau&s;ible, it is po&s;&s;ible at
lea&s;t, that they may all have been realized; for human affairs never
exhibit, in any two in&s;tances, a perfect uniformity. But whether
they have been realized or no, is often a que&s;tion of little con&s;e|quence.
In mo&s;t ca&s;es, it is of more importance to a&s;certain the pro|gre&s;s
that is mo&s;t &s;imple, than the progre&s;s that is mo&s;t agreeable to
fact; for, paradoxical as the propo&s;ition may appear, it is certainly
true, that the real progre&s;s is not always the mo&s;t natural. It may
have been determined by particular accidents, which are not likely
again to occur, and which cannot be con&s;idered as forming any part
of that general provi&s;ion which nature has made for the improvement
of the race.</P>
<P>IN order to make &s;ome amends for the length (I am afraid I
may add for the tediou&s;ne&s;s) of this &s;ection, I &s;hall &s;ubjoin to it an
original letter of Mr. HUME's, addre&s;&s;ed to Mr. SMITH, &s;oon after
the publication of his Theory. It is &s;trongly marked with that
ea&s;y and affectionate plea&s;antry which di&s;tingui&s;hed Mr. HUME's
epi&s;tolary corre&s;pondence, and is entitled to a place in this Memoir,
on account of its connection with an important event of Mr. SMITH's
life, which &s;oon after removed him into a new &s;cene, and influenced,
to a con&s;iderable degree, the &s;ub&s;equent cour&s;e of his &s;tudies. The
letter is dated from London, 12th April 1759.</P>
<P>&startq;I give you thanks for the agreeable pre&s;ent of your Theory.
WEDDERBURN and I made pre&s;ents of our copies to &s;uch of our ac|quaintances
as we thought good judges, and proper to &s;pread the
<PB N="xlvii" REF="46">
reputation of the book. I &s;ent one to the Duke of ARGYLE, to
Lord LYTTLETON, HORACE WALPOLE, SOAME JENNYNS, and
BURKE, an Iri&s;h gentleman, who wrote lately a very pretty trea|ti&s;e
on the Sublime. MILLAR de&s;ired my permi&s;&s;ion to &s;end one
in your name to Dr. WARBURTON. I have delayed writing to
you till I could tell you &s;omething of the &s;ucce&s;s of the book, and
could progno&s;ticate with &s;ome probability, whether it &s;hould be
finally damned to oblivion, or &s;hould be regi&s;tered in the temple of
immortality. Though it has been publi&s;hed only a few weeks, I
think there appear already &s;uch &s;trong &s;ymptoms, that I can almo&s;t
venture to foretel its fate. It is in &s;hort this&mdash;But I have
been interrupted in my letter by a fooli&s;h impertinent vi&s;it of one
who has lately come from Scotland. He tells me that the Univer|sity
of Gla&s;gow intend to declare ROUET's office vacant, upon his
going abroad with Lord HOPE. I que&s;tion not but you will have
our friend FERGUSON in your eye, in ca&s;e another project for pro|curing
him a place in the Univer&s;ity of Edinburgh &s;hould fail.
FERGUSON has very much poli&s;hed and improved his treati&s;e on
Refinement<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Publi&s;hed afterwards under the title of &startq;An E&s;&s;ay on the Hi&s;tory of Civil Society.&endq;</NOTE>, and with &s;ome amendments it will make an admir|able
book, and di&s;covers an elegant and a &s;ingular genius. The
Epigoniad, I hope, will do; but it is &s;omewhat up-hill work. As
I doubt not but you con&s;ult the reviews &s;ometimes at pre&s;ent, you
will &s;ee in the Critical Review a letter upon that poem; and I de&s;ire
you to employ your conjectures in finding out the author. Let me
&s;ee a &s;ample of your &s;kill in knowing hands by your gue&s;&s;ing at the
per&s;on. I am afraid of Lord KAMES's Law Tracts. A man might
as well think of making a fine &s;auce by a mixture of wormwood and
aloes, as an agreeable compo&s;ition by joining metaphy&s;ics and Scotch
law. However, the book, I believe, has merit; though few people
will take the pains of diving into it. But, to return to your book,
<PB N="xlviii" REF="47">
and its &s;ucce&s;s in this town, I mu&s;t tell you&mdash;A plague of
interruptions! I ordered my&s;elf to be denied; and yet here is one
that has broke in upon me again. He is a man of letters, and we
have had a good deal of literary conver&s;ation. You told me that you
was curious of literary anecdotes, and therefore I &s;hall inform you
of a few that have come to my knowledge. I believe I have men|tioned
to you already HELVETIUS's book <HI>de l'E&s;prit.</HI> It is worth
your reading, not for its philo&s;ophy, which I do not highly value,
but for its agreeable compo&s;ition. I had a letter from him a few days
ago, wherein he tells me that my name was much oftener in the
manu&s;cript, but that the Cen&s;or of books at Paris obliged him to
&s;trike it out. VOLTAIRE has lately publi&s;hed a &s;mall work called
<HI>Candide, oul'Optimi&s;ine.</HI> I &s;hall give you a detail of it&mdash;But what
is all this to my book? &s;ay you.&mdash;My dear Mr. SMITH, have patience:
Compo&s;e your&s;elf to tranquillity: Shew your&s;elf a philo&s;opher in
practice as well as profe&s;&s;ion: Think on the emptine&s;s, and ra&s;hne&s;s,
and futility of the common judgments of men: How little they are
regulated by rea&s;on in any &s;ubject, much more in philo&s;ophical &s;ub|jects,
which &s;o far exceed the comprehen&s;ion of the vulgar.</P>

<L>Elevet, accedas: examenve improbum in illa</L>
<L>Ca&s;tiges trutina: nec te quae&s;iveris extra.</L></Q>
<P>A wi&s;e man's kingdom is his own brea&s;t; or, if he ever looks
farther, it will only be to the judgment of a &s;elect few, who are
free from prejudices, and capable of examining his work. Nothing
indeed can be a &s;tronger pre&s;umption of fal&s;ehood than the appro|bation
of the multitude; and PHOCION, you know, always &s;u&s;pect|ed
him&s;elf of &s;ome blunder, when he was attended with the ap|plau&s;es
of the populace.</P>
<P><PB N="xlix" REF="48">
&startq;Suppo&s;ing, therefore, that you have duly prepared your&s;elf for
the wor&s;t by all the&s;e reflections, I proceed to tell you the melancho|ly
news, that your book has been very unfortunate; for the public
&s;eem di&s;po&s;ed to applaud it extremely. It was looked for by the
fooli&s;h people with &s;ome impatience; and the mob of literati are be|ginning
already to be very loud in its prai&s;es. Three Bi&s;hops called
ye&s;terday at MILLAR'S &s;hop in order to buy copies, and to a&s;k
que&s;tions about the author. The Bi&s;hop of PETERBOROUGH
&s;aid he had pa&s;&s;ed the evening in a company where he heard it ex|tolled
above all books in the world. The Duke of ARGYLE is more
deci&s;ive than he u&s;es to be in its favour. I &s;uppo&s;e he either con|&s;iders
it as an exotic, or thinks the author will be &s;erviceable to him
in the Gla&s;gow elections. Lord LYTTLELON &s;ays, that ROBERT|SON
and SMITH and BOWER are the glories of Engli&s;h literature.
OSWALD prote&s;ts he does not know whether he has reaped more
in&s;truction or entertainment from it. But you may ea&s;ily judge
what reliance can be put on his judgment, who has been engaged all
his life in public bu&s;ine&s;s, and who never &s;ees any faults in his friends.
MILLAR exults and brags that two thirds of the edition are already
&s;old, and that he is now &s;ure of &s;ucce&s;s. You &s;ee what a &s;on of
the earth that is, to value books only by the profit they bring him.
In that view, I believe it may prove a very good book.</P>
<P>&startq;CHARLES TOWNSEND, who pa&s;&s;es for the clevere&s;t fellow
in England, is &s;o taken with the performance, that he &s;aid to
OSWALD he would put the Duke of BUCCLEUGH under the au|thor's
care, and would make it worth his while to accept of that
charge. As &s;oon as I heard this, I called on him twice, with a view
of talking with him about the matter, and of convincing him of the
propriety of &s;ending that young Nobleman to Gla&s;gow: For I could
not hope, that he could offer you any terms which would tempt you
to renounce your Profe&s;&s;or&s;hip: But I mi&s;&s;ed him. Mr. TOWNSEND

<HEAD>SECTION III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">From the Publication of The Theory of Moral Sentiments, till
that of The Wealth of Nations.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER the publication of the Theory of Moral Sentiments, Mr.
SMITH remained four years at Gla&s;gow, di&s;charging his official
duties with unabated vigour, and with increa&s;ing reputation.
During that time, the plan of his lectures underwent a con&s;iderable
change. His ethical doctrines, of which he had now publi&s;hed &s;o
valuable a part, occupied a much &s;maller portion of the cour&s;e than
formerly: and accordingly, his attention was naturally directed to
a more complete illu&s;tration of the principles of juri&s;prudence and of
political oeconomy.</P>
<P>To this la&s;t &s;ubject, his thoughts appear to have been occa&s;ionally
turned from a very early period of life. It is probable, that the un|interrupted
<PB N="li" REF="50">
friend&s;hip he had always maintained with his old com|panion
Mr. OSWALD had &s;ome tendency to encourage him in pro|&s;ecuting
this branch of his &s;tudies; and the publication of Mr.
HUME's political di&s;cour&s;es in the year 1752, could not fail to con|firm
him in tho&s;e liberal views of commercial policy which had
already opened to him in the cour&s;e of his own enquiries. His long
re&s;idence in one of the mo&s;t enlightened mercantile towns in this
i&s;land, and the habits of intimacy in which he lived with the mo&s;t
re&s;pectable of its inhabitants, afforded him an opportunity of deriv|ing
what commercial information he &s;tood in need of, from the
be&s;t &s;ources; and it is a circum&s;tance no le&s;s honourable to their li|berality
than to his talents, that notwith&s;tanding the reluctance
&s;o common among men of bu&s;ine&s;s to li&s;ten to the conclu&s;ions of
mere &s;peculation, and the direct oppo&s;ition of his leading principles
to all the old maxims of trade, he was able, before he quitted his
&s;ituation in the Univer&s;ity, to rank &s;ome very eminent merchants in
the number of his pro&s;elytes<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">I mention this fact on the re&s;pectable authority of JAMES RITCHIE, Efq. of Gla&s;gow.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Among the &s;tudents who attended his lectures, and who&s;e minds
were not previou&s;ly warped by prejudice, the progre&s;s of his opi|nions,
it may be rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed, was much more rapid. It was
this cla&s;s of his friends accordingly that fir&s;t adopted his &s;y&s;tem with
eagerne&s;s, and diffu&s;ed a knowledge of its fundamental principles
over this part of the kingdom.</P>
<P>Towards the end of 1763, Mr. SMITH received an invitation
from Mr. CHARLES TOWNSEND to accompany the Duke of BUC|CLEUGH
on his travels; and the liberal terms in which the propo&s;al
was made to him, added to the &s;trong de&s;ire he had felt of vi&s;iting
the Continent of Europe, induced him to re&s;ign his office at
<PB N="lii" REF="51">
Gla&s;gow. With the connection which he was led to form in con&s;e|quence
of this change in his &s;ituation, he had rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied
in an uncommon degree, and he always &s;poke of it with plea&s;ure
and gratitude. To the public, it was not perhaps a change equally
fortunate; as it interrupted that &s;tudious lei&s;ure for which nature
&s;eems to have deftined him, and in which alone he could have hoped
to accompli&s;h tho&s;e literary projects which had flattered the am|bition
of his youthful genius.</P>
<P>The alteration, however, which, from this period, took place in
his habits, was not without its advantages. He had hitherto lived
chiefly within the walls of an Univer&s;ity; and although to a mind
like his, the ob&s;ervation of human nature on the &s;malle&s;t &s;cale is
&s;ufficient to convey a tolerably ju&s;t conception of what pa&s;&s;es on the
great theatre of the world, yet it is not to be doubted, that the va|riety
of &s;cenes through which he afterwards pa&s;&s;ed, mu&s;t have en|riched
his mind with many new ideas, and corrected many of tho&s;e
mi&s;apprehen&s;ions of life and manners which the be&s;t de&s;criptions of
them can &s;carcely fail to convey.&mdash;But whatever were the lights
that his travels afforded to him as a &s;tudent of human nature, they
were probably u&s;eful in a &s;till greater degree, in enabling him to
perfect that &s;yftem of political $conomy, of which he had already
delivered the principles in his lectures at Glafgow, and which it
was now the leading object of his fludies to prepare for the public.
The coincidence between &s;ome of the&s;e principles and the di&s;tingui&s;h|ing
tenets of the French $conomi&s;ts, who were at that very time in
the height of their reputation, and the intimacy in which he lived
with &s;ome of the leaders of that &s;ect, could not fail to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in
inethodizing and dige&s;ting his &s;peculations; while the valuable col|lection
of facts, accumulated by the zealous indu&s;try of their nu|merous

After leaving Gla&s;gow, Mr. SMITH joined the Duke of BUC|CLEUGH
at London early in the year 1764, and &s;et out with him
for the Continent in the month of March following. At Dover they
were met by Sir JAMES MACDONALD, who accompanied them to
Paris, and with whom Mr. SMITH laid the foundation of a friend&s;hip,
which he always mentioned with great &s;en&s;ibility, and of which he
often lamented the &s;hort duration. The panegyrics with which the
memory of this accompli&s;hed and amiable per&s;on has been honoured
by &s;o many di&s;tingui&s;hed characters in the different countries of
Europe, are a proof how well fitted his talents were to command
general admiration. The e&s;teem in which his abilities and learning
were held by Mr. SMITH, is a te&s;timony to his extraordinary merit
of &s;till &s;uperior value. Mr. HUME, too, &s;eems, in this in&s;tance, to
have partaken of his friend's enthu&s;ia&s;m. &startq;Were you and I toge|ther,
(&s;ays he in a letter to Mr. SMITH,) we &s;hould &s;hed tears at
pre&s;ent for the death of poor Sir JAMES MACDONALD. We
could not po&s;&s;ibly have &s;uffered a greater lo&s;s than in that valuable
young man.&endq;</P>
<P>In this fir&s;t vi&s;it to Paris, the Duke of BUCCLEUGH and Mr.
SMITH employed only ten or twelve days,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>The day after his arrival at Paris, Mr. SMITH &s;ent a formal re&s;ignation of his Profe&s;&s;or&s;hip to the Rector of the Univer&s;ity of Gla&s;gow. &startq;I never was more anx|ious (&s;ays he in the conclu&s;ion of this letter) for the good of the College, than at this moment; and I &s;incerely with, that whoever is my &s;ucce&s;&s;or may not only do credit to the office by his abilities, but be a comfort to the very excellent men with whom he is likely to &s;pend his life, by the probity of his heart, and the goodne&s;s of his temper.&endq;</P>
<P>The following extract from the records of the Univer&s;ity, which follows immediately after Mr. SMITH's letter of re&s;ignation, is at once a te&s;timony to his a&s;&s;iduity as a Pro|fe&s;&s;or, and a proof of the ju&s;t &s;en&s;e which that learned body entertained of the talents and worth of the colleague they had lo&s;t:</P>
<P>&startq;The meeting accept of Dr. SMITH'S re&s;ignation, in terms of the above letter, and the office of Profe&s;&s;or of Moral Philo&s;ophy in this Univer&s;ity is therefore hereby declared to be vacant. The Univer&s;ity, at the fame time, cannot help expre&s;&s;ing their &s;incere regret at the removal of Dr. SMITH, who&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed probity and amiable qualitics procured him the e&s;teem and affection of his colleagues; and who&s;e uncommon genius, great abilities, and exten&s;ive learning, did &s;o much honour to this &s;ociety; his elegant and ingenious Theory of Moral Sentiments having re|commended him to the e&s;teem of men of ta&s;te and literature throughout Europe. His happy talent in illu&s;trating ab&s;tracted &s;ubjects, and faithful a&s;&s;iduity in commu|nicating u&s;eful knowledge, di&s;tingui&s;hed him as a Profe&s;&s;or, and at once afforded the greate&s;t plea&s;ure and the mo&s;t important in&s;truction to the youth under his care.&endq;</P></NOTE>, after which they pro|ceeded
<PB N="liv" REF="53">
to Thoulou&s;e, where they fixed their re&s;idence for eighteen
months; and where, in addition to the plea&s;ure of an agrecable &s;o|ciety,
Mr. SMITH had an opportunity of correcting and extending
his information concerning the internal policy of France, by the in|timacy
in which he lived with &s;ome of the principal per&s;ons of the
Parliament.</P>
<P>From Thoulou&s;e they went, by a pretty exten&s;ive tour, through
the &s;outh of France to Geneva. Here they pa&s;&s;ed two months.
The late Earl STANHOPE, for who&s;e learning and worth Mr.
SMITH entertained &s;incere re&s;pect, was then an inhabitant of that
republic.</P>
<P>About Chri&s;tmas 1765, they returned to Paris, and remained there
till October following. The &s;ociety in which Mr. SMITH &s;pent
the&s;e ten months, may be conceived from the advantages he enjoyed,
in con&s;equence of the recommendations of Mr. HUME. TURGOT,
QUESNAI, NECKER, d'ALEMBERT, HELVETIUS, MARMONTEL,
Madame RICCOBONI, were among the number of his acquaint|ances;
and &s;ome of them he continued ever afterwards to reckon
among his friends. From Madame d'ANVILLE, the re&s;pectable

<P>Mr. SMITH's la&s;t intercour&s;e with this excellent man was in the year 1789, when he informed him by means of a friend who happened to be then at Paris, that in the future editions of his <HI>Theory</HI> the name of ROCHEFOUCAULD &s;hould be no longer cla&s;&s;ed with that of MANDEVILLE. In the enlarged edition accordingly of that work, publi&s;hed a &s;hort time before his death, he has &s;uppre&s;&s;ed his cen&s;ure of the author of the <HI>Max|imes.</HI> who &s;eems indeed (however exceptionable many of his principles may be) to have been actuated, both in his life and writings, by motives very different from tho&s;e of MANDEVILLE. The real &s;cope of the&s;e maxims is placed, I think, in a ju&s;t light by the ingenious author of the <HI>notice</HI> prefixed to the edition of them publi&s;hed at Paris in 1778.</P></NOTE>, he received many attentions, which he always recol|lected
with particular gratitude.</P>
<P><PB N="lv" REF="54">
It is much to be regretted, that he pre&s;erved no journal of this
very intere&s;ting period of his hi&s;tory; and &s;uch was his aver&s;ion
<PB N="lvi" REF="55">
to write-letters, that I &s;carcely &s;uppo&s;e any memorial of it exi&s;ts in
his corre&s;pondence with his friends. The extent and accuracy of
his memory, in which he was equalled by few, made it of little con|fequence
to him&s;elf to record in writing what he heard or &s;aw; and
from his anxiety before his death to de&s;troy all the papers in his
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he &s;eems to have wi&s;hed, that no materials &s;hould remain
for his biographers, but what were &s;urni&s;hed by the lafting monu|ments
of his genius, and the exemplary worth of his private life.</P>
<P>The &s;atisfaction he enjoyed in the conver&s;ation of TURGOT may
be ea&s;ily imagined. Their opinions on the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential points of
political oeconomy were the &s;ame; and they were both animated by
the &s;ame zeal for the be&s;t intere&s;ts of mankind. The favourite
&s;tudies, too, of both had directed their enquiries to &s;ubjects on which
the under&s;tandings of the able&s;t and the be&s;t informed are liable to be
warped, to a great degree, by prejudice and pa&s;&s;ion; and on which,
of con&s;equence, a coincidence of judgment is peculiarly gratifying.
We are told by one of the biographers of TURGOT, that after his re|treat
from the mini&s;try, he occupied his lei&s;ure in a philo&s;ophical
corre&s;pondence with &s;ome of his old friends; and, in particular, that
various letters on important &s;ubjects pa&s;&s;ed between him and Mr.
SMITH. I take notice of this anecdote chiefly as a proof of the
intimacy which was under&s;tood to have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them;
for in other re&s;pects, the anecdote &s;eems to me to be &s;omewhat
doubtful. It is &s;carcely to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that Mr. SMITH would de|&s;troy
the letters of &s;uch a corre&s;pondent as TURGOT; and &s;till le&s;s
probable, that &s;uch an intercour&s;e was carried on between them with|out
the knowledge of any of Mr. SMITH's friends. From &s;ome
<PB N="lvii" REF="56">
enquiries that have been made at Paris by a gentleman of this Society
&s;ince M. SMITH'S death, I have rea&s;on to believe, that no evidence
of the corre&s;pondence exi&s;ts among the papers of M. TURGOT, and
that the whole &s;tory has taken its ri&s;e from a report &s;ugge&s;ted by the
knowledge of their former intimacy. This circum&s;tance I think it
of importance to mention, becau&s;e a good deal of curio&s;ity has
been excited by the pa&s;&s;age in que&s;tion, with re&s;pect to the fate
of the &s;uppo&s;ed letters.</P>
<P>Mr. SMITH was al&s;o well known to M. QUESNAI, the profound
and original author of the Oeconomical Table; a man (according to
Mr. SMITH'S account of him) &startq;of the greate&s;t mode&s;ty and &s;im|plicity;&endq;
and who&s;e &s;y&s;tem of political oeconomy he has pro|nounced,
&startq;with all its imperfections,&endq; to be &startq;the neare&s;t approxi|mation
to the truth that has yet been publi&s;hed on the principles
of that very important &s;cience.&endq; If he had not been prevented by
QUESNAI'S death, Mr. SMITH had once an intention (as he told me
him&s;elf) to have in&s;cribed to him his &startq;Wealth of Nations.&endq;</P>
<P>It was not, however, merely the di&s;tingui&s;hed men who about this
period fixed &s;o &s;plendid an aera in the literary hi&s;tory of France, that
excited Mr. SMITH'S curio&s;ity while he remained in Paris. His ac|quaintance
with the polite literature both of ancient and modern
times was exten&s;ve; and amid&s;t his various other occupations, he
had never neglected to cultivate a ta&s;te for the fine arts;&mdash;le&s;s, it is
probable, with a view to the peculiar enjoyments they convey,
(though he was by no means without &s;en&s;ibility to their beauties,)
than on account of their connection with the general principles of
the human mind; to an examination of which they afford the mo&s;t
plea&s;ing of all avenues. To tho&s;e who &s;peculate on this very deli|cate
&s;ubject, a compari&s;on of the modes of ta&s;te that prevail among
different nations, affords a valuable collection of facts; and Mr.
<PB N="lviii" REF="57">
SMITH, who was always di&s;po&s;ed to a&s;cribe to cu&s;tom and fa&s;hion
their full &s;are in regulating the opinions of mankind with re&s;pect
to beauty, may naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed to have availed him&s;elf of every
opportunity which a foreign country afforded him of illu&s;trating his
former theories.</P>
<P>Some of his peculiar notions, too, with re&s;pect to the imitative arts,
feem to have been much confirmed by his ob&s;ervations while abroad.
In accounting for the plea&s;ure we receive from the&s;e arts, it had early
occurred to him as a fundamental principle, that a very great part of
it ari&s;es from the difficulty of the imitation; a principle which was
probably &s;ugge&s;ted to him by that of the <HI>difficult&eacute; &s;urmont&eacute;e,</HI> by which
&s;ome French critics had attempted to explain the effect of ver&s;i&s;ica|tion
and of rhyme<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See the Preface to VOLTAIRE'S <HI>Oedipe,</HI> Edit. of 1729.</NOTE>. This principle Mr. SMITH pu&s;hed to the greate&s;t
po&s;&s;ible length, and referred to it, with &s;ingular ingenuity, a great va|riety
of phenomena in all the different fine arts. It led him, however,
to &s;ome conclu&s;ions, which appear, at fir&s;t view at lea&s;t, not a little
paradoxical; and I cannot help thinking, that it warped his judgment
in many of the opinions which he was accu&s;tomed to give on the
&s;ubject of poetry.</P>
<P>The principles of dramatic compo&s;ition had more particularly
attracted his attention; and the hi&s;tory of the theatre, both in an|cient
and modern times, had furni&s;hed him with &s;ome of the mo&s;t
remarkable facts on which his theory of the imitative arts was
founded. From this theory it &s;eemed to follow as a con&s;equence,
that the &s;ame circum&s;tances which, in tragedy, give to blank ver&s;e an
advantage over pro&s;e, &s;hould give to rhyme an advantage over blank
ver&s;e; and Mr. SMITH had always inclined to that opinion. Nay,
be had gone &s;o far as to extend the &s;ame doctrine to comedy; and
<PB N="lix" REF="58">
to regret that tho&s;e excellent pictures of life and manners which the
Engli&s;h &s;tage affords, had not been executed after the model of the
French &s;chool. The admiration with which he regarded the great
dramatic authors of France tended to con&s;irm him in the&s;e opinions;
and this admiration (re&s;ulting originally from the general character
of his ta&s;te, which delighted more to remark that pliancy of genius
which accommodates it&s;elf to e&s;tabli&s;hed rules, than to wonder at the
bolder flights of an undi&s;ciplined imagination) was increa&s;ed to a
great degree, when he &s;aw the beauties that had &s;truck him in the
clo&s;et, heightened by the utmo&s;t perfection of theatrical exhibition.
In the la&s;t years of his life, he &s;ometimes amu&s;ed him&s;elf, at a lei&s;ure
hour, in &s;upporting his theoretical conclu&s;ions on the&s;e &s;ubjects, by
the facts which his &s;ub&s;equent &s;tudies and ob&s;ervations had &s;ug|ge&s;ted;
and he intended, if he had lived, to have prepared the re|&s;ult
of the&s;e labours for the pre&s;s. Of this work he has left for
publication a &s;hort fragment; but he had not proceeded far enough
to apply his doctrine to ver&s;i&s;ication and to the theatre. As his no|tions,
however, with re&s;pect to the&s;e were a favourite topic of his
conver&s;ation, and were intimately connected with his general princi|ples
of critici&s;m, it would have been improper to pa&s;s them over in
this &s;ketch of his life; and I even thought it proper to detail them
at greater length than the comparative importance of the &s;ubject
would have ju&s;tified, if he had carried his plans into execution.
Whether his love of &s;y&s;tem, added to his partiality for the French
drama, may not have led him, in this in&s;tance, to generalize a little
too much his conclu&s;ions, and to overlook &s;ome peculiarities in the
language and ver&s;ification of that country, I &s;hall not take upon me
to determine.</P>
<P>In October 1766, the Duke of BUCCLEUGH returned to London.
His Grace, to whom I am indebted for &s;everal particulars in the
<PB N="lx" REF="59">
foregoing narrative, will, I hope, forgive the liberty I take in tran|&s;cribing
one paragraph in his own words: &startq;In October 1766, we
returned to London, after having &s;pent near three years together,
without the &s;lighte&s;t di&s;agreement or coolne&s;s;&mdash;on my part, with
every advantage that could be expected from the &s;ociety of &s;uch
a man. We continued to live in friend&s;hip till the hour of his
death; and I &s;hall always remain with the impre&s;&s;ion of having
lo&s;t a friend whom I loved and re&s;pected, not only for his great
talents, but for every private virtue.&endq;</P>
<P>The retirement in which Mr. SMITH pa&s;&s;ed his next ten years,
formed a &s;triking contra&s;t to the un&s;ettled mode of life he had been
for &s;ome time accu&s;tomed to, but was &s;o congenial to his natural
di&s;po&s;ition, and to his fir&s;&s;t habits, that it was with the utmo&s;t diffi|culty
he was ever per&s;uaded to leave it. During the whole of this
period, (with the exception of a few vi&s;its to Edinburgh and Lon|don,)
he remained with his mother at Kirkaldy; occupied habitually
in inten&s;e &s;ludy, but unbending his mind at times in the company
of &s;ome of his old &s;chool-fellows, who&s;e &startq;&s;ober wi&s;hes&endq; had at|tached
them to the place of their birth. In the &s;ociety of &s;uch men,
Mr. SMITH delighted; and to them he was endeared, not only by
his &s;imple and una&s;&s;uming manners, but by the perfect knowledge
they all po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of tho&s;e dome&s;tic virtues which had di&s;tingui&s;hed
him from his infancy.</P>
<P>Mr. HUME, who (as he tells us him&s;elf) con&s;idered &startq;a town as
the true &s;cene for a man of letters,&endq; made many attempts to &s;e|duce
him from his retirement. In a letter, dated in 1772, he urges
him to pa&s;s &s;ome time with him in Edinburgh. &startq;I &s;hall not take
any excu&s;e from your &s;tate of health, which I &s;uppo&s;e only a
&s;ubterfuge invented by indolence and love of &s;olitude. Indeed,
my dear SMITH, if you continue to hearken to complaints of this
<PB N="lxi" REF="60">
nature, you will cut your&s;elf out entirely from human &s;ociety, to the
great lo&s;s of both parties.&endq; In another letter, dated in 1769,
from his hou&s;e in James's Court, (which commanded a pro&s;pect of
the frith of Forth, and of the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t of Fife,) &startq;I am glad
(&s;ays he) to have come within &s;ight of you; but as I would al&s;o be
within &s;peaking terms of you, I wi&s;h we could concert mea&s;ures
for that purpo&s;e. I am mortally &s;ick at &s;ea, and regard with
horror and a kind of hydrophobia the great gulph that lies be|tween
us. I am al&s;o tired of travelling, as much as you ought
naturally to be of &s;taying at home. I therefore propo&s;e to you
to come hither, and pa&s;s &s;ome days with me in this &s;olitude. I
want to know what you have been doing, and propo&s;e to exact a
rigorous account of the method in which you have employed
your&s;elf during your retreat. I am po&s;itive you are in the wrong
in many of your &s;peculations, e&s;pecially where you have the mi&s;|fortune
to differ from me. All the&s;e are rea&s;ons for our meeting,
and I wi&s;h you would make me &s;ome rea&s;onable propo&s;al for that
purpo&s;e. There is no habitation in the i&s;land of Inchkeith, other|wi&s;e
I &s;hould challenge you to meet me on that &s;pot, and neither
of us ever to leave the place, till we were fully agreed on all points
of controver&s;y. I expect General CONWAY here to-morrow,
whom I &s;hall attend to Ro&s;eneath, and I &s;hall remain there a few
days. On my return, I hope to find a letter from you, contain|ing
a bold acceptance of this defiance.&endq;</P>
<P>At length (in the beginning of the year 1776) Mr. SMITH ac|counted
to the world for his long retreat, by the publication of his
&startq;Inquiry into the Nature and Cau&s;es of the Wealth of Nations.&endq;
A letter of congratulation on this event, from Mr. HUME, is now
before me. It is dated I &s;t April 1776, (about &s;ix months before
Mr. HUME'S death,) and di&s;covers an amiable &s;olicitude about his
<PB N="lxii" REF="61">
friend's literary fame. &startq;<HI>Euge! Belle!</HI> Dear Mr. SMITH: I am much
plea&s;ed with your performance, and the peru&s;al of it has taken
me from a &s;tate of great anxiety. It was a work of &s;o much
expectation, by your&s;elf, by your friends, and by the public,
that I trembled for its appearance; but am now much relieved.
Not but that the reading of it nece&s;&s;arily requires &s;o much attention,
and the public is di&s;po&s;ed to give &s;o little, that I &s;hall &s;till doubt
for &s;ome time of its being at fir&s;t very popular. But it has depth
and &s;olidity and acutene&s;s, and is &s;o much ill&s;trated by curious
facts, that it mu&s;t at la&s;t take the public attention. It is probably
much improved by your l&s;st abode in London. If you were here
at my fire-&s;ide, I &s;hould di&s;pute &s;ome of your principles......
............ But the&s;e, and a hundred other points,
are &s;it only to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in conver&s;ation. I hope it will be &s;oon;
for I am in a very bad &s;tate of health, and cannot a&s;&s;ord a long
delay.&endq;</P>
<P>Of a book which is now &s;o univer&s;ally known as &startq;The Wealth
of Nations,&endq; it might be con&s;idered perhaps as &s;uper&s;luous to
give a particular analy&s;is; and at any rate, the limits of this e&s;&s;ay
make it impo&s;&s;ible for me to attempt it at pre&s;ent. A few remarks,
however, on the object and tendency of the work, may, I hope, be
introduced without impropriety. The hi&s;tory of a Philo&s;opher's life
can contain little more than the hi&s;tory of his &s;peculations; and in
the ca&s;e of &s;uch an author as Mr. SMITH, who&s;e &s;tudies were &s;y&s;te|matically
directed from his youth to &s;ubjects of the la&s;t importance
to human happine&s;s, a review of his writings, while it &s;erves to illu&s;|trate
the peculiarities of his genius, affords the mo&s;t faithful picture
of his character as a man.</P>

Nations<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The length to which this Memoir has already extended, together with &s;ome other rea&s;ons which it is unnece&s;&s;ary to mention here, have induced me, in printing the following &s;ection, to confine my&s;elf to a much more general view of the &s;ubject than I once intended.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>AN hi&s;torical review of the different forms under which human
affairs have appeared in different ages and nations, naturally
&s;ugge&s;ts the que&s;tion, Whether the experience of former times may
not now furni&s;h &s;ome general principles to enlighten and direct the
policy of future legi&s;lators? The di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, however, to which
this que&s;tion leads is of &s;ingular difficulty; as it requires an accu|rate
analy&s;is of by far the mo&s;t complicated cla&s;s of phaenomena
that can po&s;&s;ibly engage our attention, tho&s;e which re&s;ult from
the intricate and often the imperceptible mechani&s;m of political &s;o|ciety;&mdash;a
&s;ubject of ob&s;ervation which &s;eems, at fir&s;t view, &s;o
little commen&s;urate to our faculties, that it has been generally re|garded
with the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ive emotions of wonder and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion,
with which, in the material world, we &s;urvey the effects produced,
by the my&s;terious and uncontroulable operation of phy&s;ical cau&s;es.
It is fortunate that upon this, as on many other occa&s;ions, the diffi|culties
which had long baffled the efforts of &s;olitary genius begin
to appear le&s;s formidable to the united exertions of the race; and
that in proportion as the experience and the rea&s;onings of different
individuals are brought to bear upon the &s;ame objects, and are com|bined
in &s;uch a manner as to illu&s;trate and to limit each other, the
<PB N="lxiv" REF="63">
&s;cience of politics a&s;&s;umes more and more that &s;y&s;tematical form
which encourages and aids the labours of future enquirers.</P>
<P>In pro&s;ecuting the &s;cience of politics on this plan, little a&s;&s;i&s;tance is
to be derived from the &s;peculations of ancient philo&s;ophers, the
greater part of whom, in their political enquiries, con&s;ined their
attention to a compari&s;on of different forms of government, and to
an examination of the provi&s;ions they made for perpetuating their
own exi&s;tence, and for extending the glory of the &s;tate. It was
re&s;erved for modern times to inve&s;tigate tho&s;e univer&s;al principles of
ju&s;tice and of expediency, which ought, under every form of go|vernment,
to regulate the &s;ocial order; and of which the object is,
to make as equitable a di&s;tribution as po&s;&s;ible, among all the different
members of a community, of the advantages ari&s;ing from the political
union.</P>
<P>The invention of printing was perhaps nece&s;&s;ary to prepare the way
for the&s;e re&s;earches. In tho&s;e departments of literature and of
&s;cience, where genius finds within it&s;elf the materials of its labours; in
poetry, in pure geometry, and in &s;ome branches of moral philo&s;ophy;
the ancients have not only laid the foundations on which we are to
build, but have left great and fini&s;hed models for our imitation.
But in phy&s;ics, where our progre&s;s depends on an immen&s;e collec|tion
of facts, and on a combination of the accidental lights daily
&s;truck out in the innumerable walks of ob&s;ervation and experiment;
and in politics, where the materials of our theories are equally
&s;cattered, and are collected and arranged with &s;till greater diffi|culty,
the means of communication afforded by the pre&s;s have, in the
cour&s;e of two centuries, accelerated the progre&s;s of the human mind,
far beyond what the moft &s;anguine hopes of our predece&s;&s;ors could
have imagined.</P>
<P><PB N="lxv" REF="64">
The progre&s;s already made in this &s;cience, incon&s;iderable as it is
in compari&s;on of what may be yet expected, has been &s;ufficient to
&s;hew, that the happine&s;s of mankind depends, not on the &s;hare
which the people po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, directly or indirectly, in the enactment
of laws, but on the equity and expediency of the laws that are enacted.
The &s;hare which the people po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in the government is interesting
chiefly to the &s;mall number of men who&s;e object is the attainment of
political importance; but the equity and expediency of the laws are
interesting to every member of the community: and more e&s;pecially
to tho&s;e who&s;e per&s;onal in&s;ignificance leaves them no encouragement,
but what they derive from the general &s;pirit of the government under
which they live.</P>
<P>It is evident, therefore, that the mo&s;t important branch of politi|cal
&s;cience is that which has for its object to a&s;certain the philo&s;o|phical
principles of juri&s;prudence; or (as Mr. SMITH expre&s;&s;es it)
to a&s;certain &startq;the general principles which ought to run through and
be the foundation of the laws of all nations<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See the conclu&s;ion of his Theory of Moral Sentiments.</NOTE>.&endq; In countries,
where the prejudices of the people are widely at variance with the&s;e
principles, the political liberty which the con&s;titution beflows, only
furni&s;hes them with the means of accompli&s;hing their own ruin:
And if it were po&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e principles completely realized
in any &s;ystem of laws, the people would have little rea&s;on to com|plain,
that they were not immediately in&s;trumental in their enact|ment.
The only infallible criterion of the excellence of any con|&s;titution
is to be found in the detail of its municipal code; and the
value which wi&s;e men &s;et on political freedom, ari&s;es chiefly from
the facility it is &s;uppo&s;ed to afford, for the introduction of tho&s;e le|gi&s;lative
improvements which the general intere&s;ts of the community
<PB N="xlvi" REF="65">
recommend.&mdash;I cannot help adding, that the capacity of a people to
exerci&s;e political rights with utility to them&s;elves and to their coun|try,
pre&s;uppo&s;es a diffu&s;ion of knowledge and of good morals,
which can only re&s;ult from the previous operation of laws favourable
to indu&s;try, to order, and to freedom.</P>
<P>Of the truth of the&s;e remarks, enlightened politicians &s;eem now to
be in general convinced; for the mo&s;t celebrated works which have
been produced in the different countries of Europe, during the la&s;t
thirty years, by SMITH, QUESNAI, TURGOT, CAMPOMANES, BEC|CARIA,
and others, have aimed at the improvement of &s;ociety,&mdash;not
by dclineating plans of new con&s;titutions, but by enlightening the
policy of actual legi&s;lators. Such &s;peculations, while they are more
e&s;&s;entially and more exten&s;ively u&s;eful than any others, have no ten|dency
to unhinge e&s;tabli&s;hed in&s;titutions, or to in&s;lame the pa&s;&s;ions of
the multitude. The improvements they recommend are to be effected
by means too gradual and &s;low in their operation, to warm the ima|ginations
of any but of the &s;peculative few; and in proportion as they
are adopted, they con&s;olidate the political fabric, and enlarge the ba&s;is
upon which it re&s;ts.</P>
<P>To direct the policy of nations with re&s;pect to one mo&s;t impor|tant
cla&s;s of its laws, tho&s;e which form its &s;y&s;tem of political oeco|nomy,
is the great aim of Mr. SMITH's <HI>Inquiry:</HI> And he has un|que&s;tionably
had the merit of pre&s;enting to the world, the mo&s;t com|prehen&s;ive
and perfect work that has yet appeared, on the general
principles of any branch of legi&s;lation. The example which he has
&s;et will be followed, it is to be hoped, in due time, by other writers,
for whom the internal policy of &s;tates furni&s;hes many other &s;ubjects
of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion no le&s;s curious and intere&s;ting; and may accelerate the
progre&s;s of that &s;cience which Lord BACON has &s;o well de&s;cribed in
<PB N="lxvii" REF="66">
the following pa&s;&s;age: &startq;Finis et &s;copus quem leges intueri, atque
ad quem ju&s;&s;iones et &s;anctiones &s;uas dirigere debent, non alius e&s;t,
quam ut cives feliciter degant: id fiet, &s;i pietate et religione recte
in&s;tituti; moribus hone&s;ti; armis adver&s;us ho&s;tes externos tuti;

formae diver&s;ae: ideoque po&s;&s;int de legibus, ex prin|cipiis

Quamobrem id nunc agatur, ut fontes ju&s;titiae et utilitatis

et idea ju&s;ti exhibeatur, ad quam particularium regnorum et
rerumpublicarum leges probare, atque inde emendationem moliri,
qui&s;que, cui hoc cordi erit et curae, po&s;&s;it.&endq; The enumeration
contained in the foregoing pa&s;&s;age, of the different objects of law,
coincides very nearly with that given by Mr. SMITH in the conclu|&s;ion
of his Theory of Moral Sentiments; and the preci&s;e aim of
the political &s;peculations which he then announced, and of which he
afterwards publi&s;hed &s;o valuable a part in his Wealth of Nations,
was to a&s;certain the general principles of ju&s;tice and of expediency,
which ought to guide the in&s;titutions of legi&s;lators on the&s;e impor|tant
articles;&mdash;in the words of Lord BACON, to a&s;certain tho&s;e <HI>leges
legum,</HI> &startq;ex quibus informatio peti po&s;&s;it, quid in &s;ingulis legibus
bene aut perperam po&s;itum aut con&s;titutum &s;it.&endq;</P>
<P>The branch of legi&s;lation which Mr. SMITH has made choice of
as the &s;ubject of his work, naturally leads me to remark a very
&s;triking contra&s;t between the &s;pirit of ancient and of modern policy
<PB N="lxviii" REF="67">
in re&s;pect to the Wealth of Nations<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Science de la Legi&s;lation, par le Chev. FILANGIERI, Liv. i. chap. 13.</NOTE>. The great object of the
&s;ormer was to counteract the love of money and a ta&s;te for luxury,
by po&s;itive in&s;titutions; and to maintain in the great body of the
people, habits of frugality, and a &s;everity of manners. The decline
of &s;tates is uniformly a&s;cribed by the philo&s;ophers and hi&s;torians,
both of Greece and Rome, to the influence of riches on national
character; and the laws of LYCURGUS, which, during a cour&s;e of
ages, bani&s;hed the precious metals from Sparta, are propo&s;ed by
many of them as the mo&s;t perfect model of legi&s;lation devi&s;ed by
human wi&s;dom.&mdash;How oppo&s;ite to this is the doctrine of modern
politicians! Far from con&s;idering poverty as an advantage to a &s;tate,
their great aim is to open new &s;ources of national opulence, and to
animate the activity of all cla&s;&s;es of the people by a ta&s;te for the com|forts
and accommodations of life.</P>
<P>One principal cau&s;e of this difference between the &s;pirit of ancient
and of modern policy, may be found in the difference between the
&s;ources of national wealth in ancient and in modern times. In
ages when commerce and manufactures were yet in their infancy,
and among &s;tates con&s;tituted like mo&s;t of the ancient republics, a
&s;udden influx of riches from abroad was ju&s;tly dreaded as an evil,
alarming to the morals, to the indu&s;try, and to the freedom of a
people. So different, however, is the ca&s;e at pre&s;ent, that the mo&s;t
wealthy nations are tho&s;e where the people are the mo&s;t laborious,
and where they enjoy the greate&s;t degree of liberty. Nay, it was
the general diffu&s;ion of wealth among the lower orders of men,
which fir&s;t gave birth to the &s;pirit of independence in modern
Europe, and which has produced under &s;ome of its governments,
<PB N="lxix" REF="68">
and e&s;pecially under our own, a more equal diffu&s;ion of freedom and
of happine&s;s than took place under the mo&s;t celebrated con&s;titutions
of antiquity.</P>
<P>Without this diffu&s;ion of wealth among the lower orders, the
important effects re&s;ulting from the invention of printing would have
been extremely limited; for a certain degree of ca&s;e and independ|ence
is nece&s;&s;ary to in&s;pire men with the de&s;ire of knowledge, and
to afford them the lei&s;ure which is requi&s;ite for acquiring it; and it
is only by the rewards which &s;uch a &s;tate of &s;ociety holds up to in|du&s;try
and ambition, that the &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ions of the multitude can be
intere&s;ted in the intellectual improvement of their children. The
exten&s;ive propagation of light and re&s;inement ari&s;ing from the influ|ence
of the pre&s;s, aided by the &s;pirit of commerce, &s;eems to be the
remedy provided by nature, again&s;t the fatal effects which would
otherwi&s;e be produced, by the &s;ubdivi&s;ion of labour accompanying
the progre&s;s of the mechanical arts: Nor is any thing wanting to
make the remedy effectual, but wi&s;e in&s;titutions to facilitate ge|neral
in&s;truction, and to adapt the education of individuals to the
&s;tations they are to occupy. The mind of the arti&s;t, which, from
the limited &s;phere of his activity, would &s;ink below the level of the
pea&s;ant or the &s;avage, might receive in infancy the means of intel|lectual
enjoyment, and the &s;eeds of moral improvement; and even
the in&s;ipid uniformity of his profe&s;&s;ional engagements, by pre&s;ent|ing
no object to awaken his ingenuity or to di&s;tract his attention
might leave him at liberty to employ his faculties, on &s;ubjects more
intere&s;ting to him&s;elf, and more exten&s;ively u&s;eful to others.</P>
<P>The&s;e effects, notwith&s;tanding a variety of oppo&s;ing cau&s;es which
&s;till exi&s;t, have already re&s;ulted, in a very &s;en&s;ible degree, from the
<PB N="lxx" REF="69">
liberal policy of modern times. Mr. HUME, in his E&s;&s;ay on Com|merce,
after taking notice of the numerous armies rai&s;ed and main|tained
by the &s;mall republics in the ancient world, a&s;cribes the mi|litary
power of the&s;e &s;tates to their want of commerce and luxury.
&startq;Few arti&s;ans were maintained by the labour of the farmers, and
therefore more &s;oldiers might live upon it.&endq; He adds, however,
that &startq;the policy of ancient times was VIOLENT, and contrary to the
NATURAL cour&s;e of things;&endq;&mdash;by which, I pre&s;ume, he means,
that it aimed too much at modifying, by the force of po&s;itive in&s;ti|tutions,
the order of &s;ociety, according to &s;ome preconceived idea of
expediency; without tru&s;ting &s;ufficiently to tho&s;e principles of the
human con&s;titution, which, wherever they are allowed free &s;cope,
not only conduct mankind to happine&s;s, but lay the foundation of
a progre&s;&s;ive improvement in their condition and in their character.
The advantages which modern policy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es over the ancient, ari&s;e
principally from its conformity, in &s;ome of the mo&s;t important ar|ticles
of political ceconomy, to an order of things recommended by
nature; and it would not be difficult to &s;hew, that where it re|mains
imperfect, its errors may be traced to the re&s;traints it impo&s;es
on the natural cour&s;e of human affairs. Indeed, in the&s;e re&s;traints
may be di&s;covered the latent &s;eeds of many of the prejudices and
follies which infect modern manners, and which have &s;o long bid
defiance to the rea&s;onings of the philo&s;opher and the ridicule of the
&s;atiri&s;t.</P>
<P>The foregoing very imperfect hints appeared to me to form, not
only a proper, but in &s;ome mea&s;ure a nece&s;&s;ary introduction to the
few remarks I have to offer on Mr. SMITH's Inquiry; as they tend
to illu&s;trate a connection between his &s;y&s;tem of commercial politics,
and tho&s;e &s;peculations of his earlier years, in which he aimed more
<PB N="lxxi" REF="70">
profe&s;&s;edly at the advancement of human improvement and hap|pine&s;s.
It is this view of political oeconomy that can alone render
it intere&s;ting to the morali&s;t, and can dignify calculations of profit
and lo&s;s in the eye of the philo&s;opher. Mr. SMITH has alluded to
it in various pa&s;&s;ages of his work, but he has no where explained
him&s;elf fully on the &s;ubject; and the great &s;tre&s;s he has laid on
the effects of the divi&s;ion of labour in increa&s;ing its productive
powers &s;eems, at fir&s;t &s;ight, to point to a different and very melan|choly
conclu&s;ion;&mdash;that the &s;ame cau&s;es which promote the progre&s;s
of the arts, tend to degrade the mind of the arti&s;t; and, of con&s;e|quence,
that the growth of national wealth implies a &s;acri&s;ice of the
character of the people.</P>
<P>The fundamental doctrines of Mr. SMITH's &s;y&s;tem are now &s;o
generally known, that it would have been tedious to offer any reca|pitulation
of them in this place; even if I could have hoped to do
ju&s;tice to the &s;ubject, within the limits which I have pre&s;cribed to
my&s;elf at pre&s;ent. A di&s;tinct analy&s;is of his work might indeed be
u&s;eful to many readers; but it would it&s;elf form a volume of con&s;i|derable
magnitude. I may perhaps, at &s;ome future period, pre&s;ent
to the Society, an attempt towards &s;uch an analy&s;is, which I began
long ago, for my own &s;atisfaction, and which I lately made con&s;i|derable
progre&s;s in preparing for the pre&s;s, before I was aware of the
impo&s;&s;ibility of connecting it, with the general plan of this paper. In
the mean time, I &s;hall content my&s;elf with remarking, that the great
and leading object of Mr. SMITH's &s;peculations is to illu&s;trate the pro|vi&s;ion
made by nature in the principles of the human mind, and in
the circum&s;tances of man's external &s;ituation, for a gradual and pro|gre&s;&s;ive
augmentation in the means of national wealth; and to de|mon&s;trate,
that the mo&s;t effectual plan for advancing a people to
<PB N="lxxii" REF="71">
greatne&s;s, is to maintain that order of things which nature has point|ed
out; by allowing every man, as long as he ob&s;erves the rules of
ju&s;tice, to pur&s;ue his own intere&s;t in his own way, and to bring both
his indu&s;try and his capital into the freest competition with tho&s;e
of his fellow-citizens. Every &s;y&s;tem of policy which endeavours,
either by extraordinary encouragements, to draw towards a particu|lar
&s;pecies of indu&s;try a greater &s;hare of the capital of the &s;ociety
than what would naturally go to it; or, by extraordinary re&s;traints,
to force from a particular &s;pecies of indu&s;try &s;ome &s;hare of the capital
which would otherwi&s;e be employed in it, is, in reality, &s;ubver&s;ive
of the great purpo&s;e which it means to promote.</P>
<P>What the circum&s;tances are, which, in modern Europe, have
contributed to di&s;turb this order of nature, and, in particular, to en|courage
the indu&s;try of towns, at the expence of that of the coun|try,
Mr. SMITH has inve&s;tigated with great ingenuity; and in &s;uch
a manner, as to throw much new light on the hi&s;tory of that &s;tate of
&s;ociety which prevails in this quarter of the globe. His ob&s;ervations
on this &s;ubject tend to &s;hew, that the&s;e circum&s;tances were, in their
fir&s;t origin, the natural and the unavoidable re&s;ult of the peculiar
&s;ituation of mankind during a certain period; and that they took
their ri&s;e, not from any general &s;cheme of policy, but from the pri|vate
intere&s;ts and prejudices of particular orders of men.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of &s;ociety, however, which at fir&s;t aro&s;e from a &s;ingular
combination of accidents, has been prolonged much beyond its natu|ral
period, by a fal&s;e &s;y&s;tem of political ceconomy, propagated by
merchants and manufacturers; a cla&s;s of individuals, who&s;e intere&s;t
is not always the &s;ame with that of the public, and who&s;e profe&s;&s;ional
knowledge gave them many advantages, more particularly in the
<PB N="lxxiii" REF="72">
infancy of this branch of &s;cience, in defending tho&s;e opinions which
they wi&s;hed to encourage. By means of this &s;y&s;tem, a new &s;et of
ob&s;tacles to the progre&s;s of national pro&s;perity has been created.
Tho&s;e which aro&s;e from the di&s;orders of the feudal ages, tended direct|ly
to di&s;turb the internal arrangements of &s;ociety, by ob&s;tructing the
free circulation of labour and of &s;tock, from employment to employ|ment,
and from place to place. The fal&s;e &s;y&s;tem of political oeco|nomy
which has been hitherto prevalent, as its profe&s;&s;ed object has
been to regulate the commercial intercour&s;e between different nations,
has produced its effect in a way le&s;s direct and le&s;s manife&s;t, but
equally prejudicial to the &s;tates that have adopted it.</P>
<P>On this &s;y&s;tem, as it took its ri&s;e from the prejudices, or rather
from the intere&s;ted views of mercantile &s;peculators, Mr. SMITH
be&s;tows the title of the Commercial or Mercantile Sy&s;tem; and he
has con&s;idered at great length its two principal expedients for enrich|ing
a nation; reftraints upon importation, and encouragements to
exportation. Part of the&s;e expedients, he ob&s;erves, have been dic|tated
by the &s;pirit of monopoly, and part by a &s;pirit of jealou&s;y
again&s;t tho&s;e countries with which the balance of trade is &s;uppo&s;ed
to be di&s;advantageous. All of them appear clearly, from his rea&s;on|ings,
to have a tendency unfavourable to the wealth of the nation
which impo&s;es them.&mdash;His remarks with re&s;pect to the jealou&s;y of
commerce are expre&s;&s;ed in a tone of indignation, which he &s;eldom
a&s;&s;umes in his political writings.</P>
<P>&startq;In this manner (&s;ays he) the &s;neaking arts of underling trade&s;|men
are erected into political maxims for the conduct of a great
empire. By &s;uch maxims as the&s;e, nations have been taught that
their intere&s;t con&s;i&s;ted in beggaring all their neighbours. Each
<PB N="lxxiv" REF="73">
nation has been made to look with an invidious eye upon the
pro&s;perity of all the nations with which it trades, and to con&s;ider
their gain as its own lo&s;s. Commerce, which ought naturally to be
among nations as among individuals, a bond of union and friend|&s;hip,
has become the mo&s;t fertile &s;ource of di&s;cord and animo&s;ity.
The capricious ambition of Kings and Mini&s;ters has not, during
the pre&s;ent and the preceding century, been more fatal to the re|po&s;e
of Europe, than the impertinent jealou&s;y of merchants and
manufacturers. The violence and inju&s;tice of the rulers of man|kind
is an ancient evil, for which perhaps the nature of human
affairs can &s;carce admit of a remedy. But the mean rapacity, the
monopolizing &s;pirit of merchants and manufacturers, who neither
are nor ought to be the rulers of mankind, though it cannot per|haps
be corrected, may very ea&s;ily be prevented from di&s;turbing
the tranquillity of any body but themselves.&endq;</P>
<P>Such are the liberal principles which, according to Mr. SMITH,
ought to direct the commercial policy of nations; and of which it
ought to be the great object of legi&s;lators to facilitate the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment.
In what manner the execution of the theory &s;hould be con|ducted
in particular in&s;tances, is a que&s;tion of a very different na|ture,
and to which the an&s;wer mu&s;t vary, in different countries, ac|cording
to the different circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e. In a &s;peculative
work, &s;uch as Mr. SMITH's, the con&s;ideration of this que&s;tion did
not fall properly under his general plan; but that he was abundantly
aware of the danger to be apprehended from a ra&s;h application of po|litical
theories, appears not only from the general &s;train of his writ|ings,
but from &s;ome incidental ob&s;ervations which he has expre&s;sly
made upon the &s;ubject. &startq;So unfortunate (&s;ays he, in one pa&s;&s;age)
are the effects of all the regulations of the mercantile &s;y&s;tem, that
<PB N="lxxv" REF="74">
they not only introduce very dangerous di&s;orders into the &s;tate of
the body politic, but di&s;orders which it is often difficult to reme|dy,
without occa&s;ioning, for a time at lea&s;t, &s;till greater di&s;or|ders.&mdash;In
what manner, therefore, the natural &s;y&s;tem of perfect
liberty and ju&s;tice ought gradually to be re&s;tored, we mu&s;t leave to
the wi&s;dom of future &s;tate&s;men and legi&s;lators to determine.&endq; In
the laft edition of his Theory of Moral Sentiments, he has intro|duced
&s;ome remarks, which have an obvious reference to the &s;ame
important doctrine. The following pa&s;&s;age &s;eems to refer more par|ticularly
to tho&s;e derangements of the &s;ocial order which derived
their origin from the feudal in&s;titutions:</P>
<P>&startq;The man who&s;e public &s;pirit is prompted altogether by huma|nity
and benevolence, will re&s;pect the e&s;tabli&s;ed powers and pri|vileges
even of individuals, and &s;till more of the great orders and
&s;ocieties into which the &s;tate is divided. Though he &s;hould con|&s;ider
&s;ome of them as in &s;ome mea&s;ure abu&s;ive, he will content
him&s;elf with moderating, what he often cannot annihilate with|out
great violence. When he cannot conquer the rooted preju|dices
of the people by rea&s;on and per&s;ua&s;ion, he will not attempt
to &s;ubdue them by force; but will religioufly ob&s;erve what, by
CICERO, is ju&s;tly called the divine maxim of PLATO, never to
u&s;e violence to his country no more than to his parents. He will
accommodate, as well as he can, his public arrangements to the
confirmed habits and prejudices of the people; and will remedy,
as well as he can, the inconveniencies which may flow from the
want of tho&s;e regulations which the people are aver&s;e to &s;ubmit to.
When he cannot e&s;tabli&s;h the right, he will not di&s;dain t$$ame|liorate
the wrong; but like SOLON, when he cannot e&s;tabli&s;h
<PB N="lxxvi" REF="75">
the be&s;t &s;y&s;tem of laws, he will endeavour to e&s;tabli&s;h the be&s;t
that the people can bear.&endq;</P>
<P>The&s;e cautions with re&s;pect to the practical application of general
principles were peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary from the Author of &startq;The
Wealth of Nations;&endq; as the unlimited freedom of trade, which it
is the chief aim of his work to recommend, is extremely apt, by
flattering the indolence of the &s;tate&s;man, to &s;ugge&s;t to tho&s;e who
are inve&s;ted with ab&s;olute power, the idea of carrying it into im|mediate
execution. &startq;Nothing is more adver&s;e to the tranquillity of
a &s;tate&s;man (&s;ays the author of an Eloge on the Admini&s;tration of
COLBERT) than a &s;pirit of moderation; becau&s;e it condemns him
to perpetual ob&s;ervation, &s;hews him every moment the in&s;uffici|ency
of his wi&s;dom, and leaves him the melancholy &s;en&s;e of his
own imperfection; while, under the &s;helter of a few general prin|ciples,
a &s;y&s;tematical politician enjoys a perpetual calm. By the
help of one alone, that of a perfect liberty of trade, he would
govern the world, and would leave human affairs to arrange them|&s;lves
at plea&s;ure, under the operation of the prejudices and the
&s;elf-intere&s;t of individuals. If the&s;e run counter to each other, he
gives him&s;elf no anxiety about the con&s;equence; he in&s;i&s;ts that
the re&s;ult cannot be judged of till after a century or two &s;hall have
elap&s;ed. If his contemporaries, in con&s;equence of the di&s;order
into which he has thrown public affairs, are &s;crupulous about &s;ub|mitting
quietly to the experiment, he accu&s;es them of impatience.
They alone, and not he, are to blame for what they have &s;uffered;
and the principle continues to be inculcated with the &s;ame zeal and
the &s;ame confidence as before.&endq; The&s;e are the words of the in|genious
and eloquent author of the Eloge on GOLBERT, which ob|tained
<PB N="lxxvii" REF="76">
the prize from the French Academy in the year 1763; a per|formance
which, although confined and erroneous in its &s;peculative
views, abounds with ju&s;t and important reflections of a practical
nature. How far his remarks apply to that particular cla&s;s of poli|ticians
whom he had evidently in his eye in the foregoing pa&s;&s;age, I
&s;hall not pre&s;ume to decide.</P>
<P>It is hardly nece&s;&s;ary for me to add to the&s;e ob&s;ervations, that they
do not detract in the lea&s;t from the value of tho&s;e political theo|ries
which attempt to delineate the principles of a perfect legi&s;lation.
Such theories (as I have el&s;ewhere ob&s;erved<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Elements of the Philo&s;ophy of the Human Mind, p. 261.</NOTE>) ought to be con&s;idered
merely as de&s;criptions of the <HI>ultimate</HI> objects at which the &s;tate&s;man
ought to aim. The tranquillity of his admini&s;tration, and the imme|diate
&s;ucce&s;s of his mea&s;ures, depend on his good &s;en&s;e and his prac|tical
&s;kill; and his theoretical principles only enable him to direct
his mea&s;ures &s;teadily and wi&s;ely, to promote the improvement and
happine&s;s of mankind, and prevent him from being ever led a&s;tray
from the&s;e important ends, by more limited views of tempo|rary
expedience. &startq;In all ca&s;es (&s;ays Mr. HUME) it mu&s;t be ad|vantageous
to know what is mo&s;t perfect in the kind, that we may
be able to bring any real con&s;titution or form of government as
near it as po&s;&s;ible, by &s;uch gentle alterations and innovations as
may not give too great di&s;turbance to &s;ociety.&endq;</P>
<P>The limits of this Memoir make it impo&s;&s;ible for me to examine
particularly the merit of Mr. SMITH's work in point of originality.
That his doctrine concerning the freedom of trade and of indu&s;try
coincides remarkably with that which we find in the writings of the
French Oeconomi&s;ts, appears from the &s;light view of their &s;y&s;tem
<PB N="lxxviii" REF="77">
which he him&s;elf has given. But it &s;urely cannot be pretended by
the warme&s;t admirers of that &s;y&s;tem, that any one of its numerous
expo&s;itors has approached to Mr. SMITH in the preci&s;ion and per&s;pi|cuity
with which he has &s;tated it, or in the &s;cienti&s;ic and luminous
manner in which he has deduced it from elementary principles. The
awkwardne&s;s of their technical language, and the paradoxical form
in which they have cho&s;en to pre&s;ent &s;ome of their opinions, are ac|knowledged
even by tho&s;e who are mo&s;t willing to do ju&s;tice to their
merits; whereas it may be doubted with re&s;pect to Mr. SMITH's
Inquiry, if there exi&s;ts any book beyond the circle of the mathema|tical
and phy&s;ical &s;ciences, which is at once &s;o agreeable in its ar|rangement
to the rules of a &s;ound logic, and &s;o acce&s;&s;ible to the ex|amination
of ordinary readers. Ab&s;tracting entirely from the au|thor's
peculiar and original &s;peculations, I do not know, that upon
any &s;ubject whatever, a work has been produced in our times, con|taining
&s;o methodical, &s;o comprehen&s;ive, and &s;o judicious a dige&s;t of
all the mo&s;t profound and enlightened philo&s;ophy of the age.</P>
<P>In ju&s;tice al&s;o to Mr. SMITH, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that although
&s;ome of the oeconomical writers had the &s;tart of him in publi&s;hing
their doctrines to the world, the&s;e doctrines appear, with re&s;pect to
him, to have been altogether original, and the re&s;ult of his own re|flections.
Of this, I think, every per&s;on mu&s;t be convinced, who
reads the Inquiry with due attention, and is at pains to examine the
gradual and beautiful progre&s;&s; of the author's ideas: But in ca&s;e any
doubt &s;hould remain on this head, it may be proper to mention, that
Mr. SMITH's political lectures, comprehending the fundamental
principles of his Inquiry, were delivered at Gla&s;gow as early as the
year 1752 or 1753; at a period, &s;urely, when there exi&s;ted no
French performance on the &s;ubject, that could be of much u&s;e to
<PB N="lxxix" REF="78">
him in guiding his re&s;earches<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In proof of this, it is &s;ufficient for me to appeal to a &s;hort hi&s;tory of the progre&s;s of political oeconomy in France, publi&s;hed in one of the volumes of <HI>Ephemerides du Citoyen.</HI> See the fir&s;t part of the volume for the year 1769. The paper is entitled, <HI>Notice abr&eacute;g&eacute;e des diff&eacute;rens Ecrits modernes, qui ont concouru en France &agrave; former la &s;cience de P&eacute;conomie politique.</HI></NOTE>. In the year 1756, indeed, M.
TURGOT (who is &s;aid to have imbibed his fir&s;t notions concerning
the unlimited freedom of commerce from an old merchant, M.
GOURNAY) publi&s;hed in the <HI>Encyclopedie,</HI> an article which &s;ufficiently
&s;hews how completely his mind was emancipated from the old pre|judices
in favour of commercial regulations: But that even then,
the&s;e opinions were confined to a few &s;peculative men in France,
appears from a pa&s;&s;age in the <HI>M&eacute;moires &s;ur la Vie et les Ouvrages de</HI>
M. TURGOT; in which, after a &s;hort quotation from the article ju&s;t
mentioned, the author adds: &startq;The&s;e ideas were <HI>then</HI> con&s;idered as
paradoxical; they are &s;ince become common, and they will one
day be adopted univer&s;ally.&endq;</P>
<P>The Political Di&s;cour&s;es of Mr. HUME were evidently of greater
u&s;e to Mr. SMITH, than any other book that had appeared prior to
his lectures. Even Mr. HUME's theories, however, though always
plau&s;ible and ingenious, and in mo&s;t in&s;tances profound and ju&s;t, in|volve
&s;ome fundamental mi&s;takes; and, when compared with Mr.
SMITH's, afford a &s;triking proof, that, in con&s;idering a &s;ubject &s;o
exten&s;ive and &s;o complicated, the mo&s;t penetrating &s;agacity, if di|rected
only to particular que&s;tions, is apt to be led a&s;tray by fir&s;t
appearances; and that nothing can guard us effectually again&s;t error,
but a comprehen&s;ive &s;urvey of the whole field of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, a&s;&s;i&s;ted
by an accurate and patient analy&s;is of the ideas about which our
rea&s;onings are employed.&mdash;It may be worth while to add, that Mr.
HUME'S E&s;&s;ay &startq;on the Jealou&s;y of Trade,&endq; with &s;ome other of his
Political Di&s;cour&s;es, received a very flattering proof of M. TURGOT's
<PB N="lxxx" REF="79">
approbation, by his undertaking the ta&s;k of tran&s;lating them into the
French language.</P>
<P>I am aware that the evidence I have hitherto produced of
Mr. SMITH's originality may be objected to as not perfectly de|ci&s;ive,
as it re&s;ts entirely on the recollection of tho&s;e &s;tudents who
attended his fir&s;t cour&s;es of moral philo&s;ophy at Gla&s;&s;gow; a recol|lection
which, at the di&s;tance of forty years, cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to
be very accurate. There exi&s;ts, however fortunately, a &s;hort manu|&s;cript
drawn up by Mr. SMITH in the year 1755, and pre&s;ented by
him to a &s;ociety of which he was then a member; in which paper, a
pretty long enumeration is given of certain leading principles, both
political and literary, to which he was anxious to e&s;tabli&s;h his ex|clu&s;ive
right; in order to prevent the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;ome rival claims
which he thought he had rea&s;on to apprehend, and to which his
&s;ituation as a Profe&s;&s;or, added to his unre&s;erved communications in
private companies, rendered him peculiarly liable. This paper is at
pre&s;ent in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. It is expre&s;&s;ed with a good deal of that hone&s;t and indignant warmth, which is perhaps unavoidable by a
man who is con&s;cious of the purity of his own intentions, when h
&s;u&s;pects that advantages have been taken of the frankne&s;s of his
temper. On &s;uch occa&s;ions, due allowances are not always made for
tho&s;e plagiari&s;ms which, however cruel in their effects, do not ne|ce&s;&s;arily
imply bad faith in tho&s;e who are guilty of them; for the
bulk of mankind, incapable them&s;elves of original thought, are per|fectly
unable to form a conception of the nature of the injury done
to a man of inventive genius, by encroaching on a favourite &s;pecu|lation.
For rea&s;ons known to &s;ome members of this Society, it
would be improper, by the publication of this manu&s;cript, to revive
the memory of private differences; and I &s;hould not have even al|luded
<PB N="lxxxi" REF="80">
to it, if I did not think it a valuable document of the progre&s;s
of Mr. SMITH's political ideas at a very early period. Many of the
mo&s;t important opinions in <HI>The Wealth of Nations</HI> are there detailed;
but I &s;hall quote only the following &s;entences: &startq;Man is generally
con&s;idered by &s;tate&s;men and projectors as the materials of a &s;ort of
political mechanics. Projectors di&s;turb nature in the cour&s;e of
her operations in human affairs; and it requires no more than to
let her alone, and give her fair play in the pur&s;uit of her ends,
that &s;he may e&s;tabli&s;h her own de&s;igns.&endq;&mdash;&startq;And in another pa&s;&s;age:
Little el&s;e is requi&s;ite to carry a &s;tate to the highe&s;t degree of opu|lence
from the loweft barbari&s;m, but peace, ea&s;y taxes, and a to|lerable
adminitration of ju&s;tice; all the re&s;t being brought about
by the natural cour&s;e of things. All governments which thwart
this natural cour&s;e, which force things into another channel, or
which endeavour to arre&s;t the progre&s;s of &s;ociety at a particular
point, are unnatural, and to &s;upport them&s;elves are obliged to be
oppre&s;&s;ive and tyrannical.&mdash;A great part of the opinions (he ob
&s;erves) enumerated in this paper is treated of at length in &s;ome
lectures which I have &s;till by me, and which were written in the
hand of a clerk who left my &s;ervice &s;ix years ago. They have all
of them been the con&s;tant &s;ubjects of my lectures &s;ince I fir&s;t
taught Mr. CRAIGIE's cla&s;s, the fir&s;t winter I &s;pent in Gla&s;gow,
down to this day, without any con&s;iderable variation. They had
all of them been the &s;ubjects of lectures which I read at Edin|burgh
the winter before I left it, and I can adduce innumerable
witne&s;&s;es, both from that place and from this, who will a&s;certain
them &s;ufficiently to be mine.&endq;</P>
<P>After all, perhaps the merit of &s;uch a work as Mr. SMITH's is to be
e&s;timated le&s;s from the novelty of the principles it contains, than from
<PB N="lxxxii" REF="81">
the rea&s;nings employed to &s;upport the&s;e principles, and from the &s;ci|entific
manner in which they are unfolded in their proper order and
connection. General a&s;&s;ertions with re&s;pect to the advantages of a
free commerce, may be collected from various writers of an early
date. But in que&s;tions of &s;o complicated a nature as occur in poli|tical
oeconomy, the credit of &s;uch opinions belongs of right to the
author who fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed their &s;olidity, and followed them out to
their remote con&s;equences; not to him who, by a fortunate accident,
fir&s;t &s;tumbled on the truth.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the principles which Mr. SMITH con&s;idered as more pecu|liarly
his own, his Inquiry exhibits a &s;y&s;tematical view of the mo&s;t
important articles of political oeconomy, &s;o as to &s;erve the purpo&s;e
of an elementary treati&s;e on that very exten&s;ive and difficult &s;cience.
The &s;kill and the comprehen&s;ivene&s;s of mind di&s;played in his ar|rangement,
can be judged of by tho&s;e alone who have compared it
with that adopted by his immediate predece&s;&s;ors. And perhaps, in
point of utility, the labour he has employed in connecting and me|thodi&s;ing
their &s;cattered ideas, is not le&s;s valuable than the re&s;ults of
his own original &s;peculations: For it is only when dige&s;ted in
a clear and natural order, that truths make their proper impre&s;|&s;ion
on the mind, and that erroneous opinions can be combated with
&s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>It does not belong to my pre&s;ent undertaking (even if I were
qualified for &s;uch a ta&s;k) to attempt the &s;eparation of the &s;olid and
important doctrines of Mr. SMITH's book from tho&s;e opinions
which appear exceptionable or doubtful. I acknowledge, that there
are &s;ome of his conclu&s;ions to which I would not be under&s;tood to
&s;ub&s;cribe implicitly; more particularly in that chapter, where he
treats of the principles of taxation, and which is certainly executed
<PB N="lxxxiii" REF="82">
in a manner more loo&s;e and un&s;atisfatory than the other parts of his
&s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>It would be improper for me to conclude this &s;ction without tak|ing
notice of the manly and dignified freedom with which the au|thor
uniformly delivers his opinions, and of the &s;uperiority which
he di&s;covers throughout, to all the little pa&s;&s;ions connected with the
factions of the times in which he wrote. Whoever takes the trouble
to compare the general tone of his compo&s;ition with the period of
its fir&s;t publication, cannot fail to feel and acknowledge the force of
this remark.&mdash;It is not often that a di&s;intere&s;ted zeal for truth has
&s;o &s;oon met with its ju&s;t reward. Philo&s;ophers (to u&s;e an expre&s;&s;ion
of Lord BACON's) are &startq;the &s;ervants of po&s;terity;&endq; and mo&s;t of
tho&s;e who have devoted their talents to the be&s;t intere&s;ts of man|kind,
have been obliged, like BACON, to &startq;bequeath their fame&endq;
to a race yet unborn, and to con&s;ole them&s;elves with the idea of
&s;owing what another generation was to reap:
<Q>In&s;ere Daphni pyros, carpent tua poma nepotes.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. SMITH was more fortunate; or rather, in this re&s;pect, his for|tune
was &s;ingular. He &s;urvived the publication of his work only
fifteen years; and yet, during that &s;hort period, he had not only the
&s;atisfaction of &s;eeing the oppo&s;ition it at fir&s;t excited, gradually &s;ub|&s;ide,
but to witne&s;s the practical influence of his writings on the
commercial policy of his country.</P>

<P>ABOUT two years after the publication of &startq;The Wealth of Nat|ions,&endq;
Mr. SMITH was appointed one of the Commi&s;&s;ioners
of his Maje&s;ty's Cu&s;toms in Scotland; a preferment which, in his
e&s;timation, derived an additional value from its being be&s;towed on
him at the reque&s;t of the Duke of BUCCLEUGH. The greater part
of the&s;e two years he pa&s;&s;ed at London, in a fociety too exten&s;ive
and varied to afford him any opportunity of indulging his ta&s;te for
&s;tudy. His time, however, was not lo&s;t to him&s;elf; for much of
it was &s;pent with &s;ome of the fir&s;t names in Engli&s;h literature. Of
the&s;e no unfavourable &s;pecimen is pre&s;erved by Dr. BARNARD, in

<P>In con&s;equence of Mr. SMITH's appointment to the Board of
Cu&s;toms, he removed, in 1778, to Edinburgh, where he &s;pent the
<PB N="lxxxv" REF="84">
la&s;t twelve years of his life; enjoying an a&s;&s;luence which was more
than equal to all his wants; and, what was to him of &s;till greater
value, the pro&s;pect of pa&s;&s;ing the remainder of his days among the
companions of his youth.</P>
<P>His mother, who, though now in extreme old age, &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
a con&s;iderable degree of health, and retained all her faculties unim|paired,
accompanied him to town; and his cou&s;in Mi&s;s JANE
DOUGLAS, (who had formerly been a member of his family at
Gla&s;gow, and for whom he had always felt the affection of a bro|ther,)
while &s;he divided with him tho&s;e tender attentions which he
aunt's infirmities required, relieved him of a charge for which he
was peculiarly ill qualified, by her friendly &s;uperintendance of his
dome&s;tic oeconomy.</P>
<P>The acce&s;&s;ion to his income which his new office brought him,
enabled him to gratify, to a much greater extent than his former
circum&s;tances admitted of, the natural genero&s;ity of his di&s;po&s;ition;
and the &s;tate of his funds at the time of his death, compared with
his very moderate e&s;tabli&s;hment, confirmed, beyond a doubt,
what his intimate acquaintances had often &s;u&s;pected, that a large
proportion of his annual &s;avings was allotted to offices of &s;ecret
charity. A &s;mall, but excellent library, which he had gradually
formed with great judgment in the &s;election; and a &s;imple, though
ho&s;pitable table, where, without the formality of an invitation, he
was always happy to receive his friends, were the only expences that
could be con&s;idered as his own<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Some very affecting in&s;tances of Mr. SMITH's beneficence, in ca&s;es where he found it impo&s;&s;ible to conceal entirely his good offices, have been mentioned to me by a near relation of his, and one of his mo&s;t confidential friends, Mi&s;s Ross, daugh|ter of the late PATRICK Ross, E&s;q. of Innernethy. They were all on a &s;cale much beyond what might have been expected from his fortune; and were accompanied with circum&s;tances equally honourable to the delicacy of his feelings and the liberality of his heart.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="lxxxvi" REF="85">
The change in his habits which his removal to Edinburgh pro|duced,
was not equally favourable to his literary pur&s;uits. The
duties of his office, though they required but little exertion of
thought, were yet &s;ufficient to wa&s;te his &s;pirits and to di&s;&s;ipate his
attention; and now that his career is clo&s;ed, it is impo&s;&s;ible to reflect
on the time they con&s;umed, without lamenting, that it had not been
employed in labours more pro&s;itable to the world, and more equal to
his mind.</P>
<P>During the fir&s;t years of his re&s;idence in this city, his &s;tudies
&s;eemed to be entirely &s;u&s;pended; and his pa&s;&s;ion for letters &s;erved
only to amu&s;e his lei&s;ure, and to animate his conver&s;ation. The in|firmities
of age, of which he very early began to feel the approaches,
reminded him at la&s;t, when it was too late, of what he yet owed
to the public, and to his own &s;ame. The principal materials of the
works which he had announced, had been long ago collected; and
little probably was wanting, but a few years of health and retire|ment,
to be&s;tow on them that &s;y&s;tematical arrangement in which he
delighted; and the ornaments of that flowing, and apparently artle&s;s
&s;tyle, which he had &s;tudiou&s;ly cultivated, but which, after all his
experience in compo&s;ition, he adju&s;ted, with extreme difficulty, to

The death of his mother in 1784, which was followed by that of
Mi&s;s DOUGLAS in 1788, contributed, it is probable, to fru&s;trate the&s;e
projects. They had been the objects of his affection for more than
&s;ixty years; and in their &s;ociety he had enjoyed, from his infancy,
all that he ever knew of the endearments of a family. He was now
alone, and helple&s;s; and, though he bore his lo&s;s with equanimity,
and regained apparently his former cheerfulne&s;s, yet his health and
&s;trength gradually declined till the period of his death, which hap|pened
in July 1790, about two years after that of his cou&s;in, and
&s;ix after that of his mother. His la&s;t illne&s;s, which aro&s;e from a
chronic ob&s;truction in his bowels, was lingering and painful; but
had every con&s;olation to &s;ooth it which he could derive from the
tendere&s;t &s;ympathy of his friends, and from the complete re&s;igna|tion
of his own mind.</P>
<P>A few days before his death, finding his end approach rapidly, he gave orders to de&s;troy all his manu&s;cripts, excepting &s;ome detached
e&s;&s;ays, which he entru&s;ted to the care of his executors; and they
were accordingly committed to the &s;lames. What were the parti|cular
contents of the&s;e papers, is not known even to his mo&s;t inti|mate
friends; but there can be no doubt that they con&s;i&s;ted, in part,
of the lectures on rhetoric, which he read at Edinburgh in the year
1748, and of the lectures on natural religion and on juri&s;prudence,
which formed part of his cour&s;e at Gla&s;gow. That this irreparable
<PB N="lxxxviii" REF="87">
injury to letters proceeded, in &s;ome degree, from an exce&s;&s;ive &s;olici|tude
in the author about his po&s;thumous reputation, may perhaps
be true; but with re&s;pect to &s;ome of his manu&s;cripts, may we not
&s;uppo&s;e, that he was influenced by higher motives? It is but feldom
that a philo&s;opher, who has been occupied from his youth with
moral or with political enquiries, &s;ucceeds completely to his wi&s;h in
&s;tating to others, the grounds upon which his own opinions are
founded; and hence it is, that the known principles of an indivi|dual,
who has approved to the public his candour, his liberality,
and his judgment, are entitled to a weight and an authority, inde|pendent
of the evidence which he is able, upon any particular occa|&s;ion,
to produce in their &s;upport. A fecret con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of this
circum&s;tance, and an apprehen&s;ion, that by not doing ju&s;tice to an
important argument, the progre&s;s of truth may be rather retarded
than advanced, have probably induced many authors to with-hold
from the world the unfini&s;hed re&s;ults of their mo&s;t valuable labours;
and to content them&s;elves with giving the general &s;anction of thei
&s;uffrages to truths which they regarded as peculiarly intere&s;ting to the
human race<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>Since writing the above, I have been favoured by Dr. HUTTON with the following particulars.</P>
<P>&startq;Some time before his la&s;t illne&s;s, when Mr. SMITH had occa&s;ion to go to London, he enjoined his friends, to whom he had entru&s;ted the di&s;po&s;al of his munu&s;cripts, that in the event of his death, they &s;hould de&s;troy all the volumes of his lectures, doing with the re&s;t of his manu&s;cripts what they plea&s;ed. When now he had become weak, and &s;aw the approaching period of his life, he &s;poke to his friends again upon the &s;ame &s;ubject. They entreated him to make his mind ea&s;y, as he might depend upon their fulfilling his de&s;ire. He was then fatis&s;ied. But &s;ome days afterwards, finding his anxiety not entirely removed, he begged one of them to de&s;troy the volumes immedi|ately. This accordingly was done; and his mind was &s;o much relieved, that he was able to receive his friends in the evening with his u&s;ual complacency.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;They had been in u&s;e to &s;up with him every Sunday; and that evening there was a pretty numerous meeting of them. Mr. SMITH not finding him&s;elf able to &s;it up with them as u&s;ual, retired to bed before &s;upper; and, as he went away, took leave of his friends by &s;aying, `I believe we mu&s;t adjourn this meeting to &s;ome other place.' He died a very few days afterwards.&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. RIDDELL, an intimate friend of Mr. SMITH's, who was pre&s;ent at one of the conver&s;ations on the &s;ubject of the manu&s;cripts, mentioned to me, in addition to Dr. HUTTON's note, that Mr. SMITH regretted, &startq;he had done &s;o little.&endq; &startq;But I meant (&s;aid he) to have done more; and there are materials in my papers, of which I could have made a great deal. But that is now out of the que&s;tion.&endq;</P>
<P>That the idea of de&s;troying &s;uch un&s;ini&s;hed works as might be in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion at the time of his death, was not the effect of any &s;udden or ha&s;ty re&s;olution, appears from the following letter to Mr. HUME, written by Mr. SMITH in 1773, at a time when he was preparing him&s;elf for a journey to London, with the pro&s;pect of a pretty long ab&s;ence from Scotland.</P>
<Q>MY DEAR FRIEND, <HI>Edinburgh, 16th April</HI> 1773.</Q>
<P>As I have left the care of all my literary papers to you, I mu&s;t tell you, that except tho&s;e which I carry along with me, there are none worth the publication, but a frag|ment of a great work, which contains a hi&s;tory of the a&s;tronomical &s;y&s;tems that were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively in fa&s;hion down to the time of DES CARTES. Whether that might not be publi&s;hed as a fragment of an intended juvenile work, I leave entirely to your judg|ment, though I begin to &s;u&s;pect my&s;elf that there is more re&s;inement than &s;olidity in &s;ome parts of it. This little work you will find in a thin folio paper book in my back room. All the other loo&s;e papers which you will find in that de&s;k, or within the gla&s;s folding doors of a bureau which &s;tands in my bed-room, together with about eighteen thin paper folio books, which you will likewi&s;e find within the &s;ame gla&s;s folding doors, I de&s;ire may be de&s;troyed without any examination. Unle&s;s I die very &s;uddenly, I &s;hall take care that the papers I carry with me &s;hall be carefully &s;ent to you.</P>

The additions to the Theory of Moral Sentiments, mo&s;t of which
were compo&s;ed under fevere di&s;ea&s;e, had fortunately been &s;ent to the
pre&s;s in the beginning of the preceding winter; and the author
lived to &s;ee the publication of the work. The moral and ferious
&s;train that prevails through the&s;e additions, when connected with
the circum&s;tance of his declining health, adds a peculiar charm to
his pathetic eloquence, and communicates a new intere&s;t, if po&s;&s;&s;ible,
<PB N="xc" REF="89">
to tho&s;e &s;ublime truths, which, in the academical retirement of his
youth, awakened the fir&s;t ardours of his genius, and on which the
la&s;t efforts of his mind repo&s;ed.</P>
<P>In a letter addre&s;&s;&s;ed, in the year 1787, to the Principal of the
Univer&s;ity of Gla&s;gow, in con&s;equence of being elected Rector
of that learned body, a plea&s;ing memorial remains of the &s;atisfaction
with which he always recollected that period of his literary career,
which had been more peculiarly con&s;ecrated to the&s;e important &s;tu|dies.
&startq;No preferment (&s;ays he) could have given me &s;o much real
&s;atisfaction. No man can owe greater obligations to a &s;ociety
than I do to the Univer&s;ity of Gla&s;gow. They educated me;
they &s;ent me to Oxford. Soon after my return to Scotland, they
elected me one of their own members; and afterwards preferred me
to another office, to which the abilities and virtues of the never
to be forgotten Dr. HUTCHESON had given a &s;uperior degree of
illu&s;tration. The period of thirteen years which I &s;pent as a
member of that &s;ociety, I remember as by far the mo&s;t u&s;eful,
and therefore as by far the happie&s;t and mo&s;t honourable pe|riod
of my life; and now, after three and twenty years ab&s;ence,
to be remembered in &s;o very agreeable a manner by my old
friends and protectors, gives me a heart-felt joy which I can|not
ea&s;ily expre&s;s to you.&endq;</P>
<P>THE &s;hort narrative which I have now fini&s;hed, however barren
of incident, may convey a general idea of the genius and charac|ter
of this illu&s;trious Man. Of the intellectual gifts and attainments
by which he was &s;o eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed;&mdash;of the originality and
comprehen&s;ivene&s;s of his views; the extent, the variety, and the
correctne&s;s of his information; the inexhau&s;tible fertility of his in|vention;
<PB N="xci" REF="90">
and the ornaments which his rich and beautiful imagina|tion
had borrowed from cla&s;&s;ical culture;&mdash;he has left behind him
la&s;ting monuments. To his private worth the mo&s;t certain of all
te&s;timonies may be found in that confidence, re&s;pect, and attach|ment,
which followed him through all the various relations of life.
The &s;erenity and gaiety he enjoyed, under the pre&s;&s;ure of his grow|ing
infirmities, and the warm intere&s;t he felt to the la&s;t, in every
thing connected with the welfare of his friends, will be long remem|bered
by a &s;mall circle, with whom, as long as his &s;trength permit|ted,
he regularly &s;pent an evening in the week; and to whom the
recollection of his worth &s;till forms a plea&s;ing, though melancholy
bond of union.</P>
<P>The more delicate and characteri&s;tical features of his mind, it is
perhaps impo&s;&s;ible to trace. That there were many peculiarities,
both in his manners, and in his intellectual habits, was manife&s;t to
the mo&s;t &s;uperficial ob&s;erver; but although, to tho&s;e who knew
him, the&s;e peculiarities detracted nothing from the re&s;pect which his
abilities commanded; and although, to his intimate friends, they
added an inexpre&s;&s;ible charm to his conver&s;ation, while they di&s;|played,
in the mo&s;t intere&s;ting light, the artle&s;s &s;implicity of his
heart; yet it would require a very &s;kilful pencil to pre&s;ent them to
the public eye. He was certainly not &s;itted for the general com|merce
of the world, or for the bu&s;ine&s;s of active life. The com|prehen&s;ive
&s;peculations with which he had been occupied from his
youth, and the variety of materials which his own invention con|tinually
&s;upplied to his thoughts, rendered him habitually inattentive
to familiar objects, and to common occurrences; and he frequently
exhibited in&s;tances of ab&s;ence, which have &s;carcely been &s;urpa&s;&s;ed
by the fancy of La BRUYERE. Even in company, he was apt to
<PB N="xcii" REF="91">
be ingro&s;&s;ed with his &s;tudies; and appeared, at times, by the motion
of his lips, as well as by his looks and ge&s;tures, to be in the fervour
of compo&s;ition. I have often, however, been &s;truck, at the di&s;|tance
of years, with his accurate memory of the mo&s;t trifling par|ticulars;
and am inclined to believe, from this and &s;ome other cir|cum&s;tances,
that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a power, not perhaps uncommon
among ab&s;ent men, of recollecting, in con&s;equence of &s;ub&s;equent
efforts of reflection, many occurrences which, at the time when
they happened, did not &s;eem to have &s;en&s;ibly attracted his notice.</P>
<P>To the defect now mentioned, it was probably owing, in part,
that he did not fall in ea&s;ily with the common dialogue of conver&s;a|tion,
and that he was &s;omewhat apt to convey his own ideas in the
form of a lecture. When he did &s;o, however, it never proceeded
from a wi&s;h to ingro&s;s the di&s;cour&s;e, or to gratify his vanity. His
own inclination di&s;po&s;ed him &s;o &s;trongly to enjoy in &s;ilence the
gaiety of tho&s;e around him, that his friends were often led to con|cert
little &s;chemes, in order to bring him on the &s;ubjects mo&s;t likely
to intere&s;t him. Nor do I think I &s;hall be accu&s;ed of going too far,
when I &s;ay, that he was &s;carcely ever known to &s;tart a new topic
him&s;elf, or to appear unprepared upon tho&s;e topics that were intro|duced
by others. Indeed, his conver&s;ation was never more amu&s;ing
than when he gave a loo&s;e to his genius, upon the very few branches
of knowledge of which he only po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the outlines.</P>
<P>The opinions he formed of men, upon a &s;light acquaintance, were
frequently erroneous; but the tendency of his nature inclined him
much more to blind partiality, than to ill-founded prejudice. The
enlarged views of human affairs, on which his mind habitually
dwelt, left him neither time nor inclination to &s;tudy, in detail,
<PB N="xciii" REF="92">
the unintere&s;ting peculiarities of ordinary characters; and accord|ingly,
though intimately acquainted with the capacities of the intel|lect,
and the workings of the heart, and accu&s;tomed, in his theories,
to mark, with the mo&s;t delicate hand, the nice&s;t &s;hades, both of ge|nius
and of the pa&s;&s;ions; yet, in judging of individuals, it &s;ome|times
happened, that his e&s;timates were, in a &s;urpri&s;ing degree, wide
of the truth.</P>
<P>The opinions, too, which, in the thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s and confidence
of his &s;ocial hours, he was accu&s;tomed to hazard on books, and on
que&s;tions of &s;peculation, were not uniformly &s;uch as might have
been expected from the &s;uperiority of his under&s;tanding, and the
&s;ingular con&s;i&s;tency of his philo&s;ophical principles. They were
liable to be influenced by accidental circum&s;tances, and by the hu|mour
of the moment; and when retailed by tho&s;e who only &s;aw
him occa&s;ionally, &s;ugge&s;ted fal&s;e and contradictory ideas of his real
&s;entiments. On the&s;e, however, as on mo&s;t other occa&s;ions, there
was always much truth, as well as ingenuity, in his remarks; and
if the different opinions which, at different times, he pronounced
upon the &s;ame &s;ubject, had been all combined together, &s;o as to
modify and limit each other, they would probably have afforded
materials for a deci&s;ion, equally comprehen&s;ive and ju&s;t. But, in
the &s;ociety of his friends, he had no di&s;po&s;ition to form tho&s;e qua|lified
conclu&s;ions that we admire in his writings; and he generally
contented him&s;elf with a bold and ma&s;terly &s;ketch of the object,
from the fir&s;t point of view in which his temper, or his fancy, pre|&s;ented
it. Something of the &s;ame kind might be remarked, when
he attempted, in the flow of his &s;pirits, to delineate tho&s;e characters
which, from long intimacy, he might have been &s;uppo&s;ed to un|der&s;tand
thoroughly. The picture was always lively, and expre&s;|&s;ive;
<PB N="xciv" REF="93">
and commonly bore a &s;trong and amu&s;ing re&s;emblance to the
original, when viewed under one particular a&s;pect; but &s;eldom,
perhaps, conveyed a ju&s;t and complete conception of it in all its
dimen&s;ions and proportions.&mdash;In a word, it was the fault of his un|premeditated
judgments, to be too &s;y&s;tematical, and too much in ex|tremes.</P>
<P>But,
in whatever way the&s;e trifling peculiarities in his manners
may be explained, there can be no doubt, that they were intimately
connected with the genuine artle&s;&s;ne&s;s of his mind. In this amiable
quality, he often recalled to his friends, the accounts that are given
of good LA FONTAINE; a quality which in him derived a peculiar
grace from the &s;ingularity of its combination with tho&s;e powers of
rea&s;on and of eloquence which, in his political and moral writings,
have long engaged the admiration of Europe.</P>
<P>In his external form and appearance, there was nothing uncom|mon.
When perfectly at ea&s;e, and when warmed with conver&s;ation,
his ge&s;tures were animated, and not ungraceful; and, in the &s;ociety
of tho&s;e he loved, his features were often brightened with a &s;mile of
inexpre&s;&s;ible benignity. In the company of &s;trangers, his tendency
to ab&s;ence, and perhaps &s;till more his con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of this tendency,
rendered his manner &s;omewhat embarra&s;&s;ed;&mdash;an effect which was
probably not a little heightened by tho&s;e &s;peculative ideas of pro|priety,
which his reclu&s;e habits tended at once to perfect in his con|ception,
and to dimini&s;h his power of realizing. He never &s;at for
his picture; but the medallion of TASSIE conveys an exact
idea of his profile, and of the general expre&s;&s;ion of his counte|nance.</P>
<P><PB N="xcv" REF="94">
The valuable library that he had collected he bequeathed, together
with the re&s;t of his property, to his cou&s;in Mr. DAVID DOUGLAS,
Advocate. In the education of this young gentleman, he had em|ployed
much of his lei&s;ure; and it was only two years before his
death, (at a time when he could ill &s;pare the plea&s;ure of his &s;ociety,)

<P>WONDER, Surpri&s;e, and Admiration, are words which, though
often confounded, denote, in our language, &s;entiments that
are indeed allied, but that are in &s;ome re&s;pects different al&s;o,
and di&s;tinct from one another. What is new and &s;ingular, excites that
&s;entiment which, in &s;trict propriety, is called Wonder; what is un|expected,
Surpri&s;e; and what is great or beautiful, Admiration.</P>
<P>We wonder at all extraordinary and uncommon objects, at all the
rarer phaenomena of nature, at meteors, comets, eclip&s;es, at &s;ingular
plants and animals, and at every thing, in &s;hort, with which we
have before been either little or not at all acquainted; and we &s;till
wonder, though forewarned of what we are to &s;ee.</P>
<P>We are &s;urpri&s;ed at tho&s;e things which we have &s;een often, but
which we lea&s;t of all expected to meet with in the place where we
find them; we are &s;urpri&s;ed at the &s;udden appearance of a friend,
whom we have &s;een a thou&s;and times, but whom we did not imagine
we were to &s;ee then.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="97">
We admire the beauty of a plain or the greatne&s;s of a mountain,
though we have &s;een both often before, and though nothing appears
to us in either, but what we had expected with certainty to &s;ee.</P>
<P>Whether this critici&s;m upon the preci&s;e meaning of the&s;e words
be ju&s;t, is of little importance. I imagine it is ju&s;t, though I ac|knowledge,
that the be&s;t writers in our language have not always
made u&s;e of them according to it. Milton, upon the appearance of
Death to Satan, &s;ays, that
<Q><L>The Fiend what this might be admir'd;</L>
<L>Admir'd, not fear'd.&mdash;</L></Q>
But if this critici&s;m be ju&s;t, the proper expre&s;&s;ion &s;hould have been
<HI>wonder'd.</HI>&mdash;Dryden, upon the di&s;covery of Iphigenia &s;leeping, &s;ays,
that
<Q><L>The fool of nature &s;tood with &s;tupid eyes</L>
<L>And gaping mouth, that te&s;tified &s;urpri&s;e.</L></Q>
But what Cimon mu&s;t have felt upon this occa&s;ion could not &s;o
much be Surpri&s;e, as Wonder and Admiration. All that I contend for
is, that the &s;entiments excited by what is new, by what is unexpected,
and by what is great and beautiful, are really different, however the
words made u&s;e of to expre&s;s them may &s;ometimes be confounded.
Even the admiration which is excited by beauty, is quite different
(as will appear more fully hereafter) from that which is in&s;pired by
greatne&s;s, though we have but one word to denote them.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;entiments, like all others when in&s;pired by one and the
&s;ame object, mutually &s;upport and enliven one another: an object
with which we are quite familiar, and which we &s;ee every day, pro|duces,
though both great and beautiful, but a &s;mall effect upon us;
becau&s;e our admiration is not &s;upported either by Wonder or by
Surpri&s;e: and if we have heard a very accurate de&s;cription of a
<PB N="5" REF="98">
mon&s;ter, our Wonder will be the le&s;s when we fee it; becau&s;e our
previous knowledge of it will in a great mea&s;ure prevent our
Surpri&s;e.</P>
<P>It is the de&s;ign of this E&s;&s;ay to con&s;ider particularly the nature and
cau&s;es of each of the&s;e &s;entiments, who&s;e influence is of far wider
extent than we &s;hould be apt upon a carele&s;s view to imagine. I

which it is by nature fitted to excite, the mind mu&s;t have been pre|pared

emotion which the object it&s;elf would excite: the change, therefore,
which its pre&s;ence produces comes thus to be le&s;s con&s;iderable, and
the emotion or pa&s;&s;ion which it excites glides gradually and ea&s;ily
into the heart, without violence, pain, or difficulty.</P>
<P>But the contrary of all this happens when the object is unexpected;
the pa&s;&s;ion is then poured in all at once upon the heart, which is

one of what is capable of exciting them. Who would choo&s;e all at

him, without taking care before-hand, by alarming him with
an uncertain fear, to announce, if one may &s;ay &s;o, his misfortune,
and thereby prepare and di&s;po&s;e him for receiving the tidings?</P>
<P>Tho&s;e panic terrors which &s;ometimes &s;eize armies in the field, or
great cities, when an enemy is in the neighbourhood, and which
deprive for a time the mo&s;t determined of all deliberate judgments,
are never excited but by the &s;udden apprehen&s;ion of unexpected
danger. Such violent con&s;ternations, which at once confound whole
multitudes, benumb their under&s;tandings, and agitate their hearts,
with all the agony of extravagant fear, can never be produced by
any fore&s;een danger, how great &s;oever. Fear, though naturally a
very &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion, never ri&s;es to &s;uch exce&s;&s;es, unle&s;s exa&s;perated
both by Wonder, from the uncertain nature of the danger, and by
Surpri&s;e, from the &s;uddenne&s;s of the apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>Surpri&s;e, therefore, is not to be regarded as an original emotion
of a &s;pecies di&s;tinct from all others. The violent and &s;udden change
produced upon the mind, when an emotion of any kind is brought
&s;uddenly upon it, con&s;titutes the whole nature of Surpri&s;e.</P>
<P>But when not only a pa&s;&s;ion and a great pa&s;&s;ion comes all at
once upon the mind, but when it comes upon it while the mind
is in the mood mo&s;t unfit for conceiving it, the Surpri&s;e is then the
<PB N="7" REF="100">
greate&s;t. Surpri&s;es of joy when the mind is &s;unk into grief, or of
grief when it is elated with joy, are therefore the mo&s;t un&s;upportable.
The change is in this ca&s;e the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible. Not only a &s;trong
pa&s;&s;ion is conceived all at once, but a &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion the direct oppo|&s;ite
of that which was before in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;oul. When a load
of &s;orrow comes down upon the heart that is expanded and elated
with gaiety and joy, it &s;eems not only to damp and oppre&s;s it, but
almo&s;t to cru&s;h and brui&s;e it, as a real weight would cru&s;h and brui&s;e
the body. On the contrary, when from an unexpected change
of fortune, a tide of gladne&s;s &s;eems, if I may &s;ay &s;o, to &s;pring up
all at once within it, when depre&s;&s;ed and contracted with grief and
&s;orrow, it feels as if &s;uddenly extended and heaved up with violent
and irre&s;i&s;tible force, and is torn with pangs of all others mo&s;t
exqui&s;ite, and which almo&s;t always occa&s;ion faintings, deliriums, and
&s;ometimes in&s;tant death. For it may be worth while to ob&s;erve, that
though grief be a more violent pa&s;&s;ion than joy, as indeed all
unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations &s;eem naturally more pungent than the oppo&s;ite
agreeable ones, yet of the two, Surpri&s;es of joy are &s;till more in&s;up|portable
than Surpri&s;es of grief. We are told that after the battle of
Thra&s;imenus, while a Roman lady, who had been informed that her
&s;on was &s;lain in the action, was &s;itting alone bemoaning her misfor|fortunes,
the young man who e&s;caped came &s;uddenly into the
room to her, and that &s;he cried out and expired in&s;tantly in a
tran&s;port of joy. Let us &s;uppo&s;e the contrary of this to have
happened, and that in the mid&s;t of dome&s;tic fe&s;tivity and mirth, he
had &s;uddenly fallen down dead at her feet, is it likely that the effects
would have been equally violent? I imagine not. The heart &s;prings
to joy with a &s;ort of natural ela&s;ticity, it abandons it&s;elf to &s;o agreeable
an emotion, as &s;oon as the object is pre&s;ented; it &s;eems to pant and
leap forward to meet it, and the pa&s;&s;ion in its full force takes
at once entire and complete po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;oul. But it is
otherways with grief; the heart recoils from, and re&s;i&s;ts the fir&s;t
<PB N="8" REF="101">
approaches of that di&s;agreeable pa&s;&s;ion, and it requires &s;ome time
before the melancholy object can produce its full effect. Grief comes
on &s;lowly and gradually, nor ever ri&s;es at once to that height of
agony to which it is increa&s;ed after a little time. But joy comes
ru&s;hing upon us all at once like a torrent. The change produced
therefore by a Surpri&s;e of joy is more &s;udden, and upon that account
more violent and apt to have more fatal effects, than that which is
occa&s;ioned by a Surpri&s;e of grief; there &s;eems too to be &s;omething
in the nature of Surpri&s;e, which makes it unite more ea&s;ily with the
bri&s;k and quick motion of joy, than with the &s;lower and heavier
movement of grief. Mo&s;t men who can take the trouble to recollect,
will find that they have heard of more people who died or became
di&s;tracted with &s;udden joy, than with &s;udden grief. Yet from the
nature of human affairs, the latter mu&s;t be much more frequent than
the former. A man may break his leg, or lo&s;e his &s;on, though he
has had no warning of either of the&s;e events, but he can hardly
meet with an extraordinary piece of good fortune, without having
had &s;ome fore&s;ight of what was to happen.</P>
<P>Not only grief and joy but all the other pa&s;&s;ions, are more violent,
when oppo&s;ite extremes &s;ucceed each other. Is any re&s;entment &s;o
keen as what follows the quarrels of lovers, or any love &s;o pa&s;&s;ionate
as what attends their reconcilement?</P>
<P>Even the objects of the external &s;en&s;es affect us in a more lively
manner, when oppo&s;ite extremes &s;ucceed to, or are placed be&s;ide each
other. Moderate warmth &s;eems intolerable heat if felt after ex|treme
cold. What is bitter will &s;eem more &s;o when ta&s;ted after
what is very &s;weet; a dirty white will &s;eem bright and pure when
placed by a jet black. The vivacity in &s;hort of every &s;en&s;ation,
as well as of every &s;entiment, &s;eems to be greater or le&s;s in propor|tion
to the change made by the impre&s;&s;ion of either upon the &s;itua|&s;ituation
<PB N="9" REF="102">
of the mind or organ; but this change mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be
the greate&s;t when oppo&s;ite &s;entiments and &s;en&s;ations are contra&s;ted,
or &s;ucceed immediately to one another. Both &s;entiments and &s;en|&s;ations
are then the livelie&s;t; and this &s;uperior vivacity proceeds
from nothing but their being brought upon the mind or organ when
in a &s;tate mo&s;t unfit for conceiving them.</P>
<P>As the oppo&s;ition of contra&s;ted &s;entiments heightens their vivacity,
&s;o the re&s;emblance of tho&s;e which immediately &s;ucceed each other
renders them more faint and languid. A parent who has lo&s;t &s;everal
children immediately after one another, will be le&s;s affected with
the death of the la&s;t than with that of the fir&s;t, though the lo&s;s in
it&s;elf be, in this ca&s;e, undoubtedly greater; but his mind being al|ready
&s;unk into &s;orrow, the new misfortune &s;eems to produce no
other effect than a continuance of the &s;ame melancholy, and is by
no means apt to occa&s;ion &s;uch tran&s;ports of grief as are ordinarily
excited by the fir&s;t calamity of the kind; he receives it, though with
great dejection, yet with &s;ome degree of calmne&s;s and compo&s;ure,
and without any thing of that angui&s;h and agitation of mind which
the novelty of the misfortune is apt to occa&s;ion. Tho&s;e who have
been unfortunate through the whole cour&s;e of their lives are often
indeed habitually melancholy, and &s;ometimes peevi&s;h and &s;plenetic,
yet upon any fre&s;h di&s;appointment, though they are vexed and com|plain
a little, they &s;eldom fly out into any more violent pa&s;&s;ion, and
never fall into tho&s;e tran&s;ports of rage or grief which often, upon
the like occa&s;ions, di&s;tract the fortunate and &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>Upon this are founded, in a great mea&s;ure, &s;ome of the effects of
habit and cu&s;tom. It is well known that cu&s;tom deadens the viva|city
of both pain and plea&s;ure, abates the grief we &s;hould feel for
the one, and weakens the joy we &s;hould derive from the other. The
pain is &s;upported without agony, and the plea&s;ure enjoyed without
<PB N="10" REF="103">
rapture: becau&s;e cu&s;tom and the frequent repetition of any object
comes at la&s;t to form and bend the mind or organ to that habitual
mood and di&s;po&s;ition which &s;its them to receive its impre&s;&s;ion, with|out
undergoing any very violent change.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Wonder, or of the Effects of Novelty.</HEAD>
<P>IT is evident that the mind takes plea&s;ure in ob&s;erving the re|&s;emblances
that are di&s;coverable betwixt different objects. It is
by means of &s;uch ob&s;ervations that it endeavours to arrange and
methodi&s;e all its ideas, and to reduce them into proper cla&s;&s;es and
a&s;&s;ortments. Where it can ob&s;erve but one &s;ingle quality, that is
common to a great variety of otherwi&s;e widely different objects,
that &s;ingle circum&s;tance will be &s;ufficient for it to connect them all
together, to reduce them to one common cla&s;s, and to call them by
one general name. It is thus that all things endowed with a power
of &s;elf-motion, bea&s;ts, birds, fi&s;hes, in&s;ects, are cla&s;&s;ed under the ge|neral
name of Animal; and that the&s;e again, along with tho&s;e
which want that power, are arranged under the &s;till more general
word Sub&s;tance: and this is the origin of tho&s;e a&s;&s;ortments of ob|jects
and ideas which in the &s;chools are called Genera and Species,
and of tho&s;e ab&s;tract and general names, which in all languages are
made u&s;e of to expre&s;s them.</P>
<P>The further we advance in knowledge and experience, the greater
number of divi&s;ions and &s;ubdivi&s;ions of tho&s;e Genera and Species we
are both inclined and obliged to make. We ob&s;erve a greater va|riety
of particularities among&s;t tho&s;e things which have a gro&s;s re|&s;emblance;
and having made new divi&s;ions of them, according to
<PB N="11" REF="104">
tho&s;e newly-ob&s;erved particularities, we are then no longer to be
&s;atisfied with being able to refer an object to a remote genus, or
very general cla&s;s of things, to many of which it has but a loo&s;e
and imperfect re&s;emblance. A per&s;on, indeed, unacquainted with
botany may expect to &s;atisfy your curio&s;ity, by telling you, that
&s;uch a vegetable is a weed, or, perhaps in &s;till more general terms,
that it is a plant. But a botani&s;t will neither give nor accept of &s;uch
an an&s;wer. He has broke and divided that great cla&s;s of objects
into a number of inferior a&s;&s;ortments, according to tho&s;e varieties
which his experience has di&s;covered among them; and he wants to
refer each individual plant to &s;ome tribe of vegetables, with all of
which it may have a more exact re&s;emblance, than with many things
comprehended under the exten&s;ive genus of plants. A child ima|gines
that it gives a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer when it tells you, that an
object who&s;e name it knows not is a thing, and fancies that it in|forms
you of &s;omething, when it thus a&s;certains to which of the
two mo&s;t obvious and comprehen&s;ive cla&s;&s;es of objects a particular
impre&s;&s;ion ought to be referred; to the cla&s;s of realities or &s;olid
&s;ub&s;tances which it calls <HI>things,</HI> or to that of appearances which it
calls <HI>nothings.</HI></P>
<P>Whatever, in &s;hort, occurs to us we are fond of referring to &s;ome
&s;pecies or cla&s;s of things, with all of which it has a nearly exact re|&s;emblance;
and though we often know no more about them than
about it, yet we are apt to fancy that by being able to do &s;o, we
&s;how our&s;elves to be better acquainted with it, and to have a more
thorough in&s;ight into its nature. But when &s;omething quite new and
&s;ingular is pre&s;ented, we feel our&s;elves incapable of doing this. The
memory cannot, from all its &s;tores, ca&s;t up any image that nearly
re&s;embles this &s;trange appearance. If by &s;ome of its qualities it &s;eems
to re&s;emble, and to be connected with a &s;pecies which we have before
been acquainted with, it is by others &s;eparated and detached from
<PB N="12" REF="105">
that, and from all the other a&s;&s;ortments of things we have hitherto
been able to make. It &s;tands alone and by it&s;elf in the imagination,
and refu&s;es to be grouped or confounded with any &s;et of objects
whatever. The imagination and memory exert them&s;elves to no
purpo&s;e, and in vain look around all their cla&s;&s;es of ideas in order to
find one under which it may be arranged. They fluctuate to no
purpo&s;e from thought to thought, and we remain &s;till uncertain and
undetermined where to place it, or what to think of it. It is this
fluctuation and vain recollection, together with the emotion or move|ment
of the &s;pirits that they excite, which con&s;titute the &s;entiment
properly called <HI>Wonder,</HI> and which occa&s;ion that &s;taring, and &s;ome|times
that rolling of the eyes, that &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the breath, and
that &s;welling of the heart, which we may all ob&s;erve, both in our&s;elves
and others, when wondering at &s;ome new object, and which are the
natural &s;ymptoms of uncertain and undetermined thought. What
&s;ort of a thing can that be? What is that like? are the que&s;tions
which, upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion, we are all naturally di&s;po&s;ed to a&s;k.
If we can recollect many &s;uch objects which exactly re&s;emble this
new appearance, and which pre&s;ent them&s;elves to the imagination
naturally, and as it were of their own accord, our Wonder is en|tirely
at an end. If we can recollect but a few, and which it re|quires
too &s;ome trouble to be able to call up, our Wonder is indeed
dimini&s;hed, but not quite de&s;troyed. If we can recollect none, but
are quite at a lo&s;s, it is the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>With what curious attention does a naturali&s;t examine a &s;ingular
plant, or a &s;ingular fo&s;&s;il, that is pre&s;ented to him? He is at no lo&s;s
to refer it to the general genus of plants or fo&s;&s;ils; but this does not
&s;atisfy him, and when he con&s;iders all the different tribes or &s;pecies
of either with which he has hitherto been acquainted, they all, he
thinks, refu&s;e to admit the new object among them. It &s;tands alone
in his imagination, and as it were detached from all the other &s;pecies
<PB N="13" REF="106">
of that genus to which it belongs. He labours, however, to con|nect
it with &s;ome one or other of them. Sometimes he thinks it
may be placed in this, and &s;ometimes in that other a&s;&s;ortment; nor
is he ever &s;atisfied, till he has fallen upon one which, in mo&s;t of
its qualities, it re&s;embles. When he cannot do this, rather than it
&s;hould &s;tand quite by it&s;elf, he will enlarge the precincts, if I may
&s;ay &s;o, of &s;ome &s;pecies, in order to make room for it; or he will
create a new &s;pecies on purpo&s;e to receive it, and call it a Play of
Nature, or give it &s;ome other appellation, under which he arranges
all the oddities that he knows not what el&s;e to do with. But to
&s;ome cla&s;s or other of known objects he mu&s;t refer it, and betwixt
it and them he mu&s;t find out &s;ome re&s;emblance or other, before he
can get rid of that Wonder, that uncertainty and anxious curio&s;ity
excited by its &s;ingular appearance, and by its di&s;&s;imilitude with all
the objects he had hitherto ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>As &s;ingle and individual objects thus excite our Wonder when, by
their uncommon qualities and &s;ingular appearance, they make us
uncertain to what &s;pecies of things we ought to refer them; &s;o a
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of objects which follow one another in an uncommon train
or order, will produce the &s;ame effect, though there be nothing par|ticular
in any one of them taken by it&s;elf.</P>
<P>When one accu&s;tomed object appears after another, which it does
not u&s;ually follow, it fir&s;t excites, by its unexpectedne&s;s, the &s;enti|ment
properly called Surpri&s;e, and afterwards, by the &s;ingularity of
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, or order of its appearance, the &s;entiment properly
called Wonder. We &s;tart and are &s;urpri&s;ed at &s;eeing it there, and
then wonder how it came there. The motion of a &s;mall piece of
iron along a plain table is in it&s;elf no extraordinary object, yet the
per&s;on who fir&s;t &s;aw it begin, without any vi&s;ible impul&s;e, in con&s;e|quence
of the motion of a load&s;tone at &s;ome little di&s;tance from it,
<PB N="14" REF="107">
could not behold it without the mo&s;t extreme Surpri&s;e; and when
that momentary emotion was over, he would &s;till wonder how it
came to be conjoined to an event with which, according to the or|dinary
train of things, he could have &s;o little &s;u&s;pected it to have any
connection.</P>
<P>When two objects, however unlike, have often been ob&s;erved to
follow each other, and have con&s;tantly pre&s;ented them&s;elves to the
&s;en&s;es in that order, they come to be &s;o connected together in the
fancy, that the idea of the one &s;eems, of its own accord, to call up
and introduce that of the other. If the objects are &s;till ob&s;erved to
&s;ucceed each other as before, this connection, or, as it has been
called, this a&s;&s;ociation of their ideas, becomes &s;tricter and &s;tricter,
and the habit of the imagination to pa&s;&s; from the conception of the
one to that of the other, grows more and more rivetted and con|firmed.
As its ideas move more rapidly than external objects, it is
continually running before them, and therefore anticipates, before it
happens, every event which falls out according to this ordinary
cour&s;e of things. When objects &s;ucceed each other in the &s;ame train
in which the ideas of the imagination have thus been accu&s;tomed to
move, and in which, though not conducted by that chain of events
pre&s;ented to the &s;en&s;es, they have acquired a tendency to go on of
their own accord, &s;uch objects appear all clo&s;ely connected with one
another, and the thought glides ea&s;ily along them, without effort
and without interruption. They fall in with the natural career of
the imagination; and as the ideas which repre&s;ented &s;uch a train of
things would &s;eem all mutually to introduce each other, every la&s;t
thought to be called up by the foregoing, and to call up the &s;ucceed|ing;
&s;o when the objects them&s;elves occur, every la&s;t event &s;eems,
in the &s;ame manner, to be introduced by the foregoing, and to in|troduce
the &s;ucceeding. There is no break, no &s;top, no gap, no
interval. The ideas excited by &s;o coherent a chain of things &s;eem,
<PB N="15" REF="108">
as it were, to float through the mind of their own accord, without
obliging it to exert it&s;elf, or to make any effort in order to pa&s;s from
one of them to another.</P>
<P>But if this cu&s;tomary connection be interrupted, if one or more
objects appear in an order quite different from that to which the
imagination has been accu&s;tomed, and for which it is prepared, the
contrary of all this happens. We are at fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;ed by the unex|pectedne&s;s
of the new appearance, and when that momentary emotion
is over, we &s;till wonder how it came to occur in that place. The
imagination no longer feels the u&s;ual facility of pa&s;&s;ing from the event
which goes before to that which comes after. It is an order or law
of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to which it has not been accu&s;tomed, and which it
therefore finds &s;ome difficulty in following, or in attending to. The
fancy is &s;topped and interrupted in that natural movement or career,
according to which it was proceeding. Tho&s;e two events &s;eem to
&s;tand at a di&s;tance from each other; it endeavours to bring them to|gether,
but they refu&s;e to unite; and it feels, or imagines it feels,
&s;omething like a gap or interval betwixt them. It naturally he&s;i|tates,
and, as it were, pau&s;es upon the brink of this interval; it
endeavours to find out &s;omething which may fill up the gap,
which, like a bridge, may &s;o far at lea&s;t unite tho&s;e &s;eemingly
di&s;tant objects, as to render the pa&s;&s;age of the thought betwixt them
&s;mooth, and natural, and ea&s;y. The &s;uppo&s;ition of a chain of inter|mediate,
though invi&s;ible, events, which &s;ucceed each other in a
train &s;imilar to that in which the imagination has been accu&s;tomed to
move, and which link together tho&s;e two disjointed appearances,
is the only means by which the imagination can fill up this interval,
is the only bridge which, if one may &s;ay &s;o, can &s;mooth its pa&s;&s;age
from the one object to the other. Thus, when we ob&s;erve the mo|tion
of the iron, in con&s;equence of that of the load&s;tone, we gaze
and he&s;itate, and feel a want of connection betwixt two events
<PB N="16" REF="109">
which follow one another in &s;o unu&s;ual a train. But when, with
Des Cartes, we imagine certain invi&s;ible effluvia to circulate round
one of them, and by their repeated impul&s;es to impel the other, both
to move towards it, and to follow its motion, we fill up the interval
betwixt them, we join them together by a &s;ort of bridge, and thus take
off that he&s;itation and difficulty which the imagination felt in pa&s;&s;ing
from the one to the other. That the iron &s;hould move after the
load&s;tone &s;eems, upon this hypothe&s;is, in &s;ome mea&s;ure according to
the ordinary cour&s;e of things. Motion after impul&s;e is an order of
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion with which of all things we are the mo&s;t familiar. Two
objects which are &s;o connected &s;eem no longer to be disjoined, and
the imagination flows &s;moothly and ea&s;ily along them.</P>
<P>Such is the nature of this &s;econd &s;pecies of Wonder, which ari&s;es
from an unu&s;ual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of things. The &s;top which is thereby
given to the career of the imagination, the difficulty which it finds
in pa&s;&s;ing along &s;uch disjointed objects, and the feeling of &s;ome|thing
like a gap or interval betwixt them, con&s;titute the whole e&s;|&s;ence
of this emotion. Upon the clear di&s;covery of a connecting
chain of intermediate events, it vani&s;hes altogether. What ob|&s;tructed
the movement of the imagination is then removed. Who
wonders at the machinery of the opera-hou&s;e who has once been
admitted behind the &s;cenes? In the Wonders of nature, however,
it rarely happens that we can di&s;cover &s;o clearly this connecting
chain. With regard to a few even of them, indeed, we &s;eem to
have been really admitted behind the &s;cenes, and our Wonder ac|cordingly
is entirely at an end. Thus the eclip&s;es of the &s;un and
moon, which once, more than all the other appearances in the hea|vens,
excited the terror and amazement of mankind, &s;eem now no
longer to be wonderful, &s;ince the connecting chain has been found
out which joins them to the ordinary cour&s;e of things. Nay, in
tho&s;e ca&s;es in which we have been le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful, even the vague
<PB N="17" REF="110">
hypothe&s;es of Des Cartes, and the yet more indetermined notions
of Ari&s;totle, have, with their followers, contributed to give &s;ome co|herence
to the appearances of nature, and might dimini&s;h, though
they could not de&s;troy, their Wonder. If they did not completely
fill up the interval betwixt the two disjointed objects, they be&s;towed
upon them, however, &s;ome &s;ort of loo&s;e connection which they
wanted before.</P>
<P>That the imagination feels a real difficulty in pa&s;&s;ing along two
events which follow one another in an uncommon order, may be
confirmed by many obvious ob&s;ervations. If it attempts to attend
beyond a certain time to a long &s;eries of this kind, the continual
efforts it is obliged to make, in order to pa&s;s from one object to
another, and thus follow the progre&s;s of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, &s;oon fa|tigue
it, and if repeated too often, di&s;order and disjoint its whole
frame. It is thus that too &s;evere an application to &s;tudy &s;ometimes
brings on lunacy and frenzy, in tho&s;e e&s;pecially who are &s;omewhat
advanced in life, but who&s;e imaginations, from being too late in ap|plying,
have not got tho&s;e habits which di&s;po&s;e them to follow ea&s;ily
the rea&s;onings in the ab&s;tract &s;ciences. Every &s;tep of a demon&s;tra|tion,
which to an old practitioner is quite natural and ea&s;y, requires
from them the mo&s;t inten&s;e application of thought. Spurred on,
however, either by ambition, or by admiration for the &s;ubject, they
&s;till continue till they become, fir&s;t confu&s;ed, then giddy, and at la&s;t
di&s;tracted. Could we conceive a per&s;on of the &s;ounde&s;t judgment,
who had grown up to maturity, and who&s;e imagination had acquired
tho&s;e habits, and that mold, which the con&s;titution of things in this
world nece&s;&s;arily impre&s;s upon it, to be all at once tran&s;ported alive
to &s;ome other planet, where nature was governed by laws quite dif|ferent
from tho&s;e which take place here; as he would be continually
obliged to attend to events, which mu&s;t to him appear in the highe&s;t
degree jarring, irregular, and di&s;cordant, he would &s;oon feel the
<PB N="18" REF="111">
&s;ame confu&s;ion and giddine&s;s begin to come upon him, which would
at la&s;t end in the &s;ame manner, in lunacy and di&s;traction. Neither,
to produce this effect, is it nece&s;&s;ary that the objects &s;hould be either
great or intere&s;ting, or even uncommon, in them&s;elves. It is &s;uffi|cient
that they follow one another in an uncommon order. Let any
one attempt to look over even a game of cards, and to attend parti|cularly
to every &s;ingle &s;troke, and if he is unacquainted with the
nature and rules of the game; that is, with the laws which regu|late
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the cards; he will &s;oon feel the &s;ame confu&s;ion
and giddine&s;s begin to come upon him, which, were it to be conti|nued
for days and months, would end in the &s;ame manner, in lunacy
and di&s;traction. But if the mind be thus thrown into the mo&s;t vio|lent
di&s;order, when it attends to a long &s;eries of events which fol|low
one another in an uncommon train, it mu&s;t feel &s;ome degree of
the &s;ame di&s;order, when it ob&s;erves even a &s;ingle event fall out in
this unu&s;ual manner: for the violent di&s;order can ari&s;e from no|thing
but the too frequent repetition of this &s;maller unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>That it is the unu&s;ualne&s;s alone of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion which occa&s;ions
this &s;top and interruption in the progre&s;s of the imagination, as well
as the notion of an interval betwixt the two immediately &s;ucceeding
objects, to be filled up by &s;ome chain of intermediate events, is not
le&s;s evident. The &s;ame orders of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, which to one &s;et of
men &s;eem quite according to the natural cour&s;e of things, and &s;uch
as require no intermediate events to join them, &s;hall to another
appear altogether incoherent and disjointed, unle&s;s &s;ome &s;uch events
be &s;uppo&s;ed: and this for no other rea&s;on, but becau&s;e &s;uch orders
of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion are familiar to the one, and &s;trange to the other. When
we enter the work-hou&s;es of the mo&s;t common artizans; &s;uch as
dyers, brewers, di&s;tillers; we ob&s;erve a number of appearances,
which pre&s;ent them&s;elves in an order that &s;eems to us very &s;trange
and wonderful. Our thought cannot ea&s;ily follow it, we feel an
<PB N="19" REF="112">
interval betwixt every two of them, and require &s;ome chain of inter|mediate
events, to fill it up, and link them together. But the artizan
him&s;elf, who has been for many years familiar with the con&s;e|quences
of all the operations of his art, feels no &s;uch interval. They
fall in with what cu&s;tom has made the natural movement of his ima|gination:
they no longer excite his Wonder, and if he is not a
genius &s;uperior to his profe&s;&s;ion, &s;o as to be capable of making
the very ea&s;y reflection, that tho&s;e things, though familiar to him,
may be &s;trange to us, he will be di&s;po&s;ed rather to laugh at, than
&s;ympathize with our Wonder. He cannot conceive what occa&s;ion
there is for any connecting events to unite tho&s;e appearances, which
&s;eem to him to &s;ucceed each other very naturally. It is their nature,
he tells us, to follow one another in this order, and that accordingly
they always do &s;o. In the &s;ame manner bread has, &s;ince the world
began, been the common nouri&s;hment of the human body, and men
have &s;o long &s;een it, every day, converted into fle&s;h and bones, &s;ub|&s;tances
in all re&s;pects &s;o unlike it, that they have &s;eldom had the cu|rio&s;ity
to inquire by what proce&s;s of intermediate events this change is
brought about. Becau&s;e the pa&s;&s;age of the thought from the one ob|ject
to the other is by cu&s;tom become quite &s;mooth and ea&s;y, almo&s;t
without the &s;uppo&s;ition of any &s;uch proce&s;s. Philo&s;ophers, indeed, who
often look for a chain of invi&s;ible objects to join together two events
that occur in an order familiar to all the world, have endeavoured to
find out a chain of this kind betwixt the two events I have ju&s;t
now mentioned; in the &s;ame manner as they have endeavoured, by
a like intermediate chain, to connect the gravity, the ela&s;ticity, and
even the cohe&s;ion of natural bodies, with &s;ome of their other qua|lities.
The&s;e, however, are all of them &s;uch combinations of events
as give no &s;top to the imaginations of the bulk of mankind, as ex|cite
no Wonder, nor any apprehen&s;ion that there is wanting the
&s;tricte&s;t connection between them. But as in tho&s;e &s;ounds, which
to the greater part of men &s;eem perfectly agreeable to mea&s;ure
<PB N="20" REF="113">
and harmony, the nicer ear of a mu&s;ician will di&s;cover a want,
both of the mo&s;t exact time, and of the mo&s;t perfect coincidence:
&s;o the more practi&s;ed thought of a philo&s;opher, who has &s;pent his
whole life in the &s;tudy of the connecting principles of nature, will
often feel an interval betwixt two objects, which, to more carele&s;s
ob&s;ervers, &s;eem very &s;trictly conjoined. By long attention to all the
connections which have ever been pre&s;ented to his ob&s;ervation, by
having often compared them with one another, he has, like the mu|&s;ician,
acquired, if one may &s;ay &s;o, a nicer ear, and a more delicate
feeling with regard to things of this nature. And as to the one, that
mu&s;ic &s;eems di&s;&s;onance which falls &s;hort of the mo&s;t perfect harmo|ny;
&s;o to the other, tho&s;e events &s;eem altogether &s;eparated and dis|joined,
which fall &s;hort of the &s;tricte&s;t and mo&s;t perfect connection.</P>
<P>Philo&s;ophy is the &s;cience of the connecting principles of nature.
Nature, after the large&s;t experience that common ob&s;ervation can
acquire, &s;eems to abound with events which appear &s;olitary and in|coherent
with all that go before them, which therefore di&s;turb the
ea&s;y movement of the imagination; which make its ideas &s;ucceed
each other, if one may &s;ay &s;o, by irregular &s;tarts and &s;allies; and
which thus tend, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to introduce tho&s;e confu&s;ions and
di&s;tractions we formerly mentioned. Philo&s;ophy, by repre&s;enting
the invi&s;ible chains which bind together all the&s;e disjointed objects,
endeavours to introduce order into this chaos of jarring and di&s;cord|ant
appearances, to allay this tumult of the imagination, and to re|&s;tore
it, when it &s;urveys the great revolutions of the univer&s;e, to that
tone of tranquillity and compo&s;ure, which is both mo&s;t agreeable in
it&s;elf, and mo&s;t &s;uitable to its nature. Philo&s;ophy, therefore, may
be regarded as one of tho&s;e arts which addre&s;s them&s;elves to the ima|gination;
and who&s;e theory and hi&s;tory, upon that account, fall pro|perly
within the circumference of our &s;ubject. Let us endeavour to
trace it, from its fir&s;t origin, up to that &s;ummit of perfection to which
<PB N="21" REF="114">
it is at pre&s;ent &s;uppo&s;ed to have arrived, and to which, indeed, it has
equally been &s;uppo&s;ed to have arrived in almo&s;t all former times. It
is the mo&s;t &s;ublime of all the agreeable arts, and its revolutions have
been the greate&s;t, the mo&s;t frequent, and the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed of
all tho&s;e that have happened in the literary world. Its hi&s;tory, there|fore,
mu&s;t, upon all accounts, be the mo&s;t entertaining and the mo&s;t
in&s;tructive. Let us examine, therefore, all the different &s;y&s;tems of
nature, which, in the&s;e we&s;tern parts of the world, the only parts of
who&s;e hi&s;tory we know any thing, have &s;ucce&s;&s;ively been adopted by
the learned and ingenious; and, without regarding their ab&s;urdity or
probability, their agreement or incon&s;i&s;tency with truth and reality,
let us con&s;ider them only in that particular point of view which be|longs
to our &s;ubject; and content our&s;elves with inquiring how far
each of them was fitted to &s;ooth the imagination, and to render the
theatre of nature a more coherent, and therefore a more magnificent
&s;pectacle, than otherwi&s;e it would have appeared to be. According as
they have failed or &s;ucceeded in this, they have con&s;tantly failed or
&s;ucceeded in gaining reputation and renown to their authors; and
this will be found to be the clew that is mo&s;t capable of conducting
us through all the labyrinths of philo&s;ophical hi&s;tory: for, in the
mean time, it will &s;erve to confirm what has gone before, and to
throw light upon what is to come after, that we ob&s;erve, in general,
that no &s;y&s;tem, how well &s;oever in other re&s;pects &s;upported, has ever
been able to gain any general credit on the world, who&s;e connecting
principles were not &s;uch as were familiar to all mankind. Why has
the chemical philo&s;ophy in all ages crept along in ob&s;curity, and
been &s;o di&s;regarded by the generality of mankind, while other &s;y&s;|tems,
le&s;s u&s;eful, and not more agreeable to experience, have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
univer&s;al admiration for whole centuries together? The connecting
principles of the chemical philo&s;ophy are &s;uch as the generality of
mankind know nothing about, have rarely &s;een, and have never been
acquainted with; and which to them, therefore, are incapable of
<PB N="22" REF="115">
&s;moothing the pa&s;&s;age of the imagination betwixt any two &s;eemingly
disjointed objects. Salts, &s;ulphurs, and mercuries, acids, and alkalis,
are principles which can &s;mooth things to tho&s;e only who live about
the furnace; but who&s;e mo&s;t common operations &s;eem, to the bulk
of mankind, as disjointed as any two events which the chemi&s;ts
would connect together by them. Tho&s;e arti&s;ts, however, naturally
explained things to them&s;elves by principles that were familiar to
them&s;elves. As Ari&s;totle ob&s;erves, that the early Pythagoreans, who
fir&s;t &s;tudied arithmetic, explained all things by the properties of num|bers;
and Cicero tells us, that Ari&s;toxenus, the mu&s;ician, found the
nature of the &s;oul to con&s;i&s;t in harmony. In the &s;ame manner, a
learned phy&s;ician lately gave a &s;y&s;tem of moral philo&s;ophy upon the
the principles of his own art, in which wi&s;dom and virtue were the
healthful &s;tate of the &s;oul; the different vices and follies, the differ|ent
di&s;ea&s;es to which it was &s;ubject; in which the cau&s;es and &s;ymp|toms
of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es were a&s;certained; and, in the &s;ame medical
&s;train, a proper method of cure pre&s;cribed. In the &s;ame manner
al&s;o, others have written parallels of painting and poetry, of poetry
and mu&s;ic, of mu&s;ic and architecture, of beauty and virtue, of all
the fine arts; &s;y&s;tems which have univer&s;ally owed their origin to the
lucubrations of tho&s;e who were acquainted with the one art, but ig|norant
of the other; who therefore explained to them&s;elves the phae|nomena,
in that which was &s;trange to them, by tho&s;e in that which
was familiar; and with whom, upon that account, the analogy,
which in other writers gives occa&s;ion to a few ingenious &s;imilitudes,
became the great hinge upon which every thing turned.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Origin of Philo&s;ophy.</HEAD>
<P>MANKIND, in the fir&s;t ages of &s;ociety, before the e&s;tabli&s;hment
of law, order, and &s;ecurity, have little curio&s;ity to find out
tho&s;e hidden chains of events which bind together the &s;eemingly di&s;|jointed
appearances of nature. A &s;avage, who&s;e &s;ub&s;i&s;tence is preca|rious,
who&s;e life is every day expo&s;ed to the rude&s;t dangers, has no
inclination to amu&s;e him&s;elf with &s;earching out what, when di&s;co|vered,
&s;eems to &s;erve no other purpo&s;e than to render the theatre of
nature a more connected &s;pectacle to his imagination. Many of the&s;e
&s;maller incoherences, which in the cour&s;e of things perplex philo&s;o|phers,
entirely e&s;cape his attention. Tho&s;e more magnificent irregu|larities,
who&s;e grandeur he cannot overlook, call forth his amaze|ment.
Comets, eclip&s;es, thunder, lightning, and other meteors, by
their greatne&s;s, naturally overawe him, and he views them with a
reverence that approaches to fear. His inexperience and uncertainty
with regard to every thing about them, how they came, how they
are to go, what went before, what is to come after them, exa&s;perate
his &s;entiment into terror and con&s;ternation. But our pa&s;&s;ions, as Fa|ther
Malbranche ob&s;erves, all ju&s;tify them&s;elves; that is, &s;ugge&s;t to
us opinions which ju&s;tify them. As tho&s;e appearances terrify him,
therefore, he is di&s;po&s;ed to believe every thing about them which can
render them &s;till more the objects of his terror. That they proceed
from &s;ome intelligent, though invi&s;ible cau&s;es, of who&s;e vengeance
and di&s;plea&s;ure they are either the &s;igns or the effects, is the notion
of all others mo&s;t capable of enhancing this pa&s;&s;ion, and is that,
therefore, which he is mo&s;t apt to entertain. To this too, that cow|ardice
and pu&s;illanimity, &s;o natural to man in his uncivilized &s;tate,
<PB N="24" REF="117">
&s;till more di&s;po&s;es him; unprotected by the laws of &s;ociety, expo&s;ed,
defencele&s;s, he feels his weakne&s;s upon all occa&s;ions; his &s;trength
and &s;ecurity upon none.</P>
<P>But all the irregularities of nature are not of this awful or
terrible kind. Some of them are perfectly beautiful and agreeable.
The&s;e, therefore, from the &s;ame impotence of mind, would be be|held
with love and complacency, and even with tran&s;ports of grati|tude;
for whatever is the cau&s;e of plea&s;ure naturally excites our gra|titude.
A child care&s;&s;es the fruit that is agreeable to it, as it beats
the &s;tone that hurts it. The notions of a &s;avage are not very differ|ent.
The ancient Athenians, who &s;olemnly puni&s;hed the axe which
had accidentally been the cau&s;e of the death of a man, erected altars,
and offered &s;acrifices to the rainbow. Sentiments not unlike the&s;e,
may &s;ometimes, upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, begin to be felt even in the
brea&s;ts of the mo&s;t civilized, but are pre&s;ently checked by the reflec|tion,
that the things are not their proper objects. But a &s;avage,
who&s;e notions are guided altogether by wild nature and pa&s;&s;ion,
waits for no other proof that a thing is the proper object of any &s;en|timent,
than that it excites it. The reverence and gratitude, with
which &s;ome of the appearances of nature in&s;pire him, convince him
that they are the proper objects of reverence and gratitude, and
therefore proceed from &s;ome intelligent beings, who take plea&s;ure in
the expre&s;&s;ions of tho&s;e &s;entiments. With him, therefore, every ob|ject
of nature, which by its beauty or greatne&s;s, its utility or hurt|fulne&s;s,
is con&s;iderable enough to attract his attention, and who&s;e
operations are not perfectly regular, is &s;uppo&s;ed to act by the direc|tion
of &s;ome invi&s;ible and de&s;igning power. The &s;ea is &s;pread out
into a calm, or heaved into a &s;torm, according to the good plea&s;ure
of Neptune. Does the earth pour forth an exuberant harve&s;t? It is
owing to the indulgence of Ceres. Does the vine yield a plentiful
vintage? It flows from the bounty of Bacohus. Do either refu&s;e their
<PB N="25" REF="118">
pre&s;ents? It is a&s;cribed to the di&s;plea&s;ure of tho&s;e of&s;ended deities.
The tree, which now flouri&s;hes, and now decays, is inhabited by a
Dryad, upon who&s;e health or &s;ickne&s;s its various appearances depend.
The fountain, which &s;ometimes flows in a copious, and &s;ometimes in
a &s;canty &s;tream, which appears &s;ometimes clear and limpid, and at
other times muddy and di&s;turbed, is affected in all its changes by the
Naiad who dwells within it. Hence the origin of Polythei&s;m, and
of that vulgar &s;uper&s;tition which a&s;cribes all the irregular events of
nature to the favour or di&s;plea&s;ure of intelligent, though invi&s;ible be|ings,
to gods, daemons, witches, genii, fairies. For it may be ob|&s;erved,
that in all Polythei&s;tic religions, among &s;avages, as well as in
the early ages of Heathen antiquity, it is the irregular events of na|ture
only that are a&s;cribed to the agency and power of their gods.
Fire burns, and water refre&s;hes; heavy bodies de&s;cend, and lighter
&s;ub&s;tances fly upwards, by the nece&s;&s;ity of their own nature; nor
was the invi&s;ible hand of Jupiter ever apprehended to be employed
in tho&s;e matters. But thunder and lightning, &s;torms and &s;un&s;hine,
tho&s;e more irregular events, were a&s;cribed to his favour, or his an|ger.
Man, the only de&s;igning power with which they were ac|quainted,
never acts but either to &s;top, or to alter the cour&s;e, which
natural events would take, if left to them&s;elves. Tho&s;e other intelli|gent
beings, whom they imagined, but knew not, were naturally
&s;uppo&s;ed to act in the &s;ame manner; not to employ them&s;elves in
&s;upporting the ordinary cour&s;e of things, which went on of its own
accord, but to &s;top, to thwart, and to di&s;turb it. And thus, in the
fir&s;t ages of the world, the lowe&s;t and mo&s;t pu&s;illanimous &s;uper&s;tition
&s;upplied the place of philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>But when law has e&s;tabli&s;hed order and &s;ecurity, and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence
cea&s;es to be precarious, the curio&s;ity of mankind is increa&s;ed, and
their fears are dimini&s;hed. The lei&s;ure which they then enjoy ren|ders
them more attentive to the appearances of nature, more ob&s;erv|ant
<PB N="26" REF="119">
of her &s;malle&s;t irregularities, and more de&s;irous to know what is
the chain which links them all together. That &s;ome &s;uch chain &s;ub|&s;i&s;ts
betwixt all her &s;eemingly disjointed phoenomena, they are nece&s;|&s;arily
led to conceive; and that magnanimity, and cheerfulne&s;s, which
all generous natures acquire who are bred in civilized &s;ocieties, where
they have &s;o few occa&s;ions to feel their weakne&s;s, and &s;o many to be
con&s;cious of their &s;trength and &s;ecurity, renders them le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to
employ, for this connecting chain, tho&s;e invi&s;ible beings whom the
fear and ignorance of their rude forefathers had engendered. Tho&s;e
of liberal fortunes, who&s;e attention is not much occupied either with
bu&s;ine&s;s or with plea&s;ure, can fill up the void of their imagination,
which is thus di&s;engaged from the ordinary affairs of life, no other
way than by attending to that train of events which pa&s;&s;es around
them. While the great objects of nature thus pa&s;s in review before
them, many things occur in an order to which they have not been
accu&s;tomed. Their imagination, which accompanies with ea&s;e and
delight the regular progre&s;s of nature, is &s;topped and embarra&s;&s;ed by
tho&s;e &s;eeming incoherences; they excite their wonder, and &s;eem to
require &s;ome chain of intermediate events, which, by connecting
them with &s;omething that has gone before, may thus render the
whole cour&s;e of the univer&s;e con&s;i&s;tent and of a piece. Wonder,
therefore, and not any expectation of advantage from its di&s;coveries,
is the fir&s;t principle which prompts mankind to the &s;tudy of Philo&s;o|phy,
of that &s;cience which pretends to lay open the concealed con|nections
that unite the various appearances of nature; and they pur|&s;ue
this &s;tudy for its own &s;ake, as an original plea&s;ure or good in it|&s;elf,
without regarding its tendency to procure them the means of
many other plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>Greece, and the Greek colonies in Sicily, Italy, and the Le&s;&s;er
A&s;ia, were the fir&s;t countries which, in the&s;e we&s;tern parts of the
world, arrived at a &s;tate of civilized &s;ociety. It was in them, there|fore,
<PB N="27" REF="120">
that the fir&s;t philo&s;ophers, of who&s;e doctrine we have any di&s;|tinct
account, appeared. Law and order &s;eem indeed to have been
e&s;tabli&s;hed in the great monarchies of A&s;ia and Egypt, long before
they had any footing in Greece: yet, after all that has been &s;aid con|cerning
the learning of the Chaldeans and Egyptians, whether there
ever was in tho&s;e nations any thing which de&s;erved the name of
&s;cience, or whether that de&s;poti&s;m which is more de&s;tructive of &s;e|curity
and lei&s;ure than anarchy it&s;elf, and which prevailed over all
the Ea&s;t, prevented the growth of Philo&s;ophy, is a que&s;tion which,
for want of monuments, cannot be determined with any degree of
preci&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Greek colonies having been &s;ettled amid nations either alto|gether
barbarous, or altogether unwarlike, over whom, therefore, they
&s;oon acquired a very great authority, &s;eem, upon that account, to have
arrived at a con&s;iderable degree of empire and opulence before any
&s;tate in the parent country had &s;urmounted that extreme poverty,
which, by leaving no room for any evident di&s;tinction of ranks, is
nece&s;&s;arily attended with the confu&s;ion and mi&s;rule which flows from
a want of all regular &s;ubordination. The Greek i&s;lands being &s;ecure
from the inva&s;ion of land armies, or from naval forces, which were
in tho&s;e days but little known, &s;eem, upon that account too, to have
got before the continent in all &s;orts of civility and improvement.
The fir&s;t philo&s;ophers, therefore, as well as the fir&s;t poets, &s;eem all
to have been natives, either of their colonies, or of their i&s;lands. It
was from thence that Homer, Archilochus, Ste&s;ichorus, Simonides,
Sappho, Anacreon, derived their birth. Thales and Pythagoras, the
founders of the two earlie&s;t &s;ects of philo&s;ophy, aro&s;e, the one in an
A&s;iatic colony, the other in an i&s;land; and neither of them e&s;ta|li&s;hed
his &s;chool in the mother country.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="121">
What was the particular &s;y&s;tem of either of tho&s;e two philo&s;o|phers,
or whether their doctrine was &s;o methodized as to de&s;erve the
name of a &s;y&s;tem, the imperfection, as well as the uncertainty of all
the traditions that have come down to us concerning them, makes it
impo&s;&s;ible to determine. The &s;chool of Pythagoras, however, &s;eems
to have advanced further in the &s;tudy of the connecting prin|ciples
of nature, than that of the Ionian philo&s;opher. The accounts
which are given of Anaximander, Anaximenes, Anaxagoras, Ar|chelaus,
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Thales, repre&s;ent the doctrines of tho&s;e
&s;ages as full of the mo&s;t inextricable confu&s;ion. Something, how|ever,
that approaches to a compo&s;ed and orderly &s;y&s;tem, may be
traced in what is delivered down to us concerning the doctrine of
Empedocles, of Archytas, of Timaeus, and of Ocellus the Lucanian,
the mo&s;t renowned philo&s;ophers of the Italian &s;chool. The opinions
of the two la&s;t coincide pretty much; the one, with tho&s;e of Plato;
the other, with tho&s;e of Ari&s;totle; nor do tho&s;e of the two fir&s;t &s;eem
to have been very different, of whom the one was the author of the
doctrine of the Four Elements, the other the inventor of the Cate|gories;
who, therefore, may be regarded as the founders, the one,
of the ancient Phy&s;ics; the other, of the ancient Dialectic; and, how
clo&s;ely the&s;e were connected, will appear hereafter. It was in the
&s;chool of Socrates, however, from Plato and Ari&s;totle, that Philo&s;o|phy
fir&s;t received that form, which introduced her, if one may &s;ay
&s;o, to the general acquaintance of the world. It is from them, there|fore,
that we &s;hall begin to give her hi&s;tory in any detail. What|ever
was valuable in the former &s;y&s;tems, which was at all con&s;i&s;tent
with their general principles, they &s;eem to have con&s;olidated into their
own. From the Ionian Philo&s;ophy, I have not been able to di&s;cover
that they derived any thing. From the Pythagorean &s;chool, both
Plato and Ari&s;totle &s;eem to have derived the fundamental principles
of almo&s;t all their doctrines. Plato, too, appears to have borrowed
<PB N="29" REF="122">
&s;omething from two other &s;ects of philo&s;ophers, who&s;e extreme ob|&s;curity
&s;eems to have prevented them from acquiring them&s;elves any
exten&s;ive reputation: the one was that of Cratylus and Heraclitus;
the other was that of Xenophanes, Parmenides, Meli&s;&s;us, and Zeno.
To pretend to re&s;cue the &s;y&s;tem of any of tho&s;e ante&s;ocratic &s;ages,
from that oblivion which at pre&s;ent covers them all, would be a vain
and u&s;ele&s;s attempt. What &s;eems, however, to have been borrowed
from them, &s;hall &s;ometimes be marked as we go along.</P>
<P>There was &s;till another &s;chool of philo&s;ophy, earlier than Plato,
from which, however, he was &s;o far from borrowing any thing, that
he &s;eems to have bent the whole force of his rea&s;on to di&s;credit and
expo&s;e its principles. This was the Philo&s;ophy of Leucippus, De|mocritus,
and Protagoras, which accordingly &s;eems to have &s;ubmitted
to his eloquence, to have lain dormant, and to have been almo&s;t for|gotten
for &s;ome generations, till it was afterwards more &s;ucce&s;sfully
revived by Epicurus.</P>

<HEAD>The Hi&s;tory of A&s;tronomy.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the phoenomena of nature, the cele&s;tial appearances are, by
their greatne&s;s and beauty, the mo&s;t univer&s;al objects of the cu|rio&s;ity
of mankind. Tho&s;e who &s;urveyed the heavens with the mo&s;t
carele&s;s attention, nece&s;&s;arily di&s;tingui&s;hed in them three different &s;orts
of objects; the Sun, the Moon, and the Stars. The&s;e la&s;t, appearing
always in the &s;ame &s;ituation, and at the &s;ame di&s;tance with regard to
one another, and &s;eeming to revolve every day round the earth in
parallel circles, which widened gradually from the poles to the equa|tor,
were naturally thought to have all the marks of being fixed,
<PB N="30" REF="123">
like &s;o many gems, in the concave &s;ide of the firmament, and of
being carried round by the diurnal revolutions of that &s;olid body:
for the azure &s;ky, in which the &s;tars &s;eem to float, was readily ap|prehended,
upon account of the uniformity of their apparent mo|tions,
to be a &s;olid body, the roof or outer wall of the univer&s;e, to
who&s;e in&s;ide all tho&s;e little &s;parkling objects were attached.</P>
<P>The Sun and Moon, often changing their di&s;tance and &s;ituation,
in regard to the other heavenly bodies, could not be apprehended to
be attached to the &s;ame &s;phere with them. They a&s;&s;igned, there|fore,
to each of them, a &s;phere of its own; that is, &s;uppo&s;ed each
of them to be attached to the concave &s;ide of a &s;olid and tran&s;parent
body, by who&s;e revolutions they were carried round the earth.
There was not indeed, in this ca&s;e, the &s;ame ground for the &s;uppo|&s;ition
of &s;uch a &s;phere as in that of the Fixed Stars; for neither the
Sun nor the Moon appear to keep always at the &s;ame di&s;tance with
regard to any one of the other heavenly bodies. But as the motion
of the Stars had been accounted for by an hypothe&s;is of this kind, it
rendered the theory of the heavens more uniform, to account for
that of the Sun and Moon in the &s;ame manner. The &s;phere of the
Sun they placed above that of the Moon; as the Moon was evidently
&s;een in eclip&s;es to pa&s;s betwixt the Sun and the Earth. Each of them
was &s;uppo&s;ed to revolve by a motion of its own, and at the &s;ame
time to be affected by the motion of the Fixed Stars. Thus, the Sun
was carried round from ea&s;t to we&s;t by the communicated move|ment
of this outer &s;phere, which produced his diurnal revolutions,
and the vici&s;&s;itudes of day and night; but at the &s;ame time he had
a motion of his own, contrary to this, from we&s;t to ea&s;t, which oc|ca&s;ioned
his annual revolution, and the continual &s;hifting of his
place with regard to the Fixed Stars. This motion was more ea&s;y,
they thought, when carried on edgeways, and not in direct oppo|&s;ition
to the motion of the outer &s;phere, which occa&s;ioned the in|clination
<PB N="31" REF="124">
of the axis of the &s;phere of the Sun, to that of the &s;phere
of the Fixed Stars; this again produced the obliquity of the ecliptic,
and the con&s;equent changes of the &s;ea&s;ons. The moon, being placed
below the &s;phere of the Sun, had both a &s;horter cour&s;e to fini&s;h, and
was le&s;s ob&s;tructed by the contrary movement of the &s;phere of the
Fixed Stars, from which &s;he was farther removed. She fini&s;hed her
period, therefore, in a &s;horter time, and required but a month, in|&s;tead
of a year, to complete it.</P>
<P>The Stars, when more attentively &s;urveyed, were &s;ome of them ob|&s;erved
to be le&s;s con&s;tant and uniform in their motions than the re&s;t,
and to change their &s;ituations with regard to the other heavenly
bodies; moving generally ea&s;twards, yet appearing &s;ometimes to
&s;tand &s;till, and &s;ometimes even to move we&s;twards. The&s;e, to the
number of five, were di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Planets, or
wandering Stars, and marked with the particular appellations of Sa|turn,
Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury. As, like the Sun and
Moon, they &s;eem to accompany the motion of the Fixed Stars from
ea&s;t to we&s;t, but at the &s;ame time to have a motion of their own,
which is generally from we&s;t to ea&s;t; they were each of them, as
well as tho&s;e two great lamps of heaven, apprehended to be attached
to the in&s;ide of a &s;olid concave and tran&s;parent &s;phere, which had a
revolution of its own, that was almo&s;t directly contrary to the revo|lution
of the outer heaven, but which, at the &s;ame time, was hurried
along by the &s;uperior violence and rapidity of this la&s;t.</P>
<P>This is the &s;y&s;tem of concentric Spheres, the fir&s;t regular &s;y&s;tem
of A&s;tronomy, which the world beheld, as it was taught in the Ita|lian
&s;chool before Ari&s;totle and his two cotemporary philo&s;ophers,
Eudoxus and Callippus, had given it all the perfection which it is
capable of receiving. Though rude and inartificial, it is capable of
connecting together, in the imagination, the grande&s;t and the mo&s;t
<PB N="32" REF="125">
&s;eemingly disjointed appearances in the heavens. The motions of
the mo&s;t remarkable objects in the cele&s;tial regions, the Sun, the
Moon, and the Fixed Stars, are &s;uffic ently connected with one ano|ther
by this hypothe&s;is. The eclip&s;es of the&s;e two great luminaries
are, though not &s;o ea&s;ily calculated, as ea&s;ily explained, upon this
ancient, as upon the modern &s;y&s;tem. When the&s;e early philo&s;ophers
explained to their di&s;ciples the very &s;imple cau&s;es of tho&s;e dreadful
phoenomena, it was under the &s;eal of the mo&s;t &s;acred &s;ecrecy, that
they might avoid the fury of the people, and not incur the imputa|tion
of impiety, when they thus took from the gods the direction of
tho&s;e events, which were apprehended to be the mo&s;t terrible tokens
of their impending vengeance. The obliquity of the ecliptic, the
con&s;equent changes of the &s;ea&s;ons, the vici&s;&s;itudes of day and night,
and the different lengths of both days and nights, in the different
&s;ea&s;ons, corre&s;pond too, pretty exactly, with this ancient doctrine.
And if there had been no other bodies di&s;coverable in the heavens
be&s;ides the Sun, the Moon, and the Fixed Stars, this old hypothe&s;is
might have &s;tood the examination of all ages, and have gone down
triumphant to the remote&s;t po&s;terity.</P>
<P>If it gained the belief of mankind by its plau&s;ibility, it attracted their
wonder and admiration; &s;entiments that &s;till more confirmed their
belief, by the novelty and beauty of that view of nature which it
pre&s;ented to the imagination. Before this &s;y&s;tem was taught in the
world, the earth was regarded as, what it appears to the eye, a va&s;t,
rough, and irregular plain, the ba&s;is and foundation of the univer&s;e,
&s;urrounded on all &s;ides by the ocean, and who&s;e roots extended
them&s;elves through the whole of that infinite depth which is below
it. The &s;ky was con&s;idered as a &s;olid hemi&s;phere, which covered
the earth, and united with the ocean at the extremity of the hori|zon.
The Sun, the Moon, and all the heavenly bodies ro&s;e out of
the ea&s;tern, climbed up the convex &s;ide of the heavens, and de|&s;ceended
<PB N="33" REF="126">
again into the we&s;tern ocean, and from thence, by &s;ome &s;ub|terraneous
pa&s;&s;ages, returned to their fir&s;t chambers in the ea&s;t. Nor
was this notion confined to the people, or to the poets who painted
the opinions of the people: it was held by Xenophanes, the founder
of the Eleatic philo&s;ophy, after that of the Ionian and Italian &s;chools,
the earlie&s;t that appeared in Greece. Thales of Miletus too, who,
according to Ari&s;totle, repre&s;ented the Earth as floating upon an im|men&s;e
ocean of water, may have been nearly of the &s;ame opinion;
notwith&s;tanding what we are told by Plutarch and Apuleius concern|ing
his a&s;tronomical di&s;coveries, all of which mu&s;t plainly have been
of a much later date. To tho&s;e who had no other idea of nature,
be&s;ides what they derived from &s;o confu&s;ed an account of things,
how agreeable mu&s;t that &s;y&s;tem have appeared, which repre&s;ented
the Earth as di&s;tingui&s;hed into land and water, &s;elf-balanced and &s;u&s;|pended
in the centre of the univer&s;e, &s;urrounded by the elements of
Air and Ether, and covered by eight poli&s;hed and cri&s;talline Spheres,
each of which was di&s;tingui&s;hed by one or more beautiful and lu|minous
bodies, and all of which revolved round their common
centre, by varied, but by equable and proportionable motions. It
&s;eems to have been the beauty of this &s;y&s;tem that gave Plato the
notion of &s;omething like an harmonic proportion, to be di&s;covered in
the motions and di&s;tances of the heavenly bodies; and which &s;ug|ge&s;ted
to the earlier Pythagoreans, the celebrated fancy of the Mu&s;ick
of the Spheres: a wild and romantic idea, yet &s;uch as does not ill
corre&s;pond with that admiration, which &s;o beautiful a &s;y&s;tem, recom|mended
too by the graces of novelty, is apt to in&s;pire.</P>
<P>Whatever are the defects which this account of things labours
under, they are &s;uch, as to the fir&s;t ob&s;ervers of the heavens could
not readily occur. If all the motions of the Five Planets cannot, the
greater part of them may, be ea&s;ily connected by it; they and all
their motions are the lea&s;t remarkable objects in the heavens; the
<PB N="34" REF="127">
greater part of mankind take no notice of them at all; and a &s;y&s;tem,
who&s;e only defect lies in the account which it gives of them, cannot
thereby be much di&s;graced in their opinion. If &s;ome of the appear|ances
too of the Sun and Moon, the &s;ometimes accelerated and again
retarded motions of tho&s;e luminaries but ill corre&s;pond with it;
the&s;e too, are &s;uch as cannot be di&s;covered but by the mo&s;t attentive
ob&s;ervation, and &s;uch therefore as we cannot wonder that the ima|ginations
of the fir&s;t enquirers &s;hould &s;lur over, if one may &s;ay &s;o,
and take little notice of.</P>
<P>It was, however, to remedy tho&s;e defects, that Eudoxus, the
friend and auditor of Plato, found it nece&s;&s;ary to increa&s;e the num|ber
of the Cele&s;tial Spheres. Each Planet is &s;ometimes ob&s;erved to
advance forward in that ea&s;tward cour&s;e which is peculiar to it|&s;elf,
&s;ometimes to retire backwards, and &s;ometimes again to &s;tand
&s;till. To &s;uppo&s;e that the Sphere of the Planet &s;hould by its own
motion, if one may &s;ay &s;o, &s;ometimes roll forwards, &s;ometimes roll
backwards, and &s;ometimes do neither the one nor the other, is con|trary
to all the natural propen&s;ities of the imagination, which ac|companies
with ea&s;e and delight any regular and orderly motion, but
feels it&s;elf perpetually &s;topped and interrupted, when it endeavours
to attend to one &s;o de&s;ultory and uncertain. It would pur&s;ue, na|turally
and of its own accord, the direct or progre&s;&s;ive movement
of the Sphere, but is every now and then &s;hocked, if one may &s;ay
&s;o, and turned violently out of its natural career by the retrograde
and &s;tationary appearances of the Planet, betwixt which and its
more u&s;ual motion, the fancy feels a want of connection, a gap or
interval, which it cannot fill up, but by &s;uppo&s;ing &s;ome chain of
intermediate events to join them. The hypothe&s;is of a number of
other &s;pheres revolving in the heavens, be&s;ides tho&s;e in which the
luminous bodies them&s;elves were infixed, was the chain with which
Eudoxus endeavoured to &s;upply it. He be&s;towed four of the&s;e
<PB N="35" REF="128">
Spheres upon each of the Five Planets; one in which the luminous
body it&s;elf revolved, and three others above it. Each of the&s;e had
a regular and con&s;tant, but a peculiar movement of its own, which
it communicated to what was properly the Sphere of the Planet, and
thus occa&s;ioned that diver&s;ity of motions ob&s;ervable in tho&s;e bodies.
One of the&s;e Spheres, for example, had an o&s;cillatory motion, like
the circular pendulum of a watch. As when you turn round a
watch, like a Sphere upon its axis, the pendulum will, while turned
round along with it, &s;till continue to o&s;cillate, and communicate to
whatever body is comprehended within it, both its own o&s;cillations
and the circular motion of the watch; &s;o this o&s;cillating Sphere,
being it&s;elf turned round by the motion of the Sphere above it,
communicated to the Sphere below it, that circular, as well as its
own o&s;cillatory motion; produced by the one, the daily revolutions;
by the other, the direct, &s;tationary, and retrograde appearances of
the Planet, which derived from a third Sphere that revolution by
which it performed its annual period. The motions of all the&s;e
Spheres were in them&s;elves con&s;tant and equable, &s;uch as the ima|gination
could ea&s;ily attend to and pur&s;ue, and which connected to|gether
that otherwi&s;e incoherent diver&s;ity of movements ob&s;ervable
in the Sphere of the Planet. The motions of the Sun and Moon
being more regular than tho&s;e of the Five Planets, by a&s;&s;igning three
Spheres to each of them, Eudoxus imagined he could connect together
all the diver&s;ity of movements di&s;coverable in either. The motion of
the Fixed Stars being perfectly regular, one Sphere he judged &s;uffi|cient
for them all. So that, according to this account, the whole
number of Cele&s;tial Spheres amounted to twenty-&s;even. Callippus,
though &s;omewhat younger, the cotemporary of Eudoxus, found
that even this number was not enough to connect together the va&s;t
variety of movements which he di&s;covered in tho&s;e bodies, and
therefore increa&s;ed it to thirty-four. Ari&s;totle, upon a yet more at|tentive
ob&s;ervation, found that even all the&s;e Spheres would not be
<PB N="36" REF="129">
&s;ufficient, and therefore added twenty-two more, which increa&s;ed
their number to fifty-&s;ix. Later ob&s;ervers di&s;covered &s;till new
motions, and new inequalities, in the heavens. New Spheres were
therefore &s;till to be added to the &s;y&s;tem, and &s;ome of them to be
placed even above that of the Fixed Stars. So that in the &s;ixteenth
century, when Fraco&s;torio, &s;mit with the eloquence of Plato and
Ari&s;totle, and with the regularity and harmony of their &s;y&s;tem, in
it&s;elf perfectly beautiful, though it corre&s;ponds but inaccurately with
the phaenomena, endeavoured to revive this ancient A&s;tronomy,
which had long given place to that of Ptolemy and Hipparchus, he
found it nece&s;&s;ary to multiply the number of Cele&s;tial Spheres to
&s;eventy-two; neither were all the&s;e enough.</P>
<P>This &s;y&s;tem had now become as intricate and complex as tho&s;e
appearances them&s;elves, which it had been invented to render uni|form
and coherent. The imagination, therefore, found it&s;elf but
little relieved from that embarra&s;&s;ment, into which tho&s;e appearances
had thrown it, by &s;o perplexed an account of things. Another &s;y&s;|tem,
for this rea&s;on, not long after the days of Ari&s;totle, was in|vented
by Apollonius, which was afterwards perfected by Hippar|chus,
and has &s;ince been delivered down to us by Ptolemy, the more
artificial &s;y&s;tem of Eccentric Spheres and Epicycles.</P>
<P>In this &s;y&s;tem, they fir&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed betwixt the real and ap|parent
motion of the heavenly bodies. The&s;e, they ob&s;erved, upon
account of their immen&s;e di&s;tance, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily appear to revolve
in circles concentric with the globe of the Earth, and with one ano|ther:
but that we cannot, therefore, be certain that they really revolve
in &s;uch circles, &s;ince, though they did not, they would &s;till have the
&s;ame appearance. By &s;uppo&s;ing, therefore, that the Sun and the
other Planets revolved in circles, who&s;e centres were very di&s;tant
from the centre of the Earth; that con&s;equently, in the progre&s;s of
<PB N="37" REF="130">
their revolution, they mu&s;t &s;ometimes approach nearer, and &s;ome|times
recede further from it, and mu&s;t, therefore, to its inhabitants
appear to move fa&s;ter in the one ca&s;e, and flower in the other,
tho&s;e philo&s;ophers imagined they could account for the apparently
unequal velocities of all tho&s;e bodies.</P>
<P>By &s;uppo&s;ing, that in the &s;olidity of the Sphere of each of the
Five Planets there was formed another little Sphere, called an Epi|cycle,
which revolved round its own centre, at the &s;ame time that
it was carried round the centre of the Earth by the revolution of
the great Sphere, betwixt tho&s;e concave and convex &s;ides it was
inclo&s;ed; in the &s;ame manner as we might &s;uppo&s;e a little wheel
inclo&s;ed within the outer circle of a great wheel, and which whirled
about &s;everal times upon its own axis, while its centre was carried
round the axis of the great wheel, they imagined they could ac|count
for the retrograde and &s;tationary appearances of tho&s;e mo&s;t
irregular objects in the heavens. The Planet, they &s;uppo&s;ed, was
attached to the circumference, and whirled round the centre of this
little Sphere, at the &s;ame time that it was carried round the Earth
by the movement of the great Sphere. The revolution of this
little Sphere, or Epicycle, was &s;uch, that the Planet, when in the
upper part of it; that is, when furthe&s;t off and lea&s;t &s;en&s;ible to the
eye; was carried round in the &s;ame direction with the centre of the
Epicycle, or with the Sphere in which the Epicycle was inclo&s;ed:
but when in the lower part, that is, when neare&s;t and mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible to
the eye; it was carried round in a direction contrary to that of the
centre of the Epicycle: in the &s;ame manner as every point in the
upper part of the outer circle of a coach-wheel revolves forward in
the &s;ame direction with the axis, while every point, in the lower
part, revolves backwards in a contrary direction to the axis. The
motions of the Planet, therefore, &s;urveyed from the Earth appeared
direct, when in the upper part of the Epicycle, and retrograde, when
<PB N="38" REF="131">
in the lower. When again it either de&s;cended from the upper part
to the lower, or a&s;cended from the lower to the upper, it nece&s;&s;arily
appeared &s;tationary.</P>
<P>But, though, by the eccentricity of the great Sphere, they were
thus able, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to connect together the unequal veloci|ties
of the heavenly bodies, and by the revolutions of the little
Sphere, the direct, &s;tationary, and retrograde appearances of the
Planets, there was another difficulty that &s;till remained. Neither the
Moon, nor the three superior Planets, appear always in the &s;ame
part of the heavens, when at their periods of mo&s;t retarded motion,
or when they are &s;uppo&s;ed to be at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from the
Earth. The apogeum therefore, or the point of greate&s;t di&s;tance
from the Earth, in the Spheres of each of tho&s;e bodies, mu&s;t have a
movement of its own, which may carry it &s;ucce&s;&s;ively through all
the different points of the Ecliptic. They &s;uppo&s;ed, therefore, that
while the great eccentric Sphere revolved ea&s;twards round its centre,
that its centre too revolved we&s;twards in a circle of its own, round the
centre of the Earth, and thus carried its apogeum through all the
different points of the Ecliptic.</P>
<P>But with all tho&s;e combined and perplexed circles; though the pa|trons
of this &s;y&s;tem were able to give &s;ome degree of uniformity to
the real directions of the Planets, they found it impo&s;&s;ible &s;o to adju&s;t
the velocities of tho&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed pheres to the phoenomena, as that
the revolution of any one of them, when &s;urveyed from its own
entre, &s;hould appear perfectly equable and uniform. From that
point, the only point in which the velocity of what moves in a
circle can be truly judged of, they would &s;till appear irregular and
incon&s;tant, and &s;uch as tended to embarra&s;s and confound the ima|gination.
They invented, therefore, for each of them, a new Circle,
called the Equalizing Circle, from who&s;e centre they &s;hould all appear
<PB N="39" REF="132">
perfectly equable: that is, they &s;o adju&s;ted the velocities of the&s;e
Spheres, as that, though the revolution of each of them would appear
irregular when &s;urveyed from its own centre, there &s;hould, however,
be a point comprehended within its circumference, from whence its
motions &s;hould appear to cut off, in equal times, equal portions of the
Circle, of which that point was the centre.</P>
<P>Nothing can more evidently &s;how, how much the repo&s;e and tran|quillity
of the imagination is the ultimate end of philo&s;ophy, than
the invention of this Equalizing Circle. The motions of the heavenly
bodies had appeared incon&s;tant and irregular, both in their velocities
and in their directions. They were &s;uch, therefore, as tended to em|barra&s;s
and confound the imagination, whenever it attempted to trace
them. The invention of Eccentric Spheres, of Epicycles, and of the
revolution of the centres of the Eccentric Spheres, tended to allay this
confu&s;ion, to connect together tho&s;e disjointed appearances, and to
introduce harmony and order into the mind's conception of the
movements of tho&s;e bodies. It did this, however, but imperfectly; it
introduced uniformity and coherence into their real directions. But
their velocities, when &s;urveyed from the only point in which the
velocity of what moves in a Circle can be truly judged of, the centre
of that Circle, &s;till remained, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, incon&s;tant as before;
and &s;till, therefore, embarra&s;&s;ed the imagination. The mind found
it&s;elf &s;omewhat relieved from this embarra&s;&s;ment, when it conceived,
that how irregular &s;oever the motions of each of tho&s;e Circles might
appear, when &s;urveyed from its own centre, there was, however, in
each of them, a point, from whence its revolution would appear per|fectly
equable and uniform, and &s;uch as the imagination could ea&s;ily
follow. Tho&s;e philo&s;ophers tran&s;ported them&s;elves, in fancy, to the
centres of the&s;e imaginary Circles, and took plea&s;ure in &s;urveying
from thence, all tho&s;e fanta&s;tical motions, arranged, according to that
harmony and order, which it had been the end of all their re&s;earches
<PB N="40" REF="133">
to be&s;tow upon them. Here, at la&s;t, they enjoyed that tranquillity
and repo&s;e which they had pur&s;ued through all the mazes of this in|tricate
hypothe&s;is; and here they beheld this, the mo&s;t beautiful and
magnificent part of the great theatre of nature, &s;o di&s;po&s;ed and con|&s;tructed,
that they could attend, with ea&s;e and delight, to all the re|volutions
and changes that occurred in it.</P>
<P>The&s;e, the Sy&s;tem of Concentric, and that of Eccentric Spheres,
&s;eem to have been the two Sy&s;tems of A&s;tronomy, that had mo&s;t cre|dit
and reputation with that part of the ancient world, who applied
them&s;elves particularly to the &s;tudy of the heavens. Cleanthes, how|ever,
and the other philo&s;ophers of the Stoical &s;ect who came after
him, appear to have had a &s;y&s;tem of their own, quite different from
either. But, though ju&s;tly renowned for their &s;kill in dialectic, and
for the &s;ecurity and &s;ublimity of their moral doctrines, tho&s;e &s;ages
&s;eem never to have had any high reputation for their knowledge of
the heavens; neither is the name of any one of them ever counted
in the catalogue of the great a&s;tronomers, and &s;tudious ob&s;ervers of
the Stars, among the ancients. They rejected the doctrine of the
Solid Spheres; and maintained, that the cele&s;tial regions were filled
with a fluid ether, of too yielding a nature to carry along with it, by
any motion of its own, bodies &s;o immen&s;ely great as the Sun, Moon,
and Five Planets. The&s;e, therefore, as well as the Fixed Stars, did
not derive their motion from the circumambient body, but had each
of them, in it&s;elf, and peculiar to it&s;elf, a vital principle of motion,
which directed it to move with its own peculiar velocity, and its own
peculiar direction. It was by this internal principle, that the Fixed
Stars revolved directly from ea&s;t to we&s;t in circles parallel to the Equa|tor,
greater or le&s;s, according to their di&s;tance or nearne&s;s to the Poles,
and with velocities &s;o proportioned, that each of them fini&s;hed its
diurnal period in the &s;ame time, in &s;omething le&s;s than twenty-three
hours and fifty-&s;ix minutes. It was, by a principle of the &s;ame kind,
<PB N="41" REF="134">
that the Sun moved we&s;twards, for they allowed of no ea&s;tward mo|tion
in the heavens, but with le&s;s velocity than the Fixed Stars, &s;o as
to fini&s;h his diurnal period in twenty-four hours, and, con&s;equently,
to fall every day behind them, by a &s;pace of the heavens nearly
equal to that which he pa&s;&s;es over in four minutes; that is, nearly
equal to a degree. This revolution of the Sun, too, was neither di|rectly
we&s;twards, nor exactly circular; but after the Summer Sol&s;tice,
his motion began gradually to incline a little &s;outhwards, appearing
in his meridian to-day, further &s;outh than ye&s;terday; and to-morrow
&s;till further &s;outh than to-day; and thus continuing every day
to de&s;cribe a &s;piral line round the Earth, which carried him
gradually further and further &s;outhwards, till he arrived at the Win|ter
Sol&s;tice. Here, this &s;piral line began to change its direction, and
to bring him gradually, every day, further and further northwards,
till it again re&s;tored him to the Summer Sol&s;tice. In the &s;ame man|ner
they accounted for the motion of the Moon, and that of the Five
Planets, by &s;uppo&s;ing that each of them revolved we&s;twards, but with
directions, and velocities, that were both different from one another,
and continually varying; generally, however, in &s;pherical lines,
&s;omewhat inclined to the Equator.</P>
<P>This &s;y&s;tem &s;eems never to have had the vogue. The &s;y&s;tem of
Concentric as well as that of Eccentric Spheres gives &s;ome &s;ort of
rea&s;on, both for the con&s;tancy and equability of the motion of the
Fixed Stars, and for the variety and uncertainty of that of the Pla|nets.
Each of them be&s;tow &s;ome &s;ort of coherence upon tho&s;e appa|rently
disjointed phoenomena. But this other &s;y&s;tem &s;eems to leave
them pretty much as it found them. A&s;k a Stoic, why all the Fixed
Stars perform their daily revolutions in circles parallel to each other,
though of very different diameters, and with velocities &s;o propor|tioned,
that they all fini&s;h their period at the &s;ame time, and through
the whole cour&s;e of it pre&s;erve the &s;ame di&s;tance and &s;ituation with
<PB N="42" REF="135">
regard to one another? He can give no other an&s;wer, but that the
peculiar nature, or if one may &s;ay &s;o, the caprice of each Star directs
it to move in that peculiar manner. His &s;y&s;tem affords him no prin|ciple
of connection, by which he can join together, in his imagina|tion,
&s;o great a number of harmonious revolutions. But either of
the other two &s;y&s;tems, by the &s;uppo&s;ition of the &s;olid firmament,
affords this ea&s;ily. He is equally at a lo&s;s to connect together the
peculiarities that are ob&s;erved in the motions of the other heavenly
bodies; the &s;piral motion of them all; their alternate progre&s;&s;ion from
north to &s;outh, and from &s;outh to north; the &s;ometimes accelerated,
and again retarded motions of the Sun and Moon; the direct re|trograde
and &s;tationary appearances of the Planets. All the&s;e have,
in his &s;y&s;tem, no bond of union, but remain as loo&s;e and incoherent
in the fancy, as they at fir&s;t appeared to the &s;en&s;es, before philo&s;o|phy
had attempted, by giving them a new arrangement, by placing
them at different di&s;tances, by a&s;&s;igning to each &s;ome peculiar but
regular principle of motion, to methodize and di&s;po&s;e them into an
order that &s;hould enable the imagination to pa&s;s as &s;moothly, and
with as little embarra&s;&s;ment, along them, as along the mo&s;t regular,
familiar, and coherent appearances of nature.</P>
<P>Such were the &s;y&s;tems of A&s;tronomy that, in the ancient world,
appear to have been adopted by any con&s;iderable party. Of all of
them, the &s;y&s;tem of Eccentric Spheres was that which corre&s;ponded
mo&s;t exactly with the appearances of the heavens. It was not in|vented
till after tho&s;e appearances had been ob&s;erved, with &s;ome ac|curacy,
for more than a century together; and it was not completely
dige&s;ted by Ptolemy till the reign of Antoninus, after a much longer
cour&s;e of ob&s;ervations. We cannot wonder, therefore, that it was
adapted to a much greater number of the phoenomena, than either of
the other two &s;y&s;tems, which had been formed before tho&s;e phoeno|mena
were ob&s;erved with any degree of attention, which, there|fore,
<PB N="43" REF="136">
could connect them together only while they were thus re|garded
in the gro&s;s, but which, it could not be expected, &s;hould ap|ply
to them when they came to be con&s;idered in the detail. From
the time of Hipparchus, therefore, this &s;y&s;tem &s;eems to have been
pretty generally received by all tho&s;e who attended particularly to
the &s;tudy of the heavens. That a&s;tronomer fir&s;t made a catalogue
of the Fixed Stars; calculated, for &s;ix hundred years, the revolutions
of the Sun, Moon, and Five Planets; marked the places in the hea|vens,
in which, during all that period, each of tho&s;e bodies &s;hould
appear; a&s;certained the times of the eclip&s;es of the Sun and Moon,
and the particular places of the Earth in which they &s;hould be vi&s;ible.
His calculations were founded upon this &s;y&s;tem, and as the events
corre&s;ponded to his predictions, with a degree of accuracy which,
though inferior to what A&s;tronomy has &s;ince arrived at, was greatly
&s;uperior to any thing which the world had then known, they a&s;|certained,
to all a&s;tronomers and mathematicians, the preference of
his &s;y&s;tem, above all tho&s;e which had been current before it.</P>
<P>It was, however, to a&s;tronomers and mathematicians only, that
they a&s;certained this; for, notwith&s;tanding the evident &s;uperiority of
this &s;y&s;tem, to all tho&s;e with which the world was then acquainted,
it was never adopted by any one &s;ect of philo&s;ophers.</P>
<P>Philo&s;ophers, long before the days of Hipparchus, &s;eem to have
abandoned the &s;tudy of nature, to employ them&s;elves chiefly in
ethical, rhetorical, and dialectical que&s;tions. Each party of them
too, had by this time completed their peculiar &s;y&s;tem or theory of
the univer&s;e, and no human con&s;ideration could then have induced
them to give up any part of it. That &s;upercilious and ignorant con|tempt
too, with which at this time they regarded all mathematicians,
among whom they counted a&s;tronomers, &s;eems even to have hin|dered
them from enquiring &s;o far into their doctrines, as to know
<PB N="44" REF="137">
what opinions they held. Neither Cicero nor Seneca, who have &s;o
often occa&s;ion to mention the ancient &s;y&s;tems of A&s;tronomy, take
any notice of that of Hipparchus. His name is not to be found in
the writings of Seneca. It is mentioned but once in tho&s;e of Cicero,
in a letter to Atticus, but without any note of approbation, as a
geographer, and not as an a&s;tronomer. Plutarch, when he counts up,
in his &s;econd book, concerning the opinions of philo&s;ophers, all the
ancient &s;y&s;tems of A&s;tronomy, never mentions this, the only tolera|ble
one which was known in his time. Tho&s;e three authors, it
&s;eems, conver&s;ed only with the writings of philo&s;ophers. The elder
Pliny indeed, a man who&s;e curio&s;ity extended it&s;elf equally to every
part of learning, de&s;cribes the &s;y&s;tem of Hipparchus, and never men|tions
its author, which he has occa&s;ion to do often, without &s;ome note
of that high admiration which he had &s;o ju&s;tly conceived for his
merit. Such profound ignorance in tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ed in&s;tructors of
mankind, with regard to &s;o important a part of the learning of their
own times, is &s;o very remarkable, that I thought it de&s;erved to be
taken notice of, even in this &s;hort account of the revolutions of
philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>Sy&s;tems in many re&s;pects re&s;emble machines. A machine is a
little &s;y&s;tem, created to perform, as well as to connect together, in
reality, tho&s;e different movements and effects which the arti&s;t has
occa&s;ion for. A &s;y&s;tem is an imaginary machine invented to connect
together in the fancy tho&s;e different movements and effects which
are already in reality performed. The machines that are fir&s;t in|vented
to perform any particular movement are always the mo&s;t
complex, and &s;ucceeding arti&s;ts generally di&s;cover that, with fewer
wheels, with fewer principles of motion, than had originally been
employed, the &s;ame effects may be more ea&s;ily produced. The fir&s;t
&s;y&s;tems, in the &s;ame manner, are always the mo&s;t complex, and a
particular connecting chain, or principle, is generally thought nece&s;|&s;ary
<PB N="45" REF="138">
to unite every two &s;eemingly disjointed appearances: but it often
happens, that one great connecting principle is afterwards found to
be &s;ufficient to bind together all the di&s;cordant phoenomena that oc|cur
in a whole &s;pecies of things. How many wheels are nece&s;&s;ary to
carry on the movements of this imaginary machine, the &s;y&s;tem of
Eccentric Spheres! The we&s;tward diurnal revolution of the Firma|ment,
who&s;e rapidity carries all the other heavenly bodies along with
it, requires one. The periodical ea&s;tward revolutions of the Sun,
Moon, and Five Planets, require, for each of tho&s;e bodies, another.
Their differently accelerated and retarded motions require, that tho&s;e
wheels, or circles, &s;hould neither be concentric with the Firmament,
nor with one another; which, more than any thing, &s;eems to di&s;|turb
the harmony of the univer&s;e. The retrograde and &s;tationary ap|pearance
of the Five Planets, as well as the extreme incon&s;tancy of
the Moon's motion, require, for each of them, an Epicycle, another
little wheel attached to the circumference of the great wheel, which
&s;till more interrupts the uniformity of the &s;y&s;tem. The motion of
the apogeum of each of tho&s;e bodies requires, in each of them, &s;till
another wheel, to carry the centres of their Eccentric Spheres round
the centre of the Earth. And thus, this imaginary machine, though,
perhaps, more &s;imple, and certainly better adapted to the phoenomena
than the Fifty-&s;ix Planetary Spheres of Ari&s;totle, was &s;till too intri|cate
and complex for the imagination to re&s;t in it with complete
tranquillity and &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>It maintained its authority, however, without any diminution of
reputation, as long as &s;cience was at all regarded in the ancient world.
After the reign of Antoninus, and, indeed, after the age of Hippar|chus,
who lived almo&s;t three hundred years before Antoninus, the
great reputation which the earlier philo&s;ophers had acquired, &s;o im|po&s;ed
upon the imaginations of mankind, that they &s;eem to have
de&s;paired of ever equalling their renown. All human wi&s;dom, they
<PB N="46" REF="139">
&s;uppo&s;ed, was comprehended in the writings of tho&s;e elder &s;ages.
To abridge, to explain, and to comment upon them, and thus &s;how
them&s;elves, at lea&s;t, capable of under&s;tanding &s;ome of their &s;ublime
my&s;teries, became now the only probable road to reputation. Pro|clus
and Theon wrote commentaries upon the System of Ptolemy;
but, to have attempted to invent a new one, would then have been
regarded, not only as pre&s;umption, but as impiety to the memory of
their &s;o much revered predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>The ruin of the empire of the Romans, and, along with it, the
&s;ubver&s;ion of all law and order, which happened a few centuries
afterwards, produced the entire neglect of that &s;tudy of the connect|ing
principles of nature, to which lei&s;ure and &s;ecurity can alone give
occa&s;ion. After the fall of tho&s;e great conquerors and civilizers of
mankind, the empire of the Califfs &s;eems to have been the fir&s;t &s;tate
under which the world enjoyed that degree of tranquillity which the
cultivation of the &s;ciences requires. It was under the protection of
tho&s;e generous and magnificent princes, that the ancient philo&s;ophy
and a&s;tronomy of the Greeks were re&s;tored and e&s;tabli&s;hed in the
Ea&s;t; that tranquillity, which their mild, ju&s;t, and religious govern|ment
diffu&s;ed over their va&s;t empire, revived the curio&s;ity of man|kind,
to inquire into the connecting principles of nature. The fame
of the Greek and Roman learning, which was then recent in the
memories of men, made them de&s;ire to know, concerning the&s;e
ab&s;tru&s;e &s;ubjects, what were the doctrines of the &s;o much renowned
&s;ages of tho&s;e two nations.</P>
<P>They tran&s;lated, therefore, into the Arabian language, and &s;tudied,
with great eagerne&s;s, the works of many Greek philo&s;ophers, par|ticularly
of Ari&s;totle, Ptolemy, Hippocrates, and Galen. The &s;u|periority
which they ea&s;ily di&s;covered in them, above the rude e&s;&s;ays
which their own nation had yet had time to produce, and which were
<PB N="47" REF="140">
such, we may suppo&s;e, as ari&s;e every where in the fir&s;t infancy of
&s;cience, nece&s;&s;arily determined them to embrace their &s;y&s;tems, parti|cularly
that of A&s;tronomy: neither were they ever afterwards able
to throw off their authority. For, though the munificence of the
Aba&s;&s;ides, the &s;econd race of the Califfs, is &s;aid to have &s;upplied the
Arabian a&s;tronomers with larger and better in&s;truments, than any that
were known to Ptolemy and Hipparchus, the &s;tudy of the &s;ciences
&s;eems, in that mighty empire, to have been either of too &s;hort, or too
interrupted a continuance, to allow them to make any con&s;iderable
correction in the doctrines of tho&s;e old mathematicians. The ima|ginations
of mankind had not yet got time to grow &s;o familiar with
the ancient &s;y&s;tems, as to regard them without &s;ome degree of that
a&s;toni&s;hment which their grandeur and novelty excited; a novelty of
a peculiar kind, which had at once the grace of what was new, and
the authority of what was ancient. They were &s;till, therefore, too
much en&s;laved to tho&s;e &s;y&s;tems, to dare to depart from them, when
tho&s;e confu&s;ions which &s;hook, and at la&s;t overturned the peaceful
throne of the Califfs, bani&s;hed the &s;tudy of the &s;ciences from that
empire. They had, however, before this, made &s;ome con&s;iderable
improvements: they had mea&s;ured the obliquity of the Ecliptic, with
more accuracy than had been done before. The tables of Ptolemy
had, by the length of time, and by the inaccuracy of the ob&s;erva|tions
upon which they were founded, become altogether wide of
what was the real &s;ituation of the heavenly bodies, as he him&s;elf
indeed had foretold they would do. It became nece&s;&s;ary, there|fore,
to form new ones, which was accordingly executed by the
orders of the Califf Almamon, under whom, too, was made the
fir&s;t men&s;uration of the Earth that we know of, after the com|mencement
of the Chri&s;tian Aera, by two Arabian a&s;tronomers,
who, in the plain of Sennaar, mea&s;ured two degrees of its cir|cumference.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="141">
The victorious arms of the Saracens carried into Spain the learn|ing,
as well as the gallantry, of the Ea&s;t; and along with it, the tables
of Almamon, and the Arabian tran&s;lations of Ptolemy and Ari&s;totle;
and thus Europe received a &s;econd time, from Babylon, the rudi|ments
of the &s;cience of the heavens. The writings of Ptolemy were
tran&s;lated from Arabic into Latin; and the Peripatetic philo&s;ophy was
&s;tudied in Averroes and Avicenna with as much eagerne&s;s, and with
as much &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to its doctrines in the We&s;t, as it had been in
the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>The doctrine of the Solid Spheres had, originally, been invented,
in order to give a phy&s;ical account of the revolutions of the heavenly
bodies, according to the &s;y&s;tem of Concentric Circles, to which that
doctrine was very ea&s;ily accommodated. Tho&s;e mathematicians who
invented the doctrine of Eccentric Circles and Epicycles, contented
them&s;elves with &s;howing, how, by &s;uppo&s;ing the heavenly bodies to
revolve in &s;uch orbits, the phoenomena might be connected together,
and &s;ome &s;ort of uniformity and coherence be be&s;towed upon their
real motions. The phy&s;ical cau&s;es of tho&s;e motions they left to the
con&s;ideration of the philo&s;ophers; though, as appears from &s;ome
pa&s;&s;ages of Ptolemy, they had &s;ome general apprehen&s;ion, that they
were to be explained by a like hypothe&s;is. But, though the &s;y&s;tem
of Hipparchus was adopted by all aftronomers and mathematicians,
it never was received, as we have already ob&s;erved, by any one &s;ect
of philo&s;ophers among the ancients. No attempt, therefore, &s;eems
to have been made among&s;t them, to accommodate to it any &s;uch
hypothe&s;is.</P>
<P>The &s;choolmen, who received, at once, from the Arabians, the
philo&s;ophy of Ari&s;totle, and the a&s;tronomy of Hipparchus, were
nece&s;&s;arily obliged to reconcile them to one another, and to connect
<PB N="49" REF="142">
together the revolutions of the Eccentric Circles and Epicycles
of the one, by the &s;olid Spheres of the other. Many different at|tempts
of this kind were made by many different philo&s;ophers: but,
of them all, that of Purbach, in the fifteenth century, was the hap|pie&s;t
and the mo&s;t e&s;teemed. Though his hypothe&s;is is the &s;imple&s;t
of any of them, it would be in vain to de&s;cribe it without a &s;cheme;
neither is it ea&s;ily intelligible with one: for, if the &s;y&s;tem of Eccen|tric
Circles and Epicycles was before too perplexed and intricate for
the imagination to re&s;t in it, with complete tranquillity and &s;atisfac|tion,
it became much more &s;o, when this addition had been made to
it. The world, ju&s;tly indeed, applauded the ingenuity of that phi|lo&s;opher,
who could unite, &s;o happily, two &s;uch &s;eemingly incon|&s;i&s;tent
&s;y&s;tems. His labours, however, &s;eem rather to have increa&s;ed
than to have dimini&s;hed the cau&s;es of that di&s;&s;atisfaction, which the
learned &s;oon began to feel with the &s;y&s;tem of Ptolemy. He, as well
as all tho&s;e who had worked upon the &s;ame plan before him, by ren|dering
this account of things more complex, rendered it &s;till more
embarra&s;&s;ing than it had been before.</P>
<P>Neither was the complexne&s;s of this &s;y&s;tem the &s;ole cau&s;e of the
di&s;&s;atisfaction, which the world in general began, &s;oon after the days
of Purbach, to expre&s;s for it. The tables of Ptolemy having, upon
account of the inaccuracy of the ob&s;ervations on which they were
founded, become altogether wide of the real &s;ituation of the hea|venly
bodies, tho&s;e of Almamon, in the ninth century, were, upon
the &s;ame hypothe&s;is, compo&s;ed to correct their deviations. The&s;e
again, a few ages afterwards, became, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, equally
u&s;ele&s;s. In the thirteenth century, Alphon&s;us, the philo&s;ophical
king of Ca&s;tile, found it nece&s;&s;ary to give orders for the compo&s;ition
of tho&s;e tables, which bear his name. It is he, who is &s;o well known
for the whim&s;ical impicty of u&s;ing to &s;ay, that, had he been con|&s;ulted
at the creation of the univer&s;e, he could have given good ad|vice;
<PB N="50" REF="143">
an apophthegm which is &s;uppo&s;ed to have proceeded from his
di&s;like to the intricate &s;y&s;tem of Ptolemy. In the fifteenth century,
the deviation of the Alphon&s;ine tables began to be as &s;en&s;ible, as tho&s;e
of Ptolemy and Almamon had been before. It appeared evident,
therefore, that, though the &s;y&s;tem of Ptolemy might, in the main,
be true, certain corrections were nece&s;&s;ary to be made in it before it
could be brought to corre&s;pond with exact preci&s;ion to the phoeno|mena.
For the revolution of his Eccentric Circles and Epicycles,
&s;uppo&s;ing them to exi&s;t, could not, it was evident, be preci&s;ely &s;uch
as he repre&s;ented them; &s;ince the revolutions of the heavenly bodies
deviated, in a &s;hort time, &s;o widely from what the mo&s;t exact calcu|lations,
that were founded upon his hypothe&s;is, repre&s;ented them.
It had plainly, therefore, become nece&s;&s;ary to correct, by more ac|curate
ob&s;ervations, both the velocities and directions of all the wheels
and circles of which his hypothe&s;is is compo&s;ed. This, accordingly,
was begun by Purbach, and carried on by Regiomontanus, the di&s;|ciple,
the continuator, and the perfecter of the &s;y&s;tem of Purbach;
and one, who&s;e untimely death, amid&s;t innumerable projects for the
recovery of old, and the invention and advancement of new &s;ciences,
is, even at this day, to be regretted.</P>
<P>When you have convinced the world, that an e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;y&s;tem,
ought to be corrected, it is not very difficult to per&s;uade them that
it &s;hould be de&s;troyed. Not long, therefore, after the death of
Regiomontanus, Copernicus began to meditate a new &s;y&s;tem, which
&s;hould connect together the cele&s;tial appearances, in a more &s;imple as
well as a more accurate manner, than that of Ptolemy.</P>
<P>The confu&s;ion, in which the old hypothe&s;is repre&s;ented the mo|tions
of the heavenly bodies, was, he tells us, what fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted
to him the de&s;ign of forming a new &s;y&s;tem, that the&s;e, the noble&s;t
works of nature, might no longer appear devoid of that harmony
and proportion which di&s;cover them&s;elves in her meane&s;t produc|tions.
<PB N="51" REF="144">
What mo&s;t of all di&s;&s;atisfied him, was, the notion of the
Equalizing Circle, which, by repre&s;enting the revolutions of the Ce|le&s;tial
Spheres, as equable only, when &s;urveyed from a point that was
different from their centers, introduced a real inequality into their
motions; contrary to that mo&s;t natural, and indeed fundamental
idea, with which all the authors of a&s;tronomical &s;y&s;tems, Plato, Eu|doxus,
Ari&s;totle, even Hipparchus and Ptolemy them&s;elves, had hi|therto
&s;et out, that the real motions of &s;uch beautiful and divine ob|jects
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be perfectly regular, and go on, in a manner,
as agreeable to the imagination, as the objects them&s;elves are to the
&s;en&s;es. He began to con&s;ider, therefore, whether, by &s;uppo&s;ing the
heavenly bodies to be arranged in a different order from that in which
Ari&s;totle and Hipparchus had placed them, this &s;o much &s;ought for
uniformity might not be be&s;towed upon their motions. To di&s;cover
this arrangement, he examined all the ob&s;cure traditions delivered
down to us, concerning every other hypothe&s;is which the ancients
had invented, for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. He found, in Plutarch, that
&s;ome old Pythagoreans had repre&s;ented the Earth as revolving in the
centre of the univer&s;e, like a wheel round its own axis; and that
others, of the &s;ame &s;ect, had removed it from the centre, and repre|&s;ented
it as revolving in the Ecliptic like a &s;tar round the central fire.
By this central fire, he &s;uppo&s;ed they meant the Sun; and though
in this he was very widely mi&s;taken, it was, it &s;eems, upon this in|terpretation,
that he began to con&s;ider how &s;uch an hypothe&s;is might
be made to corre&s;pond to the appearances. The &s;uppo&s;ed authority
of tho&s;e old philo&s;ophers, if it did not originally &s;ugge&s;t to him his
&s;y&s;tem, &s;eems, at lea&s;t, to have confirmed him in an opinion, which,
it is not improbable, that he had before-hand other rea&s;ons for em|bracing,
notwith&s;tanding what he him&s;elf would affirm to the con|trary.</P>
<P>It
then occurred to him, that, if the Earth was &s;uppo&s;ed to revolve
every day round its axis, from we&s;t to ea&s;t, all the heavenly bodies
<PB N="52" REF="145">
would appear to revolve, in a contrary direction, from ea&s;t to we&s;t.
The diurnal revolution of the heavens, upon this hypothe&s;is, might
be only apparent; the firmament, which has no other &s;en&s;ible mo|tion,
might be perfectly at re&s;t; while the Sun, the Moon, and the
Five Planets, might have no other movement be&s;ide that ea&s;tward re|volution,
which is peculiar to them&s;elves. That, by &s;uppo&s;ing the
Earth to revolve with the Planets, round the Sun, in an orbit, which
comprehended within it the orbits of Venus and Mercury, but was
comprehended within tho&s;e of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, he could,
without the embarra&s;&s;ment of Epicycles, connect together the appa|rent
annual revolutions of the Sun, and the direct, retrograde, and
&s;tationary appearances of the Planets: that while the Earth really re|volved
round the Sun on one &s;ide of the heavens, the Sun would ap|pear
to revolve round the Earth on the other; that while &s;he really
advanced in her annual cour&s;e, he would appear to advance ea&s;tward
in that movement which is peculiar to him&s;elf. That, by &s;uppo&s;ing
the axis of the Earth to be always parallel to it&s;elf, not to be quite
perpendicular, but &s;omewhat inclined to the plane of her orbit, and
con&s;equently to pre&s;ent to the Sun, the one pole when on the one
&s;ide of him, and the other when on the other, he would account
for the obliquity of the Ecliptic; the Sun's &s;eemingly alternate pro|gre&s;&s;ion
from north to &s;outh, and from &s;outh to north, the con&s;e|quent
change of the &s;ea&s;ons, and different lengths of days and nights
in the different &s;ea&s;ons.</P>
<P>If this new hypothe&s;is thus connected together all the&s;e appear|ances
as happily as that of Ptolemy, there were others which it con|nected
together much better. The three &s;uperior Planets, when
nearly in conjunction with the Sun, appear always at the greate&s;t
di&s;tance from the Earth, are &s;malle&s;t, and lea&s;t &s;en&s;ible to the eye,
and &s;eem to revolve forward in their direct motion with the greate&s;t
rapidity. On the contrary, when in oppo&s;ition to the Sun, that is,
when in their meridian about midnight, they appear neare&s;t the
<PB N="53" REF="146">
Earth, are large&s;t, and mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible to the eye, and &s;eem to revolve
backwards in their retrograde motion. To explain the&s;e appear|ances,
the &s;y&s;tem of Ptolemy &s;uppo&s;ed each of the&s;e Planets to be at
the upper part of their &s;everal Epicycles, in the one ca&s;e; and at the
lower, in the other. But it afforded no &s;atisfactory principle of con|nection,
which could lead the mind ea&s;ily to conceive how the Epi|cycles
of tho&s;e Planets, who&s;e &s;pheres were &s;o di&s;tant from the
&s;phere of the Sun, &s;hould thus, if one may &s;ay &s;o, keep time to
his motion. The &s;y&s;tem of Copernicus afforded this ea&s;ily, and like
a more &s;imple machine, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Epicycles, con|nected
together, by fewer movements, the complex appearances of
the heavens. When the &s;uperior Planets appear nearly in conjunction
with the Sun, they are then in the &s;ide of their orbits, which is al|mo&s;t
oppo&s;ite to, and mo&s;t di&s;tant from the Earth, and therefore ap|pear
&s;malle&s;t, and lea&s;t &s;en&s;ible to the eye. But, as they then re|volve
in a direction which is almo&s;t contrary to that of the Earth,
they appear to advance forward with double velocity; as a &s;hip, that
fails in a contrary direction to another, appears from, that other, to
&s;ail both with its own velocity, and the velocity of that from which
it is &s;een. On the contrary, when tho&s;e Planets are in oppo&s;ition to
the Sun, they are on the &s;ame &s;ide of the Sun with the Earth, are
neare&s;t it, mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible to the eye, and revolve in the &s;ame direction
with it; but, as their revolutions round the Sun are flower than that
of the Earth, they are nece&s;&s;arily left behind by it, and therefore
&s;eem to revolve backwards; as a &s;hip which &s;ails &s;lower than ano|ther,
though it &s;ails in the &s;ame direction, appears from that other to
fail backwards. After the &s;ame manner, by the &s;ame annual revolu|tion
of the Earth, he connected together the direct and retrograde
motions of the two inferior Planets, as well as the &s;tationary appear|ances
of all the Five.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome other particular phoenomena of the two inferior
Planets, which corre&s;pond &s;till better to this &s;y&s;tem, and &s;till wor&s;e
<PB N="54" REF="147">
to that of Ptolemy. Venus and Mercury &s;eem to attend con&s;tantly
upon the motion of the Sun, appearing, &s;ometimes on the one &s;ide,
and &s;ometimes on the other, of that great luminary; Mercury being
almo&s;t always buried in his rays, and Venus never receding above
forty-eight degrees from him, contrary to what is ob&s;erved in the
other three Planets, which are often &s;een in the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the
heavens, at the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible di&s;tance from the Sun. The &s;y&s;tem
of Ptolemy accounted for this, by &s;uppo&s;ing that the centers of the
Epicycles of the&s;e two Planets were always in the &s;ame line with
tho&s;e of the Sun and the Earth; that they appeared therefore in con|junction
with the Sun, when either in the upper or lower part of
their Epicycles, and at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from him, when in the
&s;ides of them. It a&s;&s;igned, however, no rea&s;on why the Epicycles
of the&s;e two Planets &s;hould ob&s;erve &s;o different a rule from that which
takes place in tho&s;e of the other three, nor for the enormous Epi|cycle
of Venus, who&s;e &s;ides mu&s;t have been forty-eight degrees di&s;|tant
from the Sun, while its center was in conjunction with him,
and who&s;e diameter mu&s;t have covered more than a quadrant of the
Great Circle. But how ea&s;ily all the&s;e appearances coincide with the
hypothe&s;is, which repre&s;ents tho&s;e two inferior Planets revolving
round the Sun in orbits comprehended within the orbit of the Earth,
is too obvious to require an explanation.</P>
<P>Thus far did this new account of things render the appearances of
the heavens more completely coherent than had been done by any of
the former &s;y&s;tems. It did this, too, by a more &s;imple and intelli|gible,
as well as more beautiful machinery. It repre&s;ented the Sun,
the great enlightener of the univer&s;e, who&s;e body was alone larger
than all the Planets taken together, as e&s;tabli&s;hed immoveable in the
center, &s;hedding light and heat on all the worlds that circulated
around him in one uniform direction, but in longer or &s;horter pe|riods,
according to their different di&s;tances. It took away the diur|nal
revolution of the firmament, who&s;e rapidity, upon the old hy|pothe&s;is,
<PB N="55" REF="148">
was beyond what even thought could conceive. It not only
delivered the imagination from the embarra&s;&s;ment of Epicycles, but
from the difficulty of conceiving the&s;e two oppo&s;ite motions going
on at the &s;ame time, which the &s;y&s;tem of Ptolemy and Ari&s;totle be|&s;towed
upon all the Planets; I mean, their diurnal we&s;tward, and
periodical ea&s;tward revolutions. The Earth's revolution round its
own axis took away the nece&s;&s;ity for &s;uppo&s;ing the fir&s;t, and the &s;e|cond
was ea&s;ily conceived when by it&s;elf. The Five Planets, which
&s;eem, upon all other &s;y&s;tems, to be objects of a &s;pecies by them|&s;elves,
unlike to every thing to which the imagination has been ac|cu&s;tomed,
when &s;uppo&s;ed to revolve along with the Earth round
the Sun, were naturally apprehended to be objects of the &s;ame
kind with the Earth, habitable, opaque, and enlightened only
by the rays of the Sun. And thus this hypothe&s;is, by cla&s;&s;ing
them in the &s;ame &s;pecies of things, with an object that is of all
others the mo&s;t familiar to us, took off that wonder and uncertainty
which the &s;trangene&s;s and &s;ingularity of their appearance had ex|cited;
and thus far, too, better an&s;wered the great end of Philo|&s;ophy.</P>
<P>Neither
did the beauty and &s;implicity of this &s;y&s;tem alone recom|mend
it to the imagination; the novelty and unexpectedne&s;s of that
view of nature, which it opened to the fancy, excited more wonder
and &s;urpri&s;e than the &s;trange&s;t of tho&s;e appearances, which it had
been invented to render natural and familiar, and the&s;e &s;entiments
&s;till more endeared it. For, though it is the end of Philo&s;ophy, to
allay that wonder, which either the unu&s;ual or &s;eemingly disjointed
appearances of nature excite, yet &s;he never triumphs &s;o much, as
when, in order to connect together a few, in them&s;elves, perhaps,
incon&s;iderable objects, &s;he has, if I may &s;ay &s;o, created another con|&s;titution
of things, more natural indeed, and &s;uch as the imagination
can more ea&s;ily attend to, but more new, more contrary to common
<PB N="56" REF="149">
opinion and expectation, than any of tho&s;e appearances them&s;elves.
As, in the in&s;tance before us, in order to connect together &s;ome
&s;eeming irregularities in the motions of the Planets, the mo&s;t incon|&s;iderable
objects in the heavens, and of which the greater part of
mankind have no occa&s;ion to take any notice during the whole cour&s;e
of their lives, &s;he has, to talk in the hyperbolical language of Tycho-Brache,
moved the Earth from its foundations, &s;topt the revolution of
the Firmament, made the Sun &s;tand &s;till, and &s;ubverted the whole
order of the Univer&s;e.</P>
<P>Such were the advantages of this new hypothe&s;is, as they ap|peared
to its author, when he fir&s;t invented it. But, though that
love of paradox, &s;o natural to the learned, and that plea&s;ure, which
they are &s;o apt to take in exciting, by the novelty of their &s;uppo&s;ed
di&s;coveries, the amazement of mankind, may, notwith&s;tanding what
one of his di&s;ciples tells us to the contrary, have had its weight in
prompting Copernicus to adopt this &s;y&s;tem; yet, when he had com|pleted
his Treati&s;e of Revolutions, and began coolly to con&s;ider what
a &s;trange doctrine he was about to offer to the world, he &s;o much
dreaded the prejudice of mankind again&s;t it, that, by a &s;pecies of
continence, of all others the mo&s;t difficult to a philo&s;opher, he de|tained
it in his clo&s;et for thirty years together. At la&s;t, in the ex|tremity
of old age, he allowed it to be extorted from him, but died
as &s;oon as it was printed, and before it was publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>When it appeared in the world, it was almo&s;t univer&s;ally di&s;ap|proved
of, by the learned as well as by the ignorant. The natural
prejudices of &s;en&s;e, confirmed by education, prevailed too much with
both, to allow them to give it a fair examination. A few di&s;ciples
only, whom he him&s;elf had in&s;tructed in his doctrine, received it
with e&s;teem and admiration. One of them, Reinholdus, formed,
upon this hypothe&s;is, larger and more accurate a&s;tronomical tables,
<PB N="57" REF="150">
than what accompanied the Treati&s;e of Revolutions, in which Co|pernicus
had been guilty of &s;ome errors in calculation. It &s;oon ap|peared,
that the&s;e Prutenic Tables, as they were called, corre&s;ponded
more exactly with the heavens, than the Tables of Alphon&s;us. This
ought naturally to have formed a prejudice in favour of the diligence
and accuracy of Copernicus in ob&s;erving the heavens. But it ought
to have formed none in favour of his hypothe&s;is; &s;ince the &s;ame ob|&s;ervations,
and the re&s;ult of the &s;ame calculations, might have been
accommodated to the &s;y&s;tem of Ptolemy, without making any greater
alteration in that &s;y&s;tem than what Ptolemy had fore&s;een, and had
even foretold &s;hould be made. It formed, however, a prejudice in
favour of both, and the learned began to examine, with &s;ome atten|tion,
an hypothe&s;is which afforded the ea&s;ie&s;t methods of calcula|tion,
and upon which the mo&s;t exact predictions had been made.
The &s;uperior degree of coherence, which it be&s;towed upon the ce|le&s;tial
appearances, the &s;implicity and uniformity which it introduced
into the real directions and velocities of the Planets, &s;oon di&s;po&s;ed
many a&s;tronomers, fir&s;t to favour, and at la&s;t to embrace a &s;y&s;tem,
which thus connected together &s;o happily, the mo&s;t disjointed of
tho&s;e objects that chiefly occupied their thoughts. Nor can any
thing more evidently demon&s;trate, how ea&s;ily the learned give up
the evidence of their &s;en&s;es to pre&s;erve the coherence of the ideas of
their imagination, than the readine&s;s with which this, the mo&s;t vio|lent
paradox in all philo&s;ophy, was adopted by many ingenious a&s;tro|nomers,
notwith&s;tanding its incon&s;i&s;tency with every &s;i&s;tem of phy|&s;ics
then known in the world, and notwith&s;tanding the great number
of other more real objections, to which, as Copernicus left it, this
account of things was mo&s;t ju&s;tly expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>It was adopted, however, nor can this be wondered at, by a&s;tro|nomers
only. The learned in all other &s;ciences, continued to regard
it with the &s;ame contempt as the vulgar. Even a&s;tronomers were di|vided
<PB N="58" REF="151">
about its merit; and many of them rejected a doctrine, which
not only contradicted the e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;y&s;tem of Natural Philo&s;ophy,
but which, con&s;idered a&s;tronomically only, &s;eemed to labour under
&s;everal difficulties.</P>
<P>Some of the objections again&s;t the motion of the Earth, that were
drawn from the prejudices of &s;en&s;e, the patrons of this &s;y&s;tem, in|deed,
ea&s;ily enough, got over. They repre&s;ented, that the Earth
might really be in motion, though, to its inhabitants, it &s;eemed to be
at re&s;t; and that the Sun, and Fixed Stars, might really be at re&s;t,
though from the Earth they &s;eemed to be in motion; in the &s;ame
manner as a &s;hip, which &s;ails through a &s;mooth &s;ea, &s;eems to tho&s;e
who are in it, to be at re&s;t, though really in motion; while the ob|jects
which &s;he pa&s;&s;es along, &s;eem to be in motion, though really at
re&s;t.</P>
<P>But there were &s;ome other objections, which, though grounded
upon the &s;ame natural prejudices, they found it more difficult to get
over. The Earth had always pre&s;ented it&s;elf to the &s;en&s;es, not only
as at re&s;t, but as inert, ponderous, and even aver&s;e to motion. The
imagination had always been accu&s;tomed to conceive it as &s;uch, and
&s;uffered the greate&s;t violence, when obliged to pur&s;ue, and attend it,
in that rapid motion which the &s;y&s;tem of Copernicus be&s;towed upon
it. To enforce their objection, the adver&s;aries of this hypothe&s;is were
at pains to calculate the extreme rapidity of this motion. They re|pre&s;ented,
that the circumference of the Earth had been computed
to be above twenty-three thou&s;and miles: if the Earth, therefore, was
&s;uppo&s;ed to revolve every day round its axis, every point of it near
the equator would pa&s;s over above twenty-three thou&s;and miles in a
day; and con&s;equently, near a thou&s;and miles in an hour, and about
&s;ixteen miles in a minute; a motion more rapid than that of a can|non
ball, or even than the &s;wifter progre&s;s of &s;ound. The rapi|pidity
<PB N="59" REF="152">
of its periodical revolution was yet more violent than that of
its diurnal rotation. How, therefore, could the imagination ever
conceive &s;o ponderous a body to be naturally endowed with &s;o dread|ful
a movement? The Peripatetic Philo&s;ophy, the only philo&s;ophy
then known in the world, &s;till further confirmed this prejudice.
That philo&s;ophy, by a very natural, though, perhaps, groundle&s;s
di&s;tinction, divided all motion into Natural and Violent. Natural mo|tion
was that which flowed from an innate tendency in the body, as
when a &s;tone fell downwards: Violent motion, that which aro&s;e from
external force, and which was, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, contrary to the na|tural
tendency of the body, as when a &s;tone was thrown upwards,
or horizontally. No violent motion could be la&s;ting; for, being con|&s;tantly
weakened by the natural tendency of the body, it would &s;oon
be de&s;troyed. The natural motion of the Earth, as was evident in
all its parts, was downwards, in a &s;trait line to the center; as that of
fire and air was upwards, in a &s;trait line from the center. It was the
heavens only that revolved naturally in a circle. Neither, therefore,
the &s;uppo&s;ed revolution of the Earth round its own center, nor that
round the Sun, could be natural motions; they mu&s;t therefore be
violent, and con&s;equently could be of no long continuance. It was
in vain that Copernicus replied, that gravity was, probably, nothing
el&s;e be&s;ides a tendency in the different parts of the &s;ame Planet, to
unite them&s;elves to one another; that this tendency took place, pro|bably,
in the parts of the other Planets, as well as in tho&s;e of the
Earth; that it could very well be united with a circular motion; that
it might be equally natural to the whole body of the Planet, and to
every part of it; that his adver&s;aries them&s;elves allowed, that a cir|cular
motion was natural to the heavens, who&s;e diurnal revolution
was infinitely more rapid than even that motion which he had be|&s;towed
upon the Earth; that though a like motion was natural to the
Earth, it would &s;till appear to be at re&s;t to its inhabitants, and all the
parts of it to tend in a &s;trait line to the center, in the &s;ame manner
<PB N="60" REF="153">
as at pre&s;ent. But this an&s;wer, how &s;atisfactory &s;oever it may ap|pear
to be now, neither did nor could appear to be &s;atisfactory then.
By admitting the di&s;tinction betwixt natural and violent motions, it
was founded upon the &s;ame ignorance of mechanical principles with
the objection. The &s;y&s;tems of Ari&s;totle and Hipparchus &s;uppo&s;ed,
indeed, the diurnal motion of the heavenly bodies to be infinitely
more rapid than even that dreadful movement which Copernicus be|&s;towed
upon the Earth. But they &s;uppo&s;ed, at the &s;ame time, that tho&s;e
bodies were objects of a quite different &s;pecies, from any we are ac|quainted
with, near the &s;urface of the Earth, and to which, therefore,
it was le&s;s difficult to conceive that any &s;ort of motion might be na|tural.
Tho&s;e objects, be&s;ides, had never pre&s;ented them&s;elves to the
&s;en&s;es, as moving otherwi&s;e, or with le&s;s rapidity, than the&s;e &s;y&s;tems
repre&s;ented them. The imagination, therefore, could feel no diffi|culty
in following a repre&s;entation which the &s;en&s;es had rendered quite
familiar to it. But when the Planets came to be regarded as &s;o many
Earths, the ca&s;e was quite altered. The imagination had been ac|cu&s;tomed
to conceive &s;uch objects as tending rather to re&s;t than mo|tion;
and this idea of their natural inertne&s;s, encumbered, if one
may &s;ay &s;o, and clogged its flight, whenever it endeavoured to pur&s;ue
them in their periodical cour&s;es, and to conceive them as continually
ru&s;hing through the cele&s;tial &s;paces, with &s;uch violent and unremit|ting
rapidity.</P>
<P>Nor were the fir&s;t followers of Copernicus more fortunate in their
an&s;wers to &s;ome other objections, which were founded indeed in the
&s;ame ignorance of the laws of motion, but which, at the &s;ame time,
were nece&s;&s;arily connected with that way of conceiving things, which
then prevailed univer&s;ally in the learned world.</P>
<P>If the Earth, it was &s;aid, revolved &s;o rapidly from we&s;t to ea&s;t, a
perpetual wind would &s;et in from ea&s;t to we&s;t, more violent than what
<PB N="61" REF="154">
blows in the greate&s;t hurricanes; a &s;tone, thrown we&s;twards, would
fly to a much greater di&s;tance than one thrown with the &s;ame force
ea&s;twards; as what moved in a direction, contrary to the motion of
the Earth, would nece&s;&s;arily pa&s;s over a greater portion of its &s;ur|face,
than what, with the &s;ame velocity, moved along with it. A
ball, it was &s;aid, dropt from the ma&s;t of a &s;hip under &s;ail, does not
fall preci&s;ely at the foot of the ma&s;t, but behind it; and in the &s;ame
manner, a &s;tone dropt from a high tower would not, upon the &s;up|po&s;ition
of the Earth's motion, fall preci&s;ely at the bottom of the
tower, but we&s;t of it, the Earth being, in the mean time, carried
away ea&s;tward from below it. It is amu&s;ing to ob&s;erve, by what
&s;ubtile and metaphy&s;ical eva&s;ions the followers of Copernicus endea|voured
to elude this objection, which, before the doctrine of the
Compo&s;ition of Motion had been explained by Galileo, was altoge|ther
unan&s;werable. They allowed, that a ball dropt from the ma&s;t
of a &s;hip under &s;ail would not fall at the foot of the ma&s;t, but behind
it; becau&s;e the ball, they &s;aid, was no part of the &s;hip, and becau&s;e
the motion of the &s;hip was natural neither to it&s;elf nor to the ball.
But the &s;tone was a part of the earth, and the diurnal and annual
revolutions of the Earth were natural to the whole, and to every
part of it, and therefore to the &s;tone. The &s;tone, therefore, having
naturally the &s;ame motion with the Earth, fell preci&s;ely at the bottom
of the tower. But this an&s;wer could not &s;atisfy the imagination,
which &s;till found it difficult to conceive how the&s;e motions could be
natural to the Earth; or how a body, which had always pre&s;ented
it&s;elf to the &s;en&s;es as inert, ponderous, and aver&s;e to motion, &s;hould
naturally be continually wheeling about both its own axis and the
Sun, with &s;uch violent rapidity. It was, be&s;ides, argued by Tycho
Brache, upon the principles of the &s;ame philo&s;ophy, which had
afforded both the objection and the an&s;wer, that even upon the &s;up|po&s;ition,
that any &s;uch motion was natural to the whole body of the
Earth, yet the &s;tone, which was &s;eparated from it, could no longer
<PB N="62" REF="155">
be actuated by that motion. The limb, which is cut off from an
animal, lo&s;es tho&s;e animal motions which were natural to the whole.
The branch, which is cut off from the trunk, lo&s;es that vegetative mo|tion
which is natural to the whole tree. Even the metals, minerals,
and &s;tones, which are dug out from the bo&s;om of the Earth, lo&s;e
tho&s;e motions which occa&s;ioned their production and encrea&s;e, and
which were natural to them in their original &s;tate. Though the diurnal
and annual motion of the Earth, therefore, had been natural to them
while they were contained in its bo&s;om; it could no longer be &s;o
when they were &s;eparated from it.</P>
<P>Tycho Brache, the great re&s;torer of the &s;cience of the heavens,
who had &s;pent his life, and wa&s;ted his fortune upon the advancement
of A&s;tronomy, who&s;e ob&s;ervations were both more numerous and
more accurate than tho&s;e of all the atronomers who had gone before
him, was him&s;elf &s;o much affected by the force of this objection,
that, though he never mentioned the &s;y&s;tem of Copernicus without
&s;ome note of the high admiration he had conceived for its author,
he could never him&s;elf be induced to embrace it: yet all his a&s;trono|mical
ob&s;ervations tended to confirm it. They demon&s;trated, that
Venus and Mercury were &s;ometimes above, and &s;ometimes below the
Sun; and that, con&s;equently, the Sun, and not the Earth, was the
center of their periodical revolutions. They &s;howed, that Mars,
when in his meridian at midnight, was nearer to the Earth than the
Earth is to the Sun; though, when in conjunction with the Sun, he
was much more remote from the Earth than that luminary; a di&s;co|very
which was ab&s;olutely incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;y&s;tem of Ptolemy,
which proved, that the Sun, and not the Earth, was the center of the
periodical revolutions of Mars, as well as of Venus and Mercury;
and which demon&s;trated, that the Earth was placed betwixt the orbits
of Mars and Venus. They made the &s;ame thing probable with re|gard
to Jupiter and Saturn; that they, too, revolved round the Sun;
<PB N="63" REF="156">
and that, therefore, the Sun, if not the center of the univer&s;e, was at
lea&s;t, that of the planetary &s;y&s;tem. They proved, that Comets were
&s;uperior to the Moon, and moved through the heavens in all po&s;&s;ible
directions; an ob&s;ervation incompatible with the Solid Spheres of
Ari&s;totle and Purbach, and which, therefore, overturned the phy&s;ical
part, at lea&s;t, of the e&s;tabli&s;hed A&s;tronomy.</P>
<P>All the&s;e ob&s;ervations, joined to his aver&s;ion to the &s;y&s;tem, and
perhaps, notwith&s;tanding the genero&s;ity of his character, &s;ome little
jealou&s;y of the fame of Copernicus, &s;ugge&s;ted to Tycho the idea of
a new hypothe&s;is, in which the Earth continued to be, as in the old
account, the immoveable center of the univer&s;e, round which the
firmament revolved every day from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and, by &s;ome &s;ecret
virtue, carried the Sun, the Moon, and the Five Planets along with
it, notwith&s;tanding their immen&s;e di&s;tance, and notwith&s;tanding that
there was nothing betwixt it and them but the mo&s;t fluid ether.
But, although all the&s;e &s;even bodies thus obeyed the diurnal revolu|tion
of the Firmament, they had each of them, as in the old &s;y&s;tem,
too, a contrary periodical ea&s;tward revolution of their own, which
made them appear to be every day, more or le&s;s, left behind by the
Firmament. The Sun was the center of the periodical revolutions of
the Five Planets; the Earth, that of the Sun and Moon. The Five
Planets followed the Sun in his periodical revolution round the Earth,
as they did the Firmament in its diurnal rotation. The three &s;upe|rior
Planets comprehended the Earth within the orbit in which they
revolved round the Sun, and had each of them an Epicycle to con|nect
together, in the &s;ame manner as in the &s;y&s;tem of Ptolemy, their
direct, retrograde, and &s;tationary appearances. As, notwith&s;tanding
their immen&s;e di&s;tance, they followed the Sun in his periodical re|volution
round the Earth, keeping always at an equal di&s;tance from
him, they were nece&s;&s;arily brought much nearer to the Earth when
in oppo&s;ition to the Sun, than when in conjunction with him. Mars,
<PB N="64" REF="157">
the neare&s;t of them, when in his meridian at midnight, came within
the orbit which the Sun de&s;cribed round the Earth, and con&s;equently
was then nearer to the Earth than the Earth was to the Sun. The
appearances of the two inferior Planets were explained, in the &s;ame
manner, as in the &s;y&s;tem of Copernicus, and con&s;equently required
no Epicycle to connect them. The circles in which the Five Planets
performed their periodical revolutions round the Sun, as well as tho&s;e
in which the Sun and Moon performed theirs round the Earth, were,
as both in the old and new hypothe&s;is, Eccentric Circles, to connect
together their differently accelerated and retarded motions.</P>
<P>Such was the &s;y&s;tem of Tycho Brache, compounded, as is evi|dent,
out of the&s;e of Ptolemy and Copernicus; happier than that of
Ptolemy, in the account which it gives of the motions of the two
inferior Planets; more complex, by &s;uppo&s;ing the different revolu|tions
of all the Five to be performed round two different centers; the
diurnal round the Earth, the periodical round the Sun; but, in every
re&s;pect, more complex and more incoherent than that of Copernicus.
Such, however, was the difficulty that mankind felt in conceiving
the motion of the Earth, that it long balanced the reputation of that
otherwi&s;e more beautiful &s;y&s;tem. It may be &s;aid, that tho&s;e who
con&s;idered the heavens only, favoured the &s;y&s;tem of Copernicus,
which connected &s;o happily all the appearances which pre&s;ented
them&s;elves there. But that tho&s;e who looked upon the Earth,
adopted the account of Tycho Brache, which, leaving it at re&s;t in
the center of the univer&s;e, did le&s;s violence to the u&s;ual habits of the
imagination. The learned were, indeed, &s;en&s;ible of the intricacy,
and of the many incoherences of that &s;y&s;tem; that it gave no ac|count
why the Sun, Moon, and Five Planets, &s;hould follow the re|volution
of the Firmament; or why the Five Planets, notwith&s;tand|ing
the immen&s;e di&s;tance of the three &s;uperior ones, &s;hould obey the
periodical motion of the Sun; or why the Earth, though placed be|tween
<PB N="65" REF="158">
the orbits of Mars and Venus, &s;hould remain immoveable in
the center of the Firmament, and con&s;tantly re&s;i&s;t the influence of
whatever it was, which carried bodies that were &s;o much larger than
it&s;elf, and that were placed on all &s;ides of it, periodically round the
Sun. Tycho Brahe died before he had fully explained his &s;y&s;tem.
His great and merited renown di&s;po&s;ed many of the learned to be|lieve,
that, had his life been longer, he would have connected toge|ther
many of the&s;e incoherences, and knew methods of adapting his
&s;y&s;tem to &s;ome other appearances, with which none of his followers
could connect it.</P>
<P>The objection to the &s;y&s;tem of Copernicus, which was drawn
from the nature of motion, and that was mo&s;t in&s;i&s;ted on by Tycho
Brahe, was at la&s;t fully an&s;wered by Galileo; not, however, till
about thirty years after the death of Tycho, and about a hundred
after that of Copernicus. It was then that Galileo, by explaining
the nature of the compo&s;ition of motion, by &s;howing, both from
rea&s;on and experience, that a ball dropt from the ma&s;t of a &s;hip
under &s;ail would fall preci&s;ely at the foot of the ma&s;t, and by ren|dering
this doctrine, from a great number of other in&s;tances, quite
familiar to the imagination, took off, perhaps, the principal objection
which had been made to this hypothe&s;is.</P>
<P>Several other a&s;tronomical difficulties, which encumbered this ac|count
of things, were removed by the &s;ame philo&s;opher. Coperni|cus,
after altering the center of the world, and making the Earth,
and all the Planets revolve round the Sun, was obliged to leave the
Moon to revolve round the Earth as before. But no example of any
&s;uch &s;econdary Planet having then been di&s;covered in the heavens,
there &s;eemed &s;till to be this irregularity remaining in the &s;y&s;tem.
Galileo, who fir&s;t applied tele&s;copes to A&s;tronomy, di&s;covered, by
their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the Satellites of Jupiter, which, revolving round
<PB N="66" REF="159">
that Planet, at the &s;ame time that they were carried along with it in
its revolution, round either the Earth, or the Sun, made it &s;eem le&s;s
contrary to the analogy of nature, that the Moon &s;hould both re|volve
round the Earth, and accompany her in her revolution round
the Sun.</P>
<P>It had been objected to Copernicus, that, if Venus and Mercury
revolved round the Sun, in an orbit comprehended within the orbit
of the Earth, they would &s;how all the &s;ame pha&s;es with the Moon,
pre&s;ent, &s;ometimes their darkened, and &s;ometimes their enlightened
&s;ides to the Earth, and &s;ometimes part of the one, and part of the
other. He an&s;wered, that they undoubtedly did all this; but that
their &s;mallne&s;s and di&s;tance hindered us from perceiving it. This
very bold a&s;&s;ertion of Copernicus was confirmed by Galileo. His
tele&s;copes rendered the pha&s;es of Venus quite &s;en&s;ible, and thus de|mon&s;trated,
more evidently than had been done, even by the ob&s;er|vations
of Tycho Brahe, the revolutions of the&s;e two Planets round
the Sun, as well as &s;o far de&s;troyed the &s;y&s;tem of Ptolemy.</P>
<P>The mountains and seas, which, by the help of the &s;ame in&s;tru|ment,
he di&s;covered, or imagined he had di&s;covered in the Moon,
rendering that Planet, in every re&s;pect, &s;imilar to the Earth, made it
&s;eem le&s;s contrary to the analogy of nature, that, as the Moon
revolved round the Earth, the Earth &s;hould revolve round the
Sun.</P>
<P>The &s;pots which, in the &s;ame manner, he di&s;covered in the Sun,
demon&s;trating, by their motion, the revolution of the Sun round his
axis, made it &s;eem le&s;s improbable that the Earth, a body &s;o much
&s;maller than the Sun, &s;hould revolve round her axis in the &s;ame
manner.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="160">
Succeeding tele&s;copical ob&s;ervations, di&s;covered, in each of the
Five Planets, &s;pots not unlike tho&s;e which Galileo had ob&s;erved in
the Moon, and thereby &s;eemed to demon&s;trate what Copernicus had
only conjectured, that the Planets were naturally opaque, enlightened
only by the rays of the Sun, habitable, diver&s;ified by &s;eas and moun|tains,
and, in every re&s;pect, bodies of the &s;ame kind with the Earth;
and thus added one other probability to this &s;y&s;tem. By di&s;covering,
too, that each of the Planets revolved round its own axis, at the
&s;ame time that it was carried round either the Earth or the Sun, they
made it &s;eem quite agreeable to the analogy of nature, that the Earth,
which, in every other re&s;pect, re&s;embled the Planets, &s;hould, like
them too, revolve round its own axis, and at the &s;ame time perform
its periodical motion round the Sun.</P>
<P>While, in Italy, the unfortunate Galileo was adding &s;o many pro|babilities
to the &s;y&s;tem of Copernicus, there was another philo&s;opher
employing him&s;elf in Germany, to a&s;certain, correct, and improve it:
Kepler, with great genius, but without the ta&s;te, or the order and me|thod
of Galileo, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, like all his other countrymen, the mo&s;t labo|rious
indu&s;try, joined to that pa&s;&s;ion for di&s;covering proportions and re|&s;emblances
betwixt the different parts of nature, which, though com|mon
to all philo&s;ophers, &s;eems, in him, to have been exce&s;&s;ive. He
had been in&s;tructed, by Mae&s;tlinus, in the &s;y&s;tem of Copernicus;
and his fir&s;t curio&s;ity was, as he tells us, to find out, why the Pla|nets,
the Earth being counted for one, were Six in number; why
they were placed at &s;uch irregular di&s;tances from the Sun; and whe|ther
there was any uniform proportion betwixt their &s;everal di&s;tances,
and the times employed in their periodical revolutions. Till &s;ome
rea&s;on, or proportion of this kind, could be di&s;covered, the &s;y&s;tem did
not appear to him to be completely coherent. He endeavoured, fir&s;t,
to find it in the proportions of numbers, and plain figures; after|wards,
in tho&s;e of the regular &s;olids; and, la&s;t of all, in tho&s;e of the
<PB N="68" REF="161">
mu&s;ical divi&s;ions of the Octave. Whatever was the &s;cience which
Kepler was &s;tudying, he &s;eems con&s;tantly to have plea&s;ed him&s;elf
with finding &s;ome analogy betwixt it and the &s;y&s;tem of the univer&s;e;
and thus, arithmetic and mu&s;ic, plain and &s;olid geometry, came all
of them by turns to illu&s;trate the doctrine of the Sphere, in the ex|plaining
of which he was, by his profe&s;&s;ion, principally employed.
Tycho Brahe, to whom he had pre&s;ented one of his books, though
he could not but di&s;approve of his &s;y&s;tem, was plea&s;ed, however,
with his genius, and with his indefatigable diligence in making the
mo&s;t laborious calculations. That generous and magnificent Dane
invited the ob&s;cure and indigent Kepler to come and live with him,
and communicated to him, as &s;oon as he arrived, his ob&s;ervations
upon Mars, in the arranging and methodizing of which his di&s;|ciples
were at that time employed. Kepler, upon comparing them
with one another, found, that the orbit of Mars was not a perfect
circle; that one of its diameters was &s;omewhat longer than the
other; and that it approached to an oval, or an ellip&s;e, which had
the Sun placed in one of its foci. He found, too, that the motion
of the Planet was not equable; that it was &s;wifte&s;t when neare&s;t the
Sun, and &s;lowe&s;t when furthe&s;t from him; and that its velocity gra|dually
encrea&s;ed, or dimini&s;hed, according as it approached or re|ceded
from him. The ob&s;ervations of the &s;ame a&s;tronomer di&s;co|vered
to him, though not &s;o evidently, that the &s;ame things were
true of all the other Planets; that their orbits were elliptical, and that
their motions were &s;wifte&s;t when neare&s;t the Sun, and &s;lowe&s;t when
furthe&s;t from him. They &s;howed the &s;ame things, too, of the Sun,
if &s;uppo&s;ed to revolve round the Earth; and con&s;equently of the
Earth, if &s;uppo&s;ed to revolve round the Sun.</P>
<P>That the motions of all the heavenly bodies were perfectly circu|lar,
had been the fundamental idea, upon which every a&s;tronomical
hypothe&s;is, except the irregular one of the Stoics, had been built.
<PB N="69" REF="162">
A circle, as the degree of its curvature is every where the &s;ame, is
of all curve lines the &s;imple&s;t and the mo&s;t ea&s;ily conceived. Since
it was evident, therefore, that the heavenly bodies did not move in
&s;trait lines, the indolent imagination found, that it could mo&s;t ea|&s;ily
attend to their motions if they were &s;uppo&s;ed to revolve in per|fect
circles. It had, upon this account, determined that a circular
motion was the mo&s;t perfect of all motions, and that none but the
mo&s;t perfect motion could be worthy of &s;uch beautiful and divine
objects; and it had upon this account, &s;o often, in vain, endeavoured
to adju&s;t to the appearances, &s;o many different &s;y&s;tems, which all
&s;uppo&s;ed them to revolve in this manner.</P>
<P>The equality of their motions was another fundamental idea,
which, in the &s;ame manner, and for the &s;ame rea&s;on, was &s;uppo&s;ed
by all the founders of a&s;tronomical &s;y&s;tems. For an equal motion
can be more ea&s;ily attended to, than one that is continually either ac|celerated
or retarded. All incon&s;tancy, therefore, was declared to
be unworthy tho&s;e bodies which revolved in the cele&s;tial regions,
and to be fit only for inferior and &s;ublunary things. The calcula|tions
of Kepler overturned, with regard to the Planets, both the&s;e na|tural
prejudices of the imagination; de&s;troyed their circular orbits;
and introduced into their real motions, &s;uch an inequality as no equali|zing
circle would remedy. It was, however, to render their mo|tions
perfectly equable, without even the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of an equalizing
circle, that Copernicus, as he him&s;elf a&s;&s;ures us, had originally in|vented
his &s;y&s;tem. Since the calculations of Kepler, therefore, over|turned
what Copernicus had principally in view in e&s;tabli&s;hing his
&s;y&s;tem, we cannot wonder that they &s;hould at fir&s;t &s;eem rather to em|barra&s;s
than improve it.</P>
<P>It is true, by the&s;e elliptical orbits and unequal motions, Kepler
di&s;engaged the &s;y&s;tem from the embarra&s;&s;ment of tho&s;e &s;mall Epi|cycles,
<PB N="70" REF="163">
which Copernicus, in order to connect the &s;eemingly accele|rated
and retarded movements of the Planets with their &s;uppo&s;ed real
equality, had been obliged to leave in it. For it is remarkable, that
though Copernicus had delivered the orbits of the Planets from the
enormous Epicycles of Hipparchus, that though in this con&s;i&s;ted the
great &s;uperiority of his &s;y&s;tem above that of the ancient a&s;tronomers,
he was yet obliged, him&s;elf, to abandon, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, this ad|vantage,
and to make u&s;e of &s;ome &s;mall Epicycles, to join together
tho&s;e &s;eeming irregularities. His Epicycles indeed, like the irregu|larities
for who&s;e &s;ake they were introduced, were but &s;mall ones,
and the imaginations of his fir&s;t followers &s;eem, accordingly, either to
have &s;lurred them over altogether, or &s;carcely to have ob&s;erved them.
Neither Galileo, nor Ga&s;&s;endi, the two mo&s;t eloquent of his defend|ers,
take any notice of them. Nor does it &s;eem to have been ge|nerally
attended to, that there was any &s;uch thing as Epicycles in the
&s;y&s;tem of Copernicus, till Kepler, in order to vindicate his own el|liptical
orbits, in&s;i&s;ted, that even, according to Copernicus, the body
of the Planet was to be found but at two different places in the cir|cumference
of that circle which the center of its Epicycle de|&s;cribed.</P>
<P>It
is true, too, that an ellip&s;e is, of all curve lines after a circle,
the &s;imple&s;t and mo&s;t ea&s;ily conceived; and it is true, be&s;ides all this,
that, while Kepler took from the motion of the Planets the ea&s;ie&s;t of all
proportions, that of equality, he did not leave them ab&s;olutely with|out
one, but a&s;certained the rule by which their velocities continually
varied; for a genius &s;o fond of analogies, when he had taken away
one, would be &s;ure to &s;ub&s;titute another in its room. Notwith|&s;tanding
all this, notwith&s;tanding that his &s;y&s;tem was better &s;up|ported
by ob&s;ervations than any &s;y&s;tem had ever been before, yet,
&s;uch was the attachment to the equal motions and circular orbits of
the Planets, that it &s;eems, for &s;ome time, to have been in general but
<PB N="71" REF="164">
little attended to by the learned, to have been altogether neglected
by philo&s;ophers, and not much regarded even by a&s;tronomers.</P>
<P>Ga&s;&s;endi, who began to &s;igure in the world about the latter days of
Kepler, and who was him&s;elf no mean a&s;tronomer, &s;eems indeed to
have conceived a good deal of e&s;teem for his diligence and accuracy
in accommodating the ob&s;ervations of Tycho Brahe to the &s;y&s;tem of
Copernicus. But Ga&s;&s;endi appears to have had no comprehen&s;ion of
the importance of tho&s;e alterations which Kepler had made in that
&s;y&s;tem, as is evident from his &s;carcely ever mentioning them in the
whole cour&s;e of his voluminous writings upon A&s;tronomy. Des
Cartes, the cotemporary and rival of Ga&s;&s;endi, &s;eems to have paid
no attention to them at all, but to have built his Theory of the
Heavens, without any regard to them. Even tho&s;e a&s;tronomers,
whom a &s;erious attention had convinced of the ju&s;tne&s;s of his cor|rections,
were &s;till &s;o enamoured with the circular orbits and equal
motions, that they endeavoured to compound his &s;y&s;tem with tho&s;e
ancient, but natural prejudices. Thus, Ward endeavoured to &s;how
that, though the Planets moved in elliptical orbits, which had the
Sun in one of their foci, and though their velocities in the elliptical
line were continually varying, yet, if a ray was &s;uppo&s;ed to be ex|tended
from the center of any one of them to the other focus, and to be
carried along by the periodical motion of the Planet, it would make
equal angles in equal times, and con&s;equently cut off equal portions
of the circle of which that other focus was the center. To one,
therefore, placed in that focus, the motion of the Planet would ap|pear
to be perfectly circular and perfectly equable, in the &s;ame man|ner
as in the Equalizing Circles of Ptolemy and Hipparchus. Thus
Bouillaud, who cen&s;ured this hypothe&s;is of Ward, invented another
of the &s;ame kind, infinitely more whim&s;ical and capricious. The
Planets, according to that a&s;tronomer, always revolve in circles; for
that being the mo&s;t perfect figure, it is impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould revolve
<PB N="72" REF="165">
in any other. No one of them, however, continues to move in any
one circle, but is perpetually pa&s;&s;ing from, one to another, through an
infinite number of circles, in the cour&s;e of each revolution; for an
ellip&s;e, &s;aid he, is an oblique &s;ection of a cone, and in a cone, be|twixt
the two vortices of the ellip&s;e there is an infinite number of
circles, out of the infinitely &s;mall portions of which the elliptical line
is compounded. The Planer, therefore, which moves in this line, is,
in every point of it, moving in an infinitely &s;mall portion of a cer|tain
circle. The motion of each Planet, too, according to him,
was nece&s;&s;arily, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, perfectly equable. An equable
motion being the mo&s;t perfect of all motions. It was not, however,
in the elliptical line, that it was equable, but in any one of the cir|cles
that were parallel to the ba&s;e of that cone, by who&s;e &s;ection this
elliptical line had been formed: for, if a ray was extended from the
Planet to any one of tho&s;e circles, and carried along by its periodical
motion, it would cut off equal portions of that circle in equal times;
another mo&s;t fanta&s;tical equalizing circle, &s;upported by no other
foundation be&s;ides the frivolous connection betwixt a cone and an
ellip&s;e, and recommended by nothing but the natural pa&s;&s;ion for cir|cular
orbits and equable motions. It may be regarded as the la&s;t ef|fort
of this pa&s;&s;ion, and many &s;erve to &s;how the force of that prin|ciple
which could thus oblige this accurate ob&s;erver, and great im|prover
of the Theory of the Heavens, to adopt &s;o &s;trange an hypo|the&s;is.
Such was the difficulty and he&s;itation with which the fol|lowers
of Copernicus adopted the corrections of Kepler.</P>
<P>The rule, indeed, which Kepler a&s;certained for determining the
gradual acceleration or retardation in the movement of the Planets,
was intricate, and difficult to be comprehended; it could therefore
but little facilitate the progre&s;s of the imagination in tracing tho&s;e
revolutions which were &s;uppo&s;ed to be conducted by it. According
to that a&s;tronomer, if a &s;trait line was drawn from the center of
<PB N="73" REF="166">
each Planet to the Sun, and carried along by the periodical motion
of the Planet, it would de&s;cribe equal areas in equal times, though
the Planet did not pa&s;s over equal &s;paces; and the &s;ame rule, he
found, took place nearly with regard to the Moon. The imagina|tion,
when acquainted with the law by which any motion is accele|rated
or retarded, can follow and attend to it more ea&s;ily, than when
at a lo&s;s, and, as it were, wandering in uncertainty with regard to
the proportion which regulates its varieties; the di&s;covery of this
analogy therefore, no doubt, rendered the &s;y&s;tem of Kepler more
agreeable to the natural ta&s;te of mankind: it was, however, an ana|logy
too difficult to be followed, or comprehended, to render it com|pletely
&s;o.</P>
<P>Kepler, be&s;ides this, introduced another new analogy into the &s;y&s;|tem,
and fir&s;t di&s;covered, that there was one uniform relation ob|&s;erved
betwixt the di&s;tances of the Planets from the Sun, and the
times employed in their periodical motions. He found, that their
periodical times were greater than in proportion to their di&s;tances,
and le&s;s than in proportion to the &s;quares of tho&s;e di&s;tances; but,
that they were nearly as the mean proportionals betwixt their di&s;|tances
and the &s;quares of their di&s;tances; or, in other words, that
the &s;quares of their periodical times were nearly as the cubes of
their di&s;tances; an analogy, which, though, like all others, it no
doubt rendered the &s;y&s;tem &s;omewhat more di&s;tinct and comprehen|&s;ible,
was, however, as well as the former, of too intricate a nature
to facilitate very much the effort of the imagination in conceiv|ing
it.</P>
<P>The truth of both the&s;e analogies, intricate as they were, was at
la&s;t fully e&s;tabli&s;hed by the ob&s;ervations of Ca&s;&s;ini. That a&s;tronomer
fir&s;t di&s;covered, that the &s;econdary Planets of Jupiter and Saturn re|volved
round their primary ones, according to the &s;ame laws which
<PB N="74" REF="167">
Kepler had ob&s;erved in the revolutions of the primary ones round
the Sun, and that of the Moon round the earth; that each of them
de&s;cribed equal areas in equal times, and that the &s;quares of their
periodic times were as the cubes of their di&s;tances. When the&s;e
two la&s;t ab&s;tru&s;e analogies, which, when Kepler at fir&s;t ob&s;erved
them, were but little regarded, had been thus found to take place in
the revolutions of the Four Satellites of Jupiter, and in tho&s;e of the
Five of Saturn, they were now thought not only to confirm the
doctrine of Kepler, but to add a new probability to the Copernican
hypothe&s;is. The ob&s;ervations of Ca&s;&s;ini &s;eem to e&s;tabli&s;h it as a law
of the &s;y&s;tem, that, when one body revolved round another, it de|&s;cribed
equal areas in equal times; and that, when &s;everal revolved
round the &s;ame body, the &s;quares of their periodic times were as
the cubes of their di&s;tances. If the Earth and the Five Planets were
&s;uppo&s;ed to revolve round the Sun, the&s;e laws, it was &s;aid, would
take place univer&s;ally. But if, according to the &s;y&s;tem of Ptolemy,
the Sun, Moon, and Five Planets were &s;uppo&s;ed to revolve round
the Earth, the periodical motions of the Sun and Moon would, in|deed,
ob&s;erve the fir&s;t of the&s;e laws, would each of them de&s;cribe
equal areas in equal times; but they would not ob&s;erve the &s;econd,
the &s;quares of their periodic times would not be as the cubes of their
di&s;tances: and the revolutions of the Five Planets would ob&s;erve
neither the one law nor the other. Or if, according to the &s;y&s;tem
of Tycho Brahe, the Five Planets were &s;uppo&s;ed to revolve round
the Sun, while the Sun and Moon revolved round the Earth, the re|volutions
of the Five Planets round the Sun, would, indeed, ob&s;erve
both the&s;e laws; but tho&s;e of the Sun and Moon round the Earth
would ob&s;erve only the fir&s;t of them. The analogy of nature,
therefore, could be pre&s;erved completely, according to no other &s;y&s;|tem
but that of Copernicus, which, upon that account, mu&s;t be the
true one. This argument is regarded by Voltaire, and the Cardinal
of Polignac, as an irrefragable demon&s;tration; even M' Laurin, who
<PB N="75" REF="168">
was more capable of judging; nay, Newton him&s;elf, &s;eems to men|tion
it as one of the principal evidences for the truth of that hypo|the&s;is.
Yet, an analogy of this kind, it would &s;eem, far from a
demon&s;tration, could afford, at mo&s;t, but the &s;hadow of a proba|bility.</P>
<P>It
is true, that though Ca&s;&s;ini &s;uppo&s;ed the Planets to revolve in
an oblong curve, it was in a curve &s;omewhat different from that of
Kepler. In the ellip&s;e the &s;um of the two lines, which are drawn
from any one point in the circumference to the two foci, is always
equal to that of tho&s;e which are drawn from any other point in the
circumference to the &s;ame foci. In the curve of Ca&s;&s;ini, it is not
the &s;um of the lines, but the rectangles which are contained under
the lines, that are always equal. As this, however, was a proportion
more difficult to be comprehended than the other, the curve of
Ca&s;&s;ini has never had the vogue.</P>
<P>Nothing now embarra&s;&s;ed the &s;y&s;tem of Corpernicus, but the dif|ficulty
which the imagination felt in conceiving bodies &s;o immen&s;ely
ponderous as the Earth, and the other Planets, revolving round the
Sun with &s;uch incredible rapidity. It was in vain that Copernicus
pretended, that, notwith&s;tanding the prejudices of &s;en&s;e, this circu|lar
motion might be as natural to the Planets, as it is to a &s;tone to fall
to the ground. The imagination had been accu&s;tomed to conceive
&s;uch objects as tending rather to re&s;t than motion. This habitual
idea of their natural inertne&s;s was incompatible with that of their
natural motion. It was in vain that Kepler, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t the
fancy in connecting together this natural inertne&s;s with their a&s;to|ni&s;hing
velocities, talked of &s;ome vital and immaterial virtue, which
was &s;hed by the Sun into the &s;urrounding &s;paces, which was
whirled about with his revolution round his own axis, and which,
taking hold of the Planets, forced them, in &s;pite of their ponde|rou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="76" REF="169">
and &s;trong propen&s;ity to re&s;t, thus to whirl about the center
of the &s;y&s;tem. The imagination had no hold of this immaterial vir|tue,
and could form no determinate idea of what it con&s;i&s;ted in.
The imagination, indeed, felt a gap, or interval, betwixt the con&s;tant
motion and the &s;uppo&s;ed inertne&s;s of the Planets, and had in this,
as in all other ca&s;es, &s;ome general idea or apprehen&s;ion that there mu&s;t
be a connecting chain of intermediate objects to link together the&s;e
di&s;cordant qualities. Wherein this connecting chain con&s;i&s;ted, it was,
indeed, at a lo&s;s to conceive; nor did the doctrine of Kepler lend it
any a&s;&s;i&s;tance in this re&s;pect. That doctrine, like almo&s;t all tho&s;e of
the philo&s;ophy in fa&s;hion during his time, be&s;towed a name upon
this invi&s;ible chain, called it an immaterial virtue, but afforded no
determinate idea of what was its nature.</P>
<P>Des Cartes was the fir&s;t who attempted to a&s;certain, preci&s;ely,
wherein this invi&s;ible chain con&s;i&s;ted, and to afford the imagination
a train of intermediate events, which, &s;ucceeding each other in an
order that was of all others the mo&s;t familiar to it, &s;hould unite tho&s;e
incoherent qualities, the rapid motion, and the natural inertne&s;s of
the Planets. Des Cartes was the fir&s;t who explained wherein con|&s;i&s;ted
the real inertne&s;s of matter; that it was not in an aver&s;ion to
motion, or in a propen&s;ity to re&s;t, but in a power of continuing in|differently
either at re&s;t or in motion, and of re&s;i&s;ting, with a cer|tain
force, whatever endeavoured to change its &s;tate from the one to
the other. According to that ingenious and fanciful philo&s;opher,
the whole of infinite &s;pace was full of matter, for with him matter
and exten&s;ion were the &s;ame, and con&s;equently there could be no
void. This immen&s;ity of matter, he &s;uppo&s;ed, to be divided into
an infinite number of very &s;mall cubes; all of which, being whirled
about upon their own centers, nece&s;&s;arily gave occa&s;ion to the pro|duction
of two different elements. The fir&s;t con&s;i&s;ted of tho&s;e an|gular
parts, which, having been nece&s;&s;arily rubbed off, and grinded
<PB N="77" REF="170">
yet &s;maller by their mutual friction, con&s;tituted the mo&s;t &s;ubtile and
moveable part of matter. The &s;econd con&s;i&s;ted of tho&s;e little glo|bules
that were formed by the rubbing off of the fir&s;t. The inter|&s;tices
betwixt the&s;e globules of the &s;econd element was filled up by
the particles of the fir&s;t. But in the infinite colli&s;ions, which mu&s;t
occur in an infinite &s;pace filled with matter, and all in motion, it
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily happen, that many of the globules of the &s;econd ele|ment
&s;hould be broken and grinded down into the fir&s;t. The quan|tity
of the fir&s;t element having thus been encrea&s;ed beyond what was
&s;ufficient to sill up the inter&s;tices of the &s;econd, it mu&s;t, in many
places, have been heaped up together, without any mixture of the &s;e|cond
along with it. Such, according to Des Cartes, was the origi|nal
divi&s;ion of matter. Upon this infinitude of matter thus divided,
a certain quantity of motion was originally impre&s;&s;ed by the Creator
of all things, and the laws of motion were &s;o adju&s;ted as always to
pre&s;erve the &s;ame quantity in it, without increa&s;e, and without di|minution.
Whatever motion was lo&s;t by one part of matter, was
communicated to &s;ome other; and whatever was acquired by one
part of matter, was derived from &s;ome other: and thus, through an
eternal revolution, from re&s;t to motion, and from motion to re&s;t,
in every part of the univer&s;e, the quantity of motion in the whole
was always the &s;ame.</P>
<P>But, as there was no void, no one part of matter could be
moved without thru&s;ting &s;ome other out of its place, nor that with|out
thru&s;ting &s;ome other, and &s;o on. To avoid, therefore, an in|finite
progre&s;s, he &s;uppo&s;ed, that the matter which any body pu&s;hed
before it, rolled immediately backwards, to &s;upply the place of that
matter which flowed in behind it; as we may ob&s;erve in the &s;wim|ming
of a fi&s;h, that the water, which it pu&s;hes before it, immediately
rolls backwards, to &s;upply the place of what flows in behind it, and
thus forms a &s;mall circle or vortex round the body of the fi&s;h. It
<PB N="78" REF="171">
was, in the &s;ame manner, that the motion originally impre&s;&s;ed by
the Creator upon the infinitude of matter, nece&s;&s;arily produced in it
an infinity of greater and &s;maller vortices, or circular &s;treams: and
the law of motion being &s;o adju&s;ted as always to pre&s;erve the &s;ame
quantity of motion in the univer&s;e, tho&s;e vortices either continued
for ever, or by their di&s;&s;olution give birth to others of the &s;ame kind.
There was, thus, at all times, an infinite number of greater and
&s;maller vortices, or circular &s;treams, revolving in the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>But, whatever moves in a circle, is con&s;tantly endeavouring to fly
off from the center of its revolution. For the natural motion of
all bodies is in a &s;traight line. All the particles of matter, therefore,
in each of tho&s;e greater vortices, were continually pre&s;&s;ing from the
center to the circumference, with more or le&s;s force, according to the
different degrees of their bulk and &s;olidity. The larger and more &s;olid
globules of the &s;econd element forced them&s;elves upwards to the cir|cumference,
while the &s;maller, more yielding, and more active par|ticles
of the fir&s;t, which could flow, even through the inter&s;tices of
the &s;econd, were forced downwards to the center. They were forced
downwards to the center, notwith&s;tanding their natural tendency was
upwards to the circumference; for the &s;ame rea&s;on that a piece of
wood, when plunged in water, is forced upwards to the furface,
notwith&s;tanding its natural tendency is downwards to the bottom;
becau&s;e its tendency downwards is le&s;s &s;trong than that of the parti|cles
of water, which, therefore, if one may &s;ay &s;o, pre&s;s in before
it, and thus force it upwards. But there being a greater quantity
of the fir&s;t element than what was nece&s;&s;ary to fill up the inter&s;tices
of the &s;econd, it was nece&s;&s;arily accumulated in the center of each of
the&s;e great circular &s;treams, and formed there the firey and active
&s;ub&s;tance of the Sun. For, according to that philo&s;opher, the Solar
Sy&s;tems were infinite in number, each Fixed Star being the center
of one: and he is among the fir&s;t of the moderns, who thus took
<PB N="79" REF="172">
away the boundaries of the Univer&s;e; even Copernicus and Kepler,
them&s;elves, having confined it within, what they &s;uppo&s;ed, the vault
of the Firmament.</P>
<P>The center of each vortex being thus occupied by the mo&s;t active
and moveable parts of matter, there was nece&s;&s;arily among them, a
more violent agitation than in any other part of the vortex, and this
violent agitation of the center cheri&s;hed and &s;upported the movement
of the whole. But, among the particles of the fir&s;t element, which
fill up the inter&s;tices of the &s;econd, there are many, which, from
the pre&s;&s;ure of the globules on all &s;ides of them, nece&s;&s;arily receive
an angular form, and thus con&s;titute a third element of particles le&s;s
fit for motion than tho&s;e of the other two. As the particles, however,
of this third element were formed in the inter&s;tices of the &s;econd, they
are nece&s;&s;arily &s;maller than tho&s;e of the &s;econd, and are, therefore,
along with tho&s;e of the fir&s;t, urged down towards the center, where,
when a number of them happen to take hold of one another, they form
&s;uch &s;pots upon the &s;urface of the accumulated particles of the fir&s;t
element, as are often di&s;covered by tele&s;copes upon the face of that
Sun, which enlightens and animates our particular &s;y&s;tem. Tho&s;e
&s;pots are often broken and di&s;pelled, by the violent agitation of the
particles of the fir&s;t element, as has hitherto happily been the ca&s;e
with tho&s;e which have &s;ucce&s;&s;ively been formed upon the face of our
Sun. Sometimes, however, they encru&s;t the whole &s;urface of that
fire which is accumulated in the center; and the communication be|twixt
the mo&s;t active and the mo&s;t inert parts of the vortex being
thus interrupted, the rapidity of its motion immediately begins to
langui&s;h, and can no longer defend it from being &s;wallowed up and
carried away by the &s;uperior violence of &s;ome other like circular
&s;tream; and in this manner, what was once a Sun, becomes a
Planet. Thus, the time was, according to this &s;y&s;tem, when the Moon
was a body of the &s;ame kind with the Sun, the firey center of a cir|cular
<PB N="80" REF="173">
&s;tream of ether, which flowed continually round her; but her
face having been cru&s;ted over by a congeries of angular particles, the
motion of this circular &s;tream began to langui&s;h, and could no longer
defend it&s;elf from being ab&s;orbed by the more violent vortex of the
Earth, which was then, too, a Sun, and which chanced to be placed in
its neighbourhood. The Moon, therefore, became a Planet, and
revolved round the Earth. In proce&s;s of time, the &s;ame fortune,
which had thus befallen the Moon, befell al&s;o the Earth; its face was
encru&s;ted by a gro&s;s and inactive &s;ub&s;tance; the motion of its vortex
began to langui&s;h, and it was ab&s;orbed by the greater vortex of the
Sun: but though the vortex of the Earth had thus become languid,
it &s;till had force enough to occa&s;ion both the diurnal revolution of the
Earth, and the monthly motion of the Moon. For a &s;mall circular
&s;tream may ea&s;ily be conceived as flowing round the body of the
Earth, at the &s;ame time that it is carried along by that great ocean of
ether which is continually revolving round the Sun; in the &s;ame
manner, as in a great whirlpool of water, one may often &s;ee &s;everal
&s;mall whirlpools, which revolve round centers of their own, and
at the &s;ame time are carried round the center of the great one.
Such was the cau&s;e of the original formation and con&s;equent motions
of the Planetary Sy&s;tem. When a &s;olid body is turned round its
center, tho&s;e parts of it, which are neare&s;t, and tho&s;e which are re|mote&s;t
from the center, complete their revolutions in one and the
&s;ame time. But it is otherwi&s;e with the revolutions of a fluid: the
parts of it which are neare&s;t the center complete their revolutions in
a &s;horter time, than tho&s;e which are remoter. The Planets, there|fore,
all floating in that immen&s;e tide of ether which is continually
&s;etting in from we&s;t to ea&s;t round the body of the Sun, complete
their revolutions in a longer or a &s;horter time, according to their
nearne&s;s or di&s;tance from him. There was, however, according to
Des Cartes, no very exact proportion ob&s;erved betwixt the times of
their revolutions and their di&s;tances from the center. For that nice
<PB N="81" REF="174">
analogy, which Kepler had di&s;covered betwixt them, having not yet
been confirmed by the ob&s;ervations of Ca&s;&s;ini, was, as I before took
notice, entirely di&s;regarded by Des Cartes. According to him, too,
their orbits might not be perfectly circular, but be longer the one way
than the other, and thus approach to an Ellip&s;e. Nor yet was it
nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uppo&s;e, that they de&s;cribed this figure with geometrical
accuracy, or even that they de&s;cribed always preci&s;ely the &s;ame figure.
It rarely happens, that nature can be mathematically exact with regard
to the figure of the objects &s;he produces, upon account of the
infinite combinations of impul&s;es, which mu&s;t con&s;pire to the pro|duction
of each of her effects. No two Planets, no two animals of
the &s;ame kind, have exactly the &s;ame figure, nor is that of any one
of them perfectly regular. It was in vain, therefore, that a&s;trono|mers
laboured to find that perfect con&s;tancy and regularity in the
motions of the heavenly bodies, which is to be found in no other
parts of nature. The&s;e motions, like all others, mu&s;t either lan|gui&s;h
or be accelerated, according as the cau&s;e which produces them,
the revolution of the vortex of the Sun, either langui&s;hes, or is ac|celerated;
and there are innumerable events which may occa&s;ion
either the one or the other of tho&s;e changes.</P>
<P>It was thus, that Des Cartes endeavoured to render familiar to the
imagination, the greate&s;t difficulty in the Copernican &s;y&s;tem, the rapid
motion of the enormous bodies of the Planets. When the fancy
had thus been taught to conceive them as floating in an im|men&s;e
ocean of ether, it was quite agreeable to its u&s;ual habits to
conceive, that they &s;hould follow the &s;tream of this ocean, how
rapid &s;oever. This was an order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to which it had been
long accu&s;tomed, and with which it was, therefore, quite familiar.
This account, too, of the motions of the Heavens, was connected
with a va&s;t, an immen&s;e &s;y&s;tem, which joined together a greater
number of the mo&s;t di&s;cordant phaenomena of nature, than had
<PB N="82" REF="175">
been united by any other hypothe&s;is; a &s;y&s;tem in which the principles
of connection, though perhaps equally imaginary, were, however,
more di&s;tinct and determinate, than any that had been known before;
and which attempted to trace to the imagination, not only the order
of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion by which the heavenly bodies were moved, but that by
which they, and almo&s;t all other natural objects, had originally been
produced.&mdash;The Carte&s;ian philo&s;ophy begins now to be almo&s;t
univer&s;ally rejected, while the Copernican &s;y&s;tem continues to be
univer&s;ally received. Yet, it is not ea&s;y to imagine, how much
probability and coherence this admired &s;y&s;tem was long &s;uppo&s;ed to
derive from that exploded hypothe&s;is. Till Des Cartes had publi&s;hed
his principles, the disjointed and incoherent &s;y&s;tem of Tycho Brahe,
though it was embraced heartily and completely by &s;carce any body,
was yet con&s;tantly talked of by all the learned, as, in point of pro|bability,
upon a level with that of Copernicus. They took notice,
indeed, of its inferiority with regard to coherence and connection,
expre&s;&s;ing hopes, however, that the&s;e defects might be remedied by
&s;ome future improvements. But when the world beheld that com|plete,
and almo&s;t perfect coherence, which the philo&s;ophy of Des
Cartes be&s;towed upon the &s;y&s;tem of Copernicus, the imaginations of
mankind could no longer refu&s;e them&s;elves the plea&s;ure of going
along with &s;o harmonious an account of things. The &s;y&s;tem of Tycho
Brahe was every day le&s;s and le&s;s talked of, till at la&s;t it was for|gotten
altogether.</P>
<P>The &s;y&s;tem of Des Cartes, however, though it connected together the
real motions of the heavenly bodies according to the &s;y&s;tem of Coper|nicus,
more happily than had been done before, did &s;o only when they
were con&s;idered in the gro&s;s; but did not apply to them, when they were
regarded in the detail. Des Cartes, as was &s;aid before, had never him&s;elf
ob&s;erved the Heavens with any particular application. Though he was
not ignorant, therefore, of any of the ob&s;ervations which had been
<PB N="83" REF="176">
made before his time, he &s;eems to have paid them no great degree
of attention; which, probably, proceeded from his own inexperience
in the &s;tudy of A&s;tronomy. So far, therefore, from accommodating
his &s;y&s;tem to all the minute irregularities, which Kepler had a&s;cer|tained
in the movements of the Planets; or from &s;hewing, par|ticularly,
how the&s;e irregularities, and no other, &s;hould ari&s;e from it,
he contented him&s;elf with ob&s;erving, that perfect uniformity could
not be expected in their motions, from the nature of the cau&s;es which
produced them; that certain irregularities might take place in them,
for a great number of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive revolutions, and afterwards give way
to others of a different kind: a remark which, happily, relieved him
from the nece&s;&s;ity of applying his &s;y&s;tem to the ob&s;ervations of
Kepler, and the other A&s;tronomers.</P>
<P>But when the ob&s;ervations of Ca&s;&s;ini had e&s;tabli&s;hed the authority
of tho&s;e laws, which Kepler had fir&s;t di&s;covered in the &s;y&s;tem, the
philo&s;ophy of Des Cartes, which could afford no rea&s;on, why &s;uch
particular laws &s;hould be ob&s;erved, might continue to amu&s;e the
learned in other &s;ciences, but could no longer &s;atisfy tho&s;e that were
&s;killed in A&s;tronomy. Sir I&s;aac Newton fir&s;t attempted to give a
phy&s;ical account of the motions of the Planets, which &s;hould accom|modate
it&s;elf to all the con&s;tant irregularities which a&s;tronomers had
ever ob&s;erved in their motions. The phy&s;ical connection, by which
Des Cartes had endeavoured to bind together the movements of the
Planets, was the laws of impul&s;e; of all the orders of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion,
tho&s;e which are mo&s;t familiar to the imagination; as they all flow
from the inertne&s;s of matter. After this quality, there is no other,
with which we are &s;o well acquainted, as that of gravity. We
never act upon matter, but we have occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve it. The &s;u|perior
genius and &s;agacity of Sir I&s;aac Newton, therefore, made
the mo&s;t happy, and, we may now &s;ay, the greate&s;t and mo&s;t ad|mirable
improvement that was ever made in philo&s;ophy, when he
<PB N="84" REF="177">
di&s;covered, that he could join together the movements of the Planets
by &s;o familiar a principle of connection, which completely removed
all the difficulties the imagination had hitherto felt in attending to them.
He demon&s;trated, that, if the Planets were &s;uppo&s;ed to gravitate to|wards
the Sun, and to one another, and at the &s;ame time to have had
a projecting force originally impre&s;&s;ed upon them, the primary ones
might all de&s;cribe ellip&s;es in one of the foci of which that great
luminary was placed; and the &s;econdary ones might de&s;cribe figures
of the &s;ame kind round their re&s;pective primaries, without being
di&s;turbed by the continual motion of the centers of their revolutions.
That if the force, which retained each of them in their orbits, was
like that of gravity, and directed towards the Sun, they would,
each of them, de&s;cribe equal areas in equal times. That if this
attractive power of the Sun, like all other qualities which are diffu&s;ed
in rays from a center, dimini&s;hed in the &s;ame proportion as the
&s;quares of the di&s;tances increa&s;ed, their motions would be &s;wifte&s;t
when neare&s;t the Sun, and &s;lowe&s;t when farthe&s;t off from him, in the
&s;ame proportion in which, by ob&s;ervation, they are di&s;covered to be;
and that, upon the &s;ame &s;uppo&s;ition, of this gradual diminution of
their re&s;pective gravities, their periodic times would bear the &s;ame
proportion to their di&s;tances, which Kepler and Ca&s;&s;ini had e&s;tabli&s;hed
betwixt them. Having thus &s;hown, that gravity might be the con|necting
principle which joined together the movements of the
Planets, he endeavoured next to prove that it really was &s;o. Ex|perience
&s;hews us, what is the power of gravity near the &s;urface of
the Earth. That it is &s;uch as to make a body fall, in the fir&s;t &s;econd
of its de&s;cent, through about fifteen Pari&s;ian feet. The Moon is
about &s;ixty &s;emidiameters of the Earth di&s;tant from its &s;urface. If
gravity, therefore, was &s;uppo&s;ed to dimini&s;h, as the &s;quares of the
di&s;tance increa&s;e, a body, at the Moon, would fall towards the Earth
in a minute; that is, in &s;ixty &s;econds, through the &s;ame &s;pace,
which it falls near its &s;urface in one &s;econd. But the arch which the
<PB N="85" REF="178">
Moon de&s;cribes in a minute, falls, by ob&s;ervation, about fifteen
Pari&s;ian feet below the tangent drawn at the beginning of it. So far,
therefore, the Moon may be conceived as con&s;tantly falling towards the
Earth.</P>
<P>The &s;y&s;tem of Sir I&s;aac Newton corre&s;ponded to many other
irregularities which A&s;tronomers had ob&s;erved in the Heavens. It
a&s;&s;igned a rea&s;on, why the centers of the revolutions of the Planets
were not preci&s;ely in the center of the Sun, but in the common cen|ter
of gravity of the Sun and the Planets. From the mutual at|traction
of the Planets, it gave a rea&s;on for &s;ome other irregularities
in their motions; irregularities, which are quite &s;en&s;ible in tho&s;e of
Jupiter and Saturn, when tho&s;e Planets are nearly in conjunction
with one another. But of all the irregularities in the Heavens, tho&s;e
of the Moon had hitherto given the greate&s;t perplexity to A&s;tro|nomers;
and the &s;y&s;tem of Sir I&s;aac Newton corre&s;ponded, if po&s;|&s;ible,
yet more accurately with them than with any of the other Pla|nets.
The Moon, when either in conjunction, or in oppo&s;ition to
the Sun, appears furthe&s;t from the Earth, and neare&s;t to it when in
her quarters. According to the &s;y&s;tem of that philo&s;opher, when &s;he
is in conjunction with the Sun, &s;he is nearer the Sun than the Earth
is; con&s;equently, more attracted to him, and, therefore, more &s;epa|rated
from the Earth. On the contrary, when in oppo&s;ition to the
Sun, &s;he is further from the Sun than the Earth. The Earth, there|fore,
is more attracted to the Sun; and, con&s;equently, in this ca&s;e,
too, further &s;eparated from the Moon. But, on the other hand,
when the Moon is in her quarters, the Earth and the Moon, being
both at equal di&s;tance from the Sun, are equally attracted to him.
They would not, upon this account alone, therefore, be brought
nearer to one another. As it is not in parallel lines, however, that
they are attracted towards the Sun, but in lines which meet in his
center, they are, thereby, &s;till further approached to one another.
<PB N="86" REF="179">
Sir I&s;aac Newton computed the difference of the forces, with which
the Moon and the Earth ought, in all tho&s;e different &s;ituations, ac|cording
to his theory, to be impelled towards one another; and found,
that the different degrees of their approaches, as they had been ob|&s;erved
by A&s;tronomers, corre&s;ponded exactly to his computations.
As the attraction of the Sun, in the conjunctions and oppo&s;itions,
dimini&s;hes the gravity of the Moon towards the Earth, and, con&s;e|quently,
makes her nece&s;&s;arily extend her orbit, and, therefore, re|quire
a longer periodical time to fini&s;h it. But, when the Moon and
the Earth are in that part of the orbit which is neare&s;t the Sun, this
attraction of the Sun will be the greate&s;t; con&s;equently, the gravity
of the Moon towards the Earth, will there be mo&s;t dimini&s;hed; her
orbit be mo&s;t extended; and her periodic time be, therefore, the
longe&s;t. This is, al&s;o, agreeable to experience, and in the very &s;ame
proportion, in which, by computation, from the&s;e principles, it
might be expected.</P>
<P>The orbit of the Moon is not preci&s;ely in the &s;ame Plane with that
of the Earth; but makes a very &s;mall angle with it. The points of
inter&s;ection of tho&s;e two Planes, are called, the Nodes of the Moon.
The&s;e Nodes of the Moon are in continual motion, and in eighteen
or nineteen years, revolve backwards, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, through all
the different points of the Ecliptic. For the Moon, after having
fini&s;hed her periodical revolution, generally inter&s;ects the orbit of the
Earth &s;omewhat behind the point where &s;he had inter&s;ected it before.
But, though the motion of the Nodes is thus generally retrograde, it
is not always &s;o, but is &s;ometimes direct, and &s;ometimes they appear
even &s;tationary; the Moon generally inter&s;ects the Plane of the
Earth's orbit, behind the point where &s;he had inter&s;ected it in her
former revolution; but &s;he &s;ometimes inter&s;ects it before that point,
and &s;ometimes in the very &s;ame point. It is the &s;ituation of tho&s;e
Nodes which determines the times of Eclip&s;es, and their motions had,
upon this account, at all times, been particularly attended to by A&s;tro|nomers.
<PB N="87" REF="180">
Nothing, however, had perplexed them more, than to ac|count
for the&s;e &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent motions, and, at the &s;ame time, pre|&s;erve
their &s;o much &s;ought-for regularity in the revolutions of the
Moon. For they had no other means of connecting the appearances
together, than by &s;uppo&s;ing the motions which produced them, to be,
in reality, perfectly regular and equable. The hi&s;tory of A&s;tronomy,
therefore, gives an account of a greater number of theories invented
for connecting together the motions of the Moon, than for connect|ing
together tho&s;e of all the other heavenly bodies taken together.
The theory of gravity, connected together, in the mo&s;t accurate
manner, by the different actions of the Sun and the Earth, all tho&s;e
irregular motions; and it appears, by calculation, that the time, the
quantity, and the duration of tho&s;e direct and retrograde motions of
the Nodes, as well as of their &s;tationary appearances, might be ex|pected
to be exactly &s;uch, as the ob&s;ervations of A&s;tronomers have
determined them.</P>
<P>The &s;ame principle, the attraction of the Sun, which thus ac|counts
for the motions of the Nodes, connects, too, another very
perplexing irregularity in the appearances of the Moon; the per|petual
variation in the inclination of her orbit to that of the
Earth.</P>
<P>As the Moon revolves in an ellip&s;e, which has the centre of the
Earth in one of its foci, the longer axis of its orbit is called the
Line of its Ap&s;ides. This line is found, by ob&s;ervation, not to be
always directed towards the &s;ame points of the Firmament, but
to revolve forwards, from we&s;t to ea&s;t, &s;o as to pa&s;s through all
the points of the Ecliptic, and to complete its period in about
nine years; another irregularity, which had very much perplexed
A&s;tronomers, but which the theory of gravity &s;ufficiently accounted
for.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="181">
The Earth had hitherto been regarded as perfectly globular, pro|bably
for the &s;ame rea&s;on which had made men imagine, that the
orbits of the Planets mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be perfectly circular. But Sir
I&s;aac Newton, from mechanical principles, concluded, that, as the
parts of the Earth mu&s;t be more agitated by her diurnal revolution
at the Equator, than at the Poles, they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;ome|what
elevated at the fir&s;t, and flattened at the &s;econd. The ob&s;erva|tion,
that the o&s;cillations of pendulums were flower at the Equator
than at the Poles, &s;eeming to demon&s;trate, that gravity was
&s;tronger at the Poles, and weaker at the Equator, proved, he thought,
that the Equator was further from the centre than the Poles. All
the mea&s;ures, however, which had hitherto been made of the Earth,
&s;eemed to &s;how the contrary, that it was drawn out towards the
Poles, and flattened towards the Equator. Newton, however, pre|ferred
his mechanical computations to the former mea&s;ures of Geo|graphers
and A&s;tronomers; and in this he was confirmed by the ob|&s;ervations
of A&s;tronomers on the figure of Jupiter, who&s;e diameter
at the Pole &s;eems to be to his diameter at the Equator, as twelve to
thirteen; a much greater inequality than could be &s;uppo&s;ed to take
place betwixt the corre&s;pondent diameters of the Earth, but which
was exactly proportioned to the &s;uperior bulk of Jupiter, and the
&s;uperior rapidity with which he performs his diurnal revolutions.
The ob&s;ervations of A&s;tronomers at Lapland and Peru have fully
confirmed Sir I&s;aac's &s;y&s;tem, and have not only demon&s;trated, that
the figure of the Earth is, in general, &s;uch as he &s;uppo&s;ed it; but
that the proportion of its axis to the diameter of its Equator is al|mo&s;t
preci&s;ely &s;uch as he had computed it. And of all the proofs
that have ever been adduced of the diurnal revolution of the Earth,
this perhaps is the mo&s;t &s;olid and &s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>Hipparchus, by comparing his own ob&s;ervations with tho&s;e of
&s;ome former A&s;tronomers, had found that the equinoxial points were
<PB N="89" REF="182">
not always oppo&s;ite to the &s;ame part of the Heavens, but that they ad|vanced
gradually ea&s;tward by &s;o &s;low a motion, as to be &s;carce &s;en&s;ible
in one hundred years, and which would require thirty-&s;ix thou&s;and to
make a complete revolution of the Equinoxes, and to carry them
&s;ucce&s;&s;ively through all the different points of the Ecliptic. More
accurate ob&s;ervations di&s;covered that this proce&s;&s;ion of the Equi|noxes
was not &s;o &s;low as Hipparchus had imagined it, and that it
required &s;omewhat le&s;s than twenty-&s;ix thou&s;and years to give them a
complete revolution. While the ancient &s;y&s;tem of A&s;tronomy, which
repre&s;ented the Earth as the immoveable centre of the univer&s;e, took
place, this appearance was nece&s;&s;arily accounted for, by &s;uppo&s;ing
that the Firmament, be&s;ides its rapid diurnal revolution round the
poles of the Equator, had likewi&s;e a &s;low periodical one round tho&s;e
of the Ecliptic. And when the &s;y&s;tem of Hipparchus was by the
&s;choolmen united with the &s;olid Spheres of Ari&s;totle, they placed a new
chri&s;taline Sphere above the Firmament, in order to join this motion
to the re&s;t. In the Copernican &s;y&s;tem, this appearance had hitherto
been connected with the other parts of that hypothe&s;is, by &s;uppo&s;ing
a &s;mall revolution in the Earth's axis from ea&s;t to we&s;t. Sir I&s;aac
Newton connected this motion by the &s;ame principle of gravity, by
which he had united all the others, and &s;hewed, how the elevation
of the parts of the Earth at the Equator mu&s;t, by the attraction of
the Sun, produce the &s;ame retrograde motion of the Nodes of the
Ecliptic, which it produced of the Nodes of the Moon. He com|puted
the quantity of motion which could ari&s;e from this action of
the Sun, and his calculations here too entirely corre&s;ponded with the
ob&s;ervations of A&s;tronomers.</P>
<P>Comets had hitherto, of all the appearances in the Heavens, been
the lea&s;t attended to by A&s;tronomers. The rarity and incon&s;tancy of
their appearance, &s;eemed to &s;eparate them entirely from the con&s;tant,
regular, and uniform objects in the Heavens, and to make them re|&s;emble
<PB N="90" REF="183">
more the incon&s;tant, tran&s;itory, and accidental phaenomena
of tho&s;e regions that are in the neighbourhood of the Earth. Ari|&s;totle,
Eudoxus, Hipparchus, Ptolemy, and Purbach, therefore, had
all degraded them below the Moon, and ranked them among the
meteors of the upper regions of the air. The ob&s;ervations of Tycho
Brahe demon&s;trated, that they a&s;cended into the cele&s;tial regions,
and were often higher than Venus or the Sun. Des Cartes, at ran|dom,
&s;uppo&s;ed them to be always higher than even the orbit of Sa|turn;
and &s;eems, by the &s;uperior elevation he thus be&s;towed upon
them, to have been willing to compen&s;ate that unju&s;t degradation
which they had &s;uffered for &s;o many ages before. The ob&s;ervations
of &s;ome later A&s;tronomers demon&s;trated, that they too revolved
about the Sun, and might therefore be parts of the Solar Sy&s;tem.
Newton accordingly applied his mechanical principle of gravity to
explain the motions of the&s;e bodies. That they de&s;cribed equal areas
in equal times, had been di&s;covered by the ob&s;ervations of &s;ome later
A&s;tronomers; and Newton endeavoured to &s;how how from this prin|ciple,
and tho&s;e ob&s;ervations, the nature and po&s;ition of their &s;everal
orbits might be a&s;certained, and their periodic times determined.
His followers have, from his principles, ventured even to predict
the returns of &s;everal of them, particularly of one which is to make
its appearance in 1758<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the whole of this E&s;&s;ay was written previous to the date here mentioned; and that the return of the comet happened agreeably to the pre|diction.</NOTE>. We mu&s;t wait for that time before we can
determine, whether his philo&s;ophy corre&s;ponds as happily to this
part of the &s;y&s;tem as to all the others. In the mean time, however,
the ductility of this principle, which applied it&s;elf &s;o happily to
the&s;e, the mo&s;t irregular of all the cele&s;tial appearances, and which
has introduced &s;uch complete coherence into the motions of all the
Heavenly Bodies, has &s;erved not a little to recommend it to the ima|ginations
of mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="184">
But of all the attempts of the Newtonian Philo&s;ophy, that which
would appear to be the mo&s;t above the reach of human rea&s;on and ex|perience,
is the attempt to compute the weights and den&s;ities of the
Sun, and of the &s;everal Planets. An attempt, however, which was
indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to complete the coherence of the Newtonian
&s;y&s;tem. The power of attraction which, according to the theory
of gravity, each body po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, is in proportion to the quantity of
matter contained in that body. But the periodic time in which one
body, at a given di&s;tance, revolves round another that attracts it, is
&s;horter in proportion as this power is greater, and con&s;equently as the
quantity of matter in the attracting body. If the den&s;ities of Jupiter
and Saturn were the &s;ame with that of the Earth, the periodic times
of their &s;everal Satellites would be &s;horter than by ob&s;ervation they
are found to be. Becau&s;e the quantity of matter, and con&s;equently
the attracting power of each of them, would be as the cubes of their
diameters. By comparing the bulks of tho&s;e Planets, and the pe|riodic
times of their Satellites, it is found that, upon the hypothe&s;is
of gravity, the den&s;ity of Jupiter mu&s;t be greater than that of Sa|turn,
and the den&s;ity of the Earth greater than that of Jupiter.
This &s;eems to e&s;tabli&s;h it as a law in the &s;y&s;tem, that the nearer the
&s;everal Planets approach to the Sun, the den&s;ity of their matter is the
greater: a con&s;titution of things which would &s;eem to be the mo&s;t
advantageous of any that could have been e&s;tabli&s;hed; as water of
the &s;ame den&s;ity with that of our Earth, would freeze under the
Equator of Saturn, and boil under that of Mercury.</P>
<P>Such is the &s;y&s;tem of Sir I&s;aac Newton, a &s;y&s;tem who&s;e parts are
all more &s;trictly connected together, than tho&s;e of any other philo|&s;ophical
hypothe&s;is. Allow his principle, the univer&s;ality of gra|vity,
and that it decrea&s;es as the &s;quares of the di&s;tance increa&s;e,
and all the appearances, which he joins together by it, nece&s;&s;arily
follow. Neither is their connection merely a general and loo&s;e con|nection,
<PB N="92" REF="185">
as that of mo&s;t other &s;y&s;tems, in which either the&s;e appear|ances,
or &s;ome &s;uch like appearances, might indifferently have been
expected. It is every where the mo&s;t preci&s;e and particular that can be
imagined, and a&s;certains the time, the place, the quantity, the duration
of each individual phaenomenon, to be exactly &s;uch as, by ob&s;erva|tion,
they have been determined to be. Neither are the principles
of union, which it employs, &s;uch as the imagination can find any
difficulty in going along with. The gravity of matter is, of all its
qualities, after its inertne&s;s, that which is mo&s;t familiar to us. We
never act upon it without having occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve this pro|perty.
The law too, by which it is &s;uppo&s;ed to dimini&s;h as it re|cedes
from its centre, is the &s;ame which takes place in all other
qualities which are propagated in rays from a centre, in light, and
in every thing el&s;e of the &s;ame kind. It is &s;uch, that we not only
find that it does take place in all &s;uch qualities, but we are nece&s;|&s;arily
determined to conceive that, from the nature of the thing, it
mu&s;t take place. The oppo&s;ition which was made in France, and in
&s;ome other foreign nations, to the prevalence of this &s;y&s;tem, did not
ari&s;e from any difficulty which mankind naturally felt in conceiving
gravity as an original and primary mover in the con&s;titution of the
univer&s;e. The Carte&s;ian &s;y&s;tem, which had prevailed &s;o generally
before it, had accu&s;tomed mankind to conceive motion as never be|ginning,
but in con&s;equence of impul&s;e, and had connected the de|&s;cent
of heavy bodies, near the &s;urface of the Earth, and the other
Planets, by this more general bond of union; and it was the attach|ment
the world had conceived for this account of things, which in|di&s;po&s;ed
them to that of Sir I&s;aac Newton. His &s;y&s;tem, however,
now prevails over all oppo&s;ition, and has advanced to the acqui&s;ition
of the mo&s;t univer&s;al empire that was ever e&s;tabli&s;hed in philo&s;ophy.
His principles, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, have a degree of firmne&s;s
and &s;olidity that we &s;hould in vain look for in any other &s;y&s;tem.
The mo&s;t &s;ceptical cannot avoid feeling this. They not only con|nect
<PB N="93" REF="186">
together mo&s;t perfectly all the phaenomena of the Heavens,
which had been ob&s;erved before his time, but tho&s;e al&s;o which the
per&s;evering indu&s;try and more perfect in&s;truments of later A&s;trono|mers
have made known to us; have been either ea&s;ily and immedi|ately
explained by the application of his principles, or have been
explained in con&s;equence of more laborious and accurate calculations
from the&s;e principles, than had been in&s;tituted before. And even
we, while we have been endeavouring to repre&s;ent all philo&s;ophical
&s;y&s;tems as mere inventions of the imagination, to connect together
the otherwi&s;e disjointed and di&s;cordant phaenomena of nature, have
in&s;en&s;ibly been drawn in, to make u&s;e of language expre&s;&s;ing the
connecting principles of this one, as if they were the real chains
which Nature makes u&s;e of to bind together her &s;everal operations.
Can we wonder then, that it &s;hould have gained the general and
complete approbation of mankind, and that it &s;hould now be con|&s;idered,
not as an attempt to connect in the imagination the phaeno|mena
of the Heavens, but as the greate&s;t di&s;covery that ever was made
by man, the di&s;covery of an immen&s;e chain of the mo&s;t important and
&s;ublime truths, all clo&s;ely connected together, by one capital fact,
of the reality of which we have daily experience.</P>

<P>FROM arranging and methodizing the Sy&s;tem of the Heavens,
Philo&s;ophy de&s;cended to the con&s;ideration of the inferior parts
of Nature, of the Earth, and of the bodies which immediately &s;ur|round
it. If the objects, which were here pre&s;ented to its view,
were inferior in greatne&s;s or beauty, and therefore le&s;s apt to attract
the attention of the mind, they were more apt, when they came
to be attended to, to embarra&s;s and perplex it, by the variety of
their &s;pecies, and by the intricacy and &s;eeming irregularity of the
laws or orders of their &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The &s;pecies of objects in the
Heavens are few in number; the Sun, the Moon, the Planets, and
the Fixed Stars, are all which tho&s;e philo&s;ophers could di&s;tingui&s;h.
All the changes too, which are ever ob&s;erved in the&s;e bodies, evi|dently
ari&s;e from &s;ome difference in the velocity and direction of
their &s;everal motions; but the variety of meteors in the air, of
clouds, rainbows, thunder, lightning, winds, rain, hail, &s;now, is
va&s;tly greater; and the order of their &s;ucce&s;&s;ion &s;eems to be &s;till
more irregular and uncon&s;tant. The &s;pecies of fo&s;&s;ils, minerals,
plants, animals, which are found in the Waters, and near the &s;ur|face
of the Earth, are &s;till more intricately diver&s;ified; and if we

regard the different manners of their production, their mutual in|fluence
in altering, de&s;troying, &s;upporting one another, the orders
of their &s;ucce&s;&s;ion &s;eem to admit of an almo&s;t infinite variety. If
the imagination, therefore, when it con&s;idered the appearances in
the Heavens, was often perplexed, and driven out of its natural
career, it would be much more expo&s;ed to the &s;ame embarra&s;&s;ment,
when it directed its attention to the objects which the Earth pre|&s;ented
to it, and when it endeavoured to trace their progre&s;s and
&s;ucce&s;&s;ive revolutions.</P>
<P>To introduce order and coherence into the mind's conception of
this &s;eeming chaos of di&s;&s;imilar and disjointed appearances, it was
nece&s;&s;ary to deduce all their qualities, operations, and laws of &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion,
from tho&s;e of &s;ome particular things, with which it was
perfectly acquainted and familiar, and along which its imagination
could glide &s;moothly and ea&s;ily, and without interruption. But as
we would in vain attempt to deduce the heat of a &s;tove from that of
an open chimney, unle&s;s we could &s;how that the &s;ame fire which
was expo&s;ed in the one, lay concealed in the other; &s;o it was im|po&s;&s;ible
to deduce the qualities and laws of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, ob&s;erved in
the more uncommon appearances of Nature, from tho&s;e of &s;uch as
were more familiar, if tho&s;e cu&s;tomary objects were not &s;uppo&s;ed,
however di&s;gui&s;ed in their appearance, to enter into the compo&s;ition
of tho&s;e rarer and more &s;ingular phaenomena. To render, therefore,
this lower part of the great theatre of nature a coherent &s;pectacle to
the imagination, it became nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uppo&s;e, fir&s;t, That all the
&s;trange objects of which it con&s;i&s;ted were made up out of a few,
with which the mind was extremely familiar: and &s;econdly, That
all their qualities, operations, and rules of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, were no more
than different diver&s;ifications of tho&s;e to which it had long been
accu&s;tomed, in the&s;e primary and elementary objects.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="190">
Of all the bodies of which the&s;e inferior parts of the univer&s;e &s;eem
to be compo&s;ed, tho&s;e with which we are mo&s;t familiar, are the
Earth, which we tread upon; the Water, which we every day u&s;e;
the Air, which we con&s;tantly breath; and the Fire, who&s;e benign
influence is not only required for preparing the common nece&s;&s;aries
of life, but for the continual &s;upport of that vital principle which
actuates both plants and animals. The&s;e, therefore, were by Empe|docles,
and the other philo&s;ophers of the Italian &s;chool, &s;uppo&s;ed to
be the elements, out of which, at lea&s;t, all the inferior parts of na|ture
were compo&s;ed. The familiarity of tho&s;e bodies to the mind,
naturally di&s;po&s;ed it to look for &s;ome re&s;emblance to them in what|ever
el&s;e was pre&s;ented to its con&s;ideration. The di&s;covery of &s;ome
&s;uch re&s;emblance united the new object to an a&s;&s;ortment of things,
with which the imagination was perfectly acquainted. And if any
analogy could be ob&s;erved betwixt the operations and laws of &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
of the compound, and tho&s;e of the &s;imple objects, the move|ment
of the fancy, in tracing their progre&s;s, became quite &s;mooth,
and natural, and ea&s;y. This natural anticipation, too, was &s;till
more confirmed by &s;uch a &s;light and inaccurate analy&s;is of things, as
could be expected in the infancy of &s;cience, when the curio&s;ity of
mankind, gra&s;ping at an account of all things before it had got full
&s;atisfaction with regard to any one, hurried on to build, in imagi|nation,
the immen&s;e fabric of the univer&s;e. The heat, ob&s;erved in
both plants and animals, &s;eemed to demon&s;trate, that Fire made a
part of their compo&s;ition. Air was not le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ance
of both, and &s;eemed, too, to enter into the fabric of animals
by re&s;piration, and into that of plants by &s;ome other means. The
juices which circulated through them &s;howed how much of their
texture was owing to Water. And their re&s;olution into Earth by
putrefaction, di&s;covered that this element had not been left out in
their original formation. A &s;imilar analy&s;is &s;eemed to &s;hew the &s;ame
principles in mo&s;t other compound bodies.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="191">
The va&s;t extent of tho&s;e bodies &s;eemed to render them, upon an|other
account, proper to be the great &s;tores out of which nature
compounded all the other &s;pecies of things. Earth and Water di|vide
almo&s;t the whole of the terre&s;trial globe between them. The
thin tran&s;parent covering of the Air &s;urrounds it to an immen&s;e
height upon all &s;ides. Fire, with its attendant, light, &s;eems to de|&s;cend
from the cele&s;tial regions, and might, therefore, either be &s;up|po&s;ed
to be diffu&s;ed through the whole of tho&s;e aetherial &s;paces, as
well as to be conden&s;ed and conglobated in tho&s;e luminous bodies,
which &s;parkle acro&s;s them, as by the Stoics; or, to be placed im|mediately
under the &s;phere of the Moon, in the region next below
them, as by the Peripatetics, who could not reconcile the devouring
nature of Fire with the &s;uppo&s;ed unchangeable e&s;&s;ence of their &s;olid
and cry&s;talline &s;pheres.</P>
<P>The qualities, too, by which we are chiefly accu&s;tomed to cha|racterize
and di&s;tingui&s;h natural bodies, are all of them found, in the
highe&s;t degree in tho&s;e Four Elements. The great divi&s;ions of the
objects, near the &s;urface of the Earth, are tho&s;e into hot and cold,
mo&s;t and dry, light and heavy. The&s;e are the mo&s;t remarkable
properties of bodies; and it is upon them that many of their other
mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible qualities and powers &s;eem to depend. Of the&s;e, heat
and cold were naturally enough regarded by tho&s;e fir&s;t enquirers into
nature, as the active, moi&s;ture and dryne&s;s, as the pa&s;&s;ive qualities
of matter. It was the temperature of heat and cold which &s;eemed
to occa&s;ion the growth and di&s;&s;olution of plants and animals; as ap|peared
evident from the effects of the change of the &s;ea&s;ons upon
both. A proper degree of moi&s;ture and dryne&s;s was not le&s;s nece&s;|&s;ary
for the&s;e purpo&s;es; as was evident from the different effects
and productions of wet and dry &s;ea&s;ons and &s;oils. It was the heat
and cold, however, which actuated and determined tho&s;e two other|wi&s;e
inert qualities of things, to a &s;tate either of re&s;t or motion.
<PB N="101" REF="192">
Gravity and levity were regarded as the two principles of motion,
which directed all &s;ublunary things to their proper place: and all
tho&s;e &s;ix qualities, taken together, were, upon &s;uch an inattentive
view of nature, as mu&s;t be expected in the beginnings of philo&s;o|phy,
readily enough apprehended to be capable of connecting toge|ther
the mo&s;t remarkable revolutions, which occur in the&s;e inferior
parts of the univer&s;e. Heat and dryne&s;s were the qualities which
characterized the element of Fire; heat and moi&s;ture that of Air;
moi&s;ture and cold that of Water; cold and dryne&s;s that of Earth.
The natural motion of two of the&s;e elements, Earth and Water, was
downwards, upon account of their gravity. This tendency, how|ever,
was &s;tronger in the one than in the other, upon account of the
&s;uperior gravity of Earth. The natural motion of the two other ele|ments,
Fire and Air, was upwards, upon account of their levity;
and this tendency, too, was &s;tronger in the one than in the other,
upon account of the &s;uperior levity of Fire. Let us not de&s;pi&s;e
tho&s;e ancient philo&s;ophers, for thus &s;uppo&s;ing, that the&s;e two ele|ments
had a po&s;itive levity, or a real tendency upwards. Let us
remember, that this notion has an appearance of being confirmed by
the mo&s;t obvious ob&s;ervations; that tho&s;e facts and experiments, which
demon&s;trate the weight of the Air, and which no &s;uperior &s;agacity, but
chance alone, pre&s;ented to the moderns, were altogether unknown
to them; and that, what might, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, have &s;upplied the
place of tho&s;e experiments, the rea&s;onings concerning the cau&s;es of
the a&s;cent of bodies, in fluids &s;pecifically heavier than them&s;elves,
&s;eem to have been unknown in the ancient world, till Archimedes
di&s;covered them, long after their &s;y&s;tem of phy&s;ics was completed,
and had acquired an e&s;tabli&s;hed reputation: that tho&s;e rea&s;onings are
far from being obvious, and that by their inventor, they &s;eem to have
been thought applicable only to the a&s;cent of Solids in Water, and
not even to that of Solids in air, much le&s;s to that of one fluid in
another. But it is this la&s;t only which could explain the a&s;cent of
<PB N="102" REF="193">
flame, vapours, and fiery exhalations, without the &s;uppo&s;ition of a
&s;pecific levity.</P>
<P>Thus, each of tho&s;e Four Elements had, in the &s;y&s;tem of the uni|ver&s;e,
a place which was peculiarly allotted to it, and to which it
naturally tended. Earth and Water rolled down to the centre; the
Air &s;pread it&s;elf above them; while the Fire &s;oared alo&s;t, either to
the cele&s;tial region, or to that which was immediately below it.
When each of tho&s;e &s;imple bodies had thus obtained its proper
&s;phere, there was nothing in the nature of any one of them to make
it pa&s;s into the place of the other, to make the Fire de&s;cend into the
Air, the Air into the Water, or the Water into the Earth; or, on
the contrary, to bring up the Earth into the place of the Water, the
Water into that of the Air, or the Air into that of the Fire. All
&s;ublunary things, therefore, if left to them&s;elves, would have re|mained
in an eternal repo&s;e. The revolution of the heavens, tho&s;e
of the Sun, Moon, and Five Planets, by producing the vici&s;&s;itudes
of Day and Night, and of the Sea&s;ons, prevented this torpor and in|activity
from reigning through the inferior parts of nature; inflamed
by the rapidity of their circumvolutions, the element of Fire, and
forced it violently downwards into the Air, into the Water, and
into the Earth, and thereby produced tho&s;e mixtures of the different
elements which kept up the motion and circulation of the lower
parts of nature; occa&s;ioned, &s;ometimes, the entire tran&s;mutation of
one element into another, and &s;ometimes the production of forms
and &s;pecies different from them all, and in which, though the qua|lities
of them all might be found, they were &s;o altered and attem|pered
by the mixture, as &s;carce to be di&s;tingui&s;hable.</P>
<P>Thus, if a &s;mall quantity of Fire was mixed with a great quantity
of Air, the moi&s;ture and moderate warmth of the one entirely fur|mounted
and changed into their own e&s;&s;ence the inten&s;e heat and
<PB N="103" REF="194">
dryne&s;s of the other; and the whole aggregate became Air. The
contrary of which happened, if a &s;mall quantity of Air was mixed
with a great quantity of Fire: the whole, in this ca&s;e, became Fire.
In the &s;ame manner, if a &s;mall quantity of Fire was mixed with a
great quantity of Water, then, either the moi&s;ture and cold of the
Water might &s;urmount the heat and dryne&s;s of the Fire, &s;o as that
the whole &s;hould become Water; or, the moi&s;ture of the Water
might &s;urmount the dryne&s;s of the Fire, while, in its turn, the heat
of the Fire &s;urmounted the coldne&s;s of the Water, &s;o as that the
whole aggregate, its qualities being heat and moi&s;ture, &s;hould become
Air, which was regarded as the more natural and ea&s;y metamorpho&s;is
of the two. In the &s;ame manner they explained how like changes
were produced by the different mixtures of Fire and Earth, Earth
and Water, Water and Air, Air and Earth; and thus they connected
together the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive tran&s;mutations of the elements into one
another.</P>
<P>Every mixture of the Elements, however, did not produce an
entire tran&s;mutation. They were &s;ometimes &s;o blended together,
that the qualities of the one, not being able to de&s;troy, &s;erved only
to attemper tho&s;e of the other. Thus Fire, when mixed with water,
produced &s;ometimes a watery vapour, who&s;e qualities were heat and
moi&s;ture; which partook at once of the levity of the Fire, and of
the gravity of the Water, and which was elevated by the fir&s;t into
the Air, but retained by the la&s;t from a&s;cending into the region of
Fire. The relative cold, which they &s;uppo&s;ed prevailed in the mid|dle
region of the Air, upon account of its equal di&s;tance, both from
the region of Fire, and from the rays that are reflected by the &s;urface
of the Earth, conden&s;ed this vapour into Water; the Fire e&s;caped it,
and flew upwards, and the Water fell down in rain, or, according to
the different degrees of cold that prevailed in the different &s;ea&s;ons,
was &s;ometimes congealed into &s;now, and &s;ometimes into hail. In the
<PB N="104" REF="195">
&s;ame manner, Fire, when mixed with Earth, produced &s;ometimes a
fiery exhalation, who&s;e qualities were heat and dryne&s;s, which being
elevated by the levity of the fir&s;t into the Air conden&s;ed by the cold,
&s;o as to take fire, and being at the &s;ame time &s;urrounded by watery
vapours, bur&s;t forth into thunder and lightning, and other fiery
meteors. Thus they connected together the different appearances in
the Air, by the qualities of their Four Elements; and from them,
too, in the &s;ame manner, they endeavoured to deduce all the other
qualities in the other homogeneous bodies, that are near the &s;urface
of the Earth. Thus, to give an example, with regard to the hard|ne&s;s
and &s;oftne&s;s of bodies; heat and moi&s;ture, they ob&s;erved, were
the great &s;oftners of matter. Whatever was hard, therefore, owed
that quality either to the ab&s;ence of heat, or to the ab&s;ence of moi&s;|ture.
Ice, cry&s;tal, lead, gold, and almo&s;t all metals, owed their
hardne&s;s to the ab&s;ence of heat, and were, therefore, di&s;&s;olveable by
Fire. Rock-&s;alt, nitre, alum, and hard clay, owed that quality to
the ab&s;ence of moi&s;ture, and were, therefore, di&s;&s;olveable in water.
And, in the &s;ame manner, they endeavoured to connect together
mo&s;t of the other tangible qualities of matter. Their principles of
union, indeed, were often &s;uch as had no real exi&s;tence, and were
always vague and undetermined in the highe&s;t degree; they were
&s;uch, however, as might be expected in the beginnings of &s;cience,
and &s;uch as, with all their imperfections, could enable mankind both
to think and to talk, with more coherence, concerning tho&s;e general
&s;ubjects, than without them they would have been capable of doing.
Neither was their &s;y&s;tem entirely devoid either of beauty or magnifi|cence.
Each of the Four Elements having a particular region allot|ted
to it, had a place of re&s;t, to which it naturally tended, by its
motion, either up or down, in a &s;traight line, and where, when it
had arrived, it naturally cea&s;ed to move. Earth de&s;cended, till it ar|rived
at the place of Earth; Water, till it arrived at that of Water;
and Air, till it arrived at that of Air; and there each of them tended to a
<PB N="105" REF="196">
&s;tate of eternal repo&s;e and inaction. The Spheres con&s;i&s;ted of a
Fifth Element, which was neither light nor heavy, and who&s;e natu|ral
motion made it tend, neither to the center, nor from the center,
but revolve round it in a circle. As, by this motion, they could
never change their &s;ituation with regard to the center, they had no
place of repo&s;e, no place to which they naturally tended more than
to any other, but revolved round and round for ever. This Fifth
Element was &s;ubject neither to generation nor corruption, nor alter|ation
of any kind; for whatever changes may happen in the Heavens,
the &s;en&s;es can &s;carce perceive them, and their appearance is the &s;ame
in one age as in another. The beauty, too, of their &s;uppo&s;ed cry&s;|talline
&s;pheres &s;eemed &s;till more to entitle them to this di&s;tinction of
unchangeable immortality. It was the motion of tho&s;e Spheres,
which occa&s;ioned the mixtures of the Elements, and from thence,
the production of all the forms and &s;pecies, that diver&s;ify the world.
It was the approach of the Sun and of the other Planets, to the dif|ferent
parts of the Earth, which, by forcing down the element of
Fire, occa&s;ioned the generation of tho&s;e forms. It was the rece&s;s of
tho&s;e bodies, which, by allowing each Element to e&s;cape to its proper
&s;phere, brought about, in an equal time, their corruption. It was
the periods of tho&s;e great lights of Heaven, which mea&s;ured out to
all &s;ublunary things, the term of their duration, of their growth, and
of their decay, either in one, or in a number of &s;ea&s;ons, according
as the Elements of which they were compo&s;ed, were either imper|fectly
or accurately blended and mixed with one another. Immor|tality,
they could be&s;tow upon no individual form, becau&s;e the prin|ciples
out of which it was formed, all tending to di&s;engage them|&s;elves,
and to return to their proper &s;pheres, nece&s;&s;arily, at la&s;t,
brought about its di&s;&s;olution. But, though all individuals were thus
peri&s;hable, and con&s;tantly decaying, every &s;pecies was immortal,
becau&s;e the &s;ubject matter out of which they were made, and the
<PB N="106" REF="197">
revolution of the Heavens, the cau&s;e of their &s;ucce&s;&s;ive generations,
were always the &s;ame.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t ages of the world, the &s;eeming incoherence of the ap|pearances
of nature, &s;o confounded mankind, that they de&s;paired of
di&s;covering in her operations any regular &s;y&s;tem. Their ignorance,
and confu&s;ion of thought, nece&s;&s;arily gave birth to that pu&s;illanimous
&s;uper&s;tition, which a&s;cribes almo&s;t every unexpected event, to the
arbitrary will of &s;ome de&s;igning, though invi&s;ible beings, who pro|duced
it for &s;ome private and particular purpo&s;e. The idea of an
univer&s;al mind, of a God of all, who originally formed the whole,
and who governs the whole by general laws, directed to the con&s;er|vation
and pro&s;perity of the whole, without regard to that of any
private individual, was a notion to which they were utterly &s;trangers.
Their gods, though they were apprehended to interpo&s;e, upon &s;ome par|ticular
occa&s;ions, were &s;o far from being regarded, as the creators of
the world, that their origin was apprehended to be po&s;terior to that
of the world. The Earth, according to He&s;iod, was the fir&s;t pro|duction
of the chaos. The Heavens aro&s;e out of the Earth, and
from both together, all the gods, who afterwards inhabited them.
Nor was this notion confined to the vulgar, and to tho&s;e poets who
&s;eem to have recorded the vulgar theology. Of all the philo&s;ophers
of the Ionian &s;chool, Anaxagoras, it is well known, was the fir&s;t
who &s;uppo&s;ed, that mind and under&s;tanding were requi&s;ite to account
for the fir&s;t origin of the world, and who, therefore, compared
with the other philo&s;ophers of his time, talked, as Ari&s;totle ob&s;erves,
like a &s;ober man among drunkards; but who&s;e opinion was, at that
time, &s;o remarkable, that he &s;eems to have got a &s;irname from it.
The &s;ame notion, of the &s;pontaneous origin of the world, was em|braced,
too, as the &s;ame author tells us, by the early Pythagoreans,
a fect, which, in the antient world, was never regarded as irreligious.
<PB N="107" REF="198">
Mind, and under&s;tanding, and con&s;equently Deity, being the mo&s;t
perfect, were nece&s;&s;arily, according to them, the la&s;t productions of
Nature. For in all other things, what was mo&s;t perfect, they ob|&s;erved,
always came la&s;t. As in plants and animals, it is not the
&s;eed that is mo&s;t perfect, but the complete animal, with all its mem|bers,
in the one; and the complete plant, with all its branches,
leaves, flowers, and fruits, in the other. This notion, which could
take place only while Nature was &s;till con&s;idered as, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure,
di&s;orderly and incon&s;tant in her operations, was nece&s;&s;arily re|nounced
by tho&s;e philo&s;ophers, when, upon a more attentive &s;ur|vey,
they di&s;covered, or imagined they had di&s;covered, more di&s;|tinctly,
the chain which bound all her different parts to one another.
As &s;oon as the Univer&s;e was regarded as a complete machine, as a
coherent &s;y&s;tem, governed by general laws, and directed to general
ends, viz. its own pre&s;ervation and pro&s;perity, and that of all the &s;pe|cies
that are in it; the re&s;emblance which it evidently bore to tho&s;e
machines which are produced by human art, nece&s;&s;arily impre&s;&s;ed tho&s;e
&s;ages with a belief, that in the original formation of the world there
mu&s;t have been employed an art re&s;embling the human art, but as
much &s;uperior to it, as the world is &s;uperior to the machines which
that art produces. The unity of the &s;y&s;tem, which, according to this
ancient philo&s;ophy, is mo&s;t perfect, &s;ugge&s;ted the idea of the unity of
that principle, by who&s;e art it was formed; and thus, as ignorance
begot &s;uper&s;tition, &s;cience gave birth to the fir&s;t thei&s;m that aro&s;e
among tho&s;e nations, who were not enlightened by divine Revelation.
According to Timaeus, who was followed by Plato, that intelligent
Being, who formed the world, endowed it with a principle of life
and under&s;tanding, which extends from its centre to its remote&s;t cir|cumference,
which is con&s;cious of all its changes, and which governs
and directs all its motions to the great end of its formation. This
Soul of the world was it&s;elf a God, the greate&s;t of all the in|ferior,
and created deities; of an e&s;&s;ence that was indi&s;&s;oluble, by
<PB N="108" REF="199">
any power but by that of him who made it, and which was united
to the body of the world, &s;o as to be in&s;eparable by every force, but
his who joined them, from the exertion of which his goodne&s;s &s;e|cured
them. The beauty of the cele&s;tial &s;pheres attracting the ad|miration
of mankind, the con&s;tancy and regularity of their motions
&s;eeming to manife&s;t peculiar wi&s;dom and under&s;tanding, they were
each of them &s;uppo&s;ed to be animated by an Intelligence of a nature
that was, in the &s;ame manner, indi&s;&s;oluble and immortal, and in&s;e|parably
united to that &s;phere which it inhabited. All the mortal
and changeable beings which people the &s;urface of the earth were
formed by tho&s;e inferior deities; for the revolutions of the heavenly
bodies &s;eemed plainly to influence the generation and growth of
both plants and animals, who&s;e frail and fading forms bore the too
evident marks of the weakne&s;s of tho&s;e inferior cau&s;es, which joined
their different parts to one another. According to Plato and Ti|maeus,
neither the Univer&s;e, nor even tho&s;e inferior deities, who go|vern
the Univer&s;e, were eternal, but were formed in time, by the
great Author of all things, out of that matter which had exi&s;ted
from all eternity. This at lea&s;t their words &s;eem to import, and thus
they are under&s;tood by Cicero, and by all the other writers of earlier
antiquity, though &s;ome of the later Platoni&s;ts have interpreted them
differently.</P>
<P>According to Ari&s;totle, who &s;eems to have followed the doctrine
of Ocellus, the world was eternal; the eternal effect of an eternal
cau&s;e. He found it difficult, it would &s;eem, to conceive what could
hinder the Fir&s;t Cau&s;e from exerting his divine energy from all eter|nity.
At whatever time he began to exert it, he mu&s;t have, been at re&s;t
during all the infinite ages of that eternity which had pa&s;&s;ed before it.
To what ob&s;truction, from within or from without, could this be
owing? or how could this ob&s;truction, if it ever had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, have
ever been removed? His idea of the nature and manner of exi&s;t|ence
of this Fir&s;t Cau&s;e, as it is expre&s;&s;ed in the la&s;t book of his
<PB N="109" REF="200">
Phy&s;ics, and the five la&s;t chapters of his Metaphy&s;ics, is indeed
ob&s;cure and unintelligible in the highe&s;t degree, and has perplexed
his commentators more than any other parts of his writings. Thus
far, however, he &s;eems to expre&s;s him&s;elf plainly enough: that the
Fir&s;t Heavens, that of the Fixed Stars, from which are derived the
motions of all the re&s;t, is revolved by an eternal, immoveable, un|changeable,
unextended being, who&s;e e&s;&s;ence con&s;i&s;ts in intelligence,
as that of a body con&s;i&s;ts in &s;olidity and exten&s;ion; and which is
therefore nece&s;&s;arily and always intelligent, as a body is nece&s;|&s;arily
and always extended: that this Being was the fir&s;t and &s;u|preme
mover of the Univer&s;e: that the inferior Planetary Spheres
derived each of them its peculiar revolution from an inferior being
of the &s;ame kind; eternal, immoveable, unextended, and nece&s;&s;arily
intelligent: that the &s;ole object of the intelligence of tho&s;e beings
was their own e&s;&s;ence, and the revolution of their own &s;pheres; all
other inferior things being unworthy of their con&s;ideration; and
that therefore whatever was below the Moon was abandoned by the
gods to the direction of Nature, and Chance, and Nece&s;&s;ity. For
though tho&s;e cele&s;tial beings were, by the revolutions of their &s;everal
Spheres, the original cau&s;es of the generation and corruption of all
&s;ublunary forms, they were cau&s;es who neither knew nor intended
the effects which they produced. This renowned philo&s;opher &s;eems,
in his theological notions, to have been directed by prejudices which,
though extremely natural, are not very philo&s;ophical. The revo|lutions
of the Heavens, by their grandeur and con&s;tancy, excited
his admiration, and &s;eemed, upon that account, to be effects not un|worthy
a Divine Intelligence. Whereas the meanne&s;s of many
things, the di&s;order and confu&s;ion of all things below, exciting no
&s;uch agreeable emotion, &s;eemed to have no marks of being directed
by that Supreme Under&s;tanding. Yet, though this opinion &s;aps
the foundations of human wor&s;hip, and mu&s;t have the &s;ame effects
upon &s;ociety as Athei&s;m it&s;elf, one may ea&s;ily trace, in the Meta|phy&s;ics
<PB N="110" REF="201">
phy&s;ics upon which it is grounded, the origin of many of the no|tions,
or rather of many of the expre&s;&s;ions, in the &s;chola&s;tic theo|logy,
to which no notions can be annexed.</P>
<P>The Stoics, the mo&s;t religious of all the ancient fects of philo&s;o|phers,
&s;eem in this, as in mo&s;t other things, to have altered and
refined upon the doctrine of Plato. The order, harmony, and co|herence
which this philo&s;ophy be&s;towed upon the Univer&s;al Sy&s;tem,
&s;truck them with awe and veneration. As, in the rude ages of the
world, whatever particular part of Nature excited the admiration of
mankind, was apprehended to be animated by &s;ome particular divi|nity;
&s;o the whole of Nature having, by their rea&s;onings, become
equally the object of admiration, was equally apprehended to be
animated by a Univer&s;al Deity, to be it&s;elf a Divinity, an Animal;
a term which to our ears &s;eems by no means &s;ynonimous with the
foregoing; who&s;e body was the &s;olid and &s;en&s;ible parts of Nature,
and who&s;e &s;oul was that aetherial Fire, which penetrated and actuated
the whole. For of all the four elements, out of which all things
were compo&s;ed, Fire or Aether &s;eemed to be that which bore the
greate&s;t re&s;emblance to the Vital Principle which informs both plants
and animals, and therefore mo&s;t likely to be the Vital Principle
which animated the Univer&s;e. This infinite and unbounded Aether,
which extended it&s;elf from the centre beyond the remote&s;t circum|ference
of Nature, and was endowed with the mo&s;t con&s;ummate
rea&s;on and intelligence, or rather was it&s;elf the very e&s;&s;ence of rea|&s;on
and intelligence, had originally formed the world, and had
communicated a portion, or ray, of its own e&s;&s;ence to whatever was
endowed with life and &s;en&s;ation, which, upon the di&s;&s;olution of
tho&s;e forms, either immediately or &s;ometime after, was again ab|&s;orbed
into that ocean of Deity from whence it had originally been
detached. In this &s;y&s;tem the Sun, the Moon, the Planets, and the
Fixed Stars, were each of them al&s;o inferior divinities, animated by a
<PB N="111" REF="202">
detached portion of that aetherial e&s;&s;ence which was the &s;oul of the
world. In the &s;y&s;tem of Plato, the Intelligence which animated the
world was different from that which originally formed it. Neither
were the&s;e which animated the cele&s;tial &s;pheres, nor tho&s;e which
informed inferior terre&s;trial animals, regarded as portions of this
pla&s;tic &s;oul of the world. Upon the di&s;&s;olution of animals, therefore,
their &s;ouls were not ab&s;orbed in the &s;oul of the world, but had a &s;epa|rate
and eternal exi&s;tence, which gave birth to the notion of the tran&s;|migration
of &s;ouls. Neither did it &s;eem unnatural, that, as the &s;ame
matter which had compo&s;ed one animal body might be employed to
compo&s;e another, that the &s;ame intelligence which had animated one
&s;uch being &s;hould again animate another. But in the &s;y&s;tem of the
Stoics, the intelligence which originally formed, and that which
animated the world, were one and the &s;ame, all inferior intel|ligences
were detached portions of the great one; and therefore, in
a longer, or in a &s;horter time, were all of them, even the gods
them&s;elves, who animated the cele&s;tial bodies, to be at la&s;t re&s;olved
into the infinite e&s;&s;ence of this almighty Jupiter, who, at a de&s;tined
period, &s;hould, by an univer&s;al conflagration, wrap up all things, in
that aetherial and &s;iery nature, out of which they had originally
been deduced, again to bring forth a new Heaven and a new Earth,
new animals, new men, new deities; all of which would again, at
a fated time, be &s;wallowed up in a like conflagration, again to be
re-produced, and again to be re-de&s;troyed, and &s;o on without end.</P>

<HEAD>THE
HISTORY
OF THE
ANCIENT LOGICS and METAPHYSICS.</HEAD>
<P>IN every tran&s;mutation, either of one element into another, or of
one compound body, either into the elements out of which it
was compo&s;ed, or into another compound body, it &s;eemed evi|dent,
that, both in the old and in the new &s;pecies, there was
&s;omething that was the &s;ame, and &s;omething that was different.
When Fire was changed into Air, or Water into Earth, the Stuff,
or Subject-matter of this Air and this Earth, was evidently the
&s;ame with that of the former Fire or Water; but the Nature or Spe|cies
of tho&s;e new bodies was entirely different. When, in the
&s;ame manner, a number of fre&s;h, green, and odoriferous flowers
were thrown together in a heap, they, in a &s;hort time, entirely
changed their nature, became putrid and loath&s;ome, and di&s;&s;olved
into a confu&s;ed ma&s;s of ordure, which bore no re&s;emblance, either
in its &s;en&s;ible qualities or in its effects, to their former beautiful
appearance. But how different &s;oever the &s;pecies, the &s;ubject-matter
of the flowers, and of the ordure, was, in this ca&s;e too, evidently
the &s;ame. In every body, therefore, whether &s;imple or mixed,
there were evidently two principles, who&s;e combination con&s;tituted
the whole nature of that particular body. The fir&s;t was the Stuff,
or Subject-matter, out of which it was made; the &s;econd was the
<PB N="116" REF="205">
Species, the Specific E&s;&s;ence, the E&s;&s;ential, or, as the &s;choolmen have
called it, the Sub&s;tantial Form of the Body. The fir&s;t &s;eemed to be
the &s;ame in all bodies, and to have neither qualities nor powers of
any kind, but to be altogether inert and imperceptible by any of
the &s;en&s;es, till it was qualified and rendered &s;en&s;ible by its union
with &s;ome &s;pecies or e&s;&s;ential form. All the qualities and powers of
bodies &s;eemed to depend upon their &s;pecies or e&s;&s;ential forms. It
was not the &s;tuff or matter of Fire, or Air, or Earth, or Water, which
enabled tho&s;e elements to produce their &s;everal effects, but that
e&s;&s;ential form which was peculiar to each of them. For it &s;eemed
evident, that Fire mu&s;t produce the effects of Fire, by that which
rendered it Fire; Air, by that which rendered it Air; and that
in the &s;ame manner all other &s;imple and mixed bodies mu&s;t pro|duce
their &s;everal effects, by that which con&s;tituted them &s;uch
or &s;uch bodies; that is, by their &s;pecific E&s;&s;ence or e&s;&s;ential
forms. But it is from the effects of bodies upon one another,
that all the changes and revolutions in the material world ari&s;e.
Since the&s;e, therefore, depend upon the &s;pecific e&s;&s;ences of tho&s;e
bodies, it mu&s;t be the bu&s;ine&s;s of philo&s;ophy, that &s;cience which
endeavours to connect together all the different changes that oc|cur
in the world, to determine wherein the &s;pecific E&s;&s;ence of
each object con&s;i&s;ts, in order to fore&s;ee what changes or revolutions
may be expected from it. But the &s;pecific E&s;&s;ence of each indi|vidual
object is not that which is peculiar to it as an individual,
but that which is common to it, with all other objects of the &s;ame
kind. Thus the &s;pecific E&s;&s;ence of the Water, which now &s;tands
before me, does not con&s;i&s;t in its being heated by the Fire, or cooled
by the Air, in &s;uch a particular degree; in its being contained in a
ve&s;&s;el of &s;uch a form, or of &s;uch dimen&s;ions. The&s;e are all acci|dental
circum&s;tances, which are altogether extraneous to its general
nature, and upon which none of its effects as Water depend. Phi|lo&s;ophy,
therefore, in con&s;idering the general nature of Water, takes
<PB N="117" REF="206">
no notice of tho&s;e particularities which are peculiar to this Water,
but con&s;ines it&s;elf to tho&s;e things which are common to all water.
If, in the progre&s;s of its enquiries, it &s;hould de&s;cend to con&s;ider the
nature of Water that is modified by &s;uch particular accidents, it &s;till
would not con&s;ine its con&s;ideration to this water contained in this
ve&s;&s;el, and thus heated at this fire, but would extend its views to
Water in general contained in &s;uch kind of ve&s;&s;els, and heated to
&s;uch a degree at &s;uch a fire. In every ca&s;e, therefore, Species, or
Univer&s;als, and not Individuals, are the objects of Philo&s;ophy. Be|cau&s;e
whatever effects are produced by individuals, whatever changes
can flow from them, mu&s;t all proceed from &s;ome univer&s;al nature
that is contained in them. As it was the bu&s;ine&s;s of Phy&s;ics, or
Natural Philo&s;ophy, to determine wherein con&s;i&s;ted the Nature and
E&s;&s;ence of every particular Species of things, in order to connect to|gether
all the different events that occur in the material world;
&s;o there were two other &s;ciences, which, though they had ori|ginally
ari&s;en out of that &s;y&s;tem of Natural Philo&s;ophy I have ju&s;t
been de&s;cribing, were, however, apprehended to go before it, in the
order in which the knowledge of Nature ought to be communicated.
The fir&s;t of the&s;e, Metaphy&s;ics, con&s;idered the general nature of Uni|ver&s;als,
and the different forts or &s;pecies into which they might be
divided. The &s;econd of the&s;e, Logics, was built upon this doctrine
of Metaphy&s;ics; and from the general nature of Univer&s;als, and of
the &s;orts into which they were divided, endeavoured to a&s;certain the
general rules by which we might di&s;tribute all particular objects into
general cla&s;&s;es, and determine to what cla&s;s each individual object
belonged; for in this, they ju&s;tly enough apprehended, con&s;i&s;ted
the whole art of philo&s;ophical rea&s;oning. As the fir&s;t of the&s;e two
&s;ciences, Metaphy&s;ics, is altogether &s;ubordinate to the &s;econd, Logic,
they &s;eem, before the time of Ari&s;totle, to have been regarded as
one, and to have made up between them that ancient Dialectic of
which we hear &s;o much, and of which we under&s;tand &s;o little:
neither does this &s;eparation &s;eem to have been much attended to,
<PB N="118" REF="207">
either by his own followers, the ancient Peripatetics, or by any
other of the old &s;ects of philo&s;ophers. The later &s;choolmen, in|deed,
have di&s;tingui&s;hed between Ontology and Logic; but their
Ontology contains but a &s;mall part of what is the &s;ubject of the
metaphy&s;ical books of Ari&s;totle, the greater part of which, the doc|trines
of Univer&s;als, and every thing that is preparatory to the arts
of defining and dividing, has, &s;ince the days of Porphery, been in|&s;erted
into their Logic.</P>
<P>According to Plato and Timaeus, the principles out of which the
Deity formed the World, and which were them&s;elves eternal, were
three in number. The Subject-matter of things, the Species or
&s;pecific E&s;&s;ences of things, and what was made out of the&s;e, the
&s;en&s;ible objects them&s;elves. The&s;e la&s;t had no proper or durable
exi&s;tence, but were in perpetual flux and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. For as He|raclitus
had &s;aid, that no man ever pa&s;&s;ed the &s;ame river twice,
becau&s;e the water which he had pa&s;&s;ed over once was gone before
he could pa&s;s over it a &s;econd time; &s;o, in the &s;ame manner, no
man ever &s;aw, or heard, or touched the &s;ame &s;en&s;ible object twice.
When I look at the window, for example, the vi&s;ible &s;pecies,
which &s;trikes my eyes this moment, though re&s;embling, is dif|ferent
from that which &s;truck my eyes the immediately preceding
moment. When I ring the bell, the &s;ound, or audible &s;pecies
which I hear this moment, though re&s;embling in the &s;ame manner,
is different, however, from that which I heard the moment be|fore.
When I lay my hand on the table, the tangible &s;pecies which I
feel this moment, though re&s;embling, in the &s;ame manner, is nu|merically
different too from that which I felt the moment before.
Our &s;en&s;ations, therefore, never properly exi&s;t or endure one mo|ment;
but, in the very in&s;tant of their generation, peri&s;h and are
annihilated for ever. Nor are the cau&s;es of tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations more
permanent. No corporeal &s;ub&s;tance is ever exactly the &s;ame, either
in whole or in any a&s;&s;ignable part, during two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive moments,
<PB N="119" REF="208">
but by the perpetual addition of new parts, as well as lo&s;s of old
ones, is in continual flux and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Things of &s;o &s;teeting a
nature can never be the objects of &s;cience, or of any &s;teady or per|manent
judgment. While we look at them, in order to con&s;ider
them, they are changed and gone, and annihilated for ever. The
objects of &s;cience, and of all the &s;teady judgments of the under|&s;tanding,
mu&s;t be permanent, unchangeable, always exi&s;tent, and
liable neither to generation nor corruption, nor alteration of any
kind. Such are the &s;pecies or &s;pecific e&s;&s;ences of things. Man is
perpetually changing every particle of his body; and every thought
of his mind is in continual flux and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. But humanity, or
human nature, is always exi&s;tent, is always the &s;ame, is never
generated, and is never corrupted. This, therefore, is the object of
&s;cience, rea&s;on, and under&s;tanding, as man is the object of &s;en&s;e,
and of tho&s;e incon&s;tant opinions which are founded upon &s;en&s;e. As
the objects of &s;en&s;e were apprehended to have an external exi&s;tence,
independent of the act of &s;en&s;ation, &s;o the&s;e objects of the under|&s;tanding
were much more &s;uppo&s;ed to have an external exi&s;tence in|dependent
of the act of under&s;tanding. Tho&s;e external e&s;&s;ences
were, according to Plato, the exemplars, according to which the
Deity formed the world, and all the &s;en&s;ible objects that are in it.
The Deity comprehended within his infinite effence, all the&s;e &s;pecies,
or eternal exemplars, in the &s;ame manner as he comprehended all
&s;en&s;ible objects.</P>
<P>Plato, however, &s;eems to have regarded the fir&s;t of tho&s;e us
equally di&s;tinct with the &s;econd from what we would now call the
Ideas or Thoughts of the Divine Mind<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">He calls them, indeed, Ideas, a word which, in him, in Ari&s;totle, and all the other writers of earlier antiquity, &s;ignifies a Species, and is perfectly &s;ynonimous with that other word <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, more frequently made u&s;e of by Ari&s;totle. As, by &s;ome of the later &s;ects of philo&s;ophers, particularly by the Stoics, all &s;pecies, or &s;pecific e&s;&s;ences, were regarded as mere creatures of the mind, formed by ab&s;traction, which had no real exi&s;tence external to the thoughts that conceived them, the word Idea came, by degrees, to its pre&s;ent &s;ignification, to mean, fir&s;t, an ab&s;tract thought or conception; and afterwards, a thought or conception of any kind; and thus became &s;ynonymous with that other Greek word <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, from which it had originally a very different meaning. When the later Platoni&s;ts, who lived at a time when the notion of the &s;e|parate exi&s;tence of &s;pecific e&s;&s;ences were univer&s;ally exploded, began to comment upon the writings of Plato, and upon that &s;trange fancy that, in his writings, there was a double doctrine; and that they were intended to &s;eem to mean one thing, while at bottom they meant a very different, which the writings of no man in his &s;en&s;es ever were, or ever could be intended to do; they repre&s;ented his doctrine as meaning no more, than that the Deity formed the world after what we would now call an Idea, or plan conceived in his own mind, in the &s;ame manner as any other arti&s;t. But, if Plato had meant to expre&s;s no more than this mo&s;t natural and &s;imple of all notions, he might &s;urely have expre&s;&s;ed it more plainly, and would hardly, one would think, have talked of it with &s;o much empha&s;is, as of &s;omething which it required the utmo&s;t reach of thought to comprehend. According to this repre&s;entation, Plato's notion of Species, or Univer&s;als, was the &s;ame with that of Ari&s;totle. Ari&s;totle, however, does not &s;eem to under&s;tand it as &s;uch; he be&s;tows a great part of his Metaphy&s;ics upon confuting it, and oppo&s;es it in all his other works; nor does he, in any one of them, give the lea&s;t hint, or in&s;inuation, as if it could be &s;u&s;pected that, by the Ideas of Plato, was meant the thoughts or conceptions of the Divine Mind. Is it po&s;&s;ible that he, who was twenty years in his &s;chool, &s;hould, during all that time, have mi&s;under|&s;tood him, e&s;pecially when his meaning was &s;o very plain and obvious? Neither is this notion of the &s;eparate exi&s;tence of Species, di&s;tinct both from the mind which conceives them, and from the &s;en&s;ible objects which are made to re&s;emble them, one of tho&s;e doctrines which Plato would but &s;eldom have occa&s;ion to talk of. How|ever it may be interpreted, it is the very ba&s;is of his philo&s;ophy; neither is there a &s;ingle dialogue in all his works which does not refer to it. Shall we &s;uppo&s;e, that that great philo&s;opher, who appears to have been &s;o much &s;uperior to his ma&s;ter in every thing but eloquence, wilfully, and upon all occa&s;ions, mi&s;repre&s;ented, not one of the deep and my&s;terious doctrines of the philo&s;ophy of Plato, but the fir&s;t and mo&s;t fundamen|tal principle of all his rea&s;onings; when the writings of Plato were in the hands of everybody; when his followers and di&s;ciples were &s;pread all over Greece; when almo&s;t every Athenian of di&s;tinction, that was nearly of the &s;ame age with Ari&s;totle, mu&s;t have been bred in his &s;chool; when Speu&s;ippus, the nephew and &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Plato, as well as Xenocrates, who continued the &s;chool in the Academy, at the &s;ame time that Ari&s;totle held his in the Lyceum, mu&s;t have been ready, at all times, to expo&s;e and affront him for &s;uch gro&s;s di&s;ingenuity. Does not Cicero, does not Seneca under|&s;tand this doctrine in the &s;ame manner as Ari&s;totle has repre&s;ented it? Is there any author in all antiquity who &s;eems to under&s;tand it otherwi&s;e, earlier than Plutarch, an author, who &s;eems to have been as bad a critic in philo&s;ophy as in hi&s;tory, and to have taken every thing at &s;econd-hand in both, and who lived after the origin of that eclectic philo&s;ophy, from whence the later Platoni&s;ts aro&s;e, and who &s;eems him&s;elf to have been one of that &s;ect? Is there any one pa&s;&s;age in any Greek author, near the time of Ari&s;totle and Plato, in which the word Idea is u&s;ed in its pre&s;ent meaning, to &s;ignify a thought or conception? Are not the words, which in all languages expre&s;s reality or exi&s;tence, directly oppo&s;ed to tho&s;e which expre&s;s thought, or conception only? Or, is there any other difference betwixt a thing that exi&s;ts, and a thing that does not exi&s;t, except this, that the one is a mere conception, and that the other is &s;omething more than a conception? With what propriety, therefore, could Plato talk of tho&s;e eternal &s;pecies, as of the only things which had any real exi&s;tence, if they were no more than the conceptions of the Divine Mind? Had not the Deity, according to Plato, as well as according to the Stoics, from all eternity, the idea of every individual, as well as of every &s;pecies, and of the &s;tate in which every indi|vidual was to be, in each different in&s;tance of its exi&s;tence? Were not all the divine ideas, therefore, of each individual, or of all the different &s;tates, which each indi|vidual was to be in during the cour&s;e of its exi&s;tence, equally eternal and unalterable with tho&s;e of the &s;pecies? With what &s;en&s;e, therefore, could Plato &s;ay, that the fir&s;t were eternal, becau&s;e the Deity had conceived them from all eternity, &s;ince he had conceived the others from all eternity too, and &s;ince his ideas of the Species could, in this re&s;pect, have no advantage of tho&s;e of the individual? Does not Plato, in many different places, talk of the Ideas of Species or Univer&s;als as innate, and having been impre&s;&s;ed upon the mind in its &s;tate of pre-exi&s;tence, when it had an opportu|nity of viewing the&s;e Species as they are in them&s;elves, and not as they are expre&s;&s;ed in their copies, or repre&s;entative upon earth? But if the only place of the exi&s;tence of tho&s;e Species was the Divine Mind, will not this &s;uppo&s;e, that Plato either ima|gined, like Father Malbranche, that in its &s;tate of pre-exi&s;tence, the mind &s;aw all things in God; or that it was it&s;elf an emanation of the Divinity? That he main|tained the fir&s;t opinion, will not be pretended by any body who is at all ver&s;ed in the hi&s;tory of &s;cience. That enthu&s;ia&s;tic notion, though it may &s;eem to be favoured by &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in the Fathers, was never, it is well known, coolly and literally main|tained by any body before that Carte&s;ian philo&s;opher. That the human mind was it&s;elf an emanation of the Divine, though it was the doctrine of the Stoics, was by no means that of Plato; though, upon the notion of a pretended double doctrine, the contrary has lately been a&s;&s;erted. According to Plato, the Deity formed the &s;oul of the world out of that &s;ub&s;tance which is always the &s;ame, that is, out of Species or Univer&s;als; out of that which is always different, that is, out of corporeal &s;ub|&s;tances; and out of a &s;ub&s;tance that was of a middle nature between the&s;e, which it is not ea&s;y to under&s;tand what he meant by. Out of a part of the &s;ame compo&s;ition, he made tho&s;e inferior intelligences who animated the cele&s;tial &s;pheres, to whom he delivered the remaining part of it, to form from thence the &s;ouls of men and ani|mals. The &s;ouls of tho&s;e inferior deities, though made out of a &s;imilar &s;ub&s;tance or compo&s;ition, were not regarded as parts, or emanations of that of the world; nor were tho&s;e of animals, in the &s;ame manner, regarded as parts or emanations of tho&s;e inferior deities; much le&s;s were any of them regarded as parts, or emanations of the great Author of all things.</NOTE>, and even to have &s;uppo&s;ed,

that they had a particular place of exi&s;tence, beyond the &s;phere of
the vi&s;ible corporeal world; though this has been much controverted,
<PB N="121" REF="210">
both by the later Platoni&s;ts, and by &s;ome very judicious modern
critics, who have followed the interpretation of the later Platoni&s;ts,
<PB N="122" REF="211">
as what did mo&s;t honour to the judgment of that renowned philo&s;o|pher.
All the objects in this world, continued he, are particular
and individual. Here, therefore, the human mind has no oppor|tunity
of &s;eeing any Species, or Univer&s;al Nature. Whatever ideas
it has, therefore, of &s;uch beings, for it plainly has them, it mu&s;t
derive from the memory of what it has &s;een, in &s;ome former period
of its exi&s;tence, when it had an opportunity of vi&s;iting the place or
Sphere of Univer&s;als. For &s;ome time after it is immer&s;ed in the
body, during its infancy, its childhood, and a great part of its
youth, the violence of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which it derives from the
body, and which are all directed to the particular and individual ob|jects
of this world, hinder it from turning its attention to tho&s;e
Univer&s;al Natures, with which it had been conver&s;ant in the world
from whence it came. The Ideas, of the&s;e, therefore, &s;eem, in
this fir&s;t period of its exi&s;tence here, to be overwhelmed in the con|fu&s;ion
of tho&s;e turbulent emotions, and to be almo&s;t entirely wiped
out of its remembrance. During the continuance of this &s;tate, it is
incapable of Rea&s;oning, Science and Philo&s;ophy, which are con|ver&s;ant
about Univer&s;als. Its whole attention is turned towards par|ticular
objects, concerning which, being directed by no general no|tions,
it forms many vain and fal&s;e opinions, and is filled with
error, perplexity, and confu&s;ion. But, when age has abated the vio|lence
of its pa&s;&s;ions, and compo&s;ed the confu&s;ion of its thoughts, it
then becomes more capable of reflection, and of turning its atten|tion
to tho&s;e almo&s;t forgotten ideas of things with which it had been
conver&s;ant in the former &s;tate of its exi&s;tence. All the particular ob|jects
in this &s;en&s;ible world, being formed after the eternal exem|plars
in that intellectual world, awaken, upon account of their re|&s;emblance,
in&s;en&s;ibly, and by &s;low degrees, the almo&s;t obliterated
ideas of the&s;e la&s;t. The beauty, which is &s;hared in different degrees
among terre&s;trial objects, revives the &s;ame idea of that Univer&s;al
Nature of beauty which exi&s;ts in the intellectual world: particular acts
<PB N="123" REF="212">
of ju&s;tice, of the univer&s;al nature of ju&s;tice; particular rea&s;onings,
and particular &s;ciences, of the univer&s;al nature of &s;cience, and rea|&s;oning;
particular roundne&s;&s;es, of the univer&s;al nature of roundne&s;s;
particular &s;quares, of the univer&s;al nature of &s;quarene&s;s. Thus &s;ci|ence,
which is conver&s;ant about Univer&s;als, is derived from memory;
and to in&s;truct any per&s;on concerning the general nature of any
&s;ubject, is no more than to awaken in him the remembrance
of what he formerly knew about it. This both Plato and Socrates
imagined they could &s;till further confirm, by the fallacious experi|ment,
which &s;hewed, that a per&s;on might be led to di&s;cover him&s;elf,
without any information, any general truth, of which he was before
ignorant, merely by being a&s;ked a number of properly arranged and
connected que&s;tions concerning it.</P>
<P>The more the &s;oul was accu&s;tomed to the con&s;ideration of tho&s;e
Univer&s;al Natures, the le&s;s it was attached to any particular and indi|vidual
objects; it approached the nearer to the original perfection of its
nature, from which, according to this philo&s;ophy, it had fallen. Philo|&s;ophy,
which accu&s;toms it to con&s;ider the general E&s;&s;ence of things only,
and to ab&s;tract from all their particular and &s;en&s;ible circum&s;tances, was,
upon this account, regarded as the great puri&s;ier of the &s;oul. As death
&s;eparated the &s;oul from the body, and from the bodily &s;en&s;es and pa&s;|&s;ions,
it re&s;tored it to that intellectual world, from whence it had
originally de&s;cended, where no &s;en&s;ible Species called off its attention
from tho&s;e general E&s;&s;ences of things. Philo&s;ophy, in this life,
habituating it to the &s;ame con&s;iderations, brings it, in &s;ome degree,
to that &s;tate of happine&s;s and perfection, to which death re&s;tores the
&s;ouls of ju&s;t men in a life to come.</P>
<P>Such was the doctrine of Plato concerning the Species or Specific
E&s;&s;ence of things. This, at lea&s;t, is what his words &s;eem to import,
and thus he is under&s;tood by Ari&s;totle, the mo&s;t intelligent and the
<PB N="124" REF="213">
mo&s;t renowned of all his di&s;ciples. It is a doctrine, which, like
many of the other doctrines of ab&s;tract Philo&s;ophy, is more co|herent
in the expre&s;&s;ion than in the idea; and which &s;eems to have
ari&s;en, more from the nature of language, than from the nature of
things. With all its imperfections it was excu&s;able, in the begin|nings
of philo&s;ophy, and is not a great deal more remote from the
truth, than many others which have &s;ince been &s;ub&s;tituted in its
room by &s;ome of the greate&s;t pretenders to accuracy and preci&s;ion.
Mankind have had, at all times, a &s;trong propen&s;ity to realize their
own ab&s;tractions, of which we &s;hall immediately &s;ee an example, in
the notions of that very philo&s;opher who fir&s;t expo&s;ed the ill|grounded
foundation of tho&s;e Ideas, or Univer&s;als, of Plato and
Timaeus. To explain the nature, and to account for the origin of
general Ideas, is, even at this day, the greate&s;t difficulty in ab&s;tract
philo&s;ophy. How the human mind, when it rea&s;ons concerning the
general nature of triangles, &s;hould either conceive, as Mr. Locke
imagines it does, the idea of a triangle, which is neither obtu&s;an|gular,
nor rectangular, nor acutangular; but which was at once
both none and all of tho&s;e together; or &s;hould, as Malbranche thinks
nece&s;&s;ary for this purpo&s;e, comprehend at once, within its &s;inite
capacity, all po&s;&s;ible triangles of all po&s;&s;ible forms and dimen&s;ions,
which are infinite in number, is a que&s;tion, to which it is &s;urely not
ea&s;y to give a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer. Malbranche, to &s;olve it, had re|cour&s;e
to the enthu&s;ia&s;tic and unintelligible notion of the intimate
union of the human mind with the divine, in who&s;e infinite e&s;&s;ence
the immen&s;ity of &s;uch &s;pecies could alone be comprehended; and in
which alone, therefore, all finite intelligences could have an oppor|tunity
of viewing them. If, after more than two thou&s;and years
rea&s;oning about this &s;ubject, this ingenious and &s;ublime philo&s;opher
was forced to have recour&s;e to &s;o &s;trange a fancy, in order to ex|plain
it, can we wonder that Plato, in the very fir&s;t dawnings of
&s;cience, &s;hould, for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, adopt an hypothe&s;is, which
<PB N="125" REF="214">
has been thought, without much rea&s;on, indeed, to have &s;ome affi|nity
to that of Malbranche, and which is not more out of the
way?</P>
<P>What &s;eems to have mi&s;&s;ed tho&s;e early philo&s;ophers, was, the
notion, which appears, at fir&s;t, natural enough, that tho&s;e things,
cut of which any object is compo&s;ed, mu&s;t exi&s;t antecedent to that
object. But the things out of which all particular objects &s;eem to
be compo&s;ed, are the &s;tuff or matter of tho&s;e objects, and the form
or &s;pecific E&s;&s;ence, which determines them to be of this or that cla&s;s
of things. The&s;e, therefore, it was thought, mu&s;t have exi&s;ted an|tecedent
to the object which was made up between them. Plato,
who held, that the &s;en&s;ible world, which, according to him, is the
world of individuals, was made in time, nece&s;&s;arily conceived, that
both the univer&s;al matter, the object of a &s;purious rea&s;on, and the
&s;pecific e&s;&s;ence, the object of proper rea&s;on and philo&s;ophy out of
which it was compo&s;ed, mu&s;t have had a &s;eparate exi&s;tence from all
eternity. This intellectual world, very different from the intellec|tual
world of Cudworth, though much of the language of the one
has been borrowed from that of the other, was nece&s;&s;arily, and al|ways
exi&s;tent; whereas the &s;en&s;ible world owed its origin to the free
will and bounty of its author.</P>
<P>A notion of this kind, as long as it is expre&s;&s;ed in very general
language; as long as it is not much re&s;ted upon; nor attempted to
be very particularly and di&s;tinctly explained, pa&s;&s;es ea&s;ily enough,
through the indolent imagination, accu&s;tomed to &s;ub&s;titute words
in the room of ideas; and if the words &s;eem to hang ea&s;ily together,
requiring no great preci&s;ion in the ideas. It vani&s;hes, indeed; is
di&s;covered to be altogether incomprehen&s;ible, and eludes the gra&s;p
of the imagination, upon an attentive con&s;ideration. It requires,
however, an attentive con&s;ideration; and if it had been as fortunate
<PB N="126" REF="215">
as many other opinions of the &s;ame kind, and about the &s;ame &s;ub|ject,
it might, without examination, have continued to be the cur|rent
philo&s;ophy for a century or two. Ari&s;totle, however, &s;eems
immediately to have di&s;covered, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to conceive,
as actually exi&s;tent, either that general matter, which was not de|termined
by any particular &s;pecies, or tho&s;e &s;pecies which were not
embodied, if one may &s;ay &s;o, in &s;ome particular portion of matter.
Ari&s;totle, too, held, as we have already ob&s;erved, the eternity of
the &s;en&s;ible world. Though he held, therefore, that all &s;en&s;ible ob|jects
were made up of two principles, both of which, he calls,
equally, &s;ub&s;tances, the matter and the &s;pecific e&s;&s;ence, he was not
obliged to hold, like Plato, that tho&s;e principles exi&s;ted prior in the
order of time to the objects which they afterwards compo&s;ed. They
were prior, he &s;aid, in nature, but not in time, according to a di&s;|tinction
which was of u&s;e to him upon &s;ome other occa&s;ions. He
di&s;tingui&s;hed, too, betwixt actual and potential exi&s;tence. By the
fir&s;t, he &s;eems to have under&s;tood, what is commonly meant, by ex|i&s;tence
or reality; by the &s;econd, the bare po&s;&s;ibility of exi&s;tence.
His meaning, I &s;ay, &s;eems to amount to this; though he does not
explain it preci&s;ely in this manner. Neither the material E&s;&s;ence of
body could, according to him, exi&s;t actually without being deter|mined
by &s;ome &s;pecific E&s;&s;ence, to &s;ome particular cla&s;s of things,
nor any &s;pecific E&s;&s;ence without being embodied in &s;ome particular
portion of matter. Each of the&s;e two principles, however, could
exi&s;t potentially in this &s;eparate &s;tate. That matter exi&s;ted poten|tially,
which, being endowed with a particular form, could be
brought into actual exi&s;tence; and that form, which, by being em|bodied
in a particular portion of matter, could, in the &s;ame man|ner,
be called forth into the cla&s;s of complete realities. This poten|tial
exi&s;tence of matter and form, he &s;ometimes talks of, in expre&s;|&s;ions
which very much re&s;emble tho&s;e of Plato, to who&s;e notion of
&s;eparate E&s;&s;ence it bears a very great a&s;&s;inity.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="216">
Ari&s;totle, who &s;eems in many things original, and who endea|voured
to &s;eem to be &s;o in all things, added the principle of priva|tion
to tho&s;e of matter and form, which he had derived from the
ancient Pythagorean &s;chool. When Water is changed into Air, the
tran&s;mutation is brought about by the material principle of tho&s;e
two elements being deprived of the form of Water, and then a&s;&s;um|ing
the form of Air. Privation, therefore, was a third principle op|po&s;ite
to form, which entered into the generation of every Species,
which was always from &s;ome other Species. It was a principle of
generation, but not of compo&s;ition, as is obvious.</P>
<P>The Stoics, who&s;e opinions were, in all the different parts of phi|lo&s;ophy,
either the &s;ame with, or very nearly allied to tho&s;e of Ari&s;|totle
and Plato, though often di&s;gui&s;ed in very different language,
held, that all things, even the elements them&s;elves, were compound|ed
of two principles, upon one of which depended all the active;
and upon the other, all the pa&s;&s;ive powers of the&s;e bodies. The
la&s;t of the&s;e, they called the Matter; the fir&s;t, the Cau&s;e, by which
they meant the very &s;ame thing which Ari&s;totle and Plato under|&s;tood,
by their &s;pecific E&s;&s;ences. Matter, according to the Stoics,
could have no exi&s;tence &s;eparate from the cau&s;e or e&s;&s;icient principle
which determined it to &s;ome particular cla&s;s of things. Neither
could the efficient principle exi&s;t &s;eparately from the material, in
which it was always nece&s;&s;arily embodied. Their opinion, there|fore,
&s;o far coincided with that of the old Peripatetics. The effici|ent
principle, they &s;aid, was the Deity. By which they meant,
that it was a detached portion of the etherial and divine nature,
which penetrated all things, that con&s;tituted what Plato would have
called the &s;pecific E&s;&s;ence of each individual object; and &s;o far their
opinion coincides pretty nearly with that of the latter Platoni&s;ts,
who held, that the &s;pecific E&s;&s;ences of all things were detached por|tions
of their created deity, the &s;oul of the world; and with that of
<PB N="128" REF="217">
&s;ome of the Arabian and Schola&s;tic Commentators of Ari&s;tctle, who
held, that the &s;ub&s;tantial forms of all things de&s;cended from tho&s;e
Divine E&s;&s;ences which animated the Cele&s;tial Spheres. Such was
the doctrine of the four principal Sects of the ancient Philo&s;ophers,
concerning the &s;pecific E&s;&s;ences of things, of the old Pythagoreans, of
the Academical, Peripatetic, and Stoical Sects.</P>
<P>As this doctrine of &s;pecific E&s;&s;ences &s;eems naturally enough to
have ari&s;en from that ancient &s;y&s;tem of Phy&s;ics, which I have above
de&s;cribed, and which is, by no means, devoid of probability, &s;o many
of the doctrines of that &s;y&s;tem, which &s;eem to us, who have been
long accu&s;tomed to another, the mo&s;t incomprehen&s;ible, nece&s;&s;arily
flow from this metaphy&s;ical notion. Such are tho&s;e of generation,
corruption, and alteration; of mixture, conden&s;ation, and rarefaction.
A body was generated or corrupted, when it changed its &s;pecific E&s;|&s;ence,
and pa&s;&s;ed from one denomination to another. It was altered
when it changed only &s;ome of its qualities, but &s;till retained the
&s;ame &s;pecific E&s;&s;ence, and the &s;ame denomination. Thus, when a
flower was withered, it was not corrupted; though &s;ome of its qua|lities
were changed, it &s;till retained the &s;pecific E&s;&s;ence, and therefore
ju&s;tly pa&s;&s;ed under the denomination of a flower. But, when, in
the further progre&s;s of its decay, it crumbled into earth, it was cor|rupted;
it lo&s;t the &s;pecific E&s;&s;ence, or &s;ub&s;tantial form of the flower,
and a&s;&s;umed that of the earth, and therefore ju&s;tly changed its de|nomination.</P>
<P>The &s;pecific E&s;&s;ence, or univer&s;al nature that was lodged in each
particular cla&s;s of bodies, was not it&s;elf the object of any of our
&s;en&s;es, but could be perceived only by the under&s;tanding. It was
by the &s;en&s;ible qualities, however, that we judged of the &s;pecific E&s;|&s;ence
of each object. Some of the&s;e &s;en&s;ible qualities, therefore,
we regarded as e&s;&s;ential, or &s;uch as &s;howed, by their pre&s;ence or ab|&s;ence,
<PB N="129" REF="218">
the pre&s;ence or ab&s;ence of that e&s;&s;ential form from which
they nece&s;&s;arily flowed: Others were accidental, or &s;uch who&s;e
pre&s;ence or ab&s;ence had no &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences. The fir&s;t
of the&s;e two &s;orts of qualities was called Properties; the &s;econd, Ac|cidents.</P>
<P>In
the Specific E&s;&s;ence of each object it&s;elf, they di&s;tingui&s;hed two
parts; one of which was peculiar and characteri&s;tical of the cla&s;s of
things of which that particular object was an individual, the other
was common to it with &s;ome other higher cla&s;&s;es of things. The&s;e
two parts were, to the Specific E&s;&s;ence, pretty much what the Mat|ter
and the Specific E&s;&s;ence were to each individual body. The one,
which was called the Genus, was modified and determined by the
other, which was called the Specific Difference, pretty much in the
&s;ame manner as the univer&s;al matter contained in each body was
modified and determined by the Specific E&s;&s;ence of that particular
cla&s;&s; of bodies. The&s;e four, with the Specific E&s;&s;ence or Species it|&s;elf,
made up the number of the Five Univer&s;als, &s;o well known in
the &s;chools by the names of Genus, Species, Differentia, Proprium,
and Accidens.</P>

<P>THE mosl perfect imitation of an object of any kind, mu&s;t in

would even be con&s;idered as &s;ome diminution of that merit; a greater

the mo&s;t unpardonable blemi&s;h. To build another St. Peter's, or St.

<P>The exact re&s;emblance of the corre&s;pondent parts of the &s;ame ob|ject
is frequently con&s;idered as a beauty, and the want of it as a
deformity; as in the corre&s;pondent members of the human body,
in the oppo&s;ite wings of the &s;ame building, in the oppo&s;ite trees of
the &s;ame alley, in the corre&s;pondent compartments of the &s;ame piece
of carpet-work, or of the &s;ame flower-garden, in the chairs or tables
which &s;tand in the corre&s;pondent parts of the &s;ame room, &amp;c. But
in objects of the &s;ame kind, which in other re&s;pects are regarded as
altogether &s;eparate and unconnected, this exact re&s;emblance is &s;eldom
con&s;idered as a beauty, nor the want of it as a deformity. A man,
and in the &s;ame manner a hor&s;e, is hand&s;ome or ugly, each of them,
on account of his own intrin&s;ic beauty or deformity, without any
regard to their re&s;embling or not re&s;embling, the one, another man,
or the other, another hor&s;e. A &s;et of coach-hor&s;es, indeed, is &s;up|po&s;ed
to be hand&s;omer when they are all exactly matched; but
each hor&s;e is, in this ca&s;e, con&s;idered not as a &s;eparated and uncon|nected
object, or as a whole by him&s;elf, but as a part of another
whole, to the other parts of which he ought to bear a certain corre|&s;pondence:
Separated from the &s;et, he derives neither beauty from
his re&s;emblance, nor deformity from his unlikene&s;s to the other
hor&s;es which compo&s;e it.</P>
<P>Even in the corre&s;pondent parts of the &s;ame object, we frequently
require no more than a re&s;emblance in the general outline. If the
inferior members of tho&s;e corre&s;pondent parts are too minute to be
<PB N="135" REF="222">
&s;een di&s;tinctly, without a &s;eparate and di$tinct examination of each
part by it&s;elf, as a &s;eparate and unconnected object, we &s;hould &s;ome|times
even be di&s;plea&s;ed if the re&s;emblance was carried beyond this
general outline. In the corre&s;pondent parts of a room we frequently
hang pictures of the &s;ame &s;ize; tho&s;e pictures, however, re&s;emble
one another in nothing but the frame, or, perhaps, in the general
character of the &s;ubject: If the one is a land&s;cape, the other is a
land&s;cape too; if the one repre&s;ents a religious or a Bacchanalian
&s;ubject, its companion repre&s;ents another of the &s;ame kind. No|body
ever thought of repeating the &s;ame picture in each corre|&s;pondent
frame. The frame, and the general character of two or
three pictures, is as much as the eye can comprehend at one view,
or from one &s;tation. Each picture, in order to be &s;een di&s;tinctly,
and under&s;tood thoroughly, mu&s;t be viewed from a particular &s;tation,
and examined by it&s;elf as a &s;eparate and unconnected object. In a
hall or portico, adorned with &s;tatues, the nitches, or perhaps the
pede&s;tals, may exactly re&s;emble one another, but the &s;tatues are al|ways
different. Even the ma&s;ks which are &s;ometimes carried upon
the different key-&s;tones of the &s;ame arcade, or of the corre&s;pondent
doors and windows of the &s;ame front, though they may all re&s;emble
one another in the general outline, yet each of them has always its
own peculiar features, and a grimace of its own. There are &s;ome
Gothic buildings in which the corre&s;pondent windows re&s;emble one
another only in the general outline, and not in the &s;maller ornaments
and &s;ubdivi&s;ions. The&s;e are different in each, and the architect had
con&s;idered them as too minute to be &s;een di&s;tinctly, without a par|ticular
and &s;eparate examination of each window by it&s;elf, as a &s;e|parate
and unconnected object. A variety of this &s;ort, however, I
think, is not agreeable. In objects which are &s;u&s;ceptible only of a
certain inferior order of beauty, &s;uch as the frames of pictures, the
nitches or the pede&s;tals of &s;tatues, &amp;c. there &s;eems frequently to
<PB N="136" REF="223">
be affectation in the &s;tudy of variety, of which the merit is &s;carcely
ever &s;ufficient to compen&s;ate the want of that per&s;picuity and
di&s;tinctne&s;s, of that ea&s;ine&s;s to be comprehended and remembered,
which is the natural effect of exact uniformity. In a portico of the
Corinthian or Ionic order, each column re&s;embles every other, not
only in the general outline, but in all the minute&s;t ornaments;
though &s;ome of them, in order to be &s;een di&s;tinctly, may require a
&s;eparate and dictinct examination in each column, and in the enta|blature
of each intercolumnation. In the inlaid tables, which, ac|cording
to the pre&s;ent fa&s;hion, are &s;ometimes fixed in the corre|&s;pondent
parts of the &s;ame room, the pictures only are different in
each. All the other more frivolous and fanciful ornaments are
commonly, &s;o far at lea&s;t as I have ob&s;erved the fa&s;hion, the &s;ame
in them all. Tho&s;e ornaments, however, in order to be &s;een di&s;|tinctly,
require a &s;eparate and di&s;tinct examination of each table.</P>
<P>The extraordinary re&s;emblance of two natural objects, of twins,
for example, is regarded as a curious circum&s;tance; which, though it
does not increa&s;e, yet does not dimini&s;h the beauty of either, con|&s;idered
as a &s;eparate and unconnected object. But the exact re|&s;emblance
of two productions of art, &s;eems to be always con&s;idered
as &s;ome diminution of the merit of at lea&s;t one of them; as it &s;eems
to prove, that one of them, at lea&s;t, is a copy either of the other,
or of &s;ome other original. One may &s;ay, even of the copy of a
picture, that it derives its merit, not &s;o much from its re&s;emblance
to the original, as from its re&s;emblance to the object which the ori|ginal
was meant to re&s;emable. The owner of the copy, &s;o far from
&s;etting any high value upon its re&s;emblance to the original, is often
anxious to de&s;troy any value or merit which it might derive from
this circum&s;tance. He is often anxious to per&s;uade both him|&s;elf
and other people that it is not a copy, but an original, of
<PB N="137" REF="224">
which what pa&s;&s;es for the original is only a copy. But, whatever
merit a copy may derive from its re&s;emblance to the original,
an original can certainly derive none from the re&s;emblance of its
copy.</P>
<P>But though a production of art &s;eldom derives any merit from its
re&s;emblance to another object of the &s;ame kind, it frequently derives
a great deal from its re&s;emblance to an object of a different kind,
whether that object be a production of art or of nature. A painted
cloth, the work of &s;ome laborious Dutch arti&s;t, &s;o curiou&s;ly &s;haded
and coloured as to repre&s;ent the pile and &s;oftne&s;s of a woollen one,
might derive &s;ome merit from its re&s;emblance even to the &s;orry car|pet
which now lies before me. The copy might, and probably
would, in this ca&s;e, be of much greater value than the original.
But if this carpet was repre&s;ented as &s;pread, either upon a floor or
upon a table, and projecting from the back ground of the picture,
with exact ob&s;ervation of per&s;pective, and of light and &s;hade, the
merit of the imitation would be &s;till greater.</P>
<P>In Painting, a plain &s;urface of one kind is made to re&s;emble, not
only a plain &s;urface of another, but all the three dimen&s;ions of a
&s;olid &s;ub&s;tance. In Statuary and Sculpture, a &s;olid &s;ub&s;tance of one
kind, is made to re&s;emble a &s;olid &s;ub&s;tance of another. The di&s;pa|rity
between the object imitating, and the object imitated, is much
greater in the one art than in the other; and the plea&s;ure ari&s;ing
from the imitation &s;eems to be greater in proportion as this di&s;parity
is greater.</P>
<P>In Painting, the imitation frequently plea&s;es, though the original
object be indifferent, or even offen&s;ive. In Statuary and Sculpture it
is otherwi&s;e. The imitation &s;eldom plea&s;es, unle&s;s the original ob|ject
<PB N="138" REF="225">
be in a very high degree either great, or beautiful, or intere&s;ting.
A butcher's &s;tall, or a kitchen-dre&s;&s;er, with the objects which they
commonly pre&s;ent, are not certainly the happie&s;t &s;ubjects, even for
Painting. They have, however, been repre&s;ented with &s;o much
care and &s;ucce&s;s by &s;ome Dutch ma&s;ters, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to view
the pictures without &s;ome degree of plea&s;ure. They would be mo&s;t
ab&s;urd &s;ubjects for Statuary or Sculpture, which are, however, ca|pable
of repre&s;enting them. The picture of a very ugly or deformed
man, &s;uch as Ae&s;op, or Scarron, might not make a di&s;agreeable
piece of furniture. The &s;tatue certainly would. Even a vulgar or|dinary
man or woman, engaged in a vulgar ordinary action, like
what we &s;ee with &s;o much plea&s;ure in the pictures of Rembrant,
would be too mean a &s;ubject for Statuary. Jupiter, Hercules, and
Apollo, Venus and Diana, the Nymphs and the Graces, Bacchus,
Mercury, Antinous and Meleager, the mi&s;erable death of Laocoon,
the melancholy fate of the children of Niobe, the Wre&s;tlers, the
fighting, the dying gladiator, the figures of gods and godde&s;&s;es, of
heroes and heroines, the mo&s;t perfect forms of the human body,
placed either in the noble&s;t attitudes, or in the mo&s;t intere&s;ting &s;itu|ations
which the human imagination is capable of conceiving, are
the proper, and therefore have always been the favourite &s;ubjects of
Statuary: that art cannot, without degrading it&s;elf, &s;toop to repre|&s;ent
any thing that is offen&s;ive, or mean, or even indifferent.
Painting is not &s;o di&s;dainful; and, though capable of repre&s;enting the
noble&s;t objects, it ecan, without for&s;eiting its title to plea&s;e, &s;ubmit
to imitate tho&s;e of a much more humble nature. The merit of the
imitation alone, and without any merit in the imitated object, is
eapable of &s;upporting the dignity of Painting: it cannot &s;upport
that of Statuary. There would &s;eem, therefore, to be more merit
in the one &s;pecies of imitation than in the other.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="226">
In Statuary, &s;carcely any drapery is agreeable. The be&s;t of the an|cient
&s;tatues were either altogether naked; or almo&s;t naked and tho&s;e
of which any con&s;iderable part of the body is covered, are repre|&s;ented
as clothed in wet linen&mdash;a &s;pecies of clothing which mo&s;t
certainly never was agreeable to the fa&s;hion of any country. This
drapery too is drawn &s;o tight, as to expre&s;s beneath its narrow fold|ings
the exact form and outline of any limb, and almo&s;t of every
mu&s;cle of the body. The clothing which thus approached the
neare&s;t to no clothing at all, had, it &s;eems, in the judgment of the
great arti&s;ts of antiquity, been that which was mo&s;t &s;uitable to Sta|tuary.
A great painter of the Roman &s;chool, who had formed his
manner almo&s;t entirely upon the &s;ludy of the ancient &s;tatues, imi|tated
at fir&s;t their drapery in his pictures; but he &s;oon found that in
Painting it had the air of meanne&s;s and poverty, as if the per&s;ons
who wore it could &s;carce afford clothes enough to cover them; and
that larger folds, and a loo&s;er and more &s;lowing drapery, were more
&s;uitable to the nature of his art. In Painting, the imitation of &s;o
very inferior an object as a &s;uit of clothes is capable of plea&s;ing;
and, in order to give this object all the magnificence of which it is
capable, it is nece&s;&s;ary that the folds &s;hould be large, loo&s;e,
and flowing. It is not nece&s;&s;ary in Painting that the exact
form and outline of every limb, and almo&s;t of every mu&s;cle of
the body, &s;hould be expre&s;&s;ed beneath the folds of the drapery;
it is &s;ufficient if the&s;e are &s;o di&s;po&s;ed as to indicate in general the
&s;ituation and attitude of the principal limbs. Painting, by the mere
force and merit of its imitation, can venture, without the hazard of
di&s;plea&s;ing, to &s;ub&s;titute, upon many occa&s;ions, the inferior in the
room of the &s;uperior object, by making the one, in this manner,
cover and entirely conceal a great part of the other. Statuary can
&s;eldom venture to do this, but with the utmo&s;t re&s;erve and caution;
and the &s;ame drapery, which is noble and magnificent in the one
<PB N="140" REF="227">
art, appears clum&s;y and awkward in the other. Some modern arti&s;ts,
however, have attempted to introduce into Statuary the drapery
which is peculiar to Painting. It may not, perhaps, upon every oc|ca&s;ion,
be quite &s;o ridiculous as the marble periwigs in We&s;tmin&s;ter
Abbey: but, if it does not always appear clum&s;y and awkward, it is
at be&s;t always in&s;ipid and unintere&s;ting.</P>
<P>It is not the want of colouring which hinders many things from
plea&s;ing in Statuary, which plea&s;e in Painting; it is the want of
that degree of di&s;parity between the imitating and the imitated ob|ject,
which, is nece&s;&s;ary, in order to render intere&s;ting the imita|tion,
of an object which is it&s;elf not intere&s;ting. Colouring, when
added to Statuary, &s;o far from increa&s;ing, de&s;troys almo&s;t en|tirely
the plea&s;ure which we receive from the imitation; becau&s;e
it takes away the great &s;ource of that plea&s;ure, the di&s;parity be|tween
the imitating and the imitated object. That one &s;olid and
coloured object &s;hould exactly re&s;emble another &s;olid and coloured
object, &s;eems to be a matter of no great wonder or admiration. A
painted &s;tatue, though it certainly may re&s;emble a human figure
much more exactly than any &s;tatue which is not painted, is gene|rally
acknowledged to be a di&s;agreeable, and even an offen&s;ive ob|ject;
and &s;o far are we from being plea&s;ed with this &s;uperior like|ne&s;s,
that we are never &s;atisfied with it; and, after viewing it again
and again, we always find that it is not equal to what we are di&s;|po&s;ed
to imagine it might have been: though it &s;hould &s;eem to
want &s;carce any thing but the life, we could not pardon it for thus
wanting what it is altogether impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould have. The works
of Mrs. Wright, a &s;elf-taught arti&s;t of great merit, are perhaps more
perfect in this way than any thing I have ever &s;een. They do ad|mirably
well to be &s;een now and then as a &s;how; but the be&s;t of
them we &s;hould find, if brought home to our own hou&s;e, and placed
in a &s;ituation where it was to come often into view, would make,
<PB N="141" REF="228">
in&s;tead of an ornamental, a mo&s;t offen&s;ive piece of hou&s;ehold fur|niture.
Painted &s;tatues, accordingly, are univer&s;ally reprobated, and
we &s;carce ever meet with them. To colour the eyes of &s;tatues is not
altogether &s;o uncommon: even this, however, is di&s;approved by all
good judges. &startq;I cannot bear it,&endq; (a gentleman u&s;ed to &s;ay, of great
knowledge and judgment in this art,) &startq;I cannot bear it; I always
&startq;want them to &s;peak to me.&endq;</P>
<P>Artificial fruits and flowers &s;ometimes imitate &s;o exactly the na|tural
objects which they repre&s;ent, that they frequently deceive us.
We &s;oon grow weary of them, however; and, though they &s;eem to
want nothing but the fre&s;hne&s;s and the flavour of natural fruits and
flowers, we cannot pardon them, in the &s;ame manner, for thus
wanting what it is altogether impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould have. But we
do not grow weary of a good flower and fruit painting. We do
not grow weary of the foliage of the Corinthian capital, or of the
flowers which &s;ometimes ornament the frize of that order. Such
imitations, however, never deceive us; their re&s;emblance to the ori|ginal
objects is always much inferior to that of artificial fruits and
flowers. Such as it is, however, we are contented with it; and,
where there is &s;uch di&s;parity between the imitating and the imitated
objects, we find that it is as great as it can be, or as we expect that
it &s;hould be. Paint that foliage and tho&s;e flowers with the natural
colours, and, in&s;tead of plea&s;ing more, they will plea&s;e much le&s;s.
The re&s;emblance, however, will be much greater; but the di&s;parity
between the imitating and the imitated objects will be &s;o much le&s;s,
that even this &s;uperior re&s;emblance will not &s;atisfy us. Where the
di&s;parity is very great, on the contrary, we are often contented with
the mo&s;t imperfect re&s;emblance; with the very imperfect re|&s;emblance,
for example, both as to figure and colour, of fruits and
flowers in &s;hell-work.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="229">
It may be ob&s;erved, however, that, though in Sculpture the imi|tation
of flowers and foliage plea&s;es as an ornament of architecture,
as a part of the dre&s;s which is to &s;et off the beauty of a different
and a more important object, it would not plea&s;e alone, or as a &s;e|parate
and unconnected object, in the &s;ame manner as a fruit and
flower painting plea&s;es. Flowers and foliage, how elegant and beau|tiful
&s;oever, are not &s;ufficiently intere&s;ting; they have not dignity
enough, if I may &s;ay &s;o, to be proper &s;ubjects for a piece of Sculp|ture,
which is to plea&s;e alone, and not as the ornamental appendage
of &s;ome other object.</P>
<P>In Tape&s;try and Needle-work, in the &s;ame manner as in Painting,
a plain &s;urface is &s;ometimes made to repre&s;ent all the three dimen|&s;ions
of a &s;olid &s;ub&s;tance. But both the &s;huttle of the weaver, and
the needle of the embroiderer, are in&s;truments of imitation &s;o much
inferior to the pencil of the painter, that we are not &s;urpri&s;ed to find
a proportionable inferiority in their productions. We have all more
or le&s;s experience that they u&s;ually are much inferior; and, in ap|preciating
a piece of Tape&s;try or Needle-work, we never compare the
imitation of either with that of a good picture, for it never could
&s;tand that compari&s;on, but with that of other pieces of Tape&s;try or
Needle-work. We take into con&s;ideration, not only the di&s;parity
between the imitating and the imitated object, but the awkwardne&s;s of
the in&s;truments of imitation; and if it is as well as any thing that
can be expected from the&s;e, if it is better than the greater part of
what actually comes from them, we are often not only contented
but highly plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>A good painter will often execute in a few days a &s;ubject which
would employ the be&s;t tape&s;try-weaver for many years; though, in
proportion to his time, therefore, the latter is always much wor&s;e
<PB N="143" REF="230">
paid than the former, yet his work in the end comes commonly
much dearer to market. The great expence of good Tape&s;try, the
circum&s;tance which confines it to the palaces of princes and great
lords, gives it, in the eyes of the greater part of people, an air of
riches and magnificence, which contributes &s;till further to compen&s;ate
the imperfection of its imitation. In arts which addre&s;s them&s;elves,
not to the prudent and the wi&s;e, but to the rich and the great, to
the proud and the vain, we ought not to wonder if the appearance
of great expence, of being what few people can purcha&s;e, of being
one of the &s;ure&s;t characteri&s;tics of great fortune, &s;hould often &s;tand
in the place of exqui&s;ite beauty, and contribute equally to recom|mend
their productions. As the idea of expence &s;eems often to
embelli&s;h, &s;o that of cheapne&s;s &s;eems as frequently to tarni&s;h the
lu&s;tre even of very agreeable objects. The difference between real
and fal&s;e jewels is what even the experienced eye of a jeweller can
&s;ometimes with difficulty di&s;tingui&s;h. Let an unknown lady, how|ever,
come into a public a&s;&s;embly, with a head-dre&s;s which ap|pears
to be very richly adorned with diamonds, and let a jeweller
only whi&s;per in our ear that they are all fal&s;e &s;tones, not only the
lady will immediately &s;ink in our imagination from the rank of a
prince&s;s to that of a very ordinary woman, but the head-dre&s;s, from
an object of the mo&s;t &s;plendid magnificence, will at once become an
impertinent piece of tawdry and tin&s;el &s;inery.</P>
<P>It was &s;ome years ago the fa&s;hion to ornament a garden with yew
and holly trees, clipped into the artificial &s;hapes of pyramids, and
columns, and va&s;es, and obeli&s;ks. It is now the fa&s;hion to ridicule
this ta&s;te as unnatural. The figure of a pyramid or obeli&s;k, how|ever,
is not more unnatural to a yew-tree than to a block of por|phyry
or marble. When the yew-tree is pre&s;ented to the eye in this
artificial &s;hape, the gardener does not mean that it &s;hould be under|&s;tood
<PB N="144" REF="231">
to have grown in that &s;hape: he means, fir&s;t, to give it the
&s;ame beauty of regular figure, which plea&s;es &s;o much in porphyry
and marble; and, &s;econdly, to imitate in a growing tree the orna|ments
of tho&s;e precious materials: he means to make an object of
one kind re&s;emble another object of a very different kind; and to
the original beauty of figure to join the relative beauty of imitation:
but the di&s;parity between the imitating and the imitated object is the
foundation of the beauty of imitation. It is becau&s;e the one object
does not naturally re&s;emble the other, that we are &s;o much plea&s;ed
with it, when by art it is made to do &s;o. The &s;hears of the gar|dener,
it may be &s;aid, indeed, are very clum&s;y in&s;truments of Sculp|ture.
They are &s;o, no doubt, when employed to imitate the figures
of men, or even of animals. But in the &s;imple and regular forms
of pyramids, va&s;es, and obeli&s;ks, even the &s;hears of the gardener do
well enough. Some allowance too is naturally made for the nece&s;|&s;ary
imperfection of the in&s;trument, in the &s;ame manner as in Ta|pe&s;try
and Needle-work. In &s;hort, the next time you have an op|portunity
of &s;urveying tho&s;e out-of-fa&s;hion ornaments, endeavour
only to let your&s;elf alone, and to re&s;train for a few minutes the
fooli&s;h pa&s;&s;ion for playing the critic, and you will be &s;en&s;ible that
they are not without &s;ome degree of beauty; that they give the air
of neatne&s;s and correct culture at lea&s;t to the whole garden; and
that they are not unlike what the &startq;retired lei&s;ure, that&endq; (as Milton
&s;ays) &startq;in trim gardens takes his plea&s;ure,&endq; might be amu&s;ed with.
What then, it may be &s;aid, has brought them into &s;uch univer&s;al
di&s;repute among us? In a pyramid or obeli&s;k of marble, we know
that the materials are expen&s;ive, and that the labour which wrought
them into that &s;hape mu&s;t have been &s;till more &s;o. In a pyramid
or obeli&s;k of yew, we know that the materials could co&s;t very
little, and the labour &s;till le&s;s. The former are ennobled by their ex|pence;
the latter degraded by their cheapne&s;s. In the cabbage-garden
<PB N="145" REF="232">
of a tallow-chandler we may &s;ometimes perhaps have &s;een as many
columns and va&s;es, and other ornaments in yew, as there are in marble
and porphyry at Ver&s;ailles: it is this vulgarity which has di&s;graced
them. The rich and the great, the proud and the vain, will not admit
into their gardens an ornament which the meane&s;t of the people can
have as well as they. The ta&s;te for the&s;e ornaments came originally
from France; where, notwith&s;tanding that incon&s;tancy of fa&s;hion
with which we &s;ometimes reproach the natives of that country, it
&s;till continues in good repute. In France, the condition of the infe|rior
ranks of people is &s;eldom &s;o happy as it frequently is in Eng|land;
and you will there &s;eldom find even pyramids and obeli&s;ks of
yew in the garden of a tallow-chandler. Such ornaments, not hav|ing
in that country been degraded by their vulgarity, have not yet
been excluded from the gardens of princes and great lords.</P>
<P>The works of the great ma&s;ters in Statuary and Painting, it
is to be ob&s;erved, never produce their effect by deception. They
never are, and it never is intended that they &s;hould be mi&s;taken for
the real objects which they repre&s;ent. Painted Statuary may &s;ome|times
deceive an inattentive eye: proper Statuary never does. The
little pieces of per&s;pective in Painting, which it is intended &s;hould
plea&s;e by deception, repre&s;ent always &s;ome very &s;imple, as well as
in&s;ignificant, object; a roll of paper, for example, or the &s;teps of
a &s;tairca&s;e, in the dark corner of &s;ome pa&s;&s;age or gallery. They are
generally the works too of &s;ome very inferior arti&s;ts. After being &s;een
once, and producing the little &s;urpri&s;e which it is meant they &s;hould
excite, together with the mirth which commonly accompanies it,
they never plea&s;e more, but appear ever after in&s;ipid and tire|&s;ome.</P>
<P>The
proper plea&s;ure which we derive from tho&s;e two imitative
arts, &s;o far from being the effect of deception, is altogether incom|patible
<PB N="146" REF="233">
with it. That plea&s;ure is founded altogether upon our won|der
at &s;eeing an object of one kind repre&s;ent &s;o well an object of a
very different kind, and upon our admiration of the art which &s;ur|mounts
&s;o happily that di&s;parity which Nature had e&s;tabli&s;hed be|tween
them. The nobler works of Statuary and Painting appear to
us a &s;ort of wonderful phaenomena, differing in this re&s;pect from
the wonderful phaenomena of Nature, that they carry, as it were,
their own explication along with them, and demon&s;trate, even to
the eye, the way and manner in which they are produced. The
eye, even of an un&s;kilful &s;pectator, immediately di&s;cerns, in &s;ome
mea&s;ure, how it is that a certain modification of figure in Statuary,
and of brighter and darker colours in Painting, can repre&s;ent, with
&s;o much truth and vivacity, the actions, pa&s;&s;ions, and behaviour of
men, as well as a great variety of other objects. The plea&s;ing
wonder of ignorance is accompanied with the &s;till more plea&s;ing
&s;atisfaction of &s;cience. We wonder and are amazed at the effect;
and we are plea&s;ed our&s;elves, and happy to find that we can com|prehend,
in &s;ome mea&s;ure, how that wonderful effect is produced.</P>
<P>A good looking-gla&s;s repre&s;ents the objects which are &s;et before
it with much more truth and vivacity than either Statuary or Paint|ing.
But, though the &s;cience of optics may explain to the under|&s;tanding,
the looking-gla&s;s it&s;elf does not at all demon&s;trate to the
eye how this effect is brought about. It may excite the wonder of
ignorance; and in a clown, who had never beheld a looking-gla&s;s
before, I have &s;een that wonder ri&s;e almo&s;t to rapture and exta&s;y;
but it cannot give the &s;atisfaction of &s;cience. In all looking-gla&s;&s;es
the effects are produced by the &s;ame means, applied exactly in the
&s;ame manner. In every different &s;tatue and picture the effects are
produced; though by &s;imilar, yet not by the &s;ame means; and tho&s;e
means too are applied in a different manner in each. Every good
&s;tatue and picture is a fre&s;h wonder, which at the &s;ame time carries,
<PB N="147" REF="234">
in &s;ome mea&s;ure, its own explication along with it. After a little
u&s;e and experience, all looking-gla&s;&s;es cea&s;e to be wonders alto|gether;
and even the ignorant become &s;o familiar with them, as not
to think that their effects require any explication. A looking-gla&s;s,
be&s;ides, can repre&s;ent only pre&s;ent objects; and, when the wonder is
once fairly over, we choo&s;e, in all ca&s;es, rather to contemplate the
&s;ub&s;tance than to gaze at the &s;hadow. One's own face becomes then
the mo&s;t agreeable object which a looking-gla&s;s can repre&s;ent to us,
and the only object which we do not &s;oon grow weary with looking
at; it is the only pre&s;ent object of which we can &s;ee only the &s;ha|dow;
whether hand&s;ome or ugly, whether old or young, it is the
face of a friend always, of which the features corre&s;pond exactly
with whatever &s;entiment, emotion, or pa&s;&s;ion we may happen at that
moment to feel.</P>
<P>In Statuary, the means by which the wonderful effect is brought
about appear more &s;imple and obvious than in Painting; where the
di&s;parity between the imitating and the imitated object being much
greater, the art which can conquer that greater di&s;parity appears evi|dently,
and almo&s;t to the eye, to be founded upon a much deeper
&s;cience, or upon principles much more ab&s;tru&s;e and profound.
Even in the meane&s;t &s;ubjects we can often trace with plea&s;ure the
ingenious means by which Painting furmounts this di&s;parity. But
we cannot do this in Statuary, becau&s;e the di&s;parity not being &s;o
great, the means do not appear &s;o ingenious. And it is upon this
account, that in Painting we are often delighted with the repre&s;ent|ation
of many things, which in Statuary would appear in&s;ipid, tire|&s;ome,
and not worth the looking at.</P>
<P>It ought to be ob&s;erved, however, that though in Statuary the
are of imitation appears, in many re&s;pects, inferior to what it is in
<PB N="148" REF="235">
Painting, yet, in a room ornamented with both &s;tatues and pic|tures
of nearly equal merit, we &s;hall generally find that the &s;tatues
draw off our eye from the pictures. There is generally but one, or
little more than one, point of view from which a picture can be
&s;een with advantage, and it always pre&s;ents to the eye preci&s;ely the
&s;ame object. There are many different points of view from which
a &s;tatue may be &s;een with equal advantage, and from each it pre&s;ents
a different object. There is more variety in the plea&s;ure which we
receive from a good &s;tatue, than in that which we receive from a
good picture; and one &s;tatue may frequently be the &s;ubject of many
good pictures or drawings, all different from one another. The
&s;hadowy relief and projection, of a picture, be&s;ides, is much flattened,
and &s;eems almo&s;t to vani&s;h away altogether, when brought into
compari&s;on with the real and &s;olid body which &s;tands by it. How
nearly &s;oever the&s;e two arts may &s;eem to be a-kin, they accord &s;o
very ill with one another, that their different productions ought,
perhaps, &s;carce ever to be &s;een together.</P>

Mu&s;ic and Dancing. In the progre&s;s of art and improvement they
are, perhaps, the fir&s;t and earlie&s;t plea&s;ures of his own invention;
for tho&s;e which ari&s;e from the gratification of the bodily appetites
cannot be &s;aid to be of his own invention. No nation has yet been
di&s;covered &s;o uncivilized as to be altogether without them. It

&s;eems even to be among&s;t the mo&s;t barbarous nations that the u&s;e
and practice of them is both mo&s;t frequent and mo&s;t univer&s;al, as
among the negroes of Africa and the &s;avage tribes of America. In
civilized nations, the inferior ranks of people have very little lei&s;ure,
and the &s;uperior ranks have many other amu&s;ements; neither the
one nor the other, therefore, can &s;pend much of their time in Mu&s;ic
and Dancing. Among &s;avage nations, the great body of the people
have frequently great intervals of lei&s;ure, and they have &s;carce any
other amu&s;ement; they naturally, therefore, &s;pend a great part of
their time in almo&s;t the only one they have.</P>
<P>What the ancients called Rhythmus, what we call Time or Mea|&s;ure,
is the connecting principle of tho&s;e two arts; Mu&s;ic con&s;i&s;ting
in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of a certain &s;ort of &s;ounds, and Dancing in a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
of a certain &s;ort of &s;teps, ge&s;tures, and motions, regulated
according to time or mea&s;ure, and thereby formed into a &s;ort of$
whole or &s;y&s;tem; which in the one art is called a &s;ong or tune, and
in the other a dance; the time or mea&s;ure of the dance corre&s;pond|ing
always exactly with that of the &s;ong or tune which acco$|panies
and directs it<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The Author's Ob&s;ervations on the Af&s;inity between Mu&s;ic, Dancing, and Poetry, are annexed to the end of Part III. of this E&s;&s;ay.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The human voice, as it is always the be&s;t, &s;o it would naturally
be the fir&s;t and earlie&s;t of all mu&s;ical in&s;truments: in &s;inging, or in
its fir&s;t attempts towards &s;inging, it would naturally employ &s;ounds as
&s;imilar as po&s;&s;ible to tho&s;e which it had been accu&s;tomed to; that is,
it would employ words of &s;ome kind or other, pronouncing them only
in time and mea&s;ure, and generally with a more melodious tone than
had been u&s;ual in common conver&s;ation. Tho&s;e words, however,
might not, and probably would not, for a long time have any mean|ing,
but might re&s;emble the &s;yllables which we make u&s;e of in
<PB N="150" REF="237">
<HI>&s;ol-faing,</HI> or the <HI>derry-down-down</HI> of our common ballads; and
&s;erve only to a&s;&s;i&s;t the voice in forming &s;ounds proper to be modu|lated
into melody, and to be lengthened or &s;hortened according to
the time and mea&s;ure of the tune. This rude form of vocal Mu&s;ic,
as it is by far the mo&s;t &s;imple and obvious, &s;o it naturally would be
the fir&s;t and earlie&s;t.</P>
<P>In the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages it could not fail to occur, that in the
room of tho&s;e unmeaning or mu&s;ical words, if I may call them &s;o,
might be &s;ub&s;tituted words which expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;en&s;e or meaning,
and of which the pronunciation might coincide as exactly with the
time and mea&s;ure of the tune, as that of the mu&s;ical words had
done before. Hence the origin of Ver&s;e or Poetry. The Ver&s;e
would for a long time be rude and imperfect. When the meaning
words fell &s;hort of the mea&s;ure required, they would frequently be
eked out with the unmeaning ones, as is &s;ometimes done in our
common ballads. When the public ear came to be &s;o refined as to
reject, in all &s;erious Poetry, the unmeaning words altogether, there
would &s;till be a liberty a&s;&s;umed of altering and corrupting, upon
many occa&s;ions, the pronunciation of the meaning ones, for the &s;ake
of accommodating them to the mea&s;ure. The &s;yllables which com|po&s;ed
them would, for this purpo&s;e, &s;ometimes be improperly length|ened,
and &s;ometimes improperly &s;hortened; and though no un|meaning
words were made u&s;e of, yet an unmeaning &s;yllable would
&s;ometimes be &s;tuck to the beginning, to the end, or into the middle
of a word. All the&s;e expedients we find frequently employed in
the ver&s;es even of Chaucer, the father of the Engli&s;h Poetry. Many
ages might pa&s;s away before ver&s;e was commonly compo&s;ed with
&s;uch correctne&s;s, that the u&s;ual and proper pronunciation of the words
alone, and without any other artifice, &s;ubjected the voice to the ob|&s;ervation
of a time and mea&s;ure, of the &s;ame kind with the time
and mea&s;ure of Mu&s;ic.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="238">
The Ver&s;e would naturally expre&s;s &s;ome &s;en&s;e which &s;uited the
grave or gay, the joyous or melancholy humour of the tune which
it was &s;ung to; being as it were blended and united with that tune,
it would &s;eem to give &s;en&s;e and meaning to what otherwi&s;e might
not appear to have any, or at lea&s;t any which could be clearly and
di&s;tinctly under&s;tood, without the accompaniment of &s;uch an ex|plication.</P>
<P>A
pantomime dance may frequently an&s;wer the &s;ame purpo&s;e, and,
by repre&s;enting &s;ome adventure in love or war, may &s;eem to give
&s;en&s;e and meaning to a Mu&s;ic which might not otherwi&s;e appear to
have any. It is more natural to mimic, by ge&s;tures and motions, the
adventures of common life, than to expre&s;s them in Ver&s;e or Poetry.
The thought it&s;elf is more obvious, and the execution is much more
ea&s;y. If this mimicry was accompanied by mu&s;ic, it would of its
own accord, and almo&s;t without any intention of doing &s;o, accom|modate,
in &s;ome mea&s;ure, its different &s;teps and movements to the
time and mea&s;ure of the tune; e&s;pecially if the &s;ame per&s;on both
&s;ung the tune and performed the mimicry, as is &s;aid to be frequently
the ca&s;e among the &s;avage nations of Africa and America. Panto|mime
Dancing might in this manner &s;erve to give a di&s;tinct &s;en&s;e
and meaning to Mu&s;ic many ages before the invention, or at lea&s;t
before the common u&s;e of Poetry. We hear little, accordingly, of
the Poetry of the &s;avage nations of Africa and America, but a great
deal of their pantomime dances.</P>
<P>Poetry, however, is capable of expre&s;&s;ing many things fully and
di&s;tinctly, which Dancing either cannot repre&s;ent at all, or can re|pre&s;ent
but ob&s;curely and imperfectly; &s;uch as the rea&s;onings and
judgments of the under&s;tanding; the ideas, fancies, and &s;u&s;picions
of the imagination; the &s;entiments, emotions, and pa&s;&s;ions of the
<PB N="152" REF="239">
heart. In the power of expre&s;&s;ing a meaning with clearne&s;s and
di&s;tinctne&s;s, Dancing is &s;uperior to Mu&s;ic, and Poetry to Dancing.</P>
<P>Of tho&s;e three Si&s;ter Arts, which originally, perhaps, went always
together, and which at all times go frequently together, there are
two which can &s;ub&s;i&s;t alone, and &s;eparate &s;rom their natural com|panions,
and one which cannot. In the di&s;tinct ob&s;ervation of what
the ancients called Rhythmus, of what we call Time and Mea&s;ure,
con&s;i&s;ts the e&s;&s;ence both of Dancing and of Poetry or Ver&s;e; or the
characteri&s;tical quality which di&s;tingui&s;hes the former from all other
motion and action, and the latter from all other di&s;cour&s;e. But,
concerning the proportion between tho&s;e intervals and divi&s;ions of
duration which con&s;titute what is called time and mea&s;ure, the ear,
it would &s;eem, can judge with much more preci&s;ion than the eye;
and Poetry, in the &s;ame manner as Mu&s;ic, addre&s;&s;es it&s;elf to the
ear, whereas Dancing addre&s;&s;es it&s;elf to the eye. In Dancing, the
rhythmus, the proper proportion, the time and mea&s;ure of its mo|tions,
cannot di&s;tinctly be perceived, unle&s;s they are marked by the
more di&s;tinct time and mea&s;ure of Mu&s;ic. It is otherwi&s;e in Poetry;
no accompaniment is nece&s;&s;ary to mark the mea&s;ure of good Ver&s;e.
Mu&s;ic and Poetry, therefore, can each of them &s;ub&s;i&s;t alone; Dancing
always requires the accompaniment of Mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>It is In&s;trumental Mu&s;ic which can be&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;t apart, and &s;eparate
from both Poetry and Dancing. Vocal Mu&s;ic, though it may, and
frequently does, con&s;i&s;t of notes which have no di&s;tinct &s;en&s;e or
meaning, yet naturally calls for the &s;upport of Poetry. But
&startq;Mu&s;ic, married to immortal Ver&s;e,&endq; as Milton &s;ays, or even to
words of any kind which have a di&s;tinct &s;en&s;e or meaning, is ne|ce&s;&s;arily
and e&s;&s;entially imitative. Whatever be the meaning of tho&s;e
words, though, like many of the &s;ongs of ancient Greece, as well
<PB N="153" REF="240">
as &s;ome of tho&s;e of more modern times, they may expre&s;s merely
&s;ome maxims of prudence and morality, or may contain merely the
&s;imple narrative of &s;ome important event, yet even in &s;uch didactic
and hi&s;torical &s;ongs there will &s;till be imitation; there will &s;till be a
thing of one kind, which by art is made to re&s;emble a thing of a
very different kind; there will &s;till be Mu&s;ic imitating di&s;cour&s;e;
there will &s;till be rhythmus and melody, &s;haped and fa&s;hioned into
the form either of a good moral coun&s;el, or of an amu&s;ing and inte|re&s;ting
&s;tory.</P>
<P>In this fir&s;t &s;pecies of imitation, which being e&s;&s;ential to, is there|fore
in&s;eparable from, all &s;uch Vocal Mu&s;ic, there may, and there
commonly is, added a &s;econd. The words may, and commonly do,
expre&s;s the &s;ituation of &s;ome particular per&s;on, and all the &s;entiments
and pa&s;&s;ions which he feels from that &s;ituation. It is a joyous com|panion
who gives vent to the gaiety and mirth with which wine,
fe&s;tivity, and good company in&s;pire him. It is a lover who com|plains,
or hopes, or fears, or de&s;pairs. It is a generous man who
expre&s;&s;es either his gratitude for the favours, or his indignation at
the injuries, which may have been done to him. It is a warrior
who prepares him&s;elf to confront danger, and who provokes or de|fies
his enemy. It is a per&s;on in pro&s;perity who humbly returns
thanks for the goodne&s;s, or one in affliction who with contrition
implores the mercy and forgivene&s;s, of that invi&s;ible Power to whom
he looks up as the Director of all the events of human life. The
&s;ituation may comprehend, not only one, but two, three, or more
per&s;ons; it may excite in them all either &s;imilar or oppo&s;ite &s;enti|ments;
what is a &s;ubject of &s;orrow to one, being an occa&s;ion of joy
and triumph to another; and they may all expre&s;s, &s;ometimes &s;epa|rately
and &s;ometimes together, the particular way in which each of
them is affected, as in a duo, trio, or a chorus.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="241">
All this it may, and it frequently has been &s;aid is unnatural;
nothing being more &s;o, than to &s;ing when we are anxious to per|&s;uade,
or in earne&s;t to expre&s;s any very &s;erious purpo&s;e. But it
&s;hould be remembered, that to make a thing of one kind re&s;emble
another thing of a very different kind, is the very circum&s;tance
which, in all the Imitative Arts, con&s;titutcs the merits of imitation;
and that to &s;hape, and as it were to bend, the mea&s;ure and the me|lody
of Mu&s;ic, &s;o as to imitate the tone and the language of coun|&s;el
and conver&s;ation, the accent and the &s;tyle of emotion and pa&s;&s;ion,
is to make a thing of one kind re&s;emble another thing of a very dif|ferent
kind.</P>
<P>The tone and the movements of Mu&s;ic, though naturally very
different from tho&s;e of conver&s;ation and pa&s;&s;ion, may, however, be
&s;o managed as to &s;eem to re&s;emble them. On account of the great
di&s;parity between the imitating and the imitated object, the mind in
this, as in the other ca&s;es, cannot only be contented, but delighted,
and even charmed and tran&s;ported, with &s;uch an imperfect re&s;emblance
as can be had. Such imitative Mu&s;ic, therefore, when &s;ung to words
which explain and determine its meaning, may frequently appear to
be a very perfect imitation. It is upon this account, that even the
incomplete Mu&s;ic of a recitative &s;eems to expre&s;s &s;ometimes all the fe|datene&s;s
and compo&s;ure of &s;erious but calm di&s;cour&s;e, and &s;ometimes
all the exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting pa&s;&s;ion. The more
complete Mu&s;ic of an air is &s;till &s;uperior, and, in the imitation of
the more animated pa&s;&s;ions, has one great advantage over every &s;ort
of di&s;cour&s;e, whether Pro&s;e or Poetry, which is not &s;ung to Mu&s;ic.
In a per&s;on who is either much depre&s;&s;ed by grief or enlivened by
joy, who is &s;trongly affected either with love or hatred, with gra|titude
or re&s;entment, with admiration or contempt, there is com|monly
one thought or idea which dwells upon his mind, which con|tinually
<PB N="155" REF="242">
haunts him, which, when he has chaced it away, imme|diately
returns upon him, and which in company makes him ab&s;ent
and inattentive. He can think but of one object, and he cannot
repeat to them that object &s;o frequently as it recurs upon him. He
takes refuge in &s;olitude, where he can with freedom either indulge
the exta&s;y or give way to the agony of the agreeable or di&s;agreeable
pa&s;&s;ion which agitates him; and where he can repeat to him&s;elf, which
he does &s;ometimes mentally, and &s;ometimes even aloud, and almo&s;t
always in the &s;ame words, the particular thought which either de|lights
or di&s;tre&s;&s;es him. Neither Pro&s;e nor Poetry can venture to
imitate tho&s;e almo&s;t endle&s;s repetitions of pa&s;&s;ion. They may de|&s;cribe
them as I do now, but they dare not imitate them; they
would become mo&s;t in&s;ufferably tire&s;ome if they did. The Mu&s;ic
of a pa&s;&s;ionate air not only may, but frequently does, imitate them;
and it never makes its way &s;o directly or &s;o irre&s;i&s;tibly to the heart
as when it does &s;o. It is upon this account that the words of an
air, e&s;pecially of a pa&s;&s;ionate one, though they are &s;eldom very long,
yet are &s;carce ever &s;ung &s;traight an to the end, like tho&s;e of a recitative;
but are almo&s;t always broken into parts, which are tran&s;po&s;ed and
repeated again and again, according to the fancy or judgment of the
compo&s;er. It is by means of &s;uch repetitions only, that Mu&s;ic can
exert tho&s;e peculiar powers of imitation which di&s;tingui&s;h it, and in
which it excels all the other Imitative Arts. Poetry and Eloquence,
it has accordingly been often ob&s;erved, produce their effect always
by a connected variety and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of different thoughts and ideas:
but Mu&s;ic frequently produces its effects by a repetition of the &s;ame
idea; and the &s;ame &s;en&s;e expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame, or nearly the &s;ame,
combination of &s;ounds, though at fir&s;t perhaps it may make &s;carce
any impre&s;&s;ion upon us, yet, by being repeated again and again, it
comes at la&s;t gradually, and by little and little, to move, to agitate,
and to tran&s;port us.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="243">
To the&s;e powers of imitating, Mu&s;ic naturally, or rather nece&s;|&s;arily,
joins the happie&s;t choice in the objects of its imitation. The
&s;entiments and pa&s;&s;ions which Mu&s;ic can be&s;t imitate are tho&s;e
which unite and bind men together in &s;ociety; the &s;ocial, the decent,
the virtuous, the intere&s;ting and affecting, the amiable and agree|able,
the awful and re&s;pectable, the noble, elevating, and command|ing
pa&s;&s;ions. Grief and di&s;tre&s;s are intere&s;ting and affecting; hu|manity
and compa&s;&s;ion, joy and admiration, are amiable and agree|able;
devotion is awful and re&s;pectable; the generous contempt of
danger, the honourable indignation at inju&s;tice, are noble, elevating,
and commanding. But it is the&s;e and &s;uch like pa&s;&s;ions which
Mu&s;ic is fitte&s;t for imitating, and which it in fact mo&s;t frequently
imitates. They are, if I may &s;ay &s;o, all Mu&s;ical Pa&s;&s;ions; their
natural tones are all clear, di&s;tinct, and almo&s;t melodious; and they
naturally expre&s;s them&s;elves in a language which is di&s;tingui&s;hed by
pau&s;es at regular, and almo&s;t equal, intervals; and which, upon that
account, can more ea&s;ily be adapted to the regular returns of the
corre&s;pondent periods of a tune. The pa&s;&s;ions, on the contrary,
which drive men from one another, the un&s;ocial, the hateful, the
indecent, the vicious pa&s;&s;ions, cannot ea&s;ily be imitated by Mu&s;ic.
The voice of furious anger, for example, is har&s;h and di&s;cordant;
its periods are all irregular, &s;ometimes very long and &s;ometimes very
&s;hort, and di&s;tingui&s;hed by no regular pau&s;es. The ob&s;cure and
almo&s;t inarticulate grumblings of black malice and envy, the &s;cream|ing
outcries of da&s;tardly fear, the hideous growlings of brutal and
implacable revenge, are all equally di&s;cordant. It is with difficulty
that Mu&s;ic can imitate any of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, and the Mu&s;ic which
does imitate them is not the mo&s;t agreeable. A whole entertainment
may con&s;i&s;t, without any impropriety, of the imitation of the &s;ocial
and amiable pa&s;&s;ions. It would be a &s;trange entertainment which
con&s;i&s;ted altogether in the imitation of the odious and the vicious.
<PB N="157" REF="244">
A &s;ingle &s;ong expre&s;&s;es almo&s;t always &s;ome &s;ocial, agreeable, or inte|re&s;ting
pa&s;&s;ion. In an opera the un&s;ocial and di&s;agreeable are &s;ome|times
introduced, but it is rarely, and as di&s;cords are introduced into
harmony, to &s;et off by their contra&s;t the &s;uperior beauty of the op|po&s;ite
pa&s;&s;ions. What Plato &s;aid of Virtue, that it was of all beauties
the brighte&s;t, may with &s;ome &s;ort of truth be &s;aid of the proper and
natural objects of mu&s;ical imitation. They are either the &s;entiments
and pa&s;&s;ions, in the exerci&s;e of which con&s;i&s;t both the glory and the
happine&s;s of human life, or they are tho&s;e from which it derives its
mo&s;t delicious plea&s;ures, and mo&s;t enlivening joys; or, at the wor&s;t
and the lowe&s;t, they are tho&s;e by which it calls upon our indulgence
and compa&s;&s;ionate a&s;&s;i&s;tance to its unavoidable weakne&s;&s;es, its di&s;|tre&s;&s;es,

Mu&s;ic joins another peculiar and exqui&s;ite merit of its own. Sta|tuary
and Painting cannot be &s;aid to add any new beauties of their
own to the beauties of Nature which they imitate; they may a&s;|&s;emble
a greater number of tho&s;e beauties, and group them in a
more agreeable manner than they are commonly, or perhaps ever,
to be found in Nature. It may perhaps be true, what the arti&s;ts are
&s;o very fond of telling us, that no woman ever equalled, in all the
parts of her body, the beauty of the Venus of Medicis, nor any
man that of the Apollo of Belvidere. But they mu&s;t allow, &s;urely,
that there is no particular beauty in any part or feature of tho&s;e two
famous &s;tatues, which is not at lea&s;t equalled, if not much excelled,
by what is to be found in many living &s;ubjects. But Mu&s;ic, by ar|ranging,
and as it were bending to its own time and mea&s;ure,
whatever &s;entiments and pa&s;&s;ions it expre&s;&s;es, not only a&s;&s;embles and
groups, as well as Statuary and Painting, the different beauties of
Nature which it imitates, but it clothes them, be&s;ides, with a new
<PB N="158" REF="245">
and an exqui&s;ite beauty of its own; it clothes them with melody
and harmony, which, like a tran&s;parent mantle, far from concealing
any beauty, &s;erve only to give a brighter colour, a more enlivening
lu&s;tre, and a more engaging grace to every beauty which they
infold.</P>
<P>To the&s;e two different &s;orts of imitation,&mdash;to that general one, by
which Mu&s;ic is made to re&s;emble di&s;cour&s;e, and to that particular
one, by which it is made to expre&s;s the &s;entiments and feelings with
which a particular &s;ituation in&s;pires a particular per&s;on,&mdash;there is fre|quently
joined a third. The per&s;on who &s;ings may join to this
double imitation of the &s;inger the additional imitation of the actor;
and expre&s;s, not only by the modulation and cadence of his voice,
but by his countenance, by his attitudes, by his ge&s;tures, and by his
motions, the &s;entiments and feelings of the per&s;on who&s;e &s;ituation
is painted in the &s;ong. Even in private company, though a &s;ong
may &s;ometimes perhaps be &s;aid to be well &s;ung, it can never be
&s;aid to be well per&s;ormed, unle&s;s the &s;inger does &s;omething of this
kind; and there is no compari&s;on between the effect of what is &s;ung
coldly from a mu&s;ic-book at the end of a harp&s;ichord, and of what
is not only &s;ung, but acted with proper freedom, animation, and
boldne&s;s. An opera actor does no more than this; and an imitation
which is &s;o plea&s;ing, and which appears even &s;o natural, in private
&s;ociety, ought not to appear forced, unnatural, or di&s;agreeable upon
the &s;tage.</P>
<P>In a good opera actor, not only the modulations and pau&s;es of
his voice, but every motion and ge&s;ture, every variation, either in
the air of his head, or in the attitude of his body, corre&s;pond to
the time and mea&s;ure of Mu&s;ic: they corre&s;pond to the expre&s;&s;ion
of the &s;entiment or pa&s;&s;ion which the Mu&s;ic imitates, and that ex|pre&s;&s;ion
nece&s;&s;arily corre&s;ponds to this time and mea&s;ure. Mu&s;ic is
<PB N="159" REF="246">
as it were the &s;oul which animates him, which informs every feature
of his countenance, and even directs every movement of his eyes.
Like the mu&s;ical expre&s;&s;ion of a &s;ong, his action adds to the natural
grace of the &s;entiment or action which it imitates, a new and peculiar
grace of its own; the exqui&s;ite and engaging grace of tho&s;e ge&s;tures
and motions, of tho&s;e airs and attitudes which are directed by the
movement, by the time and mea&s;ure of Mu&s;ic; this grace heightens
and enlivens that expre&s;&s;ion. Nothing can be more deeply affecting
than the intere&s;ting &s;cenes of the &s;erious opera, when to good Poetry
and good Mu&s;ic, to the Poetry of Meta&s;ta&s;io and the Mu&s;ic of Per|gole&s;e,
is added the execution of a good actor. In the &s;erious opera,
indeed, the action is too often &s;acrificed to the Mu&s;ic; the ca&s;trati,
who perform the principal parts, being always the mo&s;t in&s;ipid and
mi&s;erable actors. The &s;prightly airs of the comic opera are, in the
&s;ame manner, in the highe&s;t degree enlivening and diverting. Though
they do not make us laugh &s;o loud as we &s;ometimes do at the &s;cenes
of the common comedy, they make us &s;mile more frequently; and
the agreeable gaiety, the temperate joy, if I may call it &s;o, with
which they in&s;pire us, is not only an elegant, but a mo&s;t delicious
plea&s;ure. The deep di&s;tre&s;s and the great pa&s;&s;ions of tragedy are
capable of producing &s;ome effect, though it &s;hould be but indiffer|ently
acted. It is not &s;o with the lighter misfortunes and le&s;s affect|ing
&s;ituations of comedy: unle&s;s it is at lea&s;t tolerably acted, it is
altogether in&s;upportable. But the ca&s;trati are &s;carce ever tolerable
actors; they are accordingly &s;eldom admitted to play in the comic
opera; which, being upon that account commonly better performed
than the &s;erious, appears to many people the better entertainment
of the two.</P>
<P>The imitative powers of In&s;trumental are much inferior to tho&s;e
of Vocal Mu&s;ic; its melodious but unmeaning and inarticulated
<PB N="160" REF="247">
&s;ounds cannot, like the articulations of the human voice, relate di&s;|tinctly
the circum&s;tances of any particular &s;tory, or de&s;cribe the dif|ferent
&s;ituations which tho&s;e circum&s;tances produced; or even ex|pre&s;s
clearly, and &s;o as to be under&s;tood by every hearer, the various
&s;entiments and pa&s;&s;ions which the parties concerned felt from the&s;e
&s;ituations: even its imitation of other &s;ounds, the objects which it
can certainly be&s;t imitate, is commonly &s;o indi&s;tinct, that alone, and
without any explication, it might not readily &s;ugge&s;t to us what was
the imitated object. The rocking of a cradle is &s;uppo&s;ed to be imi|tated
in that concerto of Correlli, which is &s;aid to have been com|po&s;ed
for the Nativity: but, unle&s;s we were told beforehand,
it might not readily occur to us what it meant to imitate, or
whether it meant to imitate any thing at all; and this imitation
(which, though perhaps as &s;ucce&s;sful as any other, is by no means
the di&s;tingui&s;hed beauty of that admired compo&s;ition) might only
appear to us a &s;ingular and odd pa&s;&s;age in Mu&s;ic. The ringing of
bells and the &s;inging of the lark and nightingale are imitated in the
&s;ymphony of In&s;trumental Mu&s;ic which Mr. Handel has compo&s;ed
for the Allegro and Pen&s;ero&s;o of Milton: the&s;e are not only &s;ounds
but mu&s;ical &s;ounds, and may therefore be &s;uppo&s;ed to be more
within the compa&s;s of the powers of mu&s;ical imitation. It is ac|cordingly
univer&s;ally acknowledged, that in the&s;e imitations this
great ma&s;ter has been remarkably &s;ucce&s;sful; and yet, unle&s;s the
ver&s;es of Milton explained the meaning of the Mu&s;ic, it might not
even in this ca&s;e readily occur to us what it meant to imitate, or
whether it meant to imitate any thing at all. With the explication
of the words, indeed, the imitation appears, what it certainly is, a
very &s;ine one; but without that explication it might perhaps appear
only a &s;ingular pa&s;&s;age, which had le&s;s connexion either with what
went before or with what came after it, than any other in the
Mu&s;ic.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="248">
In&s;trumental Mu&s;ic is &s;aid &s;ometimes to imitate motion; but in
reality it only either imitates the particular &s;ounds which accompany
certain motions, or it produces &s;ounds of which the time and mea|&s;ure
bear &s;ome corre&s;pondence to the variations, to the pau&s;es and
interruptions, to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive accelerations and retardations of the
motion which it means to imitate: it is in this way that it &s;ometimes
attempts to expre&s;s the march and array of an army, the confu&s;ion
and hurry of a battle, &amp;c. In all the&s;e ca&s;es, however, its imitation
is &s;o very indi&s;tinct, that without the accompaniment of &s;ome other
art, to explain and interpret its meaning, it would be almo&s;t always
unintelligible; and we could &s;carce ever know with certainty, either
what it meant to imitate, or whether it meant to imitate any thing
at all.</P>
<P>In the imitative arts, though it is by no means nece&s;&s;ary that the
imitating &s;hould &s;o exactly re&s;emble the imitated object, that the one
&s;hould &s;ometimes be mi&s;taken for the other, it is, however, nece&s;&s;ary
that they &s;hould re&s;emble at lea&s;t &s;o far, that the one &s;hould always
readily &s;ugge&s;t the other. It would be a &s;trange picture which re|quired
an in&s;cription at the foot to tell us, not only what particular
per&s;on it meant to repre&s;ent, but whether it meant to repre&s;ent a
man or a hor&s;e, or whether it meant to be a picture at all, and to
repre&s;ent any thing. The imitations of in&s;trumental Mu&s;ic may,
in &s;ome re&s;pects, be &s;aid to re&s;emble &s;uch pictures. There is, how|ever,
this very e&s;&s;ential difference between them, that the picture
would not be much mended by the in&s;cription; whereas, by what
may be con&s;idered as very little more than &s;uch an in&s;cription, in|&s;trumental
Mu&s;ic, though it cannot always even then, perhaps, be
&s;aid properly to imitate, may, however, produce all the effects of
the fine&s;t and mo&s;t perfect imitation. In order to explain in what
manner this is brought about, it will not be nece&s;&s;ary to d$&s;cend
into any great depth of philo&s;ophical &s;peculation.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="249">
That train of thoughts and ideas which is continually pa&s;&s;ing
through the mind does not always move on with the &s;ame pace, if
I may &s;ay &s;o, or with the &s;ame order and connection. When we are
gay and cheerful, its motion is bri&s;ker and more lively, our thoughts
&s;ucceed one another more rapidly, and tho&s;e which immediately fol|low
one another &s;eem frequently either to have but little connection,
or to be connected rather by their oppo&s;ition than by their mutual
re&s;emblance. As in this wanton and playful di&s;po&s;ition of mind
we hate to dwell long upon the &s;ame thought, &s;o we do not much
care to pur&s;ue re&s;embling thoughts; and the variety of contra&s;t is
more agreeable to us than the &s;amene&s;s of re&s;emblance. It is quite
otherwi&s;e when we are melancholy and de&s;ponding; we then fre|quently
find our&s;elves haunted, as it were, by &s;ome thought which
we would gladly cha&s;e away, but which con&s;tantly pur&s;ues us, and
which admits no followers, attendants, or companions, but &s;uch as
are of its own kindred and complexion. A &s;low &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of re|&s;embling
or clo&s;ely connected thoughts is the characteri&s;tic of this
di&s;po&s;ition of mind; a quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of thoughts, frequently con|tra&s;ted
and in general very &s;lightly connected, is the characteri&s;tic
of the other. What may be called the natural &s;tate of the mind,
the &s;tate in which we are neither elated nor dejected, the &s;tate of
&s;edatene&s;s, tranquillity, and compo&s;ure, holds a &s;ort of middle place
between tho&s;e two oppo&s;ite extremes; our thoughts &s;ucceed one
another more &s;lowly, and with a more di&s;tinct connection, than
in the one; more quickly, and with a greater variety, than in the
other.</P>
<P>Acute &s;ounds are naturally gay, &s;prightly, and enlivening; grave
&s;ounds &s;olemn, awful, and melancholy. There &s;eems too to be
&s;ome natural connection between acutene&s;s in tune and quickne&s;s in
time or &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as well as between gravity and &s;lowne&s;s: an acute
&s;ound &s;eems to fly off more quickly than a grave one: the treble is
<PB N="163" REF="250">
more cheerful than the ba&s;s; its notes likewi&s;e commonly &s;uc|ceed
one another more rapidly. But in&s;trumental Mu&s;ic, by a pro|per
arrangement, by a quicker or &s;lower &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of acute and
grave, of re&s;embling and contra&s;ted &s;ounds, can not only accommo|date
it&s;elf to the gay, the &s;edate, or the melancholy mood; but if
the mind is &s;o far vacant as not to be di&s;turbed by any di&s;orderly
pa&s;&s;ion, it can, at lea&s;t for the moment, and to a certain degree,
produce every po&s;&s;ible modification of each of tho&s;e moods or di&s;|po&s;itions.
We all readily di&s;tingui&s;h the cheerful, the gay, and the
&s;prightly Mu&s;ic, from the melancholy, the plaintive, and the affect|ing;
and both the&s;e from what holds a &s;ort of middle place between
them, the &s;edate, the tranquil, and the compo&s;ing. And we are
all &s;en&s;ible that, in the natural and ordinary &s;tate of the mind,
Mu&s;ic can, by a &s;ort of incantation, &s;ooth and charm us into
&s;ome degree of that particular mood or di&s;po&s;ition which accords
with its own character and temper. In a concert of in&s;trumental
Mu&s;ic the attention is engaged, with plea&s;ure and delight, to li&s;ten
to a combination of the mo&s;t agreeable and melodious &s;ounds, which
follow one another, &s;ometimes with a quicker, and &s;ometimes with
a &s;lower &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and in which tho&s;e that immediately follow one
another &s;ometimes exactly or nearly re&s;emble, and &s;ometimes con|tra&s;t
with one another in tune, in time, and in order of arrange|ment.
The mind being thus &s;ucce&s;&s;ively occupied by a train of ob|jects,
of which the nature, &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and connection corre&s;pond,
&s;ometimes to the gay, &s;ometimes to the tranquil, and &s;ometimes to
the melancholy mood or di&s;po&s;ition, it is it&s;elf &s;ucce&s;&s;ively led into
each of tho&s;e moods or di&s;po&s;itions; and is thus brought into a &s;ort
of harmony or concord with the Mu&s;ic which &s;o agreeably engages
its attention.</P>
<P>It is not, however, by imitation properly, that in&s;trumental Mu&s;ic
produces this effect: in&s;trumental Mu&s;ic does not imitate, as vocal
<PB N="164" REF="251">
Mu&s;ic, as Painting, or as Dancing would imitate, a gay, a &s;edate, or
a melancholy per&s;on; it does not tell us, as any of tho&s;e other arts
could tell us, a plea&s;ant, a &s;erious, or a melancholy &s;tory. It is not,
as in vocal Mu&s;ic, in Painting, or in Dancing, by &s;ympathy with
the gaiety, the &s;edatene&s;s, or the melancholy and di&s;tre&s;s of &s;ome
other per&s;on, that in&s;trumental Mu&s;ic &s;oothes us into each of the&s;e
di&s;po&s;itions: it becomes it&s;elf a gay, a &s;edate, or a melancholy ob|ject;
and the mind naturally a&s;&s;umes the mood or di&s;po&s;ition which
at the time corre&s;ponds to the object which engages its attention.
Whatever we feel from in&s;trumental Mu&s;ic is an original, and not a
&s;ympathetic feeling: it is our own gaiety, &s;edatene&s;s, or melan|choly;
not the reflected di&s;po&s;ition of another per&s;on.</P>
<P>When we follow the winding alleys of &s;ome happily &s;ituated and
well laid out garden, we are pre&s;ented with a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of land|&s;capes,
which are &s;ometimes gay, &s;ometimes gloomy, and &s;ome|times
calm and &s;erene; if the mind is in its natural &s;tate, it &s;uits
it&s;elf to the objects which &s;ucce&s;&s;ively pre&s;ent them&s;elves, and varies
in &s;ome degree its mood and pre&s;ent humour with every variation of
the &s;cene. It would be improper, however, to &s;ay that tho&s;e &s;cenes
imitated the gay, the calm, or the melancholy mood of the mind;
they may produce in their turn each of tho&s;e moods, but they can|not
imitate any of them. In&s;trumental Mu&s;ic, in the &s;ame manner,
though it can excite all tho&s;e different di&s;po&s;itions, cannot imitate
any of them. There are no two things in nature more perfectly
di&s;parate than &s;ound and &s;entiment; and it is impo&s;&s;ible by any hu|man
power to fa&s;hion the one into any thing that bears any real re|&s;emblance
to the other.</P>
<P>This power of exciting and varying the different moods and di&s;|po&s;itions
of the mind, which in&s;trumental Mu&s;ic really po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es to
a very con&s;iderable degree, has been the principal &s;ource of its re|putation
<PB N="165" REF="252">
for tho&s;e great imitative powers which have been a&s;cribed
to it. &startq;Painting,&endq; &s;ays an Author, more capable of feeling &s;trongly
than of anali&s;ing accurately, Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau of Geneva, &startq;Painting,
which pre&s;ents its imitations, not to the imagination, but to the
&s;en&s;es, and to only one of the &s;en&s;es, can repre&s;ent nothing be|&s;ides
the objects of &s;ight. Mu&s;ic, one might imagine, &s;hould be
equally confined to tho&s;e of hearing. It imitates, however, every
thing, even tho&s;e objects which are perceivable by &s;ight only.
By a delu&s;ion that &s;eems almo&s;t inconceivable, it can, as it were,
put the eye into the ear; and the greate&s;t wonder, of an art which
acts only by motion and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, is, that it can imitate re&s;t and
repo&s;e. Night, Sleep, Solitude, and Silence are all within the
compa&s;s of mu&s;ical imitation. Though all Nature &s;hould be a&s;leep,
the per&s;on who contemplates it is awake; and the art of the mu&s;i|cian
con&s;i&s;ts in &s;ub&s;tituting, in the room of an image of what is
not the object of hearing, that of the movements which its pre|&s;ence
would excite in the mind of the &s;pectator.&endq;&mdash;That is, of
the effects which it would produce upon his mood and di&s;po|&s;ition.
&startq;The mu&s;ician (continues the &s;ame Author) will &s;ome|times,
not only agitate the waves of the &s;ea, blow up the flames
of a conflagration, make the rain fall, the rivulets flow and &s;well
the torrents, but he will paint the horrors of a hideous de&s;art,
darken the walls of a &s;ubterraneous dungeon, calm the tempe&s;t,
re&s;tore &s;erenity and tranquillity to the air and the &s;ky, and &s;hed
from the orche&s;tre a new fre&s;hne&s;s over the groves and the fields.
He will not directly repre&s;ent any of the&s;e objects, but he will
excite in the mind the &s;ame movements which it would feel from
&s;eeing them.&endq;</P>
<P>Upon this very eloquent de&s;cription of Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau I mu&s;t ob|&s;erve,
that without the accompaniment of the &s;cenery and action of
the opera, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance either of the &s;cene-painter or of the
<PB N="166" REF="253">
poet, or of both, the in&s;trumental Mu&s;ic of the orche&s;tre could pro|duce
none of the effects which are here a&s;cribed to it; and we could
never know, we could never even gue&s;s, which of the gay, melan|choly,
or tranquil objects above mentioned it meant to repre&s;ent to
us; or whether it meant to repre&s;ent any of them, and not merely
to entertain us with a concert of gay, melancholy, or tranquil Mu&s;ic;
or, as the ancients called them, of the Dia&s;taltic, of the Sy&s;taltic,
or of the Middle Mu&s;ic. With that accompaniment, indeed, though
it cannot always even then, perhaps, be &s;aid properly to imitate,
yet by &s;upporting the imitation of &s;ome other art, it may produce
all the &s;ame effects upon us as if it&s;elf had imitated in the fine&s;t and
mo&s;t perfect manner. Whatever be the object or &s;ituation which
the &s;cene-painter repre&s;ents upon the theatre, the Mu&s;ic of the or|che&s;tre,
by di&s;po&s;ing the mind to the &s;ame &s;ort of mood and temper
which it would feel from the pre&s;ence of that object, or from &s;ym|pathy
with the per&s;on who was placed in that &s;ituation, can greatly
enhance the effect of that imitation: it can accommodate it&s;elf to
every diver&s;ity of &s;cene. The melancholy of the man who, upon
&s;ome great occa&s;ion, only finds him&s;elf alone in the darkne&s;s, the
&s;ilence and &s;olitude of the night, is very different from that of one
who, upon a like occa&s;ion, finds him&s;elf in the mid&s;t of &s;ome
dreary and inho&s;pitable de&s;ert; and even in this &s;ituation his feelings
would not be the &s;ame as if he was &s;hut up in a &s;ubterraneous
dungeon. The different degrees of preci&s;ion with which the Mu&s;ic
of the orche&s;tre can accommodate it&s;elf to each of tho&s;e diver&s;ities,
mu&s;t depend upon the ta&s;te, the &s;en&s;ibility, the fancy and imagina|tion
of the compo&s;er: it may &s;ometimes, perhaps, contribute to this
preci&s;ion, that it &s;hould imitate, as well as it can, the &s;ounds which
either naturally accompany, or which might be &s;uppo&s;ed to accom|pany,
the particular objects repre&s;ented. The &s;ymphony in the
French opera of Alcyone, which imitated the violence of the winds
and the da&s;hing of the waves, in the tempe&s;t which was to drown
<PB N="167" REF="254">
Coix, is much commended by cotemporary writers. That in the
opera of I&s;&s;e, which imitated that murmuring in the leaves of the
oaks of Dodona, which might be &s;uppo&s;ed to precede the mira|culous
pronunciation of the oracle: and that in the opera of
Amadis, of which the di&s;mal accents imitated the &s;ounds which
might be &s;uppo&s;ed to accompany the opening of the tomb of Ardan,
before the apparition of the gho&s;t of that warrior, are &s;till more ce|lebrated.
In&s;trumental Mu&s;ic, however, without violating too much
its own melody and harmony, can imitate but imperfectly the &s;ounds
of natural objects, of which the greater part have neither melody
nor harmony. Great re&s;erve, great di&s;cretion, and a very nice di&s;|cernment
are requi&s;ite, in order to introduce with propriety &s;uch im|perfect
imitations, either into Poetry or Mu&s;ic; when repeated too
often, when continued too long, they appear to be what they really
are, mere tricks, in which a very inferior arti&s;t, if he will only give
him&s;elf the trouble to attend to them, can ea&s;ily equal the greate&s;t.
I have &s;een a Latin tran&s;lation of Mr. Pope's Ode on St. Cecilia's
Day, which in this re&s;pect very much excelled the original. Such
imitations are &s;till ea&s;ier in Mu&s;ic. Both in the one art and in the
other, the difficulty is not in making them as well as they are ca|pable
of being made, but in knowing when and how far to make
them at all: but to be able to accommodate the temper and cha|racter
of the Mu&s;ic to every peculiarity of the &s;cene and &s;ituation
with &s;uch exact preci&s;ion, that the one &s;hall produce the very &s;ame
effect upon the mind as the other, is not one of tho&s;e tricks in
which an inferior arti&s;t can ea&s;ily equal the greate&s;t; it is an art
which requires all the judgment, knowledge, and invention of the
mo&s;t con&s;ummate ma&s;ter. It is upon this art, and not upon its im|perfect
imitation, either of real or imaginary &s;ounds, that the great
effects of in&s;trumental Mu&s;ic depend; &s;uch imitations ought per|haps
to be admitted only &s;o far as they may &s;ometimes contribute
<PB N="168" REF="255">
to a&s;certain the meaning, and thereby to enhance the effects of
this art.</P>
<P>By endeavouring to extend the effects of &s;cenery beyond what
the nature of the thing will admit of, it has been much abu&s;ed;
and in the common, as well as in the mu&s;ical drama, many imita|tions
have been attempted, which, after the fir&s;t and &s;econd time we
have &s;een them, nece&s;&s;arily appear ridiculous: &s;uch are, the Thun|der
rumbling from the Mu&s;tard-bowl, and the Snow of Paper and
thick Hail of Pea&s;e, &s;o finely expo&s;ed by Mr. Pope. Such imita|tions
re&s;emble tho&s;e of painted Statuary; they may &s;urprize at fir&s;t,
but they di&s;gu&s;t ever after, and appear evidently &s;uch &s;imple and ea&s;y
tricks as are fit only for the amu&s;ement of children and their nur&s;es
at a puppet-&s;how. The thunder of either theatre ought certainly
never to be louder than that which the orche&s;tre is capable of pro|ducing;
and their mo&s;t dreadful tempe&s;ts ought never to exceed
what the &s;cene painter is capable of repre&s;enting. In &s;uch imitations
there may be an art which merits &s;ome degree of e&s;teem and admira|tion.
In the other there can be none which merits any.</P>
<P>This abu&s;e of &s;cenery has both &s;ub&s;i&s;ted much longer, and been
carried to a much greater degree of extravagance, in the mu&s;ical
than in the common drama. In France It has been long bani&s;hed
from the latter; but it &s;till continues, not only to be tolerated, but
to be admired and applauded in the former. In the French operas,
not only thunder and lightning, &s;torms and tempe&s;ts, are com|monly
repre&s;ented in the ridiculous manner above mentioned, but
all the marvellous, all the &s;upernatural of Epic Poetry, all the meta|morpho&s;es
of Mythology, all the wonders of Witchcraft and Magic,
every thing that is mo&s;t unfit to be repre&s;ented upon the &s;tage, are
every day exhibited with the mo&s;t complete approbation and ap|plau&s;e
of that ingenious nation. The Mu&s;ic of the orche&s;tre pro|ducing
<PB N="169" REF="256">
upon the audience nearly the &s;ame effect which a better and
more artful imitation would produce, hinders them from feeling, at
lea&s;t in its full force, the ridicule of tho&s;e childi&s;h and aukward imi|tations
which nece&s;&s;arily abound in that extravagant &s;cenery. And
in reality &s;uch imitations, though no doubt ridiculous every where,
yet certainly appear &s;omewhat le&s;s &s;o in the mu&s;ical than they would
in the common drama. The Italian opera, before it was reformed
by Apo&s;tolo, Zeno, and Meta&s;ta&s;io, was in this re&s;pect equally ex|travagant,
and was upon that account the &s;ubject of the agreeable
raillery of Mr. Addi&s;on in &s;everal different papers of the Spectator.
Even &s;ince that reformation it &s;till continues to be a rule, that the
&s;cene &s;hould change at lea&s;t with every act; and the unity of place
never was a more &s;acred law in the common drama, than the viola|tion
of it has become in the mu&s;ical: the latter &s;eems in reality to
require both a more picture&s;que and a more varied &s;cenery, than is
at all nece&s;&s;ary for the former. In an opera, as the Mu&s;ic &s;up|ports
the effect of the &s;cenery, &s;o the &s;cenery often &s;erves to deter|mine
the character, and to explain the meaning of the Mu&s;ic; it
ought to vary therefore as that character varies. The plea&s;ure of an
opera, be&s;ides, is in its nature more a &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure, than that of
a common comedy or tragedy; the latter produce their effect prin|cipally
by means of the imagination: in the clo&s;et, accordingly,
their effect is not much inferior to what it is upon the &s;tage. But
the effect of an opera is &s;eldom very great in the clo&s;et; it addre&s;&s;es
it&s;elf more to the external &s;en&s;es, and as it &s;oothes the ear by its me|lody
and harmony, &s;o we feel that it ought to dazzle the eye with
the &s;plendour and variety of its &s;cenery.</P>
<P>In an opera the in&s;trumental Mu&s;ic of the orche&s;tre &s;upports the
imitation both of the poet and of the actor, as well as of the &s;cene|painter.
The overture di&s;po&s;es the mind to that mood which &s;its it
for the opening of the piece. The Mu&s;ic between the acts keeps
<PB N="170" REF="257">
up the impre&s;&s;ion which the foregoing had made, and prepares us
for that which the following is to make. When the orche&s;tre in|terrupts,
as it frequently does, either the recitative or the air, it is
in order either to enforce the effect of what had gone before, or to
put the mind in the mood which fits it for hearing what is to come
after. Both in the recitatives and in the airs it accompanies and
directs the voice, and often brings it back to the proper tone and
modulation, when it is upon the point of wandering away from
them; and the correctne&s;s of the be&s;t vocal Mu&s;ic is owing in a great
mea&s;ure to the guidance of in&s;trumental; though in all the&s;e ca&s;es it
&s;upports the imitation of another art, yet in all of them it may be
&s;aid rather to dimini&s;h than to increa&s;e the re&s;emblance between the
imitating and the imitated object. Nothing can be more unlike to
what really pa&s;&s;es in the world, than that per&s;ons engaged in the
mo&s;t intere&s;ting &s;ituations, both of public and private life, in &s;orrow,
in di&s;appointment, in di&s;tre&s;s, in de&s;pair, &s;hould, in all that they &s;ay
and do, be con&s;tantly accompanied with a fine concert of in&s;tru|mental
Mu&s;ic. Were we to reflect upon it, &s;uch accompaniment
mu&s;t in all ca&s;es dimini&s;h the probability of the action, and render
the repre&s;entation &s;till le&s;s like nature than it otherwi&s;e would be.
It is not by imitation, therefore, that in&s;trumental Mu&s;ic &s;upports
and enforces the imitations of the other arts; but it is by producing
upon the mind, in con&s;equence of other powers, the &s;ame &s;ort of
effect which the mo&s;t exact imitation of nature, which the mo&s;t
perfect ob&s;ervation of probability, could produce. To produce this
effect is, in &s;uch entertainments, the &s;ole end and purpo&s;e of that
imitation and ob&s;ervation. If it can be equally well produced by
other means, this end and purpo&s;e may be equally well an&s;wered.</P>
<P>But if in&s;trumental Mu&s;ic can &s;eldom be &s;aid to be properly imi|tative,
even when it is employed to &s;upport the imitation of &s;ome
other art, it is commonly &s;till le&s;s &s;o when it is employed alone.
<PB N="171" REF="258">
Why &s;hould it embarra&s;s its melody and harmony, or con&s;train its
time and mea&s;ure, by attempting an imitation which, without the
accompaniment of &s;ome other art to explain and interpret its mean|ing,
nobody is likely to under&s;tand? In the mo&s;t approved in|&s;trumental
Mu&s;ic, accordingly, in the overtures of Handel and the
concertos of Correlli, there is little or no imitation, and where there
is any, it is the &s;ource of but a very &s;mall part of the merit of tho&s;e
compo&s;itions. Without any imitation, instrumental Mu&s;ic can pro|duce
very con&s;iderable effects; though its powers over the heart and
affections are, no doubt, much inferior to tho&s;e of vocal Mu&s;ic, it
has, however, con&s;iderable powers: by the &s;weetne&s;s of its &s;ounds
it awakens agreeably, and calls upon the attention; by their con|nection
and affinity it naturally detains that attention, which follows
ea&s;ily a &s;eries of agreeable &s;ounds, which have all a certain relation
both to a common, fundamental, or leading note, called the key note;
and to a certain &s;ucce&s;&s;ion or combination of notes, called the &s;ong
or compo&s;ition. By means of this relation each foregoing &s;ound
&s;eems to introduce, and as it were prepare the mind for the follow|ing:
by its rythmus, by its time and mea&s;ure, it di&s;po&s;es that &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
of &s;ounds into a certain arrangement, which renders the whole
more ea&s;y to be comprehended and remembered. Time and mea|&s;ure
are to in&s;trumental Mu&s;ic what order and method are to di&s;|cour&s;e;
they break it into proper parts and divi&s;ions, by which we
are enabled both to remember better what is gone before, and fre|quently
to fore&s;ee &s;omewhat of what is to come after: we frequently
fore&s;ee the return of a period which we know mu&s;t corre&s;pond to
another which we remember to have gone before; and, according
to the &s;aying of an ancient philo&s;opher and mu&s;ician, the enjoy|ment
of Mu&s;ic ari&s;es partly from memory and partly from fore&s;ight.
When the mea&s;ure, after having been continued &s;o long as to &s;atisfy
us, changes to another, that variety, which thus di&s;appoints, becomes
more agreeable to us than the uniformity which would have gra|tified
<PB N="172" REF="259">
our expectation: but without this order and method we could
remember very little of what had gone before, and we could fore&s;ee
&s;till le&s;s of what was to come after; and the whole enjoyment of
Mu&s;ic would be equal to little more than the effect of the particular
&s;ounds which rung in our ears at every particular in&s;tant. By
means of this order and method it is, during the progre&s;s of the
entertainment, equal to the effect of all that we remember, and of
all that we fore&s;ee; and at the conclu&s;ion, to the combined and ac|cumulated
effect of all the different parts of which the whole was
compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>A well-compo&s;ed concerto of in&s;trumental Mu&s;ic, by the number
and variety of the in&s;truments, by the variety of the parts which
are performed by them, and the perfect concord or corre&s;pondence
of all the&s;e different parts; by the exact harmony or coincidence of
all the different &s;ounds which are heard at the &s;ame time, and by
that happy variety of mea&s;ure which regulates the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e
which are heard at different times, pre&s;ents an object &s;o agreeable,
&s;o great, &s;o various, and &s;o intere&s;ting, that alone, and without &s;ug|ge&s;ting
any other object, either by imitation or otherwi&s;e, it can oc|cupy,
and as it were fill up, completely the whole capacity of the
mind, &s;o as to leave no part of its attention vacant for thinking of
any thing el&s;e. In the contemplation of that immen&s;e variety of
agreeable and melodious &s;ounds, arranged and dige&s;ted, both in their
coincidence and in their &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, into &s;o complete and regular a
&s;y&s;tem, the mind in reality enjoys not only a very great &s;en&s;ual,
but a very high intellectual, plea&s;ure, not unlike that which it de|rives
from the contemplation of a great &s;y&s;tem in any other &s;cience.
A full concerto of &s;uch in&s;trumental Mu&s;ic, not only does not re|quire,
but it does not admit of any accompaniment. A &s;ong or a
dance, by demanding an attention which we have not to &s;pare,
would di&s;turb, in&s;tead of heightening, the effect of the Mu&s;ic; they
<PB N="173" REF="260">
may often very properly &s;ucceed, but they cannot accompany it.
That mu&s;ic &s;eldom means to tell any particular &s;tory, or to imitate
any particular event, or in general to &s;ugge&s;t any particular object,
di&s;tinct from that combination of &s;ounds of which it&s;elf is com|po&s;ed.
Its meaning, therefore, may be &s;aid to be complete in it&s;elf,
and to require no interpreters to explain it. What is called the &s;ub|ject
of &s;uch Mu&s;ic is merely, as has already been &s;aid, a certain
leading combination of notes, to which it frequently returns, and
to which all its digre&s;&s;ions and variations bear a certain affinity. It
is altogether different from what is called the &s;ubject of a poem or
a picture, which is always &s;omething which is not either in the
poem or in the picture, or &s;omething quite di&s;tinct from that com|bination,
either of words on the one hand, or of colours on the
other, of which they are re&s;pectively compo&s;ed. The &s;ubject of a
compo&s;ition of in&s;trumental Mu&s;ic is a part of that compo&s;ition:
the &s;ubject of a poem or picture is no part of either.</P>
<P>The effect of in&s;trumental Mu&s;ic upon the mind has been called
its expre&s;&s;ion. In the feeling it is frequently not unlike the effect
of what is called the expre&s;&s;ion of Painting, and is &s;ometimes equally
intere&s;ting. But the effect of the expre&s;&s;ion of Painting ari&s;es al|ways
from the thought of &s;omething which, though di&s;tinctly and
clearly &s;ugge&s;ted by the drawing and colouring of the picture, is alto|gether
different from that drawing and colouring. It ari&s;es &s;ome|times
from &s;ympathy with, &s;ometimes from antipathy and aver&s;ion
to, the &s;entiments, emotions, and pa&s;&s;ions which the countenance,
the action, the air and attitude of the per&s;ons repre&s;ented &s;ugge&s;t.
The melody and harmony of in&s;trumental Mu&s;ic, on the contrary,
do not di&s;tinctly and clearly &s;ugge&s;t any thing that is different from
that melody and harmony. Whatever effect it produces is the im|mediate
effect of that melody and harmony, and not of &s;omething
el&s;e which is &s;ignified and &s;ugge&s;ted by them: they in fact &s;ignify
<PB N="174" REF="261">
and &s;ugge&s;t nothing. It may be proper to &s;ay that the complete
art of painting, the complete merit of a picture, is compo&s;ed of
three di&s;tinct arts or merits; that of drawing, that of colouring, and
that of expre&s;&s;ion. But to &s;ay, as Mr. Avi&s;on does, that the com|plete
art of a mu&s;ician, the complete merit of a piece of Mu&s;ic, is
compo&s;ed or made up of three di&s;tinct arts or merits, that of me|lody,
that of harmony, and that of expre&s;&s;ion, is to &s;ay, that it is
made up of melody and harmony, and of the immediate and ne|ce&s;&s;ary
effect of melody and harmony: the divi&s;ion is by no means
logical; expre&s;&s;ion in painting is not the nece&s;&s;ary effect either of
good drawing or of good colouring, or of both together; a picture
may be both finely drawn and &s;inely coloured, and yet have very
little expre&s;&s;ion: but that effect upon the mind which is called ex|pre&s;&s;ion
in Mu&s;ic, is the immediate and nece&s;&s;ary effect of good
melody. In the power of producing this effect con&s;i&s;ts the e&s;&s;ential
characteri&s;tic which di&s;tingui&s;hes &s;uch melody from what is bad or
indifferent. Harmony may enforce the effect of good melody, but
without good melody the mo&s;t &s;kilful harmony can produce no
effect which de&s;erves the name of expre&s;&s;ion; it can do little more
than fatigue and confound the ear. A painter may po&s;&s;e&s;s, in a very
eminent degree, the talents of drawing and colouring, and yet po&s;|&s;e&s;s
that of expre&s;&s;ion in a very inferior degree. Such a painter, too,
may have great merit. In the judgment of Du Piles, even the ce|lebrated
Titian was a painter of this kind. But to &s;ay that a mu&s;i|cian
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the talents of melody and harmony in a very eminent
degree, and that of expre&s;&s;ion in a very inferior one, would be to
&s;ay, that in his works the cau&s;e was not followed by its nece&s;&s;ary
and proportionable effect. A mu&s;ician may be a very &s;kilful har|moni&s;t,
and yet be defective in the talents of melody, air, and ex|pre&s;&s;ion;
his &s;ongs may be dull and without effect. Such a mu&s;i|cian
too may have a certain degree of merit, not unlike that of a
man of great learning, who wants fancy, ta&s;te, and invention.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="262">
In&s;trumental Mu&s;ic, therefore, though it may, no doubt, be con|&s;idered
in &s;ome re&s;pects as an imitative art, is certainly le&s;s &s;o than
any other which merits that appellation; it can imitate but a few
objects, and even the&s;e &s;o imperfectly, that without the accompa|niment
of &s;ome other art, its imitation is &s;carce ever intelligible:
imitation is by no means e&s;&s;ential to it, and the principal effects
which it is capable of producing ari&s;es from powers altogether dif|ferent
from tho&s;e of imitation.</P>

<HEAD>PART III.</HEAD>
<P>THE imitative powers of Dancing are much &s;uperior to tho&s;e of
in&s;trumental Mu&s;ic, and are at lea&s;t equal, perhaps &s;uperior,
to tho&s;e of any other art. Like in&s;trumental Mu&s;ic, however, it is
not nece&s;&s;arily or e&s;&s;entially imitative, and it can produce very agree|able
effects, without imitating any thing. In the greater part of our
common dances there is little or no imitation, and they con&s;i&s;t almo&s;t
entirely of a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;uch &s;teps, ge&s;tures, and motions, regu|lated
by the time and mea&s;ure of Mu&s;ic, as either di&s;play extraor|dinary
grace or require extraordinary agility. Even &s;ome of our
dances, which are &s;aid to have been originally imitative, have,
in the way in which we practi&s;e them, almo&s;t cea&s;ed to be &s;o.
The minuet, in which the woman, after pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing the
man &s;everal times, fir&s;t gives him up one hand, then the other, and
then both hands, is &s;aid to have been originally a Moori&s;h dance,
which emblematically repre&s;ented the pa&s;&s;ion of love. Many of my
readers may have frequently danced this dance, and, in the opinion
<PB N="176" REF="263">
of all who &s;aw them, with great grace and propriety, though
neither they nor their &s;pectators once thought of the allegorical
meaning which it originally intended to expre&s;s.</P>
<P>A certain mea&s;ured, cadenced &s;tep, commonly called a dancing
&s;tep, which keeps time with, and as it were beats the mea&s;ure of,
the Mu&s;ic which accompanies and directs it, is the e&s;&s;ential charac|teri&s;tic
which di&s;tingui&s;hes a dance from every other &s;ort of motion.
When the dancer, moving with a &s;tep of this kind, and ob&s;erving
this time and mea&s;ure, imitates either the ordinary or the more im|portant
actions of human life, he &s;hapes and fa&s;hions, as it were, a
thing of one kind, into the re&s;emblance of another thing of a very
different kind: his art conquers the di&s;parity which Nature has
placed between the imitating and the imitated object, and has upon
that account &s;ome degree of that &s;ort of merit which belongs to all
the imitative arts. This di&s;parity, indeed, is not &s;o great as in
&s;ome other of tho&s;e arts, nor con&s;equently the merit of the imi|tation
which conquers it. Nobody would compare the merit of a
good imitative dancer to that of a good painter or &s;tatuary. The
dancer, however, may have a very con&s;iderable degree of merit,
and his imitation perhaps may &s;ometimes be capable of giving us as
much plea&s;ure as that of either of the other two arti&s;ts. All the
&s;ubjects, either of Statuary or of Hi&s;tory Painting, are within the
compa&s;s of his imitative powers; and in repre&s;enting them, his art
has even &s;ome advantage over both the other two. Statuary and
Hi&s;tory Painting can repre&s;ent but a &s;ingle in&s;tant of the action
which they mean to imitate: the cau&s;es which prepared, the con&s;e|quences
which followed, the &s;ituation of that &s;ingle in&s;tant are alto|gether
beyond the compa&s;s of their imitation. A pantomime dance
can repre&s;ent di&s;tinctly tho&s;e cau&s;es and con&s;equences; it is not con|fined
to the &s;ituation of a &s;ingle in&s;tant; but, like Epic Poetry, it
can repre&s;ent all the events of a long &s;tory, and exhibit a long train
<PB N="177" REF="264">
and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of connected and intere&s;ting &s;ituations. It is capable
therefore of affecting us much more than either Statuary or Paint|ing.
The ancient Romans u&s;ed to &s;hed tears at the repre&s;entations
of their pantomimes, as we do at that of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting tra|gedies;
an effect which is altogether beyond the powers of Sta|tuary
or Painting.</P>
<P>The ancient Greeks appear to have been a nation of dancers, and
both their common and their &s;tage dances &s;eem to have been all
imitative. The &s;tage dances of the ancient Romans appear to have
been equally &s;o. Among that grave people it was reckoned indecent
to dance in private &s;ocieties; and they could therefore have no com|mon
dances. Among both nations imitation &s;eems to have been
con&s;idered as e&s;&s;ential to dancing.</P>
<P>It is quite otherwi&s;e in modern times: though we have panto|mime
dances upon the &s;tage, yet the greater part even of our &s;tage
dances are not pantomime, and cannot well be &s;aid to imitate any
thing. The greater part of our common dances either never were
pantomime, or, with a very few exceptions, have almo&s;t all cea&s;ed
to be &s;o.</P>
<P>This remarkable difference of character between the ancient and
the modern dances &s;eems to be the natural effect of a corre&s;pondent
difference in that of the Mu&s;ic, which has accompanied and directed
both the one and the other.</P>
<P>In modern times we almo&s;t always dance to in&s;trumental Mu&s;ic,
which being it&s;elf not imitative, the greater part of the dances which
it directs, and as it were in&s;pires, have cea&s;ed to be &s;o. In ancient
times, on the contrary, they &s;eem to have danced almo&s;t always to
vocal Mu&s;ic; which being nece&s;&s;ary and e&s;&s;entially imitative, their
<PB N="178" REF="265">
dances became &s;o too. The ancients &s;eem to have had little or
nothing of what is properly called in&s;trumental Mu&s;ic, or of Mu&s;ic
compo&s;ed not to be &s;ung by the voice, but to be played upon in&s;tru|ments,
and both their wind and their &s;tringed in&s;truments &s;eem
to have &s;erved only as an accompaniment and direction to the
voice.</P>
<P>In the country it frequently happens that a company of young
people take a fancy to dance, though they have neither &s;iddler nor
piper to dance to. A lady undertakes to &s;ing while the re&s;t of the
company dance: in mo&s;t ca&s;es &s;he &s;ings the notes only, without the
words, and then the voice being little more than a mu&s;ical in&s;tru|ment,
the dance is performed in the u&s;ual way, without any imita|tion.
But if &s;he &s;ings the words, and if in tho&s;e words there
happens to be &s;omewhat more than ordinary &s;pirit and humour, im|mediately
all the company, e&s;pecially all the be&s;t dancers, and all
tho&s;e who dance mo&s;t at their ea&s;e, become more or le&s;s panto|mimes,
and by their ge&s;tures and motions expre&s;s, as well as they
can, the meaning and &s;tory of the &s;ong. This would be &s;till more
the ca&s;e, if the &s;ame per&s;on both danced and &s;ung; a practice very
common among the ancients: it requires good lungs and a vigor|ous
con&s;titution; but with the&s;e advantages and long practice, the
very highe&s;t dances may be performed in this manner. I have &s;een
a Negro dance to his own &s;ong, the war-dance of his own country,
with &s;uch vehemence of action and expre&s;&s;ion, that the whole com|pany,
gentlemen as well as ladies, got up upon chairs and tables,
to be as much as po&s;&s;ible out of the way of his fury. In the Greek
language there are two verbs which both &s;ignify to dance; each of
which has its proper derivatives, &s;ignifying a dance and a dancer.
In the greater part of Greek authors, the&s;e two &s;ets of words, like
all others which are nearly &s;ynonimous, are frequently confounded,

&s;trict propriety, one of the&s;e verbs &s;ignifies to dance and &s;ing at the

without &s;inging, or to dance to the mu&s;ic of other people. There
is &s;aid too to be a corre&s;pondent difference in the &s;ignification of
their re&s;pective derivatives. In the choru&s;es of the ancient Greek
tragedies, con&s;i&s;ting &s;ometimes of more than fifty per&s;ons, &s;ome

<HEAD>Of the Affinity between Mu&s;ic, Dancing, and Poetry.</HEAD>
<P>IN the &s;econd part of this E&s;&s;ay I have mentioned the connection
between the two arts of <HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> and <HI>Dancing</HI> formed by the <HI>Ryth|mus,</HI>
as the ancients termed it, or, as we call it, the tune or mea&s;ure
that equally regulates both.</P>
<P>It is not, however, every &s;ort of &s;tep, ge&s;ture, or motion, of
which the corre&s;pondence with the tune or mea&s;ure of Mu&s;ic will
con&s;titute a Dance. It mu&s;t be a &s;tep, ge&s;ture, or motion of a par|ticular
&s;ort. In a good opera-actor, not only the modulations and
<PB N="180" REF="267">
pau&s;es of his voice, but every motion and ge&s;ture, every variation,
either in the air of his head or in the attitude of his body, corre|&s;pond
to the time and meafure of Mu&s;ic. The be&s;t opera-actor, how|ever,
is not, according to the language of any country in Europe,
under&s;tood to dance, yet in the performance of his part he generally
makes u&s;e of what is called the &s;tage &s;tep; but even this &s;tep is not
under&s;tood to be a dancing &s;tep.</P>
<P>Though the eye of the mo&s;t ordinary &s;pectator readily di&s;tin|gui&s;hes
between what is called a dancing &s;tep and any other &s;tep,
ge&s;ture, or motion, yet it may not perhaps be very ea&s;y to expre&s;s
what it is which con&s;titutes this di&s;tinction. To a&s;certain exactly
the preci&s;e limits at which the one &s;pecies begins, and the other ends,
or to give an accurate definition of this very frivolous matter, might
perhaps require more thought and attention, than the very &s;mall
importance of the &s;ubject may &s;eem to de&s;erve. Were I, however,
to attempt to do this, I &s;hould ob&s;erve, that though in performing
any ordinary action&mdash;in walking, for example&mdash;from the one end of
the room to the other, a per&s;on may &s;how both grace and agility,
yet if he betrays the lea&s;t intention of &s;howing either, he is &s;ure of
offending more or le&s;s, and we never fail to accu&s;e him of &s;ome de|gree
of vanity and affectation. In the performance of any &s;uch
ordinary action, every per&s;on wi&s;hes to appear to be &s;olely occupied
about the proper purpo&s;e of the action: if he means to &s;how either
grace or agility, he is careful to conceal that meaning, and he is
very &s;eldom &s;ucce&s;sful in doing &s;o: he offends, however, ju&s;t in pro|portion
as he betrays it, and he almo&s;t always betrays it. In Dancing,
on the contrary, every per&s;on profe&s;&s;es, and avows, as it were, the
intention of di&s;playing &s;ome degree either of grace, or of agility,
or of both. The di&s;play of one, or other, or both of the&s;e qua|lities,
is in reality the proper purpo&s;e of the action; and there can
never be any di&s;agreeable vanity or affectation in following out the
<PB N="181" REF="268">
proper purpo&s;e of any action. When we &s;ay of any particular per|&s;on,
that he gives him&s;elf many affected airs and graces in Dancing,
we mean either that he gives him&s;elf airs and graces which are un|&s;uitable
to the nature of the Dance, or that he executes aukwardly,
perhaps exaggerates too much, (the mo&s;t common fault in Dancing,)
the airs and graces which are &s;uitable to it. Every Dance is in reality
a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of airs and graces of &s;ome kind or other, and of airs
and graces which, if I may &s;ay &s;o, profe&s;s them&s;elves to be &s;uch.
The &s;teps, ge&s;tures, and motions which, as it were, avow the in|tention
of exhibiting a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;uch airs and graces, are the
&s;teps, ge&s;tures, and motions which are peculiar to Dancing, and
when the&s;e are performed to the time and mea&s;ure of Mu&s;ic, they
con&s;titute what is properly called a Dance.</P>
<P>But though every &s;ort of &s;tep, ge&s;ture, or motion, even though
performed to the time and mea&s;ure of Mu&s;ic, will not alone make
a Dance, yet almo&s;t any &s;ort of &s;ound, provided it is repeated with
a di&s;tinct rythmus, or according to a di&s;tinct time and mea&s;ure,
though without any variation as to gravity or acutene&s;s, will make
a &s;ort of Mu&s;ic, no doubt indeed, an imperfect one. Drums, cym|bals,
and, &s;o far as I have ob&s;erved, all other in&s;truments of per|cu&s;&s;ion,
have only one note; this note, however, when repeated
with a certain rythmus, or according to a certain time and mea&s;ure,
and &s;ometimes, in order to mark more di&s;tinctly that time and
mea&s;ure, with &s;ome little variation as to loudne&s;s and lowne&s;s,
though without any as to acutene&s;s and gravity, does certainly make
a &s;ort of Mu&s;ic, which is frequently far from being di&s;agreeable,
and which even &s;ometimes produces con&s;iderable effects. The &s;imple
note of &s;uch in&s;truments, it is true, is generally a very clear, or
what is called a melodious, &s;ound. It does not however &s;eem in|di&s;pen&s;ably
nece&s;&s;ary that it &s;hould be &s;o. The &s;ound of the muffled
drum, when it beats the dead march, is far from being either clear
<PB N="182" REF="269">
or melodious, and yet it certainly produces a &s;pecies of Mu&s;ic, which
is &s;ometimes affecting. Even in the performance of the mo&s;t humble
of all arti&s;ts, of the man who drums upon the table with his &s;ingers,
we may &s;ometimes di&s;tingui&s;h the mea&s;ure, and perhaps a little of
the humour, of &s;ome favourite &s;ong; and we mu&s;t allow that even
he makes &s;ome &s;ort of Mu&s;ic. Without a proper &s;tep and motion,
the ob&s;ervation of tune alone will not make a Dance; time alone,
without tune, will make &s;ome &s;ort of Mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>That exact ob&s;ervation of tune, or of the proper intervals of
gravity and acutene&s;s, which con&s;titutes the great beauty of all perfect
Mu&s;ic, con&s;titutes likewi&s;e its great di&s;&s;iculty. The time or mea&s;ure
of a &s;ong are &s;imple matters, which even a coar&s;e and unpracti&s;ed ear
is capable of di&s;tingui&s;hing and comprehending: but to di&s;tingui&s;h
and comprehend all the variations of the tune, and to conceive with
preci&s;ion, the exact proportion of every note, is what the fine&s;t and
mo&s;t cultivated ear is frequently no more than capable of perform|ing.
In the &s;inging of the common people we may generally re|mark
a di&s;tinct enough ob&s;ervation of time, but a very imperfect one
of tune. To di&s;cover and to di&s;tingui&s;h with preci&s;ion the proper
intervals of tune, mu&s;t have been a work of long experience and
much ob&s;ervation. In the theoretical treati&s;es upon Mu&s;ic, what the
authors have to &s;ay upon time is commonly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in a &s;ingle
chapter of no great length or difficulty. The theory of tune &s;ills
commonly all the re&s;t of the volume, and has long ago become both
an exten&s;ive and an ab&s;tru&s;e &s;cience, which is often but imperfectly
comprehended, even by intelligent arti&s;ts. In the fir&s;t rude efforts
of uncivilized nations towards &s;inging, the niceties of tune could be
but little attended to: I have, upon this account, been frequently
di&s;po&s;ed to doubt of the great antiquity of tho&s;e national &s;ongs,
which it is pretended have been delivered down from age to age by
a &s;ort of oral tradition, without having been, ever noted, or di&s;tinctly
<PB N="183" REF="270">
recorded for many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive generations. The mea&s;ure, the hu|mour
of the &s;ong, might perhaps have been delivered down in this
manner, but it &s;eems &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible that the preci&s;e notes of the
tune &s;hould have been &s;o pre&s;erved. The method of &s;inging &s;ome
of what we reckon our old Scotch &s;ongs, has undergone great alter|ations
within the compa&s;s of my memory, and it may have un|dergone
&s;till greater before.</P>
<P>The di&s;tinction between the &s;ounds or tones of &s;inging and tho&s;e
of &s;peaking &s;eems to be of the &s;ame kind with that between the
&s;teps, ge&s;tures, and motions of Dancing, and tho&s;e of any other
ordinary action though in &s;peaking a per&s;on may &s;how a very
agreeable tone of voice, yet if he &s;eems to intend to &s;how it, if he
appears to li&s;ten to the &s;ound of his own voice, and as it were to
tune it into a plea&s;ing modulation, he never fails to offend, as guilty
of a mo&s;t di&s;agreeable affectation. In &s;peaking, as in every other
ordinary action, we expect and require that the &s;peaker &s;hould at|tend
only to the proper purpo&s;e of the action, the clear and di&s;tinct
expre&s;&s;ion of what he has to &s;ay. In &s;inging, on the contrary,
every per&s;on profe&s;&s;es the intention to plea&s;e by the tone and cadence
of his voice; and he not only appears to be guilty of no di&s;agree|able
affectation in doing &s;o, but we expect and require that he
&s;hould do &s;o. To plea&s;e by the choice and arrangement of agreeable
&s;ounds is the proper purpo&s;e of all Mu&s;ic, vocal as well as in&s;tru|mental;
and we always expect and require, that every per&s;on
&s;hould attend to the proper purpo&s;e of whatever action he is per|forming.
A per&s;on may appear to &s;ing, as well as to dance, affect|edly;
he may endeavour to plea&s;e by &s;ounds and tones which are
un&s;uitable to the nature of the &s;ong, or he may dwell too much on
tho&s;e which are &s;uitable to it, or in &s;ome other way he may &s;how
an overweening conceit of his own abilities, beyond what &s;eems to
be warranted by his performance. The di&s;agreeable affectation ap|pears
to con&s;i&s;t always, not in attempting to plea&s;e by a proper, but
<PB N="184" REF="271">
by &s;ome improper modulation of the voice. It was early di&s;covered
that the vibrations of chords or &s;trings, which either in their lengths,
or in their den&s;ities, or in their degrees of ten&s;ion, bear a certain
proportion to one another, produce &s;ounds which corre&s;pond ex|actly,
or, as the mu&s;icians &s;ay, are the uni&s;ons of tho&s;e &s;ounds or
tones of the human voice which the ear approves of in &s;inging.
This di&s;covery has enabled mu&s;icians to &s;peak with di&s;tinctne&s;s and
preci&s;ion concerning the mu&s;ical &s;ounds or tones of the human
voice; they can always preci&s;ely a&s;certain what are the particular
&s;ounds or tones which they mean, by a&s;certaining what are the pro|portions
of the &s;trings of which the vibrations produce the uni&s;ons
of tho&s;e &s;ounds or tones. What are called the intervals; that is,
the differences, in point of gravity and acutene&s;s, between the &s;ounds
or tones of a &s;inging voice, are much greater and more di&s;tinct than
tho&s;e of the &s;peaking voice. Though the former, therefore, can
be mea&s;ured and appreciated by the proportions of chords or &s;trings,
the latter cannot. The nice&s;t in&s;truments cannot expre&s;s the ex|treme
minutene&s;s of the&s;e intervals. The heptamerede of Mr. <HI>Sau|veur</HI>
could expre&s;s an interval &s;o &s;mall as the &s;eventh part of what
is called a comma, the &s;malle&s;t interval that is admitted in modern
Mu&s;ic. Yet even this in&s;trument, we are informed by Mr. <HI>Duclos,</HI>
could not expre&s;s the minutene&s;s of the intervals in the pronunci|ation
of the Chine&s;e language; of all the languages in the world,
that of which the pronunciation is &s;aid to approach the neare&s;t to
&s;inging, or in which the intervals are &s;aid to be the greate&s;t.</P>
<P>As the &s;ounds or tones of the &s;inging voice, therefore, can be
a&s;certained or appropriated, while tho&s;e of the &s;peaking voice can|not;
the former are capable of being noted or recorded, while the
latter are not.</P>

<P>THE mea&s;ure of the ver&s;es, of which the octave of the Italians,
their terzetti, and the greater part of their &s;onnets, are com|po&s;ed,
&s;eems to be as nearly the &s;ame with that of the Engli&s;h He|roic
Rhyme, as the different genius and pronunciation of the two
languages will permit.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h Heroic Rhyme is &s;uppo&s;ed to con&s;i&s;t &s;ometimes of
ten, and &s;ometimes of eleven &s;yllables: of ten, when the ver&s;e ends
with a &s;ingle; and of eleven, when it ends with a double rhyme.</P>
<P>The corre&s;pondent Italian ver&s;e is &s;uppo&s;ed to con&s;i&s;t &s;ometimes of
ten, &s;ometimes of eleven, and &s;ometimes of twelve &s;yllables, ac|cording
as it happens to end with a &s;ingle, a double, or a triple
rhyme.</P>
<P>The rhyme ought naturally to fall upon the la&s;t &s;yllable of the
ver&s;e; it is proper likewi&s;e that it &s;hould fall upon an accented &s;yl|lable,
in order to render it more &s;en&s;ible. When, therefore, the ac|cent
happens to fall, not upon the la&s;t &s;yllable, but upon that imme|diately
before it, the rhyme mu&s;t fall both upon the accented &s;yl|lable
and upon that which is not accented. It mu&s;t be a double
rhyme.</P>
<P>In the Italian language, when the accent falls neither upon the
la&s;t &s;yllable, nor upon that immediately before it, but upon the third
<PB N="188" REF="274">
&s;yllable from the end, the rhyme mu&s;t fall upon all the three. It
mu&s;t be a triple rhyme, and the ver&s;e is &s;uppo&s;ed to con&s;i&s;t of twelve
&s;yllables:
<Q>Fors&egrave; era ver, non per&ograve; cred&igrave;bile, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
Triple rhymes are not admitted into Engli&s;h Heroic Ver&s;e.</P>
<P>In the Italian language the accent falls much more rarely, either
upon the third &s;yllable from the end of a word, or upon the la&s;t
&s;yllable, than it does upon the one immediately before the la&s;t. In
reality, this &s;econd &s;yllable from the end &s;eems, in that language,
to be its mo&s;t common and natural place. The Italian Heroic
Poetry, therefore, is compo&s;ed principally of double rhymes, or of
ver&s;es &s;uppo&s;ed to con&s;i&s;t of eleven &s;yllables. Triple rhymes occur
but &s;eldom, and &s;ingle rhymes &s;till more &s;eldom.</P>
<P>In the Engli&s;h language the accent falls frequently upon the la&s;t
&s;yllable of the word. Our language, be&s;ides, abounds in words of
one &s;yllable, the greater part of which do (for there are few which
do not) admit of being accented. Words of one &s;yllable are mo&s;t
frequently the concluding words of Engli&s;h rhymes. For both
the&s;e rea&s;ons, Engli&s;h Heroic Rhyme is principally compo&s;ed of
&s;ingle rhymes, or of ver&s;es &s;uppo&s;ed to con&s;i&s;t of ten &s;yllables.
Double Rhymes occur almo&s;t as rarely in it, as either &s;ingle or triple
do in the Italian.</P>
<P>The rarity of double rhymes in Engli&s;h Heroic Ver&s;e makes them
appear odd, and aukward, and even ludicrous, when they occur.
By the be&s;t writers, therefore, they are re&s;erved for light and ludi|crous
occa&s;ions; when, in order to humour their &s;ubject, they &s;toop
to a more familiar &s;tyle than u&s;ual. When Mr. Pope &s;ays;
<Q><L>Worth makes the man, and want of it the fellow;</L>
<L>The re&s;t is all but leather or prunello;</L></Q>
<PB N="189" REF="275">
he means, in compliance with his &s;ubject, to conde&s;cend a good
deal below the &s;tateline&s;s of his diction in the E&s;&s;ay on Man.
Double rhymes abound more in Dryden than in Pope, and in Hu|dibras
more than in Dryden.</P>
<P>The rarity both of &s;ingle and of triple rhyme in Italian Heroic
Ver&s;e, gives them the &s;ame odd and ludicrous air which double
rhymes have in Engli&s;h Ver&s;e. In Italian, triple rhymes occur more
frequently than &s;ingle rhymes. The &s;lippery, or if I may be al|lowed
to u&s;e a very low, but a very expre&s;&s;ive word, the glib pro|nunciation
of the triple rhyme <HI>(ver&s;o &s;otrucciolo)</HI> &s;eems to depart
le&s;s from the ordinary movement of the double rhyme, than the
abrupt ending of the &s;ingle rhyme <HI>(ver&s;o tronco e cadente)</HI> of the
ver&s;e that appears to be cut off, and to fall &s;hort of the u&s;ual mea|&s;ure.
Single rhymes accordingly appear in Italian ver&s;e much more
burle&s;que than triple rhymes. Single rhymes occur very rarely in
Ario&s;to; but frequently in the more burle&s;que poem of Ricciar|detto.
Triple rhymes occur much oftener in all the be&s;t writers.
It is thus, that what in Engli&s;h appears to be the ver&s;e of the greate&s;t
gravity and dignity, appears in Italian to be the mo&s;t burle&s;que and
ludicrous; for no other rea&s;on, I apprehend, but becau&s;e in the one
language it is the ordinary ver&s;e, whereas in the other it departs the
mo&s;t from the movement of the ordinary ver&s;e.</P>
<P>The common Italian Heroic Poetry being compo&s;ed of double
rhymes, it can admit both of &s;ingle and of triple rhymes; which
&s;eem to recede from the common movement on oppo&s;ite &s;ides to
nearly equal di&s;tances. The common Engli&s;h Heroic Poetry, con|&s;i&s;ting
of &s;ingle rhymes, it can admit of double; but it cannot admit
of triple rhymes, which would recede &s;o far from the common
movements as to appear perfectly burle&s;que and ridiculous. In
<PB N="190" REF="276">
Engli&s;h, when a word accented upon the third &s;yllable from the
end happens to make the la&s;t word of a ver&s;e, the rhyme falls upon
the la&s;t &s;yllable only. It is a &s;ingle rhyme, and the ver&s;e con&s;i&s;ts of
no more than ten &s;yllables: but as the la&s;t &s;yllable is not accented, it
is an imperfect rhyme, which, however, when con&s;ined to the &s;e|cond
ver&s;e of the couplet, and even there introduced but rarely,
may have a very agreeable grace, and the line may even &s;eem to
run more ea&s;y and natural by means of it:
<Q><L>B&ugrave;t of this fr&agrave;me, the be&agrave;rings, and the t&igrave;es,</L>
<L>The &s;tr&igrave;ct conn&egrave;ctions, n&igrave;ce dep&egrave;ndencies, &amp;c.</L></Q>
When by a well accented &s;yllable in the end of the fir&s;t line of a
couplet, it has once been clearly a&s;certained what the rhyme is to be,
a very &s;light allu&s;ion to it, &s;uch as can be made by a &s;yllable of the
&s;ame termination that is not accented, may often be &s;ufficient to
mark the coincidence in the &s;econd line; a word of this kind in the
end of the fir&s;t line &s;eldom &s;ucceeds &s;o well:
<Q><L>Th' inhabitants of old Jeru&s;alem</L>
<L>Were Jebu&s;ites; the town &s;o called from them.</L></Q>
A couplet in which both ver&s;es were terminated in this manner,
would be extremely di&s;agreeable and offen&s;ive.</P>
<P>In counting the &s;yllables, even of ver&s;es which to the ear appear
&s;ufficiently correct, a con&s;iderable indulgence mu&s;t frequently be
given, before they can, in either language, be reduced to the preci&s;e
number of ten, eleven, or twelve, according to the nature of the
rhyme. In the following couplet, for example, there are, &s;trictly
&s;peaking, fourteen &s;yllables in the fir&s;t line, and twelve in the
&s;econd.

Though a line of Milton has not the ordinary movement of an
Engli&s;h. Heroic Ver&s;e, the accent falls upon the third and fifth
&s;yllables.</P>
<P>In Italian frequently, and in Engli&s;h &s;ometimes, an accent is with
great grace thrown upon the fir&s;t &s;yllable: in which ca&s;e it &s;eldom
happens that any other &s;yllable is accented before the fourth;
<Q><L>C&aacute;nto l'arm&eacute; piet&oacute;&s;e e'l capit&aacute;no.</L>
<L>F&iacute;r&s;t in the&s;e fi&eacute;lds I tr&yacute; the &s;ylvan &s;tr&aacute;ins.</L></Q></P>
<P>Both in Engli&s;h and in Italian the &s;econd &s;yllable may be accented
with great grace, and it generally is &s;o when the fir&s;t &s;yllable is not
accented:
<Q><L>E in van l'inferno a'lui s' oppo&s;e; e in vano</L>
<L>S' arm&oacute; d' A&s;ia, e di Libia il popol mi&s;to, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L>
<L>Let us, &s;ince life can little more &s;upply</L>
<L>Than ju&s;t to look about us, and to die, &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P>Both in Engli&s;h and in Italian Ver&s;e, an accent, though it mu&s;t
never be mi&s;placed, may &s;ometimes be omitted with great grace. In
the la&s;t of the above-quoted Engli&s;h Ver&s;es there is no accent upon
the eighth &s;yllable; the conjuncton <HI>and</HI> not admitting of any. In
the following Italian Ver&s;e there is no accent upon the &s;ixth
&s;yllable:
<Q>O Mu&s;a, tu, che di caduchi allori, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
The propo&s;ition <HI>di</HI> will as little admit of an accent as the conjunction
<HI>and.</HI> In this ca&s;e, however, when the even &s;yllable is not accented,
neither of the odd &s;yllables immediately before or behind it mu&s;t be
accented.</P>
<P>Neither in Engli&s;h nor in Italian can two accents running be
omitted.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="279">
It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that in Italian there are two accents, the
grave and the acute: the grave accent is always marked by a &s;light
&s;troke over the &s;yllable to which it belongs; the acute accent has no
mark.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h language knows no di&s;tinction between the grave and
the acute accents.</P>
<P>The &s;ame author ob&s;erves, that in the Italian Ver&s;e the Pau&s;e, or
what the grammarians call the Ce&s;ura, may with propriety be intro|duced
after either the third, the fourth, the fifth, the &s;ixth, or the
&s;eventh &s;yllables. The like ob&s;ervations have been made by &s;everal
different writers upon the Engli&s;h Heroic Ver&s;e. Dobie admires
particularly the ver&s;e in which there are two pau&s;es; one after the
fifth, and another after the ninth &s;yllable. The example he gives
is from Petrarch:
<Q>Nel dolce tempo de la prima etade, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
In this ver&s;e, the &s;econd pau&s;e, which he &s;ays comes after the ninth
&s;yllable, in reality comes in between the two vowels, which, in the
Italian way of counting &s;yllables, compo&s;e the ninth &s;yllable. It
may be doubtful, therefore, whether this pau&s;e may not be con|&s;idered
as coming after the eighth &s;yllable. I do not recollect any
good Engli&s;h Ver&s;e in which the pau&s;e comes in after the ninth
&s;yllable. We have many in which it comes in after the eighth:
<Q>Yet oft, before his infant eyes, would run, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
In which ver&s;e there are two pau&s;es; one after the &s;econd, and the
other after the eighth &s;yllable. I have ob&s;erved many Italian Ver&s;es
in which the pau&s;e comes after the &s;econd &s;yllable.</P>
<P>Both the Engli&s;h and the Italian Heroic Ver&s;e, perhaps, are not
&s;o properly compo&s;ed of a certain number of &s;yllables, which vary
<PB N="194" REF="280">
according to the nature of the rhyme; as of a certain number of
intervals, (of &s;ive invariably,) each of which is equal in length, or
time, to two ordinary di&s;tinct &s;yllables, though it may &s;ometimes
contain more, of which the extraordinary &s;hortne&s;s compen&s;ates the
extraordinary number. The clo&s;e frequently of each of tho&s;e in|tervals,
but always of every &s;econd interval, is marked by a di&s;tinct
accent. This accent may frequently, with great grace, fall upon
the beginning of the fir&s;t interval; after which, it cannot, without
&s;poiling the ver&s;e, fall any where but upon the clo&s;e of an interval.
The &s;yllable or &s;yllables which come after the accent that clo&s;es the
fifth interval are never accented. They make no di&s;tinct interval,
but are con&s;idered as a &s;ort of excre&s;cence of the ver&s;e, and are in
a manner counted for nothing.</P>

<P>THE Sen&s;es by which we perceive external objects, are com|monly
reckoned Five in Number; Seeing, Hearing, Smelling,
Ta&s;ting, and Touching.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e, the four fir&s;t mentioned are each of them confined to
particular parts or organs of the body; the Sen&s;e of Seeing is con|fined
to the Eyes; that of Hearing to the Ears; that of Smelling
to the No&s;trils; and that of Ta&s;ting to the Palate. The Sen&s;e of
Touching alone &s;eems not to be confined to any particular organ,
but to be diffu&s;ed through almo&s;t every part of the body; if we ex|cept
the hair and the nails of the fingers and toes, I believe through
every part of it. I &s;hall &s;ay a few words concerning each of the&s;e
Sen&s;es; beginning with the la&s;t, proceeding backwards in the op|po&s;ite
order to that in which they are commonly enumerated.</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Of the Sen&s;e of TOUCHING.</HEAD>
<P>THE objects of Touch always pre&s;ent them&s;elves as pre&s;&s;ing upon,
or as re&s;i&s;ting the particular part of the body which perceives them,
or by which we perceive them. When I lay my hand upon the
<PB N="198" REF="283">
table, the table pre&s;&s;es upon my hand, or re&s;i&s;ts the further motion
of my hand, in the &s;ame manner as my hand pre&s;&s;es upon the table.
But pre&s;&s;ure or re&s;i&s;tance nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es externality in the thing
which pre&s;&s;es or re&s;i&s;ts. The table could not pre&s;s upon, or re&s;i&s;t
the further motion of my hand, if it was not external to my hand.
I feel it accordingly, as &s;omething which is not merely an affection
of my hand, but altogether external to, and independant of my hand.
The agreeable, indifferent, or painful &s;en&s;ation of pre&s;&s;ure, accord|ing
as I happen to pre&s;s hardly or &s;oftly, I feel, no doubt, as af|fections
of my hand; but the thing which pre&s;&s;es and re&s;i&s;ts I feel
as &s;omething altogether different from tho&s;e affections, as external to
my hand, and as altogether independent of it.</P>
<P>In moving my hand along the table it &s;oon comes, in every di|rection,
to a place where this pre&s;&s;ure or &s;e&s;i&s;tance cea&s;es. This
place we call the boundary, or end of the table; of which the ex|tent
and figure are determined by the extent and direction of the
lines or &s;urfaces which con&s;titute this boundary or end.</P>
<P>It is in this manner that a man born blind, or who has lo&s;t his
&s;ight &s;o early that he has no remembrance of vi&s;ible objects, may
form the mo&s;t di&s;tinct idea of the extent and figure of all the dif|ferent
parts of his own body, and of every other tangible object
which he has an opportunity of handling and examining. When
he lays his hand upon his foot, as his hand feels the pre&s;&s;ure or re|&s;i&s;tance
of his foot, &s;o his foot feels that of his hand. They are
both external to one another, but they are, neither of them, alto|gether
&s;o external to him. He feels in both, and he naturally con|&s;iders
them as parts of him&s;elf, or at lea&s;t as &s;omething which be|longs
to him, and which, for his own happine&s;s and comfort, it is
nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould take &s;ome care of.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="284">
When he lays his hand upon the table, though his hand feels the
pre&s;&s;ure of the table, the table does not feel, at lea&s;t he does not
know that it feels, the pre&s;&s;ure of his hand. He feels it therefore as
&s;omething external, not only to his hand, but to him&s;elf, as &s;ome|thing
which makes no part of him&s;elf, and in the &s;tate and condition
of which he has not nece&s;&s;arily any concern.</P>
<P>When he lays his hand upon the body either of another man, or
of any other animal, though he knows, or at lea&s;t may know, that
they feel the pre&s;&s;ure of his hand as much as he feels that of their
body: Yet as this feeling is altogether external to him, he fre|quently
gives no attention to it, and at no time takes any further
concern in it than he is obliged to do by that fellow-feeling which
Nature has, for the wi&s;e&s;t purpo&s;es, implanted in man, not only
towards all other men, but (though no doubt in a much weaker
degree) towards all other animals. Having de&s;tined him to be the
governing animal in this little world, it &s;eems to have been her be|nevolent
intention to in&s;pire him with &s;ome degree of re&s;pect, even
for the meane&s;t and weake&s;t of his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>This power or quality of re&s;i&s;tance we call Solidity; and the
thing which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it, the Solid Body or Thing. As we feel it
as &s;omething altogether external to us, &s;o we nece&s;&s;arily conceive it
as &s;omething altogether independent of us. We con&s;ider it, there|fore,
as what we call a Sub&s;tance, or as a thing that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts by it|&s;elf,
and independent of any other thing. Solid and &s;ub&s;tantial,
accordingly, are two words which, in common language, are con|&s;idered
either as altogether, or as nearly &s;ynonimous.</P>
<P>Solidity nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es &s;ome degree of exten&s;ion, and that
in all the three directions of length, breadth, and thickne&s;s. All
the &s;olid bodies, of which we have any experience, have &s;ome
degree of &s;uch bulk or magnitude. It &s;eems to be e&s;&s;ential to
<PB N="200" REF="285">
their nature, and without it, we cannot even conceive how they
&s;hould be capable of pre&s;&s;ure or re&s;i&s;tance; the powers by which
they are made known to us, and by which alone they are capable of
acting upon our own, and upon all other bodies.</P>
<P>Exten&s;ion, at lea&s;t any &s;en&s;ible exten&s;ion, &s;uppo&s;es divi&s;ibility.
The body may be &s;o hard, that our &s;trength is not &s;ufficient to break
it: we &s;till &s;uppo&s;e, however, that if a &s;ufficient force were applied, it
might be &s;o broken; and, at any rate, we can always, in fancy at
lea&s;t, imagine it to be divided into two or more parts.</P>
<P>Every &s;olid and extended body, if it be not infinite, (as the uni|ver&s;e
may be conceived to be,) mu&s;t have &s;ome &s;hape or figure, or
be bounded by certain lines and &s;urfaces.</P>
<P>Every &s;uch body mu&s;t likewi&s;e be conceived as capable both of
motion and of re&s;t; both of altering its &s;ituation with regard to
other &s;urrounding bodies, and of remaining in the &s;ame &s;ituation.
That bodies of &s;mall or moderate bulk, are capable of both motion
and re&s;t we have con&s;tant experience. Great ma&s;&s;es, perhaps, are,
according to the ordinary habits of the imagination, &s;uppo&s;ed to be
more &s;itted for re&s;t than for motion. Provided a &s;ufficient force
could be applied, however, we have no difficulty in conceiving that
the greate&s;t and mo&s;t unwieldy ma&s;&s;es might be made capable of
motion. Philo&s;ophy teaches us, (and by rea&s;ons too to which it is
&s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to refu&s;e our a&s;&s;ent,) that the earth it&s;elf, and bodies
much larger than the earth, are not only moveable, but are at all
times actually in motion, and continually altering their &s;ituation,
in re&s;pect to other &s;urrounding bodies, with a rapidity that almo&s;t
pa&s;&s;es all human comprehen&s;ion. In the &s;y&s;tem of the univer&s;e, at
lea&s;t according to the imperfect notions which we have hitherto
been able to attain concerning it, the great difficulty &s;eems to be,
<PB N="201" REF="286">
not to find the mo&s;t enormous ma&s;&s;es in motion, but to find the
&s;malle&s;t particle of matter that is perfectly at re&s;t, with regard to
all other &s;urrounding bodies.</P>
<P>The&s;e four qualities, or attributes of exten&s;ion, divi&s;ibility, figure,
and mobility, or the capacity of motion or re&s;t, &s;eem nece&s;&s;arily
involved in the idea or conception of a &s;olid &s;ub&s;tance. They are,
in reality, in&s;eparable from that idea or conception, and the &s;olid
&s;ub&s;tance cannot po&s;&s;ibly be conceived to exi&s;t without them. No
other qualities or attributes &s;eem to be involved, in the &s;ame manner,
in this our idea or conception of &s;olidity. It would, however, be ra&s;h
from thence to conclude that the &s;olid &s;ub&s;tance can, as &s;uch, po&s;&s;efs
no other qualities or attributes. This very ra&s;h conclu&s;ion, not|with&s;tanding,
has been not only drawn, but in&s;i&s;ted upon, as an
axiom of the mo&s;t indubitable certainty, by philo&s;ophers of very
eminent reputation.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e external and re&s;i&s;ting &s;ub&s;tances, &s;ome yield ea&s;ily, and
change their figure, at lea&s;t in &s;ome degree, in con&s;equence of the
pre&s;&s;ure of our hand: others neither yield nor change their figure,
in any re&s;pect, in con&s;equence of the utmo&s;t pre&s;&s;ure which our
hand alone is capable of giving them. The former we call &s;oft,
the latter hard, bodies. In &s;ome bodies the parts are &s;o very ea&s;ily
&s;eparable, that they not only yield to a very moderate pre&s;&s;ure, but
ea&s;ily receive the pre&s;&s;ing body within them, and without much re|&s;i&s;tance
allow it to traver&s;e their extent in every po&s;&s;ible direction.
The&s;e are called Fluid, in contradi&s;tinction to tho&s;e of which the
parts not being &s;o ea&s;ily &s;eparable, are upon that account peculiarly
called Solid Bodies; as if they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in a more di&s;tinct and per|ceptible
manner, the characteri&s;tical quality of &s;olidity or the power
of re&s;i&s;tance. Water, however, (one of the fluids with which we
are mo&s;t familiar,) when confined on all &s;ides, (as in a hollow globe
<PB N="202" REF="287">
of metal, which is fir&s;t filled with it, and then &s;ealed hermetically,)
has been found to re&s;i&s;t pre&s;&s;ure as much as the harde&s;t, or what we
commonly call the mo&s;t &s;olid bodies.</P>
<P>Some fluids yield &s;o very ea&s;ily to the &s;lighte&s;t pre&s;&s;ure, that upon
ordinary occa&s;ions we are &s;carcely &s;en&s;ible of their re&s;i&s;tance; and are
upon that account little di&s;po&s;ed to conceive them as bodies, or as
things capable of pre&s;&s;ure and re&s;i&s;tance. There was a time, as we
may learn from Ari&s;totle and Lucretius, when it was &s;uppo&s;ed to
require &s;ome degree of philo&s;ophy to demon&s;trate that air was a
real &s;olid body, or capable of pre&s;&s;ure and re&s;i&s;tance. What, in
ancient times, and in vulgar apprehen&s;ions, was &s;uppo&s;ed to be
doubtful with regard to air, &s;till continues to be &s;o with regard to
light, of which the rays, however conden&s;ed or concentrated, have
never appeared capable of making the &s;malle&s;t re&s;i&s;tance to the
motion of other bodies, the characteri&s;tical power or quality of
what are called bodies, or &s;olid &s;ub&s;tances. Some philo&s;ophers ac|cordingly
doubt, and &s;ome even deny, that light is a material or
corporeal &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>Though all bodies or &s;olid &s;ub&s;tances re&s;i&s;t, yet all tho&s;e with
which we are acquainted appear to be more or le&s;s compre&s;&s;ible, or
capable of having, without any diminution in the quantity of their
matter, their bulk more or le&s;s reduced within a &s;maller &s;pace than
that which they u&s;ually occupy. An experiment of the Florentine
academy was &s;uppo&s;ed to have demon&s;trated that water was ab&s;o|lutely
incompre&s;&s;ible. The &s;ame experiment, however, having been
repeated with more care and accuracy, it appears, that water, though
it &s;trongly re&s;i&s;ts compre&s;&s;ion, is, however, when a &s;ufficientf force
is applied, like all other bodies, in &s;ome degree liable to it. Air,
on the contrary, by the application of a very moderate force, is
ea&s;ily reducible within a much &s;maller portion of &s;pace than that
<PB N="203" REF="288">
which it u&s;ually occupies. The conden&s;ing engine, and what is
founded upon it, the wind-gun, &s;ufficiently demon&s;trate this: and
even without the help of &s;uch ingenious and expen&s;ive machines,
we may ea&s;ily &s;atisfy our&s;elves of the truth of it, by &s;queezing a full|blown
bladder of which the neck is well tied.</P>
<P>The hardne&s;s or &s;oftne&s;s of bodies, or the greater or &s;maller force
with which they re&s;i&s;t any change of &s;hape, &s;eems to depend alto|gether
upon the &s;tronger or weaker degree of cohe&s;ion with which
their parts are mutually attracted to one another. The greater or
&s;maller force with which they re&s;i&s;t compre&s;&s;ion may, upon many
occa&s;ions, be owing partly to the &s;ame cau&s;e: but it may likewi&s;e
be owing to the greater or &s;maller proportion of empty &s;pace com|prehended
within their dimen&s;ions, or intermixed with the &s;olid
parts which compo&s;e them. A body which comprehended no empty
&s;pace within its dimen&s;ions, which, through all its parts, was com|pletely
filled with the re&s;i&s;ting &s;ub&s;tance, we are naturally di&s;po&s;ed
to conceive as &s;omething which would be ab&s;olutely incompre&s;&s;ible,
and which would re&s;i&s;t, with unconquerable force, every attempt to
reduce it within narrower dimen&s;ions. If the &s;olid and re&s;i&s;ting
&s;ub&s;tance, without moving out of its place, &s;hould admit into the
&s;ame place another &s;olid and re&s;i&s;ting &s;ub&s;tance, it would from that
moment, in our apprehen&s;ion, cea&s;e to be a &s;olid and re&s;i&s;ting &s;ub|&s;tance,
and would no longer appear to po&s;&s;e&s;s that quality, by which
alone it is made known to us, and which we therefore con&s;ider as
con&s;tituting its nature and e&s;&s;ence, and as altogether in&s;eparable from
it. Hence our notion of what has been called impenetrability of
matter; or of the ab&s;olute impo&s;&s;ibility that two &s;olid re&s;i&s;ting &s;ub|&s;tances
&s;hould occupy the &s;ame place at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>This doctrine, which is as old as Leucippus, Democritus, and
Epicurus, was in the la&s;t century revived by Ga&s;&s;endi, and has &s;ince
<PB N="204" REF="289">
been adopted by Newton and the far greater part of his followers.
It may at pre&s;ent be con&s;idered as the e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;y&s;tem, or as the
&s;y&s;tem that is mo&s;t in fa&s;hion, and mo&s;t approved of by the greater part
of the philo&s;ophers of Europe. Though it has been oppo&s;ed by
&s;everal puzzling arguments, drawn from that &s;pecics of metaphy&s;ics
which confounds every thing and explains nothing, it &s;eems upon
the whole to be the mo&s;t &s;imple, the mo&s;t di&s;tinct, and the mo&s;t
comprehen&s;ible account that has yet been given of the phoenomena
which are meant to be explained by it. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that
whatever &s;y&s;tem may be adopted concerning the hardne&s;s or &s;oft|ne&s;s,
the fluidity or &s;olidity, the compre&s;&s;ibility or incompre&s;&s;ibility,
of the re&s;i&s;ting &s;ub&s;tance, the certainty of our di&s;tinct &s;en&s;e and
feeling of its Externality, or of its entire independency upon the
organ which perceives it, or by which we perceive it, cannot in the
&s;malle&s;t degree be affected by any &s;uch &s;y&s;tem. I &s;hall not there|fore
attempt to give any further account of &s;uch &s;y&s;tems.</P>
<P>Heat and cold being felt by almo&s;t every part of the human body,
have commonly been ranked along with &s;olidity and re&s;i&s;tance,
among the qualities which are the objects of Touch. It is not,
however, I think, in our language proper to &s;ay that we touch, but
that we feel, the qualities of heat and cold. The word <HI>feeling,</HI>
though in many ca&s;es we u&s;e it as &s;ynonimous to <HI>touching,</HI> has, how|ever,
a much more exten&s;ive &s;ignification, and is frequently em|ployed
to denote our internal, as well as our external, affections.
We feel hunger and thir&s;t, we feel joy and &s;orrow, we feel love and
hatred.</P>
<P>Heat and cold, in reality, though they may frequently be per|ceived
by the &s;ame parts of the human body, con&s;titute an order of
&s;en&s;ations altogether different from tho&s;e which are the proper ob|jects
of Touch. They are naturally felt, not as preffing upon the
<PB N="205" REF="290">
organ, but as in the organ. What we feel while we &s;tand in the
&s;un&s;hine during a hot, or in the &s;hade during a fro&s;ty, day, is evi|dently
felt, not as preffing upon the body, but as in the body. It does
not nece&s;&s;arily &s;ugge&s;t the pre&s;ence of any external object, nor could
we from thence alone infer the exi&s;tence of any &s;uch object. It is
a &s;en&s;ation which neither does nor can exi&s;t any where but either in
the organ which feels it, or in the unknown principle of perception,
whatever that may be, which feels in that organ, or by means of that
organ. When we lay our hand upon a table, which is either heated
or cooled a good deal beyond the actual temperature of our hand,
we have two di&s;tinct perceptions: fir&s;t, that of the &s;olid or re&s;i&s;ting
table, which is nece&s;&s;arily felt as &s;omething external to, and inde|pendent
of, the hand which feels it: and &s;econdly, that of the heat
or cold, which by the contact of the table is excited in our hand,
and which is naturally felt as nowhere but in our hand, or in the
principle of perception which feels in our hand.</P>
<P>But though the &s;en&s;ations of heat and cold do not nece&s;&s;arily
&s;ugge&s;t the pre&s;ence of any external object, we &s;oon learn from ex|perience
that they are commonly excited by &s;ome &s;uch object;
&s;ometimes by the temperature of &s;ome external body immediately in
contact with our own body, and &s;ometimes by &s;ome body at either
a moderate or a great di&s;tance from us; as by the fire in a chamber,
or by the &s;un in a Summer's day. By the frequency and uniformity
of this experience, by the cu&s;tom and habit of thought which that
frequency and uniformity nece&s;&s;arily occa&s;ion, the Internal Sen&s;a|tion,
and the External Cau&s;e of that Sen&s;ation, come in our con|ception
to be &s;o &s;trictly connected, that in our ordinary and carele&s;s
way of thinking, we are apt to con&s;ider them as almo&s;t one and the
&s;ame thing, and therefore denote them by one and the &s;ame word.
The confu&s;ion, however, is in this ca&s;e more in the word than in
<PB N="206" REF="291">
the thought; for in reality we &s;till retain &s;ome notion of the di&s;|tinction,
though we do not always evolve it with that accuracy
which a very &s;light degree of attention might enable us to do.
When we move our hand, for example, along the &s;urface of a very
hot or of a very cold table, though we &s;ay that the table is hot
or cold in every part of it, we never mean that, in any part of it,
it feels the &s;en&s;ations either of heat or of cold, but that in every
part of it, it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the power of exciting one or other of tho&s;e
&s;en&s;ations in our bodies. The philo&s;ophers who have taken &s;o much
pains to prove that there is no heat in the fire, meaning that the
&s;en&s;ation or feeling of heat is not in the fire, have laboured to refute
an opinion which the mo&s;t ignorant of mankind never entertained.
But the &s;ame word being, in common language, employed to &s;ignify
both the &s;en&s;ation and the power of exciting that &s;en&s;ation, they,
without knowing it perhaps, or intending it, have taken advantage
of this ambiguity, and have triumphed in their own &s;uperiority,
when by irre&s;i&s;tible arguments they e&s;tabli&s;h an opinion which, in
words indeed, is diametrically oppo&s;ite to the mo&s;t obvious judg|ments
of mankind, but which in reality is perfectly agreeable to
tho&s;e judgments.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Sen&s;e of TASTING.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we ta&s;te any &s;olid or liquid &s;ub&s;tance, we have always two
di&s;tinct perceptions; fir&s;t, that of the &s;olid or liquid body, which is
naturally felt as pre&s;&s;ing upon, and therefore as external to, and in|dependent
of, the organ which feels it; and &s;econdly, that of the
particular ta&s;te, reli&s;h, or favour which it excites in the palate or
organ of Ta&s;ting, and which is naturally felt, not as pre&s;&s;ing upon,
as external to, or as independent of, that organ; but as altogether
<PB N="207" REF="292">
in the organ, and nowhere but in the organ, or in the principle of
perception which feels in that organ. When we &s;ay that the food
which we eat has an agreeable or di&s;agreeable ta&s;te in every part of
it, we do not thereby mean that it has the feeling or &s;en&s;ation of
ta&s;te in any part of it, but that in every part of it, it has the power
of exciting that feeling or &s;en&s;ation in our palates. Though in this
ca&s;e we denote by the &s;ame word (in the &s;ame manner, and for the
&s;ame rea&s;on, as in the ca&s;e of heat and cold) both the &s;en&s;ation and
the power of exciting that &s;en&s;ation, this ambiguity of language
mi&s;leads the natural judgments of mankind in the one ca&s;e as little
as in the other. Nobody ever fancies that our food feels its own
agreeable or di&s;agreeable ta&s;te.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Of the Sen&s;e of SMELLING.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY &s;mell or odour is naturally felt as in the no&s;trils; not as
pre&s;&s;ing upon or re&s;i&s;ting the organ, not as in any re&s;pect external
to, or independent of, the organ, but as altogether in the organ,
and nowhere el&s;e but in the organ, or in the principle of perception
which feels in that organ. We &s;oon learn from experience, how|ever,
that this &s;en&s;ation is commonly excited by &s;ome external body;
by a flower, for example, of which the ab&s;ence removes, and the pre|&s;ence
brings back, the &s;en&s;ation. This external body we con&s;ider as
the cau&s;e of this &s;en&s;ation, and we denominate by the &s;ame words both
the &s;en&s;ation and the power by which the external body produces
this &s;en&s;ation. But when we &s;ay that the &s;mell is in the flower, we
do not thereby mean that the flower it&s;elf has any feeling of the &s;en&s;a|tion
which we feel; but that it has the power of exciting this &s;en&s;a|tion
in our no&s;trils, or in the principle of perception which feels in
our no&s;trils. Though the &s;en&s;ation, and the power by which it is
<PB N="208" REF="293">
excited, are thus denoted by the &s;ame word, this ambiguity of
language mi&s;leads, in this ca&s;e, the natural judgments of mankind as
little as in the two preceding.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Of the Sen&s;e of HEARING.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY found is naturally felt as in the Ear, the organ of
Hearing. Sound is not naturally felt as re&s;i&s;ting or pre&s;&s;ing upon
the organ, or as in any re&s;pect external to, or independent of, the
organ. We naturally feel it as an affection of our Ear, as &s;ome|thing
which is altogether in our Ear, and nowhere but in our Ear,
or in the principle of perception which feels in our Ear. We &s;oon
learn from experience, indeed, that the &s;en&s;ation is frequently ex|cited
by bodies at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from us; often at a much
greater di&s;tance than tho&s;e ever are which excite the &s;en&s;ation of
Smelling. We learn too from experience, that this found or &s;en&s;a|tion
in our Ears receives different modifications, according to the
di&s;tance and direction of the body which originally cau&s;es it. The
&s;en&s;ation is &s;tronger, the found is louder, when that body is near.
The &s;en&s;ation is weaker, the found is lower, when that body is at a
di&s;tance. The found, or &s;en&s;ation, too undergoes &s;ome variation
according as the body is placed on the right hand or on the left,
before or behind us. In common language we frequently &s;ay, that
the found &s;eems to come from a great or from a &s;mall di&s;tance, from
the right hand or from the left, from before or from behind us. We
frequently &s;ay too that we hear a found at a great or a &s;mall di&s;|tance,
on our right hand or on our left. The real found, however,
the &s;en&s;ation in our ear, can never be heard or felt any where but
in our ear, it can never change its place, it is incapable of motion,
and can come, therefore, neither from the right nor from the left
<PB N="209" REF="294">
neither from before nor from behind us. The Ear can feel or hear
nowhere but where it is, and cannot &s;tretch out its powers of per|ception,
either to a great or to a &s;mall di&s;tance, either to the right
or to the left. By all &s;uch phra&s;es we in reality mean nothing but
to expre&s;s our opinion concerning either the di&s;tance, or the direc|tion
of the body, which excites the &s;en&s;ation of found. When we
&s;ay that the found is in the bell, we do not mean that the bell hears
its own &s;ound, or that any thing like our &s;en&s;ation is in the bell,
but that it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the power of exciting that &s;en&s;ation in our organ
of Hearing. Though in this, as well as in &s;ome other ca&s;es, we
expre&s;s by the &s;ame word, both the Sen&s;ation, and the Power of
exciting that Sen&s;ation; this ambiguity of language occa&s;ions &s;carce
any confu&s;ion in the thought, and when the different meanings of
the word are properly di&s;tingui&s;hed, the opinions of the vulgar, and
tho&s;e of the philo&s;opher, though apparently oppo&s;ite, turn out to
be exactly the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The&s;e four cla&s;&s;es of &s;econdary qualities, as philo&s;ophers have
called them, or to &s;peak more properly, the&s;e four cla&s;&s;es of Sen&s;a|tions;
Heat and Cold, Ta&s;te, Smell, and Sound; being felt, not
as re&s;i&s;ting or pre&s;&s;ing upon the organ; but as in the organ, are not
naturally perceived as external and independant &s;ub&s;tances; or even
as qualities of &s;uch &s;ub&s;tances; but as mere affections of the organ,
and what can exi&s;t nowhere but in the organ.</P>
<P>They do not po&s;&s;e&s;s, nor can we even conceive them as ca|pable
of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, any one of the qualities, which we con&s;ider as
e&s;&s;ential to, and in&s;eparable from, the external &s;olid and independ|ant
&s;ub&s;tances.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, They have no exten&s;ion. They are neither long nor &s;hort;
they are neither broad nor narrow; they are neither deep nor &s;hal|low.
<PB N="210" REF="295">
The bodies which excite them, the &s;paces within which they
may be perceived, may po&s;&s;e&s;s any of tho&s;e dimen&s;ions; but the
Sen&s;ations them&s;elves can po&s;&s;e&s;s none of them. When we &s;ay
of a Note in Mu&s;ie, that it is long or &s;hort, we mean that it is
&s;o in point of duration. In point of exten&s;ion we cannot even con|ceive,
that it &s;hould be either the one or the other.</P>
<P>Secondly, Tho&s;e Sen&s;ations have no figure. They are neither
round nor &s;quare, though the bodies which excite them, though
the &s;paces within which they may be perceived, may be either the
oue or the other.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Tho&s;e Sen&s;ations are incapable of motion. The bodies
which excite them may be moved to a greater or to a &s;maller di&s;|tance.
The Sen&s;ations become fainter in the one ca&s;e, and &s;tronger
in the other. Tho&s;e bodies may change their direction with regard
to the organ of Sen&s;ation. If the change be con&s;iderable, the
Sen&s;ations undergo &s;ome &s;en&s;ible variation in con&s;equence of it.
But &s;till we never a&s;cribe motion to the Sen&s;ations. Even when the
per&s;on who feels any of tho&s;e Sen&s;ations, and con&s;equently the
organ by which he feels them, changes his &s;ituation, we never,
even in this ca&s;e, &s;ay, that the Sen&s;ation moves, or is moved. It
&s;eems to exi&s;t always, where alone it is capable of exi&s;ting, in the
organ which feels it. We never even a&s;cribe to tho&s;e Sen&s;ations the
attribute of re&s;t; becau&s;e we never &s;ay that any thing is at re&s;t,
unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e it capable of motion. We never &s;ay that any
thing does not change its &s;ituation with regard to other things,
unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e it capable of changing that &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Fourthly, Tho&s;e Sen&s;ations, as they have no exten&s;ion, &s;o they
can have no divi&s;ibility. We cannot even conceive that a degree
<PB N="211" REF="296">
of Heat or Cold, that a Smell, a Ta&s;te, or a Sound, &s;hould be
divided (in the &s;ame manner as the &s;olid and extended &s;ub&s;tance
may be divided) into two halves, or into four quarters, or into any
other number of parts.</P>
<P>But though all the&s;e Sen&s;ations are equally incapable of divi&s;ion;
there are three of them, Ta&s;te, Smell, and Sound; which &s;eem
capable of a certain compo&s;ition and decompo&s;ition. A &s;kilful cook
will, by his ta&s;te, perhaps, &s;ometimes di&s;tingui&s;h the different
ingredients, which enter into the compo&s;ition of a new &s;auce, and
of which the &s;imple ta&s;tes make up the compound one of the &s;auce.
A &s;kilful perfumer may, perhaps, &s;ometimes be able to do the &s;ame
thing with regard to a new Scent. In a concert of vocal and in|in&s;trumental
mu&s;ic, an acute and experienced Ear readily di&s;tin|gui&s;hes
all the different &s;ounds which &s;trike upon it at the &s;ame
time, and which may, therefore, be con&s;idered as making up one
compound &s;ound.</P>
<P>Is it by nature, or by experience, that we learn to di&s;tingui&s;h
between &s;imple and compound Sen&s;ations of this kind? I am di&s;|po&s;ed
to believe that it is altogether by experience; and that na|turally
all Ta&s;tes, Smells, and Sounds, which affect the organ of
Sen&s;ation at the &s;ame time, are felt as &s;imple and uncompounded
Sen&s;ations. It is altogether by experience, I think, that we learn to
ob&s;erve the different affinities and re&s;emblances which the compound
Sen&s;ation bears to the different &s;imple ones, which compo&s;e it, and
to judge that the different cau&s;es, which naturally excite tho&s;e dif|ferent
&s;imple Sen&s;ations, enter into the compo&s;ition of that cau&s;e
which excites the compounded one.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="297">
It is &s;ufficiently evident that this compo&s;ition and decompo&s;ition
is altogether different from that union and &s;eparation of parts, which
con&s;titutes the divi&s;ibility of &s;olid exten&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Sen&s;ations of Heat and Cold &s;eem incapable even of this
&s;pecies of compo&s;ition and decompo&s;ition. The Sen&s;ations of Heat
and Cold may be &s;tronger at one time and weaker at another. They
may differ in degree, but they cannot differ in kind. The Sen&s;ations
of Ta&s;te, Smell, and Sound, frequently differ, not only in degree,
but in kind. They are not only &s;tronger and weaker, but &s;ome
Ta&s;tes are &s;weet and &s;ome bitter; &s;ome Smells are agreeable, and
&s;ome offen&s;ive; &s;ome Sounds are acute, and &s;ome grave; and each
of the&s;e different kinds or qualities too is capable of an immen&s;e
variety of different modifications. It is the combination of &s;uch
&s;imple Sen&s;ations, as differ not only in degree but in kind, which
con&s;titutes the compounded Sen&s;ation.</P>
<P>The&s;e four cla&s;&s;es of Sen&s;ations, therefore, having none of the
qualities which are e&s;&s;ential to, and in&s;eparable from, the &s;olid, ex|ternal,
and independant &s;ub&s;tances which excite them, cannot be
qualities or modifications of tho&s;e &s;ub&s;tances. In reality we do not
naturally con&s;ider them as &s;uch; though in the way in which we
expre&s;s our&s;elves on the &s;ubject, there is frequently a good deal of
ambiguity and confu&s;ion. When the different meanings of words,
however, are fairly di&s;tingui&s;hed, the&s;e Sen&s;ations are, even by the
mo&s;t ignorant and illiterate, under&s;tood to be, not the qualities, but
merely the effects of the &s;olid, external, and independant &s;ub&s;tances
upon the &s;en&s;ible and living organ, or upon the principle of percep|tion
which feels in that organ.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="298">
Philo&s;ophers, however, have not in general &s;uppo&s;ed that tho&s;e
exciting bodies produce tho&s;e Sen&s;ations immediately, but by the
intervention of one, two, or more intermediate cau&s;es.</P>
<P>In the Sen&s;ation of Ta&s;te, for example, though the exciting body
pre&s;&s;es upon the organ of Sen&s;ation, this pre&s;&s;ure is not &s;uppo&s;ed to
be the immediate cau&s;e of the Sen&s;ation of Ta&s;te. Certain juices of
the exciting body are &s;uppo&s;ed to enter the pores of the palate, and
to excite, in the irritable and &s;en&s;ible fibres of that organ, certain
motions or vibrations, which produce there the Sen&s;ation of Ta&s;te.
But how tho&s;e juices &s;hould excite &s;uch motions, or how &s;uch mo|tions
&s;hould produce, either in the organ, or in the principle of
perception which feels in the organ, the Sen&s;ation of Ta&s;te; or a
Sen&s;ation, which not only does not bear the &s;malle&s;t re&s;emblance to
any motion, but which it&s;elf &s;eems incapable of all motion, no
philo&s;opher has yet attempted, nor probably ever will attempt to
explain to us.</P>
<P>The Sen&s;ations of Heat and Cold, of Smell and Sound, are fre|quently
excited by bodies at a di&s;tance, &s;ometimes at a great di&s;|tance,
from the organ which feels them. But it is a very antient
and well-e&s;tabli&s;hed axiom in metaphy&s;ics, that nothing can act
where it is not; and this axiom, it mu&s;t, I think, be acknowledged,
is at lea&s;t perfectly agreeable to our natural and u&s;ual habits of
thinking.</P>
<P>The Sun, the great &s;ource of both Heat and Light, is at an im|men&s;e
di&s;tance from us. His rays, however, (traver&s;ing, with
inconceivable rapidity, the immen&s;ity of the intervening regions,)
as they convey the Sen&s;ation of Light to our eyes, &s;o they convey
that of Heat to all the &s;en&s;ible parts of our body. They even con|vey
the power of exciting that Sen&s;ation to all the other bodies that
<PB N="214" REF="299">
&s;urround us. They warm the earth, and air, we &s;ay; that is, they
convey to the earth and the air the power of exciting that Sen&s;ation
in our bodies. A common fire produces, in the &s;ame manner, all
the &s;ame effects; though the &s;phere of its action is confined within
much narrower limits.</P>
<P>The odoriferous body, which is generally too at &s;ome di&s;tance
from us, is &s;uppo&s;ed to act upon our organs by means of certain
&s;mall particles of matter, called E&s;fluvia, which being &s;ent &s;orth in
all po&s;&s;ible directions, and drawn into our no&s;trils by the in&s;piration
of breathing, produce there the Sen&s;ation of Smell. The minute|ne&s;s
of tho&s;e &s;mall particles of matter, however, mu&s;t &s;urpa&s;s all
human comprehen&s;ion. Inclo&s;e in a gold box, for a few hours, a
&s;mall quantity of mu&s;k. Take out the mu&s;k, and clean the box
with &s;oap and water as carefully as it is po&s;&s;ible. Nothing can be
&s;uppo&s;ed to remain in the box, but &s;uch effluvia as, having pene|trated
into its interior pores, may have e&s;caped the effects of
this clean&s;ing. The box, however, will retain the &s;mell of mu&s;k
for many, I do not know for how many years; and the&s;e effluvia,
how minute &s;oever we may &s;uppo&s;e them, mu&s;t have had the
powers of &s;ubdividing them&s;elves, and of emitting other effluvia of
the &s;ame kind, continually, and without any interruption, during
&s;o long a period. The nice&s;t balance, however, which human art
has been able to invent, will not &s;how the &s;malle&s;t increa&s;e of
weight in the box immediately after it has been thus carefully
cleaned.</P>
<P>The Sen&s;ation of Sound is frequently felt at a much greater di&s;|tance
from the &s;ounding, than that of Smell ever is from the odo|riferous
body. The vibrations of the &s;ounding body, however, are
&s;uppo&s;ed to produce certain corre&s;pondent vibrations and pul&s;es
in the &s;urrounding atmo&s;phere, which being propagated in all
<PB N="215" REF="300">
directions, reach our organ of Hearing, and produce there the
Sen&s;ation of Sound. There are not many philo&s;ophical doctrines,
perhaps, e&s;tabli&s;hed upon a more probable foundation, than that of
the propagation of Sound by means of the pul&s;es or vibrations of
the air. The experiment of the bell, which, in an exhau&s;ted re|ceiver,
produces no &s;en&s;ible Sound, would alone render this doctrine
&s;omewhat more than probable. But this great probability is &s;till
further confirmed by the computations of Sir I&s;aac Newton, who
has &s;hown that, what is called the velocity of Sound, or the time
which pa&s;&s;es between the commencement of the action of the &s;ound|ing
body, and that of the Sen&s;ation in our ear, is perfectly &s;uitable
to the velocity with which the pul&s;es and vibrations of an ela&s;tic
fluid of the &s;ame den&s;ity with the air, are naturally propagated.
Dr. Franklin has made objections to this doctrine, but, I think,
without &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Such are the intermediate cau&s;es by which philo&s;ophers have
endeavoured to connect the Sen&s;ations in our organs, with the
di&s;tant bodies which excite them. How tho&s;e intermediate cau&s;es,
by the different motions and vibrations which they may be &s;uppo&s;ed
to excite on our organs, produce there tho&s;e different Sen&s;ations,
none of which bear the &s;malle&s;t re&s;emblance to vibration or motion
of any kind, no philo&s;opher has yet attempted to explain to us.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Sen&s;e of SEEING.</HEAD>
<P>DR. BERKLEY, in his New Theory of Vi&s;ion, one of the fine&s;t
examples of philo&s;ophical analy&s;is that is to be found, either in our
own, or in any other language, has explained, &s;o very di&s;tinctly,
the nature of the objects of Sight: their di&s;&s;imilitude to, as well
as their corre&s;pondence and connection with tho&s;e of Touch,
<PB N="216" REF="301">
that I have &s;carcely any thing to add to what he has already done.
It is only in order to render &s;ome things, which I &s;hall have occa|&s;ion
to &s;ay hereafter, intelligible to &s;uch readers as may not have
had an opportunity of &s;tudying his book, that I have pre&s;umed
to treat of the &s;ame &s;ubject, after &s;o great a Ma&s;ter. Whatever I
&s;hall &s;ay upon it, if not directly borrowed from him, has at lea&s;t
been &s;ugge&s;ted by what he has already &s;aid.</P>
<P>That the objects of Sight are not perceived as re&s;i&s;ting or pre&s;&s;ing
upon the organ which perceives them, is &s;ufficiently obvious. They
cannot therefore &s;ugge&s;t, at lea&s;t in the &s;ame manner, as the objects
of Touch, the externality and independency of their exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>We are apt, however, to imagine that we &s;ee objects at a di&s;|tance
from us, and that con&s;equently the externality of their exi&s;t|ence
is immediately perceived by our Sight. But if we con&s;ider
that the di&s;tance of any object from the eye, is a line turned end|ways
to it; and that this line mu&s;t con&s;equently appear to it but
as one point; we &s;hall be &s;en&s;ible that di&s;tance from the eye cannot
be the immediate object of Sight, but that all vi&s;ible objects mu&s;t
naturally be perceived as clo&s;e upon the organ, or more properly,
perhaps, like all other Sen&s;ations, as in the organ which perceives
them. That the objects of Sight are all painted in the bottom of
the eye, upon a membrane called the <HI>retina,</HI> pretty much in the
&s;ame manner as the like objects are painted in a Camera Ob&s;cura, is
well known to whoever has the &s;lighte&s;t tincture of the &s;cience of
Optics; and the principle of perception, it is probable, originally
perceives them, as exi&s;ting in that part of the organ, and nowhere
but in that part of the organ. No Optician, accordingly, no per|&s;on
who has ever be&s;towed any moderate degree of attention upon
the nature of Vi&s;ion, has ever pretended that di&s;tance from the eye
was the immediate object of Sight. How it is that, by means of
<PB N="217" REF="302">
our Sight, we learn to judge of &s;uch di&s;tances, Opticians have
endeavoured to explain in &s;everal different ways. I &s;hall not, how|ever,
at pre&s;ent, &s;top to examine their &s;y&s;tems.</P>
<P>The objects of Touch are &s;olidity, and tho&s;e modifications of
&s;olidity which we con&s;ider as e&s;&s;ential to it, and in&s;eparable from it;
&s;olid exten&s;ion, figure, divi&s;ibility, and mobility.</P>
<P>The objects of Sight are colour, and tho&s;e modifications of colour
which, in the &s;ame manner, we con&s;ider as e&s;&s;ential to it, and in&s;e|parable
from it; coloured exten&s;ion, figure, divi&s;ibility, and mo|bility.
When we open our eyes, the &s;en&s;ible coloured objects,
which pre&s;ent them&s;elves to us, mu&s;t all have a certain exten&s;ion,
or mu&s;t occupy a certain portion of the vi&s;ible &s;urface which ap|pears
before us. They mu&s;t too have all a certain figure, or mu&s;t
be bounded by certain vi&s;ible lines, which mark upon that &s;urface
the extent of their re&s;pective dimen&s;ions. Every &s;en&s;ible portion of
this vi&s;ible or coloured exten&s;ion mu&s;t be conceived as divi&s;ible, or
as &s;eparable into two, three, or more parts. Every portion too of
this vi&s;ible or coloured &s;urface mu&s;t be conceived as moveable, or as
capable of changing its &s;ituation, and of a&s;&s;uming a different ar|rangement
with regard to the other portions of the &s;ame &s;urface.</P>
<P>Colour, the vi&s;ible, bears no re&s;emblance to &s;olidity, the tangible
object. A man born blind, or who has lo&s;t his Sight &s;o early as to
have no remembrance of vi&s;ible objects, can form no idea or con|ception
of colour. Touch alone can never help him to it. I have
heard, indeed, of &s;ome per&s;ons who had lo&s;t their Sight after the age
of manhood, and who had learned to di&s;tingui&s;h, by the Touch alone,
the different colours of cloths or &s;ilks, the goods which it happened to
be their bu&s;ine&s;s to deal in. The powers by which different bodies
<PB N="218" REF="303">
excite in the organs of the Sen&s;ations of different colours,
probably depend upon &s;ome difference in the nature, configuration,
and arrangement of the parts which compo&s;e their re&s;pective &s;ur|faces.
This difference may, to a very nice and delicate touch, make
&s;ome difference in the feeling, &s;ufficient to enable a per&s;on, much
intere&s;ted in the ca&s;e, to make this di&s;tinction in &s;ome degree,
though probably in a very imperfect and inaccurate one. A man
born blind might po&s;&s;ibly be taught to make the &s;ame di&s;tinctions.
But though he might thus be able to name the different colours,
which tho&s;e different &s;urfaces reflected, though he might thus have
&s;ome imperfect notion of the remote cau&s;es of the&s;e Sen&s;ations, he
could have no better idea of the Sen&s;ations them&s;elves, than that
other blind man, mentioned by Mr. Locke, had, who &s;aid that he
imagined the Colour of Scarlet re&s;embled the Sound of a Trumpet.
A man born deaf may, in the &s;ame manner, be taught to &s;peak
articulately. He is taught how to &s;hape and di&s;po&s;e of his organs,
&s;o as to pronounce each letter, &s;yllable, and word. But &s;till, though
he may have &s;ome imperfect idea of the remote cau&s;es of the
Sounds which he him&s;elf utters, of the remote cau&s;es of the Sen&s;a|tions
which he him&s;elf excites in other people; he can have none
of tho&s;e Sounds or Sen&s;ations them&s;elves.</P>
<P>If it were po&s;&s;ible, in the &s;ame manner, that a man could be
born without the Sen&s;e of Touching, that of Seeing could never
alone &s;ugge&s;t to him the idea of Solidity, or enable him to form
any notion of the external and re&s;i&s;ting &s;ub&s;tance. It is probable,
however, not only that no man, but that no animal was ever born
without the Sen&s;e of Touching, which &s;eems e&s;&s;ential to, and in&s;e|parable
from, the nature of animal life and exi&s;tence. It is un|nece&s;&s;ary,
therefore, to throw away any rea&s;oning, or to hazard
any conjectures, about what might be the effects of what I look
<PB N="219" REF="304">
upon as altogether an impo&s;&s;ible &s;uppo&s;ition. The eye when pre&s;&s;ed
upon by any external and &s;olid &s;ub&s;tance, feels, no doubt, that
pre&s;&s;ure and re&s;i&s;tance, and &s;ugge&s;ts to us (in the &s;ame manner as
every other feeling part of the body) the external and independent
exi&s;tence of that &s;olid &s;ub&s;tance. But in this ca&s;e, the eye acts, not
as the organ of Sight, but as an organ of Touch; for the eye po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es
the Sen&s;e of Touching in common with almo&s;t all the other parts of
the body.</P>
<P>The exten&s;ion, figure, divi&s;ibility, and mobility of Colour, the
&s;ole object of Sight, though, on account of their corre&s;pondence and
connection with the exten&s;ion, figure, divi&s;ibility, and mobility of
Solidity, they are called by the &s;ame name, yet &s;eem to bear no &s;ort
of re&s;emblance to their name&s;akes. As Colour and Solidity bear no
&s;ort of re&s;emblance to one another, &s;o neither can their re&s;pective
modifications. Dr. Berkley very ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, that though we
can conceive either a coloured or a &s;olid line to be prolonged inde|finitely,
yet we cannot conceive the one to be added to the other.
We cannot, even in imagination, conceive an object of Touch to
be prolonged into an object of Sight, or an object of Sight into an
object of Touch. The objects of Sight and tho&s;e of Touch con&s;ti|tute
two worlds, which, though they have a mo&s;t important cor|re&s;pondence
and connection with one another, bear no &s;ort of re|&s;emblance
to one another. The tangible world, as well as all the
different parts which compo&s;e it, has three dimen&s;ions, Length,
Breadth, and Depth. The vi&s;ible world, as well as all the different
parts which compo&s;e it, has only two, Length and Breadth. It
pre&s;ents to us only a plain or &s;urface, which, by certain &s;hades and
combinations of Colour, &s;ugge&s;ts and repre&s;ents to us (in the &s;ame
manner as a picture does) certain tangible objects which have no
Colour, and which therefore can bear no re&s;emblance to tho&s;e &s;hades
and combinations of Colour. Tho&s;e &s;hades and combinations &s;ug|ge&s;t
<PB N="220" REF="305">
tho&s;e different tangible objects as at different di&s;tances, accord|ing
to certain rules of Per&s;pective, which it is, perhaps, not very
ea&s;y to &s;ay how it is that we learn, whether by &s;ome particular in|&s;tinct,
or by &s;ome application of either rea&s;on or experience, which
has become &s;o perfectly habitual to us, that we are &s;carcely &s;en&s;ible
when we make u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>The di&s;tinctne&s;s of this Per&s;pective, the preci&s;ion and accuracy
with which, by means of it, we are capable of judging concerning
the di&s;tance of different tangible objects, is greater or le&s;s, exactly in
proportion as this di&s;tinctne&s;s, as this preci&s;ion and accuracy are of
more or le&s;s importance to us. We can judge of the di&s;tance of
near objects, of the chairs and tables, for example, in the chamber
where we are &s;itting, with the mo&s;t perfect preci&s;ion and accuracy;
and if in broad day-light we ever &s;tumble over any of them, it mu&s;t
be, not from any error in the Sight, but from &s;ome defect in the
attention. The preci&s;ion and accuracy of our judgment concerning
&s;uch near objects are of the utmo&s;t importance to us, and con&s;titute
the great advantage which a man who &s;ees has over one who is unfor|tunately
blind. As the di&s;tance increa&s;es, the di&s;tinctne&s;s of this Per|&s;pective,
the preci&s;ion and accuracy of our judgment gradually di|mini&s;h.
Of the tangible objects which are even at the moderate
di&s;tance of one, two, or three miles from the eye, we are frequently at
a lo&s;s to determine which is neare&s;t, and which remote&s;t. It is &s;eldom
of much importance to us to judge with preci&s;ion concerning the &s;itu|ation
of the tangible objects which are even at this moderate di&s;|tance.
As the di&s;tance increa&s;es, our judgments become more and
more uncertain; and at a very great di&s;tance, &s;uch as that of the
fixed &s;tars, it becomes altogether uncertain. The mo&s;t preci&s;e
knowledge of the relative &s;ituation of &s;uch objects could be of no
other u&s;e to us than to &s;atisfy the mo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary curio&s;ity.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="306">
The di&s;tances at which different men can by Sight di&s;tingui&s;h,
with &s;ome degree of preci&s;ion, the &s;ituation of the tangible objects
which the vi&s;ible ones repre&s;ent, is very different; and this difference,
though it, no doubt, may &s;ometimes depend upon &s;ome difference
in the original configuration of their eyes, yet &s;eems frequently to
ari&s;e altogether from the different cu&s;toms and habits which their
re&s;pective occupations have led them to contract. Men of letters,
who live much in their clo&s;ets, and have &s;eldom occa&s;ion to look at
very di&s;tant objects, are &s;eldom far-&s;ighted. Mariners, on the con|trary,
almo&s;t always are; tho&s;e e&s;pecially who have made many
di&s;tant voyages, in which they have been the greater part of their
time out of &s;ight of land, and have in day-light been con&s;tantly
looking out towards the horizon for the appearance of &s;ome &s;hip, or
of &s;ome di&s;tant &s;hore. It often a&s;toni&s;hes a land-man to ob&s;erve
with what preci&s;ion a &s;ailor can di&s;tingui&s;h in the Offing, not only
the appearance of a &s;hip, which is altogether invi&s;ible to the land|man,
but the number of her ma&s;ts, the direction of her cour&s;e, and
the rate of her &s;ailing. If &s;he is a &s;hip of his acquaintance, he fre|quently
can tell her name, before the land-man has been able to di&s;|cover
even the appearance of a &s;hip.</P>
<P>Vi&s;ible objects, Colour, and all its different modifications, are in
them&s;elves mere &s;hadows or pictures, which &s;eem to float, as it
were, before the organ of Sight. In them&s;elves, and independent
of their connection with the tangible objects which they repre&s;ent,
they are of no importance to us, and can e&s;&s;entially neither benefit
us nor hurt us. Even while we &s;ee them we are &s;eldom thinking
of them. Even when we appear to be looking at them with
the greate&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s, our whole attention is frequently em|ployed,
not upon them, but upon the tangible objects repre&s;ented by
them.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="307">
It is becau&s;e almo&s;t our whole attention is employed, not upon
the vi&s;ible and repre&s;enting, but upon the tangible and repre&s;ented
objects, that in our imaginations we are apt to a&s;cribe to the former
a degree of magnitude which does not belong to them, but which
belongs altogether to the latter. If you &s;hut one eye, and hold im|mediately
before the other a &s;mall circle of plain gla&s;s, of not more
than half an inch in diameter, you may &s;ee through that circle the
mo&s;t exten&s;ive pro&s;pects; lawns and woods, and arms of the &s;ea,
and di&s;tant mountains. You are apt to imagine that the Land&s;cape
which is thus pre&s;ented to you, that the vi&s;ible Picture which you
thus &s;ee, is immen&s;ely great and exten&s;ive. The tangible objects
which this vi&s;ible Picture repre&s;ents, undoubtedly are &s;o. But the
vi&s;ible Picture which repre&s;ents them can be no greater than the little
vi&s;ible circle through which you &s;ee it. If while you are looking
through this circle, you could conceive a fairy hand and a fairy pencil
to come between your eye and the gla&s;s, that pencil could delineate
upon that little gla&s;s the outline of all tho&s;e exten&s;ive lawns and
woods, and arms of the &s;ea, and di&s;tant mountains, in the full and
exact dimen&s;ions with which they are really &s;een by the eye.</P>
<P>Every vi&s;ible object which covers from the eye any other vi&s;ible
object, mu&s;t appear at lea&s;t as large as that other vi&s;ible object. It
mu&s;t occupy at lea&s;t an equal portion of that vi&s;ible plain or &s;urface
which is at that time pre&s;ented to the eye. Opticians accordingly
tell us, that all the vi&s;ible objects which are &s;een under equal angles
mu&s;t to the eye appear equally large. But the vi&s;ible object, which
covers from the eye any other vi&s;ible object, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be
&s;een under angles at lea&s;t equally large as tho&s;e under which that
other object is &s;een. When I hold up my finger, however, before
my eye, it appears to cover the greater part of the vi&s;ible chamber
in which I am &s;itting. It &s;hould therefore appear as large as the
<PB N="223" REF="308">
greater part of that vi&s;ible chamber. But becau&s;e I know that the
tangible finger bears but a very &s;mall proportion to the greater part
of the tangible chamber, I am apt to fancy that the vi&s;ible finger
bears but a like proportion to the greater part of the vi&s;ible chamber.
My judgment corrects my eye-&s;ight, and, in my fancy, reduces
the vi&s;ible object, which repre&s;ents the little tangible one, below its
real vi&s;ible dimen&s;ions; and, on the contrary, it augments the vi&s;ible
object which repre&s;ents the great tangible one a good deal beyond
tho&s;e dimen&s;ions. My attention being generally altogether occupied
about the tangible and repre&s;ented, and not at all about the vi&s;ible
and repre&s;enting objects, my carele&s;s fancy be&s;tows upon the latter
a proportion which does not in the lea&s;t belong to them, but which
belongs altogether to the former.</P>
<P>It is becau&s;e the vi&s;ible object which covers any other vi&s;ible ob|ject
mu&s;t always appear at lea&s;t as large as that other object, that
Opticians tell us that the &s;phere of our vi&s;ion appears to the eye al|ways
equally large; and that when we hold our hand before our
eye in &s;uch a manner that we &s;ee nothing but the in&s;ide of the hand,
we &s;till &s;ee preci&s;ely the &s;ame number of vi&s;ible points, the &s;phere
of our vi&s;ion is &s;till as completely filled, the retina is as entirely
covered with the object which is thus pre&s;ented to it, as when we
&s;urvey the mo&s;t exten&s;ive horizon.</P>
<P>A young gentleman who was born with a cataract upon each of his
eyes was, in one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and twenty-eight, couched
by Mr. Che&s;elden, and by that means for the fir&s;t time made to &s;ee
di&s;tinctly. &startq;At fir&s;t, &s;ays the operator, he could bear but very
little Sight, and the things he &s;aw he thought extremely large;
but upon &s;eeing things larger, tho&s;e fir&s;t &s;een he conceived le&s;s,
never being able to imagine any lines beyond the bounds he &s;aw;
the room he was in, he &s;aid, he knew to be but part of the hou&s;e,
<PB N="224" REF="309">
&startq;yet he could not conceive that the whole hou&s;e would look
bigger.&endq; It was unavoidable that he &s;hould at fir&s;t conceive, that
no vi&s;ible object could be greater, could pre&s;ent to his eye a greater
number of vi&s;ible points, or could more completely fill the compre|hen&s;ion
of that organ, than the narrowe&s;t &s;phere of his vi&s;ion. And
when that &s;phere came to be enlarged, he &s;till could not conceive
that the vi&s;ible objects which it pre&s;ented could be larger than tho&s;e
which he had fir&s;t &s;een. He mu&s;t probably by this time have been
in &s;ome degree habituated to the connection between vi&s;ible and
tangible objects, and enabled to conceive that vi&s;ible object to be
&s;mall which repre&s;ented a &s;mall tangible object; and that to be great,
which repre&s;ented a great one. The great objects did not appear
to his Sight greater than the &s;mall ones had done before; but the
&s;mall ones, which, having filled the whole &s;phere of his vi&s;ion, had
before appeared as large as po&s;&s;ible, being now known to repre&s;ent
much &s;maller tangible objects, &s;eemed in his conception to grow
&s;maller. He had begun now to employ his attention more about
the tangible and repre&s;ented, than about the vi&s;ible and repre&s;enting
objects; and he was beginning to a&s;cribe to the latter, the proportions
and dimen&s;ions which properly belonged altogether to the former.</P>
<P>As we frequently a&s;cribe to the objects of Sight a magnitude and
proportion which does not really belong to them, but to the objects
of Touch which they repre&s;ent, &s;o we likewi&s;e a&s;cribe to them a
&s;teadine&s;s of appearance, which as little belongs to them, but which
they derive altogether from their connection with the &s;ame objects of
Touch. The chair which now &s;tands at the farther end of the room,
I am apt to imagine, appears to my eye as large as it did when it
&s;lood clo&s;e by me, when it was &s;een under angles at lea&s;t four times
larger than tho&s;e under which it is &s;een at pre&s;ent, and when it mu&s;t
have occupied, at lea&s;t, &s;ixteen times that portion which it occupies
at pre&s;ent, of the vi&s;ible plain or &s;urface which is now before my
<PB N="225" REF="310">
eyes. But as I know that the magnitude of the tangible and repre|&s;ented
chair, the principal object of my attention, is the &s;ame in
both &s;ituations, I a&s;cribe to the vi&s;ible and repre&s;enting chair (though
now reduced to le&s;s than the &s;ixteenth part of its former dimen|&s;ions)
a &s;teadine&s;s of appearance, which certainly belongs not in
any re&s;pect to it, but altogether to the tangible and repre&s;ented one.
As we approach to, or retire from, the tangible object which any
vi&s;ible one repre&s;ents, the vi&s;ible object gradually augments in the
one ca&s;e, and dimini&s;hes in the other. To &s;peak accurately, it is
not the &s;ame vi&s;ible object which we &s;ee at different di&s;tances, but a
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of vi&s;ible objects, which, though they all re&s;emble one
another, tho&s;e e&s;pecially which follow near after one another; yet
are all really different and di&s;tinct. But as we know that the
tangible object which they repre&s;ent remains always the &s;ame, we
a&s;cribe to them too a &s;amene&s;s which belongs altogether to it: and
we fancy that we &s;ee the &s;ame tree at a mile, at half a mile, and at
a few yards di&s;tance. At tho&s;e different di&s;tances, however, the
vi&s;ible objects are &s;o very widely different, that we are &s;en&s;ible of a
change in their appearance. But &s;till, as the tangible object which
they repre&s;ent remains invariably the &s;ame, we a&s;cribe a &s;ort of
&s;amene&s;s even to them too.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that no man ever &s;aw the &s;ame vi&s;ible object
twice; and this, though, no doubt, an exaggeration, is, in reality,
much le&s;s &s;o than at fir&s;t view it appears to be. Though I am apt
to fancy that all the chairs and tables, and other little pieces of fur|$iture
in the room where I am &s;itting, appear to my eye always the
&s;ame, yet their appearance is in reality continually varying, not
only according to every variation in their &s;ituation and di&s;tance
with regard to where I am &s;itting, but according to every, even the
mo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible variation in the altitude of my body, in the move|ment
of my head, or even in that of my eyes. The per&s;pective
<PB N="226" REF="311">
nece&s;&s;arily varies according to all, even the &s;malle&s;t of the&s;e varia|tions;
and con&s;equently the appearance of the objects which that
per&s;pective pre&s;ents to me. Ob&s;erve what difficulty a portrait painter
finds, in getting the per&s;on who &s;its for his picture to pre&s;ent to him
preci&s;ely that view of the countenance from which the fir&s;t outline
was drawn. The painter is &s;carce ever completely &s;atisfied with the
&s;ituation of the face which is pre&s;ented to him, and finds that it is
&s;carcely ever preci&s;ely the &s;ame with that from which he rapidly
&s;ketched the fir&s;t outline. He endeavours, as well as he can, to
correct the difference from memory, from fancy, and from a &s;ort of
art of approximation, by which he &s;trives to expre&s;s as nearly as
he can, the ordinary effect of the look, air, and character of the
per&s;on who&s;e picture he is drawing. The per&s;on who draws from
a &s;tatue, which is altogether immoveable, feels a difficulty, though,
no doubt, in a le&s;s degree, of the &s;ame kind. It ari&s;es altogether
from the difficulty which he finds in placing his own eye preci&s;ely in
the &s;ame &s;ituation during the whole time which he employs in
completing his drawing. This difficulty is more than doubled upon
the painter who draws from a living &s;ubject. The &s;tatue never is
the cau&s;e of any variation or un&s;teadine&s;s in its own appearance.
The living &s;ubject frequently is.</P>
<P>The benevolent purpo&s;e of nature in be&s;towing upon us the &s;en&s;e
of &s;eeing, is evidently to inform us concerning the &s;ituation and
di&s;tance of the tangible objects which &s;urround us. Upon the
knowledge of this di&s;tance and &s;ituation depends the whole conduct
of human life, in the mo&s;t trifling as well as in the mo&s;t important
tran&s;actions. Even animal motion depends upon it; and without
it we could neither move, nor even &s;it &s;till, with complete &s;ecurity.
The objects of &s;ight, as Dr. Berkley &s;inely ob&s;erves, con&s;titute a
&s;ort of language which the Author of Nature addre&s;&s;es to our eyes,
and by which he informs us of many things, which it is of the
<PB N="227" REF="312">
utmo&s;t importance to us to know. As, in common language, the
words or &s;ounds bear no re&s;emblance to the things which they de|note,
&s;o, in this other language, the vi&s;ible objects bear no &s;ort of
re&s;emblance to the tangible object which they repre&s;ent, and of
who&s;e relative &s;ituation, with regard both to our&s;elves and to one
another, they inform us.</P>
<P>He acknowledges, however, that though &s;carcely any word be by
nature better fitted to expre&s;s one meaning than any other meaning,
yet that certain vi&s;ible objects are better fitted than others to repre|&s;ent
certain tangible objects. A vi&s;ible &s;quare, for example, is bet|ter
fitted than a vi&s;ible circle to repre&s;ent a tangible &s;quare. There
is, perhaps, &s;trictly &s;peaking, no &s;uch thing as either a vi&s;ible cube,
or a vi&s;ible globe, the objects of &s;ight being all naturally pre&s;ented
to the eye as upon one &s;urface. But &s;till there are certain combina|tions
of colours which are fitted to repre&s;ent to the eye, both the
near and the di&s;tant, both the advancing and the receding lines,
angles, and &s;urfaces of the tangible cube; and there are others fitted
to repre&s;ent, in the &s;ame manner, both the near and the receding
&s;urface of the tangible globe. The combination which repre&s;ents
the tangible cube, would not be fit to repre&s;ent the tangible globe;
and that which repre&s;ents the tangible globe, would not be fit to
repre&s;ent the tangible cube. Though there may, therefore, be no
re&s;emblance between vi&s;ible and tangible objects, there &s;eems to be
&s;ome affinity or corre&s;pondence between them &s;ufficient to make
each vi&s;ible object fitter to repre&s;ent a certain preci&s;e tangible object
than any other tangible object. But the greater part of words &s;eem
to have no &s;ort of af&s;inity or corre&s;pondence with the meanings or
ideas which they expre&s;s; and if cu&s;tom had &s;o ordered it, they
might with equal propriety have been made u&s;e of to expre&s;s any
other meanings or ideas.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="313">
Dr. Berkley, with that happine&s;s of illu&s;tration which &s;carcely ever
de&s;erts him, remarks, that this in reality is no more than what hap|pens
in common language; and that though letters bear no &s;ort of
re&s;emblance to the words which they denote, yet that the &s;ame com|bination
of letters which repre&s;ents one word, would not always be
&s;it to repre&s;ent another; and that each word is always be&s;t repre|&s;ented
by its own proper combination of letters. The compari&s;on,
however, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, is here totally changed. The con|nection
between vi&s;ible and tangible objects was fir&s;t illu&s;trated by
comparing it with, that between &s;poken language and the meanings
or ideas which &s;poken language &s;ugge&s;ts to us; and it is now illu&s;|trated
by the connection between written language and &s;poken lan|guage,
which is altogether different. Even this &s;econd illu&s;tration,
be&s;ides, will not apply perfectly to the ca&s;e. When cu&s;tom, indeed,
has perfectly a&s;certained the powers of each letter; when it has
a&s;certained, for example, that the fir&s;t letter of the alphabet &s;hall
always repre&s;ent &s;uch a &s;ound, and the &s;econd letter &s;uch another
&s;ound; each word comes then to be more properly repre&s;ented by
one certain combination of written letters or characters, than it
could be by any other combination. But &s;till the characters them|&s;elves
are altogether arbitrary, and have no &s;ort of affinity or cor|re&s;pondence
with the articulate &s;ounds which they denote. The
character which marks the fir&s;t letter of the alphabet, for example,
if cu&s;tom had &s;o ordered it, might, with perfect propriety, have
been made u&s;e of to expre&s;s the &s;ound which we now annex to the
&s;econd, and the character of the &s;econd to expre&s;s that which we now
annex to the fir&s;t. But the vi&s;ible characters which repre&s;ent to our
eyes the tangible globe, could not &s;o well repre&s;ent the tangible
cube; nor could tho&s;e which repre&s;ent the tangible cube, &s;o pro|perly
repre&s;ent the tangible globe. There is evidently, therefore, a
certain affinity and corre&s;pondence between each vi&s;ible object and
<PB N="229" REF="314">
the preci&s;e tangible object repre&s;ented by it, much &s;uperior to what
takes place either between written and &s;poken language, or between
&s;poken language and the ideas or meanings which it &s;ugge&s;ts. The
language which nature addre&s;&s;es to our eyes, has evidently a fitne&s;s
of repre&s;entation, an aptitude for &s;ignifying the preci&s;e things which
it denotes, much &s;uperior to that of any of the artificial languages
which human art and ingenuity have ever been able to invent.</P>
<P>That this affinity and corre&s;pondence, however, between vi&s;ible
and tangible objects could not alone, and without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
ob&s;ervation and experience, teach us, by any effort of rea&s;on, to
infer what was the preci&s;e tangible object which each vi&s;ible one
repre&s;ented, if it is not &s;ufficiently evident from what has been
already &s;aid, it mu&s;t be completely &s;o from the remarks of Mr.
Che&s;elden upon the young gentleman above-mentioned, whom he
had couched for a cataract. &startq;Though we &s;ay of this gentleman,
that he was blind,&endq; ob&s;erves Mr. Che&s;elden, &startq;as we do of all
people who have ripe cataracts; yet they are never &s;o blind from
that cau&s;e but that they can di&s;cern day from night; and for the
mo&s;t part, in a &s;trong light, di&s;tingui&s;h black, white, and &s;carlet;
but they cannot perceive the &s;hape of any thing; for the light by
which the&s;e perceptions are made, being let in obliquely through
the aqueous humour, or the anterior &s;urface of the cry&s;talline,
(by which the rays cannot be brought into a focus upon the
retina,) they can di&s;cern in no other manner than a found eye
can through a gla&s;s of broken jelly, where a great variety of &s;ur|faces
&s;o differently refract the light, that the &s;everal di&s;tinct pen|cils
of rays cannot be collected by the eye into their proper foci;
wherefore the &s;hape of an object in &s;uch a ca&s;e cannot be at all
di&s;cerned, though the colour may: and thus it was with this
young gentleman, who, though he knew tho&s;e colours a&s;under in
a good light, yet when he &s;aw them after he was couched, the
<PB N="230" REF="315">
faint ideas he had of them before were not &s;ufficient for him to
know them by afterwards; and therefore he did not think them
the &s;ame which he had before known by tho&s;e names.&endq; This
young gentleman, therefore, had &s;ome advantage over one who
from a &s;tate of total blindne&s;s had been made for the fir&s;t time to
&s;ee. He had &s;ome imperfect notion of the di&s;tinction of colours;
and he mu&s;t have known that tho&s;e colours had &s;ome &s;ort of con|nection
with the tangible objects which he had been accu&s;tomed to
feel. But had he emerged from total blindne&s;s, he could have learnt
this connection only from a very long cour&s;e of ob&s;ervation and
experience. How little this advantage availed him, however, we
may learn partly from the pa&s;&s;ages of Mr. Che&s;elden's narrative, al|ready
quoted, and &s;till more from the following:</P>
<P>&startq;When he fir&s;t &s;aw,&endq; &s;ays that ingenious operator, &startq;he was &s;o
far from making any judgment about di&s;tances, that he thought
all objects whatever touched his eyes (as he expre&s;&s;ed it) as what
he felt did his &s;kin; and thought no objects &s;o agreeable as tho&s;e
which were &s;mooth and regular, though he could form no judg|ment
of their &s;hape, or gue&s;s what it was in any object that was
plea&s;ing to him. He knew not the &s;hape of any thing, nor any
one thing from another, however different in &s;hape or magni|tude;
but upon being told what things were, who&s;e form he be|fore
knew from feeling, he would carefully ob&s;erve, that he might
know them again; but having too many objects to learn at once,
he forgot many of them; and (as he &s;aid) at fir&s;t learned to
know, and again forgot a thou&s;and things in a day. One parti|cular
only (though it may appear trifling) I will relate: Having
often forgot which was the cat, and which the dog, he was
a&s;hamed to a&s;k; but catching the cat (which he knew by feeling)
he was ob&s;erved to look at her &s;tedfa&s;tly, and then &s;etting her
down, &s;aid, So, pu&s;s! I &s;hall know you another time.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="316">
When the young gentleman &s;aid, that the objects which he &s;aw
touched his eyes, he certainly could not mean that they pre&s;&s;ed upon
or re&s;i&s;ted his eyes; for the objects of &s;ight never act upon the organ
in any way that refembles pre&s;&s;ure or re&s;i&s;tance. He could mean
no more than that they were clo&s;e upon his eyes, or, to &s;peak more
properly, perhaps, that they were in his eyes. A deaf man, who
was made all at once to hear, might in the &s;ame manner naturally
enough &s;ay, that the &s;ounds which he heard touched his ears, mean|ing
that he felt them as clo&s;e upon his ears, or, to &s;peak, perhaps,
more properly, as in his ears.</P>
<P>Mr. Che&s;elden adds afterwards: &startq;We thought he &s;oon knew
what pictures repre&s;ented which were &s;hewed to him, but we
found afterwards we were mi&s;taken; for about two months after
he was couched, he di&s;covered at once they repre&s;ented &s;olid
bodies, when, to that time, he con&s;idered them only as party|coloured
planes, or &s;urfaces diver&s;ified with variety of paints;
but even then he was no le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed, expecting the pictures
would feel like the things they repre&s;ented, and was amazed when
he found tho&s;e parts, which by their light and &s;hadow appeared
now round and uneven, felt only flat like the re&s;t; and a&s;ked
which was the lying &s;en&s;e, feeling or &s;eeing?&endq;</P>
<P>Painting, though, by combinations of light and &s;hade, &s;imilar to
tho&s;e which Nature makes u&s;e of in the vi&s;ible objects which &s;he
pre&s;ents to our eyes, it endeavours to imitate tho&s;e objects; yet it
never has been able to equal the per&s;pective of Nature, or to give
to its productions that force and di&s;tinctne&s;s of relief and projection
which Nature be&s;tows upon hers. When the young gentleman was
ju&s;t beginning to under&s;tand the &s;trong and di&s;tinct per&s;pective of
Nature, the faint and feeble per&s;pective of Painting made no im|pre&s;&s;ion
upon him, and the picture appeared to him what it really
<PB N="232" REF="317">
was, a plain &s;urface bedaubed with different colours. When he be|came
more familiar with the per&s;pective of Nature, the inferiority of
that of Painting did not hinder him from di&s;covering its re&s;emblance
to that of Nature. In the per&s;pective of Nature, he had always
found that the &s;ituation and di&s;tance of the tangible and repre&s;ented
objects, corre&s;ponded exactly to what the vi&s;ible and repre&s;enting ones
&s;ugge&s;ted to him. He expected to find the &s;ame thing in the &s;imilar,
though inferior per&s;pective of Painting, and was di&s;appointed when
he found that the vi&s;ble and tangible objects had not, in this ca&s;e,
their u&s;ual corre&s;pondence.</P>
<P>&startq;In a year after &s;eeing,&endq; adds Mr. Che&s;elden, &startq;the young gen|tleman
being carried upon Ep&s;om-downs, and ob&s;erving a large
pro&s;pect, he was exceedingly delighted with it, and called it a
new kind of &s;eeing.&endq; He had now, it is evident, come to under|&s;tand
completely the language of Vi&s;ion. The vi&s;ible objects which
this noble pro&s;pect pre&s;ented to him did not now appear as touching,
or as clo&s;e upon his eye. They did not now appear of the &s;ame
magnitude with tho&s;e &s;mall objects to which, for &s;ome time after
the operation, he had been accu&s;tomed, in the little chamber where
he was confined. Tho&s;e new vi&s;ible objects at once, and as it were
of their own accord, a&s;&s;umed both the di&s;tance and the magnitude
of the great tangible objects which they repre&s;ented. He had now,
therefore, it would &s;eem, become completely ma&s;ter of the language
of Vi&s;ion, and he had become &s;o in the cour&s;e of a year; a much
&s;horter period than that in which any per&s;on, arrived at the age of
manhood, could completely acquire any foreign language. It would
appear too, that he had made very con&s;iderable progre&s;s even in the
two fir&s;t months. He began at that early period to under&s;tand even
the feeble per&s;pective of Painting; and though at fir&s;t he could not
di&s;tingui&s;h it from the &s;trong per&s;pective of Nature, yet he could not
have been thus impo&s;ed upon by &s;o imperfect an imitation, if the
<PB N="233" REF="318">
great principles of Vi&s;ion had not beforehand been deeply impre&s;&s;ed
upon his mind, and if he had not, either by the a&s;&s;ociation of
ideas, or by &s;ome other unknown principle, been &s;trongly deter|mined
to expect certain tangible objects in con&s;equence of the
vi&s;ible ones which had been pre&s;ented to him. This rapid progre&s;s,
however, may, perhaps, be accounted for from that fitne&s;s of re|pre&s;entation,
which has already been taken notice of, between vi&s;ible
and tangible objects. In this language of Nature, it may be &s;aid,
the analogies are more perfect; the etymologies, the declen&s;ions,
and conjugations, if one may &s;ay &s;o, are more regular than tho&s;e
of any human language. The rules are fewer, and tho&s;e rules ad|mit
of no exceptions.</P>
<P>But though it may have been altogether by the &s;low paces of ob|&s;ervation
and experience that this young gentleman acquired the
knowledge of the connection between vi&s;ible and tangible objects;
we cannot from thence with certainty infer, that young children
have not &s;ome in&s;tinctive perception of the &s;ame kind. In him this
in&s;tinctive power, not having been exerted at the proper &s;ea&s;on, may,
from di&s;u&s;e, have gone gradually to decay, and at la&s;t have been
completely obliterated. Or, perhaps, (what &s;eems likewi&s;e very
po&s;&s;ible,) &s;ome feeble and unob&s;erved remains of it may have &s;ome|what
facilitated his acqui&s;ition of what he might otherwi&s;e have
found it much more difficult to acquire.</P>
<P>That, antecedent to all experience, the young of at lea&s;t the
greater part of animals po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome in&s;tinctive perception of this
kind, &s;eems abundantly evident. The hen never feeds her young
by dropping the food into their bills, as the linnet and the thru&s;h
feed theirs. Almo&s;t as &s;oon as her chickens are hatched, &s;he does
not feed them, but carries them to the field to feed, where they
<PB N="234" REF="319">
walk about at their ea&s;e, it would &s;eem, and appear to have the mo&s;t
di&s;tinct perception of all the tangible objects which &s;urround them.
We may often &s;ee them, accordingly, by the &s;traighte&s;t road, run
to and pick up any little grains which &s;he &s;hews them, even at the
di&s;tance of &s;everal yards; and they no &s;ooner come into the light
than they &s;eem to under&s;tand this language of Vi&s;ion as well as they
ever do afterwards. The young of the partridge and of the grou&s;e
&s;eem to have, at the &s;ame early period, the mo&s;t di&s;tinct perceptions
of the &s;ame kind. The young partridge, almo&s;t as &s;oon it comes
from the &s;hell, runs about among long gra&s;s and corn; the young
grou&s;e among long heath, and would both mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially hurt
them&s;elves if they had not the mo&s;t acute, as well as di&s;tinct per|ception
of the tangible objects which not only &s;urround them but
pre&s;s upon them on all &s;ides. This is the ca&s;e too with the young
of the goo&s;e, of the duck, and, &s;o far as I have been able to ob&s;erve,
with tho&s;e of at lea&s;t the greater part of the birds which make their
ne&s;ts upon the ground, with the greater part of tho&s;e which are
ranked by Linnaeus in the orders of the hen and the goo&s;e, and of
many of tho&s;e long-&s;hanked and wading birds which he places in
the order that he di&s;tingui&s;hes by the name of Grallae.</P>
<P>The young of tho&s;e birds that build their ne&s;ts in bu&s;hes, upon
trees, in the holes and crevices of high walls, upon high rocks and
precipices, and other places of difficult acce&s;s; of the greater part
of tho&s;e ranked by Linnaeus in the orders of the hawk, the magpie,
and the &s;parrow, &s;eem to come blind from the &s;hell, and to con|tinue
&s;o for at lea&s;t &s;ome days thereafter. Till they are able to fly
they are fed by the joint labour of both parents. As &s;oon as that
period arrives, however, and probably for &s;ome time before, they
evidently enjoy all the powers of Vi&s;ion in the mo&s;t complete per|fection,
and can di&s;tingui&s;h with mo&s;t exact preci&s;ion the &s;hape and
<PB N="235" REF="320">
proportion of the tangible objects which every vi&s;ible one repre&s;ents.
In &s;o &s;hort a period they cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to have acquired tho&s;e
powers from experience, and mu&s;t therefore derive them from &s;ome
in&s;tinctive &s;ugge&s;tion. The &s;ight of birds &s;eems to be both more
prompt and more acute than that of any other animals. Without
hurting them&s;elves they dart into the thicke&s;t and mo&s;t thorny
bu&s;hes, fly with the utmo&s;t rapidity through the mo&s;t intricate fo|re&s;ts,
and while they are &s;oaring aloft in the air, di&s;cover upon the
ground the little in&s;ects and grains upon which they feed.</P>
<P>The young of &s;everal &s;orts of quadrupeds &s;eem, like tho&s;e of the
greater part of birds which make their ne&s;ts upon the ground, to
enjoy as &s;oon as they come into the world the faculty of &s;eeing as
completely as they ever do afterwards. The day, or the day after
they are dropt, the calf follows the cow, and the foal the mare, to
the field; and though from timidity they &s;eldom remove far from
the mother, yet they &s;eem to walk about at their ea&s;e; which they
could not do unle&s;s they could di&s;tingui&s;h, with &s;ome degree of pre|ci&s;ion,
the &s;hape and proportion of the tangible objects which each
vi&s;ible one repre&s;ents. The degree of preci&s;ion, however, with
which the hor&s;e is capable of making this di&s;tinction, &s;eems at no
period of his life to be very complete. He is at all times apt to
&s;tartle at many vi&s;ible objects, which, if they di&s;tinctly &s;ugge&s;ted to
him the real &s;hape and proportion of the tangible objects which they
repre&s;ent, could not be the objects of fear; at the trunk or root of
an old tree, for example, which happens to be laid by the road &s;ide,
at a great &s;tone, or the fragment of a rock which happens to lie near
the way where he is going. To reconcile him, even to a &s;ingle ob|ject
of this kind, which has once alarmed him, frequently requires
&s;ome &s;kill, as well as much patience and good temper, in the rider.
Such powers of &s;ight, however, as Nature has thought proper to
<PB N="236" REF="321">
render him capable of acquiring, he &s;eems to enjoy from the begin|ning,
in as great perfection as he ever does afterwards.</P>
<P>The young of other quadrupeds, like tho&s;e of the birds which
make their ne&s;ts in places of difficult acce&s;s, come blind into the
world. Their &s;ight, however, &s;oon opens, and as &s;oon as it does &s;o,
they &s;eem to enjoy it in the mo&s;t complete perfection, as we may
all ob&s;erve in the puppy and the kitten. The &s;ame thing, I believe,
may be &s;aid of all other bea&s;ts of prey, at lea&s;t of all tho&s;e concern|ing
which I have been able to collect any di&s;tinct information.
They come blind into the world; but as &s;oon as their &s;ight opens,
they appear to enjoy it in the mo&s;t complete perfection.</P>
<P>It &s;eems difficult to &s;uppo&s;e that man is the only animal of which
the young are not endowed with &s;ome in&s;tinctive perception of this
kind. The young of the human &s;pecies, however, continue &s;o long
in a &s;tate of entire dependency, they mu&s;t be &s;o long carried about
in the arms of their mothers or of their nur&s;es, that &s;uch an in&s;tinc|tive
perception may &s;eem le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to them than to any other
race of animals. Before it could be of any u&s;e to them, ob&s;ervation
and experience may, by the known principle of the a&s;&s;ociation of
ideas, have &s;ufficiently connected in their young minds each vi&s;ible
object with the corre&s;ponding tangible one which it is fitted to re|pre&s;ent.
Nature, it may be &s;aid, never be&s;tows upon any animal
any faculty which is not either nece&s;&s;ary or u&s;eful, and an in&s;tinct of
this kind would be altogether u&s;ele&s;s to an animal which mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily
acquire the knowledge which the in&s;tinct is given to &s;upply,
long before that in&s;tinct could be of any u&s;e to it. Children, how|ever,
appear at &s;o very early a period to know the di&s;tance, the
&s;hape, and magnitude of the different tangible objects which are
pre&s;ented to them, that I am di&s;po&s;ed to believe that even they may
<PB N="237" REF="322">
have &s;ome in&s;tinctive perception of this kind; though po&s;&s;ibly in a
much weaker degree than the greater part of other animals. A
child that is &s;carcely a month old, &s;tretches out its hands to feel any
little play-thing that is pre&s;ented to it. It di&s;tingui&s;hes its nur&s;e,
and the other people who are much about it, from &s;trangers. It
clings to the former, and turns away from the latter. Hold a &s;mall
looking-gla&s;s before a child of not more than two or three months
old, and it will &s;tretch out its little arms behind the gla&s;s, in order
to feel the child which it &s;ees, and which it imagines is at the back
of the gla&s;s. It is deceived, no doubt; but even this &s;ort of decep|tion
&s;ufficiently demon&s;trates that it has a tolerably di&s;tinct appre|hen&s;ion
of the ordinary per&s;pective of Vi&s;ion, which it cannot well
have learnt from ob&s;ervation and experience.</P>
<P>Do any of our other &s;en&s;es, antecedently to &s;uch ob&s;ervation and
experience, in&s;tinctively &s;ugge&s;t to us &s;ome conception of the &s;olid and
re&s;i&s;ting &s;ub&s;tances which excite their re&s;pective &s;en&s;ations; though
the&s;e &s;en&s;ations bear no &s;ort of re&s;emblance to tho&s;e &s;ub&s;tances?</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;e of Ta&s;ting certainly does not. Before we can feel the
&s;en&s;ation, the &s;olid and re&s;i&s;ting &s;ub&s;tance which excites it mu&s;t be
pre&s;&s;ed again&s;t the organs of Ta&s;te, and mu&s;t con&s;equently be per|ceived
by them. Antecedently to ob&s;ervation and experience, there|fore,
the &s;en&s;e of Ta&s;ting can never be &s;aid in&s;tinctively to &s;ugge&s;t
&s;ome conception of that &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>It may, perhaps, be otherwi&s;e with the &s;en&s;e of Smelling. The
young of all &s;uckling animals, (of the Mammalia of Linnaeus,) whe|ther
they are born with &s;ight or without it, yet as &s;oon as they come
into the world apply to the nipple of the mother in order to &s;uck.
In doing this they are evidently directed by the Smell. The Smell
appears either to excite the appetite for the proper food, or at lea&s;t
<PB N="238" REF="323">
to direct the new-born animal to the place where that food is to be
found. It may perhaps do both the one and the other.</P>
<P>That when the &s;tomach is empty, the Smell of agreeable food
excites and irritates the appetite, is what we all mu&s;t have frequently
experienced. But the &s;tomach of every new-born animal is nece&s;|&s;arily
empty. While in the womb it is nouri&s;hed, not by the mouth,
but by the navel-&s;tring. Children have been born apparently in the
mo&s;t perfect health and vigour, and have applied to &s;uck in the
u&s;ual manner; but immediately, or &s;oon after, have thrown up the
milk, and in the cour&s;e of a few hours have died vomiting and in
convul&s;ions. Upon opening their bodies it has been found that the
inte&s;tinal tube or canal had never been opened or pierced in the
whole extent of its length; but, like a &s;ack, admitted of no pa&s;&s;age
beyond a particular place. It could not have been in any re&s;pect by
the mouth, therefore, but altogether by the navel-&s;tring, that &s;uch
children had been nouri&s;hed and fed up to the degree of health and
vigour in which they were born. Every animal, while in the
womb, &s;eems to draw its nouri&s;hment, more like a vegetable, from
the root, than like an animal from the mouth; and that nouri&s;h|ment
&s;eems to be conveyed to all the different parts of the body by
tubes and canals in many re&s;pects different from tho&s;e which after|wards
perform the &s;ame function. As &s;oon as it comes into the
world, this new &s;et of tubes and canals, which the providential care
of Nature had for a long time before been gradually preparing, is all
at once and in&s;tantaneou&s;ly opened. They are all empty, and they
require to be filled. An unea&s;y &s;en&s;ation accompanies the one &s;itua|tion,
and an agreeable one the other. The &s;mell of the &s;ub&s;tance
which is fitted for filling them, increa&s;es and irritates that unea&s;y
&s;en&s;ation, and produces hunger, or the appetite for food.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="324">
But all the appetites which take their origin from a certain &s;tate
of the body, &s;eem to &s;ugge&s;t the means of their own gratification;
and, even long before experience, &s;ome anticipation or preconcep|tion
of the plea&s;ure which attends that gratification. In the appe|tite
for &s;ex, which frequently, I am di&s;po&s;ed to believe almo&s;t
always, comes a long time before the age of puberty, this is per|fectly
and di&s;tinctly evident. The appetite for food &s;ugge&s;ts to the
new-born infant the operation of &s;ucking, the only means by which
it can po&s;&s;ibly gratify that appetite. It is continually &s;ucking. It
&s;ucks whatever is pre&s;ented to its mouth. It &s;ucks even when there
is nothing pre&s;ented to its mouth, and &s;ome anticipation or precon|ception
of the plea&s;ure which it is to enjoy in &s;ucking, &s;eems to
make it delight in putting its mouth into the &s;hape and configura|tion
by which it alone can enjoy that plea&s;ure. There are other
appetites in which the mo&s;t unexperienced imagination produces a
&s;imilar effect upon the organs which Nature has provided for their
gratification.</P>
<P>The Smell not only excites the appetite, but directs to the object
which can alone gratify that appetite. But by &s;ugge&s;ting the direc|tion
towards that object, the Smell mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome no|tion
of di&s;tance and externality, which are nece&s;&s;arily involved in
the idea of direction; in the idea of the line of motion by which
the di&s;tance can be&s;t be overcome, and the mouth brought into con|tact
with the unknown &s;ub&s;tance which is the object of the appetite.
That the Smell &s;hould alone &s;ugge&s;t any preconception of the &s;hape
or magnitude of the external body to which it directs, &s;eems not
very probable. The &s;en&s;ation of Smell &s;eems to have no &s;ort of
affinity or corre&s;pondence with &s;hape or magnitude; and whatever
preconception the infant may have of the&s;e, (and it may very pro|bably
have &s;ome &s;uch preconception,) is likely to be &s;ugge&s;ted, not
<PB N="240" REF="325">
&s;o much directly by the Smell, and indirectly by the appetite excited
by that Smell; as by the principle which teaches the child to mould
its mouth into the conformation and action of &s;ucking, even before it
reaches the object to which alone that conformation and action can
be u&s;efully applied.</P>
<P>The Smell, however, as it &s;ugge&s;ts the direction by which the
external body mu&s;t be approached, mu&s;t &s;ugge&s;t at lea&s;t &s;ome vague
idea or preconception of the exi&s;tence of that body; of the thing
to which it directs, though not perhaps of the preci&s;e &s;hape and
magnitude of that thing. The infant, too, feeling its mouth at|tracted
and drawn as it were towards that external body, mu&s;t con|ceive
the Smell which thus draws and attracts it, as &s;omething be|longing
to or proceeding from that body, or what is afterwards de|nominated
and ob&s;curely under&s;tood to be as a &s;ort of quality or
attribute of that body.</P>
<P>The Smell, too, may very probably &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome even tolerably
di&s;tinct perception of the Ta&s;te of the food to which it directs. The
re&s;pective objects of our different external &s;en&s;es &s;eem, indeed, the
greater part of them, to bear no &s;ort of re&s;emblance to one ano|ther.
Colour bears no &s;ort of re&s;emblance to Solidity, nor to
Heat, nor to Cold, nor to Sound, nor to Smell, nor to Ta&s;te.
To this general rule, however, there &s;eems to be one, and per|haps
but one exception. The &s;en&s;ations of Smell and Ta&s;te &s;eem
evidently to bear &s;ome &s;ort of re&s;emblance to one another. Smell
appears to have been given to us by Nature as the director of Ta&s;te.
It announces, as it were, before trial, what is likely to be the Ta&s;te
of the food which is &s;et before us. Though perceived by a differ|ent
organ, it &s;eems in many ca&s;es to be but a weaker &s;en&s;ation
nearly of the &s;ame kind with that of the Ta&s;te which that announces.
It is very natural to &s;uppo&s;e, therefore, that the Smell may &s;ugge&s;t
<PB N="241" REF="326">
to the infant &s;ome tolerably di&s;tinct preconception of the Ta&s;te of the
food which it announces, and may, even before experience, make
its mouth, as we &s;ay, water for that food.</P>
<P>That numerous divi&s;ion of animals which Linnaeus ranks under
the cla&s;s of <HI>worms,</HI> have, &s;carcely any of them, any head. They
neither &s;ee nor hear, have neither eyes nor ears; but many of
them have the power of &s;elf-motion, and appear to move about
in &s;earch of their food. They can be directed in this &s;earch by no
other &s;en&s;e than that of Smelling. The mo&s;t accurate micro&s;copical
ob&s;ervations, however, have never been able to di&s;cover in &s;uch
animals any di&s;tinct organ of Smell. They have a mouth and a &s;to|mach,
but no no&s;trils. The organ of Ta&s;te, it is probable, has in
them a &s;en&s;ibility of the &s;ame kind with that which the olfactory
nerves have in more perfect animals. They may, as it were, ta&s;te
at a di&s;tance, and be attracted to their food by an affection of the
&s;ame organ by which they afterwards enjoy it; and Smell and Ta&s;te
may in them be no otherwi&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed than as weaker or &s;tronger
&s;en&s;ations derived from the &s;ame organ.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;ations of Heat and Cold, when excited by the pre&s;&s;ure
of &s;ome body either heated or cooled beyond the actual temperature
of our own organs, cannot be &s;aid, antecedently to ob&s;ervation and
experience, in&s;tinctively to &s;ugge&s;t any conception of the &s;olid and
re&s;i&s;ting &s;ub&s;tance which excites them. What was &s;aid of the &s;en&s;e
of Ta&s;te may very properly be &s;aid here. Before we can feel tho&s;e
&s;en&s;ations, the pre&s;&s;ure of the external body which excites them
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;ugge&s;t, not only &s;ome conception, but the mo&s;t
di&s;tinct conviction of its own external and independent exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>It may be otherwi&s;e, perhaps, when tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations are either
of them excited by the temperature of the external air. In a calm
<PB N="242" REF="327">
day when there is no wind, we &s;carcely perceive the external air as
a &s;olid body; and the &s;en&s;ations of Heat and Cold, it may be
thought, are then felt merely as affections of our own body, with|out
any reference to any thing external. Several ca&s;es, however,
may be conceived, in which it mu&s;t be allowed, I imagine, that
tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations, even when excited in this manner, mu&s;t &s;ugge&s;t
&s;ome vague notion of &s;ome external thing or &s;ub&s;tance which
excites them. A new-born animal, which had the power of &s;elf-motion,
and which felt its body, either agreeably or di&s;agreeably,
more heated or more cooled on the one &s;ide than on the other,
would, I imagine, in&s;tinctively, and antecedently to all ob&s;ervation
and experience, endeavour to move towards the &s;ide in which it felt
the agreeable, and to withdraw from that in which it felt the di&s;|agreeable
&s;en&s;ation. But the very de&s;ire of motion &s;uppo&s;es &s;ome
notion or preconception of externality; and the de&s;ire to move to|wards
the &s;ide of the agreeable, or from that of the di&s;agreeable &s;en|&s;ation,
&s;uppo&s;es at lea&s;t &s;ome vague notion of &s;ome external thing or
place which is the cau&s;e of tho&s;e re&s;pective &s;en&s;ations.</P>
<P>The degrees of Heat and Cold which are agreeable, it has been
found from experience, are likewi&s;e healthful; and tho&s;e which are
di&s;agreeable, unwhole&s;ome. The degree of their unwhole&s;omene&s;s,
too, &s;eems to be pretty much in proportion to that of their di&s;agree|ablene&s;s.
If either of them is &s;o di&s;agreeable as to be painful, it is
generally de&s;tructive; and that, too, in a very &s;hort period of time.
Tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations appear to have been given us for the pre&s;ervation
of our own bodies. They nece&s;&s;arily excite the de&s;ire of changing
our &s;ituation when it is unwhole&s;ome or de&s;tructive; and when it
is healthy, they allow us, or rather they entice us, to remain in it.
But the de&s;ire of changing our &s;ituation nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es &s;ome
idea of externality; or of motion into a place different from that
in which we actually are; and even the de&s;ire of remaining in the
<PB N="243" REF="328">
&s;ame place &s;uppo&s;es &s;ome idea of at lea&s;t the po&s;&s;ibility of changing.
Tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations could not well have an&s;wered the intention of
Nature, had they not thus in&s;tinctively &s;ugge&s;ted &s;ome vague notion
of external exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>That Sound, the object of the &s;en&s;e of Hearing, though perceived
it&s;elf as in the ear, and nowhere but in the ear, may likewi&s;e, in|&s;tinctively,
and antecedently to all ob&s;ervation and experience,
ob&s;curely &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome vague notion of &s;ome external &s;ub&s;tance or
thing which excites it, I am much di&s;po&s;ed to believe. I acknow|ledge,
however, that I have not been able to recollect any one
in&s;tance in which this &s;en&s;e &s;eems &s;o di&s;tinctly to produce this effect,
as that of Seeing, that of Smelling, and even that of Heat and Cold,
appear to do in &s;ome particular ca&s;es. Unu&s;ual and unexpected
Sound alarms always, and di&s;po&s;es us to look about for &s;ome external
&s;ub&s;tance or thing as the cau&s;e which excites it, or from which it
proceeds. Sound, however, con&s;idered merely as a &s;en&s;ation, or as
an affection of the organ of Hearing, can in mo&s;t ca&s;es neither be|nefit
nor hurt us. It may be agreeable or di&s;agreeable, but in its
own nature it does not &s;eem to announce any thing beyond the im|mediate
feeling. It &s;hould not therefore excite any alarm. Alarm
is always the fear of &s;ome uncertain evil beyond what is imme|diately
felt, and from &s;ome unknown and external cau&s;e. But all
animals, and men among the re&s;t, feel &s;ome degree of this alarm,
&s;tart, are rou&s;ed and rendered circum&s;pect and attentive by unu&s;ual
and unexpected Sound. This effect, too, is produced &s;o readily and
&s;o in&s;tantaneou&s;ly that it bears every mark of an in&s;tinctive &s;ug|ge&s;tion
of an impre&s;&s;ion immediately &s;truck by the hand of Nature,
which does not wait for any recollection of pa&s;t ob&s;ervation and
experience. The hare, and all tho&s;e other timid animals to whom
&s;light is the only defence, are &s;uppo&s;ed to po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;en&s;e of Hear|ing
<PB N="244" REF="329">
in the highe&s;t degree of activene&s;s. It &s;eems to be the &s;en&s;e in
which cowards are very likely to excel.</P>
<P>The three &s;en&s;es of Seeing, Hearing, and Smelling, &s;eem to be
given to us by Nature, not &s;o much in order to inform us concern|ing
the actual &s;ituation of our bodies, as concerning that of tho&s;e
other external bodies, which, though at &s;ome di&s;tance from us, may
&s;ooner or later affect that actual &s;ituation, and eventually either
benefit or hurt us.</P>
