<P>_THERE are &s;ome People &s;o remarkably Unhappy in the World, and &s;o particularly Stated, that what Side &s;o|ever gets uppermo&s;t, they are always undermo&s;t; whoever wins, they lo&s;e; and whoever mounts the Sad|dle, they are &s;ure to hold the Stirrop.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">
This &s;eems to have been the Ca&s;e of the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England,</HI> in all the &s;eve|ral changes that have happened in the State from&punc; the Re&s;toration to this Day; and &s;eeing that the Complaints which the Di&s;&s;enters have made of their Treat|ment in the&s;e Ca&s;es have been &s;o little regarded, it may not be ami&s;s di&s;tinctly to &s;tate to the World, the Behaviour of the Di&s;&s;enters in all the &s;aid &s;everal changes of publick Affairs, with re|&s;pect to the State; how they have de|&s;erved of, and how they have been treated by the &s;everal Parties, as tho&s;e Parties have gotten the upper hand of one another; by which we &s;hall &s;ee who are in the right, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether the blame laid by them, <HI>the Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> on the Government for Mal-treating them, or the blame laid by the re&s;pective Par|ties on them, <HI>the Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> for being dangerous to the Publick, be with the greater &s;trength of Rea&s;on and Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>That the Di&s;&s;enters have been loaden with Scandal, and reproach'd with being Enemies to the Government upon all Occa&s;ions, is better known than the Rea&s;on why it has been &s;o. It is true, the re&s;pective Princes on the Throne,
<PB N="5" REF="4">
have been &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Principals in all the Afflictions and Sufferings of the Di&s;&s;enters; but nothing is more certain than that, however the reigning Prince has been made u&s;e of as the In|&s;trumental Cau&s;e of the Di&s;&s;enters Inju|ries, it has been the effect of meer Party Management, as this o$ that &s;ide of either $word$ or Low Church obtain'd the A$min$$$$ation; &s;o that the King's being in effect Pa&s;&s;ive, tho' literally Active, therein, the Di&s;&s;enters have been Per&s;e|cuted or Spar'd, not as the Inclination o$ their Princes &s;tood to them, but as tho&s;e Princes were acted by their Mini|&s;try of this or that Party.</P>
<P>It is certain, that this di&s;covers an unhappy Truth, which it may be u&s;eful to ob&s;erve here, <HI>viz.</HI> How much the Princes of this Nation have all along been influenc'd by Parties, and how they have &s;ubjected them&s;elves to the manage|ment of their Mini&s;try, even to the Oppre&s;&s;ion of their People. The En|quiry of this Tract &s;hall be directed, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> To the Behaviour of the Di&s;&s;en|ters to either of the &s;aid Parties. <HI>Se|condly,</HI> The Treatment of the Di&s;&s;enters by the &s;aid Parties; and <HI>Thirdly,</HI> To decide the&s;e Que&s;tions.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="6" REF="5">
1. Whether the Di&s;&s;enters have been ju&s;tly and friendly dealt with or not by either Side?</P>
<P N="2">2. What may be the Con&s;equences of the Methods now taking with them?</P>
<P N="3">3. What the Di&s;&s;enters ought to do in the pre&s;ent Conjuncture of their Af|fairs, and how they ought to behave to the pre&s;ent Parties re&s;pectively.</P>
<P>What nece&s;&s;ary Inferences are to be drawn from the&s;e things, &s;hall be direct|ed impartially to every Side, Party, or Intere&s;t of Men among us.</P>
<P>The Presbyterian Part of the Di&s;&s;en|ters declar'd them&s;elves early for the Mo|narchy, long before the Death of <HI>Crom|well;</HI> dete&s;ting the Murder of the King, and declaring that the End of their ta|king Arms, was for the Defence of their Liberties only, and with no De&s;ign in the lea&s;t to dethrone the King their So|veraign: Much le&s;s to di&s;&s;olve the Go|vernment it &s;elf; and lea&s;t of all, to take the Blood of the King, who&s;e Per|&s;on they held as Sacred, as any others could pretend to hold it.</P>
<P>In the Pro&s;ecution of the&s;e Principles, they made Sundry Attempts to pull down, not <HI>Oliver</HI> only, but all the U&s;ur|pations
<PB N="7" REF="6">
of the executive Power and Authority which were made before him, in which many of their Leaders, as well as Mini&s;ters, lo&s;t their Lives by the Hand of the Executioner.</P>
<P>In the Re&s;tauration, they had &s;uch a leading Influence, that it has frequently been acknowledg'd by the King him&s;elf, that it could never have been effected without them.</P>
<P>It would be too &s;evere a <HI>Satyr</HI> on the Memory of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. and what the Native Goodne&s;s of his Di&s;po&s;ition does not de&s;erve; to &s;ay that the Treatment the&s;e People met with, in a very little time after his E&s;tabli&s;hment was, from, or with the Con&s;ent of his Inclination. It is well known, he was a Prince, who tho' he had Infirmities, too many to mention, and which Charity leaves to &s;leep with him in his Grave, yet had the mo&s;t Benign, Mild and Merciful Di&s;po&s;ition imaginable, with a Soft|ne&s;s and Tenderne&s;s which prevail'd on him to that degree, as it was often with great Difficulty that he could be brought to &s;ign a Warrant for the Execu|tion of Malefactors; and he would fre|quently &s;ay, That he heartily wi&s;h't that Bu&s;ine&s;s was left to the Judges, by an
<PB N="8" REF="7">
Act of Parliament; and that he might have nothing to do, but to &s;ave the Lives of his People, and &s;pare tho&s;e that were left to his Mercy.</P>
<P>Yet &s;uch wa sthe Influenc of Parties, &s;uch the Malignancy and I$veteracy of Factions and Divi&s;ions in the Court, that within four Years after that Re&s;to|ration, in which the &s;aid Di&s;&s;enters were &s;o In&s;trumental, the Penal Laws were put in Execution again&s;t the Di&s;&s;enters, divers others dayly Enacted, to re&s;train them not in matter of Power or Privilege only, but in matters meerly Religious, and the meer Exerci&s;e of wor&s;hipping God, according to the Dictates of Con|&s;cience.</P>
<P>I &s;ee no End of Entring into the De|tail of the Sufferings of the Di&s;&s;enters on this Account; nor is it the de&s;ign of this Tract, to leave any thing upon Record &s;o much to the Reproach of the Nation, as this would be, The Fines, the Impri|&s;onments, the Scandal and Reproaches ca&s;t upon the Di&s;&s;enters; the&s;e $ll &s;erve to make good what is noted above, <HI>viz.</HI> that it was all brought about by the In|fluences of Parties and Politick State&s;|men, for the carrying on their private De&s;igns, contrary to the Inclination of
<PB N="9" REF="8">
the King as he often declared; other|wi&s;e what need of all tho&s;e Slanders and Reproaches, Mi&s;repre&s;entations, and fal&s;e Accu&s;ations, Su&s;pitions and Surmi|&s;es, all of them being &s;o many Artifices, made u&s;e of as the Parties prevailed to bring the King to comply with their De&s;ign, and to prepare the Way for the Projects they had laid, and make the Per&s;ecution of the Di&s;&s;enters appear Rea&s;onable.</P>
<P>As the re&s;pective Intere&s;t of the&s;e Par|ties with the King ebb'd and flow'd, &s;o the Favour &s;hewn to the Di&s;&s;enters flacken'd or increa&s;ed; but it was al|ways ob&s;erv'd, That if ever the King acted him&s;elf, the Di&s;&s;enters found their Per&s;ecutions abate: Not that the King inclin'd towards them in Religion, for his End &s;hew'd what was his Inclination that way; but he being naturally of a Clement, kind Di&s;po&s;ition, cho&s;e rather to be ea&s;ie to every Body, than to pu&s;h their Misfortunes, which made the old Duke of <HI>B</HI>&mdash;&s;wear by his Maker, that he believ'd if the Prie&s;ts would let the King alone, he would turn as Er|rant a Presbyterian as he was, meaning him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9">
In the Pro&s;ecution of this Paper, I may come to let you &s;ee that the &s;ame Ca&s;e &s;eems to be now upon the Stage, and that what ever Evils the Di&s;&s;enters &s;hall &s;uffer at this time, they flow all from the mi&s;erable Di&s;traction of our Divi&s;ions and the Animo&s;ities of Parties; only with this difference, That the Di&s;|&s;enters as afore&s;aid, let what Side will prevail, are &s;ure to be Per&s;ecuted and Oppre&s;t, whereas before, one Side only Per&s;ecuted them, and the other deliver|ed them up to Per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>But to return to the former Times, Per|&s;ecution having been begun by the <HI>High-Church</HI> again&s;t the Di&s;&s;enters, and all the Me+rit of their Zeal; for the Re&s;toration being forgotten, their Enemies let loo&s;e upon them, and new Laws, &s;uch as the &amp; <HI>Cete|ra</HI> Oath. Corporation Act, &amp;c. made far|ther to &s;uppre&s;s them. Let us &s;ee how their Friends, the <HI>Low-Church,</HI> or as they ju&s;t then began to be call'd <HI>the Whigs,</HI> treated them.</P>
<P>Here we &s;hall &s;ee that what ever has been the Pretences, and however the Di&s;&s;enters have endeavoured to &s;erve and oblige either one Side or other, they have always been for&s;aken and given up.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10">
It was about the time when the late Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury,</HI> with the Duke of <HI>Bucks,</HI> and &s;everal other State&s;men fir&s;t appear'd again&s;t the Court Intere&s;t, That the Di&s;&s;enters had obtained &s;ome Rece&s;s. The Second Per&s;ecution as it may be call'd, had abated, and the Subtilty of &s;ome State&s;men having work'd the Court up to &s;ome Unea&s;yne&s;s on the <HI>High-Church</HI> Side, the Jealou&s;ie of Po|pery began to be Popular, and the Coun|try Party, &s;o they were then call'd, had obtained a Footing in the Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> contrives the Act, call'd the Te&s;t Act, and cau&s;ed it to be brought into the Hou&s;e, in Order to keep all the Papi&s;ts in <HI>England</HI> out of Places, as he afterwards did another Bill to Exclude them from the <HI>Hou&s;e of Lords.</HI></P>
<P>When this Act was fir&s;t brought up|on the Stage, the Court was again&s;t it, that was to be expected; but the <HI>High-Church</HI> oppo&s;ed it al&s;o which was a Difficulty, that the other Party knew not how to get over; but at la&s;t, knowing the hatred they had to the <HI>Phanaticks,</HI> this cunning Statesman lays a Hook for the <HI>High Church,</HI> baited with <HI>Pha|natick,</HI> contriving to draw them all in to Clo&s;e with the Bill, for Excluding
<PB N="12" REF="11">
the Papi&s;ts by telling them the <HI>High Church)</HI> that this Bill, as it would exclude all the Papi&s;ts in the Kingdom on one hand, &s;o it would all Fanaticks on the the other; and &s;o the Churchmen would be &s;ure to enjoy all the Honours, Tru&s;ts and Pre|ferments in the Nation.</P>
<P>He knew this would take with the High Church, but how to wheedle the Di&s;&s;enters to &s;ubmit to it that, he found ve|ry difficult; yet it mu&s;t be done, they mu&s;t not only be brought to acquie&s;ce, but to court the Mi&s;chief, and be active in it even upon them&s;elves.</P>
<P>This was about the Year 1672. upon which the famous Te&s;t-Act was framed 25. <HI>Car.</HI> II, <HI>cap.</HI> 2. whereby all Per&s;ons who &s;hould enjoy any Place, Office, or Employment of Tru&s;t or Profit, Military or Civil in the whole Kingdom, were obliged to take the Oaths therein ap|pointed, and to take the Sacrament after the u&s;age of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> on the Penalty of 500 <HI>l</HI> be&s;ides other in|capacitating and di&s;abling Clau&s;es, &s;uch as to be di&s;abled to Sue or u&s;e any Action, Bill, Plaint or Information in cour&s;e of Law, or to pro&s;ecute any Suit in any Court of Equity, or to be Guardian of any Child, or Executer, or Admini&s;tra|tor
<PB N="13" REF="12">
of any Per&s;on, or capable of any Le|gacy or deed of Gift, or to beat any D$fice within the Kingdom, &amp;c.</P>
<P>It is remarkable the Title of this Act is, <HI>An Act to prevent Dangers ari&s;ing from Popi&s;h Recu&s;ants:</HI> The Title was &s;pecious, the Zeal of the Di&s;&s;enters again&s;t Popery was well known, and the Bill bearing a Title re&s;pecting the Papi&s;ts, the Di&s;&s;en|ters were not allarm'd at all at it, few of them knew the Extent of the Bill, or that they were any ways concern'd in it.</P>
<P>When it was brought into the Hou&s;e, Alderman <HI>LOVE,</HI> Member of Parlia|ment for the City, and a Di&s;&s;enter, &s;aw into the Particulars, and pre&s;ently found that the Di&s;&s;enters were involv'd in the Penalty of the Bill; and applying him&s;elf to my Lord <HI>Shaftsbury,</HI> he &s;poke &s;eri|ou&s;ly to him about it, Repre&s;enting that the Bill was pretended to be directed again&s;t the Papi&s;ts, that the Di&s;&s;enters being ready at all times to join with the Church again&s;t Popery, had made no op|po&s;ition to the Bill, but that it was evident by the Tenour of this Bill, the Di&s;&s;enters would be equally involved in the Penalty, tho' not equally guilty of the Crime; for that Popery was judged De&s;tructive to the whole frame of the Con&s;titution,
<PB N="14" REF="13">
and Papi&s;ts were already voted Dange|rous to the State; whereas, the Di&s;&s;en|ters being Prote&s;tants, and already under the re&s;traint of divers Laws, were in the &s;ame Intere&s;t with the Church as to their oppo&s;ition to Popery, and unable any way to act contrary to the State Intere&s;t, en|treating his Lord&s;hip that if the &s;aid Bill was aim'd at the Di&s;&s;enters, he would be plain with him, and let him have it from his own Mouth; and that then they&punc; knew what Mea&s;ures to take, and what they had to do; and if there was no &s;uch de|&s;ign, then he beg'd of his Lord&s;hip, the Di&s;&s;enters might not be ruined <HI>per</HI> Acci|dent, and that Provi&s;ion might be made in the Bill to except the Di&s;&s;enters, and prevent their falling into the Snare with the Papi&s;ts, again&s;t whom the Bill was really and openly directed</P>
<P>My Lord told him, That it was far from their Thoughts that the Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters &s;hould be involved in the Mi&s;|chief he apprehended, much le&s;s that that they &s;hould be rank'd with Papi&s;ts either in the Opinion of the Legi&s;lature, or in the penalty of the Law, and promi&s;ed to take care of it.</P>
<P><HI>But the Bill went on in the Hou&s;e, and was pu&s;h'd warmly by the Intere&s;t of the</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="14">
<HI>&s;aid Lords; and the Country Party,</HI> not having yet the Appellation of Whigs, <HI>in the Lower Hou&s;e; when Mr.</HI> LO&V;E <HI>afore|&s;aid, applying to my Lord</HI> Shaftsbury <HI>the &s;econd Time, to the &s;ame purpo&s;e as be|fore,</HI> My Lord told him <HI>he found a &s;trong Oppo&s;ition from the Court Party again&s;t the Bill, and that they had drawn in a great many Church Men to oppo&s;e it; and Mr.</HI> Love <HI>&s;ays my Lord,</HI> if we &s;hould but mention a Clau&s;e of Exception to them for the Di&s;&s;enters YET, we &s;hall certainly lo&s;e the Bill, which being of the utmo&s;t Con|&s;equence to the Safety of the Prote&s;tant Religion again&s;t Popery, it would be the Ruine of the Di&s;&s;enters and of the Church too in the End. <HI>It is very hard my Lord &s;aid Mr.</HI> Love, That the Di&s;&s;enters who are Prote&s;tants, &s;hould &s;uffer under the &s;ame Predicament as Popi&s;h Recu&s;ants, and that the Prote&s;tant Religion cannot be &s;ecur'd without our Ruin: Tho&s;e Gentlemen, who your Lord&s;hip &s;ays oppo&s;e the Bill, are it &s;eems Prote&s;tants, and ought at lea&s;t to have as much concern for the Prote&s;tant Religi|on as the Di&s;&s;enters; and if they will oppo&s;e the Bill, unle&s;s the Di&s;&s;enters are given up to them for a Prey, we may much better oppo&s;e the Bill to prevent our immediate Ruin; <HI>upon which Words Mr.</HI> Love <HI>took his Leave, and was retiring. But</HI></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="15">
<HI>My Lord</HI> Shaftsbury <HI>call'd him again, Mr.</HI> Love, <HI>&s;ays my Lord,</HI> I &s;hall be very &s;or|ry to &s;ee the Di&s;&s;enters appear to oppo&s;e a Bill, again&s;t Popery, and e&s;pecially at a time when it is &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the <HI>pub|blick Good,</HI> and that without it the <HI>Pa|pi&s;t Party,</HI> and the Court Party who are now joyn'd, will break in upon our Liberties, and ruine the whole Nation; I have thought of an Expedient for it, which is this; if you will acquie&s;ce <HI>that this Bill may pa&s;s,</HI> we will <HI>promi&s;e you</HI> that we will have ano|ther Bill brought in, on purpo&s;e to explain this Act, and excepting the Prote&s;tant Di&s;|&s;enters, re&s;train it to the Popi&s;h Recu&s;ants, according to the Title.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Love</HI> who knew the Danger, was unwilling; but finding they were re|&s;olved to pu&s;h the Bill, and con&s;idering the odium it would bring on the Di&s;&s;en|ters, if they &s;hould cau&s;e &s;o good a Law to be thrown out: He acquie&s;ced upon the &s;olemn Engagement as afore&s;aid, to give them a Clau&s;e of Qualification, as it was called, and thus the Bill pa&s;t; as for the Promi&s;e they never thought more of it.</P>
<P>Thus the Di&s;&s;enters were cheated by the&mdash;<HI>for the fir&s;t Time,</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="16">
how often they have been &s;o &s;erv'd &s;ince, time will di&s;cover.</P>
<P>This Act was no &s;ooner pa&s;t, but it be|gan to affect the Di&s;&s;enters, the Papi&s;ts being but little concern'd in it, and the general Bent of this Act has &s;ince that been to &s;uppre&s;s the Di&s;&s;enters; the <HI>Low-Church</HI> Men were the Men who brought it in, all the Promi&s;es they made to the Di&s;&s;enters were forgot, and all the At|tempts which have been made &s;ince that to exempt the Di&s;&s;enters from the Pe|nalties of it have been rendred vain, and been principally oppo&s;ed by the <HI>Low-Church</HI> Men as they are now call'd, as we &s;hall mo&s;t effectually prove in the Pro|ce&s;s of the&s;e Sheets; notwith&s;tanding the readine&s;s which the Di&s;&s;enters have upon all Occa&s;ions &s;hew'd to &s;erve and &s;upport their Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>It was not many Years after this, be|fore the Church of <HI>England</HI> came into &s;uch Circum&s;tances, as that it was very much in the power of the Di&s;&s;enters to have requited this Ingratitude of that Party; and this was when King <HI>James</HI> came to the Crown, who having a de&s;ign to bring the Papi&s;ts into publick Tru&s;t and Employment, care&s;s'd the Di&s;&s;enters with all the Art and Craft that it was po&s;|&s;ible
<PB N="18" REF="17">
to u&s;e, and &s;hewing them the Bait, <HI>viz,</HI> the Repealing this Act, doubted not to bring the whole Body of the Di&s;|&s;enters into the Snare, and by their help to get this Te&s;t-Act, as well as the other Penal Laws, by which the Di&s;&s;en|ters had been per&s;ecuted, Repealed.</P>
<P>It is more to be wondred at, that any of the Di&s;&s;enters, con&s;idering how they had been treated, &s;hould refu&s;e this ad|vantageous Offer, than that a few were drawn into it; the Di&s;&s;enters might very well have argued, <HI>That</HI> altho' it might be true, that this Act being repealed, the Papi&s;ts would enjoy the Benefit of it, yet <HI>That</HI> their Duty was to recover their lo&s;t Liberty, and they were not to &s;tand in their own light, and refu&s;e the Ad|vantage of &s;ecuring their Religious Li|berty, which if they omitted then, might never be offered again; and all this upon the pretence that Papi&s;ts would reap the Advantage in Conjunction with them; <HI>That</HI> there might be other ways to prevent Popery coming in, with|out entailing a &s;piritual Bondage upon them&s;elves and their Po&s;terity, on a pretence of the fear of Popery; <HI>That</HI> Popery was kept out before this Act was made, and might be afterward; <HI>That</HI> if
<PB N="19" REF="18">
not, it was their indi&s;pen&s;ible Duty to re&s;tore them&s;elves and their Families to the native Rights of Subjects and Chri|&s;tians, and to leave the I&s;&s;ue to God' Pro|vidence. THESE had been very ju&s;t Arguments, and the Di&s;&s;enters had all the Rea&s;on in the World, had they re|garded their Intere&s;t as Di&s;&s;enters, to have pleaded thus for them&s;elves, and have Join'd with King <HI>James</HI> for the Repealing the &s;aid per&s;ecuting Act.</P>
<P>But the Di&s;&s;enters acted from another principle, and laying a&s;ide the Views of their private intere&s;t as Di&s;&s;enters, They con&s;idered them&s;elves as Prote&s;tants, and as <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men, the Church party was then, by the &s;en&s;e of common Danger, United again&s;t the Inva&s;ions of a Popi&s;h Government and an Arbitrary Prince; Whig and Tory had been &s;ome years known indeed, but began now to be lo&s;t, and the Debates run all between Liberty and Arbitrary Power, Prote&s;tant and Pa|pi&s;ts: <HI>The Di&s;&s;enters</HI> came into the &s;en&s;e of the Common Danger, and laying a&s;ide the Memory of their former ill U&s;age, generou&s;ly Join'd again&s;t the Po|pi&s;h King, quitted the Advantage which they had of Repealing that Act, and cho&s;e to lye at the Mercy of the
<PB N="20" REF="19">
Church, whether <HI>High</HI> or <HI>Low,</HI> rather than abandon the publick Safety; and thus, <HI>a very few excepted,</HI> the whole body of the Di&s;&s;enters joyn'd in the In|vitation of the Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, they Capitulated for the having a Legal Tolleration e&s;tabli&s;hed for them by Act of Parliament, which was afterwards perform'd by the Church of <HI>England</HI> Men, in the fir&s;t of <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> Cap. xvii. which is the Act of Tolleration which we now enjoy.</P>
<P>The Di&s;&s;enters have been blam'd, and that ju&s;tly too, That when this happy Treaty of Agreement was made between them and the Nobility, Gentry, and Clergy of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> for the Defence of the Prote&s;tant Religion, and of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liberties, they had not entred into the Particulars, and con|dition'd al&s;o for the pre&s;erving them|&s;elves from the future Incidents, which were &s;o evident, as that they could not be &s;aid not to fore&s;ee them, <HI>(viz.)</HI> &s;uch as an Exemption of Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters from the &s;aid Sacramental Te&s;t; the ac|cepting the Affirmation of tho&s;e who Con&s;cienciou&s;ly &s;crupled to take an Oath; the allowance of Schools and Tutors, as

<P>It is hardly to be imagin'd with what Ill-nature and Reflections this Recom|mendation, however ju&s;t in it &s;elf, how|ever needful for the publick Good, and however proper at that time for the Service, of his Maje&s;ty, was rejected even as if it had been an attempt made upon the whole Church of <HI>England;</HI> as if the
<PB N="25" REF="24">
Te&s;t-Act had been made entirely and &s;ingly again&s;t the Di&s;&s;enters, and not again&s;t Papi&s;ts; and as if one had been equally dangerous to the Church as the other.</P>
<P>The King was &s;urpriz'd at it, and wonder'd to find &s;uch a Temper in the Churchmen, while the Sence of their Deliverance was yet &s;o fre&s;h upon them; and while the Dangers they had been de|livered from, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance the Di&s;|&s;enters had given them were, or ought to have been &s;o fre&s;h in their Memories.</P>
<P>But the King &s;aw there was nothing to be done, and was obliged thereby to refu&s;e the Offers which divers Di&s;&s;en|ters had made him, to rai&s;e Regiments for his Service, and to &s;erve in Per&s;on in the War then coming on; one would have thought after this, the Di&s;&s;enters &s;hould never have flatter'd them&s;elves with the hopes of any fair treatment from their Enemies, and &s;hould have been very wary how they gave them|&s;elves up any more for their Service; but we can no more avoid than fore&s;ee our Fate.</P>
<P>We find no attempt made in favour of the Di&s;&s;enters for &s;ome years after this, but &s;everal attempts again&s;t them, &s;ome|times

<P>About the latter end of the late King, the Church-men them&s;elves fell out, and began to divide into <HI>Hhigh-church</HI> and <HI>Low,</HI> as the Whigs did afterwards into <HI>Old Whig</HI> and <HI>Modern.</HI> The King died in the height of this breach, and the Queen coming to the Throne, <HI>High-Church</HI> got the Reins of the Admini&s;tration; but drove &s;o furiou&s;ly, that <HI>Phaeton</HI> like, they &s;et the whole Nation in a flame, and obliged her Maje&s;ty to change Hands in order to pur&s;ue tho&s;e wi&s;er and more prudent mea&s;ures, which her own merci|ful Inclination, and the Council of bet|ter Heads directed her to</P>
<P>The Product of this fir&s;t Precipitation was, that the&s;e Men fall upon the Di&s;&s;en|ters, <HI>Jehu</HI> like, to &s;hew <HI>their Zeal for the Lord,</HI> and to make the People of <HI>England</HI> believe, that all the re&s;t of their proceed|ings were Calculated for the Good of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> the many extrava|gant things they did at that time, de|&s;erve rather to be forgotten than remem|bred, that we might make room for that

univer&s;al Charity and Peace which we &s;till hope &s;ometime or other this Nation may be ble&s;s'd with. But Two mu&s;t be mention'd for a Specimen: <HI>The one</HI> was, Their Addre&s;&s;ing the Queen to extend her Prerogative, an Addre&s;s we never &s;aw a parallel of, and had not <HI>England</HI> been ble&s;t with a Queen equally con|cern'd for the Liberties of her People, as for her own Safety, Who knows how far it might have been extended at that time? <HI>The other</HI> was, The Occa&s;ional Bill, Three times brought into the Hou&s;e, as often Thrown out by the meer Influ|ence of the Court, and at la&s;t the Party thrown out that pu&s;h'd it forward.</P>
<P>The&s;e Occa&s;ional Bills were all founded on the Te&s;t-Act, which it was alledged the Di&s;&s;enters had Evaded the force of, by an Hypocritical Compliance with the Church of <HI>England</HI> Ceremonies in Com|munion, at the &s;ame time that they pre|tended Con&s;cientiou&s;ly to di&s;&s;ent, and to Continue to do &s;o after they had Con|form'd, only by way of quallification.</P>
<P>In this Article of Occa&s;ional Conformi|ty, the Di&s;&s;enters were <HI>at fir&s;t</HI> attack'd by <HI>High-Church,</HI> and the faint Oppo&s;i|tion of <HI>Low-Church</HI> was &s;uch, as that the Di&s;&s;enters were not oblig'd to the <HI>Low-Church</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="27">
Men for the lo&s;s of that Bill, &s;o much as to the Ob&s;tinacy of the <HI>High-Church,</HI> who depending upon their own &s;trength, refus'd to comply with one Tri|fling Amendment of the Lords, which they would gladly have abated afterward, and &s;o lo&s;t their Bill; &s;o that in this fir&s;t Bill it was evident, that both Parties, the <HI>High</HI> and <HI>Low</HI> agreed in the main thing, <HI>(viz.)</HI> to give them up, and that the Occa&s;ional Conformity of the Di&s;&s;en|ters &s;hould be &s;uppre&s;t.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd <HI>Occa&s;ional Bill,</HI> it was plain both Parties had left them again, had not the Queen interpo&s;ed, and that the Tenderne&s;s of her Maje&s;ty, and Her Concern to Unite the minds of all her People, was the foundation of all the Oppo&s;ition made to the Bill, and the Influence which her Maje&s;ty, and by her e&s;pecial Direction the Court Party had upon the Nobility, were in a great mea&s;ure In&s;trumental to prevent the Con&s;equences, and &s;o the &s;aid Bill was Thrown out. <HI>The third</HI> attempt was the Tack, which Untack'd the <HI>High Church</HI> Party, and put an end to the thing.</P>
<P>In this part the late Mini&s;try being E&s;tabli&s;h'd, and new Hands employ'd in every part of the Admini&s;tration, the
<PB N="29" REF="28">
whole <HI>Low-Church</HI> &s;trength had appear'd again&s;t the Bill&punc; in&s;omuch that it was made a meer Dr. <HI>Sacheverel</HI> to the Na|tion, made the <HI>Low</HI> Party popular, and brought the &s;acking Members into &s;uch Contempt, that the next Hou&s;e of Com|mons were of a quite differing Temper than the la&s;t. This was that famous <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament, the la&s;t of that Name, wherein Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> was Cho&s;en Speaker again&s;t the <HI>High-Church</HI> Party, who Voted for Mr. <HI>Bromely</HI> now Speaker; by which Parliament, the Union which had been fini&s;hed by Treaty, and rati|fied in <HI>Scotland,</HI> was Pa&s;&s;ed and Exem|plified.</P>
<P>If a <HI>Whig</HI> Parliament may ever be &s;uppo&s;ed to do any thing to the Ea&s;e and Relief of the Di&s;&s;enters, it might ha' been expected from that Parliament, and this is the Rea&s;on why &s;o much is &s;aid of the Circum&s;tances of their Sitting; They had &s;o much Temper, and &s;o exten&s;ive a Charity, as to Ratify and Pa&s;s the Act of Security for the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> under the Title of <HI>E&s;tabli&s;hing the true Prote&s;tant Religion;</HI> they &s;hewed all po&s;&s;ible tenderne&s;s and moderation in &s;e|veral Ca&s;es which came before them, and the Di&s;&s;enters had &s;o much hopes from
<PB N="30" REF="29">
them, that it began to be the general Opinion, That then was the only time that the Di&s;&s;enters might expect, and ought to get the <HI>Te&s;t Act</HI> Repealed.</P>
<P>Some indeed di&s;$waded the Attempt, and thought the Sea&s;on not ripe, and that it would alarm the Nation, who by the <HI>High-Church</HI> falling in with the hint, would be jealous of the Church, and do the Di&s;&s;enters more harm than good; but others more Confident, and le&s;s Prudent, were for pu&s;hing their Fate, and put an Antient, Superannuated, tho' Good Man, upon the Attempt, who wrote a Paper again&s;t the <HI>Sacramental Te&s;t</HI> Addre&s;s'd to the Parliament.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was this Paper publi&s;hed, but the <HI>Low Church</HI> Men in the Hou&s;e, whether they were afraid of being &s;u|&s;pected to favour the De&s;ign&punc; and &s;hould be repre&s;ented in the Countries where they were cho&s;en, as Enemies to the Church, and &s;o &s;hould never be cho&s;en again, or that they were really zealous again&s;t giving any Relaxation to the Di&s;&s;enters, I know not, but certain it was, that THEY were the fir&s;t that re|&s;ented the Attempt, and moved the Hou&s;e to enquire for, and puni&s;h the Author of the &s;aid Paper.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="30">
One would think the Di&s;&s;enters might have learnt to have done making Com|pliments of them&s;elves after this, either to one Church Party or another; but the mea&s;ure of their Weakne&s;s, or of the Ingratitude of the other, was not yet fill'd up.</P>
<P>For no &s;ooner was the late change made in the Mini&s;try, and things began to take a new turn at Court, but the Di&s;&s;enters, as has always been their Fate, felt the weight of the Storm, and who|ever &s;hall be Gainers, in the end of the&s;e things, we know not; but in the mean time it is evident, that either &s;ide make havock of the Intere&s;ts of the Di&s;&s;enters, and if at any time an occa&s;ion pre&s;ents, will make a Peace with one another at the Di&s;&s;enters expence.</P>
<P>Many People write warmly in favour of the Di&s;&s;enters, and &s;hew a Zeal for their Advantage, who cannot effectually direct them in the&s;e difficult times; They are a great body of Men, but not a uni|ted Body, not a concerted cemented Body; he that is a true Friend to the Di&s;&s;enters, will advi&s;e them never to ex|pect any thing from the Quarrels of Par|ties, and the Heats and Feuds of the State, except it be to be de&s;troyed and
<PB N="32" REF="31">
devoured, and to act between the Par|ties as People who have nothing el&s;e to expect.</P>
<P>Who would have thought, but that in this la&s;t Breach at Court, the <HI>Low-Church</HI> Men &s;hould have e&s;pou&s;ed the Di&s;&s;enters as their Friends and faithful Allies, who had cleav'd to them in the wor&s;t of Times; &s;tood hard and fa&s;t by them in every Exi|gence; had voted for them in every Election, and without their Votes, not one turn in the &s;everal Changes made in favour of the <HI>Low-Church</HI> could have been carried.</P>
<P>The Whigs cannot &s;ay that ever they had a &s;truggle with the Tories, in which the &s;aid Tories did not over&punc;match them in Elections, but for the Intere&s;t of the Di&s;&s;enters; and that in all &s;uch nice oc|ca&s;ions it was the Di&s;&s;enters who turn'd the Scale in favour of the <HI>Low-Church:</HI> Can then any Man &s;ay, that the Di&s;&s;en|ters had no rea&s;on to expect that the <HI>Low-Church</HI> Men &s;hould have been their Friends, much more that they &s;hould not have given up the Di&s;&s;enters to their implacable Enemies? and yet &s;uch is the Gratitude of Parties. The fir&s;t occa&s;ion which pre&s;ented to the <HI>Low-Church</HI> Men, wherein they thought their Political
<PB N="33" REF="32">
Game required it, they &s;old their Friends the Di&s;&s;enters, and made a Sacrifice of them to their profe&s;s'd Enemy the Earl of <HI>N&mdash;m.</HI></P>
<P>And yet &s;uch was Heavens Ju&s;tice in the Ca&s;e, that this Sacrifice which was to an Idol, not to God, had the &s;ucce&s;s it de&s;erv'd, for they were di&s;ap|pointed in their Bargain, and like the Infernals in <HI>Milton,</HI> being deceiv'd with the guilded Fruit, when they began to gather and eat, they found their Mouths filled with bitter A&s;hes: So the Reward of their Treachery and Ingratitude to the Di&s;&s;enters, for it can bear no le&s;s a Term, was an utter di&s;appointment, and to be in the &s;ame &s;till or a more &s;uppre&s;s'd Ca&s;e than they were in before, from whence it would be &s;trange if Heaven &s;hould ever deliver them by &s;uch Un|righteous means, or till they &s;hall do Ju&s;tice to tho&s;e whom they have treated in that unexampled Manner.</P>
<P>We are next to come to what the <HI>High-Church</HI> will do with them: Of the Two the&s;e are the fairer, becau&s;e the&s;e never profe&s;s'd any favour to the Di&s;&s;enters; the&s;e always declar'd, That they thought them dangerous both to the Church and to the State; that the Liber|ty they had enjoy'd was too much; and
<PB N="34" REF="33">
that they took Liberties which were not granted them by Law; and there|fore it was &s;omething rational for the Di&s;&s;enters to expect that whenever the&s;e Men came to a full exerci&s;e of Power, they would certainly fall upon the Di&s;|&s;enters, and re&s;train them as much as they were able.</P>
<P>Whether the Di&s;&s;enters have done well or ill in aggravating and farther provoking the <HI>High-Church</HI> Men, who they knew all along to be their impla|cable Adver&s;aries, this I will not deter|mine; and if the Di&s;&s;enters had, as no doubt they were per&s;waded they had a probability in view by the oppo&s;ition which they made to the <HI>High-Church,</HI> to overthrow their new Schemes, if, I &s;ay, they had a full Satisfaction of this, tho' they were mi&s;taken, yet I cannot &s;ay they were &s;o much to blame on that &s;ide.</P>
<P>But the mi&s;take of the Di&s;&s;enters has been in their not di&s;tingui&s;hing between the <HI>High-Church</HI> Party meerly <HI>as &s;uch,</HI> and the <HI>Court-Party</HI> who then govern'd, and who altho' they were joyn'd with the <HI>High-Church,</HI> that is, had taken the <HI>High-Church</HI> in with them for the &s;up|port of the Changes they had made,
<PB N="35" REF="34">
and for the ballancing the di&s;contented People who adhered to the late Mini&s;try, yet were on &s;everal Accounts obliged to hold a Ballance between the <HI>High Church</HI> and the Di&s;&s;enters, to prevent on one hand, the &s;aid <HI>High-Church</HI> in their too warm Attempts upon the Di&s;&s;enters, and on the other hand, to re&s;train the Di&s;|&s;enters from any Encroachments upon the Church, and &s;o to hold the Rems of the Admini&s;tration between both, as that the re&s;pective Parties &s;hould not have been able to have pu&s;h'd at one another.</P>
<P>This not only was the Wi&s;dom of the Court to do, but it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;a|ry for them to do, and it is apparent they have done it as long as was po&s;&s;ible, till the Di&s;&s;enters having &s;o ab&s;olutely and &s;o long &s;tood out, and the <HI>High-Church,</HI> on the other hand, impatient of any longer re&s;traint, it may be &s;aid they the Min&s;try can do it no longer.</P>
<P>This was the only &s;afe Game the Di&s;|&s;enters had to play, and this had pre&s;erv'd them, not that by this any thing had been required of the Di&s;&s;enters which had not been agreeable to both their Princ pl$s and frequent Practi&s;es, and e&s;pecially to their Intere&s;t; and let no Man mi&s;take what is here &s;aid, as if I meant that the Di&s;&s;enters &s;hould have fallen in with the
<PB N="38" REF="35">
<HI>High-Church</HI> to back the Mini&s;try, no not in the lea&s;t; but I do not at the &s;ame time &s;ee what Call they had to fall in with the Party Men of the <HI>Low-Church</HI> again&s;t the Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>The changes of State&s;men and Parties in the Court, has always been the effect of the heavings and &s;trugglings of great Men to get into Places and Preferments; the Queen's Power, to name who &s;he thinks fit to Admini&s;ter her Government by, we cannot di&s;pute, and &s;o long as that Government is re&s;train'd and re&s;tricted within the limits of the Con&s;titution, we may, with Ju&s;tice to our &s;elves, and Duty to our Country Acquie&s;ce, nay we ought to do &s;o.</P>
<P>Had the Di&s;&s;enters nothing to hazard, were their Circum&s;tances de&s;perate, had they no Po&s;terity to provide for, no Liber|ties which they ow'd to the favour of the Admini&s;tration to pre&s;erve, and which by declaring them&s;elves they might run the hazard of lo&s;ing, more might have been &s;aid.</P>
<P>But as it was the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Di&s;&s;en|ters &s;eem'd to be, by an equal Conduct, to have re&s;erv'd them&s;elves for the Event of things, to have acted as <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> Vo|ted as they thought fit, and according to their Con&s;cience upon all Occa&s;ions, care|fully
<PB N="37" REF="36">
cheri&s;h'd their Religious Concerns, made them&s;elves as few Enemies as po&s;&s;i|ble, provok'd no body willingly, never have been Aggre&s;&s;ors in any Breaches, and have let their Enemies have had no room to &s;ay, that they mingled their Reli|gious Concerns with the &s;everal Factions in the State.</P>
<P>Had they done this, the Mini&s;try had never had the lea&s;t room for, much le&s;s have been brought to the nece&s;&s;ity of let|ting the <HI>High-Church</HI> break in upon them, nor perhaps had the Mini&s;try ever been in &s;uch a Circum&s;tance, wherein it might be &s;aid of them that they cannot prevent it.</P>
<P>But our mi&s;take has been, That we have look'd upon the Mini&s;try in the State, and the <HI>High-Flyer</HI> in the Church, to be the &s;ame thing; it may be true, that they are at this time Allies, but that they are but one Party is a mi&s;take, for they have been often Two, and may be &s;o again; And why &s;hould not the Di&s;&s;enters put them&s;elves in a po&s;ture to have it be &s;o again?</P>
<P>The Intention of the Mini&s;try to have held this Ballance, if we would have &s;uf|fer'd them, was plain in that Quotation out of a Book called <HI>Faults on both Sides,</HI> quoted lately in the <HI>Flying-Po&s;t, June</HI> 3. and taken from the afore&s;aid Book, <HI>p.</HI> 43. as follows.</P>

<P>Here it is evident, that the Court profe&s;&s;es to begin their new Admini&s;tration with a view to moderate Mea&s;ures, to keep every thing on the &s;ame foot as before, and that the Mini&s;try de&s;ign'd only to hold the Ballance be|tween the Contending, Intere&s;ts, pre&s;erving the re&s;pective Rights on either Side, if the Mini&s;try are to be &s;uppo&s;ed Originally de&s;ign|ing the ruine of one in favour of the other while they made the&s;e declarations, they mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to be All that their wor&s;t Ene|mies can call them; but as there are &s;ome good Rea&s;ons to be given to prove this was never their INTEREST, and that thence we may believe without any flattery that it was not their De&s;ign, &s;o we &s;ee but little to prove the Affirmative, That they had the wicked pur|po&s;e afore&s;aid from the beginning.</P>

If the Tories have led them on farther than they intended to go, it mu&s;t have been becau&s;e the Tories are become more nece&s;&s;ary than they were before, and therefore make their own Advantages of that Circum&s;tance, and this mu&s;t be from &s;ome Oppo&s;ition which was not Expected, and which has driven the Mi|ni&s;try from their fir&s;t Mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>Whether the Di&s;&s;enters have had any &s;hare in this or no, I will not determin, for this is not written to Accu&s;e, but to Advi&s;e them; <HI>if they have,</HI> their Zeal may be good, but their Prudence will not be the better.</P>
<P>They may &s;ee now, that when the Tories fall upon them, the <HI>Low-church</HI> Men do not e|&s;pou&s;e them as Di&s;&s;enters, &s;ome Vote again&s;t the Bill now Depending indeed, but they pretend not to do it in Favour of Di&s;&s;enters, as a Religious Party, <HI>there they all give us up,</HI> but as Members of their Politick Party, and this has always been the fate of the Di&s;&s;en|ters; <HI>and will be &s;o,</HI> till it plea&s;es God to give them a rectification of judgment to Conduct their Affairs &s;o, as may make them bear &s;ome weight in the Commonwealth, and make it worth while to the Parties, both to pre&s;erve them, and pre&s;erve an Intere&s;t with them; then they would be true to their own Inte|re&s;t, and have many Opportunities put into their Hands to make them&s;elves u&s;eful to their Country, which now they are depriv'd of.</P>
