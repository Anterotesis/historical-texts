<P>WHY are &s;ome men &s;et over other
men to rule and govern them?
This is a que&s;tion we promi&s;ed to examine,
but it will be nece&s;&s;ary, in the fir&s;t place,
to enquire of what <HI>u&s;e</HI> Government is,
for nothing that is u&s;ele&s;s can be worth
&s;upporting at all; but if we &s;ucceed in
finding out its u&s;es, we &s;hall ea&s;ily com|prehend
<PB N="4" REF="3">
every thing el&s;e relating to its
e&s;tabli&s;hment. And thus we &s;hall &s;et Go|vernment
upon a broad and firm founda|tion,
a foundation which no man would
even wi&s;h to undermine, for no one de&s;ires
to de&s;troy that which is a benefit to him.
You have probably read the &s;tory of the
Old Man with the bundle of Arrows, and
you know that &s;ingly we are all of us
weak, but collectively &s;trong. You know
too that one man cannot make all the
things he wants. One of you can plough
the land; another graft and prune trees;
another weave cloth; another &s;hape and
fa&s;hion the tools by which the&s;e things
are done. It is therefore very de&s;ireable
that men &s;hould a&s;&s;ociate and live together.
It is likewi&s;e plea&s;ant, and agreeable to
the nature of Man, who loves &s;ociety, to
be thus a&s;&s;ociated. You mu&s;t be con|vinced
of this by the plea&s;ure you take in
<PB N="5" REF="4">
forming your&s;elves into little clubs, and
knots of neighbourhood. A State is a
more numerous club; a wider neighbour|hood;
an a&s;&s;ociation including all le&s;&s;er
a&s;&s;ociations: but as it is difficult at once
for the under&s;tanding to embrace an object
of &s;uch magnitude, the greater will be
better comprehended by beginning with
the le&s;s. If your child wants to know
what a State is, take him between your
knees and &s;ay to him&mdash;&startq;My child!
when you were very little, our &s;mall
cottage, and its &s;pot of garden-ground,
was all that you were acquainted with
of the wide world. Your mother nou|ri&s;hed
you at her brea&s;t, I carried you in
my arms; your brothers and &s;i&s;ters played
with and care&s;&s;ed you: all people be&s;ides
were &s;trangers to you; &s;o far from wi&s;hing
to &s;ee them, you &s;hrunk and hung back
when they approached. Thus we guarded
<PB N="6" REF="5">
the feeble beginnings of your life, as we
guard a taper that is ju&s;t lit; &s;preading
the hands anxiou&s;ly round it to &s;helter it
from wind, and keeping it &s;till, till the
flame has gathered &s;trength. This fir&s;t
&s;ociety is called a Family. It is the root
of every other &s;ociety. It is the begin|ning
of order, and kind affections, and
mutual helpfulne&s;s and provident regu|lations.
If this &s;pring be pure, what
proceeds from it will be pure: if it be
polluted, the broader waters will be di&s;|coloured.
<HI>My child, love your family.</HI>
Its &s;trength is your &s;trength, its intere&s;ts
are your intere&s;ts; one &s;tream of life flows
through every member of it. You owe
much to your parents; my child, pay it
to your children; for this is the wi&s;e ap|pointment
and beautiful contrivance of
God, that &s;o man might never, at any
moment of his exi&s;tence, find him&s;elf
<PB N="7" REF="6">
&s;ingle, unconnected and free from obliga|tion;
that &s;o the relation of families might
not be broken off, but might be continued
through all generations in a lengthening
and perpetual chain. But, my child,
you are now grown older; your walks
are extended to all the clu&s;ter of hou&s;es
among&s;t which we live: you know the
inhabitants; every one of them takes you
by the hand, and bids you good-morrow
as you pa&s;s. You know every cop&s;e and
field, and pa&s;ture belonging to them; for
you have been with the old men of the
pari&s;h when they went to trace out and
mark the bounds of it. This then is the
next Society; the members of it are
town&s;men; they know each other, they
care for each other; the rich help the
poor, the poor work for the rich; they
are more united than &s;trangers. Now,
my child, if you travel on, you come to
<PB N="8" REF="7">
other towns, and fields and villages, and
others &s;till beyond them far, and further
than you can &s;ee, Ea&s;t and We&s;t, and North
and South, reaching on every &s;ide to the
great Ocean, and all the&s;e together make
up that large &s;ociety called a <HI>State;</HI> &s;o
large is it, that you mu&s;t &s;tretch your
imagination to conceive properly of its
extent; it contains thou&s;ands and thou|&s;ands
of families whom you never have
&s;een, nor probably ever will &s;ee; yet of
all this you are a part, and joined to it
in a mo&s;t intimate and binding connection,
like a limb to the body, or a &s;ingle &s;hoot
to a large tree. The&s;e are all governed
by the &s;ame rules; they &s;peak the &s;ame
language; they make war or peace to|gether.
<HI>My child, love your Country!</HI> it
contains all you love; all le&s;&s;er &s;ocieties,
of friends families and town&s;men, are in|cluded
in this va&s;t, this comprehen&s;ive
<PB N="9" REF="8">
community.&endq;&mdash;In this manner, my friends,
in&s;truct your children, and make the&s;e
important terms <HI>familiar in their mouths
as hou&s;hold names.</HI></P>
<P>If it be a&s;ked for what <HI>rea&s;ons</HI> men
a&s;&s;ociate in this large connection, con&s;ider
within your&s;elves for what rea&s;ons you
a&s;&s;ociate in &s;maller &s;ocieties. Con&s;ider
what &s;ervices you would wi&s;h from your
neighbours, and what advantages you
would expect from agreeing to live to|gether,
if you were to belong to no other
community than that of the little town|&s;hip
where you were about to &s;ettle your|&s;elves.&mdash;You
would wi&s;h, in the fir&s;t
place, that no one might hurt or do any
injury to his neighbour. You would not
have the &s;trong abu&s;e the weak. You
would wi&s;h that a woman or a young
child, &s;hould cro&s;s the green, or go to the
<PB N="10" REF="9">
neighbouring market, with as much &s;afety
as the &s;toute&s;t man among&s;t you. You
like to &s;leep in your beds, without being
di&s;turbed by ruffians; and you would
think it a &s;ad &s;tate of things if, when you
go out in the fields to work, you were
obliged to keep watch, and to &s;py anxiou&s;ly
into every wood and bye-lane, le&s;t troops
of robbers &s;hould fall upon you, and put
you to death, or carry you into &s;lavery.
You wi&s;h, therefore, in the fir&s;t place,
<HI>&s;ecurity to your per&s;ons.</HI> You further
wi&s;h, that when you have ploughed a
field, or laid down a meadow for hay,
your idle neighbour may not be permitted
to reap the corn you have &s;own; or to
turn in his cattle to trample down your
gra&s;s. You chu&s;e to enjoy the fruits of
your indu&s;try. You like to &s;ay, <HI>this is
mine;</HI> when you have wrought any thing
by your &s;kill, or produced it from the
<PB N="11" REF="10">
earth by your labour, or &s;aved it by your
oeconomy; and you feel that without this
encouragement you would not have &s;uffi|cient
motive for your exertions. You
wi&s;h therefore the <HI>&s;ecurity of property.</HI>
You wi&s;h further to have &s;ome general
rules, known and agreed to by all, by
which every one may conduct him&s;elf in
the intercour&s;es of life: you wi&s;h regula|tions
for your fairs and markets, e&s;tabli&s;hed
weights and mea&s;ures, and appointed days
for particular bu&s;ine&s;s. You wi&s;h then
<HI>Laws, and a Police.</HI> You wi&s;h for &s;ome
method of determining di&s;putes which
may ari&s;e; and of bringing to rea&s;on any
refractory member of the &s;ociety. You
wi&s;h then <HI>a Judicature.</HI> You would be
willing, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of you who are
in ea&s;y circum&s;tances, to &s;pare &s;omething
out of the produce of your &s;hop, or your
farm, for a common pur&s;e, in order to
<PB N="12" REF="11">
build a church, to make a road, to endow
a &s;chool, to erect a market-cro&s;s, to &s;ink
a well, or any the like u&s;eful works; or
even to make a bowling-green, or plant
a walk of trees, where you may a&s;&s;emble
with your families, and amu&s;e your&s;elves
when the labour of the day is over. You
wi&s;h then <HI>a revenue.</HI> Further, perceiving
that the&s;e excellent regulations you had
made would not execute them&s;elves, and
that what is every one's bu&s;ine&s;s is no
one's bu&s;ine&s;s, you would appoint &s;ome
one or more per&s;ons among&s;t you who&s;e
province it &s;hould be to &s;ee that all the&s;e
rules were ob&s;erved, and your money laid
out with faithfulne&s;s and judgment. As
the&s;e per&s;ons could not well look after
your bu&s;ine&s;s and their own too, you
would be willing to appoint them a &s;alary,
which might make them amends for their
time and trouble &s;pent upon your affairs;
<PB N="13" REF="12">
you would likewi&s;e contrive that by ap|pointing
men to attend them when their
office required it, they &s;hould always have
power enough to make your rules be
ob&s;erved, in &s;pite of all the re&s;i&s;tance of
ill-di&s;po&s;ed and licentious people. You
wi&s;h then <HI>ruling powers, and an executive
force.</HI>&mdash;And thus you would have formed,
almo&s;t without knowing it, that in&s;titu|tion
called <HI>Government:</HI> you would have
traced in miniature the &s;ame plan which,
with a larger outline, embraces the in|tere&s;ts
of States and Empires. It will
have been &s;ugge&s;ted to you, as every other
invention of man has been &s;ugge&s;ted to
him, by his wants; and therefore it is
that you will be at no lo&s;s to know its
u&s;es. Men &s;uffer from the cold, and they
contrive cloathing; they require &s;helter,
and they con&s;truct hou&s;es; they have
need of &s;ociety, and they form Govern|ments.
There is nothing of my&s;tery in
<PB N="14" REF="13">
this, nothing that requires to be wrapt
up in &s;trange and unintelligible terms;
the &s;teps are plain and ea&s;y; the benefits
are felt by all, and therefore it may be
comprehended by all.</P>
<P>It has been a&s;&s;erted by &s;ome, that if
men all were virtuous, there would be
no occa&s;ion for Government; this,
however, is far from being true. If
all men were virtuous, we &s;hould in|deed
want no pri&s;ons, no terrible exe|cutions,
no armed &s;oldiers, but we &s;hould
&s;till want Government, becau&s;e we &s;hould
want &s;ociety. Government is u&s;eful for
three things. Fir&s;t, for protection: every
man is protected with the force of every
man; no force can attack the &s;ubject of
the laws &s;o great as that which defends
him; even the man who ri&s;es to injure
him is made at the &s;ame time, by the
compelling force of Government, to con|tribute
<PB N="15" REF="14">
his &s;hare towards his defence.
Secondly, for managing tho&s;e affairs which
Societies have in common; when affairs
are too big for any private undertaking,
they are managed by the Society. By
Government the whole &s;trength of the
community is made to act together, like
a giant beam of &s;ome va&s;t machine which
plays with the complicated force of a
thou&s;and movements, and executes at
once what a number of &s;ingle arms would
attempt in vain. Thirdly, Government
is u&s;eful for regulating many things which
in them&s;elves are indifferent, but which,
in order to prevent di&s;putes, it is nece&s;&s;ary
to determine by &s;ome fixed and preci&s;e
rule. In &s;ome ca&s;es, the law tells you
what is right, and what is wrong; but
in &s;ome it <HI>makes</HI> the right and wrong.
I will try to explain this. Rea&s;on tells
us, that every man &s;hould enjoy the fruit of
<PB N="16" REF="15">
his own indu&s;try; but if a tenant finds in
his field a copper mine, or a coal-pit,
rea&s;on will not tell him whether it &s;hould
belong to him&s;elf, or to his landlord.
Rea&s;on will not tell him whether the
fi&s;h in the river ought to be in common,
or to belong to the occupier of the ground
on its banks: rea&s;on will &s;ay that his pro|perty
&s;hould be &s;ecured to him during his
life, but rea&s;on will not &s;ay in what pro|portions
it &s;hall be divided after his death
among&s;t his family; if indeed it will
&s;ecure its perpetual continuance there.
Yet the&s;e are circum&s;tances too important
to be left to the turbulent deci&s;ions of the
moment; they are therefore made the
object of law, and by this means a number
of ca&s;es are determined in a quiet and re|gular
manner, which, without &s;uch an au|thority
to appeal to, would occa&s;ion con|tinual
animo&s;ity and contention, <HI>becau&s;e</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="16">
no clear right could exi&s;t on either &s;ide.&mdash;The
larger and more flouri&s;hing any
Society is, the more occa&s;ion it has for
Government, becau&s;e it has more affairs
to manage in common, and more ca&s;es
to be determined by particular rules.
Along the va&s;t plains of the middle of A&s;ia
rove innumerable tribes of Shepherds,
leading their flocks from pa&s;ture to pa&s;ture,
and &s;ub&s;i&s;ting upon their milk and fle&s;h.
The&s;e require very little of Government,
for they have few common affairs to
manage; when their tents are &s;truck,
their towns are moved, and their whole
community unfixed. Few di&s;putes of
property can ari&s;e among&s;t them, beyond
the right to a well of purer water, or the
liberty of pitching their canva&s;s dwellings
in a meadow ground of richer pa&s;ture.
They have no public works, no exten&s;ive
<PB N="18" REF="17">
commerce, no navigation; Government
holds them with a loo&s;e and &s;light band
of connection; few of their actions are
re&s;trained. The divi&s;ion of tribes, in
which a kind of family government is
exerci&s;ed, an&s;wers to them all the ends of
a more complicated &s;cheme of legi&s;lation.
But it is not &s;o in &s;uch a community as
ours. We want much more of Society;
and therefore Government extends it&s;elf
to many of our mo&s;t common and in|different
actions. We want &s;ecurity for
various kinds of property, of the mo&s;t
delicate and complex nature: we want
provi&s;ion for our teachers; we want pro|vi&s;ion
for our poor, and in&s;truction for
them; we want armies and fleets for our
defence. You have &s;een a &s;hip, and you
know how very little way one day's work
of any of you would go towards com|pleating
<PB N="19" REF="18">
it: we want many &s;hips; we
want intercour&s;e with foreign nations.
We want &s;ome things for the pomp and
decent &s;plendor which becomes a great
and rich people; and all the&s;e affairs
mu&s;t be managed and directed by the
public act and con&s;ent.&mdash;We require
much of Government, and therefore it
lays us under many re&s;traints; re&s;traints
as unea&s;y and difficult to bear, to one not
accu&s;tomed to our &s;tate of &s;ociety, as the
fa&s;hion of our cloaths would be to the
half-naked Indian, that bounds along
without incumbrance among&s;t his native
plains. We bear the&s;e re&s;traints, becau&s;e
we think the advantages make it worth
while; there is no other rea&s;on.&mdash;Man,
feeble and defencele&s;s in thy&s;elf, rejoice
that thou art joined to a community!
Individuals, rejoice that you are gathered
<PB N="20" REF="19">
into a public! Its &s;trength becomes
your &s;trength, its riches your riches;
all its powers of defence to the la&s;t man
would be drawn out to &s;hield one of your
little infants from violence or oppre&s;&s;ion.
If a &s;ingle man were to attack one of you
who is &s;tout, he could perhaps defend
him&s;elf; but he could not re&s;i&s;t a band
of armed robbers. In countries where
there is no regular Government, there are
many &s;uch, who infe&s;t the roads, fall
upon and ma&s;&s;acre the peaceable inha|bitants,
burn the hou&s;es, and carry away
women and children into cruel &s;lavery;
the law protects you again&s;t &s;uch; the
law is &s;trong, becau&s;e you are weak; the
law is armed, to defend you who are naked
and unarmed. Citizens, expand your
minds to take in the&s;e ideas! Let your
Country occupy a large &s;pace in your
<PB N="21" REF="20">
minds! Love your Country; not merely
becau&s;e you fir&s;t drew breath in it, and
becau&s;e its fields, and woods, and rivers
are endeared by early plea&s;ures, and tender
recollections; though this too is agreeable
to our nature, and a &s;ource of fond and
exqui&s;ite delight; but becau&s;e it includes
every other object of love, becau&s;e it unites
all &s;eparate energies into one energy, all
&s;eparate wills into one will; and having
united and declared them, calls it Law.&mdash;Reverence
your&s;elves, for though but
a &s;mall part, &s;till you are a part of your
Country. In your&s;elves you are weak,
but in your Country you are &s;trong; in
your&s;elves you are ob&s;cure, but in your
Country you are celebrated; in your&s;elves
you are unlearned, but in your Country
you po&s;&s;e&s;s all &s;cience and all art; in your|&s;elves
you are defencele&s;s, but in your
<PB N="22" REF="21">
Country you are invincible; in your&s;elves
you are peri&s;hable, but in your Country
you prolong an honourable exi&s;tence from
age to age. Its &s;plendors are your &s;plen|dors,
its triumphs are your triumphs;
every active citizen has a right to &s;ay,
&startq;<HI>We</HI> did this,&endq; when any honourable
action is recorded of his Country. Love
then this Country; unite its idea with
that of your dome&s;tic comforts, of your
indu&s;trious exertions, of your &s;olemn
prayers; be ready for any &s;acrifice it may
require of you; and remember that as
each of you, however incon&s;iderable, is
benefited by your Country; &s;o your
Country, however exten&s;ive, is benefited
by every one of the lea&s;t of you, provided
he &s;incerely exerts him&s;elf for that
purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="22">
Having thus con&s;idered the u&s;es of
Government, you are prepared to &s;ee
every thing belonging to it from its true
centre and proper point of view; and
will be able to judge what is mi&s;hapen,
mon&s;trous, and out of proportion, and
what is well contrived, beautiful, and
harmonious. Government is a machine
con&s;tructed for a certain purpo&s;e. If any
one were to &s;hew you a machine with a
number of wheels, &s;prings and move|ments,
and was to a&s;k you to judge of its
con&s;truction, you would immediately en|quire
for what purpo&s;e it was intended;
for without &s;uch information you might
&s;ee indeed that there was a great deal of
mechani&s;m employed about it, but whe|ther
well or ill contrived you would not
be able to tell; for the proportion of every
work depends on the effect to be produced
<PB N="24" REF="23">
by it: a mill-wheel has not the &s;ame
proportion with a cart-wheel, nor a com|mon
hou&s;e the &s;ame proportions with a
Church, becau&s;e their <HI>ends</HI> are different.
Never lo&s;e &s;ight, therefore, of this truth,
that <HI>Government is an invention of man,
for the &s;ervice of men:</HI> carry this idea
along with you, and apply it, as the
Carpenter does his rule and &s;quare, not
only to the fairer and more &s;tately apart|ments,
but to every rece&s;s and abutment
and hang-to of the State. I do not &s;ay
that no difficulties will remain, for Go|vernment
is too noble an art not to have
its difficulties; but proportionally, few will
remain. All Politicians would be nearly
of a mind, if they were once agreed about
the end they are to have in view: but the
fact is, that in many States, I might &s;ay
mo&s;t, Government is an invention for the
<PB N="25" REF="24">
advantage of a <HI>few men,</HI> or perhaps of <HI>one
man,</HI> and con&s;equently for the oppre&s;&s;ion
and degradation of the re&s;t. I &s;uppo&s;e
you can be at no lo&s;s to determine which
of the&s;e ends is the mo&s;t de&s;ireable. You
need not con&s;ider long to be convinced,
that if happine&s;s be good, the more of it
there is in the world the better; and that
it is a nobler plan which contrives the
happine&s;s of all, than that which con|trives
the happine&s;s only of a part. If
then you agree with me in this opinion,
we will lay a&s;ide all the other plans of
Government as not to our purpo&s;e.
They may be very well contrived and
proportioned to an&s;wer the end they are
intended for, but it is not our end. We
do not think the happine&s;s of a few men
a &s;ufficient object; we want the happine&s;s
of all; for this plain rea&s;on, that all have
<PB N="26" REF="25">
an equal de&s;ire to be happy, and an equal
right to be &s;o.</P>
<P>It would &s;ave a great deal of unnece&s;&s;ary
trouble, if tho&s;e who pretend to explain
the wheels of any particular Government,
would tell you at once which of the&s;e
purpo&s;es it is intended for, for want of
which they cannot make the &s;everal
parts an&s;wer to their de&s;criptions, and are
as &s;trangely puzzled as a man would be
who &s;hould endeavour to explain to you
a pump, making you believe all the while
it was a machine to tell the hour of the
day; and then they find them&s;elves obliged
to &s;ay, that the machine is made with &s;uch
exqui&s;ite &s;kill, it is too difficult for any
but workmen to under&s;tand; whereas, if
they would fairly &s;ay, This Government
