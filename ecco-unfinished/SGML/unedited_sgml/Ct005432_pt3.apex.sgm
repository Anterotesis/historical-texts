<L>FATE gave the Word; the cruel arrow &s;ped;</L>
<L>And POPE lies number'd with the mighty Dead!</L>
<L>Re&s;ign'd he fell; &s;uperior to the dart,</L>
<L>That quench'd its rage in YOURS and BRITAIN'S Heart:</L>
<L>YOU mourn: but BRITAIN, lull'd in re&s;t profound,</L>
<L>(Uncon&s;cious Britain!) &s;lumbers o'er her wound.</L>
<L>Exulting Dulne&s;s ey'd the &s;etting Light,</L>
<L>And flapp'd her wing, impatient for the Night:</L>
<L>Rouz'd at the &s;ignal, Guilt collects her train,</L>
<L>And counts the Triumphs of her growing Reign:</L>

<L>Th' envenom'd Mon&s;ter &s;pit their deadly foam,</L>
<L>To bla&s;t the Laurel that &s;urrounds his Tomb.</L>

<L>And view that bright A&s;&s;emblage trea&s;ur'd there;</L>
<L>You trace the Chain that links his deep De&s;ign,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>IN ev'ry Brea&s;t there burns an active flame,</L>
<L N="30">The Love of Glory, or the Dread of Shame:</L>
<L>The Pa&s;&s;ion ONE, tho' various it appear,</L>
<L>As brighten'd into Hope, or dimm'd by Fear.</L>
<L>The li&s;ping Infant, and the hoary Sire,</L>

<L>The Charms of Prai&s;e the Coy, the Mode&s;t wooe,</L>

Haunts the proud City, and the lowly Shade,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus Heav'n in Pity wakes the friendly Flame,</L>
<L>To urge Mankind on Deeds that merit Fame:</L>
<L>But Man, vain Man, in folly only wi&s;e,</L>
<L>Rejects the Manna &s;ent him from the Skies:</L>
<L N="45">With rapture hears corrupted Pa&s;&s;ion's call,</L>
<L>Still proudly prone to mingle with the &s;tall.</L>
<L>As each deceitful &s;hadow tempts his view,</L>
<L>He for the <HI>imag'd</HI> Sub&s;tance quits the <HI>true;</HI></L>
<L>Eager to catch the vi&s;ionary Prize,</L>

<L>'Till madly zealous, impotently vain,</L>
<L>He forfeits ev'ry Prai&s;e he pants to gain.</L>

<L>Thus &s;till imperious NATURE plies her part;</L>
<L>And &s;till her Dictates work in ev'ry heart.</L>
<L N="55">Each Pow'r that &s;ov'reign Nature bids enjoy,</L>
<L>Man may corrupt, but Man can ne'er de&s;troy.</L>
<L>Like mighty rivers, with re&s;i&s;tle&s;s force</L>
<L>The Pa&s;&s;ions rage, ob&s;tructed in their cour&s;e;</L>
<L>Swell to new heights, forbidden paths explore,</L>

<L>Like the arm'd BEE, with art mo&s;t &s;ubtly true,</L>

<HEAD>THE DESIGN.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING propo&s;ed to write &s;ome pieces on Hu|man Life and Manners, &s;uch as (to u&s;e my lord Bacon's expre&s;&s;ion) <HI>come home to Men's Bu&s;ine&s;s and Bo|&s;oms,</HI> I thought it more &s;atisfactory to begin with con|&s;idering <HI>Man</HI> in the ab&s;tract, his <HI>Nature</HI> and his <HI>State;</HI> &s;ince, to prove any moral duty, to enforce any moral precept, or to examine the perfection or imperfection of any creature what&s;oever, it is nece&s;&s;ary fir&s;t to know what <HI>condition</HI> and <HI>relation</HI> it is placed in, and what is the proper <HI>end</HI> and <HI>purpo&s;e</HI> of its <HI>being.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;cience of Human Nature is, like all other &s;ciences, reduced to a <HI>few clear points:</HI> There are not <HI>many certain truths</HI> in this world. It is therefore in the Anatomy of the mind as in that of the Body; more good will accrue to mankind by attending to the large, open, and perceptible parts, than by &s;tudying too much &s;uch finer nerves and ve&s;&s;els, the conformations and u&s;es of which will for ever e&s;cape our ob&s;ervation. The <HI>di&s;putes</HI> are all upon the&s;e la&s;t, and, I will venture to &s;ay, they have le&s;s &s;harpened the <HI>wits</HI> than the <HI>hearts</HI> of men again&s;t each other, and have dimini&s;hed the practice, more than advanced the theory, of Morality. If I could flatter my&s;elf that this E&s;&s;ay has any merit, it is in &s;teering betwixt the extremes of doctrines &s;eem|ingly oppo&s;ite, in pa&s;&s;ing over terms utterly unintelli|gible, and in forming a <HI>temperate</HI> yet not <HI>incon&s;i&s;tent,</HI> and a <HI>&s;hort</HI> yet not <HI>imperfect</HI> &s;y&s;tem of Ethics.</P>
<P>This I might have done in pro&s;e; but I cho&s;e ver&s;e, and even rhyme, for two rea&s;ons. The one will ap|pear obvious; that principles, maxims, or precepts &s;o written, both &s;trike the reader more &s;trongly at fir&s;t,
<PB REF="38">
and are more ea&s;ily retained by him afterwards: The other may &s;eem odd, but is true, I found I could ex|pre&s;s them more <HI>&s;hortly</HI> this way than in pro&s;e it&s;elf; and nothing is more certain, than that much of the <HI>force</HI> as well as <HI>grace</HI> of arguments or in&s;tructions, de|pends on their <HI>conci&s;ene&s;s.</HI> I was unable to treat this part of my &s;ubject more in <HI>detail,</HI> without becoming dry and tedious; or more <HI>poetically,</HI> without &s;acrificing per&s;picuity to ornament, without wandring from the preci&s;ion, or breaking the chain of rea&s;oning: If any man can unite all the&s;e without diminution of any of them, I freely confe&s;s he will compa&s;s a thing above my capacity.</P>
<P>What is now publi&s;hed, is only to be con&s;idered as a <HI>general Map</HI> of MAN, marking out no more than the <HI>greater parts,</HI> their <HI>extent,</HI> their <HI>limits,</HI> and their <HI>con|nection,</HI> but leaving the particular to be more fully de|lineated in the charts which are to follow. Con&s;equent|ly, the&s;e Epi&s;tles in their progre&s;s (if I have health and lei&s;ure to make any progre&s;s) will be le&s;s dry, and more &s;u&s;ceptible of poetical ornament. I am here only opening the <HI>fountains,</HI> and clearing the pa&s;&s;age. To deduce the <HI>rivers,</HI> to follow them in their cour&s;e, and to ob&s;erve their effects, may be a ta&s;k more agree|able.</P>

<HEAD>COMMENTARY.</HEAD>
<P>THE Opening of this poem, in fifteen lines, is taken up in giving an account of the Subje&cacute;t; which, agreeably to the title, is an ESSAY on MAN, or a Philo&s;ophical Enquiry into his <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>End,</HI> his <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions</HI> and <HI>Pur&s;uits.</HI></P>
<P>The Exordium relates to the whole work, of which the <HI>E&s;&s;ay on Man</HI> was only the fir&s;t book. The 6th, 7th, and 8th lines allude to the &s;ubjects of this <HI>E&s;&s;ay,</HI> viz. the general Order and De&s;ign of Providence; the Con&s;titution of the human Mind; the origin, u&s;e, and end of the Pa&s;&s;ions and Affections, both &s;elfi&s;h and &s;ocial; and the wrong pur&s;uits of Power, Plea&s;ure, and Happine&s;s. The 10th, 11th, 12th, &amp;c. have relation to the &s;ubjects of the books intended to follow, <HI>viz.</HI> the Characters and Capacities of Men, and the Limits of Learning and Ignorance. The 13th and 14th, to the Knowledge of Mankind, and the various Manners of the age.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="43">
Next, in line 16, he tells us with what de&s;ign he wrote, <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q><L>To vindicate the ways of God to Man.</L></Q>
The Men he writes again&s;t, he frequently informs us, are &s;uch as <HI>weigh their opinion again&s;t Providence</HI> (&vers; 114) &s;uch as <HI>cry, if Man's unhappy, God's unju&s;t</HI> (&vers; 118) or &s;uch as fall into the notion, <HI>that Vice and Virtue there is none at all</HI> (Ep. ii. &vers; 212) This occa&s;ions the poet to divide his vindication of the ways of God into two parts. In the fir&s;t of which he gives direct an&s;wers to tho&s;e objections which libertine Men, on a view of the di&s;orders ari&s;ing from the perver&s;ity of the human will, have in|tended again&s;t Providence. And in the &s;econd, he obviates all tho&s;e objections, by a true delineation of human Nature; or a general, but exact, <HI>map of Man.</HI> The fir&s;t epi&s;tle is employed in the management of the fir&s;t part of this di&s;pute; and the
<PB N="5" REF="44">
three following in the management of the &s;econd. So that this whole book con&s;titutes a complete <HI>E&s;&s;ay on Man,</HI> written for the be&s;t purpo&s;e, <HI>to vindicate the ways of God.</HI></P>
<P>VER. 17. <HI>Say fir&s;t, of God above, or Man below, &amp;c.]</HI> The poet having declared his <HI>Subject,</HI> his <HI>End of writing,</HI> and the <HI>Quality of his Adver&s;aries,</HI> proceeds (from &vers; 16 to 23) to in|&s;truct us, <HI>from whence</HI> he intends to draw his arguments; namely, from the <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> things of God in this &s;y&s;tem to demon&s;trate the <HI>invi&s;ible</HI> things of God, his <HI>eternal Power</HI> and <HI>God-head:</HI> And
<PB N="6" REF="45" MS="Y">
<HI>why?</HI> becau&s;e we can <HI>rea&s;on only from what we know,</HI> and as we <HI>know</HI> no more of <HI>Man</HI> than what we &s;ee of his &s;tation here; &s;o we know no more of <HI>God</HI> than what we &s;ee of his di&s;pen&s;a|tions in this &s;tation; being able to trace him no further than to the limits of our own &s;y&s;tem. This naturally leads the poet to ex|probrate the mi&s;erable Folly and Impiety of pretending to pry into, and call in que&s;tion the profound di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence: Which reproof contains (from &vers; 22 to 43) a &s;ublime de&s;cription of the Omni&s;cience of God, and the mi&s;erable Blindne&s;s and Pre&s;umption of Man.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="46">
VER. 43. <HI>Of &s;y&s;tems po&s;&s;ible,</HI> &amp;c.] So far his mode&s;t and &s;o|ber Introduction; in which he truly ob&s;erves, that no wi&s;dom le&s;s than omni&s;cient
<Q><L>Can tell why Heav'n <HI>has</HI> made us as we are.</L></Q>
Yet, though we cannot di&s;cover the <HI>particular</HI> rea&s;ons for this mode of our exi&s;tence, we may be a&s;&s;ured in <HI>general</HI> that it is <HI>right.</HI> For now, entering upon his argument, he lays down this &s;elf-evident propo&s;ition as the foundation of his The&s;is,
<PB N="8" REF="47" MS="Y">
which he rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;es will be allowed him, <HI>That, of all po&s;&s;ible &s;y&s;tems, infinite wi&s;dom hath formed the be&s;t</HI> (&vers; 43, 44) From whence he draws two con&s;equences:</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> (from &vers; 44 to 51) is, that as the be&s;t &s;y&s;tem can|not but be &s;uch a one as hath no inconnected Void; &s;uch a one in which there is a perfect coherence and gradual &s;ubordi|nation in all its parts; there mu&s;t needs be, in &s;ome part or other of the &s;cale of rea&s;oning life, &s;uch a creature as MAN: Which reduces the di&s;pute to this ab&s;urd que&s;tion, <HI>Whether God has placed him wrong?</HI></P>
<P>VER. 51. <HI>Re&s;pecting Man,</HI> &amp;c.] It being &s;hewn that MAN, <HI>the Subject of his enquiry,</HI> has a nece&s;&s;ary place in &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem as this is confe&s;&s;ed to be; and it being evident, that the abu&s;e of Free-will, from whence proceeds all moral evil, is the cer|tain effect of &s;uch a creature's exi&s;tence; the next que&s;tion will be, How the&s;e evils can be accounted for, con&s;i&s;tently with the idea we have of God's attributes? Therefore,</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>&s;econd</HI> con&s;equence he draws from his principle, <HI>That of all po&s;&s;ible &s;y&s;tems, infinite wi&s;dom has formed the be&s;t,</HI> is, that whatever is wrong in our private &s;y&s;tem, is right as rela|tive to the whole:</P>
<Q><L>Re&s;pecting Man, whatever wrong we call,</L>
<L><HI>May, mu&s;t</HI> be right, as relative to <HI>ALL.</HI></L></Q>
<P>That it <HI>may,</HI> he proves (from &vers; 52 to 61) by &s;hewing in what con&s;i&s;ts the difference between the <HI>&s;y&s;tematic</HI> works of God,
<PB N="9" REF="48">
and tho&s;e of Man; <HI>viz.</HI> that, in the latter, a thou&s;and move|ments &s;carce gain one purpo&s;e; in the former, one movement gains many purpo&s;es. So that
<Q><L>&mdash;Man, who here &s;eems <HI>principal</HI> alone,</L>
<L>Perhaps acts <HI>&s;econd</HI> to &s;ome &s;phere unknown.</L></Q>
And acting thus, the appearances of <HI>wrong</HI> in the <HI>partial</HI> &s;y&s;tem, may be <HI>right</HI> in the <HI>univer&s;al:</HI> For
<Q><L>'Tis but a part we &s;ee, and not a whole.</L></Q>
That it <HI>mu&s;t,</HI> the whole body of this epi&s;tle is employed to il|lu&s;trate and inforce. Thus <HI>partial Evil is univer&s;al Good;</HI> and thus Providence is fairly acquitted.</P>
<P>VER. 61. <HI>When the proud &s;teed</HI> &amp;c.] From all this he draws a general conclu&s;ion (from &vers; 60 to 91) that, as what has been &s;aid is &s;ufficient to vindicate the ways of Providence, Man &s;hould re&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and content, and confe&s;s every thing to be di&s;po&s;ed for the be&s;t; that to pretend to enquire into the <HI>manner</HI> how God conducts this wonderful &s;cheme to its com|pletion, is as ab&s;urd as to imagine that the hor&s;e and ox &s;hall
<PB N="10" REF="49" MS="Y">
ever come to comprehend why they undergo &s;uch different <HI>ma|nage</HI> and <HI>fortunes</HI> in the hand of Man; nay, that &s;uch know|ledge, if communicated, would be even <HI>pernicious</HI> to Man, and
<PB N="11" REF="50">
make him <HI>neglect</HI> or <HI>de&s;ert</HI> his Duty here. This he illu&s;trates by an in&s;tance in the lamb, which is happy in not knowing the fate that attends it from the butcher; and from thence takes
<PB N="12" REF="51">
occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, that God is the equal ma&s;ter of all his creatures, and provides for the proper happine&s;s of <HI>each</HI> being.</P>
<P>VER. 91. <HI>Hope humbly then;</HI> &amp;c.] But now the objector is &s;uppo&s;ed to put in, and &s;ay, You tell us indeed, that all things will terminate in good; but we &s;ee our&s;elves &s;urrounded with pre&s;ent Evil; and yet you forbid us all inquiry into the manner how we are to be extricated; and, in a word, leave us in a very di&s;con&s;olate condition. Not &s;o, replies the poet, you may rea&s;onably, if you &s;o plea&s;e, receive much comfort from the HOPE of a happy futurity; a <HI>Hope</HI> implanted in the human brea&s;t for this very purpo&s;e by God him&s;elf, as an earne&s;t of that Bli&s;s, which here perpetually flying us, is re&s;erved for the good Man hereafter. The rea&s;on why the poet chu&s;es to in&s;i&s;t on this proof of a future &s;tate, in preference to others, is in order to give his &s;y&s;tem (which is founded in a &s;ublime and improved <HI>Platoni&s;m)</HI> the higher grace of uniformity. For HOPE was <HI>Plato's</HI> peculiar argument for a future &s;tate; and the words here employed&mdash;<HI>the &s;oul unea&s;y</HI> &amp;c. his particular ex|pre&s;&s;ion. The poet in this place, therefore, &s;ays in expre&s;s terms, that <HI>God gave us Hope to &s;upply that future bli&s;s, which he at pre&s;ent keeps hid from us.</HI> In his &s;econd epi&s;tle, &vers; 274, he goes &s;till farther, and &s;ays, this HOPE quits us not even at Death, when every thing mortal drops from us:
<Q><L>Hope travels thro', nor quits us when we die.</L></Q>
And, in the fourth epi&s;tle, he &s;hews how the &s;ame HOPE is a <HI>proof</HI> of a future &s;tate, from the con&s;ideration of God's giving man no appetite in vain, or what he did not intend &s;hould be &s;atisfied;</P>
<LG>
<L>He &s;ees, why Nature plants in Man alone</L>
<L>Hope of known bli&s;s, and Faith in bli&s;s unknown:</L>

<P>That the reader may &s;ee in one view the Exactne&s;s of the Method, as well as Force of the Argument, I &s;hall here draw up a &s;hort &s;ynop&s;is of this Epi&s;tle. The poet begins by telling us his &s;ubject is an E&s;&s;ay on Man: That his end of writing is <HI>to vindicate Providence:</HI> That he intends to derive his argu|ments, <HI>from the vi&s;ible things of God &s;een in this &s;y&s;tem:</HI> Lays down this Propo&s;ition, <HI>That of all po&s;&s;ible &s;y&s;tems infinite Wi&s;dom has form'd the be&s;t:</HI> draws from thence two Con&s;equences, 1. <HI>That there mu&s;t needs be &s;omewhere &s;uch a creature as Man;</HI> 2. <HI>That the moral Evil which he is author of, is productive of the Good of the Whole.</HI> This is his general The&s;is; from whence he forms this Conclu&s;ion, <HI>That Man &s;hould re&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and content, and make the hopes of Futurity his comfort; but not &s;uffer this to be the occa&s;ion of</HI> PRIDE, which is the cau&s;e of all his impious complaints.</P>

<P>But now admitting, for ar|gument's &s;ake, there was an ambiguity in the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, &s;o great, as that a Spinozi&s;t might employ them to expre&s;s his own particular principles; and &s;uch a thing might well be, becau&s;e the Spinozi&s;ts, in order to hide the impiety of their principle, are u&s;ed to ex|pre&s;s the Omnipre&s;ence of God in terms that any religi|ous Thei&s;t might employ. In this ca&s;e, I &s;ay, how are we to judge of the poet's mean|ing? Surely by the whole tenor of his argument. Now take the words in the &s;en&s;e of the Spinozi&s;ts, and he is made, in the conclu&s;ion of his epi&s;tle, to overthrow all he has been advancing throughout the body of it: For Spinozi&s;m is the de|&s;truction of an Univer&s;e, where every thing tends, by a fore|&s;een contrivance in all its parts, to the perfection of the whole. But allow him to employ the pa&s;&s;age in the &s;en&s;e of St. Paul, <HI>That we and all creatures live and move and have our being in God;</HI> and then it will be &s;een to be the mo&s;t logical &s;upport of all that had preceded. For the poet having, as we &s;ay, laboured through his epi&s;tle to prove, that every thing in the Univer&s;e tends, by a fore&s;een contrivance, and a pre&s;ent di|rection of all its parts, to the perfection of the whole; it might be objected, that &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition of things implying in God a painful, opero&s;e, and inconceivable extent of Pro|vidence, it could not be &s;up|po&s;ed that &s;uch care extended to <HI>all,</HI> but was confined to the more noble parts of the crea|tion. This gro&s;s conception of the Fir&s;t Cau&s;e the poet ex|po&s;es, by &s;hewing that God is equally and intimately pre&s;ent to every particle of Matter, to every &s;ort of Sub&s;tance, and in every in&s;tant of Being.</P>

&s;ome of the&s;e judges, taken and condemned for the action which he had own|ed to be right, he mu&s;t have cried out <HI>this is doubly right.&endq;</HI></Q> Never was any thing more a|mazing than that the ab&s;urdi|ties ari&s;ing from the &s;en&s;e in which this critic takes the grand principle, of <HI>whatever is, is right,</HI> did not &s;hew him his mi&s;take: For could any one in his &s;en&s;es employ a propo&s;ition in a meaning from whence &s;uch evident ab&s;ur|dities <HI>immediately</HI> ari&s;e? I have ob&s;erved, that this conclu&s;ion, <HI>whatever is, is right,</HI> is a con|&s;equence of the&s;e premi&s;&s;es, that <HI>partial Evil tends to uni|ver&s;al Good;</HI> which the au|thor employs as a principle to humble the pride of Man, who would impiou&s;ly make God accountable for his creation. What then does common &s;en&s;e teach us to under&s;tand by <HI>what|ever is, is right?</HI> Did the poet mean right with regard to Man, or right with regard to God; right with regard to it|&s;elf, or right with regard to its ultimate tendency? Surely WITH REGARD TO GOD; for he tells us his de&s;ign is to <HI>vindicate the ways of God to Man.</HI> Surely, with regard to its ULTIMATE TENDENCY; for he tells us again, <HI>all par|tial ill is univer&s;al good,</HI> &vers; 291. Now is this any encouragement to Vice? Or does it take off from the crime of him who commits it, that God provi|dentially produces Good out of Evil? Had Mr. Pope ab|ruptly &s;aid in his conclu&s;ion, <HI>the re&s;ult of all is, that what|ever is, is right,</HI> the objector had even then been inexcu&s;a|ble for putting &s;o ab&s;urd a &s;en&s;e upon the words, when he might have &s;een that it was a conclu&s;ion from the general principle abovementioned; and therefore mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have another meaning.

<HEAD>COMMENTARY.</HEAD>
<P>VER. 2. <HI>The proper &s;tudy</HI> &amp;c.] The poet having &s;hewn, in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> epi&s;tle, that the <HI>Ways of God</HI> are too high for our com|prehen&s;ion, rightly draws this conclu&s;ion: and methodically makes it the &s;ubject of his Introduction to the <HI>&s;econd,</HI> which treats of the <HI>Nature of Man.</HI></P>
<P>But here immediately the accu&s;ers of Providence would be apt to object, and &s;ay, Admit that we had run into an exce&s;s, while we pretended to cen&s;ure or penetrate the de&s;igns of Pro|vidence, a matter indeed too high for us; yet have you gone as far into the oppo&s;ite extreme, while you only &s;end us to the
<PB N="40" REF="82">
knowledge of our own Nature: You mu&s;t mock us when you talk of this as a &s;tudy; for &s;ure we are intimately acquainted with OURSELVES. The proper conclu&s;ion therefore from your demon&s;tration of our inability to comprehend the ways of God, is, that we &s;hould turn our&s;elves to the &s;tudy of the frame of NATURE. Thus, I &s;ay, would they be apt to object; for, of all Men, tho&s;e who call them&s;elves <HI>Free-thinkers</HI> are mo&s;t given up to <HI>Pride;</HI> e&s;pecially that kind of it, which con&s;i&s;ts in a boa&s;ted knowledge of their own nature, the effects of which are &s;o well
<PB N="41" REF="83">
expo&s;ed in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Epi&s;tle. The poet, therefore, to convince them that this &s;tudy is le&s;s ea&s;y than they imagine, replies (from &vers; 2 to 19) to the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> part of the objection, by de&s;cribing the dark and feeble &s;tate of the human Under&s;tanding, with regard to the knowledge of our&s;elves. And farther, to &s;trengthen this ar|gument, he &s;hews, in an&s;wer to the <HI>&s;econd</HI> part of the objection (from &vers; 18 to 31) that the highe&s;t advances in <HI>natural know|ledge</HI> may be ea&s;ily acquired, and yet we, all the while, con|tinue very ignorant of <HI>our&s;elves.</HI> For that neither the cleare&s;t &s;cience, which re&s;ults from the Newtonian philo&s;ophy, nor the mo&s;t &s;ublime, which is taught by the Platonic, will at all a&s;&s;i&s;t us in this &s;elf-&s;tudy; nay, what is more, that Religion it&s;elf, when grown fanatical and enthu&s;ia&s;tic, will be equally u&s;ele&s;s: Though pure and &s;ober Religion will be&s;t in&s;truct us in Man's Nature, that knowledge being e&s;&s;ential to Religion, who&s;e &s;ub|ject is Man con&s;idered in all his relations; and, con&s;equently, who&s;e object is God.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="87" MS="Y">
VER. 31. <HI>Superior beings,</HI> &amp;c.] To give this &s;econd argu|ment its full force, he illu&s;trates it (from &vers; 30 to 43) by the noble&s;t example that ever was in &s;cience, the incomparable NEWTON; who, although he penetrated &s;o far beyond others into the works of GOD, yet could go no farther in the know|ledge of his own nature than the generality of his fellows. Of which the poet a&s;&s;igns this very ju&s;t and adequate rea&s;on: In all <HI>other &s;ciences</HI> the Under&s;tanding is unchecked and uncon|trouled by any oppo&s;ite principle; but in the &s;cience of <HI>Man,</HI> the Pa&s;&s;ions overturn as fa&s;t as Rea&s;on can build up.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="89">
VER. 43. <HI>Trace Science then,</HI> &amp;c.] The conclu&s;ion, there|fore, from the whole is (from &vers; 42 to 53) that, as on the one
<PB N="48" REF="90">
hand, we &s;hould per&s;i&s;t in the &s;tudy of Nature; &s;o, on the other, in order to arrive at Science, we &s;hould proceed in the &s;impli|city of Truth; and the product, tho' &s;mall, will yet be real.</P>
<P>VER. 53. <HI>Two Principles,</HI> &amp;c.] The poet having thus &s;hewn the difficulty attending the &s;tudy of Man, proceeds to remove it, by laying before us the elements or true principles of this &s;cience, in an account of the <HI>Origin, U&s;e,</HI> and <HI>End</HI> of the PAS|SIONS; which, in my opinion, contains the true&s;t, cleare&s;t, &s;horte&s;t, and con&s;equently the be&s;t &s;y&s;tem of Ethics that is any
<PB N="49" REF="91">
where to be met with. He begins (from &vers; 52 to 59) with point|ing out the two grand principles in human nature, SELF-LOVE and REASON. De&s;cribes their general nature: The fir&s;t &s;ets Man upon acting, the other regulates his action. However, the&s;e principles are <HI>natural,</HI> not <HI>moral;</HI> and, therefore, in them|&s;elves, neither good nor bad, but &s;o only as they are directed. This ob&s;ervation is made with great judgment, in oppo&s;ition to the de&s;perate &s;olly of tho&s;e fanatics, who, as the A&s;cetic, pre|tend to eradicate Self-love; as the My&s;tic, would &s;tifle Rea|&s;on; and both, on the ab&s;urd fancy of their being moral, not natural principles.</P>
<P>VER. 59. <HI>Self-love, the &s;pring of motion, acts the &s;oul;]</HI> The poet proceeds (from &vers; 58 to 67) more minutely to mark out the di&s;tinct offices of the&s;e two principles, which he had before a&s;&s;igned only in general; and here he &s;hews their nece&s;&s;ity; for without Self-love, as the <HI>&s;pring,</HI> Man would be unactive; and without Rea&s;on, as the <HI>balance,</HI> active no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="92">
VER. 67. <HI>Mo&s;t &s;trength the moving principle requires;]</HI> Having thus explained the ends and offices of each principle, he goes on (from &vers; 66 to 79) to &s;peak of their qualities; and &s;hews how they are fitted to di&s;charge tho&s;e functions, and an&s;wer their re&s;pective intentions. The bu&s;ine&s;s of Self-love being to excite to action, it is quick and impetuous; and moving in&s;tinctively, has, like attraction, its force prodigiou&s;ly increa&s;ed as the object approaches, and proportionably le&s;&s;ened as that recedes. On the contrary, Rea&s;on, like the Author of attraction, is always calm and &s;edate, and equally pre&s;erves it&s;elf, whether the object be near, or far off. Hence the moving principle is made more &s;trong, though the re&s;training be more quick-&s;ighted. The con&s;equence he draws from this is, that if we would not be carried away to our de&s;truction, we mu&s;t always keep Rea&s;on upon guard.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="93">
VER. 79. <HI>Attention,</HI> &amp;c.] But it would be objected, that, if this account were true, human life would be mo&s;t mi&s;erable; and, even in the wi&s;e&s;t, a perpetual conflict between Rea&s;on and the Pa&s;&s;ions. To this, therefore, the poet replies (from &vers; 78 to 81) fir&s;t, that Providence has &s;o graciou&s;ly contrived, that even in the voluntary exerci&s;e of Rea&s;on, as in the mere mechanic motion of a limb, Habit makes what was at fir&s;t done with pain, ea&s;y and natural. And, &s;econdly, that the experience gained by the long exerci&s;e of Rea&s;on, goes a great way towards eluding the force of Self-love. Now the attending to Rea&s;on, as here recommended, will gain us this habit and experience. Hence it appears, that this &s;tation, in which Rea&s;on is to be kept con&s;tantly upon guard, is not &s;o unea&s;y a one as may be at fir&s;t imagined.</P>
<P>VER. 81. <HI>Let &s;ubtle &s;choolmen</HI> &amp;c.] From this de&s;cription of Self-love and Rea&s;on it follows, as the poet ob&s;erves (from &vers; 80 to 93) that both con&s;pire to one end, namely, human hap|pine&s;s, though they be not equally expert in the choice of the means; the difference being this, that the fir&s;t ha&s;tily &s;eizes
<PB N="52" REF="94">
every thing which hath the appearance of good; the other weighs and examines whether it <HI>be indeed</HI> what it appears.</P>
<P>This &s;hews, as he next ob&s;erves, the folly of the &s;choolmen, who con&s;ider them as two oppo&s;ite principles, the one good and the other evil. The ob&s;ervation is &s;ea&s;onable and judicious; for this dangerous &s;chool-opinion gives great &s;upport to the Mani|chean or Zoroa&s;tran error, the confutation of which was one of the author's chief ends in writing. For if there be <HI>two prin|ciples</HI> in Man, a <HI>good</HI> and <HI>bad,</HI> it is natural to think him the joint product of the two Manichean deities (the fir&s;t of which contributed to his <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> the other to his <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions)</HI> rather than the creature of one Individual Cau&s;e. This was Plutarch's notion, and, as we may &s;ee in him, of the more ancient Mani|cheans. It was of importance, therefore, to reprobrate and &s;ubvert a notion that &s;erved to the &s;upport of &s;o dangerous an error: And this the poet has done with more force and clear|ne&s;s than is often to be found in whole volumes written again&s;t that heretical opinion.</P>
<P>VER. 93. <HI>Modes of Self-love</HI> &amp;c.] Having given this ac|count of the nature of Self-love in general, he comes now to anatomize it, in a di&s;cour&s;e on the PASSIONS, which he aptly names the <HI>modes</HI> of Self-love. The object of all the&s;e, he &s;hews (from &vers; 92 to 101) is good; and, when under the guidance of Rea&s;on, real good, either of our&s;elves or of another; for &s;ome goods not being capable of divi&s;ion or communication, and Rea&s;on at the &s;ame time directing us to provide for our&s;elves,
<PB N="53" REF="95">
we therefore, in pur&s;uit of the&s;e objects, &s;ometimes aim at our own good, &s;ometimes at the good of others: when fairly aim|ing at our own, the quality is called <HI>Prudence,</HI> when at an|other's, <HI>Virtue.</HI></P>
<P>Hence (as he &s;hews from &vers; 100 to 105) appears the folly of the Stoics, who would eradicate the Pa&s;&s;ions, things &s;o nece&s;&s;ary both to the good of the Individual and of the Kind. Which prepo&s;terous method of promoting Virtue he therefore very rea|&s;onably reproves.</P>
<P>VER. 105. <HI>The ri&s;ing tempe&s;t puts in act the &s;oul,]</HI> But as it was from ob&s;ervation of the evils occa&s;ioned by the Pa&s;&s;ions, that the Stoics thus extravagantly projected their extirpation, the poet recurs (from &vers; 104 to 111) to his grand principle, &s;o often before, and to &s;o good purpo&s;e, in&s;i&s;ted on, that <HI>partial Ill is uni|ver&s;al Good;</HI> and &s;hews, that though the tempe&s;t of the Pa&s;|&s;ions, like that of the air, may tear and ravage &s;ome few parts of nature in its pa&s;&s;age, yet the &s;alutary agitation produced by it pre&s;erves the whole in life and vigour. This is his <HI>fir&s;t</HI> argument again&s;t the Stoics, which he illu&s;trates by
<PB N="54" REF="96">
a very beautiful &s;imilitude, on a hint taken from Scripture:</P>
<Q><L>Nor God alone in the &s;till calm we find,</L>
<L>He mounts the &s;torm, and walks upon the wind.</L></Q>
<P>VER. 111. <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions, like Elements,</HI> &amp;c.] His <HI>&s;econd</HI> argument again&s;t the Stoics (from &vers; 110 to 133) is, that Pa&s;&s;ions go to the compo&s;ition of a moral character, ju&s;t as elementary parti|cles go to the compo&s;ition of an organized body: Therefore, for Man to project the de&s;truction of what compo&s;es his very Being, is the height of extravagance. 'Tis true, he tells us,
<PB N="55" REF="97">
that the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions, which, in their natural &s;tate, like elements, are in perpetual jar, mu&s;t be tempered, &s;oftened, and united, in order to perfect the work of the great pla&s;tic Arti&s;t; who, in this office, employs human Rea&s;on; who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to fol|low the road of Nature, and to ob&s;erve the dictates of the Deity; <HI>Follow her and God.</HI> The u&s;e and importance of this precept is evident: For in doing the fir&s;t, &s;he will di&s;cover the ab&s;urdity of attempting to eradicate the Pa&s;&s;ions; in doing the &s;econd, &s;he will learn how to make them &s;ub&s;ervient to the in|tere&s;t of Virtue.</P>
<P>VER. 123. <HI>Plea&s;ures are ever in our hands or eyes;]</HI> His <HI>third</HI> argument again&s;t the Stoics (from &vers; 122 to 127) is, that the Pa&s;&s;ions are a continual &s;pur to the pur&s;uit of Happine&s;s; which, without the&s;e powerful inciters, we &s;hould neglect, and &s;ink into a &s;en&s;ele&s;s indolence. Now Happine&s;s is the end of our
<PB N="56" REF="98">
creation; and this excitement the means of Happine&s;s; there|fore, the&s;e movers, the Pa&s;&s;ions, are the in&s;truments of God, which he hath put into the hands of Rea&s;on to work withal.</P>
<P>VER. 127. <HI>All &s;pread their charms,</HI> &amp;c.] The poet now pro|ceeds in his &s;ubject; and this la&s;t ob&s;ervation leads him natu|rally to the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of his next principle. He &s;hews then, that though all the Pa&s;&s;ions have their turn in &s;waying the deter|minations of the mind, yet every Man hath one MASTER PASSION that at length &s;tifles or ab&s;orbs all the re&s;t. The fact he illu&s;trates at large in his epi&s;tle to Lord Cobham. Here (from &vers; 126 to 149) he giveth us the cau&s;e of it. Tho&s;e Plea&s;ures or Goods, which are the objects of the Pa&s;&s;ions, affect the mind by &s;triking on the &s;en&s;es; but, as through the formation of the organs of our frame, every man hath &s;ome one &s;en&s;e &s;tronger and more acute than others, the object which &s;trikes that &s;tronger or acuter &s;en&s;e, whatever it be, will be the object mo&s;t de&s;ired; and con&s;equently, the pur&s;uit of that will be the <HI>ruling Pa&s;&s;ion.</HI> That the difference of force in this ruling Pa&s;&s;ion &s;hall, at fir&s;t, perhaps, be very &s;mall or even imperceptible; but Nature, Ha|bit, Imagination, Wit, nay even Rea&s;on it&s;elf &s;hall a&s;&s;i&s;t its growth, 'till it hath at length drawn and converted every other into it&s;elf. All which is delivered in a &s;train of Poetry &s;o won|derfully
<PB N="57" REF="99">
&s;ublime, as &s;u&s;pends, for a while, the <HI>ruling pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> in every Reader, and engro&s;&s;es his whole Admiration.</P>
<P>This naturally leads the poet to lament the weakne&s;s and in|&s;ufficiency of human Rea&s;on (from &vers; 148 to 161) and the pur|po&s;e he had in &s;o doing, was plainly to intimate the nece&s;&s;ity of a more perfect di&s;pen&s;ation to Mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="101">
VER. 161. <HI>Yes, Nature's road</HI> &amp;c.] Now as it appears, from the account here given of the <HI>ruling Pa&s;&s;ion</HI> and its cau&s;e which re&s;ults from the &s;tructure of the organs, that it is the road of Na|ture, the poet &s;hews (from &vers; 160 to 167) that this road is to be followed. So that the office of Rea&s;on is not to direct us what Pa&s;&s;ion to exerci&s;e, but to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in RECTIFYING, and keeping within due bounds, that which Nature hath &s;o &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed; becau&s;e</P>

<P><PB N="60" REF="104">
VER. 167. <HI>Like warying winds,</HI> &amp;c.] The poet having proved that the <HI>ruling pa&s;&s;ion</HI> (&s;ince Nature hath given it us) is not to be overthrown, but <HI>rectified,</HI> the next inquiry will be of what <HI>u&s;e</HI> the ruling Pa&s;&s;ion is; for an u&s;e it mu&s;t have, if rea&s;on be to treat it thus mildly. This u&s;e he &s;hews us (from &vers; 166 to 197) is twofold, Natural and Moral.</P>
<P N="1">1. Its <HI>Natural</HI> u&s;e is to conduct Men &s;teddily to one certain end; who would otherwi&s;e be eternally fluctuating between the equal violence of various and di&s;cordant pa&s;&s;ions, driving them up and down at random; and, by that means, to enable them to promote the good of Society, by making each a contributor to the common &s;tock:</P>
<Q><L>Let pow'r or knowledge, gold or glory, plea&s;e, &amp;c.</L></Q>
<P N="2">2. Its <HI>Moral</HI> u&s;e is to ingraft our ruling Virtue upon it; and by that means to enable us to promote our own good, by turn|ing
<PB N="61" REF="105">
the exorbitancy of the <HI>ruling pa&s;&s;ion</HI> into its neighbouring Virtue:</P>
<Q><L>See anger, zeal and fortitude &s;upply; &amp;c.</L></Q>
<P>The wi&s;dom of the divine Arti&s;t is, as the poet finely ob|&s;erves, very illu&s;trious in this contrivance; for the mind and body having now one common intere&s;t, the efforts of Virtue will have their force infinitely augmented:</P>
<Q><L>'Tis thus the Mercury, &amp;c.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="62" REF="106">
VER. 197. <HI>Rea&s;on the bya&s;s</HI> &amp;c.] But le&s;t it &s;hould be objected that this account favours the doctrine of Nece&s;&s;ity, and would in&s;inuate that Men are only acted upon, in the production of Good out of Evil, the poet teacheth (from &vers; 196 to 203) that Man is a free agent, and hath it in his own power to turn the natural pa&s;&s;ions into Virtues or into Vices, properly &s;o called:

<P>Secondly, If it &s;hould be objected, that though he doth in|deed tell us &s;ome actions are beneficial and &s;ome hurtful, yet he could not call tho&s;e <HI>virtuous</HI> nor the&s;e <HI>vicious,</HI> becau&s;e, as he hath de&s;cribed things, the motive appears to be only the gratifi|cation of &s;ome pa&s;&s;ion; give me leave to an&s;wer for him, that this would be mi&s;taking the argument, which (to &vers; 249 of this epi&s;tle) con&s;iders the pa&s;&s;ions only with regard to <HI>Society,</HI> that is, with regard to their <HI>effects</HI> rather than their <HI>motives.</HI> That how|ever, 'tis his de&s;ign to teach that actions are <HI>properly virtuous and vicious;</HI> and though it be difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h genuine Virtue from &s;purious, they having both the &s;ame appearance, and both the &s;ame public effects, yet they may be di&s;embarra&s;&s;ed. If it be a&s;ked, by what means? He replies (from &vers; 202 to 205) By Con&s;cience; which is to the purpo&s;e; for it is &s;olely a Man's own concern to know whether his Virtue be pure and &s;olid; for
<PB N="64" REF="108">
what is it to <HI>others,</HI> whether this Virtue, while, as to them, the effects of it is the &s;ame, be real or un&s;ub&s;tantial?</P>
<P>VER. 205. <HI>Extremes in Nature equal ends produce,]</HI> But &s;till it will be &s;aid, why all this difficulty to di&s;tingui&s;h true Virtue from fal&s;e? The poet &s;hews why (from &vers; 204 to 211) That though indeed Vice and Virtue &s;o invade each other's bounds, that &s;ome|times we can &s;carce tell where one ends and the other begins, yet great purpo&s;es are &s;erved thereby, no le&s;s than the perfect|ing the con&s;titution of the whole, as lights and &s;hades, which run into one another in a well-wrought picture, make the har|mony and &s;pirit of the compo&s;ition. But on this account to &s;ay there is neither Vice or Virtue, the poet &s;hews (from &vers; 210 to 217) would be ju&s;t as wi&s;e as to &s;ay there is neither black nor white; becau&s;e the &s;hade of that and the light of this often run into one another:
<Q><L>A&s;k your own heart, and nothing is &s;o plain;</L>
<L>'Tis to mi&s;take them, co&s;ts the time and pain.</L></Q>
This is an error of <HI>&s;peculation,</HI> which leads Men &s;o fooli&s;hly to conclude, that there is neither Vice nor Virtue.</P>

It is this, that though, at the fir&s;t a&s;pect, Vice be &s;o horrible as to affright all behold|ers, yet, when by habit we are once grown familiar with her, we fir&s;t &s;uffer, and in time begin to lo&s;e the memory of her na|ture; which nece&s;&s;arily implies an equal ignorance in the na|ture of Virtue.

An adherence or regard to what is, in the &s;en&s;e of the world, a Man's own Intere&s;t, making an extreme in either impo&s;&s;ible.

On the contrary, had he &s;uppo&s;ed Man &s;o blind as to be bu&s;ied in chu&s;ing, or doubtful in his choice, between
<PB N="40" REF="82">
two objects <HI>equally wrong,</HI> the ca&s;e had appeared de&s;perate, and all <HI>&s;tudy of Man</HI> had been effectually di&s;couraged.

Of which, the learned Reader may take the following exam|ples. The Poet &s;ays,
<Q><L>Man acts between; in doubt to <HI>act,</HI> or <HI>re&s;t.</HI></L></Q>
Now he tells us 'tis Man's duty to <HI>act,</HI> not <HI>re&s;t,</HI> as the Stoics thought; and, to this their principle the latter word alludes, who&s;e Virtue, as he &s;ays afterwards, is

<L>Contracted all, retiring to the brea&s;t:</L>
<L>But &s;trength of mind is <HI>EXERCISE</HI> not <HI>REST.</HI></L></Q>
Now hear the Tran&s;lator, who is not for mincing matters,
<Q><L><HI>Seroit-il en nai&s;&s;ant</HI> au travail condamn&eacute;?</L>
<L><HI>Aux</HI> douceurs du r&eacute;pos <HI>&s;eroit-il de&s;tin&eacute;?</HI></L></Q>

<PB N="41" REF="83">
&s;entiments, breaks out into this ju&s;t and moral reflection on man's condition here,
<Q><L>Born but to die, and reas'ning but to err.</L></Q>
The Tran&s;lator turns this fine and &s;ober thought into the mo&s;t outragious Sceptici&s;m;

<P>VER. 31. <HI>Superior beings,</HI> &amp;c.] In the&s;e lines he &s;peaks to this effect: But to make you fully &s;en&s;ible of the dif|ficulty of this &s;tudy, I &s;hall in&s;tance in the great Newton him&s;elf; whom, when &s;uperior beings, not long &s;ince, &s;aw capable of unfolding the whole law of Nature, they were in doubt whether the owner of &s;uch prodigious &s;cience &s;hould not be reckoned of their own order; ju&s;t as men, when they &s;ee the &s;urpri&s;ing marks of Rea&s;on in an Ape, are almo&s;t tempted to rank him with their own kind. And yet this wondrous Man could go no farther in the knowledge of him&s;elf than the generality of his &s;pecies. In which we &s;ee it was not Mr. Pope's inten|tion to bring any of the Ape's <HI>qualities,</HI> but its <HI>&s;agacity,</HI> into the compari&s;on. But why the <HI>Ape's,</HI> it may be &s;aid, rather than the &s;agacity of &s;ome more decent animal, particularly the <HI>half-rea&s;oning elephant,</HI> as the poet calls it; which, as

well on account of this its &s;uperiority, as for its having no ridiculous &s;ide, like the Ape, on which it could be viewed, &s;eems better to have de&s;erved this honour? I reply, Becau&s;e, as none but a &s;hape <HI>re&s;embling human,</HI> accompa|nied with great &s;agacity, could occa&s;ion the <HI>doubt</HI> of that ani|mal's relation to Man, the Ape only having that re&s;emblance, no other animal was fitted for the compari&s;on. And on this ground of relation the whole beauty of the thought depends; Newton and tho&s;e &s;uperior &s;pirits being equally immortal, though of different orders. And here let me take notice of a new &s;pecies of the Sublime, of which our poet may be ju&s;tly &s;aid to be the maker; &s;o new, that we have yet no name for it, though of a nature di&s;tinct from every other poetical excellence. The two great perfections of works of genius are Wit and Subli|mity. Many writers have been witty, &s;everal have been &s;ublime, and &s;ome few have even po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed both the&s;e qua|lities &s;eparately; but none that I know of, be&s;ides our Poet, hath had the art to incorporate them; of which he hath given many examples, both in this E&s;&s;ay and his other poems, one of the noble&s;t being the pa&s;|&s;age in que&s;tion. This &s;eems to be the la&s;t effort of the imagination, to poetical per|fection: and in this com|pounded excellence the Wit receives a dignity from the Sublime, and the Sublime a &s;plendor from the Wit; which, in their &s;tate of &s;eparate ex|i&s;tence, they both wanted.</P>

<HEAD>COMMENTARY</HEAD>
<P>WE are now come to the third epi&s;tle of the E&s;&s;ay on Man. It having been &s;hewn, in explaining the origin, u&s;e, and end of the Pa&s;&s;ions, in the &s;econd epi&s;tle, that Man hath &s;ocial as well as &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ions, that doctrine naturally introduceth the third, which treats of Man as a SOCIAL animal; and connects it with the &s;econd, which con&s;idered him as an INDIVIDUAL. And as the conclu&s;ion from the &s;ubject of the fir&s;t epi&s;tle made the introduction to the &s;econd, &s;o here again, the conclu&s;ion of the &s;econd
<Q><L>(Ev'n mean Self-love becomes, by force divine,</L>
<L>The &s;cale to mea&s;ure others wants by thine.)</L></Q>
maketh the introduction to the third.</P>
<P>VER. 1.</P>
<P><Q><L>Here then we re&s;t: "The Univer&s;al Cau&s;e</L>
<L>"Acts to one end, but acts by various laws."]</L></Q>
The rea&s;on of <HI>variety</HI> in tho&s;e laws, which tend to <HI>one</HI> and the &s;ame <HI>end,</HI> the good of the Whole generally, is, becau&s;e the good of the individual is likewi&s;e to be provided for; both which toge|ther make up the good of the Whole univer&s;ally. And this is the cau&s;e, as the poet &s;ays el&s;ewhere, that
<Q><L>Each individual &s;eeks a &s;ev'ral goal.</L></Q>
But to prevent our re&s;ting there, God hath made each need the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of another; and &s;o
<Q><L>On mutual wants built mutual happine&s;s.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="120" MS="Y">
It was nece&s;&s;ary to explain the&s;e two fir&s;t lines, the better to &s;ee the pertinency and force of what followeth (from &vers; 2 to 7) where the poet warns &s;uch to take notice of this truth, who&s;e circum&s;tances placing them in an imaginary &s;tation of Indepen|dence, and a real one of In&s;en&s;ibility to mutual Wants (from whence general Happine&s;s re&s;ults) make them but too apt to overlook the true &s;y&s;tem of things; <HI>viz.</HI> Men in full health and opulence. This caution was nece&s;&s;ary with regard to Society; but &s;till more nece&s;&s;ary with regard to Religion: Therefore he e&s;pecially recommends the memory of it both to Clergy and Laity, when they preach or pray; becau&s;e the preacher, who doth not con&s;ider the fir&s;t Cau&s;e under this view, as a Being con&s;ulting the good of the whole, mu&s;t needs give a very un|worthy idea of him; and the &s;upplicant, who prayeth as one not related to a whole, or as di&s;regarding the happine&s;s of it, will not only pray in vain, but offend his Maker by an im|pious attempt to counter-work his di&s;pen&s;ation.</P>
<P>VER. 7. <HI>Look round our World;</HI> &amp;c.] Next he introduceth his &s;y&s;tem of human Sociability (&vers; 7, 8) by &s;hewing it to be the
<PB N="75" REF="121" MS="Y">
dictate of the Creator; and that Man, in this, did but follow the example of general Nature, which is united in one clo&s;e &s;y&s;tem of benevolence.</P>
<P>VER. 9. <HI>See pla&s;tic Nature working to this end,]</HI> This he proveth, <HI>fir&s;t</HI> (from &vers; 8 to 13) on the noble theory of Attraction, from the oeconomy of the material world; where there is a ge|neral con&s;piracy in all the particles of Matter to work for one end; the u&s;e, beauty, and harmony of the whole ma&s;s.</P>
<P>VER. 13. <HI>See Matter next,</HI> &amp;c.] The <HI>&s;econd</HI> argument (from &vers; 12 to 27) is taken from the vegetable and animal world; who&s;e Beings &s;erve mutually for the production, &s;up|port, and &s;u&s;tentation of each other.</P>
<P>But this part of the argument, in which the poet tell us, that God
<Q><L>Connects each being, greate&s;t with the lea&s;t;</L>
<L>Made Bea&s;t in aid of Man, and Man of Bea&s;t;</L>
<L>All &s;erv'd, all &s;erving&mdash;</L></Q>
<PB N="76" REF="122" MS="Y">
awaking again the old pride of his adver&s;aries, who cannot bear that Man &s;hould be thought to be <HI>&s;erving</HI> as well as <HI>&s;erved;</HI> he takes this occa&s;ion again to humble them (from &vers; 26 to 49) by the &s;ame kind of argument he had &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully employed in the fir&s;t epi&s;tle, and which our comment on that epi&s;tle hath con&s;idered at large.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="124" MS="Y">
VER. 49. <HI>Grant that the pow'rful &s;till the weak controul;]</HI> However, his adver&s;aries, loth to give up the que&s;tion, will rea&s;on upon the matter; and we are now to &s;uppo&s;e them objecting again&s;t Providence in this manner.&mdash;We grant, &s;ay they, that in the irrational, as in the inanimate creation, all is <HI>&s;erved,</HI> and all is <HI>&s;erving:</HI> But, with regard to Man, the ca&s;e is different; he &s;tandeth &s;ingle. For his Rea&s;on hath endowed him both with power and addre&s;s &s;ufficient to make all things &s;erve him; and his Self-love, of which you have &s;o largely provided for him, will di&s;po&s;e him, in his turn, to &s;erve none: Therefore your theory is imperfect.&mdash;Not &s;o, replies the poet (from &vers; 48 to 79) I grant that Man, indeed, affects to be the Wit and Ty|rant of the whole, and would fain &s;hake off
<Q><L>&mdash;that chain of love,</L>
<L>Combining all below and all above:</L></Q>
But Nature, even by the very gift of Rea&s;on, checks this tyrant. For Rea&s;on endowing Man with the ability of &s;etting together the memory of the pa&s;t with his conjectures about the future; and pa&s;t misfortunes making him apprehen&s;ive of more to come, this di&s;po&s;eth him to pity and relieve others in a &s;tate of &s;uffer|ing. And the pa&s;&s;ion growing habitual, naturally extendeth its
<PB N="79" REF="125">
effects to all that have a &s;en&s;e of &s;uffering. Now as brutes have neither Man's Rea&s;on, nor his inordinate Self-love, to draw them from the &s;y&s;tem of Benevolence; &s;o they wanted not, and therefore have not, this human &s;ympathy of another's mi&s;ery. By which pa&s;&s;ion, we &s;ee, tho&s;e qualities, in Man, balance one another; and &s;o retain him in that general Order, in which Providence hath placed its whole creation. But this is not all; Man's intere&s;t, amu&s;ement, vanity, and luxury, tie him &s;till clo&s;er to the &s;y&s;tem of benevolence, by obliging him to provide for the &s;upport of other animals; and though it be, for the mo&s;t part, only to devour them with the greater gu&s;t, yet this does not abate the proper happine&s;s of the animals &s;o pre|&s;erved, to whom Providence hath not imparted the u&s;ele&s;s knowledge of their end. From all which it appears, that the theory is yet uniform and perfect.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="126" MS="Y">
VER. 79. <HI>Whether with Rea&s;on,</HI> &amp;c.] But even to this, as a caviller would &s;till object, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e him &s;o to do, and &s;ay,&mdash;Admit you have &s;hewn that Nature hath endowed all ani|mals, whether human or brutal, with &s;uch faculties as admira|bly fit them to promote the general good: yet, in its care for this, hath not Nature neglected to provide for the private good of the individual? We have cau&s;e to think &s;he hath; and we &s;uppo&s;e, it was on this exclu&s;ive con&s;ideration that &s;he kept back from brutes the gift of Rea&s;on (&s;o nece&s;&s;ary a means of private happine&s;s) becau&s;e Rea&s;on, as we find in the in&s;tance of

<HI>Man,</HI> where there is occa&s;ion for all the complicated contrivance you have de&s;cribed above, to make the effects of his Pa&s;&s;ions counter-work the immediate powers of his Rea&s;on, in order to keep him &s;ub&s;ervient to the general &s;y&s;tem; Rea&s;on, we &s;ay, naturally tends to draw Beings into a private, independent &s;y&s;tem. This the poet an&s;wers, by &s;hewing (from &vers; 78 to 109) that the happine&s;s of animal and that of human life are widely dif|ferent: The happine&s;s of human life con&s;i&s;ting in the improve|ment of the mind, can be procured by Rea&s;on only; but the happine&s;s of animal life con&s;i&s;ting in the gratifications of &s;en&s;e, is be&s;t promoted by In&s;tinct. And, with regard to the regular and con&s;tant operation of each, in <HI>that,</HI> In&s;tinct hath plainly the advantage; for here God directs immediately; there, only mediately through Man.</P>

VER. 109. <HI>God, in the nature of each being,</HI> &amp;c.] The au|thor now cometh to the main &s;ubject of his epi&s;tle, the proof of Man's SOCIABILITY, from the two general &s;ocieties com|po&s;ed by him; the <HI>natural,</HI> &s;ubject to <HI>paternal</HI> authority; and the <HI>civil,</HI> &s;ubject to that of a <HI>magi&s;trate.</HI> This he hath the ad|dre&s;s to introduce, from what had preceded, in &s;o ea&s;y and na|tural
<PB N="83" REF="129">
a manner, as &s;heweth him to have the art of giving all the grace to the dryne&s;s and &s;everity of Method, as well as wit to the &s;trength and depth of Rea&s;on. The philo&s;ophic na|ture of his work requiring he &s;hould &s;hew by what means tho&s;e Societies were introduced, this affords him an opportunity of &s;liding gracefully and ea&s;ily from the preliminaries into the main &s;ubject; and &s;o of giving his work that perfection of method, which we find only in the compo&s;itions of great writers. For having ju&s;t before, though to a different purpo&s;e, de&s;cribed the power of be&s;tial In&s;tinct to attain the happine&s;s of the <HI>Indivi|dual,</HI> he goeth on, in &s;peaking of In&s;tinct as it is &s;erviceable both to that, and to the <HI>Kind</HI> (from &vers; 108 to 147) to illu&s;trate the original of <HI>Society.</HI> He &s;heweth, that though, as he had before ob&s;erved, God had founded the proper bli&s;s of each crea|ture in the nature of its own exi&s;tence; yet the&s;e not being independent individuals, but parts of a Whole, God, to ble&s;s that Whole, built mutual happine&s;s on mutual wants: Now, for the &s;upply of mutual wants, creatures mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily come together; which is the fir&s;t ground of Society among&s;t Men. He then proceeds to that called <HI>natural,</HI> &s;ubject to <HI>paternal</HI> autho|rity, and ari&s;ing from the union of the two &s;exes; de&s;cribes the
<PB N="84" REF="130" MS="Y">

<PB N="86" REF="132">
poet's <HI>natural</HI> Society: Therefore, after his account of that &s;tate, he proceedeth to &s;upport the reality of it by overthrowing the oppugnant principle of <HI>no natural Ju&s;tice;</HI> which he doth (from &vers; 146 to 169) in &s;hewing, by a fine de&s;cription of the &s;tate of Innocence, as repre&s;ented in Scripture, that a &s;tate of Nature was &s;o far from being without natural Ju&s;tice, that it was, at fir&s;t, <HI>the reign of God,</HI> where Right and Truth univer&s;ally prevailed.</P>

VER. 169. <HI>See him from Nature ri&s;ing &s;low to Art!]</HI> Strict method (in which, by this time, the reader finds the poet more conver&s;ant than &s;ome were aware of) leads him next to &s;peak of that Society, which &s;ucceeded the <HI>Natural,</HI> namely the <HI>Civil.</HI> He fir&s;t explains (from &vers; 169 to 199) the intermediate <HI>means</HI> which led Mankind from natural to civil Society. The&s;e were the invention and improvement of Arts. For while Mankind lived in a mere &s;tate of Nature, there was no need of any other government than the Paternal; but when Arts were found out and improved, then that more perfect form, under the direc|tion of a Magi&s;trate, became nece&s;&s;ary.

fir&s;t, to bring tho&s;e arts, already found, to perfection: And, &s;econdly, to &s;ecure the product of them to their rightful proprietors. The poet, therefore, comes now, as we &s;ay, to the invention of Arts; but being always intent on the great end for which he wrote his E&s;&s;ay, namely to mortify that Pride which occa&s;ions the impious complaints again&s;t Providence; he &s;peaks of the&s;e inventions as only le&s;&s;ons learnt of mere animals guided by in&s;tinct; and thus, at the &s;ame time, gives a new in&s;tance of the wonderful Providence of God, who has contrived to teach mankind in a way, not only proper to humble human arrogance, but to rai&s;e our idea of infinite Wi&s;dom to the greate&s;t pitch.

</LG>
<P>The delicacy of the poet's addre&s;s in the fir&s;t part of the la&s;t line, is very remarkable. In this paragraph he has given an ac|count of tho&s;e intermediate means, that led Mankind from na|tural to civil Society, namely, the invention and improvement of Arts. Now here, on his conclu&s;ion of this account, and his entry upon the de&s;cription of civil Society it&s;elf, he connects the two parts the mo&s;t gracefully that can be conceived, by this true hi&s;torical circum&s;tance, that it was the invention of tho&s;e Arts which rai&s;ed to the Magi&s;tracy in this new Society formed for the perfecting them.</P>

However, that it is true that the &s;ame wi&s;dom or valour, which gained regal obedience from &s;ons to the fire, procured kings a paternal authority, and made them con|&s;idered as fathers of their people. Which probably was the ori|ginal (and, while mi&s;taken, continues to be the chief &s;upport) of that &s;lavi&s;h error; antiquity repre&s;enting its earlie&s;t monarchs under the idea of a common father, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.

This third epi&s;tle, we &s;ee, con&s;iders Man with re&s;pect to So|ciety; the &s;econd, with re&s;pect to Him&s;elf; and the fourth, with re&s;pect to Happine&s;s. But in none of the&s;e relations does the poet ever lo&s;e &s;ight of him under that in which he &s;tands to God; it will follow, therefore, that &s;peaking of him with re&s;pect to So|ciety, the account would be then mo&s;t imperfect, were he not at the &s;ame time con&s;idered with re&s;pect to his Religion; for be|tween the&s;e two there is a clo&s;e, and, while things continue in order, a mo&s;t intere&s;ting connection:
<Q><L>True faith, true policy united ran;</L>
<L>That was but love of God, and this of Man.</L></Q>
Now Religion &s;uffering no change or depravation, when Man fir&s;t entered into civil Society, but continuing the &s;ame as in the &s;tate of Nature; the author, to avoid repetition, and to bring the accounts of <HI>true</HI> and <HI>fal&s;e</HI> religion nearer to one another, in or|der to contra&s;t them by the advantage of that &s;ituation, deferred giving account of his <HI>Religion</HI> till he had &s;poken of the origin of that Society. Thence it is that he here re&s;umes the account of the &s;tate of Nature, that is, &s;o much of it as he had left un|touched, which was only the Religion of it. This con&s;i&s;ting in

And &s;imple Rea&s;on teaching them that the Creator was but One, they ea&s;ily &s;aw that all was right, and were in as little danger of falling into the Manichean error; which, when oblique Wit had broken the &s;teddy light of Rea&s;on, imagined all was not right, having before imagined all was not the work of One. <HI>Secondly,</HI> he &s;hews what they under&s;tood of God's <HI>Attributes;</HI> that they ea&s;ily conceived a Father where they

Secondly, That the Su|per&s;tition he brought in was not invented by him, as an engine to play upon others (as the dreaming Athei&s;t feigns, who would thus mi&s;erably account for the origin of Religion) but was a trap he fir&s;t fell into him&s;elf.</P>

For Self-love being common to the whole &s;pecies, and &s;etting each individual in pur&s;uit of the &s;ame objects, it became nece&s;&s;ary for each, if he would &s;ecure his own, to provide for the &s;afety of another's.

<P>It is true, the poet ob&s;erves, that afterwards, when the Ty|rant's fright was over, he had cunning enough, from the ex|perience of the effect of Su|per&s;tition upon him&s;elf, to turn it by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Prie&s;t (who for his reward went &s;harer with him in the Tyran|ny) as his be&s;t defence again&s;t his Subjects.

<P><PB N="98" REF="144">
The ancient Pagan Gods are here very exactly de&s;cribed. This fact is a convincing evi|dence of the truth of that ori|ginal which the poet giveth to Super&s;tition; for if the&s;e phan|ta&s;ms were fir&s;t rai&s;ed in the imagination of Tyrants, they mu&s;t needs have the qualities here a&s;&s;igned to them. For Force being the Tyrant's Vir|tue, and Luxury his Happine&s;s, the attributes of his God would of cour&s;e be Revenge and Lu&s;t; in a word, the anti-type of him&s;elf. But there was ano|ther, and more &s;ub&s;tantial cau&s;e, of the re&s;emblance be|tween a Tyrant and a Pagan god; and that was the making <HI>Gods of Conquerors,</HI> as the poet &s;ays, and &s;o canonizing a ty|rant's vices with his per&s;on. That the&s;e gods &s;hould &s;uit a people humbled to the &s;troke of a ma&s;ter, will be no won|der, if we recollect a generous &s;aying of the ancients; <HI>That day which &s;ees a Man a &s;lave, takes away half his Virtue.</HI></P>

Yet hath the poet been accu&s;ed of e&s;|pou&s;ing that impious whim&s;y.

is a full &s;olution of all difficul|ties, I cannot think, for rea|&s;ons too long to be given in this place. Perhaps we &s;hall never have a full &s;olution in this world: and it may be no great matter though we have not, as we are demon&s;trably certain of the moral attributes of the Deity. However, Mr. Pope may be ju&s;tified in re|ceiving and inforcing this Pla|tonic notion, as it hath been adopted by the mo&s;t celebrat|ed and orthodox divines both of the ancient and modern church.</P>
<P>This doctrine, we own then, was taken up by Leibnitz; but it was to ingraft upon it a mo&s;t pernicious fatali&s;m. Plato &s;aid, God <HI>cho&s;e</HI> the be&s;t: Leibnitz &s;aid, he <HI>could not but</HI> chu&s;e the be&s;t. Plato &s;uppo&s;ed freedom in God to chu&s;e one of two things equally good: Leibnitz held the &s;uppo&s;ition to be ab|&s;urd; but however, admitting the ca&s;e, he maintained that God could <HI>not</HI> chu&s;e one of two things equally good. Thus it appears, the fir&s;t went on the &s;y&s;tem of <HI>Freedom;</HI> and that the latter, notwith&s;tanding the mo&s;t artful di&s;gui&s;es in his Theodic&eacute;e, was a thorough <HI>Fatali&s;t:</HI> For we cannot well &s;uppo&s;e he would give that freedom to Man which he had taken away from God. The truth of the matter &s;eems to be this; he &s;aw, on the one hand, the mon&s;trous ab&s;urdity of &s;uppo&s;ing with Spinoza, that blind Fate was the au|thor of a coherent Univer&s;e; but yet, on the other, could not conceive with Plato, that God could fore&s;ee and con|duct, according to an arche|typal idea, a World, of all po&s;|&s;ible Worlds the be&s;t, inhabited by <HI>free Agents.</HI> This difficul|ty therefore, which made the Socinians take Pre&s;cience from God, di&s;po&s;ed Leibnitz to take Free-will from Man: And thus he fa&s;hioned his fanta&s;tical hy|pothe&s;is; he &s;uppo&s;ed that when God made the body, he im|pre&s;&s;ed on his new cr$ated Ma|chine a certain &s;eries or &s;uite of <HI>motions;</HI> and that when he made the fellow &s;oul, a cor|re&s;pondent &s;eries of <HI>ideas;</HI> who&s;e operations, throughout the whole duration of the uni|on, &s;o exactly jumped, that whenever an <HI>idea</HI> was excited, a concordant <HI>motion</HI> was ev$r

But as this wrong judgment proceed|ed from ignorance of the rea|&s;on of the reproof, as explain|ed above, that explanation is alone &s;ufficient to rectify the mi&s;take.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="151">
However, not to leave him under the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion in a matter of &s;o much importance, I &s;hall ju&s;tify the &s;en&s;e here given to this pa&s;&s;age more at large: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> by con&s;idering the words them&s;elves; and then, by comparing this mi&s;|taken &s;en&s;e with the context.</P>
<P>The poet, we may ob&s;erve, is here &s;peaking, not of civil Society <HI>at large,</HI> but of a <HI>ju&s;t</HI> legitimate Policy:
<Q><L>Th'according mu&s;ic of a <HI>well-mix'd</HI> State.</L></Q>
Now mix'd States are of &s;e|veral kinds; in &s;ome of which the Democratic, in others the Ari&s;tocratic, and in others the Monarchic form prevails. Now as each of the&s;e mix'd Forms is equally legitimate, as being founded on the principles of natural Liberty, that man is guilty of the highe&s;t folly, who chu&s;eth rather to employ him|&s;elf in a &s;peculative conte&s;t for the &s;uperior excellence of one of the&s;e <HI>Forms</HI> to the re&s;t, than in promoting the good admi|ni&s;tration of that &s;ettled <HI>Form</HI> to which he is &s;ubject. And yet all our warm di&s;putes about Government have been of this kind. Again, if by <HI>Forms</HI> of Government mu&s;t needs be meant Legitimate Govern|ment, becau&s;e that is the &s;ub|ject under debate; then by <HI>Modes</HI> of Faith, which is the corre&s;pondent idea, mu&s;t needs be meant the modes or expla|nations of the True Faith, be|cau&s;e the author is here too on the &s;ubject of true Religion:
<Q><L>Relum'd her ancient light, not kindled new.</L></Q>
Be&s;ides, the very expre&s;&s;ion (than which nothing can be more preci&s;e) confineth us to under&s;tand, by <HI>Modes</HI> of Faith, tho&s;e human explanations of Chri&s;tian My&s;teries, in con|te&s;ting which, Zeal and Igno|rance have &s;o perpetually vio|lated Charity.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> If we con&s;ider the <HI>context;</HI> to &s;uppo&s;e him to mean, that <HI>all Forms</HI> of <HI>Go|vernment</HI> are indifferent, is making him directly contra|dict the preceding paragraph; where he extols the Patriot for di&s;criminating the <HI>true</HI> from the <HI>fal&s;e</HI> modes of Govern|ment. He, &s;ays the poet,</P>
<LG>
<L>Taught Pow'r's <HI>due</HI> u&s;e to People and to Kings,</L>
<L>Taught nor to <HI>&s;lack,</HI> nor <HI>&s;train</HI> its tender &s;trings;</L>
<L>The le&s;s and greater &s;et &s;o ju&s;tly <HI>true,</HI></L>
<L>That touching one mu&s;t &s;trike the other too;</L>
<L>'Till jarring int're&s;ts of them&s;elves create</L>
<L>Th'<HI>according</HI> mu&s;ic of a <HI>well-mix'd</HI> State.</L>
</LG>
<P>Here he recommendeth the <HI>true</HI> Form of Government, which is the <HI>mix'd.</HI> In ano|ther place he as &s;trongly con|demneth the <HI>fal&s;e,</HI> or the ab|&s;olute <HI>jure divino</HI> Form:
<Q><L>For Nature knew no right divine in Men.</L></Q>
But the Reader will not be di&s;|plea&s;ed to &s;ee the Poet's own apology, as I find it written in the year 1740, in his own hand, in the margin of a book, where he found the&s;e two celebrated lines mi&s;applied. <Q>&startq;The author of the&s;e lines was far from meaning that no one form of Govern|ment is, in it&s;elf, better than another (as, that mixed or limited Monarchy, for ex|ample, is not preferable to ab&s;olute) but that no form of Government, however excellent or preferable, in it&s;elf, can be &s;ufficient to make a people happy, un|le&s;s it be admini&s;tered with integrity. On the contrary, the be&s;t &s;ort of Govern|ment, when the <HI>form</HI> of it is pre&s;erved, and the <HI>ad|mini&s;tration</HI> corrupt, is mo&s;t dangerous.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>Again, to &s;uppo&s;e the Poet to mean, that <HI>all Religions</HI> are in|different, is an equally wrong as well as uncharitable &s;u&s;pi|cion. Mr. Pope, though his &s;ubject in this <HI>E&s;&s;ay on Man</HI> confineth him to Natural reli|gion (his purpo&s;e being to vin|dicate God's natural di&s;pen|&s;ations to Mankind again&s;t the Athei&s;t) yet giveth frequent intimations of a more &s;ublime di&s;pen&s;ation, and even of the nece&s;&s;ity of it; particularly in his &s;econd epi&s;tle (&vers; 149, &amp;c.) where he confe&s;&s;eth the weak|ne&s;s and in&s;ufficiency of hu|man Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>And in his fourth epi&s;tle, where, &s;peaking of the good Man, the favourite of Hea|ven, he &s;ayeth,</P>
<LG>
<PB N="107" REF="153">
<L>For him alone <HI>Hope</HI> leads from goal to goal,</L>

<L>'Till, lengthen'd on to <HI>Faith,</HI> and unconfin'd,</L>
<L>It pours the bli&s;s that fills up all the Mind.</L>
</LG>
<P>But Natural Religion never lengthened Hope on to Faith; nor did any Religion, but the Chri&s;tian, ever conceive that Faith could fill the Mind with Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, In this very epi&s;tle, and in this very place, &s;peak|ing of the great Re&s;torers of the <HI>religion of Nature,</HI> he inti|mates that they could only draw God's <HI>&s;hadow,</HI> not his <HI>image:</HI>
<Q><L>Re-lum'd her ancient light, not kindled new,</L>
<L>If not God's image, yet his &s;hadow drew:</L></Q>
as reverencing that truth, which telleth us, this di&s;co|very was re&s;erved for the <HI>glo|rious Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, who is the image of God.</HI> 2 Cor. iv. 4.</P>
<P>VER. 305. <HI>For Modes of Faith let gracele&s;s zealots fight;]</HI> The&s;e latter Ages have &s;een &s;o many &s;candalous contentions for <HI>modes of Faith,</HI> to the vio|lation of Chri&s;tian Charity, and di&s;honour of &s;acred Scrip|ture, that it is not at all &s;trange they &s;hould become the object of &s;o benevolent and wi&s;e an Author's re&s;entment.</P>
<P>But that which he here &s;eemed to have more particu|larly in his eye was the long and mi&s;chievous &s;quabble be|tween W&mdash;d and JACKSON, on a point confe&s;&s;edly above Rea&s;on, and among&s;t tho&s;e adorable my&s;teries which it is the honour of our Religion to find unfathomable. In this, by the weight of an&s;wers and replies, redoubled upon one another without mercy, they
<PB N="108" REF="154">
made &s;o profound a progre&s;s, that the <HI>One</HI> proved, nothing hindered, in Nature, but that <HI>the Son might have been the Fa|ther;</HI> and the <HI>Other,</HI> that no|thing hindered, in Grace, but that <HI>the Son may be a mere Creature.</HI> In a word, they made all things di&s;putable but their own dullne&s;s; and this they left unque&s;tioned; and it was the only thing they did leave, of which their readers could be certain. But if, in|&s;tead of throwing &s;o many Greek Fathers at one ano|ther's heads, they had but chanced to reflect on the &s;en&s;e of one Greek word, A$EIPIA, that it &s;ignifies both INFINITY and IGNORANCE, this &s;ingle <HI>equivocation</HI> might have &s;aved them ten thou&s;and&punc; which they expended in carrying on the controver&s;y. However tho&s;e <HI>Mi&s;ts that magnified the Scene,</HI> enlarged the Character of the Combatants: and no body ex|pecting <HI>common</HI> &s;en&s;e on a &s;ub|ject where we have no ideas, the defects of dulne&s;s di&s;ap|peared, and its advantages (for, advantages it has) were all provided for.</P>
<P>The wor&s;t is, &s;uch kind of Writers &s;eldom know when to have done. For writing them&s;elves up into the &s;ame delu&s;ion with their Readers, they are apt to venture out
<PB N="109" REF="155">
into the more open paths of Literature, where their repu|tation, made out of that &s;tuff, which Lucian calls <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, pre&s;ently falls from them, and their nakedne&s;s appears. And thus it fared with our two Worthies. The World, which mu&s;t have always &s;ome|thing to amu&s;e it, was now in good time grown weary of its play-things, and catched at a new object that promi&s;ed them more agreeable entertainment. Tindal, a kind of Ba&s;tard-Socrates, had brought our &s;pe|culations from <HI>Heaven</HI> to <HI>Earth:</HI> and, under the pre|tence of advancing the Anti|quity of Chri&s;tianity, laboured to undermine its original. This was a controver&s;y that required another management. Clear &s;en&s;e, &s;evere rea&s;oning, a thorough knowledge of pro|phane and &s;acred Antiquity, and an intimate acquaintance with human Nature, were the qualities to determine upon this Que&s;tion. A very unpro|mi&s;ing adventure for the&s;e metaphy&s;ical nur&s;lings, bred up under the &s;hade of chi|meras. Yet they would needs venture out. What they got by it was only to be once well laughed at, and then forgotten. But one odd circum&s;tance de|&s;erves to be remembered; tho' they wrote not, you may be &s;ure, in concert, yet each at|tacked his Adver&s;ary at the &s;ame time, fa&s;tened upon him in the &s;ame place, and mum|bled him ju&s;t in the &s;ame manner. But the ill &s;ucce&s;s of this e&s;cape &s;oon brought them to them&s;elves. The One made a fruitle&s;s effort to re|vive the old game, in a di&s;|cour&s;e on <HI>The importance of the Doctrine of the Trinity;</HI> and the Other has been ever &s;ince, till very lately, rambling in SPACE.</P>
<P>This &s;hort hi&s;tory, as in&s;ig|nificant as the &s;ubjects of it are, may not be altogether unu&s;e|ful to po&s;terity. Divines may learn by the&s;e examples to avoid the mi&s;chiefs done to Religion and Literature thro' the affectation of being wi&s;e above what is written, and knowing beyond what can be under&s;tood.</P>

<HEAD>COMMENTARY.</HEAD>
<P>THE two foregoing epi&s;tles having con&s;idered Man with regard to the <HI>Means</HI> (that is, in all his relations, whether as an Individual, or a Member of Society) this la&s;t comes to con&s;ider him with regard to the <HI>End,</HI> that is, Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>It opens with an Invocation to Happine&s;s, in the manner of the ancient poets, who, when de&s;titute of a patron God, applied to the Mu&s;e, and, if &s;he was engaged, took up with any &s;imple Virtue next at hand, to in&s;pire and pro&s;per their de&s;igns. This was the ancient Invocation, which few modern poets have had the art to imitate with any degree either of &s;pirit or decorum; but our author hath contrived to make it &s;ub&s;ervient to the me|thod and rea&s;oning of his philo&s;ophic compo&s;ition. I will en|deavour to explain &s;o uncommon a beauty.</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved that the Pagan deities had each their &s;e|veral <HI>names</HI> and <HI>places of abode,</HI> with &s;ome of which they were &s;uppo&s;ed to be more delighted than others, and con&s;equently to be then mo&s;t propitious when invoked by the favourite name and place: Hence we find, the hymns of Homer, Orpheus, and Callimachus to be chiefly employed in reckoning up the &s;everal names and places of abode by which the patron God was di&s;tingui&s;hed. Our poet hath made the&s;e two circum&s;tances
<PB N="112" REF="161">
&s;erve to introduce his &s;ubject. His purpo&s;e is to write of Hap|pine&s;s; method therefore requires that he fir&s;t define what men mean by Happine&s;s, and this he does in the ornament of a poetic Invocation; in which the &s;everal names, that <HI>happine&s;s</HI> goes by, are enumerated.</P>
<Q><L>Oh Happine&s;s! our being's end and aim,</L>
<L>Good, Plea&s;ure, Ea&s;e, Content! whate'er thy Name:</L></Q>
<P>After the Definition, that which follows next, is the Propo&s;i|tion, which is, <HI>that human Happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts not in external Ad|vantages, but in Virtue.</HI> For the &s;ubject of this epi&s;tle is the de|tecting the <HI>fal&s;e</HI> notions of Happine&s;s, and &s;ettling and explain|ing the <HI>true;</HI> and this the poet lays down in the next &s;ixteen lines. Now the enumeration of the &s;everal <HI>&s;ituations</HI> in which Happine&s;s is &s;uppo&s;ed to re&s;ide, is a &s;ummary of <HI>fal&s;e</HI> Happine&s;s, placed in Externals:</P>
<LG>
<L>Plant of cele&s;tial &s;eed! if dropt below,</L>
<L>Say, in what mortal &s;oil thou deign'&s;t to grow?</L>
<L>Fair op'ning to &s;ome Court's propitious &s;hine,</L>
<L>Or deep with Di'monds in the flaming mine,</L>
<L>Twin'd with the wreaths Parna&s;&s;ian laurels yield,</L>
<L>Or reap'd in iron harve&s;ts of the field?</L>
</LG>
<P><PB N="113" REF="162">
The &s;ix remaining lines deliver the <HI>true</HI> notion of Happine&s;s to be in Virtue. Which is &s;ummed up in the&s;e two:
<Q><L>Fix'd to no &s;pot is Happine&s;s &s;incere,</L>
<L>'Tis no where to be found, or ev'ry where.</L></Q>
The Poet having thus defined his terms, and laid down his pro|po&s;ition, proceeds to the &s;upport of his The&s;is; the various argu|ments of which make up the body of the Epi&s;tle.</P>
<P>VER. 19. <HI>A&s;k of the Learn'd</HI> &amp;c.] He begins (from &vers; 18 to 29) with detecting the fal&s;e notions of Happine&s;s. The&s;e are of two kinds, the <HI>Philo&s;ophical</HI> and <HI>Popular:</HI> The latter he had re-capitulated in the invocation, when Happine&s;s was called upon at her &s;everal &s;uppo&s;ed places of abode; the Philo&s;ophic only remained to be delivered:</P>
<LG>
<L>A&s;k of the Learn'd the way, the Learn'd are blind;</L>
<L>This bids to &s;erve, and that to &s;hun Mankind:</L>
<L><PB N="114" REF="163">
Some place the bli&s;s in action, &s;ome in ea&s;e;</L>
<L>Tho&s;e call it Plea&s;ure, and Contentment the&s;e.</L>
</LG>
<P>They differed as well in the means, as in the nature of the end. Some placed Happine&s;s in Action, &s;ome in Contemplation; the fir&s;t called it Plea&s;ure, the &s;econd Ea&s;e. Of tho&s;e who placed it in Action and called it Plea&s;ure, the moral rout they pur&s;ued either &s;unk them into <HI>&s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures,</HI> which ended in <HI>Pain,</HI> or led them in &s;earch of <HI>imaginary perfections,</HI> un&s;uitable to their nature and &s;tation (&s;ee Ep. i.) which ended in <HI>Vanity.</HI> Of tho&s;e who placed it in Ea&s;e, the contemplative &s;tation they were fixed in made &s;ome, for their quiet, find truth in <HI>every thing,</HI> others in <HI>nothing.</HI></P>
<P><Q><L>Who thus define it, &s;ay they more or le&s;s</L>
<L>Than this, that Happine&s;s is Happine&s;s?</L></Q>
The confutation of the&s;e Philo&s;ophic errors he &s;hews to be very ea&s;y, one common fallacy running through them all; namely this, that in&s;tead of telling us in what the Happine&s;s of <HI>human nature</HI> con&s;i&s;ts, which was what was a&s;ked of them, each bu&s;ies him&s;elf in explaining in what he placed <HI>his own.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="164" MS="Y">
VER. 29. <HI>Take Nature's path,</HI> &amp;c.] The Poet then proceeds (from &vers; 28 to 35) to reform their mi&s;takes; and &s;hews them that, if they will but take the road of Nature and leave that of mad Opinion, they will &s;oon find Happine&s;s to be a good of the <HI>&s;pecies,</HI> and, like Common Sen&s;e, equally di&s;tributed to all Man|kind.</P>

VER. 35. <HI>Remember, Man,</HI> &amp;c.] Having expo&s;ed the two fal&s;e &s;pecies of Happine&s;s, the <HI>Philo&s;ophical</HI> and <HI>Popular,</HI> and de|nounced the true, in order to e&s;tabli&s;h the la&s;t, he goes on to a confutation of the two former.</P>
<P>I. He fir&s;t (from &vers; 34 to 49) confutes the <HI>Philo&s;ophical,</HI> which, as we &s;aid, makes Happine&s;s a particular, not a general good: And this two ways; 1. From his grand principle, that God acts by general laws; the con&s;equence of which is, that Happine&s;s, which &s;upports the well being of every &s;y&s;tem, mu&s;t needs be univer&s;al, and not partial, as the Philo&s;ophers conceived. 2. From fact, that Man in&s;tinctively concurs with this de&s;igna|tion of Providence, to make Happine&s;s univer&s;al, by his having no delight in any thing uncommunicated or uncommunicable.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="166">
VER. 49. <HI>Order is Heav'n's fir&s;t law;]</HI> II. In the &s;econd place (from &vers; 48 to 67) $e confutes the popular error concern|ing Happine&s;s, namely, that it con&s;i&s;ts in Externals: Which he does, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> by inquiring into the rea&s;ons of the pre&s;ent providen|tial di&s;po&s;ition of external goods: A topic of con&s;utation cho&s;en with the greate&s;t accuracy and penetration: For, if it appears they were di&s;tributed in the manner we &s;ee them, for rea&s;ons different from the Happine&s;s of Individuals, it is ab&s;urd to think that they &s;hould make part of that Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>He &s;hews therefore, that di&s;parity of external po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions among Men was for the &s;ake of Society: 1. To promote the Harmony and Happine&s;s of a &s;y&s;tem; becau&s;e the want of external goods in &s;ome, and the abundance in others, increa&s;e general Har|mony in the obliger and obliged.</P>
<P>Yet here (&s;ays he) mark the impartial wi&s;dom of Heaven; this very Inequality of Externals, by contributing to general Har|mony and Order, produceth an Equality of Happine&s;s among&s;t Individuals.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="118" REF="167">
2. To prevent perpetual di&s;cord among&s;t men equal in power, which an equal di&s;tribution of external goods would nece&s;&s;arily occa&s;ion. From hence he concludes, that, as external goods were not given for the reward of Virtue, but for many differ|ent purpo&s;es, God could not, if he intended Happine&s;s for all, place it in the Enjoyment of Externals.</P>

<PB N="119" REF="168">
argument (from &vers; 66 to 73) again&s;t the popular error of Hap|pine&s;s being placed in Externals, is, that the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them is in&s;eparably attended with Fear; the want of them with Hope; which directly cro&s;&s;ing all their preten&s;ions to making happy, evidently &s;hews that God had placed Happine&s;s el&s;ewhere. And hence, in concluding this argument, he takes occa&s;ion (from &vers; 72 to 77) to upbraid the de&s;perate folly and impiety of tho&s;e, who, in &s;pite of God and Nature, will yet attempt to place Happine&s;s in Externals:</P>

<L>And buries madmen in the heaps they rai&s;e.</L>
</LG>
<P>VER. 77. <HI>Know, all the good</HI> &amp;c.] The Poet having thus con|&s;uted the two errors concerning Happine&s;s, <HI>Philo&s;ophical</HI> and <HI>Popular;</HI> and proved that true Happine&s;s was neither &s;olitary and partial, nor yet placed in externals; goes on (from &vers; 76 to 83) to &s;hew in what it doth con&s;i&s;t. He had before &s;aid in ge|neral, and repeated it, that Happine&s;s lay in common to the whole &s;pecies. He now brings us better acquainted with it, in a more explicite account of its nature; and tells us, it is all contained in <HI>Health, Peace,</HI> and <HI>Competence;</HI> but that the&s;e are
<PB N="120" REF="169" MS="Y">
to be gained only by VIRTUE, namely, by Temperance, In|nocence, and Indu&s;try.</P>
<P>VER. 83. <HI>The good or bad,</HI> &amp;c.] But hitherto the poet hath only con&s;idered <HI>Health</HI> and <HI>Peace:</HI>
<Q><L>But Health con&s;i&s;ts with Temperance alone;</L>
<L>And Peace, oh Virtue! Peace is all thy own.</L></Q>
One head yet remained to be &s;poken to, namely, <HI>Competence.</HI> In the pur&s;uit of Health and Peace there is no danger of running into exce&s;s; but the ca&s;e is different with regard to Compe|tence: here Wealth and Affluence would be too apt to be mi&s;|taken for it, in Mens pa&s;&s;ionate pur&s;uit after <HI>external</HI> goods. To obviate this mi&s;take therefore, the poet &s;hews (from &vers; 82 to 93) that, as exorbitant wealth adds nothing to the Happine&s;s ari&s;ing from a <HI>Competence;</HI> &s;o, as it is generally ill-gotten, it is
<PB N="121" REF="170">
attended with circum&s;tances that weaken another part of this triple chord, namely <HI>Peace:</HI></P>

<L>Lie in three words, Health, Peace, and Competence.</L>

<L>And Peace, oh Virtue! Peace is all thy own.</L>
</LG>
<P>VER. 93. <HI>Oh blind to truth,</HI> &amp;c.] Our author having thus largely confuted the mi&s;take of Happine&s;s's con&s;i&s;ting in exter|nals, proceeds to expo&s;e the terrible con&s;equences of &s;uch an opi|nion on the &s;entiments and practice of all &s;orts of men, making the Di&s;&s;olute impious and athei&s;tical; the Religious uncharita|ble and intolerant; and the Good re&s;tle&s;s and di&s;content. For when it is once taken for granted, that Happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in ex|ternals,
<PB N="122" REF="171" MS="Y">
it is immediately &s;een that ill men are often more hap|py than good; which &s;ets all conditions on objecting to the ways of Providence; and &s;ome even on ra&s;hly attempting to rectify its di&s;pen&s;ations, though by the violation of all Law, divine and human. Now this being the mo&s;t momentous part of the &s;ub|ject under con&s;ideration, is de&s;ervedly treated mo&s;t at large. And here it will be proper to take notice of the art of the poet in making this confutation &s;erve, at the &s;ame time, for a full &s;olution of all objections which might he made to his main pro|po&s;ition, <HI>that Happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts not in externals.</HI></P>
<P>I. He begins, fir&s;t of all with the Athei&s;tical complainers, and pur&s;ues their impiety, from &vers; 93 to 131

<P>But you &s;ay (adds the poet, to the&s;e impious complainers) that though it be fit Man &s;hould &s;uffer the mi&s;eries which he brings upon him&s;elf by the commi&s;&s;ion of moral evil, yet it &s;eems unfit that his innocent po&s;terity &s;hould bear a &s;hare of them.

VER. 131. <HI>But &s;till this world</HI> &amp;c.] II. But now, &s;o un|happy is the condition of our corrupt nature, that the&s;e are not the only complainers. RELIGIOUS Men are but too apt, if not to &s;peak out, yet &s;ometimes &s;ecretly to murmur again&s;t Provi|dence, and &s;ay, its ways are not equal; e&s;pecially the more in|ordinately devoted to a &s;ect or party are &s;candalized that the Ju&s;t (for &s;uch they e&s;teem them&s;elves) who are to judge the world, have no better portion in their own inheritance: The poet there|fore now leave$ tho&s;e more pro&s;ligate complainers, and turns (from &vers; 130 to 149) to the religious, in the&s;e words:
<Q><L>But &s;till this world (&s;o fitted for the knave) &amp;c.</L></Q>
As the more Impious wanted external goods to be the reward of Virtue for the Moral man; &s;o The&s;e want them for the Pious, in order to have a kingdom of the Ju&s;t: To this the poet holds it &s;ufficient to an&s;wer; Pray fir&s;t agree among your&s;elves, who tho&s;e Ju&s;t are.</P>

VER. 185. <HI>To whom can Riches give Repute, or Tru&s;t,]</HI> The poet now enters more at large upon the matter: And &s;till conti|nuing his di&s;cour&s;e to this third &s;ort of complainers (whom he indulgeth, as much more pardonable than the fir&s;t or &s;econd, in rectifying all their doubts and mi&s;takes) he proves, both from rea&s;on and example, how unable any of tho&s;e things are which the world mo&s;t admires, to make a good man happy. For as to the Philo&s;ophic mi&s;takes concerning Happine&s;s, there being little danger of their making a general impre&s;&s;ion, he had, after a &s;hort confutation, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them at once. But External goods are tho&s;e Syrens which &s;o bewitch the world with dreams of Happine&s;s, that it is of all things the mo&s;t difficult to awaken it out of its delu&s;ions; though, as he proves in an exact review of the mo&s;t pretending, they di&s;honour bad men, and add no lu&s;tre to the good. That it is only this third and lea&s;t criminal fort of complainers, again&s;t which the remaining part of the di&s;|cour&s;e is levelled, appeareth from the poet's &s;o frequently ad|dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf, while he inforceth his arguments in behalf of Providence, from henceforward to his friend.</P>
<P N="1">I. He beginneth therefore (from &vers; 184 to 205) with con&s;i|dering RICHES. 1. He examines, fir&s;t, what there is of real value or enjoyment in them; and &s;heweth, they can give the good man only that very Contentment and that very E&s;teem and Love which he had before: And &s;cornfully cries out to tho&s;e of a different opinion,</P>

2. Next he examines the imaginary value of Riches, as the fountain of Honour. For his adver&s;aries' objection &s;tandeth thus:&mdash;As Honour is the genuine claim of Virtue, and Shame the ju&s;t retribution of Vice; and as Honour, in their opinion, fol|lows Riches, and Shame Poverty; therefore the good man &s;hould be <HI>rich.</HI> He tells them in this they are much mi&s;taken:
<Q><L>Honour and &s;hame from no Condition ri&s;e;</L>
<L>Act well your part, there all the honour lies.</L></Q>
What power then has Fortune over the Man? None at all; for as her favours can confer neither worth nor wi&s;dom; &s;o nei|ther can her di&s;plea&s;ure cure him of any of his follies. On his Garb indeed &s;he hath &s;ome little influence; but his Heart &s;till remains the &s;ame:
<Q><L>Fortu$$ in Men has &s;ome &s;mall diff'rence made,</L>
<L>One flaunts in rags, one flutters in brocade.</L></Q>
But this <HI>difference</HI> extends no farther than to the habit; the pride of heart is the &s;ame both in the <HI>flaunter</HI> and the <HI>flutterer,</HI> as it is the poet's intention to in&s;inuate by the u&s;e of tho&s;e terms.</P>

throughout that Whole, acts in conformity to the will of his Creator; and therefore this Enlargement of his affection becomes a duty.

is important: Rochefoucault, E&s;prit, and their wordy di&s;ciple Mandeville, had ob&s;erved that Self-love was the Origin of all tho&s;e virtues Mankind mo&s;t admire; and therefore fooli&s;hly &s;uppo&s;ed it was the End likewi&s;e: And &s;o taught that the highe&s;t pretences to di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s were only the more artful di&s;gui&s;es of Self-love.

Indeed the ob&s;ervations then appeared to him &s;o jumbled and confounded in one another, as if the &s;e|veral parts of a regular poem had been rolled up in tickets, drawn at random, and then &s;et down as they aro&s;e. The au|thor appeared as much &s;truck with the ob&s;ervation as the editor, and agreed to put it in the pre&s;ent form, which has given the poem all the ju&s;tne&s;s of a true compo&s;ition. The introduction of the epi&s;tle on Riches was in the &s;ame condition, and under|went the &s;ame reform.</P>

EPISTLE I.] This Epi&s;tle is divided into three principal parts or members: The fir&s;t (from &vers; 1 to 99) treats of the difficul|ties in coming at the <HI>Knowledge</HI> and true <HI>Characters of Men.</HI>&mdash;The &s;econd (from &vers; 98 to 173) of the <HI>wrong means</HI> which
<PB N="165" REF="212">
both <HI>Philo&s;ophers</HI> and <HI>Men of the World</HI> have employed in &s;ur|mounting tho&s;e difficulties. And the third (from &vers; 174 to the end) treats of the <HI>right means,</HI> with directions for the applica|tion of them.</P>
<P>VER. 1. <HI>Yes, you de&s;pi&s;e the man</HI> &amp;c.] The Epi&s;tle is intro|duced (from &vers; 1 to 15) in ob&s;erving, that the <HI>Knowledge of Men</HI> is neither to be gained by Books nor Experience alone, but by the joint u&s;e of both; for that the <HI>Maxims</HI> of the <HI>Philo&s;opher</HI> and the <HI>Conclu&s;ions</HI> of the <HI>Man of the World</HI> can, &s;eparately, but &s;upply a vague and &s;uperficial knowledge: And often not &s;o much; as tho&s;e <HI>Maxims</HI> are &s;ounded in the ab&s;tract <HI>notions</HI> of the writer; and the&s;e <HI>conclu&s;ions</HI> are drawn from the uncertain
<PB N="166" REF="213">
<HI>conjectures</HI> of the ob&s;erver: But when the writer joins his <HI>&s;pecu|lation</HI> to the <HI>experience</HI> of the ob&s;erver, his <HI>notions</HI> are rectified into <HI>principles:</HI> and when the ob&s;erver regulates his <HI>experience</HI> on the <HI>general principles</HI> of the writer, his <HI>conjectures</HI> advance into <HI>&s;cience.</HI> Such is the rea&s;oning of this introduction; which, be&s;ides its propriety to the general &s;ubject of the Epi&s;tle, has a peculiar relation to each of its parts or members: For the <HI>cau&s;es of the difficulty</HI> in coming at the knowledge and characters of men, explained in the fir&s;t, will &s;hew the importance of what is here delivered, of the <HI>joint</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;peculation and practice to &s;urmount it; and the <HI>wrong means,</HI> which both <HI>philo&s;o|phers</HI> and <HI>men of the world</HI> have employed in overcoming tho&s;e difficulties di&s;cour&s;ed of in the &s;econd, have their &s;ource here deduced, which is &s;een to be a <HI>&s;eparate</HI> adherence of each to his own method of &s;tudying men, and a mutual contempt of the others. La&s;tly, the <HI>right means</HI> delivered in the third, will be of little u&s;e in the application, without the direction here delivered: For tho' <HI>ob&s;ervation</HI> di&s;covered a <HI>ruling pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> yet, without a <HI>philo&s;ophic</HI> knowledge of the human mind, we may ea&s;ily mi&s;take a <HI>&s;econdary</HI> and <HI>&s;ub&s;idiary</HI> pa&s;&s;ion for the <HI>principal,</HI> and &s;o be never the nearer in the Knowledge of Men. But the elegant and ea&s;y <HI>Form</HI> of the <HI>introduction</HI> equals the Pro|priety of its <HI>matter;</HI> for the epi&s;tle being addre&s;&s;ed to a noble per&s;on, di&s;tingui&s;hed for his knowledge of the World, it opens, as it were, in the mid&s;t of a familiar conver&s;e, which lets us at once into his character; where the poet, by affecting <HI>only</HI> to ridicule the u&s;ele&s;s Knowledge of Men confined to Books, and under the appearance of extolling only that acquired by the World, artfully in&s;inuates how equally defective this may be, when conducted on the &s;ame narrow principle: Which is too often the ca&s;e, as <HI>men of the world</HI> are more than ordinarily pre|judiced in favour of their own ob&s;ervations for the &s;ake of the

<P>VER. 15. <HI>There's &s;ome Peculiar &amp;c.]</HI> The poet enters on the Fir&s;t divi&s;ion of his &s;ubject, <HI>the difficulties of coming at the Know|ledge and true Characters of Men.</HI> The fir&s;t cau&s;e of this dif|ficulty which he pro&s;ecutes (from &vers; 14 to 19) is the great <HI>di|ver&s;ity of Characters,</HI> of which, to abate our wonder, and not di&s;courage our inquiry, he only de&s;ires we would <HI>grant</HI> him
<Q><L>&mdash;but as many &s;orts of Mind as Mo&s;s.</L></Q>
Hereby artfully in&s;inuating, that if Nature has varied the mo&s;t worthle&s;s vegetable into above three hundred &s;pecies, we need not wonder at the like diver&s;ity in the human mind: And if a variety in that vegetable has been thought of importance enough to employ the lei&s;ure of a &s;erious enquirer, much more will the &s;ame quality in this ma&s;ter-piece of Nature de&s;erve our &s;tudy and attention.</P>
<P>VER. 19. <HI>That each from other differs, &amp;c.]</HI> A &s;econd cau&s;e of this difficulty (from &vers; 18 to 21) is <HI>Man's incon&s;tancy,</HI> where|by not only one man differs from another, but each man from him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="215">
VER. 21. <HI>Add Nature's,</HI> &amp;c.] A third cau&s;e (from &vers; 20 to 23) is that <HI>ob&s;curity</HI> thrown over the Characters of men, through the &s;trife and conte&s;t between <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>cu&s;tom,</HI> between <HI>rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>appetite,</HI> between <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>opinion.</HI> And as mo&s;t men, either thro' <HI>education, temperature,</HI> or <HI>profe&s;&s;ion,</HI> have their Cha|racters warp'd by <HI>cu&s;tom, appetite,</HI> and <HI>opinion,</HI> the ob&s;curity ari&s;ing from thence is almo&s;t univer&s;al.</P>
<P>VER. 23. <HI>Our depths who fathoms,</HI> &amp;c.] A fourth cau&s;e (from &vers; 20 to 25) is deep <HI>di&s;&s;imulation,</HI> and re&s;tle&s;s <HI>caprice,</HI> whereby the &s;hallows of the mind are as difficult to be <HI>found,</HI> as the depths of it to be <HI>fathom'd.</HI></P>
<P>VER. 25. <HI>On human actions</HI> &amp;c.] A fifth cau&s;e (from &vers; 24 to 31) is the &s;udden change of his <HI>Principle of action,</HI> either on the point of its being laid open and detected, or thro' mere in|con&s;tancy.</P>

Second of the&s;e, and &s;eventh cau&s;e of difficulty (from &vers; 36 to 41) is the <HI>&s;hortne&s;s of human life,</HI> which will not &s;uffer the ob&s;erver to &s;elect and weigh out his knowledge, but ju&s;t to &s;natch it as it rolls rapidly by him down the current of Time.</P>
<P>VER. 41. <HI>Oft, in the Pa&s;&s;ions'</HI> &amp;c.] We come now to the eighth and la&s;t cau&s;e, which very properly concludes the ac|count, as, in a &s;ort, it &s;ums up all the difficulties in one (from &vers; 40 to 51) namely, that very often the <HI>man him&s;elf is ignorant of his own motive of action;</HI> the cau&s;e of which ignorance our author has admirably explain'd: When the mind (&s;ays he) is now quite tired out by the long conflict of oppo&s;ite motives, it withdraws its attention, and &s;uffers the <HI>will</HI> to be &s;eized upon by the fir&s;t that afterwards obtrudes it&s;elf, without taking notice what that motive is. This is finely illu&s;trated by what he &s;up|po&s;es the general cau&s;e of dreams; where the fancy, ju&s;t let loo&s;e, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it&s;elf of the <HI>la&s;t image</HI> which it meets with on the confines between &s;leep and waking, and on that erects all its vi&s;ionary operation; yet this image is, with great difficulty, re|collected; and never, but when &s;ome accident happens to inter|rupt our fir&s;t &s;lumbers: Then (which proves the truth of the hypothe&s;is) we are &s;ometimes able to trace the workings of the Fancy backwards, from image to image, in a chain, till we come to that from whence they all aro&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="218" MS="Y">
VER. 51. <HI>True, &s;ome are open,</HI> &amp;c.] But now in an&s;wer to all this, an <HI>objector,</HI> as the author &s;hews (from &vers; 50 to 61) may &s;ay, <Q>&startq;That the&s;e difficulties &s;eem to be aggravated: For many Characters are &s;o plainly marked, that no man can mi&s;take them: And not &s;o only in the more <HI>open</HI> and <HI>frank,</HI> but in the very <HI>clo&s;e&s;t</HI> and mo&s;t <HI>reclu&s;e</HI> likewi&s;e.&endq;</Q> Of each of which the objector gives an in&s;tance, whereby it appears, that the for|bidding clo&s;ene&s;s and concealed hypocri&s;y in the one, are as con|&s;picuous to all mankind, as the gracious openne&s;s and frank

plain-dealing of the other.&mdash;The Reader &s;ees this objection is more particularly level'd at the doctrine of &vers; 23.
<Q><L>Our <HI>depths</HI> who fathoms, and our <HI>&s;hallows</HI> finds?</L></Q>
for it here endeavours to prove, that both are equally explorable.</P>
<P>VER. 63. <HI>But the&s;e plain Characters</HI> &amp;c.] To this objection, therefore, our author replies (from &vers; 60 to 67) that indeed the fact may be true in the in&s;tances given, but that &s;uch <HI>plain characters</HI> are extremely rare: And for the truth of this, he not only appeals to experience, but explains the cau&s;es of it: 1. The Fir&s;t of which is, the <HI>vivacity of the Imagination;</HI> for that when the bias of the Pa&s;&s;ions is enough determined to mark out the Character, yet then, as the vigour of the Fancy generally ri&s;es in proportion to the &s;trength of the Appetites, the one no &s;ooner directs the bias, than the other rever&s;es it,
<Q><L>Tho' <HI>&s;trong</HI> the bent, yet <HI>quick</HI> the turns of mind.</L></Q>
2. A Second cau&s;e is the <HI>contraricty of Appetites,</HI> which drawing &s;everal ways, as <HI>Avarice</HI> and <HI>Luxury, Ambition</HI> and <HI>Indolence,</HI> &amp;c. they mu&s;t needs make the &s;ame Character incon&s;i&s;tent to it&s;elf, and con&s;equently inexplicable to the ob&s;erver,
<Q><L>Or puzzling <HI>Contraries</HI> confound the whole.</L></Q></P>
<P>VER. 66. <HI>Or Affectations</HI> &amp;c.] 3. A Third cau&s;e is <HI>Affectation,</HI>
<PB N="137" REF="220">
that a&s;pires to qualities, which neither <HI>nature</HI> nor <HI>education</HI> has given us, and which, con&s;equently, neither <HI>art</HI> nor <HI>u&s;e</HI> will ever render graceful or becoming. On this account it is, he well ob|&s;erves, that <HI>Affectation rever&s;es the &s;oul;</HI> other <HI>natural pa&s;&s;ions</HI> may indeed turn it from that bias which the <HI>ruling one</HI> has given it; but the <HI>affected pa&s;&s;ions</HI> di&s;tort all its faculties, and cramp all its operations; &s;o that it acts with the &s;ame con&s;traint that a tumbler walks upon his hands.</P>
<P>VER. 69. <HI>Unthought-of frailties</HI> &amp;c.] 4. A Fourth cau&s;e lies in the <HI>Inequalities in the human mind,</HI> which expo&s;e the <HI>wi&s;e</HI> to unexpected frailties, and conduct the <HI>weak</HI> to as unlooked for wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>VER. 71. <HI>See the &s;ame man,</HI> &amp;c.] Of all the&s;e Four <HI>cau&s;es</HI> he here gives examples: 1. Of the <HI>vivacity of the Imagination</HI> (from &vers; 71 to 77)&mdash;2. Of the <HI>contrariety of Appetites</HI> (from &vers; 76 to 81)&mdash;3. Of <HI>Affectation</HI> (from &vers; 80 to 87)&mdash;and 4.

<P>VER. 99. <HI>In vain the Sage,</HI> &amp;c.] The author having &s;hewn the difficulties in coming to the Knowledge and true Characters of men, enters now upon the <HI>&s;econd divi&s;ion</HI> of his Poem, which is <HI>of the wrong means that both Philo&s;ophers and Men of the world</HI>
<PB N="177" REF="224">
<HI>have employed in &s;urmounting tho&s;e difficulties.</HI> He had, in the Introduction, &s;poken of the ab&s;urd conduct of both, in de&s;pi&s;ing the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of each other: He now ju&s;tifies his cen&s;ure by an examination of their peculiar doctrines; and, to take them in their own way, con&s;iders them, as they would be con&s;idered, <HI>&s;eparately.</HI> And <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> of the <HI>Philo&s;opher,</HI> who&s;e principal mi&s;|take is in &s;uppo&s;ing <HI>that Actions be&s;t dccipher</HI> the <HI>Motive of the actor.</HI> This he confutes (from &vers; 98 to 109) by &s;hewing that <HI>different Actions</HI> proceed often from the <HI>&s;ame motive;</HI> whether of <HI>accident,</HI> as di&s;appointed views; or of <HI>temperature,</HI> as an adu&s;t complexion; which he thus illu&s;trates,
<Q><L>Behold! If Fortune or a Mi&s;tre&s;s frowns, &amp;c.</L></Q>
In judging therefore of <HI>Motives</HI> by <HI>Actions,</HI> the Philo&s;opher mu&s;t needs be frequently mi&s;led; becau&s;e the pa&s;&s;ion or appetite, which, when impelling to <HI>Action,</HI> we call the <HI>Motive,</HI> may be equally gratified in the pur&s;uit of quite different mea&s;ures.</P>

VER. 109. <HI>Not always Actions &s;hew the man:</HI> &amp;c.] The Phi|lo&s;opher's <HI>&s;econd</HI> mi&s;take is, that <HI>Actions decipher the Character of the actor.</HI> This too, the author con&s;utes (from &vers; 108 to 135) and, as in correcting the foregoing mi&s;take, he proved, <HI>that different Actions often proceed from the &s;ame Motive;</HI> &s;o here he proves, <HI>that the &s;ame Action often proceeds from different Motives;</HI> thus a <HI>kind Action,</HI> he ob&s;erves, as commonly ari&s;es from the accidents of pro&s;perity or fine weather, as from a natural di&s;po&s;ition to huma|nity; a <HI>mode&s;t Action,</HI> as well from pride, as humility; a <HI>brave Action,</HI> as ea&s;ily from habit or fa&s;hion, as magnanimity; and a <HI>prudent Action</HI> as often from vanity, as wi&s;dom. Now the <HI>Cha|racter</HI> being really determined by the <HI>Motives,</HI> and various, may contrary <HI>Motives</HI> producing the &s;ame <HI>Action,</HI> the <HI>Action</HI> can never decipher the <HI>Character of the actor.</HI> But further (con|tinues the poet) if we attend to what has been &s;aid, we &s;hall di&s;cover another circum&s;tance in the ca&s;e, that will not only make it extremely difficult, but ab&s;olutely impracticable to decipher the Character by the Action; and that is, the <HI>di&s;cor|dancy of Action</HI> in the &s;ame Character; a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of the two principles proved above, that <HI>different Actions proceed from the &s;ame Motive,</HI> and that <HI>the &s;ame Action proceeds from different Motives.</HI></P>

VER. 119. <HI>But grant that Actions</HI> &amp;c.] If you will judge of man by his <HI>Actions,</HI> you are not to &s;elect &s;uch only as you like, or can manage, you mu&s;t fairly take all you find: But, when you have got the&s;e together, they will prove &s;o very di&s;cordant that no con&s;i&s;tent Character can po&s;&s;ibly be made out of them. What is then to be done? Will you <HI>&s;uppre&s;s</HI> all tho&s;e you can|not reconcile to the few capital Actions which you chu&s;e for the foundation of your Character? But this the laws of truth will not permit. Will you then mi&s;call them? and &s;ay they were not the natural workings of the man, but the di&s;gui&s;es of the politician? But what will you get by that, but rever&s;ing the be&s;t known Character, and making the owner of it the direct oppo&s;ite of him&s;elf? And this (&s;ays our author) the rea&s;oning and philo&s;ophic hi&s;torian has been always ready to do with the <HI>Actions</HI> of great men; of which he gives two famous in&s;tances in the life of Cae&s;ar.

<P>The <HI>Third</HI> Book regarded Civil Regimen, or the Science of Politics, in which the &s;eve|ral forms of a Republic were to have been examined and explained; together with the &s;everal Modes of Religious Wor&s;hip, as far forth as they affect Society; between which the Author always &s;uppo&s;ed there was the mo&s;t intere&s;ting relation and clo&s;e&s;t connec|tion; &s;o that this part would have treated of Civil and Re|ligious Society in their full ex|tent.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fourth</HI> and la&s;t Book concerned private Ethics or practical Morality, con&s;idered in all the Circum&s;tances, Or|ders, Profe&s;&s;ions, and Stations of human Life.</P>
<P>The Scheme of all this had been maturely dige&s;ted, and communitated to the L.

<HEAD>NOTES.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Of the Characters of Wo|men.]</HI> There is nothing in Mr. Pope's works more highly fini&s;hed than this Epi&s;tle: Yet its &s;ucce&s;s was in no propor|tion to the pains he took in compo&s;ing it. Something he chanced to drop in a &s;hort Ad|verti&s;ement prefixed to it, on its fir&s;t publication, may per|haps account for the &s;mall at|tention given to it. He &s;aid, that <HI>no one character in it was drawn from the life.</HI> The Public believed him on his word, and expre&s;&s;ed little cu|rio&s;ity about a Satire in which there was nothing per&s;onal.</P>
<P>VER. 1. <HI>Nothing &s;o true</HI> &amp;c.] The reader perhaps may
<PB N="194" REF="242">
be di&s;appointed to find that this <HI>Epi&s;tle,</HI> which propo&s;es the &s;ame &s;ubject with the pre|ceding, is conducted on very different rules of method; for in&s;tead of being di&s;po&s;ed in the &s;ame logical connection, and filled with the like philo&s;ophi+cal remarks, it is wholly taken up in drawing a great variety of capital Characters: But if he would reflect, that the <HI>two Sexes</HI> make but <HI>one Species,</HI> and con&s;equently, that the Cha|racters of both mu&s;t be &s;tudied and explained on the &s;ame principles, he would &s;ee, that when the poet had done this in the preceding Epi&s;tle, his bu&s;ine&s;s here was, not to re|peat what he had already de|livered, but only to verify and illu&s;trate his doctrine, by every <HI>view</HI> of that perplexity of Na|ture, which <HI>his</HI> philo&s;ophy only can explain. If the reader therefore will but be at the pains to &s;tudy the&s;e Characters with any degree of attention, as they are here ma&s;terly drawn, one important parti|cular (for which the poet has artfully prepared him by the introduction) will very forci|bly &s;trike his ob&s;ervation; and that is, that all the great &s;trokes in the &s;everal Characters of <HI>Women</HI> are not only infinitely perplexed and di&s;cordant, like tho&s;e in <HI>Men,</HI> but ab&s;olutely incon&s;i&s;tent, and in a much higher degree <HI>contradictory.</HI> As &s;trange as this may appear, yet he will &s;ee that the poet has all the while &s;trictly fol|lowed Nature, who&s;e ways, we find by the former Epi&s;tle, are not a little my&s;terious; and a my&s;tery this might have re|mained, had not our author explained it at &vers; 207, where he &s;huts up his <HI>Characters</HI> with this philo&s;ophical reflexion:</P>
<LG>
<L>In Men, we <HI>various ruling Pa&s;&s;ions</HI> find;</L>
<L>In Women, <HI>two</HI> almo&s;t divide the kind;</L>
<L>Tho&s;e, only fix'd, they fir&s;t or la&s;t obey,</L>
<L>The love of Plea&s;ure, and the love of Sway.</L>
</LG>
<P>If this account be true, we &s;ee the perpetual nece&s;&s;ity (which is not the ca&s;e in <HI>Men)</HI> that <HI>Women</HI> lye under of <HI>di&s;gui&s;ing</HI> their <HI>ruling pa&s;&s;ion.</HI> Now the variety of arts employed to this purpo&s;e mu&s;t needs draw them into infinite contradic|tions
<PB N="195" REF="243">
in tho&s;e <HI>Actions</HI> from whence their general and ob|vious Character is denomi|nated: To verify this ob&s;erva|tion, let the reader examine all the Characters here drawn&punc; and try whether with this key he cannot di&s;cover that all their Contradictions ari&s;e from a de&s;ire to hide the <HI>ruling Pa&s;|&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>But this is not the wor&s;t. The poet afterwards (from &vers; 218 to 249) takes notice of another mi&s;chief ari&s;ing from this nece&s;&s;ity of hiding their ruling Pa&s;&s;ions; which is, that generally the end of each is defeated even there where they are mo&s;t violently pur&s;ued: For the nece&s;&s;ity of hiding them inducing an habitual di&s;|&s;ipation of mind, Rea&s;on, who&s;e office it is to regulate the <HI>ruling Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> lo&s;es all its force and direction; and the&s;e unhappy victims to their prin|ciples, tho' with their atten|tion &s;till <HI>fixed</HI> upon them, are ever pro&s;ecuting the means de&s;tructive of their end, and thus become ridiculous in youth, and mi&s;erable in old age.</P>
<P>Let me not omit to ob&s;erve the great beauty of the con|clu&s;ion: It is an Encomium on an imaginary Lady to whom the Epi&s;tle is addre&s;&s;ed, and artfully turns upon the fact which makes the &s;ubject of the Epi&s;tle, the <HI>contradiction of a Woman's Character,</HI> in which contradiction he &s;hews that all the lu&s;tre even of the be&s;t Character con&s;i&s;ts:
<Q><L>And yet, believe me, good as well as ill,</L>
<L>Woman's at be&s;t a <HI>Contradiction</HI> &s;till, &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P>VER. 5. <HI>How many pictures]</HI> The poet's purpo&s;e here is to &s;hew, that the Characters of Women are generally incon|&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves; and this he illu&s;trates by &s;o happy a <HI>Similitude,</HI> that we &s;ee the &s;olly, de&s;cribed in it, ari&s;es from that very principle which gives birth to this incon&s;i&s;tency of Character.</P>

<HEAD>COMMENTARY.</HEAD>
<P>EPISTLE III.] This Epi&s;tle was written after a violent out|cry again&s;t our Author, on a &s;uppo&s;ition that he had ridiculed a worthy nobleman merely for his wrong ta&s;te. He ju&s;tified him|&s;elf upon that article in a letter to the Earl of Burlington; at the end of which are the&s;e words: <Q>&startq;I have learnt that there are &s;ome who would rather be wicked than ridiculous; and there|fore it may be &s;afer to attack vices than follies. I will there|fore leave my betters in the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their idols, their groves, and their high places; and change my &s;ubject from their pride to their meanne&s;s, from their vanities to their mi|&s;eries; and as the only certain way to avoid mi&s;con&s;tructions, to le&s;&s;en offence, and not to multiply ill-natured applications, I may probably, in my next, make u&s;e of real names in&s;tead of fictitious ones.&endq;</Q> <BIBL>P.</BIBL></P>
<P>VER. 1. <HI>Who &s;hall decide,</HI> &amp;c.] The addre&s;s of the <HI>Introduction</HI> (from &vers; 1 to 21) is remarkable: The poet repre&s;ents him|&s;elf and the noble Lord his friend, as in a conver&s;ation, philo|&s;ophi&s;ing on the <HI>final cau&s;e</HI> of <HI>Riches;</HI> and it porceeds by way of
<PB N="216" REF="267" MS="Y">
dialogue, which mo&s;t writers u&s;e to hide want of method; our Author only to &s;often and enliven the dryne&s;s and &s;everity of it. <HI>You</HI> (&s;ays the poet)</P>
<LG>
<L>&mdash;hold the word from Jove to Momus giv'n,</L>
<L>But I, who think more highly of our kind, &amp;c.</L>
<L>Opine that Nature, &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<P>As much as to &s;ay, <Q>&startq;You, my Lord, hold the &s;ubject we are upon as fit only for <HI>Satire;</HI> I, on the contrary, e&s;teem it a ca&s;e of Philo&s;ophy and profound <HI>Ethics:</HI> But as we both agree in the main <HI>Principle,</HI> that <HI>Riches were not given for the reward of Virtue, but for very different purpo&s;es</HI> (See <HI>E&s;&s;ay on Man,</HI> Ep. iv.) let us compromi&s;e the matter, and con&s;ider the &s;ubject jointly, both under your idea and mine, <HI>i. e. Sati|rically</HI> and <HI>Philo&s;ophically.&endq;</HI></Q>&mdash;And this, in fact, we &s;hall find to be the true character of this poem, which is a <HI>Species</HI> pecu|liar to it&s;elf, and partaking equally of the nature of his <HI>Ethic Epi&s;tles</HI> and his <HI>Satires,</HI> as the be&s;t pieces of <HI>Lucian</HI> aro&s;e from a combination of the Dialogues of <HI>Plato,</HI> and the Scenes of <HI>Ari&s;to|phanes.</HI> This it will be nece&s;&s;ary to carry with us, if we would &s;ee either the <HI>Wit</HI> or the <HI>Rea&s;oning</HI> of this Epi&s;tle in their true light.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="269">
VER. 21. <HI>What Nature wants,</HI> &amp;c.] Having thus &s;ettled the terms of the <HI>Debate,</HI> before he comes to the <HI>main Que&s;tion,</HI> the <HI>U&s;e of Riches,</HI> it was nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;cu&s;s a <HI>previous</HI> one, whe|ther indeed they are, upon the whole, <HI>u&s;eful to mankind or not;</HI> (which he does from &vers; 20 to 77.) It is commonly ob&s;erved, &s;ays he (from &vers; 21 to 35) <HI>That Gold mo&s;t commodiou&s;ly &s;upplies the wants of Nature:</HI> <Q>&startq;Let us fir&s;t con&s;ider the propo&s;ition in <HI>ge|neral,</HI> both in <HI>Matter</HI> and <HI>Expre&s;&s;ion;</HI> 1. As it regards the <HI>Sup|ply;</HI> and this we &s;hall find to be very <HI>unequal:</HI> 2. As it regards the <HI>Wants;</HI> and the&s;e, we &s;hall &s;ee, are very <HI>ambiguous;</HI> under
<PB N="219" REF="270">
that term, all our fanta&s;tic and imaginary, as well as real wants being comprized. Hitherto the u&s;e is not very ap|parent.
<PB N="220" REF="271">
Let us in the &s;econd place, therefore, con&s;ider the propo&s;ition in <HI>particular,</HI> or how Gold &s;upplies the <HI>wants of Nature</HI> both in private and public life: 1. As to <HI>private;</HI> it aids us, indeed, to &s;upport life; but it, at the &s;ame time, hires the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in: 2. As to <HI>Society;</HI> it may procure Friend|&s;hips and extend Trade; but it allures Robbers, and corrupts our acquaintance. 3. As to <HI>Government;</HI> it pays the Guards nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of public liberty; but it may, with the &s;ame ea&s;e, bribe a Senate to overturn it.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>The matter, therefore, being thus problematical, the poet, in|&s;tead of formally balancing between the <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Ill,</HI> chu&s;es to leave this <HI>previous Que&s;tion undetermined</HI> (as <HI>Tacitus</HI> had done before him; where, &s;peaking of the ancient <HI>Germans,</HI> he &s;ays, <HI>Argentum et aurum propitii aut irati Dii negaverint dubito;)</HI> and
<PB N="221" REF="272">
falls at once upon what he e&s;teems the <HI>principal</HI> of the&s;e abu&s;es, <HI>public&punc;Corruption.</HI></P>
<P>For having in the la&s;t in&s;tance, of the <HI>U&s;e of Riches</HI> in Go|vernment, &s;poken of <HI>venal Senates,</HI> he goes on to lament the mi&s;chief as de&s;perate and remedile&s;s; <HI>Gold,</HI> by its power to corrupt with <HI>Secrecy,</HI> defeating all the efforts of public Spirit, whether exerted in the Courage of Heroes, or in the Wi&s;dom of Patriots.</P>
<P>'Tis true indeed (continues the poet from &vers; 34 to 49) the very weight of the Bribery has &s;ometimes detected the Cor|ruption:
<Q><L>From the crack'd bag the dropping Guinea <HI>&s;poke,</HI> &amp;c.</L></Q>
But this inconvenience was &s;oon repaired, by the invention of <HI>Paper credit:</HI> Who&s;e dreadful effects on public Liberty he de|&s;cribes in all the colouring of his poetry, heightened by the warme&s;t concern for virtue; which now makes him willing to give up, as it were, the <HI>previous que&s;tion,</HI> in a pa&s;&s;ionate wi&s;h (from &vers; 48 to 59) for the return of that incumbrance attendant on public Corruption, before the &s;o <HI>common</HI> u&s;e of money.</P>
<P>And plea&s;ed with this flattering idea, he goes on (from &vers; 58 to 77) to &s;hew the other advantages that would accrue from <HI>Riches only in kind;</HI> which are, that neither <HI>Avarice</HI> could contrive to hoard, nor <HI>Prodigality</HI> to lavi&s;h, in &s;o mad and boundle&s;s a man|ner as they do at pre&s;ent. Here he &s;hews particularly, in a fine ironical de&s;cription of the embarras on <HI>Gaming,</HI> how effectually at would eradicate that execrable practice.</P>
<P>But this whole <HI>Digre&s;&s;ion</HI> (from &vers; 34 to 77) has another very uncommon beauty; for, at the &s;ame time that it ari&s;es naturally from the <HI>la&s;t</HI> con&s;ideration in the debate of the <HI>previous Que&s;tion,</HI>
<PB N="222" REF="273" MS="Y">
it artfully denounces, in our entrance on the <HI>main Que&s;tion,</HI> the principal topics intended to be employed for the dilucidation of it, namely AVARICE, PROFUSION, and PUBLIC CORRUP|TION.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="276">
VER. 77. <HI>Since then, my Lord, on &s;uch a World</HI> &amp;c.] Having thus ironically de&s;cribed the incumbrance which the want of money would occa&s;ion to all criminal exce&s;&s;es in the u&s;e of Riches, particularly to <HI>Gaming,</HI> which being now become of public concern, he affects much regard to:
<Q><L>Oh filthy check on all indu&s;trious &s;kill,</L>
<L>To &s;poil the Nation's la&s;t great trade, Quadrille!</L></Q>
<PB N="226" REF="279">
he concludes the <HI>previous Que&s;tion</HI> without deciding it, in the &s;ame <HI>ironical</HI> manner,
<Q><L>Since then, my Lord, on &s;uch a World we fall:</L>
<L>What &s;ay you? Say? Why take it, Gold and all.</L></Q>
That is, &s;ince for the&s;e great purpo&s;es we mu&s;t have <HI>Money,</HI> let us now <HI>&s;eriou&s;ly</HI> inquire into its <HI>true U&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>VER. 79. <HI>What Riches give us</HI> &amp;c.] He examines therefore in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place (from &vers; 78 to 97) I. <HI>Of what U&s;e Riches are to our&s;elves:</HI>
<Q><L>What Riches give us let us then enquire:</L>
<L>Meat, Fire, and Cloaths. What more? Meat, Cloaths, and Fire.</L></Q>
The mere <HI>turn</HI> of the expre&s;&s;ion here &s;hews, without further rea&s;oning, that all the infinite ways of &s;pending <HI>on our&s;elves,</HI> contrived in the in&s;olence of Wealth, by tho&s;e who would <HI>more than live,</HI> are only the&s;e <HI>three</HI> things diver&s;ified throughout every wearied mode of Luxury and Wantonne&s;s.</P>
<P>Yet as little as this is, adds the poet (from &vers; 81 to 85) it is only to be had by the <HI>moderate u&s;e</HI> of Riches; <HI>Avarice</HI> and <HI>Pro|fu&s;ion</HI> not allowing the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the mo&s;t exorbitant wealth even this little:</P>
<LG>
<L>Alas! 'tis more than <HI>Turner</HI> finds they give.</L>
<L>Alas! 'tis more than (all his vi&s;ions pa&s;t)</L>
<L>Unhappy <HI>Wharton,</HI> waking, found at la&s;t!</L>
</LG>
<P>But what is it you would expect them to give? continues the poet (from &vers; 84 to 91) Would you have them capable of <HI>re|&s;toring</HI> tho&s;e <HI>real</HI> ble&s;&s;ings, which men have <HI>lo&s;t</HI> by their <HI>Vices</HI> or their <HI>Villainies;</HI> or of <HI>&s;atisfying</HI> tho&s;e <HI>imaginary</HI> ones, which they have <HI>gotten</HI> by their <HI>irregular Appetites</HI> and <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions? The&s;e,</HI> &s;ure, the bad or fooli&s;h man cannot have the face to demand; and <HI>tho&s;e,</HI> by the wi&s;e provi&s;ion of Nature, Riches are incapable of giving, if he had.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="280">
But now admit, pur&s;ues our author (from &vers; 90 to 97) that wealth might, in &s;ome ca&s;es, alleviate the unmerited mi&s;eries of life, by procuring medicine both for the mind and body; yet it

<HEAD>COMMENTARY.</HEAD>
<P>EPISTLE IV.] The extremes of <HI>Avarice</HI> and <HI>Profu&s;ion</HI> being treated of in the foregoing Epi&s;tle; this takes up one particular branch of the latter, the <HI>Vanity of Expence</HI> in people of wealth and quality; and is therefore a corollary to the preceding, ju&s;t as the Epi&s;tle on the <HI>Characters of Women</HI> is to that <HI>of the Knowledge and Characters of Men.</HI> It is equally remarkable for exactne&s;s of method with the re&s;t. But the nature of the &s;ub|ject, which is le&s;s philo&s;ophical, makes it capable of being ana|li&s;ed in a much narrower compa&s;s.</P>
<P>VER. 1. <HI>'Tis &s;trange,</HI> &amp;c.] The poet's introduction (from &vers; 1 to 39) con&s;i&s;ts of a very curious <HI>remark,</HI> ari&s;ing from his intimate knowledge of nature; together with an <HI>illu&s;tration</HI> of it, taken from his ob&s;ervations on life. It is this, That the Prodigal no more <HI>enjoys</HI> his Profu&s;ion, than the Mi&s;er, his Ra|pacity. It was generally thought that <HI>Avarice</HI> only <HI>kept</HI> with|out enjoyment; but the poet here fir&s;t acquaints us with a cir|cum&s;tance in human life much more to be lamented, viz. that <HI>Profu&s;ion</HI> too can <HI>communicate</HI> without it; whereas <HI>Enjoyment</HI> was thought to be as peculiarly the reward of the <HI>beneficent</HI> pa&s;|&s;ions (of which this has the appearance) as <HI>want</HI> of enjoyment was the puni&s;hment of the <HI>&s;elfi&s;h.</HI> The phaenomenon ob&s;erved is odd enough. But if we look more narrowly into this matter, we &s;hall find, that Prodigality, when in pur&s;uit of <HI>Ta&s;te,</HI> is only a <HI>Mode of Vanity,</HI> and con&s;equently as &s;elfi&s;h a pa&s;&s;ion as even avarice it&s;elf; and it is of the ordonance and con&s;titution of all &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ions, when growing to exce&s;s, to defeat their own end, which is <HI>Self-enjoyment.</HI> But be&s;ides the accurate
<PB N="263" REF="317" MS="Y">
philo&s;ophy of this ob&s;ervation, there is a fine <HI>Morality</HI> contained in it; namely, that <HI>ill-got</HI> Wealth is not only as <HI>unrea&s;onably,</HI> but as <HI>uncomfortably</HI> &s;quandered as it was raked together; which the poet him&s;elf further in&s;inuates in &vers; 15.</P>
<Q><L>What brought Sir Vi&s;to's <HI>ill-got wealth</HI> to wa&s;te?</L></Q>
<P>&mdash;He then illu&s;trates the above ob&s;ervation by divers examples in every branch of <HI>wrong Ta&s;te;</HI> and to &s;et their ab&s;urdities in the &s;tronge&s;t light, he, in conclu&s;ion, contra&s;ts them with &s;e|veral in&s;tances of the <HI>true,</HI> in the Nobleman to whom the Epi|&s;tle is addre&s;&s;ed. This di&s;po&s;ition is productive of various beau|ties; for, by this means, the <HI>Introduction</HI> becomes an <HI>epitome</HI> of the body of the Epi&s;tle; which, as we &s;hall &s;ee, con&s;i&s;ts of ge|neral reflections on <HI>Ta&s;te,</HI> and particular examples of <HI>bad</HI> and <HI>good.</HI> And his friend's Example concluding the Introduction, leads the poet gracefully into the &s;ubject it&s;elf; for the Lord, here celebrated for his good Ta&s;te, was now at hand to deliver the fir&s;t and fundamental precept of it him&s;elf, which gives au|thority and dignity to all that follow.</P>
<P><PB N="720" REF="324">
VER. 39. <HI>O&s;t have you hinted to your brother Peer, A certain truth,&mdash;]</HI> and in this artful manner begins the body of the Epi&s;tle.</P>
<P>I.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t part of it (from &vers; 38 to 99) delivers rules for at|taining to the MAGNIFICENT in ju&s;t expence; which is the &s;ame in Building and Planting, that the SUBLIME is in Paint|ing and Poetry; and, con&s;equently, the qualities nece&s;&s;ary for the attainment of both mu&s;t have the &s;ame relation.</P>
<P N="1">1. The fir&s;t and <HI>fundamental,</HI> he &s;hews (from &vers; 38 to 47) to be SENSE:
<Q><L><HI>Good Sen&s;e,</HI> which only is the gift of Heav'n,</L>
<L>And, tho' no Science, fairly worth the &s;even.</L></Q>
And for <HI>that</HI> rea&s;on; not only as it is the foundation and parent of them all, and the con&s;tant regulator and director of their ope|rations, or, as the poet $etter expre&s;&s;es it,&mdash;<HI>of every art of the &s;oul;</HI> but likewi&s;e as it alone can, in ca&s;e of need, very often &s;upply the offices of every one of them.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="325">
VER. 47. <HI>To build, to plant,</HI> &amp;c.] 2. The next quality, for dignity and u&s;e, is TASTE, and but the next: For, as the poet truly ob&s;erves, there is&mdash;<HI>&s;omething previous ev'n to Ta&s;te&mdash;'tis Sen&s;e;</HI> and this, in the order of things: For <HI>Sen&s;e</HI> is a ta&s;te and true concep|tion of <HI>Nature;</HI> and <HI>Ta&s;te</HI> is a &s;en&s;e or true concep|tion of <HI>beautiful Nature;</HI> but we mu&s;t fir&s;t know the <HI>E&s;&s;ences</HI> of things, before we can judge truly of their <HI>Qualities.</HI> The bu|&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Ta&s;te,</HI> therefore, in the pur&s;uit of <HI>Magnificence,</HI> is, as the poet &s;hews us (from &vers; 46 to 65) 1. (to &vers; 51) To catch or lay hold on <HI>Nature,</HI> where &s;he appears mo&s;t in her charms. 2. (to &vers; 57) To adorn her, when taken, as be&s;t &s;uits her dig|nity and quality; that is, to dre&s;s her in the light and mode&s;t habit of a virgin, not load her with the gaudy ornaments of a pro&s;titute. This rule ob&s;erved, will prevent a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion in the following, which is, not to let all its beauties be &s;een at once, but in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; for that advantage is in&s;eparable from a grace|ful and well-dre&s;&s;ed per&s;on. 3. (to &vers; 65) To take care that
<PB N="272" REF="326">
the ornaments be well &s;uited to <HI>that part,</HI> which it is your pur|po&s;e to adorn; and, as in dre&s;&s;ing out a <HI>mode&s;t Fair</HI> (which is the poet's own compari&s;on) the colours are proportioned to her complexion; the &s;tuff, to the enbonpoint of her per&s;on; and the fa&s;hion, to her air and &s;hape; &s;o in ornamenting a villa, <HI>the ri&s;e or fall of waters</HI> &s;hould corre&s;pond to its acclivities or decli|vities; the <HI>artificial hills or vales</HI> to its cover or expo&s;ure; and the manner of <HI>calling in the country,</HI> to the di&s;po&s;ition of its a|&s;pect. But again, as in the illu&s;tration, whatever be the variety in colour, &s;tuff, or fa&s;hion, they mu&s;t &s;till be &s;o &s;uited with re|&s;pect to one another, as to produce an agreement and harmony in their a&s;&s;emblage; &s;o woods, waters, mountains, vales, and vi&s;tas mu&s;t, amid&s;t all their diver&s;ity, be &s;o di&s;po&s;ed with a re|lation to each other, as to create a perfect &s;ymmetry re&s;ulting from the whole; and this, the <HI>Genius</HI> of the place, when reli|giou&s;ly
<PB N="273" REF="327">
con&s;ulted, will never fail to inform us of; who, as the poet &s;ays,
<Q><L>Now breaks, and now directs th' intending lines,</L>
<L>Paints as you plant, and, as you work, de&s;igns.</L></Q>
And this is a full and complete de&s;cription of the <HI>office of Ta&s;te.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="328" MS="Y">
VER. 65. <HI>Still follow Sen&s;e,</HI> &amp;c] But now when <HI>Good Sen&s;e</HI> has led us up to <HI>Ta&s;te,</HI> our fondne&s;s for the elegancies of our new mi&s;tre&s;s, oftentimes occa&s;ions us to neglect the plainne&s;s and &s;implicity of the old; we are but too apt to for&s;ake our Guide, and to give our&s;elves up &s;olely to <HI>Ta&s;te.</HI> Our author's next rule therefore 3. is, <HI>Still to follow Sen&s;e,</HI> and let it perpetually accompany us thro' all the works of <HI>Ta&s;te.</HI>
<Q><L>Still follow Sen&s;e, of ev'ry art the <HI>Soul.</HI></L></Q>
That is, <HI>Good Sen&s;e</HI> &s;hould never be a moment ab&s;ent from the works of <HI>Ta&s;te,</HI> any more than the Soul from the Body; for ju&s;t as the Soul animates and informs every air and feature of a beau|teous body, &s;o <HI>Sen&s;e</HI> gives life and vigour to all the products of <HI>Ta&s;te.</HI></P>
<P>VER. 66. <HI>Parts an&s;w'ring parts,</HI> &amp;c.] The particular advan|tages of the union of Sen&s;e with Ta&s;te he then explains (from this ver&s;e to 71) 1. That the beautiful parts which <HI>Ta&s;te</HI> has laid
<PB N="275" REF="329">
out and contrived, <HI>Sen&s;e</HI> makes to an&s;wer one another, and to <HI>&s;lide</HI> naturally, without violence, <HI>into a whole.</HI> 2. That many beauties will <HI>&s;pontaneou&s;ly</HI> offer them&s;elves, &s;ugge&s;ted from the very nece&s;&s;ity which <HI>Sen&s;e</HI> lays upon us, of conforming the parts to the whole, that no original invention of <HI>Ta&s;te</HI> would have &s;upplied. 3. A third advantage is, that you are then always &s;ure to have <HI>Nature on your &s;ide,</HI>
<Q><L>Nature &s;hall join you&mdash;</L></Q>
The expre&s;&s;ion is important, when we were bid to <HI>begin with Sen&s;e</HI> we were &s;hewn how this would lead us to <HI>Ta&s;te,</HI> in the pur&s;uit of <HI>Nature:</HI> but now that he bids us to go on with Sen&s;e, or <HI>&s;till to follow it,</HI> after having arrived at <HI>Ta&s;te,</HI> he tells us, that <HI>Nature</HI> will then <HI>join</HI> us of her own accord: This has a great beauty, which ari&s;es from the Philo&s;ophic Truth of the ob|&s;ervation. For, as we ob&s;erved before,&mdash;<HI>Sen&s;e</HI> being a right conception of <HI>Nature;</HI> and <HI>Ta&s;te</HI> a right conception of <HI>beautiful Nature;</HI> when the&s;e are in conjunction, Nature can &s;tand out
<PB N="276" REF="330" MS="Y">

<PB N="267" REF="321">
When the Saxon kings became chri&s;tian, their piety, (which was the piety of the times) con|&s;i&s;ted in building Churches at home, and performing pilgri|mages to the Holy I and: and the&s;e &s;piritual exerci&s;es a&s;&s;i&s;ted and &s;upported one another. For the mo&s;t venerable as well as mo&s;t elegant models of re|ligious edifices were then in Pale&s;tine. From the&s;e our Saxon Builders took the whole of their ideas, as may be &s;een by comparing the drawings which travellers have given us of the churches yet &s;tanding in that country, with the Saxon remains of what we find at home; and particularly in that &s;amene&s;s of &s;tyle in the <HI>later</HI> religious edifices of the Knights Templars (profe&s;&s;edly built up|on the model of the church of the holy Sepulchre at Jeru&s;alem) with the <HI>earlier</HI> remains of our Saxon Edifices. Now the ar|chitecture of the Holy Land was entirely Grecian, but greatly fallen from its ancient elegance. Our Saxon performance was in|deed a bad copy of it, and as much inferior to the works of
St. Helene, as her's were to the Grecian models &s;he had follow|ed: Yet &s;till the foot&s;teps of an|cient art appeared in the circu|lar arches, the entire columns, the divi&s;ion of the entablature, into a &s;ort of Architrave, Frize and Cornich, and a &s;olidity e|qually diffu&s;ed over the whole ma&s;s. This, by way of di&s;tinc|tion, I would call the SAXON Architecture.</P>
<P>But our Norman works had a very different original. When the <HI>Goths</HI> had conquered Spain, and the genial warmth of the climate, and the religion of the old Inhabitants, had ripened their wits, and inflamed their mi&s;taken piety (both kept in exerci&s;e by the neighbourhood of the Saracens, thro' emula|tion of their &s;cience and aver|&s;ion to their &s;uper&s;tition,) they &s;truck out a new &s;pecies of Architecture unknown to Greece and Rome; upon ori|ginal principles, and ideas much nobler than what had given birth even to cla&s;&s;ical magni|ficence. For having been ac|cu&s;tomed, during the gloom of pagani&s;m, to wor&s;hip the Deity in GROVES (a practice common to all nations) When their new Religion required co|vered edifices, they ingeniou&s;ly projected to make them re&s;em|ble <HI>Groves,</HI> as nearly as the
<PB N="268" REF="322" MS="Y">
di&s;tance of Architecture would permit; at once indulging their old prejudices, and providing for their pre&s;ent conveniencies, by a cool receptable in a &s;ultry climate. And with what art and &s;ucce&s;s they executed the project appears from hence, That no attentive ob&s;erver ever viewed a regular Avenue of well grown trees intermixing their branches over head, but it pre&s;ently put him in mind of the long Vi&s;to thro' a Gothic Cathedral; or ever entered one of the larger and more elegant Edifices of this kind, but it repre&s;ented to his imagination $n Avenue of trees. And this alone is that which can be truly called the GOTHIC &s;tyle of Building.</P>
<P>Under this idea of &s;o extra|ordinary a &s;pecies of Architec|ture, all the irregular tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions again&s;t art, all the mon&s;trous offences again&s;t na|ture, di&s;appear; every thing has its rea&s;on, every thing is in order, and an harmonious Whole ari&s;es from the &s;tudious application of means proper and proportioned to the end. For could the <HI>Arches</HI> be otherwi&s;e than <HI>pointed</HI> when the Work|man was to imitate that curve which branches make by their inter&s;ection with one another? Or could the <HI>Columns</HI> be other|wi&s;e than &s;pilt into di&s;tinct &s;hafts, when they were to re|pre&s;ent the Stems of a group of Trees? On the &s;ame principle was formed the &s;preading rami|fication of the &s;tone-work in the windows, and the &s;tained gla&s;s in the inter&s;tices; the one being to repre&s;ent the branches, and the other the leaves of an opening Grove; and both con|curring to pre&s;erve that gloomy light in&s;piring religious horror. La&s;tly, we &s;ee the rea&s;on of their &s;tudied aver&s;ion to <HI>appa|rent</HI> &s;olidity in the&s;e &s;tupen|dous ma&s;&s;es, deemed &s;o ab|&s;urd by men accu&s;tomed to the <HI>apparent</HI> as well as <HI>real</HI> &s;trength of Grecian Architec|ture. Had it been only a wan|ton exerci&s;e of the Arti&s;t's &s;kill, to &s;hew he could give real &s;trength without the ap|pearance of any, we might in|deed admire his &s;uperior &s;cience, but we mu&s;t needs condemn his ill judgment. But when one con&s;iders, that this &s;urprizing lightne&s;s was nece&s;&s;ary to com|plete the execution of his idea of a rural place of wor&s;hip, one cannot &s;ufficiently admire the ingenuity of the contrivance.</P>
<P>This too will account for
<PB N="269" REF="323">
the contrary qualities in what I call the <HI>Saxon Architecture.</HI> The&s;e arti&s;ts copied, as has been &s;aid, from the churches in the holy Land, which were built on the models of Grecian architecture; but corrupted by prevailing barbari&s;m; and &s;till further depraved by a religious idea. The fir&s;t places of Chri|&s;tian wor&s;hip were Sepulchres and &s;ubterraneous caverns, places, of nece&s;&s;ity, low and heavy. When Chri&s;tianity be|came the Religion of the State, and &s;umptuous Temples began to be erected, they yet, in regard to the fir&s;t pious ages, pre&s;erved the ma&s;&s;ive Style: which was made &s;till more venerable by the <HI>Church of the holy Sepulchre:</HI> This, on a double account being more than ordinary heavy, was for its &s;uperior &s;anctity generally imitated.</P>
<P>Such then was GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE. And it would be no di&s;credit to the warme&s;t admirers of <HI>Jones</HI> and <HI>Palladio</HI> to acknowledge it has its merit. They mu&s;t at lea&s;t confe&s;s it had a nobler birth, tho' an humbler fortune, than the GREEK and ROMAN AR|CHITECTURE.</P>

This was not only &s;aid to deride the indecency and aukward po&s;ition of the figures, but to in&s;inuate the want of dignity in the &s;ubjects. Raphael's pagans, as the devils in Milton, act a nobler part than the Gods and <HI>Saints</HI> of ordinary poets and painters. The cartons at Hampton-Court are talked of by every body; they have been copied, engraved, and criti|ci&s;ed; and yet &s;o little &s;tudied or con&s;idered, that in the noble&s;t of them, of which more, too, has been &s;aid than of all the re&s;t, we are as much &s;trangers to St. Paul's audience in the Arcopagus, as to tho&s;e he preached before at The&s;&s;alo|nica or Beroea.</P>
<P>The &s;tory from whence the painter took his &s;ubject is this, <Q>&startq;St. Paul came to Athens, was encountered by the Epi|cureans and Stoics, taken up by them to the court of Areo|pagus, before which he made his apology; and among&s;t his converts at this time, were Diony&s;ius, the Areopagite, and a woman named Dama|ris.&endq;</Q> On this &s;imple plan he exerci&s;es his invention. Paul is placed on an eminence in the act of &s;peaking, the audience round him in a circle; and a &s;tatue of Mars in the front of his temple denotes the &s;cene of Action.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t figure has been taken notice of for the force of it's expre&s;&s;ion. We &s;ee all the marks of conviction, and re|&s;ignation to the will of the di|vine Me&s;&s;enger. But I do not know, that it has been &s;u&s;pect|ed, that a particular character was here repre&s;ented. And yet the Platonic countenance, and the female attendant, &s;hew plainly, that the painter de&s;ign|ed DIONYSIUS, whom Eccle|&s;ia&s;tical &s;tory makes of this &s;ect, and to whom &s;acred hi&s;tory has given this companion. For the woman is DAMARIS mention|ed, with him, in the <HI>Acts,</HI> as a joint convert. Either the Ar|ti&s;t mi&s;took his text, and &s;up|po&s;ed her converted with him at this audience; or, what is more likely, he purpo&s;ely com|mitted the indecorum of bring|ing a woman into the Areopa|gus, the better to mark out his <HI>Diony&s;ius;</HI> a character of great fame in the Romi&s;h Church, from a voluminous my&s;tic im|po&s;tor who has a&s;&s;umed his ti|tles. Next to this PLATONIST of open vi&s;age and extended

Conformable to his &s;tate, are his arms bu|ried in his garment, and his chin repo&s;ing on his bo&s;om; in a word, all his lineaments denote the STOIC; the &s;ymbol of which &s;ect was, <HI>Ne te quae&s;iveris extra.</HI> Adjoining to him is an old man with a &s;qualid beard and habit, leaning on his crouch, and turning his eyes upwards on the Apo&s;tle; but with a countenance &s;o &s;our and <HI>canine,</HI> that one cannot he&s;i|tate a moment in pronouncing him a CYNIC. The next that follows, by his elegance of dre&s;s, and placid air of raillery and neglect, betrays the EPI|CUREAN: As the other which &s;tands clo&s;e by him, with his &s;inger on his lips denoting <HI>&s;i|lence,</HI> plainly marks out a fol|lower of PYTHAGORAS. Af|ter the&s;e come a groupe of figures caveling in all the rage of di&s;putation, and critici&s;ing the divine Speaker. The&s;e plainly de&s;ign the ACADE|MICS, the genius of who&s;e &s;chool was to debate <HI>de quoli|bet ente,</HI> and never come to a determination. Without the Circle, and behind the princi|pal figures, are a number of young faces to denote the &s;cho|lars and di&s;ciples of the &s;eve|ral &s;ects. The&s;e are all before the apo&s;tle. Behind him are two other Figures: One re|garding the Apo&s;tle's action, with his face turned upwards; in which the pa&s;&s;ions of mali|cious zeal and di&s;appointed rage are &s;o &s;trongly marked that we needed not the <HI>red bonnet</HI> to &s;ee he was a Jewi&s;h Rabbi. The other is a pagan prie&s;t full of anxiety for the danger of the e&s;tabli&s;hed Re|ligion.</P>
<P>Thus has this great Ma&s;ter, in order to heighten the dignity of his &s;ubject, brought in the heads of every &s;ect of philo&s;o|phy and religion which were mo&s;t aver&s;e to the principles, and mo&s;t oppo&s;ed to the &s;uc|ce&s;s of the Go&s;pel; &s;o that one may truly e&s;teem this carton as the greate&s;t effort of his di|vine genius.</P>

<PB N="301" REF="357">
<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT before the 12^m^o. Edition of the E&s;say on Man, printed at London in 1751.</HEAD>
<P>The E&s;say on Man, to use the Author's own Words, is a perfect&punc; System of Ethics; in which Definition he included&punc; Religion: For he was $ar from that opinion of the noble Writer of the Characteristics, that Morality could long support itself, or have even a real existence, without a reference to the Deity. Hence it is that the first Epistle regards Man with respect to the Lord and Governor of the $auverse; as the second with respect to himself; the third to Society; and the fourth, to Happine&s;s. Having therefore form'd and finished his E&s;say in this view, he was much mortified whenever&punc; he found it considered in any other; or as a part and introduction only to a larger work. As appears from the conclu&s;ion of his &s;econd Dialogue, intitled <HI>MDCCXXXVIII,</HI> where he makes his impertinent advisor say Alas! alas! pray $nd what you began, And write, n$rt $word$, more E&s;says on Man.
<PB N="302" REF="358">
which a MS. note of his thus explains: <Q>&startq;The Author un|doubtedly meant this as $word$ &s;arcasm on the ignorance of these friends of his, who were daily pestering him for more E&s;says on Man, as not seeing that the&punc; four Epistles he had publi&s;hed entirely compleated that Subject.&endq;</Q> But it must be owned that the Public, by the great and continued demand for his E&s;say, suffi|ciently $reed itself from this imputation of wrong Judg|ment. And how great and continued that demand has been, appears from the vast variety of pirated and imperfect Editions continually obtruded on the World, ever since the first Publication of the Poem; and which no repeated pro&s;ecutions of the Offenders have been able totally to restrain.</P>
<P>These were the considerations which have now induced the Proprietor to give one perfect Edition of the E&s;say on Man, from Mr. Pope's last corrections and improvements; that the Public may from henceforth be supplied with this Poem alone, in a manner suitable to its dignity, and to the honest intention of its great Author.</P>
<P>Concerning the Universal&punc; Prayer, which concludes the E&s;say, it may be proper to observe that, some pa&s;sages in the E&s;say having been unjustly &s;us|pected of a tendency towards Fale and Naturalism,
<PB N="303" REF="359">
the Author compo&s;ed that Prayer as the Sum of all, to $$em that his System was founded in Free-will; and ter|minated in Piety: That the first Cause was as well the Lord and Governor as the Creator of the Univer&s;e&punc; and that by Submi&s;sion to his Will (the great Principle infor|ced throughout the E&s;say) was not meant the Suffering our&s;elves to be carried along with a blind determination; but a religious acquie&s;cence, and confidence full of Hope and Immortality. To give all this the greater Weight and reality, the Poet choose for his Model the Lords Prayer, which of all others best de&s;erves the Title $word$ to his Paraphra&s;e.</P>
<P>The Reader will excu&s;e my adding a Word concerning the Frontispiece; which as it was de&s;igne$ and drawn by. W. Pope himself, would be a kind of Curi|o&s;ity, had not the excellence of the thought otherwise recom|mended it. We see it reper&s;ents the Vanily of human Glory, in the false pursuits after Happine&s;s: Where the Ridicule in the Curtain-cobruch, the Death's head crown'd with Laurel, and the several In$eriptions, have all the force and beauty of one of his best wrote Sa$$res: Nor is there le&s;s expre&s;sion in the bearded Philosopher &s;itting by a foun|tain running to waste, and bloming up Bubbles with a straw from a &s;mall portion of Water taken out of it, in a dirty dish&punc; admirably representing the vain Bu&s;ine&s;s of School Philosophy, that with a little artificial Logic sits inventing $word$ arguments in support of false Science, while the human under&s;tanding at large is suffered to lie waste and uncultivated.</P>
