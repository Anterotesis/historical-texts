<HEAD>ASIA.</HEAD>
<P>ASIA is allowed to be, in all re&s;pects, by far the mo&s;t con&s;iderable part of the world; and though our innate fondne&s;s for our own country makes us give the preference to Eu|rope, yet A&s;ia has many &s;ingular advantages, which may ju&s;tly intitle it to the fir&s;t rank. It was in A&s;ia, according to the &s;acred records, that the au|thor of nature planted the delicious garden of Eden, in which he placed the fir&s;t man and woman, from whom the re&s;t of mankind were to &s;pring. A&s;ia became again the nur&s;ery of the world after the flood, whence the de&s;cendants of Noah di&s;|per&s;ed their various colonies into all the other parts of the globe. It was in A&s;ia that God made choice of the land of Canaan to place his favourite nation the Hebrews in: it was here that the great and merciful work of our redemption was accompli&s;h|ed by his divine &s;on; and it was from hence that the light of his glorious go&s;pel was carried into all nations by his di&s;ciples and followers. Here it was
<PB N="4" REF="30">
that the fir&s;t Chri&s;tian churches were founded, the fir&s;t councils held, the fir&s;t bi&s;hoprics erected, and the Chri&s;tian faith miraculou&s;ly propagated, and watered with the blood of innumerable martyrs. La&s;tly, it was in A&s;ia that not only the fir&s;t edi|fices were reared, but likewi&s;e where the fir&s;t king|doms and monarchies were founded, whil&s;t the other parts of the world were, if at all, inhabited only by wild bea&s;ts; and as all the other parts of the world were indebted to A&s;ia for their fir&s;t inhabitants of the human &s;pecies, &s;o were they al&s;o for the &s;eeds and rudiments of many arts and &s;ciences, and even for many trees, plants, and animals: nor is it only on the&s;e accounts that this part of the world claims a &s;uperiority over the re&s;t It exceeds them al&s;o in extent, the richne&s;s and fertility of its &s;oil, the &s;erenity of its air, the deliciou&s;ne&s;s of its fruits, the &s;alubrity of its drugs, the fragrancy and bal&s;amic qualities of its plants, &s;pices, and gums: the quantity, variety, beauty, and value of its gems; the finene&s;s of its &s;ilks and cottons; the richne&s;s of its metals, and many more of the like nature: on all which accounts it was always e&s;teem|ed &s;o charming and delightful an abode, that it was the con&s;tant &s;eat of the greate&s;t monarchies in the world. It mu&s;t be owned, indeed, that a great change hath happened in that part of it called Turkey in A&s;ia, which hath quite lo&s;t its antient &s;plendor; and from the mo&s;t populous and be&s;t cultivated &s;pot in all A&s;ia, is become a wild uncul|tivated de&s;ert, and only con&s;iderable for &s;ome rich commodities it &s;till affords, on which account it is &s;till vi&s;ited and re&s;orted to by merchants of other nations. As to the other parts they continue much in their former condition, the &s;oil being as remark|able for its fertility, as mo&s;t of the inhabitants for their indolence, effeminacy, and luxury.</P>

<P><PB N="5" REF="50">
This effeminacy is chiefly owing to the warmth of the climate, tho' perhaps heightened by cu&s;tom and education; and the &s;ymptoms of it are more or le&s;s apparent, as the &s;everal nations are &s;eated nearer or farther from the north. Hence tho&s;e A&s;iatics, who live near the &s;ame latitude with us, are as brave, hardy, &s;trong, and vigorous as we. As to tho&s;e who live in the more &s;outhern regions, what is wanting in the robu&s;t frame of their bodies, &s;eems, in a great mea&s;ure, made up to them by the vivacity of their minds, and ingenuity in va|rious kinds of workman&s;hip, which our mo&s;t &s;kil|ful mechanics have in vain endeavoured to imitate.</P>
<P>The only form of government which at pre&s;ent obtains in all the parts of this exten&s;ive divi&s;ion of the globe, is ab&s;olute monarchy. If any of them can be &s;aid to enjoy &s;ome &s;hare of liberty, it is the wandering tribes, as the Tartars and Arabs. Many of the A&s;iatic nations, when the Dutch fir&s;t came among them, could not conceive how it was po&s;&s;i|ble for any people to live under a republican go|vernment, or indeed under any other form than a de&s;potic monarchy.</P>
<P>As to religion, a great part of A&s;ia is over-run with Mohammedani&s;m, as Turkey, Arabia, Per|&s;ia, part of Tartary, and India. The Per&s;ian and Indian Mohammedans are of the &s;ect of Hali, and the others of that Omar; but both own Moham|med for their lawgiver, and the Coran for their rule of faith and life. In other parts of Tartary, in China, Japan, Siam, &amp;c. they are generally hea|thens and idolaters, entertaining &s;trange notions of the deity, or rather deities, and u&s;ing the mo&s;t ex|travagant rites in their wor&s;hip of them.</P>
<P>There are two remarkable &s;ects of heathens, if they may be called &s;uch, in the Ea&s;t, namely, the Per&s;ees, Gaures, or Guebres, and the Bramins. The fir&s;t are the followers of the great Zoroa&s;ter,
<PB N="6" REF="60">
who acknowledge but one &s;upreme deity, and are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the title of Fire-wor&s;hippers, becau&s;e they wor&s;hip the element of fire, or the deity under the &s;ymbol thereof: the&s;e are enemies to all kinds of idolatry, imagery, and temples, which they look upon as derogatory to the &s;u|preme Being, who neither can, nor ought to be repre&s;ented by images, nor confined in temples. The Bramins, Brammans, or Brachmans, reckon|ed the mo&s;t con&s;iderable among the heathen &s;ects, are of a very humane di&s;po&s;ition, lead a contem|plative life, and feed only upon vegetables, being, from their notion of the tran&s;migration of &s;ouls, &s;o far from killing any living animals, either for food, plea&s;ure, or in their own defence, that they even build ho&s;pitals for the maintenance of &s;uch, e&s;pe|cially the dome&s;tic, and &s;uch as are decayed through age, accident, or other infirmities.</P>
<P>There are Chri&s;tians, or Chri&s;tian heretics, of various denominations, in A&s;ia, as Prote&s;tants, of which the number is not great, con&s;i&s;ting only of &s;uch as belong to the factories of the European nations; Roman catholics, or Latins, Armenians, Ne&s;torians, Jacobites, Maronites, and tho&s;e called Chri&s;tians of St. Thomas.</P>
<P>Though the Chri&s;tians enjoy a kind of toleration under the Mohammedan governments, yet they are expo&s;ed to much oppre&s;&s;ion, in&s;ult, and in|ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>A&s;ia is &s;ituated between the 25th and 148th de|grees of ea&s;tern longitude, and between the equa|tor and the 72d degree of north latitude. It is bounded on the we&s;t by the Mediterranean, the Black Sea, the Palus Meotis, or Sea of Azoph, and the Don, or Tanais, which &s;eparate it from Eu|rope; on the &s;outh by the Ethiopic, or Indian Ocean; on the ea&s;t by the Pacific Ocean, which &s;eparates it from America; and, on the north, by
<PB N="7" REF="70">
the Frozen Ocean: &s;o that almo&s;t on every &s;ide it is &s;urrounded by the &s;ea.</P>
<P>Having premi&s;ed thus much of A&s;ia in general, we now proceed to de&s;cribe the various countries contained in that va&s;t region, beginning from the north, as we did in Europe.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>GREAT TARTARY.</HEAD>
<P>TARTARY, or rather Tatary, in its greate&s;t extent, is &s;ituated between 57 and 160 de|grees of longitude, reckoning from the we&s;t end of the i&s;le of Ferro, and between the 37th and 55th degrees of latitude; being bounded on the north by Siberia, or that part of North A&s;ia which be|longs to Ru&s;&s;ia; on the we&s;t by the rivers Don, the Wolga, and Kama, which &s;eparate it from Ru&s;&s;ia; on the &s;outh by the Euxine and Ca&s;pian Seas, Karazm, the two Buckarias, China, and Korea; and, on the ea&s;t, by the Oriental or Tarta|rean Ocean. From this account it appears, that Tartary, or Great Tartary as we call it, is a va&s;t region, extending, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, the &s;pace of 104 degrees in longitude, or four thou&s;and one hundred and forty-five geographical miles; but its breadth is not proportionable, being not above nine hundred and &s;ixty miles where broade&s;t, and where narrowe&s;t three hundred and thirty.</P>
<P>This va&s;t region is divided into two great parts; the one called the We&s;tern, the other the Ea&s;tern Tartary.</P>
<DIV3>
<PB N="8" REF="80">
<HEAD>WESTERN TARTARY.</HEAD>
<P>We&s;tern Tartary, which is much more exten|&s;ive than the Ea&s;tern, containing 139 degrees of longitude out of 161, is inhabited by a great num|ber of nations, or tribes of people, who are called Mungls, or Mungals, by them&s;elves; and Moguls, or Tartars, indifferently, by other nations.</P>
<P>The principal mountains, or rather chains of mountains, found in this part of Great Tartary, may be divided into three cla&s;&s;es: fir&s;t, tho&s;e which run along the northern borders of it; and though, perhaps, not always contiguous, or of the &s;ame denomination, go under the general name of Ulug T&acirc;g, or Dag, that is the Great Mountain. Secondly, tho&s;e which make the &s;outhern bounds, and are called Kichug T&acirc;g, or the Le&s;&s;er Moun|tain. The third great chain is called Mount Altay, lying nearly in the middle, between the Ca&s;pian Sea and Ea&s;tern Tartary, and extending between the other two, in about the 110th degree of longi|tude.</P>
<P>The principal rivers of We&s;tern Tartary, be|&s;ides the Dnieper, Don, and Wolga, are the Ja&iuml;k, or Ya&iuml;k, and Yem, both de&s;cending from the Ulug T&acirc;g, and falling into the Ca&s;pian Sea, on the north &s;ide: the river Ili, or Khonghis, which ri&s;es out of the Kichug T&acirc;g, on the borders of Little Buckaria, and runs nort-hwe&s;t into the lake Palka&s;i, which is about forty miles long, and thirty broad, in latitude 48&deg;. longitude 97&deg;. reckoning from the i&s;le of Ferro; on this river the khan of the Eluths, or Kalmuks, u&s;ually re&s;ides: the river Irti&s;h, Irtis, or Erchis, which ri&s;es in Mount Al|tay, and runs we&s;tward, inclining to the north, between two branches of it, into the lake Say&s;an, Sa&s;&s;an, or I&s;an, called al&s;o Honhotu-Nor, ninety
<PB N="9" REF="90">
miles long from we&s;t to ea&s;t, and forty broad, in latitude 47&deg;. 30&prime;. longitude 104&deg;. from whence i&s;&s;uing again, it pa&s;&s;es north-we&s;t, through part of Siberia, and falls into the Obi, which has its &s;ource in the &s;ame mountains, about one degree to the north of that of the Irti&s;h; and &s;even or eight de|grees to the north-ea&s;t ri&s;es the Kem, or Jeni&s;ea, which runs we&s;tward for the &s;pace of &s;even or eight degrees, and then turning northward enters Siberia. The next river of note is the Selinga, which ri&s;es out of the lake Kofogol, Hut&ucirc;kt&ucirc;, or Kh&ucirc;t&ucirc;kt&ucirc;, which is &s;eventy miles long, from &s;outh to north, and twenty broad, in latitude 52&deg;. lon|gitude 118&deg;. not far from the &s;ource of the Jeni&s;ea, and taking a &s;weep &s;outhward, round by the ea&s;t, falls northward into the lake Bayk&acirc;l in Siberia, about thirty leagues north-we&s;t of the city Selinghin&s;koy, which &s;tands upon it. Into the Selinga runs the Orkon, coming from the &s;outh-we&s;t; and into the Orkon the Tula, ri&s;ing ea&s;tward in Mount Kentey. On the &s;ame mountain ri&s;es al&s;o two other rivers, viz. the Onon, called al&s;o by the Tar|tars Saghalian Ula, or the Dragon river, and by the Ru&s;&s;ians Am&ucirc;r; which running north-ea&s;t|ward, and then taking a large &s;weep by the &s;outh, rolls along the bounds of Ea&s;tern Tartary, and falls into the Ea&s;tern Ocean. On its banks &s;tand two cities, Nerchin&s;koy, or Nipchew, a frontier of the Ru&s;&s;ians, almo&s;t due north of Pekin in China, and Saghalian Ula, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Chine&s;e. An|other large rivers in the Kerlon, or Kerulon, which running north-ea&s;tward, falls into the lake Kulon, or Dalay, which is &s;ixty miles long from &s;outh|we&s;t to north-ea&s;t, and twenty-&s;even broad, in latitude 48&deg; 30&prime;. longitude 135&deg;. and i&s;&s;uing out again under the name of Ergona, or Argun, joins the Saghalian Ula, about one hundred and &s;eventy miles beyond Nerchin&s;koy. To the&s;e let us add
<PB N="10" REF="100">
the river Kalka, from whence, though &s;mall, the Kalka-Moguls, or Mongols take their name. It ri&s;es in the mountains, &s;eparating Ea&s;tern from We&s;tern Tartary, and, running we&s;tward, falls in|to the lake Puir, and then into that of Kulon, before &s;poken of.</P>
<P>Having mentioned the principal lakes of We&s;tern Tartary in our account of the rivers, we &s;hall take notice only of two more, fir&s;t, the Kami&s;h, about four hundred and eighty-four miles long, and near as many broad, in latitude 50&deg;. longitude 83&deg;. 30&prime;. The &s;econd, l&s;&s;ikol, a lake of &s;mall extent, in la|titude 46&deg;. longitude 94&deg;. 30&prime;; but renowned a|mong the inhabitants in the we&s;t of Tartary, for being the place where Turk, their great ance&s;tor, fixed his re&s;idence, or royal &s;eat.</P>
<P>As to the political &s;tate of We&s;tern Tartary we &s;hall only &s;ay in general, that it is entirely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Tartar tribes, under &s;everal khans, who&s;e do|minions are named after the people or prince who rules over them. The fir&s;t and chief of the&s;e tribes are the Eluths, nick-named Kalmuks, by the Mo|hammedan Tartars, and &s;ubdivided into &s;everal hords.</P>
<P>The Aijuka Kalmuks dominions are bounded by the river Ja&iuml;k, and extend about ten degrees ea&s;tward from that river. They are idolaters, of the religion of Tibet, or the Dalay Lama. A late traveller gives us the following account of them. "One day a party of us went to &s;ee a great hor&s;e|market held by the Kalmuks: we &s;aw about five or &s;ix hundred of the&s;e people a&s;&s;embled in a field, with a number of hor&s;es all running loo&s;e, except tho&s;e on which the Tartars were mounted. The buyers came from different parts of Ru&s;&s;ia. The Tartars had their tents pitched along the river &s;ide. Their tents are of a conical figure; there are &s;everal long poles erected inclining to one another,
<PB N="11" REF="110">
which are fixed at the top into &s;omething like a hoop, that forms the circumference of an aperture for letting out the &s;moke, or admitting the light; acro&s;s the poles are laid &s;ome &s;mall rods from four to &s;ix feet long, and fa&s;tened to them with thongs. This frame is covered with pieces of felt, made of coar&s;e wool and hair. The&s;e tents afford better &s;helter than any other kind, and are &s;o contrived, as to be &s;et up, taken down, folded, and packed up, with great ea&s;e and quickne&s;s, and &s;o light, that a camel may carry five or &s;ix of them. Where the khan, or any per&s;on of character re&s;ides, they are placed in &s;trait lines. The&s;e Tartars are &s;trong made, &s;tout men, their faces broad, no&s;es flatti&s;h, and eyes &s;mall and black, but very quick. Their dre&s;s is very &s;imple, con&s;i&s;ting of a loo&s;e coat of &s;heep-&s;kins, tied with a girdle, a &s;mall round cap, turned up with fur, having a ta&s;&s;el of red &s;ilk at the top, leather or linen-drawers, and boots; their heads are all &s;haved, except a lock behind, which is plaited, and hangs down their backs.</P>
<P>"They are armed with bows and arrows, a &s;abre and lance, which they manage with great dexterity, acquired by con&s;tant practice from their infancy. They are men of courage and re&s;olution; but much afraid of cannon, which put their hor&s;es in di&s;order. As they are always on hor&s;eback, they are excellent riders.</P>
<P>"The dre&s;s of the women differs little from that of the men, only their gowns are &s;omewhat longer than the coats of the men, a little ornamented, and bordered with party-coloured cloth; they wear ear|rings, and their hair all plaited in locks. The bet|ter &s;ort dre&s;s in &s;ilks in &s;ummer. It mu&s;t be ob|&s;erved, for the honour of their women, that they are very hone&s;t and &s;incere, and few of them lewd; adultery is a crime &s;carce ever heard of. The Tar|tars make very good and faithful &s;ervants: and
<PB N="12" REF="120">
the more mildly they are u&s;ed, the better they per|form their duty; for their wandering unconfined manner of life naturally in&s;pires them with &s;enti|ments of liberty, and aver&s;ion to tyranny and op|pre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>"All their wealth is their flocks; like tho&s;e who lived in the early ages of the world, they have camels, hor&s;es, cows, and &s;heep. The hor&s;es are of a good &s;ize for the &s;addle, and very hardy: as they run wild till they are &s;ometimes &s;ix years old, they are generally head-&s;trong. They were &s;old at this fair from five to fifteen or &s;ixteen crowns; and the &s;trong, well-&s;haped, natural pacers, much higher. They have few camels, but many dromedaries, who have two protuberances on their backs. The &s;heep are large, with broad tails, like tho&s;e in Turkey: the wool is coar&s;e, but the mut|ton very fine.</P>
<P>"In the preceding century, a Kalmuk prince, named Torgott Chorluke, came from Alack-ulla, which &s;ignifies the Spotted-mountain, a country &s;ituated between Siberia on the north, and India on the &s;outh, to the borders of Ru&s;&s;ia, and brought along with him about fifty thou&s;and families, or tents, as they &s;ometimes reckon. In his march we&s;tward to the Volga, he defeated Eyball-Ulzic, a Tartar prince, who lived in tents beyond the river Enbo. Advancing forward, he met three other Tartar chiefs, named Kitta-haptzay, Mele|bach, and Etzan, whom he al&s;o defeated, and at la&s;t &s;ettled to the ea&s;t of the Volga, under the pro|tection of the Ru&s;&s;ians. Chorluke had &s;ix &s;ons; Dangtzing, the olde&s;t, &s;ucceeded him in the go|vernment, or khan&s;hip. The pre&s;ent khan, named Aijuka, is the fourth from Chorluke, and is much e&s;teemed in the Ea&s;t for his &s;agacity and ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>"The rea&s;on why Chorluke left his own country, it is &s;aid, was a di&s;pute about the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the
<PB N="13" REF="130">
khan&s;hip. He being engaged on the weake&s;t &s;ide, and having un&s;ucce&s;sfully tried his fortune in the field, at la&s;t took the re&s;olution of abandoning his own country altogether. The&s;e people are gene|rally called the Black Calmuks, though they are not black, but only &s;warthy.</P>
<P>"They have no money, except what they get from the Ru&s;&s;ians, and their other neighbours, in exchange for cattle; with this they buy meal &s;ome|times, but mo&s;tly cloths, &s;ilks, &s;tuffs, and other apparel for their women. They have no mecha|nics, except tho&s;e who make arms. They avoid all labour, as the greate&s;t &s;lavery; there only em|ployment is tending their flocks, managing hor&s;es, and hunting If they are angry with a per&s;on, they wi&s;h he may live in one place, and work like the Ru&s;&s;ians. Their language contains none of tho&s;e horrid oaths common enough in tongues of more enlightened nations. They believe virtue leads to happine&s;s, and vice to mi&s;ery; for when de&s;ired to do what they think wrong, they reply in a proverb, "Though a knife be &s;harp, it cannot cut its own handle." On long marches, all their provi&s;ions con&s;i&s;t of chee&s;e, or rather dried curd, made up into little balls, which they drink when pounded, and mixt with water. If this kind of food fails, they have always many &s;pare hor&s;es, which they kill and eat. They broil and roa&s;t the fle&s;h before the fire, on pieces of broken arrows, and never eat it raw, as is commonly believed, un|le&s;s compelled by nece&s;&s;ity. They have indeed long thick pieces of hor&s;e fle&s;h &s;moaked, or dried in the &s;un, which they eat; but this cannot pro|perly be called raw. I have ta&s;ted &s;ome of it, and thought it not ami&s;s. As to their religion, they are downright heathens, and have many lamas or prie&s;ts, who can read and write, and are di&s;tingui&s;h|ed
<PB N="14" REF="140">
by their yellow habits. Their high-prie&s;t is called Delay-lama, and lives far to the ea&s;tward.</P>
<P>"But of all the Kalmuk khans the kontay&s;ha, or prince of the Black Kalmuks, is the mo&s;t powerful, being able to bring into the field, at a &s;hort warn|ing, one hundred thou&s;and hor&s;emen, who are all of them able-bodied men, well mounted, armed with bows and arrows, lances, and &s;abres. This is a greater number of hor&s;e than any prince, that I know of, can mu&s;ter, except the czarina, and emperor of China. The&s;e Kalmuks live in tents all the year, removing from place to place, as called by nece&s;&s;ity or inclination. This is the mo&s;t antient and plea|&s;ant manner of life. It is entertaining to hear them commi&s;erate tho&s;e who are confined to one place of abode, and obliged to &s;upport them&s;elves by labour, which they reckon the greate&s;t &s;lavery.</P>
<P>"The kontay&s;ha has always &s;ome thou&s;ands of his &s;ubjects encamped near him&s;elf, who treat him with great veneration and re&s;pect: and, in ju&s;tice to him, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that he is attentive to the in|tere&s;ts of his people, and as a&s;&s;iduous in the ad|mini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, as if they were his own chil|dren. The&s;e Kalmuks are not &s;uch &s;avage people as they are generally repre&s;ented; for I am inform|ed, a per&s;on may travel among them with greater &s;afety, both to his per&s;on and effects, than in many other countries. The kontay&s;ha's dominions ex|tend from 72 degrees of longitude, to the end of Mount Altay, in about the 102d degree.</P>
<P>"The emperor of China was &s;ome time ago en|gaged in a war with the kontay&s;ha, about &s;ome frontier towns, of which the latter took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and maintained his claim with a &s;trong army. The emperor &s;ent again&s;t him an army of three hundred thou&s;and men, under the command of his four|teenth &s;on, who is reckoned the be&s;t general of all his children. Notwith&s;tanding the &s;uperiority in
<PB N="15" REF="150">
numbers, the kontay&s;ha defeated the Chine&s;e in &s;everal actions. The emperor at la&s;t thought it be&s;t to accommodate the difference, and a peace was concluded to the &s;atisfaction of both parties. The method by which the Tartars chiefly carry on war again&s;t regular forces, is by wa&s;ting the country. This method is very antient, and practi&s;ed by all of them, from the Danube ea&s;t|ward. This circum&s;tance renders them a dread|ful enemy to regular troops, who mu&s;t thereby be deprived of all &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; while the Tartars, having always many &s;pare hor&s;es to kill, are never at a lo&s;s for provi&s;ions. I have only to add, that the kontay&s;ha mu&s;t be the &s;ame prince, who, in our European maps, is generally called the great cham of Tartary. As no Europeans travel through that country, the&s;e maps mu&s;t be very erroneous. It is, however, to be hoped that the Ru&s;&s;ians will, in time, make a more complete di&s;covery of the&s;e parts of A&s;ia."</P>
<P>In the middle of a de&s;ert, on the banks of the river Irti&s;h, is a remarkable piece of antiquity, called Sedmy Palaty, or the &s;even palaces. Some of the Tartars &s;ay, it was built by Tamerlane, called by the Tartars, Temyr-ack&s;ack, or Lame-temyr. The building, which is &s;aid to be of brick, well fini&s;hed, and &s;till entire, con&s;i&s;ts of &s;even apart|ments under one roof, from whence it has the name of the &s;even palaces; &s;everal of the&s;e rooms are filled with &s;crolls of glazed paper, fairly wrote, and many in gilt characters. Some of the &s;crolls are black, but the greate&s;t part white. The lan|guage in which they are written, is that of the Tongu&s;to or Kalmucks. The abovementioned traveller tells us, that while he was at Tobol&s;ky in Siberia, he met a &s;oldier in the &s;treet one day, with a bundle of the&s;e papers in his hand; that he bought them for a &s;mall &s;um, and kept them till
<PB N="16" REF="160">
his arrival in England, when he di&s;tributed them among his friends, particularly to that learned an|tiquarian, Sir Hans Sloane, who valued them at a high rate, and gave them a place in his celebrated mu&s;eum. Two of the&s;e &s;crolls were &s;ent, by order of the emperor Peter I. to the royal academy at Paris. The academy returned a tran&s;lation, which our author &s;ays, he &s;aw in the rarity-chamber of St. Peter&s;burg. One of them contained a com|mi&s;&s;ion to a lama or prie&s;t, and the other a form of prayer to the deity; but whether the academy's interpretation could be depended upon, we &s;hall not determine. The Tartars e&s;teem them all &s;a|cred writings, as appears from the care they take to pre&s;erve them. Perhaps they may contain &s;ome curious pieces of antiquity, particularly of antient hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Above the Sedmy Palaty, towards the &s;ource of the Irti&s;h, grows the be&s;t rhubarb in the world, without the lea&s;t culture.</P>
<P>In a plain of this country al&s;o, about eight or ten days journey from Tom&s;ky in Siberia, are found many tombs and burying-places of antient heroes, who in all probability fell in battle. The&s;e tombs are ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed by the mounds of earth and &s;tone rai&s;ed over them; the Tartars &s;ay, Tamerlane had many engagements in this country with the Kalmucks, whom he in vain en|deavoured to conquer. Many per&s;ons go from Tom&s;ky, and other parts, every &s;ummer, to the&s;e graves, which they dig up, and find among the a&s;hes of the dead con&s;iderable quantities of gold, &s;ilver, bra&s;s, and &s;ome precious &s;tones, but particu|larly hilts of &s;words and armour. They find al&s;o ornaments of &s;addles and bridles, and other trap|pings for hor&s;es; and &s;ometimes tho&s;e of elephants. Whence it appears, that when any general or per&s;on of di&s;tinction was interred, all his arms, his
<PB N="17" REF="170">
favourite hor&s;e and &s;ervant were buried with him in the &s;ame grave; this cu&s;tom prevails to this day among the Kalmucks and other Tartars, and &s;eems to be of great antiquity. It appears from the number of graves, that many thou&s;ands mu&s;t have fallen in tho&s;e places; for the people have con|tinued to dig for trea&s;ure many years, and &s;till find it unexhau&s;ted. They are, indeed, &s;ome|times interrupted, and robbed of all their booty, by parties of Kalmucks, who abhor di&s;turbing the a&s;hes of the dead. Armed men on hor&s;e-back, ca&s;t in bra&s;s, of no mean de&s;ign and workman|&s;hip, with the figures of deer, ca&s;t in pure gold, have been dug out of the&s;e tombs.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e grave-diggers told our author, while he was at Tom&s;ky, that they once di&s;covered an arched vault, where they found the remains of a man, with his bow, lance, and other arms lying on a &s;ilver table. On touching the body it fell to du&s;t. The value of the table and arms was very con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>Great quantities of a kind of ivory, called by the natives Mammons-horn, are found in this coun|try, and in Siberia, on the banks of the Oby. This horn has all the appearance of the teeth of a large elephant; but when, or how the&s;e teeth came &s;o far to the northward, where no elephants can, at pre&s;ent, &s;ub&s;i&s;t during the winter-&s;ea&s;on, is what we are unable to determine. They are commonly found on the banks of rivers, that have been wa&s;h|ed by floods. Some of them are very entire and fre&s;h, like the be&s;t ivory in all re&s;pects, excepting only the colour, which is of a yellowi&s;h hue. In Siberia they make &s;nuff-boxes, combs, and divers &s;orts of turnery ware of them. Some have been found weighing above an hundred pounds Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t con&s;iderable tribes in We&s;tern Tartary, next to the Kalmucks, are the Kalkas and Mungls,
<PB N="18" REF="180">
or Mongals, properly &s;o called. The country of the Kalkas extends ea&s;tward, from mount Altay to the &s;ource of the river K&acirc;lka, whence they de|rive their name, in the borders of Ea&s;tern Tartary, and 139th degree of longitude. The territories of the Mungls, or Mongalia, lie to the &s;outh of tho&s;e of the Kalkas, between them and the great wall of China, to which empire both nations are &s;ubject. Be&s;ides the&s;e tribes, who are idolaters, of the religion of the Delay Lama, there are others, who po&s;&s;e&s;s that part of We&s;tern Tartary, called Turke&s;tan, the original country of the Turks and Turkmans, &s;ituated to the north of Great Bukharia and Karazm, between tho&s;e countries and the dominions of the Eluths. Under We&s;tern Tartary al&s;o is comprehended Tibet, Thi|bet, or Tobbut, &s;ubject to the Delay Lama, or great high-prie&s;t of the Pagan Tartars, and Chi|ne&s;e.</P>
<P>In all the va&s;t region of We&s;tern Tartary there are but few towns, mo&s;t of the inhabitants living under tents, e&s;pecially in &s;ummer, and moving from place to place, with their flocks and herds. They generally encamp near &s;ome river, for the con|venience of water.</P>
<P>The air of this country is temperate, whole&s;ome, and plea&s;ant, being equally removed from the ex|tremes of heat and cold. As to the &s;oil, though there are many mountains, lakes, and de&s;erts in it, yet the banks of the rivers, and the plains, &s;ome of which are of great extent, are exceeding fertile. The mountains, woods, and de&s;erts abound with veni&s;on, game, and wild fowl; and the rivers and lakes both with fi&s;h and fowl. In particular, here are wild mules, hor&s;es, and dromedaries, wild boars, &s;everal kinds of deer, a &s;pecies of goats with yellow hair, &s;quirrels, foxes, an animal called hautehan, re&s;embling an elk, another called chu|lon,
<PB N="19" REF="190">
or cheli&s;on, that &s;eems to be a &s;ort of lynx, and a creature, called tael-pe, as &s;mall as an er|mine, of who&s;e &s;kins the Chine&s;e make mantles to keep out the cold. Among other birds, of ex|traordinary beauty, bred in this country, there is one called the &s;honkar, which is all over white, ex|cept the beak, wings, and tail, which are of a very fine red. Notwith&s;tanding the &s;oil in many parts of Tartary is &s;o luxuriant, yet, we are told, it does not produce a &s;ingle wood of tall trees of any kind whatever, excepting in &s;ome few places to|wards the frontiers; all the wood that is found in the heart of the country con&s;i&s;ting of &s;hrubs, which never exceed the height of a pike; and even the&s;e are rare.</P>
<P>Kamhi, who is, or was lately on the throne of China, was the fir&s;t who &s;ubdued the Mungls; which he effected more by kind u&s;age and hu|manity, than by his &s;word; for the&s;e people are great lovers of liberty. The &s;ame gentle treat|ment hath been ob&s;erved towards tho&s;e of them who are &s;ubjects of Ru&s;&s;ia: and they them&s;elves confe&s;s, that under the protection of tho&s;e two mighty empires, they enjoy more liberty, and live more at ea&s;e, than they did formerly, when entirely independent.</P>
<P>The prince of Mongalia re&s;ides about &s;ix days journey to the &s;outh-ea&s;t from Selingin&s;ky. The place is called Urga, and is near to where the ku|tuchtu, or high-prie&s;t inhabits. When the Mon|gals &s;ubmitted them&s;elves to the emperor of China, it was agreed, that their khan &s;hould &s;till maintain the name and authority of a prince over his people; but undertake no war, nor expedition, without con&s;ent of the emperor, which has &s;trictly been ob&s;erved ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that in all the va&s;t dominions of Mongalia, there is not &s;o much as a &s;ingle hou&s;e
<PB N="20" REF="200">
to be &s;een. All the people, even the prince, and high-prie&s;t, live con&s;tantly in tents, and remove with their cattle from place to place, as conve|niency requires. The&s;e people do not trouble them&s;elves with ploughing or digging the ground in any fa&s;hion, but are content with the produce of their flocks, though the &s;oil is exceeding fine, and capable, by proper culture, of producing grain of &s;everal &s;orts.</P>
<P>The kutuchtu, or high prie&s;t of the Mongals, a&s;&s;umes to him&s;elf the character of omni&s;cience, which is the interpretation of the word kutuchtu; and the people are taught to believe, that he really knows all things. As his intelligence, by means of his lamas, is very exten&s;ive, he is ea&s;ily able to impo&s;e upon the vulgar in this particular. They al&s;o believe that he is immortal; not that his body lives always, but that his &s;oul, upon the decay of an old one, immediately tran&s;migrates into &s;ome young human body, which, by certain marks, the lamas di&s;cover to be animated by the &s;oul of the kutuchtu, and he is accordingly treated as high|prie&s;t.</P>
<P>When the &s;pirit of the kutuchtu has taken po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of a new body, that is in plain Engli&s;h, when he is dead, the lamas are immediately em|ployed to di&s;cover in what part of the world this wonderful per&s;on is regenerated, or born again, as they expre&s;s it. They need, however, go to no great di&s;tance to find him; for the affair being pre|viou&s;ly concerted among the chief lamas, they &s;oon determine the choice of a &s;ucce&s;&s;or, who generally happens to be a young boy, that has been well in|&s;tructed how to behave on that occa&s;ion. When a &s;ucce&s;&s;or is pretended to be found, a company of lamas are &s;ent to examine the matter, who carry along with them many toys, &s;uch as &s;mall &s;ilver bells, and things of that nature, which be|longed
<PB N="21" REF="210">
to the former kutuchtu, intermixed with others, that did not. All the&s;e are laid before the child, who picks out &s;uch things as belonged to his predece&s;&s;or, and di&s;covers the greate&s;t fond|ne&s;s for them, but rejects with di&s;gu&s;t whatever is not genuine. Be&s;ides this trial, &s;ome que&s;tions are put to him relating to wars, or remarkable events in his former &s;tate; all which are an&s;wered to the &s;atisfaction of the conclave: whereupon he is unanimou&s;ly declared to be the &s;elf-&s;ame ku|tuchtu, is conducted with great pomp and cere|mony to Urga, and lodged in the tent of the high|prie&s;t. Till the new kutuchtu arrives at a certain age, he is entirely under the government of the lamas, and few are permitted to &s;ee him, except at a great di&s;tance, and even then it is not ea&s;y to get acce&s;s to him. It may &s;eem &s;urpri&s;ing, that in &s;o numerous an a&s;&s;embly of lamas, no intrigues &s;hould be carried on, nor di&s;putes ari&s;e among the electors; all is conducted without noi&s;e and con|tention. It is, however, imagined, that the au|thority of the prince greatly contributes to their unanimity.</P>
<P>The Mongals relate that the kutuchtu has now lived fourteen generations, and renews his age every moon; for at the new moon he appears like a youth; when &s;he is full, like a full grown man; but when near the change, he is an old man with grey hairs.</P>
<P>What they call the Urga is the court, or the place where the prince and high-prie&s;t re&s;ide, who are always encamped at no great di&s;tance from one another. They have &s;everal thou&s;and tents about them, which are removed from time to time. The Urga is much frequented by merchants from China, Ru&s;&s;ia, and other places, where all trade is carried on by barter, without money of any kind. The Chine&s;e bring hither ingots of gold, dama&s;ks,
<PB N="22" REF="220">
and other &s;ilks, cotton-&s;tuffs, tea, and &s;ome porce|lain, which are generally of an inferior quality, and proper for &s;uch a market. The Ru&s;&s;ian commo|dities are chiefly furs of all &s;orts. Rhubarb is the principal article exchanged for the&s;e goods, great quantities whereof are produced in this country without any culture. The Mongals gather and dry it in autumn; and bring it to this market, where it is bought up at an ea&s;y rate, both by the Ru&s;&s;ian and Chine&s;e merchants.</P>
<P>The kutuchtu and his lamas are all clothed in yellow, and no layman is allowed to wear this co|lour, except the prince: this mark of di&s;tinction makes them known and re&s;pected every where. They al&s;o wear about their necks a &s;tring of beads, which are u&s;ed in &s;aying their prayers. The Mon|gals believe in, and wor&s;hip one almighty Creator of all things; they hold that the kutuchtu is God's vice-gerent on earth, and that there will be a &s;tate of future rewards and puni&s;hments.</P>
<P>The delay-lama, or great pontiff of Thibet, or prie&s;t of the de&s;ert, who is reckoned &s;till &s;uperior to the kutuchtu, lives far to the &s;outh-ea&s;t of this place, among a people called Tonguts, who u&s;e a different language from the other Mongals, of whom they are a branch; but they hold the &s;ame opinions with re&s;pect to the tran&s;migration of the delay-lama, as the others do with re&s;pect to the kutuchtu, and he is elected in the &s;ame manner. What appears mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing, the&s;e two mighty lamas keep a good corre&s;pondence, and never en|croach on one another's privileges. The word delay &s;ignifies either the &s;ea or a great plain, &s;uch as this prie&s;t inhabits.</P>
<P>In the country of the Mongals the gra&s;s is very thick and rank, and would, with little labour, make excellent hay. This gra&s;s is often &s;et on fire by the Mongals in the &s;pring, during high winds.
<PB N="23" REF="230">
At &s;uch times it burns mo&s;t furiou&s;ly, running like wild-fire, and &s;preading its flames to the di&s;|tance of perhaps ten or twenty miles, till its pro|gre&s;s is interrupted by &s;ome river, or barren hill. The rapidity of tho&s;e flames, their &s;moke, and crackling noi&s;e, cannot ea&s;ily be conceived by tho&s;e who have not &s;een them. When any per&s;on finds him&s;elf to the leeward of them, the only method, by which he can &s;ave him&s;elf from their fury, is to kindle immediately the gra&s;s, where he &s;tands, and follow his own fire. For this purpo&s;e every per&s;on is provided with flints, &s;teel, and tinder. The rea&s;on why the Mongals &s;et fire to the gra&s;s, is to procure early pa&s;ture to their cattle. The a&s;hes left upon the gra&s;s &s;ink into the earth at the melting of the &s;now, and prove an excellent ma|nure; &s;o that the gra&s;s in the &s;pring ri&s;es on the lands, which have been prepared in this manner, as thick as a field of wheat. Caravans, travellers with merchandize, but e&s;pecially armies, never encamp upon this rank gra&s;s; and there are &s;e|veral in&s;tances of con&s;iderable bodies of men being put in confu&s;ion, and even defeated, by the enemy's &s;etting fire to the gra&s;s.</P>
<P>Mongalia, as we ob&s;erved above, produces the be&s;t rhubarb in the world. On the hills where it is found are a great number of animals, called marmots, which are very common on the Alps. Wherever ten or twenty plants of rhubarb are &s;een growing, there one is &s;ure of finding &s;everal of the&s;e animals burrows, under the &s;hades of their broad &s;preading leaves. The gentleman to whom we are indebted for mo&s;t of what we have related of the Tartars, ob&s;erves, that tho' the marmots may &s;ome|times eat the leaves and roots of the plant, yet it is probable, that the manure they leave about the root, contributes not a little to its increa&s;e; and that their ca&s;ting up the earth, makes it &s;hoot out young
<PB N="24" REF="240">
buds and multiply. This plant does not run, and &s;pread it&s;elf like docks, and others of the &s;ame &s;pecies; but grows in tufts, at uncertain di&s;tances, as if the &s;eeds had been dropped without de&s;ign. It appears that the Mongals never accounted it worth cultivating; but that the world is obliged to the marmots for the quantities &s;cattered at random in many parts of this country: for whatever part of the ripe &s;eed happens to be blown among the thick gra&s;s, can very &s;eldom reach the ground, but mu&s;t either wither or die; whereas, when it falls among the loo&s;e earth, thrown up by the marmots, it immediately takes root, and produces a new plant.</P>
<P>After digging and gathering the rhubarb, the Mongals cut the large roots into &s;mall pieces, in order to make them dry more readily. In the middle of every piece they &s;coope a hole, thro' which a cord is drawn, in order to hang them up in any convenient place. For the mo&s;t part they are hung about their tents, and &s;ometimes on the horns of their &s;heep. This is a mo&s;t pernicious cu&s;tom, as it de&s;troys &s;ome of the be&s;t part of the root, for all about the hole is rotten and u&s;ele&s;s; whereas were they rightly informed how to dig and dry this plant, there would not be one pound lo&s;t in an hundred, which would &s;ave a great deal of trouble and expence, that mu&s;t dimin&s;h the pro|fits on this commodity. At pre&s;ent, the dealers in this article think the&s;e improvements not worth their attention, as their gains are more con&s;ider|able on this than on any other branch of trade.</P>
<P>As to the Kalkas, and other tribes, they differ but little in any re&s;pect from tho&s;e we have de|&s;cribed, except that, in Turke&s;tan, they are mo&s;tly Mohammedans.</P>

<HEAD>EASTERN TARTARY.</HEAD>
<P>Ea&s;tern Tartary, according to the limits u&s;ually a&s;&s;igned it by hi&s;torians and geographers, is bound|ed to the we&s;t by We&s;tern Tartary, or by that part po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the proper Mungls and Kalkas; on the north by Siberia; on the ea&s;t by that part of the Oriental Ocean called the Tartarian Sea; and on the &s;outh by the &s;ame &s;ea, the kingdom of Korea, and the Yellow Sea, which &s;eparates it from China. It is &s;ituated between the 137th and the 160th degrees of longitude, being about nine hundred miles long from &s;outh to north, and near as many in breadth from we&s;t to ea&s;t, yet but thin|ly peopled.</P>
<P>This large region is at pre&s;ent divided into three great governments, all &s;ubject to the Chine&s;e, viz. Shin-yang, or Mugden, Kirin-ula, and T&s;it&s;ikar.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>The Government of SHIN-YANG.</HEAD>
<P>This government, containing all the antient Lyau-tong, or Quan-tong, is bounded on the &s;outh by the great wall of China, and the Yellow Sea; on the ea&s;t, north, and we&s;t, it is in|clo&s;ed by a wooden pali&s;ade, &s;even or eight feet high, fitter to mark its bounds, and keep out petty robbers, than to oppo&s;e an army.</P>
<P>The lands of this province are, for the general, very fertile, producing abundance of wheat, millet, roots, and cotton. They al&s;o afford pa&s;ture to great numbers of &s;heep and oxen, which are rarely &s;een in any of the provinces of China. They have indeed but little rice; yet, to make amends, there is plenty of apples, pears, hazel-nuts, filberds, and che&s;nuts, even in the fore&s;ts. The ea&s;tern part, which borders on the antient country of the Man|chews,
<PB N="26" REF="260">
and kingdom of Korea, is full of de&s;erts and bogs.</P>
<P>The principal cities of this government are Shing|yang, or Mugden, Fong-whang-ching, Inden, Ichew, and Kingchew.</P>
<P>This country was the original &s;eat of the Tar|tar tribe of the Manchews, who have been ma&s;ters of China above a hundred years.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>The Government of KIRIN-ULA-HOTUN.</HEAD>
<P>This &s;econd government is bounded we&s;t|ward by the pali&s;ade of Lyau-tong; on the ea&s;t by the Ea&s;tern Ocean; &s;outhward by the king|dom of Korea, and on the north by the great river Saghalian: &s;o that it extends in latitude no fewer than 12 degrees, and almo&s;t 20 degrees in longi|tude, being &s;even hundred and fifty miles in length, and &s;ix hundred in breadth.</P>
<P>This va&s;t country abounds in millet and oats, with a &s;ort of grain unknown in Europe, called, by the Chine&s;e, May-&s;em-mi, as being of a middle kind, between wheat and rice. It is whole&s;ome, and much u&s;ed in tho&s;e cold regions. There is but little wheat or rice here; but whether that is the fault of the &s;oil, or the inhabitants, we can|not a&s;&s;ert.</P>
<P>The cold begins much &s;ooner in the&s;e parts than at Paris, who&s;e latitude is near 50 degrees. The fore&s;ts, which are very thick and large, the nearer you advance to the Ea&s;tern Ocean, contribute not a little to bring it on, and keep it up.</P>
<P>The banks of the rivers here, in &s;ummer, are enamelled with a variety of flowers, common in Europe, excepting the yellow lillies, which are of a mo&s;t lively colour, in height and &s;hape exactly re&s;embling our white lillies, but, like the ro&s;es, are of a much weaker &s;cent.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="270">
But the plant, which is mo&s;t e&s;teemed, and draws a great number of herbali&s;ts into the&s;e de|&s;erts, is the Jin-&s;eng, called by the Manchews, Orhota; that is the chief or queen of plants. It is highly valued for its virtues in curing &s;everal di&s;ea&s;es, and all decays of &s;trength, proceeding from exce&s;&s;ive labour of body or mind. For this rea&s;on it has always been the principal riches of Ea&s;tern Tartary; what is found in the north of Korea being con&s;umed in that kingdom.</P>
<P>Formerly the Chine&s;e u&s;ed to get into the Jin-&s;eng country, among the mandarins and &s;oldiers continually pa&s;&s;ing; but, in 1709, the emperor Kang-hi, that his Manchews might reap this ad|vantage, ordered ten thou&s;and of his &s;oldiers, en|camped without the great wall, to go and gather it, on condition that each &s;hould give him two ounces of the be&s;t, and take an equal weight of fine &s;ilver for the remainder: by which means the em|peror got, in that year, twenty thou&s;and pounds of it for le&s;s than one-fourth of the price it bears at Pekin.</P>
<P>This plant grows only on the declivity of woody mountains, on the banks of deep rivers, or about &s;teep rocks. It cannot bear much heat or cold, for it grows not beyond the 47th degree of latitude; and if a fore&s;t takes fire, it appears no more there in three or four years. It is ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed from all other plants about it, and frequently by a clu&s;ter of very round and red fruit, or a &s;talk that &s;hoots above the branches. The root is the only part that is u&s;ed medicinally. Its value is en|hanced by its age, for the large&s;t and firme&s;t are the be&s;t. This country abounds al&s;o in fine &s;ables, grey ermines, and black foxes.</P>
<P>One of the tribes of Tartars inhabiting this coun|try, are called the Yu-pi Tartars, who&s;e manner of life is &s;omewhat extraordinary. All the &s;ummer
<PB N="28" REF="280">
they &s;pend in fi&s;hing: one part of what they catch is laid up to make oil for their lamps; an|other &s;erves for their daily food; and the re&s;t, which they dry in the &s;un, without &s;alting, for they have no &s;alt, is laid up for their winter's provi&s;ions, whereof both men and cattle eat, when the rivers are frozen. Notwith&s;tanding this diet, a great deal of &s;trength and vigour appears in mo&s;t of the&s;e poor people. Their raiment con&s;i&s;ts of the &s;kins of fi&s;h, which, after dre&s;&s;ing and dying of three or four colours, they &s;hape, and &s;ew in &s;o delicate a manner, that one would imagine they made u&s;e of &s;ilk, till, on ripping a &s;titch or two, you perceive an exceeding fine thong, cut out of a very thin &s;kin. When the rivers are frozen, their &s;ledges are drawn by dogs, trained up for the purpo&s;e, and highly valued.</P>
<P>Although the Manchew language is as much u&s;ed at the court of Pekin as the Chine&s;e, and all public acts are drawn up in the one as well as the other; yet it began to decline, and would proba|bly have been lo&s;t, had not the Tartars taken great pains to pre&s;erve it, by tran&s;lating Chine&s;e books, and compiling Dictionaries, under the emperor's patronage. Their language is &s;ingular in this re|&s;pect, that the verb differs as often as the &s;ub&s;tan|tive governed by it; or, which is the &s;ame thing, to every different &s;ub&s;lantive they u&s;e a different verb: as for in&s;tance, when they would &s;ay, <HI>make a ver&s;e, a picture, a &s;tatue;</HI> for though the re|petition of the &s;ame verb in di&s;cour&s;e might be ex|cu&s;able, it is with them unpardonable in writing, as making a mon&s;trous grating to their ears.</P>
<P>Another &s;ingularity of their language is the co|piou&s;ne&s;s of it: for in&s;tance, be&s;ides names for each &s;pecies of animals, they have words to ex|pre&s;s their &s;everal ages and qualities. Judagon is the general name for a dog; but tayha &s;ignifies a
<PB N="29" REF="290">
dog who has very long and thick hair both on his ears and tail; and yolo, a dog with a long thick muzzle and tail, large ears, and hanging lips. The hor&s;e, as more &s;erviceable to them, has twenty times more names than the dog; almo&s;t every mo|tion of him giving occa&s;ion to a different name. Where they could get that a&s;toni&s;hing multitude of names and terms is not ea&s;y to determine.</P>
<P>On the we&s;t are the Mungls, but in the two languages there are &s;carcely eight words alike. They under&s;tand nothing of the language of a few &s;avage nations on the ea&s;t and north. As to the Koreans, their language and letters being Chine&s;e, have no re&s;emblance to the Manchews. It is &s;aid, they have above &s;ixty letters in their alphabet, but only one &s;ort of character. They write from the top to the bottom of the paper, like the Chine&s;e, but four different ways, according to the occa&s;ion, as in other countries. They commonly write with a pencil, though &s;ome u&s;e a kind of bambu pen; but the pencil holds ink better, and moves more freely on the paper. The Manchews think their language the mo&s;t elegant, as well as the mo&s;t copious, in the world; and imagine there is no rendering the &s;en&s;e of it, much le&s;s the maje&s;ty of its &s;tile, in any other language: yet they cannot expre&s;s all &s;ounds, as they want the letters B and D, u&s;ing P and T in their &s;tead; nor can write words in which two con&s;onants come together, without in&s;erting a vowel between them. Their tran&s;itions likewi&s;e are &s;o few, that they are much puzzled how to connect their written di&s;cour&s;es. In other re&s;pects it mu&s;t be allowed to be a ma&s;terly language, and as full of terms, perhaps, as the Arabic it&s;elf.</P>
<P>This country is but thinly peopled, and contains only four cities, namely, Kirinula hotun, or Kho|tun, Pedne, or Petuna, Ning&ucirc;ta, and Putay-ula|hotun,
<PB N="30" REF="300">
which are very ill-built, and encompa&s;&s;ed with no better than mud walls. The fir&s;t &s;tands on the river Songari, and is the re&s;idence of the Manchew general, who has all the privileges of a viceroy, and commands the mandarins, as well as the troops. Ning&ucirc;ta, which the family now reign|ing in China con&s;iders as its antient patrimony, is &s;ituated on the H&ucirc;rkapira, which runs northward into the Songari. Its name is compounded of two Tartarian words, which &s;ignify &s;even chiefs, to ex|pre&s;s the ri&s;e of the Manchew kingdom, which was fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed by &s;even brothers of the late em|peror Kanghi's great-grand-father's father.</P>
<P>The tribe of the Manchews, who inhabit a part of Ea&s;tern Tartary, and are lords of all the other inhabitants thereof, are called by the Ru&s;&s;ians, Bogdoy; and the emperor of China, Bogdoy khan, and Amulon Bogdoy khan.</P>

<HEAD>The Government of TSITSIKAR.</HEAD>
<P>The third government, into which Ea&s;tern Tar|tary is divided, is that of T&s;it&s;ikar. It is &s;even hundred and forty miles long, and &s;ix hundred broad, and belongs partly to China, and partly to Ru&s;&s;ia. The people are great hunters, dextrous archers, and pay their tribute in &s;able &s;kins; each family being a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed two or three, or more a-year, according to the number of able per&s;ons.</P>
<P>This province is inhabited chiefly by three &s;orts of Tartars, the Manchews, the Solons, and Tag&ucirc;ri, of whom the fir&s;t are ma&s;ters. The Tag&ucirc;ri are a large robu&s;t people, but not very numerous. They live in hou&s;es, or huts, and cultivate barley, oats, and millet. Their cattle are principally hor&s;es, dromedaries, oxen, cows, and &s;heep. They make much u&s;e of their oxen to ride on.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="310">
The Solons al&s;o are a brave robu&s;t people. Their dre&s;s is a &s;hort jacket of wolves &s;kins, with a cap of the &s;ame, and they have long cloaks, made of fox or tygers &s;kins, to defend them again&s;t the cold, e&s;pecially of the night. They hang their bows at their backs. Their women ride on hor&s;e|back, drive the plough, hunt &s;tags, and other game.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the country towns or villages, there are three cities in the province of T&s;it&s;ikar, namely, T&s;it&s;ikar, Merghen, and Saghalian-ula-hotun. The garri&s;on of T&s;it&s;ikar, the capital, con&s;i&s;ts of Man|chews; but the inhabitants are mo&s;tly Chine&s;e. According to their own account, they are all &s;ham|mans, or conjurors, and invoke the devil with frightful cries. They give their dead two burials, fir&s;t leaving a hole at top of the grave, where the relations daily bring victuals, which they convey to the mouth of the decea&s;ed with a &s;poon, and leave drink in &s;mall tin cups, &s;tanding round the grave. This ceremony holds for &s;everal weeks, after which they bury the body deeper in the ground.</P>
<P>Several rivers in this country produce pearls, which, though much cried up by the Tartars, would be little valued by Europeans, on account of their defects in &s;hape and colour.</P>
<P>The kingdoms, or countries of Corea, Lyau|tong, and Nyu-che, forming a part of Katay, Kitay, or Cathay, and by &s;ome included under Ea&s;tern Tartary, are more properly provinces of China, tho' they lie without the great wall.</P>

<HEAD>The KINGDOM of KARASM.</HEAD>
<P>This kingdom, which was known to the antient Greeks, as appears from Herodotus, Ptolemy, and other authors of that nation, by the name of Khora&s;|mia, is at pre&s;ent bounded on the north by the country of Turke&s;tan, and the dominions of the great khan of the Eluths, or Kalmuks; on the ea&s;t by Great Buckharia, from which it is &s;eparated partly by the mountains of Irdar, and partly by the de&s;erts of Karak and G&acirc;znah; on the &s;outh by the provinces of A&s;terab&acirc;d and Khora&s;&s;an, belong|ing to Ir&acirc;n, or Per&s;ia at large, from which it is divided by the river Iih&ucirc;n, or Amu, and &s;undry de&s;erts of a va&s;t extent; and on the we&s;t by the Ca&s;pian Sea.</P>
<P>It may be about four hundred and forty miles in length from &s;outh to north, and three hundred from we&s;t to ea&s;t; being &s;ituated between the 39th and 46th degrees of north lat. and the 71&s;t and 77th degrees of ea&s;t long. The country con&s;i&s;ts, for the mo&s;t part, of va&s;t &s;andy plains, &s;ome of which are barren de&s;erts, but others afford excel|lent pa&s;ture. There is good land in &s;everal of the provinces, where vines grow, and wine is made; but water being &s;carce, a great part of the country turns to no account.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="330">
The melons here, called arb&ucirc;s, or karb&ucirc;s, are the true water-melons. They are of the &s;ize of ordinary gourds, or pompions; commonly round and green on the out&s;ide, but within of a much deeper colour than the common melons, al|though &s;ome are perfectly white; but the&s;e are not the be&s;t. Their &s;eed is quite black, and &s;haped like that of the pompion, but rounder. It is al&s;o tran&s;parent, and di&s;per&s;ed all through the fruit; the whole of which is eaten, except the rind and &s;eed. The &s;ub&s;tance is much finer, and of a better flavour, than that of ordinary melons. It is ex|ceedingly cooling, and one may eat as much as he will, without the lea&s;t danger. The fruit which is well gathered green, and ripens afterwards, will keep a long time, and are as good in the middle of winter, as in their proper &s;ea&s;on. They carry them from A&s;tracan, where they are near as good as in Kara&s;m, to St. Peter&s;burg, for the court of Ru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>Kara&s;m owes all its fertility to three rivers and a lake. The rivers are the Am&ucirc;, Khe&s;il, and S&icirc;r. The Am&ucirc;, as it is called by the U&s;becks and Per&s;ians, is the Jih&ucirc;n of the Arabs, and Oxus of the antient Greeks. It has its &s;ource in tho&s;e high mountains, which &s;eparate Little Bukharia from the dominions of the Great Mogul; and, after pa&s;&s;ing through Great Bukharia and Kora&s;m, di|vides into two branches, one of which falls into the Khe&s;il, and the other into the Ca&s;pian Sea, to|wards the borders of the province of A&s;tarab&acirc;d. The Am&ucirc; abounds with all &s;orts of excellent fi&s;h, and its banks are the mo&s;t charming in the world. Along them grows tho&s;e excellent melons, and other fruits, &s;o much e&s;teemed in Per&s;ia, the Indies, and Ru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>The river Khe&s;il ri&s;es in the mountains to the north-ea&s;t of the province of Samarkant, and falls
<PB N="34" REF="340">
into the lake of Ar&acirc;l, or Eagles, fifty or &s;ixty miles below its junction with a branch of the Am&ucirc;. Its banks are exceeding fertile, wherever they are cultivated.</P>
<P>The S&icirc;r, or Daria, ri&s;es in the mountains to the ea&s;t of Little Bukharia, and after a long cour&s;e we&s;tward, along the borders of the Bukharias and Kara&s;m, falls at la&s;t into the lake Ar&acirc;l.</P>
<P>The lake of Ar&acirc;l, that is of Eagles, &s;eparates the province of Ar&acirc;l, to which it gives name, from the ea&s;tern provinces of Kara&s;m. It is one of the large&s;t in the north of A&s;ia, being above eighty German leagues in circumference: its waters are exceeding &s;alt, and breed great quantities of the &s;ame &s;orts of fi&s;h as are found in the Ca&s;pian &s;ea.</P>
<P>Kara&s;m is at pre&s;ent inhabited by three &s;orts of people, the Sarts, Turkmans, and U&s;beck Tartars. With regard to the fir&s;t of the&s;e, we are told, that they are the antient inhabitants of the country, or tho&s;e who were &s;ettled there before the U&s;becks became ma&s;ters of it, and that they &s;upport them|&s;elves, like the Turkmans, by their cattle and hu&s;|bandry. The Turkmans, or Turkomans, came originally from Turke&s;tan, or the parts of Tartary to the north of Kara&s;m and Great Bukharia, to|wards the eleventh century. They divided into two parties, one of which went round the north|&s;ide of the Ca&s;pian Sea, and &s;ettled in the we&s;tern parts of the Greater Armenia, from thence called Turkomania, or the country of the Turkomans. The &s;econd party turned &s;outh, and re&s;ted about the banks of the river Am&ucirc;, and the &s;hores of the Ca&s;pian Sea, where they &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;s a great many towns and villages, in the countries of Kara&s;m and A&s;tarab&acirc;d.</P>
<P>The Turkomans &s;eem to be de&s;cended from the Turks, or to differ from them only, as the wander|ing Arabs, called Bedwins, who live under tents, do from tho&s;e who dwell in cities. Tho&s;e of Ka|ra&s;m
<PB N="35" REF="350">
are &s;haped much like the We&s;tern, that is, are tall and robu&s;t, with &s;quare flat faces; only they are much &s;warthier, and have a greater re&s;emblance of the Tartars. In &s;ummer they wear long gowns of calico, or thick cloth; and, in winter, &s;heep-&s;kin gowns of the &s;ame kind. Cattle and agriculture afford them &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. In winter they inhabit towns and villages about the river Am&ucirc;, and to|wards the coa&s;ts of the Ca&s;pian Sea. In &s;ummer they encamp where they can find the be&s;t pa&s;tures, and good water. They profe&s;s all the Mohamme|dan religion, but do not give them&s;elves much trouble about the practice of it. They are very brave, and at lea&s;t as good hor&s;emen as the U&s;becks, by whom, being treated as conquered &s;ubjects, they are obliged to pay tribute, and &s;uffer &s;everal other impo&s;itions. To this is principally to be imputed the great animo&s;ity which they bear tho&s;e rigid ma&s;ters; but the Turkomans, who live under the dominion of the Per&s;ians, are treated in a much better manner. Both together may amount to one hundred thou&s;and families. The&s;e people are &s;till divided into tribes, like all the other branches of the Turki&s;h nation, and their chief enjoys the &s;ame prerogatives.</P>
<P>The name of U&s;becks, which the ruling tribe of the Tartars of Kara&s;m and Great Bukharia bear at pre&s;ent, is derived from one of their khans. The U&s;becks of Kara&s;m are divided into &s;everal hords, and live, for the mo&s;t part, by rapine, re&s;embling, in all re&s;pects, tho&s;e of Great Bukharia, excepting that they are much more rude and uncivilized. Like the Turkmans they dwell in winter, in the towns and villages, which are towards the middle of Ko|ra&s;m; and, in &s;ummer, the greater part of them encamp in the neighbourhood of the Am&ucirc;, or in other places, where they can meet with pa&s;ture for their cattle, always watching for &s;ome con|venient
<PB N="36" REF="360">
opportunity to rob and plunder. They never cea&s;e making incur&s;ions upon the adjacent territories of Per&s;ia, or Great Bukharia, and are to be re&s;trained by no treaties or engagements what&s;oever. Although they have fixed habitations, yet, in travelling from one place to another, they carry with them all their effects of value, conform|able to the way of living in u&s;e among their ance&s;|tors, before they had &s;ettled dwellings.</P>
<P>The&s;e Tartars, it is &s;aid, never ride without their bow, arrows, and &s;word, although it be in hawking, or taking any other diver&s;ion. They have no arts nor &s;ciences among them, neither do they till or &s;ow. They are great devourers of fle&s;h, which they cut in &s;mall pieces, and eat greedily by handfuls, e&s;pecially hor&s;e-fle&s;h.</P>
<P>Their chief drink is &s;our mare's milk, like that in u&s;e with the Nogays. They eat their victuals upon the ground, &s;itting with their legs double under them; which is their po&s;ture al&s;o when they pray.</P>
<P>All the&s;e tribes have abundance of camels, hor&s;es, and &s;heep, both wild and tame. Their &s;heep are extraordinary large, with great tails, weighing &s;ixty or eighty pounds. There are many wild hor&s;es in the country, which the Tartars frequent|ly kill with their hawks. The&s;e birds are taught to &s;eize upon the head or neck of the bea&s;t, which being tired with toiling, to get rid of this cruel ene|my, the hunter, who follows his game, comes up and kills him. Some travellers tell us, that the inhabitants of this country have not the u&s;e of gold, &s;ilver, or any other coin, but barter their cattle for nece&s;&s;aries. Others tell us, that they have money, particularly a piece of &s;ilver called tanga, the value near the fourth-part of a crown. It is round, and has on one &s;ide the name of the country, and on the other, that of the country, with the year of the

hejrah. There are al&s;o, it is &s;aid, &s;mall pieces of copper, of different &s;izes, which an&s;wer to our pence, half-pence, and farthings.</P>
<P>As to the government of Kara&s;m, the U&s;becks being ma&s;ters, it is commonly ve&s;ted in divers princes of that tribe of the &s;ame hou&s;e, of whom, notwith&s;tanding, only one has the title of khan, with a kind of &s;uperiority over the others. This khan has no &s;ort of dependence on him of Great Bukharia, or any other prince.</P>

<HEAD>BUKHARIA.</HEAD>
<P>Bukharia, Bokharia, Bokaria, Bogaria, or Bo|haria, is the name given to all that region, or tract of land, lying between Kara&s;m and the Great Kobi, or Sandy De&s;ert, bordering on China. It is di|vided into the Great and Little Bukharia.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>GREAT BUKHARIA,</HEAD>
<P>Which &s;eems to comprehend the Sogdiana and Bactriana of the antient Greeks and Romans, with their dependencies, is &s;ituated between the 34th and 46th degrees of latitude, and between the 76th and 46th degrees of longitude. It is bounded on the north by the river S&icirc;r, which &s;eparates it from the dominions of the Eluths, or Kalmuks; by the kingdom of Ka&s;hgar, in Little Bukharia, on the ea&s;t; by the dominions of the Great Mogul and Per&s;ia on the &s;outh; and by the country of Kara&s;m on the we&s;t: being about &s;even hundred and &s;even|ty miles long from we&s;t to ea&s;t, and &s;even hundred and thirty miles broad from &s;outh to north.</P>
<P>According to Bentink, nature has denied no|thing to this fine country to render it agreeable: the mountains abound with the riche&s;t mines; the vallies are of an a&s;toni&s;hing fertility in all &s;orts of
<PB N="38" REF="380">
fruits and pul&s;e; the fields are covered with gra&s;s the height of a man; the rivers &s;warm with excel|lent fi&s;h; and wood, which is &s;carce all over We&s;tern Tartary, is found here in great plenty: in &s;hort, it is the mo&s;t fruitful, and be&s;t inha|bited of all the Northern A&s;ia. But all the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings are of very little u&s;e to the Tartar inhabi|tants, who are naturally &s;o lazy, that they would rather go rob and kill their neighbours, than ap|ply them&s;elves to improve the benefits which na|ture &s;o liberally offers them.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Great Bukharia are of three &s;orts: 1. The Bukhars, who are the antient inha|bitants, and po&s;&s;e&s;s all the great towns, both of Great and Little Bukharia. 2d, The Jagatays, or Mungls, who &s;ettled there under Jagatay khan, &s;econd &s;on of Jengh&icirc;z khan: and, 3d, The U&s;beck Tartars, who are at pre&s;ent ma&s;ters of the country, though tributary to Per&s;ia, at lea&s;t they were &s;o in the reign of &s;hah Nadir.</P>
<P>The Bukhars are well &s;et, and very fair, con|&s;idering the climate, have generally large eyes, black and lively, their faces are well &s;haped, their no&s;es hawked, hair black, and very fine, and their beards thick. In &s;hort, they have nothing of the deformity which appears in the Tartars, among whom they inhabit. The women are generally large, and well &s;haped, with fine complexions, and very beautiful features.</P>
<P>Both men and women u&s;e calico &s;hifts and drawers, over which the men wear a ve&s;t of quilted &s;ilk, or calico, which reaches to the mid-leg, and is tied about the middle by a &s;ilk crape girdle. When they go abroad, they fling over it a long cloth gown, faced, and even lined in winter, with fur. Their head is covered with a round cloth bonner, like the Poli&s;h, with a large fur border; &s;ome wear turbans like the Turks. Their boots are
<PB N="39" REF="390">
made like Per&s;ian bu&s;kins, of hor&s;e-hides prepared for the purpo&s;e. The women wear long gowns, full, and loo&s;e, of the &s;ame materials. They let their hair hang in tre&s;&s;es, adorned with pearls and other jewels. Their bonnet is &s;mall, flat, and coloured; and their &s;lippers like tho&s;e worn in the north of the Indies.</P>
<P>All the Bukhars profe&s;s the Mohammedan reli|gion, nearly after the Turki&s;h form, excepting in &s;ome few ceremonies. They live by following mechanic trades or commerce, which is wholly in their hands: but as foreign merchants &s;eldom come among them, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e parts where the Mahommedan Tartars are ma&s;ters, they re&s;ort in numerous caravans to China, the Indies, Per&s;ia, and Siberia, where they traffic to con&s;iderable ad|vantage. Although they po&s;&s;e&s;s all the towns in the&s;e provinces, they never meddle with arms, leaving the bu&s;ine&s;s of war and government to the Eluths, or Kalmuks, and U&s;beck Tartars, who are ma&s;ters, the latter of Great, and the former of Little Bukharia, to whom they pay tribute, which is regulated every year. On this account the Tartars de&s;pi&s;e them, as a cowardly, &s;imple people. They are not divided into tribes, like the Tartars, and many other ea&s;tern nations.</P>
<P>The Jagatays and U&s;becks, though originally different tribes, are now compri&s;ed under the ge|neral name of U&s;becks.</P>
<P>The U&s;becks are generally reputed the mo&s;t ci|vilized of all the Mohammedan Tartars, although they are great robbers, like the re&s;t. They are cloathed, men and women, like the Per&s;ians, but not &s;o neatly; and the chief of them wear a plume of white heron feathers on their turbans. Their mo&s;t delicious victuals are pillaw (which is rice &s;odden in broth) and hor&s;e-fle&s;h. Their common drink is kumis or kammez, and arak, both made
<PB N="40" REF="400">
of mares milk. Their language is a mixture of the Turki&s;h, Per&s;ian, and Mungl tongues. Their arms are much the &s;ame with tho&s;e u&s;ed by the re&s;t of the Tartars, viz. the &s;abre, the dart, the lance, and the bow, of a larger &s;ize than ordinary, which they manage with much &s;trength and dex|terity They have u&s;ed mu&s;kets for &s;ome time pa&s;t, after the Per&s;ian manner. When they go to war, a great part of their cavalry wear coats of mail, and a little buckler to defend them. The U&s;becks are commonly a$ war with the Per&s;ians, their incur|&s;ions being encouraged by the fine plains of Kho|ra&s;&s;an. Such of them as feed on their cattle, live under portable huts, like their neighbours the Kalmuks: but they who cultivate lands, dwell in the villages and hamlets, very few of them living in the cities or towns, which are all po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Bukhars, or antient inhabitants.</P>
<P>Great Bukharia is divided into three large pro|vinces, namely, Proper Bukharia, Samarkant, and Balk, each of which has commonly its particular khan; although &s;ometimes one, by conque&s;t, is ma&s;ter of two provinces.</P>
<P>The province of Proper Bukharia is the mo&s;t we&s;tern of the three, extending about three hun|dred and ninety miles in length, and three hundred and twenty in breadth. Bokhara, or Boghar, its capital, is &s;ituated in 30&deg;. 10&prime;. of latitude, twenty days journey from Urkenj, the capital of Kara&s;m. The khan re&s;ides here in a ca&s;tle. A little river runs through the city, who&s;e water is very bad, breeding in the legs of &s;uch as drink it, worms an ell long, between the fle&s;h and the &s;kin, which, workin$ out about an inch every day, are rolled up, and extracted; but if they break in the opera|tion, the patient dies. The metropolitan, or head of the law, al&s;o re&s;ides here, who is more obeyed than the khan him&s;elf; the latter being often de|po&s;ed
<PB N="41" REF="410">
by him, and put to death. There is a great re&s;ort of karaw&acirc;ns to Bokhara from India, Per&s;ia, Balk, and Ru&s;&s;ia. The principal commodities they carry from hence are wrought &s;ilks, red hides, &s;laves, hor&s;es, and &s;uch like.</P>
<P>The province of Samarkant lies to the ea&s;t of Proper Bukharia, being about five hundred and forty miles long from we&s;t to ea&s;t, and five hun|dred broad from &s;outh to north. The capital of this province, and indeed of all Bukharia, taken in the large&s;t &s;en&s;e, is Samarkant, or Samarkand, &s;itu|ated &s;even days journey to the north-ea&s;t of Bok|hara, on a river and valley, both which bear the name of Sogd, from whence the Sogdiana of the antients had its denomination. It is a very large populous city. The academy of &s;ciences in this city is one of the mo&s;t eminent among the Moham|medans, who re&s;ort thither to &s;tudy from all the neighbouring countries. The &s;ilk-paper made here is &s;aid to be the mo&s;t beautiful in all A&s;ia, and there|fore in great reque&s;t throughout the Ea&s;t. The neighbouring country produces pears, apples, rai|&s;ins, and melons of an exqui&s;ite ta&s;te, and in &s;uch plenty, that the empire of the Great Mogul, and part of Per&s;ia, are &s;upplied with them.</P>
<P>Otr&acirc;r, called by the Arabs Farab, and &s;ituated in the north-we&s;t part of this province, is famous for the death of Timur Beg, or Tamarlane, in 1405.</P>
<P>The province of Balk, or Balkh, lies to the &s;outh of the province of Samarkand, and ea&s;t of Proper Bukharia. It is about three hundred and &s;ixty miles long, and two hundred and fifty broad. Tho' the &s;malle&s;t, it is by much the mo&s;t fertile, and be&s;t cultivated of the three, abounding particularly in &s;ilk, of which the inhabitants make very pretty manufactures. In the mountains, towards Hin|d&ucirc;&s;tan, are mines of gold, &s;ilver, and rubies, with quarries of lapis lazuli. The U&s;becks, &s;ubject to
<PB N="42" REF="420">
the khan of Balk, are the mo&s;t civilized of all the Tartars inhabiting Great Bukharia, owing, in all likelihood, to their commerce with the Per&s;ians. The city of Balk, which gives name to this pro|vince, and is its capital, is &s;ituated towards the borders of Per&s;ia, on the river Deha&s;k, which about forty miles from thence falls into the Am&ucirc;, or Oxus. Balk is &s;aid to be one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of all the towns at pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Moham|medan Tartars, being large, fair, and well peo|pled. The khan's ca&s;tle is a great &s;tructure, after the ea&s;tern fa&s;hion, built almo&s;t wholly of marble, dug out of the neighbouring mountains. As fo|reigners have free liberty to trade in this city, it is become the chief mart of all the trade carried on between Great Bukharia and the Indies. To this the fine river, before mentioned, which pa&s;&s;es thro' its &s;uburbs, contributes not a little.</P>

<HEAD>LITTLE BUKHARIA.</HEAD>
<P>The name of Little Bukharia is given to this coun|try, not becau&s;e it is le&s;s in dimen&s;ion than Great Bukharia, being in reality much larger; but be|cau&s;e it is inferior to it as to the goodne&s;s of the &s;oil, number of cities and inhabitants, &amp;c. It is bounded on the we&s;t by Great Bukharia; on the north by the country of the Eluths, or Kalmuks; on the ea&s;t by that of the Mungls, &s;ubject to China; and by Thibet and the north - we&s;t end of China on the &s;outh; from both which countries it is &s;eparated by two kobis or de&s;erts, of va&s;t extent, which communicate with each other. It is &s;ituated between the 92d and 118th degrees of longitude, and between 35&deg;. 30&prime;. and 45&deg;. of latitude; being in length, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, about eight hundred and fifty miles; and in breadth, from &s;outh to north, five hundred and
<PB N="43" REF="430">
eighty; but if its dimen&s;ions be taken according to its &s;emicircular cour&s;e, from the &s;outh to the north-ea&s;t, its length will be twelve hundred miles, but its breadth never above an hundred and forty.</P>
<P>Little Bukharia con&s;i&s;ts of one long chain of mountains, with its branches, extending through the Kobi or Sandy-De&s;ert, which, towards the foot of tho&s;e hills, is inter&s;per&s;ed with fruitful plains; &s;o that it may be compared to a long reef of rocks and i&s;lands ri&s;ing in the &s;ea. The air is healthful, tho' very hot in &s;ummer, and cold in winter. The moun|tains are rich in mines of gold and &s;ilver, but the inhabitants reap little benefit from them, becau&s;e neither the Eluths or Kalmuks, who are ma&s;ters of the country, nor the Bukhars, care to work in them: however, they gather abundance of gold every &s;pring, out of the gutters made by the tor|rents which fall from all &s;ides of tho&s;e mountains, when the &s;now melts; and from hence comes all that gold-du&s;t which the Bukhars carry into India, China, and Siberia. Much mu&s;k is likewi&s;e found in this country, and all &s;orts of precious &s;tones; but the inhabitants have not the art of either cut|ting or poli&s;hing them.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this country, tho' under the do|minion of the Eluths or Kalmuks, are for the general Bukhars, who, it is &s;aid, do not want politene&s;s, and are addicted to commerce, which they carry on with the Indies, China, Per&s;ia, and Ru&s;&s;ia. Both &s;exes carry about them prayers, written by their prie&s;ts, and kept in &s;mall leather pur&s;es, in the nature of re|licks. The Bukhars hou&s;es are of &s;tone, and pret|ty good; but their moveables are few, and not ve|ry hand&s;ome. They always go to bed naked, but dre&s;s when they ri&s;e. They are very neat about their victuals, which are dre&s;&s;ed by &s;laves, whom they either take or buy from the Kalmuks, Ru&s;|&s;ians,
<PB N="44" REF="440">
and other neighbours. They u&s;e neither chairs nor tables, knives nor forks, but &s;it cro&s;s|legged on the ground; and the meat being &s;erved up, ready cut, they pull it to pieces with their fin|gers. Their &s;poons re&s;emble on wooden ladles. The Bukhars buy their wives paying for them more or le&s;s, according to their hand&s;omene&s;s; &s;o that the &s;ure&s;t way to be rich is to have many daughters. The women are reckoned impure forty days after their delivery, and dare not &s;ay their prayers all that time. The child is named the third day after it is born, by the father, or &s;ome re|lation; and circumci&s;ed at the age of &s;even, eight, or nine. Although polygamy is looked on as a &s;ort of &s;in by the Bukhars, yet it is never puni&s;hed; &s;o that &s;ome have ten wives, or more. Any man may, at plea&s;ure, &s;end back his wife; but then &s;he is intitled to whatever he gave her during the co|habitation. The woman al&s;o may part from her hu&s;band; but then &s;he cannot carry away the lea&s;t thing that belongs to her.</P>
<P>The Bukhars have no money, but copper ko|peiks, which weigh near one third of an ounce. When they have &s;ilver or gold to receive or pay, they weigh it, as the Chine&s;e and other nations do.</P>
<P>Although the prevailing religion in Little Buk|haria is the Mohammedan, yet all others enjoy a perfect toleration; becau&s;e the Kalmuks or Eluths, who are ma&s;ters of this country, (though gro&s;s ido|laters) think they ought not, in con&s;cience, to &s;uffer people to be mole&s;ted on account of their belief.</P>
<P>The Bukhars hold Chri&s;t to be a prophet, but have no notion of his &s;ufferings. They &s;ay, that God fir&s;t communicated the Koran to men, by Mo|&s;es and the prophets; and that Mohammed after|wards explained it, and drew a moral from it, which they are obliged to receive and practi&s;e.
<PB N="45" REF="450">
They believe in the re&s;urrection, and a future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments, but cannot be per&s;uaded that any mortal &s;hall be eternally damned; on the contrary, they believe, that as the daemons led them into &s;in, the puni&s;hment will fall chiefly on them. After the re&s;urrection, they think that all men, ex|cept the elect, will be purified or cha&s;ti&s;ed by fire; and that, at la&s;t, every thing but God will be anni|hilated, not excepting devils, angels, and prophets, and a new world created, in the room of the pre|&s;ent. They keep a yearly fa&s;t, which com|mences about the middle of July, and la&s;ts to the middle of Augu&s;t.</P>
<P>Little Bukharia is divided into &s;everal provinces, and contains &s;ome towns. The capital, called Yerkeen or Yerkehen, is &s;aid to be large and pretty well built, in the ea&s;tern way. There is a ca&s;tle in it, where the khan of the Kalmuks comes to re&s;ide &s;ometimes. The city mu&s;t needs be very populous and rich, as it is the centre of all commerce carried on between the Indies and north of A&s;ia, Thibet, Siberia, Great Bukharia, and China. Peter the Fir&s;t, emperor of Ru&s;&s;ia, intended to have &s;ettled a regular trade with Yar|keen, by the river Irti&s;h, which would have proved very advantageous to his dominions.</P>

<P>THE va&s;t, antient, and opulent empire of China, &s;ituated on the mo&s;t ea&s;tern verge of the A&s;iatic continent, is bounded on the north by Ea&s;t and We&s;t Tartary, from which it is divided by a prodigious wall, of fifteen hundred miles in length, and partly by high, craggy, and inacce&s;&s;ible mountains; on the ea&s;t by the Ea&s;tern Ocean; on the we&s;t by part of the Mogul's empire, and India beyond the Ganges, from which it is part|ed by other ridges of high mountains, and &s;andy de|&s;erts; and on the &s;outh partly by the kingdoms of Lao, Tonquin, Ava, and Cochin-China, and part|ly by the Southern Ocean, or Indian Sea, which flows between it and the Philippine I&s;lands.

<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>As China extends &s;o far from &s;outh to north, as from the &s;econd to the fifth climate, its tempera|ture mu&s;t vary accordingly. The difference of the length of its days is little more than four hours; the longe&s;t, in the mo&s;t northern parts, being about fourteen hours and three quarters, and the &s;horte&s;t, in the mo&s;t &s;outhern, about ten hours and three quarters; and the nights proportionable. The country is for the mo&s;t part temperate, except to|wards the north, where the cold is extremely pierc|ing; not &s;o much from its &s;ituation, as from the ridges of mountains, which are very high, and com|monly covered with deep &s;nows. The &s;outhern parts, about the tropic, are exceeding hot and dry. All the winter they have there is about the equi|noxes, e&s;pecially the autumnal, when they are much troubled with &s;torms, and violent rains. The mid|dle of China is crowned, almo&s;t the whole year, with a mo&s;t &s;erene &s;ky, and mo&s;t delightful ver|dure. The &s;oil is different, according to the diver|&s;ity of climates; and the face of the country in &s;ome parts mountainous, in others champaign; but the inhabitants are &s;uch expert and diligent ma&s;ters of agriculture, that they leave no &s;pot uncul|tivated. As they abound with artificial canals and re|&s;ervoirs, for watering and fertilizing their low lands, &s;o they al&s;o find ways and means to improve their higher grounds, fir&s;t, by levelling a great many of them, where it was found practicable, and likely to turn to account; &s;econdly, by levelling and
<PB N="48" REF="480">
flatting the tops of others, in order to make them bear variety of grain, pul&s;e, and the like; thirdly, by dividing their declivities into as many flat &s;tages as po&s;&s;ible, and, if they meet with a &s;pring towards the top, &s;upplying them from thence with water. Other methods by which they improve their lands are, by rai&s;ing artificial mounts, in &s;ome places; by providing proper fences again&s;t exce&s;&s;ive colds, heats, or droughts, in others; and, by varying their agriculture, their manuring, planting, and &s;owing, according to the different &s;oils and cli|mates; in&s;omuch, that every &s;pot almo&s;t of that va&s;t country produces more than enough to make its inhabitants rich and happy, and the whole country, delightful, populous, and healthy. No|thing can be more agreeable than to view, from the lower grounds and vallies, the &s;ides of the moun|tains, cut into a number of terraces, one over the other, and all covered, up to the very top, with variety of corn and fruits. The&s;e mountains, in general, are nothing near &s;o hard and &s;toney as ours, but rather of a &s;oft porous nature, and, what is &s;till more &s;urpri&s;ing, may be dug, with ea&s;e, &s;ome hun|dreds of feet deep; &s;o that the &s;alts which tran&s;pire through their pores prove a con&s;tant and excellent manure to them: but where the mountains are rocky, they content them&s;elves with planting them with all &s;orts of fruit, according to the nature of the ground. In &s;ome provinces they have two, and &s;ometimes three, plentiful harve&s;ts in a year. The variery of climates, the fertility of the &s;oil, the &s;kill and indu&s;try of the people, are &s;uch in China, that almo&s;t all the fruits and produce that are found either in hot or cold countries, are to be met with in it: in particular, it produces corn and grain of all &s;orts, in great plenty, with &s;ilk, cotton, honey, wax, and fruits, of all the &s;orts we have in Europe, and &s;everal others not known among us, all exqui|&s;ite

to the &s;ight and ta&s;te. Their oranges, grapes, figs, pomegranates, ananas, and many others, are in as great perfection as in any part of India. Their rich pa&s;ture-grounds feed va&s;t numbers of cattle. Be&s;ides a great plenty and variety of game, buffaloes, hor&s;es, oxen, &s;wine, and &s;everal &s;orts of deer, who&s;e &s;kins are a profitable commo|dity, here are al&s;o elephants, camels, leopards, boars, bears, and other wild creatures, not to be found in other countries. The tygers are very fierce, and extremely dangerous, &s;eeking their prey commonly in large droves: the mu&s;k|cat, which carries that noble perfume in a kind of bladder under its navel, is found here, and much valued: their mules, which are wild, are fitter for eating than for other u&s;es. Their birds are eagles, cranes, &s;torks, birds of Paradi&s;e, pelicans, peacocks, phea&s;ants, gee&s;e, &s;wans, and a great variety of others. As for fi&s;h, it cannot be doubted but that the mul|titude of rivers, canals, and lakes, as well as the &s;ea, that runs along the &s;outh-ea&s;t coa&s;t of the country, mu&s;t &s;upply them with the greate&s;t plen|ty and variety. We are told in An&s;on's Voyage, that the Centurion fell in with a fleet of fi&s;hermen off the coa&s;t of China, con&s;i&s;ting of upwards of a thou&s;and &s;ail, under the command of an admiral. Be&s;ides, mo&s;t of the great and rich people have large canals and ponds, &s;tored with fi&s;h for their own u&s;e; among which, but purely for ornament, are generally found tho&s;e mo&s;t beautiful &s;pecies called, from their colour, gold and &s;ilver fi&s;h, and which are now common enough in England. This curious &s;pecies of fi&s;h is about the length of one's finger, and thick in proportion. The male is of a delicate red, from the head to the middle, and from thence to the tail of a bright colour, which by far exceeds the fine&s;t gilding. The female is white, and has a tail like a no&s;egay, which, with part of its body, &s;hines like poli&s;hed &s;ilver. They gene|rally

&s;wim near the &s;urface of the water, and give a mo&s;t exqui&s;ite re&s;plendency and variety to it; and they multiply &s;o fa&s;t, that if care be not taken of their eggs, which float upon the wa|ter, the whole &s;urface will be covered with them. The&s;e eggs are exceedingly tender, and ea&s;ily killed by heat or cold, &s;trong &s;mells, thunder, or the re|port of a cannon. The way to pre&s;erve them is to take them gently out of the water, and put them in &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, well &s;heltered from wind, rain, and cold, until they are hatched by the &s;un, and grown to about an inch in length: with &s;afety, they may be removed into their primitive re&s;er|voirs, where they are ju&s;tly admired as a great natural curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>The Chine&s;e have plenty of &s;ugar, tobacco, and oil, extracted not from olives, but from &s;eeds; notwith&s;tanding, there are va&s;t quantities of olives, of a fine ta&s;te, though of a different kind from ours, but they are either unfit to produce, or not thought worth the extracting oil from; and a variety of excellent wines, (&s;ome from grapes, &s;ome from rice, and &s;ome from quinces, and other fruits) palm, and other trees. Camphire, ebony, &s;anders wood, oak, pine, and other lofty trees, are found in great abundance, e&s;pecially on tho&s;e mountains which are not otherwi&s;e cultivated. The tallow-tree, which &s;eems to be peculiar to China, bears a fruit who&s;e kernel has all the quali|ties of tallow, in &s;mell, colour, and con&s;i&s;tency, and they make candles of it. The low country a|bounds with variety of canes, junks, and bamboes, of exqui&s;ite beauty, together with va&s;t quantities of medicinal roots, &s;uch as China-root, rhubarb, jin|&s;eng, and many more; and, among a va&s;t variety of &s;hrubs, that &s;o much e&s;teemed of late in Eu|rope, called tea. All teas are the leaf of one and the &s;ame &s;hrub: the &s;uppo&s;ition that green is from one kind of tree, and bohea from another, is a vul|gar
<PB N="51" REF="510">
error; for they differ only as malt may do, in being more or le&s;s dried, or being finer or coar&s;er. The tea-&s;hrub is of the kind of our dog-tree, and its leaf of an au&s;tere, bitter, a&s;tringent ta&s;te, without any aromatic warmth. It has very little oil in it, and that which it has is of the re&s;inous kind, and of a narcotic, &s;tupifying quality. It has al&s;o but very little &s;alt, and that is of the fixed kind. Be&s;ides the general divi&s;ion of teas into two &s;orts, green and bohea, they are likewi&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed and denominated according to the provinces or di|&s;tricts where they grow, the degree of ripene&s;s when gathered, the &s;ize of the leaf, or the method of curing; as hy&s;on, imperial, bloom, congo, &s;inglo, &s;ouchong, &amp;c. The leaves, when immediately pulled from the &s;hrub, are &s;o extremely bitter, that the infu&s;ion of them is very di&s;agreeable to the ta&s;te; therefore tho&s;e who are appointed in China to prepare them for u&s;e, infu&s;e them for a certain time in water, &s;oon after they are gathered, by which a portion of their bitter re&s;inous particles being taken away, they become mild, plea&s;ant, and pa|latable. After being infu&s;ed, they are dried in the following manner: the bohea, which is made from the leaves when full ripe, and ready to fall from the tree, being thus brought to a proper flavour by infu&s;ion, is immediately dried by the &s;un or fire, &s;o that it may be pre&s;erved for u&s;e; therefore, as the tree or &s;hrub incurs no detriment from the leaves being pulled off, when ready to fall off them&s;elves, this tea can be afforded at a cheaper rate than the green; and this will al&s;o account for the leaves of the bohea being darker in colour, and &s;maller in breadth; becau&s;e, being almo&s;t dry when gathered, then &s;teeped in water, and higher dried, they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be more contracted and corru|gated than tho&s;e of the green. This, on the con|trary, being pulled from the &s;ame &s;hrub, with more
<PB N="52" REF="520">
violence ju&s;t as the leaf is expanded to full maturity, the tree &s;uffers &s;o much, that two or three years are allowed it to recover its pri&s;tine vigour; and the leaves, during that time, are collected when they fall, and prepared for bohea; on which account the green is &s;old at a higher price than bohea, and the bloom tea dearer than either. Green tea al&s;o becomes dearer by a more expen&s;ive preparation; for, as &s;oon as it is brought to a proper flavour, by the previous infu&s;ion in water, it is immediately expo&s;ed to the warm rays of the &s;un, and carefully and a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly turned, for a con&s;iderable time; after which, it is &s;trewed upon broad &s;heets of copper, laid upon embers, where it is rolled and turned by the hands of proper per&s;ons, who are armed with gloves of leather, to protect them from the mi&s;chief to which, they have found by experi|ence, they are in this bu&s;ine&s;s expo&s;ed, by the me|tallic efflore&s;cence from which the green tea derives its more agreeable colour, and, according to the ge|neral but fal&s;e notion, its &s;uperior excellency over the bohea; in regard to which, the delu&s;ion or in|fatuation that engages them to make the con&s;idera|tion of health &s;ub&s;ervient to the gratification of the palate, and the delights of the eye, prevails equally among A&s;iatics and Europeans: hence, the ver|dant beauty of this artificial colour is more alluring, and more e&s;teemed, though often pernicious, than the brown hue of the bohea, which is prepared in a more &s;imple, and con&s;equently le&s;s dangerous, manner. The Chine&s;e them&s;elves, however, very rarely drink the green tea; and it is ob&s;erved, that tho&s;e who do, to any exce&s;s, become tabid, and die quite emaciated. In &s;hort, the drinking of tea, in ge|neral, may be reckoned a great cau&s;e of the manife&s;t effeminacy, and diminutivene&s;s of their per&s;ons; for what rea&s;on can we a&s;&s;ign &s;o probable for the obvious con&s;titutional difference between them and the more

robu&s;t people, who live under the &s;ame latitude If we al&s;o compare the nature of tea with the na|ture of the Engli&s;h diet, and that of mo&s;t other European nations, no one can think it a proper ve|getable for us. Indeed, the nervous complaints, &s;o frequent of late years, e&s;pecially among the weaker &s;ex, may in a great mea&s;ure be attributed to the u&s;e of this exotic beverage. But to do ju&s;tice to the Chine&s;e, we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that it is alledged, in vindication of their tea-drinking, that they had found by experiment, that nothing el&s;e could cor|rect &s;o well their waters, which are almo&s;t every where bracki&s;h. The tea-plant degenerates if tran&s;planted into another country, though it lie under the &s;ame parallel.</P>
<P>In China Proper there are few high mountains; but in Chine&s;ian or Ea&s;t-Tartary, north of the great wall, there are many, as we have already remarked.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t con&s;iderable rivers are the Ky-am or Blue River, which ri&s;es in the kingdom of Thibet, and cro&s;&s;es the country from ea&s;t to we&s;t; the Hoambo or Yellow River, &s;o called, becau&s;e, after rains e&s;pecially, it is of that colour, and extremely muddy. It ri&s;es in the mountains which divide the province of Su-chan from Tartary, near the fron|tiers of Indo&s;tan, and runs a cour&s;e of above one thou&s;and nine hundred miles. There are many other rivers of the &s;ame nature, alike rapid and muddy, &s;ome of which have cataracts of a va&s;t height, making a noi&s;e like continued claps of thunder. There is one always as red as blood; and another that glit|ters by night, occa&s;ioned by the great quantity of precious &s;tones contained in it, whence it is &s;tiled the Pearl River. There is a third, near Fomin, which turns blue in harve&s;t, at which time the in|habitants are u&s;ed to dye that colour. We are told of another, near Pan-gau, who&s;e waters are &s;o light that they will bear no timber. Tho&s;e of another,
<PB N="54" REF="540">
near Ching-tien, are &s;aid to be &s;weet-&s;cented; and that called Kin-xa has its name from the great quanty of gold &s;and in it. There is one in the province of Fokien who&s;e water is green, and is affirmed to turn iron into copper; but that wants confirmation. That called Xo is &s;aid to cure di|vers di&s;ea&s;es. But the mo&s;t remarkable is one which ri&s;es yearly upon a certain day, with &s;uch a high tide, before the city of Hang-chen, that mul|titudes of people croud from all parts to &s;ee &s;o &s;ur|prizing a phaenomenon, which neither their own nor European philo&s;ophers, it is &s;aid, have yet been able to account for. The&s;e waters &s;upply the people of the inland parts with falt, which is procured by paring off the &s;urface of the muddy &s;hores, which being dried in the &s;un, rubbed &s;mall, and thrown into a pit, &s;alt water is poured upon it, and that be|ing afterwards &s;trained, is boiled to a proper con|&s;i&s;tence; but, in the maritime parts, they make &s;alt of &s;ea-water, after the u&s;ual way. As to the arti|ficial rivers or canals, they are innumerable; &s;ome of them a thou&s;and miles in length, and deep e|nough to carry ve&s;&s;els of a very great burden. The chief of them are lined with hewn &s;tone on the &s;ides, and when the wind does not &s;erve, the boats are drawn by the &s;trength of men. There are abun|dance of &s;amilies that live all their lives upon the water; and &s;ome relate, that there are almo&s;t as many people upon the water as upon the land.</P>
<P>The mountains of China abound with variety of metals and minerals: among the former they have &s;everal mines of gold and &s;ilver; but their mo|narchs, they pretend, will not &s;uffer the mines of &s;ilver to be wrought, that the people may not be obliged to &s;uch &s;lavi&s;h work; but it is more probable they either keep them in ca&s;e of need, or rather, perhaps, to keep down the price of labour, which mu&s;t ri&s;e in proportion to the quantity of
<PB N="55" REF="550">
circulating money. Their workmen, in general, have not above five farthings &s;terling a day; and hence ari&s;es the cheapne&s;s, and immen&s;e exporta|tion, of their manufactures and produce.</P>
<P>As to the mines of gold, it &s;eems nothing more is done than gathering &s;uch particles as are wa&s;hed down by the rivers, and are found &s;tick|ing on the banks, or caught by fleeces and other &s;trainers, laid acro&s;s the water. Great mul|titudes of people live wholly by this bu&s;ine&s;s; va&s;t quantities of that metal being, as it is &s;aid, wa&s;hed down from the mountains, and found in the &s;ands of the brooks and rivers. Their mountains con|tain al&s;o mines of iron, copper, lead, and quick&s;il|ver, which are manufactured in great quantities, and very hand&s;omely. Be&s;ides the&s;e, they have others which are mixed in a peculiar manner, and therefore kept as a great &s;ecret among them; &s;uch, for in&s;tance, is that famed one called tonbaga, or donbaga, which is of the colour of very pale bra&s;s, or a dull kind of tin: they a&s;cribe &s;everal extra|ordinary virtues to it; particularly, of expelling poi&s;on, &s;topping hemorrhages, and the like, by on|ly wearing a ring or necklace made of it. Among other articles produced in their mountains, we may reckon likewi&s;e plenty of pit-coal, &s;alts of different &s;orts, excellent quarries of &s;tone, and &s;ome of mar|ble, &s;o curiou&s;ly variegated with land&s;capes, and other natural re&s;emblances, that they look as if drawn with a pencil. Several other &s;orts are e&s;teem|ed for their fine colour and hardne&s;s; others, for a lu&s;tre or brilliancy like that of marble; and &s;ome, when burnt, yield a metal, of which they make &s;words, and other weapons. We are told of other &s;tones of a precious kind, &s;haped like a &s;wallow, and others of great efficacy in divers di&s;ea&s;es. In &s;ome provinces is found a yellow earth, which has the
<PB N="56" REF="560">
virtue of expelling poi&s;on, and curing, by external application, the bite of venomous creatures. Some &s;orts of earth they have of a fine vermillion co|lour, and others of a delicate white, which the la|dies u&s;e for paints. In &s;everal places of the empire, they pre&s;s a &s;ort of gum or juice from the bark of a tree, which is tough like pitch, and, when mixed with proper colours, &s;erves to paint their hou&s;es, cabinets, and other uten&s;ils, having a fine lu&s;tre and &s;moothne&s;s, like gla&s;s. This juice they call giran; but it is more commonly known among Europeans by the name of lacquer, and what is done in that manner, Japan-work, becau&s;e what comes from thence far exceeds any thing done in China, in lu&s;tre, hardne&s;s, and fine variety of paintings. The Chine&s;e are &s;o jealous le&s;t the &s;ecret of this work &s;hould be di&s;covered by foreigners, that they have poi&s;oned &s;everal, and even &s;ome of our own nation, whom they &s;u&s;pected of having pried too narrowly into it. Be&s;ides the common bees-wax, they have another &s;ort, the cleare&s;t and white&s;t in the world, which is produced by an in&s;ect no bigger than a flea, on the top of the branches of &s;ome particular trees, where the&s;e little creatures lay their eggs, which in the &s;pring turn to worms. The owners of the&s;e trees gather this wax and make it into cakes, which are quite tran&s;pa|rent. The inhabitants of Xantum put the&s;e worms into large canes, and, by &s;elling them to the ad|jacent provinces, make a con&s;iderable profit of them.</P>

<HEAD>TRADE, MANUFACTURES, and NAVIGATION.</HEAD>
<P>The Chine&s;e, from the remote&s;t antiquity, ex|ported the growth and commodities of their coun|try, e&s;pecially raw &s;ilks, wherein it abounds, all over the ea&s;t. It was from them, that they were called, by
<PB N="57" REF="570">
the Greeks and Romans, Seres. Under the reigns of &s;ome former emperors, China was, as Japan now is, &s;hut up, and kept from all commerce with fo|reign nations, and the inhabitants &s;trictly forbid, under &s;evere penalties, to export the growth of the country, or to have any communication with their neighbours. Things &s;tood thus, when the Tarta|rian conqueror, thinking it would very much conduce to the honour of his &s;ubjects, and the ad|vantage of his dominions, to allow, for the future, a free and undi&s;turbed commerce, re&s;olved to &s;uffer his &s;ubjects to trade abroad, and to give foreigners free acce&s;s to his dominions. The chief manufac|tures of the Chine&s;e are tho&s;e of &s;ilk, cotton, tea, china-ware, and cabinets or lacquered-ware. Their &s;ilks are inexpre&s;&s;ibly fine, their atlas's, gold and &s;ilver &s;tuffs, are not to be paralleled; but their porcelain is thought to be equalled by that of Dre&s;den, and their lacquered-ware is excelled by that of Japan. In hardware the Europeans excel them infinitely; at making clocks and watches, door and gun locks, and in many other arts and handicrafts, they are mere bunglers. Their paper is not comparable to ours; but their ink is good, as we experience here, it being brought over in lit|tle oblong cakes, though not, as far as we know, u&s;ed in writing. The Chine&s;e had no traffic, except with the neighbouring nations, until the Portugue&s;e di&s;covered the way thither by the Cape of Good Hope, tho' it is &s;aid, they had the load-&s;tone and mariner's compa&s;s, long before us. Their junks, as they are called, are many of them a thou&s;and tons burthen, heavy &s;ailors, with &s;quare heads and &s;terns. Some of them have two ma&s;ts, others three, but never any top-ma&s;ts, and their &s;ails are made of matting, which they let down upon the deck, when they furl them. The hold of the &s;hip is divided in|to many &s;mall partitions, which are made &s;o tight,
<PB N="58" REF="580">
that if a leak happens in one of them it goes no further, and the goods &s;towed in the other parti|tions receive no damage. Upon their numerous canals they have ve&s;&s;els almo&s;t as big as &s;hips, worked by a few hands, with great dexterity. There are not le&s;s than ten thou&s;and of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els in the &s;outhern provinces, appropriated to the &s;er|vice of the government. Upon their decks they build little rooms, from one end to the other, rai&s;ed about eight feet high, painted and gild|ed, extremely neat and commodious, in which their mandarins and great officers travel toge|ther, and no where &s;pend their time more agree|ably; for here they vi&s;it one another without ce|remony, and pa&s;s away their time, as if they were all of a family, which freedoms are never taken by magi&s;trates on &s;hore. There is &s;carce a city or village in the whole empire, e&s;pecially in the &s;outhern provinces, but enjoys the benefit of &s;ome navigable river, lake, canal, or arm of the &s;ea; and wherever there is a town on &s;hore, there is another of boats upon the water; and many people are born, live, and die, upon the water, keeping hogs, poultry, dogs, and other dome&s;tic animals, on board. Be&s;ides the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, there is a prodigious number of floats of timber perpetually going up and down the rivers and canals, which carry whole villages of people upon them, the&s;e floats being &s;ome of them a mile in length, upon which they build little huts, and live in them, until they have di&s;po&s;ed of their timber, which they carry &s;ometimes a thou&s;and miles by water; and thus every part of this exten&s;ive em|pire has an ea&s;y communication with the other, which is a va&s;t advantage to trade, as the Chine&s;e, Dutch, and &s;everal other trading nations, expe|rience.</P>

<HEAD>PERSONS, HABITS, CUSTOMS, CHARACTER, GENIUS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>The Chine&s;e are generally of a middling &s;tature, broad faced, with black hair, &s;mall black eyes, &s;hort no&s;es, and thin beards, pulling up great part of their beard by the roots with tweezers. They were very fond of the hair of their heads, which they u&s;ed to wear tied up in a great bundle on their crowns, till their Tartar princes compelled them to cut off their hair, and leave only a &s;ingle lock upon their crown, as the Mohammedans in all countries do. Their complexions incline to tawny near the tropic; but, in the north, they are as fair as other people under the &s;ame parallel. The women are remarkable for their little feet, being e&s;teemed their greate&s;t beauty; and, in order to keep them little, they are bound up from their infancy &s;o tight, that they cannot grow to the common &s;ize, the foot of a full-grown woman not being bigger than a child's of four years old. The men wear a cap of the &s;hape of a bell upon their heads, which does not cover their ears: they al&s;o wear a ve&s;t and &s;a&s;h, and over the ve&s;t a loo&s;e coat or gown, and a kind of &s;ilk boots, quilted with cotton. When they are at home, among their friends, they throw off every thing but a pair of drawers, and appear naked, as the common people do about the &s;treets; but this mu&s;t be under&s;tood of the &s;outhern provinces. The women dre&s;s with their hair down, having nothing on their heads, in the &s;outh. They generally wear a &s;ilk ve&s;t, red, blue, or green, and over it a loo&s;e gown with white &s;leeves, and em|broidered &s;ilk &s;hoes; but, by rea&s;on of the &s;mallne&s;s of their feet, hobble prodigiou&s;ly when they walk. Here, as in mo&s;t other countries of the Ea&s;t, the married couple are commonly brought together
<PB N="60" REF="600">
without any previous acquaintance with each other; the bargain being &s;truck by their parents, or by &s;ome go-between, and afterwards ratified, by pre|&s;ents &s;ent by both &s;ides. Great pomp is u&s;ed in the marriage-ceremony. The bride brings no dowry; but is rather purcha&s;ed by her &s;pou&s;e, who be&s;ides the price he pays for her, commonly ex|pends a great deal on the nuptial fea&s;t, and a very &s;plendid and co&s;tly cavalcade in bringing her home. This is the con&s;tant cu&s;tom of the rich; but the poorer &s;ort, who cannot afford to pay money for a wife, go to &s;ome of their foundling ho&s;pitals, and beg for one, which is &s;eldom denied, and this both &s;aves charges, and makes the wife more &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to her hu&s;band. The Chine&s;e laws allow but one wife to a man; but they are permitted to have &s;e|veral concubines, who are brought into his hou&s;e, without any other ceremony than a promi&s;&s;ory note of the &s;um agreed on, and of u&s;ing her well; but the lawful wife is generally mi&s;tre&s;s over them, as well as over all the &s;ervants of the hou&s;e; and the children of the concubines are deemed to belong to her, and to have an equal right to inherit. In re|gard to the behaviour of the Chine&s;e towards the dead, there is &s;carce any country where grief is manife&s;ted to &s;uch a degree, e&s;pecially for a near relation; or where mourning is &s;o deep, and conti|nued &s;o long. Every Chine&s;e keeps in his hou&s;e a table, whereon are written the names of his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, before which they frequently burn incen&s;e, and pro&s;trate them|&s;elves; and when the father of a family dies, the great-grandfather is taken away, and the decea&s;ed added to make up the number. No per&s;ons are ever buried within the walls of a town or city; nor is a dead corp&s;e ever &s;uffered to be brought into them, if the per&s;on dies in the country. Moun|tains and &s;olitary places are generally cho&s;en by the
<PB N="61" REF="610">
great men to build their &s;epulchres in; and &s;ome are &s;aid to be little inferior to palaces. If the &s;e|pulchre is erected in a plain, they rai&s;e a va&s;t heap of earth over it, which they carry almo&s;t to the height of a mountain. The Chinele are exceeding fond of &s;hews: an in&s;tance of which we &s;hall here give in a fe&s;tival, not many years &s;ince, celebrated in their country. It has been an antient cu&s;tom among them to celebrate the &s;ixtieth year of the emperor's mother, with mo&s;t amazing pomp. The la&s;t three months of the year 1751 were taken up in making preparations for the approaching grand fe&s;tival. All the painters, &s;culptors, architects, mu&s;icians, and carpenters of Pekin and the neigh|bouring provinces, were employed, each in exe|cuting &s;ome ma&s;ter-piece of his re&s;pective art. The main object was to charm the eyes and ears of the mo&s;t delicate and voluptuous court in the uni|ver&s;e. The whole di&s;tance from one of the empe|ror's hou&s;es of plea&s;ure, to his palace in the centre of the Tartar city in Peking, being about twelve Engli&s;h miles, was to be decorated in the mo&s;t &s;u|perb manner; and as the proce&s;&s;ion would be, in great part, along the river, it was fore&s;een that the barks con&s;tructed to carry the emperor, the em|pre&s;s-mother, and the whole court, were likely to be of very little u&s;e, on account of the ice, the time of the ceremony falling out in the mo&s;t rigorous &s;ea&s;on of the year: however, &s;ome of the mandarins un|dertook to remove the&s;e ob&s;tacles by employing, night and day, for more than three weeks together, &s;ome thou&s;ands of men, in continually beating the &s;urface of the water to prevent its freezing, and the like number in breaking the ice already formed; but, in &s;pite of all their efforts, the cold prevailed, and the whole river was &s;et fa&s;t, and the project abandoned. The principal director of this fruitle&s;s enterprize was mulcted two years &s;alary,
<PB N="62" REF="620">
and obliged to furni&s;h &s;ledges in&s;tead of the barks. Both &s;ides of the river were covered with edifices of divers forms, which gave a &s;triking plea&s;ure to the beholders. On &s;uch parts of the river as were wider than the re&s;t wooden hou&s;es were erected upon piles, and di&s;po&s;ed in groups, to which bridges conducted; the whole gilded, painted, and mo&s;t &s;uperbly ornamented. In &s;ome were bands of mu&s;ic; in others companies of comedians; and in others magnificent thrones, with all &s;orts of refre&s;h|ments for the emperor and his mother, if they &s;hould be plea&s;ed to &s;top there. In the city, from the gate of entry quite on to the palace, were grand buildings, peri&s;tyles, pavilions, colonades, galleries, and amphitheatres, with numberle&s;s rich trophies. Factitious jewels &s;parkled in all parts, and the gaudy objects were reflected and multiplied by an infinite number of little mirrours of poli&s;hed metal. The&s;e glittering edifices were inter&s;per&s;ed with artificial mountains and vallies, cattle, trees, and fountains; in other places, with gardens &s;tocked with fruits and flowers of every &s;ea&s;on of the year, which, though artificial, could hardly be di&s;tingui&s;hed from natural, &s;o exqui&s;ite was the illu&s;ion. In &s;ome places rocks aro&s;e, and children, clothed in &s;kins, played the part of monkies, and other ani|mals, &s;kipping from cliff to cliff. Some weeks before the ceremony, the &s;treets were divided into three parts, of which the middle was de&s;tined for tho&s;e who rode on hor&s;eback, or in carriages; one of the &s;ides for per&s;ons going out, and the other for tho&s;e that were returning. A number of &s;ol|diers, armed only with &s;taves, prevented all di&s;|order and confu&s;ion; and as women never mingle with men in the &s;treets, the emperor appointed certain days for them alone. The pre&s;ents made on this occa&s;ion were an&s;werable to the magnifi|cence of the &s;pectacle. The Europeans di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
<PB N="63" REF="630">
them&s;elves by a mo&s;t ingeniou&s;ly contrived piece of machinery, with which the emperor was &s;o highly delighted, that he cau&s;ed it to be depo&s;ited in his palace, and frequently amu&s;ed him&s;elf in vi&s;it|ing it. The expence of this pompous entertain|ment exceeded three hundred millions of rupees, and it was graced with the pre&s;ence of the two im|perial per&s;onages on the &s;ixth of January, 1752.</P>
<P>The Chine&s;e are undoubtedly a very ingenious and indu&s;trious people, as appears by all their fine manufactures daily brought to Europe; &s;uch as their wrought &s;ilks, cabinets, and other japanery, and their curious porcelain. The admirable culti|vation of their lands, their canals great and &s;mall, and various magnificent &s;tructures, are further te&s;|timonies of their genius and indu&s;try: to which we may add, what &s;eems now generally agreed on all hands, that they have had the u&s;e of the mariners compa&s;s, of gunpowder, and the art of printing for many centuries; in&s;omuch, that &s;ome are of opinion, that they were all three brought from thence to Europe, either by Paul the Venetian, or &s;ome other channel. And, indeed, with re&s;pect to the la&s;t, whoever con&s;iders that the e&s;&s;ay of Fau&s;tus, who invented, or rather improved that art, was upon wooden blocks, in the &s;ame manner as has been done in China from time immemorial, will be apt to own, that theirs gave the fir&s;t notion to Europeans, though they have &s;ince been &s;o infinite|ly &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by them. They are likewi&s;e ma&s;ters of &s;everal arts and &s;ciences, though not to the per|fection we are; yet they are very vain of their learning, ingenuity, and &s;agacity, and think them|&s;elves &s;uperior to all others. To this we may add, that they are of a mo&s;t in&s;inuating addre&s;s, and will not decline the mo&s;t hazardous enterprizes, where there is a pro&s;pect of gain. The men of figure are perpetually engaged in pur&s;uit of places and prefer|ments,
<PB N="64" REF="640">
which they procure by bribes or pre&s;ents as they are called. Their laws oblige them to cer|tain rules of civility in their words and actions; but they are naturally a fawning, cringing gene|ration, and the greate&s;t hypocrites on the face of the earth. Trade and commerce, or rather cheat|ing and over-reaching, &s;eems to be the natural bent and genius of this people: gain is their God, they prefer it to every thing. A &s;tranger is in great danger of being cheated, if he tru&s;ts to his own judgment; and if he employs a Chine&s;e broker, it is well if he does not join with the merchant to im|po&s;e on the &s;tranger.</P>

<HEAD>RELIGION and LEARNING.</HEAD>
<P>The religion of the Chine&s;e is gro&s;s idolatry, or rather they are &s;aid to wor&s;hip one &s;upreme God, and &s;everal inferior deities, who appear to have been men eminent in their &s;everal ages, particularly the inventors of arts and &s;ciences. They al&s;o wor|&s;hip things inanimate, as mountains, woods, and rivers, but never &s;acrifice to vice, as is cu&s;tomary with other pagans. There are three &s;ects in China at this day: fir&s;t, the followers of La-Laokun, who lived, they &s;ay, above five hundred years before Chri&s;t. He taught that God was corporeal, and had many &s;ubordinate deities under his government. His di&s;ciples &s;tudy magic, and pretend to make that drink which will give immortality. The &s;e|cond is the &s;ect of the learned, or di&s;ciples of the &s;o much celebrated Confucius, who left many ad|mirable precepts of morality, and in&s;tructed the people in philo&s;ophy. He &s;peaks of God as a mo&s;t pure and perfect principle, and the fountain and e&s;&s;ence of all beings. Tho' we are told that he pro|hibited idolatry, he has temples and images erect|ed to him, and is wor&s;hipped with the profounde&s;t
<PB N="65" REF="650">
adoration, as appears from the pope's decree again&s;t the Je&s;uits, for indulging the&s;e converts in this idolatrous wor&s;hip. The third &s;ect, which is that of the idol Fo, or Fohi, the founder of the Chine&s;e nation, is much more numerous than either of the former. They &s;tile him the only Saviour of the world. His prie&s;ts, the bonzes, teach &s;everal moral precepts, and a &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;h|ments after this life. The puni&s;hments con&s;i&s;t chiefly in animating &s;ome vermin, or bea&s;t of burden, after death; whence, and their inculcating the unlawfulne&s;s of killing any living creature, it would &s;eem, that the doctrine of tran&s;migration was an article of their creed. They forbid al&s;o the drinking wine; and do not forget to in&s;truct their followers, how much it is their duty and intere&s;t to entertain and nouri&s;h their prie&s;ts, and to build them temples and mona&s;teries, and perform the penances they enjoin. If they neglect the&s;e things, they threaten them with the greate&s;t torments after death.</P>
<P>The Chine&s;e have al&s;o an image of immortality, which they wor&s;hip under the form of a mon&s;trous fat man &s;itting cro&s;s-legged, with a huge promi|nent belly. There is another, called the idol of plea&s;ure, about twenty feet high; and between the&s;e, in their temples, is another large image, thirty feet high, gilded over, with a crown upon his head, and richly dre&s;&s;ed: this they call the great king Kang, to whom they pay adoration. The emperor being a Tartar, follows the idolatry of his nation, which does not differ much from that of the Chine&s;e, except it be that they wor&s;hip a living man, whom they &s;tile the great lama. They give him the name of eternal father; and many of the Tartar tribes, as appears from our de&s;cription of Great Tartary, have the greate&s;t ve|neration for him. He is &s;hewn in a dark place
<PB N="66" REF="660">
of his palace, illuminated with lamps; and that he may be thought immortal, his prie&s;ts chu&s;e one out of their number as like him as po&s;&s;ible, who &s;ucceeds when he dies. None of his votaries doubt of his living for ever. His urine and ex|crements are held as &s;acred, and are di&s;tributed in pre&s;ents to the Tartar princes, who mix them up, as &s;omething very delicious, in the &s;auces of their food.</P>
<P>The Chri&s;tian religion made a great progre&s;s in China about a hundred years ago. The Je&s;uits relate, they had two hundred churches and chapels there; but falling out with the mi&s;&s;ionaries of other orders, and endeavouring to ruin each other, they were all in general bani&s;hed the empire about forty years ago, and their pro&s;elytes compelled to renounce Chri&s;tianity: and indeed it was an odd &s;ort of Chri&s;tianity, that was profe&s;&s;ed in China, when it flouri&s;hed mo&s;t. The Je&s;uits &s;uffered their pro&s;elytes to continue wor&s;hipping Confucius, and their parents and ance&s;tors, at the &s;ame time that they taught them to wor&s;hip Chri&s;t and the Virgin Mary, with the popi&s;h &s;aints and images. We are told that Chri&s;tianity was fir&s;t planted in China and the Indies, either by the apo&s;tle St. Thomas, or by &s;ome of his di&s;ciples. The Chine&s;e records &s;eem to intimate, that a man came there about that time, who preached a heavenly doc|trine, and confirmed it by miracles. In an antient Chaldiac Breviary of the church of Malabar, the conver&s;ion of the Chine&s;e is attributed to that apo&s;tle. There is al&s;o an antient marble pillar erected in the province of Xen-&s;i, in memory of a man that brought Chri&s;tianity thither in the year 636. However, the mi&s;&s;ionaries of the church of Rome did not find, as we are told, the lea&s;t ve&s;tige of Chri&s;tianity remaining in China when they came there.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="670">
As to the learning of the Chine&s;e, it &s;eems in a great mea&s;ure confined to the &s;tudy of their own language. Their characters are a &s;ort of &s;hort|hand; every character &s;ignifies a word, or &s;en|tence. They have not to this day the u&s;e of letters. There are upwards of twenty thou&s;and of tho&s;e characters, and their mo&s;t learned men are &s;carce ma&s;ters of all of them. Tho&s;e in common u&s;e do not exceed three thou&s;and, which are under&s;tood in every part of the empire. They write from the top to the bottom of the page. This va&s;t number of Chine&s;e characters is reducible, after all, to a pure and &s;imple alphabet, like that of any other language; for a character is no more than a word written with its proper con&s;onants and vowels; not indeed at length as we do, but intermingled one with another, by &s;ome peculiar method known only to them, or, perhaps, only to the learned a|mong them, and concealed from the vulgar, and more e&s;pecially from &s;trangers. It would be a difficult matter to imitate the Chine&s;e method of writing in ours, or any other European language, by joining and intermingling the vowels and con&s;onants of each word, in the &s;ame, or &s;uch like order, as they do theirs: that is, by making the fir&s;t letter the chief and large&s;t character, and placing the re&s;t regularly round it, either jointly or &s;eparately. In all other re&s;pects, the knowledge and learning of the Chine&s;e are very limited. They were almo&s;t as bad a&s;tronomers, geographers, and mu&s;icians, as any of their barbarous neighbours; and what|ever proficiency they have &s;ince made in logic, na|tural philo&s;ophy, geometry, anatomy, or any other art and &s;cience, was entirely owing to the in&s;truc|tions they received from the mi&s;&s;ionaries. They are &s;till &s;o fond of their old a&s;trology, that they mark the lucky and unlucky days in their Alma|nacs; and, indeed, they are &s;uch &s;uper&s;titious

<HEAD>CONSTITUTION, GOVERNMENT, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>The emperor of China is as de&s;potic and arbi|trary as any Oriental monarch what&s;oever; for he has an ab&s;olute power over the lives and fortunes of all his &s;ubjects, the princes of the blood not excepted. His will is a law, and his commands are not to be di&s;puted, delayed, or neglected, without the utmo&s;t hazard. Notwith&s;tanding, his government is one of the mo&s;t regular in the world, and the tribunals and magi&s;tracy are e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in the mo&s;t exact and uniform manner that can be conceived, for the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, and the due performance of all the offices of a well regulated government. For the better managing the great affairs of this va&s;t empire, he is a&s;&s;i&s;ted by two &s;overeign councils, which &s;it at Pekin, the capital: one &s;tiled extraordinary, and compo&s;ed of the princes of the blood only; the other ordinary, which, be&s;ides tho&s;e princes, con&s;i&s;ts of &s;everal man|darins, and other mini&s;ters of &s;tate, called colaos. Six other &s;uperior tribunals are held in the &s;ame city, for civil and military affairs, the authority of each extending over the whole empire, and each having a particular in&s;pection and department. Every mandarin, or governor, is obliged to tran&s;|mit to court an account of his admini&s;tration annu|ally, and is &s;everely puni&s;hed if he conceals, or endeavours to palliate, any mi&s;carriages; but, as corruption prevails to a high degree in China, he that can bribe highe&s;t, is morally &s;ure of carrying
<PB N="69" REF="690">
his point. Except the princes of the blood, and tributary kings, there is at pre&s;ent no hereditary nobility among the Chine&s;e, or any other di&s;tinction than what their places and offices, or their &s;upe|rior wealth or learning, create. The emperors of the Chine&s;e race &s;eldom appeared in public; but the pre&s;ent Tartar family &s;hew them&s;elves to the people four times every month. Such a government as a republic had never been heard of in China, till the &s;tates of Holland &s;ent an emba&s;&s;y thither; and the Dutch amba&s;&s;adors found it extremely difficult to make them comprehend what &s;ort of government the United Provinces were under, and what they meant by the high and mighty lords their ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>The forces of this empire are &s;aid to amount to five millions, being a kind of militia, that is called out only when the exigencies of the &s;tate require it. The Je&s;uits tell us, that there are in China one hundred and fifty-five capital cities, one thou&s;and three hundred and twelve of the &s;econd rank, two thou&s;and three hundred and fifty-&s;even fortified towns, ten millions of families, and fifty millions of people. They have no naval force, though they have a &s;ea-coa&s;t of &s;everal thou&s;and miles; and their &s;kill, both in navigation and the art of war, is trifling, compared to that of the Euro|peans. The revenues of the empire are &s;aid to amount to upwards of twenty millions &s;terling.</P>

<P>This country is &s;aid to be called China from the great quantities of &s;ilk it produces, the word Chin &s;ignifying &s;ilk, in the language of &s;ome of the neighbouring countries. Certain it is, that the natives know no &s;uch name, but the empire goes by the name of the family upon the throne; and we are told, that there have been no le&s;s than twenty-two
<PB N="70" REF="700">
&s;uch families, who have changed its name for their own.</P>
<P>As to the origin of the Chine&s;e nation we are quite in the dark: their hi&s;torians pretend, that the empire is of forty thou&s;and years &s;tanding; but, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e ridiculous preten&s;ions, they have no records above two thou&s;and years old, and a&s;cribe the invention of all arts and &s;ciences, even hu&s;bandry, architecture, and cloathing, to &s;everal princes, who have reigned within three or four thou&s;and years: but, had the world been forty thou&s;and years old, ploughing, planting, building, and cloathing, mu&s;t undoubtedly have been learned long before the la&s;t four thou&s;and years.</P>
<P>Some of the tran&s;lators of the Chine&s;e hi&s;tory a&s;cribe the foundation of the monarchy to Fohi, who is there &s;aid to have begun his reign about two thou&s;and nine hundred and fifty-two years be|fore Chri&s;t. This Fohi is affirmed to have been the fir&s;t who reduced mankind into &s;ocieties, and to have taught them agriculture, and other &s;ocial arts, which were afterwards improved by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. Among the&s;e Hoam-ti, &s;urnamed the Yellow empe|ror, becau&s;e he a&s;&s;umed that colour, &s;ince become peculiar to the imperial dignity, rectified the Chine&s;e cycle, invented mu&s;ic, and mu&s;ical in&s;truments, navigation, fi&s;hing, arms, and other arts. His queen, at the &s;ame time, is &s;aid to have laid the foundation of the &s;ilk manufacture, by rai&s;ing and feeding of &s;ilk worms. The&s;e two are &s;uppo&s;ed to have reigned two thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and ninety-&s;even years before Chri&s;t. Xao Hao, their &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or, began to build cities, and to &s;urround them with walis; and for the more expeditious bringing together proper materials for building, contrived the way of conveying them by carts, drawn by oxen. He died, according to the &s;ame chronology, two thou&s;and five hundred and &s;eventeen years before
<PB N="71" REF="710">
Chri&s;t, and was &s;ucceeded by his nephew, Choven-Hio, who made a law, that none but the emperor of the world &s;hould &s;acrifice to the emperor of heaven, and reformed the Calendar, ordering the year to begin at the neare&s;t new moon to the &s;pring &s;ea|&s;on. His nephew and &s;ucce&s;&s;or Ti-cho is &s;aid to have been the inventor of vocal mu&s;ic, in which he received no &s;mall help from his four wives. The&s;e &s;ix princes were followed by the two famed emperors and law-givers, Yo and Xoun, from whom the Chine&s;e received their civil and religious in&s;titutes. The&s;e two reigned one hundred and fifty years, which, joined to the reigns of the other &s;ix, make in all &s;even hundred and thirty-&s;even years; and from the&s;e eight princes de&s;cended the imperial families of Hia, Xam, Cheou, Han, Hau-hun, Chin II. Chi, Leam, Kin, Soui, Heou|eam, Heou-tam, Heou chin, Heou-han, Heou|cheou, Soum II. Yoven, and Mim. Of the fir&s;t of the&s;e were &s;eventeen emperors, who reigned four hundred and fifty-eight years: of the &s;econd, twenty-eight, who reigned &s;ix hundred and forty|four years: of the third, thirty-five, who reigned eight hundred and &s;eventy-three years: of the fourth, three, who reigned forty-three years: of the fifth, twenty-&s;even, who reigned four hundred and twenty-&s;ix years: of the &s;ixth, two, who reign|ed forty-four years: of the &s;eventh, fifteen, who reigned one hundred and fifty-five years: of the eighth, &s;even, who reigned fifty-nine years: of the ninth, five, who reigned twenty-three years: of the tenth, four, who reigned fifty-five years: of the eleventh, five, who reigned thirty-two years: of the twelfth, three, who reigned twenty-nine years: of the thirteenth, twenty, who reigned eighty-nine years: of the fourteenth, two, who reigned ten years: of the fifteenth, four, who reigned thirteen years: of the &s;ixteenth, two, who reigned eleven years: of the &s;eventeenth, two, who reigned four

There being two factions in the empire, which had engaged the whole in a civil war, the weake&s;t called in the king of Niuche, a little Tartarian kingdom, to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. This prince had no &s;ooner enabled his allies to cru&s;h their enemies, than he took occa&s;ion to pick a quarrel with the party that called him in, and made an entire conque&s;t of the country, where he &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed him&s;elf, that his po&s;terity &s;till remains in peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne. As he was very &s;en&s;ible, that his Tartars were much inferior to the Chine&s;e in number, he obliged all the Chine&s;e &s;oldiers, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who had li&s;ted among his troops, to cut off their hair, and change their dre&s;s to the Tartar fa&s;hion, in order that be|ing looked upon as Tartars, they might overawe the re&s;t. This he extended immediately after to the Chine&s;e in general; and had it not been for this politic proceeding, the Chine&s;e would &s;oon have been &s;en&s;ible of their &s;uperiority, and put an end to the Tartar u&s;urpation. But what contri|buted &s;till more to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Tar|tars, was their employing the Chine&s;e, both in their civil and military affairs, advancing the mo&s;t popular of the grandees to be viceroys and gover|nors of provinces, and thereby making them ac|ce&s;&s;ary to the &s;ubduing their own country. They remitted al&s;o to the people one-third of their taxes, governed them by their own laws, and delivered them from the tyranny the great men u&s;ed to exer|ci&s;e
<PB N="73" REF="730">
over them; &s;o that, except in the matter of their hair and habits, the Tartars &s;eem rather to have &s;ubmitted to the laws of the Chine&s;e, than to have impo&s;ed any upon them; and Tartary may now be &s;aid rather to be &s;ubject to China, than China to Tartary: for in China is the &s;eat of the empire, there the &s;upreme courts of ju&s;tice are held, there all the wealth of the united kingdoms centers, there all honours and degrees are conferred: whence China may be &s;aid to have gained a va&s;t addition of &s;trength by Tartary, and has now no enemy to fear. Their indigent northern neighbours are un|der the &s;ame &s;overeign, who keeps them &s;o much in &s;ubjection, that they are no longer in a condi|tion to di&s;turb China: mo&s;t of the petty Tartar kings are no more than his viceroys, or governors of provinces; and the emperor has forts and gar|ri&s;ons through a great part of their country. The pre&s;ent emperor is either the grand&s;on, or great|grand&s;on of Xunchi, or T&s;oute, the Tartarian prince who conquered China upwards of an hun|dred years ago.</P>
<P>The Chine&s;e monarchy, great as it is, mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed, like all others, to have had but a &s;mall beginning, e&s;pecially as their more authentic ac|counts date its infancy only about two or three hun|dred years after the flood. About this time, it is probable, &s;ome of Noah's children, or grand|children, having penetrated through the ea&s;tern parts of A&s;ia, &s;ettled on that fertile and delightful &s;pot which forms the &s;outh-ea&s;t part of China. Fohi, the founder of the Chine&s;e monarchy, from the re&s;emblance of names, and other circum&s;tances, has been &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;everal learned men, of our own and other nations, to have been the &s;ame with Noah; and &s;ome have even gone &s;o far, as to &s;up|po&s;e this patriarch to have been the fir&s;t planter of China, ju&s;t after the flood; and that the Ararat,
<PB N="74" REF="740">
mentioned by Mo&s;es, on which the ark re&s;ted, was not that ridge &s;o called in Armenia, but one of tho&s;e which divide India from China.</P>
<P>The Portugue&s;e di&s;covered this remote and opu|lent country upwards of two hundred years ago. It was indeed, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, known to the an|tients, under the name of the country of the Seres and Sinae, and &s;ome commerce was carried on be|tween them; but the va&s;t &s;andy de&s;erts and inac|ce&s;&s;ible mountains, that lie between it and India, its great di&s;tance from Europe, and the old Chi|ne&s;e policy of not admitting &s;trangers among them, or &s;uffering their own people to go into other coun|tries, made it impo&s;&s;ible for the Greeks or Romans, or any other nation on this &s;ide the Ganges, to know any thing of this country or its inhabitants, except what they might gather from the commodi|ties brought from thence, which were but few in compari&s;on with its pre&s;ent exports. After the Portugue&s;e found a way to the Ea&s;t by the &s;ea, and the Cape of Good Hope, we became better ac|quainted with China; but could not be &s;aid to know much of the true &s;tate thereof, until the zeal of the church of Rome prompted it to &s;end the Je&s;uits, and other mi&s;&s;ionaries thither, who, by their &s;uperior &s;kill in the mathematical &s;ciences, e&s;pecially a&s;tronomy and navigation, introduced them&s;elves into the acquaintance and favour of per|&s;ons of the highe&s;t rank, in&s;omuch that &s;ome of them were rai&s;ed to the dignity of mandarins, and lords of the council, and had apartments allotted them in the royal palace.</P>

<HEAD>Of the PROVINCES and CITIES of CHINA.</HEAD>
<P>The empire of China is divided into fifteen great parts or provinces, which are again divided into the following parts or di&s;tricts, viz. Neuche Korea, and Lao-tong, lying north of the great wall, the chief towns of which are Neuche, Petcheo, and Chinyam; Pekin, Xan&s;i, and Xen&s;i, lying within the great wall, and adjoining to it, of which the chief towns are Pekin, Tayen, and Sigam; Xan|tun, Nanking, and Chekiang, lying on the coa&s;t of the Chine&s;ian &s;ea, and having for their chief towns Chinchis, Nanking, Nimpo, and Chu&s;an; Honan, Huquam, and Kiam&s;i, lying towards the centre of the empire, and having for their chief towns Ho|nan, Toangfu, and Nankan; Fokien, Canton, and Quam&s;i, lying to the &s;outh, and having for their chief towns Fochen, Amoi, Canton, and Quelin; and Suchuen, Quecheu, and Yunam, lying to the we&s;t, who&s;e chief towns are Tchinteu, Quey|ang, Quecheu, and Yunam. Add to the&s;e the Chine&s;ian i&s;lands, which are Formo&s;a, Ainan, Macao, and the Ba&s;hee i&s;lands, the chief towns of which are Tamboy, Lincato, and Macao. The five northern provinces of China were former|ly called Kitay, Katay, or Cathay, and Korea, was long an independent kingdom. The cities and towns of China are all built in one form, as near as the ground will permit, that is, &s;quare. Two great &s;treets, which cro&s;s one another in the middle of the town, divide it into four quarters;
<PB N="76" REF="760">
and from the centre the four principal gates may be &s;een at once, &s;tanding due ea&s;t, we&s;t, &s;outh, and north.</P>
<P>Pekin, the capital, con&s;i&s;ts of two cities joined together, one of which is called the Old or Tartar city, and the other the New or Chine&s;e city, the latter being the mo&s;t populous, and both together about &s;ix leagues in circumference. They are &s;itu|ated in a large and fertile plain, under the 40th de|gree of north latitude, and 117&deg;. 30&prime; of ea&s;t longi|tude, about twenty miles &s;outh from the great wall. Pekin is &s;uppo&s;ed to contain upwards of two millions of inhabitants. Its walls are forty or fifty cubits high, and thick enough for &s;everal men to ride abrea&s;t upon: they are moreover flanked with &s;quare towers, about a bow-&s;hot's di|&s;tance from one another. Every gate of the city has a fortre&s;s or redoubt built before it, of equal height with the gate. The arches or gateways are built of marble, but the re&s;t of the walls of brick. The emperor's palace, together with its parks, gar|dens, canals, &amp;c. take up a va&s;t extent of ground: it &s;tands in the middle of the Tartar city, and is an oblong &s;quare, about two miles in length, and one in breadth, defended by a good wall. The &s;treets are &s;trait, broad, and &s;pacious, but unpaved, and the hou&s;es but one &s;tory high, built of brick, and covered with glazed tiles. Though the &s;treets are &s;o crowded, that people of quality are forced to have men on hor&s;eback to clear the way before them, there is not a &s;ingle woman to be &s;een among them. Few of the handicraft&s;men here work at home, but go about the &s;treets in que&s;t of bu&s;ine&s;s. In every &s;treet a corps de garde, with &s;words by their &s;ides, and whips in their hands, keep watch, day and night, cha&s;ti&s;ing, without di&s;tinction, all that cau&s;e any di&s;turbance, and confining &s;uch as make any re&s;i&s;tance. So &s;trict a di&s;cipline is ob&s;erved, both

by the &s;oldiery and citizens under the juri&s;diction of the governor, that one &s;hall hardly hear, in &s;eve|ral years, of an hou&s;e being broke open, or a man murdered; which is &s;o much the more to be ad|mired amid&s;t &s;uch an infinite multitude, and mix|ture of Tartars and Chine&s;e. The merchandizes and trea&s;ures of the Indies, &amp;c. being tran&s;ported hither from all parts, by means of the Ea&s;tern or Yellow Sea and the royal canals, and &s;everal thou|&s;ands of the emperor's ve&s;&s;els, be&s;ides a much larger number of others belonging to private per&s;ons, be|ing continually employed in &s;upplying both court and city with every thing that can be wi&s;hed for, all &s;orts of commodities and provi&s;ions are &s;ur|pri&s;ingly cheap and plentiful.</P>
<P>The city of Quang-Chew, Quan-tong, Quan|tun, Kantun, or, as it is commonly called by the Europeans, Canton, is &s;ituated in latitude 23&deg;. 12&prime;. and longitude 3&deg;. 31&prime;. we&s;t from the meridian of Pekin, at the mouth of the Taho or Great River, which is here wide and &s;pacious, and forms the bay called Hu-men, or the Tyger's Gate, tho' it hath nothing terrible in it but its name, and &s;ome few forts, which are only built to keep off pirates. It is not only one of the large&s;t, being computed with the &s;uburbs to be above twenty miles in compa&s;s, but likewi&s;e, on account of its advantageous &s;ituation, one of the riche&s;t, fine&s;t, be&s;t peopled, and mo&s;t trading cities in China, the large&s;t ve&s;&s;els being ea|&s;ily brought to the fine canals that &s;urround it, and the port and city being perpetually thronged with &s;hips and merchants, and &s;tored with the riche&s;t commodities of all kinds from Europe, and mo&s;t parts of India. The number of inhabitants, ex|clu&s;ive of &s;trangers, is computed to be at lea&s;t a million. The &s;treets are &s;trait and long, neat, and well paved; but, excepting a few which are adorn|ed with palaces, temples, triumphal arches, and
<PB N="78" REF="780">
&s;uch like &s;plendid edifices, are rather narrow than wide. The harbour, quay, and canals, are cover|ed with &s;uch an infinite number of barges, boats, and other ve&s;&s;els, and &s;o clo&s;e together, that they look like a huge floating city. The mandarin, who re&s;ides here as viceroy, hath a &s;tately palace in one of the mo&s;t di&s;tant parts of the city. The land|&s;cape on each &s;ide the river, between the city and the bay, is one of the mo&s;t delightful that can be imagined. On one &s;ide we behold a va&s;t extent of lovely green meadows, terminated only by the hori|zon: on the other, groves and little hills appear, ri&s;ing up in form of amphitheatres, which are a&s;cended by &s;teps made of green &s;ods. Here your &s;ight is delighted with high rocks, covered with mo&s;s; there with country-&s;eats, half-buried among&s;t verdant cop&s;es: here again, one meets with canals, diver&s;ified with &s;mall i&s;lands, or beau|tiful banks, adorned with &s;tately trees, which yield a mo&s;t delightful &s;hade, verdure, and fragrance; and there &s;ome &s;pacious villages, encompa&s;&s;ed with plains, woods, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Among other villages, there is one about twelve miles from Canton, called Fo-&s;han or Fu-xan, which is &s;aid to be nine miles in compa&s;s, and to contain at lea&s;t a million of &s;ouls, mo&s;tly employed in manufacturing goods for the market of that me|tropolis.</P>
<P>At the entrance into the bay of Canton &s;tands the famed Portugue&s;e port of Makau, or, as it is vulgarly called, Macao, on a &s;mall penin&s;ula, joined to the continent by a narrow neck of land, acro&s;s which they have built a wall. The inhabi|tants con&s;i&s;t mo&s;tly of mongrel Portugue&s;e and Chine&s;e. The former have a &s;mall factory and garri&s;on here, under a captain-general, appointed by the king of Portugal, and a bi&s;hop. The officers are all maintained by the city, which allows the
<PB N="79" REF="790">
captain-general a piece of eight per day, and three thou&s;and every three years, five hundred to the bi|&s;hop per annum, and &s;o in proportion to the infe|rior ones, which charge is defrayed by a duty of ten per cent. upon all Portugue&s;e goods, and two per cent. on money. Over and above the&s;e im|po&s;itions, others mu&s;t be paid to the Chine&s;e go|vernment, and the mandarin who commands in it. The viceroy al&s;o comes often to vi&s;it it, and mu&s;t be entertained in a grand manner, and glutted with pre&s;ents, &amp;c. To all which hard&s;hips they are obliged to &s;ubmit, becau&s;e, all their provi&s;ions com|ing to them from the Chine&s;e, they might be &s;tarved by them upon the lea&s;t di&s;gu&s;t. The com|merce of Macao was very great and advantageous while the Portugue&s;e were permitted to trade with Japan, but it is now at a very low ebb.</P>
<P>Without the gates of every town in China there are u&s;ually two magnificent towers erected; and near each tower is a temple of idols, and another dedicated to the genius and guardian-angel of the place. In almo&s;t every city are triumphal arches, built to the honour of &s;ome great men, who have been benefactors to their country; with colleges and temples, founded in memory of their great philo&s;opher Confucius, where his precepts, and doctrines are taught. Without the gates of Nan|king, formerly the capital of China, before the im|perial re&s;idence was removed to Pekin, there are two towers built alike, in the form of a cone. One of them is called the Porcelain Tower, being faced therewith on the out&s;ide. It is of an octangular figure, contains nine &s;tories, and is two hundred feet high. Above the eighth &s;tory there is a cu|pola, which ri&s;es thirty feet higher than the tower, and on the top is a very large golden ball. The tower has &s;tood above three hundred years, ap|pears very beautiful, and is &s;aid to be the be&s;t con|&s;tructed and noble&s;t &s;tructure in the Ea&s;t.</P>

The great wall, which &s;eparates China from Tartary, begins in the province of Xen&s;i, which lies on the north-we&s;t of China, in about 38&deg;. north latitude, and is carried over mountains and vallies, terminating at the Kang, between the provinces of Pekin and Laotonge The whole cour&s;e of it, including the windings, mea&s;ures about fifteen hundred miles. It is almo&s;t all built with brick, and &s;uch well tempered mortar, that it has now &s;tood about eighteen hundred years, having been built by the emperor Chiho-hamti, to prevent the incur&s;ions of the Tartars, and is very little de|cayed. Its height is about thirty feet, and it is broad enough for eight people to ride a-brea&s;t. It is fortified all along by &s;quare towers, at the di|&s;tance of a mile from each other.</P>

Its great|e&s;t breadth is towards the middle, and that is little more than one degree, or &s;ixty miles. The land lies high, and is very mountainous, the coa&s;t rocky, and without any harbours or creeks by which a &s;hip of any bulk may approach it, except that of Tay-wan, which is at the mouth of a river, and narrow, but when &s;hips are got in they are &s;afe, and &s;heltered from all winds. The air, though very hot in &s;ummer, is very &s;erene and healthy, being much allayed by con&s;tant breezes, which fan it on all &s;ides. Though the &s;oil is mo&s;tly mountainous, it produces rice, &s;ugar, tobacco, tea, bananas, ana|nas,

papayas, guavoes, cocoas, peaches, apricots, figs, grapes, pomegranates, che&s;nuts, &s;ome of the fine&s;t citrons and oranges, &s;everal &s;orts of &s;pices, phy&s;ical and other herbs, and roots. The moun|tains contain rich mines of gold, &s;ilver, copper, and &s;ulphur: the la&s;t in &s;uch abundance, that it makes the i&s;land &s;ubject to earthquakes. The i&s;land is &s;aid to abound with oxen, &s;heep, goats, hogs, and deer of various &s;orts; and the woods, we are told, are infe&s;ted with tygers, leopards, and other wild bea&s;ts, of the furs of which the natives make a con&s;iderable traffic. The inhabitants of the inland parts are de&s;cribed as a &s;avage race, al|together independent of the Chine&s;e, who are po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed only of the northern coa&s;ts.</P>

<HEAD>INDIA, or the EAST-INDIES.</HEAD>
<P>INDIA, commonly called the Ea&s;t-Indies, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the We&s;t, takes its name, according to &s;ome authors, from the river Indus; but, according to others, from the inhabitants, named Indows, Hindows, or Hind&ucirc;s: hence it is called, by the Turks and Per&s;ians, Hindu&s;tan, or the country of the Hind&ucirc;s; of which Indo&s;tan, a name u&s;ed by the Europeans, is a corruption. By India, or the Ea&s;t-Indies, Europeans mean not only a great part of the continent of A&s;ia, but al&s;o of the i&s;lands of the ocean, to the &s;outh of it. he continent of India is &s;ituated between the 84th and 127th degrees of ea&s;t long, and between 1&deg;. 12&prime;. and 36&deg;. of north latitude; containing in length, from we&s;t to ea&s;t, about two thou&s;and three hun|dred
<PB N="82" REF="820">
and fifteen miles, and in breadth, from &s;outh to north, two thou&s;and one hundred and ten miles. It is bounded on the north by the countries of Great and Little Thibet; on the &s;outh by the Indian Ocean; on the ea&s;t by China, and the Chine&s;e Sea; and on the we&s;t by Per&s;ia, and the Indian Sea.</P>
<P>This large region is divided into three great parts, viz. the penin&s;ula without, or beyond the Ganges; the main-land; and the penin&s;ula within, or on this &s;ide the Ganges.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The PENINSULA of INDIA without or be|yond the GANGES, otherwi&s;e called the FUR|THER PENINSULA.</HEAD>
<P>This penin&s;ula, in its mo&s;t extended &s;en&s;e, is bounded on the north by part of Thibet and China; on the ea&s;t by China, and the Chine&s;ian Sea; by the &s;ame &s;ea, and the Streights of Malacca, on the &s;outh; and by the bay of Bengal, and the Hither India, on the we&s;t. It &s;tretches its whole length into the &s;ea, lying between the 107th and 127th degrees of ea&s;t longitude, and between the 1&s;t and 27th of north latitude; and extending in length, from north to &s;outh, about a thou&s;and miles, and in breadth, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, nine hundred at mo&s;t.</P>
<P>It would be in vain to &s;eek for any lights with re&s;pect to this country in the writings of the an|tients, to whom it was utterly unknown; and even at pre&s;ent, many parts are &s;o, or at lea&s;t our know|ledge of them is very imperfect.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the air of this penin&s;ula, in the northern parts it is very dry and healthful; but the &s;outhern provinces, being very hot and moi&s;t, e&s;pecially in the vallies and low-lands near the &s;ea and the rivers, are not &s;o healthy; and yet there the natives build mo&s;t of their towns, the

the hou&s;es &s;tanding upon high pillars, to &s;ecure them from the floods during the rainy &s;ea&s;on, at which time they have no communication with one another but by boats; and &s;uch &s;torms of wind, thunder, and lightning, happen about the equi|noxes, on the &s;hifting of the mon&s;oons, as are &s;el|dom &s;een in Europe. The year is not divided into winter and &s;ummer, as with us; but into the wet and dry &s;ea&s;ons, or into the ea&s;terly and we&s;terly mon&s;oons, which term is &s;ometimes applied to tho&s;e periodical winds, and &s;ometimes to the wet and dry weather.</P>
<P>There are &s;ea and land breezes near the coa&s;t, which &s;hift every twelve hours, as in Hither India, when the &s;tormy weather cea&s;es.</P>
<P>As to religion, though it is principally the &s;ame through the whole penin&s;ula, yet one nation differs from another in their ceremonies, in their &s;ubaltern deities, their &s;aints, and even the founders of their re&s;pective forms; which are to be con&s;idered as &s;o many different &s;ects of the &s;ame faith. Nor are our readers, on account of the great agreement that will be found between the external form and ob|jects of wor&s;hip of this penin&s;ula, and tho&s;e of the Hither, to conclude, that the religion is the &s;ame in both regions; for the idolatry of the Malabars, &amp;c. con&s;i&s;ts in trithei&s;m, or the adoration of three inferior gods, appointed by the Supreme Being to make and govern the univer&s;e; whereas, that of the Peguers, Siame&s;e, &amp;c. came originally from Thibet, and has for its founder, as well as prime object of wor&s;hip, a per&s;on who, about a thou&s;and years be|fore the Chri&s;tian aera, preached his fal&s;e religion in that country. This impo&s;tor, in&s;tead of adopting the Br&acirc;man theology, which propo&s;es three gods for the prime objects of wor&s;hip, &s;ubordinate to, and created by, the Supreme Being, declared him|&s;elf to be the Supreme Being, who had a&s;&s;umed a
<PB N="84" REF="840">
human form. Again, whereas the Indian deities were invi&s;ible to their wor&s;hippers, he propo&s;ed to re&s;ide corporally among his votaries, and receive their adorations in per&s;on. La&s;tly, to give his followers a more convincing proof of the transformation of their god, as well as of the doctrine of the metemp|&s;ycho&s;is, than the Indians had, he gave out, that he would, from time to time, a&s;cend to heaven, and return again in a different body. This pre|tended &s;upreme deity, in different countries, has dif|ferent appellations: in China he is called Fo, and She kija; in Tonquin or Tong king, Thikka; in Japan, Shakka; and in Thibet, La. The idola|try of Thibet extends much farther than that of the Br&acirc;mins; being &s;pread over Great Tartary from we&s;t to ea&s;t, China, Japan, and the Oriental I&s;lands, be&s;ides the countries contained in the Farther Pe|nin&s;ula of the Indies.</P>
<P>This va&s;t region is in general a very plentiful country for fruits, &s;ilks, elephants, metals, drugs, corn, rice, pepper, and oil. Be&s;ides this, it is rich in gold, and precious &s;tones, &s;uch as diamonds, rubies, topazes, amethy&s;ts, and other kinds, with which a great trade is driven. Tong-king, it is true, has neither corn nor wine of its own; but, to make amends, it enjoys a very good and temperate air, while mo&s;t of the other countries &s;uffer under exce&s;&s;ive heats. There are mountains running from north to &s;outh, almo&s;t the whole length of the country; but near the &s;ea are low|lands, annually overflowed in the rainy &s;ea&s;on, which la&s;ts half the year, at lea&s;t, in the &s;outhern provinces.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to their political con&s;titution, mo&s;t of the countries in this part of India are ab&s;olute monarchies, and as &s;ubject to frequent revolutions as that of Turkey.</P>

Having premi&s;ed thus much in general concern|ing this penin&s;ula, we now proceed to &s;ay &s;ome|thing in particular of the &s;everal dominions and countries comprized within it, which may be re|duced to the&s;e eleven, viz. A&s;&s;am, Acham, or A|zem, Tipra, Arrakan, Pegu, Ava, Laos, Siam, Malacca, Tonquin or Tong-king, Cochin-China, and Kamboia.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>The KINGDOM of ASSAM.</HEAD>
<P>The kingdom of A&s;&s;am, called al&s;o Acham and Azem, has Tipra and Arrakan on the &s;outh; the mountains of Thibet on the north, the Great Mo|gul's dominions on the we&s;t, from which it &s;eems to be &s;eparated by the river, called the Great Bramaputren, or Barremporter, that falls into the Ganges; and on the ea&s;t the lake Chiamay. It was hardly known before Am&icirc;r Jemla, general of Aurengz&ecirc;b, conquered it, about the middle of the la&s;t century.</P>
<P>This kingdom is one of the be&s;t in A&s;ia, pro|ducing every thing that is nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;u&s;tenance of man. Mines of gold, &s;ilver, &s;teel, lead, and iron, are found here, the property of which the king has re&s;erved for him&s;elf, on condition of not levying any &s;ub&s;idies on his people; and none but &s;laves pur|cha&s;ed from his neighbours, are employed in work|ing them. This country affords al&s;o great &s;tore of &s;ilk, but coar&s;e. There is one kind &s;pun by animals, like our &s;ilk-worms, but which live all the year under trees. The &s;ilks made of it have a fine glo&s;s, but fret pre&s;ently. They wa&s;h them in a lie, made of the a&s;hes of the leaves of Adam's fig-tree, which makes them white as &s;now. Here is al&s;o &s;tore of gum lack, of two &s;orts. One &s;ort grows under the trees, and is of a red colour, with who&s;e expre&s;&s;ed juice they paint their linen: the remaining
<PB N="86" REF="860">
&s;ub&s;tance &s;erves to varni&s;h cabinets, and make wax; for which u&s;e it is the be&s;t in all the Ea&s;t. As for the gold, they neither &s;end it abroad, nor coin it into money; but make it all into ingots, which pa&s;s in trade among the inhabitants. How|ever, the &s;ilver is coined by the king into &s;mall pieces, to the value of ten &s;ous each.</P>
<P>The inhabitants generally have good complec|tions: only they who live towards the &s;outh are more &s;warthy than the re&s;t, neither are they &s;o well featured; and the women are &s;omewhat flat-no&s;ed: however, to make amends, they are not &s;o &s;ubject to wens, or &s;wellings in their throats, as tho&s;e who dwell to the north, occa&s;ioned by the bad water. The&s;e &s;outhern people go quite naked; only they cover their privities, and wear on their heads a blue cap or bonnet, hung about with boar's teeth. They pierce holes in their ears, which are an inch wide, and hang in them pieces of gold and &s;ilver. They are very fond of bracelets, made of coral and amber, for the rich; while the meaner &s;ort take up with tho&s;e of tortoi&s;e, and other large &s;hells, &s;awed into rings.</P>
<P>As the inhabitants of Azem pay no taxes, they live at their ea&s;e, with each a hou&s;e, and common|ly an elephant to carry his wives; for they marry four, and a&s;&s;ign to every one her peculiar office or bu&s;ine&s;s in the family. Although provi&s;ions are &s;o very plenty with them, yet they prefer dog's fle&s;h to all others. They have plenty of excellent vines; but dry the grapes to make brandy, in&s;tead of wine. They have no &s;alt but what is artificial, made from two &s;orts of a&s;hes; the fir&s;t of which are tho&s;e of the green &s;tuff that &s;wims on &s;tagnant waters, and is the food of ducks and frogs, and the others tho&s;e of the leaves of Adam's fig tree.</P>
<P>Tradition attributes to this people the invention of gunpowder; which having pa&s;&s;ed from Azem to
<PB N="87" REF="870">
Pegu, and from Pegu to China, gave occa&s;ion to the common opinion, that the Chine&s;e were the in|ventors of it. This, however, we are told, is cer|tain, that Am&icirc;r Jemla, or, as he is called by &s;ome, Mirgimola, brought from Azem &s;everal pieces of artillery, all of iron, and &s;tore of excellent powder, both made in the &s;ame country. The princes re|&s;ide in the city of Kimmerouf, about twenty-five or thirty days journey from the antient capital, which bore the &s;ame name: but their tombs, and tho&s;e of all the royal family, are in the city of Azo, on the river Laquia. Every prince builds a kind of chapel in the great pagoda, to &s;erve for his burial|place; and being per&s;uaded that after their death they go to another world, and that tho&s;e who die &s;ullied by any crime &s;uffer a great deal, chiefly by hunger and thir&s;t, they place all nece&s;&s;aries near the corp&s;e, to &s;erve them as they may want. The king is interred with tho&s;e idols of gold and &s;ilver which he wor&s;hipped in his life-time, together with a live elephant, twelve camels, &s;ix hor&s;es, and a great number of hounds, in the belief that all the&s;e things will be u&s;eful to him in the other world. At the king's death too, it is &s;aid, the woman whom he loved be&s;t, and the principal officers of his hou&s;hold, poi&s;on them&s;elves, that they may have the glory of being interred with him, and of &s;erv|ing him in a future &s;tate. If a private per&s;on, all his friends and relations mu&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;t at his funeral, and every one mu&s;t throw into the grave the brace|lets and other ornaments he wears.</P>

<HEAD>The KINGDOM of TIPRA.</HEAD>
<P>This kingdom, who&s;e name is al&s;o written Tip|pora and Tippera, lies to the north of Arrakan, and, as it &s;hould &s;eem, to the &s;outh of Azem. Its ea&s;tern boundary is &s;uppo&s;ed to be either the great
<PB N="88" REF="880">
river T&s;anpu, that pa&s;&s;es through Arrakan, or one that falls into it; and its we&s;tern either Arrakan, or the river Bramaputren, before mentioned. As to its dimen&s;ions, they are equally undetermined. To|wards the end of the la&s;t century, Tipra was &s;ub|ject to the king of Arrakan, in which &s;tate it has probably continued ever &s;ince. This country has little to invite foreign merchants. There is indeed a gold mine, but its metal is very coar&s;e; and a &s;ort of very coar&s;e &s;ilk: both the&s;e commodities are &s;ent to China, from whence in return, is brought &s;ilver.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The KINGDOM of ARRAKAN or RAKAN.</HEAD>
<P>Arrakan is &s;ituated to the &s;outh of Tipra; and has on the ea&s;t the kingdoms of Ava and Pegu; on the we&s;t it is bounded by Bengal, from which it is &s;eparated by the river of Chatigan, and gulph of Bengal. It extends from 16&deg;. 30&prime;. to 24&deg;. of latitude; that is, five hundred and ten geo|graphical, or five hundred and eighty-&s;ix Engli&s;h, miles; of which three hundred and eighty are &s;ea-coa&s;t, reaching from Cape Negrais in the &s;outh, to Chatigan in the north. Its breadth north|wards is about two hundred and ten miles; but from Chatigan &s;outhward it decrea&s;es gradually to Cape Negrais, where it extends only a few miles.</P>
<P>The &s;ea-coa&s;t, though of great extent, is in|habited but in a few places, where they are able to defend the products of the ground from the ravages of wild elephants and buffaloes, and their cattle from the claws of numerous tigers, who would &s;oon lay all wa&s;te, if the people attempted to &s;ettle in tho&s;e parts. There are a great many i&s;lands on the Arrakan coa&s;t, among which are tho&s;e called the Buffalo I&s;les, and the Negrais. The tides along the &s;ame coa&s;t are remarkably &s;trong and high: they ri&s;e twelve or fifteen feet
<PB N="89" REF="890">
in the rivers, and to eighteen or twenty during the &s;pring-tides; at which time, by the rapidity of the currents, during the ebb and flood, &s;hips perform great voyages in a &s;hort time.</P>
<P>The air of Arrakan is very good, and the inha|bitants are never troubled with pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es. The country abounds with meadows and pa&s;ture lands, well watered with rivers and brooks; the plains are exceeding fertile, and the mountains green. The number of orchards and plea&s;ure-gar|dens is infinite; and they are plea&s;ant and green all the year round, although, during the winter, which holds from Augu&s;t to October, the weather is al|mo&s;t continually moi&s;t and rainy, accompanied with &s;torms. To make amends, the &s;ummer which &s;uc|ceeds is charming, and then they gather in their har|ve&s;t. They have all the vegetable nece&s;&s;aries of life in abundance, excepting wheat and rye. In&s;tead of bread, they boil rice until the water di&s;appears, and it becomes a &s;olid ma&s;s. As to the air, though the country lies in &s;o warm a latitude, yet it &s;ome|times freezes very inten&s;ely, when the north-ea&s;t wind blows. Although there are variety of tame and wild bea&s;ts in Arrakan, yet, hor&s;es being very &s;carce, they u&s;e, in&s;tead of them, buffaloes, for ploughing and other &s;ervices. The&s;e animals are very large and &s;trong, with terrible horns, wherewith they pre&s;ently gore to death tho&s;e whom they attack; as they do &s;trangers who pa&s;s along the roads, near which they commonly feed, e&s;pecially if they wear any thing which is red, a colour which enrages them. They are &s;o &s;ubtle as to let a man pa&s;s them quietly, and then, running at him full-drive, to&s;s him with their horns: for all this, they are very obedient to the blacks, who keep them; and, at the &s;ound of a horn, gather about them, let them get upon their backs, and, at their command, will carry them &s;afely over the mo&s;t rapid
<PB N="90" REF="900">
rivers, or rugged ways, the re&s;t following one af|ter another. Among other animals, there are in|finite numbers of goats, and a great deal of game. There is likewi&s;e plenty of gee&s;e, ducks, and fowl, together with excellent fi&s;h.</P>
<P>The people of Arrakan e&s;teem a broad flat fore|head, which they give their children, by binding hard on that part a plate of lead as &s;oon as they are born, letting it lie on till the effect be produced. Their no&s;trils are large and open; their eyes &s;mall, but quick; their ears reach down to their &s;houl|ders, like tho&s;e of the Malabars; and they are very fond of a dark purple colour.</P>
<P>The people of condition wear a ve&s;t, or &s;hirt, of fine white calico, which &s;its clo&s;e to the body and arms. Over it they have a long gown of the &s;ame kind, which buttons round the arms, and tied clo&s;e upon the brea&s;t with ribbons. Be&s;ides this, they have an apron, which covers the belly and thighs before, with another piece of white calico like a bag, which, gathered in many folds, covers the parts behind, and is tied round the wai&s;t, from whence it hangs; &s;o that they look as if they car|ried a large bundle of cloth about them. They let their hair grow long, tying it in tre&s;&s;es behind the head, like the women in Holland, and adorn it with fine cloth, made up in knots.</P>
<P>The women, who are tolerably fair, wear a kind of flowered gau&s;e, which is tran&s;parent, and, co|vering the bo&s;om, pa&s;&s;es over the &s;houlders. They likewi&s;e fa&s;ten about their wai&s;t an apron of fine calico, which goes three or four times round them, and reaches to their feet. They who are rich wear a &s;ilk &s;carf over one of their arms. Their hair is not tied, but done into buckles, in an agreeable manner. They &s;tretch their ears by boring them when very young, and putting in the holes rolls of parchment, or the like, which they enlarge from
<PB N="91" REF="910">
time to time: they wear in them rings of gla&s;s, &s;ilver, or other materials, which make a jingling again&s;t the neck as they go along. Sometimes they have bracelets all the way up their arms to the elbows, and from the ancles to the calves of their legs; but the genteeler &s;ort content them|&s;elves with a few japanned ones.</P>
<P>The people in general are very o&s;tentatious, and u&s;ually make an appearance beyond their abilities. In their entertainments they have plenty of provi|&s;ions; but then they are &s;uch as are neither plea|&s;ing to the eye nor ta&s;te. They mix with their choice&s;t di&s;hes the fle&s;h of rats, mice, &s;erpents, and other loath&s;ome animals. They never eat fi&s;h till it is in a &s;tate of corruption, thinking it has the be&s;t reli&s;h when it &s;tinks mo&s;t. In&s;tead of bread they eat rice, both parched and brui&s;ed, or otherwi&s;e ordered in the flour. Their u&s;ual drink is water, or a liquor called auze, which is the juice of a tree much like the palm.</P>
<P>The people of Arrakan have an aver&s;ion to get|ting a woman's maidenhead, which they look on as low kind of drudgery; and therefore hire the Dutch &s;ailors, or other &s;trangers, to ea&s;e them of that trouble. The virgins, who have been thus deflowered, are in mo&s;t e&s;teem; and the men, who are inclined to marry, that they may not be de|ceived, generally chu&s;e tho&s;e who are big with child. The men are allowed &s;everal wives; they may likewi&s;e keep as many concubines as their circum&s;tances will admit of.</P>
<P>When a per&s;on falls &s;ick, &s;everal ridiculous ce|remonies, or rather pieces of prie&s;t-craft, mu&s;t be performed. One is a &s;acrifice, called Kalouko, to Chaor Baos, the god of the four winds, whom they look upon as the author of all di&s;tempers. This &s;acrifice con&s;i&s;ts of fowls, hogs, and other animals, on which the prie&s;ts fea&s;t them&s;elves af|ter
<PB N="92" REF="920">
it hath been offered to the idol. By another, called a Talagno, the &s;ick per&s;on's wife, or near|e&s;t relation, is obliged to make a vow, to fea&s;t the prie&s;ts, and their relations, eight days together, before an idol, in a room hung with rich tape&s;try, and to dance every day, while the fea&s;ting la&s;ts, till he has quite exhau&s;ted his &s;pirits, and drops down on the &s;pot. If after the Talagno is compleated, the patient happens to recover, he is carried to the pagod, where he is anointed, and perfumed with oils, from head to foot: but if on the contrary, he dies, the prie&s;t tells his relations, that the &s;acrifices were very acceptable to the gods, but that they did not grant him a longer life, becau&s;e they de|&s;igned him a greater favour, by taking him to them&s;elves. They al&s;o ob&s;erve a great many &s;uper|&s;titious and ridiculous ceremonies at their funerals, which being over, the body is carried into the field, and burnt to a&s;hes. The raulin, or prie&s;t, kindles the fire, while the relations attend, clad in white, which is their mourning colour. At their funerals they have always hired mourners, who pretend much &s;orrow. They call hell the hou&s;e of &s;moke, and hold the metemp&s;ycho&s;is, or tran&s;migration of fouls. When a per&s;on is afflicted with any grie|vous di&s;ea&s;e, that is judged to be incurable, he is expo&s;ed on the bank of &s;ome river, where he is &s;oon either carried away or drowned. This they call humanity to the &s;ick per&s;on, who is thus, they &s;ay, delivered from a mo&s;t mi&s;erable &s;tate here, and &s;ent to enjoy great happine&s;s in heaven. Tho&s;e al&s;o who cannot afford wood, which is very dear in this country, to burn the bodies of the dead, expo&s;e them in the &s;ame manner. This attracts great numbers of ravens, kites, and other birds of prey, which not only feed on the corp&s;e, but at|tack buffaloes, and other cattle, fixing on their
<PB N="93" REF="930">
backs, and tearing off the fle&s;h, in &s;pite of all their efforts to &s;hake them off.</P>
<P>The people of Arrakan trade very little by &s;ea. All their navigation extends no farther than Bengal and Pegu. Very few of the traders are natives of Arrakan; but what foreign commerce there is in this country, is carried on by Mohammedans, who are &s;ettled here in great numbers, particularly at Bundel. Of the&s;e, &s;ome trade in elephants, which they &s;end to Orixa, the coa&s;t of Coromandel, Gol|conda, and Per&s;ia; and, in return, carry back calicoes, &s;ilks, &s;piceries, and the like. The &s;ub|jects of the Great Mogul &s;ometimes bring from hence timber for building, lead, tin, &s;tick-lack, and elephants teeth; and &s;ometimes they meet with bargains of diamonds, rubies, other precious &s;tones, and even gold rupees.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Arrakan are idolaters, wor|&s;hipping devoutly their images made of clay, baked in the &s;un. Their temples are built in the form of pyramids, or &s;pires; and &s;ome, it is &s;aid, contain no fewer than twenty thou&s;and idols. Be|&s;ides the temple idols, they have their dome&s;tic ones. To both &s;orts they offer victuals every day; and both are cloathed by them in winter, that they may not catch cold. They wear the mark of their hou&s;hold god, branded on their arms, &s;ides, and &s;houlders.</P>
<P>One of their idols, called Quiay Poragray, is carried every year in proce&s;&s;ion in a heavy chariot, with ninety of the prie&s;ts, cloathed in yellow &s;attin. On this occa&s;ion many of the mo&s;t zealous throw them&s;elves under the wheels, others hang them|&s;elves on hooks, fa&s;tened for the purpo&s;e, and &s;prinkle him with their blood. The&s;e martyrs to folly are in &s;uch veneration with the people, that he thinks him&s;elf happy on whom one drop of their blood happens to light; nay, the hooks are taken
<PB N="94" REF="940">
down by the prie&s;ts, and carefully pre&s;erved at &s;acred relics. All the prie&s;thood here are cloathed in yellow, and have their head &s;haven: all go un|covered, except tho&s;e of the highe&s;t order, called Pungrini, who wear a yellow mitre. They are obliged by vow to live &s;ingle, and, in ca&s;e of di&s;|obedience, are degraded. Their hou&s;es are either near the pagods, on rocks, or on little hills, where they live pretty much &s;eque&s;tered from the world. They have among them many hermits, like the Joghis, of the we&s;tern parts of India, called Tali|poi, or Talapoins, who inflict on them&s;elves very rigorous penances, for which they are held in great e&s;teem by the people.</P>
<P>The government of Arrakan is in the hands of twelve princes, &s;ubordinate to the emperor, or chief king, who keeps his court in the city of Arra|kan. The inferior princes, who are al&s;o honoured with the title of kings, re&s;ide in the other princi|pal cities, in twelve royal palaces, with each a great &s;eraglio, as well for their own women, as tho&s;e they educate for the king of all the re&s;t.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>The principal places in this COUNTRY are,</HEAD>
<P>Arrakan, which gives name to it, and is &s;aid to be a very large city, &s;ituated on a river, which falls about forty-five or fifty miles below it, into the Gulph of Bengal, by two channels, the one at Orietan, and the other at Dobazi, or Duabakam. Mo&s;t of the hou&s;es are not above &s;ix feet high at mo&s;t, and are built with the branches of palm|trees, bamb&ucirc;-canes, and cocoa-leaves. They rec|kon no fewer than &s;ix hundred pagods in this me|tropolis. The king's palace is va&s;tly large; &s;ome of the apartments are built with red and white &s;an|dal, a &s;ort of eagle wood, and other odoriferous timber, and overlaid with gold. Here are to be

&s;een &s;even idols, each the height of a man, ca&s;t in gold, two inches thick, and adorned with rubies, emeralds, &s;apphires, and diamonds of an extra|ordinary &s;ize, on their foreheads, brea&s;ts, arms, and about their middle.</P>
<P>Orietan, a maritime city, &s;ituated, as we ob|&s;erved already, at one of the mouths of the river that runs by Arrakan. It is the capital of one of the twelve provinces, or petty kingdoms, and is much re&s;orted to by merchants from all parts of India, and even China and Japan.</P>
<P>Peroem, a city of good trade, being &s;ituated near the &s;ea, with a good harbour.</P>
<P>Ramu, a con&s;iderable city, &s;ituated on the coa&s;t, near a river, &s;everal days journey from Peroem.</P>
<P>Dianga, a city, &s;ituated on the frontiers of Ar|rakan, towards Bengal, and inhabited chiefly by Portugue&s;e fugitives, or their de&s;cendants, who enjoy great privileges by the grant of the king.</P>
<P>Other places on this coa&s;t &s;ubject to the king of Arrakan are Dobazi, or Duabakem, and Chu|dabi, both much frequented by foreign merchants; Koromoria, Sedoa, Zara, and port Megaeni, with &s;everal i&s;lands in the Gulph.</P>

<HEAD>The KINGDOM of PEGU.</HEAD>
<P>The kingdom of Pegu, properly &s;o called, is bounded on the north by tho&s;e of Arrakan and Ava; on the ea&s;t by the Upper and Lower Siam; on the &s;outh by part of Siam, and the &s;ea; and on the we&s;t by the &s;ea and part of Arra|kan: lying between the 110th and 116th degrees of longitude, and between the 14th and 19th de|grees of north latitude; &s;o that it is about three hundred and fifty Engli&s;h miles in length from &s;outh to north, and nearly the &s;ame in breadth from we&s;t to ea&s;t. This kingdom, with tho&s;e of
<PB N="96" REF="960">
Ava, Jangoma, and &s;ome others, are &s;aid not long &s;ince to have formed but one dominion, under the name of the empire of Ava; but whether that is the ca&s;e at pre&s;ent, or not, cannot be affirmed with any certainty, the &s;everal countries in this part of the world being &s;ubject to frequent revolutions, and continually changing their ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>Pegu &s;eems to be a flat country, without any con&s;iderable mountains, excepting tho&s;e that &s;ur|round it, and &s;erve for a frontier towards the land.</P>
<P>Among its rivers the mo&s;t remarkable are the&s;e of Pegu and Ava, &s;o called from the capitals, which are &s;ituated on their banks. The former, which is very large, and &s;eems to have its ri&s;e in the mountains on the borders of China, after pa&s;&s;ing to the we&s;t of the capital city, falls into the &s;ea with a very large mouth, about thirty miles below it, having been fir&s;t joined by that of Ava.</P>
<P>The air of Pegu is very healthy, and pre&s;ently recovers &s;ick &s;trangers. The &s;oil al&s;o is very rich and fertile in corn, rice, fruit, and roots; being enriched by the inundations of the abovementioned river, which are almo&s;t incredible, extending a|bove thirty leagues beyond its channel. It pro|duces al&s;o good timber of &s;everal kinds. The country abounds with elephants, buffaloes, goats, hogs, and other animals, particularly game; and deer is &s;o plenty in September and October, that one may be bought for three or four pence: they are very fle&s;hy, but have no fat. There is &s;tore of good poultry; the cocks are va&s;tly large, and the hens very beautiful. As for fi&s;h, there are many &s;orts, and well-ta&s;ted. In Pegu are found mines not only of iron, tin, and lead, or rather a kind of copper, or mixture of copper and lead, but al&s;o of rubies, diamonds, and &s;apphires. The rubies are the be&s;t in the world; but the dia|monds are &s;mall, and only found in the craws of
<PB N="97" REF="970">
poultry and phea&s;ants. Be&s;ides, only one family has the privilege of &s;elling them; and none dare open the ground to dig for them. The rubies are found in a mountain in the province of Kablan, or Kapelan, between the city of Pegu and the port of Sirian.</P>
<P>The inhabitants are of an olive, or rather a tawny complexion. The women are branded by &s;ome travellers, as having &s;hook off all mode&s;ty, on ac|count of their expo&s;ing &s;ome parts of their bodies which ought to be concealed from &s;ight. Some al&s;o tells us, that the men wear bells, which at a certain age, viz. twenty-five or thirty, or, accord|ing to other writers, when they are capable of making u&s;e of women, are in&s;erted on each &s;ide the virile member, between the &s;kin and the fle&s;h, which is opened for that purpo&s;e, and healed in &s;even or eight days. The Peguers may be rank|ed among the mo&s;t &s;uper&s;titious of all man|kind. They maintain and wor&s;hip crocodiles, and will drink nothing but the waters of the ditches where tho&s;e mon&s;trous animals harbour. By thus expo&s;ing them&s;elves to the manife&s;t hazard of their lives, they have frequently the misfortune to be de|voured. They have five principal fe&s;tivals in the year, called &s;apans, which they celebrate with ex|traordinary magnificence. In one of them the king and queen make a pilgrimage about twelve leagues from the city, riding on a triumphal car, &s;o richly adorned with jewels, that it may be &s;aid, without an hyperbole, that they carry about them the value of a kingdom. This prince is extremely rich, and has, in the chapel of his palace, idols of ine&s;timable value, &s;ome of them being of ma&s;&s;y gold and &s;ilver, and adorned with all &s;orts of pre|cious &s;tones. The talapoins, or prie&s;ts of this country, have no po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; but &s;uch is the re|&s;pect paid them by the people, that they are never
<PB N="98" REF="980">
known to want. They preach to them every Monday, not to commit murder, to take from no per&s;on any thing belonging to him, to do no hurt, to give no oflence, to avoid impurity and &s;uper|&s;tition, but, above all, not to wor&s;hip the devil; but the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es have no effect in the la&s;t re&s;pect. The people, attached to manichei&s;m, believe, that all good comes from God, and that the devil is the author of all the evil that happens to men; and that therefore they ought to wor&s;hip him, that he may not afflict them. This is a common notion a|mong the Indian idolaters.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Pegu are accu&s;ed by &s;ome authors, with being &s;lovenly in their hou&s;es, and na&s;ty in their diet, on account of their &s;ea&s;oning their victuals with &s;idol, a compo&s;ition made of &s;tinking fi&s;h, reduced to a con&s;i&s;tency like mu&s;tard, &s;o nau&s;eous and offen&s;ive, that none but them&s;elves can endure the &s;mell of it. Balbi &s;ays, he could &s;ooner bear the &s;cent of &s;tinking carrion; and yet with this they &s;ea&s;on their rice, and other &s;oops, in&s;tead of oil or butter. As they have no wheat in the country, their bread is rice, made into cakes. Their common drink is water, or a liquor di&s;tilled from cocoa-nut water.</P>
<P>The men here, as in mo&s;t ea&s;tern countries, buy their wives, or pay their parents a dowry for them. They have an odd cu&s;tom, which is to offer their daughters to &s;trangers, and hire them out for a time: &s;ome &s;ay they hire out their wives in the &s;ame manner. The&s;e marriages for a term are well regulated, and often prove very beneficial to the occa&s;ional hu&s;band. Mo&s;t of the foreigners who trade hither, marry a wife for the time of their &s;tay. In ca&s;e of a &s;eperation, the father is obliged to take care of the boys, and the mother of the girls. We are told, that no woman is looked up|on the wor&s;e, but rather the better, for having had
<PB N="99" REF="990">
&s;everal European hu&s;bands: nay, we are told, that no per&s;on of fa&s;hion in Pegu, from the gentleman to the king, will marry a maiden, till &s;ome ac|quaintance, or &s;tranger, has had the fir&s;t night's lodging with her.</P>
<P>In Pegu, the inheritance of all land is in the king: he is likewi&s;e the heir of all his &s;ubjects who die without i&s;&s;ue; but in ca&s;e they have chil|dren, two-thirds go to them, and the re&s;t to his maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>When a per&s;on falls &s;ick, we are told, that they generally make a vow to the devil, from whom they believe all evil comes. Then a &s;caffold is built, and victuals &s;pread on the top of it, to &s;o|lace Old Nic, and render him propitious. This fea&s;t is accompanied with lighted candles and mu&s;ic, and the whole is managed by an undertaker, called the devil's father.</P>
<P>The commodities exported from this country, are gold, &s;ilver, rubies, mu&s;k, benjamin, long|pepper, tin, lead, copper, lakka, or gum - lac, whereof they make hard wax, rice, rice-wine, and &s;ome &s;ugar-canes, of which they would have plenty, but that the elephants eat them. It may be ob&s;erved, that under the name of rubies, the Peguers comprize topazes, &s;apphires, amethy&s;ts, and other &s;tones, which they di&s;tingui&s;h by &s;aying the blue, the violet, and the yellow rubies. The true ruby is red, tran&s;parent, or &s;parkling, in|clining, near the &s;urface, to the violet of the ame|thy&s;t. Cotton cloths from Bengal, and Coro|mandel, with &s;ome &s;triped &s;ilks, are be&s;t for the Pegu market, and &s;ilver of any &s;ort will go off there; for the king, in return for his eight and a half per cent. duty on it, allows the merchants to melt it down, and put what copper alloy they plea&s;e in it. They wear none of our European commodities in Pegu, but hats and ribbons. The
<PB N="100" REF="1000">
gentry will give extravagant prices for fine beaver hats, which they wear without any cocks. They are no le&s;s fond of ribbons, flowered with gold and &s;ilver, which they wear round their hats.</P>
<P>As to the religion of the Peguers, it is the &s;ame at bottom with that which prevails over the re&s;t of India and Tibet, only varies in dre&s;s &s;omewhat in different countries, according to the humour or intere&s;t of the prie&s;ts. They hold the exi&s;tence of one &s;upreme God, of whom they make no image; but they have many inferior created gods, who&s;e images are &s;et up in their temples for the laity to wor&s;hip. Not content with the&s;e, we are told they wor&s;hip the devil al&s;o. Many are &s;een to run about the &s;treets every morning, with rice in one hand, and a torch in the other, crying aloud, that they are going to give the devil his breakfa&s;t, that he may not hurt them all the day. Be&s;ides the manichean doctrine of two principles, one the author of good, and the other of evil, from whence their wor&s;hipping the devil has its ri&s;e, they be|lieve an eternal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of worlds, without crea|tion. The Peguers hold the doctrine of the Me|temp&s;ycho&s;is, or tran&s;migration of the human &s;oul, which, after pa&s;&s;ing through the bodies of various animals, &s;hall attain to the perfection and felicity of their gods, which, in effect, is no other than a &s;tate of annihilation. They have a &s;trong opinion of the &s;anctity of apes and crocodiles, in&s;omuch that they believe the per&s;ons to be perfectly happy that are devoured by them. Their temples are of a conic form, and &s;ome of them a quarter of a mile round. They ob&s;erve a great many fe&s;|tivals, &s;ome of which are called &s;apan. The images of their inferior gods are in a &s;itting po&s;ture, with their legs acro&s;s, and toes of equal length: their arms and hands very &s;mall in proportion to their bodies: their faces longer than human: their ears
<PB N="101" REF="1010">
long, and the lappets very thick. The congre|gation bow to them, when they come in and when they go out; and that is all the wor&s;hip which they pay to them. The prie&s;ts of Pegu, called talapoins, are a &s;ort of mendicant friars. They ob&s;erve cele|bacy, and eat but once a day, living in the woods, in a &s;ort of ne&s;ts, or cages, built on the tops of trees, for fear of the tygers. They preach fre|quently, lead very innocent lives, and are very ho&s;pitable and humane.</P>
<P>The king of Pegu's revenues ari&s;e chiefly from the rent of lands, of which he is the &s;ole proprie|tor. Another branch of it are the duties paid for commodities imported or exported. In a word, he is judged to be the riche&s;t monarch in the world, next to the emperor of China.</P>
<P>The monarchs of Pegu, by the report of mo&s;t authors, have brought into the field armies a|mounting to a million, and a million and a half of men; for the maintainance of whom, in time of peace, he a&s;&s;igns lands and towns to his nobles; but, in time of war, he finds them him&s;elf in pay, cloaths, and arms, the la&s;t of which are lances, mu&s;kets, &s;words, and targets. Their mu&s;kets are as good as the European, but the other arms very indifferent. They have plenty of all &s;orts of artillery, but no &s;kilful gunners: they likewi&s;e want &s;hip-carpenters and &s;ailors, and this is the rea&s;on why they had no naval force, except plea&s;ure barges, &s;ome of which are exceeding beautiful, being exqui&s;itely carved, and gilded all over. The king of Pegu is &s;aid to have no fewer than eight hundred elephants, trained to war, with ca&s;tles on their backs, each holding four &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>Pegu is divided into &s;everal petty kingdoms and provinces, in which are many con&s;iderable towns. The capital from which the kingdom takes its name, &s;tands on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the river of Pegu,
<PB N="102" REF="1020">
about thirty miles from its mouth. Before it was ruined, in the year 1600, it was one of the mo&s;t &s;plendid, large, and populous cities in all A&s;ia; but now, though &s;ix or &s;even leagues in compa&s;s, not one-twentieth part is inhabited, and that only by the lower cla&s;s of people: however, it is &s;till the &s;eat of the viceroy, who governs for the king, re|&s;iding now at Ava.</P>
<P>The other towns of mo&s;t note are, Sirian, Ko&s;|min, Tavay, Koylan, Medun, Dala, Leungon, Dogun, China Bakkar, Satan, or Zatan.</P>
<P>Sirian, which is the only port now open for trade in all the country, &s;tands on the we&s;t &s;ide of the river of Pegu, towards its mouth. This port is frequented by &s;hips from &s;everal parts of India, and by &s;ome Engli&s;h, Portugue&s;e, and Armenians; the la&s;t of whom have monopolized the ruby trade. The harbour is capable of receiving ve&s;&s;els of &s;ix hundred tons. Goods de&s;tined for Pegu are com|monly landed at Sirian, and conveyed by an inland channel to a place called Makkao, where they are again put on &s;hore, and carried by land to Pegu, which is twelve miles di&s;tant.</P>
<P>On the return of the tide of flood, the &s;ea runs with &s;uch violence and &s;wiftne&s;s into the bay and river of Pegu, that no &s;hip can with&s;tand its force, but in a moment is overturned. This furious tide, which the natives called Makkrea, or Makkareo, and al&s;o the Great Bore or Boer, advances with &s;uch a roaring, that the noi&s;e may be heard ten miles off. We are told, that the tide in the Gulph of Kam|baya is nothing compared with this, and that it runs as &s;wift as an arrow out of a bow.</P>
<P>Along the coa&s;ts of Pegu lie many i&s;lands, a|mong which are the Cocos, the Perperies, and tho&s;e called Negrais, which give name to a river, cape, and port, at the extremity of Pegu north|wards.</P>

<HEAD>The KINGDOM of AVA</HEAD>
<P>Of this kingdom, which forms another part of that called the empire of Ava, from the king or emperor's re&s;iding at the capital of that name, our accounts are very imperfect, the inland country of this penin&s;ula having been very little frequented by Europeans. Ava, as a particular kingdom, is &s;aid to be inclo&s;ed by Jangoma, or Siam, on the ea&s;t; Pegu on the &s;outh; and Arrakan on the we&s;t; but what country lies to the north of it, we are not informed by travellers. With regard to the ex|tent of the empire of Ava, which includes the king|dom of Ava, with its conque&s;ts, the mi&s;&s;ionary Du Chatz tells us, that it is twice as big as France, being bounded on the we&s;t partly by the Gulph of Bengal, and partly by the kingdoms of Arrakan and A&s;&s;am, from which la&s;t it &s;eems to be &s;epa|rated by the great river of Arrakan; on the north by mountains, dividing it from Tibet and China; on the ea&s;t by the country of Laos; and on the &s;outh by the kingdom of Siam, and the Gulph of Bengal. As it lies between the 15th and 26th degrees of latitude, and between 109th and 118th degrees of longitude, its length, from &s;outh to north, is about &s;even hundred and &s;ixty-five Eng|li&s;h miles; and its breadth, from we&s;t to ea&s;t, five hundred and &s;eventy-five; but captain Hamilton makes it about eight hundred miles long from north to &s;outh, and two hundred and fifty broad from ea&s;t to we&s;t. The kingdom of Ava, properly &s;o called, is &s;aid to be, in general, a flat country, e&s;pecially near the great river, and very fertile, producing rice, fruits, and a variety of animals, wild and tame. It has al&s;o mines of Cyprian bra&s;s, lead, and &s;ilver. Mu&s;k and rubies likewi&s;e come from thence to Pegu. As to the conquered coun|tries
<PB N="104" REF="1040">
lying to the north and ea&s;t, excepting that of Jangoma, we know little concerning them in any re&s;pect, not &s;o much as their names. A very large river, called in the Je&s;uits map Lukyang, but, at the city of Ava, Menan Kiow, ri&s;ing in the country of Tibet, and pa&s;&s;ing through the province of Yun-nan in China, and the kingdom of Ava, joins that of Pegu, near three hundred miles &s;outh of the city of Ava, near Sirian, below which, at ten leagues di&s;tance, it falls into the &s;ea.</P>
<P>In this country it is &s;aid, a creditor may &s;eize and &s;ell both debtor and his family, if they have no|thing el&s;e wherewithal to di&s;charge the debt. Some|times we are told the Peguers, when they want money, will pledge not only them&s;elves, but their wives and children, to obtain it. If payment is not made at the time limited, the creditor may then &s;ieze them all, and lock them up in his ware|hou&s;e. They are then &s;o much at his di&s;po&s;al, that he may even lie with the in&s;olvent's wife, if he has a mind; but then, by that action, the debt is under&s;tood to be quite di&s;charged. For di&s;|covering murder, theft, or perjury, al&s;o to find the truth where the evidence is doubtful or con|tradictory, the ordeal is much u&s;ed in Pegu and Ava. Of this there are &s;everal kinds: one way is to make the parties chew &s;ome raw rice, and &s;wal|low it; but they &s;ay the guilty cannot get it down, and thus &s;tands convicted. Another method is, to oblige the accu&s;er and the accu&s;ed, to lay hold of a &s;take driven into a river, and he who &s;tays longe&s;t under water is judged mo&s;t de&s;erving of credit. The guilty per&s;on, that is, he who was &s;o unlucky as to have the &s;horte&s;t breath, mu&s;t lie on his back for three days and nights, with his neck in the &s;tocks or pillory, without meat or drink, and is fined to boot.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="1050">
The king, or emperor of Ava, gives great at|tention to public affairs. When his breakfa&s;t is over, which con&s;i&s;ts of rice boiled in water, and reli&s;hed with prok, i. e. a mixture of &s;hrimps, dried and powdered with &s;alt and cod-pepper which makes a very pungent &s;auce, in great e&s;teem, he re|tires to hear the petitions of his &s;ubjects; by whom, if they may be called &s;o, he is approached with the mo&s;t abject reverence. The highe&s;t title which any of them a&s;&s;umes, is to call him&s;elf his maje&s;ty's fir&s;t &s;lave: when they &s;peak or write to him, they call him their kiak, or god; and the king him&s;elf, in his letters to foreign princes, a&s;&s;umes the title of "King of kings, to whom all other kings ought to be &s;ubject, as being near kin&s;man and friend to all the gods in heaven and on earth; that by their friend&s;hip to him, all animals are fed and pre&s;erved, and all the &s;ea&s;ons of the year have their con&s;tant returns: that the &s;un is his brother, the moon and &s;tars his next relations: that he is lord over the ebbing and flowing of the &s;ea: la&s;tly, that he is king of the white elephant, and twenty-four um|brellas."</P>
<P>The quality of an officer is known here by his tobacco-pipe. This uten&s;il con&s;i&s;ts of three parts, a head or bowl, a &s;hape or &s;hank, and a mouth|piece. The head is either of metal or clay, with a &s;ocket to let in the &s;haft, which is made of a joint|ed reed or cane; the mouth-piece is of gold, fixed on the upper end of the &s;haft, and, like the reed, has joints, who&s;e number a&s;certains the degree of the officer, and he is re&s;pected according to that token. As to other particulars, what we &s;aid of Pegu will &s;erve likewi&s;e for Ava, the religion, laws, and cu&s;toms, being nearly the &s;ame in both countries.</P>
<P>The principal cities in the kingdom are &s;aid to be Ava, Bakan, Chaleu, and Prom. The fir&s;t,

which &s;tands on the river Menan Kiow, above three hundred leagues from its mouth, gives name to the kingdom, and is about as large as Rheims in France. The emperor re&s;ides here in a very large palace, built of &s;tone, and gilded both with|in and without.

<P>This kingdom, which is al&s;o included in the empire of Ava, is &s;aid to be bounded to the &s;outh by Siam, to the ea&s;t by the territories of the Laos, and to the we&s;t by the kingdom of Ava Proper; but what are its boundaries to the north, or its ex|tent, we are not told: we may, however, conclude it to be very large, if what we are told of the num|ber of forces the king can rai&s;e be true; namely, ordinarily three hundred and fifty thou&s;and, and, upon occa&s;ion, a million.</P>
<P>In all the countries of this part of the world they wear no &s;hoes; and here they go both with their head and feet bare. Some &s;ay, they wear bells in their privy members, like the people of Pegu and Ava. When any per&s;on falls &s;ick, they make a vow to of|fer meat to the devil, in ca&s;e they recover. During their illne&s;s, a talepoy or two &s;it by them every night, and &s;ing, with a view to &s;ooth the devil, that he may do them no hurt. They burn their dead here. Pimenta &s;ays, Jangoma abounds with mu&s;k, pep|per, &s;ilk, &s;ilver, gold, copper, and benjamin.</P>

<HEAD>The KINGDOM of LAWHOS or LAOS.</HEAD>
<P>The country of Lawhos, Lao, or of the Laos, of which Jangoma was originally, or by conque&s;t, a part, taken in its large&s;t &s;en&s;e, is bounded on the
<PB N="107" REF="1070">
we&s;t by the dominions of Ava; on the north by the province of Yun-nan or Junnan, in China; on the ea&s;t by Tonquin; and on the &s;outh by Kam|bodia. The territories of Laos, taken altogether, may extend in length from &s;outh to north about four hundred and eighty-three Engli&s;h miles, and in breadth from we&s;t to ea&s;t two hundred and three; being &s;ituated between the 15th or 16th, and the 22d degrees of north latitude, and between the 119th and 122d degrees of ea&s;t longitude; altho' &s;ome &s;ome geographers make it &s;carce half &s;o much. It is &s;urrounded on all &s;ides by mountains, fore&s;ts, and de&s;erts. The country of Lao &s;eems to be for the general flat, and to have &s;carce any hills or mountains but tho&s;e which encompa&s;s it on all &s;ides, and &s;erve as barriers again&s;t the potent king|doms with which it is inclo&s;ed. From the&s;e moun|tains de&s;cend infinite rivulets, which di&s;charge them&s;elves into one large river, called, in Lao, Menan Kong, which, ri&s;ing in the north-we&s;t bor|ders of the province of Yun-nan, in China, cro&s;&s;es the whole region from north to &s;outh, and falls into the &s;ea at Bon&s;ak. As &s;oon as this river enters Kamboja, its waters &s;eem to change their qualities, &s;o that the fi&s;h which pa&s;s the frontiers die imme|diately: in like manner, &s;uch as a&s;cend the &s;tream from Kamboja, into Lao, feel the &s;ame effect; which &s;urprizing circum&s;tance has given ri&s;e to the proverb, "Each in his own kingdom."</P>
<P>This country is divided into two parts, the northern and &s;outhern; the fir&s;t being Lao, pro|perly &s;o called, and the other the kingdom of Lan|jang.</P>
<P>The climate of the kingdom of Lanjang is more temperate, and far more healthful, than that of Tonquin or Tong-king. The &s;oil is generally very good, being rendered fruitful by a great number of canals, cut from the great river Menan Kong. It is remarkable, that the lands on the ea&s;tern &s;ide
<PB N="108" REF="1080">
of the river are va&s;tly better, and more fertile, than tho&s;e on the we&s;tern &s;ide: the very animals, &s;uch as elephants and rhinocero&s;&s;es, are larger: the rice too is incomparable, and of a particular &s;cent as well as flavour: the fore&s;t and other trees are high, &s;trait, and, for the general, incorruptible; qualities wanting in tho&s;e on the we&s;tern &s;ide, where they are ill-&s;haped, and the rice &s;o hard, that it is &s;carce fit for boiling. As &s;oon as the rains begin to cea&s;e, certain &s;outherly winds blow, and the lands which had been &s;own with rice immediately after the har|ve&s;t, produce a kind of &s;cum, which covering the face of the country, like &s;now, for &s;everal miles, is hardened with the &s;un, and becomes a &s;olid &s;alt. There is &s;o great a quantity of it produced in this manner, that not only the whole kingdom is &s;upplied with it, at a very trifling expence, but enough is left to &s;erve &s;trangers, who come every year, and carry away as much as they think fit. There is no coun|try where more ivory is to be had; elephants being &s;o numerous in it, that the inhabitants are &s;aid to have taken their name from them. Oxen and buf|faloes al&s;o, with many other kinds of animals, are very common. The gum, called benjamin or bonjoin, which di&s;tills from a tree growing in the mountains, is reckoned the be&s;t in the Ea&s;t, and is found in great abundance; as is al&s;o lacea, which is u&s;ed in making Spani&s;h wax, and is nothing but a certain kind of earth, found in fore&s;ts about the ant-hills: but the rhinoceros's horn is the thing mo&s;t prized by the natives, from a belief, that who|ever is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of one, may command good for|tune. As the fore&s;ts are of great extent, and the plains enamelled with a variety of flowers, they make abundance of honey, wax, and cotton, One meets al&s;o with &s;everal mines of iron, lead, and tin, which are wrought. Gold and &s;ilver al&s;o are found here; but the inhabitants gather tho&s;e metals out
<PB N="109" REF="1090">
of certain places of the river, by means of iron nets. From the neighbouring countries they have red amber and mu&s;k, with which they drive a great trade: the former is found at the roots of certain very old trees, and the latter in a bag joining to the no&s;e of an animal, which the Chine&s;e call ye-hyang or the mu&s;k-&s;tag. The rivers of this country a|bound with fi&s;h of &s;everal kinds, &s;ome of them &s;o large and heavy that two men can hardly carry one of them. The &s;maller &s;orts are caught in &s;uch plenty, that an hundred weight may be had for the value of five-pence. According to Kaempfer, Lao produces pearls and precious &s;tones, e&s;pecially ru|bies.</P>
<P>The northern Lao, with re&s;pect to &s;oil and pro|duce, is much of the &s;ame nature as the &s;outhern, or the kingdom of Lanjang. In this country they have the u&s;e of fire-arms, great and &s;mall cannon, mu&s;kets, zagays or darts, and cro&s;s-bows. The principal commodities are precious &s;tones, gold, &s;il|ver, tin, lead, copper, &s;ulphur, (both red and com|mon) cotton, (&s;pun and un&s;pun) tea, lack, Japan or Brazil wood, &s;ilks, camblets, carpets, blue and black callico, mu&s;k, quick&s;ilver, kori-&s;hells, china|ware, and a medicinal root, called tong-quey by the Chine&s;e. The inhabitants are great believers in witchcraft and magic. Some great men have a no|tion, that if the head of their elephant be rubbed with wine, in which a drop or two of human gall hath been put, the bea&s;t will become more robu&s;t, and them|&s;elves more couragious; &s;o that ever after they may a&s;&s;ure them&s;elves of victory, either in war or on any other occa&s;ion. From this ridiculous conceit, the go|vernors &s;ometimes, tho' but rarely, employ de&s;perate fellows, who, for twenty-five or thirty crowns, will go into the fore&s;ts to hunt men, and of the fir&s;t they meet with of either &s;ex, young or old, prie&s;t or layman, open the belly and &s;tomach, while alive,
<PB N="110" REF="1100">
and taking out the gall bladder, cut off his head, to convince the more &s;avage purcha&s;er that he has not deceived him. In ca&s;e the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in does not perform his engagement in the limited time, he is obliged to kill either him&s;elf, his wife, or a child, that his employer may take the gall out of the unhappy victim. They make four meals a day, and roa&s;t their fowls, which they have in great plenty, with all their feathers on, notwith|&s;tanding the in&s;ufferable &s;tink ari&s;ing from that kind of cookery. Much cannot be &s;aid in prai&s;e of their cleanline&s;s; for they hang up the ve&s;&s;els they keep their water in, and even tho&s;e they drink out of, in their &s;moaky chimnies. Some travellers tell us, their bodies are adorned with blue figures, made with hot irons, down to the knees: others, that they paint their legs, from the ancle to the knee, with flowers and branches of trees, like the Siame&s;e. Fornication is tolerated here, among the laity; but a woman convicted of adultery becomes a &s;lave to her hu&s;band, who beats her in what manner he thinks fit. When a woman is brought to bed, all the family and relations meet, and divert them&s;elves for a month, with dancing and other kinds of merriment, in order to drive away the &s;orcerers, and prevent them from making the mother lo&s;e her milk, and the child from being bewitched. When any of their relations die, they make a fea&s;t al&s;o, which holds for a month, and celebrate their funeral with great magnificence: when the month is expired, they rai&s;e a curious py|ramid, which, after they have depo&s;ited the corp&s;e therein, they &s;et fire to, and reduce to a&s;hes. The language of the Laos, as well as their characters, are much the &s;ame with tho&s;e of the Siame&s;e, who, they &s;ay, had the art of writing, and their &s;acred language, from them; but they cannot pronounce the letters l and r. They write on the leaves of trees, like the Peguers and Malab&acirc;rs, and in the
<PB N="111" REF="1110">
manner which the Siame&s;e write their religious books; but matters relating to civil affairs are in|&s;cribed on a &s;ort of coar&s;e paper, with earthen pens.</P>
<P>The religion of the Laos is the &s;ame at bottom with that which prevails in all the countries com|pri&s;ed in the Farther Penin&s;ula of the Ganges. The Indians, that is the original inhabitants of all the countries ea&s;tward of Per&s;ia, as far as the Ori|ental Ocean, &s;eem to be divided between two reli|gions, each of which are of very great extent: for di&s;tinctions &s;ake, we &s;hall call one that of the br&acirc;|mins, and the other that of the lamas. That of the bramins prevails over Hind&ucirc;&s;tan, and the Hi|ther Penin&s;ula, where, although the moguls are become almo&s;t wholly ma&s;ters, yet it is computed, that in Hind&ucirc;&s;tan it&s;elf there are at lea&s;t an hun|dred idolaters, or image-wor&s;hippers, to one Mo|hammedan; con&s;equently, their number mu&s;t be much greater in the penin&s;ula, &s;everal countries of which are yet entirely under the dominion of the rajahs. On the other hand, the religion of the la|mas is the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of Tibet, of all that part of Great Tartary called We&s;tern Tartary, of the whole farther penin&s;ula of India, and of Japan. It has likewi&s;e &s;pread over mo&s;t of the Oriental i&s;lands; and although it be not the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of China, yet it &s;eems to be embraced by much the greater part of its inhabitants: &s;o that the religion of the lamas may be &s;aid to extend over three or four times as much ground as that of the br&acirc;mins. The&s;e two religions, though agreeing in the moral precepts, the doctrine of the &s;oul's tran&s;migration, and the wor&s;hip of images, yet differ in &s;everal e&s;|&s;ential points; as the di&s;tinction of people into tribes, eating of fle&s;h, frequent wa&s;hings, and the like, but e&s;pecially in the article relating to the Su|preme Being; for the lamas hold, that God him&s;elf a&s;&s;umed fle&s;h, and actually dwelt among them in a
<PB N="112" REF="1120">
human &s;hape, being known in this penin&s;ula by the name of Thikka, Sommona, Kodom, and Shaka; in the Hither by that of Budda; in China by that of Fo, or She-kya; and in Tibet, whence it had its original, by that of La, Lama-Konju or Kon|chock, i. e. the Eternal Father, and Delay-Lama, or the Grand Lama; whereas the three incar|nated deities of the br&acirc;mins are inferior, and crea|ted beings: not but the &s;ects which hold We&s;tn&ucirc;, or I&s;huren, to be the Supreme God, &s;eem, in this point, to differ out little from the Lamas.</P>
<P>The country of the Laos is &s;aid to be divided into &s;everal petty kingdoms, all &s;ubordinate to one $Span$ head or monarch. One thing remarkable $Span$ laws is, that if the chief of a family is con|$Span$ any great crime, all who belong to him, $$ the different degrees of con&s;anguinity, are de|graded, and deprived of their offices, rights, and privileges; and for the future are employed in no|thing but the &s;ervice of the elephants, as gathering gra&s;s for them, carrying it to the king's &s;tables, and watching them all night.</P>
<P>The principal cities of the Laos are &s;aid to be Leng, the capital, Jamakay or Chiamay, Kyang|hay, Kyang-Seng, Meng, Kemerat, Le Kyang|kong, and Lanjang. At the la&s;t of the&s;e, &s;tanding in the latitude of 18&deg;, we are told, the king u&s;ually re&s;ides, in a palace of &s;o va&s;t extent, that it may well pa&s;s for a city, both with re&s;pect to its magni|tude, and the number of people who inhabit it.</P>

<HEAD>The KINGDOM of SIAM.</HEAD>
<P>Siam is &s;urrounded by high mountains, which on the ea&s;t &s;ide &s;eparate it from the kingdoms of Camboja or Cambodia, and Lahos or Laos; on the we&s;t from Pegu; and on the north from Ava, or, more properly, from Jangoma, which is &s;ubject
<PB N="113" REF="1130">
to Ava; on the &s;outh it is wa&s;hed by the gulph of Siam; and, in part, al&s;o bounded by the penin&s;ula of Malacca, the north part whereof is under its dominion. It is &s;aid to be &s;ituated between the 7th and 19th degrees of latitude, containing 12&deg;. or about eight hundred and thirty-four Engli&s;h miles, in length, from north to &s;outh; and between the 115th and 121&s;t degrees of longitude: &s;o that its greate&s;t breadth, from we&s;t to ea&s;t, is about four hundred miles; but, towards the north, it is not much above half that breadth.</P>
<P>Siam being, as hath been already ob&s;erved, &s;ur|rounded with mountains, and having very few hills within the country, may be &s;aid to be one wide ex|tended plain, with a great river, and its branches, running through it, from &s;outh to north. It is re|markable, that the&s;e mountains, which make two huge chains, one on the we&s;t, and the other on the ea&s;t &s;ide, dimini&s;h gradually, as they advance &s;outh|ward. That on the we&s;t &s;ide, having pa&s;&s;ed along the borders of Pegu, runs through the middle of the penin&s;ula of Malacca, and terminates at the cape of Sincap&ucirc;ra, the mo&s;t &s;outhern point of all A&s;ia, which &s;eparates the Gulph or Bay of Bengal from that of Siam. The ea&s;tern chain, which divides Siam from Laos and Cambodia, terminates at the cape of this la&s;t name, which makes the mo&s;t ea&s;tern point of the gulph of Siam. The kingdom of Siam extends on each &s;ide of the gulph, like a hor&s;e-&s;hoe, beginning on the ea&s;t &s;ide, at the river of Chantabon, which divides it from Cambodia. On the oppo&s;ite &s;ide it reaches as far &s;outh as Que|dah and Pat&acirc;na, in the territories of the Malayans, of which Malacca was formerly the capital. Thus the coa&s;t runs about two hundred leagues along the gulph of Siam, and an hundred and eighty along that of Bengal, affording great conveniency for trade to the kingdom. The principal river of Siam
<PB N="114" REF="1140">
is called Men&acirc;m, Men&acirc;n, or Meyn&acirc;m, that is, the Mother of Waters, by way of excellency; Me|n&acirc;m being an appellation given to all great rivers through the Farther Penin&s;ula. Its cour&s;e is from north to &s;outh, thro' the whole country of Siam. As it approaches the capital, it becomes very large, and at la&s;t falls into the Gulph of Siam, by three mouths, the mo&s;t navigable of which is that towards the ea&s;t. Its waters annually overflow in March, at which time the country is drowned for above an hundred and twenty miles in circuit. To this pe|riodical event the kingdom not only owes its ferti|lity, but has &s;ometimes been obliged for its pre|&s;ervation. Great &s;hips might &s;ail up it as far as Siam, was it not for a bank or bar at the mouth, which has but eleven or twelve feet water in the highe&s;t floods. Among the fi&s;h in it, be&s;ides &s;ome mon&s;trous crocodiles, is a &s;mall one that is vene|mous, and, on being provoked, &s;wells like a toad.</P>
<P>The country of Siam may be divided into cul|tivated and uncultivated lands, of which latter it for the mo&s;t part con&s;i&s;ts; being covered with woods of bamb&ucirc;, and a variety of other trees, of which the mo&s;t profitable are tho&s;e that produce cotton, oil, and varni&s;h; that called wood-mary, which is better than any other for the ribs of &s;hips; iron-wood, very heavy and tough, of which an|chors are made, and which is &s;aid to have the qua|lity of corroding iron in time; the cinnamon-tree, &s;apan, and other woods, for dying; the aquila and aloes wood, &amp;c. The oils extracted from the trees, mixed with plai&s;ter, render the walls of the Siame&s;e hou&s;es as white, hard, and give them as fine a poli&s;h, as marble. In Siam are found al&s;o mines of gold, copper, tin, lead, &s;teel, iron, cry&s;tal, antimony, emeril, and other minerals, be&s;ides a quarry of white marble. There are likewi&s;e mountains of load-&s;tone; and others affording agates, &s;apphires,
<PB N="115" REF="1150">
and diamonds. The mo&s;t fruitful lands here are made &s;o by the earth that is wa&s;hed down from the mountains, and the mud and &s;lime the inundations leave behind them when they retire. To avoid the&s;e floods, the ants always make their ne&s;ts in trees; and the partridges and pigeons, which do not perch in other countries, in&s;tructed by nature, do all perch in this. Among the in&s;ects are white ants, little &s;hining flies, and the palmer worm, which carries a &s;ting both in its head and tail. The &s;ummer here is rainy; but the winter dry, and as hot as our warme&s;t &s;ummer. The winds called the mon&s;oons, blow one half of the year from the north, and the other from the &s;outh: during the former &s;hips can hardly get to the bar of Siam, nor depart from it during the latter.</P>
<P>The Siame&s;e have no word to expre&s;s week; but, like us, they call the &s;even days after the planets. They begin their year on the fir&s;t day of the moon in November or December, according to certain rules; their months, which are twelve, con&s;i&s;ting each of thirty days, are di&s;tingui&s;hed by numbers, and not names. They have &s;ome Turky wheat; but their principal and chief food is rice. They have al&s;o pota|toes, with pea&s;e, and other legumes, but different from ours, be&s;ides plenty of a&s;paragus and &s;iboules; but no onions, nor garlick, cucumbers, &s;itruls, water|melons, par&s;ley, baum, &s;orrel, celery, cauliflowers, coleworts, turnips, par&s;nips, carrots, leeks, or let|tice; nor any true melons, &s;trawberries, ra&s;pber|ries, or artichoaks. Mo&s;t of our flowers al&s;o and plants, except turbero&s;es, gilly flowers, amaranthu&s;es, tricolors, ro&s;es, and je&s;&s;amines, are unknown in Siam. Oxen and buffaloes, elephants, rhinoce|ro&s;es, tygers, &s;corpions, and &s;erpents, abound here, as in mo&s;t of the other countries of India. Ele|phants are one of the greate&s;t curio&s;ities of this pe|nin&s;ula. The&s;e animals do not come to their full
<PB N="116" REF="1160">
growth until they are an hundred years old, and live &s;everal hundred years after; being certainly the mo&s;t &s;agacious and tractable animals in nature. There is a white elephant here that is almo&s;t adored, there not being another of the colour: they be|lieve this elephant is animated by the &s;oul of &s;ome great prince; and for that rea&s;on the king never rides upon him, and he is &s;erved in plate, and treated as a monarch. Next to the white elephants, the black are mo&s;t in e&s;teem.</P>
<P>As the Si me&s;e have no clocks or watches but what are brought from Europe, they make u&s;e of a hollow copper ball, with a little hole in it, which being put on the top of a tub of water, lets in the water by degrees, and &s;inks when the hour is out: this &s;erves them in&s;tead of an hour-gla&s;s; and, as they have no clocks, they give notice of the hour by &s;triking, with a hammer, on a great brazen ve&s;&s;el. They u&s;e wooden anchors to their gallies here, and have neither chi&s;&s;els, &s;aws, nor nails, nor even pins or needles; for in building they u&s;e only pins made of bamb&ucirc; They have &s;ome iron and copper padlocks, but both &s;orts brought from Japan; for they make none them&s;elves. In Siam there are no particular handicraft-trades; but every man under&s;tands &s;omething of all they have occa|&s;ion for.</P>
<P>The Siame&s;e have a ready and clear conception, and their repartees are quick and &s;mart: they imi|tate any thing at &s;ight, and, in one day, become to|lerable workmen. The people are polite and courteous, but timorous: they have but little cu|rio&s;ity or inclination to alter their fa&s;hions, and do not admire the curio&s;ities of foreign countries, as we do. Tho&s;e who have the education of youth, teach them to expre&s;s all the mode&s;ty and &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion imaginable towards their &s;uperiors. Their ru|ral &s;ports are fi&s;hing and hunting. They act co|medies
<PB N="117" REF="1170">
by torch-light, from evening till morning; and they chew the arak-nut, and the betel-leaf, which is a kind of opiate, perpetually. They cele|brate the fe&s;tival of the new-year, for ten or twelve days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, when there is a ce&s;&s;ation of all manner of bu&s;ine&s;s; and &s;pend their time in drink|ing and gaming. The fir&s;t and fifteenth of every moon al&s;o are holidays; and their great men &s;o|lemnize their birth-days annually, when they are complimented by their relations. They puni&s;h lying here as &s;everely as we do perjury. Here too we meet with trials by fire and water-ordeal, like tho&s;e of our Saxon ance&s;tors, where &s;ufficient proof is wanting in a criminal pro&s;ecution. Another kind of proof is by &s;wallowing pills, which the prie&s;t admini&s;ters to both parties, with terrible im|precations; and the party which keeps them in his &s;tomach without vomiting, is adjudged innocent. An unju&s;t intruder and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of lands is deemed as criminal in this country as a robber, and puni&s;h|ed as &s;everely. The Siame&s;e burn their dead.</P>
<P>With regard to religion, every Siame&s;e temple has its convent of frairs annexed to it, and they have a proportionable number of nunneries. Be|&s;ides the images in their temples, whereof the ele|phant and the hor&s;e are the chief, they wor&s;hip every thing almo&s;t, animate and inanimate, bea&s;ts, birds, fi&s;hes, woods, mountains, rivers, &amp;c. and, in general, believe the doctrine of tran&s;migration, that their &s;ouls enter into &s;ome animal when they die, and, after having undergone &s;everal forms, ar|rive at length at the regions of bli&s;s, and enjoy an eternal re&s;t.</P>
<P>The Siame&s;e are of a good &s;tature, &s;eldom cor|pulent, of a tawny or olive complexion, and not any of them black, as in the Hither Penin&s;ula, tho' they lie nearer the equator; from whence it is evi|dent, that it is not the &s;un alone which is the occa|&s;ion
<PB N="118" REF="1180">
of the black complexion. The faces of both men and women are &s;omewhat of the broade&s;t, with high cheek bones; and their foreheads &s;ud|denly contract and terminate in a point, as well as their chins. They have dark &s;mall eyes, not very bri&s;k; their jaws hollow, large mouths, and thick pale lips, and their teeth dyed black; their no&s;es are &s;hort, and round at the end, and their ears large, which they account a beauty: long nails, growing an inch or two beyond their finger ends, are looked upon al&s;o as ornaments. They have thick lank hair, which both men and women cut &s;o &s;hort, that it reaches no lower than their ears; and the women make it &s;tand up on their foreheads. The men pull off their beards by the roots, in&s;tead of &s;having them, and do not leave &s;o much as whi&s;kers; and &s;uffer no hair on their bodies, below the girdle. As to their dre&s;s, it is much the &s;ame as that of the other countries in this penin&s;ula. The king wears a cap in the form of a &s;ugar-loaf, ending with a circle or coronet of precious &s;tones a|bout it; and tho&s;e of his officers have circles of gold, &s;ilver, or vermillion gilt, to di&s;tingui&s;h their quality. The common people go almo&s;t naked.</P>
<P>The king's forces are as numerous as his &s;ub|jects: he commands the &s;ervice of all, both in peace and war. The chief &s;trength of their armies is in their elephants, of which they maintain &s;e|veral hundreds, trained up to war.</P>
<P>The king's revenues ari&s;e from the lands of the crown, and a rent that is paid him in kind out of all the lands in his dominions, and by monopolies of al|mo&s;t every branch of trade; but he does not receive in money above &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds per annum.

<P>At Siam, all per&s;ons are freemen or &s;laves; and are either born or become &s;uch. One may become a &s;lave either for debt, by being taken in war; or by way of puni&s;hment. They &s;ometimes &s;ell them&s;elves and children, for victuals; and even for the &s;ake of eating a delicious fruit, called durion. Their &s;lavery is very gentle, as in cul|tivating lands, tending gardens, or &s;ome other dome&s;tic &s;ervices; or el&s;e they permit them to work for them&s;elves, paying a tribute to their ma&s;ters, from about three &s;hillings and &s;ix-pence to &s;even &s;hillings a year. A &s;lave for debt has his li|berty again, on making &s;atisfaction; but the chil|dren born during this &s;lavery continue &s;laves. A per&s;on is born a &s;lave, when the mother is a &s;lave: if &s;he conver&s;es with the father, without her ma|&s;ter's con&s;ent, all the children are his; if with his con&s;ent, they are divided, as in ca&s;e of divorce: the fir&s;t, and every odd number, belong to the mo|ther's ma&s;ter; the re&s;t, or even numbers, to the fa|ther, if he be free, or to his ma&s;ter, if he is a &s;lave. The difference between the king of Siam's &s;laves and his &s;ubjects is, that he maintains his &s;laves, who are continually employed; whereas, his free &s;ubjects owe him only &s;ix months &s;ervice in the year, but at their own expence; nor is there any &s;ervice due to him from the &s;laves of the&s;e latter.</P>
<P>All rank and nobility here depends upon the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of places; &s;o that the grand-&s;on of a great lord, and &s;ometimes his &s;on, are &s;een rowing a boat. As the freemen are all &s;oldiers, they are carefully regi&s;tered, that none may avoid doing his duty</P>

The Siame&s;e have two languages, the common, and the B&acirc;lli, which is their learned or &s;acred language. The fir&s;t has thirty-&s;even, the latter thirty-three letters, all con&s;onants; and both are written from the left to the right. The Siame&s;e re&s;embles the Chine&s;e in &s;everal re&s;pects: it con&s;i&s;ts mo&s;tly in mono&s;yllables; and has neither declen|&s;ions nor conjugations, which are &s;upplied by four or five particles, placed either before or after the verb. They have likewi&s;e a great deal of accent, like the Chine&s;e, and almo&s;t &s;ing in &s;peaking. In other re&s;pects, however, the two languages differ con&s;iderably.</P>
<P>In Siam they have one &s;ort of &s;ilver coin called a tycal, which are all of the &s;ame fa&s;hion, and have the &s;ame &s;tamps; but &s;ome are le&s;s than others they are of the figure of a cylinder or roll, bent both ends together, and have a &s;tamp on each &s;ide, with odd characters, the meaning of which our travellers give us no account of: tho&s;e on one &s;ide are included within a ring, and tho&s;e on the rever&s;e within a figure of the &s;hape of a heart. The ty|cal &s;hould weigh half a French crown, and is worth there three &s;hillings and three half-pence. They have no gold nor copper money. Gold is reckon|ed among their merchantable commodities, and is twelve times the value of &s;ilver. Tho&s;e &s;hells, call|ed cori's, &s;erve to buy little matters: they are found chiefly at the Maldive i&s;lands, to the &s;outh of India, and are current in all countries therea|bouts: they differ in their price, as they are plenty or &s;carce; but the value of them at Siam is gene|rally eight hundred for a penny.</P>
<P>Siam is divided into the Upper and Lower, and tho&s;e again into provinces. The principal inland cities in the kingdom are &s;aid to be Siam, from which the kingdom takes its name, Me-tak,
<PB N="121" REF="1210">
Kampeng, Lakon&s;evan, Tian-tong, Pit&s;anoulouk, Meuang, Fang, Lakontay, Tana&s;&s;erim, Konra&s;e|ma, Kamburi, Soko-tay, Sanguelouk, Louvo, Bankok, and Prabat.</P>
<P>Siam, the capital, called by the natives Si-yo|thi-ya, &s;tands on an i&s;land in the river Men&acirc;m, in 14&deg;. 18&prime;. north latitude, and 98&deg;. 30&prime;. ea&s;t longi|tude, from the meridian of Ferro. The king's palace &s;tands to the north, on the canal which &s;ur|rounds the city, and is about a mile and a half in circuit. Haughtine&s;s, de&s;poti&s;m, and ab&s;olute government, are the only marks by which the king chu&s;es to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from all other &s;overeigns. The re&s;pect which he demands of his people reaches almo&s;t to adoration; and the po&s;ture in which they mu&s;t appear in his pre&s;ence is a te&s;timony of it. Even in council, which la&s;ts &s;ometimes four hours, the mini&s;ters of &s;tate, and the mandarins, are continually pro&s;trated before him. They never &s;peak to him but on their knees, having their hands rai&s;ed to their heads, making every moment pro|found reverences, and accompanying their di&s;|cour&s;e with pompous titles, celebrating his power and his goodne&s;s. Siam is &s;pacious, con&s;idering the compa&s;s of the walls; but &s;carce a &s;ixth part of it is inhabited: however, &s;ome amends is made by the &s;uburbs, which are inhabited by &s;trangers. No|body ever pa&s;&s;es by the pra&s;&s;at or palace by water; and if the current happens to carry them athwart, they are &s;ure to be pelted with pea&s;e, which the king's &s;ervants &s;hoot at them from trunks. The king's apartment in the palace is covered with tin; nor can any thing be better done than the carving, with which it is adorned on every &s;ide: the gold al&s;o, which glitters in a thou&s;and places, di&s;tin|gui&s;hes it from all the other buildings.</P>
<P>Louvo &s;tands about nine or ten leagues from Siam, towards the north, on a branch of the Me|n&acirc;m.
<PB N="122" REF="1220">
Its &s;ituation is &s;o charming, and the air &s;o good, that the king &s;pends the greater part of the year there.</P>
<P>Bankok, the mo&s;t important place in the whole kingdom, &s;tands about eighteen leagues to the &s;outh of Siam, and twelve from the &s;ea. There is no other place on all the coa&s;t that is able to make any re&s;i&s;tance, be&s;ides this. The town has not only &s;tout walls, but &s;everal forts and batteries, mounted with good bra&s;s cannon.</P>
<P>Of the maritime cities the principal are Ligor, Singor, Pat&acirc;na, Mergui, and Jon&s;alam. At Ligor, which &s;tands on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the penin|&s;ula of Maiacca, a part of which belongs to Siam, the Dutch have a factory. Its commodities are kalin, or tin, rice, fruits, and, in &s;ome years, much pepper. Patana, on the &s;ame coa&s;t, be|longs to the king of Jahor, or Jaar, who is tribu|tary to the king of Siam. Mergui, on the we&s;t|&s;ide of the penin&s;ula, is one of the be&s;t and mo&s;t &s;ecure ports in all the Indies. A great number of Engli&s;h free merchants were once &s;ettled at Mergui, and drove a con&s;iderable trade. The city of Ta|na&s;&s;erim, which lies only &s;even leagues from Margui, is famous for Nipa, or Niper wine, which is a &s;pirituous liquor, di&s;tilled from cocoa-nut wa|ter, the be&s;t in the Indies. Oppo&s;ite to the coa&s;t of Tana&s;&s;erim are the i&s;lands of Andeman, about eighty leagues di&s;tant, &s;urrounded with dangerous banks and rocks. They are all inhabited by can|nibals, who are &s;o fearle&s;s, that they will &s;win off to a boat, if &s;he approach near the &s;hore, and at|tack her with their wooden &s;words, notwith&s;tand|ing the &s;uperiority of numbers, and the advantage of fire-arms, as well as mi&s;&s;ive weapons. The&s;e i&s;lands abound with quick&s;ilver. Con&s;iderably to the &s;outh of Mergui lies the port and i&s;land of Jon|&s;alam, clo&s;e to the coa&s;t: about ninety leagues from

<HEAD>KINGDOM of QUEDAH.</HEAD>
<P>The kingdom of Quedah lies in the penin&s;ula of Malacca, to the &s;outh of Jon&s;alam. It is but poor and &s;mall, and takes its name from its capital, which &s;tands on the banks of a &s;mall navigable river, about fifty miles from the we&s;t coa&s;t. The reli|gion of the country is Mohammedi&s;m, but much mixed with pagani&s;m. Its produce is tin, pepper, elephants and their teeth, canes, and damar, a gum u&s;ed in making pitch and tar for &s;hipping. The petty king of Quedah was for many years tri|butary to Siam, but is now independent.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The KINGDOM of JOHOR.</HEAD>
<P>The remaining part of the penin&s;ula of Malacca properly belongs to the kingdom of Johor, or Joar, which begins at Perah, the next country to Quedah, &s;outhwards, and reaches to Point Romar, or Ro|naro, the mo&s;t &s;outhern promontory of all, it be|ing but one degree to the north of the equator; but the Dutch may be &s;aid to be the real ma&s;ters and &s;overeigns of the whole penin&s;ula, being po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of the city of Malacca, the capital, and &s;eve|ral other &s;ettlements on the coa&s;t; where they u&s;u|ally have a &s;quadron of men of war, which com|mands the coa&s;ts of the Further India and the Straits of Malacca, through which none, be&s;ides the Engli&s;h, can pa&s;s, without their leave, into the Chine&s;ian &s;ea.</P>
<P>The penin&s;ula of Malacca lies between the Strait of that name, and the Gulph of Siam. Some tra|vellers a&s;&s;ure us, that it is divided into &s;even king|doms, every one of which may be about ten leagues
<PB N="124" REF="1240">
in breadth, and thirty in length. It was di&s;covered, in 1509, by Seguera; and, in 1511, by Alphon&s;o Albuquerque, who made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the city of Malacca. The Dutch, &s;upported by the forces of the king of Joar or Thor, began, in 1606, to di&s;trub the Portugue&s;e in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and, after thirty five years of continual ho&s;tilities, took it from them, in 1641.</P>
<P>The inhabitants $Span$, or the Malays, are, for the $Span$ live after the man|ner of bea&s;ts. The heat of the climate, which is almo&s;t under the line, renders their colour extreme|ly &s;warthy, and they are very fond of the Euro|peans, on account of their whitene&s;s. As &s;oon as they arrive on their coa&s;ts, they offer them their wives and daughters, that they may have children like them. Notwith&s;tanding the barbarity of their manners, their language is reckoned the fine&s;t in all the Indies, where it is at lea&s;t as common as the French in Europe. It is very ea&s;ily acquired, be|cau&s;e it has no inflexions, either in nouns or verbs. The country is rich, only in effect of its commerce with the Chine&s;e: it mu&s;t then have been thro' ig|norance or mi&s;take, that the antients gave it the name of the Golden Cher&s;one&s;e; or rather it is evi|dent, that this mu&s;t not have been the country to which they gave that name: yet we are told by &s;ome mi&s;&s;ionaries, that they reckon their riches by bars of gold, and that every bar contains four quintals.</P>
<P>We are further told, that there is a particular &s;pecies of men in Malacca, who can &s;ee only in the night, and therefore &s;leep all day till &s;un-&s;et, when they get up to work. They, in &s;hape, as well as complexion, re&s;emble the Europeans, having grey eyes, and yellowi&s;h hair, which reaches to the womens hips, only their feet turn inwards. People of the &s;ame
<PB N="125" REF="1250">
kind are found in &s;ome other places of the Indies, and al&s;o in Africa.</P>
<P>The principal place in this country is the city and port of Malacca, which was the re&s;idence of the king of Jahor, till he was di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it by the Portugue&s;e, in 1510: but it now belongs to the Dutch, and not only gives name to a parti|cular kingdom, formerly included in that of Jahor, but to the whole penin&s;ula, and the Straits on which it &s;tands. The road is one of the fine&s;t in the Indies, and &s;hips may &s;afely ride in it at all &s;ea|&s;ons, an advantage which &s;carce any other in tho&s;e parts enjoys. When the Portugue&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it, it was the riche&s;t city in the Ea&s;t, next to Goa and Ormus, being the key of the China, Japan, the Moluccas, and Sunda trade. What greatly con|tributes to this is, that all &s;hips, pa&s;&s;ing from the north to the we&s;t, or from the we&s;t to the north, are under a nece&s;&s;ity of pa&s;&s;ing through the Straits of Malacca and Sinkapura. Hence the Portu|gue&s;e exacted ten per cent. of all ve&s;&s;els pa&s;&s;ing this way, which produced a va&s;t revenue: but the Dutch have aboli&s;hed this cu&s;tom, as a very un|rea&s;onable impo&s;ition. The natives of Malacca, and the neighbouring country, excepting the wo|men, go naked, all but a piece of cloth, wrapped about their wai&s;t. The fort of Malacca is both large and &s;trong, and the governor's hou&s;e beauti|ful and convenient. The country produces no|thing for a foreign market, but a little tin and ele|phants teeth; yet &s;trangers meet with &s;everal re|fre&s;hments, as &s;wines fle&s;h, poultry, roots, and excellent fruits, &s;uch as lemons, oranges, mangos, pine-apples, mangu&s;tans, rombo&s;tans, durions, and the like. At Malacca the &s;traits are not above four leagues in breadth, and always &s;mooth as a mill-pond, except when ruffled with wind. From a very high mountain, north-ea&s;tward of the city,
<PB N="126" REF="1260">
de&s;cend &s;everal rivers, and among the re&s;t that of Malacca, which all afford &s;ome &s;mall quanties of gold du&s;t. The inland people, called Monakabos, are of a &s;avage kind, and delight &s;o much in mi&s;|chief, that if the Malayan pea&s;ants &s;ow grain in any ground but what is well fenced, they come and burn it. The city of Malacca is large, and drives a good trade, in con&s;equence of its ex|cellent &s;ituation, which renders it the &s;tore-hou&s;e and magazine of all that part of India. The greate&s;t inconveniency at Malacca is the &s;carcity of mo&s;t &s;orts of provi&s;ions, except fi&s;h. Some of the inha|bitants are idolaters, but, generally &s;peaking, they are Mohammedans. On the &s;teeple of the Dutch church, which &s;tands on the top of a hill, a flag &s;taff is placed, on which a flag is hoi&s;ted, on the &s;ight of any &s;hips. It is the importance of its &s;ituation, that makes Malacca &s;o much regarded. It &s;tands in the mid&s;t of the &s;ea, and, if the expre&s;&s;ion may be allowed, divides India from India, that is, there can be no commerce &s;afely carried on from the coa&s;ts of Malabar, Coromandel, or the Bay of Ben|gal, to Sumatra, Borneo, Java, or the re&s;t of the i&s;lands, or to China, and Japan, without the leave of &s;uch as are ma&s;ters of it. There are about three hundred Dutch families in the town, and a much larger number of Chine&s;e, Malayans, and other In|dian nations. The be&s;t part of the Dutch com|pany's revenues here ari&s;e from the cu&s;toms, licences, and duties.</P>
<P>The countries that lie behind Malacca, abound with gold, tin, pepper, elephants teeth, agala wood, cinnamon, eagle and kalambak woods, &s;apan wood, diamonds, and hog-&s;tones, reckoned more effica|cious than the bazoar-&s;tones, benjamin, rattans, and canes, but very little rice, or other grain, is &s;own by the natives. The people in &s;ome of the parts &s;ub&s;i&s;t much on &s;ago, which is the pith of a
<PB N="127" REF="1270">
&s;mall twig, &s;plit and dried in the &s;un. The Eng|li&s;h &s;end to Malacca two or three country &s;hips yearly, from the coa&s;t of Coromandel, and Bay of Bengal, with callicoes, &s;light &s;ilks, and opium, and make profitable returns in the abovemention|ed commodities; but this is a trade prohibited by the Dutch, and carried on by the connivance of the governor, council, and fi&s;cal; and it is ob&s;erved, that the magi&s;trates, and principal officers in the Dutch &s;ettlements, being mo&s;t of them friends and relations of tho&s;e who compo&s;e the &s;tate, and &s;ent abroad to make their fortunes, will deal almo&s;t with any people to enrich their private families, notwith&s;tanding the prohibition of the company. Some travellers relate, that cloves and nutmegs grow in this country, whereas cloves are the pro|duce of Amboyna, and the Malucca i&s;lands only, and nutmegs and mace of the Banda i&s;lands, one thou&s;and miles ea&s;t of Malacca; but it may be true, that foreigners meet with the&s;e &s;pice at Ma|lacca, which they may purcha&s;e of the Dutch go|vernors and officers, who make little &s;cruple of cheating their ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>The only other towns worth mentioning in the penin&s;ula are, Jor, Joar, Johor, Pah&acirc;n, Pah&acirc;ng, or P&acirc;n, by the Portugueze called Paon, and by others, after the Arabs, F&acirc;n. The former of the&s;e gives name to a kingdom, including under it many petty kingdoms, of which Pahan is one.</P>

<HEAD>The KINGDOM of CAMBODIA.</HEAD>
<P>This country, &s;ituated between the ninth and &s;ixteenth degree thirty minutes of north lat. and be|tween the one hundred and nineteenth degree thirty minutes, and the one hundred and twenty-&s;ixth degree of ea&s;tern longitude, reckoning from the meridian of Paris, is bounded on the we&s;t by Siam;
<PB N="128" REF="1280">
on the north by the kingdom of Lanjang and Laos, with part of Kochin-China; on the ea&s;t by Kochin-China and Chiampa; and on the &s;outh by the bays of Cambodia and Siam, or, more di&s;tinctly, by the former on the &s;outh-ea&s;t, and by the latter on the &s;outh-we&s;t, on which &s;ide its greate&s;t ex|tent of &s;ea coa&s;t lies. As it &s;tretches &s;even degrees thirty-&s;ix minutes from &s;outh to north, its greate&s;t length that way is about five hundred and twenty Engli&s;h miles; and its greate&s;t breadth from we&s;t to ea&s;t, including &s;ix degrees thirty minutes of longi|tude, about three hundred and ninety-eight miles.</P>
<P>The land of Cambodia may be compared to a great valley, with a &s;pacious river running through the mid&s;t of it, lying between two chains of moun|tains, which extend from north-we&s;t to &s;outh-ea&s;t; &s;eparating it on one &s;ide from the kingdom of Siam, and on the other from tho&s;e of Kochin-China and Chiampa: &s;o that it, in a good mea&s;ure, re&s;em|bles Egypt, with this difference, that the valley or &s;pace between the mountains is not &s;o long as that of Egypt, but is much more extended as to breadth.</P>
<P>The air mu&s;t needs be very hot, in con&s;equence of its being &s;ituated &s;o near the line; and as it is inhabited almo&s;t &s;olely near the great river and its branches, it is attended with the inconvenience to which countries over-grown with woods, and un|cultivated, are &s;ubject, that is, of being much pe&s;tered with mu&s;kettoes, which are extremely trouble&s;ome to the navigation of the river.</P>
<P>The &s;oil, however, in fertility, is equal to mo&s;t Indian regions, yielding corn, rice, peas, butter, oil, and other provi&s;ions, in &s;uch plenty, that Spaniards, Per&s;ians, Arabs, and Armenians, re|&s;ort thither to bring them away. It abounds with fruits of various kinds, and drugs, &s;uch as bangue, &s;anders, and opium. The &s;ugar is very good, and
<PB N="129" REF="1290">
indigo is prepared here after an excellent manner. Kalamba, aloes, &s;apan wood, agala wood, &s;tick|lack, and lack for japanning, be&s;ides many phy|&s;ical drugs, are found in Cambodia, with variety of precious &s;tones, &s;uch as amethy&s;ts, garnets, hyacinths, cornelians, chry&s;olites, agates, and cats|eyes; not to mention milk-&s;tones and blood-&s;tones, be&s;ides a &s;ort of chry&s;tal found in the mountains, which is exceedingly tran&s;parent.</P>
<P>Raw &s;ilk, and elephants teeth, may be had in this country at rea&s;onable rates; the fir&s;t for le&s;s than a dollar the pound weight, and the large&s;t teeth for fifty or fifty-five dollars each. Gold like|wi&s;e is among the productions of Cambodia, of twenty-one carats fine. Provi&s;ions of fle&s;h and fi&s;h are exceeding cheap; a bullock of between four and five hundred pounds weight, may be bought for a Spani&s;h dollar; above one hundred weight of rice for eight-pence. The woods are full of elephants, tigers, bears, lions, rhinocero&s;es, wild cattle, buffaloes, and deer. The &s;ea abounds with fi&s;h, particularly large turtles of a delicious ta&s;te, with who&s;e &s;hells and oil the inhabitants drive a con&s;iderable trade on the continent. Of a fi&s;h, like anchovies, they make a brine or pickle, which the Cochin-Chine&s;e mix with rice. There are but few birds: the mo&s;t remarkable are &s;par|hawks, who are at continual war with the fi&s;hes; and a bird, as large as a wood-hen, which is of a beautiful green, with a &s;tripe of white at the end of the tail.</P>
<P>In &s;ome of the i&s;lands on the coa&s;t of Cambodia, particularly in Pulo Kond&ocirc;r, be&s;ides apes in prodi|gious numbers, there are five kinds of lizards, one &s;ort like tho&s;e in France: the re&s;t are of the &s;ize of common &s;erpents. Some of them have wings, and are of the bigne&s;s, as well as the colour, of lizards; under the chin they have a pur&s;e, which
<PB N="130" REF="1300">
&s;wells and falls in breathing. Other lizards are covered with &s;cales, and of a frightful a&s;pect; what is wor&s;e, their bite is mortal. Another &s;ort, which is likewi&s;e &s;caly, has hands and feet, armed with claws, as large as tho&s;e of a boy of fifteen. In Pulo Kond&ocirc;r are al&s;o flying &s;quirrels; rats which have ears like the human; dormice as large as fowls; butterflies with trunks, and a great variety of &s;er|pents and in&s;ects.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to trees, both the continent and i&s;lands abound with the areka, mango, ebony of all &s;orts, and milk-trees; al&s;o bamb&ucirc;, rattan, wild mu&s;cadine, almond, and medlar trees; of cotton, papaya, citron, and tamarind trees, there are but few: all the palm trees and aloes are wild; &s;o are the latan and banana trees. One meets al&s;o with the &s;quolante, the capillaire, and ananas; be&s;ides many beautiful plants and flowers, worth the ob|&s;ervation of botani&s;ts. There is a tree which af|fords an oil, called Goudron by Dampier. By &s;leeping the bark of a tree in this oil the inhabi|tants make torches, which afford a very clear light. Many of the trees are odoriferous, and &s;ome yield gums, of which one much re&s;embles benjamin.</P>
<P>The u&s;e of betel is not peculiar to the people of this country; nothing is &s;o common throughout the Indies, and bread is not more &s;o in other places of the world. It is a plant which creeps along the ground like peas or hops; and its &s;talk being weak, it mu&s;t be &s;upported by a prop, or planted near the tree areka, to which it fixes it&s;elf like ivy. Its leaf re&s;embles that of the citron tree, though a little longer; its &s;talks and fibres are al&s;o &s;tronger, and it becomes reddi&s;h when dried. Betel thrives be&s;t in watery places, &s;uch as the banks of the &s;ea, or rivers. There it bears a fruit, like a rat's tail; but produces none in climates too hot or too cold, where the inhabitants mu&s;t be contented with the
<PB N="131" REF="1310">
leaf, which is prepared with the fruit of areka, and a little lime made of oy&s;ter &s;hells. An Indian is &s;eldom &s;een without betel in his mouth. As &s;oon as any one goes into a hou&s;e on bu&s;ine&s;s, or to make a vi&s;it, it is brought and pre&s;ented to the company by way of compliment. When foreign amba&s;&s;adors are admitted to an audience of the king, they find him commonly repo&s;ing on his couch, or &s;eated cro&s;s-legged on a carpet on the ground, with an officer in waiting, who holds his betel, which he chews continually, throwing out the hu&s;ks and &s;aliva, which it produces. The greate&s;t honour he can do them, is to invite them to ta&s;te his betel. The Indians &s;ay it fa&s;tens the gums, pre&s;erves the teeth, makes the breath &s;weet, is good for the &s;tomach, promotes dige&s;tion, pre|vents wind and vomiting, to which they are very &s;ubject; and, la&s;tly, prevents the &s;curvy. Not|with&s;tanding all the&s;e real, or imaginary qualities, few Europeans can accu&s;tom them&s;elves to it. In many it occa&s;ions &s;ickne&s;s, others it perfectly in|toxicates, but &s;o as not to la&s;t long.</P>
<P>The areca, which is u&s;ed with the leaves of the betel, is taken from a tree nearly re&s;embling the cocoa in height and &s;hape, except that its trunk is &s;maller, and its leaves &s;horter: from beneath the leaves there proceeds a long ma&s;s, which forms a bunch, or clu&s;ter of fruit, like nuts, or apricots; the flowers are intermingled with the fruit: two months after the flowers fall off, the hu&s;ks, which cover the fruit, begin to open and fall off: then an oblong fruit appears of the bulk of a middling plum, of a whiti&s;h and &s;hining colour, its &s;hell becomes firm, compact, and reddi&s;h; the pulp contained in it is of a brown ca&s;t, bordering on red, and &s;oft and a&s;tringent to the ta&s;te. The Indians prepare the pulp, or kernels of this fruit, with the
<PB N="132" REF="1320">
leaves of the betel, dividing a nut into eight or ten parts.</P>
<P>A river, called by &s;ome authors Menon, Menan, or Mecon, but u&s;ually the river of Cambodia, and of the Laos, and by many reckoned the large&s;t in all the Indies, traver&s;es Cambodia from north-we&s;t to &s;outh-ea&s;t, and increa&s;es &s;o much in &s;ummer, that it overflows the adjacent country like the Nile in Egypt.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Cambodia, though very fertile, is but thinly peepled. Their dre&s;s and complexion is much the &s;ame as tho&s;e of the other countries in this penin&s;ula, and they go with their head and feet bare. They do not trade much them&s;elves by &s;ea; but foreigners re&s;ort to them for the &s;ake of the merchandize which their country affords, and e&s;pecially provi&s;ions, which are very plentiful and cheap. Their chief commodities are gold, raw &s;ilk, ivory, odoriferous woods, and drugs. They have &s;ome manufactures, particularly divers forts of cotton cloths, calicoes, mu&s;lins, buckrams, white and painted dimities, and the like. They have carpets al&s;o, though not like tho&s;e that come from Per&s;ia, and a &s;ort called bancales, re&s;embling Scotch plaids. They both weave, and work with the needle, rich &s;ilk hangings, and coverings for chairs, palankins, and other furniture.</P>
<P>According to captain Hamilton, the Cambodians wor&s;hip the &s;ame gods that are wor&s;hipped in Siam. They adore the &s;upreme God, under the name of Tipedah, giving him Praw, Prumb, and Praw|pout for his &s;ons. They hold the tran&s;migration of &s;ouls; and that, for the reception of &s;ouls after this life, there are twenty-&s;even heavens, or man|&s;ions, and thirteen hells, one above the other, and that mo&s;t of the heavens are furni&s;hed with &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures; &s;uch as delicious food, liquors of various kinds, and beautiful women. Thither they be|lieve
<PB N="133" REF="1330">
all living creatures, not excepting the &s;mall in&s;ects, go. Temples and pyramids are very nu|merous throughout the country; &s;ome are built of wood, others with &s;tone, and all well guilded with|in, as their idols are on the out&s;ide. Their prie&s;ts, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal orders, have much the advan|tage of the other cla&s;&s;es of the natives, who are all &s;laves.</P>
<P>The king of Cambodia is &s;o de&s;potic, that not only the land, but the effects of his &s;ubjects, or rather &s;laves, fall to him at their deaths; &s;o that the wife and children have nothing to tru&s;t to, but what they can conceal, or convey away by &s;tealth: yet here, as in mo&s;t of the other ea&s;tern kingdoms, the meane&s;t per&s;ons may have acce&s;s to the king. The principal officers, as the king's coun&s;ellors, the governors of provinces, cities, and towns, and the chief magi&s;trates, are &s;tiled oknias, or okinas. The&s;e are known by a gold box for holding their betel. The officers of the &s;econd rank are named tonimas, or tonimnes, who are allowed only to have &s;ilver boxes for their pinang or betel.</P>
<P>Although the coa&s;t of Cambodia extends about one hundred and forty leagues along the &s;ea, there are not in that &s;pace above five or &s;ix ports fit to receive &s;hips; at lea&s;t Europeans have not di&s;co|vered more: of the&s;e the mo&s;t con&s;iderable are Kupang-&s;oap, and Ponteamas, or Pontiamo. On the &s;outh-we&s;t &s;ide lie a great many i&s;lands, e&s;pe|cially towards Siam. The capital city, called Lowek, &s;tands on a branch of the river Mecon, about three hundred miles from its mouth; and is inhabited by Japane&s;e, Kochin-Chine&s;e, Malayans, and Topa&s;&s;es, or Indian Portugue&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>The KINGDOM of CHAMPA.</HEAD>
<P>Between Cambodia and Kochin-China lies the &s;mall kingdom of Champa, being in length from &s;outh-we&s;t to north-ea&s;t about fourteen Engli&s;h miles, and in breadth about &s;eventy.</P>
<P>The natives are called Loys, and are a very different people from the Cochin-Chine&s;e, to whom their king at pre&s;ent is tributary. Their forces con&s;i&s;t in &s;ome gallies, each having on board forty or fifty men, and mounting two &s;mall guns. Their arms are mu&s;kets, pikes, &s;abres, and &s;agays, which they handle very dexterou&s;ly. There is among them a tribe, called Moys, who inhabit the moun|tains, and are employed by them in all &s;orts of drudgery as &s;laves. A piece of cloth to cover their nakedne&s;s is all their dre&s;s. A remarkable &s;ubordination prevails among the Loys, from the king, the mandarins, and the placemen, to the commonalty. All religions are tolerated, and free|ly exerci&s;ed in Champa; but tho&s;e mo&s;t prevailing are the Mohammedan and doctrine of Confucius. Nor is idolatry without its votaries al&s;o; &s;ome a|dore animals, others the &s;un, moon, and &s;tars, or the heavens. One thing extraordinary found here is, that the Mohammedans of this country eat &s;wines fle&s;h, and offer their wives to &s;trangers, excepting their legal one, whom they cannot di|vorce, without convicting her of incontinence.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of Champa within land is very little known to Europeans. The &s;outh part of the coun|try is &s;aid to produce a little cotton, &s;ome indigo, and bad &s;ilk. Ships come from China every year, loaded with tea, ordinary &s;ilk, china ware, and provi&s;ions, for which they take in exchange gold, which is finer than that of China, and a certain &s;weet &s;cented wood, which grows on this coa&s;t,

in order to burn on the tombs of their parents, and in honour of their images.</P>

<HEAD>The KINGDOM of COCHIN-CHINA.</HEAD>
<P>Cochin-China, i. e. the We&s;tern-China, &s;o called by the Portugue&s;e, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the king|dom of Cochin on the Malabar coa&s;t, is &s;ituated under the torrid zone, and extends, according to &s;ome authors, from the 12th to the 18th degree, but, according to others, from the 8th to the 17th degree of north latitude, or about five hundred miles in length; but is much le&s;s exten&s;ive in its breadth from ea&s;t to we&s;t. It is bounded by Ton|quin on the north; by the &s;mall kingdom of Champa, or Chiampa, on the &s;outh; by the Chi|ne&s;e Ocean on the ea&s;t; and on the we&s;t by the kingdoms of Laos and Cambodia, both which are tributary to it, as well as that of Champa, and &s;ome others.</P>
<P>The inundations which happen regularly every year here, as in Siam, and other neighbouring kingdoms, towards the middle of autumn, and continue two whole months, render the land ex|ceedingly fertile, e&s;pecially in rice, by the great quantity of mud they leave behind.</P>
<P>There is no country under the torrid zone, wherein the four &s;ea&s;ons are better di&s;tingui&s;hed. Though the rivers are not con&s;iderable, they are the &s;ources of its plenty. During the months of September, October, and November, they ri&s;e every fortnight, overflow all the fields for three days, and render them &s;o fertile by their &s;lime, that they can &s;ow and reap twice a-year. The &s;oil produces not only great quantities of rice, but &s;e|veral &s;orts of fruits and herbs, pepper, cinnamon, benjoin, &s;ilk, cotton, aloes, eagle wood, and others of the &s;ame rare and odoriferous nature, be&s;ides a
<PB N="136" REF="1360">
tree, which they &s;tile the incorruptible, it not be|ing liable to rot or corrupt under water; and ano|ther that produces che&s;nuts, larger than tho&s;e we have from Spain, by &s;ackfuls, &s;ome of the bunches containing no le&s;s than five hundred che&s;nuts. In the mountains are al&s;o found quarries of &s;everal &s;orts of marble, with mines of gold, &s;ilver, and iron. The natives have learned the art of fu&s;ing and applying the la&s;t to a variety of u&s;es, from the Chine&s;e; but are &s;till ignorant of the art of ca&s;ting it, e&s;pecially into cannon, bombs, mortars, and other artillery. Among the rare animals, are rhinocero&s;es and elephants, of an extraordinary &s;ize, and &s;urpri&s;ing docility. The feet of the male ele|phants here are &s;aid to be full half a yard in dia|meter, and their teeth between four and five yards in length.</P>
<P>The Cochin-Chine&s;e, lying under the &s;ame pa|rallel as the Siame&s;e, are of much the &s;ame &s;tature and complexion; their habits, however, are &s;omewhat different. The inhabitants of Cochin-China wear a long gown, which is bound about them with a &s;a&s;h, and the &s;exes are &s;carce di&s;tingui&s;hable by their garb: the quality u&s;ually wear &s;ilk; but they never think them&s;elves finer than in Engli&s;h broad cloth, either red or green, and have caps of the &s;ame &s;tuff with their gowns. Inferior people and &s;oldiers generally wear cotton cloth, dyed of a dark colour. Poor people go bare headed, ex|cept in the rainy &s;ea&s;ons, when they wear &s;tiff broad brimmed hats, made of reeds, or palm leaves. They &s;it cro&s;s-legged, after the manner of the Siame&s;e, and other A&s;iatics, and have couches, or benches, covered with fine mat, round the rooms, where they entertain their friends. The people are excellent mechanics, and very fair dealers, not given to tricking and cheating like the Chine&s;e.
<PB N="137" REF="1370">
In mo&s;t other re&s;pects, however, they very much re&s;emble that people.</P>
<P>The country is exceeding populous, containing a great number of open towns, be&s;ides villages, which are &s;o numerous, that they &s;eem almo&s;t con|tiguous to one another. Their principal manufac|ture is that of &s;ilk, which they weave into a great variety of &s;tuffs; and which is produced in &s;uch plenty, that the &s;ails and cordage of the &s;hips, fi&s;h|ermen's nets, and other &s;uch mean implements, are made of it. Pepper, &s;ugar, honey, wax, and an oil, made in large quantities from their land|tortoi&s;es, are other branches of their commerce.</P>
<P>Their chief food is rice and pul&s;e, variou&s;ly dre&s;&s;ed and &s;ea&s;oned; and fi&s;h, of which they have great plenty and variety. They take up their victuals with iron &s;ticks, as is done in China. Their common drink is a &s;ort of tea which they cultivate among them, but which hath neither the fine ta&s;te nor flavour of the Chine&s;e. They have al&s;o &s;ome &s;trong liquors, brewed or di&s;tilled from rice, be&s;ides a water di&s;tilled from their calambac. Their treats to their vi&s;itors are u&s;ually the betel, a di&s;h of tea, and &s;ome tobacco; to which tho&s;e of the better &s;ort add perfumes.</P>
<P>The literati here never cut their nails or beards, and affect to wear high caps, in the &s;hape of a mi|tre. Their chief &s;tudy is a&s;tronomy, or rather a&s;trology, and that merely for the &s;ake of prying into future events: as in the other Indian nations, they look upon eclip&s;es as portending &s;ome great calamity.</P>
<P>Their religion is almo&s;t the &s;ame with that of the Chine&s;e, and was doubtle&s;s introduced among them whil&s;t they were under their dominion. The chova or king, and his court, the mandarins, and the generality of the grandees and literati, follow the &s;ect and doctrine of Confucius; while the re&s;t
<PB N="138" REF="1380">
of the people follow tho&s;e of Fo and Lao-kiun, and are wholly given up to the mo&s;t profound ig|norance, and the mo&s;t &s;tupid idolatries and &s;uper|&s;titions. The former have neither temples, prie&s;ts, nor &s;ettled wor&s;hip; but the latter have temples, and prie&s;ts or bonzes, as in China. They believe in the immortality of the &s;oul, and its tran&s;migration from one body to the other; and though they are, on that account, very aver&s;e to killing or hunting any living creatures, like the generality of the In|dians, they make no &s;cruple to offer great numbers of hogs in &s;acrifice to their idols. They have like|wi&s;e a notion that &s;ome of the &s;ouls of men, not being permitted to pa&s;s into other bodies, in time degenerate into evil &s;pirits and devils.</P>
<P>The government here is altogether de&s;potic; the king having an ab&s;olute power over the lives and fortunes of his &s;ubjects, to make or abrogate laws, to make peace or war, and to di&s;po&s;e of all dignities and offices, both civil and military, in the kingdom, without con&s;ulting any of his mini&s;ters. He governs his provinces by his mandarins; and whatever &s;entence he pa&s;&s;es from his tribunal of ju&s;tice is immediately executed, whether it be death, amputation of a limb, impri&s;onment, &s;lavery, or other puni&s;hment. Fal&s;e witne&s;s and adultery are capital crimes here: for the latter, the woman, as in Tonquin, is trodden to death by an elephant, and her paramour condemned to &s;ome more gentle death. Theft is puni&s;hed with the lo&s;s of a finger, for the fir&s;t and &s;econd fact; of two fingers, for the third; and of the head, for the fourth.</P>
<P>The kings of Cochin-China are very rich and opulent, having &s;everal princes tributary to them; particularly, tho&s;e of Thiem, Cambodia, and Chiampa. He has va&s;t quantities of odoriferous wood of various kinds, of gold du&s;t, and all the elephants teeth, which he &s;ells to the foreign
<PB N="139" REF="1390">
traders. He claims one third of all the rice of his kingdom, and the governors of the provinces are allowed a ninth part of all the re&s;t. Some pro|vinces, in&s;tead of rice, furni&s;h him with a certain number of hor&s;es, &s;laves, odoriferous woods, and other products of their land. Over and above the&s;e yearly tributes, every man, from the age of eighteen to &s;ixty, is obliged to pay him &s;ix crowns, and to work for him eight months a year. More|over, he is heir to all the princes and nobles of his kingdom; and at their death takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all their land, leaving only their effects to be di&s;tri|buted among their children. If to all the&s;e we add the pre&s;ents he receives from the mandarins, and other officers, with the impo&s;ts laid on foreign traders, we may be able to form &s;ome gro&s;s e&s;ti|mate of his immen&s;e yearly revenue.</P>
<P>His &s;tanding land forces amount to about thirty thou&s;and, and his naval to upwards of one hundred gallies: his &s;econd &s;on has the command of the former, and his elde&s;t of the latter The common pay of the &s;oldiers and &s;ailors is about &s;ix &s;hillings in money, a bu&s;hel of rice, and a certain quantity of fi&s;h, per month; which, together with their cloathing and accoutrements, is paid them regu|larly by the king. Their dre&s;s makes a very gal|lant appearance at their reviews; and, again&s;t an engagement, every common &s;oldier is cloathed in red, yellow, or green &s;attin, according to the co|lour of his regiment. The guards belonging to the king, and the princes of the blood, appear in velvet of divers colours, with their arms glittering with &s;ilver and gold; and the generals, and other officers, are, at &s;uch times, allowed to have their cloaths embroidered with the &s;ame, more or le&s;s richly, according to their rank. Nothing can ex|ceed the beauty of their gallies; being all varni&s;h|ed and gilt, and otherwi&s;e embelli&s;hed, with &s;ails
<PB N="140" REF="1400">
and ma&s;ts, after the Indian manner. The out&s;ide is varni&s;hed with black, the in&s;ide with red, and the oars are commonly gilt. Their arms are a mu&s;ket, a dagger, a bow, and arrows. They all wear the &s;ame garb, and of the &s;ame colour, viz. white &s;ilk trow&s;ers, and hair caps. Neither the ar|my or navy are furni&s;hed with either powder or ball; but only with materials for making them, which they mu&s;t afterwards fabricate for them|&s;elves. When any of them are found guilty of re|volting, or any other trea&s;onable crime, they are condemned to be tied naked to a po&s;t, at the head of all the forces, and every &s;oldier is obliged to come and cut off a piece of his fle&s;h, as long as he hath any left. Notwith&s;tanding all this order and di&s;cipline, we mu&s;t not &s;uppo&s;e that they are &s;uch adepts in war, or engage their enemies, whether in a &s;iege or battle, with that conduct and regularity that the Europeans do. Pitched battles are &s;eldom or never heard of in this part of the world; their fighting being little el&s;e than loo&s;e &s;kirmi&s;hes, or ha&s;ty encounters, between oppo&s;ite parties, one of which commonly betakes it&s;elf to flight after the fir&s;t on&s;et.</P>
<P>All the officers here, both military and civil, or at lea&s;t the far greater part of them, are eunuchs, as they are in mo&s;t other Indian &s;tates, and upon the &s;ame political account; namely, that they, having no children, the king may inherit their ef|fects, as well as their land.</P>
<P>There are no le&s;s, it is &s;aid, than &s;ixty good har|bours in this kingdom, which occa&s;ion the inhabi|tants to apply them&s;elves much to trade and navi|gation: that of Faifo is one of the mo&s;t con&s;i|derable. This city is inhabited by Chine&s;e and Japanese, who carry on a free trade, under the pro|tection of the prince. It is defended by a fortre&s;s, and &s;ituated on a navigable river, a little above its mouth. The capital, where the king u&s;ually re|&s;ides,
<PB N="141" REF="1410">
is called Kehue. Along the coa&s;t of Cochin-China are a great number of &s;mall i&s;lands, to which the natives give the name of Pullos. They are &s;urrounded with &s;uch a number of &s;hallows, rocks, and &s;helves, that &s;hipwrecks are very frequent among them.</P>

<HEAD>The KINGDOM of TONQUIN or TONG-KING.</HEAD>
<P>This is the la&s;t country in the farther penin|&s;ula of India which remains to be treated of. It is tributary to the Chine&s;e monarchs, as well as Cochin-China, and is commonly called Tun|kin, Tunquin, or Tonquin, by the Europeans. It is bounded on the north and ea&s;t by the Chine&s;e provinces of Quang&s;i and Yun-nan; on the we&s;t by the two &s;mall kingdoms of Law|chiva, which divide it from that of Siam on the &s;outh; and on the &s;outh-ea&s;t by Cochin-China, and the gulph of its name, called al&s;o the Gulph of Tonquin, becau&s;e it lies between them both. Ac|cording to the late&s;t accounts, it is &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;tretch about three hundred and &s;eventy miles in length, and two hundred and forty where broade&s;t. The gulph, which bounds a part of this kingdom, is of great extent, containing a number of &s;mall i&s;lands, and receiving into it two large rivers, be|&s;ides le&s;&s;er &s;treams.</P>
<P>The climate of Tonquin, though it be ju&s;t under the tropic, is reckoned &s;o mild and temperate that the whole year appears like a continual &s;pring, without any other material change than that of rain and &s;un&s;hine, wet and dry &s;ea&s;on. They have likewi&s;e only two winds that blow for a continuance, viz. the north and the &s;outh, which commonly blow &s;ix months alternately; the former from June or July to January, and the latter from January to July. But the mo&s;t agreeable &s;ea&s;on of the whole year begins about September, and ends in March;
<PB N="142" REF="1420">
during which the north wind blows almo&s;t without intermi&s;&s;ion, and renders the climate both healthy and temperate, yet without producing either ice or &s;now. The rainy &s;ea&s;on, which is the mo&s;t unhealthy part of the whole year, &s;eldom begins before the month of April, and la&s;ts only till Augu&s;t. It is during this &s;ea&s;on, however, that the trees are co|vered with fruit and verdure, and the plains with plenty of rice, and variety of other products. The &s;oil of Tonquin hath been gradually formed by the mud, which the rivers leave behind, and which makes the land exceeding fruitful, as far as the in|undations extend. All the higher grounds are dried up, and burnt by the &s;un, &s;oon after the rain is over; and though &s;ome of their lands are natu|rally fruitful, yet they are &s;o &s;ubject to drought, in|&s;ects, and other inconveniencies, that they are &s;ome|times deprived of their harve&s;t in the uplands &s;eve|ral years together; and &s;uch years are generally &s;ucceeded by pe&s;tilential di&s;tempers. Upon the land which the inundation does not reach, they &s;ometimes &s;ow wheat, and water it, like a garden, by little canals, cut through the fields. The moun|tains of Tonquin are covered with va&s;t fore&s;ts of various trees, and filled with elephants, deer, ti|gers, and other wild bea&s;ts. The products, in ge|neral, are much the &s;ame with tho&s;e of China, and other parts of India; but the greate&s;t part of their fruit-trees are &s;aid to exceed tho&s;e of all the re&s;t of A&s;ia in flavour, beauty, and the excellency of their fruit, but e&s;pecially the palm and orange-tree, of the large kind; but tho&s;e of the &s;mall kind, as well as their citrons, are reckoned unwhole&s;ome, e&s;pecially the latter, the juice of which, in &s;ome ca&s;es, is u&s;ed in&s;tead of aquafortis, for dying of calicoes. The gardens here are well furni&s;hed with potatoes, yams, onions, &amp;c. and their orchards with plan|tains, bananas, mangos, limes, cocoa-nuts, pine-apples,
<PB N="143" REF="1430">
and other &s;uch fruits. The betel, in &s;uch vogue all over India, in the leaf of which a &s;lice of areck-nut being wrapped up, is chewed with &s;o much delight, is found here in great plenty; as is al&s;o the tree that yields their fine varni&s;h or japan. The elephants of this country are reckoned the large&s;t and nimble&s;t in all A&s;ia. There is a great plenty and variety of fowls here, both wild and tame, with a &s;trange kind of mice, the hunting of which yields a plea&s;ant diver&s;ion to the inhabitants, and their fle&s;h a dainty di&s;h. They are about the bigne&s;s of a pullet, and have wings a foot and a half long, and commonly make their ne&s;ts on filbert, pi&s;tachio, and other nut-trees, who&s;e fruit is their chief fare, and gives their fle&s;h a fine reli&s;h. It is not the cats that make war again&s;t them here, but a particular breed of &s;mall dogs, and which drive them up the next tree they meet with, which they climb with great &s;wiftne&s;s, and, fa&s;tening their claws on the branches, hang all day long upon them, with their heads downwards: they have moreover &s;even claws on each wing, by which they cling &s;o fa&s;t, that when &s;hot dead, they conti|nue &s;till fixed to the bough. The&s;e creatures are preferred to any fowl, even by the Portugue&s;e.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to diet, the natives eat very &s;pa|ringly of fle&s;h, contenting them&s;elves with their boiled rice, herbs, roots, dried fi&s;h, and pickled eggs, except on &s;olemn occa&s;ions, as fe&s;tivals, weddings, burials, or anniver&s;aries, when they com|monly indulge them&s;elves, as far as their circum|&s;tances will allow, in great variety of fle&s;h and fowl; among which buffaloes, hor&s;es, goats, dogs, rabbits, rats, locu&s;ts, gee&s;e, ducks, wild and tame, frogs, tortoi&s;es, crabs, and other fi&s;h, &s;mall and great, make up the mo&s;t con&s;iderable part of the fea&s;t; and fruit, in great plenty and variety, the conclu&s;ion of it. They are likewi&s;e fond of pork,
<PB N="144" REF="1440">
cut into &s;lices and roa&s;ted altogether; but often chu&s;e to eat it raw, only minced and &s;ea&s;oned, much after the &s;ame manner as our &s;au&s;ages are. They &s;inge their oxen, as we do our hogs; and e&s;teem a raw beef &s;take, &s;oaked three or four hours in vinegar, a dainty mor&s;el. If an elephant die a natural death, the fle&s;h of it is commonly given to the poor, except the &s;nout or probo&s;cis, which is e&s;teemed a piece fit to be pre&s;ented to &s;ome great per&s;on. Among a variety of &s;auces which they u&s;e with their meat, one of the mo&s;t common and ad|mired is the ballachawn, which is made of fi&s;h, &s;hrimps, prawns, &amp;c. &s;oaked in &s;alt-water, until re|duced to a pulp. The liquor, which is afterwards drawn from it, is called newchmum, and both the&s;e are u&s;ed as a &s;auce by natives and Europeans: and even the poor people will mix the ballachawn with their boiled rice to give it a haut gout, rank and di&s;agreeable enough to tho&s;e who are not ac|cu&s;tomed to it, but which becomes plea&s;ant by u&s;e. Whatever is brought to their tables is dre&s;&s;ed and &s;erved with the greate&s;t nicene&s;s: even their ta|bles and ve&s;&s;els, as well as victuals, are perfumed. They u&s;e neither knives, forks, nor table-linen, but eat after the Chine&s;e manner, each per&s;on at a &s;eparate table, and handle their &s;ticks with the &s;ame dexterity; but ob&s;erve, e&s;pecially among the bet|ter &s;ort, a great decorum and profound &s;ilence all the time; in&s;omuch that it is looked upon as an af|front, or at lea&s;t a breach of good manners, to &s;peak a word until the repa&s;t is over. Their cu&s;|tom is to eat four times a day, as every where el&s;e in India.</P>
<P>They have two kinds of tea here; one, which is called chia-bang or chaw-bang, and is their com|mon drink, is a decoction of the leaves, and the other, which is called chaw-way, and is much plea|&s;anter
<PB N="145" REF="1450">
than the former, of the flowers of a certain plant.</P>
<P>The Tonquine&s;e are generally of a tawny colour, yet not &s;o deep as mo&s;t other Indians. Their faces are oval, and mo&s;tly flatti&s;h, yet graceful. Their hair is black, long, and lank; and they affect, both men and women, to have their teeth as black as po&s;&s;ible, that they may not re&s;emble the elephant's and dog's in whitene&s;s, which they look upon as the greate&s;t deformity.</P>
<P>The principal manufacture of Tonquin is that of &s;ilks, &s;uch as pelongs, &s;oo&s;ees, hawkins, penia&s;coes, and gauze: the pelongs and gauze are &s;ometimes plain, and &s;ometimes flowered. They make al&s;o &s;eve|ral other &s;orts of &s;ilks; but the&s;e are chiefly bought up by the Engli&s;h and Dutch. The lacquered ware is another manufacture in this kingdom, and e&s;teemed the be&s;t in the world, next to that of China and Japan; and the difference between the one and the other, is not &s;o much in the paint and varni&s;h as in the wood, which is much better in Japan than here.</P>
<P>The lacquer-hou&s;es are looked upon to be very unwhole&s;ome, from a poi&s;onous quality which is &s;aid to be in the lacquer, making the workmen break out in great blotches and boils. From this country are brought lignum aloes, turpentine, mu&s;k, rhubarb, and &s;everal other drugs.</P>
<P>Though Tonquin is full of &s;ilk, they &s;eldom ap|ply them&s;elves to work it, until the &s;hipping ar|rives; the people being &s;o mi&s;erably poor, by rea|&s;on of their lazine&s;s, their itch for gaming, and the oppre&s;&s;ion of the great lords, to whom the lands belong, and who&s;e va&s;&s;als they are, that they have not money enough to purcha&s;e materials; and therefore foreign merchants are obliged to advance them money, and wait &s;everal months, until their goods are wrought. So great, it is &s;aid, is the itch
<PB N="146" REF="1460">
of gaming among all ranks, that when once mo|ney, goods, and their very cloaths are lo&s;t, they will &s;take even their wives and children.</P>
<P>All here, except the king, literati, and grandees, who wear a kind of &s;andals, go barefoot; though one would be apt to wonder, e&s;pecially as the coun|try is &s;omewhat &s;andy, how they could endure the exce&s;&s;ive heat of the ground: but we &s;hall &s;ee, in the &s;equel, in many kingdoms under a hotter &s;un, and in more rocky countries, as in the empire of Aby&s;&s;inia, Lower Ethiopia, and other parts of Afri|ca, the very &s;ame cu&s;tom is ob&s;erved, without the lea&s;t inconvenience to the natives, though very painful to &s;trangers, not u&s;ed to it.</P>
<P>Tonquin had been heretofore &s;ubject to the va&s;t empire of China, when a famous robber, named Din, put him&s;elf at the head of a body of men of his own profe&s;&s;ion, whom he in&s;pired with the re&s;o|lution of taking up arms, and throwing off the yoke of &s;ervitude. He &s;ucceeded; and tho&s;e whom he had engaged in the revolt, out of gratitude, placed the crown upon his head. This revolution, which the Tonquine&s;e had flattered them&s;elves would have been productive of happine&s;s and tran|quillity, proved a &s;ource of the mo&s;t cruel inte&s;tine wars, &s;till more pernicious than their former &s;ub|jection to the Chine&s;e emperors. For &s;everal cen|turies after their revolt, they were almo&s;t continu|ally in arms, in &s;upport of the different factions which ambition and jealou&s;y had rai&s;ed up among them; and the families on the throne have been already &s;ix times changed. The i&s;&s;ue of the la&s;t ci|vil war was a treaty, by which the competitor of king Le, le&s;s de&s;irous of the title of &s;overeign than of real power and authority, left him all the exter|nal &s;plendor of a monarch, on condition that he &s;hould have the ab&s;olute command of the armies, with the greate&s;t part of the revenues of the king|dom;
<PB N="147" REF="1470">
and that his de&s;cendants &s;hould &s;ucceed to the &s;ame privileges. By virtue of this agreement, there are two &s;orts of kings: he who receives all the ho|nours of royalty is called the Bua, and the Chouah has all its advantages. The bua, &s;en&s;ible of the di|minution of his power, is &s;eldom &s;een out of his palace. He is taken up almo&s;t every day in giving audience to his &s;ubjects, hearing their complaints, and determining their private differences, which is the utmo&s;t extent of his power; for he can &s;et forth no act or edict, without the con&s;ent of the chouah. The princes, his &s;ons, partake of his &s;er|vitude: they never go out of the palace but four times a-year, and that only &s;ix days a time; and then they are attended by officers, whom the chouah appoints for them. In the fir&s;t of tho&s;e &s;ix days of liberty they vi&s;it the temples, the two following they take the diver&s;ion of hunting, and during the three la&s;t they &s;ail upon the river, in gallies magnificent|ly adorned. The right of primogeniture does not regulate the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown; the will of the father decides it in favour of him whom he loves or e&s;teems mo&s;t. As &s;oon as he is declared, the chouah, followed by his principal officers, the coun|&s;ellors of &s;tate, and the eunuchs, do him homage, and take an oath to place him on the throne after his father's death.</P>
<P>The pomp and magnificence of the ceremonies ob&s;erved at the king's funeral are very extraordina|ry. During the &s;ixty-five days that follow his de|cea&s;e he is &s;erved as if &s;till alive, and provi&s;ions are di&s;tributed among the bonzes and poor. The whole nation puts on mourning, and every one wears it according to his rank; the mandarins for three years, the king's hou&s;hold nine months, the noble&s;&s;e &s;ix, and the people three. During the&s;e three years no rejoicings are allowed, except at the coronation of the &s;ucceeding prince. The cu&s;tom
<PB N="148" REF="1480">
is to carry the body of the dead king into the de&s;erts lying beyond Bodego, which &s;tands two days jour|ney from Keco, ths capital of the kingdom; but as the king and all the court go thither on foot, it takes them up fifteen or &s;ixteen days. All the road is covered with &s;tuff of a violet colour, and at every quarter of a league there are places for refre&s;hment. The chouah takes care al&s;o that there &s;hall be lodg|ings for every day. In the mid&s;t of an immen&s;e and magnificent retinue of officers, hor&s;es, and ele|phants, is the chariot which carries the king's cof|fin, drawn by eight hor&s;es, trained for that purpo&s;e. After the corp&s;e comes to Bodego, it is put into a galley, and attended only by the &s;ix principal eu|nuchs of the court, who inter it in a remote place, after having bound them&s;elves by oath never to re|veal it. This &s;ecrecy is perhaps an article of reli|gion, or a precaution, to prevent the trea&s;ures that are buried with him from being carried off, which they imagine he may have occa&s;ion for in the other world. It is &s;aid that the princes and prince&s;&s;es or|der them&s;elves to be buried near him, out of a mo|tive of gratitude, and that they may continue to render him their &s;ervices.</P>
<P>After this funeral ceremony comes on the coro|nation of the new king, which diffu&s;es plea&s;ures and diver&s;ions over the city of Keco, and the country about. He is carried upon an elephant into the great court of the palace, which is covered with rich tape&s;tries in form of a tent; and there he re|ceives the oath of fidelity from the great men of the kingdom, to whom he makes a pre&s;ent of &s;eve|ral cakes of gold, and &s;mall bars of &s;ilver, the only money u&s;ed in this kingdom. Afterwards a large camp is erected, in the mid&s;t of a va&s;t plain, along the river Chale. The king goes thither, with all the officers of his hou&s;hold, and a great part of the army; and there receives the oaths of the de|puties
<PB N="149" REF="1490">
of his kingdom, and of the people. One half of the month pa&s;&s;es away in rejoicings; every day is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the diver&s;ity of fe&s;tivals, and the genero&s;ity of the prince: even the dark|ne&s;s of the night does not put a &s;top to them; for then the amu&s;ements of various &s;cenes of fireworks charm the &s;en&s;es, which are &s;aid to be infinitely finer and more curious than tho&s;e we have in Eu|rope.</P>
<P>This particular &s;pecies of ingenuity, as well as many others, are a con&s;equence of the emulation which the kings of Tonquin, like tho&s;e of China, have encouraged among their &s;ubjects. With a view to improve the arts and &s;ciences, nobility, with &s;uitable revenues, is the reward of tho&s;e who excel in the knowledge of the laws, mathematics, a&s;tronomy, and natural philo&s;ophy. Several days in the year are &s;et apart for the examination of tho&s;e who pre&s;ent them&s;elves, and &s;ometimes there are near three thou&s;and candidates. The king honours this ceremony with his pre&s;ence: he confers nobi|lity on tho&s;e who have given &s;atisfaction to the que&s;tions of the mandarins: he orders a robe of violet-&s;attin to be given them; and appoints the cities and villages which are to produce the reve|nues he is plea&s;ed to a&s;&s;ign them.</P>
<P>All the &s;tudy of the phy&s;icians here is to know the virtues of &s;imples, and to apply them for the cure of different di&s;tempers: they pretend to infal|lible remedies for &s;everal di&s;ea&s;es, thought to be in|curable in Europe: they make u&s;e of tea, which is brought from China and Japan, for pains in the head, the &s;tone, and cholic.</P>
<P>The language of the Tonquine&s;e, like the vulgar Chine&s;e or Fokyan dialect, con&s;i&s;ts of a va&s;t multi|tude of mono&s;yllables, who&s;e &s;ignifications are di|&s;tingui&s;hed by the various tones or accents with which they are pronounced. They write not only
<PB N="150" REF="1500">
in the &s;ame manner, viz. by columns, but with the &s;ame in&s;truments, and with paper made of &s;ilk or the barks of trees, as in China: their characters al|&s;o &s;eem to be the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The Tonquine&s;e are very ready and expert in mechanic arts, e&s;pecially in the &s;ilk and cotton ma|nufactures, and japanning. They have al&s;o ac|quired &s;ome &s;kill in working metals; and can even ca&s;t guns and other artillery, fabricate fire and other arms, with variety of other ingenious tools and uten&s;ils of metal.</P>
<P>The trade of this country is carried on almo&s;t entirely in foreign bottoms. The commodities exported from hence, be&s;ides tho&s;e mentioned above, are &s;altpetre, &s;ulphur, broad-cloths and other woollen &s;tuffs, &s;pices, lead, guns, and ca&s;h. We do not find that they have any coin of their own, but make u&s;e of that which is brought hither by &s;trangers, together with the &s;mall copper coin which they have from China. The Dutch merchants contract for temporary wives here, whom they make their factors, to buy up &s;ilk and other goods in their ab&s;ence, and employ the poor manufacturers, when they work cheape&s;t. Many of the Dutch rai&s;e e&s;tates by the traffic of their female factors, who are ob&s;erved to be very faithful, and are allowed &s;uch profits that they rai&s;e fortunes them&s;elves, and become matches for the greate&s;t lords in the country, when their Dutch hu&s;|bands have left off trading thither.</P>
<P>The mandarins and officers of &s;tate in the court of Tonquin are generally eunuchs, who keep, how|ever, great numbers of young girls to play with, and will frequently recommend them to the Euro|peans who trade thither, in hopes of having chil|dren by them.</P>
<P>The people of Tonquin are Pagans, and, among other animals, wor&s;hip the elephant and hor&s;e; and no people are more &s;uper&s;titious. They are
<PB N="151" REF="1510">
great pretenders to a&s;trology and the black art, and ob&s;ervers of times and &s;ea&s;ons, of lucky and unlucky days, as they give a name to every hour of the day; calling one the Lion, another the Ti|ger, the third a Hor&s;e, &amp;c. and the bea&s;t which de|nominates the hour any per&s;on happens to be born in is always avoided, under an apprehen&s;ion that that bea&s;t will &s;ome time prove fatal to them. The meeting a woman al&s;o, in their fir&s;t going out in a morning, is reckoned ominous: they will re|turn back on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, and not &s;tir out for &s;everal hours.</P>
<P>They are extremely &s;ollicitous to procure to them|&s;elves, whether poor or rich, the be&s;t coffins that their circum&s;tances will allow; and will, at any rate, make u&s;e of them, ten, twenty, or more years before-hand, and pre&s;erve them in their hou&s;es, as the mo&s;t valuable part of their furniture. A corp&s;e is commonly attired with the be&s;t garments the per&s;on wore when alive: that of a man has &s;even, and that of a woman nine, &s;uits of them, upon one another. They put &s;ome &s;mall pieces of gold or &s;ilver, or even &s;ome &s;mall pearls or pearl-&s;eed, in the mouths of the rich; and in tho&s;e of the poorer &s;ort, bits of copper, bra&s;s, bugles, or other trinkets, which they think will be of &s;ervice to them in the other world, and prevent them troubling the living with their complaints. It is likewi&s;e, with the &s;ame view, that they have &s;tated times to vi&s;it their graves, and offer variety of victuals, perfumes, pieces of gilt paper, and other &s;uch pre&s;ents, of which the &s;ouls, they think, come and take as much as they want.</P>
<P>At all kinds of public fe&s;tivals, which are fre|quent enough in this kingdom, the nobles are very fond of cock-fighting, a diver&s;ion much in vogue at court, in which they commonly bet very high; and great &s;ums are won and lo&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="1520">
According to the accounts of the popi&s;h mi&s;|&s;ionaries, they had made no fewer than eighty thou|&s;and converts in this kingdom, from the year 1620 to 1639. This &s;urprizing &s;ucce&s;s proved at length their ruin; for, after &s;everal dreadful per&s;ecutions, an edict was at la&s;t i&s;&s;ued by the king and council, anno 1721, by which the Chri&s;tian religion was ut|terly pro&s;cribed; the mi&s;&s;ionaries, with their cate|chi&s;ts and the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of their converts, impri&s;oned and put to &s;undry tortures, and even death; others condemned to attend the elephants, a &s;lavery wor&s;e than that of the gallies; their churches were all demoli&s;hed, or turned to profane u&s;es; the profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity was forbidden, under the &s;evere&s;t penalties; and all the frontiers and avenues ordered to be diligently guarded by the &s;oldiery, to prevent any more European preachers from ever entering the Tonquine&s;e dominions. All which was &s;o punctually executed, and &s;uch care hath been &s;ince taken to examine all &s;tran|gers, and &s;eize on all &s;u&s;picious per&s;ons, and to convey them under a &s;trong guard to the manda|rins of the provinces, and thence to the court, that no Je&s;uit or other mi&s;&s;ionary can attempt, under any di&s;gui&s;e or pretence, to get admittance into the kingdom.</P>
<P>Among the laws of this country, there is one in particular that is very laudable, and de&s;erves to be mentioned; namely, that which forbids, under &s;e|vere penalties, the expo&s;ing or drowning of their in|fants, an inhuman cu&s;tom, which has been practi&s;ed with impunity in China from time immemorial.</P>
<P>Every &s;ubject in Tonquin, be&s;ides the grandees and literati, above the age of eighteen, is obliged to pay the chouah a kind of land-tax, greater or le&s;s, according to his circum&s;tances, and the ferti|lity of his lands. Over and above this they are bound to an yearly &s;ervice, which con&s;i&s;ts in mend|ing
<PB N="153" REF="1530">
the highways, repairing the ramparts of towns and fortre&s;&s;es, the royal palaces, and other public &s;tructures; even trade&s;men and artificers are obliged to bear their &s;hare in this &s;ervice, which la&s;ts &s;ix months in the year, either in per&s;on, or hiring a &s;ub&s;titute, and all without any other &s;alary than a bare maintenance, and &s;ometimes even without that; it being in the chouah's option either to grant or refu&s;e it to them.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Tonquin is divided into eight provinces, or chief cantons, watered by &s;everal rivers, of which the principal is called Song-koy.</P>
<P>Of the towns the mo&s;t con&s;iderable are, Cachao, Chaco, Chico or Keco, Domea, and Heau. Cachao, the capital, and re&s;idence of the chouah, &s;tands in the heart of the kingdom, on the river Song-koy, un|der the 20th degree of north latitude, at about eighty leagues di&s;tance from the &s;ea. The town is large and populous; but, except the palace royal and the ar&s;enal, hath little worth notice. The former is more a va&s;t, than a &s;uperb &s;tructure; but the ar&s;enal is a large and noble building, and well furni&s;hed with warlike &s;tores and artillery. The hou&s;e belonging to the Engli&s;h is &s;ituated on the north-&s;ide of the city, fronting the river. It is a hand&s;ome, low built hou&s;e, with a &s;pacious dining|room in the centre, and on each &s;ide are the apart|ments of the merchants, factors, and &s;ervants. At each end of the building are &s;maller hou&s;es for other u&s;es, as &s;tore-hou&s;es, kitchen, &amp;c. Adjoin|ing to it, on the &s;outh &s;ide, is the Dani&s;h factory, which is neither &s;o large nor &s;o hand&s;ome.</P>
<P>Domea is a large &s;cattered town, or rather vil|lage, &s;ituated on the right &s;hore of the river of its name, which is a branch of the Song-koy, not far from its mouth. At the farther end of the Gulph of Tonquin there is a number of i&s;lands, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of which is that called by the Dutch,

The I&s;le of Robbers, where the Tonquine&s;e have &s;ettled a cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, which brings in about a million of rix-dollars.</P>
<P>A con&s;iderable variation is ob&s;erved in the tides on the Tonquine&s;e coa&s;ts from tho&s;e of Europe, the former ebbing and flowing but once in twenty-four hours. During two of the moon's quarters, the tide may be perceived to ri&s;e for the &s;pace of twelve hours, but can hardly be ob&s;erved during the other two quarters. In the &s;pring-tides, which la&s;t four|teen days, the waters begin to ri&s;e at the ri&s;ing of the moon; whereas, in the low-tides, which con|tinue the &s;ame number of days, the tide begins not till that planet has got below the horizon. Whil&s;t it is pa&s;&s;ing through the &s;ix northern &s;igns, the tides are ob&s;erved to vary very much, and to ri&s;e &s;ometimes very high, and &s;ometimes to be very low; but when it has got once into the &s;outhern part of the zodiac, they are found to be more even and regular.</P>

<P>HINDOSTAN, or the empire of the Great Mogul, or Mogol, is bounded on the north by Great and Little Tibet; on the ea&s;t by Tibet, and the Farther Penin&s;ula of the Indies; on the &s;outh by the Hither Penin&s;ula, part of the Indian Sea, and Bay of Bengal; and on the we&s;t by Per&s;ia. It is &s;ituated between the 84th and 102d degrees of longitude, and between the 21&s;t and 36th degrees of latitude; being in length about one thou&s;and two hundred and four miles, and in breadth nine hundred and &s;ixty, though in &s;ome parts not near &s;o much.</P>
<P>Towards the north Hindo&s;tan is very cold and barren, but towards the &s;outh very hot and fertile in corn, rice, fruits, and other vegetables. The
<PB N="156" REF="1560">
northern provinces are very mountainous and &s;andy, while the &s;outhern are, for the mo&s;t part, a very level country, and well watered with &s;everal rivers.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t remarkable mountains are tho&s;e which &s;urround it on three &s;ides. Tho&s;e on the we&s;t, &s;e|parating it from Per&s;ia, called, in general, Soley|man K&ucirc;h, or the mountains of Soleyman, are of a va&s;t height, as well as breadth, and are only pa&s;&s;aole in certain places, through which roads have been made for the &s;ake of commerce. The chief are tho&s;e which lead to Kabul, Gazna, and Kandahar. This great chain of mountains is in|habited by different nations, the principal of whom are the Afghans, or Patans, and the Baluches, who have extended them&s;elves on the &s;ide of India, as well as Per&s;ia. The mountains on the north are called Nagrakut, Hima, or M&ucirc;s T&acirc;g, which has an affinity with Ima&uuml;s, and by other names, which are given al&s;o in common to the mountains on each &s;ide, &s;eparating Hindo&s;tan from Tibet. The very pro&s;pect of the&s;e mountains is frightful, being no|thing but hideous precipices, perpetually covered with &s;now, and not to be cro&s;&s;ed without the greate&s;t danger and difficulty.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t remarkable rivers of Hindo&s;tan are the Indus and Ganges. The former is called by the Orientals Send, Sind, or Sindi. It ri&s;es in the mountains to the north, or north ea&s;t, of Hindo|&s;tan, whence, after a long cour&s;e, fir&s;t to the &s;outh and then to the &s;outh-we&s;t, it falls into the Per&s;ian &s;ea, below Lowre Bander, by &s;everal mouths. In its cour&s;e it receives &s;everal other large rivers, as the Nil&acirc;h, Jamal, Behat, and Lakka.</P>
<P>The Ganges, called in the Indies Ganga, ri&s;es in the kingdom of Tibet: entering Hindo&s;tan about the 30th degree of latitude, it runs fir&s;t &s;outh-ea&s;t|ward by the cities of Bek&acirc;ner, Minapor, Halabas,

<P>Many of the Jews and antient Chri&s;tians be|lieved this river to be the Pi&s;on, one of the four mentioned in &s;cripture, as the boundaries of the terre&s;trial Paradi&s;e. The Indians retain the greate&s;t reverence for its waters, going in crouds from the remote&s;t parts of the country to wa&s;h in them, from a per&s;ua&s;ion that they deface all the &s;pots of &s;in. The rea&s;on of this is, becau&s;e they imagine this river does not takes its &s;ource from the bo&s;om of the earth, but de&s;cends from heaven into the Paradi&s;e of Devendre, and from thence into Hin|do&s;tan. Nothing is more childi&s;h than the fa|bles of the bramins on this &s;ubject, yet the peo|ple &s;wallow them all. The mogul, and prince of Golconda, drink no other water than that of the Ganges: foreigners, on the contrary, pretend, that it is very unwhole&s;ome, and that it cannot be &s;afely drank, till it is fir&s;t boiled. There are a great number of &s;uperb pagodas on the banks of the Ganges, which are immen&s;ely rich. At certain fe&s;tivals, there has been &s;ometimes a concour&s;e of one hundred thou&s;and people who came to bathe in it. But what principally di&s;tingui&s;hes this river, be&s;ides its greatne&s;s and rapidity, is the gold it brings down in its &s;ands, and throws on its banks, and the precious &s;tones and pearls it produces, not only in it&s;elf, but in the Gulph of Bengal, into which it di&s;charges its waters, and which abound therewith. The Chun or Jemma, the Gudera&s;u, the Per&s;ilis, Lakia, and &s;everal other rivers, di&s;|charge them&s;elves into it during its cour&s;e.</P>

The weather and &s;ea&s;ons are, for the general, very regular in this &s;pacious country; the winds blowing con&s;tantly, for &s;ix months, from the &s;outh, and &s;ix from the north, with very little variation. The months of April, May, and the beginning of June, till the rains fall, are &s;o extremely hot, that the reflexion from the ground is apt to bli&s;ter one's face; and, but for the breeze, or &s;mall gale of wind, which blows every day, there would be no living in that country for people bred in northern climates; for, excepting in the rainy &s;ea&s;on, the colde&s;t day is hotter there at noon, than the hotte&s;t day in England: however, very &s;urpri&s;ing changes of heat and cold &s;ometimes happen within a few hours; &s;o that a &s;tifling hot day is &s;ucceeded by a night cold enough to produce a thin ice on the water; and that night by a noon as &s;corching as the preceding. Sometimes in the dry &s;ea&s;on, be|fore the rains, the winds blow with &s;uch extreme violence, that they carry va&s;t quantities of du&s;t and &s;and into the air, which appear black, like clouds charged with rain; but fall down in dry &s;howers, filling the eyes, ears, and no&s;trils of tho&s;e among whom they de&s;cend, and penetrate every che&s;t, cabinet, or cupboard, in the hou&s;es or tents, by the keyhole or crevices.</P>
<P>From Surat to Agra, and beyond, it &s;eldom or never rains, excepting in one &s;ea&s;on of the year; that is, from the middle of June to the middle of September. They generally begin and end with mo&s;t furious &s;torms of thunder and lightning. During the&s;e three months it rains u&s;ually every day, and &s;ometimes for a week together without intermi&s;&s;ion: by this means the land is enriched, like Egypt by the Nile. Although the land looks before like the barren &s;ands of the Arabian de&s;erts; yet, in a few days after tho&s;e &s;howers begin to fall, the &s;urface appears covered with verdure. When
<PB N="159" REF="1590">
the rainy &s;ea&s;on is over, the &s;ky becomes perfectly &s;erene again, and &s;carce one cloud appears all the nine months: however after, a refre&s;hing dew falls every night, during that dry interval, which cools the air, and cheri&s;hes the earth.</P>
<P>The produce of Hindo&s;tan is very rich in every kind, whether it be fo&s;&s;il, vegetable, or animal. Be&s;ides other precious &s;tones found in it, there is a diamond mine at the town of Soumelp&ucirc;r, in Ben|gal. Quarries of Theban &s;tone are &s;o plentiful in the mogul's empire, that there are both mo&s;ques and pagods built entirely of it. Some travellers tell us, there are mines of lead, iron, and copper, and even &s;ilver; but tho&s;e of the la&s;t, if there be any, need not be opened, &s;ince the bullion of all nations is &s;unk in this empire, which will take no|thing el&s;e in exchange for her commodities, and prohibits the exporting it again. They till the ground here with oxen and foot-ploughs, &s;owing in May and the beginning of June, that all may be over before the rains, and reaping in November and December, which with them is the mo&s;t tem|perate months in the year. The land is no where enclo&s;ed, excepting a little near towns and villages. The gra&s;s is never mowed to make hay, but cut off the ground, either green or whithered, as they have occa&s;ion to u&s;e it. Wheat, rice, barley, and other grain, grow here in plenty, and are very good. The country abounds no le&s;s in fruits, as pomegranates, citrons, dates, grapes, almonds, co|coa-nuts, plums, tho&s;e e&s;pecially called mirabolans; plantanes, which in &s;hape re&s;emble a &s;lender cu|cumber, and in ta&s;te excel a Norwich pear; man|gos, an excellent fruit, re&s;embling an apricot, but larger; ananas, which are like our pine-apples, and in ta&s;te &s;eem a compound of &s;traw-berries, claret, ro&s;e-water, and &s;ugar; lemons and oranges, but not &s;o good as in other countries; very good

water-melons and mu&s;k-melons, and variety of pears and apples in the northern parts.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the woods and groves, which adorn the country, you find trees &s;cattered over it, but none of the kinds known in England. Some bear leaves as broad as bucklers, and tho&s;e of others are &s;mall, and divided like the leaves of fern: of this kind is the tamarind tree, who&s;e fruit grows in a cod re|&s;embling that of beans. That which Europeans call the banian, or wax tree, grows to &s;uch a height, and &s;o wide, that &s;ome hundreds of men may &s;hade them&s;elves under it in any &s;ea&s;on, as the trees in the &s;outhern parts of India never &s;hed their leaves: but the valuable trees are the cotton and mulberry, on account of the wealth they bring the natives from the manufactures of callicoes and &s;ilks. There are many other kinds of fruit trees peculiar to the country. They plant abundance of &s;ugar-canes here, as well as tobacco; but the lat|ter is not &s;o rich and &s;trong as that of America, for want of knowing how to cure and order it.</P>
<P>Hindo&s;tan affords al&s;o plenty of ginger, toge|ther with carrots, potatoes, onions, garlick, and other roots known to us, be&s;ides &s;mall roots and herbs for &s;allads; but their flowers, though beau|tiful to look at, have no &s;cent, excepting ro&s;es, and &s;ome few other kinds.</P>
<P>There is a great variety of animals in this coun|try, both wild and tame; of the former are ele|phants, rhinocero&s;es, lions, tigers, leopards, wolves, jackals, and the like. The jackals dig up and eat dead bodies, and make a hideous noi&s;e in the night. The rhinoceros is not common in the mogol's em|pire, and has only one horn ju&s;t over the no&s;e, whence it has its name; but elephants are very nume|rous, &s;ome twelve, fourteen, or fifteen feet high. They are not without joints, as &s;ome have fabled, for they can lie down, and ri&s;e at plea&s;ure. They
<PB N="161" REF="1610">
walk &s;low, at mo&s;t three miles an hour; are very &s;ure footed, and exceeding tractable, as well as &s;en&s;ible. The &s;troke of his trunk, or probo&s;cis, will break the bones of a hor&s;e or camel, and even kill him outright. With it the elephant can like|wi&s;e pull up great trees by the roots, and at the command of his rider, who &s;its on his neck, take up dirt, du&s;t, or kennel water, and da&s;h in the face of any body.</P>
<P>There is plenty of veni&s;on, and game of &s;everal kinds, as red deer, fallow deer, elks, antelopes, kids, hares, and &s;uch like. None of the&s;e are imparked, but all in common, and may be any bodies, who will be at the pains to take them. Among the wild animals al&s;o may be reckoned the mu&s;k cat, apes, and monkies. The former is about the &s;ize of a hare, and the mu&s;k is contained in a kind of bladder, or pur&s;e, under the belly. The woods and groves are full of the latter.</P>
<P>Hindo&s;tan affords variety of bea&s;ts for carriage, as camels, dromedaries, mules, a&s;&s;es, hor&s;es, oxen, and buffaloes. Mo&s;t of the hor&s;es are white, and many curiou&s;ly dappled, pied, and &s;potted all over. The fle&s;h of the oxen is very &s;weet and tender. Being very tame, many u&s;e them as they do hor&s;es to ride on. In&s;tead of a bit, they put one or two &s;mall &s;trings through the gri&s;tle of the no&s;trils, and fa&s;tening the ends to a rope, u&s;e it in&s;tead of a bridle, which is held up by a bunch of gri&s;ly fle&s;h, which he has on the fore-part of his back. They &s;addle him as they do a hor&s;e, and, if &s;purred a lit|tle, will go as fa&s;t. The&s;e are generally made u&s;e of all over the Indies, and with them only are drawn waggons, coaches, and chariots. Some of the&s;e oxen will travel fifteen leagues in a day. They are of two &s;orts, one &s;ix feet high, which are rare; another called dwarfs, which are only three. In &s;ome places, where the roads are &s;tony, they &s;hoe
<PB N="162" REF="1620">
their oxen, when they are to travel far. The buf|falo's &s;kin makes excellent buff, and the female yields very good milk; but their fle&s;h is neither &s;o palatable nor whole&s;ome as beef. The &s;heep of Hindo&s;tan have large heavy tails, and their fle&s;h is very good, but their wool coar&s;e.</P>
<P>This country is much infe&s;ted with reptiles and in&s;ects, &s;ome of a noxious kind; as &s;corpions, &s;nakes, and rats; but the lizards, which are of a green colour, are not hurtful. The &s;ting of the &s;corpion, which re&s;embles a crayfi&s;h, and frequent|ly creeps into hou&s;es, is very painful, and even mortal, if the patient has not &s;ome pre&s;ent remedy, &s;uch as the oil of &s;corpions, which is a &s;ure and &s;udden cure.</P>
<P>Snakes and &s;erpents, we are told, are &s;ometimes u&s;ed to di&s;patch criminals, e&s;pecially &s;uch as have been guilty of &s;ome atrocious crime, that kind of death being attended with the mo&s;t grievous torture.</P>
<P>The rats here are very large and bold; they will &s;ometimes attack the fingers, toes, ears, no&s;es, and other parts of the body of tho&s;e in bed.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t trouble&s;ome in&s;ects in this hot coun|try are flies, mu&s;ketoes, and chinches, or bugs, the fir&s;t by day, and the others in the night, when they offend no le&s;s by their &s;tench than their bite.</P>
<P>Hindo&s;tan breeds plenty of peacocks, partridges, quails, gee&s;e, ducks, pullets, pigeons, doves, and variety of other good fowls; but there are no ca|pons here, be&s;ides the human. There is a &s;ort of hens, who&s;e &s;kin is perfectly black, but the fle&s;h very white and delicious, and the pigeons are all over green. The Indians are very dexterous at catching water-fowl; for &s;wimming after them, with a pot on their head, covered with feathers, they pull tho&s;e they come up with under water by the feet.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="1630">
There are two kinds of bats in this country, one like tho&s;e in Europe, the other of a &s;ingular make; for it has a body as big as that of a duck, with the head and ears of a cat, a &s;nout like that of a great rat, ears pricked up, wings almo&s;t two feet long, and &s;even or eight inches broad, with four legs or arms, terminating in five fingers, much like the human, only in&s;tead of nails they have claws. The&s;e bats have no tails, but under the wings appear two teats, as big as the ends of one's little finger.</P>
<P>Among the birds which frequent the woods, there is a &s;pecies le&s;s than wrens, which delight the ear no le&s;s with the variety of their notes, than the eye with their beauty. Their ne&s;ts hang like pur&s;e nets from &s;lender twigs, at the extremity of the boughs, out of the reach of the &s;malle&s;t monkies.</P>
<P>Not only fle&s;h but fi&s;h are very cheap all over India, which is owing, in a great mea&s;ure, to the Hind&ucirc;s not eating animal food. Of the rivers, however, many are infe&s;ted with crocodiles.</P>
<P>The &s;everal &s;orts of INHABITANTS of HINDOSTAN, their PERSONS, DRESS, RELIGION, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Hindo&s;tan is inhabited by &s;everal different kinds of people, as the Hind&ucirc;s, the P&acirc;tans or Afghans, the Baluchis, the Par&s;is, and the Mogols or Tar|tars, be&s;ides foreigners, e&s;pecially Jews and Chri|&s;tians of various &s;ects.</P>
<P>The Hind&ucirc;s are the antient inhabitants, and though &s;ubject to the Mogols, are, at lea&s;t, &s;ome hundreds to one, compared with all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The Par&s;is are the de&s;cendants of the antient Per|&s;ians, who wor&s;hipped the fire. The&s;e fled from India to avoid the per&s;ecution of the Mohammedans, and are &s;ettled on the we&s;tern Penin&s;ula, chiefly about Surat.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="1640">
The Patans, or Afghans, for they &s;eem to be the &s;ame people under different names, are tho&s;e from whom the Mogols conquered Hindo&s;tan. They are &s;till very numerous, chiefly in the moun|tains and north-we&s;t parts, towards Kabul, Ghazna, and Khandahar, from whence, in all probability, they originally came. They are a fierce and war|like people, and have a great aver&s;ion to the Mo|guls for having di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them of their territories.</P>
<P>The Baluchis, a barbarous people, and much given to rapine, po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;everal parts of Hindo|&s;tan to the we&s;t of the Indus, particularly the pro|vince of Hajakh&acirc;n. Both they and the Afghans al&s;o po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;everal parts of Per&s;ia.</P>
<P>The Mogols, or Jagatays, are the pre&s;ent lords of Hindo&s;tan, where they reign over the re&s;t, for the mo&s;t part, with an ab&s;olute &s;way.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e &s;everal nations, the Hind&ucirc;s and Par&s;is are Pagan; but excel all the re&s;t in mode&s;t deport|ment, and the practice of virtue. The Patans, Ba|luchis, and Mogols, are Mohammedans, and the fir&s;t and la&s;t pretty &s;trict ob&s;ervers of the law and the rules of ju&s;tice, at lea&s;t among them&s;elves.</P>
<P>It is rare to &s;ee a crooked or deformed per&s;on, an idiot or natural fool in Hindo&s;tan. As to the complexion of the natives, they are of a deep tawny or olive colour; their hair jet black, but not curled. They like not people who are very white or fair, becau&s;e that is the colour of lepers, who are com|mon in tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the Mohammedans, except their prie&s;ts and antient men, keep their chins con&s;tantly &s;haven, but let the hair on their upper lip grow very long. They &s;have their heads all over, leaving only a lock on the crown; by which they expect to be drawn up to heaven by their prophet Mohammed. In&s;tead of hats or bonnets, they wear a kind of
<PB N="165" REF="1650">
turban, con&s;i&s;ting of a piece of narrow callico, wound &s;everal times about the head. The inhabi|tants, in general, are very civil and courteous, as well to &s;trangers as one another. They &s;alute by bowing the head, or their body, laying the right hand on their brea&s;t, and uttering compliments as they pa&s;s. The meaner people &s;alute their &s;upe|riors in a very &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive manner, either by put|ting their right hand to the ground, and then lay|ing it on their head; or el&s;e by falling on their knees, and then bowing their head to the earth. In their more familiar &s;alutations, they take each other by the chin, or beard, and cry B&acirc;ba, father, or Bij, brother.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of the inhabitants of Hindo&s;tan is all the &s;ame in great and &s;mall, rich and poor, differ|ing only in co&s;t; for they never alter their fa&s;hions. Their upper-coats to the wai&s;t &s;it clo&s;e to their bo|dies, whence they hang loo&s;e a little below their knees. Under this out-coat, they u&s;ually wear another &s;light one of the &s;ame cloth, but &s;horter, in the nature of a ve&s;t. Some of the richer &s;ort in the cooler parts of the day, &s;lip on loo&s;e coats over the other, made of quilted &s;ilk, or callico, or el&s;e of Engli&s;h &s;carlet cloth, for that is the colour they mo&s;t affect. Under their coats they wear a &s;ort of trow&s;ers, which fall down to their ancles, and ruffle on the &s;mall of their legs: for their feet are always bare in their &s;hoes, but as clean as their hands. They have girdles, made of a long piece of cloth, which go twice at lea&s;t about them, the ends hanging down.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of the Mohammedan women differs but little from that of the men, only they bind their hair with long fillets, which hang down behind, and wear on their heads mantles or vails of callico; all round their ears they wear &s;mall pendants made of thin and narrow pieces of gold or &s;ilver, bra&s;s or
<PB N="166" REF="1660">
iron, according to the quality of the per&s;on. The lower part of their left no&s;tril is al&s;o pierced for putting in rings of tho&s;e metals, at plea&s;ure; the ends of their gold rings meeting in a pearl, drilled for that purpo&s;e. Some of the better &s;ort wear great hollow rings of gold enamelled, &s;ilver, or bra&s;s, upon their wri&s;ts, and the &s;mall of their legs, two or three on each limb, which makes a tinkling when they move.</P>
<P>The Mohammedans are very temperate in their diet. They &s;tew all their fle&s;h, cut into &s;lices or &s;mall pieces, putting to it onions, herbs, roots, green ginger, and other &s;pices, with &s;ome butter, which makes a me&s;s exceeding palatable; but their common di&s;h is rice, which they boil, and &s;ea&s;on with ginger, pepper, and butter. Sometimes they make pillaw, by boiling pieces of veni&s;on, mutton, or fowls, in their rice.</P>
<P>Their butter is very good, being cream-beaten to a kind of thick oil; and they have chee&s;e, made of the milk of cows, goats, &s;heep, and buffaloes. Their bread, both of wheat and other grain, is baked on &s;mall round iron hearths, or plates, in the form of oaten cakes.</P>
<P>The common drink, both of the natives and &s;trangers in Hindo&s;tan, is water, which is found to agree better with their bodies, than any other liquid. There is a liquor called toddi, drawn from a tree by making inci&s;ions in the branches, which is plea&s;ant and whole&s;ome, if drank &s;oon after it is extracted. A liquor di&s;tilled from &s;u|gar, and the &s;picy rind of a tree called jagra, by the Indians &s;tiled raak or arak, is al&s;o u&s;ed, but in no great quantity. Although there are excellent grapes, the Mohammedans make no wine, nor drink any, &s;uch at lea&s;t as are &s;trict ob&s;ervers of their religion, but u&s;e coffee in&s;tead of it. They chew al&s;o the leaf of a &s;hrub, called betel or pawne,
<PB N="167" REF="1670">
together with a hard nut, &s;haped like a nutmeg, and a little pure lime mixed with the leaves.</P>
<P>The Mohammedans in this country are married by the mullah or prie&s;t, with much the &s;ame ceremo|nies as el&s;ewhere. After making a proce&s;&s;ion thro' the principal parts of the city with mu&s;ic, the man, with his relations and friends, on hor&s;eback, and the bride, with her women, in covered coaches, they return to the hou&s;e of the married couple, where they are entertained. Although the Mo|hammedans are allowed four wives, very few, and tho&s;e only of the richer &s;ort, take more than one. They are &s;o jealous that they will not &s;uffer either father or brother to &s;peak to their wives, unle&s;s in their pre&s;ence. Adultery and fornication are rec|koned &s;o criminal, that rather than the offender &s;hall e&s;cape puni&s;hment, their own brother will not &s;cruple to take away their lives; for which barba|rity, in&s;tead of being called to account, they will be commended. Great men have eunuchs to guard their women. Common pro&s;titutes are tolerated here: but they mu&s;t be licen&s;ed, before they are at liberty to open a hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The women are exceeding happy in this part of the world in having ea&s;y labours; for it is com|mon to &s;ee them one day riding big with child, and the next day riding again with the infants in their arms. The children of the poorer &s;ort go naked &s;everal years, only now and then their mo|ther's cover them with a &s;light callico mantle.</P>
<P>The Mohammedans bury not in their mo&s;ques or churches, but in &s;ome open place out of town.</P>
<P>Their mourning over the decea&s;ed is immode|rate, e&s;pecially at their graves; when they often a&s;k the party, as if living, Why he would die, &s;ince he had &s;uch loving wives and friends, and other com|forts in this life. The men of the greate&s;t quality often provide fair &s;epulchres for them&s;elves and friends. There are al&s;o many hand&s;ome monu|ments
<PB N="168" REF="1680">
erected in memory of &s;uch as they e&s;teem pirs, or &s;aints; which are much re&s;orted to by de|vout people, having lamps continually burning in them, with votaries, who have &s;alaries to attend them. The Mohammedans be&s;tow not &s;o much co&s;t on any &s;ort of &s;tructures as on &s;epulchres.</P>
<P>The common language of the empire, called the Hind&ucirc;&s;t&acirc;n, has a great affinity with the Per&s;ian and Arabic, but more &s;mooth, and very &s;ignifi|cant and conci&s;e. Its characters are different from tho&s;e of the above languages, and written from the left hand to the right, like the European. All the learning of the moguls con&s;i&s;ts in reading and wri|ting; however, the people them&s;elves are men of very &s;trong rea&s;on, and will &s;peak off hand, on any &s;ubject, exceeding well. Their chief &s;tudy is a&s;tro|logy, with the belief of which the generality are &s;trangely infatuated; the great mogul him&s;elf un|dertaking nothing of any moment, without con&s;ult|ing his a&s;trologers.</P>
<P>The religion of the Moguls, A&s;ghans, and Pa|tans, is the Mohammedan, of the Sunni &s;ect, &s;uch as the Turks are of, who hold Abubekr for the true &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Mohammed, in oppo&s;ition to the Shiya, who acknowledge Ali in that quality, as the Per|&s;ians do. As to the number of the Mohammedans, compared with the Pagans, there are, at lea&s;t, an hundred, if not &s;everal hundreds, of the latter, to one of the former. Both Mohammedans and Pagans here are &s;o &s;trict in the practice of their re|ligion, that they will rather die than eat or drink any thing that their law forbids; and what they do, of either kind, is for the mo&s;t part merely to &s;up|port nature. The Mohammedans here, as el&s;e|where, are very charitable, building inns in towns, and making wells and ci&s;terns for the public u&s;e: &s;ome of them even keep &s;ervants on the highways,
<PB N="169" REF="1690">
with water in great &s;kins, carried by buffaloes, to refre&s;h pa&s;&s;engers and their bea&s;ts, at free co&s;t.</P>
<P>The Mohammedan dervi&s;hes, or monks, &s;pend their lives in &s;olitude and contemplation, retiring to the tops of hills, &s;haded with trees, whence they ne|ver afterwards &s;tir. They never cea&s;e crying out, "God Almighty look upon me; I love not the world, but thee, and do all this for thy &s;ake." Cloaths and victuals are &s;ent them; for, after their retirement, they will &s;ooner die than go out of their cells, letting their hair and nails grow to their full extent.</P>
<P>Another &s;ort of penitents, called fak&icirc;rs, practi&s;e great au&s;terities, wearing nothing but what is &s;uf|ficient to cover their nakedne&s;s, begging for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, lying in the a&s;hes all night, and often wearing iron fetters on their legs, &s;o heavy that they can &s;carce move with them; yet, covered with a blue mantle, which is the mourning colour, walk many miles, as fa&s;t as they can, barefoot, on the &s;corching ground, in pilgrimage to the tombs of their &s;aints. Sometimes they take intoxicating drugs, which make them talk wildly; and that draws the common people about them, who mi&s;take &s;uch jargon for prophecy.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal &s;orts of fak&icirc;rs, which are &s;aid to make no fewer than eight hundred thou&s;and alto|gether, be&s;ides twelve millions of idolatrous men|dicants or penitents, called joghis, who are all va|gabonds and lazy drones, impo&s;ing on the credulous multitude by a fal&s;e zeal, and a non&s;en&s;ical jargon, which pa&s;&s;es on them for oracles. One &s;ort of the&s;e fak&icirc;rs marry; and &s;ome have three or four wives, thinking they do God great &s;ervice, in be|getting many children to be followers of his law, as they account the koran. All religions are tole|rated in Hindo&s;tan, and the people treat the clergy of all per&s;ua&s;ions with much re&s;pect.</P>

As to the Pagan Hind&ucirc;s or Hindows, they are divided into four great tribes or orders of people, viz. 1. The men of the law or the prie&s;thood, called br&acirc;hmans, brammans, or bramins: 2. The men of arms, to which belong their rajahs or kings; the&s;e are al&s;o called by &s;ome &s;ettreas, and by others ketteris, katri, and kutteris: 3. The merchants or men of traffic, called, by different travellers, wey|nias, vanias, baneans or baniyans, be&s;ku, &s;hudde|ris, &s;oudr, and kourmi: 4. The commonalty, in which are included mechanics, hu&s;bandmen, and all inferior kinds of people, called al&s;o by the &s;e|veral names of &s;owdras, &s;idra, wi&s;e, and wens. The&s;e four principal cla&s;&s;es are again &s;ubdivided into &s;everal &s;ubordinate cla&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The bramins are held in great veneration among the Hind&ucirc;s, becau&s;e the Ved&acirc;m or book of the law, which the Hind&ucirc;s hold to be &s;ent from God, was delivered to them; and that they are the keep|ers of it. This book orders, that a bramin &s;hall not be put to death for any crime he commits, how atrocious &s;oever; but his puni&s;hment is to be lo&s;s of his &s;ight. On the other hand, it is reckoned one of the greate&s;t &s;ins in nature to kill a bramin, not to be expiated by le&s;s than a twelve years pil|grimage. In &s;ome parts of India, as on the coa&s;t of Malabar, bramins are kings; and in other coun|tries, governors of provinces and cities. Their tribe is much the &s;ame among the Hind&ucirc;s, as that of Levi was among the Jews.</P>
<P>The &s;econd tribe or the kuttereys, properly con|&s;i&s;ts of the nobility or grandees, called rajahs, who have a chief or king, &s;tiled rajah of rajahs, and the god of the rajahs; which is to be under&s;tood of the king of Bi&s;nagar or Nar&s;inga, in Karnatika or Kar|nata.</P>
<P>The office of the nobles is to govern and defend the country again&s;t enemies. Some of them being
<PB N="171" REF="1710">
left poor, are obliged, for a livelihood, to &s;erve the richer lords; and the&s;e are they who are called r&acirc;|jap&ucirc;ts, or corruptly r&acirc;&s;p&ucirc;ts, that is, children of the rajahs. The Hind&ucirc;s of this tribe eat the fle&s;h of all &s;orts of animals, except the cow. Antiently, during their flouri&s;hing &s;tate, they were the &s;ove|reigns and rulers in India, e&s;pecially that part call|ed Guzerat, and were &s;tiled rajahs, which &s;ignifies kings. In proce&s;s of time, &s;ome of them yielded to the Mohammedans, who invaded them; others, retiring to inacce&s;&s;ible places on the borders of the country, there fixed them&s;elves, and remain to this day: from thence they make incur&s;ions into the neighbouring territories, rob the kaffilas on the high roads, and &s;ometimes advance to the &s;kirts of the &s;tronge&s;t as well as mo&s;t populous cities, attended with their rajahp&ucirc;ts: many of them &s;till maintain an independency in the heart of the empire, and can bring into the field con&s;iderable bodies of rajahp&ucirc;ts, to whom they allot lands, on condition of being al|ways ready, at their command, to appear on hor&s;e|back. The more powerful rajahs the great mogul always employs, in order to &s;ecure their loyalty and attachment, by keeping them in his &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The &s;huderi weynjas, vanias, or baniyans, all follow merchandize, or are brokers for merchants. Baniyans, in the bramins language, wherein their law is written, &s;ignifies an innocent and harmle&s;s people, as they really are; for they cannot bear to &s;ee a fly, worm, or any other thing, hurt; and, if they receive a blow, take it patiently, without re|turning it. Their law having a greater re&s;emblance to that of the bramins, than tho&s;e of the other tribes, they follow their injunctions much more &s;trictly, and live much in the &s;ame manner, eating no kind of animal food.</P>
<P>The wi&s;es or &s;owdras, at pre&s;ent, are commonly called gentiles or gentews, and are divided into two
<PB N="172" REF="1720">
&s;orts, the pure and the impure. This latter kind, called vi&s;&s;erawn, and of which are the hu&s;bandmen, called kowl&icirc;s or k&ucirc;l&icirc;s, take great liberty in their diet, eating animal food, either fi&s;h or fle&s;h: on the contrary, the purer gentiles, who are the handi|craft&s;men, follow the rule of the baniyans as to diet, ab&s;taining both from fle&s;h and wine, or u&s;ing them but &s;eldom. With regard to their handi|crafts, it is ob&s;ervable, that they employ as few tools as may be, and that their method of working is in every re&s;pect contrary to that of the Europeans. This tribe is the mo&s;t numerous of the four, com|pri&s;ing the hu&s;bandmen, mechanics, manufacturers, labourers, porters, and tho&s;e de&s;tined to the mo&s;t &s;ervile offices.</P>
<P>The perreas or pareas may be called a fifth tribe, di&s;tinct from the other four, among whom they are not thought worthy to be ranked, or &s;uffered to dwell; &s;o that they live by them&s;elves, either in the out-&s;kirts of the towns, or in country villages. They get their bread by &s;owing, digging, building the hou&s;es of the common people, cleaning the hou&s;es of office, &s;weeping the &s;treets and hou&s;es, and doing &s;uch kind of dirty work as others do not care to meddle with. Nor is their diet much more cleanly; for they do not &s;cruple to eat crows, hor&s;es, fowls, or other carrion, which die of them|&s;elves, and even &s;tink. At Surat they are called halalchors, that is eat-alls, or eaters at large, for the rea&s;ons above-mentioned. Nothing can offend the other Hind&ucirc;s more than to be called a halal|chor; yet the&s;e poor people take all in good part, cringe and bow to all that pa&s;s, and go through their drudgery without noi&s;e or con|cern.</P>
<P>The Hindows in general are extremely &s;ober, and never commit any exce&s;s, either in eating or drinking, nor any &s;ort of indecency. They are
<PB N="173" REF="1730">
very charitable to the poor; nay, their charity extends even to birds and bea&s;ts, for whom they build ho&s;pitals. In a pagod at Surat, Thevenot tells us, he &s;aw a man di&s;tributing flower among ants, leaving a handful wherever he found any. It is an inviolable law, that all relations mu&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;t one another, and &s;hare the little they po&s;&s;e&s;s with tho&s;e who are in want. They are of a very mild di&s;po&s;ition; &s;o that nothing &s;hocks them more than anger, and a ha&s;ty temper. This is particularly re|markable in the baniyans, owing to the abhorrence which they have to the &s;hedding of blood. A ba|niyan will bear almo&s;t any thing, without emotion, except a &s;troke with a &s;lipper, after a per&s;on has taken it off his foot and &s;pit on it, which is looked on as no le&s;s ignominious than &s;pitting in the face, and throwing dirt, among us. The baniyans, how|ever, are extremely covetous, and greedy of gain; and &s;ome of them a ma&s;s a prodigious trea&s;ure, in ca&s;h and jewels. They are particularly remarkable for their tenderne&s;s to brute animals; of which the Mohammedans, and &s;ometimes even Chri&s;tians, take advantage, threatening, in pre&s;ence of a ba|niyan, to kill &s;ome bird or other creature, in order to extort money for its redemption. Their darling animal is the calf, who&s;e life they &s;eldom fail to ran&s;om. If a baniyan happens to kill but a mite or a flea, the offence mu&s;t be expiated by &s;ome con|&s;iderable atonement. If they &s;ee a per&s;on going to &s;hoot a bird, they immediately run as for life, and, with a rupee or two, bribe the fowler to de&s;i&s;t, and not defile the ground with blood. They have ho&s;pi|tals for cows, hor&s;es, goats, dogs, and other di&s;ea&s;ed, lame, or decayed creatures. Once a-year, they pre|pare a &s;et banquet for all the flies in their hou&s;es, of &s;weet-milk and &s;ugar mixed: nay, they have even ho&s;pitals for fleas, bugs, and other vermin. This their great care of, and humanity to animals, is
<PB N="174" REF="1740">
owing chiefly to their belief of the metemp&s;ycho&s;is, or tran&s;migration of &s;ouls; yet they &s;hew al&s;o a particular regard for trees.</P>
<P>The Hind&ucirc;s, in general, are of a low and timo|rous &s;pirit, except the r&acirc;jahp&ucirc;ts, but very faithful, hone&s;t, and diligent. As they &s;have their own heads all over, and mo&s;t of their beards, they make excellent barbers. Their implements con&s;i&s;t of a razor, not an inch long; a bra&s;s ba&s;on, no bigger than a coffee-di&s;h; and a piece of hard &s;oap. They will &s;have one, pick and clear his ears, and pare his nails, all for a gorb&icirc;ck, which is much un|der a farthing. The Hind&ucirc;s often wa&s;h and anoint them&s;elves. For the latter purpo&s;e, the better &s;ort u&s;e &s;weet oils, but the poorer cocoa-nut oil.</P>
<P>All the different tribes of Hind&ucirc;s are di&s;tingui&s;h|ed from one another by the cut of their beards, and the different paintings of their bodies and fore|heads, as well as the form of their turbans.</P>
<P>The male Hind&ucirc;s are tall, and large-boned: their colour varies according to the different parts they inhabit. The women are &s;mall and &s;hort, in re&s;pect of the men; but generally neat and well|&s;haped, though plump. They are cleanly, both in their cockery and bodies; plucking up the hair by the roots, in every part, excepting their heads. The main co&s;t of the Hind&ucirc;s, e&s;pecially the baniyans, are expended on their wives, of whom tho&s;e of the rich have their hair, arms, legs, no&s;es, ears, fingers, and toes, adorned with gold, &s;ilver, and jewels; and tho&s;e of the poorer &s;ort with rings, and trin|kets of gla&s;s, bra&s;s, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The women &s;cruple no more than the men, to do their occa&s;ions in the public &s;treets, or high|ways. This makes it di&s;agreeable, at lea&s;t to &s;trangers, to take the air, either in the &s;treets or without their towns, near the rivers and ditches. The men otherwi&s;e very cleanly, always &s;having
<PB N="175" REF="1750">
their heads and beards, cutting their nails, wa&s;hing their mouths and other parts of their bodies, and rubbing their teeth, whereby they look like ivory. The men &s;quar, like the women, when they make water.</P>
<P>The Hind&ucirc;s are very indu&s;trious; for it is they that till the ground, plant, &s;ow, and breed the cat|tle, and al&s;o make and &s;ell all the manufactures of the country.</P>
<P>The bramins and baniyans feed only on vegeta|bles, milk-meats, fruits, and &s;weet-meats; but the other tribes eat animal food. The only drink of the baniyans is rain, well, or river water, with tea and coffee. They never touch &s;trong liquors.</P>
<P>The Hind&ucirc;s never drink out of the &s;ame cup with any Chri&s;tian, or any per&s;on of a different tribe, nor will defile their lips with water which has been touched by a &s;tranger; for this rea&s;on, they generally carry with them jars of water when they go abroad.</P>
<P>Their times of eating are eight or nine in the morning, and at four or five in the afternoon; and the heat of the day is &s;pent in re&s;t and &s;leeping.</P>
<P>The Indians are in many things of matchle&s;s in|genuity, and admirable imitators of whatever they copy, though their tools are very &s;imple and cheap. Their &s;ilk-weavers, &s;hip-carpenters, and tailors, are very ingenious. The painting of their chintz, the gold &s;tripes, in their &s;oo&s;eys, the gold flowers in their alla&s;&s;es, and the cornelian rings, with double chains of gold about them, meeting at &s;everal di&s;|tances, where &s;parks of diamonds, rubies, or &s;ap|phires, are &s;et for ornament, &s;urpa&s;s the &s;kill of any other nation. The artificers of Bengal are &s;ur|prizingly &s;kilful; particularly the gold&s;miths, in fillagree and other works, and the weavers in the &s;ilks and fine linens, &s;o much &s;ought after in all parts of the world. Their ma&s;ons, chymi&s;ts,
<PB N="176" REF="1760">
and painters, are al&s;o &s;aid to be very ingenious. What helps much to perfect the mechanics and manufacturers in their &s;everal profe&s;&s;ions is, that among the Mohammedans, as well as Pagans, eve|ry one breeds up his children to his own trade and occupation, and never to any other.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to learning and the &s;ciences, the culture and care of which the bramins claim wholly to them&s;elves, the Hind&ucirc;s are &s;aid to have a genius for poetry, allegory, and fable; but to be little ac|quainted with the rules of true eloquence, and too fond of the marvellous to make good hi&s;torians. The bramins have cultivated all the parts of the mathematics, nor is algebra unknown to them; but a&s;tronomy, or rather a&s;trology, was always the principal object of their mathematical &s;tudies, be|cau&s;e the &s;uper&s;tition, as well of the grandees as of the common people, made it turn mo&s;t to their profit.</P>
<P>An ob&s;ervatory, not a great many years ago, was built at Dehli, by rajah Jae&s;ing, who may be &s;tiled the re&s;torer of Indian a&s;tronomy. Their know|ledge of logic, metaphy&s;ics, and phy&s;iology, is no|thing but a heap of dreams and chimeras: the &s;ole end to which all the philo&s;ophic enquiries of the bramins tend, is the moukti, or deliverance of the &s;oul from the captivity and mi&s;eries of this life, by a perfect felicity. This is a con&s;equence of their notions with regard to the tran&s;migration of &s;ouls. With regard to morality, or moral philo&s;ophy, they have a very fine &s;y&s;tem; which is compri&s;ed in &s;en|tentious ver&s;es, like tho&s;e of Cato.</P>
<P>Many of the bramins &s;tudy phy&s;ic, and there are &s;everal little books, containing collections of re|cipes in ver&s;e; but though their practice is very different from that of European phy&s;icians, it is of|ten very &s;ucce&s;sful. For all this, the Hind&ucirc;s un|der&s;tand
<PB N="177" REF="1770">
nothing of anatomy, never opening the body either of man or bea&s;t.</P>
<P>Touching a&s;tronomy, they have their tables, ac|cording to which they calculate eclip&s;es, pretty nearly as exact as the Europeans, but their theory is very ab&s;urd: as an in&s;tance of this, they &s;ay, that eclip&s;es are occa&s;ioned by a daemon's &s;eizing the &s;un and moon, and blackening them with ink.</P>
<P>In geography the bramins are no better &s;killed than in a&s;tronomy; their notions in regard to the figure, and other circum&s;tances of the earth, being altogether ab&s;urd and ridiculous.</P>
<P>From the above brief account of the learning of the modern bramins it appears, that, if that of the antient was of the &s;ame &s;tamp, many have been deceived in the high opinion they have entertained of them.</P>
<P>The city of Bern&acirc;res or Warana&s;i, called al&s;o Ka&s;i or K&acirc;&s;hi, &s;ituated in Bengal, on the river Ganges, is the principal univer&s;ity, and, as it were, the Athens of the Hind&ucirc;s. Here the bramins teach their di&s;ciples (not in colleges, but in their hou&s;es and gardens) fir&s;t, the Han&s;krit or San&s;krit, but more properly the Sam&s;kortam or Sam&s;krou|tam language, in which their Ved&acirc;m or &s;acred books are written, being very different from the common Indian, and known only to the doctors; then, the Puran, or interpretation of the vedam or beths. After the Puran, &s;ome &s;tudy philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>The Hind&ucirc;s never marry out of the tribe to which they belong: in like manner, the children are always bred to the father's bu&s;ine&s;s. No man has more than one wife at a time. They marry at &s;ix or &s;even years of age, and bed by fifteen at farthe&s;t, often at thirteen. To die unmarried is reckoned among the greate&s;t misfortunes. Their marriages are &s;olemnized, like the Mohammedan, with much company, noi&s;e, and &s;hew. The cere|mony
<PB N="178" REF="1780">
it&s;elf is thus performed: a fire is fir&s;t kind|led, and placed between the parties to be married, to intimate the ardency that ought to be in their affections; then both are inclo&s;ed with a &s;ilken &s;tring, to denote the indi&s;&s;oluble bond of matri|mony; after this, a cloth is put between them, to &s;ignify that before marriage there ought to be no intimacy between them: this done, the bramins pronounce a certain form of words, enjoining the man to allow the woman all things convenient for her, and charging the woman to be faithful to her hu&s;band; then, pronouncing a ble&s;&s;ing upon them that they may be fruitful, the cloth is taken away, and the &s;ilken &s;tring unloo&s;ed, which put an end to the ceremony. No woman may marry a &s;econd time, unle&s;s &s;he is of the tribe of Wi&s;e or Weyz; but the men of all tribes may marry twice, except that of the bramins. In marriage, all are confined to their own tribe; and the Wi&s;es not only to their own tribe, but to per&s;ons of their own bu&s;ine&s;s, as the &s;on of a barber to the daughter of a barber, and &s;o of the re&s;t. All the tribes, except the bra|mins, baptize thus: the child having been wa&s;hed in water, one of the relations, holding the point of a pen towards his forehead, prays that God would write good things therein; then tho&s;e pre&s;ent &s;ay a men, and give the infant its name; la&s;tly, the bramin makes a mark in his forehead with red ointment, in token of admi&s;&s;ion into their church, and the ceremony is ended. The bapti&s;m of a bramin's child differs a little from that of the other tribes, particularly in his being anointed. The cradles for children are hung in the air, to a beam or po&s;t, by &s;trings tied to each end, and &s;o &s;wing to and fro by the &s;lighte&s;t touch.</P>
<P>On the death of any friend, the baniyans make co&s;tly fea&s;ts, for two or three days following; then
<PB N="179" REF="1790">
they ob&s;erve the twelfth, twentieth, thirtieth, and fortieth days after, be&s;ides one day every quarter, until the annual &s;olemnity returns. The generali|ty of the Hind&ucirc;s, in&s;tead of burying, burn their dead, by the &s;ide of &s;ome river appropriated to &s;uch purpo&s;e. When the corp&s;e is con&s;umed, they &s;cat|ter the a&s;hes in the air, while the bramin repeats a form of words; after which, he reads to the near|e&s;t relation the law of mourners, importing, that for ten days he mu&s;t neither chew betel, oil his head, nor put on clean cloaths; al&s;o, that for a whole year, every month, on the day of his father's decea&s;e, he mu&s;t make a fea&s;t, and pay a vi&s;it to the river which received his parent's a&s;hes. Sometimes, in|&s;tead of burning, they only broil the body, and then throw it into the river; nay, &s;ometimes burn the body, or plunge it into water, before it is quite dead. When a great man dies, one or more of his wives is obliged to burn her&s;elf, to honour his funeral; and &s;ometimes the wives of the&s;e and others do it voluntarily, dre&s;&s;ed not only in their be&s;t ornaments, as if it was their wedding-day, but &s;inging and dancing about the pit, where the pile is erected: &s;ome, however, di&s;cover great dread and horror, and the&s;e the bramins generally force in|to the flames. If any of them, after &s;etting out, make their e&s;cape, they are never received again among them, being accounted infamous. In &s;ome places, in&s;tead of burning tho&s;e women who are willing to die, upon the death of their hu&s;bands, they bury them alive in the ground, up to the very throat, and then wring off their heads.</P>
<P>As for the Par&s;is, they go dre&s;&s;ed like the other people of India; only they &s;uffer their beards to grow long. Their profe&s;&s;ion is chiefly agriculture, planting, &s;owing, and dre&s;&s;ing of vines; in &s;hort, all &s;orts of trees, particularly the palmeto or toddy|tree. They live mo&s;tly in the country about Surat,
<PB N="180" REF="1800">
where many of them apply them&s;elves al&s;o to weaving of &s;ilks and &s;tuffs. They are very &s;ober and ab&s;temious; and, to avoid giving offence ei|ther to the Mohammedans or Hind&ucirc;s, eat neither pork nor beef. The cock is no le&s;s e&s;teemed by them than the cow by the Hind&ucirc;s; and fire being the principal object of their wor&s;hip on earth, they keep it continually burning in their eggaris or temples. They &s;ay, it was fir&s;t brought from heaven, together with the zundeva&s;ta or book of the law, by Zerd&ucirc;&s;t or Zert&ucirc;&s;t, the Zoroa&s;ter of the Greeks; and that it hath been pre&s;erved unex|tingui&s;hed ever &s;ince. They &s;ay, that God being of the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance as fire, they are therefore commanded to wor&s;hip it. So great is their vene|ration for that element, that if their hou&s;es were on fire, they would &s;ooner be per&s;uaded to pour oil to increa&s;e, than water to a&s;&s;uage the flame. They mu&s;t not, on any account, endeavour to quench fire, but mu&s;t leave it to go out gradually of it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory and religion of the Gaures, Guebres, or Par&s;is, be&s;ides being a very intere&s;ting &s;ubject of them&s;elves, merit the attention of the learned, by the connection the&s;e people have had with the He|brews, Greeks, and perhaps even with the Chi|ne&s;e. Great lights may be had from the works of Zoroa&s;ter by men of true genius, who are well &s;killed in the Oriental languages, by comparing them with other Oriental manu&s;cripts; and very important di&s;coveries may be made concerning the origin of mankind, and the hi&s;tory of tho&s;e ages which were near the deluge. Such of the writings of Zoroa&s;ter as &s;till remain, &s;peak of the creation of the univer&s;e, of the terre&s;trial paradi&s;e, of the di&s;per&s;ion of mankind, and the cau&s;e of the re&s;pect paid by the Par&s;is to fire, which they call Athro Eborime&s;dao, Son of God. They contain al&s;o an
<PB N="181" REF="1810">
account of the origin of evil, moral and natural; eulogiums on all the angels that were appointed to the government of the univer&s;e; many hi&s;torical facts, which are more fully related in other works, written in modern Per&s;ic. They al&s;o frequently mention the kings and heroes of the fir&s;t dyna&s;ty, and exhibit their chronology. La&s;tly, they contain predictions with re&s;pect to latter times, &s;everal par|ticulars relating to the end of the world and the re|&s;urrection, &s;ome excellent moral precepts, and a very exten&s;ive ceremonial code. God is called by Zoroa&s;ter Menio&s;&s;epene&s;te, which &s;ignifies a being ab&s;orbed in excellence. Such of the Per&s;ians and Indians who profe&s;s them&s;elves ob&s;ervers of his law and wor&s;hip, are thoroughly per&s;uaded of his divine mi&s;&s;ion; and &s;uppo&s;e, that he received the books of his law from God him&s;elf, after having pa&s;&s;ed ten years at the foot of his throne. We &s;hall give a more particular account of the religion of the Par&s;is, when we come to Per&s;ia.</P>
<P>The Par&s;is think marriage &s;o conducive to eter|nal happine&s;s, that if a rich man's &s;on or daughter happens to die before wedlock, he hires &s;ome per|&s;on to marry the decea&s;ed.</P>
<P>They have a &s;trange notion with re&s;pect to the burying of the dead; for they think the noble&s;t &s;epulchre they can be&s;tow on their decea&s;ed friends is that of expo&s;ing them to be devoured by the fowls of the air. When the corp&s;e is brought to the place where it is to be expo&s;ed, if a dog can be allured to take a cake out of the defunct's mouth, they look upon it as an infallible &s;ign of his being gone to heaven; but if the dog, not be|ing hungry, or loathing the object, refu&s;es the mor&s;el, they think their friend's &s;tate is truly mi&s;e|rable. Again, if, upon returning a day or two af|ter, they find that the vultures have fir&s;t plucked out the right eye, they take it for a certain &s;ign of
<PB N="182" REF="1820">
his felicity; but if the left, conclude that his lot is extremely wretched. Whatever is cut off their heads and beards is carefully pre&s;erved, and inter|red in their burial places, which afford the mo&s;t horrid pro&s;pect, much more &s;hocking than a field of &s;laughtered men; a number of putrid carca&s;es huddled together, variou&s;ly mangled and torn by the ravenous vultures. Nor is the &s;tench le&s;s in|tolerable than the pro&s;pect is terrible, being &s;uffi|cient to &s;trike any man dead who was to endure it but a little while.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now mention a few particulars relating to the inhabitants of Hindo&s;tan in general.</P>
<P>The chief diver&s;ions of Hindo&s;tan are hawking and hunting, in which they employ leopards as well as dogs; &s;hooting, both with the bow and gun; riding; walking in their gardens, which are ac|commodated with &s;hady walks and cooling foun|tains, and where they &s;it or &s;leep on carpets, in the garden-hou&s;es, during the heat of the day. The people here are fond of mountebanks, jugglers, and tumblers, who are very dextrous in their profe&s;&s;ions. Within doors, they pa&s;s their time often in playing cards; which differ from ours, both as to the fi|gures and greater variety of &s;uits. The people of Hindo&s;tan delight much in mu&s;ic; and have many &s;orts of in&s;truments, &s;ome few &s;trung, but mo&s;t of them blown. Their tunes are generally di&s;agreeable to the ears of Europeans.</P>
<P>The common di&s;ea&s;es found in Hindo&s;tan are fluxes, hot fevers, and calentures, which &s;eize the head and brain more than other parts. A &s;ort of putrid pe&s;tilential fever al&s;o &s;ometimes &s;weeps away thou&s;ands, when it gets into populous cities, in twenty-four hours at mo&s;t. Agues, aches of the kidneys, rheumati&s;ms, with the gout and &s;tone, are unknown here, at lea&s;t to the natives. Almo&s;t all the Engli&s;h who arrive in the Indies are &s;eized with
<PB N="183" REF="1830">
&s;ome violent di&s;ea&s;e; but if they e&s;cape, and live temperately, are very healthy afterwards. For the cure of the above-mentioned hot di&s;tempers, the natives &s;eldom u&s;e any other remedy than fa&s;ting, or a very low diet, and &s;ometimes breathing a vein. Other di&s;ea&s;es mo&s;t incident to the people of this country are the mordechin, which is a violent vo|miting and loo&s;ene&s;s, cau&s;ed mo&s;t commonly by exce&s;s in eating; the barbeers, or a deprivation of the u&s;e of their limbs, occa&s;ioned &s;ometimes by the cold vapours and mi&s;ts of the night; the &s;onipat, or lethargy; and the pilhay, or ob&s;truction of the &s;pleen. For the&s;e al&s;o, and others, they u&s;e very &s;imple remedies.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of India are generally more healthy and long lived, but, at the &s;ame time, are more feeble and languid than tho&s;e who inhabit the cold climes.</P>
<P>The Hind&ucirc;s begin their year with the fir&s;t day of March; and the Mohammedans with the tenth, dividing it into twelve months, or rather thirteen moons. The day they divide into four parts, and the night into as many, which they call pores: each pore is again &s;ubdivided into eight parts, which they name gris: the&s;e parts of time are mea&s;ured according to the antient method, by water drop|ping from one ve&s;&s;el, or clep&s;ydra, into another; and when the ve&s;&s;el is emptied, a man, who attends, fills it again, and then &s;trikes the number of the pores and gris, which have pa&s;&s;ed, with a hammer, on a concave piece of metal, hanging by the brim, on a wire. But the&s;e time mea&s;urers are not common among them, neither have they the u&s;e of clocks or &s;un-dials.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es are built low, not above two &s;tories, and many flat at top, without gla&s;s in the windows, or any &s;huttings, to keep out the air. Neither have they any chimnies in their buildings, becau&s;e
<PB N="184" REF="1840">
they never u&s;e fire but to dre&s;s their food, and that they do out of their hou&s;es, or tents, again&s;t a wall or bank of earth, to avoid the heat. The hou&s;es in the villages are generally very poor and mean. In towns, and el&s;ewhere, tall &s;preading trees are ge|nerally planted about them, to keep them cool. The great numbers of poor thatched hou&s;es in the towns make them very &s;ubject to fire. The hou&s;es of the better &s;ort, though they make no great appearance without, are generally airy, fur|ni&s;hed with courts and gardens, and the apartments neatly pla&s;tered within, and hand&s;omely furni&s;hed.</P>
<P>The manufactures of India are chiefly &s;ilks and callicoes, of which there is great variety. Of the former are velvets, &s;attins, and taffetas, both plain and &s;triped: of the latter, callicoes, white, dyed, and painted, which la&s;t are called chintz, being often very rich and beautiful. They likewi&s;e make curious &s;ilk or cotton carpets, with a &s;ilver or gold ground; cabinets, &s;tandi&s;hes, boxes, and the like, which are nicely inlaid and varni&s;hed.</P>
<P>The merchants trade to &s;everal countries: tho&s;e in the we&s;tern parts of the empire &s;end &s;hips, called junks, with pilgrims, and great quantities of goods, to Mecca, in Arabia, whither the merchants of Aby&s;&s;inia and Egypt repair to traffic. One of the&s;e junks, be&s;ides merchandize, will carry &s;eventeen hundred pa&s;&s;engers; and, at her return, her cargo may be worth two hundred thou&s;and pounds, mo&s;t of it in gold and &s;ilver. Be&s;ides the commodities before mentioned, Hindo&s;tan affords diamonds, indigo, lack, mu&s;k, and many others.</P>
<P>The money current throughout the mogul's em|pire are rupees of gold and &s;ilver; the former is equal in value to fourteen rupees of &s;ilver, each of which are worth half a crown. There are al&s;o half and quarter rupees, with three &s;mall copper coins. In the province of Guzerat &s;ome other &s;pecies are
<PB N="185" REF="1850">
current, particularly mahmudi, five of which make about a crown.</P>
<P>The roads in Hindo&s;tan are, in general, very good, but much infe&s;ted with robbers, who often attack whole caravans, which obliges the mer|chants to have &s;oldiers, and to go well armed.</P>

<HEAD>CONSTITUTION, FORCES, and REVENUE.</HEAD>
<P>The great mogul or emperor of Hindo&s;tan, who is &s;aid to derive his pedigree from Tamerlane, the great mogol Tartar, is an ab&s;olute prince, and his crown hereditary, or rather he a&s;&s;igns the greate&s;t part of his empire to his elde&s;t &s;on, and divides the re&s;idue among his younger &s;ons; but they all u&s;ually a&s;pire to their father's throne upon his death, and fight it out, till there be but one left. A prince of the royal family mu&s;t be an em|peror, or nothing; the reigning prince &s;eldom &s;uf|fers a near relation to live. In Per&s;ia, it is ob&s;erved, they only put out the eyes of all &s;uch princes as they apprehend may be their rivals. The empe|ror, on his advancement to the throne, commonly a&s;&s;umes &s;ome grand title, as The Conqueror of the World, The Ornament of the Throne, &amp;c. but he is never crowned. His &s;ons have the title of &s;ultans, and his daughters of &s;ultanas, and their vice-roys of provinces of nabobs. The next in de|gree, which may be e&s;teemed their nobility, are &s;tiled chan, khan, or caun, as it is pronounced, and are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the names they receive on their advancement, as a&s;aph chan, the rich lord; chan channa, lord of lords. To the mogul's phy|&s;ician is &s;ometimes given the title of mechrib chan, or lord of his health. The great military officers are called omrahs, and if they have been generals of armies, they are &s;tiled mirzas; the &s;ubalterns are &s;tiled man&s;ebdars. As to the pagan princes
<PB N="186" REF="1860">
tributary to the mogul, the&s;e, as we ob&s;erved al|ready, are called rajahs, being the chief of the &s;econd, or military tribe, called Rajahputes, or R&acirc;&s;putes, i. e. The children of the rajahs. The mogul &s;uffers the pagan rajahs and nobility to in|herit the honours and e&s;tates of their ance&s;tors; but there is no &s;uch things as hereditary honours or e&s;tates among the Moori&s;h or Mahommedan no|bility, and great officers: when the&s;e die, all their e&s;tates, real and per&s;onal, are &s;eized by the &s;overeign, as in Turkey, except what he is plea&s;ed to leave their families.</P>
<P>Although the forces of the great mogul are much inferior to European troops in the art of war, cou|rage, and di&s;cipline, yet they excel, in the&s;e re|&s;pects, all the nations beyond the Indus. They may be reduced to three cla&s;&s;es: the fir&s;t is the army, which the great mogul always keeps in his capital, and which mount guard every day before his palace. The &s;econd con&s;i&s;ts of the &s;oldiers, who are di&s;tributed through the &s;everal provinces of the empire. The third compri&s;es the Indian auxiliaries, which the rajahs, who are the empe|ror's va&s;&s;als, are obliged to furni&s;h. The forces of the mogul are computed to amount to three hundred thou&s;and hor&s;e of his Monguls, or white &s;ubjects, who are u&s;ually denominated Moors in India, be&s;ides the forces of the rajahs, or black princes. The army, which daily encamps at the gates of the palace, whether the court be at Dehli or Agra, amount, at lea&s;t, to fifty thou&s;and hor&s;e. The rajahs al&s;o frequently mount the mogul's guard with twenty thou&s;and men, by turns, mo&s;t of which are foot; and when the mo|gul attacks any of the un&s;ubdued rajahs in the de|files and pa&s;&s;es of the mountains, he makes u&s;e of the Rajahputes in the &s;ervice of the black princes. The mogul's camp is a great curio&s;ity, for he lives in the field during the fair &s;ea&s;on, which la&s;ts four
<PB N="187" REF="1870">
or five months; where, be&s;ides the military men, who amount to above one hundred thou&s;and, who carry their wives and families with them, he is at|tended by mo&s;t of the great men of the empire, and followed by all manner of merchants and trade&s;men from the capital cities, amounting in the whole to upwards of a million of people, and with the&s;e he makes a tour of a thou&s;and miles every year, through &s;ome parts of his dominions, and hears the complaints of the meane&s;t of his &s;ub|jects, if they happen to be oppre&s;&s;ed by his go|vernors. There is caravan of ten thou&s;and camels and oxen that con&s;tantly attend the camp, and bring up provi&s;ions from every part of the country. The commander of this caravan is &s;tiled a prince, and is ve&s;ted with great power. The camp is at lea&s;t twenty miles in circumference, and of a round form. In the middle, on an eminence, is the mogul's tent, &s;eparated from the re&s;t by a high &s;kreen, or enclo&s;ure. Beyond this are the nobility, generals, and people of di&s;tinction, in another circle; and the re&s;t &s;ucceed in circles, according their to quality: the inferior people being neare&s;t the out&s;ide of the camp.</P>
<P>Nothing appears a greater difficulty to the mili|tary men in this part of the world, than the po&s;&s;i|bility of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting &s;uch va&s;t multitudes as the A&s;ia|tic armies frequently con&s;i&s;t of, e&s;pecially &s;o large a proportion of hor&s;e; but if it be a matter of a&s;toni&s;hment that &s;uch numbers of fighting men are frequently brought into the field, how will it appear, when it is added to the account, that every hor&s;eman has two &s;ervants, one to take care of his hor&s;e, and the other to procure him forage; and that all the&s;e are accompanied by their wives and children; that there always follows the camp a moveable town of &s;hops, where every thing is to be &s;old, as in their cities, be&s;ides &s;ome hundreds of
<PB N="188" REF="1880">
elephants for &s;tate only, and a train of women, with their numberle&s;s retinue, belonging to the prince and the great officers: for whenever the &s;o|vereign moves, he is more taken up with a vain o&s;tentation of pomp and magnificence, than with the object of the war; and it is his plea&s;ure, that his &s;ubjects &s;hould abandon the capital, in order to augment his numbers. In imitation of their &s;o|vereign, and from the &s;ame motives of pride, the le&s;&s;er princes and viceroys affect the &s;ame magni|ficence in the &s;plendor of their camps, and the num|ber of their followers. To provide for all this, the whole country is put in motion, and the &s;trict|e&s;t orders are given for all provi&s;ions to be brought into the camp: by the&s;e means all the cities, far and near, are exhau&s;ted; but the camp, for the mo&s;t part, is plentifully &s;upplied. However, it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the&s;e numerous armies &s;el|dom keep the field any time, without great lo&s;s by famine; for a very con&s;iderable diminution is &s;carce felt among &s;uch numbers, and very little re|garded from any notions of humanity: a famine is, therefore, neither con&s;idered as any thing extraor|dinary, nor will the remembrance of it ever pre|vent the a&s;&s;embling of another multitude, who mu&s;t al&s;o be liable to the &s;ame chances of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting or &s;tarving, as accident &s;hall determine. In like manner, allowance mu&s;t be made for the great lo&s;s and damage they &s;u&s;tain in men, bea&s;ts, and all the implements of war, as often as they move in diffi|cult roads and defiles, and particularly in their me|thod of pa&s;&s;ing over great rivers: for their rivers, in&s;tead of being fordable in the rainy &s;ea&s;on, be|come torrents, being &s;welled to &s;uch a degree, that they are not to be pa&s;&s;ed but &s;lantwi&s;e, the landing place being frequently above a mile below the place of embarkation.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="1890">
It is owing entirely to an ignorance of the man|ners of the A&s;iatics, that many people imagine, they never can be made &s;oldiers. It may, perhaps, be &s;hewn, that they never will, whil&s;t the &s;ame wretched government and abhorrence of innova|tion &s;ub&s;i&s;ts; but tho&s;e are greatly mi&s;taken, who attribute their dread of fire-arms, and particularly of artillery, to a da&s;tardly di&s;po&s;ition, and an in|vincible timidity. The true cau&s;e lies in the inex|perience of their leading men, who never under|&s;tood the advantages of di&s;cipline, and who keep their infantry upon too low a footing. Their ca|valry, though not backward to engage with &s;abres, are extremely unwilling to bring their hor&s;es with|in the reach of great guns; &s;o that they do not de|cline an engagement &s;o much for fear of their lives, as for their fortunes, which are all laid out on the hor&s;e they ride on. Such of the natives as have been di&s;ciplined, and encouraged by Euro|peans, and formed into a regular infantry, under officers of their own, and generally known by the name of Seapoys, have familiarized them&s;elves to fire arms, and behaved well behind walls; and when we give them &s;erjeants to lead them on, they make no contemptible figure in the field. In war with A&s;iatics alone, we have a much greater ad|vantage in their being &s;o very tenacious of their old manners, than in their want of bravery. When we march round them with our light field pieces, and make it nece&s;&s;ary to move tho&s;e enormous weights, their elephants, which at be&s;t are very untractable; if a &s;hot comes among them, they are quite ungovernable, and, at the &s;ame time, &s;o ill har|ne&s;&s;ed, that it, cau&s;es no &s;mall delay to free the re&s;t from one that &s;hall happen to be unruly, or &s;lain. Be&s;ides, not only the prince him&s;elf, but every rajah, who has the command of all the forces he can bring into the field, be they more or le&s;s, al|ways
<PB N="190" REF="1900">
appears among them mounted on an elephant, and is at once the general and en&s;ign, or &s;tandard of that corps, who keep their eyes con&s;tantly on him, and if they lo&s;e &s;ight of him for a moment, conclude that all is lo&s;t: thus we find that Auren|zebe gained two battles by the treachery of tho&s;e who de&s;ired his two victorious brothers to get down from their elephants, mount their hor&s;es, and pur|&s;ue the vanqui&s;hed: their troops mi&s;&s;ing them, immediately di&s;per&s;ed. The &s;ame practice, &s;till continued, affords our Engli&s;h engineers a fair op|portunity of deciding the fate of a whole detach|ment, by one well directed di&s;charge of a &s;ix|pounder; and tho&s;e enormous bea&s;ts &s;eem now to be brought into the field for no other end but to be a mark for our artillery. It is &s;aid, they begin to &s;ee the danger of this practice: but &s;urely, that might have been found long ago; for before the u&s;e of artillery, the general, thus di&s;tingui&s;hed, was, in like manner, expo&s;ed to the arrows of a whole army, and yet we find them in the &s;ame pe|rilous &s;ituation. Porus, the Indian king, in the time of Alexander the Great, is &s;aid to have been pierced with nine arrows, and to have &s;unk from his elephant with innumerable wounds. It is pro|bable, however, that not only their regard for their antient manners, but the expediency of keep|ing their troops together by this &s;ignal, will induce them to continue the &s;ame method; the nece&s;&s;ity of which will appear from the conduct and &s;ucce&s;s of Aurenzebe, who, when he found his army giving way on every &s;ide, ordered chains to be fa&s;ten|ed about the legs of his elephants, to convince them that he would not give the example of flight; and that tho&s;e to whom his life was dear or intere&s;ting, could pre&s;erve it by no other means but firmly maintaining their ground. To &s;hew, however, that they them&s;elves are &s;en&s;ible of the danger of being
<PB N="191" REF="1910">
thus expo&s;ed, they will &s;ometimes avail them&s;elves of the only device that can afford them any &s;ecu|rity; for it has been ob&s;erved that &s;everal elephants, capari&s;oned alike, with riders in the &s;ame rich and &s;plendid habits, have appeared in different parts of the field on the &s;ame day. Another great ob&s;tacle to their &s;ucce&s;s in war is their &s;uper&s;tition, parti|cularly their &s;trict ob&s;ervance of lucky and unlucky days, which often prevents them from taking the mo&s;t obvious advantages of an enemy. Being fond of all kinds of bea&s;ts of prey, they keep a great number of them, and often vi&s;it them be|fore they give battle: if they find them heavy and dull, they think it a bad omen, and a rea&s;on &s;uffi|cient to po&s;tpone their intended de&s;ign of an ac|tion; and, on the other hand, the accidental fury of the animal is regarded as a happy omen of &s;uc|ce&s;s. They have al&s;o a cu&s;tom of matching two wild bea&s;ts, mo&s;t commonly elephants, and having given their own name to the one, and that of the enemy to the other, they bring them together to fight, in pre&s;ence of their army; but, in this cu&s;tom, they are not altogether to be blamed for &s;uper&s;titious folly, &s;ince they have the policy to make it a very unequal match, and to give their own name to the &s;tronger. We &s;hall add to the&s;e ob&s;ervations, that notwith&s;tanding they have &s;o &s;everely &s;uffered by being &s;urprized in the night by the Europeans, they can never be brought to e&s;tabli&s;h either order or vigilance in their camp. At the clo&s;e of the even|ing, every man eats an inconceivable quantity of rice, and many take after it &s;ome kind of &s;oporific drugs, &s;o that about midnight the whole army is in a dead &s;leep. The con&s;equence of the&s;e habits is obvious; and yet it would appear a &s;trange propo&s;ition to an ea&s;tern monarch, to endeavour to per&s;uade him, that the &s;ecurity of his throne depended upon the
<PB N="192" REF="1920">
regulation of the meals of a common &s;oldier; much le&s;s would he be per&s;uaded to re&s;train him in the u&s;e of that opium which is to warm his blood for action, and animate his &s;oul with heroi&s;m. It fills the mind of an European &s;oldier at once with compa&s;&s;ion and contempt, to &s;ee a heap of the&s;e poor creatures, &s;olely animated by a momentary intoxication, crowded into a breach, and, both in their garb and impotent fury, re&s;embling a mob of frantic women.</P>
<P>There is certainly an appearance of effeminacy in the ea&s;tern dre&s;s, which has, at all times, greatly con|tributed to le&s;&s;en their military character with the European nations, who, from their own habits and prejudices, will naturally receive a &s;trange impre&s;|&s;ion, upon &s;eeing a body of hor&s;e in &s;ilk and cot|ton; and yet there is no character they are &s;o fond of as that of a warrior; and, as they have no other notion of government, they have been, from time immemorial, continually at war with one another.</P>
<P>The revenues of the mogul are computed at forty millions &s;terling, ari&s;ing from the duties on merchandize, trade, and the labour of the people; but chiefly from the pre&s;ents of the great men, and the revenues of the numerous provinces, every viceroy, or nabob and governor, being obliged to tran&s;mit to court a kind of tribute, annually, from every province. The rajahs, or black princes, un|der the dominion of the mogul, pay him an annual tribute al&s;o. By a treaty lately concluded with the mogul, the revenues, or douann&eacute; of the pro|vince of Bengal, were ceded to the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-India company, excepting a certain proportion to be allowed out of them to the mogul and nabob. The&s;e territorial revenues, it is &s;aid, will produce to the company upwards of a million annually, out of which they have agreed to pay

<HEAD>REVOLUTIONS and MEMORABLE EVENTS.</HEAD>
<P>India has been inhabited, from the earlie&s;t anti|quity, by a people who have now little or no re|&s;emblance, either in their features or manners, with any of the nations contiguous to them. Its fir&s;t inhabitants were probably from Per&s;ia, that kingdom lying betwixt it and Me&s;opotamia, where, it &s;eems to be agreed, the de&s;cendants of Noah fir&s;t &s;ettled after the flood: but whoever were the fir&s;t inhabitants, the Ethiopians &s;eem to have made &s;et|tlements very early in the &s;outhern divi&s;ion of the penin&s;ula; the inhabitants, as we ob&s;erved already of tho&s;e parts, having &s;till the &s;ame features and complexion as tho&s;e of Ethiopia. Be&s;ides, we are told, that the queen of Sheba, or Ethiopia, made pre&s;ents of the fine&s;t &s;picies, which only grow in India, and mu&s;t have been brought from the colo|nies of the Ethiopians &s;ettled there. The Arabs next po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of many of the maritime parts of the country; for a great part of the coa&s;t was &s;ubject to Arabian, or Mohammedan princes, when the Portugue&s;e arrived here, in 1500, and the&s;e had di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Ethiopians, and driven them up into the midland country, where they &s;till re|main. India was afterwards, about the year 1400, invaded by the Mongul Tartars under Tamerlane, who had fixed his third &s;on, Miracha, in the north of India and Per&s;ia; but the &s;outhern penin&s;ula of India was not reduced under the obedience of the mogul princes, until the reign of Aurenzebe. This prince depo&s;ed and confined his father Shah Gehan, who died in 1666; and having murdered his three brothers, and &s;ome of their children, to acquire the throne, he maintained him&s;elf in it
<PB N="194" REF="1940">
near fifty years; but with &s;o &s;trict an attention to the government of his empire, and &s;o laudable an admini&s;tration, that the crimes he was guilty of to pave the way to his acce&s;&s;ion, if they appeared &s;uch in the eyes of his countrymen, were quite obliterated, and he &s;eemed intitled to be ranked among the able&s;t princes, who had reigned in any age or country. He conquered more than half the provinces of Hindo&s;tan in per&s;on, and his vice|roys conquered or &s;ubjected all the re&s;t, the &s;ea-coa&s;ts of Malabar excepted; but mo&s;t of the&s;e conque&s;ts have been &s;ince lo&s;t. The revenues of the empire in his time amounted to thirty-eight millions of pounds &s;terling. He was near an hundred when he died, in 1707. He never eat any fle&s;h meat, nor ta&s;ted &s;trong drink. But all his abilities did not give him the power of &s;ecuring his crown to one of his &s;ons, in peference to the re&s;t; and it appears by his will, that he fore&s;aw the conte&s;ts which en&s;ued among them after his death. His &s;ons, Azem &s;hah and Mahomed Mauzm, fought at the head of armies not equalled &s;ince the time of Tamerlane: that of Mahomed Mauzm con|&s;i&s;ting of three hundred thou&s;and fighting men, of which one hundred and fifty thou&s;and were cavalry. Azem, who &s;eems by his father's will to have been the favourite, was defeated and killed, and Mauzm was proclaimed emperor, under the title of Ba|dahr Shah; after which he attacked his brother Kaunbuk&s;h, who was taken pri&s;oner, and died of his wounds. Badahr &s;hah died after reigning about &s;ix years, and his four &s;ons di&s;puted, in like manner, the throne. By that dependence on the great men of the kingdom, to which their conte&s;ts for the crown had reduced the de&s;cendants of Aurenzebe, the emperors elected, though de|&s;potic with the multitude, a&s;cended the throne in bonds, and were in reality nothing more than the
<PB N="195" REF="1950">
&s;laves of their mini&s;ters. Abdallah khan, and Ho&s;&s;am-Aly khan, two brothers, were powerful enough to make four, and depo&s;e five emperors: but &s;till the blood of Tamerlane continued to be held in too great veneration throughout the em|pire, to permit any others but his de&s;cendants to entertain the thoughts of a&s;cending the throne with impunity. The two brothers, and tho&s;e that &s;tood neare&s;t the throne, in virtue of their offices and power, were therefore contented to rule the em|pire, as they plea&s;ed, by &s;hewing to the people a pompous &s;overeign, who, in reality, was to com|mand nothing but the women in his &s;eraglio. With this view they fixed their choice upon Mohamed &s;hah, &s;on of one of the princes who peri&s;hed in di&s;|puting the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of their father, Behadr &s;hah. The beginning of his reign was not without a &s;troke of authority in the mode of ea&s;tern politics. The courtiers, to plea&s;e him, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated Ho&s;&s;am-Aly khan, one of the two brothers, who&s;e hands had been imbrued in &s;o much of the blood of his family. The other brother immediately appeared in arms, but was &s;oon made pri&s;oner, and died of the wounds he had received in a battle, which he fought for another emperor of his own nomina|tion. The removal of two &s;uch dangerous ene|mies to the throne, placed Mohamed &s;hah in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, with a &s;ecurity unknown to his prede|ce&s;&s;ors, &s;ince the reign of Aurenzebe; but this &s;e|curity &s;erved only to render him unworthy of it. Indolent, &s;en&s;ual, and irre&s;olute, he voluntarily gave to favourites as great a degree of power as that which the mini&s;ters of the throne had lately u&s;urped, in defiance of the will of the &s;overeign. The fa|vourites quarrelled with Nizam-al-Muluk, the viceroy of the &s;outhern provinces, who had under his uri&s;diction very near a fourth part of the empire; and who, without rebellion, had rendered him|&s;elf
<PB N="196" REF="1960">
almo&s;t independent of the emperor. He cen|&s;ured openly the pu&s;illanimous admini&s;tration, and di&s;&s;olute manners of the court, &s;o degenerate from that of Aurenzebe, under who&s;e eye he had been bred. At la&s;t pretending there could be no reme|dy to &s;uch de&s;perate evils, but a total revolution of the empire, he advi&s;ed Thamas Kouli Khan, who had u&s;urped the throne of Per&s;ia, to come and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that of Hindo&s;tan; and Thamas Kouli Khan followed his advice. An army fami&s;h|ed by its own numbers, commanded by chiefs una|nimous in nothing but their unwillingne&s;s not to fight, and the&s;e by an emperor, who could not command his fears, &s;ubmitted to enemies, whom they out numbered five to one; but the&s;e enemies had been inured to conflicts under the mo&s;t de&s;pe|rate &s;oldier of the age and were rendered invin|cible, by the expectation of plundering the capital of the riche&s;t empire in the world. A &s;kirmi&s;h de|cided the fate of the empire; Mohamed &s;hah laid his regalia at the feet of Thamas Kouli Khan, who took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Dehli, plundered it, and ma&s;&s;a|cred one hundred thou&s;and of its inhabitants. The conqueror, re&s;erving to him&s;elf all the countries lying to the we&s;tward of the rivers Indus and Attoc, re&s;tored all the re&s;t to Mohamed &s;hah, and rein|&s;tated him in the throne with formalities; after which he returned to Per&s;ia, carrying with him out of Hindo&s;tan a trea&s;ure, which, in effects, &s;il|ver, gold, and jewels, was valued at upwards of &s;eventy millions of pounds &s;terling. He entered India from Candahar, in the beginning of the year 1738, and returned to Candahar at the end of the year 1739. This dreadful incur&s;ion is reckoned to have co&s;t Hindo&s;tan, be&s;ides its trea&s;ures, the lo&s;s of two hundred thou&s;and lives. The cruelties ex|erci&s;ed in India by Thamas Kouli Khan were &s;uch, that a dervi&s;e had the courage to pre&s;ent a writing
<PB N="197" REF="1970">
to him, conceived in the&s;e terms: <Q>&startq;If thou art a god, act as a god; if thou art a prophet, conduct us in the way to &s;alvation; if thou art a king, ren|der the people happy, and do not de&s;troy them.&endq;</Q> To which he replied, "I am no god, to act as a god; nor a prophet, to &s;hew you the way of &s;al|vation; nor a king, to render the people happy; but I am he whom God &s;ends to the nations which he is determined to vi&s;it with his wrath."</P>
<P>The prince whom Kouli Khan had rein&s;tated, is &s;aid to have been murdered by the vizier Gauze Odin khan, who thereupon exalted Allum Geer to the throne of Hindo&s;tan; but, &s;ome time after, being di&s;&s;atisfied with his own election in the per|&s;on of this prince, he impri&s;oned him, kept him in clo&s;e confinement for &s;everal years, drove his children from Dehli, and, at length, to compleat the &s;y&s;tem, murdered him al&s;o, and proclaimed another prince at that capital. Allum Geer's &s;on, when he heard of his father's a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, did not long delay to a&s;&s;ert his title to the throne of his an|ce&s;tors: he cau&s;ed him&s;elf immediately to be ac|knowledged king by his dependents, by the title of &s;hah Zadah, and was recognized as &s;uch by his followers; and it was probably this prince, who had taken refuge with Sujah Doula, and was &s;olli|citing his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, when lord Clive concluded his treaty with that chief.</P>
<P>We now proceed to a brief de&s;cription of the &s;e|veral provinces of Hindo&s;tan, properly &s;o called.</P>
<P>Guzerat, formerly a kingdom, is a maritime province, on the Gulph of Cambaya, and the mo&s;t plea&s;ant in all Hindo&s;tan, though none of the large&s;t. It is watered by the Nardaba, Tapti, and other rivers. The fields look green all the year round, on account of the corn and rice which co|ver them, as well as the various kinds of trees which continually bear fruit. The inhabitants of this
<PB N="198" REF="1980">
province live mo&s;tly by robbery and piracy, plun|dering all whom they can overcome, both by &s;ea and land; nor can the great mogul re&s;train them, for their country is &s;ecure from the marches of armies into it, many parts of it being inacce&s;&s;ible, otherwi&s;e than by little boats, by rea&s;on of the many inlets of the &s;ea, which overflows the low grounds. Thevenot ob&s;erves of &s;ome of the&s;e pirates, whom he calls Zinganes, but others Sanganians, that they keep their barks on the bar of Sindi, and when they &s;ee a merchant ve&s;&s;el, get to windward of her; then drawing pretty near, before they lay her on board, throw in a great many pots full of lime, reduced to a very fine powder, and, while the crew are blinded with the du&s;t, leap into the bark, putting all to the &s;word: for they give no quarter till they are ma&s;ters of the ve&s;&s;el; and then, to prevent their pri&s;oners from e&s;caping, they cut the great tendon of their legs a little above the heel. There are other pirates on the coa&s;t, between Diu and Dand-point, called Warrels, who often a&s;&s;ociate with the Sanganians in their piracies and depreda|tions. The&s;e, as &s;oon as they get along-&s;ide a ve&s;&s;el, throw in &s;howers of &s;tones on the decks, in order to &s;ink the crew, if they do not yield. They al&s;o ca&s;t in pots full of unquenched lime, well &s;ifted; which breaking, there ari&s;es &s;uch a du&s;t, that the defendants can &s;carce either breathe or &s;ee: at the &s;ame time they fling into the &s;hip lighted wicks of cotton, dipped in a certain oil, which burns fiercely, and &s;ets fire to the parts which it lights upon. In 1716, the Engli&s;h went to burn their principal village, called Chance, &s;ixty miles to the ea&s;t of Diu, and pirating ve&s;&s;els, but were un&s;ucce&s;sful in the attempt.</P>
<P>There are in Guzerat about thirty-five cities or con&s;iderable towns, all of which are &s;ituated on, or near the &s;ea. The principal of the&s;e are Ahme|dabad,

<PB N="199" REF="2000">
which is the capital, Surat, Goga, Kam|baya, Baroch, and Bradra. On this coa&s;t lies al&s;o the i&s;le and town of Diu, belonging to the Portu|gue&s;e. Amed-abad, or Amed's city, &s;o called from a king of that name, was before denominated Gu|zerat, and gave name to the province. It is now the &s;eat of the mogul's governor, as it was formerly of the Guzerat kings, and &s;tands in a lovely plain, on the little river Sabremeti, about forty-three French leagues from Surat, being about four miles and a half in length, including the &s;uburbs, and containing a ca&s;tle, as large as a little city, a &s;tately caravan&s;erai, a palace, and a &s;pacious meydan or &s;quare. The place from an eminence appears like a wood, it is &s;o full of gardens, &s;tored with trees. In the mid&s;t of it is the Engli&s;h factory. The Hind&ucirc;s have here an ho&s;pital for &s;ick birds, and another for &s;ick bea&s;ts. Captain Hamilton &s;ays, this city is little inferior in magnitude and wealth to the be&s;t in Europe, and that the revenue it yields is generally reckoned to be ten times as much as that of Surat. That city &s;tands on the banks of the river T&acirc;pti, or T&acirc;pta, not far from its mouth. The inhabitants con&s;i&s;ting of Mohammedans, Hin|d&ucirc;s, and Par&s;is, are computed to be about two hundred thou&s;and, and among them are many very rich. Surat is very populous at all times; but, from December to April, &s;o full of people, both in the city and &s;uburbs, that lodging can &s;carcely be had. The commerce here is very con&s;iderable; for the revenues ari&s;ing from the cu&s;toms, land|rents, and poll-money, amount, one year with ano|ther, to above an hundred and &s;ixty-two thou&s;and pounds. The Engli&s;h have &s;ettled here the greate&s;t &s;taple of their trade: the Dutch have al&s;o a fac|tory in the place. The port of Surat is &s;mall, two leagues north of the bar or entrance of the Tapti, and di&s;tant from the city four leagues and an half.
<PB N="200" REF="2010">
There is not water enough to carry ve&s;&s;els, though unloaded, over the bar, until &s;pring-tides; but &s;mall barks may get up to the city at any time. Surat was &s;eized by the Engli&s;h during the late war in the Ea&s;t-Indies, but whether it is &s;till in their po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion we cannot &s;ay. Goga is a pretty large town, has a good harbour, with &s;ome trade, and admits &s;trangers to a free commerce. The place is governed by an officer from the mogol, having about two hundred men under his command. Kambaya is a large city, at the bottom of the Gulph or Bay of Kambaya, fifteen or &s;ixteen leagues from Ahmed-Abad. The town &s;warms with monkeys, who throw at pa&s;&s;engers from the hou&s;e-tops. The tides are &s;o &s;wift in the north part of the gulph, that a hor&s;e at full &s;peed cannot keep pace with the fir&s;t waves. The product and manufactures of this part of the country are &s;carce inferior to any in the In|dies; it abounding in grain, cattle, cotton, and &s;ilk. The cornelian and agate &s;tones are found in its ri|vers, and no where el&s;e in the world. Of the fir&s;t they make rings, and &s;tones for &s;eals; and the other they cut into bowls, &s;mall cabinets, &s;poons, handles for &s;words and knives, &s;nuff boxes, buttons, and other curio&s;ities. The people of Kambaya al&s;o embroider the be&s;t of any in the Indies, and perhaps in the world; but they are much infe&s;ted by their neighbours, the Kowl&icirc;s, and others, who are as great thieves by land as the Sauganians and Warrels are by &s;ea. Baroch &s;tands on the ea&s;t &s;hore of the bay, and depends on Surat, as well as Kambaya. Here the baftas are made, which are fa|mous all over India, the cotton of this country be|ing e&s;teemed the be&s;t in the world. Diu is a &s;mall i&s;land at the extremity of Guzerat, towards the &s;outh, having a town of the &s;ame name, belonging to the Portugue&s;e, with a good harbour, and &s;trongly fortified. It was once a place of great
<PB N="201" REF="2020">
trade; but, at pre&s;ent, not above one fourth of the city is inhabited, and the number of the Portu|gue&s;e, both in the town and ca&s;tle, does not exceed two hundred. The king of Portugal receives about twelve thou&s;and pounds yearly by poll tax, and &s;ix thou&s;and by the cu&s;toms and land-tax: but was Diu in the hands of &s;ome indu&s;trious nation, it would be the be&s;t mart town on the coa&s;t of India.</P>
<P>The province of Agra is one of the large&s;t in all Hindo&s;tan, having forty cities or large towns, as it is &s;aid, and above three hundred and forty vil|lages, depending on it. It is an inland province. Of the cities the principal is Agra, which gives name to the province, and is the greate&s;t city in the whole empire. It &s;tands two hundred and ten leagues from Surat, on the river Jemna, Jemini, or Chun, as &s;ome call it, which falls into the Ganges at Halabas. The ca&s;tle is the bigge&s;t in all the Indies, containing the emperor's palace, which con&s;i&s;ts of three courts, &s;et round with porti|coes and galleries, all painted and gilt; nay, &s;ome places are plated over with gold. Under the gal|leries of the fir&s;t court are the lodgings for the im|perial guards; tho&s;e for the officers are in the &s;e|cond court; and the third court contains the &s;tate|ly apartments of the emperor and his ladies. A long line of palaces, belonging to the great lords of the court, &s;tands on the banks of the river. Be|&s;ides the palaces, there are thirteen large &s;quares, above &s;ixty &s;pacious karavan&s;erays, eight hundred public baths, with a great number of magnificent mo&s;ques, &s;epulchres, and gardens. The Dutch have a factory here; but the Engli&s;h have none. The other towns of any note are Fetip&ucirc;r, about &s;ix leagues from Agra, Bi&acirc;na, and Skanderabad, fa|mous for indigo.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="2030">
The province of Dehli lies to the north of Agra. The road betwixt the two capitals is planted with trees, with a turret at every half-league, and, at every &s;tage, a caravan&s;eray for lodging travellers; yet it is much infe&s;ted by robbers, &s;o dextrous at ca&s;ting a noo&s;e about a man's neck, that they ne|ver fail, if within reach, to &s;eize and &s;trangle him. Dehli, which gives name to the province, and is the u&s;ual re&s;idence of the great mogol, &s;tands in an open plain country, on the &s;ide of the Jemna. The circuit of the walls, without which are large &s;uburbs, may be about nine miles. The fortre&s;s, which contains the emperor's palace, with the mahl or haram, beautiful gardens, and &s;tables, &amp;c. is a mile and a half in circuit, having good walls, with round towers, and ditches full of water, faced with &s;tone. At the gate of this palace, an army of fif|ty thou&s;and hor&s;e encamps daily, whether the court be at Agra or Dehli. The hor&s;es in the emperor's &s;tables are &s;aid to amount to twelve thou&s;and, and the elephants to five hundred. Of the la&s;t, that on which the emperor rides has on its back a throne, glittering all over with gold and precious &s;tones. In the&s;e countries, where the forage is burnt up with the &s;un's heat, they feed the hor&s;es in the morning with bread, mixed up with butter and &s;ugar, and in the evening they have rice-milk, &s;ea|&s;oned with pepper and anni&s;eed. All the hor&s;es in the mogol's &s;tables, and tho&s;e of his cavalry, are brought from Arabia, Per&s;ia, the province of Balkh, Bokhara, and Kabul.</P>
<P>The province of Azmir lies &s;outh-we&s;t of Dehli, and we&s;t of Agra. It is divided into three le&s;&s;er provinces or di&s;tricts, viz. Bando, Je&s;elm&icirc;r, and Soret, Azmir, which is the capital, and gives name to the province, is pretty large, and its chief trade con|&s;i&s;ts in &s;alt-petre, great quantities of which are made in it. Here is the tomb of Khoja Mondi, a
<PB N="203" REF="2040">
Mohammedan &s;aint, to which is a great re&s;ort of pilgrims from all parts.</P>
<P>The province of Sind or Sindi, by &s;ome called Tatta, from its capital, has Azmir on the ea&s;t; Mult&acirc;n on the north; a de&s;ert, and the Indian Sea, to the &s;outh; and to the we&s;t Makr&acirc;n and Seje&s;t&acirc;n, in Per&s;ia. It takes its name of Sindi or Sind, from the Indus, called by the Orientals Sindi or Sind, on both &s;ides of which it lies, from north to &s;outh. It is al&s;o &s;ometimes called by the Orientals the kingdom of Diul, from a town of that name, on its &s;outhern confines. Tatta, the capital, is a very large and rich city, and of great traffic, the Indian merchants buying a great many curio&s;ities made by the inhabitants, who are wonderfully ingenious in all kinds of arts. The city &s;tands about two miles from the Indus, whence canals are cut to convey water to it; and forty from Larri Bander, or Bun|der. It is near three miles long, and one and an half broad. The citadel is capable of lodging fif|ty thou&s;and men and hor&s;es, with convenient &s;ta|bling, and a palace for the nabob or viceroy. In 1699, no rain having fallen for three years, a plague en&s;ued, which, in the town only, carried off above eighty thou&s;and manufacturers in &s;ilk and cotton. There are above four hundred Moham|medan colleges in this city, for the training up of their youth. They have plenty of black cattle, large and good; and hor&s;es, &s;mall, but hardy and &s;wift. They hunt with dogs, leopards, and a fierce creature called &s;h&ucirc;g&ucirc;s, as big as a fox, with ears like a hare, and the face of a cat. Being &s;hewed the game, deer or antelopes, it &s;prings upon them, and &s;cratches their eyes out. The fine&s;t palanquins in all the Indies are made at Tatta. The&s;e are a &s;ort of coaches or couches, covered with a bending canopy, and carried by four men, who will trot a|long, morning and evening, forty miles a day; ten
<PB N="204" REF="2050">
being u&s;ually hired, who carry the palanquin by turns, four at a time. They are commonly very dear; but the porters may be hired for nine or ten &s;hillings a month each, out of which they main|tain them&s;elves. The Indus at Tatta is about a mile broad, and full of little plea&s;ant i&s;lands. The &s;tream is u&s;ually about &s;ix fathoms deep, but not very rapid, its motion not exceeding two and an half miles in an hour. It produces many kinds of fi&s;h, particularly very fine carp. Towards the &s;ea it is called Divelli, or Seven Mouths, although it di&s;charges its waters by many more. In April, May, and June, the adjacent country is over|flowed by it. Ve&s;&s;els called kaftis, &s;ome of which contain twenty tons, navigate it as high as the pro|vince of Ka&s;hm&icirc;r. Larri Bander, or Bunder, &s;tands five or &s;ix miles from the &s;ea, on a branch of the Indus, capable to receive &s;hips of two hundred tons burthen. This place being, as it were, the port of Tatta, a great trade is carried on in it; but the kasfilas, which pa&s;s between it and Tatta, are often robbed, though e&s;corted by one or two hun|dred hor&s;e.</P>
<P>The province of Multan, which includes that of Bukor, has to the &s;outh Sind, to the north K&acirc;bul, with Per&s;ia to the we&s;t, and Lahur to the ea&s;t. It is watered and fertilized by many rivers. Its principal cities are Mult&acirc;n, Kozdar or Kordar, Kandavil, and Sandur; and its mo&s;t valuable com|modities cotton, &s;ugar, opium, galls, brim&s;tone, and camels. Mult&acirc;n, which gives name to the province and is its capital, though not very large, &s;tands not far from the Indus, but has not much trade. It furni&s;hes the be&s;t bows, and nimble&s;t dancers, in all Hindo&s;tan. The baniyans, and k&acirc;|tri or kutteri, have a famous pagod here, to which pilgrimages are performed. The idol wor&s;hipped here is cloathed in red leather, has a black face, and
<PB N="205" REF="2060">
two pearls in place of eyes; but the Mohammedan governor takes the offerings that are made to it.</P>
<P>The province of K&acirc;bul or Kabule&s;t&acirc;n, is &s;epa|rated, on the north, from Tartary by K&acirc;f-Daghi, a chain of mountains; Ka&s;him&icirc;r lies to the ea&s;t; Z&acirc;bule&s;tan and Kandah&acirc;r to the we&s;t; and Mul|t&acirc;n to the &s;outh. The country, though watered by two rivers, which fall into the Indus, yet, being cold and mountainous, is not very fruitful: howe|ver, it abounds in aromatic trees and drugs, which are very profitable; and yields iron, which is fit for all u&s;es. Mirabolans grow in the mountains, whence that fruit is called k&acirc;buli by the Orientals; and from hence e&s;pecially come the canes, of which they make halberts and lances. A great trade is carried on from hence with the re&s;t of India, Per|&s;ia, and U&s;beck Tartary: from the la&s;t above &s;ixty thou&s;and hor&s;es are yearly brought hither for &s;ale. This province, be&s;ides K&acirc;bul, its capital, which is very large, and has two &s;trong ca&s;tles, with a great many palaces, is full of &s;mall cities, towns, vil|lages, and pagods; mo&s;t of the inhabitants being Pagans.</P>
<P>The province of Ka&s;hm&icirc;r, or Ki&s;hm&icirc;r, is bounded on the we&s;t by K&acirc;bule&s;tan; on the ea&s;t by part of Tibet; on the &s;outh by Lahur; and on the north by Tartary. It is entirely &s;urrounded by moun|tains, excepting two or three narrow pa&s;&s;ages, but within has large fine plains. According to the common opinion, there are no fewer than an hun|dred thou&s;and villages in the plains and moun|tains. The lower mountains are &s;tored with all &s;orts of cattle and game, without any wild bea&s;ts; the higher are always covered with &s;now. Innu|merable &s;prings and rivulets i&s;&s;ue from the&s;e moun|tains, which at la&s;t form a large river, that falls in|to the Indus towards Atok. Be&s;ides tho&s;e of the country, many of the European fruit trees,
<PB N="206" REF="2070">
plants, and flowers, grow here. Ka&s;h&icirc;mir, the capital, by &s;ome called Siren&acirc;ker, is a large ci|ty, &s;tanding very plea&s;antly, near a lake, and on the above-mentioned river. Its environs are &s;o delightfully diver&s;ified with the lake, gardens, hills, and canals, that the Mogols call it the Paradi&s;e of the Indies. It was once the capital of a large kingdom. The Ka&s;himirians are as fair, e&s;pecially the women, as in any part of Eu|rope. They are &s;aid al&s;o to be very witty, dex|terous, and ingenious, making a variety of curio&s;i|ties, which they vend all over the Indies; but their mo&s;t profitable manufacture are the &s;tuffs, called &s;hales, which are made either of the wool of the country, finer than Spani&s;h, or of hair, finer than beaver, taken from the brea&s;t of a wild goat in Great Thibet, and worn by the Indians and Mogols in winter, on their heads.</P>
<P>The province of Lahur lies to the &s;outh of Ka|&s;him&icirc;r, and north of Dehli. Mult&acirc;n lies to the we&s;t, and to the ea&s;t are high mountains, inhabit|ed in many places by rajahs, part of whom are independent. It is one of the large&s;t and mo&s;t fruitful provinces of the Indies, being well-water|ed, and abounding in rice, corn, fruits, good wine, and the be&s;t &s;ugars of all Hindo&s;tan. All &s;orts of manufactures flouri&s;h in the towns. Lahur, the capital, &s;tands on the river Ravi, an hundred miles from Dehli, an hundred and fifty from Agra, and upwards of &s;ixty from Mult&acirc;n. It was once no le&s;s than three leagues in length, but is now much decayed. On the road from it to Dehli are a great many pagods, or idol-temples.</P>
<P>The province of Ayud, Audih, or Hawd, contains the mo&s;t northern countries belonging to the mogols. There are many independent rajahs in it, and two noted pagods. Notwith|&s;tanding the mountains in it, it is exceeding fer|tile,

being well watered; and the trade carried on in it is very con&s;iderable. Its capital is of the &s;ame name.</P>
<P>The province of Varad or Varal, containing the north-ea&s;tern countries of Hindo&s;tan, in re&s;pect of &s;oil, fertility, and trade, very much re&s;embles that of Ayud.</P>
<P>The province of Bekar, the mo&s;t ea&s;tern of Hin|do&s;tan, is well watered, large, and rich, containing the provinces of Dowab, Je&s;uat, and Ude&s;&s;eh, in which, be&s;ides Bak&acirc;ner, the capital, &s;ituated to the we&s;t of the Ganges, are &s;everal other con&s;iderable cities, as S&acirc;nbal, Menap&ugrave;r, Rajahp&ucirc;r, and Jeh&acirc;|nak.</P>
<P>The province of Hallab&acirc;s, formerly called Pu|rop, lies to the north of Bengal, and comprehends tho&s;e of Narvar and Mev&acirc;t. Its capital, now of the &s;ame name, but formerly called Praya or Pra|ga, &s;tands at the conflux of the Jemini, or Jemna, and the Ganges. There are many other con&s;idera|ble cities in the province, particularly tho&s;e of Nar|val and Jeh&ucirc;d.</P>
<P>The province of Oule&s;&s;er, which we call Bengal, is inhabited mo&s;tly by Hind&ucirc;s, who call it Jaganat, from the pagod of that name. This province is by &s;ome travellers e&s;teemed more fertile than Egypt, bearing rice, &s;ugar-canes, corn, &s;e&s;amum, &s;mall mulberry, and other trees, and &s;upplying many foreign countries with the&s;e, and other commodi|ties. For half a crown, one may have twenty good pullets, and ducks and gee&s;e in proportion. Kid, mutton, and pork, are in great plenty. No coun|try affords &s;uch &s;tore of callicoes, &s;ilks, &s;altpetre, lakka, opium, wax, and civet; but the air is un|whole&s;ome, e&s;pecially to &s;trangers. Bengal extends near an hundred leagues on both &s;ides the Ganges, from Rajah-M&acirc;hl to the &s;ea, and is full of cities, towns, $$$$ages, and ca&s;tles. There are many great
<PB N="208" REF="2090">
canals in it, which were formerly cut out of the Ganges, for the conveniency of tran&s;porting mer|chandize, and reaching far into the country. Here idolatry reigns triumphant; the chief pagods of the Indians being built upon the Ganges, as by them e&s;teemed &s;acred. The Hind&ucirc;s here, in general, are &s;aid to be extremely voluptuous, to have a piercing wit, and to be much given to &s;tealing. The women are repre&s;ented as very bold and la&s;ci|vious, u&s;ing all &s;orts of arts to debauch young men, e&s;pecially &s;trangers, whom they ea&s;ily trepan, becau&s;e they are hand&s;ome, and go well dre&s;&s;ed. Dakka, the large&s;t city in the province, &s;tands on the mo&s;t ea&s;tern branch of the Ganges, under the tropic of Cancer, fifty leagues from Chatignan, at the mouth of the river, and an hundred from the we&s;tern mouth or branch. The tide comes up as high as Dakka, which extends four miles and an half along the river, and has an Engli&s;h and Dutch factory in it. Among the other towns, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable are, Ka&s;&s;em-Bazar, Ka&s;an-Bazar or Ca&s;&s;umbazar, Hughli or Og&ucirc;li, Chinchura, Barna|gur, Calcutta, Charnagur or Chandernagor, M&acirc;k|&s;&ucirc;dab&acirc;d or Rajah-M&acirc;hl, Maldo, Patna or Patana, and Ban&acirc;res or Banarus, called al&s;o Warana&s;i and V&acirc;na-Rajah, and by the Hind&ucirc;s in the penin&s;ula on this &s;ide the Ganges, K&acirc;&s;i or K&acirc;&s;hi. Mo&s;t of the&s;e towns &s;tand on the we&s;t branch of the Ganges, and have Engli&s;h and Dutch factories in them: at Calcutta, in particular, is the Engli&s;h factory, call|ed Fort-William, to which all the re&s;t in Bengal are &s;ubordinate. At Patna, or M&acirc;k&s;&ucirc;d&acirc;bad, the &s;ubah or nabob of Bengal keeps his court. Ban|nares is celebrated for its &s;anctity, and being the univer&s;ity of the Indies.</P>
<P>The province of M&acirc;lva lies to the we&s;t of Ben|gal and Hallab&acirc;s, and includes the countries of R&acirc;|jah-R&acirc;nas,
<PB N="209" REF="2100">
Gwaliar, and Chit&ocirc;r. It is very fertile, producing whatever is found in the re&s;t. The chief cities are Rati&s;por, the capital, and a place of great traffic, Ujen or Eujin, M&acirc;ndo, Nar, Seringe, and Chit&ocirc;r.</P>
<P>The province of Kandi&s;h or Khandey&s;h, including that of Berar, and what the great mogol po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, or formerly, at lea&s;t, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Orixa, is of va&s;t extent, full of populous towns and villages, and abounds with cotton, and manufactures of that produce. The capital of the province is Br&acirc;mpur, &s;ituated on the T&acirc;pti, about eighty leagues from Surat. The trade here is equal to that of any other city. Be&s;ides chintz, there are white calli|coes, mixed with gold and &s;ilver, whereof the rich make veils, &s;carfs, handkerchiefs, and cover|ings. The &s;ame trade is driven at Orixa or Ori&s;ha, Berar, Sh&acirc;kpur, and other towns of this province. In the territory of Berar is a ca&s;tle, called Rota or Roughtaz, &s;trongly fortified, and &s;eated on a hill, the &s;ides of which are perpendicular, except where a narrow path leads up to it.</P>
<P>The other five provinces of Ballag&acirc;t Proper, Bagl&acirc;na, Telenga, Viziapur, and Golconda, belong|ing to the empire of the mogul, &s;hall be de&s;cribed under the Hither Penin&s;ula of the Indies, in which they are &s;ituated, and to which we now proceed.</P>

<HEAD>The HITHER PENINSULA of INDIA, or that within or on this Side of the GANGES.</HEAD>
<P>THIS great penin&s;ula, in its large&s;t extent, is bounded on the north by an ea&s;t and we&s;t line, drawn from the Gulph of Kambaya to the mouth of the river Ganges, or, if you will, with the twenty &s;econd parallel of latitude; and, on the other three &s;ides, by the ocean: but, in a le&s;s extended &s;en&s;e, its northern boundary will be a line drawn from the city of Kambaya, at the head of the gulph of that name, &s;outh-ea&s;t, to the coa&s;t of Ma&s;ulipatan, on the bay of Bengal. Within the former limits are contained &s;everal &s;pacious countries; namely, the provinces of Bagl&aacute;na, Ballag&acirc;te, and Tellin|g&aacute;na or Telenga, all comprehended under the ge|neral name of Balagate; the kingdom of Vi&s;iap&ucirc;r, which, with the other three provinces, are com|prized under the name of Dekkan or Dekan; the kingdoms of Golconda and Or&icirc;&s;ha, or Orixa; the kingdom of Karnata, or the Karnatic, a part of which was formerly called Bi&s;nagar and Nar&s;inga; the kingdoms of Me&s;&s;ur, Madura, Marava, and Tanjaor; la&s;tly, the kingdoms of Kanara and Ma|lab&aacute;r. For many ages, the&s;e countries were go|verned by their own rajahs, or kings; but, &s;ince the Mohammedans have got footing in Hindo&s;tan, they have undergone various revolutions, and &s;eve|ral of them are, or were at lea&s;t before Kouli Khan's inva&s;ion, tributary or &s;ubject to the great mogul. It is indeed generally &s;uppo&s;ed, that the whole pe|nin&s;ula within the Ganges is under the immediate government of the mogul him&s;elf, and that the royal mandates from Delhi are, according to the received notion of &s;o arbitrary a dominion, impli|citly obeyed in the mo&s;t remote parts of the penin|&s;ula;
<PB N="211" REF="2120">
but this is &s;o far from being true, that a great part of that va&s;t penin&s;ula never acknow|ledged any &s;ubjection to the throne of Dehli till the reign of Aurengzebe, about the middle of the la&s;t century; and the revenues from tho&s;e Indian kings and Moori&s;h governors, who were conquered or employed by him, have &s;ince his death, but e&s;pe|cially &s;ince the above-mentioned inva&s;ion, been in|tercepted by the viceroys, whom his weaker &s;ucce&s;|&s;ors have appointed for the government of the pe|nin&s;ula; &s;o that, at this time, neither can the tri|bute from the &s;everal potentates reach the court of Dehli, nor the vigour of the government extend from the capital to tho&s;e remote countries. In fine, ever &s;ince the irrecoverable &s;troke which the mogul family received by the inva&s;ion of Thamas Kouli Khan, mo&s;t of the di&s;tant and powerful na|bobs have thrown off all &s;ubjection to them, and &s;eized the revenues of their re&s;pective provinces. When lord Clive went over la&s;t to Bengal, to &s;ettle the affairs of that country, the pre&s;ent mogul was with Sujah Dowla, whom he had con&s;tituted his vizier, and to whom he applied, after the mur|der of his father at Dehli, for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in recovering the throne of his ance&s;tors. By the treaty which lord Clive concluded with the&s;e princes, the Ea&s;t India company guarantied the dominions they were then re&s;pectively in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of. What turn the affairs of the mogol have &s;ince taken, we cannot pretend to give our readers any certain information, nor is it of any great im|portance. That divi&s;ion of the penin&s;ula called Decan, extending from Bala&s;ore-Jagonaut, or there|abouts, to Cape Comorin, is under a viceroy or ni|zam, (who u&s;ed to be appointed by the mogul) of exceeding great power, having within his juri&s;dic|tion &s;even large territories or provinces, to which he had the undi&s;puted right of nominating nabobs
<PB N="212" REF="2130">
or governors. In all parts of India, as we ob&s;erved before, there are &s;till large di&s;tricts, under Indian kings, called rajahs; &s;uch as Me&s;&s;&ucirc;r, or Mai&s;&s;ore, who&s;e capital is Seringapatam, and Tanjore or Tan|jaor, who&s;e capital is of the &s;ame name. There are al&s;o among the woods and mountainous parts of the country, &s;everal petty princes, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of polygars, who are all tributary to the na|bobs, as the&s;e are to the viceroy, who&s;e re&s;idence is at Aurengabad. The Carnatic is that part of the penin&s;ula which comprehends the principal &s;ettle|ments of the Europeans; namely, Madra&s;s, Pon|dicherry, and Arcot.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the climate and &s;ea&s;ons of this penin&s;ula, that chain of mountains which runs thro' it, from north to &s;outh, are the cau&s;e of an extra|ordinary phaenomenon; for while it is winter on one &s;ide of the&s;e, it is &s;ummer on the other. On the coa&s;t of Malabar, a &s;outh-we&s;t wind begins to blow from the &s;ea, about the end of June, with continued rain, and la&s;ts near four months, during which time the weather is calm and &s;erene on the coa&s;t of Coromandel; and, towards the end of Oc|tober, the rainy &s;ea&s;on, or change of the mon&s;oon, begins on the Coromandel coa&s;t, which having no good ports, and the tempe&s;tuous waves beat|ing continually again&s;t it, is &s;o dangerous for the &s;hipping to remain there, during the three en|&s;uing months, that it is &s;carce ever attempted This is the cau&s;e of the periodical return of ou$ &s;hips to Bombay, where there is a &s;ecure harbour and convenient docks. This penin&s;ula lying al+mo&s;t entirely within the torrid zone, the air is hot particularly in April and May, when the hot wind blow, for two or three hours, in the morning, wit a &s;corching heat, coming over a long tract of burr+ing &s;ands, for &s;everal hundred miles: but then, a+bout noon, the wind blows from the &s;ea in the op
<PB N="213" REF="2140">
po&s;ite direction, and refre&s;hes the country with cool|ing breezes; for the wind alters every twelve hours here, and blows off the land from midnight till almo&s;t noon, and from the &s;ea the other twelve hours: but this mu&s;t be under&s;tood to be on or near the &s;hore.</P>
<P>The &s;oil, being refre&s;hed and fertilized by the periodical rains, yields in abundance palms, cocao|nuts, tamarinds, guavos, mangos, plantains, pine|apples, oranges, lemons, pomegranates, and me|lons, together with rice, wheat, pepper, and a va|riety of garden &s;tuff. The animals are elephants, camels, hor&s;es, oxen, buffaloes, &s;heep, deer, lions, tigers, and many other wild bea&s;ts, and game; and there is plenty of fi&s;h and fowl. There are al&s;o &s;erpents, &s;corpions, mu&s;ketos, locu&s;ts, monkeys, and &s;hining-flies, which appear like &s;tars upon the trees in the night.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this penin&s;ula con&s;i&s;t chiefly of Mogols and Hind&ucirc;s, who are the original na|tives, (by us called Indians) Par&s;is, Moors, and Europeans, of &s;everal nations. It &s;eems probable, as we ob&s;erved under Hindo&s;tan, that a colony from Ethiopia antiently &s;ettled in the &s;outhern di|vi&s;ion of the penin&s;ula, where their po&s;terity, now called Moors, &s;till remain, none but blacks po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ing any part of that country; and, that they came from Ethiopia, appears not only from their com|plexion, but from their long hair and regular fea|tures, very different from tho&s;e of the other African blacks. It may be &s;aid, perhaps, that the people of this country were originally black; but this is far from being probable, becau&s;e none of the na|tives of the other parts of India are black, though they lie much nearer the equator.</P>
<P>As to religion, the inhabitants are either Eu|ropean Chri&s;tians, or tho&s;e of St. Thomas, Mo|hammedans of the &s;ect of Omar, or pagans and idolaters. Of the religion of the pagan Par&s;is, called
<PB N="214" REF="2150">
al&s;o Guebres, Gaures, Magians, or fire-wor&s;hip|pers, we have already given &s;ome account under Hindo&s;tan, and &s;hall &s;ay &s;omething farther under Per&s;ia. As to that of the Hind&ucirc;s or Indians, they &s;eem to have lo&s;t all memory of the ages when they fir&s;t began to believe in Vi&s;tnou, E&s;wara, Brama, and a thou&s;and divinities &s;ubordinate to the&s;e, who are wor&s;hipped in temples, called pagodas, all over the Penin&s;ula, and Hindo&s;tan, the whole extent of which is holy to its inhabitants; that is, there is no part in which &s;ome divinity has not appeared, and done &s;omething to merit a temple, and prie&s;ts to take care of it. Some of the&s;e temples are of immemorial antiquity, and at the &s;ame time of &s;uch &s;tupendous labour, that they are &s;uppo&s;ed to have been built by the gods to whom they are con&s;ecrated. The hi&s;tories of the&s;e gods are a heap of the greate&s;t ab&s;urdities. Here E&s;wara twi&s;ts off the neck of Brama; there, the &s;un gets his teeth knocked out, and the moon her face beaten black and blue, at a fea&s;t, at which the gods quarrel, and go to loggerheads. They &s;ay, that the &s;un and moon carry in their faces to this day the marks of this broil. Sometimes a mo|ral or metaphy&s;ical allegory, or a trace of the hi&s;to|ry of an antient legi&s;lator, is di&s;cernible in the&s;e &s;tories; but, in general, they are &s;o very extrava|gant and incoherent, that we cannot help being &s;urprized, how a people, &s;o rea&s;onable in other re|&s;pects, &s;hould have adopted &s;uch a heap of chimeras as a creed of religion, did we not find the &s;ame credulity in the hi&s;tories of nations much more enlightened.</P>
<P>The bramins, who, as we ob&s;erved already, are the tribe of the prie&s;thood, de&s;cend from the brachmans or gymno&s;ophi&s;ts, who are mention|ed with &s;o much reverence by antiquity; and though their reputation now, as philo&s;ophers or men of learning, is much inferior to that of their ance&s;tors, yet, as prie&s;ts, their religious doc|trines
<PB N="215" REF="2160">
are &s;till implicitly followed by the whole na|tion, and, as preceptors, they are the &s;ource of all the little knowledge to be found in India.</P>
<P>The bramins and baniyans &s;hed no blood, and eat no fle&s;h, holding the doctrine of tran&s;migration. The former encourage wives to burn them&s;elves with their decea&s;ed hu&s;bands; and &s;eem to make the perfection of religion to con&s;i&s;t in a punctual ob&s;ervance of numerous ceremonies performed in the wor&s;hip of their gods, and in a &s;trict attention to keep their bodies free from pollution: hence purifications and ablutions, as dictated by their &s;criptures, are &s;crupulou&s;ly ob&s;erved by them, and take up no &s;mall portion of their time. The ma|ny temporal advantages which the bramins derive from their &s;piritual authority, and the impo&s;&s;ibility of being admitted into their tribe, have, perhaps, given ri&s;e to that number of joquees and fakirs, a &s;ort of pagan fanatics, who torture them&s;elves with &s;uch various and a&s;toni&s;hing penances, only to gain the &s;ame veneration which is paid to a bramin. The tribes and ca&s;ts, into which the Indians are di|vided, are reckoned by travellers to be eighty-four: perhaps, when India is better known, they will be found to be many more. All the&s;e acknowledge the bramins for their prie&s;ts, and with them admit tran&s;migration. It is on account of this opinion, that &s;ome of them afflict them&s;elves at the death of a fly, though occa&s;ioned by their inadvertence: but the far greater number of tribes are not &s;o &s;crupu|lous, eating, though very &s;paringly, both fi&s;h and fle&s;h, except beef, the bull being one of their gods. The Moors or Mohammedans eat every thing al|mo&s;t, except &s;wine's-fle&s;h; but few, either of them or the pagans, drink any other liquor than water: &s;ome of the pagans, indeed, drink palm-wine, and toddy, which is drawn from the cocoa-nut tree.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="2170">
As to the Briti&s;h e&s;tabli&s;hments in the penin&s;ula, they are divided into two governments, independent of each other. Bombay commands the factories on the we&s;tern coa&s;t, commonly called the Malabar coa&s;t, together with tho&s;e in Per&s;ia; and the e&s;ta|bli&s;hments and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions on the ea&s;tern or Coro|mandel coa&s;t, are under the government of Ma|dra&s;s, as tho&s;e in Bengal are under that of Calcutta.</P>
<P>To this brief account of the Hither Penin&s;ula, we &s;hall add a &s;hort de&s;cription of the chief pro|vinces, towns, and European &s;ettlements, begin|ning at Cape Komorin, and proceeding along the Coromandel coa&s;t, from &s;outh to north, and then along the Malabar coa&s;t, until we return again to Cape Komorin.</P>
<P>The kingdom or province of Madura, or rather Mat&ucirc;ray, begins at Cape Komori, commonly called Komor&icirc;n. It is bounded on the ea&s;t by the domi|nions of the king of Tanjaor; on the &s;outh by the Indian Sea; on the we&s;t by the country of Mala|bar, from which it is &s;ervered by the mountains of G&acirc;tti or G&acirc;te; and on the north by the territories of May&s;&s;&ucirc;r or Me&s;&s;&ucirc;r, and tho&s;e belonging to the governor of Jinji. This kingdom is as large as Fortugal, extending about three degrees and a half from north to &s;outh, and is in breadth about eighty miles, where wide&s;t. It is reckoned to contain &s;eventy palieakarens, who are ab&s;olute lords in their re&s;pective &s;tates, but pay a tax to the king. This prince may ea&s;ily bring into the field twenty thou|&s;and foot, and five thou&s;and hor&s;e. He has be|&s;ides five hundred elephants.</P>
<P>The coa&s;t of Madura, along which there is a va|luable pearl fi&s;hery, is de&s;titute of gra&s;s, herb, or plant, excepting thi&s;tles and hou&s;e-leek; nor will cocoa trees grow there; yet it abounds with hares and partridges. Here are mice as large as cats, who dare not attack them. This country was for|merly
<PB N="217" REF="2180">
a part of the kingdom of Bi&s;n&acirc;gar, or Nar|&s;inga, and produces a great deal of cotton, but none fine. The principal places in Madura are the capital of the &s;ame name, about two degrees north of the cape, where the Romi&s;h mi&s;&s;ionaries have a church; Tri&s;hirap&acirc;lli, a large, &s;trong, po|pulous city, about one degree north of Madura, where the Romi&s;h mi&s;&s;ionaries have &s;everal churches; Manapar, lying about the middle of the coa&s;t, where the Dutch have a factory; and Tutukurin, a large &s;ea-port, which, with &s;everal other &s;maller ones, belongs to the Dutch. This colony &s;uperin|tends a great fi&s;hery, that lies a little to the north|ward, and is &s;aid to bring the Dutch company twenty thou&s;and pounds yearly tribute. Sea horns, of which they make bracelets all over the Indies, are found on this coa&s;t, and, in the &s;and &s;eed-pearl.</P>
<P>To the ea&s;t of Madura lies the kingdom or principality of Marava, or the Maravas, having to the &s;outh and to the ea&s;t, the &s;ea, and to the north Tanjaor. The prince of this country is tributary to that of Madura, and re&s;ides at Ramanadaburam, the capital of the country, &s;ix or &s;even miles from the ea&s;tern coa&s;t, and twenty from the promontory of Koyel, or Koil, which is the mo&s;t &s;outh-ea&s;t part of Marava, bounding the coa&s;t of the fi&s;hery ea&s;tward, and beginning that of Coromandel. Due ea&s;t from the promontory, about three quar|ters of a mile, is an i&s;land, named by &s;ome Ra|manankor, by others R&acirc;mana Koyel, from which runs a continued reef of rocks and &s;ands, com|monly called Adam's-bridge, as far as the i&s;land of Manaar, on the coa&s;t of Zeloan, Zeilon, or Ceilon.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Tanjaor, or Tanjour, lies to the north of Marava, and to the ea&s;t of Mad&ucirc;ra, being wa&s;hed on the ea&s;t by the &s;ea. The &s;oil of this little &s;tate is very fertile, being watered by the river Kaveri, which is a branch of the great Kolo|r&acirc;n,
<PB N="218" REF="2190">
and divides into &s;everal arms. The prince's revenues amount to &s;everal millions. The princi|pal places in this kingdom are Tanjaor, which gives name to it, and is its capital; Negapatam, which &s;tands &s;ix leagues from Cape Kalliamera, or Kallamedou, and is a Dutch colony and fortre&s;s, taken from the Portugue&s;e by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the king of Tanjaor, its chief commodities being to|bacco and long cloth; Taranganbouri, called by Europeans Tranquebar, or Trinquebar, which &s;tands at the mouth of the Kaveri, and belongs to the Danes; but the colony is &s;aid to be poor, and the trade incon&s;iderable. However, as the Dani&s;h Ea&s;t-India company is now in a more flou|ri&s;hing condition, than when our author wrote, it may be &s;uppo&s;ed that this colony is al&s;o in a better condition.</P>
<P>To the north of Tanjaor lies the kingdom of Karn&acirc;ta, Karn&acirc;tika, or Karn&acirc;tik, as the Moguls call it, which was formerly a monarchy of great extent, under the names of Bi&s;n&acirc;gar and Nar&s;inga. At pre&s;ent it is reduced to much narrower bounds, and is, or was not many years ago, a province of the great mogul's empire. It is bounded on the ea&s;t by the bay of Bengal; on the north by the river Kri&s;tna, which divides it from Golkonda; on the we&s;t by Vi&s;ap&ucirc;r, or Vi&s;iap&ucirc;r; and, on the &s;outh, by the kingdoms of Me&s;&s;&ucirc;r and Tanjaor: being in length, from &s;outh to north, about three hundred and forty-five miles, and two hundred and &s;eventy-&s;ix in breadth from ea&s;t to we&s;t. This large country is for the mo&s;t part champaign, fertile, and populous. Towards the middle are &s;ome moun|tains running northward, which &s;eem to be branches of the G&acirc;tti, or G&acirc;te. The inhabitants are called Badagas. To the ea&s;t and &s;outh of the&s;e moun|tains, the Tamul, or Damul language, the &s;ame with the Malab&acirc;ric, is &s;poken; and to the north
<PB N="219" REF="2200">
and we&s;t of them, nothing is in u&s;e but the Talank, Talenga, or Kanarin, which prevails in Vi&s;iap&ucirc;r, and from Malabar to Surat, and the pro|vinces between that city and Golkonda. The whole country of Karnate is divided into Paliagaren, or little principalities, who&s;e Naiks, or princes, are all &s;overeigns in their re&s;pective territories, but &s;ubordinate to the great mogul. The principal in|land places in this country are Arkat, the capital, on the river Pallaru, or Pallamalerow; Jinji, once the capital of a kingdom of the &s;ame name; Shet|tam-pettou, a large city, and the &s;eat of the nabob, or viceroy, of the great mogul; Arani, a large city on the river Karva, or Karvey; Velour, ano|ther large city, five miles we&s;t of Arkat, on the river Pallaru; Tiroupati, Troupadi, or Tripeti, twenty-two leagues we&s;t-north-we&s;t of Fort St. George; Kolalam, or Koralam, a great city, twenty-five leagues we&s;t-by-north of Vel&s;our; Bengoulou|row, a large city, about twelve leagues &s;outh-we&s;t of Koralam; Chinnaballabaram, another city, eleven leagues from Koralam to the north-we&s;t; Chirpi, a con&s;iderable city, the mo&s;t we&s;t ward of Carnata; Penoukonda, or Pennagonda, on the river Pen|nerow, twenty leagues north-ea&s;t of Chirpi; Gummi Paleam, twelve leagues north-ea&s;t of Chinnaballa|baram; Kadapa, a great city, twenty-two leagues from Gummi Paleam; Gandikotta, a con&s;iderable city, and famous fortre&s;s, &s;ixteen leagues north-we&s;t of Kadapa, in latitude of 15&deg;; Tadimeri, a great city, twelve leagues &s;outh-we&s;t of Gandikotta; Anatapouram, another city, eight leagues north-we&s;t by north from Gummi Paleam; Raydourgan, on a river which falls into the Kri&s;hna, the utmo&s;t bounds of Karnata northward; Ranibeddalourou, twenty-two leagues we&s;t of Raydourgan; Bi&s;na|gar, the antient capital of Carnata when in its &s;plendor. The&s;e are the principal inland cities;

<P>On the &s;ea-coa&s;t, commonly called the Coro|mandel coa&s;t, the mo&s;t remarkable places are Porto Novo, where great quantities of cotton-cloth of &s;e|veral &s;orts are made. The Portugue&s;e are numerous here, but the bulk of the inhabitants are Hind&ucirc;s. The Engli&s;h and Dutch have al&s;o &s;ome hou&s;es in this port. Fort St. David's, a colony and fortre&s;s belonging to the Engli&s;h, who bought it from a Moratta, or Maharatta prince, in 1686, for ninety thou&s;and pagodas. The fort is pretty &s;trong, and &s;tands clo&s;e to a river; and the territory, which is fertile, well watered, healthful, and plea&s;ant, ex|tends eight miles every way. About 1698, the &s;ort narrowly e&s;caped being &s;urprized by the free|booters, who inabited the neighbouring mountains, and got admitance under pretence of lodging the mogul's trea&s;ure there; but they were all killed, before the ambu&s;h without could force open the gate. This colony produces &s;tore of long cloths; and, without its a&s;&s;i&s;tance, that of Fort St. George, on which it depends, would make but a &s;mall figure in trade to what it does at pre&s;ent. The black cattle here are &s;mall, but cheap, and in great numbers; while the rivers and &s;eas abound with fi&s;h. Kud|delor, or Koudelour, by the Hind&ucirc;s called Kour|ralour, lies about a mile to the &s;outhward, on a river capable to receive &s;hips of two hundred tons. Ponticheri, or Pondi&s;herri, the chief e&s;tabli&s;hment which the French have in the Indies, lies about five leagues to the north of Fort St David's. The city was large, and the &s;treets &s;trait, the hou&s;es of the Europeans being of brick, and tho&s;e of the Indians of earth; but, during the late war, it was taken by the Engli&s;h, and, with its &s;trong regular fortifications,
<PB N="221" REF="2220">
demoli&s;hed. Sadras, Sadrats, or Saderas Patam, a &s;mall factory of the Dutch for buying up cloth, to the north of Pondicheri. St. Thomas, called al&s;o Meliapour, to the north of Sadras, where the Portu|gue&s;e have a &s;ettlement. The town takes its name from the apo&s;tle, concerning whom there are many traditions and legends in this country: they even pretend to &s;how his grave on a hill about twelve leagues from the town. Fort St. George, an Eng|li&s;h &s;ettlement, called al&s;o Madra&s;s, and Madra&s;s|patan, from the city of that name in which it is &s;ituated. The natives call it Jenna Pattenam, or, as the Engli&s;h commonly pronounce it, China|patam. The town is divided into two parts, called the White and Black Towns, the former of which is inhabited by Europeans, and the latter by Jen|toes, or Gentoos, Mohammedans, Armenians, and Portugue&s;e, who have all their re&s;pective churches, all religions being tolerated there. The White Town is walled quite round, with &s;everal ba&s;tions and bulwarks to defend it; and it has the &s;ea on one &s;ide, and a river on the other. It is about four hundred paces long, and one hundred and fifty broad, divided into pretty regular &s;treets, with Fort St. George in the centre. There are two churches in it, one for prote&s;tants, the other for Roman catholics, with a good ho&s;pital, a mint for coining rupees and pagodas, and a town-hall, underneath which is a pri&s;on for debtors. The town is a corporation, con&s;i&s;ting of a mayor and aldermen, formerly cho&s;en by the burghers, but at pre&s;ent by the governor and his council, in con|&s;equence of which, every thing is carried as the governor would have it, who can annul all deci&s;ions in ca&s;e of debt, or otherwi&s;e, made by the court, which is properly a court of con&s;cience. The Black Town is walled towards the land, the &s;ides towards the Sea and White Town being open.

The &s;ituation of Madras is far from being commo|dious. It fronts the &s;ea, which rolls there more than on any other part of the coa&s;t of Coromandel: the foundation is in &s;and, with a &s;alt-water river on its back, which hinders all fre&s;h &s;prings being brought within a mile of the town; and, in the rainy &s;ea&s;on, cau&s;es inundations on one &s;ide, while the &s;ea often threatens de&s;truction on the other. From April to September the &s;un is &s;corching hot, &s;o that, but for the &s;ea breezes, the place could not po&s;&s;ibly be inhabited. The diamond mines being no more than a week's journey from hence, the&s;e precious &s;tones are pretty plenty here; altho' few large ones are brought to market, &s;ince that which governor Pitt &s;ent to England. Any one may dig at the mines, after agreeing with the great mogul's officer for a &s;pot of ground, which is walled about, and centinels placed round it. All &s;tones, &s;ixty grains weight, belong to the empe|ror, and it is death to &s;ecrete any of them. The colony produces very little of its own growth or manufacture for foreign markets; which yet it &s;up|plies with foreign commodities, particularly China, Per&s;ia, and Mokha, or Mocha, &s;haring that commerce with Surat. The colony is well peopled, there being computed to be upwards of eighty thou&s;and inha|bitants in the towns and villages dependent upon it; among whom may be reckoned five or &s;ix hundred Europeans: but, as their provi&s;ions are brought from other parts, any enemy, who is &s;tronger at &s;ea, may ea&s;ily di&s;tre&s;s them. Pallia|katta, or Polikat, lying to the north of Madras, belongs to the Dutch, who have a fort there named Gueldria, with a few &s;oldiers in garri&s;on.</P>
<P>The country of Ikkeri, and the kingdom of May&s;&s;our, or Me&s;&s;&ucirc;r, formerly belonged to Kar|nata. Ikkeri extends in length, from &s;outh to north, about one hundred and thirty miles, and in
<PB N="223" REF="2240">
breadth fifty-eight. It is bounded on the north by the Sunda Rajahs territories; on the &s;outh by May&s;&s;our; on the ea&s;t by Karnata; and on the we&s;t by the country of Kanara, from which it is &s;eparated by the mountains of Gatti, or Gate. It takes its name from its capital, a large town, about three leagues ea&s;t of the &s;ame mountains, con&s;i&s;t|ing of hou&s;es, intermingled with lakes, groves, fields, and woods.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Me&s;&s;&ucirc;r has to the north Ikkeri, and Karnata; to the &s;outh Mad&ucirc;ra; to the we&s;t Malab&acirc;r; and to the ea&s;t Karnata. The revenue of the prince is &s;aid to amount to near fifteen mil|lions of livres, and his forces to thirty thou&s;and foot, and ten thou&s;and hor&s;e. Travellers tells us, that the people of Ma&s;&s;&ucirc;r have an in&s;trument, with which they &s;eize and cut off the no&s;es of their ene|mies in battle, which, together with tho&s;e of their pri&s;oners, they &s;alt and &s;end to court. The chief cities in the country, be&s;ides that which gives name to it, are Shiranga-patam, Darmapouri, Carriour, and Darabarou. Heyder Alley, who is become &s;o famous of late by his &s;ucce&s;&s;es again&s;t our Ea&s;t-India company, is a native, and, at pre&s;ent, prince of this country, tho' it is &s;aid, he was originally no more than a common foot &s;oldier, or &s;eapoy.</P>
<P>In the high rocky mountains of Gatti, &s;epara|ting Me&s;&s;&ucirc;r from Malab&acirc;r, are a people called the Malleams, who are &s;aid to be very hone&s;t, good|natured, charitable, and without deceit. They are entirely free, being governed by their own laws, under captains or judges. The chief &s;ettle|ment which they po&s;&s;e&s;s is called Priata. They wear jewels in their ears and no&s;es. At the foot of the mountains of Gatti live the Chri&s;tians of St. Thomas. The Marattas, a powerful people, who follow no profe&s;&s;ion but war, and enrich them|&s;elves by obliging their wealthy neighbours to pay

them an annual chout or tribute, have al&s;o their principal &s;ettlements in the&s;e mountains or plains.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Golkonda is bounded on the ea&s;t by the &s;ea of Bengal; on the we&s;t by the pro|vince of Balag&acirc;t; on the north by the mountains of Orixa, or Ori&s;ha; and, on the &s;outh, by a part of Bi&s;nagar. Winter begins here in June, with terrible claps of thunder, and continues with furious &s;torms of wind and rain, and intervals of fair wea|ther, till October, when the rains cea&s;e. The air is &s;omewhat cold in the nights and mornings; and the heat, during the day, as moderate as in France in the month of May, till about the be|ginning of February, when the great heats be|gin again. The rains render the land exceeding fertile, e&s;pecially in fruits. Of vines there is plenty; and of the grapes, which are for the mo&s;t part ripe in January, they make white wine. They have two crops of rice, and &s;everal other kinds of grain. A &s;heep may be had here for a &s;hilling, a partridge for a penny, and a fowl for le&s;s than two|pence. Provi&s;ions bear much the &s;ame price al|mo&s;t all over the coa&s;t of Coromandel, which ex|tends from Ma&s;ulipatan to the Cape of Negapatan. This country, which is &s;aid to extend two hundred and &s;ixty miles along the Bay of Bengal in form of a cre&s;cent, and two hundred in breadth from ea&s;t to we&s;t, produces al&s;o indigo, bezoar, mines of iron, &s;teel, and &s;alt, and &s;everal of diamonds, and other precious &s;tones; but is much infe&s;ted, in many places, with &s;erpents, who&s;e venom they ex|pel by the &s;tone cobra, or by holding a burning coal to the part affected. The kingdom of Gol|konda is one of the&s;e that belong to the great mogul. The diamond mines in this country are generally adjacent to the rocky hills and moun|tains, which run quite through it, and it is &s;up|po&s;ed all the&s;e mountains contain them. There
<PB N="225" REF="2260">
are as many mines worked in the kingdoms of Gol|konda and Vi&s;iapur, as may &s;upply all the world, be&s;ides many more forbid to be wrought, to prevent the diamonds being too common. In the king|dom of Golkonda alone, there are no le&s;s than twenty-three that are wrought. The governors of the mines covenant with the undertakers or adventurers, that all the &s;tones they find under fifteen carats weight &s;hall be their own, but tho&s;e above that weight the king's: in the two capital cities, however, of Golkonda and Vi&s;iapur, there is no &s;eizure of any &s;tones. The trade in diamonds is almo&s;t wholly engro&s;&s;ed by the Banians of Gu|zerat, who furni&s;h their countrymen with them not only there, but at Goa, Agra, Dehli, &amp;c. The pre&s;ent inhabitants of this kingdom are Moors, Per&s;ians, Gentoes, Armenians, Portugue&s;e, Dutch, Engli&s;h, and a few French. The king has va&s;t revenues, ari&s;ing from lands, cu&s;toms of merchan|dize, and provi&s;ions; but chiefly from the dia|mond mines and &s;alt. He wears jewels of ine&s;ti|mable value in his crown, being a row of great diamonds, three or four inches diameter, and al|mo&s;t a foot long. Though he is tributary to the mogul, he is &s;aid to keep a &s;tanding army of an hundred thou&s;and hor&s;e and foot, be&s;ides two hun|dred elephants. The capital of this kingdom, called Bagn&acirc;gar, &s;tands about fourteen or fifteen leagues from the borders of Vi&s;iapur. The hou&s;es, excepting the king's palace, and tho&s;e of the qua|lity, are very mean, but they have all fine gardens, the beauty of which con&s;i&s;ts in long walks, kept very clean, and lovely fruit-trees; but they have neither beds of flowers, nor water-works: con|tenting them&s;elves with ci&s;terns, or ba&s;ons of water. There are in Bagn&acirc;gar many rich merchants, bankers, and jewellers, be&s;ides great numbers of very &s;kilful artificers, e&s;pecially in cotton manu|factures,
<PB N="226" REF="2270">
which they make &s;o fine, and of &s;uch lively colours, that they are preferable to &s;ilk. Here are al&s;o many Franks, or Europeans, e&s;pe|cially fugitive Portugue&s;e, be&s;ides Engli&s;h and Dutch. Two leagues we&s;t of Bagn&acirc;gar is a royal ca&s;tle, as large as a city, called Golkonda, whence the kingdom takes its name. When an omrah ap|pears on hor&s;eback in the &s;treets of the city, he is preceded by mu&s;ic, with forty or fifty troopers, an elephant or two, and men carrying banners at their heads. The lord him&s;elf is attended by thirty or forty footmen; &s;ome clearing the way, others, with fine napkins, driving away the flies; one holds an umbrella over his head, another his tobacco|pipe, others carry pots with water: la&s;tly, a camel or two, with men beating of timbrels on their backs, clo&s;e the proce&s;&s;ion. When the omrah cho&s;e his palanki, he was &s;een lying in it effeminately, with flowers in his hand, &s;moaking tobacco, or chew|ing betel. On the coa&s;t of Golkonda, ea&s;t-&s;outh-ea&s;t from Bagn&acirc;gar, lies Ma&s;ulipatan, where the Engli&s;h and Dutch have factories. Some place Madras, Paliakata, and St. Thomas, or Melia|pur, mentioned above under Karnate, in the king|dom of Golkonda. The Engli&s;h have al&s;o facto|ries at Ganjam and Vizigapatan, on this coa&s;t; and the Dutch at Nar&s;ipore.</P>
<P>Orixa, Ori&s;ha, or Ori&s;tan, by the natives called Oria, is a province which is &s;eparated from Ben|gal, on the north, by the river Guenga; has the bay on the ea&s;t; the mountains of Ballagate and Berar on the we&s;t; and Golkonda on the &s;outh, of which kingdom it was formerly a part, but afterwards go|verned by a king of its own, who was &s;ubdued fir&s;t by the king of Patan, and afterwards by Eckbar the Mogul. It extends in length, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, about five hundred and fifty miles, and in breadth about two hundred and forty. The &s;oil is fruitful in rice.
<PB N="227" REF="2280">
Its other commodities are white cloth, Bengals, oil, butter, mirabolans, bees-wax, lack, ginger, pepper, ani&s;e, and cummin-&s;eeds. Here is al&s;o plenty of iron, great numbers of cattle, antelopes, and deer, which are very tame, together with bears and monkies; but fi&s;h being wor&s;hipped, are not to be purcha&s;ed, and poultry, partridges, and phea&s;ants are very dear, as they mu&s;t not be killed without leave from the prince. This prince is &s;aid to have an annual revenue of between &s;even and eight hun|dred thou&s;and pounds; out of which he pays a tribute to the mogul of twelve thou&s;and five hundred pounds a-year, and his quota to the mogul militia, according to &s;ome travellers, is rated at four thou&s;and hor&s;e and eight thou&s;and foot. Orixa, which gives name to the province, &s;tands in the middle of it, one hundred miles from the Bay of Bengal. The other places worth mentioning are, Cattack, a large city, on an i&s;land in the river of that name, twenty-five leagues from the &s;ea; Raypore, at the mouth of the Cattack; Badruck, on the &s;ide of a river, twenty miles from the &s;ea, and fifty from Cattack; Ar&s;ipore, the capital of a little province, to which it gives name; Manikapatam, on a bay of the &s;ea; Illure, about three miles ea&s;t of Ganjam; and Jagarynat, one hundred and twenty miles &s;outh-ea&s;t of Cattack, famous for an idol's temple, to which pilgrims re&s;ort from all parts of India. The figure of Jagarynat is only an irregular pyra|midal black &s;tone, of about four or five hundred weight, with two rich diamonds near the top to repre&s;ent eyes, and the no&s;e and mouth painted with vermillion. There are about five hundred prie&s;ts belonging to it, who daily boil rice and pul&s;e for the u&s;e of the god.</P>
<P>The country which bears the general name of Decan, comprehends the province of Ballagate,
<PB N="228" REF="2290">
&s;ubdivided into tho&s;e of Baglana, Balagate, pro|perly &s;o called, and Telengana, or Talenga; and the kingdom of Vi&s;iap&ucirc;r, under which we include Konkan, or Kunkam, lying between the Gate and the Indian Sea, or we&s;tern coa&s;t. Some authors under Decan, without &s;ufficient authority, include Golkonda, and even Oria, Orixa, or Ori&s;ha, with the countries as far as Bengal and the Ganges; and &s;ome al&s;o the country of Kanara. The three provinces of Baglana, Balagate and Telenga, may be comprized under the general name of Balagate, as they lie to the north of the mountain Gate; for Balagate &s;ignifies the tramontane provinces, or tho&s;e beyond the mountains. This northern part being by much the larger and more con&s;iderable of the two, its kings, &s;tiled Nizam-&s;hah, were called kings of Decan, till it was conquered by the great mogul, Shah Jeh&acirc;n; after which, that title was given to the kings of Vi&s;iap&ucirc;r, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the remaining part of Decan; while the Mogols, with more right, added the crown of Decan to their other titles, as having &s;ubdued the larger half of it.</P>
<P>The province of Balagate, properly &s;o called, is the large&s;t of the three which compo&s;ed the northern Decan. It has Khandi&s;h and Berar in the mogul's empire to the north; Telenga to the ea&s;t; Bagl&acirc;na, with part of Guzer&acirc;t to the we&s;t; and Vi&s;iap&ucirc;r to the &s;outh. Since it fell into the hands of the mo|gul, it hath taken the name of Dowlet-abad, from its former capital. It is a fruitful plea&s;ant coun|try, abounding with cotton and &s;ugar. The San|&s;ons make it extend two hundred miles from &s;outh to north, and one hundred and twenty from ea&s;t to we&s;t. The principal towns are Aureng-abad, and Dolt-abad, or Dowlet-abad. The latter is reckoned the &s;tronge&s;t place in all Hindo&s;tan. Five miles from it, towards Bombay, are the famous pagods of Elora,
<PB N="229" REF="2300">
&s;tanding in a plain about two leagues &s;quare. In this &s;pace there are a great number of tombs, chapels, and &s;pacious temples, full of pillars and pila&s;ters, with many thou&s;and figures, all extreme|ly well cut out of the natural rock, and poli&s;hed. It is a &s;tupendous work, &s;urpa&s;&s;ing, in appearance, human force, and to be admired by Europeans, although the architecture and &s;culpture be not &s;o delicate as with us.</P>
<P>Telenga, Tillinga, or Tilling&acirc;na, has on the ea&s;t Golkonda, on the we&s;t Bagl&acirc;na and Vi&s;iap&ucirc;r, on the north Balagate, and on the &s;outh Bi&s;nagar. The capital at pre&s;ent is Beder or Bedr, a great city, encompa&s;&s;ed with brick walls, and garri&s;oned with three thou&s;and hor&s;e and foot. This pro|vince has a particular language, called the Telenga, which &s;ome make the &s;ame with the Kanari.</P>
<P>Baglana has on the north Guzerat and Ballagate, on the ea&s;t this la&s;t province, and on the &s;outh and we&s;t that part of Vi&s;iap&ucirc;r called Konkan, or Concan, belonging to the Maharattas. It ends in a point at the &s;ea-coa&s;t, between Daman and Bal|&s;era. It is the lea&s;t of all the provinces of which the Mogul empire con&s;i&s;ts; and its capital is called Mouler. The Portugue&s;e territories begin in this province at the port of Daman, twenty-one leagues &s;outh of Surat, and run along the coa&s;t by Ba&s;&s;aim, Bombay (now belonging to the Engli&s;h) and Chawl, to Dabul, extending almo&s;t fifty leagues to the north of Goa. In this province, as in the re&s;t of Decan, they marry their children at four or five years of age, and &s;uffer them to bed when the boy is ten, and the girl eight; but the females, who have children &s;o young, give over conceiving at thirty, and &s;oon grow extremely wrinkled.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Vi&s;iap&ucirc;r, called by the Mo|guls Bijap&ucirc;r, is bounded on the ea&s;t by Karnate, from which it is &s;eparated by the mountains of

Gate, or a branch thereof; on the we&s;t by the &s;ea; on the north by the provinces of Baglana and Ba|lagate; and on the &s;outh by Karnata and the king|dom of Kanara. Vi&s;iap&ucirc;r had formerly an inde|pendent king of its own; but, &s;ince the year 1685, he has been a va&s;&s;al to the great mogul, with whom, and the Portugue&s;e, he is often embroiled. The country, including Koncan, is of great ex|tent, and in general champaign and fertile, except towards the &s;ea, where it is mountainous, and co|vered with woods; but the latter abound in cattle. The vallies yield plenty of rice and cocoa-nuts; and they have many rivers, both &s;alt and fre&s;h, with &s;tore of &s;altperre. The king's forces con&s;i&s;t of one hundred and fifty thou&s;and foot and hor&s;e; and his revenues, including tho&s;e of part of Kar|nate, are &s;ix millions two hundred and fifty thou|&s;and pounds. The inhabitants are of different re|ligions, and have a peculiar language, with a &s;war|thy complexion. The capital of this country is the city of Vi&s;iap&ucirc;r, from whence the kingdom takes its name. It &s;tands on the river Mendoua, fifty-&s;ix leagues, within land, north-ea&s;t from Goa, and is very large, but has little trade. Mo&s;t of the inhabitants are Moors and idolaters. Be&s;ides this capital, there are many other con&s;iderable cities and &s;ea-ports in the kingdom of Vi&s;iap&ucirc;r and province of Koncan.</P>
<P>The coa&s;t of Vi&s;iap&ucirc;r, or, if you will, of Kon|can, which makes the we&s;tern part of Vi&s;iap&ucirc;r, is in a manner divided between the Portugue&s;e and the Hind&ucirc; &s;tates, not many years &s;ince erected in tho&s;e quarters. The principal places on this coa&s;t are, Daman, Ba&s;&s;aim, Trapor, or Tarapor, Chawl, Dandi - Rajahp&ucirc;r, Dabul - Rajup&ucirc;r, Ghiria, and Vingurla. Daman, lying twenty - two leagues &s;outh of Surat, was a place of good trade, and belonged to the Portugue&s;e, till about the year
<PB N="231" REF="2320">
1740, when it fell, with the re&s;t of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions between Surat and Goa, into the hands of the Ma|harattas, or Marats, a tribe or people who live by plunder, and who&s;e prince, or rajah, keeps his court at Settara in Decan. Trapor, or Tara|por, lies eight leagues from Daman to the &s;outh. It was a &s;mall, but very rich city, when under the Portugue&s;e, and dependent on Daman. Ba&s;&s;aim lies eight leagues to the &s;outh of Trapor, and has a harbour for &s;mall &s;hips. When in the hands of the Portugue&s;e, it was one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable places they had; the governor being &s;tiled general of the north, and having under him Diu, Daman, and Chawl, with all their territories. Over again&s;t it lies the i&s;land of Sal&s;et, which is above twenty-five miles long, and, in &s;ome parts, ten broad. This i&s;land, when po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Portugue&s;e, was &s;tocked with villages and churches, but is now in a de&s;olate condition. There are &s;everal other i&s;lands on this coa&s;t, and among the re&s;t Bombay, which we &s;hall de&s;cribe after the towns. Chawl lies about &s;even leagues &s;outh - ea&s;t of Bombay, and was formerly a noted place of trade, but is &s;ince fallen to decay. Dandi-Rajahp&ucirc;r, lying &s;even leagues to the &s;outh of Chawl, is a town belong|ing to the Siddi, who generally lies there with a fleet of the great mogul's ve&s;&s;els and &s;hips of war, be&s;ides an army of thirty or forty thou&s;and men. This place has a good harbour, and the adjacent country feeds &s;tore of black cattle, from whence the Engli&s;h at Bombay are mo&s;tly &s;up|plied, while they keep on good terms with the &s;iddi, otherwi&s;e he makes them feed on fi&s;h. Da|bul lies five leagues to the &s;outhward of this la&s;t place, at the mouth of a large river, and was former|ly a town of trade, where the Engli&s;h had a factory. Rajahpur lies exactly in &s;eventeen degrees of north latitude, above four leagues up the river of the &s;ame name, and &s;even from Dabul. Here is
<PB N="232" REF="2330">
one of the be&s;t harbours in India, and there was for|merly both an Engli&s;h and French factory in the town. The chief commodities of the country hereabouts are, &s;altpetre, calicoes, betillas, mu&s;lin, but e&s;pe|cially pepper, which grows in great plenty. Ghi|ria, which was the common re&s;idence of Angria, the famous pirate, lies about two leagues to the &s;outh of Rajahp&ucirc;r, and is well fortified by a &s;trong ca&s;tle, wa&s;hed by the &s;ea. Vingurla lies &s;ixteen leagues &s;outh of Ghiria, and was formerly a place of trade, where the Dutch had a factory for cloths. Between the&s;e two places, about a mile from the main land, lies the little i&s;le of Malwan, governed by an independent rajah, who, with three or four grabs, robs all he can ma&s;ter at &s;ea.</P>
<P>The i&s;le or Bombay, belonging to the Ea&s;t-In|dia company, lies in the latitude of fourteen de|grees north, forty-five leagues &s;outh of Surat, and about forty north of Dunda Dejapore. The Portugue&s;e, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of it &s;oon after their arrival in India, gave it the name of Boonbay, from the excellency of its harbour, which, it is affirmed, will conveniently hold a thou|&s;and &s;hips at anchor. It is about &s;even miles in length, and twenty in circumference. The principal town is near a mile long, but the hou&s;es are mean, low, and paltry, a few only excepted, belonging to the Portugue&s;e. The fort &s;tands at a little di&s;tance from the town, but not in the mo&s;t advan|tageous &s;ituation. The &s;oil of the i&s;land is &s;terile, and not capable of improvement; nor has the i&s;land any good water upon it: the be&s;t is that which they pre&s;erve in ci&s;terns after rains, that which their wells furni&s;h having a bracki&s;h di&s;agreeable ta&s;te. Tho&s;e who can afford to keep &s;ervants, may be tolerably &s;upplied from a &s;pring &s;ome miles di&s;tant from the town. The principal pro|duce of the i&s;land is fine groves of cocoa-nut trees:
<PB N="233" REF="2340">
their gardens al&s;o produce mangoes, jacks, and other Indian fruits. They make &s;alt in large quan|tities, by letting the &s;ea into the pits, where the &s;un evaporates the watery parts, while the &s;aline are left behind. As to the air and climate, they are rather unhealthy, although the natives, and per&s;ons &s;ea&s;oned to the country, live commonly to a good old age. Mo&s;t per&s;ons on their arrival are &s;eized with fevers, fluxes, &s;crophulous di&s;orders, or a di&s;ea&s;e called barbiers, which wholly enervates the body, and reduces it to a total &s;tate of inacti|vity, and a deprivation of all the loco-motive powers. After rains, a multitude of venomous creatures appear, which grow to an extraordinary &s;ize. Their &s;piders are as large as a walnut, and their toads almo&s;t equal a duck in magnitude.</P>
<P>The inhabitants are a mixture of &s;everal nations, Engli&s;h, Portugue&s;e, and Indians, amounting in all to near &s;ixty thou&s;and. Formerly the pre&s;ident of Bombay appeared with the &s;tate, magnificence, and pomp of a crowned head: he was attended, when he went abroad, with troops of Moors and Bandarins, colours flying, drums beating, and mu&s;ic playing. After the pre&s;idency was removed to fort St. George, the governor's &s;plendor dimi|ni&s;hed; and, indeed, this vanity is kept up among no European nations to its former height, unle&s;s we except the Dutch government of Batavia. A|bout two leagues from the fort is a &s;mall i&s;land be|longing to the company, called Butcher's i&s;land, of no other u&s;e be&s;ides grazing a few cattle, and hauling &s;hips for careening on &s;hore. At a league's di&s;tance from hence is another large i&s;land, be|longing to the Portugue&s;e, called Elephant's-i&s;land, from the image of that animal carved out in a large black &s;tone, &s;even feet high.</P>
<P>About three degrees twenty minutes &s;outh of Bombay, and about thirty miles &s;outh of Vingurla,
<PB N="234" REF="2350">
lies the i&s;land and city of Goa, the chief &s;ettlement of the Portugue&s;e in the Ea&s;t-Indies, which was taken from the Moors, in the year 1508, by the fa|mous Alphon&s;o d'Albuquerque. This i&s;land is &s;ituated in the latitude of 15&deg; 40&prime; north, and is about twenty-&s;even miles in compa&s;s. The river Mando|va, which is almo&s;t as much re&s;pected by the Indi|ans as the Ganges, divides it from the continent, and, at the di&s;tance of about &s;ix miles, falls into the &s;ea. The adjacent i&s;lands are very fertile, and the port, which is repre&s;ented as one of the fine&s;t in the Indies, is &s;trongly fortified with ca&s;tles and towers, and furni&s;hed with abundance of very good cannon. The rainy &s;ea&s;on continues here from June till September or October, when the land-floods bring down &s;uch quantities of mud and &s;and, as &s;top up the haven, and impede the naviga|tion. During this time, the weather is very hot af|ter &s;un-ri&s;e, when the rains cea&s;e; yet before the rains begin, that is in the months of April and May, the weather is &s;till more &s;ultry; but, from October to March, it is very moderate. The chan|nel of the river on the left, which makes &s;o noble a port, being &s;ometimes one, and &s;ometimes two miles broad, runs many miles up into the country, dividing it into &s;everal fruitful i&s;lands and penin|&s;ulas, which not only furni&s;h the city with nece&s;&s;a|ries, and the mo&s;t delicious fruit, but yield a mo&s;t delightful pro&s;pect. On the points of land, and i&s;lands in the mouth of the channels, are &s;everal forts and batteries of cannon. The channel on the right, that runs between the i&s;land of Goa and the penin&s;ula of Salzete, forms the haven of Murmugon, which &s;upplies a &s;afe retreat to the &s;hips that come from Portugal and other parts, when they are &s;hut out of the port by the &s;ands, which the river Man|dova brings down, when &s;wollen by the rains. The port of Murmugon is defended by a ca&s;tle, on
<PB N="235" REF="2360">
the penin&s;ula of Salzete. There was nothing in the Indies that could be compared with Goa, in the time of its pro&s;perity; and very few cities in Eu|rope were either larger or better built. It is &s;aid, that the revenues of the Je&s;uits, who had five hou&s;es here before they were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, were e|qual to tho&s;e of the crown of Portugal. The number of the inhabitants is &s;aid to be about twenty thou&s;and: of the&s;e the native Portuge&s;e are a very &s;mall number. The re&s;t con&s;i&s;t of Me&s;tizes, of pagans of different nations, and negro &s;laves. The natives are as black as jet, having long black hair, and many of them very fine features. It is generally agreed, that the men are, for the mo&s;t part, proud, indolent, jealous, revengeful, and indigent; the women lazy, la&s;civious, and as well &s;killed in poi&s;oning as any in the world.</P>
<P>All that remains under the Portugue&s;e domini|on, from the Cape of Good Hope, in Africa, to the city of Macao, in China, is now governed by a vice-roy or captain-general, who re&s;ides at Goa. The pomp and &s;plendor of this government is &s;till kept up, tho' the extent of it is much le&s;&s;ened, and the power and credit of it in a manner quite decay|ed. There are al&s;o as many &s;ubordinate govern|ments as ever, that is, in title, for otherwi&s;e they are of no great con&s;equence; and yet tho&s;e, on whom they are be&s;towed, have the rank and title of generals. The fall of the Portugue&s;e power and greatne&s;s in the Ea&s;t-Indies, was chiefly owing to luxury, and a corruption of manners. This cor|ruption proceeded &s;o far, by degrees, that not only many of the Je&s;uits at Goa engaged in trade, con|trary to the rules of their order, and their duty as mi&s;&s;ionaries, but de&s;cended &s;o low as to di&s;gui&s;e them&s;elves in the habits of fakirs, or Mohamme|dan monks, that they might have an opportunity of vi&s;iting the diamond mines, and purcha&s;ing
<PB N="236" REF="2370">
&s;tones of an extraordinary value, in which &s;ome of them were detected, and openly puni&s;hed. Captain Hamilton &s;ays, there could not be a more perfect contra&s;t between the former &s;tate of the ca|pital and the country about it, and that of both, when he was there. He &s;tood on a little hill near the city, and from thence counted eighty convents and mona&s;teries, to which there were &s;aid to belong not fewer than thirty thou&s;and eccle&s;ia&s;tics, of dif|ferent orders, nations, and complexions, who were not a&s;hamed to live on the labour of the laity, when the&s;e were &s;carce in a condition to &s;ub&s;i&s;t them&s;elves. The territories that immediately de|pend on Goa are, fir&s;t, the i&s;land upon which the city &s;tands, and in which there are about thirty villages; the penin&s;ula of Salzete, which is about &s;ixty miles in compa&s;s, containing no le&s;s than fifty villages, and as many thou&s;and inhabitants; the penin&s;ula of Bardes, about forty-five miles round, and computed to contain twenty-eight villages; and the Anchadives, a clu&s;ter of five i&s;lands, at &s;ome di&s;tance, of no great extent, and not &s;o well peo|pled as the former. All the&s;e places are of no great con&s;equence, farther than that they &s;upply the city of Goa plentifully with provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>South of the Portugue&s;e territories, which end at Cape de Rama, or Cape Ramus, as the Engli&s;h call it, lies the country of the rajah of Sundah, who&s;e dominions extend along the coa&s;t about fif|teen leagues, from the &s;aid cape to Marzee or Mar|zeon, and &s;ixty or &s;eventy leagues within land; be|ing bounded on the &s;outh by Kanara. He is at pre&s;ent, or at lea&s;t was not many years &s;ince, tribu|tary to the great mogul; but was formerly feuda|tory to the king of Vi&s;iap&ucirc;r, of which Sundah was a part. In Fryer's time, he re&s;ided at Sundah, whence the whole country took the name, and maintained in pay twelve thou&s;and foot, and
<PB N="237" REF="2380">
three thou&s;and hor&s;e. The country is mountain|ous, and lies on both &s;ides the G&acirc;tti or G&acirc;te. It is famous for hunting. In the woods, be|&s;ides wolves, wild hogs, monkeys, deer, elks, and cattle of a prodigious &s;ize, are three &s;pecies of tigers, of which two are &s;mall, but very fierce. The large&s;t, after killing a buffalo, and &s;ucking his blood, will &s;ometimes throw him over his &s;houl|der, as a fox does a goo&s;e, and carry him to his den. The only place in it worth mentioning is Carwar or Corwar, which lies &s;even leagues &s;outh of Cape Ramus, with a good harbour, and a river capable to receive &s;hips of three hundred tons. The Engli&s;h have a factory here, fortified with two ba&s;tions, and &s;ome &s;mall cannon, for its defence. This &s;ettlement is one of the plea&s;ante&s;t and mo&s;t healthful that the company hath on the Malabar coa&s;t. The country round is fertile and beautiful: in general, indeed, it is mountainous and woody, but the vallies abound with corn; and five days journey from hence lie the pepper mountains of Sundah, producing the be&s;t pepper in the world. Be&s;ides the animals mentioned above, a great va|riety of beautiful birds, as wild peacocks, phea|&s;ants, &amp;c. are found in the woods; nor is the &s;ea le&s;s bountiful, producing all manner of fi&s;h. Mr. Hamilton &s;ays, he &s;aw a bull killed here, who&s;e four quarters weighed a ton, be&s;ides the head, hide, and garbage: that the horns mea&s;ured twen|ty-three inches about the root, and the bones were &s;o large, that he took out the marrow with a common &s;ilver &s;poon; but that the fle&s;h is not &s;o well ta&s;ted as that of &s;mall tame cattle.</P>
<P>The company has here a chief, and council to manage their trade, principally valuable on account of the fine pepper, which is the natural product of the country. The garri&s;on in the fort con&s;i&s;ts of thirty topa&s;&s;es, be&s;ides Engli&s;h. The pre&s;ident is
<PB N="238" REF="2390">
held in great e&s;teem by the natives: when he hunts, all the people of condition in the neigh|bourhood attend him. They bring their va&s;&s;als and &s;ervants with them, armed with fire-arms, lances, and other weapons, and preceded by a number of warlike in&s;truments, as drums, haut|boys, and trumpets. Some betteelas, or fine mu&s;|lins, are manufactured here.</P>
<P>Kanora, or the Kanatic country, begins at Gon|gola, a village about forty miles to the &s;outh of Goa, and extends along the coa&s;t to the dominions of the Zamerk&icirc;n or Zamorin of K&acirc;lekut; and, with|in land up to the pepper mountains of Sundah, and the di&s;trict of Serji-Khan, in the kingdom of Vi&s;iap&ucirc;r. This country has on the north the prin|cipality of Sundah; on the we&s;t the &s;ea; on the &s;outh Malab&acirc;r; and on the ea&s;t it is bounded by the mountains of G&acirc;tti or Gattam, which divide it from the principality of Ikkeri, and part of Me&s;|&s;&ucirc;r.</P>
<P>The air of Kanara is very pure, and &s;ufficiently plea&s;ant: the country al&s;o is &s;o fertile, that it &s;up|plies, in a great mea&s;ure, all Europe with rice, be|&s;ides &s;everal parts of the Indies. Be&s;ides this grain, the &s;oil produces &s;tore of betel-nuts, and wild nut|megs, u&s;ed in dying. There is likewi&s;e &s;ome pep|per, but not comparable to that of Sundah; and wild elephants are found in the fore&s;ts.</P>
<P>The Kanarins are of a tawny complexion, and middle-&s;ized, wear their hair, dre&s;s not unlike the Hind&ucirc;s of Surat, and are generally good &s;oldiers, and mo&s;t expert in mining. They are al&s;o much addicted to commerce, which carries them to all parts of the Indies. The prime nobility have the title of naiks or naigs, as tho&s;e of Malabar are call|ed nairos. The language is peculiar, and called K&acirc;nareyn, being &s;poken with &s;ome variation of di|alect, from the borders of Malabar as far as Surat.
<PB N="239" REF="2400">
It was in this country, it is &s;aid, that the practice of widows burning them&s;elves with the corp&s;es of their decea&s;ed hu&s;bands, had its beginning. Be|fore this law was invented by the bramins, the wo|men were &s;o ready at poi&s;oning that the lea&s;t quar|rel co&s;t the hu&s;band his life. Great iron hooks are fa&s;tened to the wheels of the waggons on which their images are carried in proce&s;&s;ion on fe&s;tival days: on the&s;e &s;ome of their &s;uper&s;titious zealots are wont to throw them&s;elves; &s;o that, being turn|ed round with the wheels, they are cut to pieces: others lie &s;prawling on the ground, for the wheels to pa&s;s over them, and cru&s;h them to death.</P>
<P>No man is permitted in Kanara to ride on hor&s;es, mules, or elephants, but officers of &s;tate or troop|ers, oxen or buffaloes being the common voiture: nor are any &s;uffered to have umbrellas held over them by &s;ervants, but mu&s;t do that office them|&s;elves, to keep off &s;un or rain. The laws are &s;o well obeyed that robbery and murder are &s;carce ever heard of among them, which may be owing, in great mea&s;ure, to the manner of executing crimi|nals, which is very cruel; for they &s;trip them &s;tark naked, and then, tied hands and feet, expo&s;e them on the &s;ands to the &s;corching of the &s;un, and &s;ting|ing of the flies, where they die a mo&s;t mi&s;erable death. A late author informs us, that this coun|try is generally governed by a lady, who may mar|ry whom &s;he plea&s;es; but her hu&s;band never gets the title of rajah, although, if he has &s;ons, the elde&s;t of them does: yet neither hu&s;band nor &s;on has any thing to do with the management of affairs while &s;he lives. The principal places in Kanara are Bedmur, Bednour, or Baydour, two days jour|ney from the &s;ea-coa&s;t; Onar or Onor, the mo&s;t northern town of the country, &s;ituated at the mouth of a river capable of receiving &s;hips of two or three hundred tuns; Batakola, &s;ituated on a little river,
<PB N="240" REF="2410">
four miles from the &s;ea; Bar&s;eloar, &s;tanding on the banks of a broad river, about four miles from the &s;ea, where the Dutch have a factory; Bakkanoar and Molkey, both on the &s;ea-coa&s;t, to the &s;outh of Bar&s;eloar; and Mangulore, the greate&s;t mart for trade in all the Kanara dominions. The Por|tugue&s;e have a factory for rice here. The fields bear two crops of corn yearly; and the higher grounds produce pepper, betel nuts, &s;andal wood, or &s;anders, iron and &s;teel, which create a good trade. About five leagues to the &s;outh of Mangulore is a &s;mall &s;ea-port, called Manguzir.</P>
<P>Malabar, which gives name to the whole &s;outh-we&s;t coa&s;t, taken in its large&s;t &s;en&s;e, contains not only the country under that name to the we&s;t of Cape Komori or Komorin, but al&s;o tho&s;e to the ea&s;t, as far as Negapatam; for &s;o far the inhabi|tants are called Malabars, and the Malabar tongue extends a great way beyond, within the kingdom of Karnata. Taken in the more contracted and modern &s;en&s;e of the word, Malabar includes on|ly the country &s;o called to the we&s;t of Cape Ko|mori, otherwi&s;e denominated the dominion of the Samorin. This country begins at a &s;mall river a|bout a dozen leagues to the &s;outh of Mangulore, and ends at Cape Komori, the mo&s;t &s;outhern point of the penin&s;ula, taking up the &s;pace of about three hundred and fifty miles. Its greate&s;t breadth is about eighty miles, but in &s;ome places it is not more than twenty broad. It is wa&s;hed by the &s;ea on the we&s;t; and, on the ea&s;t, is bounded by the mountains of G&acirc;tti or G&acirc;te, which divide it from the dominions of Me&s;&s;&ucirc;r and Madura.</P>
<P>The air all over Malabar is good, the coa&s;t de|lightful, and the &s;oil one of the mo&s;t fruitful in all A&s;ia, affording two crops a year; yet rice is not ve|ry plentiful, much being imported from Kanara: but the coa&s;t being low and &s;andy, it produces
<PB N="241" REF="2420">
great quantities of cocoa-nuts, betel, and arekka trees, who&s;e fruit brings in much riches from abroad. Here are likewi&s;e &s;tore of other &s;pecies, excellent in their kind, but very different from tho&s;e of Eu|rope; &s;uch as the jakka, of a prodigious bulk: its fruit is divided into many partitions, which contain a &s;ub&s;tance of a yellow colour and ta&s;te, like that of melons, inclo&s;ing a &s;ort of che&s;nuts, which are the &s;eed. The mango is a much more excellent fruit, re&s;embling the nectarine. They are of different colours, when ripe, as red, white, and green; &s;ome the &s;ize of an egg, others bigger than the large&s;t pears. The &s;kin is hard, and the pulp &s;oft: they are excellent either to pre&s;erve or pickle; but the Malabar mangos are the wor&s;t of any in the Indies: tho&s;e towards Surat are better; and tho&s;e of Goa be&s;t of all.</P>
<P>The higher grounds produce pepper and carda|mums, which, we are told, grow no where in the world, except in the kingdom of Kannanor, &s;ix or &s;even leagues from the coa&s;t. They need neither &s;ow nor plant it; it is enough, after the rainy &s;ea|&s;on, to burn the herbs, which grow on the &s;pot, who&s;e a&s;hes produce this grain, which is the grand &s;ea&s;oning of the ea&s;tern countries. Cinnamon grows on the Malabar coa&s;t, but it is not compa|rable to that of Ceylon. The arbor de reys, ba|niyan, or war-tree, is no where &s;o plenty as in this country. The mountains yield iron and &s;teel, but not &s;o good as the European. Their woods, be&s;ides &s;tore of game, furni&s;h teak-timber and angelique for building; &s;andal wood, or &s;aunders, white and yellow; ca&s;&s;ia-fi&s;tula, nux-vomica, coculus Indiae, and other drugs, in plenty. The &s;oil, likewi&s;e, produces all &s;orts of pul&s;e, and, among the re&s;t, beans four inches long, inclo&s;ed in a pod a foot and a half in length; but they are only u&s;ed
<PB N="242" REF="2430">
by the poorer &s;ort of people, as having no good ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Malabar abounds with fowl, wild and tame, the &s;ame as in other parts of the Indies; likewi&s;e with tygers of the three &s;orts already mentioned; jackals, or addives, buffaloes, civet-cats, and monkies: but no animal is &s;o noxious in this country as the adders, e&s;pecially a green kind, who&s;e poi&s;on is in|curable. Some, though long, are very &s;mall; tho&s;e of the large&s;t &s;ize are near twenty feet long, and of &s;o va&s;t a thickne&s;s, that they are able to &s;wallow a man: but they are le&s;s dangerous than the other &s;ort, becau&s;e they are &s;ooner di&s;covered, and more ea&s;ily avoided.</P>
<P>The country of Malabar was formerly united under one emperor, called the &s;amorin: but, at pre&s;ent, it is divided into many &s;mall principalities, mo&s;t of which are independent.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that although cities and towns are frequent enough in Malabar, yet there are no villages to be &s;een all over it, every one having his &s;eparate habitation and enclo&s;ure in the coun|try; and, as it is an e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;tom among them not to make u&s;e of their neighbour's water, every hou&s;e, that does not &s;tand by the &s;ide of a ri|ver, has a well of its own.</P>

<HEAD>The mo&s;t remarkable places in Malabar are,</HEAD>
<P>Kannamore, a Dutch factory and fort, built on a point of land almo&s;t &s;urrounded by the &s;ea. Not far from it is a pretty large town belonging to Ad|dah Rajah, a Mohammedan prince, who can bring twenty thou&s;and men into the field. His domi|nions reach about ten miles to the &s;outh of Kanna|more to Tillecheri river, near which he has a harbour called Dormepatam.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="2440">
Tillicheri, where the Engli&s;h have a &s;mall &s;ettle|ment, keeping a con&s;tant garri&s;on of thirty or forty &s;oldiers. The town is inclo&s;ed with a &s;tone|wall, and &s;tands behind the fort, within land. The religion of the town and country round is pagan|i&s;m, but there are a few black Chri&s;tians that live under the protection of the factory. The coin here is all gold; and of this, as of the other Ma|labar &s;ettlements, the chief trade con&s;i&s;ts in pepper and cardamums. The petty princes here abouts are called mayers.</P>
<P>Burgara, a &s;ea port, belonging to a con&s;iderable prince, who&s;e country produces pepper, and the be&s;t cardamums in the world.</P>
<P>Kota, Kottika, or Kognali, a bazar or market-town, to the &s;outh of Burgara.</P>
<P>Tikorey, to the &s;outh of Kota.</P>
<P>Kalekut, &s;everal leagues to the &s;outh, where the French and Portugue&s;e have &s;mall factories. The neighbouring country produces pepper in abun|dance, betel, and cocoa-nuts, iron, &s;andal-wood, ca&s;&s;ia lignum, and timber for building; which commodities are exported to advantage. Gold|du&s;t al&s;o is &s;aid to be found here among the &s;ands on the &s;ea-&s;hore.</P>

<HEAD>NAME, BOUNDARIES, and EXTENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE mo&s;t antient name of Per&s;ia is that by which it is called by Mo&s;es, viz. Elam, or, as &s;ome write it, Aelam, from Elam the &s;on of Shem, the father of its fir&s;t inhabitants. In the books of Daniel, E&s;dras, &amp;c. we find it call|ed P&aacute;ras, agreeable to the Per&s;ian denomination of Pars or Phars, by which the proper Per&s;ia is called at this day. Some authors derive the word P&aacute;ras from the Arabic ph&acirc;ris, which &s;ignifies a hor&s;e, the Per&s;ian troops being mo&s;tly hor&s;e. Some Per|&s;ian hi&s;torians &s;ay, that Phars is a proper name, and that the per&s;on &s;o called was the &s;on of Ar&s;ham, i. e. Arphaxad, the &s;on of Shem: others make this Phars the &s;on of Japhet, &amp;c. Some again, who &s;eem to be neare&s;t the truth, &s;ay, that he was the
<PB N="248" REF="2490">
&s;on of Elam, the &s;on of Shem. It is evident, how|ever, that the Greek name Per&s;is, and the Latin Per&s;ia, are derived from this Oriental denomina|tion, and not from this country's being conquered by Per&s;eus. Another antient name of Per&s;ia was Ar|taea, which is thought to be derived from the Per|&s;ian word ard or art, which &s;ignifies &s;trong, brave, magnanimous; intimating, that the people of this country were &s;uch in their di&s;po&s;itions. In the Armenian language, Per&s;ia is &s;tiled Shahi&s;t&acirc;n, i. e. the Country of the Shah. The Arabians give the name of Ageme&s;laan to Per&s;ia, becau&s;e, in their language, agem, or agjem, &s;ignifies &s;tranger, or rather barbarian, which, with great mode&s;ty, they impo&s;e on every other nation but their own: hence the di&s;tinction of Arak or Ir&acirc;ck, Arab, and A|rak, or Ir&acirc;k-Agem, which &s;ignifies as much as the towns of the Arabs, and the towns of the Barba|rians. The Per&s;ians them&s;elves call their country generally Iroun, and Iran, which name, they &s;ay, was fir&s;t given it by their king Effra&s;iab, who, di|viding his mighty empire into two parts, called that on the other &s;ide the river Oxus Tauran, and that on this &s;ide Iran; i. e. on the other &s;ide the river, and that on this &s;ide of the river: whence, in the antient Per&s;ian hi&s;tories, Key-Iran, and Key-Touran, &s;ignified the king of Per&s;ia, and the king of Tartary. At this day the Per&s;ian monarch is &s;tiled Padcha-Iran, and the grand-vizier of Per&s;ia Iran-Medary, i. e. the Pole of Per&s;ia.</P>
<P>With regard to the extent of this empire, in an|tient times, it reached, in length, from the Helle&s;|pont to the mouth of the river Indus, about two thou&s;and eight hundred Engli&s;h miles; and, in breadth, from Pontus to the mouth of the Arabian Gulph, about two thou&s;and miles. The modern Per&s;ia, i. e. the dominions of the crown of Per&s;ia, extend, from the mouth of the river Araxes to the
<PB N="249" REF="2500">
mouth of the river Indus, about eight hundred and forty of our miles; and from the river Oxus to the Per&s;ian Gulph, about one thou&s;and and eighty of our miles: or, according to Sir John Chardin, from Georgia, i. e. from the 45&deg; of la|titude to the 80th, and from the river Indus to the mountains of Ararat, that is, from the 77th to the 112th degree of longitude; containing, in length, five hundred and fifty Per&s;ian leagues, (which makes &s;even hundred and fifty French leagues) and in breadth about four hundred: bounded thus, on the north by the Ca&s;pian Sea, the river Oxus, and Mount Cauca&s;&s;us; on the ea&s;t by the river In|dus, and the dominions of the great mogul, as he is commonly called; on the &s;outh by the Per&s;ian Gulph, and the Indian Ocean; and on the we&s;t by the dominions of the grand &s;eignior.</P>

<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, PRODUCE, MOUNTAINS, SEAS, LAKES, and RIVERS.</HEAD>
<P>As to the air and climate of this country, con&s;i|dering the great extent thereof, it cannot but be very different, according to the &s;ituation of its &s;e|veral parts; &s;ome being frozen with cold, whil&s;t others are burnt with heat at the &s;ame time of the year. The air, wherever it is cold, is dry; but, where it is extremely hot, it is &s;ometimes moi&s;t. All along the coa&s;t of the Per&s;ian Gulph, from we&s;t to ea&s;t, to the very mouth of the river Indus, the heat for four months is &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, that even tho&s;e who are born in the country, unable to bear it, are forced to quit their hou&s;es, and retire to the moun|tains;
<PB N="250" REF="2510">
&s;o that &s;uch as travel in the&s;e parts, at that &s;ea&s;on, find none in the villages but wretched poor creatures, left there to watch the effects of the rich, at the expence of their own health. The extreme heat of the air, as it is in&s;upportable, &s;o it makes it prodigiou&s;ly unwhole&s;ome; &s;trangers frequently falling &s;ick there, and &s;eldom e&s;caping. The ea&s;tern provinces of Per&s;ia, from the river Indus to the borders of Tartary, are &s;ubject to great heats, though not quite &s;o unwhole&s;ome as on the coa&s;ts of the Indian Ocean, and the Per&s;ian Gulph; but in the northern provinces, on the coa&s;t of the Ca&s;|pian &s;ea, the heat is full as great, and, though at|tended with moi&s;ture, as unwhole&s;ome as on the coa&s;t before mentioned. From October to May, there is no country in the world more plea&s;ant than this; but the people carry indelible marks of the malign influence of their &s;ummers, looking all of them of a faint yellow, and having neither &s;trength nor &s;pirits, though about the end of April they abandon their hou&s;es, and retire to the mountains, which are twenty-five or thirty leagues from the &s;ea. But this moi&s;tne&s;s in the air is only in the&s;e parts: the re&s;t of Per&s;ia enjoys a dry air, the &s;ky being per|fectly &s;erene, and hardly &s;o much as a cloud &s;een to fly therein. Though it &s;eldom rains, it does not follow that the heat admits of no mitigation; for in the night, notwith&s;tanding there is not a cloud to be &s;een, and the &s;ky is &s;o clear, that the &s;tars alone afford a light &s;ufficient to travel by, a bri&s;k wind &s;prings up, which la&s;ts until within an hour of the morning, and gives &s;uch a coolne&s;s to the air that a man can di&s;pen&s;e with a tolerable warm garment. The &s;ea&s;ons in general, and particularly in the middle of this kingdom, happen thus: the winter, beginning in November, and la&s;ting until March, is very &s;harp and rude, attended with fro&s;t and &s;now, which la&s;t de&s;cends in great flakes on the
<PB N="251" REF="2520">
mountains, but never in the plains. There are mountains, three days journey to the we&s;t of Spau|hawn or I&s;pahan, on which the &s;now lies for eight months in the year. From the month of March to that of May there are bri&s;k winds; from May to September the air is &s;erene and dry, refre&s;hed by plea&s;ant gales, which blow in the night, at evening and morning; and, in September and November, the wind blows as in the &s;pring. It is to be ob|&s;erved, that in &s;ummer the nights are about ten hours long, the twilight being very &s;hort; which, joined to the coolne&s;s of the night, renders the heat of the day &s;o moderate, that this &s;ea&s;on is as &s;up|portable at Spauhawn as at Paris. The great dry|ne&s;s of the air exempts Per&s;ia from thunder and earthquakes. In the &s;pring, indeed, there &s;ome|times falls hail; and, as the harve&s;t is then pretty far advanced, it does a great deal of mi&s;chief. The rainbow is &s;eldom &s;een in this country, becau&s;e there ri&s;e not vapours &s;ufficient to form it; but in the night there are &s;een rays of light &s;hoot|ing through the firmament, and followed, as it were, by a train of &s;moke. The winds, however bri&s;k, &s;eldom &s;well into &s;torms or tempe&s;ts; but, on the other hand, they are &s;ometimes poi&s;onous and infectious on the &s;hore of the gulph, as all tra|vellers agree. Mr. Tavernier &s;ays, that at Gom|broon people often find them&s;elves &s;truck by a &s;outh wind, in &s;uch a manner that they cry "I burn," and immediately fall down dead. M. le Brun tells us, that he was a&s;&s;ured while he was there, that the weather was &s;ometimes &s;o exce&s;&s;ively &s;ultry as to melt the &s;eals of letters. At this time the people go in their &s;hirts, and are continually &s;prinkled with cold water; and &s;ome even lie &s;everal hours naked in the water. Among the inconveniencies con&s;equent from this malign di&s;po&s;ition of the air, one of the mo&s;t terrible is the engendering
<PB N="252" REF="2530">
in the arms and legs, a kind of long &s;mall worms, which cannot be extracted without great danger of breaking them, upon which a mortification en&s;ues.</P>
<P>The &s;oil of Per&s;ia is in general &s;tony, &s;andy, barren, and every where &s;o dry, that, if it be not watered, it produces nothing, not even gra&s;s; but, where they can turn the water into their plains and vallies, it is not unfruitful. There is a great diffe|rence in point of fertility, in the different provinces of the empire; and tho&s;e of Media, Iberia, Hyrca|nia, and Bactria, are now, in a great mea&s;ure, what they were formerly, and &s;urpa&s;s mo&s;t of the others in their productions. All along the Per&s;ian Gulph, the &s;oil is &s;till more barren, cattle le&s;s plenty, and every thing in a wor&s;e condition than any where el&s;e.</P>
<P>Among the trees that are mo&s;t common in Per|&s;ia, we may reckon the plantain, the willow, the fir, and cornel, by the Arabs called &s;eder, and co|nar by the Per&s;ians; from whence, probably, came the Latin cornus, and our cornel. It is a received opinion here, that the plantain has a &s;ingular virtue again&s;t the plague, and all other infectious di&s;ea&s;es; and they po&s;itively a&s;&s;ert, that there has been no contagion at Spauhawn &s;ince the planting va&s;t num|bers of the&s;e trees in its &s;treets and gardens. The tree that bears gall-nuts grows in &s;everal parts of Per&s;ia, but particularly in Kourde&s;tan. The trees which produce gums, ma&s;tic, and incen&s;e, are found very common in mo&s;t parts of Per&s;ia: that, however, which bears incen&s;e, is particularly &s;ound in Carmania the De&s;ert, re&s;embling in form a large pear-tree: turpentine trees and almond trees, with the wild che&s;nut, are common: the tree which bears manna is al&s;o frequent; but there are &s;everal &s;orts of manna in Per&s;ia, the be&s;t being of a yellowi&s;h colour, and of a large grain. It comes from Nichapour, which is a part of Bactria. There is another &s;ort, called the
<PB N="253" REF="2540">
manna of tamari&s;k, becau&s;e it is gathered from that tree. All the different kinds of manna are u&s;ed to the &s;ame end in medicine, and are therefore gathered with the &s;ame care, being e&s;teemed a va|luable commodity, as well as one ea&s;ily di&s;po&s;ed of. The herbs in Per&s;ia, e&s;pecially &s;uch as are aromatic, exceed tho&s;e of mo&s;t other countries: roots, pul&s;e, and &s;allading, are larger, fairer, and better ta&s;ted than el&s;ewhere; and are eaten raw, without danger of creating any crudities in the &s;tomach. Mo&s;t of our European roots, greens, &amp;c. flouri&s;h here in great perfection. As to drugs, Per&s;ia produces as many as any country in A&s;ia; for be&s;ides manna, ca&s;&s;ia, &s;ena, and the nux-vomica, common in mo&s;t provinces, gum-ammoniac, by the Per&s;ians called ou&s;cioc, is found in abundance on the confines of Parthia, towards the &s;outh. Rhubarb grows com|monly in Chora&s;&s;an, or the antient Sogdiana; but it is not &s;o good as that which is brought from the country of the Tartars, between the Ca&s;pian Sea and China; and, for this rea&s;on, they endeavour to confound both under the name of revendtchini, i. e. rhubarb of China. In Chora&s;&s;an they eat it commonly, as we do beet-roots. The poppy of Per&s;ia is e&s;teemed the fine&s;t in the world; not only in re&s;pect of its beauty, but becau&s;e its juice is by far &s;tronger than the juice of the &s;ame plant el&s;ewhere. The Per&s;ians call this juice afioun, from whence our word opium: the be&s;t is made in the territory of Lingan, &s;ix miles from Spauhawn; though others prefer the afioun of Cazaron, which is towards the Per&s;ian Gulph, as being le&s;s apt to engender cru|dities in the &s;tomach. Tobacco grows all over Per&s;ia, e&s;pecially about Hammedan, which is the antient Su&s;a, and in Courde&s;tan, near the Per&s;ian Gulph, which is e&s;teemed the fine&s;t. Saffron is cul|tivated in many provinces, and e&s;pecially about the Ca&s;pian Sea and in the neighbourhood of Hamme|dan,
<PB N="254" REF="2550">
and is much e&s;teemed. The plant by the Per|&s;ians called hiltel, and &s;uppo&s;ed to be the la&s;erpiti|um, or &s;ilphium, of Dio&s;corides, from whence drops the a&s;&s;a etida, is common every where, but abounds mo&s;t in Chora&s;&s;an. There are two &s;orts of it, the whire and black: the white is le&s;s e&s;teemed, becau&s;e le&s;s &s;trong than the black. This juice or gum is, all over the Ea&s;t, called king; and the Indians con&s;ume va&s;t quantities of it, mixing it in all their ragouts and &s;auces. It has by far the &s;tronge&s;t odour of any thing hitherto di&s;covered; &s;ince piaces where it has been kept will retain its &s;cent for whole years, and the ve&s;&s;els in which it is tran&s;ported to India are &s;o thoroughly impregnated therewith, that no other goods can be put on board without acquiring its &s;cent, however clo&s;e packed. Mummy, of both &s;orts, is a Per&s;ian commodity: the one is taken from embalmed bodies, or &s;uch as are dried in the &s;ands; and the other is a precious gum, which di&s;tils out of a rock. There are two mines or &s;ources of it in Per&s;ia: the one in Carma|nia the De&s;ert, in the country of Sar, which is the be&s;t; for it is certain, that there is no brui&s;e, cut, or wound, which a drachm of this excellent gum will not cure in twenty-four hours. The other mine is in Chora&s;&s;an: the rocks, whence it di&s;tils, belong to the king, and all that i&s;&s;ues from thence is for his u&s;e. They are inclo&s;ed within walls, the gates of which are &s;ealed by the five prin|cipal officers of the province. Once a-year, each mine is opened in their pre&s;ence; and all the mum|my that is then found, or at lea&s;t the greate&s;t part of it, is &s;ent to the king's trea&s;ure. It derives its name from the Per&s;ian word moum, which &s;igni|fies literally an unguent. The Jews and Arabs make u&s;e of the &s;ame term. The Per&s;ians &s;ay, the prophet Daniel taught them the u&s;e and prepara|tion of mummy. Cotton is very common over all
<PB N="255" REF="2560">
Per&s;ia; but there is a tree which &s;omewhat re&s;em|bles it, but is by far more rare, which produces a &s;ort of &s;ilk, very fine and &s;oft, and of which many u&s;es are made. Galbanum is likewi&s;e very common in this country, together with the vegetable alkali, and many other drugs, which we have no room here to particularize.</P>
<P>With regard to the fruits of Per&s;ia, melons cer|tainly claim the fir&s;t place: they have above twenty different &s;orts here; of all which great quantities are con&s;umed, e&s;pecially by the common people, as they are accounted very whole&s;ome. After the melon, the rai&s;in de&s;erves our notice, of which there are twelve or fourteen &s;orts in Per&s;ia: the mo&s;t e&s;teem|edare the violet, the red, and the black: they are &s;o large, that one of them is a good mouthful. The be&s;t grapes in the neighbourhood of Spauhawn are found on the vines belonging to the Gaurs; for they being permitted by their religion to drink wine, take the more pains to cultivate their trees, which, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, are neglected by the Mohammedan Per&s;ians. The dates of Per&s;ia are, without compari&s;on, the riche&s;t in the world; their &s;yrup being &s;weeter than virgin honey. The be&s;t grow in Courde&s;tan, Si&s;tan, about Per&s;epolis, and the &s;hore of the Per&s;ian Gulph, and particularly at Jaron, a town on the road between Schiras and Lar. Strangers ought to eat very moderately of this fruit, otherwi&s;e, it is apt to overheat the blood, &s;ometimes to &s;uch a degree as to create ulcers; but the inhabitants never feel any &s;uch inconvenience. Dates grow in clu&s;ters on the palm-tree, which is the highe&s;t of all fruit-bearing trees, and has no branches but at the very top: it produces fruit at fifteen years growth, and continues bearing until it is two hundred years old. When young, and be|fore it bears fruit, they dig on one &s;ide of it, eight or ten fathom deep in the earth, until they find
<PB N="256" REF="2570">
water; then the hole is filled up with pigeons dung, of which they have always great quantities, from the va&s;t number of tame pigeons kept chiefly for the &s;ake of their dung, which &s;erves both to manure the ground, and make hot-beds for rai&s;ing melons. It is &s;aid, that if they did not take that cour&s;e with the palm trees they would not bear good fruit: but there is &s;omething very curi|ous ob&s;erved in the cultivation of this tree, which is their taking every year, when the palm trees are in blo&s;&s;om, the blo&s;&s;oms of the male palm tree, and putting two or three bunches of them into the matrix of each female, when they begin to blow. If this was not done, they would produce dates with only &s;kin, and &s;tone without any pulp. The matrix is that bud which contains the flowers, from which, in proce&s;s of time, the dates are formed, The time of making this impregnation is about the end of November; not but that the male palm tree al&s;o bears fruit, but, being good for no|thing, they therefore take all their blo&s;&s;oms for im|pregnating the female. The Per&s;ian apricots are very delicious, and their peaches large and good. Nectarines and peaches &s;ometimes weigh eighteen ounces each: they break ea&s;ily, and, what is very extraordinary, the &s;tone opens at the &s;ame time the peach is broken, and di&s;covers a kernel extreme|ly white, and of a ta&s;te the mo&s;t delicious that can be imagined. The Per&s;ian pomegranates grow of &s;everal colours, in the highe&s;t perfection; &s;ome of them weighing a whole pound. As to the particular places where the &s;everal kinds of fruit are held mo&s;t excellent, the apples and pears of Iberia or Gurge&s;|tan, the dates of Caramania, the pomegranates and grapes about Scheras, and the oranges of Hyrca|nia, are highly prized. Bactria produces all &s;orts of fruit, finer and fairer than any other country in the world; but it is particularly renowned for its
<PB N="257" REF="2580">
onions, at once prodigiou&s;ly large, and &s;weet as apples. Pi&s;taches, almonds, hazels, filberts, and figs, abound here likewi&s;e; and Sir John Char|din tells us, that at an entertainment near Spau|hawn, he &s;aw fifty different &s;orts of fruit provided for one de&s;ert.</P>
<P>Though there is &s;carce a province in Per&s;ia which does not produce wine, yet the wine of &s;ome pro|vinces is much more e&s;teemed than that of others: but Schiras wine is univer&s;ally allowed to be the very be&s;t in Per&s;ia; in&s;omuch, that it is a common pro|verb there, that to live happily one mu&s;t eat the bread of Yezd, and drink the wine of Schiras.</P>
<P>The grain mo&s;t common in Per&s;ia is wheat, which is wonderfully fair and clean. As for bar|ley, rice, and millet, they only make bread of them in &s;ome places, as in Courde&s;tan, when their wheat bread is exhau&s;ted, before the return of har|ve&s;t. They do not cultivate in this country either oats or rye, except where the Armenians are &s;et|tled, who make great u&s;e of the latter in Lent. Rice is the univer&s;al aliment of all &s;orts of people in Per&s;ia: for this rea&s;on they are extremely care|ful in its cultivation; for, after they have &s;own it in the &s;ame manner as other grain, they, in three months time, tran&s;plant it, root by root, into fields, which are well watered, otherwi&s;e, it would never attain that perfection in which we find it there; &s;ince it is &s;ofter, &s;ooner boiled, and more delicious, than the &s;ame grain in any other part of the world. Perhaps its ta&s;te is, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, heightened by a practice they make u&s;e of to give it a glo&s;&s;y whitene&s;s, viz. by clean&s;ing it, after its being beaten out of the hu&s;ks, with a mixture of flour and &s;alt. Corn ripens exceedingly in this country; &s;o that, in &s;ome parts, they have a threefold crop in the year. The Per&s;ian bread is generally very thin, white, and good, and commonly cheap enough.</P>

There are in Per&s;ia, e&s;pecially in the inland and northern provinces, all the &s;orts of flowers that are to be found in Europe, with many others. In Hyr|cania are whole fore&s;ts of oranges, with &s;ingle and double je&s;&s;amin, be&s;ides the European fiowers. The mo&s;t ea&s;tern part of this country, which is called Mazanderan, is a perfect parterre, from September to the end of April, the whole country being covered with flowers, as with a carpet. To|wards the frontiers of Arabia the fields are adorned with tulips, anemonies, and ranunculu&s;es, of the brighte&s;t red, all &s;pontaneous. In the neighbour|hood of Spauhawn, jonquils grow wild, and conti|nue all the winter. Ro&s;es of an uncommon beauty are frequent in this country, the bu&s;hes bearing often three different coloured ro&s;es on one branch, viz. yellow, yellow and black, and red.</P>
<P>Metals of all &s;orts have been found in Per&s;ia. Since the reign of &s;hah Abas the Great, iron, copper, and lead, have been very common; but there are no gold or &s;ilver mines open at pre&s;ent, though, as Per&s;ia is a very mountainous country, &s;uch might very probably be found, if pains were taken to &s;earch them out. There are &s;ilver mines in Kirman and Mazanderan, and one not far from Spauhawn; but they cannot be worked for want of wood. Minerals are al&s;o found in Per&s;ia, in abun|dance; e&s;pecially &s;ulphur, &s;altpetre, &s;alt, and alum. Nothing is more common in this country than to meet with plains, &s;ometimes ten leagues in length, covered entirely with &s;alt, and others with &s;ulphur or alum. In &s;ome places &s;alt is dug out of mines, and even u&s;ed in building hou&s;es. Marble, free|&s;tone, and &s;late, are found in great plenty about Hammadan. The marble is of four colours, viz. white, black, red and black, and white and black. Per&s;ia yields two &s;orts of petroleum or napthe, namely, black, and white. In the neighbourhood
<PB N="259" REF="2600">
of Tauris they find azure; but it is not &s;o good as that brought from Tartary. Among the mo&s;t va|luable productions of Per&s;ia, are the precious &s;tones called torquoi&s;es, of which there are &s;everal rocks or mines.</P>
<P>The hor&s;es of Per&s;ia are the mo&s;t beautiful of the Ea&s;t, though they are not &s;o much e&s;teemed as tho&s;e of Arabia: &s;o great, however, is the demand for them, that the fine&s;t ones will fetch from ninety to four hundred and fifty pounds &s;terling. They are higher than the Engli&s;h &s;addle-hor&s;es, &s;treight before, with a &s;mall head, legs wonderfully &s;lender, and finely proportioned: they are mighty gentle, good travellers, very light and &s;prightly, and do good &s;ervice till they are eighteen or twenty years old. The great numbers of them &s;old into Turky and the Indies, though none can be carried out of the kingdom without &s;pecial licence from the king, is what makes them &s;o dear. Next to hor&s;es, we may reckon mules, which are much e&s;teemed here, and are very fine: and next to the&s;e we may ju&s;tly place a&s;&s;es, of which they have in this country two &s;orts; the fir&s;t bred in Per&s;ia, heavy and dolti&s;h, as a&s;&s;es in other countries are, the other originally of an Arabian breed, the mo&s;t docile and u&s;eful crea|ture of its kind in the world. They are u&s;ed wholly for the &s;addle, being remarkable for their ea&s;y manner of going, and are very &s;ure footed, car|rying their heads lofty, and moving gracefully. Some of them are valued at twenty pounds &s;terling. The mules here are al&s;o very fine; they pace well, never fall, and are &s;eldom tired. The highe&s;t price of a mule is about forty-five pounds &s;terling. Camels are numerous in Per&s;ia, and very &s;erviceable: they call them kechty-krouch-konion, i. e. the &s;hips of the land; becau&s;e the inland trade is carried on by them, as the foreign is by &s;hips. Of the&s;e camels there are two &s;orts, the northern and &s;outhern:
<PB N="260" REF="2610">
the latter, which is much the &s;maller, but &s;wifter, will carry a load of about &s;even hundred weight, and trot as fa&s;t as a hor&s;e will gallop; the other will travel with a load of twelve or thirteen hundred weight: both are profitable to their ma&s;ters, as co&s;ting little or nothing to keep. They travel without halter or reins; grazing on the road, from time to time, notwith&s;tanding their load. They are managed entirely by the voice; tho&s;e who di|rect them making u&s;e of a kind of &s;ong, and the camel moving bri&s;ker, or at its ordinary pace, as they keep a quicker or &s;lower time. The camels &s;hed their hair &s;o clean in the &s;pring that they look like &s;calded &s;wine; but then they are pitched over, to keep the flies from &s;tinging them. The camels hair is the mo&s;t profitable fleece of all the tame bea&s;ts: fine &s;tuffs are made of it, and in Europe hats, with a mixture of a little beaver. When the camel is in love, the Per&s;ians are obliged to in|crea&s;e his load, otherwi&s;e he would be ungoverna|ble.</P>
<P>As beef is little eaten in Per&s;ia, their oxen are ge|nerally employed in ploughing, and other &s;orts of labour. Hogs are no where bred in Per&s;ia, if we except a province or two on the borders of the Ca&s;pian Sea. Sheep and deer are very common throughout all Per&s;ia.</P>
<P>Of wild bea&s;ts, the number is not great in that country, becau&s;e there are few fore&s;ts; but where there are any, as in Hyrcania, now called Tabri&s;tan, abundance of lions, bears, tigers, leopards, porcu|pines, wild boars, and wolves are to be found; but the la&s;t are not &s;o numerous as any of the other &s;pecies. The bea&s;t called chacal, or jackal, which roars hide|ou&s;ly, and is &s;o very greedy after dead bodies, that it digs them out of the graves, unle&s;s &s;ome per&s;on is &s;et to watch them, is &s;een almo&s;t every where. Gazels are common here, and throughout the Ea&s;t:

&s;o many of the&s;e animals have been brought to Europe, that they need not any de&s;cription. There are but few in&s;ects in this country, which may be a&s;cribed to the dryne&s;s of the climate. In &s;ome provinces, however, there is an infinite number of locu&s;ts or gra&s;hoppers, which fly about in &s;uch clouds as to darken the air. In certain parts of the Per&s;ian dominions, they have large black &s;cor|pions, &s;o venomous, that &s;uch as are &s;tung by them die in a few hours. In others, they have li|zards, frightfully ugly, which are an ell long, and as thick as a large toad, their &s;kins being as hard and tough as that of the &s;ea-dog: they are &s;aid to attack and kill men &s;ometimes; but that may be doubted. The &s;outhern provinces are in|fe&s;ted with gnats, &s;ome with long legs, like tho&s;e we call midges; and &s;ome white, and as &s;mall as fleas, which make no buzzing, but &s;ting &s;uddenly, and &s;o &s;martly, that the &s;ting is like the prick of a nee|dle. Among the reptiles is a long &s;quare worm, called by the inhabitants hazar-pey, i. e. thou&s;and|feet, becau&s;e its whole body is covered with feet: it runs prodigiou&s;ly fa&s;t, and its bite is dangerous, and even mortal, if it gets into the ear.</P>
<P>There are in Per&s;ia all the &s;everal &s;orts of fowls which we have in Europe, but not in &s;uch great plenty; excepting, however, wild and tame pi|geons, of which va&s;t numbers are kept all over the kingdom, chiefly on account of their dung, which is the be&s;t manure for melons. It is a great diver|&s;ion among the lower &s;ort of people, in town and country, to catch pigeons, though it be forbidden: for this purpo&s;e, they have pigeons &s;o taught, that flying in one flock, they &s;urround &s;uch wild ones as they find in the field, and bring them back with them to their ma&s;ters. The partridges of this country are the large&s;t and fine&s;t in the world, be|ing generally of the &s;ize of our fowls. Gee&s;e,
<PB N="262" REF="2630">
ducks, cranes, herons, and many other &s;orts of wa|ter-fowl are common here; as are likewi&s;e nightin|gales, which are heard all the year, but chiefly in the &s;pring; martlets, which learn whatever words are taught them; and a bird called noura, which chatters ince&s;&s;antly, and repeats whatever it hears. Of birds of a larger &s;ize, the mo&s;t remarkable is the pelican, by the Per&s;ians called tacab, i e. water|carrier, and al&s;o mi&s;c, i. e. &s;heep, becau&s;e it is as large as one of tho&s;e animals. Its feathers are white and &s;oft, like tho&s;e of a goo&s;e; its head is much larger in proportion than its body; and its beak from eighteen to twenty-&s;ix inches long, and as thick as a man's arm; under the beak it has a &s;ack or pouch, in which it pre&s;erves a quantity of water for moi&s;tening its food: it u&s;ually re&s;ts this long beak on its back, which would otherwi&s;e in|commode it much. The pelican lives chiefly on fi&s;h, in taking of which it &s;hews an admirable &s;aga|city, by placing its beak in &s;uch a manner under the water as to catch them, as it were, in a net: when it opens its throat, the pa&s;&s;age is large enough for a lamb. It is called the water-carrier, becau&s;e it &s;ometimes, particularly in Arabia, makes her ne&s;t at &s;uch di&s;tance from water, that &s;he is obliged to fly two days journey for a &s;upply for her young, which &s;he brings in her pouch; and hence the fa|bles of the antients, of the pelican's tearing her brea&s;t open to feed her young. There are in Per|&s;ia various birds of prey. Some of their falcons are the large&s;t and fine&s;t in the world: the people take great pains to teach them to fly at game; the Per|&s;ian lords being great lovers of falconry, and the king having generally eight hundred of the&s;e &s;ort of birds, each of which has a per&s;on to attend it.</P>
<P>There is perhaps no country in the world which, generally &s;peaking, is more mountainous than Per|&s;ia; but many of them yield neither &s;prings nor
<PB N="263" REF="2640">
metals, and but few of them are &s;haded with trees. It is true, &s;ome of the chief of them are &s;ituated on the frontiers, and &s;erve as a kind of natural ram|parts, or bulwarks, to this va&s;t empire. Among the latter are the mountains of Cauca&s;us and A|rarat, &s;ometimes called the mountains of Daghe&s;tan, which fill all the i&s;thmus between the Euxine and Ca&s;pian Seas: tho&s;e called Taurus, and the &s;everal branches thereof, run through Per&s;ia, from Nato|lia to India, and fill all the middle of the country.</P>
<P>As to rivers, except the Araxes, which ri&s;es in the mountains of Armenia, and falls into the Kur or Cyrus, before it reaches the Ca&s;pian Sea, there is not one navigable &s;tream in this country. The Oxus divides Per&s;ia, on the north-ea&s;t, from U&s;beck Tar|tary. The Indus al&s;o may now be reckoned among the rivers of Per&s;ia, as the provinces ly|ing to the we&s;t of that river are now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that crown: this river is &s;aid to run a cour&s;e of more than a thou&s;and miles, and overflows all the low grounds in April, May, and June.</P>
<P>The &s;eas on the &s;outh of Per&s;ia are, the Gulph of Per&s;ia or Ba&s;&s;ora, the Gulph of Ormus, and the In|dian Ocean. The only &s;ea on the north is the Ca&s;|pian or Hyrcanian Sea, which is more properly a lake, having no communication with any other &s;ea. The&s;e &s;eas, together with the lakes and rivers, &s;up|ply Per&s;ia with plenty of fi&s;h. The Ca&s;pian Sea contains very fine fi&s;h, on one &s;ide; and the Per&s;ian Gulph, on the other, is believed to have more fi&s;h than any other &s;ea in the world. On the coa&s;ts of this Gulph is taken a &s;ort of fi&s;h, for which they have no particular name: its fle&s;h is of a red co|lour, very delicious, and &s;ome of them weigh two or three hundred pounds. The river fi&s;h are chiefly barbels, but far from being good. Tho&s;e of the lakes are carps and &s;hads. In the river at Spauhawn are a great number of crabs, which
<PB N="264" REF="2650">
crawl up the trees, and live night and day under the leaves, whence they are taken, and are e&s;teem|ed very delicious food.</P>
<P>We cannot di&s;mi&s;s this &s;ubject without &s;ome ob|&s;ervations on the Ca&s;pian Sea, which is the northern boundary of a great part of Per&s;ia. This large bo|dy of water was by the antients called indifferently the Ca&s;pian and Hyrcanian Sea, from the Ca&s;pians and Hyrcanians, who&s;e &s;hores it wa&s;hed: however, Pliny makes &s;ome difference between the&s;e two ap|pellations; telling us, that on the Ca&s;pian coa&s;ts it bears the former denomination, and on tho&s;e of Hyrcania, the latter. The ancient, and even the modern, geographers had but a very imperfect knowledge of the true &s;ituation, extent, coa&s;ts, and bays of this &s;ea, before the di&s;coveries made by Mr. Vanvarden, a very able navigator and geographer, who, by order of the czar Peter the Great, formed a very exact chart of the Ca&s;pian, from ob&s;ervations made by him on the &s;pot in 1720, 1721, 1722; and therefore, what has been &s;aid by others is only to be relied on &s;o far as it coincides with the accounts he has given. Pliny, and even Herodotus, knew that the Ca&s;pian was &s;urrounded on all &s;ides by land, without any communication with other &s;eas, or vi|&s;ible efflux; whence &s;ome thought, that it ought to be called a lake, rather than a &s;ea. However Stra|bo, Pliny, Pomponius Mela, and Arrian, wrote, that it was joined either to the Indian or Northern Ocean; but we are now well a&s;&s;ured, by experience, that they were mi&s;taken. They were perhaps led into this error by &s;uch as had made their ob&s;ervations when the Wolga had overflowed its banks, at which time it appears more like a &s;ea than a river, cover|ing with its waters, as a modern traveller informs us, the whole country, to the extent of &s;ixty miles: this they might ea&s;ily have mi&s;taken for a &s;treight joining the Ca&s;pian to the Ocean. Ptolemy, tho'
<PB N="265" REF="2660">
not guilty of this error, was greatly mi&s;taken as to its extent from ea&s;t to we&s;t; for he reckons it to have been about twenty-three degrees and an half; whereas it does not exceed, where wide&s;t, three de|grees forty-two minutes, and, where narrowe&s;t, one degree twenty-two minutes: he likewi&s;e places it three degrees more to the north than it really is. The&s;e mi&s;takes were ob&s;erved, and in &s;ome degree redre&s;&s;ed, in 1320, by Abu'lfeda, an Arabian prince, and able geographer, and more fully after|wards by Bourrous, Olearius, and Jenkin&s;on; but the true dimen&s;ions of this &s;ea were not a&s;certained, till the late ob&s;ervations above-mentioned, by which we are a&s;&s;ured, that it lies between the 37th and 48th degrees of north latitude, and does not exceed 3&deg;. 42&prime; in its greate&s;t longitude. The Per&s;ians call it Kul&s;um, or the Sea of A&s;tracan; the Ru&s;&s;ians, the Sea of Gualin&s;koi; the Georgians, Sowa; and the Armenians Soof. It receives the river Wolga, which it&s;elf is like a &s;ea, and near two hundred others, into its bo&s;om; and yet is never increa&s;ed or dimini&s;hed, nor ob&s;erved to ebb or flow. This con&s;tant plenitude has given ri&s;e to many &s;pecula|lations; and &s;ome have imagined, that it mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily have &s;ome &s;ubterraneous communication, either with the Black Sea, though an hundred leagues di&s;tant, or with the Per&s;ian Gulph, which is near two hundred leagues di&s;tant from it. Father Avril, a modern traveller, &s;eems to favour the latter opinion, and alledges this proof to confirm it, viz. that over-again&s;t the province of Xilan, in Per|&s;ia, there are two immen&s;e whirlpools, which, with an incredible rapidity and frightful noi&s;e, &s;uck in and &s;wallow whatever comes near them, and are con&s;equently cau&s;ed by &s;ome great cavity in the earth. He adds, that every year, about the latter end of the autumn, a great quantity of willow leaves are ob&s;erved floating on the water, by tho&s;e
<PB N="266" REF="2670">
who inhabit the coa&s;ts of the Per&s;ian Gulph; and, as this tree is no where to be found on the Per&s;ian Gulph, and, on the other hand, is very common on the coa&s;ts of the Ca&s;pian, towards the province of Xilan, he rightly concludes, that there mu&s;t be &s;ome &s;ubterraneous intercour&s;e between the&s;e &s;eas. The water of the Ca&s;pian is &s;alt, like that of other &s;eas, notwith&s;tanding the opinion of the antients to the contrary; and its fre&s;hne&s;s in &s;ome parts, near the &s;hore, is only owing to the rivers that di&s;charge them&s;elves into it. It is neither of a different co|lour from other &s;eas, nor without various &s;orts of fi&s;h, as Olearius, an eye-witne&s;s, a&s;&s;ures us, and thereby di&s;proves the opinion of the antients, who believed it to be of a blacki&s;h colour, and to have but one kind of fi&s;h, and that of a mon&s;trous form. As to its figure, it approaches to an oblong &s;quare, the longe&s;t &s;ide of which, from north to &s;outh, is about &s;ix hundred and forty Engli&s;h miles. Its greate&s;t breadth, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, is three hun|dred and ten miles; but in many places it is much narrower. On the we&s;t it is bounded by the kingdom of A&s;tracan, and by the provinces of Georgia and Schirwan; on the north by Ru&s;&s;ian Tartary; on the ea&s;t by U&s;beck Tartary, and part of A&s;trabad, which la&s;t, together with Tabri&s;tan and Ghilan, bound it on the &s;outh and &s;outh-ea&s;t. As to its con&s;tant equal fulne&s;s, that perhaps may be ac|counted for, by the great quantity of vapours ex|haled by the &s;un in this hot climate, which may po&s;&s;ibly balance the quantity of water di&s;charged into it by rivers. It was formerly very little navi|gated, except by Co&s;&s;ack rovers, who u&s;ed to plun|der all they met; but the Ru&s;&s;ians, being now ma&s;ters of a part of the coa&s;t, are continually &s;ail|ing from one part or other of it, and carry on a pro|fitable commerce with mo&s;t of the adjacent coun|tries.</P>

<HEAD>NATURAL and ARTIFICIAL RARITIES in Per&s;ia.</HEAD>
<P>Of the natural rarities, we &s;hall fir&s;t take notice of a certain poi&s;onous &s;hrub, or plant, by the Ara|bians, called chark, by the Per&s;ians gulbad-&s;a|mour, i. e. the wind-poi&s;oning-flower; it flowers like the thi&s;tle, and has pods filled with a thick white liquor, of the con&s;i&s;tence of cream, &s;harp, and &s;our to the ta&s;te; it is affirmed, that where|ever the wind blows over a number of the&s;e plants, as it does frequently in Carmania the De&s;ert, it thence contracts a poi&s;onous quality, which proves mortal to the next that breathes it. In the &s;ame province is another &s;hrub, which the Arabians, as well as the Per&s;ians, call kerzehre, or the poi&s;on of an a&s;s, becau&s;e tho&s;e creatures are apt to eat of its fruit, which generally proves mortal. The very water that wa&s;hes its roots is held to be poi&s;onous. It bears a &s;ort of flower exactly re&s;embling the ro&s;e, of a kind of fle&s;h colour: whence it is apprehended, that the Greeks called it rhododendron. Some are of opinion, that it is the nerium of our herbali&s;ts, and the &s;ame plant that is called in French ro&s;age. The goats, both wild and tame, that feed on the &s;hore of the Per&s;ian gulph, afford the bezoar &s;o much e&s;teemed in medicine; but the be&s;t is found in tho&s;e of Chora&s;&s;an, far excelling the bezoar of Golkonda, and the re&s;t of the Indies. In the core of the&s;e &s;tones is generally found one or more peb|bles, a little &s;prig of bramble, or other bu&s;h, &s;ome|times a thorn &s;tick, &amp;c. round which, by a con|tinual acce&s;&s;ion of matter, the ball, or bezoar, is formed. This &s;tone is here found in &s;heep as well as in goats; but it is not &s;o in the Indies. This &s;tone was formerly regarded as one of the &s;tronge&s;t counter-poi&s;ons; but, of late years, it is much &s;unk in its reputation, as well in the Ea&s;t as in Eu|rope, it being now chiefly u&s;ed as a &s;udorific. The
<PB N="268" REF="2690">
abmelec, or eater of locu&s;ts, or gra&s;hoppers, is a bird which better de&s;erves to be de&s;cribed, perhaps, than mo&s;t others of which travellers have given us an account. The facts relating to it, however &s;trange, are yet &s;o well atte&s;ted, that we cannot refu&s;e them our belief. The food of this creature is the locu&s;t or gra&s;hopper: it is of the &s;ize of a hen, its feathers black, and its wings large; they generally fly in flocks: but the thing that is mo&s;t remarkable in regard to them is, that they are &s;o fond of a cer|tain fountain in Chora&s;&s;an, or Bactria, that where|ever that water is carried, they follow, on which account it is carefully pre&s;erved; for, wherever the locu&s;ts fall, the Armenian prie&s;ts, who are pro|vided with this water, bring a quantity of it, and place it in jars, or pour it into little channels in the fields: the next day whole troops of the&s;e birds ar|rive, and quickly deliver the people from the lo|cu&s;ts. The river Mahmoudker is a &s;urprizing na|tural curio&s;ity. At &s;ome di&s;tance from Spauhawn there is a range of rocks, plain and even for a con|&s;iderable &s;pace, except that here and there they have openings, like the embra&s;ures in ba&s;tions. Through the&s;e rocks the river falls into a noble ba&s;on, partly wrought by the water it&s;elf, and partly formed by art. As one a&s;cends the moun|tain, the water is &s;een at the bottom of it like a &s;leeping lake, covered with rocks: it is thought to be unfathomable; and when &s;tones are thrown into it, they cau&s;e a mo&s;t amazing noi&s;e, which almo&s;t deafens the hearers. After its de&s;cent from the ba&s;on beforementioned, it rolls along the plain, till at la&s;t it falls into the river Zenderoud. Some are of opinion, that this river does not derive its water from &s;prings, but from the &s;now on the tops of the mountains, which melting gradually, di&s;tils through the chinks of the rocks into the va&s;t lake beforementioned. Under a certain mountain, called
<PB N="269" REF="2700">
Tagteru&s;tan, &s;o called from the ruins of a building on the &s;ummit thereof, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been erect|ed by the great Ru&s;tan, there runs a grotto, from the top of which there di&s;tils through the whole mountain, in two or three places, fre&s;h water, which falling into proper receptacles, forms two or three &s;treams, which i&s;&s;ue from thence to water the plain. In this grotto, about the beginning of April, a great number of Indians a&s;&s;emble to cele|brate a fea&s;t in honour of an hermit, or &s;aint of theirs, who lived long here; and the whole cave is full of &s;hreds, or rags of people's garments, who have come hither to be cured of their di&s;ea&s;es, and have found relief. Many other natural rari|ties might have been mentioned, but our propo&s;ed brevity obliged us to &s;elect only a few of the mo&s;t remarkable. Of the artificial rarities, the ruins of Per&s;epolis, the antient metropolis of Per&s;ia, are mo&s;t worthy of our notice. The&s;e ruins are to be &s;een in one of the fine&s;t plains of Per&s;ia, &s;urround|ed, in a great mea&s;ure, with a noble mound|work of rocks and mountains. The plain is about eighteen or nineteen leagues in length, and from &s;ix to two in breadth, containing between a thou&s;and and fifteen hundred villages, without reckoning tho&s;e in the mountains, adorned with plea&s;ant gar|dens, and planted with &s;hady trees. The river Araxes or Bendemer runs thro' it. The ruins of Per&s;epolis, the mo&s;t magnificent perhaps on the face of the earth, lying in the above plain, about thirty miles north of Schiras, would require much more room than we can &s;pare in this work to give but a &s;uperficial account of them, &s;uch is their number, grandeur, and variety: we mu&s;t therefore refer the reader to Sir John Chardin's and Mr. Le Brun's travels, and the Univer&s;al Hi&s;tory, vol. V. where his curio&s;ity on this head will be fully gra|tified. At about a leagues di&s;tance from the&s;e
<PB N="270" REF="2710">
ruins, there is a famous mountain, &s;eated between two fine plains, to which the inhabitants give &s;everal names, &s;tyling it &s;ometimes Kabra&s;ton-Gauron, i. e. the &s;epulchre of the Gaurs; &s;ometimes Nachs-Ru&s;tan, the pictures of Ru&s;tan; and &s;ometimes Takt-Ru&s;tan, i. e. the throne of Ru&s;tan. This Ru&s;tan is the Hercules of the Ea&s;t, or rather the Amadis; for the &s;tories they tell of him are alike fabulous and romantic. The mountain is an en|tire rock, harder, and capable of a better poli&s;h than marble; it is levelled by art; its &s;ides are perfectly perpendicular, &s;o that it looks like a large wall; and upon it are a variety of figures, re|pre&s;ented in bas relief, with great &s;kill and beauty. At a &s;mall di&s;tance from the&s;e figures are &s;everal tombs cut out of the rock, with two &s;mall edifices, and &s;everal in&s;criptions. Of the many curious re|pre&s;entations carved on this mountain, &s;ome are perfectly whole, others much defaced, either thro' the injuries of time and weather, or the brutal zeal of the Mohammedans, who think it very merito|rious to de&s;troy all kinds of imagery. Near Schiras are al&s;o &s;everal &s;tately remains of antiquity, toge|ther with a great many figures cut out of a rock.</P>

<HEAD>TRADE, MANUFACTURES, and COINS.</HEAD>
<P>The Engli&s;h, and other nations, trade with the Per&s;ians &s;everal ways, particularly by the Gulph of Ormus at Gombroon, and by the way of Turky. A trade al&s;o was not many years &s;ince opened by the Engli&s;h with Per&s;ia through Ru&s;&s;ia and the Ca&s;pian &s;ea; but that is now di&s;continued, having been prohibited by the court of Ru&s;&s;ia, who were apprehen&s;ive that the Engli&s;h would teach the Per|&s;ians to build &s;hips, and di&s;pute the naviga|tion of the Ca&s;pian &s;ea with them. The principal commodities and manufactures of Per&s;ia are, raw
<PB N="271" REF="2720">
and wrought &s;ilks, mohair, camblets, carpets, leather, for which, and &s;ome others, the Euro|pean merchants exchange chiefly woollen manu|factures; but the trade is carried on altogether in European &s;hipping, the Per&s;ians having &s;carce any &s;hips of their own, and the Ru&s;&s;ians the &s;ole navi|gation of the Ca&s;pian Sea. There is not a richer or more profitable trade in the world, than that which is carried on between Gombroon and Surat in the Ea&s;t Indies; and the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-India company frequently let out their &s;hips to tran&s;port the merchandize of the Banians and Armenians from Per&s;ia to India. The civil wars which de|&s;olated this country, and put a &s;top to all trade, after the death of Shah-Nadir, &s;eem to have been over &s;everal years, Kerim khan, one of the com|petitors, having gained &s;uch a &s;uperiority, in the year 1763, over his rivals, that he was crowned king; &s;ince which time peace and tranquillity &s;eem to have taken place of anarchy and confu&s;ion. The &s;hah, or &s;overeign of Per&s;ia, is the chief merchant, and he u&s;ually employs his Armenian &s;ubjects to traffic for him in every part of the world. The king's agent mu&s;t have the refu&s;al of all merchandize, be|fore his &s;ubjects are permitted to trade. It is compu|ted that Per&s;ia produces yearly upwards of twenty-two thou&s;and bales of &s;ilk, chiefly in the provinces of Ghilan and Mazanderan, each bale weighing two hundred and &s;ixty-three pounds. Va&s;t quanti|ties of Per&s;ian &s;ilk u&s;ed to be imported into Eu|rope, e&s;pecially by the Dutch, Engli&s;h, and Ru&s;|&s;ians, before the civil wars began. The goods exported from Per&s;ia to India are, tobacco, all &s;orts of fruits, pickled and pre&s;erved, e&s;pecially dates, marmelade, wines, di&s;tilled waters, hor&s;es, Per&s;ian feathers, and Turky leather of all &s;orts and colours, a great quantity whereof is al&s;o exported to Mu&s;covy and other European countries. The ex|ports
<PB N="272" REF="2730">
to Turky are tobacco, galls, thread, goats hair, &s;tuffs, mats, box-work, and many other things. As there are no po&s;ts in the Ea&s;t, and trading by commi&s;&s;ion, with the u&s;e of bills of exchange, is little known, traffic mu&s;t proceed in a very auk|ward heavy manner, in compari&s;on of that of Europe.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t current money of Per&s;ia are the aba&s;|&s;ees, worth about one &s;hilling and four-pence &s;ter|ling: they are of the fine&s;t &s;ilver. An aba&s;&s;ee is worth two mahmoudes; a mahmoude, two &s;ha|hees; and a &s;hahee, ten &s;ingle or five double ca&s;|beghes: the&s;e la&s;t pieces are of bra&s;s, the others of &s;ilver; for gold is not current in trade. The &s;ha|hees are not very common; but mahmoudes, and ca&s;beghes, are current every where. Hor&s;es, ca|mels, hou&s;es, &amp;c. are generally &s;old by the toman, which is an imaginary coin, worth two hundred &s;ha|hees, or fifty aba&s;&s;ees; and they u&s;ually reckon their e&s;tates that way. Such a one, they &s;ay, is worth &s;o many tomans, as we &s;ay pounds in England.</P>

<HEAD>CONSTITUTION, FORCES, and REVENUE, with the KING'S ARMS and TITLES.</HEAD>
<P>Per&s;ia is an ab&s;olute monarchy, the lives and e&s;tates of the people being entirely at the di&s;po&s;al of their prince. The king has no council e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, but is advi&s;ed by &s;uch mini&s;ters as are mo&s;t in favour; and the re&s;olutions taken among the women of the haram frequently defeat the be&s;t laid de&s;igns. The crown is hereditary, excluding on|ly the females. The &s;ons of a daughter are allow|ed to inherit. The laws of Per&s;ia exclude the blind from the throne; which is the rea&s;on that the reigning prince u&s;ually orders the eyes of all the males of the royal family, of whom he has any jea|lou&s;y, to be put out. The king has generally a
<PB N="273" REF="2740">
great many wives, which it would be death for any one, be&s;ides the eunuchs, who have the &s;uperin|tendance of them, to look at, or even &s;ee by acci|dent; wherefore, when he travels, notice is given to all men to quit the road, nay their very hou&s;es, and to retire to a great di&s;tance.</P>
<P>The prime mini&s;ter is called attemaet doulet, which &s;ignifies the director of the empire, and al&s;o vizir azem, or the great &s;upporter of the empire; as he alone almo&s;t &s;u&s;tains the whole weight of the admini&s;tration. This mini&s;ter's chief &s;tudy is to plea&s;e his ma&s;ter, to &s;ecure to him&s;elf an a&s;cendant over his mind, and to avoid whatever may give him any unea&s;ine&s;s or umbrage. With this view, he never fails to flatter him, to extol him above all the princes upon earth, and to throw a thick veil over every thing that might help to open his eyes, or di&s;cover to him the weakne&s;s of the &s;tate. He even takes particular care to keep the king in utter ignorance, to hide from him, or at lea&s;t to &s;often, all unwelcome news, and, above all, to exalt immode|rately every the lea&s;t advantage he obtains over his enemies. As he takes the&s;e methods, which indeed are and mu&s;t be taken, more or le&s;s, by the mini&s;ters of every de&s;potic prince, to &s;ecure the favour and confidence of his ma&s;ter; &s;o the inferior officers, and governors of provinces, are obliged to employ all the means in their power to &s;ecure the prime mini&s;ters, they depending no le&s;s upon him than he does upon the king. There is a gradation of de&s;poti&s;m and &s;lavery, down from the prime mini&s;ter to the lowe&s;t retainer to the court, or dependent on the govern|ment. The governors of the provinces, &amp;c. &s;pare no pains or money to obtain the royal ve&s;ts, called calaat; as none will dare to complain of their mi&s;|demeanors, when they appear to be &s;o much in fa|vour as to have the&s;e robes &s;ent them, though they are in reality purcha&s;ed. Children are &s;ometimes,
<PB N="274" REF="2750">
in Per&s;ia, required by the king to cut off the ears and no&s;e, and even to cut the throats of their parents; and the&s;e orders cannot be objected to, without endangering their own lives. Indeed, their ba&s;ene&s;s and mercenarine&s;s are &s;uch, that they will perpetrate &s;uch atrocious deeds without the lea&s;t &s;cruple or difficulty, when they have a promi&s;e or expectation of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing their po&s;ts. The prime mini&s;ters, notwith&s;tanding the precarious footing on which they &s;tand, in effect of their abilities or good fortune, &s;ometimes continue in their em|ployments during life, or, if removed, are only bani&s;hed to &s;ome city, where they are allowed to &s;pend the remainder of their days in a private &s;ta|tion.</P>
<P>Next to the prime mini&s;ter are the na-dir, or grand-ma&s;ter of the hou&s;hold; the mehter, or groom of the chambers, who is always a white eu|nuch; the mir-akbor-ba&s;he, or ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e; the mir-&s;hikarba&s;he, or great hunt&s;man and falco|ner; the divan-beggi, or chief ju&s;tice, to whom there lies an appeal from the deroga, or the lieute|nant of police, in every town; the vacka-nuviez, or recorder of events, or fir&s;t &s;ecretary of &s;tate; the mu&s;lau-&s;he-elmenaleck, or ma&s;ter of the accounts and finances of the kingdom; the numes-hum|ba&s;hes, or the king's chief phy&s;icians; the &s;hick|ada-&s;iba&s;he, or in&s;pector of the palace, and regula|tor of rank at court; and the khans, or governors of provinces, under whom are other governors, called &s;oltans, appointed al&s;o by the king.</P>
<P>The chief mini&s;ters, in &s;pirituals, are the zedder, or grand pontiff, an&s;wering to the mufti among the Turks; under him are the &s;heik-el, &s;elom, and cadi, who decide in all matters of religion, and make all contracts, te&s;taments, and other public deeds, being appointed by the king in all the prin|cipal towns; and next to the&s;e are the pichnamas,
<PB N="275" REF="2760">
or directors of the prayers; and the moullahs, or doctors of the law.</P>
<P>There is no nobility in Per&s;ia, or any re&s;pect &s;hewn to a man on account of his family, except to tho&s;e who are of the blood of their great prophet, or patriarchs; but every man is e&s;teemed ac|cording to the po&s;t he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, and when he is di&s;mi&s;&s;ed he lo&s;es his honour, and is no longer di|&s;tingui&s;hed from the vulgar.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the forces of Per&s;ia, their two bodies, called the kort&s;hies and goulans, that &s;erve on hor&s;eback, are well kept and paid, and may amount, the former to about twenty-two thou&s;and, and the latter to about eighteen. The kort&s;hies are de&s;cended from an antient but foreign race; and the goulans are either Georgian renegadoes or &s;laves, or the children of &s;laves of all nations. The infantry, called Tangtchies, are picked out from among the mo&s;t robu&s;t and vigorous of the pea&s;ants, and compo&s;e a body of forty or fifty thou|&s;and. The Per&s;ians have few fortified towns, and had no &s;hips of war till Kouli Khan built a royal navy, and among them had a man of war of eighty guns; but &s;ince the death of that u&s;urper, we hear no more of their fleet.</P>
<P>The arms of the king of Per&s;ia are a lion couch|ant, looking at the &s;un, as he ri&s;es over his back. His u&s;ual title is &s;hah or pat&s;haw, the di&s;po&s;er of kingdoms. They add al&s;o to the king's titles tho&s;e of &s;ultan, and chan or cham, which is the title of the Tartar &s;overeigns. To acts of &s;tate the Per&s;ian monarch does not &s;ub&s;cribe his name; but the grant runs in this manner, viz. this act or edict is given by him whom the univer&s;e obeys.</P>

<HEAD>PERSONS, HABITS, GENIUS, TEMPER, MAN|NERS, and CUSTOMS.</HEAD>
<P>The modern Per&s;ians, like the Turks, plundering all the adjacent nations for beauties to breed by, are men of a good &s;tature, &s;hape, and complexion; but the Gaures or antient Per&s;ians are homely, ill-&s;haped, and clum&s;y, with a rough &s;kin, and olive complec|tions. In &s;ome provinces, as we have already ob|&s;erved, not only the complexions but the con&s;titu|tions of the inhabitants &s;uffer greatly by the ex|treme heat, and unwhole&s;omene&s;s of the air. The Per&s;ian women too are generally hand&s;ome and well-&s;haped, but much inferior to tho&s;e of Georgia and Circa&s;&s;ia. The men wear large turbans on their heads, &s;ome of them very rich, interwoven with gold and &s;ilver; a ve&s;t, girt with a &s;a&s;h; and over it a loo&s;e garment, &s;omething &s;horter; with &s;andals, or &s;lippers, on their feet. When they ride, which they do every day, if it be but to a hou&s;e in the &s;ame town, they wear pliant boots of yellow leather; the furniture of their hor&s;es is extremely rich, and the &s;tirrups generally of &s;ilver; whether on hor&s;eback or on foot, they wear a broad &s;word and dagger in their &s;a&s;h. The dre&s;s of the women does not differ much from that of the men; only their ve&s;ts are longer, and they wear &s;tiffened caps on their heads, and their hair down.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ians have been always e&s;teemed a brave people, of great vivacity and quick parts; but are famed for nothing more than their humanity and ho&s;pitality. Their greate&s;t foibles are profu&s;ene&s;s and vanity; the richne&s;s of their cloaths, and the number of their &s;ervants and equipage, too often exceed their incomes, and bring them into diffi|culties. They have a particular pa&s;&s;ion for hunt|ing, which is commonly managed by birds of prey.
<PB N="277" REF="2780">
There is no place where women are &s;o &s;trictly con|fined as in Per&s;ia, e&s;pecially in the harams of the great men. The Per&s;ians drink coffee for break|fa&s;t; and, at eleven, they dine on melons, fruit, or milk. Their chief meal is in the evening, when they generally have a di&s;h of pilo, con&s;i&s;ting of boiled rice, fowls, or mutton, &s;o overdone that they pull the meat in pieces with their fingers, u&s;ing neither knives, forks, or &s;poons. Pork is never eaten by them, or hares, and other animals prohi|bited to the Jews. Their bread is only cakes, baked on the hearth. They &s;ea&s;on their meat very high, with &s;alt and &s;pices, when they dre&s;s it; but never &s;alt up their meat, eating it the &s;ame day it is killed. They &s;pread a cloth upon the carpet, and &s;it down cro&s;s-legged upon it at their meals, and wipe on their handkerchiefs in&s;tead of towels. The Per&s;ians are a very ho&s;pitable people, inviting &s;trangers, as well as their neighbours, to eat with them, if they happen to be in their hou&s;es at meal|time. At their fe&s;tivals, the company is entertain|ed with mu&s;ic, both vocal and in&s;trumental, and the dancing girls are frequently &s;ent for. If any of the gue&s;ts have a mind to withdraw with one of the&s;e girls, he is &s;hewn into a room, and, when they return no notice is taken of it. Their u&s;ual drink is water and &s;herbet, as in other Mohammedan countries, wine being prohibited; but the officers and &s;oldiers frequently break through the&s;e re|&s;traints, and drink wine, which is made by the Ar|menians and Gaures, in Schiras and other Per&s;ian provinces; and none of them make any &s;cruple of intoxicating them&s;elves with opium, of which any of them will eat as much as would poi&s;on half a dozen Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ians excel more in poetry than any other &s;ort of literature; and a&s;trologers are now in as great reputation in Per&s;ia, as the magi were former|ly.
<PB N="278" REF="2790">
Their books are all manu&s;cripts, the art of printing having not yet been introduced among them; they excel indeed in writing, and have eight different hands. They write from the right hand to the left, as the Arabs do. In their &s;hort hand, they u&s;e the letters of the alphabet; and the &s;ame letters, differently pointed, will have twenty different &s;ignifications. In &s;hort, the Per&s;ians are born with as good natural parts as any people in the Ea&s;t, but make a bad u&s;e of them; being great di&s;&s;emblers, cheats, liars, and flatterers, and having a &s;trong propen&s;ity to voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, lux|ury, idlene&s;s, and indolence; vices, indeed, to which the A&s;iatics, in general, are much addicted.</P>

<HEAD>REVOLUTIONS and MEMORABLE EVENTS.</HEAD>
<P>The Per&s;ian monarchy &s;ucceeded that of the A&s;&s;yrian or Babylonian, which we e&s;teem the &s;ame; only the &s;eat of the empire was fir&s;t at Nineveh, and afterwards at Babylon. Cyrus, making a con|que&s;t of Babylon, united the dominions of Media, Per&s;ia, and Babylon, and laid the foundation of the Per&s;ian empire, about the year of the world 3468, and 556 before Chri&s;t. Alexander the Great, con|quering Darius Codomnanus, the la&s;t emperor of Per|&s;ia, the Grecian monarchy commenced in the year of the world 3675, and before Chri&s;t 329. After the death of Alexander, that empire was divided among his general-officers, of whom Seleucus, Antigonus, and Ptolemy, were the chief; and the po&s;terity of the&s;e princes were &s;ubdued by the Romans, about the year 3956, being about 197 years before Chri&s;t. Upon the decline of that empire, the&s;e dominions were again divided among &s;everal princes; until Ta|merlane, a Mongul Tartar, made a conque&s;t of mo&s;t of the &s;outhern nations of A&s;ia, which he abandoned
<PB N="279" REF="2800">
almo&s;t as &s;oon as he conquered, except India, and &s;ome of the ea&s;tern provinces of Per&s;ia, to which his &s;ons &s;ucceeded; and his po&s;terity &s;till reign in India, being &s;tiled great Moguls from their victo|rious ance&s;tor. Upon the retreat of Tamerlane from Per&s;ia, Cheik Aider, a doctor of the Mo|hammedan law, and a popular preacher, ob|tained the &s;overeignty of the we&s;tern Per&s;ia, pre|tending he was directly de&s;cended from Moham|med, and took upon him the title of caliph, which comprehends the offices both of prie&s;t and king; and was &s;ucceeded by his &s;on Sephi or Sophi, from whom future kings were &s;ometimes called &s;ophis. Shah Abbas, who de&s;cended from Sophi, greatly enlarged the empire: on the &s;ide of India, he con|quered the province of Candahor; on the &s;outh, he reduced Lar and Ormus, and drove the Turks out of Armenia and Georgia: he tran&s;planted the Ar|menians from Julpha to I&s;pahan, and made them his factors and merchants in every part of Europe and A&s;ia. Shah &s;ultan Ho&s;&s;ein, the la&s;t king of this race, &s;ucceeded to the crown in the year 1694, and continued to reign many years after his acce&s;|&s;ion in peace; but the court of Per&s;ia &s;etting every thing to &s;ale in his reign, Mereweis Khan, a popu|lar nobleman, purcha&s;ed the government of Can|dahor; but was &s;oon after di&s;placed, to make room for another nobleman, who offered more money. Mere weis thereupon became a malecontent, a&s;&s;em|bled his friends and dependents, and drove his ri|val out of Candahor; after which &s;ucce&s;s, he be|gan his march towards Spahawn, or I&s;pahan, but died before he arrived there. Mahomood, his &s;on, advanced with the army, and laid &s;iege to the ca|pital, which he took; and &s;oon after put to death the king, and all the royal family, except prince Thamas, who e&s;caped, and fled to the north of Per&s;ia. Not long after, Mahomood was murdered
<PB N="280" REF="2810">
by E&s;riff, one of his officers, who u&s;urped the throne. Upon this prince Thamas, a&s;&s;embling an army, invited Nadir Khan into his &s;ervice, who had obtained great reputation for his valour and con|duct. He was the &s;on of a Per&s;ian nobleman, on the frontiers of U&s;beck Tartary; and his uncle, who was his guardian, keeping him out of po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the ca&s;tle and e&s;tate, which was his inheri|tance, he took to robbing the caravans; and, hav|ing increa&s;ed his followers to upwards of five hun|dred men, became the terror of that part of the country, and e&s;pecially of his uncle, who had &s;eized his e&s;tate. His uncle therefore re&s;olved to make his peace with him, and with that view invited him to the ca&s;tle, where he entertained him in a &s;plendid manner; but Nadir Khan ordered his throat to be cut next night, and all his people to be turned out of the ca&s;tle. No &s;ooner had Nadir Khan got the command of the Per&s;ian army, than he attacked and defeated the u&s;urper E&s;riff, put him to death, and recovered all the places the Turks and Ru&s;&s;ians had made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of during the rebellion; and then prince Thamas &s;eemed to be e&s;tabli&s;hed on the throne: but Nadir Khan, to whom Thamas had given the name of Thamas Kouli-Khan, that is, the Slave of Thamas, thinking his &s;ervices not &s;ufficiently rewarded, and pretending that the king had a de&s;ign again&s;t his life, or at lea&s;t to &s;et him a&s;ide, con&s;pired again&s;t his &s;overeign, and put him to death, as is &s;uppo&s;ed: after which, he u&s;urped the throne, &s;tiling him&s;elf &s;hah Nadir, or king Nadir.</P>
<P>He afterwards laid &s;iege to Candahor, of which a &s;on of Mereweis had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf. While he lay at this &s;iege, the court of the great mogul being di&s;tracted with factions, one of the parties invited &s;hah Nadir to come to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and betrayed the mogul into his hands. He there|upon
<PB N="281" REF="2820">
marched to Delhi, the capital of India, and &s;ummoned all the viceroys and governors of pro|vinces to attend him, and bring with them all the trea&s;ures they could rai&s;e, and tho&s;e that did not bring as much as he expected, he tortured and put to death. Having thus ama&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t trea|&s;ure that ever prince was ma&s;ter of, he returned to Per&s;ia, giving the mogul his liberty, on condition of his re&s;igning the provinces on the we&s;t &s;ide of the Indus to the crown of Per&s;ia. He afterwards made a conque&s;t of U&s;bec Tartary, and plundered Bochara the capital city. Then he marched again&s;t the Dagi&s;tan Tartars, but lo&s;t great part of his army in their mountains, without fighting. He defeated the Turks in &s;everal engagements, but laying &s;iege to Bagdad, was twice compelled to rai&s;e the &s;iege. He proceeded to change the reli|gion of Per&s;ia to that of Omar, hanged up the chief prie&s;ts, put his own &s;on to death, and was guilty of &s;uch cruelty, that he was at length a&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nated by his own relations, anno 1747. A conte&s;t upon this en&s;ued between the&s;e relations for the crown, which continued for &s;everal years, and made Per&s;ia a dreadful &s;cene of confu&s;ion, blood&s;hed, and deva&s;tation; but, at la&s;t, fortune declared in favour of Kerim Khan, who was crown|ed in the month of October, 1763, at Tauris. Thus that va&s;t empire, after having been long plunged in all the horrors of an inte&s;tine war, will gain, at lea&s;t, a little re&s;pite, and be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, for a time, in peace and tranquillity; but that tran|quillity, probably, will depend upon the life of the khan, who, by the la&s;t accounts, was encamped in the neighbourhood of Schiras, with an army of &s;eventy thou&s;and men.</P>

<HEAD>RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>As to the religion of the modern Per&s;ians, they are Mohammedans, of the &s;ect of Ali, whom the Turks call Shiites, a term of reproach, formed from Shi|yah, denoting properly a &s;candalous reprobate &s;ect; but the partizans of Ali &s;tile them&s;elves Adaliyah, which &s;ignifies tho&s;e who adhere to the truth, and take the right &s;ide, and &s;tigma|tize their adver&s;aries with the appellation of Shiites. The Turks call them&s;elvs Sonnites, be|cau&s;e they receive the Sonna, or book of Tradi|tions of their prophet, as of canonical authority: whereas the Per&s;ians reject it as apocryphal, and un|worthy of credit. The Per&s;ians al&s;o reject Abubecr, Omar, and Othman, the three fir&s;t khalifs, as u&s;urpers and intruders; and maintain that Ali Ebn Abu T&acirc;leb was the true khalif and im&acirc;m after Mohammed, and that the &s;upreme authority, both in &s;pirituals and temporals, belongs of right to his de&s;cendants: but the Sonnites acknowlege and re|&s;pect them as rightful im&acirc;ms. The Per&s;ians prefer Ali to Mohammed, or, at lea&s;t, e&s;teem them both equal; but the Sonnites admit neither Ali, nor any of the prophets, to be equal to Mohammed. The Sonnites charge the Shiites with corrupting the Koran, and neglecting its precepts; and the
<PB N="283" REF="2840">
Shiites retort the &s;ame charge upon the Sonnites. To the&s;e di&s;putes, and &s;ome others of le&s;s moment, is principally owing the antipathy which has &s;o long reigned between the Turks and the Per&s;ians. Some authors maintain, that the Shiites are &s;ubdivided into no le&s;s than &s;eventy different &s;ects, all of which hold a metemp&s;ycho&s;is, or tran&s;migration of &s;ouls, and the Al-Hol&ucirc;l, or de&s;cent of God upon his crea|tures, or the tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion of the &s;pirit of &s;anctity from one per&s;on to another. Other tenets held by the Shiites, in oppo&s;ition to the Sonnites, are, that the peculiar de&s;ignation of the im&acirc;m, or high|prie&s;t of I&s;lami&s;m, and the te&s;timonies of the Ko|r&acirc;n and Mohammed concerning him, are nece&s;&s;ary points; that the im&acirc;ms ought nece&s;&s;arily to keep them&s;elves free from light &s;ins, as well as tho&s;e that are more grievous; and, la&s;tly, that every one ought publickly to declare who it is that he ad|heres to, and from whom he &s;eparates him&s;elf, by word, deed, and engagement; and that herein there &s;hould not be the lea&s;t di&s;&s;imulation. In this la&s;t point, however, one &s;ect of the Shiites, called Zeidians, di&s;&s;ents from all the re&s;t. At this day not only the Per&s;ians, but one half of the princes of the U&s;becks, who&s;e dominions lie beyond the Jih&ucirc;n or the Am&ucirc;, the Oxus of the antients, and &s;ome Mohammedan kings of the Indies, are fol|lowers of Ali, and, among&s;t the other Mohamme|dans, go under the afore&s;aid opprobrious deno|mination.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides Mohammedans, there are &s;till remain|ing in the mountains of Per&s;ia, and in &s;ome parts of India, &s;ome of the po&s;terity of the antient Per|&s;ians, called at pre&s;ent Per&s;ees, Gaures, or Gue|bres, who profe&s;s them&s;elves followers of Zer|du&s;ht, or Zoroa&s;ter, according to the tenets con|tained in the book Sad-der, which is a compen|dium of the writings of that philo&s;opher and law|giver.
<PB N="284" REF="2850">
They pay an extraordinary veneration to fire and the &s;un: but are not, we are told, idola|ters, their re&s;pect to fire flowing from their con|&s;idering it as a &s;ymbol of the divinity, and to the &s;un, from their belief that he is the noble&s;t crea|ture of God vi&s;ible to us, and that the throne of the Almighty is placed therein. Whoever de&s;ires to be exactly informed of the precepts, doctrines, ceremonies, and cu&s;toms of the Per&s;ees, may con|&s;ult the learned and judicious Dr. Thomas Hyde's valuable hi&s;tory of the antient religion of the Per|&s;ians, and the book Sad-der, containing a Com|pendium of the writings of Zoroa&s;ter, which is annexed to the doctor's treati&s;e. The&s;e Per&s;ees are a very quiet, hone&s;t, inoffen&s;ive people. Since the introduction of Mohammedi&s;m into Per&s;ia, they have been expo&s;ed to various per&s;ecutions on account of their religion; for the Mohammedans being, generally &s;peaking, bigots, they are not contented with giving the&s;e unhappy men always ill language, but, on every occa&s;ion, are &s;tirring up their princes to oppre&s;s and de&s;troy the&s;e relicts of the antient Per&s;ians. They tells us, that their religion having been much corrupted by the errors and &s;uper&s;titions that had crept into it, Zerdu&s;ht came to re&s;tore their primitive doctrines, and to purge away the errors and abu&s;es, that had been introduced into it. Plutarch &s;ays, "There were &s;ome of the antients who a&s;&s;erted two &s;upreme Beings, the one the author of all good, and the other of all evil; others who admitted but one God, the father of good, but who acknowledged there was a demon, from whom all evil proceeded: this la&s;t, &s;ays he, was the doctrine of Zoroa&s;ter, who flouri&s;hed four thou&s;and years before the Tro|jan war." Antiently the pyrea, or fire temples, were as frequent in Per&s;ia as pari&s;h churches in Chri&s;tian countries, but are now far from being
<PB N="285" REF="2860">
common. The Per&s;ees content them&s;elves with &s;aying their prayers before the common fires, and their prie&s;ts officiate before them likewi&s;e. They have, however, fire temples &s;till in &s;ome places, and the chief of them is &s;aid to be in the province of Kerman, where there are more Ghaurs than in any other part of Per&s;ia. The prie&s;ts, among the antient Per&s;ians, were called magi, and were of three degrees, viz. the ordinary prie&s;ts, the over|&s;eers of the&s;e, and an archimagus, who was ac|knowledged for the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Zoroa&s;ter, and accounted the &s;upreme head of their church. The Per&s;ees pretend, that Abraham was the original author of their religion, and that he re&s;ided &s;ome time in Per&s;ia, but that is not at all probable. Tho' fire was held the &s;ymbol of the Divinity among the Per&s;ians, yet the other elements were al&s;o highly honoured by them, in&s;omuch that the Greeks, and other foreigners, who knew not their religious principles, called them wor&s;hippers of the elements; but all the re&s;pect they paid them aro&s;e from their conceiving them to be the fir&s;t &s;eeds of all things. The eternal omnipotent Being, the Creator and Pre&s;erver of all things, was called by the antient Per&s;ians Yezad, Izad, or Izud, al&s;o Ormuzd, Hormus, or Hormizda; and the evil created Be|ing, Ahariman, Ahreman, or Ahriman, and in ver&s;e Ahrimanan, which &s;ignifies among them the devil. We &s;hall &s;ay nothing farther here of this religion: a minute account of it will be found in the treati&s;e mentioned above, to which we refer the reader.</P>

<HEAD>Of the provinces of Per&s;ia.</HEAD>
<P>Shirwan, of old a part of Media, is the mo&s;t northern province of Per&s;ia, lying along the we&s;tern coa&s;t of the Ca&s;pian Sea, and bounded by a part
<PB N="286" REF="2870">
of Georgia on the north. The river Kur or Cyrus parts it from the province of Erivan; and the Kur and Aras, the Araxes of the antients, &s;eparates it from Aiderbeitzan. It is a cold, but healthy country. The northern parts lying between the Ca&s;pian mountains and the &s;ea, are both cold and barren. The poore&s;t inhabitants make their bread of dried almonds, and their drink of the juice of certain herbs. The &s;now lies on the mountains nine months of the year. The &s;outhern parts are pro|ductive of all &s;orts of grain, and withal extremely plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>The towns of mo&s;t note in it are, Samaki, rec|koned the capital of Shirwan, Derbent and Gan|gea, or Ganja. Samaki &s;tands on a river, which falls into the Ca&s;pian Sea, &s;ixty-&s;ix miles to the &s;outh of Derbent. It is &s;aid to be about a league in circumference, and to contain about &s;ixty thou|&s;and inhabitants. There are many caravan&s;eras, mo&s;ques, and bazars in it; but the hou&s;es are very mean, flat at top, and &s;o low for the mo&s;t part, that one may reach the roofs of them from the ground with their hand. That in which the khan or governor of Shirwan re&s;ides, &s;tands on an emi|nence, but makes no great figure without. Some of the bazars are covered with &s;tone, and others with timber, and contain &s;everal &s;treets, full of &s;hops of gold-&s;miths, &s;adlers, &amp;c. The govern|ment of Samaki, or Shirwan, is one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in Per&s;ia, and its governor a &s;ort of king, having the command of a body of twenty-five hundred hor&s;e, of whom three hundred &s;erve him as guards, and attend him when he appears abroad, or goes a hunting with an ar&s;enal, a chan|cery, and a council. They &s;oon grow rich by the great &s;ub&s;idies they levy upon the province, and the neighbouring countries.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="2880">
Derbent, called by the Per&s;ians Babelabouah, is a large city, on the we&s;tern &s;hore of the Ca&s;pian Sea, about fifteen miles to the &s;outh-ea&s;t of Teflis, the capital of Georgia. It was antiently called Ca&s;piae Pylae, or Portae and Clau&s;tra, from its &s;itu|ation in a defile between the Ca&s;pian and the craggy mountains, on the frontiers of Georgia. The coa&s;t of the Ca&s;pian here is one continued rock, which renders it very dangerous for &s;hipping. The city, being an important pa&s;s between Mu&s;covy and Tartary on the one &s;ide, and Per&s;ia on the other, is well fortified. It hath been in the hands of the Mu&s;covites ever &s;ince the year 1723, when it was taken during Myrr-Weis's rebellion, and, in 1735, yielded to them by the treaty of peace then concluded with &s;hah Nadir.</P>
<P>Gangea, or Ganja, &s;tands in a plea&s;ant plain, on the road between Erivan and Samaki, one hun|dred and eighteen miles to the &s;outh-we&s;t of Der|bent. It is one of the be&s;t and hand&s;ome&s;t towns of Per&s;ia, &s;urrounded with delightful groves and gardens, adorned with &s;tately bazars, and large caravan&s;eras, or inns for travellers, and having a fine river running through it.</P>
<P>Aiderbeitzan, or, as the Per&s;ians call it, Azer|beyan, a part of the antient Media, is bounded on the &s;outh by Per&s;ian Ir&acirc;k, or Ir&acirc;k-Agemi; to the north by Shirwan; to the ea&s;t by Ghilan and Tabri&s;tan; and to the we&s;t and north-we&s;t by Upper-Armenia, or Turcomania. It is thought to have had its Per&s;ian name, which &s;ignifies a country of fire, from being the place where the chief of the antient fire-temples &s;tood. The &s;oil of this province is fruitful, and the air healthy, tho' &s;omewhat cold. The mo&s;t noted towns in it are Tauris and Ardevil. The former is reckoned the &s;econd city in Per&s;ia, and inferior only to I&s;pahan in extent, wealth, trade, dignity, and grandeur.
<PB N="288" REF="2890">
It &s;tands at the foot of a mountain, which modern authors will have to be that called Orontes, or Ba|rontes, by Polybius, Diodorus, and Ptolemy, a|bout one hundred and eighty three miles to the &s;outh-ea&s;t of Erivan, and is watered by two &s;mall rivers, but has no walls nor fortifications, and but few palaces, or magnificent hou&s;es. The bazars, or markets, however, are the mo&s;t beautiful in A&s;ia, being long arched &s;treets, forty or fifty feet high, with ranges of &s;hops on both &s;ides. The other public buildings are no le&s;s &s;umptuous, e&s;pe|cially the caravan&s;eras, of which they reckon no le&s;s than three hundred, &s;ome of them &s;pacious enough to lodge three hundred people. There are three ho&s;pitals, where they give victuals twice a-day to tho&s;e that come, but nobody is lodged in them. Sir John Chardin reckons the number of inhabitants at above five hundred thou&s;and. The principal manufactures are tho&s;e of cotton, &s;ilk, and gold. The trade of the city extends all over Per&s;ia and Turky, and even into Ru&s;&s;ia, Tartary, and India. The air is dry and healthy, but cold, the &s;now lying nine months of the year upon the tops of the mountains, that &s;urround it. The city is well &s;upplied with all &s;orts of provi&s;ions and ne|ce&s;&s;aries, &s;o that a man may live there very delici|ou&s;ly at a cheap rate. From the Ca&s;pian Sea, which is about forty leagues di&s;tant, the inhabitants are furni&s;hed with fi&s;h. The u&s;ual price of bread is three pounds for a penny, and a pound of fle&s;h for three halfpence. In &s;ummer, there is plenty of veni&s;on and wild fowl. Near the city are quarries of white marble, of which one &s;ort is tran&s;parent, &s;everal mineral waters, &s;ome cold and others hot, with a mine of &s;alt, and another of gold, but the la&s;t is not wrought, the produce of it not an&s;wering the expence. This city, in the opinion of &s;everal geographers, antient and modern, is
<PB N="289" REF="2900">
&s;ituated where Ecbatan, the great and celebrated capital of the antient Media &s;tood, in which both the Median and Per&s;ian monarchs generally re&s;ided in &s;ummer; but, if it was, there are now no re|mains of any antient magnificent &s;tructure to &s;up|port that opinion. The governor of Tauris is the fir&s;t in the empire, and captain general, having &s;everal khans under him, with a body of three thou&s;and hor&s;e, and a revenue of thirty thou&s;and tomans, be&s;ides ca&s;ualties. The city has often &s;uffered by earthquakes, and, in 1725, it was taken by the Turks, who made a prodigious &s;laugh|ter among the inhabitants. Sir John Chardin thinks, that the Ny&s;ean plain, &s;o famous antiently for the hor&s;es of that name, and the Hippobaton, where the kings of Media had a &s;tud of fifty thou|&s;and hor&s;es, were not far from this city, where he &s;ays, the plains are mo&s;t beautiful, and yield the fine&s;t pa&s;ture of all Media, or, perhaps, of the whole world.</P>
<P>Ardebil, or Ardevil, is about twenty-eight leagues from Tauris to the ea&s;t. It is a large city, but, being &s;urrounded with mountains, and the air continually changing from hot to cold, is &s;ubject to epidemical di&s;ea&s;es. The fir&s;t king of the race of the Sophis lies buried here. The town was for|merly famous for gold &s;tuffs and jewels, but has now lo&s;t its reputation that way. Here, as in mo&s;t other ea&s;tern cities, are many bagnios, or public baths, caravan&s;eras, and bazars, with mo&s;ques not a few. It is watered by a &s;mall river, which Ole|arius calls Balachlu. The meidan, or great &s;quare, is three hundred paces long, and one hundred and fifty broad, with &s;hops all round. Schiek Eidar, the author of the Shai &s;ect, and to whom the So|phian family owed their origin, is buried here un|der a magnificent &s;epulchre, which is vi&s;ited with great devotion by pilgrims. Near it is that called

the Kitchen of Sephi, where, in the time of Olea|rius, one thou&s;and poor at lea&s;t were fed three times a day, Sephi, and &s;everal of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, having endowed it with a large revenue for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The other towns of this province of any note are Miana, Zenjan, or Zengan, and Sultanaya. Some will have the la&s;t to be built where the an|tient Tigranocerta &s;tood. It was once the metro|polis of the kingdom, and there are few cities in the world where there are &s;uch ruins to be &s;een. The evenings, nights, and mornings here are cold, but the day generally very hot.</P>
<P>The province of Ghilan, or Keilan, a part of the antient Hyrcania, is bounded on the ea&s;t by the Ca&s;pian Sea and Tabri&s;tan; on the we&s;t by Aider|beitzan; on the &s;outh by Per&s;ian Ir&acirc;k; and, on the north, by the heath of Mockan, which is the we&s;tern part of Aiderbeitzan. On all &s;ides, ex|cept where it terminates on the Ca&s;pian, it is en|vironed with high mountains, the declivities of which towards Ghilan are covered with lemon, orange, olive, fig, and many other &s;orts of fruit|trees. Game al&s;o in great plenty and variety, with bears, wolves, leopards, and tygers, are bred in the&s;e mountains. In the travels of the duke of Hol|&s;tein's amba&s;&s;adors is the following pa&s;&s;age: "It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed by all tho&s;e who have travelled in tho&s;e parts, that the province of Ghilan is a ter|re&s;trial paradi&s;e, abounding in &s;ilk, oil, wine, rice, tobacco, lemons, oranges, pomegranates, and all other &s;orts of fruits. The vines are very large, having trunks as thick as an ordinary man's wai&s;t. The Ca&s;pian Sea, as well as the rivers belonging to the province, afford the inhabitants prodigious quantities of fi&s;h, as their pa&s;ture grounds furni&s;h them with great &s;tore of cattle, and their fore&s;ts with veni&s;on and wild fowl." In the&s;e travels the air is al&s;o extolled as the mo&s;t temperate and benign
<PB N="291" REF="2920">
in Per&s;ia, which is indeed the ca&s;e at the time the amba&s;&s;adors pa&s;&s;ed through it, which was in winter, no country in the world being more plea|&s;ant and healthy than this from October to May; but, in &s;ummer, the air is &s;o exceeding hot and un|whole&s;ome, that the inhabitants abandon their hou&s;es, and retire to the mountains, twenty-five or thirty leagues from the &s;ea. The privilege of fi&s;hing on the Ca&s;pian is farmed out in this and other provinces bordering on it, and brings in a con&s;iderable revenue.</P>
<P>The chief cities in Ghilan are Re&s;ht, or Ra&s;cht, Ke&s;ker, and A&s;tara. The fir&s;t, &s;tanding about two leagues from the Ca&s;pian Sea, is large and popu|lous, and wants for nothing that can render a city rich, plea&s;ant, and beautiful.</P>
<P>The province of Tabri&s;tan, or Mazanderan, has the Ca&s;pian Sea on the north; Per&s;ian Ir&acirc;k on the &s;outh; Ghilan on the we&s;t; and Chora&s;an on the ea&s;t. This province, including under it Lahe&s;tan and A&s;trabad, or E&s;tarabad, is begirt with high mountains, and watered with plea&s;ant rivers, among the re&s;t by the noble river Oxus, &s;o famous in Greek and Latin authors. It is likewi&s;e celebrated for its fertility, e&s;pecially in vines of &s;uch extraordinary &s;ize, that &s;ome of the clu&s;ters are &s;aid to be two cubits long: the air, however, is &s;o malignant in &s;ummer, that the inhabitants look all of a faint yellow, having neither &s;trength, nor &s;pirits. The cau&s;e of the bad air is the va&s;t number of &s;erpents, and other in&s;ects, which in the &s;ummer-time dying for want of water, as mo&s;t of the &s;prings are then dried up by the violent heat, infect the atmo&s;phere with their &s;tench and corruption.</P>
<P>The places of note in Tabri&s;tan are, Ferh-abad, Mazanderan, which gives names to the province; E&s;criff, Chocoporo, Amoul. The fir&s;t is a fine city and port, &s;ituated on a navigable arm of the

Ca&s;pian Sea, and much frequented by the Ru&s;&s;ian merchants, as being not above a fortnight's &s;ail from A&s;tracan. It is al&s;o remarkable for a palace, which was the ordinary re&s;idence of &s;hah Abas the Great.</P>
<P>E&s;criff is a good city, having about two thou|&s;and hou&s;es, &s;eated near the &s;ea-coa&s;t, and contain|ing al&s;o a palace of &s;hah Abas.</P>
<P>Amol is a large town of about three hundred hou&s;es, &s;eated within land near the mountains. It has a &s;trong ca&s;tle moated round.</P>
<P>The mountains that lie to the &s;outh of the la&s;t two provinces are a branch of Mount Taurus, the pa&s;&s;age through which, in the road to I&s;pahan, is very &s;teep and narrow.</P>
<P>The province now called Per&s;ian Ir&acirc;k, Er&acirc;k, or Ar&acirc;k, or Ir&acirc;k Agemi, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from Chal|dea, called Ir&acirc;k Arabi, and antiently Parthia, is bounded to the ea&s;t by Chora&s;an and Sagi&s;tan; to the we&s;t by Curdi&s;tan; to the &s;outh by Far&s;i&s;tan; to the &s;outh-we&s;t by Chu&s;i&s;tan; to the north by Ghilan and Tabri&s;tan; and to the north-we&s;t by Aiderbeitzan. The air is very dry, but generally the mo&s;t healthful of any in Per&s;ia. A great part of the province con&s;i&s;ts of barren naked mountains, but the plains are fertile and plea&s;ant, e&s;pecially where they can be watered. Though the large&s;t province in Per&s;ia, it has no governor, as mo&s;t of the other provinces have, being entirely the king's proper deme&s;ne. The number of cities are &s;aid to be upwards of forty, be&s;ides a prodigious num|ber of villages. Though, in latter ages, Parthia became the mi&s;tre&s;s of her neighbours, and &s;hared with Rome the empire of the world; yet under the antient Per&s;ian, and even Macedonian mo|narchs, it made no figure. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable cities and towns are,</P>

Ca&s;bin, a large city, &s;eated in a delightful plain, and containing about one hundred thou&s;and inha|bitants. Here is a fine &s;quare, after the model of that at I&s;pahan, called by the Per&s;ians meidan|&s;hah, or the royal piazza; a royal palace with fine gardens; a great many large caravan&s;eras, e&s;pe|cially that called the royal, which has a fine foun|tain in the middle of the court, planted round with trees; &s;everal mo&s;ques, of which that called the royal is one of the large&s;t and faire&s;t in all Per&s;ia; and a va&s;t number of palaces belonging to the Per|&s;ian grandees. The air of Ca&s;bin is heavy, thick, and unwhole&s;ome, e&s;pecially in &s;ummer, owing partly to the want of running water to carry off the filth of the city, but more to the exce&s;&s;ive heat at that &s;ea&s;on in the day time, and the cold in the night. The adjacent country, however, is very fertile in corn, fruit, and cattle, yielding grapes, one &s;pecies in particular of a gold colour, and tran&s;|parent, about the &s;ize of a &s;mall olive. There is al&s;o great plenty of pi&s;tachoes in the&s;e parts. The fa|mous Lockman, &s;o highly e&s;teemed for the fables he compo&s;ed, was a native of this city.</P>
<P>About eighty-eight miles from Ca&s;bin lies the city of Sawa, which is about two miles in circuit, but old, decayed, and thinly peopled. The air there is very hot and unhealthy. About four leagues to the ea&s;t of the city is a mo&s;t &s;umptuous mau&s;oleum, with a magnificent mo&s;que over it; where, they pretend, the prophet Samuel was in|terred. The re&s;ort of pilgrims from all parts of Per&s;ia to this tomb is very great. Nine miles to the we&s;tward are &s;till to be &s;een &s;ome remains of the city of Rey, or Raya, which, according to the Per&s;ian hi&s;tories, in the ninth century, was the large&s;t in all A&s;ia.

This city at pre&s;ent is ju&s;tly celebrated for its manufactures of &s;ilk, called in the Turki&s;h and Per&s;ian languages ko|ma&s;h, in the &s;ame manner as velvet is denominated in the Ea&s;t Katifah, from the town of Katif, &s;itu|ated in the province of Bahrein, on the Per&s;ian Gulph, about two days journey from Ah&s;a, where it is made. They export from this city great quan|tities of fruit, dried and raw, e&s;pecially pome|granates, together with &s;oap, &s;word-blades, and earthen-ware, both white and varni&s;hed. Of the mo&s;ques here, that wherein Fatima, the daughter of Mohammed, is interred, under a mo&s;t magni|ficent mau&s;oleum, is by far the grande&s;t.

<P>About ninety miles from Komm, to the north|we&s;t, &s;tands Hamadan, a very large city, enjoy|ing a very whole&s;ome air, abounding with gardens and fountains, and &s;urrounded with fruitful plains. There is a very high and famous mountain in its neighbourhood, to which the kings, or &s;hahs of Per&s;ia, u&s;ed formerly to retire during the &s;ummer|heats, on account of its delightful &s;ituation, and coll refre&s;hing breezes. Golius &s;eems inclined to think, that it was the Ecbatana of the antients. The inhabitants follow the deci&s;ions of the Sonna, and con&s;equently pay tribute to the kings of Per&s;ia for the free exerci&s;e of their religion. We are told by an Oriental writer, that Hamadan was for|merly four para&s;angs in length, and as many in breadth. The &s;ame author &s;ays it has produced a great many excellent men. The inten&s;e cold in
<PB N="295" REF="2960">
the winter has been taken notice of by &s;everal au|thors. The city is noted for the herds of cattle fed in its neighbourhood, producing va&s;t quanti|ties of butter, chee&s;e, and hides. Great numbers of Jews flock hither to vi&s;it the pretended tombs of E&s;ther and Mordecai, which are to be &s;een in a lit|tle chapel belonging to that people.</P>
<P>About forty miles from Komm, to the &s;outh, lies Ca&s;han, which, with its &s;uburbs, makes a con&s;iderable city. The private hou&s;es are mean; but the bazars, baths, mo&s;ques, and caravan&s;eras are hand&s;ome &s;tructures. Of the la&s;t, that called the royal, built by &s;hah Abas the Great, without the city, is the faire&s;t, not only in Ca&s;han, but in all Per&s;ia. It has a beautiful fountain in the middle, with large &s;tables in the back part of it, places for &s;ervants and luggage, and all other con|veniences for lodging travellers and merchandize. There is not any place in Per&s;ia where they make more &s;attin, velvet, tabby, plain ti&s;&s;ue, and flower|ed &s;ilks, or &s;ilks mixed with gold and &s;ilver, than in this city, and the adjacent country. In a borough near, called Aron, are two thou&s;and hou&s;es of &s;ilk weavers, and &s;ix hundred gardens. The air here is extremely hot in &s;ummer; and the &s;ting of the &s;corpions, with which the country is infe&s;ted, is then very dangerous.</P>
<P>I&s;pahan, or, as the Per&s;ians pronounce it, Spau|hawn, the capital of Per&s;ia, is &s;ituated in this province, three hundred and &s;ixty miles from Bagdad, upon the ruins, as generally &s;uppo&s;ed, of the antient Hecatompylos, or, as others think, of the A&s;pa of Ptolemy. Mo&s;t of the Ea&s;tern a&s;tronomers and geographers place it in latitude 32&deg;. 25&prime;. north, and longitude 86&deg;. 40&prime;. It &s;tands in a very exten&s;ive plain, &s;urrounded by mountains, and has eight di&s;tricts belonging to it, that contain about four hundred towns and villages. The fer|tility
<PB N="296" REF="2970">
of the &s;oil, the mildne&s;s of the &s;ea&s;ons, and the fine temperature of the air, all con&s;pire to render I&s;pahan one of the mo&s;t charming and delightful cities in the world. It is unanimou&s;ly acknow|ledged, that the pre&s;ent city is of no great antiqui|ty; and the two parts into which it is divided, pre&s;erve the names of two contiguous towns, from the junction of which it was formed. The inhabi|tants of the&s;e, notwith&s;tanding their neighbour|hood, bear an inveterate antipathy to each other, which they di&s;cover on all public occa&s;ions Spau|hawn owes the glory it now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es to the great &s;hah Abas, who, after the conque&s;t of the king|doms of Lar and Ormus, charmed with the &s;itua|tion of this place, made it the capital of his em|pire, between the years 1620 and 1628. The mountains, with which this city is &s;urrounded, de|fend it alike from the &s;ultry heats of &s;ummer, and the piercing winds of the winter &s;ea&s;on; and the plain, on which it &s;tands, is watered by &s;everal ri|vers, which contribute alike to its ornament and u&s;e. Of the&s;e rivers, the Zenderoud, after being joined by the Mahmood, pa&s;&s;es by Spauhawn, where it has three fine bridges over it, and is as broad as the Seine at Paris. The waters of the&s;e united &s;treams are &s;weet, plea&s;ant, and whole&s;ome, almo&s;t beyond compari&s;on; as, indeed, are all the &s;prings, found in the gardens belonging to the hou&s;es of Spauhawn. The extent of Spauhawn is very great, not le&s;s, perhaps, than twenty miles within the walls, which are of earth, poorly built, and &s;o covered with hou&s;es, and &s;haded with gar|dens, that in many places it is difficult to di&s;cover them. The Per&s;ians are wont to &s;ay, <HI>Spauhawn ni&s;pi gehon,</HI> i. e. Spauhawn is half the world. Sir John Chardin &s;ays, that though &s;ome reckoned eleven millions of inhabitants in it, he did not him|&s;elf look upon it as more populous than London.
<PB N="297" REF="2980">
At a di&s;tance, the city is not ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed; for many of the &s;treets being adorned with plan|tanes, and every hou&s;e having its garden, the whole looks like a wood. The &s;treets in general are neither broad nor convenient, there being three great evils which attend them; the fir&s;t is, that being built on common &s;ewers, the&s;e are frequently broke up, which is very dangerous, con&s;idering that mo&s;t people are on hor&s;eback; the &s;econd is, that there are many wells or pits in them, which are not le&s;s dangerous; the third ari&s;es from the people's emp|tying all their ordure from the tops of their hou&s;es: this la&s;t, indeed, is in &s;ome mea&s;ure qualified by the dryne&s;s of the air, and by its being quickly re|moved by the pea&s;ants, who carry it away to dung their grounds. Some reckon eight, and others ten gates, be&s;ides po&s;terns; but all agree that there is no difficulty of entering, at any hour of the day or night. The three principal &s;uburbs annexed to it are, Abbas-abad, built by &s;hah Abas, and be|longing to the people of Tauris; Julfa, inhabited by a colony of Armenians, called by &s;ome New Julfa, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the antient city of that name, &s;ituated in Armenia, upon the Araxes, whence the original inhabitants of New Julfa were brought; and Ghebr-Ab&acirc;d, or, as the Arabs pro|nounce it, Kebr-Ab&acirc;d, the &s;treet of the magians, occupied entirely by the profe&s;&s;ors of magi&s;m, or the religion of the antient Per&s;ians. The river Zenderoud &s;eparates the city of I&s;pahan and Abas-Abad, from Julfa and Ghebr-Abad. This city has &s;uffered greatly &s;ince the commencement of the dreadful rebellion in 1721; the whole king|dom from that period, till a few years ago, having been almo&s;t a continued &s;cene of blood, ravages, and confu&s;ion. A celebrated modern traveller, who was on the &s;pot, tells us, that the inhabitants of Julfa, not many years before the above revolu|tion
<PB N="298" REF="2990">
happened, amounted to thirty thou&s;and &s;ouls, had thirteen churches, and above an hundred prie&s;ts, and paid the Per&s;ian court two hundred to|mans yearly for the free exerci&s;e of their religion; that &s;ome of the &s;treets were broad and hand&s;ome, and planted with trees, with canals and fountains in the middle, others narrow and crooked, and arched a-top, others again though extremely narrow, as well as turning and winding many ways, were of an incredible length, and re&s;embled &s;o many la|byrinths; that, at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the town, there were public walks, adorned with rows of plane-trees on each &s;ide, ways paved with &s;tone, fountains, and ci&s;terns; that there were above an hundred caravan&s;eras, for the u&s;e of merchants and travellers, many of which were built by the kings and prime nobility of Per&s;ia; that, as little rain fell there, the &s;treets were frequently full of du&s;t, which rendered the city di&s;agreeable during a con&s;iderable part of the &s;ummer; that the citizens, however, to make this inconvenience more tolerable, u&s;ed to water them when the weather was warmer than u&s;ual; that there was a ca&s;tle in the ea&s;tern part of the town, which the citizens looked upon as impregnable, in which the public money, and mo&s;t of the military &s;tores, were &s;aid to be kept; that, notwith&s;tanding the baths and caravan&s;eras were almo&s;t innumerable, there was not one public ho&s;|pital; that mo&s;t of the public buildings were rather neat than magnificent, though the great meydan or market-place, the royal palace, (which is three quarters of a league in circumference) and the al|ley denominated Toher-bag, adjoining to it, made a very grand appearance; that the former contained the royal mo&s;que, the building denominated kay&s;e|rich, where all &s;orts of foreign commodities were expo&s;ed to &s;ale, and the mint, &s;tiled by the Per&s;ians &s;erraah khoneh, where the current money of the
<PB N="299" REF="3000">
kingdom was coined; that, be&s;ides the native Per|&s;ians, there were then in I&s;pahan above ten thou|&s;and Indians, all &s;upported by trade, twenty thou|&s;and Georgians, Circa&s;&s;ians or Chirka&s;&s;ians, and Tartars of Daghe&s;tan or Le&s;gees, with a con&s;ide|rable number of Engli&s;h, Dutch, and Portugue&s;e, and a few French; that the Capuchins, di&s;calciated or bare-footed Carmelites, Je&s;uits, Dominicans, and Au&s;tin friars, had likewi&s;e their convents here, though they were unable to make any converts; and that there were above an hundred mo&s;ques and public colleges. But &s;ince the fatal period above|mentioned, the &s;uburb of Julfa was almo&s;t totally abandoned by the Armenians. The government of I&s;pahan, twenty-three leagues long and as many broad, comprehending &s;everal di&s;tricts, mo&s;t of them well peopled, appeared, not many years ago, little better than a de&s;ert; mo&s;t of the inhabitants of that fertile and delightful tract being fled or di&s;per&s;ed. Multitudes of them had taken a preca|rious refuge in the mountains of Lori&s;t&acirc;n, lying between I&s;pahan and Su&s;ter, who&s;e lands were left untilled, and their hou&s;es mouldered into ruins. In &s;hort, all the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of an un&s;ucce&s;sful war, or the inva&s;ion of a barbarous enemy, could not have plunged the people of I&s;pahan into greater mi&s;ery than the victories of their tyrannical king, Nadir Shah, who &s;eemed more &s;olicitous to humble his own &s;ubjects than his enemies. As this was the ca&s;e before the death of that u&s;urper, in what con|dition mu&s;t we &s;uppo&s;e I&s;pahan, and the re&s;t of Per|&s;ia, to be in now, as the kingdom hath been ever &s;ince, till very lately, de&s;olated by a civil war, oc|ca&s;ioned by &s;everal competitors for the crown? Whoever de&s;ires to be more fully informed in rela|tion to the &s;tate of the city, before the troubles, may con&s;ult Sir John Chardin, Mr. Tavernier, M.

<P>Ye&s;d is a large city, an hundred and &s;eventy-five miles to the ea&s;t of I&s;pahan. The women of Ye&s;d are reckoned the hand&s;ome&s;t in all Per&s;ia.</P>
<P>The province of Khu&s;e&s;tan or Chu&s;i&s;tan, is pret|ty large, bounded on the north by Per&s;ian Ir&acirc;k; on the &s;outh by the Per&s;ian Gulph; on the we&s;t by Ir&acirc;k Arabi; on the &s;outh-we&s;t by the Tigris and Eu|phrates, a little before and after their junction; and on the ea&s;t by Far&s;i&s;tan. It was antiently called Su&s;iana; and is believed by &s;ome to have been the land of Havilah, mentioned in &s;cripture, in the de|&s;cription of the terre&s;trial paradi&s;e. La Martiniere ob&s;erves, that it is the &s;ame country with Cu&s;h, in A&s;&s;yria, having pre&s;erved its antient name, with only a Per&s;ian termination; Chu&s;i&s;tan &s;ignifying the country of Cus or Cu&s;h, as Indo&s;tan does that of the Indus. The chief towns in it are Tu&s;ter, antiently the famous city of Su&s;a, the Shu&s;han of the Scriptures; Ahawas; Scabar; and Ramhor|mus.</P>
<P>Tu&s;ter, or, as &s;ome write it, Shu&s;ter, &s;tands an hundred and twenty-two miles from I&s;pahan, to the &s;outh-we&s;t. It is very plea&s;antly &s;ituated at the conflux of the Choa&s;pes and Eulaeus, now called Tirtiri, and Zaymare. This city was antiently the winter re&s;idence of the Per&s;ian monarchs, as Ec|batan was their &s;ummer &s;eat. Here were pre|&s;erved the records of the empire, and here its trea|&s;ures were laid up. Alexander the Great took from hence nine thou&s;and talents of coined gold, and forty thou&s;and talents of gold and &s;ilver bul|lion.</P>
<P>Ahawas is a large city, &s;ixty-eight miles from Tu&s;ter, towards the we&s;t.</P>
<P>The province of Far&s;i&s;tan, or, as it is &s;ometimes called, Fars or Phars, being the antient Per&s;is, in|cluding
<PB N="301" REF="3020">
Laure&s;tan and the i&s;le of Ormus, is bound|ed on the north by Per&s;ian Ir&acirc;k; on the &s;outh by part of the Per&s;ian Gulph; on the ea&s;t by Kore&s;|tan, and part of Sige&s;tan; and on the we&s;t by Chu|&s;e&s;tan, and part of the Per&s;ian Gulph. The di&s;tricts of this province that lie towards the north are hilly and barren, yielding neither fruit nor corn &s;ufficient for the u&s;e of the inhabitants; &s;ome emeralds, in|deed, are found there, but of no great value. On the coa&s;t of the Per&s;ian Gulph the &s;oil is as bad, though of a different nature, being hot and &s;andy, and producing few other trees than palms; but, between the&s;e, there lies a rich and plea&s;ant region, abounding with corn, fruit, and cattle, and better watered, though but by &s;mall rivers, than mo&s;t of the other tracts within this wide empire. The entrance of this country is very narrow and diffi|cult. The principal towns in it are Schiras, Bena|ron, Lar, Bendar-Aba&s;&s;i or Gombroon, and Ben|der-Congo.</P>
<P>Schiras, with the adjacent country, is thus de|&s;cribed by a famous traveller, in his account of the road from Spauhawn to the Indies: "The city of Schiras, which &s;ome will have to be the antient Per|&s;epolis, the capital of Per&s;ia, lies in 78&deg;. 15&prime;. lon|gitude, and 29&deg;. 36&prime;. latitude. It is &s;eated in a large plain, on a little river called Bendemir, and near a large lake of &s;alt water, about four leagues in compa&s;s. The &s;oil about it is very good and fruitful, and famous for the be&s;t wines in Per&s;ia. The city it&s;elf has nothing hand&s;ome in it; for it looks more like a ruined town than a city. The hou&s;es are built of earth dried in the &s;un, and whitened over with lime; &s;o that when they are well moi&s;tened with rain, they often fall down of them&s;elves. On the north ea&s;t &s;tands an high mountain, which is covered with &s;everal &s;orts of fruit trees, among which are oranges, le|mons,
<PB N="302" REF="3030">
and cypre&s;&s;es; and of the la&s;t there are al&s;o great numbers in the city gardens. There are many fair covered bazars, with large &s;hops, well furni&s;hed with all &s;orts of Indian and Turki&s;h com|modities; and every commodity has its particular bazar. In the college are profe&s;&s;ors, who have &s;a|laries for teaching theology, philo&s;ophy, and medi|cine; and, it is &s;aid, there are &s;ometimes five hun|dred &s;tudents. There are in this city three or four gla&s;s-hou&s;es, where they make great and &s;mall bottles, to tran&s;port the &s;weet waters made in this city; as al&s;o &s;everal other ve&s;&s;els, to put their pickled fruits in, which they &s;end in great quanti|ties into India, Sumatra, Batavia, and other places. Their gla&s;s is made of a white &s;tone, almo&s;t as hard as marble. Some of their bottles are a finger thick, and hold thirty quarts of wine. They have no manufactures at Schiras, but a few coar&s;e paint|ed cloths. The king's garden is well planted with fruit trees, ro&s;es, and je&s;&s;amines; but much neg|lected. It never rains in Schiras but in &s;pring and autumn. There are &s;ome large vineyards, but they dry and pickle a good part of the grapes. The wine is an excellent &s;tomachick, but very &s;trong; &s;o that, without &s;poiling the ta&s;te of it, it will bear two-thirds of water. It is &s;old by weight, and not by mea&s;ure; and a great deal of it is &s;ent yearly to Spauhawn, and the Indies. The people of Schi|ras are very witty; and mo&s;t of the be&s;t poets in Per&s;ia are born here. Such is the plenty of ro&s;es, that they furni&s;h all the Indies with ro&s;e-water. The neighbourhood al&s;o abounds in corn, capers, and white poppies; from the la&s;t of which opium is extracted. About thirty-five miles north-ea&s;t are to be &s;een the ruins of Per&s;epolis, the antient capi|tal of this province, and of the old Per&s;ian empire; which, at the time it was &s;ubdued by Alexander, according to Diodorus Siculus, was the riche&s;t city
<PB N="303" REF="3040">
in the world. The &s;ame author tells us, that the trea&s;ures found in the citadel amounted to an hun|dred and twenty thou&s;and talents of gold. Of the remains and ruins of this antient &s;tately city, a de|&s;cription will be found in Sir Thomas Herbert's, Gemelli's, and Carreri's travels; to which we mu&s;t refer the reader. Thevenot &s;ays, a large town is built about the place where the old city &s;tood, called Mirkas-Chan.</P>
<P>Of the other towns, Lar and Gombroon are the mo&s;t con&s;iderable. The fir&s;t is the capital of a province, called Laure&s;tan, and &s;tands forty-eight miles from the Per&s;ian Gulph, towards the &s;outh. The city is built on a rock, and has no|thing remarkable in it but the khan's hou&s;e, the bazars, and the ca&s;tle. It contains about four thou&s;and hou&s;es, and has a manufacture of &s;ilks, and mu&s;ket-barrels. In the &s;uburbs is the Dutch Ea&s;t-India hou&s;e. Laure&s;tan was once a kingdom, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Gaures.</P>
<P>Gombroon, or, as the natives call it, Bander-Aba&s;&s;i, &s;tands about &s;eventy-two miles to the &s;outh-ea&s;t of Lar, on the coa&s;t of Far&s;i&s;tan, ju&s;t oppo&s;ite the i&s;land of Ormus, in the latitude of 27&deg;. 40&prime;. north. The name of Gombroon, or Comerong, Captain Hamilton tells us, it had from the Portu|gue&s;e; becau&s;e it was remarkable for the number of prawns and &s;hrimps caught on its coa&s;ts, by them called comerong. This city owes its wealth and grandeur to the demolition of Ormus, and the down|fal of the Portugue&s;e empire in the Ea&s;t-Indies. It is now ju&s;tly accounted one of the greate&s;t marts in the Ea&s;t, was built by the great &s;hah Abas, and from him, as &s;ome think, obtained the name of Bander-Aba&s;&s;i, which &s;ignifies the court of A|bas. It &s;tands on a bay about nine leagues to the northward of the ea&s;t end of the i&s;land of Ki&s;hmi&s;h,
<PB N="304" REF="3050">
and three leagues from the famous Ormus. The Engli&s;h began to &s;ettle here about the year 1631, when, in con&s;ideration of their &s;ervices again&s;t the Portugue&s;e, &s;hah Abas granted them half the cu&s;toms of that port. This was confirmed by a phirmaund, and duly regarded, till the Engli&s;h be|gan to neglect the &s;ervices they had &s;tipulated. Whether the company has any emolument from the cu&s;toms, at pre&s;ent, is what we cannot pretend to a&s;certain. The town is large, but its &s;ituation bad; wanting almo&s;t every thing that contributes to the happine&s;s, and even &s;upport of life. Towards the land it is encompa&s;&s;ed by a &s;ort of wall, and towards the &s;ea are &s;everal &s;mall forts, with a platform, and a ca&s;tle or citadel, mounted with cannon, to &s;ecure it and the road from the attempts of an enemy by &s;ea. The hou&s;es in mo&s;t of the &s;treets are &s;o out of repair, &s;ome half down, others in a heap of rubbi&s;h, that a &s;tranger would imagine the town had been &s;acked and ravaged by a barbarous people; not a ve&s;tige of the wealth really contained in the place ap|pearing in view. The bazars and &s;hops round them, are kept, for the mo&s;t part, by Banians, who&s;e hou&s;es are generally in good order. Mo&s;t of the hou&s;es are built with earth and lime, but &s;ome of the be&s;t with &s;tone. Many of them have a &s;ort of ventilators at top, which contribute greatly to the health of the inhabitants in the hot &s;ea&s;ons of the year. The mo&s;t &s;ickly months here are April, May, September, and October. With fi&s;h and mut|ton the inhabitants are well &s;upplied. Rice is im|ported from India, and wheat is &s;o plenty, that the poor &s;ub&s;i&s;t chiefly on bread and dates: as for pilloe, it is a di&s;h fa&s;hionable only among the bet|ter &s;ort. The country hereabouts abounds in the mo&s;t delicious fruits, as apricots, peaches, pome|granates, pears, mangoes, grapes, quavas, plumbs, &s;weet quinces, and water melons. The apricots,
<PB N="305" REF="3060">
however, are &s;mall, and extremely dangerous, if eaten to exce&s;s. The dates, which are very plen|tiful here, and in Arabia, grow on a tree much re&s;embling the cocoa nut tree, only the branches are &s;horter. The fruit hangs on &s;mall twigs, thick about the top of the tree under the boughs, and, when ripe, is e&s;teemed a delicious and whole&s;ome diet. It is deemed fit for u&s;e when it begins to melt on the tree; but the dates intended for &s;ale are plucked &s;ooner, and laid wet in a heap, after|wards packed in bales of a hundred pounds weight, their own juice candying and pre&s;erving them.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e conveniences are more than overbalanced by the &s;carcity of fre&s;h water, with which the in|habitants are &s;upplied from A&s;&s;een, a place &s;even miles di&s;tant, there not being a &s;pring or well in the town. Per&s;ons of condition keep a camel con|&s;tantly employed in bringing fre&s;h and whole&s;ome water. Captain Hamilton gives it as his opinion, that one cau&s;e of the unwhole&s;omene&s;s of this city is the reflexion of the rays of light from a high mountain to the north of it. He &s;ays, that when the beams are reflected from this mountain, they almo&s;t fire the air, and, for two or three months in the year, render the &s;ituation intolerable. For this rea&s;on the people of condition retire into the coun|try, to pa&s;s the heats of June, July, and Augu&s;t. The very &s;ea, during this &s;ea&s;on, is affected, in&s;o|much that the &s;tench is no le&s;s di&s;agreeable than that of putrid carca&s;es; and this is encrea&s;ed by the quantities of &s;hell-fi&s;h left on the &s;hore, from which an exhalation ari&s;es that tarni&s;hes gold and &s;ilver, and is le&s;s tolerable than the bilge-water of a tight &s;hip. At A&s;&s;een the Engli&s;h factory have a country-hou&s;e and gardens, to which they retire occa&s;ionally. Here they have whole groves of Seville orange trees, which, though not natural to the country, thrive very well, and are always ver|dant,
<PB N="306" REF="3070">
bearing ripe and green fruit, with blo&s;&s;oms, all at the &s;ame time. They have likewi&s;e tanks and ponds of fine fre&s;h water, with every thing el&s;e that can moderate the heat of the climate, and render life agreeable and elegant.</P>
<P>About ten miles from A&s;&s;een is a place called Minoa, where are cold and hot natural baths, reckoned infallible in the cure of all &s;crophulous di&s;orders, rheumati&s;ms, and other di&s;ea&s;es, by bathing.</P>
<P>Gombroon is extremely populous, on account of the commerce carried on by the Dutch and Eng|li&s;h factories, as well as the natives. The Eng|li&s;h factory is clo&s;e by the &s;ea, at &s;ome di&s;tance from the Dutch, which is a commodious and fine new building. A great part of the company's pro|fit ari&s;es from freights. As the natives have not one good &s;hip of their own, and are extremely ignorant of navigation, they freight their goods for Surat, and other Indian marts, in Engli&s;h and Dutch bottoms, at an exorbitant rate. The commo|dities of the Gombroon market are, fine wines of different kinds, rai&s;ins, almonds, ki&s;h-mi&s;hes, prunellas, dates, pi&s;tachio-nuts, ginger, &s;ilks, car|pets, leather, lapis-tutty, galbanum, ammoniac, a&s;a-faetida, tragacanth, with other gums, and a variety of &s;hop medicines. The&s;e are in a great mea&s;ure the produce of Carmania, which they bring to Gombroon in caravans. The Engli&s;h company had once a &s;mall factory in the province of Carmania, chiefly for the &s;ake of a fine wool produced there, and u&s;ed by the hatters. The &s;aid company had once a project of carrying a breed of the Per&s;ian goats to St. Helena, but whether it was executed, or what &s;ucce&s;s it met with, we can|not &s;ay. Although the company pay no cu&s;toms, yet they u&s;ually make a pre&s;ent to the &s;habander, to avoid the trouble he has it in his power to give

them. All private traders with the company's pa&s;&s;es, enjoy the &s;ame privileges, on paying two per cent. to the company; one to the agent, and one to the broker. All private trade, either by European or country &s;hips, has long been engro&s;&s;ed by the company's &s;ervants. The agent at I&s;pahan is one-third concerned, the chief of Gombroon one-third, and the re&s;t of the factors in Per&s;ia one-third, in all inve&s;tments; but for a particular ac|count of the company's trade and privileges, at this and other places in Per&s;ia, we mu&s;t refer the reader to Mr. Lockyer's account of the India trade, who wrote in 1711; though, no doubt, &s;ome material changes may have happened &s;ince that time, in con&s;equence of the civil wars with which this coun|try hath been long afflicted, &s;ince the death of Nadir Shah.</P>
<P>Near Gombroon are the i&s;lands of Ormus, Ba|hara, and Que&s;mo. The fir&s;t is two good leagues di&s;tant from the main land, almo&s;t at the mouth of the Per&s;ian Gulph, which reaches from thence to Ba&s;&s;ora. It is about &s;ix leagues, or twenty miles in circuit, but is quite barren, and has not a drop of fre&s;h water. They catch excellent oy&s;ters about the i&s;le, which al&s;o yields fine white &s;alt in great plenty, and a fine black &s;hining &s;and, u&s;ed for du&s;ting of writing, and tran&s;ported in con&s;idera|ble quantities to Europe. In the time of the Por|tugue&s;e there was a town upon it very rich and po|pulous, where all the trade of the Indies was managed; but that has been long in ruins, and there is nothing now inhabited but the fort. Bahara is remarkable for a pearl fi&s;hery, which begins in June and ends in Augu&s;t or September. The profit of it is computed at one hundred and ten thou&s;and crowns per annum, the pearls being the large&s;t, brighte&s;t, and rounde&s;t of any found in the Ea&s;t.</P>

Que&s;mo is a pretty large, fruitful, and well-in|habited i&s;land, furni&s;hing the neighbouring parts with wheat, barley, and other provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>Before we proceed, it will not be improper to add a word or two concerning the Per&s;ian Gulph, Gulph of Ba&s;&s;ora, or Sea of Eleatif, called in Latin Sinus Per&s;icus. This gulph flows out of the Indian ocean, near the i&s;le of Ormus, from the &s;outh-ea&s;t to the north-we&s;t, having Per&s;ia on the ea&s;t, and Arabia on the we&s;t, and running as nigh the antient Chal|dea, now called Ir&acirc;k Arabi, where it receives the Euphrates and the Tigris, united in one &s;tream; but very few rivers of any note be&s;ides. This Gulph was &s;ometimes &s;tiled by the antients the Red-Sea, as well as the Gulph of Aden. The pearl-fi&s;hery in this Gulph produces a prodigious quantity of pearl; Sir John Chardin &s;ays more than a million in a year: the large&s;t weighing generally from ten to twelve grains; and if by chance any are taken of greater weight, the fi&s;hers are directed, under great penalties, to bring them to the king's exchequer. This fi&s;hery is performed by divers, who being carried down to the bottom of the &s;ea in five fathom water, by the weight of a &s;tone fixed to their toes, they pick up there all the &s;hells they can &s;ee, as fa&s;t as they can, and put them into a ba&s;|ket they carry down with them on purpo&s;e, and then ri&s;e up again to take breath, and refre&s;h them&s;elves with a pipe of tobacco, while tho&s;e who are in the boat pull up the ba&s;kets. They fi&s;h for pearls all over the Gulph from the end of June to the end of September.</P>
<P>The province of Kere&s;tan, Kherman, Chirman, or Carmania, is bounded on the we&s;t by Far&s;i&s;tan; on the ea&s;t by Makram; on the &s;outh by the Per|&s;ian or Arabian Sea: and on the north by Sigi&s;tan. The greater part of this province, which is &s;aid to be inhabited by the Gaures, or antient Per&s;ians,
<PB N="309" REF="3100">
is barren and mountainous, but &s;ome of its vallies abound in odoriferous flowers, e&s;pecially ro&s;es, from which great quantities of ro&s;e-water are di&s;tilled, and &s;old at I&s;pahan. In the mountains are mines of copper and iron. This province is remarkable for producing &s;heep, which bear the fine&s;t wool in the world. They have this peculiar property, that, having fed upon new gra&s;s from January to May, the fleece falls off of it&s;elf, and leaves the &s;heep quite naked; the wool being gathered and beaten, the coar&s;e breaks, and the fine only remains. The Gaures have the whole manufacture of this wool in their hands, which con&s;i&s;ts in girdles, much e&s;teemed through the Ea&s;t, and in a &s;ort of &s;erges, as &s;oft, and almo&s;t as fine as &s;ilk. The chief towns in the province are Kherman, antiently Carmanae, Darab gerd, &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome to be the antient Pa&s;&s;agarda, and Bermazir. The fir&s;t is a con&s;ide|rable town, two hundred and &s;eventy-&s;ix miles from I&s;pahan to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, and is famous for the excellent &s;cymitars made in it. In the neigh|bourhood of Darab-gerd is a mine of &s;alt, and a rock, from which di&s;tils that valuable gum called mummy, a drachm of which will cure any brui&s;e, cut, or wound what&s;oever.</P>
<P>The &s;mall province of Makran, the antient Ge|dro&s;ia, is bounded on the ea&s;t by Guzarat, a pro|vince of India; on the we&s;t by Kare&s;tan; on the &s;outh by the Per&s;ian or Arabian Sea; and, on the north, by Sable&s;tan, with part of Sagi&s;tan. Mount Bacius, or rather a ridge of mountains, runs thro' the middle of this province, and from them &s;prings the river Arbis, or Arabis, which, after a &s;hort cour&s;e, falls into the Indian Sea. The &s;oil of this country is &s;andy and barren, very deficient in water, and the air intemperately hot. It is inha|bited by the Baluches, a fierce and warlike na|tion.
<PB N="310" REF="3110">
The principal places in it are, Firhk, Cha|lak$ and the port of Guadal.</P>
<P>The province of Sigi&s;tan, the antient Drangiana, has Chora&s;an on the north; part of Candahor, with Sable&s;tan, on the ea&s;t; Makran on the &s;outh; and Far&s;i&s;tan on the we&s;t. A ridge of mountains, the principal of which is called Ba|gous, runs through this country, and mo&s;t of the re&s;t of it is a &s;andy barren &s;oil. This province is chiefly noted, at pre&s;ent, for having been the birth-place of Ru&s;tan, the celebrated hero of O|riental romances. The places of any note in it are Si&s;tan, &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome to be the antient Proph|tha&s;ia, and Kets.</P>
<P>The province of Sable&s;tan or Sablu&s;tan, the an|tient Paropami&s;us, is bounded on the ea&s;t by the dominions of the great mogul; on the we&s;t by Sa|gi&s;tan; on the north by Candahor; and on the &s;outh by Makran. The &s;oil of this province in general is not very fruitful, con&s;i&s;ting mo&s;tly of hills, which, however, by over&s;hadowing the val|lies, render them cool and plea&s;ant. The principal town in it is Gazna. Of the others, Beck&s;abat, A&s;be, and Bu&s;t, are the mo&s;t con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>The province of Candahor has Sable&s;tan, with part of the mogul's empire, and Sage&s;tan, or Sigi&s;|tan, on the &s;outh; the country of Balk, of which an U&s;beck Tartar is prince, on the north; the empire of the mogul on the ea&s;t; and part of Chora&s;an and Sage&s;tan on the we&s;t. Though in general moun|tainous, it is far from being unfruitful, except on that &s;ide next Per&s;ia. The inhabitants are A&s;ghans, a fierce rude people. About the beginning of this century, they revolted, and took up arms, under the command of their khan Myrr-Weis, and his &s;on Myrr-Maghmud, again&s;t their &s;overeign &s;hah Ha&s;|&s;ein. Having laid &s;iege to and taken I&s;pahan, they murdered all the royal family, excepting prince

Thamas, who made his e&s;cape to the north of Per|&s;ia; but was afterwards, as hath been already re|lated, murdered by Nadir Shah, or Thamas Kouli Khan, who u&s;urped his throne.</P>
<P>This province takes its name from its capital, which &s;tands about &s;ix hundred and &s;eventy-five miles from I&s;pahan, towards the ea&s;t, on the borders of the mogul's empire. It is &s;aid to be large and &s;trongly fortified, and al&s;o a place of great wealth and trade, the caravans betwixt Per|&s;ia and the Indies con&s;tantly pa&s;&s;ing through it. This city had formerly princes of its own; but hath long been &s;ubject either to the great mogul or Per&s;ia.</P>
<P>Cora&s;an, or Khora&s;an, the antient Bactria and Aria, has Ir&acirc;k-Agemi, or Per&s;ian Ir&acirc;k, with A&s;tra|bad, on the we&s;t, from which it is parted by a large de&s;ert; Far&s;i&s;tan, with Sege&s;tan, and another large de&s;ert, that parts it from Kare&s;tan and Candahor, on the &s;outh; the mogul's dominions on the ea&s;t and north-ea&s;t; and U&s;beck Tartary on the north. Hence, it appears that it is a very large province. It is al&s;o very populous and fruitful, and produces the be&s;t manna in the world. The turquoi&s;e|&s;tones found here are &s;o excellent, that the king allows none to be &s;old but to him&s;elf. There are a great number of towns in this province, the chief of which are Herat, Ni&s;chabar, and Merou.</P>
<P>Herat, the Aria of the antients, is &s;aid to be thirteen miles in circumference, and &s;trongly forti|fied. They make very fine tape&s;try here, and a|bundance of ro&s;e water.</P>
<P>Mached, another city in this province, is very fa|mous for a pilgrimage in&s;tituted here in honour of the Iman Reza, by &s;hah Abas the Great. This he did with a political view, to divert the re&s;ort of his &s;ubjects to Mecca and Medina, whereby a great deal of gold was carried out of the kingdom; and,

as he knew that the people are much captivated with external &s;plendor, he &s;pared no expence in this re|&s;pect, even &s;o far as to cover with plates of gold the mo&s;que of this iman, who was always held in great veneration by the Per&s;ians. This city is &s;urround|ed with a noble wall, whereon &s;tand thirty towers.</P>
<P>E&s;terabad or A&s;trabad, with Khoemus, is &s;eat|ed in the north-we&s;t part of Per&s;ia, having Co|ra&s;an on the ea&s;t; part of Tartary on the north; Tabri&s;tan and the Ca&s;pian Sea on the we&s;t; and the latter al&s;o a little on the north; and a branch of Mount Taurus, with the De&s;ert of Sage&s;tan, on the &s;outh. It is a mountainous country, and barren; except near the banks of the two rivers Margah and Arias, where it is exceeding plea&s;ant and fruit|ful, producing grapes of a wonderful bigne&s;s. The inhabitants are a mixture of Per&s;ians and Tar|tars, or Turkmans. The towns of mo&s;t note are A&s;trabad, Amul, and Damkau.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t, which gives name to the province, &s;tands on a gulph or bay of the Ca&s;pian Sea, to which it al&s;o gives name. It is chiefly remarkable for the fine druggets, and other woolen goods, ma|nufactured there.</P>

<P>TURKY in A&s;ia is divided into Ea&s;tern and We&s;tern. The Ea&s;tern comprehends Georgia, Turcomania, and Diarbekhr; and the We&s;tern Anatolia, or the Le&s;&s;er A&s;ia, Syria, and Pale&s;tine.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>GEORGIA.</HEAD>
<P>About the etymon of the name of this country authors are not agreed. The mo&s;t probable opi|nion is, that it is a corruption or &s;oftening of Kur|gia, from the river Kur, whence al&s;o the inhabi|tants, as it is &s;uppo&s;ed, are called by the Per&s;ians indifferently Georgi, Gurgi, and Kurgi; and the country Gurgi&s;tan and Kurgi&s;tan.</P>
<P>Georgia is bounded on the north by Circa&s;&s;ia; on the ea&s;t by Daghe&s;tan and Shirvan; on the &s;outh by Armenia; and, on the we&s;t, by the Euxine or Black Sea; comprehending the greate&s;t part of the antient Colchis, Iberia, and Albania: but &s;ome
<PB N="314" REF="3160">
geographers, under the name Georgia, include all that va&s;t tract lying between the Ca&s;pian and Eux|ine Seas.</P>
<P>Georgia is divided by a ridge of mountains into Ea&s;tern and We&s;tern; the former of which is again &s;ubdivided into the kingdoms of Caket, Carduel or Carthuel, and Goguetia; and the latter into the provinces of Abca&s;&s;ia, Mireta or Imaretta, and Gu|riel. Another divi&s;ion is into Georgia Proper, Abca&s;&s;ia, and Mingrelia.</P>
<P>"Georgia (&s;ays Sir John Chardin) is as fertile a country as can be &s;een; the bread is as good here as in any part of the world; the fruit of an exqui|&s;ite flavour, and of different &s;orts; no place in Eu|rope yields better pears and apples; and no place in A&s;ia better pomegranates. The country abounds with cattle, veni&s;on, and wild-fowl, of all &s;orts; the river Kuris well &s;tocked with fi&s;h; and the wine is &s;o rich that the king of Per&s;ia has always &s;ome of it for his own table. The inhabitants are robu&s;t, valiant, and of a jovial temper; great lovers of wine, and e&s;teemed very tru&s;ty and faithful; en|dowed with good natural parts, but, for want of education, very vicious. The women are generally &s;o fair and comely, that the wives and concubines of the king of Per&s;ia, and his court, are for the mo&s;t part Georgian women. Nature has adorned them with graces no where el&s;e to be met with; it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ee them without loving them; they are of a good &s;ize, clean-limbed, and well &s;haped." Another traveller, however, of no mean character, thus expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf with re&s;pect to the women: "as to the Georgian women, they did not at all &s;urprize us; for we expected to find them perfect beauties. They are, indeed, no way di&s;a|greeable; and may be counted beauties, if com|pared with the Curdes. They have an air of health that is plea&s;ing enough; but, after all,
<PB N="315" REF="3170">
they are neither &s;o hand&s;ome nor &s;o well &s;haped as is reported. Tho&s;e who live in the towns have no|thing extraordinary, more than the others; &s;o that I may, I think, venture to contradict the accounts that have been given of them by mo&s;t travellers."</P>
<P>Georgia abounds with woods and mountains, intermixed with a great number of beautiful plains.</P>
<P>The only rivers of note in this country are the Cyrus, Cyrnus, Corus, or Kur, and the Aragus. The fir&s;t &s;prings from the Mo&s;chian mountains, which &s;eparate Colchis from Armenia, waters the country now called Mokan, and, after receiving in|to its channel the Aragus and Araxes, falls by one mouth into the Ca&s;pian Sea. This river is naviga|ble the greate&s;t part of its cour&s;e. The Aragus &s;prings from the mountains that &s;eparate Iberia from Colchis, and falls into the Cyrus.</P>
<P>Iberia, or Georgia, is tributary or &s;ubject either to the Porte or the king of Per&s;ia, and known to the Per&s;ians by the name of Gurgi&s;tan, that is, the Land of the Georgians; for tan is an antient Celtic word, &s;ignifying a country, and &s;till in u&s;e among the Ea&s;tern nations, as appears from the modern names of Curde&s;tan, Indo&s;tan, &amp;c. that is, the Country of the Curdes, of the Indians, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The whole country of Georgia is but thinly in|habited, and has but very few cities in proportion to its extent and fertility; which is doubtle&s;s, in a great mea&s;ure, owing to the barbarous and unnatu|ral traffic carried on here in boys and girls, parents &s;elling their children, ma&s;ters their &s;ervants, and lords their va&s;&s;als and tenants. Every one, in &s;hort, trades in the males and females he is ma&s;ter of, and di&s;po&s;es of them to the Turks and Per&s;ians, who employ them in their armies and &s;eraglios, as &s;laves, mutes, eunuchs, &s;oldiers, &s;tate&s;men, and concubines, according to their capacities, and the favour they have obtained with their ma&s;ters.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="3180">
This country formerly abounded with great ci|ties, as appears not only from its hi&s;tory, but fron the ruins of many of them &s;till vi&s;ible, which &s;hew that they mu&s;t have been very large, opulent, and magnificently built. The&s;e were all de&s;troyed by the inundations of northern barbarians from Mount Cauca&s;us, as the Alans, Huns, Suevi, and &s;ome others, &s;o much noted in hi&s;tory for their &s;trength, courage, and conque&s;ts.</P>
<P>The air of Georgia is &s;erene, dry, and healthful; but very cold in winter, and hot in &s;ummer.</P>
<P>The fine weather commonly begins about May, and la&s;ts till November; but the lands want a good deal of watering to make them produce a plenti|ful crop; when they yield all &s;orts of grain, fruit, and pul&s;e, in abundance, which &s;ell at &s;o cheap a rate that the people want for nothing. The cat|tle, both &s;mall and great, are fat and good and in great numbers; but the common people live mo&s;t|ly on &s;wine's fle&s;h, which is every where excellent, and, by their own account, whole&s;ome and of ea&s;y dige&s;tion. The river Kur, as well as the Ca&s;pian Sea, which lies ea&s;t of Georgia, &s;upplies it with plenty and variety of fi&s;h.</P>
<P>The mountains of Cauca&s;us, that lie partly in this country, are known at pre&s;ent to the inhabitants by the names of Cochas and Cochias, which are, with|out doubt, a corruption of the antient. The Arabs call them the Mountains of Raf.</P>
<P>The inhabitants are civil enough to &s;trangers, allowing them to live and trade as they plea&s;e, and to profe&s;s what religion they have a mind: hence people of various nations are &s;een here, as Turks, Armenians, Per&s;ians, Jews, Greeks, Indians, Tar|tars, Ru&s;&s;ians, and other Europeans; but the Ar|menians are the mo&s;t numerous, and, by carrying on the greate&s;t part of the trade, are al&s;o the rich|e&s;t; for which rea&s;on the Georgians hate and
<PB N="317" REF="3190">
de&s;pi&s;e them, regarding them in much the &s;ame light as the Europeans do the Jews. The Georgi|ans wear four caps on their heads, and a kind of long ve&s;t, open before, but which may be button|ed at plea&s;ure; their breeches and under-garments are like tho&s;e of the Per&s;ians, as is the entire dre&s;s of the women.</P>
<P>Their hou&s;es, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the better &s;ort, are al&s;o after the model of tho&s;e of Per&s;ia, as well as all their public buildings: and they may afford to have them built after the be&s;t manner, having not only &s;tone, wood, plai&s;ter, lime, and all other materials, in the greate&s;t plenty and cheapne&s;s; but al&s;o can have the mo&s;t laborious work done by their own va&s;&s;als, over whom they have &s;uch an ab|&s;olute power, that they can keep them employed whole months together, without allowing them ei|ther wages or food.</P>
<P>The religious tenets of the Georgians are much the &s;ame as tho&s;e of the Greek church; but, in re|gard to practice, they &s;eem to have retained nothing of Chri&s;tianity but the name, e&s;pecially the Min|grelians. The latter, indeed, as to the knowledge and practice of true Chri&s;tianity, are very little in|ferior to the former; and the chief difference is, that the former keep their fa&s;ts and fe&s;tivals more exactly, and u&s;e longer prayers than the latter. Neither &s;eem to know, much le&s;s to ob&s;erve, any precept of the go&s;pel. They are &s;aid to have re|ceived the Chri&s;tian faith about the middle of the fourth century. The churches in the cities are neat and well-built, and &s;ome of them even grand and &s;tately; but in the country they are generally mean, neglected, and decayed. The Georgians, as well as the other Chri&s;tians on the we&s;t and north, have a &s;trange cu&s;tom of building mo&s;t of their churches on the tops of high and almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible mountains, and at a di&s;tance from their towns;
<PB N="318" REF="3200">
and &s;o little u&s;e is generally made of them, that &s;ome of them are not opened once in ten years; a notion prevailing among&s;t them, that if they do but build a church in this manner, all their &s;ins will be forgiven them, though they &s;hould never &s;et their foot in it. They are under a patriarch, &s;tiled ca|tholicos, with an archbi&s;hop, and &s;everal bi&s;hops, which in Georgia Proper, that is &s;ubject to the king of Per&s;ia, are always appointed by the viceroy; who, though a Mohammedan, at lea&s;t in outward profe&s;&s;ion, commonly fills tho&s;e dignities with his own relations.</P>
<P>Iberia or Georgia, according to Jo&s;ephus, was fir&s;t peopled by Tubal, the brother of Gomer and Magog. His opinion is confirmed by the Septua|gint; for Me&s;hech and Tubal are by the&s;e inter|preters rendered Mo&s;chi and Iberians. We know little of the hi&s;tory of the country till the reign of Mithridates, when their king, named Artocis, &s;iding with that prince fir&s;t again&s;t Lucullus, and afterwards again&s;t Pompey, was defeated by the latter, with great &s;laughter; but afterwards obtain|ed a peace, upon delivering up his &s;ons as ho&s;tages. Little notice is taken of the &s;uccceding kings by the antient hi&s;torians. They were probably tribu|tary to the Romans till that empire was overturned, when this, with the other countries in A&s;ia border|ing on it, fell &s;ucce&s;&s;ively under the power of the Saracens and Turks. A certain prince of Georgia, named Heraclius, has lately made a great noi&s;e, and a con&s;iderable progre&s;s in his endeavours to &s;hake off the Turki&s;h yoke, having, according to advices from the Ea&s;t, &s;everal times defeated the Ottoman troops; but it &s;eems either his former good fortune for&s;ook him, or an accommodation took place; for all the intelligence from that part of the world, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, hath been entirely &s;ilent with regard to him.</P>

The following cities are mentioned by Strabo, Pliny, and Ptolemy, as formerly &s;ituated in this country; namely, Nubium, Varica, Sura, Artani&s;|&s;a, Me&s;tleta, Zali&s;&s;a, Armactica, and Phryxum, called afterwards Indee&s;&s;a. The principal modern ones, in that part between the Ca&s;pian Sea and the mountains of Georgia, properly &s;o called, and &s;ub|ject to Per&s;ia, are Teflis, the capital, Gori, Aly, Suram, Caket, and Zagan.</P>
<P>We &s;hall here only give the be&s;t account we can of the capital, the re&s;t being, in all appearance, incon&s;iderable, or at lea&s;t little known to European travellers.</P>
<P>Teflis or Taflis, the capital of Georgia, &s;tands near the confluence of the Cyrus or Kur, and the Iberus, an hundred and thirty miles we&s;t of the coa&s;t of the Ca&s;pian, and two hundred and twenty from that of the Euxine or Black Sea, in 42&deg;. 47&prime;. north latitude, and 47&deg;. 5&prime;. ea&s;t longitude, from the meridian of London. It is not large, but, according to Sir John Chardin, one of the fine&s;t cities in the Ea&s;t, with &s;trong walls on all &s;ides, except on the ea&s;t, where it is covered by the river Kur. On the &s;outh &s;ide of it &s;tands a large ca&s;tle or fortre&s;s, built by the Turks in 1576, when they made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the city and country, under the command of the famed Mu&s;ta|pha Pacha. The city is very populous, and a place of great trade, e&s;pecially in furs, which are conveyed hence to Con&s;tantinople, by the way of Erzerum. As for the &s;ilks of this country, they are bought up on the &s;pot by the Armenians, and con|veyed to Smyrna, and other ports of the Mediterra|nean; but the greate&s;t part of it is fir&s;t &s;ent to Erze|rum to be manufactured, the Georgians being very ignorant and un&s;kilful in that re&s;pect. From hence, likewi&s;e, great quantities of a root, called boya, is &s;ent to Erzerum and Indo&s;tan, for the u&s;e of the li|nen

dyers. There are &s;ome magnificent caravan|&s;eras, bazars, and palaces, in the city. Of the la&s;t, tho&s;e of the viceroys of Carthuel and Caket are the chief. They reckon no le&s;s than fourteen churches in the city; one half of them belonging to the Georgians, and the other to the Armenians. As for mo&s;ques, the Georgians, it is &s;aid, have never &s;uf|fered any to be built, tho' they are under a Moham|medan government; but have always ri&s;en up in arms as often as any attempt has been made to erect &s;uch, and de&s;troyed them. Here are &s;ome Romi&s;h Capuchins, as mi&s;&s;ionaries; but they go under the denomination of phy&s;icians, &s;urgeons, or chymi&s;ts, which three profe&s;&s;ions are in great e&s;teem in the Ea&s;t. The great cures they make, and the &s;mall fees they take, which are generally in wine, meal, cattle, or young &s;laves, procure them &s;ome e&s;teem, though they are often expo&s;ed to the in&s;ults of the people, e&s;pecially when they attempt to make any pro&s;elytes to their church. The inhabitants of Teflis are computed at near twenty thou&s;and; viz. four thou&s;and Armenians, three thou&s;and Moham|medans, two thou&s;and Georgians, and about five hundred Romi&s;h Armenians, who are much hated by the others: the re&s;t are Per&s;ians, or &s;trangers, that are continually coming and going.</P>
<P>That part of the we&s;tern Georgia, now called Mingrelia, and antiently Colchis, is bounded on the ea&s;t by Iberia, or Georgia; properly &s;o called; on the we&s;t by the Euxine Sea; on the &s;outh by Armenia, and part of Pontus; and on the north by Mount Cauca&s;us.</P>
<P>Colchis or Mingrelia is watered by a great many rivers; as the Corax, the Hippus, the Cyaneus, the Chari&s;tus, the Pha&s;is, where the Argonauts landed, the Ab&s;arus, the Ci&s;&s;a, and the Ophis, all emptying them&s;elves into the Euxine Sea. The Pha&s;is does not &s;pring from the mountains of

Armenia, near the &s;ources of the Euphrates, the Araxes, and the Tygris, as Strabo, Ptolemy, Pli|ny, Diony&s;ius, and after them Arrian, Reland, Calmet, and San&s;on, have fal&s;ly a&s;&s;erted; but ri&s;es on Mount Cauca&s;us, and flows not from &s;outh to north, but from north to &s;outh, as appears from the map of Colchis or Mingrelia, in Thevenot's collection, and the account which Sir John Char|din gives of that country. This river forms in its cour&s;e a &s;mall i&s;land, called al&s;o Pha&s;is; whence the phea&s;ants, if I&s;idorus is to be credited, were fir&s;t brought to Europe, and thence called by the Greeks Pha&s;iani. The other rivers of Colchis are not con|&s;iderable.</P>
<P>The whole kingdom of Colchis was in antient times very plea&s;ant and fruitful, as it is &s;till, where duly cultivated, abounded in all the nece&s;&s;aries of life, and was enriched with many mines of gold, which gave occa&s;ion to the fable of the Golden Fleece, and the Argonautic expedition, &s;o much celebrated by the antients. The&s;e mines are &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome mythologi&s;ts to have been contiguous to &s;ome of tho&s;e torrents which fall from the neigh|bourhood of Mount Cauca&s;us, and to have brought down with them &s;ome gold-du&s;t, which the inhabitants &s;aved by &s;etting fleeces of wool acro&s;s &s;ome of the narrow pa&s;&s;ages of tho&s;e cur|rents. This is indeed the mo&s;t rational account that can be given of that matter, which the fabulous poets afterwards di&s;gui&s;ed, according to their cu&s;|tom, and embelli&s;hed with the &s;tories of dragons, brazen bulls, dreadful &s;eas, dangerous pa&s;&s;ages, and many &s;uch perils, and in&s;urmountable difficul|ties, as commonly attend the too eager pur&s;uit of that pernicious, tho' &s;o much de&s;ired, metal. The country of Colchis, abounding al&s;o with poi&s;onous drugs and plants, which Medea, king Aeetes's daugh|ter, knew how to prepare and make u&s;e of, the

poets thought fit to turn her into a &s;orcere&s;s or en|chantre&s;s.</P>
<P>The Argonauts landed in the river Pha&s;is, which gave ri&s;e to the Greek proverb "to &s;ail to Pha&s;is," expre&s;&s;ing a long and dangerous navigation; for &s;uch was that of the Argonauts e&s;teemed in tho&s;e early times. The fable of Phryxus, and his &s;i&s;ter Helle, took its ri&s;e from their flying from their &s;tep|mother Ino to Colchis in a &s;hip, on who&s;e head was a golden or rather a gilt ram, where they were kind|ly received by Aeetes.</P>
<P>The Argonautic expedition is &s;uppo&s;ed to have happened before the &s;iege of Troy, about the time that Gideon was judge of I&s;rael, and the year of the world 2700.</P>
<P>The late&s;t account we have of this country is from Sir John Chardin, who tells us, that its length is above an hundred miles, and its breadth &s;ixty, being not near &s;o exten&s;ive as the antient Colchis, which reached from the frontiers of Iberia or Georgia Proper, we&s;tward to the Palus Maeotis: that it is beautifully diver&s;ified with hills, moun|tains, valleys, woods, and plains, but badly culti|vated: that there are all the kinds of fruits which are found in England, growing wild, but ta&s;tele&s;s and in&s;ipid, for want of culture: that, if the na|tives under&s;tood the art of making wines, tho&s;e of this country would be the fine&s;t in the world: that there are many rivers, which have their &s;ource in Mount Cauca&s;us, particularly the Pha&s;is, now called the Rione: that the country abounds in beeves, hogs, wild boars, &s;tags, and other veni&s;on, and in partridges, phea&s;ants, and quails: that fal|cons, eagles, pelicans, lions, leopards, tigers, wolves, and jackals, breed on Mount Cauca&s;us, and &s;ometimes greatly annoy the country: that the people are generally hand&s;ome, the men &s;trong and well made, and the women very beautiful; but
<PB N="323" REF="3250">
both &s;exes very vicious and debauched: that they marry their nieces, aunts, or other relations, indif|ferently; and take two or three wives, if they plea&s;e, and as many concubines as they will: that they not only make a common practice of &s;elling their children, but even murder them, or bury them alive, when they find it difficult to bring them up: that the common people u&s;e a &s;ort of pa&s;te, made of a plant called gom, in&s;tead of bread; but that that of the better &s;ort con&s;i&s;ts of wheat, bar|ley, or rice: that the gentry have an ab&s;olute power over their va&s;&s;als, which extends to life, liberty, and e&s;tate: that their arms are the bow and ar|row, the lance, the &s;abre or broad-&s;word, and the buckler: that they are very na&s;ty, and eat &s;itting cro&s;s-legged upon a carpet, like the Per&s;ians; but the poorer &s;ort upon a mat or bench, in the &s;ame po&s;ture: that the country is very thin of inhabi|tants, no le&s;s than twelve thou&s;and being &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;old yearly to the Turks and Per&s;ians: that the principal commodities exported from it are honey, wax, hides, ca&s;tor, martin-&s;kins, flax|&s;eed, thread, &s;ilk, and linen cloth; but that there are no gold or &s;ilver mines now, and very little money: that the revenue of the prince or viceroy amounts to about twenty thou&s;and crowns per annum: that the inhabitants call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians; but that both they and their prie&s;ts are altogether illi|terate, and ignorant of the doctrines and precepts of Chri&s;tianity: that their bi&s;hops are rich, have a great number of va&s;&s;als, and are cloathed in &s;carlet and velvet: and that their &s;ervice is according to the rites of the Greek church, with a mixture of Ju|dai&s;m and Pagani&s;m.</P>
<P>The cities of mo&s;t note in this country in antient times were, Pityus; Dio&s;curias, or Dio&s;corias, which was &s;o called from Ca&s;tor and Pollux, two of the Argonauts, by whom it is &s;uppo&s;ed to have
<PB N="324" REF="3260">
been founded, and who in Greek are &s;tiled Dio&s;cu|roi, at pre&s;ent known by the name of Savatapoli; Aea on the Pha&s;is, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the &s;ame as Hu|polis; Pha&s;is, &s;o called from the river on which it &s;tood; Cyta, at the mouth of the river Cyaneus, the birth-place of the famous Medea, called from thence, by the poets, Cytaeis; Saracae, Zadris, Su|rium, Madia, and Zaliffa.</P>
<P>As for modern cities, it does not appear that there are any here con&s;iderable enough to merit a de&s;cription; or, if there are, they &s;eem to be little, if at all, known to Europeans.</P>
<P>In We&s;tern Georgia, be&s;ides Mingrelia, are two other principalities, namely, Imaritia or Imaretta, and Abca&s;&s;ia or Aba&s;&s;ia, the princes of which are tributary to the grand &s;eignior. They lie to the &s;outh of Mingrelia, along the Euxine Sea. The fir&s;t is &s;aid to be about an hundred and twenty miles in length, and &s;ixty in breadth; being a hilly, woody country, with &s;ome large plains and val|lies between, which produce corn, pul&s;e, cattle, and other nece&s;&s;aries, more plentifully than in Mingre|lia. Here are al&s;o iron mines, which yield large quantities of that metal, and very good in its kind. Money is coined, and a con&s;iderable com|merce is carried on, in this country, e&s;pecially in the towns, of which the chief are Cotatis and Akal|ziki. The former &s;tands on the Pha&s;is, in latitude 42&deg;. 23&prime;. longitude 43&deg;. 54&prime;. ea&s;t; the latter on Mount Cauca&s;us, near the banks of the Kur, in latitude 41&deg;. 55&prime;. and 44&deg;. 55&prime;. of ea&s;t longitude. They are both but mean places, and both the re&s;i|dences of Turki&s;h ba&s;has.</P>
<P>Abca&s;&s;ia lies the farthe&s;t north of all the&s;e coun|tries; having the Euxine Sea on the &s;outh, Cir|ca&s;&s;ia on the we&s;t, and Mount Cauca&s;us on the north and ea&s;t. Sir John Chardin calls the inhabi|tants Abcas, and looks upon the country as a part of
<PB N="325" REF="3270">
Circa&s;&s;ia. The only traffic carried on here, ex|cepting &s;ome &s;kins of deer, tygers, &amp;c. and &s;ome thread, wax, honey, and box-wood, is in &s;laves, which they barter with the merchants that come upon their coa&s;t, for what commodities they want. The Abca&s;&s;es were once Chri&s;tians; but at pre&s;ent they are little better than mere &s;avages, hardly knowing any thing, even of natural religion. They live in mean low huts, and go almo&s;t naked.</P>
<P>The Mamalukes, that once made &s;uch a figure in Egypt and A&s;ia, and had &s;uch a long conte&s;t with the Turks for &s;uperiority, were originally no other than children bought in Georgia, and carried into Egypt, where, being bred to arms, they com|po&s;ed a body like that of the Janizaries in Turky. At la&s;t, their number and power increa&s;ed to &s;uch a degree, and they became &s;o in&s;olent, mutinous, and ungovernable, that in the end they revolted again&s;t their ma&s;ters, and u&s;urped the Egyptian throne.</P>
<P>To the north of Georgia, taken in the &s;tricter &s;en&s;e, lie the provinces or countries of Comania, Circa&s;&s;ia, and Dage&s;tan, which by &s;ome geographers are comprehended under the general name of Georgia.</P>
<P>Comania is bounded by the Ca&s;pian Sea on the ea&s;t; by a ridge of mountains, which part it from Circa&s;&s;ia, on the we&s;t; by A&s;iatic Mu&s;covy on the north, from which it is divided by the river Terki; and by Georgia on the &s;outh.</P>
<P>A con&s;iderable part of the country is flat, low, rich, and fertile; but thinly inhabited, and badly cultivated. Several rivers run acro&s;s it, de&s;cend|ing chiefly from the mountains mentioned above, which are branches or arms of Cauca&s;us. The cli|mate is moderately cold, and pretty much &s;ubject to rains.</P>
<P>The inhabitants, called Comani, Kamouches, or Camouches, like their neighbours, live mo&s;tly by
<PB N="326" REF="3280">
plunder. They are under the protection of the kings of Per&s;ia, who are very careful to cultivate their friend&s;hip, as they guard the pa&s;&s;es on that &s;ide, and prevent the Kalmucks, and other enemies of Per&s;ia, from making inroads upon them. Both men and women are clothed in Per&s;ian linen and &s;ilks, after the manner of tho&s;e of Little Tartary; that is, the former in &s;hort jackets and drawers, and the latter in long loo&s;e gowns, not unlike our women's &s;hifts. They have no towns; but only villages or hamlets, con&s;i&s;ting of about fifty or &s;ixty huts. Their chief food is the milk and fle&s;h of their cattle, game, &s;uch fruits as the country &s;pontane|ou&s;ly produces, honey, and rice; the la&s;t of which they have from Per&s;ia.</P>
<P>Circa&s;&s;ia lies between the Don or Tanais, and the Wolga; having the former on the north-we&s;t, and the latter on the north-ea&s;t; with the Ca&s;pian Sea on the ea&s;t; and Daghe&s;tan, Mingrelia, Ca|ket, &amp;c. on the &s;outh, from which it is parted by a branch of Mount Cauca&s;us. According to Sir John Chardin, it is full of mountains and woods; and extends above &s;ix hundred miles, from the Palus Maeotis to Mingrelia. The Circa&s;&s;ians are neither &s;ubject nor tributary to the Porte. As to the climate, it is cold and moi&s;t, and yet the inhabi|bitants go half naked.</P>
<P>The commodities of the country are men, wo|men, and children, honey, wax, furs, leather, and the &s;kins of wild bea&s;ts, which they hunt and kill in the mountains; all which they barter for rice, linen, &s;ilks, and other things they &s;tand in need of. They were formerly Chri&s;tians; but now have no|thing left of that or any other religion, but &s;ome ab&s;urd &s;uper&s;titious ceremonies. They have no bread, but what is made of a kind of &s;mall grain like our millet.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="3290">
Olearius tells us, that there are &s;ome cities, at lea&s;t on the ea&s;tern &s;ide, towards the Ca&s;pian Sea, one, in particular, called Terchi: that the inhabi|tants are generally well &s;haped and robu&s;t, of a &s;al|low complexion, with long black hair: that they practi&s;e circumci&s;ion, and allow of polygamy, like the Jews: but have neither Bible nor Alcoran, neither prie&s;ts nor place of wor&s;hip; being, in all other re&s;pects, mere heathens: that their language is the &s;ame that is &s;poken by all the Tartarian na|tions on this &s;ide Cauca&s;us; but that mo&s;t of the Circa&s;&s;ians under&s;tand likewi&s;e the Ru&s;&s;ian lan|guage. The &s;ame traveller repre&s;ents them as much more civilized, affable, and ho&s;pitable, than the inhabitants of Mingrelia, and the neighbouring countries. Their capital, Terchi, is &s;aid to be &s;i|tuated, on the coa&s;t of the Ca&s;pian Sea, in latitude 43&deg;. 25&prime;. and longitude 49&deg;. 30&prime;. &s;ixty leagues from A&s;tracan by &s;ea, and &s;eventy by land, and to have a garri&s;on of Ru&s;&s;ians; for though the coun|try is &s;ubject to its own princes, yet the&s;e are all tributary to Ru&s;&s;ia, and obliged to take an oath of allegiance to the emperor or empre&s;s thereof. The hou&s;es of Terchi are all of wood, as they common|ly are in tho&s;e parts; but the town is pretty well fortified, and has a garri&s;on of two thou&s;and Ru&s;|&s;ians, of which fifteen hundred are under the way|wode or governor, and the other five hundred the guard of the Circa&s;&s;ian prince, but paid by the Ru&s;|&s;ians. The only other city of any note in this coun|try, mentioned by travellers, is Cabardei, the capital of a di&s;trict or territory, called from thence Cabar|dinia.</P>
<P>Dage&s;tan, Daghe&s;tan, Dache&s;tan, or Dagg-E&s;|tan, is bounded on the ea&s;t by the Ca&s;pian Sea; on the we&s;t by Mount Cauca&s;us; on the north by Circa&s;&s;ia, from which it is parted by the river Bu&s;tro; and on the &s;outh by the province of Schir|wan, belonging to Per&s;ia. It is a mountainous
<PB N="328" REF="3300">
country, rather under the protection of Per&s;ia than &s;ubject to it. The inhabitants, who call them&s;elves Daghe&s;tan Tartars, that is, Tartarian Mountaineers, from dagg, a mountain, and tan, a country, are reckoned among the fierce&s;t and mo&s;t barbarous people in all the Ea&s;t, and &s;uppo&s;ed to be de&s;cend|ed from the antient Parthians, &s;o famed in hi&s;tory for their bravery and courage. Some geographers will have Daghe&s;tan to be a part of Albania, which Quintus Curtius makes the country of the famed Thale&s;tris, queen of the Amazons, who went to meet Alexander the Great as far as Hyrcania.</P>
<P>The Daghe&s;tan Tartars extend them&s;elves about forty leagues along the Ca&s;pian coa&s;ts, from Terki, capital of Circa&s;&s;ia, to Tarchu, their own capital, and even beyond it.</P>
<P>They u&s;e circumci&s;ion, and other rites of Mo|hammedi&s;m; but under&s;tand little, and practi&s;e le&s;s, of that or any other religion. Their arms are ei|ther defen&s;ive or offen&s;ive: among the former are the coat of mail, helmet, and buckler; and among the latter, the broad-&s;word, bow and arrow, dart, lance, &amp;c. Like the other Tartars inhabiting Georgia, they are continually robbing and plunder|ing their neighbours; and not only &s;ell the children, and others, that they carry off on the&s;e occa&s;ions, but even their own children and relations, to the Per&s;ians, and other &s;trangers. No caravans venture to pa&s;s through the country, without a &s;trong e&s;cort.</P>
<P>Daghe&s;tan is not, like &s;ome of the provinces we have lately de&s;cribed, &s;ubject to one &s;ole monarch, tributary to the Per&s;ians, Turks, or Mu&s;covites; but has almo&s;t as many petty lords or tyrants, call|ed mur&s;as, as their are towns in it. They chu&s;e, however, from among them, one to be the chief of the re&s;t, who is &s;tiled &s;hemkal.</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="3310">
Tarchu, the capital, mentioned above, is &s;ituated on the we&s;tern coa&s;t of the Ca&s;pian Sea, about forty miles north of Derbent, and &s;ixty-five &s;outh of Terki, in Circa&s;&s;ia. It con&s;i&s;ts of about a thou&s;and wooden hou&s;es, built after the Per&s;ian manner, but in a homelier &s;tile. The male inhabitants are &s;aid to be very fierce, cruel, and mi&s;chie|vous; but the females are repre&s;ented as very com|plai&s;ant, and civil to &s;trangers.</P>
<P>As we pre&s;ume it will not be unacceptable to our readers, we &s;hall clo&s;e our account of Georgia with a &s;hort de&s;cription of Mount Cauca&s;us, and the Euxine Sea.</P>
<P>Mount Cauca&s;us lying between the Euxine and Ca&s;pian Seas, and deriving its name, according to Bochart, from Gog-ha&s;an, i. e. Gog's or Magog's Fort, but more probably from Caf, Caco, or Coho, in Per&s;ic, denoting mountains or a mountainous tract of land, is one of the highe&s;t mountains, or rather chains of mountains, in the world. It is almo&s;t covered with fir trees, and full of rocks and terrible precipices, in which, with great labour, paths have been cut out for the convenience of pa&s;&s;age; which is neverthele&s;s very difficult, even in &s;ummer, by rea&s;on of its &s;teepne&s;s, but in winter much more &s;o, in con&s;equence of the ice and &s;now, which, in &s;ome of the highe&s;t parts, lie almo&s;t the whole year. In pa&s;&s;ing over it, in winter, a high wind is very dan|gerous; for the drifts of &s;now occa&s;ioned by it &s;ometimes de&s;troy both man and hor&s;e.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;age over this mountain is computed at about one hundred and eighteen, or one hund|red and twenty miles; but there are &s;everal villag|es by the way, where one finds plenty of pro|vi&s;ions. The &s;oil in general is very fruitful, even to the top, producing corn, wine, fruits, honey, cattle, &amp;c. in abundance, and very good in their kind, which is principally owing to the rich ma+nure
<PB N="330" REF="3320">
manthat the &s;now yields. The inhabitants breed great numbers of &s;wine, which are very fat, and delicious; they have al&s;o good &s;tore of poultry, eggs, pul&s;e, bread and fruit. Tho' &s;ubjects to the Turks, they are all chri&s;tians, and much more civilized than the Mingrelians. They live in wooden huts, of which every family hath four or five, of different &s;izes. Such is the account given of mount Cauca&s;us, and its inhabitants by Sir John Chardin: another traveller tells us, that it is inhabited by many different hords or tribe of Savage Tartars, who &s;peak different languages $Span$ each other; that they all pretend to be chri&s;tians, tho' there is neither faith, nor devotion to be found among them; that they make no u&s;e of coin, but barter one thing for another, that one cu&s;tom prevails among all the different hords, namely, that of making in|roads on one another, and carrying off what males or females they can catch, in order to &s;ell them for &s;laves.</P>
<P>As for the extent, different branches, names and windings, &amp;c. of Cauca&s;us, nothing certain can be advanced concerning them, &s;o widely do authors differ in their account of them. It &s;eems there are only two places, where it is pa&s;&s;able. The&s;e were antiently called Portae or Gates, the one the Cauca&s;ian, and the other the Ca&s;pian. The latter &s;till retains its name; but the former hath changed it into that of Tzur. We now pro|ceed to the Euxine &s;ea.</P>
<P>The Pontus Axinus, as it was fir&s;t called by the Greeks, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have derived its name from A&s;hkenaz, Gomer's elde&s;t &s;on, by who&s;e de&s;cendants the neighbouring country is thought to have been planted. In the opinion of the antients, it was only a lake or &s;tanding pool, which, being overcharged with waters, fir&s;t broke
<PB N="331" REF="3330">
into the Propontis, and then into the Aegean &s;ea, wa&s;hing away by degrees the land, that kept it with|in its fir&s;t bounds, and forming the two channels of the Bo&s;phorus Thracius, and the Helle&s;pont, which Helle&s;pont, in the &s;en&s;e of the antients, is ano|ther Bo&s;phorus, i. e. an arm of the &s;ea, narrow enough for an ox to &s;wim over In the hypothe|&s;is of the antients, the Palus Maeotis, the Euxine &s;ea, the Propontis and Mediterranean, were ori|ginally &s;o many lakes, which, after having broke down, as it were, the dykes, that parted them, with the impetuo&s;ity of their waters, opened them|&s;elves a pa&s;&s;age between the mountains of Atlas and Calpe into the ocean: But it is more likely that the ocean, having with the impetuo&s;ity of its waves, di&s;membered the mountain of Calpe from the coa&s;t of Africa, poured it &s;elf into the va&s;t &s;pace now called the Mediterranean, and pene|trating to the north, produced the Propontis, the Pontus and the Palus Maeotis The Euxine is now commonly called the black &s;ea, tho', as Mr. Tournefort ob&s;erves, it has nothing black but the name. Pomponius Mela &s;ays, it was called Pontus Axinus by the Greeks, on account of the inho&s;pitality, or boi&s;terou&s;ne&s;s of its waves, and the barbarity of the people, that lived around its coa&s;ts. With regard to the latter of the&s;e rea|&s;ons, it is likely enough to have been &s;trictly true; &s;ince, from what we have &s;aid above, it ap|pears, that the inhabitants of its coa&s;ts may &s;till very ju&s;tly be denominated barbarous; but, with regard to the former, the &s;ame Mr. Tournefort a&s;&s;ures us, that the winds are neither more furious nor frequent than in other &s;eas; the &s;eeming dark|ne&s;s and danger of its coa&s;t, being rather owing to the thick woods, that over&s;hadow them, and make them look black, and gloomy at a di&s;tance.

&s;uch as are un&s;heltered, and expo&s;ed to all winds. It extends about three hundred leagues, or nine hundred miles from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and about three hundred and eighty from &s;outh to north, viz. from the Bo&s;phorus or &s;traight of Con&s;tantinople to the mouth of the Nieper, or Bori&s;thenes; but towards the ea&s;t it grows narrower. It is encom|pa&s;&s;ed by the Crim or le&s;&s;er Tartary, and Cir|ca&s;&s;ia on the north; Anatolia, or A&s;ia Minor, on the &s;outh; Turkey in Europe on the we&s;t, and Georgia, and Mingrelia on the ea&s;t The Turks, who navigate this &s;ea, or rather coa&s;t it in &s;mall barks, called &s;aicks, are very ignorant of the art of navigation, and the working of &s;hips: They have no charts, and hardly know any thing of the Mariner's compa&s;s. No Franks are &s;uffered to traffic on this &s;ea, notwith&s;tanding the advan|tages that would redound to the Porte from &s;uch a permi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The water of the Euxine is fre&s;her and clearer than that of other &s;eas, which is partly owing to the &s;mall communication it hath with the Me|diterranean, and partly to the number of large rivers that fall into it; the chief of which are the Danube, the Don or Tanais, the Nieper, or Bori&s;thenes, the Pha&s;is, or Rione, and the Nie&s;ter. As for the Palus Maeotis, or &s;ea of Azoph, with which it hath a communication by the Straights of Caffa, antiently called Bo&s;phorus Cimmerius, lit|tle can be &s;aid upon good authority. It is &s;urround|ed, on the we&s;t by Crim-Tartary; on the ea&s;t and &s;outh partly by Circa&s;&s;ia, and partly by the Euxine, and on the north by part of the le&s;&s;er Tartary. Mo&s;t parts of it are repre&s;ented as very &s;hallow: As for its name of Maeotis, it had it, we are told, from the Maeotici, or Maeotides, which were the antient inhabitants of its coa&s;ts.</P>

<HEAD>TURCOMANIA.</HEAD>
<P>Turcomania, the antient Armenia Major, and the &s;econd province or divi&s;ion of the ea&s;tern A&s;iatic Turkey, is bounded on the &s;outh by Me&s;opotamia; on the north by Georgia; on the ea&s;t by Per&s;ia, and on the we&s;t by Cappa|docia, and the Le&s;&s;er Armenia, from which it is parted by the river Euphrates. Its extent from South to north is &s;omewhat above two hundred miles, or from about 38&deg;. 20&prime;. to almo&s;t 42&deg;. of north Lat. and from 39&deg;. to almo&s;t 42&deg;. of ea&s;t long. or about three hundred miles from we&s;t to ea&s;t.</P>
<P>This country is very hilly and mountainous; but the hills are here and there inter&s;per&s;ed with fruitful and mo&s;t beautiful dales, and valleys. All &s;orts of grain are but very indifferent in Armenia: in mo&s;t places it yields but four-fold. If they had not the convenience of watering their lands, they would almo&s;t be quite barren. What the country produces is owing in a great mea&s;ure to the painfull labour of the inhabitants, who either actually water it by hand, or dig trenches and other conveniencies of that kind, for the fertilizing of their fields. The Wine of this coun|try is repre&s;ented as very indifferent by the ge|nerality of our modern travellers, and as for the Olive, Mr. Tournefort &s;ays, it is not to be found here, nor in any part of A&s;ia beyond Aleppo, except in one &s;ingle place, near Ca&s;bin in Per&s;ia. However it &s;eems to have been otherwi&s;e an|tiently; for we are told by Strabo, that the Ol|ive grew in Gogarene, a province of Armenia. The cold is &s;o extroardinary here, that all man|ner of fruit are more backward than in mo&s;t of the northern countries. The hills are covered
<PB N="334" REF="3360">
with &s;now the whole year round, and it &s;ome|times falls even in the month of June. Lucul|lus when appointed to command the Roman ar|my in Armenia, was greatly &s;urprized to find the whole country covered with &s;now at the Autumnal equinox, to &s;ee mo&s;t of the rivers frozen up, and great numbers of his troops dying every day, by rea&s;on of the coldne&s;s of the waters. Alexander Severus was no better plea&s;ed with this country; having lo&s;t on his march thro it, great part of his army; the cold being then &s;o exce&s;&s;ive that many of the &s;oldiers, as Zonarus informs us, were frozen under their tents, and others lo&s;t their hands, and feet, by being obliged to encamp in the &s;now.</P>
<P>A modern traveller tells us, that, even in the middle of July he often found ice about the &s;prings before the ri&s;ing of the &s;un, notwith&s;tand|ing it was exceeding hot in the day time; this cold keeps every thing &s;o back, that the corn, he ob&s;erves, was not, at that time of the year, a foot high, and the other fruits of the earth &s;carce &s;o forward as they are about Paris at the end of April. Their method of plowing the land is &s;omewhat &s;ingular; for they u&s;ually put to one plough ten or twelve yoke of oxen; each yoke having a driver, and this to make deeper furrows; experience having taught them, that it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to go very deep either to correct the up|per &s;oil, which is too dry, with that which lies beneath, and is le&s;s &s;o, or to pre&s;erve the &s;eed from the hard fro&s;t; for were it not on &s;ome &s;uch con&s;ideration, they would not be at &s;uch ex|pence. Notwith&s;tanding all this, we are told, that the corn would be quite burnt up, were not the fields frequently watered, either by hand or by trenches dug for that purpo&s;e. Perhaps great plenty of water is nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;&s;olve the &s;alt and
<PB N="335" REF="3370">
nitre, with which the &s;oil in mo&s;t parts of Arme|nia is impregnated, and which would burn up the roots, if the clods were not well moi&s;tened with a proportionable quantity of liquid. The rivers which pa&s;s through this country, or along its borders, are the Lycus, the Pha&s;is, the Cyrus, Araxis, called by the Turks Aras, the Tigris, and Euphrates. The principal mountains are tho&s;e of Ararat, where the Ark is &s;uppo&s;ed to have re&s;t|ed, the Mo&s;chick mountains, the Paryadrae, Ma|ru&s;ius, Antitaurus, Niphates, Abus, and the Gor|dyaean mountains.</P>
<P>The modern Chri&s;tian Armenians u&s;e two languages, the vulgar, and the learned; the lat|ter, if we will believe them, has no affinity with the other oriental languages, is very expre&s;&s;ive, and enriched with all the terms of religion and of arts and &s;ciences; which if true, &s;hews that the Arme|nians were formerly men of much greater learn|ing than they are at pre&s;ent. This language is to be found only in their antient manu&s;cripts, and is u&s;ed in divine &s;ervice. To under&s;tand it well, is reckoned a great accompli&s;hment, and is all that is requi&s;ite to be admitted into the or|der of Vertabiets, who make &s;uch a noi&s;e among the Armenians. The Vertabiets are doctors, and their province is to preach, and in&s;truct the peo|ple; when they once under&s;tand the learned lan|guage, and have got by heart a few &s;ermons of Gregory Altena&s;i, a great ma&s;ter of it, and, as we may call him, their chief cla&s;&s;ic, they are a|bundantly qualified for that eminent degree.</P>
<P>As to their religious tenets, they hold no com|munion, either with the Greek or Roman church, nor yet with the Ne&s;torians; but they are more irreconcilable to the two former, e&s;pecially to the Greek, by whom they are excommunicated, and they excommunicate in their turn. The&s;e
<PB N="336" REF="3380">
three &s;ects have &s;uch an antipathy to one ano|ther that rhey think their churches profaned, if any of the other come into it, and hold them|&s;elves obliged to &s;anctify it a-fre&s;h. They are accu&s;ed of Eutychiani&s;m, that is of acknowledg|ing but one nature in Chri&s;t. The truth is, they are gro&s;sly ignorant, and implicitly follow cer|tain doctors, who were favourers of the Eutychi|an here&s;y, as the &s;tandard of their faith. They have two Patriarchs in Turky, namely one in this province, and another in Cilicia, be&s;ides o|thers in other countries, as Per&s;ia, Poland, &amp;c. Under the two in Turkey are thirty bi&s;hops, be|&s;ides a va&s;t number of monks. The &s;ecular prie&s;ts are allowed to marry only once, and generally follow &s;ome trade or bu&s;ine&s;s to maintain their families; for there is little to be got by their function. Be&s;ides allowing but one nature in Chri&s;t, they deny Purgatory, tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, and prayers for the dead; ab&s;tain from blood, things &s;trangled, and from unclean bea&s;ts. After they have baptized infants, they hold them over the fire, which they call baptizing with water and with fire, according to the literal meaning of St. John the bapti&s;t; and, on the Chri&s;tmas en&s;u|ing, admit them to the communion.</P>
<P>The Vertabiets, mentioned above, are ordained; but their proper function is to preach. Their &s;ermons generally turn upon ill-formed parables, upon pa&s;&s;ages of the &s;cripture ill under&s;tood, and wor&s;e explained, and upon ridiculous traditions: however, they deliver them&s;elves with a great deal of gravity; and the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es procure them as much credit and authority as the patriarch him&s;elf has. They challenge the &s;ole power of excommunica|tion. After exerci&s;ing them&s;elves for &s;ome time in the villages and boroughs, they are, with abun|dance of ceremonies, admitted to the degree of doc|tor
<PB N="337" REF="3390">
by an old vertablet, who puts into their hands a pa&s;toral &s;taff, which they are allowed to hold, while they preach, and al&s;o to &s;it; whereas the bi&s;hops, who are not vertabiets, are obliged to preach &s;tanding. They live on the collections that are made for them after their &s;ermons, which, we are told, are very con&s;iderable, e&s;pecially in places where the caravans &s;top. They ob&s;erve celebacy, and fa&s;t very rigorou&s;ly three quarters of the year; ab&s;taining not only from meat, but al&s;o from fi&s;h, eggs, and milk.</P>
<P>All the Armenians who apply them&s;elves to trade, which they make their chief bu&s;ine&s;s, are civil and polite, and have a great deal of good &s;en&s;e and hone&s;ty. They are not only, in a great mea&s;ure, ma&s;ters of the trade of the Levant, but have al&s;o a great &s;hare in that of the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable towns in Europe; for it is very common to meet with Armenians at Leghorn and Venice, in England, and in Holland: whil&s;t, on the other &s;ide, they travel into the dominions of the Great Mogul, Siam, Java, the Philippine i&s;lands, and over all the Ea&s;t, except China. Their genius and capacity for trade, however, did but very little appear, till their tran&s;migration into Per&s;ia, under &s;hah Abas the Great; and tho' they are now perhaps the greate&s;t traders in the world, and Armenia is very conve|niently &s;ituated for traffic upon the great rivers Tigris, Euphrates, Araxes, &amp;c. yet we find no mention of any commerce carried on by them in antient times. Now they di&s;tribute through the whole world the fine&s;t and riche&s;t commodities of A&s;ia. For a very moderate profit, they will un|dertake to conduct the merchandizes to the very places they are de&s;igned for, to take care of them during the march of the caravans, to di&s;po&s;e of them to the be&s;t advantage they can, and to give after|wards
<PB N="338" REF="3400">
a faithful account to tho&s;e by whom they are employed. It cannot be &s;ufficiently expre&s;&s;ed how faithful tho&s;e agents are, what care they take to pre&s;erve the merchandizes they conduct, not he&s;i|tating even to run the danger of peri&s;hing them|&s;elves in order to &s;uccour the camels, and other bea&s;ts of burthen that carry them, at the cro&s;&s;ing of rivers, or at the difficult pa&s;&s;es of mountains. Their charity for each other is un&s;peakable; &s;o that when tho&s;e, who are &s;ettled in &s;ome town, are acquainted with the coming of a caravan, they do not &s;cruple to undertake a journey of a day or two, in order to go and meet them, and carry refre&s;h|ments to them. When the caravans make any &s;tay in towns, in order to live the cheaper, &s;everal of them me&s;s together. In A&s;ia they &s;ell, upon the roads, hardwares of Venice, France, Germany, and England, in order to get provi&s;ions, which they procure in Europe, by &s;elling mu&s;k and &s;ome &s;pice. In a word, there is no nation comparable to them for &s;obriety, frugality, and hone&s;ty; whence it is extremely rare to &s;ee an Armenian become a bankrupt. There is nothing more extraordinary, and at the &s;ame time more plea&s;ant, than the man|ner of &s;triking bargains among the Armenians. They begin with putting money upon the table; after which they cavil, or di&s;pute, as much as they can, about the price; the buyer and &s;eller pre&s;ent|ing and repul&s;ing, alternately, the pieces of money, which they add to the price offered, or abate from the price demanded; and this is always done with &s;o much noi&s;e, and &s;uch appearance of ill humour, that one would think they were going to devour one another; but all this is nothing more than grimace and affectation; and when the broker, who is always pre&s;ent at this comedy, judges that things are pretty near their value, he &s;queezes the
<PB N="339" REF="3410">
&s;ellers hands with &s;o much violence, that he makes him cry out, and does not let him go, till he has accepted the buyer's offer.</P>
<P>Armenia is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been fir&s;t peopled by the immediate de&s;cendants of Noah, as it was upon &s;ome of the lofty mountains in this country, that the ark is believed to have re&s;ted. It after|wards became a kingdom, and continued &s;o, except while it was &s;ubject to the Per&s;ians, and the imme|diate &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Alexander the Great, till at la&s;t it became a Roman province. About the year 687 it was &s;ubdued by the Saracens, who held it till it was wre&s;ted from them by the Tartars, Turks or Turkomans, from whom it had the name of Tur|comania, and who pouring out in &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;warms from about the Ea&s;tern &s;hores of the Ca&s;pian Sea, and the country called Turke&s;tan, at la&s;t made tho&s;e great conque&s;ts, and founded that va&s;t em|pire, of which they are now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Turki&s;h inhabitants of Armenia, tho' inferior in number to the chri&s;tians, are po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome of the faire&s;t provinces on each &s;ide of the Euphrates; but in&s;tead of being ab&s;olute ma&s;ters, as they were formerly, they are now tri|butary to the Ottoman Porte, enjoying &s;ome &s;ha|dow of liberty under it. They &s;till adhere to their ancient way of living in tents, and &s;hifting their habitations from one place to another. They are tall and &s;tout, of a &s;warthy complexion, flat no&s;es, &s;quare faces; but their women are generally very hand&s;ome, and well &s;haped. They are governed by their own chiefs and laws, and profe&s;s the Mo|hammedan religion; but do not trouble them&s;elves much about the ob&s;ervance of it. Being naturally addicted to plunder, they would do a great deal of mi&s;chief to commerce, were it not for the care that the Turki&s;h ba&s;has take to keep them in order;
<PB N="340" REF="3420">
for, as the tribute paid by the caravans and the pa&s;&s;engers, make the mo&s;t con&s;iderable branch of their income, it is their intere&s;t to pre&s;erve the roads as free and &s;afe as they can. In other re|&s;pects they wink at many irregularities in their way of life, as their frequent inroads upon the Curdes, the Arabs, and other neighbouring na|tions, that own no &s;ubjection to the Porte.</P>
<P>The principal cities of this country are Erze|rum, Tocat, Van or Wan, Kars-Irvan, Zulpha, and Nack&s;ivan.</P>
<P>Erzerum, the capital, is a large city, &s;ituated in a delightful plain, near the &s;pring-head of the Eu|phrates, about five days journey from the Black Sea, and ten from the frontiers of Per&s;ia, on the northern extremity of the province, and the con|fines of Georgia. It is the &s;eat of a ba&s;ha, and has a ca&s;tle and a good garri&s;on of janizaries, under an aga.</P>
<P>There are about eighteen thou&s;and Turks in it, mo&s;t of them janizaries, or &s;uch as have purcha&s;ed of the ba&s;ha the name and privileges of janizaries, that is a liberty of committing all kinds of di&s;orders with impunity. The pay of the janizaries, from the Porte, is from five to twenty a&s;pers per day, the value of an a&s;per being about a halfpenny. The number of Armenians here is about &s;even or eight hundred, and that of the Greeks four or five hun|dred. The former have a bi&s;hop, two churches, and &s;everal mona&s;teries, under the patriarch of Er|ivan. A great trade is carried on in Erzerum in bra&s;s and copper ware, the ore of which is found in the neighbouring hills; in fine furs, particularly &s;ables; gall-nuts, caviare, madder, &s;ilk, yellow and red leather, and printed calicoes. This city is al|&s;o a great thorough fair, and a repo&s;itory for all merchandizes that come from the Ea&s;t Indies, par|ticularly
<PB N="341" REF="3430">
&s;ilks, cottons, painted cloths, rhubarb, worm&s;eed, and other drugs. Mo&s;t of the rhubarb is brought from U&s;beck Tartary. Of all the&s;e goods, much the greater part is conveyed from hence to Trebizonde on the Black Sea, in order to be tran&s;ported to Con&s;tantinople. Under the ba&s;ha of Erzerum, are &s;everal inferior ba&s;has, and nine &s;angiacks. Every one that goes from hence to Per&s;ia, except Turks, pays a capitation of five crowns, be&s;ides five per cent. for all the money he carries. They likewi&s;e exact five crowns from every &s;tranger that comes into the town, or even more, according to his &s;uppo&s;ed ability. As to the merchandize, they pay here nine per cent. three of which goes to the beglerbeg, and &s;ix to the Grand Signior.</P>
<P>The country about Erzerum is very fertile in corn, but produces no good wine. Tho' the winters here are long and &s;evere, there is &s;o great a &s;carcity of fewel, that the poor people are forced to burn cow dung. The &s;ummers are &s;hort, but &s;o exceeding hot, that the barley is ripe in about four weeks after it is &s;own, and the wheat in about two months. They water the ground by channels, cut on purpo&s;e, and plough with two yoke of oxen or buffaloes. About Erzerum grow va&s;t quanti|ties of poppies, out of which the Turks extract their opium. The caveare &s;old here, is made of the &s;pawn of &s;turgeon brought from the Ca&s;pian Sea; but is &s;aid to be far &s;hort of that made upon the &s;hores of the Baltic. The lat. of this city is 40&deg;. north, and the long. 41&deg;. 15&prime;. ea&s;t.</P>
<P>Van, or Wan, is a large city, at the north-ea&s;t end of the lake of its name, which is one of the large&s;t in A&s;ia, being computed to be about one hundred and fifty miles in compa&s;s, and abounds with a kind of fi&s;h not unlike our pilchards, of which great quantities are caught and cured, and
<PB N="342" REF="3440">
&s;ent abroad, as well as con&s;umed at home. On the top of a high craggy mountain, near the town, is a ca&s;tle, which commands the town and adjacent country, and has a good garri&s;on.</P>
<P>Kars, or Cars, by the Turks called Agem, &s;tands on an eminence, and is about half as big as Er|zerum. A river runs hard by it thro' a deep craggy valley, and at length falls into the Araxes. The town is but a poor mean place, built mo&s;tly of timber, and thinly inhabited. The ba&s;&s;a of Cars is &s;ubject to the governor or ba&s;&s;a of Er|zerum. Kars &s;tands in lat. 40&deg;. and ea&s;t long. 43&deg;. 20&prime;, about one hundred and five miles north of Erzerum.</P>
<P>Irvan, Erivan, or Chirvan, &s;tanding on the frontiers of Per&s;ia, often changes its ma&s;ters, and is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ometimes by the Turks, and &s;ome|times by the Per&s;ians. It is large and &s;pacious, but dirty and ill built. Two rivers run by it, and the neighbouring country produces excellent wine, corn of all &s;orts, rice, and cotton. Neither the fortifications of the town or ca&s;tle are of any great &s;trength or importance, and con&s;equently do not merit a de&s;cription; being mo&s;tly of mud, they are in greater danger from rains than artillery. Of the two rivers mentioned, one called Zengui, hath a &s;tately bridge over it of four arches. The khan, cham, or governor of Erivan, is &s;aid to rai&s;e above twenty thou&s;and tomans, or nine hun|dred thou&s;and livres upon his province or govern|ment. The &s;ame officer is obliged to &s;end to Con|&s;tantinople an account of all the caravans and am|ba&s;&s;adors that pa&s;s thro' the city.</P>
<P>Provi&s;ions are very plentiful and cheap about Erivan; the wine and fruits are excellent, and there is a great variety of game. Here is a hand|&s;ome meydan, piazza or public &s;quare, and a bazar, or place where all &s;orts of merchadize are
<PB N="343" REF="3450">
&s;old. The governor's palace too, with the pub|lic baths and caravan&s;eras, are large and &s;tately. The river Zengui, that runs by this city, i&s;&s;ues from a lake not far from it, called the lake of Er|ivan, which is about twenty-five miles in compa&s;s, and contains an i&s;land, with an Armenian mona&s;tery, the monks of which are remarkable for their au|&s;terity. Near Erivan is another Armenian mona&s;|tery, by the Turks called the three churches, be|cau&s;e there are two &s;tanding by it, be&s;ides that which belongs to the mona&s;tery. This mona&s;tery is the re&s;idence of the great patriarch of the Arme|nians, who hath under him forty-&s;even archbi|&s;hops, each of whom hath four or five &s;uffragans. The&s;e archbi&s;hops, with their &s;uffragans, live in &s;ome mona&s;tery, over which they have a juri&s;diction. The revenue of this great patriarch is &s;aid toy mount to &s;ix hundred thou&s;and crowns, ever Armenian, above the age of fifteen, being obliged to pay five-pence per annum to him; but out of this he is not only bound to di&s;tribute large &s;ums for the maintenance of the poor Armenians, but likewi&s;e to pay an annual tribute to the Porte, and other Mohammedan princes.</P>
<P>Nack&s;ivan, or Nackchivan, &s;tands about &s;even leagues from the Araxes, and is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the antient Artaxata, memorable for the battle fought near it between Lucullus and Mithridates. This city had the name of Nack&s;ivan, which &s;igni|fies the &s;tation of a &s;hip, from a notion of the Ar|menians, that the ark re&s;ted near it, and that Noah laid the foundation of it immediately after his com|ing out of the ark. There are &s;ome hand&s;ome &s;treets, bazars, caravan&s;eras, public baths, and cof|fee-hou&s;es in it; but whether the city is at pre&s;ent in the hands of the Turks or Per&s;ians, is what we cannot take upon us to affirm from any good au|thority. Nack&s;ivan &s;tands twenty-one leagues
<PB N="344" REF="3460">
&s;outh of Erivan, in lat. 39&deg;. north, ea&s;t long. 75&deg;. 55&prime;. and is under the government of a khan.</P>
<P>Zulpha, with the epithet of old, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the new, in the neighbourhood of I&s;phahan. This town &s;tands on the banks of the Araxes, on the road from Nack&s;ivan to A&s;trabat and Tauris. About &s;ix miles below the town the river begins to be navigable. It was from this town that Shah Abas carried tho&s;e Armenians whom he &s;ettled in the province of Ghilan, and at I&s;phahan, who&s;e de|&s;cendants are now &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed for the com|merce they carry on in mo&s;t parts of the world, e&s;pecially in A&s;ia and the Levant. There are &s;e|veral Armenian mona&s;teries hereabouts, the monks of which are of the Romi&s;h religion, and of the Dominican order. They &s;end yearly &s;ome young Armenians to Rome to be educated there, who are afterwards &s;ent to &s;upply the vacancies that happen in tho&s;e mona&s;teries. There are reckoned about &s;ix thou&s;and &s;ouls in the di&s;trict of Zulpha, who are Roman Catholics, and differ in nothing in their form of wor&s;hip from tho&s;e in Europe, except that they celebrate ma&s;s in Armenian, in|&s;tead of the Latin tongue. They chu&s;e their own archbi&s;hop, who is afterwards obliged to go to Rome to be confirmed by the Pope. There is no &s;mall re&s;ort, both of Chri&s;tians and Mohammedans, to one of the mona&s;teries, on account of &s;ome pre|tended relicks of St. Matthew and St. Bartholo|mew, who both, according to the monks, &s;uffered martyrdom there. Not far from Zulpha, at the foot of a high mountain, are found &s;ome <HI>medi|cinal &s;prings,</HI> famed for their virtue, e&s;pecially in curing tho&s;e that are bit <HI>by venomous creatures.</HI></P>

<P>Diarbec, or Diarbekr, or more properly Diyar|bekr, i. e. the Dukes Country, from the word diyar, a duke, and bekr, a country; in its lar|ge&s;t extent comprehends the provinces anciently called Me&s;opotamia, Chaldea, Babylonia and A&s;|&s;yria, and now tho&s;e of Diyarbekr, properly &s;o called, Yerack, Ir&acirc;k Arabi, or Eyraca Arabic, and Curde&s;tan. It extends about &s;ix hundred miles in length along the banks of the Tygris and Eu|phrates, from mount Taurus on the north, to the Per&s;ian Gulph on the &s;outh; and in breadth from three hundred to one hundred and fifty miles, be|tween Per&s;ia on the ea&s;t, and Syria and Arabia De&s;erta on the we&s;t.</P>
<P>This country lying under the fifth and &s;ixth climates, between the 30th and 38th degrees of north lat. enjoys a temperate air, being neither much incommoded with fro&s;ts, nor &s;corched with exce&s;&s;ive heat.</P>
<P>Setting a&s;ide &s;ome large de&s;arts, which are unin|habited, as yielding no &s;u&s;tenance either for man or bea&s;t, the re&s;t of the country is very fertile, pro|ducing, without much labour or culture, in great variety and abundance, grain and fruits, with &s;ilk, and the riche&s;t pa&s;ture for their numerous herds and flocks.</P>
<P>Both the celebrated rivers, called the Tigris and Euphrates, pa&s;s thro' this country, and con|tribute, in an extraordinary degree, to its beauty and fertility.</P>
<P>The former, called by Mo&s;es Hiddekel, by the Turks Tegel, and by the Arabs and Per&s;ians Dig|lat, is &s;aid to have its &s;ource in the mountains of Armenia. Pliny tells us, it had the name of Ti|gris from its rapidity, that word, according to
<PB N="346" REF="3480">
him, &s;ignifying, in the Median tongue, a dart or arrow. Not far from its &s;ource it pa&s;&s;es thro' the lake Arethu&s;a, then along part of the ridge, call|ed Mount Taurus, where &s;inking into the earth, it runs under a mountain, and ri&s;es again on the other &s;ide. An evident proof of its being the &s;ame ri|ver is, that whatever is thrown into it on one &s;ide, is brought up again on the other. From thence the Tigris runs thro' another lake called The&s;pi|tes, and often $$$ks again under ground. In one place it continues for the &s;pace of twenty-five miles under ground, when emerging, it glides along with a very rapid &s;tream&punc; Several rivers di&s;charge them&s;elves into it, as it runs between A&s;&s;yria and Me&s;opotamia; and, a few leagues below Bagh|dad, it begins to branch into two channels, one of which, running acro&s;s the country, falls into the Euphrates, and forms an i&s;land with the other branch, which, continuing its cour&s;e &s;outhwards, di&s;charges it&s;elf into the &s;ame river.</P>
<P>The Euphrates is called, by the antient Hebrews, Pharat, by the Turks Mourat, and by the Arabs El-Farat, or El-Frat; but, both by the Hebrews and Arabs it is often &s;tiled Nahar, or Nehir, the river; and is ju&s;tly e&s;teemed one of the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable rivers in A&s;ia, if not of the whole globe. It has its &s;ource in a branch of Mount Taurus, whence it &s;hapes its cour&s;e we&s;terly, acro&s;s Tur|comania or Armenia, then it bends towards the &s;outh, dividing Syria from Diyarbekr; after that it runs along the we&s;tern limits of Arabia De&s;erta, thro' the provinces of Yerack, or Media and Auxa, where it waters a great number of towns, in par|ticular that of Hella, which is above a day's journey from Babylon: from thence it moves gently along towards the city of Aria, where its waters are not only ob&s;tructed, but troubled and di&s;coloured by the violent reflux or tides of the Per&s;ian Gulph,
<PB N="347" REF="3490">
tho' above thirty leagues from it. At la&s;t it joins the Tigris near the town of Carnah, at the di&s;tance of about twenty leagues from the gulph. Its cour&s;e is, for the mo&s;t part, very gentle, thro' many fertile and delightful plains; and its banks are adorned with a con&s;tant verdure, a great number of palm and other trees growing upon them, and there are noble pa&s;ture grounds on each &s;ide of them. Its waters are e&s;teemed very whole&s;ome, and the Arabs have &s;o high an opinion of them, that they think they have the virtue of curing all manner of di&s;ea&s;es; but they contract a yellowi&s;h hue in pa&s;&s;ing thro' &s;ome of the de&s;arts, which they retain in their fall into the Per&s;ian gulph, where they may be plainly traced for &s;everal miles together. As to the river it&s;elf, it is neither very deep nor wide, compared with &s;ome others in different parts of the world, except when the wa|ters are &s;welled by the melting of the &s;nows in the mountains of Armenia.</P>
<P>The Arabs divide this river into the greater and le&s;&s;er Euphrates. The fir&s;t has its &s;pring head a|mong the Gordian mountains, and falls into the Tigris near the cities of Ambar and Felougiah. The le&s;&s;er, though its &s;tream is often the bigger of the two, takes its cour&s;e towards Yerack, or Chaldea, and after forming the mar&s;hy grounds of the Nabathean fens, di&s;charges it&s;elf into the &s;ame Tigris, at a place called Carnah, or Horn, being the horn or nook between the two conflu|ents. Be&s;ides the canal called Fo&s;&s;a Regia, and by the Syrians Nahar Malcha, or the Royal River, cut by the emperor Trajan, from the le&s;&s;er to the greater branch of the Euphrates, not only that river, but the Tigris have been divided into &s;eve|ral branches, in order to prevent inundations. Se|veral territories, notwith&s;tanding, are yearly over|flowed, particularly about the cities of Cufa and
<PB N="348" REF="3500">
Va&s;&s;eth, as tho&s;e of Egypt are by the Nile. The Tigris commonly overflows about the &s;pring time, when the &s;nows of the Armenian mountains begin to melt, and as the country of Diarbekr Proper, or Me&s;opotamia, lies between it on the ea&s;t, and the Euphrates on the we&s;t, it is &s;o effectually wa|tered, and rendered &s;o fertile and delightful, that the terre&s;trial paradi&s;e is generally &s;uppo&s;ed to have been &s;ituated in it.</P>
<P>Tho' Diarbekr, in general, is naturally a country of a very rich &s;oil, and great fertility, yet by rea&s;on of the Turki&s;h tyranny, and the indolence of the inhabitants, it is neither well peopled nor cultivated; but, being a frontier country, it is well guarded and fortified on the &s;ide towards Per&s;ia. We now proceed to give an account of the particular countries or provinces contained in Diarbekr, which, as we ob&s;erved already, are tho&s;e of Me&s;o|potamia, now Diarbekr Proper; of Chaldea or Babylonia, now Yerack Arabi; and A&s;&s;yria, now Curdi&s;tan The Turki&s;h divi&s;ion of this country, as of all the other parts of the empire, is into beg|lerbergates, or ba&s;ha&s;hips, which are &s;ubdivided into &s;angiac&s;hips, and the&s;e again into ziamets and timaroits.</P>
<P>Diarbekr Proper, or Me&s;opotamia, is bound|ed on the north by Turcomania; on the we&s;t by Syria; on the ea&s;t by Curde&s;tan; and on the &s;outh by part of Arabia De&s;erta, and Yrack Proper. It had the name of Me&s;opotamia ancient|ly from its lying between the rivers Tigris and Eu|phrates. Mo&s;es calls it Padan Aram, i. e. the fruitful Syria, a name very applicable, even at this day, to the northern part of it, where it yields corn, wine, oil, fruits, and all the nece&s;&s;aries of life in great abundance; but the &s;outhern is mo&s;tly barren and de&s;ert. This country is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the &s;eat of the terre&s;trial paradi&s;e; and here,
<PB N="349" REF="3510">
it &s;eems to be agreed, the de&s;cendants of Noah fir&s;t &s;ettled after the flood. It was from this country that Abraham came into Judea, and here it was that Na|hor the father of Rebecca lived, and Laban the un|cle of Jacob, to whom Jacob fled to avoid his bro|ther E&s;au's re&s;entment, and whom he &s;erved four|teen years, for the &s;ake of his daughter Rachel. It was formerly &s;o populous, that Ptolemy reckons no le&s;s than twenty cities in it along the Euphrates, fourteen along the Tygris, and thirty-five in the inland parts; but mo&s;t of the&s;e are now in ruins.</P>
<P>Before Abraham quitted it, it was overrun with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t idolatry, and continued in that &s;tate till after our Saviour's a&s;cen&s;ion, when it is &s;aid to have received the light of the glorious go&s;|pel from St. Thaddeus, &s;ent thither by St. Thomas, at the reque&s;t of Agbarus, king of Ede&s;&s;a. Chri|&s;tianity afterwards flouri&s;hed in this country in a mo&s;t eminent manner, till about the beginning of the &s;ixth century, when its purity was &s;ullied by the here&s;y of the Jacobites, who&s;e patriarch &s;till re&s;ides here, with a juri&s;diction over all that &s;ect in the Turki&s;h dominions.</P>
<P>Diarbekr Proper, which the Arabs call Al Gi|ezirah, i. e. the i&s;land, from its being &s;ituated be|tween two rivers, at pre&s;ent forms a beglerbergate, compri&s;ing under it twelve &s;angiac&s;hips, of which the principal towns are Rika, Diarbeck, Ourfa, Diarbekr alias Amed, Amid, Ameda, and Carah|med, the capital, &s;ituated in a delightful plain, on the banks and near the head of the Tigris, about one hundred and fifty-five miles or fifteen caravan days journey, north-ea&s;t from Aleppo, in lat. 37&deg;. 35&prime;. north, and ea&s;t long 40&deg;. 50&prime;. It is one of the riche&s;t, mo&s;t trading, &s;trong, and populous cities in all A&s;iatic Turkey. A canal cut from
<PB N="350" REF="3520">
the Tigris &s;upplies it with water, and it is adorned with &s;everal &s;tately piazzas or market places, and a large magnificent mo&s;que, formerly a chri&s;tian church. There are al&s;o many inns, on both &s;ides the river, for the caravans that go to and from Per|&s;ia; and on the road, near the town, is a chapel with a cupola, where they tell you holy Job lies buried. The territory about the city is very rich and beau|tiful; the bread, wine, and fle&s;h, excellent; the fruits exqui&s;ite, and the pigeons larger and better than any where in Europe. The city is under the government of a ba&s;ha, who is very powerful, hav|ing commonly a body of twenty thou&s;and hor&s;e under his command, for repelling the Curdes and Tartars, who always go on hor&s;eback to rob the caravans. The fair &s;ex are &s;aid to have much more liberty here, and the men, e&s;pecially the Turks, more politene&s;s and affability than is u&s;ually met with in the other cities of the empire. The num|ber of the Chri&s;tian inhabitants is computed at no le&s;s than twenty thou&s;and, Armenians, Ne&s;torians, and Jacobites, with a few of the church of Rome. The chief manufacture of the city, is the dre&s;&s;ing, tanning, and dying of goat &s;kins, commonly called Turkey leather, of which the vent is almo&s;t incre|dible in many parts of Europe and A&s;ia: be&s;ides which, there is another of dyed fine linen, and cotton cloths, which are nearly in the &s;ame reque&s;t. The waters of the Tygris are &s;aid to be of a quali|ty admirably adapted to the&s;e two branches of trade, and give the leather a finer grain and colour than any other. About a league from the town is a &s;tone bridge over the Tigris, which is al&s;o ford|able here, unle&s;s when it is &s;welled by exce&s;&s;ive rains, or melted &s;nows.</P>
<P>Muo&s;&s;ul or Mo&s;ul, the capital of another begler|bergate in this province, is &s;eated in lat. 36&deg;. 59&prime;.

north, ea&s;t long. 43&deg;. on the we&s;t bank of the Tigris, near the ruins of the ancient Nineveh, for which it has been mi&s;taken by &s;ome authors. It is a &s;pacious city, about a league in compa&s;s, &s;urrounded with &s;tately &s;tone walls, and &s;harp pointed turrets; but the number of its inhabitants is not at all an&s;werable to its extent. 'Tis pretty much frequented by merchants, e&s;pecially from Curde&s;tan, who bring hither gall-nuts, and other commodities; and a con&s;iderable trade is carried on from hence with the city of Baghdad. Caravans al&s;o, and traders often pa&s;s through it, to and from Per&s;ia. The ba&s;ha re&s;ides in the ca&s;tle, and has always a body of three thou&s;and men under his command. The territory on the other &s;ide the river is exceeding fruitful, but on the city &s;ide is mo&s;tly dry, &s;andy, and barren. The heat in Mou&s;&s;ul is &s;o exce&s;&s;ive in &s;ummer, that from two hours after &s;un|ri&s;e, till about an hour after his &s;etting, there is no going out of doors; and even then the walls of the hou&s;es feel as hot as iron at half a foot di&s;tance. There is be&s;ides a dangerous wind, called by the natives &s;amiel, which reigns, by land, from this place to Surat, and is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the ea&s;t wind mentioned by Job. It is mingled with &s;treaks of fire as &s;mall as hairs, and kills tho&s;e that breathe it, who &s;oon appear as black as a coal, and their fle&s;h comes off from the bones. Some who perceive it com|ing frequently e&s;cape, by falling flat with their faces to the ground. It is thought to proceed from &s;ul|phureous exhalations, that kindle in being agitated by the wind; for it is chiefly felt on the banks of the river, and not on the water, where tho&s;e vapours are di&s;&s;ipated by the breezes, or moi&s;t air ari&s;ing from the river. But it is not this &s;ort of wind alone, though indeed the mo&s;t dangerous of all, that in|&s;e&s;ts the inhabitants of the city and climate; the hot air is dangerous not only to the lungs and
<PB N="352" REF="3540">
blood, but to the very &s;kin, which it rai&s;es in bli&s;ters, and makes to peel off; and the eyes are &s;o af|fected by it, that travellers are obliged to wear a kind of &s;oft black crape over them, to keep the heat off; but as this is not always a &s;ufficient pre|&s;ervation, they anoint them, when they begin to be inflamed, with a mixture of &s;ugar and long pepper, &s;ifted very fine.</P>
<P>Rika or Racka, the capital of a beglerbergate, though but a mean town, &s;tands on the Euphrates, in lat. 35&deg;. 58&prime;. north, ea&s;t long. 39&deg;. 50&prime;. about one hundred and five miles &s;outh we&s;t of Diarbekr, and one hundred and &s;eventy &s;ix we&s;t of Mo&s;ul.

<P>Ourfa, Orta, or Orpha, &s;tands about &s;ixty-eight miles to the ea&s;t of the Euphrates, at the head of the river Scirtas, and ninety &s;outh-we&s;t of Diar|bekr. The inhabitants pretend, that it was the place where Abraham dwelt, and where the antient city of Ede&s;&s;a &s;tood. The town is pretty large, but meanly built. Its manufactures are tape&s;try of various &s;orts, and yellow Turky leather. In our Saviour's time it was &s;ubject to its own prince, named Agbarus. The ba&s;&s;a, who re&s;ides here, has one hundred and fifty janizaries, and &s;ix hun|dred &s;pahis under his command, to keep the plun|dering Arabs in awe.</P>

<HEAD>EYRACA ARABIC, or IRAK-ARABI.</HEAD>
<P>Eyraca Arabic, Yerack, or Ir&acirc;ck Arabi, an&s;wer|ing to the antient Shinar, or Shinnar, Babylonia, or Chaldaea, lies between 30 and 40 degrees of north latitude, and is bounded on the ea&s;t by Su&s;iana, or Kh&ucirc;ze&s;t&acirc;n, and the mountainous re|gion, comprehending part of Media, A&s;&s;yria, &amp;c. on the north, by part of Me&s;opotamia, or Diyar Becr, &amp;c. on the we&s;t, by the de&s;arts of Sh&acirc;m, or Syria, and the &s;olitudes denominated from it, the de&s;arts of Ir&acirc;k, &amp;c. and, on the &s;outh, by the la&s;t de&s;arts, and part of Arabia De&s;erta, or the province of Najd. It has the epithet of Arabi to di&s;tingui&s;h it from Ir&acirc;k Agemii in Per&s;ia.</P>
<P>The name of Babylonia is univer&s;ally &s;uppo&s;ed to have been derived from that of the tower of Ba|bel, and the name of Chaldaea from the Chaldaeans, or Cha&s;dim. As for the Etymon of Ir&acirc;k, it is un|certain. By Babylonia and Chaldaea, in antient au|thors, is &s;ometimes meant, the whole of this country; and &s;ometimes only certain parts of it, namely by the fir&s;t, the territory in the neighbourhood of Baby|lon, and by the &s;econd, that which extends &s;outh|ward to the Per&s;ian gulph.</P>
<P>This country enjoys an air very temperate and whole&s;ome for the mo&s;t part, tho', at certain &s;ea&s;ons
<PB N="354" REF="3560">
of the year, no air can po&s;&s;ibly be more dangerous. The heats are then &s;o extraordinary here, that the richer &s;ort u&s;ed formerly to &s;leep in tubs and ci&s;terns of water, nor could they bear to live without this pernicious practice, which &s;till continues, as is well known to all, who have travelled into tho&s;e parts: at certain &s;ea&s;ons this country is expo&s;ed to the pe&s;tilential wind, mentioned in our de&s;crip|tion of Mo&s;ul, and much talked of by modern travellers. It &s;eldom or never rains here during cer|tain months of the year; &s;o that the inhabitants in the northernmo&s;t parts, and generally all over it, are at great labour and pains in watering their lands, the engines and wheels, which they make u&s;e of for that purpo&s;e, being &s;o numerous, e&s;pecially along the banks of the Euphrates, as &s;ometimes to hurt the navigation of the river. This drought commonly continues eight months of the year, nay it has been &s;ometimes known not to have rained for two years and a half together; and the inhabitants reckon, that if it does but rain twice or thrice in the year, it is enough for their purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>This is remarked by Herodotus, who &s;ays, that in the land of the A&s;&s;yrians it &s;eldom rained, and that tho' the country was quite like Egypt, its fertility was not cau&s;ed by the inundations of the river, as in that country, but by the painful labour of the inhabitants, who either actually watered it by hand, or dug trenches and other conveyances of that kind for its refre&s;hment and foecundation; tho' the &s;ame &s;ort of labour is nece&s;&s;ary even in Egypt. The &s;oil being rich, the climate, in general, excellent, and the indu&s;try of the inhabitants what it ought to be; this country u&s;ed formerly to vie with any other &s;pot on the face of the earth. We have &s;een it compared to Egypt as above; and the &s;outhernmo&s;t parts of it, between the rivers,
<PB N="355" REF="3570">
may be particularly compared with the Delta of that country, it being like that made up of end|le&s;s i&s;lands, &s;ome formed by nature, and &s;ome by art; and is, be&s;ides, almo&s;t under the &s;ame paral|lel of latitude; nor is the other part of it, Chal|dea, properly &s;o called, between the Euphrates and the mountains of Babylon, as they are commonly termed, much le&s;s watered by rivers, or by ca|nals, lakes or re&s;ervoirs, &s;upplied from the Eu|phrates. Hence, together with the excellence of the &s;oil, its fertility was &s;uch, that it appeared in|credible to tho&s;e, who had not been eye-witne&s;&s;es of it, yielding of grain commonly two hundred fold, and &s;ometimes three hundred, together with great numbers of palms, chiefly tho&s;e of the Date|kind; which, as Herodotus expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf, af|forded the inhabitants meat, wine and honey; tho' the vine, the olive, and the fig-tree, were what this, otherwi&s;e happy country, could not boa&s;t of, no more than her &s;i&s;ter Egypt. But for grain it equalled, if not exceeded, every other land; the mil|let and the &s;e&s;ame &s;hot up here to the &s;ize of trees, and the leaves of the barley and the wheat were u&s;ual|ly four good fingers broad. The &s;e&s;ame afforded them oil, in&s;tead of the olive, and the palm, wine, in&s;tead of the grape.</P>
<P>All this fertility mu&s;t have been greatly owing to the rivers Tigris and Euphrates, which, in the months of June, July, and Augu&s;t, overflowing their banks, laid the country under water; the &s;now in the&s;e months melting in great quantities on the mountains of Armenia; but tho&s;e inunda|tions proving very detrimental, the inhabitants guarded again&s;t them by numbers of artificial ri|vers and canals, whereby the waters were di&s;tri|buted, the country in general benefited, and an ea&s;y communication effected between the inhabi|tants. Such was the antient &s;tate of this country,
<PB N="356" REF="3580">
which would &s;till ju&s;tify the encomiums formerly be&s;towed upon it, were it properly cultivated. The pa&s;ture grounds are very rich, and breed va&s;t numbers of cattle, which furni&s;h the country with plenty of milk and butter. The Chaldees were antiently famed above all nations for their &s;kill in a&s;tronomy, and in a&s;trology, &s;ooth&s;aying, divination, and other &s;uper&s;titious practices.</P>
<P>They were al&s;o the fir&s;t, or among the fir&s;t, who introduced idolatry into the world, in the practice of which they continued till the time of the apo&s;tles, when they received the light of the ble&s;|&s;ed go&s;pel, but from which of them is uncertain. There are a variety of chri&s;tian &s;ects here &s;till, e&s;pecially Jacobites and Ne&s;torians. The &s;ect of the Jacobites took its name and ri&s;e from one Ja|cobus, &s;irnamed Syrius, becau&s;e he was a Syrian by birth. Their Patriarch, who is always called Ignatius, re&s;ides at Diarbekr in Me&s;opotamia; but has the title of Patriarch of Antioch. They are very numerous in this country and Me&s;opota|mia, allow but of one nature and will in Chri&s;t, communicate in both kinds, and reject the doc|trine of purgatory and prayers for the dead. The Ne&s;torians are &s;o denominated from Ne&s;torius, a monk of Antioch, who flouri&s;hed in the fifth cen|tury. Their patriarch re&s;ides at Mo&s;ul, and hath juri&s;diction over all their bi&s;hops in Syria, Chal|daea, India, &amp;c. They maintain that there were two per&s;ons, as well as two natures in Chri&s;t; that the Virgin Mary ought not to be &s;tiled the Mother of God, but only the mother of the &s;on of God. They communicate in both kinds, allow their prie&s;ts to marry, deny the nece&s;&s;ity of auri|cular confe&s;&s;ion, and condemn praying to cruci|fixes, images, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The language of Chaldea was antiently different from the Hebrew, which was &s;poken in Me&s;opo|tamia;
<PB N="357" REF="3590">
but by the long continuance of the Jews among them, both tongues were blended and cor|rupted, whence aro&s;e that called the Syriac, which is &s;till the language of this and the neighbour|ing provinces.</P>
<P>This country is particularly remarkable for ha|ving enclo&s;ed, according to the mo&s;t rational opi|nion, within its limits, at lea&s;t a part of Pa|radi&s;e. Here al&s;o was the great plain of Shinar, now Senj&acirc;r, where the whole race of mankind were gathered together in one body after the flood, and whence they di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves over the face of the earth. Moreover, in this country &s;tood the great and renowned city of Babylon, and the no le&s;s famous tower of Babel, of both which &s;ome remains, or what are &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;o, are &s;till &s;hewn. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable and be&s;t known towns of Chal|daea, Yerack, or Ir&acirc;k Arabi are,</P>
<P>Baghdad, the capital, &s;ituated on a delightful plain, on the ea&s;tern banks of the Tigris, towards Per&s;ia, and divided from Diarbekr, or Me&s;opo|tamia, by the &s;ame river. The foundations of it were laid in the 145 year of the Hejra, by the Khalif Al Man&s;&ucirc;r. It &s;tands in the middle of the tract comprehending the di&s;tricts of Ba&s;ra, Cufa, Wa&s;et, Maw&s;el, or Mo&s;ul, and Saw&acirc;da, and at no great di&s;tance from tho&s;e cities, nor from the rivers Euphrates and Sorat, or Shatal Arab. Some writ|ers are greatly mi&s;taken, when they make Baghdad to have occupied the &s;pot, on which the antient Ba|bylon &s;tood; for it &s;tands at no great di&s;tance from the &s;ite of the antient Sileucia and Cte&s;iphon; where|as, according to the oriental writers, the ruins of Ba|bylon lie con&s;iderably to the north of Baghdad, upon the Euphrates, near a village called Babel. The Syrians formerly called it Medinat Selama, and the Greeks Irenopolis, or the city of peace. The Arabs call it Medinat Al-Salam, or Medinat

A&s;&s;alam, Dar Al-Salam, or Dar A&s;&s;alam, which are of the &s;ame import as Irenopolis. As to the etymon of Baghdad, authors differ widely. This great city was the &s;eat of the khalifs of the hou&s;e of Al-Abb&acirc;s, excepting only two or three, from its foundation to the year of the Hejra 656, when it was taken by the Tartars or Moguls, in who&s;e hands it remained to the year of the Hejra 795, or of Chri&s;t 1392, when Timur Begh, or Tamerlane the Great took it for the fir&s;t time from Sultan Ahmed Ebn Awis, who neverthele&s;s found means to re-po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of it, till the year of the Hej|ra 803, when the city was again taken by Timur; but &s;oon after re&s;tored to the Sultan, who conti|nued &s;overeign of the place, till he was driven from thence by Meran Shah, Tamarlane's &s;on. How|ever, afterwards returning, he was cha&s;ed from thence by Kara Yu&s;et the Turkoman, in the year of the Hejra 815; who having reduced Baghdad a &s;econd time, and finally expelled from thence Abu Becr, the &s;on of Miran Shah, &s;ecured that capital to his family, which continued in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it till the time of Ha&s;&s;en, &s;irnamed U&s;un, which in Turki&s;h &s;ignifies long, commonly called by the Europeans U&s;un Ca&s;&s;an, a Turkoman prince, who drove the de&s;cendants of Kara Yu&s;et from thence, in the year of the Hejra 875, or of our Lord 1470. The princes of this family maintained them&s;elves in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of Baghdad till the year of the Hejra 914, or of Chri&s;t 1508, when Shah I&s;hmael, &s;irnamed Sufi, or Sofi, the fir&s;t prince of the royal family, that reigned in Ir&acirc;n, or Per&s;ia, till the dethroning of the late Shah Ho&s;ein, made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of it. From that time, for above an hundred years, this city continued to be a bone of contention be|tween the Turks and Per&s;ians, having been the &s;ubject of &s;everal bloody wars between tho&s;e two powerful nations. It was taken by Soliman the
<PB N="359" REF="3610">
fir&s;t, &s;irnamed the magnificent, and retaken by Shah Abbas king of Per&s;ia; but being at la&s;t be|&s;ieged by Amurath, or Morad the fourth, with a formidable army, it was finally obliged to &s;urren|der to him, in the year of Chri&s;t 1638, and has remained in the hands of the Turks ever &s;ince. There were &s;everal grand palaces, and other public buildings here formerly, built by the khalifs, and other great men, together with &s;everal colleges. It was owing to the la&s;t of the&s;e, that Baghdad, for &s;everal ages, abounded more with Mo&s;lem doctors, and other learned men, than any other place in the Mohammedan domi|nions, except Mecca and Medina. It was al&s;o extremely populous, and contained &s;everal forts or ca&s;tles, capable of making a good defence, which derived their names from their founders. The language &s;poken here was one of the mo&s;t polite and elegant dialects of the Arabic, as there was a greater concour&s;e of nobility and learned men, that excelled in many branches of literature, for &s;everal ages, in this city, than in almo&s;t any other of the ea&s;t. After what hath been &s;aid of the flouri&s;hing &s;tate of Baghdad, it will not appear &s;trange, that there &s;hould have been a mint here, in which a va&s;t number of dirh&ecirc;ms and din&acirc;rs were &s;truck.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent, this city, tho' it groans under the Turki&s;h yoke, is a celebrated empory and frontier of the Ottoman empire, on the &s;ide of Per&s;ia, to which not only many merchants, but likewi&s;e an incredible number of pa&s;&s;engers, travelling from Natolia, Syria, Pale&s;tine and Egypt into Per&s;ia, continually re&s;ort. It is the &s;eat of a ba&s;ha, to whom every one of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;engers pays a &s;ort of tribute or toll, which, in the whole, amounts to a very large annual &s;um. The religion profe&s;&s;ed here is the Mohammedan, tho' various &s;ects of
<PB N="360" REF="3620">
Chri&s;tians are tolerated, particularly Ne&s;torians, who have a church, and bear the greate&s;t &s;way. The Ja|cobites and Armenians have no place of public wor|&s;hip, but go to the convent of the Capuchins, who admini&s;ter the &s;acraments to them. There are al&s;o many Jews, who re&s;ide con&s;tantly at Baghdad, but many more who come thither annually, in order to vi&s;it the &s;epulchre of the prophet Ezekiel, which is &s;aid to &s;tand about a day and a half's journey from the city. The pacha of Baghdad is generally a vizir. The proper garri&s;on, about the middle of the la&s;t century, con&s;i&s;ted only of three hundred janizaries, commanded by an aga; tho' the pacha, who&s;e hou&s;e then &s;tood upon the banks of the river, and made a good appearance, had under his command a body of &s;ix or &s;even hundred hor&s;e. There were then al&s;o about three or four hundred &s;pahis in it, commanded by two agas, be|&s;ides another body of hor&s;e under two agas, that went under the denomination of men of courage. In fine, the Ottoman troops, at that time, in and about Baghdad, amounted to about three thou|&s;and men. The city was then one thou&s;and and five hundred paces long, &s;even or eight hundred broad, and about three miles in circumference. The walls were of brick, and &s;trengthened with towers, that re&s;embled ba&s;tions, upon which the ba&s;ha had mounted &s;ixty pieces of cannon; the large&s;t of which were not above five or &s;ix pound|ers. There were four gates, four on the land-&s;ide, and one upon the river; over which there was a bridge of thirty-three boats, or rather pieces of tim|ber, brought from Mo&s;ul, and other places, fa&s;ten|ed together on goat &s;kins, blown like bladders. The ca&s;tle or citadel was in the city, near one of the gates, called Al-Maazan, on the north &s;ide, &s;tanding partly on the river, and &s;urrounded by a &s;ingle wall, adorned with turrets; upon which
<PB N="361" REF="3630">
were planted, tho' without carriages, about one hundred and fifty pieces of cannon. The pacha was a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the civil government by a k&acirc;di, who repre&s;ented the mufti, and a tefterdar, who collected the revenues of the Grand Signior. There were five mo&s;ques, of which two were tolerably well built, and adorned with domes, covered with varni&s;hed tiles of different colours; ten caravan&s;e|ra's or inns, two of which were proper enough for the reception of travellers; and &s;everal bazars or market places, arched, to enable the merchants to bear the heats, and watered three or four times a|day for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. Commerce then flouri&s;h|ed to a con&s;iderable degree here, tho' not &s;o much as when the city was in the hands of the Per&s;ians; &s;ultan Amurath, the fourth, upon his making him&s;elf ma&s;ter of it, having put mo&s;t of the riche&s;t merchants &s;ettled there to death. Many of the Shiites, or followers of Ali, were &s;ettled there, be|ing &s;o &s;imple, as to believe, that their great im&acirc;m lived at Baghdad. The pilgrims that vi&s;it Mecca, by land, are obliged to pa&s;s thro' Baghdad; and every one of them pays a tribute or toll, equivalent to four pia&s;tres, to the pacha; which branch of the revenue brings annually a very con&s;iderable &s;um into the coffers of the Grand Signior.</P>
<P>Tavernier informs us, that the Rafedi's, or Here|tics, who &s;eem to have been a branch of the Shiites, were &s;o &s;trict and rigid, that they would by no means either eat or drink with a Chri&s;tian, and &s;carce with a Sonnite him&s;elf. In his time, he tells us, the number of the inhabitants amounted to about fifteen thou&s;and. The latitude of this city is &s;aid by mo&s;t modern geographers to be 33&deg;. 15&prime;.</P>

The married women are allowed to go to the baths, to wa&s;h and perfume them&s;elves, on Wedne&s;day morning; becau&s;e their hu&s;bands are, by their law, obliged to lie with them on Thur&s;day and Fri|day night. They &s;ometimes al&s;o get leave to vi&s;it their near relations; but are then &s;o muffled up, that no one can know them in the &s;treets. On Thur&s;day, both the married and unmarried are per|mitted to go to the &s;epulchres, to pray for the dead. They u&s;e a great many &s;trange ridiculous ceremo|nies here, at their funerals; which we have not room to de&s;cribe, nor indeed do they merit it.</P>
<P>The ruins of the once famous city of Babylon, which was &s;ixty miles in circumference, had walls eighty-&s;even feet in thickne&s;s, and three hundred and fifty in height, and was di&s;tingui&s;hed above all others by &s;ome &s;tupenduous works, as the temple of Belus, Nebuchadnezzar's palace, the hanging gardens, the banks of the river, and the artificial lakes and canals, lye on the Euphrates, near a vil|lage called Eluge, upwards of forty leagues from Baghdad. The remains are &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t only of the foundations of &s;ome great edifices, &s;cattered over the plain, of a ca&s;tle, and a va&s;t bridge over the Euphrates, which is here half a league broad.

<HEAD>CURDESTAN.</HEAD>
<P>Curde&s;tan was antiently known by the name of A&s;&s;yria, which it derived from A&s;&s;ur or A&s;hur, the &s;on of Shem, and grand&s;on of Noah. Here was founded the fir&s;t great monarchy of the world, and its proud capital Nineveh. The A&s;&s;yrian empire was at fir&s;t but of a &s;mall extent, as appears from the great number of kings Mo&s;es mentions, <HI>Gen.</HI> xiv. pa&s;&s;im, as tho&s;e of Shinar, Ela&s;&s;a, Elam, So|dom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboim, &amp;c. but it af|terwards became very large and powerful, com|prehending not only A&s;&s;yria, but Me&s;opotamia, Chaldea, A&s;ia Minor, Syria, and Pale&s;tine; and la&s;ted for the &s;pace of &s;ixteen hundred years, from Nimrod to Bellthe&s;&s;ar, or Belthe&s;hazzar, who was &s;lain by Cyrus.</P>
<P>Curde&s;tan, which &s;ignifies the country of the Curdes or Curters, who are the old inhabitants there of, lies on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the river Tigris, towards Per|&s;ia;
<PB N="364" REF="3660">
being bounded by that kingdom, on the ea&s;t, by the Tigris, on the we&s;t, by Ir&acirc;k-Arabi or the country of Baghdad, on the &s;outh, and Turcomania on the north. It is very narrow towards the &s;outh, where it &s;carce extends ninety miles in breadth; but towards the north it &s;tretches near two hundred miles, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, that is, from the 41&s;t to the 47th degree of ea&s;t longitude. As to its length, from north to &s;outh, it reaches from 35&deg; 30&prime;. to 27&deg; 20&prime;. of latitude. The mountain Co|atra divides it from Per&s;ia, on the ea&s;t; and the Tigris, on the we&s;t, from Me&s;opotamia and Chal|dea.</P>
<P>According to the account of antient authors, this country mu&s;t, in its happy time, have been a land of plenty; but has, ever &s;i$$ the fall of the empire, been declining: a misfortune which has been particularly incident to it by the very nature of its &s;ituation, which has, at different times, made it the &s;eat of war between potent empires and na|tions; and it is now become a wilderne&s;s, excepting &s;ome &s;mall tracts, that may be cultivated, about the few and incon&s;iderable towns, that &s;tand within its borders; &s;o that there is but little to be &s;aid of its productions.</P>
<P>The we&s;tern &s;kirts of this country are wa&s;hed by the Tigris, which is &s;aid by &s;ome to have derived its name from the numbers of tigers on its banks. The other rivers of le&s;s note are the Lycus, the Caprus, and the Gorgus, at almo&s;t an equal di&s;tance from each other; of which the two former are &s;uppo&s;ed to have derived their names, the one from a wolf, and the other from a goat. Accord|ing to Bochart, they are the &s;ame with the Diaba or Diava, and the Adiaba or Kaidaba; but others &s;tile them the Great and Little Zab. Hardouin thinks, the Gorgus is the Zerben of Pliny; but Bochart will have it to be the &s;ame as the Caprus.</P>

The Curdes, who inhabit this country, and &s;ome parts of Per&s;ia, are &s;uppo&s;ed to be the de&s;cendants of the antient Chaldeans, and live entirely upon plunder. They dwell in tents upon the plains, till the &s;nows oblige them to retire into their villages; and are ever upon the watch after the caravans, and other travellers, whom they plunder, &s;trip, and murder, without mercy. They &s;pread them&s;elves from Mo&s;ul quite to the Euphrates; and mo&s;t of their princes acknowledge no &s;ubjection to either Turks or Per&s;ians. As they drive great herds of cattle with them, they are continually moving from one place to another, in &s;earch of fre&s;h pa&s;|ture; and while the hu&s;bands are in que&s;t of plunder, the women look after their cattle, and make butter and chee&s;e. They call them&s;elves Je&s;ides, from Je&s;id or Je&s;us, to whom they pay a kind of veneration; but the chief object of their wor&s;hip is the devil, whom they are very fearful of offending. Their notions of Chri&s;tianity are very gro&s;s, ab&s;urd, and &s;uper&s;titious. Their drink is nothing but milk and water, and their only wea|pon a lance. The men ride on hor&s;es, which are very fleet; but the women either upon hor&s;es or oxen. Towards winter, they retire to their huts in Curde&s;tan, or on the &s;kirts of Per&s;ia and Ir&acirc;k. They had both the antient names of Carduchi or Cordueni, and the modern one of Curdes, from a branch of the famed Niphatian mountains, called Curdo, belonging to that va&s;t chain, that goes under the name of Mount Taurus.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t remarkable places in Curde&s;tan are &s;aid to be Betlis or Betilis, Arbela, Harpel, Nine|veh, Rehobo, Rhe&s;en, Van or Wan, Holwan, &amp;c. but of the&s;e &s;o little is known, with any certainty, that it would be wa&s;ting the reader's time, to pretend to de&s;cribe them.</P>

<P>In the &s;ame di&s;trict, near or upon the Tigris, and over again&s;t Mo&s;ul, &s;tood the famous and &s;o much celebrated city of Ninus, as the profane writers call it, or Nineveh, as it is &s;tiled in holy writ. It was founded by A&s;hur the &s;on of Shem, and grand|&s;on of Noah. Its extent and greatne&s;s are &s;uffi|ciently de&s;cribed by the prophet Jonah. Upon the downfal of the A&s;&s;yrian empire, it was utterly ruined by the Medes, as had been foretold by the prophet Nahum: yet, it would &s;eem, that a new city was afterwards built out of the ruins of the an|tient, which bore the &s;ame name, as had happened to Troy, and other cities without number. At a &s;mall di&s;tance from its ruins, on a hill, is a Turki&s;h mo&s;que, over the place, where they pretend the prophet Jonas was buried. His tomb is al|ways covered with a rich carpet, and &s;ome tapers and lamps are continually burning over it, by the light of which two Turki&s;h prie&s;ts keep read|ing the alcoran; on which account, the mo&s;que is much frequented by the Turks and Per&s;ians, &amp;c. but no Chri&s;tians are &s;uffered to enter it, without paying a certain caphar or toll.</P>
<P>Between Nineveh and Baghdad are &s;everal re|markable places, as, 1. Several hills of &s;ulphur, to which Thevenot a&s;cribes the de&s;tructive quality of the &s;amiel, or hot winds: 2. The hot &s;ulphureous baths, at the village Alchamam, about a day's jour|ney

<P>Between Nineveh and Baghdad grow al&s;o plenty of tamari&s;ks, liquorice, and &s;umach. The la&s;t being infu&s;ed in water, renders it &s;weet, cooling, and whole&s;ome, e&s;pecially if mixed with &s;alt, and of a red colour. They al&s;o u&s;e it in broth, again&s;t the bloody flux. The&s;e parts are greatly infe&s;ted with wild bea&s;ts, &s;uch as lions, jackalls, and ceracoulacks, which la&s;t re&s;emble large cats, but have black ears, half a foot long.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that the lions will often &s;wim to the boats on the river, and endeavour to pull the pa&s;|&s;engers out of them; who, on that account, go well armed, and keep con&s;tantly firing, till they are pa&s;t tho&s;e places.</P>

<HEAD>ANATOLIA, or ASIA-MINOR.</HEAD>
<P>This country had the name of Anatolia, on ac|count of its ea&s;tern &s;ituation in re&s;pect of Europe, and, on the &s;ame account was, and is &s;till, called the Levant. It is al&s;o frequently &s;tiled the Le&s;&s;er A|&s;ia, or A&s;ia Minor, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the whole A&s;iatic continent. Antiently it had the name of A&s;ia &s;imply, and by way of excellency, as being the fine&s;t &s;pot in all this part of the world, and adorned then with many noble and opulent cities, and con&s;iderable &s;tates.</P>
<P>It is a large penin&s;ula, bounded on the north by the Euxine Sea, which the Turks call Kara Deng|hi; on the we&s;t, and north-we&s;t, by the Archipe|lago, the Helle&s;pont, the Sea of Marmora or the Propontis, and the Thracian Bo&s;phorus or Strait of Con&s;tantinople; and on the &s;outh, by the Levant Sea, Syria, and the Euphrates. It lies between the 27th and 40th degrees of ea&s;t longitude, and be|tween the 37th and 41&deg;. 30&prime;. of north latitude; ex|tending
<PB N="368" REF="3700">
in length, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, about &s;ix hundred miles; and in breadth, from north to &s;outh, about three hundred and twenty. Modern geographers divide it into Anatolia, properly &s;o called, Ama&s;ia, Aludulia, and Caramania; which contained an|tiently the provinces of Galatia, Paphlagonia, Bi|thynia, Pontus, My&s;ia, Phrygia, Lydia, Maeonia, Aeolis, Jonia, Caria, Doris, Pamphilia, Pi&s;idia, Cappadocia, Lycia, Lycaonia, and Cilicia. Ana|tolia or Natolia, at pre&s;ent, is under the govern|ment of the beiglerbeg or viceroy of Natolia; &s;ubordinate to whom are &s;everal ba&s;haws, and a great number of &s;angiacs.</P>
<P>Anatolia enjoys a temperate air. The inhabi|tants are not much incommoded with cold fro&s;ty weather, nor &s;corched with exce&s;&s;ive heat: and the air would be undoubtedly much better than it is, were the lands duly cultivated; but though natu|rally rich, fertile, and well watered, they are now little better than a de&s;ert, neglected and over-run with weeds, brambles, briars, and thorns. The few plains and dales that are cultivated, though on|ly in the Turki&s;h manner, that is very imperfect|ly, do yet yield corn of &s;everal &s;orts, exqui&s;ite grapes and wines, olives, citrons, lemons, oranges, figs, dates, &amp;c. be&s;ides abundance of coffee, rhubarb, bal&s;am, opium, galls, and other valuable drugs and gums. Natolia is well watered with rivers; &s;ome of which fall into the Mediterranean, &s;ome into the Archipelago, and others into the Eu|phrates or Black Sea. Among them are tho&s;e an|tiently celebrated rivers, Xanthus, Cydnus, Maean|der, Granicus, Cay&s;ter, Scamander, Hermus, Pac|tolus, and Caicus. There are al&s;o &s;ome con&s;idera|ble lakes in this country; one in particular, called by the Turks, Guol-Bug-Shaw, which is about fif|ty miles in length, and twenty-two in breadth.</P>

The Turks are generally above applying them|&s;elves to trade and manufactures; the&s;e here, as in Turky in Europe, are chiefly managed by their Chri&s;tian &s;ubjects, and Jews. The principal ma|nufactures are, carpets, cottons, tape&s;tries, leather, and &s;oap, of which, together with &s;ilk, grogram yarn, goats-hair, dying &s;tuffs, rhubarb, fruit, and oil, large quantities are exported to Europe, and el&s;ewhere. This country, as well as Turky in Eu|rope, is admirably &s;ituated for traffic, having the navigation of the Black Sea, Archipelago, and Me|dit&eacute;rranean, and the rivers, that fall into them; but the Turks never mind commerce, and let every+thing run to ruin: they never attempt di&s;tant voyages, and have but very few merchant-&s;hips; both their imports and exports being made in fo|reign bottoms.</P>
<P>The religions here are the &s;ame as in Turky in Europe; Jews and Chri&s;tians of all denominations, are tolerated, but much oppre&s;&s;ed, e&s;pecially the lat|ter. Mohammedi&s;m is the dominant religion; and the di&s;ciples of that alone are encouraged and re|warded. The Greeks, Armenians, and Ne&s;torians, have their patriarchs, archbi&s;hops, and bi&s;hops, &amp;c. here; and there are al&s;o &s;ome titular popi&s;h bi&s;hops. The only &s;eminaries for learning, in all this va&s;t country, are a few Greek and Armenian &s;chools, where children learn to read, and perhaps to write; and &s;ome academies, if they de&s;erve that name, erected by Je&s;uits, or other orders of the church of Rome. The clergy of all denominations are very ignorant.</P>
<P>The chief languages &s;poken in this country are the Turki&s;h, modern Greek, and Armenian; a|mong the catholics the Latin, and among the mer|chants the Lingua Franca, are al&s;o u&s;ed. The la&s;t is a jargon, compo&s;ed of &s;everal languages.</P>

<P>Of the four provinces, into which A&s;ia Minor is divided, this is the large&s;t, mo&s;t we&s;tern, and neare&s;t to Europe; being bounded by the Archi|pelago and Propontis on the we&s;t, by the Euxine Sea on the north, Caramania on the &s;outh, and by Ama&s;ia and Aladulia on the ea&s;t. It extends al|mo&s;t from the 26th to the 35th degree of ea&s;t long. and from the 37th to 41&deg;. 20&prime;. of north lat.</P>
<P>Under the beiglerbeg of this province are fif|teen &s;angiacs, two hundred and forty-five zaims, and &s;even thou&s;and &s;even hundred and forty ti|mars. The revenue of the beiglerbeg is &s;aid to amount to a million of a&s;pers yearly; and the troops kept in it to above &s;ixteen thou&s;and, who&s;e pay is reckoned at about thirty-&s;even millions three hundred and ten thou&s;and &s;even hundred a&s;pers per annum.</P>
<P>Anatolia contains the antient provinces of Bi|thynia, My&s;ia, the Le&s;&s;er Phrygia, Aeolis, Ionia, Caria, Doris, Lydia, Phrygia, Galatia, and Paph|lagonia.</P>
<P>Bithynia, called by the Turks Beck&s;angil, is parted from Europe only by the Thracian Bo&s;pho|rus, or Strait of Con&s;tantinople. The &s;oil, if duly cultivated, would be exceeding fruitful. There were antiently a great many large, beautiful, and opulent cities in this country; but the only ones worth mentioning at pre&s;ent are,</P>
<P>Pru&s;a, by the Turks called Bur&s;a, antiently a ve|ry noble city, and the capital of Bithynia. It &s;tands at the foot of Mount Olympus, twenty miles from
<PB N="371" REF="3730">
the Sea of Marmora, and fifty-eight almo&s;t &s;outh of Con&s;tantinople. It is &s;till a well-built town, and better paved than mo&s;t in this country. Here are &s;ome fine mo&s;ques and caravan&s;eras. That called the Royal Mo&s;que is a very &s;tately &s;tructure, and contains the tombs of the antient Turki&s;h kings; this city having been the &s;eat of tho&s;e monarchs, till the taking of Con&s;tantinople by Mohammed IV. A caravan goes from hence, every two months, to Per&s;ia; and &s;everal others pa&s;s through it, in their way to that country, from Con&s;tantinople, Aleppo, &amp;c. The beze&s;tine here is a large edi|fice, and all &s;orts of merchandize are expo&s;ed to &s;ale in it. The &s;eraglio, built by Mohammed IV. is &s;aid to be a noble &s;tructure, and plea&s;antly &s;itu|ated. The mu&s;&s;elmen live all within the walls; and the Jews, Greeks, Armenians, &amp;c. in the &s;uburbs. There are &s;ome hot baths here, highly commended for their medicinal virtues. The city is governed by a ba&s;&s;a, a cadi, or moula, and a jani|zary aga, who hath about two hundred and thirty janizaries under him. The antient Pru&s;a is thought to have been built and named from the famous Pru&s;ias, king of Bithynia, who waged war again&s;t Croe&s;us and Cyrus. Notwith&s;tanding this antiqui|ty, the only antient remains are the marble tombs of the famed Orcan, his wife, and children, which are in one of the mo&s;ques. Here are manufactures of &s;ilks, hangings, tape&s;try, carpets, &amp;c. for weav|ing of which the Pru&s;an workmen are allowed to be the be&s;t in all Turky.</P>
<P>Nice, by the Turks called I&s;nich and Nichor, and in Latin Nicaea, &s;tands about thirty miles &s;outh-ea&s;t of Con&s;tantinople, near a gulph of the &s;ea of Marmora, called the lake of A&s;cu, or A&s;canio. Though much fallen from its antient grandeur, it is &s;till a large place, and contains about ten thou&s;and inhabitants, Greeks, Armenians, Jews,
<PB N="372" REF="3740">
and Turks, who all drive a con&s;iderable commerce in corn, fruit, fine cloth, tape&s;try, and merchan|dize brought hither from the Levant. In the highe&s;t part of the town is a &s;eraglio. The neigh|bouring country produces excellent grapes and other fruits. The fir&s;t general council, convened by Con&s;tantine the Great, again&s;t the Arian here&s;y, was held here. Ly&s;imachus gave it the name of Nicaea from that of his wife, daughter of Anti|pater.</P>
<P>Nicomedia, &s;o called from Nicomedes, king of Bithynia, who enlarged and beautified it, and made it his metropolis and re&s;idence. It is now called I&s;mia, and I&s;migimid by the Turks, and is a large, well built, populous city, &s;ituated at the farther end of the gulph of its own name, forty miles north-ea&s;t from Bur&s;a. No city in the whole Turki&s;h empire, it is &s;aid, comes up to it in point of &s;ituation, except Con&s;tantinople. It is computed to contain thirty thou&s;and inhabitants, Turks, Greeks, Jews, and Armenians, who carry on a great trade, and have manufactures of &s;ilks, cot|tons, woollen and linen cloths, earthen-ware, and gla&s;s of all &s;orts. Here are al&s;o great numbers of &s;aicks and barks, built for the merchants, not only of this city, but al&s;o of Con&s;tantinople. Cu|rious antient in&s;criptions, both in Greek and Latin, are &s;till to be met with in many parts of the city. A little we&s;t of it is a fountain of mineral water, much cried up for its medicinal qualities, and a little further on, is a mole, ten or twelve yards in breadth, and a quarter of a league in length, &s;up|po&s;ed to have been erected with a view to &s;helter the &s;hips in the harbour. The gulph, to which this city gives name, is not above a mile and a half in breadth; but very long and deep.</P>
<P>Chalcedon, once a famed and flouri&s;hing city, is now dwindled into a village, with &s;ome broken
<PB N="373" REF="3750">
remains of its antient &s;plendor. It is &s;ituated on the i&s;thmus of a penin&s;ula, about &s;eventeen miles ea&s;t from Con&s;tantinople, on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore of the Bo&s;phorus, and has a harbour. The river Chalcedon runs on the ea&s;t of it. This town was the &s;eat of the fourth general council, and is &s;aid to have had antiently a temple of Venus, and an oracle of Apollo in it.</P>
<P>Lebu&s;a, antiently called Liby&s;&s;a, and noted for the death of Hannibal, from an opulent city, is now dwindled into a village, &s;tanding half way between Nicomedia and Chalcedon.</P>

<HEAD>MYSIA and the LESSER PHRYGIA.</HEAD>
<P>The&s;e two provinces, which we have joined toge|ther, as not knowing the exact limits by which they are parted, are bounded on the north, by the Pro|pontis; on the &s;outh, by Lydia and the Archipe|lago; on the we&s;t, by the Helle&s;pont; and on the ea&s;t, by Phrygia Major. In this country are the two famed mountains of Olympus, or rather a part of the two chains or ridges of mountains that go under that name. Mr. Tournefort tells us, that the tops of them were covered with &s;now when he &s;aw them, and the &s;ides with pine, and other trees; wild thyme, and other &s;hrubs, particularly the Cretan or Laudanum Ci&s;tos, with broad leaves. The mountains, that form the chain of Ida, are &s;aid to be the highe&s;t in this part of the world, e&s;pe|cially that in the center, which is the mountain, properly called Ida. One thing very remarkable in re&s;pect to it is, that about the beginning of the dog|days, the air is perfectly &s;erene, and &s;o &s;till on it, that one cannot perceive the lea&s;t breath of wind &s;tirring. In the night one &s;ees the &s;un's rays dart|ing all round the horizon, which makes it appear as if it was on fire; but this goes off, in propor|tion
<PB N="374" REF="3760">
as the &s;un draws nearer to its ri&s;ing. Among the many rivers that have their &s;ources in it, are the Granicus, and Ae&s;opus, which fall into the Pro|pontis; and the Simois, and Xanthus, which di&s;|charge them&s;elves into the Helle&s;pont. The river Caicus, called by the Turks Girma&s;ti, with the Cay&s;ter and Pergamus, pa&s;s al&s;o through My&s;ia, which contains the following places, viz.</P>
<P>Cyzicus, Cyzicum, now Chizico, Spiga, Spinga, and Patorma, which tho' antiently a fine city, is at pre&s;ent but an ordinary town, &s;tanding on the &s;outh-ea&s;t coa&s;t of the Propontis, or &s;ea of Mar|mora, about eighty miles almo&s;t we&s;t of Bur&s;a. There are &s;everal i&s;lands in the Propontis over|again&s;t this town, which abound with corn, wine, fruits, cotton, and cattle. They have the general name of Marmara, or Marmora, i. e. the Marble I&s;lands, from the marble quarries in them; from which the Propontis is al&s;o called the Sea of Marmora.</P>
<P>Lamp&s;acus, now Lamp&s;aco, which hath lo&s;t much of its antient &s;plendor, being but a &s;mall city, inha|bited by a few Turks and Greeks. It &s;tands at the mouth of the Helle&s;pont, over-again&s;t Gallipoli in Europe, and has a good convenient port. The neighbouring country abounds with vines and pomegranates; the former of which, even the Turks them&s;elves, cultivate here, making good wine and brandy to mix with their &s;herbet.</P>
<P>Abydos, though antiently a famous city, is now a paultry place at the mouth of the Helle&s;pont, called Avido or Avio, where the Turks have a ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>In the Le&s;&s;er Phrygia, the places worth men|tioning are,</P>
<P>Troy, or rather the ruins of Troy, which are &s;till to be &s;een on the river Scamander or Xan|thus, a few miles from the coa&s;t of the Aegean &s;ea or Archipelago. But whether the&s;e remains,
<PB N="375" REF="3770">
which extend a great way, and con&s;i&s;t of fragments of marble tombs, columns, aqueducts, temples, palaces, arches, &amp;c. are tho&s;e of that Troy which was de&s;troyed after a ten years &s;iege by the Greeks, or of Troas Alexandria, founded by Alexander the Great, and rebuilt by Ly&s;imachus, the learned are not agreed.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;os, antiently a &s;trong &s;ea-port town on the &s;outh coa&s;t of the Le&s;&s;er Phrygia, now a mean village.</P>
<P>Antandros, now St. Dimitri, &s;tanding on the &s;ame coa&s;t, but farther ea&s;t, at the foot of Mount Ida. It was antiently a con&s;iderable city, but is at pre&s;ent quite decayed.</P>
<P>Adramyttum, by the Turks called Endromit, &s;tanding towards the mouth of the gulph to which it gives name, and which lies over again&s;t the i&s;land of Le&s;bos. This place is mentioned in the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, and &s;eems to have been antiently a good town and port, but is now of no account.</P>
<P>Pergamus, antiently a noble city, and the me|tropolis of a kingdom, but now dwindled to a &s;mall mean town, called Pergamo, &s;ixty miles north of Smyrna, on the banks of the Caicus. Here was one of the &s;even churches mentioned in the Revelations; here the celebrated phy&s;ician Galen was born, and that u&s;eful commodity invent|ed which we call parchment, a corruption of perga|menum, from Pergamos. There was al&s;o a &s;tately temple of E&s;culapius formerly in this town. Many antiquities are &s;till to be &s;een in and about it.</P>
<P>Eolis is bounded on the north by the Le&s;&s;er Phrygia; on the &s;outh by Ionia; on the we&s;t by the Aegean &s;ea; and on the ea&s;t by Lydia. The cities of note in it antiently were Elaea, Myrina, Cu|ma, and Phocea, all four on the Aegean &s;ea; though the la&s;t of them is placed by Mela and Pliny in Ionia. They are all now poor mean places. The
<PB N="376" REF="3780">
&s;econd is called by the Turks, Marham; and the la&s;t Foggia, or Foglia. About ten miles we&s;t of Foggia, and on the &s;ame coa&s;t, is another &s;mall but neat &s;ea-port town of the &s;ame name, with the epi|thet of Nova, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the old. All the&s;e places lie overagain&s;t the i&s;land of Le&s;bos.</P>
<P>Ionia, which lies contiguous to Eolis, contains the following places worth mentioning, on account either of their antient or pre&s;ent &s;tate.</P>
<P>Smyrna, by the Turks called I&s;myr, and one of the fine&s;t &s;ea port towns of the Levant, &s;tanding in lati|tude 38&deg;. 15&prime;. north, ea&s;t longitude 27&deg;. 10&prime;. eight days journey from Con&s;tantinople by land, and four hundred miles by water; twenty-five days jour|ney for the caravans from Aleppo, and eight from Kutahia; forty-three miles north-we&s;t from Ephe|&s;us; on the i&s;thmus of a penin&s;ula, and at the bot|tom of a gulph of the Archipelago, to which it gives name, and where the rivers Meles and Her|mus fall into it. Its advantageous &s;ituation, and commodious harbour, hath rendered it one of the riche&s;t and greate&s;t cities in Turkey. The haven is defended by a ca&s;tle, and &s;heltered by high mountains again&s;t all winds, but the we&s;terly; and even on that &s;ide there is a bank of &s;and, that breaks the force of the waves, leaving only a nar|row deep opening, by which &s;hips of the greate&s;t burden may get into the harbour, where they ride &s;afe, and at ea&s;e. Here are merchants and con&s;uls belonging to &s;everal European nations, e&s;pecially to England. The town is reckoned to contain fifteen thou&s;and Turks, ten thou&s;and Greeks, and near two thou&s;and Jews, be&s;ides Armenians, Franks, &amp;c. It lies on the &s;ide of a hill, with a full view of the &s;ea before it; and the &s;treets and hou&s;es are well built and paved, e&s;pecially that called the &s;treet of the Franks. The European merchants bring hither a great variety of European
<PB N="377" REF="3790">
and of Ea&s;t and We&s;t-India goods; and export Per&s;ian &s;ilk, mohair, cotton, fine and coar&s;e wool, wax, gall-nuts, rhubarb, opium, &s;cammony, aloes, tutty, galbanum, tacamahac, gum-tragacanth, am|moniac, and arabic, myrrh, frankincen&s;e, zedoar, ca&s;|&s;amunair, &amp;c. The trade here, as all over Turkey, is managed chiefly by the Jews. The Franks or Europeans enjoy great freedom, having their &s;eve|ral places of wor&s;hip, &s;peaking their own lan|guage, and dre&s;&s;ing and living after the fa&s;hion of their country. The great di&s;advantage of Smyrna is, that it is &s;ubject to earthquakes: the la&s;t, which happened in 1688, overthrew the greate&s;t part of the city. To guard as much as po&s;&s;ible again&s;t the ill effects of future &s;hocks, they build their hou&s;es only to the height of about ten or twelve feet of &s;tone from the foundation; and the re&s;t of wood and earth white wa&s;hed. The kaans or caravan&s;eras are here very large and well built; and the whole town one continued bazar or fair. The con&s;uls of France, England, and Holland have &s;tately hou&s;es by the &s;ea-&s;ide. In the neighbourhood of this city is a kind of fat earth, which being boiled with oil, makes excellent &s;oap. Near it al&s;o are to be &s;een the remains of an antient Roman circus, theatre, and other ruins; and in its environs are often found variety of Roman medals. About two &s;hort days journey from it are &s;ome remains of the antient city of Thyatira. This city is one of the &s;even, that contended for the honour of being the birth-place of Homer, to who&s;e memory they built a temple. It is al&s;o mentioned in the Apocalyp&s;e as the &s;eat of one of the &s;even A&s;iatic churches.</P>
<P>Clazomene, one of the twelve antient cities of A&s;ia, and the birth-place of Anaxagoras, but now a &s;mall &s;ea port on the Ionian penin&s;ula, called Urla, or Vourla.</P>
<P><PB N="378" REF="3800">
Aerythraea, formerly a con&s;iderable city, now dwindled into a village, on the Ionian coa&s;t, be|tween Clazomene and Teos, called Ge&s;me.</P>
<P>Teos, &s;aid to have been antiently a good &s;ea|port, and the birth-place of Anacreon, now an incon&s;iderable place on the &s;outh coa&s;t of the Ionian penin&s;ula.</P>
<P>Lebidus or Lebidos, one of the twelve antient cities of A&s;ia, and famed for the games celebrated there to Bacchus, but now a poor &s;ea-port near the i&s;thmus of the penin&s;ula.</P>
<P>Colophon, antiently a famous city, which laid claim to the birth of Homer, and had a celebrated temple and oracle, at pre&s;ent a poor village on the &s;ea coa&s;t, about thirty miles almo&s;t &s;outh of Smyrna.</P>
<P>Ephe&s;us, antiently a mo&s;t noble city, celebrated for its magnificent temple of Diana; for the epi&s;tle that St. Paul wrote to the Chri&s;tians in it; for being the place where the evangeli&s;t John was buried; and for its fir&s;t bi&s;hop, Timothy, appointed by St. Paul; but now, by a melan|choly rever&s;e, reduced to a poor village, con&s;i&s;t|ing of thirty or forty Greek families, called by the Greeks Efe&s;o; and by the Turks Aja&s;a|louch. Here are &s;till to be &s;een &s;ome noble ruins, e&s;pecially of an aqueduct. The famed weeping philo&s;opher, Heraclitus; and the celebrated painter, Parrha&s;ius, cotemporary with Socrates, were na|tives of this city. What remains of it, &s;tands about forty-three miles from Smyrna, near the mouth of the Cay&s;ter, and the Icarian &s;ea, which is only a gulph of the Aegean. There were an|tiently two noted cities in this country, of which no ve&s;tiges now remain, viz. Priene and Magne&s;ia. In the former Bias, one of the wi&s;e men of Greece was born; and in the latter Themi&s;tocles died in exile.</P>

Caria, which is bounded on the north by Ionia, and the river Maeander; on the &s;outh and we&s;t by the Icarian &s;ea; and on the ea&s;t by great Phry|gia and Lycia, contains no place at pre&s;ent worth mentioning, unle&s;s it is Miletum or Miletus, once one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable cities of A&s;ia, and the birth-place of the famed Thales; but now a place of little or no account, called Palat&s;$hia. It &s;tands on the &s;outh &s;ide of the Maeander, near the &s;ea-coa&s;t: &s;everal large ruins are &s;till to be &s;een about it.</P>
<P>Of the antient cities, Heraclea, and Lathinum, Boryglia, Myla&s;&s;a, Amyzon, Alabanda, Strato|nice, and Alynda, that &s;tood on the frontiers of this province, there are hardly any traces now re|maining.</P>
<P>Doris projects into the &s;ea, and is &s;urrounded by it on all &s;ides, except on the north, where it is bounded by Caria. On the &s;outh and &s;outh-we&s;t of it lie the i&s;lands of Scio or Cos, and Rhodes. The only place of any note in it at pre&s;ent is Mentes, antiently Mindus, which is the chief town in the&s;e parts, a &s;ea-port, and the &s;eat of the Turki&s;h &s;angiac of this province. Of the noble city and &s;ea-port of Halicarna&s;&s;us, antiently the metropolis of all Caria and Doris, and &s;amed for the tomb of king Mau&s;olus, erected by his queen Artemi&s;ia, and e&s;teemed one of the nine wonders of the world, there is now nothing remaining but ruins; nor of Cnidos, Cre&s;&s;a, and Ceramus, for|merly con&s;iderable cities upon the &s;ea-coa&s;t of this province.</P>
<P>Lydia, alias Maeonia, once the kingdom of the celebrated Croe&s;us, is bounded by the country an|tiently called Phrygia on the ea&s;t; the Archipelago on the we&s;t; My&s;ia on the north; and Caria on the &s;outh.

However, it has &s;till a large kaan or caravan&s;era for the convenience of the cara|vans and travellers that pa&s;s thro' it from Smyrna and Aleppo into Per&s;ia. One may form an idea of its antient &s;plendor, by the noble remains &s;till to be &s;een about it.</P>
<P>Philadelphia, antiently a large city, and the &s;eat of one of the &s;even A&s;iatic churches, is now but a middling town, containing about &s;ix or &s;even thou|&s;and inhabitants, mo&s;t of them Greeks.

<P>Ancyra, antiently a con&s;iderable city, and &s;till a populous trading place, and the re&s;idence of a &s;angiac, two hundred and fifty miles ea&s;t of Smyrna. The Turks call it Angouri. There is a manufacture here of camblets, and other &s;uch light &s;tuffs. The town retains &s;till the marks of its pri&s;trine grandeur in the many fragments of columns, architraves, freezes, &amp;c. of the fine&s;t marble, porphyry, and ja&s;per, which are yet to be &s;een in all parts of it, together with a va&s;t num|ber of in&s;criptions in &s;everal languages, as Greek, Arabic, and Turki&s;h.</P>

<P>Andres, &s;ituate a little to the ea&s;t of Ancyra; Therma, &s;o called from its hot baths; Germa&s;te, antiently Germia, on the river Sangarius; and A|phium or Aphion, a pretty good town, tho' dirty and ill-built, to the &s;outh of Kutahia. The name of Aphium was given it from the opium made in and about it, the whole adjacent territory producing great quantities of poppy, from which that excellent drug, called by the Turks aphium, or afiun, is extracted.</P>
<P>The antient cities Tabia, A&s;pona, Cinna, Re|ganagalia, Regemne&s;us, Heliopolis, Pi&s;inus, Mau|recium, Peline&s;us, Aeorium, Clancus, Regetnocade, Eudoxias, Myracion and Amorium, or Amurium, are now either in ruins, or poor mean villages.</P>
<P>Paphlagonia and Pontus, being contiguous, and interwoven with one another, are common|ly joined together. They both lie on the north of Galatia, and are divided on the ea&s;t from Cappadocia by the river Halys, famed for its &s;wift current; on the we&s;t from Metapontus, or Pontus, properly &s;o called, by the river an|tiently &s;tiled Parthenius, on account of its fine &s;treams, and beautiful land&s;kips; but now by the Turks Dulap, or Dolap. The country antiently called Pontus was of great extent, &s;treaching it&s;elf along the Euxine Sea; but this we are now upon, being but a &s;mall part of the other, and cut off from it by Paphlagonia, we thought it would be mo&s;t proper to treat of it under that province.</P>
<P>Paphlagonia was the antient &s;eat of the Heneti or Veneti, from whom the Venetians are de&s;cended. At pre&s;ent it is called, in the Turki&s;h, the country of Pender, or Bolli, Bol, Bon, and the Pontus

It &s;tands on the Euxine Sea, on the ruins of the antient Heraclea, being &s;mall and ill-built: but its walls, towers, gates, &amp;c. contain many noble fragments and &s;cantlings of the old city.

This city was once famous for being the re&s;idence of the illu&s;trious family of the Comneni, founders of the empire of Trebizonde.</P>
<P>Ama&s;tris, antiently a famous &s;ea-port, on the &s;ame coa&s;t, at the mouth of the river Parthenius, but now dwindled into a poor &s;orry town, called Ama&s;tro, &s;tanding about &s;ixty miles almo&s;t ea&s;t of Eregli.</P>

<P>Sinope, antiently the metropolis of the kingdom of Pontus, and the birth and burial-place of the great Mithridates, but at pre&s;ent is only a good trad|ing town, &s;ituate on the i&s;thmus of a penin&s;ula, that runs into the Euxine Sea, about &s;eventy miles ea&s;t of Penderachi. Here is a profitable fi&s;hery, ex|cellent water, and &s;ome noble remains of antiquity.

It hath a particular beig|lerbeg; but we have no account of the number of &s;angiacs that are under him, nor of the ziams and timars. The principal places in it are as follows, viz.</P>
<P>Ama&s;ia, the capital of the whole province, to which it al&s;o gives name, and the re&s;idence of the beiglerbeg. It is called by the Turks Amna|&s;an, and &s;tands about &s;ixty miles from the Euxine Sea, and forty ea&s;t of Tocat, on or near the river Iris, now Ca&s;almach. The city is large, but its commerce incon&s;iderable, notwith&s;tanding the ri|ver is navigable for &s;hips of great burthen up to the town.

<P>Tocat, antiently Neocae&s;area, &s;tands about forty miles ea&s;t of Ama&s;ia, and two hundred and five we&s;t of Erzerum, on the river To&s;anlu, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Lupus mentioned by Pliny, which falls into the Iris &s;ome miles below the town. Tocat is a large well-built city, containing about twenty thou&s;and Turks, be&s;ides Armenians and Greeks. It is a place of great trade, being e&s;teemed the centre of the A&s;iatic commerce. Caravans are continually pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing to and from Smyrna, Synope, Pru&s;a, Angora, &amp;c. The&s;e caravans are not only well armed, but likewi&s;e e&s;corted by Turki&s;h troops, the roads being much infe&s;ted by freebooters. Here is a Turki&s;h cadi, or judge, a wayvode, and a jani&s;&s;ary aga, who has about a thou&s;and janizaries and &s;pahis under him. Several con&s;iderable ma|nufactures are carried on in this city, particu|larly of &s;ilk &s;tuffs, yellow leather, copper, and of red linen, commonly called Levantine cloths, which are chiefly made here and at Ama&s;ia. The city is well &s;upplied with water, almo&s;t every hou&s;e having a running fountain in it. The adjacent coun|try produces a great variety of excellent plants, and &s;ome very beautiful fo&s;&s;ils. The inhabitants for thirty or forty miles about, are mo&s;tly Armenians, employed, &s;ome in agriculture, but the greater part in the iron and copper manufactures, and in tan|ning of leather. About two miles from the town are two &s;mall rooms, cut out of the &s;olid rock, and held in great veneration by the Chri&s;tians, as the &s;uppo&s;ed retreat of St. Chry&s;o&s;tom, during the time of his exile.</P>

It &s;tands about fifty-five miles &s;outh from Tocat, and &s;eventy-five &s;outh ea&s;t from Ama&s;ia.</P>
<P>Trabezonde, Trebizonde, or Trapezonde, antient|ly called Trape&s;us, and by the Turks at pre&s;ent Tara&mdash;bazan, a large town, with a ca&s;tle and &s;trong walls, near the coa&s;t of the Euxine Sea, about eighteen miles north-ea&s;t of Tocat. On the ea&s;t of it is a port or ha|ven; but it will admit only of &s;aiques or Turki&s;h barks. The town is neither well built nor well peopled; but it is the &s;eat of a Turki&s;h ba&s;&s;a, and a Greek archbi&s;hop. About twenty-five miles &s;outh-ea&s;t of it is the convent of St. John, built all of wood, on a high &s;teep rock. The neigh|bouring country is very plea&s;ant, and abounds in a kind of rock honey, &s;o rich and lu&s;cious that it can|not be eaten, unle&s;s in a &s;mall quantity, without danger. This lu&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, Mr. Tournefort a&s;cribes to the nature of the flowers from which the bees extract it.</P>
<P>Pharnacia, a large town near the coa&s;t of the Euxine Sea, about forty-four miles we&s;t of Trebi|zonde. It is thought by &s;ome to be the antient Care&s;us and Cera&s;unta; and to have been called &s;o from the great numbers of cherry-trees that grow about it. The Turks call it Keri&s;un. Its har|bour is fit only for &s;aics.</P>

Cappadocia, and the Le&s;&s;er Armenia, is called by the Turks Dulgadir, or the beglerbergate of Mu|nit or Mara&s;ch. It had the name of Anadulia, or Anadoli, from a prince who reigned in it when the Turks fir&s;t made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of it.</P>
<P>The face of this country is rough and hilly, for which rea&s;on it is unfit for tillage; but abounds in fine pa&s;ture grounds, wines, and fruits, and al&s;o in cattle, e&s;pecially hor&s;es and camels, be&s;ides va&s;t herds of &s;heep and goats. Here is likewi&s;e plenty of veni&s;on, and other game; and the mountains contain mines of &s;ilver, copper, iron, alum, &amp;c. The province is divided into four &s;angiac&s;hips, and the&s;e again into ziamets and timariots. There are numbers of banditti in this and other parts of A&s;ia Minor, who live chiefly by plundering the cara|vans and other pa&s;&s;engers. The principal places in Aladulia are the following, viz.</P>
<P>Mara&s;ch or Mars, antiently Me&s;ena and Metila, a large well-built city, on a &s;mall river which falls into the Euphrates, in the &s;outh-ea&s;t boundaries of the province, an hundred and eighty miles almo&s;t &s;outh of Trebezonde. It drives a good trade, and is the re&s;idence of the ba&s;&s;a.</P>
<P>Malathiah, a con&s;iderable town, at the confluence of the Euphrates and Ar&s;u, antiently called Meli|tene. It was formerly the &s;eat of the Ottoman princes, and now of a Greek archbi&s;hop.</P>
<P>Cai&s;ar, antiently Cae&s;area and Mazaca, a large town, &s;ituated on or near Mount Argaeus, and the north banks of the Milas, about &s;eventy miles we&s;t of Sivas. It hath &s;trong walls, flanked with towers, hand&s;ome and well &s;tored bazars, and a ca&s;tle, &s;ituated almo&s;t in the centre of the city.

<P>There were many other cities antiently in this country, as Ny&s;&s;a, Nazianzum, Tyana, &amp;c. which are now either poor villages, or heaps of ruins. Among the eminent men who have had their birth in it are, Pau&s;anias the Greek Hi&s;torian, the two Gregories of Nazianzen, St. Ba&s;il, and St. George, the patron of England.</P>

<HEAD>CARAMANIA.</HEAD>
<P>Caramania, the fourth and la&s;t province of A&s;ia Minor, extends it&s;elf, from north to &s;outh, along the Mediterranean coa&s;t; comprehending the an|tient countries of Lycia, Pamphylia, Pi&s;idia, Ly|caonia, and Cilicia, with part of I&s;auria, Phrygia Pacatiana, Galatia Salutaris, and Cappadocia; reaching from the Gulph of Macri, at the mouth of which lies the i&s;land of Rhodes, quite to the neighbourhood of Alexandretta or Cogni. The Turks call it Caraman Ili, and divide it into the Greater and Le&s;&s;er; the former lying northward of Mount Taurus, and the latter along the &s;ea|coa&s;t. The beglerbeg or governor of Caramania is &s;aid to have a revenue of &s;ix hundred and &s;ix thou&s;and and &s;eventy-four a&s;pers. Subordinate to him are &s;even zangiacs, with a great number of zaims and timars. The principal places in the province are,</P>
<P>Patara, once the metropolis of the province of Lycia, but now an incon&s;iderable town, near the mouth of the Xanthus, between the gulphs of Sa|talia and Macri.</P>
<P>Myrra or Myra, formerly a large city in Lycia, but now a poor place, not many miles from the mouth of the Limyras, and about twenty-two north ea&s;t of Patara. The Turks call it Strumita.</P>
<P><PB N="390" REF="3920">
Satalia, antiently Attalia, a con&s;iderable city in Pamphylia, at the bottom of the gulph of its name. It is divided into three parts, each of which has its own walls, and &s;trong iron gates, with &s;everal hand|&s;ome buildings, and &s;ome remains of antiquity. Here is a good trade, tho' the harbour is now only fit to receive &s;mall ve&s;&s;els. The neighbouring country is extremely delightful, being covered with citron and orange trees, very large and beautiful, and of exqui&s;ite fragrancy; but the &s;ummers are &s;o hot, that the inhabitants are then obliged to re|tire towards the mountains, where they have a cool|er air, and more &s;hade. Sataliah is the Turki&s;h name of the town.</P>

<P>Antiochia Pi&s;idiae, or Cae&s;area, antiently the me|tropolis of the province, but now a very mean place, called by the Turks, according to &s;ome, Verga&s;elli, but according to others Antachio. It lies at the foot of Mount Taurus.</P>
<P>Iconium, now Kogni or Cogni, and the metro|polis of the whole beglerbergate. It &s;tands in the antient Lycaonia, in a plea&s;ant fertile plain, near a large fre&s;h-water lake, formerly called Palus Tro|gilis, about an hundred and ten miles from the Mediterranean Sea. The city, which is &s;urround|ed with &s;trong walls, adorned with towers, and a broad ditch, is inhabited only by Turks; but there are two &s;pacious &s;uburbs, where the Jews, Greeks, and Armenians live. Here are &s;ome very large kaans or inns, for the caravans and travellers that pa&s;s through the town, with a &s;mall ca&s;tle, an antient &s;eraglio, and &s;everal &s;tately mo&s;ques.

<P>Tar&s;us, antiently the capital of Cilicia, and one of the faire&s;t, large&s;t, and be&s;t peopled towns in all the Le&s;&s;er A&s;ia, is now a poor decayed place, &s;itu|ated on the river Cydnus, &s;ix miles from its mouth, and by the Turks called Tar&s;ou, Tari&s;&s;u, and Hems. By the ruins of the old walls, it appears to have been once near twelve miles in circuit. About a mile below the town is the lake Rhegma, through which the Cydnus runs. There is a good commo|dious harbour at the mouth of the river. The great apo&s;tle St. Paul was a native of this place.</P>

<HEAD>SYRIA.</HEAD>
<P>Syria, the &s;econd grand divi&s;ion of We&s;tern A|&s;iatic Turky, was originally &s;o called from its ca|pital Tzor, or Tzur, which the Greeks, and other nations, &s;oftened into Sur and Tyre. At pre&s;ent, it is called by the Turks Sourie, and Souri&s;tan.</P>
<P>Syria, in a large &s;en&s;e, comprehends Syria, pro|perly &s;o called, Phenice or Phenicia, and Judea or Pale&s;tine; extending about four hundred miles from north to &s;outh, and two hundred from ea&s;t to we&s;t. It is bounded on the &s;outh by Arabia Petrea; on the north by Mount Amanus, and a branch of that of Taurus, which parts it from Armenia Mi|nor and Cilicia; on the ea&s;t by the Euphrates, which parts it from Me&s;opotamia or Diarbekr; and, on the we&s;t, by Arabia the De&s;ert.</P>
<P>Syria, in general, is ble&s;&s;ed with a &s;erene, tempe|rate, and healthful air: being refre&s;hed, during the hot &s;ultry months of June, July, and Augu&s;t, by cool breezes from the Mediterranean. The face of the country is mo&s;tly level and delightful, and the &s;oil naturally deep, rich, and fertile; &s;o that it would produce in the greate&s;t plenty, if cul|tivated, whatever could be wi&s;hed for, either for the &s;u&s;tenance, plea&s;ure, or convenience of the in|habitants; but, like all the other countries po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Turks, a great part of it lies wa&s;te and uncultivated. With the little culture be&s;towed upon it, it produces, in many places, abundance of corn, wine, oil, figs, lemons, oranges, melons, ho|ney, canes, dates, and cotton, with aromatic and medicinal herbs. In Syria al&s;o are bred great num|bers of buffaloes and other oxen, camels, dromeda|ries, wild boars, deer of all &s;orts, hares, rabbits, and other game, with a kind of goats, who&s;e hair is long and of a beautiful colour, and a breed of &s;heep, who&s;e wool is very fine, and their tails &s;o large,

that they &s;ometimes weigh thirty pounds, and, as we ob&s;erved before, to prevent their being &s;poiled by being trailed on the ground, are borne up by a light kind of &s;ledge, fa&s;tened to the &s;heep. There is a great variety of wild-fowl in this coun|try; &s;uch as partridges, quails, pigeons, phea&s;ants, turtles, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Many of the plains are &s;o fat and tender, that they are turned up with wooden coulters, and ploughs drawn only by a &s;ingle hor&s;e, or a couple of bullocks. In fine, Syria, though there are &s;ome barren rocky mountains in it, were it not for the tyranny of the Turki&s;h government, the incur&s;ions of the Arabs, &amp;c. would be one of the riche&s;t and mo&s;t delightful &s;pots in the univer&s;e.</P>

<P>Of the&s;e mountains, the Libanus and Anti-Li|banus, in Coelo-Syria, are of a prodigious height and extent, with deep vallies running through them. They were formerly famed for their lofty cedars; but the&s;e at pre&s;ent are reduced to a &s;mall number, which bear leaves much like our juni|per, are green all the year, and have a fragrant &s;mell. A &s;mall &s;ort of them bear a kind of large apple, like that of the pine, only &s;moother, and of a browner colour, containing a kind of tran&s;parent and in&s;pi&s;&s;ated balm, which, at certain &s;ea&s;ons, falls from them by drops. The&s;e apples are always found in clu&s;ters at the end of the branches.

which bounds Syria on the north, are covered with &s;now a great part of the year, and in &s;ome of the deep hollows, whither the &s;un-beams hardly, if ever, penetrate, it remains undi&s;&s;olved the whole year. There are a great many natural re&s;ervoirs and cavities among the&s;e mountains, which abound with curious petrefactions. The mo&s;t noted rivers in this country are the Euphrates, the Jordan, the Ca&s;&s;imeer, commonly confounded with the Eleutherus, Licomes, Chry&s;orrhoas, the Orontes, Adonis, Cher&s;eus, with others of le&s;s note, parti|cularly that called by the Arabs Coik; but, by mo&s;t of our modern geographers, Aleppo, becau&s;e it runs by that city.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to Jordan, the name of which &s;ome derive from the Hebrew Jor, a river, and Dan, the place where it has its &s;ource; but others with more probability, from the brooks Jor and Dan, which, by uniting their &s;treams, form the river; tho' in &s;cripture, and in other authors, it is &s;aid to have con&s;tantly overflowed its banks, by the melting of the &s;nows in the neighbouring moun|tains; yet our modern travellers tell us, that, as far as they can ob&s;erve or learn, it does not do &s;o now.</P>
<P>As to the antiquities of this country we &s;hall take notice of them when we come to &s;peak of the places in or near which they are &s;ound.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the Mohammedans and Jews, there are a great many &s;ects of Chri&s;tians in this, as in the other countries under the Turki&s;h yoke, viz. Greeks, Latins, Armenians, Malchites, Maronites, and Jacobites. The Armenians differ but little from the Greeks, and have a patriarch of their own, who re&s;ides at Dama&s;cus. The Maronites of mount Libanus u&s;e the Syriac liturgy, give the &s;acrament in both kinds, holding with the Greeks in &s;ome points, and with the Eutychians in others. They have al&s;o a patriarch, who is always &s;tiled Peter, and looked upon as the true
<PB N="396" REF="3980">
&s;ucce&s;&s;or of that apo&s;tle. We ob&s;erved already, that the Jacobites are &s;o called from Jacobus Sy|rius, their founder; and that their patriarch is always named Ignatius, being e&s;teemed the true &s;ucce&s;&s;or of that ancient father and martyr. They allow but one nature in Chri&s;t, commu|nicate in both kinds, and reject the doctrine of purgatory, and prayers for the dead. The Dru&s;ians are another &s;ect here, who live among the mountains, and hardly retain any thing of Chri&s;tianity but bapti&s;m, allowing of marriage with daughters, &s;i&s;ters, and even mothers. They much re&s;emble the Curdes that inhabit the mountains of Armenia, and pay a greater veneration to the devil than to God, becau&s;e, they &s;ay, the former is a mi&s;chievous fellow, that mu&s;t be appea&s;ed with &s;acrifices, but the latter a good-natured man.</P>
<P>The Jews here, as in the re&s;t of Turky, both in A&s;ia and Europe, are the chief brokers in the mercantile, as their wives are in the intriguing way. The latter, under cloak of dealing in fine jewels, laces, &amp;c. get admittance, not only into the hou&s;es, but even the harams of the Turks.</P>
<P>The language &s;poken by the pre&s;ent Syrians is a kind of corrupt Arabic or More&s;co; be&s;ides which, mo&s;t of the inhabitants of the trading towns &s;peak a kind of corrupt Italian, called Lingua Franca.</P>
<P>Each of the three grand divi&s;ions, of Syria, mentioned above, viz. Syria, properly &s;o called, Phenicia, and Pale&s;tine, have a ba&s;ha, or begler|beg, &s;ubordinate to whom are a great many &s;angi|acs, ziams, and timars, be&s;ides the cadies, or judges, who determine private cau&s;es between man and man, both civil and criminal. We now pro|ceed to a more particular de&s;cription of the three grand divi&s;ions.</P>
<P>Syria Proper is bounded on the north by the Le&s;&s;er Armenia; on the &s;outh by Arabia De&s;erta
<PB N="397" REF="3990">
and Phenice; on the we&s;t by the Mediterranean; and on the ea&s;t by Me&s;opotamia. It was antient|ly divided into Coelo&s;yria, or Syria the hollow; Syria Antiochene, or Seleucis; and Syria Coma|gene. The two la&s;t had the epithets of Antio|chene and Comagene, from their capitals, or ra|ther from the kings Antiochus and Seleucus, who founded tho&s;e cities. The principal places, at pre|&s;ent, in Comagene are,</P>
<P>Samo&s;ata, once the capital of it, and the birth|place of the witty &s;atirical Lucian; but now a poor village, &s;urrounded with the ruins of the antient city. It &s;tands on the river Euphrates, near the confines of the greater Armenia, and is called by the Turks Scemp&s;al.</P>
<P>Dolica, antiently an epi&s;copal &s;ee, under that of Antioch, but at pre&s;ent a paultry town, call|ed Doliche, ill peopled, and wor&s;e built, and &s;itu|ate on the river Mar&s;yas, which falls into the Euphrates.</P>
<P>Of the antient cities, Germanicia, Singa, Anti|ochia ad Taurum, Catamana, Deba, Chaonia, and Chelinadura, that were &s;ituate in this part of Syria; little is now left but the names, or, perhaps, &s;ome ruins and monuments.</P>
<P>In that divi&s;ion of Syria, formerly called Antio|chene or Seleucis; and bounded on the &s;outh by Coelo-Syria and Phenicia; on the north by Co|mogene; on the we&s;t by the Mediterranean; and on the ea&s;t by Me&s;opotamia, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable places at pre&s;ent are,</P>
<P>Scanderoon, formerly called Alexandretta, or Lit|tle Alexandria, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from Alexandria in Egypt, a &s;ea port town, &s;ituate on the gulph of Ajazzo, fifty-two miles we&s;t of Aleppo. It is &s;o unhealthy a place, e&s;pecially during the hot months, that the inhabitants, who are mo&s;tly Greeks, are then obliged to retire to a village, &s;ituate on a hill
<PB N="398" REF="4000">
about four leagues off, and it would, in all likeli|hood, have been long &s;ince quite abandoned, but for its being the re&s;idence of the Chri&s;tian con&s;uls and factors, and the neare&s;t port to Aleppo. The hou&s;es in this town are very mean, and mo&s;tly of wood; but the con&s;uls and merchants have hand|&s;ome hou&s;es about a mile or two from it. It is &s;aid the corre&s;pondence between the cities of Alep|po and Scanderoon is carried on by means of pigeons, which are taught to fly with letters about their necks from the one to the other. There is an old ca&s;tle, with a Turki&s;h governor, and a few &s;oldiers at Scanderoon.</P>
<P>Seleucia, &s;irnamed Piera, from the di&s;trict it &s;tood in, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from another of the &s;ame name on the Tigris, was formerly a con&s;i|derable &s;ea-port town, but now a poor village, &s;ituate on the Mediterranean, at the mouth of the Orontes, about &s;ixty miles &s;outh of Scanderoon, and, by the Turks, called Seluki Jelber, but by the Franks, Port St. Simeon.</P>
<P>Latakia, or Ladhikiya, formerly Laodicea, ad mare, or Libera, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from another within land, a con&s;iderable &s;ea-port town, on a promontory of its name, twenty eight miles &s;outh of Seleucia. It was at fir&s;t founded by Seleucus Nicanor, or the Victorious, and called by his mo|ther's name.</P>
<P>Torto&s;a, antiently Ortho&s;ia, and Antaradus, from its being &s;ituate over again&s;t the little i&s;land of Aradus, once a famed &s;ea-port, and an epi&s;co|pal &s;ee; but is at pre&s;ent a poor place, inhabit|ed by fi&s;hermen. It lies about nine miles north from Tripoli.</P>
<P>Antioch, antiently the capital of all Syria, and one of the noble&s;t cities in the world, but at pre|&s;ent reduced to a poor &s;traggling town, called, by the Turks, Antackia, and &s;ituate on the river Ha&s;i,
<PB N="399" REF="4010">
antiently Orontes, about thirty miles &s;outh from Scanderoon, and fifty-four &s;outh-we&s;t of Aleppo. The town looks at a di&s;tance like a fore&s;t from the fruit trees and gardens, and the va&s;t number of plantanes, poplars, &s;ycamores, &amp;c. in and about it. Here is a ca&s;tle, that commands the town and the river, and &s;ome con&s;iderable remains of antient temples, walls, churches, &amp;c. together with a &s;pa|cious canal.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>In COELO SYRIA, the places of mo&s;t note are,</HEAD>
<P>Aleppo, Alep, or Halap, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the an|tient Beraea, now the capital of Syria, and the mo&s;t con&s;iderable town in all the Turki&s;h dominions, next to Con&s;tantinople and Grand Cairo. It &s;tands on four hills, twenty-two leagues ea&s;t of Scan|deroon, &s;urrounded with a &s;pacious plain, pro|ducing plenty of corn, wine, oil, and a variety of other fruits, e&s;pecially mulberries, and a fine &s;ort of cucumbers, which they eat green and without paring. Here are al&s;o almonds, pi&s;tachios, figs, lemons, oranges, citrons, pomegranates, mu&s;k|melons, water-melons, artichokes, turnips, radi&s;h, onions, garlic, cauliflowers, kidney beans, and o|ther pul&s;e; but few apples, pears, cherries, goo&s;e|berries, and &s;uch like, and little gra&s;s or oats. The air here is very pure, &s;erene, and healthy. From May to September &s;carce a cloud is to be &s;een; &s;o that the inhabitants, during that time, lie all night on the tops of their hou&s;es, without danger. The city is about three miles in circuit, hath twelve gates, a ca&s;tle on a hill in the centre, three large &s;uburbs, pretty &s;trong walls flanked with towers, about one hundred and twenty mo&s;ques, &s;ome of them very magnificent, &s;everal Turki&s;h mona&s;|teries, colleges, kaans or inns, bazars, divans, and other public edifices, which in general make a bet|ter

figure within than without. Mo&s;t of the &s;treets are well paved, and the hou&s;es better built than they commonly are in other towns of Turky. The town is well &s;upplied with provi&s;ions of all &s;orts, and water is brought to it by aqueducts from a river near two days journey from the town. The ca&s;tle is well mounted with cannon, and has a good garri&s;on. The whole number of the in|habitants, Jews, Turks and Chri&s;tians, in the city and &s;uburbs, is about two hundred and fifty thou|&s;and. The trade of this city is very con&s;iderable; for hither are brought all the commodities of Eu|rope on the one hand, and tho&s;e of A&s;ia on the other, and from hence again exported, the former into A&s;ia, and the latter to Europe. There are al&s;o &s;everal manufactures here, particularly tho&s;e of fine Turky-leather, &s;ilk, camblet, and &s;oap. The principal commodities brought from hence to Europe, are raw-&s;ilk, cotton, grogram-yarn, galls, and great variety of drugs. The Engli&s;h, French, Dutch, Italians, Arabians, Per&s;ians, Indians, &amp;c. have their con&s;uls at Aleppo; but the Engli&s;h trade both here, and in other towns of the Levant, is &s;aid to be much declined from what it was for|merly, and that of the French much enlarged. The city is governed by a ba&s;&s;a, who commands the whole country from Scanderoon to the Euphrates. Under him are the agas or governors of the city and ca&s;tle, together with the &s;ub-ba&s;&s;a, who&s;e office is to go the rounds every night, as captain of the watch, and to execute the ba&s;&s;a's &s;entence on cri|minals and delinquents. The cadi is the &s;ole judge in all civil matters, and makes and di&s;&s;olves all marriage contracts; confirms acts of &s;ale and purcha&s;e; and creates ma&s;ters of every trade to prevent frauds and abu&s;es. On the road between this city and Scanderoon, are to be &s;een the ruins of many &s;tately churches, with a great number of

&s;tone coffins lying above ground, together with &s;everal repo&s;itories of the dead, hewn out of the firm rock, but without any in&s;criptions.</P>
<P>Apamea, antiently a noble city, built by Seleu|cus Nicanor, and named from his mother; as Antioch was from his father, Laodicea from his &s;i&s;ter, and Seleucia from him&s;elf. Tho' half ruin|ed, it is &s;till a con&s;iderable town, &s;tanding on a &s;pot of ground almo&s;t intirely &s;urrounded by a lake, formed by the river Orontes, about &s;ixty miles from Aleppo towards the &s;outh. The water of the Orontes is conveyed by aqueducts and channels into every part of it. The Greeks call it Hama. It is the &s;eat of a ba&s;ha, who&s;e government is pretty exten&s;ive.</P>
<P>Margat, antiently Marathos, and a con&s;iderable city, but now a poor town, near mount Li&s;a, be|tween Antioch and Torto&s;a.</P>
<P>Eme&s;a, Emi&s;a, Emi&s;&s;a, Eme&s;&s;a, antiently a city of great note, and very &s;trong. It is now called Chems and Aman, or Haman, and makes &s;till a con&s;iderable figure, &s;tanding about thirty miles &s;outh-ea&s;t of Hama, in a plea&s;ant fertile country; here is a ca&s;tle, &s;trong walls, &s;everal hand&s;ome mo&s;ques, churches, kaans, bazars, and gardens. It is governed by a deputy under the beglerbeg of Dama&s;cus, who re&s;ides with his garri&s;on in the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>About &s;ixty miles from hence, towards the ea&s;t, lie the ruins of Tadmor or Palmyra, now called Fayd or Tam&ocirc;s, and inhabited by &s;ome poor peo|ple, mo&s;tly Arabs. The noble, or rather &s;tupen|dous ruins of ca&s;tles, towers, palaces, temples, piazzas, baths, and &s;epulchres, with the many &s;tate|ly columns of marble, porphyry, &amp;c. have been de&s;|cribed by many travellers; but by none &s;o ac|curately and minutely as by the late Mr. Dawkins and Mr. Wood, to whom we refer the curious

<HEAD>PHENICIA.</HEAD>
<P>Phenicia, the &s;econd divi&s;ion of Syria, taken in its large&s;t &s;en&s;e, is bounded by the Mediterranean on the we&s;t; by Coelo-Syria and Batanea on the ea&s;t; by Syria Proper on the north; and Pale&s;tine on the &s;outh.</P>
<P>This country formerly made a great figure; e&s;pecially by its &s;kill in navigation, its manufac|tures, commerce, and colonies. It is but a narrow &s;lip of land, running along the &s;ea-coa&s;t from north to &s;outh; but there were many fine cities and ports in it in former times. It was then divided into Phenicia Maritima, and Syro-Phenicia, or Phenicia ad Libanum; but is now a part of the begler|bergate of Tripoli. The places of mo&s;t note in it at pre&s;ent are,</P>
<P>Tripoli, Tarabolos, or Tripolis, with the epithet of Syria, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from other towns of the &s;ame name in other countries, particularly that in Barbary, is a large, populous, &s;trong city, &s;ituated about half a mile from the &s;ea, at the foot of Mount Libanus, between Torto&s;a and Botrys. It had the name of Tripoli from its forming once three di&s;|tinct towns, at a &s;mall di&s;tance from one another. The number of its inhabitants is computed at be|tween fifty and &s;ixty thou&s;and, Turks, Jews, and Chri&s;tians. The port, which is rather an open &s;ea than an inclo&s;ed harbour, is guarded by &s;everal ca&s;tles or towers, built along the &s;hore, at proper di&s;tances, and well mounted with cannon. The city enjoys a clear healthy air, &s;tands in a rich fruitful country, and is well &s;upplied with water
<PB N="403" REF="4050">
from a &s;mall river that runs through it. The beg|lerbeg re&s;ides in the ca&s;tle, with a garri&s;on of two hundred janizaries. The city is adorned with gar|dens and orchards, and plantations of mulberry|trees, for breeding &s;ilk worms; but the &s;treets are narrow, and the hou&s;es low. The chief manufac|ture is that of &s;ilk. The Capuchins have a mona|&s;tery here, and the Je&s;uits a college.</P>
<P>Botrys, Botrus, Botyrum, Botrun, Boteron, an|tiently a very con&s;iderable city, but now a poor village of fi&s;hermen, &s;tanding on the coa&s;t, to the &s;outh of Tripoli, and called Patron or Elpatron.</P>
<P>Byblus or Byblos, antiently a city of no &s;mall extent and beauty, but now a poor mean town, called Gebail, Gibel, or Gybili, &s;ituated on the coa&s;t, about twenty miles &s;outh of Tripoli. The river Adonis, de&s;cending from Mount Libanus, runs through the town. Here is a deputy, under the beglerbeg of Syria, and a &s;mall garri&s;on. The harbour is now almo&s;t choaked up.</P>
<P>Berytus, antiently a mo&s;t flouri&s;hing city, but now greatly decayed, the &s;treets being narrow, dirty, and dark, and the hou&s;es mo&s;tly mean and ill-built; but it is &s;till a place of &s;ome trade, and a &s;tage of the caravans, that go to and from Grand Cairo. It &s;tands on the &s;ea-coa&s;t, in a mo&s;t de|lightful fertile country, forty miles &s;outh of Tri|poli, and is called Baruti or Beroot, Beirut, and Beyrite. There are &s;ome &s;tately ruins to be &s;een about the town; e&s;pecially of the palace and gar|dens of Faccardine, the fourth emir or prince of the old Dru&s;ians, and of a noble amphitheatre, &s;up|po&s;ed to have been built by Agrippa.</P>
<P>The trade here con&s;i&s;ts in fine tape&s;try, &s;ilks, cam|blets, cinnamon, nutmegs, ginger, pepper, ca&s;&s;ia, rhubarb, and cochineal. A &s;ort of &s;tones, &s;ome of which re&s;emble olives, and others the genitals of men and women, are &s;aid to be found in the neigh|bouring
<PB N="404" REF="4060">
hills. Prodigious quantities of colocynth, with gourds, mulberry, and other trees, grow along the &s;ea-coa&s;t.</P>
<P>Sayd, antiently Sidon, a city famed both in &s;a|cred and profane hi&s;tory, e&s;pecially for its great trade, but at pre&s;ent is only a &s;mall town, containing about &s;ix thou&s;and inhabitants. Here are a great many mo&s;ques, a public bagnio, two large kaans or inns, one of which belongs to the French, and a fine &s;quare building, called the Cotton Market. The exports from hence con&s;i&s;t of rai&s;ins, oil, a&s;hes, Egyptian &s;oap, rice, blue &s;ilks, cotton, corn, Turky leather, &s;enna, pi&s;tachios, buffaloes &s;kins, &amp;c. On the north &s;ide of the town are great ruins of a fine port. The government of it is ve&s;ted in a ba&s;&s;a and aga, who have the command of about three hundred &s;oldiers, quartered in the ca&s;tle, or the town. The harbour is large, but not very &s;afe; and &s;hips generally ride at anchor un|der a &s;mall ridge of rocks, about a mile from the &s;hore. The French have a con&s;ul in this place, which is plea&s;antly &s;ituated, between the &s;ea, on the we&s;t and Libanus on the ea&s;t, thirty miles &s;outh of Berytus. In the gardens in the &s;uburbs are groves of mulberry, olive, tamarind, &s;ycamore, and other trees. The town is &s;aid to have had the name of Sidon from the elde&s;t &s;on of Canaan.</P>
<P>Sarepta, a city, antiently celebrated, among other things, for the abode which the prophet Eli|jah made in it with a poor widow, but at pre&s;ent no more than a village, called Serphant or Serphenda, &s;ituated on a hill, about a mile from the &s;ea, and five to the &s;outh of Sidon. The antient town &s;tood nearer the &s;ea, where many ruins are &s;till to be &s;een.</P>
<P>Tyre, by the Orientals called Sur or Tzur, which tho' antiently the capital of Phenicia, celebrated for its commerce, beauty, opulence, and fine purple, mi&s;|tre&s;s
<PB N="405" REF="4070">
of the &s;ea, and extremely well fortified, both by nature and art, hath, for &s;everal ages, been little better than a mere de&s;ert, in exact completion of &s;ome of Ezekiel's prophecies concerning it. For a full and accurate account of the ruins and remains of the antient city, haven, and aqueducts, we mu&s;t re|fer the curious reader to the de&s;cription given of them by the late learned Dr. Pococke, who was upon the &s;pot. The&s;e ruins lie on the coa&s;t of the Mediterranean, about thirty miles &s;outh of Sidon, and ten of Sarepta.</P>
<P>Acca, or, as it is called by the Franks, Acre, which had antiently the name of Ace or Accho; after|wards, that of Ptolemais, from one of the Ptole|mies, kings of Egypt; and, la&s;tly, that of St John d'Acre, while it was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the knighs of St. John of Jeru&s;alem. Though far from being &s;o con&s;iderable as formerly, it is &s;till about a mile in circumference, &s;tanding in a very large fertile plain, bounded on the north, at about twelve miles di&s;tance, by the mountains, antiently called Antilibanus, or Antelebanon; and to the ca&s;t by the fine and fruitful hills of Galilee, at the di&s;tance of near ten miles. It has now no walls; but is wa&s;hed on the &s;outh and we&s;t &s;ides by the &s;ea. There are great remains of the old port; within which &s;mall &s;hips come to anchor in the &s;ummer, and take in their loading. The French factors re|&s;ide here, in a large kaan or inn. The town, &s;uch as it is, &s;tands about twenty-eight miles &s;outh of Tyre, eighty-two north of Jeru&s;alem, and the &s;ame di&s;tance we&s;t of Dama&s;cus.</P>
<P>Dama&s;cus, antiently a mo&s;t celebrated city, and long the re&s;idence, fir&s;t of the Syrian kings, and af|terwards of the caliphs of the Saracens, is &s;till very large, &s;tanding about eighty-two miles north-ea&s;t of Acre, forty-five from the &s;ea, and &s;ixty-five &s;outh-ea&s;t of Tripoli, on the river Barady, former|ly called Chry&s;orrhoas, or the Golden River. It is
<PB N="406" REF="4080">
of an oblong figure, about two miles in length; and, being thick-&s;et with towers, domes, and mi|narets, and al&s;o with gardens and orchards, looks, at a di&s;tance, like a &s;tately city in a wood. The water of the river is conveyed not only into all parts of the city, but al&s;o into all the fields and gardens of the neighbouring plain. The public buildings here, &s;uch as mo&s;ques, bagnios, bazars, and kaans, are, in general, very hand&s;ome; but mo&s;t of the private hou&s;es are low, and built of no better mate|rials than &s;un-burnt bricks, or mud; yet many of them have large &s;quare courts, marble fountains and portals, and &s;tately apartments. There is a coffee-hou&s;e here which will contain between four and five hundred people, and is divided into two parts; the one for the &s;ummer, and the other for the winter. On a &s;pacious field, called the Mei|dan, in the neighbourhood of the city, is an ho&s;pi|tal for pilgrims and &s;trangers, of all religions, who are maintained at the Grand Signior's charge. The great mo&s;que, formerly a Chri&s;tian church, built by the emperor Heraclius in honour of Za|chariah, the father of John the Bapti&s;t, is a very magnificent edifice, into which it is death for any one but a mu&s;&s;ulman to enter. Almo&s;t in the heart of the city is a ca&s;tle of an oval form, with walls fourteen feet thick, flanked with &s;quare towers, mounted with cannon, and well furni&s;hed with arms and water. Here is kept a con&s;tant garri&s;on of fifteen thou&s;and janizaries; five thou|&s;and to guard the city, five thou&s;and to e&s;cort the caravan to Mecca, and five thou&s;and to attend the &s;ultan when he goes to Baghdad. There is a large hou&s;e for baking bi&s;cuit for the pilgrims that travel to Mecca; the &s;ultan allowing them two hundred camels load, and the &s;ame quantity of water. The chief manufactures of this city are &s;cimitars, &s;word|blades, knives, bridle-bits, and all other iron and
<PB N="407" REF="4090">
&s;teel wares, in which, it is &s;aid, above twenty thou|&s;and of the inhabitants are employed. The mer|chandizes of Turky, Arabia, and India, are brought hither by caravans, which are continually going and coming from Egypt, Aleppo, Baghdad, Mecca, &amp;c. The city hath eight gates, with &s;trong walls; and mo&s;t of the &s;treets, both in the city and &s;uburbs, are arched, to keep off the &s;un and rain. The neigh|bouring country is very plea&s;ant and fertile, yielding in particular very fine grapes, and &s;o large, that &s;ome of the bunches are &s;aid to weigh from thirty to forty pounds. Here is al&s;o a fine breed of &s;heep, who&s;e tails are &s;ometimes not le&s;s than &s;ixty pounds weight. There is a kind of alaba&s;ter found near the city, and a red earth, both much valued.

<HEAD>PALESTINE, or JUDEA.</HEAD>
<P>The third grand divi&s;ion of Syria, taken in its large&s;t &s;en&s;e, is Pale&s;tine or Judea. The fir&s;t of the&s;e names it had from the Pale&s;tines or Phili&s;tines, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed once a great part of it, and the lat|ter from Judah, who&s;e tribe was the mo&s;t con&s;ide|rable of the twelve, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the fine&s;t and mo&s;t fertile part of the whole land. Other names by which it hath been di&s;tingui&s;hed, are tho&s;e of Ca|naan or Chanaan, from Noah's grand&s;on, by whom it was peopled: the Land of Promi&s;e, the Land of God, the Land of I&s;rael, the Holy Land, and &s;ometimes, by way of pre-eminence, the Land. Profane authors have al&s;o called it Syria, Pale&s;tina-Syria, Coelo-Syria, Idumea, and Phe-nicia.</P>
<P>As to its &s;ituation, it extends from 31&deg;. 30&prime;. to 33&deg;. 20&prime;. north latitude, and from 34&deg;. 50&prime;. to 37&deg;. 15&prime;. ea&s;t longitude. Its boundaries are the Mediterranean on the we&s;t, Syria and Phenicia on the north, Arabia De&s;erta on the ea&s;t, and Petraea on the &s;outh. From the late&s;t and mo&s;t accurate maps, it appears to be in length near two hundred miles; and about eighty in breadth towards the middle, and ten or fifteen, more or le&s;s, where it widens or &s;hrinks. The longe&s;t day is about four|teen hours fifteen minutes.</P>
<P>The air of this country is very plea&s;ant and whole&s;ome, being &s;ubject neither to exce&s;&s;ive heats nor colds; and formerly, no doubt, was much more &s;o, when the country was better culti|vated.
<PB N="409" REF="4110">
Of the &s;ertility and richne&s;s of its &s;oil, in former times, we have the mo&s;t authentic evidence; in particular, that it yielded plenty of corn, wine, oil, honey, figs, pomegranates, dates, citrons, oranges, apples of Paradi&s;e, &s;ugar canes, cotton, hemp, flax, cedars, cypre&s;&s;es, and other &s;tately and fragrant trees, be&s;ides the bal&s;am &s;hrub, who&s;e balm was e&s;teemed &s;o precious a drug, and &s;till is to this day, under the name of balm of Gilead, though its virtue, reputation, and value, in con&s;equence of the mercenary practices of the merchants in adulte|rating and counterfeiting it, are much &s;unk, in compari&s;on with that which formerly grew in this country; that it bred va&s;t numbers of noble cattle, great and &s;mall, and abounded in fi&s;h, fowl, and all other nece&s;&s;aries and delicacies of life. Of this its antient fertility we are well a&s;&s;ured by authors, &s;acred and profane; and even at pre&s;ent, notwith&s;tanding it is inhabited by a poor, lazy, in|dolent people, groaning under an intolerable &s;ervi|tude, and all manner of di&s;couragements, by which their aver&s;ion to labour and agriculture, farther than what barely &s;erves to &s;upply their pre&s;ent wants, is become, in a manner, natural and in|vincible; yet, if we may credit tho&s;e among the moderns who have vi&s;ited it, were it as well peopled and cultivated as in former times, it would be &s;till more fruitful than the very be&s;t part of the coa&s;t of Syria and Phenicia; the &s;oil being generally much richer, and, all things con&s;idered, yielding a more plentiful crop. The ingenious Dr. Shaw &s;ays, the land is &s;till a good land, and capable of affording its neighbours the like &s;upplies of corn and oil which it is known to have done in the time of Solomon, were it proper|ly cultivated.</P>
<P>The principal mountains are, 1. That famous chain that goes under the name of Libanus, and Anti|libanus,
<PB N="410" REF="4120">
dividing Syria from Pale&s;tine, of which we took &s;ome notice in our general account of Syria, and &s;hall therefore be very brief here. It is computed to be about an hundred leagues in compa&s;s, and con&s;i&s;ts of four ridges, ri&s;ing above one another. The fir&s;t is very fertile in grain and fruit; the &s;econd barren and rocky, producing nothing but briers and thorns; the third, tho' &s;till higher, is &s;aid to enjoy a con|&s;tant verdure and &s;pring; the gardens and or|chards producing &s;uch a variety of fruits, herbs, &amp;c. that it hath been &s;tiled an earthly Paradi&s;e: the la&s;t and loftie&s;t is uninhabitable, by rea&s;on of its exce&s;&s;ive coldne&s;s, being covered with deep &s;nows almo&s;t all the year. It is inhabited by the Ma|ronites in the lower, and by the wild Arabs every where el&s;e, except on the top. Several con&s;iderable rivers have their &s;ource in it, viz. the Jordan, Ro|cham, Nahar-Ro&s;&s;ian, Nahar-Codicha, and Abou|ali; of which the fir&s;t only runs thro' Pale&s;tine. The we&s;tern part of the&s;e mountains is what is properly called Libanus, as the ea&s;tern is Anti-li|banus, and the hollow between Coele-Syria. The wor&s;t of them is, that they have generally been, and &s;till are to this day, a place of retreat and re|fuge for va&s;t numbers of robbers, and other de&s;|perate people. 2. Hermon, which is al&s;o very high, and like Lebanon, appears capped with &s;now. It is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the &s;ame with that now called by the Turks Jebel-Sheiek, and antiently Panius. 3. Tabor, called al&s;o formerly Mons Alabyrius, and Ilabyrium, from a city of that name that &s;tood upon it. It is much admired for its beauty, re|gularity, fertility and con&s;tant verdure, as well as for its &s;ituation in the mid&s;t of a large plain, and at a di&s;tance from any hill. Dr. Pococke tells us, that the winding a&s;cent may be about two miles, and the plain on its top about half a mile long, and near a quarter of a mile in breadth.
<PB N="411" REF="4130">
This mountain, on account of its being &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the &s;cene of our Lord's transfigura|tion, hath been held in great veneration, and much re&s;orted to by Chri&s;tian in all ages. 4. Carmel, which &s;tands on the &s;kirts of the &s;ea, and is the mo&s;t remarkable head land on all that coa&s;t. What hath rendered this mountain mo&s;t celebrated and revered both by Mohammedans, Jews and Chri&s;tians, is, its having been the re&s;idence of Elijah, who is &s;up|po&s;ed to have lived in a cave, which is there &s;hewn, before he was taken up into heaven; and where, by calling for a miraculous fire from heaven, which con&s;umed the divine &s;acrifice, he convinced the I&s;raelites of their folly in halting be|tween God and Baal. 5. Mount Olivet or the Mount of Olives, which &s;tands about a mile from Jeru&s;a|lem, commanding a pro&s;pect of the whole city, from which it is parted by the brook Kidron, and the valley of Jeho&s;aphat. It is not a &s;ingle hill, but rather part of a long ridge, with three or four heads or &s;ummits, from one of which our Saviour a&s;cended into heaven, and where the print of a foot in the hard rock, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been then made by him, is to be &s;een. 6. Mount Cal|vary, or Golgotha, held al&s;o in great veneration, on account of our Saviour's crucifixon on it. It &s;tood antiently without the walls of the city, being the place where criminals u&s;ed to be execut|ed; but Con&s;tantine inclo&s;ed it within the new walls which he erected. 7. Mount Moriah, which is &s;outh-ea&s;t of Calvary, and on which the famed temple of Solomon was built. 8. Gihon, which &s;tood about two furlongs we&s;t of Jeru&s;alem, and on which is &s;till to be &s;een that pool, whence Hezekiah brought water by an aqueduct into the city.</P>
<P>The other mountains in Pale&s;tine worth men|tioning, are Mount Gerizzim, and Mount Ebal, or Hebal, on which Mo&s;es ordered the ble&s;&s;ings
<PB N="412" REF="4140">
and cur&s;es to be put or pronounced; Mount Engadi, near the lake of Sodom; Mount Amaleck, and Gaha&s;h, in the tribe of Ephraim; Pi&s;gah and Nebo, on the other &s;ide Jordan, whence Mo&s;es was allowed to view the promi&s;ed land, which were only parts or &s;ummits of that famed ridge, called the mountains of Abarim, near that of Peor, or Baal-peor, over again&s;t Jericho; the mountains of Gilboa, famed for the defeat of Saul and Jonathan; and la&s;tly the mountain of Gilead, which was ra|ther a chain of hills, extending from north to &s;outh, beyond Jordan, and celebrated for its excellent re&s;in or balm. There are &s;everal others of le&s;s note, which took their names formerly from the towns built upon them, as the mount of Samaria, Hebron, Nazareth, Gibeon, Zophim, Shiloh, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The principal inland &s;eas or lakes are, the Dead Sea, or Lake of Sodom; the &s;ea of Tiberias or Galilee; the Samachonite Sea, or that antiently called the &s;ea of Jezer; becau&s;e it lay near a city of that name. The fir&s;t of the&s;e is frequently called al&s;o the A&s;phaltite Lake, on account of the va&s;t quantities of that bituminous drug, which are thrown up by its waves, and driven by the wind towards the &s;hore. The name of the Dead Sea was given it, becau&s;e no creature will live in it, on account of its exce&s;&s;ive &s;altne&s;s, or rather bi|tuminous quality: for the Hebrews ranked &s;ul|pher, nitre, and bitumen under the general name of &s;alt. Many &s;tories have been reported and be|lieved concerning this lake, that are now found to be fal&s;e, as that nothing would &s;ink in it; that it ca&s;t &s;uch a &s;tench and &s;moke, that the very birds died in attempting to fly over it; that there grew apples about it, fair without, but all a&s;hes and bit|terne&s;s within; and that the ruins of the five cities, that were de&s;troyed by fire from heaven, were &s;till to be &s;een under the water in clear weather; that
<PB N="413" REF="4150">
a &s;moke con&s;tantly a&s;cended from it, &amp;c. It is about twenty-four leagues in length, and &s;ix or or &s;even in breadth.</P>
<P>The &s;ea of Tiberias, or Galilee, where St. Peter, Andrew, John and James, exerci&s;ed their profe&s;|&s;ion of fi&s;hermen, is much le&s;s than that of Sodom; but abounds in fi&s;h, and is highly commended for the excellency of its water: the river Jordan runs thro' it.</P>
<P>The lake of Samachon, or Amacon, lies an hun|dred furlongs north of that of Tiberias, near the &s;pring-head of the Jordan. Its length is computed at near &s;ixty furlongs, and its breadth at about four, where wide&s;t. There are other two lakes in this country, viz. tho&s;e of Phiala and Jazar, but they are &s;mall and incon&s;iderable in compari&s;on of the others.</P>
<P>Of the rivers, the Jordan is the mo&s;t con&s;ider|able, and indeed the only one that de&s;erves that name. It hath its &s;ource at the lake of Phiala, ju&s;t mentioned, about ten miles north of that of Samachon. After running for about one hundred and twenty furlongs under ground, it emerges at a place called the Paneon, or Paneas, and from thence bends its cour&s;e &s;outhward, pa&s;&s;ing thro' the lakes of Samachon, and Tiberias, and at la&s;t falling into that of Sodom. Its cour&s;e is rapid, tho' its bed is very deep. As to its breadth, Dr. Pococke tells us, it is about that of the Thames at Wind&s;or.</P>
<P>The other rivers, or rather brooks of Judea are, that, antiently called Arnon-Jabok, and Cherith, on the other &s;ide Jordan; the Sorec, Ki&s;hon, Bo&s;or, Belus, the brook of Jezreel, the Nahar-el-farat, and &s;ome others of le&s;s note.</P>
<P>The chief vallies and plains are tho&s;e mentioned in &s;cripture, or el&s;ewhere, under the names of the valley of Ble&s;&s;ing, or of Berakhah, on the we&s;t
<PB N="414" REF="4160">
&s;ide of the lake of Sodom; the vale of Siddim, or Ha&s;&s;idim, where the lake A&s;phaleties now lies; the valley of Shaveh, or Royal Vale and King's|dale; the valley of Salt; the valley of Jezreel, or E&s;draelon, which reaches from where Scythopolis &s;tood to Carmel; the vale of Mamre and Mam|bre; the vale of Rephaim; the vale of Jeho|&s;haphat; the valley of Hinnom, or of the children of Hinnom; the valley of Zeboim; the valley of Achor, near Jericho; the valley of Bochim; and not to mention any more, the valley of Elah, in which David killed Goliah. Among the plains are, that called the Great Plain, thro' which the Jordan runs; the Plain, or, as it was al&s;o called, the valley of Jezreel, or Edraelon: tho&s;e called Sha|ron, Saron, or Sarona, and Sephelah; and the plain of Jericho.</P>
<P>The whole country is now little better than a de&s;ert; antiently, indeed, and when the coun|try was in its mo&s;t flouri&s;hing &s;tate, there were certain tracts that were called de&s;erts or wil|derne&s;&s;es; but no more was meant, than that &s;uch places bore neither corn, wine, nor oil, but was &s;et a&s;ide for feeding of flocks of &s;heep and goats, &amp;c. Of the&s;e the chief were tho&s;e of Judah, of Ar|non, Ziph, Cade&s;h, of Mahon or Maon, of Tekoah, Bezer, Bozor, or Bozra, Gibeon, and others of le&s;s note.</P>
<P>Of the natural curio&s;ities found in this country, the principal are, the citrons, melons, olives, peaches, and other &s;uch fruit in &s;tone, upon mount Carmel; where are al&s;o, it is &s;aid, the figures of oy&s;ters, and other fi&s;h, and even of bunches of grapes. The olives are the lapides judaici of the &s;hops, which have always been an approved me|dicine again&s;t the gravel and &s;tone. Near Beth|lehem are found &s;tones exactly re&s;embling peas, and for that rea&s;on called the Virgin Mary's peas;
<PB N="415" REF="4170">
and al&s;o a chalky kind of &s;tone, which is called her milk. In &s;ome places, both of this country and of Phoenicia, and Syria, is found a whiti&s;h &s;tone of the &s;late kind, which in every flake, exhibits the figures of a great variety of fi&s;hes. Hot and me|dicinal waters may likewi&s;e be ranked under this head; and of the&s;e there were formerly, and &s;till are, &s;everal &s;orts.</P>
<P>At the di&s;tance of &s;ome few leagues from the Dead-&s;ea, and in &s;ome parts of Syria, as at Alep|po, Palmyra, are to be &s;een abundance of &s;aline efflore&s;cences. On a plain, near the &s;ame &s;ea, are a great many hillocks, not unlike the places in England, where there have been lime-kilns.</P>
<P>In the plain of Jericho, grows a kind of thorny bu&s;h, which yields a fruit, not unlike a &s;mall un|ripe walnut, from which the Arabs extract an oil, highly valued by them as a &s;overeign remedy for brui&s;es, when applied inwardly, and for wounds, when outwardly: they prefer it in both ca&s;es to the balm of Gilead.</P>
<P>On the &s;ame plain grows the famed wood-olive, the outward coat of which is green, like that of the common olive; but being taken off, di&s;covers a nut of a woody &s;ub&s;tance, ribbed longwi&s;e, and of the thickne&s;s of an almond-&s;hell. Another tree that &s;eems peculiar to this country, is that called caroub, or the locu&s;t tree, which bears a fruit like a bean, but flatter, in which are &s;ome &s;mall &s;eeds: the &s;hell of it, when dry, is eaten, and has an agreeable ta&s;te. They grow in the de&s;ert where St. John &s;ojourned, thence called St. John's de&s;ert; and, according to the monks, here are the locu&s;ts on which he is &s;aid to have fed.</P>
<P>As for the artificial rarities, or antiquities, we &s;hall mention the principle of them, when we
<PB N="416" REF="4180">
come to &s;peak of the places where they are found.</P>
<P>Judea was fir&s;t peopled by the &s;ons of Hamor Cham, who, with his eleven &s;ons, came hither af|ter the di&s;per&s;ion at Babel. Five of them &s;ettled in Syria and Phenicia, viz. Heth, Jebus, Emor, Girga&s;hi, Heve; who, together with their father Canaan, were the founders of &s;o many nations. By the&s;e was the country inhabited, when Abra|ham was called out of Me&s;opotamia, to go and &s;ojourn there. How mo&s;t of them were afterwards extirpated or &s;ubdued by the I&s;raelites, under Jo|&s;hua and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, the judges and kings, to|gether with their neighbours, the Ammonites, Moab|ites, Midianites, Edomites, Amalekites, and the inhabitants of Ba&s;han, Argob, and Zobah. How the land was divided among the ten tribes, is well known to every one who is in the lea&s;t acquainted with the &s;criptures; and al&s;o how the form of go|vernment was changed from a &s;ort of commonwealth to a monarchy; how the kingdom was &s;plit into two under Jeroboam, the &s;on of Solomon; and how the kingdom of I&s;rael was fir&s;t &s;ubdued, and then that of Judah, and the inhabitants carried captive to Babylon. The di&s;tinction of the&s;e two king|doms continued a con&s;iderable time, under the &s;econd temple, or after the return from the Baby|loni&s;h captivity; but one of them, viz. that of I&s;rael had taken a new name, namely, that of Samaria, from its capital, and the inhabitants, now a mixture of the old I&s;raelites, and of new colonies, &s;ent thither by the kings of A&s;&s;yria, after their conque&s;t of it, &s;till retained a violent antipathy again&s;t tho&s;e of Judah, and lived in a &s;tate of con&s;tant ho&s;tility with them, till they were &s;ubdued by the Macca|bees, and their metropolis de&s;troyed. Under the Romans, the country began to be divided into tetrarchies, and toparchies, &s;ome greater than others:
<PB N="417" REF="4190">
the larger were tho&s;e of Judea, Samaria and Ga|lilee, Upper and Lower; the le&s;&s;er, tho&s;e of Gerari|tica, Sarona, and others of le&s;s note, all which were on this &s;ide of Jordan. The others, on the other &s;ide, were tho&s;e of Gilead, Peraea, Gaulonitis, Au|ranitis, Batanea and Decapolis. Jo&s;ephus men|tions another divi&s;ion, made in Gabinius's time, into five di&s;tricts, or as he &s;tiles them, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, or councils, agreeable to the Roman manner; and the&s;e were Jeru&s;alem, Jericho, and Sephoris, on this &s;ide Jordan, and Gadaris and Amathus on the other, which however did not la&s;t long. In proce&s;s of time, in the reigns of the Chri&s;tian emperors, it was divided anew into Palae&s;tina Prima, Palae&s;tina Secunda, and Palae&s;tina Tertia, or Salutaris, which included the far greater part, if not the whole country. As to the divi&s;ions and changes that happened under the northern Barbarians, Saracens, &amp;c. we &s;hall pa&s;s them over as of little importance.</P>
<P>As the antient divi&s;ion of Turky in A&s;ia, in general, and particularly of this country, are better known than the modern or Turki&s;h, we &s;hall treat of it according to the former; and in our account of the di&s;tricts allotted to the &s;everal tribes, we &s;hall begin with tho&s;e of the two tribes and a half &s;eated beyond the Jordan, and then proceed to tho&s;e of the other nine and a half, on this &s;ide of that river, taking them as they lie from north to &s;outh.</P>
<P>The lot of Ruben extended from the north-ea&s;t coa&s;ts of the Dead Sea, along the ea&s;tern banks of the Jordan, and was bounded on the &s;outh by the river Arnon, which &s;eparated it from the country then inhabited by the Midianites; on the north by another &s;mall river, which parted it from the lot of Gad; and on the ea&s;t was hemmed in by the Moabites and Ammonites. This di&s;trict was then very fertile in corn, wine, and fruits, and had fine
<PB N="418" REF="4200">
pa&s;ture grounds; but, tho' the &s;oil is &s;till good in many parts, it is now, in a manner, quite neglected. The mountains, antiently called Nebo, Pi&s;gah, and Peor &s;tood in it, and its chief towns were He&s;hbon, the capital, Jaza, Bamoth-Baal, Bethpeor, Me|daba, Mephath Abilah, Edom, or Adam, Shittim, Livias, Bethabarah, Macheron, Bezer, Bozer, or Bozrah, La&s;a, or Lai&s;h, afterwards Callirhoe, Ced|moth, or Kedemoth, al Jeth&s;an, and Bethje&s;imoth. Of the&s;e towns there are now no remains, the di&s;trict being little el&s;e than one continued de&s;ert.</P>
<P>The lot of Gad had likewi&s;e the Jordan on the we&s;t; the Ammonites on the ea&s;t; Ruben on the &s;outh; and the half tribe of Mana&s;&s;eh on the north. Tho' formerly rich and fertile, e&s;pecially in pa&s;|ture-grounds, it is now in much the &s;ame condition as that of Reuben. Its principal cities antiently were Mahanaim, Penuel, Succoth, Mi&s;pha, or Ma&s;pha-Rabbah, the metropolis of Ba&s;han, &s;ince called Ribboth, and more lately Philadelphia; Ra|moth-Gilead, or the high lands of Gilead; Rogelim, the native place of good old Barzillai; Thi&s;hbi, Sharon, Sopher, Armon, Mage&s;h, Debber, or Dab|bir, A&s;htaroth, Jazer. or Jah&s;or, Dibbon, Aroer, Bethharan and Enon, or Ennon, the place where John baptized, which &s;tood on the ea&s;t bank of Jordan, between that and Salim, about eight miles &s;outh of Scythopolis. In this tract there are now neither any modern built towns, nor any remains of the antient.</P>
<P>The di&s;trict a&s;&s;igned to the half tribe of Mana&s;|&s;eh lay north of Gad, and had the Jordan and Samachonite lake on the we&s;t; the hills of Ba&s;han and Hermon on the ea&s;t, and part of Lebanon on the north. It was afterwards called Upper Gali|lee, or Galilee of the Gentiles, and contained the territories of Gilead, Batanea, Gaulonitis, Aura|nitis, Machonitis, Ge&s;hur, and Argob; in which,
<PB N="419" REF="4210">
be&s;ides the capitals from which they were denomi|nated, were the cities of Bo&s;ra, or Bozrah, Sel&s;cha, Maachah, or Maacati, Ger&s;hon, A&s;htaroth, Adrach, or Hadrach-kedar, or the tents of Kedar; which, by &s;ome, is thought to have been the name of a canton, rather than a city; Sueta, Gamala, E&s;drai, Gilead, Pella, Abel, Abel Maachah, or Abel-Beth-Maachah, Jabi&s;h-Gilead, Corazin, or Corozaim, Julias, Beth&s;aida, near the de&s;ert of its name, Gira|&s;a, al-Girge&s;ha, Hippo, Gadar, and Ephron, and &s;ome others of le&s;s note. This di&s;trict cannot now boa&s;t of any cities, old or new.</P>
<P>The lot of the tribe of A&s;her lay on this &s;ide Jordan, in the north-we&s;t corner of the province of Lower Galilee, being bounded on the we&s;t by the Mediterranean; on the ea&s;t by the tribe of Naph|tali; on the &s;outh by that of Zabulon; and on the north by Phenicia. It was fruitful in corn, wine, oil, &amp;c. and had &s;everal con&s;iderable cities, &s;ome of which &s;tood near the &s;ea, but no &s;ea-port of any note. Of the&s;e cities the chief were Elkath, or Alcath, Cana the Greater, Gabala, Rahab, Aphek, Hacock, Gi&s;chala, Beth&s;hemi&s;h, Ach&s;aph, Beth-Dagon, Acca, Accoa, Acra, or Ptolemais, and &s;ome others le&s;s con&s;iderable. Of all the&s;e, Acra, or Ptolemais, of which we have given &s;ome ac|count above, is the only one at pre&s;ent exi&s;ting.

<P>The tribe of Naphtali extended along the we&s;t|ern banks of the Jordan, from Lebanon to the &s;ea of Tiberias, having A&s;her on the we&s;t.

The only other town, &s;ituate formerly in this tribe worth mentioning, was Heiphah al Ceipha.</P>
<P>The lot of the tribe of I&s;&s;achar was bounded on the we&s;t by the Mediterranean; on the ea&s;t by Jordan, which parted it from that of Gad; on the north by Zabulon; and on the &s;outh by the other half of Mana&s;&s;eh. It was fertile in corn, wine, and oil, and contained the mounts Carmel and Gilboah, the valley of Jezreel, and the great plain of Meggido, called al&s;o the plain of Galilee, and now Saba. Its chief cities were Tarichea, Ce&s;ion, I&s;&s;achar, Camoth, Enghannim, Rabboth, Cade&s;h, Aphek, Enhadda, Shunim, or Suna, where the ho&s;pitable Shunnamite lodged the prophet Elijah; Endor, noted for the witch or &s;orcere&s;s, that en|tertained king Saul; Naim, where Chri&s;t rai&s;ed the poor widow's &s;on; Beth&s;heme&s;h, Jezreel, or E&s;|draelon, and Ca&s;trum Perigrinorum.

<P>The other half tribe of Mana&s;&s;eh had I&s;&s;achar on the north; Ephraim on the &s;outh; the Medi|terranean on the we&s;t; and the Jordan on the ea&s;t. It was beautifully diver&s;ified with mountains, val|lies

<P>The tribe of Ephraim, afterwards known by the name of Samaria, in which the rupture between the kingdoms of Judah and I&s;rael began, had the Mediterranean on the we&s;t, with the Jordan on the ea&s;t; the tribe of Benjamin on the &s;outh; and the half tribe of Mana&s;&s;eh on the north. Some part of this canton was rocky and mountainous, and the re&s;t level and fruitful. Its principal cities were Saron or Sarona, Lydda or Dio&s;polis, Elon, Rama|thaim or Arimathea, Bethhoron, Gazer or Ga&s;era, Timnath Serah, Pharaton or Pirathon, Ca&s;trum Hyrcaneum, Sichem or Sechem, &s;ince Neapolis, and once con&s;iderable, being a city of refuge, and af|ter the de&s;truction of Samaria, the capital of the revolted kingdom. On the ground where it &s;tood, between the famed hills of Gerizzim and Ebal, there is at pre&s;ent a town, called Naplo&s;a, or Na|plou&s;e, the &s;eat of a ba&s;ha, and the capital of a territory, con&s;i&s;ting of a hundred villages. Mr. Maundrell tells us, it forms two &s;treets, lying parallel under mount Gerizzim, well built, and full of people. According to the authors of the Univer&s;al Hi&s;tory, it is to this day the Sama|ritans place of wor&s;hip; they having formerly built a &s;chi&s;matic temple, which is &s;till &s;tanding, and repaired to by them on all their religious fe&s;tivals. The other towns in this tribe were called,</P>

the capital of the revolted kingdom, and rai&s;ed by its monarchs to a great height of &s;plendor. After it had been de&s;troyed by the A&s;&s;yrians, it was rebuilt by Herod, and adorned with many &s;tately edifices, of which there are &s;till &s;ome re|mains; particularly, towards the north &s;ide of it, is &s;een a large &s;quare piazza, encompa&s;&s;ed with marble pillars, &s;ome &s;tanding, &s;ome lying; together with the fragments of &s;tout walls, at &s;ome di&s;tance from it; but the piece of antiquity mo&s;t worth notice is the church, &s;aid to have been built by the empre&s;s Helena, over the place where John the Bapti&s;t was behead|ed, or as others will have it, buried; the dome of which, together with &s;ome other parts, adorned with fine marble columns, capitals, and curious Mo&s;aic work, &s;hew it to have been a mo&s;t noble fabric. The church, or rather the remains of it, are now divided into two parts, one of which be|longs to the Chri&s;tians, and the other to the Turks: which la&s;t is paved with marble, and hath a chapel under ground, into which one de&s;cends by a &s;tair|ca&s;e of twenty-three &s;teps: and in it are &s;een three tombs, &s;urrounded with low walls, in which, it is pretended, the bapti&s;t lies buried, between the pro|phets Eli&s;ha and Obadiah. They likewi&s;e &s;ay, that it was in that chapel that he was impri&s;oned and beheaded. The Turks will, for a little money, let Chri&s;tians go down into the chapel, and view the tombs, thro' &s;everal holes of the wall, that &s;ur|rounds them. Not far from the&s;e ruins Jacob's well is &s;till &s;hewed, and much revered, particu|larly by Chri&s;tians, on account of its antiquity, and of the patriarch, who&s;e name it bears; but much more on account of Chri&s;t's conde&s;cending to hold a conference there with the Samaritan woman. This well at pre&s;ent is covered with an old &s;tone vault, into which one being let down thro' a very &s;treight hole, the mouth of it is di&s;covered. It is

<P>Judca, properly &s;o called, contained the tribes of Benjamin, Judah, Dan, and Simeon, and lay on the mo&s;t &s;outhern &s;ide of the whole country.</P>
<P>The tribe of Benjamin had Samaria on the north, Judah on the &s;outh, Dan on the we&s;t, and the Jordan on the ea&s;t. In this tribe &s;tood the ju&s;tly celebrated city of Jeru&s;alem, the capital of the whole, the centre of the Jewi&s;h wor&s;hip and re|ligion, the &s;eat of all the Jewi&s;h monarchs and pon|tiffs, and of the famed &s;anhedrim, or grand court and council of the nation. This city, in its mo&s;t flouri&s;hing &s;tate, in the reign of Solomon, was divided into four parts, each inclo&s;ed with its own walls, viz. 1. The old city of Jebus, which &s;tood on Mount Zion, where the prophets dwelt, and where David built a magnificent ca&s;tle and palace, which became the re&s;idence both of him|&s;elf and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors; on which account it was emphatically called the City of David. 2. The Lower City, called al&s;o the Daughter of Zion, being built after the other, in which &s;tood the two magni|ficent palaces which Solomon built for him&s;elf and his queen, that of the Maccabean princes, and the &s;tately amphitheatre, built by Herod, capable of containing eighty thou&s;and &s;pectators; the &s;trong citadel, built by Antiochus, to command and over|top the temple, which was razed by Simon the Maccabee, who recovered the city from the Syrians; and, la&s;tly, a &s;econd citadel, built by Herod, upon a high and craggy rock, and called by him Autonia. 3. The New City, mo&s;tly inhabited by trade&s;men, artificers, and merchants: and, 4. Mount Moriah,
<PB N="425" REF="4270">
on which was built the famous temple de&s;cribed in the &s;ixth and &s;eventh chapters of the &s;econd book of Kings, afterwards rebuilt by the Jews, on their return from Babylon, and again by Herod, who greatly adorned and enriched it.</P>
<P>As to its pre&s;ent &s;tate, it is called by the Turks Cud&s;embaric, and Coud&s;heriff, and is reduced to a poor thinly-inhabited town, about three miles in circumference, &s;ituated on a rocky mountain, &s;ur|rounded on all &s;ides, except on the north, with &s;teep a&s;cents and deep valleys; and the&s;e a|gain environed with other hills, at &s;ome di&s;tance from them. In the neighbourhood of the city there grows &s;ome corn, wine, oil, &amp;c. The &s;tately church erected by the empre&s;s Helena, on Mount Calvary, is &s;till &s;tanding. It is called the church of the Sepulchre, and is kept in good repair by the generous offerings of a con&s;tant concour&s;e of pil|grims, who annually re&s;ort to it, as well as by the contributions of &s;everal Chri&s;tian princes. The walls of this church are of &s;tone, and the roof of cedar; the ea&s;t end inclo&s;es Mount Calvary, and the we&s;t the Holy Sepulchre: the former is covered with a noble cupola, open at top, and &s;upported by &s;ixteen ma&s;&s;ive columns. Over the high altar, at the ea&s;t end, is another &s;tately dome. The nave of the church con&s;titutes the choir, and in the in&s;ide i&s;les are &s;hewn the places where the mo&s;t remarkable circum&s;tances of our Saviour's pa&s;&s;ion was tran&s;act|ed, together with the tombs of Godfrey and Bald|win, the two fir&s;t Chri&s;tian kings of Jeru&s;alem. In the chapel of the Crucifixion, is &s;hewn the very hole in the rock in which the cro&s;s is &s;aid to have been fixed. The altar in this chapel hath three cro&s;&s;es on it, and is richly adorned, particularly with four lamps of immen&s;e value that hang before it, and are kept con&s;tantly burning. At the we&s;t end is that of the &s;epulchre, which is hewn in that form
<PB N="426" REF="4280">
out of the &s;olid rock, and hath a &s;mall dome, &s;up|ported by pillars of porphyry. The cloi&s;ter round the &s;epulchre is divided into &s;undry chapels, appro|priated to the &s;everal &s;orts of Chri&s;tians who re&s;ide there; as Greeks, Armenians, Maronites, Jacob|ites, Copts, Aby&s;&s;ines, Georgians, &amp;c. and on the north-we&s;t &s;ide of it are the apartments of the Latins, who have the care of the church, and are forced to re&s;ide con&s;tantly in it; the Turks keeping the keys of it, and not &s;uffering any of them to go out, but obliging them to receive their provi&s;ions in at a wicket. At Ea&s;ter there are &s;ome grand ceremonies performed in the church, repre&s;enting our Lord's pa&s;&s;ion, crucifixion, death, and re&s;urrection, at which a va&s;t concour&s;e of pil|grims commonly a&s;&s;i&s;t. For a particular account of them, we refer the reader to doctors Shaw and Pococke.</P>
<P>On Mount Moriah, on the &s;outh-ea&s;t part of the city, is an edifice called Solomon's Temple, &s;tanding on or near the &s;ame &s;pot as the antient; but when or by whom erected is uncertain. In the mid&s;t of it is a Turki&s;h mo&s;que, where the Jewi&s;h Sanctum Sanctorum is &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;tood. The building, which Dr. Pococke thinks mu&s;t have been formerly a Chri&s;tian church, is held in the utmo&s;t veneration by the Turks.</P>
<P>The city is now under the government of a &s;angiac, who re&s;ides in a hou&s;e &s;aid to have been that of Pontius Pilate, over-again&s;t the ca&s;tle of Antonia, built by Herod the Great. Many of the churches erected in memory of &s;ome remarkable go&s;pel-tran&s;action, have been &s;ince converted into mo&s;ques; into &s;ome of which money will procure admittance, but not in|to others. Both the friars and other Chri&s;tians are kept &s;o poor by the tyranny of the government, that the chief &s;upport and trade of the place con|&s;i&s;ts in providing &s;trangers with food and other ac|commodations,
<PB N="427" REF="4290">
and &s;elling them beads, relics, and other trinkets, for which they are obliged to pay con&s;iderable &s;ums to the &s;angiac, as well as to his officers; and tho&s;e are &s;eldom &s;o well contented with their u&s;ual duties, but they frequently ex|tort &s;ome fre&s;h ones, e&s;pecially from the Fran|ci&s;cans, who&s;e convent is the common recep|tacle of all pilgrims, and for which they have con|&s;iderable allowances from the pope, and other crowned heads, be&s;ides the pre&s;ents which &s;trang|ers generally make them at their departure. The mo&s;t remarkable antiquities in the neighbour|hood of Jeru&s;alem are, 1. The pools of Bethe&s;da and Gihon, the former an hundred and twenty paces long, forty broad, and at lea&s;t eight deep, but now without water, and the old arches, which it &s;till di&s;covers at the we&s;t end, are quite dammed up; the other, which is about a quarter of a mile without Bethlehem-gate, is a very &s;tately relick, an hundred and &s;ix paces long, and &s;ixty broad, lined with a wall and plai&s;ter, and &s;till well &s;tored with water. 2. The tomb of the virgin Ma|ry, in the Valley or Jeho&s;ophat, into which one de&s;cends by a magnificent flight of forty-&s;even &s;teps. On the right hand as one goes down, is al&s;o the &s;e|pulchre of St. Ann, the mother, and, on the left, that of Jo&s;eph, the hu&s;band of that virgin-mother: &s;ome add, likewi&s;e, that of Jehoiakim, her father. In all the&s;e are erected altars for prie&s;ts of all &s;orts to &s;ay ma&s;s, and the whole is cut into the &s;olid rock. 3. The tomb of king Jeho&s;ophat, cut likewi&s;e in|to the rock, and divided into &s;everal apartments; in one of which is his tomb, which is adorned with a &s;tately portico and entablature over it. 4. That commonly called Ab&s;alom's Pillar or Place, as be|ing generally &s;uppo&s;ed to be that which he is &s;aid to have erected in his life-time to perpetuate his me|mory, as he had no male-i&s;&s;ue. The place, howe|ver, both within and without, hath more the re&s;em|blance
<PB N="428" REF="4300">
of a &s;epulchre than any thing el&s;e; though we do not read that he was buried there, neither do the people here affirm that he was. There is a great heap of &s;tones about it, which is continually increa&s;ing; the &s;uper&s;titious Jews and Turks al|ways throwing &s;ome as they pa&s;s, in token of their abhorrence of Ab&s;alom's unnatural rebellion again&s;t &s;o good and holy a parent. The &s;tructure it&s;elf is about twenty cubits &s;quare, and &s;ixty high, ri&s;ing in a lofty &s;quare, adorned below with four columns of the Ionic order, with their capitals, entabla|tures, &amp;c. to each front. From the height of twenty to forty cubits, it is &s;omewhat le&s;s, and quite plain, excepting a &s;mall fillet at the upper end; and from forty to the top it changes into a round, which grows gradually into a point, the whole cut out of the &s;olid rock. There is a room within, con|&s;iderably higher than the level of the ground without, on the &s;ides of which are niches, pro|bably to receive coffins 5. A little ea&s;tward of this is that called the tomb of Zechariah, the &s;on of Barachiah, whom the Jews &s;lew between the temple and the altar, as is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed. This fabric is all cut out of the natural rock, eighteen feet high, and as many &s;quare, and adorn|ed with Ionic columns on each front, cut out like|wi&s;e of the &s;ame rock, and &s;upporting a cornice. The whole ends in a pointed top, like a diamond. But the mo&s;t curious, grand, and elaborate pieces, in this kind, are the grots without the walls of Je|ru&s;alem, &s;tiled the Royal Sepulchres; but of what kings is not agreed on. They con&s;i&s;t of a great num|ber of apartments, &s;ome of them &s;pacious, all cut out of the &s;olid marble rock; and may ju&s;tly be pronoun|ced a royal work, and one of the mo&s;t noble, &s;urpriz|ing, and magnificent. For a particular account of them we mu&s;t refer the reader, for want of room, to Pococke's Travels. In the neighbourhood of Je|ru&s;alem
<PB N="429" REF="4310">
is a &s;pot of ground, about thirty yards long and fifteen broad, now the burying-place of the Armenians, which is &s;hewn as the Aceldama, or Field of Blood, formerly the Potter's Field, and &s;ince &s;tiled Compo Santo, or the Holy Field, purcha&s;ed with the price of Judas's trea&s;on, for the burial of &s;trangers. It is walled round, to prevent the Turks abu&s;ing the bones of Chri&s;tians; and one half of it is taken up by a building in the nature of a charnel-hou&s;e. Be&s;ides the above, a great many other antiquities in the city, and its environs, are &s;hewn to &s;trangers; there being &s;carce any place or tran&s;action, mentioned either in the Old or New Te&s;tament, but they &s;hew the very &s;pot of ground where the one &s;tood, and the other was done; not only here, but all over Judea.</P>
<P>The other cities antiently &s;ituated in this tribe, but of which there are now hardly any remains, were Jericho, Gibeon, Bethel, Gibeah, Hai, Gil|gal, Anathoth, Neb, or Nebo; to which we may add the two noted villages of Bethany and Geth&s;e|mane.</P>
<P>At Bethany, which &s;tood on the road between Je|ru&s;alem and Jericho, are &s;till &s;hewn &s;ome remains of an old ca&s;tle, &s;aid to have belonged to Lazarus; and the tomb out of which he was rai&s;ed, and which hath a de&s;cent of twenty five &s;teps, and at the bot|tom, the &s;mall room where he was laid.</P>
<P>Jericho, antiently the mo&s;t con&s;iderable city in this tribe, next to Jeru&s;alem, is now dwindled into a poor village, without any remains of its former &s;plendor, except &s;ome arched parts of an old con|duit.</P>
<P>The lot of the tribe of Judah was bounded on the north by Benjamin; on the &s;outh by the moun|tains of Seir, or Edom, which divided it from Idu|mea; on the ea&s;t by the Dead Sea; and on the we&s;t by the Mediterranean. It was fertile in corn,
<PB N="430" REF="4320">
wine, oil, fruits, pa&s;ture, &amp;c. except where it lay contiguous to Idumea; and was the large&s;t and mo&s;t populous of all the twelve. The places of mo&s;t note in it were, Libna, Makkedah, Azecha, Beth-zor or Beth&s;ora, Emmaus, Nicopolis, Bezech, Bethlehem, Tekoah, Engaddi, Odalla, Keylah, Hebron, Jether, Jeremoth, Taphnah, Kirjath-Jea|rim, Maon, Holon, Gozen, Gelo, Cabzael, Hazor or Chadzor and Ma&s;&s;ada. Of mo&s;t of the&s;e no|thing remains at this day.</P>
<P>Bethlehem, the birth place of the Saviour of the world, and of David, from whom it was emphati|cally &s;tiled the City of David, is at pre&s;ent reduced to a poor village, &s;ituated on a hill, in a fertile and delightful plain, &s;even or eight miles &s;outh of Jeru|&s;alem. There is a magnificent church here, built over the grot, where the Divine Infant was born, to which a great concour&s;e of pilgrims yearly re&s;ort. It is roofed with cedar, and &s;upported by four rows of &s;tately pillars of white marble, ten in a row, and the walls are faced with the &s;ame &s;tone. Be&s;ides a great many other holy places in and about this vil|lage, as the &s;table, and the very &s;pot and manger where Chri&s;t was born and laid, they &s;hew al&s;o a grotto and a chalky rock, in which, they tell you, the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin concealed her&s;elf and child from the fury of Herod. Great quantities of the chalk of this rock are broken off, and carried to Jeru&s;a|lem, where, being &s;tamped with the &s;eal of the city, they are conveyed thence into Europe and other parts, from a &s;uper&s;titious notion that it acquired its whitene&s;s from &s;ome of the Virgin's milk falling on the ground, and that it has a miraculous virtue to increa&s;e the milk of &s;uckling women. In the neighbourhood of this village are three pools in a row, called the Sealed Fountains, one over ano|ther; and &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, that the water of the upper|mo&s;t may de&s;cend into the &s;econd, and from the
<PB N="431" REF="4330">
&s;econd into the third. They are all three quadran|gular, and all of an equal breadth, viz. about nine|ty paces; but in length they differ, the fir&s;t of them being an hundred and &s;ixty paces, the &s;econd two hundred, and the third two hundred and twen|ty; and all three are of a con&s;iderable depth, well walled and plai&s;tered, and contain a large quantity of water. About an hundred and twenty paces di&s;|tant from them is the &s;pring which &s;upplies them, and which the friars will have to be the Sealed Fountains mentioned in the Canticles. The aque|duct is built on a foundation of &s;tones and the wa|ter runs in earthen pipes, about ten inches in dia|meter, which are ca&s;ed with two &s;tones, hewn &s;o as to fit them, which are likewi&s;e covered with others, but rough &s;tones, well cemented together; and the whole is &s;o &s;unk into the ground on the &s;ide of a hill, that in many places nothing is to be &s;een of it. The work did formerly extend the length of five or &s;ix leagues; but there are now only &s;ome fragments of it here and there to be found, the re&s;t having been de&s;troyed by the violent hands of the Arabs, who make no &s;cruple to break all before them, whenever they are in want of water. From the&s;e fragments, it plainly appears to have been at fir&s;t a very expen&s;ive and &s;tupendous work. Oppo&s;ite the Sealed Fountains, on the other &s;ide of the hill, to|wards Jeru&s;alem, lie the Pools of Solomon, of which we took notice in our de&s;cription of Jeru&s;alem. All the&s;e re&s;ervoirs and aqueducts are &s;uppo&s;ed to have been executed by order of Solomon, to &s;upply not only his palaces and gardens, but al&s;o, as &s;ome think, the city of Jeru&s;alem, with water.</P>

is &s;till a hand&s;ome church in it, built by the em|pre&s;s Helena, over the cave where Abraham and Sarah, I&s;aac, Jacob, and Leah lie buried; which the Turks have &s;ince turned into a mo&s;que, and regard with the utmo&s;t veneration, as well as the Jews. This place is he capital of a di&s;trict, &s;tiled by the Turks, the territory of the friends of God, and con&s;i&s;ting of about twenty-five villages more.</P>
<P>Bethzor, or Beth&s;ora, formerly a very &s;trong fortre&s;s, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;tood on a craggy hill, about twenty miles from Jeru&s;alem towards the &s;outh, where is now a village called St. Philip, from a tradition that Philip bapti&s;ed the eunuch of queen Candace in a fountain near it.</P>
<P>Tekoah, formerly a con&s;iderable city, &s;tood on the &s;ide of a hill about nine miles from Bethlehem, and commanded a noble pro&s;pect. It now lies in confu&s;ed ruinous heaps.</P>
<P>Engaddi, now a village, &s;tands on the top of a high &s;teep rock near the Dead Sea, four miles ea&s;t of Tekoah. The mountains above it are famed for the great quantities of palms, and other ode|riferous trees that grow on them, and are full of large caverns, of which one is &s;aid to be that to which Lot and his ince&s;tuous daughters retired after the conflagration of Sodom, and another, that in which David &s;o generou&s;ly &s;pared the life of Saul, and only cut off the &s;kirt of his garment.</P>
<P>The lot of Dan was bounded on the north by Ephraim; on the &s;outh by Simeon; on the ea&s;t by Judah and Benjamin; and on the we&s;t by the Phili&s;tines and the Mediterranean. It was in length from north to &s;outh only about forty miles, and its greate&s;t breadth was not above twenty-five; but it abounded with corn, wine, oils, fruits, and all other nece&s;&s;aries. Here was the famed valley of E&s;col, or the Grapes, whence the &s;pies brought &s;uch noble &s;pecimens of its fertility to the I&s;rael|iti&s;h

<P>Joppa or Japha, now Jaffa, once a con&s;iderable city, and a &s;ea-port on the Mediterranean, was &s;eated on a high &s;pacious hill, which commanded a full pro&s;pect of the &s;ea on one &s;ide, and of a de|lightful fertile country on the other. The pre&s;ent town &s;tands on the declivity towards the &s;ea, is pretty well built, and drives a con&s;iderable trade in Rama and Jeru&s;alem &s;oap, and in corn, rice, and other commodities brought hither from Egypt. Ships cannot now come into the port, but are obliged to ride in the road before it, which, how|ever, is &s;afe and convenient enough. On the we&s;t &s;ide of the haven is a charming &s;pring, which &s;up|plies the town with water. There are two old ca&s;tles here, and the Chri&s;tians have hand&s;ome hou&s;es, to entertain all the pilgrims and &s;trangers of their own nation. The town is the &s;eat of a &s;angiac, under the beglerbeg of Dama&s;cus. Laza|rus and his two &s;i&s;ters, Mary Magdalen and Mar|tha, are &s;aid to have embarked in this port in an open boat without oars, and to have landed at Mar&s;eilles. It was here al&s;o the prophet Jonas embarked, when he fled from the pre&s;ence of the Lord, and was &s;wallowed up by a whale, or, as the Hebrew imports, by a &s;ea-mon&s;ter, or mon&s;|trous large fi&s;h.</P>
<P>Jamnia, antiently a con&s;iderable town, has no|thing now worth notice, being a poor place, &s;ituate on the &s;ame coa&s;t, between Joppa and the antient Azotus, or A&s;hdod. Of the other towns there are hardly now any ve&s;tiges.</P>
<P>The tribe of Simeon lay in the mo&s;t &s;outhern cor|ner of Judea; and was bounded by Dan on the north; the little river Sichor on the &s;outh, which parted

it from Idumea; by Judah on the ea&s;t; and by a &s;mall neck of land towards the Mediterranean on the we&s;t. The greater part of the di&s;trict was mountainous and barren, and the towns neither many nor con&s;iderable. The chief of them was Ziklag or Siceleg, Hain or Aen, Hormah, De|bir, antiently Kirjath-Sepher, Gerar, alias, Geza|rah, Beer&s;heba, Anthedon, and Rhinocolura. Of the&s;e Beer&s;heba, at pre&s;ent a poor village, being &s;ituated on the &s;outhernmo&s;t verge of all Judea, as Dan was on the mo&s;t northern, gave occa&s;ion to the proverb from Dan to Beer&s;heba.</P>

<P>A &s;mall part of the pre&s;ent Pale&s;tine, &s;ituate along the coa&s;t of the Mediterranean, and extend|ing from the &s;ea-port of Jamnia, to the mouth of the river Bezor, was long &s;ubject to the five lords of the Phili&s;tines. The capitals of the&s;e &s;atrapies were, Gath; Accaron or Ecron; A&s;hdod or Azo|tus; A&s;calon; and Gaza, with its &s;ea-port, called Portus Gazae, and Majuma. They appear to have been &s;trong, rich, and populous towns. A&s;calon is &s;till in being, tho' dwindled into a village. It &s;tands on the &s;ea-coa&s;t, was the native place of He|rod the Great, thence &s;irnamed A&s;colonites, and an epi&s;copal &s;ee from the earlie&s;t ages of Chri&s;ti|anity. During the holy war it was adorned with many &s;tately edifices, which have been all ruined &s;ince by the Saracens and Turks.</P>
<P>The town, now called Gaza, &s;tands on the &s;ame &s;pot as the old, between two and three miles from the &s;ea, but in a much &s;maller compa&s;s. It re|tains many monuments of its former grandeur, and on all &s;ides are &s;ome of the noble&s;t remains of antiquity; &s;uch as &s;everal rows of the mo&s;t &s;tately

marble columns, with all their ornaments; and &s;ome magnificent burying-places, with tombs, all of the &s;ame &s;tone, finely wrought. Among the&s;e is one in particular, &s;urrounded with an high wall, and now belonging to a Turki&s;h family, be&s;ides many others of large marble &s;tones, taken pro|bably from the ruins of other antient edifices, which are here in great number. Near the city &s;tands a round ca&s;tle, flanked with four &s;quare towers, and in good repair: it takes in only a &s;mall circuit, but is fenced with two &s;tout iron gates, and other works. Over again&s;t it is the &s;eraglio, where the ba&s;ha's wives and their at|endants are kept; and, a little above it, are the re|mains of an old Roman ca&s;tle, the materials of which are &s;till &s;o firm that the hammer can make no im|pre&s;&s;ion on them. Both the Greeks and Armenians have hand&s;ome churches here. Near that of the latter they &s;hew the &s;pot where &s;tood the antient temple, which Samp&s;on pulled down over his head. The ca&s;tle is the re&s;idence of the &s;angiac or go|vernor, who hath about three hundred towns or vil|lages under him. The country, at a little di&s;tance from the town, quite to Egypt, is inhabited by a race of wild Arabs, who are under no regular go|vernment, and always roving about.</P>
<P>Majuma, or new Gaza, was the antient &s;ea-port to the former, and, on that account, a place of &s;ome note. It &s;tood near the mouth of the river Bezor, about ten miles &s;outh of A&s;calon. There are &s;till &s;ome curious antiquities remaining about it; but whether they belonged to new or old Gaza, is not ea&s;y to &s;ay.</P>
<P>About two miles from the &s;ea, and three &s;outh from Gaza, near the frontiers of Judea, is Laris, Lari&s;&s;a, or, as &s;ome call it, Ari&s;&s;ae, a poor town, de|fended by an old ca&s;tle, and a garri&s;on of about an hundred men. It gives name to a gulph that

<HEAD>ARABIA.</HEAD>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SITUATION, EXTENT, and BOUNDARIES.</HEAD>
<P>ARABIA, taken in its large&s;t extent, lies between the 12th and 35th degrees of north latitude, and between the 53d and the 78th of ea&s;t longitude. The greate&s;t length, namely, from the northern extremity of the De&s;erts of Al-Jazira, to the Straights of Bab-al-Mandab, or Ba|belmandel, as they are commonly called, is be|tween thirteen and fourteen hundred miles; and the greate&s;t breadth, or a line drawn from a point on the coa&s;t of the Red Sea, about 1&deg;. 25&prime;. &s;outh of the tropic of Cancer, to the extremity of Cape Ra&s;-al-Ghat, is about one thou&s;and miles.</P>
<P>It is bounded on the we&s;t by Pale&s;tine, the i&s;thmus of Suez, and the Red Sea, called by the Arabs the Sea-Al-Kolzom; on the ea&s;t by the
<PB N="438" REF="4400">
Euphrates, the Per&s;ian Gulph, and Bay of Ormus; on the north by part of Syria-Diarbekr, properly &s;o called, Ir&acirc;k-Arabi, and Khuze&s;tan; and on the &s;outh by the Straights of Bab-al-Mandab, and the Indian Ocean. But the limits of the Proper Arabia are much narrower, reaching no farther northward than the i&s;thmus, which runs from Ailah to the head of the Per&s;ian Gulph, and the borders of the territory of C&ucirc;fa; which tract of land the Greeks nearly comprehended under the name of Arabia the Happy. Here the Arabs have been &s;ettled al|mo&s;t ever &s;ince the flood. The Ea&s;tern geographers make Arabia-Petraea to belong partly to Egypt, and partly to Sh&acirc;m or Syria; and Arabia-De&s;erta they call the De&s;erts of Syria: but as the Arabs have for many ages reduced the&s;e two provinces, either by &s;ettlements or continual incur&s;ions, the Turks and Per&s;ians, at this day, include them in Arabi&s;t&acirc;n, which is the name they give to Arabia. It may ju&s;tly be deemed a penin&s;ula, as compre|hending all that large tract almo&s;t entirely bounded by the Euphrates, the Per&s;ian Gulph, the Sindian, Indian, and Red Seas, and part of the Mediter|ranean.</P>
<P>Ptolemy &s;eems to have been the fir&s;t who divided the penin&s;ula into three parts, which he termed Arabia-Petraea, Arabia De&s;erta, and Arabia-Felix; and &s;ince his time, this divi&s;ion has been generally followed.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>As a con&s;iderable part of this country lies under the torrid zone, and the tropic of Cancer pa&s;&s;es over Arabia-Felix, the air is exce&s;&s;ive dry and hot, and in many places very unhealthful, particularly in that part which lies upon the coa&s;t. The heavens are &s;eldom or never overca&s;t with clouds. The air is
<PB N="439" REF="4410">
&s;aid to be more &s;ultry in the northern than the &s;outhern parts; being more qualified in the latter with refre&s;hing dews, which fall almo&s;t every night in great abundance. This country is &s;ubject to hot poi&s;onous winds, like tho&s;e on the oppo&s;ite &s;hores of Per&s;ia, which often prove fatal, e&s;pecially to &s;trangers. The heat of the climate is much in|crea&s;ed by the nature of the &s;oil, which con&s;i&s;ts, in a great mea&s;ure, of barren rocky mountains, or &s;andy de&s;erts, as appears from the very names of two divi&s;ions of it. Dr. Shaw, &s;peaking of that part of Arabia Petraea formerly called the Land of Edom, or Idumea, &s;ays: "Here are no pa&s;tures cloathed with flocks, nor vallies &s;tanding thick with corn; here are no vineyards or oliveyards; but the whole is a lone&s;ome de&s;olate wilderne&s;s, no other|wi&s;e diver&s;ified than by plains covered with &s;and, and mountains that are made up of naked rocks and precipices. Neither is this country ever, unle&s;s &s;ometimes at the equinoxes, refre&s;hed with rain; and the inten&s;ene&s;s of the cold in the night, is almo&s;t equal to that of the heat in the day-time." The&s;e remarks are no le&s;s applicable to many other parts of Arabia than this: the &s;outhern, indeed, de|&s;ervedly &s;tiled the Happy, is ble&s;&s;ed with an ex|cellent &s;oil, and, in general, is very fertile. The cultivated lands, which are chiefly about the towns near the coa&s;t, produce coffee, manna, myrrh, ca&s;|&s;ia, aloes, frankincen&s;e, &s;pikenard, and other valua|ble gums; cinnamon, pepper, cardamum, dates, oranges, lemons, pomegranates, figs, and other fruits; with a &s;mall quantity of corn and wine. In their &s;eas they have pearls in abundance, and a great deal of the be&s;t coral. Their mo&s;t u&s;eful animals are camels, dromedaries, and hor&s;es. The camel is admirably fitted for travelling in this dry, fultry, country; for it can &s;ub&s;i&s;t a whole fortnight without water. The camels u&s;ually carry &s;ix hun|dred
<PB N="440" REF="4420">
weight upon their backs, which need never be taken off during the whole journey; for they na|turally kneel down to re&s;t, and in due time ri&s;e with their load. The dromedary is a &s;mall camel, that will travel two hundred miles a day. The Arabian hor&s;es are very fleet, but &s;mall and ill|&s;haped.</P>
<P>There are very few fountains, &s;prings, or rivers, in this country; &s;o that it is no wonder that they &s;hould have antiently occa&s;ioned &s;o much &s;trife and contention. However, in the &s;andy plains of Ara|bia, there are &s;ome fruitful &s;pots inter&s;per&s;ed, which appear like &s;o many little i&s;lands, &s;urrounded by an immen&s;e ocean. The&s;e being rendered ex|tremely delightful by fountains, rivulets, palm|trees, a variety of vegetables, and excellent fruits, the Bedoweens, or Wandering Arabs, encamp up|on them with their flocks, and, after having con|&s;umed every thing, retire to others. The&s;e fruit|ful &s;pots, which are likewi&s;e frequent in the de&s;erts of Africa, were antiently called Aua&s;es, or Aba&s;es, by the Egyptians.</P>
<P>As to mountains, the mo&s;t noted are tho&s;e of Si|nai and Horeb, in Arabia Petraea; and tho&s;e call|ed Gabel-el-Ared, in Arabia-Felix.</P>
<P>The &s;ands in Arabia-Petraea and De&s;erta are ve|ry trouble&s;ome and dangerous, being driven, like clouds, by the wind; in&s;omuch that whole caravans, it is &s;aid, have been buried and lo&s;t in the de&s;erts, by &s;torms of wind and &s;and.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PERSONS, HABITS, MANNERS, CUSTOMS, CHA|RACTER, and COMPLEXION of the ARABS.</HEAD>
<P>The Arabians are of a middle &s;tature, thin, and of a &s;warthy complexion, with black hair and black eyes, which however are common to them, with other people in the &s;ame climate. Their voices are
<PB N="441" REF="4430">
rather effeminate than &s;trong. They are very &s;wift of foot, and excellent hor&s;emen; and are &s;aid to be a brave people, expert at the bow and lance, and, &s;ince they became acquainted with fire-arms, good mark&s;men.</P>
<P>The habit of the roving Arabs is a kind of blue &s;hirt, tied about them with a white &s;a&s;h or girdle; and &s;ome of them have a ve&s;t of furs, or &s;heep-&s;kins, over it. They wear al&s;o drawers, and &s;ometimes &s;lippers, but no &s;tockings, and have a cap or tur|ban on their heads. Many of them go almo&s;t naked; but the women are &s;o wrapped up, that nothing can be di&s;cerned but their eyes.</P>
<P>Except tho&s;e that live in the cities and towns on the &s;ea-coa&s;ts, they have no &s;ettled habitation, but rove from place to place, with their flocks and herds, for the conveniency of water and pa&s;ture. While they continue in any particular &s;pot, they live and &s;leep in tents. They frequently rob, or impo&s;e a tribute upon the caravans between Turky and Per&s;ia; and the king of Mu&s;cat is little better than a pirate, having generally a &s;quadron of cruiz|ers, with which he takes all the defencele&s;s &s;hips he can meet with, in the Per&s;ian and Arabian &s;eas. They pretend, that God gave permi&s;&s;ion to I&s;h|mael and his po&s;terity to take whatever they could, e&s;pecially from the Jews.</P>
<P>The food of the Arabs is chiefly rice, fi&s;h, herbs, veni&s;on, fowl, and mo&s;t other &s;orts of fle&s;h; but ca|mels fle&s;h is mo&s;t admired, and they take care to drain the blood from the fle&s;h, as the Jews do, and, like them, ab&s;tain from &s;uch fi&s;h as have no &s;cales. Their drink is chiefly water or &s;herbet; they have no &s;trong liquors.</P>
<P>The word Arab is by &s;ome derived from the Hebrew Harabi, which &s;ignifies a robber or free|booter. The word Saracen al&s;o is &s;aid to &s;ignify both a thief and an inhabitant of the de&s;ert: and,
<PB N="442" REF="4440">
indeed, the&s;e names ju&s;tly belong to them; for they &s;eldom let any merchandize pa&s;s through the coun|try without extorting &s;omething from the owners, if they do not rob them; but, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that one of the antient tribes of Arabia was called Saraceni. They are &s;aid to be the de&s;cendants of I&s;h|mael, of whom it was foretold, "that his hand &s;hould be again&s;t every man, and every man's hand again&s;t him;" yet they are very hone&s;t among them&s;elves, and, towards tho&s;e whom they receive as friends, they are not only hone&s;t, but civil and humane.</P>
<P>Dr. Shaw &s;ays, the wild Arabs (by which we &s;uppo&s;e he means the wandering Arabs) are a very fierce, rapacious, unpoli&s;hed race, without the lea&s;t literature among them; that Europeans have little or no conver&s;e with them, and if they had, could learn but little of them.</P>
<P>Though the far greater part of the nation de|&s;erves the character given of them above, yet there are many of them, e&s;pecially &s;uch as live in towns, that apply them&s;elves to trades and commerce, arts and &s;ciences, in which they often make a great pro|gre&s;s; being naturally ingenious, &s;ubtile, and witty, and great admirers of poetry, mu&s;ic, and rhetoric. Many of the Arabian performances in phy&s;ic, a&s;tronomy, and mathematics, &s;hew the authors to have been men of great genius and application. Figures, and the curious di&s;po&s;ition of them &s;o as to expre&s;s any number what&s;oever, with ea&s;e and expedition, is allowed to be an invention of the A|rabians. To conclude their character, both &s;exes are &s;aid to be very vindictive, and exce&s;&s;ively given to lu&s;t, as the natives of hot climates generally are. How &s;trong the Arab genius is tinctured with en|thu&s;ia&s;m and &s;uper&s;tition, and con&s;equently inclined to fable and romance, appears eminently in mo&s;t of their compo&s;itions.</P>
<P><PB N="443" REF="4450">
There are few or no roads in this country; the caravans that travel over the &s;andy de&s;erts, where there is no tract, guiding them&s;elves by the compa&s;s, as they do at &s;ea; and, as they have no wheel-car|riages, their merchandize is $oaden upon camels and dromedaries; and they carry their provi&s;ions with them, there being no inns or caravan&s;eras. If the weather be bad, they pitch their tents; otherwi&s;e, lie all night in the open air, upon carpets.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>LANGUAGE and RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>The vulgar language u&s;ed in the three Arabias is the Arabe&s;k, or corrupt Arabic; which is not only &s;poken here, but, with &s;ome variation of dia|lect, over a great part of the Ea&s;t. The true Ara|bic, which is &s;aid to be a dialect of the Hebrew, and by the people of the Ea&s;t accounted the rich|e&s;t and mo&s;t copious language in the world, is taught in their &s;chools, as Greek and Latin is among us, and u&s;ed both by them and other Mo|hammedans in their wor&s;hip: for as the Koran was written in it, they will not &s;uffer it to be read in any other. They look upon it to have been the language of Paradi&s;e, and think no man can be ma&s;ter of it without a miracle, as con&s;i&s;ting of &s;e|veral millions of words; &s;o that it is &s;aid there are no fewer than a thou&s;and to expre&s;s the word ca|mel, and five hundred for that of a lion.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tianity was fir&s;t planted here by St. Paul, and &s;ome of his di&s;ciples; but in many parts of it it was much clouded and corrupted, and in others almo&s;t totally lo&s;t, before the grand impo&s;tor Mo|hammed, their countryman, appeared, who here compo&s;ed and publi&s;hed his Koran, which, by de|grees, was embraced by all the Arab tribes, and af|terwards by many other nations. At pre&s;ent,
<PB N="444" REF="4460">
However, tho&s;e called Wild Arabs are rather Pa|gans than Mo&s;lem, or true believers and ob&s;ervers of I&s;lam, or the religion of Mohammed.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>GOVERNMENT.</HEAD>
<P>Some parts of Arabia, e&s;pecially towards the north, are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Turks, and &s;ome of the princes on the &s;ea-coa&s;ts acknowledge a dependence on them; but many of them reckon them&s;elves independent, particularly the xeriff of Mecca, who&s;e dominions are of a very large extent. The Turks, indeed, have the &s;ole navigation of the Red Sea, and thereby keep many of the&s;e princes pretty much in awe.</P>
<P>The wandering tribes &s;o little regard the Turki&s;h government, that the pilgrims from Egypt, and other parts of the Turki&s;h dominions, could ne|ver vi&s;it Mecca, if an army was not &s;ent with them for their protection.</P>
<P>The Wandering Arabs, called antiently Arabes Scenitae, and now Bedoui Arabs, Bedouins, or Be|doweens, are governed by &s;hekhs, &s;heikhs, or chiekhs, and em&icirc;rs. The &s;hekhs &s;uperintend on|ly particular dow-wars, that is, collections of tents, an&s;wering to villages or towns. Every one of the&s;e dow-wars, therefore, may be looked upon as a little principality, governed by the chief of that particular family which is of the greate&s;t name, &s;ub&s;tance, and reputation, among the Arabs that compo&s;e it. The em&icirc;rs or emeers, the phy|larchs of the Greeks, rule over a whole tribe, and con&s;equently their authority extends to many of the&s;e dow-wars. Some of the em&icirc;rs have al&s;o &s;ome|times the title of &s;hekh-al-kiber, or the chief &s;hekh. Among the em&icirc;rs, there is one di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the title of the grand em&icirc;r, who is in &s;ome re&s;pect &s;uperior to the re&s;t. The word &s;hekh
<PB N="445" REF="4470">
&s;ignifies an elder, and is equally applied to go|vernors and men of learning. Em&icirc;r &s;ignifies a ruler, prince, or per&s;on inve&s;ted with authority.</P>

<HEAD>HISTORY AND REVOLUTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>Arabia was antiently inhabited by &s;everal differ|ent nations, as the Midianites, I&s;hmaelites, Edom|ites, Amalekites, who&s;e po&s;terity, e&s;pecially that of the I&s;hmaelites, remained in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, uncon|quered by any of the neighbouring &s;tates, even by Alexander the Great, and the Romans, till Mo|hammed appeared, when they extended their con|que&s;ts far and wide. This their independence was in a great mea&s;ure owing to the exce&s;&s;ive heat and &s;ultrine&s;s of the climate, and the dryne&s;s and bar|renne&s;s of the &s;oil.</P>
<P>Mohammed, the founder of the Mohammedan religion, and the empire of the Saraceens, was born at Mecca, anno 578, in the reign of Ju&s;tinian, em|peror of Con&s;tantinople. He was de&s;cended of the elde&s;t branch of the honourable tribe of Kerey&s;h. His father Abd'allah dying young, left his widow and infant &s;on in very mean circum&s;tances; their whole &s;ub&s;tance con&s;i&s;ting but of five camels, and one Ethiopian female &s;lave: but his grandfather Abd'al Motalleb, took not only care of Mohammed during his own life, but at his death enjoined his elde&s;t &s;on Abu-T&acirc;leb, who was brother to Abd'allah by the &s;ame mother, to provide for him for the future. Accordingly Abu-T&acirc;leb was extremely kind to Mohammed, in&s;tructing him in the bu&s;ine&s;s of a merchant, which he followed. To this end he took him with him into Syria, when he was but thirteen, and afterwards recommended to Kha-d&icirc;jah, a noble and rich widow, for her factor; in who&s;e &s;ervice he behaved him&s;elf &s;o well, that, by making him her hu&s;band, &s;he &s;oon rai&s;ed him to an equality with the riche&s;t in Mecca.</P>

By the trade he carried on in Egypt, Pale&s;tine, and Syria, having got acquainted with the tenets of the Jews, as well as tho&s;e of the different &s;ects, into which the Chri&s;tians of the Ea&s;t were then un|happily divided; and having ob&s;erved with what implacable fury the Jews, and all the&s;e &s;everal &s;ects of Chri&s;tians per&s;ecuted one another, he from thence concluded, that the mo&s;t effectual way for him to aggrandize him&s;elf, would be to introduce a new religion, formed upon &s;uch a plan, that the mo&s;t abandoned part of the Jews, as well as Chri&s;|tians of all denominations, and even Pagans them|&s;elves, might be tempted to become pro&s;elytes to it.</P>
<P>In order to this, his fir&s;t &s;tep was to gain the admiration of the people, by his devotion and ab&s;temious life; he retired therefore frequently, e&s;pecially in the month Ramadan, to a cave in Mount Hara near Mecca; where at la&s;t, when he was about forty years of age, he opened the &s;ecret of his mi&s;&s;ion to his wife Khadijah, and acquaint|ed her, that the angel Gabriel had ju&s;t before appeared to him, and told him that he was ap|pointed the apo&s;tle of God. From this time he u&s;ed his utmo&s;t efforts to gain pro&s;elytes, in which he had great &s;ucce&s;s, tho' not without oppo&s;ition, e&s;pecially from &s;ome of the chief of the Korey&s;h. Tho' the Kor&acirc;n is &s;aid to have de&s;cended entire from heaven, in the night between the twenty-third and twenty-fourth of the month Ramadan, called on that account, in the Kor&acirc;n, the night of Al-Kadr, or the divine decree; yet was it communicated by the angel Gabriel to Mohammed, and by him to the Mo&s;lems, only by portions or chapters, for the &s;pace of twenty-three years. Agreeably to the author's plan and views, it is entirely adapted to the ta&s;te of the &s;en&s;uali&s;t; to &s;ooth and indulge men's vi|cious appetites in general, and tho&s;e of the Pagan

Arabs in particular. Be&s;ides the belief of the unity of God, and the apo&s;tle&s;hip of Mohammed, it inculcates &s;ome heterodox notions, borrowed from various heretical &s;ects, together with the ob&s;ervance of &s;ome particular moral duties therein &s;pecified, and certain Jewi&s;h and heatheni&s;h rites. It was fir&s;t written on the plate bones of camels, being dictated by Mohammed to his amanuen&s;is, for he could neither write nor read him&s;elf; tho' he is allowed to have been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of con&s;iderable talents, and of a quick wit, and in&s;inuating addre&s;s. He could bear affronts without any &s;eeming re|&s;entment; flattered the rich, and relieved the poor. In fine, he managed with &s;uch cunning and dex|terity, that he &s;oon gained a great number of pro|&s;elytes and adherents. This alarming the chief of the citizens, who plainly perceived that he had a de&s;ign upon the government, they had determined to &s;urprize him and cut him off; but he receiving timely notice of it, fled to Yathrib, which was af|terwards called Medina Talmahi, or the city of the prophet. From this flight, which happened in the year of Chri&s;t 622, the forty-fourth of Moham|med's age, and the fourth of his mini&s;try, the Mahometans compute their time, and the aera is called in the Arabic Hejira, i. e. the flight.</P>
<P>Mohammed was received at Medina with great joy by the citizens, who readily &s;ubmitted to him as their prince; and being joined by great num|bers of other Arabians, his fir&s;t enterprizes were the intercepting the caravans, which traded between Mecca and Syria, by which he greatly enriched his di&s;ciples.</P>
<P>Mohammed afterwards made war on &s;everal of the Arab tribes, and compelled them to embrace his religion, or become tributaries to him, declaring his cau&s;e to be the cau&s;e of God, and that who|ever died in defence of it went immediately to Pa|radi&s;e:
<PB N="448" REF="4500">
that the term of every man's life was fixed by God; and that none could pre&s;erve it beyond the appointed time, or &s;horten it by any hazards he might &s;eem to be expo&s;ed to in battle or other|wi&s;e.</P>
<P>His men being heated with wine, and deeply engaged in play, he was once in great danger of being &s;urprized; whereupon he prohibited wine and gaming.</P>
<P>In the year 627 he cau&s;ed him&s;elf to be pro|claimed king at Medina, having before a&s;&s;umed only the title and office of high prie&s;t of his religion; and now finding him&s;elf &s;ufficiently reinforced, he laid &s;iege to his native city Mecca, and took it; and hav|ing cut off all that oppo&s;ed him, he broke down all the images he found in the Kaaba or temple, a|mong which were tho&s;e of Abraham and I&s;hmael, and many more, which the Arabians wor&s;hipped as mediators for them to the &s;upreme God. This, which happened in the eighth year of the Hejira, A. D. 629, provoking the re&s;t of the Arab tribes, they a&s;&s;embled their forces, and gave him battle, but were defeated; whereupon he reduced great part of Arabia under his power, and &s;ome towns of Syria, then &s;ubject to the Grecian emperor, and died in the year 631, and &s;ixty-third year of his age. His &s;ucce&s;&s;ors &s;pread their religion and conque&s;ts over the greate&s;t part of A&s;ia and Africa; and even over &s;ome con&s;iderable provinces of Europe, reducing mo&s;t of France, Spain, Italy, and the i&s;lands in the Mediterranean, under the name of Saracens. It was his di&s;ciples that founded the four great monarchies or empires of Turky, Per&s;ia, Fez or Morocco, and the Great Mogul; to &s;ay nothing of &s;everal other countries they hold in India, in all which Mohammedi&s;m is chiefly profe&s;&s;ed: though there are &s;everal &s;ects, which

<HEAD>COINS.</HEAD>
<P>The coins, which are current at Mocho, the principal port of the Red Sea, are dollars of all kinds; but they abate five per cent, on the pillar dollars, becau&s;e they are reckoned not to be the pure&s;t &s;ilver, and the dollar weight with them is &s;eventeen drachms, fourteen grains. All their coins are taken by weight, and valued according to their purene&s;s: the gold coins current here are ducats of Venice, Germany, Turky, Egypt, &amp;c. The coma&s;&s;es are a &s;mall coin, which are taken at &s;uch a price as the government &s;ets on them; and they keep their accounts in an imaginary coin, called cabeers, of which eighty go to a dollar.</P>
<P>Having thus premi&s;ed all that we thought nece&s;&s;ary concerning Arabia in general, we &s;hall now give &s;ome account of each of the three grand divi&s;ions of it, viz. the De&s;ert, Stony, and Happy.</P>

<HEAD>ARABIA-DESERTA,</HEAD>
<P>Is bounded on the north by the river Frat, or Euphrates, which bending its cour&s;e ea&s;terly, &s;eparates it from Me&s;opotamia, or Diarbekr; on the &s;outh by Arabia Felix, from which it is disjoined by &s;everal ranges of hills; on the we&s;t by Syria, Judea, and Arabia Petraea; and on the ea&s;t by the Per&s;ian territory of Idr&acirc;k, and a part of Diarbekr, or the antient countries of Ba|bylonia and Chaldaea, or more preci&s;ely by a range of mountains dividing it from tho&s;e coun|tries.</P>

otherwi&s;e diver&s;ified than by plains covered with &s;and, or mountains con&s;i&s;ting of naked rocks and precipices. The few vegetables therefore, which it produces, are &s;tunted by a perpetual drought, and the nouri&s;hment afforded them by the natural dews rendered almo&s;t entirely u&s;ele&s;s by the in|ten&s;e heat of the &s;un in the day-time. All over the&s;e de&s;erts are found huge mountains of &s;and, formed by the violence of the winds, that conti|nually blow over them in the day-time, tho' they cea&s;e at night. However, there are &s;ome fruitful &s;pots, watered with fountains and rivulets, and abounding with palm trees, and a variety of ve|getables and excellent fruits.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that travel over this country, mu&s;t not only carry provi&s;ions, but &s;teer by the &s;tars and mariner's compa&s;s. There are great numbers of camels, &s;heep and goats all over it; but few or no hor&s;es, cows, hogs or oxen, unle&s;s towards the Euphrates, where the &s;oil is mo&s;t fertile.</P>
<P>The inhabitants, who call them&s;elves Bedoui, from the Arabic Bedoat, &s;ignifying a de&s;ert or champaign country, are continually moving from one part of the country to another, pitching their tents by lakes, rivers, or wherever they can find water and pa&s;ture. Some of the hords rob and plunder, wherever they have an opportunity; but others are more civilized, and value them&s;elves upon their fidelity and ho&s;pitality to &s;trangers, and e&s;pecially to tho&s;e who put them&s;elves under their protection. The women wear only a blue kind of long &s;mock, and the men a coar&s;e linen jacket, but the children go quite naked. Mo&s;t of them acknow|ledge no other government than that of their own emirs or princes, who have each of them a certain number of cheikhs under them, more or le&s;s. The word cheikh, as we ob&s;erved already, &s;ignifies an elder, and is u&s;ed to expre&s;s, not only the&s;e &s;ubor|dinate

chieftains, but al&s;o a &s;cribe or man of learning. Some of the tribes towards the north pay a &s;mall acknowledgment to the Porte, con&s;i&s;ting generally of &s;ome of their be&s;t hor&s;es, for its protection; but mo&s;t of them di&s;claim all &s;ubjection. The Turks even pay a tribute to &s;ome of them, to prevent their plundering the caravans and pilgrims. Their cheikhs determine all differences that ari&s;e among them; but an appeal lies from their &s;entences to the emir. They affect an extraordinary gravity in their di&s;cour&s;e and behaviour, and look upon the beard as &s;o honourable and venerable a di&s;tinc|tion, that no greater puni&s;hment or di&s;grace can be inflicted on them than cutting it off. They circumci&s;e their children at a certain age, and their religion is that of Mohammed. The Arabs, in general, are but little acquainted with fire arms; and their ordinary weapons are &s;words, &s;pears, darts, iron clubs, and &s;ometimes hatchets. They are good mark&s;men, and the hor&s;es on which they are mounted in their excur&s;ions are exceeding &s;wift.</P>
<P>A great many cities and towns are mentioned by antient geographers, as &s;ituate in Arabia De&s;er|ta, as Themma, Thema, or Tema, which was &s;o called from Tema the &s;on of I&s;hmael, and &s;tood near the mountains &s;eparating Arabia from Chal|daea; Seba upon the borders of Arabia Felix, founded probably by Seba, Abraham's grand&s;on; Gadirtha, Auzara, Pharga, Belgnea, Audattha, or Adittha, and Balataea, along the banks of the Euphrates; Salma, Calathu&s;a, Arrade, Tedium, Odagena, Luma, Dumaetha, in the inland parts; Artemita and Abera, on the &s;kirts of Arabia Fe|lix; Thauba, Erupa, Alata, Aurana, Choce, Ba|rathena, &amp;c. to the northward.</P>

Aurana, Auran, and Alata, Aladi, have any exi&s;tence.

Of the&s;e Anna, Argia, and Chavabeda, are the capitals of the three prin|cipalities into which Arabia De&s;erta is divided, and to which they give name; but as the two la&s;t of the&s;e principalities, with their towns, are almo&s;t unknown to us, we &s;hall only give a &s;hort de&s;cription of Anna, on the Euphrates, and Bal&s;ora, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable towns of the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Anna is &s;ituate in a plea&s;ant &s;pot on the banks of the Euphrates, and is about three quarters of a league in length, and about eight hundred paces in breadth. It is inhabited chiefly by A|rabs, of whom the greate&s;t part con&s;i&s;ts of the freebooters, who make excur&s;ions from it into all parts of the De&s;ert. Here the banditti, that infe&s;t the country, and make it dangerous to travel thro' it, meet to con&s;ult and deliberate where they &s;hall go a-robbing and plundering next. The city is tri|butary to the Grand Seignior; but the Turki&s;h aga, and his janizaries find great difficulty in levy|ing the tribute impo&s;ed by the Turks. The gar|dens in the city, and the neighbouring country, are planted with lemon, orange, citron, quince, fig, date, pomegranate, olive, and other fruit-trees. There are al&s;o &s;ome fields of corn. The hou&s;es in the city are &s;quare, flat, and one, or, at mo&s;t, two &s;tories high. It is &s;ituated between Dama&s;cus on the we&s;t, and Baghdad, about two hundred and twenty-five miles from the former, and one hun|dred and eighty-two from the latter, and is a great thorough-fare for the caravans to and from Alep|po, Tripoli, Dama&s;cus, Baghdad, &amp;c. All the

commodities that pa&s;s thro' it pay cu&s;tom to the chief emir of the Arabs.</P>
<P>Bal&s;ora, Balzara, Balzera, Ba&s;&s;ora, or Ba&s;rah, a city &s;ituate between Per&s;ia and Arabia, in the ex|tremity of the De&s;erts of Ir&acirc;k, a little to the we&s;t of one of the mouths of the Tigris, with which it has a communication by a canal, and about forty-five miles from the Per&s;ian Gulph, denominated likewi&s;e from this town, the Bay of Ba&s;rah. It was built by Ath&acirc; Ebn Ar&acirc;r, at the command of the khalif of Omar, in the 15th year of the Hejra, for the &s;ake of carrying on more commodiou&s;ly an exten&s;ive commerce between the Syrians, Arabians, Per&s;ians, and Indians. The circumjacent tract is looked upon by the Arabs as one of the mo&s;t delightful &s;pots of A&s;ia. However, the hot burning winds, that frequently blow there, are very trouble&s;ome to travellers, and &s;ometimes overwhelm them with mountains of &s;and, driven by the force of the&s;e winds out of the neighbouring de&s;erts. The city carries on a great trade, and is inhabited by Ja|cobites, Ne&s;torians, Catholics, Jews, Mohamme|dans, and Chaldaean Chri&s;tians, commonly called Chri&s;tians of St. John, who are pretty numerous here. There is a famous college or academy here, founded by Nezam Al Molk, the vi&s;ir, or waz&icirc;r of Moezadd&icirc;n Abu'lfelah M&acirc;lec Shah, the third &s;ultan of the Seljuks of Ir&acirc;n, called the college, or academy of Nezam. This city is &s;aid to be at pre&s;ent a flouri&s;hing &s;eat of literature, tho' inferior in number of academies to Dama&s;hk, or Dama&s;|cus and Kairo, or Al-Kahirah. The Engli&s;h and Dutch have their factories here, which are very con&s;iderable, and maintained by their Ea&s;t-India companies to carry on their commerce with China, Japan, and other parts of India, and for the di&s;|patch of their letters from all parts, into England and Holland, by the way of Dama&s;cus and Aleppo;
<PB N="454" REF="4560">
and the&s;e are carried by Arabs, hired for the pur|po&s;e, who are very &s;wift of foot. Mo&s;t of the commerce is carried on by the Armenians, Indians and Per&s;ians, who bring the riche&s;t merchandizes both of India and Europe hither by caravans. What &s;till increa&s;es its trade and opulence is, that the Per&s;ian caravans of pilgrims pa&s;s thro' it, both in going to and returning from Mecca; and not only pay con&s;iderable duties to the government, but exchange many rich commodities which they bring with them, for others which they carry off, when they depart homewards. One may meet here with merchants from all parts of Turky and Egypt, &amp;c. to buy the Indian commodities that are brought hither, and conveyed from hence on the backs of camels, which are always to be bought in this city. The hor&s;es which are bred here, are in great reque&s;t, and many of them are &s;old from a thou&s;and to two thou&s;and crowns. They are &s;aid to bear fatigue in an extraordinary manner, e&s;pecially the mares, running &s;ometimes thirty hours without meat or drink.</P>
<P>Bal&s;ora is &s;ubject to an Arab prince, who is tributary to the Turk, and who&s;e revenue a|ri&s;es chiefly from the exchange of money, hor&s;es, camels, and dates. His income is &s;o great that he is able to lay up three millions of livres every year, after all the charges of his tribute and government are defrayed. This prince gives full liberty to all nations to come and trade to his ca|pital, where &s;o good order is kept, that one may go &s;afely thro' the &s;treets all hours of the night. The city, tho' large and opulent, hath nothing ex|traordinary either in its public or private buildings. It &s;tands about two hundred and fifty miles &s;outh-ea&s;t of Baghdad, and about two hundred and forty &s;outh-we&s;t of I&s;pahan, in latitude 30&deg;. 17&Prime;. north, and ea&s;t longitude 49&deg;. 10&Prime;.</P>

<P>The northern part, which includes the ancient Idumea, and is &s;ubject to the Turks, is barren and mountainous, and therefore but thinly inhabited; but the &s;outhern is fertile and well peopled, and governed by its own princes, excepting &s;ome places along the coa&s;t.

<P>Colzum or Kolzom, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Cly&s;ma of Ptolemy, &s;tands at the entrance of the we&s;tern branch or arm of the Red Sea, called from thence by the Arabs the Sea Al-Kolzom, where the city of Heroopolis formerly, and that of Suez, and the ca&s;tle of Adjeroute, now &s;tand.</P>
<P>The we&s;tern branch of the Sea Al-Kolzom, or the Heroopolitan Gulph, is called in Scripture Yam-Suph or Yam-Souph, i. e. the Weedy-Sea. The ingenious Dr. Shaw &s;uppo&s;es it to have been &s;o called from the variety of madrepores, fuci, and other marine vegetables, that grow within its chan|nel, and, when the &s;ea is calm, look like a fore&s;t under water. The &s;ame gulph was al&s;o called the Sea of Edom, by the antient inhabitants of the neighbouring country, who were de&s;cended from Edom or E&s;au, the brother of Jacob.</P>
<P>Other remarkable places in Arabia-Petraea are, 1. The Wilderne&s;s of Paran, extending from that
<PB N="459" REF="4610">
of Shur to Mount Sinai. 2. The wilderne&s;s of Sin or Zin, contiguous to the former, and lying be|tween Mount Sinai and the we&s;tern arm of the Sea Al-Kolzom. In it are many acacia trees, whence comes the gum called by the Arabs acacia. 3. The De&s;ert of Sinai, which is a beautiful plain, more than a league in breadth, and near three in length, lying open towards the north-ea&s;t, where pa&s;&s;engers enter it, but clo&s;ed up to the &s;outhward by &s;ome of the lower eminencies of Mount Sinai. 4. Mounts Ca&s;ius, Sinai, and Horeb. Mount Sinai, where Mo&s;es received the two tables of the law, is called by the Arabs Gibel Mou&s;a, or Mo&s;es's Mountain. All over it are to be &s;een little chapels, with cells, in which, it is &s;aid, no le&s;s than fourteen thou&s;and hermits formerly lived. At the foot of the a&s;cent to it is a fair well-built Greek convent, (&s;ome &s;ay two) &s;urrounded with &s;trong walls. From Mount Sinai we ea&s;ily &s;ee Mount Horeb, where Mo&s;es kept the flocks of Jethro, his father-in-law, when he &s;aw the burning bu&s;h. At the foot of this mountain al&s;o is a Greek mona&s;tery, called St. Sa|viour's, where pilgrims lodge. The church is a very noble edifice, very rich in plate, and finely adorned with &s;culpture, marble, &amp;c. An arch|bi&s;hop re&s;ides here, who&s;e ve&s;tments much re&s;em|ble tho&s;e of the old Jewi&s;h high-prie&s;ts. The monks are kept under a very &s;trict di&s;cipline, and obliged to work, except when at prayers. The garden of the convent produces all the fruits proper to the climate, as grapes, figs, olives, peaches, almonds, dates, &amp;c. With regard to the la&s;t of the&s;e trees, it is &s;aid, that if the male and female are not plant|ed clo&s;e together they will not bear fruit; but others a&s;&s;ure us, that the female may be made to bear, by taking the blo&s;&s;oms of the male and put|ting them into the heart of it, at the top of the &s;tem, without which the fruit will drop before it is half
<PB N="460" REF="4620">
ripe. The convent is well &s;upplied with water from a &s;pring on the mount. The monks here and on Mount Sinai pretend to &s;hew you the places where Mo&s;es fa&s;ted forty days, and received the two ta|bles of &s;tone; where the I&s;raelites wor&s;hipped the golden calf; the rock out of which Mo&s;es brought water, by &s;triking it with his rod; a grotto, where they pretend Mo&s;es was hid when he de&s;ired to &s;ee the face of God, and &s;aw but his back parts; and, to name no more, a &s;tone where, they &s;ay, the pro|phet Elijah &s;at him&s;elf down, when he fled from Je|zebel. The vallies about Mounts Sinai and Ho|reb abound with ca&s;&s;ia trees, which yield the frank|incen&s;e; others, which bear a kind of wool like cotton, but neither &s;o fine nor &s;o white; and others, who&s;e flowers and leaves have a fine fragrant &s;mell. Some very large &s;erpents are bred in the&s;e parts, and great numbers of o&s;triches, which, tho' they cannot fly, yet, with the help of their wings, run &s;o fa&s;t that a hor&s;e cannot overtake them; howe|ver, they are &s;oon tired: in their flight, they throw &s;tones backwards upon tho&s;e who pur&s;ue them.</P>
<P>The &s;everal tribes of Arabs here have each an em&icirc;r, under whom are &s;even &s;hieks, who pre&s;ide over a certain number of captains or heads of fami|lies, and admini&s;ter ju&s;tice. When any of the cap|tains die, the family chu&s;es another from among them&s;elves, and pre&s;ent him to the &s;hiek for his approbation; and, if the &s;hiek dies without &s;ons, the families over which he pre&s;ided chu&s;e a new one to &s;ucceed him; and, when an em&icirc;r dies without &s;ons, the whole tribe chu&s;es a new one. Their weapons are lances, &s;cimitars, long daggers, and bucklers, made of the &s;kins of fi&s;h. No army can pur&s;ue them without danger of peri&s;hing, either by hun|ger, thir&s;t, or tempe&s;ts of &s;and; or of being con|tinually galled by them from the rocky mountains and narrow pa&s;&s;es. Not only the caravans, but
<PB N="461" REF="4630">
the Turki&s;h ba&s;&s;as, are obliged to purcha&s;e their forbearance of ho&s;tilities and depredations. The women are clad only in a light loo&s;e gown, like our women's &s;hifts. The men wear drawers, with ve&s;ts of &s;heep &s;kins, and turn the wool outward in hot weather. Their tents are made of goats &s;kins, and very &s;lovenly. They live chiefly upon the milk of their camels and &s;mall cattle; and their greate&s;t dainty is a kind of cake, baked on the coals, and mixed with butter and honey. Their hor&s;es are very &s;wift, and their camels much more &s;o.</P>

<HEAD>ARABIA-FELIX,</HEAD>
<P>Which is by far the large&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;idera|ble of the three, was antiently called Saba, Sabea, and Seba, from Seba the &s;on of Cu&s;h, and grand|&s;on of Ham; and afterwards got the epithet of Felix, from its extraordinary fertility, compared to the other Arabias.</P>
<P>It is bounded on the north by Petraea and De|&s;erta; on the &s;outh by the Indian Ocean, or Ara|bian Sea; on the ea&s;t by the gulphs of Per&s;ia and Ormus; and on the we&s;t by the Red Sea. Some of the Ea&s;tern writers divide it into five provinces, viz. A&s;aman, Hejaz, Tehama, Najd, and Yaina|ma; which others reduce to two, Yainau and Hejaz, the la&s;t including the three provinces of Tehama, Najd, and Yamama.</P>
<P>This country is wonderfully extolled by the an|tients for its fertility and produce. According to them, it yielded frankincen&s;e, myrrh, aloes, &s;pike|nard, cinnamon, ca&s;&s;ia, cedar, and other oderife|rous woods; medicinal &s;hrubs, herbs, gums, and drugs; corn, wine, oil, and the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite fruits and &s;pices of all &s;orts; gold and &s;ilver, be|&s;ides
<PB N="462" REF="4640">
ba&s;er metals, and minerals; diamonds, ru|bies, &s;ardonixes, and other precious &s;tones; and the neighbouring &s;eas abounded with pearls, and a great variety of &s;hells. If this account was really true, and not taken upon tru&s;t, the country mu&s;t have undergone a great alteration &s;ince they wrote; for, at pre&s;ent, no &s;uch fecundity appears, except in a few &s;pots here and there, which bear but a &s;mall proportion to the re&s;t. The inland parts are mo&s;tly &s;andy, mountainous, and barren; and the only places that can be called fertile, at pre&s;ent, are the &s;ea-coa&s;ts, and the lands on the banks of the rivers. Frankincen&s;e is now found only in the pro|vince of Shihr, in the kingdom of Yaman, in which kingdom al&s;o the coffee-trees only grow at pre|&s;ent.</P>
<P>The chief of the antient nations, or tribes, which inhabited this country were the Sabaei, Gerraei, Minaei, Adramitae, Maranitae, Catabani, A&s;atae, Sapphoritae, Omanitae, Nabathaeans or Saracens, Thamydeni, and Bnezomen.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent, as we ob&s;erved above, the be&s;t Ea&s;tern writers divide this penin&s;ula into five pro|provinces or kingdoms, viz. Yaman, Hejaz, Te|hama, Najd, and Yamama.</P>
<P>The province of Yaman, &s;o called either from its &s;ituation to the right hand or &s;outh of the temple of Mecca, or el&s;e from the happine&s;s and verdure of its &s;oil, extends it&s;elf along the Indian Ocean, from the Straights of Bab-al-Mandab to Cape Ra&s;-al-Ghat. Part of the Red Sea bounds it on the we&s;t; as the towns of Najran, the Negara, of Ptolemy, Haly or Haljo, on the Sea Al-Kolzom, and Oman or Sohar, do on the north. It is &s;ubdi|vided into &s;everal le&s;&s;er provinces, as Hadramaut, Shihr, Oman, Mahra, &amp;c. of which Shihr alone produces the frankincen&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="463" REF="4650">
This country hath been famous from all anti|quity for its fertility, riches and the happine&s;s of its climate. The principal towns are the follow|ing,</P>
<P>Mokha or Mocho, by &s;ome &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Mu&s;a or Muza of Ptolomy. It is a port and town on the Red Sea, of con&s;iderable trade; con|tains about ten thou&s;and inhabitants, Jews, Arme|nians, and Mohammedans, is &s;urrounded with walls after the antient manner, and has four gates, and four towers, the la&s;t mounted with cannon, but no ditch. It gives name to a kingdom extend|ing along the mo&s;t &s;outhern coa&s;t of Arabia; of which that part which lies next the &s;ea is a dry bar|ren de&s;ert, in &s;ome places ten or twelve leagues over; but bounded by mountains, which being well watered, enjoy an almo&s;t perpetual &s;pring; and be&s;ides coffee, the peculiar produce of this coun|try, yields corn, grapes, myrrh, frankincen&s;e, ca&s;|&s;ia, balm, gums of &s;everal &s;orts, mangos, dates, pomegranates, &amp;c. The weather here is &s;o hot and &s;ultry in &s;ummer, e&s;pecially when the &s;outh wind blows, that it would be in&s;upportable, if it was not mitigated by the cool breezes that general|ly blow from the mountains on the north, or the Red and Arabic Seas on the we&s;t and ea&s;t. The heat in winter is equal to that of our warme&s;t &s;um|mers, and it is very &s;eldom that either clouds or rain are &s;een. The city of Mocha is now the em|porium for the trade of all India to the Red Sea. The trade was removed hither from Aden, in con|&s;equence of the prophecy of a &s;heik, much revered by the people, who foretold, that it would &s;oon become a place of exten&s;ive commerce, notwith|&s;tanding its di&s;advantageous &s;ituation. It &s;tands clo&s;e to the &s;ea, in a large, dry, and &s;andy plain, that affords no good water within twenty miles of
<PB N="464" REF="4660">
the city; what they drink comes from Mo&s;a, and co&s;ts as dear as &s;mall beer in England. The water near the town, as it is thought, produces a worm, which the naturali&s;ts call the dracunculus, which is about two feet and a half long, very &s;lender, and breeds in the fle&s;hy parts of the body: in extract|ing it great care mu&s;t be u&s;ed, the con&s;equence be|ing dangerous if any part of it remains in the body. The buildings here are lofty, and tolerably regular, having a plea&s;ant a&s;pect from Mecca. The &s;teeples of &s;everal mo&s;ques are very high, pre|&s;enting them&s;elves to view at a great di&s;tance. Their markets are well &s;tored with beef, mutton, lamb, kid, camels, and antelopes fle&s;h, common fowls, Guinea hens, partridges, and pigeons. The &s;ea affords plenty of fi&s;h, but not &s;avoury; which &s;ome think proceeds from the extreme &s;altne&s;s of the water, and the nature of their aliment. The markets are al&s;o &s;tocked with fruit, &s;uch as grapes, peaches, apricots, quinces, and nectarines; al|though neither &s;hrub nor tree is to be &s;een near the town, except a few date trees. Frequently no rain falls here in two or three years, and &s;eldom more than a &s;hower or two in a year; but in the mountains, at the di&s;tance of about twenty miles from Mokha, the earth is watered with a gentle &s;hower every morning, which makes the vallies fertile in corn, and the fruits natural to the cli|mate. The Arab inhabitants, though remarkably grave and &s;uper&s;titious, are &s;aid to be extremely co|vetous and hypocritical; robbing, thieving, and committing piracy, without the lea&s;t &s;cruple or remor&s;e. The Engli&s;h and Dutch companies have hand&s;ome hou&s;es here, and carry on a great trade in coffee, olibanum, myrrh, aloes, liquid &s;torax, white and yellow ar&s;enic, gum Arabic, mummy, balm of Gilead, and other drugs.

however, they &s;u&s;tain from the violence and exactions of the Arabian princes; but the king's cu&s;toms are ea&s;y, being fixed at three per cent. to Europeans. Of the coins at Mocha, the mo&s;t current is the cama&s;&s;ie, which ri&s;es and falls in value at the banker's di&s;cretion: they are from fif|ty to eighty for a current dollar, which is but an imaginary &s;pecies, being always reckoned one and a half per cent. lower than Spani&s;h dollars. As to their weights, they are almo&s;t infinite, accord|ing to the nature of the thing to be weighed: they have the banian weight; the magiet; the am|bergri&s;e; the agala; the gold and &s;ilver weights; &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Aden, a celebrated mart on the Indian Ocean, in the kingdom of Mocha, not far from the Straits of Bab al Mandab, &s;o called, according to the A|rabs, from its founder Aden, the &s;on of Saba, and grand&s;on of Abraham. Some believe the name to be the &s;ame with Eden, the Hebrew word denoting paradi&s;e; and that it was given the town from the delightful country in which it is &s;ituated. It &s;tands at the foot of &s;everal high mountains, which &s;ur|round it almo&s;t on all &s;ides. The Arabs have erected five or &s;ix forts on the &s;ummits of the&s;e mountains, with curtains, and many other fortifi|cations, to guard the pa&s;&s;es from the inland. A fair aqueduct extends from thence to a great canal or re&s;ervoir, built about three quarters of a mile from the city, which &s;upplies the inhabi|tants with very good water. It is thought to be the Arabi Emporium of Ptolemy contains about &s;ix thou&s;and inhabitans, is well fortified, and &s;tands about an hundred and twenty miles &s;outh-ea&s;t of Mocha, to who&s;e king it is &s;ubject; though we are told by &s;ome, that both belong to the king of Yaman.</P>
<P><PB N="466" REF="4680">
Sanaa, the capital of Yaman, a very antient city, greatly re&s;embling Dama&s;cus. It is &s;ituated in a mountainous territory, about fifty leagues from Mocha, on the borders of Hadramaut, and ble&s;&s;ed with a mo&s;t delightful air, enjoying a &s;ort of per|petual &s;pring. According to the Arabs, its pre|&s;ent name was derived from Sanaa, the &s;on of Oz&acirc;l, the &s;on of Joktan; but it formerly bore the name of Oz&acirc;l, and is thought to be the Saphar of Ptole|my. Towards the beginning of the la&s;t century, it con&s;i&s;ted of good hou&s;es, built of lime and &s;tone, and was about the bigne&s;s of Bri&s;tol. It &s;tands in a barren &s;tony valley, &s;urrounded, at a &s;mall di&s;|tance, with high hills, one of which overlooks the town to the northward. On this hill, the Arabs have built a &s;mall ca&s;tle to keep off the moun|taineers, who often annoy the city. The inhabi|tants have no water but what they receive from wells, which are very deep. Wood is brought from far, and is con&s;equently very dear. On the ea&s;t &s;ide &s;tands the ca&s;tle, environed with mud walls, flanked with towers and redoubts, in which every night are placed proper guards. The king of Yaman does not re&s;ide here now, but at Muab, not a mile from Dhamar, a little to the &s;outh-ea&s;t of Sanaa.</P>
<P>Mareb, in the province of Hadramaut, near the coa&s;t of the Indian Ocean, about three days jour|ney from Sanaa, towards the ea&s;t. It is &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome to be the antient Saba, or Sabae, the capi|tal of the country of the Sabaei, and the re&s;idence of the queen of Sheba. At pre&s;ent it is little bet|ter than a village.</P>
<P>Xiban or Shibam, one of the principal towns of Hadramaut, which goes likewi&s;e under the name of Hadramaut among the Arabs, and con&s;equently gives name to the province. It &s;tands about a day's journey, or twenty-four miles, from the In|dian

<P>Tezim, another of the principal towns of Hadra|maut, about the &s;ame di&s;tance from the Indian Ocean as Shebam. Both the&s;e towns took their names from the tribes who founded and &s;ettled in them.</P>
<P>Dhafar, a con&s;iderable town in Shirhr, the only province of Arabia bearing frankincen&s;e, on the coa&s;t of the Indian Ocean, about fifteen miles from Merbat. It is &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome to be the &s;ame with the antient Sapphar, or Saphar; and the territory of Shirhr, or at lea&s;t the mountainous part of it, the &s;ame as that called by Mo&s;es Mount Sephar.</P>
<P>Sohar, called al&s;o Om&acirc;n, the capital of a terri|tory di&s;tingui&s;hed by the latter of the&s;e names, and &s;tretching three hundred miles on the coa&s;t of the Per&s;ian Sea, which is there called the Sea of Om&acirc;n. It is thought to be the Omanum of Pto|lemy, and was formerly much frequented by mer|chants, but has been long de&s;erted by them. Not far from it is the i&s;le of Charec, famous for a pearl fi&s;hery, according to Abulfeda. The town lies in about 24&deg;. north latitude. The heats in Om&acirc;n are frequently &s;o inten&s;e, that they have pa&s;&s;ed into a proverb among the Orientals. There are many other towns in Yaman, as Masfa, not far from the &s;ource of the river Falj, which empties it|&s;elf into the Bay of Ba&s;rah; C&acirc;dhema, the Itamas Portus of the antients, on the &s;ame bay; Mo&s;a, a &s;mall but hand&s;ome town, near ten leagues from Mocha; Ma&s;chal, the Mo&s;cha Portus of Pto|lemy, on the Bay of Ormus, a little above a degree north of the extremity of Cape Ra&s;-al-Ghat,

<P>Hejaz, &s;o named either becau&s;e it divides Najd from Tehama, or becau&s;e it is &s;urrounded with mountains, is bounded on the &s;outh by Yaman and Tehama; on the we&s;t by the Sea Al-Kolzom; on the north by the De&s;erts of Sham or Syria; and on the ea&s;t by the province of Najd.</P>
<P>The &s;oil of Hejaz, as well as that of Najd, Te|hama, and Yamama, is much more barren than that of Yaman, the greater part of the&s;e territories being covered with dry &s;ands, or ri&s;ing into rocks, inter&s;per&s;ed here and there with fruitful &s;pots, well watered, and abounding with palm-trees. The towns in this province worth mentioning are,</P>
<P>Mecca, celebrated for its temple, and for having given birth to Mohammed. It is a very hand&s;ome city, and is &s;ometimes called Becca, which, as well as Mecca, &s;ignifies a place of great intercour&s;e. Some authors imagine it to be the Me&s;a or Me&s;ha of the Scripture, and that it derived that name from one of I&s;hmael's &s;ons. It &s;tands in a barren valley, &s;urrounded on all &s;ides with mountains, about forty-two miles ea&s;t from that part of the Red Sea called by the Arabs the Sea Al-Kolzom. The Turks call it Ommal Kora, or the Mother of Cities. The length of it is &s;aid to be about two miles, and the breadth one. There being no &s;prings in the town, at lea&s;t none but &s;uch as are bitter and unfit to drink, except the well Zemzem, which the Arabs highly venerate, as believing it to be the &s;ame which the angel pointed out to Hagar, in behalf of her &s;on I&s;hmael; but which cannot be drank for any continuance, being &s;omewhat bracki&s;h, and cau&s;ing eruptions in tho&s;e who drink plentifully of it, the inhabitants u&s;e rain water, which they catch in ci&s;terns, or that which is brought by two
<PB N="469" REF="4710">
aqueducts. All the Mohammedans that come to Mecca drink of the well Zemzem, and attribute many &s;trange virtues to it. The &s;oil about the city is very barren; but without the bounds of its ter|ritory are many good &s;prings, and &s;treams of run|ning water, with gardens, and cultivated lands. The prince, or &s;har&icirc;f of Mecca has a garden, well planted, at his ca&s;tle of Marbaa, about three miles we&s;tward from the city, where he u&s;ually re&s;ides. This prince is lineally de&s;cended from Ha&s;hem, Mohammed's great-grandfather. The mo&s;t pow|erful Mohammedan princes pay the greate&s;t ve|neration, both to him and the &s;harif of Medina, who is al&s;o a de&s;cendant of the prophet's, and the places under their dominion often &s;ending them of|ferings, and valuable pre&s;ents. The people of Mecca, having no corn nor grain of their own growth, are &s;upplied by two caravans, which &s;et out yearly; one in &s;ummer, and another in winter. They have plenty of dates from the adjacent coun|try, and grapes from Tayef, a town about &s;ixty miles di&s;tant. They have al&s;o great numbers of cattle, particularly camels. Al-Caabah, or the Holy Hou&s;e or Chapel, which the Arabs &s;ay was fir&s;t built by Adam, but being de&s;troyed by the Deluge, was, by the command of God, rebuilt by Abraham and I&s;hmael, and the latter buried near it, &s;tands in the centre of Al-Kharam, or the Great Temple, which is exceeding lofty and mag|nificent, being three hundred and &s;eventy cubits long, three hundred and fifteen broad, and &s;up|ported by four hundred and thirty-four pillars. Some authors tell us, that this temple is begirt with two belts of gold, one near the bottom, and ano|ther near the top; that the door is of &s;ilver; and that the water is carried off from the roof by a golden &s;pout. The Arabs have a tradition, that I&s;hmael, with his mother Hagar, fixed his re&s;idence

A great many &s;illy, ridiculous, &s;uper&s;titious, cere|monies, are performed by the pilgrims, particularly the proce&s;&s;ion round the temple, which we have not room here to de&s;cribe. The &s;har&icirc;f of Mecca's troops con&s;i&s;t entirely of infantry, which the Arabs call al-harrabah, i. e. the archers or dartmen.

<P>Medina, a city celebrated for being the place where Mohammed re&s;ided the la&s;t ten years of his life, and was interred at his death. Before his retreat hither, the city was called Yathreb. It &s;tands about ten days journey, or two hundred and fifty miles, north of Mecca, and about thirty-five miles from the Red Sea, in a plain &s;urrounded with a brick wall, and enjoys a whole&s;ome air. It is about half as big as Mecca, and is thought to be the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> of Stephanus, and the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> of Ptolemy. In &s;ome places, its territory produces dates and other fruits; and, in others, &s;alt and &s;al&s;uginous plants. The name Yathreb was derived from the chief of the tribe, which fir&s;t &s;ettled there, whom the Arabs make the great-grand&s;on of Aram. Chri&s;tians mu&s;t not come near this city, nor that of Mecca, on pain of being burnt alive. Here Mo|hammed lies interred in a magnificent building,
<PB N="471" REF="4730">
covered with a cupola, and adjoining to the ea&s;t &s;ide of the great temple, which is built in the mid&s;t of the city. Many tombs of the principal per&s;ons of the prophet's family, of his chief do|me&s;tics, followers, &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and companions, are al&s;o to be &s;een here; particularly, tho&s;e of Abu Becr, and Omar. The mo&s;ques and oratories of Medina, &s;ome of which are very magnificent, amount to about thirty in number. Within the city are &s;everal famed wells, e&s;pecially that called Aris, in which the prophet is &s;aid to have &s;pat, and his &s;eal to have fallen from the hand of Othm&acirc;n Ebn Affan. The Mohammedans enter|tain the mo&s;t exalted &s;entiments of the nobility and excellency of this place; particularly of the &s;pot where the prophet's mo&s;que and tomb &s;tands, which they look upon as the mo&s;t re&s;pectable place in the world. The pilgrimage to, or vi&s;itation of, Mohammed's tomb, is accounted a work of great merit, e&s;pecially if any favourable opportunity of doing it offers, though it be not expre&s;ly enjoined by any po&s;itive command. Mohammed conferred &s;ome very &s;ingular privileges upon the inhabitants of this city, as well as upon all the mo&s;lems, who &s;hould at any time perform their devotions in his mo&s;que. The pilgrims ob&s;erve a great many ri|diculous ceremonies here, as at Mecca, which are not worth particularizing. Every mu&s;&s;elman who hath vi&s;ited the&s;e places, is ever after regarded as a &s;aint. The mo&s;que in which is Mohammed's tomb, and which, on that account, is &s;tiled the Mo&s;t Holy, is a very magnificent &s;tructure, &s;up|ported by four hundred &s;tately columns, and em|belli&s;hed with three hundred rich lamps, which are kept continually burning. It hath a &s;mall tower, covered with plates of &s;ilver, as the floor is with cloth of gold, &s;tands in the middle of the city, and is the mo&s;t re&s;orted to of any, next to that of Mecca. In one of its angles is the
<PB N="472" REF="4740">
prophet's tomb of white marble, under a cupola enriched with precious &s;tones of immen&s;e value, e&s;pecially that part of it which is over his head. Over the feet likewi&s;e of the coffin is a rich gold cre&s;cent, curiou&s;ly wrought, and adorned with pre|cious &s;tones. Mohammed's coffin is &s;aid to be covered with a rich pall of gold and &s;ilver ti&s;&s;ue, under a canopy of the &s;ame precious cloth, &s;ent hither annually by the ba&s;&s;a of Egypt, by order of the grand &s;eignior. The camel which carries it, derives a &s;ort of &s;anctity from it, and is never to be u&s;ed in any drudgery afterwards. The vul|gar notion of the coffins being &s;u&s;pended between two magnets has no foundation. Some authors make the longitude of Medina to be 67&deg;. 30&prime;. and others 65&deg;. 20&prime;. ea&s;t, and its latitude either 24&deg;. or 25&deg;. north.</P>
<P>Thaifa, or Taifa, or Al-Tayef, a town &s;ituated in a fruitful territory, about &s;ixty miles or three &s;tations to the ea&s;t of Mecca, behind Mount Gaz|wan, where the cold is more inten&s;e than in any other part of Hejaz, but the air very whole&s;ome. Its territory abounds in fountains, and produces excellent rai&s;ins. The town is &s;urrounded with a wall, but is not very large.</P>
<P>Gjudda, or Jodda, a large well built &s;ea-port town, about forty-two miles we&s;t of Mecca, of which it may be reckoned the key and bulwark. It is a place of great trade, and immediately &s;ubject to the Turks, who keep a ba&s;ha in it.

<P>Yanbo, or Al-Yanbo, a &s;mall city, &s;ituated on the we&s;tern coa&s;t of Arabia-Felix, not far from the &s;ea, on the road to Al-Medinah. It is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Jambia of Ptolomy, and has a ca&s;tle,

<P>Hejr, or Al-Hhegr, the Egra, or Agra of Pliny, and Stephanus, and the capital of a di&s;trict in the country of Hejaz. It &s;tands amid&s;t a ridge of rocky mountains, in latitude 28&deg;. 30&prime;. north, not far from the coa&s;ts of the Red Sea.</P>
<P>Madian, the Modiana of Ptolomy, and the Midi|an, or Madian of &s;cripture, &s;ituated on the ea&s;tern &s;hore of the &s;ea Al-Kolzom, at no great di&s;tance from the gulph of Ailah: at pre&s;ent it is little better than a heap of ruins. Reuel, or Reguel, or Jethro, Mo&s;es's father-in-law, was prince and prie&s;t of this city and tribe. Abul&s;eda &s;ays, the well where Mo&s;es, or as the Arabs call him, Mou&s;a, wa|tered Jethro's flocks, was &s;till remaining, when he wrote his Geographical De&s;cription of Arabia.</P>
<P>Tehama is a &s;mall province, bounded on the we&s;t by the Red Sea; and on the other &s;ides by Hejaz and Yaman, extending almo&s;t from Mecca to Aden. According to Golius it derived the name of Tehama from its &s;andy &s;oil, as it did ano|ther, to wit, Gaur, from its low &s;ituation; but it is probable it had the fir&s;t from Tema the &s;on of I&s;h|mael. Abulfeda mentions &s;everal towns in it, of which Tebala, the principal, built by Tebala the &s;on of Midian, &s;tands in the road from Mecca to Sanaa, the capital of Yaman, and is a place of con|&s;iderable note.</P>
<P>The province of Najd, which word &s;ignifies a ri&s;ing ground, lies between tho&s;e of Yamama, Yaman, and Hejaz, and is bounded on the ea&s;t by Ir&acirc;k. It is much more mountainous than Te|hama; and this is all that we can affirm concerning it, with any degree of certainty, no account, that can be depended upon, having ever been given of it.</P>
<P><PB N="474" REF="4760">
Yamama, called al&s;o Arud, is encompa&s;&s;ed by Najd, Tehama, Bahrein, Oman, Shihr, Hadra|maut and Saba. The chief city is Yam&acirc;ma, which gives name to the province, and was antiently called Jaw, or Gjauva. It lies four degrees to the ea&s;t of Mecca, and derived its name either from a river, or fountain, or a queen &s;o called. The fal&s;e prophet Mo&s;eilama, Mohammed's competitor, rendered this place famous by re&s;iding in it; but he being vanqui&s;hed and killed, it &s;ubmitted to Abubecr.</P>
<P>Bahrein, which &s;ome oriental geographers make a part of Ir&acirc;k, in its mo&s;t exten&s;ive acceptation, denotes that maritime tract lying between the city of Ba&s;ra, Ba&s;&s;ora, or Bal&s;ora, &s;ituate near the Eu|phrates, and the furthe&s;t limits of Om&acirc;n; to which the Arabs have given the name of Bahrein, i. e. of two &s;eas, or the country of two &s;eas, be|cau&s;e it connects the Per&s;ian Gulph with the In|dian Ocean. In a more confined &s;en&s;e it is ap|plied to an i&s;land, or rather two, of the Per&s;ian, Gulph, in 26&deg;. 30&prime;. north latitude, about a league from the town of Al-Katif, which is &s;eated on that Gulph, &s;ix days journey from Ba&s;rah, is a place of trade, and gives name to a large principality now belonging to the Turks. There are &s;everal other towns in Bahrein, of which one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable is called J&ucirc;lf&acirc;r.</P>
<P>Having often mentioned caravans in our de|&s;cription of Turky in A&s;ia, and Arabia, it will not be improper here to give a more particular account of them. A caravan then &s;ignifies a com|pany or a&s;&s;embly of travellers and pilgrims, and more particularly of merchants, who for their greater &s;ecurity, and in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t each other, travel together thro' the de&s;erts, and other dan|gerous places, which are infe&s;ted with Arabs or robbers. In order to form a caravan, it is nece&s;|&s;ary
<PB N="475" REF="4770">
to have the permi&s;&s;ion in writing of the prince in who&s;e dominions it is to be formed, and of tho&s;e thro' who&s;e dominions it is to pa&s;s. The&s;e per|mi&s;&s;ions expre&s;s the number of men and carriages, and the merchandizes which are to compo&s;e the caravan, and the merchants to whom the caravan belongs, appoint its officers, and regulate every thing relating to its police and government dur|ing the march.</P>
<P>There are commonly four principal officers, namely the caravanbachi, or head of the caravan; the captain of the march; the captain of &s;tay or re&s;t; and the captain of the di&s;tribution. The fir&s;t has the uncontroulable command and authority over all others, and gives them his orders; the &s;econd is ab&s;olute during the march; the third exerts his authority only when the caravan &s;tops and encamps in &s;ome place; the fourth orders the di&s;po&s;ition of every part of the caravan, in ca&s;e of an attack or battle. This military officer has al&s;o, during the march, the in&s;pection over the di&s;tri|bution of the provi&s;ions, which is conducted under his management by &s;everal inferior officers, who are obliged to give &s;ecurity to the ma&s;ter of the caravan, each of them having the care of a certain number of men, elephants, dromedaries, camels, &amp;c. which they undertake to conduct, and fur|ni&s;h with provi&s;ions at their own ri&s;que, according to the agreement &s;tipulated. A fifth officer of the caravan, is the payma&s;ter or trea&s;urer, who has under him a great many clerks and interpreters, appointed to keep accurate journals, of whatever happens; and it is by the&s;e journals, &s;igned by the &s;uperior officers, that the owners of the cara|van judge whether they have been well or ill &s;erved or conducted. Another kind of officers are the Arabian mathematicians, without whom no cara|van will pre&s;ume to &s;et out: there are commonly
<PB N="476" REF="4780">
three of them in the large caravans. The&s;e offi|cers perform the functions both of quarter-ma&s;ters and aid-decamp, leading the troops when the cara|van is attacked, and a&s;&s;igning the quarters where the caravan is appointed to encamp.</P>
<P>Five &s;orts of caravans are generally di&s;tingui&s;h|ed; the heavy caravans, compo&s;ed of elephants, dromedaries, camels and hor&s;es; the light cara|vans, which have but few elephants; the common caravans, where there are none of the&s;e animals; and the hor&s;e caravan, in which there are neither dromedaries nor camels; and la&s;tly the &s;ea cara|vans, con&s;i&s;ting of a number of merchant &s;hips, under the convoy of &s;ome men of war: whence it may be ob&s;erved, that the idea of a caravan is not &s;o entirely re&s;trained to the land, but that there may be al&s;o marine caravans.</P>
<P>The proportion ob&s;erved in the heavy caravan is as follows: when there are five hundred elephants, they add a thou&s;and dromedaries, and two thou&s;and hor&s;es at lea&s;t; and then the e&s;cort is compo&s;ed of four thou&s;and men on hor&s;eback. Two men are required for leading one elephant, five for three dromedaries, and &s;even for eleven camels. This multitude of &s;ervants, together with the officers and the pa&s;&s;engers, who&s;e number is not fixed, &s;erve to &s;upport the e&s;cort, in ca&s;e of a fight, and render the caravan more formidable, and con&s;e|quently more &s;ecure. The pa&s;&s;engers indeed, are not, according to the laws and u&s;ages of this mer|cantile cavalcade, obliged to fight; but in ca&s;e of refu&s;ing to do &s;o, they are not entitled to any pro|vi&s;ions whatever from the caravan, even tho' they &s;hould pay an extra price for them.</P>
<P>The officers and &s;ervants are paid every Monday, unle&s;s it be a new or full moon, in which ca&s;e the payment is put off till next day: they begin with paying the meane&s;t of the &s;ervants.</P>
<P><PB N="477" REF="4790">
Every elephant is mounted by what they call a nick, that is a lad nine or ten years old, brought up to that exerci&s;e, which drives the elephant, and pricks it now and then, in order to animate it in a fight. The &s;ame lad loads al&s;o the fire-arms of two &s;oldiers, who mount the elephant with him. The day appointed for &s;etting out is never altered.</P>
<P>In order the better to bear the great heat, the traders u&s;e drawers and &s;tockings made of a &s;ort of cotton, extracted, as &s;ome travellers tell us, from that kind of &s;tone, which the antients called ami|anthus, which being duly beaten and prepared, is proper to be &s;pun, and is &s;aid to be incombu&s;tible.</P>
<P>As mo&s;t of the Arabian princes have no other means to &s;ub&s;i&s;t but by their robberies, they keep &s;pies, who give them notice when the caravans &s;et out, which they &s;ometimes attack with &s;uperior force and overpower, plundering them of all their trea&s;ure, and making &s;laves of the whole convoy, except the foreigners, to whom they generally &s;hew more mercy. If they are repul&s;ed, they common|ly come to &s;ome agreement, the conditions of which are pretty well ob&s;erved, e&s;pecially if the a&s;&s;ailants are natives of Arabia. The taking of one caravan only is &s;ometimes enough to enrich the&s;e princes.</P>
<P>As the plague rages very often in the ea&s;t, they are obliged to u&s;e great precautions, to prevent the caravan from carrying that dreadful di&s;temper into the places thro' which they pa&s;s, or from be|ing them&s;elves infected with it. When therefore they arrive near a town, the inhabitants and people of the caravan have a &s;olemn conference concern|ing the &s;tate of their health, and very &s;incerely communicate to each other the &s;tate of the ca&s;e, and if there be really any danger to fear on either &s;ide. When there is ju&s;t rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect any contagious di&s;temper, they amicably agree that no
<PB N="478" REF="4800">
communication whatever &s;hall be &s;uffered between them; and if the caravan &s;tands in need of pro|vi&s;ions, they are conveyed to them with the utmo&s;t precaution over the walls of the town.</P>
<P>The profits made by the commerce of the&s;e cara|vans, whil&s;t upon the march, are very extraor|dinary, and this is what engages a great number of per&s;ons to join with the caravans, and renders the toil and inconveniences of the journey le&s;s in|&s;upportable; and indeed the&s;e fatigues are not &s;mall. The&s;e travelling merchants mu&s;t re&s;olve to accept every where &s;uch provi&s;ions, and other conveniences, as they find, and not permit delicacy and ea&s;e to get the better of their de&s;ire of hone&s;t gain by &s;uch traffic. A trader mu&s;t, like an he|roic general, not mind the frightful confu&s;ion of languages and nations, the fatigues of long march|es, and the exorbitant duties and impo&s;ts paid at certain places; neither mu&s;t he regard the auda|cious robberies, and &s;ubtle tricks, to which he can|not help being expo&s;ed, among that multitude of vagabonds, who frequent the caravans, with no other view but to live at the expence of the weak and incautious. The&s;e la&s;t inconveniences indeed may be prevented, at lea&s;t with regard to the mo&s;t pre|cious merchandizes, by putting them into the &s;trong trunks of the caravan, which, like many in Europe, have a variety of curious locks, that cannot be opened but by tho&s;e who know the knack of them.</P>
<P>A great many caravans, &s;ome more &s;ome le&s;s numerous, &s;et out from Erzerum, the capital of that part of Armenia, which is under the do|minion of the grand &s;eignior. Some of them con|&s;i&s;t of Armenians only, as tho&s;e which carry &s;ilks to Tocat and Con&s;tantinople: the&s;e commonly &s;et out in September.</P>

The caravans of Siberia, at pre&s;ent enter the territories of China, by Selingin&s;koy, &s;ituated in the 52&deg;. of north latitude, on the ea&s;tern bank of the river Selinga, by virtue of a treaty of com|merce concluded not many years ago between Ru&s;&s;ia and the emperor of China; whereas for|merly they u&s;ed to pa&s;s thro' Nerzin&s;koy and Ar|gun. There are &s;ea caravans from Con&s;tantinople for Alexandria in Egypt.</P>
<P>The caravan of Nubia, goes twice a year into Egypt. It pa&s;&s;es thro' Gary, a place on the left bank of the Nile, three or four days journey on this &s;ide of Dongola. There the merchants of Sannar, the capital of Fungi; tho&s;e of Gondar, the capital of Ethiopia, and many others from di|vers parts of Africa meet, at a certain time, when they know the caravan is to arrive. Then &s;etting out from Gary, the caravan leaves the banks of the Nile, and cro&s;&s;ing the de&s;erts of Lybia, arrives, after a march of thirteen days, in a valley which is thirty leagues long. This valley, which lies al|mo&s;t from north to &s;outh, abounds with palm-trees, and is very well cultivated, becau&s;e good water may be found by digging only one foot deep in the ground. After &s;ome days re&s;t in this valley, the caravan marches a whole day between &s;teep mountains, in an even but narrow road; after which it arrives in a narrow pa&s;s, by which it pa&s;&s;es thro' that chain of mountains running along the Nile on the &s;ide of Lybia, and comes at la&s;t to Manfelout, a town in upper Egypt, where the duties to the prince are paid in black &s;laves, and where the caravan meets the Nile again for the fir&s;t time from its &s;etting out from Gary.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t danger in &s;o difficult a march is, that the caravan being to cro&s;s va&s;t plains of &s;and, where it is impo&s;&s;ible to ob&s;erve or di&s;cover the lea&s;t track of a road, if the guides &s;hould hap|pen
<PB N="480" REF="4820">
to lo&s;e their way in the&s;e de&s;erts, the provi&s;ion of water, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to carry them to the place where they are to find more, mu&s;t infallibly fail them by &s;uch a delay, which is frequently of &s;everal days journey. In &s;uch a ca&s;e the mules and hor&s;es die with fatigue and thir&s;t in the&s;e burning &s;ands; and even the camels, notwith&s;tanding their extra|ordinary power to &s;ub&s;i&s;t without water, &s;oon peri&s;h in the &s;ame manner, together with the people of the caravan, wandering in tho&s;e frightful de&s;erts.</P>
<P>The danger is &s;till infinitely greater, when a &s;outh wind happens to ri&s;e in tho&s;e &s;andy tracts. The lea&s;t damage it occa&s;ions, is to dry up the leather bags, wherein is kept the provi&s;ion of wa|ter for the journey. This wind, to which the Arabs give the epithet of poi&s;oned, often &s;tifles in a moment tho&s;e who have the misfortune to be then travelling: to prevent which, they are obliged to throw them&s;elves immediately on the ground, putting their faces clo&s;e to the burning &s;and, which &s;urrounds them on all &s;ides, and covering their mouths with &s;ome linen for that purpo&s;e, le&s;t by breathing they &s;hould &s;wallow infallible death, which this wind de&s;&s;eminates wherever it extends. Notwith&s;tanding tho&s;e dangers, trade, and the de|&s;ire of gain induce a multitude of people to run tho&s;e hazards.</P>
<P>There arrives likewi&s;e at Cairo, every year, a numerous caravan from Tripoli in Africa, to which the merchants of Algiers, Tunis, and Morocco, join them&s;elves, as well as tho&s;e who would go in pil|grimage to Mecca, tho' devotion is not the only motive of their journey. This caravan is much le&s;s numerous in its return, becau&s;e the greate&s;t part of the&s;e merchants, who went by land, with only money, or very fine merchandizes for &s;ale, having di&s;po&s;ed of their effects at Mecca in buying Indian
<PB N="481" REF="4830">
Judean commodities, which are bulky, embark at Alexandria, and return by &s;ea to Algiers.</P>
<P>Every year al&s;o &s;everal caravans come into E|gypt from Syria; but the time of their arrival and &s;etting out is not fixed. The journey of tho&s;e caravans is not &s;o difficult and &s;o dangerous as of &s;ome others, becau&s;e the de&s;erts, which &s;eparate the&s;e two countries, are cro&s;&s;ed in three days, and there is no &s;carcity of water. They meet even on the road with &s;everal caravan&s;eras, in which the travellers and their cattle are furni&s;hed gratis with all nece&s;&s;aries; &s;o that the&s;e caravans enjoy all po&s;&s;ible conveniencies, e&s;pecially the rich people among them, who neverthele&s;s live very &s;oberly during their journey.</P>
<P>The caravan&s;eras ju&s;t mentioned, are places ap|pointed for receiving and lodging the caravans. They are commonly long &s;quare buildings, in the middle of which there is a very &s;pacious court. Under the arches or piazzas that &s;urround them, there runs a bank or elevation, rai&s;ed &s;ome feet above the ground, where the merchants, and tho&s;e who travel with them in any capacity, take up their lodgings as well as they can, the bea&s;ts of burthen being tied to the foot of the bank: over the gates that lead into the court, there are &s;ometimes little rooms, which the caravan&s;erakeers, or &s;tewards, or keepers of the caravan&s;eras, let out at a very high price, to &s;uch as have a mind to be private.</P>
<P>The caravan&s;eras in the Ea&s;t are &s;omething in the nature of our capital inns in Europe, with this difference however, that in many of the caravan|&s;eras little accommodation or provi&s;ions are met with either for man or bea&s;t, all per&s;ons being obliged to carry almo&s;t every thing with them.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the&s;e buildings are owing to the charity of the Mohammedans; and the greate&s;t lords, out of devotion or vanity, &s;pend prodigious &s;ums in
<PB N="482" REF="4840">
founding them, e&s;pecially if they happen to be in a dry, &s;andy, and de&s;ert place, whither the water is to be conveyed from a great di&s;tance, at a va&s;t expence; for there is never a caravan&s;era with a well or &s;pring of water.</P>
<P>There are few large towns in the ea&s;t, e&s;pecially in the dominions of the grand &s;eignior, the king of Per&s;ia, and the great mogul, but have &s;ome of the&s;e buildings. The caravan&s;eras of Con&s;tanti|nople, I&s;phahan, and Agra, the capitals of the empires of Turky, Per&s;ia, and the Mogul, are the mo&s;t famous, with regard both to ther num|ber and magnificence. In the&s;e the foreign mer|chants have mo&s;t of their warehou&s;es; for in the&s;e three cities there are &s;everal caravan&s;eras, which, be&s;ides the common accommodations, have &s;everal &s;afe and convenient apartments, both for the mer|chants and their merchandizes.</P>
<P>The emperor, Mohammed the Fourth, cau&s;ed &s;uch caravan&s;eras to be built, at &s;ome di&s;tance from one another, between Con&s;tantinople and Dama&s;cus, and appointed con&s;iderable revenues for their main|tenance. There all travellers, whether Chri&s;tians, Jews, or Mohammedans, are equally well re|ceived.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o at Cairo in Egypt very fine cara|van&s;eras, which are always full of merchandizes and people; and as they yield no incon&s;iderable revenue, this is a &s;ufficient motive for the great lords of the country to build them. The Nubians, Aby&s;&s;inians, and other nations of Africa, who re|&s;ort to Cairo, have there each a particular caravan|&s;era, where they always lodge. The &s;ame mu&s;t be ob&s;erved of the merchants of Aleppo, Dama&s;|cus, Con&s;tantinople, and other trading towns. The&s;e caravan&s;eras are e&s;teemed &s;acred dwellings, where it is not permitted to in&s;ult any per&s;on, or to pillage any of the effects which are depo&s;ited there.
<PB N="483" REF="4850">
They even carry their precautions &s;o far as not to &s;uffer any man, who is not married, to lodge there; becau&s;e they are of opinion, that a man who has no wife is more dangerous than another. It is to the intere&s;t of the proprietors of this &s;ort of caravan&s;eras, that travellers are indebted for the good order and &s;ecurity that they meet with in them.</P>
<P>The caravan&s;eras of Schiras and Ca&s;bin, two con&s;iderable towns in Per&s;ia, have al&s;o a very great reputation, and are little inferior to tho&s;e of the capital.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the caravan&s;eras, which in the Ea&s;t &s;erve in&s;tead of great inns, and furni&s;h accommodations for the merchants, there are &s;ome al&s;o at I&s;pahan, which may be &s;tiled bazars, or arched halls, where there are &s;everal &s;hops and warehou&s;es, wherein &s;everal &s;orts of merchandizes, and delicate pieces of workman&s;hip are expo&s;ed to &s;ale in the day-time, and locked up at night; and for which the keep|er of the caravan&s;era an&s;wers in con&s;ideration of a certain fee or perqui&s;ite. He al&s;o keeps an account of all the merchandizes that are &s;old upon tru&s;t; for he is obliged to enter them re|gularly in his regi&s;ter, with the names of the buyers and &s;ellers. He al&s;o is to demand the pay|ment of the &s;ums due to the merchants, for what hath been &s;old in the caravan&s;era, on the &s;ellers paying two per cent.</P>

<PB N="484" REF="4860">
bear heat, and is therefore never worked in June, July, or Augu&s;t.</P>
<P>The Arab-camel, &s;eldom carries above five hun|dred weight, but can endure heat, and will &s;ub&s;i&s;t on the dry thi&s;tles and other plants, which it picks up in the de&s;erts, as it goes along with its bur|then. Some have been known to travel fifteen days without water; but if they are &s;uffered to drink as much as they will, after &s;uch an ab|&s;tinence, it is great odds but the quantity will kill them.</P>
<P>The dromedary is only a high breed of the Arab-camel, from which it differs only in being of a lighter colour, and more elegant make; except that in&s;tead of the &s;olemn walk, to which the others are accu&s;tomed, it paces, and will go as far in one day as they will go in three.</P>
<P>The camel of two bunches is of the Per&s;ian breed, and differs only in this &s;ingle particular from the Arab-camel. The great &s;trength of the&s;e creatures, and their u&s;efulne&s;s as bea&s;ts of burthen, has probably concurred with other cau&s;es to pre|vent the u&s;e of wheel carriages in mo&s;t parts of A&s;ia; for few are to be found there, except a clum&s;y machine u&s;ed to bring large &s;tones from the quarries.</P>

<P>"Mount Sinai, properly &s;o called, cannot be &s;een from Tor, but only the ridge or group of mountains in which it is, and which altogether forms that part of the tongue of land, called in general Mount Sinai. The garden of the monks
<PB N="485" REF="4870">
of Mount Sinai, at Tor or Elim, renders in dates, &amp;c. twenty thou&s;and pia&s;tres per annum, or two thou&s;and five hundred pound.</P>
<P>We cro&s;&s;ed the plain from Tor in about eight hours, and entered the mountains of Sinai. They are of granite of different colours. At the en|trance of the narrow breach, thro' which we pa&s;&s;ed, I &s;aw on a large loo&s;e granite &s;tone, an in&s;cription in unknown characters, given, I think, by Dr. Po|cock, bi&s;hop of O&s;&s;ory; however, as the I&s;raelites had no writing, that we know off, when they pa&s;|&s;ed here, I did not think it of con&s;equence enough to &s;top for: the Arabs told me it was relative to a battle fought here between Arabs; and indeed I do not &s;ee what point of hi&s;tory it can illu&s;trate, be&s;ides there are not above five or &s;ix words. We arrived at the convent of Mount Sinai, after the u&s;ual difficulties mentioned by other travellers, were received as u&s;ual, and &s;aw the u&s;ual places, of which I took the plans as well as elevations. I mu&s;t &s;ay, that the monks were far from owning to me, that they had ever meddled with the print of the foot of Mahomet's camel. I examined it nar|rowly, and no chi&s;&s;el has ab&s;olutely ever touched it; for the coat of the granite is entire, and un|broke in every part; and every body knows, that if the coat of le&s;s hard &s;tones than granite is once de&s;troyed, it never returns. It is a mo&s;t curious lu&s;us naturae, and the Mohometans turn it to their u&s;e.</P>
<P>Meribah is indeed &s;urpri&s;ingly &s;triking. I ex|amined the lips of its mouth, and found that a chi&s;&s;el had never worked there; the channel is plainly worn by only the cour&s;e of water, and the bare in&s;pection of it is &s;ufficient to convince any one, that it is not the work of man. Among&s;t the innumerable cracks of rocks, which I have &s;een in this, as well as other parts of the world, I
<PB N="486" REF="4880">
never met with any like this, except that at Je|ru&s;alem, and the two which are in the rock Mo&s;es &s;truck twice; of which hereafter. I had enquired of the captain and the two pilots of the &s;hip in which I came from Suez to Tor, about Sharme and Dzahab, on the we&s;tern &s;hore of the ea&s;tern branch of the Red Sea. They told me, "that they were often forced up the Elanitic Gulph, or ea&s;tern branch of the Red Sea, and generally went to Sharme, and &s;ometimes as high as Dzahab; that they generally ran from Cape Mohomet, the &s;ou hernmo&s;t part of the penin&s;ula, between tho&s;e two gulphs, to Sharme, in &s;ix hours; becau&s;e they always made as much more way as they common|ly do, they very &s;eldom going there but in a &s;torm. They generally run four knots, &s;o this makes forty-eight miles, which brings it to the northward of Tor. For it is in latitude 27&deg;. 55&prime;. Cape-Mahomet thirty miles &s;outhward, latitude 27&deg;. 25&prime;. Sharme forty-eight miles nearly, north latitude 28&deg;. 13&prime;. con&s;equently about ea&s;t-north-ea&s;t of Sinai. The port is pretty large, &s;urrounded with high mountains, the entrance very narrow, and the water deep quite to the rocks, which are &s;o very &s;teep, that a &s;tone dropt from the &s;ummit falls into the ba&s;on. No wind can be felt there; they don't ca&s;t anchor, but fa&s;ten their cables to the rocks. There is good water; &s;ome habitations are found on the &s;ides of the mountains, and a pretty large village at top: this &s;eems to an&s;wer the idea of Ne&s;t-Ken. Dzahab lies as high again up the gulph, is forty-eight miles more, or in latitude 29&deg;. This port is con&s;iderably larger than the former, and very good, but not &s;o clo&s;ely &s;urrounded with mountains; it is however very &s;afe. There is a well of great antiquity, with very good water, and con&s;iderable ruins; for they &s;ay, there was a great city here formerly, but no inhabitants now, except
<PB N="487" REF="4890">
an Arabian camp, of two thou&s;and men. There is a road from it to Jeru&s;alem, formerly much frequented." Thus far the captain and pilots. I enquired of the monks and Arabs about tho&s;e places, as well as about the ruins, &s;uppo&s;ed by the bi&s;hop of O&s;&s;ory, to be Kade&s;h-Barnea: the former could only tell me, "they had not received any fi&s;h from thence in many years; that it was two ea&s;y days journey off, but the road was mountainous;" &s;o one may &s;uppo&s;e the di&s;tance le&s;s than forty miles. The Arabs agreed as to the road; but they &s;aid, "it was once a large place where their prince lived, who&s;e daughter Mo&s;es married; that Mo&s;es was afterwards their prince, and the greate&s;t of all prophets." The&s;e Arabs place Mo&s;es the fir&s;t, Solomon the &s;econd, Maho|met the third, Chri&s;t the fourth, and then the pro|phets of the Bible. As to Dzahab, the monks only knew the di&s;tance to be four days journey, and that there was a road from it to Jeru&s;alem: the Arabs told me the &s;ame; &s;o the di&s;tance is about eighty miles. I enquired of them all about the ruins; they told me "there were con&s;iderable ones about half way to Dzahab, about forty miles from Sinai;" but I &s;hould think Kade&s;h mu&s;t have been much nearer to Jeru&s;alem. I would have willing|ly gone to the&s;e places; but as the four clans of Arabs, who inhabit this promontory, were then at war with one another, I could get no conductor. In another journey I hope to be more lucky, for this is all hear&s;ay; however, combining the whole together, and comparing it with what we collect from &s;cripture, I think we may well conclude, Sharme to be Midian, and Dzahab to be Ezion|gaber: what the interjacent ruins are I cannot con|jecture; but I believe I have found Kade&s;h-Bar|nea to be el&s;ewhere. I think it cannot be here, for the I&s;raelites were on the borders of the Holy
<PB N="488" REF="4900">
Land, when they were ordered back; and when they were &s;topped by the Moabites, they are &s;aid to have been brought up from Kade&s;h-Barnea; and I meet with no place in &s;acred writing, or any an|tient geographer, neither Strabo nor any other, that draw the line of divi&s;ion, between this pro|montory and the Land of Promi&s;e, &s;o low down; nor could they do it, as the&s;e ruins are within al|mo&s;t &s;eventy miles of the extremity of it. There are two roads from Mount Sinai to Jeru&s;alem; the one through Pharan, the other by the way of Dza|hab. That through Pharan is eleven days jour|ney; two to Pharan, three to a &s;tation of the Mec|ca pilgrims, called Scheich Ali, one and an half to &s;ome con&s;iderable ruins; all this to the north|ward: from thence four and &s;omething more to Jeru&s;alem, by way of Hebron, leaving the A&s;phal|tic Lake on the right hand, to the &s;outh-ea&s;t ward. The other road is longer, on account of its being more mountainous; that too pa&s;&s;es by the &s;ame ruins, and al&s;o Scheich Ali. I enquired about this when I was at Jeru&s;alem, and received the very &s;ame account, with this addition, that &s;uch Mohammedans as went from Jeru&s;alem to Mecca went that way, to join the Cairo caravan at Scheich Ali. This &s;eems to be a &s;ituation oppo|&s;ite to Kade&s;h Barnea, at the line drawn by all the geographers: it is without Mount Sinai, taken for this whole tract; and ju&s;t before the Moabites, as the Children of I&s;rael pa&s;&s;ed by Mount Hor, now Acaba, leaving the A&s;phaltic Lake on the left hand, to the north-we&s;t. The tradition too of the Arabs is, that they pa&s;&s;ed this way; therefore, I think, Kade&s;h Barnea mu&s;t be near this &s;pot. There are here con&s;iderable ruins: and I know of no city that ever was here; for Petra lay more to the ea&s;t, between the Elanitic and the A&s;phaltic Lake. To leave no enquiry wanting, I a&s;ked the Rabbins
<PB N="489" REF="4910">
of Jeru&s;alem, "Where they placed Kade&s;h Bar|nea?" and they &s;aid, "At the&s;e ruins."</P>
<P>We &s;et out from Mount Sinai, by the way of Scheich Salem; and, after we had pa&s;&s;ed Mo|hammed's Stone, came to a beautiful valley, where I lay that night, and hope I have di&s;covered the manna; and did not &s;et out before day-light, that I might not pa&s;s the rock which Mo&s;es &s;truck twice. I &s;earched, and enquired of my Arabs, but could neither hear nor &s;ee any thing of it. I &s;aw &s;everal &s;hort in&s;criptions &s;tained on &s;ome parts of the mountains; the characters being the &s;ame with tho&s;e on Mount Sinai, Meribah, &amp;c. given by the bi&s;hop of O&s;&s;ory. About four hours before we ar|rived at Sharan, we pa&s;&s;ed through a remarkable breach in a rock: each &s;ide of it is as perpendicular as a wall, about eighty feet high; and the breach is about forty broad. It is at this breach, I ima|gine, the Horites were &s;mote, four miles beyond the pre&s;ent ruins of Pharan; for having pa&s;&s;ed this breach they could make a &s;tand, nor could they well be pur&s;ued. Here, on the tops of the mountains to our right hand, were the ruins of buildings; and one &s;eemed a ca&s;tle. From Meri|bah to this place we had always rather de&s;cended: in mo&s;t places there is the bed of a &s;tream, and af|ter rain the water runs; but, a little before we came to this breach, it winded off towards the we&s;t; for the waters fall into that part of the de|&s;ert we cro&s;&s;ed from Tor. Between this breach and Pharan there are &s;everal &s;prings, and one at Pharan, where we encamped: there is the bed of the river mentioned in the journal, the traditional account of which agrees with what is &s;aid by St. Paul. Waters &s;eem to have run from Meribah to within about &s;ix miles of this place: the bed of a &s;tream is hear again very plain, and a &s;pring at the upper end of it, which does not yield water enough
<PB N="490" REF="4920">
to make a &s;tream; the bed then is dry: four val|lies terminate here, and form a large area. I en|quired about the road to Jeru&s;alem; the people agreed in the di&s;tance and ruins. We travelled in the bed of the river, through the valley, to the north; and, in about half an hour, the &s;ight and appearance of a large &s;tone, not unlike Meribah, which lay at &s;ome di&s;tance from the mountain on our right hand, &s;truck me; and I al&s;o ob&s;erved, it had many &s;mall &s;tones upon it. The Arabs, when they have any &s;tone or &s;pot in veneration, as Mo|hammed's Stone and the like, after their devotion, lay &s;ome &s;mooth &s;tones upon it. I a&s;ked, "What it was?" and they told me, "Hagar Mou&s;a," the Stone of Mo&s;es. I told them, "That could not be; for that lay in Rephidim" They &s;aid, "That was true; but this was Hagar il Chotatain, (the Stone of the two Strokes); that he &s;truck it twice, and more water came from it than from Meribah, witne&s;s the river." The bed of the river winds to the ea&s;tward, about ea&s;t-&s;outh-ea&s;t. I a&s;ked, "How far it went?" They &s;aid, "This bed ran by Sheich Ali to tho&s;e rivers, and quite away to the &s;ea:" &s;o that river mu&s;t have begun here, and not at Pharan; and the bed from Pharan hi|ther is only formed, I &s;uppo&s;e, by winter torrents. If this is the bed of the river mentioned by St. Paul, as I dare &s;ay it is, we have the &s;econd rock: if it runs to the ruins, as is &s;aid, and there is no rea&s;on to doubt it, they will be pretty plainly tho&s;e of Kade&s;h Barnea; and if the bed continues in the &s;ame cour&s;e to the &s;ea, as it probably does, this mu&s;t be the river at Rinocolura, &s;uppo&s;ed by Era|to&s;thenes to be formed by the Arabian Lakes, be|cau&s;e he did not know its miraculous head. This river is doubted of by Strabo, becau&s;e dried up to the &s;ource, from the time the I&s;raelites entered the Land of Promi&s;e, and the tradition was then lo&s;t.
<PB N="491" REF="4930">
Pardon this bold conjecture; but it coincides, and conciliates &s;acred hi&s;tory with geography: this too &s;eems a proof, that this is really the &s;econd-&s;truck rock. As to the &s;prings between the breach and Pharan, they certainly did not exi&s;t in the time of Mo&s;es; or, if they did, they would have been as nothing to &s;o many people.</P>
<P>We went down a large valley to the we&s;t, to|wards the &s;ea; and pa&s;&s;ed the head of a valley, a part of the de&s;ert of Sin, which &s;eparates the mountains of Pharan from tho&s;e which run along the coa&s;t, and the &s;ame plain which we had pa&s;&s;ed from Tor. We had &s;carce entered the&s;e mountains, and tra|velled an hour, when, after pa&s;&s;ing a mountain where there was vi&s;ible marks of an extingui&s;hed &s;ubterraneous fire, we &s;aw, on our left hand, a &s;mall rock, with &s;ome unknown characters cut on it, not &s;tained upon, as tho&s;e hitherto met with; and, in ten minutes, we entered a valley &s;ix miles broad, running nearly north with all the rocks, which en|clo&s;e it on the we&s;t &s;ide, covered with characters. The&s;e are what are called Gebel El Macaatab, the Written Mountains. On examining the&s;e charac|ters, I was greatly di&s;appointed in finding them every where inter&s;per&s;ed with figures of men and bea&s;ts; which convinced me they were not written by the I&s;raelites: for if they had been, after the publication of the law, Mo&s;es would not have per|mitted them to have engraven images, &s;o immedi|ately after he had received the &s;econd command|ment: if they went this way, and not along the coa&s;t, they had then no characters, that we know of, unle&s;s &s;ome of them were &s;killed in hierogly|phics, and the&s;e have no connection with them. It will be difficult to gue&s;s what the&s;e in&s;criptions are; and I fear, if ever it is di&s;covered, they will be &s;carce worth the pains. If conjecture be per|mitted, I will give my very weak thoughts: they cannot be written by I&s;raelites, or Mohammedans,
<PB N="492" REF="4940">
for the above rea&s;on; and if by Mohammedans, they would have &s;ome re&s;emblance to &s;ome &s;ort of Cuphic characters, which were the characters u&s;ed in the Arabic language, before the introduction of the pre&s;ent Arabic letters. The fir&s;t manu&s;cripts of the Alcoran were in Cuphic: there is a very fine one at Cairo, which I could not purcha&s;e; for it is in the principal mo&s;que, and the iman would not &s;teal it for me under four hundred &s;equins, two hundred pounds. The&s;e have not the lea&s;t re|&s;emblance to them. Saracen characters are very unlike; be&s;ides, I &s;hould place them higher than the Hegira. I think it then not improbable, that they were written in the fir&s;t ages of Chri&s;tianity, and perhaps the very fir&s;t; when, I &s;uppo&s;e, pil|grimages from Jeru&s;alem to Mount Sinai were fa&s;hionable, con&s;equently frequent and numerous, by the new Chri&s;trian Jews, who believed in Chri&s;t; therefore, I &s;hould believe them Hebrew charac|ters, u&s;ed vulgarly by the Jews about the time of Chri&s;t. I &s;hewed them, when at Jeru&s;alem, to the Rabbins; and they were of the &s;ame opinion. But the&s;e are all conjectures; and it &s;eems much ea&s;ier to &s;ay what the&s;e in&s;criptions are not, than what they are. On other parts of this rock are &s;ome Greek and Arabic, as well as &s;ome Saracen in&s;criptions, and al&s;o an Hebrew one. The Sara|cen and Arabic only &s;ay, "Such a one was here at &s;uch a time;" the &s;ame &s;ay the Greek ones, except one, which &s;ays, "The evil genius of the army wrote this;" which only prove, that &s;ome body of Greeks were wor&s;ted here, after the characters were written; and that they attributed their de|feat to &s;ome magic power in the&s;e characters, which &s;eem to be of the very &s;ame kind with tho&s;e &s;tained on different parts of Mount Sinai, Meribah, &amp;c. which the learned bi&s;hop of O&s;&s;ory has given.</P>
<P><PB N="493" REF="4950">
The third day from this place, travelling we&s;t|ward, we encamped at Korondel, where are the bitter waters of Marah. I tried if the branches of any of the trees had any effect on the waters, but found none; &s;o that the effect mentioned in Scripture mu&s;t have been miraculous. The&s;e wa|ters, at the &s;pring, are &s;omewhat bitter and brack|i&s;h; but, as every foot they run over the &s;and is covered with bituminous &s;alts, grown up by the exce&s;&s;ive heat of the &s;un, they acquire much &s;alt|ne&s;s and bitterne&s;s, and very &s;oon become not pot|able. This place, off which the &s;hips ca&s;t anchor, lies below a &s;and or flat i&s;land, at low water, and near a whirlpool, called Birque Korondel. After nine hours and a half march, we arrived and encamped at the de&s;ert of Shur or Saur. The con&s;tant tra|dition is, that the I&s;raelites a&s;cended from the &s;ea at this place; being oppo&s;ite to a plain on the Egyptian &s;ide of the gulph, called Badeath, to which an opening in the mountains leads. This opening appears from hence as a great crack, and may be called a mouth, taking Hiroth for an ap|pellative; however, I &s;hould rather adopt the &s;ig|nification of Liberty. It would hardly have been nece&s;&s;ary for the I&s;raelites to pa&s;s the &s;ea, if they were within two or three miles of the northern ex|tremity of the gulph; the &s;pace at mo&s;t two miles, the breadth of the gulph at Suez, and at mo&s;t three feet deep at low water, for it is then con&s;tantly waded over, could not have contained &s;o many people, or drowned Pharaoh's army: there would have been little nece&s;&s;ity for his cavalry and cha|riots to precipitate them&s;elves after a number of people on foot, encumbered with their wives, chil|dren, and baggage, when they could &s;oon have overtaken them, by going a little about. The&s;e rea&s;ons, added to the &s;ignificant names of the places, Tauriche Beni I&s;rael, Road of the Children
<PB N="494" REF="4960">
of I&s;rael; Attacah, Deliverance; Pihahiroth, whe|ther an appellative or &s;ignificative; Badeah, New Thing, or Miracle; Bachorel Pol&s;um, Sea of De|&s;truction, convince me, that the I&s;raelites entered the &s;ea at Badeah, and no where el&s;e. The current &s;ets from this place towards the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, into the Birque Pharaone, or Pool of Pharaoh, where the tradition is, that his ho&s;t was drowned; a current formed, I &s;uppo&s;e, by the falling and ru&s;hing of one watery wall upon the other, and driving it down; a current, perhaps, by God permitted to remain ever &s;ince, in <HI>memoriam rei.</HI> The di&s;tance to the bitter waters is about thirty miles: I omit|ted to mention in this place, that, between this and Korondel, we were not &s;o lucky as the bi&s;hop of O&s;&s;ory, who met with a charming rivulet of &s;weet water; we met with none, good or bad. The Aia Mou&s;a, which the I&s;raelites would have met with if they had pa&s;&s;ed at Suez, and the coa&s;t from hence &s;outhward, about a mile to Tor, being all rock, and &s;teep too, further confirms me in the opinion, that the I&s;raelites entered the &s;ea at Badeah, and a&s;cended from it here, and not at any other place.</P>
<P>If any thing I have &s;aid can, in the lea&s;t, &s;up|port that revelation to which I dare declare my&s;elf a friend, even in this enlightened age, I &s;hall be very happy, and think my pains well be&s;towed."</P>
