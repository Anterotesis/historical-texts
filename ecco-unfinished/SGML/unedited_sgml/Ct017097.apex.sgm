<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THIS little volume contains the wittici&s;ms of a very di&s;tingui&s;hed character, who has ju&s;t withdrawn from the great theatre of the world; who, living, &s;allied boldly on that mon&s;ter, VICE, and de|feated him with a continual di&s;charge of je&s;ts and laugh|ter; and who, dead, is regretted by all who have been charmed with the poignancy and brilliancy of his &s;atire. It was FOOTE, the child of nature, who &s;trewed the path to di&s;cretion with the flowers of wit and humour. It was this author, manager, and per|former, by whom we were in&s;tructed, that elaborate di&s;&s;ertations on virtue and vice have not the effectof a well-dige&s;ted dramatic exhibition; for though we are equally attracted by the <HI>beautiful</HI> and <HI>deformed,</HI> admiring the one, and abhorring the other, yet we forbear an inve&s;tigation of the beauty of virtue and deformity of vice. The rea&s;on is obvious: Virtue we find commonly delineated with &s;o grave an a&s;pect, that tho&s;e who would be willingly her votaries, find|ing &s;o re&s;erved a mi&s;tre&s;s, behold her at a di&s;tance, as they do vice, of who&s;e deformity they unhappily have not a &s;ufficient &s;en&s;e. Hence the celebrated dramati&s;t, who&s;e memory we mean to commemorate, painted to the imagination, in a continued &s;cene of mirth and humour, the hideou&s;ne&s;s of the one, and the attractive graces of the other. But, alas! the golden branch is cropt, without leaving, we fear, a &s;ucceeding &s;hoot to di&s;play equal rays of &s;uch pure and tran&s;cendent lu&s;tre.&mdash;Death has &s;natched him from us, and we bemoan the lo&s;s of a man, whom candour will acknowledge to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed one of the be&s;t heads, and not one of the wor&s;t hearts; and that perhaps "we never &s;hall look upon his like again."</P>

<HEAD><HI>WIT for the TON!</HI> OR, SAM FOOTE's LAST BUDGET OPENED.</HEAD>
<P>_ON the Saturday before the decea&s;e of Mr. Foote (which happened, at Dover, on the evening of Tue&s;day the 21&s;t of October, 1777) he had a &s;elect party of friends to dine with him at his hou&s;e at North-End; and was ob|&s;erved to be not only remarkably chearful, and full of his wonted plea&s;antry, and convivial flow of &s;oul, but to be in as good a &s;tate of health as at any time &s;ince his fir&s;t illne&s;s, in the preceding April.</P>
<P>This illu&s;trious ornament of the drama, and unrivalled hero in the fields of genuine wit, humour, and &s;atire, was in the fifty-&s;ixth year of his age when he made his &s;udden
<PB N="6" REF="7">
<HI>exit</HI> from the <HI>theatre</HI> of this world, in con&s;equence of a &s;troke of the pal&s;y.</P>
<P>He was de&s;cended from a very re&s;pectable Corni&s;h family, was born at Truro in Cornwall, and educated at a &s;chool in that place, from whence he was, at a proper &s;ea&s;on, re|moved to Worce&s;ter college, in the univer&s;ity of Oxford; a college founded by one of his near relations.</P>
<P>Early in life Mr. Foote came into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an ample fortune; but the extraordinary liveline&s;s of his di&s;po|&s;ition, added to an uncommon quickne&s;s of parts, render|ing him a very de&s;irable companion, he &s;oon formed a large circle of acquaintance, and, joining with them in all the di&s;&s;ipations of the times, found him&s;elf in di&s;tre&s;s in a very few years. In a whim&s;ical moment he thought of the &s;tage, as a field for fame and fortune, and played Othello at the little theatre in the Hay-market, as a trial part. He after|wards appeared in Fondlewife, Lord Foppington, Sir Paul Plyant, and many other characters, with &s;ucce&s;s. About the year 1746, he open$d the Hay-Market theatre with his <HI>Diver&s;ions of the Morning,</HI> but was &s;topped on the &s;econd day's performance through the intere&s;t, and at the reque&s;t, of the late Mr. Lacy, at that time patentee of Drury-Lane theatre. He afterwards procured the protection of a noble duke, and through his means continued for &s;ome time to profit, by pre&s;enting the publick with various eccentric ef|forts of h s mu&s;e. He afterwards had more than one en|gagement at Drury-Lane theatre, during Mr. Garrick's management; and for &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;ummers, within the la&s;t twenty years, he played at the Hay-market hou&s;e, under favour of a licence from the Lord Chamberlain for the time being. A well known accident <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That of the lo&s;s of a leg, in con&s;equence of a fall from his hor&s;e, while in company with his late royal highne&s;s the duke of York; through who&s;e generous interference our Ari&s;tophanes procured this grant from his maje&s;ty, and was thereby (to u&s;e a pun) <HI>re-e&s;tabli&s;hed upon his legs more firmly than ever.</HI></NOTE>(which happened to him in the $ear 1766) was the means of his obtaining a patent, authorizing him, during the term of his natural life, to open the Haymarket theatre on the 15th day of May, and continue it open till the 15th of September every year.</P>
<P>His various pieces are familiar to the publick. Few au|thors can boa&s;t of having written &s;o many; perhaps no one
<PB N="7" REF="8">
of having &s;o rarely experienced the cen&s;ure of the theatre His <HI>&s;ort</HI> was the exhibition of character, in which, although he was rather a painter for effect, than the holder of a deli|cate pencil, yet, for boldne&s;s of outline, and &s;trength and truth of colouring, he &s;tood unrivalled. His dialogue in general is ter&s;e, ea&s;y, and witty. His &s;cenes teem with true humour; and, under the ma&s;k of infinite plea&s;antry, convey the &s;tronge&s;t &s;atire. No dramatic writer ever paid le&s;s attention to the fables of his plays; and yet there are not to be &s;een, in the whole round of modern pieces, &s;o many &s;triking pictures of vice and folly as have been drawn by the late Mr. Foote. He may be truly &s;aid to have "caught the living manners as they ro&s;e," and to have had the happy art of pre&s;enting, whatever he de&s;igned to exhi|bit, in a point of view &s;o truly ridiculous, that every au|ditor was under the nece&s;&s;ity of joining in the general laughter excited, and left the theatre not the le&s;s amended for having been uncommonly well entertained. To &s;um up all, as an author, Mr. Foote was fertile, comic, and ner|vous; as an actor, bold, original, and warm: his talents, it is true, lay rather in the exhibition of <HI>caricature</HI> than <HI>character;</HI> in a peculiar line, however, and that of a capital &s;ort, he was not only ma&s;terly, but &s;uperior to every com|petitor. As a private man, he was humane, generous, and friendly; &s;oftened by the tale of di&s;tre&s;s, liberal in the re|lief of indigence, or the reward of merit, and ready on all occa&s;ions to a&s;&s;i&s;t either with his pen, his pur&s;e, or his per|&s;onal intere&s;t, all who had the &s;malle&s;t claim to his friend|&s;hip. In the company of men of high rank, and &s;uperior fortune, (who eagerly &s;ought his acquaintance) he pre|&s;erved an ea&s;y and noble independency; as a man of wit and conviviality, there lives not his equal. Nor was he le&s;s ho&s;pitable than &s;ocial; his many, many friends who now live &s;incerely to lament his lo&s;s can atte&s;t this a&s;&s;ertion. Since no man therefore has more e&s;&s;entially contributed to the entertainment of the public, or more repeatedly made the minds of his acquaintance expand with mirth and good humour, let us in gratitude pa&s;s over his few foibles, and reflect on his many virtues, with that mixture of joy and &s;orrow felt by every individual, who in the moment he re|grets the lo&s;s of a dear friend, rejoices that among the ac|tions of his life many de&s;erve the highe&s;t prai&s;e, and that the effu&s;ions of his genius have e&s;tabli&s;hed him a degree of
<PB N="8" REF="9">
fame &s;uperior to the bla&s;ts of envy, the efforts of malice, and the corroding tooth of time it&s;elf.</P>
<P>To the above account it may not be improper to add, that Mr. Foote had taken care to make his will &s;everal years before his death. By it his <HI>natural,</HI> and only &s;ur|viving child, Ma&s;ter George Foote (who is now about &s;even years of age, and at boarding-&s;chool at Ayle&s;bury in Buckingham&s;hire) was con&s;tituted re&s;iduary legatee; and the late Mr. Fitzherbert, Mr. Hamilton of Falcon-Court, Fleet-&s;treet, and Mr. Jewel (for many years Mr. Foote's trea&s;urer and &s;teward) were nominated executors.</P>
<P>Mr. Foote was hardly more remarkable for the brilliancy of his <HI>wit,</HI> and the &s;ingularity of his <HI>humour,</HI> than for his <HI>penchant</HI> to the <HI>delicacies of the table</HI>&mdash;Happening, not long before his death, to call upon a friend in the city, in order to eat a bit of dinner with him, he was <HI>&s;o far in luck</HI> as to enter in the very nick when Mr. and Mrs.&mdash;were &s;eating them&s;elves at table.&mdash;As the Daemon of di&s;appoint|ment would have it, however, he was <HI>&s;o far out of luck,</HI> that, on the morning of the day he called, the kitchen|chimney had fallen down while dinner was getting ready; nor had the cook (highly as &s;he was a&s;toni&s;hed, and in a manner <HI>planet&punc;&s;truck)</HI> been able to &s;ave, from the general wreck, more than a <HI>tureen of &s;oup</HI> and <HI>a neck of mutton.</HI>&mdash;Accu&s;tomed to &s;ee a variety of good things at his friend's table, Mr. Foote, on being a&s;ked to have &s;ome &s;oup, re|plied, <HI>No&mdash;I'll wait for &s;omething el&s;e.</HI>&mdash;To the &s;oup &s;uc|ceeded the mutton; and the hungry Ari&s;tophanes being, in like manner as before, de&s;ired to have &s;ome&mdash;<HI>No, thank ye</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>I'll wait for &s;omething el&s;e.</HI>&mdash;The deception could be now kept up no longer; and accordingly the lady of the hou&s;e, with a thou&s;and apologies for it, told him of the accident, and recapitulated to him all its particulars. "Hay!" cried the Wag, with infinite good-humour, in|terrupting the lady, and giving a broad look to the &s;ervant, who was by this time (not knowing of what had pa&s;&s;ed) preparing to di&s;mantle the board&mdash;"hay! Madam," cried he&mdash;"what, are we, then, come to &s;hort allowance? Then here, John! not &s;o fa&s;t, bring back the mutton; for egad! I find it's now NECK or NOTHING with us."</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="10">
"Our poor departed Sammy" (as his &s;urviving convi|vial friends now &s;tyle him in their joyous hours) was never remarkable for <HI>oeconomy;</HI> and &s;o long as <HI>aeconomy</HI> continued the favourite <HI>pa&s;s-word</HI> at court, &s;o long did it continue the favourite <HI>mock-word</HI> of the <HI>Engli&s;h Ari&s;tophanes.</HI>&mdash;Every|body who remembers Mr. Foote, mu&s;t remember the beau|tiful &s;et of <HI>dun</HI> hor&s;es with which he u&s;ed formerly to drive his carriage.&mdash;On being complimented re&s;pecting their limbs, their fine &s;hapes and colour, one day&mdash;"Yes (re|turned the Wag) I am never without a <HI>&s;et of duns</HI> in my retinue; but with this difference, that in the &s;ummer I drive the <HI>duns,</HI> and in the winter the <HI>duns</HI> drive me."</P>
<P>Mr. Foote was particularly happy in <HI>taking off</HI> a certain &s;elf-important, though highly-illiterate, <HI>&s;peechifier</HI> belonging to that &s;eminary of dulne&s;s&mdash;the Robinhood &s;ociety!&mdash;This <HI>learned</HI> orator was remarkable for making a frequent and ri|diculous u&s;e of the words, <HI>What not?</HI>&mdash;Speaking of the extravagancy of young trade&s;men, he once &s;aid, "Things are got to &s;uch a pa&s;s now a days, that every petty trade&s;|man mu&s;t be continually running to Vaux-Hall, Ranelagh, or the Play-hou&s;es, and <HI>what not?</HI>&mdash;By which means they become acquainted with the infamous women of the town, and contract bad di&s;ea&s;es, and <HI>what not?</HI> By the&s;e means they de&s;troy their wealth and con&s;titution, and <HI>what not?</HI> And pre&s;ently after they get them&s;elves into a gaol, or the Gazette, and <HI>what not?</HI> and perhaps they have a young family at home, expo&s;ed to want and beggary, and <HI>what not?"</HI> A Wag pre&s;ent could not help &s;hewing his appro|bation of this elegant harangue, in the following words: "Sir, you are a man of great erudition, ingenuity, genius, and <HI>what not?"</HI></P>
<P>A certain city patriot is as fond, to this hour, of the phra&s;e, <HI>things of that kind,</HI> as the orator was of <HI>what not?</HI> The words <HI>things of that kind,</HI> are terms that he frequently applies to the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite articles. The following is a &s;pecimen: "I am very fond," &s;aid he, "of <HI>leg of veal</HI> or <HI>ox-cheek,</HI> and <HI>things of that kind,</HI> but I abominably hate <HI>roa&s;t leef,</HI> or <HI>loiled &s;owl,</HI> or <HI>tripe,</HI> and <HI>things of that kind:"</HI> "I don't like to &s;ee your <HI>oratorios,</HI> and puppet-&s;hews, and <HI>things of that kind,"</HI> but I am very fond of <HI>comedies</HI> and <HI>tra|gedies,</HI> and <HI>things of that kind."</HI> An acquaintance once pro|po&s;ed to walk with him to Richmond. "No" (replied he) it is too far to walk; let us take a <HI>boat</HI> or a <HI>coach,</HI> or
<PB N="10" REF="11">
<HI>&s;omething of that kind."</HI> He once declared that he was quite weary of a <HI>&s;ingle life,</HI> and was determined to get <HI>married,</HI> or <HI>&s;omething of that kind;"</HI> but if he &s;hould happen to expre&s;s him&s;elf in &s;o coar&s;e a manner, to the young lady he happens to addre&s;s, &s;he may probably give him a denial, or <HI>&s;omething of that kind.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Foote &s;tanding one day, in a very pen&s;ive attitude, in the kitchen-garden of Carlton-hou&s;e, and being ob|&s;erved by a gentleman from a window, the latter &s;aid to par&s;on Foote, "What the d&mdash;l is <HI>Sam</HI> doing yonder among the cabbages?"&mdash;"Let's go and &s;ee," replies the par&s;on. Accordingly the&s;e two gentlemen, with &s;ome la|dies, repaired to the &s;pot where the Wit &s;tood. "What are you doing there, Mr. Foote?" &s;aid one of the ladies. "Why, Madam, replied he, I'm in raptures!"&mdash;"In raptures!" &s;aid the lady, "with what?"&mdash;"With a <HI>cab|bage-&s;talk,"</HI> added the Wit, and in&s;tantly began the follow|ing di&s;&s;ertation on it, which he afterwards reduced to wri|ting, nearly verbatim as &s;poken, and of which many copies were t ken:</P>
<P>"A <HI>cabbage-&s;talk,</HI> ladies and gentlemen; what &s;hall I &s;ay of a <HI>cabbage-&s;talk?</HI> The fir&s;t part of it to be con&s;idered is t$e <HI>root;</HI> $or, without the <HI>root,</HI> nothing can be &s;aid on the matter. Well, then, the <HI>root!</HI>&mdash;ob&s;erve the <HI>root,</HI> ladies: See the numerous filaments by which it receives its nurture. Were ye, ladies, but as deeply <HI>rooted</HI> in <HI>love,</HI> your fruits might be as an&s;werable. But, to &s;peak in general terms: We$e <HI>we</HI> but as deeply <HI>rooted</HI> in mutual friend&s;hip, <HI>our</HI> fruits would be as e&s;timable. But, on the contrary, we had rather vegetate in a vicious &s;oil, and on avarice, which is the <HI>root</HI> of all evil, and graft the whole fraternity of vices.</P>
<P>"There is another rea$on, ladies and gentlemen, why I begin with the <HI>root</HI> of this cabbage; becau&s;e it repre&s;ents the <HI>exordium</HI> of a di&s;cour&s;e; the <HI>&s;talk</HI> is the ratiocination, or argum$ntative part, and the <HI>head</HI> is the conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>"The <HI>root</HI> of this cabbage I &s;hall compare to the king,&mdash;becau&s;e, you &s;ee, as all power and honour are derived ultimately from his maj$&s;ty, &s;o the <HI>&s;talk</HI> and the <HI>head</HI> of this &s;ame cabbage derive as ultimately their exi&s;tence from the <HI>root:</HI> And, d'ye &s;$e, as this <HI>&s;talk</HI> and this <HI>head</HI> are recipro|cally an honour to the <HI>root,</HI>&mdash;&s;o his maje&s;ty is indebted to his &s;ubjects for his wealth, his power, and his magni|ficence.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="12">
"The <HI>root,</HI> I &s;ay, is the <HI>king;</HI>&mdash;and the <HI>&s;talk,</HI> then, &s;hall be the nobility and <HI>gentry:</HI>&mdash;And, let me $ee, what &s;hall be the <HI>head</HI> of the cabbage?&mdash;why, the common people;&mdash;aye, the common people are the head of the nation.</P>
<P>"He?&mdash;What?&mdash;Aye!&mdash;I'm right in my logic, &s;urely.&mdash;This <HI>cabbage-&s;talk</HI> is hollow: And how many human cabbage-&s;talks are there in this va&s;t garden the world! He?&mdash;how many hypocrites?&mdash;This &s;talk was once of a lovely green, and full of &s;ap, but now dried and withered:&mdash;And what is the fate of man but that of a cabbage-&s;talk?&mdash;Nay, my little preaching puppy of a bro|ther, here, who &s;tands by me, mu&s;t if he wi&s;hes to di&s;play his oratorical powers, actually imagine that his hearers are all <HI>cabbage-&s;talks.</HI> It will be then that &s;oft per&s;ua&s;ion, like Hyblean honey, will flow from his lips; then, that the blaze of eloquence warm his audience;&mdash;then&mdash;but by Jupiter 'tis dinner-time&mdash;my reflections are over&mdash;&s;o there is an end of my di&s;&s;ertation on a cabbage-&s;talk."</P>
<P>Some years &s;ince, Mr. Foote dined at the Ca&s;tle at Salt-Hill. When Partridge produced the bill, Foote thought it very exorbitant, and a&s;ked him his name&mdash;"Partridge, and plea&s;e you," replied the Ho&s;t.&mdash;"Patridge!" re&s;umed Foote, "it &s;hould be <HI>Woodcock,</HI> by the length of your <HI>bill."</HI></P>
<P>On being a&s;ked, what he thought of the late Sir Ba&s;il Keith's appointment to the government of Jamaica, "What do I think? replied the Wit&mdash;I think that the Iri&s;h <HI>take us all in,</HI> and the Scots <HI>turn us all out."</HI></P>
<P>A phy&s;ician at Bath once told Mr. Foote, that he had a mind to publi&s;h his poems; but, &s;aid he, I have &s;o many irons in the fire, I do not know what to do. "Then take my advice," &s;aid the other, "and put your poems into the fire <HI>with the re&s;t of your irons."</HI></P>
<P>Sitting in a coffee-room, one day, and a dog being very trouble&s;ome, Ari&s;tophanes bid the waiter kick him out; but in the hurry of bu&s;ine&s;s he forgot it. The dog continuing to pe&s;ter him, he &s;aid if the waiter did not kick the dog out, he would kick him out. "Sir;" &s;aid a young coxcomb, "I perceive you are not fond of dogs."&mdash;"No" &s;aid he, "nor puppies neither."</P>
<P>As Tom F&mdash;(the celebrated <HI>Cornuto)</HI> was boa&s;ting, in company, what a numher of children his wife had brought
<PB N="12" REF="13">
him: "Aye (&s;aid Foote, with a &s;ly wink) there would be &s;ome rea&s;on for all this triumph, could you but tell who was the <HI>father</HI> of them."</P>
<P><HI>Anecdote of General Pa$li.</HI>&mdash;As the Cor&s;ican chief was one evening walking down the Haymarket, he was acco&s;ted by an itinerant daughter of unlicen&s;ed plea&s;ure, who hap|pened to know his face. As &s;he was a very pretty girl, he &s;uffered her to hold his arm till he got to Spring Gardens, when he thought to di&s;engage him&s;elf from her lady&s;hip; but &s;he &s;till held him, and finding all her former rhetoric lo&s;t, told him, if he would leave her, he ought to make her a hand&s;ome pre&s;ent at lea&s;t, as they were very nearly con|nected. The Veteran &s;tared, and demanded how. Why, Sir, &s;aid the girl, you have been driven from home, and lo&s;t your inheritance in defence of liberty; by being attached too much to the &s;ame cau&s;e, I am reduced to the like extre|mity. We are both the children of liberty, and therefore ought to have a fellow-feeling for each other. The wit of the girl &s;o much plea&s;ed the old &s;on of Mars, that he took out his pur&s;e, and gave her a guinea.</P>
<P>In the early part of his life, the late Sir Alexander Grant practi&s;ed phy&s;ic in the We&s;t Indies.&mdash;As he was rather proud, Mr. Foote, in order to mortify him, acco&s;ted him one day by the title of Dr. Grant, after he had a&s;&s;umed that of Baronet. When Sir Alexander found there was no end of <HI>How do you do, Dr. Grant?</HI> he replied warmly, "Sir, I am no doctor"&mdash;"No faith (&s;aid the other) nor ever were."</P>
<P>The duke of C. dining at Foote's, when Mr. Reynolds was pre&s;ent; his highne&s;s &s;aid, "So, Mr. Reynolds, I find you are intimate with Mr. Wilkes.&mdash;Pray what time does he go to bed?&mdash;what time does he ri&s;e?" And &s;everal que&s;|tions equally important.&mdash;"Your highne&s;s (cried Foote) will plea&s;e to remember that Mr. Reynolds is Wilkes's <HI>attorney,</HI> not his <HI>chamberlain."</HI></P>
<P>When Mr. Foote was told, about a week before his death, of the &s;ingular circum&s;tance of a banker's wife, in Birmingham, <HI>making it a point</HI> to be always in the &s;traw at the time of her maje&s;ty's lying-in, he bur&s;t into an immo|derate fit of laughter, and (&s;haking his &s;ides all the while) &s;aid it put him in mind of a courtier who (as the &s;tory went when he was a boy) had been &s;o u&s;ed to pay homage to
<PB N="13" REF="14">
maje&s;ty, that when queen Anne, one day at the levee, a&s;ked him, when he expected his lady would be brought to bed, in&s;tantly replied, with a profound bow&mdash;<HI>Whenever your maje&s;ty &s;hall think proper.</HI></P>
<P>An Italian gentleman, who was dangerou&s;ly ill, and at the &s;ame time heavily charged with debts, told his confe&s;&s;or that the only favour he had to a&s;k of Heaven, was, that his life might be prolonged till he di&s;charged them.

To the honour of our departed Ari&s;tophanes it is to be remarked, that he was not more eminent for being a man of wit him&s;elf, than for being a patron of wit in others.&mdash;Happening to be in the city, &s;ome years ago, while a num|ber of convicts were marching along hand-cu&s;&s;ed, in order to be conveyed on board a ve&s;&s;el in the river, de&s;tined to carry them, pa&s;&s;age free, over the <HI>herring-pond,</HI> curio&s;ity induced him to &s;top, and take a view of them.&mdash;Nothing could exceed the apparent gaiety of the culprits; of whom &s;ome were whi&s;tling, &s;ome &s;inging, and all beating time to the rude notes of a tabor and pipe, which they had hired to celebrate the <HI>happy event</HI> of their departure to the <HI>New World.</HI>&mdash;In a fit of amazement, "Ble&s;s me!" cried Foote aloud, to a friend who accompanied him, "how merry the&s;e poor fellows are!"

<P><HI>An Anecdote.</HI>&mdash;In the early part of the late Mr. Foote's life he &s;truggled with great di&s;tre&s;s in con&s;equence of a thoughtle&s;s, expen&s;ive turn of mind: He has been often without a &s;hilling, or the means of procuring one, and would &s;ometimes wear boots to conceal his deficiency of &s;tockings: nay, he has owned to &s;ome intimate friends, that but for the humanity of a woman who kept a chop|hou&s;e, and who gave him credit, he would, at one period of life, have wanted the nece&s;&s;aries of life. In the mid&s;t of this calamity, the relief of an unexpected &s;upply neither taught him fore&s;ight or frugality. Any bauble or object of plea&s;ure which &s;truck his fancy, he purcha&s;ed immediately without regarding the price; and pro&s;perity had &s;carce taken him to her arms before poverty would &s;natch him from her embrace. It is mortifying to human vanity to be|hold minds of the fine&s;t texture &s;ubject to the greate&s;t im|becilities; to find men of the be&s;t under&s;tandings guilty of actions for which a fool would blu&s;h, and dares to cen&s;ure them.

<P>A certain gambling man of quality, having thought pro|per to marry a notorious woman of the town, Mr. Foote was one day a&s;ked what he thought of the alliance "Think of it (replied Sam) why that nothing could be more &s;trictly in character; don't you know that <HI>brim&s;tone</HI> and <HI>cards</HI> make admirable matches?"</P>
<P>Some years ago, Mr. Foote and Dr. John&s;on, being in company together, the emigration of the Scotch to London became the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation: Foote in&s;i&s;ted that the emigrants were as numerous in the former, as in the pre&s;ent reign; the doctor the contrary: this di&s;pute continued with a friendly warmth for &s;ome time, when John&s;on called out, "You are certainly wrong, Sam; but I &s;ee you are de|ceived; you cannot di&s;tingui&s;h them now as formerly; for the fellows all come <HI>breeched</HI> to the capital of late years."</P>
<P>The above wits at another time having a conver&s;ation about national learning, Foote ob&s;erved, however deficient the Scotch were in genius and humour, he believed them to be one of the mo&s;t learned nations in Europe. "Oh! Sir, (&s;ays John&s;on) you are very much mi&s;taken upon that point: I grant you they have all a <HI>mouthful</HI> of learning, but not one of them a <HI>bellyful."</HI></P>
<P>A gentleman ju&s;t married, telling Foote he had that morn|ing laid out three thou&s;and pounds in jewels for his <HI>dear wife.</HI> "Faith, Sir," &s;ays the wit, "I &s;ee you are no hy|pocrite, for &s;he is truly your <HI>dear</HI> wife."</P>

When Mrs. Macauly publi&s;hed her <HI>Loo&s;e Thoughts,</HI> Foote, who was in company with Garrick, &s;aid it was a very im|proper title for a lady; to which the other replied, he was of a different opinion, for the &s;ooner a woman gets rid of <HI>&s;uch thoughts</HI> the better.</P>
<P>Foote meeting his old acquaintance Major B&mdash;, at Bath, this la&s;t &s;ea&s;on (a character well known in the annals of gaming), came up to him, and a&s;ked him with great cordiality, how he was? "Ah! Foote," &s;ays the other, "I have had a terrible accident &s;ince I &s;aw you la&s;t; no le&s;s than the <HI>lo&s;s</HI> of an eye." "My dear fellow," &s;ays the wit, "I am heartily &s;orry for it; pray at <HI>what game?"</HI></P>
<P>A per&s;on being taken in company with a woman by the con&s;table of the night, he began to expo&s;tulate with him; upon which the con&s;table an&s;wered, Sir, I am his Maje&s;|ty's Repre&s;entative, and I &s;hall <HI>not regard Remon&s;trances.</HI></P>
<P>Sir Francis Blake Delaval having married an extreme ugly lady, though very rich, Foot ob&s;erved, that Sir Francis had bought her by <HI>weight,</HI> and paid nothing for <HI>fa&s;hion.</HI></P>
<P>When Mr. Foote heard of the above gentleman's death, the &s;hock of lo&s;ing &s;o intimate a friend had &s;uch an effect on his &s;pirits, that he bur&s;t into tears, retired to his room, and &s;aw no company for two days: the third day, Jewel, his trea&s;urer, calling in upon him, he a&s;ked him, with &s;wolen eyes, what time would the burial be? "Not till next week, Sir," replied the other, "as I hear the &s;urgeons are fir&s;t to di&s;&s;ect his <HI>head."</HI> This la&s;t word recovered the wit's fancy, and repeating it with &s;ome &s;urprize, he a&s;ked, "And what the devil will they get there?

<P>The death of the late Mr. Holland, of Drury-Lane theatre (who was the &s;on of <HI>a baker</HI> at Chi&s;wick) had like|wi&s;e a very great effect on Foote's &s;pirits; being a legatee, as well as appointed, by the will of the decea&s;ed, one of his bearers, he attended the corp&s;e to the family vault at Chi&s;|wick, and there very &s;incerely paid a plentiful tribute of tears to his memory. On his return to town, by way of alleviating his grief, he called in at the Bedford coffee|hou&s;e, when an acquaintance coming up to him, a&s;ked him, if he had not been paying the la&s;t compliment to his friend Holland? "Yes, poor fellow," &s;ays Foote, almo&s;t weeping

<P>Foote being engaged to a rout of lady Harrington's, found the ladies all &s;o thickly &s;eated, that on his entering the drawing-room, he could not get a place to &s;it down in. "Come, Mr. Foote," &s;ays her lady&s;hip, <HI>"you</HI> mu&s;t not be kept &s;tanding, take a chair." "You are very obliging, my lady," &s;ays the wit; "but there appears to me to be more <HI>bottoms</HI> than <HI>chairs</HI> at pre&s;ent about the room."</P>
<P>Lord S&mdash;h, after the fir&s;t day of the naval review at Port&s;mouth, having a&s;ked Foote, Whether &s;uch a profu&s;ion of fire and &s;moke did not give him an idea of hell? Foote replied, Yes; e&s;pecially as I ob&s;erve your lord&s;hip to be in the mid&s;t of it.</P>
<P>At Mr. Fordyce's &s;ale at Roehampton, Foote, who at|tended almo&s;t every day, bought nothing but a <HI>pillow,</HI> on which a gentleman a&s;ked him, what particular u&s;e he could have for a &s;ingle pillow? "Why," &s;ays Foote, "to tell you the truth, I do not &s;leep very well at night, and I am &s;ure this mu&s;t give me many a good nap, when the pro|prietor of it (though he <HI>owed &s;o much)</HI> could &s;leep upon it."</P>
<P>Foote and Garrick being at a tavern together at the time of the fir&s;t regulation of the gold coin, the former pulling out his pur&s;e to pay the reckoning, a&s;ked the latter, "What he &s;hould do with a light guinea he had?" "'P&s;haw, its worth nothing," &s;ays Garrick, <HI>"fling it to the devil."</HI> "Well, David," &s;ays the other, "you are what I always took you for, ever contriving <HI>to make a guinea go further</HI> than any other man."</P>
<P>When Foote heard that Doctor Kenrick was going to give a public critici&s;m on his comedy of the Cozeners, at Marybone, "Well," &s;ays he, "let the Doctor take care of the fate of our fir&s;t parents; <HI>a fall in the garden."</HI></P>
<P>Foote happening to &s;pend the evening with two digni|taries of the church, the conver&s;ation in&s;en&s;ibly turned upon a point of polemical divinity, which the two churchmen took up on different grounds, with great vehemence and &s;trength of argument. Foote, during the conte&s;t, took no other &s;hare in the debate, than in recruiting their &s;pirits, by con&s;tantly keeping their gla&s;&s;es filled: at la&s;t one of them turned about, and begged that as he could be at times as argumentative as witty, he would &s;tep in as arbitrator of their differences.

<P>About three years ago, Foote went to &s;pend his Chri&s;t|mas with the late C&mdash;B&mdash;n, E&s;q; when the wea|ther being very cold, and but bad fires, occa&s;ioned by the &s;carcity of wood in the hou&s;e, Foote was determined to make his vi&s;it as &s;hort as po&s;&s;ible; accordingly, on the third day after he went there, he ordered his chai&s;e, and was preparing to &s;et out for town. Mr. B&mdash;n &s;eeing him with his boots on in the morning, a&s;ked him what hurry he was in, and pre&s;&s;ed him to &s;tay. "No, no" &s;ays Foote, "was I to &s;tay any longer, you would not let me <HI>have a leg to &s;tand on."</HI> "Why &s;ure" &s;ays Mr. B&mdash;n, "we do not drink &s;o <HI>hard."</HI> "No," &s;ays the wit, "but there is &s;o <HI>little</HI> wood in your hou&s;e, that I am afraid one of your &s;ervants may light the fires &s;ome morning with <HI>my right leg."</HI></P>
<P>Foote rattling away one evening in his green-room with great wit and brilliancy, as he u&s;ually did; the Duke of C&mdash;d, who was pre&s;ent, and &s;eemed highly entertain|ed, cried out, "Well, Foote, you &s;ee I &s;wallow all your good things." "Do you, my Lord Duke," &s;ays the other, "why then I congratulate you on your dige&s;tion, for I be|lieve you never <HI>threw up</HI> one of them in your life."</P>
<P>Foote being at &s;upper one night at the Bedford coffee|hou&s;e, ju&s;t after Garrick had performed Macbeth, the con|ver&s;ation very naturally turned on the merits of that great performer, when, after many eulogiums on the univer&s;ality of his powers, it was allowed that he was the fir&s;t actor <HI>on</HI> any <HI>&s;tage.</HI> "Indeed, gentlemen," &s;ays Foote, "I do not think you have &s;aid above <HI>half</HI> enough of him, for I think him not only the <HI>greate&s;t</HI> actor <HI>on,</HI> but <HI>off</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was from this hint, perhaps, Doctor Gold&s;mith took the idea of Garrick's character, in his poem called, Retaliation.</NOTE>the &s;tage."</P>
<P>When Foote was la&s;t in Ireland, he happened to &s;ee at the Ca&s;tle one lev&eacute;e day, a per&s;on in the <HI>&s;uite</HI> of the Lord Lieutenant, whom he thought he had known for many years to have lived rather a life of <HI>expediency</HI> in London; to corroborate his &s;u&s;picion, he a&s;ked Lord Town&s;end who he was? "That is one of my <HI>gentlemen at large,"</HI> &s;ays his Ex|cellency: "Do you know him?" "O yes," &s;ays Foote, "very well, and what you tell me of him is very extraordi|nary; fir&s;t that he is a <HI>gentleman;</HI> and next, that he is <HI>at large."</HI></P>

<P>At the time of the Jubilee at Stratford, planned and conducted by Mr. Garrick, in honour of Shake&s;peare, the weather in general (though early in September) turned out very bad; particularly the day appointed for the public pro|ce&s;&s;ion, which obliged that part of the ceremony to be di&s;|pen&s;ed with. Garrick meeting Foote on the morning of this day in the public breakfa&s;ting room, ju&s;t in the mo|ment of a very heavy &s;hower of rain, "Well, Sam," &s;ays he, rather di&s;appointedly, "What do you think of this?" "Think of it," &s;ays Foote: "Why, I think, it is <HI>God's revenge again&s;t Vanity."</HI></P>
<P>Soon after Savigny (who was a cutler by profe&s;&s;ion) ap|peared at Covent-garden theatre in Barbaro&s;&s;a, Lady Har|rington ob&s;erved to Foote, that he was really very <HI>cutting.</HI> "Oh! dear madam," &s;ays Foote, "I am not much &s;ur|prized at that, con&s;ider he is a <HI>razor grinder."</HI></P>
<P>When Lord Che&s;terfield's letters to his &s;on fir&s;t came out, a gentleman was a&s;king Foote, whether they did not contain great knowledge of the world?

<P>Foote being one night very merry at the Bedford coffee|hou&s;e, the conver&s;ation turned on the abilities of Mr. Gar|rick, as an actor; when, among&s;t many compliments to that celebrated performer, it was ob&s;erved, as &s;omewhat ex|traordinary, that though he was &s;o excellent an actor him|&s;elf, he was far from being lucky in his pupils. "Why, yes," replies Foote, "though the <HI>little</HI> one is a <HI>great</HI> one, he is &s;omething like the famous running-hor&s;e Childers, the be&s;t racer in England <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> but could <HI>never get a colt."</HI></P>

That prince went lately, without attendants, to &s;ee a poor officer, the father of a numerous family. He found him at table with ten of his children, and an orphan, whom he had encumbered him&s;elf with notwith&s;tanding his indigence. The emperor, in &s;ome emotion at this $ight, &s;aid to the officer, I well knew that you had ten children, but to whom does this eleventh belong? It is, an&s;wered the officer, a poor unfortunate child whom I found expo&s;ed at the door of my hou&s;e.

<P>In one of the many engagements in which Prince Eu|gene and the Duke of Marlborough were concerned, it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to call a council of war, in order to de|termine whether it was mo&s;t advi&s;eable to attack the enemy that night, or wait another opportunity: the Prince, toge|ther with the whole council, were unanimous for the at|tack that night; the Duke alone was of a contrary opinion. As the Duke's and the Prince's &s;entiments in regard to all operations had ever coincided, the Prince left the council, not a little di&s;&s;atisfied that they &s;hould differ in the matter before them. After the council broke up, the Duke &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the Prince, and informed him, that he only di&s;gui&s;ed his real &s;entiments in the council, for he perfectly agreed with the Prince for the attack, but, added he, "I knew there were &s;pies in the council."

<HEAD>Whim&s;ical Anecdote of the late Duke of <HI>Newca&s;tle.</HI></HEAD>
<P>At the clo&s;e of the election at Lewes, the late duke of Newca&s;tle was &s;o delighted with the conduct of a ca&s;ting voter, that he almo&s;t <HI>fell upon his neck and ki&s;&s;ed him.</HI>&mdash;"My dear friend! I love you dearly. You're the greate&s;t man in the world. I long to &s;erve you. What can I do for you?"&mdash;"May it plea&s;e your grace, an exci&s;eman of this town is very old: I would beg leave to &s;ucceed him as &s;oon as he &s;hall die."&mdash;"Aye, that you &s;hall with all my heart. I wi&s;h, for your &s;ake, he were dead and buried now. As &s;oon as he is, &s;et out to me, my dear friend: be it night or day, in&s;i&s;t upon &s;eeing me, &s;leeping or waking: If I am not at Claremont, come to Lincoln's-inn fields; if I am not at Lincoln's-inn fields, come to court: if I am not at court, never re&s;t till you find me; not the <HI>&s;anctum &s;anctorum,</HI> or any place, &s;hall be kept &s;acred from &s;uch a dear, worthy, good &s;oul as you are. Nay, I'll give orders for you to be admitted, though the king and I were talking &s;ecrets together in the cabinet."&mdash;The voter &s;wallowed every thing with exta&s;y; and &s;craping down to the very ground, retired to wait in faith for the death of the exci&s;e|man. The latter took his leave of this wicked world in the following winter. As &s;oon as ever the duke's friend was apprized of it, he &s;et off for London, and reached Lin|coln's-inn fields by about two o'clock in the morning. The king of Spain had, about this time, been &s;eized by a di&s;order which &s;ome of the Engli&s;h had been induced to be|lieve, from particular expre&s;&s;es, he could not po&s;&s;ibly &s;ur|vive. Among&s;t the&s;e, the noble duke was the mo&s;t cre|dulous, and probably the mo&s;t anxious. On the very fir&s;t
<PB N="35" REF="36">
moment of receiving his intelligence, he had di&s;patched couriers to Madrid, who were commanded to return with unu&s;ual ha&s;te, as &s;oon as ever the death of his Catholic ma|je&s;ty &s;hould have been announced. Ignorant of the hour in which they might arrive, and impatient of the fate of every hour, the duke would not retire to re&s;t till he had given the &s;tricte&s;t orders to his attendants, to &s;end any per&s;on to his chamber who &s;hould de&s;ire admittance. When the voter a&s;ked if he was at home, he was an&s;wered by the porter&mdash;"Yes; his grace has been in bed &s;ome time, but we were directed to awaken him as &s;oon as ever you came."&mdash;"Ah, God ble&s;s him! I know that the duke always told me I &s;hould be welcome by night or by day. Pray &s;hew me up."&mdash;The happy vi&s;itor was &s;carcely conducted to the door, when he ru&s;hed into the room, and, in the tran&s;port of his joy, cried out, "My lord, he is dead."&mdash;"That's well, my dear friend! I'm glad of it, with all my &s;oul. When did he die?"&mdash;"The morning before la&s;t, and plea&s;e your grace."&mdash;"What? &s;o lately! Why, my worthy good creature, you mu&s;t have flown. The lightening it&s;elf could not travel half &s;o fa&s;t as you. Tell me, you be&s;t of men, how &s;hall I reward you?"&mdash;"All I wi&s;h for, in this world, is, that your grace would plea&s;e to remember your kind promi&s;e, and appoint me to &s;ucceed him."&mdash;"You, you blockhead! You king of Spain! What family preten&s;ions can you have? Let's look at you."&mdash;By this time the a&s;to|ni&s;hed duke threw back the curtains, and recollected the face of his electioneering friend; but it was &s;een with rage and di&s;appointment. To have robbed him of his re&s;t, might ea&s;ily have been forgiven; but to have fed him with a groundle&s;s &s;uppo&s;ition that the king of Spain was dead, be|came a matter of re&s;entment. He was, at fir&s;t, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with all the violence of anger; which pre&s;ently &s;ub&s;iding, his grace, unable to refrain from laughing at the oddity of the mi&s;take, &s;ent for him back, and with great good humour granted his reque&s;t.</P>

Our immortal bard made the following reply. "If your highne&s;s thinks that the calamities which befalls us here, are indications of the wrath of heaven; in what manner are we to account for the fate of the king, your father? The di&s;plea&s;ure of heaven mu&s;t, upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, have been much greater again&s;t <HI>him</HI> than <HI>me,</HI> for I have only lo&s;t my eyes; but he lo&s;t his head."</P>

<P>It is related of Lord Chief Ju&s;tice Holt, who had been very wild in his youth, that being once upon the bench at the Old Bailey, a fellow was tried and convicted of a rob|bery on the highway, whom the judge remembered to have been one of his old companions.
