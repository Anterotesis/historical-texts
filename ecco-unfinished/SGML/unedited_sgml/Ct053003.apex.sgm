<P>_I <HI>Archibald Mac Donald</HI> of <HI>I$verlocky,</HI> being po&s;|&s;e&s;t of the &s;ublime Il|lumination, heredita|ry from many Ance|&s;tors, the bright Ray of Secret Knowledge, conveying to me a true Intelligence in things hidden from mortal View; that &s;uperiour Gift, by which a more inten&s;e Sight of things to come is communicated, and whereby, in &s;acred Raptures, &s;uch Vi|&s;ion

is convey'd as is not only incom|municable, but inexpre&s;&s;ible from one Man to another; al&s;o, I &s;ay, being po&s;&s;e&s;t of this &s;ecret Impre&s;&s;ion of Know|ledge, and excited thereby to &s;earch into the My&s;teries of things unknown; I am likewi&s;e animated thereby, to in|&s;truct Mankind, warn, and forewarn them in things to come: In order whereunto, addre&s;&s;ing my Words with Affection and deep Concern, to all the Enquirers after Knowledge, to who&s;e Souls Wi&s;dom is as Light is to the Eye, <HI>viz.</HI> Solace and Delight, and to whom Ignorance is as Darkne&s;s and Death. Be it known therefore to the Sons of Men, That albeit, by the Ap|pointment and Permi&s;&s;ion of Heaven, hidden and &s;ecret things, otherwi&s;e impenetrable in Nature, are compa&s;&s;ed and under&s;tood by Science, Application of the Mind, inten&s;e Rea&s;oning, and ju&s;t Pur&s;uit of Knowledge; yet that Futurity, the dark re&s;erved Decrees directing and ordering the Revolutions of Times, the Periods and Conjuncti|on of Accidents, determined by the Pre&s;cience of Nature, and fore-appoint|ed to come to pa&s;s; the&s;e are only known to tho&s;e to whom this &s;ublime
<PB N="5" REF="5">
Power of <HI>Vi&s;ion</HI> is granted, as a Gift from on High.</P>
<P>The Gift, by Men called the SE|COND SIGHT, is an unconfin'd, cele&s;tial Ray of Light, empowering Nature, though none knoweth by what Means, to di&s;cern of things to come, frequently operating not only on Per&s;ons terrene, and things &s;ublunary and mortal, but &s;ometimes extended to things cele&s;tial and &s;upernatural, and even to view the Face of the Hea|vens, the Signs cele&s;tial, the elemen|tary Motions and Revolutions of tho&s;e other Worlds the Planets; and in them to &s;ee, not the &s;everal extraordinary Influences only, which they have on things below, known in Part, though dimly, to &s;ome by <HI>A&s;trological</HI> Experi|ments; but al&s;o tho&s;e portentous Sig|nifications which they are &s;tor'd with, which the wi&s;e Men, <HI>Magicians</HI> and <HI>A&s;trologers,</HI> &amp;c. laugh at, and endeavour to e&s;teem vain, becau&s;e they are not able to fathome or di&s;cern them; but to tho&s;e to whom this bright Ray of <HI>Vi&s;ionsry</HI> Knowledge is convey'd, are undoubted and effectually di&s;covered.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="6">
Led by this Ray of &s;upernatural Light it was, that, at Midnight the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Day of the Month of <HI>January,</HI> ri&s;ing from my Bed of Feathers, &s;oft and refre&s;hing to me as Pillows of Down, and &s;tanding on the highe&s;t Pinnacle of the Mountain <HI>Aphlec,</HI> in one of the floating I&s;lands of the mi|raculous <HI>Lough-loman,</HI> I was mov'd to regard the A&s;pect of cele&s;tial Nature.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dancers,</HI> tho&s;e <HI>Igni fatui</HI> of the <HI>Northern</HI> Regions, tho&s;e Lights &s;ound in the Aby&s;s of Darkne&s;s, &s;hone bright|ly with their dazling and un&s;teady Rays, leaving Nature it &s;elf, and all the wi&s;e Di&s;coverers of her mo&s;t &s;ecret Parts, at a Lo&s;s, and in the Dark, to know from whence they proceed. The Stars &s;hone portentous, and with A&s;pect malignant, boding Evil to the doz'd World, gave Notice to me, that I might &s;uddenly expect an extraordi|nary Vi&s;ion of things to come; I had repeated Warnings from &s;ecret Fore|knowledge, that &s;omething dreadful attended.</P>
<P>Expecting, with &s;ome Affliction, what &s;hould offer to an extended Sight, there appeared a va&s;t globular, but dark Body, pa&s;&s;ing &s;wiftly in a cir|cular
<PB N="7" REF="7">
Motion; no Appearance at fir&s;t offering to my Sight, of its being &s;o much as capable of a reflex Light, till pa&s;&s;ing by me in a parallel Po&s;ition, I di&s;cern'd it to be the Body of the Moon, &s;ome time after its Conjunction with the Sun, called by Men the <HI>Change.</HI> I was confirm'd in this being but <HI>Vi&s;ionary,</HI> becau&s;e, by the natural Motion of that Planet, I knew &s;he mu&s;t really be, at that Time, out of my or|dinary Sight; and likewi&s;e the Sun, its ancient Illuminator, being then in the oppo&s;ite Hemi&s;phere: The Appearance pa&s;&s;ed on, took a remote and undi&s;|cernable Motion till the Dawn, when the approaching Light cau&s;ing it to di&s;appear, I received Notice, that I &s;hould, at a certain Di&s;tance of Time, &s;ee the mo&s;t effectual and central Con|junction that had been vi&s;ible to the&s;e Parts of the World, for 800 Years pa&s;t.</P>
<P>By this I found, even as directly as <HI>A&s;tronomers,</HI> by their calculated Tables and Numbers, that the Moon, which was the dark Body &s;o repre&s;ented, was, by her natural Cour&s;e, to pa&s;s in &s;uch a Po&s;ition at her u&s;ual Time in the <HI>Fourth</HI># Change inclu&s;ive from that
<PB N="8" REF="8">
Hour, and which &s;hould be in the Month of <HI>April,</HI> that it &s;hould, for a|bove two Hours, effectually and totally eclyp&s;e and intercept the cele&s;tial Rays of the Sun from this <HI>I&s;land,</HI> e&s;pecially from its <HI>Southern</HI> Parts, and from a great Part of this Hemi&s;phere.</P>
<P>The Illumination di&s;covers to the rarified and exalted Sight, innumerable malignant Influences, which this Con|junction is armed with, Na|ture <FIGURE>
</FIGURE> concurring; nor is the portentous Vi&s;ion any In|terruption to the Nece&s;&s;ity, by which Nature brings to pa&s;s the Conjunction of the <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>Moon,</HI> any more than the &s;aid Conjunction, being natural, forbids that it &s;hould al&s;o be directed to pre|dict Terrors to the World, and parti|cularly to this or that, or any Part thereof.</P>
<P>Alarmed by this Intimation, and moved to watch the great Di&s;covery which, by Vi&s;ion, I expected near my View, I ob&s;erved the Sun withdrawing its benign Rays from the World, and &s;uffering its Fires to expend infinite E|manation of &s;tagnated Vapours, in&s;ecti|ous and &s;uffocating, envigorating the
<PB N="9" REF="9">
Atmo&s;phore of this Earth, and perhaps of all the other Planetary Worlds, with poy&s;onous Atoms, commi&s;&s;ioned by Heaven to ca&s;t their Darts, as they &s;hall be immediately directed.</P>
<P>Hence Plagues, Chronical Di&s;tem|pers, and Contageous Di&s;ea&s;es upon Man and Bea&s;t, &s;uch as have not been felt; Inundations of Water, Tempe&s;ts of Wind, &s;ubterraneous Irruptions of Air, &s;corching Drought, and all the armed Terrors of Nature, &s;tand obe|dient to the heavenly Direction; and though produced by natural Cau&s;es, are neverthele&s;s martialled in &s;uch Or|der, and under &s;uch Directions, as the Great Maker of Nature has determin|ed, or &s;hall determine and direct.</P>
<P>Nor does their being the Product of Nature, in a Manner and Method which Learned Philo&s;ophers can ac|count for, le&s;&s;en the Rea&s;on or Verity of this, that all the&s;e extraordinary Motions and Conjunctions of the hea|venly Bodies have &s;uch Influences, ordinary and extraordinary, on the &s;ublunary World, as their Governour plea&s;es to direct; which as it is rea|&s;onable to Men to believe, &s;o to tho&s;e who have this Gift of &s;upernatural
<PB N="10" REF="10">
Vi&s;ion, the&s;e Influences and Operations, and &s;ometimes the Manner thereof, are more vi&s;ible than Demon&s;tration it &s;elf.</P>
<P>Turning my &s;elf then towards the &s;plendid Dawn, I &s;eem'd to di&s;co|ver <HI>War</HI> with his armed Thou&s;ands, riding &s;uriou&s;ly over the World, and following clo&s;e in the Heels of the dark Body afore&s;aid, of the Moon: He &s;at mounted upon the Sign <HI>Taurus,</HI> or the <HI>Bull,</HI> in which Zodiack Divi&s;ion this Conjunction of the Sun and Moon &s;hall appear. Thus he appears attending, till the fatal Time, when the &s;aid Planets meet, and the Moon &s;hould in &s;uch a Po&s;ition, as &s;hould inter&s;ect the Glorious Rays of the Center of Light. Here <HI>War</HI> advances, as if, at this Time, &s;ummon'd to receive his Commi&s;&s;ion to enflame the World, rai&s;e Commoti|ons, &s;tir up the Pride, Pa&s;&s;ions, and Vices of Mankind, into &s;uch Fermen|tations, as &s;hould i&s;&s;ue in general De|&s;tructions.</P>
<P>He was follow'd by <HI>Death,</HI> a di&s;mal Statue in Shape humane, but erect and tall as to Heaven, floating triumphant on a dark Chariot in a va&s;t Lake of &s;tag|nate Blood, into which emptied them|&s;elves
<PB N="11" REF="11">
Seven Rivers of Blood, flowing from Seven &s;everal and di&s;tant Parts of the World.</P>
<P><HI>Pe&s;tilence</HI> and <HI>Famine</HI> waited at a Di&s;tance, attended with an innumera|ble Crowd, who all came, and &s;tood ready to pay their Homage at the dreadful Lake, to the di&s;mal Statue of Death, Clouds and Darkne&s;s clo&s;ing up the Rear.</P>
<P>While this Appearance, in a terri|ble manner affrighting, agitated my Imagination, the Sun ri&s;e in the Ea&s;t|ern part of the Hemi&s;phere, and &s;hin|ing bright and glorious, proceeded on his Cour&s;e till he almo&s;t touch'd the South-Ea&s;t Point, when the dark Opa|cous Globe afore&s;aid of the Moon in|vi&s;ible till then began to inter&s;ect his Rayes, progre&s;&s;ively re&s;toring Night in the Bloom of Day, di&s;covering the Stars of the other Hemi&s;phere, not &s;een by our Eyes at any time before.</P>
<P>In the Centre of this Circum&s;tance, it clearly appears to the dilated Sight how the &s;everal Parts of the Earth &s;tood influenced, and are &s;ubjected to the fatal Hands of tho&s;e terrible Evils, which received their Commi&s;&s;ion from above, to direct their Malignity to
<PB N="12" REF="12">
tho&s;e Parts of the World to which this Interruption of the heavenly Light was mo&s;t central.</P>
<P>And although the receiving their Commi&s;&s;ion as afore&s;aid, the manner of the Vi&s;ion, and the Orders given to the Plagues, Terrors, and dreadful Evils which threaten the World, are not po&s;&s;ible to be related, and are re|pre&s;ented here as imaginary only; yet &s;omething of what this &s;ublime Vi&s;ion may have been capable of Under&s;tand|ing, as to &s;ub&s;equent Events in the World, may be under&s;tood in the fol|lowing Order.</P>
<P>Elevated in the Place where I &s;tood, as well as lifted up in Soul by the Pow|er of this &s;ecret Illumination, I beheld appearing to the extended Sight dim Rayes of reflex Light &s;treaming conta|geous Fire from the Verges of the Eclyp&s;|ed Sun, and darting upon &s;undry Parts of the Earth, di&s;covering again in tho&s;e Parts the People who are immediately influenced by the portentous effectual Particles of Flame fla&s;hing upon them; in &s;ome Parts this moves one way, in &s;ome another, and re&s;pectively here or there, to rai&s;ing Commotions, forming black and helli&s;h De&s;igns, laying the
<PB N="13" REF="13">
Foundations of Trea&s;on, Con&s;piracy, ambitious Struggles of Great Men one again&s;t another; from thence extend|ing to Princes, Kings, Empires, and Nations; making fatal Breaches in their own Tranquillity, at which dread|ful Cha&s;ms naturally enter War, Con|fu&s;ion, Plagues, and all kinds of Cala|mity, till from tho&s;e Countries again in &s;treaming Rivers the Blood of Nati|ons flows with a direct and united Torrent, into the Great Lake of Death, of which the general Vi&s;ion gave the De&s;cription.

<P><HI>FRANCE</HI> feels the fir&s;t Effects of this Emanation. The fiery <HI>Ef|fluvia</HI> affect the Invincible Monarch, the Immortal Man, and give him &s;un|dry Demon&s;trations of his neither be|ing Invincible or Immortal.

<P>Our exalted View of things to come, is not without a ju&s;t Retro&s;pect on things pa&s;t; and here, by the penetrat|ing Power of this Illumination, is di&s;co|ver'd to me that of things done in the la&s;t Years; the De&s;igns of Men point|ed at different Matters than &s;uch as they pretended: Heaven, for the de|tecting Crime, and &s;tripping the Guil|ty of the Protection of &s;upreme Dig|nity, &s;ummon'd the Prince to re&s;ign, and remov'd the Hand on whom the Scepter of Power was devolv'd.</P>
<P>The Scene of Vi&s;ion changing here, repre&s;ented remote, and a&s;piring a plea&s;ant Clowd, enlighten'd with &s;e|raphick Flame, and &s;urrounding a crowned Appearance, &s;hapele&s;s, but amiable, noting the remov'd Per&s;on exalted and accepted, and declar'd in|nocent of the Mi&s;chiefs de&s;ign'd to the Countries committed to the Rule of her Scepter, tho' politically abu&s;ed, and made to skreen the Crimes of Men, as if they had been her own.</P>
<P>An Opening here appear'd in the Ray cele&s;tial, through which &s;hone a bright, livid Fire, and in the Flame

written, DELIVERANCE and ESTABLISHMENT. From this Ray, importing a Succe&s;&s;ion of Power, enclined to deliver a betray'd Nation, and to e&s;tabli&s;h Peace on the Foundations of Liberty and Civil Right.</P>
<P>Before this penetrating Ray, Guilt fled as Darkne&s;s before the Sun, and the Enemies of the new Throne came in daily, offering Submi&s;&s;ion, and pe|nitential Confe&s;&s;ions; Ju&s;tice &s;at on the Right Hand, cloath'd with Emi|nency; and yet &s;haking Hands with Clemency, and with Power irre&s;i&s;ti|ble, re&s;tored the Nation.</P>
<P>Yet, after all this Felicity, there ap|pears impending Darkne&s;s, and Clowds hover, and Storms gathering, threat|ned a&s;flicting things to a People un|thankful for Deliverances, often en|joy'd by Wonders. Wi&s;dom, Prudence, and Integrity reigns; but Heaven is not always appeas'd that Way; a ju&s;t Power over an unthankful People doubles the Ingratitude, and alarms &s;overeign Power to &s;ummon his Ven|geance for their Correction.</P>

I fear, at the looking through this fir&s;t Glorious Light, I &s;ay I fear, the ri&s;ing Vi&s;ion flamed with Tokens of Judgments, which eclyp&s;e our Joy.

<P>Advancing now, there repre&s;ents to my View dark and thick Re&s;emblan|ces, &s;ignifying Di&s;contents, Murmurs, and Unea&s;ine&s;s of People, rather at one another, than at their Sovereign; &s;triv|ing, with inveterate Rage, to over|throw and &s;upplant one another.</P>
<P>The vi&s;ion repre&s;ents this &s;preading over the Center of the Nation. On the fir&s;t view, it threatned War and Civil Broil; but the penetrating Sight having a view beyond pre&s;ent things, there appears the Sovereign, ve&s;ted not only with Power enough to quell, but with Temper, Wi&s;dom, and Coun|cil, to calm the Tempe&s;ts of Mens Minds on either Side. This being from Heaven communicated as a Branch

<P>Yet it appears, this Contention &s;hall be pu&s;h'd on with as much vigor, Ea|gerne&s;s, and Fury, as if it had been the mortal Strife of a Civil War.</P>
<P>Great Strivings of Cour&s;e fall in here, to make the Oppo&s;ition of one Side be thought Rebellion again&s;t the Prince, and to be puni&s;hed as &s;uch. In this the Succe&s;s does not an&s;wer the De&s;ign; for Intere&s;t of private Ambition &s;eparating Men from Truth, and dive&s;ting them of the Principles of Honour and Ju&s;tice, di&s;covers that evil Men guide the Publick, under Pretence of Good, in all Ages, and among all Parties.</P>
<P>A piercing Fla&s;h, which &s;truck Light through otherwi&s;e impenetrable Darkne&s;s and Clowd, di&s;covered to me, that the Prince, exalted by Hea|ven, &s;hall, with a piercing Eve, per|ceive Deceit, Hypocri&s;y, and &s;elfi&s;h Principles, to be the Pole-&s;tar of every Party; and that the mo&s;t Pretending have remote views, which they pur&s;ue

with a Re&s;erve of Ambition and Pride, covered with the &s;pecious Clothing of publick Zeal.</P>
<P>This Penetration given from Hea|ven, alarms the Prince to &s;uppre&s;s con|tending Parties, by a &s;trong Arm; tak|ing the Reins of Government into his own Hands, and letting the contending People know, they are no longer to be the Implements of vanity and Lu&s;t, in the Hands of ambitious Men, by whom they are made a Prey; but that they may operate in their own Deliverance, under his Protection. Happy Nation! if this Day &s;hall e|ver come: May the vi&s;ion not fail in this Part, whatever el&s;e may be un|certain. <HI>Happy</HI> had this Scene been acted in Years behind us, then had Civil Peace covered <HI>Britain,</HI> as the Waters cover the Sea; Rivers of Blood had not &s;treamed from this I|&s;land, as from a Fountain &s;upplying the great Lake of Death; the Strife of Men had never ri&s;en to tho&s;e Heights, as to eclyp&s;e the Light of Rea&s;on, trampling under Foot Peace, Truth, Charity, good Manners, and even natural Affection.</P>
