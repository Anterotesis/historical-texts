<P>AS the power of a &s;tate con&s;i&s;ts chiefly
in the number and indu&s;try of its
people, every thing mu&s;t be of im|portance
that contributes to the&s;e ends. This
ob&s;ervation puts the linen manufacture in a
con&s;picuous light; for it employs many
hands, and requires the mo&s;t painful indu|&s;try.
In Scotland, this manufacture, which,
within the memory of man, &s;carce de&s;erved
the name, has of late years made a progre&s;s &s;o
rapid, as to become our chief manufacture,
circulating more money than all our other
manufactures in conjunction. Nor is there
any &s;ymptom of its being &s;tationary: on the
contrary, it is every year boldly advancing
with wider and wider &s;teps.</P>
<P>This pro&s;pect mu&s;t be agreeable to every

well-hearted Briton; and to gratify the lau|dable

<P>Though the progre&s;s of the linen manu|facture
in general is not the profe&s;&s;ed pur|po&s;e
of this paper, yet I &s;hall endeavour to
account for it, as a proper introduction to a
hi&s;torical narrative of the mea&s;ures taken by
the Tru&s;tees for promoting our flax-hu&s;band|ry.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4">
The union of the two crowns of England
and Scotland, was a fatal event for the latter.
The great increa&s;e of power which our kings
thereby acquired, reduced the Scotch nobility
to a &s;tate of humble dependence. From being
petty monarchs, they became &s;laves to the
crown, and had nothing left to &s;upport their
accu&s;tomed dignity, but, under protection of
the crown, to en&s;lave their inferiors. The na|tional
&s;pirit, bold and brave, &s;ub&s;ided by de|grees;
and a general torpor &s;ucceeded, the
never-failing effect of &s;lavery. Though re&s;to|red
to liberty and independence, by the u|nion
of the two nations, yet mutual jealou&s;y
and enmity ob&s;tructed long the advantages
of our new &s;ituation. At length the ble&s;&s;ings
of liberty and independence became con&s;pi|cuous,
and invigorated multitudes to exert
them&s;elves in laudable undertakings. And
hence that &s;pirit for improvement in Scot|land,
di&s;played upon hu&s;bandry, upon ma|nufactures,
upon commerce, and upon lite|rature.</P>
<P>The e&s;tabli&s;hing a board of Tru&s;tees for
directing this national &s;pirit, upon fi&s;heries,
and upon the manufactures of linen and
woollen, was a mea&s;ure wi&s;e and political,
zealou&s;ly promoted by a worthy patriot, who
<PB N="6" REF="5">
was rewarded, by the opportunity he long
had of &s;erving his country, as an eminent
member of that board. His &s;tatue was erect|ed
in the &s;enate-hou&s;e, by tho&s;e of his own
profe&s;&s;ion, in token of their veneration for
him, as a judge above all corruption. From
his fellow-citizens in general a &s;tatue was not
le&s;s due, as a token of their gratitude for
his patrioti&s;m.</P>
<P>But whatever was his zeal for the public
good, and whatever zeal he in&s;pired into
others, yet the operations of that board were
not at fir&s;t attended with great &s;ucce&s;s. The
indolence and ignorance of the low people,
and their want of hone&s;ty, could not be cured
but by per&s;everance and artful management.
But unluckily we were at that time ill pro|vided
with political phy&s;icians, &s;killed in the
cure: which is always the ca&s;e in a country
where indu&s;try is dead, and no per&s;on thinks
of it. The Tru&s;tees were forced for &s;ome
time to grope in the twilight of knowledge:
they frequently mi&s;took their road, and ad|opted
mea&s;ures that were not always ade|quate
to the ends propo&s;ed. But, as the in|tendment
of this paper is neither to make a
&s;atire nor encomium upon the Tru&s;tees, it
&s;hall only be ob&s;erved in pa&s;&s;ing, that the ig|norance
<PB N="7" REF="6">
of this nation with re&s;pect to manu|factures,
and with re&s;pect to the means of
promoting them, may well excu&s;e the few
errors committed by the Tru&s;tees at the
commencement of their management; and
that the&s;e errors ought not to derogate from
their merit, in &s;erving their country without
the &s;lighte&s;t motive of private intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The Tru&s;tees, having with great a&s;&s;iduity
&s;urmounted endle&s;s difficulties and ob&s;truc|tions,
were encouraged to redouble their di|ligence.
The people are in a mea&s;ure reclaim|ed
from idlene&s;s and di&s;hone&s;ty: indu&s;try is
gaining ground, and is &s;preading even to di|&s;tant
corners: &s;pinners and weavers, greatly
multiplied, are daily acquiring more and
more &s;kill: many bleachfields are perfected,
and the colour of our linens is much impro|ved;
nor have water-mills been neglected for
dre&s;&s;ing flax of our own growth; though
the&s;e, after much expence be&s;towed, do not
now give general &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>The&s;e expen&s;ive articles drew great &s;ums
from the Tru&s;tees; &s;o great, that little was
left for promoting other branches. But the&s;e
articles being now far advanced, &s;o as not to
require much further &s;upport, it is the inten|tion
of the Tru&s;tees to promote the growth of
<PB N="8" REF="7">
our own flax with their utmo&s;t a&s;&s;iduity.
This appears the proper time for encouraging
that capital article, becau&s;e a market is now
provided for it, <HI>viz.</HI> a home market, which
of all is the be&s;t; and no per&s;on can doubt of
this market when he is informed, that foreign
flax to the amount of <HI>L.</HI> 110,000 is yearly
imported into Scotland.</P>
<P>The &s;aving this annual &s;um to the nation,
is not the only, nor indeed the greate&s;t bene|fit
that will accrue by promoting flax-hu&s;|bandry.
A manufacture cannot but be upon
a precarious footing, when recour&s;e mu&s;t be
had to a foreign market for the crude mate|rials;
and a nation mu&s;t be upon a pre|carious
footing, when it is in the power
of foreigners, with a &s;ingle <HI>Fiat,</HI> to &s;tarve a
great proportion of its people, by withdrawing
from them the means of labour. This ob&s;er|vation
is in part unhappily verified by the
pre&s;ent &s;tate of our flax-commerce; for fo|reign
flax has, within the&s;e &s;even years, been
gradually &s;o much rai&s;ed upon us, that we
pay now for it fifty <HI>per cent.</HI> more than for|merly.
<HI>2dly,</HI> For a further encouragement
to rai&s;e flax, the farmer may be a&s;&s;ured, that
our own flax, when &s;kilfully managed, and
the ground well prepared, is tough, compact,
<PB N="9" REF="8">
and &s;mooth; and con&s;equently, for thread,
lace, gauze, cambric, and lawn, is better
fitted than that of Holland, which generally
is &s;pungy and cottony. Scotch flax, when
brought to its utmo&s;t perfection, may proba|bly
rival even that of Flanders. It is too
good for O&s;naburgs, which require coar&s;e
Ru&s;&s;ian flax. The Dutch flax is only prefer|able
for thick hollands. <HI>3dly,</HI> All the labour
be&s;towed upon foreign flax purcha&s;ed by us,
in preparing the ground, in &s;owing and pull|ing,
in watering, gra&s;ing, and dre&s;&s;ing for
the heckle, is paid for by us. What a bene|fit
to this nation mu&s;t it be, to give bread to
numbers of our own people, by employing
them in that work? <HI>4thly,</HI> As a con&s;iderable
proportion of the flax we u&s;e is of foreign
growth, and as the heckler and the &s;pinner
mu&s;t pay money for it, the one is di&s;po&s;ed
to over-heckle it, and the other to draw it out
into too fine yarn, in order to make the mo&s;t
of their money. This evil would be in a
good mea&s;ure prevented by having flax in
plenty of our own growth; for the heckler
and &s;pinner would in that ca&s;e u&s;e it freely,
without labouring to draw it beyond its
gri&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9">
The Tru&s;tees, for the&s;e rea&s;ons, cannot di|rect
their management to a more important
object than to that of flax-rai&s;ing. This in|deed
they had early in view, though they did
not always hit upon the mo&s;t effectual means.
They brought flax-rai&s;ers and flax-dre&s;&s;ers
from Holland, Flanders, and England: they
publi&s;hed directions for rai&s;ing flax: they
laid out money for breeding apprentices to
flax-rai&s;ing and flax-dre&s;&s;ing: they encoura|ged
the erection of lint-mills; gave &s;alaries
to &s;tationed rai&s;ers and dre&s;&s;ers of flax, and
di&s;tributed heckles. The article la&s;t men|tioned
did good, and continues to do good:
but mo&s;t of the other articles were le&s;s &s;uc|ce&s;sful
than was expected; becau&s;e the Tru|&s;tees,
inflamed with the &s;pirit of patrioti&s;m,
made a more rapid progre&s;s than was con|&s;i&s;tent
with the circum&s;tances of the country.
For one in&s;tance, it &s;eldom happens that the
be&s;t arti&s;ts are moved by the hope of greater
gain to de&s;ert their native country; and
therefore to &s;end &s;ome hopeful young men
abroad to be thoroughly perfected in the art,
is a mea&s;ure more &s;low indeed, but always
more &s;ucce&s;sful. And had this method been
followed, the &s;uperior &s;kill of the men thus
<PB N="11" REF="10">
educated would have procured them good
bread, without burdening the public fund
with &s;alaries. By neglecting this &s;afe mea|&s;ure,
there were few or no &s;kilful per&s;ons
that could be employed as &s;tationary rai&s;ers
and dre&s;&s;ers of flax; and the Tru&s;tees were
forced to take up with &s;uch per&s;ons as could
procure the be&s;t recommendations; which
generally proceeded from intere&s;ted motives.
The negligence, accordingly, and un&s;kilful|ne&s;s
of the&s;e per&s;ons, ruined all.</P>
<P>One of the encouragements for flax-rai&s;ing,
was a premium of fifteen &s;hillings upon every
acre prepared for flax-&s;eed according to a me|thod
pre&s;cribed. This premium was in ef|fect
putting the plough before the hor&s;es. It
indeed excited many to &s;ow lint-&s;eed; but it
was &s;oon di&s;covered, and might have been
fore&s;een, that it was no &s;ufficient encourage|ment,
without providing a market for the
flax when &s;eparated from the ground. The
premium was not the half of the price of the
&s;eed: the product lay upon the farmer's
hand, who had neither &s;kill nor people for
dre&s;&s;ing it with &s;tock and hand, lint-mills be|ing
at that time extremely rare; and, by
the&s;e means, he was upon the whole a great
lo&s;er by this premium.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11" MS="Y">
Lint-boors came next in play, by a hint
taken from Holland and Flanders. The lint-boors
there purcha&s;e all the green lint in the
neighbourhood, water and gra&s;e it, and, in
a word, prepare it for the &s;pinner. This
mea&s;ure had a fair appearance; the Tru&s;tees
were fond of it, and gave great encourage|ment
for carrying it into execution. But
this mea&s;ure proved abortive; and it could
not happen otherwi&s;e. It was not adverted
to, that the culture of flax had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in
Holland and Flanders for centuries; and that
con&s;iderable &s;tocks were acquired by dealing
in the different branches of the manufacture;
part of which could not be better employed
than in the lucrative trade of a lint-boor, &s;ur|rounded
with lint-fields, that &s;ave the expence
of carriage. In Scotland every article was
oppo&s;ite. The manufacture was &s;till in its
infancy: no provi&s;ion of &s;kilful hands: lint-fields
were thinly &s;cattered; and it was a
great burden upon the lint-boor to carry &s;o
weighty a crop from a great di&s;tance: no
per&s;on had a &s;tock for building hou&s;es, pre|paring
canals, <HI>&amp;c.;</HI> and had there been &s;uch
per&s;ons, they would not have &s;tooped to an
inferior branch, while the higher branches
lay open to employ their money upon.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="12">
The water-mills mentioned above, having
a &s;pecious appearance, met with vigorous en|couragement,
and exhau&s;ted a great deal of
public money. They were favourites of the
country-people, by &s;aving labour in dre&s;&s;ing
the flax; of which tho&s;e were the mo&s;t &s;en|&s;ible
who were acquainted with the &s;lowne&s;s
and fatigue of the &s;tock and hand. It was
not doubted but that the&s;e mills would in|cline
every farmer to rai&s;e flax; and the Tru|&s;tees
were intent to accelerate that effect. A
premium was notified of eighteen pence <HI>per</HI>
&s;tone for dre&s;&s;ed flax of our own growth;
which was confined to the three great linen
counties of Perth, Fife, and Angus, becau&s;e
the public fund was not adequate to a more
general premium. The &s;ucce&s;s of this mea|&s;ure
has been con&s;iderable; and would have
been &s;till more con&s;iderable, had a &s;ufficient
number of &s;kilful flax-rai&s;ers been provided
to in&s;truct the country-people. The demand
for foreign flax has greatly &s;ub&s;ided in the&s;e
counties; and in a few years will probably
vani&s;h altogether. This premium is now
tran&s;ferred to the counties of Lanark, Air,
Renfrew, Dumbarton, and Stirling, where it
will certainly produce the &s;ame beneficial ef|fects;
<PB N="14" REF="13">
and the intention is, to carry it progre&s;|&s;ively
through the kingdom.</P>
<P>For the &s;ame purpo&s;e of promoting flax-rai|&s;ing,
quantities of lint-&s;eed have been di&s;tri|buted,
mo&s;tly in the Highlands, at fir&s;t <HI>gra|tis,</HI>
and afterward under prime co&s;t. This
mea&s;ure had a good effect; but not equiva|lent
to the &s;ums be&s;towed upon it. For the
farmers were not &s;ufficiently &s;killed in pre|paring
the ground: and they were not &s;uffi|ciently
anxious to be in&s;tructed, becau&s;e they
put little value upon &s;eed which they got for
nothing, or at a low price.</P>
<P>To remedy this evil, and to excite a &s;pirit
of cultivation, large premiums were given
for the greate&s;t quantities of flax produced
upon an acre. This inflamed the indu&s;try
of the farmer, and had the effect of pro|curing
very rich crops. Some farmers be|came
expert in high dre&s;&s;ing for flax-&s;eed,
and every one was fond to receive in&s;truc|tion;
which was the great object of the pre|mium.
And yet the Tru&s;tees were forced to
drop this premium, though with great re|luctance,
before the effect was completed.
Indu&s;try was not &s;o far advanced as to
have reclaimed entirely the labouring poor
<PB N="15" REF="14">
from trick and deceit. The premiums were
con&s;iderable; and if, upon the one hand,
they promoted good hu&s;bandry, they, on the
other, were a temptation to practi&s;e fraudu|lent
methods for obtaining fal&s;e reports of the
quantities of flax produced. Such frauds
are infectious; and the Tru&s;tees &s;aw no o|ther
means to prevent the infection, but to
withdraw the bounty altogether. There is
no rea&s;on however to repent of having &s;et
this mea&s;ure on foot; for though it may not
have had the complete effect intended, it
has undoubtedly promoted &s;kill in flax-hu&s;|bandry,
and has al&s;o given &s;ufficient evidence
to the flax-farmer, that plentiful crops can be
produced by high cultivation.</P>
<P>To proceed in the hi&s;tory of water-mills,
experience di&s;covered that they were attended
with many inconveniencies. The labour of
carrying rough lint to the&s;e mills from a di|&s;tance,
came to be felt; as al&s;o the delay of
getting the lint dre&s;&s;ed, when the mill happens
to be much employed. At the &s;ame time,
the ordinary yield of this mill in dre&s;&s;ed flax,
is &s;o much inferior in quantity to that of
&s;tock and hand, as to overbalance fully what
is &s;aved upon labour; not to mention the
hurt that is done to the flax by the violent
<PB N="16" REF="15">
and ill-directed action of the mill. But the
wor&s;t of all is, that the lint-miller, being un|der
no check nor control, is tempted to de|fraud
his cu&s;tomers of part of their dre&s;&s;ed
flax: and there are in&s;tances where the whole
has been with-held from poor people, who it
was thought would not have courage to bring
a law-&s;uit. In many places there is not &s;uffi|cient
hou&s;e-room provided for the flax that is
brought to the mill; which, in a throng
time, is often expo&s;ed to the air for months
together before the miller can reach it. By
the&s;e means, many lint-millers, I am far
from &s;aying the whole, are &s;o &s;unk in their
credit, that the farmers in their neighbour|hood,
rather than &s;ubmit to the foregoing
hard&s;hips, chu&s;e to abandon flax-rai&s;ing alto|gether.</P>
<P>It is peculiarly lucky for Scotland, that, du|ring
this di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ituation, a flax-machine
has been invented, that promi&s;es not only to
remedy the &s;aid inconveniencies, but al&s;o to
advance flax-dre&s;&s;ing to its perfection, with no
le&s;s frugality than expedition. It is wrought
by a &s;ingle hand, takes up little room, is
portable in a cart, and &s;o little expen&s;ive, that
three or four neighbouring farmers may have
one in common for a mere trifle contributed
<PB N="17" REF="16">
by each. Its motion, at the &s;ame time, is &s;o
ea&s;y, and &s;o much under command, that it is
equal to &s;tock and hand with re&s;pect to the
yield of dre&s;&s;ed flax, and al&s;o with re&s;pect to
the gentlene&s;s of its motions. And taking
into the account the expedition of this ma|chine,
which performs at lea&s;t thrice the work
of &s;tock and hand, it mu&s;t be pronounced a
happy invention.</P>
<P>But we have not exhau&s;ted all that can be
&s;aid in its favour, nor indeed the greater part.
It is a capital advantage, that by it the farmer
can &s;uperintend the dre&s;&s;ing his flax without
hazard of being cheated; and, what is &s;till
more, to get his flax dre&s;&s;ed without a far|thing
of charge; which may be done by the
following method. The flax is generally wa|tered
and gra&s;ed before the corn-harve&s;t, or
at lea&s;t before it turn throng; and therefore
may be done by the farm-&s;ervants, without
interrupting other work. The flax may be
hou&s;ed at the end of a barn or other conveni|ent
place till winter, when the farm-&s;ervants,
for want of light, are laid idle for &s;ome
hours in the afternoon. During this time,
the farmer and his &s;ervants cannot be more
profitably employed than in dre&s;&s;ing their flax;
and the long nights afford more than &s;uffi|cient
<PB N="18" REF="17">
time for dre&s;&s;ing all that will be rai&s;ed
by a knot of neighbouring farmers. And
even &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;wifte&s;t progre&s;s of lint|hu&s;bandry,
every farmer may afford to pur|cha&s;e
a machine for his own u&s;e &s;olely, which
may be employed, not only during the dark
hours of the afternoon, but frequently in
day-light, when bad weather forbids all field-operations.</P>
<P>It is difficult, I am &s;en&s;ible, to entice peo|ple
to employ in labour their accu&s;tomed idle
hours; but addre&s;s and per&s;everance will
conquer many difficulties. And to operate
this conver&s;ion of idlene&s;s into labour, there
is one means among many that cannot fail of
&s;ucce&s;s. An article is commonly &s;tipulated by
farm-&s;ervants as part of their wages, which
is, to have ground allotted them for &s;owing
&s;ome lint-&s;eed. They are generally put off
with the wor&s;t &s;oil, ill prepared: their crops
are &s;canty: the expence of dre&s;&s;ing uncon&s;ci|onable:
and &s;tating every article by a ju&s;t
calcul, lint purcha&s;ed at a market would
come cheaper to them than what they thus
procure. To engage them to work at the ma|chine,
no more is nece&s;&s;ary but that the
farmer take them in as partners. He has, for
example, one hog&s;head of lint-&s;eed; they ano|ther
<PB N="19" REF="18">
among them. Let it be all &s;own pro|mi&s;cuou&s;ly
in the &s;ame field; upon which,
for his own &s;ake, the farmer will be&s;tow the
highe&s;t dre&s;&s;ing. It is watered in common,
gra&s;ed in common, and dre&s;&s;ed in common.
When a divi&s;ion is made in proportion to the
quantities &s;own, the poor labourers will re|joice
in a double increa&s;e, purcha&s;ed with a
little additional labour, without any expence.
Far from grudging this labour, their conve|ning
together in one place, with a fire for dry|ing
the flax, will afford them high amu&s;e|ment.
Their labour will be ea&s;y, being di|vided
among many hands, and it is fit that
the farmer encourage them by taking part in
the labour. A little care, at the &s;ame time,
with proper lanterns, &s;uch as are u&s;ed in
heckling, will remove all hazard of fire; e|&s;pecially
if the farmer him&s;elf take a narrow
&s;urvey every evening when the &s;ervants leave
off work.</P>
<P>Though the dre&s;&s;ing of flax by this ma|chine
requires not more &s;kill than by &s;tock
and hand, yet to &s;how the management of
it, particularly the dexterous handling of
the flax, and to in&s;truct the country-people
in the preceding articles of chu&s;ing and pre|paring
ground, weeding, pulling, watering,
<PB N="20" REF="19">
and gra&s;ing, it mu&s;t be of con&s;equence that
the Tru&s;tees educate and employ in different
parts a number of itinerants. This method
of having the flax dre&s;&s;ed by the country-&s;er|vants
in their otherwi&s;e idle hours, is far &s;u|perior
to that of lint-boors, even &s;uppo&s;ing
we were ripe for the&s;e arti&s;ts; becau&s;e by no
other means is it po&s;&s;ible to get flax dre&s;&s;ed
without expence, and indeed without any la|bour
that can be reckoned upon. The ex|pence
of dre&s;&s;ing has hitherto been a bulky
article; and, con&s;idering the wa&s;te occa&s;ioned
by water-mills, is perhaps not under 40 <HI>per
cent.</HI> of the flax; all of which may be &s;aved
by the machine under con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Though few of the mea&s;ures laid down by
the Tru&s;tees for promoting flax-hu&s;bandry,
have corre&s;ponded to the &s;anguine hopes at
fir&s;t conceived of them; yet the&s;e mea&s;ures,
imperfect as they were, contributed con&s;ider|ably
to the flax-hu&s;bandry, which is farther
advanced than is commonly thought. The va|lue
of flax annually produced in Scotland, af|ter
it is heckled, and ready for the &s;pinner, may
be pretty nearly a&s;certained as follows. The
linen cloth now made in a year amounts to
about <HI>L.</HI> 700,000; the value of the thread
manufactured in a year cannot be le&s;s than
<PB N="21" REF="20">
<HI>L.</HI> 100,000; we are more uncertain about
the quantity of the linen yarn exported; but
we cannot be far wrong in &s;tating it at ano|ther
<HI>L.</HI> 100,000: and the&s;e articles amount
in whole to <HI>L.</HI> 900,000. The next point is, to
a&s;certain the value of heckled flax u&s;ed in
the&s;e different articles. Taking all the diffe|rent
kinds of linen cloth at an average, the
value of the heckled flax may be about a
third; and the proportion is rather more in
thread. Of the yarn exported, the value of
the flax cannot be much below the half.
Joining the&s;e particulars together, the value
of the heckled flax annually manufactured in
Scotland amounts to <HI>L.</HI> 316,666. Subtract
the value of the flax imported, and the price
of heckling it, which is performed at home,
computed to <HI>L.</HI> 125,000, the remainder,
<HI>L.</HI> 191,666, or <HI>L.</HI> 190,000 in round num|bers,
is the value of the heckled flax from our
own growth.</P>
<P>The purpo&s;e of this paper is, to encourage
land-holders and farmers to apply vigorou&s;ly
to flax-rai&s;ing, which, from what is &s;aid a|bove,
will appear equally beneficial to them|&s;elves
and to their country. The Tru&s;tees
&s;truggled at fir&s;t with many difficulties; the
ignorance, the idlene&s;s, the indocility of the
<PB N="22" REF="21">
people. But happily the&s;e difficulties are in a
mea&s;ure &s;urmounted. There are not wanting
hands expert in rai&s;ing and dre&s;&s;ing flax;
and the Tru&s;tees are bent upon increa&s;ing
their number. To deal in this article, the en|couragement
mu&s;t be great, when there is a
market at home; and there mu&s;t always be
&s;uch a market while importation continues.
The late premiums for the greate&s;t quantity
of flax upon an acre, have &s;pread the art of
preparing land for flax-&s;eed; and reiterated
experiments of the great produce of flax
from high dre&s;&s;ing, mu&s;t rou&s;e every farmer.
The bounty of eighteen pence <HI>per</HI> &s;tone for
dre&s;&s;ed flax, though limited to a few coun|ties,
will in time make its progre&s;s through
every county; and farmers, if they regard
their intere&s;t, will early prepare for receiving
the benefit of this bounty when it reaches
them. But of all encouragements for flax-rai&s;ing,
that of the new machine is in reality
the greate&s;t; by preventing a great wa&s;te of
flax, by re&s;cuing farmers out of the fraudu|lent
hands of lint-millers, and by &s;aving an
endle&s;s expence formerly laid out for bring|ing
lint to the heckle. In u&s;ing this machine,
a farmer &s;uperintends the dre&s;&s;ing his own
flax; it is done by his own &s;ervants when
<PB N="23" REF="22">
they cannot be otherwi&s;e employed; and it
is done without expence. A crop of flax, of
all the mo&s;t lucrative, will by the&s;e means
pay a con&s;iderable part of the rent, and
make quicker returns of money than mo&s;t o|ther
crops. Nor ought it to be overlooked,
that the finding employment for &s;ervants
when they would otherwi&s;e be idle, comes to
the &s;ame with le&s;&s;ening their wages. The
Tru&s;tees will &s;catter a few of the&s;e machines
<HI>gratis</HI> in different quarters to &s;erve as models.
The machine is of ea&s;y con&s;truction, and
can be correctly copied by any good work|man.</P>
<P>It is zealou&s;ly to be wi&s;hed, and may rea|&s;onably
be expected, that flax-rai&s;ing will be
greatly promoted by this machine, and will
creep into every corner. But there is &s;ome|thing
&s;till wanting to complete the encourage|ment;
and that is, a ready market for the flax
when it is prepared for the heckle. To that
end the Tru&s;tees will con&s;ider whether it may
not be proper to appoint lint-markets in cer|tain
counties, where buyers and &s;ellers may
re&s;ort; and to proclaim premiums for the
greate&s;t quantities of flax brought by indivi|duals
to the&s;e markets; and we cannot copy
a better model than the premiums given for
<PB N="24" REF="23">
improving the &s;taple of our wool, a regula|tion
that has a fine effect. It is &s;ubmitted,
whether it may not be proper to begin with
appointing three or four markets within the
five we&s;tern counties, which at pre&s;ent enjoy
the bounty of eighteen pence <HI>per</HI> &s;tone for
home flax; becau&s;e frauds that may be com|mitted
in claiming the propo&s;ed premiums,
will be ea&s;ily checked by the itinerant rai&s;ers
and dre&s;&s;ers of flax appointed for in&s;tructing
the people in the&s;e counties. The Tru&s;tees
will al&s;o con&s;ider, whether it may not be u&s;e|ful
to proclaim at the &s;ame time flax-fairs in
central places of other counties, a&s;&s;uring the
inhabitants of the premium in their cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Having di&s;cu&s;&s;ed flax-rai&s;ing, we &s;hall &s;ub|join
an appendix regarding the linen manu|facture
in general. As this manufacture is
now advanced much beyond what is nece&s;&s;ary
for our own con&s;umpt, it is the duty of the
Tru&s;tees to attend to the commerce of that
commodity, and to u&s;e their endeavours to
put it upon the be&s;t footing. To form a &s;o|lid
judgment upon this important &s;ubject, one
mu&s;t be previou&s;ly acquainted with the man|ner
in which that commerce is carried on
at pre&s;ent; a brief view of which is as fol|lows.
London is our capital market: our
<PB N="25" REF="24">
linens are con&s;igned to factors who &s;ell upon
time: to them it is of little con&s;equence what
the price be, or whether punctual payment be
made, becau&s;e they remit only what money
they receive: commi&s;&s;ion and other charges
are &s;ubtracted; which, with &s;low payments,
is a grievous burden upon the dealers in this
country. Of a commerce carried on in this
manner, the natural and nece&s;&s;ary effect with
re&s;pect to the dealers here, is to confine it to
tho&s;e who have large &s;tocks, and can afford to
lie out of their money. This &s;tate of our
linen-commerce mu&s;t cramp the manufacture
exceedingly: it is in effect a monopoly, and
a monopoly of the very &s;tricte&s;t kind, confi|ning
manufacturers to the whole&s;ale-dealer
who lives among them, or in their neigh|bourhood;
for to try all the dealers where a
&s;ingle web only is to be &s;old, would be a
great wa&s;te of time, with little pro&s;pect of a
better price. There are, it is true, &s;ome
petty dealers engaged in this commerce,
known by the name of <HI>hawkers,</HI> who afford
to the weaver &s;ome &s;light relief again&s;t this
&s;lavi&s;h dependence. The&s;e men lay out their
&s;mall &s;tocks in picking up linen cloth as it
comes from the loom; which they al&s;o mu&s;t
&s;ell to the whole&s;ale-man, for they cannot af|ford
<PB N="26" REF="25">
to deal directly with London. But be|ing
better able than a weaver with a &s;ingle
web, to cope with the whole&s;ale-dealers, and
having more knowledge of the trade, they ge|nerally
obtain a more equal price, becau&s;e
they can change about if they be ill treated.
Hence it is, that the&s;e hawkers are no fa|vourites
of the whole&s;ale-men; which re|markably
appeared in an application to the
board of Tru&s;tees, inveighing bitterly again&s;t
hawkers, and calling forth the vengeance of
the board upon them, as de&s;tructive to the
manufacture. It was po&s;&s;ibly imagined, that
the Tru&s;tees might have overlooked a maxim
of which none are ignorant, viz. That the
more numerous purcha&s;ers are, the better for
the manufacture. But this incident may
ju&s;tly give rea&s;on to apprehend a combina|tion
among the whole&s;ale-dealers to de&s;troy
hawkers: an agreement not to purcha&s;e from
them, or to keep down the price, will pro|duce
that effect; and, by this &s;imple means,
the whole trade may be monopolized by the
great dealers without a competitor.</P>
<P>The plan that bids the faire&s;t for putting
this commerce upon its mo&s;t advantageous
footing, is, that there be four linen fairs held
annually at Edinburgh, as the mo&s;t central
<PB N="27" REF="26">
place, each of them to continue four or five
days; which will naturally produce a con|&s;iderable
circulation of ready money, and
con&s;equently afford the poor manufacturer
&s;ome in&s;tant relief for carrying on his bu&s;i|ne&s;s.
We indeed can &s;carce hope for com|mi&s;&s;ions
from whole&s;ale-merchants in Lon|don,
who have linen-drapers at hand to fur|ni&s;h
them goods for completing their a&s;&s;ort|ments.
But an in&s;tance &s;omewhat &s;imilar,
gives encouragement to hope that other
Engli&s;h dealers may re&s;ort to our fairs.
When the commerce of black cattle was laid
open by the union, our people carried their
droves to England: but expence of travel|ling,
and fluctuation of markets, made this a
precarious and hazardous commerce, and
reduced to bankruptcy many of our drovers.
At length the pro&s;pect of choice and cheap|ne&s;s
at a public market, drew down to this
country the Engli&s;h dealers; and now the
greater part of our cattle are &s;old at home
for ready money. What rea&s;on have we to
doubt, but that the Engli&s;h dealers will re&s;ort
to our fairs for linen, as they do for cattle?
There is no rea&s;on to doubt, provided we per|form
our part; which is, to be indu&s;trious in
advancing our linens to their perfection. Our
<PB N="28" REF="27">
&s;ituation for &s;uch fairs is undoubtedly better
than that of Ireland: for, &s;uppo&s;ing other ar|ticles
equal, an Engli&s;h dealer, unaccu&s;tom|ed
and aver&s;e to &s;ea-voyages, will never pre|fer
a perilous navigation before a &s;afe and
&s;nug journey upon <HI>terra firma.</HI></P>
<P>The trouble and expence of carrying home
goods that remain un&s;old at a fair, have
&s;ugge&s;ted a linen-hall, as a repo&s;itory for
&s;uch goods, where dealers may be provi|ded
during the interval between two fairs.
But as it is difficult to fore&s;ee the fate of any
new project, the Tru&s;tees, &s;en&s;ible of former
di&s;appointments, will probably be di&s;inclined
to adopt any expen&s;ive plan for a linen-hall.
It is the &s;afe&s;t cour&s;e to be frugal in making
the experiment: &s;ucce&s;s may encourage them
hereafter to be more bold.</P>
<P>One capital view of the plan propo&s;ed,
which can &s;carce fail of &s;ucce&s;s, is, to re&s;cue
the poor weavers from the oppre&s;&s;ion of the
whole&s;ale-dealer, by affording them a choice
of markets. If the price offered by their
neighbour, the whole&s;ale-man, be not thought
&s;ufficient, a number of them clubbing toge|ther
may &s;end their goods to an Edinburgh
fair, under the care of one of them&s;elves, or
of any tru&s;ty per&s;on. This plan will be a
<PB N="29" REF="28">
&s;ignal ble&s;&s;ing to the hawkers in particular:
it will enlarge their field of action: it will
make them independent: and it will augment
their number; than which nothing can be
more beneficial to the manufacturer. Every
web is picked up as it comes from the loom,
with a view to &s;ome little profit at an ap|proaching
fair; and in &s;o &s;wift a circulation,
a very &s;lender profit will content a hawker.
This plan will be equally convenient for ped|lers,
who, in&s;tead of painful journeys through
the country to make up their a&s;&s;ortments,
find at hand in a fair, every &s;ort they have oc|ca&s;ion
for. Nor need we be diffident of com|mi&s;&s;ions
from Gla&s;gow, Liverpool, and other
trading towns on the we&s;t coa&s;t; becau&s;e the
dealers in the&s;e towns will find them&s;elves
cheaper &s;erved here than at London.</P>
<P>The&s;e effects of the plan are obvious at fir&s;t
view. But there appear other good effects,
&s;ome more, &s;ome le&s;s exten&s;ive, that ca&s;t up
upon further con&s;ideration. In the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place,
Frugal per&s;ons, who purcha&s;e for their own u&s;e,
will undoubtedly re&s;ort to the public market,
becau&s;e ready money will afford them both
choice and cheapne&s;s. <HI>2dly,</HI> Buyers and &s;el|lers
coming to be mutually acquainted, the
reputation of the be&s;t arti&s;ts will procure
<PB N="30" REF="29">
them private commi&s;&s;ions for all the linen
they make. <HI>3dly,</HI> The&s;e fairs will be a great
means for improving the fabric of our linens.
At pre&s;ent there is little opportunity for a
comparative trial; but here manufacturers
will &s;oon be made &s;en&s;ible that they have
little chance to vend their goods if the fabric
be in any degree imperfect. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> The quick
circulation of money produced by the&s;e fairs,
will enable the manufacturer to vend his
goods at the lowe&s;t price; and the current
price for ready money being thus fixed, mu&s;t
have the effect to regulate in &s;ome mea&s;ure
the bargains that are made upon time.</P>
<P>Every one who gives attention to what is
pa&s;&s;ing in the world, mu&s;t perceive the im|portance
of the linen manufacture to Scot|land.
Like a &s;tone rolled half-way up-hill,
it mu&s;t be pu&s;hed to the &s;ummit, or it will
fall to the bottom, and involve all in ruin.
Hone&s;t labour and unrelenting indu&s;try will
pu&s;h this manufacture to the &s;ummit, and
produce a moderate degree of opulence, with
its never-failing attendants, plenty and popu|lation.
Opulence &s;o acquired, being di&s;tri|buted
through every vein of the politic body,
&s;erves to animate every member. May Hea|ven
avert from our thoughts the ambition of
<PB N="31" REF="30">
acquiring wealth independent of labour and
indu&s;try; for profu&s;e wealth, being always
unequally di&s;tributed, never fails to &s;ap the
foundations of virtue, to erect a throne for
luxury, and for depraved &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, which
reduce a nation to an abject &s;tate of degene|racy,
and terminate in a total corruption of
manners.</P>
