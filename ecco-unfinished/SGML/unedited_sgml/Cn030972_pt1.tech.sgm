<HEAD>THE
EARL OF DOUGLAS,
AN
ENGLISH STORY.</HEAD>
<P>IN the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VII.
king of <HI>England, George Nevill,</HI>
earl of <HI>Abergavenny,</HI> had the
misfortune to be &s;u&s;pected an
accomplice with <HI>William de la
Pole,</HI> earl of <HI>Suffolk:</HI> he was
&s;eized, and committed to the
Tower, where he remained pri|&s;oner
<PB N="2" REF="4">
&s;ome years; but having
inconte&s;tably proved his inno|cence
was at length &s;et at liber|ty.</P>
<P>THE warmth of re&s;entment
for a di&s;grace he &s;o little de&s;erv|ed,
and the many di&s;agreeable
con&s;equences that attended it, af|fected
him &s;o &s;trongly, that, if
with honour he could have di&s;|engaged
him&s;elf from the duty
he owed his country, he would
gladly have fini&s;hed his days in
<HI>France;</HI> but finding no plau&s;ible
pretext for leaving the kingdom,
he re&s;olved, however, to have
his nephew, <HI>Roger,</HI> earl of <HI>War|wick,</HI>
educated at <HI>Paris.</HI> This
young nobleman was the &s;on of
a brother, lately decea&s;ed, who&s;e
dying reque&s;t recommended him
to his care. A very favourable
opportunity enabled him to exe|cute
<PB N="3" REF="5">
his plan. <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. was
now upon the throne. Mary,
his &s;i&s;ter, was a fini&s;hed beauty.
The king had artfully rejected
&s;everal advantageous propo&s;als of
marriage from the neighbouring
monarchs, by a reluctancy to
part with &s;o bright an ornament
to his court, till the duke of
<HI>Longueville,</HI> who was taken pri|&s;oner
by <HI>Henry,</HI> at the battle of
<HI>Spurs,</HI> endeavoured to negotiate
a match with the Prince&s;s <HI>Mary,</HI>
and his ma&s;ter <HI>Louis</HI> XII. The
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> monarch li&s;tened with
rapture to the propo&s;al, and the
<HI>French</HI> one was &s;o charmed with
the lady's portrait, that he im|mediately
di&s;patched an envoy,
who concluded both a peace and
a marriage within a fortnight,
and conducted the prince&s;s to
<HI>Boulogne.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="6">
THE earl of <HI>Abergavenny</HI>
prevailed with this amba&s;&s;ador to
take his nephew as one of the
prince&s;ses pages, who not being
more than eleven years old, pa&s;|&s;ed
unob&s;erved in her train.</P>
<P>THE king &s;ent the <HI>Count de
Angaule&s;me</HI> to receive the prin|ce&s;s,
and e&s;pou&s;e her by proxy.
This prince, who&s;e per&s;on was
particularly plea&s;ing, executed
his commi&s;&s;ion with &s;o much wit
and gallentry, that the young
queen could not forbear letting
a &s;igh of tender recollection e&s;|cape
her.&mdash;The earl was not in|&s;en&s;ible
to the charms of the
beautiful <HI>Mary;</HI> the flame was
kindled in his heart, which was
only awakened in hers; and po&s;|&s;ibly
he might have indulged this
amorous pur&s;uit &s;till farther, had
it not being checked in its cour&s;e
<PB N="5" REF="7">
by Chancellor <HI>du Pratt;</HI> who
tried to move him on the &s;ide of
intere&s;t and policy; but perceiv|ing
the&s;e were things he regarded
with contempt, and that his
imagination was too much heat|ed
to be guided by rea&s;on, he
ventured to tru&s;t him with the
new queen's attachment to the
duke of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> which at once
cooled his ardour.</P>
<P>THE king waited at <HI>Abbe|ville</HI>
for his royal partner, where
their nuptials were celebrated
with the utmo&s;t magnificence.
Six weeks after their entry into
<HI>Paris, Louis</HI> died in the Palace of
<HI>Toumelles.</HI> The queen decla|ring
her&s;elf not with-child, the
<HI>Count de Angaule&s;me</HI> a&s;cended
the throne, by the title of <HI>Fran|cis</HI>
I. She was permitted to mar|ry
the duke of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> who was
<PB N="6" REF="8">
&s;ent by <HI>Henry</HI> to attend the
queen into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>THE earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> by his
uncle's order, continued at <HI>Paris,</HI>
and was honoured with the &s;ame
po&s;t he had enjoyed in the queen's
hou&s;ehold. He attended at an
interview between the king's of
<HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> who were
indi&s;putably the mo&s;t accompli&s;h|ed
and gallant princes of the age:
their courts were equally bril|liant
and magnificent. Tourna|ments
and runnings at the ring,
in honour of the ladies, drew
from all parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> per|&s;ons
of the fir&s;t fa&s;hion, to be
&s;pectators, or competitors in the&s;e
royal amu&s;ement; and the camp
between <HI>Gue&s;nes,</HI> and <HI>Ardres,</HI>
was called from its &s;plendor, the
<HI>Pavillion of Cloth of Gold.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="9">
AMONG the numerous beau|ties
that graced the circle, the
counte&s;s of <HI>Lorge</HI> had the &s;ati&s;|faction
of ob&s;erving the looks
and admiration of the company
were not divided. Lady <HI>Eliza
Montgomery,</HI> her daughter, bore
the prize of beauty from all her
companions. The earl of <HI>War|wick,</HI>
then turned of fifteen, was
&s;o &s;truck with her incomparable
beauty, he was ready to &s;ink
when his uncle acquainted him
that <HI>Henry</HI> in&s;i&s;ted on his taking
leave of the king of <HI>France,</HI>
with proper acknowledgments of
his kindne&s;s, and returning im|mediately
to <HI>England.</HI> Not in
a &s;ituation to oppo&s;e the com|mand
of <HI>Henry,</HI> or the will of
his uncle, the young earl, not|with&s;tanding
his regret, was o|bliged
to obey, without the con|&s;olation
<PB N="8" REF="10">
of convincing her of the
&s;incerity of his pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>HE embarked in the royal
fleet, impre&s;&s;ed with an idea of
the fair <HI>Eliza,</HI> &s;o full of tender|ne&s;s
and &s;en&s;ibility, as from the
moment of departure bani&s;hed
tranquillity from his brea&s;t.</P>
<P>THE two monarchs &s;eparated
&s;o mutually &s;atisfied with each
other, that nothing was talked of
but the harmony and grandure
of the late congre&s;s. Among&s;t
the noblemen who had been
mo&s;t lavi&s;h in expence on that
occa&s;ion, was the duke of <HI>Buck|ingham</HI>
But Cardinal <HI>Wol&s;ey,</HI>
the king's favorite, having
learnt that, before he left <HI>Lon|don,</HI>
the duke expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome
di&s;like to an expedition &s;o un|nece&s;&s;ary
and expen&s;ive, re&s;olved
<PB N="9" REF="11">
to avail him&s;elf of that circum|&s;tance,
to compa&s;s his ruin;
con&s;idering him as an ob&s;tacle to
his ambitious de&s;igns. Accord|ingly,
no &s;ooner was the king
arrived, than the cardinal ac|cu&s;ed
the duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI>
of high trea&s;on. <HI>Henry</HI> &s;urpri|&s;ed
and irritated, wrote to him
to come in&s;tantly and clear him|&s;elf
of the accu&s;ation:&mdash;he was
put under an arre&s;t the moment
he appeared, with his &s;on-in-law,
the earl of <HI>Abergavenny</HI> and
though a loyal &s;ubject, the car|dinal
gratified his vengeance.
The unfortunate duke lo&s;t his
head upon a &s;caffold; and Lord
<HI>Abergavenny</HI> was not relea&s;ed of
&s;ome months, with the entire
forfeiture of his e&s;tate.</P>
<P>MISFORTUNES, &s;o heavy, in|duced
him to &s;end the earl of
<PB N="10" REF="12">
<HI>Warwick</HI> back to <HI>France,</HI> dread
le&s;t the king's &s;everity of tem|per,
or rather the blind &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion
he paid to <HI>Wol&s;ey's</HI> opi|nion,
&s;hould plunge his family
in fre&s;h calamities, tempted him
to take the liberty of addre&s;&s;ing
<HI>Francis</HI> I. to &s;helter his nephew
again under his protection. That
monarch graciou&s;ly con&s;ented,
and the earl, con&s;tant to the
remembrance of Lady <HI>Eliza
Montgomery,</HI> was tran&s;ported
with joy, to &s;ee her at court in
the rank of one of the queen's
maids of honour. His &s;ole &s;tu|dy
was to gain her affection;
he devoted him&s;elf entirely to
her &s;ervice; and his per&s;everance
flattered him, very ju&s;tly, with
the hope of a tender return from
his amiable fair one.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="13">
WOLSEY was &s;etting all his
political engines at work to en|able
him to wreak his fury on the
Emperor <HI>Maximilian.</HI>&mdash;He
wi&s;hed to mortify the emperor
by engaging his ma&s;ter in a treaty
of marriage with <HI>Marguerite,</HI> one
of the madames of <HI>France.</HI> But
love was indu&s;trious in de&s;troy|ing
that machination. <HI>Henry</HI>
became pa&s;&s;ionately enamoured
of <HI>Anne Boleyne,</HI> daughter to
Sir <HI>Thomas Boleyne.</HI> appointed
maid of honour to the Prince&s;s
<HI>Mary,</HI> on her marriage with
<HI>Louis,</HI> and who was now return|ed
to her native country: the
&s;ingular elegance of her per&s;on,
animated with a brilliant turn of
wit, enchanted the &s;u&s;ceptible
monarch to &s;uch a degree, that
he fancied he could not exi&s;t with|out
her&mdash;that all his happine&s;s
was centred in her &s;miles.&mdash;The
<PB N="12" REF="14">
re&s;i&s;tance with which &s;he repul&s;|ed
his amorous &s;olicitations, de|termined
him to take her to his
throne: he omitted nothing to
prevail with the pope to di&s;&s;olve
his marriage with Queen <HI>Cathe|rine;</HI>
and the firmne&s;s of the
pontiff in refu&s;ing his con&s;ent to
this unju&s;t action, inflamed him
&s;o violently, that it became the
final cau&s;e of the reformation.</P>
<P>HENRY went to <HI>Boulogne,</HI>
where the royal family of <HI>France</HI>
met him, and repeated a&s;&s;urances
pa&s;&s;ed of reciprocal friend&s;hip.
The true motive of the king of
<HI>England's</HI> voyage was to com|plain
of the pope's inflexibility,
and to engage <HI>Francis</HI> to &s;olicit
his holine&s;s to &s;ummons a coun|cil
for the pro&s;ecution of his di|vorce.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="15">
THE earl of <HI>Warwick's</HI> &s;oli|citude
and attachment to the fair
<HI>Montgomery,</HI> had &s;o &s;trongly
convinced her of his merit and
affection, that &s;he agreed to his
addre&s;&s;ing the king and queen
for their con&s;ent. This lady,
&s;ince her mother's death, de|pended
entirely upon her maje&s;|ty;
the earl was no longer un|der
the guardian&s;hip of his re|lations,
and the alliance he
&s;ought was &s;o honourable, that
it met with general approbation.
He obtained with facility from
his royal benefactre&s;s a gift, in
his e&s;timation, preferable to the
univer&s;e it&s;elf! Their nuptials
were celebrated at <HI>Calais,</HI> and
nothing could exceed the diver|&s;ions
and &s;plendour that accom|panied
them: the two kings ri|valled
each other in conferring
honours and pre&s;ents on the no|ble
<PB N="14" REF="16">
pair, and they attended <HI>Hen|ry</HI>
into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>THE king's pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Anne
Boleyne,</HI> augmented in propor|tion
to the ob&s;tacles he had to
encounter. He married her,
and they were directly crowned
at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter;</HI> but when the
pope's bull was fulminated from
<HI>Rome,</HI> he grew frantic!&mdash;He
declared him&s;elf <HI>&s;upreme head of
the church,</HI> and became the per|&s;ecutor
of tho&s;e who&s;e doctrines
he had defended. Every day
was u&s;hered in with the execu|tion
of per&s;ons of all ranks and
&s;exes, in the cau&s;e of religion;
and his wrath extended to the
profanation of relicks, burning
tho&s;e of <HI>Becket</HI> at <HI>Canterbury.</HI>
The earl of <HI>Exeter,</HI> brother to
Cardinal <HI>Pole,</HI> and <HI>Edward Ne|vil,</HI>
Lord <HI>Courtenay,</HI> animated
<PB N="15" REF="17">
with zeal and indignation, ven|tured
to remon&s;trate to his ma|je&s;ty
on the &s;everity of his con|duct.
Their heads paid the price
of their temerity; and as the
earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> was of near kin|dred
to Lord <HI>Courtenay,</HI> he was
accu&s;ed of di&s;re&s;pectful murmur|ings;
which, however fal&s;e,
made it nece&s;&s;ary to leave the
kingdom with expedition, to a|void
an ignominious death.&mdash;
Tho&s;e branches of his family,
who were more anxious about
their lives and e&s;tates, than their
con&s;ciences and honours, con|formed
with &s;ervile &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion,
to the will of the &s;overeign.&mdash;
They embraced his religion,
and through policy, avowed
them&s;elves the bittere&s;t enemies
to the earl of <HI>Warwick.</HI> His
e&s;tate was confi&s;cated&mdash;but
what touched him more than
all his afflictions, was the
<PB N="16" REF="18">
nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;eparation from
one of the mo&s;t charming and
virtuous women in the world.
With her he left an only daugh|ter,
named <HI>Julia,</HI> of two years
old: and, recommending in the
tendere&s;t terms this precious
pledge of their union to her care,
he informed her of his re&s;olution
to go to <HI>Venice,</HI> then at war with
the <HI>Turks;</HI> that the <HI>Pope,</HI> the
<HI>Emperor,</HI> and the <HI>Doge,</HI> had ju&s;t
concluded a treaty again&s;t <HI>Soly|man</HI>&mdash;
That now was the time
to acquire fame, or find a glori|ous
death!</P>
<P>THE counte&s;s, drowned in
tears, could &s;carcely &s;upport her
&s;pirits at this melancholy part|ing,
from a hu&s;band &s;o infinitely
dear! yet &s;he would not exert
her influence to detain him, ter|rified
as &s;he was, with the dan|ger
<PB N="17" REF="19">
he was expo&s;ed to in &s;taying
longer; and convinced that he
could hope for no advantages in a
country where his religion was
an in&s;urmountable bar to prefer|ment:
&s;he was &s;en&s;ible the earl
was now at a time of life when
a man of &s;pirit reproaches him|&s;elf
for inactivity and ea&s;e; and
her virtue and fortitude, taught
her to approve what her love la|mented.</P>
<P>A FAVOURABLE wind &s;oon
wafted him to <HI>Venice;</HI> he was
received by the Admiral <HI>Capello,</HI>
with evident te&s;timonies of e&s;|teem,
wakened by a former ac|quaintance
with the hou&s;e of
<HI>Warwick:</HI> he went with him to
<HI>Corfou,</HI> where they joined the
&s;quadrons of the pope and the
emperor: a council of war was
held, when it was debated whe|ther
<PB N="18" REF="20">
they were &s;trong enough to
bear down upon the enemy im|mediately?
It was carried in
the affirmative. The <HI>Turks</HI> were
&s;urprized at the impetuo&s;ity of
the confederates, and undeter|mined
whether to engage or not?
When the intrepid <HI>Barbaro&s;&s;a</HI> re|&s;olved
to repair by &s;ome memo|rable
action the di&s;grace he had
&s;u&s;tained in his former retreat
from <HI>Corfou.</HI></P>
<P>CAPELLO commanded the fir&s;t
divi&s;ion, and the enemy was no
&s;ooner in &s;ight, than, in&s;pired
with a noble emulation, he
crowded all his &s;ail to attack
them: he repeated his fire &s;o &s;uc|ce&s;sfully,
they were compelled
to retire. Prince <HI>Doria,</HI> perceiv|ing
the advantage gained by the
<HI>Venetian</HI> admiral, advanced with
his &s;quadron, apparently to &s;e|cond
<PB N="19" REF="21">
the attack; but without
any di&s;coverable rea&s;on, tacked
about, and retreated to <HI>Cape
Cal.</HI></P>
<P>THIS di&s;appointent was very
&s;en&s;ibly felt by the allies, who
broke into loud complaints,
and the <HI>Turks</HI> ob&s;erving them
&s;lacken their &s;ails, on a &s;udden,
came out of the Gulf, and formed
a line of battle; but the irre&s;o|lution
and doubts of the confede|rates,
prevented an engagement,
&s;o that <HI>Barbaro&s;&s;a,</HI> and the fa|mous
Cor&s;air <HI>Dragut Rais,</HI> had
time to gain the &s;hore, whil&s;t the
allies reflected with a&s;toni&s;hment
on the glorious opportunity they
had lo&s;t: <HI>C$pello,</HI> and the Patri|arch
<HI>Grimani,</HI> blu&s;hing with
&s;hame and anger, got on board a
light frigate, and went in pur|&s;uit
of <HI>Doria,</HI> whom they in|treated
<PB N="20" REF="22">
to join in taking the ad|vantages
fortune offered to their
acceptance. Let us go my lord,
&s;aid the <HI>Venetian</HI> admiral, let
us go where glory calls us; let
us attack our half-vanqui&s;hed
enemies, who demon&s;trate their
fear by their flight.&mdash;I wait
but for your orders.&mdash;The cry
was now to engage. <HI>Doria</HI> a|&s;hamed
of being the only per&s;on
who retarded their eagerne&s;s,
gave orders to begin the fight,
and a &s;econd time retreated, in
the moment when all things
&s;eemed to promi&s;e &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>DRAGUT RAIS, &s;eeing two
<HI>Venetian</HI> galleys in the rear of the
fleet, at &s;ome di&s;tance, endea|voured
to board them: the earl
of <HI>Warwick,</HI> unfortunately for
him, was in one of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els.
The re&s;i&s;tance he made was the
<PB N="21" REF="23">
admiration of both parties.&mdash;
Nature, exhau&s;ted by extraordi|nary
efforts of courage, at length
&s;unk under &s;uperior numbers.
Some &s;oldiers, who &s;wam on
&s;hore, carried with them the
news of his death The com|manders
and officers who had
been witne&s;&s;es to his gallantry,
were exceedingly afflicted; and
as fame redoubles her bla&s;t for
the conveyance of bad news,
and the counte&s;s of <HI>Warwick's</HI>
anxiety indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;ought eve|ry
opportunity of information,
&s;he was too &s;oon acquainted with
her irreparable lo&s;s. This ten|der
wife, unable to re&s;i&s;t the
&s;torm of grief, that a&s;&s;aulted her
in its mo&s;t dreadful fury, was
&s;en&s;ible her la&s;t hour was ap|proaching;
and having no far|ther
attachment to the world,
after being deprived of what was
<PB N="22" REF="24">
dearer to her than life, felt no
regret but in the thought of leav|ing
her lovely infant, who in its
early dawn gave the promi&s;e of
exqui&s;ite beauty. The afflicted
mother caught her in her arms,
tears trickling down the lillies of
her cheeks, O, my dear <HI>Julia!</HI>
my &s;weet innocent! what will
become of thee! &s;aid the dying
fair one, where wilt thou find a
father's care? where a mother's
fondne&s;s! Alas! thy fath$r is
no more!&mdash;and thy mother is
thine but a few hours! I leave
thee at an age when thou &s;tande&s;t
mo&s;t in need of maternal affec|tion&mdash;but
I tru&s;t that providence
will take care to guard thee from
dangers to which I leave thee ex|po&s;ed.
&mdash;To the &s;upreme pro|tector
of all things I commit
thee. Saying this, &s;he rai&s;ed
her eyes towards <HI>Heaven,</HI> be|&s;eeching
<PB N="23" REF="25">
its protection on the
&s;miling infant.</P>
<P>IN this agony of di&s;tre&s;s, the
earl and counte&s;s of <HI>Douglas</HI>
came to vi&s;it her, in her retire|ment,
which &s;he had never quit|ted
&s;ince her lord's departure.
They were per&s;ons of uncom|mon
merit, and had always been
regarded as their be&s;t friends;
there was even &s;ome affinity be|tween
the hou&s;es of <HI>Douglas</HI> and
<HI>Montgomery,</HI> the former the mo&s;t
illu&s;trious family in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
but particular &s;ubjects of di&s;con|tent
occa&s;ioned the earl of <HI>Doug|las</HI>
to &s;ettle in <HI>England,</HI> when
he married a daughter of the earl
of <HI>Bedford's,</HI> a woman of worth
and under&s;tanding; they were
both in very good favour with
the king.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="26">
THIS interview was di&s;tre&s;s|ful
beyond conception. Their
&s;ighs and tears a long time denied
them the power of &s;peech, and
when they beheld the &s;ituation
of the counte&s;s, their &s;orrow
had no bounds.</P>
<P>AT length, exerting his ut|mo&s;t
fortitude, the earl &s;aid all
he thought capable of &s;oothing

<P>THE earl of <HI>Douglas</HI> &s;aid every
thing that could be expected
<PB N="27" REF="29">
from a man of refined genero&s;ity,
a tender relation, or a &s;incere

replied Lady <HI>Warwick,</HI> how is
it po&s;&s;ible to an&s;wer &s;uch ama|zing

my dear infant the kindne&s;s you

in your hands, madam,
what jewels I have, that they
may &s;upply her nece&s;&s;ities when|ever
&s;he may want them; do me
the ju&s;tice to believe, that by
this legacy I do not mean to di&s;|tru&s;t
your genero&s;ity, I am per|&s;uaded,
in that particular, as well
as in the expence of her educa|tion,
<PB N="28" REF="30">
you will omit nothing &s;ui|table
to her birth; but &s;ince I
have them, it would be inju&s;tice
to deprive her of what properly
appertains to her. In fini&s;hing
the&s;e words, &s;he pre&s;ented a &s;mall
ca&s;ket that &s;tood by the bed-&s;ide,
which contained jewels to the
value of &s;ix thou&s;and pounds:
there is all that is left of a no|ble

deficient in &s;pirit and &s;entiment;
but as virtue is the mo&s;t &s;olid

&s;carcely po&s;&s;ible under your ho&s;|pitable

when &s;he is of age to be tru&s;ted

<P>THE noble pair were &s;o &s;unk
in grief, that they wept with|out
being able to an&s;wer her, or
to re&s;olve to leave her; but be|fore
they could recollect how to
act, the dying mother, who&s;o
pre&s;ence of mind was always un|common,
expre&s;&s;ed her unea&s;i|ne&s;s
in what manner they could
convey her daughter without
being perceived by &s;ome or other
of the dome&s;ticks, which would
be hazarding their acquainting
her uncles where &s;he was: af|ter
a few moments reflection,
&s;he determined to tru&s;t her con|fe&s;&s;or,
a man upon who&s;e &s;ecre|cy
&s;he could depend, and with
his concurrence, the nur&s;e, who
was a good catholick, might
<PB N="31" REF="33">
&s;pread a report that &s;he died of
convul&s;ions.</P>
<P>AFTER the&s;e mea&s;ures were
&s;ettled, they comforted Lady
<HI>Warwick</HI> with the mo&s;t cordial
promi&s;es of care and tenderne&s;s
to the lovely orphan. They were
obliged to be cautious in enqui|ries
after they left her, le&s;t their
&s;olicitude &s;hould awaken &s;u&s;pi|cion
in the minds of her relations.
In about five days they received
intelligence from the confe&s;&s;or of
her death, and the place where
the child was &s;ecreted. The
counte&s;s of <HI>Douglas</HI> brought it
from thence, and what enabled
her perfectly to conceal the my&s;|tery,
was the death of an infant
daughter of the &s;ame age that
had been nur&s;ed in the ccuntry.
When the little <HI>Julia</HI> was intro|duced
into her mama's appart|ment,
<PB N="32" REF="34">
for &s;o we mu&s;t now call
the counte&s;s of <HI>Douglas,</HI> her &s;on,
<HI>Hyppolytus</HI> was pre&s;ent, then &s;e|ven
years old, and remarkably
hand&s;ome and &s;en&s;ible. He ap|peared
delighted with his new
&s;i&s;ter; and <HI>Lucilla,</HI> who was a|bout
four, was not half &s;o great
a favourite: this partiality en|crea&s;ed
daily; he was never ea&s;y
out of her &s;ight. The emotions
of the heart are very apparent
during infancy, when the lan|guage
of nature is only heard&mdash;
it &s;poke in a thou&s;and little a&s;&s;i|duities
towards <HI>Julia,</HI> who at
twelve years old promi&s;ed a com|pleat
model of perfection in
mind and per&s;on, that attracted
general admiration; her figure
was tall and genteel; her air ma|je&s;tic,
yet &s;oftened with mode&s;|ty
and &s;weetne&s;s. The lu&s;tre of
her fine black eyes dazzled the
<PB N="33" REF="35">
beholders. The &s;miling graces
played round the ro&s;es of her
lips, and lilly whitene&s;s of her
teeth and complection, the latter
tinged with the animated blu&s;h
of Guido's Aurora! Her fair hair
flowed in a profu&s;ion of natural
ringl$ts, &s;etting off the delicacy
of her beauty. The fine turn of
her neck and feet, even exceed|ed
that elegance peculiar to the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> ladies. Her movement
in walking and dancing, was in|imitable.
Her voice was har|mony
it&s;elf, enchanting the
li&s;tening ear. The manly beauty
of <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> was equally wor|thy
of regard. His &s;hape, his
features, his intelligent counte|nance;
a noble frankne&s;s, con|nected
with manners polite
and complacent, an under&s;tand|ing
enlarged and improved;
&mdash;all the&s;e were &s;o con&s;picu|ous,
<PB N="34" REF="36">
that to &s;ee him was to ho|nour!
to e&s;teem! to love. <HI>Lu|cilla</HI>
had a great deal of wit and
chearfulne&s;s, and where <HI>Julia</HI>
was not pre&s;ent, would have
been allowed &s;uperior in charms
to mo&s;t of her &s;ex.</P>
<P>THESE three young per&s;ons
lived in the &s;tricte&s;t friend&s;hip,
till at length <HI>Hyppolytus</HI> began to
lo&s;e his vivacity, and <HI>Julia</HI> to
fall into deep mu&s;ing. They
could not bear the &s;horte&s;t &s;epa|ration,
and would fly in &s;earch
of each other, but when found,
they would only &s;uppre&s;s a &s;igh,
and be at a lo&s;s for words.</P>
<P>They would look whole hours
in &s;ilent langui&s;hment, and &s;eem|ed
lo&s;t in this innocent plea&s;ure;
&mdash;when a &s;udden recollection
would mount the blood into their
cheeks. They would fix their
<PB N="35" REF="37">
eyes on the ground in profound
meditation.</P>
<P>YET the days appeared too
&s;hort to &s;atisfy their impatience
of &s;eeing and conver&s;ing with
each other; and ab&s;ence always
made them &s;en&s;ible their whole
happine&s;s was centred in the
plea&s;ure of meeting again. <HI>Lu|cilla's</HI>
playful di&s;po&s;ition often
tempted her to rally them. Bro|ther,
&s;aid &s;he, to <HI>Hyppolytus,</HI>
you love my &s;i&s;ter better than
you do me; as her elder, I have
a right to be jealous;&mdash;but I
will hone&s;tly confe&s;s that I can't
complain of the ju&s;tice of your
preference, for tho' I love you
very much, I verily believe &s;he
loves you &s;till more! Don't be|lieve
her, <HI>Hyppolytus,</HI> &s;aid the
blu&s;hing <HI>Julia,</HI> we have both of
us an equal regard for you! And
<PB N="36" REF="38">
why, my dear &s;i&s;ter, will you
damp the joy I have, in hearing
that you love me? <HI>Julia</HI> was
too much embarra&s;&s;ed to reply,
and fell into her u&s;ual thought|fulne&s;s;
whil&s;t <HI>Hyppolytus</HI> was
&s;ilent from grief and chagrine;
and <HI>Lucilla,</HI> who looked at both
with a&s;toni&s;hment, was at a lo&s;s
to form any conjecture of the
cau&s;e.</P>
<P>IT happened one day, when
the earl and counte&s;s were at a
fine hou&s;e of their's at <HI>Bucking|ham,
Julia</HI> was walking with
her brother and &s;i&s;ter by the &s;ide
of a lake, &s;he had an inclination
to row to a little i&s;land in the
centre, to look at a &s;wans ne&s;t:
no &s;ooner had &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her
de&s;ire, <HI>Hyppolytus</HI> run with ea|gerne&s;s
to unloo&s;e a &s;mall boat
tyed to the foot of a tree, and
<PB N="37" REF="39">
rowing it towards his &s;i&s;ters,
took them in. But not knowing
how to manage the oars, they
were &s;oon entangled among&s;t
the ru&s;hes; the ladies were
frightened at finding the boat
lean too much on one &s;ide,
and, in hopes of poi&s;ing it, threw
them&s;elves &s;o &s;uddenly on the o|ther,
that it over&s;et; and they
were in imminent danger of
being drowned. Had <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
been alone, he could ea&s;ily have
&s;aved him&s;elf, but in &s;uch &s;itu|ations
the effort to a&s;&s;i&s;t the per|&s;on
we love, bani&s;hes all &s;elfi&s;h
con&s;iderations.&mdash;He thought of
nothing but his dear <HI>Julia,</HI> and
tenderne&s;s &s;upplying him with
fre&s;h &s;trength and &s;kill in &s;wim|ming,
he caught hold of her
cloaths, and drew her &s;afe to the
little i&s;land, which was not very
di&s;tant: but there is no de&s;cri|bing
the exce&s;s of his grief when
<PB N="38" REF="40">
he &s;aw her eyes clo&s;ed, and her
face covered with a mortal pale|ne&s;s:
&mdash;&s;he was motionle&s;s, and
as we are apt to believe, what
we mo&s;t dread, he did not doubt
her being gone for ever:&mdash;Ah
wretch that I am! &s;aid he, my
un&s;kilfulne&s;s has cau&s;ed her death!
&s;he was breathle&s;s before I could
draw her from the water! <HI>Julia,</HI>
my dear <HI>Julia!</HI> what will be
my fate! Saying this, he caught
her in his arms in all the ago|nies
of woe, and laying his cheek
to her's, his loud exclamations,
and &s;treaming tears, &s;oon reco|vered
her from a &s;woon that fear
alone had occa&s;ioned.</P>
<P>OPENING her lovely eyes, and
fixing them upon tho&s;e of <HI>Hyp|politus,</HI>
who in this moment felt
his own life renewed. You &s;eem
deeply affected, my dear brother,
&s;aid &s;he, can you think me wor|thy
<PB N="39" REF="41">
of being regretted by you?
Or ought I my&s;elf to regret leav|ing
life? Ah, my deare&s;t &s;i&s;ter,
&s;aid he, embracing her, I beg
you not to recall to my remem|brance
that we mu&s;t ever part.
&mdash;If you knew the exqui&s;ite
torture I have &s;uffered from this
apprehen&s;ion, you would pity
me! Before <HI>Julia</HI> could reply,
they &s;aw a boat, which the earl
of <HI>Douglas</HI> had &s;ent to bring
them over the lake; for by a
peculiar providence in favour of
<HI>Lucilla,</HI> his lord&s;hip pa&s;&s;ed by at
the very moment the boat over|&s;et,
and his attendants jumpt in|to
the water to &s;ave her, other|wi&s;e
&s;he mu&s;t inevitably have pe|ri&s;hed;
for notwith&s;tanding the
real tenderne&s;s of her brother,
his &s;oul had been &s;o engro&s;&s;ed by
<HI>Julia's</HI> danger, he never once
thought of his &s;i&s;ter's!</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="42">
On their landing, the earl and
counte&s;s reprimanded them with
&s;ome warmth on running &s;uch
hazards, and as <HI>Lucilla's</HI> &s;en&s;i|bility
was alarmed by her bro|ther's
indifference on this occa|&s;ion,
&s;he could not forbear ex|pre&s;&s;ing
a little re&s;entment.&mdash;
&startq;Indeed, &s;aid &s;he, I had all the
danger to my&s;elf&mdash;When my
&s;i&s;ter is in company, &s;he may de|pend
on my brother's care of
her, but as for me, I don't know
who I have to depend upon!&endq;&mdash;
This reproach di&s;concerted them
bo$h extremely; and at the &s;ame
time explained to Lord and Lady
<HI>Douglas,</HI> what inattention had
hitherto prevented them from
ob&s;erving. They looked at each
other in a manner expre&s;&s;ive of
&s;urprize and vexation. They
had long di&s;po&s;ed of <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
in their own imagination, to the
<PB N="41" REF="43">
only daughter of the earl of <HI>Ar|gyle;</HI>
a rich heire&s;s, and his near
relation. The earl purpo&s;ed
&s;ending <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI>
to wait upon the lady and win
her affection. There was al&s;o a
&s;cheme to marry <HI>Julia</HI> to the earl
of <HI>Bedford,</HI> of the &s;ame family
with the counte&s;s, who had ex|pre&s;&s;ed
a very particular regard
for that young beauty.</P>
<P>THEY were no &s;ooner alone
than they eagerly &s;tarted their
doubts&mdash;Good God! can it be
po&s;&s;ible, that <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> enter|tains
&s;entiments for <HI>Julia</HI> differ|ent
from tho&s;e of fraternal af|fection.
They recollected a thou|&s;and
circum&s;tances that &s;eemed
to reveal it&mdash;and it was re&s;olved
between them, the counte&s;s
&s;hould take the fir&s;t opportunity
of talking with <HI>Julia,</HI> without
<PB N="42" REF="44">
the appearance of premeditation.
&mdash;One morning &s;he went into
her daughter's appartments and
found <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> kneeling by
<HI>Julia's</HI> bed-&s;ide, who was &s;till
&s;leeping. &startq;You are grown a
a remarkably early ri&s;er Sir, &s;aid
the counte&s;s, in a &s;evere tone,
but you might employ your hours
much more advantageou&s;ly at
your &s;tudies, than in coming per|petually
into your &s;i&s;ter's cham|ber!
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> retired very
&s;orrowfully; and the counte&s;s
addre&s;&s;ing her daughters, told
them, that though they ought
to have the tendere&s;t regard for
their brother, and as far as her
authority extended, &s;he com|manded
them to have it, yet &s;he
did not think it con&s;i&s;tent with
propriety and decorum, now they
were above the &s;tate of infancy,
to &s;uffer too great familiarity.
<PB N="43" REF="45">
That &s;he always wi&s;hed to cul|tivate
the &s;tricte&s;t friend&s;hip a|mong&s;t
her children, but that
the difference of &s;ex required a
delicate degree of circum&s;pection.
<HI>Lucilla</HI> declared her implicit o|bedience.
<HI>&mdash;Julia</HI> looked upon
the ground and blu&s;hed: the
counte&s;s's reprimand augmented
her melancholy, which, how|ever
great her &s;olicitude to con|ceal,
was but too apparent.</P>
<P>SHE &s;pent part of every day
in her clo&s;et, and &s;itting one e|vening
at the window, &s;aw the
earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> coming up the
avenue, that led to the hou&s;e.
She had always thought his con|ver&s;ation
di&s;agreeable, but her
pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition made her un|able
to &s;upport the thoughts of it:
&s;he hurried into the garden to a|void
him;&mdash;and that being very
<PB N="44" REF="46">
exten&s;ive, ran through the walks
to gain a little wood at the bot|tom;
and &s;till fearing the &s;er|vants
might be &s;ent in &s;earch of
her, &s;he entered a grotto, not le&s;s
agreeable for its coolne&s;s, than
from the wild rock-work with
which it was ornamented, and
the elegant &s;tatues artfully di&s;|po&s;ed
in niches at proper inter|vals;
&mdash;a noble &s;heet of water
at one end, con&s;tantly &s;parkled
among&s;t the pebbles below, and
pre&s;erved the fre&s;nne&s;s of the
mo&s;s that bordered the fountain.
Oppo&s;ite was an alcove, covered
with woodbines, who&s;e &s;weet|ne&s;s
and &s;hade were adapted to
the ta&s;te of the pen&s;ive <HI>Julia;</HI>
&s;he here abandoned her&s;elf to the
mo&s;t gloomy reflections; when
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> induced by pretty near
the &s;ame motives, came to &s;eek
in the &s;ame place, and a&s;ylum
<PB N="45" REF="47">
from the fatigue of entertaining
a large party of company who
were come to vi&s;it the earl.</P>
<P>HE threw him&s;elf on the ground
without &s;eeing <HI>Julia,</HI> leaning his
head again&s;t part of the rock&mdash;
and remained for &s;ome time
plunged in unutterable &s;orrow.
&mdash;At length, breaking out at

brother! that &s;tar you com|plain

to me!&mdash;in being &s;en&s;ible of
your own misfortune, be &s;en&s;ible

&mdash;I love too well for a &s;i&s;ter!&mdash;I
confe&s;s it&mdash;and hope to merit
part of your pity, by giving you
all mine;&mdash;and by re&s;olving
never to &s;ee you more?&mdash;Yes,
my brother, I will retire to a
convent and conceal my &s;hame
and mi&s;ery from the world&mdash;I
would have even concealed it
from you, but where was the
po&s;&s;ibility, in the &s;ituation I &s;ur|prized
you, of refu&s;ing this la&s;t
con&s;olation? <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> was &s;o
enraptured with the &s;ound of his
dear <HI>Julia's</HI> voice, that he had
<PB N="48" REF="50">
lo&s;t his own. He continued in
&s;ilence at her feet, his eyes ri|vetted
on her's.&mdash;In &s;pite of ti|midity,
he at length faltered out
the&s;e words,&mdash;I will not op|po&s;e
a re&s;olution &s;o generous;
whatever pain I &s;uffer in loving
you for ever&mdash;in &s;eeing you im|mured
within the walls of a
cloi&s;ter;&mdash;my heart will find a
degree of comfort in thinking
you will not be the wife of the
earl of <HI>Bedford.</HI>&mdash;Ah! interrupt|ed
<HI>Julia,</HI> is he the only excep|tion
you would wi&s;h to make?
Alas! my &s;i&s;ter, rejoyned <HI>Hyp|politus,</HI>
do not oblige me to ex|plain
my&s;elf further&mdash;but be a&s;|&s;ured,
on my &s;ide, that I will ne|ver
change my manner of life&mdash;
which, from the moment our
&s;eparation commences, will be
&s;o deplorably mi&s;erable, as not
to be of long duration. <HI>Julia</HI>
<PB N="49" REF="51">
could only an&s;wer by heavy
&s;ighs&mdash;they both melted into
tears.&mdash;Brother &s;aid &s;he, gazing
tenderly upon him, it is over,
we mu&s;t meet no more.&mdash;Alas!
my dear <HI>Julia,</HI> it is a plea&s;ure I dare
not, mu&s;t not wi&s;h!&mdash;Let us &s;trive
to conceal our unfortunate attach|ment
from the world, re&s;umed
&s;he, and if po&s;&s;ible, from our|&s;elves!
&mdash;Saying this &s;he aro&s;e,
and went out of the grotto, with|out
looking at <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> who
beheld her depart without daring
to detain her.</P>
<P>HER depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits would
not allow her to enter the draw|ing-room
till very late, knowing
&s;he &s;hould find the earl of <HI>Bed|ford</HI>
there; and it was to her an
addition of mi&s;ery to li&s;ten to a
declared lover, for whom &s;he had
the mo&s;t perfect indifference;
<PB N="50" REF="52">
&s;he carefully avoided any parti|cular
conver&s;ation, and he re|turned
to <HI>London</HI> the &s;ame even|ing.
<HI>&mdash;Julia</HI> pa&s;&s;ed the night in
the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s;&mdash;her amaze|ment
was beyond expre&s;&s;ion,
when &s;he reflected on her bro|ther's
&s;entiments, and her own.
Good <HI>God!</HI> &s;aid &s;he, weeping
b&igrave;tterly, what have we done to
de&s;erve, young as we are, &s;o ri|gorous
a puni&s;hment? She ro&s;e
very early, without once clo&s;ing
her eyes, dre&s;t her&s;elf with &s;peed,
and knowing Lady <HI>Douglas</HI> was
in her clo&s;et, went in trembling,
and threw her&s;elf on her knees.
&mdash;This action &s;urprized her:&mdash;
Well, <HI>Julia,</HI> &s;aid the counte&s;s,
tenderly, what occa&s;ions this &s;up|plicating
po&s;ture?&mdash;Madam,
the de&s;ire of obtaining a favour,
which I venture to intreat you
will not refu&s;e: I am now in
<PB N="51" REF="53">
my &s;ixteenth year,&mdash;I am your
younge&s;t daughter, and can ex|pect
no great fortune;&mdash;I don't
feel the lea&s;t inclination for being
&s;ettled in the world, but have a
very &s;trong one for a religious
life; &s;o, my dear madam, if the
wi&s;h I have to go to <HI>France</HI> is
not di&s;plea&s;ing to you, I beg you
will con&s;ent, and that you will
per&s;wade my father; and then
either he or you will place me
in a convent. My child, &s;aid
the counte&s;s, a good deal affect|ed,
have you &s;en&s;ibly con&s;idered
the con&s;equences of this reque&s;t?
It would be a &s;ad affair if you
&s;hould deceive your&s;elf by mi&s;|taken
appearances.&mdash;You are
yet &s;o young, that you ought to
take more time in a matter of
&s;uch importance.<HI>&mdash;Julia</HI> re|peated
with amazing fortitude,
that &s;he had weighed every thing
<PB N="52" REF="54">
very maturely, and was tho|roughly
convinced &s;he &s;hould ne|ver
repent. Lady <HI>Douglas</HI> pro|mi&s;ed
to u&s;e her influence with
her lord, to engage his approba|tion.</P>
<P>SHE did not delay a moment
to acquaint him with <HI>Julia's</HI> pe|tition;
I accu&s;e my&s;elf for be|lieving
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> and <HI>Julia</HI> are
in love with each other. The
poor child is far gone in another
pa&s;&s;ion;&mdash;&s;he has a mind to be
a nun! and I come to con|&s;ult
with you, my lord, how we
are to act on this occa&s;ion? &s;he
reque&s;ts, that one of us would
fix her in a convent in <HI>France.&mdash;</HI>
I don't &s;ee, &s;aid the earl, we have
any right to refu&s;e her this &s;a|tisfaction!
but if &s;he continues to
de&s;ire it, you madam, are the
mo&s;t proper per&s;on to accompany
<PB N="53" REF="55">
her. But one &s;tep is nece&s;&s;ary
before all others, and that is, to
inform her who &s;he is, as the
counte&s;s of <HI>Warwick</HI> recom|mended
to us; and the confe&s;&s;or
whom &s;he entru&s;ted with deliver|ing
her into your hands, is yet
alive, to atte&s;t it. Lady <HI>Doug|las</HI>
very much approved the
thought, and reflecting on the
unea&s;y &s;ituation in which &s;he
had left <HI>Julia,</HI> immediately
&s;ent for her. My dear child,
&s;aid &s;he, your father and I have
no other views than to render
you happy&mdash;he con&s;ents to what
you think will make you &s;o;
and has appointed me to conduct
you to <HI>France;</HI> though with a
&s;en&s;ible concern to us both, that
we mu&s;t be &s;eparated. <HI>Julia</HI>
expre&s;&s;ed her gratitude in the mo&s;t
affectionate terms, and after re|turning
<PB N="54" REF="56">
her mo&s;t humble thanks
to the counte&s;s, withdrew.</P>
<P>ON returning to her chamber,
&s;he was told by <HI>Lucilla</HI> that <HI>Hyp|politus</HI>
wanted to &s;peak to her in
his dre&s;&s;ing-room. He is &s;o al|tered
added &s;he, that I am very
much concerned to &s;ee him.&mdash;
My dear &s;i&s;ter you are his con|fident,
&mdash;pray omit nothing to
con&s;ole him, for he &s;eems to me
in deep affliction! <HI>Julia,</HI> ex|tremely
affected with the &s;cene
that had pa&s;&s;ed with her mother,
and &s;till more with what &s;he heard
from <HI>Lucilla,</HI> ha&s;tened to the
dre&s;&s;ing-room, where &s;he found
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> on a &s;opha, his face
covered with a handkerchief; at
her appearance he endeavoured
to ri&s;e, but his &s;trength failed,
and he fell back on the &s;opha,&mdash;
<HI>Julia</HI> advanced, and taking one
<PB N="55" REF="57">
of his hands, which &s;he cla&s;ped
in her's, looked at him for &s;ome
time with eyes &s;wimming in
tears. Brother, &s;aid &s;he, when
able to &s;peak, the &s;ituation I &s;ee
you in, penetrates my heart,&mdash;I
am already &s;ufficiently wretched,
without your adding new afflic|tions
to tho&s;e I &s;uffer. Alas!
how changed is your counte|nance!
you are dying of grief,
whil&s;t I wi&s;h you to live.&mdash;I in|treat
you in the name of.&mdash;
Ah! my dear &s;i&s;ter, interrupted
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> do not exert the em|pire
you have over me by in&s;i&s;t|ing
on the pre&s;ervation of a
wretched being&mdash;rather think
fate has decreed I mu&s;t love you
for ever, and that I dare not op|po&s;e
its will.&mdash;That I am to
&s;ee you no more, and that it will
be criminal to endeavour to &s;ee
you.&mdash;Reflect on the horror
<PB N="56" REF="58">
that threatens me; and &s;uffer me
to take &s;helter in the grave,&mdash;
it is the only re&s;ource I have
left,&mdash;and the only one I wi&s;h to
find! My dear broth$r, &s;aid
<HI>Julia,</HI> rea&s;on will recall you to
your duty;&mdash;time and nece&s;&s;ity
will teach you to forget me.&mdash;
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> letting his head re|cline
upon his brea&s;t, and with|drawing
the hand <HI>Julia</HI> yet held,
did not an&s;wer a word.</P>
<P>SHE waited &s;ome time, and
finding this mournful &s;ilence &s;till
continue, you are then determin|ed
my <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> to indulge this
de&s;pair? you will not even &s;peak
to me! Can you think me un|worthy
of commi&s;eration? can
you think me in&s;en&s;ible to the
&s;acrifice I make? (He remained
&s;ilent, without lifting up his eyes)
&mdash;You are re&s;olved to die my
<PB N="57" REF="59">
dear <HI>Hyppolitus?</HI>&mdash;let it be &s;o!&mdash;
let us die together,&mdash;I will no
longer oppo&s;e it;&mdash;but your
death mu&s;t be &s;peedy indeed if
it precedes mine! Ah! my adored
&s;i&s;ter, he exclaimed, heaving a
deep &s;igh, allow me to be the
only victim!&mdash;You have, believe
me, granted enough to duty:
live my amiable <HI>Julia!</HI> why
&s;hould you wi&s;h to die?&mdash;And
may I not return the que&s;tion?
&mdash;cruel <HI>Hyppolitus!</HI> is it not
your ob&s;tinacy that kills me?
&s;aid &s;he with indignation. <HI>Hyp|politus</HI>
could not bear this re|proach:
&mdash;he &s;uddenly threw him|&s;elf
at her feet, and ki&s;&s;ing her
fair hand, at la&s;t &s;aid&mdash;be ap|pea&s;ed,
my deare&s;t &s;i&s;ter, I from
this moment re&s;olve to pay an
implicit obedience to your will,
&mdash;and to convince you of it, I
will now take &s;ome nouri&s;hment,
<PB N="58" REF="60">
for I had &s;worn to ab&s;tain from
food!&mdash;but promi&s;e to re&s;ign my|&s;elf
to your di&s;po&s;al.<HI>&mdash;Julia,</HI> ex|tremely
alarmed, called <HI>Lucilla,</HI>
and begged her to get &s;omething
for her brother to eat.&mdash;She would
have flown her&s;elf with eager|ne&s;s
to &s;upply him, but was in
too great di&s;order to be &s;een by
the family.</P>
<P>SHE repeated to <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> the
conver&s;ation &s;he had had with her
mother,&mdash;the promi&s;e to carry
her to <HI>France,</HI> and the nece&s;&s;ary
preparations making for the
voyage.&mdash;Though <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
eat very moderately, yet even
this caution did not prevent his
being &s;eized with a violent fever,
of which he felt the fir&s;t attack,
the evening of this di&s;tre&s;sful
day. <HI>Julia</HI> felt the keene&s;t af|fliction
in the mi&s;erable &s;tate &s;he
<PB N="59" REF="61">
was in, &s;he failed not to give him
the mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous attendance;
and her eyes more then her words,
expre&s;&s;ed to <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> how
much &s;he was intere&s;ted in his
recovery;&mdash;but what at ano|ther
time would have given him
the greate&s;t con&s;olation, only
&s;erved now, as fuel to his &s;or|row,
&mdash;he would almo&s;t have
preferred the aver&s;ion of <HI>Julia</HI> to
the tenderne&s;s &s;he di&s;covered,
and the virtuous girl was torn
with the &s;ame conflicting &s;enti|ments.</P>
<P>THE report was &s;oon propa|gated
that <HI>Julia</HI> had determined
to be a reclu&s;e. Tho&s;e to whom
&s;he was the mo&s;t indifferent, re|gretted
it; and could not forbear
te&s;tifying their amazement that a
beauty &s;o accompli&s;hed in mind
and per&s;on, &s;hould devote her|&s;elf
<PB N="60" REF="62">
to a convent! But among&s;t
tho&s;e who lamented it mo&s;t, was
the earl of <HI>Bedford.</HI> He waited
upon the earl of <HI>Douglas</HI> in <HI>Lon|don,</HI>
where his family was, and
a&s;&s;ured him the pa&s;&s;ion he had
for <HI>Julia</HI> was &s;o ardent, and at
the &s;ame time &s;o di&s;intere&s;ted,
that if he would be&s;tow on him
&s;o precious a gift, he de&s;ired no
farther advantages,&mdash;that her
birth and his fortune united, were
&s;ufficient to make <HI>Julia</HI> happy;
&mdash;that all his de&s;ires centred
in the felicity of her he adored,
and that he mu&s;t be the mo&s;t mi|&s;erable
of mankind without her.
My lord, replied to his com|pliment
with all the politene&s;s it
demanded; and then told him
he &s;hould reproach him&s;elf, was
he to deprive his daughter of the
liberty of her choice <HI>of life;</HI>
that though a mona&s;tery was
<PB N="61" REF="63">
what he had a peculiar di&s;like to,
&mdash;yet he did not think he had a
right to oppo&s;e her inclination;
that his lord&s;hip could be no
&s;tranger to the e&s;teem and con|&s;ideration
he had for his per&s;on,
as well as for the hou&s;e of which
Lady <HI>Douglas</HI> was a de&s;cendant;
that if he was able to transfer
his regard to <HI>Lucilla,</HI> his elde&s;t
daughter, who&s;e fortune was
more con&s;iderable, he &s;hould
think him&s;elf happy in the alli|ance.
The earl thanked him as
much as grief would give him
leave, and retired very much mor|tified
with the di&s;appointment.
In the mean time Lady <HI>Douglas</HI>
had bought <HI>Julia</HI> every thing
nece&s;&s;ary for her new vocation,
and acquainted her &s;he might
take leave of her friends, as &s;he
intended to be ready to &s;ail
to <HI>France</HI> in two days.&mdash;
Whatever fortitude <HI>Julia</HI> had
<PB N="62" REF="64">
collected it failed her in this ex|tremity:
&mdash;&s;he went to her bro|thers
appartment,&mdash;her heart
ready to bur&s;t,&mdash;and tears in her
eyes;&mdash;he was gone to bed;&mdash;
&s;he de&s;ired his &s;ervant to leave
the room, and when they were
alone &s;at down by the bed-&s;ide,
beholding him with a look where
&s;orrow was &s;trongly painted, I
am come at la&s;t, &s;aid &s;he, my
dear brother, I am come at la&s;t
to bid you an eternal farewell!
O fatal &s;ound! an eternal farewell,
is that po&s;&s;ible? She was &s;ilent, her
voice was &s;tifled with &s;ighs.&mdash;
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> cro&s;&s;ing his arms,
and lifting his eyes towards <HI>Hea|ven,</HI>
an&s;wered in a tone &s;carcely
articulated,&mdash;Alas! my <HI>Julia,</HI>
the moment is then arrived when
we mu&s;t part! that moment &s;o
terrible to my imagination!&mdash;
rea&s;on forbids me to per&s;uade
<PB N="63" REF="65">
you from a de&s;ign which is the
&s;ource of all the mi&s;fortunes of
my life;&mdash;nay, I will, if it be
po&s;&s;ible, conceal from your ob|&s;ervation
the angui&s;h in which
you leave me, le&s;t pity &s;hould
&s;ubdue your fortitude.&mdash;Yes,
my dear &s;i&s;ter, we mu&s;t part,&mdash;
<HI>Heaven</HI> has decreed it.&mdash;Ah!
<HI>Julia! Julia!</HI> why am I your
brother? turning a &s;ide to con|ceal
the tears that &s;treamed from
his eyes, but <HI>Julia</HI> unwilling to
lo&s;e the&s;e marks of his tender|ne&s;s,
begged him to look upon
her! Ah! do not envy me my
dear <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> &s;aid the affected
fairone, the only con&s;olation that
is left? let me behold your &s;orrow,
&mdash;it cannot encrea&s;e mine,&mdash;
but my heart tells me will rather
&s;ooth its violence.&mdash;O, cruel
virtue!&mdash;au&s;tere duty!&mdash;ten|der
&s;en&s;ibility,&mdash;O, thou, who
<PB N="64" REF="66">
ha&s;t filled that heart with &s;enti|ment,

I am going to immure
my&s;elf for the remainder of a
wretched life;&mdash;will not that
attone for &s;elf-reproach? After
thus giving vent to the exce&s;s of
her grief, &s;he endeavoured to
ri&s;e, but her &s;trength, at that
moment failing, &s;he turned pale,
a &s;udden chillne&s;s &s;eized her,&mdash;
&s;he &s;unk down on a chair.&mdash;
What was the &s;ituation of <HI>Hyp|politus</HI>
at this &s;ight?&mdash;but &s;he
&s;oon recovered from her faint|ing,
and ca&s;ting an agonizing
look on the object of her woe,&mdash;
adieu! dear <HI>Hyppolitus!</HI> adieu!
I have loved too much for your
repo&s;e and mine;&mdash;adieu! my

her chamber, and threw her&s;elf
on the bed.</P>
<P>GRACIOUS <HI>Heaven!</HI> what a
night to both! what a &s;eparation!
what violence to hearts &s;o at|tached!

<P>JULIA, fatigued with having
pa&s;&s;ed the night in tears and
groans, was ju&s;t fallen a&s;leep
when her maid came to tell her
the counte&s;s wanted to &s;peak
with her. She immediately ro&s;e,
and found her in her dre&s;&s;ing-room
with the earl and a prie&s;t;
&mdash;the counte&s;s de&s;ired her to &s;hut
<PB N="66" REF="68">
the door, and &s;it down: my dear
child, continued &s;he, we have a
circum&s;tance to acquaint you
with that will greatly &s;urprize
you,&mdash;&startq;In regard to parental
love and tenderne&s;s, <HI>Julia,</HI> you
have had rea&s;on to believe your|&s;elf
our daughter, but it becomes
nece&s;&s;ary to reveal a &s;ecret that
regards you very e&s;&s;entially:&mdash;
you are no farther allied to us,
than by con&s;anguinity between
your mother and us, who was of
the family of <HI>Montgomery.</HI> This
is <HI>her</HI> picture,&mdash;and this is that
of your father, <HI>Roger,</HI> earl of
<HI>Warwick,</HI> &s;on to the earl of <HI>Sa|li&s;bury.</HI>
There are likewi&s;e, &s;ix
thou&s;and pounds in jewels, which
your excellent mother left in our
hands for you;&mdash;and Mr. <HI>Eaton,</HI>
who was her confe&s;&s;or, and with
her in her la&s;t hour, is the per|&s;on
&s;he intru&s;ted to deliver you
<PB N="67" REF="69">
into our hands. It is now above
thirteen years.&mdash;At the time
when King <HI>Henry,</HI> infatuated
with a pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Anne Boleyne,</HI>
threw off the papal &s;upremacy;
he afterwards condemned to lo&s;e
her head, &s;o great was his levi|ty,
and incon&s;tancy to tho&s;e he
had loved the mo&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>THE counte&s;s then related the
particulars of the death of the
earl and counte&s;s of <HI>Warwick,</HI>
and the motives that induced the
latter to reque&s;t <HI>Julia</HI> might
pa&s;s for her daughter. Had you
been indeed our own (my dear
child I mu&s;t and ought ever to call
you &s;o) we could not have loved
you more:&mdash;keep this &s;ecret, and
take care of not communicating
it to any per&s;on. You &s;ee that
under the young King <HI>Edward,</HI>
the <HI>Catholicks</HI> have more to fear
<PB N="68" REF="70">
than ever;&mdash;your own intere&s;t, as

of your noble parents, is
a tye upon your religious &s;enti|ments.</P>
<P>JULIA,&mdash;di&s;ordered,&mdash;alarm|ed,
&mdash;tran&s;ported with a joy &s;he
&s;trove to repre&s;s, falling at the

pre&s;&s;ed her hands: &startq;Madam,
&s;aid &s;he, the obligations I owe
you are &s;o much the more bind|ing,
as I am not your daughter!
Had I been entitled to that ho|nour,
nature might have prompt|ed
you to give me the education
I have received; but thus cir|cum&s;tanced,
genero&s;ity alone
could engage you to be&s;tow it.
Yet by this di&s;covery, I lo&s;e all I
valued mo&s;t, in being deprived
of appertaining to you,&mdash;you
cea&s;e to be my mother. Alas!
<PB N="69" REF="71">
I have no one now to be|&s;tow

thanked him in the mo&s;t grateful
terms, for this fre&s;h proof of his

&s;he had heard were confirmed by
Mr. <HI>Eaton,</HI> who could not re|&s;train
his tears in beholding <HI>Ju|lia,</HI>
the exact re&s;emblance of her

&s;tole her likene&s;s, unknown to

her. The earl de&s;ired <HI>Julia</HI> to
take the ca&s;ket into her own ap|partment,
which &s;he declined,
begging they would keep it; he
told her as the jewels were her
own property, it was rea&s;onable
&s;he &s;hould wear them, but added
he, my dear daughter, it can
only be for a &s;hort time, &s;ince

retired in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>SHE flew into her clo&s;et, and
finding her&s;elf at liberty, gave
way to the plea&s;ing emotions of
her joy;&mdash;my <HI>God!</HI> cryed &s;he,
am I not the &s;i&s;ter of <HI>Hyppolitus?
Heaven</HI> has wrought this miracle
to &s;ave me from impending ruin!
&mdash;O what a wretch had I
been if this di&s;covery had been
<PB N="71" REF="73">
made a little later? when an ir|revocable
vow had robbed me for
ever of the hope of uniting our
de&s;tiny! How me heart re|proaches
me for concealing it a
moment from my <HI>Hyppolitus!</HI>
I know a thing in which he is &s;en|&s;ibly
intere&s;ted, and I delay the

him, her eyes darting their
brighte&s;t lu&s;tre,&mdash;all animati|on
and rapture;&mdash;whoever had
&s;een her two hours before, could
not have known her:&mdash;&s;he en|treated
<HI>Lucilla</HI> to accompany her
to pay a vi&s;it to <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> whom
they found &s;o pale, dejected, and
languid, from the effects of the
fever, he could &s;carcely &s;peak.
They enquired how he did? he
replied in a faint tone, very ill
indeed! looking with a&s;toni&s;h|ment,
as well as vexation, on
that appearance of gaiety, which
<PB N="72" REF="74">
<HI>Julia</HI> was incapable of conceal|ing;

I never had &s;o much rea&s;on to in|dulge

What! you are going to leave
us for ever, and that is a &s;ubject
of peculiar felicity! yet, for pi|ty's
&s;ake, have at lea&s;t the com|plai&s;ance

fixing her eyes on <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI>
who appeared in the utmo&s;t di&s;|compo&s;ure
at her unexpected
chearfulne&s;s, what delightful
news have I to tell you, &s;aid
&s;he, you will want faith to be|lieve
its reality, it has &s;o much
the air of a fictitious hi&s;tory. I
&s;hall never doubt the truth of
any thing my <HI>Julia</HI> a&s;&s;erts, (replied
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> with impatience)&mdash;
but, my dear &s;i&s;ter, what tale
can be plea&s;ing to him who&s;e
misfortunes are not in the power
of fate to remedy? Were I to
tell you I am not your &s;i&s;ter,
would that afford you any &s;ati&s;|faction?
He was &s;ilent, rai&s;ing
his eyes to <HI>Heaven,</HI> with a look

<HI>Julia</HI> continued. I accu&s;e my|&s;elf
for &s;uffering you to langui&s;h
thus, whil&s;t I have it in my
power to relieve you. Know
then, my dear <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> you
are not my brother! She then
gave a &s;hort detail of all &s;he had
learned, and &s;hewed him the
miniature and jewels.&mdash;Ima|gination
cannot paint what pa&s;|&s;ed
in the heart of <HI>Hyppolitus.</HI>&mdash;
At fir&s;t, exce&s;s of joy deprived
him of &s;peech.&mdash;His eyes
alone, &s;poke the various emo|tions
with which his &s;oul was

which he pre&s;&s;ed with exta&s;y;
and remained a long time, as it
were entranced. At length, like
one who had pa&s;&s;ed from death to
life&mdash;Oh! my charming <HI>Julia,</HI>
he exclaimed, do not flatter my
grief! Can what I hear be po&s;|&s;ible?
<PB N="75" REF="77">
Yet, how &s;till more in|credible
to believe, that eyes &s;o
beautiful could kindle a criminal

to abandon ones &s;elf to all
the tran&s;porting movements the

You are too well acquainted with

When the fir&s;t moments of &s;ur|prize

not lo&s;e a moment in ab&s;ence

the family were alarmed at her

&s;he con&s;idered it as the greate&s;t

of the breach of either.
The blu&s;h of mode&s;ty glowed
upon her cheek, which re&s;ent|ment
of this &s;evere reprimand
&s;oon heightened to a deeper crim|&s;on.

Her downca&s;t eyes were

dignity: I can with truth a&s;|&s;ure
you madam, ingratitude is
a vice I am unacquainted with;
and that the obligations I owe
you are deeply imprinted in my
memory, and on my heart. I
will even confe&s;s the&s;e &s;entiments
I have for <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> betrayed
that un&s;u&s;pecting heart. I be|lieved
I only loved him as a bro|ther,
and I am incapable of deny|ing
madam, what you already
know, that a too tender regard
made a more rapid progre&s;s, than
I would have &s;uffered had it been
in my power to have fore&s;een it.
But I was con&s;cious of the evil
when it was too late to &s;eek a

own frailty &s;econded by the &s;ingu|lar
motives which intere&s;ted me in
his happine&s;s, rendered me un|able
to refu&s;e him &s;ome marks of
&s;en&s;ibility; and if any thing for|tified
me in the indulgence I
have &s;hewn to his attachment
and my own, it has been the
con&s;ideration of not being alto|gether
unworthy your alliance.
It is true, madam, my fortune
is contracted, but immoderate
wealth does not always decide
the happine&s;s of our lives; and
I have been taught to believe an
union of hearts is a more indi&s;|pen&s;ible
ingredient. I have the
honor of being allied to your
family as well as the daughter
of the earl of <HI>Argyl,</HI> whom you

whil&s;t <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> was in

<P>IT was now their eyes were

cried <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> mournfully,

nothing but death alone can &s;e|parate
them! I have taken my
re&s;olution, and I promi&s;e you
never to change it. Not that I
am ignorant of what I have to
encounter: but mi&s;ery it&s;elf will
be dear to me, if it is in&s;tru|mental
in pre&s;erving your <HI>Julia</HI>
ever yours! Her faithful lover,
&s;oftened with gratitude and love,
&s;aid all that the mo&s;t tender and

they agreed &s;he &s;hould reque&s;t
to &s;tay longer at <HI>Bucking|ham,</HI>
and if that was refu&s;ed,
&s;hould give the preference to a

<P>WHILST the lovers were thus

how to prevent the con|&s;equences

from the violence of their
&s;on's pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Julia.</HI> Should
we carry her to <HI>France,</HI> &s;aid they,

love is naturally ingenious, and
the invention of <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> will
not fail to in&s;pire him with &s;ome
&s;tratagem to &s;ee her;&mdash;nor can
we oblige her to take the veil
contrary to her inclination! The
mo&s;t rational expedient is to re|move

<P>DETERMINED upon this me|thod,
as mo&s;t &s;uitable to their

her friend <HI>Lucilla,</HI> they would
allow her more time to con&s;ider

a glimmering hope,&mdash;
that the earl might not be in&s;en|&s;ible

yet con&s;ent to make them happy.

the&s;e words. The &s;troke of a

maid, <HI>Julia,</HI> and perhaps
occa&s;ion her to be removed where
di&s;covery might be impo&s;&s;ible.
&mdash;The conflict in his &s;oul is
not to be de&s;cribed; Lord and
Lady <HI>Doulas</HI> di&s;covered part of
it by the emotion and di&s;order
<PB N="103" REF="105">
of his countenance;&mdash;but they
per&s;evered in di&s;&s;imulation, and

would only have two days to
take leave of his friends. <HI>Hyp|politus,</HI>
concealing, as far as po&s;|&s;ible,
the angui&s;h, he felt, coldly
replied, he &s;hould obey, but that
mea&s;ures &s;o precipitate, gave his
journey rather the appearance of
exile, than travel. He bowed,
and left the room.</P>
<P>A SUDDEN recollection pre|vented
him from &s;peaking im|mediately
to <HI>Julia,</HI> though his
feet had mechanically led him to
<PB N="104" REF="106">

above all things nece&s;&s;ary he
&s;hould fir&s;t &s;ee the friend of his
heart, the earl of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> and
concert with him what conduct

doubting the earl would &s;erve
him on this occa&s;ion with the
&s;ame &s;ecre&s;y and genero&s;ity he
had experienced on &s;o many o|thers.
He followed him into
the park, and found him walk|ing
with Lord <HI>Northampton,</HI>

civilities, he whi&s;pered his friend,
he had &s;omething of importance

us, were per&s;uading me to em|bark

<HI>Mary</HI> has a more legal right

the &s;lighte&s;t anxiety that <HI>Julia</HI>

When he was a little recovered,
he replied in a re&s;pectful tone,

their appartment into the garden,
opened into a covered walk, at
the end of which, by the &s;ide of

another key made, and they

by night, I cannot think it will
be quite con&s;i&s;tent with the rules
of decorum. Are you in a &s;i|tuation,
interrupted <HI>Lucilla,</HI> to
be &s;o &s;crupulou&s;ly nice? My
brother, it is true, is not your
hu&s;band, but he hopes in time
to have that honour; and I pro|mi&s;e
you not to de&s;ert you in
the&s;e interviews;&mdash;and though
I have every thing to dread from
the anger of my father and mo|ther.
I will freely expo&s;e my&s;elf
to its rage, to demon&s;trate my
friend&s;hip for you.&mdash;And what
will be my fate! thou mi&s;tre&s;s

thy <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> who&s;e only mo|tive

be ble$t with the &s;ight of thee
<PB N="113" REF="115">
&s;ometimes? To refu&s;e your
con&s;ent is to command me to de|part.
&mdash;Ah <HI>Julia!</HI> is it you that
will bani&s;h me? Alas! you too
well know the power you both
have over me.&mdash;Yet, con&s;ider
the danger we &s;hall be expo&s;ed

me to death.&mdash;They o|mitted
nothing to rea&s;&s;ure her,
and that very evening <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
took the impre&s;&s;ion of the key in
wax, and di&s;patched it to the earl

be fini&s;hed before he left <HI>Buck|ingham.</HI>
All was punctually ex|ecuted;
and the day <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
took leave of his family, Lord
<HI>Douglas</HI> accompanied him to
<HI>London:</HI> he once intended &s;ee|ing

After the mo&s;t tender farewell,

<P>HYPPOLITUS was introduced
to the amba&s;&s;ador, who was al|ready
on board. As this gentle|man
had a great regard for him,
he frankly explained that &s;ome
invincible rea&s;ons made it ne|ce&s;&s;ary
he &s;hould &s;tay in <HI>England;</HI>
he opened his heart to him, and
conjured him to pity his di&s;tre&s;s|ed

he repo&s;ed would make
the impre&s;&s;ion Moun&s;ieur de

him rea&s;on to expect: and ob|&s;erving
in his manner and coun|tenance,
the mo&s;t favourable di&s;|po&s;ition
to oblige him, he at
length imparted his de&s;ire to
<PB N="115" REF="117">
prevail on him to write to the
earl his father, that his &s;on was
taken ill at <HI>Dieppe;</HI> rather than
at <HI>Paris,</HI> becau&s;e it might natu|rally

and &s;uch of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
nobility as re&s;ided there, would
give frequent intelligence of the
progre&s;s of his di&s;temper; would
he favour him with &s;uch a letter,

the po&s;t-office at a proper

on the &s;ucce&s;s of his plan.
I ea&s;ily comprehend the motive
of your conduct, my dear <HI>Hyp|politus,</HI>
&s;aid the amba&s;&s;ador,
&s;miling, you are in love! and in
compliance to your pa&s;&s;ion, I am
to expo&s;e my&s;elf to your fathers

more cordially to your intere&s;t
<PB N="116" REF="118">
than to the earl's.&mdash;Let us lo&s;e
no time in writing this letter.&mdash;
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> was charmed with
his compliance,&mdash;and thanked
him a thou&s;and times for a &s;er|vice
which appeared &s;o e&s;&s;ential

as he had &s;ent away the barge

wharf, where the earl of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI>
waited in his coach: there were
hor&s;es ready to carry the &s;ervants
to his country &s;eat, under the
care of a gentleman in whom the
earl could confide. As it was
already very late, the two friends
retired to the appartment a&s;&s;ign|ed

<P>THIS lover, who&s;e imagina|tion

<PB N="117" REF="119">
was &s;en&s;ibly touched with the

this, the precautions to be ob&s;erv|ed:
the fear of di&s;covery.&mdash;the
accidents that can neither be
fore&s;een nor avoided, which di&s;|concert
the be&s;t-regulated plans.
&mdash;You are indeed one of <HI>Cu|pid's</HI>

<PB N="118" REF="120">
the earl, plea&s;antly, the extra|vagance
of your pa&s;&s;ion creates
all the&s;e fal&s;e alarms that di&s;turb
you without the lea&s;t foundation.
Are you in&s;en&s;ible to the &s;atis|faction
of being in <HI>London</HI> in|&s;tead
of being to&s;&s;ed upon the
ocean in a yatch; which would
have tran&s;ported you by this time,
I know not how many leagues?
Do you regard as an immate|rial
advantage the ready obedi|ence
you have found in the &s;er|vants
Lord <HI>Douglas</HI> appointed
to attend you? particularly from
the gentleman appointed your tu|tor
who&s;e age and occupation gave
him a kind of right to be &s;ur|prized
at your return, and to
enquire the cau&s;e? Yet he has
been the fir&s;t to &s;et an example
of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the re&s;t! I a&s;|&s;ure
you I regard with wonder
the peculiarity of your good

di&s;po&s;ed to lament your &s;itu|ation,
&s;ince <HI>Julia</HI> in permitting

opinion, with the mo&s;t valuable
proof of her e&s;teem.</P>
<P>You would infer from all this,
&s;aid <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> impatiently, that
I ought to be in the mo&s;t perfect
harmony of &s;pirits? Ah! my
dear lord, if your heart was &s;u&s;|ceptible
of the delicacy of a real
pa&s;&s;ion, you would enter more
deeply into my &s;entiments; but
you are quite a male-coquet,&mdash;
engage the admiration of every
pretty woman by the fine things
you &s;ay to her, whil&s;t your heart
remains unwounded. I have
frequently lamented this in|&s;en&s;ibility,
as I &s;hould have
done any di&s;grace that had be|fallen
you. And I have as often
wi&s;hed you as free as my&s;elf, my

contrary, believe it more likely
to be found in general gallantry.
&mdash;I own the ladies have a
right to our homage, and by a
thou&s;and little delicate atten|tions,
we may merit a &s;hare in
their favour;&mdash;but ought never
to engage in &s;erious attachments
that interrupt our felicity.&mdash;and
make us neglect our duty and
our fortune. <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> was the
&s;lave of the fair &s;ex in peace, but
indifferent to them in war! He
had a new mi&s;tre&s;s as often as he
conquered a new province!&mdash;
Love in heroes &s;hould be no
more than an amu&s;ement.&mdash;
A degree of it is, I confe&s;s, ne|ce&s;&s;ary,
for the attainment of
that politene&s;s peculiar to the

&mdash;but I will always main|tain
that the mo&s;t dangerous thing
in the world, is an intoxication,
which renders us incapable of
every other pur&s;uit, than a|doring
a beautiful idol!&mdash;Per|&s;ons
thus infatuated, become a
burthen to their acquaintance,
as well as to them&s;elves. They
renounce all the plea&s;ures of
&s;ociety. They &s;igh,&mdash;weep,&mdash;
are always unhappy,&mdash;often jea|lous,
and ill-humoured. The
purcha&s;e of one happy moment
is at the expence of a million of
mi&s;erable ones, that precede and
follow it:&mdash;moments &s;o intolera|ble,
they keep the &s;oul in re&s;t|le&s;s

<PB N="122" REF="124">
<HI>God's</HI> &s;ake, interrupted <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI>
a truce with your morali&s;ing:&mdash;
it is &s;o &s;evere, and your ta&s;te &s;o bar|barous
and unpoli&s;hed, that two
more &s;uch conver&s;ations would
render me your inveterate enemy.
&mdash;It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s
my indignation at your defini|tion
of true lovers. The earl
laughed exce&s;&s;ively, and pro|mi&s;ed
his friend not to vex his
&s;pirits any more, on condition he
would allow <HI>him</HI> to love accord|ing
to his own fa&s;hion, without
pre&s;uming to find fault with his
levity.</P>
<P>DAY began to peep before
they had &s;ettled preliminaries;

when dinner was over, <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
entreated his friend to go to
<HI>Buckingham,</HI> and whi&s;per his re|que&s;t
to <HI>Julia</HI> and <HI>Lucilla,</HI> that
<PB N="123" REF="125">

the wood: he performed his em|ba&s;&s;y
to admiration, and as he
was always an agreeable gue&s;t to
Lord and Lady <HI>Douglas,</HI> they
were extremely delighted to &s;ee
him. You come very oppor|tunely
&s;aid the counte&s;s, to con|&s;ole
me for my &s;ons ab&s;ence, I
am very &s;en&s;ibly affected with it.
&mdash;It is a voluntary affliction,
madam, you had the power and
influence of detaining him if
you had thought proper! I
under&s;tand you, &s;ays &s;he: you
think us wrong in &s;ending him
abroad, but I a&s;&s;ure you, though
we &s;uffer greatly from this &s;epa|ration,
it was indi&s;pen&s;ibly ne|ce&s;&s;ary;
one ought to &s;ubdue all
&s;elfi&s;h tenderne&s;s for the advan|tage
of a darling &s;on.&mdash;After
three years travel, we &s;hall &s;ee
him with redoubled tran&s;port.&mdash;
<PB N="124" REF="126">
<HI>Lucilla</HI> and <HI>Julia</HI> were pre&s;ent at
this conver&s;ation, and the earl

<HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> could
only draw <HI>Lucilla</HI> apart, whil&s;t
the earl was engaged in addre&s;|&s;ing
<HI>Julia.</HI> All that regarded
the time of meeting, was &s;ettled
for the en&s;uing night, and the
earl &s;hortened his vi&s;it to gratify
his friend's impatience. They
thought it nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;gui&s;e
their per&s;ons for fear of being
di&s;covered on the road in wigs
of an oppo&s;ite colour to their hair;
jockey caps tied clo&s;e over their
faces, and hor&s;emens coats, an&s;|wered
the purpo&s;e. They left
<HI>London</HI> at ten o' clock. The
night was remarkably fine;&mdash;the
country &s;till and tranquil; their
valet held their hor&s;es, whil&s;t
they repaired to the little gate,
which they found unlocked.&mdash;
<PB N="125" REF="127">
They entered the garden;
and the two ladies, who were at
no great di&s;tance, hearing their

<P>THE joy of <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> and
<HI>Julia</HI> was inexpre&s;&s;ible; after
&s;ome time &s;pent in general con|ver&s;ation,
without quitting the

&mdash;the lover gave his hand to
<HI>Julia,</HI> and the earl walked by
<HI>Lucilla.</HI>&mdash;Thank <HI>Heaven,</HI> our ab|&s;ence
has not been long, my

&mdash;You are again returned in &s;pite
of their machinations to di&s;unite
us! Had my heart been &s;lightly
engaged, my charming <HI>Julia,</HI> I
might have found it more dif|ficult
to over&s;et their &s;chemes,
but the pa&s;&s;ion you have in&s;pired
is too &s;trong not to be fruitful in
devices to oppo&s;e whatever ob|&s;tacles
<PB N="126" REF="128">
they may contrive to part
us. You were no &s;ooner gone,
re&s;umed <HI>Julia,</HI> than the counte&s;s
was particular in her civilities;

&s;ome profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip,
which rather &s;urprized me, as
we were circum&s;tanced, &s;aid
&s;he had rea&s;on to believe I had
no intention of taking the veil;
and, as that was the ca&s;e, &s;he
thought it incumbent on her to
advi&s;e me, as the be&s;t friend and
relation I had in the world, to
con&s;ider the earl of <HI>Bedford's</HI>
propo&s;al dive&s;ted of prejudice:
that he was a man of honour,
family, and fortune. She a&s;|&s;ured
me in few words, a con|nection
with you was ab&s;olutely
impo&s;&s;ible: that &s;he would free|ly
confe&s;s, I was the only cau&s;e
of their &s;ending you abroad, and
that her lord was re&s;olved never to
<PB N="127" REF="129">
con&s;ent to your return till I was
di&s;po&s;ed of.&mdash;And what was
your reply, my deare&s;t love? &s;aid
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> with emotion: that
as to accepting the earl of <HI>Bed|ford's</HI>
addre&s;&s;es, my inflexibility
was equal to Lord <HI>Douglas's:</HI>
that I begged her lady&s;hip never
would renew the &s;ubject, for no|thing
could conquer my aver&s;ion:
and as you were to travel three
years, I had &s;ome rea&s;on to hope
&s;he would give me longer time
to determine my choice of life:
that it was of great importance
to me, and therefore could not
be too maturely con&s;idered.</P>
<P>LADY <HI>Douglas</HI> did not refu&s;e
her acquie&s;cence in the&s;e &s;enti|ments;
and as the earl of <HI>Bed|ford</HI>
came to-day, whil&s;t my Lord
<HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> was here, and began to
pe&s;ter me with his love, I told
<PB N="128" REF="130">
him I could no longer conceal
that his importunities had ex|hau&s;ted
my patience:&mdash;hitherto
I had treated him only with in|difference,
but now the ca&s;e was
extremely altered, and I thought
it ju&s;t he &s;hould know my objec|tions
were in&s;urmountable: if
he wi&s;hed to make me unhappy,
the repitition of his vi&s;its would
effectually an&s;wer that purpo&s;e.
What madam, he exclaimed, do
you forbid me to &s;ee you? Yes,
&s;ir, I earne&s;tly entreat you not to
interrupt my repo&s;e.&mdash;Madam,
you throw me into di&s;pair, you
deprive me of the only felicity of
my life. I love you to adoration!
What mu&s;t be my mi&s;ery if you
refu&s;e to let me &s;ee you? My
lord, you will endeavour to &s;ub|due
a partiality trouble&s;ome to
me, and the &s;ource of unnece&s;|&s;ary
vexation to your&s;elf. Say|ing
<PB N="129" REF="131">
this, I left him, with all the
marks of angui&s;h in his counte|nance.
&mdash;O, my heart's trea|&s;ure!
how happy do you make
me! and how immen&s;e is my
debt of gratitude for &s;uch a &s;a|crifice!
&s;aid the enraptured <HI>Hyp|politus.</HI>
You are mi&s;taken, re|plied
<HI>Julia,</HI>&mdash;I make no &s;acri|fice.
&mdash;I feel too great &s;atisfac|tion

this impertinent man, for you to
place it to your account, or be
under the lea&s;t obligation.</P>
<P>TIME glided away in recipro|cal
prote&s;tations of eternal fide|lity,
and promi&s;es to meet as fre|quently
as po&s;&s;ible. The earl of
<HI>Su&s;&s;ex's</HI> &s;ervant was to ride through
<HI>Buckingham</HI> every morning, and
when he &s;aw flower pots at <HI>Julia's</HI>
window, it was to be a &s;ignal for
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> to repair to the wood
<PB N="130" REF="132">
at night. The&s;e points being &s;et|tled,
they found it nece&s;&s;ary to
&s;eparate, but not before Lord
<HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Lucilla</HI> had repeatedly
informed them it was near break
of day.</P>
<P>HYPPOLITUS was not tardy
in &s;ending the amba&s;&s;ador's let|ter
to his father, with an account
of his illne&s;s, which di&s;turbed
the tranquillity of the family, and
filled the earl and counte&s;s with
alarming apprehen&s;ions.&mdash;He
con&s;tantly dated his own letters
from <HI>Dieppe,</HI> &s;ometimes inform|ing
them he was better,&mdash;&s;ome|times
wor&s;e,&mdash;as he judged mo&s;t
convenient.&mdash;The intercou&s;e
between <HI>Julia</HI> and <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI>
was entirely un&s;u&s;pected for more
than two months.&mdash;They en|joyed
the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing each
other frequently without the lea&s;t
<PB N="131" REF="133">
interruption;&mdash;but fortune apt
to be envious of the too great
&s;atisfaction of lovers, thought it
time to mole&s;t them.</P>
<P>WHEN the earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> re|ceived
his &s;entence of di&s;mi&s;|&s;ion,
he quitted the ca&s;tle in the
mo&s;t poignant di&s;tre&s;s, with a
re&s;olution to decline his addre&s;|&s;es,
and if po&s;&s;ible forget the fair
cau&s;e of his wretchedne&s;s for e|ver.
He collected every argu|ment
capable of affording him
comfort; frequented publick di|ver&s;ions
more than he had been
accu&s;tomed, and &s;ought with
diligence &s;ome irre&s;i&s;table beau|ty
to captivate his heart. But
<HI>Julia's</HI> &s;uperiority was &s;o con|fe&s;&s;edly
apparent, and &s;he gained
&s;o much by compari&s;on with o|ther
women, that he de&s;pi&s;ed
their charms, whil&s;t reflection
<PB N="132" REF="134">
added fre&s;h fuel to his flame. It
burnt with a violence that im|pelled
him to have re&s;ource to
de&s;perate remedies; and the ex|travagance
of a heated imagi|nation
prompted him to carry
her off by force. I am certain,
&s;aid he to one of his friends, Lord
<HI>Douglas</HI> would be plea&s;ed with
my alliance, as the counte&s;s is
my relation, and he has even
offered me his elde&s;t daughter.
It is true he will not exert his
authority to con&s;train the unwil|ling
hand of <HI>Julia,</HI> but when
once I am ma&s;ter of it, I &s;hall not
find him an irreconcileable
enemy; &s;o far from it, I know
he will u&s;e his influence to ren|der
me happy.</P>
<P>THE de&s;ign once formed, he
&s;ought with eagerne&s;s to accele|rate
its execution. He recol|lected
<PB N="133" REF="135">
the gardiner of <HI>Bucking|ham</HI>
formerly lived in his family,
and knew him to be avaricious,
and bold enough to a&s;&s;i&s;t in &s;uch

directly, and after giving him
one bribe, and the promi&s;e of a|nother,
ventured to open his de|&s;ign,
and con&s;ult him on the
proper mea&s;ures to be pur&s;ued.
Your &s;cheme my lord, appears
to me very fea&s;ible, &s;aid the gar|diner,
I have the key to a door
at the extremity of the garden,
which leads through a covered
alley to a back &s;tair ca&s;e oppo&s;ite

<P><PB N="134" REF="136">
THE earl of <HI>Bedford,</HI> found
the&s;e circum&s;tances favourable,

to the gate, the gardiner had
pointed out, with two gentle|men
on whom he could depend,
at about eleven at night. One
of the&s;e gentlemen led their hor&s;es
into a valley, unperceived, whil&s;t
the earl and the other entered
the garden as &s;ilently as po&s;&s;ible.

<P>THE earl of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> contem|plated
this &s;cene in the utmo&s;t

manner that did not alleviate it.
What a dangerous friend are you,
my lord, to treat the folly of my
&s;on with &s;uch unju&s;tifiable com|plai&s;ance.
<PB N="143" REF="145">
Alas! you &s;ee to what
wretchedne&s;s we are reduced:&mdash;
can there be a more deplorable

Yes, madam, &s;aid the earl of
<HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> with re&s;olution, that of
your &s;on is more worthy of com|mi&s;eration!
The proof of obe|dience
you demanded was too
rigid. Why would you in&s;i&s;t
upon his ab&s;ence, when you knew
how &s;trongly his heart was en|gaged?
To cure a pa&s;&s;ion we
di&s;approved, interrupted the
counte&s;s, we hoped that ab&s;ence
would have wrought the effect
it does commonly in the hearts
of men; and if my &s;on had not
found a friend &s;o ready to com|ply
with the frenzy of his pa&s;|&s;ion,
I have not the lea&s;t doubt
but <HI>Julia</HI> had by this time been
forgot.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="146">
DURING this altercation, the
&s;urgeons who examined the earl
of <HI>Bedford's</HI> wounds, came to
make their report to Lord <HI>Doug|la$,</HI>
that they had found three,
one of which they feared was
mortal. The ju&s;tice immediately
demanded <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> might be
taken into cu&s;tody, and commit|ted
to <HI>Newgate;</HI> a propo&s;al that
awakened all the feelings of pa|rental
affection in Lord <HI>Douglas.</HI>
He an&s;wered he never could con|&s;ent
to give up his &s;on, but was
ready to be bound in two thou|&s;and
pounds &s;ecurity for his ap|pearance.
His bail was accept|ed,
and the officers of ju&s;tice
took their leave. Lord and La|dy
<HI>Douglas</HI> wi&s;hed the earl of
<HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> had followed their exam|ple,
whom they regarded with
re&s;entment: but that generous
friend, feigning not to ob&s;erve
<PB N="145" REF="147">
the apparent marks of di&s;gu&s;t,
which his &s;en&s;ibility felt, he&s;i|tated
not to a&s;&s;ure them he would
&s;hare the &s;ame fortune with <HI>Hyp|politus!</HI>
He never would aban|don
him;&mdash;and if he peri&s;hed,
it &s;hould not be alone!</P>
<P>THE two friends were &s;uffer|ed
to remain in the &s;ame appart|ment,
carefully &s;ecured; whil&s;t
<HI>Lucilla</HI> and <HI>Julia,</HI> were equally
guarded in another.</P>
<P>WHEN Lord <HI>Douglas</HI> was &s;a|tisfied
they could not e&s;cape, he
&s;et out with his lady for <HI>London,</HI>
and drove directly to the coun|te&s;s
of <HI>Bedford's,</HI> who had been
long acquainted with her &s;on's
attachment to <HI>Julia,</HI> and con|&s;ented
to his choice; but was
not yet informed of the melan|choly
event at <HI>Buckingham:</HI> &s;he
<PB N="146" REF="148">
heard it with lively emotions of
&s;urprize and concern. When
the earl had related all the cir|cum&s;tances,
You will perceive
madam, &s;aid he, a pro&s;ecution,
though it may involve us in much
trouble and perplexity, mu&s;t in
the end, be productive of &s;till
greater to your&s;elf, when it &s;hall
be proved that the earl of <HI>Bed|ford</HI>
attempted to carry off <HI>Julia</HI>
by force, and that her brother in
affecting her re&s;cue, dangerou&s;ly
wounded the ravi&s;her. The lat|ter
alone will appear culpable.&mdash;
But if your lady&s;hip will li&s;ten
to the cordiality of my propo&s;al,
I will bani&s;h the painful object
from your &s;ight, for three years,
and if <HI>Heaven</HI> hearkens to our
prayers in favour of your &s;on's
recovery, and he &s;till per&s;everes
in his pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Julia,</HI> I en|gage
my word to promote their
<PB N="147" REF="149">
union to the utmo&s;t of my
power.</P>
<P>THE counte&s;s did not choo&s;e
to determine any thing till &s;he
had fir&s;t con&s;ulted her family and
friends; who no &s;ooner heard of
the misfortune, than they came
to offer their a&s;&s;i&s;tance and advice,
and after a careful enquiry into
the circum&s;tances, were of o|pinion,
no further conce&s;&s;ions
could be required; and were
even &s;urprized at the genero&s;ity
of the earl of <HI>Douglas's</HI> offer, to
&s;end his &s;on abroad for three years;
as they were ignorant of the &s;e|cret
motive of his conduct.</P>
<P>MATTERS being thus ami|cably
adju&s;ted, the earl went to
<HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> where he heard there
was a ve&s;&s;el loading for <HI>Leghorn;</HI>
this, he thought a favourable op|portunity
<PB N="148" REF="150">
for <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> not
doubting the beauties of <HI>Italy</HI>
would &s;oon make him forget
<HI>England,</HI> and his engagements
there. He &s;ettled all prelimina|ries
with the captain, and find|ing
he waited only for a fair wind,
which there would not be time
to advertize him of at <HI>Bucking|ham,</HI>
he &s;ent for his &s;on to <HI>Lon|don</HI>
the next day.</P>
<P>BUT what was the &s;ituation
of <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> who had every
thing to fear for the object of his
love and was well a&s;&s;ured his father
would take the mo&s;t infallible
mea&s;ures to &s;eparate him from
her for ever! The&s;e afflicting
thoughts had plunged him into
the deepe&s;t de&s;pair, if his native
fortitude had not been &s;uperior to
calamity. He attempted in vain,
to bribe the &s;ervants to connive
<PB N="149" REF="151">
at his e&s;cape; but was more &s;uc|ce&s;sfull
in prevailing on them to
di&s;clo&s;e all they knew of his fa|ther's
proceedings. They loved
and re&s;pected <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> as their
&s;econd ma&s;ter, and informed
him of his expedition to <HI>Grave&s;|and,</HI>
which he &s;aw was a leading
&s;tep effectually to oppo&s;e his dar|ling
wi&s;hes. He reque&s;ted the
footman who attended him, to
convey a letter to <HI>Julia,</HI> and bring
an an&s;wer. After a little he&s;i|tation
he con&s;ented, reflecting
that the &s;ecrets between a bro|ther
and a &s;i&s;ter, were not of a
nature to offend a parent. <HI>Hyp|politus,</HI>
on his &s;ide, hazarded
nothing from a di&s;covery, as his
family already knew the extent
of his pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Julia.</HI> He
wrote to her thus:</P>

&s;o hazardous, that after experi|encing

of him, to return with <HI>Zacti,</HI>
who was my relation, and the
cardinal expre&s;&s;ed his gratitude

&s;tronge&s;t terms. And though
inve&s;ted with the papal dignity a

&s;hould you evade my determined
purpo&s;e, by &s;taying in <HI>England,</HI>
or even by returning before the
expiration of three years, I will
be the fir&s;t to deliver you into
the hands of ju&s;tice; when per|haps,
you will be more &s;en&s;ible
of the mortifications attending a
pri&s;on than of the remon&s;trances
of an indulgent parent. Your
liberty, my &s;on, is re&s;tored, but
the enjoyment of it is re&s;erved for
any other country than your own.
&mdash;If the earl of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> who has
been &s;o faithfully attached to
your irregularities, will act like
a real friend, he will advi&s;e you
to &s;ubmit; and that <HI>Julia,</HI> may
reccommend the &s;ame coun&s;el
<PB N="161" REF="163">
uncon&s;trained we leave you to|ther.&endq;</P>
<P>WITH the&s;e words he left the
room without expecting a reply.
The counte&s;s followed,&mdash;whil&s;t
the earl of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Lucilla</HI>
conver&s;ed at one end of the room,
leaving the lovers to expre&s;s the
angui&s;h of their hearts to each
other. <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> pre&s;&s;ed his
<HI>Julia's</HI> hand, whil&s;t he kneeled
at her feet, gazing on her
with unutterable tenderne&s;s, and
breathing out his &s;oul in &s;ighs.
A language intelligible and ef|fecting
to both.<HI>&mdash;Julia</HI> fir&s;t
broke the mournful &s;ilence,&mdash;
Arm your&s;elf again&s;t the malice
of fate, &s;aid &s;he, my dear and
too unfortunate <HI>Hyppolitus!</HI> If
our &s;ufferings are ever &s;o great,
the tender regard we have for
<PB N="162" REF="164">
each other is &s;till greater.&mdash;A
&s;ingle event may change the &s;ad
&s;tate of our affairs.&mdash;You mu&s;t
leave <HI>England;&mdash;</HI> I &s;ee no way
to avoid it.&mdash;Let us &s;ubmit
with propriety.&mdash;They will not
find it po&s;&s;ible to &s;ucceed in di|viding
two hearts pierced with
the &s;ame arrow. Before the three
years they talk of, are accom|pli&s;hed,
<HI>&mdash;Heaven</HI> will perhaps
in pity, &s;horten the term of ab|&s;ence.
&mdash;Ah! <HI>Julia,</HI> he ex|claimed,
how violent is the ef|fort
you make to &s;upport my
&s;inking courage! You are &s;o|licitous
to comfort me with di&s;|tant
and uncertain hopes when I
am tortured with agony&mdash;torn
from the only ble&s;&s;ing that is
dear to me.&mdash;My eyes are ri|vetted
upon you.&mdash;Oh! it is
the la&s;t time!&mdash;Alas! my
<HI>Julia,</HI> I tremble at the de&s;tiny
<PB N="163" REF="165">
which awaits you.&mdash;How will
you be able to endure life in a
place &s;o hateful.&mdash;where you are
treated with &s;uch indignity.&mdash;
This di&s;tracting thought is a
&s;ource of mortal inquietude that
will follow me every where? You
are too ingenious in &s;eeking fre&s;h
&s;ubjects of torment. I &s;hall be
here, my <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> as I &s;hould
be whereever I was, only occu|pied
with your idea, indifferent
to all things el&s;e.&mdash;I &s;hall be
in&s;en&s;ible of the indulgence or
&s;everity I may receive from
others.&mdash;You will write to me
my <HI>Julia?</HI> I wi&s;h, &s;he replied,
you may receive all I write,&mdash;
you will never then be long
without that con&s;olation. But
how are we to manage our cor|re&s;pondence?
&mdash;The earl and
<HI>Lucilla,</HI> who were not &s;o inte|re&s;ted
in their own conver&s;ation
<PB N="164" REF="166">
as to be inattentive to their un|happy
friends, heard the&s;e la&s;t
words, they approached them,
and &s;aid that care was their pro|vince,
that they would not keep
them in &s;u&s;pence concerning
their intentions, for they had
&s;ettled every thing to facilitate
their corre&s;pondence.&mdash;That
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> mu&s;t inclo&s;e his letters
to the earl, who would deliver
them to <HI>Lucilla.&mdash;</HI> The cruel
moment of parting drew near.&mdash;
The fair one had employed a
jeweller to &s;et a locket of her
hair in a true lover's knot, encir|cled
with diamonds; below were
two hearts pierced with the &s;ame
arrow;&mdash;and this motto:
&mdash;&startq;United for ever.&endq; Accept
this, my dear <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> &s;aid
&s;he, you alone know its value.
He was tran&s;ported at receiving
a favour he had not dared to re|que&s;t,
<PB N="165" REF="167">
and devoutly ki&s;&s;ed this
&s;weet pledge of his <HI>Julia's</HI> af|fection:
The heart-rending a|dieu
was repeated;&mdash;they em|braced.
&mdash;The earl and <HI>Lucilla</HI>
mingled their tears in this af|fecting
&s;cene. In the height of
their di&s;tre&s;s, Lord and Lady
<HI>Douglas</HI> entered, and de&s;ired their
&s;on to follow them; he appear|ed
as much thunder&s;truck at
the command, as if it had been
unexpected. He ca&s;t a mourn|ful
look on <HI>Julia,</HI> who&s;e down|ca&s;t
eyes were filled with tears.
<HI>Lucilla</HI> and his friend perceiveing
him involved in grief and irre|&s;olution,
took each of them an
arm, and led <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> down
the &s;tairs. He took the tender|e&s;t
farewell of his beloved &s;i&s;ter,
and repeated &s;everal times that
the only ardent proof of friend|&s;hip
he wi&s;hed her to give, was
<PB N="166" REF="168">
to devote her&s;elf tenderly to <HI>Julia,</HI>
and cheri&s;h his image in her
heart.</P>
<P>HE departed, and <HI>Julia</HI> was
left at liberty to vent the grief
&s;he had &s;o long repre&s;&s;ed, in bit|ter
&s;ighs and complaints. It
was in vain <HI>Lucilla</HI> e&s;&s;ayed to
comfort her. The moment &s;he
lo&s;t &s;ight of her dear <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI>
&s;he threw her&s;elf on the ground,
&mdash;re&s;ting her head on <HI>Lucilla's</HI>
lap, pouring forth &s;uch tender
expre&s;&s;ions of woe, as would
have a&s;&s;waged the &s;orrows of her
lover, could he have heard him|&s;elf
&s;o lamented. <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI>
ab&s;orbed in mournful and &s;ilent
grief, did not open his eyes till
they were on board the &s;hip,
when he was to bid adieu to his
dear and generous friend, the
earl of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex.</HI> All his wounds
<PB N="167" REF="169">
opened afre&s;h, at the dreadful
&s;eparation.&mdash;This is the la&s;t
&s;troke,&mdash;my dear friend,&mdash;&s;aid
he, embracing him, we too
mu&s;t part! However you may
imagine, that what I have alrea|dy
been torn from, renders me
in&s;en&s;ible of every other lo&s;s; I
have rea&s;on to believe, from the
feelings of my heart at this mo|ment,
that the mo&s;t ardent love
is con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;tronge&s;t
friend&s;hip!&mdash;Continue yours
for me, my dear lord, in ju&s;tice
to the&s;e &s;entiments.&mdash;He was
unable to utter more,&mdash;and the
earl's agitation was &s;o violent,
he could only embrace him with
&s;treaming eyes, which demon|&s;trated
the exce&s;s of his regard &s;o
evidently, that Lord and Lady
<HI>Douglas</HI> acknowledged their ob|ligations
to him in their hearts,
notwith&s;tanding the chagrine he
<PB N="168" REF="170">
had given them in a&s;&s;i&s;ting the
mea&s;ures of <HI>Hyppolitus.</HI> They
overwhelmed their &s;on with
torrents of advice; but he was
&s;o con&s;cious that they were the
&s;ole authors of the mi&s;ery he &s;uf|fered,
he would not endeavour
to re&s;train his emotions, or con|ceal
his &s;entiments, but bur&s;t in|to
&s;uch pathetic exclamations, as
would have touched any heart
but that of an incen&s;ed parent.
The &s;ervants who attended him,
were new ones, for the earl and
counte&s;s were &s;u&s;picious of tho&s;e
&s;ent to Lord <HI>Su&s;&s;ex's</HI> country

<P>HYPPPOLITUS gave him mo|ney
to reward their fidelity, and

&mdash;My lord took the greate&s;t part
into his own family, and placed
the re&s;t with his friends.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="171">
HIS lord&s;hip entered the barge
with the earl and counte&s;s of
<HI>Douglas,</HI> who did not choo&s;e to

They had not yet lo&s;t &s;ight of

more than five days at &s;ea when
a violent &s;torm aro&s;e, threaten|ning
immediated de&s;truction.
&mdash;The &s;trength and diligence of
the &s;ailors were in&s;ufficient to

and regarding with
timid eyes the planks, every

<HI>&mdash;Hyppolitus,</HI> alone, appeared
collected, and di&s;covered no ex|traordinary
emotion! More re|&s;olute
in danger than the&s;e men
accu&s;tomed to warring elements,
he prepared to receive the gloomy
tyrant with undaunted fortitude.
He &s;ometimes even wi&s;hed to
behold him as the only cure for
his misfortunes;&mdash;whil&s;t the
pre&s;ence of mind he retained,
and the humanity of his di&s;po|&s;ition
<PB N="171" REF="173">
prompted him to give the
nece&s;&s;ary orders for &s;aving the
&s;hip.</P>
<P>AT length the horrible tem|pe&s;t
&s;ub&s;ided. The <HI>Heavens</HI> be|came
&s;erene; the hail, and the
thunder cea&s;ed; and &s;o &s;udden a
calm &s;ucceeded, that the &s;ea
&s;eemed only agitated by the
breath of gentle zephyrs. All
laboured with the utmo&s;t ala|crity
to repair the damage &s;u&s;|tained,
nor was there any time
to lo&s;e, for &s;carcely was one
danger &s;urmounted, when ano|ther
yet more formidable, made
its appearance: this was the fa|mous
Cor&s;air <HI>Dragut-Rais,</HI> &s;o
known and dreaded on that coa&s;t.
No &s;ooner did the pyrate di&s;cern
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> ve&s;&s;el, than he pre|pared
to engage; fir&s;t &s;ending a
&s;ummons to her to &s;trike. It
<PB N="172" REF="174">
was now that <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> made a
truce with his &s;orrows.&mdash;He
replied as if he had been com|mander,
and the order had been
addre&s;&s;ed to him; and &s;ent the
Cor&s;air a haughty defiance.&mdash;
He animated the captain to a vi|gorous
re&s;i&s;tance; he encouraged
the &s;oldiers and &s;ailors;&mdash;and his
example &s;ufficed to in&s;pire with
courage tho&s;e who were before
intimidated. The two &s;hips, af|ter
firing &s;everal broad&s;ides at
each other, began to grapple,
and came to a clo&s;e engagement
on the decks. It &s;eemed as if
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> was multiplied:&mdash;
he was every where to attack
and to defend;&mdash;inevitable death
was in his &s;trokes.&mdash;He flew
with incredible &s;wiftne&s;s from
the poop to the prow;&mdash;and in
an in&s;tant, without balancing
objections,&mdash;he was in the ene|mies
<PB N="173" REF="175">
&s;hip,&mdash;and though &s;up|ported
by only a handful of &s;ol|diers,
the &s;ight of the danger to
which he was expo&s;ed, could
not &s;top him; and his intrepi|dity
&s;o intimidated the <HI>Turks,</HI>
that <HI>Dragut-Rais,</HI> after oppo&s;ing
him gallantly &s;ome time, &s;eeing
nothing in rever&s;ion but a &s;peedy
death, or certain captivity,&mdash;
thought to find his &s;afety in
flight. He availed him&s;elf of
the general di&s;order and confu|&s;ion,
to give the nece&s;&s;ary orders;
nor was the execution difficult;
for the time <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> was board|ing
the enemy, he &s;aw a &s;ingle
man in his own &s;hip, cutting
down all before him: he had
formed a rampart round him of
dead and dying bodies, and no
one dared to attack him. A
&s;entiment of emulation tempted
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> to engage &s;o brave a
<PB N="174" REF="176">
rival, he returned to the deck,
&mdash;and had ju&s;t commenced a
combat, which had probably
proved mortal to both, when the
<HI>Cor&s;air's</HI> ve&s;&s;el drew up her grap|pling
irons, and hoi&s;ting all her
&s;ail, was &s;oon at a con&s;iderable
di&s;tance; with not le&s;s expedi|tion
did the whole &s;hip's crew
fly to part the brave combatants,
they had both received &s;everal
wounds; and he who was de|fending
the <HI>Turk's</HI> banner, per|ceiving
him&s;elf de&s;erted, finding
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion the only part left;
cho&s;e to re&s;ign his &s;word to <HI>Hyp|politus,</HI>
as the mo&s;t worthy of
being his protector. Behave to
me, &s;aid the &s;tranger in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI>
with the &s;ame lenity I have al|ways
behaved to tho&s;e of your
nation. They have had rea&s;on

Sir, &s;aid <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> you will ne|ver
<PB N="175" REF="177">

my want of it!</P>
<P>HE went immediately to the
captain, and required his parti|cular
regard to a brave officer,
who&s;e valour was worthy of ad|miration.
The captain replied,
without your a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;ir, we
&s;hould not have come off with &s;o
much glory. I leave you the
intire di&s;po&s;al of the man who
has intere&s;ted your benevolence.
&mdash;But I have one favour to re|que&s;t,
which is that you will at|tend
to your own &s;ituation:&mdash;
you are wounded;&mdash;for <HI>God's</HI>
&s;ake, &s;uffer your&s;elf to be taken
care of.<HI>&mdash;Hyppolitus</HI> returned
thanks for his polite cordiality,
and as he had lo&s;t a great quan|tity
of blood, and was extremely
faint, it was thought proper he
&s;hould go to bed.&mdash;But &s;carcely
<PB N="176" REF="178">
had he re&s;ted five minutes, when
anxiety for his captive occa&s;ioned
him to de&s;ire he might be ac|commodated
with a bed in his ap|partment,

to &s;uffer his wounds to be ex|amined
and dre&s;&s;ed. <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
had the &s;atisfaction of hearing
they were not dangerous, and if
this had been his only affliction,
he had been &s;oon relieved. But
no &s;ooner was the <HI>warrior</HI> at ea&s;e,
than the <HI>lover</HI> was wretched.&mdash;
This melancholy kept him awake
&s;everal whole nights, and the
&s;tranger heard him frequently ex|claim
Oh, <HI>Julia, Julia,</HI> I have
lo&s;t all in lo&s;ing thee: nothing
can ever con&s;ole me in thy ab|&s;ence!</P>
<P>IT did not require the pene|tration
<HI>Muley</HI> (the name of the

<PB N="177" REF="179">
out <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> was in love, and
under the influence of &s;ome un|happy

virtuous and beneficent;
of manners &s;o oppo&s;ite to &s;uch a

<HI>Muley</HI> fetched a deep
&s;igh, and &s;aid, we are not always
ma&s;ters of our de&s;tiny! I agree
with you, that <HI>Heaven</HI> did not
originally intend me for a pyrate,
and that I am only &s;o by the ty|ranny
of <HI>Dragut-Rais!</HI> This
an&s;wer excited the curio&s;ity of
<HI>Hyppolitus.</HI>&mdash;He who had been
uninfluenced by that or any other
pa&s;&s;ions but love and glory, &s;ince
<PB N="178" REF="180">

enquire your name, and I con|&s;ider
it as a kind of miracle that
providence has delivered me in|to
the hands of a &s;on of the earl
of <HI>Douglas!</HI></P>
<P>WHILST he was &s;peaking,
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> examined his counte|nance
more attentively than he
had ever yet done, and &s;ound a
<PB N="179" REF="181">
certain &s;imilarity of air and fea|tures
between him and his be|loved
<HI>Julia,,</HI> that confounded his
imagination. Ah! do not longer
defer the plea&s;ure I &s;hall have in
knowing you! Sir, my name is all
you can recollect, re&s;umed <HI>Muley,</HI>
and, perhaps, you may have &s;ome|times
heard of my misfortunes:
I am the earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> who
'tis believed peri&s;hed in the <HI>Ve|netian</HI>
&s;ervice about fourteen years
&s;ince. At the&s;e words <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
broke into a loud exclamation of
joy, and was &s;o tran&s;ported, that
the earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> was more
than a little a&s;toni&s;hed.</P>
<P>AFTER mutual congratulati|ons,
on this di&s;covery, <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
conjured him to give a detail of
his adventures, as no per&s;on in
the world was more cordially in|tere&s;ted
in them than him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="182">
I SHALL &s;oon gratify your cu|rio&s;ity,
&s;aid the earl, I am a <HI>Ca|tholic.</HI>
You know my family.
I married one of the mo&s;t virtu|ous
and beautiful women in the
world; but fortune jealous of the
happy dome&s;tic tranquility I en|joyed,
&s;eparated us. I was un|fortunately
included in a pro&s;e|cution
again&s;t Lord <HI>Nevil,</HI> to
whom I was nearly related; and
the king, who brought him to
the &s;caffold, &s;uffered him&s;elf to
be per&s;waded I had murmured
again&s;t his inju&s;tice. From that
in&s;tant I became the object of his
hatred; and to avoid being that
of his vengeance, I was reduced
to the cruel nece&s;&s;ity of leaving
my country and my wife.&mdash;
With that be&s;t of women I like|wi&s;e
left our only child, <HI>Julia,</HI>
then two years old, who was in|finitely
dear to me. If the earl
<PB N="181" REF="183">
had chanced to have ca&s;t his eyes
on <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> he mu&s;t have re|marked
the variations in his
countenance, at the mention of
a name &s;o beloved; but engro&s;s|ed
with the naration he was giv|ing,
he proceeded thus:</P>
<P>I OFFERED my &s;ervice to <HI>Ca|pello,</HI>
the <HI>Venetian</HI> commander,
embarked with him to join the
fleets of the pope and emperor.
We attacked <HI>Barba-Ro&s;&s;a,</HI> I had
the command of a galley, which
more than once faced the Cor&s;air
<HI>Dragut Rais</HI> with great advan|tage
to us, and misfortune to him;
for I killed his brother, <HI>Zikin
Rais,</HI> dear to him as life. He
&s;wore vengeance, and in pro&s;ecu|tion
of it, when we were in the
gulph of <HI>Laita,</HI> and Prince <HI>Do|ria</HI>
made that incomprehen&s;ible
retreat which a&s;toni&s;hed the world,
<PB N="182" REF="184">
and for which no rea&s;on has been
a&s;&s;igned; <HI>Dragut Rais,</HI> inflamed
with rage, would not lo&s;e the
opportunity of engaging me.&mdash;
He knew my galley, and &s;ur|rounded
it; notwith&s;tanding the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance I received from a <HI>Ve|netian</HI>
ve&s;&s;el, I was &s;o hemmed
in by the enemy, that re&s;i&s;tance
was in vain; covered with wounds
I fell into the &s;ea not unob&s;erved
by <HI>Dragut-Rais,</HI> who gave or|ders
to &s;natch me from in&s;tant
death, only to exerci&s;e his ven|geance
in a thou&s;and &s;hapes for
depriving him of his brother:
he kept me chained at the bot|tom
of the &s;hip, where I endured
more than humanity can con|ceive.</P>
<P>DEAF to all remon&s;trances,
and petitions, he would never
con&s;ent that I &s;hould try to pro|cure
<PB N="183" REF="185">
a ran&s;om, four years were
already pa&s;&s;ed, when after a warm
conte&s;t, he obliged an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
&s;hip to &s;trike: all my &s;orrows
were renewed, when I &s;aw my
countrymen as unfortunate as
my&s;elf. I enquired news from
<HI>England,</HI> and particularly if they
could give me any intelligence of
Lady <HI>Warwick?</HI> Among&s;t the
pri&s;oners was a gentleman, whom
&s;he had taken into her &s;ervice af|ter
our &s;eparation, and who re|mained
in it till her death.&mdash;
A death ever fatal to my repo&s;e,
and which I bewail with uncea&s;|ing
tears.</P>
<P>The earl, &s;uffocated with grief,
was a long time before he could
re&s;ume his &s;tory; at length, re|covering
from the di&s;order this
painful narration had thrown
him into, he proceeded: I&mdash;
<PB N="184" REF="186">
learned from this man, that my
wife, hearing the report of my
death, which &s;he too ea&s;ily be|lieved,
was &s;o affected &s;he &s;unk
under the blow, &s;urviving it only
a few days. This cruel recital
was followed by that of my child's
death, that dear infant! The
only attachement I had to life
after the lo&s;s of her mother.&mdash;
This was the completion of my
woes. I no longer felt the hard|&s;hip
of captivity.&mdash;I became in|&s;en&s;ible
to all the mortifications
the <HI>Cor&s;air</HI> could impo&s;e.&mdash;His
peculiar plea&s;ure was to keep my
apprehen&s;ions of the effects of
his anger always awake.&mdash;That
was now impo&s;&s;ible;&mdash;for my
indifference to good or bad for|tune
was &s;o perfect, that the
&s;weete&s;t con&s;olation I had, was
to remain in a damp dungeon
loaded with irons, and &s;till more
<PB N="185" REF="187">
with mi&s;ery; expecting the le|nient
hand of death to clo&s;e my
eyes. How &s;evere were my re|proaches
for leaving my wife and
daughter! If thy goodne&s;s, O
my <HI>God!</HI> had &s;pared but one,
there would be a ray of hope to
&s;upport me! Alas! I have lo&s;t
all! without being ranked a|mong&s;t
the living, I am a wretch
not yet numbered with the
dead!</P>
<P>IT would be tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing on
your patience to dwell any longer
on the recital of my &s;ufferings.
Let it &s;uffice that at the expira|tion
of eight years, of horrible
impri&s;onment, <HI>Dragut Rais</HI> one
day remembered me.&mdash;For I
am convinced he had for &s;ome
time totally forgot I exi&s;ted.&mdash;
He commanded me to be re|lea&s;ed
from my dungeon; and
<PB N="186" REF="188">
when I breathed the fre&s;h air,
and &s;aw the light of day, I faint|ed.
Come, come, <HI>Warwick,</HI>
&s;aid he, re&s;ume thy courage. I
have determined to re&s;tore your
&s;word; but it is on condition thou
&s;weare&s;t by the oath &s;acred to
<HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> to u&s;e it in my de|fence,
again&s;t all tho&s;e I &s;hall at|tack.
without choice or exception
of per&s;ons or nations? If thou
wilt con&s;ent, &s;aid he, pre&s;enting
me his hand, thou &s;halt not be
le&s;s honoured than my&s;elf.&mdash;
Thou &s;halt &s;hare my command,
&mdash;and divide my fortune.&mdash;As a
proof, I will adopt thee by my
favourite name, <HI>Muley,</HI> and pre|&s;ent
thee with a robe like my
own? The offers you make are
not &s;ufficient to tempt me, I re|plied;
your riches I de&s;pi&s;e;&mdash;
and the equality of command,
you rank &s;o high, is below my
<PB N="187" REF="189">
acceptance! But if the &s;ervices
my &s;word can render may pur|cha&s;e
liberty, tell me in what
time you will grant it; and what
ran&s;om you demand? It &s;hall
co&s;t thee &s;ix thou&s;and crowns at
the end of ten years, during
which period thou &s;halt &s;erve me
with fidelity. I agreed to his
propo&s;al, which mu&s;t excu&s;e my
behaviour in the late action. My
honour was pledged, and I could
not di&s;pen&s;e with the obligation;
though my ardent wi&s;hes were
in your favour. But <HI>Heaven</HI> in|&s;pired
you with courage;&mdash;you
forced <HI>Dragut-Rais</HI> to fly,&mdash;and
have abridged the period of my
captivity. I judged it imprudent
to di&s;cover my&s;elf, as a wrong
interpretation might be given to
my being found in arms again&s;t
my country. The opinion I
have of the goodne&s;s of your
<PB N="188" REF="190">
heart, a&s;&s;ures me you will an&s;wer
my expectations by making a
proper u&s;e of the &s;ecret I entru&s;t
you with.</P>
<P>I ESTEEM it a &s;ingular hap|pine&s;s,
replied <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> that
without being intimately known
to you, I am thought worthy
of your confidence; a mark
of e&s;teem&punc; which I will ne|ver
abu&s;e; and I have the &s;atis|faction
to a&s;&s;ure you, my dear &s;ir,
you could not have be&s;towed it
on any per&s;on who has it more
in their power as well as incli|nation
to repay the favour, by
informing you of joyfull and &s;ur|prizing
events in which you are
extremely concerned.</P>
<P>HE then gave him a faithfull
relation of all that regarded the
lovely <HI>Julia;</HI> and though he did
<PB N="189" REF="191">
not declare his love, the pa&s;&s;ion|ate
turn of his expre&s;&s;ions, the
portrait he drew of her charms,
and the earl's recollection of the
deep &s;ighs and exclamations he
had heard in the night, were e|vident
proofs to him, that <HI>Hyp|politus</HI>
adored his daughter.</P>
