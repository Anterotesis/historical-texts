<P>HAVING met with a few &s;portive &s;allies on &s;ubjects of national Satire, we have here thrown them together, not doubting but every liberal and in|genuous Mind will con&s;ider them as mere creatures of fancy, and not be influenced a moment to form a &s;e|rious opinion of the People, who are the &s;ubjects of them, from the&s;e Caricatures, where every feature is di&s;torted, and every blemi&s;h aggravated. On the con|trary, he will con&s;ider the&s;e as profe&s;&s;ed mi&s;repre&s;enta|tions, where no part of the &s;ubject is brought into view, but &s;uch as may produce burle&s;que, and excite ridicule. Under this qualification they may be &s;afely laughed at, and we may be entertained with the wit or humour of the writers, without adopting their pre|judices, or being influenced by their invectives.</P>

<P>From the di&s;&s;olute turn of this poem, and the &s;arca&s;m $ Republics, one can hardly believe that it was written by the famous republican Henry Neville, who had been one $ the Members of the Long Parliament, and was afterwards con|cerned with Harrington in his Rota Scheme. Yet Anthony Wood-cla&s;&s;es him with the noted Oliverian banterer Harry Marten, and mentions other pieces of drollery by Henry Neville, who lived to the year 1694, when he died in Lon|don, aged 74. Nor, be&s;ides him, do we recollect any other poet of the name of Neville, or Nevell, during the reign of K. Charles II. when this piece was evidently written.</P></NOTE></L>

<HEAD>A SATIRE ON THE ORIGIN OF THE ENGLISH NATION IN THE ANCIENT SCOTTISH DIALECT <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As we have in&s;erted below a poetical attack on our fellow-citizens beyond the Tweed by one of our Southern bards; it is but fair to confront it with &s;ome &s;atirical reflections on the vanity of our own countrymen, by an ancient Scotti&s;h Satiri&s;t.

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This is extracted from the &s;ame MS. Collection as the foregoing, where it occurs in p. 162, b. &mdash;. It is there in|tituled,
<Q>HOW THE FIRST HELAND-MAN, OF 'JOVE' WAS MAID OF A HORSS-TURD IN ARGYLE, AS IS SAID.</Q>
In the original the Interlocutors are "God and St. Peter;" which, being &s;hockingly profane, have been every where al|tered, as in the text. But the original &s;hews the licentious &s;pirit of the times, when it was written.</P>
<P>The Highlanders of old, like the ancient Heroes of Greece, con&s;idered their Depredations on their more laborious Neigh|bours, as legitimate warlike &s;poils: and their Bards, no doubt, would with equal &s;arca&s;ms, retort on the Lowlanders their da&s;tardly &s;pirit in being more addicted to agriculture, and the &s;ofter arts of peace, than them&s;elves. This Character of &s;ome of the Highland Clans, and their fondne&s;s for plunder, is &s;aid to have continued down to our times; for the celebrated Laird of Lochiel, when he mu&s;tered his People before the young Pretender in 1745, is reported to have a&s;&s;ured him, That his Clan &s;hould fight, or rob, with any in the world.</P>
<P>Happily the &s;ame high &s;pirit, accompanied with ju&s;$e$ notions, has converted the&s;e little ho&s;tile independent tribes into hone&s;t and worthy &s;ubjects, who have afforded generous &s;oldiers for our defence, and from being the di&s;turbers have become the valiant protectors of the Briti&s;h Empire.</P></NOTE>

<P>We &s;hall now g$ve &s;ome account of the author.</P>
<P>JOHN CLEIVELAND was &s;on of the Rev. Thomas Cleiv$|land, M. A. Vicar of Hinckley and Rector of Stoke in L$|ce&s;ter&s;hire; who, with many of his Children, was a &s;ufferer for the C$$&s;e of K. Charles I. H$s elde&s;t &s;on John was born at Loughborough in the &s;aid county, as appears from the Regi&s;ter of that pari&s;h, where his bapti&s;m is entered June 2$, 1613. Having been educated at Hinckley under the Rev. Richard Vines, (who was afterwards a celebrated preacher of the Pre&s;byterian party) he was admitted of Chri&s;t's College, in Cambridge, September 4, 1627, and took the degree of B. A. in 1631. He thence removed to St. John's College in the &s;ame Univer&s;ity, being elected Fellow, March 27, 1634, and became M. A. the following year, 1635. He continued for many years the delight and orname$t of that hou&s;e, in which he was one of the Tutors, and, being excu&s;ed from going into Holy orders, became their Rhetoric Reader, and was u&s;ually employed to draw up all Epi&s;tles and Addre&s;&s;es for that Society, being much admired for the purity and ter&s;ene&s;s of his Latin &s;tyle. He al&s;o became celebrated for his occa|&s;ional Poems in Engli&s;h, e&s;pecially on the breaking-out of the civil wars, when he is &s;aid to have been the fir&s;t champion that appeared in ver&s;e for the royal cau&s;e <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Word's Athen. Oxon. <HI>2</HI>d Ed. II. f. <HI>274.</HI></NOTE>. Afterwards, when the oppo&s;ite party prevailed, he retired to the king at Oxford, and was in his ab&s;ence ejected from his Fellow&s;hip; April 8, 1644<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Walker's Sufferings, &amp;c. pt.

After the &s;urrender of the Garri&s;on in 1646, by the expre&s;s command of the King, the a Pri&s;oner with the Scotti&s;h Army, Cleiveland followed t$ fates of di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Loyalty, living up and down concealed f$ &s;ome years, till in November, 1655, he was &s;eized at Nor|wich, as a per&s;on of great abilities, adver&s;e and dangerous t$ the reigning government <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Thurlow's State Papers, Vol. IV. p. <HI>185.</HI></NOTE>, and was thence removed to Yar|mouth; where he lay many months in pri&s;on, till addre&s;&s;ing a petition to the Protector, he was by his order &s;et at liberty. This Petition (printed in his Works) is remarkable for the addre&s;s with which the writer employs &s;uch moving topics as might neither do violence to his Con&s;cience, nor betray his Cau&s;e, and yet be effectual to procure his enlargement. At length removing to Gray's Inn, London, he was there &s;eized with an epidemical intermitting Fever, of which he died on Thur&s;|day morning, April 29, 1658, in his chamber in Gray's Inn, whence his body was brought to Hun&s;don Hou&s;e, and on Sa|turday May 1, was interred in the pari&s;h church of St. Mi|chael on College Hill, London<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fuller's Worthies in Leice&s;ter&s;hire.</NOTE>: his remains receiving the la&s;t honours, by the attendance of many per&s;ons eminent for their loyalty and learning, to whom his Funeral Sermon was preached by his intimate friend, the eminent Dr. Pear&s;on, afterwards Bi&s;hop of Che&s;ter, and author of the celebrated Expo&s;ition of the Creed <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dav.

In 1646, (during his &s;hort re&s;idence at Cambridge) being then but 19 years of age, he publi&s;hed his "Horae Vacivae, or E&s;&s;ayes," a &s;uf|ficient proof of his abilities. His poems came out the &s;ame year. He publi&s;hed the fir&s;t Engli&s;h ver&s;ion of Longinus, which he intituled "The Height of Eloquence, Lond. 1652," 8vo. This he tran&s;lated from the Greek, as he al&s;o did "Hie|rocles upon the Golden Ver&s;es of Pythagoras;" before which is an account of the ingenious tran&s;lator and his works, by John Davis of Kidwelly, by whom it was publi&s;hed in 1657, 8vo. More of him and his writings may be &s;een in Wood's Athen. Oxon. 2d Ed. Vol. I. p. 534. The poems here re|printed are taken from a little volume (thus intituled, "Po|ems by John Hall, Cambridge, printed by Roger Daniel, Printer to the Univer&s;itie, 1646, for J.

<HEAD>A POETICAL PARLEY WITH A THREADBARE CLOAK.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY THOMAS JORDAN <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Jordan was a performer belonging to the company at the Red Bull, and acted the part of Lepida in the tragedy of Me&s;&s;alina. He had the honour of reciting before King Charles the Fir&s;t a poem of his own, "at the Dedication of Mr. Tho. Bu&s;hel's Rock at Eu&s;ton in Oxon, 1638, in the per&s;on of Calliope;" and was one of the few players and poets who lived to &s;ee the Re&s;toration. In 1657 he publi&s;hed a co|medy, intituled, "The Walks of I&s;lington and Hog&s;don, with the Humours of Wood&s;treet Compter," and a Ma&s;que called "Fancy's Fe&s;tivals." He was al&s;o author of a vo|lume, called "Wit in a Wilderne&s;&s;e of promi&s;cuous Poe&s;ie," addre&s;&s;ed, "To the liberall Lover, charitable Cheri&s;her, and pious Pre&s;erver of Indu&s;try, Hone&s;ty, cha&s;te Ingenuity, Science and Civility, the much honored George Lord Bi&s;hop of St. A&s;haph." This volume is undated; but mu&s;t have been publi&s;hed between 1660 and 1667, while Bp. Griffith filled the &s;ee of St. A&s;aph. In 1668 he publi&s;hed "Mo|ney is an A&s;s," a comedy. On the death of John Tatham Mr. Jordan became poet to the city of London, and regularly compo&s;ed their pageants from the year 1671 to 1684, when it may be pre&s;umed, he died, and was &s;ucceeded by Taubman. Another dramatic production by Mr. Jordan, called "Love hath found out his Eyes," was once in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mr. Warburton the Herald, but de&s;troyed by the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s o$ a &s;ervant. In the little volume of Jordan's poems are &s;everal to and from "his much honored Friend, Hen. Stone&s;treet, Gent. on London Bridge," the &s;ame, probably, who&s;e poems are in my fifth volume, p. 73&mdash;81. There is al&s;o "an Epi|taph on Thomas Milward, Gent. who&s;e face (by general con|ception) was very like that of K. Charles the Fir&s;t;" and a very good one on Sir Nath. Brent. $nt. LL. D. who died in 1653. Jordan's "Encomium on R$d No&s;es" has much hu|mourous merit. N.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>

&mdash;Of this work the following account is given by M. Camu&s;at, in his
<Q>&startq;Critical Hi&s;tory of Journals:&endq;</Q>
<Q>&startq;Peu de livres ont eu le $ucc&egrave;s du 'Chef d'Oeuvre d'un Inconna.' La Preface de la premiere &eacute;dition nous &s;$it comprendre que le commentaire du 'Chef d'Oeuvre' e&s;t imit&eacute; d'apr&egrave;s cette va&s;te compilation de notes qui fit naitre en 1712 le 'Pervigilium Veneris' &s;ous la forme d'un gr$s 'Variorum,' &agrave; la Haye chez Scheurler. Le 'Pervigilium' e&s;t une piece &agrave; la verit&eacute; plus importante que la chan&s;on de 'Catin Catos:' mais il falloit repandre le ridicule &s;ur une compilation o&ugrave; l'on trou|voit beaucoup d' $utilit&eacute;s. Peu de per&s;onnes &s;avent que le plan de commentaire de Ma&icirc;tre Matana&s;e &s;ur le 'Chef d'Oeuvre' &s;e fit &agrave; table au commencement de l'ann&eacute;e 1714, ent$e cinq ou &s;ix amis, qui la plupart travailloient alors au premier Journal Literaire. M. Themi&s;euil fut charg&eacute; de l'execution, et re&uuml;&s;&s;it admirablement. Ce que je viens de raporter peut expliquer ce qu'a dit l'Auteur de l' 'Etat de l'homme' dans le pech&eacute; originel.' Cet Auteur a cru de&s;ho|norer le 'Chef d'Oeuvre' en di&s;ant, 'que ce n'&eacute;toit qu'un fruit de vint et quatre heures con&ccedil;u &agrave; table entre la poire et le fromage.' Un tel m&eacute;pris ne &s;ert qu'&agrave; mieux faire l'&eacute;loge de ce 'Chef d'Oeuvre', et de &s;on Auteur.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Je dois remarquer encore &agrave; l'occa&s;ion du 'Chef d'Oeuvre' que le 'Spectateur' Anglois a tach&eacute; de l'imiter par une chan&s;on qu'il &s;uppo&s;e deterr&eacute;e dans quelque ancien Manu|&s;cript, et qu'll accompagne de notes qui con&s;i&s;tent unique|ment en ces le&ccedil;ons connues chez les &s;avans &s;ous le nom de 'Variantes.' Vois 'Spectateur,' tom. V. 15 di&s;cours. Mais quelle diff&eacute;rence entre l' imitation et l' original! La chan&s;on et le commentaire de l'Anglois n'ont rien d'agre|able et de piquant; et le froid de l'original e&s;t fidellement con&s;erv&eacute; dans la traduction qu'on nous a donn&eacute;c du 'Spec|tateur.' Hi&s;toire Critique des Journaux, tom. II. p. 152. n. 1. A Am&s;terdam, 1734.&endq;</Q>
&mdash; The Engli&s;h reader will reflect that the writer is a Frenchman; and that a French|man has no idea of the <HI>d$y</HI> Engli&s;h humour, in which Ad|d$&s;on (for "The Critique" referred to is his) &s;o eminently excelled.&mdash;For the communication of the&s;e remarks, and the poem which gave ri&s;e to them (which I had barely mentioned in vol.

I doubt not but it will prove a plea&s;ing amu&s;ement to the curious reader, to trace the fir&s;t dawnings of genius in &s;ome of our fir&s;t-rate poetic characters; and to compare them with the eminence they afterwards attained to, and the rank they at la&s;t held among their brethren of the laurel. Some early &s;pecimens of Dryden's genius have already been given, vol. I. p. 181; and vol. II. p. 90. Tho&s;e of Cow|ley, here printed, abound with &s;trokes of wit, &s;ome true, but the far greater part fal&s;e; which thoroughly characteri&s;e the wr$ter, and may be ju&s;tly pronounced to point out his genius and manner, in miniature. K. &mdash; This &s;pecies of entertain|ment the kind attention of Mr. Kyna&s;ton (the friend to whom I owe the&s;e remarks) enables me con&s;iderably to extend, by furni&s;hing the earlie&s;t poetical productions of &s;ome writers who are now univer&s;ally looked up to as excellent; none of which are to be found in any edition of their re&s;pective works. In &s;uch juvenile performances, it is well ob&s;erved by an ad|m$rable critic,

<HEAD>ON THE MARRIAGE OF GEORGE PRINCE OF DENMARK, AND THE LADY ANNE <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From the "Hymenaeus Cantabrigien&s;is. Cantabrigiae, 1683." This copy, notwith&s;tanding the &s;ignature, is beyond a doubt the property of the facetious MATT Prior. &mdash; Hear my rea&s;ons. &mdash; It appears from a copy of Prior's admi&s;&s;ion, printed in the "Gentleman's Magazine" for 1779, p. 640, that Prior was admitted of Saint John's in Cambridge, April 2, 1683; and on the 3d of that month was appointed a SCHOLAR of the hou&s;e, on the Dutche&s;s of Somer&s;et's foun|dation, by her Grace's own nomination. &mdash; Now this year 1683 is the year of the Publication of the Cambridge Ver&s;es on the Marriage of the Prince of Denmark.&mdash;PRIOR's copy has the &s;ignature of a SCHOLAR of St. John's College. The rea&s;on of the mi&s;take in the <HI>chri&s;tian</HI> name I take to be this. &mdash; All our College Exerci&s;es are given up, &s;igned only, by US, with our SURNAME. &mdash; The Dean of the College, to whom, in right of his office, Prior's Ver&s;es were delivered, not knowing, or mi&s;taking Prior's name, who was then a Fre&s;hman, marked them with A. in&s;tead of M. when he gave them in to the UNIVERSITY INSPECTORS for their appro|bation: or, probably, he might have made &s;o aukward an M. that THEY MISTOOK it for an A. &mdash; For the Ver&s;es them&s;elves, I have not, as I before ob&s;erved, the lea&s;t doubt but they are HONEST MATT's: and hope you will re&s;tore them to him. &mdash; They bear INTERNAL evidence of their being written by one, though a Fre&s;hman, <HI>u&s;ed</HI> to <HI>write Latin Ver&s;e</HI>; and to write it too, in a <HI>Great School</HI>, under a Great Ma&s;ter &mdash;as was Prior's&mdash;Dr. Bo&s;by. There is a cla&s;&s;ical ter&s;ene&s;s on the diction; and ea&s;e, and harmony in the Numbers. And the di&s;tant imitation of Martial's admirable lines on the HAPPY MARRIED PAIR &mdash; or rather the ALLUSION to that excellent little piece (for it can hardly be called a$ IMITATION of it) &s;hews the TASTE of a MASTER, a the YEARS of a BOY, and is not unworthy the NAME or the FAME of PRIOR.

From thence he removed to Pembroke H$ll, Cambridge, of which he became a &s;cholar, and afterwards to Peter Hou&s;e, where he was cho&s;en a fellow. At this place, as in the former, he was di&s;tingui&s;hed for his Latin and Eng|li&s;h poetry. He took the degree of Ma&s;ter of Arts; but being &s;oon after ejected from his fellow&s;hip for denying the cove|nant, during the time of the civil wars, he was reduced to great indigence. At length he took the re&s;olution of going beyond &s;ea, and changed his religion, but without obtaining any advantage from it, as in 1646 he was di&s;covered at Paris in a mi&s;erable condition by Cowley, who recommended him to Queen Henrietta, and by her means he obtained letters of recommendation to &s;everal per&s;ons in Italy, whither he &s;oon went. On his arrival at Rome he became &s;ecretary to a car|dinal there, and in the end one of the canons or chaplains of the church of Loretto, where he died in 1650.

&mdash;The uncommon excellence of Edmund Smith's productions mu&s;t en&s;ure them a favourable reception; e&s;pecially when it is con&s;idered that at the time of their com|po&s;ition he was only one remove from a &s;chool-boy. Had Dr. John&s;on &s;een the fir&s;t of the&s;e publications, he would not have been at a lo&s;s to determine, in the excellent life he has given the world of Smith, whether the latter was admitted in the univer&s;ity in the year 1689, as he would thence have been enabled to pronounce with certainty that he was in 1688 a Member of Chri&s;t Church. I take this to have been the year of Smith's admi&s;&s;ion; and that he was then ju&s;t come off from We&s;t|min&s;ter, in time to &s;ignali&s;e his abilities by writing on the Birth of the Prince of Wales, when a FRESHMAN (according to the univer&s;ity phra&s;e) and before he was appointed to a Stu|dent&s;hip; for his name is &s;ub&s;cribed to that Copy of Ver&s;es, with the addition of COMMONER. The great &s;uperiority of genius that is di&s;played in this fir&s;t &mdash; School-boy's&mdash;produc|tion of Smith, beyond what Addi&s;on has di&s;covered in his fir&s;t performance &mdash; the Pa&s;toral on the Inauguration of King William and Queen Mary &mdash; &s;ufficiently &s;erves to account for Smith's being, as Dr. John&s;on ob&s;erves,
<Q>&startq;one of the murmurers at fortune; and wondering, why he was &s;uf|fered to be poor, when Addi&s;on was care&s;&s;ed and pre|&endq;ferred.</Q>
Smith could not but be con&s;cious of the greater degree of literary merit he him&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed even in the very department to which Addi&s;on owed the earlier part of his f$me, THE WRITING OF LATIN VERSE; &mdash; and on com|paring their juvenile performances, it is evident that Smith had rea&s;on enough for that con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s.&mdash;Addi&s;on fir&s;t re|commended him&s;elf to notice by his dedication of the <HI>Ma&s;ae Anglicanae</HI> to Lord Halifax, and by the poems of his own therein in&s;erted. But what are HIS poems in compari&s;on of SMITH'S? See the note in vol. IV. p. 62. K.</NOTE>.</HEAD>

This poem is pre&s;erved, not only on account of its own merit (a very few languid, unpoetical lines excepted); but as it is, I pre&s;ume, no where to be met with, except in the Collection from which it is here tran&s;cribed.

<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dr. Jo&s;eph Trapp, born at Cherington in Glouce&s;ter|&s;hire, in 1669, was educated at Wadham College, where he took the degree of M. A. May 13, 1702. In 1708 he was cho&s;en the fir&s;t profe&s;&s;or of poetry, &s;oon after the foundation of that profe&s;&s;or&s;hip by Dr. Birkhead, and publi&s;hed his lec|tures under the title of "Praelectiones Poeticae;" the fir&s;t vo|lume of which is dedicated to Mr. Secretary St. John; to who&s;e father, in the early part of his life, he had been chap|lain. His church preferments were, the rectory of Harlington in Middle&s;ex, of Chri&s;t-church in Newgate-&s;treet, and St. Leonard, Fo&s;terlane; with the Lecture&s;hips of St. Lawrence Jewry, and St. Martin in the Fields. He was created D. D. by diploma, Feb. 1, 1727; was long e&s;teemed as an agreeable and pathetic preacher; and died Nov. 22, 1747. Four vo|lumes of his Sermons are in print; as are his controver&s;ial treati&s;es again&s;t the Papi&s;ts and Methodi&s;ts, which have much merit. He publi&s;hed a tran&s;lation of Virgil, in blank ver&s;e, in$fferently executed; and another of "Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t" in Lati$, &s;till wor&s;e. He was al&s;o the author of "Abramule," a tragedy, in 1704: and of &s;everal occa&s;ional Mi&s;cellanies. He was chaplain to the lord chancellor of Ireland in 1711; and pub|li&s;hed in that year "A Character of the pre&s;ent Set of Whigs;" which Swift, who conveyed it to the printer, calls "a very &s;$urvy piece;" &s;ee the Journal to Stella, May 14, 1711. In a &s;hort time after, he printed at Dublin a poem on the duke of Ormond, which was re-printed at London, "and the printer &s;old ju&s;t eleven of them:" &s;ee Journal, Aug. 24, 1711. Having mentioned to Stella, that Trapp and Sacheverell had been to vi&s;it him; Swift adds, "Trapp is a coxcomb, and the other is not very deep; and their judgement in things of wit and &s;en&s;e is miraculous." Journal, March 17, 1711-12.</NOTE>

<BYLINE>BY: DR. GEORGE SEWELL <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This gentleman, who was univer&s;ally e&s;teemed for his amiable di&s;po&s;ition, is better known as an elegant writer and an excellent poet than in his own profe&s;&s;ion. He was born at Wind&s;or, where his father was trea&s;urer and chapter-clerk of the college. He received his education at Eton-&s;chool, and at Peter-hou&s;e, Cambridge; where having taken the de|gree of B. M. he went to Leyden, to &s;tudy under Boerhaave, and on his return practi&s;ed phy&s;ic in the metropolis with re|putation. In the latter part of life he retired to Hamp&s;tead, where he pur&s;ued his profe&s;&s;ion with &s;ome degree of &s;ucce&s;s untill three other phy&s;icians came to &s;ettle at the &s;ame place, when his practice &s;o far declined as to yield him very little advantage. He kept no hou&s;e, but was a boarder. He was much e&s;teemed, and &s;o frequently invited to the tables of gentlemen in the neighbourhood, that he had &s;eldom occa|&s;ion to dine at home. He died the 8th of February, 1726; and was &s;uppo&s;ed to be very indigent at the time of his death, as he was interred on the 12th of the &s;ame month in the meane&s;t manner, his coffin being little better than tho&s;e al|lotted by the pari&s;h to the poor who are buried from the workhou&s;e; neither did a &s;ingle friend or relation attend him to the grave. No memorial was placed over his remains: but they lie ju&s;t under a hollow tree which formed a part of a hedge-row that was once the boundary of the church yard. Be&s;ides &s;even controver&s;ial pampblets, he wrote, 1.

and a c$llection of
<Q>&startq;Se|veral Poems publi&s;hed in his life-time.&endq;</Q>
The follow$g &s;ingle poems of his are enumerated by $word$ and Cibber (by both of whom tho&s;e here &s;elected are unnoticed): 1.

ADDISON <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The author of this &s;ketch wanted no inclination, and was prompted by many rea&s;ons to pay his little tribute to the a&s;hes of that excellent man; but &s;eeing another poem on the &s;ame &s;ubject [by Mr. Tickell, probably,] he left it unfini&s;hed; and it now comes forth, rather as a te&s;timony of his grati|tude and e&s;teem, than as a de&s;ign equal to the merit of the decea&s;ed. The reader will &s;ee ea&s;ily that the &s;cheme is at lea&s;t new to an Engli&s;h ta&s;te, and what a &s;cope there was to have given it length, if not worth &s;ufficient. The An|cients delighted much in this &s;olemn kind of poetry; and indeed if we &s;peak with a true warmth of affection, it &s;eems the mo&s;t natural and be&s;t &s;ort of Elegy. If the reader has a mind to &s;ee a noble &s;pecimen of this way of writing, let him read the great Dr. Bentley's "Allocutio ad Sepulchrum, on the Death of Prince George," which is by far the mo&s;t excellent and fini&s;hed piece of this &s;ort that ever was pro|duced.

<HEAD>TO HENRY WRIGHT, OF MOBBERLEY, ESQ. ON BUYING THE PICTURE OF F. MALEBRANCHE,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY JOHN BYROM <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This ingenious poet, a younger &s;on of Mr. Edward By|rom, of Ker&s;all in Lanca&s;hire, was born in Manche&s;ter, 1601. He was educated, fir&s;t in his native town, and after|wards at Merchant Taylors &s;chool in London, whence he was admitted a pen&s;ioner of Trinity College, Cambridge, under the famous Mr. Baker, July 6, 1708. He fir&s;t di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him&s;elf in the world of letters in 1714 by the cele|brated pa&s;toral, "My time, O ye Mu&s;es, was happily &s;pent," in the eighth volume of "The Spectator," and by two hu|morous letters on dreams in that volume. In the &s;ame year 1714, being then B. A. and having by his genius and regularity attracted the particular notice of Dr. Bentley, he was elected fellow of his college. Not chu&s;ing to enter into orders, he vacated his fellow&s;hip in 1716, and went to Montpellier; where, applying him&s;elf clo&s;ely to the &s;tudy of phy&s;ic, he acquired the appellation of Doctor. On his return to London, he became violently enamoured with a lady who was the &s;econd daughter of a rich uncle, which terminated in a match &s;o di&s;agreeable to their relations that they were reduced to great nece&s;&s;ity. The Doctor, however, had re|cour&s;e to an invention he had made whil&s;t at Cambridge, of a curious method of writing &s;hort-hand; and, by pa&s;&s;ing the winter &s;ea&s;on in London, and the &s;ummer at Manche&s;ter, ob|tained from it a tolerable &s;upport for an increa&s;ing family. By the death of an elder brother the family e&s;tate devolved to him; and the bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;hort-hand being no longer nece&s;&s;ary, he retired to a dome&s;tic life, and indulged him&s;elf in baga|telles till his death, which happened at Manche&s;ter, in the &s;eventy-&s;econd year of his age, Sept 26, 1763. Two volumes of his poetical productions were publi&s;hed at Manche&s;ter, in 1773, 8vo. By the&s;e he appears to have been a Behmeni&s;t. As it was his manner to commit his &s;entiments of every kind to ver&s;e; he is the author of many poems on &s;ubjects on which no one but him&s;elf would ever have invoked the Mu&s;es. His lighter ver&s;es he committed to the flames, and among them probably &s;ome of his be&s;t, if we may judge from this and his "Pa&s;toral Ballad," compared with his
<Q>&startq;two vo|lumes.&endq;</Q>
One of his Poetical Di&s;&s;ertations is made famous by Mr. Pegge's animadver&s;ions on it in the fifth volume of the "Archaeologia." N.</NOTE>, M. A. F. R. S. NOT PRINTED IN HIS WORKS.</BYLINE>

<HEAD>TO PEREGRINE MARQUIS OF CARMARTHEN, ON HIS MARRIAGE WITH THE LADY ANNE SEYMOUR. 1719.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. THOMAS NEWCOMB <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of this ingenious writer I have given &s;ome particulars in vol. IV. p. 356. I &s;ince find that he lived &s;ome time at Hackney in rather di&s;tre&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances; but was no re|lation to the Newcomes that keep the famous &s;chool there. Dr. Young was his friend. Be&s;ides the &s;everal poems I have $ere pre&s;erved, the long poem on the La&s;t Judgement, and $o&s;e I have before pointed out, he wrote, 1.
<Q>&startq;The Manners of the Times, in &s;even Satires,&endq;</Q>
after Dr. Young had publi&s;hed his Satires; 2. "An Ode to the Queen, on the happy Acce&s;&s;ion of their Maje&s;ties, to the Crown, 1727:" 3. "An Ode to the Right Honourable the Earl of Orford, on Retirement, 1742;" 4. "A Collection of Odes and Epigrams, &amp;c. occa&s;ioned by the Succe&s;s of the Briti&s;h and Con&s;ederate Arms in Germany, 1743;" 5. "An Ode in&s;cribed to the Memory of the late Earl of Orford, 1747;" 6. "Two Odes to his Royal Highne&s;s the Duke of Cum|berland; on his Return from Scotland, and on his Voy|age to Holland, 1746;" 7. "A Paraphra&s;e on &s;ome Select P&s;alms;" 8. "The Con&s;ummation, a Sacred Ode on the fi|nal Di&s;&s;olution of the World, in&s;cribed to his Grace the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, 1752;" 4to. 9. "Vindicta Bri|tannica, an Ode on the Royal Navy, in&s;cribed to the King, 1759;" 4to, 10. "Novus Epigrammatum Delectus, or Original State Epigrams and minor Odes &s;uited to the Times, 1760;" 8vo. 11. "The Retired Penitent. Being a poetical Ver&s;ion of one of the Rev. Dr. Young's moral Contempla|tions. Revi&s;ed, approved, and publi&s;hed, with the con&s;ent of that learned and eminent writer, 1760;" 12mo. 12. "A congratulatory Ode to the Queen, on her Voyage to England, 1761;" 4to. 13. "On the Succe&s;s of the Briti&s;h Arms. A congratulatory Ode addre&s;&s;ed to his Maje&s;ty, 1763;" 4to. [He was about 90 years old at this time.] 14. "The Death of Abel, a &s;acred Poem written originally in the Ger|man language, attempted in the Style of Milton, 1763;" 12mo. 15. In 1757 he publi&s;hed

in Blank Ver&s;e;" and in 1764 the whole of them were printed in 2 vol. 12mo. I have al&s;o rea&s;on to think that he was the author of "A Supplement to a late excellent Poem, intituled, <HI>Are the&s;e Things &s;o?</HI> 1740;" and of "Praeexi&s;tence and Tran&s;migration; or the new Metamorpho&s;is, a Philo&s;ophical E&s;&s;ay on the Na|t$re and Progre&s;s of the Soul; a Poem, &s;omething between a Panegyric and a Satire, 1743."

<HEAD>A POEM, SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF EDMUND SHEFFIELD, DUKE OF BUCKINGHAMSHIRE, DUKE AND MARQUIS OF NORMANBY, EARL OF MULGRAVE, AND BARON OF BUTTERWICK.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY JOHN BOYLE <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">John Boyle, earl of Corke and Orrery, was the only &s;on of Charles the fourth earl of Orrery, of whom an account has already been given, vol. IV. p. 70. He was born the &s;econd of January, 1706-7, and was early put under the tuition of Mr. Fenton the poet, who in&s;tructed him from the age of &s;even to thirteen years. After pa&s;&s;ing through We&s;t|min&s;ter School, he was admitted as a nobleman of Chri&s;t Church, Oxford, and &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his poe|tical abilities. In 1732 he took his &s;eat in the Hou&s;e of Lords, and generally voted again&s;t the mini&s;try in the great national que&s;tions which were at that period agitating; but, not reli&s;hing the bu&s;tle of a public life, he &s;oon retreated from the bu&s;y world to the enjoyment of his friends, and the cul|tivation of letters. In this &s;tate he produced many agreeable and entertaining performances both in pro&s;e and ver&s;e, which will ever reflect credit on his abilities as a writer. He was twice married, and left children by each wife. On the third of December, 1753, he &s;ucceeded to the title of Corke, and died November 16, 1762, aged fifty-&s;ix years. His character, by Mr. Duncombe, is in&s;erted in the Biographia Britannica. R.</NOTE>, EARL OF ORRERY.</BYLINE>

<HEAD>A HASTY PROLOGUE TO ALL FOR LOVE <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am indebted for this <HI>unique</HI> of bi&s;hop Hoadly's compo|&s;ition to Mr. Duncombe's elegant publication of
<Q>&startq;Letters by &s;everal eminent Per&s;ons.&endq;</Q>
Both the poem and its hi&s;tory were communicated to Mr. Duncombe by the late Mr. Chan|cellor Hoadly, the Bi&s;hop's younge&s;t &s;on. N.</NOTE>, ACTED AT BLENHEIM-HOUSE IN THE SUMMER 1718<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In the &s;ummer of the year 1718, the bi&s;hop of Bangor, with Dr. Samuel Clarke, and Sir Richard Steele, made a vi&s;it of &s;ome days at Blenheim-hou&s;e, by invitation, where he found that the ladies and gentlemen of the family, and a few of the neighbourhood, had got up the tragedy of
<Q>&startq;All for Love,&endq;</Q>
to entertain the duke of Marlborough, who had &s;hewn, before this, &s;ome &s;ymptoms of that paralytic di&s;order which impaired his &s;en&s;es, and at length terminated in a total decay, and his di&s;&s;olution. Lady Bateman (one of his grace's grand-daughters by the earl of Sunderland), who $layed the part of Cleopatra, had in vain applied to Sir Richard Steele for a prologue on that extraordinary occa&s;ion, and &s;eemed chagrined at the di&s;appointment. At night, when the family retired, the bi&s;hop de&s;ired pen, ink, and paper, might be brought to his chamber, and, the next morn|ing, at breakfa&s;t, pre&s;ented to lady Bateman this prologue; which &s;he &s;poke, the &s;ame evening, to the duke and dutche&s;s, his grace &s;hedding tears at the unexpected compliment from a favourite grand-child. In the cour&s;e of the play, Sir Rich|ard, who &s;at next to the bi&s;hop, often ob&s;erved how well and feelingly captain Fi&s;he performed the part of Anthony. This gentleman, who had been the duke's page, had di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the army, and, as I have been informed, died a lieutenant-colonel. In one of the &s;cenes where Fi&s;he was very &s;weet upon his Cleopatra, Sir Richard whi&s;pered the bi&s;hop, "I doubt this <HI>Fi&s;he</HI> is <HI>Fle&s;h</HI>, my lord."&mdash;I mu&s;t men|tion another incident: at their going away, Sir Richard &s;aid to the bi&s;hop,
<Q>&startq;Does your lord&s;hip give money to all the&s;e fellows in laced coats and ruffles?&endq;</Q>
"No doubt," replied the bi&s;hop. "I have not enough," &s;aid the knight; and when he pa&s;&s;ed by them in the hall, he acco&s;ted them in a &s;peech, telling them,
<Q>&startq;that he had found them <HI>men of ta&s;te</HI>, and as &s;uch invited them all to Drury-lane theatre, to whatever play they &s;hould plea&s;e to be&s;peak,&endq;</Q>

<HEAD>AN IMITATION FROM THE SPECTATOR,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY ROBERT LLOYD <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Son of Dr. Pier&s;on Lloyd, &s;econd ma&s;ter of We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;chool, where, and at Trinity college, Cambridge, he di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him&s;elf by his poetical genuis, and al&s;o (&s;orry I am to add) by his irregularities. To the former we are indebted for his "Actor," and &s;everal other ingenious pieces. To the latter he owed his impri&s;onment in the Fleet, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure his immature death there, Dec. 15, 1764, though that was accelerated by the pang he felt for the lo&s;s of his friend Churchill, who&s;e genero&s;ity he had &s;o often experien|ced. D.&mdash;H$s character has been thus excellently pourtrayed by Mr. Wilkes:
<Q>&startq;He was mild and affable in private life, of gentle manners, and very engaging in conver&s;ation. He was an excellent &s;cholar, and an ea&s;y, natural poet. His peculiar excellence was the dre&s;&s;ing up an old thought in a new, neat, and trim manner. He was contented to &s;camper round the foot of Parna&s;&s;us on his little Welch poney, which &s;eems never to have tired. He left the fury of the winged &s;teed, and the daring heights of the mountain, to the &s;ublime genius of his friend Churchill.&endq;</Q>

<HEAD>ON SEEING THE PICTURE OF MISS HIGHMORE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of whom, &s;ee vol. VI. p. 103. N.</NOTE> AT MR. HIGHMORE'S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. (AFTERWARDS DR.) DODD <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This unfortunate author, elde&s;t &s;on of the Rev. W$. Dodd, M.A. many years vicar of Bourne in Lincoln&s;hire, was born May 29, 1729. He was &s;ent, at the age of 16, to the univer&s;ity of Cambridge, and admitted in the year 1745 a &s;zar of Clare-Hall. In 1749-50 he took the degree of B. A. with great honour, being upon that occa&s;ion placed in the li&s;t of wranglers. Leaving the univer&s;ity, he imprudently married a mi&s;s Mary Perkins, of Frith-&s;treet, Soho, in 1751; was or|dained a deacon the &s;ame year, and a prie&s;t in 1753, and &s;oon became a popular preacher. His fir&s;t preferment was the lecture&s;hip of We&s;t-Ham in 1752. In 1753 he was cho&s;en lecturer of St. James's Garlickhithe, which he re&s;igned in 1754 for that of St. Olave's Hart-&s;treet, and in 1758 took the degree of M. A. at Cambridge. On the foundation of the Magdalen Ho&s;pital in 1758, he was a &s;trenuous &s;upporter of that charity, and &s;oon after became preacher at the chapel of it. By the favour of bi&s;hop Squire, to whom he was chap|lain, he in 1763 obtained a prebend of Brecon, and by the &s;ame intere&s;t had the education of Mr. Stanhope, now earl of Ch$&s;terfield, entru&s;ted to his care. In 1765, by the intere&s;t of &s;ome city friends, he was appointed one of the king's chap|lains. In 1766 he went to Cambridge, and took the degree of LL. D. Two new polite chapels were now the &s;cenes of his mini&s;try, and he obtained the rectory of Hockcliffe in Bed|ford&s;hire by purcha&s;e. At this period the e&s;timation he was held in by the world was &s;ufficient to give him expectations of preferment, and hopes of riches and honours; and the&s;e he might probably have acquired, had $e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a common por|tion of prudence and di&s;cretion. On the $ving of St. George Hanover-&s;quare becoming vacant in 1774, he wrote an ano|nymous letter to the lord chancellor's lady, offering 3000 guineas if by her a&s;&s;i&s;tance he was promoted to it. This being traced to him, complaint was immediately made to the king; and Dr. Dodd was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with di&s;grace from his po&s;t of chaplain. From this period, though he obtained the vicarage of Winge in Bucks from his noble pupil, he lived neglected, if not de&s;pi&s;ed; and his extravagance &s;till continuing, he be|came involved in difficulties, which tempted him to for, $word$ Feb. 4, 1777, a bond from his late pupil lord Che&s;terfield for &pound;.4200. which he actually received; but, being detected was tried at the Old Bailey, found guilty, and, in &s;pite o$ every application for mercy, received &s;entence of death; and was executed at Tyburn, June 27, 1777. He was a volu+minous writer, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, with little judgment and muc$ vanity, con&s;iderable abilities: but the advantages of the$ were totally lo&s;t to him by habits of di&s;&s;ipation, which &s;e$ to have affected both his life and writings. A volume of h$ poetry appeared in 1767, 8vo. To this account, for whic$ I am principally indebted to a pamphlet called

<BYLINE>BY WALTER HARTE <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Son of the Rev. Walter Harte, who died at Kentbury in Bucks, Feb. 10, 1736, aged 85, and who had been fellow of Pembroke College, Oxford, pr$bend of Wells, and canon of Bri&s;tol, but re&s;igned at the Revolution. The &s;on fir&s;t di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him&s;elf by a volume of
<Q>&startq;Poems on &s;everal Occa&s;ions, 1727,&endq;</Q>
8vo. in&s;cribed to the earl of Peterborough, and written before he was nineteen. The&s;e were followed by his "E&s;&s;ay on Rea&s;on, 1727," folio, a very fine poem, which was much laboured, and went through Mr. Pope's hands. In a letter to Mr. Patti&s;on (printed in the Memoirs of that writer, prefixed to his Poems, 1728) Mr. Harte very frankly gives his &s;entiments on a projected new ver&s;ion of Ovid's Epi&s;tles, and &s;ays,
<Q>&startq;I have &s;tudied his manner much, and have often endeavoured to make a &s;ort of mixed writing from him and Statius.&endq;</Q>
He took the degree of M. A. January 20, 1730; and publi&s;hed that year
<Q>&startq;An E&s;&s;ay on Sa$ire, particularly the Dunciad,&endq;</Q>
8vo. He publi&s;hed al&s;o two Sermons, one called
<Q>&startq;The Union and Harmony of Rea&s;on, Morality, and Revealed Religion,&endq;</Q>
preached at St. Mary's Oxford, Feb. 27, 1736-7, which went through at lea&s;t five editions; the other, a Fa&s;t Sermon, preached at the &s;ame place, Jan. 9, 1739-40. He was afterwards vice-principal of St. Mary Hall, Oxford, a tutor of great repu|tation there; and was much patroni&s;ed by Mr. Pope and Mr. Lyttelton, who recommended him to Lord Che&s;terfield as a fit praece$tor to his natural &s;on Mr. Stanhope, with whom he travelled from 1746 till 1750. Mr. Harte is de&s;cri|bed by the noble lord as "a man of con&s;ummate erudition;" b$t was ill qualified to poli&s;h the manners of his pupil. He was awkward in his per&s;on and addre&s;s, had an unhappy im|pediment in his &s;peech, and a total want of ear; yet he &s;o well performed his office, that Lord Che&s;terfield rewarded him with a canonry of Wind&s;or,
<Q>&startq;procured with great diffi|culty;&endq;</Q>
a difficulty which certainly aro&s;e from his college connections; as St. Mary Hall, of which Dr. King was principal, was at that time noted for Jacobiti&s;m. The ma|terials of his "Hi&s;tory of Gu&s;tavus Adolphus, 1759," two volumes 4$o, are excellent; but he has marred his book by a &s;trange affected &s;tyle,
<Q>&startq;full of Latini&s;ms, Gallici&s;ms, Germanici&s;ms, and all <HI>i&s;ms</HI> but Anglici&s;ms.&endq;</Q>
He dedicated it to his patron, who &s;ays,
<Q>&startq;I was forced to prune the luxu|riant prai&s;es be&s;towed upon me, and yet have left enough to &s;atisfy a rea&s;onable man.&endq;</Q>
The &s;ucce&s;s of the hi&s;tory being unequal to his hopes, his health was &s;en&s;ibly affected by it. He publi&s;hed however an improved edition of it in 8vo. in 1763; but continued at Bath dejected and di&s;pirited, between real and imaginary di&s;tempers, till in November 1766 he had a &s;troke of the pal&s;y, which deprived him of the u&s;e of his right leg, affected his &s;peech, and in &s;ome degree his head.

<BYLINE>BY DR. SAMUEL CROXALL <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Son of Samuel Croxall, rector of Hanworth in Middle|&s;ex, and Vicar of Walton upon Thames in Surrey; in the la&s;t of which places our author was born. He received his early education at Eton &s;chool, and from thence was admitted into St. John's College, Cambridge, after which he entered into holy orders. Having a &s;trong attachment to the whig inte|re&s;t, he employed his pen in favour of that party during the latter end of queen Anne's reign. After he quitted the uni|ver&s;ity, he was in&s;tituted to the living of Hampton in Mid|dle&s;ex, and then to the united pari&s;hes of St. Mary, Somer&s;et, and St. Mary, Mounthaw, in the city of London, both which he held to his death. He was al&s;o chancellor, pre|bendary, canon re&s;identiary, and portioni&s;t, of the church of Hereford; and in the year 1732 was made archdeacon of Sa|lop, and chaplain in ordinary to the king. Dr. Croxall, who principally governed the church during the old age of the Bi&s;hop, pulled down an old &s;tone building of which the Antiquary Society had made a print, and with the materials built part of a hou&s;e for his brother Mr. Rodney Croxall. He obtained the living of Sellark, in Hereford&s;hive, in February 1734; and died, at a very advanced age, Feb. 13, 1752. He was au|thor of "The Fair Circa&s;&s;ian, 1720," 4to; of which his fir&s;t &s;pecimen is in the fourth volume of this collection, p. 120; and of many excellent poems, which I hope at &s;ome future period to find lei&s;ure to collect into a volume. He publi&s;hed a collection of
<Q>&startq;Fables of Ae&s;op and others, tran&s;lated into Engli&s;h, 1722,&endq;</Q>
12mo. and wrote all the dedications prefixed to the "Select Novels," printed for Watts, 1729. Dr. Croxall was al&s;o author of
<Q>&startq;Scrip|ture Politicks; being a View of the original Con&s;titu|tion, and &s;ub&s;equent Revolutions, in the Government, Religious and Civil, of that People, out of whom the Saviour of the World was to ari&s;e; as it is contained in the Bible, 1725&endq;</Q>

He w$$ from principle a &s;trenuous Nonjuror; but &s;oon relinqui&s;$ tho&s;e opinions from conviction. In the latter end of King William's reign, he was made a commi&s;&s;ioner of the cu&s;toms, through the intere&s;t of the Duke of Somer&s;et; and afterwards, by lord Godolphin, was appointed auditor of the impre&s;t. He had an amour with Mrs. Oldfield, by whom he had a &s;on of both his names, who married in 1739 Mi&s;s Pyne, a lady of fortune (who &s;urvived him till 1780), and died a captain in Harri&s;on's regiment at the &s;iege of Carthagena in 1741. The captain le&s;t an only daughter, an accompli&s;hed young lady, who has been dead &s;ome years. Mr. Maynwaring took an ac|tive part again&s;t Dr. Sacheverell; publi&s;hed &s;ome little tracts on that occa&s;ion; and was the author of &s;everal poetical and politi|cal pieces, mo&s;t of which are either in&s;erted or &s;pecified in his "Life and Po&s;thumous Works," publi&s;hed by Oldmixon (who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted con&s;iderably in "The Medley") in 1715. He died Nov. 13, 1712. Among&s;t other poetical productions of Mr. Maynwaring was a ver&s;ion of the fir&s;t book of Homer's Iliad. "Pope" &s;ays Dr. John&s;on," once intended to print
<Q>&startq;together the four ver&s;ions of Dryden, Maynwaring, Pope, and Tickell, that they might be readily compared and fairly e&s;timated. This de&s;ign &s;eems to have been defeated by the refu&s;al of Ton&s;on, who was the proprietor of the other three ver&s;ions.&endq;</Q>

<BYLINE>BY DR. COBDEN <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edward Cobden, D. D. chaplain in ordinary to King George the Second, was early in life chaplain to Bp. Gib&s;on, to who&s;e patronage he was indebted for the following prefer|ments; viz. the united rectories of St. Au&s;tin and St. Faith in London, with that of Acton in Middle&s;ex, a prebend of St. Paul's, another at Lincoln, and the archdeaconry of Lon|don, in which la&s;t he &s;ucceeded Dr. Tyrwhit in July 1742. He publi&s;hed a famous Sermon, preached before the King at St. James's, Dec. 11, 1748, intituled, "A Per&s;ua&s;ive to Cha&s;tity." In an adverti&s;ement, the Doctor ob&s;erves, "that, it having given occa&s;ion to &s;ome unju&s;t cen&s;ures, he thought it proper to publi&s;h it, hoping that nothing in the &s;entiment or expre&s;&s;ion will be found unworthy of the &s;acred function of a preacher of the Go&s;pel, or of the &s;erious attention of a Chri&s;tian a&s;&s;embly." The la&s;t time he preached before the King was Dec. 8, 1751. He re&s;igned his warrant for chaplain Nov. 23, 1752; after having delivered into his Maje&s;ty's hands his rea&s;ons in writing for &s;o doing. In 1755 he publi&s;hed a pamphlet, intituled, "An E&s;&s;ay tending to promote Reli|gion," 8vo. in the title-page of which he &s;tyles him&s;elf "late|ly Chaplain above twenty-two years to his Maje&s;ty;" and in 1756 "A Poem &s;acred to the memory of Queen Anne, for her Bounty to the Clergy," 4to.

<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Daughter of Sir Roger Manley, author of the fir&s;t volume of "The Turki&s;h Spy." She received an education &s;uitable to her birth; and gave early di&s;coveries of a genius &s;uperior to what is u&s;ually found among her &s;ex. In her infancy &s;he lo&s;t her mother; and early in life was cheated into marriage with a near relation, of her own name, who had at the &s;ame time a former wi&s;e living. De&s;erted by her hu&s;band, &s;he wore away three wretched years in &s;olitude till &s;he by accident be|came patroni&s;ed by the dutche&s;s of Cleveland, a mi&s;tre&s;s of Charles II; but the dutche&s;s, being of a fickle temper, grew tired of Mrs. Manley in &s;ix months, and di&s;charged her, on pretence that &s;he intrigued with her &s;on. Retiring again in|to &s;olitude, &s;he wrote her fir&s;t tragedy, "The Royal Mi&s;|chief." This play being acted at the Theatre Royal in 1696, with great &s;ucce&s;s; &s;he received &s;uch unbounded incen&s;e from the witty and the gay as in the end proved fatal to her virtue. In the &s;ame year, &s;he al&s;o produced a comedy inti|tuled, "The Lo&s;t Lover, or Jealous Hu&s;band," which was performed without any &s;ucce&s;s. Her third Dramatic piece was "Almyna, or The Arabian Vow, a Tragedy, 1707." In her retired hours, &s;he wrote her four volumes of the "Me|moirs of the New Atalantis," in which &s;he was not only very free with her own &s;ex, in her wanton de&s;cription of love-adventures, but al&s;o with the characters of many high and di&s;tingui&s;hed per&s;onages. Her father had always been attach|ed to the cau&s;e of Charles I. and &s;he her&s;elf had a confirmed aver&s;ion to the Whig mini&s;try; &s;o that the repre&s;entations of many characters in her Atalantis are nothing but &s;atires upon tho&s;e who had brought about the Revolution. Upon this, a warrant was granted from the &s;ecretary of &s;tate's office, to &s;eize the printer and publi&s;her of tho&s;e volumes. Mrs. Manley had too much genero&s;ity to let innocent per&s;ons &s;uf|fer on her account; and therefore voluntarily acknowledged her&s;elf the author of the work in que&s;tion. When &s;he was examined before lord Sunderland, who was then &s;ecretary, he was curious to know, from whom &s;he got information of &s;ome particulars, which he imagined to be above her own intelligence. She replied, with great humility, that &s;he had no de&s;ign in writing, farther than her own amu&s;ement and diver&s;ion in the country, without intending particular reflec|tions and characters, and did a&s;&s;ure him, that nobody was concerned with her. When this was not believed, and the contrary urged again&s;t her by &s;everal circum&s;tances, &s;he &s;aid
<Q>&startq;then it mu&s;t be by in&s;piration, becau&s;e knowing her own innocence &s;he could account for it no other way.&endq;</Q>
The &s;ecretary replied, that
<Q>&startq;in&s;piration u&s;ed to be upon a good account; but that her writings were &s;tark-naught.&endq;</Q>
She acknowledged
<Q>&startq;that his lord&s;hip's ob&s;ervation might be true; but, as there were evil angels as well as good, what &s;he had written might &s;till be by in&s;piration.&endq;</Q>
The con&s;e|quence of this examination was, that Mrs. Manley was clo&s;e &s;hut up in a me&s;&s;enger's hou&s;e, without being allowed pen&punc; ink, and paper. However, her council &s;ued out her Habeas Corpus, and &s;he was admitted to bail. Whether tho&s;e in power were a&s;hamed to bring a woman to trial for writing a few amorous trifles, or whether the laws could not reach her, &s;he was di&s;charged, after &s;everal times expo&s;ing her&s;elf in per&s;on to cro&s;s the court before the bench of judges, with her three attendants, the printer and two publi&s;hers. Not long after, a total change of the mini&s;try en&s;ued; &s;he then $ame into great favour with their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and was employed in defending the Four la&s;t Years of the Queen. The pam|phlets which &s;he wrote at this period are numerous, and &s;ome of them &s;uch as would not di&s;grace the be&s;t pen that ove$ wrote in the defence of government. After Dean Swift re|linqui&s;hed "The Examiner," &s;he continued it with great &s;pirit for a con&s;iderable time, and frequently fini&s;hed pieces begun by that excellent writer, who al&s;o often u&s;ed to furni&s;h her with hints for tho&s;e of her own compo&s;ition. At this time, or &s;oon afterwards, &s;he became connected with Alderman Bar|ber, who was then the favourite Tory printer, and with him &s;he re&s;ided until the time of her death, which happened on the 11th of July 1724, at his hou&s;e on Lambeth Hill. She was buried in the middle ai&s;le of the church of St. Bennet, Paul's Wharf, where a marble grave &s;tone was erected to her memory. A &s;econd edition of a volume of her Letters was publi&s;hed in 1713. "Lucius," a well-received tragedy, written by her, and acted in 1717, was dedicated to Sir Ri|chard Steele, whom &s;he had abu&s;ed in her "Atalantis;" but who was then on &s;uch friendly terms with her, that he wrote the prologue to this play, as Mr. Prior did the epilogue. Mr. Steele's prologue is printed in this collection vol. IV. p. 19. Some account of her life has been publi&s;hed by her&s;elf, under the title of "Memoirs of Rivella." N.</NOTE>
