Hi Jing,

  This is a tricky one. The text (though from ECCO) has
much in common with the very early EEBO books, since it
contains a 'diplomatic transcription' of a medieval
manuscript--an attempt to represent the visual appearance
of the manuscript, including all the Latin abbreviation
symbols, etc.

  Since the book attempts to represent its source
exactly, line by line, I suggest that we do likewise,
marking line breaks with <LB> tags, and ignoring the
fact that this will divide some words.

  The abbreviation symbols are not well printed, and
sometimes the wrong symbol was used. I think the best
thing to do with these is to capture them as specifically
as the visual appearance makes possible, but not attempt
to interpret them beyond that. This means that most
of the symbols will be captured using the usual "~"
sign, and many with the common &abcon; &abque; and &abus;
signs; I have also made use of the specific symbols
for characters with strokes through them, e.g.
&lstrok;, &hstrok; &dstrok; and &bstrok; (though using
<ABBR> instead of these is ok) as well as
our special entity for "z used as an abbreviation marker"
(&z;), for reasons explained below. Most of these were
already in our character inventory, but I did need to
add &bstrok; (U+0180).


Of the specific ones that you ask about:

image001 should be captured as '&abrum;'
  (the abbreviation symbol for "-rum")

image002 should be captured as 'picto&abrum;'
  (i.e., an abbreviated form of the word "pictorum")

image003 is the so-called "Tironian et" (Unicode U+204A).
  This is simply an old form of ampersand (&) and
  may be captured using the usual ampersand entity
  (&amp;).

image004 may thus be captured as 'dedit &amp; i~de'.

image005 is confusing. I think it is a mistake. It
  *should* mean "quoque" and should contain a 'q'
  with an 'o' over it, followed by a second 'q'
  with a 'z' or '3' after it, i.e., "q^o&abque;"
  But one of the 'q's is missing. I think the best
  we can do is capture the visual form, like this:

     'q^o&z;' (that is, 'q' with a superscript 'o',
     followed by an abbreviating 'z')

image006 therefore may be captured like this:
  &s;cithia q^o&z; &amp;

image007 is the usual abbreviation sign for "-bus"
  (&abbus;).

image008 is the same, used in a word, which may
  therefore be captured as 'qui&abbus;'

image009 represents another way to abbreviate the
  same word (quibus), in this case using a superscript
  'i' to stand for '-ui'. I would capture it as
  q^i&abbus;

image010 is another problem. The symbol is an abbreviation
  for "qua-" and the two little marks above the 'q' are
  what is left of an 'a'. (I think.) So we *could* capture
  this as 'q^a'. But that is going a little too far from
  what is actually there. I suggest using the simpler
  <ABBR>qi</ABBR>.

image011 is the same symbol used in a word ("quasi"). But
  given the advice above, I would capture it as
  '<ABBR>qi</ABBR> dagos'

I have tried to type in a few of these pages, in the
hope that this will help. (I have added line numbers
on the left, simply for convenience of reference), and
appended many notes of explanation at the bottom.

Please pardon any typographic erors!

Notes
-----

Line 2. The symbol is the usual one for '-rum', i.e.
  &abrum;. If spelled out, the words would be
  "antiquorum pictorum."

Line 3. Here and elsewhere, the printer uses
  the "per" abbreviation symbol (&abper;) where
  he should use the "pro" symbol (&abpro;). I have
  allowed his error to remain, and used &abper;.

Line 4. I've used the more specific "&hstrok;"
  for the barred-h in the first word. Use of
  <ABBR> would also be fine (<ABBR>ht</ABBR>).

  The 'q.' must be an abbreviation for 'quod';
  one would expect the usual &abquod; symbol,
  but it is not there. Perhaps the printer did
  not have one available.

Line 6. Two more examples of the '-rum' abbreviation
  symbol (&abrum;).

Lines 7-8. "corrupte" is broken at the line end, but I
  have allowed the word to break (to appear in two pieces)
  in order to preserve the line breaks.

Lines 8 & 36. The apostrophe in "hib'nienses"
  may be the "-er-" abbreviation symbol, but capture
  as a simple apostrophe is simpler and safer.

Lines 9 & 38. The word that looks like "q2" is
  actually "qr" (using the '2-shaped r') and is
  an abbreviation for 'quia' or 'quare'. Capture
  simply as 'qr'.

Line 13. The word at the end of the line must be
  "fertur", so the hyphen-like thing must be an &abur;
  abbreviation mark, but I have to admit that it does
  not look much like one!

Line 14. "q." (or "q:") at the end of the line is the same
  abbreviation for 'quod' as in line 4. I have left it
  as "q."

Line 15. I have again used the more specific entity
  "bstrok" (as I used "hstrok" back in line 4), and
  again, use of a simple <ABBR> tag instead would be ok.

  I have captured the third word on the line as
  "t&aber;cia", since it is probably an abbreviation
  of "tercia"--but I have to admit that the first
  letter does not look much like a 't' with an '-er-'
  abbreviation; it looks more like an 'l' with a stroke
  (?). Capture as <ABBR>#cia</ABBR> may be the best
  we can do.

Lines 18-19. Two more examples of &bstrok;; in both cases
  capture using <ABBR> would also be fine. (<ABBR>bniam</ABBR>
  and <ABBR>albo</ABBR>.

Line 25. I have used "&lstrok;" for the 'l' with a bar
  through it, but <ABBR> would also be fine. The 9-shaped
  mark at the end is the abbreviation mark for "-us"
  (&abus;). So capture as <ABBR>pl&abus;</ABBR> or
  p&lstrok;&abus; would both be fine.

  The 'q' that follows is evidently an abbreviation
  for "quam", but it does not show the standard form
  of the &abquam; symbol, so I would capture simply as "q~."
  The two words together abbreviate "plusquam".

Line 26. I cannot tell if the horizontal stroke is meant
  to be over both the 'a' and the 't' or just the 'a'.
  I have captured it as being over both, though only over
  the 'a' would perhaps make a little more sense.

Lines 30 & 79. The large black dot is evidently a badly printed
  superscript 'e'. In line 30, the word is an abbreviation of
  'greci' and in line 79 an abbreviation of 'credunt'. In both
  cases I have captured the superscripted letter as $ (illegible).

Line 44. Note the &abcon; abbreviation symbol at the beginning
  of the first word.

Lines 47, 52. The last word is presumably 'usque', which
  normally is abbreviated "usq3" (i.e. "us&abque;"), but the 'q'
  seems to be missing, much as with the 'q^o&z;' in line
  42. In both cases, a 'q' is missing, which makes it
  hard to capture as &abque;, I think. In both
  cases, I resorted to capturing the z-shaped thing at
  the end as 'abbreviating z' (&z;). Capturing the z as &abque;
  would also be ok, even though it would be an abnormal form.

Lines 73, 82. 'dr' and 'pr'. These are abbreviations using
  the '2-shaped r'. The first is for 'dicitur' and the
  second for 'pater'. But they may be captured simply as
  'dr' and 'pr'.

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE hi&s;ory of Scotland begins to be &s;ufficiently clear at the commence|ment of the reign of Malcom III. or the year 1056. But the period preceding that date has been long lo&s;t in fiction, for the &s;ame rea&s;on that an uncultivated field is over-grown with weeds: indu&s;try being as nece&s;&s;ary in the literary as in the natural world.</P>
<P>Struck with the deplorable &s;tate of the an|cient hi&s;tory of his country, at a time &s;o enlightened as the pre&s;ent, and when mo&s;t other kingdoms have weighed their antiqui|ties in the &s;ober &s;cales of critici&s;m, the au|thor has devoted years of labour to this pur|&s;uit. Be&s;ides the powerful motive of curio|&s;ity, that fountain of human knowlege, he
<PB N="iv" REF="3">was influenced by the wi&s;h of being u&s;eful to his countrymen; among whom he was concerned to &s;ee the mo&s;t ingenious writers daily &s;tarting the mo&s;t hypothetic conjec|tures concerning their early hi&s;tory. To ex|amine the &s;ubject to the bottom were re|quired con&s;iderable reading, previous experi|ence in &s;uch matters, much lei&s;ure and love of the &s;ubject, and no great de&s;ire of wealth or fame. As the&s;e are no longer objects of prai&s;e, the author may, without offending mode&s;ty, lay claim to a portion of them.</P>
<P>The importance of the work was indeed &s;uch as might have excited, and required, far &s;upe|rior abilities. To fix the hi&s;tory of a country on the eternal ba&s;is of truth, is certainly none of the meane&s;t of human enterprizes: nor is it a &s;mall object to attempt to remove from any nation that mo&s;t di&s;graceful of all kinds of ignorance, the ignorance of its own hi&s;tory. One of the greate&s;t of the ancients has warmly expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf on this &s;ubject; telling us that, "Not to know what has happened before one's birth, is to be always a child." And he ob&s;erves el&s;ewhere, with great ju&s;tice, that "to him none &s;eemed to have any claim to learning, who were igno|rant concerning the affairs of their own

But in &s;ubjects of this kind, the greate&s;t la|bour is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; and a &s;uperfi|cial book may be ever regarded as a fal&s;e one. A thou&s;and grains of gold mu&s;t be collected, and formed into one ingot; a thou&s;and little facts mu&s;t be conjoined; a thou&s;and fal&s;ehoods exploded. No theory can be admitted; nor is it even allowed to argue from one fact to another. The cir|cum&s;tances are &s;o minute, and various, that great literary experience is required to guard again&s;t mi&s;takes. <HI>Il faut etre extremement au fait de ces matieres pour ne s'y point tromper,</HI> &s;ays a learned writer on the&s;e &s;ubjects<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pelloutier, Hi&s;t. des Celtes, I. 30.</NOTE>, all who&s;e care could not however &s;ave him from radical errors. Tho&s;e points which, in theory, have mo&s;t veri&s;imilitude, will upon laborious examination of the facts, prove to be entirely fal&s;e; and tho&s;e which &s;eemed fal&s;e in theory, will prove true in fact.</P>
<P>The Abb&eacute; Raynal ob&s;erves that after the revival of letters we began with <HI>Eruditi,</HI>
<PB N="vii" REF="6">next we had Poets, then Orators, then Me|taphy&s;icians, then Geometricians. If it were allowed, adds he, to hazard a prediction, i would announce that our minds will &s;peedily be turned to hi&s;tory; a va&s;t career, and in which philo&s;ophy has hardly yet &s;et a foot. This prediction is daily fulfilling in all countries: and, be&s;ide other happy effects, is attended by this, that it has contributed to revive a genuine and dignified erudition, very different from the trifling &s;ort at fir&s;t in vogue. For it being impo&s;&s;ible to throw philo&s;ophy into the hi&s;tory of any country, without carefully exploring the facts of that hi&s;tory and as impo&s;&s;ible to know the&s;e facts without &s;tudying them in original au|thors; a great degree of erudition has be|come nece&s;&s;ary to this philo&s;ophy and eru|dition and philo&s;ophy being thus conjoined, have increa&s;ed the mental wealth of mankind to a great degree. The &s;tudy of the Greek and Roman writers has become more manly and important; and that of the authors of the middle ages, at fir&s;t too much neglected, gains ground every day. Even a degree of what was called pedantry, by the pretended <HI>beaux e&s;prits,</HI> has become admi&s;&s;ible in treating an|cient hi&s;tory; becau&s;e all &s;ee that it is better to &s;hew too much learning upon &s;uch &s;ub|jects,
<PB N="viii" REF="7">than too little. Indeed tho pedantry be contemptible, becau&s;e u&s;ele&s;s, in natural and moral philo&s;ophy, poetry, and other departments of genius, and &s;cience; yet in hi&s;tory it is even laudable, if it be not di|gre&s;&s;ive. For hi&s;tory re&s;ting entirely on facts, and authorities, it mu&s;t have many references and quotations; which, in any other &s;cience, form the e&s;&s;ence of pedantic erudition.</P>
<P>The&s;e remarks are e&s;pecially in&s;erted for the u&s;e of my countrymen, who, as they can very &s;eldom be accu&s;ed of pedantry them&s;elves, are very apt to accu&s;e others of it. A book written in the manner of the Italian, French, German, and Scandinavian antiquaries, may perhaps &s;tartle them, not le&s;s by the perpetual quotations and refe|rences, than by the apparent novelty, but real antiquity of the facts developed. They may perhaps &s;ay that the author has come after many men of learning in this tract; and yet mode&s;tly pretends to prove them all in the wrong, even in the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential points of early Scoti&s;h hi&s;tory. This fore|&s;een critici&s;m mu&s;t be warded off <HI>(non ut arguerem, &s;ed ne arguerer)</HI> by a few re|marks; which, as they are of &s;ome delicacy,
<PB N="ix" REF="8">are written with deference, and it is hoped will be received with candour by every Scoti&s;hman, who, with the author, de&s;ires to be the FRIEND, and not the <HI>flatterer,</HI> of his country.</P>
<P>In all ages, &s;ince the invention of letters, two oppo&s;ite literary paths have conducted to the temple of fame; the path of GENIUS, and that of ERUDITION. They refer to the two faculties of the mind, Imagination and Me|mory; as for Judgment, the third, it is a judge, and not an agent; and mu&s;t, direct the efforts of the two others. The&s;e quail|ties in a le&s;&s;er degree, bear the names of <HI>In|genuity</HI> and <HI>Learning.</HI> Every one, who has looked into literary hi&s;tory, mu&s;t know that Erudition, or even Learning, is per|haps a &s;urer path to fame, than Genius or Ingenuity; ina&s;much as innumerable ancient works of mere learning have reached our times<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gellius, Macrobius, Clemens Alex. Athenaeus, Photius, Suidas, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE>, whereas not one of mere genius has had that fortune. For Homer, Pindar, and the other famous poets, were all men as, re|markable for learning as for genius; which qualities conjoined alone &s;tamp perfection on a work. Homer's learning aro&s;e from tra|velling,
<PB N="x" REF="9" MS="Y">and conver&s;ation; as Shak&s;pere's from books in his own language. Of all the ancient poets, that is of tho&s;e writers who&s;e e&s;&s;ential form is genius, it is impo&s;&s;ible to point out one who was not profoundly learned; if we only except Anacreon, who&s;e remains are &s;o few; that we cannot judge of his learning from them. It is indeed as im|po&s;&s;ible to be a great writer without learning, as to be wealthy without property, or to unite any other contradiction in terms. Nay in modern times men of va&s;t erudition, and men of va&s;t genius, have generally been co|temporary in the &s;ame country; as Shak|&s;pere and Saville, Milton and Selden, in Eng|land; Corneille and Salma&s;ius in France; Ta&s;&s;o and Sigonius in Italy; Cervantes and Aldrete in Spain, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now by a misfortune, chiefly ari&s;ing from the remote &s;ituation of the country, while Scotland has produced many ingenious wri|ters, it is impo&s;&s;ible to conde&s;cend upon one, who (not to mention ERUDITION), can even bear the appellation of <HI>learned,</HI> as &s;trictly under&s;tood in more favoured countries. To write elegant Latin, for which our Scoti&s;h authors of the two la&s;t centuries were fa|mous, is a quality of ingenuity; and is &s;o far
<PB N="xi" REF="10" MS="Y">from belonging to learning, that it is inimical to it; for the time, in&s;tead of being occu|pied in reading books, is employed in &s;tudy|ing a language, a matter radically different. This we may judge of from facts; for Po|land, a country of ten times more population than Scotland, has not produced one learned writer, tho the Latin hi&s;tories of Dlugo&s;s, Cromer, and Kobier&s;icky, are thought to vye with Livy, and Grotius has preferred Ca&s;imir to Horace.</P>
<P>This neglect of learning in Scotland, as it is the real and only cau&s;e of the ruin of our ancient hi&s;tory, de&s;erves e&s;pecially to be con&s;idered here; and every true, patriot would wi&s;h, if po&s;&s;ible to remove it. The writings of Volu&s;enus or Wil&s;on, Buchanan, and Barclay, are ju&s;tly celebrated for ele|gance and ingenuity: but if we were to con|de&s;cend on any learned books, written by Scoti&s;hmen, it is believed the only ones that could po&s;&s;ibly be named, are Demp&s;ter's notes on Ro&s;inus, and his Etruria Regalis, and Blackwell's Enquiry into the Life and Writings of Homer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The neglect of Greek learning is chiefly to be regreted in Scotland; and it is a pity that the plan of Era&s;mus is not followed, and the Greek taught be|fore the Latin in all countries. Five or &s;ix years for Latin, and one for Greek is the common plan in Scoti&s;h &s;chools. The rever&s;e would be exactly right. There is an originality in the Greek writers which forms and nurtures genius; the Latin only fo&s;ter imi|tation. A divine, or a phy&s;ician, ought to be grounded in Greek. A lawyer requires Latin, for there is not one Greek writer on law.</NOTE>. Yet even the&s;e
<PB N="xii" REF="11">would in Italy, France, or Germany, &s;tand only among the books of common learning; and are &s;o far from being works of erudi|tion, that, compared to tho&s;e of eruditi of the fir&s;t cla&s;s, the Sigonii, Salma&s;ii, Vo&s;&s;ii, Grotii, Huetii, Scaligeri, they are but as drops of water to the ocean. Nor can one help expre&s;&s;ing a wi&s;h that even that kind of erudition, which is now rather di&s;regarded, (tho the fame of tho&s;e eminent in it will la&s;t as long as books are redd), had been ex|erted in Scotland in its period, as well as in other countries: for the pa&s;&s;age from eru|dition to &s;cience is &s;afe and ea&s;y; while he who begins with &s;cience begins to build without materials.</P>
<P>Sir I&s;aac Newton being a&s;ked by what &s;ingular faculty he could make &s;uch great di&s;coveries, an&s;wered, with all the mode&s;ty of genius, that he pretended to no faculties, but what were common; and that the only
<PB N="xiii" REF="12">&s;ource of his di&s;coveries was PATIENT THINKING. This in fact will ever be the chief &s;ource of philo&s;ophical di&s;coveries; and the only &s;ource of literary di&s;coveries is PATIENT READING. But the <HI>fervidum in|genium Scotorum,</HI> as one of our own writers calls it, is &s;o remarkable that almo&s;t every battle we anciently fought again&s;t the Eng|li&s;h wag lo&s;t by impatience, from the battle of the Standard to the battle of Dunbar. This chief feature of the national character is ob&s;ervable even in trifles, for in England two pea&s;ants will fight coolly, and then &s;hake hands, while in Scotland &s;uch com|bats are always committed in grievous pa&s;|&s;ion. In literature and philo&s;ophy the &s;ame impatience prevails; and the con&s;equenge is that we have not only never produced any man of erudition, but we have al&s;o had no INVENTOR, no man who has opened up a new path in &s;cience. We cannot boa&s;t like Denmark of a Tycho Brahe, nor like Swe|den of a Linnaeus, nor like Poland of a Co|pernicus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Napier has much merit, but cannot &s;tand in the rank of great inventors. He is only an u&s;eful abbre|viator of a particular branch of the mathematics.</NOTE>. By the &s;ame impatience of thought, and of labour, our writers of every cla&s;s, tho often ingenious and elegant in a &s;u|preme
<PB N="xiv" REF="13">degree, have never yet attained the characters of great or &s;ublime. We have no Bacon, no Newton, up Shak&s;pere, no Mil|ton.</P>
<P>The&s;e remarks are given not to upbraid, but to admoni&s;h, and to &s;erve.

Far le&s;s are they obtruded from a dictatorial &s;pi|rit; but they are humbly &s;ubmitted to our literati of Scotland, among whom there are at pre&s;ent many who&s;e abilities would do honour to any country; and who more than compen&s;ate for any defect of learning, by &s;uperior good &s;en&s;e, elegant per&s;picuity, and indu&s;trious u&s;e of tho&s;e materials which are nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ubjects of which they treat.

<P>On con&s;idering the cau&s;es of the neglect of learning in Scotland, they appear to be three.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Remote &s;ituation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Want of wealth.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Want of public libraries.</ITEM>
</LIST> The di&s;tance of Scotland from Italy, France, and Germany, the mo&s;t learned countries of Europe, is a great di&s;advantage in point of literary intercour&s;e, and emulation. Den|mark and Sweden, from their proximity, to Germany, have produced many writers of far greater learning than Scotland has; a country pent up in a remote corner of an iland, and to which few foreign books come, except the mo&s;t light and &s;uperficial, which float on the breath of popular fame. Want of wealth (the con&s;equence of want of indu&s;try) is a grand cau&s;e; but which will be remedied as indu&s;try increa&s;es. They who have no money to buy books, cannot have them; and it is ob&s;ervable that all the chief Eruditi, of every country and age, have been men of large property, and who could afford to purcha&s;e libraries. The only remedy for this is the in&s;titution of public libraries, containing books of high charac|ter for learning and utility, tho never to be found in circulating libraries, where indeed they cannot be expected, as very few read them. The in&s;titution of a public library,
<PB N="xvi" REF="15">of the genuine kind, &s;uch as are common in Italy, France, and Germany, as they were in ancient Greece and Rome, tho totally un|known in Britain, would do any patriot more honour, and would &s;erve his country more, than the foundation of an univer&s;ity. In few countries are youth more curious in literature, than in Scotland; but they want opportunities and choice. The &s;tudy of Bib|liography, now carried to a great height in mo&s;t countries, may indeed be pointed out as nece&s;&s;ary even to our be&s;t authors, who, for want of it, often quote the wor&s;t writers upon &s;ubjects. When books are &s;o numerous, the knowlege of the be&s;t in each cla&s;s be|comes nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Such having been the &s;tate of learning in Scotland, it is no wonder that in antiquities, a &s;ubject ab&s;olutely dependant upon much reading, this defect &s;hould become the mo&s;t apparent. Ingenious conjecture, and ele|gant manner, can never have any effect in illu&s;trating antiquities, the very province of patient indu&s;try. The more ingenious an author is in &s;uch matters, lie will only be the more in the wrong<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"We no longer &s;tudy;" &s;ays Rou&s;&s;eau, <Q>we no &startq;longer ob&s;erve: we dream: and the dreams of &s;ome &endq;bad nights are given us gravely for philo&s;ophy.</Q></NOTE>. The exclama|tion
<PB N="xvii" REF="16" MS="Y">of Monte&s;quieu, in his letters, <HI>Vous etes tous des charlatans, Me&s;&s;iurs les Antiquaires!</HI> may be applied to tho&s;e of Scotland, with peculiar ju&s;tice. The weake&s;t writers in the country have generally a&s;&s;umed this pro|vince, which became them as well as if a mule &s;hould pretend to carry the tower of an elephant: while the be&s;t &s;eem to de&s;pi&s;e the name and province of an antiquary, for|getful of the examples of Cato, Varro, Cae&s;ar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cato's work on Roman origins is quoted by Dio|ny&s;ius Hal. Varro is well known. Julius Cae&s;ar wrote <HI>De vocum Mutations,</HI> &amp;c. Melanchthon and Luther's works on German antiquities may be found in the fir&s;t volume of the Collection by Schardius, Ba&s;il. 1574, fol.</NOTE>, in ancient times, and of Luther, Melanch|thon Spelman, Selden, Du Cange, Leibnitz, Muratori, and many others, confe&s;&s;edly men of great talents, in modern. Monte&s;quieu has examined the hi&s;tory of the two fir&s;t races of France, preceding the tenth cen|tury, with an antiquarian care, which a Scoti&s;h writer of talents might think be|neath him. <HI>Homine imperito nihil e&s;t inju&s;tius:</HI> this contempt, if real, is lamentable; as no &s;cience can be &s;tudied where it is de&s;pi&s;ed. But, as Lord Bacon ob&s;erves in his E&s;&s;ays, "Some, what&s;oever is beyond their reach, will &s;eem to de&s;pi&s;e, or make light of, as
<PB N="xviii" REF="17">impertinent, or curious; and &s;o would have their ignorance &s;eem judgment." The un|certainty of antiquities is common to, all human &s;ciences; and &s;trikes tho&s;e the mo&s;t who are the lea&s;t ver&s;ed in them, as objects at a di&s;tance become indi&s;tinct. Experience, and long examination of a &s;ubject, remove many uncertainties. But writers are apt to exhau&s;t all their faith upon the object of their particular &s;tudy, or favour; to believe perhaps that they know all the motives of human action in modern times, while they will not believe the actions them&s;elves be|yond a certain epoch. To him who looks with an equal eye upon &s;cience, the know|lege of a few ancient events, duly authenti|cated by ancient evidence, becomes, at lea&s;t as credible, as that of the numerous modern events, with all their motives, cau&s;es, and circum&s;tances, detailed by modern omni&s;cient hi&s;torians, &s;ometimes not even ver&s;ed in the language of the country, who&s;e hi&s;tory they relate. To him who&s;e belief depends upon his rea&s;on, the truth of ancient and of mo|dern hi&s;tory will appear much the &s;ame; or he may be inclined to think the death of &s;uch an ancient king, in &s;uch a year, as credible at lea&s;t as that &s;uch a modern event happened, occa&s;ioned by &s;uch cau&s;es, and
<PB N="xix" REF="18" MS="Y">attended by &s;uch circum&s;tances, as a mo|dern hi&s;torian well knows, tho quite un|known to the actors them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The want of patience and indu&s;try in our Scoti&s;h antiqui&s;ts, has only been equalled by their puerile prejudices, and contempt of truth. The author of this work thought it his duty to read them all repeatedly; an attention which, excepting one or two, they did not de&s;erve. Innes, in particular, is a valuable writer; but to mo&s;t of the others may be applied the French proverb, <HI>De fol juge bref &s;entence;</HI> or the maxim of Rochefoucault, <HI>Quand un opiniatre a com|men&eacute; &agrave; conte&s;ter quelque cho&s;e, &s;on e&s;prit &s;e ferme a tout ce qui peut l'eclaircir. La con|te&s;tation l'irrite, quelque ju&s;te qu'elle &s;oit; et il &s;emble qu'il ait peur de trouver la verit&eacute;.</HI> Neg|lecting tho&s;e objects, which do real credit to their country, they have loaded her with extraneous ornaments, till, like the Tarpeian virgin, &s;he dies under the fal&s;e honours. Their inexperience in &s;uch &s;ubjects has led them into trains of rea&s;oning never u&s;ed in antiquarian matters; and they have what may be called <HI>points of honour of Scotland,</HI> quite unknown in more enlightened coun|tries. Yet to the&s;e mock points of honour
<PB N="xx" REF="19" MS="Y">they will &s;acrifice the mo&s;t evident truth, having, as lord Bacon phra&s;es, an uncon|querable appetite for fal&s;ehood and fable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Il &s;uffit de faire un retour &s;ur &s;on propre coeur, d'examiner avec quelle confiance on s' abandonne aux ab&s;urdit&eacute;s, au milieu de&s;quelles on e&s;t n&eacute;; combien il en coute &agrave; la rai&s;on pour deranger les habitudes qu'on a contract&eacute;es.

Some of them, as Maitland in particular, have even &s;at down to the &s;acred ta&s;k of hi&s;tory, with all the&s;e prejudices around them; but in the words of D'Alembert, <HI>Ils ecrivent l'Hi&s;toire, comme la plupart des hommes la li&s;ent, pour n'etre pas oblig&eacute;s de pen&s;er; et &s;e font ain&s;i auteurs &agrave; peu de frais.</HI></P>

<P>Want of learning, which opens and en|larges the mind, is no doubt one great cau&s;e of the&s;e odd prejudices; for, as an able writer<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Home Lord Kaims, Sketches of the Hi&s;tory of Man, III. 218. 8vo. edit.</NOTE> ob&s;erves, "The under&s;tanding is, among the illiterate, ob&s;equious to pa&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="xxi" REF="20">and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: and among them the imagination acts without controul, forming conclu&s;ions often no better than mere dreams." The, reader will excu&s;e the&s;e quotations, as they not only expre&s;s the &s;entiments in a manner not to be improved, but &s;erve to protect an author in the invidious and pain|ful office of finding faults.</P>
<P>Even in the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t improved minds, prejudice has too much &s;way; for it is impo&s;&s;ible to examine every thing. Hence it is not &s;urprizing to find men of the greate&s;t talents infected with the contagion of, national prejudices. Voltaire has ju&s;tly ob&s;erved on this &s;ubject, that, "Mankind are fonder of appearing to know, than of &s;eeking after knowlege; and when error has gotten the ma&s;tery of our minds, during our tender age, we are at no pains to &s;hake off its yoke, but rather &s;trive to &s;ubject our|&s;elves more to it. Hence it comes that &s;o many men of real di&s;cernment and genius are &s;o frequently under the dominion of po|pular errors<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Gen.</NOTE>." We need not therefore be &s;urprized to &s;ee popular prejudices, even in the be&s;t Scoti&s;h writers; for, as has been
<PB N="xxii" REF="21" MS="Y">remarked, we are reformed, from popery, but not from Hector Boethius<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dalrymple, Lord Hailes in his Annals of Scotland.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The effects of ignorant prejudices have been heightened to a &s;urprizing degree, a|mong our Scoti&s;h antiqui&s;ts, by the &s;pirit of controver&s;y, &s;o inimical to truth. The Eng|li&s;h and Iri&s;h writers, who fir&s;t began to de|tect the errors into which we had fallen, and to &s;hew the fallibility of Hector Boethius, were regarded as enemies of the honour of Scotland; which, if we may credit our an|tiqui&s;ts, &s;tands upon fal&s;ehoods only. For the&s;e writers, in&s;tead of applauding the &s;u|perior learning of an U&s;her and a Stilling|fleet, provided a Sir George Mackenzie, king's advocate for Scotland, to an&s;wer them; and who&s;e chief argument was, that it was high trea&s;on to doubt of the antiquity of the royal race of Scotland<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Defence of the Antiquity of the Royal Line of Scotland.</NOTE>! This con|vincing proof of our antiquities was ap|plauded; and the author, in&s;tead of being &s;ent to bedlam, was regarded as a zealous friend of his country. This was the more remarkable, as Sir George pretended to be a Stoic philo&s;opher; but it is ob&s;ervable that,
<PB N="xxiii" REF="22" MS="Y">from Sir George to Lord Kaims, no Scoti&s;h philo&s;opher has extended his philo&s;ophy to Scotland; for which the rea&s;on may be found in the above ob&s;ervation of Voltaire. When &s;uch were the beginnings of the di&s;|pute with the Engli&s;h and Iri&s;h antiquaries, it is no wonder that the ob&s;tinacy and ab|&s;urdity of our writers increa&s;ed in the pro|gre&s;s of the debate. They were &s;o ignorant as not even to know that it is impo&s;&s;ible to confute ancient authorities, upon no autho|rities at all; that, as no hi&s;torian had ari&s;en in Scotland preceding Fordun, who is quite a modern, it was ridiculous to &s;peak of op|po&s;ing our writers to the Engli&s;h and Iri&s;h; that all other countries allowed the authori|ties of neighbouring nations concerning their affairs; and that, if we gave way to conjec|ture and fooli&s;h ingenuity, there was an end of all hi&s;tory. At the &s;ame time, it is much to be regretted,, that the detection of our own errors did not, as in Denmark and Sweden, ari&s;e among our&s;elves; but this mu&s;t be imputed to our want of men of learning. The Engli&s;h and Iri&s;h antiquaries were far from being free of prejudice and enmity on their part: and it is not &s;urpriz|ing that the truth became obnoxious to our warm writers. At length Innes, our own
<PB N="xxiv" REF="23">countryman, taking the true &s;ide, we have been gradually finding that truth is more for the honour of Scotland than fal&s;ehood. But our antiqui&s;ts, driven from their mock au|thorities, have been forced to another ab&s;ur|dity; and to the genuine ancient authorities they oppo&s;e <HI>opinions!</HI> This phaenomenon in literature is only owing to the little learning we had gradually becoming le&s;s; for, as Lord Kaims ob&s;erves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sketches, III. 394.</NOTE>, "There cannot be opinion and &s;cience of the &s;ame thing at the &s;ame time." Opinion is the la&s;t refuge of ignorance and prejudice; and he who knows nothing of a &s;ubject can always give an opi|nion. The Spani&s;h poet who was told of the certainty of the mathematics, an&s;wered, "It may be &s;o, but in my opinion they are quite fallacious."</P>
<P>No axiom can be more certain than, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for fal&s;ehood to honour a country, or to &s;erve it. The author of na|ture, who has connected vital heat with the light of the &s;un, has connected the utility and glory of &s;ociety with truth. A &s;ceptic may &s;ay that the truth is not to be known; and to him it shall only be an&s;wered, that hi&s;tory is a &s;cience, and mu&s;t, like other &s;ci|ences,
<PB N="xxv" REF="24">have rules peculiar to it: of which the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential is, that, when conform|able to ancient authorities, it is to be re|garded as true; and, when not, as fal&s;e. This is the grand, and only, di&s;tinction be|tween hi&s;tory and romance. Fal&s;ehood is &s;o far from honouring, or &s;erving, any country, that it is di&s;graceful, and prejudicial, in a &s;u|preme degree. In hi&s;tory it makes even the true parts &s;u&s;pected; &s;o that a &s;ub&s;tance is lo&s;t by gra&s;ping at a &s;hadow: and a train of writers &s;upporting it in a nation will, in cour&s;e of time, taint even the character of that nation, and all the individuals of it; an effect &s;o ruinous, that he who writes on the hi&s;tory of his country, ought to con&s;ult con|&s;cience, as well as &s;cience. If he indulges the <HI>in&s;anos oculos et gaudia vana,</HI> at the ex|pence of plain truth; in&s;tead of being the friend of his country, he is in effect the wor&s;t enemy po&s;&s;ible. Like a ba&s;e flatterer his prai&s;e poi&s;ons, his deceit ruins.</P>
<P>As prejudice is irrational, &s;o the honours it invents are irrational. The honour of a nation depends on its arms and arts, on its indu&s;try, on the merit of its natives, and on the character it bears among its neighbours: which la&s;t can never be &s;o effectually injured
<PB N="xxvi" REF="25">as by fal&s;e hi&s;tory. But the Scoti&s;h anti|qui&s;ts ra&s;hly a&s;&s;ume the mo&s;t ludicrous to|pics, as foundations of national honour; for|getting Mr. Hume's remark that, "There is not a more effectual method of betraying a cau&s;e, than to lay the &s;tre&s;s of the argument on a wrong place; and by di&s;uting an un|tenable po&s;t, inure the adver&s;aries to &s;ucce&s;s and victory." Thus we have &s;een the anti|quity of our royal line, and the old league with France, maintained as the points of na|tional honour. A Greek or Roman would hardly have boa&s;ted how long they had &s;ub|mitted to one line of kings; or have dream|ed that their nation could po&s;&s;ibly acquire any honour from another. It is likely that the poems of O&s;&s;ian, or an old &s;hoe of St. Margaret, may form our next points, of ho|nour; and that it may be long before our antiqui&s;ts di&s;cover, that our honour is very &s;afe, if they would let it alone. A great nation never &s;peaks of its honour, becau&s;e it de&s;pi&s;es even the &s;u&s;picion of its needing a defence: but, as Algarotti remarks<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pen&s;$eri diver&s;i.</NOTE>, <HI>Gli &s;ci|eli, o vogliam dir coloro the &s;ono dotti per meta, veggono ancora le co&s;e per meta; e ne formano i piu manchevoli e di&s;torti giudizi.</HI></P>

<P>In hi&s;tory it is not allowable for any writer to be an advocate. He ought to be a judge.

It is inconceivable that &s;o may writers, on &s;uch &s;ubjects, &s;hould &s;een to think that their bu|&s;ine&s;s is not to find the truth, but to defend one opinion again&s;t another.

<P>The author, con&s;cious that he has no opi|nions to defend, but that he has embraced what, to his be&s;t judgment and examination, appeared to be the truth, on whatever &s;ide he found it, has employed no art to win the reader to his &s;entiments. On the contrary, his manner is generally &s;o dry, and &s;ome|times &s;o &s;evere, that if the reader finds no conviction in the authorities and arguments, he will never be &s;ubdued by the pomp of declamation, or allured by the arts of elo|quence. If he be convinced, he is convinced by the force of truth only. In perhaps a dozen pa&s;&s;ages of this long work, the reader may, as is not unlikely, even recoil at the rigour, with which &s;ome former writers and opinions are treated. Of &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages the
<PB N="xxviii" REF="27" MS="Y">author is as &s;en&s;ible as the reader: but as he knows and feels their ju&s;tice, he has reviewed them often without either deletion or mitiga|tion. As he always wi&s;hes to avoid giving offence, &s;o he never fears to give it, when truth directs the weapon. Indignation be|longs to virtue, and to &s;cience al&s;o: and is to be exerted again&s;t fal&s;ehood and prejudice, as well as again&s;t vice. Before the reader can properly judge of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, he mu&s;t read the authors again&s;t whom they are directed. If he finds them mode&s;t and veracious, let the blame fall on the unju&s;t anger of the pre&s;ent writer: but if they be found to be dealers in direct fal&s;ehoods, and replete with impudent railing again&s;t the truth, let it be con&s;idered if &s;uck have an exclu&s;ive privilege of being angry. The author has been forced, now and then, to meet them on their own ground; and de&s;erves pity, rather than blame, for that nece&s;&s;ity: which has indeed di&s;gu&s;ted him &s;o far, that he has re&s;olved to abandon the controver&s;ial &s;tyle for ever, and to content him&s;elf, in future, in exploring and vindicating the truth, without arraigning its enemies. But nothing has ob&s;cured the &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent work more than the railing, pride, anger, and fal&s;e a&s;&s;ertions of &s;ome former writers on it. "Now in &s;uch
<PB N="xxix" REF="28" MS="Y">a ca&s;e, even a wi&s;e and mode&s;t man may a&s;&s;ume airs too; and repel in&s;olence with its own weapons. There is a time, as Solomon the wi&s;e&s;t of men teaches us, when 'a fool &s;hould be an&s;wered according to his folly, le&s;t he be wi&s;e in his own conceit;' and le&s;t others too ea&s;ily yield up their faith and rea|&s;on to his imperious dictates<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Watts's Improvement of the Mind.</NOTE>." The rule of Polybius is admirable; "They who in hi&s;|tory relate fal&s;ehoods from ignorance, de&s;erve pardon and benevolent correction: but they who de&s;ignedly commit fal&s;ehoods, are to be condemned without mercy.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lib. xii. A remark of Voltaire is al&s;o applicable: "Il y a des erreurs qu'il faut refuter &s;erieu&s;ment; des ab&s;urdit&eacute;s dont il faut rire; et des fau&s;&s;et&eacute;s qu'il faut repou&s;&s;er avec force."</NOTE>"</P>
<P>This work is however far le&s;s employed in demoli&s;hing fal&s;ehood, than in e&s;tabli&s;h|ing truth. To prove the fallacy of the re|ceived hi&s;tory of Scotland, preceding the year 1056, would have been an ea&s;y ta&s;k by it&s;elf; but to find the true hi&s;tory of that period was difficult. Indolence might ea&s;ily have &s;at down with the impre&s;&s;ion, that, as the received hi&s;tory was fal&s;e, it was impo&s;|&s;ible to find the true; and &s;o Scotland might have pa&s;&s;ed without any hi&s;tory at all, pre|ceding
<PB N="xxx" REF="29">the year 1056; tho every other coun|try can begin its hi&s;tory at the time it was converted to chri&s;tianity, and Scotland was in the fifth and &s;ixth centuries. Nothing indeed could be more ab&s;urd, than to &s;up|po&s;e that a country adjacent to England, and near Ireland, countries that produced many men of letters in the middle ages, &s;hould have no hi&s;tory till the eleventh century; when even Iceland begins in the ninth. Nothing more ab&s;urd than to &s;uppo&s;e that a country, which has hi&s;torical remains of the eleventh century it&s;elf, containing brief ab|&s;tracts of its hi&s;tory preceding that time, &s;hould have no hi&s;tory but from the ele|venth century. The Engli&s;h and Iri&s;h hi&s;to|rians, and our own fragments publi&s;hed by Innes, indeed amply confute received no|tions; &s;o that prejudice, as well as indo|lence, may con&s;pire in this di&s;graceful ab|breviation of our hi&s;tory. Our antiqui&s;ts thus re&s;emble the o&s;trich: they hide their heads, and think nobody &s;ees them. But the fact is, as the reader will find fully di&s;played in this work, that the indolence is contemp|tible, and the prejudice irrational: for it &s;o happens that the real hi&s;tory of Scotland is far more honourable and intere&s;ting, than the fabricated &s;cheme now followed is; even
<PB N="xxxi" REF="30">&s;uppo&s;ing, for a moment, the latter to be true. Had the real hi&s;tory of the country been di&s;graceful to the highe&s;t degree, &s;till it ought to have been given with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous faith; as Rome does not, conceal her de&s;cent from banditti. But when the real hi&s;tory is far more intere&s;ting, as well as more honourable, than the fal&s;e, we mu&s;t from this in&s;tance alone conclude that pre|judice perverts every power of judgment; or that the fact is than indolent ignorance pre|vents the exertion of judgment, by with|holding the materials.</P>

<P>The reader may perhaps find &s;ome matters in this work, which may contradict his preju|dices; but if he will &s;u&s;pend his judgment till he has peru&s;ed the whole, he will find that, by dint of mere indu&s;try, for every forged medal which is withdrawn from the cabinet of Scoti&s;h hi&s;tory, two real ones are put in. An hi&s;torian ought to belong to no country; and in this work the author has laboured to forget that he is a Scoti&s;hman, tho a name he glories in; &s;o that it is hoped no part of this work can fear the accu&s;ation of preju|dice, when examined by a native of any
<PB N="xxxii" REF="31" MS="Y">country in Europe. But far le&s;s is he preju|diced again&s;t his country; and the freedom with which he treats the hi&s;tory of all &s;ur|rounding kingdoms, may warrant him from any &s;uch imputation. It was &s;aid of Thucy|dides, that from his hi&s;tory it could not be known whether he belonged to Athens or Sparta; and it is hoped the national bias of this work is not very &s;trong. The vulgar pa&s;&s;ion for one's country is a mere modifica|tion of &s;elf-love; but the real patriot wi&s;hes to promote the genuine well-fare of his country, not to feed his own little vanity; and that well-fare is be&s;t promoted by point|ing out faults that they may be amended. To prai&s;e one's country is to prai&s;e one's &s;elf; and Europe is now &s;o civilized, that the voice of &s;trangers is the &s;ure&s;t e&s;timate of a country's fame.</P>
<P>One grand cau&s;e of the neglect of Scoti&s;h hi&s;tory is the ab&s;urd idea, which many among us have, of the nature of the original hi&s;torians of other countries. The little chronicles, publi&s;hed by Innes, are as full as &s;everal other nations can boa&s;t of for their earlie&s;t hi&s;tory. Even Spain has only the chronicles of I&s;idorus, and John of Biclair; which are &s;horter and not larger than ours.
<PB N="xxxiii" REF="32" MS="Y">The original chronicles of Denmark are ex|actly of the &s;ame brief kind, as may be &s;een in the fir&s;t volume of Langebek's Collection. But our writers &s;eem ludicrou&s;ly to expect that Scotland &s;hould vye with Italy, France, Germany, or England, in early hi&s;torians. Such ignorance is only excu&s;able in a people &s;hut up in a corner of an iland; and inca|pable of comparing them&s;elves with others. Ignorance always begets pride: but Den|mark might as well compare her&s;elf with Germany; or Swizzerland with Italy; as Scotland with England. In the grand com|monwealth of Europe it is now perfectly under&s;tood that Scotland is the poore&s;t &s;tate, and England one of the riche&s;t. Denmark and Sweden have, each of them, double the wealth, power, and population, that Scotland has, or ever had. Even Norway is remark|able for her conque&s;ts, and colonies, cele|brated all over Europe; while Scotland is only remarkable for defen&s;ive war. But our writers ab&s;urdly expect advantages, which nature has denied; as if flattery could make a mountainous country populous, and fer|tile; or turn a remote corner round to the centre of civilization! As they &s;ee no coun|try but England, they facetiou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;e that, becau&s;e England has many ancient
<PB N="xxxiv" REF="33">writers, Scotland mu&s;t al&s;o have had, tho now lo&s;t. Hence the &s;tory of chronicles de&s;troyed by Edward I. tho it ought fir&s;t to have been proved that &s;uch chronicles ever exi&s;ted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This opinion however is as old as the fifteenth century. See Innes, p. 555. But it only aro&s;e from national enmity, and is confutable from the li&s;ts of the writings which Edward &s;eized being pre&s;erved in the Tower, and publi&s;hed by Ayloffe, &amp;c.</NOTE>. Certain it is that, if they had, their memory could not have peri&s;hed with them; but as not one can be conde&s;cended on, there is rea&s;on to infer that they did not exi&s;t. And in fact the pieces publi&s;hed by Innes, written in the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries, the Chronicle of Mel|ro&s;e in the thirteenth, pre&s;ent a &s;eries of ori|ginal hi&s;tory, equal to any that could rea|&s;onably be expected, for a country &s;o remote, and &s;o lately civilized. Our writers would do well to look into the original hi&s;torians of other nations. They will find that Ire|land has only Tighernach, who wrote in 1088: Denmark only &s;uch brief chronicles as ours, prior to that miracle, Saxo Gram|maticus, a cla&s;&s;ic writer in 1180: Sweden no native writer, till the fourteenth century, when a chronicle in rime, like our Win|ton's, was written: Norway the brief chro|nicle
<PB N="xxxv" REF="34">of Theodoric the monk, written about 1178. Bohemia has only Co&s;mas of Prague, 1126: Pru&s;&s;ia, Helmoldus 1180: Poland, Kadlubko 1223: and the earlie&s;t hi&s;torian of Ru&s;&s;ia is Ne&s;tor, 1115. Nay &s;ome more &s;outhern countries have as few, and as late hi&s;torians. The Low Countries, that garden of Europe, can boa&s;t of none till the 15th century. Spain has, after I&s;idorus and John of Biclair, in the 7th century, only the chronicles of the four bi&s;hops written in the 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th centuries, and publi&s;hed by Sandoval at Pampelona, 1634, folio. Roderic of Toledo, the fir&s;t Spani&s;h general hi&s;torian, wrote in 1243<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of the original hi&s;torians of all nations, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that Fordun is by far the mo&s;t prolix, and the weake&s;t in every view.</NOTE>. On a fair compari&s;on Scotland has at lea&s;t as many hi&s;torical pieces extant, as fall to her &s;hare: and if Edward I. adopted the new and wild &s;cheme of de&s;troying her chronicles, he mu&s;t have done it to little purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>But a peculiar glory which di&s;tingui&s;hes the hi&s;tory of Scotland, from that of other northern kingdoms, is that the earlie&s;t pe|riod of it &s;tands on Greek and Roman au|thorities. Another advantage is that the
<PB N="xxxvi" REF="35" MS="Y">next period is confirmed by the te&s;timonies of Engli&s;h and Iri&s;h writers. Among the later Adomnan has given us the life of St. Columba, the chief apo&s;tle of North Britain, written about the year 680; one of the mo&s;t curious monuments of the literature of that age. It is certainly the mo&s;t complete piece of &s;uch biography that all Europe can boa&s;t of, not only at &s;o early a period, but even thro the whole middle ages. The lives of &s;aints, formerly only cen&s;idered in a religi|ous view, now begin to be regarded in an hi&s;torical light, by mo&s;t countries, whether papi&s;t or prote&s;tant. Du Che&s;ne, in his Col|lection of French Hi&s;torians, gave extracts of the old lives of &s;aints; an example fol|lowed in Bouquet's late celebrated work of the &s;ame kind. Langebek, in his Collection of Dani&s;h Hi&s;torians, follows the &s;ame plan; and the life of St. Am&s;gar, 820, is to Scan|dinavia, what that of Sr. Columba is to Scot|land. Our antiqui&s;ts, with all the pride of ignorance, may perhaps affect to de&s;pi&s;e mo|numents which, hi&s;torically con&s;idered, have received the &s;anction of Monte&s;quieu and Gibbon. But the fal&s;ehood, of the miracles no more affects the hi&s;torical, and topogra|phic parts, than the miracles of Livy and Tacitus di&s;credit their hi&s;tory. Not to in&s;i&s;t
<PB N="xxxvii" REF="36" MS="Y">on a matter now &s;o well known to the learned, as the value of the&s;e old lives, in the hi&s;tory of the middle ages, it &s;hall be further ob&s;erved, that many of them are well written; and are curious monuments, not only of the literature, but of the man|ners of the times. Sulpitius Severus &s;et the example of them in his life of St. Martin, written in the fifth century: and, for five or &s;ix centuries, his example was followed in all countries by the mo&s;t able writers of each age. But after that period, in&s;tead of cotemporary writers of only one life, compilers began to appear, who altered the old writings to their fancy, and produced mon&s;trous romances; as the Golden Legend, written in the thir|teenth century, and others of that &s;tamp. Romances being then the fa&s;hion, &s;aints and knights-errant went hand in hand thro the regions of ab&s;urdity. As literature revived, both fell together. But the genuine old lives of &s;aints began to be recovered in a pious view; and Mombritius in 1480 &s;et the fir&s;t example of a legitimate collection of this kind followed by Lippomanus and by Surius about 1560; and in the next century by the famous Bollandi&s;ts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">So called becau&s;e Bollandus began this great col|lection, which was continued by Hen&s;chenius, Pape|broch, Sollerius, Cuper, Hilting, and many others.</NOTE>, who&s;e work from 1643
<PB N="xxxviii" REF="37" MS="Y">to 1786 fills fifty folio volumes; and &s;till, the &s;aints of November and December are wanting, which will take ten volumes more.</P>
<P>In dige&s;ting this work, the author has been careful to admit no authority, or argu|ment, but &s;uch as would be allowed valid, if applied to the hi&s;tory of any country whatever. Yet to &s;ome the novelty, which it contains, may appear &s;u&s;picious. To &s;uch it can only be an&s;wered that, if the original authorities, and real hi&s;tory, of any country have been neglected for late fables, the truth which is very old, mu&s;t appear very new, when revived. The truth is always old, tho the di&s;covery may be new. Monte&s;quieu ob&s;erves, when illu&s;trating French antiqui|ties, <HI>Je &s;ais bien que je dis ici des cho&s;es nou|velles: mais, &s;i elles &s;ont vraies, elles &s;ont tres anciennes.</HI> As Ireland's claim to the <HI>Scotia</HI> and <HI>Scoti,</HI> preceding the eleventh century, has been long allowed and e&s;tabli&s;hed among the literati of all countries; and Scotland mu&s;t have had &s;ome name, and &s;ome inhabi|tans, before that period, it became nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;cover what they were. Our writers &s;eemed to &s;hrink from the enquiry; none of them, in the words of Homer,</P>

<P>The author has attempted to &s;ettle this af|fair; and to redeem the early hi&s;tory of his country from total annihilation. Regret at his own ignorance in the matter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His ignorance was &s;uch that, in the Di&s;&s;ertations prefixed to Select Scoti&s;h Ballads, written 1776, and fir&s;t printed at London 1781, he rather a&s;&s;erts the au|thenticity of O&s;&s;ian. And in the E&s;&s;ay on the Origin of Scoti&s;h Poetry, prefixed to Ancient Scoti&s;h Poems from the Maitland MS. written 1784, publi&s;hed 1786, there are &s;everal opinions which a full and complete examination, of all the evidences of early Scoti&s;h Hi&s;|tory, has forced him to condemn in the pre&s;ent work. But the reader, upon recour&s;e to the&s;e former produc|tions, will acquit the author of prejudice; and &s;ee the truth, which is that he has conquered his own preju|dice. He hopes he may &s;ay with Baldus, "Ignorantiae inimicus alienae, INIMICISSIMUS SUAE, paratus corrigi a quocunque, et correctiones patiens libenti et humili animo, quia ignorare non e&s;t vitium, &s;ed natura."</NOTE>, was in|deed one great &s;pur to the de&s;ign. Truth may appear &s;ingular, to tho&s;e who are accu&s;|tomed to fal&s;ehood. But, as a more con|temptible character cannot exi&s;t, than his who would &s;acrifice truth and &s;cience to a &s;illy love of &s;ingularity; &s;o no man ought to fear the charge of &s;ingularity, when a&s;&s;erting the cau&s;e of truth. Mankind can never be &s;erved with impunity; and the charge of &s;ingularity has at fir&s;t lain again&s;t every man, who has advanced the progre&s;s of any
<PB N="xl" REF="39">&s;cience. Torfaeus was per&s;ecuted by his co|temporaries for reforming the fables of Saxo, who had taken kings of Jutland, Sweden, Ru&s;&s;ia, for Dani&s;h &s;overeigns. In the next generation prejudice, envy, and malice were chained to his tomb; and the voice of fame followed the light of truth.</P>
<Q>Omnia &s;ub&s;ident meliori pervia cau&s;ae.</Q>
<P>Before this preface be clo&s;ed the reader mu&s;t be informed, that it is the author's in|tention, to give a regular hi&s;tory of Scotland from the earlie&s;t accounts till the reign of Mary, in two volumes, quarto, divided into forty books. But as he wi&s;hed to exert the utmo&s;t care in this work, he was induced to publi&s;h this Enquiry into the ob&s;cure and controverted period of Scoti&s;h hi&s;tory, in the fir&s;t place, that he might hear the opinion of the learned, and correct his mi&s;takes before they pa&s;&s;ed into a more &s;olemn work. As the nature of hi&s;tory rejects controver&s;y, and implies a dignified narration of events, not as told in different ways, but as they really happened to the be&s;t of the hi&s;torian's exa|mination, it &s;eemed al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary, by a pre|vious work, to remove all occa&s;ion of con|trover&s;y from the hi&s;tory it&s;elf; as the reader by one reference to this work, may examine
<PB N="xli" REF="40">the whole rea&s;ons for the hi&s;torical narration at his lei&s;ure, if he &s;ees fit. This propo&s;ed hi&s;tory will be a work of years; and in the mean time the author will be happy to at|tend to any &s;trictures on the pre&s;ent work; and either to confirm his &s;entiments, where he may &s;till think them ju&s;t, or to retract them where erroneous. He knows he has &s;till much to learn; and is re&s;olved never to lock up the little ca&s;ket of his knowlege, but to keep it open for fre&s;h acce&s;&s;ions from all quarters.</P>
<P>The reader is intreated to pardon a verbal remark, before proceeding to the work. He will find in it the people called <HI>Picti</HI> by the Romans, always denominated <HI>Piks,</HI> and not <HI>Picts</HI> as u&s;ual. Rea&s;ons for this little change were, that the Latin term <HI>Picti,</HI> too nearly tran&s;lated <HI>Picts,</HI> has a double meaning, which has given ri&s;e to a great error; to wit that the name of this people is not indigenal, but a mere Latin epithet, from their paint|ing them&s;elves. Whereas it is merely an in|digenal name, <HI>Pihtar,</HI> Latinized. The Saxon writers call them <HI>Pihtas, Pyhtas, Pehtas, Peohtas;</HI> the old Scoti&s;h, and the people of Scotland, to this day, <HI>Pihts</HI> or <HI>Pehts.</HI> The <HI>ht</HI> being har&s;h, the Romans gave for it <HI>ct,</HI>

To mark the name as indigenal, and foreign to the Latin language, it was thought be&s;t to write it <HI>Piks;</HI> a change which it is hoped the reader will excu&s;e, if not approve. The name <HI>Picts</HI> is in fact quite a modern term, not much above a century old; and the fault lies with tho&s;e who in|troduced this new and improper way of &s;pelling, and not with the author, who only &s;oftens the term u&s;ed even in the &s;ixteenth century, namely <HI>Pihts.</HI> In Icelandic, the old language of Scandinavia, whence this people came, the &s;ingular is <HI>Piki,</HI> a Pik, the plural <HI>Pikir</HI> Piks; as <HI>Griki</HI> is a Greek, <HI>Grikir</HI> Greeks.</P>
<P>The Di&s;&s;ertation on the Origin and Pro|gre&s;s of the Scythians or Goths, which was publi&s;hed near two years ago, was originally intended as part of this work, as the reader will find on looking into it. But as many readers may not perhaps chu&s;e to begin their

<P>This preface ought to be clo&s;ed with ac|knowlegements to many literati of different countries, to whom the author is obliged for articles of information.

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Containing a &s;uccinct view of what has been done in Scoti&s;h Antiquities.</HEAD>
<P>TILL the beginning of this century the &s;tudy of antiquities, far from making any progre&s;s in Scotland, was hardly known in that country. Italy, Spain, France, Germany, had produced eminent antiquaries in the &s;ixteenth century: and in the next, Hungary, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, could boa&s;t of &s;everal. Remote &s;ituation, and the con&s;equent want of emulation; penury, and the con&s;equent want of books and learned lei&s;ure; were cau&s;es that long checked the birth and growth of this,
<PB N="xlvi" REF="44">as well as of the other &s;ciences, in Scotland. The &s;trange &s;pirit of fanatici&s;m, which in the &s;eventeenth century pervaded the coun|try, was another grand cau&s;e of the neglect of literature; for every &s;tudy, not relating to religion, was regarded as &s;uperfluous, if not profane: but this &s;econdary cau&s;e al&s;o originated from penury, as they who are mi&s;erable in this life naturally turn all their views to another; and it will be difficult to name a happy and flouri&s;hing country, in which fanatici&s;m makes any progre&s;s. Eng|land was in the horrors of civil war, be|fore fanatici&s;m prevailed; and the mo&s;t fa|natic religion, the Mahometan, originated in the de&s;erts of Arabia. Spain, at pre&s;ent one of the poore&s;t countries, is al&s;o one of the mo&s;t fanatic. It &s;eems certain that the chief fountain of the great deficiency in Scoti&s;h literature, during the la&s;t century, proceeded from the religious ferment, which pervaded all ranks, and induced a contempt and neglect of every art and &s;cience.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s two men aro&s;e who paid &s;ome attention to the antiquities of their country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the &s;ixteenth century Major, Boyce, Le&s;ly, and Buchanan, are well known; Lluyd, a Welchman, at|tacked Boyce's fables, and Camden gave his &s;hort de|&s;cription of Scotland.

<P>In the next, or &s;eventeenth century, &s;everal treati&s;es on Scoti&s;h antiquities were written by Drummond, Crawford, David Buchanan, David Hume, Sir James Balfour, Sir Robert Sibbald, &amp;c. and tho they all fol|low the fabulous &s;cheme of our hi&s;tory, a publica|tion of the be&s;t would be acceptable.

The fir&s;t was Sir ROBERT GOR|DON
<PB N="xlvii" REF="45" MS="Y">of Straloch, who, about the year 1650, wrote &s;ome &s;craps on our antiquities, pre|&s;erved in the noble <HI>Atlas Scotiae,</HI> begun at the expence of Sir JOHN SCOTT of Scots Tar|vet, Director of the Chancery, and publi&s;hed by Bleau at Am&s;terdam. There is al&s;o a curious letter on our hi&s;torians, written by Sir R. Gordon to David Buchanan, 1649, often quoted by Nicol&s;on, in his Scoti&s;h Hi&s;torical Library; and publi&s;hed by Hearne in the Prolegomena to Leland's Collectanea. From this letter it appears that Gordon had a due contempt for the fables of Boyce and Buchanan, then generally received among
<PB N="xlviii" REF="46" MS="Y">his countrymen, a circum&s;tance which &s;ays much for his &s;agacity and candour.</P>
<P>The next writer was Sir ROBERT SIB|BALD, who&s;e works appeared from 1680 till 1700; and who had the true &s;pirit and in|du&s;try of an antiquary, tho no great &s;agacity nor abilities. Many of his works are in print, and are curious, and &s;ometimes va|luable. The collections he formed in his library of various MSS. concerning Scoti&s;h antiquities, written by him&s;elf and others, were &s;ufficient to procure him the ju&s;t fame of an antiquary.

The collections of Graevius and Gronovius, relating to Greek and Roman antiquities, afford a model; but two or three volumes folio might contain all the Scoti&s;h.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>During the &s;ame period the ancient hi&s;|tory of Scotland (the chief object of an an|tiquary), which had hitherto been &s;uffered to remain as Fordun, Boyce, and Buchanan, had thought proper to forge it, began for the fir&s;t time to incur critical examination.
<PB N="xlix" REF="47">Sir Robert Gordon had expre&s;t doubts and di&s;belief; but unhappily did not publi&s;h a &s;pecial work on the &s;ubject. Sibbald, in his hi&s;tory of Fife, al&s;o differed from received fables, in &s;uppo&s;ing the Piks not extirpated, but really the Lowlanders, and their lan|guage the Lowlandi&s;h. Yet it &s;o happened that the Engli&s;h writers, who had ju&s;t be|gun to reject the fables of Geofrey of Mon|mouth, now had occa&s;ion to critici&s;e the Scoti&s;h fables. U&s;her indeed, in his Anti|quities of the Briti&s;h churches, publi&s;hed in 1639, had led the way; but the civil com|motions that followed, prevented any atten|tion being paid to &s;uch &s;ubjects. Now that quiet prevailed, the revival of his arguments by Bi&s;hops Lloyd and Stillingfleet; and the publication of O'Flaherty's Ogygia in 1685; rai&s;ed a &s;trange flame among the Scoti&s;h writers. National enmity, and prejudice, made truths very unacceptable, which if they had originated among them&s;elves, would at lea&s;t have been more gracious; tho the fir&s;t reception of truth, when op|po&s;ed to ancient prejudices, in all ages and countries, has never been favourable. Sir George Mackenzie, king's Advocate for Scotland, in an odd fit of &s;cribling chivalry, thought it a duty of his office to defend the
<PB N="l" REF="48" MS="Y">enchanted ca&s;tle of old fable; and with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Sir Robert Sibbald, and Sir James Dalrymple, publi&s;hed his Defence of the Antiquity of the Royal line of Scotland, in two parts, 1685, 1686; afterward tran&s;|lated into Latin, and publi&s;hed together in Holland. This book, founded on a crazy idea that the honour of Scotland depended on the antiquity of its royal line, may be regarded as an omen in what manner Scoti&s;h antiquities were to be treated, in contradi&s;|tinction to tho&s;e of other countries. In&s;tead of &s;olid facts, founded on ancient authorities, which con&s;titute the &s;ole difference between hi&s;tory and romance, it contains arguments of ab&s;urd ingenuity, &s;upported by the mo&s;t trifling and puerile reading, with here and there a cunning quibble. Sir George &s;eems incapable of that common degree of candour, which &s;uppo&s;es it po&s;&s;ible that the truth may be on the other &s;ide; and he argues as an advocate for a cau&s;e, not as a philo&s;opher who wi&s;hes only to find out where the truth lyes. <HI>Fas e&s;t et ab ho&s;te doceri,</HI> was a maxim unknown to this writer: and the brevity of his trifling tracts might have &s;tared him in the face, with the old adage, <HI>Qui pauca con&s;iderat, de facili pronunciat.</HI></P>
<PB N="li" REF="49" MS="Y">
<P>However a ferment of doubt was now thrown into the ancient hi&s;tory, of Scotland, which was in time to make it run, off clearer and clearer, while the dregs of fable &s;unk to the bottom. And the eighteenth cen|tury, as glorious for Scoti&s;h literature, as the preceding had been adver&s;e, was to throw all po&s;&s;ible light on our ancient hi&s;|tory. Here then a more regular and ample account &s;hall begin.</P>

<P>NICOLSON'S Scoti&s;h Hi&s;torical Library appeared; and was a mo&s;t u&s;eful work to &s;hew us what had been done for our hi&s;|tory, and to encourage us to new efforts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This work is not however without gro&s;s mi&s;takes, &s;uch as his confounding St. Columba with St. Co|lumban; his putting David Hume's Hi&s;tory of Scot|land, Edin. 1617, London, 1657, as a different work from his Hi&s;tory of the Hou&s;e of Douglas and Angus, while it is the &s;ame work with a fooli&s;h title, &amp;c.</NOTE>.

<P>Sir JAMES DALRYMPLE'S Collections con|cerning Scoti&s;h Hi&s;tory preceding the year

In his violent pre&s;byteriani&s;m he wi&s;hes to prove that no bi&s;hops appeared in Scotland, till the eleventh century, and that the Culdees were Pre&s;byterians. Mr. Gibbon ob&s;erves that the ancient Chri&s;tians were as little Prote&s;tants as they were Pa|pi&s;ts; and it may be here remarked that the Culdees were as little Pre&s;byterians, as they were Hierarchi&s;ts. They elected bi&s;hops among them&s;elves; but a bi&s;hop of the Cul|dees was neither a Pre&s;byter, nor a bi&s;hop in the modern &s;en&s;e. It is one great ta&s;k of an antiquary to &s;eparate ideas from words.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame year was publi&s;hed ANDER|SON'S E&s;&s;ay on the independency of Scot|land, a laudable work for the time.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame year appeared at Paris, KENNEDY'S Chronological, Genealogical, and Hi&s;torical Di&s;&s;ertation on the Royal Fa|mily of the Stuarts. This little work, by an Iri&s;h writer, contains all that part of the fabulous hi&s;tory of Ireland, which relates to the ance&s;tors of Fergus I. and is a good abridgment. But the author's idea, that

<P>1708,</P>
<P>Dr. MACKENZIE'S Lives of the Scoti&s;h writers, vol. I. was publi&s;hed, and was pro|po&s;ed to be completed in another volume. But the author's avarice led him to &s;well his work to two volumes more; and a fourth was &s;till wanting to complete it. The fir&s;t volume, which goes down to the year 1500, is by far the be&s;t; but has nu|merous <HI>Scoti</HI> of Ireland, who wrote many centuries before Scotland could boa&s;t of any writer, having not one native author till the thirteenth century, as Denmark has none till the twelfth, nor Sweden till the four|teenth. The whole work is remarkably dull, erroneous, and ill-written, but has &s;ome good materials. In the preface to vol.

<P>In the &s;ame year SCOTT'S Hi&s;tory of Scot|land was publi&s;hed in folio. A weak work of no name.</P>
<P>1729,</P>
<P>INNES'S invaluable E&s;&s;ay on the Ancient Inhabitants of Scotland, &amp;c. appeared, in two volumes 4to and 8vo. This work forms a grand epoch in our antiquities; and was the fir&s;t that led the way to rational critici&s;m on them. It is not however with|out
<PB N="lvi" REF="54" MS="Y">out faults; of which a radical one is the imagination that the Piks were of one race with the Welch, and u&s;ed the Welch lan|guage; in which the author was mi&s;led by Camden, and by Lloyd. Another gro&s;s fault is his wa&s;ting 150 pages upon the contro|ver&s;y concerning Mary, Buchanan's prin|ciples, &amp;c. from p. 255 of vol. I. to the end. This was foreign to his work, and di&s;tracting to the reader by loading difficult &s;ubjects with another extraneous difficult one. It was al&s;o written "in a very great hurry to keep pace with the pre&s;s," as he tells us, preface p. xxxiv. and &s;mells of that hurry. It is really &s;urprizing that &s;o judi|cious and cool a writer could have been &s;o ab&s;urd, as to load his work with &s;uch &s;tuff. His manner of divi&s;ion into books, chapters, and articles, &s;ections, and di&s;&s;ertations, is al&s;o ob&s;cure and indi&s;tinct.</P>
<P>His greate&s;t merit lies in publi&s;hing the old Chronicles, and other remains of our hi&s;tory. But he is not very accurate, as the reader will find in the collation of his edi|tion with the originals, at the end of this volume. However his indu&s;try, coolne&s;s, judgment, and general accuracy, recom|mend him as the be&s;t antiquary that Scot|land

<P>From p. 725, 728, 760, it appears that he intended a &s;econd part, concerning the Eccle&s;ia&s;tic Hi&s;tory of Scotland. Tho it may ea&s;ily be &s;een to what &s;ide he would incline, yet there is great room to regret that he did not publi&s;h this &s;econd part: and that in the fir&s;t, tho he gives a chrono|logy of the Piki&s;h kings to the year 843, yet he goes no lower than Fergus I. 503. The main part of his work is occupied in &s;hewing that the Old Scots did not come to Britain, till the third century, and had no kings till Fergus, A. D. 503. His long account of the Scoti&s;h Hi&s;torians is exact, curious, and intere&s;ting<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A &s;illy pamphlet in an&s;wer to Innes was, pub|li&s;hed at Edin. 1733, 4to, pp. 32: and one Tait wrote another in 12mo.

<P>KEITH'S Catalogue of Scoti&s;h Bi&s;hops was publi&s;hed in 4to. A laudable work, had not the author been too hot.

Angry and hot is Maitland; but his work, &s;acred to Vulcan, is not only hot, but lame. He is a bitter enemy of Innes, of Ireland, of the Piks, and of him&s;elf. He however abandons the kings prior to Fergus, who&s;e reign he dates 403, by a blunder of a cen|tury. But who &s;hall blame him; for what did he know of the matter? His remarks on Ro|man antiquities in Scotland, which he in&s;pected him&s;elf, are curious; but the re&s;t of his work confu&s;ed, illiterate, inaccurate, and deficient in common information.</P>

He talks like a ma&s;ter, where he is not even a &s;cholar; and dreams he knows every thing, when he knows nothing.

<PB N="lxvi" REF="64">their friends. But the ignorance of the Lowlanders them&s;elves, concerning their hi&s;tory, left room for this attack, as the &s;ick lion could not defend him&s;elf from the kick of an a&s;s. Had we ever produced a Sigo|nius, a Du Cange, a Muratori, or even a Torfaeus, the&s;e, puerile writers would have trembled as &s;chool-boys before their ma&s;ter. Science would have laughed at the phan|toms of opinion.</P>
<P>Were any writer to ari&s;e in the High|lands, who would not pretend to confute ancient authorities upon no authority at all, but his own dreams; who would allow the Iri&s;h extract of the Highlanders, and peru&s;e Iri&s;h MSS. in order to throw light on their hi&s;tory and antiquities by faithful tran&s;la|tions; who would &s;tudy Scandinavian anti|quites, as the Norwegians were lords of the Highlands and iles from the ninth century, and remain &s;till in their progeny; he would de&s;erve great prai&s;e. After the favourable reception of O&s;&s;ian, it would be ri&s;ible to accu&s;e the Lowlanders of prejudice on their part. But to extingui&s;h all hi&s;tory and men|tion of the Lowlanders vas pu&s;hing the je&s;t too far; e&s;pecially as not one name of a Highlander is to be found in the whole hi&s;|tory
<PB N="lxvii" REF="65">of Scotland after the year 1056<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That is in &s;olemn narration; for, in minuter an|nals and memoirs, they are mentioned as concerned in thefts and riots. During the la&s;t and pre&s;ent century, they have been dreaded by the Lowlanders, as all ci|vilized nations fear &s;avages. But barbarous cu&s;toms, and uncouth ferocity, are very different from courage; a party of &s;avages might pierce thro any civilized king|dom, and conquer till their opponents were accu&s;tomed to their &s;ingular mode of fighting. The Maca&s;&s;ars, and Wild Americans, afford many proofs of this.</NOTE>. The Highlanders were not indeed even &s;ubject to the Scoti&s;h crown, from the ninth to the &s;ixteenth century, but to the Norwegian lords: &s;o that their mode&s;ty, in taking all our hi&s;tory to them&s;elves, exceeds all pa|rallel.</P>

<P>Mr. WHITAKER'S Genuine Hi&s;tory of the Britons, in an&s;wer to Mr. Macpher&s;on, came to light. As Mr. M. dealed only in <HI>a&s;&s;er|tion,</HI> the only an&s;wer required was <HI>denial.</HI> But as Mr. W. pretended to be Welch, and Mr. M. to be a real Highlander, the match was fair.</P>

<P>Sir DAVID DALRYMPLE, Lord Hailes, publi&s;hed the fir&s;t volume of his Annals of Scotland; and the &s;econd followed in 1779. They comprize the period from 1056 to 1371; and are written with an accuracy and information hitherto unknown in our hi&s;tory. This excellent writer had before given &s;undry &s;maller works, illu&s;trating our hi&s;tory and antiquities, all of which are highly e&s;teemed for the candour, love of truth, exactne&s;s and indu&s;try, which per|vade them. It is much to be regretted that he did not continue his Annals, and it is impo&s;&s;ible to gue&s;s at the rea&s;on of the in|terruption, except that &s;ome malignant &s;tar &s;eems to influence Scoti&s;h hi&s;tory and anti|quities. But three centuries of our hi&s;tory, illu&s;trated by Sir David Dalrymple, form a great and plea&s;ing acqui&s;ition.</P>
<P>1780.</P>
<P>SMITH'S Gaelic Antiquities appeared; a laudable work, as collecting Highland manners and cu&s;toms: but the author often takes common Norwegian matters for Druidic, as he calls them. It re|mains
<PB N="lxix" REF="67" MS="Y">to be proved that there ever was a Druid in the Highlands; and we mu&s;t not abu&s;e the privilege which antiquaries have of dreaming. But this author is far more moderate, and hone&s;t, than the Mac|pher&s;ons.</P>
<P>1786.</P>
<P>John&s;ton's <HI>Antiquitates Celto-Scandicae,</HI> &amp;c. were printed at Copenhagen, in two vo|lumes, 4to. containing extracts from the Icelandic writers concerning Britain and Ire|land. An acceptable work; but which is defective in illu&s;tration, and in accuracy.</P>

<P>WHEN the fir&s;t dawn of Grecian &s;cience ri&s;es upon the we&s;t of Europe, in the time of Herodotus, we find that this writer calls the ilands of Britain and Ireland CASSI|TERIDES, a name implying the <HI>iles of tin</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Herodot. III. 115. <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> is derived from <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>me|retrix,</HI> being chiefly u&s;ed at fir&s;t as mock &s;ilver, for ornaments to &s;uch.</NOTE>. For the Phoenicians traded hither for that metal, from their &s;ettlements in Africa and Spain; and from hence alone the ancient world was &s;upplied with it, whence Ari&s;totle<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">De mir. au&s;c. &s;i Ari&s;totelis &s;it.</NOTE> calls it in general <HI>Celtic tin,</HI> as the we&s;t of Gaul and of Britain was &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
<PB N="4" REF="89">by the Celts, the ancient inhabitants of Europe. This name Ca&s;&s;iterides was afterward improperly, given to the iles of Scilly, which were far too mi|nute to attract Grecian notice; and it is agreed by the learned<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">See Huet, Commerce des Anciens.</NOTE> that it was originally, and properly, given to Britain and Ireland.</P>
<P>Herodotus, who wrote about 450 years before Chri&s;t, only hints a very faint knowlege of the Ca&s;&s;iterides: and as the Phoenicians, according to Strabo's<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Lib. III.</NOTE> report, carefully concealed their acquain|tance with the we&s;t of Europe, le&s;t other nations &s;hould interfere in their trade, this knowlege was not encrea&s;ed for a long time. For Polybius, a well informed writer, who lived about 170 years before Chri&s;t, tells us<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Polyb. lib. III.</NOTE> that, in his time, all that part of Europe north of an oblique line, to be drawn from the Tanais to the head of the Rhone, or extremity of <HI>Gallia Bracata,</HI> afterward <HI>Nar|bonen&s;is,</HI> was quite unknown. That is, all Ru&s;&s;ia, Poland, Germany, three quarters of Gaul, Bri|tain, Ireland, and Scandinavia. This ignorance remained till Cae&s;ar entered on his province of Gaul, 57 years before Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>My re&s;earches being confined to Scotland, no notice &s;hall be taken of the de&s;criptions of the &s;outh of Britain by Cae&s;ar, who attacked it 53 years be|fore our aera. With regard to the north, he only ob|&s;erves<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">De Bello Gall. lib. V.</NOTE>, after mentioning that Britain is triangular, the &s;outh &s;ide lying toward Gaul, the we&s;t toward Spain, and Hibernia or Ireland, that the north &s;ide, as he calls it, fronts the ocean with it's angle bent toward Germany. He de&s;cribes the length of this &s;ide, or of Britain, as about 800 miles, being about 100 more than the truth. His geo|graphy of Britain is &s;o perverted, that he mi&s;takes the ea&s;t for the north; but the ancients had &s;o few
<PB N="5" REF="90">means of cultivating geography, that it is matter of wonder, that they made &s;o few errors, not that they made &s;o many. Cae&s;ar's idea of Britain was this: a triangular ile, who&s;e &s;horte&s;t &s;ide oppo&s;ite to Gaul, or fronting &s;outh-ea&s;t, as he thought, was 500 miles long; the next fronting we&s;t to Ireland and to Spain, as then imagined, had 700 miles; the third fronting north-ea&s;t, it's &s;outh mo&s;t part oppo&s;ite Germany, the re&s;t viewing only the va&s;t ocean, had 800 miles. To acquire accurate ideas of ancient knowlege, we mu&s;t lay a&s;ide our own, and think, for the moment, as the ancients did; for if we allow nothing for their ignorance, but re|fer their ideas to our &s;tandard, confu&s;ion will ari&s;e in&s;tead of accuracy.</P>
<P>Diodorus Siculus lived in the time of Julius, and is &s;aid to have died very old, toward the middle of the reign of Augu&s;tus. He has a &s;hort de&s;cription of Britain; and certainly profited by the di&s;coveries of Julius. He tells us<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Lib.

</LIST> This is the very fir&s;t mention of any place in Scotland by any writer. Gaul being &s;ubjected to the Roman em|pire, by Julius Cae&s;ar, all provincial benefits were &s;peedily extended to it. Many Romans &s;ettled there; and no doubt &s;ome applied them&s;elves to merchandize. Hence di&s;coveries were often made with re&s;pect to neighbouring countries. Diodorus
<PB N="6" REF="91" MS="Y">heard the&s;e di&s;coveries; and thus mentions the mo&s;t northern point of Britain by name, tho un|known to Julius.</P>
<P>Far other was the ca&s;e with Strabo, who lived under Tiberius about 20 years after Chri&s;t, but &s;eems never to have been beyond Cappadocia, his native country. Tho a &s;en&s;ible and valuable wri|ter, he &s;hews &s;uch gro&s;s ignorance of countries ju&s;t around him, as to take the Ca&s;pian &s;ea for a va&s;t gulf of the great Northern Ocean, tho it be a lake near 1000 miles from it; and he brands Herodotus as a fabuli&s;t, who however knew the Ca&s;pian was a great lake, and is in geography more veracious than Strabo him&s;elf, tho he wrote 500 years be|fore. This &s;ays very little for Strabo's information on a country &s;o near him; and with regard to Britain and Ireland, as va&s;tly more di&s;tant from him, no wonder that it is erroneous. In his de|&s;cription of Britain, to be found in his Fourth Book, he joins with former writers in con&s;idering it as triangular; but &s;ays each &s;ide has about 4300 &s;tadia in length, that is, allowing eight &s;tadia to a mile, 537&frac12; miles. In book II. p. 128, he &s;ays, the length of that &s;ide of Britain which faces Gaul, is 5000 &s;tadia, or 625 miles. In book II. p. 72, he &s;ays Ireland is 5000 &s;tadia from France, that is, 625 miles, while in fact that di&s;tance does not exceed 100! Book I. p. 63. he &s;ays, from Mar|&s;eilles to the middle of Britain are 5000 &s;tadia, or 625 miles; while France is about 500 miles broad, and the middle of Britain would, according to Cae&s;ar's computation, who puts it 800 miles long, take 400 miles more. In another pa&s;&s;age of book I. he infers the di&s;tance from Mar&s;eilles to Ireland to be 12,200 &s;tadia, or 1525 miles! Ca&s;aubon has well remarked, that Strabo's geography of Britain and Ireland is inaccurate, incon&s;i&s;tent, and &s;elf-contradictory. In &s;hort, we can only &s;ay, that he knew nothing either of Britain or Ireland; and that, con&s;idering his di&s;tance, it is no wonder he
<PB N="7" REF="92" MS="Y">did not. But his grand and prodigious error, and in which as he followed no writer, &s;o he is followed by none, is his placing Hibernia, or Ireland, <HI>north</HI> of Albion, or Britain<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Goodal, in his Introduction to Fordun, cap. 2. has availed him&s;elf of this mi&s;take of Strabo, to &s;upport his &s;trange dream, that the Hibernia of Strabo was Scotland, and that Ireland was unknown to the ancients till the time of Ve&s;pa|&s;ian! Such utter blindne&s;s can &s;elf-love throw over the mind! Ireland, a great and fertile iland, was known to the ancients as early as Britain, and gave ri&s;e to the plural Ca&s;&s;iterides of Herodotus, 'Briti&s;h ilands' of Polybius. As lying on the we&s;t of Britain, it &s;eems to have been known to the Phoeni|cians, even before Britain. Scotland, the mo&s;t remote cor|ner of Britain, mu&s;t have been la&s;t known, as common &s;en&s;e argues. But it is ri&s;ible to &s;ee Ireland totally, vani&s;h in the weak prejudice of this bigot. He, who could take the Mona of Cae&s;ar for Emona, an ile of an acre of ground in the frith of Forth, cannot de&s;erve confutation. All foreign writers put Strabo's idea, of Ireland being on the north of Britain, as a mere mi&s;take, as well as his extending the we&s;tern point of Britain &s;o as to front the Pyrenees. Such mi&s;takes appear in the be&s;t ancient writers, but are to be corrected by better information. Mr. Goodal betrays his &s;illy intention at the beginning of this very chapter, by telling that, as &s;ome will have Ireland to be the mo&s;t ancient Scotia, &s;o he will &s;hew that Scotland was the mo&s;t ancient Hibernia! A pretty re|venge!</NOTE>. Strabo, if we may judge from his behaviour to Herodotus, &s;eems to have been very fond of his own ideas, and to have looked upon all information as fabulous, that cla&s;hed with his preconceptions. If he heard of Cae&s;ar's account, who rightly put Ireland on the we&s;t of Britain, he has only looked on it as akin to that of Herodotus, who regarded the Ca&s;pian as a lake. Yet both Cae&s;ar and Herodotus were right; and Strabo egregiou&s;ly wrong: a le&s;&s;on of mode&s;ty to tho&s;e who prefer what they call philo&s;ophy to in|formation. For his incon&s;i&s;tent mea&s;urements, blame is no doubt due to tran&s;cribers; for numbers are in all MSS. mo&s;t apt to be blundered. But his own errors in placing Ireland north of Britain, and extending the &s;outh of Britain from the Pyrenees to
<PB N="8" REF="93">the Rhine, with others equally gro&s;s, only &s;trike us with the imperfection of ancient geography, and of Strabo's information on &s;ome matters in particu|lar. But if we reflect our&s;elves, that &s;imilar errors with regard to America, and other di&s;tant coun|tries, may be found in geographers of the la&s;t century, we mu&s;t al&s;o reflect that the we&s;t of Europe was an America to the Greeks; and be content to correct their mi&s;takes, by the &s;olid information of Tacitus, and other Romans, who&s;e knowlege was immediate and authentic. The grand cau&s;e of Strabo's error, with regard to Ireland, &s;eems to have been, that it was the furthe&s;t land di&s;covered to the northward, and he of cour&s;e thought it the furthe&s;t north from A&s;ia and Greece. Strabo &s;ays nothing of the north of Britain, and &s;eems not to have &s;een Diodorus, for he only names <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, as one of the three terminating promontories; but the names of the other two, Belerion, and Orcas, he does not mention.</P>
<P>Claudius, who began to reign 41 years after our aera, is rightly marked by Tacitus<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Agricola.</NOTE> as the fir&s;t emperor who began the real conque&s;t of Britain, then more and more known; for Mela, who wrote, as his work expre&s;&s;es<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">III. 6.</NOTE>, at the commencement of this conque&s;t, mentions the Orcades, or Orkneys, and &s;ays they amount to thirty in number: a calcula|tion pretty accurate, for they are twenty &s;ix. Me|la's mention of the Orkneys &s;eems to have given ri&s;e to a fable, retailed by Eutropius and Beda, and other writers of the declining ages, that Claudius conquered the Orkneys. Ve&s;pa&s;ian was the general employed by Claudius in Britain, and was here, as Tacitus phra&s;es it, '&s;hewn to the fates.'</P>
<P>Under Nero, Suetonius Paullinus continued the conque&s;t of Britain; and Tacitus, in the life of Agri|cola, has given us an idea of his progre&s;s. Pliny, the natural hi&s;torian, wrote under Ve&s;pa&s;ian, or
<PB N="9" REF="94">about 70 years after Chri&s;t; but even now nothing concerning North Britain can be found<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Pliny IV. 16. &s;ays that Pytheas and I&s;idorus put the cir|cumference of Albion at about 3800 miles: that Agrippa marked it's length at 800, breadth 300, and Ireland as of the &s;ame breadth, but 200 miles le&s;s in length. Pliny mentions Orcades, Acmodae (perhaps Shetland iles) Haebudes, Mona, Monapia, Ricnea.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Yet was it in the reign of Ve&s;pa&s;ian that full &s;plendor was to be diffu&s;ed over Scotland, from the arms of Agricola, &s;o nobly celebrated by Tacitus. Agricola &s;eems to have taken the command in Bri|tain in the con&s;ul&s;hip of Ceionius Commodus, and Cornelius Pri&s;cus, 78 years after Chri&s;t, being the la&s;t year of the reign of Ve&s;pa&s;ian, and to have left it in the fourth year of Domitian, or the 84th year of our aera<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Hor&s;ley's Brit. Rom.</NOTE>. The Brigantes, or people of York&s;hire, &amp;c. had been &s;ubdued by Cerealis<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Pliny IV. 16. mentions the Silva Caledonia, as the boundary of the Roman knowlege of Britain.</NOTE>, and all South Britain was &s;ubject to Rome; &s;o that the conque&s;t of Agricola began at the Tweed; and to him we owe all we know concerning the &s;tate of Scotland, when fir&s;t explored by the Romans. The Engli&s;h have Cae&s;ar for the father of their hi&s;tory: the Scoti&s;h have Tacitus.</P>
<P>Tacitus wrote his life of Agricola in the year of Chri&s;t 97, as Brotier &s;hews, being the year of Rome 849, and fir&s;t of Trajan. He tells us, that Fabius Ru&s;ticus compared the &s;hape of Britain to a bipennis, or polax, that is, it's triangular head: but that the extent of Caledonia, or Scotland, run|ning far on, gives it rather the &s;hape of a <HI>cuneus,</HI> or wedge: an ob&s;ervation ju&s;t to this day. He then mentions that the Roman fleets had &s;ailed around it, and had di&s;covered the Orkneys, and &s;een Thule<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">The veracity of Pytheas has found able &s;upports in D'An|ville, Ge&s;ner, Murray, (Mem. des Infer. Acta Goeting. &amp;c.). D'Anville will have the real ancient Thule to be Shetland; but, i confe&s;s, i cannot conceive, that from the northern extremity of Britain, to Shetland, &s;hould be a navigation of <HI>&s;ix</HI> days. Iceland &s;eems to an&s;wer the de&s;cription better.</NOTE>. Tacitus, however, adds little to the
<PB N="10" REF="95">geography of Scotland, &s;ave the weight of his great name; for he only mentions <HI>Taus,</HI> or the Tay; <HI>Glota,</HI> or Clyde; <HI>Bodotria,</HI> or Forth; the <HI>Mons Grampius,</HI> or Grampian hills; and the <HI>Ho|re&s;ti,</HI> thought to be the people of Fife&s;hire.</P>
<P>About forty years after Tacitus wrote, Ptolemy gave his geography; which many concur to re|gard as the mo&s;t inaccurate work of antiquity, and which others, with more rea&s;on, think a wonderful production for the time. Indeed to expect accuracy in ancient geography will ap|pear ridiculous to any one, who reflects in the lea&s;t on the deficiency of ancient &s;cience. We al|low for errors in ancient natural hi&s;tory, &amp;c. why not equal allowance in geography? How could the ancients take longitudes, or latitudes, with any exactne&s;s? Ptolemy's geography of Scotland is, above all, &s;ingularly defective, for he makes the whole country bend due <HI>ea&s;t,</HI> from the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, or Mull of Galloway, to the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, or Promontory Orcas of Caithne&s;s. So that all Scot|land, in&s;tead of running due north, runs due ea&s;t: nor can this ari&s;e from any corruption of his text, but was infallibly his opinion, from the longitudes and latitudes he lays down at full length, for a hundred places. The whole of Ptolemy's work that regards Scotland may be found in the Appen|dix: and particular illu&s;trations of it, in two chapters, Parts II. and III. of this treati&s;e.</P>
<P>The other geographical notices concerning Scotland, to be found in Greek or Roman writers, are too minute to de&s;erve enumeration, and will be found, as they ri&s;e to hi&s;torical view, in the cour&s;e of this work. The <HI>Notitia Imperii,</HI> written about 406, in the reigns of Arcadius, and Hono|rius,
<PB N="11" REF="96">was found in Britain, as Alciatus tells in his preface; and has a li&s;t of the &s;tations along the Wall of Antoninus, between Clyde and Forth, as afterward &s;hall be &s;hewn, not that of Hadrian be|tween Solway and Tine, as imagined by anti|quaries. The <HI>Itinerarium Antonini</HI> has al&s;o one or two names of Roman &s;tations in Scotland; and is a work of nearly the &s;ame period with the Notitia. The vulgar title is utterly ab&s;urd, as Vo&s;&s;ius &s;hews, for it can belong to no Antoninus, as it mentions <HI>Con&s;tantinopolis, Maximianopolis,</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tantina,</HI> &s;o mu&s;t be po&s;terior to Con&s;tantine I. It &s;eems to be the work of Julius Honorius, mentioned by Ca&s;&s;iodorus, and others; but &s;ee the remarks of Gronovius, in his edition of Mela, <HI>Lug. Bat.</HI> 1696, 8<HI>vo.</HI> Some MSS. bear <HI>Incipit Chronica Julii Cae&s;aris,</HI> a title as ju&s;t as that of <HI>Itinerarium Antonini:</HI> but <HI>Itinerarium Imperiale</HI> would be the be&s;t title. The <HI>Tabula Peutingeriana</HI> has nothing concerning Britain, except a &s;mall fragment of the &s;outh of England. The <HI>Geographus Anonymus Ravennas</HI> enumerates a few names of places in Scotland: he wrote in the &s;eventh, or eighth, cen|tury; and that pa&s;&s;age, tho of no value, is given in the Appendix.</P>
<P>Such are all the ancient monuments, which illu&s;|trate the Roman geography of Scotland. But a modern one, of a mo&s;t &s;ingular kind, al&s;o de&s;erves mention, namely, the work of <HI>Ricardus Corinen&s;is,</HI> or Richard of Cirence&s;ter, a writer of the Four|teenth century. Mr. Bertram, an Engli&s;hman re&s;iding in Denmark, found this work there, about thirty years ago, in a MS. which, from a &s;peci|men &s;ent, Mr. Ca&s;ley, a good judge, pronounced 400 years old; and it was publi&s;hed at Copenhagen in 1758. The author had it &s;eems travelled to Italy<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Stukeley's Account of Richard of Cirence&s;ter, 1757, 4to.</NOTE>; and had there peru&s;ed Cae&s;ar, Strabo, Ptolemy, Tacitus, and other authentic writers.

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER II</HI> The earlie&s;t Celtic inhabitants of Scotland.</HEAD>
<P>THE Greek and Roman writers mu&s;t now be left for a while, that a point may be inve&s;ti|gated, on which they afford no light. But let not the reader imagine that he is to be led into the regions of &s;y&s;tematic conjecture, or etymolo|gical madne&s;s. A rigid enquiry after truth is the &s;ole aim of this performance. Truth has bounds. Error has none. The cultivated land of &s;cience is not exten&s;ive: but around it ly the &s;andy hills and de&s;erts of fal&s;ehood, ready to be rai&s;ed in whirlwinds by every bla&s;t of prejudice or folly, and to &s;wallow up parts at once, which it requires infinite labour to clear.</P>
<P>It is well known that the Celts were the ancient inhabitants of Europe. They were reduced to a third part of Gaul, and to the we&s;tern part of Bri|tain and Ireland, before the time of Cae&s;ar. But, before they were expelled by the Scythians of A&s;ia, they appear to have held mo&s;t of Europe. Pliny mentions a <HI>Promontorium Celticae,</HI> which, by the &s;ituation he gives, and the names around, mu&s;t have been near Mo&s;cow in Ru&s;&s;ia. The Cimmerii, who were driven from the Euxine, by the Scythians, were, as the ancients inform, the &s;ame with the Cimbri; and the Cimbri were Celts, as fully &s;hewn in the annexed Di&s;&s;ertation. The Celts being expelled by the Scythians; and re|duced to the we&s;tern extremities of Europe, about 500 years before Chri&s;t, little knowlege of them can be derived from the Grecian earlie&s;t
<PB N="14" REF="99">writers, who only mention them as a people living far to the we&s;t. But they have left, in the names of rivers and hills, &s;ure marks of their language and re&s;idence<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See the&s;e points fully illu&s;trated, and the authorities, in the Di&s;&s;ertation at the end of this work.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>When a man is writing upon a point of anti|quity, without direct authorities, he &s;hould &s;ay very little, and very much to the purpo&s;e. That the reader may therefore &s;ee at once, that there is a firm foundation for inferring a Celtic race of men to have been the earlie&s;t inhabitants we can trace of Scotland, in particular, he mu&s;t attend to a fact, which is equipollent to the be&s;t authorities. This fact is that the names of rivers, and moun|tains, all over Scotland, even to the furthe&s;t we&s;tern iles, are very often, in that dialect of the Celtic, called the Welch, or Cumraig<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">See the different de&s;criptions of Scotland; and tho&s;e of the Hebudes, by Martin, Dr. Macpher&s;on, Macauley, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To give this fact full weight, it mu&s;t be re|marked that the Piks, whom Beda<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Lib. I. c. 1.</NOTE> mentions as the fir&s;t inhabitants of North Britain, and whom Agricola found there, were, as Beda &s;ays, a peo|ple of Scythia, a name Jornandes and others give to Scandinavia; and according to Tacitus<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Agricola. The origin of the Piks is fully illu&s;trated, Part III.</NOTE> were Germans. That is, by both accounts they were Scythians or Goths<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">See Di&s;&s;ertation annexed.</NOTE>, &s;o that the Celtic names could not be their's. Next it mu&s;t be remarked that the Dalriads, or pre&s;ent highlanders, a pal|try Iri&s;h colony, never extended beyond Argyle till a late period<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">As &s;hewn, Part IV.</NOTE>. Nor could the names be their's, &s;ince the Welch differs widely from the Iri&s;h; and the more old they are, the difference is the greater, &s;o that Beda marks them as two different tongues, as much as the Engli&s;h and Latin<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Beda, lib. I. c. 1. quinque gentium linguis...An|glorum, videlicet, Britonum, Scottorum, Pictorum, et Lati|norum.</NOTE>. The&s;e names
<PB N="15" REF="100" MS="Y">therefore neither belong to the Piks, nor Dal|riads. Of cour&s;e they belong to inhabitants pre|ceding both.</P>
<P>As the Iri&s;h call their tongue Gaelic, or Gau|li&s;h; &s;o the Wel&s;h call theirs Cumraig. As the Iri&s;h call them&s;elves Gael or Gauls, &s;o the Wel&s;h call them&s;elves Cumri. Now it appears that the Celts (a grand generic name, as the Sarmatians, Goths, Mongols, &amp;c.) con&s;i&s;ted originally of two va&s;t divi&s;ions, namely the Gael or Gauls, who were the ancient inhabitants of all Gaul; and the Cumri, or Cimbri, or Cimmerii, who held all Germany<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Di&s;&s;ertation.</NOTE>. As to the etymology of Celt, Gael, Cumri, they &s;hall be left to tho&s;e <HI>qui omnia &s;ciunt et plus,</HI> who know every thing and more.</P>
<P>As the &s;outh part of Britain was fir&s;t peopled from Gaul, by Gael, who were afterward expelled by Cumri, from Germany<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Part II. c. 1.</NOTE>; &s;o there is rea&s;on to infer that the north part of Britain was fir&s;t peo|pled by Cumri, from pre&s;ent Jutland. For the pa&s;&s;age from the Cimbric Cher&s;one&s;e to North Britain, thro open &s;ea, was far more ea&s;y than from the &s;outh of Britain to the north, thro va&s;t fore&s;ts. Sea, far from hindering, promotes even &s;avage colonization; and late navigators have found ilands in the Pacific Ocean, 500 or 600 miles from each other, all peopled by one race of men. Where men and &s;ea are found, canoes are always found, even in the earlie&s;t &s;tate of &s;ociety: and the &s;avage Fins, and Greenlanders, perform far longer navigations, than from Jutland to Scot|land. The length of Britain is &s;o great, from &s;outh to north, that to populate the later from the former, mu&s;t have been a work of ages; whereas the pa&s;&s;age from Germany was open and ea&s;y. The Piks, as fully &s;hewn afterward, came
<PB N="16" REF="101">from Norway to Scotland; and analogy may infer that the fir&s;t Celtic inhabitants of the later country proceeded from the north of Germany. The Cim|bri, or Cumri, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the coa&s;t of Germany, oppo|&s;ite to North Britain, or the Cimbric Cher&s;one&s;e, even down to a late period. As it is improbable that the north of Britain remained without Celtic inhabitants, while all the oppo&s;ite country of Ger|many was held by them, it is rea&s;onable to infer, that the Cimbri were the fir&s;t inhabitants. But when we find Cimbric names of mountains, and rivers, remaining in the mo&s;t remote parts of Scot|land, the inference acquires as much certainty as the ca&s;e will permit. The&s;e Cimbri, the fir&s;t inha|bitants of Scotland that can be traced, were of one great &s;tock with the Cumri, or Welch; but the Welch are not their de&s;cendents, but remains of the Cimbri of South Britain, who pa&s;&s;ed from the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t of Germany, and drove the Gael or Gauls, the fir&s;t inhabitants, into Ireland, as &s;hall pre&s;ently be evinced.</P>
<P>The Cimbri held Scotland till the Piks carne and expelled them; an event which; as &s;hall af|terward be &s;hewn, happened about 200 years be|fore Chri&s;t. The&s;e Cimbri were driven by the Piks, down below Loch Fyn, and the Tay, and after beyond the friths of Forth and Clyde, where a part remained till a late period<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Part II.</NOTE>, and they are doubtle&s;s the pregenitors of &s;ome of the inhabitants of Clyd&s;dale, and Galloway.</P>
<P>But the greate&s;t part appears to have pa&s;t into Ireland, from the oppo&s;ite &s;hores; and, if the <HI>Tu|ath de Danan</HI> of Iri&s;h fables had any exi&s;tence, it is likely they were Cumri from North Britain. For by the Iri&s;h accounts<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">O'Flaherty, O'Conor, &amp;c.</NOTE> the Tuath de Danan came from North Britain; and from Ptolemy it appears, that a tribe of the Cumri, in Air&s;hire, Renfrew, &amp;c. was called Damnii; as was al&s;o a
<PB N="17" REF="102">tribe on the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t of Ireland, according to Richard. But Ptolemy palls the Iri&s;h tribe, <HI>Da|rini;</HI> and the Tuath de Danan may be a fairy people. However this be, there is rea&s;on to think that a great part of the Cumri pa&s;&s;ed from North Britain into Ireland.</P>
<P>The Celtic nations had been driven to the we&s;t of Gaul, Britain, and Ireland, by the Scythians, or Goths, at lea&s;t 300 years before Chri&s;t, as &s;hewn in the Di&s;&s;ertation annexed: and their re|mains were &s;o intermingled with their conquerors, that their language and manners were half Gothic, even before the Chri&s;tian aera, and have been al|ways getting more and more &s;o. Hence no ac|count of real Celtic manners, or language, can be recovered. But from every argument of ancient authority, and of their manners recorded by &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive authors of the middle ages, and exi&s;ting even to this day, the ancient Celts mu&s;t have been mere &s;avages. A&s;ia was the parent of arms, arts, and cultivation; and when the Scythians poured into Europe from the &s;hores of the Euxine, the Celts were to them, as the &s;avages of America to the European &s;ettlers. The Fins and Celts were the &s;ole indigenes of Europe; and the man|ners of the Laplanders can alone afford any ana|logy whereby to judge of tho&s;e of the real Celts. This century has been overwhelmed with non&s;en&s;e concerning Druidi&s;m, and Druidic monuments, as being univer&s;al among the Celts. Druidi&s;m, as we know from Cae&s;ar<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Lib. VI.</NOTE>, was a late invention in the &s;outh of Britain: and it was totally aboli&s;hed by Tiberius<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Plin. Hi&s;t. Nat. xxx. I.</NOTE>. It was palpably Phoenician<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Di&s;&s;ertation annexed, p. 68.</NOTE>, and was taught by the Phoenicians to the inhabitants of Cornwall, where they traded for tin: nor is there a &s;ingle authority, in all antiquity, for its ever ex|tending, during the century or &s;o that it exi&s;ted,
<PB N="18" REF="103">beyond the iland Mona, or Angle&s;ey, and the Garonne, or &s;outhern bound of Celtica, in Gaul. They therefore who &s;peak of Druidi&s;m in Germany, Caledonia, or Ireland, are mere vi&s;ionaries. Ta|citus knew of no Druids, either in Germany, or Caledonia<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Germania et Agricola. Cae&s;ar VI. &s;ays expre&s;sly, the Germans had no Druids, <HI>neque Druides habent.</HI> Tacitus, in Agricola, &s;ays the Caledonians were Germans.</NOTE>; and there is not a &s;hadow of autho|rity for Druids in Ireland. Druidic monuments form another idle dream of antiqui&s;ts; but the Celts had no monuments, any more than the Fins, or &s;avage Africans, or Americans; and tho&s;e mo|numents are really Gothic, and are common in Scandinavia and Iceland, where no Celts, or Druids were known. Tho&s;e ignorantly called Druidic Temples, are Gothic Courts of Ju&s;tice, u&s;ed for that purpo&s;e in Scandinavia and Iceland, down to a late period<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">See Wormius, Bartholin, and other Northern Antiquaries.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER I.</HI> Origins of the Southern Britons.</HEAD>
<P>THE Southern part of Britain, now called England, was no doubt originally peopled from Gaul, at a time when the Celts, or primitive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of Gaul, held all that country, even up to the Rhine. The&s;e <HI>Gael,</HI> or fir&s;t inhabitants of Britain, were driven into Ireland by another Celtic colony of the Cimbri, or <HI>Cumri,</HI> from Germany, remains of which exi&s;t in the pre&s;ent Cumri, or Wel&s;h. The la&s;t, in their turn, were confined to the we&s;t and north parts of pre&s;ent England by the <HI>Belgae,</HI> a third colony, who arrived from Bel|gic Gaul, and who, as de&s;cended of the Germans,
<PB N="22" REF="106" MS="Y">did not &s;peak the Celtic, but the Gothic tongued. When Cae&s;ar landed here, he tells us, he found Britain inhabited by two races of men, the <HI>Belgae</HI> in the countries on the &s;outh-ea&s;t; and tho&s;e he calls <HI>Indigenes,</HI> in the inner parts. The la&s;t were palpably the Welch, after called <HI>Britones,</HI> as the mo&s;t an|tient inhabitants: for all memory of the Gael, or real Indigenes, was unknown to the Roman and Saxon writers.</P>
<P>The bright page of Cae&s;ar affords &s;ufficient notice of the Second and Third of the&s;e Colonies; but a reader of accuracy will a&s;k what fact or authority is there for the Fir&s;t. Such a reader it is my &s;ole ambition to plea&s;e; and i &s;hall therefore give him the facts which have convinced me, tho little cre|dulous in points of this nature. Every reader will allow that the Roman, and much more the Saxon writers were too late, and too unacquainted with the Cumraig language and traditions to attain knowlege of an event which mu&s;t have happened near a thou&s;and years before the time of Cae&s;ar. This event mu&s;t therefore be &s;ought among the Cimbri them&s;elves, who expelled the&s;e Gael; and it was &s;o va&s;t, and mu&s;t have left &s;uch traces behind, that we may &s;afely tru&s;t them with it. Now Lloyd, a man perfectly ver&s;ed in the Welch language and antiquities, is our chief guide to this fact. For in his Archaeologia<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Preface.</NOTE>, he tells us much of the <HI>Guydhe|lians,</HI> as he calls them, being but a Welch pro|nunciation of <HI>Gael,</HI> or <HI>Gadhel,</HI> the Gauls; and &s;ays they inhabited all England and Wales before the Welch came into the iland and expelled them: and he adds, that the&s;e Guydhelians, or real Abo|rigines, doubtle&s;s came from Gaul to this iland. This fact Mr. Lloyd &s;eems to put beyond a doubt, by remarking that in Wales it&s;elf many names of rivers and mountains are Gaelic, not Cumraig and mu&s;t have been impo&s;ed by more ancient in|habitants
<PB N="23" REF="107">than the Cumri or Wel&s;h. Mr. Mac|pher&s;on<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Introduction to the Hi&s;tory of Britain and Ireland.</NOTE> al&s;o has well remarked the three colonies above &s;tated, of Gael, Cimbri, and Belgae, tho he mi&s;takes the Belgae for Celts.</P>
<P>The Roman writers derived almo&s;t their whole ideas of Britain from the Belgae, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the &s;outh parts. As it was natural to think that Britain had fir&s;t been peopled from Gaul, and the Belgea knew of no colony preceding the Cimbri, whom they found in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, it is no wonder that the&s;e Cimbri pa&s;&s;ed with the Romans, who paid as little attention to the two races inhabiting Britain, as we do to two Indian nations, for the real Indigenes, or fir&s;t Gaulic colony. Cae&s;ar and Tacitus may be regarded as the only ancient writers who could po&s;&s;ibly illu&s;trate this que&s;tion: the former being in Britain him&s;elf; the later, if he did not attend Agri|cola, lived long in Belgic Gaul as Procurator, and had great opportunities of intelligence. Yet has Bri|tain been mo&s;t unfortunate in Roman accounts, for Cae&s;ar left the iland before much di&s;covery; and Tacitus is &s;o brief and ab&s;tract, that he of all writers affords lea&s;t materials for &s;uch enquiry. He is the eagle of hi&s;tory; and keeps &s;uch a &s;ublime tract, that particulars often e&s;cape his notice.</P>
<P>Yet let us con&s;ider a moment the accounts of Cae&s;ar and Tacitus. The former begins his de|&s;cription thus: "The inner part of Britain is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e who are reported to have been produced in the iland it&s;elf; the maritime part by tho&s;e who have pa&s;&s;ed from Belgic Gaul, for the &s;ake of war and prey<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Britanniae pars interior ab iis incolitur, quos natos in in|&s;ula ip&s;a memoria proditum dicunt: maritima parsab iis qui praedae ac belli inferendi cau&s;a, ex Belgio tran&s;ierunt, &amp;c. lib. V. Britain was unmole&s;ted by the Romans after this till the time of Claudius; or for near a century, during which the Belgae were always gaining ground. Cae&s;ar, as Tacitus ob&s;erves, only &s;aw Britain; and it is doubtful, if Tacitus &s;aw it: yet they are the only writers in the lea&s;t capable of giving us authentic information.</NOTE>." The re&s;t of his de&s;cription,
<PB N="24" REF="108">and actions in Britain, refer &s;olely to the Belgae. Of the Cimbri he knew nothing but, as above ex|pre&s;&s;ed, that there were reputed Indigenes in the inner part of the iland. He &s;ays nothing of Druids in his Briti&s;h tran&s;actions, nor of any thing that can apply to a Celtic people. Yet, in the next book, de&s;cribing the manners of the Gauls, and after tho&s;e of the Germans, he &s;ays, that <HI>in omni Gallia,</HI> 'in all Gaul,' there were two races of men, the people who were held as mere &s;laves, and another cla&s;s comprizing the Equites, or Knights, and Druids: and that the Druidic di&s;cipline was thought to have been invented in Britain, and brought from thence to Gaul; and that tho&s;e, who wi&s;hed to &s;tudy it much, went to Britain for that purpo&s;e. Now in the very beginning of his work, he tells us <HI>Gallia omnis,</HI> 'all Gaul', was divided into three parts, one inhabited by the Belgae, one by the Aquitani, one by the Celtae, <HI>qui ip&s;orum lingua Celtae no&s;tra Galli appellantur,</HI> al&s;o then called Gauls in &s;pecial by the Romans, as being the Original people of Gaul. <HI>Hi omnes lingua, in&s;titutis, legibus, inter &s;e differunt:</HI> 'all the&s;e differ in &s;peech, cu&s;toms, and laws.' Yet in de&s;cribing the cu&s;toms of Gaul, he puts all as the &s;ame. Has he not herein palpably contra|dicted him&s;elf? Or is the fact this, that his <HI>omnis Gallia</HI> of the Sixth book is quite different from his <HI>omnis Gallia</HI> of the fir&s;t; the former applying &s;olely to the Celtae, who were peculiarly called Galli, in his time, as Cae&s;ar &s;ays? He tells us, lib. ii. c. 4. <HI>Belgas e&s;&s;e ortos a Germanis,</HI> 'that the Belgae &s;prung from the Germans,' or, in other words, they were Germans. The <HI>omnis Gallia</HI> of the Sixth book, is Gallia proper, Celtic Gaul, where alone Druids could exi&s;t; for he mentions, in de&s;cribing the Germans in the next page, that they had no Druids, <HI>neque Druides habent.</HI> The Belgae had of cour&s;e no Druids, neither in Gaul, nor Britain. The Celts, or Galli proper, had; and it was from the Celts of the we&s;t of Britain, that this di&s;cipline,
<PB N="25" REF="109">according to Cae&s;ar, came. Cea&s;ar u&s;es <HI>Gallus, Gallica,</HI> quite laxly, and indi&s;criminately, as we u&s;e <HI>Indian.</HI> In mentioning the people of Kent, he &s;ays, <HI>neque multum a Gallica differunt con&s;uetudine,</HI> 'in cu&s;toms they differ little from the Gallic:' yet they were Belgae, and of cour&s;e he means the cu&s;toms of Belgic Gaul. The word <HI>Gallus</HI> applies among the Romans to Belgium, Aquitania, Celtica, Gallia Braccata, Ci&s;alpine Gaul, all together, or either of them: the word <HI>Britannus</HI> applies with the ancients to Cimbri, Belgae, Caledones or Piks. It is from circum&s;tances we mu&s;t determine di&s;tinctly what di&s;tance, that renders all objects in|di&s;tinct, made indi&s;criminate to them. We in Europe &s;peak of Indians in the Ea&s;t, and in Ame|rica: tho&s;e who re&s;ide in Ea&s;t India, or in America, &s;peak of many di&s;tinct nations in the&s;e countries, totally different in origin, &s;peech, and manners. Great confu&s;ion has ari&s;en from not attending to this. For in&s;tance, we know that tho&s;e Gauls, who took Rome, ravaged Greece, and &s;ettled in A&s;ia, under the title of Galatae, were of Ci&s;alpine Gaul: and that the inhabitants of Ci&s;alpine Gaul, and of Gallia Braccata, and of Belgium, the only Gauls who figure in hi&s;tory, were all Germans, and not one Celt among them. Yet are they called Celts; tho the Senones, who took Rome, were the very Semnones of the &s;outh of Germany; tho the Celts wore no braccae, or breeches, the grand badge of Germans; tho we know from Cae&s;ar, and Strabo<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Strabo &s;hews the Belgic manners to have been quite Ger|man; and &s;ays ri&s;ibly, that the Germans were &s;o called by the Romans, as being <HI>Germani,</HI> or brothers German of the Belgic Gauls. Lib. IV.</NOTE>, that the Belgae were Germans: tho, in &s;hort, the Celtae were confined to the mo&s;t remote part of Gaul, and could not defend them&s;elves again&s;t the Germans, and Iberi, far le&s;s make any conque&s;ts abroad.</P>
<PB N="26" REF="110" MS="Y">
<P>Tacitus next merits con&s;ideration. He de&s;cribes Britain in his Agricola; and, like Cae&s;ar, confounds all the Gauls, &s;o that we do not know whether he means Belgae, or Celtae. He mentions three races of men in Britain, the Germans in Caledonia; the Silures, who were Celts, of Wales and Corn|wall<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Tacitus, mi&s;led by the old opinion of Cae&s;ar, and others, that Spain lay on the <HI>we&s;t</HI> of Britain and Ireland, hints an idea that the Silures came from Spain, but in&s;tantly retracts it, and infers them of Celtic Gaul, tho indeed Cumraig Celts. The <HI>torti crines et colorati vultus,</HI> 'curled hair, and brown faces,' which al&s;o led him to think the Silures Spaniards, be|long to the Celts of Wales, Ireland, Scotland, at this day; who have black curled hair, and brown faces; tho&s;e few among them who have fair faces, and red, or light hair, the grand features of the Goths, are of Gothic extract.</NOTE>; the Galli oppo&s;ite to Gaul. It is remarka|ble that he al&s;o mentions no Druids in Britain, &s;ave in the Fourteenth book of his Annals, when de|&s;cribing the attack of Suetonius Paullinus upon Mona, or Angle&s;ey. <HI>Proximi Gallis et &s;imiles &s;unt,</HI> 'the Britons next Gaul, re&s;emble the Gauls,' is all we can get from Tacitus, to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e. In his Germania he u&s;es <HI>Gallica lingua,</HI> palpably for the Gaelic, or Celtic; and he finds the E&s;tii, a people of pre&s;ent Pru&s;&s;ia, to have a &s;peech re|&s;embling the <HI>Briti&s;h.</HI> They were in all appearance remains of the old Cimbri, and &s;poke the Cumraig; for, had he meant the Belgic Briti&s;h, it was actual German, &s;o could not be di&s;tingui&s;hed in Germany. This is the only faint hint we have, that Tacitus knew there was a peculiar Briti&s;h tongue, neither &s;poken in Germany nor Gaul; and which was pal|pably that of Cae&s;ar's Indigenes, the Cimbri. Ta|citus &s;eems to have known nothing of Britain &s;ave the coa&s;ts. Had Suetonius Paullinus written his own campaigns, and been a man of ob&s;ervation like Cae&s;ar, we &s;hould have known the re&s;t upon Roman authority, as well as we know the &s;outh in|habited by the Belgae, from Cae&s;ar, and the north inhabited by their German Brethren, from Tacitus.
<PB N="27" REF="111">Of the middle, Cae&s;ar &s;eems to have known more than Tacitus. Indeed, the Romans de&s;pi&s;ed Bri|tain, and afford us poor materials concerning it. Strabo, lib. II. p. 115. echoes their contempt, &s;ay|ing, that it is an ile of no u&s;e, and its people not to be feared. No wonder then that their accounts are quite brief, and inaccurate. All it's people were alike &s;avages to them: their various tongues and manners they did not care to know.</P>
<P>To this is owing a great deficience in the accounts of Roman Britain, namely, that we cannot fix the bounds between the Belgae and the Cimbri, the Gothic part of the inhabitants and the Celtic. Mr. Whitaker, who mi&s;takes, the Belgae al&s;o for Celts, attempts to mark their territories<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;tory of Manche&s;ter, and Genuine Hi&s;tory of the Britons.</NOTE>, but with his u&s;ual fancy, and ingenious aberration from good &s;en&s;e. He con&s;tantly refers to his authori|ties; but, upon con&s;ulting them, the reader will find that an overheated imagination <HI>bends its eye on vacancy,</HI> and &s;ees every thing where cool judgment &s;ees nothing. From Cae&s;ar and Tacitus no po&s;i|tive help can be derived on this &s;ubject. The whole &s;outh of England was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Belgae, &s;ave Devon&s;hire and Cornwall, in which, and the &s;outh half of Wales, dwelled the SILURES, a numerous people in two nations, the <HI>Dumnonii</HI> &s;outh mo&s;t, and the <HI>Demetae</HI> in &s;outh Wales<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">In Richard's book, always to be cautiou&s;ly u&s;ed, we find Cimbri among the Silures; but from his own words, <HI>utrumne vero modernum Walliae nomen dederint,</HI> &amp;c. it is clear that he has confounded a Generic name with that of a tribe, owing pro|bably to the confu&s;ed manner of old maps.</NOTE>. That the Dumnonii were Silures, appears clear from this, that Tacitus &s;ays the Silures live oppo&s;ite to Spain, and the Dumnonii were in fact the only people op|po&s;ite to Spain. The chief of the Scilly iles is al&s;o called Silura by Solinus, and the pre&s;ent name &s;eems to &s;pring from it. Be&s;ide, the Silures are men|tioned as a va&s;t people, like the Belgae and Cimbri,
<PB N="28" REF="112">and mu&s;t of cour&s;e have had various tribes; for, if only one tribe in South Wales, as &s;uppo&s;ed, Tacitus would not have mentioned them as a di&s;tinct race, for they would have been too minute for notice.</P>
<P>Toward the north, if i mi&s;take not, the Belgae extended to the Humber, as to the Severn on the we&s;t. Mr. Whitaker oppo&s;es this, and almo&s;t con|fines them to the &s;outh of the Thames; becau&s;e, &s;ays he, Cae&s;ar places them in the maritime parts. Strange that Mr. W. forgot that England has ma|ritime parts on the ea&s;t, as well as on the &s;outh; and that the ea&s;t parts were more oppo&s;ite to the Belgic coa&s;t of the continent, than the &s;outh! As all allow the country &s;outh of the Thames, and we&s;t to the mouth of the Severn and Devon&s;hire, to have been in the hands of the Belgae, i &s;hall not examine Mr. Whitaker's revelations as to their pro|gre&s;s in this quarter, &s;ave in one point as a &s;peci|men. Cae&s;ar &s;ays that the Belgic tribes in Britain retained generally the names of their original tribes in Gaul. Mr. W. who forgot that Cae&s;ar &s;peaks of Belgic, or German, Gaul, dreams that this refers to Celtic Gaul; and is &s;o ab&s;urd as to call the <HI>Bebroces</HI> and <HI>Atrebates</HI> aboriginal Britons or Gael, becau&s;e their names are found in Gaul! True; but it is in Belgic Gaul; where, if you look into any map prefixed to a &s;chool Cae&s;ar, you will find them. The <HI>Morini</HI> are al&s;o in Belgic Gaul. The <HI>Segon|tiaci,</HI> of Hamp&s;hire, &s;eem the <HI>Sueconi</HI> of Belgic Gaul, bordering on the Atrebates there as here: &s;ee Clu|verius. The <HI>Hedui,</HI> on the mouth of the Severn, alone remain di&s;puted. Mr. W. will have them aboriginal Gael, becau&s;e there were Aedui in Celtic Gaul. Richard of Cirence&s;ter, as publi&s;hed by Bertram, is <HI>&s;ole</HI> authority for the&s;e Hedui, and little to be tru&s;ted; yet, if i mi&s;take not, Mr. Bertram has redd <HI>Hedui</HI> for <HI>He&s;&s;ui.</HI> The Hedui were quite to the &s;outh of Gaul, and &s;urrounded on all hands with hundreds of warlike nations, whence it is improbable, if not impo&s;&s;ible, that
<PB N="29" REF="113" MS="Y">they could come to Britain. The E&s;&s;ui (&s;ee Cae&s;ar, lib. V. and the geographers) were in Belgic Gaul, between the Atrebates and Morini, exactly as the&s;e Hedui here. We may therefore mo&s;t &s;afely read He&s;&s;ui.</P>
<P>Let us now proceed to the north of the Thames. The <HI>Trinobantes</HI> of E&s;&s;ex, Mr. Whitaker, and all, grant to be Belgae, The di&s;puted nations therefore are only the <HI>Ca&s;&s;ii, Boduni, Cenomanni, Iceni,</HI> and <HI>Coritani,</HI> being all between the Thames and Hum|ber. The <HI>Ca&s;&s;ii</HI> were &s;urely part of the <HI>Vello Ca&s;&s;i</HI> of Belgic Gaul, who were the Ca&s;&s;i, with an epithet. Be&s;ides, the very name of Londinium, or London, the capital of the Ca&s;&s;ii and of the iland, &s;hews that they were a Gothic people: <HI>Lunden</HI> being the capi|tal of Anglen in Denmark, whence the Engli&s;h came: and another Lunden in Schonen is e&s;teemed the mo&s;t ancient city in the northern kingdoms. The name is thought to be from the Gothic <HI>Lund,</HI> a wood: <HI>Lund-dun,</HI> a fort, or town in a wood. The <HI>Cha&s;&s;i</HI> were al&s;o a German people, as Cluverius &s;hews. To the <HI>Boduni</HI> i can find no &s;imilar name in Gaul, &s;ave that of Boduog|natus, general of the Nervii, a Belgic tribe. The <HI>Budini,</HI> a Scythian people, in Herodotus, re&s;emble it: as does <HI>Boda,</HI> in Blanckenburg of Germany, <HI>Bodumna</HI> a penin&s;ula of Jutland, <HI>Bodon</HI> in Mae&s;ia; all Gothic names but little to the purpo&s;e; tho it mu&s;t be added, that no &s;imilar names occur in Celtic Gaul. The <HI>Cenomanni,</HI> however, occur in Celtic Gaul; but <HI>manni</HI> is a termination quite un|known to any other Celtic nation. At the &s;ame time, tho they were in Celtic Gaul, they may have been a Belgic tribe, who, upon &s;ome pique, went over to the enemy, and had lands a&s;&s;igned to them, as u&s;ual among barbarous nations. The Belgae had many &s;ettlements in Celtic Gaul, as the Veneti, for in&s;tance, even in its extremity, who were Belgae, as Strabo informs, lib. IV. Names in <HI>manni</HI> are all Gothic, as Alamanni, Marcotmanni, &amp;c. The

Their city is by Richard called <HI>Ratis-Corion,</HI> a Gothic name, as appears from Rati&s;bon, Ratzeburg, Rati&s;boda, &amp;c. &amp;c. in Germany,</P>
<P>Nay the <HI>Brigantes,</HI> on the north of the Humber, may well be &s;u&s;pected a German nation. <HI>Brigan|tium</HI> in Spain, with a town of the &s;ame name on the <HI>Lacus Brigantinus</HI> in Vindelicia, were Gothic, not Celtic; as is the common German term, <HI>brig,</HI> or <HI>berg,</HI> 'a town.' Strabo and Stephanus Byzantinus tell, that <HI>briga</HI> or <HI>bria</HI> &s;ignified a town in the Thracic, Getic, or Gothic language. (See Part IV. ch. 1.)</P>
<P>No ancient authority can be brought again&s;t the above theory. Cae&s;ar and Tacitus rather con|firm it. Cae&s;ar mentions that many nations be|yond the Thames joined with Ca&s;&s;ivellaunus, leader of the &s;outhern tribes, to oppo&s;e him. The Cim|bri would rather have wi&s;hed the de&s;truction of the Belgae, their wor&s;t enemies, who had &s;eized their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. I mu&s;t not leave the Belgae without hinting, that, as Pliny places a people called Bri|tanni<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Harduin &s;ays, that all MSS. bear <HI>Britanni.</HI> Their &s;itua|tion was about Abbeville in Picardy; and San&s;on has written a book upon them, followed by Carte. Both the&s;e writers ri&s;ibly u&s;e a pa&s;&s;age, which Strabo gives as a &s;pecimen of an|cient <HI>ignorance,</HI> as a piece of ancient <HI>information,</HI> namely, that Britain was thought a city of Gaul! See Strabo IV. Mr. Whitaker as oddly confounds the&s;e with the people of Bre|tagne, who are as di&s;tant as the we&s;t is from the ea&s;t. The pa&s;&s;age of Sulpicius Severus is interpolated, as noted in the edition of Vor&s;tius and Le Clerc. Sidonius Apol inaris, about 480, is the fir&s;t real authority for Britons in Bretagne, <HI>&s;uper Ligerim;</HI> and there is a curious epi&s;tle of his to Rio|thamus, their king.</NOTE> in Belgic Gaul, it is highly probable the&s;e
<PB N="31" REF="115">Britanni were of the fir&s;t Belgae who pa&s;&s;ed into this iland, and gave a general name to the whole, tho they them&s;elves afterward &s;plit into different na|tions. The fir&s;t name of Britain, was Albion, as it long continued to be called. The name Britain mu&s;t to all appearance be &s;ought for in the Belgic, the Gothic, tongue.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, the Cumri were apparently confined to the we&s;t of Britain, and that part be|tween the Walls. The &s;outh and ea&s;t were held by Belgae, and perhaps other Germans, long be|fore Cae&s;ar's time. Nay, even in the parts &s;till in|habited by Celts, the Germans had, no doubt, many &s;ettlements; as the European &s;ettlers in America have not only large tracts wholly peopled by them&s;elves, but al&s;o towns and forts among the &s;avages. Thus in Gaul the Veneti, in the we&s;tern extremity of Celtica, were Belgae, as Strabo in|forms: and in the extreme we&s;t of Britain, &s;tood Menapia, a town of the very &s;ame name with one among the Scythians, or Goths, beyond the Ca&s;|pian, as we learn from Ptolemy. The conque&s;t of Europe by the Goths, on the fall of the Roman empire, was the &s;econd, not the fir&s;t, as &s;hewn in the annexed Di&s;&s;ertation. At lea&s;t three centuries before Chri&s;t, the Scythians, or Goths, had &s;ub|dued, and peopled, Europe, even to it's furthe&s;t extremities, as there fully di&s;played. In Britain, the Cumraig, or Welch, was called <HI>lingua Britan|nica,</HI> as in Gaul, the Celtic was called <HI>Gallica,</HI> not as being the univer&s;al tongue, but as the old and peculiar &s;peech of the earlier inhabitants. By <HI>Ame|rican languages</HI> we imply not Spani&s;h or Engli&s;h, but tho&s;e of the ancient natives.</P>
<P>When the Piks and Iri&s;h broke in upon the North, the Cimbri, who held the&s;e parts, were the mo&s;t expo&s;ed. The Belgae had al&s;o been &s;o lo&s;t in the luxuries of Rome, that they &s;eem to have to|tally abandoned their character of the brave&s;t of the
<PB N="32" REF="116">Gauls, and could not exi&s;t without Roman protec|tion, being by long habit quite, di&s;u&s;ed to arms. The Jutes, Saxons, Angli, were really the Gothic brethren of the Belgae, but finding them &s;o de|fencele&s;s, u&s;urped the power. Admitting the Belgae only to the offices of <HI>coloni</HI> and <HI>villani,</HI> their natural enmity to the Cumri, or Celts, induced them to give them no quarter, till driven to the barren rocks of the we&s;t; after an extermination of near a third, and expul&s;ion to France, and Ireland, of near another. But the Belgae &s;eem to have amounted to at lea&s;t three millions; whereas the conquerors never appear to have exceeded 100,000. Hence the Belgic tongue mu&s;t in time have prevailed, as the <HI>Lingua Romana Ru&s;tica</HI> in France, Italy, and Spain: and the old language of England is not Anglo-Saxon, but Anglo-Belgic. The numerous coloni, and &s;laves of the Saxons, even down to the Norman inva&s;ion<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">See Dome&s;day book; Wilkins's Leges Saxonicae: Brady, Carte, and Hume, their abridger; Stuart on the Engli&s;h Con&s;titution, &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE>, &s;urpri&s;e our writers, who know the Welch were expelled, but forget that &s;uch a people as the Belgae exi&s;ted. No traces of Welch names, &amp;c. being found among the Saxons, the&s;e numerous Coloni mu&s;t all have been Belgae, who by intermarriages, &amp;c. gradually changed their fortunes; &s;o that, before the Norman times, the Saxons and Belgae had nearly coale&s;ced into one people: tho even then Doom&s;day book &s;hews, that the Coloni and Villani po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the far greater part of the lands in England. Mo&s;t of the Romans in Britain were &s;tationed at the walls; and they had al&s;o different colonial towns: but, as we know from Gildas, Beda, &amp;c. that they utterly abandoned the iland long before the Saxons came, it is no wonder that no traces of Romans &s;hould occur in the Saxon Laws, tho &s;o frequent in the other Gothic Codes. The Roman language &s;eems to have been very
<PB N="33" REF="117">little u&s;ed by either Belgians, or Welch. The Old Saxon, and the Welch, have not many Latin words. Tacitus, <HI>in Agricola,</HI> tells us indeed, that the <HI>filii principum</HI> of Britain u&s;ed the Latin: and it &s;eems to have been ever confined to the upper ranks; for all Roman Britain did not produce one Latin author, tho Spain and Gaul did many; as Mela, Lucan, Seneca, Martial, Sido|nius, Au&s;onius, and others.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER II.</HI> The Tribes between the Tweed and Forth, Solway and Clyde.</HEAD>
<P>THE tribes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing that part of Scotland, which lyes &s;outh of the Clyde and Forth, were Four in number, namely, the <HI>Selgovae, No|vantae, Damnii,</HI> and <HI>Otadeni.</HI> So they &s;tood in Ptolemy's time, who wrote about 150 years after our aera.</P>
<P>That the&s;e tribes were all Cimbric, or Welch, is clear from Gildas, Beda, and others; and from the remains of them in the kingdom of Strat-Clyde. The <HI>Britons</HI> of Gildas and Beda, as all know, are the Welch, the people whom Cae&s;ar thought born in the iland, as the Romans and Saxons knew nothing of the real aborigines, the Gael, who had all been driven to Ireland by the Welch long before the arrival of the former. Now Gildas and Beda mark the Forth and Clyde, as the old boun|daries between the Caledonians or Piks, and the Britons. They are indeed mi&s;taken if they meaned that the&s;e rivers were the boundaries, when Agricola di&s;covered Caledonia to the Romans. For at that time, and till the province of Ve&s;pa&s;iana was abandoned by the Romans, the river Tay, on the ea&s;t; the many lakes Tay, Erne, Veol, Ketterin, Lomond, in the middle; and Loch Fyn, an arm of the &s;ea, on the we&s;t; formed the boundary be|tween the Caledonians or Piks, and Cumraig Bri|tons. Tacitus mentions, that Agricola wa&s;ted the country up to Tay, three years before he marched again&s;t the Caledonians; and after his victory over

<PB N="35" REF="120" MS="Y">Galgacus returned to the country of the Hore&s;ti, in Fife&s;hire, who are not mentioned as Caledonians, Ptolemy al&s;o mentions the Lelamonius Sinus, or Loch Fyn, as the &s;outhern boundary of the Cale|donians. But more of this pre&s;ently, in &s;peaking of the Damnii. After the province Ve&s;pa&s;iana was abandoned, in the &s;econd century, the Caledonians or Piks, &s;eized all the country down to the wall of Antoninus, or Clyde and Forth; whence Gildas and Beda regard the&s;e rivers as the boundary.</P>
<P>Ptolemy's geography of Scotland is peculiarly embarra&s;&s;ed; and, by his bending that country to the ea&s;t, his whole longitudes and latitudes be|come fal&s;e of cour&s;e. Richard of Cirence&s;ter pre|&s;erves the real po&s;ition of the country; but what dependence, in &s;uch matters, can be had upon a writer of the Fourteenth century? He differs from Ptolemy in many e&s;&s;ential points, concerning England and Ireland, as well as Scotland: and, wherever he does &s;o, mu&s;t by every rule of hi&s;toric authority be pre&s;umed in the wrong, for to &s;et his authority again&s;t that of Ptolemy would be the height of ab&s;urdity. All we can do therefore is, to adju&s;t Ptolemy's account as well as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Richard places a fifth tribe, the <HI>Gadeni,</HI> on the &s;outh of the Forth; whereas Ptolemy puts them on the north of Clyde, in pre&s;ent Dunbarton&s;hire. It is &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that Ptolemy mu&s;t be right, and Richard mu&s;t be wrong; for the later com|pared with the former is no authority at all. Pto|lemy's text expre&s;&s;ly bears, that the Gadeni lay to the north of the Damnii, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">; whereas Richard places them on the &s;outh-ea&s;t of the Damnii. Ptolemy &s;uppo&s;es the north, to be the ea&s;t of Scotland; and, of cour&s;e, his <HI>north</HI> is the we&s;t, not the ea&s;t, as Richard infers. By Ptolemy's longitudes and latitudes, and the maps drawn in con&s;equence of his de&s;cription, the Gadeni are on the ea&s;t, that is, the north in reality, of the
<PB N="36" REF="121"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> or Firth of Clyde. Richard makes Curia the town of the Gadeni, whereas Ptolemy gives it to the Otadeni; and i &s;u&s;pect Richard has been mi&s;led by a ha&s;ty peru&s;al of Ptolemy's text, which runs in this order,</P>
<Q>'The Gadeni are more northward: the Otadeni more &s;outh; among whom are the&s;e towns, Curia, Bremenium.'</Q>
<P>All interpreters agree that the&s;e two towns belong to the Otadeni; and not one of them, Curia to the Gadeni, and the other Bremenium, to the Ota|deni, as Richard under&s;tands. From both Pto|lemy and Richard, it is clear, that Curia lay far &s;outh of Forth; and could never belong to the Gadeni, whom Ptolemy places north of Clyde. The po&s;ition of all the other tribes laid down by Ptolemy agrees with Richard, if you only turn up Ptolemy's map, &s;o as to make his ea&s;t the north. One cau&s;e of Richard's error was his taking Curia for a town of the Gadeni, as ju&s;t mentioned. Another is, that he puts the Attacotti too far &s;outh-ea&s;t, in place of Ptolemy's Gadeni, while the Atta|cotti were not in Caledonia till 258, as after &s;hewn, when they came from Ireland; and are unknown in Roman hi&s;tory till the fourth century. Hence Richard, having no room for the Gadeni in their real &s;tation, was forced to imagine another place for them. Whereas, if we &s;uppo&s;e Richard right in placing the Gadeni &s;outh of Forth, a blank will be left in Ptolemy between Clota and Lelamo|nius, while all the re&s;t of his Caledonia is duly filled. No one the lea&s;t ver&s;ant in &s;uch matters, can for a moment put Richard's authority again&s;t Ptolemy's; but, when &s;o many other arguments favour Ptolemy, it would be ab&s;urd even to doubt: and we may regard it as fixt, that the Gadeni were on the north of the Clyde.</P>
<PB N="37" REF="122">
<P>Let us therefor&eacute; con&s;ider the Four Tribes, &s;outh of Forth and Clyde. To begin on the we&s;t &s;ide, and from the &s;outh, fir&s;t were the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>Selgovae,</HI> in, Dunfries-&s;hire, part of Kircudbright, &amp;c. In their territories, Ptolemy mentions the&s;e towns <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>Carbantorigum;</HI> <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>Uxellum;</HI> <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>Corda;</HI> and <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>Trimontium.</HI> The fir&s;t is thought Kircudbright, the &s;econd Ca&s;tle Over; the third was the mo&s;t northern town of the Selgovae, but cannot be fixt; the fourth, it is thought, lay near Eildon Hills, which have three remarkable &s;ummits, and where there are ruins of a Roman &s;tation. Among the Selgovae were al&s;o the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>Ituna ae&s;tuarium,</HI> or Solway Firth; and the rivers <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> and <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>Novius</HI> and <HI>Deva,</HI> or Nith and Dee.</P>
<P>Next on the we&s;t were the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> <HI>Novantae,</HI> in Wigton-&s;hire, and the &s;outh of Air&s;hire; who had two towns <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>Leucopibia,</HI> and <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>Retigonium.</HI> The former certainly Whithern, as Richard rightly &s;ays, Candida Ca&s;a. The &s;econd apparently Stranrawer. The Novantae al&s;o had on the &s;outh the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>Iena ae&s;tuarium,</HI> now Wigton bay; and <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>Abra|annus fluvius,</HI> or more properly <HI>Sinus,</HI> as Richard, now Glenluce bay. On the we&s;t the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>Novantum Cher&s;one&s;us,</HI> now the Rinns of Galloway; the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>Rerigonius Sinus,</HI> now Loch Ryan. As the town Retigonium &s;tood on this bay, and gave it name, either the bay or town is erroneou&s;ly called; and Richard terms the town Rerigonium, rightly as would &s;eem. The Novantae had al&s;o the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>Vidogara Sinus,</HI> believed to be Air Bay.</P>
<P>The <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> <HI>Damnii,</HI> were next on the north of the two former. This nation was by far the mo&s;t important of the four; and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the north of pre&s;ent Air&s;hire, Renfrew, Lanark, Linlithgow, and Stirling, &s;hires. They were the frontier na|tion
<PB N="38" REF="123" MS="Y">of Cumraig Britons; and on the north of them were the Caledonians or Piks. The wall of An|toninus, as is clear from Ptolemy and Richard, ran thro the territories of the Damnii: and the later &s;ays, that the Damnii in con&s;equence lo&s;t all their territory on the north of that wall, which was &s;eized by the Caledonians. The Damnii, by Ptolemy's account, had no le&s;s than &s;ix towns; <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>Colania;</HI> <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>Vanduara;</HI> <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>Coria;</HI> <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>Alauna;</HI> <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>Lindum;</HI> <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>Victoria.</HI> Richard gives the three la&s;t towns to the Hore&s;ti; but adds, that before the wall of Antonine was built, the Hore&s;ti were e&s;teemed part of the Dam|nii. In fact the Hore&s;ti of Tacitus are unknown to Ptolemy, who marks their towns as of the Damnii; and it is apparent, that the Caledonians were not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Fife&s;hire, or the land of the Hore&s;ti, till after the province of Ve&s;pa&s;iana was abandoned. Tacitus mentions, that Agricola wa&s;ted the country up to Tay, three years before he went again&s;t the Caledonians; and that after conquering Galgacus, and his Caledonians, he went back to the lands of the Hore&s;ti, and it ap|pears that the Hore&s;ti were not Caledonians. By Ptolemy's de&s;cription, the Caledonians began on the &s;outh, at the Sinus Lelamonius, or Loch Fyn. Of the above towns Colania is thought Lanerk; Vanduara, Pai&s;ley; Coria, Borthwick Ca&s;tle; Alauna, Kier near Stirling; Lindum, Ardoch; Victoria, Perth, or, according to others, Dalgin Ro&s;s. The <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>Clota ae&s;tuarium,</HI> or firth of Clyde, was in the territory of e Damnii.</P>
<P>The <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> <HI>Otadeni,</HI> were in the Lothians, Berwick&s;hire, Peebles, and Northumberland. They had two towns, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>Curia;</HI> and <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>Breme|nium;</HI> both, as appears from Ptolemy and Richard, &s;outh of Tweed, the former &s;omewhere in Rox|burgh&s;hire; the later is thought Roche&s;ter in Nor|thumberland. It is &s;urprizing that there were no
<PB N="39" REF="124" MS="Y">towns in the Lothians and Berwick&s;hire, now the mo&s;t fertile parts of Scotland. Among the Ota|deni were the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> <HI>Boderia ae&s;tuarium,</HI> or firth of Forth, and river <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>Alaunus,</HI> or Alen in Northumberland.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e tribes it is mo&s;t likely that tho&s;e on the &s;outh and ea&s;t, the Selgovae and Otadeni, were a continuation of tho&s;e Cimbric nations which held all the north of pre&s;ent England. Tho&s;e on the we&s;t, or the Damnii and Novantae, we may well &s;uppo&s;e, were a part of the old Cimbric inhabitants of the whole of Scotland; and who came into the&s;e parts, after their expul&s;ion by the Piks, about 200 years before Chri&s;t, either finding the country vacant, or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Gael, whom they expelled, or being allowed the&s;e provinces by their brethren in the &s;outh. The Damnii were perhaps the Tuath de Dannan, of the Iri&s;h Annals, who pa&s;&s;ed from Scotland into Ireland. The Novantae &s;eem merely a part of the Damnii, as the Trinobantes were of the Belgae, and the Dumnonii of the Silures. The name Novantae, if we for once believe the Celtic etymologi&s;ts, means New-comers; or Stran|gers; and we may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e it given to tho&s;e Cumri of North Britain who fir&s;t came down upon their brethren, the old po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, and of cour&s;e went furthe&s;t to the &s;outh.</P>
<P>Richard places a tribe called <HI>Damnii Albani,</HI> a people, he &s;ays, little known, and &s;urrounded with lakes and mountains, in that part of Scotland, which lyes between Loch Tay, and Loch Lomond; in which indeed there are va&s;t mountains, and about &s;even con&s;iderable lakes, Dochart, Erne, Veol, Lub|nich, Ketterin, Archy, Venachar. It de&s;erves great attention, that the&s;e Damnii Albani, and their neighbours, the <HI>Attacotti,</HI> are the only na|tions to be found in old Scotland which occur in Richard, and not in Ptolemy. This leads us to conclude with certainty, that neither of the&s;e nations
<PB N="40" REF="125">were in Scotland, in Ptolemy's time. The Atta|cotti, as &s;hall be after &s;hewn, were the Dalreudini, or fir&s;t Iri&s;h &s;ettlers, mentioned by Beda, who were really the fir&s;t Iri&s;h Scots; who ever &s;ettled there, and who were thence called by the Britons Atta-Cotti, or Hither-Scots, to di&s;tingui&s;h them from the Scots of Ireland. The fir&s;t &s;ettlement of the Attacotti, or Dalreudini in Scotland, hap|pened about the year 258; and, as the Damnii Albani, and they, are the only nations in all Scot|land mentioned by Richard, but unknown to Ptolemy, it is mo&s;t rea&s;onable to infer, that the&s;e Damnii Albani were a part of the Tuath de Dannan, which returned from Ireland, with the Attacotti, and were called Albani, or Mountaineers, to di&s;|tingui&s;h them from the other Damnii. At the &s;ame time, if any one chu&s;es rather to believe that the&s;e Damnii had, in their country &s;o inacce&s;&s;ible, be|cau&s;e of mountains and lakes, as Richard &s;ays, de|fended them&s;elves again&s;t the Piks; to a late period, there is little objection, &s;ave that this idea is not &s;o probable as the former.</P>
<P>The Selgovae &s;eem to have acknowleged the &s;uperiority of the Brigantes, for in Annandale was found a &s;tatue in&s;cribed to the Godde&s;s Brigantia, as an in&s;cription to her was found near Che&s;ter, another in York&s;hire; but war, or other accidents, may have tran&s;ported the&s;e articles from one coun|try to another. Tacitus informs, us, <HI>in Agricola,</HI> that the Brigantes were the mo&s;t numerous nation in Britain. That is, the Brigantes proper, with the many Celtic tribes &s;ubject to them. The Ro|mans were al&s;o chiefly &s;tationed in their country, along the wall of Hadrian. No wonder, then, that they were more known to the Romans than any people in Britain. Tacitus informs us, that it was in the time of Ve&s;pa&s;ian, that Petilius Cerialis &s;ubdued mo&s;t of the Brigantes. Seneca in flattery a&s;cribes the conque&s;t of the Brigantes to Claudius,

If i mi&s;take not, Tacitus has abridged the fame of Cerealis, thinking thereby to enhance that of Agricola, for he &s;eems to have completely &s;ub|dued the Brigantes.</P>
<P>After the wall of Hadrian was built, about 121, and that of Antoninus, about 140, the new name of MAEATAE begins to ari&s;e for the nations be|tween the&s;e walls. Etymology, when applied to names, which may have that origin among ten thou&s;and which is lea&s;t &s;u&s;pected by us, becomes &s;heer frenzy: that given of Maeatae is plau&s;ible, as all the&s;e Celtic dreamers take care to make their etymologies, knowing that, the more fooli&s;h a pur|&s;uit,
<PB N="42" REF="127">is, it has the more need of a cloke of &s;eeming decency to cover it. They &s;ay that in the Celtic this word means Midlanders, a name which might naturally &s;pring from the &s;itua|tion of the people between the walls, and be|tween Roman Britain on one &s;ide, and Caledonia on the other.</P>
<P>Ptolemy in 150 knew nothing of this new name: and Pau&s;anias, who wrote about the &s;ame time, &s;eems, in total ignorance of Britain, to call the Maeatae Brigantes. In the beginning of the reign of Mar|cus Antoninus, or about the year 164, there were commotions in Britain, which Calphurnius Agri|cola was &s;ent to quell; as we learn from Capito|linus, in his Life of Marcus. It &s;eems probable, that Calphurnius had no &s;ucce&s;s: and that it was at this time that Ve&s;pa&s;iana was left, if not the other province, north of Hadrian's wall. For no in|&s;criptions but of the reign of Pius have been found at his wall; and &s;oon after this, we find the tribes between the walls had thrown off the Roman yoke, and bore the indepen|dent name of Maeatae. Dio, in narrating the reign of Commodus, &s;hews that, about the year 183, both the Caledonians and Maeatae had broken in upon the empire; and, after harra&s;&s;ing the provinces, killed a Roman general who op|po&s;ed them. And that, tho repul&s;ed by the general Marcellus, they continued in arms, till Severus the emperor came him&s;elf in 207 again&s;t them.</P>
<P>In relating the expedition of Severus, Dio men|tions the Maeatae: and de&s;cribes them and the Caledonians as the only nations in Britain not &s;ubject to Rome. The former acted under the pro|tection of the later. Severus over-ran both the Maeatae and Caledonians, tho with the almo&s;t incre|dible lo&s;s of 50,000 men<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Dio lib. 76. but Dio is a fal&s;e and ignorant author.</NOTE>: a lo&s;s which no Roman
<PB N="43" REF="128">army ever &s;u&s;tained in any other expedition. Yet was he hardly returned to York, when the Cale|donians fir&s;t, as Dio &s;ays, and then the Maeatae, were again in arms. Invincible nations, will &s;ome &s;ay, and worthy to contend with Rome! But a more &s;ober reader will rather with that, for the la&s;ting advantage of Scotland, every part of it had received, along with the yoke, the cultivation of Rome.</P>
<P>Severus dying at York in 211, his &s;on Caracalla made a di&s;graceful peace with the Caledonians and Maeatae. "From that time forward," &s;ays Innes, "it appears the Caledonians po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of a part of the lands of the Maeatae, or, rather united to the Maeatae, &s;hared in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, to the &s;outh of the firths, till Theodo&s;ius re|duced that country into a province about 370." I wi&s;h this accurate writer had mentioned his au|thority for this idea; for my part, i know of none: but this mu&s;t be examined when we come to &s;peak of the extent of the Piki&s;h dominions.</P>
<P>Certain it is, that we find no mention of the Maeatae after this peace of Caracalla; hardly any thing being to be found concerning Britain, till 360, when we find the Piks acting in conjunc|tion with the Scots or Iri&s;h. About the year 290, Carau&s;ius, and after him Con&s;tantius Chlo|rus, are &s;aid to have carried on war in the north of Britain. For the former we have no better authority than Nennius: but the later might be &s;hewn from the Panegyrics. The Bri|tons &s;ubdued by Con&s;tantius were in all ap|pearance the Maeatae; and being neare&s;t the Roman provinces, they mu&s;t have borne the whole brunt of war; and appear, by this con|flict, and irregular incur&s;ions of the Romans in|to their country, to have been extremely di|mini&s;hed, and confined to the north parts along the friths. The Piks upon this had recour&s;e
<PB N="44" REF="129">to the alliance of the Old Scots of Ireland; and the Maeatae &s;eem to have had no further con|cern in their expeditions, than by allowing them to pa&s;s their grounds into the Roman terri|tory. About 370, Theodo&s;ius erecting the coun|try of the Maeatae into the province of Valen|tia, the remains of the&s;e people &s;oon became as peaceable as the &s;outhern Britons.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER III. <HI>The Walls.</HI></HEAD>
<P>INNES, in his laudable Critical E&s;&s;ay on the Ancient Inhabitants of North Britain, has given an accurate account of the Roman Walls in Britain; and i &s;hall in this li&s;t do little more than follow him. The&s;e walls were in two di&s;tant places; namely, between the Clyde and Forth, and between the Solway and Tine. The la&s;t pro|perly belongs to England; but, as there is a nece&s;|&s;ary connection between them, both &s;hall be con|&s;idered together in chronological order.</P>
<P N="1">1. Agricola, as Tacitus informs in his life, rai&s;ed a line of forts between the firths of Clyde and of Forth, <HI>Glotta</HI> and <HI>Bodotria.</HI> So that <HI>&s;ummotis velut in aliam in&s;ulam ho&s;tibus,</HI> 'the enemies being removed as into another i&s;land<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">We are not hereby to under&s;tand that this line of forts formed the frontier between the Southern Britons and Caledonians; for the later held only down to Tay and Loch Fyn, as above &s;hewn. If Richard may be tru&s;ted, Agri|cola built Victoria on the Tay: and the &s;pace between the line of Forts and the Caledonians was &s;urely, at any rate, an advanced frontier, guarded by &s;tations of light troops, as was afterward the ca&s;e when the wall of Antoninus was built.</NOTE>,' the whole of Bri|tain &s;outh of the&s;e firths &s;hould be regarded as a quiet province. This was in the year 81.</P>
<P N="2">2. That frontier was quickly lo&s;t, and Hadrian thought proper, in the year 121, to build a wall between Solway and Tine, thus retiring eighty miles. That Hadrian's wall &s;tood here is clear from Spartian, who &s;ays it was eighty miles long, whereas the &s;pace between Clyde and Forth ex|ceeds not thirty. Nor has the &s;ituation of this
<PB N="46" REF="131" MS="Y">wall been que&s;tioned; as in&s;criptions put it beyond a doubt.</P>
<P N="3">3. ANTONINUS PIUS recovered the fir&s;t barrier by the great &s;ucce&s;s of Lollius Urbicus his general; and a wall was built on the line of Agricola's forts, between the Clyde and Forth. This wall of Antoni|nus, built about the year 140, was &s;oon abandoned, for, as Hor&s;ley ob&s;erves, not an in&s;cription has ever been found near it but what refers to Antoni|nus Pius and his reign.</P>
<P N="3">4. In 210 Severus again withdrew the boundary, and built a new wall between Solway and Tine. For that this was the place of his wall appears from the hi&s;torians, as Innes &s;hews. Buchanan, and others, are therefore mi&s;taken in placing it between Clyde and Forth.</P>
<P N="5">5. In 367, the emperor Valentinian I. &s;ent over Theodo&s;ius his general (father of Theo|do&s;ius I.) to Britain, again&s;t the Piks and Scots; who not only repelled them, but &s;eized on the lands between the walls, and erected them into a province by the name of Valentia. He &s;trongly fortified it's northern border, between Clyde and Forth; and, as Richard &s;ays, built Theodo&s;ia, or Dunbarton, as a &s;trong hold and frontier town. Hence this was con&s;idered by Beda, and others, as the grand limit between the Britons and Piks.</P>
<P N="6">6. Stilicho, as Claudian informs, added fortifica|tions to this barrier, about 398.</P>
<P N="7">7. The Romans having abandoned Britain about the year 409, the Britons, about 421, reque&s;ted their a&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the Piks and Scots. They arrived, and repelled the enemy; and cau&s;ed the Britons to build a turf wall on the march, between Clyde and Forth, as the former had been thrown down. Beda, <HI>lib.</HI> I. <HI>c.</HI> 12. gives a di&s;tinct ac|count of this wall, which reached from Alcluyd, or Dunbarton, to a place about two miles we&s;t of Abercorn, called, as Beda &s;ays, Peanvahel in the Piki&s;h tongue, Peneltun in Saxon. Nennius
<PB N="47" REF="132">&s;ays, it was called Pengaaul (in Briti&s;h), Cenail in Scoti&s;h, or Iri&s;h, Peneltun in Engli&s;h: this place where the wall ends, is now, as Gordon &s;ays, called Cair-in, and is ju&s;t two miles we&s;t of Abercorn. But Gordon confounds the wall of Antoninus with this wall.</P>
<P N="8">8. The la&s;t, and mo&s;t important, wall ever built in Britain, according to Beda's account, was that rai&s;ed by the Romans, who again under the command of GALLIO came to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Britons again&s;t their old enemies, the Piks and Scots, about the year 426. This was of &s;olid &s;tone, and built between the Solway and Tine, as Beda &s;ays; who adds that it ran hard by Hagu&s;taldum, or Hexham, in Northumberland. Gildas<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Cap. 14. murum (non ut alterum) SUMPTU PUBLICO PRIVATOQUE, adjunctis &s;ecum mi&s;erabilibus indigenis, &s;olito &s;tructurae more, tramite a mari, &amp;c. This pa&s;&s;age, like all the dark Celtic work of Gildas, is confu&s;ed and ob&s;cure <HI>non ut alterum</HI> refers to the turf wall, cap. 12. <HI>&s;olito,</HI> i &s;u&s;pect, &s;hould be <HI>&s;olido.</HI> Beda u&s;es the words of Gildas, <HI>a mari ad mare recto tramite inter urbes,</HI> &amp;c. and adds FIRMO DE LAPIDE. Gildas de&s;cribing the turf wall, 421, c. 12. &s;ays, it was erected <HI>trans in&s;ulam;</HI> and Keith, in the preface to his Scoti&s;h Bi&s;hops, fooli&s;hly infers thence, that Caledonia was con&s;idered as ano|ther iland; forgetting that <HI>trans</HI> implies <HI>acro&s;s,</HI> as well as <HI>be|yond.</HI> Our antiqui&s;ts ought to be advi&s;ed, not to apply cla&s;&s;ic interpretation to writers not cla&s;&s;ic; but to &s;tudy the <HI>media et infima Latinitas.</HI></NOTE> &s;ays of this wall, that it pa&s;&s;ed <HI>a mari u&s;que ad mare, inter urbes quae ibidem forte ob metum ho&s;tium collocatae fue|runt,</HI> 'from &s;ea to &s;ea among the towns which had been erected there, for fear of the enemy.' The&s;e towns were the, Roman &s;tations on the &s;outhern wall.</P>
<P>Thus, of the&s;e walls, FIVE were on the Northern frontier, or between the Clyde and Forth in Scot|land: and THREE were in England, between Sol|way and Tine.</P>
<P>The&s;e Three Southern Walls were rai&s;ed by Hadrian, Severus, and Gallio: the fir&s;t as would &s;eem of turf; for Capitolinus, mentioning the wall
<PB N="48" REF="133">of Pius, &s;ays, <HI>alio muro ce&s;pititio,</HI> 'another turf wall,' which implies the former, or that of Hadrian, to have been al&s;o of turf. The&s;e turf walls had foundations, and towers of &s;tone; and large ditches. The wall of Severus was thought to be of &s;tone, as Aurelius Victor puts it as a greater work than all his conque&s;ts; which would have been ridiculous, if he only repaired the turf wall of Hadrian. If &s;o, Gallio &s;eems only to have repaired the wall of Severus. But of this after.</P>
<P>The Five Northern Walls begin with Agricola's line of forts, then the turf wall of Antoninus; next that of Theodo&s;ius, which &s;eems but a reparation; the additional forts of Stilicho; and the turf wall of the Britons. There never was a &s;tone wall here; and that a&s;cribed to Severus &s;eems the only &s;tone wall erected.</P>
<P>The wall of Severus is a &s;ingular monument; for, tho he had penetrated to the very extremity of Caledonia, yet he was contented to re&s;ign a large tract of country; while there &s;eems no rea&s;on again&s;t his building the wall at the Northern fron|tier. The glory of building a long wall certainly was not equal to the &s;hame of re&s;igning a territory; &s;o that vanity could not be his inducement. Yet his hi&s;torians &s;ay he acquired territory. A palpa|ble contradiction! If any writer were to deny that Severus built any wall, it would be difficult to an|&s;wer him; for certain it is, that both Herodian and Dio, who wrote &s;o near his time, are utterly &s;ilent about this glory of his reign. Spartian, a weak writer in the time of Diocletian, near a cen|tury after Severus, is the fir&s;t who mentions it; and what the &s;tate of hi&s;toric knowlege then was may be judged from the beginning of the life of Probus, by Vopi&s;cus, in the &s;ame Collection<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Augu&s;tae Scriptores.</NOTE>. Vopi&s;cus is the be&s;t of the&s;e authors, and lived un|der Diocletian; and he &s;ays that, for want of writers,
<PB N="49" REF="134">the actions and memory of Probus had almo&s;t peri&s;hed! That is in a &s;pace of <HI>twelve or fourteen</HI> years!</P>
<P>Yet it mu&s;t be con&s;idered, that the tract be|tween the walls might be regarded it&s;elf as a real advanced frontier, to be inhabited by his &s;ubjects, at their ri&s;k, but upon no account to be entered by the enemy. The&s;e Roman Walls &s;eem by no means to have been the direct and ab&s;olute frontiers, but only protections for the agricultors, and peaceful &s;ubjects. Beyond them were appa|rently exploratory camps, and &s;tations; and large bodies of men, who lived by hunting and fi&s;hing, and had no property to rai&s;e their fears. If we tru&s;t Richard, there was a whole province, Ve&s;|pa&s;iana, beyond the wall of Antoninus. Hor&s;ley ob&s;erves, from in&s;criptions, &amp;c. that the Romans, even in the time of Severus, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed grounds north of his wall. According to all appearance therefore, tho Severus might build this wall, yet he regarded that of Antoninus as the actual direct frontier. He might build his wall, to pro|tect the cultivated lands; leaving his &s;oldiers, and &s;ome roving Britons, to guard them&s;elves, without the wall, or within it, at plea&s;ure. Caracalla was forced after his father's death, in 211, to make a di&s;graceful peace with the Caledonians; and to give up part of what his father had gained<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Mr. Gordon, in his Itinerarium Septentrionale, takes the Catrail, running from Melro&s;e, &s;outhwe&s;t, for the boundary fixt by Caracalla; but it is nece&s;&s;ary to inform the reader, that Gordon unhappily took a way for a wall. See Remarks on the Catrail, in the <HI>Reliquiae Galcanae.</HI> General Roy, who has examined the Roman antiquities in Scotland with great care, found no wall where Gordon marks; but a military road. See his De&s;cription of Roman Antiquities in Scotland, with fine drawings, MS. in the Royal Library, 2 vols. folio.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Northern frontier was never held for any time. The forts of Agricola were abandoned in a &s;hort &s;pace. Hadrian, in 121, built the South wall. Antoninus, after the Piks had been driven back,
<PB N="50" REF="135">built the North wall, about 140, which &s;eems to have remained the barrier only for about the re|maining &s;pace of his reign, or 21 years, for no later in&s;criptions have been found. In 211 Cara|calla withdrew the frontier. In 367 it was fir&s;t placed for any time at the Northern wall, and continued till 426, when it was again drawn South.</P>
<P>Theodo&s;ius, in 367, may be regarded as the chief acquirer of the territory between the walls; and he erected it into a province, which was held till the Romans finally abandoned Britain. After the Chri&s;tian religion was embraced by Con&s;tan|tine, few or no Roman in&s;criptions are to be found, as may be &s;een in Gruter. It is therefore no wonder that no in&s;criptions of, or after, the time of Theodo&s;ius &s;hould be found in the north fron|tier; nor of, or after, that of Gallio in the &s;outh.</P>
<P>Mr. Whitaker has &s;hewn that the Roman walls were by no means the po&s;itive boundaries of the Roman domain, in Britain. But his arguments are a little confu&s;ed, for no one ever doubted, that Valentia was held by the Romans till their final departure. The point was to &s;hew, that the Romans had &s;tations and &s;ettlements beyond what was regarded as the barrier; as beyond the wall of Antoninus, during the reign of Antoninus, and beyond that of Hadrian in his reign. Hor&s;ley has &s;hewn in particular, that Netherby, to the north of Hadrian's wall, was a Roman &s;tation, in the reign of that emperor. If we believe Richard, the Province Ve&s;pa&s;iana exi&s;ted beyond the wall of Antoninus: but few Roman in&s;criptions have been found to the north of this wall. Arthur's Oven, a Roman work, &s;tood to the north of it. But this mu&s;t be examined when we come to &s;peak of the province Ve&s;pa&s;iana. We know not what force was &s;tationed at the wall of Antoninus in his time. Nay, what is mo&s;t puzzling, tho we might believe, that, after Theodo&s;ius founded the
<PB N="51" REF="136" MS="Y">province of Valentia, and he and Stilicho fortified it's northern frontier, the chief Roman force &s;hould have been maintained at this frontier; yet from the Notitia and Itineraries, if we tru&s;t modern interpretation, it appears that the whole Roman troops were &s;till &s;tationed at the wall of Severus. The rea&s;ons of antiquaries are often fanta&s;tic; and it may be &s;trongly &s;u&s;pected that the &s;tations men|tioned in the Notitia, as <HI>per line am valli,</HI> were along the Northern frontier, and the coa&s;t oppo&s;ite to Ireland. Certain it is, that the <HI>Vallum</HI> of Richard and the Itinerary, a&s;cribed to an Antoninus, but written in the fourth or fifth century, is the Northern frontier; not the Southern, which was called <HI>Murus,</HI> as <HI>Ad Murum,</HI> or Newca&s;tle, &amp;c. and it is mo&s;t rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that, in the Notitia, <HI>Vallum</HI> has the &s;ame acceptation.</P>
<P>If the reader will carefully examine tho&s;e who have placed the&s;e &s;tations at the wall of Severus, he will find that they have not even a &s;hadow of foundation. Hor&s;ley and Warburton<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Mr. Warburton (not the bi&s;hop) in his Vallum Romanum or Picts Wall, London, 1753, 4to. The title is improper, for the Wall of Antoninus was &s;pecially called <HI>Vallum;</HI> that of Severus, as imagined, or Picts Wall, was termed <HI>Murus.</HI></NOTE> have &s;aid all that can be &s;tated on this &s;ubject; and they &s;eem to have taken the matter for granted. The &s;ole <HI>coincidences</HI> (for they cannot be called argu|ments) which they produce, are, that by beginning the &s;tations in the Notitia at the ea&s;t end of the Wall, they find in&s;criptions by two troops, the <HI>Cohors Prima Tungrorum,</HI> and the <HI>Prima Aelia Dacorum,</HI> at places which, by their account, an&s;wer to <HI>Borcovicum</HI> and <HI>Amboglanna,</HI> where the&s;e troops are placed in the Notitia. But unhappily this ar|gument will weigh nothing, when we reflect that the&s;e very in&s;criptions are dedicative of altars to Jupiter, and other gods; and by the form of the letters, and other marks, &s;eem as early as Hadrian's reign. At any rate, they mu&s;t have preceded the
<PB N="52" REF="137" MS="Y">Notitia by more than a century; for after Con|&s;tantine I. the whole armies of Rome were Chri&s;|tian, as appears from the <HI>labarum</HI> on medals, and many other tokens; and no altars to heathen gods could be erected. So that the&s;e coincidences are matters of chance, not of argument; tho indeed it be much to be &s;u&s;pected that the in&s;criptions led to the idea of fixing the troops at the &s;tations. And it mu&s;t be added, that an in&s;cription by one of the&s;e troops was found at the other end of the wall; for which Hor&s;ley accounts, by &s;aying it was fir&s;t Rationed there, and after moved. In|&s;criptions, by no le&s;s than three of the cohorts mentioned in the Notitia, have unluckily been al&s;o found along the wall of Scotland; namely the <HI>Prima Batavorum,</HI> the <HI>Prima Hi&s;panorum,</HI> and the <HI>Prima Tungrorum.</HI></P>
<P>Arguments there al&s;o are for the &s;tations in the Notitia not being at the Southern Frontier, For
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Not one name of a &s;tation in the Notitia in the lea&s;t coincides with the modern ones in Northum|land.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Not one in&s;cription can be found which mentions the name of a &s;ingle &s;tation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>Lugu|vallium,</HI> the greate&s;t nation on the Southern Fron|tier, is not to be found in the Notitia; and Hor&s;|ley, &amp;c. are obliged to &s;uppo&s;e it alone de&s;erted!</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. <HI>Pons Aelii</HI> never was a name for Newca&s;tle, which in all the Itineraries is called <HI>Ad Murum.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST> The&s;e arguments are &s;ufficient to &s;hew that there is no foundation for placing the&s;e &s;tations at the Southern frontier; and the two la&s;t &s;eem to evince that they could not be there.</P>
<P>Other arguments might al&s;o be brought for the&s;e Stations of the Notitia being along the Northern Frontier; for the Province of Valentia was founded in 367; and it appears from Beda and others, that it was kept till the Romans left Britain about 409, and &s;ome years after: it is rea|&s;onable to infer, that the fortified frontier, or <HI>Val|lum,</HI> when the Notitia was compiled, was to the
<PB N="53" REF="138">north of this province. It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that a &s;ingle trace, or in&s;cription of the&s;e troops, can be found, for hardly an in&s;cription appears after Con&s;tantine I. thro the whole Roman empire. Be&s;ide, they only continued forty years; whereas, had they remained at the &s;outhern frontier for three centuries, as &s;uppo&s;ed, it might be expected that the name of &s;ome one &s;tation, in the Notitia, might have found it's way into an in&s;cription, or the Itineraries; but this is not the ca&s;e. On the whole, the point with regard to the&s;e &s;tations of the Notitia &s;tands thus:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Antiquaries have taken it into their heads, that they were at the Southern Wall; but this is no argument.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. As they manage the matter, two in&s;criptions have been found, which coincide as above &s;tated; but they are obliged to pa&s;s one which is fully again&s;t them: and three in&s;criptions of the &s;ame troops have been found in Scotland, which more than balance the others.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. There are po&s;itive and direct argu|ments, that the <HI>Vallum</HI> of the Notitia is not the Southern barrier, for No <HI>Luguvallium,</HI> tho the mo&s;t noted &s;tation on that barrier, is mentioned in the Notitia, and No <HI>Ad Murum,</HI> or Newca&s;tle.</ITEM>
</LIST> And there is no argument whatever again&s;t it's being the Northern: for Theodo&s;ia, or Dunbar|ton, is beyond the end of the wall which is at Dunglas: and the &s;tations, if in Scotland, mu&s;t have run &s;outh of the two firths of Clyde and Forth.</P>
<P>It is a pity this point is rather uncertain, for if the &s;tations were really on the Northern barrier, as &s;eems mo&s;t rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, antiquaries have hitherto been much mi&s;taken. And if they were on the Southern, it would be a mo&s;t curious fact; as it would &s;hew that the Romans did not fortify the extremity of their real po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, but had actually a military pro|vince beyond the wall at all tunes; as Ve&s;pa|&s;iana,
<PB N="54" REF="139" MS="Y">beyond the wall of Antoninus; and Valentia, beyond that of Hadrian.</P>
<P>Upon the mo&s;t mature examination i am fully convinced, that Severus built no wall in Britain, nor rai&s;ed any rampart. Dio and Herodian, who lived near his time, both writing under Alexander Severus, about twelve years after the death of Severus, tho they narrate his life and &s;malle&s;t actions at great length, are quite &s;ilent as to this. Spar|tian, who wrote in a mo&s;t ignorant age, about a hundred years after, is the fir&s;t who mentions it; and he is followed by Aurelius Victor, and others. All hi&s;torians agree that Severus gained territory, &s;o that he could not withdraw the frontier. Tho the wall be of &s;olid &s;tone, and a &s;urprizing monu|ment of Roman power, yet is there not the &s;mal|le&s;t in&s;cription to be found in honour of Severus; while, in the Northern turf wall, the in&s;criptions in honour of Antoninus Pius are numerous. Only one in&s;cription mentioning Severus has been found in Northumberland, or, as is believed, in Britain; and it is N^o 109 in Hor&s;ley, which was di&s;covered at Hexham, con&s;iderably &s;outh of the wall: and it only refers to building force fort or temple. The in&s;criptions in the wall, and it's ruins, refer almo&s;t wholly to the Centuries, and Cohorts, who built it; and they are &s;hort as CENT. V. or the like, and rudely engraved. For the&s;e rea&s;ons i lend full a&s;&s;ent to Beda, that this &s;tone wall was built by Gallio; tho that venerable writer be mi&s;taken, in &s;aying that Severus had formerly rai&s;ed a turf rampart here, following in this the errors of Spartian and Victor. As to the Welch name of <HI>Gual Sever,</HI> which, it is &s;aid, they give to the wall in the north of England, it is al|&s;o given to that between the firths of Scotland; and vulgar appellations are &s;o vague and fooli&s;h, that no man of &s;ound &s;en&s;e can re&s;t even a &s;traw upon them. I am convinced therefore that there are but two lines of fortification here; namely,
<PB N="55" REF="140">that of Hadrian, of turf and &s;tone, with double ditches before it; and that of Gallio, of &s;olid free &s;tone, near eight feet thick, rai&s;ed by the joint contributions of the Britons, who &s;acrificed to their fears every con&s;ideration of expence. They &s;oon found that no walls can defend cowardice; and ought to have remembered the Spartan apophthegm of Age&s;ilaus, who, being a&s;ked where were the walls of Sparta, pointed to his &s;oldiers, and &s;aid <HI>There.</HI></P>
<P>The Northern barrier more peculiarly con|cerns my pre&s;ent labour. If the reader wi&s;hes to &s;ee plans and de&s;criptions at large, he is referred to Gordon's Itinerarium Septentrionale, or Hor&s;|ley's Britannia Romana. It &s;hall only be here re|marked, that it is of turf, upon a &s;tone founda|tion; and is about Four Yards thick. It can be traced from Dunglas, near Dunbarton, to Cair|iden, two miles ea&s;t of Kinneil. The in&s;criptions found near it are far &s;uperior in elegance to tho&s;e found in the Southern frontier. Hor&s;ley al&s;o ob|&s;erves, that they much excell the later in two other re&s;pects; becau&s;e they mention the emperor by who&s;e order the wall was built; and the quan|tity done at each part, by each legion, or vexilla|tion. The Legions employed were the XXth <HI>Valens Victrix,</HI> the IId <HI>Augu&s;ta,</HI> and the VIth <HI>Victrix.</HI> Three legions, if complete with the auxiliaries of each, &amp;c. would amount to Thirty|&s;ix Thou&s;and men. The in&s;criptions found along the wall of Antoninus were numerous in Hor&s;ley's time, or fifty years ago: &s;ince the canal was dug, they are much encrea&s;ed. The in&s;criptions found in Northumberland equal in number tho&s;e of Cumberland, and all the re&s;t of England, put to|gether. Tho&s;e found along the wall of Antoninus will now equal tho&s;e found in Northumberland, or half of tho&s;e found in all England. Had Severus, who&s;e medals are &s;o fine and various, and to whom, as now di&s;covered, the pillar
<PB N="56" REF="141">called Pompey's, at Alexandria, was erected by one city, had he built this wall, every part of it would have been filled with his glory; whereas, not one hint can be, found from in&s;criptions that this va&s;t work is his. Rea&s;on, as well as the au|thority of Beda, will therefore vindicate our a&s;cribing this prodigious monument to Gallio, and the fears of the Britons: for fear is, of all pa&s;&s;ions, the mo&s;t extravagant, and will throw even gold and diamonds into the &s;ea.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER IV.</HI> The Province of Valentia.</HEAD>
<P>THE hi&s;tory of afrontier is ever confu&s;ed. The perpetual changes it undergoes, like the waves of a troubled ocean, prevent any di&s;|tinct reflection of the &s;un of truth. A &s;ilent de&s;ert, or a &s;cene of blood; or now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by one nation, now by another; it is impo&s;&s;ible to derive order from confu&s;ion, or knowlege where materials mu&s;t be wanting.</P>
<P>The &s;outhern part of Scotland, from the rivers Clyde and Forth, to tho&s;e of Solway and Tyne, thus including al&s;o a part of Northumberland, may be regarded, during the Roman times, as merely a large frontier. About the year 78, the nations who held it, namely the Selgovae, No|vantes, Damnii, and Otadeni, had either been vanqui&s;hed by Cerealis, or had voluntarily &s;ub|mitted to Agricola. A great part of the Damnii, and Brigantes, now went into Ireland, as Richard &s;ays; and as the names given by Ptolemy and him prove.</P>
<P>Britain, being effectually &s;ubdued by Agricola, &s;eems to have remained quiet till the reign of Hadrian, or about forty years. In the begin|ning of Hadrian's reign, as his biographer<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Spartian. apud. Hi&s;t. Aug. Script.</NOTE> &s;ays, the Britons could not be kept under the Roman power: and Richard tells us that both the pro|vinces Ve&s;pa&s;iana and Maeata were then broken. In 121, he built the &s;outhern wall, &s;eeming
<PB N="58" REF="143">&s;ilently to relinqui&s;h both the&s;e provinces. But nineteen years after Antoninus Pius recovered Maeata; and built his wall on the northern fron|tier.</P>
<P>About the year 164 Calphurnius Agricola was &s;ent into Britain, by Marcus Antoninus, to quell &s;ome commotions<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Imminebat etiam Britannicum bellum; et Catti in Ger|maniam ac Rhetiam irruperant. Et adver&s;us Britannos qui|dem Calphurnius Agricola mi&s;&s;us e&s;t; contra Cattos Aufidius Victorinus. Capitolinus in Marco, ib.</NOTE>, apparently in the north; but his &s;ucce&s;s is doubtful, for no in&s;criptions but of Pius occur in the Northern Wall; &s;o that it would &s;eem that all between the walls was now lo&s;t. In the time of Commodus, about 183, the Maeatae were again in arms; and continued not only in freedom, but to in&s;ult the &s;outhern frontier, till Severus arrived in 207. In 211 Caracalla &s;eems to have left the Maeatae in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this province; for it is clear from in&s;criptions, that the Roman forces continued at the &s;outhern bar|rier.</P>
<P>About 290 Con&s;tantius &s;eems to have reduced the Maeatae; and their numbers appear to have been much dimini&s;hed, for, when we again find Briti&s;h affairs mentioned, their name never occurs. We have indeed no mention of the Maeatae after 211; but this is owing to the &s;ilence of Roman writers concerning Britain, from 211 to 360, &s;ave a few hints of the Panegyrics.</P>
<P>In 360, we learn from Ammianus<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Lib. XXVI. XXVII. XXVIII.</NOTE>, that the Scots and Piks were wa&s;ting the parts of Britain next to the frontier. And in 364 he &s;ays the Piks, Saxons, Scots, and Attacots, mole&s;ted the Britons with con&s;tant incur&s;ions: and in 367 that the Piks, divided into two nations, the Dicaledones and Vecturiones, and al&s;o the Attacots, wa&s;ted the Briti&s;h provinces. When Theodo&s;ius, the general, arrived, about the later year, he found the
<PB N="59" REF="144">Piks and Attacots advanced even to London and Kent. Driving them back, he pur&s;ued them to the firths; and, recovering all the land between the walls, he made it a province, under the new name of VALENTIA, from Valens the emperor.</P>
<P>This province remained in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Romans forty-two years, till 409, when they left Britain. Upon this the Piks and Scots ru&s;hed in, and again ravaged all till 421, when the Romans a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Britons to repell them; and the Bri|tons again built or repaired the wall between Clyde and Forth, as Beda &s;hews. But this barrier had no avail: and, about five years after, the Romans under Gallio came, for the la&s;t time, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Britons, and built the grand wall between Solway and Tine. The Piks and Scots then &s;eized on all Valentia up to the new wall, as Beda<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Revertuntur ergo impudentes gra&s;&s;atores Hiberni domum, po&s;t non multum tempus rever&s;uri.

<P>WE are now arrived at the mo&s;t ob&s;cure and difficult part of the whole Scoti&s;h hi&s;tory: and as i have in con&s;equence given it the greate&s;t labour and attention, &s;o i mu&s;t de&s;ire the reader to watch my &s;teps with a &s;evere eye; and judge for him&s;elf, on the materials which &s;hall here be fur|ni&s;hed with the utmo&s;t impartiality, and which, it is pre&s;umed, are all that can be found upon this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>As i &s;hall in this chapter, for the fir&s;t time, quote the ancient Lives of Saints, i mu&s;t reque&s;t the reader to ob&s;erve that this evidence is univer&s;ally ad|mitted by the learned of all countries and religions, as irrefragable with regard to hi&s;toric and geogra|phic facts. And rightly; for there could be no po&s;&s;ible temptation to fiction in the&s;e articles: but, on the contrary, every inducement to pre&s;erve the&s;e grand features exactly, in order to colour their ridiculous tales. A Life of a Saint may be regarded as a religious novel; in which, tho the miracles be fiction, the geography and hi&s;tory are always real. In the grand Collection of the French Hi&s;torians, executed with a care and magnificence worthy of a great nation, extracts from the ancient Lives of Saints are in&s;erted under each century, or divi&s;ion, as equal vouchers with the ancient hi&s;torians: and in that of the Dani&s;h hi&s;torians, tho executed by prote&s;tants, in a prote&s;tant country, the &s;ame plan is followed.

<PB N="61" REF="146" MS="Y">this &s;ubject in the preface, let us return to our pre&s;ent point, after premi&s;ing that the reader mu&s;t not confound the kingdom of Strat-Clyde, the object of this chapter, with that of Cumbria, the object of the next: for, tho this has almo&s;t uni|ver&s;ally been done hitherto, it is an error as &s;hall pre&s;ently be &s;hewn. The kingdom of Strat-Clyde included only Dunbarton, Renfrew, and the upper part of Lanerk-&s;hire. That of Cumbria com|prized Cumberland and We&s;tmoreland in England. A &s;pace of only &s;ixty miles lay between them; and it is no wonder that this proximity has occa&s;ioned their being confounded, as the materials concern|ing them are &s;o barren.</P>
<P>In this chapter i &s;hall fir&s;t produce all the au|thorities which can be found concerning the king|dom of Strat-Clyde; and then offer a few remarks. To proceed according to the chronological order of the writers quoted:</P>
<P N="1">1. Adomnan, elected Abbot of Hyona in 679, wrote the life of St. Columba, the converter of the northern Piks, in three books. In book I. of the MS. in the royal library, written in the 13th century, the fourteenth chapter runs thus:
<Q>'A prophecy of the holy man, concerning king Roderc, the Son of Totail, who reigned at Petra Cloithe<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">De Rege RODERCO, filio Totail, qui Petra Cloithe regna|vit beati viri prophecia. Al&s;o IDEM in tempore, &amp;c. <HI>MS.</HI> in Bibl. Reg. 8 D. IX.</NOTE>,' <HI>(the rock of Clyde.)</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The &s;ame [Roderc] being a friend of the Saint [Columba] &s;ent, at another time, a &s;ecret me&s;&s;age to him by Lugbeus Mocumin, wi&s;hing to know if he &s;hould be &s;lain by his enemies, or not. Lugbeus, being a&s;ked by the Saint con|cerning the &s;ame king, his kingdom and people, an&s;wered as in pity, Why do you a&s;k me about this wretch, who can by no means know what hour he &s;hall be &s;lain by his enemies? The &s;aint upon this &s;aid, He &s;hall never be delivered into
<PB N="62" REF="147">the hands of his enemies, but &s;hall die in his hou&s;e upon his own pillow. Which prophecy of the &s;aint concerning the king was fulfilled. For, according to his word, he died an ea&s;y death &endq;in his own hou&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved upon this quotation, that the titles of all the chapters of this work are in|fallibly put by Adomnan him&s;elf; for, without them, the chapters would often be unintelligible, as the above, among many, may &s;hew; for Roderc is never mentioned before or after, and the beginning of the chapter refers to its title: as do many others in the work. Adomnan is indeed &s;o exact, that, at the end of this performance, we find a &s;olemn injunction<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Admonitio Adomnani ad Scriptores. Ob&s;ecro eos qui|cunque voluerunt hos de&s;cribere libellos, imo potius adjuro per Chri&s;tum judicem &s;aeculorum, ut, po&s;tea diligenter de|&s;crip&s;erint, conferant, et emendant, cum omni diligentia, ad exemplar unde extraxerunt; et hanc quoque adjurationem hoc in loco &s;ub&s;cribant.

Yet has this work been altered in &s;ome parts; a few chapters being omit|ted in the MS. from which Cani&s;ius printed it, which are to be found here; and a few are omitted here, which may be found in Cani&s;ius. The work, when complete, contained all to be found, either in Cani&s;ius, or in this MS. as is evident from the &s;tyle, and connexion; and a genuine edition &s;hould be of equal extent, but ought chiefly to follow this MS. which is mo&s;t ancient and correct.</P>
<P N="2">2. Beda, who wrote in 731, mentions Alcluith, or Petra Cluith, as remaining, in his time, in the hands of the Britons<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Civitas Britonum muniti&s;&s;ima u&s;que hodie quae vocatur Alcluith. I. 1. Alcluith, quod lingua eorum &s;ignificat Petram Cluith; e&s;t enim juxta fluvium nominis illius. I. 12. <HI>et vide</HI> IV. 26.</NOTE>. He &s;ays it &s;tood upon a
<PB N="63" REF="148" MS="Y">river of the &s;ame name, the Cluith, or Clyde; and his de&s;cription is well known to refer to Dun|barton.</P>
<P N="3">3. The life of Gildas, publi&s;hed by Mabillon, from a MS. in the library of Fleury Abbey, men|tions that Gildas was born at Arclyd (read Alclyd) or Dunbritton; and that his father Caunus, or, as others call him, Navus, was king of that country, and was &s;ucceeded by his &s;on Hoel<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Vide U&s;&s;erii Antiq. Eccl. Brit.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="4">4. A&s;&s;er, who wrote his life of Alfred, about the year 900, narrates, that in 875, Healftene, with one half of the Dani&s;h army, marched into Northumberland, and wintered near the river Tine. That he &s;ubdued all Northumberland, and wa&s;ted the lands of the Piks, and <HI>Stratduten&s;es.</HI> Read, as all other authors write, <HI>Stratcluten&s;es,</HI> or tho&s;e of Strat-Clyde; the <HI>c</HI> and <HI>l</HI> having coale&s;ced into a <HI>d.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. The Saxon Chronicle, which was written by different hands, from the Eleventh century, down to the Twelfth, throws &s;everal minute lights on the pre&s;ent &s;ubject. Under the year 875, it men|tions that Healfden, or Haldan, the Dani&s;h general, wa&s;ted the country between the Piks and <HI>Straecled-Walli,</HI> or Strat-Clyde Welch. And under 924, it mentions that the king of Scotland rever|enced Edward of England as his father; as did al&s;o the king of the <HI>Straecled-Welch.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. In the twelfth century, a whole blaze of evidence opens upon this &s;ubject, as hi&s;torians and other writers became then much more common in Britain. Florence of Worce&s;ter, who wrote about 1101, mentions the Strat-clyde Welch, in 875, as A&s;&s;er does. He al&s;o &s;ays, that in 901, Edward of England was acknowleged lord by the kings of the Scots, Cumbri, Strat-clyde Welch, and tho&s;e of the We&s;tern Britons, or Welch. Florence al&s;o mentions them, under 921,
<PB N="64" REF="149" MS="Y">on the &s;ame &s;core, as do mo&s;t hi&s;torians, who re|late the reign of Edward the Elder, which la&s;ted from 901 to 925.</P>
<P N="7">7. Simeon of Durham, who wrote about 1164, mentions the Strat-clyde Welch, under 875, as A&s;|&s;er; and under 921, he &s;ays that the king of Scots, with all his people, and Regnal, king of the Danes, with the Engli&s;h and Danes, living in Nor|thumberland, and al&s;o the king of the Strat-clyde. Welch, elected Edward king of England for their father and lord, and made a firm alliance with him.</P>
<P N="8">8. On the &s;helf of eccle&s;ia&s;tic ambition, we may place the Solemn Deed, intituled <HI>Inqui&s;itio facta per David Frincipem Cumbriae de po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ionibus Eccle&s;iae Gla&s;guen&s;is,</HI> publi&s;hed by Sir James Dal|rymple<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Collections concerning Scoti&s;h Hi&s;tory. Edin. 1705, 8vo</NOTE>. It was written about 1113, when David was prince of Cumberland, &amp;c. in the reign of his brother Alexander I. About that time a part of Cumberland was added to the &s;ee of Gla&s;gow, as we learn from the Anglia Sacra, p. 699. The zeal of David, afterward king of Scotland, for the church is well known; and to gratify it &s;eems to have been his greate&s;t pride. His zeal had here the &s;ame effect with that of our Scoti&s;h antiqui&s;ts, who, not having &s;en&s;e enough to know that it is much more honourable to en|crea&s;e, than retain, wi&s;h to per&s;uade us, that the kingdom of Scotland was always as large as now, on the &s;outh of the Forth and Clyde; &s;o, in this charter, becau&s;e lands are added to the &s;ee of Gla&s;gow, the&s;e new acqui&s;itions are mo&s;t fal&s;ely &s;aid to be an ancient part of it. One cannot help laughing to ob&s;erve, that fal&s;ehood is always but another name for folly: the truth, namely, that the &s;ee of Gla&s;gow had made new and great acqui|&s;itions did it high honour; the fal&s;ehood, namely, that the&s;e acqui&s;itions had formerly belonged to it, did it di&s;honour, not only as a fal&s;ehood,
<PB N="65" REF="150" MS="Y">but even taken as a truth, it gave an idea of weakne&s;s and uncertainty in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the &s;ee; and power re&s;ting wholly on opinion, nothing can injure it more than &s;uch an idea, whereas acqui&s;ition encrea&s;es the opinion of power to a degree far exceeding the reality. The <HI>regnum Cambren&s;e,</HI> or Welch kingdom in Scotland, is con|founded here with the <HI>regnum Cumbren&s;e,</HI> or king|dom of Cumbria. Ignorance indeed might al&s;o have it's &s;hare in this error; for there was but one letter of difference, and the di&s;tance between them did not exceed &s;ixty miles. Father Innes, as a good friend to the bi&s;hopric of Gla&s;gow, re&s;ts up|on this authority, that the kingdom of Strat-Clyde and that of Cumbria were all one, and reached from Cumberland to Gla&s;gow; but we have <HI>di&s;in|tere&s;ted</HI> authorities again&s;t this, as &s;hall pre&s;ently be &s;hewn; and tho I have a high opinion of the learned father, yet he de&s;erves blame for &s;acrificing any hi&s;toric point to a <HI>pious fraud.</HI> The next arti|cle al&s;o mu&s;t be partly con&s;idered in this light.</P>
<P N="9">9. For Jocelin, a monk of Furne&s;s, in Lan|ca&s;hire, wrote about 1180, and dedicated his life of St. Kentigern, or Mungo, to another Jocelin, bi&s;hop of Gla&s;gow, from 1174, till 1199<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">MS. Cotton. Vitell. c. viii. et tran&s;cript. penes Aut.</NOTE>. In that long work there are &s;everal anecdotes of the kingdom of Stratclyde. He calls it <HI>Regnum Cam|bren&s;e,</HI> or the Welch kingdom; and de&s;cribes it as reaching from the wall in Northumberland, to the firths of Forth and Clyde; an ab&s;urdity by his own account, for he mentions that St. Kenti|gern converted the Piks in Galloway. He makes the bi&s;hopric of Kentigern extend over all that king|dom; another ab&s;urdity, for if he had held &s;uch a bi&s;hopric, it could never have e&s;caped Beda, who does not mention him at all. Kentigern lived in the time of Saint Gregory the Pope, and or Columba, or about the year 600: and Jocelin
<PB N="66" REF="151">extends his life much, &s;o that he could not die be|fore 650. Now it is evident from Beda that there were no bi&s;hops at Gla&s;gow in that period, tho there were of Candida Ca&s;a, or Whithern: and that the Engli&s;h po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed mo&s;t of the &s;outh of Scotland, till driven out by the Piks in 684, or 46 years before Beda wrote, as he tells us, book IV. ch. 26. As the Engli&s;h held Lothian, and the &s;outh of Galloway, &s;o the Piks held the we&s;t by Jocelin's own account; and this <HI>Regnum Cambren&s;e</HI> mu&s;t be confined to Dunbarton and Renfrew &s;hires, and a &s;mall part of Lanerk&s;hire. In &s;hort, his book is palpably written to gratify the ambition of the bi&s;hop of Gla&s;gow; and Jocelin has &s;pared no <HI>pious fraud</HI> on the occa&s;ion. Yet even his er|rors throw light on the truth; and, if we withdraw our faith from the ambitious parts, we may give him con&s;iderable credit for the re&s;t, referring to hi&s;tory, or geography; e&s;pecially as, he &s;ays, he followed two elder lives, the one in Latin, the other in Iri&s;h. Of Kentigern's bi&s;hopric, we &s;hall &s;peak in Part VI. Jocelin puts Kentigern as cotemporary with two kings of Strat-Clyde, Morken and Rederech; and mentions his prophecy about Con&s;tantine, a third who &s;ucceeded Rederech: he al&s;o names Langueth the queen of Rederech.</P>
<P N="10">10. Ailred, abbot of Reval, in his life of St. Ninian, written about 1150, &s;peaking of the we&s;tern parts of Scotland, where St. Ninian was born, &s;ays, that it was certain, not only by the te&s;timony of hi&s;tories, but by the memory of men, that the&s;e we&s;tern countries had a proper king of their own till the end of the Saxon, or Engli&s;h times, that is, till the Norman inva&s;ion. And he mentions Tudwald as king in St Ninian's time, or about 412<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">MS. in Bibl. Bodl. Laud. F. XV. et tran&s;cript. penes Aut. See al&s;o Innes.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="11">11. Roger Hoveden wrote about 1210; and, under the years 899 and 917, he mentions the

Mo&s;t of the Engli&s;h writers, who relate the reign of Edward the elder, al&s;o mention them, &s;o their te&s;|timonies need not be repeated. Only it may be ob&s;erved, that Matthew of We&s;tmin&s;ter, called <HI>Florilegus,</HI> who wrote about 1320, always puts <HI>Galwalen&s;es</HI> for <HI>Stratcludwalli,</HI> knowing they lived in part of ancient Galloway, which extended even to Clyde.</P>
<P N="12">12. Caradoc of Llancarvon wrote his hi&s;tory of Wales about 1157. The editions we have of him are &s;tuffed with interpolations, e&s;pecially that of 1697. Little can therefore be re&s;ted on him. He tells us, under the year 878, that, after the death of Roderic the Great king of Wales, "the northern Britons of Strat-clwyd and Cumberland were mightily infe&s;ted, and weakened, thro the daily incur&s;ions of the Danes, Saxons, and Scots;" &s;o that many came to Gwyneth, under the conduct of one Hobert, and had all the country between Che&s;ter and the river Conway granted them for habitation, if they could expell the Saxons who had &s;eized it. Nece&s;&s;ity gave them courage, and they accompli&s;hed this. Under the years 944, and 1054, he mentions Stratclwyd <HI>in Wales.</HI></P>
<P>This la&s;t evidence naturally leads us to the chief difficulty in this point, namely, if the kingdom of Strat-Clyde was in Scotland, or Wales? For there is al&s;o a river Clyde in North Wales; and Cam|den and others incline to think the Strat-Clyde Welch were really of that country. I was long of the &s;ame opinion; but am now convinced it is erroneous, for the following rea&s;ons.</P>
<P N="1">1. In no hi&s;tory of Wales, however particular as to the other kingdoms, do we find Strat-Clyde mentioned as a kingdom in that country. Caradoc alone mentions it as a di&s;trict; and palpably infers that it received that name from the real Strat-Clyde Wel&s;h, who came into it, and expelled the Saxons
<PB N="68" REF="153">about 878, as above &s;tated. It may be &s;aid, neither are the Strat-Clyde Welch mentioned in Scoti&s;h hi&s;torians<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">They are however implied repeatedly by the name <HI>Britanni, Britones,</HI> in one of our olde&s;t fragments, the Chron. XII. Regum, apud Innes, as after &s;hewn.</NOTE> But this would be a quibble, for we have no Scoti&s;h hi&s;torians till the begining of the Fifteenth century; whereas the Welch had annals before Geofrey and Caradoc, who wrote in the Twelfth.</P>
<P N="2">2. Gwyneth, or North Wales, thro which the Welch Clyde runs, was of it&s;elf a very &s;mall kingdom; Powis, or Middle Wales, being ano|ther kingdom equal to it in &s;ize; and Demetia, OF South Wales, by far the large&s;t. So that it is im|probable that Strat-Clyde &s;hould be a kingdom in North Wales. And if it were, as we find kings of Dyfy and Cardigan in South Wales mentioned by Caradoc, it is mo&s;t improbable that the Welch writers &s;hould be &s;ilent about a people remarkable even in Engli&s;h hi&s;tory.</P>
<P N="3">3. The opinion of Camden was given from want of knowlege that there had been any Briti&s;h king|dom upon the Clyde in Scotland. Adomnan, Jocelin, Ailred, &amp;c. he had never &s;een, nor heard of. An eminent writer may be ignorant, but to found upon his ignorance is folly.</P>
<P N="4">4. Giraldus Cambren&s;is, who wrote his <HI>De&s;criptio Cambriae,</HI> and his <HI>Itinerarium Cambriae</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">See both at the end of the London 8vo edition of Ponticus Virunnius, an Italian writer, who abridged Geofrey of Mon|mouth, about the year 1500; and in Camden's Anglica, Hibernica, &amp;c. <HI>Francof.</HI> 1602. fol.</NOTE>, in the Twelfth century, is utterly &s;ilent concerning this kingdom, tho mo&s;t particular in every other matter. In the Itinerarium, written 1188, he mentions the river Cluyd toward, the end; but &s;ays not one word of this kingdom, nor of the Strat Clyde Welch.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Welch writers deny this kingdom to have been in Wales. Lluyd, in his <HI>Commentario|lum</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">This is the book &s;o warmly attacked by Buchanan. It was publi&s;hed at London, 1572; republi&s;hed by Williams, London 1731, 4to.</NOTE>
<PB N="69" REF="154">&s;ays expre&s;&s;ly that the Strat-Clyde Welch were on the Clyde in Scotland, whence a part of them came into Wales about 878, as above &s;tated. He indeed adds, that they founded a kingdom of Strat-Clyde in North Wales after that period. But in this he is po&s;itively contradicted by Williams his la&s;t learned editor, who &s;ays, that not a trace of this can be found in the Welch annals. They indeed &s;ay, <HI>Pan oedd oed Cri&s;t</HI> 944 <HI>y diffeithwyd Stratclud i gan y Sei&s;on,</HI> that is, '<HI>In the year of Chri&s;t</HI> 944, <HI>Stratclud was wa&s;ted by, the Saxons.</HI>' But this, proceeds Williams, mu&s;t be under&s;tood of the region near Dunclid, or Dunbarton, for it ap|pears from the Saxon Chronicle, that king Edmund in that year &s;ubdued all Northumberland; and that in the following years he wa&s;ted the land of the Cumbrians, &amp;c. In the &s;ame annals, adds he, we read <HI>Pan oedd oed Cri&s;t</HI> 971 <HI>y cyrchawdd Dung|wallawn Brenin Stratclud Rufain, ac y bit farw:</HI> that is, '<HI>In the year of Chri&s;t,</HI> 974, <HI>Dunwallon, king of Stratclud, went to Rome, and there died.</HI>' But that he was not of Wales, but of Scotland, appears, &s;ays Williams, from this, that there is no mention of him, nor his kingdom, in the Welch annals, and we call the vale of Clyde in North Wales not Strat-Clwyd, but Dyffryn Clwyd. He then adds, that the Stratclydwalli, of the Saxon Annals, &amp;c. were certainly on the Clyde in Scotland. At the end of this la&s;t edition of Llwyd, are <HI>Aerae Cambro-Britannicae,</HI> in which, under the year 584, we find that Gurgi and Pere|dur, &s;ons of a prince in North Britain were &s;lain. A note informs us, that at that time, and long after, the Britons, or Welch, held Dunclide, that is, Caer Alclud, now Dunbarton, and the neigh|bouring regions; and that the nobles of the&s;e
<PB N="70" REF="155" MS="Y">countries are called in old Welch MSS. <HI>Teyrnedd y Gogledd,</HI> or <HI>kings of the North,</HI> who, tho &s;everal, were all obedient to the king of Cumbria, or Cumberland.</P>
<P N="6">6. It will appear <HI>prima facie</HI> to an unprejudiced reader, that the Stratclyde Welch of A&s;&s;er, the Saxon Annals, and the other Engli&s;h hi&s;torians, above mentioned, were in Scotland, and not in Wales. For the progre&s;s of Halfden's army was north; while the other half of the Danes moved &s;outh, toward Cambridge<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Then called Grantebrycge, p. 27. edit. Wi&s;e.</NOTE>, as A&s;&s;er tells. Half|den wintered on the Tyne in Northumberland, and ravaged the lands of the Piks and Stratclyde Welch. Between him and North Wales were about 170 miles: between him and Clyde in Scot|land, not above 50. To &s;ay that Halfden ravaged the lands of North Wales, by excur&s;ions from Northumberland, would be a &s;trange information. But that he ravaged the &s;outh of Scotland, from that &s;tation, is quite natural. Florence, Simeon, &amp;c. always rank the Stratclyde Welch, with the Scots, Cumbrians, Northumbrians, all nations of the north. To rank the inhabitants of a &s;mall vale, in North Wales, with &s;uch nations, and &s;uch northerly nations, would have been ab&s;urd. Mat|thew of We&s;tmin&s;ter expre&s;&s;ly calls them Galwa|len&s;es, or people of Galloway, taken in the large &s;en&s;e it once bore.</P>
<P N="7">7. The kingdom on the Clyde in Scotland, mentioned by Adomnan, Jocelin, &amp;c. could not vani&s;h. We have certain evidence that there was a kingdom on the Clyde in Scotland; but none at all that there was one on the Clyde in Wales. The inference is obvious.</P>
<P N="8">8. The River Clyde in Scotland runs about 120 miles; that in Denbigh&s;hire, not above 20. The former is a great and maje&s;tic river; the later a &s;mall &s;tream. There is &s;omething ridiculous in
<PB N="71" REF="156" MS="Y">&s;uppo&s;ing that the inhabitants round a little river, in a &s;mall county of Wales, &s;hould find a place in Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, where the Welch are put <HI>in general,</HI> even the three real Welch kingdoms be|ing &s;eldom, or never, mentioned; while, in the particular hi&s;tory of Wales it&s;elf, the&s;e inhabitants never occur.</P>
<P>The&s;e arguments may, it is hoped, be found convincing; &s;o that it may be regarded as an Hi&s;toric Truth, that the Strat-Clyde Welch were upon the Clyde in Scotland; where in all events we know that a Welch kingdom long exi&s;ted, the kingdom of <HI>Petra Cloithe,</HI> of Adomnan, the <HI>regnum Cambren&s;e</HI> of Jocelin. The title is from the capi|tal, according to a not uncommon cu&s;tom of the darker ages. Thus in a MS. of the Cotton library, Nero, E. I. we find <HI>Didanus rex Oxenfordiae,</HI> for king of Mercia. In Caradoc of Lancarvon, un|der the year 933, we find king of London put for king of England; and the &s;ame expre&s;&s;ion is u&s;ed in the laws of Howel Dha. In Jocelin's life of Kentigern, mo&s;t of that &s;aint's adventures with the king Rederech happen at Gla&s;ghu, or Gla&s;|gow, anciently, as Jocelin &s;ays, called Cathures: and he al&s;o mentions, that king Rederech died the &s;ame year with Kentigern, <HI>in villa regia quae Pertmet nuncupatur,</HI> at the royal country hou&s;e called Pertmet.</P>
<P>Let us now proceed to con&s;ider a little the hi&s;tory of this kingdom, which is ob&s;cure in the extreme, and of which only &s;craps can be found. A Welch chronicle of Strat-Clyde would be a curious di&s;covery, but not to be hoped, &s;o we mu&s;t put up with the imperfect notices we have.</P>
<P>The Romans held Valentia down to the year 409, when they left Britain. Upon this derelict|ion they &s;eem to have appointed various princes<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Zozimus, lib. VI. mentions letters of Honorius <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, 'to the towns in Britain.' This was after the Romans left Britain; but princes &s;oon u&s;urped the power. The towns indeed, as founded by the Romans, might be con|&s;idered as more attached to them; which circum&s;tance may perhaps account for the&s;e letters being addre&s;&s;ed to the towns only.</NOTE>
<PB N="72" REF="157" MS="Y">over different parts of Britain; a plan &s;ugge&s;ted by &s;ound policy, for the&s;e petty kings would naturally be at variance; whereas, had one king been given, his power would have been &s;o great, that the Ro|mans would have found a return difficult, if they were &s;o inclined. This &s;uppo&s;ition is countenanced by Gildas, who addre&s;&s;es no le&s;s than five kings of the Britons in his time reigning at once over dif|ferent parts, which unhappily he does not &s;pecify. The kingdom now under view &s;eems originally to have extended over all Valentia; and Theodo|&s;ia, or Alclud, being the capital of the province, naturally impregnable, and towering, like the acropolis of Corinth, on the top of a high rock ri&s;ing at once from a plain, it became of cour&s;e the capital, and chief &s;trength of the new kingdom. But if ever this kingdom extended over Valentia, the duration of that extent mu&s;t have been very &s;hort indeed, for in 426 the Piks &s;eized on all the ea&s;t parts of Valentia, down to the wall of Gallio; and on all the &s;outh and we&s;t. About 450, Octa and Ebi&s;&s;a are &s;aid to have erected a Saxon &s;tate in Northumberland: and, however this be, the kingdom of Bernicia extended over the ea&s;t and &s;outh parts, while the Piks &s;eem to have retained pre&s;ent Air&s;hire. In &s;hort, Renfrew, Dunbarton, and a part of Lanerk &s;hire, &s;eem from the very fir&s;t to have con&s;tituted the kingdom of Strat-Clyde: a &s;mall portion of the upper part of Air-&s;hire mu&s;t al&s;o be added, where the iles of Great and Little Cumbra, in the mouth of the Clyde, retain the name of their old Cumraig po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, with the u&s;ual terminating <HI>a,</HI> of iles, which does not &s;ignify <HI>water,</HI> as fooli&s;hly imagined, but

However this be, the whole names in Cunningham and Kyle, are Gothic, and have in cour&s;e been ig|norantly called Saxon, by tho&s;e who know not that the Saxon is but a dialect of the Gothic; and that by the &s;ame rule the names in Norway, Den|mark, and Sweden, are all Saxon. It is certain that the Saxons never held this part of the country. If they had, we &s;hould have known much more of the kingdom of Stratclyde: but the ob&s;cure hints of Beda &s;ufficiently &s;hew, that the Saxon territory never &s;urrounded this kingdom on all quarters, &s;ave the north, as it mu&s;t have done, had the Saxons held Air-&s;hire. The kingdom of Bernicia, as appears from Beda, extended to the Forth on the ea&s;t, but by no means to the mouth of Clyde on the we&s;t. Whithern, he &s;ays, was in it; and &s;o was Abercorn; and it &s;eems to have con|tained only the &s;outh we&s;t of Galloway, tho it
<PB N="74" REF="159" MS="Y">held all he ea&s;t parts, from the Tweed to the Forth. But of this in the Supplement.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of Saint Ninian is very ob&s;cure. He as cotemporary with Saint Martin, as his life &s;hews, and all agree: that is, he vi&s;ited him on his return from Italy, and before he became bi&s;hop of Whithern. Saint Martin died, it is believed, in 412; and from the whole tenor of Ninian's &s;tory, it is apparent that he flouri&s;hed before the Piks &s;eized on the &s;outh parts, up to Gallio's wall, or the year 426. Tudwald therefore, the Briti&s;h king mentioned by Ailred, mu&s;t have been one of the princes tributary to the Romans; and has no connection with the kings of Strat-Clyde. Ailred indeed only calls him a king in the&s;e we&s;tern parts. That Whithern was the &s;ee erected by Ninian over the Piks he converted, is a childi&s;h and ridiculous error. Ailred tells that it was his proper Briti&s;h &s;ee, long before he went to convert the &s;outh Piks, who lived, as Beda &s;hews, &s;outh of the Grampian hills, or in Fife&s;hire, &amp;c. Ni|nian's &s;ucce&s;s among the&s;e Piks is pa&s;&s;ed in two lines lay Ailred, tho the mo&s;t important part of Ninian's life.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t, mention we find of kings of Strat-Clyde, is by Adomnan, who &s;upplies Roderc as above &s;hewn. This prince was clearly the Rederech of Jocelin, as Columba and Kentigern were cotempo|raries. His father teas Morken, as Jocelin &s;hews, and his &s;on Con&s;tantine: and we learn from Jocelin, that the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion vas lineal, as u&s;ual among the Welch. The Life of Gildas mentions Caunus, or Navus, in the fifth century, and his &s;ucce&s;&s;or Hoel.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Aerae Cumbro-britannicae,</HI> publi&s;hed in the la&s;t edition of Llwyd's <HI>Commentariolum,</HI> we find &s;ome notices concerning this kingdom, under the year 577, when the battle of Arderydd, or At|terith, on the E&s;k, near Solway firth, was fought. But the&s;e notices are &s;o confu&s;ed, as u&s;ual with all Celtic hi&s;tory, that nothing can ea&s;ily be made of
<PB N="75" REF="160">them. It is indeed &s;urprizing that almo&s;t every in|telligence conveyed in the Celtic dialects, Welch or Iri&s;h, amounts, from its confu&s;ion and inaccu|racy, to wor&s;e than no intelligence at all; while the Northern hi&s;tories, written in Gothic, are ever clear and accurate. A &s;trong proof among many, that a Celtic mind is very different from a Gothic one. <HI>Homo homini deus</HI> It is there &s;tated from &s;ome imperfect hints of Welch genealogies, &amp;c. that this battle was fought between Roderic, king of Cumbria, on the one &s;ide, and Guendo|lau and Aedan, northern princes, on the other. Roderic was not king of Cumbria, but of Strat-Clyde, as appears from Williams's own account; for he &s;ays, he is the &s;ame mentioned in the life of Kentigern. So far as i can under&s;tand the matter, it was an inte&s;tine war; and is therefore ranged by the Welch author of the <HI>Triades</HI> among the three fooli&s;h battles, or tho&s;e fought for nothing. Nei|ther of the two adver&s;aries of Roderic, namely Guendolau and Aedan, are once mentioned as kings. Guendolau, who fell in this battle, was the patron of Merlin of Calydon, who lived in Strat-Clyde, and conver&s;ed with Kentigern, as will be &s;een in Part VI. He and Aedan &s;eem to have rebelled, and got a&s;&s;i&s;tance from Wales, which they were leading again&s;t Roderic, when met by him, and defeated. The genealogy of Roderic there given, is <HI>Rhydderch Hael ab Tudwal Tudglud, ab Cedig, ab Dyfuwal Hen, ab Ednyfed, ab Mac&s;en Wledig:</HI> and both Guendolau and Aedan are in a like manner traced to Mac&s;in, or Maxi|mus Tyrannus, which Williams, in&s;tead of laugh|ing at, takes <HI>bona fide!</HI> But Welch and Iri&s;h genealogies are only documents for bedlamites, being the quinte&s;&s;ence of frenzy and folly. We however learn, that Roderic was a monarch &s;o generous, that he was called <HI>Hael,</HI> or The <HI>Bountiful,</HI> and is prai&s;ed by different Welch authors. No|thing can be more ludicrous than the remark of
<PB N="76" REF="161">Williams upon the &s;imilarity between Aidan and Aedan, that the Scoti&s;h writers had &s;tolen &s;ome actions of Welch princes. We have the authority of Beda, a page of whom is worth all the Welch and Iri&s;h annals in the world, for Aidan <HI>rex Sco|torum qui Britanniam inhabitant;</HI> for the Welch no|bleman Aedan, we have no authority at all. The Kintillus, or Kinatellus, &s;on of Gauran, is a mere dream: and he is bani&s;hed from Scoti&s;h hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Thus we can trace five kings of Strat-Clyde: from the life of Gildas, two who reigned toward the end of the fifth, and beginning of the &s;ixth century, CAUNUS and HOEL: from Adomnan, one who reigned toward the end of the &s;ixth century, Roderc: two from Jocelin, MORKEN predece&s;&s;or of RODERC, and CONSTANTINE &s;on of Roderc. They who wi&s;h to &s;ee uncertain hints of the fir&s;t Caunus, are referred to U&s;her's Antiquities of the Briti&s;h Churches; who al&s;o informs us, from Welch authors, that Hoel, the next, was &s;lain in battle by Arthur<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">The reader need hardly be told that Arthur was merely a name given by the Welch to Aurelius Ambro&s;ius, their Ro|man defender again&s;t the Saxons. Sec Gildas, c. 25. Beda l. 16. <HI>Art-uir,</HI> &s;ignifies the Chief, or Great Man. He flouri&s;hed about the year 480. Gildas lived in the very time a&s;&s;igned to the mock Arthur, yet knew nothing of him; nor did Beda. Nay, nor Nennius; for the chapter concerning Arthur, is an addition, and occurs after the words <HI>Hic expli|ciunt ge&s;ta B$itonum a Nennio con&s;cripta.</HI> See Bertram's edition. Mr. Whitaker, to &s;upport his romance of Morte Arthur, which, with him, is hi&s;tory, makes Nennius live in 620, tho, from no lets than five computations in his work, it he evident that he wrote in 858: and any man, the lea&s;t ver&s;ed in &s;uch matters, mu&s;t &s;ee from his work in general that it is of the Ninth century. Nor did Mr. W. ob&s;erve that the chapter on Arthur is not of Nennius, but an addition taken from Geo|frey's romance. The author, fond of Arthur's fame, once thought him a reality; but upon full examination is unde|ceived. Milton declares again&s;t the exi&s;tence of Arthur. Hume, following, as u&s;ual, What Mr. Gibbon ju&s;tly calls, 'the gro&s;s ignorance of Carte,' &s;upports the dream. That Arthur was Aurelius Ambro&s;ius is certain: but the Arthur of Welch hi&s;tory is a non-exi&s;tence. The names of places built on by Mr. Whitaker, aro&s;e merely from the romances; and none of them are older than the 13th and 14th centuries. Arthur's Seat near Edinburgh is a name of ye&s;terday, and aro&s;e from the tournaments near it; as did Arthur's Round Table at Stirling. In the centuries of chivalry and romance, Arthur was quite popular, and gave occa&s;ion to many names of places.</NOTE>. Morken and Con&s;tantine, are mentioned
<PB N="77" REF="162" MS="Y">by Jocelin. Roderc is celebrated by different writers; and was the greate&s;t of the kings of Strat-Clyde.</P>
<P>The Annals of Ul&s;ter, the mo&s;t valuable and authentic of the Iri&s;h Hi&s;tories, and generally founded on tho&s;e of Tighernac, who wrote in 1088, give us the following kings of Alclyde, or Strat|clyde. In 657, &s;ay 660, as the&s;e annals generally precede the common calculations of the Chri&s;tian aera by three years, GUIRET king of Alclyde died. He was probably &s;ucce&s;&s;or of the above Con&s;tan|tin. In 693 [696], DONAL, &s;on of Owen, king of Alclyde, died. In 710 [713], there was a bat|tle between the Dalriads, or Iri&s;h of Argyle, and the Britons, [of Stratclyde,] in which the later were vanqui&s;hed. In 716 [719], there was ano|ther battle at the &s;tone, called Mimro, and the Britons again fled. In 721 [724], BILE, &s;on of Eilphin, king of Alclyde, died.</P>
<P>After this we find nothing concerning this king|dom till the year 726, when Egbert, king of Nor|thumberland, and Unnu&s;t, king of the Piks led their army to Alcluid, and the Britons yielding, received terms. So Simeon of Durham; and Roger Hoveden<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Anno 756, Eadbert rex, decimo quinto anno regni &s;ui, et Unnu&s;t rex Pictorum, duxerunt exercitum ad Urbem Al|cluit; ibique Britones inde conditionem receperunt prima die men&s;is Augu&s;ti. <HI>Hov$den, et &s;ic etiam Sim.

<P>In 779 [782] Alcluid was burnt in the Calends, or 1&s;t of January, but by whom appears not. In 869 [872,] Alclyde was be&s;ieged by the Norwegians
<PB N="78" REF="163" MS="Y">and Danes from Ireland, under Olave and Ivar, who, after be&s;etting it for four months, at length de&s;troyed it. In 871 [874,] ARTGA, king of the.

<P>In 875 we find Halfden wa&s;ting the territories of the Strat-clud Welch, and Piks. About this time, if we believe Welch writers, a part of the Strat-clud Welch and Cumbrians &s;ettled in Wales.</P>
<P>In the reign of Edward the Elder, of England, (900&mdash;925) we find the Stratclud Welch expre&s;s affection and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to him, if Engli&s;h writers be believed.</P>
<P>About 972 we learn from Caradoc of Lancar|von, that Dunwallon, king of Strat-Clyde, went to Rome. Llwyd informs us, he was the la&s;t king of Strat-Clyde, and that he died at Rome &s;oon after.</P>
<P>The nature of the termination of this kingdom &s;eems unknown. In 970, Kenneth IV. became king of the Piks, and reigned till 992. It is mo&s;t remarkable, that in the ancient Chronicle of the Twelve kings, who reigned after the union of the Piks and Dalriads, we find that this very Kenneth <HI>praedavit Britanniam,</HI> and after, <HI>praedavit Saxoniam.</HI> The <HI>Britontes</HI> and <HI>Britannia</HI> of the whole of that Chronicle appear unque&s;tionably the Strat-Clyde Welch, or Britons, and their country. It informs us that Eochoid, the fifth of the&s;e kings, 883, was <HI>filius Ku regis Britannorum,</HI> 'the &s;on of Ku king of the Britons.' That in the time of Con&s;tantine, the &s;eventh of the&s;e princes, 904, Dovenald, king of the Britons, died, and was &s;ucceeded by Dove|nald &s;on of Ed. We al&s;o find here that Culen 965, and his brother Eochoid, were &s;lain by the&s;e Bri|tons; which is confirmed by the Annals of Ul&s;ter.</P>

<P>In 945, according to the Engli&s;h hi&s;torians<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Chron. Saxon. &amp;c.</NOTE> Edmund king of England gave Cumberland to Malcom I. of Scotland, on condition of homage. The Piks were an po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Lothian and Gal|loway, from the year 426. In the reign of Indulf, about 956, we find that the town of Eden was given up to the Scots by the Engli&s;h<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Chron. apud Innes.</NOTE>; but, if, this were Edinburgh, it does by no means follow that the Engli&s;h then held Lothian, for the text bears only that town, which would be ab&s;urd, had the large territory around it been al&s;o given up. The fact &s;eems, that Athel&s;tan, when he ravaged the &s;outh of Scotland in 934, had left a garri&s;on here, in like manner as later kings held forts in the &s;outh, nay north of Scotland, when they had not the &s;malle&s;t territory around them. This garri&s;on departed in Indulf's time, and the town was of cour&s;e given up to the Scots. When Cumberland was given up to Malcom in 945, there is every rea&s;on to think that the Scoti&s;h dominions reached down to Solway in the middle, and to the Tweed in the ea&s;t. But the &s;outh-we&s;t part of Scotland, or that between the rivers Clyde and Nith and the we&s;tern &s;ea, &s;eems from it's angular &s;ituation to have long maintained a &s;pecies of independency. It is well known that, even down to the twelfth century, the lords of Galloway were only feudatory to the Scoti&s;h kings<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Sir David Dalrymple's Annals.</NOTE>; and were in fact petty &s;overeigns. Down to the tenth century, or about 970, the kings of Strat-Clyde were apparently in like predicament; and the Forth was regarded as the boundary between them and the Piks on the North ea&s;t, as it originates near Loch Lomond in Dunbarton&s;hire; as Loch Long, and the mouth of Clyde, divided them from the Dalriads on the north and we&s;t.

The kingdom of Strat-Clyde certainly remained in exi&s;tence for about thirty years after Cumberland was given up to the Piki&s;h kings. Before this event we find the Piks and Strat-Clyde Britons in clo&s;e alliance; &s;o that Eochoid, the &s;on of a king of Strat-Clyde, came to the Piki&s;h throne by inheritance in 883, as above mentioned, tho Grig, who was only regent, has u&s;urped his place, and held it exclu&s;ively among the Scoti&s;h fabuli&s;ts, who chri&s;ten him Gregory the Great, and &s;ay he was a big con|queror, and all that. But when Cumberland was re&s;igned to Malcom I. in 945, on account of the turbulence of it's Welch inhabitants, as Matthew of We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;ays, the Piks became of cour&s;e the enemies of the Britons, who regarded them as new tyrants. This enmity extended to Stratclyde, be|tween which and Cumbria there was con&s;tant inter|cour&s;e; &s;o that before 970, as appears from the above quoted old Chronicle, wars had ari&s;en, and in that year Culen was &s;lain by the&s;e Britons.</P>
<P>About 972, it appears that Kenneth IV. entirely &s;ubdued the&s;e Britons of Strat-Clyde: and their territory being annexed to the Piki&s;h throne, we find no mention of the kingdom of Strat-Clyde afterward. But the people occur in charters, &amp;c. to a late period. Innes &s;hews that charters to the &s;ee of Gla&s;gow, by Malcom IV. and William, are addre&s;&s;ed, <HI>Francis, et Anglicis, Scotis et Galweien|&s;ibus, et Walen&s;ibus, et omnibus eccle&s;iae S.

<P>Dunbarton&s;hire, Renfrew&s;hire, and great part of Lanerk&s;hire, formed the kingdom of Strat-Clyde, being about eighty miles long, and thirty broad; and equal in &s;ize to the kingdom of Kent, or &s;ome others of the heptarchy, and &s;uperior to mo&s;t of the other Welch kingdoms. The language of this part of Scotland &s;till retains &s;omething of the Welch accent, and &s;ome peculiar words; tho the Piki&s;h, or broad Scoti&s;h, the language of the &s;outh of Scotland all around this part, has &s;up|planted the old &s;peech entirely. It is al&s;o be|lieved that the people were very much le&s;&s;ened before they were &s;ubdued; for their defence, as may be judged from the old Chronicle above quoted, was ob&s;tinate and bloody, and co&s;t Culen, one of the kings of Scotland (then Pikland), his life; and Kenneth IV. in who&s;e reign their la&s;t king is placed and their name vani&s;hes, a great part of his infantry. Dunwallon, their king, &s;eems to have fled to Wales, whence he went to Rome; and it is likely that many of his &s;ubjects al&s;o e&s;caped into Wales. The &s;peech of Galloway has in general a good deal of the Welch accent, which is vulgarly thought the Iri&s;h, for the Celtic accents
<PB N="82" REF="169" MS="Y">are much the &s;ame. In Carrick till lately Iri&s;h was &s;poken; but this is an exception, owing to that part being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Wild Scots of Galloway, an Iri&s;h &s;ettlement, as above men|tioned.</P>
<P>It may perhaps be matter of wonder that this kingdom of Strat-Clyde &s;hould exi&s;t &s;o long in the mid&s;t of enemies. But this wonder will cea&s;e, when we con&s;ider:

<ITEM>2. That when the Dalriads, in 503, &s;ettled in Argyle, they became next neighbours to tho&s;e Britons; and they &s;eem to have naturally formed alliance from proximity of &s;peech; both &s;peaking the Celtic, tho in different dialects; and to have protected each other.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That the Piks were, to a late period, too much harra&s;&s;ed by the Angli, to think of attempting this conque&s;t, and would naturally rather wi&s;h to have the Strat-Clyde Britons in their amity, as a barrier again&s;t the Angli.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. That when the Angli were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Ber|nicia, which was but for a &s;hort and tumultuary time, they were not only harra&s;&s;ed by the Piks and old Scots, but by their &s;outhern brethren; &s;o that it would have been folly in them to have attacked the Strat-Clyde Welch, and thus have converted into an enemy a people who&s;e whole view &s;eems to have been &s;elf-defence.</ITEM>

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER VI.</HI> The kingdom of Cumbria.</HEAD>
<P>THIS kingdom was not within the bounds of this Part of my work, being &s;outh of Sol|way firth; but &s;ome wrongly extending it further north, and it being at any rate a kingdom of the Southern Britons, once belonging to Scotland, it &s;hall be con&s;idered here. As this kingdom has by Innes, and others, been confounded with that of Strat-Clyde, it becomes nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hew that it was quite a different &s;tate, before entering upon any other di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this &s;ubject. Innes has taken the matter for granted, and gives no rea&s;ons for his opinion; but they, who would &s;hew Cum|bria and Strat-Clyde to have been one and the &s;ame kingdom, might argue thus.</P>
<P N="1">1. Beda mentions that Alclud was in the hands of the Britons in his time, or 731; but &s;ays no|thing of any po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions they had in pre&s;ent Cum|berland, tho he lived in Northumberland; and, if they had &s;uch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, they could not have e&s;caped his knowledge.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Inqui&s;itio facta per David Principem Cum|briae, de Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ionibus Eccle&s;iae Gla&s;guen&s;is,</HI> a deed of the year 1113, expre&s;&s;ly puts Gla&s;gow as the ancient metropolitan &s;ee of Cumbria: and, by it's uniform tenor, &s;hews that the framer of it looked on Cumbria as including the intervening country between Cumberland and Gla&s;gow. That is, if we judge from this deed, Cumbria and Strat-Clyde were certainly all one.</P>
<PB N="84" REF="171">
<P N="3">3. Geofrey of Monmouth, who wrote about 1150, is of the &s;ame opinion; for in his Life of Merlin o Caledon, a MS. in the Cotton Library, Ve&s;p. E. IV. he puts Roderch, the celebrated king of Strat-Clyde, as king of the Cumbri; and calls his kingdom Cumbria, tho his city he names Alclud<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Geofrey al&s;o in his Romance, which proved &s;o ruinous to Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, confounds Alclyde, or Dunbarton, with Car|lile. Roger of Che&s;ter, author of the Polychronicon, written about 1330, and a&s;cribed to Ralph Higden, was confounded with this blunder of that ignorant fabuli&s;t, and doubts where to place Alclyde. Goodal hence wi&s;ely infers, that Alclyde was Carlile, and it's kingdom Cumberland! Alclyde, or Dunbarton, was de&s;troyed by the Danes from Ireland in 872, as above &s;hewn. About 875, the Danes who ravaged Nor|thumberland de&s;troyed Carlile. Geofrey of Monmouth is the <HI>only</HI> writer who confounds Alclyde with Carlile. Roger of Che&s;ter, a late writer of no authority, is puzzled with his error; and by mi&s;taking the Wall of Antoninus, implied by Beda, for that of Gallio. But again&s;t the&s;e writers are Beda, Adomnan, Jocelin, who place Alclyde on the Clyde in Scot|land; and ALL the old Engli&s;h hi&s;torians, who call Carlile Luguballia and Carlele, but never Alclyde. Simeon of Dur|ham at 756 calls Dunbarton <HI>Alcluith;</HI> at 1092 he terms Car|lile <HI>Luguballia, anglice Carlele.</HI> Fordun, II. 29, &s;pecially di&s;tingui&s;hes Carlile from Alclyde, &s;aying, 'Kaerleile etiam, et Alneclud, five Alclide, quae et nunc Dunbretan nuncu|patur, oppidaque plurima,' &amp;c. In Welch, Carlile is called Caer Liwelydd, Evans, p. 36, which bearing &s;ome &s;imila|rity to Caer Alclydd, might occa&s;ion Geofrey's mi&s;take; but he him&s;elf, lib. VII. puts Alclud in Scotland, and has a curious de&s;cription of Lake Limogoum, or Loch Lomond, which he places in Mureith, or Moray!</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="4">4. That the Cumbri were not of pre&s;ent Cum|berland might appear from Richard of Hexham, who &s;ays that when David king of Scotland en|tered the territory of St. Cuthbert, in 1138, he there waited for his army. 'And without delay, according to his orders, the Piks, and Cumbri, and men of Carlel and &s;urrounding country, came to him<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Nec mora ex ejus edicto Picti, et Cumbri, et homines de Carlel et de circumjacente regione, ad illum convenerunt. Ricard. Hagu&s;tald. de Ge&s;t. Steph. Col. 319, in Scriptor. X.</NOTE>.' Had the Cumbri been of Cumberland, they mu&s;t have been the men of Carlile, and it's
<PB N="85" REF="172">&s;urrounding country; &s;o that a di&s;tinction between the Cumbri and the people of Cumberland &s;eems unavoidable. And if the Cumbri were not of Cumberland, they mu&s;t have been of Strat-Clyde, as will be allowed by all.</P>
<P>The&s;e arguments are all that i can find which may &s;erve this opinion; and they are &s;tated with the utmo&s;t candour, as i neither wi&s;h to mi&s;lead, nor be mi&s;led. Indeed they were at fir&s;t &s;o pre|valent with me, that i long thought Strat-Clyde and Cumbria all one; but was forced to abandon this opinion for rea&s;ons which &s;hall be produced, after giving an&s;wers to the above arguments on the other &s;ide.</P>
<P N="1">1. Beda's &s;ilence as to the Cumbri and Cumbria is at be&s;t but a negative argument, and of cour&s;e a nullity. His work is intitled <HI>The Eccle&s;ia&s;tic hi&s;tory of the Engli&s;h nation:</HI> &s;ecular affairs he very &s;eldom, and very briefly, mentions. He &s;ays not one word of the Britons in Wales, and Cornwall; &s;o that his &s;ilence as to tho&s;e in Cum|bria need not be wondered at.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Inqui&s;itio</HI> is an eccle&s;ia&s;tic fraud, to &s;erve the purpo&s;es of an avaricious and ambitious &s;ee, not a di&s;intere&s;ted charter, which can &s;erve hi&s;tory.</P>
<P N="3">3. Geofrey is a romancer, not an hi&s;torian. He has u&s;ed &s;uch freedoms with the hi&s;tory of his own country around him, that, in &s;uch di&s;tant re|gions as Cumbria and Strat-Clyde, his veracity is at be&s;t mo&s;t &s;u&s;picious. It might al&s;o very naturally happen that many of the Welch writers, from the remotene&s;s of Strat-Clyde and Cumbria, and ob&s;curity of their hi&s;tory, might confound the&s;e two regions into one, or mi&s;take the one for the other.</P>
<P N="4">4. The fourth argument is to me the &s;tronge&s;t. Richard lived at Hexham in Northumberland, near the &s;pot, and al&s;o near the time, or about 1150. He is the only writer in being, who &s;eems to di&s;tingui&s;h the Cumbri from the people of Cum|berland.
<PB N="86" REF="173">Carlele is infallibly Carlile: but how came a people in that city and the &s;urrounding territory different from the Cumbri, who by every hypothe&s;is held Cumberland? The fol|lowing &s;eems the only way of accounting for this. About the year 875 the Danes under dif|ferent leaders ravaged all the north of England with great fury; and, as we learn from many hi&s;torians, razed Carlile to the ground. The &s;ame writers mention that in 1092 it was re|built by William II. after lying de&s;ert for two centuries. It was to revenge this erection of a fortified town in the mid&s;t of his feudal dominions, that Malcom III. invaded England in 1093, when he was &s;lain. In 1100, Henry I. of Eng|land married Matilda, &s;i&s;ter of Edgar the Scoti&s;h king; upon which event amity followed between the kingdoms till 1137, when David I. oppo&s;ed Stephen of England. During this &s;pace it appears, from the hi&s;torians of the War of the Standard, 1138, that Carlile and Cumberland, nay Nor|thumberland, had been regarded as part of the Scoti&s;h dominions. So that it would &s;eem that Henry I. upon his marriage had in particular re|&s;igned Carlile to Edgar: for no formal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion had been ever taken by the Engli&s;h of any other part of the&s;e domains; and it appears from the Doom&s;day Book, that they were not regarded as part of England. The rebuilding and fortifying of Carlile, by William II. was an unexampled en|croachment, but, from the &s;udden boldne&s;s in erecting a &s;trong town in the heart of an enemy's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, was a &s;troke of daring policy, worthy of an impetuous and haughty monarch; and, con|&s;idered either by it's depth or re&s;olution commands admiration<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">But it is to be con&s;idered, whether, as Lord Paramount of Cumberland, as he certainly was, the king of Scotland pay|ing homage for it, he had not a title to build a fortified city to protect his own territory? This que&s;tion is &s;ubmitted to tho&s;e ver&s;ed in feudal laws and cu&s;toms. It mu&s;t al&s;o be ob&s;erved, that William the Conqueror, quarelling with Malcom III. gave Cumberland to Ranulph de Me&s;chines. See Mona&s;t. Angl. I. 400.</NOTE>. But when William II. rebuilt Car|lile,
<PB N="87" REF="174" MS="Y">in 1092, it cannot be dreamed that he repeopled it with Welchmen, or Cumbri. Engli&s;h or Nor|mans mu&s;t have been the new tenants, and mo&s;t probably the later. When, about 1100, Carlile was given up to the Scoti&s;h, we cannot believe that the Engli&s;h garri&s;on was allowed to remain, for this were without all example. Edgar king of Scotland certainly &s;ent a garri&s;on into it, of his own &s;ubjects, and not of the Dalriads, or Old Scotti, of Britain, for they were de&s;pi&s;ed by our kings; and being mere Celtic &s;avages, ignorant of all arts, could know nothing of engines, or aught belonging to fortifications, or defence of them. We may therefore conclude that this new garri&s;on was of Piks from the &s;outh of Scotland, either <HI>Gal|weien&s;es,</HI> or <HI>Tevedalen&s;es,</HI> or <HI>Lothianen&s;es,</HI> or a mixture. Thus the rea&s;on appears why the peo|ple of Carlile, and the &s;urrounding territory were not Cumbri, tho the Cumbri were que&s;tionle&s;s the people of Cumberland.</P>
<P>Having thus, it is hoped, &s;atisfactorily an|&s;wered the&s;e arguments for Strat-Clyde and Cum|bria being all one, let us proceed to po&s;itive proofs of their difference.</P>
<P N="1">1. Florence of Worce&s;ter, one of the mo&s;t ancient and authentic of Engli&s;h &s;ecular hi&s;torians, and who wrote about 1100, &s;pecially di&s;tingui&s;hes between the Cumbri and Stratcludwalli, &s;aying under the year 901, p. 598, ed. Francof. 1601. fol. that Edward the Elder <HI>'Scotorum, Cumbrorum, Streatgledwa|lorum, omne&s;que Occidentalium Britonum reges in deditionem accepit.'</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Roger Hoveden, who wrote about the year 1205, has the &s;ame di&s;tinction; &s;aying, under the year 900, that Edward the Elder <HI>Scottorum, Cum|brorum,
<PB N="88" REF="175">Stereglendwalorum, omne&s;que Occidentalium Brittonum reges in deditionem accepit:</HI> 'received &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion from the kings of the Scots, Cumbri, Strat-Clyde Welch; and all the kings of the we&s;tern Britons,' (now Welch proper).</P>
<P N="3">3. Caradoc of Lancarvon, the mo&s;t authentic of the Welch writers, and who wrote about 1150, &s;ays, as above &s;tated, 'the northern Britons of Strat-Clyde, AND Cumberland:' thus clearly di&s;|tingui&s;hing between the&s;e countries.</P>
<P N="4">4. In 945, as Engli&s;h hi&s;torians &s;ay, Edmund king of England gave Cumberland to Malcom I. of Scotland, on condition of homage. Some of the Engli&s;h hi&s;torians called the territory given, <HI>Cumberland,</HI> as the Saxon Chronicle, William of Malm&s;bury, Henry of Huntingdon: others call it <HI>terram Cumbrorum,</HI> 'the land of the Cumbri,' as Florence of Worce&s;ter, Roger Hoveden, and Simeon of Durham. This is a plain proof that the Cumbri held no country, &s;ave Cumberland.</P>
<P N="5">5. In 945 Cumberland was re&s;igned to Malcom I. and it was generally ruled by the intended &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or to the Scoti&s;h (then Piki&s;h) throne. But &s;o late as 972 we find Dunwallon, a Welch prince, &s;overeign of Strat-Clyde, as Caradoc above cited &s;hews. In the time of Edgar of England (959 to 975), a Malcom was king of the Cumbri, as appears from William of Malm&s;bury, Simeon of Durham, Florence of Worce&s;ter: and at that very time Dunwallon was king of Strat-Clyde. This &s;urely proves a difference between Cumbria and Strat-Clyde. Perhaps it may be &s;aid, that Dunwallon was the titular Welch king, while Malcom really held the territory; but it is believed that the idea of a titular king was not then known, and that when a family had lo&s;t a throne for about thirty years, as would be, in this &s;uppo&s;ition, the ca&s;e with Cumbria, if the &s;ame with Strat-Clyde, the title was lo&s;t with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<PB N="89" REF="176">
<P N="6">6. Had Cumbria extended from Cumberland to Dunbarton, the whole we&s;tern part of the &s;outh of Scotland mu&s;t have formed one continued Welch kingdom; nor could the Piks have held Galloway, as it appears from Jocelin<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Vita Kentegerni.</NOTE> they did even in the &s;ixth century; and, from old chroni|cles<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Reg. St. And. apud Innes: and &s;ee Part V.</NOTE> they did in the ninth, when Kenneth ac|ceded to the Piki&s;h throne; as from Engli&s;h wri|ters they did in the twelfth, at the time of the War of the Standard. The Piks mu&s;t in this ca&s;e have been in the heart of this Welch kingdom, and have divided it into two great parts; a matter un|exampled and unconceivable.</P>
<P N="7">7. Had Cumbria been of &s;uch extent it mu&s;t have been a kingdom 140 miles long, and in many places 60 broad; while all Wales is not above 120 miles long, and 60 broad. The power and force of this kingdom mu&s;t there|fore have been &s;uperior to tho&s;e of all Wales united. Let the reader but cooly reflect on the con&s;equences of this &s;uppo&s;ition. If Wales, tho &s;plit into three divi&s;ions, made &s;uch a figure in hi&s;tory, what mu&s;t Cumbria have done? Could &s;o great a kingdom almo&s;t e&s;cape the notice of hi&s;torians? While Wales produced &s;o many writers, how could Cumbria produce but one or two? Could &s;uch a kingdom, bordering on the Iri&s;h &s;ea, e&s;cape the notice of the Iri&s;h writers, who yet mark &s;o much concerning Pikland, and the petty kingdom of Dalriada? Could &s;o large a &s;tate e&s;cape Beda, who narrates &s;o many events that befell in and about it? All the&s;e, and many other views, in which this &s;uppo&s;ition may be placed, hold it out in &s;o ab&s;urd a light, that every rea&s;onable man will at once reject it. Whereas if we grant Strat-Clyde and Cumbria to have been two petty Welch kingdoms, at a di&s;tance from each other, all this ab&s;urdity vani&s;hes. Nor
<PB N="90" REF="177">can i &s;ee how Innes could &s;incerely imagine that Cumbria was of &s;uch va&s;t extent as the <HI>Inqui&s;itio</HI> marks: and it is uncertain, whether pity or anger be due to him, who, for the &s;ake of a <HI>pious fraud,</HI> gave up a grand point in the hi&s;tory of his country to his love for the old &s;ee of Gla&s;gow, and the Roman faith.</P>
<P N="8">8. The names them&s;elves are here of the greate&s;t weight. Adomnan's king of Petra Cloithe, or the rock of Clyde, or Alclyde, as <HI>Al</HI> in Welch means a rock, is &s;o nearly allied by name to Strat-Clyde, that it were mo&s;t rea&s;onable, from this alone, to infer them one and the &s;ame; e&s;pecially &s;eeing that it is unque&s;tionably Dunbarton on the Clyde in Scotland which is meant by Adomnan, and that Strat-Clyde is mentioned as near the Piks, &s;o that it mu&s;t al&s;o have been on the Clyde in Scotland, as above &s;hewn. In like manner Cumbria, from the fir&s;t mention of it to the la&s;t, is by authentic Engli&s;h writers u&s;ed &s;olely for Cumberland; and 'the land of the Cumbri,' and 'Cumberland,' are u&s;ed alternately, as al&s;o above noted. Not one hint can be brought from any writer, that the meaning of the words Cumbri and Cumbria was &s;o abridged, as to pa&s;s at fir&s;t for all the &s;outhwe&s;t of Scotland, and afterward be confined to a county of England.</P>
<P>From the&s;e arguments it is believed that Cum|bria will, in &s;pite of the ambition of the &s;ee of Gla&s;gow, be for ever re&s;tored to it's true circum|&s;cription of Cumberland in England: and we are happily no longer in fear that &s;ome future venal &s;cribe &s;hould change an <HI>a</HI> into an <HI>u;</HI> and for <HI>reg|num Cambren&s;e,</HI> read <HI>regnum Cumbren&s;e.</HI> Jocelin always u&s;es the former for the kingdom of Strat-Clyde: and tho he extends it over all the &s;outh of Scotland, ea&s;t and we&s;t, yet he does not include Cumberland in it, as he makes it terminate at the

It's Northern boundaries were certainly not more extended than tho&s;e of pre&s;ent Cumberland, being chiefly the river E&s;k, which runs into Sol|way firth; but it is more likely that the wall of Gallio, the <HI>Piks Wall,</HI> was the northern frontier, as we find in Beda that the Piks in 426 &s;eized the country up to that wall. The We&s;t boundary is the &s;ea. The Ea&s;t the river of South Tyne, which parts it from Northumberland. The South boun|dary is more difficult to adju&s;t; but it is generally &s;uppo&s;ed that We&s;tmoreland, and a &s;mall part of Lanca&s;hire, were included in ancient Cumbria: and this &s;eems confirmed by the Doom&s;day book, which omits Cumberland, We&s;tmoreland, and a &s;mall part of Lanca&s;hire, as not belonging to England. Northumberland is al&s;o omitted in the Doom&s;day book, having Dani&s;h independent princes, till 953, when Earls nearly as indepen|dent followed; as may be &s;een in Hoveden, and others. The&s;e Earls continued till the time of William II. who took Northumberland into his own hands, as did Henry I. as appears from Hoveden, and from a li&s;t of the&s;e Earls of the 12th or 13th age, in the Cotton library, Domit. D. VIII. given in the Appendix.</P>
<P>The Britons, who retired to the mountains of the we&s;tern coa&s;t, were little noticed or regarded by the Saxon invaders, who were content with the plenty of the ea&s;tern plains. Hence little or no information can be derived concerning even Wales, the greate&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e Britons,
<PB N="92" REF="179">from the Saxon authors. No wonder then that the Strat-Clyde Welch, and the Cumbri, almo&s;t e&s;caped their notice. The divi&s;ion of England into petty kingdoms, which in fact la&s;ted till 959, when Edwy king of the We&s;t Saxons dying, Edgar became fir&s;t king of all England, al&s;o contributed to our want of infor|mation, by occa&s;ioning &s;uch confu&s;ion, that even the Saxon hi&s;tory is ob&s;cure. In con&s;tant di&s;&s;en|tions among them&s;elves, they had other employ|ment than to attend to the &s;ituation or affairs of their neighbours.

<P>That venerable writer is &s;o occupied with miracles, that he hardly deigns to &s;peak of &s;ecular matters; but, in return, what little he &s;ays is mo&s;t ju&s;t and authentic. We can only learn from him, that the Britons were confined to the we&s;t of England; and &s;eem in his time to have held all the we&s;tern &s;hore, from Cumberland to Cornwall; as for their &s;tates, or divi&s;ions, we learn nothing, he &s;peaking of them only in general, by the name of Britones, or old Britons. From Nennius, and Samuel his helper, who both wrote about 858, we learn as little; they mentioning only the Britons in general, as Beda; and relating little or nothing, but con|cerning Vortigern and Hengi&s;t, &s;o that they might from their &s;tory be placed in 620, as &s;ome have done, as well as at their real period<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">The work of Nennius and Samuel is not a <HI>hi&s;tory,</HI> but an account of the &s;ettlement of the various nations in Britain. It goes no lower than Vortigern's death, 473. But the Welch have no connection with the early Briti&s;h kings, who were Belgie, or Engli&s;h. Their hi&s;tory begins about the year 600, after the were pent up in pre&s;ent Wales. Nennius in his pre|face dates his work 858, in the 24th year of king Mervin. A critical examination of Welch hi&s;tory is much wanted; but Iri&s;h and Welch hi&s;tory can only be examined by per&s;ons perfectly &s;killed in the&s;e languages, e&s;pecially the ancient, which differ as much from the modern, as Saxon and Engli&s;h, or as all other languages do.</NOTE> The Danes
<PB N="93" REF="180">began to invade England in the eighth century, generally ravaging the north; and &s;eizing on Northumberland entirely in 876 held it ever after. In &s;uch confu&s;ion, and want of information, no wonder we learn nothing of the Britons in Cum|berland, while the knowlege of Bernicia, an ad|joining Anglic kingdom, has almo&s;t peri&s;hed; and that of Northumberland, tho the mo&s;t powerful of the heptarchy, is mo&s;t ob&s;cure. In Cumbria no &s;aint, or writer, happened to be born or conver|&s;ant. The mo&s;t covetous invaders turned with contempt from it's wild mountains and ro|mantic lakes, now &s;o much admired. They pro|duced no gold, nor pearls. Deer and goats were not objects of prey. The inhabitants lived con|cealed amid their mountain barriers; and neither glory nor gain could &s;pring from attacking them. And who encounters danger, where neither glory nor gain can be got?</P>
<P>The very fir&s;t mention we find of the Cumbri is by the Engli&s;h hi&s;torians, in treating the reign of Edward the Elder (900&mdash;925); when they are mentioned among the nations who owned him as father and lord.</P>
<P>In 937 we find Eugenius, or Owen, king of Cumbria &s;urrendering to Edmund of England. <HI>Will. Malm&s;b.</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>In 938 we find the &s;ame king at the great and famous battle of Brunenburg. <HI>Idem,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>In 945 Edmund gave Cumbria to Malcom I. of Scotland, on condition of homage, and defending the north of England again&s;t the Danes. <HI>Saxon Chron. Hoveden, Huntingdon, Malm&s;bury.</HI> Mat|thew of We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;ays, that king Edmund, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Leolin, king of Demetia, (South Wales), de&s;poiled Cumbria of all its wealth. and, depriving of their eyes the two &s;ons of Dun|mail, king of that province, gave it to Malcom, king of Scotland, to be held of him, and on con|dition of defending the north of England, by &s;ea
<PB N="94" REF="181">and land, from the incur&s;ions of enemies. This Dunmail is the only Welch king of Cumbria, who&s;e name is pre&s;erved by Engli&s;h writers. There is a very &s;light re&s;emblance between his name and that of Dunwallon, the la&s;t king of Strat-Clyde; but the difference is great enough to prevent any &s;u&s;|picion of the one being taken for the other; and it was &s;urely after the death of Dunmail, and during the minority of his &s;ons, that Edmund conquered Cumbria in 945; whereas Dunwallon died in 972, or after.</P>
<P>After this &s;urrender of Cumbria to Scotland, the heir apparent of the Scoti&s;h crown was gene|rally appointed prince, or king as then &s;tiled, of that province, and re&s;ided in it as in a di&s;tinct &s;overeignty.</P>
<P>In the reign of Edgar of England (959 to 975) we find a Malcom king of Cumbria, under Ken|neth IV. of Scotland, who &s;ucceeded in 970.</P>
<P>In the year 1000 Ethelred of England wa&s;ted Cumbria. <HI>Simeon of Durham.</HI></P>
<P>In 1054 Siward, Earl of Northumberland, was &s;ent by Edward king of England to a&s;&s;i&s;t Malcom, &s;on of the king of Cumbria, in a&s;&s;erting his claim to the Scoti&s;h throne. Siward died in 1055, having re|turned to Northumberland; but Malcom a&s;cended the throne in 1056. Thus Hoveden and other Engli&s;h writers &s;tile Malcom III. &s;on of the king of the Cumbri; and rightly, as &s;hall be &s;hewn in Part V. After this, Cumbria &s;eems to have been immediately held by the kings of Scotland, and not committed to the charge of the &s;ucce&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>I have intentionally re&s;erved Fordun's hints about Cumbria to the end. The fir&s;t mention he makes of Cumbria is lib. IV. c. 21. where he tells, that Con&s;tantin, &s;on of Ed (904&mdash;944), gave Cumbria to Eugenius, &s;on of Dovenald, his apparent &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or. This te&s;timony of Fordun is &s;trongly con|firmed by William of Malm&s;bury, the chief of the Engli&s;h hi&s;torians, and who wrote in the Twelfth
<PB N="95" REF="182">century; for he names Eugenius as king of Cum|bria in 934. But how &s;hall we reconcile it with that of Matthew of We&s;tmin&s;ter, concerning the &s;ons of Dunmail? If one authority mu&s;t fall, Matthew's mu&s;t yield, for he did not write till two centuries after William. But Matthew's is cir|cum&s;tantial, and apparently true, &s;o that to re|concile both would be be&s;t. Con&s;tantin of Scot|land, a warlike and active prince, had apparently &s;eized on Cumbria, and appointed Eogan, or Eugenius, king; which was, as Fordun &s;ays, in the &s;ixteenth year of his reign, or in 920. Edward the Elder, in who&s;e reign this happened, was occu|pied in con&s;tant conte&s;ts with the Danes; and perhaps he favoured Con&s;tantin's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Cumbria, as a new check on the Danes; and if the kings of the Scots and Cumbri acknowleged Edward as lord, it mu&s;t have been on this occa|&s;ion. In 934 Athel&s;tan king of England quarrelled with Con&s;tantin, and ravaged the &s;outh of Scot|land. Eugenius king of Cumbria &s;eems on this event to have taken refuge in Scotland; and Wil|liam of Malm&s;bury, and others, &s;ay he &s;urrendered his crown to Athel&s;tan, either now, or in 938, after the great battle of Brunenburg. Upon this the old line of Cumbrian kings naturally came to the throne; and Dunmail &s;eems to have been the heir, who was dead, as appears before 945, when his &s;ons were torn from the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion by Edmund. This account has every probability on it's &s;ide, and much more veri&s;imilitude than that Edmund &s;hould conquer the kingdom, and pre&s;ent it to Malcom. Such pre&s;ents are rarely made. It was however proper and rea&s;onable, that homage &s;hould be performed for it to the kings of Eng|land, within who&s;e dominions it lay. The Danes were then the great &s;courge and terror of the Engli&s;h kings; and Edmund &s;eems to have followed the policy of Edward, and to have been glad by re&s;igning a province, never in fact &s;ubject
<PB N="96" REF="183">to England, to acquire a powerful va&s;&s;al in his de|fence again&s;t the Danes.</P>
<P>Fordun in the &s;ame book, ch. 26, tells that Edmund knowing the Cumbri to favour the Sco|ti&s;h more than the Engli&s;h, and wi&s;hing Malcom as an ally again&s;t the Danes, delivered up Cumbria to him and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors for ever. Con&s;tantin had, as Fordun &s;ays, introduced the cu&s;tom of ap|pointing the heir to the throne, king of Cumbria. In 953, the fir&s;t year of his reign, Indulf appointed Odo, &s;urnamed Duff, &s;on of Malcom, king of Cumbria. (Fordun IV. 27.) To Duff who a&s;|cended the Scoti&s;h throne in 961, &s;ucceeded Malcom his &s;on: who is mentioned by Engli&s;h hi&s;torians as king of Cumbria, in the reign of Ed|gar (959 to 975). Then followed another Mal|com, &s;on of Kenneth IV. in the time of Ethelred (979&mdash;1016) and of Kenneth IV. who died 992. It was in his time that Ethelred A^o 1000 ravaged Cumbria, becau&s;e Malcom refu&s;ed tribute. (For|dun IV. 36.38). In 1001 this Malcom a&s;cended the throne of Scotland, having &s;lain Grim; and, toward the middle of his reign, gave Cumbria to Duncan, his grand&s;on, who &s;ucceeded him in 1031. Upon which another Duncan, the &s;on of the Scoti&s;h king, was appointed king of Cumbria. He is the la&s;t king of Cumbria mentioned; Mal|com III. his &s;on, who acceded to the throne of Scotland in 1056, keeping that principality in his own hands, as did his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, till the reign of Malcom IV. (1163), who &s;urrendered Cumbria to Henry II. of England.</P>
<P>In the Welch writers we might expect &s;ome in|telligence concerning the Welch line of kings of Cumbria. Caradoc mentions that Kentigern, who lived about 600, was grand&s;on to URIEN king of Cumbria<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Urien lived about 560; and many notices concerning him may be found in Evans's Specimens of Welch Poetry. He was the mo&s;t famous of all the kings of Cumbria, being the <HI>Urbgen</HI> of the additions to Nennius, <HI>cap. ult.</HI> and in his court flouri&s;hed the three great Bards Talie&s;in, Aneurin, and Llywarch Hen. Evans gives &s;pecimens of their poetry; and they are all in <HI>rime,</HI> in the &s;ame form with tho&s;e he gives of the 13th century! It was a common trade with the bards to forge poems in the names of celebrated praedece&s;&s;ors; and the&s;e pretended pieces are palpably of the Eleventh and Twelfth centuries. Was Mr. Evans ignorant that rime was not u&s;ed till a late period? That Mr. Gray &s;hould be impo&s;ed on by &s;uch pieces would be &s;urprizing, did not all know that hi&s;toric Antiquities are not &s;tudied in Britain. <HI>Apage Nugas!</HI></NOTE>, and &s;on of Owen, regent of Scotland,
<PB N="97" REF="184">for &s;o the Welch writers &s;ometimes called Strat-Clyde, as being the only Welch kingdom in Scot|land; as the Scots, from the &s;ame rea&s;on, rever&s;ed the name, and called it <HI>regnum Cambren&s;e,</HI> or the Welch kingdom. The &s;ame writer mentions that about 616 Eneon Bhrenin, a king of the&s;e Scots, as he calls them, re&s;igning his royalty, came to Llyn in Gwyneth (North Wales), where he built a church, &s;till called from him Llan Eingan Bhrenin, near which he lived in religious retirement. The title of king was in the&s;e days as general as that of prince now in Germany: any independent baron was a king: and thus we find, in Caradoc, kings of Cardigan, Dyfed, and Guentland, in Wales. That Eneon was not the king of Strat-Clyde is clear from Jocelin: and indeed Caradoc him&s;elf adds, 'a con&s;iderable prince in the north of Bri|tain,' which were ridiculous, had he been the king. This Eneon our author &s;ays, was &s;on of Owen Danun, &s;on of Eneon Irth, &s;on of CUNETHA Wledic king of Cumbria. This Cunetha lived, as we learn from Price's De&s;cription of Wales<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Prefixt to the la&s;t edition of Caradoc of Lancarvo Lon|don, 1697, 8vo.</NOTE>, 540 years after Chri&s;t. Urien &s;eems to have &s;uc|ceeded him in the throne of Cumbria.</P>
<P>If we tru&s;t Langhorne's authorities<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">In his Chronicon Regum Anglorum, Londini, 1679, 8vo. he gives the following table. '<HI>Reges Cumbriae et Aleludae.</HI> Na|vus $eu Caunus Gildae pater. Hoel, Huelin, vel Cuil. Anony|mus pater Sancti Petroci. Marcus. Angu&s;ellus Lothi et Uriani frater. Evenus Uriani filius.

This li&s;t is full of errors by confounding Cumbria and Stratclyde, and by taking &s;ome from Geofrey of Monmouth and Lluyd, no authorities.
<P>The kings and nobles of the North are noted in Welch poetry, as Mr. Evans remarks in his Fragments of it. Aneurim, author of the Gododin, was of the North; and perhaps from Welch MSS. we might learn whether of Stratclyde, or Cumbria.

Humphrey Lluyd mentions a CONSTANTINE, king of Cumbria, killed at Lochmaben about 870; upon which event, as he &s;ays, many of the Welch of Cumbria and Strat-Clyde pa&s;&s;ed to Clyde in Wales, and erected a kingdom called Strat-Clyde: but, as Williams &s;hews that not a tittle of this can be found in any Welch Annals, Lluyd &s;eems to have forged this relation, &s;o that it mu&s;t be regarded as a mere dream. And tho there is every rea&s;on to think that on the de&s;truction of the Welch kingdom of Cumbria in 945, and of Strat Clyde about 970, a great part of their inhabitants went to Wales, yet they there mingled with their brethren, and pre|&s;erved no &s;eparate di&s;tinction; el&s;e they could not have e&s;caped the notice of Giraldus, &s;o particular in other matters. Lluyd finding the fir&s;t mention, as he &s;uppo&s;ed, of the Strat-Clyde Welch by the Engli&s;h hi&s;torians, under the year 875, and wi&s;h|ing to draw all he could to his own dear country, invented that unauthorized fal&s;ehood.

<PB N="99" REF="186">There is no rea&s;on to imagine that the little Welch vale of Clyde was ever mentioned in Engli&s;h hi&s;|tory; and even in that of Wales it is only men|tioned twice, as ravaged, or encamped in, by the Engli&s;h, when they attacked Wales on the north. Caradoc, or his interpolator, &s;ays, that after the death of Roderic the Great king of all Wales, in 876, many of the Welch of Strat-Clyde and Cumbria pa&s;&s;ed into Wales under one Hobert, becau&s;e they were much troubled by the Danes in their old &s;eats. This is extremely probable, as we know from A&s;&s;er, and others, that the Danes in 875 ravaged the country of the Piks, and Strat-Clyde. But the&s;e refugees erected no kingdom, nor &s;eized any country from the Saxons, as Lluyd pretends. And we know from the mo&s;t authentic writers, as above &s;hewn, that the Welch held Cumbria till 945, and Strat-Clyde till about 970, at lea&s;t. Llwyd is even &s;o ignorant as to make his Con&s;tan|tine, who, as he fables, was killed at Lochmaben in 870, king of a va&s;t territory, including Strat-Clyde, Cumbria, and Galloway!

<P>ALL the inhabitants of Britain were anciently, as now, &s;tiled Britons, tho of very different origins. The Belgae of the &s;outh and ea&s;t, who were Germans, and u&s;ed the Scythic or Gothic tongue, were equally Britons with the Cimbri, Cumri, or Welch, of the we&s;t, who were Celts. The Caledonians of the north, who were al&s;o Germans from Scandinavia, are called Britons by Tacitus, Herodian, and Dio; and with the utmo&s;t pro|priety, as inhabitants of Britain: ju&s;t as now the Engli&s;h are Britons, as well as the Welch, tho

But, after the Roman power had been a long time e&s;tabli&s;hed in Britain, the name of Britons was con&s;idered as confined to the pro|vincials; and toward the clo&s;e of the third century, or the year 296, we fir&s;t find the Piks, or Caledo|nians, mentioned as not Britons, but enemies of the Britons, even from the time of Julius Cae&s;ar<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Panegyr.

<P>In the great ignorance which attended the de|cline of the Roman empire, the affairs of Britain, ever ob&s;cure, becau&s;e of the di&s;tance of this iland from Rome, the &s;eat of &s;cience, were clouded with almo&s;t total darkne&s;s. In&s;omuch that about 550 we find Procopius<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Lib. IV. and &s;ee Appendix.</NOTE> de&s;cribing Britain as the land of departed &s;ouls. No wonder then that in Britain it&s;elf, where no writers aro&s;e, all genuine mate|rials for hi&s;tory &s;hould peri&s;h. Gildas, the fir&s;t Briti&s;h writer, was born in the year of the battle of Badon, as he tells us, ch. 26. that is in 520; and he wrote, as he there &s;ays, forty years after it, or in 560. A tumultuous period of more than a cen|tury had elap&s;ed, between the arrival of the Saxons and his time; and, as there was no difference be|tween the Belgae and Saxons in &s;peech, and the later had made the former their <HI>coloni</HI> and &s;laves, Gildas naturally thought his Welch countrymen the genuine Britons, and calls them Britons exclu|&s;ively; an error which modern indolence and &s;u|perficiality have, as u&s;ual, blindly followed. Indeed the Roman troops who held Britain, being &s;tationed along the walls of Antoninus and Hadrian, and in the mid&s;t of the Welch inhabitants of Britain, called them Britons, and their tongue the Briti&s;h; regarding the Belgae late &s;ettlers, and the Welch as the people produced by the iland it&s;elf, or genuine Britons.

The&s;e inaccuracies are under&s;tood at the time; but in the cour&s;e of ages cau&s;e great con|fu&s;ion. It is therefore nece&s;&s;ary to attend to them; and to reflect that at fir&s;t, as natural, the Romans called all the nations found in Britain by the name of Britons; that, after they had &s;ubdued the greater part of it, they naturally blended the whole inhabitants of the &s;ubdued part under the name of Britons, calling the Caledonians, or Piks, who were alone un&s;ubdued, by their own name; and that the Welch were peculiarly called Britons then, as now; tho they by no means con&s;tituted all the Britons. Without attending to the&s;e circum&s;tances, we &s;hall fall into an error found in the modern writers; namely that the Piks and Belgae were Welch, becau&s;e they were Britons. The Piks and Belgae were indeed Britons, as the Engli&s;h now; but no more Welch, or Celts, than the Engli&s;h now. There is nothing new under the &s;un; and antiquaries might avoid many errors by recour&s;e to analogy. So much for the Piks being called Britons by Tacitus, and others; who at the &s;ame time call them Caledonians, and their country Caledonia.</P>
<P>That the Caledonians and Piks were one and the &s;ame people is now univer&s;ally allowed; and it is almo&s;t ridiculous to &s;hew this, for, as the an|cient Spartan &s;aid to him who had compo&s;ed an eulogy on Hercules, <HI>Does any one di&s;prai&s;e him?</HI> &s;o it may be &s;aid here, <HI>Is any one ignorant of this?</HI> Bu|chanan, Camden, Lloyd, Innes, Whitaker, the Macpher&s;ons, O'Conor, D'Anville, tho differing widely in other points, all join here.

<PB N="106" REF="191" MS="Y">U&s;her i cannot tell what to make of, for he pro|duces the words of Tacitus, that the Caledonians were of German origin, to &s;hew that the Piks were of Scandinavia; and the words of Eumenius, &s;hewing the Caledonians to have been Piks, and that the Piks infe&s;ted the Britons before the time of Julius: then he gives us Geofrey of Monmouth; from whom he draws three later Piki&s;h colonies to have entered Britain after the time of Chri&s;tianity. It is impo&s;&s;ible even to gue&s;s at his thoughts on the occa&s;ion. In his whole work there is a mo&s;t re|markable defect of under&s;tanding. All authorities are quite alike to him. Tacitus and Hector Boe|thius, Beda and Geofrey of Monmouth; hi&s;torians, and fabuli&s;ts; writers of the fir&s;t century, and of the &s;eventeenth; are all jumbled together in uni|form confu&s;ion; are all quoted with equal atten|tion, and confidence. If one were de&s;ired to men|tion a work capable of &s;hewing that an author may be va&s;tly and profoundly learned, without po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ing common judgement, U&s;her's <HI>Antiquitates Bri|tannicarum Eccle&s;iarum</HI> might be produced as an in&s;tance. Yet is this work precious as a common|place book, for he gives all that all have &s;aid upon his &s;ubject: and, had his judgement equalled his learning and diligence, he would have been the mo&s;t valuable antiquary that the Briti&s;h ilands ever produced. With regard to the three colonies, as they re&s;t &s;olely on Geofrey of Monmouth, and authors who follow him, i &s;hall not abu&s;e the reader's attention &s;o far, as to offer even one re|mark on them.</P>
<P>It once appeared to me, before i had fully exa|mined this &s;ubject, that the Piks were a new race, who had come in upon the Caledonians in the third century, and expelled them; and that the Caledo|nians were Cumraig Britons.

For ancient au|thors are the &s;ole guides to real truth in hi&s;toric antiquities; conjectures and arguments are only ingenious lyes.</P>
<P>That the Caledonians and Piks were the &s;ame, is in fact as uncontrovertible, as that the &s;ame peo|ple who called them&s;elves <HI>Hellenes</HI> were called <HI>Graeci</HI> by the Romans. This will appear to the reader from the accounts of the ancients concerning them, which &s;hall here be briefly &s;tated, and will at once a&s;certain their identity.</P>
<P>Tacitus is the fir&s;t writer from whom information can be drawn on this &s;ubject; for, before the campaign of Agricola, Caledonia was unknown to the Romans. He calls this country, being all that part of Britain which is to the north of Loch Fyn and Tay, by the &s;pecial name of CALEDONIA; and that always when it is mentioned, &s;o that the name was fixt and preci&s;e. The people he calls by the general name of <HI>Britanni;</HI> but expre&s;&s;ly gives his opinion that they came from Germany, becau&s;e they re&s;embled the Germans in their large per&s;ons, and red hair<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Namque rutilae Caledoniam habitantium comae, magni artus, Germanicam orginem a&s;&s;everant. <HI>Agricola.</HI></NOTE>; whereas he thinks the other Britons came from Gaul. This &s;ufficiently marks the Britons of Caledonia to have differed from the re&s;t: and the &s;igns given by Tacitus are, in a &s;avage &s;tate of &s;ociety, very &s;triking and obvious.</P>

"From the <HI>Lelamo|nius Sinus</HI> (Loch Fyn) to the frith of <HI>Varar</HI> (Murray) are the Caledonii; and above them the Caledonian Fore&s;t." As the province Ve&s;pa&s;iana exi&s;ted in Ptolemy's time, he regards it as Roman, and the Caledonians as confined beyond it's limits, that is in the pre&s;ent highlands.

<P>Dio who wrote about 230, or the century after Ptolemy, al&s;o calls this people Caledonians. As all Britain up to the wall of Hadrian had now long been provincial, that part was regarded as wholly Roman; and this writer &s;peaks of the Maeatae, or Cumri between the walls, and the Caledonians be|yond them, as the only two nations in Britain; that is the only two nations who kept up the Briti&s;h name as <HI>Barbari,</HI> not <HI>Romani.</HI> For the provincials were often &s;tyled <HI>Romani;</HI> and the world was re|garded as either <HI>Romanus,</HI> or <HI>Barbarus.</HI> A di&s;tinc|tion as old as the days of Ovid, who u&s;es <HI>Barbaria</HI> often, in his <HI>Tri&s;tia,</HI> for all without the Roman pale.</P>
<P>In 296 the name of PICTI is fir&s;t u&s;ed by Eume|nius the Panegyri&s;t, in his oration, &s;poken at the end of that year, upon the victory of Con&s;tantius over Allectus. The pa&s;&s;age is a famous one; and the more &s;o, as it's con&s;truction in the old editions puzzled Buchanan, and the be&s;t Latin &s;cholars. No apology need therefore be made for dwelling a little on it's explanation. A large piece of the preceding text is al&s;o given that the connection may be clear.</P>

<P>The &s;entence beginning <HI>Adhoc natio,</HI> &amp;c. and in which the Piks are mentioned, is mo&s;t ob&s;cure. Buchanan propo&s;es to under&s;tand <HI>&s;oli Britanni</HI> in the genitive, 'of the Briti&s;h &s;oil;' and the mean|ing would be 'Moreover the nation then rude, and only u&s;ed to the Piks and Iri&s;h of the Briti&s;h &s;oil, enemies even half naked, ea&s;ily yielded to the Roman arms.' Strange that Buchanan<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Sir George Mackenzie attempts to confirm Buchanan's in|terpretation, from Lucretius,

But Sir George ought to have known that poetical licence will never authorize pro&s;e.

But let us hear the unpreju|diced interpretation of foreigners, who do not &s;ee with the jaundiced eyes of our &s;ickly antiqui&s;ts, and indeed &s;o uniformly give every point again&s;t them, that they are left, like &s;traw-crowned kings, to enjoy their frenzy and darkne&s;s alone. Jaques de la Baune, the learned editor of the edition for the u&s;e of the Dauphin, gives us the &s;entence, and notes, thus:</P>

<P>This correction of Acidalius was mo&s;t plau&s;ible, and approved by all, till the la&s;t valuable edition of the Panegyri&s;ts, by Schwarzius and Jaeger, ap|peared at Nurenberg, 1779, in two volumes octavo. In which, from an excellent manu&s;cript often u&s;ed and referred to in that edition, this famous &s;entence &s;tands ultimately blamele&s;s, and perfect, thus:</P>

<P>If, with Acidalius, who wrote about the year 1620, we had redd <HI>&s;oli Britanni,</HI> we mu&s;t have under&s;tood that Cae&s;ar fought with <HI>Britons alone,</HI> whereas Allectus had al&s;o Roman &s;oldiers; &s;o that Con&s;tantius did more than Cae&s;ar, as he fought not with Britons alone, but with Romans. But this reading of the MS. above-mentioned, puts this out of the que&s;tion; and the whole pa|&s;&s;age above produced may be tran&s;lated as follows. The Panegyri&s;t, to &s;hew the greatne&s;s of the ac|tions of Con&s;tantius in Britain, compares them to tho&s;e of Julius Cae&s;ar.</P>
<PB N="111" REF="196">
<P><Q>&startq;<HI>Which iland of Britain when Cae&s;ar, he the au|thor of your name, had entered fir&s;t of the Romans, he wrote that be had found another world; thinking it of &s;o great &s;ize, that it might teem not to be &s;ur|rounded with the ocean, but to embrace and com|mand it. But &s;till in that age Britain was pro|vided with no &s;hips for naval war; while Rome, even from the Punic and A&s;iatic wars, and al&s;o recently exerci&s;ed with tho&s;e of the pirates, and of Mithridates, flouri&s;hed not more by land than by &s;ea. Moreover the nation he attacked was then rude; and the Britons, u&s;ed only to the Piks and Iri&s;h as enemies, and being yet them|&s;elves but half naked, ea&s;ily yielded to the Roman &endq;arms and en&s;igns.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Eumenius lived at Augu&s;todunum, or Autun, in Burgundy, a place now &s;o famous for it's num|ber of Roman antiquities, that it has been called the French Rome. He was there profe&s;&s;or of rhetoric<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">See the prolegomena to the editions of the Panegyri&s;ts, <HI>Delphini,</HI> or <HI>Schwarzii.</HI></NOTE>; and pronounced this oration in pre|&s;ence of Con&s;tantius Chlorus, on his victory over Allectus, who had &s;lain Carau&s;ius, and u&s;urped the imperial title in Britain, and who fell in the battle which was fought in the year 296. All commen|tators agree that this oration was pronounced in the end of that year. Con&s;tantius was then only <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> whence Eumenius calls Julius the author of his name, which was always given to an apparent &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or to the empire. This cu&s;tom of pronouncing panegyrics on the Emperors and Cae&s;ars, in their pre&s;ence, &s;eems to have begun in the time of Tra|jan; and Pliny's Panegyric on that prince, pro|nounced in his pre&s;ence, is extant and well known. Greater accuracy in facts, and in expre&s;&s;ion, was naturally expected, and nece&s;&s;arily exerci&s;ed, on &s;uch &s;olemn and trying occa&s;ions, when the fir&s;t audience in the world were witne&s;&s;es of the narra|tion
<PB N="112" REF="197">of their own actions, than even in hi&s;tory, where the writer remained unawed and unchecked in the &s;ilence of his cabinet. Hence the great anxiety expre&s;t by Eumenius and the other Pane|gyri&s;ts. In his oration to Con&s;tantine, the Ninth in the collection, Eumenius expre&s;&s;es the utmo&s;t awe on the occa&s;ion; and &s;ays that what is &s;poken mu&s;t be <HI>diu &s;criptum, et &s;aepe tractatum,</HI> 'a long time written, and often revi&s;ed.' And, in be|ginning this to Con&s;tantius, he is more than or|dinarily &s;ollicitous, ob&s;erving, among other points, <HI>Quo in genere orationis quanta e&s;&s;et cura, quantus labor, quam &s;ollicita veneratio!</HI> 'In this kind of oration how great the care, how &s;evere the labour, how anxious the veneration!'</P>
<P>As &s;uch accuracy and care were required, and Eumenius, from his re&s;idence in Gaul, had oppor|tunity for all information concerning Britain, we may rely upon his te&s;timony as mo&s;t authentic. And it is valuable, not only for the very fir&s;t men|tion of the Piks, but as it &s;hews that, even before the time of Julius, they had infe&s;ted the Britons. Now the Britons, in all the&s;e orations, are uni|formly the provincial Britons. At this time, as formerly &s;hewn, the name of Maeatae had utterly peri&s;hed; and there is every room to believe that, when Carau&s;ius divided Britain from the Roman empire, in the yeat 286, the Maeatae gladly joined their Briti&s;h brethren, in a&s;&s;erting his right again&s;t the Roman Emperors; and that under him their name was lo&s;t in the general one of Britons. For, after this period, the Roman writers know of no Britons beyond the Clyde and Forth. The Piks are con&s;idered as not Britons, tho undoubtedly in Britain. When all were barbarous alike, all the nations in the iland were Britons: but in proce&s;s of time the nations &s;outh of the Clyde and Forth became romanized; and it was di&s;covered that the Caledonians, or people beyond the&s;e rivers, were quite a di&s;tinct people from the Cumraig Britons,
<PB N="113" REF="198">their &s;outhern neighbours, and the chief inhabi|tants of the iland in number. The name of Ca|ledonians, or Woodlanders, given them by the Welch, was exchanged for their real name, the name they gave them&s;elves, PIHTAR, latinized PICTI. Perhaps it may be thought that as the Piks were really the <HI>Vik Veriar</HI> of Norway, and had that name in all appearance long before they came to Scotland, Eumenius meaned to expre&s;s the inva&s;ions of Britain by the Piks from Norway, before they effected a &s;ettlement. But it will be afterward &s;hewn that the Piks were que&s;tionle&s;s &s;ettled in that part of Britain which lyes north of the Clyde and Forth, long before the time of Julius, &s;o that this idea mu&s;t fall of cour&s;e. And the Romans could have no knowlege that the Piks ever were in Norway, or ever invaded Britain from thence, if they even knew that Norway exi&s;ted: they only knew them as of Caledonia, a country now long divided from provincial Britain, and con&s;idered as another land. That Eumenius, in particular, only regarded them in this view will appear from another pa&s;&s;age of his, now to be produced.</P>
<P>This occurs in the panegyric to Con&s;tantine I. &s;on of Con&s;tantius, &s;poken in March 310, as the commentators &s;hew, and is at full length as follows:</P>
<Q>Dies me ante deficiet, quam oratio, &s;i omnia Patris tui facta, vel hac brevitate, percurram. Cujus etiam &s;uprema illa expeditio non Britannica tropoea, (ut vulgo creditum e&s;t) expetivit; &s;ed, diis jam vocan|tibus, ad intimum terrarum limen acce&s;&s;it. Neque enim ille tot tanti&s;que rebus ge&s;tis, non dico Caledonum aliorumque Pictorum, &s;ilvas, et paludes, &s;ed nec Hi|berniam proximam, nec Thulen ultimam, nec ip&s;as, &s;i quae &s;unt, Fortunatorum in&s;ulas, dignatur acquirere: &s;ed (quod eloqui nemo voluit), iturus ad deos, genitorem illum deorum ignea caeli a&s;tra refoventem pro&s;pexit Oceanum; ut, fruiturus exinde luce perpetua, jam
<PB N="114" REF="199" MS="Y">videret illic diem poene continuum. Vere enim profecto illi &s;uperum templa patuerunt y receptu&s;que e&s;t con|&s;e&s;&s;u cali Jove ip&s;o dexteram porrigente.</Q>
<P>This pa&s;&s;age has no variation whatever, either in MSS. or editions. To under&s;tand it, we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the Caledonians or Piks making in|cur&s;ions into provincial Britain in 306, Con&s;tan|tius Chlorus, who a year or two before became Emperor <HI>(Augu&s;tus)</HI> of Gaul and Britain, prepared to repel them. As he was &s;etting &s;ail from Gaul for that purpo&s;e, his &s;on Con&s;tantine, (afterward the fir&s;t Chri&s;tian Emperor), whom Galerius had detained in Italy as an ho&s;tage, e&s;caped, and came to him. They proceeded into Britain to|gether, when the Piks were repelled; and Con|&s;tantius &s;oon after died of a fever at York, that &s;ame year. The Panegyri&s;t, with rhetorical fancy, takes advantage of this expedition of Con&s;tantius, ju&s;t before his death, into the north of Britain, famous among the Romans for the &s;un's being hardly ever beneath the horizon in &s;ummer, and for being regarded as another Thule, and extremity of the world. Hence the orator repre&s;ents this expedition into the &s;ecret rece&s;&s;es of the ocean, perpetually enlightened by the &s;un, as a meet preparation of Con&s;tantius for his journey to the ely&s;ian fields, which were pictured with &s;imilar circum&s;tances, of remote &s;tation in the ocean, and eternal &s;un&s;hine. Take this tran&s;lation.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;<HI>The day would fail before my oration, if i were to run over all the deeds of thy father, even with this brevity. His la&s;t expedition did not &s;eek for Briti&s;h trophies, (as vulgarly believed,) but the gods already calling him, he came to the mo&s;t &s;ecret bound of the earth. For by &s;o many, and &s;o great, actions, be deigns not to acquire, i will not &s;ay the woods and mar&s;hes of the Caledonians and other Piks, but Ireland which lyes nighe&s;t, nor di&s;tant Thule, nor even, if &s;uch there be, the Ilands of the Fortunate them&s;elves; but, (what none inclined
<PB N="115" REF="200">to &s;peak,) being about to go to the gods, he beheld the ocean, that father of the gods, refre&s;hing the fiery &s;tars of heaven; that being about thence to enjoy perpetual light, he might have a fore&s;ight of eternal day. For in the end of &s;pring, the temples of the gods were open to him; and he was received into the a&s;&s;embly of heaven, Jove him&s;elf reaching to &endq;him his right hand.</HI></Q></P>
<P>It appears unque&s;tionably from this pa&s;&s;age that the Caledonians were Piks: and this is happily marked by the very author who fir&s;t u&s;es the name of <HI>Picti,</HI> &s;o that not a doubt can remain even with the mo&s;t ignorant.

'In Britain, when the excur&s;ion of the Scots and Piks, fierce nations, having broken the peace, ravaged the APPOINTED GROUNDS, next to the boundaries,' &amp;c. The&s;e CONDICTA LOCA, or GROUNDS MU|TUALLY APPOINTED AND AGREED ON near the boundaries, were &s;urely tho&s;e of the future pro|vince of Valentia: and this pa&s;&s;age &s;trongly con|firms the idea that the bounding wall was not regarded as the utmo&s;t limit of Roman power, but that there was a warlike frontier-territory be|yond it; which in times of peace was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Romans, and defended by them in times of war. For they were not &s;uch cowards as to act on the defen&s;ive alone; and from behind their wall. The wall was as that of a city; and a large territory lay beyond it. In this pa&s;&s;age of Am|mianus, the very fir&s;t mention of the Scots ap|pears; and it is immediate, and pre&s;ent; not re|tro&s;pective, as that of the Piks by Eumenius, From Eumenius we learn that the Piks exi&s;ted in the time of Julius Cae&s;ar: from Ammianus, that the Scots exi&s;ted Four Hundred and Ten years after, or in the year 360. It is mo&s;t remarkable, that Eumenius never mentions the Scots, but by the general name of <HI>Hiberni;</HI> and he joins tho&s;e <HI>Hiberni</HI> with the Piks, as Ammianus does the <HI>Scotti.</HI> The&s;e Scotti of Ammianus were infallibly, as &s;hall be &s;hewn, the people of Ireland. They &s;ailed from Ireland to Argyle, and the neighbour|ing &s;hores of Pikland; where it was nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould join their allies, that they might act in conjunction: for it is remarkable, that we never
<PB N="117" REF="202" MS="Y">find them attacking the Britons in Wales, or in|deed at all, &s;ave in conjunction with the Piks; while the Caledonians or Piks were always making incur&s;ions alone. But of the Scots fully hereafter.</P>
<P>Under the year 364, Ammianus has <HI>Picti, Sax|one&s;que, et Scotti, et Attacotti, Britannos aerumnis vexavere continuis.</HI> 'The Piks, and Saxons, and Scots, and Attacotts, vexed the Britons with con|tinual harra&s;&s;ments.'</P>

Con&s;tans was made Cae&s;ar in 334; and three years after came to the empire, and reigned thirteen years, or to 350.

The lo&s;s of that part of Ammianus is irreparable; as his te&s;ti|mony would have put the hi&s;tory of Scotland, at the fir&s;t revival of literature, upon quite another footing, by &s;hewing at once what we are now obliged to glean from many minute lights, that
<PB N="118" REF="203"><HI>Scotti</HI> was but a new name for the <HI>Hiberni</HI> or Iri&s;h Goths, now beginning, like the Caledonians, to be known by the name they gave them&s;elves: and that <HI>Attacotti,</HI> or Hither Scots, was but a name given the Dalreudini, or fir&s;t colony of Scots that &s;ettled in Argyle, about the year 258, as &s;hall be after &s;hewn.</P>
<P>This pa&s;&s;age of Ammianus is of it&s;elf a &s;uf|ficient proof that the Caledonians and Piks were one and the &s;ame people.

For he &s;ays that, <HI>cum plurimam in&s;ulae partem incipientes ab au&s;tro po&s;&s;edi&s;&s;ent</HI> [Briztones] <HI>contigit gentem Pictorum

The Britons of Beda were the Welch, whom he regarded as indi|genes, knowing nothing of the Gael who preceded them. But that the&s;e Welch or Cumraig Britons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all Britain for centuries before Julius is unknown to none. Beda proceeds, <HI>Itaque pe|tentes Britanniam Picti habitare per &s;eptentrionales In&s;ulae partes coeperunt: nam au&s;trina Britones occu|paverunt.</HI> lb. 'Therefore the Piks going to Britain, began to inhabit the Northern parts of the iland; for the Britons had &s;eized the Southern.' The&s;e Northern parts of Beda were all north of Clyde and Forth, as is clear from ch. 12. of this book of his Hi&s;tory, and other places, where he de|&s;cribes the Piks as coming from the north, and explains that he means the north of the firths of Clyde and Forth, which were indeed in the time that the wall of Antoninus was fir&s;t abandoned, as above &s;hewn, the natural bounds between the terri|tories of the Caledonians, and the Southern Britons. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to dwell longer on a &s;ubject &s;o uni|ver&s;ally known and allowed, as the identity of the Caledonians and Piks, and which indeed no one can deny who does not prefer his own dreams to ancient authorities of the be&s;t note, &s;o that laughter, and not confutation, &s;hould he employed again&s;t him.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER II.</HI> The opinion of Camden and Lloyd, and that of the two Macpher&s;ons, concerning the Origin of the Piks, examined.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE &s;hewing the real origin of the Piks, it becomes nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;cu&s;s two erroneous opinions, which have been formed concerning it. It is granted by all, and indeed beyond a doubt, that the Piks mu&s;t either have proceeded from Scandinavia, Germany, or the South of Britain; and that they mu&s;t have been either Goths or Celts. If Goths, they &s;poke the Gothic tongue, the pa|rent of the pre&s;ent German, Dani&s;h, Engli&s;h; &amp;c. If Celts, their &s;peech was either Cumraig, that of the German Celts; or Gaelic, that of the Gaulic Celts.</P>
<P>That they were Goths &s;hall be &s;hewn in the next chapter, from the con&s;ent of all the ancient writers, and from other arguments. That they were Celts is the opinion now to be confuted. The authors who a&s;&s;ert the Piks to have been Celts are divided in their &s;entiments: for I. <HI>Camden,</HI> writing his Britannia, con&s;ulted &s;ome &s;illy Welch antiqui&s;t about etymologies, and other matters, as he did not under&s;tand Welch him&s;elf<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This appears from Camden's MSS. In the Briti&s;h Mu&s;aeum.</NOTE>. This &s;ame Welch prophet wi&s;hing to make all great folks Welch, as his countrymen delight to do, tho the honour be generally rejected, thought he might
<PB N="122" REF="207" MS="Y">lay violent hands on all the fame of the Piks; and thus led Camden into a blunder, which a Welch mind could alone originally form. This opinion Mr. <HI>Lloyd,</HI> another Welchman, al&s;o gave<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">In the Preface to his Archaeologia, 1707.</NOTE>. Innes fell into it, and it forms the radical blemi&s;h of his book. II. The two <HI>Macpher&s;ons,</HI> led by the &s;ame wi&s;e Celtic ideas, de&s;ire we &s;hall in future, know the Piks to be Gaelic, 'of hur own dear blood and bone:' and they &s;ay believe otherwi&s;e at your peril; for are not we &s;killed in old Celtic, and new, in non&s;en&s;e and nonentity? And what are Tacitus, and Ammianus, and Beda, and all the&s;e old fools to us? Do not we know more than them? Are not we two new wi&s;e men of quite a new &s;chool?</P>
<P>The fir&s;t opinion that the Piks were Welch, i &s;hall &s;eriou&s;ly examine, as &s;uch men as Camden and Innes have adopted it. But i &s;hall fir&s;t &s;ay a very few words to the &s;econd, as &s;oon as laughter will permit me to go on; for it is impo&s;&s;ible to pre&s;erve one's mu&s;cles, when one meets with utter ab&s;urdity and ignorance in the garb of wi&s;dom and learning.</P>
<P>Were i &s;eriou&s;ly to argue in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;cience, that the Piks were not merely a branch of the Gaelic race, who went from Ireland to the we&s;t of Scotland, where they were known in all ages, as at pre&s;ent, for a &s;et of Celtic &s;avages, incapable of any progre&s;s in &s;ociety; i &s;hould be in as awkward a &s;ituation as when &s;hewing again&s;t Mr. Macpher&s;on that the Sarmatians were not Germans, and that a Ru&s;&s;ian is not an Engli&s;hman. Dr. and Mr. Macpher&s;ons <HI>a&s;&s;ert</HI> that the Scoti&s;h Highlanders are the real Caledonians, and the Piks a part of them; the only di&s;tinction being that the former lived on the north and we&s;t; while the latter lived on the ea&s;t and &s;outh. Such opinions have attended, and of them&s;elves fully mark, the
<PB N="123" REF="208" MS="Y">utter decline of learning in Scotland; for every man who has redd much on the &s;ubject, knows them to be ab&s;olutely ignorant and fal&s;e, and con|tradictory to all authorities and facts. In the dark <HI>&s;trange phantoms appear,</HI> but in the light we view only real objects. When the tide of learning again flows in Scotland, it will &s;wallow up for ever tho&s;e weeds and vermin; which its ebb has left on the &s;hore. Superficial dablers talk of opinions: men of experienced learning talk of authorities and facts. An ignorant writer will advance any opinions that &s;ooth his &s;ickly fancy, or gratify his prejudice; becau&s;e he is ignorant of the truth, ignorant of his danger, ignorant of the contemptuous thoughts entertained of him by others.</P>
<P>Why &s;hould i produce the whole writers, ancient and modern, from the fir&s;t century to the eighteenth, to &s;hew that the Piks were quite a different people from tho&s;e Iri&s;h Highlanders? In the next part it will be &s;hewn, that the later pa&s;&s;ed from Ireland in the year 503, and were long confined to Argyle, as the Attacots had been before them: and that even the Attacots, 'the fir&s;t Iri&s;h colony that ever &s;et foot in Pikland, did not arrive there till 258. I need not produce all the ancients whom Mr. Macpher&s;on &s;ays, with &s;o much mode&s;ty, that he has examined and confuted. Mr. O Conor well ob&s;erves that he has done this by the &s;econd fight; and he accordingly bears the &s;uperb epithet of <HI>&s;econd-&s;ighted</HI> among the Iri&s;h antiquaries. The next chapter of this work, and the Fourth Part, in which the origin of the Old Scots is treated, will &s;ufficiently &s;hew from all ancient authorities that the opinions of the two Macpher&s;ons, are truly Celtic, fooli&s;h, and ignorant in the extreme. Heaven forbid that a regular an&s;wer &s;hould be given to &s;uch weak vi&s;ionaries, who are five or &s;ix centuries behind the re&s;t of mankind, and not &s;o knowing now as Geoffrey of Monmouth, their
<PB N="124" REF="209" MS="Y">brother, was in the Twelfth age! But this whole work is one an&s;wer to them, tho mo&s;t uninten|tionally; for in it is &s;hewn, from facts and au|thorities, that neither Piks, nor Scots, were the earlie&s;t known inhabitants of Scotland; that the Caledonians or Piks were Goths, and differed as widely from the, Dalriads or Highlanders who were Celts from Ireland, as a Dane from a wild Iri&s;hman.</P>
<P>The opinion of Camden, and of Innes, calls for quite other treatment. Re&s;pectable and mode&s;t writers are entitled to be an&s;wered with re&s;pect and with mode&s;ty: while tho&s;e, who&s;e &s;uperciliou&s;ne&s;s and impudence can only be matched by their &s;uperficiality and ignorance, de&s;erve not that regard which they never &s;hew to others. The rea&s;ons, if they may be &s;o called, for the opinion that the Piks were Welch, are,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That Tacitus, Herodian, and Dio, call them Britons.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That they were painted as the other Britons.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That the names of mountains and rivers on the ea&s;t of Scotland, where the Piks dwelled, are often Welch.</ITEM>
</LIST> Of all the&s;e in order.</P>
<P N="1">I. That the Piks are called Britons by Tacitus, Herodian and Dio, is no more to be wondered at, than that the Engli&s;h are now called Briti&s;h, or that the Engli&s;h in America are called Americans; tho the Engli&s;h, it is humbly pre&s;umed, be neither Welch, nor American &s;avages. In the beginning of the la&s;t chapter this was &s;poken of; and this argument is &s;o &s;illy, that it is unnece&s;&s;ary to take up the reader's time with it. How came the Belgae of the &s;outh to lo&s;e their came in that of Britons, tho they were infallibly Germans, &s;peak|ing the Gothic tongue, and no more Welch than the Engli&s;h are? Was it not becau&s;e that, if a hundred nations, of a hundred different origins, had been &s;ettled in Britain, they would all have been with the &s;tricte&s;t propriety called Britons? Let me here an&s;wer an <HI>argument</HI> of Mr. Lloyd's
<PB N="125" REF="210" MS="Y">of equal pondero&s;ity; heavy indeed as lead, and which may however be melted with the &s;lighte&s;t fire. He &s;ays, 'that the Piks were Britons with|out que&s;tion, appears by the name of them in Latin and Iri&s;h.' I know not whether this <HI>rea&s;on</HI> be Latin or Iri&s;h. The Latin name is <HI>Picti,</HI> from the name they gave them&s;elves <HI>Pihtar,</HI> as the Saxon Chronicle &s;hews. The Iri&s;h is <HI>Cruithneich,</HI> which, as &s;ome Celtic dreamers &s;ay, means <HI>painted,</HI> others &s;ay it means <HI>wheat-eaters;</HI> and it appears to me to be a mere patronymic, as common with the Celts, from <HI>Cruthen</HI> the fir&s;t king or leader of the Piks. Thus <HI>Dalreudini</HI> were from <HI>Reuda,</HI> &amp;c. But an author mu&s;t have a right Celtic under|&s;tanding who builds on &s;uch trifling non&s;en&s;e. Mr. Lloyd tells us, that the old Briti&s;h manu|&s;cripts call the Piks <HI>Fitchid Guydhelians.</HI> And the Guydhelians, he &s;ays, were the Gaelic abori|genes of Britain who were driven into Ireland by the Welch. I &s;u&s;pect from this that the word Guydhelians was u&s;ed for any aboriginal, or mo&s;t ancient inhabitants. But this &s;eems to be one of the mi&s;takes, which tho&s;e learned in Welch &s;ay are not unfrequent in Lloyd, who is thought to have known Iri&s;h better than the antiquities of his own country, for his countryman Humphry Lloyd &s;ays, the Welch annals call the Piks <HI>'Phichjaid, id e&s;t, Phichtianos.'</HI> And Sir John Price, in his de&s;cription of Wales, &s;ays, that in the &s;ixth cen|tury <Q>&startq;<HI>Y Gwydhyl Phictiaid,</HI> which is to &s;ay, the &endq;<HI>Iri&s;h Picts,</HI> did over-run the I&s;le of Man.</Q> Now that many Piks were &s;ettled in Ireland is certain from Adomnan, in his life of St. Columba, Probus the old author of the Life of St. Patrick, the Annals of Tighernac and Ul&s;ter, and other pieces of Iri&s;h antiquity: and Lloyd &s;eems to have mi&s;|taken the <HI>Gwydhyl Phichtiaid,</HI> or <HI>Iri&s;h Piks,</HI> for the real original Piks. Indeed names and facts, that are &s;o unfortunate as to pa&s;s thro Celtic &s;trainers, receive &s;o deep a tinge of non&s;en&s;e, that it is almo&s;t
<PB N="126" REF="211" MS="Y">impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;cover their genuine hue. It is al&s;o mo&s;t ri&s;ible to &s;ee Mr. Lloyd have the Celtic marks upon him; for his argument is &s;elf-con|tradictory. He de&s;cribes the Guydhelians as a race preceding the Welch; and their &s;peech as more ancient than the Welch; yet he &s;ays the Piks were certainly Welch, becau&s;e they are called <HI>Guydhyl Phichtiaid,</HI> or Guyhelian Piks in old Welch MSS. that is, the Piks were Welch becau&s;e &mdash;they were not Welch. If Lloyd had any mean|ing at all in the&s;e &s;trange arguments, it was, that the Piks were Britons, becau&s;e their name, as he dreamed, implied both in Latin and Iri&s;h that they painted them&s;elves, as the other Britons did: and this leads to the &s;econd argument.</P>
<P N="2">II. That the Piks were Welch Britons, becau&s;e they painted as the Britons did. This argument is al&s;o &s;elf-contradictory, for there is not the &s;malle&s;t authority to believe that the Welch Bri|tons, or any Celtic people, ever painted them|&s;elves at all. It was a cu&s;tom common among the Gothic nations, to make them&s;elves look terrible in war; and was with them, a mark of nobility, &s;o that, as the ancients &s;ay, the mo&s;t noble had the greate&s;t number of figures &s;tained on his body<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Herodot.

He al&s;o mentions that the Budini had red hair, and blue eyes, and were a great nation. The red hair and blue eyes were the two grand features of the Scythians, or Goths; of whom de&s;cended the Ger|mans and Scandinavians, &s;o noted for tho&s;e fea|tures in ancient and modern authors. Mela<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">I. 19.</NOTE> ap|parently from Herodotus, &s;ays the Budini lived in large de&s;erts, while the Geloni had a wooden town. The name of Budini is not, it is believed, mentioned by other writers; and that of Geloni &s;eems to have &s;wallowed it up, as Herodotus &s;ays it had in his time among the Greeks. By the Ge|loni we mu&s;t therefore under&s;tand not the mixt Greeks of Gelonum; but the wide nation of the Budini where it lay. The&s;e Geloni are, by Pliny, and Solinus, placed beyond the fountains of Bory|&s;tenes, or Nieper, and next beyond them were the Agathyr&s;i, whom Ptolemy and others place on the ea&s;t &s;hore of the Baltic in pre&s;ent E&s;thonia. Mela &s;pecially remarks, that among the Agathyr&s;i the&s;e marked &s;tains were &s;igns of nobility, as the per&s;ons were more or le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed by them<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Agathyr&s;i ora artu&s;que pingunt: ut qui&s;que majoribus prae&s;tat ita magis vel minus: caeterum ii&s;dem omnes notis, et &s;ic ut ablui nequeunt.

Agathyr&s;i is apparently a Greek name, from the thyr&s;us of Bacchus, who&s;e my&s;teries they delighted in; as the Thyr&s;agetae, another Gothic nation, haply received their name from the &s;ame cau&s;e. For all the Scythians, or Goths, were in their fir&s;t &s;eats great celebrators of Bacchus; who, by all appearance, was a monarch of the primitive Scy|thic Empire in A&s;ia; and a great conqueror, who made a famous expedition into India, and from thence introduced the vine into his dominions.
<PB N="129" REF="216">Hence his orgies were celebrated by the Scythians, or Goths, in climates where the vine was unknown; and the wine of barley, as they called it, or ale, &s;upplied it's place. The Thracian bacchanals are mo&s;t celebrated, and from them pa&s;&s;ed to Greece; tho Thrace was cold, and no vines grew there. The real name of the Agathyr&s;i is unknown; but that they were Scythians, Goths, Germans, is ap|parent from all accounts. Stillingfleet<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Origines Sacrae.</NOTE> plau&s;ibly thinks them the very people afterward called Piks: and that they were a branch of the Peukini, or Ba&s;ternae (whom i take to be the Peohtar, or Piks) &s;eems probable becau&s;e the Peukini, and Sitones are the only Scythians, Goths, Germans, who can be traced up to the &s;outh-ea&s;t &s;hores of the Baltic, and into Scandinavia; as &s;hewn at length in the Di&s;&s;ertation annexed to this work.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arii,</HI> a nation in the very heart of Germany, are al&s;o &s;pecially mentioned by Tacitus<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">In Germania.</NOTE> to have u&s;ed this practice of &s;taining their bodies.</P>
<P>But it may be &s;aid that this practice does not ap|pear to have been general among the Germans, el&s;e Tacitus would have remarked it; and that tho the Scandinavians may have u&s;ed this prac|tice, without it's ever coming to the knowlege of the Romans, who knew next to nothing of Scan|dinavia, yet it is not to be conceived that, had the Southern Germans and continental Belgae, u&s;ed a practice &s;o uncommon, end new to the Romans, it could have e&s;caped the &s;pecial notice of Cae&s;ar, who warred with them, and of Tacitus who re&s;ided among them, as Procurator, or Lieutenant Go|vernor of Belgium. How then came it to be u&s;ed among the Belgae of Britain, and not among the Belgae of Gaul?</P>
<P>To this be it an&s;wered, that the practice was an ancient one, wearing out gradually. The fir&s;t German nations we find mentioned in hi&s;tory, the
<PB N="130" REF="217">Agathyr&s;i, and Geloni, u&s;ed this cu&s;tom; and it is rea&s;onable to think it was then practi&s;ed by many other German nations, as we find it in the time of Tacitus retained by the Arii. The <HI>gla&s;tum,</HI> or woad, was not every where to be found; and in would &s;eem that, even in Pliny's time, the Briti&s;h Belgae had it from Celtic Gaul, where no u&s;e was made of it<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Simile plantagini gla&s;tum in Gallia vocatur; quo Britan|norum conjuges, nuru&s;que, toto corpore oblitae, quibu&s;dam in &s;acris, et nudae, incedunt, Aethiopum colorem imitantes. XXII. 1.</NOTE>. If in the heart of Germany we find the Arii, not a di&s;tinct people, but only a tribe of the Lugiones, retaining this cu&s;tom, tho the other tribes of the Lugiones had it not, is there any wonder that a part of the Belgae &s;hould keep it after the others had dropt the practice? Surely the former ca&s;e is &s;tronger than the later; for the Arii were not divided from their brethren, &s;ave by imaginary bounds; while the Briti&s;h Belgae were &s;eparated by the &s;ea, and in a world apart. It mu&s;t al&s;o be remarked that in ilands, as con|taining remote, di&s;tinct, and &s;eparate &s;ocieties, all old cu&s;toms, traditions, &amp;c. are retained much later than in the vague and mixt continent. Thus in Scandinavia, which is &s;o nearly an ile, that it may be called one, the old Scythian, or Gothic manners, traditions, &amp;c. were retained many cen|turies longer than in Germany: and in Iceland, tho very lately peopled, &s;till many centuries lon|ger than in Scandinavia, &s;o that all Eddas, Sagas, &amp;c. are of Iceland. Britain was even, by Cae&s;ar, in the then improved &s;tate of Roman navigation, regarded as another world. No wonder then that it's inhabitants retained many cu&s;toms for centu|ries after they had been dropt by their brethren of the continent. The Belgae of Britain were, as all allow, &s;ettled here three or four centuries before. Cae&s;ar, when the cu&s;tom of &s;taining their bodies was, in all likelihood, retained by many of the
<PB N="131" REF="218">German nations, and by them in particular. Hence it is not &s;urely matter of he&s;itation that the Briti&s;h Belgae &s;hould &s;till &s;tain their bodies; while their ance&s;tors of the oppo&s;ite &s;hore had abandoned the practice, and conformed to the more advanced &s;tate of &s;ociety, which the Greeks of Mar&s;eilles had by degrees introduced into Gaul. And when we know from Tacitus that the Arii, a part of the Lugiones, u&s;ed this cu&s;tom, while the other Lu|giones did not, all he&s;itation mu&s;t &s;urely vani&s;h.</P>
<P>That the Celts ever &s;tained their bodies, there is not one authority, if i mi&s;take not, that can &s;hew. Had the Cimbri, Cumri, Cimmerii, or German Celts, who once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, from the Euxine to the Briti&s;h &s;ea, u&s;ed this mode, &s;o remarkable a cir|cum&s;tance could never have e&s;caped the old Greek authors, who mention the Cimmerii, nor the Ro|man authors, who &s;o particularly de&s;cribe the per|&s;ons of the&s;e Cimbri who fought with Marius. That the Gauli&s;h Celts diet not u&s;e it, is plain from Cae&s;ar, who, tho he delineates the mo&s;t minute matters concerning them, &s;ays nothing of this; but mentions it as a novelty, when he comes among the Belgic Britons. But were we to grant for one moment, that the Cumraig Britons had this cu&s;tom, it is palpable they mu&s;t have re|ceived it from their Gothic neighbours and inmates, the Piks on the north, or the Belgae on the &s;outh. Or to clo&s;e all argument on the point, let us grant, tho a palpable fal&s;ehood, that the Welch Britons exclu&s;ively had this practice at fir&s;t, what would the u&s;e of it among the Piks prove, but that, as a fa&s;hion, it had pa&s;&s;ed to them from their &s;outhern neighbours? Are we of Britain all French, be|cau&s;e we dre&s;s our&s;elves after the French, and not after the Spani&s;h fa&s;hion? Thus the argument is, in every view, not only futile, but puerile. Let us now pa&s;s to an argument of real weight, and the only one &s;uch that can be offered on the &s;ubject.
<PB N="132" REF="219">III. That the Piks were Welch, becau&s;e the names of rivers and mountains, in tho&s;e parts of Scotland where they dwelled, are often Welch. To him who has redd the fir&s;t Part of this work this argument mu&s;t fall of it&s;elf. For he will there &s;ee that the Cumri actually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Scotland for centuries before the Piks came in. Rivers and Mountains are perpetual, and their names cannot be ea&s;ily changed; while towns, and other works of man, are peri&s;hable, and their names are often altered. Hence in Greece and A&s;ia many rivers, and mountains retain, to this day, the names by which they were known to Homer, 900 years be|fore Chri&s;t, and perhaps actually bore 900 years be|fore Homer. Yet the&s;e parts have pa&s;&s;ed thro many &s;cenes of barbari&s;m, and utter de&s;olation; while in Scotland there has been but one change of inhabitants on the ea&s;t, when the Piks drove out the Cumri; and but four on the we&s;t, when the Piks &s;ucceeded the Cumri, and then gave up that part to the Dalriads, which was afterward &s;ub|dued and held by the Norwegians, tho not ex|clu&s;ive of the Dalriads, the mo&s;t numerous inhabitants. But it is the ea&s;t and &s;outh parts which here require our notice: and that in the former names of rivers and mountains &s;hould &s;ome|times be &s;till Cumraig, is &s;urely no matter of wonder when the Piks expelled the Cumri only about two centuries before Chri&s;t. Had this event happened two thou&s;and years before Chri&s;t, the&s;e names would have nothing &s;urprizing.</P>
<P>But as the &s;ubject of names of places in Scotland has been &s;eldom touched, a few remarks &s;hall here be offered upon it. And fir&s;t &s;ome hints &s;hall be premi&s;ed concerning what is called the Celtic language.</P>
<P>In the Gothic language we have a monument of the fourth century, namely the Go&s;pels, and other fragments of the Scripture, as tran&s;lated by Ulphi|las, bi&s;hop of tho&s;e Goths who pa&s;&s;ed the Danube, and &s;ettled in Mae&s;ia. The work which Ovid tells
<PB N="133" REF="220">us he wrote in this language has unhappily pe|ri&s;hed; but it mu&s;t have been a fixt and exact &s;peech before Ovid's time, el&s;e he could not have written in it. Accordingly we find it, in the Go&s;|pels of Ulphilas, as perfect and grammatical as the Greek, or Latin; and with perhaps as few anomalies as the&s;e tongues. Of this Gothic the Anglo-Belgic, commonly called Anglo-Saxon, of Caedmon and Alfred in the eighth and ninth age; and the Francic, Theude&s;que, and Icelandic, of &s;everal writers from that period, are mere dialects. The Codes of the Vi&s;igoths, Burgundians, &amp;c. from the fifth century, al&s;o pre&s;erve many words and &s;entences of the Gothic tongue; as do Jor|nandes, and other early writers. So that the Gothic may be regarded as a fixt and written language from the Fourth century, to this day that it's dialects prevail over Germany, England, Scotland, and the Northern kingdoms. In the days of Ulphilas the Goths were quite unmixed with any other people; as was al&s;o the ca&s;e with the Angli of the heart of Germany, and with the Icelanders.</P>
<P>Very different was the lot of the Celtic tongue. The Goths, pouring in from A&s;ia, almo&s;t exter|minated the Celts, or ancient &s;avages of Europe, by the ferocious mode of carrying on war, &s;o u&s;ual in the earlie&s;t times. In Germany but a few Cimbri, or Celts, were left about a hundred years before Chri&s;t; and of the&s;e few the greater part fell by the &s;word of Marius; the &s;mall remnant, confined to a little point on the &s;ea, as Tacitus de|&s;cribes, was either cut off by the Germans, or quite lo&s;t as a drop in the ocean. In Gaul, as more di&s;|tant from the Gothic progre&s;s, the Celts retained their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions longer. Cae&s;ar found a third part of Gaul &s;till held by the Celtae; that is, chiefly; for the boundaries of Celtic Gaul, the Seine and Rhone, as marked by Cae&s;ar were geographic and arbitrary: and we find, among his Celtae, nations
<PB N="134" REF="221">certainly Germanic, as the Senones, or Semnones, the Boii, &amp;c. However, even excluding the&s;e na|tions, one third of Gaul was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Celts in Cae&s;ar's time: but the&s;e Celts, in a cen|tury or two, totally exchanged their &s;peech for the Latin; and Strabo-vouches that even in his time the Latin was &s;poken generally in both Gaul and Spain. Nor does a &s;crap or the Celtic exi&s;t preceding the Tenth century, when by mixture it had become partly Latin, partly Gothic. The ancient Gauli&s;h, or Celtic, is therefore univer&s;ally marked by the learned as a lo&s;t language.</P>
<P>In Wales, indeed, and in Ireland, the form, and grammar, and doubtle&s;s many words of the two grand Celtic dialects, the Cimbric or Cum|raig, and the Gauli&s;h, or Gaelic, have been pre|&s;erved. But unfortunately the Welch were &s;ub|ject to the Romans, and incorporated with them, for four centuries: nay, for centuries before the Romans arrived, they had been &s;urrounded by Gothic nations, the Piks and Belgae. The Saxons al&s;o and Danes altered the Welch vocabulary by an influx of Gothic words; and when the language fir&s;t appears in writing in the laws of Howel Dha, of the tenth age, and other genuine works, the grammar is indeed Cumraig, but the body of the language is as much Gothic, and low Latin, as Celtic. The reader mu&s;t attend that it is a &s;in|gular quality of the Celtic tongue, to corrupt and deba&s;e others, to it's own vague form, and e&s;pe|cially by altering the beginning of words; &s;o that it becomes as difficult to recognize them, as to know a per&s;on in a ma&s;k. A modern Engli&s;h word, or name, when cloathed in the Celtic habit, becomes as &s;ingular and old-like as a real Celtic word of two thou&s;and years &s;tanding.</P>
<P>In Ireland where, as Leibnitz ob&s;erves, the Celtic mu&s;t be found if any where, an equal, if not greater, mixture took place than in Wales. The old Iri&s;h grammarians, as Mr. O'Conor re|marks,
<PB N="135" REF="222" MS="Y">call the Iri&s;h tongue <HI>Berla Tabide,</HI> or a mixt &s;peech; and with great propriety, for Cum|ri, or Welch, and Belgians and Piks from Britain, had all their &s;hare in the Iri&s;h tongue, even about the birth of Chri&s;t. Afterward the Danes &s;ettling in Ireland, ruled it for centuries; and there is no fragment of Iri&s;h extant, which can be placed prior to the Dani&s;h &s;ettlement. Neverthele&s;s the Gauls, or Celts, who fir&s;t peopled that noble iland, &s;till remaining the mo&s;t numerous, the grammar and &s;tructure of the &s;peech are infallibly Celtic; and it is as difficult to recognize the foreign words in Iri&s;h as in Welch, or more &s;o. A learned Hungarian has ob&s;erved, on the language of his own country, that tho the grammar and &s;tructure re&s;emble the Hunni&s;h, or Turki&s;h, yet the words are very different, being generally either German, or Slavonic<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Kol in notis ad Olahi Hungariam, Vindob. 1763, 8vo. p. 91. note.</NOTE>. This will ever be the ca&s;e in an ancient, but mixt language, for the form, grammar, or &s;tructure of a &s;peech is radical, and fundamental: the words are in con|&s;tant fluctuation. Nay the modern Greeks are an unmixed people; and tho the grammar be the &s;ame, how different is ancient Greek from modern! In like manner the Iri&s;h and Welch retained the Celtic grammar; but their &s;peech even in it's earlie&s;t remains is no more Celtic than the Hun|garian is Turki&s;h.</P>
<P>Some late &s;uperficial dreamers have a&s;&s;erted, that the Gaelic of the Highlands of Scotland is the pure&s;t dialect of the Celtic! This opinion was un|happily advanced by people who tell us that poems, yet repeated in the Highlands, were re|peated there in the &s;ame words in the third cen|tury. <HI>Au miracle! Au miracle!</HI> Immortal languages of Greece and Rome, what are your glories to the&s;e! All the eternal monuments of your authors
<PB N="136" REF="223" MS="Y">could not fix the &s;poken language half &s;o long, as that of there &s;avages has &s;tood upon it's own bottom. Certain it is, that in Wales and Ireland even the mo&s;t learned find it difficult to interpret manu&s;cripts of the twelfth and thirteenth age; and, were a poem of that period to be put into the hands of any of our highland tran&s;lators, he would &s;tamp, and &s;tare, and give up the pur&s;uit. Over all the globe, it &s;eems, language, mixt or un|mixt, has changed with time, &s;ave in this fa|voured &s;pot, where Eternity has built a ne&s;t for her own phoenix. Among the mountains of Swiz|zerland and Bi&s;cay, the language is quite changed and corrupted; but among the mountains of Scot|land the mutability of human affairs has no power. No doubt a Celtic under&s;tanding will always be a Celtic under&s;tanding; and that folly imputed to the Celts by the Greeks and Romans<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Diodor. Sic. V. p. 354. marks the ob&s;cure &s;peech, and con&s;equently under&s;tanding of the Celts.
<Q>Et tumidus Galla credulitate fruar.</Q>
Says a Roman poet: and another has
<Q>Vaniloquum Celtae genus.</Q></NOTE> remains un|impaired. But this Gaelic of the highlands is doubtle&s;s more corrupt than either Welch, or Iri&s;h. For the Attacots, or Dalreudini, who fir&s;t &s;ettled in Argyle about 258, were a &s;mall colony from the north of Ireland, where both the Tuath de Danan, or Cumri, and the Cruitnich, or Piks, had e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves: nay were them|&s;elves mo&s;tly Scots, or Goths of Ireland, tho in that country, being lo&s;t among the numbers of Celts who had fled there as to the la&s;t refuge, they had adopted the Celtic tongue, but doubtle&s;s re|tained much of the language of their ance&s;tors, the Gothic. The Attacots were driven back to Ire|land in the fifth century. In 503 they returned with reinforcements under Loarn and Fergus, and remained fixt. On all hands, &s;ave the we&s;t,
<PB N="137" REF="224" MS="Y">where the &s;ea was their boundary, they were &s;ur|rounded by Piks and Welch: the former were their allies, and no doubt many Piks remained among the new &s;ettlers, and many intermarriages took place. The Welch of Alclyde, or Strat-Clyde, appear al&s;o to have had much intercour&s;e with the Attacots, Dalriads, or Highlanders. Above all; in the ninth century, the Hebudes were &s;eized by the Norwegians, who held them for about four hundred years. Not a fragment of the Gaelic has been found in Scotland older than the Fourteenth age; and it is perfectly known that the pre&s;ent Gaelic of the highlands of Scotland is quite full of Norwegian words. Hence this &s;peech mu&s;t be much more corrupt than any other Celtic dialect; ina&s;much as it's written monu|ments are five centuries more modern, and, before the writing began, a grand revolution and total intermixture had long exi&s;ted. For in the&s;e ilands of Hebudes, the Celtic tongue had a better chance than in the highlands of Scotland, where con&s;tant intercour&s;e with the Piks, or Lowlanders, on one &s;ide, and the Norwegians on the other, mu&s;t have totally changed it. In &s;hort, tho&s;e &s;killed in the Celtic of Ireland pronounce that of the highlands of Scotland a corrupt dialect, even of the Iri&s;h Celtic, which is it&s;elf totally corrupt. In the whole highlands, and we&s;tern iles of Scot|land, are numerous de&s;cendents of the Piks and Norwegians; and the Iri&s;h &s;peech and manners &s;pred over parts uninhabited by Iri&s;h, &s;o that, as &s;hall after be &s;hewn, the inhabitants of the&s;e coun|tries are as mixt as their &s;peech. The Celts being natural &s;avages, and regarded as &s;uch by all wri|ters of all ages, their tongue was &s;imple and poor, whence they were always borrowing of others; while hardly in modern European language can one word derived from the Celtic be found. Our Celtic &s;eers of etymology, ignorant of all the&s;e facts, derive modern words from the Celtic, with|out
<PB N="138" REF="225">&s;u&s;pecting the real truth, that the Celtic words are derived from them. Without complete know|lege of the Gothic, and it's dialects, no man ought to meddle with Celtic etymology, el&s;e he will blunder in utter darkne&s;s. For want of this know|lege, Mr. Whitaker has derived near 3000 Eng|li&s;h words from the Welch, which had in fact pa&s;t from the Belgic, Saxon, and Dani&s;h, into the Welch; and mo&s;t of them may be found in the Gothic, Theude&s;que, and Icelandic, to which they could never pa&s;s from the Welch. The Goths were the conquering people, and &s;uperior in all things to the Celts; and &s;o numerous that they &s;pred over all Europe, and great part of A&s;ia, many centuries before Chri&s;t, while the Celts were pent up in two or three little corners.</P>
<P>Celtic etymology is indeed the peculiar madne&s;s of this &s;uperficial age. Etymology of names, whe|ther of per&s;ons, or places, has been in all ages &s;yno|nymous with complete folly. In the old time <HI>Britain</HI> from <HI>Brutus, Scandinavia, a &s;candendis, navibus, Vi&s;urgis, quod vi &s;urgat,</HI> were thought pretty and apt. Next Hebrew and Phoenician etymologies were introduced by Bochart. Now Celtic is the word; and etymologi&s;ts are more mad than ever, for the Latin and Hebrew were fixt and ancient tongues; whereas this Celtic is a vague mixture of many languages, and &s;o &s;oft and indeterminate in orthography, that, as Buchanan ob&s;erves of the etymology of his time, <HI>ex quolibet quodlibet fit,</HI> you may make what you plea&s;e of whatever you plea&s;e. We have &s;een Arthur's &s;eat, and other common Engli&s;h names, derived from the Celtic! Indeed you may derive what you plea&s;e from it; and with as much ju&s;tice and truth, as Dean Swift ludicrou&s;ly derives Greek and Latin names from plain Engli&s;h. We dream that the&s;e Celtic names ju&s;t fit the per&s;ons, places, &amp;c. but never dream that three thou&s;and others would all fit ju&s;t as well; and that a cap and bells
<PB N="139" REF="226" MS="Y">would fit &s;till better. Among the Saxon names all over England, Greek names over Greece, Latin over Italy, who has explained, or can ex|plain one? In the name of good &s;en&s;e let us apply this to our Celtic non&s;en&s;e. Every name that is thought with peculiar fitne&s;s to &s;pring from the Celtic, i &s;hall engage to derive with equal fitne&s;s from any tongue in the world, with the help of a dictionary. Suppo&s;e now for a &s;pecimen, we take the Spani&s;h, and apply it to names in the high|lands of Scotland. Take <HI>Sonachan</HI> and <HI>Ardmallie,</HI> names in Argyle&s;hire, which fir&s;t &s;tart to my eye in Mr. Pennant's map, is not hi <HI>Sonada,</HI> a tune, and <HI>chan&ccedil;a</HI> a je&s;t? The fir&s;t place was one where the bards u&s;ed to &s;ing and play, anciently <HI>Sonada|chan&ccedil;a,</HI> now by an ea&s;y contraction <HI>Sonachan.</HI> Is not <HI>Ardmallie</HI> from <HI>Ardid,</HI> a &s;tratagem, and <HI>mal,</HI> ill, a place where a con&s;piracy again&s;t Fingal was defeated? Read Swift, good Celtic etymologi&s;ts; read Swift.</P>
<P>Of all etymology whatever, the Celtic is the mo&s;t uncertain, becau&s;e the language is hardly a written one, and its orthography, on which etymology depends, is quite various and lax. The old Celtic is totally lo&s;t; and to derive old names from the Iri&s;h or Welch Celtic, is as lu|dicrous as it would be to derive ancient names in Greece or Italy, from modern Greek or Italian. Etymology of names, whether of per&s;ons or places is totally delu&s;ive; for we know not the rea&s;on of the name, or whether it had any rea&s;on at all. Such etymology is therefore always folly, but Celtic etymology is &s;heer madne&s;s; for we do not only know nothing of the rea&s;on of the name, but we know not even the Celtic tongue.</P>
<P>In the&s;e remarks, therefore, on names in Scot|land, i have nothing to do with etymology, but merely with the <HI>form</HI> of the name, which marks it Welch, Iri&s;h, or Gothic, as &s;uch names occur in Wales, Ireland, or Germany, and the northern
<PB N="140" REF="227">kingdoms. Thus Clyde, Douglas, Lanerk, are names in Wales as well as in Scotland: <HI>burgh</HI> is common in the Gothic kingdoms, &amp;c. &amp;c. Our ob&s;ervations &s;hall con&s;ider the names of,

<P N="1">I. RIVERS. The&s;e retain their names even longer than mountains, for they often run thro &s;o va&s;t a territory, that to change the name in one &s;pot were mo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary, and incon|venient; and thro the whole, impo&s;&s;ible. On the we&s;t coa&s;t of Scotland there are no rivers beyond the Clyde, but an exuberant number of ex|cellent bays, creeks, and rivulets, &s;warming with fi&s;h, the wealth of the ocean; and which, had not the country been re&s;igned to the &s;avage in|dolence and ignorance of Celts, would, centuries ago, have enriched that &s;hore to a degree &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ing the ea&s;tern. Had the indu&s;trious Goths po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this, as well as the ea&s;t, the&s;e fine na|tural havens would have been adorned with glit|tering towns and villages, and the heathy dales with plenteous harve&s;ts. But when the&s;e Celtic cattle allowed a country &s;o fertile as Ireland, to lye uncultivated, and her &s;pacious plains to run into mar&s;hes, it is no wonder that they have ne|glected the we&s;tern mountains of Scotland. Nor can any progre&s;s in &s;ociety be ever expected from them, &s;o that the plantation of little colonies, from the &s;outh and ea&s;t, is the only plan which can en&s;ure an improvement of the we&s;tern coa&s;t of Scotland.

<P N="3">III. TOWNS. This cla&s;s is the mo&s;t import|ant to the que&s;tion. Towns, among the Scy|thians and Celts, were mere &s;traggling huts placed near each other, but in no order nor contiguity. As the&s;e huts were of wood, no ruins remain. The Celts of Britain and Ireland had, no doubt, &s;uch towns, for they are found even among the mo&s;t &s;avage nations of Lapland, Kamchatka, America, Africa. Cae&s;ar &s;ays of the Belgic Bri|tons, that they gave the name of town, when they fortified a thick little wood with a ditch and rampart<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Oppidum autem Britanni vocant, qu$m &s;ilvas impeditas vallo atque fo&s;&s;a munierunt; quo, incursions ho&s;tium vi|tandae cau&s;a, convenire con&s;ueverunt. <HI>Lib.</HI> V.</NOTE>. But this was a town of defence; and they &s;urely had hovels, a convenience not un|known to the mo&s;t bruti&s;h nations. To &s;leep in the open air, in a Briti&s;h winter, was certainly impo&s;&s;ible. And wherever men are found, huts are found; &s;o that we may &s;afely conclude, that villages or towns, like tho&s;e of the Indians, were &s;cattered all over Britain, and Ireland, upon their very fir&s;t population, perhaps thou&s;ands of years
<PB N="146" REF="233">before Chri&s;t. Ptolemy mentions &s;even or eight towns in all parts of Ireland in his time; and the&s;e towns certainly were not fortified thickets, but large collections of huts. Indeed the word <HI>oppidum,</HI> u&s;ed by Cae&s;ar, and whence fal&s;e ideas concerning the Briti&s;h towns have ari&s;en, means always, in Latin, <HI>a walled town, a fortified town;</HI> and Cae&s;ar's meaning is, that the Britons called &s;uch a wood a <HI>fortified town.</HI> The word <HI>Vicus</HI> is u&s;ed always by Tacitus for what we call a town, an Indian town, as he de&s;cribes tho&s;e of the Ger|mans to be. We mu&s;t therefore under&s;tand Cae&s;ar that the Britons dwelled in <HI>vici,</HI> or large &s;trag|gling villages; and that their only <HI>oppida,</HI> or for|tified places, were &s;uch as he mentions. Tacitus, de&s;cribing the con&s;equences of the defeat of Gal|gacus, &s;ays, <HI>fumantia tecta,</HI> the roofs all &s;moking, the villages being burnt by the Piks in their re|treat.</P>
<P>Now, as, in America, the old name of the In|dian town is often pre&s;erved, when an European town is built on or near the &s;ituation, we may, with all rea&s;on and analogy, apply this univer&s;al practice of new &s;ettlers, barbarous or civilized, to &s;uch names of towns on the ea&s;t of Scotland, as &s;eem Celtic. For the Piks, who drove out the Cumri, mu&s;t have done it by degrees, and been well acquainted with the names of their &s;tates and towns, long before they fell into their hands. But i &s;ay as <HI>&s;eem</HI> Celtic, for i am convinced that what we call the Celtic is &s;o full of old Gothic words, that no man of found &s;en&s;e will take upon him to &s;ay, if the term be really old Gothic or Celtic. Nations al&s;o borrow terms from each other, when they &s;eem much adapted to the &s;ub|ject. Thus we talk of a <HI>Savanna,</HI> a Spani&s;h term for a meadow. So in Scotland, <HI>Strathmore</HI> is the name of a river and it's dale in Sutherland; and Strathnavern, to a late period, that of a large tract on the river Navern, in the &s;ame county.
<PB N="147" REF="234" MS="Y"><HI>Strath</HI> is not found now in Norway, &amp;c. where <HI>Field</HI> is u&s;ed in that &s;en&s;e. Yet i know not if it be a term left by the Cumri, as the Welch have <HI>Y&s;trat Alyn, Y&s;trat Marchelh,</HI> &amp;c. or a Gothic word from <HI>&s;trat, via,</HI> whence our <HI>&s;treet,</HI> the <HI>way of the river;</HI> or from <HI>&s;tracka, extendere,</HI> whence our <HI>&s;tretch,</HI> the &s;tretch or extent of the river. The words <HI>Strath</HI> and <HI>Aber</HI> have been chiefly marked as &s;igns that the Piks were Welch. Yet the granting the&s;e words Welch would only &s;hew that the Piks retained the&s;e terms of the old in habitants, as the European inhabitants of Ame|rica do Indian terms. But i &s;u&s;pect both of them to have pa&s;t from the Gothic to the Celtic; and &s;hall now con&s;ider <HI>Aber</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Beda tells us, that a town at the end of the Northern wall was called Peanvahel, in the Piki&s;h language: '&s;ermone Pictorum Peanvahel.'

But Nennius tells us, that the Welch name was <HI>Penguaal.</HI> And there are no &s;uch words as <HI>Pean, vahel,</HI> or <HI>fahel,</HI> in the Welch language, as the reader will find on look|ing into Davi&s;es Dictionary, or Lloyd. <HI>Pen</HI> in Welch is <HI>the head; gwal, a wall.</HI> So that the Engli&s;h name <HI>Penweltun,</HI> added by Beda, is more Welch than the Piki&s;h.

<P>Now we are told that in Welch <HI>Aber</HI> means the mouth of a river. I know it is in Welch equi|valent
<PB N="148" REF="235">to the French <HI>havre,</HI> a <HI>haven;</HI> and they &s;ay a &s;hip enters the <HI>aber,</HI> &amp;c. But, alack, both in Wales and Scotland, it begins the names of towns many miles from the mouths of rivers, and where not a fre&s;het runs into the &s;tream. Hence Borla&s;e, in his Corni&s;h vocabulary, &s;ays, "<HI>Aber,</HI> a ford; a fall of water; a mouth of a river; a meeting of two rivers." Here are mean|ings enough, becau&s;e Borla&s;e found towns begin|ning with <HI>Aber</HI> in all the&s;e &s;ituations. The fact is, that poor <HI>Aber,</HI> which has been tortured into &s;o many meanings, is ab&s;olute German <HI>Uber,</HI> be|yond, and means &s;imply a town <HI>beyond</HI> a river, an idiom of the &s;peech for <HI>upon</HI> it. Tho indeed it &s;eems to have been always impo&s;ed by the mo&s;t populous or noted neighbourhood, and applied when the town lay beyond the river as to them. And it is &s;uch old Scythic as to be ab&s;olute Greek, <HI><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, upon, above, beyond.</HI> So that it appears to me originally, as in Greek, to have meant <HI>upon,</HI> as well as <HI>beyond;</HI> tho i am not &s;ufficiently ver&s;ed in old German to &s;ay if it, without an idiom, bears both meanings in that tongue<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">The old German <HI>ober,</HI> meaning <HI>upper,</HI> may al&s;o have &s;hare in the Scoti&s;h <HI>Abers.</HI> Our old chronicles put <HI>Apur</HI> for <HI>Aber, Apurnethige</HI> for Abernethy, <HI>Aperfeirt,</HI> &amp;c.

<PB N="149" REF="236">namely, <HI>Uberling</HI> upon the lake of Con&s;tance.

Perhaps the Goths retained &s;everal old Cumraig names both on the continent, and in Britain, not only of rivers and mountains, but of old Celtic towns. But i rather &s;u&s;pect that the Welch, who are a people mixt with &s;uch Belgae, or Briti&s;h Germans, as preferred a &s;tate of pa&s;toral &s;avagene&s;s to the Saxon yoke, received this, with many other words, from the Gothic. For the Welch language, as well as the Iri&s;h, is &s;o full of Gothic words in di&s;gui&s;e, that it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay if any particular word be originally Gothic or Celtic. That the word <HI>Aber</HI> is Gothic is apparent even from this, that the Welch do not under&s;tand the meaning of it. On the whole, &s;uch minute matters are mo&s;t dark and uncertain; but this much is certain, that the <HI>Abers</HI> in Scotland no more prove the Piks Welch, than tho&s;e in Germany prove the Germans Welch. It mu&s;t al&s;o be con&s;idered in examining this point, that, after the Chri&s;tian times, the foundation of a church was commonly that of a town around it; and that the clergy among the Piks were almo&s;t entirely Welch and Iri&s;h, for &s;o little were the Piks addicted to god|line&s;s, that there is not one Piki&s;h &s;aint or even churchman on record. Now the&s;e Welch and
<PB N="150" REF="237" MS="Y">Iri&s;h founders gave Welch and Iri&s;h names to their churches, which, of cour&s;e, pa&s;&s;ed to the towns. Let me ob&s;erve in pa&s;&s;ing, that the above|marked obduracy of the Piks to Chri&s;tianity is it&s;elf a &s;trong &s;ign of their Scandinavian origin, for the people of Scandinavia were &s;o aver&s;e to Chri&s;tianity, that none of them received it till the tenth century. If the Piks were Welch or Iri&s;h, who can account for Pikland being un|known in the Chri&s;tian records, while all Wales and Ireland were &s;warming with &s;aints?</P>
<P>But if the <HI>Abers</HI> could &s;hew the Piks to have been Welch, then, by the &s;ame rule, the <HI>Bals</HI> might prove them Iri&s;h; for names beginning with <HI>Bal</HI> are frequent in Ireland, and al&s;o in the Piki&s;h part of Scotland, as <HI>Balbirny, Balmuto, Bal|merino, Balcarras,</HI> &amp;c. This is another word which might puzzle the mo&s;t profound etymologi&s;t to determine, if really Celtic or Gothic. Nothing is more certain than that <HI>Bal</HI> and <HI>Bally</HI> are mo&s;t fre|quent in Ireland, as initial of the names of towns; and that <HI>Baille</HI> in Iri&s;h implies a city, town or village. In Welch it means the head of a river flowing from a lake, as Twyne &s;ays; but, according to Price, a town: Davies doubts this la&s;t, except that it be from the Latin, <HI>Villa,</HI> or the Arabic, <HI>Balad,</HI> a town. I cannot help ob|&s;erving, that the Welch &s;peech is to this day lit|tle known, for even Lloyd had no great &s;kill in it; and that Iri&s;h interpreters are much more ju&s;t and preci&s;e in di&s;clo&s;ing their language. Nothing is al&s;o more certain, than that in the Icelandic or Gothic, <HI>Bol</HI><NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">'<HI>Bol,</HI> caput, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, Gr. Bolwerk, <HI>Bol,</HI> rotundus.' Wach|ter. '<HI>Bal,</HI> vide <HI>Bol,</HI>' <HI>id.</HI> As the fir&s;t towns were on the tops of hills, the con&s;onance of <HI>caput</HI> and <HI>rotundus,</HI> with a town, is apparent. The Greek <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> and <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> are in &s;ingular agree|ment. <HI>Dun</HI> is another German name for a town, and our word is a corruption of it, '<HI>Dun,</HI> civitas, urbs, oppidum.' Wachter.'<HI>Dun,</HI> mons, collis.' <HI>Id.</HI> '<HI>Dunkel,</HI> occultus, &s;ecretus.' <HI>Id.</HI></NOTE> is a town, or village; and that the
<PB N="151" REF="238" MS="Y">broad <HI>o</HI> is often u&s;ed in the North, where <HI>a</HI> is u&s;ed in Scotland, as in the names of ilands which &s;urround Norway, &amp;c. end in <HI>o</HI> or <HI>oe,</HI> while in the Hebudes and Orkneys they end in <HI>a;</HI> the Scoti&s;h language not having the &s;ound of <HI>oe</HI> in it. The names in Norway ending in <HI>boll</HI> and <HI>bull</HI> are quite numerous. But to clo&s;e this at once, there are even <HI>Bals</HI> enough in the northern kingdoms to &s;hew the word as much Gothic as Celtic; as in Denmark <HI>Ball&eacute;, Balling, Bal&s;lo, Balkar&eacute;, Balkared, Balteberg, Langball,. Nordballe, Ballum, Suderballig, Wull&s;ball, Balligard, Brabal|lig;</HI> in Iceland <HI>Balhokill, Balgar;</HI> in Sweden <HI>Bal|&s;en</HI> ile, <HI>Balsfiord, Balby, Balabygd.</HI> So al&s;o in the duchy of Bremen <HI>Balli;</HI> and in Friezland <HI>Bal|lum;</HI> in Shetland <HI>Bal.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Dal</HI> &s;eems equivalent to <HI>Bal;</HI> and as in Scotland we have <HI>Dal&s;winton, Dal&s;erf, Dalrymple, Dalgus,</HI> &amp;c. &s;o in Norway, Denmark, &amp;c. <HI>Dal</HI> is quite frequent; <HI>as Dalby, Dallerup, Dalby-neder, Dalby|offre, Dalmolle, Dalroth,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>The <HI>Invers,</HI> as <HI>Inverleith, Inverary, Inverne&s;s,</HI> &s;eem al&s;o Gothic; as in Denmark are <HI>Iverfleth, Iver&s;bull,</HI> and <HI>Immerwath,</HI> &amp;c. Yet i believe in Iri&s;h the word means the mouth of a river: but were there ever any Iri&s;h in Denmark? Has not the word pa&s;t from the Gothic to the Iri&s;h?</P>
<P>In Fife&s;hire there are many <HI>Pits,</HI> as <HI>Pitferran, Pitmedie,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. But this name has never been &s;u&s;pected either Welch or Iri&s;h; and &s;uch names are not to be found either in Wales or Ireland; but are frequent in England, as may be &s;een in the Index Villaris.</P>
<P>Let us now produce two &s;pecimens of numerous names on the ea&s;t of Scotland, which are not &s;imi|lar to any, either in Wales or Ireland; and will of them&s;elves turn this point quite the other way. The fir&s;t is of <HI>Kins.</HI>

<P>To &s;um up the&s;e remarks on the names of places in Scotland, which, tho perhaps they may little intere&s;t the reader, have co&s;t me great labour, let it be ob&s;erved,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. That two thirds of the names in the Hebud iles and highlands are infallibly Gothic: This is owing to three cau&s;es,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That the Piks, a Gothic people, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the&s;e countries down to the &s;ixth century, when a &s;mall part was given up to the Iri&s;h who gradually multiplied and &s;eized on the iles and highlands, regions de|&s;pi&s;ed by the Piks, who crowded into the more fertile parts, the &s;outh of Scotland, and north of England.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That the Norwegians in the ninth century &s;eized on the Hebud iles, and parts of the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, which they held four centuries.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That the highlanders, being a &s;avage people, always engaged in petty emotions, many grants of forfeited lands among them were given to low|landers.</ITEM>
</LIST></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. That almo&s;t the whole names of the North, Ea&s;t, and South of Scotland are Gothic, owing to the Piks, a Gothic people po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the&s;e countries; as at times the Norwegians, another Gothic people, held the North; and the Saxons, another Gothic people, the &s;outh. But there are, or at lea&s;t &s;eem, two exceptions to this general rule,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That a few are Cumraig, owing to the Cumri being the fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of all Scotland: and to the churchmen who founded churches, around which towns ro&s;e, being often Cumri, and giving the places Cumraig names.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That a few are Gaelic, owing to the Iri&s;h churchmen, who &s;warmed in Pikland, from the &s;eminary at Hyona, and from Ireland, down to the eleventh
<PB N="156" REF="243">and twelfth centuries; and who denominated their churches, villages, and lands, in their own lan|guage; nay, as being the &s;ole literati in Pikland, be&s;towed names perhaps even on large tracts, which pa&s;&s;ed into charters, and among the people.</ITEM>
</LIST></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I have with great care looked over the large At|las of Scotland, by Pont, and find the above re|marks univer&s;ally applicable, and &s;ufficient to ac|count for all the names in Scotland. It is indeed curious to ob&s;erve that in Aberdeen&s;hire, for in|&s;tance, the name of one village &s;hall be ab&s;olute Gothic with <HI>burgh,</HI> another within a mile with <HI>aber,</HI> and another at &s;ame di&s;tance <HI>inver.</HI> But the &s;ingle circum&s;tance of the clergy among the Piks being down to the eleventh or twelfth century en|tirely Welch and Iri&s;h, will &s;ufficiently account for this; if the <HI>abers</HI> and <HI>invers</HI> be indeed Welch and Iri&s;h.</P>
<P><HI>Kils</HI> are al&s;o common in Scotland; but the word in Gothic &s;ignifies a <HI>&s;pring,</HI> or <HI>fountain,</HI> as in Iri&s;h it implies a <HI>cell,</HI> or <HI>chapel,</HI> &s;o that nothing can be founded on &s;uch names which are al&s;o common in England. <HI>Cars</HI> as <HI>Carberry,</HI> &amp;c. have &s;eldom if ever any connexion with the Welch <HI>Caer,</HI> a town, as they are frequent over all the globe. In Wales <HI>Llan</HI> is very frequent, &s;ignifying a <HI>church;</HI> and in Scotland it al&s;o occurs, tho rarely: one in&s;tance there is &s;o far north as Moray, where <HI>Lan-bride</HI> &s;urely implies the church of St. Bride, or Bridget, and it mu&s;t have been founded by &s;ome Welch clergyman. For as at fir&s;t Ninian, Kentigern, and other early teachers of the Piks, were Welch; &s;o in aftertimes the regions of Strat-Clyde and Cum|bria proceeded, in conjunction with Columba's &s;e|minary at Hyona, to furni&s;h clergy to the Piks; and not one name of a Piki&s;h &s;aint, or churchman, can be found.</P>
<P>He that would build any argument upon the Welch names in Scotland is de&s;ired to reflect that the names of places in Scotland may be about
<PB N="157" REF="244">twelve thou&s;and; and of them not above thirty at the mo&s;t even &s;eem Welch. On the north, ea&s;t, and &s;outh, not above fifty are Iri&s;h; while on the we&s;t about two thou&s;and are Gothic; and the Gothic names in Scotland amount in all to about Ten Thou&s;and. As for the Iri&s;h interpretations of the&s;e Gothic names, which any highland &s;eer is ready to furni&s;h, &s;uck as that a plain Engli&s;h name <HI>Arthur's &s;eat</HI> is formed of three or four Er&s;e words, &amp;c it &s;eems doubtful whether they who advance &s;uch non&s;en&s;e, or they who believe it, have mo&s;t imbecillity. The&s;e Iri&s;h etymologies are mere &s;econd &s;ighted delu&s;ions. Swift's mock etymolo|gies of <HI>Andromache</HI> from <HI>Andrew Mackie,</HI> &amp;c. are rational in compari&s;on of them. Were a Chine&s;e or Otaheitan to a&s;k one of the&s;e Celtic dreamers the meaning of any name in his re&s;pective coun|try, the &s;eer would tell him it was Gaelic, and all about it. The Celtic is &s;o &s;oft, unfixt, and non|&s;en&s;ical a &s;peech, that from it you may make what you will of any thing. Thus the Iri&s;h word pro|nounced <HI>awe,</HI> for in&s;tance, and &s;ignifying <HI>law,</HI> is &s;pelt <HI>Adh, agh, ach, ath,</HI> at plea&s;ure. In other tongues a vowel is &s;ometimes changed; but the con&s;onants, which give a determinate form to the word, remain. What reliance can by any man of &s;en&s;e be placed on the meaning of names, when no one knows from what cau&s;e of ten thou&s;and the name was given, or whether from any at all? What reliance, when a name will, in two cen|turies, totally alter it's form? What reliance, above all, on etymologies from the Celtic, a &s;peech which alters it's con&s;onants, it's very e&s;&s;ence, at plea&s;ure, and which declines it's nouns by chang|ing their beginnings? The&s;e Celtic dreamers commonly catch at &s;ome locality, or de&s;criptive attribute, which fits the &s;pot, and then cook their etymologies accordingly. This gives them a plau|&s;ible air to the &s;uperficial, who never reflect that any &s;pot may have a hundred de&s;criptive attributes
<PB N="158" REF="245">all equally fitting. M. Bullet, in his <HI>Memoires &s;ur la langue Celtique,</HI> has derived the plaine&s;t Engli&s;h names from the Celtic, as <HI>Oakland</HI> from <HI>Oc,</HI> a little hill, <HI>lan</HI> a river, <HI>d</HI> from <HI>dy,</HI> two, &amp;c. &amp;c. Is not this lunacy? But &s;uch are all Celtic etymologies; and when a man of &s;cience erred &s;o gro&s;sly, what mu&s;t we expect from our &s;hallow highland dablers? Let us for ever leave tho&s;e &s;econd &s;ighted &s;eers to enjoy their own mad|ne&s;s; and, as madne&s;s is &s;aid to be catching, let us keep them at a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Even in Gothic, a fixt &s;peech, a &s;en&s;ible writer will hardly venture to hint at the etymology of a name now and then; for nothing can be more un|certain. <HI>London</HI> means, we are told, a town in a grove, from <HI>Lund</HI> grove, and <HI>dun</HI> town: yet the name might with equal plau&s;ibility be derived from Sarmatic, Tartaric, Chine&s;e, or Arabic. What do we know about the origin of the name? Who was pre&s;ent when the name was given? Do even the Indians know the meaning of their names of places, tho certainly impo&s;ed by their ance&s;tors in the &s;ame language they &s;till u&s;e, tho modernized? Are not names often mere jumbles of letters? A few Greek and Roman names of men had, and have, meanings; but produce, if you can, two names of places in Greece, or Italy, who&s;e mean|ing is known. What is the meaning of Rome? What of Athens? What of Lacedaemon? What of Corinth? Look into the be&s;t Lexicons, are you not told that &s;uch are proper names, and admit of no explanation? A&s;k an Indian &s;avage the meaning of the name of his town, he will tell you he knows it not; it was &s;o called by his fathers. Are our Celtic etymologi&s;ts of names of places more wi&s;e than the Greeks and Romans? Are they not more fooli&s;h than the Indians? Did ever any Indian en|joy the &s;econd &s;ight? Mu&s;t not our Celtic neigh|bours have a remarkable defect in their under|&s;tandings, and be lo&s;t in the frenzy of di&s;ordered
<PB N="159" REF="246">fancy? What &s;hall we &s;ay of tho&s;e who tru&s;t them in points of &s;cience, when they cannot even be tru&s;ted in points of common &s;en&s;e?</P>
<P>I have dwelt a little on this matter becau&s;e Celtic etymology is the frenzy of this &s;hallow age. And &s;hall only ob&s;erve, before quitting it, that by Gothic names i mean &s;uch who&s;e form is Gothic, and may be traced in the Northern kingdoms, Ger|many and England. I have above produced a &s;mall ha&s;ty note of identic names in the Northern kingdoms and in Scotland. And tho the pre&s;ent Engli&s;h certainly came from Denmark, and the German &s;hore; yet i cannot trace half that num|ber of identic names in tho&s;e countries and England. In Ireland mo&s;t of the towns were built by the Danes and Engli&s;h; but names of villages are often Iri&s;h, and in Wales mo&s;t towns and villages have Welch names, &s;o that Celtic names of towns have &s;ure marks. For examples of what i call Gothic names in Scotland, take on the we&s;t <HI>Dun|&s;on, Campbeltoun, Southend, Knapdale, Melford, Braccadale, Stornaway, Bewi&s;dale, Annon, Dun|&s;taffnage, Skipne&s;s, Pluckhart, Everdale, King&s;burgh, Burg, Seaforth, Dundonald, Dunvegan, Lime&s;holder, Barvie, Stonfield,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>From all that has been &s;aid the reader will ob|&s;erve, that they, who infer the Piks to have been Welch, becau&s;e thirty Welch names, or at lea&s;t names in <HI>Aber</HI> and <HI>Lan,</HI> occur in Scotland, rea&s;on not more accurately than he who would prove the Germans Welch, becau&s;e names in <HI>Aber</HI> and <HI>Lan</HI> occur in Germany. That the argument is in it&s;elf ab&s;olute Celtic and childi&s;h; for that grant|ing the&s;e thirty names Welch, what is to be &s;aid to the ten thou&s;and Gothic names in Scotland, which by this truly Celtic ratiocination are utterly forgotten? And that the&s;e few Welch names in Scotland are mo&s;t ea&s;ily accounted for, becau&s;e they are either very ancient; as tho&s;e of rivers and mountains e&s;pecially, and perhaps of &s;ome towns,
<PB N="160" REF="247" MS="Y">and in that ca&s;e remains of the old Celtic inhabi|tants; or le&s;s ancient as &s;ome of towns and villages which aro&s;e from churches founded by Welch clergymen.</P>
<P>Having thus, it is hoped, &s;atisfactorily an|&s;wered the whole arguments, if they de&s;erve that name, for the Piks being Welch, i &s;hall give the reader an ab&s;tract of invincible authorities and facts, &s;hewing that they were not Welch: and then, leaving this &s;trange controver&s;y, proceed to detail the real origin of the Piks.</P>
<P N="1">1. Tacitus &s;ays that the Caledonians, or Piks, were of Germany, as he judged from their red hair, and other marks, that they were Germans. The Scandinavians ever have been, and are, re|markable for red hair, as are the other Germans. The Welch and Iri&s;h are a black-haired race. The&s;e marks in the days of Tacitus were as deci|&s;ive, as that the African blacks have curled hair, the American lank hair.</P>
<P N="2">2. Eumenius tells, that in the time of Julius Cae&s;ar the Piks were the accu&s;tomed enemies of the Britons. Could the Britons, or Welch, be the accu&s;tomed enemies of them&s;elves?</P>
<P N="3">3. Ammianus Marcellinus mentions the Piks along with the Saxons, and other foreign nations, who infe&s;ted the Britons.</P>
<P N="4">4 Gildas &s;ays the Piks came <HI>ab aquilone,</HI> from the north, to infe&s;t the Britons, and always &s;peaks of them as quite a different people. Had they been really of his own Welch countrymen, what food for declamations had their cruelty to their own brethren been!</P>
<P N="5">5. Adomnan, who about 690, wrote the life of Columba, the apo&s;tle of the Piks, mentions that he had an interpreter between him and that people<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Illo in tempore quo Sanctus Columba in Pictorum pro|vincia per aliquot demorabatur dies, quidam cum tota ple|beius familia verbum vitae, per interpretatorem, Sancto prae|dicante viro audiens credidit, &amp;c. <HI>Adomnan. Vita Columbae,</HI> lib. II. c. 12. In the &s;ame chapter Adomnan calls the Piks 'gentiles barbari,' <HI>barbarous pagans;</HI> and always implies them quite a different people from his own Iri&s;h, in &s;peech, man|ners, and every re&s;pect.</NOTE>
<PB N="161" REF="248" MS="Y">Columba was an Iri&s;hman, &s;o that the Piks could not be Gael: and even from this they would &s;eem not Cumri, for we find Patrick a Cumraig preached to the Iri&s;h, without an interpreter, as may be &s;een in the many large lives of him, where not a word of an interpreter is mentioned.</P>
<P N="6">6. Beda, a writer eminently learned and &s;upe|rior to his age, tells us the Piks came from Scy|thia, as the Britons from Gaul, and the Old Scots from Ireland. Jornandes, and mo&s;t writers of the dark ages, call Scandinavia Scythia, and they thought the mo&s;t ancient Scythians came from it. Beda al&s;o &s;ays there were in his time Five languages in Britain, Latin, Engli&s;h, Piki&s;h, Scoti&s;h, Bri|ti&s;h.</P>
<P N="7">7. Nennius and Samuel, who both lived and wrote in conjunction, in 858, tell that the Piks came from the Orkneys, about 300 years before Chri&s;t. The&s;e writers were both Welch; and their te&s;timony is conclu&s;ive that the Piks were not Welch, for they &s;peak of the Piks, while the Piki&s;h name was in full power; and mention the Piks as a people &s;preading, in their own time, from Galloway to the Orkneys.</P>
<P N="8">8. The Saxon Chronicle, and whole writers of England, and Wales, and Scotland, and Ireland, preceding Camden, amounting to perhaps a hun|dred of all ages, who mention the Piks, uniformly derive them from Scandinavia and the Orkneys.</P>
<P N="9">9. Giraldus Cambren&s;is expre&s;&s;ly calls the Piks <HI>gentem Gothicam,</HI> a Gothic nation. Even Geofrey of Monmouth &s;ays expre&s;&s;ly, that the Piks came from Scythia to the north of Britain, and &s;o down|ward. And he ever de&s;cribes them as quite a dif|ferent people from the Welch; for which rea&s;on,
<PB N="162" REF="249">and as he founded a new &s;chool in Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, he is quoted. For, tho a &s;tupid romancer, he could not be ignorant if the Piks were Welch, or not, as they exi&s;ted in his time, under their old name, as appears from Engli&s;h writers of the War of the Standard.</P>
<P N="10">10. The Piks are uniformly mentioned by all ancient writers who &s;peak of them, tho without telling their origin, as a di&s;tinct peculiar people, neither Welch, nor Iri&s;h, nor Gaelic; but as dif|ferent from either, as Engli&s;h from Welch.</P>
<P N="11">11. The monuments of the Piks, the <HI>Piks hou&s;es,</HI> &amp;c. can neither be found in Wales nor Ireland; tho in the Orkneys many exi&s;t, and &s;ome in Scandinavia.</P>
<P N="12">12. Nennius and Samuel avouch the Piks to have held their u&s;ual territory in 858. The Iri&s;h annals of Tighernac and Ul&s;ter mention Kenneth and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, down to Donal II. 894, as kings of the Piks. Ailred, Richard of Hexham, and other cotemporary writers, mention, that at the war of the Standard, 1138, the Piks claimed the fir&s;t place in the Scoti&s;h army, as their ancient right. Now the we&s;t being given to the Iri&s;h, the Piks were laterly inhabitants of the north, ea&s;t, and &s;outh, of Scotland, as all know; the people of which, to this day, are quite a di&s;tinct race from the highlanders of the we&s;t. And the language of the&s;e parts was always Gothic, as innumerable names of places remain to &s;hew; and as it is at this day.</P>
<P>More arguments might be adduced; but the&s;e are &s;ufficient, as they admit of no an&s;wer, &s;ave by rejecting all ancient authorities and facts, that is by building romance on the ruins of hi&s;tory. For he who denies ancient authorities, and prefers his own &s;hallow dreams, is a fabuli&s;t, and not an hi&s;|torian. It al&s;o de&s;erves remark that, of modern authors, tho&s;e confe&s;&s;edly the mo&s;t eminent for learning have always a&s;&s;erted the Piks to have
<PB N="163" REF="250" MS="Y">come from Scandinavia. Buchanan, Humphrey Lluyd, Ver&s;tegan, U&s;her, Stillingfleet, Sibbald, Sheringham, may be named, at a time when Cam|den alone was on the other &s;ide: but in this &s;uper|ficial century, when writers copy each other, and examine nothing to the bottom, the opinion that the Piks were Welch, tho as above &s;hewn ab&s;o|lutely fal&s;e, ignorant, and childi&s;h, has been more prevalent. Yet in this age the truth has al&s;o witne&s;&s;es in D'Anville, and the authors of the Encyclopedie. Nor can the a&s;&s;ertors of the new opinion be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed without the cen&s;ure which the learned Sheringham pa&s;&s;es on &s;uch dreamers of dreams, <HI>temerarii, et vix &s;ani hominis, e&s;t, quidvis ex libidine affirmare, vel negare; et &s;ine firma ra|tione &s;criptoribus fidem demere;</HI> "it is the part of a ra&s;h madman to affirm or deny whatever he plea&s;es, and without any rea&s;on to refu&s;e faith to autho|rities."</P>

<P>THE antiquities of a nation may be regarded as either <HI>Poetical,</HI> or <HI>Hi&s;torical.</HI> The for|mer are &s;uch as have not that certainty requi&s;ite to hi&s;tory, yet cannot be called ab&s;olutely fal&s;e, but have veri&s;imilitude &s;ufficient to recommend them to poetry, which delights in di&s;tant events, where it can rai&s;e a fairy light in the dark. The voyage of Eneas to Italy, the founding of Carthage by Dido, and the like very remote events in national &s;tory, are of this kind; as no &s;ober author will admit them into hi&s;tory, and yet they appear to advan|tage in poetry. In like manner the origin of the Piks admits of a poetical, and an hi&s;torical, divi|&s;ion. The Poetical is that which traces them from Colchis to Scandinavia: the Hi&s;torical finds them in Norway, and traces them from Norway to Scotland. The reader is reque&s;ted to attend to this divi&s;ion, that he may not accu&s;e the author of lending <HI>hi&s;torical</HI> faith to <HI>poetical</HI> evidence; but judge impartially and give the poetical part only poetical faith. It is fully &s;ufficient, that we find the Piks in Norway, and trace them to Scotland. Hi&s;tory requires no more. But as this work may &s;erve the future poetry, as well as hi&s;tory of Scot|land, and it is plea&s;ing to &s;earch a point of anti|quity to the very bottom, no further apology &s;hall be made for dwelling a little on the Poetical Origin of the Piks.</P>

<P>If the reader will peru&s;e the Di&s;&s;ertation on the Origin and Progre&s;s of the Scythians, or Goths, to be found at the end of this work, he will &s;ee &s;uch grounds as &s;o remote an event can afford to believe that the <HI>Peukini,</HI> who by all accounts proceeded from the ile of <HI>Peuk&eacute;</HI> at the mouth of the Danube, were originally the <HI>Piki</HI> of ancient Colchis. The&s;e Piki Pliny places between the Palus Maeotis and Cerau|nian mountains. The Ceraunian Mountains, as appears from Ptolemy and others, were between the river Tanais, or Don, and the Ca&s;pian &s;ea, to the north-ea&s;t of Cauca&s;us, which was another chain extending from the Euxine to the Ca&s;pian. The Piki were apparently where the map of Sar|matia and Scythia, by Cluverius, places the <HI>Peti|gori</HI> on the river Varadanus, being on the ea&s;t of pre&s;ent Circa&s;&s;ia. The&s;e Piki were remarkable in ancient fable. Nonnus<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Diony&s;. II. 641.</NOTE> tells us, that they were the &s;ame people who were called <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Griffons, by the Greeks, and again&s;t whom the Arima&s;pi fought to get the guarded gold:</P>
<Q><L>As when a gryfon thro the wilderne&s;s,</L>
<L>With winged cour&s;e, o'er hill or moory dale,</L>
<L>Per&s;ues the Arima&s;pian, who by &s;tealth</L>
<L>Had from his wakeful cu&s;tody purloined</L>
<L>The guarded gold.</L>
<BIBL>Milt. Par. Lo&s;t, II. 943.</BIBL></Q>
<P>M. D'Hancarville thinks they were called Griffons, becau&s;e they wor&s;hiped the &s;un, who&s;e emblem was a griffon, as appears from many coins of Abdera, a city of Thrace. However this be, Plautus celebrates the golden mountains of the Piki:</P>

<L>Ego &s;olus &s;upero.</L>

<P>Upon the Argonautic expedition, 1263 years before Chri&s;t, a party of Colchians per&s;uing the
<PB N="166" REF="253">Argonauts without &s;ucce&s;s, &s;ettled at the mouth of the Danube. The kingdom of Colchis was an|ciently very large and powerful, as appears from all the ancients, who mention it, and included many nations. Of the&s;e it is highly probable the Piki were one; and were tho&s;e Colchian &s;ubjects who were &s;ent in per&s;uit of the Argonauts. Ovid, who lived nine years in exile at Tomi, &s;outhward of the Danube's mouth, marks the Colchi as &s;epa|rated from his re&s;idence by the Danube:</P>
<Q><L>Solus ad egre&s;&s;us mi&s;&s;us &s;eptemplicis I&s;tri</L>
<L>Parrha&s;iae gelido virginis axe premor.</L>

<L>Danubii mediis vix prohibentur aquis.</L>
<BIBL><HI>Tri&s;t.</HI> lib. II el. I.</BIBL></Q>
<P>The Jazyges were a Sarmatian people on the northern banks of the Tyras: Meterea was a town on the Tyras: the Getae were on the north of the Danube: the Colchi here mentioned were in all appearance of Peuk&eacute;, a large iland in the mouth of the Danube. The original Colchians were on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore of the Euxine, and had no con|cern with the Danube. It is true that Apollonius Rhodius, in his admirable Poem, &s;ays that the I&s;tri|ans on the Adriatic &s;ea were tho&s;e Colchians who per&s;ued the Argonauts; but his account is an ab|&s;olute impo&s;&s;ibility, for he tells that the Colchians &s;ailed all up the Danube, in per&s;uit of the Argo|nauts, and drew their &s;hips overland to &s;ettle in pre&s;ent I&s;tria. It &s;eems apparent that there was a people at the mouth of the Danube, or I&s;ter, called I&s;trii, and that the&s;e, being expelled by the Col|chians, went and &s;ettled on the Adriatic; while the Colchians, who held their old &s;eats, were, by a confu&s;ion in&s;eparable from tradition, mi&s;taken by &s;ome for the old inhabitants. Ovid, who lived on the &s;pot, is a clear evidence of a Colchian colony on the north of the Danube; for the I&s;trii he could not allude to, as they were a thou&s;and
<PB N="167" REF="254">miles di&s;tant, and on the &s;outh of the Danube, while all the other nations he mentions were near him, and on the north. If the Piki were the real ance&s;tors of the Peukini, and &s;ettled in Peuk&eacute; 1263 years before Chri&s;t, they might ea&s;ily in the cour&s;e of le&s;s than &s;even, hundred years populate the &s;pace between Peuk&eacute; and the Baltic; and pa&s;&s;ing the Baltic po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;outh of Scandinavia more than 500 years before Chri&s;t; a period about which it would appear, as mentioned in the above quoted Di&s;&s;ertation, that their Scythic brethren had peopled all Germany to the Briti&s;h &s;ea. If this <HI>poetical</HI> hypothe&s;is be followed, the whole Ba&s;|ternae (Peukini, Sitones, and Atmoni) mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to originate from Peuk&eacute;; as in|deed Peukini and Ba&s;ternae are &s;ynonymous names with Pliny and Tacitus.</P>
<P>But the <HI>poet</HI> who chu&s;es to commence the Piki&s;h origin only at the ile of Peuk&eacute;, will approach nearer to hi&s;tory, tho he will not be the be&s;t &s;killed in his own art. The Peukini can indeed be traced with geographic certainty from Peuk&eacute; into Scandinavia, as expre&s;&s;ly &s;hewn in the Di&s;&s;ertation annexed. The reader will there &s;ee that part of the Peukini &s;till remained in Peuk&eacute; and Thrace, in the time of Strabo; that from thence they can be traced, from Tacitus and Ptolemy, up to the &s;hore of the Baltic in pre&s;ent Pru&s;&s;ia. That the Sitones, another Ba&s;ternic nation, or (if we follow Pliny and Tacitus, and allow the Peukini and Ba&s;ternae &s;ynonymous terms) a nation of the Peu|kini, were in Scandinavia in the time of Tacitus. And that if, in oppo&s;ition to Pliny and Tacitus, we hold the Peukini to be only a nation of the Ba&s;|ternae, they lay nearer to the Baltic than the Si|tones, and proceeded, as appears from Ptolemy, in a direct line; while the Sitones moved round by the we&s;t &s;ide of the Vi&s;tula: &s;o that the Peukini, as they can be traced to the &s;hore of the Baltic, while a part of the Sitones held the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t
<PB N="168" REF="255">of Scandinavia, had in every probability &s;ent a colony into Scandinavia, before the Sitones, which proceeding north-we&s;t was lo&s;t to the eyes of the ancients, by whom no part of Scandinavia was known, &s;ave the &s;outhern &s;hores. It is al&s;o &s;hewn from Strabo, that the Ba&s;ternae held Scan|dinavia; and that, if we refu&s;e Ba&s;ternae and Peu|kini to be &s;ynonymous, it were yet unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that the Peukini, the greate&s;t nation of the Ba&s;ternae, and who can actually be traced to the very oppo&s;ite &s;hore, had no part in the&s;e &s;ettlements. But having dwelt &s;o fully on this &s;ubject in that Di&s;|&s;ertation, and produced the proofs in order, it is unnece&s;&s;ary here to recapitulate more, &s;eeing that it is &s;ufficient for the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e to trace the Piks in that part of Scandinavia now called Norway; and thence to Scotland.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>&sect; II.</HI> Hi&s;torical Origin of the Piks.</HEAD>
<P>Tacitus, the fir&s;t writer who mentions the people of Caledonia, or Piks, expre&s;&s;es his opinion that they were of German origin. Beda tells us they came from Scythia, a name which Jornandes about 530 had given to Scandinavia; and which continued to be applied to that country till the eleventh century, when the &s;pecial denominations of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, became known to Europe. All the other ancient writers who mention the origin of the Piks derive them from Scandinavia, &s;o that no doubt can remain, &s;ave with &s;uck &s;hallow dreamers as &s;peak of opinions when they &s;hould &s;peak of facts, and prefer their own weak conceits to that po&s;itive evidence upon which alone all ancient hi&s;tory &s;tands. Indeed, to judge from rea&s;on only, it might readily be inferred that the Piks, a people, as all the ancients &s;hew, quite different from the old Scots, or Iri&s;h, and from the old Britons, or Welch, as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing North Britain, could only originate from a country near to
<PB N="169" REF="256" MS="Y">North Britain, as Norway is. And when rea&s;on and ancient authorities thus coale&s;ce, they con&s;titute that highe&s;t degree of Hi&s;torical Truth which even approaches to Mathematical Demon&s;tration. In Scandinavia therefore, that large penin&s;ular tract, including Norway, Sweden, and a part of Den|mark, we are to look for the Piks: and while we find a people of the &s;ame name, in the &s;outh of Norway, the part next to Scotland, the evi|dence becomes as complete as human hi&s;tory can afford.</P>
<P>Scandinavia was by the Romans, who only knew a &s;mall part of it's &s;outhern coa&s;ts, e&s;teemed not improperly a German iland. It is indeed more properly a va&s;t iland, than a penin&s;ula; as it's extent is &s;o great, and the part that connects it with the continent &s;o narrow. For all the South, We&s;t, and North, quarters are &s;urrounded with &s;ea; and on the Ea&s;t the lakes Ladoga and Onega are con|nected by large rivers, or rather outlets: and between the lake Onega and the White Sea, being the only part where there is a pa&s;&s;age into Scan|dinavia by land, there is another lake and river rendering that &s;ingle pa&s;&s;age not above two miles broad. The circumference of Scandinavia is about Two Thou&s;and Two Hundred miles; and of that whole circumference only two miles being land, it &s;eems rather an impropriety to call it a penin&s;ula, than objectionable to term it an iland. Tacitus ranks the Sitones a people of Scandinavia among the Germans; and the other ancients ac|count it an iland of Germany, and it's inhabitants Germans.</P>
<P>This va&s;t iland &s;eems to have been fir&s;t peopled by Fins and Laplanders, whom Ihre thinks the fir&s;t inhabitants of the whole. But there is great rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that the&s;e people, being from the ea&s;t, had not extended further we&s;t than their pre&s;ent bounds, when they were &s;topt by the Scy|thians, or Goths, from the &s;outh. For there are
<PB N="170" REF="257" MS="Y">no Finni&s;h or Laplandic names in Sweden, or in Norway, tho, had &s;uch been given to rivers, or mountains, they mu&s;t have in &s;ome ca&s;es re|mained. The Finni&s;h and Laplandic names are very peculiar, and di&s;tinct from the Gothic: al|mo&s;t all end in <HI>vi</HI> or <HI>o;</HI> and they are generally &s;oft as the Italian. Nor in the Eddas, or ancient Sagas, is there a hint of any conflicts with the Fins, or Laplanders, tho they inform that Odin conquered the Cimbri.</P>
<P>Mela, who wrote in the reign of Claudius about 45 years after Chri&s;t, &s;ays, book III. ch. 3. that the Cimbri and Teutones held the ilands in the <HI>Sinus Codanus,</HI> or Gulf between Jutland and Scan|dinavia. And ch. 6. he &s;ays there were &s;even ilands in that gulf, and that the Teutones &s;till had Codanovia, the large&s;t and be&s;t of the&s;e ilands. The&s;e &s;even ilands &s;eem Funen, Al&s;en, Longland, Laland, Fal&s;ter, Mone, Femeren. Funen, called Tutofunen in the map of Clu|verius, is by far the large&s;t and be&s;t of the&s;e, and is perhaps that meant by Mela. As to Zeeland, an iland equal in &s;ize to all the&s;e put together, it was called Scandia by Ptolemy and other ancients; and lyes beyond the&s;e &s;even ilands, &s;o that it &s;eems to have been unknown to Mela, and by no means to have been his Codanovia, as &s;ome think. Taci|tus, by &s;ome accident in his information, &s;eems to have known little of Jutland; for he &s;ays no|thing of the Cimbric Cher&s;one&s;e, nor Sinus Coda|nus, nor Teutoni; and only mentions in general the nations that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the large Cimbric Cher|&s;one&s;e, tho without marking it by that name.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, the Cimbri anciently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Jutland; and the Teutones the ilands between it and Scandinavia. But that the Cimbri, or Teu|tones, ever were in Scandinavia it&s;elf, there is not a &s;hadow of proof. Pliny, the fir&s;t writer who mentions Scandinavia, &s;ays it was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Hilleviones. The Ba&s;ternae, tho&s;e Germans, or
<PB N="171" REF="258">Goths, who peopled Scandinavia, entering on the &s;outh-ea&s;t, proceeded north and we&s;t; and &s;eem, &s;ome centuries after they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Scandinavia, to have made expeditions again&s;t the Cimbri and Teutones, who were on the &s;outhern &s;hores op|po&s;ite to them. The&s;e nations, being unable to with&s;tand their invaders, were forced to relinqui&s;h their territories to them. Being al&s;o &s;urrounded with other Germans, or Goths, on the &s;outh, they &s;eem to have obtained leave to pa&s;s thro the ter|ritories of the later, in que&s;t of new inhabitants, which, as Cae&s;ar<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">See the example of the Helvetii. <HI>De Bell.

This the &s;outhern Goths would readily grant, as every motive of policy and intere&s;t mu&s;t have in|duced them. The Cimbri and Teutones fir&s;t came to the territories of the Belgae, who, as Cae&s;ar tells<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Lib. II.</NOTE>, repul&s;ed them. But turning to the ea&s;t of the Belgae, where lay the fore&s;t of Arduenna, and tracts of de&s;art land, the Cimbri and Teutones bur&s;t upon Celtic Gaul.

The Cimbri and Teutones, had they &s;eized all Celtic Gaul, could not, one would imagine, want new ha|bitations; yet the&s;e were all they required from the Romans, as we know from hi&s;tory<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Plutarch in Mario, &amp;c.</NOTE>. It is impo&s;|&s;ible to account for the ideas of the&s;e barbarians. Had they wanted wa&s;te grounds to cultivate, they might have found them in the fore&s;t of Arduenna. Had they wanted to po&s;&s;e&s;s cultivated lands, they
<PB N="172" REF="259" MS="Y">had them in Celtic Gaul, and the province. Yet they abandon all to march into Italy. Plutarch al&s;o informs, that they invaded Spain before turn|ing upon Italy. So far as can be judged, the Cim|bri and Teutones, finding the &s;weets of a roving and plundering life, preferred it to any &s;ettlement; and, being unu&s;ed to agriculture in their fir&s;t &s;eats, con&s;idered cultivated lands only with a view of pillage. Their demand of lands from the Ro|mans &s;eems to have been a mere pretence: rapine and plunder their &s;ole pur&s;uits. Like the Huns afterward, they &s;ettled nowhere, but followed war as a trade. Many of the German nations were agricultural, as Tacitus &s;hews; and Cae&s;ar tells that the Belgae of Britain were di&s;tingui&s;hed from the indigenes, or Celts, by agriculture. The Celts being indeed mere &s;avages, and wor&s;e than the &s;avages of America, are remarkable even to our own times for a total neglect of agriculture them&s;elves, and for plundering their neighbours. The Iri&s;h Celts, Scoti&s;h Celts, and Welch Celts, have all a like claim to this character; and when it begins to pa&s;s away, it is only a &s;ign that by intermarriages the Gothic blood begins to exceed the Celtic: and that the Celts are no longer Celts, tho &s;o accounted. Plutarch &s;ays the Germans called banditti, <HI>Cimbri.</HI> For the Gothic agricul|tors naturally gave this epithet to their Celtic neighbours who preyed upon their labours: as the highlanders, and Iri&s;h Celts, are called <HI>Caterens, Kerns,</HI> or <HI>thieves.</HI></P>
<P>That the &s;hock which drove the Cimbri and Teutones out of the north of Germany mu&s;t have come from the north of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions is clear; for, had it proceeded from the &s;outh, they mu&s;t have been driven into Scandinavia. In other words, the Scandinavians mu&s;t have expelled the Cimbri and Teutones; and it is rea&s;onable to in|fer of cour&s;e that they &s;eized their &s;eats. Hence it appears to me, that Jutland, and the Dani&s;h
<PB N="173" REF="260" MS="Y">iles, were peopled with Goths from Scandinavia, and not from Germany. This opinion &s;eems con|firmed by that &s;ure&s;t mark, the &s;peech of the&s;e parts; which is not the German dialect of the Gothic, but the Scandinavian dialect of that tongue; and this di&s;tinction between Germany and the Dani&s;h dominion has always been marked and preci&s;e. The nations which Tacitus finds in pre|&s;ent Jutland, namely the Angli, Varini, Eudo&s;es, Suardones, and Nuithones, and the Suiones of Zeeland, will of cour&s;e be originally Scandina|vians. Ptolemy names the nations in pre&s;ent Jut|land, Sigulones, Sabelengii, Cobandi, Chali, Phundu&s;ii, Charudes; but his authority, compared to that, of Tacitus, who lived near the &s;pot, is as night to day; and not one name of his nations is to be found, &s;ave in his book, while the real names, as given by Tacitus, occur in many authors.

<P>The labial letters, and among others the <HI>P</HI> and are very apt to be interchanged in oral language. Hence the &s;ame people were called <HI>Pihtar,</HI> or Piks, more anciently and properly; and laterly Vihtve|riar, and by contraction, <HI>Vihtar,</HI> or Viks. The fir&s;t name was the mo&s;t ancient, tho even in Ammia|nus we find <HI>Vecturiones</HI> for Piks. Common names are indeed liable to perpetual corruption and abu&s;e. In Norway the real ancient name &s;eems to have been Pihtar, as we find it in the Saxon Chroni|cle; but afterward Vihtar, as in the Sagas, all of which are later than that Chronicle. Having pre|mi&s;ed the&s;e remarks let us proceed to illu&s;trate the ancient &s;eats of the Piks in Norway.</P>
<P>Torfaeus, the greate&s;t antiquary whom this cen|tury has produced, and de&s;erving of the highe&s;t prai&s;e, not only from his country, but from all Europe, has in the de&s;cription of Norway, which commences his large and valuable hi&s;tory of that country, given us many lights on <HI>Vika</HI> or <HI>Vichia,</HI> the ancient kingdom of the Piks, tho he has not
<PB N="174" REF="261" MS="Y">dropt one hint that it produced the Piks &s;o noted in Roman hi&s;tory. His re&s;earches, confined to Northern antiquities, have not &s;ugge&s;ted to him the lea&s;t idea of this; and i am forced to take upon my&s;elf the whole weight of this di&s;covery. Tor|faeus informs that the whole of that country in the &s;outh of Norway, which &s;urrounds the bay of Op&s;lo, or O&s;loa, or Chri&s;tiana, was anciently called VIKA, and it's ilands the VIKR iles. It comprehended the provinces of <HI>Raumarik, Rin|garik, Hadaland, Thotnia, Heidmarch,</HI> and <HI>Gud|brandzdal.</HI> This country is in modern maps called <HI>The Government of Agerhus,</HI> being about two hundred miles long, and one hundred broad. It is remarkable that it lyes on the ea&s;t, and not on the we&s;t of Norway, where one would naturally imagine that the government of Bergen, being the whole &s;outh-we&s;t part of Norway, and &s;tretching along the we&s;tern ocean, would have been the natural parent of tho&s;e Piks, who cro&s;&s;ed that &s;mall tract of that ocean which lyes between Nor|way and Scotland. But the&s;e affairs do not hap|pen in &s;uch formal order, el&s;e the Dutch, and not the Jutes, Saxons, and Angles, would have &s;eized England. It may however well be inferred, that, in times preceding any Sagas, or other memorials of Norwegian hi&s;tory, the whole Norwegians were called Pihtar, as being Peukini, tho afterward this name only remained to a great part; as Es-Sex, and Middle Sex, or Ea&s;t Saxony, and Middle Saxony, remain names of counties in England, tho not ex|ceeding a quarter of the ancient dominions of the Saxons in that country. Be this as it may, it is &s;uf|ficient that ancient Vika &s;tretched along that &s;ea, which is to the &s;outh of Norway, to the extent of about one hundred and fifty miles; for <HI>Vik-Siden,</HI> or the Vik Side &s;pred, even in the time of Torfaeus, down to Bahus on the ea&s;t. Here were 150 miles of &s;ea-coa&s;t open to the people of Vika, directly oppo&s;ite to the north of Scotland, and only about 240 miles from it.</P>
<PB N="175" REF="262">
<P>There are no Northern Sagas or Hi&s;tories ex|tant which can be called older than the eleventh century. Arius Frodi, the fir&s;t Hi&s;torian, is of the twelfth century: Snorro Sturle&s;on of the thir|teenth. Much ob&s;curity therefore hangs around the hi&s;tory of Norway till about the year 900, when Harald Harfagre, one of the petty kings of that country, conquering ten or twelve others, aro&s;e monarch of all Norway. Among the con|quered kingdoms Vika is expre&s;sly mentioned by Torfaeus, II. 18. But the inland parts of this large country had been &s;plit into three or four kingdoms, Rauma-rik, Ringa-rik, Heidmark, &amp;c. all of which occur often in Torfaeus by the&s;e names, and under di&s;tinct kings; while the king|dom of Vika was confined to that part which lay along the &s;ea, as appears from many pa&s;&s;ages of Torfaeus, and e&s;pecially frequent mention of in|vaders landing and ravaging the territories of Vika. And Olaus Magnus means this part, when he &s;ays, <HI>Vichia olim regnum:</HI> 'Vichia anciently a kingdom<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;toria (&s;hould be <HI>de&s;criprio</HI>) Gent.

<P>Such hints as can be found concerning Vika or Vichia in the Northern writers &s;hall here be thrown together. Torfaeus de&s;cribes <HI>Vik-Siden,</HI> a great part of the coa&s;t of ancient Vika yet retaining that name, as a beautiful country orna|mented with large plains, thick woods of fir, and moderate hills, that, &s;welling down to the &s;hore, are inter&s;ected with large and &s;mall creeks. The ancient inhabitants were of remarkable ferocity, and &s;crupled not to invade and ravage their neigh|bours. The river <HI>Gautelf</HI> runs thro this part of Vika; and forms a great cataract, under which, between the water and the rocks, banditti u&s;ed to lurk. In this part of Vika is al&s;o <HI>Konga-hilla,</HI> or Kings-hill, central to the dominions of Denmark,
<PB N="176" REF="263">Norway, and Sweden: and where the three kings u&s;ed to meet when a conference was appointed This country is fertile, and remarkable for ale of peculiar &s;trength. The &s;hore was anciently noted for it's herring fi&s;hery, but the &s;hoals have now abandoned it.

In the <HI>Nori Regnum</HI> of Ramus, being an hi&s;tory of Nor|way prior to Harald Harfagre, or 900, we find the following &s;tory concerning a king of Vika, which Ramus dates in the year of the world 3960, or about 40 years before Chri&s;t. But, according to the error of la&s;t century, the Northern authors placed events many ages too ancient; and Tor|faeus and Ramus have &s;hewn &s;o little judgment in this point, as to &s;uppo&s;e the events preceding our aera known, and tho&s;e for many centuries after unknown: of which Ramus, in this very book, affords a remarkable in&s;tance, for he narrates nu|merous matters prior to our aera, yet gravely, tells us, that for the fir&s;t 338 years after it nothing is known! Torfaeus had in like manner dated the reign of Hrolf Krak king of Denmark before our aera: till upon further examination of his &s;tory, finding adventures with a king of Nor|thumberland, and the like, he was forced to date
<PB N="177" REF="264">it 500 years after. But, in fact, there is no me|mory of Northern affairs preceding the year 500<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">See Di&s;&s;ertation annexed.</NOTE>; and this tale may be dated about the eighth cen|tury. Here it is. 'At that time died A&s;vid, &s;on of Alf king of Heidmarch. A&s;mund king of Vikia, the &s;on of Bero, wi&s;hing not to &s;urvive the death of his <HI>&s;worn brother,</HI> took with him &s;ome meat and drink, and went down into the &s;epulchre of A&s;vid, which was in a deep cavern.

A&s;mund, repenting of his re&s;olution, &s;eized the occa&s;ion, threw out the &s;oldier, and mounting the ba&s;ket him&s;elf, was drawn up by the Swedes. They being terrified out of mea&s;ure at this unexpected apparition, fled with great pre|cipitation, A&s;mund in vain trying to recall them.

<P>Ramus al&s;o mentions Alf king of Alfheim, or Vikia, who&s;e daughter Alfhilda Starcater, the Fingal of the North, carried off acid married. Torfaeus, in his hi&s;tory of Norway, is quite full
<PB N="178" REF="265" MS="Y">of Vika, as a country of Norway, and as bor|dering on the &s;outh &s;ea, the mo&s;t expo&s;ed to in|va&s;ions. But of it's kings i believe few other names are known than the two above mentioned. The whole hi&s;tory of Norway prior to 900, when Harold Harfagre, or fair-hair, became &s;o e king, is unknown, or bordering on romance. Vika being laterly but one of ten or twelve kingdoms in Norway, it's hi&s;tory has peri&s;hed, as that of the others; both by rea&s;on of the confu&s;ion in&s;e|parable from the mingled events of &s;uch &s;mall &s;tates, and becau&s;e that no writers aro&s;e till the twelfth century, long after the extinction of the&s;e &s;tates. Eric Blodox, &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Harald Harfagre 933, had at fir&s;t but half of Norway; Olaf, one of his brothers, u&s;urping Vika, and Sigrod, the other, Thrandia: but Eric entering Vika, engaged both his brothers, and &s;lew them. In 938 Torfaeus tells, that Haco king of Norway re&s;tored Thor&s;tein lord of Vika to his hereditary po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and in 942 Haco cleared Vika of Danes and pirates. About the year 1000, in the time of Harold Blaatand, we find &s;trong di&s;putes in Vika, whether the pagan or chri&s;tian religion fhould prevail. King Olaf Tryggvin, about 1025, converted all Vicha to chri&s;tianity. After this Vika is often mentioned, till the clo&s;e of the Norwegian hi&s;tory, in the fourteenth century, when it coale&s;ced with that of Denmark. The Vikar were a rebellious, people; and in particular the grand faction of the <HI>Baglar,</HI> &s;o prominent in the later hi&s;tory of Norway, con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of Vikar<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Torfaei Hi&s;t.

<P>In the Icelandic, or old Norwegian tongue, <HI>wik</HI> is a <HI>bay</HI> or <HI>haven,</HI> as &s;ome &s;ay; but, accord|ing to the Icelandic lexicon of Andreas, <HI>Vik</HI> is a <HI>promontory,</HI> or <HI>corner.</HI> Many towns in the North|ern kingdoms end in <HI>wic</HI> or <HI>vic,</HI> as <HI>Sandwic</HI> in
<PB N="179" REF="266" MS="Y">Norway, &amp;c. But this word cannot well, in either acceptation, be &s;uppo&s;ed to be the very name of VIKA, a territory 200 miles long and 100 broad; for how ab&s;urd an appellation would <HI>the Bay, the Haven, the Corner, the Promontory,</HI> be for &s;uch a country! Be&s;ide, the whole Northern writers call this country as often <HI>Vichia</HI> as <HI>Vika,</HI> and have never dropt a &s;ingle hint that this name was from <HI>vik.</HI> There is one kingdom in Europe which takes it's name from a haven, Portugal from Por|tus Calle; but this name is from a &s;pecial haven; and to have called it <HI>The Haven</HI> in general would have been &s;o ab&s;urd as never to have &s;truck the weake&s;t mind; for it would have been a name that was no name, but might apply to a thou&s;and other places. It therefore appears that VIK or VICH, the name of this kingdom, has no more connexion with <HI>vik</HI> 'a haven,' &amp;c. than any word has to do with another identically &s;o &s;pelled, but of a quite different import. We know what laughter Somner occa&s;ioned when he derived <HI>Cum|berland</HI> from people being <HI>cumbered</HI> in going over it's hills.

<P>From <HI>Vik,</HI> a haven, the word <HI>Vikingur,</HI> a pi|rate, &s;eems to be formed, tho Andreas derives it from <HI>Vig,</HI> a &s;hip.

<P>Before leaving this part of the &s;ubject, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the names VIK and VIKAR can be traced in Scandinavia &s;o as to &s;hew that it mu&s;t have been once much &s;pred.

<P>Now it is remarkable, that in the three fir&s;t of the&s;e colonies the name of the <HI>Vikar,</HI> the chief people of ancient Norway, occurs. The Piks bear it expre&s;&s;ly, with the mere change of a labial let|ter, which change was in the word <HI>Vikar,</HI> not in <HI>Pikar;</HI> for the Northern nations fond of clo&s;e and hard &s;ounds, as the cold climate renders their fi|bres rigid, and makes them &s;peak much thro the teeth, or with as clo&s;e lips as po&s;&s;ible, naturally preferred the clo&s;e <HI>V</HI> to the open <HI>P,</HI> and thus changed the ancient Pikar to Vikar.

For the province of <HI>Picardie,</HI> the derivation of who&s;e name has baffied all the French antiquaries, was the earlie&s;t &s;ettlement of the Nor|wegians
<PB N="183" REF="270">in France, who thence advanced to be|&s;iege Paris; and after acquired Normandie. But Picardie, being actually &s;eized and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by them for &s;ome time before they gained Normandie, it was not included in the grant of Normandie, becau&s;e already their's by full conque&s;t and po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion. Picardie is a province 48 leagues long, and 38 broad. It's rivers are la Somme, l'Oy&s;e, la Cauche, la Scarpe, la Lys, and l'Aa. The name of Picardie is unknown till the thirteenth century, when Guillaume de Naugis fir&s;t u&s;es it, as Matthew of Paris, under the year 1229, &s;peaks of the Pi|cards who border on Flanders. It was about 900 that Ganga Hrolf, or Rollo the Walker, (&s;o called, becau&s;e no hor&s;e could &s;upport his weighty &s;tature) a Norwegian Earl, who, as not di&s;hon|ourable in that age, practi&s;ed piracy, landed, and ravaged a part of Vika<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See a Di&s;&s;ertation on Rollo in Torf.

Harald Harfagre, the new monarch of all Norway, bani&s;hed Rollo who fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ed to the We&s;tern iles of Scotland; then invaded England, but without any &s;ucce&s;s; and at la&s;t went to Neu&s;tria, or pre&s;ent Nor|mandy, in France. After ravaging a great part of the north of France, and be&s;ieging Paris, at length in 912 a treaty was made, by which all Normandy was yielded to Rollo and his followers. Rollo lived to a great age, and left that province &s;ecure to his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors; one of whom was after to a&s;cend the throne of England. It was in 1205, that Normandy was reunited to France, by Philip Augu&s;tus: and it is remarkable that the name of Picardie begins fir&s;t to appear at this time. This &s;eems owing to the writers of Norman hi&s;tory being Frenchmen, and other foreigners, who u&s;ed a general name for the whole people; but when the French had gotten po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and complete know|lege of the country, they found that the inhabi|tants of the ea&s;tern part called them&s;elves Picars, and u&s;ed that denomination for them in cour&s;e.</P>

<P>Having thus di&s;played the &s;eats of the Piks in Scandinavia, it remains to trace them from thence to Scotland, which can be done with the utmo&s;t certainty that ancient hi&s;tory can bear.</P>
<P>Tacitus is the fir&s;t writer who mentions the Cale|donians, or Piks, in North Britain, and he gives his opinion that they came from Germany: and he includes the people of Scandinavia, the Suiones, and Sitones in Germany, &s;o that Scandinavia was a part of his Germany. His words are, in de|&s;cribing Britain, <HI>Ceterum Britanniam qui mortales initio coluerint, indigenae an advecti, ut inter Barbaros parum compertum. Habitus corporum varii, atque ex eo aygumenta.

"More|over what mortals fir&s;t inhabited Britain, indigenal or adventitious, is, as u&s;ual with barbarians, little known. The habits of their bodies are various, whence arguments may ri&s;e. For the red hair and large limbs of tho&s;e inhabiting Caledonia a&s;&s;ure us of their German origin. The tawny faces, and generally curled hair of the Silures, and their po&s;ition oppo&s;ite to Spain, make us believe that they are old Iberi who pa&s;&s;ed over, and occupied the&s;e &s;eats. Tho&s;e next to the Gauls re&s;emble the Gauls: whether becau&s;e the &s;trong feature of their origin continues, or that, their lands running out in diver&s;e directions, the po&s;ition of the climate gave a different habit to their bodies. Yet to one judging upon the whole it is credible that the Gauls occupied the part next them." This pa&s;&s;age is
<PB N="185" REF="272" MS="Y">entitled to a commentary. The red hair and large limbs are to this day the grand features of the Scandinavians, while the Scoti&s;h, Iri&s;h, and Welch Celts are remarkable for black hair, and a &s;ize rather diminutive. The Germans were equally re|markable for their red, yellow, and flaxen hair, which are all but different &s;hades of the &s;ame com|plexion. If my memory &s;erves, &s;ome of the Ro|man writers mention the yellow hair of the Gauls, meaning tho&s;e Gauls who bordered on Italy, tho&s;e of Gallia Bracata, Helvetia, &amp;c. up to Belgium, all of whom were real Germans, who had expelled the old Gauls to the we&s;t, or Celtic Gaul; and were called Gauls, as an Engli&s;hman is called a Briton. The marks here given by Tacitus, how|ever &s;light they may &s;eem now, are in fact ex|tremely &s;trong among &s;avages, as the Britons then were. The olive complexion and lank hair of an Ea&s;t Indian; the copper colour of an American; the &s;able face and wooly head of an African, are infallible badges now: and &s;o were the di&s;tinctions of the Britons in the time of Tacitus. The word ASSEVERANT, 'a&s;&s;ure,' u&s;ed by Tacitus with re|gard to the Caledonians being of German extract, is firm and invincible; for he had lived long among the Germans of Belgium, and if he did not attend Agricola to this country, he had an almo&s;t equal advantage of intimate and continual conver|&s;ation with him. As to another divi&s;ion of the Britons, namely the Silures, Tacitus is not &s;o clear. He &s;ays they might be of Spain, the cir|cum&s;tances <HI>fidem faciunt,</HI> <Q>make us believe, &startq;&endq;make it credible.</Q> Tacitus proceeds to mention that the Britons next Gaul re&s;embled the Gauls. That is, the Belgae of the &s;outh and ea&s;t re&s;embled the Belgic Gauls. And it al&s;o &s;triking him at the &s;ame time, that the Celtic Gauls oppo&s;ite to the inhabitants of the &s;outh-we&s;t of Britain re&s;embled them, as in fact the Celts do at this day, in &s;un|burnt faces, and curled hair, he adds, that upon
<PB N="186" REF="273">the whole it is credible that the Gauls occupied <HI>vicinum &s;olum,</HI> the land next them. That is, it was credible that the Silures might al&s;o be of Gallic origin, as they lay near Gaul. A critic or two, who have kindly explained Tacitus to others, without under&s;tanding him them&s;elves, have imagined that by the words <HI>in univer&s;um,</HI> "upon the whole," that great writer meaned flatly to con|tradict him&s;elf in the cour&s;e of two &s;entences; and to infer that all Britain was peopled from Gaul. <HI>In univer&s;um</HI> is a mere phra&s;e of tran&s;ition; and has perhaps been put by Tacitus with the &s;ame negligence, as he would have put <HI>Sed,</HI> or <HI>Et.</HI> He u&s;es the very identic phra&s;e when &s;peaking of the German armies, <HI>In univer&s;um ae&s;timanti plus penes peditem robur,</HI> "Upon the whole, the infan|try have more force." But as this implies not that all the German armies were of infantry, &s;o neither does the former imply that all the Britons were of Gaul. He expre&s;&s;ly adds <HI>vicinum &s;olum</HI> 'the neighbouring land,' which can never apply to Caledonia, a country 500 miles from Gaul; and the German origin of who&s;e people he &s;ays is SURE, <HI>a&s;&s;everant.</HI></P>
<P>The weapons of war u&s;ed by the Caledonians and Germans were al&s;o the &s;ame. Tacitus &s;hews that both u&s;ed long &s;words. In Annal. II. he gives long &s;pears to the Germans, a weapon remarkable in Scotland to the late&s;t times. Herodian, book III. &s;ays, the Caledonians had &s;hort and narrow &s;hields; and &s;o Tacitus of the Germans, Annal. III.</P>
<P>The next writers who mention the Caledonians, are Dio and Herodian, who &s;ay nothing of their origin; but mention their cu&s;tom of painting them&s;elves, a cu&s;tom, as above &s;hewn, unknown to the Celts, and an infallible badge of a Gothic nation: as were the Belgae of South Britain, who al&s;o retained it.</P>
<P>Eumenius and others, who mention the Piks, drop no hint of their origin. Claudian, who wrote about 390, alludes to it:</P>
<PB N="187" REF="274">
<Q><L>Maduerunt Saxone fu&s;o</L>
<L>Orcades. Incaluit Pictorum &s;anguine Thule.</L>

<P>The whole of this pa&s;&s;age alludes, to the victory obtained over the Saxons, Piks, and Scots, the ravagers of Britain, by the general Theodo&s;ius. Claudian u&s;es all the privilege of poetry, and &s;wells even to bomba&s;t, a not unu&s;ual fault of his. The Orcades, his deceitful and poetic memory
<Q><L>(For, where the &s;corching beams of fancy play,</L>

has confounded with the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> or Iles of the Saxons of Ptolemy, his countryman; which were above the mouth of the Elbe, and are now <HI>de Strand,</HI> and other iles, almo&s;t &s;wallowed up at the &s;outh-we&s;t extremity of Jutland, the real old &s;eat of the Saxons, as Ptolemy marks them. The&s;e iles were oppo&s;ite to the Orkneys, according to Ptolemy; and Claudian has from ignorance, or want of memory, confounded them. His ver&s;es evidently mean in bomba&s;tic prai&s;e to a&s;&s;ert, that Theodo&s;ius, not content with repelling the Saxons, Piks, and Scots, cha&s;ti&s;ed them all in their ori|ginal &s;eats, the Iles of the Saxons here ab&s;urdly called Orcades; Thule, or Scandinavia; and Ierne, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> as the Greek writers call it, or Ireland. That Scandinavia was the Thule of the later Ro|man writers is clear from Procopius. If with Clau|dian we a&s;&s;ert Saxons in the Orkneys, we mu&s;t prefer the language of fiction, to the &s;ober pro&s;e truth of all the ancients. Some, to &s;ave his error, &s;ay this mu&s;t have been a naval battle: but that this was impo&s;&s;ible will appear from the nar|rative of the expedition of Theodo&s;ius given us by Ammianus. But, not to found on poetry, let us leave this pa&s;&s;age, <HI>valeat quantum valere pote&s;t,</HI> and attend to plain pro&s;e.</P>
<P>Bella wrote in 731, and was an author of pro|digious learning and judgment for the time, as his
<PB N="188" REF="275" MS="Y">numerous works declare. His Eccle&s;ia&s;tic Hi&s;tory of the Engli&s;h nation, in five books, is the be&s;t of the&s;e works. Would that it had been the Civil hi&s;tory; and that with fifty pages of facts, we had not three hundred of miracles! Yet have we rea|&s;on to rejoice that the Chri&s;tian religion was then profe&s;t in Britain; as, without it, even the&s;e pre|cious fifty pages of facts might never have appeared. Tacitus has his miracles as well as Beda, and with|out his apology. Nor is the <HI>memorant qui interfuere,</HI> re&s;pecting the miracles of Ve&s;pa&s;ian, much le&s;s ri|&s;ible, than the <HI>vidimus</HI> of Iri&s;h books curing poi|&s;on, in Beda; who in that pa&s;&s;age perhaps &s;ilently quotes, a practice not unu&s;ual in the middle ages, for this &s;ingle word <HI>vidimus</HI> is the mo&s;t prominent of all Beda's book, who tells other miracles by hear&s;ay. Livy is al&s;o full of miracles, tho his judgment in other points has never been que&s;tioned, Beda's account of the origin of the Britons, Scots, and Angli, is unque&s;tionably ju&s;t, which makes us &s;ecure when he treats the Piki&s;h origin. The Britons, he &s;ays, came <HI>de tractu Armoricano.</HI> By the Britons, Beda always means the Welch; but the &s;ignification of his Armorica is not clear. The more common meaning of Armorica is Bre|tagne, and that the Welch did not come from that tract is certain. But the term Armorica was very lax; and &s;eems to have extended in it's real meaning of <HI>on the &s;ea,</HI> or <HI>&s;ea-&s;hore,</HI> along the whole coa&s;t of Gaul, even up to the Rhine. And that the Cimbri, or German Celts, pa&s;&s;ed into South Britain from Belgic Gaul, as the Belgae did long after, is mo&s;t probable. Beda &s;ays, book I. c. 21. that Germanus, bi&s;hop of Alti&s;iodorum, or Auxerre in Burgundy, went to Ravenna, <HI>pro pace Armoricanae gentis &s;upplicaturus,</HI> to &s;upplicate for the peace of Armorica.' Auxerre is quite remote from Bretagne, but is on the borders of Belgic Gaul. Beda's Armorica &s;eems to be French Flan|ders. After all, Beda is here &s;peaking of the fir&s;t
<PB N="189" REF="276">population of this iland, which was certainly by Gael, from Celtic Gaul, in which Armorica in it's u&s;ual acceptation of Bretagne lyes. Beda, not knowing that the Cimbri had driven tho&s;e Gael in|to Ireland, might, from the great remotene&s;s of that event, confound the two colonies; and, thinking, the Cimbri the fir&s;t inhabitants, and learning that the fir&s;t inhabitants came from Celtic Gaul, might of cour&s;e derive the Cimbri from Cel|tic Gaul. This origin of the Britons is the only one given by Beda, which &s;eems to need defence: and the rea&s;on is clear. The Gael had po&s;&s;ibly peopled this country two thou&s;and years before Chri&s;t, and the Cimbri one thou&s;and. No won|der then that, in &s;o remote events, Beda might be embarra&s;&s;ed. But the Piks had not come in till about 200 years before Chri&s;t; the Scots till 258 years after; nor the Jutes till 449 years after. The Piks had expelled the Cimbri; and even their arrival was a recent event, compared with that of the Welch Britons. Hence, tho Beda might err with regard to the origin of the&s;e Bri|tons, this would never invalidate his other origins. Indeed the origins of nations are the greate&s;t events in hi&s;tory, and leave the &s;tronge&s;t traces behind them. Beda's origin of the Angli has never been que&s;tioned. That of the Scots has, by the poor antiqui&s;ts of Scotland, who are the &s;hallowe&s;t that ever di&s;graced a country, and in&s;tead of READ|ING facts, per&s;i&s;t in WRITING opinions. The grand points of hi&s;tory &s;upported by all authorities which are FACTS in all other countries, are in Scot|land OPINIONS; and by a &s;pecies of ignorance, which we term philo&s;ophy, we doubt of all truth, but greedily embrace any fiction. This philo&s;ophy, we may depend of it, is but another name for &s;uperficiality, for which the writers of Scotland are &s;o noted all over Europe; and that philo&s;ophy which depends not on facts is wor&s;e than ignorance. But of this more fully when we come to treat of the origin of the Scots.</P>
<PB N="190" REF="277">
<P>Beda's account of the origin of the Piks &s;up|ports, and is &s;upported by, that of Tacitus. It follows. <HI>Et cum plurimam in&s;ulae partem</HI> [Britones] <HI>incipientes ab au&s;tro po&s;&s;edi&s;&s;ent, contigit gentem Picto|rum de Scythia, ut perhibent, longis natibus non multis, oceanum ingre&s;&s;am,</HI> &amp;c. and then telling us they proceeded to Ireland, but not finding a &s;ettle|ment went over to the north of Britain, where they &s;ettled; <HI>Itaque petentes Britanniam Picti, habitare per &s;eptentrionales in&s;ulae partes caeperunt. Nam au&s;trina Britones occupaverant.</HI> "And when the Britons, beginning from the &s;outh, had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the greater part of the iland, it happened that the nation of the Piks, entering the ocean from Scythia, as is reported, in not many large &s;hips," came to Ireland, where finding no &s;ettlement, they went over to North Britain; "Therefore the Piks going to Britain began to inhabit the northern parts of the iland. For the Britons had &s;eized the &s;outh."</P>
<P>The SCYTHIA of Beda is the GERMANY of Taci|tus. The later includes the nations of Scandinavia among the Germans; and Scythia had by Jor|nandes, 200 years before Beda, been a name given to Scandinavia: as indeed the Greeks had, 400 years before Chri&s;t, called Germany Scythia, and e&s;pecially the north of it, as may be &s;een in the Di&s;&s;ertation annexed. But to give the reader full &s;atisfaction on this point, let us examine it here a little.</P>
<P>The error of Jornandes did not con&s;i&s;t in calling Scandinavia, Scythia; for nothing is more certain, as &s;hewn in the Di&s;&s;ertation, than that the Germans and Scandinavians were Scythians. But it lay in &s;uppo&s;ing Scandinavia the mo&s;t ancient Scythia, from which all the Scythians proceeded. Jor|nandes tells, that the Scythians, or Goths, went from Scandinavia, his ancient Scythia, in three &s;hips, under king Berig; an event which, ac|cording to him, mu&s;t have happened two thou&s;and
<PB N="191" REF="278">years before Chri&s;t; for he after proceeds to &s;tate their progre&s;s to little Scythia, on the Euxine, and their expedition again&s;t Vexores, king of Egypt. This tale of Jornandes is in flat contra|diction to Herodotus, Diodorus Siculus, and other ancients; and is &s;o utterly childi&s;h, that it con|futes it&s;elf. The three &s;hips; the one that lagged behind, whence the nation of Gepidae, or Loit|erers; their arrival at Owin, in the north of Ger|many, where, by the falling of a bridge, a part were left, and the noi&s;e of their cattle heard to this day; are all circum&s;tances that would di&s;grace one of Mother Goo&s;e's Tales. Yet has this idiotic fable overturned the whole hi&s;tory of Europe! I beg pardon of Jornandes, it is not his tale, but a gro&s;s mi&s;conception of it, which has had &s;o important effects! A gro&s;s mi&s;conception which has pa&s;&s;ed current among the mo&s;t able writers, and at this hour &s;tains the pages of Monte&s;quieu, and other famous men!</P>
<Q>O caecas hominum mentes! O pectora caeca!</Q>
<P>This mi&s;conception lies in &s;uppo&s;ing that Jornandes brings the Goths from Scandinavia, about 200 years after Chri&s;t, as their name appears in Roman hi&s;tory about 250. Jornandes, ignorant as he was, well knew that, by the con&s;ent of all antiquity, the Scythians, Getae, and Goths, were one and the &s;ame people; and he always u&s;es the&s;e words &s;ynony|mou&s;ly; and he never even dreamed of the Goths being a late colony from Scandinavia, as above &s;hewn. Hence this gro&s;s error lyes totally with our modern <HI>celeberrimi,</HI> and not with Jornandes.</P>
<P>But the fact is, as amply detailed in the Di&s;&s;er|tation annexed, that the Scythians, otherwi&s;e called Getae, or Goths, proceeded from pre&s;ent Per&s;ia upward, over the river Araxes, in Armenia, and the mountains of Cauca&s;us, into little, or an|cient Scythia, on the Euxine. Thence they &s;pread into Thrace, Greece, Illyricum, Dacia, Germany,
<PB N="192" REF="279">Scandinavia. From Scandinavia they proceeded to Scotland, Jutland, and the Dani&s;h iles. From Germany, to Gaul, and Spain, and Italy; and form at this day almo&s;t the whole inhabitants of Europe, the few Celts in the Briti&s;h iles, the Fins of Lapland, Finland, and Hungary, and the Sar|matians of Ru&s;&s;ia and Poland, being the &s;ole ex|ceptions. Herodotus knew the Germans by no other name or di&s;tinction, but as Scythians. Timaeus, and other ancient writers, quoted by Pliny, call the north of Germany, Scythia. But Jornandes, being a writer much admired in the middle ages, was followed by I&s;idorus, Beda, Paulus Diaconus, &amp;c. and it is from him that we mu&s;t date their a&s;cription of the name of Scythia to Scandinavia. The old geographer of Ravenna, who, according to Gronovius, wrote in the eighth century, &s;ays, book V. p. 106. <HI>edit. Gronov.</HI> 1696, 8vo. <HI>In ip&s;o autem oceano &s;eptentrionali .... e&s;t in&s;ula quae dicitur Scanza, quae et Antiqua Scythia a plurimis co&s;mographis appellatur.</HI> 'In the northern ocean is an iland called Scanza,' (a name always given by Jor|nandes, &amp;c. to Scandinavia) 'whic his al&s;o called Ancient Scythia by many co&s;mographers.' Even &s;o late as the tenth century Audradus Modicus calls the Normans, who ravaged France in his time, SCYTHAE: <HI>apud Duche&s;ne Script. Franc.</HI> Tom. II. p. 361. Nay our Fordun, lib. I. c. 5. de&s;cribes Scythia as bounded by the Baltic; and c. 30, 31, &s;ays the Piks came from it. And the name was generally u&s;ed; for Ana&s;ta&s;ius Sinaita, a writer of the Ninth age, &s;ays, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">: 'The ancients are accu&s;tomed to call all the northern region Scythia, where are the Goths and Danes.' But not to in&s;i&s;t further on a point &s;o well known to the learned, let us proceed to &s;tate other evidences that the Piks came from Scandi|navia, tho the above be fully &s;ufficient, and any more proof be a work of &s;upererogation.</P>

But as we know not whether Nen|nius, or Samuel, was mo&s;t fooli&s;h, it is ab&s;urd to imagine with Bertram, his la&s;t editor, that Samuel was, and that the mo&s;t fooli&s;h pa&s;&s;ages are his; while they &s;eem to have been perfectly matched, &s;o that the whole work may be taken in the lump, and quoted as written by Nennius and Samuel.

Nennius and Samuel in their Fifth chapter, after narrating the arrival of the Britons, and before telling that of the Scots into Ireland from Spain, &s;ay, that 900 years after the time of Heli the prie&s;t, mentioned in ch. 4. and who lived 1200 years before Chri&s;t, that is, three hundred years before Chri&s;t, the Piks came to the Orkneys. Whence they &s;eized all the north part of Britain, amounting to one third; and "hold it to this day:" that is, in 858, or ju&s;t fifteen years after the Celtic dunces, who were the fathers of our hi&s;tory, tell that Kenneth, who in fact merely acceded to the Piki&s;h throne, as &s;hall be &s;hewn after, had conquered the Piks, &s;even times in one day, and inviting that whole great nation to an entertainment had killed them all&mdash;and eaten them up!

Indeed no one would ever think of &s;etting the&s;e Welch fablers again&s;t Tacitus and Beda, or even again&s;t Nennius and Samuel, their countrymen, but older by three whole centuries, and which la&s;t a&s;&s;ert the Piks to have been here 300 years before Chri&s;t. But not to in&s;i&s;t on a point where no difficulty occurs, it is well known to be quite another matter to know a FACT, and to

The Northern Sagas, and earlie&s;t Hi&s;tories, are infallibly right that the Goths came from Scythia on the Tanais; but when they date this in the time of Pompey, as Snorro does, they only excite laughter; for we know that the Goths could not, as they tell, pa&s;s thro all Ger|many, and go into Scandinavia by Jutland and Zeeland, while Cae&s;ar was at that very time war|ring in Germany, yet knew nothing of &s;o enormous an event. Chronology is always totally deficient among barbarous nations; and in traditional hi&s;|tory it is always utterly confu&s;ed.

But that the Piks were Goths from Scandinavia, is clear from Tacitus and Beda; and that Geofrey and Giraldus knew this great fact, tho they erred in the date, is no won|der. Facts remain while dates peri&s;h.</P>
<P>The countries neare&s;t Scotland, and who&s;e writers had of cour&s;e the be&s;t opportunity to mark the origin of the Piks, are Norway and Denmark on the ea&s;t, Iceland on the north: Ireland on the we&s;t, and England and Wales on the &s;outh. The writers of Norway, Denmark, and Iceland, are &s;ilent as to the event of the Piks pa&s;&s;ing to Scot|land; ju&s;t as Saxo and the others are &s;ilent as to the Jutes and Angles pa&s;&s;ing to England. But from them we fully trace the Piks in Norway, as above &s;hewn. The Engli&s;h and Welch writers are decided that the Piks came from Scandinavia,
<PB N="198" REF="285">as before &s;pecified; and &s;o are the Iri&s;h, as &s;hall be &s;tated. When all authorities thus agree, and every argument from rea&s;on &s;upports them; he mu&s;t be a mere theori&s;t, who would advance the weak dreams of Camden, Lloyd, and Innes (certainly not profound writers), again&s;t a fact po&s;itive even to mathematical truth, or at lea&s;t to a degree which no fact whatever in ancient hi&s;tory can ex|ceed: for no fact of Greek or Roman hi&s;tory is &s;upported by numerous te&s;timonies of neighbouring nations as this is.</P>
<P>O Flaherty, in his Ogygia, Part III. ch. 18. treats <HI>Pictorum in Hiberniam, et inde in Britanniam, migratio.</HI> 'The Migration of the Piks into Ireland, and thence to Britain.' His authority is nothing. It is that of the ancient writers, whom he and other Iri&s;h antiquaries quote, that merits re|gard. The&s;e &s;ay that the Piks came from Den|mark and Norway to Ireland, where finding no &s;ettlement, they went over to North Britain. The whole Iri&s;h annals that mention the Piki&s;h origin, and in particular the book of Lecan, place the ar|rival of the Piks in the reign of Heremon, the founder of the Mile&s;ian race; that is, as they dream, thirteen hundred years before Chri&s;t. This &s;hews however that in Ireland, which was in the time of Beda remarkable for &s;uch learning as then exi&s;ted, it was well known that the Piks had come to Scotland at a mo&s;t remote and ancient period.</P>
<P>It is unnece&s;&s;ary to add any more authorities. Suffice it to &s;ay, that EVERY writer who mentions the origin of the Piks till 1707, when Lloyd's Ar|chaeologia appeared, derives them from Scandinavia, <HI>excepting Camden alone.</HI> Camden applied to &s;ome very ignorant Welchman, as appears from his papers in the Mu&s;aeum<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Cotton Lib. Julius, F. X.</NOTE>, for etymologies and hints for his Britannia. Humphrey Lluyd, tho much
<PB N="199" REF="286">too learned to make the Piks Welch, had yet by his <HI>Commentariolum,</HI> printed about 1570, intro|duced a lunatic de&s;ire among his countrymen of making eminent men, and nations, of antiquity, Welch. Brennus and his German Gauls are with him all Welch of Wales, with other &s;uch anility. Hence this &s;illy Welch informant of Camden, being &s;o ignorant as not even to &s;u&s;pect the blaze of evidence again&s;t him, thought he would al&s;o try his hand, and make &s;ome more Welch; &s;o &s;eized on Galgacus and the Piks, and threw them into his Welch mold. But Camden, who was him&s;elf far from learned, &s;eems to have met his Welch adjutant half way; for &s;ome argu|ments, he details, &s;eem to be from his own pur&s;e. It appears from his work, that he clearly &s;aw the Caledonians and Piks were all one, which it indeed required no penetration to di&s;cover: he al&s;o knew that the Caledonians were Britons&mdash;here was the rub! He forgot that he was him&s;elf a Briton; and yet was no Welchman. Had he redd Cae&s;ar he might have learned that the Belgae, who po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed half of pre&s;ent England, when Cae&s;ar came, were Britons, and yet were not Welch, but real Goths of Germany; or, if you plea&s;e, real Engli&s;hmen, being as much Engli&s;h as the Sax|ons. But the <HI>arguments</HI> that the Piks were Welch being already &s;hewn in the preceding Section to be childi&s;h and ab&s;urd, that ri&s;ible ground need not be trodden again. Camden is a valuable topo|grapher, which he may well be without any pre|tence to learning; but with regard to the origin of nations, a &s;ubject requiring the mo&s;t profound learning, he knew as much as a child; and is the object of laughter and contempt to his learned countrymen, U&s;her, Stillingfleet, Sheringham, and others.</P>
<P>At length this Eighteenth century, fatal to real and &s;olid literature, was to ari&s;e. A century in which men, women, and children, write, and all write alike well: as indeed all may follow a trade
<PB N="200" REF="287" MS="Y">in which no apprenticeship is now required. A cen|tury in which learning, the grand foundation of phi|lo&s;ophy among the ancients, is de&s;pi&s;ed; and ig|norance is called philo&s;ophy. Now and not be|fore, among other great di&s;coveries, were the whole nations of Europe to be Celts: and the Piks to be Welch, Iri&s;h, or what you will. That the Piks were Welch is &s;upported by the names of Lloyd, Innes, Guthrie, Hume, Whitaker, &amp;c. and within the&s;e ten years that they were Gael, or Iri&s;h, by tho&s;e of that <HI>par nobile</HI> the Macpher|&s;ons, of Henry and i tremble to &s;ay Gibbon, which la&s;t in&s;tead of be&s;towing even the &s;lighte&s;t exa|mination on the &s;ubject, has been led by the Macpher&s;ons, who&s;e little local de&s;igns his large mind could not even &s;u&s;pect.

But &s;ince printing is invented the materials of &s;cience cannot be lo&s;t, tho &s;cience it&s;elf may; and it may &s;afely be prophecied that learning, as it ebbs in one century, may flow in another.

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER IV.</HI> Epoch of the Piki&s;h &s;ettlement in Scotland.</HEAD>
<P>THE time when the Piks fir&s;t &s;ettled in pre&s;ent Scotland well de&s;erves a &s;eparate con&s;idera|tion. Chronology is the late&s;t improvement of hi&s;tory; and is never to be expected among un|civilized nations. Yet of the period of the great event now con&s;idered there are many marks.</P>
<P>From the Di&s;&s;ertation, at the end of this work, it will appear that the Goths had peopled Germany and Scandinavia about 500 years before our aera. Being a progeny who&s;e &s;ole trade was war, their inroads upon their neighbours were perpetual; and their progre&s;s, from their &s;uperiority in arms, continuous. The &s;ettlements of the Belgae, and other German nations in Gaul, cannot be dated later than 400 years before Chri&s;t; for in Cae&s;ar's time we find them &s;pred from Belgic Gaul, over a great part of Britain; and &s;o effectually fixt as to be warring among them&s;elves, the Cimbri their old enemies being driven to the north and we&s;t. Not le&s;s than 150 years can, in the cour&s;e of hu|man affairs, be allowed for &s;o ample and complete a &s;ettlement as this of the Belgae in Britain; and Cae&s;ar gives no hint that it was a recent affair. So that it may &s;afely be &s;uppo&s;ed that the Belgae, the real ance&s;tors of three quarters of the pre&s;ent Engli&s;h, were &s;ettled in the &s;outh and ea&s;t coa&s;ts, at lea&s;t 200 years before Chri&s;t; and began the&s;e &s;ettlements about 300 years before Chri&s;t.</P>
<PB N="202" REF="289">
<P>The Peukini, Peohtar, Pihtar, Vichar, or Piks, were, as would appear, al&s;o &s;ettled in Scan|dinavia at lea&s;t 500 years before our aera. From thence their only two ancient migrations were into pre&s;ent Scotland, and into pre&s;ent Denmark. It is matter of curious con&s;ideration which of the&s;e colonies preceded in order of time. From the greater vicinity of Denmark, it might rea&s;onably be inferred that it was held by the earlie&s;t colony. But there are facts which weigh again&s;t this opi|nion: and human affairs by no means proceed in formal order.</P>
<P>The Cimbri, or Cimmerii, ancient Celtic inha|bitants of Germany, and who &s;pred from the Bo&s;phorus Cimmerius on the Euxine, north to about Mo&s;cow in Ru&s;&s;ia, where was the <HI>Promon|torium Celticae,</HI> mentioned by Pliny; and we&s;t to the Cher&s;one&s;us Cimmerius, or Jutland, and to Britain, where the Cumri, or Welch, &s;till retain their name, as the aboriginal Iri&s;h do that of Gael, or Gaulic Celts, the&s;e Cimbri proceeded into Italy 120 years before Chri&s;t. They had been expelled from the north we&s;t of Germany, not by incroach|ment of the Sea, as Plutarch fables, but by inva|&s;ion of that Gothic ocean of men, which over|whelmed all Europe. Tacitus found only a few remains of them at the &s;outh-we&s;t extremity of pre&s;ent Jutland. All around were German na|tions, who, if we do not reject all authorities and facts, were Goths; while the Cimbri, if we follow not the &s;ame plan, were Celts. The&s;e &s;mall re|mains &s;hew that the Cimbri were expelled; for had they left their country from exce&s;s of popu|lation, as the Gothic nations did, that population could not have totally failed in two centuries. That they were driven out by a nation from the north has been already &s;hewn; and that this nation was the Piks, who &s;eizing their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions became the Vits of Vitland, now Jutland, and of Vit&s;lett,
<PB N="203" REF="290">or the Dani&s;h Iles. That the Jutes and Danes came from Scandinavia has al&s;o been &s;hewn to be clear from that infallible mark, their language, which is the Scandinavian dialect of the Gothic, and not the German dialect of that tongue. Now Plutarch and other ancients de&s;cribe the progre&s;s of the Cimbri into Gaul, and their attacks of Spain and Italy, as events of rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and not more than ten years can be allowed for the whole. So that the expul&s;ion of the Cimbri from pre&s;ent Denmark could not take place more than 112 years before Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>The Cimbri of pre&s;ent Denmark were between two fires, the Germans on the &s;outh, and Scan|dinavians on the north; whence we may naturally conclude, that their defence of their la&s;t rece&s;s on the continent was very long, and ob&s;tinate as de|&s;pair could make it. The Piks might al&s;o &s;tand in awe of the Germans, who might have regarded their inva&s;ion of the Cimbri as an attack of terri|tories, more properly their own prey, as con|tiguous neighbours; while the Piks were divided from them by a wide &s;ea. Hence it would require the full power of the Piks, and long and de&s;perate conte&s;ts, to effectuate their conque&s;t of pre&s;ent Denmark: and Denmark de&s;erves to be con&s;idered as the mo&s;t hazardous and glorious of the Piki&s;h &s;ettlements.</P>
<P>Far other was the ca&s;e with the Piki&s;h popula|tion of Scotland. There was indeed a wider &s;ea between Scandinavia and Scotland, than between Scandinavia and Jutland. But, on the other hand, to pa&s;s this &s;ea was a matter &s;o ea&s;y, even to bar|barians, that Indians in their canoes have peopled regions twice as di&s;tant; and to this day the &s;avage Fins in their &s;kiffs have come even from Finland to the Shetland and Orkney iles, a cour&s;e of at lea&s;t &s;ix hundred miles further than that between the &s;outh of Norway and Scotland, which ex|ceeds
<PB N="204" REF="291" MS="Y">not two hundred and fifty miles<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">It is al&s;o probable, that there were &s;undry iles between Norway and Scotland anciently, tho now &s;wallowed up. The <HI>Saxonum In&s;ulae</HI> of Ptolemy are lo&s;t: and <HI>Helgoland,</HI> an iland in the &s;ame parts, was, a few centuries ago, reduced to one quarter of it's ancient &s;ize. See Bleau's Atlas, for a map of ancient and modern Helgoland. If the Piks coa&s;ted along the &s;hore of Norway northward, and then pa&s;&s;ed over to the Shetland Iles, the pa&s;&s;age is not above 150 miles.</NOTE>. Tacitus<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Germania, <HI>prope fin.</HI></NOTE> al&s;o informs us that the Suiones, who were really the Piks of Vit&s;let, called Suiones, or Zeewoners by their &s;outhern neighbours, the Germans, be|cau&s;e they <HI>dwelled</HI> in the <HI>&s;ea</HI> (as ilanders) were re|markable for navigation, having FLEETS, an ad|vantage quite unknown to the other German and Scandinavian &s;tates. And the&s;e fleets were of SHIPS, <HI>navium,</HI> which Tacitus thus de&s;cribes. "The form of the &s;hips differs from ours, becau&s;e that a prow at either end makes landing always ca&s;y. They have no &s;ails, nor are the oars ranged in order on the fides. The ve&s;&s;el is of free con|&s;truction, as u&s;ed on &s;ome rivers; and may be &s;teered to whatever point is nece&s;&s;ary." This &s;hews to a certainty, that navigation was not on|ly known to the&s;e Scandinavians, but had arrived at &s;uch perfection, that Tacitus talks of their SHIPS, and compares them with the Roman. A pa&s;&s;age of 250 miles in open &s;ea was certainly no great affair to the dauntle&s;s courage of that people. In later times we find them in ve&s;&s;els, perhaps neither larger nor more artificial, ravaging Eng|land, Ireland, and France; nay, di&s;covering Ice|land and Greenland, and Vinland, or a part of North America<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">See the Vinlandia Antiqua of Torfaeus, 1705, 8vo. and Northern Antiquities, Vol. 1. p. 280. It was pact of Canada, or of Newfoundland, and di&s;covered, in the year 1001, by He|riol and Biarn, Icelanders.</NOTE>. Their inva&s;ion of Scotland had none of the&s;e difficulties to be found in that of Denmark. In Denmark the Cimbri were com|pre&s;&s;ed,
<PB N="205" REF="292">and crouded to a point, and very numer|ous. In Scotland the population was loo&s;e, and vague, as u&s;ual among the Celts, a pa&s;toral peo|ple. In Denmark the Cimbri were confined, and bold from de&s;pair. In Scotland they had free egre&s;s to their brethren in the &s;outh, and to Ire|land. In Scotland there were no Suevi, no northern Germans, 'to whom the gods were not equal<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Cae&s;ar Bell. Gall. lib. IV. where the &s;outhern Germans &s;ay: '&s;e&s;e unis Suevis concedere, quibus ne dii quidem im|mortales pares e&s;&s;e po&s;&s;int.'</NOTE>,' to awe the Piks from an inva&s;ion of ter|ritories contiguous to their own, and marked as their prey.</P>
<P>I have all along Con&s;idered the pa&s;&s;age of the Piks from Norway to the Orkneys as the &s;ole point worth con&s;ideration in this progre&s;s; and every reader will, it is believed, regard it in the &s;ame light. For the <HI>coa&s;ting</HI> voyage from the Ork|neys to Ireland and the Hebudes was nothing even to an Indian canoe. The Romans thought it a &s;erious affair to pa&s;s from Gaul to Britain; yet their fleet, during Agricola's campaigns, coa&s;ted all round Britain, and fir&s;t di&s;covered it to be an iland, as Tacitus &s;hews. And they after ven|tured into the Zuyder Zee, and the Baltic. But <HI>coa&s;ting</HI> voyages of great length are ea&s;ily performed, even by the mo&s;t barbaric navigation: and there is no occa&s;ion to explain the cau&s;es of a matter &s;o well known, and obvious. The pa&s;&s;age from Norway to the Orkneys was the only difficulty; and that cea&s;ed to be a difficulty to people &s;o &s;killed in navigation as in the time of Tacitus to have fleets of &s;hips. Hence there can be no he&s;i|tation in believing that the Piks proceeded to Scotland, near two centures before they were &s;o bold as to &s;eize on Denmark; while indeed we have direct authorities that &s;uch was the ca&s;e. And there are al&s;o collateral proofs, that the Cim|bri
<PB N="206" REF="293" MS="Y">mu&s;t have been driven out of Scotland (north of Loch Fyn, and Tay), &s;ooner than out of Den|mark, for Tacitus found remains of the Cimbri in the &s;outh of pre&s;ent Denmark; and the Dani&s;h hi&s;tories are full of the Cimbri, who, according to them, were conquered by the Goths about the time of Pompey: while in Scotland, north of the above bounds, we &s;hould not have known that the Cimbri ever dwelled, &s;ave by a few Cumraig names of rivers, mountains, and &s;tations of old Cimbric towns. But that the Piks did not po&s;&s;e&s;s Denmark till about 112 years before Chri&s;t, has been &s;hewn above; and that they held Scotland at lea&s;t 200 years before Chri&s;t, will appear from the following di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Tacitus is the fir&s;t who mentions the people of Caledonia, or Piks; and tho he &s;ays they were certainly of Germany, he drops no hint as to the time of their pa&s;&s;age. Eumenius, the Panegyri&s;t, &s;ays, that before the time of Julius Cae&s;ar the Piks were the accu&s;tomed enemies of the Britons. He u&s;es the term Britons in the then acceptation of the word, for the Cumraig Britons, tho&s;e whom Cae&s;ar thought born in the iland. For the Piks were quite unknown to the Romans, &s;ave in Britain. Hence Eumenius is a witne&s;s that the Piks were &s;ettled in the north of Britain before the time of Julius Cae&s;ar.</P>
<P>Beda dates the &s;ettlement of the Piks in Britain, as coeval with what he thought it's fir&s;t habitation by the Cumraig Britons: and he tells us in expre&s;s terms, that they were the fir&s;t inhabitants of the northern parts. The Cumri &s;eem to have po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed Britain 1000 years before Chri&s;t; and, by Beda's account, the Piks did as anciently. But Beda, &s;peaking of the pa&s;&s;age of the Britons from Armorica, &s;eems rather to allude to the Belgic Britons; who were in fact coeval with the Piks in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, both coming in, as would &s;eem, between 300 and 200 years before our aera.</P>
<PB N="207" REF="294">
<P>Nennius and Samuel report, from Briti&s;h tra|dition, that the Piks came to the Orkneys 900 years after Eli, who lived 1200 years before Chri&s;t; that is, THREE HUNDRED years before our aera. Abandoning the Orkneys, which Solinus men|tions as uninhabited, even in his time, or 250 years after Chri&s;t, they pa&s;&s;ed to Ireland; then &s;tood over to the Hebud iles, their fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion here, and in time the early &s;eat of their king|dom. The&s;e are the <HI>neighbouring iles</HI> of Nennius, whence he tells us, the Piks ravaged and &s;eized on all the northern part of Britain, amounting to one third. For this large conque&s;t of a hilly country full of rece&s;&s;es, and con&s;equent population of it, we cannot allow le&s;s than a century: and the Piks may be regarded as inhabitants of all the country north of Loch Fyn and Tay, about 200 years be|fore Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>The Iri&s;h Annals, above quoted, date the fir&s;t king of the Piks as early as the time of Here|mon; or, as they dream, 1300 years before our aera. But their &s;ettlement preceded this fir&s;t king a long time; and the Piki&s;h kings, down to 400 years after Chri&s;t, were merely princes of the Hebud iles, as after to be mentioned.</P>
<P>From the&s;e circum&s;tances, and e&s;pecially from the direct authority of Nennius and Samuel, the &s;ettlement of the Piks in the Hebud iles may be dated, with as great certainty as any event in the earlie&s;t Greek or Roman hi&s;tory, at 300 years be|fore Chri&s;t. And their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all Scotland north of Fyn and Tay, at a century after, or 200 years before our aera. If you date this event later, you will find Eumenius, Beda, Nennius, and the Iri&s;h Annals, again&s;t you. If earlier, you will interfere with the Gothic progre&s;s, detailed in the Di&s;&s;ertation added. While, with the date here a&s;&s;igned, all authorities and circum&s;tances agree.</P>

<P>When the Engli&s;h hi&s;tory becomes &s;tudied by Engli&s;h writers, and it is univer&s;ally perceived that the Belgae, a Gothic people who fought in this ile with Julius Cae&s;ar, are the real ance&s;tors of three quarters of the pre&s;ent Engli&s;h, it may prove a national que&s;tion, whether the Belgae, or Piks, were the fir&s;t Goths who took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Britain. This que&s;tion might be agitated to all eternity, for it is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to decide it.

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER V.</HI> Province of Ve&s;pa&s;iana.</HEAD>
<P>THIS province re&s;ts entirely upon the autho|rity of Richard of Cirence&s;ter, a writer of the fourteenth century; not one trace of it being to be found in any other author, till after his book was publi&s;hed in 1757. It would &s;eem from his accounts to have been founded after the victories of Lollius Urbicus, and the erection of the wall of Antoninus, about the year 140; and Richard &s;pecially mentions that it was lo&s;t in the year 170, which was in the time of Marcus Antoninus. His predece&s;&s;or Pius, in who&s;e reign it was acquired, appears to have given it the name of Ve&s;pa&s;iana, from the emperor, to who&s;e reign Agricola was indebted for his glory, in fir&s;t &s;ubduing it.</P>
<P>Richard hints, p. 31<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Haec provincia dicta e&s;t in honorem familiae Flaviae, cui &s;uam Domitianus Imperator originem debuit, et &s;ub quo ex|pugnata, Ve&s;pa&s;iana.</NOTE>. that it was called Ve&s;|pa&s;iana from the name of that emperor, who brought the Flavian family to the Roman throne; and received that name in Domitian's time. But that Agricola founded this province &s;eems improba|ble; for Richard, who&s;e authority is all we have for it's exi&s;tence, &s;ays expre&s;&s;ly, it was lo&s;t in 170; and Hadrian built his wall, between Solway and Tyne, about 120, and would certainly have built
<PB N="210" REF="297">it between Clyde and Forth at lea&s;t, had Ve&s;pa&s;iana been then &s;ubject to Rome. Richard al&s;o repeat|edly mentions the very &s;hort time that this pro|vince was &s;ubject to Rome. Had Agricola founded it about the year 80, it mu&s;t have exi&s;ted 90 years, no &s;hort &s;pace; whereas 30 years &s;eem the mo&s;t that can be allowed.</P>
<P>Tacitus is al&s;o a clear witne&s;s again&s;t Ve&s;pa&s;iana being founded by Agricola, for he &s;ays <HI>perdomita Britannia, et &s;iatim mi&s;&s;a,</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. lib.

For after Cri&s;pinus, in Domitian's time, we find no hint concerning Britain, till Hadrian withdrew the boundary.</P>
<P>This province Ve&s;pa&s;iana, according to Richard, &s;tretched north from the Forth and Clyde up to Linnhe Loch and Loch Ne&s;s, or that line upon which Forts William, Augu&s;tus, and George, now &s;tand. In it were the nations <HI>Hore&s;tii</HI> of Fife; <HI>Vecturones,</HI> or Venricones, beyond the Tay, or in Perth and Angus; <HI>Taixali</HI> of Aberdeen&s;hire; <HI>Va|comagi</HI> of Murray, and a part of Inverne&s;s; <HI>Dam|nii Albani</HI> and <HI>Attacotti</HI> of Argyle&s;hire. Richard's geography has no chronology; and the times of Agricola and Theodo&s;ius are all confounded by him; hence the Attacotti, unknown to Ptolemy, or the Roman writers, till a late period, and who actually came from Ireland, about 258, as after &s;hewn, are foi&s;ted in here.</P>
<P>The towns of the <HI>Hore&s;tii,</HI> by Richard's account, were <HI>Alauna, Lindum,</HI> and <HI>Victoria.</HI> The <HI>Vectu|rones,</HI> or <HI>Venricones,</HI> had <HI>Orrea,</HI> and two rivers <HI>Ae&s;ica</HI> and <HI>Tina.</HI> The <HI>Taixali</HI> had <HI>Divana,</HI> and the rivers <HI>Deva</HI> and <HI>Ituna.</HI> The <HI>Vacomagi,</HI> a large nation, had three towns, <HI>Tue&s;&s;is, Tamea,</HI> and <HI>Banatia,</HI> with <HI>Ptoroton,</HI> perhaps now Inverne&s;s,
<PB N="211" REF="298">the metropolis of the province; their rivers <HI>Va|rar, Tue&s;is,</HI> and <HI>Celnius.</HI> The <HI>Attacotti</HI> had <HI>Theo|do&s;ia,</HI> or Alcluith, built by Theodo&s;ius: which la&s;t is a palpable error, for Alcluith, or Theodo&s;ia, was in Valentia.</P>
<P>Richard al&s;o gives an itinerary of this province, thus: ITER IX. <HI>A Luguballio Ptorotonim u&s;que, &s;ic:</HI> Trimontio <HI>m. p.</HI> . . . Gadanica <HI>m. p.</HI> . . .

<P>This new province is the mo&s;t prominent and re|markable part of Richard's book. To tru&s;t an author of the fourteenth century, for &s;o great an affair, &s;eems ra&s;h. Yet two thirds of his work we know to be true, from Ptolemy and other ancients; and the Itinerary, he &s;ays, is from the memorials of a Roman Dux, or Governor of Britain. Certain it is, that his ac|counts quadrate amazingly, and bear every mark of truth. The few names he gives of rivers, &amp;c. not in Ptolemy, often re&s;emble the pre|&s;ent names; yet are &s;o truly latinized, that Roman mouths alone &s;eem able to have formed them. This province of Ve&s;pa&s;iana is repeatedly mentioned, upon many occa&s;ions, in the cour&s;e of his work, be&s;ide the &s;pecial de&s;cription he gives of it.</P>
<P>Had &s;uch a province exi&s;ted for 90 years, as Richard &s;eems to in&s;inuate, many Roman in&s;crip|tions, coins, &amp;c. mu&s;t at this day be found in it's
<PB N="212" REF="299">limits. But, as mentioned above, 30 years &s;eem to have formed it's real duration. Yet even from that &s;pace in&s;criptions and coins may be expected. Ptorotone, or Inverne&s;s, the capital of the pro|vince, mu&s;t in that ca&s;e have many Roman re|mains. Urns of Roman coins have been found in the north of Scotland; but the&s;e may have been carried off in booty by the Piks. Roman in&s;criptions, roads, and remains of buildings, are what we mu&s;t look for, as confirmations of the province of Ve&s;pa&s;iana.</P>
<P>Arthur's Oven, which Hor&s;eley plau&s;ibly thinks a &s;epulchre, &s;tood about ten miles beyond the wall of Antoninus. The author of an old map, in the Additamenta to Matthew Paris, &s;ays the great Roman way went to Caithne&s;s<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">See it publi&s;hed in Mr. Gough's Briti&s;h Topography.</NOTE>, a vague name for the northern parts of Scotland. If my memory &s;erves me, one Roman in&s;cription was found in Stirling&s;hire; tho i cannot &s;ay where i found this information. Chance may befriend us afterward, and a pea&s;ant digging a ditch may di&s;|cover a Roman province. Mr. Nimmo, in his Hi&s;tory of Stirling&s;hire, de&s;cribes the great Ro|man way running thro that &s;hire, and north to Stratherne. If it can be traced to Inverne&s;s, it will be an INFALLIBLE confirmation of the pro|vince of Ve&s;pa&s;iana; for &s;uch ways were never made, &s;ave in the provinces; as it would have been indeed madne&s;s to attempt &s;uch a va&s;t labour as a Roman military road, in an enemy's country, and impo&s;&s;ible to accompli&s;h it. As the ca&s;e &s;tands, tho not willing to lend credit to Richard implicitly, yet i confe&s;s even this Roman Road to the Tay is with me a full and complete confir|mation of Richard's account; for a Roman road was never made, &s;ave in a Roman province. And it was of cour&s;e the fir&s;t care, in order to facilitate intercour&s;e, and keep the province in order. A
<PB N="213" REF="300">military way can be traced thro Trajan's province of Dacia, up to it's furthe&s;t extremity; but beyond a province, no road was ever made: and the idea would have been madne&s;s, as it would have been to incur great danger and expence&mdash;to &s;erve the enemy: not to add, that it was utterly impracti|cable.</P>
<P>This Roman road pa&s;&s;es from Ca&s;tlecary, on the wall of Antoninus (along which wall a &s;imi|lar road runs), north to Stirling town, about &s;ix|teen Engli&s;h miles. From thence it goes north by Keir to Dunblane; and thence on to Stratherne, beyond which Mr. Nimmo &s;ays nothing of it's progre&s;s, as not being examined by him. But this cour&s;e cannot be le&s;s than 30 miles. Mr. Nimmo de&s;cribes this great road as con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal layers of &s;tone and earth, which &s;eem to have been thrown upon one another as they came to hand, for the &s;tones are of all dimen&s;ions. It is generally about twelve feet in breadth; and it's foundation is &s;o deep, that, in the formation of it, they &s;eem fir&s;t to have digged a ditch, which they filled up again with &s;tones and earth, till they rai&s;ed it at lea&s;t a foot above the &s;urface. It al|ways ri&s;es in the middle, and &s;lopes toward the edges; and on each &s;ide, e&s;pecially where the ground is mar&s;hy, there has been a &s;mall ditch, or drain, to keep the work dry: &s;o that at pre&s;ent, when it is all covered with gra&s;s, it has much the re&s;emblance of a ridge that has lain long unplowed. The &s;tones of the uppermo&s;t layer are generally of &s;o large a &s;ize, that, unle&s;s it was always well covered with gravel, it mu&s;t have been very in|commodious to travel on. It's direction is as &s;traight as the nature of the ground, thro which it pa&s;&s;es, will permit.</P>
<P>Another part of this Roman way &s;till further north, and in the &s;hire of Angus, is de&s;cribed, and illu&s;trated with a map, in the <HI>Bibliotheca Topographica Britannica,</HI> N^o XXXVI. London,
<PB N="214" REF="301">1786, 4to. This part is &s;een about three miles north-ea&s;t of Forfar, and there are two Roman camps on it, at about eight miles di&s;tance from each other. Roman Granaries were al&s;o found lately on the e&s;tate of Lundie, a few miles north-ea&s;t of Dundee: and granaries certainly could not be erected but in a province.</P>
<P>General Roy<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Roman Antiquities in North Britain, MS. in the King's Library. Other proofs of this province may be drawn from that valuable work. Roman coins, he &s;ays, are often found at Nairn, which is in the northern extremity of Ve&s;pa&s;iana; as were al&s;o a Roman &s;word and &s;pear. Fortingal, in Glen|lyon, Braidalbin, is well known to be a Roman fort, not a camp. At Ardoch is a fine Roman &s;tation, which the general thinks <HI>Lindum.</HI> Inch Tuthill, on the Tay, is another very re|markable and beautiful, which may be <HI>In Medio.</HI> Gordon al&s;o, <HI>Itin.

Scotl.</HI> p. 149, tells us, that a Roman bath was found at Delvin, a Roman &s;tation on the ea&s;t &s;ide of Tay; and men|tions, p. 214, a Roman way from Fortingal toward Loch Tay. He al&s;o gives an in&s;cription found at Ardoch, and pre|&s;erved at Drummond ca&s;tle, <HI>Amonius Damionis cobortis primae Hi&s;panorum &s;tipendiorum xxvii. Haeredes fieri curarunt.</HI> Hor&s;eley p. 206, gives an in&s;cription on a rock upon the north &s;ide of Stirling ca&s;tle, apparently Roman, tho copied by &s;ome ignorant hand. Sir J. Dalrymple, <HI>Remarks on Camden,</HI> p. 181, mentions a fine marble ve&s;&s;el, curiou&s;ly engraven, and full of Roman coins, being found at Bean-ca&s;tle, near Nairn, 1460. Nairn may be the <HI>Ca&s;tra Alata.</HI></NOTE> &s;ays, the Roman way ends at Reedy; but he &s;u&s;pects that ve&s;tiges of it may be di&s;covered further north; and he mentions that the people of the country think it extends to Aberdeen.</P>
<P>Till it can be &s;hewn that a Roman road was ever made, &s;ave in a Roman province, we have therefore ab&s;olute proof of the province of Ve&s;|pa&s;iana; and the hi&s;torian of Scotland will do well to mark it's commencement about the year 140, and it's termination in 170. It does honour to the military prowe&s;s of the Piks, that this province had the &s;horte&s;t duration of any ever held by the Romans.</P>
<PB N="215" REF="302">
<P>Tho this province was &s;o &s;oon abandoned, yet the Romans repeatedly vi&s;ited this part of Britain. Our antiqui&s;ts fondly a&s;cribe all Roman remains in it to Agricola, tho this be nearly as ridiculous as it would be to impute tho&s;e in Valentia to him. He was rather the fir&s;t di&s;coveror of Ve&s;pa&s;iana, than the conquerer. In Valentia appeared Agri|cola, Bolanus, Lucullus, Hadrian, Lollius Ur|bicus, Marcellus<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Xiphilinus <HI>in Commodo</HI> &s;ays, Commodus &s;ent Marcellus Ulpius to repre&s;s the Britons who had pa&s;&s;ed the wall.</NOTE>, Pertinax, Severus, Geta, Ca|racalla, Con&s;tantius Chlorus, Con&s;tantine I. Con|tans, Theodo&s;ius, Gallio: and, except di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by in&s;criptions, no &s;ober antiquary will &s;ay to which of the&s;e mu&s;t be a&s;cribed the Roman remains found in Valentia. In Ve&s;pa&s;iana Tacitus &s;ufficiently marks the actions of AGRICOLA. The battle with Galgacus, General Roy thinks, was fought near Stonehaven; and as he has travelled over Scotland with a military, as well as an an|tiquarian eye, great re&s;pect is due to his opinion. Agricola appears to have been little further north; and, as he was in&s;tantly ordered home by Domi|tian, there is no po&s;&s;ibility of his having left many works behind him. BOLANUS, as we learn from Statius, erected many works in Britain, and apparently in the north. But after this Britain was <HI>&s;tatim mi&s;&s;a,</HI> as Tacitus &s;ays in his Hi&s;tory written about the year 110. About the year 120, Hadrian, far from keeping Ve&s;pa&s;iana, could hardly retain Valentia; but built his wall from Solway to Tine. Yet about 150, when Ptolemy wrote, we find Ve&s;pa&s;iana full of Roman towns. For the&s;e we are &s;urely indebted to LOLLIUS URBICUS only, who, about the year 140, carried the Roman arms in Britain to a greater extent than ever; as the wall of Antoninus, and work of Ptolemy, re|main la&s;ting proofs. To him therefore ought chiefly to be a&s;cribed the Roman remains in Ve|pa&s;iana.
<PB N="216" REF="303">This province was quite lo&s;t about the year 170, in &s;pite of the efforts Of CALPHURNIUS under Marcus Antoninus.

<P>From Tacitus, and Ptolemy, it is clear that the Caledonians, or Piks, held then all pre&s;ent Scotland, north of Loch Fyn and Tay.

<P>Richard tells us<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Lib. I. c. 7. ex Ptolemaeo et aliunde nonnullis ordinem quoque, &s;ed quod &s;pero in melius, mutatum hinc inde depre|hendes. The term <HI>Kelydhon,</HI> or <HI>Woodlands,</HI> might indeed be given by the Cumraig Britons to all the fore&s;ts in Britain; and thence different <HI>Silvae Caledoniae,</HI> the Romans taking <HI>Kelydon</HI> for aproper name. But no region in Britain was called <HI>Cale|donia;</HI> or it's people <HI>Caledonii;</HI> except in the north. Ptolemy knew only of one <HI>Silva Caledonia,</HI> that among the Caledonii. Richard quotes Lucan for his <HI>&s;ilva Caledonia</HI> in Kent; and Florus III. 10. for that in Lincoln-&s;hire! But it may be judged from the&s;e writers, that the Caledonians, and their fore&s;t, were famous among the Southern Britons; and of cour&s;e vaguely &s;poken of by the Romans, till Tacitus and Ptolemy di&s;clo&s;ed their real &s;ituation.</NOTE> he altered his authorities; and, when he differs from Ptolemy, de&s;erves no credit. The pa&s;&s;age of Lucan only &s;hews that even in his time the Caledonians were the mo&s;t warlike and famous of the Britons; whence he ignorantly and improperly applies their name to the whole. Flac|cus refers not to the &s;torm that damaged the fleet of Julius Cae&s;ar; but only &s;ays that the Caledonian ocean <HI>di&s;dained</HI> him, for he never proceeded &s;o far. But to oppo&s;e Lucan a poet who lived before any Roman had &s;een Caledonia, and Richard of Ci|rence&s;ter, a monk of the Fourtenth century, to Tacitus and Ptolemy, who &s;o clearly te&s;tify that the name of Caledonians was peculiar to the Northern Britons, or Piks, were too ab&s;urd to de|&s;erve an an&s;wer. Large friths, and great fear, had &s;eparated the Piks from the Cumri, &s;o that the later &s;eem to have called them Caledonians, or Woodlanders, as we &s;peak of Highlanders, not having any intercour&s;e with them, &s;o as to know their proper name. But when the Romans and

<P>Nothing more puzzles a common reader than the multitude of <HI>nations,</HI> which he finds in the an|cient barbaric countries. He is apt to conclude them all nations, in the modern acceptation; of different manners and origins. But the&s;e nations were only tribes, or, as we might &s;ay, people of different &s;hires. The nations of &s;avages in America are living images of the&s;e ancient nations.</P>
<P>Let us now proceed to &s;tate the Caledonian or Piki&s;h tribes, as given by Ptolemy. This geo|grapher wrote in the reign of Antoninus Pius, as appears from his works. It &s;eems al&s;o certain that he wrote after the province of Ve&s;pa&s;iana was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed; for the Roman towns <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> <HI>Victoria,</HI> and <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>Ca&s;tra Alata,</HI> could in no other ca&s;e have appeared in the pre&s;ent &s;hires of Perth and Inverne&s;s. It has been &s;hewn that the province Ve&s;pa&s;iana could not be erected be|fore Hadrian's time; nor till Lollius Urbicus by his victories obtained to Antoninus Pius the &s;tyle of Britannicus, which appears on &s;ome of his coins: and by his great progre&s;s to the north occa&s;ioned the foundation of the wall of Antoninus. The very name of <HI>Ca&s;tra Alata,</HI> as given by Ptolemy, is an invincible proof that the Roman light troops were &s;tationed there, to protect this military and frontier province. Had not this part of Scotland been &s;ubject to Rome, the names of towns would have been barbarous, as tho&s;e of Ireland given by Ptolemy, and could not have borne the&s;e irrefra|gable marks of Roman power. Agricola, to whom our infantine Scoti&s;h antiqui&s;ts impute all the Roman remains in Scotland, had no time to build towns; as he was commanded home the very year he defeated Galgacus. Had he built them, the Piks, who ravaging all the north

This wall could not have been built in the face of an enemy; and a con&s;iderable territory be|yond it mu&s;t have been &s;ubject to the Romans, as we know to have been the ca&s;e with that of Hadrian. Ptolemy &s;eems to have written his geography about the year 150: and the Piki&s;h tribes, as he de|&s;cribes them, going up the ea&s;t &s;hore, and down the we&s;t, were as follow.</P>

Richard &s;ays that as <HI>traditions</HI> bore, the Cantae and Carnabii formed an alliance in the time of O&s;torius, and fled to Caledonia from the Roman yoke: What tradi|tions could reach Richard's time concerning this event, it is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive; and i will venture to &s;ay there could be none; but that the &s;imilarity of names led him to this conjecture; and he pretended traditions, for&s;ooth, to &s;trengthen it. O&s;torius was here in the time of Claudius, when the Roman arms had not reached &s;o far north as the Carnabii; nor, if &s;o remarkable an event had taken place, could it have e&s;caped th&eacute; notice of Tacitus, who, in the twelfth book of his Annals, relates the actions of O&s;torius, and his conque&s;t of Caractacus, at due length. This tale therefore wants all probability; and even wants po&s;&s;ibility, then we con&s;ider that the Cantae were 200 miles from the Carnabii, the former in pre&s;ent Kent, and the later in Lanca&s;hire; the former a Belgic people, the later a Cumraig; that is as different as Welch from Engli&s;h.

But, as before ob&s;erved, it is wonderful that we have any ancient geography at all; but not &s;o that what we have is full of errors. Ptolemy's geography of Germany and Gaul has great mi&s;takes; tho not &s;o ab&s;olutely
<PB N="229" REF="316">radical as that re&s;pecting Scotland. To Ptolemy the&s;e remote regions were Japans, and Americas; and, as we are daily rectifying errors in our geo|graphy of di&s;tant regions, it would be a miracle indeed if the ancients, who wanted all our in&s;tru|ments and &s;kill, had not fallen into errors. Pto|lemy's de&s;criptions of Scotland and Ireland were certainly like our de&s;criptions of Japan, China, Kamchatka, &amp;c. derived from merchants and travellers; and the countries being &s;eldom vi&s;$$ed, many mi&s;takes would of cour&s;e creep in.</P>
<P>In Ptolemy's geography of Scotland, the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, German Oceans, wa&s;hes it's ea&s;t &s;ide, in which oppo&s;ite <HI>Taixalium pr$montorium,</HI> lye the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, or Three Iles of the Saxons; which Claudian, as above mentioned, confounded with the Orkneys, tho they were on the coa&s;t of pre&s;ent Jutland. The <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, or Orkneys, are rightly placed to the north of Scotland, in the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, or Deucaledonian ocean, which Ptolemy tells us el&s;ewhere was the &s;ame with the Sarmatic, or Baltic, the ea&s;t part of which lay on the north of the Sarmatae. In this Ocean above the Orkneys, Ptolemy places Thule, a mere vi&s;ionary country, which vani&s;hed and withdrew to the north, as di&s;covery advanced. Ireland, Shetland, Scandinavia, and perhaps Ice|land, were re&s;pectively called Thule at different times. To the we&s;t of Scotland Ptolemy rightly places the Hebud Iles; <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>Ebuda,</HI> or Lewis; <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>Ebuda major,</HI> or Skey; <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>Maleus,</HI> or Mull; and <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>Epidium,</HI> or Jura and Ila, which Ptolemy, not knowing the nar|row &s;trait between them, thought but one ile: and <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>Ricina,</HI> or Rachlin, on the north of Ireland. To the &s;outh of the&s;e he places <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, Monaeda, or the Ile of Maun. All the&s;e lye in the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>Oceanus Hibernicus,</HI> or Iri&s;h Ocean. Richard in one of his dreams has ignorantly placed the Oceanus Deucaledonius on the we&s;t of Scot|land,
<PB N="230" REF="317" MS="Y">not knowing that Ptolemy, lib. VII. had expre&s;&s;ly called it the &s;ame with the <HI>Oceanus Sar|maticus,</HI> or Baltic; which lyes to the north, and not to the we&s;t of Scotland: and no one will pre|fer the error of a blundering monk of the Four|teenth century, to Ptolemy's po&s;itive authority.

<P>ONE of the greate&s;t philo&s;ophers, and wi&s;e&s;t men, whom modern times have produced, has enquired into the rea&s;on why mankind are &s;o fond of fal&s;ehood, as generally to prefer it to truth. He ju&s;tly ob&s;erves that this is owing to the greater decoration, the meretricious ornaments, which fal&s;ehood ever bears; while truth, &s;imple and plain, has no charms for the general eye. Truth, he &s;ays, is like open day-light, which does not &s;how the ma&s;ques and mummeries of the world, in &s;o gaudy a trim as the candle-light of fal&s;ehood<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Lord Bacon, E&s;&s;ays, I. <HI>On Truth.</HI></NOTE>. In another place he mo&s;t ju&s;tly remarks that, 'there is in human nature generally more of the fool, than of the wi&s;e: and therefore tho&s;e faculties, by which the fooli&s;h part of mens minds is taken, is the mo&s;t potent.' Indeed this weakne&s;s is common to the wi&s;e&s;t of us: and thence it is, that owing to our natural love of fal&s;ehood, all human hi&s;tory is ju&s;tly thought, by many thinking men, to con|tain an infinitely greater number of fables, than of truth. <HI>L'Hi&s;toire n'e&s;t qu'une fable convenue,</HI> &s;ays Fontenelle. Men are hard as marble to truth; but &s;oft as wax to every impre&s;&s;ion of fal&s;ehood.</P>
<P>Now, in all philo&s;ophy, there cannot be a more infallible axiom, than this, that WHENEVER ANY FALSEHOOD IS RECEIVED AS TRUTH, THE OPPOSITE TRUTH MUST OF ABSOLUTE NECESSITY PASS FOR
<PB N="232" REF="319" MS="Y">FALSEHOOD. Thus the &s;pherical figure of the earth; the Copernican &s;y&s;tem; the plurality of worlds; were all regarded as quite fal&s;e, till cer|tified beyond a doubt; and then the oppo&s;ite opinions became quite fal&s;e. And, in hi&s;tory, &s;o long as the voyage of Francus into France, and that of Brutus into Britain, were received as truths, the real truth was e&s;teemed complete fal&s;ehood.</P>
<P>What France was two centuries ago, in regard to it's antiquities; and England was one century ago; &s;uch is Scotland now: lo&s;t in fable; and regarding the truth as fal&s;ehood. No childi&s;h fiction can be more ab&s;olutely &s;hewn to be fal&s;e, than the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of kings of the Scots, from Fergus I. more than 400 years before Chri&s;t, to Fergus II. 503 after him. It will afterward be demon&s;trated, as far as hi&s;toric demon&s;tration can go, that the Old Scots, or Dalriads, far from being conquerors of the Piks in 843, were them|&s;elves &s;ubdued by the Piks in 739, according to the Annals of Tighernac and Ul&s;ter, the mo&s;t authentic Iri&s;h documents; and which cer|tainly favour the Dalriads more than the Piks, as the former were from Ireland. That the kingdom of Dalriada, upon it's conque&s;t by the Piks, in 739, vani&s;hes from hi&s;tory, and dwindles into nullity; which could never have been the ca&s;e, had it grown in power, &s;o as in 843 to vanqui&s;h the Piks. That Kenneth, noted in our fables, as conqueror of the Piks, was real and immediate king of tho&s;e very Piks, whom we dream that he conquered. That the modern names of Scots, and Scotland, unknown for the people and country of North Britain, till the year 1010, or 1020, did not ari&s;e at all from the Dal|riads, or Old Briti&s;h Scots of Beda; who, on the contrary, had lo&s;t the name of Scots, for &s;ome centuries before; and were called <HI>Gatheli,</HI> and <HI>Hibernen&s;es,</HI> as terms of &s;pecial di&s;tinction, from the modern SCOTI, a name given to the
<PB N="233" REF="320">Piks by later Celtic writers, as being <HI>Scythae,</HI> or <HI>Goths,</HI> as were al&s;o the <HI>Old Scoti</HI> of Ireland. That the cau&s;e of all this confu&s;ion in our hi&s;tory ari&s;es from Iri&s;h churchmen, being our only literati, and hi&s;torians, in the Eleventh and Twelfth cen|turies, when this confu&s;ion begins to appear; and from other rea&s;ons after explained. That till Kenneth mounted the Piki&s;h throne, the Dal|riads were confined to Argyle&s;hire; and did not reach over the other Highlands of Inverne&s;s and Ro&s;s-&s;hires till centuries after; nor into Suther|land, till the Norwegians left that country. That they never, from their arrival, till this hour, ex|ceeded 300,000; while the Piks, the real people of pre&s;ent Scotland, now amount to 1,000,000, and always were to the Dalriads as three to one. And that the line of Dalriadic princes, or Scoti&s;h Kings, as we dream, even from 503, to the time Kenneth came to the Piki&s;h crown, in 843, is totally vague, and un&s;atisfactory, as might be expected in &s;uch a petty monarchy, or rather dukedom.</P>
<P>Yet &s;o great is the propen&s;ion of the generality to fal&s;ehood, that the people of Scotland plume and pique them&s;elves upon childi&s;h fables con|cerning the Old Scots, or Dalriads, while the Piki&s;h kingdom, &s;o remarkable in the pages of Beda, almo&s;t pa&s;&s;es for a dream! It was not till this century that the Engli&s;h, &s;o &s;uperior to us in antiquaries, di&s;covered that they had no concern with Brutus, and the Welch fables. The Welch are to the Engli&s;h what the Dalriads, or High|landers, are to the people of North Britain: but with this prodigious difference, that the Welch were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of England before the ance&s;tors of the pre&s;ent Engli&s;h; while the Dalriads did not arrive in North Britain till many centuries after the Piks, the real ance&s;tors of the people. The change of the name Piks into that of Scots has occa&s;ioned deplorable confu&s;ion in our hi&s;tory. Yet it is in detecting and
<PB N="234" REF="321">&s;ettling &s;uch &s;ingular events that the abilities of an antiquary are chiefly to be exerted. The&s;e two words <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> have hitherto totally ruined our hi&s;tory; but in time truth and good &s;en&s;e will prevail. To the&s;e terms is it owing that we of Scotland are to this day enemies of the Piks; and that our whole antiqui&s;ts are propagating fal&s;ehood, in order to de&s;troy the hi&s;tory of our ance&s;tors!</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s with &s;hame that the&s;e prejudices clung around me at fir&s;t; and that it was &s;ome time before i could throw a candid eye upon the Piki&s;h hi&s;tory. After i clearly &s;aw that the Piks were the real ance&s;tors of the pre&s;ent Scots, i looked upon the catalogues of Piki&s;h kings given by Fordun, Winton, Lynch, and Innes, with a &s;u&s;picious eye; and thought the account of Old Scoti&s;h kings better authenticated. As i went deeper into the &s;ubject, i &s;aw more and more un|certainty attending the li&s;t of Old Scoti&s;h kings, even from 503 to 843; and new circum&s;tances to certify the &s;eries of Piki&s;h monarchs. Upon a careful peru&s;al of many ancient hi&s;torians of Den|mark, Norway, and Sweden, i &s;aw no better evi|dences of their old monarchs preceding the Tenth century than of our Piki&s;h kings. At la&s;t i began, to a&s;k my&s;elf &s;eriou&s;ly by what unaccountable pre|judices it came to pa&s;s that i looked upon the Piki&s;h &s;eries with quite another eye, than upon tho&s;e of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, which are no better authenticated? If any in&s;tance had occurred, or could po&s;&s;ibly occur, of four different li&s;ts of kings being all forged, and yet agreeing with Beda, the Iri&s;h and Welch Annals, nay in one in|&s;tance with a German annali&s;t? If Scaliger, Peta|vius, or other chronologi&s;ts, had better authority for many li&s;ts of kings, given by them from one &s;ingle writer, and univer&s;ally received by the learned, than we for the &s;eries of Piki&s;h monarchs? How it could come to pa&s;s that the li&s;t of petty
<PB N="235" REF="322">kings of Dalriada could be pre&s;erved, and that of the monarchs of all North Britain peri&s;h, while the Old Scots were not Chri&s;tians, even in Ireland, till 432, and the Southern Piks were converted, as Beda &s;hews, about 412; &s;o that the advantage of the light of Chri&s;tianity was on the Piki&s;h &s;ide? What four forgers could ari&s;e, &s;o &s;kilful as to follow exactly Beda's account of the Piki&s;h elective &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, that it was in the female, and not in the male line? To an&s;wer the&s;e que&s;tions, and others of the &s;ame tendency, was to me utterly im|po&s;&s;ible, &s;o i willingly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed my prejudices; and repo&s;ed my mind on the truth, that we have as complete evidence of our Piki&s;h kings, of the kings of all Scotland, from the Fifth to the Ninth century, as human hi&s;tory affords in &s;uch ca&s;es: and that the &s;eries from the Fi&s;rt century to the Fifth is equal, as that from the Fifth to the Ninth is &s;uperior, to tho&s;e of Denmark, Sweden, or Norway, during that whole period of the eight fir&s;t centuries. In &s;hort it was di&s;covered that the only cau&s;e why the Piki&s;h &s;eries has been neglected by our hi&s;torians, fal&s;ely &s;o called; and, of cour&s;e, by our people in general; was the grand axiom above mentioned, WHENEVER ANY FALSEHOOD IS RECEIVED AS TRUTH, THE OPPOSITE TRUTH MUST OF ABSOLUTE NECESSITY PASS FOR FALSEHOOD. The Old Scoti&s;h &s;eries, and the whole childi&s;h hi&s;tory of the Old Scots, are as arrant fal&s;ehoods as ever folly propagated, and ignorance believed; and when the&s;e were received as truth, the Piki&s;h &s;eries, and the real and &s;olid hi&s;tory of the Piks, to be found in the Roman and other grave wri|ters, of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity pa&s;&s;ed for fal&s;ehoods.</P>
<P>The rea&s;ons why the Scoti&s;h fables prevailed over the Piki&s;h hi&s;tory it is ea&s;y to offer. Innes has &s;hewn that, down to the year 1291, the Piki&s;h &s;eries was carefully pre&s;erved, and given by our chroniclers; who rightly commenced the Dalriadic &s;eries only at 503; and re&s;trained their power to
<PB N="236" REF="323">Dalriada, or Argyle, till 843, when, by their ac|counts, they a&s;cended the Piki&s;h throne. In 1291 the grand di&s;pute with Edward I. of England aro&s;e; and the Highland bards and genealogi&s;ts having, with their u&s;ual idioti&s;m and venality, flat|tered their chiefs and di&s;trict &s;o far at the expence of all truth, as to begin, in the dark ignorance of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, to a&s;&s;ert that their own Dalriadic race had come to the Piki&s;h throne by conque&s;t; nay that the Dalriads had vanqui&s;hed the Piks &s;even times in a day, and af|terward devoured the whole nation at an entertain|ment<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Convocatos itaque, tanquam ad convivium, magnates Pic|torum, captata crapulae opportunitate, clavorum extractione quos tenebant tabulata in bancorum concavitate, mira deci|pula, poplitenus comiter et improvi&s;e lap&s;os, &s;tatim trucida|verunt.

For the Engli&s;h having no idea what the extirpation of a people could mean, and being mere &s;trangers to the bloody lunacy of Highland bards had, in|&s;tead of extirpating the Britons in a dream, with their u&s;ual good &s;en&s;e, availed them&s;elves of the&s;e very Britons to advance their claim of great anti|quity, in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this iland. Edward commenced with Brutus; and claimed by &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion of the Engli&s;h to the Welch line. This was &s;en&s;e, and policy, for that age: but there is a quality called folly, which is thought to be directly oppo&s;ite to &s;en&s;e. The idioti&s;m of the Highland bards had annihilated the Piks, &s;o that the nominal Scots had no claim of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Their only claim was that of extirpation; a claim &s;o truly Celtic, that it could not have entered a cold
<PB N="237" REF="324">Gothic head. 'Extirpation!' would the Pope and Cardinals have &s;aid, <Q>there is no &s;uch word &startq;in human hi&s;tory, ancient or modern. To ex|tirpate the people, among whom an idea of &s;uch brutal madne&s;s could ari&s;e, would be an office of &endq;humanity.</Q> To veil therefore this unheard-of claim, the hi&s;tory of the Piks was totally &s;unk; and the Scots were a&s;&s;erted to have been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the country, by their name of Scots, from the fifth century before Chri&s;t. Hence &s;prung the ut|ter ruin of the hi&s;tory of Scotland. And to the brutal frenzy of the Highland bards and &s;enachies are we indebted for it. Had the &s;malle&s;t ray of common &s;en&s;e glanced acro&s;s their decea&s;ed minds, they mu&s;t have &s;een that on the Piki&s;h hi&s;tory alone did the whole honour of their line &s;tand: and that their &s;illy antiquities were but as ivy round the Piki&s;h column, which, if the column fell, would fall with it. The manife&s;to of the Scoti&s;h lords to the Pope, in 1291, is well known to be the &s;ole ba&s;is of our fabulous hi&s;tory: and from 1291 to this hour, being Five Centuries, has our ancient hi&s;tory remained a Celtic dream, to the laughter and a&s;toni&s;hment of all Europe.

Such are the fruits of folly, and fal&s;ehood; while had the Highland bards and &s;enachies pre|&s;erved, and &s;edulou&s;ly cultivated, the Piki&s;h hi&s;|tory, and been even content with a&s;&s;erting that
<PB N="238" REF="325" MS="Y">the Dalriadic, or Old Scoti&s;h line came by inheri|tance to the Piki&s;h kingdom; the&s;e Scoti&s;h lords them&s;elves, in fact all Piks, as three quarters of the people were and are, would have plumed them|&s;elves upon the Piki&s;h hi&s;tory; and might, from the Iri&s;h annals, have &s;hewn, if they plea&s;ed, that the monarchy was older than Brutus; and from Beda, that the Piks po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed their part of Britain, as early as the Welch did theirs. If the Scoti&s;h. line came to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion &s;o late as 843, the line then on the throne of England came in &s;o late as 1154, for the hou&s;e of Plantagenet then a&s;cended the Engli&s;h throne, by the &s;ame right as &s;ome writers &s;ay the Scoti&s;h race a&s;cended the Piki&s;h, namely, female inheritance. But the fal&s;ehoods of the Scoti&s;h manife&s;to &s;erved not one purpo&s;e that the truth would not have &s;erved in a far higher degree. Indeed, it was only one word which cau&s;ed all this fal&s;ehood and frenzy. Had the old name of the country, Pikland, been re|tained, the madne&s;s of the Highland bards would never have been infectious. If William the Con|queror had changed the name of England to Normandy, not all the &s;uperior clearne&s;s of Engli&s;h hi&s;tory could have prevented &s;hocking mi&s;takes.</P>
<P>Setting this weakne&s;s entirely a&s;ide, it is certain that three quarters of the pre&s;ent Scots are Piks; and that the only hi&s;tory of Scotland is that of Pikland. The &s;lighte&s;t enquiry into the &s;ubject convinced me, that to write our hi&s;tory, as done for the&s;e five centuries, by arranging it under the line of Scoti&s;h princes, fal&s;ely &s;o called, is as ab|&s;urd, as it would be to write that of England under the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of kings of Wales. Win|ton indeed &s;aw this &s;o early as 1410; and has given our hi&s;tory under the Piki&s;h &s;overeigns. The Piki&s;h kings were the kings of North Bri|tain. The Old Scoti&s;h kings were the princes of Argyle, till 843, when Kenneth a&s;cended the
<PB N="239" REF="326" MS="Y">Piki&s;h throne. Such being the ca&s;e, the plan of con&s;tructing our hi&s;tory, which fir&s;t occurred to me, was to give no &s;eries of monarchs whatever till 843, but from the Roman writers, Beda, Iri&s;h Annals, &amp;c. to give every circum&s;tance that could be recovered. As i have no particular af|fection for kings, the want of a &s;eries of them gave a no concern; tho the hi&s;tory would, in this ca&s;e, have had an a&s;pect not &s;o complete, as that of other European kingdoms. But upon full examination of the &s;ubject it was clearly &s;een that the &s;eries of Piki&s;h kings was better authenticated, than tho&s;e of the Dani&s;h, Norwegian, and Swedi&s;h &s;overeigns of the time; as might naturally be ex|pected in a country which became Chri&s;tian in the fifth and &s;ixth centuries, while Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, were not &s;o till the tenth; and had no writers till the Eleventh, while Scot|land had Iri&s;h writers, Cuminius and Adomnan, in the &s;eventh, be&s;ide it's con&s;tant intercour&s;e with the learned countries of England and Ireland. It was al&s;o &s;een that the &s;eries of Dani&s;h kings was contained in old catalogues exactly &s;imilar to tho&s;e of our Piki&s;h monarchs; and which it was u&s;ual to keep in old calendars, and ma&s;s-books. Had the Piki&s;h &s;eries peri&s;hed, it would have been in|deed a miracle; but that it is pre&s;erved and is confirmed by the collateral evidences of Cuminius, Adomnan, Beda, the Iri&s;h annali&s;ts, and others, is no matter of wonder. Soon after Fordun's book appeared in print, 1684, Sir George Mackenzie's mad vi&s;ions, about the antiquity of the Scoti&s;h line, rai&s;ed a &s;ingular party heat in Scotland, that, like a furnace, burned the mo&s;t &s;olid proofs of truth to a&s;hes. At the time of the Union, &s;ome hot Engli&s;h writers moved que&s;tions concerning the independency of Scotland; and tho all men of &s;en&s;e and &s;cience in the later country began to open their eyes to the fal&s;ehood of our hi&s;tory, &s;o clearly evinced by U&s;her, Bi&s;hop
<PB N="240" REF="327" MS="Y">Lloyd, and Stillingfleet, yet that the country had always been independent, was a certain truth, (now univer&s;ally allowed by Engli&s;h hi&s;|&s;torians): but this point being of &s;upreme delicacy and importance, there was great hazard in changing the grounds of our hi&s;tory at that time. And as Atwood, and other writers again&s;t the independency of Scotland, had availed them|&s;elves of charters, &s;ince demon&s;trated by Ry|mer and others to be palpable forgeries; the Scoti&s;h writers had a political right, in a political que&s;tion, to u&s;e their own old forgeries on the other extreme. This ferment was not forgotten, when Innes's valuable E&s;&s;ay on our old hi&s;tory ap|peared in 1729. That work contained &s;uch proo&s;s, as ought in&s;tantly to have turned the current of our hi&s;tory: but his own gro&s;s errors, concerning the Piks, whom with Camden and Lloyd he thought Welch Britons, rendered the accuracy of his other rea&s;ons &s;u&s;picious to men of reading, who knew this to be a new and futile opinion, directly oppo&s;ite to all ancient accounts. Innes being al&s;o a papi&s;t and violent Jacobite, his work became on the&s;e accounts little acceptable, and almo&s;t neglected. Our old hi&s;tory &s;ince that time has only fallen into the weak and ignorant di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of a Maitland, and a Guthrie; but even they begin to &s;hew faint gleams of common &s;en&s;e. So late indeed as 1759, Goodal, a hot-brained bigot, wi&s;hed to reduce all our hi&s;tory to it's old barba|ri&s;m and ignorance, by his &s;uperficial introduction to Fordun; a piece which would have di&s;graced a crazy monk of the twelfth century, and in which all hi&s;toric evidence is attempted to be melted down in the aquafortis of di&s;tempered zeal. The two Macpher&s;ons, con&s;idering them&s;elves of the old Highland race, have opened their mouths, and, like &s;enachies as they are, &s;wallowed up the Piks, and their hi&s;tory at one mouthful: not by annihilating the nation, for that would not do in
<PB N="241" REF="328">the pre&s;ent century, but (what is far wor&s;e, and yet more cruel) by converting the Piks into Celts, and denying all the Piki&s;h hi&s;tory; as it is indeed the grand characteri&s;tic of the Celts to put fal&s;ehood as truth, and truth as fal&s;ehood<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Dr. Macpher&s;on attempts to &s;hew the names of Piki&s;h kings Celtic; and in&s;tances the following; <HI>Cineoch,</HI> or <HI>Kenneth; Oen|gus,</HI> or <HI>Angus; Ennegus,</HI> or <HI>Hungus; Elpin,</HI> or <HI>Alpin; Urgus,</HI> or <HI>Fergus; Canaul,</HI> or <HI>Conal; Donel,</HI> or <HI>Donald:</HI> that is from 100 names, he can only pitch on &s;even or eight, and tho&s;e he is forced to grant are after Chri&s;tianity appeared in Pikland. But his error lyes in &s;uppo&s;ing the Dalriadic line Celtic, whereas it was Gothic; and the names are Gothic, as the reader will &s;ee after. Sir Robert Sibbald, in his Hi&s;tory of Fife, has long ago ob&s;erved that the names of Piki&s;h kings are Gothic, not Iri&s;h; and Dr. Macpher&s;on's &s;ad &s;hift of mangling &s;even names, even to make that number Iri&s;h, &s;hews the truth; tho Dr. M. did not know it. Dr. M. al&s;o p. 42, 43, fights again&s;t the Piki&s;h li&s;t preceding Brudi, 557; and &s;ays why receive it, when the &s;ame fragments, which pre&s;erve it, may al&s;o &s;erve to e&s;tabli&s;h the Scoti&s;h kings before Fergus, &s;on of Ere? <HI>The very rever&s;e of this is the truth;</HI> for tho&s;e fragments, which pre|&s;erve the Piki&s;h li&s;t, have not one of the&s;e Scoti&s;h kings, but begin every one with Fergus, &s;on of Ere, as the fir&s;t Scoti&s;h king. This man was a doctor of divinity; and yet, if he had u&s;ed the &s;ame freedom in a private bu&s;ipe&s;s, which he has in hi&s;tory, he would have been &s;et in the pillory. He al&s;o &s;ays, p. 16, that the Chronicles, publi&s;hed by Innes, only reconcile us to the lo&s;s of the re&s;t: and it is no wonder that a true highlander &s;hould eagerly wi&s;h for the de&s;truction of all our hi&s;toric remains, in order to make O&s;&s;ian and fal&s;ehood trium|phant.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But, ever &s;ince Innes publi&s;hed the two old Piki&s;h Chronicles, all men of &s;en&s;e and &s;cience in Scotland have &s;een that upon them, and their collateral proofs, the whole &s;eries of the kings of North Britain preceding 843 &s;tands. The peo|ple of Scotland, &s;eeing the gro&s;s folly and fal&s;e|hood of our antiqui&s;ts, have been content to &s;tand aloof, and laugh, being &s;ick of the old non&s;en&s;e; while no writer has ari&s;en willing to undergo the va&s;t toil of fixing our antiquities upon a firm ba&s;is. Our men of talents have never been antiquaries; and &s;uch a line of dunces have di&s;cu&s;&s;ed our anti|quities,
<PB N="242" REF="329">that it is no wonder the &s;tudy of them is di&s;e&s;teemed; and that a country, productive of able writers, is remarkable for that mo&s;t contemptible of all kinds of ignorance, the ignorance of it's own hi&s;tory. The want of public libraries in Scotland is one great cau&s;e of this; and the in&s;titution of &s;uch would contribute more to the real learning of the country, than the founda|tion of univer&s;ities: for tho&s;e who have the u&s;e of libraries generally want inclination; and the grand point is to open up to inclination, which alone carries a man thro the toils of learning, ea&s;y means of indulgence.</P>
<P>Let us now proceed to a particular con&s;ideration of the catalogues we have of our Piki&s;h monarchs. If the reader be accu&s;tomed to the Scoti&s;h hi&s;|tory, as it &s;tands preceding 843, he may, it is likely, receive the plain truths here pre&s;ented with a prejudiced and reluctant ear. Nothing is &s;o mad as prejudice: and national prejudices, re|ceived for Five Centuries, form &s;uch a confirmed frenzy, as perhaps other five centuries might, in &s;ome countries, be required to remove. But much may be tru&s;ted to that good &s;en&s;e which is &s;hewn by my countrymen in other affairs; and it is to that good &s;en&s;e i appeal: and have &s;o high an opinion of its general operation, even in &s;o ob|&s;tinate a ca&s;e as this, that i &s;hould not be &s;ur|prized to &s;ee even our &s;hallowe&s;t writers following the true path, in a very few years. If the reader does not drop old prejudices, the ca&s;e is de&s;perate; for God knows that, after all prejudices are put a&s;ide, human rea&s;on is but a weak affair, and the love of truth no &s;trong motive with mankind. All that is reque&s;ted of the reader is to follow Lord Bacon's coun&s;el in &s;earching after truth, 'to keep his mind in &s;u&s;pence, till he re&s;olve:' and to take up this examination, as the author has done, as a que&s;tion concerning an ancient &s;eries of kings of Macedon, Egypt, A&s;&s;yria, or of Norway,
<PB N="243" REF="330">Sweden, or Denmark. The Catalogues we have of our Piki&s;h kings amount to no le&s;s than Five; and are as follow.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. One given by Fordun, who wrote about 1385; and who does not mention whence he had it. This however agrees &s;o well with Adomnan and Beda, that it would, if &s;olitary, &s;atisfy every unprejudiced mind: and Langbaine<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Chron. Reg. Pict. in his <HI>Elenchus Ant. Albion, una cum brevi Regum Pictorum Chronico.</HI> Londini, 1673, 8vo.</NOTE> has thought this alone a &s;ufficient foundation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. Winton's account of the Piki&s;h kings, woven into his Chronicle, written about 1410.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. A catalogue of the Piki&s;h kings from Bru|di, 557, publi&s;hed by Lynch, in his <HI>Cambren&s;is Ever&s;us,</HI> from an ancient Iri&s;h tran&s;lation of Nen|nius.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. A catalogue publi&s;hed by Innes, from the <HI>Regi&s;trum Sancti Andreae,</HI> written 1251.</ITEM>
<ITEM>V. The mo&s;t complete, important, and au|thentic, is the CHRONICON REGUM PICTORUM, publi&s;hed by Innes, from a MS. in the Colbertine, and now in the king of France's library, written in the Fourteenth century; but perhaps this part tran&s;cribed from one of the Ninth. This MS. was formerly in the collection of Cecil Lord Bun|leigh; is now in the French king's library, N^o 4126; and the reader will find it's contents in the Appendix,</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>All the&s;e catalogues differ in &s;ome few points; a clear proof that not one of them was tran&s;cribed from any of the others. The&s;e variations will be marked in the next chapter. The mo&s;t remark|able is that I, II, and IV, out off no le&s;s than FOURTEEN kings, between <HI>Cruthen</HI> the fir&s;t, and <HI>Gilgidi</HI> the &s;ixteenth, but whom they make the &s;econd. For this the Scoti&s;h tran&s;cribers had two rea&s;ons.
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. By thus reducing the number of Piki&s;h kings, they abridged the date of the Piki&s;h
<PB N="244" REF="331">monarchy, and made it po&s;terior to the imaginary aera of the Scoti&s;h.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>Brudi Bout,</HI> the 15th king, is &s;aid in the genuine Chronicle to have been the progenitor of thirty &s;overeigns of Ireland, which could only be by conque&s;t;</ITEM>
</LIST>
and the Iri&s;h origin of the Old Scots, being anciently as cer|tain, and well known, as the light of day, the Scoti&s;h tran&s;cribers could not hear of this a&s;&s;ertion, &s;o da&s;hed out this monarch and his predece&s;&s;ors, all &s;ave Cruthen, who was &s;o well known as the fir&s;t Piki&s;h &s;overeign, that the Iri&s;h called the Piks <HI>Cruthenich,</HI> after his name; as they called the Dalreudini from Reuda, and applied many other names of kings to different tribes and nations. But that Number V. as it is the mo&s;t full and com|plete in all re&s;pects, &s;o is al&s;o the mo&s;t authentic, Innes has &s;hewn by the&s;e arguments.</P>
<P N="1">I. The number of kings from Cruthen to Con|&s;tantin, is by the mo&s;t ancient Iri&s;h annals &s;aid to amount to Seventy. This is exactly the number in this invaluable record; while, by the li&s;t given by Fordun, they are but Fifty-eight; by Winton's account, which is quite imperfect, &s;till fewer; and by the Regi&s;ter of St. Andrew's, only Fifty-two.</P>
<P N="2">II. This Catalogue alone perfectly coincides with other authentic writers, while the others differ widely. Beda informs us, that the year of Chri&s;t 565 concurred with the Ninth year of Brudi, &s;on of Meilochon, king of the Piks. Thence it follows that Brudi began his reign in the year 557; and this is a fixt and important epoch, to which all the other reigns may be referred.</P>
<P N="1">1. All writers agree with Beda, that, in 685, Egfrid, king of Northumberland, was &s;lain in battle by the Piks; and the ancient additions to Nennius &s;ay it was by Brudi, king of the Piks, that Egfrid was killed. Now by this Chronicle, the reign of Brudi, &s;on of Bili, began 676, and ended 697. While, by Fordun's li&s;t, this king
<PB N="245" REF="332">began to reign in 660, and reigned only eleven years, or till 671.</P>
<P N="2">2. Ceolfrid, abbot of Wiremouth, wrote his famous letter about Ea&s;ter, and the Ton&s;ure, to Naitan, king of the Piks in 715. <HI>Beda.</HI> And this agrees perfectly with the chronology of this chroni|cle, according to which Naitan, &s;on of Derili, or Nethan III. reigned from 712 till 727. While, by Fordun's catalogue, Naitan ended his reign in 703; and by the Regi&s;ter of St. Andrew's did not begin to reign till 747. So that they mu&s;t be both wrong, and the Chronicle alone exact.</P>
<P N="3">3. The death of Ungu&s;t, &s;on of Vergu&s;t, king of the Piks, is fixt to the year 761, by a &s;hort Chronicle at the end of Beda, and by Roger Hove|den, and Simeon of Durham. Now this agrees exactly with this Piki&s;h Chronicle; according to the &s;upputation of which the death of Ungu&s;t happened ju&s;t that year 761. While by Fordun's catalogue, it would have been 737; and by the Regi&s;ter of St. Andrew's, about the year 800.</P>
<P N="4">4. Kineod, king of the Piks, gave a retreat in his kingdoms to Alcred, king of Northumberland, expelled from his throne in 774, according to Roger Hoveden, and Simeon of Durham. The very name of this Kineod is not to be found in any of the catalogues, &s;ave this, and the one given by Lynch. And in this Chronicle the death of Kineod is placed in 775, in which Roger and Si|meon al&s;o agree.</P>
<P>The&s;e arguments, invincible as truth, mu&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h the great fidelity and authenticity of this Chronicle beyond all po&s;&s;ibility of doubt, even with the mo&s;t ignorant and prejudiced. Upon this Chronicle alone then mu&s;t our &s;eries of Piki&s;h kings be given; and all the re&s;t be referred to it, as an infallible &s;tandard. This &s;hall be done in the next chapter: but, before proceeding further, as, in &s;o e&s;&s;ential a point as the &s;eries of Piki&s;h monarchs, the kings of North Britain, no &s;hadow of doubt &s;hould be left, a few arguments &s;hall be
<PB N="246" REF="333">offered for the authenticity of this &s;eries. No one, who&s;e mind is not blinded by prejudice, can indeed que&s;tion a &s;eries of monarchs e&s;tabli&s;hed in general by no le&s;s than Five Chronicles, all bearing intrin&s;ic marks that they are not copied from each other; nor from any forged archetype; but the following con&s;iderations are offered, which, it is hoped, may remove all prejudice. For to him, who looks into the&s;e monuments with the &s;ame freedom of mind that is applied to a li&s;t of Ma|cedonian or A&s;&s;yrian kings, the only wonder will be what di&s;tempered fancy could &s;ugge&s;t a doubt on the occa&s;ion. That he who believes in the Scoti&s;h &s;eries will not credit the Piki&s;h, that a believer in O&s;&s;ian will not credit authentic records, is indeed a natural con&s;equence. For to weak minds, by a perver&s;ion of mental vi&s;ion, truth &s;eems fal&s;ehood, and fal&s;ehood truth: and it is ever found that WHEN FALSEHOOD IS RECEIVED AS TRUTH, THE OPPOSITE TRUTH MUST OF ABSOLUTE NECESSITY PASS FOR FALSEHOOD.</P>
<P N="1">1. The rea&s;on why the Piki&s;h &s;eries has been neglected, is the change of the name of Piks for that of Scots in the eleven the century; and the fables which our Iri&s;h Chroniclers built upon that change. No Pik, or Lowlander, can be di&s;covered as a writer, till two centuries after this, when the very name of Pik and Pikland was lo&s;t in the pro|found gloom of that period; and in 1291 we find the name of Scots had &s;o far operated, that the Piks, or Lowlanders, were fighting like bedla|mites for the name of Old Scots, and gravely in|plying their own extirpation! Now to tru&s;t the&s;e Celtic &s;enachies with the real hi&s;tory of a country, would be as ab&s;urd as to &s;earch for the hi&s;tory of England in Geofrey of Monmouth. Truth and fal&s;ehood are totally heterogeneous; and as, in Geofrey of Monmouth, the real and &s;olid hi&s;tory of Britain is quite &s;unk, and a &s;eries of Celtic lyes given in place of it, that, by utterly extingui&s;hing the
<PB N="247" REF="334" MS="Y">hi&s;tory of the English, exalt the Welch, a poor confined race of conquered da&s;tards, to the greate&s;t glory, &s;uch was exactly the ca&s;e with our hi&s;tory. Alas, &s;uch actually it is! For let the reader &s;uppo&s;e for a moment that Beda, and the Saxon Chroni|cle, (only two little books), had peri&s;hed, as no other Engli&s;h hi&s;torians aro&s;e till the Twelfth cen|tury, Geofrey of Monmouth would infallibly have been followed in all things, as he really was in mo&s;t till this very century; and the hi&s;tory of England, had it not been for Beda alone, from whom the early part of the Saxon Chronicle is taken, would at this hour have been like the hi&s;|tory of Scotland, a mere Celtic dream. Pikland produced no Beda; and of &s;o va&s;t importance is literature to a country, that one literary man may, like a petty deity, give a whole nation fame, and it's con&s;tant attendants, power and dignity. And the want of one literary man may &s;ink a country in the eyes of all other nations; and reduce it to al|mo&s;t a non-exi&s;tence. What the Engli&s;h are to the Welch, &s;uch are the people of North Britain to the Highlanders. And as the real hi&s;tory of England has quite peri&s;hed, if regarded only in the Welch accounts; &s;o has our hi&s;tory in the High|land vi&s;ions.</P>
<P N="2">2. Beda tells us, that the Piki&s;h elective &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion of kings was in the female line, from all anti|quity, and retained to his time. This &s;ucce&s;&s;ion &s;hall be further con&s;idered afterward; but it &s;uf|fices here to remark, that by this mode no &s;on was &s;ucce&s;&s;or to his father; but the &s;i&s;ter's &s;on, daughter's &s;on, or next heir cho&s;en on the female &s;ide. Now the &s;eries of Piki&s;h kings fully accords with this account. To Dru&s;t, &s;on of Erp, &s;ucceeds Talorc, &s;on of Aniel, &amp;c. to Brudi, &s;on of Bili, &s;ucceeds Tharan, &s;on of Enti&s;idich; and to him Brudi, &s;on of Derili, &amp;c. To a free mind this minute, but important, coincidence mu&s;t afford an infalli|ble proof of veracity.</P>
<PB N="248" REF="335" MS="Y">
<P N="3">3. The catalogue of Piki&s;h monarchs, given by Lynch, from an old Iri&s;h MS. of Nennius, per|fectly agrees with the mo&s;t important Piki&s;h Chro|nicle, Number V, &s;ave that in one or two places the number of years a&s;&s;igned to a reign vary. The other catalogues all differ &s;o much among them|&s;elves, as to prove beyond a doubt that they could not be copied from each other; nor from one arche|type: and yet all agree &s;o far as fully to confirm the veracity of the whole &s;eries. Were any forgery in the ca&s;e, this could never have happened but by &s;pecial miracle; which it is humbly pre&s;umed no one will &s;uppo&s;e to have been wrought on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P N="4">4. The <HI>P&s;altair Ca&s;hail;</HI> a Metrical Chronicle of the kings of Dalriada, compo&s;ed by the bard, or &s;enachy of Malcolm III. 1056, as the conclu|&s;ion bears; the <HI>Leabhair Dromma&s;nacta;</HI> book of Lecan; and other Iri&s;h monuments; ALL agree that there were Seventy kings of the Piks pre|ceding Con&s;tantin. The invaluable catalogue, Number V, gives ju&s;t this number: and it al&s;o agrees in four grand epochs with Beda, Hoveden, Simeon of Durham, and other early Engli&s;h wri|ters; proofs of authenticity, which, in any other ca&s;e, would be held infallible: and which could not have happened in a forgery, &s;ave by a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of miracles. This piece mu&s;t, if a forgery, have been compo&s;ed either before, or after, the Twelfth century; when the greater number of the above authors appeared. If before, then they copied it; if after, the forger, who, as appears from his production, could hardly &s;pell a Latin word, was conver&s;ant in all the Iri&s;h and Engli&s;h hi&s;torians; and &s;o skilful as to accommodate his whole production to them. That the Iri&s;h Anna|li&s;ts, and Hoveden, and Simeon, followed this catalogue, and accommodated their narration, and dates to it, in events of which no ve&s;tige is to be found in it, the mo&s;t overheated imagina|tion
<PB N="249" REF="336">will never conceive. And that a forger &s;hould ari&s;e in the Fourteenth century, who had carefully &s;tudied unique Iri&s;h MSS, Beda, Simeon of Dur|ham, and Hoveden, and with an art, which has all the &s;implicity of truth, had adapted his whole &s;eries to the&s;e writers; nay to Four other Piki&s;h catalogues; is yet more impo&s;&s;ible than the former. But no man, who&s;e prejudices have not quite extingui&s;hed his rationality, can &s;uppo&s;e either of the&s;e ca&s;es. And the point comes at once to this i&s;&s;ue. Either this Piki&s;h Chronicle is a for|gery, and it's coincidences with the be&s;t and mo&s;t authentic writers, are miracles: or it is mo&s;t true and authentic; and it's coincidences with &s;uch wri|ters are natural, nece&s;&s;ary, and unavoidable. Let the reader chu&s;e; after taking this certain truth along with him, that all hi&s;toric forgeries, yet di&s;|covered, have violated chronology, and cla&s;hed with authentic authors; and that if this forgery alone had none of the&s;e marks, it would be a mira|cle; but that it alone confirms, and is confirmed by all authentic authors, who&s;e &s;ubject interferes, is &s;omething more miraculous than a miracle. If a foreigner happens to look into this work, he may with rea&s;on think meanly of the author's judgement, for in&s;i&s;ting on a matter which would appear &s;o clear at fir&s;t in the hi&s;tory of Denmark, Germany, Italy, Spain, France, or any country where ancient hi&s;tory is cultivated: but he will plea&s;e to reflect, that in Scotland ancient hi&s;tory is lo&s;t by the prejudices, fal&s;ehood, ignorance, and indolent &s;uperficiality, of our writers. And that with us the whole power of rea&s;oning mu&s;t be employed to e&s;tabli&s;h truth, which, in learned and unprejudiced countries, e&s;tabli&s;hes it&s;elf.</P>
<P N="5">5. We have FIVE Catalogues of Piki&s;h kings, ALL, tho different, confirming each other. Sca|liger, Petavius, and others of the greate&s;t learning and mo&s;t &s;evere judgement, have, in many ca&s;es, given a &s;eries of ancient kings, from only <HI>one</HI> li&s;t;
<PB N="250" REF="337">and that &s;eries has yet been univer&s;ally received, and pa&s;&s;es every where current as undoubted Hi&s;toric Truth. In the name of common &s;en&s;e, is one &s;ingle li&s;t, given by one &s;ingle author, who in &s;ome in&s;tances wrote a thou&s;and, or fifteen hun|dred years, after the &s;eries clo&s;ed, to be preferred to Five &s;everal li&s;ts, all confirming each other, and confirmed by authentic ancient authors; and written within four and five hundred years after the &s;eries clo&s;ed, nay according to all appearance tran&s;cribed from originals, written when the &s;eries exi&s;ted? For tho the Piks u&s;ed no letters, yet they had Welch and Iri&s;h churchmen among them, from the Fifth century, who did u&s;e letters.</P>
<P N="6">6. We mu&s;t deny all hi&s;toric evidence, if we deny the Piks to be Goths from Scandinavia. Now many of the names of Piki&s;h kings are the very &s;ame found in Runic monuments, and may be all traced in the Gothic, as i have e&s;pecially traced all their epithets in that language; for which &s;ee next chapter. This adds great authenticity to the CHRONICON PICTORUM.</P>
<P N="7">7. Tho the Danes and Swedes had no letters till the Tenth century, for the ridiculous antiquity a&s;&s;igned to the Runic monuments with in&s;criptions is now di&s;pelled<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Di&s;&s;ert de orig. Run. in Collect. Di&s;&s;. de Ant. Sueciae in Bibl. Regia. Runic letters were in common u&s;e in Scandinavia, &s;o late as the 15th century. Venantius Fortunatus, about 930, knew them in Gaul, whence they pa&s;&s;ed to Germany, but apparently did not reach Scandinavia till the Ninth cen|tury, at the &s;oone&s;t.</NOTE>, yet all allow the li&s;t of Dani&s;h and Swedi&s;h kings to be authentic from the Sixth century. How were they pre&s;erved? By &s;ongs and tales; by hi&s;toric bards, and genealogi&s;ts. That hi&s;toric &s;ongs were common among the German Goths, is clear from Tacitus<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Celebrant carminibus antiquis, quod unum apud illos memoriae et annalium genus e&s;t &amp;c. Tacit. Germ.</NOTE>. From &s;uch &s;ongs did Saxo Grammaticus compo&s;e his
<PB N="251" REF="338">hi&s;tory; and he produces them con&s;tantly as vouchers. But they are mingled with fiction, and Saxo's hi&s;tory of Hamlet immortali&s;ed by Shak&s;pere, and which by Saxo's account hap|pened before our aera, is palpably taken from a bal|lad, written not above fifty years before Saxo; for it mentions a wood between Scotland and England; and there was a &s;ea till after 1010, when the name of Scotland was fir&s;t given to North Britain. Saxo indeed, in another place, following a real old ballad, calls pre&s;ent Scotland <HI>Petia,</HI> or Petland<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Lib. IX. p. 171, edit. Steph. 'Scotiae ac Petiae,' that is Ireland and Pikland. He is &s;peaking of Regnar Lodbrog, about 830.</NOTE>. The danger therefore was that hi&s;toric &s;ongs were liable to be confounded with romantic ballads, as Saxo has done always. The true &s;eries of kings was that pre&s;erved by the genealogi&s;ts, who at coronations, and other &s;olemn events, repeated the &s;eries in barren ver&s;e, which only bore the names and years of the reign. The&s;e hi&s;toric li&s;ts are ea&s;ily known from this peculiarity, and their having no ornaments nor incidents whatever, as &s;hall be more fully mentioned pre&s;ently. They were in the Twelfth and Thirteenth centuries, when learning appeared in the northern kingdoms, as it then began to revive in others, tran&s;lated into Latin; or Latin catalogues made from them. The&s;e Latin catalogues, which in the Dani&s;h hi&s;|tory exactly re&s;emble the Scoti&s;h, have been care|fully collected, and e&s;teemed, as they are, the &s;ole foundations of the real hi&s;tory of the kingdoms. The late&s;t hi&s;torians follow them only; and reject the romances of Saxo, and others. Pikland was a kingdom at lea&s;t as powerful as ancient Denmark; and inhabited by the very &s;ame people. The &s;ame manners mu&s;t have prevailed; and the li&s;t of kings mu&s;t have, been con&s;tantly repeated and pre|&s;erved.

<PB N="252" REF="339">a written one, and more poli&s;hed than the Piki&s;h, an unwritten tongue: but the&s;e bards, accu&s;tomed only to the Dalriadic &s;eries, would continue to repeat it; as we find the bard of Malcolm III. do in the poem of this very kind, which is extant. And this bard contents him&s;elf with barely men|tioning that Seventy Piki&s;h kings had reigned over Pikland, from Cathluan, an epithetic name which the Iri&s;h writers give to Cruthen<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">So the Greeks, as Herodotus &s;ays, called the Candaules of the Lydians Myr&s;ilus.</NOTE>, the founder of the Piki&s;h monarchy, to Con&s;tantin. At the coronation of Alexander III. 1249, we find all mention of the Piki&s;h kings dropt; for a highlander on that occa&s;ion repeated the famous genealogy of that monarch in pro&s;e, which is pre|&s;erved by Diceto, Fordun, and others: in which he is traced in the Dalriadic line of kings. Thus were the highland &s;enachies, a &s;et of the mo&s;t ig|norant and crazy &s;trollers that ever di&s;graced a country, totally to bury our genuine hi&s;tory; and lay the foundation of that Celtic edifice of fal&s;ehood and non&s;en&s;e, which we call the ancient hi&s;tory of Scotland. Utter fal&s;ehood was received as truth; and the truth of con&s;equence began to pa&s;s for fal&s;ehood. But as the Danes in la&s;t century believed in Saxo, whom they had credited for Five Centuries, but now univer&s;ally allow five or &s;ix &s;hort li&s;ts of their old monarchs, exactly re&s;embling tho&s;e of our Piki&s;h kings, and but lately recovered, like the&s;e, from old manu&s;cripts, to be the &s;ole foundation of their genuine hi&s;tory, &s;uch will be our ca&s;e. And if a few Goodals in Scotland, and Ly&s;chanders in Denmark, ri&s;e to oppo&s;e forgery to truth, they will &s;oon &s;ink into utter contempt; for tho mankind are prone to fal&s;ehood, yet in all hi&s;tory truth has always prevailed in the end. Nor is it to be &s;uppo&s;ed that Scotland alone
<PB N="253" REF="340">will ever deny to found it's real hi&s;tory upon that broad and &s;olid ba&s;is of Gothic &s;en&s;e, and &s;obriety of mind, upon which that of other European kingdoms &s;tands; or be content along with the Welch and old Iri&s;h, in&s;tead of real antiquities, to hold out to the laughter and deri&s;ion of Europe a romance of Celtic non&s;en&s;e. Men who fo&s;ter &s;uch prejudices, are the bittere&s;t enemies of their country; for they keep it's hi&s;tory out of that of Europe: and no foreigner has meddled with our ancient hi&s;tory, or ever introduced it into univer&s;al hi&s;tory, or indeed ever mentioned it but with &s;corn.

<P N="9">9. The be&s;t catalogue of our Piki&s;h kings was found in a manu&s;cript which had belonged to Lord Burghley, and which, as it chiefly relates to Scoti&s;h affairs, had in all appearance been brought from Scotland. As it was written about the year 1350<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">See it's contents in the Appendix.</NOTE>, after the expeditions of Edward I. it &s;eems uncertain how it pa&s;&s;ed into England. The Re|gi&s;ter of St. Andrew's, in which another catalogue was found, ends 1251. Fordun's catalogue of Piki&s;h kings differs from both the&s;e, and could not be copied from either. Winton's differs from all the three; and is not copied from the Regi&s;ter of St. Andrew's, as Innes &s;ays, but was apparently taken from a MS. of the mona&s;tery in Lochleven, of which Winton was Prior; for Maul of Melgum, in his inaccurate history of the Piks, &s;ays he had his account of the Piki&s;h kings, from MSS. formerly belonging to St. Andrews, and Lochleven. The&s;e MSS. like &s;ome others which totally aboli&s;hed the Scoti&s;h antiquity, and e&s;tabli&s;hed that of the Piks, are &s;u&s;pected to have been wilfully de&s;troyed by frantic zeal for the Scoti&s;h <HI>name.</HI> Now all the&s;e Chronicles mu&s;t have been nece&s;&s;arily tran&s;cribed from ancient li&s;ts; for after the name of Scot|land was given to the country, about 1010, the Piki&s;h name gradually vani&s;hed. In 1138, at the War of the Standard, we find the la&s;t men|tion of the Piks in hi&s;tory; and the name was then confined to the people of Galloway, who, till that century, had been independant Piks un|der their own princes, the lords of Galloway, and thus had e&s;caped the denomination of Scots then given to the other Piks. After 1291 no nominal
<PB N="255" REF="342">Scoti&s;hman would have &s;ought to honour the Piks, tho his real ance&s;tors, at the expence of the Scots his name-fathers: far le&s;s have forged chro|nicles for that purpo&s;e. If the&s;e catalogues were forged, it mu&s;t have been in the Eleventh or Twelfth century, before the Piki&s;h name was lo&s;t, in the Scoti&s;h. And they could only be forged by Piks, who gloried in the name. Now let the reader conceive, if he can, four &s;uch &s;kilful for|gers to ari&s;e among the Piks, an illiterate people, as to compo&s;e the&s;e four catalogues, differing in them&s;elves, and yet agreeing &s;o far, as, with all the &s;implicity of truth, to e&s;tabli&s;h each other: and the be&s;t of them wholly confirmed by the Engli&s;h and Iri&s;h ancient authors. St. Andrew's and Lochleven were founded and protected by Piki&s;h kings; it was therefore mo&s;t natural that they &s;hould cheri&s;h the memory of their benefac|tors; and the finding catalogues of the&s;e kings, at the&s;e places, is a confirmation of their truth, at the &s;ame time that the Regi&s;ter of St. Andrew's, being written after the name of Scots had prevailed, we find the catalogue mutilated, and the victory of the Scots over the Piks a&s;&s;erted; a further confir|mation of it's truth to every unprejudiced mind. The book in which the real ancient Chronicle of the Piks, confirmed by the old Engli&s;h and Iri&s;h writers, as above &s;hewn, is pre&s;erved, i &s;u&s;pect to have belonged to &s;ome religious hou&s;e in Galloway, where the Piki&s;h name remained in full vigour in 1138, and to all appearance long after. And that this chronicle in particular is no forgery, has been fully &s;hewn above; not to mention that the intrin&s;ic evidence is very &s;trong, it's &s;implicity being extreme. Nay this very catalogue mu&s;t have been tran&s;cribed by &s;ome nominal Scoti&s;h|man, for in another place of the MS. he a&s;&s;erts the extermination of the Piks, by the Scots, and has a declamation again&s;t the &s;ins of the Piki&s;h nation, which brought them to this utter de&s;truc|tion.
<PB N="256" REF="343">Hence it is clear that it was not written by a nominal Pik; but tran&s;cribed from an older copy, like the other pieces in that collection, by &s;ome nominal Scoti&s;hman: and no Scoti&s;hman would forge a &s;eries of kings in which a Piki&s;h conque&s;t of Ireland was a&s;&s;erted; and &s;uch great antiquity given to the Piks above the Scots.</P>
<P N="10">10. The Southern Piks between the Forth and the Grampian hills, or of pre&s;ent Fife, Stirling, Dumbarton, Perth, Angus, and Mearns, by far the mo&s;t populous tract of Pikland, were con|verted to Chri&s;tianity, by St. Ninian, about 412, as Beda &s;hews. In 565 the Northern Piks were converted, as the &s;ame writer, Cuminius, Adomnan, and others, te&s;tify. The Chri&s;tianity of the Piks &s;eems indeed to have been dubious, and precarious; as that of the Scandinavians was for centuries after their conver&s;ion, tho &s;o late as the Tenth century. For there is not one Piki&s;h &s;aint, or churchman of any kind, on record, while Dalriada, Ireland, Wales, and England, were &s;warming with them. The &s;aints of England were indeed chiefly Welch and Iri&s;h, a race to who&s;e under&s;tandings the corrupt Chri&s;tianity of the dark ages was peculiarly adapted, and who carried fanatici&s;m to &s;uch ex|travagance as to pa&s;s for the mo&s;t holy and learned men that ever exi&s;ted. Nor is it matter of won|der that when frenzy was religion, and folly was learning, the Celts were the mo&s;t religious and learned people in the world. A con&s;ideration which e&s;capes tho&s;e who reflect not that the learn|ing then in vogue was ab&s;olute non&s;en&s;e; and affect to wonder that the aboriginal Iri&s;h, then &s;o famous for learning, have not produced one learned man &s;ince real learning revived. But tho we have innumerable lives of Iri&s;h and Welch &s;aints, who lived in England; yet we have none of any who lived in Pikland, for Ninian and Columba were only vi&s;itors. And tho we have Engli&s;h &s;aints; yet not one Piki&s;h &s;aint is known.
<PB N="257" REF="344">Had any &s;uch ari&s;en, they would never have wanted fame; for the Iri&s;h, Welch, or Engli&s;h, writers would certainly have pre&s;erved it. Had Chri&s;tianity flouri&s;hed in Pikland, it would certainly have introduced letters, as it did into every other country. Yet, while the Saxons, Welch, and Iri&s;h, wrote their own language, there &s;eems every rea&s;on to doubt if the Piki&s;h was ever a written language till, the Thirteenth and Fourteenth cen|turies, when the name of Piks had vani&s;hed. However there were certainly Iri&s;h and Welch churchmen allowed to &s;ettle in Pikland, from the Fifth century downward. The church of Aber|nethy was founded about the year 600, by Gar|nat IV. or by Nethan II. kings of the Piks. Abernethy is &s;outh of the Grampian hills; and of cour&s;e among the&s;e Piks, who were converted by Ninian. To the north of the&s;e hills there is no evidence of any religious foundation whatever, till after the Ninth century. About 700, Brudi, &s;on of Derili, founded religious hou&s;es at Culro&s;s; and in Saint Serf's ile Lochleven, if we believe Win|ton. Dunkeld was founded by Con&s;tantin, about 800. The &s;tory of St. Regulus is fabulous; and St. Andrew's was founded by Ungu&s;t, about 825. In &s;hort, the Four places of religion, <HI>Abernethy,</HI> which Innes rightly puts as the mo&s;t ancient, <HI>Lochleven, Dunkeld,</HI> and <HI>St. Andrew's,</HI> were the only places in Pikland where any chronicle, or catalogue of the kings could be kept. For till after the Piki&s;h line is &s;aid to have failed, 843, there was not another religious hou&s;e in the whole kingdom. There was a Chronicle of Abernethy<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Fordun IV. 12. quotes it once for the foundation of Abernethy, by Garnat IV. &s;on of Domelch.</NOTE>, which is unfortunately lo&s;t. But Winton has copied his li&s;t from a catalogue kept at Lochleven; and the Regi&s;ter of St. Andrew's has pre&s;erved another. Tho Lochleven being near St. Andrew's,
<PB N="258" REF="345" MS="Y">and the mona&s;tery there immediately &s;ubject to the canons of that &s;ee, the&s;e two la&s;t li&s;ts have been mutilated by mutual connivance, in order to bring down the commencement of the Piki&s;h monarchy to a later period than the vi&s;ionary date of the Scoti&s;h. The Regi&s;ter of St. Andrew's quotes the ancient books of the &s;ee, which related to the Piki&s;h period, by the title of LIBRI PICTO|RUM; and produces a Latin charter of Ungu&s;t II. from the&s;e <HI>libri Pictorum</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Sibbald's Hi&s;t. of Fife: 'in veteribus Pictorum libris &s;cripta reperimus.'</NOTE>.

From the&s;e con&s;iderations it follows, that as the Piks had religious hou&s;es among them, from the Seventh century, and books concerning their affairs were extant in the Twelfth, the memory of reigns and events mu&s;t have been kept among them; and the poor pre&s;erva|tion of the names of their kings is &s;o much a mat|ter of cour&s;e, that it would have been truly extra|ordinary, if it had not happened, while the li&s;ts of Dani&s;h Norwegian and Swedi&s;h kings from the Sixth century are admitted; tho the&s;e nations had not Chri&s;tianity, nor religious hou&s;es, till the Tenth century.</P>
<P N="11">11. For the kings of the Saxon heptarchies we have only one authority older than the Twelfth and Thirteenth centuries, the Saxon Chronicle; and, as it is by no means full, we freely tru&s;t authors of the Twelfth, Thirteenth, and Four|teenth centuries, in any further intelligence they give. Our late&s;t Piki&s;h Chronicle is from a ma|nu&s;cript of the beginning of the Fourteenth cen|tury; and &s;uppo&s;ing, what will appear an impo&s;&s;ibility to any one who looks into it, that it was compo&s;ed at the time of the Manu&s;cript's being written, it
<PB N="259" REF="346">is impo&s;&s;ible, for any cold and candid mind, to conceive why le&s;s credit &s;hould be given to it con|cerning early tran&s;actions, than is given to other monuments of that age concerning &s;uch tran&s;|actions.</P>
<P N="12">12. To conclude the&s;e con&s;iderations, it may be &s;afely &s;aid that he, who denies the authority of our Five li&s;ts of Piki&s;h kings, may, with equal rea&s;on, deny all hi&s;toric authority; or believe, and reject, at plea&s;ure, as his own caprice &s;hall dictate. For it will to every free mind appear much more rational to credit Five different pieces, containing barely events, &s;o uni|ver&s;ally marked and known, as the names of a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of kings, with the number of years they reigned; and all written in the country in which they reigned, probably from more ancient monu|ments compo&s;ed during their reigns, but at any rate drawn up within four centuries after this &s;eries clo&s;ed; than to lend faith to the early hi&s;|tory of Greece, or Rome. For in the la&s;t in&s;tances we credit writers, who lived five or &s;ix centuries after the events they relate, for minute relations or the&s;e events; tho they happened in a period when there were none to record them. In the former we only credit the univer&s;ally known and marked circum&s;tances of the names of kings, and years of their reign, the &s;ure&s;t and mo&s;t infallible features of hi&s;tory: and the greater part of the &s;eries belongs to a period when Chri&s;tianity prevailed in the country, and there were men who u&s;ed letters to record it. In the early hi&s;tory of Greece and Rome we have no collateral authorities. In the Piki&s;h &s;eries we have the &s;tronge&s;t collateral autho|rities, of authentic writers, of &s;urrounding nations. In the former we generally tru&s;t to one writer for minute events. In the later we tru&s;t Five, for the mo&s;t notorious events in hi&s;tory.</P>

In the&s;e Annals the ancient matters, as appears from repeated quotations, are from Tighernac who wrote in the year 1088; and Ware's account of Iri&s;h hi&s;tory is derived almo&s;t wholly from them.

<PB N="261" REF="348" MS="Y">is &s;een, whole father ever held the &s;ceptre. The kingdom, like tho&s;e of Sweden and Denmark, was elective; but the kings were cho&s;en out of a pe|culiar and numerous race of nobles; who all de|riving their genealogy from ancient monarchs, were called REGALIS PROSAPIA, or THE ROYAL RACE. Jornandes informs us of &s;imilar races among the O&s;trogoths, or Ea&s;tern Getae; and Vi&s;ogoths, or We&s;tern Getae. The election, as in other Gothic kingdoms, mu&s;t have re&s;ted with the people who in Caledonia had &s;uch &s;way that Dio<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. Dio lib. 76. de Caledoniis loquens.</NOTE> &s;ays, the government was chiefly democratic. As for men being delivered over, like &s;heep on an e&s;tate, from one lord to his heir, tho u&s;eful in great and refined monarchies, &s;uch an idea does not even occur to a warlike people. Among the Piks he of the royal race, who was &s;trong, valiant, and wi&s;e, would be cho&s;en; but when two candidates of equal worth appeared, and the balance was doubtful, he was cho&s;en who, de&s;cending of the royal race, by the female line, was thought to have a &s;urer claim to royal blood; than him who de|&s;cended by the male line. Of this rule of elective &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, Beda thus in&s;tructs us: <HI>ut, ubi res ve|niret in dubium, magis de foeminea regnum pro&s;apia, quam de ma&s;culina, regem &s;ibi</HI> ELIGERENT: <HI>quod u&s;|que hodie apud Pictos con&s;tat e&s;&s;e &s;ervatum</HI><NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">The Saxon tran&s;lation by Alfred is, <HI>Mid thy Pe$htar wif naefdon baedon him fram Scottum.

There are al&s;o nations, adds he, where rea&s;ons of &s;tate, or &s;ome maxim of religion, de|mand that a certain family &s;hould always reign. Such is in India the jealou&s;y of it's blood, and the fear of a defect in it's &s;ucce&s;&s;on, that, to have always princes of the blood royal, the &s;ons of the king's elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter are preferred. Some tribes of

<P>Let me add a few more in&s;tances of this practice. Polybius, lib. XII. tells us that the Locrians e&s;timated nobility, not by the male, but by the female line. Nicolaus Da|ma&s;cenus<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">In excerpt. Vales. p. 516.</NOTE> &s;ays, that among the Lycians the daughters and not the &s;ons inherited<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sueno ob&s;erves, p. 73, that among the old Danes daugh|ters and &s;ons were equal heirs; but he gives a fabulous origin of the cu&s;tom.</NOTE>. A late author<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Lord Kames, in his Sketches of the Hi&s;tory of Man.</NOTE> ob&s;erves that, among the Natches on Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, who believe their royal race children of the &s;un, the &s;i&s;ter's &s;on always &s;ucceeds: and that in Fouli, a negro kingdom of Africa, the female line always inherit the crown, there being no &s;ecurity in the male line, as the women are prone to gallantry. Voltaire<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ai &s;ur l' Hi&s;t. Univ.</NOTE> remarks that in Cochin the king's &s;on is not heir, but the &s;i&s;ter's &s;on; a practice al&s;o found in Guinea.</P>
<P>That the Piki&s;h kingdom was ELECTIVE is clear from the above deci&s;ive pa&s;&s;age of Beda, who was cotemporary with it, and lived on it's bor|ders. That this was the plan of the other Gothic kingdoms is al&s;o well known. Tacitus &s;ays of the Germans, that they cho&s;e their kings from the nobility of their race<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Reges ex nobilitate, duces ex virtute &s;umunt. Tacit. Germ.</NOTE>: and the highe&s;t race, that of royal progeny, mu&s;t have been the mo&s;t noble. M. Mallet informs us, that, in ancient Denmark and Sweden, the very &s;ame cu&s;tom prevailed; the kingdom was elective, but the people always cho&s;e one of the royal blood, which they revered as &s;prung from the gods. But about the year 900, we find the kings of Denmark, by a gradual in|crea&s;e of power, had influence enough to pa&s;s the
<PB N="265" REF="352">kingdom to their own &s;ons; for Gormo the Old then &s;ucceeded his father Horda-Cnut; as Harald Blatang &s;ucceeded his father Gormo: and this mode generally happened afterward. In Sweden al&s;o hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion &s;eems to have been as early allowed. Yet the&s;e kingdoms continued elective to la&s;t century, as is well known. The Runic characters were, it is thought, unknown in the Northern kingdoms till Chri&s;tianity appeared there; and at any rate all allow that they were only u&s;ed in in&s;criptions till that event; &s;o that we have not one written monument of any kind till the eleventh century. Hence their hi&s;tory being confined to the &s;ong of the bard, and the old &s;ongs being con&s;tantly &s;upplanted by new ones, the authors of which often accommodated old times to their own ideas, we know nothing certain con|cerning the old mode of elective &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the throne. The names of the kings are pre&s;erved; but that they were &s;ometimes &s;ons of their praede|ce&s;&s;ors we have no authority, except that of igno|rant bards, who knew no manners, &s;ave tho&s;e of their own times. Saxo's work, which is built on the &s;ongs of the bards, is now ju&s;tly regarded as quite fabulous down to the Tenth century, when the real hi&s;tory of Denmark begins, as Mallet has ju&s;tly ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>The power of the Gothic &s;overeigns depended wholly on the will of the people in very clime. In Thrace, as in Pikland, we have examples of kings depo&s;ed<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">See the example of Scyles, Herodot.

In the a&s;|&s;emblies the meane&s;t pea&s;ant either &s;at, or was re|pre&s;ented; and the king followed their in&s;tructions. Among the northern Germans, the Lugii, Suiones, Sitones, the kings had indeed more power, than among the &s;outhern, as we learn from Tacitus: a circum&s;tance apparently owing to the wealth of individuals, and con&s;equent ari&s;tocracy in the &s;outhern &s;tates, which circum&s;cribed the regal power with perpetual rival&s;hip; while in the northern the king had no rivals in wealth, or power, but, if a good monarch, was ab&s;olute in the united affection of his &s;ubjects; while, if bad, his power was annulled by univer&s;al hatred and contempt.</P>
<P>In Pikland, it is clear from the Chronicles, that there mu&s;t have been a law, as in other coun|tries above-mentioned, that the &s;on &s;hould never &s;ucceed the father in the kingdom. We find brothers cho&s;en to &s;ucceed brothers; but never &s;ons to &s;ucceed fathers. A grand rea&s;on for this was, the &s;uperior e&s;timation of the female line;
<PB N="267" REF="354">for uterine brothers were of all heirs the &s;ure&s;t, as both &s;prang of one mother. Any other heir in the female line was more di&s;tant from the foun|tain of royal blood. Another rea&s;on was, that, for a &s;on to &s;ucceed his father, would have been an u&s;urpation of the rights of the other families of the Royal Race, who were all intitled to their turn of &s;overeignty, when next it by merit and by the female line. And another rea&s;on was, that the Piks living in con&s;tant war, and inva&s;ion of the Britons, they required to have always a &s;overeign leader of mature prudence, as well as valour; whereas, in almo&s;t every ca&s;e, the &s;on of a de|cea&s;t king would be young and inexperienced.</P>
<P>Fordun<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">IV. 1.

But Mr. O'Flaherty and Mr. O'Conor &s;hew, that the kings and chiefs of Ireland were elected by the people out of particular races. The difference between them and the Piks lay chiefly in this, that the former pre|ferred the male, the later the female line. When the for|mer was preferred, the election carries appearance of &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion; for nothing but &s;ome defect, which might not occur in many ages, could &s;et a&s;ide the male heir. So in Denmark and Sweden, tho elective kingdoms, down to la&s;t century, the &s;on almo&s;t con&s;tantly &s;ucceeds the father.</NOTE> has, with the con&s;ummate ignorance to be expected in a monk of the end of the four|teenth century, a&s;&s;erted, that the mode of <HI>&s;ucee&s;|&s;ion</HI> among the old Scots and Piks was &s;imilar; namely, as he &s;tates, that if the &s;on of the de|cea&s;t king was young, his uncle or cou&s;in &s;uc|ceeded; and the &s;on came in on the death of &s;uch heir. He totally mi&s;takes the ca&s;e, for <HI>election,</HI> and not &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, was u&s;ed in both nations. But the fact is, that the <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ion,</HI> as he calls it, among the old Scots, was wholly in the male line, as every one, the lea&s;t ver&s;ed in their hi&s;tory, mu&s;t perceive at once: and tho, as Fordun &s;tates,
<PB N="268" REF="355" MS="Y">if the &s;on was too young, his uncle, or cou&s;in, was called to the throne, yet the &s;on was never wholly &s;et a&s;ide, as with the Piks, but &s;ucceeded in his turn. Thus when Fergus I. died, 530, Domangard his &s;on &s;ucceeded; whom followed Congal, &s;on of Domangard, then Gauran, bro|ther of Congal, then Conal, &s;on of Congal, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. In Ireland this was al&s;o the exact ca&s;e. And, &s;o far was the female line from being pre|ferred, that it was wholly cut out from the regal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; as in other &s;ucce&s;&s;ions the law of ga|velkind was univer&s;al, by which the &s;ons &s;hared equally, but the daughters were altogether thrown out<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Davis, O'Conor, &amp;c.</NOTE>.

<P>Very different was the &s;tate of women among all the Gothic nations. The Goths, a wi&s;e, va|liant, and generous race, almo&s;t adored their wo|men; and endeavoured to compen&s;ate the deli|cate weakne&s;s, and numerous pains and infirmi|ties of the &s;ex, by tender attentions and cor|dial re&s;pect. Even among the Scythae, or ear|lie&s;t
<PB N="269" REF="356">Goths, we find this original fountain of mo|dern galantry. In Herodotus, Idanthyr&s;us, a king of ' the Scythae, an&s;wers Darius, that he knows of no &s;uperiors, &s;ave Jove, his progeni|tor, and Hi&s;tia, the queen of the Scythae, his own wife<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Herodot. IV. 127.</NOTE>. The Ve&s;igoths made daughters equal heirs with the &s;ons. The Germans, as Tacitus<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Germania.</NOTE> informs us, regarded women even with adoration, and admitted them to &s;overeignty equally with the other &s;ex. The Sitones, ance&s;tors of the pre|&s;ent Swedes, were in his time ruled by a woman. Mr. Mallet ob&s;erves<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Northern Ant. I. 314.</NOTE>, 'the northern nations did not &s;o much con&s;ider the other &s;ex, as made for plea&s;ure, as to be their equals and companions, who&s;e e&s;teem, as valuable as their other favours, could only be obtained by con&s;tant attentions, by generous &s;ervices, and by a proper exertion of virtue and courage.' In the early &s;tate of &s;ociety courage was a virtue of as great importance in the fair &s;ex, as in the men; tho in refined &s;o|ciety an extreme delicacy and mode&s;ty are mo&s;t e&s;teemed, and every thing manly or forward ju&s;tly regarded as blameworthy. Objects of our tender re&s;pect, they mu&s;t not violate their own mode&s;t character by any manly office; for, when they de&s;cend to &s;uch, we &s;ee them become our equals, and drop our adoration; a female cea&s;ing to be a godde&s;s as &s;oon as &s;he &s;teps from the &s;anctuary of timid and retired mode&s;ty. Such was al&s;o the opinion of the Greeks and Romans, na|tions of Scythic or Gothic origin, as fully di&s;|played in the di&s;&s;ertation annexed. In their early hi&s;tory we find the women bold as the men; but in their advanced &s;ociety, a timid mode&s;ty was all in all. Yet their women were ever free as na|ture made them; and not &s;laves, as our &s;uperfi|cial theori&s;ts dream. Among the early Goths,
<PB N="270" REF="357" MS="Y">the women &s;hared in the &s;uperlative courage of the men. Ancient writers te&s;tify, that the Scy|thian women u&s;ed often to proceed to battle, with their hu&s;bands and brothers. Scandinavian tradi|tion pre&s;erves the names of Vegbiorga, Hetha, Vi&s;na, Ladgertha, Hervora, and other warlike ladies<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Olaus Magnus. Hervarar Saga, &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE>. In Britain the name of Boadicea is illu&s;|trious. She was queen of the Iceni, of the Belgic or Gothic part of Britain.</P>
<P>Dr. Stuart ob&s;erves that, among the Franks, as well as the Anglo-Saxons, the queens &s;hared in the government; and, among the former, there is the example of a queen who received a national homage. <HI>Greg.

It may move the reader's wonder that the mo&s;t warlike nations &s;hould have this cu&s;tom. Per|haps it may &s;pring from their men di&s;daining all inferiority to each other; tho they find it nece&s;&s;ary to have a ruler. We may therefore laugh at Tacitus, who affects to de&s;pi&s;e the Sitones, becau&s;e ruled by a woman. The&s;e barbarians would have &s;corned the Romans, the &s;laves of an emperor.</NOTE> were remarkable for
<PB N="271" REF="358">devotion to their women; and it is likely that the Peukini and Ba&s;ternae, who peopled Scandinavia, might partly derive this practice from them, as they were the extreme Goths who bordered on the Sarmatae.</P>
<P>This re&s;pectful attention of the Goths to their women mu&s;t be regarded as one great cau&s;e of the attachment of the Piks, a Gothic people, to the female line. The &s;ucce&s;&s;ion however did not run in this line: for, according to Beda, it was only preferred, <HI>ubi res veniret in dubium,</HI> when the matter was in doubt. But this <HI>matter</HI> was not the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, but the election; as is clear from the context, and word, <HI>eligerent,</HI> '&s;hould ELECT,' as above explained. They who dream of heredi|tary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;on to father among the Piks, only &s;hew gro&s;s ignorance of the barbarous Gothic governments. The Goths in Italy, France, Spain, nay England, &s;oon adopted the refined idea of modern &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. But it is in Germany and Scandinavia, and among the Ea&s;tern and We&s;tern <HI>Getae,</HI> the ancient and rude &s;ettlements of the Goths, as was al&s;o Pikland, that we mu&s;t look for the model of the Piki&s;h monarchy; and we will find it elective, as &s;hewn by Beda, and the Piki&s;h Chronicles. They elected the able&s;t of the royal race; but when doubt aro&s;e, from the equal abilities of the candidates, the mo&s;t noble was cho&s;en; and this nobility was calculated by the female line. Some may incline to think that the above words of Beda, <HI>ubi res veniret in dubium,</HI> 'when the matter was in doubt,' are &s;uperfluous, and that the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was direct in the female line. But had this been the ca&s;e, a child might have been king by indi&s;putable right; and Beda is not &s;peaking of a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, but of an election,
<PB N="272" REF="359">as is palpable from the context: and it is impo&s;|&s;ible, without wre&s;ting the pa&s;&s;age, to give it any other interpretation than what is here &s;hewn.</P>
<P>Before clo&s;ing this con&s;ideration of the re&s;pect of the Piks for the female line, the following hints, collected by an ingenious writer<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Dr. Stuart, View of Society.</NOTE>, may be produced. Tacitus tells us that, among the Germans, 'the &s;ons of &s;i&s;ters were equally re|garded by the uncle as by the father'. Hence it is, &s;ays Monte&s;quieu, that our earlie&s;t hi&s;torians &s;peak in &s;uch &s;trong terms of the love of the kings of the Franks for the children of their &s;i&s;|ters. John de Laet remarks of the Bra&s;ilians, that they call their uncles and aunts, <HI>fathers</HI> and <HI>mothers:</HI> and the &s;ame cu&s;tom prevails among the North American Indians. Among the Hurons, &s;ays Charlevoix, with whom the dignity of chief is hereditary, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is continued thro the women; &s;o that, at the death of a prince, it is not his own but his &s;i&s;ter's &s;on who &s;ucceeds; and, in default of him, the neare&s;t relation in the female line. The Ethiopians, &s;ays Dama&s;cenus, exhibit the greate&s;t honour to their &s;i&s;ters; and the kings deliver the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion not to their own &s;ons, but tho&s;e of their &s;i&s;ters. The&s;e facts &s;hew the early importance of the &s;ex; and confirm the remark of Ari&s;totle, that the Celts alone of all nations held their women in contempt. An exception which does them no honour; for as, with bea&s;ts, the mo&s;t valiant and generous, pay the greate&s;t attention to their females, while the mo&s;t &s;tupid and cowardly maltreat them, &s;o it is with men: and what a lion is to an a&s;s, &s;uch is a Goth to a Celt.</P>
<P N="2">&sect; II. <HI>The manner in which hi&s;toric li&s;ts of kings have been pre&s;erved by tradition.</HI> The names of the whole Dani&s;h, Swedi&s;h, and Norwegian, kings preceding the Eleventh century, have been pre|&s;erved by tradition only. This mu&s;t al&s;o have been
<PB N="273" REF="360" MS="Y">the ca&s;e with the Piki&s;h till the Fifth century, when Chri&s;tianity was received in the &s;outh of Pikland; and perhaps later. A &s;hort di&s;qui&s;ition into the method of this tradition may not therefore be un|nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The &s;calds, or bards of the Scandinavian na|tions, are well known. The&s;e &s;calds were not only the poets, but the hi&s;torians and genealogi&s;ts of the time. Having judgment enough to per|ceive that, in matters of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion and genealogy, the plain truth was the only object, they compo&s;ed hi&s;toric and genealogic &s;ongs, devoid of all orna|ment, and only, valuable from their veracity. Containing barely names, and years, a very &s;hort &s;ong commemorated the genealogy, or hi&s;tory, of many ages. The Chronicle of St Olaf<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Apud. Loccen. Ant. Sueo Goth. p. 90.</NOTE> &s;ays of a &s;cald, <HI>Oc taldi han longfedga till Semingh,</HI> 'And he computed the generations up to Seming. 'And again, <HI>I tui kvedi ero uptalde XXX langfedga Rogn|walls,</HI> 'In this &s;ong are enumerated the thirty generations of Rognwall.' Much about the hi&s;toric poets may be found in the fir&s;t volume of the Hi&s;tory of Norway, by Torfaeus, which for the &s;ake of brevity &s;hall not be here repeated. Shorro Sturle&s;on tells us, in his preface, that Thiodolf, &s;cald of Harald Harfagre, king of Norway in the Tenth century, wrote hi&s;toric &s;ongs to a petty monarch, Rognvald, in which the names, actions, and &s;epulchres, of thirty of his ance&s;tors were de|clared. And that Eyvind, in this &s;ongs to Earl Haquin, gave a &s;eries of his ance&s;tors. Snorro chiefly follows Thiodolf; and &s;ays, "Therefore we, in compo&s;ing our hi&s;tory, generally follow the thread of tho&s;e things which are commemorated in the&s;e &s;ongs; becau&s;e the poets them&s;elves u&s;ed to repeat them in pre&s;ence of the kings, and of their &s;ons." The &s;cald was one of the king's chief officers, and always of his council; and his great
<PB N="274" REF="361">employment was to compo&s;e the lives of kings, and hi&s;tories of the kingdom. Mr. Mallet has ju&s;tly ob&s;erved that the pre&s;ervation of genealogies was one great part of the &s;cald's office. This method of compo&s;ing hi&s;tory in ver&s;e was con|tinued to late times. The mo&s;t ancient work ex|tant in the Swedi&s;h language, is an anonymous metrical chronicle written 1319. And our Win|ton wrote in the &s;ame manner about 1420.</P>
<P>But it was from the &s;hort hi&s;toric &s;ong, repeated by the King's &s;cald at coronations, that the mo&s;t &s;olemn and authentic evidence was derived. This &s;ong con&s;i&s;ted merely of the names of the king's antece&s;&s;ors, woven into barren ver&s;e: and the grandeur of the occa&s;ion, and number of wit|ne&s;&s;es, made an high regard to veracity requi&s;ite. The King's &s;cald was an envied office; and, had he made any &s;lip, many of his brethren would have been happy to expo&s;e it, in hopes of &s;up|planting him by &s;uperior &s;kill. It may ea&s;ily be conceived that the uncommon mode of determin|ing the nobility of the kings among the Piks, would render the pre&s;ervation of genealogies ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The computation by generations is in fact the very ba&s;is of all barbaric hi&s;tory. Even the early hi&s;tory of Greece and Rome depended on them. Sir I&s;aac Newton has, in his Chronology, remarked that 'Pherecydes the Athenian, in the reign of Darius Hy&s;ta&s;pes, or &s;oon after, wrote of the an|tiquities, and ancient genealogies, of the Athe|nians, in Ten Books; and was one of the fir&s;t European writers of this kind, and one of the be&s;t; whence he had the name of <HI>Genealogus;</HI> and by Diony&s;ius Halicarna&s;&s;eus is &s;aid to be &s;econd to none of the genealogers.

<P N="3">&sect; III. <HI>The Plan upon which the Chronology of our Piki&s;h monarchs is to be adju&s;ted.</HI> This is ea&s;ily done from a noted pa&s;&s;age of Beda, who informs us that the year of Chri&s;t, 565, was the Ninth year of the reign of Brudi, &s;on of Meilochon. His reign of cour&s;e commenced in the year of Chri&s;t 557; and to this grand epoch all the other reigns can ea&s;ily be referred, by means of their duration being marked in the catalogues. As for in&s;tance: Brudi began to reign 557 years before Chri&s;t; his praedece&s;&s;or Galan reigned two years, and of cour&s;e began 555: and Brudi reigning Thirty years, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or Garnat began to reign in 587: and &s;o on. The acce&s;&s;ion of Kenneth to the Piki&s;h throne in 843; the death of Ungu&s;t in 761, the year of Dru&s;t in which St. Patrick went to Ireland, &amp;c. are al&s;o epochs of the &s;ame u&s;e, had Beda lent no a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>By this calculation the year 412, about which time Ninian converted the Southern Piks, as ap|pears al&s;o from Beda, ju&s;t precedes the reign of Dru&s;t, the Thirty-&s;eventh of the Piki&s;h kings. Of cour&s;e with his reign commences a new and luminous period, as the Iri&s;h and Welch church|men who &s;ettled in Pikland u&s;ed letters, and tra|dition is exchanged for hi&s;toric authority. Now it is mo&s;t remarkable, and mu&s;t alone of it&s;elf af|ford conviction to every free mind of the veracity of our Piki&s;h chronicles, that with this very Dru&s;t, under whom the light of Chri&s;tianity appeared, cea&s;es a fabulous circum&s;tance of the&s;e chronicles, namely, the immoderate length of many of the reigns. For this Dru&s;t is &s;aid to have lived a
<PB N="276" REF="363" MS="Y">hundred years, and fought a hundred battles; which is only a barbaric phra&s;e for living very long, and fighting a prodigious number of battles: but AFTER him no reign exceeds Thirty years. Whereas BEFORE him many of the reigns are fabulou&s;ly long; owing to the natural uncertainty of tradition, and he wi&s;h of the &s;calds to increa&s;e the antiquity of the royalty. Thus Talorc, the im|mediate predece&s;&s;or of this Dru&s;t, is marked to have reigned 75 years; and Garnat, predece&s;&s;or of Talorc, 60. Nay, five of the others are put at 100 years each. But this fabulous length of the reigns totally vani&s;hes when Chri&s;tianity began.</P>
<P>In like manner the mo&s;t ancient Per&s;ian kings have reigns of 800, or 1000 years<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Richard&s;on on Ea&s;t. Lit.</NOTE>. Nay Tor|faeus<NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot">Series Reg, Dan. p. 233.</NOTE>, in <HI>reforming</HI> the hi&s;tory of Denmark, is &s;o fooli&s;h as to make Annius Grandaevus live 210, and reign 190 years!</P>
<P>This grand and leading circum&s;tance &s;erves to divide the Piki&s;h Series into two parts. The FIRST of which contains the kings prior to Dru&s;t, and Chri&s;tianity: the SECOND, tho&s;e of the follow|ing period.</P>
<P>The FIRST part of the Piki&s;h &s;eries cannot be admitted to direct hi&s;toric faith. For tho the epithets of the kings, and other minute, but im|portant, marks, &s;erve to e&s;tabli&s;h it's general au|thenticity; yet, as it &s;tands on &s;caldic tradition alone, it would be ra&s;h to give this part as hi&s;toric truth. The length of the reigns is palpably fabulous; and hi&s;tory is &s;o aver&s;e from fable, that it dreads the lea&s;t connexion with it. But this part of the &s;eries &s;tands on the &s;ame &s;caldic ground, and is equally authentic with the accounts of Dani&s;h, Norwegian, or Swedi&s;h monarchs, preceding the Tenth century. Of cour&s;e it de|&s;erves attention; and if not fit for hi&s;toric, is at
<PB N="277" REF="364" MS="Y">lea&s;t proper for poetical authority. When our hi&s;tory becomes &s;tudied and under&s;tood, many future poets may u&s;e the&s;e old kings with good effect. It will pre&s;ently be &s;hewn that the Piki&s;h kingdom was confined to the Hebud Iles till about the reign, of Dru&s;t; if he indeed was not the monarch &s;ome of who&s;e many battles e&s;tabli&s;hed his authority over all the Piks. This part of the &s;eries therefore contains more properly the kings of the Hebud I&s;les, than of the Piks in general: but as the other Piks lived in democracy, as Dio &s;hews, and this line of monarchs afterward ex|tended it's power over them, it has al&s;o a claim to be regarded as belonging to the &s;eries of kings of Pikland. As the fabulous length of the reigns renders this part even unfit for the purpo&s;es of poetry, which loves veri&s;imilitude, this may be ea&s;ily amended in a veracious and mathematical manner. Sir I&s;aac Newton has ju&s;tly ob&s;erved that the number of years a&s;&s;igned to the Roman kings from Romulus to Tarquin, the la&s;t of them is mo&s;t ab&s;urd; and finds, from the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of all ancient and modern monarchies, that no &s;eries of princes reign at a medium above Eighteen years each. Hence he takes 125 years from the anti|quity of Rome; and &s;uppo&s;es it founded 625 years before Chri&s;t. Nothing is more ju&s;t than this; and the calculation is as infallible as any in arithmetic, or geometry. But Sir I&s;aac calculates from civi|lized monarchies, as the Roman al&s;o was, when he allows &s;o much as Eighteen years for a medium: and Mr. Richard&s;on ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, that he a&s;&s;igns too great a length to reigns of 'kings for his rule to be univer&s;al. For the Caliphs, from the death of Mahomet to the &s;ack of Bagdat, reign little more than ten years each: and, even in a &s;ettled and civilized kingdom, the Greek emperors, from Zeno to the taking of Con&s;tantinople, have only fifteen years each. Sir I&s;aac indeed ob&s;erves him|&s;elf
<PB N="278" REF="365">that the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Alexander have but 15 &frac14; and eighteen kings of Babylon only 11 &frac23; years each. The longe&s;t is that of the kings of Judah, who have 22: but 16 is at any rate the medium, even in poli&s;hed and &s;ettled kingdoms; and not 18, as Sir I&s;aac makes it. But in barbaric kingdoms the reigns are far more tumultuous and &s;hort. From 430 to 778, were no le&s;s than thirty kings of Ireland in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion reigning at a medium but Eleven years each. The heptarchic kings of England have little more; tho&s;e of Northumbria in particular almo&s;t the &s;ame. And among the Piks, a yet more ferocious people, it is evident, from the part of the &s;eries after Dru&s;t, that the kings hardly reigned Eleven years each at a me|dium. There being al&s;o no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that the early Piki&s;h kings reigned longer than the others, it is matter of plain arithmetical cal|culation, to reduce the fabulous length of the&s;e reigns to veri&s;imilitude. For if the la&s;t Forty kings fill 429 years, the fir&s;t Thirty-&s;ix mu&s;t fill 386. The&s;e 386 years, calculated back from 414, the beginning of Dru&s;t's reign, fix the reign of Cruthen, and commencement of the Piki&s;h monarchy, to the Twenty-eighth year after Chri&s;t's birth. And, as the years of the&s;e fir&s;t Thirty-&s;ix kings, as they &s;tand, amount to no le&s;s than 1548, of which 386, the ju&s;t &s;pace, is almp&s;t exactly a quarter, if we put down the reign of each king at one quarter of it's pretended duration, we &s;hall attain every degree of veri&s;imilitude nece&s;&s;ary for poetry, or perhaps attainable in &s;uch kind of hi&s;|tory. This plan is accordingly followed in dige&s;t|ing the FIRST part of this &s;eries.</P>
<P>The SECOND part requires no a&s;&s;i&s;tance; being quite uniform, complete, and hi&s;toric. The years of he reigns are taken ONLY from the in|valuable Piki&s;h Chronicle, No. V. which al&s;o agree with the Iri&s;h Nennius, &s;ave in one or two
<PB N="279" REF="366">in&s;tances. Winton gives no years of reigns; but only the names. The year in the two other monuments, Fordun and the Regi&s;ter of St. An|drew's, are almo&s;t perpetually erroneous; and con|tradicting cotemporary Iri&s;h and Engli&s;h authors, de&s;erve no credit whatever. The&s;e two chroni|cles, being al&s;o mutilated, and perverted, by Scoti&s;h tran&s;cribers, only merit attention as colla|teral proofs of the Piki&s;h &s;eries. The SOLE error in the number of years given by the Piki&s;h Chro|nicle, No. V. belongs to Kiniod, &s;on of Luthrin; who, in the publication by Innes in his Appendix, has but xi years, while the Iri&s;h Nennius gives him xix. Innes al&s;o gives him 19 in his Series of Piki&s;h kings, Vol. I. p. 134, without even hinting that the Chronicle bore xi; tho he be mo&s;t exact in all the others: which leads to a conclu&s;ion that xi. is a mere error of the pre&s;s in Innes's Appendix, the la&s;t x of xix being omitted. That xix is the ju&s;t number is undoubted from the whole chroni|cle, and it's collateral proofs; but whether the x. be omitted by Innes's printer, by a tran&s;criber, or in the original MS. it mu&s;t equally be a bare omi&s;&s;ion, and a mo&s;t pardonable one. For num|bers, as all know, are very apt to be corrupted in old MSS. and that in &s;o many numbers but one little x &s;hould &s;lip out, is rather a miracle of ac|curacy, than matter of blame.</P>
<P>In &s;pelling<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">The names of Engli&s;h heptarchic kings are as variou&s;ly &s;pelled as the Piki&s;h, hardly two old authors agreeing in or|thography of names.</NOTE> the names i have compared the Five catalogues, and taken that which &s;eemed mo&s;t uniform, and proper, &s;paring no pains to render the &s;pelling, i have followed, the mo&s;t neat, and fit, &s;o that it might ever remain, and be generally followed, as it is humbly hoped it will be approved.

<P>THE Piks, proceeding from Scandinavia about 300 years before Chri&s;t, as above &s;hewn, would, in their voyage toward North Bri|tain, fir&s;t arrive at the Orkneys, a barren and de|&s;ert tract, which they would de&s;pi&s;e. That the&s;e iles were uninhabited about the year 240 after Chri&s;t, is mentioned by Solinus. And it &s;eems that the Piks left no &s;ettlement there; but pro|ceeded along the northern coa&s;t of Scotland; which finding bleak, mountainous, and forbidding, and probably at that time a continued fore&s;t of black pines, echoing to the northern breeze, they coa&s;ted along till they di&s;covered the green, vales of Ireland. The&s;e tempted their approach; but perceiving that fine iland too large and populous for their armament, and the people prepared to with&s;tand them, they &s;tood over for the Hebud. Iles, which from their comparative &s;mallne&s;s gave room to hope for better &s;ucce&s;s. Here they ac|cordingly effected a &s;ettlement, that was in the cour&s;e of a century or two to &s;pread all over North Britain; the Cumri being driven before their arms, fir&s;t from the Hebud ides, where names of places &s;hew their ancient po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions: then from the northern and we&s;tern parts, &s;o lyable to attacks from the&s;e iles; and la&s;tly from the ea&s;t and &s;outh.</P>
<PB N="282" REF="369" MS="Y">
<P>That this was the Piki&s;h progre&s;s is clear from Beda and Nennius. The fir&s;t of whom mentions their going fir&s;t to Ireland, whence they &s;tood over to the oppo&s;ite tracts of Britain. Nennius &s;ays they fir&s;t &s;eized on the Orkneys; but Solinus &s;hews that, if they did &s;o, they &s;oon abandoned them; and Nennius him&s;elf adds, that it was not from the Orkneys, but the neighbouring iles, <HI>ex in&s;ulis affini|timis,</HI> that they invaded and &s;ubdued the north of Britain. The&s;e neighbouring iles could only be the Hebud Iles; and Beda's relation of their pa&s;|&s;ing from Ireland over to Britain fully confirms this. The u&s;ual tract of the Norwegians after|ward was quite &s;imilar. They pa&s;&s;ed the Ork|neys, and north of Scotland; and proceeded to Ireland, or the we&s;t of Scotland. The Orkneys were inhabited in the reign of Brudi, 565; for Adomnan mentions a regulus, or prince of the Orkneys, at the Court of Brudi. The Piks had, to all appearance, thought proper to &s;eize and po&s;&s;e&s;s them, about the fourth century; when the Roman arms confined them on the &s;outh: and that the Norwegians, when they &s;eized the&s;e iles in the Ninth century, found them po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Piks, &s;hall be afterward &s;hewn. But Solinus mentions them as de&s;ert when he wrote, or about the year 240, while he de&s;cribes a kingdom in the Hebud Iles. All the&s;e circum&s;tances &s;o exactly corre|&s;pond, that there is no room left to doubt, but that the Hebud Iles were the fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the Piks, and tho&s;e from whence they &s;ubdued North Britain.</P>
<P>The Piks, like other colonies, and early &s;ocie|ties, would long be &s;trangers to kings. Divided into &s;mall communities, as circum&s;tances ordered, they would only chu&s;e one leader in times of com|mon danger. But in &s;uch &s;ocieties, as not refined enough for regular and permanent republics, which depend on intricate laws and regulations, the kingly power always creeps in by degrees.
<PB N="283" REF="370">And it mo&s;t natural that this power &s;hould fir&s;t be known to the fir&s;t &s;ettlement, where the &s;ociety would have fir&s;t pa&s;t thro the previous &s;tages. Accordingly there is rea&s;on to believe, that the kingly name and power were known to the Piks of the Hebud Iles, four centuries before the extended over the re&s;t. This appears from the &s;eries of Piki&s;h monarchs, which goes back to Twenty-eight years after Chri&s;t and from Soli|nus, who de&s;cribes the Hebudian monarchy about 240; while it is clear from Tacitus, Dion, and Ammianus, that this monarchy extended not over the other Piks of Caledonia. Tacitus gives no hint of Caledonia's beta under one monarch, tho &s;o &s;ingular a circum&s;tance could not have e&s;caped him. Nay he &s;hews that it was not; for he men|tions that it's &s;tates had formed an alliance for the common defence, and Galgacus was only the mo&s;t noble, and able, of the leaders. Dion mentions that the &s;tates of Caledonia were chiefly demo|cratical. Ammianus Marcellinus tells that &s;o late as the year of Chri&s;t 368, the Piks were divided into two nations, the Dicaledones and Vecturi|ones; &s;o that it &s;eems rea&s;onable to infer that the&s;e two nations had different governments. The for|mer, or Dicaledones, were the Northern Piks, be|yond the Grampian hills; who, having intimate and immediate connexion with the Hebud Iles, had, it is likely, before this acknowleged the authority of the ancient Hebudian Royal Race. The Vecturiones were &s;till in all probability under democratic government. If conjecture may for once be allowed, where proof mu&s;t ever be want|ing, Dru&s;t who &s;ucceeded in 414 was the fir&s;t &s;overeign of all the Piks. Certain it is, that in 565 we find Brudi king of all the Piks, without any hint of the monarchy being new: while in 368 it &s;eems certain that the Piks had no univer&s;al king; &s;o that the fifth century form the medium. And Dru&s;t is mentioned as &s;o great and warlike a
<PB N="284" REF="371">prince, that he &s;eems the mo&s;t likely to have ac|ompli&s;hed compli&s;hed this exten&s;ion of power. The Piki&s;h Monarchy therefore commenced in the Hebud Iles, about 28 years after Chri&s;t. The Dicaledones, or Northern Piks, &s;eem to have been wearied out with democratic di&s;&s;ention; and to have acknow|leged the &s;overeignty of this ancient Royal Race, about 300 years after Chri&s;t. This acce&s;&s;ion of power &s;eems to have enabled the monarch, after many conflicts, to extend his dominion over the Southern Piks about 430. And as this account alone can reconcile all authorities, it &s;eems as true, as it, is natural and ea&s;y.</P>
<P>Solinus, who wrote about, the year 240, has given us, curious information concerning the He|budian monarchy. He &s;ays; 'There are five Hebudes; their inhabitants are ignorant of grain. They live &s;olely on fi&s;h, and milk. One king commands all; for the&s;e iles are divided from each other, only by narrow channels. The king has nothing of his own; but all his effects belong to all. He is bound to equity by certain laws. And, le&s;t avarice &s;hould turn him from the truth, he learns ju&s;tice fiom poverty; having nothing of his own, but being nouri&s;hed by the public. No wife is given to him, but he takes any woman he likes in her turn; whence neither the wi&s;h nor hope of children is allowed to him. Next are the Orkneys, in number thirty-three, de&s;ert of men, and having no woods. A few reedy plants are found; the re&s;t is rock, and barren &s;and<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Solin. Polyh. c. 25.

<P>The Piki&s;h monarchy, anciently confined to the Hebud Iles, was by degrees extended over the northwe&s;t of Pikland, or pre&s;ent Scotland; and Dru&s;t, who begins this &s;eries, &s;eems to have em|ployed &s;ome of his many battles in &s;peading it over all Pikland. For in the next century we find Beda mentions Brudi II. as king of all the Piks, without any hint that the title was new. The reign of Dru&s;t is remarkable, and illu&s;trious, in many re&s;pects; from Chri&s;tianity being e&s;ta|bli&s;hed among the Southern Piks in, or ju&s;t before, his time; from the rude prai&s;e, that he fought a hundred battles; from the frequent incur&s;ions of the Piks, and their &s;eizing on Valentia, when the Romans left the iland. Hence the epithet of Great &s;eems his due; and is often given with le&s;s cau&s;e.</P>
<P>For no le&s;s than TWENTY-SIX reigns, after this, the whole FOUR Chronicles agree in names, and generally in years. And the Fourteen la&s;t of the&s;e Twenty-&s;ix are al&s;o &s;upported by two other au|thorities, the li&s;t in the Iri&s;h Nennius, and the Annals of Tighernac.

Rikeat &s;on of Monet, and his &s;on, and Fingain &s;on of Dru&s;tan, offi|cers on the part of Nethan, fell. The hou&s;e of Ungu&s;t, with Fenach &s;on of Fingair, and Muti, were victorious. Who Nethan was, appears not: but there is every rea&s;on to infer that he was Nethan III. and that he had either e&s;caped, or, as more probable, his friends had rai&s;ed this army to deliver him, and replace him on the throne. Same year another battle was fought at Droma Derg Blathug, in Pikland, between Ungu&s;t and king Dru&s;t, where Dru&s;t fell, and Ungu&s;t became king. The Piks thus felt the u&s;ual di&s;advantages of elective monarchy.</P>
<P N="64">64. UNGUST I. &s;on of Vergu&s;t, A. C. 732 reigned 29 years: the Piki&s;h Chronicle, and Iri&s;h li&s;t, for the &s;ake of a round number, &s;ay 30; an u&s;ual plan in barbaric times, when chronology is inaccurate, and round numbers plea&s;e the memory. The Regi&s;ter of St. Andrew's &s;ays, he reigned 16 years, and after gives him 36. Fordun gives him 14 years: but we know from a Chronicle at the end of Beda; Simeon and Hoveden, that he died in 761. (<HI>Onnu&s;t fil. Urgu&s;t,</HI> A. <HI>Oengu&s;a fil. Fergu&s;a,</HI> B. C.

This prince is noted by extraneous authors, his reign being long, and full of enterprize and glory. In 744 was fought a noted battle between the Piks and Britons of Strat|clyde. <HI>Sim.

<P>But it is to Tighernac that we are chiefly indebted for his fame. Ungu&s;t I. whom the reader has already &s;een always in war, and always victorious in former
<PB N="306" REF="393">reigns; the dethroner of two kings, and the con|queror of every rival; was, after Dru&s;t the Great, the mo&s;t valiant and powerful of our monarchs. His reign, of twenty-nine years, was a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of exertions and acqui&s;itions. The continuator of Beda &s;ays, <HI>Anno</HI> 761 <HI>Oengus Pictorum rex obiit; qui regni &s;ui principium u&s;que ad finem facinore cruento tyrannus perduxit carnifex,</HI> that Ungu&s;t, thro his whole reign, was a bloody tyrant, and execu|tioner. He appears indeed to have been a cruel prince, but at the &s;ame time mo&s;t brave and warlike; nor was clemency a virtue of that age. In his numerous wars he might not &s;hew much re&s;pect to the monks; and this may have induced the mona&s;tic continuator to &s;lander his fame. But let us judge him by his actions. The &s;econd year of his reign, as appears from Tighernac, or 734, a battle was fought between Brudi, &s;on of Ungu&s;t I. and Talorgan, &s;on of Congu&s;t; the later was de|feated, and fled. Three Tears after, or 737, this Talorgan, &s;on of Congu&s;t, was defeated by his brother, and delivered to the people, who drowned him. Nothing more is known concerning this Piki&s;h chief. Talorgan, &s;on of Dru&s;tan, was &s;eized and bound, near the ca&s;tle of Olia; Don Lethfin, apparently his re&s;idence, was de&s;troyed: and he was after obliged to fly to Ireland from the power of Ungu&s;t. In 739 Ungu&s;t ravaged Dal|riada, took Dunat, and burned Creio; and put Dungal and Ferach, the two &s;ons of Selvac, late king of Dalriada, in chains. Brudi, &s;on of Un|gu&s;t, died. A battle was fought at Twini Onirbre, between the Piks and Dalriads: Talorgan, &s;on of Vergu&s;t (apparently brother of Ungu&s;t), de|feated the Dalriads under Murdac, &s;on of Amb|kellach; and pur&s;ued them with great &s;laughter. In 741, Talorgan, &s;on of Dru&s;tan, king of Aha|foitle, was drowned by orders of Ungu&s;t. He &s;eems the &s;ame above-mentioned, who had fled to
<PB N="307" REF="394">Ireland, but had returned. The title of king was very common in the&s;e times; and applied to any chief of great power. The puni&s;hment of drowning, now unknown, was formerly practi&s;ed among the Gothic nations<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Tacitus &s;ays of the Germans, 'Proditores, et trans|&s;ugas, arboribus &s;u&s;pendunt. Ignavos, et imbelles, et cor|pore infames, caeno ac palude, injecta in&s;uper crate, mergunt.' Germ. c. 12. Hence this puni&s;hment appears to have been a mark of great infamy. The <HI>al$um et ba&s;&s;um. pit and gallows,</HI> of feudal laws apparently ro&s;e from this practice. Sueno, p. 113, teils that Eric king of Denmark, in 1135, <HI>Biornonem nepotem &s;uum captivavit annexumque molari in profundum aby&s;&s;i demer&s;it.</HI> And Snorro tells us, that the Swedes boa&s;ted of drowning five of their kings. <HI>Heim&s;kr.</HI> Vol. III.</NOTE>; and even lately in Ru&s;&s;ia. In 742, Cubretan, &s;on of Congu&s;t, died. In 743, a battle was fought at Droma Cathvaoil, between the Piks and Dalriads: and in this year Dalriada was utterly wa&s;ted by Ungu&s;t. The old Dalriadic race of kings now expires, and a new Piki&s;h one &s;ucceeds; as the reader will find, when we come to the kings of Dalriada. Three years after, or 746, the battle of Catho was fought be|tween the Piks and Welch of Strat-clyde; in which Talorgan, &s;on of Vergu&s;t, and brother of Ungu&s;t, fell. In 761, Ungu&s;t died, after an active and glorious reign. For all the&s;e notices we are in|debted to Tighernac, and the Annals of Ul&s;ter. It is impo&s;&s;ible to help &s;u&s;pecting that the great actions of this prince, and in particular his de|&s;troying the kingdom of Dalriada, an Iri&s;h &s;ettle|ment, induced our Iri&s;h Chroniclers in Scotland to pervert the Piki&s;h Chronicles at this period. The kingdom and name of the Old Scots in Britain, mentioned by Adomnan and Beda, totally cea&s;e with the conque&s;t of Dalriada, and are never after to be found. The name of the new, or Pre&s;ent Scots, was given to the Piks about 1020, as after &s;hewn; and the Dalriads

<P>Be&s;ide the&s;e three pretenders, the Regi&s;ter of St. Andrew's and Fordun have, in the Second Part, admitted one u&s;urper, and one erroneous king; namely,</P>
<P><HI>Garnat, &s;on of Feredech,</HI> in the time of Dru&s;t VII. and Elpin I. or about 727, an u&s;urper. But this Garnat is quite unknown to Tighernac, and the Annals of Ul&s;ter, tho at this period full of Piki&s;h affairs.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER IX.</HI> Extent of the Piki&s;h dominions.</HEAD>
<P>THE indu&s;trious and acute Innes, who ought never to be named by a Scoti&s;h antiquary but with &s;uperlative prai&s;e, has treated this part of my &s;ubject &s;uch length, as to leave me little to add. I &s;hall therefore on this one occa&s;ion do little more than ab&s;tract his account; tho with &s;ome corrections.</P>
<P>Tacitus, the mo&s;t ancient author who gives any account of the northern parts of Britain, includes in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the Caledonii, or Piks, all the countries on the north &s;ide of the Tay. Pto|lemy, in his geography, gives us the we&s;tern boundary of the Caledonians on the &s;outh; namely, Lelamonius Sinus, or Loch Fyn. Dio, in his relation of the expedition of Severus into Cale|donia, mentions the Wall of Antoninus, as the boundary between the Caledonians and Maeatae, for the former had, about the year 170, broken the Province of Ve&s;pa&s;iana, and &s;eized all the country down to Forth.</P>
<P>Beda is clear, that the Piks from an early period po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the northern parts beyond the friths, from we&s;t to ea&s;t. For he tells that the frith of Clyde was anciently the boundary of the Britons and Piks<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">I. 1. Yet the Gadeni a part of the Strat-clyde Welch, had Dumbarton&s;hire: but of this pre&s;ently.</NOTE>. And he gives us to know that the
<PB N="315" REF="402">Dalriads at their fir&s;t coming to Britain were re|ceived in a portion of the Piki&s;h territories, <HI>in parte Pictorum,</HI> at the north &s;ide of the frith of Clyde. It is al&s;o clear from Beda, that, in 565, Hy, or Icolmkill, belonged to the Piki&s;h territory, &s;eeing the king of the Piks gave it to Columba. They who would on this occa&s;ion confute Beda from the Annals of Ul&s;ter, a work of the Fifteenth century, which &s;ay the Old Scots gave it to Columba, only &s;hew gro&s;s ignorance of every law concerning hi&s;toric authority. The di&s;tance of time is &s;o great, that the later te&s;timony can in no way confute the former; and the&s;e Annals being written by Iri&s;h churchmen, they would naturally wi&s;h to make Hyona belong to the Old Scots of Iri&s;h extract; and to give them the merit of this &s;aintly donation. It is therefore apparent, that in 565 the Old Scots of Britain only held the &s;outh part of Argyle.</P>
<P>Ammianus Marcellinus, in the fourth century, divides the Piks into Dicaledones and Vecturiones; the former certainly the Northern Piks bordering on the Deucaledonian &s;ea; the later the Southern, as appears from Richard; and their name, which is merely that of the Vikar, or Vichtar, the Ice|landic pronunciation of Pikar, or Pichtar, in a Latin form. Snorro Sturle&s;on, the venerable northern hi&s;torian of the thirteenth century, calls the Old Piks of Norway, <HI>Vikveriar,</HI> or men of Vika; a name very near that of <HI>Vecturiones.</HI> Beda confirms this divi&s;ion of Ammianus, by mention|ing that the Southern Piks, converted by Ninian, were divided from the Northern by high ridges of hills. That is, the Southern Piks were the Lowland Piks; the Northern, the Highland Piks; the two grand divi&s;ions of Scotland in all ages. The&s;e hills were the Grampians, which run from Loch Lomond on the we&s;t, to Aberdeen&s;hire on the ea&s;t.</P>

<P>Adomnan, in a remarkable pa&s;&s;age of his life of Columba, not to be found in the early editions, but Publi&s;hed by Bollandus in his edition about the year 1660, from a fuller MS. and which pa&s;&s;age al&s;o occurs in the invaluable MS. in the King's library, written in the twelfth or thirteenth century, tells us, that the hills of Drum-Albayn were the boundaries between the Piks and Briti&s;h Scots. <HI>Pictorum plebe et Scottorum Britanniae, quos utro&s;que Dor&s;i montes Britannici di&s;terminant.</HI> The <HI>Dor&s;um Britannicum</HI> is a mere Latin tran&s;lation of Drum-Albayn, 'The Back of Britain.'

Innes &s;uppo&s;es Drum-Alban mu&s;t have been in a direct mathematical line, between Hyona and king Brudi's Ca&s;tle, on the river Ne&s;s, near Inverne&s;s; becau&s;e Adomnan &s;ays Columba u&s;ed to pa&s;s it in his way to that ca&s;tle on the Ne&s;s. Of cour&s;e he makes the hills of Drum-Alban run from Athol, North-We&s;t, to the coa&s;t oppo&s;ite to the ile of Skey. But as it is univer&s;ally known to a certainty that Drum-Alban is the highe&s;t part, or mountainous ridge, of Braid-Alban; it is palpable that Columba cro&s;&s;ed from Hyona to the neare&s;t &s;hore, that of Mid Lorn, in a line with Inverary, and from thence pa&s;&s;ed Braid-Alban to Inverne&s;s: a way which common &s;en&s;e points out as the neare&s;t and mo&s;t convenient. Innes &s;eems to imagine that Columba went thro the Ile of Mull, and kept to the northward of Loch Linny, and Loch Ne&s;s. But in this ca&s;e he could
<PB N="317" REF="404">not have pa&s;&s;ed Drum-Alban, and mu&s;t have gone a far way about, thro the region of the Piks: while the other way was nearer; and he went thro the territory of his countrymen to it's extreme frontier, and &s;o pa&s;&s;ed at once to the Piki&s;h court, where the &s;cene of his mi&s;&s;ion lay. Indeed the po&s;ition of Drum-Alban is &s;o well known, that it is needle&s;s to argue the point. In this remarkable pa&s;&s;age, concerning the boundary of the Piks and Dalriadic Scots, Adomnan is &s;peaking of a plague that hap|pened in his own time, about the year 702, when he vi&s;ited Alfred, king of Northumberland, as he him&s;elf, and Beda, tell: which plague, as the pa&s;&s;age bears, vi&s;ited all nations, &s;ave the Piks and Briti&s;h Scots, which were divided from each other by Drum-Alban. That is, the Briti&s;h Scots in the Eighth century were confined to Argyle&s;hire with the Iles of Jura and Ila.</P>

The hi&s;tory of the Hebud Iles is ob&s;cure to exce&s;s, till the Ninth century, when the Norwegians got them. When the Piks ac|quired better habitations in Britain, they &s;eem to have left the Hebud Iles very thinly inhabited; and in the Ninth century we may &s;afely &s;uppo&s;e the Old Scots, or Iri&s;h, were the mo&s;t numerous people in them; and their &s;peech prevailed, as at this day.</P>
<P>The Orkneys, being happily not inhabited by Celts, we know all that can be expected of their hi&s;tory: for while the Celts of the Hebud Iles were di&s;gracing human nature with their &s;econd &s;ight, and other frenzies, the Goths of Orkney lived in day-light and common-&s;en&s;e. It is &s;uffi|cient to ob&s;erve here, that Adomnan &s;hews there was a <HI>regulus,</HI> or prince of the Orkneys, at the court of Brudi, king of the Piks, when Columba vi&s;ited it about 570; and that this prince had given the Piki&s;h &s;overeign ho&s;tages for his fidelity; whence Columba reque&s;ted the king to recommend to this prince the monks then in the Orkneys. Thus it is clear that the Orkneys were &s;ubject to Pikland. Nennius al&s;o, who wrote in 858, &s;hews that the Piks then held the northern ex|tremity of Britain; for he &s;ays the Orkneys were '&s;ituated at the extremity of Britain, beyond the

The life of St. Findan, written by a cotemporary, and publi&s;hed by Golda&s;tus, is an authentic monument of the Ninth century. The author, a companion of the &s;aint, relates that Findan was carried away captive from Ireland; by the Norwegians, about the end of the eighth cen|tury; and that, in going from Ireland to Den|mark, they came to certain ilands called the Ork|neys in the neighbourhood of the Piki&s;h nation, <HI>ad qua&s;dam venere in&s;ulas, juxta Pictorum gentem, quas Orcades vocant</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Golda&s;ti Aleman&punc; rerum Script. Vet. 1606, fol. Vi$a Fin|dani, p. 318.</NOTE>. From an, invaluable monu|ment, publi&s;hed in the &s;econd edition of Wallace's Orkney Iles, London, 1700, being a Diploma of the year 1403, we learn that, when the Norwegians &s;eized the Orkneys in the Ninth century, they found them po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Pets, or Piks, and <HI>Papas.</HI> Who the&s;e Papas were, &s;hall be afterward examined; but it &s;uffices here to add, from that Diploma, that the Orkneys were then called <HI>Terra Petorum,</HI> 'a land of the Piks.' The name of Pentland Frith, called in the Navigation of James V. <HI>Pictland Frith,</HI> al&s;o confirms this. The guttural name of the Piks to be found in, the Saxon Chronicle, and in the vulgar mouth, namely <HI>Pebts,</HI> being hard to pronounce, and &s;omehow inde|finite in the enouncing, <HI>Pent</HI> was in frequent u&s;e &s;ub&s;tituted; whence Pentland hills in the South of Scotland, and Pentland Frith in the furthe&s;t North.</P>
<P>The SOUTHERN extent of the Piki&s;h dominions is rather more difficult to adju&s;t, as being more changeable and ob&s;cure. The point is curious and important; for on it depends the que&s;tion, whether the inhabitants &s;outh of Forth and Clyde be of Engli&s;h or Piki&s;h origin? It therefore de&s;erves
<PB N="320" REF="407">to be examined with care; for tho the Angles and Piks were originally the very &s;ame people, the for|mer being Danes, and from Scandinavia, as were the Piks, yet the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion is intere&s;ting. Im|partiality nece&s;&s;arily attends the &s;ubject; for, let the que&s;tion be determined either way, the people of the &s;outh of Scotland are of Scandinavian origin; and it amounts barely to this, Was the &s;outh of Scotland peopled with Goths, from the north of Scotland, or from the north of England?</P>

The fir&s;t of the&s;e epochs is improper, and ought to have been till the year 426. But Innes al&s;o errs in &s;uppo&s;ing that Tacitus and Ptolemy extend the Caledonians to Clyde and Forth.</P>
<P>There are really FOUR Epochs.</P>
<P>EPOCH I. Tacitus and Ptolemy &s;hew, that the Piks originally extended only to Loch Fyn, and Tay, on the &s;outh. Nor did they reach to the Forth and Wall of Antoninus till Ve&s;pa&s;iana was broken, about the year 170.</P>
<P>EPOCH II. Dio, Gildas, Beda, mark the Forth and Wall of Antoninus, as the &s;outhern boundary of the Piks, from about the year 170, till 426. Beda in one place, <HI>lib.</HI> I. <HI>c.</HI> 1. expre&s;&s;ly mentions the frith of Clyde, as the ancient boundary be|tween the Piks and Britons. But he errs, as is clear from Ptolemy, who puts the <HI>Lelamonius Sinus,</HI> or Loch Fyn, as the &s;outhern boundary of the Caledonians, or Piks, on the we&s;t; and the Clyde never was a boundary of the Piks in any &s;hape. For on the north of the very mouth of Clyde were the Gadeni, a Cumraig people, &s;outh of the <HI>Lelamonius Sinus,</HI> and afterward a part of

<PB N="321" REF="409" MS="Y">the kingdom of Strat-clyde, which, la&s;ted till the tenth century; when, and never before, Dum|barton-&s;hire and the re&s;t of Stratclyde fell into the hands of the Piks, being in fact the very la&s;t ter|ritory which they held. About 258, the Attacotti, or Dalriads, had Cowal, or that part of Argyle &s;hire between Clyde and Loch Fyn, along with other contiguous territory, as Beda him&s;elf &s;ays in this very pa&s;&s;age when he mentions that the Dal|reudini &s;ettled on the <HI>north</HI> of the frith of Clyde; and <HI>lib.</HI> I. <HI>c.</HI> 12. where he de&s;cribes the Briti&s;h Scots as pa&s;&s;ing the Clyde, and the Piks the Forth, to invade the Britons. $hus it is clear from Ptolemy, a far more ancient authority, and from his own te&s;timony in another place, that Beda is mi&s;taken when he mentions the Clyde as a boundary between the Piks and Britons. But if he extends the firth of Clyde to the mull of Cantire, he is right; for the Epidii, a Piki&s;h people, were inhabitants of Cantire before 258, when it was given to the Dalriads. And his de&s;cription of the firth of Clyde, as <HI>&s;inus maris permaximus,</HI> favours this interpretation of his context.</P>
<P>EPOCH III. In the year 425, or 426, as appears from Gildas and Beda, the Piks &s;eized the whole province of Valentia, up to the wall of Gallio, be|tween Solway and Tine. Gildas &s;ays, <HI>cap.</HI> XV. <HI>edit. Bertram,</HI> 1757, 8vo. <HI>Tetri Scotorum, Picto|rumque greges...... omnem aquilonarem, extre|mamque, terrae partem, pro indigenis murotenus cape&s;|&s;unt.</HI> 'The dreadful crouds of Scots and Piks &s;eized, as old inhabitants, the whole northern and extreme part of the land, up to the wall,' namely, of Gallio, as his context &s;hews. And he tells us, <HI>cap.</HI> XIX. that, after writing to Aetius, in 446, without &s;ucce&s;s, the Britons attacked the invaders; and the Scots, or Iri&s;h, went home, but the Piks retained the extreme part of the iland: 'Rever|tuntur ergo impudentes gra&s;&s;atores Hyberni do|mum, po&s;t non multum tempus rever&s;uri. Picti
<PB N="322" REF="410">in extrema parte infulae tunc primum et deinceps requieverunt, praedas et contritiones nonnunquam facientes.' The <HI>extrema pars in&s;ulae</HI> is here univer|&s;ally known to mean the extreme part of the Ro|man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the iland, to wit, the province of Valentia. The friths of Forth and Clyde are, by Gildas and Beda, regarded as &s;eas of &s;epara|tion between the Roman iland, or part of Britain, and the barbarous Piks, and Scots of Argyle. So Beda him&s;elf explains, lib. I. c. 12. &s;peaking of the Piks and the&s;e Scots, <HI>Tran&s;marinas autem dici|mus has gentes, non quod extra Britanniam e&s;&s;ent po|&s;itae, &s;ed quia a parte Britonun erant remotae, duobus finibus maris interja$entibus,</HI> &amp;c. 'We &s;ay the&s;e nations came from beyond the &s;eas, not becau&s;e they were out of Britain; but becau&s;e they were di&s;tant from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Britons, two arms of the &s;ea, lying between, &amp;c.' and he then de&s;cribes the Forth and Clyde.</P>
<P>Beda narrates the&s;e tran&s;actions in the &s;ame way, and generally in the &s;ame words with Gildas.</P>
<P>Thus the Piks got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the province of Valentia: of which, as &s;hall be after &s;hewn, they ever afterward remained the inhabitants. But here a mo&s;t ob&s;cure and difficult que&s;tion occurs, concerning that darke&s;t incident in the ancient hi&s;tory of England, namely, the territory &s;ubdued by Ochra and Ebu&s;a, &s;on and nephew of Hengi&s;t, about the year 460.</P>
<P>This que&s;tion is only ob&s;cure and difficult, be|cau&s; it has never been examined, as indeed no part of the ancient hi&s;tory of England has been. It's full di&s;cu&s;&s;ion is re&s;erved for another place<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Supplement to this work, Sect. I.</NOTE>, where is &s;hewn.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That there is great rea&s;on even to doubt the exi&s;tence of Ochta and Ebu&s;a, they being quite unknown to Beda, the Saxon Chronicle, Ethelwerd, and other the mo&s;t ancient

<ITEM>4. That, in all events, &s;uch &s;ettlement, if it exi&s;ted, was de&s;troyed in a year or two by the Piks.</ITEM>
</LIST>
The reader, who wi&s;hes here to be &s;atisfied of the&s;e points, has only to turn to the Supplement, Sect. I.</P>
<P>Such being the ca&s;e, we may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that till 547, when the great Ida led his Angles in forty &s;hips from the continent, landed at Flam-borough in York&s;hire, and marching north, founded the kingdom of Bernicia, afterward to become the kingdom of all Northumbria; the Piks, far from dimini&s;hing their territory, or re|&s;training their progre&s;s, greatly advanced them. It is evident, from Gildas and Beda, that the Piks in 426 had &s;eized on all the territory down to the wall of Gallio, between Solway and Tine: and that they held that part EVER AFTER, in the words of Gildas, who wrote about 560, in quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; <HI>tunc et</HI> DEINCEPS <HI>requieverunt.</HI> This word <HI>requieverunt</HI> can &s;olely bear &s;uch meaning, for they only re&s;ted, or remained in that acquired province, <HI>pro indigenis,</HI> as fixt inhabitants; but by no means re&s;ted with regard to incur&s;ions on the &s;outh, as that very &s;entence of Gildas, and his &s;ub&s;equent text, bear. Had the Piks been con|tented with the province of Valentia, the Saxons would never have been called in. But when the Britons were quite debilitated by a plague, as Gildas and Beda &s;hew, the Piks taking that ad|vantage carried their arms into the very heart of Britain: and the Belgic Britons, exhau&s;ted by Roman luxury and calamities, found the Piki&s;h hurricane bur&s;t upon their own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions &s;outh of Humber, and were forced to a&s;k a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Jutes, who apparently had landed on their &s;hores
<PB N="324" REF="412">by chance. In 368, when Theodo&s;ius came over, we find that he defeated &s;ome parties of Piks and Scots, in his progre&s;s thro Kent to London<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Amm. Marcell. XXVII. p. 625, edit. Lugd. Bat. 1632 12mo.</NOTE>. In 448 and 449, there is room to think that the Piks had got nearly as far &s;outh, when Hengi&s;t and Hor&s;a arriving in Kent marched again&s;t them, and defeated &s;ome of their advanced parties. Henry of Huntingdon &s;ays the main battle between Hengi&s;t and Hor&s;a, and the Piks, was fought at Stamford in Lincoln-&s;hire, which is but 89 miles north of London. The Piks, it is &s;aid, were defeated. But this is not a little ob&s;cure. Mat|thew of We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;ays, that Hengi&s;t was forced to retire to Germany for &s;ome years. Ac|cording to the common accounts, Hengi&s;t came here in 449, and &s;ent for more Jutes with Rowena his daughter, and Octa his &s;on, in 450; and died in 488, when he could not be le&s;s than 80 years of age. It &s;eems ptobable that Hengi&s;t did return to collect his powerful armament of Jutes, who were to found the kingdom of Kent; and did not arrive with them till about 460, when Carte, an author of indu&s;try, &s;eems rightly to mark the ar|rival of the reinforcement. However this be, all writers, ancient and modern, join in this, that in|&s;tantly after the fir&s;t battle was fought with the Piks, the Jutes, their countrymen, &s;peaking the &s;ame tongue, concluded an alliance with them. This alliance could be founded on no other ba&s;is, than that either party &s;hould retain what lands they could conquer. Beda &s;ays that the Piks were driven &s;omewhat back<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">'Longius pepulerant.' I. 15. The pa&s;&s;age is pre&s;ently produced.</NOTE> at the time of this treaty; and he dates it after the arrival of the reinforce|ment; that is, in 450, according to the common accounts, tho more probably about 460: but this is of no moment, nor are ten years of any con&s;e|quence
<PB N="325" REF="413" MS="Y">in treating of the &s;ettlement of nations. The Piks had advanced as far as Stamford at lea&s;t; and they were driven &s;omewhat back, that is, to the other &s;ide of the Humber. This great Gothic &s;warm pouring from the Caledonian mountains, where they had been long pent up by the exertions of Roman power, now &s;pred like a flood that bur&s;ts a mound. The Brigantes fled from it to the mountains of Cumberland, and the we&s;tern &s;hore: and the Piks certainly &s;eized, as inhabitants, the whole ea&s;tern part, down to the Humber. From 448, to 547, being a century, they held this whole tract as part of their &s;ove|reignty: but from 547 to 685, only as inhabi|tants; after 685, one half of it, being the &s;outhern part of pre&s;ent Scotland, reverted to their monar|chy, and continued to belong to it ever after; as inhabitants of the whole, they remain in their pro|geny to this day.</P>
<P>That the Piks &s;eized all the country down to the Humber is no le&s;s clear, from the deduction nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;ing from the ancient authors, than from this, that, had not &s;uch been the ca&s;e, the &s;peech of all that tract would have been Cumraig, or Welch, at this day; whereas it is more Gothic than that of any other part of England. Ida, who in 547 founded the kingdom of Bernicia; and Aella, who about 559 founded that of Deira in this tract; had not, if both their armies be put together, above 15,000 men. A pretty number to people &s;uch a country! Had the Cumri been then the in|habitants, they might amount to a million; and their &s;peech would infallibly have prevailed, as all know is ever the ca&s;e with the mo&s;t numer|ous people. The Danes afterward were in the &s;ame predicament.</P>
<P>Another circum&s;tance, corroborating the Piki&s;h origin of the Northumbrians, is the decree of the Council of Calcot in Northumbria, held in the year 787, again&s;t that noted practice of the Piks, the painting, or &s;taining, of their bodies. It is
<PB N="326" REF="414" MS="Y">as follows: <HI>Annexuimus ut unu&s;qui&s;que fidelis Chri&s;|tianus a Catholicis juris exemplum accipiat; et, &s;i quid ex ritu Paganorum reman&s;it, avellatur, contemnatur, abjiciatur.

That is, "We al&s;o have added that every faithful Chri&s;tian ought to re|ceive example of law, from the true believers; and that if any thing of Pagan rite remain, it &s;hould be torn off, ce&s;pi&s;ed, and thrown away. For God has formed man fair in per&s;on and hue. But the Pagans, by diabolical in&s;tinct, have covered him with deep marks: as Prudentius &s;ays, 'He has covered the innocent ground with ba&s;e &s;tains.' For he &s;eems to injure the Lord, who &s;tains and defiles his creatures. Certainly if any one receives the injury of this dye for the &s;ake of God, he will receive a great reward therefor. But he who does it from the &s;uper&s;tition of the gentiles, it will nothing avail to his &s;alvation." William of Malm&s;bury indeed tells us that the Angli painted them&s;elves; but he is &s;ingular in this account, un|known to Beda, and the elder writers: and, if they did, it &s;eems mo&s;t rea&s;onable to impure this practice to that of the Piks, among whom they &s;ettled, as the manners of the mo&s;t numerous peo|ple mu&s;t have had much influence.</P>
<P>That the Old Scots had nothing to do in the&s;e inva&s;ions and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions is clear. For in 447, we learn from Gildas and Beda, that they went to Ireland: nor did they return, as &s;hewn in the next part, till 503. Even the Attacotti, or Dal|reudini,
<PB N="327" REF="415" MS="Y">the Old Scots of Argyle, were driven to Ireland at this time, as both Iri&s;h and Scoti&s;h wri|ters confirm. This could only be in con&s;equence of a quarrel between the Piks and Scots; and perhaps concerning the acquired territories. Beda fully in&s;tructs us that the Piks alone were concerned in the&s;e acqui&s;itions; for he tells, <HI>lib.</HI> I. <HI>c.</HI> 15. <HI>Tum &s;ubito inito ad tempus foedere cum Pictis, quos longius jam bellando pepulerant,</HI> &amp;c. 'that Hengi&s;t and Hor&s;a, having formed an alliance with the Piks, whom in the cour&s;e of war they had driven &s;ome|what back,' turned their arms again&s;t the Britons. As to Ethelwerd and William of Malm&s;bury, who for <HI>Piks,</HI> put <HI>Scots,</HI> no man will dream of &s;etting the te&s;timony of writers, who lived four centuries after Beda, again&s;t his. Tho indeed in their time, as after &s;hewn, the very &s;ame people, anciently called Piks, were called Scots.</P>
<P>In 547, Ida founded the kingdom of Bernicia. The Piki&s;h dominions, &s;outh of Forth, were far from the &s;eat of &s;overeignty, and detached by that frith. Their inhabitants being remote from protection, &s;eem willingly to have owned the royalty of Ida, an Angle, their own countryman; and having, for a century, enjoyed a rich country, were mollified enough to prefer a peaceful &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to the new monarch, and his little army. The kingdom of Bernicia, as is clear from Beda, extended up to the frith of Forth, on the northern bound: it's we&s;tern limits are not &s;o clear.

<PB N="328" REF="416">the power of the Bernician, or Northumbrian kings. Beda gives no hint concerning that large tract of country. There is indeed a pa&s;&s;age of Beda, which Smith, in his valuable edition, refers to the country now called Cunningham in Scot|land; and has accordingly in his map marked that country as the Cuningum of Beda. This pa&s;|&s;age occurs, <HI>lib.</HI> V. <HI>c.</HI> 13, where Beda tells the vi&s;ion of a man in Cuningum, who afterwards be|came a monk of Melro&s;e: and it is <HI>Erat autem vir, in regione Nordanhumbrorum quoe vocatur Incuningum, religio&s;am cum domo &s;ua gerens vitam;</HI> but the Saxon tran&s;lation, by Alfred, has <HI>Cununingum.</HI> Yet Beda unfortunately gives no hint where this region was; and Smith's idea is a mere conjecture, for it may have been &s;ome di&s;trict in the north of Eng|land. Names fluctuate and change; and it is dangerous to build on a name only, without any de&s;cription: not to mention that the real name given by Beda, namely, <HI>Incuningum,</HI> is very dif|ferent from <HI>Cuningham.</HI> The continuator of Beda tells us that, in the year 750, <HI>Eadbertus campum Cyil cum aliis regionibus, &s;uo regno addidit,</HI> 'Eadbert added the field Cyil, with other regions, to his kingdom.' Milton<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Eng. p. 175.</NOTE> interprets this to be Kyle; and ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, from the &s;ame continuator, that in 740 Edbert, king of Northumberland, was occupied in war again&s;t the Piks; and that this acqui&s;ition &s;hews it was &s;ucce&s;sful. Now the event mentioned by Beda, as happening in the country called Incuningum, falls about the year 696, eleven years after the Piks regained their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions from the Northumbrians. If therefore Cunning|ham, a country immediately on the north of Kyle, belonged to the Northumbrians &s;till in 696, i cannot &s;ee how Edbert in 750 &s;hould acquire Kyle from the Piks. For the Piks did not, as ap|pears, enlarge their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Galloway, from
<PB N="329" REF="417">685, till about 820, when they &s;eized Candida Ca&s;a, and all the &s;outh, upon the decline of the Northumbrian kingdom, as William of Malm|&s;bury &s;hews<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ge&s;t. Pont. Ang. lib. III.</NOTE>. At the &s;ame time it is very probable that the Piks of Cunningham and Kyle were &s;ub|ject to the Northumbrian crown in 696; and that, between that year and 740, they had thrown off the yoke: and that in 750, Edbert, the la&s;t war|like monarch of Northumbria, while in Anglic power, recovered Kyle, and perhaps Cunningham. In 756, we know that Edbert joined Ungu&s;t I. king of the Piks, in reducing Stratclyde; which &s;eems to indicate that his domains bordered on that kingdom, as well as tho&s;e of Ungu&s;t, and that they united their arms for reciprocal advantage. Now Edbert's kingdom did not border on Strat|clyde on the ea&s;t and north, territories belonging to the Piks; but certainly did on the &s;outh of Stratclyde, and, if he had Kyle and Cunningham, on the we&s;t. It &s;eems certain that Ungu&s;t I. one of the brave&s;t princes who ever held the Piki&s;h &s;ceptre, and who had ju&s;t confirmed and enlarged his power by the conque&s;t of Dalriada, would not have joined Edbert, if this monarch had con|quered any part of his own territory, but would have turned his arms again&s;t him. Hence it ap|pears that the Piks, again&s;t whom Edbert made war, were tho&s;e of Galloway, who had a&s;&s;umed independence, both of the Northumbrian and Piki&s;h crowns. Nor is there any di&s;pute between Ungu&s;t I. and the Northumbrians, mentioned by any writer, Engli&s;h or Iri&s;h. As Beda, after men|tioning the acqui&s;itions of the Piki&s;h crown in the &s;outh of Scotland 685, is &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;peak of Cunningham, as &s;ubject to the Northumbrians in 696, and implies that all things remained in the &s;ame condition 731, when he clo&s;ed his work; it might &s;eem that, about 740, the Piks in Gal|loway
<PB N="330" REF="418">rebelled, that Edbert made war on them, and in 750 re-annexed them to his dominions. And that about 820, on the fall of the Northum|brian kingdom, they &s;eized all Galloway, and became quite independant both of the Engli&s;h and Piki&s;h kingdoms, till the Twelfth century. At the &s;ame time the word <HI>addidit,</HI> in the pa&s;&s;age above adduced, is again&s;t this interpretation, and im|plies that Kyle was a new acqui&s;ition: which in|duces me &s;till to he&s;itate if <HI>Incuningum</HI> be <HI>Cunning|ham;</HI> and the reader mu&s;t excu&s;e my writing un|certainly on an uncertain &s;ubject. Being quite &s;eparated from the Piki&s;h monarchy by the king|doms of Strat-Clyde and Dalriada, the Piks of this province had their own chiefs, who were in time to be the powerful princes of Galloway. In an old charter, Irvin<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Goodal. Introd. Fordun. c. 10. Dalrymple's Annal. Ao. 1160.</NOTE> is &s;aid to be in Galloway; and Jocelin, who compiled his life of Kentigern from two old lives, &s;peaks of the Piks in Gal|loway as a detached people, when Kentigern lived, or in the Sixth century. And even in the Twelfth century the princes of Galloway were only feuda|tory to the Scoti&s;h king.<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Dalrymple's Annal. Ao 1160. ex Chron. Stae Crucis.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>EPOCH IV. In 685 the Piki&s;h monarchy acquired that extent to the &s;outh which it was ever after to hold. That year Egfrid king of Northumberland being defeated and &s;lain by the Piks, a great revo|lution followed. Beda &s;ays, <HI>Ex quo tempore &s;pes coepit et virtus regni Anglorum fluere, ac retro &s;u|blap&s;a referri. Nam et Picti</HI> TERRAM POSSESSIONIS SUAE, <HI>quam tenuerunt Angli; et Scotti qui erant in Britannia, et Britonum quoque pars nonnulla,</HI> LIBER|TATEM <HI>receperunt, quam et hactenus habent per an|nos circiter quadraginta &s;ex.</HI> 'From which time the hope and virtue of the kingdom of the Angli began to melt, and flow backward. For the Piks
<PB N="331" REF="419">recovered the LAND OF THEIR POSSESSION, which the Angli had held: and the Scots who were in Britain, and a &s;mall part of the Britons, recovered their LIBERTY, which they hold &s;till, being a &s;pace of about Forty-&s;ix years.' A memorable pa&s;&s;age! Saint O&s;wald king of Northumberland, who had lived in Ireland and Pikland, before he a&s;cended the throne in 634, carried the Northumbrian power to great height. Before his death in 642, after a reign of only eight years, he was, &s;ays Cuminius, <HI>Im|perator totius Britanniae,</HI> 'Emperor of all Britain:' and according to Beda, <HI>lib.</HI> III. <HI>c.</HI> 6. <HI>Denique omnes nationes et provincias Britanniae, quae in qua|tuor linguas, id e&s;t, Britonum, Pictorum, Scottorum, Anglorum, divi&s;ae &s;unt, in aitione accepit.</HI> 'He received in &s;ubjection all the nations and provinces of Britain, which are divided into four languages, that of the Britons, of the Piks, of the Scots, of the Engli&s;h.' Such were the happy fruits of a king's being a &s;aint! The truth is, that the two predece&s;&s;ors of Saint O&s;wald had done what the&s;e writers did not approve, in extirpating the Chri&s;|tian religion from their dominions, which O&s;wald re&s;tored, and went to the other extreme, by call|ing in Iri&s;h churchmen, and giving religion every encouragement; him&s;elf a &s;aint, who&s;e miracles Beda relates at much length. Yet was O&s;wald cer|tainly a victorious prince, as his re&s;toring Nor|thumbria to one great and powerful monarchy proves; and the above panegyrics, tho given by an Iri&s;h and an Engli&s;h churchman, in exce&s;s of gratitude and zeal, were not without grounds. He gained a bloody battle again&s;t Caedwalla, king of the Britons, or Welch: the Britons of Strat-Clyde were al&s;o &s;ubject to the kings of Northumbria, as the above pa&s;&s;age of Beda, only applicable to them, indicates: as were their neighbours the Dalriadic Scots; two &s;mall kingdoms that required &s;upport again&s;t the Piki&s;h power. Cuminius was a Scot who wrote in Hyona, about 657, when he was abbot of that place; and in that character, and
<PB N="332" REF="420">as a cotemporary of O&s;wald, is an infallible witne&s;s that the Briti&s;h Scots acknowleged the Imperial power of Saint O&s;wald. But as to the Piks, it is &s;u&s;pected the fable of the lion and the man might be applied. They had no painters of hi&s;tory. The a&s;&s;ertion with regard to them is as ridiculous as with regard to the re&s;t of England, who&s;e &s;ix other kingdoms never acknowleged this emperor. That Pikland, a monarchy of four times the &s;ize of Northumbria, and impracticable to it's power, &s;hould have been &s;ubject to it's &s;aintly king, is in|credible. O&s;wald had been educated in Pikland and Ireland, as Beda tells; and among his favours to the Old Scots, or Iri&s;h, certainly was not &s;o un|grateful to the Piks, as to u&s;urp any title of au|thority over them. It is however extremely pro|bable that the independent Piks of Galloway might join the Briti&s;h Scots, and Strat Clyde Britons, their neighbours, in acquiring the friend&s;hip of &s;o powerful a prince as O&s;wald, by acknowleging him lord paramount. The panegyric given to him is a monki&s;h rant, but not void of foundation.</P>
<P>There is a curious pa&s;&s;age in the Appendix to Nennius, which is thought to have been written in the Tenth century, by a Northumbrian, as it relates to Northumbrian hi&s;tory. It &s;ays: 'This is the Egfrid who made war again&s;t his brother-in-law, the king of the Piks, by name Brudi, and fell with all the flower of his army, the Piks with their king being victorious. And the Saxons never &s;ent a devouring tax-gatherer to exact tribute of the Piks, from the time of that war, which is called Guerchlumgaran<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Echfrid ip&s;e e&s;t qui fecit bellum contra fratruelem &s;uum, qui erat Rex Pictorum nomine Bridei; et ibi corruit cum omni robore exercitus &s;ui; et Picti cum rege &s;uo victores ex|titerunt. ht nunquam addiderunt Saxones ambronem, ut a Pictis vectigal exigerent, a tempore i&s;tius belli: vocatur Guerchlumgaran. <HI>Nen.

He &s;peaks of the Piks as <HI>gentes innumerae,</HI> and &s;ays two rivers were filled with their &s;lain.</P></NOTE>.' General expre&s;&s;ions argue
<PB N="333" REF="421">little; but the information here is particular, that the Northumbrian kings u&s;ed to receive tribute from the Piks. A writer more anxious for the cau&s;e of the Piks, than for that of truth, might argue that only the &s;outhern Piks of Lothian paid this tribute: but there is room to believe that the king of the Piks paid this tribute to the Northum|brian monarchs from O&s;wald's time, 634, and that the above authorities of Cuminius and Beda are much to be credited. The Northumbrian kingdom, the greate&s;t of the heptarchy, and the name of who&s;e &s;ubjects, Angli, prevailed over all the re&s;t, was &s;uperior to the Piki&s;h in wealth and arts. The Saxon Annals &s;ay that O&s;wi brother of O&s;wald, and his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, in 658, &s;ubdued all Mercia, and the greate&s;t part of the Piki&s;h nation. This accounts for the tribute, ari&s;ing mo&s;t probably from the con|que&s;ts of O&s;wi, and not from the fanctity of O&s;wald.</P>
<P>Beda, in the above pa&s;&s;age, &s;ays the Piks re|covered their POSSESSIONS; but the Briti&s;h Scots, and Strat Clyde Britons, their LIBERTY. In the dark ages, when Beda lived, it was thought that the Angli, Saxons, and Jutes, had actually peo|pled their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Britain! It was thought that Ida's 10,000 men had peopled a territory, who&s;e inhabitants could not be much le&s;s than a million! This ignorance is now matter of laughter. Beda means &s;imply that the Piki&s;h nation re|covered their ancient property, <HI>a land of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,</HI> inhabited by them&s;elves, tho long &s;ub|ject to another crown. But how far &s;outh did this po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion extend? It is clear from Beda, that in 731, when he wrote, Candida Ca&s;a, or Whitherne, was in the hands of the Engli&s;h. So Mailros on
<PB N="334" REF="422">the &s;outh bank of the Tweed &s;eems al&s;o to have been<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Beda IV. 27, V. 13. In his life of St. Cuthbert, Beda mentions <HI>terra Pictorum Ned&s;air,</HI> or, as other MSS. <HI>Niduari,</HI> to which the &s;aint went in a ve&s;&s;el from Carlile. This appears to have been on the river Nid.</NOTE>. If therefore a line be drawn along the cour&s;e of the Tweed from Berwick, and that of the river Etteric in a we&s;t direction to the river Stinfar, between Wigton and Air&s;hire, it will form as accurate a bound, as can be given in a de|bateable march, of the Piki&s;h and Bernician po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions from 685, till 793, when the Danes fir&s;t invaded Northumbria. About which time, or &s;oon after, during the confu&s;ions of the Dani&s;h &s;ettlers in Northumbria, which la&s;ted near two centuries, the independent Piks of Galloway ex|tended their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions into pre&s;ent Wigton and Kircudbright &s;hires, parts of old Galloway, while tho&s;e on the ea&s;t &s;eized pre&s;ent Roxburgh and Dumfries &s;hires, the pre&s;ent &s;outhern limits of Scotland: as compactly and naturally bounded by the Tweed and E&s;k, on the Ea&s;t and We&s;t; and mountains of Cheviot in the middle.</P>
<P>In 756, Ungu&s;t, king of the Piks, and Edbert king of Northumbria, joined their arms, and be|&s;ieged Alclyde, or Dunbarton, capital of the kingdom of Strat Clyde, which &s;urrendered on terms of tribute to both kings, as would &s;eem. But the Britons retained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion as el&s;ewhere &s;hewn.</P>
<P>The Northumbrians naturally gave the name of Angli to all their &s;ubjects, tho in fact Piks, as Beda gives repeatedly the &s;ame name of Angli to the very people, who, he tells us expre&s;&s;ly, were Saxons, or Jutes. Thus Beda &s;ays the Forth divided the Angli from the Piks, that is, the An|glic kingdom of Northumbria from the Piki&s;h. But that part of Bernicia which adjoined to the Piki&s;h kingdom was e&s;pecially called <HI>Provincia Pictorum,</HI> and it's inhabitants Piks, even while it
<PB N="335" REF="423">was under the Bernician monarchs, as is clear from Beda<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">IV. 26. Carta ap. Langhorne, Chron. Reg. Angl. p. 236.</NOTE>. Trumwin, the bi&s;hop of the&s;e Piks, re&s;ided at Abercorn, nine miles we&s;t from Edin|burgh. That the Bernician or Northumbrian kings never had any territory beyond the firth of Forth, is certain from Beda, and all the ancient writers. The Piks, over whom Trumwin was bi&s;hop, were the Piks of Lothian; as the bi&s;hop of Whitherne pre&s;ided over tho&s;e &s;outh parts of Galloway, which were &s;ubject to the Angli. But of this in the chapter of Eccle&s;ia&s;tic Hi&s;tory. The hi&s;tory of Northumbria is known to be very ob|&s;cure. It is highly probable that Ida's acqui&s;ition did not extend over Lothian, the we&s;tern part of which was the frontier province of the ancient Piki&s;h kingdom, and main entrance to it; &s;o that it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that tract was long and warmly conte&s;ted by the Piki&s;h and Northumbrian mo|narchs. Therefore it &s;eems to have been a late ad|dition to the later kingdom; and being &s;pecially and more lately won from the Piki&s;h monarchy, it was called a Piki&s;h province, and it's inhabitants Piks. Roger Hoveden, in his account of the battle of the &s;tandard 1138, calls tho&s;e people <HI>Lodonen&s;es,</HI> or of Lothian, whom other ancient writers call <HI>Picti.</HI> Roger of Che&s;ter, mentioning Edinburgh, &s;ays it was <HI>in terra Pictorum,</HI> in the land of the Piks. A ridge of hills running thro Mid Lothian is &s;till called Pentland Hills, as the frith to the North of Scotland is called Pentland frith; of which above.</P>
<P>To return for a moment to Galloway: the hi&s;|tory of that country, anciently &s;o noted, is rather ob|&s;cure. The Piks, in pouring from Caledonia down to the Humber, preferred the fertile provinces of the ea&s;t to the we&s;tern hills. When Ida came in and founded the kingdom of Bernicia, A. C. 547, &s;ome of the Piks, preferring the roving indepen|dence of mountaineers, &s;eem to have retired to the
<PB N="336" REF="424" MS="Y">we&s;tern parts of Galloway. The duration of the kingdom of Strat Clyde may &s;eem remarkable, for it lay in a plain and fertile country, &s;urrounded by hills, &s;o that it might be expected to have fallen a prey to &s;urrounding enemies. But this very cir|cum&s;tance of it's being between two powerful foes, the Piks and Angli, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have protected it, and it did not &s;ubmit till Piks and Angli joined again&s;t it in 756. Till the Angli came in 547, the Piks were occupied in the rich and fertile provinces of England, as we have &s;een. Even in the mountains of Argyle, they allowed the Briti&s;h Scots to re-&s;ettle in 503. Alclud had been well fortified by Theodo&s;ius; and the &s;trength of the capital naturally defended the &s;tate. Around it the mo&s;t warlike Britons, tho&s;e of Valentia the frontier, were a&s;&s;embled; and were &s;o &s;trong that it required the joint armies of Piks and Angli to bring them to terms. The&s;e circum&s;tances con|&s;idered, we need not wonderthat this &s;mall &s;tate, like many others, long exi&s;ted among powerful neighbours. The Piks of Galloway lay beyond it on the &s;outh-we&s;t among numerous mountains; but, contented with &s;elf-defence, they were not powerful enough to attempt the conque&s;t of Strat Clyde. The&s;e Piks were them&s;elves &s;ometimes tributary to the Northumbrian monarchs, who&s;e dominions extended all along their &s;outhern fron|tier. William of Malm&s;bury and Roger of Che&s;ter te&s;tify, that upon the decay of the Northumbrian kingdom, about the year 820, Whitherne and the&s;e &s;outhern parts were taken from the Angli by the Piks. And it is likely that about the &s;ame time they re-annexed to their domains pre&s;ent Roxburgh and Dumfries &s;hires. The name of Galloway al&s;o occurs in an Iri&s;h province Galway. The etymology of names is altogether fooli&s;h and uncertain; but it may ju&s;t be hinted that the name of Galloway is unknown till the eleventh century, till when, and after, the Iri&s;h churchmen were the

<P>It may be proper, before clo&s;ing this chapter, to give a hint or two concerning the &s;ettlements of the Piks in Ireland. Mr. O'Conor, in his map, marks two colonies of Crutheni, the one in the northern extremity of Ireland, the other in Gal|way. From Probus, in his life of St. Patrick, and Adomnan, in that of St. Columba, it is al&s;o clear that there were con&s;iderable &s;ettlements of the Crutheni, or Piks, in Ireland. The Piki&s;h Chronicle, as we have &s;een, dates their &s;ettlement in the time of Brudi I. or about 210, which
<PB N="338" REF="427" MS="Y">&s;eems very probable. The extent and hi&s;tory of the&s;e &s;ettlements are unknown, but they mu&s;t have been pretty con&s;iderable. Adomnan mentions Echuvi&s;laid, a king of the northern Crutheni. The Welch writers call them <HI>Gwydhyl Phictiaid,</HI> or Iri&s;h Piks. Price, in his de&s;cription of Wales, tells from Welch annals, that about 540, the&s;e Iri&s;h Piks, and the Iri&s;h Scots, ravaged the &s;hores of Cardigan; and then the ile of Maun, whence they were driven by Ca&s;walhon Lhawhir, or Ca&s;|walhon with the long hand, who &s;lew Serigi, their king, with his own hand<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ware, in his notes to the Fragments of St. Patrick, &s;ays, "Praeter Pictos Albanien&s;es, qui in Annalibus Ultonien&s;ibus nonnunquam Picti, &s;ed plerumque Cruithnei, appellantur, erant et olim Picti quidem Hibernici, qui Cruithnei etiam vocabantur.

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER X.</HI> The Piki&s;h Language.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY one, who has been in North Britain, knows that the Lowlanders of that country are as different from the Highlanders, as the Eng|li&s;h are from the Welch. The race is &s;o extremely di&s;tinct as to &s;trike all at fir&s;t &s;ight. In per&s;on the Lowlanders are tall and large, with fair com|plexions, and often with flaxen, yellow, and red hair, and blue eyes; the grand features, of the Goths, in all ancient writers. The Highlanders are generally diminutive, if we except &s;ome of Norwegian de&s;cent; with brown complexions, and almo&s;t always with black curled hair, and dark eyes. In mind and manners the di&s;tinction is as marked. The Lowlanders are acute, indu&s;trious, &s;en&s;ible, erect, free. The Highlanders &s;tupid, indolent, fooli&s;h, fawning, &s;lavi&s;h. The former in &s;hort have every attribute of a civilized people. The later are ab&s;olute &s;avages: and, like Indians and Negroes, will ever continue &s;o. For a peo|ple, which has continued &s;avage from their origin till now, will infallibly remain &s;o till the race be lo&s;t by mixture. Their &s;avage indolence forbids all ideas of cultivation. Their want of indu&s;try is the cau&s;e that they have no towns: their want of towns, the cau&s;e that they have no indu&s;try. The&s;e cau&s;es act reciprocally and infinitely. If
<PB N="341" REF="430">towns were built for them, they would not inha|bit them. In vain do we dream of building towns in their territories. If peopled with Highlanders they will be in ruins in half a century. Norway is not a &s;uperior country to the Highlands of Scot|land. But what a difference! The one &s;warms with indu&s;try and towns: the other is a de&s;ert. Had all the&s;e Celtic cattle emigrated five centuries ago, how happy had it been for the country! All we can do is to plant colonies among them; and by this, and encouraging their emigration, try to get rid of the breed.</P>
<P>The Lowlanders amount to two thirds of the inhabitants of Scotland: and, if all hi&s;tory were utterly extingui&s;hed, we &s;hould know to a cer|tainty from their per&s;ons, manners, and language, that they came from the oppo&s;ite continent. Of that continent the &s;outh of Norway is by much the neare&s;t part to Scotland; and plain &s;en&s;e would lead us to conclude they came from thence. Language is of all others the &s;ure&s;t mark of the origin of nations. Had the Lowlanders of Scot|land been originally Celts, either Gael, or Cumri, no change, or chance, could have introduced the Gothic tongue among them. In vain do &s;ome of our &s;uperficial writers dream that they received their tongue from their &s;outhern neighbours: and to &s;uch a degree has their ignorance gone, as to think that, when Malcolm III. married an Eng|li&s;h prince&s;s, the Engli&s;h became the court, and then the common language! A language pa&s;s from a &s;core of people to more than a million! If any foreigner of learning happens to peru&s;e this work, he will be apt to think that i have created a &s;hadow to fight with. But the ca&s;e is real: and &s;uch is the &s;tate of learning at pre&s;ent in Scotland! That the Lowlanders of Scotland were not Celts, who, received their &s;peech from their &s;outhern neighbours, requires no proof; as no &s;uch matter ever happened in any period, or country. The
<PB N="342" REF="431" MS="Y">Celts are, like all &s;avages, mo&s;t tenacious of their &s;peech and manners. In Ireland, where there were numerous &s;ettlements of Engli&s;h, the Engli&s;h &s;peech was &s;o far from prevailing, that ordinances were obliged to be given<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Iri&s;h Statutes: and &s;ee Spen&s;er's State of Ireland. Lynche, in his <HI>Cambren&s;is Ever&s;us,</HI> &s;ays, 'Barnab. Rich, De&s;cr. Hib. p. 34, author e&s;t decem Anglos citius Hibernorum &s;e moribus accommodare, quam unum Hibernum Anglorum ritus am|plecti.' The cau&s;e is evident, for the indolent life of a &s;avage has &s;upreme charms for the vulgar, who in advanced &s;ociety are forced to work for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, but in uncivili&s;ed need only hunt, or &s;teal.</NOTE> again&s;t adoption of the Celtic dre&s;s and language, which were prevailing over the Engli&s;h; as tho&s;e of the mo&s;t numerous people always do. The people of the plains of Ireland &s;peak the Ga&euml;lic, as well as tho&s;e of the mountains; and in the mo&s;t mountainous part of Ireland, the north, Engli&s;h, and Scoti&s;h, are chiefly &s;poken, while Celtic is the &s;peech of the &s;outhern and midland plains. If &s;uch be the ca&s;e with Ire|land, a country conquered by the Engli&s;h, and widely colonized by them; what mu&s;t have been the ca&s;e in Scotland, a country unconquered, and uncolonized, and ever inimical to England, till the happy junction of the Crowns? Had the Low|landers of Scotland been Celts, they would have viewed the Engli&s;h language with utter abhorrence and aver&s;ion. But this need not be in&s;i&s;ted on; as, putting all hi&s;tory a&s;ide, we have infallible marks that they are not Celts but Goths.</P>
<P>More plau&s;ible, tho fooli&s;h to exce&s;s, is the opinion of tho&s;e who think the Lowlanders of Scotland real Saxons from England. Such &s;ay that the &s;outhern parts belonged to the Northum|brian kingdom, and were peopled with Saxons (they mean Angles), along with the re&s;t of that kingdom. That this could not be the ca&s;e is clear: for Ida's army did not exceed 10,000 men, of which not one quarter could be &s;ettled in
<PB N="343" REF="432" MS="Y">the &s;outh of Scotland, if any &s;ettled there at all. The Lothians are by Beda called <HI>Provincia Picto|rum;</HI> and Trumwin, who&s;e &s;ee was there, was <HI>Epi&s;copus Pictorum.</HI> When the Piks, in 685, re|covered all the &s;outh of Scotland, Beda &s;ays they regained, or re-annexed to their crown, <HI>terram po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ionis &s;uae,</HI> 'the land of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion;' which &s;hews it was always po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by them, tho &s;ubject to the Northumbrian kings. In all events the phra&s;e po&s;itively forbids any interpretation, that, after 685, the Angli had any footing there. But this is vain argumentation, for it has been &s;hewn above that the Piks, a Gothic &s;warm, long confined by Roman power, as &s;oon as that mound was removed, bur&s;t like a torrent over the fertile plains of England, and peopled that country down to the Humber; tho their name, like that of the Belgae, was lo&s;t in that of the new, invaders, long before Beda wrote. In pre&s;ent Renfrew, and Lanerk&s;hire, it is clear that the Angles never had any footing. No towns, or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, there are ever mentioned by Beda. In Air&s;hire the Piks of Galloway, mentioned by Jocelin, lived: the king|dom of Strat Clyde &s;pred over the re&s;t. But &s;o gro&s;s is our ignorance, that the Piks, &s;o remark|able in the Roman page, and in that of Beda and the other early writers, are totally forgotten by our &s;cribblers, who do not read to di&s;cover facts, as the antiquaries of other countries do, but are con|tented to &s;leep in their mental night, and dream dreams. The dominion of a country is totally different from the population of it. The inhabi|tants of Scotland, &s;outh of the friths, mu&s;t amount to half a million; and it is que&s;tioned, if ancient population was greater than modern. But no one can ever imagine that a quarter of Ida's army, or 2,500 men, could have peopled that tract in two centuries, or before Beda's time. The que&s;tion is, who were then the inhabitants, among whom
<PB N="344" REF="433">tho&s;e 2,500 men were as a drop in the &s;ea? It has been &s;hewn, from Gildas and Beda, that they were Piks.</P>
<P>But how came the Gothic language to be &s;poken all along the Ea&s;tern Lowlands of Scotland, up to it's extremity? This puzzles our p&s;eudo-anti|qui&s;ts. One<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Mr. Macpher&s;on, Introd. to Hi&s;t. of Brit. and Irel. p. 91.</NOTE> will have it that Saxon merchants &s;ettled there, and &s;o the thing came about by God's permi&s;&s;ion. What a pretty <HI>bull!</HI> See what it is to have Celtic intelligence! Saxon merchants! Merchants introduce a language! To an&s;wer &s;uch non&s;en&s;e, would be to in&s;ult the reader's under|&s;tanding. Others, not quite &s;o ab&s;urd, &s;ay that, at the Norman conque&s;t, many of the Engli&s;h fled into Scotland, where they introduced their language. But tho&s;e Engli&s;h were people of rank; and it is known, that French was then the language &s;poken by &s;uch in England before the Conque&s;t<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Warton's Hi&s;t. of Engli&s;h poetry, Vol. I.</NOTE>; &s;o, if by a &s;pecial miracle, a hundred or two had &s;pred their &s;peech among a million of the common people, that &s;peech would have been the French. And, after all, king Dovenald Ban, 1093, obliged all the&s;e foreigners to leave the kingdom<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Dalrymple's Annals.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But there are two pa&s;&s;ages of ancient Engli&s;h hi&s;torians which de&s;erve e&s;pecial notice.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is of Simeon of Durham, who wrote about 1164. He &s;ays, that after Malcolm III. had ravaged the Engli&s;h frontiers in 1070, the pri&s;oners were &s;o many, 'that Scotland is filled with male and female &s;ervants of Engli&s;h race; &s;o that, even at this day, i will not &s;ay no little vil|lage, but not even a hovel can be found without them<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Simeon Dun. Col. 201. &s;ub Anno 1070. 'Repleta e&s;t ergo Scotia &s;ervis et ancillis Anglici generis; ita ut, etiam u&s;que hodie, nulla non dico villula, &s;ed nec domuncula, &s;ine his valeat inveniri.'</NOTE>. But &s;uppo&s;ing the&s;e pri&s;oners to amount
<PB N="345" REF="434" MS="Y">to 100,000, that number could not have intro|duced a language among a million of people; for, if a language is perpetuated, it is an infallible &s;ign, that tho&s;e who &s;peak it are the mo&s;t numer|ous: &s;o that more than a million of pri&s;oners would have been required to effectuate this. A maid, or man &s;ervant, in every hut, mu&s;t have &s;poken as the family did; but no man can &s;uppo&s;e that the family a&s;&s;umed the &s;peech of it's &s;ervant. When the Franks poured into Gaul, and the other Goths into Italy, Spain, &amp;c. the people were to them as twenty to one, and the &s;peech of the old inhabitants overcame of cour&s;e. In &s;uch in&s;tances the language of the inferior people prevails, from their numbers: but the ca&s;e is widely different here. The&s;e Engli&s;h captives, as &s;uch, were for the time inferior to their ma&s;ters; but their numbers were comparatively &s;o few, that it is impo&s;&s;ible their &s;peech could prevail. Inferior in numbers, as in &s;ituation, their language would rather be matter of aver&s;ion and deri&s;ion, than of imitation; and no doubt, at the very fir&s;t, they tried to accommodate even their dialect to that of their ma&s;ters, in order to abandon an odious di&s;tinction, and to conciliate favour. That pri|&s;oners &s;hould introduce a language into a country, would be a phaenomenon in hi&s;tory, totally un|known in ancient or modern times, and cannot be admitted even in theory, far le&s;s in fact.</P>
<P>The other pa&s;&s;age is extremely curious, and &s;ingular. It is of William of Newburgh, who wrote about the year 1200. He &s;ays, 'There was in the army of William, king of Scots [1173], a great number of Engli&s;h; for the towns and boroughs of the Scoti&s;h kingdom are known to be inhabited by the Engli&s;h. The Scots, taking the occa&s;ion o the king's ab&s;ence, revealed their innate hatred again&s;t them, which they had di&s;&s;embled for fear of the king; and &s;lew as many as they could find, tho&s;e who could e&s;cape flying to the
<PB N="346" REF="435">royal ca&s;tles<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Lib. II. c. 34. 'Erat in Gulielmi Scotorum regis exercitu ingens Anglorum numerus: regni enim Scottici oppida et burgi ab Anglis habitari no&s;cuntur. Occa&s;ione ergo temporis Scotti innatum, &s;ed metu regio di&s;&s;imulatum, in illos odium declarantes, quotquot incidebant perimerunt; refugientibus in munitiones i egias ceteris qui evadere potuerunt.'</NOTE>.' Malcolm III. 1056, and Edgar, 1098, were married to Engli&s;h ladies, as were Alexander I. and David I. The&s;e princes had a natural and laudable favour for the Engli&s;h; and, being &s;en&s;ible of their &s;uperiority in the arts of life, had apparently u&s;ed all means to induce them to &s;ettle in their kingdom, and forward the&s;e arts there. The knowlege of the&s;e arts had gradually pa&s;t from the &s;outh: from Italy to France, from France to England, and &s;o from England to Scot|land. In the countries more immediately Gothic borough towns are of late origin. In Germany they are not older than the reign of Henry the Falconer, or about 930. In France, boroughs or corporation towns were introduced by Louis the Gro&s;s, about 1120. But it is to be &s;u&s;pected that they pa&s;&s;ed from Germany to England. At any rate, borough towns and corporations are not older in England than the eleventh century at mo&s;t: and they &s;eem almo&s;t in&s;tantly to have pa&s;t from thence into Scotland. The Scoti&s;h mo|narchs, with a patriotic view of advancing the intere&s;ts of their kingdom, gave boroughs with due privileges to Engli&s;h merchants, trade&s;men and mechanics, in like manner as the Engli&s;h did to French and Flemi&s;h. The&s;e towns and boroughs mu&s;t be carefully di&s;tingui&s;hed from the old towns, which even in England were no better than vil|lages, without any privileges or corporations what|ever. As the Engli&s;h monarchs gave &s;uch boroughs to the Flemings, and other foreigners, for the advantage of mechanics and commerce; &s;o did the Scoti&s;h to the Engli&s;h. The Danes and Swedes are, in like manner, indebted for their early
<PB N="347" REF="436">boroughs, commerce and arts, to German merchants from the Han&s;e, and other towns of the north of Ger|many: and the&s;e advantages were unknown to Den|mark, Norway, and Sweden, till the Thirteenth cen|tury, for &s;uch was their gradual progre&s;s northward. Now the&s;e burghs and towns, inhabited by the Engli&s;h, could never exceed Fifty; tho half that number will appear nearer the matter to tho&s;e who know how few &s;uch were in Scotland till the time of the Stuarts. And any one who knows how &s;mall even Edinburgh, the capital, was before that time, will think that the medium of 1000 Engli&s;h to each town will exceed, and not fall &s;hort of, the truth. Say then there were 50,000 Engli&s;h inhabitants of burghs and towns, and 100,000 Engli&s;h captives u&s;ed as &s;ervants in Scot|land, in the Twelfth century, the number will be 150,000. But even imagining this prodigious number, which every cool enquirer will allow to be in all probability double the truth, their language would in that of a million, or 1,100,000 people, the real amount of the Scoti&s;h Lowlanders, be as nothing. The&s;e Lowlanders, far from even imitating their language, would dete&s;t it as foreign and inimical, as this very pa&s;&s;age of Newburgh too plainly proves; and the Engli&s;h would rather abandon their dialect as an odious de&s;tinction, than &s;pred it thro the country. In England the French and Flemings introduced no language, but on the con|trary &s;oon lo&s;t their own. In Denmark, Sweden, Norway, the Germans made no alteration on the language. An author would be regarded as of un|&s;ound mind in tho&s;e countries, if he were to ad|vance &s;o weak a dream. The analogy as to Scot|land is po&s;itive, direct, and mathematical.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid that &s;ome Danes may have &s;ettled in the ea&s;t parts of Scotland, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in bringing in the Gothic tongue. But this is not only <HI>gratis dictum,</HI> without one &s;hadow of the &s;malle&s;t authority, but can be &s;hewn to be ab&s;o|lutely
<PB N="348" REF="437">fal&s;e. The Norwegians, along with the Orkneys, held Caithne&s;s, Sutherland, and a part of Ro&s;s, for &s;ome time. Sigurd added the&s;e domains to his Earldom of Orkney, about 920; and they were held by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors for three or four cen|turies: the inhabitams of the&s;e tracts are mingled Norwegians and Piks; tho the&s;e northern parts, being &s;eparated by Murray Frith from the Low|lands of Scotland, and adjoining to the Celtic part, the Ga&euml;lic tongue has lately gained much ground there. But that any Norwegians, or Danes, ever &s;ettled in the parts &s;outh of Murray Frith, there is not a &s;hadow of authority. The Moravians were Piks, as Fordun tells, lib. II. c. 30. During the early Piki&s;h period of our hi&s;tory, the Danes and Norwegians appear to have regarded Pikland as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by their own peo|ple, and do not &s;eem to have mole&s;ted it. In the Ninth century they began their incur&s;ions; but were con&s;tantly repelled by the Piki&s;h inhabitants, a people as martial as them&s;elves, and who alone, of the &s;urrounding nations, &s;eem to have matched them in arms. They were always regarded as the bittere&s;t enemies, and could never effectuate any &s;ettlement whatever; far le&s;s &s;ettle in &s;uch numbers as to make any alteration on the language of the country.</P>
<P>As tho&s;e who have travelled in Scandinavia think all our Lowlanders, Scandinavians, from identity of &s;peech and manners; &s;o, from a great re&s;emblance in the&s;e matters, tho&s;e who have travelled in Germany think them Germans. But the neare&s;t part of Germany is twice as far from Scot|land, as the &s;outh of Scandinavia; and to think that any German colony arrived in, or after, the Roman period of our hi&s;tory, can be &s;hewn to be &s;ubver&s;ive of all hi&s;toric evidence concerning North Britain. Our language has many German words, as the German and Scandinavian are but dialects of the &s;ame tongue. We have old Ger|man
<PB N="349" REF="438">words not to be found in the Scandinavian; and old Scandinavian not to be found in the Ger|man. But of this pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, to wind up the confutation of the&s;e &s;uperficial opinions, advanced merely becau&s;e their a&s;&s;ertors had not examined the matter, it is not the embroidery, or the &s;owing of the robe, which mu&s;t be attended to; but the cloth of which it is made. The&s;e adventitious &s;ettlements, grant|ing them all for the &s;ake of argument, would, if the body of the people had been Celtic, have been lo&s;t in the number; and would have a&s;&s;umed the Celtic tongue, as the Belgic, Piki&s;h, and Dani&s;h &s;ettlers in Ireland; and as the Engli&s;h them&s;elves, tho a$ numerous and conquering people, would have al&s;o done, had not &s;pecial laws been made again&s;t it. Language depends on the univerfal population of a country; not on &s;cattered &s;ettle|ments of adventitious people. Our poor Scoti&s;h antiqui&s;ts are to this day enemies of the Piks; and would allow them nothing if they could. It is their trade to fight again&s;t all authorities, all truth, and common &s;en&s;e. On this occa&s;ion, being really ignorant of that grande&s;t feature of our hi&s;tory that the Piks were a Gothic people, they have blun|dered in utter darkne&s;s; and had recour&s;e to ab&s;urd ingenuity, in&s;tead of reading every thing that could be redd on the &s;ubject, in order to find facts. One would have imagined that &s;ome one of them might have blundered on the truth: but in fact they have, like Fal&s;taf, a natural alacrity in &s;inking; and, in antiquarian matters, it is an infallible rule that truth can never be di&s;covered by ignorance.</P>
<P>It has been amply &s;hewn that the Piks were a Gothic people; and the inhabitants of all pre&s;ent Scotland and it's iles. The Ga&euml;l, or Celts in Scotland, do not now amount to above one quarter of the people. The Lowlanders of Scotland amount to two thirds of it's inhabitants. Of the
<PB N="350" REF="439" MS="Y">other Third being Highlanders, and people of the Iles, a great part con&s;i&s;ts of Goths, tho now u&s;ing the Celtic tongue. For the Old Scots, who came into Argyle, in 503, were from the north of Ireland; and were mixt with Crutheni, or Piks, inhabitants of the&s;e parts, tho their tongue had been lo&s;t in the &s;urrounding Celtic. In the He|bud Iles, and in Argyle, and the north of Scotland, the Norwegians were lords, for four centuries from the ninth: and they, in like man|ner, lo&s;t their &s;peech among the more numerous Celts. When the&s;e parts returned to the Scoti&s;h crown, the inhabitants remained as before. The chief families in the Highlands are all of Norwe|gian extract. The Celtic <HI>Mac</HI> is nothing: it is the name it&s;elf we mu&s;t judge from. Thus the Mac Leods are &s;o called from Liod Earl of Ork|ney: the Mac Sweyns, Mac Niels, with a &s;core of others, all bear the <HI>Mac,</HI> with a Norwegian name. Even when the &s;econd name is Celtic, it was often taken by a Norwegian to gratify his &s;ubjects, or be&s;towed by a Highland bard; as the Mac Donalds are known to be direct male de&s;cen|dants of Reginald, Earl of Orkney. The&s;e High|land bards, it is well known, will alter a plain Gothic name to a Celtic one, in a twinkling; and are very ready in dirtying people with this honour. A part of the Iles &s;till &s;peaks the Gothic tongue, namely, the whole Orkney and Shetland Iles. The other parts &s;peak Ga&euml;lic; but of them a great part are Goths, tho their &s;peech be lo&s;t in that of the mo&s;t numerous people.</P>

<P>To proceed to a few remarks on the Piki&s;h tongue, let us begin with ob&s;erving, that the Gothic Language divides it&s;elf into Two Grand Branches, namely, The GERMAN, and The SCANDINAVIAN. Of the&s;e the German de&s;erves the &s;uperiority on many accounts:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Scythians mu&s;t have be|gun the population of Germany long before they entered Scandinavia, and they pa&s;&s;ed thro a part of ancient Germany, on the ea&s;t, before they went over to Scandinavia. That part of them, which peopled the va&s;t extent of Germany, had arrived at it's we&s;tern extremity as &s;oon, if not &s;ooner than tho&s;e who peopled only the &s;outhern tract of Scandinavia, had gained it's we&s;tern extremity.</ITEM>

<P>The&s;e two Grand Dialects have always been dif|ferent, as is well &s;hewn by the learned author of
<PB N="353" REF="442" MS="Y">the <HI>Di&s;&s;ertatio de lingua Danica,</HI> to be found at the end of Gunlaug's Saga, <HI>Hafniae,</HI> 1775, 4to. The Scandinavian was in the middle ages termed Dani&s;h; then Nor&s;e, as Norwegian; and laterly Icelandic, becau&s;e now found in the greate&s;t purity in that remote iland. An old writer<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Dudo Ge&s;t. Norm. apud D$ C$e&s;ne.</NOTE> &s;ays that William I. duke of Normandy, when he heard Heriman, a Saxon general, &s;peak Dani&s;h, a&s;ked in admiration, <HI>quis eum Daci&s;cae regionis linguam, Saxonibus inexpertem, docuerit?</HI> 'Who had taught him the Dani&s;h tongue, unu&s;ed by the Saxons?' He who enquires into the origins of the Engli&s;h tongue will find them in Flanders and Germany: but tho&s;e of the Scoti&s;h mu&s;t be traced in Scandi|navia.</P>
<P>In both the&s;e Grand Dialects of the Gothic, nouns and verbs are declined and inflected by changing the terminations, as in the Greek and Latin. The Modern Engli&s;h, and the Modern Scoti&s;h, form the &s;ole exceptions, being changed only by prepo&s;itions and auxiliary verbs. This &s;ingularity of the&s;e tongues pa&s;&s;ed from the French to the Engli&s;h at the Norman conque&s;t; and from the French and Engli&s;h, to the Scoti&s;h.</P>
<P>A curious di&s;tinction between the German dia|lect and the Scandinavian is, that the later has, properly &s;peaking, no letter P in it. Not above twenty words begin with P; and they are all names of foreign places, or real foreign words, as Petland, &s;o called by the inhabitants; Papa, a foreign word, father, applied to a prie&s;t; and the like. And even in the&s;e, P is pronounced V, Vetland, Vava. The Scandinavian has al&s;o no W at all. The Runic alphabet wants E, G, P, Q W, V, X, Z. On the contrary the Gothic of Ulphilas has both P and W; as have al&s;o the Anglo-Belgic, of which &s;o many noble &s;pecimens re|main; and the Tude&s;que. The&s;e tongues have al&s;o E, G, P, Q, W, Z. The later Anglo-Belgic
<PB N="354" REF="443">has X and V. But V in particular, which &s;upplies both P and W in the Scandinavian, is unknown to the Gothic of Ulphilas; Tude&s;que; and olde&s;t Anglo-Belgic. The Scandinavian has al&s;o no C, which is a &s;uperfluous letter in every language having <HI>k</HI> and <HI>s;</HI> and no Q, X, or Z; for <HI>q,</HI> it u&s;es <HI>kv;</HI> for X, <HI>ks;</HI> for <HI>z, &s;d.</HI> The Scandinavian has but one &s;upernumerary letter, &thorn;, TH; the Gothic of Ulphilas has G, or Y, open, thus written in Anglo-Belgic &s;mall letter g, and in our Scoti&s;h &dram;; which being the identic form of Z has made our ignorant printers of old poetry totally confound our language by putting Z in it's place in&s;tead of Y. Ulphilas has al&s;o &psgr;, TH; #, or QU, which begins &s;o many words in old Scoti&s;h; and X, or CH. But the total want of P and W may be looked on as the grand literal di&s;tinction, between the Scandinavian and the German dialects of the Gothic. And this &s;eems a remarkable in&s;tance of the effect of climate upon language; for P and W are the mo&s;t open of the labial letters; and V is the mo&s;t &s;hut. The former requires an open mouth: the later may be pronounced with the mouth almo&s;t clo&s;ed, which rendered it an acceptable &s;ub&s;titute in the cold clime of Scandinavia, where the people delighted, as they &s;till delight, in gutturals and dentals. The climate rendered their organs rigid and contracted; and cold made them keep their mouths as much &s;hut as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Hence al&s;o another grand di&s;tinction between the German and the Scandinavian; namely, the length of the words in the former, and their &s;hortne&s;s in the later dialect. Long words, as a late author very ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, are infallible proofs of an original and ancient tongue. In time by fre|quent u&s;e, and that de&s;ire of &s;aying much with little effort, which is &s;o natural in a cold climate e&s;pecially, words are contracted by degrees. The words of Ulphilas are as long, or longer, than
<PB N="355" REF="444" MS="Y">the German, or Tude&s;que. The Anglo-Belgic words are &s;horter. The Scandinavian &s;horter &s;till.</P>
<P>The Piks, being divided from Scandinavia by a wide &s;ea, and being planted in North Britain, in an early period, when navigation was only un|dertaken for &s;ettlements, or ravages, and not to maintain intercour&s;e, they were of cour&s;e quite detached from their progenitors. At fir&s;t the Cumri were their only neighbours in the iland; but fear keeped them at a di&s;tance; and the Cumri, who only knew them as ravagers, could have little or no intercour&s;e with them. About 412, the Southern Piks were converted to Chri&s;tianity by Cumraig mi&s;&s;ionaries; and it is likely that a few Latin and Cumraig words might now appear among them. About 430, the Piks, bur&s;ting from the mountains to which the Roman power had long confined them, poured over the plains, driving the Cumri to the We&s;tern &s;hores, and peopled the country down to the Humber. The Belgic Britons were now their neighbours; and the Piks, &s;oftened by a fertile country, would &s;oon begin, in their &s;outhern &s;ettlements, to adopt the arts and manners of that more poli&s;hed people. With the&s;e arts and manners, many new words would creep in, from the German dialect of their civilized neighbours. The Cumri, their old neighbours, were a barbarous pa&s;toral people; the Belgae, even in Cae&s;ar's time, an agricultural people; and now poli&s;hed as Roman provincials with every elegance and luxury. The&s;e Piks, who were divided by the Wall of Gallio from their brethren, would, naturally regard them&s;elves as detached from their own kingdom, and as in|habitants of a new. The Belgae being the mo&s;t numerous people, their &s;peech would prevail as &s;uch among the detached Piks; the more e&s;pe|cially as it was but a &s;uperior dialect of their own tongue. When Ida arrived with his Angles, a
<PB N="356" REF="445" MS="Y">century after, the progre&s;s of the Belgic language among the&s;e Piks would of cour&s;e have been great.</P>
<P>When Beda wrote in 731, or about three cen|turies after this &s;outhern &s;ettlement of the Piks, he informs us there were Four tongues &s;poken in Britain, namely, Engli&s;h, Piki&s;h, Briti&s;h or Cumraig, and Scoti&s;h or Iri&s;h. We &s;ee from this, that, as the name of Angli was given by Beda to all the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of South Britain, &s;ave the Welch, this &s;peech which Beda calls Anglic was in fact the Belgic, with a new name. <HI>Nomina non mutant rem.</HI> Beda calls the Jutes of Kent and the &s;outh; Saxons of the middle parts; and real Angli of the north, all Angli promi&s;cuou&s;ly. And it is clear from him, that one &s;peech had now pre|vailed among them all; becau&s;e Jutes, Saxons, Angles, were but as drops in the &s;ea of Belgae, and their language would vani&s;h in le&s;s than a century. That this &s;peech, which Beda calls Anglic, was not Anglic, is known to all. It is improperly called Saxon by the learned; but all grant, and this very name implies, that it was not the Scandinavian dialect of the Gothic, as it mu&s;t have been, had it been Anglic, from Anglen, a Dani&s;h province; but was the German dialect of the Gothic, Saxon by name, but in fact Belgic. Caedmon wrote in it in this century, when Beda lived; and Alfred and others after; &s;o that we can judge of it perfectly. It is German-Gothic; and not Scandinavian-Gothic. The Saxon was in fact German-Gothic, as well as the Belgic. They were the &s;ame tongue; but it is the real propriety of the name that is contended for. A&s;&s;er, who wrote the century after Beda, but lived among the We&s;t Saxons, as Beda among the Angles, calls this Anglic of Beda repeatedly Saxon. We have no writer who lived among the Jutes, el&s;e we &s;hould have it called Jutic. The fact is, all the &s;ettlers &s;poke this language in a century or &s;o after their arrival; and of cour&s;e all gave it their
<PB N="357" REF="446">own name. This Belgic mu&s;t have, long before Beda's time, made great progre&s;s among the Piks of Northumbria, from their detached &s;ituation, from their fewne&s;s when compared with the Belgae, and other cau&s;es above &s;pecified. Le&s;s than three centuries will, in &s;uch &s;ituations, totally change a language; much more alter one dialect of the Gothic into another, as the example of the Nor|mans in France may &s;hew. No wonder then that Beda &s;hould call that &s;peech Anglic, which A&s;&s;er calls Saxon; and &s;hould &s;pecially di&s;tingui&s;h this Anglic, &s;poken all over England in his time, from Northumbria to Cornwall, and Kent, from the Piki&s;h, or old and broad Scandinavian of Pikland. For tho the people of Northumbria, the greate&s;t domain of the Angli, were really Piks; yet from their &s;ituation, &s;eparate government, and other cau&s;es, their &s;peech had a&s;&s;umed the Belgic hue, while the old Piks retained their Scandinavian original &s;peech. From a &s;imilar &s;ituation the German has greatly gained, and is daily gaining, on the Dani&s;h; while the Swedi&s;h remains purer.</P>
<P>The Saxon Chronicle was certainly begun, if not compleated, in Northumbria, for it di&s;tin|gui&s;hes the South Humbrians from <HI>Us,</HI> as it ex|pre&s;&s;es, a term only applicable when a work was written in Northumbria. It &s;eems to have been begun in the Eleventh, and fini&s;hed in the Twelfth century. It's language is Belgic, not Scandina|vian. The York&s;hire dialect of the Engli&s;h is full of Scandinavian words; but in Beda's time, when language was rude, this di&s;tinction would be little &s;triking.</P>
<P>Beda produces one word in the Piki&s;h language, namely, <HI>Peanvahel,</HI> the name of a town at the ea&s;t end of the wall of Antoninus, now, as is thought, Kineil. This name has been &s;aid to be Welch; but mo&s;t fal&s;ely, for neither <HI>Pean</HI> nor <HI>Vahel</HI> are to be found in the Welch language. <HI>Pen</HI> is, in
<PB N="358" REF="447" MS="Y">Welch, the head of a hill, the top of an object<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">So is <HI>Pinne,</HI> or <HI>Penne</HI> in German. The Celtic is quite full of Gothic words.</NOTE>; but no <HI>vahel,</HI> or <HI>fahel,</HI> is to be found in that tongue. The Welch for wall, is <HI>gwal,</HI> a modern word derived from the Latin <HI>vallum,</HI> or from the Gothic <HI>veal,</HI> and our <HI>wall;</HI> as almo&s;t all words in the pretended Celtic are either Gothic, or Latin.

Nen|nius, <HI>cap.</HI> 19. &s;peaking of this, &s;ays the Wall was called in Welch <HI>Gual,</HI> which is the mere Ro|man <HI>vallum,</HI> with the Welch G prefixed; and that the town was, in Welch, called <HI>Pengaaul,</HI> a very different word from <HI>Peanvahel.</HI> The Piki&s;h word is broad Gothic, <HI>Paena,</HI> 'to extend,' Ihre; and <HI>Vahel,</HI> a broad &s;ound of <HI>veal,</HI> the Gothic for 'wall,' or of the Latin <HI>vallum,</HI> contracted <HI>val:</HI> hence it means, 'the extent, or end of the wall,' as the Piks, who followed it to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, would naturally term it; for they could not follow it to the we&s;t, where the Britons of Strat Clyde dwelled. The Engli&s;h name, as Beda &s;ays, was <HI>Penveltun,</HI> which is merely the Piki&s;h, in a &s;ofter dialect with <HI>tun,</HI> or <HI>town,</HI> at the end of it; and it is amazing our Welch dreamers do not prove the Engli&s;h language to be Welch, for the Engli&s;h name is far nearer to the Welch than the Piki&s;h. But to leave this trifling.</P>
<P>The nature and de&s;ign of this work forbids my entering on a formal di&s;&s;ertation concerning the Piki&s;h language; and i &s;hall therefore clo&s;e this &s;ubject with a few brief remarks. The earlie&s;t
<PB N="359" REF="448">remain we have of the Lowland Scoti&s;h, or modern Piki&s;h, is the poem of Barbour, written in 1375. Here is a &s;pecimen, faithfully copied from the MS. in the Advocates' Library, Edin|burgh, dated 1489.</P>

<P>Of this, as of all our old Scoti&s;h language, the GRAM|MAR is perfectly ENGLISH. That is, there are no inflections of verbs and nouns, as in the Ger|man and Scandinavian dialects; but their purpo&s;e is &s;erved by prepo&s;itions and auxiliary verbs. The Grammar of any language is it's mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential and permanent form; and nothing is more certain than that the old Scoti&s;h language derives it's Grammar from the Engli&s;h, as the Engli&s;h does from the French, and the French from the Ita|lian. The origins of the Engli&s;h language have never been enquired into with any degree of labour and minute attention; nor the time marked when the French grammar prevailed over the Belgic, or as it is called Saxon, which had in|flections, as the other Gothic dialects. This Bel|gic, or old Engli&s;h, had certainly &s;ome inflections, down to the Twelfth century, tho many of them had worn out before; for the grammar of a language is very difficult to change, and it took
<PB N="360" REF="449">three centuries at lea&s;t totally to change the Eng|li&s;h, namely, from the Eleventh, when French was fir&s;t &s;poken by the court and nobility before the Conque&s;t, and after by all, &s;ave the common people, till the Fourteenth century, when &s;ome inflections &s;till remain in the work of Robert de Brunne. It mu&s;t, however, be remarked, that the inflections of the later Gothic are few: and that the genius of that language often admitted prepo&s;itions, and auxiliary verbs, from the fir&s;t. But it was infallibly the influence of the French &s;peech, which has no inflections in nouns, that led us to di&s;card them. The French, Italian, and Spani&s;h, have inflections of verbs; and &s;o have we, tho very few. In which we abide by the later Gothic, while they follow the Latin; of which all the&s;e tongues are but corrupt and ru&s;tic dialects.</P>
<P>From the reign of Malcolm III. 1056, to the end of that of Alexander III. 1291, mo&s;t of the Scoti&s;h monarchs were married to Engli&s;h ladies; and a continual intercour&s;e prevailing between the kingdoms, from their natural &s;ituation and con|nection, it is then no wonder that the language of a kingdom, &s;o very &s;uperior to Scotland as Eng|land was, and is in all re&s;pects, &s;hould have been always gaining ground there. The Dani&s;h lan|guage is now very much German, owing to the &s;ame cau&s;es. The Hou&s;e of Oldenburg is a Ger|man hou&s;e; as Malcolm III. from his long re&s;i|dence in England, was almo&s;t an Engli&s;hman, as to manners, &amp;c. The borough towns of Scot|land were, as we have &s;een, tenanted by Engli&s;h|men. All the&s;e cau&s;es, no doubt, contributed to introduce gradually Engli&s;h words and idioms, nay &s;uch &s;mall grammar as the Engli&s;h bears, into the Piki&s;h or Scandinavian dialect of the north of Britain. The Engli&s;h was al&s;o a written tongue, while there is no room to &s;uppo&s;e that the Piki&s;h ever was, being &s;poken in a rude and barbarous kingdom; while the Belgic, or Engli&s;h, had
<PB N="361" REF="500" MS="Y">been long the written language of a great and civi|lized country. When it was above &s;hewn that the Lowland Scots could not receive their language from the Engli&s;h, it was not meant to deny that they received the form of their <HI>written</HI> language from the Engli&s;h. All that was intended to be proved was, that, as the Piks &s;poke a dialect of that very language before, the Engli&s;h improve|ments of that dialect were natural and ea&s;y; whereas, had they &s;poken the Celtic, the Engli&s;h language would have gained no ground. For the cau&s;es above given are &s;ufficient to alter one dia|lect almo&s;t wholly into another; but by no means to introduce a new language.</P>
<P>As we have no work written in Scotland in the common tongue prior to the Eleventh century, when the Belgic, or Engli&s;h, had begun in all appearance to prevail, the Piki&s;h is beyond doubt a lo&s;t language, or rather a lo&s;t dialect of the Scandinavian, as the Spartan is a lo&s;t dialect of the Greek. But one half of the words, &s;till u&s;ed in the remote Lowlands of Scotland, are not Engli&s;h, or Belgic; but Piki&s;h, or Scandinavian. The Piki&s;h never being a written dialect, it mu&s;t be &s;ought for only in the vulgar mouth; and it were well worth the curio&s;ity of &s;ome man of &s;kill to give us a Glo&s;&s;ary of the Uncommon Words u&s;ed from the Forth to Murray Frith. We find in our old Scoti&s;h poets, and in Provincial Poetry of Scot|land, that nearly half the words are Scandinavian, not Engli&s;h. A Scoti&s;hman can learn the Scan|dinavian in very &s;hort time<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">'Accedit linguae cognatio, quae facit ut Scoti in Suediam advenientes Suedice loqui faci$lime di&s;cant.' Loccen. Ant. Sueo Goth. This mu&s;t have been ea&s;ily ob&s;erved in the many Scoti&s;h who advanced the arms of Gu&s;tavus Adolphus. Mr. Coxe, in his Travels, I. 504, ob&s;erves the great &s;imilarity between Swedi&s;h and broad Scoti&s;h; and mentions a Swedi&s;h traveller, who found many ob&s;olete Swedi&s;h words common in Scotland.</NOTE>; while an Engli&s;h|man finds it difficult.

<P>In this it is attempted literally to follow the four former, as far as the language would bear. When the re&s;emblance between all the&s;e four &s;pecimens is &s;o great; the reader will not wonder that there is &s;o much proximity between the old Engli&s;h and Scoti&s;h. The Piki&s;h &s;o differed from the Anglo-Belgic in Beda's time, that he marks them as di&s;tinct languages. The one retained all it's German peculiarities; the other all it's Scandi|navian. But by colli&s;ion, and at an early period, by an interchange of words, they became very &s;imilar. For we mu&s;t not imagine that all the profits were on one &s;ide. The early Engli&s;h min|&s;trels
<PB N="364" REF="453" MS="Y">were all of the north country; and from them many words, not to be found in the Anglo-Belgic, pa&s;&s;ed into the old Engli&s;h. It is indeed a &s;ingularity worth remarking, that the Germans were never &s;o remarkable for poetry as the Scandi|navians. The northern Angli, and Piks, a Scandinavian people, brought poetry into fir&s;t re|pute in England: the Normans, another Scandi|navian people, did the &s;ame in France; for the claim of the in&s;ipid Troubadours has been laid a&s;leep by M. le Grand<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">In the able prefaces to his <HI>Fabliaux ou Contes,</HI> 5 vols. 12mo. a work tran&s;lated from the old northern poets of France, and which has pa&s;t thro many editions, while the works of the Troubadours, tran&s;lated in like manner, have been received with the coldne&s;s their in&s;ipidity merited.</NOTE>. But it is clear to me, as is natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that the form of the language, and the greater number of mutual words, pa&s;&s;ed from England into Scotland.</P>
<P>On the &s;ubject of our Scoti&s;h poetry it is worth ob&s;erving that our ballads and &s;ongs are as &s;imilar to the Dani&s;h as po&s;&s;ible, as the reader will find on looking into the <HI>Priscae Cantilenae Danicae</HI> of Vel|leius, publi&s;hed la&s;t century; or the <HI>Levninger af Middel-Alderens Digtekun&s;t,</HI> Kiobenhavn, 1780, 8vo. None of the&s;e Dani&s;h &s;ongs are older than the Fourteenth century: and in all points they per|fectly re&s;emble our Scoti&s;h ones, tragic and comic. They who enquire into the origins of Scoti&s;h mu&s;ic, &s;hould &s;tudy that of Iceland and Scandi|navia.</P>
<P>Fordun tells, lib. II. c. 9. 'The manners of the Scots are various as their languages; for they u&s;e two tongues, the Scoti&s;h and the Teutonic, which la&s;t is &s;poken by tho&s;e on the &s;ea coa&s;ts, and in the Low Countries: while the Scoti&s;h is the &s;peech of the mountaineers, and remote ilanders<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">'Mores autem Scotorum, &s;ecundum diver&s;itatem lin|guarum, variantur: duabus enim utuntur linguis, Scotica, vi|delicet, et Teutonica; cujus linguae gens maritimas po&s;&s;idet et planas regiones: linguae vero gens Scoticae montanas inhabitat et in&s;ulas ulteriores.'

<PB N="365" REF="454">then de&s;cribes the former as a civilized people: the later as mere &s;avages. Sir John Clerk, per|haps the be&s;t antiquary that Scotland has yet pro|duced, tho he was quite deficient in erudition, has, in a work written in 1742, but not publi&s;hed till 1782<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Bibliotheca Topographica Brit. <HI>Reliquiae Galeanae,</HI> p. 362.</NOTE>, and which did not happen to be &s;een by me till after the materials of this Enquiry were col|lected, attempted to &s;hew that the Piks were Saxons, and of cour&s;e their tongue Saxon. In this he lyes open to ea&s;y and direct confutation: for, to go no further, the Piks and Saxons are by all the ancient writers marked as quite different nations; and we know from Beda that in his time the Piki&s;h, and Anglic, or Saxon, were different tongues. But in other articles of that di&s;&s;ertation, on the Ancient Language of Great-Britain, Sir John is entitled to the highe&s;t prai&s;e, as the ONLY antiquary, who has &s;een that infallible truth, that the Belgic Britons &s;poke that language afterward called Saxon, and that the Celts, even in Britain, were confined to the we&s;tern parts, long before the time of Cae&s;ar. This di&s;covery aro&s;e to me, when collecting materials for the Di&s;&s;ertation at the end of this work; before i began to compile tho&s;e of this work it&s;elf; and two years before i &s;aw Sir John's production; yet Sir John has no doubt the priority of a di&s;covery, which in the hi&s;tory of no other country would have been re&s;erved for this century, and which i will venture to &s;ay is more important to Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, than any yet made, or that can be made. For it not only adds SEVEN CENTURIES to the hi&s;tory of Engli&s;hmen, as &s;uch; but will, if duly attended to, put the whole hi&s;tory of Law, Manners, Antiquities, &amp;c. in England upon
<PB N="366" REF="455">quite a new, and far more intere&s;ting footing. Unhappily Sir John wanted learning &s;ufficient to &s;tamp full authority upon this; and he re&s;ts upon the meaning of a few German words what de|pended on a di&s;play of the whole progre&s;s of the Scythians, or Goths, &s;hewn in the Di&s;&s;ertation an|nexed to this work. His ideas on the &s;ubject are of cour&s;e confu&s;ed and inaccurate; and he only &s;ees, thro a mi&s;t, a va&s;t object, which is capable of receiving the whole blaze of day. Concerning the Piks, he is totally mi&s;taken; and he ought to have redd a thou&s;and or two more books, before he attempted the antiquities of his country. Sir Robert Sibbald, the earlie&s;t antiquary Scotland produced, &s;aw this matter better, the end of la&s;t century; and tells us expre&s;&s;ly, that the Piks were Goths, and that the names of their kings are all Gothic, not Celtic<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. of Fife.</NOTE>. Pity that Sir Robert al&s;o had only that kind of &s;uperficial and ignorant learning, &s;o remarkable in the works of our Scoti&s;h antiqui&s;ts, who ought to read thou&s;ands of books before they pretend to write a word; and that he was &s;o weak, as not to know that the name of a country is nothing, either in regard to it's inhabi|tants, or it's hi&s;tory, But the little word <HI>Scot</HI> totally perverted Sir Robert's under&s;tanding; and made him, who was a Pik, regard his own ance&s;tors as his enemies.</P>
<P>To di&s;play the origins of the old Scoti&s;h lan|guage of the Lowlands; and the words of it which belong to the Anglo-Belgic and to the Scandina|vian, and tho&s;e peculiarly it's own; would require a work as large as the whole of this, or much larger: and is well de&s;erving the attention of &s;ome able hand. But this &s;ubject &s;o little concerns my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, that i &s;hall leave it after &s;ome re|marks on the name the Piks gave them&s;elves in their own language.</P>
<PB N="367" REF="456" MS="Y">
<P>The old Anglo-Belgic writers, who were the neighbours of the Piks, and had frequent inter|cour&s;e with them, certainly called them by that very appellation they gave them&s;elves, and pro|nounced as they pronounced it. King Alfred in his tran&s;lation of Beda, and in that of Oro&s;ius, calls them repeatedly <HI>Peohtas, Peahtas, Pehtas.</HI> The Saxon Chronicle <HI>Pihtas, Pyhtas, Pehtas, Peohtas.</HI> Ethelwerd, lib. II. 12. <HI>Peohtae;</HI> lib. IV. <HI>Pihti.</HI> And many other Saxon remains pre&s;erve the&s;e appellations.</P>
<P>Wittichind, a German Saxon writer, who lived under Otho I. about the year 950, narrates fabu|lou&s;ly that the Britons &s;ent to the Saxons for a&s;|&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the Piks and Scots; and calls the former repeatedly <HI>Pehiti,</HI> which is merely a &s;ofter pronunciation of <HI>Pehti.</HI> Andrew Winton, a Sco|ti&s;h Chronicler, who wrote about 1410, calls them <HI>Peychts, Pechts, Pihts.</HI> The common denomina|tion among the people of Scotland, from the Pehts Wall in Northumberland to the Pehts hou&s;es in Ro&s;s-&s;hire, and up to the Orkneys, is <HI>Pehts.</HI></P>
<P>The genuine name the Piks from the earlie&s;t times gave them&s;elves, and which they bore among neighbouring nations, was therefore that of PEHTS, variou&s;ly pronounced PIHTS, and PEUHTS; for <HI>Pe&ouml;tas,</HI> in the Scandinavian, would now &s;ound <HI>Peuchtas,</HI> the <HI>&ouml;</HI> in Icelandic having the &s;ound of a French <HI>u.</HI></P>
<P>This name being guttural, and &s;omehow inde|finite, and lax in the mouth, it was &s;oftened and rendered firm and di&s;tinct, by different nations in different manners. In their original &s;eats on the Euxine, Greek and Roman writers call them PIKI and PEUKINI; being the real names PIHTS and PEUHTS, mollified, and rendered more di&s;tinct. The later name follows them into Scandinavia, as formerly &s;hewn.</P>
<P>On their emerging again to Roman view in the North of Britain, they were at fir&s;t called
<PB N="368" REF="457"><HI>Caledonians</HI><NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Lloyd in pref. to Archaeolog. &s;ays, the Welch &s;till call Scotland <HI>Kelidhon;</HI> Baxter, in his Glo&s;&s;ary, tells that the Welch call the North Britons <HI>Kelydhon,</HI> and their woods <HI>Coit Kelydhon.</HI></NOTE>, from a Cumraig epithet; but when the Romans by further acquaintance had di&s;covered the real name, the writers of a declining age un|fortunately termed them PICTI; a name, which tho only the real one PIHTS, &s;oftened to Roman pro|nunciation, yet gave ri&s;e to great confu&s;ion. For the word <HI>Picti,</HI> implying <HI>painted people</HI> in Latin; the identity of the words blended matters totally di&s;tinct, and made the real name of a nation pa&s;s for a Latin epithet, &s;o that even their own writers were led a&s;tray; and Claudian, a poet full of quib|ble and conceit, &s;ays <HI>Nec fal&s;o nomine Picti.</HI> The Engli&s;h and Iri&s;h were alike unfortunate in their Latin appellations. <HI>Angli</HI> has been gravely de|rived from <HI>Anguli,</HI> 'corners,' becau&s;e England has many promontories. The <HI>Hiberni,</HI> or Iri&s;h, have been confounded with <HI>hiberni,</HI> 'wintry peo|ple, or people in a wintry climate,' by &s;everal writers; nay by Sir James Ware, who quotes
<Q>Hibernique Getae, pictoque Britannia curru,</Q>
as belonging to Ireland! The <HI>Britons</HI> were in like manner thought to be named from the Latin <HI>Bru|tus,</HI> for ten centuries. Such was Latin etymology: and now we promi&s;e fair to have ten centuries of Celtic; and then ten centuries of Laplandic; for human folly is always the &s;ame. But to return to the <HI>Picti,</HI> the Romans, unhappily not catching from the pronunciation the old name <HI>Peukini,</HI> mu&s;t have been puzzled how to modify this barbaric term: for as <HI>Piki</HI> implied in Latin wood-peckers, &amp;c. a victory over the&s;e <HI>Piki</HI> would have &s;ounded odd in their annals. The Cumraig Britons called them <HI>Phichtiaid,</HI> and the Romans could have only Latinized this name <HI>Ficti,</HI> which was wor&s;e and wor&s;e; for a battle with <HI>Ficti, feigned</HI> people,
<PB N="369" REF="458" MS="Y">people of <HI>fiction,</HI> would have been matter of laughter. From Scandinavian pronunciation, the name was <HI>Vici, towns,</HI> or <HI>Victi, conquered,</HI> or <HI>Vecti, carried,</HI> &s;o that the confu&s;ion was endle&s;s. <HI>Picti,</HI> coming fir&s;t to hand, took the place of all. Ammianus calls the &s;outhern Piks, by the Scandinavian pro|nunciation, <HI>Vecturiones;</HI> that is, <HI>Vect-veriar,</HI> or <HI>Piki&s;h men,</HI> as the Icelandic writers call them in their old Norwegian feats <HI>Vik-veriar.</HI> But the mountain Piks, being then under a different government, and forming a &s;eparate nation from the Southern Piks, the old name of <HI>Ducaledones,</HI> or Northern Caledonians, was &s;till continued to the former, with whom the Cumraig Britons had no neighbourhood, nor intercour&s;e; while the real name of the Southern Piks became perfectly known to them from neighbourhood.</P>
<P>In Scandinavia, even among the Piks them&s;elves, the &s;ound of P vani&s;hed, and it was pronounced as V, from circum&s;tances above explained. Hence the <HI>Vika</HI> and <HI>Vikr</HI> of Icelandic writers, and Nor|wegian charters. The &s;ame names were al&s;o pro|nounced <HI>Vicha</HI> and <HI>Vichr,</HI> even in the Sixteenth century, as Olaus Magnus &s;hews; nay, Torfaeus, in the beginning of this century, u&s;es <HI>Vika</HI> and <HI>Vicha,</HI> indi&s;criminately. This V is in fact only the Scandinavian pronunciation of P, and prevails in the Icelandic to this very day; P being never pronounced but as V in that tongue, even in foreign words, for in Icelandic there is no P at all. Saxo, <HI>lib.</HI> IX. &s;peaks of the conque&s;ts of Regnar Lodbrog, in Scotia, <HI>Petia,</HI> and the He|budes. This mu&s;t have been taken from a poem preceding 1020, for Scotia is here palpably Ire|land, the only Scotia, prior to about 1020, and Petia is Petland, or pre&s;ent Scotland. Saxo a traveller, and a man of great information, knew that the inhabitants, the Engli&s;h and the Germans, called the country <HI>Pehtland,</HI> and he u&s;es the genuine, not the Icelandic pronunciation. For
<PB N="370" REF="459">about the Sixth century, and from that time downward, as above explained, the Anglo-Belgic began to prevail among the Southern Piks in Nor|thumbria, and by degrees proceeded northward, &s;o that in Alfred's time, or about 880, the real &s;ound of the letter P would be re&s;tored among the Southern Piks at lea&s;t: if indeed the Scandinavian V for P be not a late corruption. And neither in the old Scoti&s;h, nor in the pre&s;ent Buchan dialect, is V put for P at all. In Icelandic writers we find <HI>Pets</HI> and <HI>Petlands Fiord,</HI> for Piks and Pentland Frith; while the old Piks of Norway are called Vikir, and their country Vik. This ari&s;es from our having no Scandinavian authors at all, till the Twelfth century; long before which time the Piks of Britain had become perfect foreigners to the Scandinavians, and their origin quite unknown to them. Hence the change of name, for one and the &s;ame people, the old name of Pikir, pronounced Vikir, con|tinuing to the Norwegian Piks; while the Briti&s;h Piks, calling them&s;elves Pehts, the name was &s;oftened to Pets, but really pronounced Vets and Vetland. Thus, tho the Engli&s;h proceeding from Anglen in Denmark, it might be &s;uppo&s;ed their country would be called Angleland in Ice|landic writers, it is uniformly termed England; and neither Saxo, nor any old Icelandic writer, ever hints, or &s;eems to have known, that the Eng|li&s;h were from Anglen. Such pieces of ignorance are frequent in the mo&s;t enlightened times; no wonder then that they &s;hould occur in dark periods.</P>

<HEAD>Divi&s;ion I. Public Manners.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. GOVERNMENT Tacitus, the very fir&s;t wri|ter from whom any hints concerning the manners of the Caledonians, or Piks, can be derived, &s;hews, that in the time of Agricola's expedition, they were divided into &s;everal &s;mall &s;tates, as the Ger|mans, and other ancient nations. As Tacitus rightly con&s;iders the Scandinavians as Germans, and expre&s;&s;ly tells us, that the Caledonians, or Piks, were Germans, it follows that the fine de|&s;cription of the German governments, given by Tacitus, mu&s;t be that of the Piki&s;h &s;tates al&s;o, namely, a democracy, which chu&s;ed it's own chiefs, but re&s;erved all liberty, and the mo&s;t e&s;&s;en|tial part of the power, to the people. Dio accord|ingly tells us expre&s;&s;ly, that the Caledonian &s;tates were democratic. And Tacitus does not mention that they had one king among them, but po&s;i|tively implies that they had none, by calling Gal|gacus only the mo&s;t eminent of their generals<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Inter plures duces virtute et genere prae&s;tans, nomine Galgacus. <HI>Agric.</HI></NOTE>. In Germany and Scandinavia, Tacitus mentions kings: but the Piks being a later &s;ettlement, had not proceeded &s;o far in &s;ociety, &s;ave in their fir&s;t Briti&s;h-&s;eats, the Hebud Iles, where a kingdom had already been formed, which was in time to extend it's power over all the Caledonians. Taci|tus mentions that in Britain there were formerly kings, but that in his time there were only fac|tions. This de&s;cription belongs to the &s;outhern Britons, with whom alone, as procurator of Bel|gium, Tacitus had acquaintance, as is clear from the context, in which the&s;e Britons are compared with the oppo&s;ite Gauls; and from his adding that
<PB N="373" REF="462" MS="Y">the &s;tates formed no confederacies, <HI>ita dum &s;inguli pugnant univer&s;i vincuntur,</HI> '&s;o that fighting apart, all are conquered:' whereas, in the very &s;ame work, the &s;ame writer tells that the &s;tates of Caledonia, with &s;urprizing prudence, joined in a common league again&s;t Agricola.</P>
<P>In the Hebud Iles Solinus, who wrote about 240, de&s;cribes the &s;ingular &s;tate of the early Piki&s;h mo|narchy, above in&s;erted. From Adomnan we learn that the Piki&s;h kings had a &s;enate<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rex cum &s;enatu valde pertime&s;cens, domum egre&s;&s;us, obviam cum veneratione beato pergit viro. <HI>Adom.

He al&s;o mantions the 'familiares regis,' II. 13. the <HI>comites</HI> of the Germans, in Cae&s;ar and Tacitus.</NOTE>, as among the Germans: and from the Regi&s;ter of St. An|drew's, that there was a <HI>Regalis Pro&s;apia,</HI> or Royal Race: from whom it has been above &s;hewn that the kings were cho&s;en.</P>
<P N="2">II. RELIGION. Of the religion of the Caledo|nians there is no hint in any Roman writer, as the country was little known, or de&s;cribed. Adomnan is the earlie&s;t author, from whom any information on this &s;ubject can be drawn, and that information very &s;mall. It appears from him that the Piks re|verenced fountains<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">In Pictorum Provincia . . . audiens in plebe gentili de aliquo fonte divulgari famam, quem qua&s;i divinum &s;tolidi homines . . . venerabantur. II. 6.</NOTE>, and a&s;cribed great virtues to them, a notion common to the ancient Goths. That they had <HI>&s;ui Dei,</HI> 'their own gods,' whom they thought &s;tronger than him of the Chri&s;tians. That they had <HI>Magi,</HI> or Magicians, prie&s;ts who were thought to po&s;&s;e&s;s the power of rai&s;ing &s;torms: many adventures of Columba, with <HI>Broi|chanus,</HI> one of the&s;e Piki&s;h magicians, are nar|rated by Adomnan.</P>
<P N="3">III. WAR. On this head almo&s;t the whole Ro|man information nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ts. From Tacitus
<PB N="374" REF="463" MS="Y">we learn that the Caledonians, or Piks, u&s;ed cars in battle, as the Belgae and other Gothic nations. That the Celts ever had cars there is no proof. Adomnan de&s;cribes Echuvi&s;laid, king of the Crutheni, or Piks in Ireland, as u&s;ing a car<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Sed et de rege Cruithniorum, qui Echuvi&s;laid vocitabatur, quemadmodum victus currui in&s;idens eva&s;erit prophetizavit &s;imiliter &s;anctus. <HI>MS.</HI> in Bibl.

He does not &s;pecify the arms peculiar to each cla&s;s; but only mentions that the Caledonian &s;words were very large, and without points, &s;o as to cut, but not thru&s;t; and their &s;hields were &s;mall<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">In Roman coins, Britannia has a &s;mall round &s;hield, and long &s;pear.</NOTE>; matters in which they exactly corre&s;pond with the Germans, as de&s;cribed by the &s;ame author. The Caledonians al&s;o u&s;ed archery, as all barbaric na|tions, and as Tacitus &s;pecially &s;hews. The arrows were pointed with flints, now often found, and called elf-&s;tones. In the time of Severus, Dio &s;ays, the Caledonians al&s;o u&s;ed daggers, as the Saxons, and many other Goths. Herodian mentions their &s;mall &s;hields; and adds lances to their armour. The la&s;t are al&s;o mentioned by Dio, who &s;ays their lances had an hollow ball of bra&s;s at the handle-end, which &s;erved as a kind of rattle<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Lib. 76. Herodotus de&s;cribes bands of Per&s;ians, with gold and &s;ilver pomgranates, on their javelins, lib. VII.</NOTE>. Gildas mentions that the Piks had a
<PB N="375" REF="464">kind of hooked &s;pears, with which they drew the Britons down from the battlements of the wall of Gallio. Such &s;pears were u&s;ed among the Scan|dinavians; and Bartholin gives us a print of one found in Iceland. Sidonius Apollinaris de&s;cribing the Gothic princes &s;ays, <HI>muniebantur lanceis un|catis.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. NAVIGATION. The Piks were perpetually pa&s;&s;ing the friths of Forth and Clyde to mole&s;t the Britons. Their boats were u&s;ually of o&s;iers, in|terwoven, and covered with the &s;kins of bea&s;ts, as appears from Solinus, Gildas, and Nennius. Si|donius Apollinaris, <HI>car.</HI> 7. mentions &s;uch boats as u&s;ed by the Saxons<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Quin et Aremoricus piratam Saxona tractus</L>

Such were al&s;o the boats of the old Welch and Iri&s;h. Tacitus de&s;cribes navigation as at a great height among the Suiones, or Danes of his time. But the ca&s;e was different in Caledonia, an earlier and more barbaric &s;ettlement of the Goths. The Piks, however, would naturally advance in this &s;cience, tho i cannot find that they ever had fleets, like their Scandinavian ance&s;tors. In the year 1726, under &s;everal &s;trata of earths and fo&s;&s;ils, was found in the bank of the Carron, a large boat, 36 feet long, and 4&frac12; broad; made of one entire piece of oak, and well poli&s;hed, both within and without. From the number of &s;trata, Sir John Clerk thought it an antediluvian boat; but, that je&s;t apart, the&s;e &s;trata certainly &s;hew it very old; and it is mo&s;t probable that it was Piki&s;h, becau&s;e found in the country of the Piks.</P>
<P N="5">V. POETRY and MUSIC. With regard to the&s;e the ancients have hardly left one hint. Tacitus mentions the war-&s;ong, and military &s;houts of

</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="2" TYPE="division">
<HEAD>Divi&s;ion II. Private Manners.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. BIRTH, MARRIAGE, DEATH. The whole accounts of private manners of the Piks are mo&s;t defective. Dio tells us the Caledonians had their wives in common, and brought up their children in public. Cae&s;ar tells us the &s;ame thing of the &s;outhern Britons, that ten or twelve had wives in common; and chiefly brothers with brothers, and parents with children; but that the children be|longed to him who fir&s;t wedded the mother. The&s;e are mo&s;t &s;ingular and &s;triking features of barbaric &s;ociety, hitherto rather ra&s;hly denied, than illu&s;trated by &s;imilar examples. The Ger|mans, as Tacitus &s;hews, had quite the contrary practice; all being content with one wife, &s;ave the rich, who had &s;everal. They were palpably in a more advanced &s;tate of &s;ociety, than either Piks, or Belgae of Britain, their brethren. Monte&s;quieu ob&s;erves it as a feature of pa&s;toral &s;ociety, that men then have many wives, or wives in common, altogether as bea&s;ts; but he gives no examples. Herodotus tells us, expre&s;&s;ly, that the Agathyr&s;i, a Scythic nation in Germany, had their wives in common in his time. Tacitus &s;ays the Germans, <HI>alone of all barbaric</HI> nations, had not wives in com|mon; a clear proof that the Celts and Sarmatians bad their wives in common: and he tells us of the Peukini; that, thro the promi&s;cuous marriages of their chiefs, they were di&s;graced by a re&s;emblance of the Sarmatae. The Belgae and Piks &s;eem to have been in one identic &s;tate of &s;ociety, as might be expected from common Gothic origin, from in&s;ular &s;ituation, and from both &s;ettling about one and the &s;ame period. Not &s;o barbarous as to have all wives in common, they &s;eem not however to have
<PB N="377" REF="466" MS="Y">been &s;o civilized as the Germans. The cu&s;tom, however, &s;eems to have been peculiar to the great, as among the Peukini in Germany; and Solinus de|&s;cribes it in his time as a privilege only of the Piki&s;h king, to chu&s;e and di&s;mi&s;s any woman he plea&s;ed. This was the natural progre&s;s of the cu&s;tom, for the great would certainly be the la&s;t to abandon &s;uch licence. There is indeed every rea|&s;on to believe that Cae&s;ar judged only from the chiefs in Britain, as too many travellers apply the vices of the great to whole nations. But of this cu&s;tom we have &s;poken before. Concerning the re&s;t of this article we know next to nothing. From Adom|nan it appears that the Piks did not, in Columba's time, burn their common dead, but buried them<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">In Pictorum provincia . . . alios ex accolis a&s;picit mi|fellum humantes homunculum, II. 12.</NOTE>. People of rank may however have been burnt. Among the other Goths it appears to me that burning the dead was never very frequent, but always confined to the chief ranks, being laborious and expen&s;ive<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">So Tacitus expre&s;&s;ly, 'Funerum nulla ambitio: id &s;olum ob&s;ervatur ut corpora CLARORUM virorum certis lignis crementur.' <HI>Germ.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P N="2">II. EATING AND DRINKING. Of the&s;e we have almo&s;t as little direct information. Dio tells us that the Caledonians u&s;ed a certain root which &s;upported them long, without their &s;uffering hun|ger; and the &s;ame is told of the Scythians<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Dio lib. 76. And &s;ee Pliny, Hi&s;t Nat. XXV. 8, for the u&s;e of the herbs <HI>&s;cytice</HI> and <HI>hippace,</HI> among the Scythae.</NOTE>. Soli|nus &s;ays that the Piks of the Hebudes lived on fi&s;h and milk; but hunting &s;eems to have afforded a chief food of the Piks of Caledonia. In the old forts, bones of deer have been often dug up. From Adomnan we learn that the Piks u&s;ed gla&s;&s;es for drinking, as he de&s;cribes Broichan the Magi|cian u&s;ing one. Ale, the drink of all the Goths, was certainly that of the Piks.</P>
<PB N="378" REF="467" MS="Y">
<P N="3">III. HOUSES AND DRESS. From Tacitus it is clear that the Caledonian hou&s;es, of whatever materials formed, had combu&s;tible roofs; for he de&s;cribes them as all &s;moking around, being &s;et on fire by the Caledonians in their retreat. The walls were probably of turf, or wood. Adomnan de|&s;cribes that of the Piki&s;h king, Brudi, to have been a <HI>munitio,</HI> or ca&s;tle<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Alio in tempore, hoc e&s;t in prima Sancti fatigatione itine|ris ad regem B$udeum, ca&s;u contigit ut idem Rex fa&s;tu elatus regio, &s;uae munitionis, &s;uperbe agens, in primo beati adventu vni$non aperiret portas. II. I4.</NOTE> But it was &s;urely of wood; and no ruins of &s;uch edifices can remain at the pre&s;ent time. The Caledonians, like the Germans, were al|mo&s;t naked. Roman writers &s;ometimes mention them as naked; and if we &s;aw a &s;avage, with only a deer's &s;kin thrown over his &s;houlders, and the re&s;t of his body bare, we would, like the&s;e writers, call him naked. For it appears from Cae&s;ar that the Belgae, and from Tacitus that the Germans, wore a &s;kin of &s;ome bea&s;t. No doubt the Romans &s;aw the Piks in their mo&s;t naked &s;tate, for they only vi&s;ited them in the &s;ummer, the &s;ea&s;on of war. And the chiefs, as in Germany, apparently wore a tunic and breeches, under their mantle. Gildas, c. 15, mentions the Piks as partly cloathed, or at lea&s;t girt with a cloth about the middle. This was in the Fi&s;th century. In the Sixth, when Columba lived, Adomnan drops no hint of dre&s;s or nakedne&s;s: but it is inferable that they were cloathed. The cu&s;torn the ancient Piks had of &s;taining their bodies has been formerly &s;hewn to be peculiar to the Gothic nations. The Belgae al&s;o retained the &s;ame cu&s;tom, till the Romans intro|duced luxury and dre&s;s among them. But the Piks of Northumbria had it's remains down to the eighth century, as appears from a decree of the Council of Calcot, in 787, above adduced. This &s;taining was done like the <HI>tattooing</HI> of American
<PB N="379" REF="468" MS="Y">&s;avages, by pricking the &s;kin with a thorn, or other &s;harp &s;ub&s;tance, and then rubbing in the juice of a plant<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>&mdash; viridem di&s;tinguit glarea mu&s;cum,</L>
<L>Nota Caledoniis talis pictura Britannis.</L>
<BIBL><HI>Au&s;on. in Mo&s;ella.</HI></BIBL></Q></NOTE>. From Cae&s;ar we learn that the plant u&s;ed among the Belgae was the <HI>vitrum,</HI> or woad; which made them of a blue colour. Pliny tells that this plant was, in Gaul, called <HI>gla&s;tum,</HI> and that the Briti&s;h matrons in particular u&s;ed it. Cae&s;ar's <HI>vitrum</HI> is palpably a tran&s;lation of this Gallic word <HI>gla&s;tum,</HI> or gla&s;s; and the word mu&s;t have originated with the Belgae, being Gothic, and given to amber by the German Goths, as we learn from the &s;ame Pliny. This tattooing as a terrible ornament, the Piks did, like the Ameri|cans, in various figures. So Claudian;</P>
<Q><L>Venit et extremis legio praetenta Britannis,</L>
<L>Quae Scoto dat froena truci, ferroque notatas</L>
<L>Perlegit exanimes Picto moriente figuras.</L>
<BIBL><HI>De Bello Getico.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P>Be&s;ides this tattooing, the &s;avages of North Ame|rica often paint their faces red, or &s;ome other colour. This they vary as occa&s;ion demands; one colour denoting mourning, another joy, &amp;c. But whether this cu&s;tom was known to the Piks, or not, cannot be now determined. The &s;avages of North America, tho the cold be certainly, at lea&s;t, equal to any ever felt anciently in North Britain, go mo&s;tly quite naked; tho &s;ome wrap a &s;kin about theta in winter, as the Piks no doubt al&s;o u&s;ed. Herodotus tells us of the Neuri, a Scythic nation, who were in winter turned into wolves: Pelloutier ingeniou&s;ly explains this, that in winter they cloathed them&s;elves in the &s;kins of wolves.</P>
<P N="4">IV. OCCUPATIONS. The chief occupation of a &s;avage is to procure food and dre&s;s: the chief oc|cupation of civilized &s;ociety is the &s;ame, to procure money to buy food and luxuries. As Solinus tells that the Hebudian Piks lived on fi&s;h and milk,
<PB N="380" REF="469">fi&s;hing and pa&s;turage mu&s;t have been their main occupations. The other Piks added hunting: and in time agriculture.</P>
<P N="5">V. ARTS AND SCIENCES. The hou&s;es of the Piks were certainly only built with wood, or wattles, and mud; as among the Gauls, and the Germans. But from the ancient writers who men|tion the Piks, we can only learn that they could make weapons of war; which were certainly of bra&s;s, as were tho&s;e of all other early nations; and war chariots, in which bra&s;s was no doubt u&s;ed in tho&s;e parts now made of iron. Of the Sciences of the Piks we find no ve&s;tige: and while in South Britain one or two learned men aro&s;e, we have every rea&s;on to believe that the Piks did not even know the u&s;e of letters, and that their churchmen, and men of letters, were all Iri&s;h and Welch, down to the Twelfth century. This proceeded from the &s;upreme contempt, which the barbaric Goths, as a wi&s;e people; had for that jumble of madne&s;s, and &s;anctity, called learning in the dark ages.</P>
<P N="6">VI. AMUSEMENTS. Of the&s;e, as might be ex|pected, we find no account in tho&s;e ancient authors, who mention the Piks.</P>

<HEAD>Divi&s;ion I. Public Manners.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. GOVERNMENT. It is now univer&s;ally known that the government of the early Goths, was generally a Democratic Monarchy. Herodotus de&s;cribes the early Scythians as having kings: and
<PB N="381" REF="470">from Tacitus we learn, that the Germans had them. But the&s;e kings were merely as Indian chiefs; men, who from &s;uperior merit had ac|quired influence, and which influence remained to their de&s;cendents and relations, from a natural veneration of the people for the &s;uperiority which had e&s;tabli&s;hed it, and a hope of finding it con|tinued in the &s;ame progeny. The example of Iceland may &s;atisfy us, that the barbaric Goths were not incapable even of a regular republic, e&s;tabli&s;hed upon wi&s;e laws. But in this republic riches had &s;uch natural influence, that if a man be|came very rich, the laws, pa&s;&s;ed in the General A&s;|&s;embly, in which even all the pea&s;ants appeared, were not held ratified, if &s;uck a man were ab&s;ent. Some man of this de&s;cription, adding great talents, art, and courage to his wealth, would have in time come to be king. For in &s;uch &s;ociety riches and power are the &s;ame; and nobility always originates in wealth. But how does wealth ori|ginate in &s;uch &s;ociety? Certainly by chance. For a man of the greate&s;t talents, or courage, may make many inroads and expeditions without &s;uc|ce&s;s; while another, by one lucky hit, may ac|quire va&s;t riches: and a man without capacity may find a trea&s;ure, or be &s;ole heir of many re|lations. This Republic of Iceland highly merits the attention of the learned, as we have all it's Laws, Con&s;titution, and Hi&s;tory, in far higher perfection than tho&s;e of Greece and Rome. It pre|&s;ents a picture of the progre&s;s of barbaric &s;ociety, prior to the year 1000, when it became Chri&s;tian, and letters were introduced. A progre&s;s of nine centuries, uninfluenced by foreign manners, had taken place between the &s;tate of the Germans, given by Tacitus, and that of Iceland. But it mu&s;t be remembered that Tacitus tells, the Suiones, or Danes, had wealth; and were from &s;ituation more advanced in &s;ociety than the Germans, even in his time. They obeyed a king with greater, and a
<PB N="382" REF="471">more fixt power: but there is no room to think the royalty was hereditary, el&s;e Tacitus would not have omitted &s;o &s;trange a peculiarity, while all the Germans elected their monarchs, as he tells, from the nobility of their race. From a perfect &s;imilarity of &s;ituation the Piki&s;h monarchy ori|ginated in the Hebud Iles; while Caledonia was divided into democratic &s;tates. Cae&s;ar in&s;tructs us, that the Gallic &s;tates were mo&s;tly democratic; and that the few kings were chiefly u&s;urpers. Tacitus mentions no pure democracies in Germany; and the Gauls were, from Grecian and Roman inter|cour&s;e, more advanced in &s;ociety than the Ger|mans. Like the Greeks they had pa&s;t from petty kingdoms, known at the &s;iege of Troy, to re|publics; while the Germans were &s;till in their heroic age. The Piks, during the Roman period of our hi&s;tory, as may be inferred from their re|mote &s;ituation, re&s;embling that of the Germans, had al&s;o the German government. Tacitus men|tions no kings in Caledonia. Dio, a &s;u&s;picious authority, names one Argentocoxus, and tells a pretty tale about him. It is indeed mere matter of curio&s;ity to enquire whether the Caledonian &s;tates had their petty kings, or not. Such kings were mere chiefs, or fir&s;t magi&s;trates; and with no power over the people, &s;ave what the people plea&s;ed to allow. It has been agitated, whether monarchy, or democracy, be the mo&s;t ancient form of government; but the fact is, that the mo&s;t ancient monarchies were really democracies. We are certain from Tacitus and Dio, that the Cale|donian &s;tates were democratic; and if writers would candidly examine the &s;ubject, they would &s;ee that in early &s;ociety monarchy it&s;elf is always demo|cratic. In the Hebud iles alone, as among their fellow ilanders, the Suiones, a remarkable and real monarchy was e&s;tabli&s;hed, which in time &s;pred over Caledonia. The coincidence of both the&s;e monarchies being in a clu&s;ter of iles is
<PB N="383" REF="472">curious. <HI>Divide et impera</HI> was here done by nature.</P>
<P N="2">II. RELIGION. The religion of the ancient Goths has been lately explained by &s;o many wri|ters, that i need not enter &s;o va&s;t a field. Suffice it to ob&s;erve, that the mythology of a barbaric people mu&s;t be full of confu&s;ion, while even that of the Greeks and Romans is &s;o. Odin is at pre|&s;ent the God be&s;t known to us, as he is mo&s;t celebrated by the Scandinavian &s;calds: but Tui&s;co was in the time of Tacitus the chief god of the Germans; and Irmen&s;ul was in the days of Char|lemagne, he of the Saxons. In the Scandinavian mythology, the chief confu&s;ion ri&s;es from this, that Thor, beyond doubt the Jupiter, or chief god, is &s;ometimes called father of Odin, &s;ometimes &s;on of Odin. The Eddas of Saemund, and of Snorro, al&s;o palpably imply two Odins; and the Scandina|vian antiquaries a&s;&s;ert an elder, and a later. If i may humbly offer an opinion, after &s;o many men of real and profound learning, a &s;imilarity of names &s;eems in traditional times &s;o liable to errors of this &s;ort, to have confounded <HI>Odin,</HI> the god of war with <HI>Godin,</HI> a name for the Supreme Being; whence our word God, and originating from <HI>god,</HI> GOOD. For it is clear from the Eddas, that the Scandinavians, as many of the Greeks and Romans, admitted a Grand Creator and Pre&s;erver, to whom the&s;e gods were but as &s;ervants. When they became Chri&s;|tians, they naturally retained this name for that Great Being. This theory might be &s;upported by arguments very valid, but this is not the place. And i &s;hall clo&s;e this argument, with only admo|ni&s;hing the reader to beware of that grand error of the Scandinavian antiquaries, &s;o unerring in other matters, namely their &s;uppo&s;ing Odin and his A&s;ae to be real per&s;ons, who led their people from A&s;ia, 70 years before Chri&s;t; whereas they belong wholly to Mythology, and not in the lea&s;t to hi&s;tory. Snorro Sturla&s;on, a writer of the <HI>Thirteenth</HI> cen|tury,
<PB N="384" REF="473">is the grand &s;ource of this delu&s;ion; by mentioning in his Edda<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Apud Torf. Ser. Reg Dan. In his hi&s;tory Snorro dates Odin in the time of the Roman emperors.</NOTE> that Odin fled from Pompey; and the veneration paid to Snorro main|tains this puerile fable, tho it be a mere romantic fiction, &s;imilar to that of Scota, daughter of Pharaoh, the Briti&s;h Brutus, &amp;c. Snorro could only find this tale in a Saga, written by &s;ome ig|norant romancer, who had heard of Pompey the Great, and &s;o brought him in as he would have done Alexander the Great, Judas Maccabaeus, King Arthur, or Charlemagne. For where el&s;e could Snorro find this, &s;ave by <HI>&s;pecial revelation?</HI> It is &s;hewn in the Di&s;&s;ertation annexed, that the pro|gre&s;s of the Scythians, or Goths, into Scandinavia, was compleated, at lea&s;t 500 years before Chri&s;t. Nor did they even come out of it again, &s;ave into Britain, Denmark, Ru&s;&s;ia, Iceland, and Normandy. And it is demon&s;trable from all the ancient writers, from Herodotus, down to Cae&s;ar, Tacitus, and Ptolemy, that this pretended expedition of Odin is a mere fable, founded on the allegory that Odin, the God of War, led the Goths into Scandinavia, that is, they opened their path by the &s;word.</P>
<P N="3">III. WAR. The peculiar warlike &s;pirit of the Caledonians, or Piks, unknown to the other Bri|tons, marks them as Goths, and as Scandinavian Goths, the mo&s;t warlike of men. Northern cli|mates produce iron men. The mountains of Scandinavia, and of Scotland, were the natural &s;oil of &s;uch a race.</P>
<Q><L>An iron race the mountain-cliffs maintain,</L>

<PB N="385" REF="474" MS="Y">
<P>This admirable de&s;cription applies &s;o well to the Piks in particular, that one would imagine it drawn from their invincible &s;pirit, and con&s;tant incur&s;ions into the &s;outhern plains. If our High|landers be in fact, as &s;ome a&s;&s;ert, more warlike than their Iri&s;h ance&s;tors, their mountainous &s;itua|tion mu&s;t be one chief cau&s;e, as the great mixture of Goths among them is another. But had the Romans found Celts in Caledonia, they would have totally vanqui&s;hed them at once, with a &s;ingle legion, as they did Celtic Gaul; and, as Tacitus &s;ays, they could have done Ireland. The conque&s;t of the Celts, &s;outh of Forth and Clyde, was &s;o ea&s;y that Tacitus gives no hint of it, but pa&s;&s;es it as a thing of cour&s;e: and in another place &s;ays, that Agricola di&s;covered the Celtic tribes in Galloway, and went and planted ca&s;tles among them. But when the Caledonians appear in Roman hi&s;tory, it is to open a new &s;cene; and to give a &s;ample of &s;uch people as were to over|turn the Roman empire, a &s;pecimen of the O&s;tro-Goths, and We&s;tro-Goths on the Euxine, and of the Northern Germans. Would that, for the &s;ake of civilization, the Piks had been &s;ubdued! Yet their defiance, for three hundred years, to all the power of Rome, is certainly a &s;triking &s;pectacle in hi&s;tory. That their country was not &s;ubject to Rome, is no compliment to it; but that the Romans &s;o repeatedly attempted the conque&s;t, and not only failed, but were forced to build many ramparts and walls in their own defence, gives us a &s;urprizing idea of the warlike &s;pirit of the&s;e northern Goths, to whom, as their &s;outhern bre|thren &s;aid, 'the gods them&s;elves were not equal<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Cae&s;ar, IV. 7.&mdash;The weapons and battles of the Gothic nations, are perfectly known. Their en&s;igns were at fir&s;t heads of boars, wolves, bulls, and other bea&s;ts. But Arrian, <HI>in Tactic.</HI> de&s;cribes the Scythic en&s;igns of his time as dragons made of cloth, and hi&s;&s;ing in the wind. The Scoti&s;h banner, 1138, was a dragon.

Why paint the martial terrors, thundering around a people who compared the delights of a conflict to tho&s;e of love, and who died laughing?</P>
<P N="4">IV. NAVIGATION. As we meet with no di&s;tant maritime expeditions of the Piks, it is needle&s;s to enlarge on this head. It has already been &s;hewn that the Scandinavian ance&s;tors and brethren of the Piks were &s;o &s;kilful in navigation, as to have regular fleets in the time of Tacitus.</P>
<P N="5">V. POETRY AND MUSIC. The Gothic Poetry forms one of the mo&s;t &s;ingular features in the hi&s;|tory of human manners. It's familiar and con&s;tant u&s;e is &s;o remote from modern ideas, nay from the practice of any barbaric nation, ancient or modern, that it &s;eems to us almo&s;t incredible. Yet nothing is more certain than that to be taught the compo|&s;ition of ver&s;e, and the u&s;e of arms, formed the whole Gothic education. Ver&s;e was in &s;uch fami|liar u&s;e among the Goths, that it was common to acco&s;t a &s;tranger in ver&s;e, who at once an&s;wered in the &s;ame<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Sagas, and Northern Writers, <HI>pa&s;&s;im.</HI></NOTE>. The Scalds were only men more di&s;tingui&s;hed for this talent; and who, from &s;u|periority in it, were led e&s;pecially to practi&s;e it. But, even to under&s;tand their ver&s;es, it was requi|&s;ite to have &s;tudied poetry much; for their meta|phors are &s;o violent and remote, and the con&s;truc|tion &s;o entirely changed, that a poem was required to be committed to memory, and often revolved, before it could be thoroly under&s;tood<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Gunl$ng's Saga.</NOTE>. As a
<PB N="387" REF="476" MS="Y">&s;pecimen of the figures, gold is called the dragon's bed, the tears of Freya; poetry, the pre&s;ent, or the drink, of Odin; a combat, the bath of blood; the hail of Odin, the &s;hock of bucklers; the &s;ea, the field of pirates; a &s;hip, the hor&s;e of the waves, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Hardly any idea was expre&s;t in &s;imple and direct terms. Hence the ob&s;curity is prodigious: and to explain one ode of the Edda of Saemund, Eric Hall&s;en, an I&s;landic poet of la&s;t century, employed ten years, and was forced, after all, to give it up in, de&s;pair<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Edda Saemundi, Hafniae 1787, 4to Tom. 1.</NOTE>. This, to be &s;ure, is an unique in&s;tance, as that ode is the mo&s;t ob|&s;cure remain of northern antiquity. Nor does this darkne&s;s ari&s;e from the metaphors only, but from the con&s;truction, which is &s;o perverted, that the mo&s;t perverted part of a Greek or Roman poet &s;eems plain Engli&s;h to it.</P>
<P>Hence it required &s;uperior under&s;tanding and &s;kill to develope this poetry. But it may naturally be concluded, that the more ancient the Gothic poetry is, it will be the more &s;imple. The Death Song of Regnar Logbrog, who was king of Denmark, about 820, is an ancient remain of Scandina|vian poetry; and, tho not &s;o perplexed as many later pieces, it has neverthele&s;s very remote figures, as a battle is called the ocean of wounds. In &s;hort, &s;implicity &s;eems to have been &s;hunned as a matter of ea&s;e: and the more art, labour, and &s;uch &s;caldic &s;cience as then prevailed, that were employed, &s;o much higher was the prai&s;e. Thus we &s;ee that even barbaric &s;ociety is capable of fal&s;e ta&s;te, and fal&s;e refinement, in poetry. The Goths were too ingenious; and &s;acrificed the de|licious poetry of the heart to that refined art, and remote &s;en&s;e, which only employ the head; and employ the head in vain, for nothing can be more fooli&s;h, than for a man to u&s;e much time and labour to wrap a thought in ob&s;curity, only in or|der
<PB N="388" REF="477">that another may u&s;e much time and labour to develope it; while the former, by &s;peaking plain at once, might have &s;aved the whole toil, and have attained far &s;uperior prai&s;e. This un|happy ta&s;te for aenigmas pervades much of the Gothic poetry, and only &s;erves now to excite our wonder at &s;eeing extreme ingenuity, and fal&s;e re|finement, in barbaric &s;ociety. In other bar|baric poetry, perfect &s;implicity is &s;ure to be found; but in the Gothic the ca&s;e totally dif|fers; and the very &s;tudy of the ancient Scan|dinavian poetry, is to this day a peculiar and real &s;cience by it&s;elf; requiring as much, nay more, &s;kill in it's mythology; kinds of ver&s;e, which amount to at lea&s;t three times the number ever known to the Greeks, or Romans; metaphors, phra&s;eology, &amp;c. than is nece&s;&s;ary to the perfect knowlege of the Greek and Roman poetry. A phaenomenon altogether a&s;toni&s;hing; and which &s;ets all theory of human manners at defiance! The Celtic poetry is quite different; having no mytho|logy at all, and only &s;uch few metaphors and per|ver&s;ions, as are found in all rude poetry, as in the Laplandic and Indian Heroic and Amatory Ballads.</P>
<P>The Gothic poems were all &s;hort, as common &s;en&s;e dictates mu&s;t be the ca&s;e in all traditional poetry. The &s;tory of Homer's poetry being pre|&s;erved by tradition, for three centuries, is quite fabulous; for he wrote about four hundred years after letters were u&s;ed, both in Greece and A&s;ia. The Death Song of Regnar Lodbrog is among the longe&s;t pieces of Gothic poetry &s;uppo&s;ed to be tradition|ally pre&s;erved; and it extends to but Twenty-nine octave &s;tanzes, of &s;hort lines. O&s;&s;ian, and <HI>Epic poems,</HI> pre&s;erved by tradition, are ideas which could not have occurred but to a Celtic under&s;tanding. The longe&s;t kind of poem, known to the Goths, was that called the
<PB N="389" REF="478"><HI>Drapa</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">See an account of the Drapa, in Gunlaug's Saga, p. 1, 15, 113. Of the Floker, ib. 113.</NOTE>, which to relieve the memory had al|ways a burden: and it was a very long Drapa, which had Thirty octave &s;tanzas, of the&s;e very &s;hort lines, &s;o u&s;ual, and &s;o di&s;agreable in Gothic poetry, con&s;i&s;ting of but three, four or five &s;ylla|bles each. A piece of this &s;ort, would not of cour&s;e contain more words than &s;ixty, or eighty lines of Homer. The <HI>Flocker</HI> was a &s;horter kind, without burden. The <HI>Mals, Lioths,</HI> and <HI>Quidas,</HI> of the Edda of Saemund, the earlie&s;t repo&s;itory of Scandinavian poetry, being collected about the year 1110, never exceed fifty &s;hort &s;tanzas, of very &s;hort lines: and it is &s;u&s;pected by &s;ome Scan|dinavian antiquaries, that a few of them are of his own compo&s;ure. Rime is unknown to the early Northern poetry; and &s;eems never to have been u&s;ed till after the Scandinavians were Chri&s;tians, in the Eleventh century, and began to imitate the riming Latin ver&s;es of the monks, the real inven|tors of rime.</P>
<P>The Celtic poetry, as that of a weak and de|&s;pirited people might be expected to be, is almo&s;t wholly melancholic in a &s;upreme degree. All the mock O&s;&s;ian is full of deaths, mi&s;ery, and mad|ne&s;s. The Gothic poetry is the exact rever&s;e of this, being replete with that warm alacrity of mind, chearful courage, and quick wi&s;dom, which attend &s;uperior talents. Death, which is &s;uch a whining and dreadful affair in Celtic poetry, is in the Gothic a matter of laughter. It was a cu&s;tom of the Gothic warriors, to &s;ing their own death &s;ong. So did Regnar Lodbrog; &s;o did al&s;o king Bodvar; and many others, noted in northern &s;tory. We have a mo&s;t remarkable corre&s;ponding in&s;tance in Procopius, who wrote about the year 560. He attended Beli&s;arius in his expedition again&s;t Gilimer, king of the Vandals, in Africa, 533; and tells us,
<PB N="390" REF="479" MS="Y">that Gilimer being defeated, and blocked up in the mountain Pappua, he compo&s;ed a &s;ong on his own misfortunes, which he &s;ung to the harp. Soon after he was forced to yield him&s;elf; and Procopius informs us, that he laughed much, when he came before Beli&s;arius, for that pur|po&s;e: tho the &s;tep was to him wor&s;e than death, had he not apparently hoped that he might thereby intercede for his people.</P>
<P>The Piki&s;h poetry, no doubt, con&s;i&s;ted, like that of the other Goths, altogether in ballads, or &s;ongs upon the &s;ubjects of mythology, hi&s;tory, genealogy, moral advices, panegyrics of heroes, and love. In particular Heroic Ballads, and Love Ballads, are the earlie&s;t poetry of all nations. The Lap|landers celebrate old chiefs, as well as their mi&s;|tre&s;&s;es; but we have no &s;pecimen of the former, tho the Spectator has made the later well known. Even in the confined circle of the Ferroe Iles, the Gothic inhabitants have their &s;ongs on celebrated champions<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Debes's account of the Ferroe I&s;les, p. 273. Torfaeus de rebus ge&s;tis Ferraeen&s;ium, <HI>pa&s;&s;im.</HI></NOTE>. And that this cu&s;tom was mo&s;t an|cient among the German Goths appears from Taci|tus, who tells us of the great Arminius, <HI>caniturque adhuc apud barbaras gentes,</HI> 'he is yet &s;ung by the barbarous nations.' Eginhart tells us, that Charle|magne 'wrote, and committed to memory the barbarous and mo&s;t ancient &s;ongs, in which the acts and wars of former kings were celebrated.' A&s;&s;er tells us the &s;ame of Alfred. Jornandes &s;ays, the funeral of Theodoric, the Gothic king, was <HI>cantibus honoratum,</HI> 'honoured with &s;ongs.' Of hi&s;toric and genealogic &s;ongs i have treated above. Of moral &s;ongs we have fine examples in the <HI>Haavamal,</HI> and other pieces of Saemund's Edda. Love ditties form another &s;pecies of early poetry, known, like the Heroic, to all barbaric nations. Some of the old Scandinavian, i am informed, are
<PB N="391" REF="480">exqui&s;itely tender; and tho few have been pub|li&s;hed, yet good examples appear in the Sagas. Take the&s;e tran&s;lations of two &s;tanzas<NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot">From Gunlaug's Saga.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>'Virgin of the beautiful face, learn my ver&s;es. If you remember them, they will deceive your languid hours, when your lover is di&s;tant; and the youth of your heart will appear in your me|mory.'</P>
<P>'We &s;tood together upon the green gra&s;s, when the dam&s;el, with beauteous locks, and &s;weet coun|tenance, embracing me with her arms, weeped bitterly; and, with linnen whiter than &s;now, wiped the thick-falling tears from her radiant eyes.'</P>
<P>The Scandinavians had al&s;o ludicrous and &s;atyric poetry; of which good &s;pecimens may be found in the Edda of Saemund, as the <HI>Aegis-drecka,</HI> or Fea&s;t of Aeger at which Lok appears, and tells all the gods and godde&s;&s;es pre&s;ent their faults; and other pieces &s;imilar.</P>
<P>Of Gothic or Scandinavian Mu&s;ic we know little. In battle the horn was chiefly u&s;ed, as in Scotland, down to the Fourteenth century. The harp was a Gothic in&s;trument, fir&s;t invented in A&s;ia, and pa&s;&s;ing with the Goths to the extremities of Europe, and into the Celtic countries. The an|cient Iri&s;h harp was &s;mall, like the Gothic. The bag-pipe, &s;o fooli&s;hly thought a peculiar old Highland in&s;trument, was u&s;ed by the Greeks and Romans, as we know from many marbles, coins, &amp;c. and Roman authors. From Procopius we learn, that in the &s;ixth century it was the in&s;tru|ment of war among the Roman infantry, as the trumpet was among the hor&s;e<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Lib. II, c. 22, he de&s;cribes the bagpipe as <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, 'made of leather, and thin wood.' Nero u&s;ed to perform on the bagpipe, and there is a coin of his with that in&s;trument on the rever&s;e: See Sueton. in Nerone, c. 14. and Vo&s;&s;ii Lexicon Etym. in voce <HI>Utricularius;</HI> where he ob&s;erves that Varro calls it Pythaula; and above all Blanchini de tribus generibus mu&s;icae veterum organicae, Romae, 1742, 4to. The bagpipe is &s;till familiar among the Greek and Italian &s;hepherds. In Scotland and Ireland it &s;eems quite modern, for Giraldus Cambren&s;is, tho &s;o full on the mu&s;ic of the&s;e countries, does not mention it. See his <HI>Top. Hib.</HI></NOTE>. Hence there is

<HEAD>Divi&s;ion II. Private Manners.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. BIRTH, MARRIAGE, DEATH. Among the Goths, children were dipped in a &s;tream, or lake, &s;oon after the birth; and a name was given them. This was con&s;idered as an holy office, for all waters were held &s;acred. Expo&s;ition of children was cruelly allowed, as among the early Greeks and Romans. If the father de&s;ired that the child &s;hould be pre&s;erved, he took it in his arms, or put it on his knee. Expo&s;ition, tho always very rare, continued lawful in Scandinavia till 1024<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">See a long and curious memoir <HI>De expo&s;itione infantum</HI> at the end of Gunlaug's Saga.</NOTE>. Men of eminent &s;cience often educated children gratis, from infancy to manhood.</P>
<P>In marriage i cannot di&s;cover a &s;hadow of any &s;acred ceremony among the Goths<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Judge Black&s;tone ob&s;erves in his Commentaries, Vol. I. that marriage was totally a civil contract, till Pope Inno|cent III. about the year 1210, ordained it's celebration in the church.</NOTE>. The bride|groom pre&s;ented a pre&s;ent to the dam&s;el's father, or guardian; which has been &s;trangely inter|preted by &s;uperficial theori&s;ts, as if he bought his bride. It was a mere token of re&s;pect, u&s;ual on this occa&s;ion among the Greeks and Romans; and Tacitus tells us, that the German Goths gave and
<PB N="393" REF="482" MS="Y">took pre&s;ents-upon many occa&s;ions. Women were held in &s;uch adoration among the Goths, that to have bought a wife would have ruined the riche&s;t of them. The bride al&s;o gave a pre&s;ent to the hu&s;band. The parties and friends being met, the father &s;olemnly delivered the bride to the bride|groom, with a form of words. After which the marriage fea&s;t, the chief part of the ceremony, followed.</P>
<P>Bodies of common people, and of enemies, were buried; tho&s;e of chiefs burnt, if opportu|nity &s;erved; if not, they were buried. When burnt, the a&s;hes were put in earthen urns, as among the Greeks and Romans; and a barrow of earth, in proportion to the rank, was thrown up. That of a beloved king was &s;ometimes like a little hill.</P>
<P N="2">II. EATING AND DRINKING. Pork was a favourite food of the Scandinavians; and boars' fle&s;h the main article of Odin's Fea&s;t. In Iceland, when fir&s;t planted, herds of &s;wine, and of &s;heep, are often mentioned<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">I&s;lands Landnama. The Chri&s;tianity of the dark ages induced an horror for &s;wine's fle&s;h, as the go&s;pel repre&s;ents the devils entering into the &s;wine.</NOTE>. Hor&s;e fle&s;h was u&s;ed in Scandinavia and Iceland till the eleventh century, when it was forbid by the Chri&s;tian mi&s;&s;ionaries. A curious relict of the old Scythian manners de|&s;cribed by Herodotus! The chief drink of the Goths was ale. Wine and meed were occa&s;ionally u&s;ed. They drank out of horns, as the ancient Thracians and other Scythians. I have &s;een a Scandinavian drinking-horn, carved, painted, and adorned with &s;ilver; with a whi&s;tle made of bone at the &s;mall end, in order to call &s;ervants. Cae&s;ar de&s;cribes &s;uch horns as u&s;ed by the Germans.</P>
<P N="3">III. HOUSES AND DRESS. The hou&s;es of the common people in all the countries of Europe, were at fir&s;t wooden; and continued &s;o till within the&s;e two centuries. Among the Goths, the hou&s;es
<PB N="394" REF="483">of the kings, and great men, were al&s;o of wood: con&s;i&s;ting of many apartments on a floor, &s;ur|rounded with a wooden pali&s;ade, forming within a <HI>curtis,</HI> or court. The womens' apartment was &s;eparate from the re&s;t, and often fortified with another ditch, and pali&s;ade, to prevent their being carried off in the&s;e barbarous times<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See Cleffel. Ant. Germ. and the Northern Antiquaries, for an account of the <HI>&s;kemmur,</HI> or womens' apartments.</NOTE>. The eating room, or hall, was the chief part of the hou&s;e. At an entertainment, the gue&s;ts &s;at on large benches, on either &s;ide the hall, and in the mid&s;t of each bench was an high chair, or &s;eat of honour, for the chief per&s;ons, with one oppo&s;ite for the next in rank<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Curious prints and de&s;criptions of old I&s;landic hou&s;es may be found in Gunlaug's Saga.</NOTE>. The floor was &s;prinkled with &s;traw, a cu&s;tom continued in the Royal Palaces in Eng|land, till the Sixteenth century. The fire was in the middle of the hall; and all along it's wall were boxed beds, yet much u&s;ed in Scoti&s;h villages. The gue&s;ts &s;at ju&s;t before their beds, &s;o as they could &s;tep into them with ea&s;e. A va&s;t ve&s;&s;el of ale was placed on the floor, whence to fill the horns.</P>
<P>The Dre&s;s of the early Goths, con&s;i&s;ted only in a &s;kin thrown over the &s;houlders. But the chiefs even then wore a clo&s;e jacket and trou&s;ers. The la&s;t habit in time became common to the people. In the column of Trajan, the Daci are &s;o repre|&s;ented; and &s;uch was the early Icelandic habit. Breeches were the peculiar habit of the Goths, and unknown to the Celts, from the beginning to this day. Gallia Braceata, or Breeched Gaul, was in|fallibly inhabited by Gothic-German Gauls, as it's po&s;ition might al&s;o &s;hew. The mantle was al&s;o a part of dre&s;s among the chiefs. The ancient German women wore only a clo&s;e &s;hift of linnen, often &s;triped with purple. It had no &s;leeves; and a part of the neck was left bare. In the Icelandic poetry, <HI>clothed in linnen</HI> is a frequent epithet for
<PB N="395" REF="484">the women. But in the earlie&s;t times the linnen &s;hift was a dre&s;s of rank; and the other women roamed naked, like dryades, among the German woods, glittering in the natural &s;plendor of a &s;now-white &s;kin, ro&s;y cheeks, and a prodigious length of golden hair. For the hair of the Gothic women was often &s;o plenteous, as when they combed it to cover them all around, and reach the ground as they &s;at. In winter, a &s;kin of &s;ome bea&s;t was thrown over their &s;houlders, and fa&s;tened before with a thorn, or other rude pin. As the &s;kin was of no u&s;e without &s;uch pin, the antiqui&s;ts may hence derive the nece&s;&s;ity and origin of pin-money. In time the women al&s;o adorned them&s;elves with gla&s;s beads, which they procured from foreign merchants, as the Indians do now. Such beads of mo&s;t colours are found in urns in Germany; with hair-pins, and hair-rings, to fa&s;ten on the ringlets with the pins, as an ornament. Such ar|ticles di&s;tingui&s;h a woman's urn; as bra&s;s razors do a man's: for we learn from the ancients, that the German men &s;haved their beards, and only wore mu&s;tachios.</P>
<P N="4">IV. OCCUPATIONS. It is well known that the early Gothic occupations were hunting, &s;i&s;hing, and pa&s;turage: and in time agriculture. From Tacitus it appears, that the German Goths had orchards. But war was the grand occupation of the Goths.</P>
<P N="5">V. ARTS AND SCIENCES. Herodotus, and other ancients, pronounce the Scythians the wi&s;e&s;t of mankind: and wi&s;dom is the parent of true art and &s;cience. They had philo&s;ophers, and were &s;killed in a&s;tronomy. Tacitus de&s;cribes the German hou&s;es as built of rude materials, without mortar or tyles. He mentions not the materials; but another an|cient<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Herodian VII. 5.</NOTE> tells us, they were of wood. But Tacitus adds, that &s;ome of them were done over with an
<PB N="396" REF="485">earth, &s;o pure and &s;plendid, that it re&s;embled painting. This cu&s;tom continued a long time; and the earth u&s;ed was called <HI>rothe erde,</HI> red earth, and <HI>Engli&s;che erde,</HI> becau&s;e they brought it from Britain<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Cleffel. Ant. Germ. p. 168.</NOTE>. The only genuine &s;pecimens of the earlie&s;t Gothic architecture, are the Piks hou&s;es, &s;ingular exertions of barbaric art. The old Scan|dinavians were remarkable for carving, with a knife, little figures of wood, or bone, and &s;uch have been found in Scotland; particularly a little image of a king, on a throne, dug up near Dun|&s;ta&s;nage, and probably a Norwegian work, done when the&s;e people were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Hebud Iles, and part of the we&s;tern coa&s;t. On the Gothic arts and &s;ciences, much might be &s;aid; but it is the greatne&s;s of the &s;ubject, which forces me not to enter on it here.</P>
<P N="6">VI. AMUSEMENTS. Che&s;s was the favourite amu&s;ement of the Gothic nations, and known among them in the earlie&s;t times, and in all their mo&s;t barbaric po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. Tacitus de&s;cribes the Germans as pa&s;&s;ionately addicted to gaming. In Iceland, che&s;s was general; and in the eleventh century we find Gunlaug the &s;cald playing at che&s;s with the beautiful Helga, who&s;e love &s;o excited him and Rafen, another &s;cald, that they fought, and fell by mutual wounds<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">See that beautiful Northern love tale, Gunlaug's Saga.</NOTE>. Conver&s;a|tion was another chief amu&s;ement; and was em|ployed principally in narrating the acts of great men, in propo&s;ing and &s;olving aenigmas, and in trials of poetic &s;kill. But news were a perfect fea&s;t of the rude Goths. In Iceland, when a foreign &s;hip arrived, it was a privilege of the chief men to hear the earlie&s;t news; and the vulgar were not allowed to approach till they were &s;atiated. Their coun&s;els were often guided by &s;uch intelligence as chance &s;upplied. An exact picture of the Gothic Gauls,
<PB N="397" REF="486">as de&s;cribed by Cae&s;ar. The polite Athenians were al&s;o remarkable for this love of news. But i have already exceeded the bounds propo&s;ed in the &s;ketch of early Gothic manners, whereby to illu&s;trate tho&s;e of the Piks, and mu&s;t begin another chapter.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER XII.</HI> Piki&s;h antiquities in Scotland.</HEAD>
<P>IT is much to be lamented that accuracy and penetration are &s;o rare in works written upon antiquarian &s;ubjects. In every country, if the mo&s;t fooli&s;h books were to be named, it is believed that the antiquarian cla&s;s would be immediately con|de&s;cended on. One would imagine that, in &s;uch &s;ubjects, quite a different mode of rea&s;oning is allowed, than is employed in treating any other branch of &s;cience. In&s;tead of facts, we find mere imagination: in&s;tead of argument, only ground|le&s;s conjecture, &s;upported by &s;uch incoherent and inconclu&s;ive &s;ophi&s;try, as mu&s;t argue a deranged under&s;tanding, if exerted on any other literary de|partment.</P>
<P>Perhaps it may be &s;aid, that the very &s;ubject of antiquities can only admit of opinion, and con|jecture; and never of real &s;cience: that we want grounds for certain knowlege: that of cour&s;e the mind, having no fixt barriers, roams at plea&s;ure in the wilds of cenjecture, without any path to conduct it to the temple of truth.</P>
<P>But it mu&s;t be an&s;wered that the &s;tudy of anti|quities &s;tands exactly on the &s;ame ground with that of hi&s;tory. It is impo&s;&s;ible indeed to write the an|tient hi&s;tory of a country, without being an anti|quary. Nay an hi&s;torian mu&s;t be an antiquary, if he ventures on the hi&s;tory of any country, two centuries before his own time; el&s;e he will err mo&s;t grievou&s;ly, in narrating facts, founded on cu&s;toms, and language, different from tho&s;e of his own
<PB N="399" REF="488" MS="Y">times. The &s;tudy of hi&s;tory is thus &s;o intimately connected with that of antiquities, that it becomes almo&s;t the &s;ame. But e&s;pecially no man can treat of the antiquities of a country, without knowlege of it's hi&s;tory. The origin of any law, or cu&s;tom, the occa&s;ion and nature of any monument of anti|quity; can never be di&s;played, without knowing what nations held the country, and what events happened in it. The foundations of antiquarian &s;cience, therefor, re&s;t &s;olely on the ground of hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Now in hi&s;tory, it is believed, none can deny that there are fixt principles, whereby to di&s;tin|gui&s;h truth from fal&s;ehood, and opinion from &s;cience. In ancient hi&s;tory, the accounts of ancient authors form the &s;ole ground; and leave no room for opinion or conjecture. We mu&s;t abide by their te&s;timonies; and, when they differ among them|&s;elves, abide by the mo&s;t ancient, or be&s;t informed.</P>
<P>But ancient monuments generally e&s;cape the notice of ancient hi&s;tories; and we learn nothing from Herodotus, or Cte&s;ias, that can particularly illu&s;trate the ruins of Per&s;epolis. We only know in general that they mu&s;t be remains, either of the A&s;&s;yrian empire, a part of which exi&s;ted in the Babylonic, after the Median held the north of pre|&s;ent Per&s;ia, or of the Per&s;ian. And as Per&s;ian coins and gems pre&s;ent us with the &s;ame dre&s;&s;es, and &s;ymbols, as are found on the&s;e ruins, it mu&s;t follow that they belong to the Per&s;ian empire, which began &s;o late as 570 years before Chri&s;t..</P>
<P>To apply this example to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, it is certain from ancient authors, and from pre|&s;ent evidence, that the Celts fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Britain and Ireland, till the Scythians, or Goths, came in and vanqui&s;hed them. No trace of any other na|tions than the Celts, and the Goths, can be found in the&s;e ilands, either from the te&s;timony of ancient writers, or from that infallible evidence, the language. The civilized Romans, and their mo|numents, are here out of the que&s;tion; as their re|mains
<PB N="400" REF="489" MS="Y">are perfectly marked, and known. The only que&s;tion, therefor, among antiquaries, is, whether to impute our barbaric monuments to the Celts, or to the Goths?</P>
<P>It is well known that Stonehenge, as it is one of the fine&s;t barbaric monuments in the world, has afforded the greate&s;t room for antiquarian conte&s;ta|tion. Inigo Jones, when he wrote a work to &s;hew it Roman, only gave a lamentable proof of that truth, too much experienced in all countries, that antiquities, like law, medicine, moral philo&s;ophy, natural philo&s;ophy, form a peculiar and di&s;tinct branch of &s;cience, only attainable by laborious &s;tudy, and experience in the &s;ubject; and that he who ventures on them, without any claim to the character of an antiquary, mu&s;t err beyond all ex|ce&s;s, however great his talents may be in other re|&s;pects. Indeed, it may &s;afely be &s;aid that good an|tiquaries are &s;till more rare than even good hi&s;to|rians: and any great library will afford convincing proofs of the a&s;&s;ertion. Dr. Charleton, who im|puted Stonehenge to the Danes, becau&s;e many monuments of that kind are found in Denmark, came very near the mark; but reflected not that the Danes were &s;o late a people in England, that it's erection could hardly e&s;cape hi&s;toric notice. Such monuments are al&s;o common in Germany, &s;o that it might as plau&s;ibly have been given to the Saxons. At la&s;t, the Celts and Druids becoming fa&s;hionable in this century, Dr. Stukeley a&s;&s;igned Stonehenge to the Druids.</P>
<P>From this in&s;tance, and innumerable others, it is perfectly known, that the only debate, con|cerning the rude monuments in Britain and Ireland, is, whether they are Celtic, or Gothic. There being indeed no end of conjecture, &s;ome French writers have lately dreamed of a primitive people, as they call them, to whom &s;uch monuments belong. It &s;uffices to &s;ay, that there is not a trace to be found of this primitive people, but in imagination, all hi&s;tory being quite mute: and
<PB N="401" REF="490" MS="Y">it is a certain rule, <HI>de non apparentibus, et non exi&s;tentibus, eadem e&s;t ratio.</HI> Not to mention that tho&s;e writers, &s;o &s;killed in the ideal part of anti|quities, always &s;hew gro&s;s ignorance of the real. Their rea&s;oning is al&s;o truly antiquarian, and in|con&s;i&s;tent. From a &s;imilarity of barbaric monu|ments, from Japan to Britain, they rea&s;on that they are all remains of one people: totally forget|ting the &s;imilarity of mental, and manual, powers thro the whole extent of human nature. Nay the very &s;imilarity they find is chiefly imaginary; and no greater than between an Engli&s;h &s;teeple, and a Chine&s;e pagoda. A writer<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">M. Bailly Lettres a M.

Did M. Bailly believe the Egyptian &s;tory, that the &s;un had ri&s;en in the we&s;t, and reverted twice to the ea&s;t, in the memory of their annals? Which was the we&s;t, and which the ea&s;t, when the Atlantic affair happened?</NOTE> of his deplorably proves, has lately &s;tarted an idea of a people now lo&s;t; to whom all nations are indebted for their arts and &s;ciences. This people he places in Tartary, becau&s;e he found that the olde&s;t a&s;tronomical ob&s;ervations indicated their being made in that clime. Following M. de Buffon's &s;y&s;tem, that the earth is a piece of the &s;un, &s;truck off by a comet; and mu&s;t have cooled fir&s;t, and been fir&s;t inhabited at the poles; he concludes this people to have come from the north pole, down to Tartary. In Britain, immediately irra|diated with the light of Newton, M. de Buffon's &s;y&s;tem has appeared, and will ever appear, a fan|ciful <HI>reverie,</HI> unworthy of confutation, as it has no grounds whatever, either to rea&s;on on, or be rea&s;oned again&s;t. M. Bailly's argument from old a&s;tronomical ob&s;ervations is curious; but may be an&s;wered, by granting the opinion of many an|cient
<PB N="402" REF="491">and modern philo&s;ophers, that this globe has &s;uffered a change in it's po&s;ition. A comet may change the po&s;ture of the earth, far more ea&s;ily than it could da&s;h off all our planetary &s;y&s;tem from the &s;un. If you grant one conjecture, why not grant another to confute it? But perhaps it is too much to allow M. Bailly's idea of the ancient a&s;tronomical ob&s;ervations &s;olid, for the greate&s;t a&s;tronomers have u&s;ed the&s;e ob&s;ervations before, without any &s;uch di&s;covery. And it may be that the&s;e ob&s;ervations are forged by the Greek authors, who pre&s;erve them; Greece being in the &s;ame climate with Tartary, tho not with Babylon and Arabia, generally reputed the very parent countries of a&s;tronomy, till M. Bailly controverted their claim. As to M. Bailly's argument, that the north of A&s;ia was once a warm climate, becau&s;e elephants bones are found there; he mu&s;t allow his conjec|ture to be an&s;wered by another, that there was a breed of elephants in remote ages, peculiar to a cold, as the pre&s;ent is to a warm climate; ju&s;t as Arabia, a hot climate, produces a pecu|liar and beautiful breed of a&s;&s;es<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Niebuhr De&s;cript, d' Arabie.</NOTE>. Of conjec|tures there is no end; and he who deals in them, mu&s;t expect to be confuted by them. His idea, that the riches found in Tartaric tombs belong to this primitive people in Tartary, only &s;hews his total ignorance of antiquities; for it is perfectly known, that they are, for the mo&s;t part, Per&s;ian &s;poils, won by Genghis Chan, and Timur, in their expeditions, as appears from their fabric: and that the fragments, really Tartaric, are of no older date than the fir&s;t of the&s;e conquerors, who fir&s;t brought wealth into Tartary. In &s;hort, his idea of a primitive people in Siberia and Tartary, from whom the arts &s;prung, is not only oppo&s;ite to all ancient hi&s;tory, but is confutable from the cer|tain fact, that no ruins, coins, nor reliques of any kind, u&s;ed by a civilized people, can be found in
<PB N="403" REF="492">the&s;e countries, but what are of very late date: and it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that this civilized people, from whom arts and &s;ciences &s;prung, would be &s;trangers to tho&s;e arts which mark the re&s;idence of civilized nations. But of this too much.</P>
<P>For my part, who never venture further than hi&s;tory will carry me, i have nothing to do with the primitive world, nor with any primitive na|tion; but &s;hall leave literary Quixotes to conquer &s;uch ilands on dry land for their Sanchos. From ancient Greek and Roman writers, it is per|fectly known that the we&s;t of Europe was anciently inhabited by two grand races of men, the Scythians and the Celts: the later being indigenes, the for|mer an A&s;iatic people. When Cae&s;ar entered Bri|tain, and fir&s;t di&s;clo&s;ed it to hi&s;toric authority, he found the indigenes, or Celts, confined to the in|terior, or di&s;tant parts of the iland; while the Belgae, a German progeny, as he informs us, had all the maritime parts. The Celts were, as he &s;ays, &s;trangers to agriculture, and lived by hunt|ing and their &s;locks; while the Belgae were an agri|cultural people. Britain again remained unvi&s;ited by the Romans for a century longer, when Claudius began the conque&s;t<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">See the authorities produced, Part II. c. 1.</NOTE>. During that century, the Belgae had been always gaining ground, as civi|lized colonies do among &s;avages. In Ptolemy's time, it is clear that the Belgae had all the &s;outh and ea&s;t of pre&s;ent England. In the north the Piks were a Gothic people, as the Belgae in the &s;outh: but the Piks had expelled a Celtic peo|ple from the north, as the Belgae had from the &s;outh.</P>
<P>Thus hi&s;tory &s;o far illu&s;trates the barbaric mo|numents in Britain, as to make it certain, that they mu&s;t be either Celtic or Gothic. The fir&s;t and grand enquiry therefor, among antiquaries, ought to have been, whether they are Celtic or
<PB N="404" REF="493" MS="Y">Gothic; or which are Celtic, and which Gothic? But mo&s;t unhappily they have taken them all for Cel|tic, while the truth is quite on the other &s;ide. It is indeed the peculiar defect of antiquaries to take, as &s;ure foundations, tho&s;e very points which are entirely fal&s;e and delu&s;ory. Thus Pelloutier, Mal|let, and others, regard the Celts and Goths as all one people: and, without u&s;ing a &s;ingle authority or argument upon the &s;ubject, a&s;&s;ume, as granted, a gro&s;s error; building va&s;t edifices upon a mora&s;s, without once examining the foundation, tho that foundation ought to have been their principal care. In like manner none of our antiquaries has ever ex|amined, if our barbaric remains be really Celtic, or Gothic: but they have taken it for granted that they are Celtic, nay, that they are Druidic, as they facetiou&s;ly call them, without ever u&s;ing a &s;ingle argument or authority on the &s;ubject. This error is indeed chiefly owing to their gro&s;s ignorance of the ancient hi&s;tory of their country, which leads them to regard the whole inhabitants of Britain and Ireland as Celts, till the Saxons en|tered England: whereas all Britain and Ireland were conquered, and in a great mea&s;ure po&s;&s;e&s;t, by the Goths, two centuries before the birth of Chri&s;t, as &s;hewn, or to be &s;hewn, in the&s;e volumes. In|deed the French antiquaries, tho infinitely &s;upe|rior to ours in all other re&s;pects, have to this hour &s;hewn little knowlege of the conque&s;t of Gaul, and population of one third of it, by the Belgae, a Gothic people; but whom they regard as being them&s;elves Celts. In all &s;cience error has fir&s;t appeared, by the natural propen&s;ity of the human mind to fal&s;ehood; but not without bene|ficial effects, for truth is never firm, till erected upon the ruins of error. Malebranche preceded Locke; and De&s;cartes, Newton. May hi&s;tory keep pace with other &s;ciences in England; and be erected upon the ruins of foreign error!</P>
<PB N="405" REF="494" MS="Y">
<P>Another radical cau&s;e of this error is, that an|tiquaries regard the Druids, and their rites, as univer&s;al among the we&s;tern nations in Germany, Scandinavia, Gaul, Britain, Ireland. Here they again take for granted a foundation, not only to be proved, but impo&s;&s;ible to be proved, and ut|terly fal&s;e. Cae&s;ar tells us expre&s;&s;ly of the Ger|mans, <HI>neque Druides habent,</HI> <Q>they have no &startq;&endq;Druids:</Q> Tacitus, in his long and valuable ac|count of Germany, &s;ays not one word of Druids: nor is there <HI>one</HI> authority in all antiquity for Druids being at all known, except in Gaul and Britain. Even in the&s;e two countries they were only known among the Celts of the we&s;t. For Cae&s;ar tells us, the Belgae of Gaul were Germans of quite different &s;peech, laws, and manners, from the Celts; and, as Germans, it follows from his expre&s;s te&s;timony, that they had no Druids. The Belgae of Britain are exactly in the &s;ame predicament. When the Romans attacked Angle&s;ey, they found Druids; but there is not one authority for their exi&s;tence among the Bri|ti&s;h Belgae, nay direct authorities, as above &s;een, again&s;t it. The Caledonians Tacitus calls Ger|mans; and Beda, with other proofs above given, evince them Scandinavians; and it is of cour&s;e impo&s;&s;ible that they could have Druids. In Ire|land there is not a &s;hadow of an authority for the very name of Druid being known; and antiqua|ries might, with equal rea&s;on, give us Bonzes and Dervi&s;es in Ireland. Cae&s;ar tells us, that Druidi&s;m was invented in Britain, and pa&s;&s;ed to Gaul; and there is rea&s;on to conclude, that it was originally taught by the Phoenicians to the people of Cornwall, where they traded for tin, as it's deities and mythology are clearly Phoenician. The god Belinus, or Baal, the my&s;tic egg, &amp;c. are mere tran&s;cripts of Phoenician theology; and, if we had much light on the Druidic &s;y&s;tem, there
<PB N="406" REF="495" MS="Y">is room to infer that the re&s;emblance would be complete; but all we have from the ancients con|cerning the Druids would not fill a page. As to the dreams of French and Briti&s;h antiqui&s;ts on the &s;ubject, they are only fit for laughter; and <HI>Druidic</HI> is beginning to be a term for the mo&s;t non&s;en&s;ical nonentity of antiqui&s;m. The cu&s;toms of all nations and languages are huddled together, to make out a ma&s;s of Druidi&s;m; while there is no authority at all for Druids being known be|yond pre&s;ent North Wales on the north, and the river Garonne, the bound of the Celtae in Gaul on the &s;outh. A line drawn by the Severn in Britain, and Seine in Gaul, forms the ea&s;tern bound, while the ocean forms the we&s;tern. Pliny tells us, that Tiberius aboli&s;hed the Druidic reli|gion, which he could not have done, had it &s;pred &s;o wide as we dream. But in Nero's time there were Druids found in Mona, or Angle&s;ey, by Suetonius Paullinus; which would &s;eem to have been their la&s;t refuge: and Paullinus de&s;troyed their groves<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Prae&s;idium po&s;thac impo&s;itum victis, exci&s;ique luci &s;aevis &s;uper&s;titionibus &s;acri; nam cruore captivo adolere aras, et hominum fibris con&s;ulere deos, fas habebant.

<P>That our old barbaric monuments are Celtic or Druidic, not one authority or argument has been u&s;ed to prove. That they are not Celtic, but Gothic, may be &s;hewn from the following autho|rities and arguments.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. They are found all over Germany and Scan|dinavia, nay in Iceland<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Worm. Mon. Dan. Key&s;ler, Coxe's Travels, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE>, where it is certain no Celts nor Druids exi&s;ted. As it is perfectly known that the Gothic inhabitants of Britain came from Germany and Scandinavia, while no Celts nor Druids ever went there, the inference is direct and obvious.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Celts, from all ancient accounts, and from pre&s;ent knowlege, were, and are, a &s;avage race, incapable of labour, or even rude arts. They were indigenes of Europe; as are the Fins; and no &s;tone monuments can be traced among the Fins. The Goths, on the contrary, were only a barbaric race, with barbaric arts from the begin|ning; and originated from A&s;ia, where the rude, as well as the cultivated, arts fir&s;t began.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The mo&s;t remarkable barbaric monuments in Europe are tho&s;e circles of erect &s;tones, which antiqui&s;ts of this century call Druid temples. No|thing can be more certain from all the ancients, who mention the Druids, than that they had no temples, but wor&s;hipped in groves. Had the&s;e been Druid temples, the Romans, when they abo|li&s;hed Druidi&s;m, would have de&s;troyed them in the very fir&s;t place; whereas many remain in the &s;outh of Britain, as well as in the north. Tacitus, who &s;pecially mentions the de&s;truction of
<PB N="408" REF="497" MS="Y">the Druidic groves, could not have avoided men|tioning that of the temples, had any &s;uch exi&s;ted.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. In no Celtic author is there any mention of &s;uch edifices, or their u&s;e. Nennius thought Stone|henge a work of Merlin's magic. But Scandi|navian writers &s;pecially mark the u&s;e of the&s;e cir|cular monuments, namely, to hold parliaments and courts of Ju&s;tice; which, as all know, were among the Goths always held in open air, to a late period. In Iceland, which retained it's pagan cu&s;toms long, a native of Iceland, Mr. Thorkelin, profe&s;&s;or of hi&s;tory at Copenhagen, informs me the very date of erecting &s;ome of the&s;e circular monuments is known. And the u&s;e of them is retained in the old annals and laws of the country: as well as their names &s;till in the popular mouth, namely, <HI>ting,</HI> or court. I&s;lands Landnama, a work of the thirteenth century, &s;ays, <HI>Oc thar hia er &s;a domh|ringr er their daemdu menn til blota.

There Thorder Geller erected a court for one quarter, by the con&s;ent of all that quarter's men.' Adam of Bre|men &s;ays, the Danes called a council of the nation <HI>Warph</HI> or <HI>Thing</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">So <HI>Up&s;alating, Land&s;ting, Allting, Almenting,</HI> &amp;c. Loccen. Ant. Sueo Goth. p. 73, 74.</NOTE>. The&s;e courts occur of all &s;izes, from the national council down to the court of the di&s;trict. Twelve &s;tones were often &s;et for the twelve judges to &s;it under, in chief courts of ju&s;tice. But national councils had larger &s;pace, and more &s;tones; and courts for a di&s;trict, from their confined juri&s;diction, had fewer judges, and &s;tones. A rope drawn around the &s;tones impan|nelled the court, and keeped off the croud.
<PB N="409" REF="498">Greek and Roman writers afford us no light con|cerning the&s;e monuments, which is indeed &s;ur|pri&s;ing, e&s;pecially in Tacitus, who mentions the courts of the Germans held in open air. But the va&s;tne&s;s of the Roman works made them look upon monuments, which &s;trike us with &s;urprize, as beneath notice. The I&s;landic writers are in|deed late: but the argument hinges upon this, that they mark the u&s;e of the&s;e monuments, as familiar to their people; whereas not one Celtic writer gives any hint concerning their u&s;e. The argument is therefor clear and fair, that the&s;e mo|numents are Gothic, not Celtic.

Cae&s;ar &s;peaks as if all the <HI>maritime</HI> part of Britain was po&s;&s;e&s;t by the Belgae. If &s;o, they hel$$ll the &s;hores; but he can only be tru&s;t$d as to the part $span$ &s;ited</NOTE>. The people of Wales and Cornwall mu&s;t in the cour&s;e of four centuries, that the Romans held South Britain, have been mixed with Romans and Belgae. Not to mention that many of the&s;e monuments may be Dani&s;h; for the Danes, in the Ninth century, conquered Ireland, as univer&s;ally known. And from Borla&s;e him&s;elf, p. 42, 43, 372, it is clear that the Danes, in 787, &s;ettled in Cornwall, and that the Cornwallians remained under their pro|tection till 938, when conquered by Athel&s;tan, who fir&s;t brought them under the Saxon yoke. Yet Borla&s;e never thinks of a&s;&s;igning the&s;e monu|ments to the Pagan Danes! In Wales the Danes had al&s;o frequent alliance, intercour&s;e, abode. But it is mo&s;t probable that in Ireland, Wales, Cornwall, mo&s;t of the&s;e remains are really Belgic.</P>
<P>The erection of &s;uch va&s;t &s;tones, and the placing of one upon another, occa&s;ions great &s;urprize. A work upon Barbaric Arts would be curious and
<PB N="412" REF="501">intere&s;ting. In Peru the erection of regular edi|fices, with &s;tones of equal &s;ize, is certainly mat|ter of more wonder<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Voyage of Ulloa.</NOTE>. It has lately been &s;hewn that all our difficulties, concerning the barbaric monuments in Europe, may be done away by a &s;imple proce&s;s. Whole armies and tribes were employed in erecting &s;uch monuments; and what could not be done by art was effected by the numbers employed. Large mounds of earth were thrown up, with a gentle declivity, along which the &s;tone was forced with wedges of wood, and the &s;trength of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive parties. When got to the top, it was forced over an aperture, at the further and precipitous end of the mound. Another &s;tone, if required, could be placed on its top, by the &s;ame method. For circles &s;ucce&s;&s;ive mounds were made, and removed; and patience and numbers compen&s;ated the want of machines and of art.</P>
<P>But let us pa&s;s more immediately to our pre&s;ent &s;ubject. The antiquities of the Piks, the Gothic inhabitants of Scotland, may be reduced to the&s;e cla&s;&s;es.</P>

<P N="1">I. SINGLE STONES. Plain erect &s;tones are com|mon in Scotland, as in mo&s;t other countries.</P>
<P N="2">II. BARROWS. There is no authority, and no rea&s;on to believe, that the Celts ever u&s;ed to rai&s;e hillocs over their illu&s;trious dead. The plain cromlech, or little heap of &s;tones, was more con|&s;onant to their &s;avage indolence; and it is well
<PB N="413" REF="502">known, that they u&s;ed it till a late period. Bar|rows are certainly Gothic, as they were ancient Scythian. Many &s;uch have lately been opened in England, with laudable curio&s;ity. Sometimes urns are found, &s;ometimes &s;mall &s;tone coffins, in which the bones were put; &s;ometimes entire &s;kele|tons: &s;o that it is inferable that burning, or burial, was u&s;ed as opportunity &s;erved, or as &s;uper&s;tition dictated. Among the Romans, burning the dead cea&s;ed in the third century. Among the Goths it continued to be occa&s;ionally u&s;ed till their con|ver&s;ion to Chri&s;tianity. There is no room to be|lieve that the Celts ever burned their dead at all. In Scandinavia &s;epulchral mounts are frequent. They are &s;ometimes &s;urrounded with &s;tones at the bottom, and have &s;ometimes a &s;tone on the top. The tombs of the old Swedi&s;h kings near Up&s;al are all conic mounts: as are others in the ile Biorkoo.</P>
<P>Mr. Pennant, Vol. III, p. 155. de&s;cribes a &s;in|gular Cairn in the pari&s;h of Fettercairn, of va&s;t &s;ize, which he con&s;iders as &s;epulchral, an opinion which his de&s;cription renders dubious. But a large barrow near Inverne&s;s was al&s;o di&s;covered to be a pile of &s;tones and &s;ands, covered with &s;od. This was a Scandinavian mode, as may be &s;een in Dahlberg's Suecia Antiqua et Hodierna, plate 323.</P>
<P N="3">III. TEMPLES, AND PLACES OF JUDGMENT. It is &s;ingular that no ancient writer mentions tho&s;e circles of va&s;t &s;tones, which &s;trike us with &s;o much &s;urprize. Had they been Druidic temples, &s;urely, in the ancient accounts we have of the Druids, their u&s;ing &s;uch remarkable temples would not have been omitted. But the ancients mark groves as the only Druidic temples. The&s;e circles are therefore, in every appearance, chiefly Courts of Ju&s;tice. They are Gothic; and are found in Scandinavia, and in Iceland: in the la&s;t country
<PB N="414" REF="503" MS="Y">a place of this kind is called <HI>Dom-thing,</HI> implying a Court of Judgment<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Al&s;o <HI>Dombring,</HI> 'circulus judicialis.' I&s;l. Landn. p. 94.</NOTE>. In the middle is a &s;tone for the judge to &s;acrifice, who in the pagan times was always a prie&s;t; as among the Greeks, prie&s;t and king, or chief magi&s;trate, were generally united in one per&s;on. Hence the&s;e places were in fact regarded as both temples and courts of ju&s;tice: and it was no unu&s;ual thing in pagan Iceland for a human victim to be &s;acrificed, be|fore proceeding to hear cau&s;es, and admini&s;ter ju&s;tice. There is rea&s;on to conclude that Stone|henge, and other &s;uch monuments of enormous &s;tones, were u&s;ed for the &s;ame purpo&s;e The magnificence of Stonehenge, and &s;uch fabrics, may ari&s;e from their being Supreme Courts, in which the king &s;at, and rude parliaments were held; the chiefs being within, the people without the circle. For all Courts were anciently held in the open air; and the rude parliaments e&s;pecially, in which, as Tacitus expre&s;&s;ly tells, the whole people had a vote. The &s;tones acro&s;s the top of two others were apparently conveniences for the chiefs to get up, and &s;peak to the people, who, as Tacitus de&s;cribes, di&s;&s;ented by murmurs, or applauded by cla&s;hing their &s;hields. Stonehenge may have been the Supreme Court of the Belgic Britons. For the Belgae, properly by &s;uperiority &s;o called, are by Ptolemy and Richard placed in that very tract: and Sorbiodunum, their capital, was Old Sarum, as all agree. That Stonehenge, and &s;uch monuments, might ea&s;ily be erected by a &s;imple proce&s;s of rai&s;ing mounts has been lately &s;hewn; &s;o that there is no occa&s;ion to have re|cour&s;e to giants, beings of imagination. This opinion that Stonehenge was really a barbaric Par|liament Hou&s;e, being it is believed new<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">I &s;ince find the &s;ame opinion expre&s;&s;ed by M. Brotier, in his Tacitus, where at the words of the Germania, <HI>con&s;i|dunt armati,</HI> he refers to Mallet for the courts in Scandinavia; and mentions Stonehenge, and the <HI>Champs de Mars, et de Mai,</HI> and <HI>Etats Generaux,</HI> among the Francs.</NOTE>, it is,
<PB N="415" REF="504">after the various opinions of &s;o many great men concerning this wonderful monument, mo&s;t hum|bly &s;ubmitted to the reader's candour. The noble circle at Cla&s;&s;ernis in Lewis<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">See Martin's We&s;tern Iles.</NOTE> may al&s;o be of this kind; an ancient Gothic Court, in which great affairs were decided: the avenue, &amp;c. being mere pieces of rude magnificence, as the double circle is at Stonehenge, and others.</P>
<P>We are not, however, to imagine that every &s;mall circle of &s;tones is a court of ju&s;tice. Some &s;uch were family burying places: others, temples erected to &s;everal &s;mall deities. Some large ones were &s;olemn to the election of the king, or chief; and &s;uch have commonly twelve &s;tones in a circle, and a large one in the middle, upon which the king was placed and crowned, or acclaimed<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Wormius Mon. Dan. That &s;ome were burying places ap|pears from Olaus Magnus, lib. I. <HI>&s;axa, ordine &s;phaerico, familia|rium di&s;ignantia &s;epulturas:</HI> and &s;ee Dahlberg Suecia Ant. et Hod. vol. III.</NOTE>. But all kinds are Gothic, and abound in Scandi|navia. It is no wonder indeed that, while our writers take for granted that all Britain was po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by Celts, they &s;hould regard the&s;e monu|ments as Celtic. This is only a lamentable proof, among many, that they have begun at the wrong end; and pretended to illu&s;trate antiquities, without knowlege of hi&s;tory, that is, they have attempted to &s;ee without light.</P>
<P N="4">IV. CASTLES. The Piki&s;h ca&s;tles, as appears from &s;ome remains, con&s;i&s;ted of round ramparts of earth with ditches<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Gordon's Itin. Sept.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="5">V. CAVES. Subterraneous retreats in war are common to mo&s;t early nations. Tacitus<NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot">In Germania.</NOTE> tells us
<PB N="416" REF="505" MS="Y">they were u&s;ed by the Germans. In Picardy there is a mo&s;t remarkable va&s;t excavation, in the form of a St. Andrew's cro&s;s; of which a print and de&s;crip|tion are publi&s;hed<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Mem. de l'Acad. des In&s;crip.</NOTE>.

Tho&s;e of Hawthornden, near Edinburgh, are re|markable, being cut out of a free &s;tone rock, in &s;everal apartments. Some think them Piki&s;h: but they may be &s;u&s;pected Roman, as a &s;imilar work in Cumberland &s;eems to be<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Pennant's Scotland, II. 69, 70.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="6">VI. ENTRENCHMENTS. There is no proof that the ancient Gauls, Germans, or Scandinavians, ever fortified their camps as the Romans. Cae&s;ar &s;eems to mention as &s;ingular, and a fir&s;t in&s;tance, that the Gauls fortified their camp. The Gauls preceded the Germans, Britons, and Scandinavians, near three centuries, in every art, as is clear from Cae&s;ar's whole work. That great man tells us, that when the Briti&s;h Belgae rai&s;ed a rampart of felled trees, they called it a town. Oval and round intrenchments are found in Scotland; and are generally termed Dani&s;h and Piki&s;h camps. The Danes u&s;ed to fortify tops of hills in their in|va&s;ions, tho they remained but for a &s;hort time, as the Saxon Chronicle ob&s;erves. Cater-thun, and other artificial entrenchments in Scotland, of an oval and round form, &s;eem Piki&s;h works, on the model of the Roman entrenchments, round their military &s;tations; but not &s;quare as the Roman always are.</P>

<P>&dtristar; The Latin tran&s;lation in the be&s;t edition of Pto|lemy, that of Bertius, Am&s;t. 1618, is often in|correctly printed in the numerals, and varies from the Greek: thus <HI>Veruvium prom.</HI> in the Greek has 30: 50 in the Latin 39: 50&mdash;<HI>Ripa Alta</HI> in Gr. 29, Lat. 39&mdash;<HI>Orrea</HI> Gr. 24. 15&equals;58. 45, Lat. 26. 15&equals;59. 45&mdash;<HI>Devana,</HI> Gr. 26. 15&equals;59. 45, Lat. 19. 15&equals;57. 45&mdash;<HI>Thule</HI> on ea&s;t 31 in Gr. 21 in Lat. The&s;e &s;hameful inaccuracies may &s;hew how much a new edition of Ptolemy is wanted; for they are mere errors, and not varia|tions of the old Latin tran&s;lation.</P>
<P>The author has peru&s;ed this part of Ptolemy in 13 or 14 editions: but the only other remarkable variations are in that of 1482, or the &s;econd edition. To <HI>Deva</HI> it gives 17&deg; for 18&deg;&mdash;to <HI>Lindum,</HI> with all the Latin editions, it a&s;&s;igns 23&deg;, tho the Greek erroneou&s;ly has 20&deg;&mdash;and between <HI>Curia</HI> and <HI>Bremenium</HI> it intro|duces a &s;econd <HI>Alauna,</HI> 23&deg;&mdash;58 &frac23;&deg;: it is believed rightly, for the Geographus Ravennas has another Alauna, as pre&s;ently to be mentioned. The ed. 1482 has thus two Alaunas, but the old copiers &s;eem to have omitted the &s;econd, as thinking it only the fir&s;t mi&s;placed. For <HI>Ocetis</HI> it reads <HI>Scetis,</HI> as does a fine Latin MS. in the Mu&s;aeum, of Angelo's tran&s;lation about 1450; that of Boetius is unfortunately lo&s;t. In both Greek and Latin <HI>Devana</HI> has 59&mdash;45, but it mu&s;t be corrected 58&mdash;45, as all the maps bear, or 59, as edd. 1, 2.</P>

<HEAD>GEOGRAPHUS RAVENNAS.</HEAD>
<P>THIS geographer &s;eems to have lived in the eighth century. His work, tho written in the mo&s;t bar|barous &s;tyle, is curious and valuable, but &s;tands in need of an able and learned commentator.</P>
<P>In de&s;cribing Britain, he mentions the arrival of the Saxons under An&s;chis, (Hengi&s;t); and &s;ays, the Gothic philo&s;ophers, that is Aithanarid, Heldebald, and Marco|mir, whom he often quotes in his accounts, called this iland a microco&s;m. He then gives a li&s;t of many <HI>civitates et ca&s;tra,</HI> 'towns and camps', in Britain.</P>
<P>Tho he ob&s;erves not much order in this li&s;t, yet he palpably begins with the &s;outhern part of Britain, and after pa&s;&s;es to the north; as appears from many of his names to be found in Ptolemy, the Notitia, and Impe|rial Itinerary. His arrival at the north is marked by his fir&s;t giving us many names together, to be found in the preceding <HI>Per lincam Valli</HI> of the Notitia, as <HI>Gabrocentio, Derventione, Magnis, Vindo$ante, Cogangis,</HI> &amp;c. and next by his &s;aying "Iterum, &s;unt civitates in ip&s;a Britannia quae recto tramite de una parte in alia, id e&s;t de oceano in oceano, et Si&s;tuntiaci dividunt in tertia portione ip&s;am Britanniam, id e&s;t Serduno, Conderco, Vindovala, On|no, Celunno, Brocoliti," &amp;c. For all the&s;e names are to be found in the above <HI>Per lineam Valli</HI> of the Notitia; only here they are corrupted, like the other names in the book, to a kind of $talian: and the Si&s;tuntii, as well known, were in pre&s;ent Cumberland, clo&s;e to Hadrian's wall.</P>
<P>Hor&s;ley in his Britannia Romana has therefor rightly put the following names as belonging to pre&s;ent Scot|land.</P>
<P>"Clidum, CARBANTIUM, Tadoriton, Maporiton, Alitacenon, Loxa, Locatrene, Canibroiana, Smetri, UXELA, LUCOTION, CORDA, Camulo&s;e&s;&s;a, PRAESIDI|UM, Brigomono, Abi&s;&s;on, Ebio, Coritiotar, Celerion, Itucodon, Maremago, Duabli&s;is, Venutio, TRIMUN|TIUM,
<PB N="430" REF="518">Eburoca&s;lum, BREMENIUM, Cocuneda, ALAU|NA, Oleiclavis, Ejuden&s;ca, Rumabo. Iterum &s;unt civi|tates in ip&s;a Britannia ubi plus angu&s;ti&s;&s;ima de oceano in oceano e&s;&s;e dino&s;citur. Id e&s;t Velunia, Volitan$o, Pexa, Bege&s;e, COLANICA, MEDIO, Nemeton, Subdo|biadon, Litana, Cibra, Credigone. Iterum e&s;t civitas, quae dicitur Iana, Manlion, Demero&s;e&s;a, Cindocelum, Cermo, Veromo, Matovion, Ugrulentum, Ranatonium, IBERRAN, Praematis, TUESSIS, Ledone, Litinomago, DEVONI, Memanturum, Decha, Bograndium, Ugue&s;te, Leviodanum, Pareo Cla&s;&s;is, Levioxana, Cermium, VIC|TORIAE, Marcotaxon, Tagea, Voran."</P>
<P>The following ilands, from his account, clearly be|long to the Hebudes in part.</P>
<P>"Iterum ip&s;i oceano occidentali ponuntur diver&s;ae in&s;ulae, ex quibus aliquantas nominare volumus; id e&s;t Cor&s;ula, MONA, REGAINA, Minervae, Cunis, MANNA, Botis, Vinion, Saponis, Su&s;ura, Birila, Elaviani, Sobri|ca, Scetis, Linnon&s;a."</P>
<P>He then adds the following ilands, which may per|haps be the Scilly ilands, or &s;ome others in the we&s;tern ocean, for none of their names &s;eem to infer any of the Hebudes. "Item ad aliam partem dicitur in&s;ula Ma|ganica, Anas, Cana, Atino, Elete, Daroecla, E&s;&s;igra|dena, Maiona, Longis, Cirimon, Exo&s;adeos, ubi et gemmae na&s;cuntur." He immediately adds, "Legimus ut in ip&s;o oceano jam expleta parte occidentali, tanquam ad partem ingredientes meridianam, &s;unt in&s;ulae numero triginta tres, quae et Dorcadas appellatur." This intel|ligence that the Orkneys lay on the &s;outh of the we&s;tern ocean is &s;ingular: but this writer al&s;o &s;ays, that the Orkneys are on the ea&s;t of Britain; Gaul and the Pyre|nees on the we&s;t; Ireland on the north; and Germany on the &s;outh!</P>
<P>But errors in the greater parts of geography invalidate not his names of places in Britain, which de&s;erve a few remarks. The towns put in capital letters are found in Ptolemy, the Notitia, and the Itinerary given by Richard of Cirence&s;ter. The others are unknown. Hor&s;ley conjectures that <HI>Clidum</HI> is Gla&s;gow, upon no grounds, it being put among the towns near the wall of Hadrian. For it is clear from the author's mention of the Si&s;tuntii, and from his after pa&s;&s;ing to the towns &s;ituated where Britain is narrowe&s;t, that is at the wall of Antoninus, that he under&s;tood the <HI>Per lineam Valli</HI> of the Notitia to
<PB N="431" REF="519">refer to the wall of Hadrian. This &s;eems to confirm Hor&s;ley's account of the &s;tations, controverted in p. 51. of this volume. At &s;ame time it &s;erves to e&s;tabli&s;h that curious fact, that the Roman walls were not the utmo&s;t bounds of their power in Britain; for while they held Valentia, &s;till the &s;tations were at the &s;outhern wall, that is this wall was the real fortified barrier. <HI>Carban|tium</HI> is palpably the <HI>Carbantium</HI> of Richard, and <HI>Carban|torigum</HI> of Ptolemy, now thought to be Kircudbright. <HI>Uxella</HI> is the <HI>Uxellum</HI> of Ptolemy. <HI>Lucotion</HI> the <HI>Luco|pibia. Corda</HI> is the &s;outhern <HI>Coria</HI> of Ptolemy. <HI>Tri|muntium</HI> is the <HI>Trimontium</HI> of Ptolemy. <HI>Bremenium</HI> lay near it, but in pre&s;ent England. The <HI>Alauna</HI> here &s;eems evidently a &s;tation on the river Alauna near Bremenium; if the geographer has not confounded the river it&s;elf with a &s;tation; for it cannot be Alauna on the north of Forth, the other names all lying near the &s;outhern wall, as the author &s;ays, and as evident from tho&s;e known. Hor&s;ley's conjectures that Alitacenon is Elgin; Loxa, Innerlochy; Celerion, Calendar; Duabli&s;is. Duplin; &amp;c. are therefor ridiculou&s;ly ab&s;urd, and founded merely on an imagined re&s;emblance of names.</P>
<P>The geographer next pa&s;&s;es to the places near the narrowe&s;t part of Britain, that is near the wall of Anto|ninus between Clyde and Forth. Of there <HI>Colanica,</HI> or <HI>Colania,</HI> is found in Ptolemy and Richard, and thought to be pre&s;ent Lanerk. <HI>Medio</HI> is found in Richard's Iti|nerary, nine miles on the north of Orrea, or near the Tay: but po&s;&s;ibly there was another in the middle of the wall of Antoninus. The other names here are quite unknown.</P>
<P>Our author then pa&s;&s;es to other places, which, as we can judge from the few known, were more to the north than the former. <HI>Tue&s;&s;is</HI> and <HI>Victoria</HI> are known from Ptolemy. <HI>Iberran</HI> &s;eems the <HI>Hierna</HI> of Richards. <HI>De|voni,</HI> the <HI>Devana</HI> of Ptolemy. <HI>Tagea,</HI> the <HI>Tamea</HI> of Pto|lemy. The dreams of Hor&s;ley on the re&s;t are beneath notice.</P>
<P>Of the ilands <HI>Mona</HI> is Angle&s;ey. <HI>Manna,</HI> Maun. <HI>Regaina</HI> is &s;urely the <HI>Ricina</HI> of Ptolemy, the <HI>Racina</HI> of Richard, or <HI>Rachlin. Botis</HI> &s;eems Bute. <HI>Scetis,</HI> Scia or Skey. The re&s;t can hardly be gue&s;t at.</P>

<HEAD><HI>NUMBER IV.</HI> Dio's Account of the Expedition of Severus into Caledonia.</HEAD>
<P>A Fragment of Dio in the excerpts of Theodo&s;ius, publi&s;hed by Leunclavius, bears the following &s;hort notice concerning the Caledonians, ju&s;t before the battle between Severus and Albinus, or the year of Chri&s;t 198. "Then al&s;o in Britain, beau&s;e the Cale|donii did not abide by their engagements, but were pre|pared to defend the Maeatae, while Severus at that time was intent on the approaching war, Lupus was forced to purcha&s;e peace of the Maeatae, by paying a large &s;um of money, getting back however a few captives." It is well known that there are more coins of Commodus with BRITANNIA, or VICTORIA BRIT. than of Antoninus Pius or Severus: and it appears that Mar|cellus, the general of Commodus in Britain, &s;ubdued the Maeatae, and forced the Caledonians to the above mentioned engagements, about the year 183.</P>
<P>But before Severus went into Britain his generals there had obtained &s;ome advantage, for Dio mentions his anger that he could not &s;eize Bulas the robber, "while by the help of others he &s;ubdued his foes in Bri|tain." Then follows the account of his celebrated ex|pedition into Britain, as excerpted by Xiphilin, for the greater part of Dio's hi&s;tory is lo&s;t.</P>
<P>"After this Severus proceeded into Britain with his army, perceiving that his &s;ons were intemperate, and that the legions di&s;&s;olving in ea&s;e became corrupt. This expedition he entered upon, tho he knew that he &s;hould never return, by con&s;idering the &s;tars under which he was born: and who&s;e appearance he had cau&s;ed to be painted in the cieling of the hall in the palace, where he gave judgment, evident to all; except as to the hour of his birth by the Greeks called horo&s;cope, for this he delineated on both &s;ides in different ways. He al&s;o knew his fate from the &s;ooth-&s;ayers. For a thunderbolt &s;truck that gate, thro which he was to lead his army, and da&s;hed out three letters of his name. Severus therefor,
<PB N="437" REF="525">as was foretold by the &s;ooth-&s;ayers, never did return, but died the third year after, having ama&s;&s;ed great trea|&s;ures."</P>
<P>"Of the [barbaric] Britons there are two great na|tions, called Caledonii and Maeatae; for the re&s;t are ge|nerally referred to the&s;e. The Maeatae dwell near that wall which divides the iland into two parts. The Caledonians inhabit beyond them. They both po&s;&s;e&s;s rugged and dry mountains, and de&s;ert plains full of mar&s;hes. They have neither ca&s;tles nor towns; nor do they cultivate the ground; but live on their flocks and hunting, and the fruits of &s;ome trees; not eating fi&s;h, tho extremely plenteous. They live in tents, naked and without bu&s;kins. Wives they have in common, and breed up their children in common. The general form of government is democratic. They are addicted to robbery; fight in cars; have &s;mall and &s;wift hor&s;es. Their infantry are remarkable for &s;peed in running, and for firmne&s;s in &s;tanding. Their armour con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;hield; and a &s;hort &s;pear, in the lower end of which is a brazen apple, who&s;e &s;ound, when &s;truck, may terrify the enemy; they have al&s;o daggers. Famine, cold, and all &s;orts of labour they can bear, for they will even &s;tand in their mar&s;hes for many days, up to the neck in water, and in the woods will live on the bark and roots of trees. They prepare a certain kind of food on all occa&s;ions, of which taking only a bit the &s;ize of a bean, they feel neither hunger nor thir&s;t. Such is Britain, and &s;uch are the inhabitants of that part, which wars again&s;t the Romans. That it is an iland has been &s;hewn before. Its length is &s;even thou&s;and one hundred and thirty-two &s;tadia: its utmo&s;t breadth two thou&s;and three hun|dred and ten &s;tadia; its lea&s;t breadth three hundred &s;ta|dia."</P>
<P>"Of this iland not much le&s;s than the half is ours. Severus wi&s;hing to reduce the whole under his power entered into Caledonia. In his march he met with un&s;peakable difficulties, in cutting down woods, level|ling eminences, rai&s;ing banks acro&s;s the mar&s;hes, and building bridges over the rivers. He fought no battle, the enemy never appearing in array, but advi&s;edly plac|ing &s;heep and oxen in the way of our troops, that while our &s;oldiers attempted to &s;eize them, and by the fraud were drawn into defiles, they might be ea&s;ily cut off The lakes likewi&s;e were de&s;tructive to our men, as dividing them, &s;o that they fell into ambu&s;cades; and
<PB N="438" REF="526">while they could not be brought off, were &s;lain by our army, that they might not fall into the hands of the enemy. Owing to the&s;e cau&s;es, there died no le&s;s than fifty thou&s;and of our troops. Severus however did not de&s;i&s;t till he had reached the extreme part of the iland, where he diligently remarked the diver&s;ity of the &s;olar cour&s;e, and the length of the nights and days in &s;um|mer and winter. At la&s;t, after having been carried thro mo&s;t of the ho&s;tile land, (for becau&s;e of his weakne&s;s he was generally borne in an open litter), he returned to the friendly part of Britain, the [barbaric] Britons being forced to conclude an alliance, on condition that they &s;hould yield up no &s;mall part of their country."</P>
<P>Xiphilin from Dio then relates that Severus, in a conference with the Caledonians, had almo&s;t been &s;lain by his &s;on Antoninus Caracalla. He then adds:</P>
<P>"After this the Britons again revolted; upon which Severus a&s;&s;embling his army, ordered them to invade the country, and to give no quarter; repeating the&s;e ver&s;es:</P>
<Q><L>Let none e&s;cape your hands, and cruet &s;laughter,</L>
<L>Not even the babe yet guiltle&s;s in the womb.</L></Q>
<P>And finding that the Caledonii as well as the Maeatae bad ari&s;en, he prepared to conduct the war him&s;elf, but was prevented by death." Xiphilin la&s;t mentions as happening during the &s;hort truce, the noted reply of a Caledonian lady to Julia the empre&s;s.</P>

Of the nations who anciently inhabited either bank of the Rhine, each had its peculiar name. Of the&s;e nations one is now called Germans, a name formerly common to all. The ile of BRITTIA is &s;ituated in this ocean, not more than two hundred &s;tadia from the continent, and oppo&s;ite the mouth of the Rhine, being between BRITAIN and the ile THULE. But BRITAIN, lying to|ward the &s;etting &s;un, where it is oppo&s;ite to furthe&s;t Spain, is about four thou&s;and &s;tadia from the conti|nent. BRITTIA is oppo&s;ite to the furthe&s;t parts of Gaul, which &s;tretch to the ocean, being on the northern &s;ide of SPAIN and BRITAIN. THULE, &s;o far as mor|tals can di&s;cover, is removed to the extreme of the Northern Ocean. But i have &s;poken of BRITAIN and THULE in former books.</P>
<P>The ile of BRITTIA is inhabited by three mo&s;t nu|merous nations, each under its proper king, namely, the ANGLI, FRISONES, and the BRITTONS &s;ynony|mous with the ile. So great is the multitude of its people, that every year, not a few, with their wives and children, migrate into <HI>France,</HI> where habitations in de&s;ert grounds are a&s;&s;igned them: whence it is &s;aid the <HI>Franci</HI> claim &s;ome right to the iland it&s;elf<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Accurate rea&s;oner!</NOTE>. Cer|tainly the king of the <HI>Franci,</HI> not long ago, when he
<PB N="440" REF="528">&s;ent &s;ome of his familiar &s;ervants amba&s;&s;ors to Ju&s;ti|nian the emperor, joined &s;ome ANGLI to their train; proudly &s;hewing that he al&s;o commanded this i&s;land. So much for the iland BRITTIA.</P>
<P>Not long ago HERMEGISCLUS reigned over the <HI>Varni.</HI> He de&s;iring to &s;trengthen his kingdom, had married the &s;i&s;ter of THEODEBERT, king of the <HI>Franci;</HI> his former wife, who left him one &s;on, called RADIGER, being lately dead. Him the father e&s;pou&s;ed to a virgin of BRITTIA, who&s;e brother was then king of the ANGLI, and in the name of marriage-gift HERMEGI|SCLUS &s;ent her a great &s;um of money. On a time, rid|ing in the fields with the chiefs of the <HI>Varni,</HI> he &s;aw a bird &s;itting on a tree, and croaking di&s;agreeably. Then, either that he under&s;tood the &s;ong of the bird, or pre|tended to know an omen from it, he immediately &s;aid to his company, that he &s;hould die in forty days, as he learned from the augury of the bird; then added, <Q>&startq;But i have exerted all my prudence that you &s;hould live in &s;afety and ea&s;e, and for that cau&s;e have con|tracted an affinity with the <HI>Franci,</HI> having married my wife from their race, and e&s;pou&s;ed my &s;on to a wife from BRITTIA. Yet now, when i know that i &s;hall &s;hortly die, nor have received either male or female offspring from my la&s;t marriage, nor is my &s;on's marriage yet con&s;ummated, hear my advice, and if you &s;ee good, follow it as &s;oon as i depart this life. I think then that the affinity of the <HI>Franci</HI> is of more importance to us <HI>Varni,</HI> than that of the ilanders; for the BRITTII cannot enter into commerce with us, but with difficulty; while only the river Rhine &s;epa|rates us from the <HI>Franci.</HI> Wherefore while the&s;e la&s;t are near, and very powerful, they can ea&s;ily do us good or evil, when they plea&s;e: and mu&s;t be our ene|mies unle&s;s joined by affinity. For &s;uch is the nature of men, that they hardly bear the power of a neighbour greater than their own; and thus are ready to injure, for a &s;trong neighbour ea&s;ily finds occa&s;ions of war. Wherefore &s;end to the iland-bride of my &s;on, and whatever money &s;he has received from us as a mar|riage gift, let her keep it, to atone for the ignominy, as the common law of mankind orders. But let RADIGER, my &s;on, marry his &s;tep-mothers &s;ince the &endq;law of our country permits.</Q></P>
<PB N="441" REF="529">
<P>Having &s;poken thus he died, the fortieth day after the prediction. The &s;on of HERMEGISCLUS &s;ucceed|ing to the kingdom of the <HI>Varni,</HI> by the advice of the chiefs of that barbarous nation, followed the coun&s;el of the decea&s;t king; and immediately renouncing his bride, married his &s;tep-mother. Which when his bride heard, impatient of the indignity, &s;he eagerly de&s;ired revenge. For the&s;e barbarians value mode&s;ty &s;o much, that a woman &s;eems to have forfeited it who is be|trothed but fails of marriage. And fir&s;t by &s;ome of her familiar friends, whom &s;he &s;ent to RADIGER, &s;he enquired the cau&s;e why &s;he was &s;o ba&s;ely left, when &s;he had in no &s;hape violated her faith. But this way avail|ing nothing, with a manly mind &s;he prepared for war. Immediately therefore making ready four hundred &s;hips, filled with at lea&s;t ten thou&s;and &s;oldiers, &s;he her|&s;elf led this army again&s;t the <HI>Varni:</HI> having taken with her, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the management of her affairs, one of her brothers, not the king, but a private man. But the&s;e ilanders are, of all the barbarians we know, the brave&s;t. They fight on foot, not only ignorant of riding, but ignorant what a hor&s;e is, the image of one being never &s;een in that country. For this animal is never beheld in BRITTIA; and if at any time the&s;e ilanders, on account of an emba&s;&s;y, or the like, have any bu&s;ine&s;s with the <HI>Romans,</HI> or <HI>Franci,</HI> or any other people u&s;ing hor&s;es, and mu&s;t then of nece&s;&s;ity ride, they know not how to leap on a hor&s;e, but are lifted up by others; and when they wi&s;h to di&s;mount, are helped down. The <HI>Varni</HI> are al&s;o not hor&s;emen, but all fight on foot. Such are the&s;e barbarians. All are rowers aboard their ve&s;&s;els; and no other &s;ea-&s;ervice is required; for they u&s;e no &s;ails, but always navigate with oars.</P>
<P>After they landed on the continent, the virgin-ge|neral rai&s;ing a rampart near the mouth of the Rhine, remained there with a few troops; and de&s;ired her bro|ther to lead the re&s;t again&s;t the enemy. Then the <HI>Varni</HI> formed their camp, not far from the &s;ea and mouths of the Rhine, where, when the ANGLI &s;oon arrived, battle was joined, and the <HI>Varni</HI> defeated with great &s;laughter, the &s;urvivors flying with the king. The ANGLI pur&s;uing them but a little way, as foot-men could do, returned to their camp. The virgin bitterly reviled them, and loaded her brother with reproaches;
<PB N="442" REF="530">affirming that they had done nothing, who had not brought RADIGER to her alive. Having then cho&s;en a band of the brave&s;t, &s;he ordered them to u&s;e every means to take him. They obeying her carefully, &s;earched all the region round, till they found RADIGER lurking in a thick wood, and brought him bound be|fore the virgin, while he &s;tood trembling in expectation of immediate death. But &s;he, beyond hope, neither puni&s;hed him capitally, nor &s;everely; but thinking it enough to reproach him for his conduct, the a&s;ked him the cau&s;e why, breaking his faith, he had wedded another, and that while his bride was free from fault? He, excu&s;ing the deed, pleaded the command of his fa|ther, and the advice of his chiefs: and with earne&s;t en|treaty, a&s;cribing his crime to nece&s;&s;ity, he promi&s;ed to be her hu&s;band if &s;he would, and to atone for his faults by future offices. The maid con&s;enting, RA|DIGER was freed from his chains, and kindly treated. Soon after having &s;ent back the &s;i&s;ter of THEODEBERT, he married the virgin of BRITTIA. So ended this matter.</P>
<P>In that iland, BRITTIA, the ancients built a long wall, which divides a great part of it from the other; becau&s;e that the affections of the &s;oil and &s;ky, and all things el&s;e, differ much in the&s;e two parts. For the region which reaches from the wall to the ri&s;ing &s;un, enjoys a healthy heaven, and ju&s;t &s;ea&s;ons; the &s;ummer being temperately hot, the winter moderately cold; and it abounds with inhabitants who live like other people. The trees &s;hine with fruits in their &s;ea&s;ons, and happy harve&s;ts ri&s;e, as el&s;ewhere; the land is al&s;o peculiarly ble&s;t with wealth of water. But on the we&s;t all is quite the con|trary, &s;o that a man could not live there half an hour. Vipers, innumerable &s;erpents, and venomous bea&s;ts of all kinds, obtain that region Nay, what is very re|mote from common ideas, the BRITTI relate that if any man pa&s;&s;es over the wall, he that moment expires, op|pre&s;t with the pe&s;tilent gale. Animals al&s;o who go be|yond the wall are &s;eized with in&s;tant death. And &s;ince i am fallen upon this part of hi&s;tory, it becomes nece&s;|&s;ary to commemorate a matter very like a fable. Which however i do not think true, tho related by many people, who a&s;&s;erted their being on the &s;pot where it happens, and their hearing what was &s;aid. Nor do i think proper to pa&s;s this, lea&s;t in de&s;cribing the affairs of the ile BRITTIA, i &s;hould &s;eem ignorant of any one of them.</P>
<PB N="443" REF="531">
<P>They relate therefore that the &s;ouls of dead men are accu&s;tomed to be carried there: and the manner this is done i &s;hall &s;oon declare, as i have heard it from the inhabitants of the&s;e parts, who related it very &s;eriou&s;ly: which, however commonly told, i imagine to be delu|&s;ions of &s;leep. Many villages croud the &s;hore of the region oppo&s;ite to the iland BRITTIA; in which villages dwell fi&s;hers, farmers, and others, who navi|gate into that iland for the &s;ake of trade. They are &s;ubject to the kings of the <HI>Franci,</HI> but always free from tribute, being relieved of old from this burden, on ac|count of &s;ome &s;ervice of which i &s;hall now &s;peak. The natives tell, that they have power, each in his turn, of bringing &s;ouls into this other world. Wherefore they, who are to enjoy that privilege next night, going to their hou&s;es fall a&s;leep, expecting the pre&s;ident of the bu&s;ine&s;s. Late at night they hear knocking at their doors, and an ob&s;cure voice &s;ummon them to the ta&s;k. Rejecting all delay, they ri&s;e from their beds, and go to the &s;hore, ignorant by what force they are driven, but yet ab&s;olutely forced. There they &s;ee boats ready, not their own, but others, and empty. Entering them they &s;eize the oars, and perceive the ve&s;&s;els quite full of pa&s;&s;engers, &s;o that they are immer&s;t to within an inch of the water. They &s;ee nobody; nor do they take more than an hour to reach BRITTIA, altho when they u&s;e their own ve&s;&s;els, and oars alone without &s;ails, they hardly pa&s;s thither in a day and a night. Arriving at the ile, as &s;oon as they find their pa&s;&s;engers landed, they depart; the ve&s;&s;els being &s;uddenly un|loaded, and &s;o emergent that the keels alone are under water. They &s;ee none, either navigating or leaving the &s;hip; only they a&s;&s;ert they hear a voice which &s;eems to repeat the name of each pa&s;&s;enger, his former &s;tation of life, and the name of his father. If any wo|men are with them, the names of their hu&s;bands are al&s;o called. So the natives report. But i return to my &s;ubject.</P>

<BIBL>R. Populton~.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Id e&s;t:</HI> Qui tran&s;cripta compilavit. Ego frater Petrus Maymeti, ordinis beatae Mariae de Carmelo, exi&s;tens Scolaris Pari&s;iis, illum libellum manu propria &s;crip&s;i, et ab&s;traxi a quodam exemplari valde antiquo, et cum dyptongis &s;cripto, in quo Cirillus cum &s;acris et &s;acer|dotalibus ve&s;tibus, et frater Eu&s;ebius cum mantello barrato, et An|gelus ve&s;te, in principio erant curio&s;e et mirabiliter depicti. R. PO|PULTON.
<P>This certainly refers only to the prophecy of Cyril. And the &s;ig|nature of Populton, here and before, fully marks that he was the real writer, and collector of this MS. from various ancient pieces, which he had found; perhaps chiefly in the great library founded at York in early times: the title of No. 29, bearing 'Pray for Populton who compiled me at York:' and the clo&s;e of that No. and No. 30, ex|pre&s;s that Robert de Populton was a monk. M. Van Praet thinks the writing French; but &s;ome fac-&s;imilia in my hands te&s;tify it the common writing u&s;ed in England, in the fourteenth century. Yet that Populton may have been educated, and taught to write, at Paris, is not improbable, &s;uppo&s;ing M. Van Praet's idea to be well-founded.</P></NOTE></BIBL></Q>

<P>PICTI propria lingua nomen habent a picto cor|pore; eo quod, aculeis ferreis cum atramento, variarum figurarum &s;tigmate annotantur. Scotti, (qui nunc corrupt&egrave; vocantur Hibernien&s;es) qua&s;i Sciti, quia a Scithia regione venerunt, et inde originem duxe|runt; &s;ive a Scotta filia Pharaonis regis Aegypti, quae fuit ut fertur regina Scottorum,</P>
<P>Sciendum vero e&s;t quod Britones in tertia mundi aetate ad Britanniam venerunt. Scitae autem, id e&s;t Scotti, in quarta aetate Scociam, &s;ive Hiberniam obti|nuerunt.</P>
<P>Gentes Scitiae albo crine na&s;cuntur ab a&s;&s;iduis nivi|bus; et ip&s;ius capilli color genti nomen dedit, et inde dicuntur Albani: de quibus originem duxerunt Scotti et Picti. Horum glauca oculis (id e&s;t picta) ine&s;t pu|pilla, adeo ut nocte plu&s;quam die cernant. Albani au|tem vicini Amazonibus fuerunt.</P>
<P>Gothi a Magog filio Japheth nominati putantur, de &s;imilitudine ultimae &s;yllabae; quos veteres Graeci magis Gethas, quam Gothos, vocaverunt. Gens fortis et potenti&s;&s;ima, corporum mole ardua, armorum genere terribilis. De quibus Lucanus,

<P>The i&s;land of Briton was &s;o called from Briton, &s;on of I&s;icon, viz. in the fir&s;t con&s;ul&s;hip of the Romans; its fir&s;t name was Albion; it is 200 miles in breadth, and contains 28 chief cities, viz. Caer-Goirthighernd. Caer-Gutais, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Here begins the hi&s;tory of the Cruitne.</P>
<P>The Cruitne came from Thrace; they were the &s;ons or clann of Gelon of Hercules: they were called Aga|thyr&s;i. Six brothers came over chiefs or leaders; viz. Solen, Ulfa, Neachtan, Dro&s;ten, Aengus, Letcind.</P>
<P>Fatha-atiactana, alias Policornus, king of Thrace, fell in love with their &s;i&s;ter, and endeavoured to &s;educe her, without &s;ettling a dowry on her. Then they
<PB N="505" REF="593" MS="Y">pa&s;&s;ed through the (country of the) Romans to that of the Franks, and there built a city, viz. Pictavis, &s;o called from Pictis, that is a kind of arms or weapons. And the king of the Franks fell in love with their &s;i&s;|ter. Then the &s;ixth brother Letcind, dying, they roamed about the &s;eas, and it &s;o happened that the &s;i&s;ter dying on &s;hipboard, the Cruitne made for Inver Slaine in Hy-Kin&s;illagh (in Lein&s;ter).</P>
<P>Creamthan Sciathbal king of Lein&s;ter told them, they &s;hould be welcome, provided they would free him of the <HI>tribe</HI> widows. Dro&s;tan, alias Bleogan, a prie&s;t or Druid of the Cruitne, replied, to-morrow at the ri&s;ing of the &s;un (the milk of) &s;even &s;core white cows &s;hall be &s;pilt; this occa&s;ioned an engagement, and they fought the battle of Arda leamnacta in Hy-Kin&s;illigh; where not one e&s;caped being wounded or &s;peared, receiving no &s;upport from their hor&s;es or ****.</P>
<P>Then all the widows died: after that died Dro&s;tan, Solen, Neachtan, Ulfa of the Cruitne.</P>
<P>Cathluan began to gather great &s;trength and power in Ireland, till he was expelled by Erimon, who gave his people women and land; and they &s;ettled in Breag|maigh: they were in want of order or di&s;tinction; had neither &s;pears (for hunting) nets (for fowling) or wo|men.</P>
<P>Cathluan was chief over all; and he fir&s;t led them to Alban.</P>
<P>LXX Kings over Alban from Cathluan to Con&s;tan|&s;tane; and he was the la&s;t of the Cruitinian (kings). He left two &s;ons, Catinolodar and Catinolocan, both in great di&s;tre&s;s.

<L>Sed trans Dun-Alban, coepit regnare Kenedus.</L>
<L>Sed cum &s;eptenis Kened regnaverat annis,</L>
<L>Ex tunc Albaniae regnum totale regebat.</L></Q>
<P>Before commenting on this ob&s;cure pa&s;&s;age, it will be proper to offer a few remarks on the ideas of &s;ome other old Scoti&s;h writers relating to this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Innes has ob&s;erved, in his critical E&s;&s;ay, that after the year 1301, when the di&s;pute with Edward I. aro&s;e, we fir&s;t find the Scoti&s;h writers claiming a priority of &s;ettement, for the Iri&s;h Scots, over the Piks.</P>
<PB N="508" REF="596">
<P>Baldred Bi&s;&s;et, in his Memorial to the Pope, 1301, a&s;&s;erts wildly that the Scots had thirty-&s;ix catholic kings before the Engli&s;h were converted.</P>
<P>A writer in Fordun's Scotichronicon, IV. 10, &s;ays the Scots had twenty-three kings, before the Piks came into Britain; which by his account was about 200 years before Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>The letter of the Scoti&s;h nobility to the Pope, 1320, &s;ays that Robert Bruce was the 113th king of Scots. But this number, as appears from Innes, p. 712, ex|tends from Simon Brec, fir&s;t king of the Scots in Ire|land.</P>
<P>Winton, Book IV. informs us:</P>
<Q><L>Four hundreth winter, and fourty,</L>
<L>And twa, to rekkyne evynly,</L>
<L>Before the bli&s;t nativitie, &amp;c.</L>
<L>As in our &s;torie written is,</L>
<L>Than in Scotland the Scottis</L>
<L>Begouth to ring, and to &s;teir;</L>
<L>Twa hundreth fullie, and forty yeir,</L>
<L>Five winteir, and moneths thrie,</L>
<L>Gif that all &s;uld rekkynit be,</L>
<L>Or the Peychtis into Scotland</L>
<L>Cam, and in it were regnand.</L></Q>
<P>He al&s;o &s;ays that when Kenneth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Winton gives no po&s;itive date for this event. Alpin's reign he dates 840, Kenneth's 843 (in Dalriada), Kenneth's death 859.</NOTE> vanqui&s;hed the Piks, the later had been &s;overeigns of Scotland,</P>
<Q>A thou&s;and, ane and &s;ixty yheres.</Q>
<P>And, &s;ome chapters after, he dates the coming of the Piks from Scythia to Scotland,</P>
<Q><L>Twa hundreth wintyr, and na mair,</L>
<L>Or that the madyn Marie bair.</L></Q>
<P>Fordun, I. 31, &s;ays that, according to an old chro|nicle, the Scots came to Scotland 1543 years before Chri&s;t: the Scots reigned before the Piks 249 years, 3 months: and the Piki&s;h kingdom la&s;ted 1061 years: but by other accounts, 1224 years, 9 months. In book I. cap. ult. he remarks that &s;ome accounts bore that the Scots reigned before the Piks 265 years, 3 months: others 317 years under 23 kings. In IV. 10, he repeats the&s;e remarks. But he him&s;elf allows, I. 37, that the Piks and Scots were in Britain about one and the &s;ame time.</P>
<PB N="509" REF="597" MS="Y">
<P>Giraldus Cambren&s;is, in his <HI>De&s;criptio Albaniae,</HI> &s;ays, that &s;ome made the Piki&s;h kingdom la&s;t 1070, others 1360, years.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations being premi&s;ed, the above ob&s;cure pa&s;&s;age remains to be con&s;idered.</P>
<Q><L>Bis bis centeno, quater endeca, &s;ed minus uno</L>
<L>Anno, quo &s;ump&s;it primos Ergadia Scotos,</L>
<L>Ut referunt i&s;ti, fuit incarnatio Chri&s;ti.</L></Q>
<P><HI>Bis bis centeno</HI> is 'the twice two hundredth', that is 400: <HI>quater endeca</HI> 'four times eleven' is 44; <HI>minus uno</HI> 'le&s;s by one' leaves for the &s;um 443 years. After <HI>anno</HI> &s;upply <HI>a,</HI> and the clear &s;en&s;e is, 443 years after the Scots arrived in Argyle was the Incarnation of Chri&s;t; that is the Scots came to Argyle 443 years before Chri&s;t. Winton reckons only 442, in the above pa&s;&s;age. For|dun no where expre&s;&s;ly marks the year when the Scots came in; but &s;uppo&s;es them to have been in Britain &s;ome time before Fergus I. who&s;e reign he dates, II. 12, in the 330th year before Chri&s;t.</P>
<Q><L>Annorum &s;umma, Pictis praeoccupatorum,</L>
<L>Hic dat Scotorum, deca quinque centibinorum,</L>
<L>Et annos quindecim; tres men&s;es jungito quidem.</L></Q>
<P><HI>Deca quinque</HI> 'five tens' fifty: <HI>centibinorum'</HI> two hun|dred:' <HI>quindecim, tres men&s;es;</HI> in all 265 years 3 months, as Fordun above interprets. But Winton has 245.</P>
<Q><L>Qui Picti terram rexere mille, ducentis,</L>
<L>Et pariter junctis viginti quatuor annis,</L>
<L>Ut verum renovem, men&s;ibus atque novem.</L></Q>
<P>Fordun interprets this 1224 years, 3 months.</P>
<P>D. &s;emel; et ter C.; po&s;t X. ter; et X. quater inde. &s;eems to denote that Kenneth began to reign in Dalri|ada, <HI>(&s;ed trans Dunaiban,)</HI> in 844: and he vanqui&s;hed the Piks, <HI>&s;eptennis annis,</HI> or &s;even years after, as our poem &s;ays. Fordun dates Kenneth's reign in Dalriada 834; Winton 843.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t pa&s;&s;age tells us that the Scots came to Bri|tain 443 years before Chri&s;t. The &s;econd that they preceded the Piks 265 years; 3 months. That is the Piks arrived 177 years, 9 months, before Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>The third &s;ays the Piks had ruled 1224 years, 9 months, when in 851 they were vanqui&s;hed by Ken|neth. It follows that the Piks began to rule 373 years,
<PB N="510" REF="598">9 months, before Chri&s;t. How can this be reconciled? The difference is ju&s;t 196 years.</P>
<P>And how reconcile this piece with the <HI>De&s;criptio Al|baniae,</HI> which bears that &s;ome extended the duration of the Piki&s;h kingdom to 1070; others to 1360 years? The numbers are &s;o di&s;cordant, that it is utterly im|po&s;&s;ible to reconcile them; and if it were po&s;&s;ible, the labour were very ill be&s;towed, as the different accounts are equally vi&s;ionary and fanta&s;tic.</P>
<P>But the intention of this little comment was merely to &s;hew, that the numbers even in this poem are irre|concileable. And the rea&s;on is that Innes has gro&s;&s;ly mi&s;taken it's nature. He &s;uppo&s;es, p. 609, that all the part down to Alexander III. is written in his time; and all after by another hand. Yet in his notes on the piece it&s;elf, p. 816, when he comes to the pretended Second Part, he ob&s;erves <HI>Hactenus continentur quae</HI> AUCTOR <HI>ex &s;criptis, &s;ive pri&s;cis chronicis, de&s;ump&s;erat. Hic incipit de|&s;cribere quae vel ip&s;e per &s;e, vel ex coaevorum relatione, no|verat: hinc addendum cen&s;uimus titulum hunc Secunda Pars.</HI> Here we find only one author mentioned: and how he could have lived in different ages is &s;ubmitted to the reader. The fact is, that he lived and wrote in the year 1447; as he tells us in his concluding lines.</P>
<P>This poem can only be found in the end of Fordun; and is, as the preface &s;ays, an ab&s;tract of his chronicle; or rather of the Scoti&s;h chronicle, or hi&s;tory, in general. It is never quoted, nor referred to, either by Fordun or Winton, tho they quote the <HI>Chronicon Elegiacum</HI> often: &s;o that certainly it was not written before their time. The &s;uppo&s;ed Second Part is a mere imagination of Innes. The whole is of one form, and complection. The &s;ame confu&s;ed kind of ver&s;e, &s;ometimes riming at the middle and end; &s;ometimes in couplet; &s;ometimes not riming at all; ju&s;t as the rude compo&s;er could make it, occurs thro-out.</P>
<P>What mi&s;led Innes is, 1. That the author, according to the Paris MS. from which Innes publi&s;hed this piece, &s;ays in his preface he compo&s;ed it, <HI>'&s;cripto veteri metrico, et nova ad propo&s;itum re&s;pondente;'</HI> but the Pai&s;ley MS. reads <HI>'partim ex metris veteribus, partim ex recentibus ad prop$&s;i um facientibus.'</HI> Innes, following the former read|ing, &s;uppo&s;es di&s;tinct parts are implied. But the &s;econd reading explains the fir&s;t to mean only that the author in&s;erted &s;ome old rimes. Which he really has; and with wonderful addre&s;s! For the three lines,
<PB N="511" REF="599">
<Q><L>Qui Picti terram rexere mille, ducentis,</L>
<L>Et pariter junctis viginti quatuor annis,</L>
<L>Ut verum renovem; men&s;ibus atque novem.</L></Q>
are taken literatim from Fordun, who quotes them, I. 31. And our &s;agacious poeta&s;ter breaks a cha&s;m for them, between two lines &s;o clo&s;ely connected, as not even to admit a comma: and without once perceiving that they totally confute what he had ju&s;t &s;aid. At &s;ame time the&s;e <HI>three</HI> lines, and a few marked by Innes as in|terpolated, p. 813, are the only ones in the whole poem, to be found quoted in Fordun, or any where el&s;e before 1447; and it is clear that Fordun did not take them from this poem, but the poem from Fordun.</P>
<P N="2">2. The grand rea&s;on, which induced Innes to infer that this poem is more ancient than Fordun, was, that the li&s;t of our early kings, to be found in it, differs from Fordun's new &s;cheme; and is con&s;onant with our old chronicles: for it omits all Fordun's fictitious mo|narchs, beginning only at Fergus &s;on of Erc, and pa&s;|&s;ing over Fordun's interpolated kings. As the author calls his poem an ab&s;tract of Fordun, this is indeed &s;urprizing. But as he has confe&s;&s;edly told us one fal&s;e|hood, in calling his poem an ab&s;tract of a writer, whom he contradicts; &s;o we know not where, or how, to be|lieve him; for he who deceives us in one in&s;tance, may in others. Innes al&s;o falls into another contradiction, when he &s;uppo&s;es the fir&s;t part of this piece written in the time of Alexander III. yet &s;ays that the idea of the Scots being in Britain before the Piks, was adopted after his reign; while this very poem-a&s;&s;erts the Scots to have been in Britain before the Piks. That there are &s;ome &s;craps in this mi&s;begotten piece, older than 1447, &s;eems clear: but there is no rea&s;on to infer that there is a line in it, written before 1320. And it was in 1447 &s;o al|tered, and interpolated, that no more reliance can be placed on it, than if it were wholly written at that time. So that it cannot be ranked as an early, or authentic, monument of our hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Innes was anxious for proofs that Fergus &s;on of Erc, and not the fabulous Fergus I. was really fir&s;t king of the Scots in Dalriada. This is &s;ufficiently clear from the other two ancient catalogues of our kings, produced by him; and from the Iri&s;h Annals: &s;o that there was no occa&s;ion to give this piece a mock antiquity, to en|force the truth. And as this truth is now allowed on all
<PB N="512" REF="600">hands, it is of no moment that the <HI>Chronicon Rhythmicum</HI> &s;hould be received in the new point of view, in which Innes has placed it. There &s;eems little doubt, from the &s;imilar manner of marking the numerals, down to the very end 1447, that the li&s;t of early monarchs is not an old fragment, but really written in 1447. It indeed differs from Fordun; but we are not to conceive that Fordun's new &s;cheme was univer&s;ally received: and perhaps this difference was owing merely to the indo|lence of the author, who, in&s;tead of turning over For|dun's va&s;t ma&s;s, for the little &s;craps concerning our early kings, found it ea&s;ier to take one of the &s;hort catalogues ready made to his hands, and turn it into ver&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e remarks are here given, becau&s;e had this piece been a real monument of our early hi&s;tory, it would have been proper to have con&s;idered it in Part III. ch. 4, of this work, concerning the epoch of the Piki&s;h &s;ettlement in Britain.</P>
