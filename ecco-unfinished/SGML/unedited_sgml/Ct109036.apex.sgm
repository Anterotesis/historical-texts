<HEAD><HI>HANOVER</HI> OR <HI>ROME,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_I HAVE with great Plea&s;ure ob|&s;erv'd the good Di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;ober and rea&s;onable Part of the Kingdom on the Report of the Pretender's threatning Us with an Inva&s;ion. They &s;eem to be animated with the &s;ame Spi|rit as drove our la&s;t Popi&s;h King out of this I&s;land, and will, I doubt not defend it again&s;t all Pretenders to the Dominion of it, which our Laws have &s;ettled on a Prote&s;tant Line, who are happily in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and will mo&s;t certainly maintain it, to the Confu&s;ion of all their Enemies.</P>
<P>The Abhorrance every hone&s;t thinking Man mu&s;t have of an Inva&s;ion, &s;upported by <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Cut|throats, by fugative Criminals, and beggarly de&s;perate <HI>Tories,</HI> will doubtle&s;s increa&s;e in the Minds of all good
<PB N="4" REF="3">
Subjects, and have &s;o good an Effect, as to make them judge with more Deliberation for the future, and not be impo&s;ed upon by the &s;pecious Pretences of tho&s;e who call them&s;elves the only <HI>True Sons of the Church,</HI> but are indeed the Sons of Sedition and Rebellion, and would &s;ave them&s;elves from the Puni&s;hment they have ju&s;tly de&s;erv'd, by the Ruin of their Country and Religion.</P>
<P>Is there a Man of Common Sen&s;e in the Kingdom, who can flatter him&s;elf, That the Pretender would have it in his Power, if it was in his Will, to &s;upport the Church of <HI>England</HI> When his pretended Father was &s;ent by <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIVth to <HI>Ireland,</HI> had he not the Count <HI>de' Ava$n</HI> to attend him, on purpo&s;e to prevent his doing any thing in Favour of the Prote&s;tants of that Kingdom? Not that King <HI>James</HI> had the lea&s;t Inclina|tion of him&s;elf to be favourabe to them: But while there was a Party in <HI>England,</HI> who under the Deonmi|nation of <HI>Church of</HI> England - Men, promoted on all Occa&s;ions his, and the Popi&s;h Intere&s;t; &s;ome of his Councellors as the Lord <HI>Powis,</HI> the Lord <HI>Dover,</HI> &amp;c. advis'd him, tho' they were Pepi&s;ts, to be more Gra|cious to the Prote&s;tants: But the <HI>French</HI> Mini&s;ter would allow of nothing but Plundering, Murdering; nothing but Fire and Sword, Rapes and Racks, would &s;atisfy the <HI>French</HI> Coun&s;ellers he brought from <HI>France</HI> with him. Nay. 'tis Ob&s;ervable. That the <HI>French</HI> King obliged him to take the very Officers with him, whom he him|&s;elf had made u&s;e of on the like Employment, Mon&s;ieur <HI>Maman,</HI> and Mon&s;ieur <HI>Ro&s;en,</HI> who were the very Men that were &s;ent to <HI>Languedos</HI> to Dragoon the <HI>French</HI> Prote&s;tants, to Pluuder and Spoil their Hou&s;es, Ravi&s;h their Wives and Daughters, Torture them&s;elves, their Fathers and Sons; and commit Cruelties which are not to be parallel'd in all the Hi&s;tories of the Bloody Pagan Per&s;ecutions.</P>
<P>I know it will be objected, That we a&s;&s;ert without Proof; Thus the <HI>Jacobites</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> while King <HI>James</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="4">
was de&s;troying the Prote&s;tanes in <HI>Ireland,</HI> a&s;&s;erted. That the latter liv'd in the full Enjoyment of their Liberties and Pro$perties; and that all the Reports of their be|ing Robb'd and Murder'd were groundle&s;s and malicious They will now doubtle&s;s treat our ju&s;t Apprehen&s;ions of the like U&s;age from his pretended son, as Vi&s;ionary and Chimerical. They will tell us of the fair Things he Promi&s;es in his Declarations, and e&s;pecially of his good Will to the Clergy, whom he is to declare <HI>Independent of the State,</HI> as <HI>Le&s;ley</HI> Writes in one of his trea&s;onable Letters. They will not look back to the barbarous and arbitrary Conduct of <HI>James</HI> IId. to his breach of Laws and Faith; They will in&s;i&s;t upon our tru&s;ting to the Word of his pretended Son; and putting our Selves, our Religion and E&s;tates, entirely into his Hands, and let him do with Us, as he, and his <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Councel|lors &s;hall think fit. What then can we expect from a Per&s;on, who from an Infant has been in&s;tructed to look upon us as a Rebellious Heretical Nation, devoted to De|&s;truction, as &s;oon as the Papi&s;ts could effect it? What can we expect from one who has been told, that the Crown of the&s;e Kingdoms is his Birth-right, and that he has been unju&s;tly kept our of it by his Slaves; that he has been forc'd to live on the Charity of the <HI>French King,</HI> when the Revenues of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> are his Due; to which, <HI>they &s;ay,</HI> he has as good a Title as ei|ther of us has to his Hou&s;e or Land? Will he be more careful of our Church, and our Properties, then King <HI>James</HI> was.</P>
<P>Will he who never knew what it was to live in a Coun|try where Liberty was heard of, or where it was treated otherwi&s;e than as Rebellion and Faction, be more ten|der of our Con&s;titution than our abdicated King; who after having taken &s;o many Oaths to maintain it, gave it up, not only to his own Will, but the Will of his Benefactor, the <HI>French</HI> King? King <HI>James</HI> had a Potent Adver&s;ary in King <HI>William,</HI> and a Powerful People to &s;truggle with, after he had invaded <HI>Ireland.</HI> It was
<PB N="6" REF="5">
therefore good Policy in him to temporize at lea&s;t with the Prote&s;tants; yet &s;uch was his, and his Protector's the <HI>French</HI> King's Inveteracy to them, that contrary to good Policy, he &s;uffer'd his <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Soldiers to u&s;e them wor&s;e than ever Dragoons of <HI>France</HI> treated the <HI>Hugmiots.</HI> What mu&s;t we look for then from the <HI>Pre|tender</HI> to the Throne he Abdicated, when by an <HI>Iri&s;h, French,</HI> and <HI>Tory</HI> Power he has po&s;&s;e&s;t him&s;elf of the So|vereignty, when he has no <HI>Dutch</HI> or <HI>German</HI> League to fear, when we have no Deliverer to have Recour&s;e to; when the <HI>French</HI> King, being &s;trengthned by the Alliance of a Popi&s;h Prince in <HI>Britain,</HI> &s;hall give Laws not only to him but all <HI>Europe,</HI> what will our Revolution be term'd, and all the Acts &s;ub&s;equent to it? Every Man that has paid a Penny to &s;upport the War-again&s;t <HI>France</HI> and King <HI>James</HI> will be deem'd Guilty of high Trea&s;on. In a word, every P$$te&s;tant that has a Penny to lo&s;e, will be a Traytor and Reoel, and he that has not, lie at the Mercy of <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Murderers. It cannot be otherwi&s;e; and yet how are the &s;tupid and blind Po|pulace hurry'd on by Faction to contribute to the Ru|in of that Holy Church for which they affect &s;o much Zeal? Can any one belive that the <HI>French</HI> King will &s;uffer the Impo&s;tor to be le&s;s dependant on him than King <HI>James</HI> was? That after he has Sub&s;i&s;ted him Seven and Twenty Years, and been at Twenty or Thirty Mil|lions Charge about his pretended Father, Mother, Him|&s;elf and their followers, that he will let him be any thing better than his Viceroy, or ever leave him &s;o much Authority as one of his Lievtenant-General of a Province of <HI>France?</HI> And what mu&s;t they think will be the Con&s;equence of our being &s;ubjected to the Ty|ranny of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV? Will he forgive our reducing him to a Condition when he &s;carce thought him&s;elf &s;afe at <HI>Ver&s;aills;</HI> the many hundred Millions he has expend|ed, and the many Di&s;graces that his Arms were attend|ed with? Will he pardon us for robbing him of the Glorious Tittle of <HI>Ever Victorious?</HI> Whill he &s;pare us, that &s;pares not his own Natural Subjects? Will he content
<PB N="7" REF="6">
him&s;elf with our E&s;tates and Liberties? Shall our Re|ligion and Lives be left us, and &s;hall Beggery and Sla|very attone for Here&s;y? Will he not exti$pate us as an Heretical, Stubborn, perver&s;e People, and not &s;uf|fer us to be on the &s;ame &s;ad Terms with one of his own mi&s;erable Provinces? Mu&s;t not the Pretender owe all to him; and what can hinder his recovering the Debt with a word of his Mouth, of ever we &s;hould be &s;o wretched as to come into Subjection to him.</P>
<P>As there is nothing that gives a more lively Idea of things, than In&s;tances of the like which have happen'd before, I &s;hall take from a very credible Author, a Clergy man, a Pa&s;&s;age releating to the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Ire|land,</HI> when King <HI>James</HI> was there; and from thence may we rea&s;onably conclude, what a Shadow of a Prince the <HI>French</HI> King intends the Impo&s;tor &s;hall be.</P>
<P>Before King <HI>James</HI> left <HI>France,</HI> King <HI>Lewis</HI> oblig'd him to Covenant with him that the <HI>French</HI> &s;hould be put into Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Dublin,</HI> and all the places of Strength in <HI>Ireland:</HI> Accordingly, on the 3d of <HI>May,</HI> 1683. Three Battalions of <HI>French</HI> enter'd the City of <HI>Dublin,</HI> and the Count <HI>de Lauzun</HI> their General &s;ent to Collonel <HI>Lutterel</HI> the Governour to deliver the Keys of the City and Ca|&s;tle; <HI>Lutterel</HI> an&s;wer'd, he would fir&s;t acquaint the King, which he did, taking the Lord Mayor and Alder|men with him; the Governour and his Popi&s;h Attend|ants told him, <HI>They had hitherto ventur'd their Lives and Fortunes in his Defence, and therefore hoped he would &s;till en|tru&s;t them with the Government of</HI> Dublin, <HI>and not give the</HI> French <HI>an Ab&s;olute Authority over them.</HI> To whom he reply'd, <HI>That he was engag'd to his Brother of</HI> France, <HI>to give the Government of</HI> Dublin <HI>to the Count de</HI> Lauzun, <HI>and could not recide from it.</HI> Upon which, the <HI>French</HI> General had the Keys of the City delivered to him&punc; but <HI>Lauzun</HI> would not let the <HI>French</HI> Soldiers mount the Guard till he had the Keys of the Ca&s;tle, and the next Day they al&s;o were brought to him. After this, the <HI>French</HI> very
<PB N="8" REF="7">
commonly &s;wore. <HI>They had no King but King</HI> Lewis, <HI>and would obey no Orders but the Count</HI> de Lauzun's, <HI>and they grew &s;o in&s;olent to the</HI> Iri&s;h <HI>as well as</HI> Engli&s;h, <HI>that the Pa|pi&s;t them&s;elves frequently complain'd of them to King</HI> James, <HI>but con$d never have any Redre&s;s,</HI></P>
<P><Q>The Reverend Author &s;ays farther, &startq;The <HI>French</HI> had not been Two Days in <HI>Dublin,</HI> when they Murder'd Two or Three Prote&s;tant Clothiers in a part of that City call'd the <HI>Comb,</HI> for that great Crime of Protect|ing their Wive from being made Pro&s;titutes to their Lu&s;t; of which inhuman Act no Notice was ever ta|ken, tho King <HI>James</HI> was complained to about it. About the &s;ame $ime, &s;ome of them took a Country $aid, who came to Market with her Father, and Ra|vi&s;hed her in the open Street at Noon-Day. Many &s;uen barbarous pieces of Villany were perpetrated by them; and their Leaders moved in Council, that the City &s;hould be Burnt if they could not keep it; whereupon the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> City Papi&s;ts, and tho&s;e of the Army, apply'd them&s;elves to King <HI>James,</HI> repre&s;ent|ing to him, That the Catholicks would be great &s;uf|ferers by that as well as the Ptote&s;tants, and they humbly and earne&s;tly intreated him not to give way&endq; to any &s;uch Council.</Q></P>
<P>It would be endle&s;s if I &s;hould go about to produce Examples of the Superiority of the <HI>French</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the barbarous and bloody U&s;e they made of it. What need is there of Proof by Fact? The Rea&s;on of the Thing is its own Evidence; and wherever the Preten|der prevails, he Acts in entire subordination to his Be|nefactor, and mu&s;t be as much a Slave to his Will, as the Poor deluded <HI>Britons</HI> mu&s;t be to his. Is the Impo|&s;tor worth a Great of his own; has he a Fi&s;hing Boat, has he a Footman, but what he mu&s;t buy, and &s;ub&s;i&s;t by the <HI>French</HI> King's Alms? And whatever Artifice the <HI>French</HI> Court may make u&s;e of to colour their Actions, with whatever Eva&s;ions they may excu&s;e the A&s;&s;i&s;tance
<PB N="9" REF="8">
they give him, it is impo&s;&s;ible for him to Arm and Maintaine a Company of Foot, or hire a <HI>Bilander</HI> to Tran&s;port him to <HI>Britain,</HI> without he is a&s;&s;i&s;ted direct|ly or indirectly by the <HI>French.</HI> His pretended Father King <HI>James</HI> was to have deliver'd up <HI>Port&s;mouth, Pilmouth</HI> and <HI>Hull,</HI> before he went from <HI>England,</HI> for the Supplies of Men and Ships Mon&s;ieur <HI>Bonrepos</HI> offer'd him in the Name of the <HI>French</HI> King his Ma&s;ter. Now if <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIVth cou'd demand Three &s;uch Towns in <HI>England</HI> of King <HI>James,</HI> when he was upon his Throne, and had not an Enemy in Arms again&s;t him in the Three Kingdoms, what will he not exact of his pretended Heir, for the Supply he furni&s;hes him with? What le&s;s than the Three Kingdoms will content him? How could all the Powers of <HI>Europe</HI> prevent their falling into his Hands? The&s;e Con&s;iderations are &s;o natural, &s;o ob|vious, and withal &s;o terrible and affecting, that they need no Exaggeration. Every Reader will tremble at the Thought; and let this ju&s;t Terror &s;o alarm him, as to animate him to a vigorous Defence of the Invalu|able Ble&s;&s;ings we now Enjoy, in a <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> King and <HI>Liberty.</HI></P>
<P>Having &s;hewn that it will not be left in the Preten|der's Power to &s;ecure our Holy Church from the Per|&s;ecution of Papi&s;ts, and <HI>French</HI> Idolaters; I might now argue, that it will not be his Will, that he would not do it if he could, that his fair Speeches are more Gri|mace than tho&s;e of his pretended Father to the Privy Council and Parliament, on his Acce&s;&s;ion to the Throne. But &s;ure &s;uch a Task is needle&s;s. It cannot be ima|gin'd that a Creature of the <HI>French</HI> King's, Taught from his Childhood to look on the Prote&s;tants of the Church of <HI>England</HI> as in a damnable Here&s;y; and to hold that no Faith is to be kept with them, when the Intere&s;ts of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> are concern'd: I &s;ay it can't be imagin'd that &s;uch a per&s;on will ever have the lea&s;t for|bearance with &s;uch an Heretical Generation as he deems the Church of <HI>England</HI> Prote&s;tants to be, but will fol|low
<PB N="10" REF="9">
the Example as well as the In&s;truction of his Protect|or, in rooting out our Religion, and re&s;toring the Papal Tyranny in this Kingdom When his Factitious Father was once apply'd to by Colonel <HI>Sarsfield</HI> to give a Com|mi&s;&s;ion to a Kin&s;man of his, who was a Prote&s;tant, for who&s;e Fidelity the Colonel offer'd to be Bound: He reply'd, <HI>He would tru&s;t no Church of</HI> England <HI>Man</HI> And a little while after, comming from Chapel, he &s;aid to &s;ome Countiers, who were talking of the Prote&s;tants, <HI>That they Stunk in his No&s;trils.</HI> If they were &s;o Offen&s;ive to him who had his Breeding among them, who had been one him&s;elf, and own'd his Conver&s;ion only to the Arguments of that rare Ca&s;u$&s;t Colonel <HI>Richard Talbot,</HI> afterwards Earl of <HI>Tyrconnel,</HI> as the latter bragg'd when he was his Deputy in <HI>Ireland;</HI> What Offence mu&s;t they give to the Impo&s;tor who has been bred up under a <HI>Confe&s;&s;or, Queen Mary</HI> of <HI>M. dena,</HI> the greate&s;t Bigot to Popery in <HI>Chri&s;tendome?</HI> One may &s;uppo&s;e how kind he would be to the <HI>Church of England,</HI> by the <HI>French</HI> King's Kindne&s;s to his own Prote&s;tants. But our Con|dition mu&s;t be wor&s;e; we cou'd not be bani&s;h'd for Re|ligion, <HI>Lewa</HI> wou'd be every where Ma&s;ter; all <HI>Europe</HI> mu&s;t follow the Fate of <HI>England;</HI> there wou'd be no Country left to receive us, or our Relligion wou'd be left to no Country. <HI>Galleys, Gibbets, Whips,</HI> and <HI>Wheels,</HI> all that <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Cruelty and Revenge cou'd in|vent mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be our Lot Poverty and want wou'd be the lea&s;t of our Plagues; we &s;hou'd think our &s;elves happy to pre&s;erve our Religion at the Price of all other Ble&s;&s;ings, at lea&s;t, if there remain'd Virtue and Con&s;cience among us. But alas! we mu&s;t be Poor, we mu&s;t be slaves, we mu&s;t be Idolatrous; or be Rack'd, be Slaughter'd, and the very Name of <HI>Enli&s;hman</HI> and Prote&s;tant be lo&s;t for ever. That the Pretender wou'd treat you thus, if you were Subject to him, is not to be doubted, from the Spirit and Practice of his Protec|tor. Can he po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of Three Kingdoms by the help only of his <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> and <HI>Tory</HI> Fugitives? Suppo&s;e it were po&s;&s;ible, as it is not, that he cou'd $ecucd us by

<P>About a Year ago there was a Report indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread in <HI>England,</HI> that the Pre$enner was turn'd Pro|te&s;tant; is was al&s;o rumour'd Three Years ago, and that vi$e Wretch <HI>Roper</HI> Printed it for News, that <HI>Lo&s;lcy</HI> was gone to Convert him, to hinder our being troubled with <HI>Come overs.</HI> When this Report had prevail'd over &s;ome thoughtle&s;s credulous Tories, and they began to give Credit to it, le&s;t the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> of the Three Kingdoms, on whom the <HI>French</HI> King makes his Dependance, &s;hou'd be di&s;corag'd by &s;uch a Rumour, it was pre&s;ently De|clar'd in the <HI>Paris Gazette,</HI> that it was groundle&s;s, and that the Impo&s;tor di&s;own'd any &s;uch Conver&s;ion. <HI>Lo&s;lcy</HI> goes farther in one of his Trea&s;onable Papers, and &s;ays, <HI>He is re&s;olved not to deceive his good Subjects, by telling them he has renounced Popery; on the Contrary, he a&s;|&s;ures them he never will,</HI> And that Tory Prie&s;t argues, that 'tis for the Intere&s;t and Security of the Prote&s;tant Religion that he never &s;hould.

Their Per&s;ons, as well as E&s;tates, would be Subject to the Will of a Po|pi&s;h Tyrant, and this now Happy and Flouri&s;hing Nati|tion be reduc'd to the utmo&s;t Di&s;tre&s;s and De&s;olation.</P>
<P>I have in &s;everal Places of this Di&s;cour&s;e, made men|tion of King <HI>James</HI>'s Conduct in <HI>Ireland,</HI> becau&s;e he was there in almo&s;t the &s;ame Circum&s;tances as his pretend|ed Heir would be in <HI>England.</HI> With this Difference however, that the Latter would have le&s;s Re&s;traint up|on him, and no Body to plea&s;e but his Friend and Pa|tron the <HI>French</HI> King; whereas King <HI>James</HI> had a Party in <HI>Great Britain</HI> to impo&s;e upon, by preten&s;ions of Fa|vour to the Prote&s;tants, and yet under that Re&s;traint did he deal wor&s;e with them, both with re&s;pect to their Liberties and Properties, than ever the <HI>French</HI> dealt by his Subjects, He put Copper on them for Silver, by one Proclamation dated the 4th of <HI>February,</HI> 1689. He &s;eiz'd upon their mo&s;t Merchantable Commodities, by another Proclamation of the &s;ame Date. And the very &s;ame Day publi&s;h'd another to levy a Tax on them of 10000 <HI>l.</HI> a Month. Here are Three Laws of his own making, more De&s;potick, and more invading on Pro|perty, than any Edict the <HI>French</HI> King ever publi&s;h'd. In&s;tead of Acts of Parliament, your Money would be forc'd from you by Order and Commands. In&s;tead of a Hou&s;e of Commons, you would be Taxed by <HI>Iri&s;h</HI>

Commi&s;&s;ioners; and in&s;tead of Collectors, your Taxes would be levy'd by Granadiers and Dragoons. For whatever our abdicated King did after his Abdication, will mo&s;t certainly be refined upon by his pretended Heir; and all his Maxims, all his Mea&s;ures be impro$'d, to advance one of the mo&s;t grievous and de&s;tructive Tyrannies, by which a Free and Chri&s;tian, Con&s;titution was ever &s;ubverted.</P>
<P>I am &s;atisf$'d I have &s;aid nothing but what every hon|e&s;t and thinking Man is appriz'd of already; yet I could not avoid to remind him of it at this Juncture, when the Enemies of the Government will be very indu&s;tre|ous to corrupt Mens Judgment and delude their Faith by fal&s;e Facts, and fal&s;e Arguments: Some of them &s;uch as <HI>Welton, Sachever$l, Smith,</HI> &amp;c. among the Cler|gy; as <HI>Ca$line, Mawhood, Si$k,</HI> &amp;c among the Laity, will openly a&s;&s;ert the Impo&s;tor's Right, and arrig$ the Government, as they did King <HI>William's</HI> for U&s;urpati|on For the&s;e the &s;ame Laws, and the &s;ame Lodgings are prepar'd, which the Draper <HI>Mawhood,</HI> and his Part|ner <HI>Pace,</HI> are like to make tryal of. Others will, in|&s;tead of att$cking King <HI>George,</HI> entertain you with Pa|negyricks on Queen <HI>Anno;</HI> The Peace; The <HI>A&s;&s;ien$o;</HI> and the Glorious Advantages procur'd for us by the Late Mini&s;ters. Others will wi&s;h, as they tell you, Things may go well; but only they are afraid that &s;ome Men drive too Fa&s;t. The&s;e <HI>Well-wi&s;hers</HI> are errent <HI>Lyars,</HI> thy wi&s;h His Maje&s;ty no better than the profe&s;s'd Friends of the Pretender, and will be ready to declare for him as &s;oon as they think they can do it with Safty. Some will &s;h$ug up their Shoulders and &s;ay nothing, that thy may have the Benefit of Interpreting that Politick Shrug of theirs afterwards, on which Side they plea&s;e, either for the King or the Pretender. In a word, every Man that does not heartily and openly declare again&s;t the In|vaders, ought to be look'd upon and treated as an Ene|my to the Con&s;titution: A Mark ought to be &s;et upon them; that they may always be di&s;tingui&s;h'd from its

Friends by the Re&s;entment and Di&s;regard of our Gover|nors: They will be ready enough to change their Tone when the Danger is over: They will find a hun|dred Excu&s;es for their Malignity and Indifference: They will have Proofs to bring you of, an extraordinary Zeal again&s;t the Impo&s;tor and his Abettors, They will di&s;own their De$inquence, or Neutrality But let it not avail them; let us all have an Eye on &s;uch dangerous or in|&s;ignificant <HI>Britons;</HI> and let every true Lover of the Church and Liberty, &s;ignalize his Loyalty to the King, and his Zeal for our Religion, at this important Jun|cture. Our All is at Stake, if the <HI>Pretender</HI> comes among us; and to be Lukewarm and Wary, when we have no other Chance to pre&s;erve it but the pre&s;ervation of the Government, denotes the mo&s;t fatal Stupidity; and that we are unworthy the Deliverance which providence &s;ent Us a Second Time in King <HI>GEORGE</HI>'s Acce&s;&s;ion to the Throne.</P>
<P>If any where I have &s;eem'd to be aprehen&s;ive of an Iva&s;ion from the Pretender and his <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> and <HI>French Cut-Throats,</HI> it is not an Apprehen&s;ion that ri&s;es from Fear of the Succe&s;s of &s;uch an Attempt, while we have &s;o great and &s;o good a King to protect us, and &s;o Wi&s;e and &s;o Loyal a Parliament to &s;upport Him. There is no In|&s;tance in Story that ever a Con&s;titution &s;o well e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd was &s;ubverted. But that &s;hould be &s;o far from rendring us too &s;ecure, that it &s;hould animate us all to exert our &s;elves to cha&s;ti&s;e the In&s;olence of tho&s;e Inva|ders, and their Abettors; and to take hold of this Oc|ca&s;ion to &s;uppre&s;s that Faction for ever, by putting the Laws in Force again&s;t them in Execution, with the Se|verity that &s;uch Robbers and Rioters de&s;erve.</P>

<P>We may depend upon it, that this Attempt of the <HI>Impo&s;tor</HI> is the Effect of De&s;pair in Him|&s;elf and his Followers.

Vagabonds, headed by a Creature of the <HI>French</HI> King's, who knows le&s;s of his Beginning than he &s;eems to do of his End? I cannot &s;up|po&s;e that our ill U&s;age under the la&s;t $ini&s;tey, did in &s;o &s;hort a Time di&s;pirit us in &s;uch Man|ner, as to render us more ba&s;e and da&s;tardly than our Ance&s;tors. <HI>Wat Tyler</HI> had another gue&s;s Mob at his Heels than the Impo&s;ter is like to have, no le&s;s than 100,000 Men, and all with|in the City of <HI>London,</HI> yet did the Lord-Mayor and his Followers only di&s;per&s;e them in an In|&s;tant, when they came to a firm Re&s;olution to oppo&s;e them to the utmo&s;t. <HI>Perkin Warbeck</HI> was another &s;ort of a <HI>Pretender</HI> than the Chevalier <HI>de St. George,</HI> he was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the <HI>French</HI> King, by the Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> then almo&s;t as Great as the <HI>French</HI> King, by the <HI>Scots</HI> King, at that Time a formidable Enemy to <HI>England</HI> when &s;he had any other. He had al&s;o another Name to pretend to, that of <HI>Plantagenet,</HI> a Royal Race Famous for Heroes. He had a Mob to a&s;&s;i&s;t him as well as all the&s;e Princes. He landed, and march'd his Army a Hundred Miles in the Coun|try; but what was his Fortune, the Stocks fir&s;t the Pillory next, and the Gallows at la&s;t. There was no Hundred Thou&s;ands for his Head. He had liv'd in the Court of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>$urgundy,</HI> as a King; and his Guards and Officers, and &s;ome half witted beggarly <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Lords to follow him.

<P>There never was as an Impo&s;tor that came not to a mi&s;erable End, however for a Time he might &s;eem to flouri&s;h; And it would be a hard Ca&s;e, if we who had beat his Pro|tector the <HI>French</HI> King from one End of <HI>Eu|rope</HI> to the Other, &s;hould not now be able to Beat a Creature of His accompany'd by a few &s;tarvling Pugatives, and cowardly Mer|cenaries. Neverthele&s;s, tho' we do not fear him; tho' we have no Rea&s;on to be afraid of him and all his Abbetors, yet we may by too much Security, &s;o expo&s;e our &s;elves, as to have ju&s;t Grounds for Fear hereafter. If we are too negligens of our own Defence, or have too much Linety for his Friends, we &s;pare them at our own Co&s;t, and are the In&s;truments of our own Peril. I would not be mi&s;taken, That I think we ought to end the Di&s;pute, as the <HI>Tories</HI> would end theirs on the like Occa&s;ion. I am not for u&s;ing Arms where Ju&s;tice can have its Cour&s;e, and only to Support the Execution of the Laws, which at this Time cannot be too General nor too Rigorous.</P>
